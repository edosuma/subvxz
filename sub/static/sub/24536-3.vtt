WEBVTT

00:00.019 --> 00:02.855
Previously on The Originals...
You said there was a way to save her.

00:02.897 --> 00:04.816
We pull the Hollow out of Hope
and I need a place that's

00:04.857 --> 00:07.110
connected to Hope to put it.
When the spell is over,

00:07.151 --> 00:08.611
you got to get away
from each other,

00:08.653 --> 00:10.071
and you have to stay away
from Hope.

00:10.113 --> 00:12.115
If the Mikaelsons come together

00:12.156 --> 00:15.118
it will signal darkness
like we've never known.

00:15.159 --> 00:17.370
Hayley's missing.

00:17.412 --> 00:18.538
I'll find your mother.

00:18.579 --> 00:20.707
And I swear
I'll return her to you.

00:20.748 --> 00:22.917
You see, Marcel,
my disease has always been

00:22.959 --> 00:24.752
blind devotion to my brother.

00:24.794 --> 00:26.462
I'm a danger to my family.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.756
So take away the memories.
Compel me.

00:28.798 --> 00:30.591
The promise of always and forever.

00:30.633 --> 00:32.552
Forget it. Let it go.

00:50.111 --> 00:52.447
You know where you're going, hon?

00:53.990 --> 00:56.868
I ne... I need...

00:58.161 --> 01:00.121
food.

01:00.163 --> 01:02.832
Chicken and waffles,
two miles up the road.

01:02.874 --> 01:04.792
Good luck to you.

01:59.972 --> 02:01.891
Is there a problem?

02:08.689 --> 02:10.233
What is that?

02:10.274 --> 02:11.818
What is what?

02:14.403 --> 02:16.364
That noise.

02:16.405 --> 02:18.991
Okay, um...

02:19.033 --> 02:21.494
you look like
you could use some help.

02:26.999 --> 02:29.418
Hey. Yeah, I got a guy here
that, uh, just put his hand

02:29.460 --> 02:31.921
through our vending machine.
He just punched a hole in it.

02:47.728 --> 02:49.230
Come on!

02:49.272 --> 02:51.524
Aah!

04:16.317 --> 04:18.235
It's okay.

04:18.277 --> 04:20.696
There's nothing to fear.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.949
: There, there.

04:27.828 --> 04:30.665
You're doing wonderfully.

04:34.669 --> 04:36.504
That's right.

04:36.545 --> 04:38.339
Be at peace now.

04:40.216 --> 04:43.094
There you go.

05:06.534 --> 05:09.996
Not big on audiences.

05:10.037 --> 05:11.706
So unless you want to die,

05:11.747 --> 05:14.166
I suggest you run.

05:15.501 --> 05:17.420
I thought I was the only one.

05:24.218 --> 05:26.220
What the hell do you want from me?

05:26.262 --> 05:27.555
Are there more of us?

05:27.596 --> 05:30.141
Wh-Where do we come from?
What...

05:30.182 --> 05:31.559
What are we?

05:31.600 --> 05:32.893
Whatever game you're playing,

05:32.935 --> 05:34.395
I'm not interested.

05:34.437 --> 05:36.772
Please.

05:36.814 --> 05:39.108
I need you to help me.

05:47.158 --> 05:48.993
So what happened to us?

05:50.453 --> 05:53.080
The long and short of it...

05:53.122 --> 05:55.166
uh, you died, but so did I.

05:55.207 --> 05:57.209
And somewhere along the way,

05:57.251 --> 05:59.628
someone decided
we were both worth saving.

06:01.255 --> 06:03.424
You've never heard of vampires?

06:03.466 --> 06:05.634
S-Stories, I think.

06:05.676 --> 06:07.553
Um...

06:07.595 --> 06:09.638
Uh, folklore.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.016
Do I look like folklore to you?

06:14.810 --> 06:16.937
Is there a cure?

06:16.979 --> 06:18.606
Why would you want one?

06:18.647 --> 06:20.649
Are you telling me
that you enjoy this?

06:23.110 --> 06:25.571
It's a small price to pay
for all of our gifts,

06:25.613 --> 06:26.655
don't you think?

06:26.697 --> 06:28.866
Compared to when we were human?

06:28.908 --> 06:30.951
I don't remember anything.

06:30.993 --> 06:32.203
Nothing?

06:33.662 --> 06:37.374
Parents, siblings?

06:37.416 --> 06:39.376
The day that you were turned?

06:39.418 --> 06:42.296
Six days ago...

06:42.338 --> 06:45.424
I woke up on a bus,

06:45.466 --> 06:48.427
and I was just starving.

06:57.311 --> 06:58.729
I was forced to feed.

07:00.648 --> 07:02.066
I...

07:02.108 --> 07:03.984
You tell me what gift

07:04.026 --> 07:05.945
you can possibly see in this.

07:11.784 --> 07:13.160
Listen.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.332
If we were human,
it would sound like a thud.

07:18.374 --> 07:20.167
But we hear the crisp
cracking of varnish

07:20.209 --> 07:21.669
splitting off the wood.

07:21.710 --> 07:24.046
Tiny staccato echoes
as the sound

07:24.088 --> 07:26.132
hits pockets
where sap once flowed,

07:26.173 --> 07:28.300
and the thunderous boom
of the metal legs

07:28.342 --> 07:30.594
vibrating against the floor.

07:30.636 --> 07:33.055
It used to be noise.

07:33.097 --> 07:35.724
Now it's music.

07:35.766 --> 07:38.310
On the other hand,
we also catch fire in the sun,

07:38.352 --> 07:40.312
but hey, nothing's perfect.

07:40.354 --> 07:41.981
I've been in the sun every day.

07:43.649 --> 07:46.318
Oh. You have a daylight ring.

07:49.572 --> 07:51.490
This is...

07:53.284 --> 07:55.286
Do you not have one?

07:55.327 --> 07:57.454
Mm. I prefer the purity of night.

07:59.707 --> 08:03.419
You really have no idea
what happened to you,

08:03.460 --> 08:04.837
do you?

08:04.879 --> 08:07.047
There's a shadow
of something. I...

08:07.089 --> 08:10.759
I think I can see a man.

08:10.801 --> 08:14.096
And he is saying my name,

08:14.138 --> 08:16.056
but I can't remember my name.

08:16.098 --> 08:19.435
And I cannot remember this man's face.

08:19.476 --> 08:21.687
But when I woke up,

08:21.729 --> 08:23.147
I looked at my cufflink

08:23.189 --> 08:25.024
and it had the letter "E"
engraved on it,

08:25.065 --> 08:28.402
so I guess maybe
it begins with "E."

08:28.444 --> 08:31.155
Edmund.

08:31.197 --> 08:32.990
Elliot.

08:33.032 --> 08:34.991
Eleanor.
You pick.

08:35.034 --> 08:36.784
How about we just call you E?

08:36.827 --> 08:40.039
E. Might be simpler.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.499
The first time
I've needed a name.

08:42.541 --> 08:44.335
I have a name, too, you know.
Oh.

08:44.376 --> 08:46.754
: I'm sorry.
Antoinette.

08:46.795 --> 08:49.465
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Antoinette.

08:51.634 --> 08:53.385
Thank you.

09:02.686 --> 09:05.105
So, you have your ring,

09:05.147 --> 09:06.732
some cufflinks.

09:06.774 --> 09:08.859
Is that it?

09:08.901 --> 09:10.986
Not quite.

09:13.906 --> 09:16.283
This is where
you've been living?

09:16.325 --> 09:17.868
If you can call it that.

09:22.498 --> 09:24.041
The way I'm forced to feed,

09:24.083 --> 09:26.502
I'm lucky if my victims
even have a wallet.

09:28.545 --> 09:30.297
Oh, you've never compelled.

09:30.339 --> 09:33.550
Oh, you are in for a treat.

09:33.592 --> 09:36.011
Just by looking
deep into someone's eyes,

09:36.053 --> 09:38.138
you can make them
do whatever you want.

09:39.807 --> 09:41.850
Wait, is that what you were
doing when I found you?

09:43.185 --> 09:45.396
I-I heard you whispering.

09:45.437 --> 09:48.649
I prefer to avoid the struggle.

09:48.691 --> 09:50.985
Is that what you wanted to show me?
Yes.

10:04.123 --> 10:05.624
Maybe you were a butler.

10:08.669 --> 10:10.337
What's this?

10:10.379 --> 10:11.505
I don't know.

10:16.135 --> 10:18.053
I know I didn't write it.

11:19.249 --> 11:21.168
Shall we?

11:21.209 --> 11:23.837
Where did you say

11:23.879 --> 11:26.006
that you heard
about this place again?

11:26.048 --> 11:27.841
I didn't.

11:29.259 --> 11:30.928
I wanted to surprise you.

11:30.969 --> 11:34.556
You're an amnesiac
with zero life experience.

11:34.598 --> 11:37.225
You really think you ought
to be planning surprises?

11:37.267 --> 11:39.770
Consider it a thank-you

11:39.811 --> 11:42.356
for taking me under your wing
these past few weeks.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.608
I mean, I'd just take you
someplace nice, and...

11:44.650 --> 11:47.945
I promise to get you home
by midnight.

11:47.986 --> 11:50.322
Sounds wholesome.

11:50.364 --> 11:53.158
If you prefer debauchery...

11:53.200 --> 11:54.993
we can do that.

11:55.035 --> 11:57.621
Well...

11:57.663 --> 11:59.831
now I'm intrigued.

12:26.233 --> 12:28.860
Let's get this party started!

12:39.204 --> 12:40.747
Surprise.

12:40.789 --> 12:44.042
I found more of us.

13:00.392 --> 13:03.186
I'm just gonna get another shot.

13:16.074 --> 13:17.159
Merci.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.952
VoilÃ . Oh, good evening, monsieur.

13:22.289 --> 13:24.291
What happened? You disappeared.

13:24.332 --> 13:26.251
Hundred-year-old recipe.

13:28.962 --> 13:32.591
His mother bakes them every day
for her friends in Manosque.

13:32.632 --> 13:34.593
It's lovely there.

13:34.634 --> 13:36.970
Peaceful.
Did I do something wrong?

13:39.097 --> 13:41.475
I appreciated the gesture.

13:41.516 --> 13:42.642
But what?

13:42.684 --> 13:46.271
I don't do group feeds.

13:46.313 --> 13:48.523
Besides, vampires like that

13:48.565 --> 13:50.817
have a thing
about vampires like me.

13:50.859 --> 13:52.694
I don't understand. They
didn't even know you, right?

13:52.736 --> 13:54.279
Sure, they do.

13:54.321 --> 13:56.573
I don't wear the ring.
I don't feed like them.

13:56.615 --> 13:57.991
Do you know how many times
they've threatened

13:58.033 --> 14:00.368
to tie me up and burn me in the sun?

14:00.410 --> 14:03.622
I'm so sorry, Antoinette. I...

14:08.335 --> 14:11.296
I had no idea.
You seem so happy.

14:13.256 --> 14:14.591
I am.

14:19.387 --> 14:22.057
The family that turned me

14:22.099 --> 14:23.892
had all these rules

14:23.934 --> 14:26.311
about how to be a vampire.

14:26.353 --> 14:29.731
Felt like I'd suddenly
entered into a convent.

14:29.773 --> 14:31.733
So I walked away.

14:31.775 --> 14:34.236
And I struggled...

14:34.277 --> 14:35.862
for years.

14:35.904 --> 14:37.948
Obsessing about my old life,

14:37.989 --> 14:40.325
the friends and family
that I'd lost.

14:40.367 --> 14:43.036
And then one day I realized...

14:43.078 --> 14:45.122
it was the daylight ring.

14:45.163 --> 14:46.915
It let me live in the sun,

14:46.957 --> 14:49.000
pretending to be human.

14:49.042 --> 14:52.671
I couldn't embrace
what I'd become.

14:52.712 --> 14:54.172
So I...

14:54.214 --> 14:57.217
I took the ring off again.

14:57.259 --> 15:00.137
Returned to what
I'd been taught by my family.

15:00.178 --> 15:02.639
Now, their rules ground me.

15:02.681 --> 15:06.351
It's the only way
that I've found happiness.

15:06.393 --> 15:08.311
You all right?

15:12.482 --> 15:15.193
I'm sorry. All this talk
about my past...

15:15.235 --> 15:17.863
it must be hard to hear.

15:19.990 --> 15:21.992
What if I never remember?

15:22.033 --> 15:24.744
You want peace of mind?

15:24.786 --> 15:26.913
Accept who you are now.

15:33.336 --> 15:34.671
Mm.

15:34.713 --> 15:37.299
Most wear the rings

15:37.340 --> 15:39.342
and mingle with the humans

15:39.384 --> 15:41.595
as if nothing had happened.

15:41.636 --> 15:43.930
As if we never died.

15:43.972 --> 15:47.642
But we did.

15:47.684 --> 15:50.896
And we can't forget that.

15:54.024 --> 15:56.860
My death was brutal.

15:56.902 --> 16:00.197
Tied to a stake
and stoned by my village.

16:00.238 --> 16:03.158
I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

16:04.784 --> 16:08.079
But I'm in control now.

16:08.121 --> 16:10.123
And I get to choose:

16:10.165 --> 16:12.959
I can either slaughter
my prey carelessly

16:13.001 --> 16:15.837
and lose myself in
that same violence...

16:18.006 --> 16:21.927
or I can be mindful,

16:21.968 --> 16:24.804
compassionate in
their last moments.

16:26.890 --> 16:29.935
When I do that,
everyone benefits.

16:29.976 --> 16:31.770
How do you mean?
Well,

16:31.811 --> 16:33.521
human chemistry is delicate.

16:33.563 --> 16:36.816
When they die, their bodies
are flooded with hormones.

16:36.858 --> 16:38.443
Terrify them and you're drinking

16:38.485 --> 16:41.238
from a well of cortisol.

16:41.279 --> 16:44.449
Blood tainted with fear.

16:46.952 --> 16:49.371
I've never tasted that fear.

16:51.248 --> 16:53.750
That's all you've ever tasted.

17:10.349 --> 17:13.060
Oh, you're doing wonderfully.

17:13.103 --> 17:15.146
Yeah.

17:15.188 --> 17:17.440
That's it.

17:37.711 --> 17:40.880
Yeah, that's it.

17:54.686 --> 17:57.105
Was it worth it?

18:02.485 --> 18:05.655
Without question.
Mm.

18:08.158 --> 18:10.577
So, I take it that's the ritual.

18:10.618 --> 18:12.954
Burial by water?

18:12.996 --> 18:15.332
Yes.

18:15.373 --> 18:18.084
And then I fly back
to Transylvania.

18:18.126 --> 18:19.919
Interesting.
Where, presumably,

18:19.961 --> 18:22.547
you sleep hanging upside down.

18:26.885 --> 18:29.512
And he speaks French,
apparently.

18:30.764 --> 18:33.475
Apparently. Wow.

18:33.516 --> 18:36.227
But can he play?

19:07.801 --> 19:09.969
Put your fingers on mine.

19:23.358 --> 19:26.611
Wait.

19:26.653 --> 19:29.030
I know this feeling.

19:29.072 --> 19:32.033
I know this.

19:43.753 --> 19:45.713
We're being watched.

19:46.756 --> 19:47.841
Elijah.

19:49.384 --> 19:51.094
What the hell
are you doing here?

20:02.756 --> 20:04.299
Who are you?

20:04.341 --> 20:06.009
It doesn't matter.

20:06.051 --> 20:08.804
What matters is somebody's
coming back to town soon,

20:08.845 --> 20:10.931
and you can't be anywhere
near her when she does.

20:10.972 --> 20:12.516
Please. Who is she?

20:13.934 --> 20:15.268
You need to leave this city.

20:15.310 --> 20:17.062
Get away from him.

20:17.104 --> 20:18.522
This doesn't concern you.

20:18.563 --> 20:21.149
Go now,

20:21.191 --> 20:22.901
or I'll kill you both.

20:25.153 --> 20:26.613
That was him.

20:26.655 --> 20:29.533
That was the man, the face
that I couldn't remember.

20:29.574 --> 20:32.577
Elijah.

20:32.619 --> 20:33.954
We have to go after him.

20:33.995 --> 20:35.706
He threatened to kill us.

20:35.747 --> 20:37.082
This man knows who I am.

20:37.124 --> 20:38.792
It's a suicide mission.

20:38.834 --> 20:41.670
And the sun's almost up.
Okay, so,

20:41.712 --> 20:43.880
let me spend the day tomorrow
finding out whatever I can,

20:43.922 --> 20:46.758
and then as soon as
it is dark, you and I...

20:46.800 --> 20:49.678
Can dive headfirst into whatever
drama you left behind?

20:49.720 --> 20:51.304
Even if it kills us?

20:51.346 --> 20:54.433
Don't let me do this on my own.

20:54.474 --> 20:56.017
I can't.

20:57.602 --> 21:00.397
But we both know
that you have to.

21:02.858 --> 21:06.194
This road of yours...

21:06.236 --> 21:08.405
it's dangerous.

21:08.447 --> 21:09.906
Who knows where it ends

21:09.948 --> 21:11.992
or what you'll find out
along the way.

21:12.033 --> 21:15.620
It's okay.

21:15.662 --> 21:17.622
I've been there.

21:17.664 --> 21:20.000
I understand.

21:20.041 --> 21:23.503
But that's not
how I live my life.

21:23.545 --> 21:25.422
Not anymore.

21:33.054 --> 21:34.806
Good luck.

21:34.848 --> 21:36.767
Elijah.

21:38.185 --> 21:39.770
It was nice...

21:39.811 --> 21:42.522
sharing New York City with you.

22:36.785 --> 22:38.829
Elijah.

22:38.870 --> 22:40.247
Even without memories,

22:40.288 --> 22:42.958
you are still a pain in my ass.

22:42.999 --> 22:45.460
Did you forget how to read, too?

22:45.502 --> 22:48.046
What are you talking about?

22:48.088 --> 22:50.841
The note in your pocket.

22:52.342 --> 22:54.761
How do you know about that?

23:00.809 --> 23:02.477
I wrote it.

23:04.688 --> 23:06.565
Who are you?

23:06.606 --> 23:08.942
Let it go.
Tell me why you wrote it.

23:08.984 --> 23:12.320
Tell me wh...
Because you asked me to!

23:20.412 --> 23:23.790
You did this for someone.

23:23.832 --> 23:26.751
A kid. A girl.

23:26.793 --> 23:28.378
And she means everything to you.

23:28.420 --> 23:30.589
And if you keep going
down this path,

23:30.630 --> 23:33.592
the one who's gonna
pay the price is her.

23:35.010 --> 23:37.095
You did the right thing.

23:38.221 --> 23:40.682
Trust yourself, Elijah.

23:43.602 --> 23:46.730
And make a life somewhere else.

25:05.976 --> 25:07.936
What are you doing here?

25:07.978 --> 25:09.270
Looking for you.

25:16.820 --> 25:20.490
Did you learn anything
about... who you are?

25:22.993 --> 25:24.619
Only that...

25:24.661 --> 25:27.205
obsessing about my past...

25:27.247 --> 25:29.874
it brings me nothing but misery

25:29.916 --> 25:31.751
and torment.

25:35.588 --> 25:37.507
And that I miss you.

25:43.888 --> 25:45.890
Can you forgive me?

25:47.934 --> 25:50.145
There's nothing to forgive.

25:51.938 --> 25:54.315
Viens ici.

26:23.752 --> 26:25.670
Merci beaucoup.

26:31.050 --> 26:32.427
: Hmm.

26:34.137 --> 26:36.181
What is it?

26:37.849 --> 26:40.435
Seven years ago,
I walked into this bar.

26:42.061 --> 26:44.063
Seeing you...

26:44.105 --> 26:47.233
is a sensation
I don't think I could...

26:47.275 --> 26:49.569
describe to you.

26:51.488 --> 26:53.239
I'll tell you this.

26:55.366 --> 26:57.577
Whoever I am now...

26:57.619 --> 27:00.455
I want you.

27:04.125 --> 27:06.544
If you'll have me.

27:10.089 --> 27:12.008
No, no, no, wait.
What?

27:12.050 --> 27:14.302
We're gonna need some champagne.

27:32.320 --> 27:34.405
Looking for this?

27:35.532 --> 27:39.452
1928 Clos du Monet.

27:39.494 --> 27:41.579
Hmm. Pricey.

27:43.832 --> 27:45.917
Do you know who I am?

27:45.959 --> 27:50.004
Someone who's about to regret
his hideous timing.

27:50.046 --> 27:53.508
You've spent a handful
of years with Elijah.

27:53.550 --> 27:56.052
You've treated him well,
you've taken good care of him.

27:56.094 --> 27:57.971
I suppose
I should be thanking you.

27:58.012 --> 28:01.266
But alas, all good things
come to an end.

28:01.307 --> 28:04.269
I'm afraid your services
are no longer required.

28:04.310 --> 28:05.645
You see...

28:05.687 --> 28:09.983
I'm taking
my brother home tonight.

28:11.609 --> 28:13.903
You're done with Elijah.

28:13.945 --> 28:16.239
You're going to reject
his proposal,

28:16.281 --> 28:19.576
and then you're going
to exit this bar

28:19.617 --> 28:21.786
and my brother's life...

28:21.828 --> 28:23.371
forever.

28:24.664 --> 28:26.666
Do you understand?

28:27.792 --> 28:29.878
I understand.

28:29.919 --> 28:31.337
Hmm.

28:35.884 --> 28:38.094
What happened to the champagne?

28:38.136 --> 28:39.971
I have something to tell you,

28:40.013 --> 28:41.973
and it won't be easy to hear.

28:44.475 --> 28:46.102
Play with me.

28:50.148 --> 28:52.567
What's going on?

28:58.072 --> 29:00.366
When I came here,

29:00.408 --> 29:03.077
I tried to force myself
to forget you...

29:04.412 --> 29:06.748
to stay present,

29:06.789 --> 29:10.501
to give up all hope
that you'd ever show up.

29:10.543 --> 29:12.337
And then you did.

29:12.378 --> 29:14.964
And these years...

29:15.006 --> 29:17.383
they've been the happiest
of my life, too.

29:17.425 --> 29:20.303
But what is it?

29:20.345 --> 29:23.848
It seems that your past
has caught up with you.

29:23.890 --> 29:26.184
Keep playing.

29:26.225 --> 29:28.728
Keep playing.

29:28.770 --> 29:32.523
There was a man waiting for me
in the kitchen.

29:33.900 --> 29:35.610
He tried to compel me

29:35.652 --> 29:37.528
to walk away from you forever.

29:39.405 --> 29:42.241
He said that he's come
to take you home.

29:42.283 --> 29:45.578
Antoinette...

29:45.620 --> 29:48.706
get everyone out of here.

29:48.748 --> 29:51.334
Immediately.

29:55.088 --> 29:56.673
Please.

29:59.425 --> 30:02.428
On ferme.

30:02.470 --> 30:04.764
Vous devez tous partir.

30:39.382 --> 30:42.093
Your name is Elijah Mikaelson.

30:42.135 --> 30:45.847
You may not remember
yourself or your family,

30:45.888 --> 30:48.182
but we need your help.

30:48.224 --> 30:51.185
Our family is in crisis.

30:51.227 --> 30:54.147
I've come to take you
back to New Orleans.

30:58.939 --> 31:00.441
Say something, brother.

31:00.483 --> 31:03.402
I'm not your brother.

31:03.444 --> 31:06.363
You are. And your family
needs you home.

31:06.405 --> 31:08.407
This is my home.
This is not a request.

31:08.449 --> 31:11.952
You will return with me,
willingly or otherwise.

31:18.375 --> 31:21.295
It'll have to be otherwise.

31:25.049 --> 31:27.468
We made a vow.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.220
Always and forever.

31:29.261 --> 31:31.514
You're talking
about somebody else's life.

31:31.555 --> 31:33.557
No, this is still your life!

31:33.599 --> 31:35.935
You have responsibilities!

31:35.976 --> 31:39.021
You cannot just abandon them
for a fairy tale, playing piano

31:39.063 --> 31:40.439
in the French countryside!

31:40.481 --> 31:42.441
I'm just gonna stand by
and watch

31:42.483 --> 31:45.277
as you destroy everything
that I've built here?

31:47.363 --> 31:49.323
Do you honestly think
you have a choice?

32:02.586 --> 32:06.173
You have no idea the risk
I'm taking simply by being here!

32:06.215 --> 32:09.760
There are consequences to us
being together! Don't you see?

32:09.802 --> 32:11.136
So leave!

32:12.596 --> 32:14.765
I would never have come

32:14.807 --> 32:16.517
if the circumstances
weren't dire.

32:16.559 --> 32:19.770
I don't care.

32:19.812 --> 32:22.064
Your reasons don't matter to me.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.650
You once convinced me

32:24.692 --> 32:26.652
that Hayley's life was worth saving,

32:26.694 --> 32:28.988
that my daughter's life
was worth saving.

32:33.075 --> 32:34.743
Please, Elijah.

32:36.036 --> 32:37.788
Hayley is missing.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.832
Hayley.

32:39.874 --> 32:43.544
Even in your addled state, that
name must mean something to you!

32:46.171 --> 32:48.757
No more than the name Mikaelson.

32:49.884 --> 32:52.094
We are your family!

32:53.554 --> 32:55.347
You love us.

32:55.389 --> 32:57.391
You love me.

33:12.406 --> 33:15.367
We have to get to the catacombs.

33:15.409 --> 33:17.119
There are tunnels beneath us.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.579
Klaus can't die.

33:18.621 --> 33:22.291
That stake...
Was quite an inconvenience.

33:23.918 --> 33:26.503
Unless you'd like me
to return the favor, luv,

33:26.545 --> 33:28.422
I suggest you run along.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.217
I'm not going anywhere with you.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.513
I'm begging you, brother.

33:36.555 --> 33:38.599
You may not think you know me.

33:38.641 --> 33:42.311
Or Rebekah or Kol or Freya
or Hope or even Hayley.

33:42.353 --> 33:45.731
But we are your family.

33:45.773 --> 33:48.901
Everyone you love needs you now.

33:48.943 --> 33:51.111
Everyone I love is right here.

33:52.488 --> 33:54.490
And don't waste your breath.

33:54.531 --> 33:57.242
I know exactly who I am.

33:58.827 --> 34:00.788
See, I ran into

34:00.829 --> 34:03.666
Marcel Gerard a few years ago
in New York City.

34:03.707 --> 34:05.042
He tell you about that?

34:06.543 --> 34:08.170
I didn't recognize him,
of course,

34:08.212 --> 34:09.588
but he did say my name.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.799
And that was all
that I needed to learn about

34:11.840 --> 34:13.257
my former life.
So, yeah,

34:13.300 --> 34:15.094
I don't have all the memories,

34:15.135 --> 34:18.639
but I know all about you...

34:18.681 --> 34:23.143
and Rebekah, Kol, Freya,

34:23.185 --> 34:27.272
Hope, and even Hayley.

34:27.313 --> 34:30.900
And I don't care
about any of you.

34:32.695 --> 34:36.072
You may have a wealth
of knowledge at your disposal...

34:36.114 --> 34:38.742
facts, figures,
names, and dates...

34:38.784 --> 34:40.494
but you lack all the feelings.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.913
The love and the loyalty.

34:42.955 --> 34:46.208
A thousand years of family!

34:46.250 --> 34:48.460
Elijah Mikaelson spent every day
of his wretched life

34:48.502 --> 34:51.213
trying to save you
from yourself.

34:51.255 --> 34:54.216
I mean, I can't even imagine
a more miserable existence.

34:54.257 --> 34:55.634
From what I understand,

34:55.676 --> 34:58.137
that poor bastard
was lucky to find...

34:58.178 --> 35:00.681
any moment of pleasure.

35:02.349 --> 35:04.977
That's not me.

35:05.019 --> 35:07.938
That's not who I am.

35:12.026 --> 35:13.944
I love this life.

35:15.070 --> 35:17.740
I love it all.

35:18.949 --> 35:21.201
I love the quiet of the night.

35:21.243 --> 35:25.706
The taste of my prey when they
truly embrace their demise.

35:25.748 --> 35:29.043
I worship every single dawn
that I spend here,

35:29.084 --> 35:33.005
here, where I'm truly,
truly loved.

35:34.131 --> 35:36.759
Such poetry.

35:38.844 --> 35:42.431
But it means nothing
without family,

35:42.473 --> 35:45.392
without purpose.

35:45.434 --> 35:49.730
You... were not unhappy.

35:49.772 --> 35:50.898
No.

35:50.939 --> 35:53.817
You were a king amongst men.

35:53.859 --> 35:55.444
We both were,

35:55.486 --> 35:58.489
standing shoulder to shoulder
through the ages.

35:58.530 --> 36:02.701
We had glorious times together.

36:02.743 --> 36:05.788
And we will have
more of them still.

36:08.624 --> 36:12.836
Please, Elijah...

36:23.347 --> 36:26.058
Elijah Mikaelson is dead.

36:57.204 --> 37:00.166
You need to grab your suitcase.

37:00.207 --> 37:02.335
Mine is almost full.

37:05.212 --> 37:07.381
We really need to get moving.

37:07.423 --> 37:09.342
You knew that Klaus

37:09.383 --> 37:11.218
was an Original.

37:11.260 --> 37:13.721
You knew a stake
wouldn't kill him.

37:13.763 --> 37:15.723
And you knew that he
couldn't compel you.

37:18.225 --> 37:20.227
You knew about me.

37:23.314 --> 37:26.275
How long
you been taking vervain?

37:32.406 --> 37:35.785
Since the first time
that I saw you.

37:35.826 --> 37:38.204
I knew exactly who you were.

37:38.245 --> 37:41.207
The stories about your family

37:41.248 --> 37:43.209
are legendary.

37:43.250 --> 37:46.212
You have enemies
all over the world.

37:46.253 --> 37:49.256
Your own note said,
"Don't look back."

37:49.298 --> 37:52.468
What if I told you something
that put you in danger?

37:56.430 --> 37:58.432
I'm sorry that I lied.

37:58.474 --> 38:02.103
But I wasn't the only one
carrying around a secret.

38:02.144 --> 38:04.730
Why did you hide who you are
from me?

38:04.772 --> 38:09.151
Mikaelsons are nothing
but chaos and bloodshed.

38:09.193 --> 38:11.862
I don't want you
to know that part of me.

38:18.202 --> 38:21.163
But that's not who you are.

38:21.205 --> 38:24.125
It's not who you've become.

38:26.293 --> 38:28.170
We choose who we are.

38:28.212 --> 38:30.965
Every day, every moment.

38:31.006 --> 38:33.259
I learned that a long time ago.

38:33.300 --> 38:37.471
And I've remembered it again,
watching you.

38:37.513 --> 38:41.934
Please, I know we still
have a lot to talk about,

38:41.976 --> 38:43.602
but we need to go
before the sun comes up

38:43.644 --> 38:45.438
or Klaus comes back and...

38:45.479 --> 38:46.856
tears us both to pieces.

38:46.897 --> 38:47.982
He's not coming back.

38:48.023 --> 38:49.316
You don't know that.

38:49.358 --> 38:51.902
Yes, I do.

38:51.944 --> 38:56.323
They say Elijah Mikaelson
was his North Star,

38:56.365 --> 38:59.076
that he guided Klaus
through the darkest parts

38:59.118 --> 39:01.078
of his pathetic life.

39:01.120 --> 39:04.415
So to renounce that family,

39:04.457 --> 39:08.419
to renounce him
the way that I did,

39:08.461 --> 39:11.046
I saw it.

39:11.088 --> 39:15.885
I watched the light vanish
from his eyes.

39:20.014 --> 39:21.640
This immovable man,

39:21.682 --> 39:25.770
this legendary
Niklaus Mikaelson was...

39:25.811 --> 39:27.062
broken.

39:27.104 --> 39:29.565
Freya...

39:29.607 --> 39:33.194
I couldn't find him in France.

39:34.779 --> 39:36.071
He's gone.

39:38.032 --> 39:40.743
So, yes, Antoinette,
he's leaving.

39:44.246 --> 39:46.791
He's leaving,
and he's not coming back.

39:46.832 --> 39:50.628
And... who is Hayley?

39:50.669 --> 39:53.714
Someone Elijah Mikaelson
used to love.

39:53.756 --> 39:56.926
Once upon a time.

39:56.967 --> 39:59.929
That was another lifetime.

39:59.970 --> 40:03.224
I can't imagine loving anyone
the way I love you.

40:04.350 --> 40:06.644
So,

40:06.685 --> 40:08.521
weren't we gonna get
some champagne?

40:08.562 --> 40:10.481
Well,

40:10.523 --> 40:12.733
you can still go out.

40:12.775 --> 40:15.069
No.
What-what are you...

40:15.110 --> 40:16.821
what are you doing?

40:18.906 --> 40:21.283
If I do this,

40:21.325 --> 40:23.786
I want you to know
that I'm all in.

40:23.828 --> 40:25.996
Okay?

40:27.623 --> 40:31.085
See, I might not be able to die
in the sun, but...

40:31.126 --> 40:33.462
I need you to see
this is everything to me.

40:43.097 --> 40:44.473
Marry me.

40:44.515 --> 40:46.475
Yes.

40:46.517 --> 40:48.185
A thousand times,

40:48.227 --> 40:49.812
yes.

41:01.699 --> 41:03.325
One more thing.

41:11.250 --> 41:12.835
What are you doing?

41:16.672 --> 41:20.426
I'm leaving my past
in the ashes.

41:30.811 --> 41:34.440
Good-bye, Elijah Mikaelson.

41:35.305 --> 41:41.942
