00:23.550 --> 00:27.140
I brought gloves and a scarf,
like you said.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.640
- I was afraid you weren't gonna come.
- Well, to be honest...

00:30.770 --> 00:32.940
I don't think that a "mystery date's"

00:33.060 --> 00:34.980
exactly what our relationship needs.

00:35.270 --> 00:37.320
That's why I called.

00:38.240 --> 00:40.150
Are you okay?

00:40.400 --> 00:43.240
Oh, my God. Your heart's racing.

00:43.370 --> 00:44.830
Because I'm terrified.

00:45.990 --> 00:47.740
What's going on?

00:50.620 --> 00:53.170
Lana, the way you've been...

00:53.670 --> 00:56.550
I can tell by the way you look at me
that I'm losing you.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.210
- Clark...
- And it's not your fault.

01:02.550 --> 01:05.760
There's something I should've shown you
a long time ago.

01:11.640 --> 01:14.440
I don't remember
this place ever being here.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.150
How'd you find it?

01:16.270 --> 01:18.610
It was left here for me.

01:19.990 --> 01:21.650
For you?

01:24.620 --> 01:27.530
I rehearsed this like a thousand times.

01:29.950 --> 01:32.410
Lana, what I'm about to show you...

01:32.540 --> 01:35.290
may change the way you feel
about me.

01:36.590 --> 01:38.800
Clark, whatever it is, it's okay.

01:47.260 --> 01:49.060
It's okay.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.190
Do you trust me?

02:17.460 --> 02:19.340
Oh, my God.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.520
When you asked me if I believed in
life on other planets...

02:39.650 --> 02:42.280
you had no idea
how ironic that question was.

02:49.450 --> 02:51.830
I'm from a planet called Krypton.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.380
But you're just like everyone else.

03:29.570 --> 03:32.660
This isn't the first time you've done that,
is it?

03:35.500 --> 03:39.500
How many times have you been there
when I didn't know it, saving me?

03:40.830 --> 03:44.590
It doesn't matter, Lana.
I couldn't let anything happen to you.

03:49.970 --> 03:51.550
And no one knew.

03:52.430 --> 03:55.600
There were so many days
I wanted to tell you.

03:56.430 --> 03:58.140
What makes today any different?

04:00.150 --> 04:02.400
I want you to know who I really am.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.730
Will you marry me?

05:39.200 --> 05:42.120
- That's the worst joke I ever heard.
- Come on, you liked it.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.330
I didn't.

05:43.620 --> 05:45.830
I thought you were gonna meet us
at the polls.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.630
I kinda took a shortcut.

05:47.750 --> 05:49.880
Get this loaded up
before the victory party.

05:50.010 --> 05:52.970
I appreciate your confidence,
but I haven't won anything yet.

05:53.090 --> 05:55.760
Mom, Dad, I have something important
to tell you.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.180
I told Lana everything.

06:02.270 --> 06:03.940
What?

06:05.650 --> 06:08.860
Right before I proposed to her,
in the fortress.

06:09.940 --> 06:12.440
So, what did she say?

06:12.610 --> 06:15.570
I asked her not to tell me.
It's a lot to put on her at once.

06:15.700 --> 06:18.490
Clark, have you really
thought this whole thing through?

06:18.660 --> 06:20.950
If I was ever gonna risk sharing
who I am...

06:21.080 --> 06:22.450
I want it to be with her.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.000
I'm proud of you, Clark.

06:24.500 --> 06:27.330
I know this has been weighing
on you for a long time.

06:29.090 --> 06:33.760
Just like with this election,
any big decision has risks with it.

06:34.170 --> 06:37.590
I guess it's just hard...

06:37.720 --> 06:41.640
looking over at your son
and realizing you're talking to a man.

06:42.850 --> 06:45.810
A man who doesn't need
his father's advice anymore.

06:48.020 --> 06:50.360
I'm always gonna need you, Dad.

06:59.990 --> 07:03.040
Any exit poll results for the 39th yet?

07:03.160 --> 07:07.750
Yeah, I know it's early,
but patience isn't my strong suit.

07:07.870 --> 07:09.500
Okay. Call me back.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.170
Oh, yeah.

07:13.460 --> 07:15.130
Thanks.

07:15.260 --> 07:19.010
I try to keep the junk food
so I can't reach it.

07:19.140 --> 07:23.560
But some days
it's easier to reach than others.

07:24.770 --> 07:26.140
Sorry I'm late.

07:27.770 --> 07:30.810
I'm glad you're here.
The decorating committee can't bunt.

07:30.940 --> 07:33.150
Can you grab that for me?

07:40.280 --> 07:43.120
Okay, spill it.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.410
It's nothing.

07:46.750 --> 07:50.880
Three guesses: Tall, dark
and bumbling.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.880
It's just...

07:55.760 --> 07:58.510
Okay, what would you do
if you thought...

07:58.630 --> 08:00.180
you knew someone well...

08:00.300 --> 08:03.760
"and" it turns out that "there's...

08:04.720 --> 08:09.480
There's this whole other side to them?

08:09.640 --> 08:12.860
Well, that depends.
Are we in arms-dealer territory...

08:12.980 --> 08:15.280
or are we talking "The Crying Game?"

08:16.360 --> 08:18.610
Nothing like that.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.450
Then I guess the question is...

08:21.570 --> 08:24.780
does it change the way you feel
about him?

08:26.540 --> 08:28.160
Maybe.

08:30.580 --> 08:32.460
Look, I don't know what's going on.

08:32.580 --> 08:38.549
But I would be lucky to end up with
someone as honorable as Clark someday.

08:44.930 --> 08:48.180
- You told Lana your secret?
- Yeah.

08:52.810 --> 08:54.230
Okay.

08:54.360 --> 08:58.360
God, and after all those years
of me yanking on your closet door...

08:58.490 --> 09:01.240
what's the reason
for this sudden coming-out party?

09:01.360 --> 09:03.950
It was only a matter of weeks
before she broke it off.

09:04.070 --> 09:06.240
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

09:06.370 --> 09:10.210
You guys are, like, meant for each other.
You're Kansas' Ken and Barbie.

09:10.330 --> 09:12.250
Except they broke up, which is weird.

09:12.370 --> 09:15.840
- You're fired!
- You can't fire me! I quit!

09:18.880 --> 09:21.880
Well, I think I was pushing Lana
to the point...

09:22.010 --> 09:24.550
where I don't know
we could have come back from.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.390
And I love her too much
to let that happen.

09:27.510 --> 09:30.600
So how did she take the whole
"E.T. Phone home" thing?

09:30.730 --> 09:33.400
Not sure yet. I was hoping
she would've called by now.

09:36.230 --> 09:37.770
Hello?

09:38.190 --> 09:41.820
No, this isn't Mr. Fu's Noodle House.
Sorry.

09:42.490 --> 09:45.870
Clark, if Lana cares about you
as much as I know she does...

09:45.990 --> 09:48.910
I seriously doubt
anything's gonna change.

09:50.450 --> 09:52.370
One thing might.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.920
I haven't gotten my answer yet.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.670
I asked her to marry me.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.720
Well, that one wasn't on the Doppler.

10:06.850 --> 10:07.930
Not even a blip.

10:08.050 --> 10:09.640
I know what you're gonna say.

10:09.760 --> 10:12.730
That we're too young,
there's a reason I hadn't told her...

10:12.850 --> 10:15.400
- that there's too much at stake...
- That's funny...

10:16.560 --> 10:19.770
because what I was gonna say is,
there are few people...

10:19.900 --> 10:22.190
who really know what they want...

10:22.530 --> 10:25.360
and are willing to risk everything for it.

10:28.830 --> 10:31.910
If anyone deserves to be happy, Clark,
it's you.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.720
I thought I'd see you at the party.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.510
I know.

10:49.640 --> 10:52.430
But then there'd be all those people.

10:55.390 --> 10:57.230
Do I look different to you now?

11:00.820 --> 11:04.780
Clark, you look like the same
handsome guy I've always known.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.910
Handsome as in,
"I want to spend my life with you"?

11:09.660 --> 11:12.700
Or handsome as,
"I'm gonna let you down easy"?

11:13.870 --> 11:19.290
As in, "Yes, Clark, I'll marry you."

11:49.820 --> 11:52.780
- Can you fix this necklace?
- Thanks. Let me get this for you.

11:52.910 --> 11:56.120
One more district and you'll have
a new commute to Topeka.

11:56.250 --> 12:00.420
Whatever the outcome, sweetheart,
the only victory that's changed my life...

12:00.540 --> 12:02.460
was when I won your heart.

12:04.090 --> 12:07.970
Mr. Kent. Mr. Kent, sir, this way.
Man of the hour, Jonathan Kent.

12:08.420 --> 12:10.430
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.310
Mom, Dad...

12:15.430 --> 12:16.930
Mr. And Mrs. Kent...

12:17.060 --> 12:20.770
I know that this is as much
a surprise for you as it is for me.

12:20.940 --> 12:24.610
Lana, we couldn't imagine Clark
spending his life with anyone but you.

12:24.730 --> 12:27.490
We hope that you have
as many happy years as we have.

12:27.610 --> 12:29.820
- Thank you.
- Let me see this.

12:29.950 --> 12:33.660
- Everyone. Everyone.
- Ah, it's beautiful.

12:35.700 --> 12:38.370
I just got the heads-up
from the newsroom.

12:38.500 --> 12:43.710
And, ladies and gentlemen,
you are looking at our new senator.

12:45.340 --> 12:48.880
We can call the tightly contested
Lowell County Senate race.

12:49.010 --> 12:51.550
Jonathan Kent's been
elected to the Kansas Senate...

12:51.840 --> 12:54.640
in a staggering upset over
corporate mogul, Lex Luthor.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.260
All right.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.940
Okay, Mr. Kent, I need to wrangle
you guys over here for a photo shoot.

13:02.060 --> 13:03.480
All right.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.190
- Excuse me.
- Mr. Kent.

13:06.320 --> 13:09.940
Oh, hey, oh, thank you, thank you.
Looks like the congratulations...

13:10.070 --> 13:11.570
are already coming in.

13:11.700 --> 13:13.820
I'll be with you in just a second.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.490
This could take a while.

13:17.660 --> 13:19.330
Is this really happening?

13:20.200 --> 13:22.620
Go do your photo op.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.320
You okay?

13:49.440 --> 13:53.150
You sounded pretty upset
in your message.

13:53.950 --> 13:56.200
I probably shouldn't have called.

13:57.120 --> 14:02.330
I shouldn't do a lot of things,
but I seem to do them anyway.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.590
I'm sure you want to get back
to the party. So...

14:11.760 --> 14:13.380
Lex.

14:14.090 --> 14:16.430
I know how hard you worked for this...

14:16.550 --> 14:20.060
"but" I don't think you should
take it so personally.

14:20.520 --> 14:23.640
You know how many people
are cheering right now...

14:23.770 --> 14:28.480
that the spoiled, rich kid lost
to some salt-of-the-earth farmer?

14:28.770 --> 14:32.070
Well, since when do you care
about what other people think?

14:32.610 --> 14:36.030
Since I was branded at birth
with the sins of my father.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.370
Just once, Lana...

14:42.700 --> 14:46.290
I wanted to get out from under
his shadow, you know?

14:47.170 --> 14:49.380
Earn something on my own.

14:51.750 --> 14:55.970
Well, consider yourself lucky
you never had a father to endure, huh.

15:01.510 --> 15:05.270
I think it's best if we talk about this
when you're not drunk.

15:06.190 --> 15:07.560
See...

15:08.480 --> 15:10.400
Now I've hurt your feelings.

15:12.230 --> 15:14.030
Perfect.

15:14.490 --> 15:16.030
Through this whole campaign...

15:16.150 --> 15:18.780
"I've" managed to alienate
everyone I care about.

15:19.950 --> 15:22.540
I can't lose you too.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.540
Lex.

15:28.250 --> 15:29.670
Hey.

15:30.380 --> 15:32.300
You aren't going to lose me.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.990
Well, I guess it's a bigger day
than I thought.

16:00.110 --> 16:02.530
Yeah. You know, it happened so fast.

16:02.660 --> 16:05.450
We never really got a chance
to tell anyone about it.

16:05.620 --> 16:07.160
Yeah.

16:08.210 --> 16:12.750
So after all the lies he told you,
you still chose him.

16:15.210 --> 16:19.090
- You don't understand.
- How many times have you come to me...

16:20.010 --> 16:22.550
wondering what Clark's
keeping from you.

16:23.640 --> 16:29.520
Why he disappeared to Metropolis
for months.

16:29.890 --> 16:32.360
How he rose from the dead.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.770
It's not like that now.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.780
Really?

16:40.030 --> 16:41.820
Come on.

16:41.950 --> 16:43.700
Lana.

16:43.910 --> 16:45.790
I know you.

16:48.540 --> 16:51.670
You'd never say yes
with all the doubts you have.

17:01.760 --> 17:05.640
Whatever it is he's been covering up
all this time...

17:08.140 --> 17:10.430
You know, don't you?

17:15.150 --> 17:18.109
Clark isn't hiding anything, Lex.

17:25.490 --> 17:28.950
After everything I've done for you...

17:30.080 --> 17:32.500
how could you lie to me?

17:37.420 --> 17:39.670
Tell me!

17:49.310 --> 17:50.980
Lana, where'd you go?

17:52.640 --> 17:55.610
Clark, I'm so sorry.
I went to see Lex.

17:55.730 --> 17:57.190
And he was really drunk.

17:57.570 --> 17:59.150
What happened?

18:00.070 --> 18:02.780
He knows.
I don't know how he could tell...

18:02.900 --> 18:05.570
but he could tell
I was hiding your secret.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.830
I didn't say anything to him.

18:07.950 --> 18:10.870
- But he got really angry.
- Lana, that's okay.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.830
Where are you now?

18:13.580 --> 18:16.540
I'm on Route 40,
right before Loeb Bridge.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.760
Oh, God.

18:24.880 --> 18:27.470
- Oh, God, he's coming after me.
- Lana.

18:31.470 --> 18:33.600
Lana! Lana!

18:33.730 --> 18:35.310
Just pull over so we can talk.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.060
Lana, watch out!

18:48.530 --> 18:51.700
No, no. Lana!

19:07.300 --> 19:09.300
Hurry, George.

19:20.900 --> 19:23.190
- Come here, come on. Clark.
- Lana!

19:23.320 --> 19:24.900
- Come here. Come on.
- Lana!

19:25.030 --> 19:26.530
- No!
- Lana!

19:26.650 --> 19:28.110
No!

19:32.620 --> 19:35.660
There's nothing you could've done.

19:35.790 --> 19:37.620
Nothing.

19:46.260 --> 19:48.800
How could you take her away from me?

19:49.180 --> 19:52.220
Human life is fragile, my son.

19:52.350 --> 19:55.390
You knew a life would be exchanged
for yours.

19:55.520 --> 19:58.020
Don't make her pay for my mistake.

19:58.600 --> 20:02.940
If I hadn't told her the truth about me,
she'd still be alive!

20:05.860 --> 20:07.610
You have to let me fix it.

20:07.740 --> 20:11.200
Your powers on Earth
may seem extraordinary, Kal-El.

20:11.320 --> 20:13.780
But we are not gods.

20:15.290 --> 20:17.960
This is not her destiny!

20:18.080 --> 20:20.370
And you know that!

20:23.590 --> 20:26.210
There has to be a way.

20:26.800 --> 20:30.340
There has to be a way to...
To fix this.

20:30.470 --> 20:32.720
- Please.
- There is one trial...

20:32.850 --> 20:34.850
you have yet to experience.

20:34.970 --> 20:37.310
But you must heed my warning.

20:37.430 --> 20:40.520
The tide of fate is impossible to stop.

20:40.640 --> 20:44.440
Even if you are able to alter
one course of events...

20:44.570 --> 20:47.740
the universe will find a balance.

20:47.860 --> 20:50.490
There is only one crystal.

20:50.610 --> 20:54.490
Once you make this choice,
there is no second chance.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.240
Decide carefully.

20:57.370 --> 20:59.620
I have to save her.

21:13.180 --> 21:16.850
I brought gloves and a scarf,
like you said.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.600
You're here.

21:26.190 --> 21:28.860
Of course I'm here, Clark.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.950
I'm just not sure a mystery date's...

21:36.080 --> 21:38.910
exactly what our relationship needs
right now.

21:41.620 --> 21:45.630
So where are you taking me?

21:50.880 --> 21:53.680
I just thought
we could spend the day together.

21:54.550 --> 21:56.550
That part, I kind of figured.

21:56.680 --> 22:00.020
But it was the quote,
"day that I'll never forget" ""

22:00.140 --> 22:02.600
that I was a little curious about.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.400
Right.

22:07.150 --> 22:08.570
Well...

22:10.230 --> 22:12.610
I thought we could go for a drive.

22:12.990 --> 22:15.410
Maybe up to the lake. And...

22:16.530 --> 22:20.540
But you know, with this...
This cold snap we're having...

22:20.660 --> 22:24.620
the bridges are probably iced over.
So we should just stay here.

22:27.290 --> 22:30.340
Don't you think I know by now
when you're lying?

22:34.930 --> 22:38.890
Just... Just say something.
Anything.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.560
You know, it wasn't a big deal.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.480
Really, I mean...

22:45.390 --> 22:47.860
- Trust me. It was...
- Clark.

22:48.270 --> 22:50.610
You know that it goes both ways.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.280
- Lana, I...
- Don't.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.660
Unless it's the truth.

23:07.580 --> 23:10.750
Clark, as much as I love you,
I can't do this anymore.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.340
Lana, you don't understand.

23:13.460 --> 23:16.470
- If anything ever happened to you...
- Like what?

23:17.840 --> 23:21.600
What could be worse than losing
the person that you love?

23:25.560 --> 23:27.270
Nothing.

23:37.280 --> 23:39.280
I need a break.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.000
From me?

23:49.420 --> 23:51.000
No.

23:51.670 --> 23:53.340
From us.

24:14.190 --> 24:15.860
She's really done this time.

24:15.990 --> 24:17.950
Done-done?
Or just on a downward slope...

24:18.070 --> 24:21.160
of the perpetual
Lana-Clark roller coaster?

24:21.910 --> 24:23.490
Really?

24:23.620 --> 24:27.040
- What happened?
- Ready to put on your Wall of Weird hat?

24:28.460 --> 24:29.870
I've lived this day before.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.630
I kind of went back in time.

24:31.750 --> 24:35.460
Right. What'd you do,
spin the Earth backwards on its axis?

24:35.590 --> 24:37.880
You didn't pick up the lottery numbers...

24:38.010 --> 24:39.720
while you were at it, did you?

24:39.840 --> 24:41.800
You see these flowers?

24:42.430 --> 24:44.760
- They're going to this secretary.
- Margaret?

24:44.890 --> 24:48.270
She's a workaholic.
She hasn't had a date in like a year.

24:50.190 --> 24:52.560
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

24:53.690 --> 24:55.860
And your boss, he's firing someone
right now.

24:55.980 --> 24:57.780
Within the hour! You're fired!

24:57.900 --> 25:00.570
You can't fire me! I quit!

25:04.240 --> 25:05.990
Don't bother. It's a wrong number.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.040
Chinese takeout.

25:09.120 --> 25:10.750
Hello?

25:11.870 --> 25:15.460
No, I'm sorry,
we're all out of egg rolls.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.840
All right, McFly,
do you wanna start with how or why?

25:23.970 --> 25:25.350
Jor-El.

25:25.470 --> 25:27.600
I went to him
to try to change things back.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.430
Back to what?

25:30.310 --> 25:33.310
The first time around,
I told Lana the truth about me.

25:35.520 --> 25:36.940
And I asked her to marry me.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.280
What?

25:39.400 --> 25:42.610
What...? What...? What did she say?

25:42.780 --> 25:44.200
Yes.

25:44.660 --> 25:46.620
Oh, my God.

25:46.740 --> 25:48.200
What...?

25:48.330 --> 25:50.330
Well, what was my reaction?

25:51.370 --> 25:53.170
A lot like that.

25:53.290 --> 25:54.960
But listen, it was a big mistake.

25:55.080 --> 25:58.130
- Lex was chasing her on Route 40 and...
- Clark.

25:59.170 --> 26:01.590
There was an accident.
I didn't get there in time.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.760
- Why was Lex chasing Lana?
- He figured out she knew my secret.

26:04.890 --> 26:08.310
- It's why I've been afraid to tell her.
- This time you can warn her.

26:08.430 --> 26:10.560
This doesn't mean you have to lie to her.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.520
Chloe, she knew for less than a day.

26:12.640 --> 26:15.230
Someone's always gonna be
trying to find out about me.

26:15.350 --> 26:17.860
As long as we're together,
they'll be watching her.

26:17.980 --> 26:20.570
Don't worry, Clark.
We won't let her near that road.

26:20.690 --> 26:22.530
What time is this supposed to happen?

26:22.650 --> 26:25.240
11:02. Problem is,
she's not talking to me.

26:25.700 --> 26:27.870
You could stay with her
and make sure that...

26:27.990 --> 26:31.250
Fate doesn't get a second chance?
I won't leave her side.

26:40.300 --> 26:43.090
Man of the hour, Jonathan Kent.

26:46.180 --> 26:49.350
- Everything all right, Clark?
- Yeah, everything's great.

26:50.720 --> 26:53.520
- Good luck tonight, Dad.
- Thank you.

27:01.730 --> 27:04.280
Hey, you made it.

27:09.030 --> 27:10.410
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:10.530 --> 27:12.740
- How's everything?
- Good. I haven't left her.

27:12.870 --> 27:15.080
Tightly contested
Lowell County Senate race.

27:15.210 --> 27:18.210
Jonathan Kent has just been elected...

27:22.710 --> 27:25.590
- Wait, something's not the same.
- Senator.

27:25.720 --> 27:27.550
Lois?

27:31.430 --> 27:33.180
Lois!

27:33.390 --> 27:35.020
Lois.

27:43.860 --> 27:46.820
Lana? Lana?

27:49.450 --> 27:51.240
Yeah. Hello.

27:51.370 --> 27:54.790
I wanted to be the first
to congratulate you, senator.

27:55.750 --> 27:58.420
There are a few things
I'd like to discuss with you...

27:58.540 --> 28:00.580
"now" that we've won.

28:16.890 --> 28:18.270
You okay?

28:18.390 --> 28:22.020
You sounded pretty
upset in your message.

28:22.900 --> 28:25.110
I probably shouldn't have called.

28:26.030 --> 28:31.280
I shouldn't do a lot of things,
but I seem to do them anyway.

28:36.290 --> 28:39.580
I'm sure you want to get back
to the party. So...

28:42.670 --> 28:47.050
I was kind of looking for a reason
to get some air.

28:49.510 --> 28:52.300
Clark and I had our last fight.

29:08.530 --> 29:10.530
Last, huh?

29:14.070 --> 29:19.290
I kept waiting for that armor
to crack, but...

29:19.710 --> 29:24.330
I thought that if I was patient enough,
he would finally let me in.

29:25.170 --> 29:28.920
But I guess people
have armor for a reason.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.050
Lana.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.900
I hate to say this...

29:48.690 --> 29:52.450
"but" it's possible
Clark's never going to trust you.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.450
I don't understand.

29:59.540 --> 30:02.120
Why would you lie
to someone you love?

30:16.600 --> 30:18.470
I wouldn't.

30:34.910 --> 30:38.160
- Wow, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...
- It's okay. It's okay.

30:38.280 --> 30:41.040
- I'm just gonna... I'm gonna go.
- I...

31:18.120 --> 31:20.080
- Let's go.
- Do I really need an audience?

31:20.200 --> 31:23.700
Back to the party. There's lots
of chocolate cake, nine cases of Merlot.

31:23.830 --> 31:26.080
You were out.
Have someone take a look at you.

31:26.210 --> 31:30.040
Do you need to haul me to HMO-land
for committing a serious party foul?

31:30.170 --> 31:31.670
Clark.

31:31.800 --> 31:34.970
Clark, I've looked everywhere,
and I can't find Lana.

31:41.180 --> 31:43.680
Lana. Listen, I'm... I'm sorry.

31:43.810 --> 31:45.890
Can we talk about this?

31:50.900 --> 31:52.360
I'm not gonna tell you again.

31:55.190 --> 31:57.030
Watch out!

32:15.670 --> 32:17.300
Lana.

32:21.970 --> 32:25.770
- Lana.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

32:25.890 --> 32:27.810
I'm sorry.

32:28.810 --> 32:32.730
I didn't mean what happened back there.
I was just coming to apologize and...

32:32.860 --> 32:36.490
Lex, let's just forget it ever happened,
all right?

32:47.200 --> 32:50.000
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

32:58.420 --> 33:01.930
Senator Jonathan Kent.

33:02.840 --> 33:06.390
And I didn't expect you
to duck out of your victory party tonight.

33:06.520 --> 33:08.140
But I'm here.

33:08.270 --> 33:10.390
And I'm alone, as you requested.

33:10.520 --> 33:11.940
Good.

33:12.060 --> 33:15.150
So why don't you come down here
and face me, you son of a bitch.

33:17.610 --> 33:21.700
Perhaps a few lessons in tact, senator.

33:21.820 --> 33:24.530
Now that you're gonna be
in the public eye.

33:24.660 --> 33:26.620
Why don't you just cut the crap, Luthor?

33:26.740 --> 33:28.910
I know my campaign accepted funds
from you.

33:29.040 --> 33:32.670
But I also know I'm gonna pay them
all back. I won't owe you a thing.

33:32.790 --> 33:36.380
I wonder how far that virtuous
stance will get you once you're in office.

33:36.500 --> 33:40.130
I just wanna make sure you understand.
You don't have a puppet, here.

33:40.260 --> 33:43.840
I should hope not. I didn't put
my financial and political clout...

33:43.970 --> 33:48.060
behind a candidate
who would be anyone's puppet.

33:48.560 --> 33:53.310
I envision this rather as a partnership.

33:53.440 --> 33:55.230
The day you and I become partners...

33:55.360 --> 33:58.230
- will be the day...
- Careful. Careful. Careful, senator.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.530
Don't forget, you and I...

34:00.650 --> 34:04.660
have a common interest.

34:04.780 --> 34:09.580
One that both of us would...

34:09.699 --> 34:11.790
protect with our lives.

34:12.620 --> 34:14.540
I have nothing but respect for a man...

34:14.670 --> 34:17.540
who would deliberately
hurl himself into the spotlight...

34:17.670 --> 34:19.500
with such a...

34:20.550 --> 34:25.219
dangerous secret
that must stay hidden.

34:37.860 --> 34:41.230
I won't let you destroy my family.

34:50.659 --> 34:53.659
We can withstand anything
you bring down on us...

34:53.790 --> 34:55.290
because we have each other.

34:55.790 --> 34:59.460
That's what will always separate
the Kents from the Luthors.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.920
Now, why don't you get...

35:06.760 --> 35:09.890
Now, why don't you
get the hell off my property.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.800
What's your dad doing out here?

35:47.300 --> 35:49.390
What?

35:53.310 --> 35:54.980
Dad?

35:55.730 --> 35:57.480
Jonathan? Jonathan!

35:57.600 --> 35:59.980
- Dad? Dad!
- Jonathan!

36:00.110 --> 36:02.820
Dad? Just set him down over here.
Come on, Dad.

36:02.940 --> 36:05.650
Come on. Here, just sit down.

36:13.990 --> 36:16.200
No, Jonathan!

36:16.330 --> 36:18.290
- Dad!
- Oh, God! Jonathan!

36:18.420 --> 36:20.380
- Dad!
- Jonathan!

36:20.500 --> 36:21.920
Dad?

36:22.040 --> 36:24.920
No! Oh, please, not yet!

36:25.050 --> 36:27.470
- No! Jonathan.
- Dad.

36:29.090 --> 36:31.550
No, Jonathan!

36:59.160 --> 37:01.540
I guess it's time, then.

37:04.630 --> 37:06.550
I'm sorry.

37:14.100 --> 37:15.850
Sit down.

37:21.390 --> 37:22.940
Clark.

37:23.480 --> 37:27.610
I know you're blaming yourself,
but this was not your fault.

37:28.900 --> 37:31.200
How can you say that?

37:32.450 --> 37:35.240
I went back to save Lana...

37:36.740 --> 37:39.120
"and" now Dad's gone.

37:40.540 --> 37:42.960
Do you think
you could have chosen between them...

37:43.080 --> 37:45.130
"if" you'd had the chance?

37:48.550 --> 37:50.300
Clark...

37:51.380 --> 37:55.430
A heart beats only so many times
in a life.

37:57.140 --> 38:00.930
Your father used his
more than anyone I know.

38:09.320 --> 38:12.950
I just don't know how I'm supposed
to be the man he wanted me to be...

38:13.070 --> 38:15.070
without him here.

38:19.240 --> 38:21.330
You're his son.

38:22.580 --> 38:25.330
You know what's right and wrong.

38:26.840 --> 38:30.300
Whether your father is here with us
or not...

38:32.260 --> 38:35.260
you're a man he's proud of.

38:37.180 --> 38:39.810
A man he could look up to.

38:41.390 --> 38:44.810
And something tells me
he won't be the only one.

39:00.660 --> 39:02.250
Can I help you with this?

39:27.980 --> 39:30.110
I love you, Mom.

39:32.820 --> 39:34.860
I love you too.
