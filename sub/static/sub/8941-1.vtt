01:51.027 --> 01:53.238
I see some ladies up there
who wanna love me sexy.

01:53.321 --> 01:56.199
Jackie Moon soaking up
a robust round of applause...

01:56.282 --> 02:00.495
as he finishes up his
once-popular song Love Me Sexy.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.372
I'm Dick Pepperfield, joined
as always...

02:02.455 --> 02:05.208
by former Tropics forward
Lou Redwood.

02:05.291 --> 02:07.335
Yeah I might suit up tonight.

02:07.418 --> 02:09.711
Sometimes I still dream of glory Dick.

02:09.795 --> 02:13.174
Well, sometimes dreams
can turn into nightmares, Lou.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.300
What's your problem?

02:15.343 --> 02:17.470
And now the starting lineup...

02:17.554 --> 02:22.350
for your Flint Michigan Tropics!

02:22.433 --> 02:28.231
At Ball Girl measuring 34-23-34...

02:28.314 --> 02:30.066
she hopes to be
an astronaut one day...

02:30.150 --> 02:31.901
I don't think she can do it.

02:31.985 --> 02:36.573
Put your hands together for Melinda!

02:36.656 --> 02:39.117
Go Tropics!

02:39.200 --> 02:40.577
From South Bend Indiana...

02:40.660 --> 02:44.372
this guy has a heart of gold
his brother's a retard.

02:44.455 --> 02:47.584
He reads to him
and paints him pretty pictures...

02:47.667 --> 02:50.420
Scootsie Doubleday!

02:50.503 --> 02:52.714
Scootsie Doubleday
taking the court now.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.591
Yeah his brother
is really retarded.

02:54.674 --> 02:55.592
Ronnie Doubleday.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.469
He has all three
major kinds of retardation.

02:58.553 --> 03:02.223
This guy is single and
disease-free no V.D. at all...

03:02.307 --> 03:05.268
but you could be the lucky girl
to give it to him!

03:05.351 --> 03:06.728
Six foot five!

03:06.811 --> 03:09.189
Twiggy Munson!

03:09.272 --> 03:10.440
Of course he's disease-free.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.334
What chick wants to be with a guy
that's hung like a twig?

03:12.358 --> 03:14.253
Well that's not true.
I've heard a lot of women say...

03:14.277 --> 03:15.671
that they actually prefer a small penis.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.323
Show me one gal who says that
and I'll show you a liar.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.867
I'll introduce you to
Mrs. Pepperfield later on tonight.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.160
Oh Jesus here we go.

03:22.243 --> 03:23.411
Your man in the middle...

03:23.494 --> 03:24.704
seven foot two...

03:24.787 --> 03:27.624
from a weird country called Lithuania.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.792
He's ugly as shit.

03:29.876 --> 03:34.631
- Vakidis!
- Go daddy!

03:34.714 --> 03:35.914
- This fella scares me.
- Yeah!

03:35.965 --> 03:38.426
That little kid from the Jackson Five
he scares ya too.

03:38.509 --> 03:39.928
Oh mark my words Lou...

03:40.011 --> 03:42.138
there's something creepy
about that young man.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.806
Bobby Dee where's Clarence?

03:43.890 --> 03:45.534
- Nobody's heard from him.
- Come on Tropics!

03:45.558 --> 03:46.851
Bee Bee!

03:46.935 --> 03:48.186
You're startin'.

03:48.269 --> 03:50.480
From Peoria Illinois...

03:50.563 --> 03:51.940
this guy
what can I say about him?

03:52.023 --> 03:54.984
He's got the hottest girl in the world
I'm not kiddin'.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.029
Cannons people. Big ol' boobies.

03:58.112 --> 04:03.952
The luckiest man in Flint...
Bee Bee Ellis!

04:04.035 --> 04:05.804
Well, it's true about
what they say about Bee Bee's wife.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.914
She has got a tremendous set of boobs.

04:07.997 --> 04:09.374
To me they're too large.

04:09.457 --> 04:10.875
Oh they're perfect.

04:10.959 --> 04:14.379
I don't know they... To me
she looks structurally unsound.

04:14.462 --> 04:17.548
And now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

04:17.632 --> 04:22.220
At six foot five
a solid meaty 215 pounds...

04:22.303 --> 04:25.515
your pregame announcer,
your owner, your coach...

04:25.598 --> 04:28.643
your pop-singing sensation,
but most importantly...

04:28.726 --> 04:30.019
your power forward...

04:30.103 --> 04:36.025
yours truly, Jackie Moon!

04:36.109 --> 04:37.360
All right!

04:37.443 --> 04:39.237
Jackie Moon
always gives himself...

04:39.320 --> 04:41.239
a fantastic introduction.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.633
- Yeah, why not, Dick?
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

04:42.657 --> 04:45.702
It's his team, his money and
his tunnel of beautiful ball girls.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.788
Oh speaking of money Lou
did you get paid this week?

04:48.871 --> 04:49.871
No.

04:49.914 --> 04:51.541
You lose weight Father Pat?

04:51.624 --> 04:52.624
Fuck off Jackie.

04:52.667 --> 04:56.504
All right guys huddle up.
Vakidis!

04:56.587 --> 04:58.673
What is he doin'?
You know what? Fuck it.

04:58.756 --> 05:01.134
Listen I promised these fans
a show tonight all right?

05:01.217 --> 05:03.779
Twiggy, if you get a dunk tonight
try to break that backboard all right?

05:03.803 --> 05:05.443
- We'll get that on the news.
- All right.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.724
Let's bring it in,
it's showtime right? Let's get...

05:07.807 --> 05:09.309
Tropical!

05:09.392 --> 05:11.853
Go Tropics!

05:12.562 --> 05:14.230
Right here right here right here!

05:14.314 --> 05:16.024
I don't like it.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.317
Back! Back!

05:17.400 --> 05:19.777
Clear!
Yep that feels good. That feels...

05:19.861 --> 05:22.655
- Danny what are ya doin'?
- Nothin'. Eatin' nachos.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.133
You get 'em from the concession stand?

05:24.157 --> 05:26.743
- Nah I brought 'em from home.
- What? Uh-uh.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.286
No no no no no.

05:28.369 --> 05:29.746
Oh come on!

05:29.829 --> 05:30.955
- What?
- Travel!

05:31.039 --> 05:33.183
He brought nachos from home.
Tryin' to run a business here.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.144
- You can't call that.
- Jackie you gotta dribble...

05:35.168 --> 05:36.085
if you're gonna move.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.420
What are you talkin' about?

05:37.503 --> 05:39.297
- Basketball rules.
- Fine.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.758
I got season tickets.
I can do whatever the hell I want.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.509
Oh yeah?
Well I can do this.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.762
And this.

05:45.845 --> 05:49.015
And that!

05:49.098 --> 05:50.683
Let's go Trops!

05:51.893 --> 05:54.354
We are well underway
and the big question Lou...

05:54.437 --> 05:58.107
Where is Tropics' leading scorer
Clarence "Downtown" Malone?

05:58.191 --> 06:00.318
I agree it's completely
unprofessional, Dick.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.379
Lou, can I ask you
to please put out your cigarette?

06:02.403 --> 06:04.489
No I like to smoke when I drink.

06:04.572 --> 06:07.367
Hey so don't get all lonely
on me now, people.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.744
Come on down to Pet Galaxy.

06:09.827 --> 06:10.953
Whoo!

06:12.121 --> 06:13.706
So you make sure you tell 'em...

06:13.790 --> 06:15.792
Sweet Sugar Dunkerton sent ya.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.585
Hey! I'm open.

06:17.668 --> 06:18.961
Whoo!

06:22.507 --> 06:24.967
Gentlemen what can I get for you?

06:25.051 --> 06:26.803
Hey wasn't that just you?

06:26.886 --> 06:28.486
- There on TV?
- You like that don't you?

06:28.513 --> 06:29.513
That's cool huh?

06:29.555 --> 06:32.433
Hey the TV say your name was
Sugar Dunkinton.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.811
How come your nametag don't say that?

06:34.894 --> 06:36.312
'Cause I changed it.

06:36.396 --> 06:40.483
"Downtown Funky Stuff" Malone.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.778
- Clarence!
- "Downtown".

06:43.861 --> 06:46.531
I ain't never named
no son of mine no "Downtown".

06:46.614 --> 06:48.908
Well you know what?
I can't hear a damn thing you sayin'.

06:48.991 --> 06:51.369
Mm-hm. Every hear of a clock? It's 7:15.

06:51.452 --> 06:52.620
Shit!

07:05.383 --> 07:08.469
OK Tropics fans
it's time to guess today's attendance.

07:08.553 --> 07:12.014
Is it A, 7254...

07:12.098 --> 07:14.767
- B, 8,506...
- Go inside!

07:14.851 --> 07:17.437
Or C, 91?

07:17.520 --> 07:18.896
Oh!

07:18.980 --> 07:21.816
Look at that an easy lay-up there
for the Nets. That's two points.

07:21.899 --> 07:24.318
I'm thinking of getting
one of these Jap cars like a Datsun.

07:24.402 --> 07:27.280
Yeah. Put away the classifieds
please, Lou, and let's focus.

07:27.363 --> 07:34.036
All right, fans, let's hear it for
"Downtown Funky Stuff" Malone!

07:34.120 --> 07:35.639
Father Pat that guy's gotta
check in the game all right?

07:35.663 --> 07:36.663
I got it I got it.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.542
Downtown wastes no time
tagging out Bee Bee Ellis...

07:39.625 --> 07:41.544
and Munson passes him the ball
immediately.

07:41.627 --> 07:44.523
Downtown dribbles the ball through
his legs... I love it when he does that.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.549
He's making mincemeat
of his defender here.

07:46.632 --> 07:50.303
Downtown! If you want it!
If you... Only if you want it!

07:50.386 --> 07:52.555
You don't want it I can feel it.
You don't want it OK.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.724
That's right Nets.

07:54.807 --> 07:57.727
You're not gonna stop it.
Believe me we don't stop it in practice.

07:57.810 --> 07:58.871
- Let's do it!
- Come on come on come on!

07:58.895 --> 08:00.480
- Go!
- You got it.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.732
He tosses a three...

08:02.815 --> 08:04.150
- And yes! Ha ha ha!
- Whoo!

08:04.233 --> 08:06.235
- Wow! That was quite a shot.
- Pounce!

08:06.319 --> 08:08.237
- Oh man!
- Yeah!

08:11.657 --> 08:13.910
At halftime it's the Nets 62...

08:13.993 --> 08:15.661
Flint Tropics 43.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.372
All right, everybody,
let's hear it for Tropical time...

08:18.456 --> 08:20.583
and let's hear it for Busch Bavarian.

08:21.918 --> 08:26.339
If you're gonna drink a beer, you
might as well make it Busch Bavarian.

08:26.422 --> 08:29.091
Ladies and gentlemen
I want you to welcome this man...

08:29.175 --> 08:34.096
who's gonna attempt the impossible...
The $10,000 free throw...

08:34.179 --> 08:36.432
from the other side of the court.
The Moon shot.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.392
- Right on. Ha.
- All right. Tell everybody...

08:38.476 --> 08:40.770
- what's your name?
- Dukes. Ha ha.

08:40.852 --> 08:42.355
- All right Dukes.
- Dukes!

08:42.438 --> 08:44.440
- Dukes where ya from?
- Flint, Michigan...

08:44.524 --> 08:45.816
and I never missed a game!

08:45.900 --> 08:47.693
- Whoo!
- Go!

08:47.777 --> 08:49.445
Dukes is homegrown.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.007
I think you're on a little somethin'
that's homegrown maybe, huh?

08:52.031 --> 08:54.575
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha. We're havin' fun.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.019
Dukes what do you do for a livin'?

08:56.077 --> 08:58.246
Um...

08:58.329 --> 08:59.329
nothin' right now.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.874
Layin' low. Playin' it right.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.269
What are you gonna do with all that money
if you win? Maybe buy a shirt?

09:04.293 --> 09:06.546
Ha ha. Yeah man a shirt. Ha ha!

09:06.629 --> 09:08.339
- Whoo!
- Dukes is excited!

09:08.422 --> 09:09.632
So am I.

09:09.715 --> 09:12.593
Come on let's go people.
Let's get it goin'.

09:12.677 --> 09:16.806
Cheer this guy on
as he prepares for the impossible.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.308
Well, we've got
an especially dirty hippie here...

09:19.392 --> 09:21.477
down on the court tryin' to sink
an impossible shot.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.980
This is human drama at its best.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.483
He's just focusing taking a moment
to concentrate. That's OK.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.569
Concentrate all you want.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.282
- Come on Dukes!
- All right.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.534
- Unh!
- Ohhhh...

09:36.617 --> 09:38.035
- No!
- Yes!

09:38.119 --> 09:39.996
Holy shit I'm a miracle!

09:40.079 --> 09:41.831
Whoo!

09:43.040 --> 09:44.333
Yeah!

09:44.417 --> 09:46.502
Father Pat he stepped on the line.
He stepped on it.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.604
- No no it was legal.
- No, no...

09:47.628 --> 09:48.897
he stepped on the line
You were lookin' at it. Come on.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.131
Jackie he made the shot.

09:50.214 --> 09:52.133
Who the hell has $10000?

13:03.365 --> 13:07.077
Are you crazy?
I just got back from an orgy.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.788
Some guy named Steve's house.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.915
I'm exhausted.

13:10.998 --> 13:14.376
I mean my wiener said to me
"Jackie, I've had enough...

I can't go back to working

13:27.389 --> 13:29.868

13:29.892 --> 13:32.228
"Downtown Funky Stuff" Malone

13:32.311 --> 13:35.898
I dig you, brother, but I heard
the problem ain't just here in Flint.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.900
It's the whole league that's goin' under.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.610

14:12.726 --> 14:13.936

14:14.019 --> 14:18.524

14:24.905 --> 14:26.907

14:30.870 --> 14:32.389

as Bambi's mother.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.623
I make sure nothing
bad'll happen to you.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.458
Drink up this is a big night.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.918
- Hey drinks on me.
- Big night.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.002
Whoo!

14:39.044 --> 14:42.548
Bambi's mother got shot right?

14:42.631 --> 14:44.592
Yeah first scene.

14:44.675 --> 14:48.178
I remember that the credits
were still rollin' and everything.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.641
Who the fuck is Bambi?

15:05.321 --> 15:07.323
Merger. Merger.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.449
M... M... M... Merger.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.075
Jackie Moon. Jackie Moon.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.285
America.

15:11.368 --> 15:14.496
Let's go. Let's do this.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.665
Don't worry, Mom,
I won't let you down.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.584
I'll keep this team alive.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.253
Whew.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.925
And our TV stations are complaining
about all the fighting.

15:26.008 --> 15:30.429
Let's try to keep the fights in the tunnel
or out in the parking lot.

15:30.512 --> 15:33.557
Uh we have one more
piece of business to go over.

15:33.641 --> 15:37.269
I'm sure you've all heard the rumors
and they are true...

15:37.353 --> 15:39.730
the ABA will be merging
with the NBA...

15:39.813 --> 15:41.899
at the end of this season.

15:41.982 --> 15:45.736
Yes. Yes.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.615
I did it.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.116
I'm a real owner.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.495
- Please Jackie let go.
- I did it.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.038
All right let's...

15:56.121 --> 15:57.456
not get too excited.

15:57.539 --> 15:59.708
Yes!
Give me ten Norton!

15:59.792 --> 16:01.460
Everyone can eat shit!

16:01.543 --> 16:04.672
A big bag of shit! Ha ha ha!

16:04.755 --> 16:07.257
I'm the greatest man in the world!

16:07.341 --> 16:08.801
Whoo!

16:08.884 --> 16:11.512
The NBA has agreed
to our financial demands...

16:11.595 --> 16:13.198
- but there is something else...
- You were right Mom.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.264
Destiny.

16:14.348 --> 16:17.893
Oh, I'm so happy
I can't even feel my arms!

16:17.977 --> 16:19.853
- Ha ha ha!
- OK Jackie listen to me. Jackie?

16:19.937 --> 16:21.647
- Hey Jackie?
- Yes?

16:21.730 --> 16:25.484
Four teams will be absorbed
into the NBA next year.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.487
The rest of the league
will terminate operations.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.030
Exactly. You know it.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.866
Wait.
Wait what did you say?

16:32.950 --> 16:36.245
The Nets, the Spurs,
the Pacers and the Nuggets...

16:36.328 --> 16:38.080
are gonna play in the NBA next season.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.916
- The rest of us are gonna dissolve.
- Dissolve?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.751
What's "dissolve"? Ha.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.087
Is that even a word? Ha.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.297
Yes it is a word...

16:47.381 --> 16:49.883
and financially it means
you'll cease to exist.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.528
Let's don't get emotional about it.
Just...

16:51.552 --> 16:53.012
No!

16:54.179 --> 16:55.514
No!

16:55.597 --> 16:57.224
OK.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.307
All right you're being...

16:58.350 --> 16:59.577
- Ohh... ohh...
- Well Jackie. Jackie...

16:59.601 --> 17:01.979
You... Don't bite yourself.
Come on.

17:02.062 --> 17:05.357
Jackie we agreed to a very large sum.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.984
I don't want a large sum OK?

17:08.068 --> 17:10.738
I want my team.
Come on you guys...

17:10.820 --> 17:14.157
you're not gonna just sit there
and take the money are you? Huh?

17:15.867 --> 17:17.161
Ahem.

17:17.243 --> 17:19.329
What do the Nets have
that I don't have?!

17:19.413 --> 17:20.830
The Nets have a huge fan base.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.165
They got a brand-new stadium.

17:22.249 --> 17:25.085
Solid economic growth package
with great tax incentives.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.174
Oh come on Alan that's bullshit!

17:31.383 --> 17:33.385
The NBA's gonna
take four teams Jackie.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.762
This is a good deal.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.394
Best four teams should go.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.732
He's right.
The season isn't over yet.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.068
Hey, you know what? Yeah,
everybody should have a chance.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.319
That's the fairest way.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.488
Aw gee whiz...

17:52.571 --> 17:54.490
that sounds like so much fun...

17:54.573 --> 17:56.033
fair and all.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.826
But come on guys...

17:57.910 --> 18:00.037
I mean look at what
we're dealing with here.

18:00.120 --> 18:03.207
This guy plays power forward
for his own team, so...

18:03.290 --> 18:04.708
But he has a point.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.544
Why not make the terms of
a merger performance-based.

18:07.628 --> 18:08.628
- Exactly.
- Huh?

18:08.670 --> 18:09.750
- What he just said.
- Yeah.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.465
I move we vote
on the terms of the merger.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.318
- I second.
- And what he... what that guy said.

18:13.342 --> 18:14.736
But... What... What both those guys said.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.888
God damn it Bob! I'm about to reach
over there and tear you a new asshole!

18:17.971 --> 18:19.014
Don't be a jackass.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.034
- It makes sense.
- Fuck you Bob! We talked this out!

18:21.058 --> 18:22.619
I don't see a need
for that kinda language.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.228
Now if you wanna go outside
right now...

18:24.311 --> 18:26.980
I'll take both of you fuckers out
right damn now!

18:27.064 --> 18:28.500
We're not gonna fight
we're gonna vote!

18:28.524 --> 18:30.234
- Let's vote!
- Let's vote...

18:30.317 --> 18:31.568
and then we'll fight!

18:31.652 --> 18:31.692
Come on guys...

18:31.693 --> 18:33.570
Come on guys...

18:33.654 --> 18:35.531
you should be juiced right now.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.117
This is a chance to become
a real NBA franchise.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.451
Man get outta town.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.805
Ain't no way in Sam Hill
we gonna make it to fourth place.

18:41.829 --> 18:42.829
- Nope.
- Yeah Jackie...

18:42.871 --> 18:44.873
we have a horseshit record right now.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.793
Yeah well we just need to start
hittin' our threes OK?

18:47.876 --> 18:50.462
That's not the problem Jackie.
The problem is...

18:50.546 --> 18:51.922
we suck.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.592
Scootsie you did not deserve that.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.386
- I know.
- I apologize.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.264
Stop that shit man.

19:00.347 --> 19:03.517
We do not suck OK?

19:03.600 --> 19:06.061
I been doin' a lot of thinkin'.

19:06.145 --> 19:10.149
Decided to add someone to our team
to add some real firepower OK?

19:10.232 --> 19:12.609
I think this guy
could give us a new spark.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.319
Now don't get mad.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.947
- At point guard...
- At point guard?

19:17.030 --> 19:18.615
Five-ten...

19:18.699 --> 19:21.243
I traded away our
washing machine to get him.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.287
He punches in bunches.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.331
Ed Monix!

19:28.584 --> 19:31.044
Toilet's clogged.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.881
Hell no.
You traded for Monix?

19:33.964 --> 19:35.424
Yeah.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.259
This guy's an old warrior come on.

19:37.342 --> 19:38.385
Yeah he old.

19:38.468 --> 19:40.554
He can shoot the basketball.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.639
Most importantly,
he actually agreed to come here.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.349
So?

19:44.433 --> 19:49.897
It's a thrill to be in Flint.
Uh s... smells Tropical in here.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.524
Now, look, I know
just about everyone...

19:52.608 --> 19:55.088
in this locker room has been
punched in the face by this guy...

19:55.152 --> 19:56.278
at some point in time.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.572
And maybe even one of us has...

19:58.655 --> 20:02.201
had his collarbone broken... twice.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.410
Sorry Twig.

20:03.493 --> 20:04.953
Thanks Ed.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.289
Hey how are your mom and sister?

20:07.372 --> 20:09.958
It's been about 12 weeks
since I porked 'em.

20:10.042 --> 20:14.588
Let's not talk about porking
of the moms and the sisters...

20:14.671 --> 20:17.466
because we only have
one rule on this team.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.218
What is that rule Twiggy?

20:19.301 --> 20:20.302
E-L-E.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.054
That's right E-L-E.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.555
And what does "E-L-E" stand for?

20:23.639 --> 20:27.309
- "Everybody Love Everybody".
- "Everybody Love Everybody".

20:27.392 --> 20:28.852
Right there up on the wall.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.646
Got that Monix?

20:30.729 --> 20:32.064
- Nope.
- Great.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.358
'Cause this isn't just
a basketball team...

20:34.441 --> 20:36.902
this is a lifestyle.

20:36.985 --> 20:38.195
Welcome aboard Monix.

20:38.278 --> 20:39.529
Thank you.
Good to be here.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.406
All right.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.284
Oh if you see a possum...

20:44.368 --> 20:46.954
try to kill it OK?

20:47.037 --> 20:48.580
It's not a pet.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.755
Welcome back to Tropics Weekly.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.590
The ABA has announced...

20:58.674 --> 21:02.970
that the top four teams will merge
with the NBA after this season.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.072
Seizing the opportunity...

21:04.096 --> 21:08.433
owner/player/coach Jackie Moon
has already made the first move...

21:08.517 --> 21:11.019
acquiring Ed Monix
from the Kentucky Colonels.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.229
Yeah!

21:12.312 --> 21:13.897
I'm a pretty aggressive owner.

21:13.981 --> 21:17.484
Uh when I heard Kentucky needed
a washing machine I looked at ours...

21:17.567 --> 21:19.319
even though we need ours.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.363
Uh I said "I gotta pull
the trigger on this."

21:21.446 --> 21:22.948
- Hey honey!
- It seemed appropriate.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.701
- Guess who got traded to Flint?
- Who?

21:25.784 --> 21:26.952
Monix!

21:28.620 --> 21:30.831
Why the hell would he
want to come to Flint?

21:32.165 --> 21:33.834
I have no idea.

21:33.917 --> 21:36.253
Who cares right? I mean...

21:36.336 --> 21:39.047
He's got an NBA ring
and he's playing for the Tropics.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.549
Can you believe that?

21:40.632 --> 21:42.801
No I can't.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.722
I'll get it.

21:46.805 --> 21:49.975
It's like if you watch a porn movie
doesn't mean you got laid.

21:50.058 --> 21:53.186
No no. In fact it...
It often means the opposite.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.897
Monix was an All-American
at Michigan State...

21:55.981 --> 21:57.065
then went on to...

21:57.149 --> 21:58.191
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.275
You look great.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.319
Why are you here?

22:00.861 --> 22:03.905
Uh got traded. Yeah. Yeah.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.116
I... I mean why are you... you here?

22:07.492 --> 22:08.827
Can we talk?

22:08.910 --> 22:12.372
- Monix! Ha ha ha!
- Hey.

22:12.456 --> 22:13.456
- Oh what's up?
- Yeah.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.059
That ol' jump shot of yours
ain't broke yet, is it?

22:15.083 --> 22:16.710
- Not yet.
- Ha ha ha!

22:16.793 --> 22:18.962
Oh man... Oh hey!

22:19.046 --> 22:20.046
Great backdoor cut...

22:20.088 --> 22:22.591
for the lay-up against the Amigos
last Friday night man.

22:22.674 --> 22:25.427
Yeah ha ha. That's the way
basketball should be played!

22:25.510 --> 22:26.511
- Yeah.
- Up there.

22:26.595 --> 22:29.765
- Yeah...
- Too slow! Ha ha ha!

22:29.848 --> 22:31.725
Hey can you give us a second please?

22:31.808 --> 22:35.103
- Yeah no problem.
- Thanks, Kyle.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.356
Oh Monix!

22:37.439 --> 22:39.524
Why does your boyfriend like me
so much?

22:39.608 --> 22:41.401
You're his favorite player.

22:41.485 --> 22:43.653
I'd feel more comfortable
if he hated me.

22:43.737 --> 22:48.158
Listen I hope you didn't agree
to this trade because of me.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.536
What if I did?

22:51.620 --> 22:55.415
Then you'd be stuck
in Flint Michigan for no reason.

22:55.499 --> 22:56.499
You know what?

22:56.541 --> 22:58.519
You said you wanted to leave basketball
at the top of your game.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.628
When are you gonna quit?

22:59.711 --> 23:03.715
I'm at the top of my game.
I'm very close to the top.

23:07.302 --> 23:11.306
I just got traded for a fuckin' washing
machine. What am I talkin' about?

23:11.390 --> 23:13.100
Good night Ed.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.771
Thanks for the pep talk.

23:24.236 --> 23:27.906
Ed Monix is a tenacious defender
and he can hit the big shots.

23:27.989 --> 23:31.243
- Mm when he's not drunk.
- Which is never.

23:31.326 --> 23:33.930
Look there's nothing in the rule book
that says you can't play drunk.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.288
No actually there is.

23:35.372 --> 23:37.332
Remember those 30 rebounds
against San Diego?

23:37.416 --> 23:39.334
- Yeah.
- I don't remember 'em.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.335
Oh no.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.962
- Amaretto stone sours.
- Yes.

23:42.045 --> 23:43.564
- I will never believe that.
- All game long.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.340
- No way.
- I mixed 'em!

23:45.424 --> 23:47.968
Doesn't leave the table.

23:48.051 --> 23:50.011
Look guys you ain't gotta worry.

23:50.095 --> 23:53.473
'Cause tomorrow when I get this cast
taken off I'll be back on the team...

23:53.557 --> 23:56.059
and I will be rainin' down some threes!

23:56.143 --> 23:59.771
Cornelius you're a good friend
but that arm hasn't properly healed...

23:59.855 --> 24:02.816
and I've told you 100 times
you're never gonna play for the Tropics.

24:02.899 --> 24:04.109
You're a terrible athlete.

24:04.192 --> 24:08.405
Come on man! I'm a excellent athlete.
Look I broke this arm playin' for you.

24:08.488 --> 24:11.575
No, you broke it
playing with me in the driveway.

24:11.658 --> 24:12.826
You can't even make a lay-up.

24:12.909 --> 24:15.203
I'm an injured player man.
I should be on the bench.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.080
No you're not on the team.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.541
Well in my fantasy life
I'm on the team.

24:19.624 --> 24:22.294
Well let's just keep it that way right?

24:22.377 --> 24:24.880
Oh my God. What the fuck is that?
It's incredible.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.339
It's called fondue.

24:26.423 --> 24:29.009
- Fon what?
- Fondue.

24:29.092 --> 24:33.054
Three different cheeses melted.
That's what you're tasting.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.640
Gorgonzola muenster and cottage.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.642
It's the latest thing
from Sweden apparently.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.979
Well, I'm not surprised by that.
The Swedes are so inventive aren't they?

24:41.062 --> 24:42.189
- Oh, they are.
- Yep.

24:42.272 --> 24:44.983
They are my favorite producers
of pornography.

24:45.066 --> 24:47.319
They make an excellent fuck picture.

24:47.402 --> 24:51.281
Well I think I'll excuse myself
from this conversation right now.

24:51.364 --> 24:53.241
- To the men's room.
- Oh, stop it!

24:53.325 --> 24:54.409
To make your wiener sing.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.453
Boner machine.

24:56.536 --> 24:58.246
I am not a boner machine now.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.207
Swedish porn saved my life in 'Nam.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.791
- OK.
- Great here we go.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.085
- Come on! Fuck you guys!
- Let me get my violin.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.086
Swedish porn was the only thing...

25:05.170 --> 25:07.255
that kept my mind off Charlie
when I was in the shit.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.550
Is the shit in Ann Arbor? 'Cause
that's where you were during the war.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.928
- He really believes it.
- You were never in 'Nam...

25:13.011 --> 25:14.763
- Nope. Ha ha.
- You jive turkey.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.944
You just call me a jive turkey?

25:31.071 --> 25:33.198
No. No he did not.

25:33.281 --> 25:37.452
- He uh called you cocksucker.
- Yeah.

25:37.536 --> 25:38.638
- Yeah.
- Right... Right Cornelius?

25:38.662 --> 25:40.455
Yeah, yeah.
I just called you cocksucker.

25:40.539 --> 25:43.041
I'm pretty sure that
you called me a jive turkey.

25:43.124 --> 25:47.295
No, no. Now, Lou,
nobody called anyone a JT.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.798
Jive turkey is a little over the line
my man!

25:49.881 --> 25:51.299
Look we're all here.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.635
We all heard what was said
and we're in agreement.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.595
- Cornelius said cocksucker.
- Yes.

25:55.679 --> 25:56.679
- Right?
- Yeah.

25:56.721 --> 26:00.308
- He just said you suck cock.
- That's all he said about you.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.770
Now come on. Dig into that fondue
you little cocksucker.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.280
- We like playing games, don't we?
- We do we're playing one right now!

26:11.027 --> 26:12.255
I'm gonna show you guys
this game that I learned...

26:12.279 --> 26:14.823
- when I was in fucking 'Nam!
- Oh no no no no!

26:14.906 --> 26:16.283
Lou. Lou.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.535
Who's the jive turkey now?

26:22.455 --> 26:23.999
Ah ha ha ha ha!

26:24.082 --> 26:26.293
Gun's not loaded!

26:26.376 --> 26:29.796
- You son of a bitch!
- It's not loaded! It's not loaded!

26:29.879 --> 26:32.966
You shoulda seen your goddamn face!

26:33.049 --> 26:35.552
Oh there's no bullets in there!
I never load it!

26:35.635 --> 26:38.346
The gun was not loaded.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.349
I'll see you fuckers in hell!

26:41.433 --> 26:45.270
Ohh!

26:45.812 --> 26:48.607
Jackie, Love Me Sexy
is the worst song I've ever heard.

26:52.152 --> 26:55.113
Watch this! I did call you jive turkey.

26:55.196 --> 26:56.740
He did!

26:58.700 --> 27:02.370
I got one. Hey, Lou, I know
you slept with Mrs. Pepperfield!

27:02.454 --> 27:04.247
Grrr!

27:05.373 --> 27:08.168
We're saying nutty things
'cause they're not true.

27:08.251 --> 27:11.046
- My! Yeah.
- Especially that. More than the rest.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.798
- He's jonesing you.
- It never happened. Ha ha.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.759
- Hey. Bond.
- She's not ugly.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.178
- James Bond. Huh?
- Oh there it is.

27:18.261 --> 27:21.556
- How do you like your martini sir?
- Stirred, in... in a half-carafe.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.058
Wow.

27:25.101 --> 27:27.261
- He shoots himself.
- He shoots himself in the wiener.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.239
- Everybody OK?
- I think so.

27:38.323 --> 27:39.908
- Yeah.
- I'm fine.

27:39.991 --> 27:42.118
Wow!

27:42.202 --> 27:45.246
We just literally dodged a bullet.
Ha ha ha ha!

27:45.330 --> 27:47.874
We sure did!

27:47.957 --> 27:49.584
- We certainly...
- Except for Cornelius.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.419
Ohh!

27:51.503 --> 27:54.714
Oh ho ho. I did get shot!

27:56.841 --> 27:58.843

29:59.839 --> 30:01.508
Well they were fast.

30:01.591 --> 30:04.969
Fast? Man. Clarence should play
for the Celtics then. That boy can fly.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.763
Downtown,
that's all he ever talk about.

30:06.846 --> 30:09.033
"I'm goin' to the NBA, I'm goin'
to the NBA." Every day he say that.

30:09.057 --> 30:11.434
No, I don't.
Why don't you just shut up man?

30:11.518 --> 30:15.271
Say Monix why don't you let us
see that championship ring, m

30:15.355 --> 30:16.749
Don't think nobody here ever seen...

30:16.773 --> 30:18.316
- a championship ring before.
- Uh-uh.

30:18.399 --> 30:19.526
- All right.
- Yes sir.

30:19.609 --> 30:21.236
- Yes!
- Yo man let me see it!

30:21.319 --> 30:23.696
Oh! Holy balls.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.574
Oh my God look at this right here.
"Champion" in sparkling gold.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.409
Man why are you wearing that
on your neck?

30:28.493 --> 30:30.763
If I had a ring like that
I'd have it on my finger every day...

30:30.787 --> 30:32.747
so the honeys could see it.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.499
I'm not quite as flashy as you.

30:34.582 --> 30:37.126
I just like wearing it
around my neck that's all.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.837
- That's cool man.
- I hear that.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.339
He should be embarrassed.

30:42.757 --> 30:44.843
Embarrassed?

30:44.926 --> 30:47.846
He sat through every playoff game.

30:47.929 --> 30:50.682
Then he gonna walk around us
with all the shine...

30:50.765 --> 30:52.767
like he some kind of hero or somethin'.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.728
Oh come on Clarence.
You're just actin' jealous.

30:55.812 --> 31:02.110
Whatever. I ain't never rode the bench
and then go call myself a champion.

31:02.193 --> 31:05.905
Somebody need to snatch that ring
off his sorry neck.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.469
- You wanna snatch it? Come on.
- I...

31:07.532 --> 31:09.652
- Be my guest.
- I don't think your knees can take it.

31:09.701 --> 31:13.413
Hey! Hey I got a ring up here too.
Mine says love.

31:15.623 --> 31:17.125
Think about that.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.338
Everybody love everybody!

31:22.422 --> 31:23.965
Come on!

31:24.048 --> 31:26.301
Eleven more hours to go.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.307
Another easy basket
for the Spirits.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.392
Tropics with the ball.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.812
Hey honey!

31:37.896 --> 31:40.857
Jackie Moon waving to the fans
as he makes his way down the court.

31:40.940 --> 31:42.126
Keep it alive right here!
Throw it in the blender.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.150
He truly is a showman.

31:43.192 --> 31:44.503
No! Changed my mind.
Right back, though.

31:44.527 --> 31:46.463
- OK. OK.
- Right back to you. Give it back again!

31:46.487 --> 31:47.822
- You got it.
- No right back.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.365
- No?
- Yeah. Yeah. Whoa.

31:49.449 --> 31:52.076
- Sure?
- Yeah. Right back. Come on now. No.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.912
Right back reset.
Throw it to Papa.

31:53.995 --> 31:55.055
- No right back out.
- All right.

31:55.079 --> 31:56.599
- Right back. Right back.
- Here you go, Jackie.

31:56.623 --> 31:57.892
- Back to you. Right back though.
- You're right. OK.

31:57.916 --> 31:58.916
- Shoot!
- Whoo!

31:58.958 --> 32:00.144
- All right right on.
- Clear. Yeah.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.544
- You ready?
- No right back.

32:01.628 --> 32:03.046
- No?
- Yeah. OK clear.

32:03.129 --> 32:04.148
- All right I'm goin'.
- My turn.

32:04.172 --> 32:06.466
Yeah I'll bet my alleged son
he won't make this.

32:06.549 --> 32:08.676
Jackie Moon
finally making a move...

32:08.760 --> 32:11.554
- and it is worth the wait!
- All day long! Whoo!

32:11.638 --> 32:12.638
Way to go Jackie!

32:12.680 --> 32:14.682
- Traveling!
- No no no no! One and a half steps!

32:14.766 --> 32:19.687
- Come on, Jackie. You walked.
- Suck my cock! I'll murder your family!

32:20.897 --> 32:22.207
- You're gone Jackie Moon!
- What? What?

32:22.231 --> 32:24.692
- Jackie Moon is ejected from the game.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.986
- What did I say?
- You said "S my C ."

32:29.572 --> 32:32.575
And one lucky fan
will go home with a game ball.

32:32.659 --> 32:33.785
That's your head next time.

32:33.868 --> 32:35.220
You're a big baby Jackie.
You cannot tell me to S my C.

32:35.244 --> 32:37.288
Jackie Moon and the referee
really going at it here.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.248
- I didn't say anything.
- You said "S my C ."

32:39.332 --> 32:41.518
- I barely raised my voice.
- I should call your mother.

32:41.542 --> 32:43.795
You need a phone to heaven to do that.

32:43.878 --> 32:45.838
- Maybe your ma didn't go to heaven.
- Oh dear.

32:45.922 --> 32:48.549
Oh. Oh my. Oh no.

32:49.467 --> 32:51.487
OK. Everyone off the floor.
Let's go. Tropics, let's go.

32:51.511 --> 32:52.679
Why... No Jackie.

32:52.762 --> 32:56.307
It appears a line has been crossed
by Father Pat of all people.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.643
- Look Jackie I'm sorry.
- Stop the broadcast.

32:58.726 --> 33:02.480
Jackie Moon is pulling his team
off the court.

33:02.563 --> 33:04.565
You forfeit this game Jackie
if you keep walking.

33:04.649 --> 33:08.277
- That's fine.
- You threatened to kill my family!

33:08.361 --> 33:10.281
God damn it, Pat.
What the hell's wrong with you?

33:10.363 --> 33:11.948
Don't get on your high horse Redwood.

33:12.031 --> 33:14.200
You've got a lot of demons yourself.

33:14.283 --> 33:15.302
Thank you for staying Dick.

33:15.326 --> 33:16.577
No I am leaving.

33:16.661 --> 33:17.954
I've thrown to commercial.

33:18.037 --> 33:20.873
I have to be back in about 30 seconds
or so but this is symbolic.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.250
We go to church together.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.251
Not anymore.

33:23.334 --> 33:25.920
♪ Hey Flint Tropics welcome back ♪

33:26.004 --> 33:28.423
- ♪ Give the Amigos a heart attack ♪
- I tried Jackie.

33:29.048 --> 33:30.508
They won't take it.

33:30.591 --> 33:32.719
Look, I... I don't know
what your bank is telling you.

33:32.802 --> 33:35.013
This is a real check.
I signed it myself.

33:35.096 --> 33:37.306
It's written in glitter man.

33:37.390 --> 33:41.436
Can't you just you know like
write me a regular-size check?

33:41.519 --> 33:44.439
Maybe you should try a different bank.
A big bank.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.691
- Bigger bank?
- That has a big check department.

33:46.774 --> 33:48.317
- That's what I'd do.
- OK.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.028
- Right? All right.
- Yeah.

33:50.111 --> 33:50.152
Whoo Scootsie he is takin' you to town!

Get him Twig. C'mon!

33:56.576 --> 33:57.576
There we go.

33:57.618 --> 33:59.662
- All right guys. Hey listen up.
- Hey hey.

33:59.746 --> 34:03.791
Let's go. Eyes up here.
Turn that contraption off. Come on.

34:04.375 --> 34:07.045
Look uh just got off the phone
with the Commissioner.

34:07.128 --> 34:09.880
He convinced the board
to pass another merger rule.

34:09.964 --> 34:13.509
We gotta average 2,000 fans per
home game for the rest of the season.

34:13.592 --> 34:14.592
Ahhh.

34:14.635 --> 34:16.262
- Two thou every home game?
- Damn. What?

34:16.344 --> 34:19.474
Commissioner says they're not gonna
take a franchise that doesn't have fans.

34:19.556 --> 34:22.310
- He's being a real dick.
- Good Lord Jackie Moon.

34:22.393 --> 34:28.065
Winning these games is gonna be hard
but 2000 fans? Impossible man.

34:28.149 --> 34:31.194
It's OK, Scootsie.
'Cause I got a plan. All right?

34:31.277 --> 34:34.155
Now, you all know
we're the ABA game of the week right?

34:34.237 --> 34:37.867
Could be a lot of television cameras
out there, so we just gotta be tiptop.

34:37.949 --> 34:39.702
So what's the plan?

34:39.786 --> 34:41.120
I brought a secret weapon.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.371
It's gonna make us
look extra cool on TV.

34:43.456 --> 34:45.083
What the hell is that?

34:45.166 --> 34:47.418
- It's eyeliner dummy.
- Oh...

34:48.127 --> 34:49.920
Now who's first? Monix?

34:50.838 --> 34:55.259
Oh yeah. Just let me get a fresh Maxi Pad
out of my purse.

34:56.719 --> 35:00.973
Looks like Jackie Moon has brought a
trick from Broadway to the court tonight.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.393
Trap trap trap trap trap.

35:04.477 --> 35:05.704
Point of no return.
Go back. Go back.

35:05.728 --> 35:07.563
Horse in the trailer.
Nowhere to go.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.732
Hey. Look at my eyes.
No look at my eyes.

35:09.816 --> 35:12.360
Are you scared? Tropical storm.
Eye of the hurricane.

35:12.443 --> 35:15.113
I'm gonna hypnotize you.
I'm not gonna blink. I'm not gonna blink.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.824
- Look at me.
- Where you goin'? Where you goin'?

35:17.907 --> 35:19.367
Jackie tips the ball away.

35:19.450 --> 35:20.993
Twiggy picks it up and takes it in.

35:21.077 --> 35:23.871
- Two points, Tropics.
- Way to go Twiggy!

35:23.955 --> 35:25.748
Make sure the camera gets your eyes!

35:25.832 --> 35:27.041
This team is on fire...

35:27.125 --> 35:28.584
- Oooooh!
- Early in the game.

35:28.668 --> 35:29.812
Oh they're flaming all right.

35:29.836 --> 35:32.713
Nice lay-up.
Nice lay-up Twiggy huh?

35:32.797 --> 35:35.675
- Who's got character now?
- My confidence is sky-high right now.

35:35.758 --> 35:38.177
Oh! Ohh! Ohh!

35:38.261 --> 35:40.805
- What's with Vakidis?
- Ohh! Ahh! Oh ha ha!

35:40.888 --> 35:43.117
- What the hell's wrong with Vakidis?
- I don't know man.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.018
Oh shit! Your eyeliner's running.

35:46.102 --> 35:48.354
Oh yeah. Yours is kinda smoky too.

35:48.437 --> 35:49.748
All right everyone.
Try not to sweat if you can.

35:49.772 --> 35:51.732
Hell no. This... this shit
burnin' already, man.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.401
- Yeah it kinda is.
- Goddamn.

35:53.484 --> 35:55.045
- Oh.
- I'm going to the bench man. Move!

35:55.069 --> 35:56.109
- What's happening?
- Shit!

35:56.154 --> 35:58.197
The Tropics seem to be
disabled in some way.

35:58.281 --> 36:00.408
God it burns. Whoo!

36:00.491 --> 36:03.578
Do they test this on animals
or is that just a lie?

36:03.661 --> 36:05.621
Feels like I got cat piss in my eyes!

36:05.705 --> 36:07.766
Just open your eyes with your fingers
guys. It's really nice.

36:07.790 --> 36:09.292
Cock sandwich that hurts!

36:09.375 --> 36:10.686
- Fuckin' idiots.
- That feels really good.

36:10.710 --> 36:13.254
Monix where's your makeup
huh buddy?

36:13.337 --> 36:16.591
Hey how come it says Monix on
your jersey when your name's Pussy?

36:16.674 --> 36:18.652
- I was curious about this...
- Fuck you, Petrelli.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.845
- Hey, hey, Monix!
- Get your hands off me!

36:20.928 --> 36:23.973
- Get back here! You little bitch!
- We're on TV!

36:24.056 --> 36:26.642
- I don't give a shit!
- Commissioner's watching.

36:26.726 --> 36:29.770
- You wanna kill the merger? C'mon.
- Everybody relax.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.654
Looks like a little gentleman's
disagreement on the court. Nothing big.

36:32.690 --> 36:34.108
No these girls aren't gonna fight.

36:34.192 --> 36:37.028
No but a little bit of a delay
in play for a moment here.

36:37.111 --> 36:39.739
What about during commercial?

36:39.822 --> 36:42.575
Yeah I like it. Yeah it's good.

36:42.658 --> 36:46.037
- Uh, Father Pat, timeout.
- Timeout white!

36:46.120 --> 36:49.790
It's a timeout on the floor with 9 minutes
and 16 seconds left in the first.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.459
The Tropics two the Amigos six.

36:51.542 --> 36:54.921
And we'll be right back
after these messages from Shasta.

36:55.004 --> 36:56.505
And clear.

36:56.589 --> 36:58.007

37:01.177 --> 37:03.137
Oh here we go.

37:05.097 --> 37:07.141
- Come on!
- Get him!

37:07.225 --> 37:11.312
Ohhh this is a good old-fashioned
bare-fisted brawl here on the court.

37:11.395 --> 37:13.439
My goodness.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.860
Look at the Russian bear go.
Throwing people around like rag dolls.

37:17.944 --> 37:22.615
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?

37:22.698 --> 37:25.594
Oh, look at Monix take it to Petrelli.
I wish the people at home could see this.

37:25.618 --> 37:26.618
I could hurt someone.

37:26.661 --> 37:30.665

38:03.489 --> 38:04.490
Lou!

38:05.366 --> 38:07.159
Scoreboard's
not looking good guys.

38:07.243 --> 38:09.578
Think it's time for us to make
some serious adjustments.

38:09.662 --> 38:11.163
Here's the chalk Coach.

38:16.210 --> 38:20.381
Huh? That's right.
That's how frustrated I am.

38:20.464 --> 38:24.010
OK? I can stand here and I can talk
X's and O's all day long...

38:24.093 --> 38:26.262
but this is about something else.

38:26.345 --> 38:27.888
We're not playing Tropical.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.516
We're playing tight.

38:30.599 --> 38:33.894
I mean if we just open up our hearts
and let our passion come out...

38:33.978 --> 38:35.813
we can do anything.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.482
You ready?

38:38.566 --> 38:41.319

to bring our passion out.

39:00.838 --> 39:03.049
Ha ha. There it goes.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.718
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.

39:05.801 --> 39:07.511
This is the best idea I've ever had.

39:07.595 --> 39:08.929
Great work Stacey.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.599
Oh Twiggy welcome to the big city.

39:11.682 --> 39:12.850
- Ha ha.
- Ooh!

39:12.933 --> 39:14.328
Jackie I don't... I don't know
about this, Jackie.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.352
- Ha ha ha!
- Damn.

39:15.394 --> 39:16.854
Believe it! This is happening!

39:16.937 --> 39:19.148
- Downtown.
- Yeah.

39:19.732 --> 39:21.525
Yeah you can call me Downtown.

39:21.609 --> 39:25.571
Oh! Nice jumpin' joint!
Aah! Ha ha ha!

39:25.654 --> 39:28.532
Pep talk! All right.
What team's in a rut now?

39:29.575 --> 39:33.204
Not the Tropics anymore no sirree.
We got strong...

39:34.705 --> 39:36.290
Jesus this guy's a bummer.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.667
Does anybody here wanna talk
about the fucking game?

39:38.751 --> 39:40.795
Hey. Watch your language.
Not in front of my wife.

39:40.878 --> 39:43.464
Uh sorry Mrs. Moon.

39:43.547 --> 39:47.593
Come on, man. Trying to bring the love
into the room and all you do is complain.

39:47.676 --> 39:50.805
My wife is standing here naked.
What more do you want me to do?

39:51.889 --> 39:54.642
Listen Jackie th... there is
no shortcut to winning.

39:54.725 --> 39:57.269
You can't buy it you can't pray for it...

39:57.353 --> 40:01.941
and you can't stare at your wife's ass
and start hitting three-pointers.

40:02.024 --> 40:05.111
We need a game plan Jackie.

40:05.194 --> 40:07.947
So he the expert. He should know.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.591
He done seen the game
from every angle...

40:09.615 --> 40:10.991
- sittin' on the bench.
- Damn!

40:11.075 --> 40:15.287
Hey, guess what? The Celtics weren't
just all-stars, they were a team. A team!

40:15.371 --> 40:19.750
As opposed to a bunch of selfish
assholes tryin' to look cool every night.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.460
I mean call us what you want to...

40:21.544 --> 40:25.047
but we ain't never sat around
and pretended like we some champions.

40:25.131 --> 40:31.804
Yeah you got a little ring and all
but you personally you ain't won shit.

40:35.141 --> 40:37.059
Clarence I want you to have this ring...

40:37.143 --> 40:41.480
as a token
of what you will never achieve.

40:41.564 --> 40:44.525
Champion or not,
at least I played the game.

40:44.608 --> 40:46.402
And I got news for you Clarence...

40:46.485 --> 40:50.364
for all your flash
you are never gonna play in the NBA.

40:50.448 --> 40:53.451
You are pissing your career away.

40:53.534 --> 40:56.162
And one day
you're gonna look back on your life...

40:56.245 --> 41:01.250
and you're gonna realize that you never
even learned how to play basketball.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.190
Oh jeez!

41:24.273 --> 41:26.275
What the hell?

41:28.235 --> 41:29.403
Shit.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.489
Get your hands in the air.

41:37.077 --> 41:39.079
Monix bail's been set.

41:45.419 --> 41:47.046
Lynn can I ask you a favor?

41:47.129 --> 41:50.007
Oh you mean besides
bailing your ass outta jail?

41:50.090 --> 41:51.842
Lynn no one can drain it like you.

41:53.385 --> 41:56.347
I think I drained all I can
out of there.

41:56.430 --> 41:58.557
- That hurt?
- Mm. Not really.

41:58.641 --> 42:00.935
- How about that?
- Ah... yeah.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.436
- Good.
- Ha.

42:04.396 --> 42:09.026
Listen uh this is long overdue
but I wanna apologize.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.238
For what?

42:12.321 --> 42:17.618
For uh you know back then
we had some problems.

42:17.701 --> 42:21.413
Oh did you wanna apologize
for cheating on me?

42:21.997 --> 42:23.791
Twice.

42:23.874 --> 42:25.417
Hey I cheated on you once.

42:25.501 --> 42:28.879
There... There just happened
to be two girls there ha ha.

42:30.005 --> 42:32.174
- Still not funny?
- Still not funny.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.511
And where's the necklace I made you?

42:38.514 --> 42:40.849
Monix it was the high point
of your career.

42:40.933 --> 42:43.644
- Riding the bench?
- You didn't just ride the bench.

42:43.727 --> 42:45.646
Who did the Celtics practice against?

42:46.730 --> 42:48.208
- Second stringers.
- Second stringers...

42:48.232 --> 42:50.484
and every day you pushed
your team to the limit.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.987
I know I was there I was the one
working on your stupid knee.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.738
I didn't deserve that ring Lynn.

42:54.822 --> 42:58.951
I hardly played.
I was never the guy to hit the big shot.

42:59.034 --> 43:01.662
Wanna know why
things didn't work out between us?

43:01.745 --> 43:02.663
Yeah.

43:02.746 --> 43:07.084
You hate yourself so much
it's impossible to love you.

43:07.167 --> 43:09.003
Wow.

43:09.086 --> 43:11.338
Kinda brutally honest.

43:14.383 --> 43:16.677
Did we have some fun?

43:16.760 --> 43:18.095
You're kind of fun.

43:18.178 --> 43:20.889
Didn't we?

43:20.973 --> 43:23.392
Sometimes.

43:30.733 --> 43:32.318
- What are you doing?
- There he is.

43:32.401 --> 43:34.069
Whoo ooh. Ha ha.

43:34.153 --> 43:35.964
- Been lookin' all over for you.
- 'Bout time...

43:35.988 --> 43:37.531
you scored somethin'. Ha ha.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.284
See ya later Ed. 'Scuse me guys.

43:40.367 --> 43:41.367
Excused.

43:41.410 --> 43:45.080
Uh doin' your girl in the locker room
huh? Classy.

43:45.164 --> 43:47.499
- What are you guys doin' here?
- Ahem.

43:47.583 --> 43:50.669
We want you to coach the team.

43:50.753 --> 43:52.963
- What?
- You know the game better than Jackie.

43:53.047 --> 43:57.092
I'm flattered but I don't think
Jackie would be too happy about this.

43:57.176 --> 44:00.721
Come on don't worry about Jackie.
I mean I got this.

44:00.804 --> 44:02.264
OK Tropics hustle up.

44:03.849 --> 44:05.893
Five six seven eight.

44:05.976 --> 44:09.938
One and two and three and four
and turn like you mean it.

44:10.022 --> 44:11.273
Arch that back Bee Bee.

44:11.357 --> 44:13.734
I like it. Whoo! Good rotation.

44:13.817 --> 44:14.985
Beautiful seahorses.

44:15.069 --> 44:16.320
Leg kick Scootsie.

44:16.403 --> 44:19.323
Nice! And freeze it.

44:23.869 --> 44:25.120
And then we start the game.

44:25.204 --> 44:26.222
Now when I say freeze it...

44:26.246 --> 44:28.832
you guys gotta freeze it OK?

44:28.999 --> 44:31.752
- Hey!
- Hey.

44:31.835 --> 44:33.379
You're back. All right.

44:33.462 --> 44:36.507
We got a extra costume
right over there for you.

44:36.590 --> 44:41.261
I'm not here to do wh... whatever this is.
What is this?

44:41.345 --> 44:43.055
What is this? Ha ha.

44:43.138 --> 44:47.101
Come on man this is...
This is the future of basketball OK?

44:47.184 --> 44:50.771
This is entertainment.
You'll get it. You'll catch on.

44:50.854 --> 44:52.022
Ah...

44:55.359 --> 44:59.113
Look Jackie. Now don't get mad
but some... some of us got together...

44:59.196 --> 45:01.740
and we asked old Monix
if he'd teach us a little bit.

45:01.824 --> 45:03.867
Wait what do you mean teach us?

45:03.951 --> 45:08.664
I teach you guys things.
Like expert choreography and stuff.

45:08.747 --> 45:10.791
No.

45:10.874 --> 45:14.545
We wanna give Monix
a chance to coach Coach.

45:15.963 --> 45:18.549
What's goin' on here?

45:19.550 --> 45:21.218
What is this?

45:23.220 --> 45:24.555
Clarence?

45:26.890 --> 45:28.976
This is a mutiny.

45:30.894 --> 45:33.355
You guys all in on this?

45:37.109 --> 45:40.070
You motherfuckin' cocksuckers.

45:40.154 --> 45:42.281
All of you.

45:43.157 --> 45:47.494
I have dedicated my life
to this team, OK?

45:47.578 --> 45:49.913
I have given you guys my soul!

45:51.498 --> 45:54.835
I mean, who bought you
those boots last Halloween?

45:54.918 --> 45:57.397
It... That... That would be you Coach.
You bought us those boots.

45:57.421 --> 45:58.421
I bought 'em!

45:58.464 --> 46:00.104
I really liked them boots.
They were nice.

46:00.174 --> 46:02.301
They're really nice boots.

46:02.384 --> 46:03.927
Yeah we love ya.

46:04.011 --> 46:07.097
But Monix just knows
the X's and O's baby. That's all.

46:07.181 --> 46:08.181
Ohh...

46:08.223 --> 46:11.059
Aw, come on, come on,
don't turn your back on us.

46:11.143 --> 46:13.771
Hey hey hey hey hey. Listen.

46:15.481 --> 46:19.526
How about this I'll be the offensive
and defensive coordinator...

46:19.610 --> 46:22.654
and you can still be head coach.

46:23.489 --> 46:27.284
And you're the best promoter.
We gonna need fans right?

46:28.410 --> 46:30.170
Do you guys really think
I'm a good promoter?

46:30.204 --> 46:33.040
- Yeah yeah yeah.
- You know you are man.

46:33.123 --> 46:36.084
- I'm probably the best in the league.
- Yeah, that's what they say.

46:36.168 --> 46:37.503
- Top three.
- Yup.

46:37.586 --> 46:39.379
- Right up there.
- Yeah.

46:39.463 --> 46:41.256
OK.

46:47.471 --> 46:48.471
There.

46:48.514 --> 46:52.351
Careful, don't blow too hard at first
'cause it'll give a high-pitched squeak.

46:52.434 --> 46:54.561
You just wanna blow easy.

46:54.645 --> 46:57.245
And once she starts responding
then you can... you can let it fly.

46:57.314 --> 46:58.816
Thanks Coach.

47:03.821 --> 47:05.364
Uh...

47:05.739 --> 47:08.659
All right let's practice guys!

47:08.742 --> 47:08.783
If we play unselfish, fundamental
basketball we can make a run at this.

47:08.784 --> 47:13.956
If we play unselfish, fundamental
basketball we can make a run at this.

47:14.706 --> 47:19.837
By unselfish I mean we sprint up
the court on every fast break...

47:19.920 --> 47:23.549
not because we might get a dunk and
get your dick sucked after the game...

47:23.632 --> 47:26.927
but because sprinting might pull
the defense out of position...

47:27.010 --> 47:29.364
Wait wait wait wait. So what's goin' on
with the blow jobs again?

47:29.388 --> 47:31.598
Yeah, 'cause I vote
we keep them blow jobs Jack.

47:31.682 --> 47:35.477
- Yeah. All in favor?
- Come on let the man talk.

47:35.561 --> 47:37.229
Thank you Clarence.

47:37.312 --> 47:40.524
Now till we start playing
like a real team...

47:42.192 --> 47:45.112
we're gonna practice without the ball.

47:46.405 --> 47:48.615
That's a waste.

47:48.699 --> 47:51.201
OK let's run the offense!

47:52.619 --> 47:55.205
- Without a ball?
- Yeah without the ball Clarence.

47:55.289 --> 47:57.708
Let's go everybody get in position.

47:57.791 --> 48:01.670
- Patch that ball up Scootsie.
- Come on! Hustle!

48:01.753 --> 48:03.755
OK Clarence flash through the lane.

48:03.839 --> 48:06.466
- Hustle Clarence!
- Come on come on.

48:06.550 --> 48:07.550
Ball ball ball!

48:07.593 --> 48:10.220
We been runnin'
the same play all day.

48:10.304 --> 48:12.347
Yeah can we maybe try
play number two?

48:12.431 --> 48:15.642
No! I want you to be brain-dead
gentlemen!

48:15.726 --> 48:19.688
'Cause someday you're gonna be
too tired or too nervous to think.

48:19.771 --> 48:23.150
And when you are,
this is the play that I'm gonna call.

48:23.233 --> 48:25.861
We need to be able to run
this play in our sleep.

48:25.944 --> 48:28.488
I'm a rover, Coach.
I'm just gonna go rover.

48:28.572 --> 48:31.116
No, don't just go rovin'.
Run the play Jackie Moon.

48:31.199 --> 48:32.701
I'm creatin' a diversion though...

48:32.784 --> 48:35.545
- by runnin' in circles over here.
- Don't lose your mind Jackie Moon.

48:35.579 --> 48:37.497
We are runnin' this until we puke.

48:37.581 --> 48:40.500
- Well basically we have.
- Yeah I'm pretty beat Coach.

48:40.584 --> 48:42.836
"Until we puke"
is not a figure of speech.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.838
We are literally going to puke.

48:44.922 --> 48:46.548
What does he mean by "literally"?

48:50.761 --> 48:53.055
I wish you were still
a washing machine!

48:53.138 --> 48:56.683
Get up and run, Coach!
You're gonna puke like everybody else!

48:56.767 --> 49:01.021
I can't puke, Monix!
I've never puked in my life ever!

49:01.104 --> 49:02.272
You're lying to me.

49:02.356 --> 49:06.026
I've been sick before, I've just never
puked. Swear on my mother's grave.

49:06.109 --> 49:09.696
What about when you were a baby?
Babies throw up all the time.

49:09.780 --> 49:13.283
My mom said I never did it. I swear.

49:14.534 --> 49:16.411
She said I was fascinating.

49:16.495 --> 49:20.874
In fact the local PBS wanted to do
a documentary on me.

49:22.709 --> 49:24.419
Have you ever been punched
in the jejunum?

49:24.503 --> 49:26.380
No what's a jejunum?

49:26.463 --> 49:28.590
It's part of the small intestine.

49:28.674 --> 49:30.342
I don't think so.

49:30.425 --> 49:34.805
I mean I've been punched in the armpit
before, and in the wrist twice.

49:35.597 --> 49:39.601
Coccyx and in the back of the knee.

49:40.143 --> 49:43.730
Both eyes and I've been punched
right in my... my tracheal...

49:43.814 --> 49:45.190
Unh!

49:47.150 --> 49:48.735
Oh...

49:48.819 --> 49:50.153
Oh!

49:51.488 --> 49:53.115
Hunh!

49:53.198 --> 49:55.325
Ohh!

49:55.409 --> 49:56.743
Hunh...

49:56.827 --> 49:58.370
Ah ah.

49:58.453 --> 49:59.997
Hunh...

50:00.080 --> 50:02.499
Hohh.

50:02.582 --> 50:04.793
Let... Let that out.

50:04.876 --> 50:05.961
Hohh.

50:06.044 --> 50:08.296
- Go ahead Jackie. Just let it go.
- Hhhoh!

50:08.380 --> 50:11.675
Hey hey hey.

50:12.509 --> 50:14.386
Hunh...

50:14.469 --> 50:15.762
Hohh... urrrgh.

50:15.846 --> 50:18.473
Get ahold of yourself Ja... Jackie!

50:18.557 --> 50:22.310
Let go! Hold it in Jackie! Hold it in!

50:22.394 --> 50:24.396
Get off me God damn it!

50:24.479 --> 50:25.772
- Jackie!
- Bleeuurgh!

50:32.279 --> 50:33.739
We are seeing a very different...

50:33.822 --> 50:35.383
Tropics basketball team
than we're used to...

50:35.407 --> 50:36.616
aren't we Lou?

50:36.700 --> 50:38.994
Playing with a lot of energy
and a lot of confidence.

50:39.077 --> 50:40.179
They're movin' the ball well.

50:40.203 --> 50:41.222
It looks like they're gonna win this game.

50:41.246 --> 50:43.373
- The only question is by how much?
- Mm.

50:44.541 --> 50:46.168
Jangel has the ball now.

50:46.251 --> 50:48.688

50:57.929 --> 51:00.474
The crowd is really excited tonight.

51:00.557 --> 51:01.808
They know what's at stake Dick.

51:01.892 --> 51:05.187
Yup gettin' their home team

51:19.743 --> 51:21.012

51:21.036 --> 51:23.205
- Corn dogs.

51:23.288 --> 51:24.831
See if we score 125 points...

51:24.915 --> 51:27.393

in here a free corn dog, all right?

51:27.417 --> 51:29.628
Yeah, sorry, Monix.
We don't even got corn dogs.

51:29.711 --> 51:32.047

51:59.324 --> 52:01.594

He'll go with his right. He loves
his right one. He likes the right hand.

52:22.305 --> 52:23.783
- What are you doin'?
- Clarence drives.

52:23.807 --> 52:25.892

01:01:37.735 --> 01:01:41.072
- Ha. I... I shouldn't. You know I shouldn't.
- But you want to.

01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:45.159
Ha ha. Yes I said I cannot say no to you.
We are gonna get some pussy aren't we?

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:47.036
- Ha ha ha.

01:01:49.163 --> 01:01:51.582
Come on!

01:01:51.666 --> 01:01:53.418
I'm scared Clarence.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:57.463
It's a baby bear.
It's trained and everything.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.465
Who's a good bear?

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.134
Who used to live in the woods?

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:04.804
I don't care. I'm terrified of
those things. I'm freakin' out.

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:06.305
Come on get it together.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:09.225
Oh oh I'm startin' to feel really dizzy.

01:02:09.308 --> 01:02:10.560
Break his neck! Come on!

01:02:10.643 --> 01:02:12.812
- Call it off?
- No! No.

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:15.356
OK. I gotta give these people a show.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.650
- Are you guys ready?
- Uh-huh.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:20.486
- You have to give me your safe word.
- No I don't need a safe word.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:24.991
OK, I'll tell you what, if you feel
like you're in danger just say, um...

01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:27.451
spumoni.

01:02:27.493 --> 01:02:30.163
No I... I don't need spumoni OK?
Let's get this show on the road.

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:32.665
Bobby Dee.

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:40.673
- Let's go!
- Go... Go... Go ahead man.

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:45.428
What are you afraid of?

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:47.638
Hey.

01:02:49.307 --> 01:02:51.434
We're both wearing red.

01:02:51.517 --> 01:02:54.687
- Sorry I'm not ignoring you. I'm just...
- That's stupid Jackie!

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:57.273
- Trying to deal with him right now.
- Oh.

01:02:58.858 --> 01:03:00.276
I like your top hat though.

01:03:00.359 --> 01:03:04.030
Thanks. It was normal size
but I put it in the dryer.

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:05.632
How long you been
working with the bear?

01:03:05.656 --> 01:03:07.617
Um just like a day or so.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.035
What?

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:11.913
But I've been working with cats
for like 12 years.

01:03:11.996 --> 01:03:14.832
So I'm very familiar with animals.

01:03:14.916 --> 01:03:16.834
Great.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:18.544
- C'mon!
- Hey, Dewie.

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:21.047
Fuck that shit!

01:03:24.008 --> 01:03:25.301
I'm outta here. Spumoni.

01:03:25.384 --> 01:03:28.513
No nope. No no.
You can't quit now. We just started.

01:03:30.348 --> 01:03:32.058
We got to give these people
a show, man.

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:33.577
- Yeah you're right.
- That guy's a pussy!

01:03:33.601 --> 01:03:37.063
Test him out.
I'm just gonna be right over here.

01:03:38.022 --> 01:03:39.941
- Do something!
- Come on, Dewie.

01:03:40.024 --> 01:03:41.943
You're just nothin' but a dumb bear.

01:03:42.026 --> 01:03:44.320
Smack smack. Yep. Whoo.

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.242
Crazy fists. I'm comin' with crazy fists.

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:51.285
Huh?

01:03:51.369 --> 01:03:53.871
Yeah. Huh? This is fine
he's not doing anything.

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:01.003
Flint can you dig it?

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:02.129
Jackie Moon Flint...

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:03.881
- Aaargh!
- Shit!

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:05.174
Oh! Oh!

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:08.094
Aaargh! Aaargh!

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:10.137
Aah! Aaaargh!

01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:12.598

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:13.683
Spumoni!

01:04:13.766 --> 01:04:15.643
One round. No spumoni!

01:04:15.726 --> 01:04:17.520
Fuck you Clarence! Spumoni!

01:04:17.603 --> 01:04:20.106

01:04:35.329 --> 01:04:38.124

01:04:45.339 --> 01:04:48.301
How many times
do I gotta say spumoni?

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:51.196
- Somebody's got to do something.
- I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.764
Don't worry Jackie!
I'm coming Jackie.

01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:55.474

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:57.351

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:07.612
Good. Shh.

01:05:07.695 --> 01:05:11.365
Nobody move. Nobody move.

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:15.494
Where are you precious?

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:18.164
Dewie?

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:21.167
Everyone just remain seated.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.419
I think he left.

01:05:23.502 --> 01:05:24.502
Dewie?

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:27.590
Aaah!

01:05:27.673 --> 01:05:29.508
Everybody panic!

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:33.554
Oh my God there's a bear
loose in the Coliseum!

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:35.723
There will be no refunds!

01:05:35.806 --> 01:05:38.851
Your refund will be escaping
this deathtrap with your life!

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:41.479
If you have a small child
use it as a shield!

01:05:41.562 --> 01:05:43.189
They love the tender meat.

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:46.692
Cover your sodas Dewie loves sugar.

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:52.156
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hey Commish.

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:54.909
What do ya think?
Packed house right?

01:05:54.992 --> 01:05:57.662
I need to speak with you
and the rest of the team Jackie.

01:05:57.745 --> 01:06:00.998
OK. Locker room? All right.

01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:01.247
This whole merger thing
has been really complicated.

01:06:01.248 --> 01:06:04.669
This whole merger thing
has been really complicated.

01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:09.215
It's taken a lot of my time
out of my life away from my family.

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:15.805
Look even if you beat the Spurs
on Saturday...

01:06:15.888 --> 01:06:18.766
the Tropics won't be going
to the NBA next year.

01:06:18.849 --> 01:06:20.643
Come on man.

01:06:20.726 --> 01:06:22.329
What... What the hell
are you talkin' about?

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:26.107
The expansion committee had
an emergency meeting in Manhattan.

01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:30.611
And they decided that Flint
just isn't a big enough media market.

01:06:30.695 --> 01:06:33.322
Well tough shit!
We done made it this far.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:34.907
- Mm-hm.
- And rules is rules.

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:37.827
Guys it's over.

01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:39.912
There's nothing I can do.

01:06:42.456 --> 01:06:46.711
Jackie, I'm man enough
to admit when I'm wrong.

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:51.173
I never thought you'd pull it off.
But you did.

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:55.428
Good luck.

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:57.596
Psh! Right.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:02.560
Jackie this is the type of deal
you can work around, ain't it?

01:07:03.769 --> 01:07:06.814
Yeah, you Jackie Moon. I mean,
you can just make a phone call right?

01:07:06.897 --> 01:07:08.315
Uh-huh.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.361
Ah sorry guys. I... I let you down.

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.406
I'm nothin' but a big phony.

01:07:15.489 --> 01:07:16.489
Mm-mm.

01:07:16.532 --> 01:07:18.743
Oh man don't talk like that.
You ain't no phony.

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:23.706
Yes I am. You know my song
Love Me Sexy?

01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:24.874
Of course yeah.

01:07:24.957 --> 01:07:27.677
Yeah everybody loves that song man.
It was number one in the country.

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:29.045
I stole it.

01:07:29.128 --> 01:07:31.005
No.

01:07:31.088 --> 01:07:32.840
It's true.

01:07:32.923 --> 01:07:37.178
My mom wrote it on a napkin three weeks
before she died and I stole it.

01:07:37.803 --> 01:07:39.638
That song bought me this franchise...

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:42.016
and the hottest wife in the world...

01:07:42.099 --> 01:07:45.352
but it's all fake.

01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:50.649
Well... Well look you can write another
song. I know it's in your bones. Right?

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:54.070
Don't be crazy. I can't write a song
as brilliant as Love Me Sexy.

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:56.072
You're right.

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:58.491

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:27.509
- Watch when you roll over.
- OK.

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:29.553
Watch. OK here we go.

01:12:29.636 --> 01:12:31.347
- Oh my God.
- Oh ho.

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:34.683
OK.

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:38.354
If I could have
everyone's attention please.

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:40.439
Uh well...

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:44.276
I just wanted to take one last time
to say thank you to all of you...

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:49.031
for all your hard work
as part of the Flint Tropics.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.829
My teammates it was an honor
to be on the court with you.

01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:57.956
You guys are the best.

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:03.087
Even you, Vakidis.
Goddamn dumb son of a bitch.

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:06.423
You don't understand
a word I'm saying do you?

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:10.427
To the Tropic Ball Girls...

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:12.197
I always thought I was gonna sleep
with a couple of you...

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:14.807
but ha ha that... that didn't happen.

01:13:17.184 --> 01:13:19.436
That'll teach me to procrastinate.

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:24.066
Bobby Dee,
you're like a son I never had.

01:13:24.983 --> 01:13:29.113
The son who's exactly
the same age as me.

01:13:29.196 --> 01:13:32.533
Well kinda... You're like
a half-son half-friend.

01:13:32.616 --> 01:13:34.952
Friend. A son-friend.

01:13:35.035 --> 01:13:40.582
No don't talk. You'll just make it worse.
I don't want to cry and wet my pants.

01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:44.837
I'm not makin'
a whole lot of sense right now.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.797
Um...

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.632
Hunh...

01:13:48.715 --> 01:13:49.758
- Jackie?
- Yeah?

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:52.428
- Can I say a couple words?
- Please.

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:54.513
Thanks.

01:13:58.225 --> 01:14:02.020
So we all know
that Clarence got traded...

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:06.024
and we all know this game
doesn't really matter anymore right?

01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:07.985
I've been thinking...

01:14:09.361 --> 01:14:12.156
We made it our mission
to win fourth place.

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:18.829
You know fourth place is still out there
waiting for us to take it.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.124
And we're this close.

01:14:22.916 --> 01:14:28.130
Now I... I tried to... to pretend that
it didn't matter if we won fourth or not.

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:31.175
The truth is...

01:14:34.803 --> 01:14:39.641
I never wanted anything
more in my whole fucked-up life.

01:14:40.517 --> 01:14:42.561
This game does matter.

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:43.562
It matters...

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:49.193
because this is the last real game of
basketball any of us is ever gonna play.

01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:50.986
Ever.

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:56.283
Saturday night I say we leave it
all out there on the floor...

01:14:56.366 --> 01:14:59.828
because there is nothing else
for us to save it for.

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:06.001
Clarence or no Clarence
NBA or no NBA...

01:15:08.545 --> 01:15:10.339
this is for us.

01:15:16.428 --> 01:15:18.430
Yeah. Let's do this.

01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:21.934
Jackie Moon I believe you have
one more game to promote.

01:15:22.017 --> 01:15:24.394
- That's right.
- Damn right.

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:27.022
- Huh? Gentlemen?
- Let's bring it in.

01:15:27.105 --> 01:15:28.607
- Ladies?
- C'mon.

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:31.818
- Yeah.
- Let's go Tropics.

01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:34.571
- Let me hear you say "Fourth place!"
- Fourth place!

01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:36.573
- Fourth place!
- Fourth place!

01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:38.534
- Fourth place!
- Fourth place!

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:40.744
- Fourth place!
- Fourth place!

01:15:40.827 --> 01:15:40.910
Look, the Spurs may be
the number-one team in the league...

01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:43.664
Look, the Spurs may be
the number-one team in the league...

01:15:43.747 --> 01:15:47.251
but come Saturday night
they're gonna have to prove it.

01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:48.752
Turtleneck.

01:15:48.835 --> 01:15:52.631
Mr. Moon since this game
doesn't actually count...

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:54.299
what exactly is your motivation?

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:59.596
On Saturday we're gonna be playing
for the Flint, Michigan Megabowl.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.139
White pants.

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:03.576
Yeah I don't know if I understand
what you mean by Megabowl?

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.769
It's a Megabowl.
What's not to understand?

01:16:05.852 --> 01:16:06.913
This is history in the making.

01:16:06.937 --> 01:16:11.733
You're gonna wanna tell your grandkids
and their grandkids and their grandkids.

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:14.278
And when they look back
in the "anals" of history...

01:16:14.361 --> 01:16:16.321
they're gonna be talkin'
about three things...

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:19.866
discovery of fire,
invention of the submarine...

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:21.410
and the Flint Michigan Megabowl.

01:16:21.493 --> 01:16:23.245
Right but still the game doesn't count.

01:16:23.328 --> 01:16:28.000
The trophy's 12 feet high.
And it is glorious. I've seen it.

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:30.168
Oh yeah and... and when
we win the game...

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:31.962
uh that big gun's gonna shoot off.

01:16:32.045 --> 01:16:34.631
The cannon doesn't actually fire.
It's a relic.

01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:36.174
We're gonna win the Megabowl.

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:38.885
Saturday! Eight o'clock!

01:16:38.969 --> 01:16:40.762
Flint Michigan Megabowl!

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:44.891
Flint Michigan Megabowl!
Flint Michigan Megabowl!

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:46.786
Fourth place! Fourth place!

01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:48.729
The Tropics seem to have captured
every heart...

01:16:48.812 --> 01:16:50.355
in this town of underdogs.

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:52.125
People have poured in
from around the state...

01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:55.944
to root for this first Megabowl
championship.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:57.964
- Fourth place! Fourth place!
- It's a wonderful night for Flint...

01:16:57.988 --> 01:17:00.699
and a wonderful night
for the Flint Fairgrounds Coliseum.

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:05.203
Now Flint will be playing
without Coffee Black their top scorer...

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:11.209
as the Spurs have traded for several
new players from around the ABA.

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:15.756
I was excited to be here
till I saw your face Coffee.

01:17:27.225 --> 01:17:30.937
Why's it so quiet in here?
Somebody say somethin'!

01:17:32.397 --> 01:17:34.524
Monix what time is it?

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:36.902
It's time.

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:53.251
It is a sold-out crowd here
at the Flint Fairgrounds Coliseum

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:56.088
as the Tropics walk onto the court.

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:58.840
I tell you what, Dick,
this makes a lot of sense...

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:02.260
this heroes' welcome
for this Flint Tropics team.

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:03.929
This is extraordinary.

01:18:04.012 --> 01:18:06.765
Jackie Moon
is Flint's favorite son...

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:09.518
and he has done more for this city...

01:18:09.601 --> 01:18:12.896
than any human being
who's ever lived on this planet!

01:18:12.979 --> 01:18:17.526
With the possible exception
of, uh, Henry Ford...

01:18:17.609 --> 01:18:20.946
Jackie Moon has done a lot for this city
you're right about that.

01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:35.627
Good tip to the Spurs.
Behind the back.

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:38.004
And wow! A little "How do you do?"
from Markie.

01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:40.298
That's a pretty impressive start
for the Spurs.

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:43.218
Running roughshod over the Tropics.

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:48.390
Vakidis passes to Doubleday.

01:18:48.473 --> 01:18:50.058
Oh! Rejected.

01:18:51.017 --> 01:18:52.686
Scootsie passes to Jackie.

01:18:52.769 --> 01:18:54.479
Out to Twiggy and...

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:56.523
Oh stolen by Rebenkoff.

01:18:56.606 --> 01:18:57.686
He pulls up for a dagger...

01:18:57.733 --> 01:18:59.609
and ouch three points.

01:18:59.693 --> 01:19:01.445
Yeah!

01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:05.991
Yeah I don't feel good about this.
I may not have brought enough Scotch.

01:19:06.074 --> 01:19:08.702
Oh shit!

01:19:08.785 --> 01:19:10.328
Oh!

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:13.498
It's hard to say where the Tropics
are falling down worse tonight...

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.333
on defense or on offense.

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:18.795
And with Coffee Black on
the Spurs bench the Tropics look lost.

01:19:18.879 --> 01:19:20.672
You're goin' in Coffee Black.

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:23.633
Coach I've got back spasms.
I... I can't do it.

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:26.678
Lutz you're in.

01:19:30.223 --> 01:19:31.516
Jackie! C'mon. Jackie Jackie!

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.226
Moon to Ellis.

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:34.478
Ellis to Munson.

01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:36.772
Munson to Monix.

01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:39.524
Ooh three points! Monix responds!

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.443
But it will take more than
one fancy three...

01:19:41.526 --> 01:19:43.653
to defeat these mighty Spurs.

01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:49.576
This is easily the worst half
of basketball the Tropics have played...

01:19:49.659 --> 01:19:51.369
since Monix took over as coach.

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:55.081
- Yeah it's a shit-fuckin'-sandwich Dick.
- Oh, let's watch the F-bomb, Lou.

01:19:55.165 --> 01:19:56.725
With time expiring in the first half...

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:59.586
Monix splits the screen
with a pass to Moon.

01:19:59.669 --> 01:20:00.796
He goes up strong...

01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:02.547
Oh! Gets taken out by Petrelli.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:05.884
I don't think I've ever seen anyone
get taken out quite that hard before.

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:08.720
This looks serious.

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:10.931
Monix you gotta hit him in the nuts!

01:20:11.014 --> 01:20:13.850
Father Pat breaking up what
could have been total pandemonium.

01:20:13.934 --> 01:20:16.812
- Come on.
- Jackie? Jackie.

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:19.731
- Come on back to the bench.
- Jackie? Oh.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:21.358
He's got a pulse.

01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:24.277
Let's get the stretcher.

01:20:24.361 --> 01:20:27.155
- We don't have a stretcher.
- Jackie sold it.

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:28.925
- All right well let's get him up.
- Yeah come on.

01:20:28.949 --> 01:20:30.343
Let's get him in the locker room
guys. Hurry.

01:20:30.367 --> 01:20:31.535
Come on come on.

01:20:31.618 --> 01:20:35.413
Jackie's teammates doing just
an awful job of stabilizing his spine...

01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:37.290
as they carry him off the court.

01:20:37.374 --> 01:20:39.543
Come on Jackie.

01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:03.107
Yeah!

01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:04.210
Where the hell
do you think you're goin'?

01:21:04.234 --> 01:21:05.527
Coffee!

01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:08.196
You walk away from this team
you will never play in the NBA.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.198
That's my son! That's my son!

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:12.826
- Go Clarence! Go Clarence!
- You hear me Coffee?

01:21:12.909 --> 01:21:16.246
Look at this. Coffee Black
is walking over to the Tropics.

01:21:16.329 --> 01:21:19.124
This crowd is going crazy!

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:23.460
Come on Jackie wake up.

01:21:23.461 --> 01:21:25.547
Come on Jackie wake up.

01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:27.799
Jackie come on
it's me it's Bobby Dee.

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:29.885
Wake up. Come on open 'em up.

01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:32.971
- Hey you got any smelling salt?
- I think we do.

01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:35.599
- Get up.
- Jackie.

01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:37.475
Come on Jackie.

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:39.811
- Snap out of it. Hey.
- Come on baby.

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:41.062
Jackie.

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:45.901
Mom.

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:50.989
- I miss you, Mama.
- I miss you too honey.

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:54.868
- Come on little fella. Jackie.
- Jackie.

01:21:54.951 --> 01:21:56.912
Clarence what are you doin' here?

01:21:56.995 --> 01:22:00.624
What it look like?
I'm wit' y'all. He a'ight?

01:22:00.707 --> 01:22:03.877
Are you outta your mind?
You wanna lose your NBA contract?

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:08.381
I don't care nothin' about that man. This
is our season and we gonna finish it.

01:22:08.465 --> 01:22:10.175
So you're gonna blow the deal for this?

01:22:10.258 --> 01:22:13.011
- Fourth place right?
- Right.

01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:15.138
- Let's get Tropical.
- Right on.

01:22:15.221 --> 01:22:17.390
Come on buddy. Come around.

01:22:18.391 --> 01:22:20.101
Now I want you to go forward...

01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:23.438
and tell the others
what I have told you here today.

01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:25.190
Do you understand me son?

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:27.651
Yes Mama. You're so kind.

01:22:28.652 --> 01:22:30.320
I'm sorry I stole your song.

01:22:30.403 --> 01:22:33.239
Oh I forgave you for that a long time ago.

01:22:33.323 --> 01:22:36.618
Jackie it's time you forgave yourself.

01:22:37.661 --> 01:22:40.705
I don't wanna leave this place.
It's so fluffy.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:44.584
Now hurry up
and don't forget what I said.

01:22:44.668 --> 01:22:46.795
OK. Bye!

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:50.215
Bye Mama. Bye.

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:52.050
Bye.

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:54.803
Oh hey... I threw up Mom.

01:22:54.886 --> 01:22:57.430
I know you did sweetie.

01:22:57.514 --> 01:22:59.808
I threw up all by myself!

01:23:02.519 --> 01:23:03.996
- That's workin'.
- Here we go. Come on Jackie.

01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:06.064
A little eye flutter. Hello fella!

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:07.732
- Hey there!
- Mornin' sunshine.

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:08.942
We missed ya.

01:23:09.025 --> 01:23:10.402
Oh this just in.

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:13.905
It sounds like Jackie Moon is up
and around the Tropics locker room.

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:18.451
Then fake the pass and go straight
to the basket. Twiggy how hard is it?

01:23:18.535 --> 01:23:20.620
He keeps throwin' elbows.
What do you want me to do?

01:23:20.704 --> 01:23:23.081
I want you to stand up to him
ya pussy.

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:26.543
Monix wait. I gotta tell
these guys somethin'.

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:29.587
I had a dream.

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:32.257
I had a dream I was in heaven.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.884
And my mother spoke to me.

01:23:34.968 --> 01:23:36.636
She was wearing
this flowing white gown...

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:40.515
and she showed me
a brand-new way to score a basket.

01:23:40.598 --> 01:23:43.435
She called it the alley oop.

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:50.650
She spoke to me and she said
"With this gift you will win fourth place."

01:23:57.699 --> 01:24:00.243
We are back in action here
at the Megabowl.

01:24:00.326 --> 01:24:03.538
Coffee Black is playing for the Tropics.

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:09.335
Jackie makes the start here.

01:24:09.419 --> 01:24:13.131
In fact it looks like
he's running the offense.

01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:55.215
What was that?

01:24:55.298 --> 01:24:57.842
I'm sorry I don't know
what just happened.

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:02.305
A very unusual series of moves
just made the ball go in.

01:25:05.266 --> 01:25:06.726
Damn.

01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:10.396
Yeah I don't know why Dick
but I just got an erection.

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:11.648
Oh.

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:17.862
Foul. No two fouls.

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:20.949
Foul?! I didn't touch anybody.

01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:23.094
Look Jackie people can't just
go flyin' in the air like that.

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:25.453
Oh, please. My mom
wouldn't cheat in my dreams.

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:27.789
- What?
- She's an angel!

01:25:27.872 --> 01:25:29.791
Heaven wants us to win this game!

01:25:29.874 --> 01:25:32.274
- I'll burn your house down!
- Oh, hold it, hold it, hold it.

01:25:32.335 --> 01:25:35.130
It can't be a foul without
touchin' another player.

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:38.591
And it can't be traveling without
first establishing a pivot foot.

01:25:38.675 --> 01:25:40.552
- That's right.
- It's two points Father Pat.

01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:41.970
It is two points.

01:25:45.765 --> 01:25:49.018
- All right I'm gonna allow it.
- That's the gospel.

01:25:49.102 --> 01:25:51.229
Two points Flint.

01:25:51.312 --> 01:25:52.647
Are you outta your mind?

01:25:52.730 --> 01:25:54.834
- He was floating. Is this ghost ball?
- It's legal, Coach.

01:25:54.858 --> 01:25:56.377
- It's legal Coach.
- What the hell is that?

01:25:56.401 --> 01:25:58.236
Yeah!

01:25:58.319 --> 01:26:00.572
It worked Jackie!

01:26:00.655 --> 01:26:03.491
Thanks Mama! Whoo!

01:26:03.575 --> 01:26:06.035
Things are getting interesting
here in the second half.

01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:09.122
It's the Spurs' ball
as Rebenkoff makes a shot.

01:26:09.205 --> 01:26:11.666
Misses it. Rebound Tropics.

01:26:15.044 --> 01:26:16.044
There it is again.

01:26:16.087 --> 01:26:19.465
Clarence leaping and forcing the ball in
a downward direction through the net...

01:26:19.549 --> 01:26:21.593
off of a high arching pass.

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:22.987
- It's a great play.
- It sure is.

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:27.724
Hold on. I'm just being told
that this is called an alley oop!

01:26:27.807 --> 01:26:29.309
Yes that is easier to say.

01:26:29.392 --> 01:26:31.019
Twig!

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:33.521
Monix passes to Jackie.

01:26:33.605 --> 01:26:34.689
Jackie lobs to Clarence.

01:26:34.772 --> 01:26:36.608
And then yes! Another alley oop.

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:38.443
The Spurs don't know what's hit 'em.

01:26:38.526 --> 01:26:40.778
- I love the alley oop!
- Ha ha!

01:26:44.407 --> 01:26:45.658
Yes! Yeah!

01:26:47.118 --> 01:26:49.662
I wanna take you higher

01:26:51.915 --> 01:26:54.125
I wanna take you higher

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:55.209
Here comes the alley.

01:26:55.251 --> 01:26:57.378
And there goes the oop!

01:27:07.263 --> 01:27:08.388
Timeout white.

01:27:08.389 --> 01:27:08.765
Timeout white.

01:27:08.848 --> 01:27:12.018
In all my years of radio
I've never seen anything like this.

01:27:12.101 --> 01:27:15.188
The Tropics have fought their way back
from a huge deficit...

01:27:15.271 --> 01:27:18.816
and now with 12 seconds left
in the history of this franchise...

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:22.737
they are down by two,
and man you can feel the tension.

01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:25.073
OK, guys, listen up.
They've made adjustments.

01:27:25.156 --> 01:27:27.825
We can't keep runnin' the alley oop.
They're keying on Clarence.

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:30.161
So we're not gonna run the alley oop.

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:32.830
- What the hell we gonna run then?
- The puke.

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:34.040
The puke?

01:27:34.123 --> 01:27:37.168
Don't tell me you've forgotten it.
I seared it into your brains.

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:40.838
- This will work OK? The puke.
- Right on.

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:42.799
I was gonna say exactly the same thing.

01:27:42.882 --> 01:27:45.885
Good call. "Let's get Tropical" on three.
One two three.

01:27:45.969 --> 01:27:48.054
Let's get Tropical!

01:27:48.137 --> 01:27:49.597
We're down to the last play.

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:51.015
Monix inbounds to Jackie.

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:53.017
Jackie passes right back to Monix.

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:54.852
Monix back to Jackie.

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:57.438
The Tropics have gotta
make a move here Dick.

01:27:57.522 --> 01:27:59.857
Yeah they need to find a way
to the hole and fast.

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:03.194
Monix finds Bee Bee.
Back door to Jackie. He goes up strong...

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:06.322
- Ooh! Fouled hard by Petrelli!
- Eat shit Petrelli!

01:28:06.406 --> 01:28:08.032
Don't you know
how to play basketball?

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:11.744
Father Pat struggles to keep order...

01:28:11.828 --> 01:28:14.455
between these two tough
competitive teams.

01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:18.459
All right. Black. Four-two.
With the body. Two shots.

01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:21.671
- Come on Jackie!
- Jackie will shoot two free throws here.

01:28:21.754 --> 01:28:25.133
His team down by two
with two seconds left on the clock.

01:28:25.216 --> 01:28:28.928
All right, gentlemen.
Relax on the first one we got two here.

01:28:29.012 --> 01:28:31.222
Come on Jackie.

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:34.976
Don't worry guys. I got these.
I'm very good at free throws.

01:28:35.059 --> 01:28:39.314
Seriously free throws are probably
the best facet of my game.

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:42.233
Whew.

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:44.986
- Whew.
- What the hell are you doin' Jackie?

01:28:45.069 --> 01:28:47.572
What, you never see me
shoot free throws before?

01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:50.074
He's shootin' granny style.
Let 'im do his thing.

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:51.576
Always has.

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:53.661
- Ah shit.
- Whew.

01:28:54.662 --> 01:28:56.205
Whew. Here we go.

01:28:57.832 --> 01:29:01.919
Jackie Moon holding the fate of Flint
in his fingertips.

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:04.797
- He kisses the ball for good luck.
- Whew. Sweet sugar.

01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:10.511
It's good!

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:13.848
- Ha ha ha! Yes!
- Never doubted you Jackie. Come on.

01:29:13.931 --> 01:29:16.100
The Tropics need one more
to stay alive.

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:18.019
Watch the lines. Move on the release.

01:29:18.102 --> 01:29:21.898
- Go Jackie!
- One more Jackie.

01:29:21.981 --> 01:29:23.024
Whew.

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.570
