01:31.858 --> 01:33.018
Whoa!

01:42.535 --> 01:44.196
All the food's gonna go bad.

01:46.873 --> 01:48.135
Yeah, I drew up a list.

01:48.208 --> 01:51.473
I'll hit the store
before it gets all bought out.

01:54.214 --> 01:55.203
Fuck.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.749
- Can you save it?
- No. No way.

01:57.817 --> 02:00.411
No, I gotta start over from scratch.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.751
I'll call the studio
when the phones get back up,

02:02.822 --> 02:04.414
see if they can extend my deadline.

02:05.658 --> 02:07.319
What choice do they have?

02:09.996 --> 02:10.985
You kiddin'?

02:11.064 --> 02:13.897
They could whip up some bad
Photoshop poster in an afternoon.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.231
They do it all the time.
Two big heads.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.202
I should have brought it downstairs
with me last night.

02:18.271 --> 02:19.932
Just stupid, I guess.

02:20.006 --> 02:21.997
Well, sweetie,
you couldn't exactly know

02:22.075 --> 02:24.009
that a tree was gonna come flying
through the window.

02:24.077 --> 02:25.510
Yeah, I'll hit the hardware store too,

02:25.578 --> 02:27.136
get some plastic sheeting
and duct tape

02:27.213 --> 02:29.374
and seal this up
before it gets dark, you know.

02:29.449 --> 02:31.041
Order in some new glass.

02:32.519 --> 02:33.850
Oh, you know what?
That was your--

02:33.920 --> 02:36.480
that was your grandfather's tree,
the one he planted.

02:36.556 --> 02:39.286
- Ohh.
- Used to play in that tree.

02:39.359 --> 02:40.519
It's just stuff, though.

02:40.593 --> 02:43.118
You know, we're safe.
That's all that counts.

02:43.196 --> 02:44.356
Yeah.

02:44.430 --> 02:45.920
Mom, Dad, you gotta come see!

02:45.999 --> 02:47.728
Hey, Billy, take it easy,
all right?

02:47.800 --> 02:49.529
I really don't want you running
all over the place.

02:49.602 --> 02:50.694
But you gotta come look.

02:50.770 --> 02:53.762
The boathouse is all bashed!
Holy crap!

02:53.840 --> 02:55.000
Billy.

02:55.074 --> 02:58.134
Sorry, Mom, but you just
gotta come! Come on!

02:58.211 --> 02:59.576
Whoa!

02:59.746 --> 03:01.077
Whoa.

03:01.147 --> 03:03.081
- Whoa.
- Come on.

03:03.149 --> 03:05.083
Having spoken,
the Doomsayer departs.

03:05.151 --> 03:07.745
Come on!

03:07.820 --> 03:09.811
How do you two always manage
to make me laugh?

03:10.823 --> 03:13.553
- You have incredibly low standards.
- Mm-hmm.

03:13.626 --> 03:16.652
Let's go, uh, see the damage.

03:16.729 --> 03:17.718
No.

03:22.669 --> 03:24.728
- Norton's tree.
- Yeah.

03:26.339 --> 03:28.273
You mean the dead one
I've been asking him

03:28.341 --> 03:30.502
to take down for three years
before it finally blew over?

03:30.577 --> 03:31.566
That tree?

03:32.745 --> 03:35.805
- Really got smooshed.
- You ain't kiddin'.

03:37.183 --> 03:38.878
Look at that.

03:41.187 --> 03:42.313
What is it, Daddy?

03:43.323 --> 03:44.312
Mist.

03:45.858 --> 03:48.759
- On the lake?
- We've had mist on the lake before.

03:48.828 --> 03:50.762
Coming off the mountain like that?

03:50.830 --> 03:53.321
Two fronts meeting,

03:53.399 --> 03:55.629
left over from the storm,
something like that.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.192
You sure?

03:57.270 --> 03:58.703
Honey, I'm not the weatherman.

03:58.771 --> 04:00.932
Why don't you take Billy,
get him dressed.

04:01.007 --> 04:02.338
I'll take him to town with me.

04:02.408 --> 04:03.807
Okay. Where you going?

04:03.876 --> 04:06.970
I'm gonna go have a little chat
with our neighbor about his tree.

04:07.046 --> 04:08.138
Hon.

04:08.214 --> 04:10.205
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
punch him in the nose.

04:10.283 --> 04:11.614
You know what he's gonna say.

04:11.684 --> 04:14.710
He's gonna say, "Sue me,"
which, I don't know, maybe we should.

04:14.787 --> 04:17.584
Honey, one property dispute
with this guy

04:17.656 --> 04:19.089
is enough to last me a lifetime.

04:19.158 --> 04:21.820
I'm gonna ask
for his insurance information.

04:21.894 --> 04:22.883
Okay.

04:22.962 --> 04:24.953
- That's all.
- Yeah.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.495
Ohh!
Mother fucker!

04:33.673 --> 04:35.140
Aw, shit!

04:35.208 --> 04:37.676
Ohh, you mother fucker!

04:39.012 --> 04:40.001
Cock sucker!

04:42.181 --> 04:43.170
"Turn on.

04:43.249 --> 04:45.444
"Full choke.

04:45.518 --> 04:47.679
Pull five... choke."

04:52.125 --> 04:53.615
I guess you've seen the--

04:55.194 --> 04:56.183
boathouse.

04:56.262 --> 04:57.593
Yeah, and--?

04:57.664 --> 04:59.291
Nothin'.

04:59.365 --> 05:02.698
Just think we should trade
insurance info, you know?.

05:02.769 --> 05:03.758
That's all.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.963
Oh, my insurance guy's
gonna love me.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.176
Oh.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.237
Shit. The 1980.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.180
I was gonna bring
the station wagon, but...

05:18.651 --> 05:20.482
I don't know, the weather was
so beautiful coming out of New York,

05:20.553 --> 05:22.783
I just--
You know, top down.

05:22.855 --> 05:24.584
I'm sorry, man. I mean it.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.147
Sincerely.

05:27.827 --> 05:30.523
- That's nice of you to say.
- No, that car was cherry.

05:30.596 --> 05:32.223
I hate to see it like that.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.658
Okay, I'll tell you what,

05:36.736 --> 05:39.534
I'll find my insurance guy's number,
I'll bring it by later.

05:39.605 --> 05:41.163
- That okay?
- No problem.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.502
So, uh, David--

05:50.350 --> 05:53.683
you're not heading into town today
by any chance, are you?

06:08.634 --> 06:10.295
Well, CMP's out in force.

06:11.637 --> 06:12.797
Maybe we'll get our power back.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.897
I know. Some storm, huh?

06:14.974 --> 06:16.271
One for the books, yeah.

06:16.342 --> 06:18.003
For a moment there last night,

06:18.077 --> 06:20.511
I thought we were gonna take off
and head for Oz.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.639
WZON is off the air,

06:22.715 --> 06:24.945
but Portland's still broadcasting.

06:25.017 --> 06:26.006
Daddy, look.

06:26.586 --> 06:27.917
Ah.

06:27.987 --> 06:29.852
Guys from the base.

06:29.922 --> 06:31.480
- From up the mountain?
- Uh-huh.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.149
The Arrowhead Project?

06:34.994 --> 06:35.983
Well, you're a local.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.825
Any idea what they do up there?

06:37.897 --> 06:39.387
Missile defense research.

06:39.465 --> 06:41.296
You know, I'm sure
you've heard the stories.

06:41.367 --> 06:42.356
Oh, sure.

06:42.435 --> 06:44.835
The woman at the Laundromat
says that, uh,

06:44.904 --> 06:47.998
they have a crashed flying saucer
up there with frozen alien bodies.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.837
Right. Miss Edna. Yeah.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.503
Miss Tabloid.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.240
"I Had Bigfoot's Baby."

06:56.516 --> 06:59.076
"Satan's Face Appears
in Oil Well Fire."

06:59.152 --> 07:00.483
You know, real reliable stuff.

07:05.224 --> 07:06.714
Well, they're in a hurry.

07:06.793 --> 07:08.454
Maybe their power's out too.

07:17.703 --> 07:18.692
Huh. Still no signal.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.968
Why don't you go ahead?
I'm gonna try Steph on a pay phone.

07:22.041 --> 07:23.736
Can I go with Mr. Norton, Daddy?

07:23.810 --> 07:26.608
Sure, if you promise
to hold his hand, I guess.

07:26.679 --> 07:27.668
Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:27.747 --> 07:29.339
Here's a list.

07:29.415 --> 07:30.746
- Sure.
- Okay?

07:30.817 --> 07:32.011
Meet you guys in there.

07:34.086 --> 07:35.075
Hold hands.

07:38.925 --> 07:41.189
I'm sorry. I didn't know
it was your sister.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.724
That looks so freaky!

07:47.800 --> 07:48.789
Hmm.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.234
- Sally, hey.
- Hey, Mr. Drayton.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.869
You guys look jammed up.

07:59.946 --> 08:03.074
Yeah, well, half the staff
didn't show, plus the power's out.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.481
Oh, no. What,
no backup generator?

08:05.551 --> 08:07.041
Only to keep the food cold.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.677
Everything else,
welcome to the Dark Ages,

08:08.754 --> 08:09.846
and bring your checkbook.

08:09.922 --> 08:12.413
Hey, Thursday night,
Steph and I want a date night.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.926
- Baby-sit?
- Heck, yeah. I'm there.

08:16.462 --> 08:17.554
Oh, my God.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.120
The storm.

08:19.198 --> 08:22.292
Everybody's stockin' up.
Been like this since we opened.

08:22.368 --> 08:23.528
Crappy day, huh?

08:23.603 --> 08:26.094
Eh, everyone's a little
pissed off this morning.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.003
'Morning, Mrs. Carmody.

08:29.141 --> 08:31.735
With lines like these,
I don't know how good it is,

08:31.811 --> 08:34.041
but I guess we'll have to make do.

08:34.981 --> 08:37.506
- Keep your head down, pal.
- I know it.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.308
Hey, champ.

08:43.489 --> 08:44.820
Your wife should be a doctor.

08:44.891 --> 08:47.052
She could make a fortune
in Manhattan with this handwriting.

08:47.126 --> 08:49.924
Yeah, it takes some getting used to.

08:49.996 --> 08:52.157
Why don't you get your stuff?
I'll meet you at the checkout.

08:52.231 --> 08:53.220
Okay, done.

08:56.002 --> 08:59.130
Hey, David,
thanks for helping me out today.

09:02.942 --> 09:04.933
Are you and Mr. Norton
gonna be friends now, Daddy?

09:05.011 --> 09:06.535
Oh, I don't know.

09:07.947 --> 09:09.938
"Friends" might be stretching it a little.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.316
I guess you're not mad
at each other anymore.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.375
I guess not.

09:16.122 --> 09:17.783
And that's a start, huh?

09:18.824 --> 09:20.815
I'm sorry, ma'am,
the registers are down.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.884
The power outage got us too.

09:22.962 --> 09:25.624
Hopefully we'll have
power up pretty soon.

09:35.474 --> 09:38.170
- The bus leaves in 30 minutes.
- We'll make it, okay?

09:38.244 --> 09:40.235
You guys get the goodies.
I'll wait in line.

09:45.651 --> 09:47.585
I need some change
on register five.

09:49.221 --> 09:51.246
Good morning, Ms. Reppler.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.586
Hello, Ms. Reppler.

09:52.658 --> 09:55.821
Well, hello to you, Billy Drayton.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.556
How'd you hold up in the storm?

09:57.630 --> 09:59.791
We had a tree come through
the picture window last night,

09:59.865 --> 10:01.025
right in my studio.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.069
And the boathouse got all smooshed.
Mr. Norton's tree fell on it.

10:04.136 --> 10:05.125
Ouch.

10:05.204 --> 10:07.695
- Yeah.
Sorry to hear that.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.941
How'd you guys make out?

10:12.011 --> 10:15.174
Oh, we're fine.
It's the listings I'm worried about.

10:15.247 --> 10:18.080
At the very least, I'll bet every one
of our "For Sale" signs fell over.

10:18.150 --> 10:20.812
We had damage
at the school, wouldn't you know?.

10:20.886 --> 10:23.878
That's what we get for not fixing
that roof when we should've,

10:23.956 --> 10:27.483
but with funds being cut every year...

10:27.560 --> 10:29.027
You'd think educating children

10:29.095 --> 10:31.290
would be more
of a priority in this country,

10:31.364 --> 10:33.457
but you'd be wrong.

10:33.532 --> 10:36.660
Government's got better things
to spend our money on,

10:36.736 --> 10:40.399
like corporate handouts
and building bombs.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.544
Daddy, is there a fire?
Is Mommy all right?

10:55.621 --> 10:58.419
I'm sure she's fine.
Don't worry, okay?

10:59.492 --> 11:00.982
Mind what you're doing, Sally.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.588
Oh, come on,
we got 10 days' leave.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.687
Check our papers.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.755
Look, I told you,
all leaves are cancelled.

11:06.832 --> 11:07.821
I don't know why.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.891
I gotta go check the pharmacy out.

11:09.969 --> 11:12.437
Three men meet me
back at the Jeep in five minutes.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.494
That's an order.

11:16.008 --> 11:19.500
Shit, man! Another half an hour,
and we'd have been gone.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.304
Oh, my God!

12:02.621 --> 12:03.986
Something in the mist!

12:04.056 --> 12:05.921
Something in the mist...

12:05.991 --> 12:07.481
...took John Lee!

12:07.560 --> 12:08.891
Dan, catch your breath.

12:08.961 --> 12:10.826
Something in the mist took John Lee.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.659
I could hear him screaming.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.667
Shut the doors! Shut the doors!
My God!

12:15.735 --> 12:17.396
Daddy, I'm scared.
Can we go home?

12:21.907 --> 12:22.896
Don't go out there.

12:22.975 --> 12:25.205
There's something in the mist.
It took John Lee.

12:25.277 --> 12:27.768
Screw that!
I'm gettin' in my car.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.337
Mister, no!

13:01.614 --> 13:03.104
Please hold me.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.173
It's okay, it's okay.

13:05.251 --> 13:09.381
It's a pollution cloud.
The mills down in Rumford.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.549
Some kind of chemical explosion.
Has to be.

13:13.926 --> 13:15.416
What is it?

13:16.662 --> 13:18.152
What's going on?

13:21.333 --> 13:22.493
It's death.

13:23.569 --> 13:24.558
Aah!

13:57.303 --> 13:59.703
Stay down!

14:00.906 --> 14:02.066
Daddy!

14:09.815 --> 14:11.043
You okay?

14:21.260 --> 14:22.750
That was an earthquake.

14:23.762 --> 14:26.060
I tell you, the goddamn mills blew up!

14:26.131 --> 14:29.589
Is everyone okay?
Is anyone hurt?

14:29.668 --> 14:32.967
Everybody just stay put, okay?
Just stay inside the store.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.905
I can't. I can't stay here.
I gotta get home to my kids.

14:35.975 --> 14:39.069
No.
No, don't go out there.

14:39.144 --> 14:41.942
It's death out there.
It's the end of days.

14:42.014 --> 14:44.039
Stop it, okay? Stop it.

14:44.116 --> 14:46.949
Please, everybody,
everybody just relax, okay?

14:47.019 --> 14:49.010
He's right. Let's just stay cool.

14:49.088 --> 14:50.487
Let's just try to figure out
what happened.

14:50.556 --> 14:54.925
I'm sorry, I-- I can't just stay here.
I have to get home to my kids.

14:54.994 --> 14:56.894
Ma'am, no, you can't go out there.

14:56.962 --> 14:58.657
Could be a poisonous gas cloud.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.221
Didn't you hear that man screaming?

15:00.299 --> 15:02.961
I agree. Let's stay here
until we figure it out.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.400
You're not listening!

15:04.970 --> 15:06.665
I can't stay here.

15:07.806 --> 15:11.640
Wanda's looking after little Victor.
She's only 8.

15:11.710 --> 15:15.578
Sometimes she forgets
she's supposed to be watching him.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.913
I told them I'd only be gone
a few minutes.

15:23.155 --> 15:25.419
She's only 8.

15:26.492 --> 15:27.925
For their sakes,

15:27.993 --> 15:29.324
don't.

15:34.499 --> 15:37.024
Well, isn't anybody gonna help me?

15:39.672 --> 15:41.503
Shh. It's okay, pal.

15:42.708 --> 15:45.199
Won't somebody here
see a lady home?

15:50.182 --> 15:51.376
You?

15:59.024 --> 16:00.048
You?

16:09.635 --> 16:11.796
It's okay, buddy.
- You?

16:11.870 --> 16:15.169
Ma'am, please,
I got my own boy to worry about.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.810
I hope you all rot in hell.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.075
Ma'am, please, wait until--

16:59.184 --> 17:01.744
Okay,
let's start cleaning up, okay?

17:01.820 --> 17:04.482
Get the spilled bottles,
broken glass, stuff like that.

17:04.556 --> 17:07.218
Aisle three has medical supplies.

17:07.291 --> 17:10.125
It's okay. It's okay.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.890
All right, easy, champ.
Come on.

17:11.964 --> 17:12.953
Come on.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.694
Come on.
All right, hey, hey, hey.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.429
Can't keep crying like this, pal.

17:17.502 --> 17:18.834
Come on!

17:18.904 --> 17:20.895
Come on,
you're gonna hurt yourself.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.305
- Come on, are you all right?
- I want Mommy!

17:23.375 --> 17:24.865
All right, I know you want Mommy.

17:24.943 --> 17:27.411
All right, just try to breathe.

17:27.479 --> 17:28.810
Just try to breathe, okay?

17:30.315 --> 17:32.146
Just try to breathe, pal.
That's okay.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.878
It's all right.

17:36.488 --> 17:39.582
I haven't seen him suck his thumb
like this since he was 2 years old.

17:39.658 --> 17:41.455
He's in shock.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.256
I think we all are.

17:43.328 --> 17:44.693
You haven't met.

17:45.164 --> 17:46.597
Amanda Dunfrey.

17:46.665 --> 17:48.826
She's new in town
as of this semester.

17:49.835 --> 17:51.325
Teaches third grade

17:51.403 --> 17:54.668
and the special ed kids,
now that Mosher's retired.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.674
She's wonderful.
The kids love her.

17:57.676 --> 17:59.837
And David's an artist.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.881
He does movie posters and such.

18:02.948 --> 18:03.937
And me...

18:04.516 --> 18:09.419
Lord, I'm babbling away
like some old biddy at a tea party!

18:09.488 --> 18:10.978
My nerves are jangled, I guess.

18:11.056 --> 18:12.284
Boy settle down?

18:12.357 --> 18:13.847
How is he?

18:13.926 --> 18:14.984
Still hot.

18:15.060 --> 18:16.550
Why don't I get him some aspirin.

18:16.628 --> 18:18.493
- Aisle three.
- Okay.

18:18.564 --> 18:20.088
Thanks.

18:20.165 --> 18:21.655
How's Dan?

18:21.733 --> 18:23.564
His nose stopped bleedin'.

18:23.635 --> 18:25.967
He's calmer now.
Somebody gave him a Valium.

18:27.639 --> 18:29.129
Can't believe the way he ran in here.

18:30.142 --> 18:31.302
Never seen him like that.

18:31.376 --> 18:34.675
I need something to cover my boy up.
Got any blankets?

18:35.481 --> 18:37.608
Furniture pads. Loadin' dock.

18:37.683 --> 18:40.743
Gonna keep checkin' on people.
If you need anything, just holler.

18:40.819 --> 18:42.912
You bet. Sally, you mind?

18:42.988 --> 18:45.320
Oh, I'd love to. I really should
help him clean up.

18:45.390 --> 18:47.790
- I'll take him.
- Okay.

18:47.860 --> 18:48.849
Daddy, don't go.

18:48.927 --> 18:52.090
No, I'll be gone two seconds, Big Bill.
Come on, I'm gonna get your blanket.

18:52.164 --> 18:54.064
Mrs. Reppler's here,

18:54.133 --> 18:56.124
and so is Mrs. Turman.

18:57.169 --> 18:58.659
I'll be close by, okay?

18:58.737 --> 19:01.331
- Okay.
- Don't worry, I'm not far. Okay?

19:02.407 --> 19:03.396
Let me look at you.

19:06.278 --> 19:07.267
Hmm?

19:09.081 --> 19:10.139
Wanna lie down?

19:10.215 --> 19:11.204
Yeah.

19:12.284 --> 19:13.546
There you go.

19:13.619 --> 19:17.282
Soon as it blows away,
we can walk out of here safe and free,

19:17.356 --> 19:18.789
but we have to be smart about it.

19:18.857 --> 19:21.519
First thing we need to do
is keep our wits about us

19:21.593 --> 19:23.151
and find out what's happened.

19:23.228 --> 19:24.718
Well, Howe gonna
do that, my man?

19:24.796 --> 19:27.390
We've got no phone signal,
got no radio.

19:27.466 --> 19:30.026
I'm sure they're working
on those problems as we speak.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.332
It stands to reason
that restoring communications

19:32.404 --> 19:33.393
would be their top priority.

19:46.285 --> 19:48.344
Jeez!

20:07.839 --> 20:10.034
Oh, shit.

20:11.542 --> 20:13.032
Ow!

20:15.013 --> 20:16.002
Shit!

20:20.352 --> 20:21.512
God damn it!

20:21.587 --> 20:23.578
Ow! Ow!

20:25.190 --> 20:26.782
Bitch!

20:26.858 --> 20:28.018
It's obvious that we're--

20:28.093 --> 20:30.084
we're in some kind
of natural disaster here.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.790
Ain't nothin' obvious
about this sombitch from where I sit.

20:32.864 --> 20:35.196
There ain't nothin'
natural about it either.

20:35.267 --> 20:36.256
That's right.

20:36.335 --> 20:38.997
It's Judgment Day,
and it's come round at last.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.562
There is nothing more obvious
or natural than that.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.130
Ohh, fuck, now.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.869
You've done that to yourself,

20:44.943 --> 20:46.843
by a life of sin and dissolution.

21:33.191 --> 21:34.852
Hey, whoa! David!

21:34.926 --> 21:37.292
Hey, you guys hear that?

21:37.362 --> 21:39.262
The generator?
We're just gonna check it out.

21:39.331 --> 21:41.196
No, no, I turned the generator off.

21:41.266 --> 21:43.257
It-- it was backing up.

21:44.870 --> 21:47.270
- N-nobody else heard that sound?
- What sound?

21:48.273 --> 21:51.970
I don't know, like a... weird noise,

21:52.044 --> 21:53.807
back there in the dark.

21:53.879 --> 21:56.370
Like something was, like,
pressing against the door.

21:56.448 --> 21:59.975
Did you hear it
before the lights went out, or after?

22:00.052 --> 22:01.917
No, only after.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.251
After, but, look, I heard it, okay?

22:04.323 --> 22:06.382
- Nobody's calling you a liar.
- That's what it sounds like.

22:06.458 --> 22:09.120
No, no, no, no.
Now, don't be thattaway, Mr. Drayton.

22:09.194 --> 22:11.253
You had a scare, no doubt.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.991
What say we all go check it out?

22:13.065 --> 22:14.498
Here.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.436
Oooopf!

22:22.507 --> 22:23.496
Man.

22:23.575 --> 22:25.668
It's pretty rank in here.

22:25.744 --> 22:27.871
- Myron, go check it out.
- All right.

22:30.816 --> 22:32.113
Go on, fire it up.

22:40.792 --> 22:43.124
All right!

22:43.195 --> 22:44.287
Shut it off!

22:45.364 --> 22:47.093
Holy crow, don't that stink!

22:47.999 --> 22:49.432
Something's
got the exhaust vent

22:49.501 --> 22:51.128
plugged up from the outside.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.637
You get it running long enough
to raise that door a little,

22:53.705 --> 22:55.195
I'll go out and clear
whatever's blockin' it.

22:55.273 --> 22:56.433
No, no, you can't do that.

22:56.508 --> 22:58.499
Why not?
It's an electric door, right?

22:58.577 --> 23:01.569
Well, yeah, but it may not be wise
to send him out there.

23:01.646 --> 23:02.977
Okay, I'll do it.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.948
No, look, it's not about
who goes out there.

23:05.016 --> 23:07.007
What, don't you think I can do it?

23:07.085 --> 23:09.713
Hey! I want to go!
It was my idea.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.278
Well, wait, just stop, okay?

23:11.356 --> 23:12.948
- J-Jim, right?
Mm-hmm.

23:13.024 --> 23:15.515
Myron? You guys are--

23:15.595 --> 23:17.688
you, well, you don't seem
to understand,

23:17.763 --> 23:19.321
or you're tryin' real hard not to.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.059
This is no ordinary mist, okay?

23:21.133 --> 23:24.296
You open that door,
and something gets in here.

23:24.369 --> 23:25.529
Like what?

23:26.838 --> 23:28.738
Well, like whatever
made that noise I heard.

23:28.807 --> 23:30.297
Are you guys being willfully dense?

23:30.375 --> 23:32.707
Mr. Drayton, you'll pardon me,

23:32.778 --> 23:36.441
but I'm not convinced
that you heard anything.

23:36.515 --> 23:38.346
I mean, we're not
hearing anything now, right?

23:38.417 --> 23:39.406
Anybody?

23:40.752 --> 23:41.741
See?

23:43.088 --> 23:46.114
Now, I know, I know--
you're a big shot artist

23:46.191 --> 23:48.682
with connections in New York
and Hollywood and all like that,

23:48.760 --> 23:51.058
but that don't make you better
than anybody else, not in my book.

23:51.129 --> 23:52.494
Hey, I didn't say that.

23:52.564 --> 23:54.896
Nor do I like being talked down to
or called stupid

23:54.966 --> 23:57.935
by a guy who went to college,
just 'cause he's got the jitters.

23:58.003 --> 24:00.164
Fellas, it doesn't even matter
about the generator.

24:00.238 --> 24:01.603
The food'll keep without it.

24:01.673 --> 24:04.403
Kid, I'm gonna start the motor,
you raise the door,

24:04.476 --> 24:06.103
and you yell out
when you got enough room.

24:06.178 --> 24:07.702
Yeah. Okay, good.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.542
Wait.

24:09.614 --> 24:10.603
This is--

24:10.682 --> 24:12.582
You guys gonna let
this kid risk his life

24:12.651 --> 24:14.380
over a generator
that doesn't even matter?

24:14.453 --> 24:15.886
Would you just
shut the fuck up already?

24:15.954 --> 24:16.943
Norm!

24:17.022 --> 24:19.013
Listen, Mr. Drayton,
I tell you what.

24:19.090 --> 24:21.081
The next time
you got somethin' to say,

24:21.159 --> 24:22.524
you count your teeth,

24:22.594 --> 24:25.927
because I'm sick to death
of your bullshit.

24:25.997 --> 24:27.487
All right?

24:27.566 --> 24:28.555
Come on, Myron.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.294
This is crazy!
Leave 'em be.

24:30.368 --> 24:32.336
What am I, impugning
their manhood or something?

24:32.904 --> 24:34.895
Listen, they've lost
their sense of proportion.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.304
What's going on here?

24:36.374 --> 24:38.137
Out there in the market,
they were scared and confused.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.201
In here, there's a problem
they can solve,

24:40.278 --> 24:42.303
so they're goddamn gonna solve it.

24:42.380 --> 24:43.870
Ready, kid?
- Let's rock.

24:43.949 --> 24:45.314
Norm, come on.

24:45.383 --> 24:46.372
Don't, man.

24:50.755 --> 24:51.915
It's a mistake.

24:56.529 --> 24:57.689
Pussy.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.293
Go up!

25:25.490 --> 25:26.616
So...

25:26.691 --> 25:28.181
any boogeymen?

25:31.096 --> 25:32.586
Pretty scary, ain't it, Norm?

25:32.664 --> 25:34.723
Yeah, right.

25:37.969 --> 25:38.958
Norm.

25:40.138 --> 25:41.730
Norm!

25:41.806 --> 25:43.103
What the fuck!

25:43.174 --> 25:44.732
Ahh! Get it off! Get it off!

25:44.809 --> 25:46.709
Get this friggin' thing off me!

25:46.778 --> 25:48.507
Get it off! Help me!

25:48.680 --> 25:50.375
Help me! Help me!

25:50.448 --> 25:51.915
Aah! Aaahhh!

25:51.983 --> 25:53.382
Jesus!

26:03.627 --> 26:06.619
There's more! There's more!

26:07.198 --> 26:08.631
Somebody help me.

26:10.669 --> 26:12.159
Somebody help me.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.898
What the fuck are you waitin' for?

26:19.244 --> 26:21.678
Aaahhhh!

26:26.318 --> 26:27.683
Hang on!

26:29.187 --> 26:31.417
Aaahhhh!

26:37.395 --> 26:40.592
Hold him still!
Hold him still!

26:44.436 --> 26:45.425
Aaahhhh!

26:48.574 --> 26:50.565
Oh, Jesus!

27:15.266 --> 27:16.255
Aah!

27:17.769 --> 27:18.758
Aah!

27:23.975 --> 27:25.636
Shit! Oh, shit!

27:25.710 --> 27:27.803
Oh, shit!

27:29.581 --> 27:31.742
David, it's no good!

27:31.816 --> 27:32.805
Aah!

27:32.884 --> 27:34.374
Start the generator.

27:34.452 --> 27:37.012
Aah! Aaaggghhh!

27:48.733 --> 27:49.722
Gaaahhhh!

28:43.587 --> 28:44.918
Hey, I'm sorry.

28:47.926 --> 28:49.086
I mean, how the--

28:49.160 --> 28:51.185
how the hell was I supposed
to know what you meant?

28:52.597 --> 28:54.224
You said you heard something.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.057
How was I supposed to know
what you meant?

28:57.135 --> 28:58.329
You should've said
what you meant better.

28:58.403 --> 29:01.895
I don't know, I thought maybe
it was a big bird or something.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.339
You got that kid killed!

29:04.409 --> 29:06.377
Did you get a good look at it? Huh?

29:06.444 --> 29:09.607
Did you get a good look
at what you did?

29:09.681 --> 29:10.875
- Huh?
- David!

29:10.949 --> 29:12.280
Don't hit him anymore!
Doesn't solve anything!

29:12.350 --> 29:15.183
You two assholes,
you got that kid killed!

29:15.253 --> 29:17.244
And I got his fuckin' blood on me!

29:36.975 --> 29:39.136
Okay, I'm done.

29:41.246 --> 29:42.235
Okay.

29:45.316 --> 29:46.806
What's next?

29:47.819 --> 29:49.343
Kill the generator.

29:49.854 --> 29:51.014
That's the first thing.

29:54.926 --> 29:56.291
I'm sorry.

30:00.965 --> 30:03.092
Jesus Christ! Oh, God!

30:03.168 --> 30:05.728
I'm-- I'm sorry about the kid.

30:07.772 --> 30:09.967
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

30:11.409 --> 30:12.740
We oughta get out of here.

30:17.115 --> 30:18.412
Hey, we didn't twist his arm.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.782
Yeah, he's a fuckin' kid.
He's supposed to be stupid.

30:22.787 --> 30:24.687
What's your excuse, huh?

30:27.892 --> 30:29.223
Get outta here.

30:30.295 --> 30:32.126
Go back in the market.
Stay by the door.

30:34.465 --> 30:36.433
Don't say anything, to anybody.

30:37.969 --> 30:39.027
Not yet.

30:40.606 --> 30:41.595
Not yet.

30:56.654 --> 30:57.643
Shit.

30:57.722 --> 31:00.953
David? Need a little light here.

31:11.769 --> 31:13.566
We have to tell 'em.

31:13.637 --> 31:16.470
The people in the market,
we have to stop 'em going outside.

31:17.775 --> 31:19.106
They won't believe us.

31:20.411 --> 31:21.400
They have to.

31:21.479 --> 31:23.743
I'm not sure I believe it.
I was here.

31:24.782 --> 31:26.875
W-what we saw was impossible.

31:26.951 --> 31:28.885
You know that, don't you?

31:28.953 --> 31:29.942
I mean, what--

31:31.622 --> 31:32.953
what do we say?

31:33.958 --> 31:36.620
How do we convince them?

31:39.630 --> 31:43.623
Ollie, what the hell were
those tentacles even attached to?

31:49.474 --> 31:51.806
Oh, my God!
Are-- are you all right?

31:51.876 --> 31:54.367
Shh! Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's not my blood. I'm fine.

31:54.445 --> 31:55.776
W-what the hell happened?

31:55.847 --> 31:57.644
I'll explain. Give me a minute, okay?

31:57.715 --> 31:59.706
I need to deal with something first.

32:01.619 --> 32:03.211
Please, I've got to--

32:03.288 --> 32:06.018
I can't let Billy see me like this.
He's scared enough.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.957
Just give me a minute.
Keep him distracted. Okay?

32:09.027 --> 32:10.016
Okay.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.702
Hey, look,
I'm sorry about Norm.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.135
Me too.

32:20.204 --> 32:22.604
I mean, I ain't makin' excuses,
I'm just sayin'.

32:22.674 --> 32:23.971
Look, we need to tell people.

32:24.042 --> 32:26.533
No need to say how it went down
or anything like that,

32:26.612 --> 32:29.376
but, uh, we're in the deep shit here.

32:29.447 --> 32:30.914
People need to know.

32:30.982 --> 32:32.540
What about the out-of-towners?

32:32.617 --> 32:35.381
We got plenty of them in the store.
Where do we even start?

32:35.453 --> 32:37.683
Brent Norton?
That windbag?

32:37.755 --> 32:40.485
He's an important attorney
in New York.

32:40.558 --> 32:42.719
That fellow could be
on the bench one day.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.285
Counts a lot with people of this town,
or-- or anywhere.

32:45.363 --> 32:46.887
Yeah, that's right.
- Do it quick, David.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.900
We've got to discuss how we're gonna
stop that thing getting in here.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.731
W-wait. What do you mean
getting in?

32:52.303 --> 32:53.827
You shut the loading door.

32:53.905 --> 32:57.466
Yeah, but the entire front of the store
is plate glass.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.303
Jesus Christ.

33:13.858 --> 33:15.689
I was wondering
where you'd gotten to.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.250
Um, listen...

33:17.328 --> 33:20.092
that guy that came in here,
the one with the bloody nose...

33:25.604 --> 33:29.096
...they're-- they're--
We saw tentacles.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.606
Ain't goin' very well, is it?

33:31.608 --> 33:33.166
Unh-unh.

33:34.245 --> 33:35.735
- You... what?
- Come here, you've got--

33:36.948 --> 33:38.142
Come here.

33:40.218 --> 33:41.207
Tell him.

33:43.287 --> 33:44.276
It's true.

33:51.129 --> 33:53.529
Tentacles. Yeah.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.197
Um, gentlemen, um...

34:05.410 --> 34:08.004
I'm sorry, I--
I'm just not that stupid.

34:08.079 --> 34:09.478
I mean, what do you take me for?

34:09.547 --> 34:11.242
I'm shocked.

34:12.315 --> 34:13.304
I'm shocked.

34:13.384 --> 34:15.511
I'm shocked. It's pretty tasteless

34:15.585 --> 34:17.577
using what's happening here
to try to make me look like an idiot.

34:17.655 --> 34:19.315
No, no, that's not
what's going on here.

34:19.389 --> 34:21.358
Look, come back
to the loading dock, okay?

34:21.426 --> 34:22.415
I'll show you.

34:22.493 --> 34:26.088
Blood. A chunk of tentacle
on-- on the floor.

34:26.164 --> 34:27.152
No.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.926
No? What do you mean no?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.161
No. We've got real problems
to deal with here,

34:31.235 --> 34:34.398
and this pathetic attempt at a joke

34:34.472 --> 34:36.406
has gone far enough.

34:36.474 --> 34:39.466
Mr. Norton, what reason
could we possibly have--?

34:39.543 --> 34:41.170
Oh, please! Please!

34:41.245 --> 34:43.735
This is payback for the lawsuit
that I filed against him last year,

34:43.815 --> 34:45.646
and you guys are backing him up.

34:45.716 --> 34:47.377
So winning wasn't enough, huh?

34:47.452 --> 34:49.647
You wanted to humiliate me
some more,

34:49.719 --> 34:52.052
show me a rubber snake
while these-- these hicks

34:52.123 --> 34:53.454
stand around laughing their asses off.

34:53.524 --> 34:54.786
- Watch who you callin' a hick!
- Myron! Myron!

34:54.859 --> 34:56.724
- Hey, hey, fuck--!
Mr. Norton...

34:56.793 --> 34:59.388
... I swear, you have
got us all wrong.

34:59.464 --> 35:03.958
You're not too crazy about,
um, out-of-towners, are you?

35:05.036 --> 35:07.061
I only spend my money,
and I pay my taxes here,

35:07.138 --> 35:11.006
and I have seen you
talking behind my back.

35:12.410 --> 35:13.843
Y'all stick together.

35:17.181 --> 35:18.842
Well, don't I feel foolish?

35:18.916 --> 35:21.407
I actually thought you were
being kind to me today,

35:21.486 --> 35:22.976
and, well, thanks
for setting me straight.

35:23.054 --> 35:25.215
And I'm glad that tree fell
on your boathouse, you know that?

35:25.289 --> 35:27.689
Glad. Smashed it in
pretty good, didn't it? Fantastic.

35:27.758 --> 35:29.350
Now, all of y'all,
just stay out of my way.

35:29.427 --> 35:31.987
I know you're scared, man.
I'm scared too.

35:32.063 --> 35:34.122
- Lives are at stake around here.
- David--

35:34.198 --> 35:36.530
Okay, my son's life.
Now, I need you.

35:36.601 --> 35:40.162
Brent, please,
get your head out of your ass.

35:40.238 --> 35:42.297
All right, I'll drag you
back there if I have to.

35:42.373 --> 35:43.362
Come here.

35:43.441 --> 35:46.433
David, get your goddamn hands
off of me!

35:46.511 --> 35:48.445
I'll sue your ass again!

35:48.513 --> 35:50.777
Sue your ass, and this time
you'll go to jail!

35:50.848 --> 35:52.338
This man assaulted me.

35:52.416 --> 35:55.044
He assaulted me.
You were witness to it.

35:55.119 --> 35:56.108
This man's crazy.
He's crazy.

35:56.187 --> 35:57.814
No.

35:57.889 --> 36:00.289
He isn't. I wish he was, but he isn't.

36:02.493 --> 36:06.623
E-everyone in the store,
you want to come back here?

36:07.698 --> 36:10.326
There's something you need to hear.
It concerns you all.

36:10.401 --> 36:11.698
Okay.

36:11.769 --> 36:14.761
W-w-wait. I don't know
what you people think you're doing.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.329
You're drinking?

36:16.407 --> 36:17.897
For Christ's sake, Ollie.

36:18.910 --> 36:22.004
Do you want me to report you?
You want to lose your job?

36:22.079 --> 36:23.979
Look, I'm gonna be taking down
names, starting with you.

36:24.048 --> 36:26.016
And I am prepared to file
a police report.

36:26.083 --> 36:28.074
- Fine, Bud, write down your names.
- I will.

36:28.152 --> 36:30.985
But in the meantime,
shut the fuck up and listen.

36:32.790 --> 36:34.018
This is Mr. David Drayton.

36:34.091 --> 36:37.424
You need to hear what he's got to say
if you're thinking about leaving.

36:37.495 --> 36:39.156
...go hang out
with the ladies, all right?

36:39.230 --> 36:40.561
Listen, don't be scared.

36:42.733 --> 36:43.722
It's okay.

36:45.937 --> 36:46.926
Okay.

36:48.105 --> 36:49.436
This is how it is.

36:49.506 --> 36:51.940
Now, I don't know
what this mist is...

36:52.944 --> 36:55.174
but there are things in it, and they're
dangerous, like Dan said.

36:55.246 --> 36:56.235
That's right.

36:56.814 --> 36:58.645
That's exactly right.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.581
What kind of things?

37:00.650 --> 37:02.641
I never saw it.
It happened too fast.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.517
I got knocked down.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.751
Five of us went back
in the loading dock.

37:06.824 --> 37:10.419
It was Jim, Myron, Ollie...

37:10.494 --> 37:12.155
me...

37:12.230 --> 37:13.720
Norm, the bag boy.

37:13.798 --> 37:15.288
- We opened the door...
- Where's Norm?

37:15.366 --> 37:19.097
...so Norm could go out
and clear the vent for the generator.

37:20.404 --> 37:22.031
Something come out of the mist
and took him.

37:22.106 --> 37:23.095
Took him?

37:23.174 --> 37:24.766
What do you mean?

37:26.344 --> 37:27.504
Just... killed him.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.443
I mean dragged him off.

37:29.513 --> 37:34.075
Now, guys, I don't know
what these things are.

37:35.152 --> 37:36.642
All we saw were tentacles.

37:40.591 --> 37:41.580
Tentacles?

37:44.762 --> 37:46.354
Tentacles, he says.

37:46.931 --> 37:49.024
Tentacles from Planet X.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.431
It's a lie, you know.

37:50.501 --> 37:53.629
I mean, all these people do
is just lie each other up.

37:53.704 --> 37:54.932
It's a pile of shit.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.496
Of course it's a lie.
Of course it's a lie.

37:56.573 --> 37:57.562
It's lunacy.

37:58.576 --> 38:01.136
From the look of it, the tentacles
are coming out of the beer cans.

38:01.212 --> 38:02.907
All right, uh, Bud,
don't take our word for it.

38:02.980 --> 38:03.969
Go look.

38:10.721 --> 38:11.710
Over there.

38:17.395 --> 38:18.885
What the hell is that?

38:51.362 --> 38:54.695
It appears we may have a problem
of some magnitude here.

39:10.881 --> 39:12.371
Yeah, just keep 'em in line.
Thanks.

39:23.394 --> 39:25.055
Let me...

39:27.231 --> 39:30.598
help these people.

39:30.668 --> 39:32.499
Let me--

39:32.570 --> 39:34.561
let me preach your word.

39:36.574 --> 39:39.008
Let me shine your light,

39:39.076 --> 39:41.567
'cause they're not all bad.

39:42.579 --> 39:44.911
They can't all be bad.

39:47.918 --> 39:51.854
Some can be saved, can't they?

39:51.922 --> 39:53.685
Yes.

39:53.758 --> 39:55.248
Some can be brought...

39:56.260 --> 39:59.525
to heaven's holy gates
through your grace.

39:59.597 --> 40:00.825
I have to believe that,

40:00.898 --> 40:05.301
though I know most will swim
in the lake of fire forever.

40:08.939 --> 40:10.600
If I can save a few...

40:11.942 --> 40:13.933
even one...

40:14.945 --> 40:17.436
then my life will have counted
for something.

40:18.449 --> 40:21.282
I will have pulled my weight.

40:21.352 --> 40:24.719
I will have earned my place
at your side.

40:24.789 --> 40:29.123
I will have served a purpose
here on this earth.

40:29.193 --> 40:30.683
Hello?

40:46.811 --> 40:48.073
What?

40:48.145 --> 40:50.375
I just need to use the bathroom.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.437
Oh.

40:52.650 --> 40:55.050
Okay. Well, then, have at it.

40:59.356 --> 41:00.584
Ma'am...

41:01.660 --> 41:05.528
I-- I just want you to know
that it's okay--

41:05.597 --> 41:07.258
being scared, I mean--

41:07.331 --> 41:09.891
and, well, if you need a friend--

41:09.967 --> 41:12.401
you know, someone to talk to.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.461
I have a friend--

41:14.537 --> 41:18.439
God up above.
I talk to him every day.

41:18.509 --> 41:20.500
Don't you condescend to me.

41:20.577 --> 41:21.703
I'm sorry?

41:21.779 --> 41:25.306
Not ever.
You don't mock me.

41:25.382 --> 41:27.009
That's not what I was doing.

41:28.018 --> 41:30.009
Well, I'll tell you what--

41:30.087 --> 41:31.918
the day I need a friend like you,

41:31.989 --> 41:35.049
I'll just have myself a little squat
and shit one out.

41:40.898 --> 41:42.559
Maybe you do believe this.

41:42.632 --> 41:45.726
Maybe they're not lies,
they're delusions. Whatever.

41:45.803 --> 41:49.034
Uh, the fact remains,
the evidence here is flimsy.

41:49.106 --> 41:51.131
- It's bordering on ludicrous.
- Hey, this isn't a courtroom.

41:52.142 --> 41:53.131
You're not arguing a case,

41:53.210 --> 41:54.768
and you're doing nothing but damage,
talking the way you are.

41:54.845 --> 41:57.837
And you can throw as much cow's blood
around the loading dock as you want to.

41:57.915 --> 41:59.348
You still haven't fooled anyone.

41:59.416 --> 42:00.474
Leave it alone, David.

42:00.550 --> 42:02.245
You can't convince
some people there's a fire

42:02.319 --> 42:04.310
even when their hair is burning.

42:04.388 --> 42:05.878
Denial is a powerful thing.

42:05.956 --> 42:06.945
Well, keep talking.

42:07.024 --> 42:10.357
I'll have no part of it,
nor would any thinking person.

42:10.427 --> 42:13.123
Keep thinking, Mr. Lawyer.

42:13.197 --> 42:16.132
There's no defense
against the will of God.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.395
There's no court of appeals in hell.

42:18.469 --> 42:20.869
There's no defense here, either.

42:20.938 --> 42:23.168
Not even with all the fertilizer
in the world,

42:23.240 --> 42:25.731
not even if you stack it
as high as you can.

42:25.809 --> 42:28.334
It's still just bags of shit, isn't it?

42:28.412 --> 42:30.403
Those of you who want to discuss
this thing rationally

42:30.481 --> 42:34.508
to find a means of rescue
are welcome to join me.

42:34.585 --> 42:37.247
Those who want to stack dog food,

42:37.321 --> 42:38.879
knock yourselves out.

42:42.625 --> 42:44.957
We got those windows taped up
as best we could.

42:45.029 --> 42:46.189
It should help.

42:46.263 --> 42:47.594
Yeah, think so?

42:49.632 --> 42:51.463
Duct tape and dog food bags.

42:53.671 --> 42:55.002
That bad?

42:55.072 --> 42:56.061
It's not good.

42:56.140 --> 42:59.303
There's none so blind
as those who will not see.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.170
Open your eyes.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.510
Let the scales fall away.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.573
This has all been written.

43:08.085 --> 43:11.418
Revelations, chapter 15:

43:11.488 --> 43:13.820
"And the temple was filled with smoke

43:13.891 --> 43:16.052
"from the glory of God

43:16.126 --> 43:17.525
"and from his power,

43:17.596 --> 43:19.086
"and no one could enter the temple

43:19.163 --> 43:23.156
until the seven plagues
of the seven angels were completed."

43:23.233 --> 43:25.531
Well, what are you saying?

43:25.604 --> 43:26.935
What are you proposing?

43:27.004 --> 43:28.596
That we all prepare...

43:30.107 --> 43:31.506
to meet our Maker.

43:31.574 --> 43:33.735
Oh, prepare to meet shit!

43:34.778 --> 43:37.303
Lady, your tongue
must be hung in the middle

43:37.381 --> 43:39.281
so that it can waggle at both ends.

43:39.350 --> 43:41.113
The end time has come,

43:41.185 --> 43:42.948
not in flames, but in mist.

43:43.020 --> 43:44.009
Come here!

43:44.088 --> 43:45.214
Easy! Back off!

43:45.289 --> 43:48.315
How about if your ass prepares
to meet my size-10 work boot.

43:48.392 --> 43:49.381
How about that?

43:49.460 --> 43:50.950
Hey, there's no call for that.

43:51.028 --> 43:53.588
Myron, please,
calm your friend down.

43:53.664 --> 43:56.428
I'm trying
to save your soul, you stupid man.

43:56.500 --> 43:58.695
- Doubters will doubt till the end.
- It's okay.

43:58.769 --> 43:59.827
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43:59.903 --> 44:02.497
A monstrosity did pull
that poor boy away.

44:03.073 --> 44:06.440
Things in the mist--
do you doubt?

44:06.510 --> 44:07.499
Do you?

44:09.079 --> 44:11.013
Then go out.

44:11.081 --> 44:13.447
Go out and say,
"How do you do."

44:13.517 --> 44:14.506
Shut up, lady.

44:16.253 --> 44:17.447
For God's sakes.

44:17.521 --> 44:19.682
Look, you'll have to stop now.
You're scaring the children.

44:19.757 --> 44:21.156
They should be scared.

44:21.225 --> 44:23.921
Oh, yes, they should.

44:24.928 --> 44:27.453
Their beautiful, pure little minds

44:27.531 --> 44:30.022
have been corrupted with lies.

44:30.100 --> 44:31.089
Lies.

44:31.168 --> 44:33.261
All this talk of a modern God,

44:33.337 --> 44:36.033
or no God.

44:36.106 --> 44:37.767
There is one God.

44:37.841 --> 44:39.502
The God of the Israelites.

44:39.575 --> 44:42.408
And he is a stern and vengeful God,

44:42.479 --> 44:45.039
and we have been mocking him
far too long,

44:45.115 --> 44:48.778
and now he demands
retribution in blood.

44:48.852 --> 44:51.514
It is time to declare yourselves.

44:51.587 --> 44:53.248
Take sides--

44:53.323 --> 44:55.154
the saved and the damned.

44:55.225 --> 44:58.717
Read the Good Book.
It calls for expiation.

44:58.796 --> 45:00.627
- Blood!
- What?

45:00.698 --> 45:01.687
Blood.

45:02.900 --> 45:04.561
Little Normie was first,

45:04.636 --> 45:07.696
and now God calls the rest of us.

45:07.771 --> 45:09.261
The bill is due.

45:09.339 --> 45:10.829
It must be paid.

45:10.908 --> 45:13.900
As Abraham prepared
to sacrifice his only son

45:13.977 --> 45:15.467
to prove his love for God, so--

45:15.547 --> 45:16.741
Enough.

45:22.920 --> 45:25.354
- Ohh.
- Another down payment.

45:25.422 --> 45:26.889
A few more pennies in the jar.

45:26.957 --> 45:29.983
Now, that's nice, see.
I can't smack her, but it's okay for you.

45:30.060 --> 45:31.391
I-I'm sorry everybody,

45:31.462 --> 45:34.454
but this lady's perspective is
a little too Old Testament for my taste.

45:34.531 --> 45:36.021
They'll come for you.

45:37.067 --> 45:39.558
Maybe tonight,
when darkness comes.

45:41.105 --> 45:44.006
They'll come tonight,
and they'll take someone else.

45:44.074 --> 45:46.065
See if they don't.

45:46.143 --> 45:47.872
And when they do,

45:47.945 --> 45:50.573
you will cry to God,

45:50.648 --> 45:54.311
and you will beg Mother Carmody
to show you the way.

45:54.384 --> 45:55.715
That's fine.

45:56.787 --> 45:59.051
But until then,
if you don't shut up,

45:59.123 --> 46:01.114
I'll wrap this tape around your mouth.

46:01.191 --> 46:03.523
You just try it, Ollie Weeks.

46:03.595 --> 46:05.085
And you, bitch...

46:06.563 --> 46:08.053
you hit me again...

46:09.066 --> 46:10.226
if you dare.

46:11.235 --> 46:13.897
You'll be on your knees to me
before this is through.

46:20.645 --> 46:22.442
Those of you who aren't local
should know

46:22.513 --> 46:25.346
that Mrs. Carmody
is known in town for being...

46:26.416 --> 46:27.405
unstable.

46:27.484 --> 46:30.885
No shit.
What was your first clue?

46:33.957 --> 46:35.447
Shh.

46:36.493 --> 46:38.324
Hi.

46:38.395 --> 46:39.555
What's up, little dude?

46:39.631 --> 46:41.428
How come your friends
don't come get us?

46:41.498 --> 46:42.988
They got tanks and stuff, right?

46:44.434 --> 46:45.833
Why can't you just call 'em?

46:45.903 --> 46:47.063
Phones don't work.

46:47.137 --> 46:48.900
But don't you got, like, a radio?

46:48.972 --> 46:50.462
Hey, champ, what's going on?

46:50.541 --> 46:52.668
I want their friends
to come rescue us.

46:52.743 --> 46:54.734
They would if they could, pal.
They're stuck here just like us.

46:54.812 --> 46:55.801
But--

46:55.879 --> 46:57.744
Shh. Now, guys, we could use
a hand over there.

46:57.815 --> 46:58.804
Yeah, sure thing.

46:58.882 --> 47:00.315
Troop, off your asses.

47:00.384 --> 47:03.444
You all right?
- I don't like that scary lady.

47:03.520 --> 47:05.852
Oh, man, I don't either.

47:05.923 --> 47:07.390
But you know what?

47:08.392 --> 47:10.189
Maybe she's scared too.

47:11.195 --> 47:12.184
You think?

47:13.230 --> 47:14.720
You think Mommy's okay?

47:15.732 --> 47:18.064
Billy...

47:20.938 --> 47:23.099
I'm sorry about the times
I was bad to her.

47:23.173 --> 47:24.162
Aw, hey.

47:25.242 --> 47:28.336
Mommy loves you very much.

47:28.412 --> 47:29.902
And I'll bet she's fine.

47:31.748 --> 47:33.739
And I promise you,

47:33.817 --> 47:36.980
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get us back to her.

47:38.588 --> 47:39.953
- Okay?
- 'Kay.

47:41.024 --> 47:42.457
- Yeah?
- 'Kay.

47:43.460 --> 47:46.293
So, we can use the charcoal fluid
and the mops

47:46.363 --> 47:47.694
to make torches.

47:47.764 --> 47:49.629
And we've got knives and stuff,
God knows.

47:49.700 --> 47:52.100
This may be
a silly question, Bud, but...

47:53.103 --> 47:54.934
do you happen to have
a gun in the store?

47:55.939 --> 47:57.770
Here? No. Please.

47:57.841 --> 47:59.570
This-- this isn't Los Angeles.

47:59.642 --> 48:01.303
I've got a shotgun in my truck.

48:02.647 --> 48:04.137
I could try for it if you want.

48:04.214 --> 48:06.478
Oh, God, I don't think that'd be
a good idea, Mr. Cornell.

48:06.550 --> 48:07.539
Hold on.

48:10.053 --> 48:11.520
This gun, um...

48:11.587 --> 48:13.487
my husband's idea.

48:13.557 --> 48:15.548
He's away on business a lot.

48:15.626 --> 48:16.786
It's not even loaded.

48:16.860 --> 48:18.487
Ain't much use unloaded, ma'am.

48:18.561 --> 48:19.550
Um...

48:23.233 --> 48:24.666
You know how to use that?

48:24.735 --> 48:26.327
Well, I shot it once on a pistol range.

48:26.403 --> 48:27.893
Hit the target a few times.

48:28.906 --> 48:31.500
So, we got a gun.

48:31.575 --> 48:33.509
Anybody know how to shoot it?

48:33.576 --> 48:34.941
Well, I mean?

48:35.012 --> 48:36.001
I do.

48:38.782 --> 48:39.771
You?

48:39.850 --> 48:42.683
Ollie. Please.

48:48.025 --> 48:49.925
Some target shooting.

48:49.993 --> 48:52.188
State champion in '94.

48:52.262 --> 48:54.127
You're crazy if you go out there!
Let us pass!

48:54.197 --> 48:56.131
Let us pass, please!

48:56.199 --> 48:57.188
Let's just talk this thing through.

48:57.267 --> 48:59.428
We have, and we've
made our decision. We're leaving.

48:59.503 --> 49:02.529
Hey, Mr. Mackey's gonna barbecue
some chicken on the gas grill.

49:02.606 --> 49:04.938
- Why don't we just sit down and just--
- What, and let you keep on talking?

49:05.008 --> 49:07.101
No, I've been in far too many
courtrooms to fall for that.

49:07.177 --> 49:09.304
You've already psyched out
half a dozen of my people already.

49:09.379 --> 49:10.368
Your people?

49:10.447 --> 49:12.278
What kind of talk is that?
They're people, that's all.

49:12.349 --> 49:13.782
Now-- now listen, everyone.

49:13.850 --> 49:16.842
We are experiencing
some kind of disaster.

49:16.920 --> 49:18.911
I don't know whether
it's man-made or natural,

49:18.989 --> 49:22.891
but I do know that
it's definitely not supernatural

49:22.960 --> 49:25.258
or biblical,
and, no offense, Mrs. Carmody,

49:25.329 --> 49:26.956
but the only way
we're gonna help ourselves

49:27.030 --> 49:28.691
is to seek rescue.

49:30.567 --> 49:31.556
We're going out.

49:34.237 --> 49:36.296
- Brent, look.
- I'm not discussing this any further.

49:36.373 --> 49:38.534
I know. I just want to ask a favor.

49:40.243 --> 49:41.733
Tie this around your waist.

49:41.812 --> 49:42.972
What for?

49:43.046 --> 49:45.139
It'll let us know you got
at least 300 feet.

49:47.384 --> 49:48.373
I'll do it.

49:49.953 --> 49:51.420
Are you throwing in with them?

49:51.488 --> 49:53.581
Me? No thanks.

49:53.657 --> 49:56.148
I think your man there
is a little too tightly wound.

49:56.226 --> 49:58.421
Gonna get somebody killed.

49:58.495 --> 50:01.293
But I'm thinkin' we could use
that shotgun of yours.

50:01.865 --> 50:04.026
I saw where you parked
when I pulled in.

50:04.101 --> 50:06.262
Red pickup, right?
Far entrance?

50:06.336 --> 50:08.327
Son, you got brass balls.

50:09.272 --> 50:11.103
The shells are
in the glove compartment.

50:11.174 --> 50:12.163
Drive it back.

50:14.611 --> 50:15.873
All right.

50:15.946 --> 50:17.607
Just see they're paying out this line.

50:17.681 --> 50:19.876
Line's up, I'll cut her loose,

50:19.950 --> 50:21.440
just so you understand.

50:21.518 --> 50:22.507
Yeah.

50:30.127 --> 50:32.459
You sure there's no way
I can talk you out of this?

50:32.528 --> 50:33.517
David...

50:34.531 --> 50:37.796
there's nothing out there.
Nothing in the mist.

50:37.868 --> 50:39.859
What if you're wrong?

50:40.937 --> 50:42.427
Then, I guess...

50:44.474 --> 50:47.466
the joke would be on me after all.

50:52.783 --> 50:54.011
We're gonna send back help.

50:55.152 --> 50:57.484
You'll die out there.
All of you.

51:10.233 --> 51:13.430
Hey, crazy lady,
I believe in God too.

51:13.503 --> 51:16.097
I just don't think
he's the bloodthirsty asshole

51:16.173 --> 51:17.504
you make him out to be.

51:17.574 --> 51:20.304
Well, you take that up with the devil
when you run into him.

51:20.377 --> 51:21.901
You just chat it over at your leisure.

51:30.620 --> 51:32.554
Well, let's strike out
toward the center of town.

51:51.708 --> 51:52.868
Keep it loose.

52:08.825 --> 52:10.315
Nice and easy.

52:10.393 --> 52:11.655
Keep going.

52:29.312 --> 52:30.301
Look.

52:33.483 --> 52:34.745
It's going.

52:36.820 --> 52:37.980
They're doing good.

52:39.990 --> 52:41.582
Aah! Aaahhhh!

52:56.039 --> 52:57.267
Put it down!

52:58.341 --> 53:00.605
Ohh! Pull!

53:02.480 --> 53:04.914
Oh, my God!
I'm slippin'!

53:06.416 --> 53:08.748
Pull! Back up! Back up!
Back up!

53:22.165 --> 53:23.154
Get it off!

53:32.576 --> 53:33.565
Oh, my God.

53:40.283 --> 53:41.750
Aw, sh--
Blood!

53:41.818 --> 53:43.547
Awww, sh--!

53:43.620 --> 53:45.281
Oh, my God!

53:46.456 --> 53:48.754
Oh, my God!

54:03.273 --> 54:04.570
Cut the rope!

54:07.344 --> 54:08.276
Shut the door!

54:14.084 --> 54:16.075
Now do you see?

54:18.088 --> 54:19.578
Now do you believe?

54:29.099 --> 54:30.930
About a half-hour of daylight left.

54:32.269 --> 54:34.032
Guys, how's it going
with these work lights?

54:34.104 --> 54:35.435
We're gettin' 'em rigged up all right.

54:36.439 --> 54:37.770
Yeah, check it out.

54:37.841 --> 54:40.366
All right, all right.
Save it, save it.

54:40.443 --> 54:42.240
These batteries ain't topped up.

54:42.312 --> 54:44.439
You turn the lights on,
it's gonna drain 'em quick.

54:44.514 --> 54:45.606
How quick?

54:45.682 --> 54:47.707
- Five minutes, maybe ten.
- Yeah, if that.

54:47.784 --> 54:49.775
Okay, emergencies only.

54:50.787 --> 54:52.277
If something gets in the store.

54:59.996 --> 55:02.590
Holy Jesus,
you scared the shit outta me.

55:02.665 --> 55:04.155
Oh, Sally, I'm sorry, really.

55:05.735 --> 55:08.568
I thought I'd come in and say hi
and see how you were holding up.

55:08.639 --> 55:10.129
- Hi.
- Hi.

55:11.241 --> 55:12.572
Barely. How about you?

55:12.642 --> 55:14.234
I'm worried about my folks, I guess.

55:14.311 --> 55:16.973
You know, they live
up on Shorm Road.

55:17.047 --> 55:19.072
That's less than
five miles from here.

55:19.149 --> 55:20.810
How 'bout yours?

55:20.884 --> 55:22.374
Well, they're out of town right now.

55:23.420 --> 55:26.014
They're at my aunt's in Boston, so...

55:26.089 --> 55:28.853
That's lucky.
That means they're okay.

55:28.925 --> 55:29.914
I hope so.

55:32.429 --> 55:33.418
So...

55:34.431 --> 55:36.023
how soon you shipping out?

55:36.099 --> 55:37.760
Uh, couple weeks.

55:39.436 --> 55:40.926
Scared about going over there?

55:42.339 --> 55:43.328
Yeah.

55:48.611 --> 55:50.169
- Hey, Wayne?
- Hmm?

55:51.281 --> 55:52.771
How come you never asked me out?

55:53.850 --> 55:56.341
We flirted all through high school.
I know you like me.

56:00.557 --> 56:02.115
So how come?

56:04.561 --> 56:06.392
I'm stupid, I guess.

56:22.912 --> 56:24.903
Oh, shit! I'm sorry.

56:24.981 --> 56:26.209
Don't be. I just--

56:27.217 --> 56:29.515
I just didn't really want it
to happen like this, you know?.

56:29.585 --> 56:31.780
Some shitty locker room at work.

56:32.789 --> 56:34.450
Can we just stay in here
a while, then?

56:35.925 --> 56:37.517
I mean, just-- just you and me.

56:49.606 --> 56:52.131
The parking lot lamps
turned on.

56:52.208 --> 56:53.232
They're on a timer.

56:53.309 --> 56:55.300
Must be a different one
that's live.

56:55.378 --> 56:58.074
Maybe we could
tie into them somehow,

56:58.148 --> 57:00.013
get some electricity in here.

57:01.084 --> 57:02.745
That'd mean walking out the door.

57:13.730 --> 57:15.459
Gaaaahhhh! God!

57:16.332 --> 57:17.799
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

57:17.867 --> 57:19.858
David! David!

57:22.238 --> 57:23.227
...you sure?

57:23.306 --> 57:24.295
Look!

57:47.397 --> 57:48.887
My God.

58:04.414 --> 58:05.904
Are those bugs?

58:08.051 --> 58:09.313
Not like any I've ever seen.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.481
"They came out of the smoke,

58:12.555 --> 58:14.489
"locusts upon the earth,

58:14.557 --> 58:17.082
"and unto them was given power

58:17.160 --> 58:21.324
even as the scorpions
of the earth have power."

58:21.397 --> 58:23.888
Wow.

58:23.967 --> 58:26.435
Look at those stingers.

58:29.906 --> 58:31.897
Dear God.

59:11.080 --> 59:12.570
Holy shit!

59:27.964 --> 59:29.955
Myron, get the ones in the back!

59:31.467 --> 59:33.196
God, I think they're attracted to the light.

59:33.269 --> 59:35.601
Look out, look out, look out!

59:35.672 --> 59:36.764
The light! Douse the light!

59:38.441 --> 59:39.772
Look out! Look out!

59:44.581 --> 59:45.843
Move! Move!

59:47.817 --> 59:50.342
Light, light,
light, light, light!

59:51.487 --> 59:53.318
"And there came a voice
from the temple

59:53.389 --> 59:55.220
"saying to the seven angels,

59:55.291 --> 59:57.623
"'Go your ways

59:57.693 --> 01:00:01.857
and pour out the vials
of the wrath of God upon the earth."'

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:13.241
Ollie,
the glass is gonna give!

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:22.006
Shit!

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:23.575
Oh, my God,
they turned on all the lights!

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:25.814
Jim! Myron!
Fire!

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:27.219
Fire! Lighter!
Douse the lights!

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:29.554
Come on, come on!

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:32.727
Aah!

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:33.784
Whoa!

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:36.322
Aah!

01:00:38.569 --> 01:00:39.501
Ugh!

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:42.560
Sally, look out!

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:45.963
No!

01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:48.408
Ohh! Oohhhh!

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:56.341
Let me see, let me see.
Let me see, sweetheart, let me see.

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:58.353
No, you're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

01:00:58.421 --> 01:00:59.410
Let me see. Let me see.

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.184
You're fine. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:02.588
Give me the lighter!
Put it on fire!

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:03.648
Come on!

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.827
Goddamn childproofing sons of bitches!

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:14.825
Aaahhhh!

01:01:14.904 --> 01:01:17.168
Oh, shoot it! Shoot it!

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.470
Shoot it! Shoot it!

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:22.170
I can't! I'll smash the window!

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:24.406
God!

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.107
Oh, God! Ohh!

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:29.346
- Aaahhh!
- Go! Go!

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:33.552
Get down!

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:41.396
Shit!

01:01:51.107 --> 01:01:52.972
- Ollie, you want these lights on or off?
- Leave 'em on.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.310
Aah! Aaahhhh!

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:00.474
Oh, God!

01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:02.813
Ohh! Ohhh! Kill it!

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:05.217
Aaaaahhhhhh!

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:13.929
Bring torches!
Bring something to keep 'em out!

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:14.985
Come on.

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:18.093
Sally!

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:32.209
Where are the goddamn extinguishers?

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:44.290
Get it! Get it! Get it!

01:02:49.666 --> 01:02:52.635
Bring torches.
We need torches at the window!

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.260
Plug that hole!

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:02.466
Dad!

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:10.079
Down! Down! Lay down!

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.289
Ohh.

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:27.658
My life...

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:32.196
my life for you,
your will be done.

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:47.682
Daddy!

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:50.021
Bugs! Daddy!

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:07.765
- Nooooo! Billy!
- Daddy!

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:09.778
- Billy!
- Daddy!

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:24.282
Billy!

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.520
Dad!

01:04:25.594 --> 01:04:27.084
Billy, come back here.

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:30.789
- Dad!
- Billy, please!

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:38.038
Billy!

01:05:06.936 --> 01:05:08.267
Come on, let's move it!

01:05:08.337 --> 01:05:10.328
Somebody please
come over here and help.

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:12.067
Here's some tape!

01:05:14.343 --> 01:05:16.504
I'm right here.
I'm right here. Don't worry.

01:05:17.579 --> 01:05:19.513
Hurry up with the blankets!

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:22.574
It hurts so bad! Please!

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.087
It hurts so bad!

01:05:32.161 --> 01:05:33.150
Block it up here.

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:35.993
Get me some more bags!

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:39.761
Did we get 'em?
Did we get 'em all?

01:05:40.771 --> 01:05:42.466
She was right.

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:44.768
She said that
it would happen like this.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.932
She said that
they would come at night.

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.941
She told us someone would die.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:15.631
Mommy.

01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:19.230
Ohh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:21.808
It's okay, it was just a dream.

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:24.243
It's just a bad dream.

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:27.177
I want my mommy.

01:06:27.249 --> 01:06:28.841
I know.

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:31.182
I know. Of course you do.

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:33.813
- Shh.
I wanna go home.

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:35.379
Just sleep.

01:06:36.759 --> 01:06:38.420
Everything'll be better in the morning.

01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:46.591
Think he likes you.

01:06:49.171 --> 01:06:51.696
Well, I hate that
I had to lie to him.

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:54.265
You have kids?

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:55.537
No.

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:57.772
I always wanted to, but...

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:00.542
things haven't been working out.

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:05.854
Right now I'm thinking
maybe that's for the best.

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:10.822
I saw creatures
fly into the store tonight that--

01:07:10.893 --> 01:07:12.554
they shouldn't exist.

01:07:14.063 --> 01:07:16.554
I keep thinking I'm gonna
wake up in a rubber room.

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:19.295
You're not alone in that.

01:07:20.302 --> 01:07:21.792
We're all right there with you.

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:24.668
This isn't gonna end, is it?

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:28.699
David.

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:32.009
It's Joe. He's getting worse.

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:51.866
Joe.

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:55.532
How you holdin' up, partner?

01:07:55.603 --> 01:07:58.936
David... is that you?

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:01.532
Yeah, pal, how you doin'?

01:08:02.546 --> 01:08:05.310
It's bad. He's bad.

01:08:05.381 --> 01:08:08.009
Didn't know anything
could hurt like this.

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:11.350
If you guys can't help me...

01:08:12.555 --> 01:08:14.853
you-- you gotta end it, okay?

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:19.426
Ollie's got that gun, right?

01:08:20.895 --> 01:08:23.421
Right?
- No. No way.

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:25.831
You can't fuck with me
on this, bro.

01:08:25.901 --> 01:08:28.062
Not with me like this.

01:08:28.136 --> 01:08:29.627
I'll do it.

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:32.469
Just give me the gun.

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:34.167
Hey, hey. Shh.

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:37.337
- We're not there yet, okay?
- Oh, please!

01:08:37.412 --> 01:08:39.142
Joe, now, listen.

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:41.205
Pal...

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:43.411
we're gonna work something out.

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:45.180
I just need you to hang in
a little longer, okay?

01:08:45.254 --> 01:08:46.312
Can we do that?

01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:51.853
Stay with him.
I'll be back.

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:59.224
Hattie, I need to go to the bathroom.
Will you watch Billy?

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:02.192
Hattie.

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:19.810
See anything?

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:24.188
The last of those bugs
went away about four.

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.249
Dawn's coming.

01:09:26.261 --> 01:09:27.593
What's on your mind?

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:28.652
It's Joe.

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:32.397
We don't get him
on some serious antibiotics,

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:33.627
he's gonna die of infection.

01:09:33.702 --> 01:09:36.033
Plus he needs
painkillers in the worst way.

01:09:36.104 --> 01:09:39.836
All-- all-- all we got here
is liquor and aspirin.

01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:42.776
You-- you thinkin' about goin'
to that pharmacy next door?

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.779
Irene Reppler says
they've got Silvadene--

01:09:44.846 --> 01:09:46.542
you know, the stuff
they use in burn wards.

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:47.604
She knows where they keep it.

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:48.843
Slow down.

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:50.578
You can't actually be thinkin'
of doin' this.

01:09:50.653 --> 01:09:52.553
I'm also thinkin' beyond that.

01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:54.087
We have to get out of here.

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:56.451
I mean permanently.

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:58.993
Why? We got plenty to eat!

01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:01.894
What happens when one of those things
decides to break through this window?.

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:04.558
I'm talkin' one of the big ones,
like the one that killed Norm.

01:10:04.633 --> 01:10:07.625
Yeah, and that flaming torch idea
didn't work so well, did it?

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:09.830
We almost burned
the goddamn store down.

01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:17.442
It's Hattie.

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:25.313
Here?

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:27.378
All right,
gently, now. Gently.

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:29.720
One... two... three.

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:41.531
I don't know
how long she was there like that,

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:42.935
lying there next to us.

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:44.666
I thought she was sleeping.

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:47.906
I got my 4-wheel drive.

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:49.569
It's out there.

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:51.306
Y-you're talking about leaving?

01:10:52.649 --> 01:10:54.139
Well, we...

01:10:54.216 --> 01:10:56.081
should hit the pharmacy first.

01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:57.448
We gotta bring back
supplies for the injured.

01:10:57.519 --> 01:10:58.952
I mean, if we don't,

01:10:59.021 --> 01:11:01.012
Joe Eagleton's gonna die,
and we can't let that happen.

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.084
But after that...

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.754
look, my Land Cruiser
can hold eight people.

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:08.058
I say we drive south
as far as the fuel takes us

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:09.461
and try to get clear of this mist.

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.423
That's it?

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:13.832
That's the plan?

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:15.802
- That's what I got.
- No, you can't mean it.

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:17.862
Not after what happened
to Norton and his group.

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.408
No, no, no. Amanda, think.

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:22.467
Norton got over 200 feet
from this store.

01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:24.034
That's how much rope played out.

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.638
I'm parked half that distance
from here.

01:11:26.715 --> 01:11:28.706
But who knows how far
this mist has spread?

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:30.274
It could be
the entire eastern seaboard.

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:32.513
Yeah, it could be the whole world,
for all we know.

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:35.887
Wouldn't make us any less dead,
now, would it?

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.789
We have one gun.

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.851
- How many rounds?
We got ten left.

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:41.088
Ten rounds. Jesus.

01:11:41.163 --> 01:11:42.790
Okay, so ten.

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:45.790
Want another reason
to get the hell out of here?

01:11:45.868 --> 01:11:47.893
I'll give you the best one.

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:48.959
Her.

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:51.462
Mrs. Carmody.

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:54.407
She's our very own Jim Jones.

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:57.138
I'd like to leave before people
start drinking the Kool-Aid.

01:11:57.212 --> 01:11:58.201
He's right.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.612
Flakier people get,
the better she's gonna look.

01:12:00.683 --> 01:12:03.345
No, I don't buy that.
It's obvious she's nuts.

01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:04.909
Look, a few people maybe, but--

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:07.285
No, I count four.
She's preachin' to 'em right now.

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:08.846
By noon, she'll have four more.

01:12:08.924 --> 01:12:11.085
By tomorrow night,
when those things come back,

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.650
she'll have a congregation,

01:12:12.728 --> 01:12:16.220
and then we can start worryin'
about who she's gonna sacrifice

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:17.959
to make it all better.

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:19.694
Hmm?

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:21.702
You, Amanda?

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:23.032
My little boy?

01:12:23.105 --> 01:12:24.697
He's right.

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:26.934
You don't have much faith
in humanity, do you?

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:29.342
None whatsoever.

01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:30.901
I can't accept that.

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:33.675
People are
basically good, decent.

01:12:33.748 --> 01:12:35.978
My God, David,
we're a civilized society.

01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:37.541
Sure, as long as
the machines are workin'

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:38.881
and you can dial 9-1-1,

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:41.821
but you take those things away,
you throw people in the dark,

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:43.881
you scare the shit out of them,

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:45.790
no more rules,

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:47.852
you'll see how primitive they get.

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:50.626
You scare people badly enough,

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:53.190
you can get 'em to do anything.

01:12:53.268 --> 01:12:56.931
They'll turn to whoever
promises a solution,

01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:58.165
or whatever.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.231
Ollie, please, back me up here.

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:02.004
I wish I could.

01:13:02.077 --> 01:13:04.409
As a species,
we're fundamentally insane.

01:13:05.414 --> 01:13:07.473
Put more than two of us
in a room, we pick sides

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:10.109
and start dreaming up reasons
to kill one another.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.782
Why do you think we invented
politics and religion?

01:13:13.856 --> 01:13:16.484
Oh, Jesus, that's just...

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:17.547
wrong.

01:13:17.626 --> 01:13:20.186
Look, nobody has
to decide anything now, okay?

01:13:20.262 --> 01:13:21.752
First things first--

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:23.320
the pharmacy.

01:13:24.933 --> 01:13:26.594
That'll be our test run.

01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:27.657
Okay?

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.710
It's all right, Big Bill.

01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:41.443
I'm gonna bring you back
some comic books.

01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:42.848
I don't want them.

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:44.579
I want you to stay here.

01:13:44.653 --> 01:13:46.644
I won't be gone long.

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:49.724
Just-- just next door.

01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:51.623
Hey, you'll be safe.

01:13:53.228 --> 01:13:54.217
Daddy--

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:55.786
Daddy, there are things out there.

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:58.699
Things--

01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:01.668
Yeah. There's a lot
less of 'em in the daytime.

01:14:03.238 --> 01:14:04.262
They'll wait.

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:06.000
They'll wait in the mist
where you can't see 'em,

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:08.508
and then when you go
and can't get back in...

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:10.067
they'll come and eat you up!

01:14:10.145 --> 01:14:12.375
- Shh.
- Daddy, don't go!

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:22.917
I'll be back.

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:25.521
Big Bill...

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:26.856
I promise.

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:29.261
I'll be back, and then
I'm gonna take you home.

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:31.857
All right?

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:33.993
Together, we're going home.

01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:37.062
If something happens,
anything at all,

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:38.299
you cut and run.

01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:41.001
You get your ass back in here,
for your boy's sake.

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:43.567
If something happens to me,
I want you to take care of Billy...

01:14:44.612 --> 01:14:47.604
best as you can,
and long as you can.

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:49.447
Land Cruiser's yours now.

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:52.077
You-- you get him out of here.

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:53.485
You just keep drivin'.

01:15:00.062 --> 01:15:02.053
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. David Drayton?

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:05.156
Are you so anxious
to make your boy an orphan?

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:07.327
My boy is no concern of yours.

01:15:07.402 --> 01:15:08.664
Listen up.

01:15:08.737 --> 01:15:10.728
We're going to the pharmacy.

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:12.797
We're gonna bring back
some supplies.

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:16.242
Also, there may be people
trapped over there who need help.

01:15:16.311 --> 01:15:18.472
Listen, folks, listen!

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:20.538
We're not gonna take any chances.

01:15:20.616 --> 01:15:22.106
If there's any trouble,

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:24.175
we'll come straight back here
to the supermarket.

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:27.586
And bring the fiends of hell
down on our heads, thank you.

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:29.146
She's right.

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:30.885
You'll make 'em notice us.

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:32.221
You'll make 'em come.

01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:35.924
Why can't you just leave
well enough alone?

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:37.863
Lady, this what you call
'well enough"?

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:39.423
You wanna stop us?

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:40.991
You better explain to Bobby here

01:15:41.069 --> 01:15:43.333
why we're not bringin' painkillers
and medicine back for his brother.

01:15:43.405 --> 01:15:45.566
I'm goin', even if I have to go alone.

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.370
You'll die out there, young man.

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:50.502
You'll walk out that door
and be torn to shreds,

01:15:50.578 --> 01:15:53.741
and then your hell-bound pride
will have them come get the rest of us.

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:56.682
Yes, they'll come back for all of us,
just like this good lady said.

01:15:56.752 --> 01:15:58.743
Do you want that
to happen, people?

01:15:58.819 --> 01:16:02.016
No!
No! No! No!

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:04.081
Well, it is this kind of hubris

01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:06.593
that brought the wrath of God
in the first place.

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:08.323
This kind of pride and defiance of--

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:11.827
Shut up, you miserable buzzard!

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.765
You old bitch!

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:20.400
Stoning people who piss you off
is perfectly okay.

01:16:20.475 --> 01:16:22.136
They do it in the Bible, don't they?

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:24.041
And I got lots of peas.

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:26.706
David, please, if you want to go,
now's the time.

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:28.511
How 'bout it, Army?

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:30.074
Any help from the armed forces?

01:16:30.152 --> 01:16:31.141
I'll go.

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:35.079
Jim Grondin.

01:16:35.157 --> 01:16:36.647
I had you in school, didn't I?

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:38.693
Yes'm, me and my sister Pauline.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.421
Pair of underachievers.

01:16:40.495 --> 01:16:41.723
After you, Jim.

01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:44.197
Yes, ma'am.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:45.597
Oh, shit.

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:48.067
That it?
That's everybody?

01:16:48.136 --> 01:16:49.626
Everybody that's goin'.

01:16:49.706 --> 01:16:51.731
Yep.
- Okay.

01:16:51.807 --> 01:16:54.867
Single file,
one by one, all right?

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:56.672
Let's get this thing over with.

01:16:57.813 --> 01:16:58.802
Let's go.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.711
After you.
Yes.

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:04.741
Stay together.

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:09.756
You know what?

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:11.315
Mrs. Carmody, you're not helping.

01:17:11.393 --> 01:17:13.088
Shut the hell up!
- You shut up!

01:17:19.901 --> 01:17:21.232
Save the batteries.

01:18:08.717 --> 01:18:10.309
Shit.

01:18:10.385 --> 01:18:12.376
They left the doors propped open.

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:15.246
Think something got in?

01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:19.750
Let's just...
get what we need,

01:18:19.828 --> 01:18:21.227
get the hell outta here.

01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:22.786
Yeah. Let's do that.

01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:25.697
The meds
are over at the end there,

01:18:25.767 --> 01:18:27.257
in the cubicle.

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:49.087
Will you not do that?

01:18:49.157 --> 01:18:51.148
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:53.194
Oh, God.

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.217
Where's that Silvadene?

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:20.777
It's over behind David.

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:22.687
In the fridge. Check there.

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:30.263
Silvadene. Got it.

01:19:30.831 --> 01:19:32.890
- Good.
- Ollie, what are we lookin' for?

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:34.458
Penicillin.
Yeah.

01:19:34.536 --> 01:19:36.026
Any strong antibiotics.

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:37.093
Yeah.

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:41.275
Pain meds like
Vicodin or OxyContin.

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:42.833
Shh!
- OxyContin!

01:19:44.578 --> 01:19:46.341
Hydrochloride?

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:49.839
Penicillin.

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:02.118
Guys.

01:20:06.001 --> 01:20:07.628
Hurry it up.
I hear something.

01:20:11.506 --> 01:20:12.495
What?

01:20:14.775 --> 01:20:16.333
Somethin' fuckin' weird.

01:20:25.914 --> 01:20:27.745
Oh, God.

01:20:27.916 --> 01:20:29.213
Oh, God!

01:20:29.284 --> 01:20:33.243
No. Oh, no.

01:20:33.321 --> 01:20:35.084
Oh, nooooo.

01:20:35.157 --> 01:20:36.715
Oh, fuck.

01:20:38.593 --> 01:20:40.561
Look.
There's another one.

01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:43.393
Oh, my God.
No, no, no.

01:20:43.465 --> 01:20:45.831
Oh, no, no.

01:20:46.401 --> 01:20:49.564
Guys, let's get out of here now.

01:20:50.639 --> 01:20:52.504
- Aaaahhhhhh!
Holy shit!

01:20:56.478 --> 01:20:59.140
Shit! Shit! Oh, shit!

01:20:59.214 --> 01:21:03.583
M.P '.. I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Help me!

01:21:03.652 --> 01:21:05.745
Good Lord!
Help him!

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.027
Son of a bitch!

01:21:13.094 --> 01:21:14.686
This stuff ain't comin' off!

01:21:15.697 --> 01:21:18.097
Oh, man!
He's glued to this fuckin' post!

01:21:18.166 --> 01:21:19.997
It's our fault.

01:21:20.068 --> 01:21:22.127
It's all our fault.

01:21:22.204 --> 01:21:23.671
It's really stuck.

01:21:28.009 --> 01:21:30.000
M.P '.. God, I can feel 'em!

01:21:30.078 --> 01:21:32.103
I can feel 'em!

01:21:33.748 --> 01:21:35.682
Oh, my God!
Jesus!

01:21:42.858 --> 01:21:44.416
Oh, my God.

01:21:44.493 --> 01:21:46.984
Ohh! I--

01:21:48.063 --> 01:21:49.496
Aaahhhh!

01:21:50.532 --> 01:21:53.023
Aah! Aaaaahhhhhh!

01:21:56.304 --> 01:21:58.295
There's more!

01:21:58.373 --> 01:21:59.362
Ohh!

01:22:06.882 --> 01:22:08.213
Aah! Aah!

01:22:08.283 --> 01:22:09.511
There's another one!
Hit it!

01:22:11.419 --> 01:22:13.717
- Aah!
- What the hell is that stuff?

01:22:13.787 --> 01:22:15.652
Ollie! One over there!

01:22:15.724 --> 01:22:17.316
Ollie, there!

01:22:17.392 --> 01:22:19.087
Got it!

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:21.651
There, there, there!
Shoot! Shoot!

01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:23.595
Shit!

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:26.489
See 'em?

01:22:28.136 --> 01:22:31.333
- Aah! Aaaahhhhh!
- Bobby!

01:22:31.406 --> 01:22:32.896
Bobby!

01:22:38.079 --> 01:22:40.570
- Aaahhhh!
- Hold on, man! Hold on!

01:22:40.650 --> 01:22:42.379
- Hold on, man!
- Cut the strand!

01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:43.439
Help me!

01:22:44.787 --> 01:22:46.550
Let's get out of here!

01:22:48.523 --> 01:22:50.889
- A belt! Who's got a belt?
- I got a belt!

01:22:52.494 --> 01:22:55.691
Aaaaahhhhhh!

01:22:55.764 --> 01:22:57.095
I got him, I got him.
Hold on.

01:22:58.433 --> 01:22:59.866
Pull it tight!

01:23:01.436 --> 01:23:03.063
Look! Look!

01:23:03.138 --> 01:23:05.766
Aaahhh! Aaaaahhhhhh!

01:23:07.108 --> 01:23:08.973
Ohhhhhh!

01:23:09.044 --> 01:23:10.739
Gaaahhhh!

01:23:10.812 --> 01:23:12.439
Light!

01:23:12.514 --> 01:23:13.503
Light!

01:23:13.582 --> 01:23:16.107
God!

01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:22.383
We gotta get outta here!
Come on!

01:23:22.457 --> 01:23:24.925
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:23:25.493 --> 01:23:26.960
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

01:23:38.239 --> 01:23:39.672
Let's get out of here!

01:23:40.674 --> 01:23:43.768
All right, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Come on!

01:23:43.845 --> 01:23:45.005
Come on!

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.211
Oh, my God!

01:23:55.924 --> 01:23:57.585
Ollie! Ollie!

01:24:02.063 --> 01:24:03.963
Kill it! Kill it!

01:24:14.676 --> 01:24:15.665
Fuckers!

01:24:15.777 --> 01:24:16.835
Oh, no! Oh, God, he's dead!

01:24:16.911 --> 01:24:19.573
He's dead! Get out of here!
Let's go, let's go!

01:24:19.648 --> 01:24:21.479
Drayton, come on,
come on, come on!

01:24:21.549 --> 01:24:23.039
Come on, Drayton,
he's dead!

01:24:23.118 --> 01:24:24.107
Come on!

01:24:55.316 --> 01:24:56.647
Open the door!

01:24:58.286 --> 01:24:59.480
Where's Bobby?

01:24:59.555 --> 01:25:00.544
Daddy!

01:25:02.057 --> 01:25:03.046
Close up the doors!

01:25:03.158 --> 01:25:04.147
Hurry up!

01:25:04.225 --> 01:25:05.783
What happened?

01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:08.590
They're dead!
They're all dead!

01:25:25.547 --> 01:25:27.538
...expiation, because we have seen

01:25:27.615 --> 01:25:30.140
the earth scourged
with whips and scorpions.

01:25:30.218 --> 01:25:34.245
We have seen the earth
vomit forth from her lips

01:25:34.322 --> 01:25:36.313
obscenities and profanities

01:25:36.391 --> 01:25:38.723
of such nightmare proportions.

01:25:38.794 --> 01:25:42.628
And for these evil,
lurking spirits,

01:25:42.698 --> 01:25:44.689
and for these evil people...

01:25:44.765 --> 01:25:46.096
How long was I out?

01:25:46.167 --> 01:25:47.566
Most of the day.

01:25:48.636 --> 01:25:51.127
You just came over here to lay down
and went to sleep.

01:25:51.206 --> 01:25:52.867
Just passed out, is more like it.

01:25:52.941 --> 01:25:54.408
What will stop this Great Whore?

01:25:54.476 --> 01:25:56.569
Just shut down for a while.

01:25:56.644 --> 01:25:57.633
Sorry.

01:25:57.711 --> 01:25:59.076
How will it end?

01:25:59.147 --> 01:26:00.136
Expiation!

01:26:00.215 --> 01:26:02.843
Expiation!
Do you remember yesterday when...

01:26:02.917 --> 01:26:04.612
How's Joe?

01:26:04.685 --> 01:26:08.086
Dead. Joe died of his burns
while you were asleep.

01:26:08.656 --> 01:26:10.487
We were just too late.

01:26:10.558 --> 01:26:11.889
I told you this would come!

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.360
Oh, God,
I thought I was dreaming her voice.

01:26:14.429 --> 01:26:15.760
No dream.

01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:18.025
She's getting people whipped up.

01:26:18.099 --> 01:26:20.863
That poor girl is dead,

01:26:20.935 --> 01:26:23.301
and that boy is burnt in the back room!

01:26:23.371 --> 01:26:25.532
She's got 'em believing
she's a psychic,

01:26:25.607 --> 01:26:27.268
she has a direct line with God.

01:26:27.342 --> 01:26:29.833
Why wouldn't they?
Woman never shuts up.

01:26:29.911 --> 01:26:32.209
Like those speeches
Castro used to make.

01:26:34.949 --> 01:26:38.248
Ollie says you're thinking of leaving.

01:26:38.319 --> 01:26:39.650
I'm in.

01:26:39.721 --> 01:26:41.689
No. Sorry.

01:26:41.756 --> 01:26:45.590
I mean, come on, you saw what
happened to Bobby... Mike...

01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:46.649
I won't...

01:26:46.728 --> 01:26:49.424
do that again.
I won't be responsible.

01:26:49.497 --> 01:26:50.964
You might want to reconsider that.

01:26:51.032 --> 01:26:53.193
What will-- what will keep these evil,

01:26:53.268 --> 01:26:54.428
these abominations at bay?

01:26:54.502 --> 01:26:55.992
What will keep them away?

01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:59.062
"The rock will not hide them.
The dead tree gives no shelter."

01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:00.539
What will end it?
Let me hear it.

01:27:00.608 --> 01:27:02.508
- Expiation!
- What are we talking about?

01:27:02.677 --> 01:27:05.168
- Expiation!
- Say it again like you mean it!

01:27:05.246 --> 01:27:06.543
Expiation!

01:27:06.614 --> 01:27:11.608
Welcome to Sesame Street.
Today's word is "expiation."

01:27:11.686 --> 01:27:13.711
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

01:27:13.788 --> 01:27:16.450
That boy hasn't been right
since the pharmacy.

01:27:16.524 --> 01:27:19.516
His mind's just snapped.
Gone.

01:27:19.594 --> 01:27:21.084
Hasn't even been two days.

01:27:22.197 --> 01:27:23.687
Not even two days.

01:27:23.766 --> 01:27:26.360
I'm not spendin' the rest
of my life here, I'll tell you what.

01:27:26.434 --> 01:27:29.096
I can quietly gather up
some bags of groceries

01:27:29.170 --> 01:27:32.503
and hide them up at one of
the check stands by the door.

01:27:32.574 --> 01:27:34.838
It was your idea.
It's your vehicle.

01:27:34.909 --> 01:27:36.399
It'll be your call.

01:27:38.379 --> 01:27:40.904
I'd rather die out there trying
than in here waiting.

01:27:43.051 --> 01:27:45.315
Who will save them? No one.

01:27:45.386 --> 01:27:48.480
The rocks will not hide them.

01:27:48.556 --> 01:27:51.320
I want some idea
of what we're up against.

01:27:51.392 --> 01:27:53.053
I want to know what this mist is.

01:27:54.395 --> 01:27:55.555
I want to talk to the soldiers.

01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:57.119
Soldiers? What's that gonna do?

01:27:57.198 --> 01:27:59.428
You heard what that M.P. said
at the pharmacy.

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:01.832
David, I'm not even sure
I knew he was talking.

01:28:01.903 --> 01:28:03.564
The situation was insane.

01:28:03.639 --> 01:28:05.436
He said he was sorry.

01:28:05.506 --> 01:28:07.497
Wasn't that the word
he used-- "sorry"?

01:28:07.575 --> 01:28:09.566
That's right.
He said it was their fault, right?

01:28:09.644 --> 01:28:11.202
What did he mean by that?

01:28:11.279 --> 01:28:13.770
That's what we're gonna find out.

01:28:13.848 --> 01:28:15.509
Irene, stay with Billy, please.

01:28:15.582 --> 01:28:16.879
Verse 17!

01:28:16.951 --> 01:28:19.442
"...poured out his vial into the air,

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:21.420
"and there came a great voice

01:28:21.489 --> 01:28:24.219
"out of the temple of heaven
from the throne, saying,

01:28:24.292 --> 01:28:26.783
"'It is done! It is done!'

01:28:26.861 --> 01:28:30.092
"And there were voices
and lightning,

01:28:30.164 --> 01:28:33.224
and thunders,
and a great earthquake."

01:28:33.301 --> 01:28:35.963
Yes! Come to me!

01:28:36.037 --> 01:28:37.197
What?

01:28:37.272 --> 01:28:39.502
- Where's your friends?
- I ain't seen 'em.

01:28:39.575 --> 01:28:41.839
Not that big a store.
It's kinda hard to lose.

01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:44.902
I ain't seen 'em, I said.
I look like their keeper?

01:28:48.049 --> 01:28:51.041
- What do you want from me?
- What do you know about this mist?

01:28:51.119 --> 01:28:53.553
I don't know nothin'.
I got nothin' to do with it.

01:28:53.621 --> 01:28:55.384
That's not what the M.P.
said in the pharmacy

01:28:55.456 --> 01:28:57.287
before the spiders
came out of his skin.

01:28:58.826 --> 01:29:00.589
They're not in the store.

01:29:00.662 --> 01:29:03.825
The only place we haven't looked
is the loading dock.

01:29:03.898 --> 01:29:04.887
...because you know.

01:29:04.966 --> 01:29:07.127
You saw the good face
of God tonight.

01:29:07.201 --> 01:29:08.463
Yes? Tell us.

01:29:08.536 --> 01:29:10.766
Here is an old man
who has seen!

01:29:10.837 --> 01:29:12.998
Yes, he has seen!

01:29:13.074 --> 01:29:14.063
Amen.

01:29:14.142 --> 01:29:15.632
And I want to say,

01:29:15.710 --> 01:29:17.837
do I want to walk with you

01:29:17.912 --> 01:29:20.574
into my Father's hands?

01:29:21.149 --> 01:29:22.138
Morales.

01:29:23.184 --> 01:29:24.173
Donaldson.

01:29:26.855 --> 01:29:27.844
Guys...

01:29:30.191 --> 01:29:31.681
It's the only place they can be.

01:29:32.694 --> 01:29:33.718
What?

01:29:33.795 --> 01:29:35.228
Couldn't just disappear.

01:29:35.296 --> 01:29:38.288
Look, I told you,
okay, I don't know where they are--

01:29:45.373 --> 01:29:46.863
I didn't think they'd do it.

01:29:46.941 --> 01:29:49.501
They said they would do it,
and I just--

01:29:49.577 --> 01:29:51.738
I told them what
the M.P. said at the pharmacy,

01:29:51.813 --> 01:29:52.973
and they swore they'd do it.

01:29:53.047 --> 01:29:54.708
I just-- I didn't think they would.

01:29:54.783 --> 01:29:55.772
Jesus.

01:29:55.850 --> 01:29:59.047
It's the Arrowhead Project,
isn't it?

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:02.715
This mist, it's some kind of, what,
military fuckup?

01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:04.280
What were you guys
messin' with up there, huh?

01:30:04.359 --> 01:30:07.226
We got you now,
you sorry son of a bitch!

01:30:07.295 --> 01:30:08.284
Get in there!

01:30:08.363 --> 01:30:11.355
It was them!
It was them what done it to us!

01:30:11.432 --> 01:30:14.924
It was them what brung down
the final wrath upon us!

01:30:15.003 --> 01:30:17.494
Those two peckerwoods that
he's been with this whole time,

01:30:17.573 --> 01:30:19.973
they hung themselves in the back
because they knew!

01:30:20.041 --> 01:30:21.531
They knew it all along!

01:30:21.609 --> 01:30:23.440
- He's crazy. He doesn't know--
- Get on your knees!

01:30:23.511 --> 01:30:24.842
Stay out of it, Drayton!

01:30:24.912 --> 01:30:26.903
They heard it too, didn't you?
All of ya!

01:30:26.981 --> 01:30:28.346
All about the Arrowhead Project

01:30:28.416 --> 01:30:30.475
and all that secret shit
up on the mountain.

01:30:30.551 --> 01:30:32.018
That's what brung it down on us.

01:30:32.086 --> 01:30:34.213
That's what brung down
the wrath of God!

01:30:34.288 --> 01:30:35.277
Oh!

01:30:37.091 --> 01:30:39.025
Private Jessup.

01:30:40.928 --> 01:30:42.088
It wasn't me.

01:30:42.163 --> 01:30:44.495
I'm just--
I'm stationed up there.

01:30:44.565 --> 01:30:45.964
I'm not responsible--

01:30:46.034 --> 01:30:47.695
- Bullshit!
- Hell, I'm a local!

01:30:47.770 --> 01:30:49.761
Most of you people know me.

01:30:49.837 --> 01:30:52.328
You stop your chicken shit whining

01:30:52.407 --> 01:30:55.035
or I will cut your puling tongue out.

01:30:55.109 --> 01:30:56.667
Now you tell us!

01:30:58.679 --> 01:30:59.873
Tell us.

01:30:59.947 --> 01:31:02.609
Look, look. Okay, okay.

01:31:02.683 --> 01:31:04.116
I heard stuff.

01:31:04.185 --> 01:31:05.482
Stuff?

01:31:05.553 --> 01:31:07.544
Yes, we all heard stuff.

01:31:08.890 --> 01:31:12.656
Like how they, um,

01:31:12.727 --> 01:31:14.820
how they thought
that there were other dimensions,

01:31:14.895 --> 01:31:17.728
you know, other--
other worlds all around us,

01:31:17.799 --> 01:31:20.290
and how they wanted
to try and make, um,

01:31:20.368 --> 01:31:21.858
a window--

01:31:21.936 --> 01:31:24.530
you know, so they could look through
and see what's on the other side.

01:31:26.741 --> 01:31:29.471
Well, maybe your window
turned out to be a door. Didn't it?

01:31:29.544 --> 01:31:31.409
Not mine! Those scientists'!

01:31:31.479 --> 01:31:34.004
Oh, the scientists!
Yes, the scientists!

01:31:34.082 --> 01:31:36.209
They must have ripped
a hole open by accident.

01:31:36.284 --> 01:31:38.081
This other world
came spilling through to ours.

01:31:38.152 --> 01:31:41.485
That's what Donaldson was saying
to me right before he killed himself.

01:31:41.556 --> 01:31:43.547
I didn't understand the half of it.

01:31:45.493 --> 01:31:47.017
It ain't my fault!

01:31:47.095 --> 01:31:48.153
Oh.

01:31:49.263 --> 01:31:52.596
Ain't. His. Fault.

01:31:52.667 --> 01:31:55.192
No, no, no.

01:31:55.269 --> 01:31:56.634
Ain't nothin'

01:31:56.704 --> 01:31:59.298
ever anybody's fault.

01:31:59.373 --> 01:32:01.705
But he denies it.

01:32:01.776 --> 01:32:04.267
He points the finger,

01:32:04.345 --> 01:32:07.439
this Judas in our midst.

01:32:07.515 --> 01:32:08.504
Judas!

01:32:08.583 --> 01:32:10.448
David!

01:32:10.518 --> 01:32:12.748
You! You!

01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:14.754
Don't you know by now?.

01:32:14.822 --> 01:32:16.915
Don't you know the truth?

01:32:16.991 --> 01:32:19.585
We are being punished.

01:32:19.659 --> 01:32:23.220
For what? For going
against the will of God!

01:32:23.297 --> 01:32:27.563
For going against
his forbidden rules of old!

01:32:27.636 --> 01:32:29.126
Walking on the moon!

01:32:29.203 --> 01:32:30.693
Yes! Yes!

01:32:30.771 --> 01:32:33.672
- Or-- or splitting his atoms!
Amen!

01:32:33.741 --> 01:32:36.141
Or-- or-- or stem cells

01:32:36.210 --> 01:32:38.474
and abortions!

01:32:38.546 --> 01:32:41.515
And destroying the secrets of life

01:32:41.582 --> 01:32:44.847
that only God above has any right to!

01:32:44.919 --> 01:32:46.409
Amen! Amen!

01:32:46.487 --> 01:32:49.047
Yes, I know! It is true!

01:32:49.123 --> 01:32:51.614
And now we are being punished.

01:32:51.691 --> 01:32:54.683
The judgment is being
brought down upon us.

01:32:54.761 --> 01:32:57.423
The fiends of hell,
you see they are let loose,

01:32:57.498 --> 01:33:01.093
and star Wormwood blazes!

01:33:01.169 --> 01:33:02.500
And it is his fault!

01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:05.903
No! No! It is not my fault! No!

01:33:05.973 --> 01:33:08.965
They did it! They spit
in the eye of the Almighty!

01:33:09.043 --> 01:33:10.032
No!

01:33:10.111 --> 01:33:12.306
Get over there!

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:13.972
No!

01:33:14.048 --> 01:33:15.675
Judas!

01:33:16.984 --> 01:33:17.973
Jim!

01:33:18.052 --> 01:33:20.520
Kill him! String him up!

01:33:23.591 --> 01:33:25.252
Stand up, you coward!

01:33:25.326 --> 01:33:26.315
Unkh!

01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:30.990
Jesus!

01:33:33.968 --> 01:33:35.196
No!

01:33:35.269 --> 01:33:36.668
Aaaahhhh!

01:33:36.737 --> 01:33:38.898
Expiation!

01:33:39.473 --> 01:33:40.565
- No!
Stab him!

01:33:42.143 --> 01:33:44.077
- Aaahhhh!
- Expiation!

01:33:44.145 --> 01:33:46.875
Feed him to the beast!

01:33:46.948 --> 01:33:48.882
Expiation!

01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:52.909
Let the abominations
smell his blood!

01:33:54.422 --> 01:33:56.083
No, no! No!

01:33:56.157 --> 01:33:58.751
Aaaaahhhhh!

01:33:58.826 --> 01:34:02.057
- Jesus! Wait!
- No, David!

01:34:06.701 --> 01:34:09.295
Aaahhhh!

01:34:20.181 --> 01:34:21.910
Aaahhhh!

01:34:31.459 --> 01:34:33.484
Aah! Aaahhh!

01:34:33.561 --> 01:34:36.553
Aaahhhh!

01:34:37.732 --> 01:34:39.723
Aaahhh! Aah!

01:34:58.819 --> 01:35:00.218
Please.

01:35:10.865 --> 01:35:13.527
The beast will leave us alone tonight.

01:35:15.036 --> 01:35:16.025
Tomorrow...

01:35:17.371 --> 01:35:19.862
tomorrow, we'll just
have to wait and see.

01:35:29.216 --> 01:35:30.376
Daddy.

01:35:32.053 --> 01:35:33.213
Daddy.

01:35:45.066 --> 01:35:46.897
Sorry I left you, pal.

01:35:49.236 --> 01:35:50.897
I'll never leave you again.

01:35:52.239 --> 01:35:53.399
Promise?

01:35:54.809 --> 01:35:58.506
But you have to give me
your best promise, okay?

01:35:58.579 --> 01:36:02.015
Your very best promise,
and can never break it.

01:36:02.083 --> 01:36:03.812
Tell me.

01:36:05.519 --> 01:36:07.851
Promise you won't let
the monsters get me.

01:36:11.525 --> 01:36:13.686
Ever. No matter what.

01:36:15.363 --> 01:36:16.853
I promise.

01:36:20.101 --> 01:36:21.898
I love you, Daddy.

01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:23.869
I love you, Billy.

01:36:24.872 --> 01:36:26.203
More than anything.

01:36:55.903 --> 01:36:57.063
It's dawn.

01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:05.343
Hey, pal,
you ready to go home?

01:37:05.413 --> 01:37:06.778
Come on.

01:37:09.183 --> 01:37:12.175
Okay, I got the groceries
hidden at check stand number two.

01:37:12.253 --> 01:37:14.744
Five bags. We can grab 'em
and get out the door.

01:37:14.822 --> 01:37:16.119
Okay.

01:37:16.190 --> 01:37:19.921
My car's parked in the center lane
of the parking lot, far end.

01:37:19.994 --> 01:37:22.326
Whoever gets there first,
open up both doors,

01:37:22.396 --> 01:37:24.921
and we'll all pile in
as fast as we can, okay?

01:37:24.999 --> 01:37:26.159
Let's go.

01:37:49.557 --> 01:37:51.752
Stealing food now?.

01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:58.021
Going out now, Mrs. Carmody.

01:37:59.333 --> 01:38:00.994
Please stand aside.

01:38:02.403 --> 01:38:04.963
You can't go out.
I won't allow it.

01:38:05.039 --> 01:38:06.370
Won't allow it?

01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:09.102
It's against God's will.

01:38:09.176 --> 01:38:11.303
Don't you know that by now?.

01:38:11.378 --> 01:38:15.940
Haven't I proven myself
again and again and again?

01:38:16.016 --> 01:38:20.453
Haven't I shown that I am his vessel?

01:38:25.359 --> 01:38:26.849
What's the matter with you?

01:38:30.197 --> 01:38:31.630
Don't you believe in God?

01:38:32.633 --> 01:38:34.191
No one's interfered with you.

01:38:34.268 --> 01:38:36.862
All we're asking for
is the same privilege.

01:38:36.937 --> 01:38:38.268
You heard him.

01:38:39.874 --> 01:38:43.867
It is these people
who brought this upon us.

01:38:45.145 --> 01:38:46.134
They--

01:38:46.213 --> 01:38:50.149
people who refused to bend
to the will of God,

01:38:50.217 --> 01:38:52.811
and claim it privilege.

01:38:52.887 --> 01:38:55.879
Sinners in pride.

01:38:55.956 --> 01:38:57.947
Yes, haughty.

01:38:58.025 --> 01:38:59.652
Privileged!

01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:03.994
They mock us. They mock our--
our God, our faith,

01:39:04.064 --> 01:39:07.500
our values, our very lifestyle.

01:39:07.568 --> 01:39:09.729
They mock our humility

01:39:09.803 --> 01:39:11.634
and our piousness.

01:39:11.705 --> 01:39:14.868
They piss on us and laugh.

01:39:18.112 --> 01:39:19.773
It's from them

01:39:19.847 --> 01:39:23.374
the blood of human sacrifice
must come.

01:39:23.450 --> 01:39:25.418
From them...

01:39:25.486 --> 01:39:28.080
- Come on.
-...the blood of expiation.

01:39:28.155 --> 01:39:29.144
Come on.

01:39:29.223 --> 01:39:30.781
You try it.

01:39:30.857 --> 01:39:32.188
Fuckin' try it!

01:39:32.259 --> 01:39:33.726
Come on!

01:39:33.793 --> 01:39:36.023
Get 'em!
- We want the boy.

01:39:36.096 --> 01:39:37.358
- We want the boy!
- You get back!

01:39:37.532 --> 01:39:39.625
- Yeah!
- You get back!

01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:40.632
The boy!

01:39:42.202 --> 01:39:44.067
Grab that boy! Grab him!

01:39:48.108 --> 01:39:49.439
Grab him!

01:39:51.045 --> 01:39:52.910
And get the whore too!

01:39:52.979 --> 01:39:54.446
Grab her!

01:39:54.515 --> 01:39:56.949
Kill 'em! Kill 'em all!

01:40:11.999 --> 01:40:13.830
Stay down!
Stay down! Stay down!

01:40:20.741 --> 01:40:22.402
I-- I killed her.

01:40:24.578 --> 01:40:25.567
Thank you, Ollie.

01:40:27.749 --> 01:40:29.011
Let's go.

01:40:30.084 --> 01:40:33.281
Get that ice machine
out of the way, please.

01:40:35.756 --> 01:40:37.451
You killed her!

01:40:37.524 --> 01:40:39.856
You murdered her!

01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:44.920
I wouldn't have shot her, Dave,

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.627
not if there'd been any other way.

01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:48.190
That's why I said thank you.

01:40:48.268 --> 01:40:49.428
Okay.

01:40:49.503 --> 01:40:51.835
Okay, then...
let's go!

01:40:53.808 --> 01:40:54.797
Get up, Myron!

01:40:54.874 --> 01:40:56.136
Come on! We gotta go!

01:40:56.210 --> 01:40:57.199
My ankle!

01:41:05.686 --> 01:41:07.813
Okay. All the way down!

01:41:08.856 --> 01:41:10.483
Where are they?

01:41:10.557 --> 01:41:12.388
Bud! Myron!

01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:13.484
Ambrose!

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.152
I think I broke it!

01:41:15.229 --> 01:41:16.787
Come on! Come on!

01:41:16.863 --> 01:41:18.353
We gotta go!
Come on, come on!

01:41:18.432 --> 01:41:19.660
They're lost!

01:41:27.374 --> 01:41:29.001
- Oh, Jesus.
- Ollie!

01:41:29.076 --> 01:41:31.636
Ollie!

01:41:31.711 --> 01:41:33.702
Aaahhhh!

01:41:33.781 --> 01:41:35.715
Aaaaahhhhhh!

01:41:35.783 --> 01:41:37.808
- Oh!
- Aaahhh!

01:41:49.730 --> 01:41:50.719
Ohh!

01:41:50.798 --> 01:41:53.198
Aaah! Aaaahhhh!

01:41:55.602 --> 01:41:57.661
Aaah! Aaaaahhhhh!

01:42:11.385 --> 01:42:12.716
All that screaming!

01:42:13.888 --> 01:42:16.186
Are they out there?
Can they see us?

01:42:26.066 --> 01:42:28.466
Let me-- let me in!
Let me in!

01:42:42.916 --> 01:42:44.406
Are we going?

01:42:51.258 --> 01:42:52.520
- No.
- Yeah.

01:42:52.594 --> 01:42:54.687
- No! No!
- Yeah!

01:42:54.763 --> 01:42:56.094
- Daddy.
- David.

01:42:56.163 --> 01:42:58.097
- David, no.
- Daddy, no.

01:42:58.165 --> 01:42:59.928
- David!
- Daddy!

01:43:00.001 --> 01:43:01.491
Get back in the car!

01:43:01.568 --> 01:43:03.229
- Daddy!
- David!

01:43:13.546 --> 01:43:15.241
Oh, my God!

01:43:15.315 --> 01:43:16.612
Aaahhh!

01:43:18.085 --> 01:43:20.076
Oh, my God!

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:41.229
We gotta go.

01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:42.428
I told her I'd fix it.

01:45:45.832 --> 01:45:47.766
Frontwindow...

01:45:47.834 --> 01:45:49.165
broken open.

01:45:52.906 --> 01:45:54.066
Tree.

01:45:56.243 --> 01:45:57.232
My...

01:45:58.312 --> 01:45:59.643
grandfather's tree.

01:46:14.696 --> 01:46:18.029
I'm sorry, David,
I'm just so sorry.

01:46:33.113 --> 01:46:34.102
Let's, uh...

01:46:36.450 --> 01:46:37.610
see how far this...

01:46:39.386 --> 01:46:41.581
fuel takes us, huh?

01:46:44.726 --> 01:46:46.717
Maybe we'll get clear of the mist.

01:50:03.056 --> 01:50:04.216
Well...

01:50:05.458 --> 01:50:07.449
we gave it a good shot.

01:50:08.895 --> 01:50:10.385
Nobody can say we didn't.

01:50:12.399 --> 01:50:14.094
Nope.

01:50:14.167 --> 01:50:15.998
Nobody can say that.

01:51:45.091 --> 01:51:46.080
Well...

01:51:48.261 --> 01:51:49.785
We got, uh...

01:51:54.267 --> 01:51:55.256
four.

01:51:59.939 --> 01:52:00.928
Four bullets.

01:52:05.545 --> 01:52:07.035
But there's five of us.

01:52:17.556 --> 01:52:19.319
I'll figure something out.

01:53:27.227 --> 01:53:29.889
Aaaaahhhhh!

01:53:30.930 --> 01:53:32.261
Aaahhh!

01:54:18.044 --> 01:54:19.534
Come on!
