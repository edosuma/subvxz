03:56.320 --> 03:57.720
Exactly.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.040
That was your mother's favourite.

She called it her little light.

forbearance, force when necessary...
Sweet gods, no.

12:43.080 --> 12:46.560
...as you in turn were shown
by me many, many moons ago.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.800
I'm Veran's Arrow, the Guardian,

12:48.840 --> 12:50.240
mentor to the Chosen One.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.680
Really?

12:51.720 --> 12:53.440
And how did that go?

12:53.480 --> 12:55.560
It's Veran's will.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.480
Do the Veran's will, Veran's Arrow.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.840
Not a moment to lose.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.280
Qua...

13:32.760 --> 13:34.280
Morning, princess.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.040
That's close enough.

13:40.640 --> 13:44.040
How's the child?
Make it through the winter?

13:44.080 --> 13:46.400
It's tough out there in the cold,
especially for royalty.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.840
What do you want?

13:47.880 --> 13:50.400
Rome will meet with the Veran,
alone.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.400
Tell Rome to go fuck himself.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.800
Ah, princess.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.320
It's priceless.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.680
One minute she's sat
on her arse in a castle,

14:00.720 --> 14:02.640
two winters on, she knows
the mind of the Veran.

14:02.680 --> 14:05.640
Why should I trust you
when Veran doesn't?

14:05.680 --> 14:09.840
Because unlike you,
I actually know him.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.640
Think I'm stupid, witch?

14:14.680 --> 14:16.400
Easy, princess.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.640
You call me that once more.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.680
Where's the meeting?

14:29.880 --> 14:31.280
The first full moon,

14:33.840 --> 14:35.560
less than two days' time.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.000
Well, I can hardly wait.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.720
The witch spoke
of the Chosen One.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.200
What did she say?

14:47.240 --> 14:49.480
Rome would stop
at nothing to get her.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.000
But, if we give her up,
there would be peace.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.800
There is no peace
but through her.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.240
And Rome knows that.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.520
That's why he wants her
so badly.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.040
How did Rome know of her?

14:59.080 --> 15:00.960
Druids are not the only ones
with the prophecy.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.680
And what if it's a trap?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.760
Who says it isn't? Hya!

15:09.160 --> 15:10.600
I'll be back in three days.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.040
Aye, General.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.600
Make sure no one comes in
and out of the villa while I'm gone.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.520
You can manage that, can't you?
Of course.

15:16.560 --> 15:20.360
No, I'm serious. I want you to
keep an eye out. Come, let's go.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.120
Hya. Hya.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.360
Hya.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.040
That's amazing.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.560
Ten thousand years old
and you never look a day older.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.640
Oh, is that new?

16:03.680 --> 16:05.960
The, uh, scar?

16:06.800 --> 16:10.120
Now, don't get me wrong, I like
it, you know. Adds something.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.880
Makes you look rugged.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.680
Well...

16:15.720 --> 16:18.240
I don't wanna keep you,
so I'll get right down to it.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.880
It seems to me
I've got you over a barrel.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.480
And not just over a barrel,

16:23.520 --> 16:26.520
but, tied to it,
frock up, pants down.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.640
And I don't have to tell you,
a man of the world,

16:29.680 --> 16:31.120
what happens next.

16:32.280 --> 16:35.120
Fourteen moons ago,
I came to bargain.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.960
And you told me
the gods don't deal.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.000
And I thought to myself,
you know what,

16:42.040 --> 16:44.880
I'm gonna have to teach
that skinny cunt a lesson.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.640
So, with your Cantii queen,
your witch

16:48.680 --> 16:53.760
and your mysterious if
slightly irritating brother,

16:53.800 --> 16:57.240
I walked into your gods' house
and I blew it to kingdom come.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.600
And the best part is,

16:59.640 --> 17:01.440
I didn't even have to
get out of bed to do it.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.440
Listen, Hallam.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.680
Oh, do you mind
if I call you Hallam?

17:06.720 --> 17:08.240
From the western hills.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.640
Son of a shepherd.

17:11.680 --> 17:14.360
You know, when I found out
you weren't 10,000 years old,

17:14.400 --> 17:16.680
you could have knocked me over
with a feather.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.840
Just plain Hallam.

17:20.880 --> 17:23.640
Last in a long line of poor fools

17:23.680 --> 17:25.960
who call themselves the Veran.

17:31.280 --> 17:34.440
We both know why you're here, Rome.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.160
Forty moons
and you still haven't found her.

17:38.040 --> 17:40.160
How is that playing with your
master?

17:41.320 --> 17:43.840
How patient is he, Rome?

17:43.880 --> 17:46.000
I've come to make you an offer.

17:46.880 --> 17:49.200
What offer?

17:49.240 --> 17:50.840
Your time is over.

17:50.880 --> 17:54.120
I mean, you know it,
I know it, your gods know it.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.440
We know which way
the wind is blowing.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.320
It doesn't have to be like that.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.440
I can make it stop.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.480
What's the offer, Rome?

18:02.520 --> 18:04.320
A sanctuary.

18:04.360 --> 18:08.120
All the lands from the black
mountains to the southern plains.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.280
And Isca with it.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.480
Your lake of tears, all returned.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.440
Place where you and you guards
can thrive and prosper.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.200
Unbothered by us.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.680
Just like the old days.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.000
In exchange for what?

18:27.560 --> 18:28.960
The girl.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.200
Now, I know what you're thinking.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.760
What with your prophecy and all,
but things change.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.200
I know you can go back

18:39.240 --> 18:41.960
and square this
with the Druids and the tribes.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.200
Come on.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.640
I mean, we've helped
each other out before.

18:47.640 --> 18:50.880
When you chopped up that king for me,
huh?

18:50.920 --> 18:52.320
What's his name?

18:54.920 --> 18:58.880
You would not be here
if you were not afraid.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.680
The Chosen One was weak once,

19:01.720 --> 19:05.600
but with every moon,
she gets stronger.

19:05.640 --> 19:10.280
And your master
grows more and more restless.

19:10.320 --> 19:14.000
More angered by your failure.

19:14.800 --> 19:18.000
Do not presume
to know my master's mind.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.920
Oh, I know your master
better than you think.

19:23.160 --> 19:27.400
Have you never asked yourself
why I let you in to the Underworld?

19:28.560 --> 19:31.720
It's because you don't
enter the Underworld.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.840
The Underworld enters you.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.680
You know I never thought I'd say
this, but I miss your brother.

19:48.760 --> 19:51.640
You think you understand this game,
Rome?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.520
Think again!

20:28.600 --> 20:30.360
Morning.
Morning.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.880
Sorry, I don't know your name.

20:38.920 --> 20:42.840
Quant.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.560
Quant?
I think that's how you say it.

20:45.600 --> 20:48.280
Alright.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.440
Well, I'm, uh...
I'm here to, uh...

20:51.480 --> 20:53.800
I was chosen by Veran
to mentor the Chosen One

20:53.840 --> 20:55.640
and I'm going to be teaching
you some stuff.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.080
So, you're my mentor?

20:57.120 --> 21:00.120
No, no, no. Not your mentor.
More of a...

21:00.160 --> 21:01.720
A what?

21:01.760 --> 21:03.200
You know...

21:03.240 --> 21:04.640
I genuinely don't.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.880
Sorry, I'm not being clever,
I just don't have the first

21:06.920 --> 21:09.040
idea about being a Druid.
Let's jump in, shall we?

21:09.080 --> 21:10.840
I mean, I know
they killed both my parents.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.760
And stopped me being king.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.000
And were key players
in my sister's murder,

21:15.040 --> 21:17.840
but, apart from that,
they're a complete mystery.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.360
So, let's get started.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.320
See this?

21:26.840 --> 21:28.520
This is frog moss.
Yeah.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.200
This...

21:33.800 --> 21:35.720
Paper weed.
Paper weed.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.960
That patch over there...
thistle spear.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.400
Uh-huh.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.760
I want you to put this on,

21:41.800 --> 21:43.960
and go off and fill it with these.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.600
This moss, this weed,
and that blue herb.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.160
OK, thistle spears.

21:52.360 --> 21:53.760
Yeah, got it!

21:56.360 --> 21:57.960
Aw, it smells nice.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.760
It's poisonous.

22:01.800 --> 22:04.200
Swallow that,
you'll shit both lungs.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.600
So...

22:08.640 --> 22:10.760
..Frog moss, paper weed...

22:10.800 --> 22:12.200
thistle spear. Yeah.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.000
See you later.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.600
Under this oak, yeah?

22:19.920 --> 22:21.320
Beech?

22:25.040 --> 22:26.440
Sycamore?
Never.

22:27.640 --> 22:31.360
Not once did I imagine the price
of failure will be this high.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.560
Where's the General?

22:44.600 --> 22:46.000
Gone for a walk.

22:46.040 --> 22:47.440
Where?

22:47.480 --> 22:48.880
Didn't say.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.800
You don't like him, do you?

22:52.640 --> 22:54.960
No soldier likes his general.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.760
But you despise him.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.320
He killed your sister.

22:58.360 --> 23:00.240
Destroyed your home.

23:00.280 --> 23:03.320
Winter turns to spring,
you're still here.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.960
And you have a theory about that.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.920
Do.

23:06.960 --> 23:09.360
Either you're made of stone,
or you're planning something.

23:09.400 --> 23:12.880
Come on, take your pick.
I don't have to.

23:12.920 --> 23:15.520
But whatever it is,
he already knows about it.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.800
What about you?

23:19.840 --> 23:23.040
The Romans destroyed your home.

23:23.080 --> 23:25.000
Murdered your friends and family.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.480
And yet here you are...

23:28.000 --> 23:29.920
We're in the same boat, you and I.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.800
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.240
I saw you...

23:35.280 --> 23:37.280
let that man in here the other day.

23:37.320 --> 23:40.400
I saw him leave
with the General's sword.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.240
And what are you gonna do about it?

23:45.280 --> 23:47.680
Perhaps we can help each other.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.600
What's your plan?

23:59.640 --> 24:01.760
I'm gonna kill the General.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.880
And you're gonna help me.
His master is strong.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.040
If you mean Lokka,
I'm not afraid of him.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.360
Many gods, one god,
what's the difference?

24:08.400 --> 24:09.840
You walk a dangerous path.

24:09.880 --> 24:12.800
These marks on your face,

24:12.840 --> 24:14.240
which god did they honour?

24:14.280 --> 24:15.680
Do you even remember his name?

24:17.400 --> 24:19.080
I've seen so much blood.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.600
All caused by phantoms.

24:21.880 --> 24:24.040
You want to be free, Vitus,
really free?

24:25.320 --> 24:26.840
Then help me.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.600
How?

24:30.640 --> 24:32.560
What's the name of your god?

24:33.680 --> 24:35.920
The one who protects you,
the one who knew you as a child?

24:36.920 --> 24:38.320
I do not know him.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.360
Your new god can't
protect you now, you know that.

24:40.400 --> 24:41.800
What's his name?

24:41.840 --> 24:44.920
Her name is Sekhmet.
And what's your name?

24:48.520 --> 24:51.320
My name is

25:28.240 --> 25:29.640
Oh, no.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.840
Thistle spear.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.360
Frog moss.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.880
Hello. Hello, hello, hello.

26:18.360 --> 26:20.160
Boy, look at that.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.800
Look at that, look at that.

26:23.560 --> 26:26.360
Oh. Hello.

26:27.960 --> 26:29.480
Here's one.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.600
What if the Romans win, hmm?

26:32.600 --> 26:36.320
What if they wipe us out and there's
no one left to worship our gods?

26:36.360 --> 26:39.680
What do they do then?
They can't die. They're gods.

26:39.720 --> 26:42.160
So, do they just sit around,

26:42.200 --> 26:44.560
watching the Roman gods
get on with it?

26:47.720 --> 26:52.160
What happens when, one day, the
Roman gods die or get pushed aside,

26:52.200 --> 26:53.920
and there's
a whole bunch of new gods?

26:55.160 --> 26:56.720
Which begs the question,

26:56.760 --> 26:58.920
were there gods before our gods,

26:58.960 --> 27:00.760
who our gods pushed aside?

27:00.800 --> 27:03.840
Here's my point.
I'm worried that, somewhere,

27:03.880 --> 27:07.000
there are all these old gods,

27:07.880 --> 27:09.280
just sitting around,

27:09.320 --> 27:12.120
doing absolutely nothing.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.800
You don't worship anything.

27:15.840 --> 27:18.480
But you're here.

27:18.520 --> 27:20.680
Just like I am.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.080
What's gonna happen?

27:47.480 --> 27:49.520
When did they get here?
This morning.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.560
Let's drink.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.200
Eat.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.720
So, how was your journey?

28:27.760 --> 28:29.360
What's that?

28:30.360 --> 28:33.400
That? Oh, it commemorates
a recent victory.

28:33.440 --> 28:34.880
Victory?
Yes.

28:34.920 --> 28:37.960
The capture of a crucial
stronghold in the west.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.640
A crucial
stronghold in the west.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.400
Blaine.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.280
It's been a while.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.240
I have indeed
been here quite a while.

28:48.280 --> 28:50.840
But don't worry.
We've not forgotten you.

28:50.880 --> 28:52.960
Well, help yourself to wine.
Hmm.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.680
What happened to the finger?
Oh, erm...

28:55.720 --> 28:57.120
I shut it in a door.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.800
I want to be alone.

29:10.840 --> 29:12.240
With my husband.

29:13.760 --> 29:17.600
Come along.
Let's leave these two to catch up.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.840
You look well.
You look fat.

29:23.960 --> 29:27.640
The spoilt boy who spent the summer
drinking buttermilk.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.080
Yes, well, I've missed you too.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.520
Lokka is angry.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.800
You were sent to do his will...

29:33.840 --> 29:35.240
And you failed.

29:35.280 --> 29:37.400
Well, first of all, my darling,
who says I've failed?

29:37.440 --> 29:38.880
Then where is she?

29:38.920 --> 29:40.320
It's not that simple.

29:40.360 --> 29:42.160
You were sent here for one reason.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.680
Now everything we have worked for,

29:43.720 --> 29:46.040
everything we've achieved
is about to be destroyed.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.240
Do you know what
he'll do to you? To us?

29:50.280 --> 29:52.360
So, is that why you're here?
To give me a telling off?

29:52.400 --> 29:54.000
It's not my wrath you should fear.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.920
I came here to do
his will and I'm doing it.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.560
These Druids are not like
the others we've faced.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.440
And their powers run deep.
Their gods are old.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.920
They're in the soil,
the rivers, the blood.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.640
So?
So, it takes time.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.040
We don't have time.

30:12.280 --> 30:14.680
Perhaps Lokka still loves you.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.800
But for how long?

30:16.840 --> 30:18.240
You let me worry about that.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.080
Don't forget who it was...

30:25.600 --> 30:27.960
chose you to serve him.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.960
How could I?

30:37.640 --> 30:40.240
What are you doing?

30:40.280 --> 30:42.000
Hey. Having supper.

30:43.320 --> 30:45.280
Where are they?
Where's what?

30:45.320 --> 30:46.840
The frog moss. The paper weed!

30:46.880 --> 30:48.280
The thistle spear!

30:48.320 --> 30:50.200
I couldn't find any.
What do you mean?

30:50.240 --> 30:52.400
The whole forest
is stiff with the fuckers!

30:52.440 --> 30:54.080
Yeah, but I couldn't find any.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.560
Found something else, though, look.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.680
Two days ago,
I met with the Druid.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.360
Now, he's a stubborn one,

31:21.160 --> 31:22.960
but I know
he's about to cooperate.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.200
Oh. Why is that?

31:25.240 --> 31:26.640
I've hit him where it hurts.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.640
Ooh.
Place called Isca.

31:28.680 --> 31:31.440
It's their most sacred spot
and I've captured it.

31:31.480 --> 31:34.920
You said yourself, their gods
are in the soil, the rivers,

31:34.960 --> 31:38.360
so, how can capturing
one stronghold hurt them?

31:38.400 --> 31:40.920
Well, like most things, dear,
you're missing the fine detail.

31:40.960 --> 31:43.760
Fuck the fine detail.
Lokka wants results.

31:45.680 --> 31:49.360
I chose you because you're fast,

31:49.400 --> 31:50.800
strong.

31:51.840 --> 31:54.400
Are you still strong,

31:54.440 --> 31:56.800
or just a fat puppy?

31:56.840 --> 31:58.240
Well, you try me.

32:37.440 --> 32:38.840
Well, well,

32:40.080 --> 32:41.480
what have we here?

32:54.120 --> 32:56.320
What's your name?

32:58.880 --> 33:00.560
I'm Praefectus Vitus Validus.

33:04.440 --> 33:07.240
I had a dream about a man like you.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.200
He turned into a snake.

33:14.400 --> 33:16.920
Do not touch me again.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.400
She's a queen of lands west of here,

33:25.440 --> 33:27.000
and she's been a valuable asset.

33:27.040 --> 33:30.280
She knows magic.
Oh, she thinks she does.

33:30.320 --> 33:32.360
Is she a good fuck?

33:33.200 --> 33:35.080
You know, my love,
if I didn't know you better,

33:35.120 --> 33:36.720
I'd say you were a tad jealous.

33:36.760 --> 33:38.560
I've seen you fuck a dog, Aulis.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.000
What is...

33:44.080 --> 33:45.480
this?

33:45.520 --> 33:47.240
Oh, that, it's, erm...

33:47.280 --> 33:50.040
It's a sword. One of the children
were playing with it outside.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.480
Ooh.

33:51.520 --> 33:54.200
Doesn't look like a sword.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.880
What else could it possibly be?

33:56.680 --> 34:00.440
By the way, where is your bumcha?

34:00.480 --> 34:01.880
The Praefectus?

34:01.920 --> 34:03.880
Lucius? He's gone.

34:03.920 --> 34:05.320
Gone?
Yes.

34:05.360 --> 34:07.960
He was injured in the landing
so we shipped him home.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.920
And miss all the fun?

34:11.480 --> 34:13.080
Where's your sword?

34:16.440 --> 34:17.840
It's, erm...

34:17.880 --> 34:19.920
..out.

34:21.200 --> 34:22.600
Getting polished.

34:22.640 --> 34:24.440
Polished?

34:24.480 --> 34:26.360
Yes. And engraved.

34:39.120 --> 34:42.640
We found this...

34:42.680 --> 34:44.160
stuck in a stump.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.800
Recognize it?
It's a sword.

34:50.320 --> 34:51.920
Has your name on it.

34:53.640 --> 34:56.880
Oh, yes, and they've spelt it right.
That's nice, isn't it?

34:56.920 --> 34:59.880
It's lovely and shiny.
You can see your face in it.

35:02.680 --> 35:04.720
Send for her.

35:27.320 --> 35:30.280
It's been some time since
I looked into these eyes.

35:32.320 --> 35:34.040
These eyes look older.

35:35.280 --> 35:38.560
The things they've seen
have changed them.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.640
Just as the things ahead
will change them further.

35:43.280 --> 35:46.600
When I look into your eyes,
I can see everything.

35:46.640 --> 35:48.080
Your fear.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.440
Your terror.

35:51.520 --> 35:52.920
Your weakness.

35:54.040 --> 35:55.960
I also see some wisdom.

35:57.080 --> 35:58.840
But you're not yet wise.

36:00.040 --> 36:01.880
There's much still to learn.

36:04.160 --> 36:06.480
Your name's Hallum.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.400
You were born in the Western Hills.

36:09.520 --> 36:12.320
You were taken from
your home by the Druids.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.160
You were too young to know
what was going on.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.280
Before you knew it,
you'd forgotten who Hallum was

36:16.320 --> 36:17.720
and you were lost.

36:19.120 --> 36:20.640
And they shaped you.

36:20.680 --> 36:23.160
Trained and forced you
to turn into something else,

36:23.200 --> 36:24.640
something that you never were.

36:26.080 --> 36:28.000
They told you it was meant to be.

36:30.400 --> 36:32.480
And you felt like
you didn't have a choice.

36:32.520 --> 36:33.960
It was written.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.440
But you knew you were lost.

36:39.400 --> 36:42.560
And you knew you would stay lost
until you found a way out.

36:43.880 --> 36:45.440
'Cause you didn't choose this.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.080
You didn't choose any of this.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.520
Ah, Hemple.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.720
This is Queen Amena of the Cantii.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.240
Queen Amena, this is Hemple...

37:15.160 --> 37:16.560
My wife.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.440
I'm honoured to meet you.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.040
So, tell me.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.840
How do you like my husband's cock?

37:26.040 --> 37:27.960
Oh, don't worry, my dear.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.800
When a soldier is far from home,

37:30.840 --> 37:33.000
for years, in this case,

37:33.040 --> 37:36.280
he is wont to take a whore
to end his lusting.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.520
To release tension.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.960
Keeps him focused.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.960
Makes a change from
wanking into a sock.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.400
Isn't that right, darling?

37:46.640 --> 37:48.080
My husband says he trusts you.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.080
Is he right to?

37:51.120 --> 37:53.720
Before you answer,
you must know that

37:53.760 --> 37:55.560
my reason for being here

37:55.600 --> 37:59.680
is not to catch up with
old hubby here. No, no, no, no, no.

37:59.720 --> 38:04.960
I'm here on very,
very important business.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
So, what we need to know,

38:09.040 --> 38:11.400
when it really comes down to it,

38:11.440 --> 38:12.840
is who is a friend

38:14.840 --> 38:16.280
and who is a snake?

38:34.560 --> 38:36.160
"I've seen so much blood.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.240
"All caused by phantoms.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.320
"You want be free, Vitus,
really free?

38:44.600 --> 38:46.200
"Then help me."

38:51.400 --> 38:56.480
Tonight, my fellow travellers
and I will hold a feast.

38:56.520 --> 38:59.840
To celebrate this wonderous
reunion with our fated General.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.360
Come.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.040
You say you came here
to find the truth.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.240
I think there's another reason.

39:15.280 --> 39:19.320
Tell me, child,
why did you really come here?

39:19.360 --> 39:21.160
These past months, I've seen things,

39:21.200 --> 39:23.920
done things
I never thought I would.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.120
Many times I've been lost.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.600
Afraid.

39:28.400 --> 39:32.280
But the thing I was
most afraid of, it wasn't fire,

39:32.320 --> 39:34.320
or water, or even death.

39:35.400 --> 39:36.800
It was love.

39:38.800 --> 39:41.680
When I found it,
that's when I truly changed.

39:41.720 --> 39:44.560
Because, for the first time,
I felt like me.

39:46.200 --> 39:48.240
Before the sun set, it was gone.

39:50.400 --> 39:51.800
And I miss it.

39:53.240 --> 39:55.160
I miss being me. I just...

39:56.160 --> 39:57.720
want to be me.

40:00.520 --> 40:02.120
So, that's her, eh?

40:04.120 --> 40:05.520
That's her.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.280
She didn't look
that pleased to see you.

40:08.360 --> 40:10.320
What's your point?
Hey, look,

40:10.360 --> 40:12.320
I know that
she's been through a lot.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.160
A significant amount of it
is your fault.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.600
Yeah.

40:15.640 --> 40:19.040
When I killed that boy,
I was absolutely convinced

40:19.080 --> 40:20.920
that I was doing the right thing.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.320
And then I discovered I was wrong.

40:24.360 --> 40:27.320
But, and here is the part...
I thought she was annoying...

40:27.360 --> 40:29.360
..if I hadn't...
..she wouldn't be here now.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.800
..Exactly. Exactly. She'd be lost.

40:33.240 --> 40:34.960
But she came back.
Congratulations.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.080
Hey. Don't thank me.

40:38.120 --> 40:41.640
Man who did that was called Phelan.
Good.

40:41.680 --> 40:43.720
Or Rolf.
Listen...

40:43.760 --> 40:46.320
Quant, if it's all the same
with you,

40:46.360 --> 40:47.840
I'll get through this next bit

40:47.880 --> 40:49.480
without your profound insights.

40:49.520 --> 40:50.920
I mean, I've got this.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.680
I know what's going on.

40:52.720 --> 40:54.120
Suit yourself.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.800
Evening, Abdul.

41:43.360 --> 41:45.040
Oh!

42:00.840 --> 42:02.720
Have you never wanted to escape?

42:04.680 --> 42:06.080
Escape to where?

42:07.920 --> 42:09.400
What is my name?

42:18.920 --> 42:20.800
It's written... here.

42:20.840 --> 42:23.720
Tell me my name or I cannot go on.

42:23.760 --> 42:25.840
You're not ready to know.

42:25.880 --> 42:27.280
Tell me...

42:29.120 --> 42:30.520
If I'm to trust you.

42:39.240 --> 42:42.960
Aulus Plautius.

42:45.280 --> 42:46.680
Marriage...

42:48.040 --> 42:50.680
is a long, hard journey.

42:52.920 --> 42:56.120
And sometimes, we lose the path.

42:58.680 --> 43:00.080
Weakness beckons.

43:01.080 --> 43:02.880
Veils are drawn.

43:03.920 --> 43:09.760
And, so, this day,
we will renew the vows we made.

43:09.800 --> 43:13.000
And the sacrament we shared
that day.

43:14.480 --> 43:19.720
As we shed ourselves of the veils,

43:19.760 --> 43:21.280
the fears,

43:22.080 --> 43:23.760
the weaknesses.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.360
Your name...

43:27.400 --> 43:28.880
Let us feast.

43:53.640 --> 43:57.880
Your name is...

43:57.920 --> 44:00.480
Fuck the gods.

44:16.360 --> 44:17.760
My name is Cait.

44:38.480 --> 44:39.960
Shall I be Mother?

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
