00:04.271 --> 00:06.939
Okay, move it.
Move it, move it.

00:06.941 --> 00:10.175
This is not a drill.
Special assembly!
Special assembly!

00:13.614 --> 00:16.281
Diggy and i broke up, um,
because he decided

00:16.283 --> 00:18.350
To be a foreign
exchange student...
(sad chuckle)

00:18.352 --> 00:19.935
Again.

00:19.936 --> 00:21.519
Uh, since then we haven't
really seen each other much,

00:21.522 --> 00:23.355
But, i mean, we're still
great friends.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.225
Conversation just kinda
flows like it used to.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.626
(chuckles)

00:27.628 --> 00:29.762
-Uh...
-(clicks tongue)

00:32.800 --> 00:35.934
-Great chat. Such a good chat.
-Yeah, totally. Great.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.770
-Go, porcu-- pines.
-Pork--

00:38.706 --> 00:40.572
Karen:
All right, let's go, people!

00:40.574 --> 00:42.908
One, two, three,
eyes on me.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.811
Four, five, six,
shut your faces!

00:48.582 --> 00:49.948
-(clears throat)
-last weekend,

00:49.950 --> 00:52.818
I had a run-in
with a wild porcupine.

00:52.820 --> 00:56.355
Because of that,
i will not be sitting down
any time soon.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.257
-(chuckles, snorts)
-(giggles)

01:00.327 --> 01:02.027
They're really cute,
but they're killers.

01:02.029 --> 01:04.296
Yeah, that's why
the porcupine's our mascot.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.864
<i>Was  </i> your mascot.

01:06.967 --> 01:11.236
We have a new one,
which honors our proud
wisconsin heritage.

01:11.238 --> 01:15.441
I introduce
the ridgewood butter!

01:15.443 --> 01:17.276

01:17.978 --> 01:19.611
-(mouths)
-maddie:  <i> What?!</i>

01:19.613 --> 01:20.913
-Mm-hmm.
-The butter?

01:20.915 --> 01:23.615
That's so dumb.
We're the porcupines.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.918
Yeah, you can't
just take paulie.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.687
-He's part of our family.
-This is a travesty.

01:28.689 --> 01:31.356
I just finished hand-knitting
my paulie sweater.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.429
The angry human,
leprechaun-dude is right.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.331
Butter's no kind of mascot.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.634
A decision's been made
and the porcupine is out!

01:42.636 --> 01:45.304
Meet bobby butter stick!

01:45.306 --> 01:47.005
Whoo! Hey!

-Whoo! (laughs)

01:53.481 --> 01:57.716
Oh, come on, people.
Where's your school spirit?

01:57.718 --> 02:00.018
Turn those boos

a rain shower

Our family went
on a ski trip last winter

05:18.519 --> 05:21.219
And mom made us all
matching beanies.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.658
It was definitely a rooney.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.859
A rooney did this!

05:27.861 --> 05:29.561
Not me, though.

The ridgewood butter

We want perfect!

11:51.211 --> 11:52.343
Swiss chocolate!

11:52.345 --> 11:53.945
It opens the esophagus

11:53.947 --> 11:55.480

the proper amount of phlegm.

12:21.641 --> 12:24.109
I think
we just about fixed it.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.578
Where'd you get
all the chair material from?

12:26.580 --> 12:29.147
Oh, it's my newest invention,
"parker patches,"

12:29.149 --> 12:31.282
Made from old underwear
and banana peels.

12:32.586 --> 12:36.187
Now, just a little more
parker paste over here.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.656
And we're done.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.226
Ah, nice work, dr. P.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.295
Ahh, my tush
is feeling this cush.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.968
And now my tush
is feeling stuck.

12:51.705 --> 12:53.171
I can't get--

12:58.311 --> 13:00.111
-Up close and personal.
-Mm-hmm.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.616
(sniffs)
did you start
wearing cologne?

13:06.219 --> 13:08.219
The ladies enjoy it.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.995
Joey:
Ooh, there's diggy.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.963
Now, if you want to play
in the state tournament tonight,

13:18.965 --> 13:20.398
You have to interrogate him.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.268
What? No.
Joey, diggy didn't do it.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.670
Oh, i get it.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.572
You're scared to talk
to your ex-boo.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.974
(laughs)
don't worry, babe.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.543
Bobby butter stick's
got your back.

13:31.545 --> 13:33.645
Why? What?
No, what are you doing?

13:33.647 --> 13:35.580
-(grunts)
-no!

13:39.586 --> 13:43.188
Diggy, my man, what's up?
Anything new?

13:43.190 --> 13:46.391
Oh, and where were you
last night when someone
vandalized the butter?!

13:48.261 --> 13:49.627
Ow.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.198
I was playing
basketball in the park.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.201
Oh, okay, were you
with anybody else?

13:56.203 --> 13:58.236
No, i was by myself.

13:58.238 --> 14:01.339
(chuckles)
so no one was there
to vouch for you.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.374
Dun, dun, duh!

14:06.079 --> 14:08.646
He did it.
He's got a tell.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.449
When he's lying,
his eyes get extra smoldery.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.184
-Ugh!
-Yeah, come on.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.153
Let's go tell kneebauer
and get you cleared to play.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.221
No, we're not doing that!

14:17.190 --> 14:18.256
I know that
diggy didn't do it.

14:20.227 --> 14:23.027
(exhales)
so last night
i went out on my run.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.797
And i happened to see
that he was shooting hoops
in the park

14:25.799 --> 14:27.665
So i just decided
to hide behind a tree

14:27.667 --> 14:29.767
And watch him
for a couple minutes.

14:29.769 --> 14:32.537
Well, that is super weird.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.341
But still, i mean,
he could have done it
after you left.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.243
Yeah...

14:38.245 --> 14:41.246
A couple minutes
turned into, like,
a couple hours.

14:42.282 --> 14:46.217
Oh, you want to
get back together.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.152
No! I don't!

14:48.154 --> 14:49.721
And besides,
it's not gonna happen.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.190
I mean,
he's going to australia.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.325
All right, all right,
whatever you say.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.527
Winkety, wink, wink, wink.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.232
Come on, let's go
tell everyone your alibi.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.068
You were watching diggy
from behind a tree for hours.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.571
No!
Joey, we're not doing that!

15:06.573 --> 15:08.506
We're not
gonna tell anyone that
'cause it's not an alibi

15:08.508 --> 15:09.774
'cause nobody saw me.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.743
Hey, maddie.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.311
I saw you hiding
behind a tree in the park

15:13.313 --> 15:14.812
For hours last night.

15:14.814 --> 15:18.149
Boom! Alibi!

15:18.151 --> 15:20.451
No, i don't want diggy
to know i was there.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.253
We just have to find a clue

15:22.255 --> 15:23.655
So we can figure out
who framed me.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.224
Yeah, you've got
to find your perp.

15:26.226 --> 15:27.558
(gasps)
wait!

15:27.560 --> 15:29.193
"perp" is the beginning
of "purple,"

15:29.195 --> 15:30.728
Which is the color
of our uniforms!

15:30.730 --> 15:32.664
Is that a clue?!

15:32.666 --> 15:34.699
No. Lacey,
that is not a clue.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.301
I'm not even sure
it's a thought.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.670
What about the smudges
on that beanie?

15:38.672 --> 15:41.239
-Is that a clue?
-No, lacey, that's not a clue.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.241
Oh, wait, yes!
That is so a clue!

15:44.711 --> 15:47.278
What is that? Is that--
is that paint or blood?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.314
-I-- i can't tell.
-Whoever planted that beanie

15:49.316 --> 15:51.115
Must have had that
gunk on their hands.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.417
You figure out
what those smudges are

15:52.419 --> 15:54.218
And you figure out
who did this.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.821
(sighs)
i think this is a job
for dr. P.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.289
Oh.

15:59.859 --> 16:02.427
Superintendent kneebauer's
bumper.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.496
Does this meet
your high standards,
you vandal-snob?

16:13.206 --> 16:14.556
Parker, i need your help!

16:14.557 --> 16:15.907
Can you help me figure out
what these smudges are?

16:15.909 --> 16:17.442
Thanks.

16:21.815 --> 16:25.850
Aren't you at least
gonna ask how we got
stuck to this chair?

16:25.852 --> 16:29.187
Uh, you built a cloud

16:29.189 --> 16:31.689
That shot a lightening bolt
into mom's brand-new chair,

16:31.691 --> 16:33.291
Which you then fixed
with parker paste,

16:33.293 --> 16:34.892
Which has now bonded your butts
to the cushion and...

16:34.894 --> 16:37.328
(inhales deeply)
reggie started wearing cologne.

16:43.536 --> 16:44.669
Both: Whoa.

16:44.670 --> 16:45.803
All right, now,
please help me figure out
what those smudges are

16:45.805 --> 16:47.238
Before my game tips off.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.675
To the laboratory!

16:53.380 --> 16:56.280
You know,
i am not loving
that cologne.

16:56.282 --> 16:57.882
It isn't for you.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.456

17:57.844 --> 17:59.427

<i>Everyone, stop!</i>

18:29.809 --> 18:31.909
After extensive testing,

18:31.911 --> 18:36.314
We determined
that the smudges are chocolate
of a swiss origin.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.449
I figured it out
because i licked it.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.353

need to tell me, rooney?

18:44.023 --> 18:46.324
