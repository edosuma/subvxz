00:18.652 --> 00:20.787
 Okay, Thornhill knows
how to throw a ball.

00:20.905 --> 00:22.488
Pierce may be
 a sitting fuck, but...

00:22.540 --> 00:24.991
the main targets here
are Maddox and Chung.

00:25.042 --> 00:26.793
Well, hit Chung
with inexperience

00:26.827 --> 00:28.328
and Maddox
with resignation--

00:28.379 --> 00:29.879
actual and general air of.

00:29.914 --> 00:32.215
Yeah, I want
their heads on my wall.

00:32.249 --> 00:34.918
- Actual heads.
- God, I love this kind of talk.

00:34.920 --> 00:38.838
Gets me aroused.
Sorry, I meant roused.

00:38.889 --> 00:41.474
No, did I-- I meant aroused.
Aroused.

00:41.508 --> 00:43.176
- Hi, Catherine.
- Hi.

00:43.227 --> 00:45.094
- Americano, dash of cow.
- Thanks.

00:45.096 --> 00:48.231
Whoa, who the fuck
is smiley-faced coffee boy?

00:48.265 --> 00:50.233
That's Jackson. I hired him to
sharpen up Selina's answers.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.902
- He's a writer.
- Yeah, you know, speeches, one-liners.

00:52.937 --> 00:54.687
Just me and my iPad,

00:54.738 --> 00:56.773
which I like to call
the "Zinger Sewing Machine."

00:56.775 --> 01:00.026
Oh. So you threw away Dan and
you kept the voodoo doll, huh?

01:00.077 --> 01:02.779
No, it's terrible that the First
Lady tried to kill herself,

01:02.781 --> 01:04.614
but our carrying on is what
she would have wanted--

01:04.616 --> 01:07.367
-  does want.
-  Okay, let's rehearse the debate.

01:07.418 --> 01:09.538
Congressman Furlong,
can you be Joe Thornhill?

01:09.587 --> 01:11.254
Let's see. "I don't know
anything about NAFTA,

01:11.288 --> 01:13.206
but I do know about baseball.

01:13.257 --> 01:14.757
Baseball, baseball, baseball.

01:14.792 --> 01:17.210
Look at my muscly chest.
Vote for me."

01:17.261 --> 01:20.129
- Ben, you are Owen Pierce.
- "Well, I'm a baby-faced,

01:20.131 --> 01:22.715
know-nothing congressman
from 'Shit Stain, ' Nevada,

01:22.766 --> 01:25.385
who's got the newly dropped
balls enough

01:25.436 --> 01:27.887
to think that...
I can run for president."

01:27.938 --> 01:30.189
Kent, you are
former Sec Def Maddox.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.691
Don't do the voice, though.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.943
I've only ever used  this voice,

01:33.978 --> 01:35.778
- even as a young child.
- Okay.

01:35.813 --> 01:37.947
Sec Def Maddox, where
do you stand on crime?

01:37.982 --> 01:40.400
Well, right now I'm coming
across pretty hard-lined,

01:40.451 --> 01:44.621
so I'll go soft
to outflank Mr. Chung.

01:44.655 --> 01:47.073
Oh, well, I'm the hip-hop
governor of Minnesota

01:47.124 --> 01:48.741
and I'm coming off as too soft,

01:48.792 --> 01:51.377
so I'll try to out-hard
Sec Def Maddox.

01:51.412 --> 01:54.998
They've got more flip-flops
than the cast of "Baywatch."

01:55.049 --> 01:58.301
- What? Oh, my God. - Well, maybe-- I don't
know if it's gonna be "Baywatch."

01:58.335 --> 02:00.553
There's probably a more
up-to-date reference we could--

02:00.587 --> 02:02.338
You know what, son?
You should only talk

02:02.340 --> 02:03.506
if someone pulls
your string, okay?

02:03.557 --> 02:05.558
And even then, you
just say, "Tickle me."

02:05.592 --> 02:09.345
I like his jokes.
They're jokes, right?

02:09.395 --> 02:10.847
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

02:10.848 --> 02:13.399
Okay, everyone, a drumroll.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.851
That's not really a drumroll.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.520
- She's coming. She's coming.
-  Ready?

02:17.571 --> 02:19.355
I think Gary's about to come.

02:19.357 --> 02:21.157
-  Don't do it.
- It's too much buildup.

02:21.191 --> 02:23.359
It's too much buildup.

02:23.361 --> 02:26.162
Rebranded.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.948
What do we think?
I love it.

02:28.999 --> 02:33.086
Love it-- love it.
Looks great.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.537
I never knew you had
so much neck.

02:34.539 --> 02:36.673
- I know!
- I mean that in a good way.

02:36.707 --> 02:38.424
-  Right.
- I think necks are neat.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.209
I'm going to go show
everybody myself.

02:40.211 --> 02:41.794
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go do it.

02:41.845 --> 02:44.263
Just imagine, that's what you'll
look like when you become a boy.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.349
Ma'am, this is the haircut that
your head has always wanted,

02:46.383 --> 02:48.301
- but was too afraid to ask for.
- Right.

02:48.352 --> 02:50.019
- Everything about it says...
- "Tomorrow."

02:50.054 --> 02:51.270
- ...tomorrow.
- Yeah.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.056
Hello. Oh, no,
don't be shy.

02:53.107 --> 02:55.975
If you feel like you must
applaud, then, you know.

02:56.026 --> 02:58.444
Oh...

02:59.697 --> 03:01.114
No, it's fine.
Don't, don't.

03:01.148 --> 03:02.732
Look at that, Mom.

03:02.783 --> 03:05.234
People are gonna start to think
we're sisters now or-- or siblings.

03:05.236 --> 03:06.536
Well, that's not the haircut.

03:06.570 --> 03:07.904
That's always been the case.
We always get that.

03:07.906 --> 03:09.386
- Hi.
- Ma'am.

03:09.406 --> 03:11.074
- Yes? 
- Can you sign this to the max, please?

03:11.125 --> 03:12.408
Yes.

03:15.462 --> 03:16.913
Getting nothing here.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.548
- Thank you.
- Okay.

03:18.582 --> 03:19.916
"Short hair
for the long haul."

03:19.918 --> 03:21.884
- That's good, I like that.
- Thanks, guys.

03:21.919 --> 03:23.419
- Very good. 
- What is it with you two?

03:23.421 --> 03:26.556
It's like-- it's like
flirting, but sexless.

03:26.590 --> 03:29.225
-  Well, look, it's "George Looney."
- Hey, Kent.

03:29.259 --> 03:30.810
Dan, what are you doing here?

03:30.844 --> 03:33.096
Everybody needs
to be somewhere, Mike.

03:33.098 --> 03:36.482
- I need to be here. 
- So, did they cure you or whatever?

03:36.517 --> 03:38.601
No, I did not need
to be cured, Michael.

03:38.603 --> 03:40.770
I diagnosed myself
with an acute case

03:40.854 --> 03:43.272
of "everything's fine."

03:43.274 --> 03:44.857
Can I get anybody a coffee?

03:44.908 --> 03:46.275
- Uh, yes, please.
- Yeah? Okay.

03:46.326 --> 03:47.994
Milk and two heaping spoonfuls

03:48.028 --> 03:50.663
- of whatever the fuck you're on.
- Me, too.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.281
'Cause it frames
my face. Yeah.

03:52.283 --> 03:53.750
Oh, excuse me, buddy.

03:53.784 --> 03:56.119
- Oh! 
- Oh. I didn't even recognize you.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.620
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

03:57.622 --> 03:59.505
- I love it. Do you love it?
- Yeah.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.458
Uh, ma'am, I just wanna say again...
thank you.

04:02.460 --> 04:04.794
- Mm-hmm. 
- And I'm still very sorry that I-- you know,

04:04.796 --> 04:06.796
I let it all get to me.
But I've cleared it out.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.464
I'm much more centered.
I'm better.

04:08.466 --> 04:10.633
Yeah, well, like I said
before, I forgive you.

04:10.635 --> 04:12.051
- Because I'm nice...
- You are.

04:12.102 --> 04:13.936
- and because I need your brain.
- Thank you.

04:13.971 --> 04:16.856
But don't ever go
schizo-titzo on me again.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.930
And get rid of this.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.063
- Ma'am, continuing to love the hair.
- Thank you.

04:24.114 --> 04:25.794
- Welcome to debate prep.
- Oh, good.

04:25.816 --> 04:27.233
- Mike is Chung.
 Uh-huh.

04:27.284 --> 04:29.152
- Kent is ex-Sec Def Maddox.
- Ooh.

04:29.203 --> 04:31.737
- Ben is Owen Pierce.
- Oh, that does look like him.

04:31.789 --> 04:33.790
And Congressman Furlong
is Joe Thornhill.

04:33.824 --> 04:36.325
- Baseball.
- Yeah. Oh, God.

04:36.327 --> 04:39.412
Can't we give Pierce a dollar, send
him off to the movies or something?

04:39.463 --> 04:41.464
Let me tell you something.
Thornhill's the one to watch,

04:41.498 --> 04:44.417
because he is
a complete asshole.

04:44.468 --> 04:47.336
Actually, you know what?
Here you go, buddy.

04:47.421 --> 04:50.389
- Thank you.
- Coffee for the Golden Bear.

04:50.424 --> 04:54.010
I have a buddy who is inside
MLB and he said it's possible

04:54.061 --> 04:56.345
that Thornhill
might have had an affair.

04:56.396 --> 04:57.980
Ooh.
Do we have proof?

04:58.015 --> 04:59.599
Yeah, is there a smoking condom?

04:59.650 --> 05:01.484
It supposedly happened
about eight years ago.

05:01.518 --> 05:03.903
Eight years ago? It could have been anyone.
Could have been Ben.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.905
- Yeah, I poked everything that
moved back then. -  You did.

05:05.939 --> 05:09.025
All right, well, we just need
another reliable source and then...

05:09.076 --> 05:10.860
we can make it
an affair to remember.

05:10.862 --> 05:12.695
Bam!

05:12.697 --> 05:14.697
God, I feel so powerful!

05:14.748 --> 05:18.334
I got a whole new rush
of blood to my new head.

05:18.368 --> 05:20.369
Well, if Thornhill strayed
once, there might be others.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.205
Maybe a crack whore,
if we're lucky.

05:22.256 --> 05:24.373
Call me naive, but
isn't that unethical?

05:24.375 --> 05:26.542
You're naive.
Welcome to politics.

05:26.593 --> 05:29.212
Sorry to interrupt, but I
need these looked at, stat.

05:29.214 --> 05:31.214
And the president's
office is on the line.

05:31.216 --> 05:34.517
Oh, my God. The president
will not stop calling.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.602
I just can't seem to get
him out of my hair.

05:36.637 --> 05:39.055
- Ma'am?
- Did you notice?

05:39.106 --> 05:40.940
- You have a new haircut.
- Yeah.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.358
- And a twitch.
- What?

05:42.392 --> 05:44.777
I thought I was just feeling it.
You actually saw it?

05:44.811 --> 05:46.896
- It's really, really, really tiny.
-  You've seen it?

05:46.947 --> 05:48.898
When you feel it happening,
maybe you smile through it.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.317
- Oh.
- Oh, there. Aha!

05:51.368 --> 05:53.202
- Did you see that?
- Not at all.

05:53.237 --> 05:55.071
Sue, I cannot
stress to you enough

05:55.122 --> 05:58.374
the uninterruptability
of this meeting.

05:58.408 --> 06:00.493
Well, maybe I should get my
mother to sign these papers.

06:00.544 --> 06:03.329
Sue, do not test me. I do not
want to have a scene here.

06:03.380 --> 06:05.631
I will not have a scene.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.500
Somebody should check if
they're having makeup sex.

06:07.551 --> 06:11.254
- Gary. Gary! 
- What do you think of the new cut, huh?

06:11.305 --> 06:13.673
- Do you like it? 
- Of course I don't fucking like it, Gary.

06:13.757 --> 06:16.592
It's the worst use of scissors
since my failed vasectomy.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.978
The elfin look is in right now.
I was reading about it.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.429
People don't elect elves, okay?

06:20.480 --> 06:21.931
They put them to work in grottos

06:21.982 --> 06:23.766
or they get them drunk at frat
parties so they can toss them.

06:23.768 --> 06:26.102
- Okay, that's dwarfs.
- It doesn't matter.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.187
Do you really think
it's too short?

06:28.238 --> 06:30.022
Yeah.
She looks like k.d. lang.

06:30.073 --> 06:32.191
Think of all the lesbian jokes
we're gonna have to suffer.

06:32.242 --> 06:34.777
"Strap-on Selina,"
"Selina Navratilova,"

06:34.828 --> 06:37.830
- "fingering the dyke."
- Oh, Mike. Why are you so angry?

06:37.864 --> 06:41.033
Because you have created a
fuckload of work for me.

06:41.084 --> 06:43.119
I have to go out and find a
friendly style reporter,

06:43.121 --> 06:46.088
get 'em on our side--
preferably a blind one.

06:46.123 --> 06:48.374
- You're married to one.
- A blind woman?

06:48.425 --> 06:51.961
- Okay. 
- Oh, Wendy. I'll text her.

06:51.963 --> 06:54.297
Okay, do you think we could
add extensions or something?

06:54.299 --> 06:57.099
I'm up for extensions.
What are extensions?

06:58.385 --> 07:00.136
The first thing
is defense spending.

07:00.138 --> 07:01.520
Yeah, well, then we use
the drawdown-lockdown.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.806
- Right.
- Fuck-what which-way?

07:03.808 --> 07:06.275
Draw down troops abroad,
lock down the budget at home.

07:06.310 --> 07:09.278
Our line can be "Thornhill's
hitting home runs and away runs."

07:09.313 --> 07:10.813
- Can you have "away runs"?
- Yeah.

07:10.864 --> 07:14.817
- No. - Okay, so what am
I attacking Chung with?

07:14.819 --> 07:17.153
- HA-HA. - What, are you laughing
at us, "Pee-wee Sperman"?

07:17.155 --> 07:19.455
- Oh, stop it.
- HA-HA...

07:19.489 --> 07:22.291
"Health care, air pollution,
high salaries, and Afghanistan."

07:22.326 --> 07:24.076
 Position on immigration.

07:24.127 --> 07:25.745
Okay, well, my position

07:25.796 --> 07:27.330
has always been clear
on immigration.

07:27.381 --> 07:30.800
Um... oh, God, what the
fuck is that thing?

07:30.834 --> 07:33.169
- The three Rs.
- Oh, the three Rs.

07:33.220 --> 07:36.922
"Reaffirm,
reform, renew."

07:36.974 --> 07:38.174
- Renew.
- Yes.

07:38.176 --> 07:40.643
I don't think I like
the three Rs, you guys.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.595
- I like them.
- You do?

07:42.646 --> 07:45.181
Okay, yeah. I like them, then.
I like 'em.

07:45.232 --> 07:48.517
Okay, so, moving on. Do you
think that your London trip

07:48.519 --> 07:50.236
harmed the "special
relationship"?

07:50.270 --> 07:53.072
Absolutely not. We still have
a very special relationship

07:53.106 --> 07:55.241
and I'm very much
looking forward

07:55.275 --> 07:57.693
to the upcoming royal visit.

07:58.829 --> 07:59.945
 Okay.

07:59.997 --> 08:01.747
I think we're gonna
leave it there today.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.033
Meeting is over.
Pleasantries, et cetera.

08:04.035 --> 08:05.785
Well, ma'am, I hope
your meeting went well,

08:05.836 --> 08:08.087
because the rest of your
day is a logistical hell.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.172
Is there any way you can make
that sound more appealing?

08:10.207 --> 08:12.091
Well, I could add the word
"cookie" on the end for no reason.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.543
She can't practice
not having the twitch.

08:14.594 --> 08:16.178
She can practice that.

08:16.213 --> 08:17.797
It's called
"muscle memory."

08:17.848 --> 08:20.688
- This is gonna be on television.
- What about Botox?

08:24.805 --> 08:26.722
 We're getting
ready for showtime.

08:26.773 --> 08:29.892
- Sure am, boss. Sure am.
- Yep, yep.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.395
- How are you feeling? 
- It's hot. It feels hot in here.

08:32.397 --> 08:33.863
Yes, it's fine.
Thank you very much.

08:33.897 --> 08:35.481
- Welcome to the University of
New Hampshire. - Thank you.

08:35.532 --> 08:38.532
We're gonna be onstage in about
five minutes, everybody.

08:39.285 --> 08:41.904
It's like being dropped into
enemy territory unarmed.

08:43.740 --> 08:46.325
- Oh, nice to see you, Congressman Pierce.
- Madam Vice President.

08:46.376 --> 08:49.128
Hope you're not feeling too-- well, I
guess you are feeling a little nervous.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.914
- Hey, George. - Hi. How are you?
I like the new hair getup.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.417
- Oh, thank you. 
- You'd fit right in in the military.

08:54.419 --> 08:56.669
Sir, might I say, you
look very presidential.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.721
Get me some fruit, some mango.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.589
Yes, sir, of course.
Absolutely.

09:00.640 --> 09:01.924
Well, here it is,
game one of the series.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.926
Joe Thornhill.
What are you gonna do?

09:03.928 --> 09:06.178
You gonna hit one out of
the park, "Shoeless Joe"?

09:06.229 --> 09:08.564
- Well, I'm gonna try, ma'am.
- Maybe we're gonna be surprised

09:08.598 --> 09:10.599
- by our "pinch hitter" over here.
-  You never know.

09:10.650 --> 09:13.769
My parents did not allow
me to play sports

09:13.771 --> 09:15.571
growing up, so...

09:16.740 --> 09:18.700
That's a shame.

09:18.742 --> 09:20.659
Oh, I wonder if we
should take a picture.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.945
- Do you think that would be a good idea?
- Good idea.

09:22.947 --> 09:25.581
- Should we, um...
- No, I think...

09:25.615 --> 09:28.334
I have a much better camera.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.537
All right, say who's
gonna be president!

09:31.588 --> 09:33.028
- No, no.
- No.

09:34.291 --> 09:37.126
Mr. Egan, I see you've shaved.
Wise.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.796
You don't have the facial
gravitas for a beard.

09:40.798 --> 09:42.631
It's so smooth, it's amazing.

09:42.682 --> 09:44.800
It's like touching a child's face.
Here, try it.

09:44.851 --> 09:47.186
I don't enjoy touching
children's faces.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.054
And neither should you.

09:49.106 --> 09:51.307
Hey, "Dan Flew Over
The Cuckoo's Nest."

09:51.358 --> 09:53.809
How's it going, buddy?
You gonna self-harm?

09:53.811 --> 09:55.277
Can I live stream it?

09:55.312 --> 09:58.030
You know, a lot of that aggression
comes from insecurity, buddy.

09:58.064 --> 10:00.533
How are you gonna manage
all this craziness?

10:00.567 --> 10:03.652
Well, I don't just
manage, ma'am, I coach.

10:03.654 --> 10:04.987
And I'm gonna coach America.

10:05.038 --> 10:08.157
- You're talking to me now.
- I was just practicing.

10:08.159 --> 10:11.494
Okay. But I mean,
if it doesn't pan out,

10:11.496 --> 10:13.162
well, I guess you'll
just have happy memories

10:13.164 --> 10:16.382
to bring home to--
where is it?

10:16.466 --> 10:18.717
I believe they still call
it the White House, ma'am.

10:18.752 --> 10:19.969
- You gonna come visit me?
- Visit?

10:20.003 --> 10:21.971
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna redecorate.

10:22.005 --> 10:23.672
- Oh, okay.
- Sorry to interrupt, ma'am.

10:23.674 --> 10:26.355
- You go right ahead.
- Thank you. I just wanted to make sure

10:26.393 --> 10:28.761
that you had all the numbers
on the "sanctuary states."

10:30.730 --> 10:32.982
Oh-- oh, yes.
Yes, I do. Yes.

10:33.016 --> 10:34.733
Because you need them all.
Otherwise you'd be screwed.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.235
- Yeah.
- Completely.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.154
That's cute, little mind games.

10:38.188 --> 10:40.356
I happen to know all about
sanctuary states, ladies.

10:40.358 --> 10:43.025
See you later.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.493
- All right.
- Yeah.

10:44.528 --> 10:46.362
- I think I just did--
- The twitch is back.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.080
The twitch is back, yeah.
I cannot believe it.

10:48.114 --> 10:50.449
No, that's in the past
and you have to go forward.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.867
Oh, my God.
Twitchy is back.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.035
- Shit!
- What?

10:53.037 --> 10:54.086
Don't sweat it.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.038
You have to literally not sweat.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.873
You don't want
to go Nixon on us.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.376
You can turn sideways.
Twitch, smile, turn.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.545
- And the three Rs.
- I have the three Rs.

11:02.596 --> 11:05.181
- "Reform, reaffirm, renew."
- No, "renew."

11:05.215 --> 11:07.016
That's what I just said, renew.

11:07.050 --> 11:08.717
She looks like Peter Falk.

11:08.719 --> 11:11.220
Maybe a fourth R?
Maybe just "relax."

11:11.222 --> 11:13.222
- No. 
- Madam Vice President, 30 seconds to air.

11:13.224 --> 11:16.275
- Thank you.
- Is the twitch really bad?

11:16.309 --> 11:18.227
Yes.

11:18.229 --> 11:19.945
- Okay.
- Yeah.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.897
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

11:21.899 --> 11:23.566
the candidates
for tonight's debate.

11:23.617 --> 11:25.568
Joe Thornhill.

11:25.619 --> 11:29.071
Former Secretary of Defense
George Maddox.

11:29.073 --> 11:31.323
Vice Preside Selina Meyer.

11:31.374 --> 11:33.075
- Madam Vice President.
- How do you do?

11:33.126 --> 11:35.878
Here's my favorite part, where they all
pretend like they like each other.

11:35.912 --> 11:37.079
 Governor Danny Chung.

11:37.081 --> 11:38.130
Fuck Broadway.
This is real acting.

11:38.164 --> 11:40.716
Congressman Owen Pierce.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.419
Nice air kiss. I think he
actually missed the air.

11:43.421 --> 11:45.421
- Welcome, all of you.
- Thank you.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.506
-  Let's get started.
- Now he spills his water!

11:47.557 --> 11:49.758
I swear, this kid is literally
gonna shit himself.

11:49.809 --> 11:53.262
Joe Thornhill,
you're an ex-baseball coach.

11:53.264 --> 11:56.398
People say you're way out
of your league, literally.

11:56.433 --> 11:59.652
- Shouldn't you get off the field?
- You know, ma'am...

11:59.686 --> 12:01.403
I'm just an ordinary guy

12:01.438 --> 12:03.906
and I live in the real America.

12:03.940 --> 12:06.191
I may not know much
about running the country,

12:06.243 --> 12:08.944
I'll give you that.
But you know what?

12:08.946 --> 12:10.412
Neither did George Washington.

12:10.447 --> 12:13.916
Very good. Now compare yourself
to Lincoln and Buddha.

12:13.950 --> 12:16.085
What you need is some coaching.

12:16.119 --> 12:18.003
And I want to be  your coach.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.789
I want to coach America.

12:20.791 --> 12:23.676
And if you'll have me,

12:23.710 --> 12:25.794
well, I guarantee you...

12:25.845 --> 12:28.097
we're going all the way
to the pennant.

12:28.131 --> 12:31.300
Thank you very much.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.604
Thornhill's dial tests
are off the dial.

12:35.639 --> 12:36.805
The focus groups love him.

12:36.807 --> 12:39.058
The public will vote
for anybody they recognize.

12:39.109 --> 12:42.194
We could lose to the whale
from "Free Willy."

12:42.228 --> 12:44.697
Today, we're here
to talk about records.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.232
And my record clearly shows

12:47.284 --> 12:50.235
that unlike some of us,
I have been tested.

12:50.287 --> 12:52.738
Here comes the burning tank story
where he saves the one guy

12:52.789 --> 12:54.907
and the rest of us
get fuckin' tortured.

12:54.958 --> 12:58.961
...when I saved
my friend

12:58.995 --> 13:01.664
on the field of battle

13:01.715 --> 13:03.082
from a burning tank...

13:03.133 --> 13:06.418
I wasn't thinking about myself.

13:06.469 --> 13:08.470
I was thinking about my friend.

13:08.505 --> 13:10.472
I was thinking about his family.

13:10.507 --> 13:12.725
Look at him throwing
his water everywhere.

13:12.759 --> 13:15.227
He should have been there
when the tank was on fire.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.146
God, how does this kid
feed himself?

13:17.180 --> 13:19.932
Mike, you said Wendy would be here.
Where is she?

13:19.983 --> 13:23.352
She's not my dog, Amy-- who actually
isn't very well at the moment.

13:23.354 --> 13:24.903
I don't care, Mike.
Just get Wendy here, okay?

13:24.938 --> 13:27.022
She's got a problem
with an anal gland.

13:27.024 --> 13:28.407
I'm talking about the dog.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.942
Oh, there she is.
Hey, tiger.

13:29.993 --> 13:33.078
- Aha! Hey--
So, Gary...

13:33.113 --> 13:35.447
- talk to Wendy about Selina.
- What?

13:35.498 --> 13:37.866
- The thing we-- the--
- Wendy, hey.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.669
We are so excited about the
Veep's new look, Wendy.

13:40.704 --> 13:43.504
W-we think it's
young-- makes her look younger,

13:43.506 --> 13:45.541
- but it's age-appropriate, I feel.
- Nice to see you, too, Gary.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.876
- Hey. 
- Hey, relax. It's a puff piece, all right?

13:47.927 --> 13:50.012
I'm with "Style" section now.
You don't have to do that.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.513
People are being
so critical, Wendy.

13:51.548 --> 13:53.428
I mean, they think
she looks like a lesbian.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.051
Shit! I didn't just say that.
I'm sorry.

13:56.102 --> 13:58.354
Gary, stop being so nervous.
Watch me.

13:58.388 --> 13:59.888
"Oh, I love
your tie."

13:59.890 --> 14:02.107
See? Basilly brain-dead.
Don't worry.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.726
- Secretary Maddox.
- Yes?

14:03.728 --> 14:06.311
You've been with the
military exclusively.

14:06.363 --> 14:09.114
What makes you qualified
to be the president?

14:09.149 --> 14:13.452
I'm a man of words that the
American people can understand.

14:15.405 --> 14:18.207
I'm talking about words like...

14:18.241 --> 14:21.910
the economy...
jobs...

14:21.912 --> 14:24.997
World's worst boy-band
member ever right there.

14:25.048 --> 14:29.718
It's a simple
and direct language.

14:29.753 --> 14:31.920
And, uh, ahem...

14:31.922 --> 14:33.589
He looks like he just
came out of the bathroom

14:33.640 --> 14:35.974
and then decided that
he hadn't finished yet.

14:36.009 --> 14:39.344
It's a language that I feel

14:39.396 --> 14:42.097
the American people
wanna listen to.

14:42.099 --> 14:45.517
I feel your pain.
You okay?

14:45.568 --> 14:47.519
I'll be better
when you walk away.

14:47.570 --> 14:50.022
If only we could all
just walk away.

14:50.073 --> 14:52.274
And now to you,
Madam Vice President.

14:52.276 --> 14:55.611
Your personal trainer caused
some controversy recently

14:55.613 --> 14:57.029
and had to be dismissed.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.114
What do you say
 to the accusation

14:59.165 --> 15:00.916
that you care too much
about image

15:00.950 --> 15:03.502
and aren't making a real
difference to America?

15:03.536 --> 15:05.454
Before I answer it,
I'd like to start off

15:05.456 --> 15:08.257
by saying I would like
to be the first

15:08.291 --> 15:11.927
to thank the kind folks

15:11.961 --> 15:13.846
here at the University
of New Hampshire--

15:13.880 --> 15:16.548
the faculty, the staff,
the students, of course--

15:16.599 --> 15:18.300
 Absolutely.
- for--

15:18.351 --> 15:20.185
Excuse me, Congressman?

15:20.220 --> 15:22.387
I was-- yes.
Yes, ma'am, absolutely.

15:22.439 --> 15:25.557
Great. I do want to
answer that question.

15:25.608 --> 15:27.392
I've got to say,
I like this new look.

15:27.444 --> 15:28.977
- You do?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

15:28.979 --> 15:30.813
- Nice. 
- I mean, it's better than that London outfit.

15:30.864 --> 15:34.066
- That hat was crazy. 
- I did not have anything to do with that.

15:34.117 --> 15:35.868
- Ray chose that hat.
- Ray the trainer?

15:35.902 --> 15:37.463
- Yeah.
- Ray has a say?

15:37.487 --> 15:40.372
She does not say nay to Ray.
You know what I'm sayin'?

15:42.993 --> 15:44.543
What kind of stuff?

15:45.829 --> 15:47.496
 I did have
a fitness trainer.

15:47.498 --> 15:50.799
However, this gentleman
did not make any decisions

15:50.834 --> 15:53.335
in my office
under any circumstances.

15:53.386 --> 15:56.555
I choose my own outfits,
I stay in shape,

15:56.589 --> 15:58.841
I make the decisions
in my office,

15:58.843 --> 16:01.426
and I am the best
multitasker on my team.

16:01.511 --> 16:04.012
She just said the opposite
of what you said.

16:04.063 --> 16:06.515
No...

16:06.517 --> 16:09.318
- Yes.
- You can't use that. Please don't use that.

16:09.352 --> 16:12.437
You just gave me
a good scoop on Ray.

16:12.489 --> 16:14.573
I'm not gonna ignore that.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.609
Okay.

16:19.863 --> 16:21.530
Hello, Mike.

16:21.532 --> 16:23.499
I just told Wendy
that Ray picked the hat,

16:23.533 --> 16:25.200
but then Selina said
that he didn't,

16:25.202 --> 16:27.286
so now Wendy knows
that Selina's lying.

16:27.337 --> 16:29.338
I'm sorry, Gary.
You lost me at "Hello."

16:29.372 --> 16:31.590
- How are we doing?
- Well, Thornhill is still,

16:31.624 --> 16:34.042
to use a baseball
analogy, "winning."

16:34.127 --> 16:37.546
Dan, get on the phone. Find
me Thornhill's snatch, now.

16:37.548 --> 16:39.548
Call every whore
and mistress in America

16:39.599 --> 16:42.017
until you find the right one.

16:42.051 --> 16:45.387
You do remember that he had
a breakdown recently?

16:45.438 --> 16:47.606
Oh, Jesus, Kent. It was,
like, three weeks ago.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.775
Besides, Selina is
waiting for the signal.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.777
- We need to out this affair.
- Yeah, we do.

16:51.811 --> 16:53.445
We need to find
the "smoking hon'."

16:53.479 --> 16:55.397
As in "honey."
That doesn't work.

16:55.399 --> 16:56.565
That's not clear. I've
got a bad stomach cramp.

16:56.567 --> 16:58.233
I think I might be coming
down with a bug or something.

16:58.235 --> 17:00.736
 Congressman Pierce,

17:00.738 --> 17:03.155
you've served in Congress
for four years now.

17:03.206 --> 17:05.240
How does that affect
your vision for America?

17:05.242 --> 17:08.242
The America that I see now

17:08.328 --> 17:10.628
is a mess.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.665
Our economy
is going down the drain.

17:13.715 --> 17:17.301
If our government is going
to take everything from us,

17:17.337 --> 17:19.087
bar the kitchen sink,

17:19.137 --> 17:21.473
they might want to take...

17:21.507 --> 17:23.592
the plug as well.

17:25.094 --> 17:26.845
Why a plug?

17:26.896 --> 17:30.399
To... plug up the plug hole.

17:30.433 --> 17:33.518
- It was a joke.
- He's making a joke.

17:33.570 --> 17:34.820
Guess I'm the only one
with a sense of humor.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.273
We should put this guy in Vegas.

17:38.275 --> 17:39.775
I mean, anywhere but here.

17:39.777 --> 17:41.610
If newspapers
still had cartoonists,

17:41.612 --> 17:44.329
they could do something
really clever with that plug.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.582
Hey, Jackson, are you working
for him and not telling us?

17:46.616 --> 17:49.418
Everybody here
doesn't hate me, right?

17:51.621 --> 17:53.505
Baby, we have a little
situation here.

17:53.539 --> 17:55.624
Okay, just what exactly
did Gary say, okay?

17:55.626 --> 17:57.125
You didn't say anything
about FLOTUS, did you?

17:57.127 --> 17:59.127
No, but you just did.

17:59.129 --> 18:01.129
FLOTUS?
What about FLOTUS?

18:01.180 --> 18:02.598
I didn't say anything
about FLOTUS.

18:02.632 --> 18:05.267
- She's a reporter.
- Shut up.

18:05.301 --> 18:06.885
Hey, what's going on
with FLOTUS?

18:06.936 --> 18:08.937
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

18:08.972 --> 18:11.106
- I have to write about something, so...
- Okay, babe, look.

18:11.140 --> 18:13.642
I'm gonna give you
the Joe Thornhill affair.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.311
- Thornhill had an affair? 
- What the hell is wrong with you?

18:16.362 --> 18:18.363
That's okay. That's good with me.
I'll take that.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.949
- Good boy.
- Good boy, good boy, good boy.

18:20.984 --> 18:22.868
Governor Chung,
we live in a time

18:22.952 --> 18:26.371
when young people find it
increasingly hard to find work.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.906
How would you address
 this issue?

18:27.957 --> 18:29.825
Ten bucks he says,
"Bring back the draft."

18:29.827 --> 18:31.543
You know, I'm not trying to say

18:31.577 --> 18:34.496
that you should join up
and serve your country,

18:34.580 --> 18:37.582
but there are other options
for the young adults--

18:37.634 --> 18:39.384
I'd love to field this one,
Governor Chung, if you don't mind.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.970
I'm sorry, the question
was directed to me.

18:42.005 --> 18:45.223
But this is a question that
is very near to my heart.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.925
 Are we all allowed
to speak at once now?

18:46.976 --> 18:48.677
Is that how it's gonna work?

18:48.728 --> 18:50.312
You know what? I would like to
hear what the coach has to say.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.648
- That's manager.
-  Manager. That's fine.

18:52.682 --> 18:54.433
You know, as someone

18:54.484 --> 18:56.601
who's spent my entire
professional career

18:56.653 --> 18:58.820
working with young athletes

18:58.855 --> 19:00.155
helping them to achieve
their potential

19:00.189 --> 19:02.741
and, indeed, become role models,

19:02.775 --> 19:05.994
young adult unemployment has
always been a priority for me.

19:06.029 --> 19:07.362
He's blocking Selina.

19:07.413 --> 19:08.580
That guy's smarter
than he looks.

19:08.614 --> 19:10.165
Mind you, he'd have to be.

19:10.199 --> 19:13.702
Seems to me the vice president
has taken her eye off the ball.

19:13.704 --> 19:17.039
She's become distracted by
the trappings of her office.

19:17.090 --> 19:20.375
I think it's time we stopped worrying
about people up on the Hill.

19:20.426 --> 19:23.462
According to the dials,
Thornhill's still out front.

19:23.513 --> 19:25.597
Okay, we really, really need

19:25.631 --> 19:27.432
that woman who fucked
him to fuck him.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.601
- We need Joe's ho. 
- I'm just waiting for one more source

19:29.635 --> 19:31.970
to corroborate the story.
Wait, wait, wait.

19:32.021 --> 19:34.556
- He fucked her.
- Oh-hh!

19:34.607 --> 19:37.059
This feels better than
actually having sex yourself.

19:37.110 --> 19:40.479
Now, as a military man,
I know that true leadership

19:40.530 --> 19:43.815
takes strategy, it takes
planning, it takes a vision.

19:43.866 --> 19:46.034
Now, today,  we're not here...

19:46.069 --> 19:48.870
-  to talk about personal trainers

19:48.905 --> 19:52.541
or baseball
or... plugs.

19:52.575 --> 19:54.493
I certainly hope
that the governor

19:54.544 --> 19:57.129
is not suggesting that
I haven't been tested.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.748
I've served my entire life

19:59.750 --> 20:02.134
under the scrutiny
of the public eye,

20:02.168 --> 20:06.254
and I have no skeletons
whatsoever in my closet.

20:06.256 --> 20:10.008
The question is, can we
all say the same here?

20:10.093 --> 20:11.694
I need this story
coming out of every TV,

20:11.728 --> 20:13.428
phone, laptop, and
hairdresser in America.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.731
- Dan, you get the press ready.
- Yeah.

20:15.765 --> 20:18.934
Well, I'm glad you raised that
issue, Madam Vice President.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.019
I've got something
very important

20:21.070 --> 20:23.939
I would like to share
with the American people.

20:23.941 --> 20:27.109
I just wanna be honest.

20:27.160 --> 20:30.612
Many years ago,
I had a brief affair.

20:30.614 --> 20:33.865
- I deeply regret it.
- He's confessing?

20:33.916 --> 20:35.367
Crap.

20:35.418 --> 20:39.204
If there's any dirty trick that
I cannot stand, it is honesty.

20:39.255 --> 20:41.373
...and support
of my amazing wife, Chrissy.

20:41.424 --> 20:44.793
We got out the other side
stronger than ever.

20:44.795 --> 20:47.796
Strong enough for me
to tell you this, America.

20:47.798 --> 20:49.965
If you can forgive me,

20:49.967 --> 20:51.850
then you can vote for me.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.852
My amazing wife Chrissy,
ladies and gentlemen.

20:53.886 --> 20:57.305
-  There she is, my darlin'. There she is.

20:58.808 --> 21:02.394
I hate confessions, unless they've
been beaten out of someone.

21:02.445 --> 21:04.646
Thornhill just ran
the Thornhill story,

21:04.697 --> 21:06.782
which makes my
Thornhill story useless.

21:06.816 --> 21:09.067
So now you have to
tell me about FLOTUS.

21:09.118 --> 21:11.620
I can't tell you about FLOTUS.
FLOTUS is a no-go-tus.

21:11.654 --> 21:13.054
Then I can run the story on Ray.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.739
I can't let you run
the story about Ray.

21:14.791 --> 21:17.242
But I love you. Does that
make everything better?

21:17.293 --> 21:20.045
This is what our marriage
is gonna be? This?

21:20.079 --> 21:23.832
It doesn't have to be. Wait,
what are we talking about?

21:23.834 --> 21:26.668
There's always gonna be
a conflict of interest.

21:26.670 --> 21:28.720
But that's what marriage is--
a conflict of interests.

21:28.754 --> 21:31.640
No. Marriage is being able to
tell each other everything

21:31.674 --> 21:33.225
- and finding-- 
- Are you guys fighting? Please don't fight.

21:33.259 --> 21:35.644
- Gary, get the hell out of my marriage.
- Okay, got it.

21:35.678 --> 21:37.896
Mike, I'm really nervous about
all these haircut questions.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.764
- Nobody cares.
- Yeah, okay.

21:39.816 --> 21:43.185
We have 11
million illegal immigrants

21:43.187 --> 21:45.270
currently living
in the U.S. today.

21:45.321 --> 21:47.772
What do we do about them?
Madam Vice President?

21:47.824 --> 21:50.909
I have a very clear strategy

21:50.943 --> 21:53.111
that I would like to share
with everybody today.

21:54.914 --> 21:58.083
I call it
my "three Rs."

21:58.117 --> 21:59.534
It's time
for the "three Rs."

21:59.585 --> 22:01.870
They're solid
as a rock, rock, rock.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.873
Number one--
we need to reform.

22:04.875 --> 22:08.627
But we can't do it
without bipartisan support.

22:08.678 --> 22:10.846
And that is something
that I am confident,

22:10.880 --> 22:14.599
with my experience,
I can absolutely secure.

22:14.634 --> 22:19.554
Number two--
we need to reaffirm.

22:19.605 --> 22:22.140
We need to reaffirm
our commitment

22:22.191 --> 22:26.394
to highly skilled,
 legal immigrant workers.

22:26.445 --> 22:29.064
Number three--
the...

22:29.115 --> 22:31.733
the third R.

22:31.735 --> 22:35.120
Um... uh...

22:35.154 --> 22:37.122
Renew, renew. The
third R is "renew."

22:37.156 --> 22:38.790
She forgot the third R.

22:38.824 --> 22:40.375
The third R is--

22:40.409 --> 22:43.211
actually, in fact, let me
go back to "reaffirm,"

22:43.246 --> 22:44.663
which was number two.

22:44.714 --> 22:46.164
Do we have any snipers?
Can we take her out?

22:46.215 --> 22:48.333
You got a gun?
I'll do it.

22:48.384 --> 22:51.586
...immigrants whose descendants,
of course, run companies.

22:51.588 --> 22:55.257
Successful companies
like Clovis in Silicon Valley,

22:55.308 --> 22:57.259
where I had the good fortune
to visit earlier this year.

22:57.310 --> 22:58.426
- Madam Vice President?
- Yes?

22:58.477 --> 23:00.428
- Your time is nearly up.
-  Oh, dear.

23:00.479 --> 23:02.180
You mentioned a third R?

23:02.231 --> 23:03.598
Thank you so much, Andrea.

23:03.649 --> 23:06.434
And I'm absolutely
gonna get to that.

23:06.485 --> 23:08.320
Jesus, that is a wicked twitch.

23:08.354 --> 23:10.355
- I can't watch this.
- Neither can she,

23:10.406 --> 23:11.606
'cause her fuckin' eyes
don't work.

23:11.657 --> 23:15.110
It is... "repel."

23:15.112 --> 23:16.578
That's right.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.213
"Repel"?
Why did she say "repel"?

23:18.247 --> 23:20.031
What is it,
"Talk Like A Pirate Day"?

23:20.082 --> 23:24.286
I mean we need to repel
unwanted immigration.

23:24.337 --> 23:26.955
We need to repel criminals,

23:26.957 --> 23:28.290
we need to repel obesity,

23:28.341 --> 23:31.126
we need to repel torturers.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.460
I think I've endorsed a Nazi.

23:32.511 --> 23:33.628
That would explain
the Hitler haircut.

23:33.630 --> 23:38.266
We need to repel
the enemies of America.

23:38.301 --> 23:41.353
Thank you.

23:43.472 --> 23:45.390
Maybe I should have
gone with two Rs.

23:45.441 --> 23:47.025
Hey, I got
three Fs for ya--

23:47.059 --> 23:49.444
you're fucked,
you fuckin' fucker.

23:49.478 --> 23:52.731
Holy crapcakes!
They're loving her.

23:52.782 --> 23:55.066
I know. It seems every
time she says "repel,"

23:55.117 --> 23:56.818
she attracts more voters.

23:56.820 --> 23:59.738
We have a question now from
a member of our audience,

23:59.789 --> 24:01.456
Angela Rodriguez.

24:01.490 --> 24:02.958
My mom lost her house

24:02.992 --> 24:05.243
because the banks
 refused to lower the rates.

24:05.294 --> 24:06.995
My dad passed away
 and she had to pay

24:07.046 --> 24:08.830
for the mortgage
 out of her savings.

24:08.832 --> 24:11.383
- What's he doing?
- Now, my mother lost her house.

24:11.417 --> 24:15.420
No, don't look at the twitch.
Focus on the "dead dad lady."

24:15.471 --> 24:18.423
- Secretary Maddox?
- Hmm?

24:18.474 --> 24:22.344
Oh, uh... yeah.
I'm very sorry to hear

24:22.346 --> 24:25.647
about what happened
to your mom, and...

24:25.681 --> 24:27.682
I don't think
we should be penalizing

24:27.733 --> 24:30.685
any hardworking Americans.

24:32.188 --> 24:33.521
But here's the thing, Andrea.

24:33.572 --> 24:35.407
-  Angela.
- It is-- huh?

24:35.441 --> 24:36.992
Angela.
My name is Angela.

24:37.026 --> 24:38.610
 Angela.
 Right, right, right.

24:38.661 --> 24:41.029
There are some loopholes.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.947
What we need to do

24:42.999 --> 24:45.533
is to find those loopholes

24:45.535 --> 24:47.786
and find out...

24:47.837 --> 24:50.205
whether--
are they loopholes

24:50.289 --> 24:53.091
or are they legitimate holes?

24:53.125 --> 24:55.510
What the hell
is a legitimate hole?

24:55.544 --> 24:57.712
Well,
don't get me started.

24:57.763 --> 25:02.267
That's the question that we
should be asking ourselves.

25:02.351 --> 25:04.102
- If I may--?
-  Please be brief, Congressman.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.297
With absolute--
with regard to holes,

25:06.305 --> 25:08.973
and notwithstanding the humor
that was poked at me earlier,

25:09.025 --> 25:10.725
and I'm certainly
a fan of humor--

25:10.727 --> 25:12.310
can't get by
without it--

25:12.361 --> 25:14.646
but I think the point
about holes is well taken

25:14.697 --> 25:16.314
and sort of circles
back to my point

25:16.365 --> 25:17.982
about plug holes
earlier--

25:18.034 --> 25:19.401
Well, not--
not-- not quite.

25:19.403 --> 25:23.405
But it-- we wanna find those
holes or the loopholes.

25:23.407 --> 25:25.874
Just stop saying "hole."

25:25.908 --> 25:29.577
- It's not that bad.
- No, as a "hole," it's not that bad.

25:29.579 --> 25:31.629
But we wanna stay
above the hole.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.748
We don't wanna go down the hole.

25:33.750 --> 25:35.967
He's gonna disappear
up his own "hole" hole.

25:36.001 --> 25:37.752
If I get your vote,

25:37.803 --> 25:39.754
you won't go down that hole.

25:39.805 --> 25:42.674
I wanna bring everybody
above the hole.

25:42.725 --> 25:46.478
We all want to live
above the hole.

25:46.512 --> 25:49.597
- That sounds like a slogan, folks.

25:49.599 --> 25:52.734
And once again, we'd like
to express our appreciation

25:52.768 --> 25:55.103
- to each of the candidates.
- Thank you.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.942
Oh, well. You didn't get
much of a chance to speak, did you?

26:00.944 --> 26:03.328
No, I didn't. Remember that third R.

26:03.362 --> 26:07.115
Thornhill, 30%.
Selina, second, 25.

26:07.117 --> 26:11.035
Chung, 22, Pierce, 9, Maddox, 8.

26:11.087 --> 26:14.422
Maddox dialed "M"
for "Murdered Himself."

26:14.457 --> 26:16.458
God, look at Pierce.

26:16.509 --> 26:18.710
He looks like he just
got out of sex prison.

26:18.761 --> 26:20.962
He's not gonna cry, is he?

26:20.964 --> 26:23.631
Now Maddox's daughter is
gonna give him the bad news.

26:23.682 --> 26:25.467
"Daddy,
you fuckin' blew it!"

26:25.518 --> 26:28.470
"Daddy, I've never been
less proud of you."

26:28.521 --> 26:30.638
Well, thank God for Twitchy.
He really saved us.

26:30.689 --> 26:32.474
I love that little guy.

26:32.525 --> 26:34.726
Now he's got to convince everyone
the three Rs don't stand

26:34.777 --> 26:36.945
for "racist," "right wing,"
and "racist."

26:36.979 --> 26:40.315
Aw, shit! I'm gonna get so many
questions about this hair.

26:40.317 --> 26:42.400
I can give you a ton
of lines for this.

26:42.451 --> 26:45.203
Yeah, okay.
That's not reassuring.

26:45.237 --> 26:47.739
Hey, Dan. Dan.

26:47.790 --> 26:50.590
I just want to say I'm sorry
if I wasn't very sympathetic

26:50.626 --> 26:52.377
to your, you know,
mental head issues.

26:52.411 --> 26:55.663
So... I'm sorry.
Friends?

26:57.917 --> 27:00.385
Go fuck yourself, "Jack and
the Giant Freakstalk."

27:00.419 --> 27:02.670
Your team lost, and you should
be fitted with a leper bell,

27:02.721 --> 27:04.639
you sinking shit.

27:08.177 --> 27:09.928
Yeah, okay.

27:09.979 --> 27:11.763
Boy, I do not know
what I saw in you.

27:11.814 --> 27:15.016
I do. He's a less talented
ugly version of me.

27:15.018 --> 27:17.018
He's basically
a human comfort blanket.

27:18.821 --> 27:21.906
Remember when I came up with
"short hair for the long haul"?

27:21.941 --> 27:23.992
When?
What? No.

27:24.026 --> 27:25.860
Cheer up. Coming
in second is good.

27:25.862 --> 27:27.829
It's especially
true with opening debates.

27:27.863 --> 27:30.248
- Also with fucking. 
- It's not enough. We have to win.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.534
And if you can't stand the
heat, buy asbestos panties.

27:32.585 --> 27:34.869
See, now that's the kind of
talk that gets me turned on.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.038
We're gonna have another
twitch to deal with here.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.707
I wouldn't say "repel"
is a strong word.

27:39.709 --> 27:45.013
It can mean also "to push
away gently with respect."

27:45.047 --> 27:47.265
I was pretty disappointed in
Governor Chung's performance,

27:47.299 --> 27:50.101
but I did learn that he
used to be a soldier.

27:50.135 --> 27:51.803
Learned that several times.

27:51.854 --> 27:54.939
Mike, I haven't gotten any
questions about her hair.

27:54.974 --> 27:57.358
Thank fuckin' God.

27:58.561 --> 28:00.562
Well, the...

28:00.613 --> 28:02.697
the hole is the hole.

28:02.731 --> 28:05.200
And the hole is the hole
that people fall into.

28:05.234 --> 28:08.203
And if they fall below the line,
they will fall into the hole.

28:08.237 --> 28:11.372
And we want to keep them
from falling below the line

28:11.407 --> 28:13.208
and then into the hole...
or off the map.

28:13.242 --> 28:16.411
Because if they're in the hole,
how are you gonna get out?
