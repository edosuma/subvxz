Marcus' birthday...

01:12.656 --> 01:13.949

He's high on painkillers!

to the party and cut the cake?

01:44.939 --> 01:46.107
Who could eat cake
at a time like this?!

01:48.859 --> 01:50.319
Another drug overdose?

01:50.486 --> 01:51.612
Most likely.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.405
Percocet and OxyContin

01:53.572 --> 01:55.574
found wrapped
in his cheese cloth.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.952
Prescription drugs
but with no prescription.

01:58.119 --> 02:00.871
You guys know where all these
illegal meds are coming from?

02:01.038 --> 02:02.748
Most likely
from the prisons.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.333
Whenever there's
a drug epidemic,

02:04.500 --> 02:06.335
you can usually trace it back
to people who've been

Oh, how nice of you.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.657
All right.
Arms in the air.

02:37.616 --> 02:38.784
What's the present?

02:38.951 --> 02:40.411
Just some Hummels.

to visit.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.898
Did you bring grandpa
a present?

03:09.064 --> 03:10.774
Yeah I got
what you wanted.

03:13.194 --> 03:16.280
Aw, Merry Wanderer

03:16.447 --> 03:17.823
These Hummels suck!

03:17.990 --> 03:19.116

the guy gave me!

03:19.283 --> 03:21.035
It's okay, Billy.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.870
I'm just gonna need you
to deliver another one

03:23.037 --> 03:25.331
of Ms. McGullicutty's
crochet pillows.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.665
Aw, come on, Grandpa!

03:26.832 --> 03:27.875
Isn't it enough
I come to visit?

03:28.042 --> 03:30.794
You don't understand
how it works in here!

03:30.961 --> 03:33.505
Ms. McGullicutty
is top bitch.

03:33.672 --> 03:37.801
You do what she says
or you pay the price.

03:45.809 --> 03:48.938
No, please,
I-I don't want no trouble!

03:49.104 --> 03:51.649
I'm sorry!
I'll get better Hummels!

03:55.736 --> 03:57.279
Dude, Stan!
Come on, dude.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.365
We're gonna go set off fireworks
at Kenny's house.

03:59.531 --> 04:00.824
I will. I just got to do this
for my grandpa first.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.159
Again?!

04:02.326 --> 04:03.494
Dude, how many crappy
crochet pillows

04:03.661 --> 04:04.870
do you have to
give out for him?

04:05.037 --> 04:06.497
I don't know.
It's what he wants.

04:06.664 --> 04:08.290
I feel bad for him, all right?
I think he's miserable.

04:08.457 --> 04:09.959
He's old.
He's supposed to be miserable.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.460
Look, I just got to
make this exchange for him

04:11.627 --> 04:14.672
and then we can go.
Oh, oh, I think this is her now.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.467
Are you Stan Marsh?

04:18.634 --> 04:19.885
It's me, Swiper.

04:20.052 --> 04:22.471
Cool.
Do you have the Hummel?

04:24.640 --> 04:25.766
This is it.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.518
Ride into Christmas.
Limited Edition.

04:27.685 --> 04:28.686
Now give me
the pillow.

04:28.852 --> 04:29.937
I have to get
to a birthday party.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.647
'Kay, fine.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.943
All right. Peace!

04:36.110 --> 04:37.945
Dude, that's
really weird.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.863
Old people
love Hummels, dude.

04:42.992 --> 04:44.868
Students, faculty,
and staff,

04:45.035 --> 04:46.287
today, we are facing

04:46.453 --> 04:47.955
an epidemic of
catastrophic proportions.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.707
I know I am not alone
in mourning the loss

04:49.873 --> 04:53.335
of one our greatest
entertainers, Chuck E. Cheese.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.546
Had we known the personal hell
he was going through,

04:55.713 --> 04:57.006
perhaps we could
have helped.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.382
But too many were
more than eager

04:58.549 --> 05:00.217
to supply Chuck E.
with the opioids

05:00.384 --> 05:02.136
that caused
his untimely death.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.096
Chuck E. was not the first
entertainer in our community

05:04.263 --> 05:05.389
to die from this epidemic.

05:05.556 --> 05:07.308
Let us not forget

05:07.474 --> 05:08.642
Dinkie Dook the clown,

05:08.809 --> 05:10.269
dead of a Roxanol overdose

05:10.436 --> 05:12.771
at Tommy Schneider's bar mitzvah
last March,

05:12.938 --> 05:14.523
Shimmer and Shine,
who both collapsed

05:14.690 --> 05:16.859
from massive amounts
of oxycodone in their systems

05:17.026 --> 05:19.069
at Nelly Anderson's
birthday party,

05:19.236 --> 05:21.405
Spiderman, cut down
in his prime by Demerol,

05:21.572 --> 05:23.657
and just recently,
Swiper the Fox,

05:23.824 --> 05:28.037
dead of multiple opioids
found inside his crochet pillow.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.581
How many more entertainers
must we lose

05:30.748 --> 05:32.291
before we take action?!

05:32.458 --> 05:35.961
It is time to declare war
on opioids in our society!

05:42.301 --> 05:43.802
Dude, what
the fuck, Stan?!

05:43.969 --> 05:45.763
I didn't know,
all right?!

05:45.929 --> 05:47.639
You didn't know you
were slinging drugs for your grandpa?

05:47.806 --> 05:49.350
It didn't occur to me
as a possibility.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.642
Dude, did you hear
everyone in school?

05:50.809 --> 05:52.227
They're coming after you!

05:52.394 --> 05:53.562
You killed Swiper the Fox,

05:53.729 --> 05:54.855
and we were
standing there with you!

05:55.022 --> 05:56.190
You got to tell people

05:56.357 --> 05:57.775
we had no idea
what was going on!

05:57.941 --> 05:59.485
<i>I</i> had no idea
what was going on!

05:59.651 --> 06:00.986
Hey, fellas!

06:03.572 --> 06:05.074
Boy, that Marcus kid
is on the warpath, huh?

06:05.240 --> 06:06.575
He's really motivated.

06:06.742 --> 06:07.993
I mean, screw that kid,
but I guess it's good

06:08.160 --> 06:09.244
somebody's finally
doing something

06:09.411 --> 06:11.663
about these goddamn
drug dealers.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.836
Well, see ya, fellas!

06:21.465 --> 06:23.050
Our only way out
is to go to the police right now

06:23.217 --> 06:24.802
and turn Stan's grandpa in!

06:24.968 --> 06:26.261
No, we don't have
to do that.

06:26.428 --> 06:29.098
Let me go talk to him.
I can put a stop to this.

06:29.264 --> 06:30.808
Grandpa, what the hell have you gotten me into?

06:30.974 --> 06:32.684
Shh! Quiet,
they'll hear you!

06:32.851 --> 06:34.978
There were drugs
in the crochet pillow, weren't there?

06:35.145 --> 06:36.438
Do you know
people are dying?!

06:36.605 --> 06:38.107
What do you
want me to do, Billy?

06:38.273 --> 06:40.109
You see Mrs. McGullicutty
over there?

06:40.275 --> 06:42.444
Whoever has
the best Hummel collection

06:42.611 --> 06:46.031
is top bitch in this place,
and she's got the best.

06:46.198 --> 06:49.618
She's ruthless, and she
has those old lady farts.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.203
You know
old lady farts, right?

06:51.370 --> 06:52.746
Where they're so loose

06:52.913 --> 06:54.123
they don't even acknowledge
they happened?

06:54.289 --> 06:56.375
Oh, hello,
Mr. Marsh.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.130
Ah! Mrs. McGullicutty.
How are you feeling today?

07:01.296 --> 07:03.048
I'm doing very well.

07:03.215 --> 07:06.885
Have they given you Percocet
for that knee of yours?

07:07.052 --> 07:09.138
Oh, uh, yeah, here.
I just got it.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.514
Here you go.

07:10.681 --> 07:11.974
Oh, you'd almost think

07:12.141 --> 07:14.226
you were trying
to keep them from me.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.770
Oh, uh, ma'am?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.355
My grandpa actually
really needs those drugs.

07:18.522 --> 07:19.773
He's in a lot of pain.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.984
Ooh, and who is
this little rascal?

07:22.151 --> 07:24.653
That's just my grandson.
He -- He's worthless.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.238
How sweet.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.115
Hmm? Coming to visit
your old papa

07:28.282 --> 07:29.533
in the joint, huh?

07:29.700 --> 07:31.785
You love your papa,
don't you?

07:31.952 --> 07:36.999
You'd hate to see him suffer
even more than he already is.

07:37.166 --> 07:38.959
You watch
your ass, Marsh,

07:39.126 --> 07:41.420
or I'll have you
sent to the quiet room.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.092
Wh--What is she talking about?
What's the quiet room?

07:47.259 --> 07:49.636
I told you -- She has
all the pull in here.

07:49.803 --> 07:53.557
You go against what she says,
you end up in solitaire.

07:53.724 --> 07:56.185
No. No, please!
I-I didn't do anything!

07:56.351 --> 07:57.686
It's all right,
Mr. Standish.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.354
You just need
a little quiet time.

07:59.521 --> 08:02.900
I don't even know
how to play solitaire! Please!

08:05.486 --> 08:06.778
I understand that, today,
they are performing

08:06.945 --> 08:08.155
Chuck E. Cheese's autopsy?

08:08.322 --> 08:10.365
Oh the kid's
party performer, yeah.

08:10.532 --> 08:11.492
As a concerned member
of the public,

08:11.658 --> 08:13.243
I wish to be present.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.497
Uh, sorry, children aren't
really allowed in autopsies.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.916
Then I shall wait here
to learn the coroner's findings!

08:19.082 --> 08:21.001
Toxicology report
shows subject

08:21.168 --> 08:23.921
had massive amounts of opioids
in system at time of death.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.798
Now proceeding.

08:37.434 --> 08:38.393
Have these
put in the garbage.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.603
What did you find,
coroner?

08:39.770 --> 08:41.230
Who is this?

08:41.396 --> 08:43.607
There is an epidemic
in our community, sir!

08:43.774 --> 08:45.442
Some of us actually
care to confront the problem.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.027
Now, damn it,
what did you find?

08:47.194 --> 08:48.946
Nothing out of the ordinary.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.948
The subject died
of a simple overdose.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.200
We found nothing else
except for two Hummels

08:53.367 --> 08:55.160
in the subject's
rectal cavity.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.329
Hummels?
In his rectal cavity, you say,

08:57.496 --> 08:59.665
and you do not find this
'out of the ordinary'?

08:59.831 --> 09:01.041
Not at all.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.334
We've found Hummels
in nearly all

09:02.501 --> 09:04.253
the birthday entertainer's
anal cavities.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.588
It's very common
in our overdose victims.

09:06.755 --> 09:07.965
Hmm...

09:08.131 --> 09:09.925
A bit too common,
don't you think?

09:13.971 --> 09:16.390
Guys, why does grandpa
have to be in the nursing home?

09:16.557 --> 09:17.683
Can't he
live with us again?

09:17.849 --> 09:19.393
Stan, grandpa has
a lot of needs

09:19.560 --> 09:21.353
that we can't
provide him here.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.438
He needs professional
supervision.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.023
Is that really it?
Because I-I just feel

09:25.190 --> 09:26.358
like we kind of
threw grandpa away

09:26.525 --> 09:27.234
and forgot about him.

09:27.401 --> 09:28.694
Oh, really?

09:28.860 --> 09:30.571
Do you have any idea
how much money we pay

09:30.737 --> 09:32.447
to have grandpa
in that place?

09:32.614 --> 09:34.491
Your grandpa
is styling.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.994
Can you imagine being able
to just sit around all day

09:37.160 --> 09:39.288
and not have to do anything
but eat and watch TV?

09:39.454 --> 09:41.415
Yeah, I'd probably go crazy
and want to kill myself.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.917
Jesus, Stan, it's not like
he's in jail.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.377
Yeah, it's kind of
like jail.

09:45.544 --> 09:46.628
You should go visit him.

09:46.795 --> 09:47.671
I can't.

09:47.838 --> 09:49.172
I'm too busy
busting my ass

09:49.339 --> 09:50.674
to pay the bills
for that place

09:50.841 --> 09:52.676
and to pay for
<i>your</i> guitar lessons.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.469
I don't have
guitar lessons.

09:54.636 --> 09:57.014
I don't want to go there.
It's depressing.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.850
Aw, you tricked me.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.768
Hello?

10:01.935 --> 10:04.438
Dude! Did you give Butters
a crochet pillow to drop off?

10:04.605 --> 10:06.315
Dude,
I don't have a choice.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.899
I have to get the Hummels
for my grandpa.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.359
Well, you need
to get Hummels

10:09.526 --> 10:11.278
without making Butters
a drug dealer.

10:11.445 --> 10:12.821
Drug dealer?!

10:12.988 --> 10:14.072
All right.
All right.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.533

Bring 'em in!

11:46.957 --> 11:47.708
Aah!

11:47.874 --> 11:49.209
Hello, Mr. Marsh.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.460
Oh, he-hey, Marcus.

11:50.627 --> 11:51.878
I understand you've become

11:52.045 --> 11:53.797
quite the Hummel collector
lately.

11:53.964 --> 11:56.717
What's the fascination
with Hummels?

11:56.883 --> 11:59.720
Nothing. I -- Look, I just
really like Hummels, okay?

11:59.886 --> 12:01.054
I'm just --
I'm really into Hummels.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.765
Ah. I see.
So then you should be able

12:03.932 --> 12:06.351
to tell me what
<i>this</i> Hummel is called.

12:06.518 --> 12:07.644
That -- That's, uh --

12:07.811 --> 12:08.687
Come on!
If you're a Hummel expert,

12:08.854 --> 12:10.230
then you should
know it's name!

12:10.397 --> 12:12.232
It's -- It's
Whistling in the Rain.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.943
Wrong!
It's called Stormy Weather.

12:15.110 --> 12:18.155
- Do you know where it was found?
- No.

12:18.321 --> 12:22.367
It was found deep in the anus
of one Chuck E. Cheese,

12:22.534 --> 12:24.453
the renowned entertainer
beloved by millions!

12:24.619 --> 12:26.872
If you know something
about the epidemic

12:27.038 --> 12:29.916
that is killing artists,
then you better cough it up.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.544
Marcus, trust me, you don't
want to get involved.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.671
I <i>became</i> involved
when Chuck E. Cheese

12:34.838 --> 12:37.799
collapsed like a rag doll
before my very eyes!

12:37.966 --> 12:41.803
If you had any involvement,
I will bring you down!

12:48.727 --> 12:50.687
Well, it was really great
seeing you, Dad.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.939
Guess we oughta
hit the road soon.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.317
You finally come to visit
and leave after 10 minutes.

12:55.484 --> 12:56.777
Oh, Jesus, now we know

12:56.943 --> 12:58.862
where Stan gets
his guilt trips from.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.363
Mmmm.

13:00.530 --> 13:03.909
It seems somebody's been
a little naughty lately.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.287
Oh, Mrs. McGullicutty,

13:07.454 --> 13:08.079
how are you?

13:08.246 --> 13:09.915
Mmmm.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.584
My, what a lovely
Hummel collection

13:12.751 --> 13:14.002
you're starting
to amass.

13:16.046 --> 13:20.509
Almost smells brand new,
doesn't it?

13:20.675 --> 13:23.303
Like it was purchased
right from the factory.

13:24.888 --> 13:28.767
Ooh, and who are
these lovely people?

13:28.934 --> 13:32.103
Family that came to visit,
no doubt?

13:32.270 --> 13:34.606
Yes.
Yeah, we love coming here.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.817
Ah, family.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.985
I remember
when I was a little girl.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.656
My brother used to play
such tricks on me.

13:42.823 --> 13:44.908
Try to fool me.

13:45.075 --> 13:48.286
Try to get out
from his responsibilities.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.955
I'm giving you Hummels.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.373
What's it matter
where they come from?

13:51.540 --> 13:53.166
Oh.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.795
It doesn't matter to <i>me,</i>
but it matters to them.

13:56.962 --> 13:59.214
The big guys.

13:59.381 --> 14:03.718
You see, what they want is
more people who are addicted.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.595
To crochet pillows.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.764
Got it?

14:07.931 --> 14:10.642
Nice to meet you fine folks.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.186
We're never
visiting here again.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.732
Oh, ho!
You're dead, Butters!

14:17.899 --> 14:19.359
Aw, geez.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.986
Guys!
Guys, I need your help!

14:21.152 --> 14:22.362
If it has to do
with your heroin operation,

14:22.529 --> 14:23.822
count us out.

14:23.989 --> 14:24.614
I just talked
to my grandpa.

14:24.781 --> 14:25.866
There's more
at work here

14:26.032 --> 14:27.492
than just old people
pushing pills.

14:27.659 --> 14:30.620
Stan, we told you
we don't want to be involved.

14:30.787 --> 14:31.788
The head bitch
of the nursing home

14:31.955 --> 14:33.081
is gonna take
my grandpa down --

14:33.248 --> 14:34.165
maybe my whole family!

14:34.332 --> 14:35.792
Get outta the way,
dude!

14:35.959 --> 14:37.669
But I know what to do!

14:37.836 --> 14:39.504
Whoever has the best Hummels
controls the nursing home.

14:39.671 --> 14:40.964
We gotta steal this lady's
Hummel collection

14:41.131 --> 14:42.674
and give it
to my grandpa.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.843
Dude, Stan, even
if we <i>wanted</i> to help you,

14:45.010 --> 14:46.887
which we don't,
there's no way

14:47.053 --> 14:48.221
we can sneak into
an old folks home,

14:48.388 --> 14:49.723
distract
all the old people,

14:49.890 --> 14:51.182
and take
an old lady's Hummels.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.476
Oh, wait, there totally is
a way you could do that.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.020
Yeah? What -- What is it,
Cartman?

14:55.186 --> 14:57.022
Dude, we're not
getting involved!

14:57.188 --> 14:58.773
Cartman, if you have an idea,
please tell me.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.108
I need you.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.402
I know how to distract
old people.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.237
Aw, shit.

15:06.740 --> 15:07.866
Yes?

15:08.033 --> 15:09.868
We're at
Mimi Thompson's party.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.745
Peppa Pig just collapsed
on stage!

15:11.912 --> 15:15.373
Oh, my God! Don't let anyone
near Peppa Pig until I arrive!

15:17.000 --> 15:18.668
Move aside!
Let me through!

15:18.835 --> 15:21.338
Aw, Peppa.
Peppa, can you hear me?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.509
My name is Marcus Preston.
Can you understand me?

15:26.676 --> 15:28.219
Where did you get
the drugs, Peppa?

15:28.386 --> 15:29.721
Was it from Stan Marsh?

15:29.888 --> 15:31.264
Yo, man,
what you talkin' 'bout?

15:31.431 --> 15:32.515
Get me
a fucking ambulance.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.267
Shh!
Peppa, focus.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.227
Soon you'll be
in Heaven,

15:36.394 --> 15:38.897
jumping in all the muddy puddles
you can imagine,

15:39.064 --> 15:41.691
but first,
you must tell me --

15:41.858 --> 15:44.444
Where do the Hummels go,
Peppa?

15:44.611 --> 15:46.446
All right, let us through.
Get away, kids.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.239
Peppa, now!
Why Hummels?

15:48.406 --> 15:49.532
You've got to squeal!

15:49.699 --> 15:51.868
Old people!

15:52.035 --> 15:54.829
Old people...
love Hummels.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.334
It's okay.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.920
She's with
Chuck E. Cheese now.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.178
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, hello.

16:10.345 --> 16:12.430
We are adorable children
here to entertain old people.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.224
Didn't think we had
anyone scheduled tonight.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.767
Are you with
the Protestant youth group?

16:15.934 --> 16:17.602
Yes, that's right.
We are young prostitutes

16:17.769 --> 16:18.770
here to volunteer
however we can.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.438
Fine.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.565
Round 'em up!
We got another kids choir!

16:22.732 --> 16:23.900
Come on!
Let's go!

16:24.067 --> 16:25.860
Children's choir
in the commons.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.321
- Aw, damn it.
- Shit.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.156
Darling children
are gonna sing for you.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.866
- Move your asses!
- Aw, not again!

16:32.033 --> 16:35.453
All right, seniors,
how are we feeling tonight?

16:35.620 --> 16:37.372
Our youth group has come
to lift your spirits

16:37.539 --> 16:39.582
with some songs to take you
down memory lane.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.669

I told you
I'd bring you down.

Marcus,
it's not what you think.

18:22.519 --> 18:23.770
I'm trying to make things
better here.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.230
Oh, I'll bet you are.

18:25.396 --> 18:27.357
You, your grandpa,
all the people here

You can put an end

stopping the problem!

18:33.613 --> 18:35.406
These people are
victims too, Marcus.

18:35.573 --> 18:36.741
Victims of
a way bigger game

18:36.908 --> 18:38.368

18:59.722 --> 19:01.224
That's why you have
to go further, Marcus.

19:01.391 --> 19:02.600
Take it to the people

19:02.767 --> 19:04.185
who profited
from Chuck E.'s addiction.

19:05.395 --> 19:08.481

19:30.587 --> 19:32.797
You kids
are absolutely awful.

19:36.801 --> 19:39.053
What the --
Someone is in my room!

19:43.141 --> 19:45.018
Whaaaaat?!

19:46.728 --> 19:48.855
Billy, what are you
doing here?

19:49.022 --> 19:50.023
Surprise, Grandpa.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.524
I got what you needed.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.943
Huh?

19:54.110 --> 19:55.695
Billy!

19:55.862 --> 19:57.614
Mrs. McGullicutty's
Hummel collection!

19:57.780 --> 19:58.865
You got it for me!

19:59.032 --> 20:00.700
Yeah, Grandpa.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.285
Now you can put a stop
to all this, right?

20:02.452 --> 20:05.330
Yeah.
I just might be able to.

20:10.084 --> 20:11.252
What are you doing,
Grandpa?

20:11.419 --> 20:12.837
I told you, Billy --

20:13.004 --> 20:16.007
These Hummels hold a special
power with old people.

20:16.174 --> 20:18.176
You!

20:18.343 --> 20:20.678
Go on,
get outta here.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.306
You really thought
stealing my Hummels

20:23.473 --> 20:25.808
will make YOU the head bitch
in this place?!

20:26.893 --> 20:28.603
Yeah,
I think it will.

20:31.147 --> 20:32.440
Ooh!

20:32.607 --> 20:33.316
Aah!

20:33.483 --> 20:34.275
Ohh!

20:36.277 --> 20:37.028
Ooh!

20:48.706 --> 20:52.252
Now you know how we do shit
in the nursing home.

20:53.461 --> 20:54.629
That's pretty sweet.

21:00.635 --> 21:02.762
You get your paws off of me,
young man!

21:04.138 --> 21:05.181
There, there,
Mrs. McGullicutty.

21:05.348 --> 21:06.224
Everything's
gonna be all right.

21:06.891 --> 21:09.394
No! Not Solitaire!

21:09.560 --> 21:13.356
I won't play it!
You can't make me!

21:13.523 --> 21:16.150
Congratulations on becoming
head bitch, Grandpa.

21:16.317 --> 21:17.527
Thank you, Billy.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.779
Now, if only
we could take down

21:19.946 --> 21:22.031
the real douche bags
who profit from all this.

21:22.198 --> 21:23.700
Aw, don't worry.

21:23.866 --> 21:24.701
I have a feeling
that's about to happen.

21:33.835 --> 21:35.878
Ladies and gentlemen...

21:36.045 --> 21:38.756
My name is Marcus Preston.

21:38.923 --> 21:42.051
I have some questions.
