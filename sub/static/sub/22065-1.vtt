Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:35.103 --> 00:36.670
Bullshit!

00:36.672 --> 00:38.071
No.

00:38.073 --> 00:40.108
Since when?

00:40.110 --> 00:42.679
Since 15 years ago.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.514
Bullshit.

00:45.516 --> 00:46.681
No, it's not.

00:46.683 --> 00:48.084
Where's your ring?

00:51.955 --> 00:54.087
Ha! I know a Cracker Jack prize

00:54.089 --> 00:56.090
when I see one. Where is he, then?

00:56.092 --> 00:57.827
He is in LA with a client right now.

00:57.829 --> 01:02.032
Okay, well, where's your
wedding-type snapshots

01:02.034 --> 01:05.467
and, you know, pretty photos
of you and this husband?

01:05.468 --> 01:07.770
We host a lot of parties here,

01:07.772 --> 01:10.106
and Grady thinks that personal
artifacts are tacky, so that's why...

01:10.108 --> 01:11.473
- G... Grady?
- Yes.

01:11.475 --> 01:13.175
His name is Grady? Come on.

01:13.177 --> 01:15.377
Yes... Yes, Stensland, his name is Grady.

01:18.148 --> 01:20.381
Bullshit! Ha! Nice try.

01:20.383 --> 01:23.051
Jesus, I can't believe you, Morgan.

01:23.053 --> 01:24.820
Where... Where are you going?

01:24.822 --> 01:27.156
To expose the lack of man
clothing in your closet

01:27.158 --> 01:28.592
and prove that you're bullshitting.

01:30.128 --> 01:31.628
What the fuck!

01:32.164 --> 01:34.166
I'm married!

01:35.800 --> 01:38.602
Tell me you don't have
kids. Were they watching us?

01:38.604 --> 01:40.903
No. I don't... Why would
I have my kids watching...

01:40.905 --> 01:42.572
I don't have any kids.

01:42.574 --> 01:44.039
You don't have kids because
he's a violent drunk.

01:44.041 --> 01:45.742
- No, we just...
- He'd beat them.

01:45.744 --> 01:47.343
Each other is all we've
ever really wanted or needed,

01:47.345 --> 01:49.612
so we don't have kids.

01:49.614 --> 01:54.052
"Was." So, you'll be separated soon, right?

01:54.054 --> 01:55.487
No.

01:56.989 --> 01:59.790
Then what the fuck is this?

01:59.792 --> 02:03.227
You held my hand in the cab yesterday!

02:03.229 --> 02:05.963
That isn't the action of a
woman just looking for great sex

02:05.965 --> 02:10.568
behind her hubby's back, that's a
woman looking for Doctor Zhivago!

02:10.571 --> 02:12.138
This...

02:15.510 --> 02:17.175
He cheated on me, okay?

02:17.177 --> 02:19.177
He cheated on you?

02:19.179 --> 02:23.116
And I held your hand yesterday
because I like you, Stensland.

02:23.118 --> 02:27.353
- Aw.
- You know, I'm still... I'm still crushable.

02:29.121 --> 02:30.689
"Crushable"?

02:30.691 --> 02:33.359
You can't even say the
word "love," can you?

02:35.095 --> 02:37.429
You know, you can... You
can free the penis now.

02:37.431 --> 02:39.430
I mean, I've seen you
naked for the past two days.

02:39.432 --> 02:42.868
You've been seeing me naked
under sheets and in limited light.

02:42.870 --> 02:45.272
I've got very wide hips that make my unit

02:45.274 --> 02:47.239
look a lot smaller than it actually is.

02:47.241 --> 02:48.942
So it's like an optical illusion?

02:48.944 --> 02:51.678
Yes! I've got bitch hips. Leave it be.

02:51.680 --> 02:54.713
Okay, listen. This was so much fun.

02:54.715 --> 02:56.582
And so, thank you.

02:56.584 --> 03:02.223
But this is the last time that we
will be seeing each other, okay?

03:03.492 --> 03:06.528
Good. I was testing you.

03:07.295 --> 03:09.095
Oh, phew!

03:09.097 --> 03:11.031
What a load off my mind.

03:11.033 --> 03:13.834
Oh, you know, my biggest fear,

03:13.836 --> 03:16.036
since we started hookin' up, baby,

03:16.038 --> 03:19.239
was that you would think this
was something more than fucking,

03:19.241 --> 03:21.441
like, God forbid, love.

03:21.443 --> 03:23.345
- Love, love, love.
- Listen, I...

03:23.347 --> 03:26.715
I didn't want to hurt
you. I'm really sorry.

03:26.717 --> 03:28.283
You're sorry?

03:30.753 --> 03:32.787
As for these...

03:32.789 --> 03:36.525
Something tells me they're
due for a dry cleaning.

03:36.527 --> 03:38.160
Oh... What are you doing?

03:38.162 --> 03:39.894
What is wrong with you?

03:39.896 --> 03:41.362
Good day, madam.

03:41.364 --> 03:43.898
Oh. Oh, that was real mature.

04:10.661 --> 04:11.763
What?

04:14.900 --> 04:16.399
"Crushable"?

04:18.338 --> 04:20.269
How dare she?

04:20.271 --> 04:21.704
All right, the usual.

04:21.706 --> 04:24.141
One pink scone, one strawberry milk.

04:24.143 --> 04:25.540
So $4.53.

04:27.078 --> 04:28.679
You, uh... You doing all right, Stensland?

04:31.348 --> 04:34.351
Could someone let me borrow 53 cents?

04:55.507 --> 04:57.075
Sweet Christ, not now.

04:57.077 --> 04:59.646
Woman, I don't know what you're saying!

04:59.648 --> 05:01.513
No, not a single decipherable word!

05:01.515 --> 05:04.251
It's the same puzzling dance every day!

05:05.220 --> 05:06.652
Shut up!

05:13.926 --> 05:17.162
You're not the smartest,
you're not the coolest,

05:17.164 --> 05:18.564
you're not the best-looking,

05:18.566 --> 05:21.466
but God damn it, you are something.

05:21.468 --> 05:24.103
You've got something that attracts people.

05:24.105 --> 05:27.741
You've got something
that attracts the ladies.

05:27.743 --> 05:30.209
They don't know what it is,
you don't know what it is,

05:30.211 --> 05:35.916
but it's there, cocooned,
growing and learning.

05:35.918 --> 05:39.687
And one day, you'll bloom
into a big, beautiful condor

05:39.689 --> 05:43.322
that people will respect and fear.

05:43.324 --> 05:47.962
"I can't believe that used
to be Stensland," they'll say.

05:47.964 --> 05:51.465
"I can't believe that
used to be Stensland."

06:14.523 --> 06:16.391
Hello, old friend.

06:23.701 --> 06:25.300
<i>Go ahead.</i>

06:25.302 --> 06:27.103
Oh, great episode.

06:27.105 --> 06:29.905
Stensland? Oh, you are here.

06:31.309 --> 06:32.507
Hey.

06:32.509 --> 06:33.673
Hey.

06:33.675 --> 06:35.712
Nah, I'm... I'm good.

06:35.714 --> 06:37.780
I thought you said you were going
to stop smoking during the day?

06:37.782 --> 06:40.048
Oh, look, my dead mom's back. Great.

06:40.050 --> 06:42.650
My God, what's the matter with you?

06:42.652 --> 06:45.222
Morgan dumped me, okay?

06:45.224 --> 06:47.522
She's married.

06:47.524 --> 06:49.659
Is that the older lady you
met at the furniture store?

06:49.661 --> 06:52.527
Don't make her sound like
Jessica Tandy. She's in her July.

06:52.529 --> 06:55.664
Whatever, man. At least
you got sex without strings.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.633
I want strings.

06:57.635 --> 07:00.504
I want commitment and mutual adoration.

07:00.506 --> 07:03.105
I want to pass the bong
to someone with boobs.

07:03.107 --> 07:05.675
I want the danger of
forgetting anniversaries

07:05.677 --> 07:07.278
and the pain of holding in farts

07:07.280 --> 07:08.811
because someone is sharing my bed.

07:08.813 --> 07:12.014
- I want a girlfriend, Lyle.
- I know, I know.

07:12.016 --> 07:13.785
I'm sorry to change the subject,

07:13.787 --> 07:16.353
but you noticed the cardboard boxes, right?

07:16.355 --> 07:17.821
Did you drink and eBay?

07:17.823 --> 07:20.458
No, I started moving over to Linda's.

07:20.460 --> 07:22.225
Already?

07:22.227 --> 07:24.361
You need to find another roommate, man.

07:24.363 --> 07:25.596
Is this mine?

07:25.598 --> 07:27.597
I like you.

07:27.599 --> 07:31.503
I like you, too, buddy, just
not as much as Linda. I love her.

07:31.505 --> 07:32.904
All right, well, I'm out of here

07:32.906 --> 07:34.906
a week from tomorrow, next Monday.

07:34.908 --> 07:38.241
So find another roommate, Stens.

07:38.243 --> 07:39.743
God damn it.

07:43.149 --> 07:45.583
<i>...life imitating
art imitating life?</i>

07:47.254 --> 07:51.624
<i>...and maybe, you know,
it's not part of the plan.</i>

07:51.626 --> 07:53.258
<i>Then again, I never thought that</i>

07:53.260 --> 07:56.061
<i>losing you was part
of the plan, either.</i>

07:56.063 --> 07:58.131
Oh...

07:58.133 --> 08:01.467
<i>I think sometimes you have
to lose somebody completely</i>

08:01.469 --> 08:04.203
<i>before you can figure out
what they really mean to you.</i>

08:05.573 --> 08:09.441
Oh, D-dog, laying down the truth.

08:09.443 --> 08:10.975
<i>Hi, it's me...</i>

08:10.977 --> 08:12.678
Oh, Jesus!

08:12.680 --> 08:14.180
Morgan, would you please call me back?

08:14.182 --> 08:16.884
I worry I'm beginning to look desperate.

08:16.886 --> 08:19.219
Phew! It smells bad in here.

08:19.221 --> 08:20.387
What are you doing?

08:20.389 --> 08:21.755
Oh...

08:21.757 --> 08:23.658
I'm, uh, relaxing.

08:24.393 --> 08:25.791
What about work?

08:25.793 --> 08:27.027
Oh, I'm on leave.

08:28.129 --> 08:29.695
You're not in the Navy.

08:29.697 --> 08:31.264
You work six-hour shifts
at an antique shop.

08:31.266 --> 08:33.097
- Why do you need a leave?
- My breakup!

08:33.100 --> 08:35.570
For Christ's sake, man.
Was the sex that good?

08:35.572 --> 08:38.139
Good? It was transcendent, Lyle.

08:38.140 --> 08:41.442
My spiritual self is
still making an O-face.

08:41.443 --> 08:42.976
But I'm not mourning the sex.

08:42.977 --> 08:44.979
I'm mourning what we might have been.

08:44.981 --> 08:48.083
That tiny taste of affection
has made it very evident to me

08:48.085 --> 08:50.316
that something's missing from my life.

08:50.318 --> 08:53.622
Okay. I'm just surprised the
store gave you this much time off.

08:53.624 --> 08:55.757
Well...

08:55.759 --> 08:59.594
This is more like one of those
self-allotted time-out leaves, you know?

08:59.596 --> 09:01.331
What? Go to work!

09:01.333 --> 09:03.431
Stensland! I'm going to be
totally moved out tomorrow.

09:03.433 --> 09:04.734
You said I had till Monday.

09:04.736 --> 09:06.500
Tomorrow is Monday, man.

09:06.502 --> 09:09.171
- Tomorrow's Monday?
- Tomorrow's Monday. Come on.

09:10.540 --> 09:13.810
Shit. This chiba is unforgiving.

09:52.951 --> 09:55.019
Ah, Mr. Laframboise.

09:55.021 --> 09:57.756
I was just mulling a
froYo break. You want one?

09:58.758 --> 10:00.424
This is the last check.

10:00.426 --> 10:03.862
You don't showing up one
week, no call, no nothing!

10:03.864 --> 10:07.463
Wait a minute, are we doing a
scene from <i>The Pawnbroker?</i>

10:07.465 --> 10:10.766
Mr. Laframboise, are you back
in acting class? That's great.

10:10.768 --> 10:13.103
- Get out!
- Oh, okay, all right.

10:13.105 --> 10:15.573
You're a passionate bear,
you're upset, I get it.

10:15.575 --> 10:18.343
I need to work on my
communication skills, that's clear.

10:18.345 --> 10:20.878
But I'm pretty sure I was
already due a vacation week,

10:20.880 --> 10:23.247
so can we just sit back, relax,

10:23.249 --> 10:24.816
I'll put on some jasmine tea, chill out...

10:24.818 --> 10:26.282
- Sir?
- What?

10:26.284 --> 10:28.619
I think this varnish may have turned,

10:28.621 --> 10:32.424
and I would hate to compromise the
honesty of that Victorian end table.

10:32.426 --> 10:34.060
Sorry, am I interrupting?

10:35.696 --> 10:37.096
Who the fuck is this?

10:37.098 --> 10:38.696
New Stensland.

10:38.698 --> 10:41.767
There's no other Stensland.
How could you say that?

10:41.769 --> 10:43.635
Um, my name is Pierce.

10:43.637 --> 10:46.806
Mr. Laframboise, your
assumption that my absence

10:46.808 --> 10:49.142
is barren of a logical
explanation offends me.

10:49.144 --> 10:51.744
- We're closer than this.
- No, we're not.

10:51.746 --> 10:53.779
Okay, look, here's what happened.

10:53.781 --> 10:57.115
I was sideswiped by a nasty
cyclone known as "woman."

10:57.117 --> 11:01.020
Lost aimlessly in her deceit,
and it stung like a biatch.

11:01.022 --> 11:04.926
So, please, just give me another chance.

11:05.694 --> 11:07.295
Fuck you!

11:19.540 --> 11:20.940
Morgan!

11:26.684 --> 11:28.215
Morgan!

11:28.217 --> 11:30.050
Hey! Hey, asshole! Come back here!

11:30.052 --> 11:32.052
- Morgan!
- You can't go in there.

11:32.054 --> 11:33.355
Morgan!

11:34.924 --> 11:36.255
Stensland.

11:36.257 --> 11:38.792
She remembers my name. Shocker.

11:38.794 --> 11:40.427
I'm calling security.

11:40.429 --> 11:42.029
No, no. No, it's okay.
No, it's okay. We're okay.

11:42.031 --> 11:43.465
You know this guy?

11:43.467 --> 11:45.699
Yeah, no, no. I'll handle it. It's okay.

11:45.701 --> 11:47.737
Moneypenny, could you order us
up some sandwiches and lemonade?

11:47.739 --> 11:49.137
This'll take a while.

11:49.139 --> 11:51.040
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it will.

11:51.042 --> 11:52.508
Thank you, Hannah.
Thanks, honey. I got this.

11:52.510 --> 11:55.142
Yeah, no, no, this is, um... Stensland.

11:55.144 --> 11:58.713
It's not a thing at all. It's just a, um...

11:58.715 --> 12:00.884
- Okay.
- Thanks, honey.

12:03.254 --> 12:04.953
- What do you want?
- "What do you want?"

12:04.955 --> 12:06.688
We made love a week ago.

12:06.690 --> 12:09.324
I'm no dildo you wipe off
and put back in the drawer.

12:09.326 --> 12:11.026
Why haven't you called me back?

12:11.028 --> 12:13.430
Because that was it.

12:13.432 --> 12:15.230
It was a one-time thing.

12:15.232 --> 12:17.233
I don't care if you're married, Morgan.

12:17.235 --> 12:19.570
- I still love you. You love me, it's just...
- What?

12:19.572 --> 12:21.405
What does that even mean?

12:21.407 --> 12:24.275
It means let's keep on keepin' on.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.742
Let's ride this naughty little secret.

12:26.744 --> 12:28.176
No.

12:28.178 --> 12:30.747
Why? Isn't he cheating on you, too?

12:31.682 --> 12:32.815
I don't know.

12:32.817 --> 12:33.882
Oh...

12:33.884 --> 12:35.721
Now you don't know!

12:42.560 --> 12:43.960
Is that him?

12:44.563 --> 12:46.565
Yes.

12:46.567 --> 12:48.431
He has a moustache?

12:48.433 --> 12:49.501
Yes.

12:53.372 --> 12:56.306
I want $15,000, or I'm gonna tell him.

12:56.308 --> 12:57.309
Mmm?

12:59.945 --> 13:01.780
I'm sorry.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.282
I'm sorry, you're... You're
gonna have to repeat that.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.216
What?

13:06.218 --> 13:09.587
I demand you pay me $15,000,

13:09.589 --> 13:13.191
or I'm gonna find Grady
and tell him everything.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.431
What the hell are you doing, Stens?

13:19.433 --> 13:22.601
"Stens," she says! Using the
abridged pet name to disarm me.

13:22.603 --> 13:24.437
- You're scared.
- Really?

13:24.439 --> 13:26.438
Grady's a criminal defense lawyer.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.808
I doubt he will believe
that I slept with you.

13:28.810 --> 13:30.043
Okay?

13:30.045 --> 13:31.778
Oh, he'll believe me, all right.

13:31.780 --> 13:35.048
Why? Did you record us or something?

13:35.050 --> 13:37.884
No, but I have evidence of passion.

13:37.886 --> 13:39.651
Remember this?

13:39.653 --> 13:43.054
"Kiss me between my
shoulder blades, Stensland."

13:43.056 --> 13:45.055
And remember this?

13:45.057 --> 13:48.494
"Rub my ass like this when you're
going down on me, Stensland."

13:48.496 --> 13:49.963
And what about this?

13:49.965 --> 13:51.631
Will this be evidence enough

13:51.633 --> 13:54.434
when I explain to Grady
in graphic, carnal detail

13:54.436 --> 13:58.104
that shaky little twitch
dance you do when you come?

13:58.106 --> 14:00.040
How does the chirp go?

14:07.951 --> 14:10.250
You don't get it, do you?

14:10.252 --> 14:11.185
What?

14:11.187 --> 14:13.056
I already told him.

14:13.890 --> 14:14.988
Bullshit.

14:14.990 --> 14:16.956
No, I did.

14:16.958 --> 14:19.894
You see, I was...

14:19.896 --> 14:22.363
I was looking for someone
to have an affair with,

14:22.365 --> 14:24.565
so I could throw it in his face

14:24.567 --> 14:28.201
to show him that I'm not
just gonna sit here and smile

14:28.203 --> 14:29.772
while he tunes out our marriage

14:29.774 --> 14:32.074
and does God knows what
he's doing out there.

14:32.076 --> 14:34.542
Mm-hmm, and, uh, what did he say?

14:34.544 --> 14:37.781
He said a lot of stuff
that's none of your business.

14:37.783 --> 14:39.615
But we're gonna work it out.

14:39.617 --> 14:43.252
- You're going to work it out?
- Yeah.

14:43.254 --> 14:46.687
Kid, I hate to crush your spirit here,

14:46.689 --> 14:49.058
but you're forcing me to.

14:50.427 --> 14:52.259
You're my pawn.

14:52.261 --> 14:56.097
You're like my little revenge marionette.

15:00.372 --> 15:03.074
You haven't told him
diddly squat, have you?

15:05.276 --> 15:07.009
Stensland holds all the cards.

15:07.011 --> 15:08.878
15 grand, sweetheart,

15:08.880 --> 15:11.813
or me and Grady are going
to sit down and talk turkey.

15:11.815 --> 15:13.282
Good day, madam.

15:14.152 --> 15:15.319
Oh, look!

15:16.887 --> 15:21.258
Uh-oh. The little pitcher has
big ears. <i>Yenta, yenta.</i>

15:22.294 --> 15:24.229
Who the fuck is that?

15:29.200 --> 15:31.834
- Hey.
- Are you all right?

15:31.836 --> 15:33.837
Yeah, no, I'm good. Um...

15:33.839 --> 15:36.807
How much of that did you hear?

15:36.809 --> 15:38.007
None of it.

15:38.009 --> 15:39.343
Oh, okay.

15:39.945 --> 15:41.044
A little.

15:42.181 --> 15:44.748
Okay, I heard everything.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.684
You slept with that guy?

15:46.686 --> 15:48.786
Oh, Hannah, I was in the
store, and I was depressed,

15:48.788 --> 15:52.290
and I was thinking about,
like, "Who the hell is Grady?"

15:52.292 --> 15:54.758
and, "Why the hell am I in the store?"

15:54.760 --> 15:56.828
And then this kid comes up

15:56.830 --> 16:00.999
and starts flirting with me like
I'm Princess Grace or something.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.935
Now I have a stalker.

16:02.937 --> 16:06.104
It's like, of course I sleep
with the one guy on the planet

16:06.106 --> 16:10.376
who's pissed off that his one-night
stand isn't just a one-night stand.

16:10.378 --> 16:12.912
Don't sweat it, okay?

16:12.914 --> 16:15.181
You already told Grady, so...

16:16.183 --> 16:18.517
- No.
- You haven't told Grady?

16:20.154 --> 16:21.989
Yeah, you're screwed.

16:29.164 --> 16:32.197
Balls of wonder, balls of might...

16:36.206 --> 16:38.172
<i>Law offices of Dott and Rosen.</i>

16:38.174 --> 16:40.407
Grady Dott, please.

16:40.409 --> 16:42.609
<i>I'm sorry, he's out of the office.
Would you like his voicemail?</i>

16:42.611 --> 16:44.345
No, no, no, patch me
through to his personal cell.

16:44.347 --> 16:45.812
This is an emergency.

16:45.814 --> 16:47.514
- <i>Your name?</i>
- Stensland.

16:47.516 --> 16:49.951
- <i>Please hold.</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

16:49.953 --> 16:52.653
<i>Mr. Stensland, what's
this concerning?</i>

16:52.655 --> 16:56.123
Uh, I fucked his wife many times?

16:56.125 --> 16:58.160
- <i>Please hold.</i>
- Uh-huh.

16:59.295 --> 17:01.929
Yeah, no baloney. Come on.

17:01.931 --> 17:03.597
<i>This is Grady Dott.</i>

17:03.599 --> 17:06.535
Mr. Dott, my name is Stensland.

17:06.537 --> 17:09.304
I'm a 29-year-old, unemployed
diamond in the rough

17:09.306 --> 17:11.305
with no foreseeable
opportunities for financial

17:11.307 --> 17:13.441
or personal success until my death.

17:13.443 --> 17:17.144
It's my sad duty to inform you that
I met your wife, Morgan, last week

17:17.146 --> 17:19.114
in Soft Solutions Fine Furnishings,

17:19.116 --> 17:21.781
whereupon she took me back to
your home and made love to me.

17:21.784 --> 17:23.886
At no point over the
weekend did she inform me

17:23.887 --> 17:25.520
that she was maritally
or otherwise spoken for...

17:25.521 --> 17:27.856
- <i>Stensland?</i>
- Yeah?

17:27.858 --> 17:29.759
<i>She told me.</i>

17:29.761 --> 17:31.595
Oh.

17:31.597 --> 17:35.130
<i>Now I'm going to find you,
and I'm going to kill you.</i>

17:54.819 --> 17:57.088
You need to find yourself
a girl your own age.

17:57.090 --> 18:00.156
One who hasn't already been
fucked up by some other asshole,

18:00.158 --> 18:04.359
so you can fuck her up your own
damn self, your own damn way.

18:04.361 --> 18:07.298
Ella, Internet dating has turned you cold.

18:07.300 --> 18:10.031
She's right. This Morgan's a mess.

18:10.033 --> 18:11.770
Stay sane, stay away.

18:11.772 --> 18:14.038
- Spend that love on a woman who wants it.
- Amen.

18:14.040 --> 18:15.473
That's right.

18:17.110 --> 18:18.975
Hit me with it straight, Denise.

18:18.977 --> 18:21.846
Coast is clear. No one's
outside your apartment, doll.

18:21.848 --> 18:24.580
Typical. That chump
ain't gonna fight for her.

18:24.582 --> 18:26.984
Ladies, let's get shit-faced.

18:53.014 --> 18:55.247
You've fucked your last wife, Stensland.

18:55.748 --> 18:57.382
Stensland?

18:57.384 --> 18:58.751
No, no, no. Sir, my name isn't Stensland.

18:58.753 --> 19:00.788
My name is Grady.

19:01.823 --> 19:02.957
Wrong.

19:02.959 --> 19:04.524
Oh, God!

19:04.526 --> 19:06.792
Don't! God...

19:13.102 --> 19:15.101
Oh, God...

19:15.103 --> 19:17.703
Hey, guy, the gun was
just to fuck with you.

19:17.705 --> 19:19.839
So you're not gonna kill me?

19:19.841 --> 19:22.341
No. My receptionist was listening
in when I threatened you,

19:22.343 --> 19:24.210
which means I'd have to kill her as well.

19:24.212 --> 19:26.947
And there's no way I'm
breaking in a new receptionist.

19:26.949 --> 19:28.914
No, sir.

19:28.916 --> 19:31.818
I am, however, going to kick
the ever-loving shit out of you.

19:33.288 --> 19:35.089
No, please...

19:35.091 --> 19:38.991
Please don't kick the
ever-loving shit out of me.

19:38.993 --> 19:40.294
What are you doing?

19:40.296 --> 19:42.028
I just... I bruise so easily.

19:42.030 --> 19:43.663
Come on.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.536
Huh...

19:47.538 --> 19:49.471
- Just don't...
- You've urinated in your shorts.

19:49.473 --> 19:52.741
Yes! You pointed a gun at my
face, and I already had to go.

19:52.743 --> 19:54.808
Jesus, Morgan!

19:54.810 --> 19:57.212
This is bullshit.

19:57.214 --> 19:58.514
She really knows how to pick 'em.

19:58.516 --> 20:00.114
She picked you to cheat with?

20:00.116 --> 20:02.584
Yes. Are you still
kicking the shit out of me?

20:02.586 --> 20:05.488
Yes, so just sit there and shut up.

20:09.326 --> 20:11.562
Jesus Christ, your apartment looks like

20:11.564 --> 20:13.797
the cargo hold of a pirate ship.

20:13.799 --> 20:14.931
Thank you.

20:14.933 --> 20:16.431
It's not a compliment, dumbass.

20:16.433 --> 20:18.468
This is literally a shit hole.

20:18.470 --> 20:20.036
It stinks.

20:20.038 --> 20:21.937
What is that, beef chow
mein from last week?

20:21.939 --> 20:24.440
And your bong water spilled everywhere?

20:24.442 --> 20:26.910
And now it smells like your cowardly urine.

20:26.912 --> 20:28.411
It smells like man.

20:28.413 --> 20:31.280
Don't call yourself that in front of me.

20:34.787 --> 20:36.318
Huh.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.587
I'll be damned.

20:38.589 --> 20:40.723
I didn't realize they still made those.

20:40.725 --> 20:43.459
"Shanty. Irish Mulligan Stew."

20:43.461 --> 20:45.128
Hey, don't rag it.

20:45.130 --> 20:47.865
That is a hearty bouillon
at an affordable price.

20:47.867 --> 20:49.700
I know what it is.

20:49.702 --> 20:52.201
It's all I ate when I was
poor and pathetic like you.

20:52.203 --> 20:54.905
Well, the tradition continues.

20:59.512 --> 21:00.945
What happened in your shorts?

21:01.581 --> 21:03.781
It's a twosie.

21:05.953 --> 21:07.686
Mmm, mmm.

21:08.954 --> 21:10.588
Mmm, that was good.

21:11.725 --> 21:13.458
Okay, so level with me.

21:13.460 --> 21:16.292
Did Morgan pay you to tell me you had sex?

21:16.294 --> 21:20.199
No. And I didn't know
she was married either.

21:20.201 --> 21:21.532
Yeah.

21:21.534 --> 21:25.203
Hey, why did you cheat on her?

21:25.205 --> 21:29.207
I didn't cheat on her. God...

21:29.209 --> 21:32.377
She picked up a scent of
perfume on one of my shirts,

21:32.379 --> 21:34.313
so that got her to thinking,

21:34.315 --> 21:36.581
and you know what happens when
vexed women start thinking.

21:36.583 --> 21:39.350
Civilizations fall, son.

21:39.352 --> 21:40.985
You can bank on that.

21:40.987 --> 21:43.254
So after a couple of
business trips ran long,

21:43.256 --> 21:47.394
the logical conclusion to her
irrational female intellect

21:47.396 --> 21:50.263
was that I was in fact cheating.

21:50.265 --> 21:51.732
Typical women.

21:51.734 --> 21:54.935
A brother can't even be late and tired.

21:56.505 --> 21:57.838
That's for sure.

21:57.840 --> 21:59.739
Oh, we give them our hearts,

21:59.741 --> 22:02.643
our penises, and still
they do not trust us.

22:06.081 --> 22:07.614
That was a good one.

22:07.616 --> 22:09.716
The old shower vomit.

22:09.718 --> 22:11.752
Yeah, I miss those days.

22:13.690 --> 22:15.555
Yeah, I mean, after 15 years of marriage,

22:15.557 --> 22:17.357
it's not so hot anymore.

22:17.359 --> 22:19.559
Do I get the urge to mess
around with other women?

22:19.561 --> 22:21.396
Of course I do.

22:21.398 --> 22:23.263
You can't control what goes
through this mastermind.

22:23.265 --> 22:25.432
No.

22:25.434 --> 22:28.270
That'd go against the very nature of
man, the very essence of evolution.

22:28.272 --> 22:31.272
When I get the desire to bang some strange,

22:31.274 --> 22:34.375
I just go find a quiet place, rub one out.

22:34.377 --> 22:36.712
Hence, desire quenched.

22:36.714 --> 22:38.848
Hey, you don't have to
tell me about quenches.

22:38.850 --> 22:41.852
I desire my quench all the fuckin' time.

22:42.686 --> 22:44.319
But you don't hate me?

22:44.321 --> 22:46.620
No, I don't hate you.

22:46.622 --> 22:48.524
Morgan's a beautiful woman.

22:49.558 --> 22:51.593
What are you gonna do?

22:51.595 --> 22:53.763
Ah, don't worry about me.

22:53.765 --> 22:55.599
Just get some rest.

23:40.278 --> 23:41.845
What the...

23:49.155 --> 23:53.624
Ah, there's the ol' lush, sleeping in.

23:55.663 --> 23:58.096
Oh, I hope you don't mind, I took
a couple of hits off the bong.

23:58.098 --> 24:01.765
I hadn't gotten high since The
Stones' "Bridges To Babylon" Tour.

24:01.767 --> 24:03.968
- Yeah.
- How do you like your eggs?

24:03.970 --> 24:05.102
Um...

24:05.104 --> 24:06.303
Scrambled?

24:06.305 --> 24:07.939
Scrambled it is.

24:07.941 --> 24:09.873
Four out of five American
men prefer scrambled.

24:09.875 --> 24:13.546
Over there in Europe,
they're all about the poach.

24:13.548 --> 24:15.816
Those guys are such pussies.

24:16.283 --> 24:17.682
Bacon?

24:17.684 --> 24:19.584
Uh, sure.

24:19.586 --> 24:22.055
I had bacon? And eggs?

24:22.057 --> 24:24.657
No. I went out and picked up a few things.

24:24.659 --> 24:26.692
Yeah, including some luggage.

24:26.694 --> 24:28.895
No, that was in the car.

24:30.263 --> 24:33.364
So, you left her.

24:33.366 --> 24:36.737
Temporarily. She'll
feel more guilt that way.

24:36.739 --> 24:38.739
Ooh! Ah...

24:38.741 --> 24:42.608
There she is. "Decline."

24:42.610 --> 24:45.979
Oh, you know what? I saw this
article on the refrigerator.

24:45.981 --> 24:50.015
Piqued my curiosity. "Men's
Life Crisis at Age 25."

24:50.017 --> 24:52.419
Yeah, that's what's wrong with me.

24:52.421 --> 24:55.454
There is now a life crisis
before the mid-life crisis

24:55.456 --> 24:59.126
that experts are calling
the "early-life crisis."

24:59.128 --> 25:00.627
Oh, that's clever.

25:00.629 --> 25:02.396
Yeah. I've been stuck in one of those.

25:02.398 --> 25:03.565
Yeah? For how long?

25:03.567 --> 25:05.199
Just over eight years.

25:05.201 --> 25:06.934
Close to a decade.

25:06.936 --> 25:09.237
I'm suffering from over-ambitious
aspirations for myself,

25:09.239 --> 25:12.139
so I worry about getting a better job,

25:12.141 --> 25:13.973
I desire a nicer place to live,

25:13.975 --> 25:16.810
and swankier clothes to
wear, and hotter girls.

25:16.812 --> 25:20.713
And I want to attain all of this
while I'm eradicating my debt.

25:20.715 --> 25:22.184
It's ridiculous.

25:22.186 --> 25:24.685
"Should adopt more realistic ambitions

25:24.687 --> 25:26.754
"to feel happier and less stress."

25:26.756 --> 25:28.357
That's easy for them to say.

25:28.359 --> 25:30.960
They have an awesome job at a magazine.

25:32.096 --> 25:33.229
Dickheads.

25:39.569 --> 25:41.003
I'm moving in here for a while.

25:42.206 --> 25:43.738
- What?
- Yeah.

25:43.740 --> 25:47.377
Morgan's faithlessness has emboldened me

25:47.379 --> 25:49.913
to take a vacation from her,

25:49.915 --> 25:53.214
from our marriage, from my career.

25:53.216 --> 25:55.484
Yeah. I want to spend it here.

25:55.486 --> 25:58.455
You said it looked like a pirate
ship and smelled of beef noodles.

25:58.457 --> 26:02.159
And you said it smelled
of man, and you were right.

26:02.826 --> 26:04.628
I... I was?

26:04.630 --> 26:06.830
Yes. What the fuck am I going to do?

26:06.832 --> 26:09.365
I'm going to lay around a swanky hotel

26:09.367 --> 26:13.138
swimming pool in a fluffy robe with
a slice of cucumber in my water?

26:13.140 --> 26:15.639
Order caviar-topped potatoes?

26:15.641 --> 26:17.439
Get massages?

26:17.441 --> 26:19.743
I started making a little
bit of money as a lawyer

26:19.745 --> 26:22.678
and turned into George Hamilton.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.380
I don't know who that is.

26:24.382 --> 26:28.217
Morgan is largely responsible
for me becoming fancy.

26:28.219 --> 26:32.290
The flat screen had to be
moved out of the bathroom.

26:32.292 --> 26:35.761
Can't eat any food anywhere
near the Italian bed linens.

26:35.763 --> 26:39.532
She's even got me wearing pink
Polo shirts on the weekend.

26:39.534 --> 26:40.965
Pink is sometimes nice.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.802
Yeah, it's nice on birthday cakes.

26:42.804 --> 26:46.571
But it doesn't belong on a
rough-riding son of a bitch like me.

26:46.573 --> 26:48.672
Or you!

26:48.674 --> 26:52.776
This whole man-shed experience has
brought me back to a blissful time

26:52.778 --> 26:54.845
when I was emotionally unformed

26:54.847 --> 26:59.017
and completely devoid of a
woman's redecorating tips.

26:59.019 --> 27:02.255
All I did in those days
was follow my pecker around.

27:02.257 --> 27:05.725
I didn't give a fuck
about anybody or anything.

27:05.727 --> 27:07.959
Here. What I need is here.

27:07.961 --> 27:10.062
I can do anything.

27:10.064 --> 27:12.863
I can freeball on this ugly couch.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.433
Don't say that.

27:14.435 --> 27:17.602
I can eat chili fries
in that filthy shower.

27:17.604 --> 27:22.709
I can binge-drink without
judgment anytime I want.

27:22.711 --> 27:26.680
I appreciate you making
my man-shed sound poetic,

27:26.682 --> 27:30.084
but why don't you just
get your own private flop?

27:30.086 --> 27:32.018
Why do you need to share with me?

27:32.020 --> 27:34.455
That's the genius part.

27:34.457 --> 27:39.862
This is the ice cream on top of
the pie, on top of the candy bar.

27:41.029 --> 27:42.397
You don't see it, do you?

27:43.465 --> 27:44.796
I don't.

27:44.798 --> 27:46.868
Morgan's fucked us both over, correct?

27:48.003 --> 27:49.603
Very correct.

27:49.605 --> 27:53.307
Do you know how batshit
crazy she is gonna go

27:53.309 --> 27:56.011
when she finds out that
we're living together?

27:57.114 --> 27:58.178
Ooh.

27:58.180 --> 27:59.914
I'm going to pay the rent.

27:59.916 --> 28:01.281
I'm gonna pay for utilities,

28:01.283 --> 28:04.117
groceries, weed, booze, whatever.

28:05.189 --> 28:07.489
I'm going to pay for everything.

28:09.425 --> 28:11.427
Rent's due on the first.

28:15.331 --> 28:18.132
<i>And the first variation
is to lean to one skate.</i>

28:19.337 --> 28:21.702
<i>This is a really good
stretch for your side.</i>

28:21.704 --> 28:25.441
<i>Okay, go ahead and come
up, square your shoulders.</i>

28:25.443 --> 28:27.976
<i>Try to reach for your other skate.</i>

28:29.212 --> 28:31.079
Shit, that's a cop knock.

28:31.081 --> 28:33.414
No, that's a Muumuu knock.

28:35.019 --> 28:37.086
Wait, this could be the weed talking,

28:37.088 --> 28:39.087
but there's a cow at the door?

28:39.089 --> 28:43.660
No, it's our indecipherable
landlord who only wears guess what?

28:43.662 --> 28:45.864
Sorry about the noise last night.

28:47.031 --> 28:48.398
She sounds sexy.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.766
Yeah, she's got charm for days.

28:50.768 --> 28:52.768
Lyle, my old roommate,

28:52.770 --> 28:55.872
he thinks she runs guns
out of the laundry room.

28:58.779 --> 29:02.078
- What are your plans for the rest of the day?
- Hmm...

29:02.080 --> 29:05.950
These leg lunges supersede any
plans I had for the rest of my life.

29:05.952 --> 29:08.050
<i>Lean into it.</i>

29:08.052 --> 29:09.988
<i>Don't forget to breathe.</i>

29:09.990 --> 29:12.390
You know where I've always
wanted to have lunch?

29:16.395 --> 29:18.127
How's it going with that hangover?

29:18.129 --> 29:19.998
I think it's getting worse.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.400
Well, damn it, boy, hit it
with another Engineer Beer.

29:23.402 --> 29:25.270
Or some of that Choo-Choo Chicken.

29:25.907 --> 29:27.471
Look at this.

29:27.473 --> 29:29.707
We had breakfast, like, an hour ago.

29:29.709 --> 29:32.043
Slow down. You're going to
give yourself a heart attack.

29:32.045 --> 29:33.912
Get used to my gluttony.

29:33.914 --> 29:37.015
I tend to eat a lot on vacation.

29:37.017 --> 29:40.351
Did... That... Did... What the fuck?

29:40.353 --> 29:43.755
That guy just took the last
of the Piggyback Potatoes!

29:43.757 --> 29:45.091
Shh.

29:45.625 --> 29:47.194
Shit.

29:47.196 --> 29:49.795
That's why I'm here.

29:49.797 --> 29:52.999
Oh, I am gonna have an excellent
bowel movement tomorrow.

29:53.001 --> 29:54.533
Guaranteed.

29:54.535 --> 29:56.936
So, what are your new aspirations

29:56.938 --> 29:59.938
now that the antiquities
industry has shit-canned you?

29:59.940 --> 30:03.708
Okay, um...

30:03.710 --> 30:06.311
To own my own company that
makes me a lot of money.

30:06.313 --> 30:08.580
What that company does,
I'm not really sure yet.

30:08.582 --> 30:11.552
I'd like a vintage Cadillac
with original leather interior.

30:11.554 --> 30:14.354
House on the water. Winter
home in the Virgin Islands.

30:14.356 --> 30:17.058
I'd like a wife, hot, preferably Asian...

30:17.060 --> 30:19.458
- I'm gonna stop you there.
- Yeah?

30:19.460 --> 30:22.462
I'm gonna recommend that you
adopt more realistic ambitions

30:22.464 --> 30:25.931
because it sounds like you're
a bit of an unrealistic dreamer.

30:25.933 --> 30:27.167
Guilty.

30:27.169 --> 30:28.400
I'm Pisces, so I view the world

30:28.402 --> 30:30.602
through rose-tinted spectacles.

30:30.604 --> 30:33.340
Oh, that stung all the
way to my brain stem.

30:33.342 --> 30:34.941
You gotta be kidding me.

30:34.943 --> 30:36.977
If you want to pick up a girl,

30:36.979 --> 30:39.147
you gotta infuse your vocab with
a little bit more testosterone.

30:39.149 --> 30:42.249
Words like "tits" and "big tits."

30:42.251 --> 30:45.152
Listen, Cadillacs and beach houses,

30:45.154 --> 30:48.623
those are the dreams
of stupid, naive people.

30:49.593 --> 30:51.026
That's not you, right?

30:53.796 --> 30:54.894
Grady?

30:54.896 --> 30:56.697
Yeah.

30:56.699 --> 30:59.468
They put out more Piggyback Potatoes.

30:59.470 --> 31:00.937
What?

31:00.939 --> 31:02.670
When?

31:02.672 --> 31:04.706
I find it a little strange, actually,

31:04.708 --> 31:07.442
that you blame "extreme muff deficiency"

31:07.444 --> 31:09.311
as the root of my problems,

31:09.313 --> 31:12.582
when the last muff I was
in belonged to your wife.

31:13.852 --> 31:15.351
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

31:15.353 --> 31:17.118
Let me ask you a question.

31:17.120 --> 31:20.656
If a fat guy diets, exercises,

31:20.658 --> 31:23.325
takes vitamins two weeks out of the year,

31:23.327 --> 31:27.162
does that necessarily
make him a healthy person?

31:27.164 --> 31:28.963
I get your point.

31:28.965 --> 31:31.066
So how come you're not
out there closing some ass?

31:31.068 --> 31:35.138
How? Where? I hate going
out. I hate going to bars.

31:35.140 --> 31:37.105
The music's always so loud.

31:37.107 --> 31:38.708
I can barely hear myself speak,

31:38.710 --> 31:40.642
let alone the lady I'm
trying to connect with.

31:40.644 --> 31:42.912
So it becomes this choreographed routine

31:42.914 --> 31:46.017
of two people just leaning into
each other all night, saying, "What?

31:46.019 --> 31:48.085
"What? What? What?"

31:48.087 --> 31:49.585
Well, that's your problem.

31:49.587 --> 31:51.589
Bars are not made for talking.

31:51.591 --> 31:53.691
That's why the music is so loud.

31:53.693 --> 31:55.959
You only need to be
concerned about two questions,

31:55.961 --> 31:59.530
"What are you drinking?"
and, "Where are we humping?"

32:01.567 --> 32:03.902
Could you see that on a
T-shirt? I just made that up.

32:03.904 --> 32:07.405
Unfortunately, yes, I
can see that on a T-shirt.

32:08.307 --> 32:10.007
Are you okay to drive?

32:10.009 --> 32:11.877
No. Definitely not. Get in.

32:13.580 --> 32:17.849
<i>What if you woke up
and you were 15 again?</i>

32:17.851 --> 32:22.654
<i>The funny thing is, I don't
feel that way anymore.</i>

32:22.656 --> 32:26.959
Oh... That was a delightful bubble bath.

32:26.961 --> 32:28.260
Whose Mr. Bubble is this?

32:28.262 --> 32:30.729
Who else lives here apart from you?

32:30.731 --> 32:33.065
I thought it might've
been your old roommate's.

32:33.067 --> 32:35.769
No, when people move out,
they bring their Mr. Bubble.

32:35.771 --> 32:37.403
That's how it works.

32:37.405 --> 32:39.606
Oh, well, you're out of Mr. Bubble.

32:39.608 --> 32:41.072
What?

32:41.074 --> 32:42.841
Jesus Christ, that was a new bottle.

32:42.843 --> 32:45.979
You're only supposed to
use a capful. A capful!

32:45.981 --> 32:49.550
It really smelled good, so
I just kept pouring it in.

32:50.819 --> 32:52.485
What are you watching?

32:52.487 --> 32:55.022
Ah. It's <i>Dawson's Creek.</i>

32:56.823 --> 32:58.826
Is this VHS?

32:58.828 --> 33:02.763
Yup. I have every episode recorded
on their original air date.

33:02.765 --> 33:05.232
I got them on eBay from
this woman in Delaware.

33:05.234 --> 33:09.070
She sent them in this awesome
casket she made, too. Look.

33:10.205 --> 33:12.039
Seriously, what is this show about?

33:12.041 --> 33:13.673
It's about an ambitious young man

33:13.675 --> 33:15.909
named Dawson Leery and his friends

33:15.911 --> 33:19.646
as they learn all about love and
life in Capeside, Massachusetts.

33:19.648 --> 33:22.951
Romantic entanglements and
growing pains are aplenty.

33:22.953 --> 33:25.054
You are going to love it.

33:28.324 --> 33:31.859
That sounds like the worst
fucking TV show I've ever heard of.

33:31.861 --> 33:32.993
- No.
- Yeah.

33:32.995 --> 33:34.830
We're not watching this.

33:34.832 --> 33:38.633
Come on, find a sporting event
or something with car crashes.

33:38.635 --> 33:40.601
Do you bite off Morgan's head like this

33:40.603 --> 33:42.270
every time she wants to watch
her favorite programming?

33:42.272 --> 33:44.340
We don't watch television together.

33:44.909 --> 33:46.610
- Never?
- No.

33:47.777 --> 33:49.612
I always thought the best part of marriage

33:49.614 --> 33:51.246
would be settling in every night

33:51.248 --> 33:53.449
to watch television with your life partner.

33:53.451 --> 33:56.385
You know, making fun of
the weatherman's hair,

33:56.387 --> 33:59.356
shouting out answers
during <i>Family Feud.</i>

34:00.189 --> 34:01.889
Not even <i>Top Chef?</i>

34:01.891 --> 34:05.726
No, not even <i>Top Chef,</i>
whatever the fuck that is.

34:05.728 --> 34:08.496
We have jobs, and we work most nights.

34:09.299 --> 34:10.800
That's sad.

34:10.802 --> 34:12.235
What would you know about it, Stensland?

34:14.237 --> 34:17.873
Get me the Doritos and a tumbler of Scotch.

34:17.876 --> 34:20.311
Come on, come on, come on.

34:20.313 --> 34:22.110
We don't have tumblers.

34:22.112 --> 34:23.679
I'll put it in a jelly jar.

34:23.681 --> 34:25.280
You don't have jelly jars either.

34:25.282 --> 34:27.150
I threw them all out this morning.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.016
God damn it.

34:31.023 --> 34:33.255
Hey, that's a Muumuu knock. You
want me to grab that, roomie?

34:33.257 --> 34:34.960
No, I'll get it.

34:34.962 --> 34:37.928
Sorry, we'll keep the fucking noise...

34:37.929 --> 34:39.897
Good, you're alive.

34:39.899 --> 34:41.931
What are you...

34:41.933 --> 34:43.935
Grady said he was coming over
here to kill you last night, so...

34:43.937 --> 34:45.536
You were worried about me.

34:45.538 --> 34:48.406
No, I was worried about
instigating a murder.

34:48.942 --> 34:50.875
Good night.

34:50.877 --> 34:54.679
Hey, Stens! I'm very high,
and I cannot feel my feet.

34:58.485 --> 35:00.487
- Grady!
- Oh, shit!

35:01.621 --> 35:04.121
Whoa, what are you doing here, man?

35:04.123 --> 35:07.425
Um, you said you were going to
come here and kill him last night.

35:07.427 --> 35:09.093
She was worried about me.

35:09.095 --> 35:11.563
I was not worried about you, okay?

35:12.400 --> 35:14.066
What are you doing here?

35:14.068 --> 35:16.101
I thought you checked into
the Sorrento last night.

35:16.103 --> 35:19.172
Nope. Nope, I live here now, woman.

35:19.673 --> 35:20.773
What?

35:22.611 --> 35:25.846
That's a joke, right?

35:25.848 --> 35:27.781
No.

35:27.783 --> 35:29.649
Stensland and I have bonded
over the mutual hatred of you.

35:29.651 --> 35:31.783
Oh, well, "Hatred" is a strong word.

35:31.785 --> 35:33.652
See, unlike you and your sisterhood

35:33.654 --> 35:35.721
of catty, hair-pulling harpies,

35:35.723 --> 35:38.959
men can move past their
mistakes and form a fellowship.

35:38.961 --> 35:41.928
A creed, if you will.
That's why we run the world.

35:41.930 --> 35:45.564
Oh, and what an honorable job you
frat dickheads are doing, thank you.

35:45.566 --> 35:47.501
Morgan, I don't hate you, per se.

35:47.503 --> 35:49.769
- I'm just very upset...
- Wait a second. Wait a second.

35:49.771 --> 35:52.371
You said she lied to
you and broke your heart,

35:52.373 --> 35:53.940
and you're going to stand over there

35:53.942 --> 35:55.708
and kiss her ass like
you owe her something.

35:55.710 --> 35:58.012
- Shut up.
- Grow some balls, Stensland.

35:58.014 --> 35:59.114
Stop it, Grady!

35:59.116 --> 36:00.681
- Fucking do it!
- Fine!

36:00.683 --> 36:03.416
Morgan, I'm really fucking pissed at you!

36:03.418 --> 36:06.219
You're very pretty, but you're a liar!

36:06.221 --> 36:08.289
Get a load of this, sister.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.892
Me and this fella right here,
we're taking a long Morgan vacation,

36:10.894 --> 36:12.560
and if you don't like that,
then you can just head out

36:12.562 --> 36:15.263
and find yourself another boy toy!

36:15.265 --> 36:17.365
Yeah. High-five that shit.

36:18.568 --> 36:21.569
Oh, this is so twisted, even for you.

36:21.571 --> 36:23.406
- Is it?
- Okay, you know what?

36:23.408 --> 36:25.741
Just so you know, it's not lost on me

36:25.743 --> 36:28.475
how insulting this must be for you

36:28.477 --> 36:31.211
that I cheated on you
with this child over here.

36:31.213 --> 36:32.982
Don't mind me, Morgan, I'm
just standing right here.

36:32.984 --> 36:34.583
- Will you just shut up?
- All right.

36:34.585 --> 36:36.920
- Please? Just shut...
- Sorry. Yeah.

36:36.922 --> 36:38.654
- I'll stop talking right now.
- You talk too much.

36:38.656 --> 36:40.323
- Okay.
- Stop.

36:41.793 --> 36:44.561
What was my next move
supposed to be, Grady?

36:44.563 --> 36:46.193
I told you that we were losing touch,

36:46.195 --> 36:49.297
that I needed more from
you, and you ignored me.

36:49.299 --> 36:52.668
You blew off therapy, you
drifted further away from me.

36:52.670 --> 36:55.971
I mean, what is someone supposed
to do when they're wandering around

36:55.973 --> 37:00.410
in the emotional equivalent
of the Atacama Desert, huh?

37:00.412 --> 37:04.615
Or starving for affection like
some Brazilian street orphan?

37:08.220 --> 37:10.387
Is this BBC World News?

37:11.789 --> 37:13.858
Oh, Jesus, fuck you. Just fuck you.

37:15.327 --> 37:17.894
This is our marriage, Grady.

37:17.896 --> 37:20.164
We need to sit down, and
we need to talk, okay?

37:20.166 --> 37:21.697
But I am not doing it here.

37:21.699 --> 37:24.435
So please go get your stuff, and let's go.

37:25.672 --> 37:26.773
No.

37:29.810 --> 37:31.042
Sorry.

37:31.044 --> 37:32.775
I'm going to stay here with Stensland

37:32.777 --> 37:34.513
and watch an episode of
<i>Darren's Stream.</i>

37:34.515 --> 37:36.482
That'd be <i>Dawson's Creek.</i>

37:42.087 --> 37:43.521
You do that.

37:50.097 --> 37:53.332
Jesus. What's with her cheap shots?

37:53.334 --> 37:54.999
Aw, forget it.

37:55.001 --> 37:57.369
You told her off like a
man. Didn't that feel good?

37:57.371 --> 37:59.470
No, it exhausted me.

37:59.472 --> 38:01.204
I'm going to go to bed for a few days.

38:01.206 --> 38:03.209
What are you talking
about? It's not even 10:00.

38:03.211 --> 38:05.678
I mean, the pubs are
crawling with young bug.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.711
We've got to get out there,
we've got to get some.

38:07.713 --> 38:10.216
I've got to cash in a
"bang some strange" card.

38:10.218 --> 38:11.551
- No.
- Yes.

38:11.553 --> 38:13.386
- No.
- Oh, yes. Come on.

38:13.388 --> 38:14.953
Stensland says no!

38:14.955 --> 38:16.690
Two double Black Labels
on the rocks, please.

38:16.692 --> 38:18.527
- You got it.
- Thank you.

38:19.326 --> 38:21.094
First prospect on the board.

38:21.096 --> 38:24.163
Bartenders flirt for tips,
they can't be prospects.

38:24.165 --> 38:26.100
Oh, come on.

38:26.102 --> 38:28.502
Dogs beg for Milk-Bones, but
they still wanna hump your leg.

38:29.605 --> 38:31.504
Now then, in scouting for a prospect,

38:31.506 --> 38:33.105
you've got to take in the whole field.

38:33.107 --> 38:35.008
You know what a baseball scout is, right?

38:35.010 --> 38:36.675
I'm Irish, not Amish.

38:36.677 --> 38:39.613
Good. That's good. I knew
you'd be good at this.

38:39.615 --> 38:41.115
- There you go, boys.
- Thank you.

38:41.117 --> 38:43.720
- Keep that tab wide open.
- Giddyup.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.354
See?

38:48.724 --> 38:50.425
Tonight we're muff scouts.

38:50.427 --> 38:52.793
I know, it lacks wit, but it's real.

38:52.795 --> 38:55.195
So, when we're scouting
quail, what are we looking for?

38:55.197 --> 38:56.530
Body, face, what else?

38:56.532 --> 38:58.968
Intelligence, sense of self, fashion.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.868
No! That's the pink part of your brain

39:00.870 --> 39:02.738
that allows you to enjoy
<i>Dawson's Creek.</i>

39:02.740 --> 39:05.006
The end game is to get 'em nude,

39:05.008 --> 39:08.142
<i>sans</i> fashion,
so it's never a factor.

39:08.144 --> 39:11.513
But what is a factor is personality.

39:11.515 --> 39:14.147
And it's as easy to spot as a panty line.

39:14.149 --> 39:17.018
Are they laughing? Are they smiling?

39:17.020 --> 39:18.754
Are they giving off any indication

39:18.756 --> 39:20.455
that they're having a good time,

39:20.457 --> 39:24.793
or that they're eager to
have a good time with you?

39:24.795 --> 39:28.295
Many of them are going to be
wearing this precious little smile

39:28.297 --> 39:34.637
that says, "Hey, please,
please come talk to me."

39:34.639 --> 39:37.639
I know that little smile.

39:37.641 --> 39:40.510
Of course you do, you fuckin' animal.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.677
That's why they're drinking here

39:42.679 --> 39:47.017
and not at home alone
with their kitty cats.

39:47.019 --> 39:50.386
Now then, survey the showroom,

39:50.388 --> 39:55.225
pick out a model, take her for a sex drive.

39:55.227 --> 39:57.026
And for the sake of Christ,

39:57.028 --> 39:59.429
keep drinking the rocket sauce.

40:32.431 --> 40:34.832
- Hey!
- Hey.

40:34.834 --> 40:36.736
What kind of drink is that?

40:36.738 --> 40:38.638
It's a Harlem Mugger.

40:39.539 --> 40:40.640
What?

40:40.642 --> 40:42.506
A Harlem Mugger!

40:42.508 --> 40:45.977
Oh! What's in it? Racism?

40:45.979 --> 40:50.716
No, no, it's got vodka, gin,
white rum, tequila, champagne,

40:50.718 --> 40:52.452
and a little cranberry juice.

40:52.454 --> 40:53.819
Always gets me shitfaced.

40:53.821 --> 40:55.854
Oh, my God.

40:55.856 --> 40:57.657
What's a lovely girl like you doing

40:57.659 --> 40:59.458
with a horrible drink like that?

40:59.460 --> 41:01.161
Are you a bootlegger?

41:01.163 --> 41:03.197
No, no.

41:03.199 --> 41:05.732
I ordered it because it smells
just like this anti-fungal shampoo

41:05.734 --> 41:07.701
I used to wash my pony with.

41:07.703 --> 41:08.902
Oh, is that right?

41:08.904 --> 41:10.938
Yeah, Gingerbelle.

41:10.940 --> 41:13.840
I couldn't decide between the
names Gingerbread and Clarabelle,

41:13.842 --> 41:15.541
so I combined them. Gingerbelle!

41:15.543 --> 41:18.244
- That's interesting.
- I loved her so much.

41:18.246 --> 41:22.216
Aw, Gingerbelle had this fungal
skin infection called "rain rot"

41:22.218 --> 41:25.452
and on warm nights, I used to
snuggle up with her in the barn,

41:25.454 --> 41:28.689
and then the bacteria from
her infection spread onto me.

41:28.691 --> 41:30.457
I still can't grow hair

41:30.459 --> 41:31.492
in my left armpit or half
my pubic region, but...

41:31.494 --> 41:33.059
Bye.

41:34.930 --> 41:36.398
Bye!

41:36.400 --> 41:39.767
So the guy goes, "Hey, who
put the baby in the dryer?"

41:39.769 --> 41:41.234
Excuse me, miss?

41:41.236 --> 41:43.537
Oh, man. Be right back.

41:43.539 --> 41:45.006
What are you doing here?

41:45.008 --> 41:46.875
Ugh, it's not gonna happen.

41:46.877 --> 41:49.610
I got talking to a girl,
but she was into animals.

41:49.612 --> 41:51.114
Really?

41:51.116 --> 41:52.080
Not like that.

41:52.082 --> 41:54.350
Before I even got her name,

41:54.352 --> 41:56.551
she tells me about this pony she
caught a bacterial infection from.

41:56.553 --> 41:58.821
Yeah, that's rain rot.

41:58.823 --> 42:00.154
How do you know that?

42:00.156 --> 42:01.790
I was in 4-H when I was a kid.

42:01.792 --> 42:03.891
Look, it's nothing. It just makes you shed.

42:03.893 --> 42:05.792
It's no big deal.

42:05.794 --> 42:08.362
Go back out there and just
casually bring up your penis.

42:08.364 --> 42:10.265
This is pathetic.

42:10.267 --> 42:12.168
You do realize there's not a lady here

42:12.170 --> 42:14.003
who can hold a candle to your wife, right?

42:14.005 --> 42:17.875
Stensland! Don't bring her up again.

42:19.275 --> 42:20.876
Get away from me.

42:27.186 --> 42:29.084
- Everything okay here?
- Yeah.

42:29.086 --> 42:31.419
Can I get another double, please?

42:31.421 --> 42:35.458
Oh. And a shot of tequila.

42:35.460 --> 42:39.328
The shittiest, cheapest
tequila that you have.

42:56.316 --> 42:57.750
Hi.

43:00.054 --> 43:01.621
Hi.

43:02.956 --> 43:06.224
Can you get the fuck up
and off my $700 jacket?

43:06.626 --> 43:07.927
Oh.

43:08.728 --> 43:10.161
I'm sorry.

43:11.597 --> 43:13.463
- Just give it!
- Sorry.

43:13.465 --> 43:15.798
Just watch where the fuck
you sit next time, dick face.

43:15.800 --> 43:17.834
"Dick face"? Jesus Christ.

43:17.836 --> 43:21.808
Why don't you tell your whore to
watch where she drops her shit?

43:23.477 --> 43:24.910
Oh.

43:24.912 --> 43:26.979
No, I didn't say that, he said that.

43:26.981 --> 43:29.114
- No. No, I didn't.
- What?

43:29.116 --> 43:31.417
Listen, drink this, 'cause you're
gonna need it in about five minutes.

43:31.419 --> 43:33.285
Who'd you call a whore, motherfucker?

43:33.287 --> 43:35.721
I believe he's referring to her,

43:35.723 --> 43:38.223
and, uh, he also bet me a fish taco

43:38.225 --> 43:40.359
that he'd have her blowing him

43:40.361 --> 43:42.028
- in the men's room by last call.
- What the fuck are you doing?

43:42.030 --> 43:43.763
That is confidence.

43:43.765 --> 43:45.931
- Oh, fuck! Okay.
- Outside, right now.

43:45.933 --> 43:47.666
- Bitch.
- "Bitch"?

43:47.668 --> 43:50.235
- Bitch.
- "Bitch"? Jesus.

43:50.237 --> 43:52.105
Don't ever bring up a man's wife

43:52.107 --> 43:54.173
when you're on bush patrol with him, okay?

43:54.175 --> 43:55.742
You couldn't deal with a pony snuggler,

43:55.744 --> 43:56.943
and you dragged me down with you,

43:56.945 --> 43:58.744
and that has consequences.

43:58.746 --> 44:01.114
Consequences that apparently
mean my death, asshole!

44:01.116 --> 44:03.516
- Thanks a bunch!
- You're welcome.

44:03.518 --> 44:04.751
God damn it!

44:04.753 --> 44:06.786
Let's do this, pussy!

44:06.788 --> 44:08.355
I can't believe you did this.
He's gonna put me in the hospital.

44:08.357 --> 44:10.024
You know what, you pissed me off,

44:10.026 --> 44:11.792
but now I feel a little shitty about it

44:11.794 --> 44:12.959
because that fucking guy's huge.

44:12.961 --> 44:14.995
He's a giant.

44:14.997 --> 44:16.865
Do you know what? Aside from all
that, you need this, Stensland.

44:16.867 --> 44:18.298
- Oh, I need this?
- Yes.

44:18.300 --> 44:20.667
Violence is good for a guy.

44:20.669 --> 44:22.970
It'll cure you of the desire to watch
<i>Dawson's Creek</i> every day. Right?

44:24.439 --> 44:25.906
Hey, it's an award-winner! Best Drama,

44:25.908 --> 44:27.874
Teen Choice Awards! Twice!

44:27.876 --> 44:29.510
Use that anger.

44:29.512 --> 44:31.011
You've been bullied your
whole life, Stensland.

44:31.013 --> 44:33.115
Do something about it.

44:33.117 --> 44:35.616
Put every prick's face that you
ever dealt with on that prick's face.

44:35.618 --> 44:37.886
- You just shut up and leave me alone.
- Good.

44:37.888 --> 44:39.987
Let do this, punk!

44:39.989 --> 44:41.588
- Fuck!
- Nice shot.

44:41.590 --> 44:43.991
All right. Proceed.

44:45.130 --> 44:47.163
This will all end very soon.

44:47.165 --> 44:49.063
Come on, Stens.

44:49.065 --> 44:51.766
Hey, freshman dork.
Look at those bitch hips!

44:51.768 --> 44:53.768
Make good handles for your boyfriend, huh?

44:53.770 --> 44:55.203
Oh!

44:55.205 --> 44:57.038
Keep 'em up. Get 'em up.

44:57.040 --> 44:59.374
You either get giddy about
the antique furniture,

44:59.376 --> 45:01.510
or get giddy in the unemployment line.

45:01.512 --> 45:04.513
Come on, Stensy.

45:04.515 --> 45:06.749
You're a child, Stensland.

45:06.751 --> 45:08.151
A mistake.

45:08.153 --> 45:10.754
I could never be your girlfriend.

45:19.764 --> 45:21.431
- Keep fighting!
- I did it!

45:25.004 --> 45:26.806
<i>Stensy?</i>

45:29.174 --> 45:30.942
Stensland!

45:33.245 --> 45:34.478
Mmm...

45:35.480 --> 45:37.180
Hello, dolly.

45:38.417 --> 45:40.951
Why do I have Wilford Brimley's mustache?

45:40.953 --> 45:43.187
Stensland, you punched me in the face.

45:43.189 --> 45:46.492
You felt that? I thought
it was only pretend.

45:51.764 --> 45:53.365
Whoa.

45:53.367 --> 45:55.434
What's your assistant
doing in the Swiss Alps?

45:55.436 --> 45:57.535
Care for a schmoke, Stensland?

45:57.537 --> 46:01.006
Man, she's wearing the shit
out of those <i>Hosen.</i>

46:01.008 --> 46:03.207
Come, Stensland. <i>Ja,</i> is good.

46:03.209 --> 46:05.642
Schmoke-ity,
schmoke-ity, schmoke-ity.

46:05.644 --> 46:08.178
- Hmm.
- <i>Ja,</i> is good.

46:12.520 --> 46:14.522
I wanted a schmoke.

46:34.208 --> 46:37.411
Grady, you piece of shit.

46:39.615 --> 46:42.449
And for some reason, she had two goats.

46:44.954 --> 46:47.052
You're drooling jam.

46:47.054 --> 46:49.922
Okay. Okay.

46:51.594 --> 46:53.860
So, we lived together for three years,

46:53.862 --> 46:56.496
and by far the most scandalous
thing I ever saw you do was

46:56.498 --> 46:58.799
roll the dice on some expired pudding cups

46:58.801 --> 47:00.602
you found in the back of the fridge.

47:00.604 --> 47:02.638
- A gamble I lost, if you remember.
- I do.

47:02.640 --> 47:05.040
Yet, in the 48 hours since I moved out,

47:05.042 --> 47:06.973
you blackmailed your mistress,

47:06.975 --> 47:08.477
you had a gun stuck in your face,

47:08.479 --> 47:10.511
you let your mistress's husband move in,

47:10.513 --> 47:13.413
and you fist-fought a man
twice your size in an alley?

47:13.415 --> 47:15.181
Yes.

47:15.183 --> 47:17.584
Why didn't you unleash any of
this radness when I was there?

47:17.586 --> 47:19.555
None of this is radness, Lyle.

47:19.557 --> 47:21.791
I need this guy out of my place.

47:21.793 --> 47:23.992
No, it's all radness, man.
Adventure is erupting all around you.

47:23.994 --> 47:27.396
- And I'm hating it.
- No. No, you don't realize you're loving it.

47:27.398 --> 47:29.230
Soldiers go to war, and they hate it,

47:29.232 --> 47:30.965
yet it's all they talk
about when they get back.

47:30.967 --> 47:32.802
I'm a prematurely old man who wants

47:32.804 --> 47:34.903
nothing more than a
comfortable place to sit

47:34.905 --> 47:37.173
and a diet root beer to
enjoy the silence with.

47:37.175 --> 47:39.039
I can't deal with all this.

47:39.041 --> 47:42.043
You remember <i>Final Destination</i>
and its subsequent sequels?

47:42.045 --> 47:43.711
The teenagers cheated Death,

47:43.713 --> 47:45.281
and then Death came after
them to finish the job?

47:45.283 --> 47:46.749
- Great movie.
- Yeah.

47:46.751 --> 47:49.086
I think you cheated Youth in your 20s

47:49.088 --> 47:53.256
by denying yourself sex, and
reckless behavior, and Fun in general.

47:53.258 --> 47:55.057
Now Fun's come back to claim your soul,

47:55.059 --> 47:58.160
and it's come in the form
of a middle-aged pervert.

47:58.162 --> 48:00.129
What if I outwit Fun?

48:00.131 --> 48:03.566
Perform the old switcheroo to
defend my geriatric way of life.

48:03.568 --> 48:05.535
No, no, you can't outwit Fun, man.

48:05.537 --> 48:07.504
Especially when you're broke,
and Fun's paying the rent.

48:10.909 --> 48:12.543
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

48:14.980 --> 48:16.380
Shit!

48:21.455 --> 48:22.487
Hannah!

48:23.989 --> 48:26.322
What are you doing down
there? Did you find a penny?

48:26.324 --> 48:28.891
No. I'm hiding from an annoying asshole.

48:28.893 --> 48:30.594
Oh.

48:30.596 --> 48:33.298
Listen, I just want to
apologize for the other day.

48:33.300 --> 48:35.501
I had my panties in a pretty tight bunch.

48:35.503 --> 48:39.037
I brought another apology
in the form of a warm scone.

48:39.039 --> 48:40.604
A scone?

48:40.606 --> 48:42.642
Yeah, it's from the German
term <i>"Schonbrot."</i>

48:42.644 --> 48:44.542
Speaking of the old country,

48:44.544 --> 48:46.477
do you happen to have any Germanic breeding

48:46.479 --> 48:48.912
or own a pair of exotic
Lederhosen, by chance?

48:48.914 --> 48:50.381
Nice eye shadow.

48:50.383 --> 48:51.883
Oh, yeah, this is just a shiner

48:51.885 --> 48:54.184
from a drunken duke-out I had last night.

48:54.186 --> 48:55.586
- You did?
- Yeah.

48:55.588 --> 48:58.525
Wow. You know, that's really sexy.

48:58.527 --> 49:00.326
Really?

49:00.328 --> 49:02.328
It's the weirdest thing. I'm
seeing you in this whole new light.

49:02.330 --> 49:05.297
Well, you should see
the other guy. He's fine.

49:05.299 --> 49:07.366
I kind of want you.

49:07.368 --> 49:09.435
- Really?
- No. Go away.

49:09.437 --> 49:10.569
Oh.

49:10.571 --> 49:12.471
Listen...

49:12.473 --> 49:14.605
I'm coming up to see Morgan.

49:14.607 --> 49:16.808
Can't you just leave her alone?

49:16.810 --> 49:19.212
She had me out drinking until
2:00 in the morning last night,

49:19.214 --> 49:21.148
ranting and raving over the sick mind game

49:21.150 --> 49:22.716
that you and Grady are playing.

49:22.718 --> 49:25.519
You two jackoffs are
fucking up my shit now.

49:26.655 --> 49:29.090
Have you tried smoking pot to cool down?

49:29.092 --> 49:32.057
It helps me unwind when I'm
stressed out, like you are now.

49:32.059 --> 49:35.764
Plus, it really increases
my orgasm when I masturbate.

49:35.766 --> 49:38.231
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

49:38.233 --> 49:39.499
You remind me...

49:39.501 --> 49:40.934
Of a girlish Tilda Swinton?

49:40.936 --> 49:42.503
I get that all the time.

49:42.505 --> 49:44.671
No, of a rash I picked up in South America.

49:44.673 --> 49:46.942
Headache, nausea, made my skin crawl.

49:46.944 --> 49:49.911
Sounds like the symptoms of
lovesickness. Maybe I'm growing on you.

49:51.747 --> 49:53.681
You couldn't grow on me with all
the seeds and soil in the world.

49:53.683 --> 49:55.149
Eh. Could you tell Morgan I'm here?

49:55.151 --> 49:56.585
She's in a meeting.

49:56.587 --> 49:59.488
Please. We need to talk about Grady.

50:01.189 --> 50:04.225
Thanks for staying late, guys.
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

50:06.163 --> 50:07.763
Hello.

50:07.765 --> 50:10.700
Ooh. Caramel macchiato. Excellent choice.

50:10.702 --> 50:12.668
Do you want me in on this?

50:12.670 --> 50:14.604
Actually, yes. I do want the
restraint of a witness present.

50:14.606 --> 50:17.005
Hmm, I'd prefer a private sitdown,

50:17.007 --> 50:19.307
so if you don't mind, Hannah.

50:22.713 --> 50:24.347
Is he really living with you?

50:24.349 --> 50:26.782
Yes, he even went grocery shopping.

50:28.019 --> 50:29.784
He's fucking unbelievable.

50:29.786 --> 50:32.021
- You want to know what else he's doing?
- No. What?

50:32.023 --> 50:35.024
Hitting on strange girls,
trying to have sex with them.

50:35.026 --> 50:36.960
Gross, charmless creatures,

50:36.962 --> 50:39.663
not even in your evolutionary
strain, let alone your league.

50:39.665 --> 50:41.330
- No, he isn't.
- Yes, he is!

50:41.332 --> 50:42.799
Okay, relax.

50:42.801 --> 50:44.868
We went out last night "muff scouting."

50:44.870 --> 50:47.569
- His despicable words, not mine.
- Okay, enough.

50:47.571 --> 50:50.140
Do you really want to stay with this man?

50:50.142 --> 50:51.741
A man who'd use your infidelity

50:51.743 --> 50:53.576
- as nothing more than a...
- Okay, will you stop?

50:53.578 --> 50:55.178
..."wham, bam, ram another
ma'am for free" card?

50:55.180 --> 50:56.613
Okay, yeah, enough. Out. Out, go.

50:56.615 --> 50:58.449
Step inside my new kind of love!

50:58.451 --> 51:00.918
Go! Go home to your boyfriend.

51:00.920 --> 51:02.987
You need weed very badly.

51:02.989 --> 51:04.253
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i> loser!

51:04.255 --> 51:07.025
German? I knew it.

51:08.962 --> 51:11.161
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to see Grady.

51:11.163 --> 51:13.465
I mean, I screwed this up,
but it's his fault, too.

51:13.467 --> 51:14.766
No, Morgan...

51:14.768 --> 51:16.400
He can't act like this, okay?

51:16.402 --> 51:17.869
He should be fighting for me, for us.

51:17.871 --> 51:19.804
You would just be wasting your breath.

51:19.806 --> 51:22.640
He is a brain-damaged ape. They all are.

51:22.642 --> 51:26.145
As soon as they get a head full of
steam, they're impossible to control.

51:26.147 --> 51:28.346
So, just let him beat
his chest, wag his dick,

51:28.348 --> 51:32.384
whatever else he needs to do
to start thinking clearly again.

51:32.386 --> 51:35.787
He will come crawling back, I promise.

51:35.789 --> 51:38.991
Now, come on. Worry about you.

51:38.993 --> 51:40.593
Worry about this pitch.

51:43.097 --> 51:46.934
- I don't pay you enough, do I?
- No, you don't.

51:46.936 --> 51:48.602
Let's remember that.

52:01.849 --> 52:05.052
There he is. You ready for
round two there, slugger?

52:05.054 --> 52:07.453
It's ladies' night at
a whiskey bar downtown.

52:07.455 --> 52:10.923
No, no. My head is still
throbbing from last night.

52:10.925 --> 52:14.595
That's evidence of an excellent
two-fisted outing. Congrats.

52:14.597 --> 52:17.031
No, I was hoping we could stay in,

52:17.033 --> 52:20.368
you know, put some ice cubes in the
bong shaft for a nice cool smoke,

52:20.370 --> 52:23.870
order some Thai, maybe hit up
some Easy Listening on Pandora.

52:23.872 --> 52:25.472
Come on, buddy, that sounds like

52:25.474 --> 52:26.774
a fuckin' baby shower in Portland.

52:26.776 --> 52:28.975
We're not gonna get laid like that.

52:28.977 --> 52:30.977
Let's get a little pre-party buzz
going before the Uber arrives.

52:30.979 --> 52:32.980
Listen, I know you're on
vacation and everything,

52:32.982 --> 52:35.148
but just because I agreed to room with you

52:35.150 --> 52:38.052
doesn't mean that I also agreed
to a nightly Rat Pack tribute.

52:38.054 --> 52:40.188
I'm staying in tonight.

52:40.190 --> 52:41.656
You're gonna do what I say,

52:41.658 --> 52:43.491
and that is that we're going out.

52:43.493 --> 52:45.060
You're not the boss of me.

52:45.062 --> 52:47.429
"stopbullying.gov." Visit it.

52:47.431 --> 52:48.964
You know what I've got in here?

52:48.966 --> 52:50.498
The private number of every police chief

52:50.500 --> 52:51.933
and circuit judge in the county.

52:51.935 --> 52:53.369
Big whoop.

52:53.371 --> 52:55.168
How do you think those people would feel

52:55.170 --> 52:58.573
about your attempt to
blackmail my wife for $15,000?

52:59.744 --> 53:02.044
Yeah, that's not good for you.

53:02.046 --> 53:04.178
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna get dressed.

53:04.180 --> 53:08.950
No hoodies, no sneakers, no
disturbingly tight shorts.

53:08.952 --> 53:11.787
I want my wingman to look like a real man.

53:17.695 --> 53:22.766
So I make the mistake
of dressing as sexy Gumby

53:22.768 --> 53:26.268
to my Halloween office party,

53:26.270 --> 53:28.504
and I'm hiding in this room

53:28.506 --> 53:33.977
because my drunk, douchey boss is
always wanting to fuck me and stuff.

53:35.080 --> 53:38.982
So Grady finds me all
upset in the Xerox room,

53:38.984 --> 53:43.085
and he just gives me
this pep talk, you know?

53:43.087 --> 53:47.925
Like, about quitting my job,
and about opening my own firm,

53:47.927 --> 53:52.430
and just fucking getting
life by the balls, you know?

53:52.432 --> 53:56.934
So, five minutes later, my
fucker boss gooses my ass,

53:57.936 --> 54:00.939
so I pick up this bowl of hummus,

54:00.941 --> 54:04.675
and I just smash it over
the fucker's head. Seriously.

54:04.677 --> 54:07.579
Grady was so great at the police station.

54:07.581 --> 54:11.415
I mean, he stood by my side, he got me off,

54:11.417 --> 54:15.288
and then, you know, he got me off.

54:17.089 --> 54:19.792
And, you know, we've just
been together ever since.

54:21.562 --> 54:24.497
He asked if you wanted
chicken on your nachos.

54:28.701 --> 54:30.636
That's not what I heard.

54:32.239 --> 54:36.108
Oh, Jesus, what is this?
It smells like a dead body.

54:36.110 --> 54:37.677
- MacCoinnich.
- What?

54:37.679 --> 54:39.880
Quadruple-distilled. Drink it.

54:43.885 --> 54:45.851
Oh, my God, it's burning me.

54:45.853 --> 54:47.353
It's burning everything.

54:47.355 --> 54:49.456
92% alcohol.

54:49.458 --> 54:52.458
It's what Scottish priests would
drink whenever they were constipated.

54:52.460 --> 54:53.994
Here, do another.

54:53.996 --> 54:55.563
I don't really want to do another one.

54:55.565 --> 54:57.263
- The second one is better.
- Is it?

54:57.265 --> 54:58.665
Do it.

55:00.736 --> 55:02.669
That actually makes me...

55:02.671 --> 55:04.604
Oh, my God, it's worse.

55:04.606 --> 55:07.574
Yeah. It's killing all the
tumors in your throat right now.

55:11.214 --> 55:12.613
- You all right?
- Yeah.

55:12.615 --> 55:14.982
Come on. Drink another.

55:14.984 --> 55:16.350
I mean, we're...

55:16.352 --> 55:18.053
Down the haggis hole.

55:21.991 --> 55:23.757
Yeah!

55:32.536 --> 55:34.704
Hey. You wanna talk?

55:40.375 --> 55:41.776
Who brought a cat?

55:47.251 --> 55:48.584
How long was I out?

55:48.586 --> 55:50.519
About an hour.

55:50.521 --> 55:52.022
Is it midnight yet?

55:52.024 --> 55:53.522
No, it's 9:30.

55:53.524 --> 55:55.057
Come on, keep drinking.

56:04.801 --> 56:06.667
I believe it was Hemingway who once wrote,

56:06.669 --> 56:08.739
"No man is truly a man till he vomits

56:08.741 --> 56:11.042
"behind Big Jim's Pancake House."

56:20.552 --> 56:22.219
Let's go, Grandpa, fuck or fight?

56:22.221 --> 56:24.386
Those are hurtful words, Jerry.

56:24.388 --> 56:26.823
You know, I bluffed the DA
when I had your charges dropped,

56:27.692 --> 56:29.726
but I'm not bluffing today.

56:29.728 --> 56:31.761
Look at that.

56:31.763 --> 56:33.564
Hey, wait a second.

56:33.566 --> 56:35.768
Where the fuck is everybody?

56:39.006 --> 56:40.504
Stensland.

56:40.506 --> 56:42.705
She's left him.

57:03.629 --> 57:04.930
Grady, let me in!

57:15.609 --> 57:17.009
Grady!

57:17.011 --> 57:19.812
Let me in! Grady, please let me in!

57:21.450 --> 57:24.550
I have had more alcohol
than oxygen for a week.

57:24.552 --> 57:29.622
I can't wait to get home and
slip into my jimmy-jammies.

57:29.624 --> 57:33.392
Cabbie, Campus and 27th. Step on it.

57:33.394 --> 57:35.929
What campus? Campus?

57:38.367 --> 57:41.635
Stensland! Stensland! Stensland!

57:41.637 --> 57:44.773
Stensland! Stensland! Stensland!

57:51.714 --> 57:52.913
Stop it!

57:52.915 --> 57:56.549
I said, shut up, God damn it!

57:58.522 --> 58:01.522
What's wrong with you people?

58:01.524 --> 58:05.458
Has the collegiate experience
become so dull in this country

58:05.460 --> 58:08.295
that causing irreversible
harm to your bodies

58:08.297 --> 58:12.335
with this binge drinking is
the only way to have a hoot?

58:14.403 --> 58:16.938
This isn't fun!

58:16.940 --> 58:19.206
This is sadomasochism!

58:19.208 --> 58:23.679
Have you never heard of board games?

58:23.681 --> 58:26.981
<i>Scattergories</i> is a laugh riot!

58:26.983 --> 58:30.552
Whatever happened to Spin the Bottle

58:30.554 --> 58:33.223
and kiss-chasing on the green?

58:34.625 --> 58:36.761
You're all alcoholics.

58:37.560 --> 58:41.096
You need to attend meetings!

58:41.098 --> 58:46.368
Well, screw it, I'm making a stand!

58:46.370 --> 58:51.473
Let's put an end to these
black sabbaths and brain damage!

58:51.475 --> 58:53.009
Join me and say,

58:53.011 --> 58:58.351
"We don't have to be
party animals to be cool!"

59:07.994 --> 59:10.760
Let's make him drink from the hobo's boot!

59:10.762 --> 59:12.996
Yeah!

59:12.998 --> 59:16.499
Hobo's boot! Hobo's boot!

59:16.501 --> 59:19.668
Hobo's boot! Hobo's boot!

59:19.670 --> 59:21.740
Hobo's boot! Hobo's boot!

59:21.742 --> 59:23.207
Hobo's boot!

59:23.209 --> 59:27.778
Hobo's boot! Hobo's boot! Hobo's boot!

59:30.283 --> 59:32.049
How did that boot taste, buddy?

59:32.051 --> 59:34.118
Like homelessness in my mouth.

59:34.120 --> 59:36.254
Why did you make them refill it?

59:36.256 --> 59:39.490
We didn't have enough camera
coverage for the YouTube video.

59:39.492 --> 59:41.593
Hey, it was the hit of the
party. You're gonna be a legend.

59:41.595 --> 59:45.030
Please tell me you found your
"bang strange" lady tonight.

59:45.032 --> 59:46.665
I didn't, I didn't,

59:46.667 --> 59:49.302
but Bacardi's is hosting a
pool party tomorrow night.

59:49.304 --> 59:51.835
There'll be fur-burgers
grilling all night long.

59:51.837 --> 59:53.538
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow night.

59:53.540 --> 59:55.507
- I don't...
- Come on. Come on, watch your head.

59:55.509 --> 59:57.909
Watch your head, watch
your head, watch your head.

01:00:13.729 --> 01:00:16.629
You know what? We're going
to take a quick detour.

01:00:16.631 --> 01:00:18.298
Uh...

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:21.768
When you hit this stop
sign, let's go to the right.

01:00:41.857 --> 01:00:43.759
My tummy hurts.

01:00:45.962 --> 01:00:47.963
Uh, we'd better get going.

01:01:12.122 --> 01:01:13.891
Oh, God!

01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:21.698
Uh, we need to turn around.

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:23.234
He fell out.

01:01:30.843 --> 01:01:32.810
Where did I come from?

01:01:38.015 --> 01:01:39.281
Thank you.

01:01:52.898 --> 01:01:54.097
Stensland?

01:01:55.702 --> 01:01:57.735
Oh...

01:01:57.737 --> 01:02:00.170
Please don't be mean to me right
now. I'm hanging on by a thread.

01:02:00.172 --> 01:02:02.673
What the hell are you doing here?

01:02:02.675 --> 01:02:04.474
I'm hiding from Grady.

01:02:04.476 --> 01:02:06.677
At Soft Solutions?

01:02:06.679 --> 01:02:08.712
Yeah. It's my favorite place.

01:02:08.714 --> 01:02:11.817
It's clean, comfortable,
the staff are warm-hearted.

01:02:12.553 --> 01:02:13.953
Stensy!

01:02:13.955 --> 01:02:16.957
Hey, Brandon, looking
svelte, <i>hombre.</i>

01:02:18.024 --> 01:02:20.091
They're so nice to me here.

01:02:20.093 --> 01:02:21.926
Oh, God, you're weird.

01:02:21.928 --> 01:02:23.962
Okay, well, I'll leave you to it.

01:02:23.964 --> 01:02:25.696
No, no, no, please don't go.

01:02:25.698 --> 01:02:28.767
Come on. We need to talk.
Let's square our beef.

01:02:28.769 --> 01:02:32.271
Come and check out the "Casual
Refinement" Living Room set, huh?

01:02:32.273 --> 01:02:34.274
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.780
There we go.

01:02:41.782 --> 01:02:44.749
Take a deep breath, relax.

01:02:44.751 --> 01:02:48.753
Let the comfort and ambience envelop you.

01:02:48.755 --> 01:02:53.492
So, madam, what brings you
to Soft Solutions today?

01:02:53.494 --> 01:02:57.729
Are you shopping for a
new home or just browsing?

01:02:57.731 --> 01:02:59.531
None of the above.

01:02:59.533 --> 01:03:01.834
Returning a hideous Moroccan
throw rug for Morgan.

01:03:01.836 --> 01:03:04.571
God damn it. I picked that out for her.

01:03:05.374 --> 01:03:06.939
You did?

01:03:07.776 --> 01:03:09.276
You met Morgan here?

01:03:09.278 --> 01:03:12.745
Yeah. In Decor Enrichments.

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:14.913
God, she was so beautiful.

01:03:14.915 --> 01:03:18.718
I was intimidated, to say
the least, but, I don't know,

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:23.224
I got brave, we started
talking, and we clicked.

01:03:25.261 --> 01:03:27.296
I just wanted a girlfriend.

01:03:27.797 --> 01:03:29.795
Aw.

01:03:29.797 --> 01:03:33.601
Okay, listen, let me give you
a tip as your search continues.

01:03:33.603 --> 01:03:35.802
Going psycho and blackmailing a woman

01:03:35.804 --> 01:03:38.474
isn't going to change her mind
about your boyfriend potential.

01:03:38.476 --> 01:03:40.443
- That's fair enough.
- Yeah.

01:03:41.576 --> 01:03:43.611
You know she really loves Grady, right?

01:03:45.649 --> 01:03:47.783
Yeah, I know.

01:03:47.785 --> 01:03:50.886
God, I can't wait to get
these people out of my life.

01:03:50.888 --> 01:03:52.821
- Then kick Grady out.
- I can't.

01:03:52.823 --> 01:03:55.591
I'm a blackmailer, remember?
He could have me arrested.

01:03:55.593 --> 01:03:58.127
I'm his Kunta Kinte until
he decides to set me free.

01:03:58.129 --> 01:04:01.129
That's not gonna happen until he
balances the scales with Morgan

01:04:01.131 --> 01:04:03.031
and gets his revenge schtup.

01:04:03.033 --> 01:04:04.700
Okay, so then what are you doing

01:04:04.702 --> 01:04:06.367
to help him on this ridiculous mission?

01:04:06.369 --> 01:04:08.339
Nothing. I hate going out.

01:04:08.341 --> 01:04:10.306
I'm a total curmudgeon.

01:04:10.308 --> 01:04:12.041
And a whiny little bitch.

01:04:12.043 --> 01:04:14.210
I wear pajama tops and
flip flops to nightclubs.

01:04:14.212 --> 01:04:17.045
You have the social skills of
a truck driver with Asperger's.

01:04:17.047 --> 01:04:18.480
I'm a horrible wingman.

01:04:18.482 --> 01:04:20.984
You're like a colossal cockblocker.

01:04:21.786 --> 01:04:23.453
Oh, my God.

01:04:23.455 --> 01:04:25.054
Hannah.

01:04:25.056 --> 01:04:28.190
I'm the reason Grady hasn't
pulled the dick trigger.

01:04:28.192 --> 01:04:30.694
Good God, you're a genius.

01:04:30.696 --> 01:04:34.064
You're just realizing this now?

01:04:34.066 --> 01:04:37.903
Grady? Where are we headed tonight?

01:04:37.905 --> 01:04:40.005
I am parched for hootch!

01:04:40.807 --> 01:04:42.474
<i>Dear Dumbass.</i>

01:04:42.476 --> 01:04:44.374
<i>I have some work to
get done at the office.</i>

01:04:44.376 --> 01:04:45.908
<i>Consider yourself on parole.</i>

01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:48.412
<i>Love, the Motherfucker in Charge.</i>

01:04:50.481 --> 01:04:53.016
Not on my watch, Kemosabe.

01:05:32.394 --> 01:05:35.195
Yeah, looking good, Stensy.

01:05:40.367 --> 01:05:41.767
Keep the change, baby.

01:05:43.003 --> 01:05:44.372
Get yourself something nice.

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:49.143
What was that?

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:20.708
It's checking out time.

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:22.976
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:06:22.978 --> 01:06:25.512
Put that shit away. It's Thursday
night, weekend's already started.

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:27.682
Jesus Christ, you look like shit.

01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:29.851
Is that my Rocco Richetti pinstripe?

01:06:29.853 --> 01:06:32.486
Yeah. Fits like a condom, right?

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:34.422
All I'm saying is Ladies' Night

01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:37.024
at the Trinity Club is already in progress.

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:40.361
Three floors of DJs,
dancing, and binge drinking.

01:06:40.363 --> 01:06:43.198
You take all those ingredients,
put 'em in a muffin pan,

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.767
when they come out of the oven,

01:06:44.769 --> 01:06:46.901
they're hot, sweaty,
and destined for regret.

01:06:46.903 --> 01:06:50.272
Come on. Are we gonna settle
the score with Morgan or what?

01:06:50.274 --> 01:06:53.209
Let's finish what you fuckin' started.

01:06:57.449 --> 01:07:00.083
You know what? You're right.

01:07:00.085 --> 01:07:02.320
Fuck it. Let's do it.

01:07:08.092 --> 01:07:10.927
Who is the ringleader? You're
up! You're up. You're up.

01:07:10.929 --> 01:07:14.730
Who is the ringleader? You're
up! You're up! You're up!

01:07:14.732 --> 01:07:17.334
Who is the ringleader? You're...

01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:21.305
- Wow. You guys live here?
- Yeah.

01:07:21.307 --> 01:07:25.109
We've stripped away all the
snobbery of modern trendy furnishing

01:07:25.111 --> 01:07:29.245
to create a streamlined
hidey-hole of purified partying.

01:07:29.247 --> 01:07:31.149
We call it "beatnik chic."

01:07:31.151 --> 01:07:32.749
- Works for me.
- Cool.

01:07:32.751 --> 01:07:35.252
- Tequila!
- Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

01:07:35.254 --> 01:07:38.055
Fuck. I lasso Doublemint twins for us,

01:07:38.057 --> 01:07:40.191
and you sit here like
a gassy infant? Come on!

01:07:40.193 --> 01:07:42.260
- What the fuck happened to you?
- Burns so good, baby.

01:07:42.262 --> 01:07:44.063
Ai!
Yi-yi-yi-yi!

01:07:44.065 --> 01:07:46.864
- Was that a Middle Eastern war cry?
- That was.

01:07:46.866 --> 01:07:48.400
- Where did that come from?
- I don't know.

01:07:48.402 --> 01:07:50.003
You get up off of your vagina.

01:07:50.005 --> 01:07:51.902
You're embarrassing yourself. Come on.

01:07:51.904 --> 01:07:53.273
Fuck.

01:07:53.275 --> 01:07:54.639
The next one's for you, handsome.

01:07:54.641 --> 01:07:56.241
Remember what we're doing here.

01:07:56.243 --> 01:07:57.675
Thank you.

01:07:57.677 --> 01:07:59.244
Are we too cray-cray for you, Grady?

01:07:59.246 --> 01:08:00.679
Yes.

01:08:00.681 --> 01:08:02.313
You'll have to excuse my friend.

01:08:02.315 --> 01:08:04.516
He gets bashful around beautiful women.

01:08:04.518 --> 01:08:06.185
- Aw!
- Aw!

01:08:06.187 --> 01:08:08.789
- We need music.
- Yes!

01:08:08.791 --> 01:08:11.957
Whoa... Cool! Records,
just like my nana's house.

01:08:11.959 --> 01:08:15.062
The next shots are gonna
come out of my navel, boys.

01:08:15.064 --> 01:08:17.398
- Here, help me up, Stensy.
- Ooh. Yeah.

01:08:18.096 --> 01:08:20.600
I got it. Billy Ocean!

01:08:21.636 --> 01:08:24.071
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

01:08:24.073 --> 01:08:27.206
You know, I don't think Billy
Ocean is such a good idea.

01:08:27.207 --> 01:08:28.540
Who's Billy Ocean?

01:08:28.542 --> 01:08:30.174
What's your problem with Billy Ocean?

01:08:30.176 --> 01:08:33.546
I... I just react strangely
to his music, okay?

01:08:33.548 --> 01:08:36.015
I just... I just have an
emotional relationship.

01:08:36.017 --> 01:08:39.653
There's a lot of history there,
okay? So, don't put it on.

01:08:39.654 --> 01:08:41.523
Hmm. You hear that, girls?

01:08:41.524 --> 01:08:44.457
Stensland reacts strangely
to Billy Ocean's music.

01:08:44.459 --> 01:08:46.894
No, no, no, elaborate.

01:08:46.895 --> 01:08:49.395
- No, I don't really...
- Come on! Please?

01:08:49.397 --> 01:08:51.131
- No, no, no, because...
- Stensy...

01:08:51.133 --> 01:08:53.100
Fine, fine, okay. It's...

01:08:53.102 --> 01:08:58.238
It's kind of sappy, but,
uh, it's genuine Stensland.

01:08:58.241 --> 01:08:59.841
All right.

01:08:59.843 --> 01:09:02.510
Amber McGinnitty was the prettiest

01:09:02.511 --> 01:09:04.877
12-year-old in the
history of 12-year-olds.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:09.950
She loved Billy Ocean, and I
loved her, so I studied him.

01:09:09.952 --> 01:09:15.157
He was everything I wasn't.
Suave, soulful, fashionable, black.

01:09:15.158 --> 01:09:18.327
My mother made me a little
white suit just like Billy's.

01:09:18.328 --> 01:09:23.433
I put it on, locked myself in my
bedroom, and danced to his jams.

01:09:25.437 --> 01:09:28.706
And then I'd cry and feel sorry for myself.

01:09:29.139 --> 01:09:30.238
Oh...

01:09:30.241 --> 01:09:31.841
Aw...

01:09:31.843 --> 01:09:34.509
So, anytime I hear the
sounds of the Ocean now,

01:09:34.511 --> 01:09:38.615
it just puts me in mind
of Amber McGinnitty.

01:09:38.617 --> 01:09:39.848
Well, did you ask her out?

01:09:39.850 --> 01:09:42.417
Yes, to the Tropical Para-dance.

01:09:42.419 --> 01:09:44.354
And she said yes?

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.160
- Oh!
- Oh...

01:09:50.162 --> 01:09:51.995
- Oh...
- Ooh.

01:09:51.997 --> 01:09:54.096
- Oh, Stensy...
- Oh, that's nice.

01:09:54.099 --> 01:09:57.802
Hey. Hey, hey. I would
hug you, too, but, um...

01:09:57.804 --> 01:10:00.405
I've got a beverage in my bellybutton.

01:10:00.407 --> 01:10:02.871
- Come on.
- Come on.

01:10:02.873 --> 01:10:04.407
Um...

01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:06.743
Suck me.

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:09.682
Do it. Suck her.

01:10:22.227 --> 01:10:23.394
Go, Stensy!

01:10:38.311 --> 01:10:40.779
Yeah, Stensy! Whoo!

01:10:45.384 --> 01:10:46.953
Whoo!

01:10:48.589 --> 01:10:50.957
Whoo!

01:11:33.502 --> 01:11:34.935
Fucking slut.

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.505
What?

01:11:38.507 --> 01:11:42.675
I'm sorry. Samantha is a fucking slut.

01:11:42.677 --> 01:11:45.179
You're nice, Stensland. It's just...

01:11:45.181 --> 01:11:47.782
I kind of had my heart set on Grady,

01:11:47.784 --> 01:11:50.350
and fucking bitch Samantha does it again!

01:11:50.352 --> 01:11:53.321
She just sluts it up so early
that they can't even choose

01:11:53.323 --> 01:11:55.189
when it comes time to pick rooms,

01:11:55.191 --> 01:11:56.424
and then I just always get
stuck with the, you know...

01:11:56.426 --> 01:11:57.993
With the what?

01:11:58.727 --> 01:12:01.027
With the dorky one?

01:12:01.029 --> 01:12:05.867
With the pale and waifish
pity case? The goat boy?

01:12:05.869 --> 01:12:10.440
The sad sack who only watches
programming intended for teen girls?

01:12:15.713 --> 01:12:17.482
I'm sorry.

01:12:21.252 --> 01:12:24.922
Oh, my God! This bathroom is disgusting!

01:12:48.647 --> 01:12:50.078
What?

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.382
<i>Well, I did it last night.</i>

01:12:52.384 --> 01:12:53.917
You did what last night?

01:12:53.919 --> 01:12:57.623
<i>She was young and quite gorgeous.</i>

01:12:58.825 --> 01:13:02.028
So, how's it feel?

01:13:06.732 --> 01:13:08.501
It feels awful.

01:13:10.304 --> 01:13:11.804
<i>Is there anything else?</i>

01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:15.239
No.

01:13:15.241 --> 01:13:18.042
I've got nothing else to say, Morgan.

01:13:19.814 --> 01:13:23.083
<i>Well, then goodbye, Grady.</i>

01:13:23.618 --> 01:13:25.085
Goodbye.

01:13:31.359 --> 01:13:33.058
Oh, hey.

01:13:34.930 --> 01:13:36.963
Sorry about last night.

01:13:38.099 --> 01:13:39.766
Yeah.

01:13:39.768 --> 01:13:41.536
Whatever.

01:14:03.892 --> 01:14:05.558
Hey, Stensland.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.026
Good morning, Michael.

01:14:10.467 --> 01:14:11.933
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:14:23.914 --> 01:14:25.913
Excuse me, can you help me?

01:14:25.915 --> 01:14:28.784
I'm sorry, I don't actually work here.

01:14:29.818 --> 01:14:33.288
Are you Billy Ocean?

01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:35.489
Feelin' pretty blue, huh, Stensy?

01:14:35.491 --> 01:14:40.261
Deep blue, Billy. I fucked up, big style.

01:14:40.263 --> 01:14:42.530
You sure did, my pale friend.

01:14:42.532 --> 01:14:48.003
I indulged Grady's penis when it
was his heart that needed a hand.

01:14:48.005 --> 01:14:50.806
Ah, this beach party ain't over, Stensy.

01:14:50.808 --> 01:14:52.374
It runs on island time.

01:14:52.376 --> 01:14:55.209
What's track number six
off of <i>Love Zone?</i>

01:14:55.211 --> 01:14:56.778
Track number six...

01:14:57.782 --> 01:15:00.282
<i>It's Never Too Late To Try.</i>

01:15:00.284 --> 01:15:02.318
Slip on a new pair of boat shoes.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.353
The world needs your help, Stensy.

01:15:04.355 --> 01:15:05.989
In fact, I need your help right now.

01:15:05.991 --> 01:15:07.857
- You do?
- I do.

01:15:07.859 --> 01:15:11.661
Where can I find me a love
seat impervious to cat pee?

01:15:12.531 --> 01:15:13.995
What?

01:15:13.997 --> 01:15:15.865
Do you know, young man?

01:15:15.867 --> 01:15:18.668
I... Wait, where did your breezy suit go?

01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:20.472
You're not Billy Ocean.

01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:22.438
Breezy suit? Focus, son.

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.575
I'm looking for a love
seat that won't stain

01:15:24.577 --> 01:15:27.712
when my wife's crazy
cat takes a whizz on it.

01:15:28.213 --> 01:15:29.646
Oh.

01:15:29.648 --> 01:15:31.349
Yeah, uh, of course.

01:15:31.351 --> 01:15:33.417
Well, the "Home Sweet Home" collection

01:15:33.419 --> 01:15:36.254
has an optional stain-resistant fabric.

01:15:36.256 --> 01:15:37.454
Excellent.

01:15:37.456 --> 01:15:39.223
Come right this way, sir.

01:15:39.225 --> 01:15:41.857
Now, this textile has the
look and feel of cotton,

01:15:41.859 --> 01:15:44.295
but totally kicks blemishes to the curb.

01:15:44.297 --> 01:15:47.132
Perfect. Does it come in tropical print?

01:15:48.267 --> 01:15:50.667
- Morgan!
- Oh, jeez.

01:15:50.669 --> 01:15:53.438
Did you eat all the Bismarcks? There's
not gonna be enough for the clients.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:57.442
I'm sorry. I'm a little
upside down right now.

01:15:57.444 --> 01:16:00.811
Oh, Grady. Grady finally
got his revenge last night.

01:16:00.813 --> 01:16:02.413
He what?

01:16:02.415 --> 01:16:03.515
Oh...

01:16:03.517 --> 01:16:04.983
Yep.

01:16:04.985 --> 01:16:06.784
- Who was it?
- I don't know,

01:16:06.786 --> 01:16:09.788
but up in here, she looks like
Jessica Rabbit, only sexier.

01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:13.459
I'm sorry. You can't be that surprised.

01:16:13.461 --> 01:16:15.461
No, you're right, I'm not.

01:16:15.463 --> 01:16:16.995
Can we look on the bright side?

01:16:16.997 --> 01:16:18.396
We have more donuts?

01:16:18.398 --> 01:16:21.199
No. Now, in Grady's stubborn mind,

01:16:21.201 --> 01:16:23.068
the scales have finally been balanced.

01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:25.203
He's shot his spiteful
wad, and we both know

01:16:25.205 --> 01:16:27.806
what happens to guys
after they blow their load.

01:16:27.808 --> 01:16:29.208
They get real.

01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:31.410
It's too late to get real, Hannah.

01:16:31.412 --> 01:16:35.249
I mean, it is over. It is over
like smoking on planes is over.

01:16:35.251 --> 01:16:37.317
I'm telling you, if he was
to walk in here right now

01:16:37.319 --> 01:16:39.151
and get down on his knees

01:16:39.153 --> 01:16:41.254
with the Hope Diamond, I
would not take him back.

01:16:41.256 --> 01:16:43.356
Fuck him.

01:16:43.358 --> 01:16:48.427
Fuck him and his... His dreamy blue eyes.

01:16:48.429 --> 01:16:51.732
Oh, God, I hope Judy in
Accounting has mini-Snickers.

01:16:57.439 --> 01:17:00.107
Oh, hello there.

01:17:00.109 --> 01:17:04.580
Just wanted to pay you in
advance for the kid's rent.

01:17:04.582 --> 01:17:06.647
Just a couple of months.

01:17:08.583 --> 01:17:10.518
Stensland.

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:11.920
Thank you.

01:17:18.728 --> 01:17:21.063
- Hey.
- You got a job?

01:17:21.065 --> 01:17:24.100
Yeah, my new grindstone.

01:17:25.401 --> 01:17:27.135
Well, you look sharp.

01:17:27.137 --> 01:17:29.773
- Thanks.
- Congratulations.

01:17:30.607 --> 01:17:32.541
Where are you going?

01:17:32.543 --> 01:17:35.778
Ah, get some work done, then
check into the Four Seasons.

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:37.380
I tormented you long enough.

01:17:40.884 --> 01:17:43.020
You slept with Samantha, I assume?

01:17:45.958 --> 01:17:49.059
No, I didn't. I couldn't.

01:17:52.063 --> 01:17:54.365
Well, you know,

01:17:55.534 --> 01:17:57.967
the heart pumps blood into the penis,

01:17:57.969 --> 01:17:59.435
but when that heart is broken...

01:17:59.437 --> 01:18:02.570
- Oh, God, give me a break.
- ...the penis...

01:18:02.572 --> 01:18:05.408
My penis wasn't the problem, dumbass.

01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:07.578
And if you're so smart about this stuff,

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.780
why did she fuck around
on me to begin with?

01:18:09.782 --> 01:18:11.714
- With you!
- I don't know.

01:18:11.716 --> 01:18:16.086
Isn't marriage supposedly
harder than pole vaulting?

01:18:16.088 --> 01:18:19.522
My parents lasted for four
years and threw in the sponge.

01:18:19.524 --> 01:18:22.259
You and Morgan prevailed for 15.

01:18:22.261 --> 01:18:24.128
But after 15 years of anything,

01:18:24.130 --> 01:18:27.297
even something good is bound
to fritz a little, right?

01:18:27.299 --> 01:18:30.299
I don't know if it's been good
for a long time, Stensland.

01:18:30.301 --> 01:18:32.704
Whose fault is that, do you think?

01:18:32.706 --> 01:18:35.708
I'm sorry, but why don't you just go home?

01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:37.107
To Morgan.

01:18:37.109 --> 01:18:40.012
You know she's sorry! You are too!

01:18:40.014 --> 01:18:43.080
Because everything has changed, that's why.

01:18:43.082 --> 01:18:45.650
No, look, your love has just been tested.

01:18:45.652 --> 01:18:47.919
Like Aladdin in the Cave of Wonders,

01:18:47.921 --> 01:18:52.156
or when Wonka's golden ticket-holders
got Everlasting Gobstoppers.

01:18:52.158 --> 01:18:54.691
You passed the test, Grady.

01:18:54.693 --> 01:18:56.629
You still love each other!

01:18:56.631 --> 01:18:59.564
Sometimes, you have to
lose somebody completely

01:18:59.566 --> 01:19:03.435
before you can figure out
what they really mean to you.

01:19:03.437 --> 01:19:06.106
Why don't you go and tell her that?

01:19:07.641 --> 01:19:11.576
I appreciate you caring.
It's not that simple.

01:19:11.578 --> 01:19:12.645
Goodbye, Stensland.

01:19:14.048 --> 01:19:16.380
Your butch ego is getting in the way

01:19:16.382 --> 01:19:19.487
of your happiness, you asshole!

01:19:19.489 --> 01:19:21.720
You're really not going to her?

01:19:21.722 --> 01:19:24.359
No, I am not going to her.

01:19:25.027 --> 01:19:30.363
Okay. Well... I am.

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:33.600
You wanna know why she
cheated on you? The truth?

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:35.269
It's because of me.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:37.505
I'm the romantic and sensitive type of man

01:19:37.507 --> 01:19:39.607
Morgan knows she should've married.

01:19:39.609 --> 01:19:42.542
All I had to do was pay
her one gooey compliment,

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:45.579
and those waterlogged
panties hit the floor.

01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:46.582
Ker-splash.

01:19:47.517 --> 01:19:49.284
Your wife is the finest piece

01:19:49.286 --> 01:19:51.517
of ass and boobs I've ever tasted,

01:19:51.519 --> 01:19:54.221
and I'm going right back
to her office, right now

01:19:54.223 --> 01:19:56.257
to get me some more!

01:19:56.259 --> 01:19:58.827
Son of a bitch. Stensland!

01:19:58.829 --> 01:20:02.131
My tongue is gonna be in her
vagina so long, it'll pickle!

01:20:02.133 --> 01:20:04.164
I'm gonna make her go...

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:08.603
All over again!

01:20:08.605 --> 01:20:11.106
Come on. I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:20:11.108 --> 01:20:12.976
You don't deserve her! I do!

01:20:12.978 --> 01:20:15.643
I'm gonna bury you, dig
you up, and kill you again!

01:20:15.645 --> 01:20:17.212
I'm killing you.

01:20:17.214 --> 01:20:18.982
Hey, girls.

01:20:19.751 --> 01:20:21.649
Sorry.

01:20:21.651 --> 01:20:23.919
- I owe you one.
- No problem, sweetheart.

01:20:23.921 --> 01:20:25.957
Stensland, you little prick!

01:20:26.724 --> 01:20:27.923
Ooh.

01:20:27.925 --> 01:20:29.257
Must be the husband.

01:20:29.259 --> 01:20:31.128
- I guess so.
- Mm-hmm. I'd tap that.

01:20:37.935 --> 01:20:39.336
Not now, Muumuu!

01:20:40.939 --> 01:20:42.372
Stensland!

01:20:46.878 --> 01:20:48.078
Ooh!

01:21:01.561 --> 01:21:04.361
Stay! Stay! Stay!

01:21:04.363 --> 01:21:06.363
Stay! Stay, stay!

01:21:06.365 --> 01:21:09.501
What the... Those are
$2,000 pants, asshole!

01:21:09.503 --> 01:21:11.167
Morgan needs a fresh young buck,

01:21:11.169 --> 01:21:13.237
not a bitter old nelly! Fuck you!

01:21:13.239 --> 01:21:14.607
Son of a bitch.

01:21:18.977 --> 01:21:20.613
What the hell do you want?

01:21:20.615 --> 01:21:22.248
Stensland!

01:21:23.849 --> 01:21:26.386
Hey! Hey!

01:21:26.388 --> 01:21:28.422
Come back here, you little shit!

01:21:35.827 --> 01:21:37.596
Son of a bitch!

01:21:40.767 --> 01:21:42.568
Where the fuck...

01:21:44.005 --> 01:21:45.503
- Counselor?
- Tiny!

01:21:45.505 --> 01:21:47.106
Carrot-top,
half-pants, which way?

01:21:47.108 --> 01:21:49.241
Through the house. Want a knife?

01:21:49.243 --> 01:21:50.976
No, I'm good. Thanks, Tiny.

01:21:50.978 --> 01:21:54.113
Re-draw hearing Tuesday!
Judge's chambers! Don't be late!

01:21:54.115 --> 01:21:56.483
That's my lawyer.

01:22:02.322 --> 01:22:04.789
I'm gonna put my willy in her!

01:22:04.791 --> 01:22:06.224
Son of a bitch!

01:22:09.332 --> 01:22:11.030
Fuck you!

01:22:11.032 --> 01:22:12.598
Die, fucker.

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.368
Taxi! Sorry.

01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:24.079
So, where to, gentlemen?

01:22:28.917 --> 01:22:30.150
Okay.

01:22:33.724 --> 01:22:35.691
- Going up, in her vagina.
- You little bitch.

01:22:38.529 --> 01:22:40.194
So, what impact does traditional

01:22:40.196 --> 01:22:41.996
earned media have in the marketplace?

01:22:41.998 --> 01:22:43.263
Well, I'm going to tell you.

01:22:43.265 --> 01:22:45.800
Oh, shit.

01:22:45.802 --> 01:22:47.302
Call the paramedics!

01:22:49.472 --> 01:22:51.438
Now you're going to get
the ass-kicking you deserve.

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.273
Could you just free my windpipe?

01:22:53.275 --> 01:22:55.476
- No.
- I'm getting an erection.

01:22:55.478 --> 01:22:57.645
Call security, please.

01:22:57.647 --> 01:23:00.217
I'm really sorry, everyone. Um...

01:23:00.816 --> 01:23:03.118
I apologize.

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:07.690
We are going to have to
reschedule this. I'm so sorry.

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.460
So...

01:23:10.462 --> 01:23:13.498
Okay, folks. I'll call you
tomorrow to reschedule. Thank you.

01:23:15.366 --> 01:23:18.503
- Sorry.
- The pitch was blown anyway.

01:23:20.205 --> 01:23:21.872
Thank you. Grady.

01:23:22.808 --> 01:23:25.309
Hannah.

01:23:25.311 --> 01:23:28.378
Four weeks, I've been
working on that presentation.

01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:31.782
Morgan, he's come to apologize.

01:23:31.784 --> 01:23:35.318
- Wait, hang on.
- Yes, you did, Grady.

01:23:37.322 --> 01:23:39.221
Morgan,

01:23:39.223 --> 01:23:40.856
you should've seen how he reacted

01:23:40.858 --> 01:23:43.959
when I told him I was coming
here to fuck you again.

01:23:43.961 --> 01:23:48.400
He was transformed into
a violent love werewolf.

01:23:48.402 --> 01:23:51.303
Cursed not by the bite
of another love wolf,

01:23:51.305 --> 01:23:57.508
but by his ferocious, undying
love for you, his luminous bride.

01:23:57.510 --> 01:24:00.177
This romance has teeth, people.

01:24:00.179 --> 01:24:04.882
Your saga puts me in mind of
Napoleon and Josephine in many ways.

01:24:05.919 --> 01:24:07.719
- Despite adultery and...
- Stensland.

01:24:07.721 --> 01:24:09.556
Yeah? Oh.

01:24:15.895 --> 01:24:17.563
Come on, Grady.

01:24:22.971 --> 01:24:24.937
We wouldn't have burst in like this

01:24:24.939 --> 01:24:27.539
if I'd known that, you
know, the pitch was today.

01:24:27.541 --> 01:24:30.008
Oh, but how would you have
known about this pitch?

01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:31.511
It didn't involve you.

01:24:32.378 --> 01:24:34.179
It doesn't matter.

01:24:34.181 --> 01:24:36.250
Hannah's right. It was
screwed from the beginning.

01:24:36.717 --> 01:24:38.117
Really?

01:24:38.119 --> 01:24:40.319
But you're the best
PowerPoint player in the game.

01:24:40.321 --> 01:24:41.822
Yeah, well, you know what?

01:24:41.824 --> 01:24:43.455
Not on the day that my husband calls me

01:24:43.457 --> 01:24:44.624
to tell me he screwed someone else.

01:24:46.328 --> 01:24:47.527
Right.

01:24:48.564 --> 01:24:50.197
He's gonna fuck this up.

01:24:50.199 --> 01:24:51.764
No, he won't.

01:24:51.766 --> 01:24:54.199
Come on, Grady, give her the straight shit.

01:24:54.201 --> 01:24:56.237
Listen, Morgan, I, uh...

01:24:57.472 --> 01:24:59.472
I lied about that.

01:24:59.474 --> 01:25:02.042
I didn't sleep with anybody.

01:25:02.044 --> 01:25:04.679
I tried, but I didn't.

01:25:05.246 --> 01:25:06.680
Why not?

01:25:06.682 --> 01:25:09.684
Because I couldn't stop thinking about you.

01:25:11.219 --> 01:25:12.719
And about us.

01:25:14.156 --> 01:25:15.556
That's good.

01:25:17.959 --> 01:25:21.229
I owe you an apology, and I get that now.

01:25:21.231 --> 01:25:22.964
Grady, what do you get?

01:25:22.966 --> 01:25:26.500
That I'm the one that
screwed up our marriage.

01:25:26.502 --> 01:25:30.872
I neglected you, and I abandoned us.

01:25:30.874 --> 01:25:34.375
And your firm took off,
and my career took off...

01:25:34.377 --> 01:25:38.113
I tried. I was trying so hard, Grady.

01:25:38.115 --> 01:25:39.681
I know you did.

01:25:39.683 --> 01:25:43.318
I saw it. But I was stupid, and I was lazy,

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:47.688
and I took you, the only woman
I've ever been in love with,

01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:51.227
I took you for granted, just like a...

01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:53.030
An asshole.

01:25:54.297 --> 01:25:55.831
And I'm sorry, Morgan.

01:25:57.135 --> 01:26:00.268
But assholes can learn.

01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:04.974
And I think, in a positive
way, our love has been tested.

01:26:04.976 --> 01:26:10.112
Not unlike Aladdin in the Thunder Cave,

01:26:10.114 --> 01:26:15.553
or even Willy Wonka when
he was giving food away

01:26:15.555 --> 01:26:17.586
- to the homeless.
- What?

01:26:17.588 --> 01:26:19.855
He's getting Wonka all wrong.

01:26:22.659 --> 01:26:25.962
Oh, Grady. I'm sorry, too.

01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:31.969
Look, I do know one thing.

01:26:31.971 --> 01:26:35.939
Sometimes you have to
completely lose somebody

01:26:35.941 --> 01:26:39.509
before you can really
appreciate what they mean to you.

01:26:42.882 --> 01:26:45.716
Fucker.

01:26:45.718 --> 01:26:48.586
- I'm almost impressed right now.
- Oh, don't be.

01:26:48.588 --> 01:26:50.688
Grady subconsciously knew what I was doing.

01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:52.323
- You think?
- Yeah.

01:26:52.325 --> 01:26:54.761
He's too mule-headed to
come see her on his own,

01:26:54.763 --> 01:26:56.794
so I just gave him an
excuse rooted in an emotion

01:26:56.796 --> 01:27:00.333
he's comfortable expressing.
Blind, vengeful fury.

01:27:00.335 --> 01:27:02.400
Hmm.

01:27:02.402 --> 01:27:05.003
On second thought, that is pretty
impressive. Admire me accordingly.

01:27:11.177 --> 01:27:14.947
Well, as Mary Poppins and a
paraphrased Jesus once said,

01:27:16.183 --> 01:27:17.850
"My work here is done."

01:27:19.354 --> 01:27:20.821
Goodbye, Hannah.

01:27:21.956 --> 01:27:22.955
Bye.

01:27:22.957 --> 01:27:25.058
- You're welcome.
- What?

01:27:35.371 --> 01:27:36.869
Hey!

01:27:36.871 --> 01:27:37.770
Oh.

01:27:37.772 --> 01:27:39.905
We wanted to thank him.

01:27:39.907 --> 01:27:41.839
Yeah, well, it'll have to wait.

01:27:41.841 --> 01:27:46.112
He's on to his next adventure. Or whatever.

01:27:46.114 --> 01:27:50.918
He seems different
somehow. Like, I don't know.

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:53.487
Like a big, beautiful condor

01:27:53.489 --> 01:27:57.457
that people will respect and fear.

01:27:57.459 --> 01:28:01.661
"I can't believe that used
to be Stensland," they'll say.

01:28:01.663 --> 01:28:04.899
"I can't believe that
used to be Stensland."

01:28:08.278 --> 01:28:13.278

That is delightful and witty.

01:32:57.875 --> 01:32:59.475
I know.
