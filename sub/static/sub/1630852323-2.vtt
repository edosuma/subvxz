<i>Would you suck a man's toes?</i>

00:22.647 --> 00:23.857
<i>I ain't suckin' no toes.</i>

00:23.940 --> 00:26.568
<i>Like she's gonna tell you</i>
<i>she's sucking somebody's toes.</i>

00:26.651 --> 00:29.279
<i>-[Alexis] Who sucks men's toes?</i>
<i>-[Colony] Anne, you suck toes?</i>

00:29.362 --> 00:30.488
<i>Ew, no!</i>

00:30.572 --> 00:33.700
<i>[Juawana] Anne don't even</i>
<i>eat cold sandwiches. Tennille, would you?</i>

00:33.783 --> 00:37.120
<i>If the price right,</i>
<i>there's a lotta shit I might do.</i>

00:37.203 --> 00:39.205
<i>All money ain't good money, okay?</i>

00:44.919 --> 00:46.254
<i>[all] Hello!</i>

00:46.880 --> 00:48.798
<i>Well, I see somebody made it on time.</i>

00:48.882 --> 00:50.925
<i>Honey, the grind don't stop.</i>

00:51.009 --> 00:53.094
<i>-It does not.</i>
<i>-Okay, legs.</i>

00:53.178 --> 00:54.304
<i>[Anne] I love the shoes.</i>

00:54.387 --> 00:56.806
<i>Fuckin' fabulous,</i>
<i>because I'm fuckin' fabulous.</i>

00:58.391 --> 01:00.977
<i>[Sharelle] It's time for</i>
<i>our meeting, y'all. Come on, let's go.</i>

01:01.061 --> 01:04.939
<i>Don't be tardy for the table.</i>
<i>So everyone had a great time?</i>

01:05.023 --> 01:06.983
<i>-[Rena] Yes, I did.</i>
<i>-[all] Yes, I did! I had fun!</i>

01:07.067 --> 01:08.693
<i>I think the guests enjoyed it too.</i>

01:08.777 --> 01:10.820
<i>[Tennille] I think</i>
<i>everybody had a nice time.</i>

01:10.904 --> 01:12.405
<i>[Sharelle] The event was amazing,</i>

01:12.489 --> 01:15.950
<i>but I'm hoping that we had a buyer</i>
<i>that can get this house under contract.</i>

01:16.034 --> 01:18.078
<i>We need everyone to perform.</i>

01:18.161 --> 01:21.164
<i>[Juawana] Rena, why am I</i>
<i>getting the dirty look?</i>

01:21.247 --> 01:23.166
<i>Why am I gettin' this rinky-dink chair?</i>

01:25.794 --> 01:28.129
<i>[Juawana] I gotta go get my notebook.</i>
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

01:28.213 --> 01:29.714
<i>-Can you get my laptop?</i>
<i>-Yes!</i>

01:29.798 --> 01:31.591
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-Can you get my water?</i>

01:31.674 --> 01:33.176
<i>-Sure.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

01:33.259 --> 01:34.385
<i>Does she ever say no?</i>

01:34.469 --> 01:37.055
<i>So, you ladies,</i>
<i>y'all did amazing last night.</i>

01:37.138 --> 01:41.684
<i>Everybody invited somebody.</i>
<i>Except for the one with a lot of mouth.</i>

01:41.768 --> 01:44.395
<i>-I did invite someone, they didn't come.</i>
<i>-They didn't show up.</i>

01:44.479 --> 01:46.940
<i>It was an invite, not a subpoena.</i>
<i>Anything else?</i>

01:47.023 --> 01:48.066
<i>Yes, participate.</i>

01:48.149 --> 01:51.069
<i>Everybody needs to participate</i>
<i>and make sure their guests come.</i>

01:51.152 --> 01:54.781
<i>But anyway, ladies,</i>
<i>overall, everyone did an amazing job,</i>

01:54.864 --> 01:57.492
<i>but y'all thought this was a club event,</i>
<i>some of y'all.</i>

01:57.575 --> 01:59.244
<i>-Colony.</i>
<i>-[Juawana laughs]</i>

01:59.327 --> 02:00.453
<i>I beg to differ.</i>

02:00.537 --> 02:02.205
<i>-It was short.</i>
<i>-You looked beautiful.</i>

02:02.288 --> 02:04.582
<i>If you sneezed,</i>
<i>you would've seen your butt cheeks.</i>

02:04.666 --> 02:06.209
<i>[all] Ooh!</i>

02:07.460 --> 02:10.505
<i>I actually got a call from</i>
<i>my client Peter earlier today.</i>

02:10.588 --> 02:11.881
<i>-[all exclaim]</i>
<i>-What? Okay!</i>

02:11.965 --> 02:14.217
<i>And we are submitting a--</i>

02:14.300 --> 02:17.303
<i>-"We got a call from Peter."</i>
<i>-No. I got a call from Peter.</i>

02:17.387 --> 02:19.347
<i>But he was excited to hear my voice--</i>

02:19.430 --> 02:23.726
<i>Serious, so, Anne, he's about</i>
<i>to put an offer where, on the property?</i>

02:23.810 --> 02:25.311
<i>-[Rena] Wonderful.</i>
<i>-He's underbidding.</i>

02:25.395 --> 02:28.815
<i>-But that's none of your business.</i>
<i>-I was trying to bring it up.</i>

02:28.898 --> 02:30.733
<i>Anne, Tennille trying to take your client?</i>

02:30.817 --> 02:33.570
<i>Um, from my perspective, it seems so.</i>

02:33.653 --> 02:36.364
<i>He came up to me and said,</i>
<i>"You know the history of Spanish moss?"</i>

02:36.447 --> 02:39.617
<i>-[Anne] Same conversation with everyone.</i>
<i>-But I sold a house to him.</i>

02:39.701 --> 02:42.537
<i>-Well, where's the contract?</i>
<i>-I'm gonna let you write it up.</i>

02:42.620 --> 02:47.417
<i>Anne should give me some of</i>
<i>her commission if Peter signs the deal,</i>

02:47.500 --> 02:50.170
<i>because she was late,</i>
<i>I'm entertaining him,</i>

02:50.253 --> 02:52.505
<i>I had told him all the specs of the house.</i>

02:52.589 --> 02:54.048
<i>That tells you how late she was.</i>

02:54.132 --> 02:56.676
<i>So, I think I need a little cut,</i>

02:56.759 --> 03:00.597
<i>one percent, two percent, dinner.</i>
<i>I need something.</i>

03:01.556 --> 03:04.726
<i>-I'm working on the offer.</i>
<i>-Did he tell you what he wanted to offer?</i>

03:05.310 --> 03:08.396
<i>-It's a bit lower, in the threes.</i>
<i>-[Sharelle] Threes? Anne!</i>

03:08.479 --> 03:11.900
<i>Do you ladies think that</i>
<i>that home is worth $9,000,000?</i>

03:11.983 --> 03:14.152
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-But do you feel like three million is--</i>

03:14.235 --> 03:16.362
<i>I absolutely think that three is low.</i>

03:16.446 --> 03:18.823
<i>-A discount. Half off.</i>
<i>-However, an offer's an offer.</i>

03:18.907 --> 03:22.243
<i>None of the other ladies got in offers.</i>
<i>Three is better than nothing.</i>

03:22.327 --> 03:25.038
<i>We're not here to waste time.</i>
<i>Three million, that's an insult.</i>

03:25.121 --> 03:27.665
<i>We're just using that</i>
<i>to start the conversation.</i>

03:27.749 --> 03:30.752
<i>Anne, this is not a starting conversation.</i>
<i>We have time.</i>

03:30.835 --> 03:32.962
<i>The home is listed for nine million.</i>

03:33.046 --> 03:34.505
<i>It's important to be realistic.</i>

03:34.589 --> 03:38.885
<i>Would you want somebody to offer you</i>
<i>$3,000,000 on a $9,000,000 property?</i>

03:38.968 --> 03:42.305
<i>She's my top producing agent. But today,</i>

03:42.388 --> 03:47.977
<i>she showed me that</i>
<i>she lost everything I taught her.</i>

03:48.061 --> 03:50.855
<i>-Don't come wasting time writing a three--</i>
<i>-I'm not here to waste time.</i>

03:50.939 --> 03:53.524
<i>-I don't like my time being wasted.</i>
<i>-[Karla] I know that's right.</i>

03:54.108 --> 03:57.570
<i>Another thing I want to talk to you about</i>
<i>is the new commission split.</i>

03:57.654 --> 04:01.491
<i>We are growing.</i>
<i>With growth comes changes, so,</i>

04:01.574 --> 04:06.579
<i>effective in 30 days, the commission</i>
<i>will change from a 95-5 to a 80-20.</i>

04:06.663 --> 04:08.498
<i>We will have increased marketing.</i>

04:08.581 --> 04:10.124
<i>We'll have more lead generations,</i>

04:10.208 --> 04:12.877
<i>and we have better software</i>
<i>to help with the company.</i>

04:12.961 --> 04:15.463
<i>I'm taking home less,</i>
<i>and the brokerage is taking more.</i>

04:15.546 --> 04:19.425
<i>I get it, at the end of the day,</i>
<i>it's a company and it needs to run.</i>

04:19.509 --> 04:21.844
<i>But for me it's a problem, particularly</i>

04:21.928 --> 04:24.639
<i>when I feel I've been</i>
<i>excluded from the marketing photo.</i>

04:24.722 --> 04:26.516
<i>Let's say Rena sold a $1,000,000Â home.</i>

04:26.599 --> 04:28.851
<i>Juawana, tell everybody</i>
<i>how that breaks down.</i>

04:28.935 --> 04:29.811
<i>Absolutely.</i>

04:29.894 --> 04:32.647
<i>On the former structure, 95-5,</i>

04:32.730 --> 04:36.484
<i>if we had a million-dollar sale</i>
<i>and it was a 3% commission,</i>

04:36.567 --> 04:39.862
<i>the agent would get $28,500.</i>

04:39.946 --> 04:44.492
<i>With the new commission split,</i>
<i>the agent will get 24,000.</i>

04:45.076 --> 04:47.078
<i>Anybody have questions,</i>
<i>comments or concerns?</i>

04:50.748 --> 04:55.044
<i>I do. Why would you be changing</i>
<i>the commission split now?</i>

04:55.128 --> 04:57.922
<i>Like I said before, we're growing</i>
<i>and we do have a lot--</i>

04:58.006 --> 04:59.716
<i>"We're growing," what do you mean?</i>

04:59.799 --> 05:02.176
<i>We're getting new systems,</i>
<i>lead generation--</i>

05:02.260 --> 05:05.680
<i>So we're paying 15% more</i>
<i>of our commissions to the brokerage.</i>

05:05.763 --> 05:06.681
<i>Correct.</i>

05:06.764 --> 05:08.891
<i>This is the second time</i>
<i>our split has changed.</i>

05:08.975 --> 05:09.934
<i>Correct.</i>

05:10.018 --> 05:12.520
<i>When can we count on</i>
<i>it not changing any further?</i>

05:12.603 --> 05:16.274
<i>I mean, I rely on this</i>
<i>'cause this is my livelihood,</i>

05:16.357 --> 05:17.900
<i>and my pay keeps changing,</i>

05:17.984 --> 05:21.446
<i>but I'm using the same services and</i>
<i>working just as hard as when I came here.</i>

05:21.529 --> 05:23.656
<i>Are you in the same seat</i>
<i>when you first came in?</i>

05:23.740 --> 05:26.784
<i>No, but our transaction fees</i>
<i>have changed too, and that covers that.</i>

05:26.868 --> 05:30.455
<i>-You think it covers expenses?</i>
<i>-Our brokerage system has stayed the same.</i>

05:30.538 --> 05:33.583
<i>The lead generation you're talking about,</i>
<i>which is non-existent, is the same.</i>

05:33.666 --> 05:36.127
<i>-We pay insurance--</i>
<i>-You never got a lead from me?</i>

05:36.210 --> 05:37.712
<i>How many leads have you given me?</i>

05:37.795 --> 05:40.131
<i>-When you first came here--</i>
<i>-I'm gonna say five.</i>

05:40.214 --> 05:41.466
<i>-Yes, that's amazing!</i>
<i>-Five!</i>

05:41.549 --> 05:43.384
<i>-[Sharelle] And they all closed, right?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

05:43.468 --> 05:45.178
<i>-Two closed.</i>
<i>-You sound ungrateful.</i>

05:45.261 --> 05:47.472
<i>-I'm not ungrateful. I--</i>
<i>-Becauseâ¦</i>

05:47.555 --> 05:49.557
<i>I don't have time to go into this, Rena,</i>

05:49.640 --> 05:52.268
<i>but you can get on my calendar,</i>
<i>and we can discuss it more.</i>

05:52.352 --> 05:54.145
<i>["Icy" by Sharde playing]</i>

06:10.244 --> 06:12.163
<i>[Sharelle] You ready</i>
<i>to get this workout in?</i>

06:12.246 --> 06:14.916
<i>-I haven't done a workout in so long.</i>
<i>-You still look good.</i>

06:14.999 --> 06:16.209
<i>Thank you, I'm trying.</i>

06:16.292 --> 06:19.462
<i>I see you, I see you.</i>
<i>I've been working on my diet, girl.</i>

06:19.545 --> 06:21.798
<i>I'm on a seafood diet.</i>
<i>I see it and I eat it.</i>

06:21.881 --> 06:22.715
<i>[Karla] All of it.</i>

06:22.799 --> 06:24.884
<i>-[Sharelle] Hey, Glenn!</i>
<i>-Afternoon, ladies.</i>

06:24.967 --> 06:27.470
<i>-Ready to get this workout in?</i>
<i>-I'm ready if you ready.</i>

06:27.553 --> 06:28.721
<i>[all laughing]</i>

06:28.805 --> 06:30.890
<i>-Karla. I was telling you about her.</i>
<i>-[Karla] Hi.</i>

06:30.973 --> 06:32.850
<i>-[both] Nice to meet you.</i>
<i>-The workout queen.</i>

06:32.934 --> 06:34.811
<i>She thinks she's the best workout person.</i>

06:34.894 --> 06:36.062
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

06:36.145 --> 06:39.899
<i>[Glenn] TLC. Tender loving care.</i>
<i>Let's get it. 30 seconds of work.</i>

<i>-Summer bodies, come on.</i>

06:41.692 --> 06:43.277
<i>I kinda wanna get into it with you.</i>

06:43.361 --> 06:45.696

<i>-[Sharelle] Come on, Glenn.</i>

06:45.780 --> 06:47.782
<i>-I feel the burn, Glenn.</i>
<i>-Three. Two.</i>

06:47.865 --> 06:50.410
<i>Shit! I didn't sign up for this.</i>

<i>[Glenn chuckles]</i>

<i>Just thinkin' about my bed.</i>

<i>[Glenn] Finish strong, come on.</i>
<i>I need those turbines.</i>

<i>Let's go.</i>

06:59.877 --> 07:02.755
<i>-It's always a competition.</i>
<i>-[Karla laughs] Now this is fun.</i>

07:02.839 --> 07:04.215
<i>[Glenn] No, who got it?</i>

07:04.298 --> 07:06.300
<i>-Almost there. Five seconds.</i>
<i>-[Sharelle] Come on.</i>

07:06.384 --> 07:09.178
<i>Three. Two. One. Slow it down.</i>

<i>You guys are done.</i>

<i>-Oh, my God.</i>
<i>-We're done.</i>

07:18.563 --> 07:20.064
<i>[Glenn] You're done. Get that water.</i>

07:20.148 --> 07:23.317
<i>[in Spanish] Let's get out of here.</i>
<i>Thanks a lot. And bye.</i>

07:23.401 --> 07:25.111
<i>[Glenn in English] Behave, y'all.</i>

07:25.194 --> 07:28.281
<i>I'll take care of cleaning up.</i>
<i>Don't forget your phone and keys, though.</i>

07:28.906 --> 07:32.660
<i>[Sharelle] We're gonna sit here</i>
<i>and recover before we head out.</i>

07:32.743 --> 07:34.537
<i>-[Glenn] Recover a little bit.</i>
<i>-We're good.</i>

07:34.620 --> 07:37.123
<i>-All right.</i>
<i>-[Sharelle] So, I'm glad we got together.</i>

07:37.206 --> 07:38.499
<i>-I appreciate that.</i>
<i>-Becauseâ¦</i>

07:38.583 --> 07:42.587
<i>Karla is an amazing person,</i>
<i>but she's not focused.</i>

07:42.670 --> 07:46.716
<i>I know she can produce,</i>
<i>and I need to see why she's not producing.</i>

07:47.300 --> 07:50.344
<i>I know you, and I know</i>
<i>you started performing good.</i>

07:50.428 --> 07:53.139
<i>-And then it just--</i>
<i>-Stopped.</i>

07:53.222 --> 07:54.056
<i>Oh, I know.</i>

07:54.140 --> 07:56.309
<i>-Now I'm like, "Damn, what the fuck?"</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

07:56.392 --> 08:00.646
<i>So you haven't been the Karla that I know.</i>
<i>I know you been through a lot.</i>

08:01.314 --> 08:03.608
<i>Before the pandemic, everything was great.</i>

08:03.691 --> 08:06.110
<i>The old Karla is the life of the party.</i>

08:06.194 --> 08:07.195
<i>I'm Latina.</i>

08:07.278 --> 08:08.571
<i>I love my kids.</i>

08:08.654 --> 08:11.407
<i>But life threw me some curveballs,</i>
<i>and everything changed.</i>

08:11.491 --> 08:15.536
<i>Pandemic came, it slowed down</i>
<i>my business, half of my clients fell off,</i>

08:15.620 --> 08:18.706
<i>and then I broke up</i>
<i>with my high school sweetheart.</i>

08:18.789 --> 08:20.583
<i>We were together for ten years.</i>

08:20.666 --> 08:22.376
<i>It really put me in a dark place,</i>

08:22.460 --> 08:26.130
<i>and I'll say that's when</i>
<i>I realized what depression was.</i>

08:26.214 --> 08:27.465
<i>That's when I understood.</i>

08:29.175 --> 08:33.179
<i>I went through depression too,</i>
<i>even in the military, PTSD.</i>

08:33.262 --> 08:36.933
<i>It was a lot,</i>
<i>and I had a lot of anger built up.</i>

08:37.016 --> 08:39.727
<i>I felt nobody could relate</i>
<i>to what I was going through.</i>

08:39.810 --> 08:41.229
<i>-Right.</i>
<i>-Soâ¦</i>

08:42.063 --> 08:46.192
<i>My first time going to a therapist</i>
<i>I was likeâ¦ I basically cussed her out.</i>

08:46.275 --> 08:49.237
<i>"You don't know what the fuck</i>
<i>I've been through!" I stopped going.</i>

08:49.320 --> 08:51.781
<i>Then when my daughter told me,</i>
<i>"You changed,</i>

08:51.864 --> 08:54.116
<i>you're not the same mother</i>
<i>that you were before."</i>

08:54.200 --> 08:55.451
<i>-That hurts.</i>
<i>-It hurts.</i>

08:55.535 --> 08:57.787
<i>-And it makes you want to go get help.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

08:57.870 --> 08:59.789
<i>So I went back and I got help,</i>

08:59.872 --> 09:02.083
<i>and I feel like</i>
<i>that's what you should try.</i>

09:02.166 --> 09:04.627
<i>Just give it a chance,</i>
<i>and you willÂ see a better you.</i>

09:04.710 --> 09:08.589
<i>You know, I'm sad about everything,</i>
<i>but my priority is the kids,</i>

09:08.673 --> 09:10.508
<i>and there is no giving up.</i>

09:10.591 --> 09:12.927
<i>I know I'm not producing</i>
<i>as much as you want.</i>

09:13.010 --> 09:16.556
<i>And I know you know my numbers</i>
<i>and you know what I've done.</i>

09:16.639 --> 09:19.016
<i>Well, I want you to know, Karla,</i>

09:19.100 --> 09:22.770
<i>you're gonna</i>
<i>come see this development siteâ¦</i>

09:22.853 --> 09:24.772
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-â¦with me, Juawana, and Arturo.</i>

09:24.855 --> 09:25.856
<i>[exclaims]</i>

09:25.940 --> 09:28.317
<i>[Sharelle] Striking a deal</i>
<i>with a developer like Arturo</i>

09:28.401 --> 09:30.570
<i>is definitely gonna put Allure on the map.</i>

09:30.653 --> 09:32.113
<i>[Arturo] You got a deal.</i>

09:32.196 --> 09:34.156
<i>[Sharelle] He's one of</i>
<i>the best builders in Tampa,</i>

09:34.240 --> 09:37.618
<i>and he has multi-million-dollar</i>
<i>properties with big clients,</i>

09:37.702 --> 09:38.911
<i>which leads to big money.</i>

09:38.995 --> 09:41.706
<i>I know you need</i>
<i>that little pep in your step.</i>

09:41.789 --> 09:42.873
<i>I know you can do it.</i>

09:42.957 --> 09:45.626
<i>It's gonna be a big deal for you.</i>

09:45.710 --> 09:50.214
<i>It's gonna help you, and we think</i>
<i>that you would do great with this project.</i>

09:50.881 --> 09:52.133
<i>How do you feel about that?</i>

09:52.216 --> 09:54.260
<i>For you to bring me on,</i>

09:54.343 --> 09:55.970
<i>it's definitely, like, an honor.</i>

09:56.053 --> 09:59.432
<i>It feels so powerful. It feels good.</i>

09:59.515 --> 10:03.394
<i>It's almost like a real</i>
<i>motivational push that I needed.</i>

10:03.477 --> 10:04.812
<i>And we all need that.</i>

10:04.895 --> 10:06.439
<i>-That's all I needed.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

10:06.522 --> 10:09.525
<i>It is hard for me to talk to Sharelle</i>
<i>about what I have going on.</i>

10:09.609 --> 10:11.902
<i>Sharelle's seen my numbers,</i>
<i>knows what I can do.</i>

10:11.986 --> 10:15.656
<i>And I want her to understand,</i>
<i>but I sometimes feel like</i>

10:15.740 --> 10:18.034
<i>Sharelle might look at you</i>
<i>like you're justâ¦</i>

10:18.117 --> 10:20.578
<i>"It's all excuses,"</i>
<i>and it's not, it's life.</i>

10:20.661 --> 10:23.247
<i>So I want to show her</i>
<i>that I'm not going nowhere.</i>

10:23.331 --> 10:25.958
<i>It was just a little hiccup in my life,</i>
<i>and I'm back.</i>

10:26.042 --> 10:28.502
<i>I'm about my money, so that's for sure.</i>

10:29.211 --> 10:31.339
<i>-You will be proud.</i>
<i>-I got faith in you, girl.</i>

10:31.422 --> 10:33.841
<i>-You're gonna be so proud, boo.</i>
<i>-[both laugh]</i>

10:33.924 --> 10:36.927
<i>You better.</i>
<i>Don't be having me look bad now, Karla.</i>

10:37.011 --> 10:38.179
<i>No, I don't want that.</i>

10:39.138 --> 10:41.557
<i>âª Yoo-hoo!</i>
<i>I sparkle in these streetsÂ âª</i>

10:41.641 --> 10:43.726
<i>âª Necks twist every time you see meÂ âª</i>

10:44.560 --> 10:47.480
<i>âª Magic, I'm magic, I'm magicalÂ âª</i>

10:48.648 --> 10:52.401
<i>[Colony] This house is beautiful, Anne.</i>
<i>I love how it's staged over here.</i>

10:52.485 --> 10:55.738
<i>[Anne] And right at the entrance</i>
<i>is actually a game room.</i>

10:55.821 --> 11:00.117
<i>A new buyer could potentially</i>
<i>make it, like, an office or a study.</i>

11:00.201 --> 11:03.245
<i>It's a flex space. So you can do</i>
<i>whatever you want to do with it.</i>

11:03.329 --> 11:06.040
<i>I've never really seen</i>
<i>a game room right at the entrance.</i>

11:06.123 --> 11:08.584
<i>-So that's different. I like it.</i>
<i>-It's normally hidden.</i>

11:08.668 --> 11:10.920
<i>It's kind of like,</i>
<i>"Welcome to the playhouse."</i>

11:11.003 --> 11:12.546
<i>[both chuckling]</i>

11:12.630 --> 11:15.341
<i>All right, so let's go</i>
<i>check out this chef's kitchen.</i>

11:16.509 --> 11:17.885
<i>[Colony] It's almost picturesque.</i>

11:17.968 --> 11:21.389
<i>[Anne] This kitchen is not only beautiful,</i>
<i>but super functional.</i>

11:21.472 --> 11:24.975
<i>-[Colony] I love this over-sized island.</i>
<i>-Isn't it beautiful?</i>

11:25.059 --> 11:30.940
<i>So it's an over-sized quartz island</i>
<i>with a porcelain farmhouse sink.</i>

11:31.023 --> 11:33.859
<i>One of the things I enjoy</i>
<i>is the flow of the home. Right?</i>

11:33.943 --> 11:37.780
<i>Five bedroom, four bath,</i>
<i>right above 5,100 square feet.</i>

11:37.863 --> 11:38.698
<i>[Colony] Okay.</i>

11:38.781 --> 11:41.325
<i>But it doesn't feel like</i>
<i>you're in a huge home.</i>

11:41.409 --> 11:42.743
<i>-Right?</i>
<i>-It feels very homey.</i>

11:42.827 --> 11:44.537
<i>But I mean, it does have the space.</i>

11:44.620 --> 11:47.039
<i>-Exactly. It's not small.</i>
<i>-This isn't a small home.</i>

11:47.123 --> 11:51.419
<i>-I like it. And the beams.</i>
<i>-Yes, beautiful beam details.</i>

11:51.502 --> 11:53.504
<i>[upbeat music playing]</i>

11:54.380 --> 11:56.215
<i>[Anne] Let's check out the owner's suite.</i>

11:57.758 --> 12:00.720
<i>This is very pretty.</i>
<i>I love the entrance to the outside.</i>

12:00.803 --> 12:04.432
<i>And all the small details,</i>
<i>the tray ceilings.</i>

12:04.515 --> 12:07.518
<i>Of course, what's an owner's suite</i>
<i>without a good bathroom?</i>

12:07.601 --> 12:11.397
<i>There's that trend again,</i>
<i>the tub is in the shower. I love that.</i>

12:11.480 --> 12:13.065
<i>[Anne] Three different shower heads.</i>

12:13.149 --> 12:16.444
<i>-And enough space for a whole party.</i>
<i>-I know, girl.</i>

12:16.527 --> 12:19.029
<i>-[Colony] I love the landscaping.</i>
<i>-How beautiful.</i>

12:19.113 --> 12:22.575
<i>You have a covered lanai, a pool and spa.</i>

12:22.658 --> 12:24.660
<i>This is a gem. The home sells itself.</i>

12:24.744 --> 12:26.704
<i>The area's great. You have great schools.</i>

12:26.787 --> 12:28.164
<i>Well, I think you got it.</i>

12:28.247 --> 12:31.584
<i>All right, well, you ready to head out?</i>

12:33.169 --> 12:34.879
<i>Such a beautiful day.</i>

12:34.962 --> 12:36.964
<i>It's entirely too hot.</i>

12:37.047 --> 12:40.676
<i>-[Anne] Can you think of any buyers?</i>
<i>-This could be good for my client Cho.</i>

12:40.760 --> 12:42.386
<i>Exactly. We could keep it in-house.</i>

12:42.470 --> 12:43.846
<i>-Absolutely.</i>
<i>-Bring them a buyer.</i>

12:43.929 --> 12:45.848
<i>We don't have to be</i>
<i>on the market for long.</i>

12:45.931 --> 12:48.100
<i>Don't have to let people</i>
<i>walk through your home.</i>

12:48.184 --> 12:50.394
<i>-[Colony] Right.</i>
<i>-Make this short and sweet.</i>

12:50.478 --> 12:53.105
<i>Quick and easy.</i>
<i>This'll be a nice check, girl.</i>

12:53.189 --> 12:54.648
<i>Let me check the commission.</i>

12:54.732 --> 12:58.903
<i>So, starting at two million</i>
<i>times 3% commissionâ¦</i>

12:58.986 --> 13:01.655
<i>-Let me not forget about the new split.</i>
<i>-[Colony] The new split.</i>

13:01.739 --> 13:04.909
<i>-80-20.</i>
<i>-Okay. Times 80% for me.</i>

13:04.992 --> 13:07.036
<i>-What's that?</i>
<i>-$48,000.</i>

13:07.119 --> 13:09.371
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-And the rest for Sharelle.</i>

13:09.455 --> 13:12.500
<i>-Allure Realty.</i>
<i>-Allure Realty. Yeah. Excuse me.</i>

13:12.583 --> 13:16.170
<i>-[laughing]</i>
<i>-That's crazy. Coming from like a 95-5â¦</i>

13:16.253 --> 13:17.838
<i>It's pretty steep.</i>

13:17.922 --> 13:19.507
<i>-Pretty steep.</i>
<i>-It's a big jump.</i>

13:19.590 --> 13:24.345
<i>To be honest, you won't feel the split if</i>
<i>you're out here hustling, closing deals.</i>

13:24.428 --> 13:26.847
<i>It'd help if the other ladies</i>
<i>helped her make money.</i>

13:26.931 --> 13:29.016
<i>-Because we wouldn't be here.</i>
<i>-That's true.</i>

13:29.099 --> 13:31.977
<i>Me and you can't carry</i>
<i>this whole brokerage. We're hustling.</i>

13:32.061 --> 13:33.896
<i>-Right.</i>
<i>-Like, "Come on, ladies."</i>

13:33.979 --> 13:36.106
<i>"Y'all need to be producing, make money,</i>

13:36.190 --> 13:38.108
<i>because 80% of zero is gonna be zero."</i>

13:38.192 --> 13:41.153
<i>-I guess we paying the bills. [laughs]</i>
<i>-We paying the bills.</i>

13:41.237 --> 13:44.782
<i>But I'm not worried about that.</i>
<i>I got other things to worry about.</i>

13:44.865 --> 13:48.577
<i>So do you think that Rena's approach</i>
<i>to Sharelle was a bit much?</i>

13:48.661 --> 13:50.788
<i>I agree with Rena on certain things,</i>

13:50.871 --> 13:54.083
<i>but as far as the commission,</i>
<i>I'm cool with it. I have no issues.</i>

13:54.166 --> 13:57.419
<i>-That's a Rena thing. I don't understand.</i>
<i>-It's not the way we operate.</i>

13:57.503 --> 13:59.922
<i>-Yeah, no. I can't.</i>
<i>-I can't.</i>

14:00.005 --> 14:02.842
<i>Rena always likes to be right.</i>
<i>Sharelle likes to be right.</i>

14:02.925 --> 14:07.805
<i>When you have two people that like to be</i>
<i>right trying to get their points across,</i>

14:07.888 --> 14:08.806
<i>doesn't end well.</i>

14:08.889 --> 14:11.725
<i>-I need to go to the office.</i>
<i>-Let's go, 'cause I'm hot, girl.</i>

14:11.809 --> 14:15.521
<i>I'm sweating. I gotta get out this blazer.</i>
<i>My feet hurt. I gotta get out this sun.</i>

14:15.604 --> 14:18.190
<i>-You know, chocolate melts, honey.</i>
<i>-So does caramel.</i>

14:18.274 --> 14:20.526
<i>[Colony] Yeah,</i>
<i>but caramel's kind of sticky.</i>

14:20.609 --> 14:23.779
<i>-[Anne] Girl! You're so annoying.</i>
<i>-[both laughing]</i>

14:24.780 --> 14:26.782
<i>[upbeat music playing]</i>

14:32.162 --> 14:34.290
<i>I see a table right over here</i>
<i>we can sit at.</i>

14:34.957 --> 14:37.668
<i>-[waitress] Hi, how are you?</i>
<i>-[Andrikk] Doing well, how about you?</i>

14:37.751 --> 14:40.629
<i>My name is Megan.</i>
<i>I'll be taking care of you this afternoon.</i>

14:40.713 --> 14:43.299
<i>-[Andrikk] Thank you, Megan.</i>
<i>-What can I get you guys to drink?</i>

14:43.382 --> 14:45.009
<i>[Rena] I'm gonna have an old fashioned.</i>

14:45.092 --> 14:48.012
<i>-I'm an old-fashioned person too.</i>
<i>-Sounds good. Back in a moment.</i>

14:48.095 --> 14:49.722
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-Thank you, Megan.</i>

14:49.805 --> 14:51.223
<i>What's been going on with you?</i>

14:51.307 --> 14:55.144
<i>You know, I've been really thinking</i>
<i>about starting my own company,</i>

14:55.227 --> 14:57.855
<i>and I'm pretty serious about it.</i>

14:57.938 --> 14:58.772
<i>Okay.</i>

14:58.856 --> 15:02.443
<i>You remember when</i>
<i>Sharelle first started Allure Realty?</i>

15:03.152 --> 15:06.822
<i>I felt like I was</i>
<i>an integral part of the brokerage.</i>

15:07.615 --> 15:12.161
<i>And lately I feel like</i>
<i>I'm on the outside looking in.</i>

15:12.745 --> 15:16.457
<i>I think it's time for you and Sharelle</i>
<i>to sit down and have a conversation.</i>

15:16.540 --> 15:19.919
<i>Let her know what's troubling you.</i>
<i>She respects you enough for that.</i>

15:20.002 --> 15:23.464
<i>I have talked to Sharelle</i>
<i>about some of these issues, andâ¦</i>

15:23.547 --> 15:26.216
<i>It's still the</i>
<i>"It's my way or the highway."</i>

15:26.300 --> 15:31.180
<i>It feels like, what's the benefit of</i>
<i>gaining the world if you lose your soul?</i>

15:31.263 --> 15:35.559
<i>If I'm just not happy working there</i>
<i>because I don't feel my opinion is valued</i>

15:35.643 --> 15:38.812
<i>and I feel like I kind of</i>
<i>have to quiet down who I amâ¦</i>

15:40.105 --> 15:41.982
<i>Is that really the place for me?</i>

15:42.066 --> 15:45.069
<i>People very rarely leave jobs</i>
<i>because they don't make enough money.</i>

15:45.694 --> 15:48.030
<i>They leave when they</i>
<i>feel like they're undervalued.</i>

15:48.113 --> 15:49.907
<i>[Rena] When Sharelle and her ex split up,</i>

15:49.990 --> 15:53.410
<i>we had this conundrum of,</i>
<i>"Do I have to choose one or the other?"</i>

15:53.494 --> 15:57.790
<i>I'm better friends with Sharelle,</i>
<i>Andrikk's good friends with Sharelle's ex.</i>

15:57.873 --> 16:01.418
<i>And so I do think</i>
<i>our friendship has been affected.</i>

16:01.502 --> 16:04.380
<i>It's hard not to take things</i>
<i>personal sometimes.</i>

16:04.463 --> 16:07.174
<i>I guess that it's hard</i>
<i>because she's a friend,</i>

16:07.257 --> 16:09.176
<i>you know, and at the end of the day,</i>

16:09.885 --> 16:12.638
<i>I would like to remain friends.</i>

16:13.973 --> 16:16.767
<i>But the market is fantastic right now,</i>

16:16.850 --> 16:20.980
<i>and I do feel like I'm at a space where</i>
<i>I'm starting to get the referrals,</i>

16:21.063 --> 16:24.942
<i>and I'm starting to really, kind of,</i>
<i>make my name in the market.</i>

16:25.025 --> 16:26.527
<i>[Andrikk] And part of that may be,</i>

16:26.610 --> 16:29.613
<i>being a young business owner,</i>
<i>she may see some of thatÂ as a threat.</i>

16:29.697 --> 16:32.574
<i>I have my broker's license,</i>
<i>but Sharelle doesn't know yet.</i>

16:32.658 --> 16:35.160
<i>And the difference between</i>
<i>an agent and a broker</i>

16:35.244 --> 16:37.162
<i>is a broker can open up their own office,</i>

16:37.246 --> 16:39.415
<i>and that presents</i>
<i>a lot of opportunities for me.</i>

16:39.999 --> 16:42.001
<i>Who would you take with you from the team?</i>

16:42.084 --> 16:46.672
<i>If I recruited some agents that</i>
<i>are there currently, that would be, umâ¦</i>

16:47.256 --> 16:48.215
<i>war.</i>

16:48.298 --> 16:49.299
<i>[chuckling]</i>

16:49.383 --> 16:52.553
<i>âª Yeah, you don't want things to get ugly</i>
<i>It's like y'all want somethin' from me âª</i>

16:52.636 --> 16:55.639
<i>âª Popping off at the mouth</i>
<i>I guess your memory fuzzyÂ âª</i>

16:55.723 --> 16:58.684
<i>âª Things seem like it's sweet</i>
<i>But, no, I ain't your buddyÂ âª</i>

16:58.767 --> 17:01.937
<i>âª No, you won't see it coming</i>
<i>No, you won't see it comingÂ âª</i>

17:03.522 --> 17:05.733
<i>-[Karla] Arturo!</i>
<i>-[Juawana] This is nice.</i>

17:05.816 --> 17:07.151
<i>Hello!</i>

17:07.234 --> 17:10.070
<i>-[Karla] Don't you look mighty spiffy?</i>
<i>-Well, you too.</i>

17:10.154 --> 17:12.781
<i>-[Karla in Spanish] Hello, how are you?</i>
<i>-Hello, how are you?</i>

17:12.865 --> 17:15.951
<i>-What a nice change in languages.</i>
<i>-Yes!</i>

17:16.577 --> 17:19.997
<i>[in English] Welcome to the Verona model</i>
<i>in Stone Lake Ranch.</i>

17:20.080 --> 17:21.081
<i>[Karla] Nice.</i>

17:21.165 --> 17:24.835
<i>Stone Lake Ranch is a gated community</i>
<i>with all the bells and whistles.</i>

17:24.918 --> 17:28.589
<i>You have acres out there,</i>
<i>and you can build as big as you want.</i>

17:28.672 --> 17:30.758
<i>And you're still surrounded by water.</i>

17:30.841 --> 17:33.761
<i>All of the names I have</i>
<i>in all of our models are Italian names.</i>

17:33.844 --> 17:36.263
<i>-You gotta add one more model, "Sharelle."</i>
<i>-[all laughing]</i>

17:36.346 --> 17:39.600
<i>-That would be the most exotic house.</i>
<i>-[Sharelle] Yeah!</i>

17:39.683 --> 17:41.935
<i>-[in Spanish] And Karla too.</i>
<i>-And Karla too.</i>

17:42.019 --> 17:43.062
<i>[all laughing]</i>

17:43.145 --> 17:45.606
<i>[in English] Let's look how this house</i>
<i>is going to be placed.</i>

17:45.689 --> 17:49.068
<i>[Sharelle] All right, y'all, if we</i>
<i>see a gator, remember to run zig-zag.</i>

17:49.151 --> 17:52.237
<i>-Sharelle, we're not gonna see a gator.</i>
<i>-Arturo, how do you know?</i>

<i>-[Anne] Good for you!</i>
<i>-[Colony] Congratulations, Karla.</i>

26:40.390 --> 26:42.183
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-That's good for you.</i>

26:42.267 --> 26:45.729
<i>This deal with Arturo is huge for Allure.</i>
<i>I mean, it really is.</i>

26:45.812 --> 26:47.981
<i>It could really put us on the map.</i>

26:48.064 --> 26:50.150
<i>But it almost feels like</i>
<i>it's a distraction</i>

26:50.233 --> 26:53.236
<i>from the fact thatÂ Sharelle</i>
<i>just changed the commission on us</i>

26:53.320 --> 26:55.071
<i>and didn't talk to us beforehand.</i>

26:55.155 --> 26:58.825
<i>So does it include the brokerage or did</i>
<i>you just come here to rub it in our face?</i>

26:58.908 --> 27:00.410
<i>No, I didn't rub it in your face.</i>

27:00.493 --> 27:02.871
<i>So when I say,</i>
<i>you know, I brought Karla in,</i>

27:02.954 --> 27:07.208
<i>he authorized us</i>
<i>exclusive listings to all his homes.</i>

27:07.292 --> 27:10.253
<i>All of you are able</i>
<i>to market all of his material.</i>

27:10.337 --> 27:12.797
<i>Y'all could've invited us</i>
<i>on the boat to celebrate with you.</i>

27:13.506 --> 27:16.635
<i>Rena tests my authority</i>
<i>and gets up under my skin because</i>

27:16.718 --> 27:18.970
<i>she debates everything,</i>
<i>wants to know everything.</i>

27:19.054 --> 27:22.599
<i>I'm trying to understand why</i>
<i>these decisions are made. They affect me.</i>

27:22.682 --> 27:23.642
<i>They affect my pay.</i>

27:23.725 --> 27:26.811
<i>I thought other agents may have</i>
<i>questions about or issues with it.</i>

27:26.895 --> 27:28.396
<i>So, I'm raising the issue.</i>

27:28.480 --> 27:31.691
<i>Does anyone have a problem</i>
<i>with the commissions?</i>

27:31.775 --> 27:34.110
<i>I have a problem</i>
<i>with the commission changing</i>

27:34.194 --> 27:35.737
<i>on such a frequent basis.</i>

27:35.820 --> 27:37.822
<i>That I have concerns about.</i>

27:37.906 --> 27:40.533
<i>You said other agents</i>
<i>have problems with it.</i>

27:40.617 --> 27:43.161
<i>I've raised the issues in case</i>
<i>anybody else has issues.</i>

27:43.244 --> 27:46.164
<i>-I thought maybe other people--</i>
<i>-[Tennille] You thought or they did?</i>

27:46.247 --> 27:49.042
<i>[Rena] I thought agents may have</i>
<i>questions or have issues with it.</i>

27:49.125 --> 27:50.752
<i>So I'm raising the issue.</i>

27:50.835 --> 27:53.171
<i>If I lay it out there,</i>
<i>this is what's going on.</i>

27:54.005 --> 27:56.716
<i>That's it. There's no more</i>
<i>discussion that needs to be said.</i>

27:56.800 --> 27:59.052
<i>That's what you're saying.</i>
<i>"Don't question it."</i>

27:59.135 --> 28:02.138
<i>If you don't like it, I'm not holding</i>
<i>a gun to your head to stay.</i>

28:02.222 --> 28:03.390
<i>No, you're not.</i>

28:05.058 --> 28:05.975
<i>I meanâ¦</i>

28:07.268 --> 28:08.311
<i>You got something to say?</i>

28:08.395 --> 28:10.980
<i>When you, like, shut down,</i>
<i>it's not team building.</i>

28:11.064 --> 28:14.192
<i>If someone got questions, they should</i>
<i>be allowed to ask the question.</i>

28:14.275 --> 28:15.318
<i>They can ask.</i>

28:15.402 --> 28:18.571
<i>It's a problem when you come to me</i>
<i>and say "other agents."</i>

28:18.655 --> 28:20.198
<i>You have a problem with it.</i>

28:23.410 --> 28:25.620
<i>[Juawana] No, I'll tell you who spoke up</i>
<i>because I saw it.</i>

28:25.704 --> 28:29.082
<i>So, when you asked the question,</i>
<i>Anne had a issue with it.</i>

28:29.666 --> 28:32.419
<i>-I didn't, no, I didn'tâ¦</i>
<i>-[Juawana] I literally saw you.</i>

28:32.502 --> 28:35.463
<i>Maybe I was looking, and agreeing,</i>
<i>and, like, nodding. No.</i>

28:36.047 --> 28:37.632
<i>[Juawana] She asked a question.</i>

28:37.716 --> 28:39.968
<i>No, no, no, but did you see me say,</i>
<i>"Yes, Sharelle"?</i>

28:40.051 --> 28:42.512
<i>Me nodding is not me saying yes,Â Juawana.</i>

28:42.595 --> 28:43.638
<i>What does nodding mean?</i>

28:43.722 --> 28:45.515
<i>Me nodding, that's how I listen.</i>

28:45.598 --> 28:46.975
<i>I actively listen.</i>

28:47.058 --> 28:48.601
<i>Maybe you should try that. Okay?</i>

28:48.685 --> 28:51.354
<i>I never said I specifically had</i>
<i>a problem with commission.</i>

28:51.438 --> 28:53.815
<i>Don't speak on things</i>
<i>that you don't know about.</i>

28:54.315 --> 28:57.152
<i>Body language is a lot,</i>
<i>but you read it wrong.</i>

28:57.235 --> 28:59.279
<i>-[Sharelle] I don't have to detailâ¦</i>
<i>-Stop nodding.</i>

28:59.362 --> 29:01.156
<i>â¦why I'm changing the commission.</i>

29:01.239 --> 29:03.158
<i>We got the nodding police over there.</i>

29:03.241 --> 29:06.369
<i>I work very hard</i>
<i>to make money for this brokerage.</i>

29:06.453 --> 29:11.124
<i>So I consider us not low-level employees.</i>
<i>I consider us like executives, right?</i>

29:11.207 --> 29:13.251
<i>-[Sharelle] Correct.</i>
<i>-We're here building for you too.</i>

29:13.334 --> 29:16.171
<i>You're basically saying,</i>
<i>"I'm lowering all of your pay."</i>

29:16.254 --> 29:18.757
<i>"I don't want questions about it."</i>
<i>I have a concern.</i>

29:18.840 --> 29:21.050
<i>Karla, do you have</i>
<i>a problem with the commission?</i>

29:21.134 --> 29:22.427
<i>Do what you need to do.</i>

29:22.510 --> 29:25.054
<i>-Alexis, do you have a problem?</i>
<i>-I don't.</i>

29:25.138 --> 29:26.431
<i>I don't have no problem.</i>

29:26.514 --> 29:27.766
<i>No, ma'am.</i>

29:27.849 --> 29:30.518
<i>I'm not going to change</i>
<i>how I'm doing things. Period.</i>

29:31.686 --> 29:33.438
<i>Well, there you go, Rena.</i>

29:33.521 --> 29:35.190
<i>I hope you ladies can respect that.</i>

29:35.273 --> 29:38.401
<i>If y'all produced more,</i>
<i>maybe the fees wouldn't be where they are.</i>

29:38.485 --> 29:41.738
<i>So do not tell me how to run my business.</i>

29:42.822 --> 29:44.449
<i>[Sharelle] Girl, that was crazy.</i>

29:44.532 --> 29:45.492
<i>It was.</i>

29:46.659 --> 29:49.496
<i>It's something else to be like,</i>
<i>"It's my way or the highway,"</i>

29:49.579 --> 29:50.914
<i>and not take anyâ¦</i>

29:50.997 --> 29:54.042
<i>You can go all day with Sharelle</i>
<i>with this shit. Hold this shit out.</i>

29:54.125 --> 29:56.544
<i>'Cause you never gonna be fucking right.</i>

29:57.921 --> 30:00.590
<i>I do get a little frustrated,</i>
<i>but I have to remind myself,</i>

30:00.673 --> 30:03.259
<i>-"This is your business.Â Take ownership."</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

30:03.343 --> 30:04.469
<i>We need a drink.</i>

30:04.552 --> 30:05.553
<i>We do.</i>

30:06.679 --> 30:08.181
<i>I wanna share something with you,</i>

30:08.264 --> 30:12.519
<i>but I don't want you to think</i>
<i>that I purposely kept it from you.</i>

30:12.602 --> 30:16.105
<i>I didn't wanna share with you at the time</i>
<i>because I wanted to get through it.</i>

30:16.189 --> 30:19.192
<i>And I know you obviously love Bryan and I,</i>

30:19.275 --> 30:21.194
<i>I met you through Bryan,</i>

30:21.903 --> 30:24.072
<i>but Bryan and I are separated.</i>

30:24.155 --> 30:25.615
<i>Shut the fuck up.</i>

30:26.533 --> 30:28.952
<i>Yes, I still love him. He still loves me.</i>

30:29.035 --> 30:32.997
<i>It's just not working out,</i>
<i>and I feel like I gave my relationshipâ¦</i>

30:33.081 --> 30:35.583
<i>The good thing is we're not--</i>
<i>we're not vindictive.</i>

30:35.667 --> 30:37.710
<i>[voice breaking] Stop, don't cry.</i>

30:38.461 --> 30:39.963
<i>[crying] Stop, Sharelle.</i>

30:42.131 --> 30:42.966
<i>No.</i>

30:45.301 --> 30:47.887
<i>-But don't do that.</i>
<i>-[crying] No, for real?</i>

30:51.057 --> 30:52.934
<i>But we'll be fine. We'll be fine.</i>

30:53.017 --> 30:57.939
<i>We're going to still be friends.</i>
<i>I don't think we're able to work it out.</i>

30:59.524 --> 31:02.527
<i>I love him as a person in general,</i>

31:02.610 --> 31:05.655
<i>but I feel like</i>
<i>I needed more from a marriage.</i>

31:05.738 --> 31:08.157
<i>-And I don't--</i>
<i>-He has to understand that.</i>

31:09.200 --> 31:12.996
<i>I get where you're coming from.</i>
<i>I was in those same shoes, and it's hard.</i>

31:13.079 --> 31:15.498
<i>I know,</i>
<i>but it just felt like the right time.</i>

31:15.582 --> 31:18.751
<i>I didn't wanna</i>
<i>continue to keep it from you, butâ¦</i>

31:20.211 --> 31:21.588
<i>I did file for divorce.</i>

31:21.671 --> 31:23.256
<i>-It's been a couple months.</i>
<i>-Wow.</i>

31:23.339 --> 31:26.551
<i>It's been a couple months,</i>
<i>and I already moved out.</i>

31:26.634 --> 31:29.220
<i>Juawana! I was not ready for all this.</i>

31:29.304 --> 31:32.473
<i>First Rena, we going back and forth,</i>
<i>and now you telling me this.</i>

31:32.557 --> 31:33.391
<i>Yes.</i>

31:33.474 --> 31:35.226
<i>Whatever you need, I'm here for you.</i>

31:35.310 --> 31:37.896
<i>If you need a breakâ¦</i>
<i>I've been giving you a lot of tasks.</i>

31:37.979 --> 31:41.399
<i>-And you been handling it.</i>
<i>-But I feel like I have to keep busy.</i>

31:41.482 --> 31:43.776
<i>-Do any of the other ladies know?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

31:43.860 --> 31:48.406
<i>I haven't toldâ¦ The only people</i>
<i>that know is my mom, my son, you now.</i>

31:48.489 --> 31:51.242
<i>I mean, at the end of the day,</i>
<i>it's none of their business.</i>

31:51.326 --> 31:52.493
<i>I appreciate that.</i>

31:52.577 --> 31:55.705
<i>Give me a hug. Oh, Juawana.</i>

31:55.788 --> 31:57.457
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>they're doing back there?</i>

31:57.540 --> 32:00.376
<i>What could they be talking about?</i>
<i>They must be into a deep conversation.</i>

32:02.003 --> 32:04.839
<i>Ugh, I don't even</i>
<i>know what to cheers to now.</i>

32:04.923 --> 32:06.758
<i>[both] We can't cheers!</i>

32:06.841 --> 32:08.676
<i>-Let's just drink.</i>
<i>-Let's just drink.</i>

32:09.761 --> 32:13.056
<i>âª It feels like they never listen</i>
<i>When it mattersÂ âª</i>

32:13.139 --> 32:15.433
<i>âª They try to make it happy</i>
<i>Only make it sadder âª</i>

32:16.267 --> 32:17.727
<i>âª What am I to doÂ âª</i>

32:17.810 --> 32:21.189
<i>âª When my feet won't move</i>
<i>My heart says leave? âª</i>

32:21.272 --> 32:26.069
<i>âª And who am I to choose</i>
<i>Between loving you and loving me? âª</i>

32:26.152 --> 32:27.737
<i>âª What am I to doÂ âª</i>

32:27.820 --> 32:30.782
<i>âª When my feet won't move</i>
<i>My heart won't stay âª</i>

32:30.865 --> 32:35.244
<i>âª And what am I to do</i>
<i>When our love has goneÂ âª</i>

32:35.328 --> 32:38.623
<i>âª Gone awayÂ âª</i>

32:40.333 --> 32:43.628
<i>âª Gone awayÂ âª</i>
