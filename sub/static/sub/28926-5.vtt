00:23.732 --> 00:25.025
[Erica] Press the button!

00:25.108 --> 00:26.651
What do you think I'm doing?!

00:26.735 --> 00:29.029
Come on, press something!
Just press the button!

[grunts]

00:44.252 --> 00:45.211
Is everyone okay?

00:45.295 --> 00:48.089
Yeah, I'm great, now that I know that
Russians can't design elevators!

00:48.173 --> 00:50.967
I think we've clearly established
that those buttons don't work.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.552
They're buttons.
They have to do something.

00:52.635 --> 00:54.095
Yeah, if we had a keycard.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.014
-A what?
-It's an electronic lock.

00:56.097 --> 00:58.266
Same as the loading dock door.
If we don't have a keycard,

00:58.349 --> 01:00.393
-it won't operate, meaning--
-We're stuck in here.

01:00.477 --> 01:01.311
Yeah.

01:01.644 --> 01:03.897
Just so you nerds are aware,

01:03.980 --> 01:06.983
I'm supposed to be spending the night
at Tina's,

01:07.067 --> 01:09.110
and Tina always covers for me.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.280
But if I'm not home
for Uncle Jack's party tomorrow

01:12.363 --> 01:15.283
and my mom finds out
you three are responsible,

01:15.366 --> 01:19.245
she's gonna hunt you down, one by one,
and slit your throat.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.289
I don't care about Tina!

01:21.372 --> 01:23.458
Or Uncle Jack's party!

01:23.541 --> 01:28.004
Your mom's not gonna be able to find us
if we're dead in a Russian elevator!

01:29.214 --> 01:30.048
[Dustin] Hey.

01:31.382 --> 01:32.884
What if we climbed out?

05:39.172 --> 05:40.131
Drop the gun.

05:40.798 --> 05:41.716
Drop it!

05:42.884 --> 05:44.677
You understand what I'm saying, big guy?

05:44.761 --> 05:46.679
Drop the weapon.

05:46.763 --> 05:47.847
[in Russian accent] Or what?

05:49.640 --> 05:50.808
You going to shoot?

05:51.851 --> 05:52.852
Good.

06:01.944 --> 06:02.820
No.

06:03.738 --> 06:04.781
You won't do that.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.574
Why's that?

06:06.991 --> 06:08.493
Because you are policeman.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.579
Policemen have rules.

06:11.662 --> 06:12.622
Oh, yeah?

10:18.242 --> 10:19.452
Listen to me, okay?

10:19.535 --> 10:24.040
It's 6:00 a.m. and, uh, I had a late night
with Fagin and the gang, so--

10:24.123 --> 10:26.375
-I'm at the hospital with Driscoll.
-What?

10:26.459 --> 10:28.919
She's been sedated for a few hours

It's not a joke.
And, yes, I know I'm insane

Da.

11:26.310 --> 11:30.106

[Joyce] Hey.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.751

11:52.294 --> 11:54.839
What have you learned, huh?
You learned that Smirnoff over there--

11:54.922 --> 11:57.299
-[Joyce] Alexei.
-Smirnoff is Russian

11:57.383 --> 11:58.926

11:59.009 --> 12:00.219
two things we already knew.

12:00.302 --> 12:01.137
Thought we knew.

12:01.220 --> 12:04.098
But now we know-know,
because I've confirmed them.

12:04.181 --> 12:05.182
You're welcome.

12:05.266 --> 12:08.769
Yeah? Why don't you confirm
whether this baby'll start, huh?

-Yeah, duh!

lived in Illinois.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.283

Yeah, yeah, we're gonna walk to Illinois.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.133
You know, I figure we'll get there
by, like, Friday evening.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.385
I hope that works for your schedule.
Jesus Christ, Joyce.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.055
-We're not walking to Illinois, okay?
-Well, then what are we doing?

13:26.138 --> 13:27.097
I don't know, okay?

13:27.181 --> 13:29.350
I will-- I will figure something out.

13:29.433 --> 13:32.478
Isn't there someone in Indiana
who speaks Russian that--

13:32.561 --> 13:34.563
You know what? I'm all ears, Joyce.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.481
I'm all ears.

13:35.564 --> 13:36.398
I'm all ears!

13:37.149 --> 13:38.526
[Joyce] I mean, fine.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.110
Just saying.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.195
Gah!

13:41.529 --> 13:42.404
Ugh!

13:44.573 --> 13:45.407
Gah!

13:46.492 --> 13:47.660
[sighs]

13:54.124 --> 13:55.042
[Hopper] Damn it.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.003
I found him.

13:59.004 --> 13:59.964
[Max] Where is he?

14:01.382 --> 14:02.466
Woods.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.926
-[TV static hissing]
-Woods?

14:04.009 --> 14:06.011
He's with... Will's mom.

14:06.595 --> 14:07.680
My-- My mom?

14:08.389 --> 14:09.515
What are they doing?

14:09.598 --> 14:11.392
Ill... annoy.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.562
They're going to Ill-annoy.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.355
-[knocking on door]
-[Karen] Mike! Breakfast!

14:16.438 --> 14:17.731
Not now, Mom!

14:18.315 --> 14:20.442
Illinois? Illinois, like the state?

14:20.943 --> 14:22.152
The state of Illinois?

14:23.112 --> 14:24.488
[stammers] Ill-annoy.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.450
[tap stops]

14:34.623 --> 14:35.749
[Max] Does it still hurt?

14:36.917 --> 14:38.210
Only when I talk.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.921
Well, it's a good thing
you're not Mike, then.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.799
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
And you'd be in constant pain.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.301
[both chuckle]

14:46.010 --> 14:49.096
[Mike]   Something's not right.
I can't get Hopper off my back all summer,

14:49.179 --> 14:51.807
now all of a sudden,
he's hiking with Will's mom to Illinois?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.350
And Dustin's MIA, too?

14:53.434 --> 14:55.311
I mean, this can't be a coincidence.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.437
What does it matter?

14:56.520 --> 14:58.731
The bottom line is, they're not here.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.734
-It's up to us.
-Up to us to do what exactly?

15:01.817 --> 15:03.360
Find Billy and stop him.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.195
Okay, yeah,
that's a really nice sentiment,

15:05.279 --> 15:08.616
but even if El could find him again,
and that's a pretty big if, then what?

15:08.699 --> 15:11.410
We burn the shit out of him
and make sure he doesn't escape this time.

15:11.493 --> 15:13.245
-Okay, then what?
-Then we win.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.872
No, see, that's the problem.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.874
We don't. We don't win.

15:16.957 --> 15:19.627
We got the Mind Flayer out of Will before
and he just came right back.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.546
We don't just have to stop Billy,
we have to stop the Mind Flayer.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.465
-How in the hell do we do that?
-I don't know.

15:24.548 --> 15:25.674
Maybe El does.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.221
What are they still doing in there?

15:33.057 --> 15:34.016
I don't know.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.435
Girls just like hanging out in bathrooms.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.479
Why?

15:39.146 --> 15:42.024
-I mean, I don't know.
-They're conspiring against me.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.818
-That's what you're concerned about now?
-It's not my main concern.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.112
-It's just a sub-concern.
-I thought it was already over.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.365
It's not over, okay?
We're just taking a break.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.991
She said she dumped your ass.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.202
-That doesn't sound like a break.
-[Max] It wasn't!

15:53.285 --> 15:57.164
You guys do realize we can still hear
everything you're saying, right?

15:57.247 --> 15:58.624
[laughs]

15:59.124 --> 16:00.042
[whispers] Conspiring.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.002
-I told you, they're conspiring.
-[knock at door]

16:02.544 --> 16:03.712
Not now, Mom!

16:03.796 --> 16:05.464
[Nancy] Mike, open the door.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.637
[Dustin] Code red, I repeat, code red.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.013
Does anyone copy?

16:13.097 --> 16:15.683
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.

16:15.766 --> 16:19.353
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.
Does anyone copy?

16:19.436 --> 16:22.147
We are innocent children
and we are trapped under Starcourt Mall.

16:22.231 --> 16:25.234
The Red Army has infiltrated Hawkins,
and if we are found,

16:25.317 --> 16:26.902
they will torture and kill us.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.028
[Steve] Hey. [grunts]

16:28.112 --> 16:30.364
Gotta take it easy on that thing.
Gonna drain the battery.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.032
-The mall just opened.
-So?

16:32.116 --> 16:33.575
So someone could be in range.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.412
What do you think, Petey the Mall Cop
is gonna rappel down here

16:36.495 --> 16:37.496
and save the day?

16:37.579 --> 16:39.206
All right, why are you such a cranky pants

16:39.289 --> 16:41.166
after getting to spend the night
with Robin?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.002
Shh! Jesus Christ.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.337
Will you just give up
on your creepy dream already?

16:45.421 --> 16:46.880
I heard you guys talking all night.

16:46.964 --> 16:49.049
We were trying to figure out a way
to open up the door

16:49.133 --> 16:50.759
while you children were sleeping.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.177
After eight hours,

16:52.594 --> 16:54.555
we're still exactly nowhere, which is,

16:54.638 --> 16:57.474
you know, probably just a little bit
of the reason why I'm feeling just...

16:57.725 --> 16:59.393
-a tad cranky.
-[unzipping sound]

16:59.476 --> 17:00.436
What are you doing?

17:02.146 --> 17:04.565
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm taking a leak. Look away.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.649
Look away!

17:05.733 --> 17:06.608
[Steve's voice echoes]

17:06.692 --> 17:07.776
[scoffs]

17:13.574 --> 17:16.160
Can you redirect your stream, please?

17:16.243 --> 17:17.619
[Robin's voice echoes]

17:19.788 --> 17:20.664
Ugh.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.419
Hey, hey! Be careful, careful, careful!

17:25.502 --> 17:26.754
We don't even know what that is.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.380
Exactly. It could be useful.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.840
Useful how?

17:29.923 --> 17:32.176
We can survive down here a long time
without food,

17:32.259 --> 17:35.387
but if the human body doesn't get water,
it will die.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.764
I hate to break it to you,

17:36.847 --> 17:39.600
but  this  is not water.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.101
No, but it's a liquid,

17:41.185 --> 17:42.978
and if it comes down to me
drinking that shit

17:43.062 --> 17:44.396
or dying of thirst,

17:44.480 --> 17:45.522
I drink.

17:45.606 --> 17:46.440
[scoffs].

17:46.523 --> 17:49.109
[distant electronic whirring]

17:54.615 --> 17:55.491
We've got company.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.079
[suspenseful synth music playing]

18:09.171 --> 18:10.297

[indistinct female voice on PA]

18:18.847 --> 18:20.349
[sniffing]

18:21.183 --> 18:22.267
[in Russian] You smell that?

18:22.810 --> 18:23.811
[in Russian] What?

18:25.062 --> 18:26.063
Piss.

18:27.022 --> 18:28.148
[sniffing]

18:51.755 --> 18:53.590
[elevator door whirring]

18:57.511 --> 18:59.138
[Steve grunts]

19:00.389 --> 19:01.390
Let's go.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.269
-Go. Go, go, go, go, go.
-[Erica] I'm going!

19:06.353 --> 19:08.105
-Henderson. Go, go.
-[vial buckles]

19:12.025 --> 19:13.318
[Robin] Come on, Steve, let's go!

19:16.446 --> 19:17.865
[sizzling]

19:19.324 --> 19:20.993
-Jesus Christ.
-[Erica] Ooh!

19:24.079 --> 19:25.539
You still wanna drink that?

19:27.666 --> 19:29.751
Holy mother of God.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.338
Well...

19:33.797 --> 19:35.465
hope you guys are in good shape.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.385
Looking at you, roast beef.

19:41.346 --> 19:42.347
Let's go, come on.

19:43.765 --> 19:44.725
Why me?

19:49.730 --> 19:51.190
It was the same thing,

19:51.273 --> 19:53.233
the exact same thing
that happened to Will last year.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.861
And look at this.
Look at the body temperatures.

19:57.613 --> 19:58.822
He likes it cold.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.825
Okay, so this crazy old woman
who was eating fertilizer--

20:01.909 --> 20:03.702
-Mrs. Driscoll.
-Right, yeah, Mrs. Driscoll.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.412
-What time was this attack?
-Last night.

20:05.495 --> 20:06.872
Right, but what time last night?

20:06.955 --> 20:08.957
-Around 9:00.
-You waited all night to call?

20:09.541 --> 20:11.084
I was waiting for the doctors
to run some tests.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.252
You weren't there?

20:12.336 --> 20:13.629
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

20:13.712 --> 20:14.588
Hallelujah!

20:14.671 --> 20:15.505
Ooh.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.926
Um, so, wha-- what time was your...
sauna test?

20:19.009 --> 20:20.052
[in unison] Around 9:00.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.222
Well, that proves it.
That proves my theory.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.681
She's flayed, just like Billy.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.100
-Flayed?
-The Mind Flayer. He flays people.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.185
Takes over their mind.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.479
Once they do that,
they basically become him.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.148
-If there are two flayed--
-We have to assume there are more.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.316
Heather.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.694
Billy was doing something to her.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.279
[Heather whimpers echo]

20:39.363 --> 20:40.822
She was scared.

20:41.698 --> 20:42.783
She was screaming.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.452
-[screams]
-Bad screams.

20:45.535 --> 20:46.954
-What's a good scream?
-Max said--

20:47.037 --> 20:49.957
-Doesn't matter.
-I'm sorry, I'm lost. Who is Heather?

20:50.040 --> 20:52.542
-She's a lifeguard at the pool.
-Heather Holloway?

20:53.835 --> 20:54.670
[both] Tom.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.177
[car doors shut]

21:03.053 --> 21:04.054
Seriously?

21:04.429 --> 21:05.722
Welcome to my world.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.033
-Oh, my God. Can you not walk so close?
-What?

22:06.116 --> 22:08.452
Can you not walk so close to me?
You stink.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.828
[Hopper laughs]

22:09.911 --> 22:12.122
I get it, I get it. You're upset, right?

22:12.205 --> 22:13.915
'Cause I, uh... I blew up the car?

22:13.999 --> 22:15.250
Yeah, with me in it.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.711
Well, I just want to remind you
of something, Joyce.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.130
-I am not a mechanic.
-Yeah, clearly.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.882
That's why you should've listened
to Alexei.

22:21.965 --> 22:24.343
Oh, right, yeah.
Your new boyfriend, right?

22:24.426 --> 22:27.763
Yes. Every man I talk to from now on
has to be my boyfriend.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.057
Yeah, he reminds me a bit
of a Russian Scott Clarke.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.183
Oh, here we go.

22:31.266 --> 22:34.478
Maybe you should go on a date.
I don't know, I'm thinking, like, Enzo's?

22:35.228 --> 22:36.271
-Whoa.
-What?

22:36.355 --> 22:37.314
He's running.

[Alexei whimpers, grunts]

You son of a bitch!

-[Alexei mutters in Russian]
-[Hopper] Hey! Smirnoff!

22:45.864 --> 22:47.199
Get back here!

[register beeping]

23:33.662 --> 23:36.039
So, what are you,
some kinda bounty hunter?

23:36.123 --> 23:37.207
I'm a cop.

23:38.458 --> 23:39.793
I'm undercover.

Oh, hey, Karen, it's Joyce.

23:51.054 --> 23:52.889
Yeah, I-- I'm just checking on Will.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.350
At the movies?

Just keep your mouth shut, all right?

23:59.104 --> 24:00.147
[slurping loudly]

24:03.066 --> 24:05.777
All right, all right, hop in.
Come on, get in.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.028
-Hey!
-Hey!

24:07.112 --> 24:08.822
You "hey!" You "hey!"

24:08.905 --> 24:11.199
This is a police emergency, all right?

24:12.868 --> 24:14.369
I need to commandeer your vehicle.

24:14.911 --> 24:15.829
What?

24:15.912 --> 24:18.123
As long as there's a... a...

24:18.206 --> 24:19.458
[Hopper] What is your name, sir?

24:19.541 --> 24:21.001
-Todd.
-Todd?

24:21.084 --> 24:22.252
-Yeah.
-Todd.

24:22.335 --> 24:23.920
-Todd.
-Todd...

24:24.921 --> 24:25.797
listen to me.

That man in there,

24:27.591 --> 24:29.134
I know he doesn't look it,

24:29.217 --> 24:33.096
but he is one of the most dangerous men
in the world.

24:34.598 --> 24:35.807
He's, uh...

24:37.267 --> 24:39.311
-murdered many children.
-What?

24:39.394 --> 24:42.063
Yeah, he's a true psychopath.
I tracked him over two state lines.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.273
[Joyce] Hey, what's going on?

24:43.356 --> 24:44.900
Ah, Detective Byers.

24:44.983 --> 24:45.859
Uh...

24:45.942 --> 24:47.194
this is Todd.

24:47.944 --> 24:52.157
He's agreed to... lend us his vehicle
to transport our dangerous criminal.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.826
Oh, yes, he-- very dangerous, uh,

24:54.910 --> 24:55.785
forger... er.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.704
Yeah. Uh, child murderer.

24:57.787 --> 24:59.706
-Child murderer?
-We should really get going.

24:59.789 --> 25:00.957
Hey, how do I get my car back?

25:01.041 --> 25:02.792
-You just call the station.
-What station?

25:02.876 --> 25:05.420
-[heavy metal resumes]
-Ooh, I like the sound of that, Todd!

25:05.504 --> 25:06.505
Hey, what station?

25:06.588 --> 25:08.256
You're doing the right thing!

25:08.340 --> 25:10.342
[tires squealing]

25:10.425 --> 25:12.302
Hey, what the... Hey!

25:14.137 --> 25:15.138
Dude!

25:19.351 --> 25:21.937
[Dustin] I mean, you have to admit,
as a feat of engineering alone,

25:22.020 --> 25:23.355
this is impressive.

25:23.438 --> 25:25.482
What are you talking about?
It's a total fire hazard.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.025
There's no stairs, there's no exit,

25:27.108 --> 25:29.236
there's just an elevator
that drops you halfway to hell.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.153
They're Commies.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.614
You don't pay people, they cut corners.

25:32.697 --> 25:33.990
To be fair to our Russian comrades,

25:34.074 --> 25:36.409
I don't think this tunnel was designed
for walking.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.495
Think about it,
they developed the perfect system

25:38.578 --> 25:39.663
for transporting that cargo.

25:39.746 --> 25:41.748
It all comes into the mall
like any old delivery.

25:41.831 --> 25:44.376
And then they load it up onto those trucks
and nobody's the wiser.

25:44.459 --> 25:45.877
[Steve] You think
they built this whole mall

25:45.961 --> 25:48.171
so they could transport
that green poison?

25:48.255 --> 25:50.715
I very seriously doubt
it's something as boring as poison.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.968
It's gotta be much more valuable,
like promethium or something.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.344
What the hell is promethium?

25:54.427 --> 25:57.889
It's what Victor Stone's dad used to make
Cyborg's bionic and cybernetic components.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.850
You're all so nerdy,
it makes me physically ill.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.561
No, no, no.
No, don't lump me in with them.

26:02.644 --> 26:03.687
I'm not a nerd, all right?

26:03.770 --> 26:05.438
[Robin] Why so sensitive, Harrington?

26:05.522 --> 26:07.524
Afraid of losing cool points
to a ten-year-old child?

26:07.607 --> 26:10.235
No, I'm just saying I don't know jack shit
about Prometheus.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.152
[Dustin] Promethium.

26:11.236 --> 26:14.739
Prometheus is a Greek mythological figure,
but whatever. All I'm saying is,

26:14.823 --> 26:16.825
it's probably being used
to make something.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.159
Or power something.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.120
-Like a nuclear weapon?
-Totally.

26:20.203 --> 26:22.289
Walking towards a nuclear weapon.
That's great.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.708
-That'd be great.
-But if they're building something,

26:24.791 --> 26:25.834
why here?

26:25.917 --> 26:29.296
I mean, Hawkins. Seriously. Of all places.

26:29.379 --> 26:32.632
At the very best, we're a toilet stop
on your way to Disneyland,

26:32.716 --> 26:34.926
but maybe that's it.
Maybe it's our very...

26:35.010 --> 26:36.469
-You think the Russians know?
-About--

26:36.553 --> 26:38.847
-They could.
-So it's connected?

26:38.930 --> 26:40.056
-Maybe.
-How?

26:40.348 --> 26:41.558
I don't know, but it's...

26:42.100 --> 26:43.018
[both] Possible.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.895
I'm sorry, is there something you'd
like to share with the class?

-Wherever that broadcast is coming from--
-It's close.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.629
And if there's one thing we know
about that signal...

27:10.712 --> 27:12.297
It can reach the surface.

27:13.840 --> 27:14.674
Let's go.

Jesus, it's freezing.

[sniffs] Do you guys smell that?

28:04.182 --> 28:06.059
[all sniffing]

28:06.768 --> 28:07.602
Oh.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.354
Oh, God.

28:10.355 --> 28:11.439
More chemicals.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.071
You think they're guzzling this shit?

28:18.154 --> 28:20.657
Yeah, either that or they just went on
a hell of a cleaning spree.

28:20.740 --> 28:23.827
But last year, Will didn't eat chemicals.

28:23.910 --> 28:25.161
-Did you?
-No.

28:25.245 --> 28:26.913
This is something new.

28:27.455 --> 28:29.165
Mr. Clarke, fifth grade. Posit.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.042
What happens
when you mix chemicals together?

28:31.126 --> 28:32.794

You create a new substance.

What if the flaying,

30:10.475 --> 30:12.435
it's taking place somewhere else?

30:12.519 --> 30:14.687
There must be a place
where all this started, right?

30:14.771 --> 30:15.647
A source.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.607
Somewhere he didn't want me to see.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.359
[faint shrieking noise]

30:19.442 --> 30:22.237
If we can find the source,
then maybe we can stop him.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.239
Or at least stop it from spreading

30:24.322 --> 30:26.032
or doing whatever the hell he's doing
with those chemicals.

30:26.115 --> 30:27.450
How do we find it?

30:27.700 --> 30:29.035
Mrs. Driscoll.

30:30.370 --> 30:33.039

why don't we let her?

-What else did he say?

31:03.361 --> 31:04.237
This psycho?

31:04.320 --> 31:06.322
No offense, but I already
went over all this with the cops.

-Positive. The door was open for a second,

35:19.867 --> 35:22.537
and I saw a bunch of lights
and machines and shit in there.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.330

36:23.848 --> 36:26.684

37:04.472 --> 37:06.182
You want to walk all the way back?

37:06.265 --> 37:08.809
Well, we can hang out for a little bit,
relax, have a picnic maybe.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.312
Have a picnic?
We came here for the radio.

37:11.395 --> 37:13.940
[Dustin] This plan is way better.
If I knew Steve could knock out a Russian,

37:14.023 --> 37:15.608

See, you're the only one who gon' tell--
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Excuse me!

38:37.940 --> 38:38.941
Oh, um...

38:39.525 --> 38:42.028
I was just going to visit
my grandma again.

39:30.993 --> 39:32.745
mortifyingly...

39:34.205 --> 39:35.039

39:37.208 --> 39:38.834
Don't let that go to your head.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.002
I won't.
