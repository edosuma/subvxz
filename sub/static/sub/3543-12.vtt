WEBVTT

00:00.721 --> 00:02.255
My name is Elena Gilbert.

00:02.490 --> 00:05.571
I'm a new vampire, and there
have been complications.

00:05.671 --> 00:07.337
I know that I'm sired
to you, Damon.

00:07.339 --> 00:08.839
You know what would
make me happy?

00:08.841 --> 00:11.558
That what you actually felt for me
was real.

00:11.560 --> 00:13.360
But there's hope
now there's a cure.

00:13.362 --> 00:15.979
This cure has ruined us, and it
hasn't even been found yet.

00:15.981 --> 00:17.481
What do you know
about Silas?

00:17.483 --> 00:19.349
He's the world's first
immortal being,

00:19.351 --> 00:21.318
who just happens
to be the person with the cure.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.237
Unlikely alliances
have formed.

00:23.239 --> 00:24.321
What the hell
are you doing here?

00:24.323 --> 00:25.289
How can I help?

00:25.291 --> 00:28.525
No feelings.
No attachment.

00:31.329 --> 00:32.713
To make sure we
never find the cure.

00:32.715 --> 00:34.331
You're going to find
Jeremy Gilbert,

00:34.333 --> 00:35.999
and you're going to
kill him.

00:36.001 --> 00:37.835
Our only
chance is to risk everything.

00:37.837 --> 00:39.219
Kol compelled Damon
to kill you.

00:39.221 --> 00:41.505
You're gonna kill
Kol instead.

01:39.531 --> 01:41.398
I don't appreciate you
invading my privacy

01:41.400 --> 01:43.367
like some kind of
creeping Tom.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.101
Well, I apologize
for breaking up

01:45.103 --> 01:47.237
this sordid little tryst,

01:47.239 --> 01:49.239
but I do have some
urgent business.

01:49.241 --> 01:51.375
Or have you forgotten
that our paranoid brother Kol

01:51.377 --> 01:52.776
is running around
with a white oak stake

01:52.778 --> 01:54.411
and homicide on
the brain?

01:54.413 --> 01:56.296
He tried to kill me last night.
I didn't forget.

01:56.298 --> 01:58.165
Yes. Well,
unfortunately,

01:58.167 --> 02:00.884
he seems to have absconded with my
set of daggers.

02:00.886 --> 02:03.887
Oh, poor Nik. However will you
get your way

02:03.889 --> 02:05.589
without your
precious daggers?

02:05.591 --> 02:07.841
They were so handy when you
wanted to end a conversation

02:07.843 --> 02:09.258
with one of us.

02:09.261 --> 02:11.261
Kol's irrational
fear of Silas

02:11.263 --> 02:13.080
has pushed him
off the edge.

02:13.082 --> 02:15.149
We need to put him down before
he does any more damage.

02:15.151 --> 02:16.733
Now, I know you have
the last dagger,

02:16.735 --> 02:19.486
and I know you have
some white ash, so hand it over.

02:19.488 --> 02:23.073
Hmm. And leave myself
unprotected?

02:23.075 --> 02:26.610
You can file that request
under "no chance in hell."

02:26.612 --> 02:27.744
Be gone by the time
I've showered.

02:27.746 --> 02:30.164
Lurkers aren't
welcome here.

02:34.936 --> 02:36.936
I need that dagger, Stefan.

02:37.822 --> 02:41.091
Talk some sense
into her.

02:41.093 --> 02:43.159
Why don't you
talk some sense into her?

02:43.161 --> 02:45.879
I'm headed home to play
prison guard to Damon.

02:45.881 --> 02:47.831
He's on lockdown
ever since Kol compelled him

02:47.833 --> 02:49.099
to kill Jeremy
last night.

02:49.101 --> 02:52.186
You see? That's
my point exactly.

02:52.188 --> 02:54.671
If you let Kol
run free,

02:54.673 --> 02:57.057
then Jeremy won't live to see
his junior prom,

02:57.059 --> 03:00.343
and we can kiss
our map to the cure good-bye.

03:00.345 --> 03:03.864
But if you help me
dagger Kol,

03:03.866 --> 03:06.116
Damon will be
uncompelled,

03:06.118 --> 03:08.318
Jeremy will live, and we'll all be
on our merry way

03:08.320 --> 03:10.821
to a human Elena.

03:14.025 --> 03:15.325
Where are you?

03:15.327 --> 03:16.994
I told Caroline
I'd take her place

03:16.996 --> 03:19.997
at decade dance prep,
but none of the rest of you showed.

03:19.999 --> 03:22.165
I know. I'm sorry.
I had to, though.

03:22.167 --> 03:23.550
I've got Jeremy
under house arrest

03:23.552 --> 03:25.969
because Kol wants
to kill him.

03:25.971 --> 03:27.370
And Klaus
wants to take him

03:27.372 --> 03:30.474
on some vampire-slaying
road trip.

03:30.476 --> 03:33.209
And since neither
of them were invited in,

03:33.211 --> 03:35.646
it's the only place
that I can keep him safe.

03:35.648 --> 03:38.065
Why does it sound like
you're under fire?

03:38.067 --> 03:40.851
Apparently I'm living
in a fraternity house now.

03:40.853 --> 03:42.069
I'm training.

03:42.071 --> 03:43.219
Me, too.

03:43.221 --> 03:45.055
Train yourself to
do some dishes.

03:45.057 --> 03:46.356
And put these
weapons away

03:46.358 --> 03:50.527
before someone tries to
use one on me.

03:50.529 --> 03:52.579
Well, it's hard for me to
look forward to this dance

03:52.581 --> 03:55.231
while you're trapped
in your house.

03:55.233 --> 03:57.918
Listen, I have a plan
to put an end to all of this.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.871
I want Jeremy
to kill Kol.

04:00.873 --> 04:03.073
You want him to kill
an original?

04:03.075 --> 04:04.625
Think about it.

04:04.627 --> 04:07.711
Kol's sire line must
stretch to the moon by now.

04:07.713 --> 04:11.348
If Jeremy kills Kol, every vampire
that he's ever turned,

04:11.350 --> 04:15.302
not to mention everyone that
they've turned, will die,

04:15.304 --> 04:17.771
which means the Hunter's mark
will be complete,

04:17.773 --> 04:20.724
and we'll have our key
to finding the cure.

04:20.726 --> 04:24.761
I'm on my way.
We'll figure it out.

04:24.763 --> 04:26.446
Do you think Caroline
will notice

04:26.448 --> 04:29.399
if there's only 89
red balloons?

04:29.401 --> 04:32.402
Actually, probably yes.

04:32.404 --> 04:34.788
Aah!

04:40.828 --> 04:41.995
What happened?

04:41.997 --> 04:44.298
I don't know.

04:44.300 --> 04:47.067
There's something
in the water.

04:47.069 --> 04:48.318
Are you serious?

04:48.320 --> 04:51.054
You dumped vervain
into the water supply?

04:51.056 --> 04:52.089
Where did you even
get it?

04:52.091 --> 04:53.724
I have my sources.

04:53.726 --> 04:55.258
I'm also reinstating
the curfew

04:55.260 --> 04:56.977
and canceling
all town events.

04:56.979 --> 04:58.478
Dad, there's
the dance tonight.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.846
Not anymore.

04:59.848 --> 05:01.431
Are you serious?

05:01.433 --> 05:03.900
Honey, I'm trying
to protect you, not punish you.

05:03.902 --> 05:05.969
The well-being
of this town is my job now.

05:05.971 --> 05:08.105
No. Dad, it's mine,
and I've been doing fine

05:08.107 --> 05:09.356
without you getting
involved.

05:09.358 --> 05:10.741
You've been doing fine?

05:10.743 --> 05:11.975
Would you like me
to read you all the names

05:11.977 --> 05:13.744
of the people that have
gone missing

05:13.746 --> 05:17.147
or died in tragic accidents
in your senior year alone?

05:17.149 --> 05:18.332
Head straight home,
please.

05:18.334 --> 05:21.151
We're having
a family meeting.

05:24.756 --> 05:25.922
No one can get
to the cure

05:25.924 --> 05:28.175
if you're too dead
to find it.

05:32.847 --> 05:36.516
Aah! Aah! Aah!

05:36.518 --> 05:40.136
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

06:05.447 --> 06:07.373
Gonna snap my neck again?

06:08.866 --> 06:11.918
Because I woke up
feeling completely unmurderous,

06:11.920 --> 06:15.555
and I'm pretty sure
that it's safe to set me free.

06:22.063 --> 06:25.649
You practically
bled me dry.

06:25.651 --> 06:28.351
At least spring for
a bag or something.

06:28.353 --> 06:30.570
I'm thirsty.

06:34.368 --> 06:36.763
Not exactly what I had in mind.

06:37.445 --> 06:40.197
Uh. Uh.

06:47.671 --> 06:49.295
Hello mate.

06:49.674 --> 06:51.208
What the hell
are you doing here?

06:51.210 --> 06:53.210
Babysitting.

06:53.212 --> 06:55.378
Oh.

06:55.380 --> 06:58.248
Give him a vial of blood
every couple of hours

06:58.250 --> 07:00.383
so he doesn't desiccate.

07:00.385 --> 07:02.352
If he gets too much
strength back

07:02.354 --> 07:04.971
or if he just
annoys you,

07:04.973 --> 07:07.107
bleed him out again.

07:10.812 --> 07:13.613
Is that your best shot?

07:13.615 --> 07:16.366
He's still pissed at me
for sleeping with Elena.

07:16.368 --> 07:17.951
Are you sure
about that?

07:17.953 --> 07:19.453
Because I caught him
trying to sneak out

07:19.455 --> 07:21.437
of Rebekah's bed
this morning,

07:21.439 --> 07:25.542
which would suggest
to me that he's moved on.

07:25.544 --> 07:28.545
Well, well. Looks
like my brother

07:28.547 --> 07:32.615
ripped out a page
of my revenge sex handbook.

07:32.617 --> 07:35.085
Well, why don't you two
enjoy your little, uh,

07:35.087 --> 07:37.420
villain bonding time?

07:37.422 --> 07:40.674
I'll let you know when I get
the dagger from Rebekah.

07:56.032 --> 07:57.355
Damon's fine.

07:57.808 --> 07:59.776
With all the creature
comforts he deserves.

07:59.778 --> 08:01.578
That's not
why I called.

08:01.580 --> 08:04.698
Kol just tried
to kill Bonnie.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.750
What? Is she ok?

08:06.752 --> 08:08.585
Yeah, just
shaken up.

08:08.587 --> 08:09.652
She managed to
hold him off,

08:09.654 --> 08:11.254
but Kol seems
pretty intent

08:11.256 --> 08:13.290
on murdering anyone who's looking
for that cure.

08:13.292 --> 08:15.208
Yeah. Klaus has me
trying to convince Rebekah

08:15.210 --> 08:17.794
to give up her dagger
so we can take care of Kol.

08:17.796 --> 08:20.330
I don't want to
just dagger Kol.

08:20.332 --> 08:22.516
I want Jeremy
to kill him.

08:28.672 --> 08:30.273
What did you
just say?

08:30.275 --> 08:32.642
Bonnie says she's got
all this crazy new power.

08:32.644 --> 08:33.943
She thinks she can
hold him long enough

08:33.946 --> 08:35.345
for Jeremy to get
a clean shot.

08:35.347 --> 08:36.846
And then what, huh?

08:36.847 --> 08:37.981
Klaus and Rebekah
will kill every single one of us

08:37.982 --> 08:39.399
out of spite.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.902
They may be
dysfunctional, bickering lunatics,

08:41.904 --> 08:43.370
but they stick
together no matter what.

08:43.371 --> 08:44.905
That's why you need
to find the dagger

08:44.907 --> 08:47.357
and use it on Rebekah.

08:47.359 --> 08:48.858
She can't come looking
for revenge

08:48.860 --> 08:51.411
if she's lying in a box.

08:54.365 --> 08:56.082
I know you can't because
vampires can't use the dagger,

08:56.084 --> 08:57.884
but Matt can.

08:57.886 --> 09:02.205
It's not like she
doesn't deserve it.

09:02.207 --> 09:04.841
And Bonnie thinks that she can
get Klaus out of the picture, too,

09:04.843 --> 09:06.542
at least temporarily.

09:06.544 --> 09:09.212
Once we get this cure,
none of this will matter

09:09.214 --> 09:11.431
because we can use it
against them.

09:11.433 --> 09:16.236
All right, fine,
but how do you plan to lure Kol in?

09:21.193 --> 09:23.577
Jeremy Gilbert.

09:23.579 --> 09:26.196
Nice to see I'm still
on your speed dial, mate.

09:26.198 --> 09:29.416
Hey, you want to meet up
at the batting cages in Denver?

09:29.418 --> 09:32.452
Actually,
it's Elena Gilbert.

09:32.454 --> 09:34.004
What a treat.

09:34.006 --> 09:35.905
Yeah, I was just
thinking of all the clever ways

09:35.907 --> 09:37.757
I could have
your brother killed,

09:37.759 --> 09:40.210
but I'd settle
for ripping off

09:40.212 --> 09:41.411
his illustrated arm
instead.

09:41.413 --> 09:45.348
I need to talk
to you--in person.

09:45.350 --> 09:49.219
I want to call
a truce in the name of Silas.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.724
I'll meet you
wherever you want.

09:54.726 --> 09:56.226
I'll come to you.

09:56.228 --> 09:58.028
I'll tell you what.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.646
How about
I come to you?

10:06.770 --> 10:09.105
Open the door
and invite me in.

10:15.428 --> 10:16.862
I'm waiting.

10:16.864 --> 10:19.748
Let me in, and let's
talk truce.

10:22.301 --> 10:23.614
Hello?

10:23.620 --> 10:25.237
Wouldn't it be kind of
stupid to invite you in?

10:25.239 --> 10:26.822
On the contrary.

10:26.824 --> 10:28.407
I can't kill your brother with
my own two hands,

10:28.409 --> 10:30.108
or I'll suffer
the hunter's curse

10:30.110 --> 10:32.611
and spend the next
20 years trying to off myself

10:32.613 --> 10:34.330
in gruesome ways.

10:36.395 --> 10:38.116
And I've heard that vervain's
back in town,

10:38.117 --> 10:41.086
so I can't compel you
to kill him either.

10:42.365 --> 10:43.589
So I think it's fair to say

10:43.590 --> 10:46.926
you're semi-safe,
for now.

10:48.637 --> 10:49.895
He's the only one who can
invite him inside.

10:49.896 --> 10:53.966
He's right,
obviously.

11:00.807 --> 11:02.441
You'd think being
alive for over 1,000 years

11:02.443 --> 11:04.276
would teach me
some manners,

11:04.278 --> 11:07.012
but I couldn't
resist stopping by.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.164
If I let you in,
my brother goes.

11:09.166 --> 11:12.001
You're not
getting near him.

11:12.003 --> 11:13.619
Fair enough.

11:16.898 --> 11:18.549
You can come in.

11:21.719 --> 11:23.719
No gold medal for bravery,
I see.

11:24.431 --> 11:27.099
Another thing I love
about the modern age

11:27.101 --> 11:30.853
is music anytime
you like.

11:34.166 --> 11:35.873
So, is the part

11:35.874 --> 11:36.800
where you offer
me a drink

11:36.801 --> 11:38.350
so we can have
a proper chat.

11:50.380 --> 11:51.831
The colors, the fabric,

11:51.832 --> 11:53.315
the eighties
were just tragic.

11:53.317 --> 11:55.084
You know, I think
shoulder pads

11:55.086 --> 11:58.788
rival 17th-century Puritan
smocks for crimes against fashion.

11:58.790 --> 12:00.423
Looking for something
to wear to the dance?

12:00.425 --> 12:03.626
Aye. Are you
asking me to a date?

12:03.628 --> 12:06.995
Actually,
it was canceled.

12:12.950 --> 12:14.136
So why are you here?

12:14.137 --> 12:16.355
Back for more
dagger talk?

12:16.357 --> 12:17.640
Somebody has
some trust issues.

12:17.642 --> 12:21.277
It's called
a healthy skepticism.

12:21.279 --> 12:23.562
I know you were trying
to sneak out this morning.

12:23.564 --> 12:24.747
I'm not stupid.

12:24.749 --> 12:26.582
Sorry.

12:26.584 --> 12:29.618
I'm still trying
to get used to this.

12:29.620 --> 12:30.619
Do you regret it?

12:30.621 --> 12:31.720
No.

12:31.722 --> 12:34.140
Do you want it
to happen again?

12:36.011 --> 12:37.161
Maybe.

12:37.224 --> 12:40.910
Even if I don't
give you the dagger?

12:40.912 --> 12:42.612
You think that
I would sleep with you

12:42.614 --> 12:43.963
just to get
the dagger?

12:43.965 --> 12:47.083
Don't give me
that innocent look.

12:47.085 --> 12:48.284
You've done
plenty to me

12:48.286 --> 12:49.736
in the name of
getting what you want.

12:49.738 --> 12:52.722
Well, I guess I should pack up
these racks.

12:52.724 --> 12:54.257
Just another
failed attempt

12:54.259 --> 12:55.959
at getting to
a high-school dance.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.728
Why do you care so much
about a high school dance?

12:59.730 --> 13:01.815
I don't.
I was just bored.

13:01.817 --> 13:03.433
Right.

13:05.706 --> 13:08.075
Well, we can still go.
If you want?

13:09.156 --> 13:11.574
Not if it's
canceled, we can't.

13:11.576 --> 13:13.660
Since when do you
care about the rules?

13:17.482 --> 13:19.148
You know, none of this
would be an issue

13:19.150 --> 13:22.085
if you'd have just
done your job properly.

13:22.087 --> 13:25.004
I was perfectly
willing to let you train Jeremy.

13:25.006 --> 13:27.156
No, you weren't.
Are you kidding?

13:27.158 --> 13:29.175
You got there
on day two.

13:29.177 --> 13:30.660
Do you know how
hard it is to get

13:30.662 --> 13:32.662
these X-Box brains
to focus?

13:32.664 --> 13:35.298
And then when I turned
a room full of barflies

13:35.300 --> 13:37.016
into vampires
for him to slaughter,

13:37.018 --> 13:38.968
you let Kol kill them.

13:38.970 --> 13:41.354
Your brother problem,
not mine, buddy.

13:41.356 --> 13:42.672
And whose bright idea
was it

13:42.674 --> 13:45.275
to saddle Jeremy
with a conscience, hmm?

13:45.277 --> 13:47.277
Well, we couldn't
have him trying to stake Elena

13:47.279 --> 13:48.862
in her sleep,
now, could we?

13:48.864 --> 13:51.898
Ah, yes, for
the love of Elena.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.683
How is it that she manages
to overlook

13:53.685 --> 13:55.285
every horrific thing
you've ever done?

13:55.287 --> 13:57.120
Is it willful
ignorance

13:57.122 --> 13:58.821
or perhaps something
more pathological?

13:58.823 --> 14:00.657
Some people
are just more capable

14:00.659 --> 14:02.292
of forgiveness than others.

14:02.294 --> 14:05.828
Bet you score about a negative 500
in that realm.

14:05.830 --> 14:08.998
Come on. There
must be a secret.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.334
It can't just be the sire bond.
What is it?

14:11.336 --> 14:12.835
Compulsion?

14:12.837 --> 14:14.870
Manipulation?

14:19.746 --> 14:21.058
What is it you say to her?

14:30.475 --> 14:32.397
I think this has
something to do

14:32.489 --> 14:35.491
with a certain
blond vampire.

14:35.493 --> 14:36.626
I think you murdered
Carol Lockwood,

14:36.628 --> 14:38.127
and I think
you're worried

14:38.129 --> 14:40.997
that Caroline's never
going to forgive you.

14:40.999 --> 14:42.465
You've done worse.

14:42.467 --> 14:47.303
Debatable. See,
I don't mind being the bad guy,

14:47.305 --> 14:49.472
because somebody has to fill
that role and get things done.

14:49.474 --> 14:52.642
You do bad things
for no reason.

14:52.644 --> 14:54.477
You do them
to be a dick.

14:54.479 --> 14:57.013
Debatable.

14:57.015 --> 14:59.682
If you're gonna be bad,
be bad with purpose.

14:59.684 --> 15:02.569
Otherwise you're just
not worth forgiving.

15:15.271 --> 15:17.816
Sorry, I have to take up
the old people alcohol.

15:20.137 --> 15:22.839
Yeah, that's the problem
with people today.

15:22.841 --> 15:24.507
They have no
drinking imagination.

15:24.509 --> 15:26.643
Turn-of-the-century
New Orleans--

15:26.645 --> 15:28.061
now, they knew
how to make a drink.

15:28.063 --> 15:29.712
You lived
in New Orleans?

15:29.714 --> 15:31.397
We all did,

15:31.399 --> 15:34.216
till Niklaus shoved
a dagger in my heart.

15:34.218 --> 15:36.552
Why? What did you do?

15:36.554 --> 15:38.688
What makes you think
I did anything?

15:38.690 --> 15:40.056
Has your alliance
with my brother

15:40.058 --> 15:42.692
softened you
to his horrors?

15:42.694 --> 15:45.695
I don't have
an alliance with Klaus.

15:45.697 --> 15:47.730
We had a mutual interest
in finding the cure.

15:47.732 --> 15:49.082
That's all.

15:49.084 --> 15:50.083
Had?

15:50.085 --> 15:51.901
Yes.

15:51.903 --> 15:53.536
And I'm willing to
give up looking for it

15:53.538 --> 15:56.623
if you promise to
leave my brother alone.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.953
Now can you teach me
how to make this?

16:05.282 --> 16:07.282
I'll get some ice.

16:27.999 --> 16:29.272
Bonnie where are you,

16:29.273 --> 16:31.741
I've called, like,
17 times.

16:31.743 --> 16:35.545
Kol is in our house.
We need you.

16:35.547 --> 16:37.747
Ok, I'm headed
to your house now.

16:40.751 --> 16:43.285
Would you like one?

16:43.287 --> 16:45.305
Sure. Why not?

16:49.280 --> 16:51.280
You're really good at that game.

16:51.741 --> 16:54.827
Especially considering
you've been locked up in a coffin

16:54.829 --> 16:56.078
for a hundred years.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.997
I'm a quick learner.

16:57.999 --> 16:59.630
Speedy reflexes.

16:59.631 --> 17:01.551
It's not much like the
real thing, though, is it?

17:02.521 --> 17:03.761
You have killed, haven't you?

17:04.830 --> 17:08.111
Or are you one of those
Mary Sue vampires?

17:10.691 --> 17:12.891
I killed...once.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.800
I'm guessing your number is
a lot higher than mine.

17:17.741 --> 17:19.070
You lose track over the years.

17:20.661 --> 17:22.191
So are we going
to talk about Silas

17:22.192 --> 17:23.991
or just jibber jabber?

17:47.201 --> 17:49.991
No one else seems
to think Silas exists.

17:50.341 --> 17:51.470
So why do you?

17:51.471 --> 17:52.941
I used to run with some witches

17:53.181 --> 17:55.101
in Africa in the 14th century,

17:55.691 --> 17:57.441
Haiti in the 17th century,

17:57.591 --> 17:59.331
New Orleans in the 1900s.

17:59.931 --> 18:01.371
They all knew about Silas

18:01.411 --> 18:02.921
and that he needed to stay buried.

18:04.121 --> 18:05.891
I actually hold witches
in high esteem.

18:06.061 --> 18:07.581
Yeah, but why Silas?

18:08.311 --> 18:09.711
Why are you so afraid of him?

18:10.651 --> 18:12.560
They said if Silas rises,

18:12.561 --> 18:13.901
he'll unleash hell on earth.

18:15.661 --> 18:17.541
I happen to like earth just the way it is.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.591
That's pretty Biblical.

18:21.241 --> 18:23.161
Well, that's the other
problem with people today.

18:23.801 --> 18:24.941
They've lost faith,

18:25.751 --> 18:29.841
and in that loss, they no longer
know who they should fear.

18:36.651 --> 18:37.799
I have to get to Elena.

18:37.800 --> 18:38.771
Have you seen my phone?

18:38.971 --> 18:41.531
I've got your phone, and
I've got your car keys.

18:41.691 --> 18:44.571
And I told you we are
having a family meeting.

18:44.711 --> 18:46.399
Is that something you read in a book?

18:46.400 --> 18:48.619
Because we have never had a family meeting.

18:48.620 --> 18:49.901
I've let this go on long enough.

18:50.421 --> 18:53.501
Shane said you and your magic
are like a ticking time bomb.

18:53.502 --> 18:55.401
And I told you he's crazy.

18:55.471 --> 18:56.921
I lost your mother to witchcraft.

18:58.261 --> 18:59.511
I don't intend to lose you.

19:00.091 --> 19:02.451
It's not your life. It's mine.

19:11.131 --> 19:12.531
Hey, is Bonnie here?

19:12.651 --> 19:13.391
She's busy.

19:14.671 --> 19:15.861
It's important.

19:16.011 --> 19:16.841
What's going on?

19:17.041 --> 19:18.691
I've called you, like, a hundred times.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.131
Kol is in our house.

19:20.621 --> 19:22.451
- I have to go. - I said no.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.571
Stop telling me what to do!

19:31.131 --> 19:33.051
No one's going anywhere!

19:34.411 --> 19:35.221
Mom?

19:36.881 --> 19:38.911
Abby, please come in.

19:49.061 --> 19:50.261
What are you doing here?

19:50.421 --> 19:53.301
Your father called. Who's Professor Shane?

19:53.431 --> 19:54.919
What has he been teaching you?

19:54.920 --> 19:56.219
Bonnie, we don't have time for this.

19:56.220 --> 19:57.771
This is a family matter.

19:57.861 --> 20:00.989
My sister's in trouble.
We need Bonnie's help.

20:00.990 --> 20:03.881
My daughter is done
helping Elena Gilbert.

20:03.961 --> 20:05.821
- Now get out. - Mom!

20:05.971 --> 20:07.261
Answer my question.

20:07.381 --> 20:09.541
What lies has this professor
been telling you?

20:11.011 --> 20:13.860
Don't! Jeremy!
Hey, stop!

20:13.861 --> 20:14.801
Stop.

20:16.281 --> 20:18.101
Don't hurt her.
She's my mom.

20:19.771 --> 20:21.351
Look at me.

20:29.321 --> 20:30.771
Just go, Okay?

20:31.301 --> 20:32.201
I'm right behind you.

20:38.021 --> 20:39.151
You wanna talk?

20:41.211 --> 20:42.181
Let's talk.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.301
But I think this is a good year.

20:52.481 --> 20:54.061
What if I said
I don't believe you?

20:55.491 --> 20:58.761
Ok, you got me. I don't know
anything about wine.

21:01.641 --> 21:03.499
Just seems odd that
you being so willing

21:03.500 --> 21:05.161
to give up something
you want so much.

21:07.661 --> 21:09.681
I would do anything
for my brother.

21:10.491 --> 21:12.531
And if what you're saying
about Silas is true.

21:12.951 --> 21:14.631
What does it matter what I want

21:14.641 --> 21:16.531
if it puts everyone else
in danger?

21:19.421 --> 21:22.631
Well, this has been a enlightening.

21:23.061 --> 21:24.431
Thanks for the drinks.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.491
I'll take your request
for truth under advisement.

21:35.361 --> 21:38.651
Is there any chance that
you can be wrong about Silas?

21:41.191 --> 21:42.741
Trust me, Elena.

21:43.151 --> 21:44.861
Some things are better left buried.

21:54.841 --> 21:57.731
Think I saw a horror movie
that started just like this.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.851
Did you know they play movies
on TV all night long now?

22:01.852 --> 22:03.471
Hundreds of them.

22:03.711 --> 22:05.499
So much better than those silly

22:05.500 --> 22:07.851
black-and-white picture
shows we use to go to.

22:10.711 --> 22:11.821
I don't know.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.401
Kind of miss the old ones.

22:14.661 --> 22:16.381
You got any requests for the DJ?

22:17.871 --> 22:20.381
I'll let you pick. Nothing cheesy.

22:20.951 --> 22:23.731
Oh, that leaves out about half the decade.

22:26.871 --> 22:29.281
- Hope you like the cure. - Funny.

22:30.431 --> 22:32.491
So is everything
about the eighties so...

22:33.981 --> 22:35.221
excessive?

22:35.591 --> 22:37.031
I think, it had its charm.

22:37.901 --> 22:39.291
"Say anything"--

22:39.441 --> 22:41.509
Lloyd Dobler standing outside
of a bedroom window

22:41.510 --> 22:42.991
with a boombox over his head

22:43.291 --> 22:45.441
desperately trying to get back
the girl of his dreams.

22:46.151 --> 22:47.421
"Princess Bride"--

22:47.601 --> 22:49.941
Wesley slays giant rats for love.

22:50.551 --> 22:52.289
"Breakfast Club"-- one detention

22:52.290 --> 22:54.371
turns a bunch of outcasts into allies.

22:56.751 --> 22:59.731
So it was a decade of
sentimental drivel, as well.

22:59.831 --> 23:03.261
Well, I was gonna
say love, friendship,

23:04.001 --> 23:05.651
Possibility of anything happening.

23:07.061 --> 23:08.981
You would've loved it.

23:09.541 --> 23:10.770
And why is that?

23:10.771 --> 23:13.311
Because, as much as we
both hate to admit it,

23:14.541 --> 23:16.051
we care about those things.

23:24.011 --> 23:25.811
That better not be a corsage.

23:26.141 --> 23:27.851
I loathe corsages.

23:28.241 --> 23:32.091
These were all the rage in the eighties.

23:45.041 --> 23:46.271
Let's dance.

24:16.581 --> 24:18.190
I'm sorry. He left.

24:18.191 --> 24:20.741
I mean, I tried to stall
as long as I could.

24:23.201 --> 24:25.161
That's Bonnie. She was right behind me.

24:29.821 --> 24:31.891
I've considered
your request for truce.

24:34.191 --> 24:35.481
Request denied.

24:36.731 --> 24:38.891
I'm sorry. I've already
been invited in.

24:43.951 --> 24:45.211
Hide and seek?

24:45.371 --> 24:46.601
Fine by me.

24:48.901 --> 24:50.139
Dad needs to mind
his own business,

24:50.140 --> 24:51.769
he had no right to call you here.

24:51.770 --> 24:53.521
It's not just your father, Bonnie.

24:53.631 --> 24:55.589
Witches talk. Word gets around.

24:55.590 --> 24:57.399
I found a new way to practice.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.689
It's unconventional,
but I can handle myself, I promise.

25:00.690 --> 25:02.079
That's not what Shane said.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.731
Shane is sitting
in a jail cell right now.

25:03.741 --> 25:05.511
You're gonna take
his word over mine?

25:05.551 --> 25:07.909
I've warned you
about dark magic before.

25:07.910 --> 25:11.071
It's not dark magic.
It's expression, and I need it.

25:13.021 --> 25:15.161
They found a cure, Mom.

25:16.081 --> 25:18.041
There's a cure for vampirism,

25:18.811 --> 25:21.101
and I can
do the spell to access it.

25:21.801 --> 25:25.361
I can save you,
but I have to go...

25:26.591 --> 25:27.811
Now.

25:28.871 --> 25:30.721
I'm not the one
that needs to be saved.

25:32.551 --> 25:33.831
You are.

25:43.871 --> 25:46.701
Your brother's lack of
communication is infuriating.

25:47.141 --> 25:48.881
It's one of his trademarks,

25:49.011 --> 25:50.871
like his brooding and his hair.

25:51.241 --> 25:52.651
I don't understand
what's taking so long.

25:52.661 --> 25:54.909
I mean, how hard is it
to steal a dagger?

25:54.910 --> 25:56.736
From the vampire
who's been stabbed by it

25:56.761 --> 25:57.980
as many times as your sister,

25:57.981 --> 25:59.511
I'd say difficult.

26:04.951 --> 26:06.081
Sweet.

26:08.861 --> 26:10.511
You disappoint me, Damon.

26:11.321 --> 26:13.269
You're not trying very hard
to get out of here.

26:13.270 --> 26:15.321
I expected more the daring escape artist,

26:15.331 --> 26:16.771
less the cell potato.

26:16.811 --> 26:18.649
Well, I am compelled to kill Jeremy,

26:18.650 --> 26:19.999
so I figured it's probably smarter

26:20.000 --> 26:21.999
to sit in there
and chitchat with you

26:22.000 --> 26:23.951
than try to bust out of here
like the Hulk.

26:24.131 --> 26:26.461
How do you think Elena
felt about that, by the way.

26:27.241 --> 26:30.569
Your inability to overcome
Kol's compulsion for a single moment,

26:30.570 --> 26:32.009
even though it meant
killing the person

26:32.010 --> 26:33.591
she loves the most in the world?

26:34.081 --> 26:35.391
She's met me.

26:35.571 --> 26:38.321
She knows impulse control
is not my strong suit.

26:38.322 --> 26:41.010
Still, must be hard

26:41.011 --> 26:42.661
trying to live up to Stefan.

26:44.941 --> 26:47.991
I remember when I compelled
him to feed on Elena,

26:48.341 --> 26:51.291
he fought so hard,
he actually managed to resist.

26:52.721 --> 26:54.121
Now, that's love.

26:54.521 --> 26:56.101
What do you know about love?

26:56.351 --> 26:58.061
I know that you're
in love with Elena,

26:59.401 --> 27:01.109
but I think you're afraid
of what might happen

27:01.110 --> 27:03.211
when we find the cure
at the end of the rainbow.

27:03.351 --> 27:06.611
Personally, I don't see
a fairy-tale ending for you?

27:08.251 --> 27:11.561
All I see is Stefan and Elena.

27:14.571 --> 27:16.311
I think you see the same thing.

27:23.351 --> 27:26.081
Well, if it isn't the
happy homicidal maniac.

27:26.281 --> 27:28.889
Do you know that your
darling former blood bag

27:28.890 --> 27:30.370
and her brother
are trying to kill me?

27:30.431 --> 27:31.040
What?

27:31.041 --> 27:32.399
Don't pretend like
you're not in on it.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.349
Your obsession to find the cure

27:34.350 --> 27:36.931
clearly trumps any sibling
loyalty you once felt.

27:37.101 --> 27:38.829
I don't know what you're talking about.

27:38.830 --> 27:40.431
I'm going to rip off Jeremy's arm

27:40.432 --> 27:42.721
and kill Elena just for sport.

27:43.021 --> 27:44.421
Then I'm coming for you.

27:57.471 --> 27:58.861
What the hell is going on?

27:59.271 --> 28:00.381
I don't know.

28:00.421 --> 28:02.211
What are Stefan
and Elena planning?

28:02.212 --> 28:03.300
I don't know.

28:03.301 --> 28:05.901
I've been stuck in the penalty box
with you since yesterday.

28:06.611 --> 28:07.689
Stefan won't talk to me,

28:07.690 --> 28:08.821
And Elena won't come to see me.

28:08.822 --> 28:12.751
So maybe you're right.
Maybe she's written me off.

28:14.221 --> 28:16.391
Tell me what you know.

28:17.301 --> 28:19.141
I don't know anything about a plan.

28:22.431 --> 28:24.241
You stay here till I return.

28:29.391 --> 28:31.381
I will stay here until you return...

28:35.631 --> 28:37.071
or not.

28:51.731 --> 28:55.381
It's amazing which you can find
stashed away in the teachers' lounge.

28:55.891 --> 28:58.211
This song is not as terrible
as the other ones.

28:58.591 --> 29:02.631
This song is the Godfather
of rock anthems, ok?

29:02.891 --> 29:03.991
What's going on with you?

29:03.992 --> 29:06.871
You're... fun tonight.

29:07.001 --> 29:08.489
I can't listen to this music

29:08.490 --> 29:10.441
without thinking of my best friend Lexi.

29:11.891 --> 29:13.671
We spent most of the eighties together.

29:13.681 --> 29:16.039
I remember this one time
she snuck us backstage

29:16.040 --> 29:18.249
and compelled half the band
to do tequila shots

29:18.250 --> 29:19.641
with us before the show.

29:19.881 --> 29:22.181
She was fearless, kind of like you.

29:23.781 --> 29:25.801
So you slept with her, too?

29:26.541 --> 29:28.091
No. It wasn't like that.

29:29.061 --> 29:31.691
I was just a better person
when I was with her.

29:32.711 --> 29:34.581
I didn't think
I'd ever feel that way again.

29:35.831 --> 29:37.181
Until Elena.

29:39.581 --> 29:40.871
Until Elena.

29:42.291 --> 29:44.241
And now that's over.

29:47.901 --> 29:49.291
That look right there,

29:49.711 --> 29:51.731
that is why I don't let myself care.

29:53.851 --> 29:54.921
Well, you can say that,

29:54.931 --> 29:57.491
But we both know
it's not true.

30:03.751 --> 30:04.871
Don't worry.

30:05.061 --> 30:06.821
I'll protect you if Kol tracks his way

30:06.822 --> 30:08.531
to this abandoned dance.

30:18.851 --> 30:20.111
I think I'll choose next song.

30:20.121 --> 30:22.641
No. You know what?
I've a better idea.

30:25.361 --> 30:26.351
That way.

30:34.601 --> 30:35.921
Will, you coming?

31:00.297 --> 31:01.400
Uh!

31:01.401 --> 31:02.491
Missed.

31:05.271 --> 31:06.251
Go!

31:07.071 --> 31:09.039
Aah! Uh!

31:35.981 --> 31:39.181
Now, About that arm.

32:01.611 --> 32:02.651
Like that!

32:04.461 --> 32:05.780
This is ridiculous.

32:05.781 --> 32:08.359
Well, that's the whole point
of the "Breakfast Club" slide.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.191
It's supposed to be ridiculous.

32:11.951 --> 32:13.091
No. That's--

32:14.161 --> 32:14.849
That's cheating.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.879
What is fun about hurtling down a hallway

32:16.880 --> 32:18.431
like a teenage imbecile?

32:18.471 --> 32:20.191
You're just gonna have
to do it to find out.

32:31.301 --> 32:32.621
All right. It's the shoes.

32:32.671 --> 32:35.961
Take off your shoes, you'll be fine, ok?

32:52.951 --> 32:54.361
This is what you want right?

32:58.261 --> 32:59.351
Go ahead.

32:59.771 --> 33:00.971
Take care.

33:06.441 --> 33:08.101
You're right, I do care.

33:08.491 --> 33:10.980
I want stupid koala corsages

33:10.981 --> 33:12.501
and a prom.

33:12.631 --> 33:15.240
I want to have kids with someone

33:15.241 --> 33:16.491
who loves me enough to stand

33:16.501 --> 33:18.531
outside my window with a stupid boombox.

33:20.611 --> 33:21.891
I want to be human.

33:28.091 --> 33:30.041
So let Klaus put down my brother.

33:30.611 --> 33:32.091
Let's go find the cure.

33:44.621 --> 33:45.891
Come on, let's go.

34:02.301 --> 34:03.411
You dragged her?

34:05.391 --> 34:06.831
Just enough to keep her down

34:07.161 --> 34:08.880
until I can get some witches here

34:08.900 --> 34:10.699
to clean her mind from that poison

34:10.699 --> 34:12.331
that professor has been teaching her.

34:13.081 --> 34:14.271
That's not happening.

34:15.761 --> 34:16.920
Bonnie, please.

34:19.228 --> 34:21.228
Aah! Oh!
Bonnie--

34:23.511 --> 34:25.661
I don't belong to
the spirits anymore.

34:27.420 --> 34:30.291
I belong to myself. Sorry.

34:47.670 --> 34:50.311
Now, like I said, I don't
fancy the hunter's curse.

34:50.321 --> 34:53.391
So I'm just gonna chop off
your arm, but don't worry.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.360
I'll heal you right up with
a bit of blood after.

34:56.710 --> 34:57.881
Sorry about the sting.

34:59.991 --> 35:02.561
Now, which arm is it? Is it left or right?

35:03.151 --> 35:04.721
I'll just chop off both to be safe.

35:25.881 --> 35:27.271
Jeremy! Now!

36:09.711 --> 36:10.841
What did you do?

36:11.481 --> 36:12.791
We didn't have a choice.

36:13.051 --> 36:15.081
He was trying to cut off Jeremy's arm.

36:15.082 --> 36:16.371
Lies.

36:16.421 --> 36:17.109
He never would've gotten

36:17.110 --> 36:19.319
inside if you hadn't have
set a trap for him.

36:19.320 --> 36:21.141
You said you were gonna
put him down, too.

36:21.142 --> 36:24.531
I was gonna make him
suffer on my terms!

36:28.641 --> 36:30.841
I want to burn this house
to the ground,

36:31.661 --> 36:34.101
and then when you try
to flee for your lives,

36:34.181 --> 36:35.939
I'll kill you both without blinking.

36:35.940 --> 36:37.689
You kill us, you'll never
get to the cure.

36:37.690 --> 36:40.141
You'll never be able to make
any more hybrids.

36:40.151 --> 36:44.001
You really think I care for an instant
about my bloody hybrids?

36:44.341 --> 36:46.239
I want the cure so I can destroy it.

36:46.240 --> 36:48.479
I would've killed you all
the second we dug it up,

36:48.480 --> 36:50.951
but now I'm just gonna watch
you burn instead.

36:55.921 --> 36:57.011
Invite him in.

36:57.741 --> 36:58.841
Do it.

37:05.451 --> 37:06.471
Come in.

37:09.461 --> 37:11.121
Living room. Go.

37:28.591 --> 37:31.340
Witch, you can't do this to me.

37:31.341 --> 37:33.851
You have no idea what I can do now.

37:34.831 --> 37:38.491
I will hunt all of you
to your end!

37:39.881 --> 37:42.451
Do you hear me? Do you?

37:50.211 --> 37:51.481
I don't believe you.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.311
Kol is not dead. He can't be.

37:55.331 --> 37:57.569
Listen, Rebekah.
They didn't have a choice.

37:57.570 --> 37:59.661
Kol started this when
he went after Jeremy.

37:59.921 --> 38:01.741
He went after you, too.
Do you remember?

38:01.881 --> 38:03.791
I mean, he was never gonna
let us find the cure.

38:04.201 --> 38:05.341
So you knew.

38:05.541 --> 38:07.031
This whole night, you knew.

38:07.571 --> 38:09.772
I'm not gonna let the people
that I care about get hurt.

38:10.711 --> 38:12.981
Not Jeremy, not Elena,
not even Damon.

38:13.321 --> 38:14.801
And you can hate me for it.

38:14.931 --> 38:16.571
Now he can't hurt you, either.

38:18.121 --> 38:19.601
And I want us to find
this cure together,

38:19.602 --> 38:20.721
you and me.

38:21.391 --> 38:23.171
Not just for Elena, but for you.

38:24.321 --> 38:26.109
So you can have what you want.

38:26.110 --> 38:27.731
You can be who you want.

38:27.732 --> 38:29.671
You can be human again.

38:34.861 --> 38:36.531
Everyone deserves
a second chance right?

38:38.871 --> 38:40.281
Why would I trust you?

38:43.341 --> 38:44.451
I don't know.

38:45.961 --> 38:48.471
I guess I could give you my word,

38:50.351 --> 38:52.731
but at the end of the day
you'll just have to take a leap.

39:03.471 --> 39:04.259
Didn't work.

39:04.260 --> 39:06.781
It took time for
Finn's line to die off.

39:06.782 --> 39:09.011
Remember? It'll work.

39:09.451 --> 39:10.539
What if it doesn't?

39:10.540 --> 39:12.441
Where's that Gilbert optimism?

39:25.461 --> 39:27.311
Sorry I missed all the excitement.

39:27.321 --> 39:29.131
I'm just happy to see you.

39:38.491 --> 39:40.131
So I guess I didn't miss much.

39:43.191 --> 39:45.001
Got the Silas's headstone.

39:45.471 --> 39:48.771
We're just waiting for
Jeremy's mark to grow.

39:53.881 --> 39:56.751
- Klaus is trapped in our living room.
- Temporarily.

39:56.881 --> 39:59.881
I drawn the new moon
to bind the spell.

40:00.661 --> 40:03.661
Got three days to find
that cure, four max.

40:03.671 --> 40:05.399
If we don't, we might as well
look up Katherine Pierce

40:05.400 --> 40:07.581
and see if she wants
some company in hiding.

40:07.591 --> 40:09.061
'cuz he will come after us.

40:09.062 --> 40:10.681
We'll find it.

40:10.921 --> 40:13.061
Now we've got Rebekah taken care of,

40:13.431 --> 40:15.319
all we need is Professor Shane,

40:15.320 --> 40:16.641
and we'll have
everything we need.

40:16.642 --> 40:19.681
Yeah, I didn't uh...I didn't dagger her.

40:19.851 --> 40:22.291
What? Why not?

40:22.411 --> 40:24.311
I didn't need to, she's on our side.

40:24.581 --> 40:26.091
On our side?

40:26.481 --> 40:28.299
Did you really just say that?

40:28.300 --> 40:29.989
Yeah. She handed
over the headstone,

40:29.990 --> 40:32.491
I mean she wants to find this cure
more than anyone of us.

40:33.651 --> 40:36.281
Why would you possibly think
that you could trust her?

40:36.431 --> 40:37.889
Let me guess. She pledged her allegiance

40:37.890 --> 40:40.561
to you while you were naked in the sack.

40:49.571 --> 40:52.361
I bet you're just dying to get
that out, Weren't you Damon?

40:52.691 --> 40:54.369
Oh was this supposed to be secret?

40:54.370 --> 40:55.629
Maybe you should make that a little clearer

40:55.630 --> 40:57.531
while you're bleeding me dry in our cellar.

40:57.541 --> 40:59.541
Yeah. To keep you
from killing Jeremy.

40:59.542 --> 41:01.121
Stop it, both of you.

41:01.171 --> 41:03.211
Now why don't you tell her
to calm down, Damon?

41:04.341 --> 41:07.691
You've managed to use that sire bond
pretty well so far, haven't you?

41:23.611 --> 41:24.741
It's happening.

41:26.031 --> 41:27.281
My God.

41:29.371 --> 41:30.841
What? You can see it?

41:45.071 --> 41:46.561
Here we go.
