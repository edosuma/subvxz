02:04.740 --> 02:06.742
What was that?

02:06.743 --> 02:08.702
The faucet.

02:08.703 --> 02:10.788
It wouldn't shut up.

02:10.788 --> 02:13.665
- Did you sleep last night?
- No.

02:13.666 --> 02:16.752
I'll call Nancy
and tell her to call a plumber.

02:29.473 --> 02:32.058
[Door closes]

02:32.059 --> 02:35.896
Absolute discretion.
Can I count on that?

02:35.897 --> 02:38.941
- Always.
- Raymond Tusk.

02:38.942 --> 02:41.318
The President wants to tap him
as the new V.P.

02:41.319 --> 02:44.947
- You and I cannot let that happen.
- Why not?

02:44.948 --> 02:47.825
Because a third of his fortune
is tied up in nuclear energy.

02:47.826 --> 02:52.496
Sancorp does not want a pro-nuclear
businessman in the White House.

02:52.497 --> 02:54.748
The market is shifting
toward natural gas anyway.

02:54.749 --> 02:58.418
But Tusk wants to stall
that shift or reverse it.

02:58.419 --> 03:00.504
Vice President doesn't have
that kind of influence.

03:00.505 --> 03:03.047
This one would.
He and Walker are very close.

03:03.048 --> 03:04.925
And it's in neither
of our best interests

03:04.926 --> 03:07.213
to seep Sancorp's position
in the marketplace diminished.

03:07.214 --> 03:09.638
- What's the ask?
- Tusk won't accept the nomination

03:09.639 --> 03:11.222
if he thinks
his holdings are at risk.

03:11.223 --> 03:14.142
Sancorp needs to initiate
a hostile takeover.

03:14.143 --> 03:16.102
He's worth three times
what sancorp is.

03:16.103 --> 03:18.313
I'm talking about
the subsidiaries.

03:18.314 --> 03:20.983
We go after the companies that
refine and ship the uranium,

03:20.984 --> 03:22.776
- the support system that...
- Come on, Frank.

03:22.777 --> 03:24.778
There's stockholders
to take into account,

03:24.779 --> 03:26.196
a huge financial exposure.

03:26.197 --> 03:28.031
We just need to distract him.

03:28.032 --> 03:31.075
Send a few token salvos and
intimate there's more to come.

03:31.076 --> 03:33.495
All I'm asking
is that you speak to your client

03:33.496 --> 03:36.206
and see if this is something they
might be willing to consider.

03:36.207 --> 03:39.376
The President
announces Tusk on Friday,

03:39.377 --> 03:41.018
so we don't have a lot of time.

03:45.841 --> 03:48.009
- I'll make some calls.
- Thank you, Remy.

03:53.056 --> 03:54.725
[Door opens, closes]

03:54.726 --> 03:57.895
If he doesn't deliver,
I'm an invader without an army.

03:57.896 --> 04:00.188
If he does,
I've got a fighting chance.

04:00.189 --> 04:05.109
I just didn't feel that we could work
together constructively any longer.

04:05.110 --> 04:07.278
I think that's
a perfectly legitimate reason...

04:07.279 --> 04:08.906
Of course it is.

04:08.907 --> 04:11.783
But what you can't do is
fire someone for being pregnant.

04:11.784 --> 04:13.243
Is that what she's saying?

04:13.244 --> 04:16.413
Ms. Cole claims
that you said,

04:16.414 --> 04:19.041
quote,
"I need employees, not mothers,"

04:19.041 --> 04:22.168
and, quote,
"go focus on your baby."

04:22.169 --> 04:24.170
Can I see that?

04:24.171 --> 04:28.050
That's completely false.
I...

04:28.051 --> 04:30.176
- I never said that.
- She claims you did.

04:30.177 --> 04:33.304
It's her word against mine,
right?

04:33.305 --> 04:36.819
Well, juries are very sympathetic
with expecting mothers.

04:38.309 --> 04:40.228
This is extortion.

04:40.229 --> 04:41.939
We don't want this
going to trial, Claire.

04:41.940 --> 04:44.482
You and your husband
are public figures.

04:44.483 --> 04:46.860
This will result
in some very bad press.

04:46.861 --> 04:51.281
I suggest we go back to them
with a settlement offer.

04:53.617 --> 04:55.866
- We need the arrest record.
- There isn't any.

04:55.867 --> 04:58.573
- They let him go.
- Then we need to know who got him off.

04:58.574 --> 05:00.624
If Underwood was involved,

05:00.625 --> 05:03.752
we are talking abuse of powers
and corruption.

05:03.753 --> 05:05.128
I checked.

05:05.129 --> 05:07.798
There's no files,
no mug shot, nothing.

05:07.799 --> 05:10.842
Then we need to find the cop
who pulled him over,

05:10.843 --> 05:14.012
or somebody who saw him
come into the station.

05:14.013 --> 05:16.681
But D.C. cops...
they look after each other.

05:16.682 --> 05:18.558
We need to be careful.

05:18.559 --> 05:20.143
Do you have any sources
on the force?

05:20.144 --> 05:22.437
Not that I would trust
with something like this.

05:22.438 --> 05:24.522
You know, Lucas started out
on the crime beat.

05:24.523 --> 05:26.441
I can see if he knows anyone.

05:26.442 --> 05:28.485
- Would he help us?
- I don't know.

05:28.486 --> 05:30.904
- Maybe.
- Help out a competitor?

05:31.989 --> 05:33.939
We... stayed in touch.

05:36.220 --> 05:38.453
[Scoffs]

05:38.454 --> 05:41.999
You've gotta be kidding me.
[Chuckles]

05:42.000 --> 05:44.626
This town is way too incestuous.

05:44.627 --> 05:46.294
I know it's a lot to ask.

05:46.295 --> 05:49.089
I'm still trying to wrap
my head around the affair, Zoe.

05:49.090 --> 05:52.759
If you could just give me a
contact and maybe vouch for me...

05:52.760 --> 05:54.469
Did you wait
to bring this up until now

05:54.470 --> 05:56.387
because you thought
it'd be harder for me to say no?

05:56.388 --> 05:59.683
- What do you mean?
- In bed, right after we...

05:59.684 --> 06:02.477
You don't actually think
I would do something like...

06:02.478 --> 06:05.480
- It sure seems that way.
- This is huge, Lucas.

06:05.481 --> 06:07.440
I'm trying to avoid
fucking up what we have...

06:07.441 --> 06:09.901
Whatever that is... and you're
making it really hard for me.

06:09.902 --> 06:12.320
I don't know that I'll ever be the
kind of person that makes it easy.

06:12.321 --> 06:15.197
I'm not looking for easy. But
I don't need to be reminded of him.

06:15.198 --> 06:18.326
- I can't erase what I did.
- I know you can't.

06:18.327 --> 06:21.181
But this is really
fucking manipulative.

06:28.545 --> 06:31.339
Did you mean
what you said the other night?

06:31.340 --> 06:33.899
That you probably...

06:38.638 --> 06:41.050
I don't know what to do
when I hear something like that.

06:43.601 --> 06:48.044
That's why I was so quiet when
you drove me to the airport.

06:50.441 --> 06:54.654
I was angry.
I just blurted it out.

06:54.655 --> 06:57.199
I wish I hadn't.
At least not like that.

06:57.200 --> 07:00.154
I'm not trying to take advantage
of you because you did.

07:04.039 --> 07:06.332
- He hasn't said a word.
- And you haven't brought it up?

07:06.333 --> 07:08.376
I just asked him if he was still
considering Tusk.

07:08.377 --> 07:10.837
He said yes, but that he wanted
to speak to you first. That's it.

07:10.838 --> 07:12.964
I wish we knew
if they'd spoken at all.

07:12.965 --> 07:16.426
Well, he has a private line.
I can't track those calls.

07:17.249 --> 07:18.970
- Frank.
- Mr. President.

07:18.971 --> 07:20.847
Tell me about St. Louis.

07:20.848 --> 07:24.517
He's a hard man to read.
I did my best to probe him,

07:24.518 --> 07:26.978
but I don't think I left any
wiser to which way he's leaning.

07:26.979 --> 07:32.067
I must say, though, I think he is
by far and away the best candidate.

07:32.068 --> 07:34.111
Why do you say that?

07:34.112 --> 07:38.500
Doesn't it make sense for you to
nominate someone you know so well?

07:38.501 --> 07:40.825
I don't know him.
That's why I sent you to St. Louis.

07:40.826 --> 07:42.869
Forgive me, Mr. President.
I didn't mean it that way.

07:42.870 --> 07:45.622
I meant that the world
knows so well.

07:45.623 --> 07:47.916
You, me, everyone
knows Raymond Tusk.

07:47.917 --> 07:49.709
We don't need to convince anyone
of his worthiness.

07:49.710 --> 07:51.502
But you said
he still seems ambivalent?

07:51.503 --> 07:54.172
Which is why I think you should
make a personal overture.

07:54.173 --> 07:56.133
Invite him to the White House.

07:56.134 --> 07:57.534
Well, I don't want
to appear desperate.

07:57.535 --> 07:58.635
I agree with Frank.

07:58.636 --> 08:00.929
Inviting him
is a very good idea.

08:00.930 --> 08:03.265
If you're serious about Tusk,
you should wine and dine him.

08:03.266 --> 08:05.231
Make him feel very special.

08:05.232 --> 08:07.060
I'm sure we can find time
in the schedule.

08:07.061 --> 08:09.395
- Let's give him a few more days.
- We have less than a week, sir.

08:09.396 --> 08:11.355
I wouldn't wait
any later than Friday.

08:11.356 --> 08:14.234
We can make Friday work, sir.

08:14.235 --> 08:16.569
All right. Well,
let's see if he's available.

08:16.570 --> 08:18.822
[Knocking on door]

08:25.745 --> 08:27.914
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

08:29.415 --> 08:31.334
- Give me your phone.
- Why?

08:31.335 --> 08:32.683
Just give it to me.

09:02.115 --> 09:04.075
[Quietly] Have you noticed
anything weird in here?

09:04.076 --> 09:05.743
Stuff moved around?
Anything missing?

09:05.744 --> 09:07.912
- No.
- Anyone following you?

09:07.913 --> 09:10.373
What did you find out?

09:10.374 --> 09:12.334
This is serious, Zoe.

09:12.335 --> 09:15.586
It goes way up,
as high as the commissioner.

09:15.587 --> 09:18.464
I had to beg my contact at Metro
to give me this.

09:20.591 --> 09:22.552
No record of Russo
getting pulled over,

09:22.553 --> 09:25.013
but he remembers there was a
call girl brought in with Russo.

09:25.014 --> 09:28.350
That's a file
on one of her previous arrests.

09:28.351 --> 09:31.895
I've investigated
police cover-ups before.

09:31.896 --> 09:34.480
I got death threats
for a year.

09:34.481 --> 09:37.650
Are you willing to take
that risk?

09:37.651 --> 09:38.943
Yeah.

09:38.944 --> 09:41.029
[Frank]
How long?

09:41.030 --> 09:43.198
[Remy] The next board of directors
meeting is three weeks from now.

09:43.199 --> 09:44.908
That is too late.
Remy, look,

09:44.909 --> 09:46.743
the President is gonna
nominate Tusk in a week or less.

09:46.744 --> 09:48.245
I've urged Scott Cunningham
to call a special meeting,

09:48.246 --> 09:50.413
but that doesn't happen
overnight.

09:50.414 --> 09:52.916
There's a lot of machinery in
a corporate attack like this.

09:52.917 --> 09:54.876
I want to meet
Scott Cunningham myself.

09:54.877 --> 09:57.170
I'm not sitting you down with
Scott. You know the rules.

09:57.171 --> 09:59.047
These are extraordinary
circumstances.

09:59.048 --> 10:00.715
Frank, Sancorp's officers

10:00.716 --> 10:02.300
do not meet with politicians,
period.

10:02.301 --> 10:04.135
You talk to me,
I talk to Scott Cunningham,

10:04.136 --> 10:05.720
and vice versa.
That's how it works.

10:05.721 --> 10:07.138
All right, Remy.
Whatever you think best.

10:07.139 --> 10:08.973
I'll call you
when I know more.

10:08.974 --> 10:10.934
Nancy!

10:10.935 --> 10:14.354
Of all the things I hold in high
regard, rules are not one of them.

10:14.355 --> 10:17.190
I will not place my fate solely
in the hands of the middleman

10:17.191 --> 10:19.483
if I can go directly
to the supplier.

10:19.484 --> 10:22.195
Book a flight to Atlanta.
Tomorrow morning. Let Meechum know.

10:22.196 --> 10:24.017
Yes, sir.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.325
She grew up
in Lynchburg, Virginia,

10:27.326 --> 10:29.286
went to Lorimer High School

10:29.287 --> 10:31.329
until she dropped out
sophomore year,

10:31.330 --> 10:33.373
and then after that,
there's no public record.

10:33.374 --> 10:35.792
But all it says here
is that she was fined $300

10:35.793 --> 10:38.420
for loitering on April 2012.

10:38.421 --> 10:40.255
One of us
has to go to Lynchburg.

10:40.256 --> 10:43.925
- Parents, classmates, teachers...
- I'll do it.

10:43.926 --> 10:47.717
Okay. Well, then, you and I
have to call escort services.

10:47.718 --> 10:50.932
I'm willing to lend a hand, but not
by making cold calls 12 hours a day

10:50.933 --> 10:52.570
just to get hung up on
by hookers.

10:52.571 --> 10:54.227
Where was she arrested?

10:54.228 --> 10:56.604
- Connecticut ave.
- [Janine] 2460.

10:58.189 --> 11:00.733
That's the address
of the district grand hotel.

11:15.748 --> 11:19.252
[Man] I'm not a fan
of surprise visits, Frank.

11:19.253 --> 11:20.795
[Frank]
Remy wouldn't arrange a meeting.

11:20.796 --> 11:23.840
Remy Danton exists
so we don't have to meet.

11:23.841 --> 11:26.343
I needed to speak with you.

11:26.344 --> 11:28.345
There's a congressional
travel report

11:28.346 --> 11:30.138
that puts you
on a trip to Atlanta

11:30.139 --> 11:33.099
the same day I was pulled out
of an investors' briefing.

11:33.100 --> 11:36.436
Those are the sort of
coincidences we want to avoid.

11:36.437 --> 11:39.189
Were you briefing your investors
on Raymond Tusk?

11:40.803 --> 11:42.775
Meechum can be trusted.

11:42.776 --> 11:44.694
Why would I be speaking
to them about Tusk?

11:44.695 --> 11:47.030
- I thought Remy filled you in.
- No.

11:47.031 --> 11:49.073
He didn't say anything about the
vice presidential nomination?

11:49.074 --> 11:52.076
He didn't. And I have a
feeling I'd rather not be told.

11:52.077 --> 11:53.870
Trust me,
you want to know.

11:53.871 --> 11:55.997
I've appeared in front of
grand juries before, Frank.

11:55.998 --> 11:58.540
It's much easier
when you can tell the truth.

11:58.541 --> 12:01.711
Please, don't put me in a
position where I have to lie.

12:01.712 --> 12:03.587
If Tusk
has the President's ear,

12:03.588 --> 12:05.882
you will see this administration
shift its support

12:05.883 --> 12:08.592
toward nuclear energy
and away from natural gas.

12:08.593 --> 12:11.095
His subsidiaries and his suppliers.
Go after them.

12:11.096 --> 12:13.014
Frank, we should end
this conversation right now.

12:13.015 --> 12:14.974
He will not accept
the nomination if his assets

12:14.975 --> 12:17.185
are in a blind trust and he
can't fight off the threat.

12:17.186 --> 12:18.608
- Okay, we're done.
- Scott...

12:18.609 --> 12:21.022
I don't wanna
hear another word.

12:24.193 --> 12:25.985
Go back to the airport.

12:25.986 --> 12:30.823
Figure out a good reason you
needed to be in Atlanta today.

12:30.824 --> 12:34.827
You can pull over at the next
corner. I'll have my car pick me up.

what will we leave behind?

26:32.209 --> 26:34.501
We've accomplished
a great deal.

26:34.502 --> 26:37.130
And I intend for us
to accomplish a lot more.

26:38.589 --> 26:40.216
But for whom?

26:40.217 --> 26:41.759
For each other.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.928
But if we're not...

26:48.432 --> 26:50.643
Ah, I'm being silly.

26:56.565 --> 26:58.985
Have you ever been published?

26:58.986 --> 27:01.403
Many times.

27:01.404 --> 27:03.447
I guess that's
a stupid question.

27:03.448 --> 27:06.492
You don't seem
like a starving artist.

27:06.493 --> 27:09.620
- Don't judge a book by its cover.
- [Chuckling]

27:11.538 --> 27:13.958
You have a nice laugh.

27:15.501 --> 27:17.044
Really?

27:17.045 --> 27:19.379
It's very attractive.

27:20.422 --> 27:22.675
Are you staying at the hotel?

27:22.676 --> 27:25.678
You want to come up
to my room?

27:25.679 --> 27:28.264
That depends.

27:30.474 --> 27:33.144
Well, how much
would that cost me?

27:34.561 --> 27:36.897
That seems about right.

27:38.123 --> 27:40.193
Close your eyes.

27:41.610 --> 27:44.113
Put out your hands.

27:47.741 --> 27:49.754
Now open them up.

27:51.078 --> 27:53.247
I'm trying to find
this woman.

27:53.248 --> 27:55.708
If you make me
pull out my badge,

27:55.709 --> 27:58.085
I have to take you in.

27:58.086 --> 28:00.254
But I don't want
to do that.

28:01.255 --> 28:04.091
Let's not make a scene.

28:14.768 --> 28:17.355
I used to see her around.

28:17.356 --> 28:19.940
She left the business, though.
We haven't really kept in touch.

28:19.941 --> 28:21.901
Any idea where she might be?

28:21.902 --> 28:25.445
A friend of mine
saw her waiting tables

28:25.446 --> 28:27.948
at a restaurant
in Georgetown.

28:30.076 --> 28:33.204
I guess the question
I'm trying to ask is, um...

28:33.205 --> 28:34.788
Is it even worth that step?

28:37.612 --> 28:41.616
The bottom line is that for a woman
your age, it's extremely hard.

28:41.617 --> 28:43.493
Have you ever had a miscarriage?

28:43.494 --> 28:45.078
No. I, um...

28:45.079 --> 28:47.914
I've been late before,
but I don't...

28:47.915 --> 28:50.334
You know, I don't know.
I don't know exactly.

28:50.335 --> 28:53.170
Have you had any abortions?

28:54.587 --> 28:56.256
Three.

28:57.423 --> 29:00.719
That can make it
more difficult.

29:00.720 --> 29:03.638
I'm not trying to dissuade you,

29:03.639 --> 29:07.351
but please make sure you think
long and hard before you decide.

29:07.352 --> 29:09.477
But it's possible?

29:09.478 --> 29:12.189
Assuming you and your husband
fit all the criteria?

29:12.190 --> 29:14.524
Yes, it's possible.

29:16.693 --> 29:18.945
Okay.

29:18.946 --> 29:23.367
[Francis] What?
Well, that's hardly my problem.

29:23.368 --> 29:25.035
- No, you get on it. It's...
- [Knocks]

29:25.036 --> 29:27.453
I have to call you back.
What is it?

29:27.454 --> 29:29.622
Sancorp's stock.

29:29.623 --> 29:33.459
It's up 35%
in the last four hours.

29:34.627 --> 29:37.172
It's all over
the financial news.

29:39.216 --> 29:41.551
Tusk is making a play.

29:41.552 --> 29:43.970
Get Remy on the phone.

29:45.931 --> 29:48.850
Congressman Underwood
on line three.

29:48.851 --> 29:50.727
I was just about to call you.

29:50.728 --> 29:53.813
I need to meet with Tusk before
he sees the President tonight.

29:53.814 --> 29:56.233
- He's already here.
- At the White House?

29:56.234 --> 29:58.318
He decided to come in
a few hours early.

29:58.319 --> 30:00.153
His plane landed
half an hour ago.

30:00.154 --> 30:02.239
- Do you know where he is?
- I don't know.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.366
He had his own car pick him up.
I just found out.

30:04.367 --> 30:06.659
Remy's not in his office.
I left word there and on his cell.

30:06.660 --> 30:08.759
Look, you need to call me the moment
you know where he is.

30:08.760 --> 30:09.887
Okay.

30:09.888 --> 30:12.332
It's just the lunch menu right now.
I hope that's okay.

30:12.333 --> 30:14.709
Yeah. That's fine.

30:16.420 --> 30:18.630
Your server
will be with you shortly.

30:18.631 --> 30:20.257
Is Rachel working?

30:20.258 --> 30:22.634
Uh, no. I don't think
she's scheduled till Sunday.

30:22.635 --> 30:24.469
Stephanie will be with you
this afternoon.

30:24.470 --> 30:25.971
Thanks.

30:28.348 --> 30:30.809
Should we come back Sunday?

30:36.148 --> 30:38.275
I'll be right back.

31:06.886 --> 31:10.432
Excuse me.
Can I help you with something?

31:10.433 --> 31:13.559
Yeah. I was just looking
for the bathroom.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.770
[Inaudible dialogue]

31:18.357 --> 31:21.985
Unless you want to use
the restroom in the office.

31:45.033 --> 31:47.994
- Who are you calling?
- Rachel.

31:47.995 --> 31:49.788
[Continues dialing]

31:51.790 --> 31:54.626
[Line ringing]

31:54.627 --> 31:56.336
Rachel Posner?

31:56.337 --> 31:57.962
My name is Zoe Barnes.

31:57.963 --> 32:00.423
I'm a reporter
at slugline.com.

32:00.424 --> 32:02.925
I know about Peter Russo.

32:04.720 --> 32:07.430
Rachel?

32:07.431 --> 32:08.973
- [Beeps]
- [Mouths word]

32:11.810 --> 32:15.021
[Beeps]

32:15.022 --> 32:16.857
[Phone clicking]

32:24.656 --> 32:26.366
Come on, Rachel.

32:28.201 --> 32:30.285
You shouldn't have
mentioned Russo.

32:30.286 --> 32:33.164
- She'll write back.
- I wouldn't if I was her.

33:02.903 --> 33:05.321
[Footsteps]

33:21.504 --> 33:22.909
How much do you know?

33:22.910 --> 33:24.674
That you were with him
when he was pulled over.

33:24.675 --> 33:26.593
- Who else knows?
- Just me.

33:26.594 --> 33:28.678
I can keep it that way,
but I need more.

33:28.679 --> 33:31.473
- There is no more.
- You're lying.

33:33.892 --> 33:35.977
Yeah, I was with him
when he got pulled over.

33:35.978 --> 33:38.020
They took him away
and let me go.

33:38.021 --> 33:39.564
I don't know
what happened to him.

33:39.565 --> 33:40.941
He was never charged.

33:40.942 --> 33:43.359
You know more than me, then.

33:43.360 --> 33:45.612
No one ever came
to talk to you?

33:45.613 --> 33:47.697
- About what?
- To keep you quiet.

33:47.698 --> 33:50.617
You don't kiss and tell
in that business.

33:50.618 --> 33:51.993
Not even
when it's a congressman?

33:51.994 --> 33:53.829
Especially when
it's a congressman.

33:55.497 --> 33:57.624
Frank Underwood
never approached you?

33:58.959 --> 34:00.543
Who's that?

34:00.544 --> 34:03.004
You're too smart
to play dumb, Rachel.

34:03.005 --> 34:04.798
You know who that is.

34:06.090 --> 34:08.092
Name rings a bell.

34:08.092 --> 34:10.428
I try not to follow the news.

34:10.429 --> 34:13.723
Too many familiar faces.

34:13.724 --> 34:15.391
How about Douglas stamper?

34:15.391 --> 34:18.353
Never heard of him.

34:18.353 --> 34:20.938
I've told you
everything I know.

34:22.983 --> 34:25.109
I know about
what your father did.

34:25.110 --> 34:28.362
If you don't help me,
I'll write about Russo.

34:28.364 --> 34:30.782
I'll write
that you were a prostitute,

34:30.783 --> 34:34.159
and I'll write about
why you left home.

34:34.161 --> 34:36.036
Go to town, bitch.

34:58.029 --> 35:00.228
So?

35:00.229 --> 35:02.856
She mentioned both you
and your boss.

35:02.857 --> 35:05.274
- What exactly?
- She didn't say.

35:05.275 --> 35:08.737
All she seemed to know was that I was in
the car with him when he got pulled over.

35:08.738 --> 35:11.280
And you didn't admit
to more than that?

35:11.281 --> 35:13.199
No. I said everything
exactly like you told me to.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.660
- You really think I'd spill my guts?
- Calm down.

35:15.661 --> 35:18.496
Why didn't you tell me he was gonna
hurt himself? I never would've done it.

35:18.497 --> 35:20.415
How could I have known?

35:20.416 --> 35:23.459
- I just want all this to go away.
- It will.

35:23.460 --> 35:25.879
All of it.

35:25.880 --> 35:28.172
I promise.

35:28.173 --> 35:31.426
[Car engine starts]

35:37.057 --> 35:39.017
[Automatic dialing]

35:39.018 --> 35:40.142
[Line ringing]

35:46.608 --> 35:48.359
Do you want me
to order you dinner?

35:48.360 --> 35:51.029
- Where's Doug at?
- I don't know. He left early.

35:51.030 --> 35:54.783
- Call him for me, will you?
- Yes, sir.

35:55.700 --> 35:57.410
Thirteen minutes from now,

35:57.411 --> 35:59.120
Tusk will meet
with the President,

35:59.121 --> 36:01.039
if he isn't there already.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.833
You've never been an ally,
have you?

36:03.834 --> 36:06.878
Pressing on with your slow,
incessant march.

36:08.212 --> 36:11.299
Time would've killed Russo
if I hadn't,

36:11.300 --> 36:13.843
just as it
will kill me someday.

36:13.844 --> 36:15.595
Kill us all.

36:15.596 --> 36:18.014
Sir, I just got
Doug's voicemail.

36:18.932 --> 36:20.391
I wonder where he's at.

36:20.392 --> 36:21.392
[Phone chiming]

36:21.393 --> 36:23.686
Well, maybe this is him.

36:25.313 --> 36:26.522
[Beeps]

36:26.523 --> 36:27.857
Freddy?

36:43.372 --> 36:45.541
Sorry, Frank.
I had to trade up.

36:45.542 --> 36:49.378
Sancorp's a big fish,
but Raymond Tusk is a whale.

37:04.936 --> 37:06.855
Can I get you something,
Frank?

37:06.856 --> 37:09.107
Nothing right now.
Thank you, Freddy.

37:09.108 --> 37:11.693
I'll leave y'all to it.

37:14.946 --> 37:19.283
I hope you don't mind that Remy told
me about this little secret of yours.

37:19.284 --> 37:22.829
I wanted a place
where you'd feel comfortable.

37:25.999 --> 37:28.334
Shouldn't you be
at the White House?

37:28.335 --> 37:33.089
How could I pass up the chance to
eat the best ribs in Washington?

37:33.090 --> 37:34.883
Mm-mm-mm.

37:34.884 --> 37:37.468
Remy told you about Sancorp.

37:37.469 --> 37:41.931
As of closing bell today,
I own 3%.

37:41.932 --> 37:45.935
By the end of next week,
I'll own over ten.

37:45.936 --> 37:49.189
Enough to make sure
they can't cause me any trouble.

37:49.190 --> 37:54.069
A valiant effort, though.
I respect that.

37:54.070 --> 37:56.362
So why are we here?

37:56.363 --> 37:59.157
I told you I'd give you until
today to think things over.

37:59.158 --> 38:02.368
- I'm a man who keeps my word.
- And I'm still not interested.

38:03.942 --> 38:07.195
You wanted me to be more
specific back in St. Louis.

38:07.196 --> 38:08.822
That would be a good start.

38:17.539 --> 38:21.376
Why did Britain go to war
with China 150 years ago?

38:21.377 --> 38:23.045
I'm in no mood for riddles.

38:23.046 --> 38:26.214
Humor me a moment.

38:26.215 --> 38:29.342
- Opium.
- It was bigger than opium, Frank.

38:29.343 --> 38:31.553
That was simply the excuse.

38:31.554 --> 38:34.305
Peking wanted to call the shots
instead of the west.

38:34.306 --> 38:36.892
It's the same problem
we're facing now.

38:36.893 --> 38:41.813
But nobody wants a trade war,
much less a military one.

38:41.814 --> 38:44.440
And what's your opium?

38:44.441 --> 38:48.195
Samarium-149.
I need it for my reactors.

38:48.196 --> 38:52.365
China controls 95%
of the world's supply.

38:52.366 --> 38:55.535
And you're worried about the imbalance
in our currency, our foreign debt...

38:55.536 --> 38:58.872
- All of it.
- You already have the President's ear.

38:58.873 --> 39:00.976
Trade tariffs
are controlled by congress.

39:00.977 --> 39:03.793
You have a lot more influence
there than Garrett does.

39:03.794 --> 39:06.295
It's the reason I wanted you to
stay there in the first place.

39:06.296 --> 39:09.112
And what exactly
would you want me to do?

39:09.113 --> 39:11.198
Well, that part
I don't know yet.

39:11.199 --> 39:13.950
We'll have to wait and see how
things play out with the Chinese.

39:13.951 --> 39:17.112
I've already told you
I will not do a blank check.

39:19.873 --> 39:22.250
I must say I'm surprised,
Frank.

39:22.251 --> 39:24.585
You have a reputation
for pragmatism.

39:24.586 --> 39:28.298
And I also have avoided a
reputation for indentured servitude.

39:28.299 --> 39:32.010
I never make an offer
more than twice, Frank.

39:32.011 --> 39:34.595
Tell me now if I can count
on your cooperation.

39:34.596 --> 39:37.974
You're not offering cooperation,
you're demanding tutelage.

39:39.559 --> 39:42.145
So let me make you
a proposal.

39:42.146 --> 39:47.483
I am absolutely willing
to work together as equals.

39:47.484 --> 39:51.071
I will take your opinions seriously,
just as the President does.

39:51.072 --> 39:53.948
But I will not
bind myself to them in advance.

39:53.949 --> 39:56.201
If that doesn't interest you,
fair enough.

39:56.202 --> 39:59.704
Good luck finding a vice
President in the next four days

39:59.705 --> 40:02.123
who will prove
as pragmatic as I.

40:02.124 --> 40:04.584
You can't purchase loyalty,
Raymond.

40:04.585 --> 40:06.253
Not the sort I have in mind.

40:06.254 --> 40:09.089
If you want to earn
my loyalty,

40:09.090 --> 40:11.549
then you have to offer
yours in return.

40:11.550 --> 40:14.677
And if we can agree to that...

40:14.678 --> 40:19.599
Well, you're a man
with imagination.

40:27.065 --> 40:29.317
Wait.

40:41.329 --> 40:43.706
If stamper was there himself,

40:43.707 --> 40:47.543
this goes much deeper
than a lost arrest file.

40:49.462 --> 40:54.134
Well, let's think about this.
What did Russo gain him?

40:54.135 --> 40:55.718
A mansion in Harrisburg.

40:55.719 --> 40:59.806
Uh-uh. Underwood
thinks bigger than that.

40:59.807 --> 41:02.725
- Then what?
- I don't know.

41:02.726 --> 41:04.352
He controls Pennsylvania.

41:04.353 --> 41:05.645
He has influence
in the White House.

41:05.646 --> 41:07.230
Walker needs the state
for reelection...

41:07.231 --> 41:10.733
No. No, it can't
just be Walker.

41:10.734 --> 41:13.736
The President backstabbed him

41:13.737 --> 41:15.989
for the secretary of state
nomination.

41:15.990 --> 41:18.450
It has to be something else.

41:20.827 --> 41:22.703
The President would owe him.

41:22.704 --> 41:24.331
But what?

41:24.332 --> 41:25.623
They already meet
once a week.

41:25.624 --> 41:27.459
The education bill?
I mean, what?

41:27.460 --> 41:28.793
What specifically?

41:28.794 --> 41:30.253
He could be after
the V.P. nomination.

41:30.254 --> 41:32.255
That doesn't make sense,
though.

41:32.256 --> 41:36.009
The V.P. slot is on the table
because Russo tanked.

41:36.010 --> 41:37.635
Underwood wanted him to win.

41:40.805 --> 41:43.308
Unless he didn't.

41:43.309 --> 41:45.977
Maybe he wanted Russo
to self-destruct.

41:45.978 --> 41:47.561
To force Matthews to run.

41:47.562 --> 41:50.564
Exactly. And then next week,
when Matthews wins...

41:50.565 --> 41:52.233
The President taps Underwood.

41:57.822 --> 42:01.075
Mr. President.

42:01.076 --> 42:02.743
Mr. Tusk.

42:02.744 --> 42:04.412
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

42:04.413 --> 42:08.833
Have a seat, Frank.

42:08.834 --> 42:10.710
I have a confession to make.

42:10.711 --> 42:13.087
Raymond and I
have known each other for years.

42:13.088 --> 42:17.050
We don't publicize it, but he's
been a trusted advisor to me.

42:17.051 --> 42:20.803
And I sent you to St. Louis
so he could spend time with you,

42:20.804 --> 42:23.431
give me his two cents.

42:23.432 --> 42:26.393
On what, sir, if I may ask?

42:26.394 --> 42:29.562
Offering you
the vice presidency.

42:29.563 --> 42:35.609
I told the President that,
uh, in my humble opinion,

42:35.610 --> 42:38.654
both he and the country
would be well served

42:38.655 --> 42:45.328
by a man as experienced,
intelligent, and loyal as you.

42:47.955 --> 42:51.016
So I'm officially asking,
Frank.

42:56.630 --> 43:00.134
Sir, I... I don't know
what to say.

43:04.180 --> 43:06.224
Say yes.

43:06.225 --> 43:08.476
Yes.

43:08.477 --> 43:11.521
It would be a great honor,
Mr. President.

43:27.995 --> 43:31.791
Meechum.

43:31.792 --> 43:33.293
I take care of my own,

43:33.294 --> 43:36.463
and you've proved yourself
to be very valuable.

43:36.464 --> 43:39.048
I would like you to be
part of my security detail

43:39.049 --> 43:40.633
once I get confirmed.

43:40.634 --> 43:42.176
That's the Secret Service, sir.

43:42.177 --> 43:43.761
I'm capitol police.

43:43.762 --> 43:46.931
Then I'll put you
on the Secret Service.

43:46.932 --> 43:49.601
If you're interested.

43:49.602 --> 43:51.978
I'd be more than interested,
sir.

43:51.979 --> 43:53.813
Good.

43:53.814 --> 43:56.483
And I'm extremely grateful.

43:56.484 --> 43:57.900
Keep being valuable.

43:57.901 --> 44:00.153
That's the best way
to show your gratitude.

44:00.154 --> 44:03.948
I will,
Mr. Vice President.

44:08.995 --> 44:11.747
Did the plumber finally come?

44:11.748 --> 44:15.627
No. I fixed it.

44:15.628 --> 44:17.878
Francis.

44:21.048 --> 44:24.511
So proud of you, Francis.

44:24.512 --> 44:26.471
I didn't do it alone.

44:37.307 --> 44:39.725
I got here
as quickly as I could.

44:39.726 --> 44:41.978
Is something wrong?

44:41.979 --> 44:45.440
I need you to be completely
honest with me, Christina.

44:45.441 --> 44:47.942
About what?

44:47.943 --> 44:49.944
The other day, when I said
that you should tell me

44:49.945 --> 44:52.530
if anyone from the press
started harassing you...

44:55.950 --> 44:59.412
Zoe Barnes?

44:59.413 --> 45:01.789
You said you wanted to talk
about something on the phone.

45:01.790 --> 45:03.124
Oh, no. That can wait.

45:03.125 --> 45:05.627
No. Come on. Tell me.

45:05.628 --> 45:09.839
I, um... earlier today...

45:09.840 --> 45:11.673
The rowing machine,
I saw, is broken.

45:11.674 --> 45:13.968
Oh, it's my fault.
The cable broke.

45:13.969 --> 45:16.387
I haven't been able
to replace it yet.

45:16.388 --> 45:19.807
What about going
for a run with me?

45:22.268 --> 45:24.396
She's trying to smear
congressman Underwood.

45:25.911 --> 45:29.233
It's a coordinated campaign
by everyone at Slugline.

45:34.696 --> 45:36.407
But she knew things.

45:36.408 --> 45:37.575
Like what?

45:37.576 --> 45:39.076
About Peter.

45:39.077 --> 45:43.122
Something to do with Kern
losing the nomination.

45:43.123 --> 45:45.916
And?

45:50.921 --> 45:52.590
Want me to drive
alongside you, sir?

45:52.591 --> 45:54.050
No. You stay here.

45:54.051 --> 45:56.427
Yes, sir.

45:56.428 --> 45:57.970
You ready?

45:57.971 --> 46:00.682
Yes.
