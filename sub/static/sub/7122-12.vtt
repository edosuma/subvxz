10:38.070 --> 10:39.560
Finn, you've probably been
wondering

10:39.639 --> 10:41.698
where I've been
for the last few hours.

10:41.774 --> 10:44.140
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, I have.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.872
Finn, I was never really
your secretary, Finn.

10:46.946 --> 10:48.140
I was writing a book

10:48.214 --> 10:50.273
about how you were
a slave to my lumps

10:50.349 --> 10:51.907
'cause I'm so hot, Finn!

10:51.984 --> 10:53.246
Oh. Okay.

10:53.319 --> 10:56.015
But <i>you're</i> the one
who's hot, Finn!

10:56.088 --> 10:58.420
Wow. Uh... thanks!

10:58.491 --> 11:00.891
No. Thank <i>you.</i>

11:03.629 --> 11:06.655
LSP, you're wearing
garbage for clothes!

11:06.732 --> 11:08.825
Gotcha.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.228
