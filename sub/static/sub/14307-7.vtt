(male narrator)
Previously, on a
very special Clone High...

00:05.833 --> 00:07.833
Joan made a pass at Abe,

00:07.833 --> 00:09.900
Cleo made a pass at Joan,

00:09.900 --> 00:11.567
and Abe scored,

00:11.567 --> 00:14.133
but not on the court.

00:14.133 --> 00:16.833
I find sports metaphors
very useful

00:16.833 --> 00:19.400
for making
veiled sexual references.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.300
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

00:22.300 --> 00:25.233
* Secret government employees

00:25.233 --> 00:28.133
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

00:28.133 --> 00:31.167
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

00:31.167 --> 00:33.967
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

00:33.967 --> 00:36.800
* They're going to make it
if they try *

00:36.800 --> 00:39.800
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

00:39.800 --> 00:46.033
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *

00:46.033 --> 00:48.767
* Clone High

00:48.767 --> 00:54.400
* Clone High

00:56.267 --> 00:59.833
Abe, not here.

00:59.833 --> 01:03.400
The first kiss sets the tone
for the whole relationship.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.067
It has to be perfect.

01:05.067 --> 01:08.100
Gosh, Cleo, what else can I do
to make this perfect?

01:08.100 --> 01:11.700
I'm wearing eight magazines'
worth of Drakkar Noir.

01:11.700 --> 01:14.667
Well, I mean, I hate to bring up
my first kiss with JFK.

01:14.667 --> 01:15.667
Please don't.

01:15.667 --> 01:17.267
We were in the back of his van,

01:17.267 --> 01:20.067
parked behind the Laundromat,
empty wine coolers

01:20.067 --> 01:22.467
jabbing into our writhing
naked bodies.

01:22.467 --> 01:23.867
Naked bodies?

01:23.867 --> 01:26.400
Look, Abe, I'm the clone
of Cleopatra,

01:26.400 --> 01:28.333
the most glamorous woman
in history.

01:28.333 --> 01:30.133
I need our first kiss
to be passionate,

01:30.133 --> 01:32.133
dramatic, unexpected,
and ideally,

01:32.133 --> 01:33.600
accompanied by fireworks.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.200
[fireworks popping and hissing]

01:35.200 --> 01:37.167
You know what I'm
in the mood for right now?

01:38.300 --> 01:39.700
A salad.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.067
(Joan)
What do you mean,
you haven't kissed her yet?

01:43.067 --> 01:44.700
What about that night
at JFK's party

01:44.700 --> 01:46.667
when everyone was drinking
non-alcoholic beer?

01:46.667 --> 01:49.800
What a hilarious night.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.833
This is our first kiss
as boyfriend and girlfriend,

01:51.833 --> 01:53.167
and Cleo needs it to be perfect.

01:53.167 --> 01:55.333
But JFK used to just
park his van--

01:55.333 --> 01:56.633
Yeah, yeah.
I heard.

01:56.633 --> 01:58.633
Yeah, so did everyone
in fifth period English.

01:58.633 --> 01:59.700
She's a screamer, Abe.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.167
Enough!

02:01.167 --> 02:04.167
Man, you wanted a kiss,
but instead you got bubkes.

02:04.167 --> 02:05.167
[gasps]

02:05.167 --> 02:06.767
Kiss, bubkes.

02:06.767 --> 02:08.200
I just totally rhymed.

02:08.200 --> 02:09.633
I rhymed!

02:09.633 --> 02:11.067
Wait,
rhymed, rhymed.

02:11.067 --> 02:12.067
[gasps]

02:12.067 --> 02:13.367
I did it again!

02:13.367 --> 02:15.333
What's so great
about accidentally rhyming?

02:15.333 --> 02:18.100
There are no accidents
in rhyming, dog.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.767
You see, rhyming's
a godlike force

02:19.767 --> 02:22.200
that chooses people for stardom.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.333
It happened to Bubba Sparxxx,
and now it is happening to me.

02:25.333 --> 02:29.233
You kind of just rhymed
kiss with kiss, Gandhi.

02:29.233 --> 02:32.933
Please, call me G-Spot.

02:32.933 --> 02:33.933
Whatever.

02:33.933 --> 02:35.467
Abe, forget Cleo.

02:35.467 --> 02:37.333
I mean, if two people
are in love,

02:37.333 --> 02:42.133
the first kiss will just happen
at the right moment...

02:42.133 --> 02:44.100
like this.

02:45.167 --> 02:47.067
[laughing]

02:47.067 --> 02:48.300
Thanks, Joan.

02:48.300 --> 02:52.367
Your fake infatuation bit
never fails to amuse.

02:52.367 --> 02:54.833
You should join
an improv troupe.

02:54.833 --> 02:57.900
(Principal Scudworth)
Once I implant
these brain-wave transmitters

02:57.900 --> 03:00.933
into the clones' brains,
I will be able

03:00.933 --> 03:05.300
to see and hear everything
they taste and smell.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.767
We'll start with the As.

03:07.767 --> 03:10.533
I've got John Adams.

03:10.533 --> 03:13.100
John Quincy Adams.

03:13.100 --> 03:14.533
Sam Adams.

03:14.533 --> 03:15.567
Abigail--

03:15.567 --> 03:18.300
Damn, there's a lot of Adams!

03:18.300 --> 03:22.433
Now, you know how I like
to perform evil surgery.

03:22.433 --> 03:25.267
Everything
has to be just so.

03:25.267 --> 03:26.733
[saw buzzing]

03:26.733 --> 03:29.233
*

03:29.233 --> 03:32.133
Why, that sounds like
the pizzicato tiptoeing

03:32.133 --> 03:34.333
of a pesky skunk.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.733
Unacceptable!

03:36.733 --> 03:40.100
[chattering]

03:40.100 --> 03:42.067
This isn't a skunk.

03:42.067 --> 03:44.633
Some kind of hissing
novelty candle

03:44.633 --> 03:47.400
for a giant birthday cake.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.167
[loud booming]

03:50.167 --> 03:53.167
Try and catch me, bitch.

03:53.167 --> 03:56.100
[screaming]

03:58.833 --> 04:00.067
Oh, my God!

04:00.067 --> 04:03.067
[lively music]

04:03.067 --> 04:05.733
*

04:05.733 --> 04:08.567
(Cleopatra)
After we have
our perfect first kiss,

04:08.567 --> 04:10.200
I'm gonna
do things to you

04:10.200 --> 04:11.667
that would shock
the college boy

04:11.667 --> 04:13.200
I hooked up with
at cheerleading camp.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.333
Wait, what college boy?

04:14.333 --> 04:17.067
Shh, don't talk.

04:17.067 --> 04:19.467
This moment feels perfect.

04:19.467 --> 04:22.133
Kissably perfect.

04:22.133 --> 04:23.133
Dinger!

04:23.133 --> 04:24.400
[slurring]
Hey, hot lips.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.267
This letter got mixed up
in my disability checks.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.500
You know, I used to be pretty
when I was in school.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.467
Now look at me!

04:33.467 --> 04:35.200
[gasping]
Oh, my God.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.833
I applied to be a dancer

04:36.833 --> 04:40.567
on Ashley Angel from O-Town's
Spring Break Dance Academy.

04:40.567 --> 04:43.867
The Ashley Angel from O-Town?

04:43.867 --> 04:47.833
From TV's gift to pop music
and the world, O-Town?

04:47.833 --> 04:51.433
Wow, he's like the Beatles
and Jesus rolled into one.

04:51.433 --> 04:52.867
If I get in,
it'll look so great

04:52.867 --> 04:54.500
on my college application.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.567
Come on, that show
is just a porn substitute

04:56.567 --> 04:58.667
with questionable
academic value.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.500
No, no.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.733
Since Ashley Angel from O-Town
became dean of admissions,

05:03.733 --> 05:05.933
he's turned it into
a prestigious dance academy

05:05.933 --> 05:08.233
that just happens to have
the cameras running.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.667
[screams]

05:10.667 --> 05:12.300
Oh, I can't believe it!
I'm in!

05:12.300 --> 05:15.100
I'm going to study under
Ashley Angel from O-Town.

05:15.100 --> 05:19.267
But they tape that show far away
on the sunny beaches of Canada.

05:19.267 --> 05:21.300
What about us?

05:21.300 --> 05:22.367
[screams]

05:22.367 --> 05:24.733
Ashley Angel
from O-Town!

05:24.733 --> 05:26.467
Oh! Oh, it's so cold.

05:26.467 --> 05:27.467
Oh, it's so cold.

05:27.467 --> 05:28.900
I like it.

05:28.900 --> 05:33.200
Ashley Angel from O-Town, eh?

05:33.200 --> 05:37.867
* For purple
mountains' majesty *

05:37.867 --> 05:42.400
* Above the fruited plain

05:42.400 --> 05:44.767
[laughing]

05:44.767 --> 05:46.233
Fruited plain!

05:46.233 --> 05:47.633
Fruit!

05:47.633 --> 05:49.467
It has two meanings!

05:49.467 --> 05:52.400
[laughing]

05:55.067 --> 05:56.267
[coughing]

05:56.267 --> 05:57.967
JFK, man,
you got to help me.

05:57.967 --> 05:58.967
Oh, God!

05:58.967 --> 06:00.200
You're the only dude I know

06:00.200 --> 06:02.267
who has a recording studio
in his crib.

06:02.267 --> 06:04.200
What are you talking
about, bald nerd?

06:04.200 --> 06:07.067
I got to lay down a rap demo
for Ashley Angel from O-Town.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.367
Who?

06:08.367 --> 06:09.900
He's that teen idol
from that boy band.

06:09.900 --> 06:10.967
- 'NSYNC?
- No.

06:10.967 --> 06:12.067
- Backstreet Boys?
- No.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.467
- 98 Degrees?
- No.

06:13.467 --> 06:15.067
- Menudo?
- No.

06:15.067 --> 06:16.500
He's in the band O-Town.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.067
Oh, you mean
the superstar

06:18.067 --> 06:20.400
who hosts the spring break
dance academy?

06:20.400 --> 06:21.967
His connections
to the music industry

06:21.967 --> 06:23.933
will help me fulfill
my weeklong dream

06:23.933 --> 06:26.200
of becoming an international
rap sensation.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.767
No can do!

06:27.767 --> 06:30.600
I'm recording my annual
Fourth of July album

06:30.600 --> 06:33.067
and laughing at gay lyrics.

06:33.067 --> 06:34.267
Check this out!

06:34.267 --> 06:39.267
G-Spot rocks the G-spot!
G-Spot rocks the G-spot.

06:39.267 --> 06:41.633
Wow, that rhymed.

06:41.633 --> 06:45.167
Say hello to the next
Bubba Sparxxx!

06:46.633 --> 06:48.067
(woman)
This is the final
boarding announcement

06:48.067 --> 06:49.700
for flight 100 to Canada City.

06:49.700 --> 06:55.200
Cleo!

06:55.200 --> 06:56.867
[gasps]

06:56.867 --> 06:59.533
Don't get on that plane.

06:59.533 --> 07:01.800
Abe, what are you doing here?

07:01.800 --> 07:06.167
Stopping you from making
the biggest mistake of my life.

07:06.167 --> 07:09.233
Abe, if you
ask me to stay,

07:09.233 --> 07:12.467
you'll be stomping out
the fire of my dreams.

07:12.467 --> 07:16.567
The only fire I care about
is the flame of our love.

07:16.567 --> 07:18.100
And I couldn't live
if you passed

07:18.100 --> 07:20.400
that burning sensation
to another guy.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.267
Look, Abe, I'd like
nothing more

07:22.267 --> 07:24.867
than to let you feel me up
like you were my dentist,

07:24.867 --> 07:27.100
but I care too much
about our future together.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.367
Back up.
What dentist?

07:28.367 --> 07:29.733
Dr. Tucker?

07:29.733 --> 07:35.067
All that matters is you,
is us, is now.

07:35.067 --> 07:38.067
[both breathing shakily]

07:39.400 --> 07:40.833
All aboard!

07:40.833 --> 07:42.933
All aboard for Canada City!

07:44.900 --> 07:47.267
Can you at least take
the jacket I gave you?

07:47.267 --> 07:49.100
Oh, Abe, I'll
wear it on TV.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.567
I promise.

07:50.567 --> 07:53.067
It'll be our secret message.

07:53.067 --> 07:55.467
Part of you is inside of me.

07:57.167 --> 08:02.667
Cleo!

08:03.767 --> 08:05.800
Don't get on that plane...

08:05.800 --> 08:07.067
yet!

08:07.067 --> 08:08.533
First, take this demo

08:08.533 --> 08:10.467
to give to Ashley Angel
from O-Town.

08:10.467 --> 08:12.933
Ew! Get away from me.

08:14.767 --> 08:16.233
Now get on that plane!

08:16.233 --> 08:19.100
Bu--oh.

08:19.100 --> 08:21.867
Hey, man, thanks
for stalling her.

08:23.533 --> 08:26.200
Can I borrow ten bucks
for an airport cookie?

08:30.267 --> 08:31.500
*

08:31.500 --> 08:34.067
Man, I can't believe
the only way

08:34.067 --> 08:36.400
I can see my girlfriend
is on TV.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.767
[sighs]
I know how you feel, man.

08:38.767 --> 08:42.233
*

08:42.233 --> 08:44.300
Abe, be realistic.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.867
I'll bet Cleo's
already hooked up

08:45.867 --> 08:47.433
with Ashley Angel
from O-Town.

08:47.433 --> 08:48.600
Wrong-o!

08:48.600 --> 08:50.867
We made a deal
to remain faithful.

08:50.867 --> 08:53.433
No touching
below the eyebrows.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.700
[laughs]

08:54.700 --> 08:58.067
Abe, all celebrities
are completely hairless.

08:58.067 --> 08:59.567
They put the eyebrows on
in editing

08:59.567 --> 09:02.767
to make sure the actors make
the right facial expressions.

09:02.767 --> 09:05.667
We'll see who's laughing
when Cleo's wearing

09:05.667 --> 09:09.900
my letterman's jacket
on a cable TV show,

09:09.900 --> 09:12.267
which, coincidentally,
is starting right now.

09:12.267 --> 09:13.833
*

09:13.833 --> 09:15.300
(Ashley)
What's up?

09:15.300 --> 09:18.400
Welcome to sunny Canada,
where it's always spring break.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.300
It is I,
Ashley Angel from O-Town,

09:20.300 --> 09:22.233
and I command you to do dance.

09:22.233 --> 09:25.233
[girls grunting and panting]

09:25.233 --> 09:28.700
I can't believe my eyes.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.300
She's not wearing my jacket!

09:31.300 --> 09:35.833
*

09:35.833 --> 09:37.100
Hey, mate, would it be cool

09:37.100 --> 09:39.533
if I played this random demo
on live TV?

09:39.533 --> 09:42.167
Sure, teen dance shows
are all about taking chances

09:42.167 --> 09:43.633
on undiscovered
young artists.

09:43.633 --> 09:45.067
[whirring]

Aww...

09:49.533 --> 09:51.133
Oh, yeah.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.900

09:52.900 --> 09:53.933
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

09:58.967 --> 10:01.633
* G-Spot
rocks the G-spot *

10:01.633 --> 10:03.133
* What's my name? *

10:03.133 --> 10:04.167
(all)
G-Spot!

10:04.167 --> 10:05.700
(Gandhi)
* What do I rock?

10:05.700 --> 10:06.867
(all)
The G-spot!

10:06.867 --> 10:08.333
(Ghandi)
* G-Spot rocks the G-spot.

10:08.333 --> 10:11.933
So, scholar dancers,
you think this bad boy's a hit?

10:11.933 --> 10:13.033
[crowd cheering]

10:13.033 --> 10:13.967
(Gandhi)
* What's my name? *

10:13.967 --> 10:15.000
(all)
G-Spot!

10:15.000 --> 10:16.267
(Gandhi)
* What do I rock?

10:16.267 --> 10:17.300
* G-spot!

10:17.300 --> 10:19.800
* G-Spot rocks the G-spot

10:19.800 --> 10:22.167
(Cleopatra)
Abe, did you see me on TV?

10:22.167 --> 10:25.233
I saw you,
but you know what I didn't see?

10:25.233 --> 10:26.833
My letterman's jacket!

10:26.833 --> 10:28.333
And you know
where I didn't see it?

10:28.333 --> 10:29.600
On you!

10:29.600 --> 10:31.067
(Cleopatra)
What are you talking about?

10:31.067 --> 10:32.933
Of course I was wearing
your jacket.

10:32.933 --> 10:33.933
[Cleopatra laughs]

10:33.933 --> 10:34.933
Who's there with you?

10:34.933 --> 10:36.133
(Cleopatra)
Just Ashley.

10:36.133 --> 10:39.133
[laughing]
Stop tickling me. Stop!

10:39.133 --> 10:42.833
You call Professor Angel
by his first name?

10:42.833 --> 10:44.800
Hey, let me talk
to that dog.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.367
Don't worry, dog,
Cleo's in good hands.

10:46.367 --> 10:47.833
She's a real party girl.

10:47.833 --> 10:51.133
Well, don't expect her to party
with you, Professor.

10:51.133 --> 10:52.533
We have an agreement.

10:52.533 --> 10:54.633
Nothing below the eyebrows.

10:54.633 --> 10:56.300
Eyebrows?

10:56.300 --> 10:59.833
Dog, I'm an incredibly huge,
unbelievably famous celebrity.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.400
I'm completely hairless.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.833
So it's true!

11:04.100 --> 11:06.433
You've made a cuckold
out of me.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.733
Abe, wait!

11:07.733 --> 11:10.967
Send back my
letterman's jacket, Cleo.

11:10.967 --> 11:14.133
I'll need it to wipe my broken
heart off the floor...

11:14.133 --> 11:16.833
and to wear when it's chilly.

11:16.833 --> 11:19.867
My evil surgery certainly
won't be disturbed

11:19.867 --> 11:22.267
in this expensive china store.

11:22.267 --> 11:26.067
(Skunky-Poo)
Yoo-hoo!

11:26.067 --> 11:28.933
[siren blaring]

11:28.933 --> 11:30.700
[heart thumping]

11:30.700 --> 11:32.933
*

11:32.933 --> 11:36.067
Ma'am, I believe
this lipstick of dynamite

11:36.067 --> 11:37.300
belongs to you.

11:37.300 --> 11:39.067
*

11:39.067 --> 11:40.233
[loud booming]

11:40.233 --> 11:42.667
[screaming]

11:42.667 --> 11:45.233
That dynamite
really smarts!

11:45.233 --> 11:48.967
[screaming]

11:54.200 --> 11:57.100
[glass shattering]

11:58.167 --> 12:00.367
G-Spot, you claim
rhyming chose you,

12:00.367 --> 12:03.267
yet you have only one song,
which has only one rhyme,

12:03.267 --> 12:06.100
which is actually just
the same word repeated.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.567
Are you at least trying
to write another song?

12:08.567 --> 12:10.233
(Ghandi on recording)
* G-Spot rocks the G-spot

12:10.233 --> 12:11.867
[dolphin chirping]

12:11.867 --> 12:15.100
I could ask you
the same question.

12:15.100 --> 12:18.067
Are you trying
to write a hit song?

12:18.067 --> 12:19.500
I'm a reporter.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.967
(Ghandi on recording)
* G-Spot rocks the G-spot

12:20.967 --> 12:22.800
(woman)
This is the final
boarding announcement

12:22.800 --> 12:25.500
for flight 100
to Exclamation, USA.

12:25.500 --> 12:33.500
* Cleo!

12:33.500 --> 12:34.567
[gasps]

12:34.567 --> 12:36.567
Don't get on that plane.

12:36.567 --> 12:39.367
Ashley, what are you doing here?

12:39.367 --> 12:42.667
Stopping you from making
the biggest mistake of my life.

12:42.667 --> 12:44.700
I want to stay,
but I have to

12:44.700 --> 12:46.800
make things right
with my boyfriend...

12:48.700 --> 12:49.800
Abe.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.767
But you've got
so much talent, dog.

12:51.767 --> 12:54.100
I knew it the moment I felt you
grinding into my business.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.533
All aboard!

12:55.533 --> 12:58.767
All aboard
for Exclamation, USA.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.133
The girls who dance
on beach shows

13:02.133 --> 13:04.067
always achieve greatness.

13:04.067 --> 13:07.433
Look at Jenny McCarthy
and Maya Angelou.

13:07.433 --> 13:09.533
Don't you want
to be a star, dog?

13:09.533 --> 13:10.900
Of course.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.433
Everyone wants that,

13:12.433 --> 13:15.067
except ugly people who are
ashamed of the way they look.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.733
Then stay with me.

13:17.733 --> 13:20.633
We'll party on the beaches
of Canada every day,

13:20.633 --> 13:22.100
just you and me...

13:22.100 --> 13:24.200
[crowd cheering]

13:24.200 --> 13:25.500
And them.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.867
They follow me everywhere.

13:26.867 --> 13:27.867
[crowd cheering]

13:27.867 --> 13:30.367
I think my manager
pays them.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.400
[melancholy music]

13:37.400 --> 13:38.400
Surprise!

13:38.400 --> 13:39.400
[screams]

13:39.400 --> 13:40.567
You're not my science book!

13:40.567 --> 13:42.200
[metal clanging]

13:42.200 --> 13:44.267
Baby, I came back
to be with you,

13:44.267 --> 13:46.067
but you're not you.

13:46.067 --> 13:48.167
Where's the you
who gave me flowers,

13:48.167 --> 13:50.667
who massaged my thighs?

13:50.667 --> 13:52.500
Oh wait, that was
my tennis instructor.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.067
You lied, baby.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.067
You didn't wear
the letterman's jacket.

13:56.067 --> 13:57.600
Baby, I did wear it.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.933
I swear it, baby.

13:58.933 --> 14:01.633
Baby, I watched the show.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.300
I have eyes, you know.

14:03.300 --> 14:06.433
They're right under
my eyebrows!

14:06.433 --> 14:07.767
[gasps]

14:07.767 --> 14:10.633
[crying]

14:10.633 --> 14:13.467
*

14:13.467 --> 14:17.400
Everyone knows
skunks love free bacon.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.367
So when Skunky-Poo comes
to sample the treats,

14:20.367 --> 14:23.367
it won't be bacon
he'll get a taste of.

14:23.367 --> 14:25.767
Rather, it'll be
his own medicine!

14:26.867 --> 14:30.967
*

14:30.967 --> 14:32.600
[laughing and wheezing]

14:32.600 --> 14:33.867
*

14:33.867 --> 14:35.133
Ha-ha!

*

14:37.167 --> 14:38.333
[pen squeaking]

14:39.767 --> 14:42.300
Free bacon for Scudworths?

14:42.300 --> 14:44.333
Why, I'm a Scudworth.

14:48.967 --> 14:49.967
[thud]

14:49.967 --> 14:52.867
Oh, my God!
The agony!

14:52.867 --> 14:54.233
Nothing could be worse

14:54.233 --> 14:57.900
than the pain I feel
at this moment!

14:57.900 --> 14:59.667
But at least I still have

14:59.667 --> 15:02.167
this bacon to enjoy.

15:04.833 --> 15:06.133
[loud booming]

15:06.133 --> 15:09.067
[screaming]

15:12.867 --> 15:14.767
[screaming]
Why, Skunky, why?

15:14.767 --> 15:16.100
(Ghandi on recording)
* G-Spot rocks...

15:16.100 --> 15:18.067
How do you put out an album
for every holiday,

15:18.067 --> 15:20.067
and I can't even
think of another song?

15:20.067 --> 15:22.667
You just gave me a great idea!

15:22.667 --> 15:27.667
What if we take a sample
of a song that already exists,

15:27.667 --> 15:31.233
and you rap over that sample?

15:31.233 --> 15:33.067
I call it...

15:33.067 --> 15:34.933
song-taking!

15:34.933 --> 15:37.067
Uh, wouldn't that be against

15:37.067 --> 15:39.333
the rapper's code
of originality?

15:41.733 --> 15:44.733
That's not dancing.
It's filth!

15:44.733 --> 15:46.933
It's letterman-jacketless filth!

15:48.233 --> 15:50.100
And I don't condone it!

15:50.100 --> 15:52.600
Abe, you need
to forget about Cleo

15:52.600 --> 15:55.200
and find yourself
a new girl.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.133
[clears throat]

15:57.233 --> 15:58.833
You're right,
Joan of Arc.

15:58.833 --> 16:02.333
I'm gonna turn off this tape
and find another girl,

16:02.333 --> 16:04.067
possibly a redhead.

16:04.067 --> 16:06.067
Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes!

16:06.067 --> 16:07.400
Wait, what's that?

16:07.400 --> 16:08.867
VCR, pause tape.

16:08.867 --> 16:10.967
What's that
around Cleo's neck?

16:10.967 --> 16:13.867
The world's
ugliest necklace.

16:13.867 --> 16:17.600
Probably a gift
from Ashley Angel from O-Town.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.067
VCR, zoom in
on Cleo's necklace.

16:20.067 --> 16:22.433
[mechanical beeping]

16:22.433 --> 16:23.567
My jacket!

16:23.567 --> 16:25.233
Joan, she did wear it!

16:25.233 --> 16:26.767
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

16:26.767 --> 16:27.800
Lucky me!

16:27.800 --> 16:29.600
No. No, no.
It doesn't count!

16:29.600 --> 16:31.900
The arms--the arms
aren't even through the sleeves!

16:31.900 --> 16:35.467
She violated the spirit
of your agreement.

16:35.467 --> 16:37.367
Telephone, dial Cleo's number.

16:37.367 --> 16:38.367
[beeping]

16:38.367 --> 16:39.867
Yo.

16:39.867 --> 16:41.100
Is Cleo there?

16:41.100 --> 16:43.100
[slurring]
Cleo's at the airport.

16:43.100 --> 16:46.567
She's going back to be
with Ashley Angel from O-Town.

16:46.567 --> 16:50.733
But I'm here, Abe,
if you want to party.

16:50.733 --> 16:51.833
Ew.

16:51.833 --> 16:57.800
Cleo!

16:57.800 --> 16:59.067
[gasps]

16:59.067 --> 17:01.800
Don't get on that plane.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.600
[gasps]

17:03.600 --> 17:04.600
[gasps]

17:04.600 --> 17:08.067
Buddy Holly!

17:08.067 --> 17:10.133
Is there any room on your plane?

17:10.133 --> 17:11.367
Well, let me see.

17:11.367 --> 17:13.433
It's me, Ritchie Valens,
the Big Bopper,

17:13.433 --> 17:18.300
Jim Croce, Stevie Ray Vaughan,
and half of Lynyrd Skynyrd.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.767
Yeah, I guess there's room
for one more.

17:20.767 --> 17:21.967
[clattering]

17:23.067 --> 17:25.133
Oh...

17:25.133 --> 17:26.467
okay.

17:26.467 --> 17:30.067
Abe!

17:30.067 --> 17:32.067
Don't get on that plane.

17:32.067 --> 17:33.967
I can't stand
to not see you

17:33.967 --> 17:36.400
not make the biggest mistake
of one of our lives.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.400
What?

17:37.400 --> 17:39.067
Huh?
None of that matters.

17:39.067 --> 17:41.800
Cleo's flight has
a layover in Atlanta City.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.467
If we drive,
we can meet her there,

17:44.467 --> 17:46.767
and it'll save you
three days' travel time.

17:46.767 --> 17:47.767
[exasperated sigh]

17:47.767 --> 17:49.100
And about $90.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.200
Done.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.300
Thanks, pal.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.767
Let's roll!

17:52.767 --> 17:57.367
Scudworth!

17:57.367 --> 17:59.233
Don't get on that plane!

18:03.100 --> 18:11.300
Cleo!

18:11.300 --> 18:12.433
[gasps]

18:12.433 --> 18:15.133
Don't get on that plane!

18:15.133 --> 18:18.067
I saw the necklace, Cleo.
I saw it!

18:18.067 --> 18:19.300
Oh, Abe.

18:19.300 --> 18:21.433
I wore the jacket
in Ashley's hot tub,

18:21.433 --> 18:22.433
and it shrank.

18:22.433 --> 18:24.967
Ashley's hot tub?

18:24.967 --> 18:27.067
All that doesn't matter, baby.

18:27.067 --> 18:28.667
Just come home with me.

18:28.667 --> 18:30.500
We'll start a new life together.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.800
Abe, I want that
more than anything.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.767
But, you see, when I'm 25
and looking back on my life,

18:35.767 --> 18:39.700
I don't want to regret
not getting on this plane.

18:39.700 --> 18:41.733
[whispering]
You were the one.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.800
[melancholy music]

18:48.800 --> 18:53.800
*

18:53.800 --> 19:00.367

* I, I don't wanna forget *

19:00.367 --> 19:05.067
* How we got this far

19:05.067 --> 19:06.433
[screams]

19:06.433 --> 19:07.600
Cleo!

19:07.600 --> 19:09.900
But I--
how did you--

19:09.900 --> 19:12.500
Love works
in mysterious ways.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.500
But you were just--

19:13.500 --> 19:15.733
Shh.

19:15.733 --> 19:19.833
(man)
* I close my eyes
and drift away *

19:19.833 --> 19:22.800
[fireworks popping and hissing]

19:22.800 --> 19:24.467
Thanks, Joan.

19:24.467 --> 19:27.467
I'm kissing my girlfriend
because of you.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.733
*

19:28.733 --> 19:31.167
Dinger.

19:31.167 --> 19:33.567
Yo, cabana boy!

19:33.567 --> 19:37.400
Bring me a hot dog
with a side of catsup!

19:37.400 --> 19:40.200
*

19:40.200 --> 19:43.900
This catsup will really
spice up my dog.

19:43.900 --> 19:45.167
*

19:45.167 --> 19:46.567
Darn it.

19:46.567 --> 19:50.933
It seems to be blocked
by some sort of lit fuse.

It is I,
Ashley Angel from O-Town.

20:07.667 --> 20:10.633
Anyway, I'm here
with a brand-new video.

It's G-Spot's follow-up,
"UR A G Old Flag."

20:14.667 --> 20:16.133

you're a high-flying flag *

20:22.233 --> 20:23.733
Flag.

20:23.733 --> 20:25.467
(JFK)
* And forever in peace
may you wave *

20:25.467 --> 20:27.100
Wave, ya'll.

(JFK)
* You're the emblem
of the land I love *

20:30.133 --> 20:31.567
Emblem.

20:31.567 --> 20:33.467

and the brave *

20:33.467 --> 20:35.200

20:35.200 --> 20:38.100
(JFK)
* Every heart beats true
for the red, white, and blue *

20:38.100 --> 20:39.700
One time,
two time.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.400
(JFK)
* Where there's never
a boast or brag *

20:42.400 --> 20:43.900
Do the Bartman.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.533
(JFK)
* Should auld acquaintance
be forgot *

20:46.533 --> 20:48.067
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

20:48.067 --> 20:50.433
(JFK)
* Keep your, uh, eye
on the grand old flag *

employees *

21:09.233 --> 21:11.967
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

21:11.967 --> 21:14.967
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

21:14.967 --> 21:17.867
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

21:17.867 --> 21:20.833
* They're gonna make
it if they try *

21:20.833 --> 21:23.700
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

21:23.700 --> 21:29.867
