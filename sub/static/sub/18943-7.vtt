00:06.679 --> 00:08.758
Ann Widdecombe or Thora Hird?

00:08.759 --> 00:12.889
No contest. Thora Hird.
She's got that great automatic bed.

00:13.319 --> 00:16.160
(Brian) Anne Widdecombe
or Mother Theresa?

00:16.160 --> 00:18.038
What's he staring at?

00:18.039 --> 00:22.239
He's probably trying to work out
whether you're Bill or Ben.

00:22.279 --> 00:25.799
- He won't beat you up.
- (JP) At least you're his own size.

00:25.799 --> 00:29.160
- Kids always stare at me.
- They sense you're a teacher.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.479
They can't believe you're a teacher.

00:31.479 --> 00:34.280
(Jenny) It's like this having tits
when you're around.

00:34.280 --> 00:37.760
- What are you doing?
- (JP) People can still see you.

00:37.760 --> 00:40.960
- Kids shouldn't be allowed in pubs.
- He's not harming you.

00:40.960 --> 00:44.880
He keeps staring.
He's making me feel like I look weird.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.759
He's turned you into
a retarded Marcel Marceau.

00:48.759 --> 00:51.440
He's lowered the level of conversation.

00:51.440 --> 00:55.780
I'd say peekaboo and working out
the ugliest person you'd shag

00:55.800 --> 00:57.679
are pretty much on the same level.

00:57.679 --> 01:00.399
I hate to say it but I agree with Kurt.

01:00.399 --> 01:04.680
- Pub's not the place for kids.
- But where do you draw the line?

01:04.680 --> 01:07.479
So long as they stump up
when it's their round.

01:07.479 --> 01:11.200
- We were all children once.
- (Brian) But you like kids.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.360
I like teaching them. That's different.
I don't want them wherever I go.

01:15.360 --> 01:18.000
You need to be able
to get away from them sometimes.

Good morning. As you know,
this morning, year 9 tutor groups

02:53.160 --> 02:56.240
are going to be
talking about contraception.

02:57.919 --> 03:02.039
After speaking with Beverley Jarvis
I've decided that year 11 groups

03:02.039 --> 03:04.758
should go over the subject again too.

03:04.759 --> 03:07.560
Beverley feels that
she was underinformed

03:07.560 --> 03:10.038
about the risks of pregnancy.

03:10.039 --> 03:12.679
I've persuaded her
to give a lunch-time talk

03:12.679 --> 03:14.599
about her own experiences

03:14.600 --> 03:19.080
which I'd like all year 1 1s to attend,
along with their tutors.

03:24.159 --> 03:28.079
It might be OK. They've had
two extra years to find the clitoris.

03:28.079 --> 03:30.739
They're all at it like rabbits anyhow.

03:31.119 --> 03:34.360
Maybe they should take it in turns
to teach the class.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.960
If anything would make you
use contraception,

03:36.960 --> 03:38.758
it's a roomful of kids.

03:38.759 --> 03:41.759
You should be so lucky.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.720
Sorry. They've run out of baby carrots.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.960
(Liz) What are you doing?
You're not getting one.

03:57.960 --> 04:00.960
Year 7s aren't doing contraception.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.240
If I hear from Kayla that
you've mentioned anything

04:05.240 --> 04:07.039
that goes on below the waist,

04:07.039 --> 04:10.039
I'll be down on you like a ton of bricks.

04:13.479 --> 04:16.839
And... that's about
the size of it, so to speak.

04:17.880 --> 04:22.599
So if none of you have any questions,
we'll move on to something more...

04:22.599 --> 04:24.319
Yes.

04:24.320 --> 04:27.199
Why can't men sometimes get erections?

04:27.200 --> 04:30.200
Erm... sorry, I... can't help you there.

04:33.399 --> 04:36.399
(Laughter and cheering next door)

04:39.959 --> 04:44.039
You forgot one. The best way not
to get pregnant is not to have sex.

04:44.039 --> 04:46.239
I'm surprised you missed that one out.

04:46.239 --> 04:50.649
But for that to work,
it helps if you're really short and ugly.

04:54.360 --> 04:57.360
The sheep was introduced
to New Zealand...

04:59.040 --> 05:02.040
- by the Europeans.
- What, that one?

05:03.559 --> 05:06.319
No. Obviously not this one.

05:06.320 --> 05:09.119
Anyway, they introduced
quite a few of them.

05:09.119 --> 05:13.109
And they reproduced and now
there are 14 million of them.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.640
(Kayla) How did they reproduce?

05:17.519 --> 05:20.739
Well... in the same way
all animals reproduce.

05:25.799 --> 05:29.159
You know, a... a man sheep
meets a lady sheep...

05:32.279 --> 05:34.399
and they fall in love.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.400
Sex is crap if you're wearing a condom.

05:38.440 --> 05:41.119
That's not true if you're doing it right.

05:41.119 --> 05:45.109
And can anyone tell me the risks
of not wearing a condom?

05:47.679 --> 05:52.089
- AIDS, venereal disease, pregnancy.
- Not enjoying it so much.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.840
You say that but you also
wouldn't enjoy it so much

05:55.840 --> 05:58.840
if you had genital warts.

06:03.760 --> 06:07.679
My class don't know the difference
between a coil and a Slinky.

06:07.679 --> 06:10.679
They didn't take in a word of what I said.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.238
Nor mine.

06:16.239 --> 06:18.999
(Simon) They might have
found it a bit confusing.

06:18.999 --> 06:21.639
Perhaps we've done the world a favour

06:21.640 --> 06:24.799
by educating a generation
to have sex with vegetables.

06:24.799 --> 06:27.799
Kurt, what are you doing?

06:27.959 --> 06:29.399
Oh, you are disgusting!

06:29.399 --> 06:31.958
I wasn't looking at Bev!

06:31.959 --> 06:35.809
- I was just...
- (Brian) Well, I think it's beautiful.

06:36.719 --> 06:39.599
It's what women were designed for.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.719
- It's a natural bodily function.
- So shouldn't she do it in the toilets?

06:43.719 --> 06:47.219
No. This is the canteen.
This is where people eat.

06:48.119 --> 06:51.239
- We'd better not be late.
- Can't we just skip it?

06:51.239 --> 06:55.319
Seeing that's put me off having kids
for life. And white coffee.

06:55.319 --> 06:56.760
(Baby screams)

06:56.760 --> 07:02.679
You start to swell up like some giant boil,
veins start appearing all over your body.

07:02.679 --> 07:05.679
You get all hairy.

07:06.519 --> 07:10.369
You have to start wearing
floral tents from Mothercare.

07:10.999 --> 07:13.878
(Baby screams)

07:13.879 --> 07:19.059
And then milk begins dripping out of you
and you smell like rotten cheese.

07:20.680 --> 07:23.680
Then you have to give birth to it.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.839
Get away from there. You're too young.

07:26.839 --> 07:28.719
(Bev) ..right down the middle.

07:28.719 --> 07:31.880
Then you think you're going
to shit yourself, and you do.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.318
But you've still got hours to go.

07:34.319 --> 07:36.600
And if you can't get it out yourself

07:36.600 --> 07:40.399
then they cut you open
and stitch you back together again.

07:40.399 --> 07:43.399
If you don't tear open, that is.

07:43.720 --> 07:46.560
After that you feel like
every time you sneeze

07:46.560 --> 07:49.279
your insides are going to drop out.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.199
But the worst thing is

07:52.200 --> 07:55.910
you've got a baby
that you've got to look after 24/7.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.678
Your life is over.

07:58.679 --> 08:02.529
So if you want to have sex
more than once in your life,

08:02.639 --> 08:05.639
use contraception.

08:14.999 --> 08:17.999
- Thank you.
- (Bell)

08:21.639 --> 08:24.879
Now I know why men
sometimes can't get erections.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.999
It's put me off sex for days.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.640
No, it's put you off being
sexually frustrated for days.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.840
What's your problem?
You'll never have to give birth.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.840
What happened to you?
Are you all right?

08:40.760 --> 08:42.639
(Bev) Miss?

08:42.640 --> 08:45.640
Miss? Can I have my baby back?

08:47.319 --> 08:48.929
Yeah. Of course. Sorry.

08:54.520 --> 08:57.520
- She's lovely.
- He's lovely.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.438
Yeah, he is, isn't he?

09:01.439 --> 09:03.760
I didn't really mean all that stuff I said.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.639
What stuff?

09:06.640 --> 09:09.598
- Caesarean or natural birth?
- Caesarean.

09:09.599 --> 09:12.640
They cut you open,
they drop instruments inside you.

09:12.640 --> 09:15.039
You'll be searched in airports forever.

09:15.039 --> 09:17.159
- I don't care.
- Susan?

09:17.160 --> 09:19.959
Caesarean or natural childbirth?

09:19.960 --> 09:22.478
- I don't mind.
- No, it's a game.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.479
- What is?
- What's the matter with you?

09:26.560 --> 09:29.560
I want to have a baby.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.160
What? Can't you get the drinks in first?

09:34.399 --> 09:37.479
- Christ, what brought this on?
- I don't know.

09:37.479 --> 09:41.679
One minute I wanted to rap the baby's
head on a chair to stop it crying,

09:41.679 --> 09:44.679
and the next I fell in love with it.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.839
Didn't you see his tiny little hands?

09:47.840 --> 09:50.799
Were those the tiny things
on the end of its tiny arms?

09:50.799 --> 09:53.799
All I know is that holding Bev's baby

09:54.080 --> 09:56.879
made me realise
that I want to have one too.

09:56.879 --> 09:58.599
I think it's a great idea.

09:58.599 --> 10:01.559
(Kurt) I thought you needed
to escape from kids.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.639
If you have your own you never will.

10:03.639 --> 10:06.789
They're worse than pot plants.
You'll go mad.

10:06.799 --> 10:10.480
No, I won't. Even if your kids
turn out to be Tory politicians

10:10.480 --> 10:13.438
you still like them, it's a fact of life,

10:13.439 --> 10:15.879
like being embarrassed by your dad.

10:15.879 --> 10:20.149
But you've still got to find a man first.
And that'll take...

10:22.239 --> 10:24.519
God knows how long that'll take.

10:24.520 --> 10:28.790
I don't need a man. All I need
is the right genetic material.

10:29.479 --> 10:31.360
You're too young to have a baby.

10:31.360 --> 10:34.720
You heard Bev.
Have a baby and your life's over.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.960
You'll never be able to... I don't know...

10:38.080 --> 10:41.078
- bungee jump.
- I don't care.

10:41.079 --> 10:44.919
Fucking hell. I never thought
I'd hear myself say this but...

10:44.919 --> 10:47.078

No, I haven't worked things
through that far yet.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.950
I'm struggling with
the idea of being its mother.

14:03.439 --> 14:06.939
- Have you copied those notes?
- I've just got in.

14:07.160 --> 14:09.599
I did ask for them on Friday.

14:09.600 --> 14:13.039
But if you get them to me
by this afternoon that'll be fine.

14:13.039 --> 14:16.960
If teaching doesn't work out,
she could get a job at Prontaprint.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.999
- I thought you didn't care what she did.
- I don't.

14:19.999 --> 14:23.149
As long as she doesn't break
the photocopier.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.320
Well, it looks like your worries are over.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.960
You don't just want a baby to have
someone to photocopy for you?

14:29.960 --> 14:33.479
You could lure Carol away from Penny
with a few dog chews.

14:33.479 --> 14:35.520
Too late. Classic case of imprinting.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.640
Penny was the first person Carol saw
after Kurt dumped her.

14:38.640 --> 14:41.519
There's no breaking that bond.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.400
If Penny were to drop dead,

14:43.400 --> 14:47.639
Mutley there would spend her life
growling on her gravestone.

14:47.639 --> 14:50.639
(Bell)

14:52.640 --> 14:55.359
- Susan, can I have a word?
- Can it wait?

14:55.359 --> 14:56.959
No.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.838
OK. Well, go on, then.

14:58.839 --> 15:01.839
I'd like to be the father.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.840
We wouldn't have to sleep together
or anything.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.799
Well, if you wanted to, we could.

15:07.799 --> 15:10.799
Or I could just... you know.

15:11.079 --> 15:14.000
- And I wouldn't want any rights.
- Brian...

15:14.000 --> 15:17.240
I'd just like to play football
with him sometimes

15:17.240 --> 15:19.759
- and take him to home games.
- Brian.

15:19.759 --> 15:23.959
I'm very flattered, of course,
but it's not going to happen.

15:24.599 --> 15:27.599
Not in a million years. I'm sorry.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Can I ask you something?

15:40.839 --> 15:43.079
- I warned you.
- What?

15:43.080 --> 15:45.319
- Not to go there.
- Go where?

15:45.320 --> 15:47.839
- Below the waist.
- I didn't.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.318
That's not what Kayla says.

15:50.319 --> 15:53.880
I talked about the breeding of livestock.
It's in the syllabus.

15:53.880 --> 15:57.479
It says in the syllabus that
sheep only decide to have lambs

15:57.479 --> 16:00.600
once they're in a tender,
loving relationship?

16:00.600 --> 16:03.750
- No. I just thought...
- What did you think?

16:03.799 --> 16:05.919
That the boy sheep
had to ask permission

16:05.919 --> 16:07.400
to marry the girl sheep?

16:07.400 --> 16:10.400
- No, I...
- They get married in white.

16:11.039 --> 16:15.589
And then they go on honeymoon
to an exotic corner of their field.

16:30.439 --> 16:32.438
All right?

16:32.439 --> 16:35.799
Please, don't you offer
to father my child, too.

16:35.919 --> 16:38.519
What are you talking about?

16:38.520 --> 16:41.520
You didn't, did you?

16:41.760 --> 16:44.880
Not you as well!
What happened to being too young?

16:44.880 --> 16:47.158
About bungee jumping?

16:47.159 --> 16:49.160
You were the one who brought that up.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.838
Anyhow, I've done bungee jumping.

16:51.839 --> 16:54.559
Only lasts a few seconds
then you feel sick.

16:54.559 --> 16:57.559
What does that remind me of?

16:57.919 --> 17:01.040
- I think I'd be a good dad.
- I think you would, too.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.318
Thanks.

17:03.319 --> 17:05.679
Well, you can all forget about it.

17:05.679 --> 17:09.878
I wouldn't dip my toe
into this school's stagnant gene pool.

17:10.839 --> 17:14.550
There are three billion men
out there to choose from,

17:14.759 --> 17:18.819
and any one of them
would be preferable to one of you lot.

17:19.040 --> 17:22.239
Whoever you choose,
you want to give them a thorough check.

17:22.239 --> 17:26.019
Ginger people dye their hair
to lure the unsuspecting.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.399
You want to find a man with small hips.

17:29.399 --> 17:30.958
And big breasts.

17:30.959 --> 17:33.480
What a pity you've ruled
everyone here out.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.480
- Bob's your dream man.
- No, not Bob.

17:37.240 --> 17:40.240
He's a Cancer.

17:43.839 --> 17:46.839
The star sign.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.599
You should find one of those men

17:53.599 --> 17:53.600
who's genetically incapable
of growing facial hair.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.919
- Clare wants to see you two.
- What about?

17:59.919 --> 18:02.480
- How should I know?
- You know everything.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.240
But the only fun thing
about knowing everything

18:05.240 --> 18:08.670
is scaring the people
that don't know everything.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.960
Ask God.

18:13.679 --> 18:17.000
(Jenny) If you could have any of those,
which would you have?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.038
How about Lee?

18:19.039 --> 18:21.679
- Haven't you seen Alien?
- Wayne?

18:21.680 --> 18:24.560
I'd have to sleep
with Quasimodo, wouldn't I?

18:24.560 --> 18:27.078
Ed Smith's a nice boy.

18:27.079 --> 18:30.319
You must remember his dad.
He used to teach biology.

18:30.319 --> 18:33.279
- The Paul Newman lookalike?
- He was clever, too.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.638
So what are you saying?

18:35.639 --> 18:38.159
Who should I take my egg cup along to?

18:38.159 --> 18:40.879
The 65-year-old or the 14-year-old?

18:40.880 --> 18:44.380
Ed's older brother
is joining the school tomorrow.

18:44.840 --> 18:48.240
Thank you for your concern
but I'm not that desperate.

18:48.240 --> 18:51.880
I don't have to resort
to seducing schoolchildren yet.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.319
No?

18:54.320 --> 18:57.199
(Liz) He's coming to work here.

18:57.200 --> 19:00.200
He's 25. His name is Errol.

19:00.279 --> 19:03.279
(Buzzer)

19:05.319 --> 19:08.539
I've had a letter
from Josh Atkinson's mother.

19:08.760 --> 19:11.919
She's worried about
her son's academic progress.

19:11.919 --> 19:14.879
- What progress?
- That's her point.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.880
I'm sorry but he's impossible to teach.

19:18.079 --> 19:20.199
- Jenny?
- I agree with Susan.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.200
He's a disruptive influence.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.000
Have you got any suggestions

19:26.000 --> 19:29.360
about how we could bring him
more into the fold?

19:33.000 --> 19:37.319
I'll try and stall his mother
with a copy of the new school brochure.

19:37.319 --> 19:40.319
In the meantime,

19:40.439 --> 19:43.279
try and think of something we can do
to sort him out.

19:43.279 --> 19:46.279
(Buzzer)

19:51.519 --> 19:55.639
- How about Ritalin?
- Yeah. A couple of bottles should do it.

19:55.639 --> 19:58.079
Still, it's a blow to the genes theory.

19:58.079 --> 20:00.039
Josh Atkinson's mother can write.

20:00.039 --> 20:03.000
She probably got her parole officer
to write it.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.879
You know JP is a Pisces, don't you?

20:05.880 --> 20:10.159
You're a Taurus. A Taurus and a Pisces
make the perfect parents.

20:10.159 --> 20:13.039
And JP's gay, too.
Gay men make the best dads

20:13.039 --> 20:15.080
but they can't have kids of their own.

20:15.080 --> 20:18.120
Not even if one's a Taurus
and the other one's a Libra?

20:18.120 --> 20:20.278
Plus, JP's a really nice guy,

20:20.279 --> 20:22.919
which may make the baby less sarcastic.

20:22.919 --> 20:26.069
All right, Claire Short
and the Queen Mother.

20:27.079 --> 20:30.079
Ah, now you're asking.

20:30.279 --> 20:32.359
I've got an even better one.

20:32.360 --> 20:35.360
Ian Paisley or Michael Jackson?

20:36.599 --> 20:39.038
- Well?
- Well?

20:39.039 --> 20:41.960
- We're blokes. We wouldn't...
- (Simon) Eugh.

20:41.960 --> 20:45.120
I just closed my eyes
and saw Ian Paisley and Claire Short

20:45.120 --> 20:48.079
shagging in the House of Commons.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.160
Oh, Jesus.
I got Bob and Liz in the toilets.

20:51.399 --> 20:53.760
- Oh, please.
- Imagine if they had a kid.

20:53.760 --> 20:58.519
- It'd want to be breastfed by Penny.
- Can you breastfeed with false tits?

20:58.519 --> 20:59.959
It just tastes like UHT.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.479
It'd be too busy winding
people up to eat.

21:02.479 --> 21:05.479
Did anyone invite Penny to the pub?

21:05.959 --> 21:09.599
- Thank fuck for that.
- I've got an even worse one.

21:10.799 --> 21:13.799
Imagine Kurt and Carol having a kid?

21:14.639 --> 21:16.879
Had anyone ever seen Eraserhead?

21:16.880 --> 21:19.880
I need a drink.

21:20.840 --> 21:23.278
Anyone else want one?

21:23.279 --> 21:26.279
- Oh!
- I'll go halves with you.

21:28.319 --> 21:31.319
- I had a dream about you last night.
- Really?

21:31.319 --> 21:35.239
- Sure it wasn't a nightmare?
- My baby looked like you.

21:35.399 --> 21:37.638
(JP) It was a nightmare!

21:37.639 --> 21:39.479
Really?

21:39.480 --> 21:42.480
- So what did she say to you?
- What?

21:42.639 --> 21:45.278
- Susan, when you offered to...
- Oh.

21:45.279 --> 21:48.279
Er... not if I was the last man on earth.

21:51.559 --> 21:55.199
- What did she say to you?
- Not in a million years.

21:56.279 --> 21:59.429
What? You think
she's just stalling for time?

22:01.359 --> 22:02.959
You're so deluded!

22:02.960 --> 22:05.239
With "not if you were
the last man on earth"

22:05.239 --> 22:07.639
there's a chance
of sex on another planet.

22:07.639 --> 22:10.639
(♪ The Daisycutters: Kiss Me Stupid)

22:23.079 --> 22:26.079
Oh, for fuck's sake!

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
Get a move on!

22:31.839 --> 22:34.839
I don't believe it.

22:35.079 --> 22:38.079
Really... Fuck!

22:42.479 --> 22:45.479
Get in!

22:52.039 --> 22:55.039
(Siren)

23:13.039 --> 23:16.039
Hey!

23:24.279 --> 23:27.319
Listen, I've been thinking
about your dream.

23:27.319 --> 23:30.319
- Yes?
- If you want to, I'll do it.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.720
You know, I'll be the father of your child.

23:32.720 --> 23:35.720
Having a kid might help me
get things in perspective

23:35.720 --> 23:39.080
and if, when I do that,
I find I don't want one,

23:39.200 --> 23:41.679
then I've done you a favour anyhow.

23:41.680 --> 23:44.680
Well, today's the day.

23:46.399 --> 23:49.399
Paul Newman Junior day.

23:50.839 --> 23:54.440
This is the morning when the bloke
who is going to shag you

23:54.440 --> 23:57.800
and father your child
is arriving at the school.

23:57.920 --> 23:59.638
(Clapping)

23:59.639 --> 24:03.559
Morning, everyone.
Just a couple of things this morning.

24:03.599 --> 24:05.639
Firstly, I'd like to remind you all

24:05.639 --> 24:08.600
that trees on the school grounds
are out of bounds.

24:08.600 --> 24:12.199
The school insurance policy
only covers injuries to children

24:12.199 --> 24:15.199
caused by trees falling on top of them.

24:15.839 --> 24:18.480
Secondly, I'd like
to take this opportunity

24:18.480 --> 24:22.400
to introduce you to
our new lab technician, Errol Smith.

24:22.839 --> 24:25.839
(Polite applause)

24:35.039 --> 24:38.399
- You knew, didn't you?
- I know everything, me.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
♪ The look of love

24:46.319 --> 24:49.319
♪ Is in your eyes

24:51.279 --> 24:53.278
♪ The look

24:53.279 --> 24:56.279
♪ Your heart can't disguise... ♪

25:02.120 --> 25:05.359
(Jenny) Maybe if he took
his glasses off he'd be beautiful.

25:05.359 --> 25:09.279
(Susan) Looks like doctor's orders.
He needs them to keep his eyes in.

25:09.279 --> 25:12.280
(Brian) How can a Paul Newman
lookalike have him as a son?

25:12.280 --> 25:15.239
(JP) Are you sure it wasn't
Gary Numan he looked like?

25:15.239 --> 25:18.520
(Jenny) Fuck. It goes to show,
you can't rely on genes.

25:18.520 --> 25:22.880
Someone could be good-looking
and still have children that look like Kurt.

25:22.880 --> 25:26.399
Someone could be intelligent
and have children like Brian.

25:26.399 --> 25:28.840
- (Brian) What?
- (JP) She's got a point.

25:28.840 --> 25:32.479
There are so many ginger people
and ginger people never get laid.

25:32.479 --> 25:34.639
(Kurt) Someone who's a nun

25:34.640 --> 25:37.720
could still have kids
who are nymphomaniacs.

25:37.800 --> 25:40.800
- So it's just luck?
- To start off with.

25:41.080 --> 25:44.040
But how someone is brought up
is the important thing.

25:44.040 --> 25:46.318
Even if they're ginger.

25:46.319 --> 25:49.319
What is it with you and ginger people?

25:49.519 --> 25:52.519
I used to share a bathroom with one.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.600
They moult.

25:54.600 --> 25:57.600
(Bell)

26:03.319 --> 26:06.319
So what do you think about my offer?

26:06.520 --> 26:09.359
I didn't want to say any more
in front of anyone.

26:09.359 --> 26:13.279
What makes you think I would want you
to be the father of any kid of mine?

26:13.279 --> 26:15.199
Well, your dream.

26:15.200 --> 26:18.519
I dreamt I had a baby
that looked exactly like you.

26:18.519 --> 26:20.719
So that means
you want to have my baby.

26:20.719 --> 26:24.919
Or maybe, just maybe,
it means I think of you as a big baby.

26:25.320 --> 26:28.278
Oh. So I'll take that as a no, then.

26:28.279 --> 26:31.279
Take that as a never.

26:31.399 --> 26:34.559
It wouldn't work out
if the father was from the school.

26:34.559 --> 26:37.439
If we were friends
it'd mess the friendship up

26:37.439 --> 26:41.280
and if we weren't then I'd have to try
and be friends with them,

26:41.280 --> 26:44.780
so why weren't they my friends
in the first place?

26:45.120 --> 26:47.519
Anyhow, it doesn't matter
who the father is.

26:47.519 --> 26:50.119
The important thing
is how the baby's brought up.

26:50.119 --> 26:53.759
How it's nurtured.
And that would all be down to me.

26:57.159 --> 27:01.399
A few of you might have got hold
of the wrong end of the stick

27:01.399 --> 27:04.238
after the other day's lesson.

27:04.239 --> 27:07.239
Sheep don't really fall in love.

27:08.040 --> 27:11.040
No. Normally with sheep,

27:11.280 --> 27:14.570
one ram is used
to inseminate hundreds of ewes.

27:16.200 --> 27:19.840
There's no time to develop
any kind of relationship.

27:20.279 --> 27:23.279
He just gets in there and goes for it.

27:25.119 --> 27:28.119
Josh, can I have a quick word?

27:28.520 --> 27:31.199
I'm already booked up
for detentions this term.

27:31.199 --> 27:33.559
I'm not going to give you a detention.

27:33.559 --> 27:36.559
(Bob) Miss Neville. Miss Neville!

27:37.040 --> 27:39.959
Can we have a word in private?

27:39.960 --> 27:42.439
Penny!

27:42.440 --> 27:45.440
- Bob, hi!
- I can't read these.

27:45.800 --> 27:49.520
I'm sorry, would you like me
to enlarge them to A3 for you?

27:49.520 --> 27:51.999
No, they're too faint. Look at them.

27:51.999 --> 27:55.989
If you can't read them
I'll photocopy them again for you.

27:59.759 --> 28:01.399
Carol?

28:01.400 --> 28:04.120
Josh, I really want to try and help you

28:04.120 --> 28:07.620
but you seem to have
some sort of problem with me.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.118
Is everything all right at home?

28:11.119 --> 28:13.998
Well, the TV's on the blink.

28:13.999 --> 28:17.400
I meant more are you having
problems with your parents?

28:17.400 --> 28:20.830
No. My mum's an alcoholic
and my dad's in prison.

28:22.199 --> 28:25.979
I hardly ever see either of them,
which is fine by me.

28:26.359 --> 28:29.799
I'm sorry. That must make
your home life very difficult.

28:29.799 --> 28:32.799
Yeah. It is difficult.

28:33.480 --> 28:36.480
But it's better than school.

28:41.279 --> 28:43.640
Have you been encouraging casual sex?

28:43.640 --> 28:45.719
What? No!

28:45.720 --> 28:49.080
What's this, "Wham, bam,
thank you, ram" supposed to mean?

28:49.080 --> 28:52.860
Keep your sordid stories
of animal orgies to yourself.

28:55.239 --> 28:58.440
A nun couldn't really have children
who were nymphomaniacs.

28:58.440 --> 29:00.279
What?

29:00.280 --> 29:03.720
Well, nuns don't have sex
so they can't have children.

29:03.720 --> 29:07.239
And if a nun did have sex,
well, as nuns never have sex,

29:07.239 --> 29:10.079
she'd be a nymphomaniac anyhow
in nun terms

29:10.079 --> 29:13.079
so it'd be what you'd expect.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.119
Sometimes I really wish I smoked.

29:17.119 --> 29:19.039
Why?

29:19.040 --> 29:23.079
Then I could have a cigarette.
Liz is really winding me up.

29:23.079 --> 29:25.600
Kayla's bad enough,
but the two of them...

29:25.600 --> 29:28.038
If you were brought up by Liz

29:28.039 --> 29:31.359
you'd have to be a wind-up merchant
just to survive.

29:31.359 --> 29:34.640
It's a craft. Been passed on
from generation to generation.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.080
So you go along with
this upbringing thing?

29:37.080 --> 29:39.399
Don't tell me.

29:39.400 --> 29:43.040
You were brought up
by the authors of the Kamasutra.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.599
What?

29:51.600 --> 29:56.290
If it's all in the upbringing,
it doesn't matter who the father is.

29:56.800 --> 29:59.800
Could be anyone.

30:27.439 --> 30:29.079
(Simon) OK, Clare.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.480
I wouldn't like to have been
brought up by her.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.720
She probably files her kids away at night.

30:33.720 --> 30:36.440
I wonder if she's got a come-in buzzer
outside her loo?

30:36.440 --> 30:39.440
I wonder if she's got one
on her knickers?

30:39.480 --> 30:42.319
- What if Bob was your dad?
- That's not funny.

30:42.319 --> 30:45.319
Bob's got children.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.639
Oh, no, not again.

30:49.640 --> 30:53.079
She said it was how the kid
was brought up that was important.

30:53.079 --> 30:55.239
- You did say that.
- I also said

30:55.239 --> 30:59.840
I was never ever going to sleep
with anyone here about a million times.

30:59.840 --> 31:01.799
Well, anyhow,

31:01.800 --> 31:04.920
I'm not sure I agree
with this upbringing thing.

31:04.920 --> 31:08.600
How do you know rat boy
isn't horrible as well as ugly?

31:08.600 --> 31:10.879
(Susan) I haven't spoken to him yet.

31:10.879 --> 31:14.999
But his father is nice so I assume
he brought him up to be nice.

31:14.999 --> 31:17.640
- I don't like the look of him.
- That's my point.

31:17.640 --> 31:21.159
- You can't judge by appearances.
- We've got nothing else to go on.

31:21.159 --> 31:24.000
If he's so great,
why don't you go and talk to him?

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
OK. I will.

31:33.999 --> 31:36.680
- Maybe later.
- That might be too late.

31:36.680 --> 31:39.680
Carol might have eaten him by then.

31:41.760 --> 31:45.600
I was wondering if you could do these
again for me, please?

31:45.600 --> 31:48.238
Erm...

31:48.239 --> 31:50.638
- What?
- Ahem...

31:50.639 --> 31:53.800
- (Quietly) This afternoon.
- You'll have to speak up.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.950
(Squeakily)
She's really busy this afternoon.

32:05.199 --> 32:08.199
So what did she say to you?

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
"Fuck off and die."

32:15.199 --> 32:18.279
"I'd rather have my eyes
eaten out by rats."

32:18.759 --> 32:22.329
Penny thinks you and I
should have a baby together.

32:22.600 --> 32:25.039
Don't worry. That wasn't a proposition.

32:25.039 --> 32:28.479
Although our star signs
are ideally suited and you are gay

32:28.479 --> 32:31.919
and gay men apparently can't have
children on their own.

32:31.919 --> 32:35.199
Why do people assume
that gay people love children?

32:35.199 --> 32:37.039
You might have become gay

32:37.040 --> 32:40.439
because you hated children
and wouldn't want any.

32:40.439 --> 32:42.600
Wow. There goes Freudian analysis.

32:42.600 --> 32:45.680
I like children.
Of course... What the fuck?

32:45.720 --> 32:48.078
You little... shit.

32:48.079 --> 32:51.079
You were saying about liking children?

32:51.359 --> 32:53.079
Well...

32:53.080 --> 32:56.440
Should feel sorry for him.
He doesn't have much of a life.

32:56.440 --> 32:59.039
His mum's a drunk
and his dad's in prison.

32:59.039 --> 33:03.309
With his upbringing
we might all turn out to be little shits.

33:06.040 --> 33:08.800
Think she's made a mistake?
She's blind as a bat.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.119
Maybe she thinks it's Penny with piles.

33:11.119 --> 33:15.109
No way. She relies almost
entirely on her sense of smell.

33:15.359 --> 33:18.359
Imprinting is supposed to be for life

33:18.440 --> 33:21.199
unless the object
of your affection rejects you.

33:21.199 --> 33:24.209
Penny hates photocopying
too much for that.

33:26.159 --> 33:29.159
- It's a miracle.
- (Screaming)

33:32.400 --> 33:34.359
Baa.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.478
- Did you hear that?
- What?

33:36.479 --> 33:38.639
She baa-ed at me.

33:38.640 --> 33:42.639
Maybe it's time you gave sheep farming
in New Zealand a rest.

33:42.639 --> 33:46.319
There he is. Now's your chance
to make up for his upbringing.

33:46.319 --> 33:49.319
Josh? Josh. I meant what I said.

33:50.399 --> 33:53.720
If you want to talk to someone
you can always talk to me.

33:53.720 --> 33:55.640
Or if you'd prefer to talk to a man

33:55.640 --> 33:59.119
Mr Keating would be willing
to help you with any problems.

33:59.119 --> 34:02.639
You don't want to end up like
your father. Or your mother.

34:02.639 --> 34:05.789
Put your bike in the back
please, Josh. Josh!

34:07.880 --> 34:09.598
Who are you?

34:09.599 --> 34:12.478
I'm Susan Gately, Josh's form tutor.
Who are you?

34:12.478 --> 34:15.478
I'm Anna. Josh's mother.

34:15.839 --> 34:18.360
Oh, dear. What's he been telling you?

34:18.360 --> 34:21.600
Nothing. It's just I was
surprised to see you driving,

34:21.600 --> 34:25.239
- what with Josh cycling.
- Have you seen him cycle?

34:25.280 --> 34:28.279
I told him he can't. He'll kill himself.

34:28.280 --> 34:30.840
Got on his bike before I could stop him.

34:30.840 --> 34:33.840
- Has he been behaving himself?
- Well...

34:33.918 --> 34:36.920
I knew I should have come in
instead of just writing.

34:36.920 --> 34:40.478
If it's any consolation,
I have no control over him either.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.598
Would you like a cup of tea?

34:42.599 --> 34:44.678
No, thanks. I can't stay.

34:44.679 --> 34:46.958
Perhaps something a little stronger?

34:46.958 --> 34:49.639
What? No, thank you.

34:49.639 --> 34:52.159
- What about his father?
- What about him?

34:52.159 --> 34:55.158
What does he think about all this?

34:55.159 --> 34:57.479
Does he have any influence on Josh?

34:57.479 --> 34:59.229
He doesn't have a father.

34:59.400 --> 35:04.040
Well, he's not an immaculate conception
but I wanted to have a child on my own.

35:04.040 --> 35:07.759
His father's a teacher,
which might be part of the problem.

35:07.759 --> 35:10.719
I must get back
before he trashes the house.

35:10.719 --> 35:13.559
- Can I come in and see you?
- Sure.

35:13.560 --> 35:16.879
Don't worry.
I'm not saying any of this is your fault.

35:16.879 --> 35:19.838
Josh is just... how he is.

35:19.839 --> 35:21.999
I'm sure he'll grow out of it one day.

35:21.999 --> 35:26.269
If he doesn't, well,
there's always death to look forward to.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.519
Oh, my God.

35:34.520 --> 35:37.520
She looks like me, she talks like me...

35:38.079 --> 35:40.959
(JP) At least she hasn't got
your drink problem.

35:40.959 --> 35:43.959
I am Josh's mother.

35:44.360 --> 35:46.638
OK, "Fuck off and die"

35:46.639 --> 35:49.929
or "I'd rather have my eyes
eaten out by rats."

35:54.439 --> 35:57.439
- What happened?
- She's found out she's Josh's mother.

35:57.439 --> 36:00.119
(Sighs)

36:00.120 --> 36:03.240
It was like seeing myself
with a really bad hangover.

36:03.240 --> 36:06.390
If I have a kid it will be exactly like Josh.

36:06.399 --> 36:08.398
Not if you brought him up.

36:08.399 --> 36:11.800
You could teach him...
how to take the piss out of me.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.560
Everyone takes the piss out of you.
That's human.

36:14.560 --> 36:17.439
No, it doesn't matter
how the fuck you bring them up.

36:17.439 --> 36:20.559
It's just a giant game
of pin the tail on the donkey.

36:20.559 --> 36:25.119
Oh, well. It was a nice idea while it lasted
but it's the right decision.

36:25.119 --> 36:28.899
- Let me buy you a drink.
- I haven't changed my mind.

36:29.439 --> 36:32.659
I'm pretty good at
pin the tail on the donkey.

36:33.839 --> 36:36.849

Well, do you know where he is?

37:43.280 --> 37:46.280

38:09.639 --> 38:11.478
How are you feeling today?

38:11.479 --> 38:16.099
Listen. I am never ever, ever,
ever, ever going to sleep with you.

38:17.640 --> 38:19.399
OK?

38:19.400 --> 38:22.400
And that goes for you, too.

38:38.759 --> 38:43.099
Hello, Josh. It was interesting
meeting your mother yesterday.

38:44.199 --> 38:47.240
Don't let her fool you.
She's not drunk all the time.

38:47.240 --> 38:50.159
- She goes on benders.
- Who can blame her?

38:50.159 --> 38:53.400
Did she tell you that crap
about my dad being a teacher?

38:53.400 --> 38:56.400
No. But we're meeting up next week.

38:57.519 --> 38:59.800
- What will you say to her?
- I don't know yet.

38:59.800 --> 39:03.280
I was thinking of asking her
whether your aggressive attitude

39:03.280 --> 39:06.120
is due to your insecurities
about your masculinity.

39:06.120 --> 39:08.560
But I'm sure I'll think of something.

39:08.560 --> 39:11.560
And if I don't...
I'll make something up.

39:12.719 --> 39:15.719
Shouldn't you be in class?

39:17.640 --> 39:20.800
If you're still in your own half,
you can't be offside.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.439
- Any questions?
- Yes, sir.

39:22.439 --> 39:25.939
Ashleigh wants to know
what the facts of life are.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.638
You know what? I'm not sure.

39:30.639 --> 39:33.078
Sounds like you know, though.

39:33.079 --> 39:36.199
Maybe you could let the rest of us in
on the secret.

39:36.199 --> 39:37.699
(Class sniggering)

39:42.479 --> 39:45.199
- Have you seen Simon?
- No, I fucking haven't.

39:45.199 --> 39:49.959
- If you find him before I do...
- Shit. Where the fuck is he, then?

39:52.319 --> 39:56.379
Miss Gately, I've been having trouble
with our assignment.

39:56.759 --> 39:58.959
Look at Skodak and Skeel's studies.

39:58.959 --> 40:01.800
Are you sure?
I thought they'd been discredited.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.839
- They haven't.
- My textbook says...

40:03.839 --> 40:07.829
For God's sake, do you have to question
everything I say?

40:08.680 --> 40:11.970
Shit. Katherine,
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

40:13.439 --> 40:15.479
I've just got a lot on my mind.

40:15.479 --> 40:17.360
- It's all right.
- No, it's not.

40:17.360 --> 40:20.510
- I shouldn't have...
- Don't worry about it.

40:32.920 --> 40:35.478
I've just shouted at Katherine.

40:35.479 --> 40:38.360
Good on you.
She's got too much respect for authority.

40:38.360 --> 40:41.320
The speed she can shoot
her right arm into the air

40:41.320 --> 40:43.400
has a touch of the Third Reich.

40:43.400 --> 40:47.480
If I can't keep my temper
with the most mild-mannered girl here,

40:47.480 --> 40:49.679
what kind of parent will I make?

40:49.679 --> 40:53.599
What kind of teacher you are
has nothing to do with that.

40:53.599 --> 40:55.559
Look at Kurt. He's a good teacher.

40:55.559 --> 40:59.559
Statistically, people are far happier
if they don't have kids.

40:59.559 --> 41:01.000
You sound like Simon.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.680
- Has anyone seen Simon this morning?
- What's the matter?

41:04.680 --> 41:06.959
I saw a horrible bike accident
on the way in.

41:06.959 --> 41:09.159
(Kurt) It can't have been Simon.

41:09.159 --> 41:13.149
He cycles on the pavement
cos he's scared of the traffic.

41:13.159 --> 41:16.600
He might have collided
with a tartan shopping bag on wheels.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.600
Those old ladies
can cut you up sometimes.

41:20.159 --> 41:22.879
If it was him,
you would have heard already.

41:22.879 --> 41:26.320
He doesn't carry anything with him
that says he's a teacher.

41:26.320 --> 41:30.200
- It'd affect his pulling power.
- I'll try his mobile again.

41:30.200 --> 41:33.038
He doesn't know how it works yet.

41:33.039 --> 41:35.438
Thinks it's a GameBoy that rings.

41:35.439 --> 41:38.359
- That's so mean.
- Shouldn't you have a mobile?

41:38.359 --> 41:39.859
Yeah, carry on.

41:44.040 --> 41:46.639
- Are you waiting for the phone?
- Yes, I am.

41:46.639 --> 41:49.639
- Great.
- Er...

41:50.960 --> 41:53.960
(Cries)

41:54.759 --> 41:57.400
Oh, no.
You haven't nicked one, have you?

41:57.400 --> 41:59.039
Where the hell have you been?

41:59.039 --> 42:00.999
At the dentist.
It was an emergency.

42:00.999 --> 42:04.280
- Bollocks it was.
- You're upsetting the baby!

42:04.280 --> 42:06.959
I don't care.
You could have at least phoned in.

42:06.959 --> 42:10.879
- I did. Well, I was going to.
- I've been worried sick.

42:11.199 --> 42:14.439
What are you so worked up about?
It was me having the filling.

42:14.439 --> 42:16.520
I just think you could have told me.

42:16.520 --> 42:19.520
Why? What's got into you?

42:22.319 --> 42:25.609
- Thanks, Miss.
- Next time it goes in the bin.

42:28.159 --> 42:30.560
Are you sure
you should be having a baby?

42:30.560 --> 42:33.279
- I'm not having a baby.
- What do you mean?

42:33.279 --> 42:36.680
I thought about having a baby
and I've decided not to for now.

42:36.680 --> 42:40.530
- Really? Why?
- I've never bungee jumped, for a start.

42:45.599 --> 42:47.679
- What are you smiling at?
- Nothing.

42:47.679 --> 42:50.959
Kayla's been straightening me out
about the facts of life.

42:50.959 --> 42:53.198
What did you tell him?

42:53.199 --> 42:56.199
Nothing. What you told me.

42:56.879 --> 42:59.879
We'll talk about this at home.

43:01.839 --> 43:05.059
- What was that all about?
- You're too young.

43:11.559 --> 43:14.959
I'm going to the pub now,
if that's all right by you.

43:14.959 --> 43:18.440
- Have you done your homework?
- Yes and I've been to the loo

43:18.440 --> 43:21.640
so we won't need to stop
in a lay-by on the way there.

43:21.640 --> 43:24.640
- Are you coming?
- If you twist my arm.

43:27.199 --> 43:31.539
Wait for me. I don't want you
accepting drinks from strangers.

43:38.360 --> 43:40.719
It's not just the bungee jumping, is it?

43:40.719 --> 43:43.719
You should have been a psychiatrist.

43:43.759 --> 43:47.259
- You can tell me.
- If I got so fucking worked up

43:47.720 --> 43:51.600
worrying about a waste of space like you
just cos you were late,

43:51.600 --> 43:55.310
imagine how I'd be waiting
for someone I cared about.

43:56.520 --> 43:59.520
- Stop it!
- Give 'em here!

44:09.400 --> 44:14.020
Besides, I think I've got enough
children to worry about as it is.

44:15.520 --> 44:18.520
We're still waiting.

44:18.879 --> 44:21.318
For your answer.

44:21.319 --> 44:24.319
Me, Simon or Brian?

44:24.719 --> 44:26.359
None of you.

44:26.360 --> 44:30.000
But the human race depends on it.
We're the last men on earth.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.130
- Mankind's doomed anyhow, then.
- The apes will take over.

44:34.520 --> 44:36.799
(Susan) You'll argue yourself
out of a shag.

44:36.799 --> 44:38.679
Oh, shit. Nine o'clock.

44:38.680 --> 44:42.880
To his left. Rat boy and Carol.
They've been here all night.

44:44.279 --> 44:45.759
Poor bastard.

44:45.759 --> 44:47.598
You know about spiders?

44:47.599 --> 44:49.760
I hope they're gonna be careful.

44:49.760 --> 44:52.718
Talking of which... Me, Kurt or Brian?

44:52.719 --> 44:55.718
I've gone off the idea of having kids.

44:55.719 --> 44:57.359
What? Since when?

44:57.360 --> 44:59.678
- Why?
- Why do you think?

44:59.679 --> 45:02.399
Can't drink and smoke
when you're pregnant.

45:02.399 --> 45:05.759
Besides, I might move in
next to a nuclear power station.

45:05.759 --> 45:08.078
Property prices are really cheap.

45:08.079 --> 45:11.079
Come on,
you've got to choose one of us.

45:11.240 --> 45:14.240
- Or what?
- Or we'll take it in turns.

45:15.800 --> 45:18.200
The human race
has to survive somehow.

45:18.200 --> 45:21.200
You know, I had a dream
about you three.

45:22.759 --> 45:25.759
- Did it involve sex?
- In a way.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.759
- What were you doing?
- I wasn't in it.

45:29.759 --> 45:32.759
It was just the three of you.

45:42.719 --> 45:46.359
