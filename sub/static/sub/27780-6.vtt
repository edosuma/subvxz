00:01.000 --> 00:03.879
<i>Previously on</i>
Project Blue Book...

00:03.960 --> 00:07.158
I didn't pay much attention to the stories
till I had my first encounter.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.197
With a UFO?

00:09.320 --> 00:11.755
"Unidentified Flying Object."
Hasn't caught on yet.

00:11.840 --> 00:15.277
I don't care if we have to drop a nuke
to take Fuller out.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.352
There's a lot of people
looking for you.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.955
There is where it all started.
It's the program.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.016
- Do you want to tell me about that?
- We get messages.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.040
<i>We're the antennas.</i>

00:23.120 --> 00:24.839
I keep seeing this.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.111
I'm sorry.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.200
No! Stop!

00:29.200 --> 00:32.192
<i>When you see someone die,
it's tempting to want to blame yourself.</i>

02:05.280 --> 02:06.634
That's nuts.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.120
Gary Cooper... every time.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.270
There's no way he could take John Wayne.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.676
The Duke? Man,
he's the toughest guy in the movies.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.195
Cooper's smart, you know?
You see it in his eyes.

02:15.320 --> 02:16.640
He's got tactical superiority.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.031
John Wayne would knock that tactical
bullshit right out of his head.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.837
<i>- T-minus 90 seconds.</i>
- What the hell is that?

02:26.920 --> 02:29.719
It's a launch alert.

02:35.040 --> 02:37.316
Come on, come on.

02:40.480 --> 02:41.960
What the hell is going on?!

02:42.040 --> 02:44.794
<i>Is this a drill?! Hello?!</i>

02:44.880 --> 02:48.715
<i>The test is supposed to be tomorrow, 0800!</i>

02:48.800 --> 02:51.160
The launch sequence started
on its own, we did not initiate.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.357
You need to evac the area now.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.319
Come on, come on!

03:01.320 --> 03:03.960
Hello?! Can anybody copy?

03:04.040 --> 03:05.599
Come on!

03:05.680 --> 03:08.070
<i>...20 seconds...</i>

03:08.160 --> 03:09.879
Shut down the whole system.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.320
Give me the codes. I'm trying!

03:11.400 --> 03:12.800
None of the overrides are working.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.276
<i>Override denied.</i>

03:17.520 --> 03:18.840
We're gonna nuke our own men.

03:18.920 --> 03:21.310
<i>- Ten, nine, eight...</i>
- Our Father, who art in heaven,

03:21.400 --> 03:23.756
hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come,

03:23.840 --> 03:26.275
thy will be done on Earth
as it is in heaven.

03:26.360 --> 03:29.717
<i>...four, three, two...</i>

03:32.280 --> 03:35.478
- What just happened?
<i>- Launch aborted.</i>

03:35.560 --> 03:36.880
It stopped.

03:38.320 --> 03:41.392
<i>Reset. Reset.
Safety systems one.</i>

03:41.480 --> 03:42.800
Countdown was reset.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.394
The missile's secure!

03:45.640 --> 03:47.438
Launch aborted.
I repeat, launch aborted.

03:47.520 --> 03:51.799
<i>I-I repeat, launch aborted.
All is clear.</i>

03:51.880 --> 03:54.475
<i>You're safe.</i>

04:01.280 --> 04:02.919
God heard my prayer.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.196
I don't think prayer
can stop a countdown.

04:05.280 --> 04:08.159
There's got to be some other explanation
than a Supreme Being.

04:14.440 --> 04:18.353
- Is that the missile?
- I don't know what that is.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.909
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

04:21.000 --> 04:22.616
...Thy kingdom come,

04:22.640 --> 04:24.376
thy will be done on Earth
as it is in heaven.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.432
<i>Everybody else
thinks I'm crazy, Doctor.</i>

05:26.280 --> 05:27.280
Allen?

05:35.160 --> 05:38.995
It's 2:00 in the morning.
What in the world are you doing?

05:39.080 --> 05:42.437
Good news. My camera matrix project
was approved... last minute.

05:42.520 --> 05:44.671
Okay, I have no idea
what any of that means.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.752
It means I have a lot of work to do.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.275
You've been cooped up in here
for two weeks.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.353
You never sleep, you barely eat.
You're scaring me.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.416
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Just go back to bed, please.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.920
No! Haven't you had enough of this?

05:56.040 --> 05:58.839
- Because I know <i>I</i> have.
- Mimi, please.

05:58.960 --> 06:03.477
That man, Fuller...
he was inside this house.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.080
The things he said...

06:05.160 --> 06:08.676
Can we please not talk about this
right now?! Please?!

06:11.600 --> 06:13.680
There are things I can't tell you.
I just... I can't.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.592
Are you leaving again?

06:21.600 --> 06:23.478
In the morning.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.358
Where?

06:25.440 --> 06:27.272
<i>White Forest.</i>

06:27.360 --> 06:29.591
<i>I have to go pack.</i>

06:29.680 --> 06:31.512
<i>Fine.</i>

06:50.360 --> 06:52.875
So, these green fireballs
at this missile base,

06:52.960 --> 06:55.919
- this camera can capture them on film?
- That's right.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.656
So how long have you been working
on this thing? You called it a what now?

06:59.680 --> 07:03.469
Three-dimensional observational matrix,
motion-activated,

07:03.560 --> 07:05.756
designed to record celestial events.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.992
Right. How come
you didn't tell me about it?

07:09.080 --> 07:12.312
Well, I submitted the, uh, proposal
to the Air Force years ago.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.914
They didn't get back to me,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.310
so after recent events,
I reached out to them again.

07:16.400 --> 07:20.838
Smart. You know, people start spotting
these green fireballs from Mars, and...

07:20.960 --> 07:24.670
They're not from Mars.
They're meteors.

07:25.680 --> 07:30.232
Well, whatever they are, I get why
the Generals want to pull the trigger now.

07:30.320 --> 07:33.154
Lot of people on edge after what happened.

07:33.240 --> 07:36.119
Yeah, well, that's all gonna
change now with my project...

07:36.200 --> 07:38.760
'cause I am going to use science
to reveal the truth.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.752
And while the truth might be sometimes

07:40.840 --> 07:43.514
less entertaining
than unfounded speculation,

07:43.600 --> 07:46.069
there's safety
in the certitude it provides.

07:46.160 --> 07:50.313
Right now, we all need to feel safe...
everyone.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.640
There's too much at stake.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.280
Hey, sir!

08:05.360 --> 08:07.360
Dink is goin' into town
to pick up some sandwiches.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.720
You want a pastrami?

08:08.840 --> 08:13.153
You askin' a grown man born
two city blocks from Katz's Delicatessen

08:13.240 --> 08:16.278
if he wants a pastrami sandwich
made in Nevada?

08:16.360 --> 08:17.794
I guess not.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.473
Good guess.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.797
<i>You saying I'm crazy?</i>

08:32.880 --> 08:35.918
Well, you did mention you stopped
the launch countdown with prayer.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.116
I'm not so sure about that anymore.

08:38.200 --> 08:42.797
What we <i>are</i> certain of is that we saw
something not of this world.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.759
Professor Hynek would agree with you.
Right, Doc?

08:45.840 --> 08:48.355
What you likely saw were meteors.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.431
These things came straight at us,

08:52.520 --> 08:55.035
then went along the horizon
and shot back up into the sky.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.634
Can a meteor do that?

08:56.720 --> 08:59.997
Under the right conditions...
low cloud cover, high humidity...

09:00.080 --> 09:02.754
light from below
can distort its path, yes.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.672
Could've been a flare, too.

09:04.760 --> 09:09.232
Plenty of GIs in the area with duffel bags
full of liberated ordnance,

09:09.360 --> 09:11.397
too much time on their hands.

09:11.480 --> 09:14.154
What kind of flare
can set off a launch countdown?

09:22.560 --> 09:24.233
Mister Secretary.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.835
Dr. Hynek.

09:26.960 --> 09:30.237
What do you think?
Can we get to the bottom of this?

09:30.320 --> 09:32.118
Once the matrix is in place,

09:32.200 --> 09:34.760
I am convinced you'll have
the proof that you need.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.792
And you're thinking
nothing more than meteors?

09:37.880 --> 09:39.997
Ah, it's the only logical explanation.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.912
Did the Generals
arrive with you as well, sir?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.912
Should we include them
in this conversation?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.071
The Generals are not here...
or involved.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.120
Any questions or concerns
you have moving forward,

09:48.160 --> 09:50.959
you run them through me.
Is that clear?

09:51.040 --> 09:52.918
Yes, sir,
but are they aware that...

09:53.000 --> 09:55.799
Is that clear?

09:56.800 --> 09:57.995
Yes, sir.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.240
Once you're set up, I'd like
to come and take a look.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.232
- You'll keep me posted?
- Of course.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.551
Great. Captain.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.073
What the hell did you do?

10:12.160 --> 10:14.720
You went behind Harding's
and Valentine's backs for this?

10:14.840 --> 10:17.309
I told you, the Air Force
rejected me once already.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.232
What, so you reached out to Fairchild?!

10:20.840 --> 10:22.976
You realize you just dropped us
right in the middle of a war

10:23.000 --> 10:24.753
between the Secretary of Defense

10:24.840 --> 10:26.832
and two of the most
powerful men in the Pentagon?

10:26.920 --> 10:30.038
That kind of war leads
to collateral damage... ours.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.750
That is a risk I'm willing to take.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.392
What the hell's gotten into you?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.911
<i>I see nothing of value here.</i>

11:23.000 --> 11:25.879
This silly astronomer is just
a stooge for the Air Force,

11:25.960 --> 11:28.236
chasing lights in the sky.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.789
That is not an important
relationship for us.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.633
It's a wild goose chase.

11:33.640 --> 11:37.793
Unless, of course, the relationship
you're so concerned with is with his wife.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.394
Professor Hynek is in Nevada

11:39.480 --> 11:41.711
at the White Forest
Missile Range right now.

11:41.800 --> 11:45.430
That's where the Americans test
their nuclear weapons.

11:45.520 --> 11:48.831
This is the breakthrough
we've been waiting for.

11:53.440 --> 11:57.195
We're needed elsewhere. Virginia.

11:57.320 --> 12:00.836
A former OSS agent
now working for the CIA.

12:00.920 --> 12:06.439
He has certain... vulnerabilities
that can be exploited.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.831
Our work here is done.
It's time for us to go.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.560
Get up.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.879
Hello.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.872
I know you.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.759
Yes. I'm a friend of Mimi's.

12:36.280 --> 12:40.672
Well, it was nice seeing you again.
I should get back to my friends.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.080
You, too.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.470
Who was that?

12:52.040 --> 12:54.077
Mimi's neighbor.
She's nobody.

12:55.320 --> 12:58.392
48 hours... I will get you your evidence.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.995
Or we say goodbye to Ohio.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.396
<i>Green is a very interesting color
in astronomy.</i>

13:06.480 --> 13:09.120
Our eyes are more sensitive
to green than any other color.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.476
That's why it's so often visible
in the night sky.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.832
These theodolite cameras
are going to record the green fireballs.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.276
Based on the soldiers' testimony,

13:17.400 --> 13:20.598
the fireballs flew overhead here,

13:20.680 --> 13:23.320
so this is as good a position
as any for the matrix.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.800
Right.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.951
Now, when a meteor
enters Earth's atmosphere,

13:27.040 --> 13:29.680
it burns to such a point
that its outer layer vaporizes,

13:29.760 --> 13:32.150
and the different... Can you...?

13:32.240 --> 13:35.517
Different metals in a meteor
burn with particular colors.

13:35.600 --> 13:39.560
The green comes from nickel, which is
the most common metal found in meteors.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.390
So, how do these things work, then?

13:46.480 --> 13:49.120
Well, each camera is fitted
with a motion sensor

13:49.200 --> 13:51.112
and any passing object triggers
a photograph

13:51.200 --> 13:52.680
and a picture of the three dials.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.752
Now, these show the time
the photo was taken,

13:54.840 --> 13:57.196
the azimuth angle,
and the angle of elevation.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.556
- Azimuth.
- Yeah.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.069
Right.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.389
They're just gonna blow 'em up...
why do they need faces?

14:08.480 --> 14:13.475
Realism is important to understand
the ramifications of a nuclear explosion.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.758
- Can you give me some help here?
- Give me a second, will ya?

14:31.760 --> 14:32.989
Hey!

14:47.240 --> 14:49.311
Halt or I'll shoot!

14:55.800 --> 14:57.200
Don't hurt me. Please.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.390
Please. Don't hurt me.

15:05.840 --> 15:09.754
Master Sergeant Edward Rizzuto.
Motor pool.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.240
That's me.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.994
How you feeling, Sergeant?
You all right?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.993
Scared.

15:17.080 --> 15:20.437
Like, uh, I saw something crazy.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.989
The green lights.

15:23.080 --> 15:26.357
Dang it. You... You know what?
I-I-I did this backwards...

15:26.440 --> 15:28.830
askin' how you feel before
the most important question.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.873
What question is that?

15:32.960 --> 15:34.400
What were you doing at the test site

15:34.480 --> 15:36.711
without authorization
or clearance in the first place?

15:41.200 --> 15:44.352
- Smoke?
- Yeah.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.039
Thanks.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.710
How deep in the shit am I?

15:59.800 --> 16:03.191
That depends on what you say next.

16:05.360 --> 16:09.513
I met this girl in town...
we got to talkin'.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.195
She heard about the green lights

16:12.280 --> 16:15.159
and practically begged me
to take her out to see them,

16:15.240 --> 16:18.756
so, um, I took her out to the target area.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.120
We drank our way through
a good bottle of Scotch,

16:22.200 --> 16:25.671
but I did most of the drinking.

16:25.760 --> 16:29.310
And, uh, next thing I know,
I'm waking up flat on my back.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.551
She's gone. She took the car,

16:31.640 --> 16:35.998
took all the money out of my wallet,
and left me stranded.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.994
- He's 100% full of shit.
- How do you mean?

16:43.080 --> 16:45.231
Drank a bottle of Scotch last night?

16:45.320 --> 16:47.596
- I didn't smell it on him.
- So?

16:47.680 --> 16:51.037
And his hands. You see his hands
after I gave him that cigarette?

16:51.120 --> 16:53.840
Steady as a rock when he says
he was scared out of his mind.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.760
The man's telling us a story
that doesn't hold up.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.560
Master Sergeant
of the White Forest Missile Range,

17:00.640 --> 17:03.360
and he's hiding something.
We got to find out what that is.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.193
No, we don't.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.954
Look, not every case we're trying to solve
comes out of the sky.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.656
Remember, there was nearly a nuclear
launch here that no one can explain.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.353
This guy's runnin' around telling s...

17:12.440 --> 17:15.160
Our job is to observe the meteors
and capture them on film.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.391
That man is not our problem.

17:19.160 --> 17:23.313
I'm going back into the field to finish
my work. You do whatever you want.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.792
<i>I say when the cat's away,
the mice get to have a little fun.</i>

17:45.160 --> 17:47.516
It <i>has</i> been fun.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.674
<i>♪...that you'll always love me ♪</i>

17:51.760 --> 17:54.229
What's going on, Mimi?
You don't seem like yourself.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.116
I'm sorry.
It's just...

17:58.200 --> 18:02.240
Is it that man that broke into your house?
I know <i>I</i> still can't get over it.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.551
<i>♪...my side ♪</i>

18:04.640 --> 18:06.233
It's Allen.

18:06.320 --> 18:10.314
Something happened recently,
and I don't know what.

18:10.440 --> 18:14.320
But he's hurting in a way
I've never seen before.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.153
<i>♪ I, I would die ♪</i>

18:17.200 --> 18:19.271
I wonder what it is.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.955
Could it have something to do
with his job?

18:22.040 --> 18:24.396
What is it called again?
Blue Book?

18:29.120 --> 18:32.716
Ever since he started there,
he's had to be so secretive.

18:32.840 --> 18:36.516
I know there's more he's hiding,
but he just won't talk about it.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.160
Well, then you've got to do
something about that.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.630
For your own sake...
for Allen's, too.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.191
I try, but he just keeps pushing me out.

18:45.280 --> 18:47.556
What am I supposed to do?

18:49.120 --> 18:51.476
<i>♪ So, darling ♪</i>

18:52.480 --> 18:54.711
You're his wife, Mimi.

18:56.040 --> 18:57.679
If he won't tell you the truth,

18:57.760 --> 19:00.673
then you have every right
to find it out for yourself.

20:04.840 --> 20:07.116
<i>What are you doing here,
Dr. Hynek?</i>

20:07.200 --> 20:08.634
<i>I want to help you.</i>

20:08.720 --> 20:10.757
<i>The encounters...
we get messages.</i>

20:10.840 --> 20:13.480
<i>We're the antennas.
There's nothing anyone can do.</i>

22:22.840 --> 22:24.433
Do you need help?

22:39.400 --> 22:45.351
The, uh, the strobing of those lights...
it must've, ah...

22:46.360 --> 22:49.273
How are you here?

22:49.360 --> 22:51.750
I'm here when you need me.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.633
I'm here when <i>I</i> need <i>you.</i>

22:54.720 --> 22:57.758
Could you speak to me
in plain English for once?

22:57.840 --> 23:00.753
Good. You're nearly ready.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.399
Ready for what?

23:02.480 --> 23:07.077
There's a church in town.
St. Dominic's.

23:07.160 --> 23:10.119
Dominic de Guzman
was a Castilian priest...

23:10.240 --> 23:12.960
patron saint of the astronomers.

23:13.040 --> 23:16.158
The church bell rings
every day at noon.

23:16.240 --> 23:20.280
When you get your head together,
come find me.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.591
Then we can talk.

23:24.480 --> 23:27.393
Don't you dare leave me like this again.

23:27.480 --> 23:31.030
They're coming back.
You have work to do.

24:13.440 --> 24:14.920
What are you?

24:26.000 --> 24:28.231
I feel like a trespasser
in my own home.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.829
Isn't that part of the problem
you're trying to solve?

24:33.200 --> 24:35.795
I couldn't do this if you weren't here.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.440
You mean a lot to me.
I'm just happy to help.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.750
The box.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.911
I think I found something.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.280
What is it?

25:49.400 --> 25:50.834
It's a journal...

25:52.120 --> 25:54.476
about his cases.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.874
From West Virginia...

25:59.720 --> 26:01.598
"Lieutenant Fuller."

26:03.640 --> 26:08.078
"Fuller was just a boy. Lost.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.675
I had no idea how much.

26:10.760 --> 26:12.717
And whatever they did to him,

26:12.840 --> 26:16.277
whatever they subjected him to...
it broke his mind."

26:18.560 --> 26:20.631
"I tried to help him.
I begged him not to...

26:21.840 --> 26:24.355
kill himself...

26:24.440 --> 26:26.159
but he did,

26:26.240 --> 26:29.074
and all I could do
was stand there and...

26:30.560 --> 26:32.119
watch him."

26:36.120 --> 26:38.476
Susie, I'm... I'm sorry.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.358
I-I just... I think I need...

26:40.440 --> 26:44.354
Could I just have
some time alone? I-I...

26:44.440 --> 26:45.760
I understand.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.550
Oh. Hello.

27:11.640 --> 27:13.040
Hello, Donna.

27:14.360 --> 27:15.874
Is Mimi home?

27:15.960 --> 27:18.520
She's busy right now.
I can tell her you stopped by.

27:18.600 --> 27:22.753
Okay. Sure. Thanks.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.753
It was really nice
seeing you yesterday.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.435
I wish I could have introduced you
to my husband,

27:28.520 --> 27:30.239
but it just wasn't a good time.

27:30.320 --> 27:33.313
Not a problem. Have a good night.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.760
<i>Rizzuto's a Russian spy.</i>

28:04.440 --> 28:07.717
Born in the U.S. to Bolshevik parents,

28:07.800 --> 28:11.032
Party member since he was in short pants.

28:11.120 --> 28:13.680
Your instincts were right on the money.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.956
Jesus.

28:18.040 --> 28:22.000
He works at the damn motor pool
at the base. How'd they miss that?

28:22.080 --> 28:25.391
Enlisted. We don't catch everyone.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.269
What about his ledger?

28:29.360 --> 28:32.831
We believe it's being used by Ivan
to encrypt communication.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.991
The Verona boys
are working their way through it.

28:35.080 --> 28:39.632
So this traitor is gathering intelligence
on our missile tests?

28:42.400 --> 28:44.437
Sirs?

28:46.200 --> 28:49.352
That may not be the whole story.

28:49.440 --> 28:51.511
The green fireballs?

28:51.600 --> 28:53.239
You're kiddin' me.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.437
Son, we wish we were.

28:56.920 --> 28:59.719
We're investigating the possibility
that they're artificial devices

28:59.840 --> 29:02.560
created by the Soviets
to monitor our test sites.

29:03.560 --> 29:06.712
So those bastards are runnin'
missions on our soil now?

29:06.800 --> 29:09.395
One way or another, yes.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.870
But the American people
can never know that.

29:11.960 --> 29:15.351
More importantly, we can't let
the Russians know that we know.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.395
Which brings us to the Professor's
camera project,

29:20.480 --> 29:23.393
the project that we rejected,
the project that Fairchild

29:23.480 --> 29:25.073
is running behind our backs.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.431
What do you need me to do?

29:43.360 --> 29:44.760
We need to talk.

29:48.960 --> 29:50.599
Or I could talk
and you could listen.

29:55.120 --> 29:58.636
They're shutting us down.
Cased closed. Time to go home.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.193
No.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.395
You know, when I was
workin' interrogation,

30:11.480 --> 30:15.030
the best way to break a man,
break him so his mind played tricks?

30:15.120 --> 30:18.238
- Don't let him sleep.
- Well, my mind has never been sharper.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.710
Yeah, I can see that.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.917
I don't believe
the fireballs were meteors.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.616
- Your fancy cameras tell you that?
- I-I haven't developed the film,

30:25.640 --> 30:27.916
but I am confident that they
will confirm my thesis, yes.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.520
Oh, well, as long as you're confident.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.640
I know what I saw!

30:37.120 --> 30:39.271
Well, here's what I see...

30:39.360 --> 30:41.716
a witness who hasn't slept in weeks,

30:41.800 --> 30:46.352
whose mind is bouncin' around in his head
like a pinball in a pinball machine.

30:46.440 --> 30:47.920
He's angry all the time.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.719
When he's not angry,
he's confused.

30:49.800 --> 30:52.998
Now, this witness, this man,
has a story to tell,

30:53.120 --> 30:56.113
but not a shred of proof to back up
his claim other than his say-so...

30:56.200 --> 30:59.591
I'll develop the film.
I'll prove it to you.

30:59.680 --> 31:03.959
That's a negative. We are done here...
finished like it never happened.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.554
What the hell did you expect?

31:05.640 --> 31:07.757
I expected to discover the truth.

31:07.840 --> 31:11.834
I expected a partner
who would back me up!

31:12.840 --> 31:15.275
You went to Fairchild
when the Generals weren't lookin'.

31:15.360 --> 31:19.274
You got caught. I warned you about that.
And what we're facin' now?

31:19.360 --> 31:21.397
Just the consequences
of your own actions.

31:23.400 --> 31:28.236
I wanted the truth.
I wanted to forget.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.835
Okay? Now just leave me alone. Please?

31:38.240 --> 31:40.038
First time I saw a man die up close?

31:41.800 --> 31:46.477
I couldn't get it out of my head...
no matter how hard I tried.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.795
I know you're hurting about Fuller.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.917
But the hurt will pass 'cause it has to.

31:54.520 --> 31:57.957
And then one day,
his death is just gonna be a...

31:58.040 --> 32:00.509
a very bad thing
that you don't think about anymore.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.751
Professor Hynek.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.360
So nice to see you again.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.919
You know what I love
about churches, Dr. Hynek?

32:47.960 --> 32:51.317
They were built as a haven
for those who suffer.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.869
But to suffer is to endure, is it not?

33:02.720 --> 33:04.757
Who are you?

33:06.720 --> 33:08.677
You do know those were not meteors.

33:08.760 --> 33:13.516
The abnormally low velocity
is proof of that, yes...

33:13.600 --> 33:18.072
and the fact that the flight path
doesn't match that of a meteor shower.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.517
Which are horizontal, not perpendicular
to the Earth's surface.

33:34.320 --> 33:35.549
So...

33:37.240 --> 33:40.916
do you have a hypothesis
as to their origin, Doctor?

33:41.000 --> 33:42.639
Russian surveillance.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.638
Experimental spy craft of some kind,

33:48.720 --> 33:52.316
but the technology...
it's too advanced.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.512
It's impossible.

33:56.600 --> 34:00.389
Then forget about the science
for a moment.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.711
What can you imagine they are?

34:05.600 --> 34:08.672
A craft of some kind.

34:09.679 --> 34:14.800
Piloted, not, uh, random.

34:16.040 --> 34:19.556
Here to survey our nuclear-testing sites,

34:19.639 --> 34:25.193
as if someone, something, were monitoring
what progress we've made.

34:26.199 --> 34:30.114
I'm not sure I'd call it "progress,"
but you're on the right track.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.431
The only open question is...

34:34.280 --> 34:37.398
what if whoever is watching

34:37.480 --> 34:41.871
has determined that we've made more
progress than they're willing to allow?

34:46.280 --> 34:48.431
That's what Fuller said to my wife.

34:48.520 --> 34:52.400
You do know Lieutenant Fuller's death
was not your fault.

34:52.480 --> 34:56.838
What do you know about all of this?
Who... Who is watching our progress?

34:56.920 --> 34:59.833
If I had all the answers,
I wouldn't need you, would I?

35:01.000 --> 35:02.320
Need me?

35:04.440 --> 35:07.194
What the hell
do you need me for?

35:19.960 --> 35:22.759
And we'll be out of there,
just as you ordered.

35:24.600 --> 35:25.795
Is that for us?

35:28.760 --> 35:30.513
Amended to state conclusively

35:30.600 --> 35:34.389
the green fireballs
were nothing more than meteors.

35:36.160 --> 35:37.753
Thank you, Professor.

35:39.520 --> 35:41.034
- Captain.
- Sir.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.520
Professor.

35:44.400 --> 35:48.280
- Oh, uh, Professor, one more thing.
- Yes?

35:50.640 --> 35:54.031
I brought you into
Project Blue Book, didn't I?

35:54.120 --> 35:56.396
Uh, yes, you did.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.631
Might even say you owe me.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.719
Yes.

36:01.800 --> 36:06.033
Good. Just wanted to be clear about that.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.554
Very clear. Thank you.

36:16.160 --> 36:19.756
But if you ever go behind my back
to Fairchild again,

36:19.840 --> 36:22.309
you and I are gonna have
a difficult conversation.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.869
And then I'll shit-can you so fast,
your head will spin.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.793
Professor.

36:44.360 --> 36:47.273
I've got to dismantle the rest
of my equipment. I'll meet you later.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.634
Roger that.

36:54.000 --> 36:58.791
<i>About every 75 years,
Halley's comet returns to us.</i>

37:02.240 --> 37:03.435
<i>And on the day I was born...</i>

37:06.040 --> 37:10.034
<i>...the comet flew closer
to Earth than ever before.</i>

37:11.240 --> 37:14.153
<i>People were terrified.</i>

37:14.240 --> 37:15.720
<i>They thought it was an omen...</i>

37:17.600 --> 37:19.319
<i>signaling the end of the world.</i>

37:22.600 --> 37:24.592
<i>But my mother didn't agree.</i>

37:26.880 --> 37:29.679
<i>She believed
it was an omen, yes.</i>

37:31.240 --> 37:33.755
<i>But an omen that announced my birth.</i>

37:36.760 --> 37:40.231
<i>And she believed that I would be
a man of great accomplishment...</i>

37:41.440 --> 37:44.080
<i>like a comet blazing across the sky.</i>

37:45.120 --> 37:46.952
But the truth is...

37:49.760 --> 37:51.479
...I never was.

37:53.720 --> 37:56.440
If there's one thing I know,
it's this.

37:59.080 --> 38:01.311
<i>You have no idea
what kind of man you can be.</i>

38:24.680 --> 38:26.478
I owe you a thank-you.

38:27.920 --> 38:32.711
That key you made
opened a box in Hynek's desk.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.880
In there was a journal
filled with entries about his work.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.075
And just as I thought,

38:42.160 --> 38:46.791
the Professor is doing much more
than chasing lights in the sky.

38:51.200 --> 38:55.672
He's investigating
experimental weapons... mind control.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.437
Do you have the journal?

39:01.840 --> 39:04.355
I told you I needed hard evidence.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.352
I'm closer than I've ever been.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.911
I just need you
to stay out of my way.

39:12.360 --> 39:15.751
Neither one of us can afford
to be careless right now.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.553
I'm glad you feel that way...

39:21.960 --> 39:24.156
because there's something
I need you to do.

39:35.320 --> 39:37.960
I think you'll find
a hand saw works best.

39:54.560 --> 39:58.918
Mr. Rizzuto, we're going
to have a conversation.

40:21.240 --> 40:22.959
You're still up.

40:25.440 --> 40:28.672
Mimi, I'm sorry.

40:30.400 --> 40:31.800
I haven't been myself.

40:32.800 --> 40:34.960
- The way I treated you the other night...
- Was wrong.

40:36.240 --> 40:38.596
And not like you at all.

41:10.080 --> 41:13.869
From now on, you and I...

41:15.440 --> 41:17.033
we are going to work as a team.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.191
No more secrets.

41:42.800 --> 41:46.111
- Should it be heavier?
- Yes, it should be.

41:47.160 --> 41:48.833
Allen, what is this?

41:48.920 --> 41:50.673
I don't know.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.957
But we are going to find out...

41:57.000 --> 41:58.400
together.

42:10.960 --> 42:16.592
<i>Eight, one, five, four,
five, six, five, nine.</i>
