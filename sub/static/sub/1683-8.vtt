00:00.100 --> 00:02.267
<i>Previously on Sleepy Hollow...</i>

00:02.650 --> 00:04.728
Andy?
You're supposed to be dead.

00:04.751 --> 00:06.952
ANDY: The Horseman won't stop
coming after you

00:06.987 --> 00:09.355
until he gets his head.

00:09.389 --> 00:11.624
My sister, Jenny. She's getting out
of the institution tomorrow.

00:11.658 --> 00:14.368
Hessians... German soldiers
loyal to the British Crown.

00:14.403 --> 00:16.896
- Like the Horseman.
- ANDY: You can't kill Death.

00:16.930 --> 00:18.731
But you can trap him.
It's the only way

00:18.765 --> 00:21.233
- you can defeat him.
- ABBIE: Crane?

00:21.268 --> 00:22.535
Now!

00:30.544 --> 00:32.812
(Chains clattering)

00:32.846 --> 00:34.380
(Heavy latch secured)

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:52.265 --> 00:53.265
Okay.

00:53.300 --> 00:55.634
I want to show you something.

00:57.437 --> 00:58.871
Fist bump.

00:58.905 --> 01:00.773
I beg your pardon?

01:00.807 --> 01:03.843
It's an expression of...elation.

01:03.877 --> 01:05.678
Teamwork.

01:05.712 --> 01:06.746
We got him.

01:12.719 --> 01:14.653
Huh. Fist bump.

01:16.556 --> 01:18.424
(Blows, chuckles)

01:18.458 --> 01:20.159
Makes no sense.

01:28.568 --> 01:29.969
Hard to believe.

01:30.003 --> 01:31.570
Impossible.

01:31.605 --> 01:33.539
And yet, here we are.

01:33.573 --> 01:35.608
I'm tempted to dial in NORAD.

01:35.642 --> 01:37.710
Drop a nuke down here
and call it a day.

01:37.744 --> 01:39.378
I'm afraid it and the cockroaches

01:39.413 --> 01:41.614
will still be standing.
We've tried killing this thing

01:41.648 --> 01:43.449
a thousand ways to Sunday.

01:43.483 --> 01:45.251
I put a bullet in his chest.

01:47.521 --> 01:50.790
And cut off his head.
(Grunts)

01:50.824 --> 01:52.892
ABBIE: And we filled this cell
with his personal Kryptonite.

01:52.926 --> 01:56.328
Those hex candles
from the Mason's supply.

01:56.363 --> 01:58.898
The strongest UV lights
on the open market.

01:58.932 --> 02:02.568
- It's weakened him, but...
- Here he stands before us.

02:02.602 --> 02:05.337
As monstrous as the man
I met on the battlefield

02:05.372 --> 02:07.072
more than two centuries ago.

02:07.107 --> 02:09.508
If we can't destroy him,
what do you suggest? Let him

02:09.543 --> 02:12.411
- rot down here?
- The cell is secure.

02:12.446 --> 02:14.113
Thomas Jefferson designed it.

02:14.147 --> 02:16.348
Alongside his wife's witch coven,

02:16.383 --> 02:19.318
who put a supernatural hex
around it to keep the evil out.

02:19.352 --> 02:23.255
I can hardly believe Jefferson foresaw
holding a headless man prisoner.

02:23.290 --> 02:24.590
He foresaw holding the worst

02:24.624 --> 02:27.159
type of demons
that may walk the earth.

02:27.194 --> 02:30.996
A product, no doubt, of his years
trying to reason with the French.

02:32.232 --> 02:34.333
No matter what happens
with the Horseman,

02:34.367 --> 02:36.335
others are coming.

02:36.369 --> 02:39.305
Witches, demons, Sandmen.

02:39.339 --> 02:42.641
Sir, as crazy as this sounds,

02:42.676 --> 02:44.610
this war has just begun.

02:44.644 --> 02:49.181
Then perhaps we treat him
as any other captured enemy.

02:49.216 --> 02:51.884
He rode into Sleepy Hollow
for a reason. He knows

02:51.918 --> 02:54.119
what evil is planning to attack next.

02:54.154 --> 02:56.555
IRVING:
You want to interrogate the Horseman.

02:57.924 --> 03:00.025
I don't think he's gonna talk.

03:00.060 --> 03:03.162
Or maybe he'll talk to someone
who's already dead.

03:04.498 --> 03:06.365
Of course.

03:06.399 --> 03:08.734
Your former friend, Officer Brooks.

03:08.768 --> 03:10.369
As in the late
Detective Andy Brooks?

03:10.403 --> 03:12.705
He delivered a message
to the Horseman for us before.

03:12.739 --> 03:15.641
- They must communicate.
- Last I heard, he was dead.

03:15.675 --> 03:17.510
Rules on that status
have gotten a little bendy.

03:17.544 --> 03:19.378
He's unhappily resurrected.

03:19.412 --> 03:21.247
Deployed as an agent for Moloch.

03:21.281 --> 03:24.350
Moloch, the demon
on the top of the org chart?

03:24.384 --> 03:26.919
Which begs the question...
How can we trust Brooks?

03:26.953 --> 03:29.555
I believe he truly regrets his lot.

03:29.589 --> 03:32.157
He's already aided us
in capturing the Horseman.

03:32.192 --> 03:35.628
And he still holds unrequited
feelings for Ms. Mills.

03:36.796 --> 03:39.765
- Seriously?
- Sir, we can track down Brooks.

03:39.799 --> 03:41.667
If you could get in touch
with my sister, I think

03:41.701 --> 03:43.102
she could be useful.

03:43.136 --> 03:45.771
Didn't she just get out
of Tarrytown Psychiatric?

03:45.805 --> 03:47.773
Yesterday.

03:47.807 --> 03:49.275
She deserves to know.

03:49.309 --> 03:51.744
A dead guy, a mental patient...

03:51.778 --> 03:54.213
and a time traveler
from the Revolution.

03:55.749 --> 03:57.883
That's our team.

03:59.619 --> 04:01.987
(Birds chirping)

04:04.157 --> 04:05.624
Thought I heard a deer.

04:05.659 --> 04:06.792
You see it?

04:06.826 --> 04:08.494
Not yet.

04:09.396 --> 04:12.565
(Horse neighs)

04:14.000 --> 04:15.134
Whoa.

04:18.738 --> 04:21.640
(Neighs, snorts)

04:21.675 --> 04:22.875
What the hell?

04:22.909 --> 04:24.443
Agreed.

04:24.477 --> 04:25.844
(Chuckles)

04:42.033 --> 04:44.964
What is that, German?

05:02.449 --> 05:06.719
We last saw Brooks
in this section up ahead.

05:14.127 --> 05:16.028
Ugh.

05:16.062 --> 05:18.364
This must be his closet.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.002
It's bigger than mine,
I'll give him that.

05:23.036 --> 05:28.273
It appears our undead informant
is out on the town.

05:28.308 --> 05:30.275
Andy's a creature of habit.

05:30.310 --> 05:33.212
If this is where he lives,
this is where he'll come back.

05:44.257 --> 05:46.225
Jennifer Mills.

05:46.259 --> 05:48.460
I'm Captain Frank Irving.

05:48.495 --> 05:49.862
I'll take it from here.

05:49.896 --> 05:51.897
Captain.

05:51.931 --> 05:56.802
I'm all for renditioning innocent Americans
while they're sitting at a cafÃ©,

05:56.836 --> 05:59.672
enjoying a soy latte
and some free Wi-Fi.

05:59.706 --> 06:01.540
No warrant.
No lawyer present.

06:01.574 --> 06:02.908
You weren't answering your phone.

06:02.942 --> 06:03.742
Now you see why.

06:03.777 --> 06:05.110
My office.

06:12.585 --> 06:14.987
Have a seat.

06:15.021 --> 06:20.033
First day out of Tarrytown Psychiatric.
How you doing?

06:20.068 --> 06:22.027
I already have a P.O.
and a shrink that I report to,

06:22.062 --> 06:23.762
so I don't need another shoulder.

06:23.797 --> 06:26.365
- Your sister asked me to find you.
- And where's she?

06:26.399 --> 06:28.434
- On assignment.
- She can't even pick up her phone.

06:28.468 --> 06:31.704
- Typical Abbie, already...
- You don't like authority. I get it.

06:31.738 --> 06:33.572
I know about your past.
You told the truth

06:33.606 --> 06:35.708
about what you and your
sister saw as kids, and

06:35.742 --> 06:37.943
the system failed you.

06:37.977 --> 06:39.745
What do you know about any of this?

06:39.779 --> 06:42.448
Do you even really know
where she is right now?

06:42.482 --> 06:45.751
Abbie asked me to track you down
because she's with the Horseman.

06:45.785 --> 06:48.587
One of the Four Horsemen.

06:48.621 --> 06:50.089
We captured him.

06:52.826 --> 06:54.126
"We"?

06:54.160 --> 06:56.195
Cut your sister some slack.

06:56.229 --> 06:58.797
She got a pretty good excuse
for being out of touch.

06:58.832 --> 07:01.200
I want to see him.

07:01.234 --> 07:03.268
He's in a Masonic cell

07:03.303 --> 07:07.706
that's supposed to be strong
enough to hold him, but...

07:07.741 --> 07:10.576
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

07:10.610 --> 07:12.745
You helped your sister before.

07:12.779 --> 07:15.280
Abbie wants me to bring you in to
this, says you'll be valuable.

07:15.315 --> 07:17.483
I'd like to believe her, but so far

07:17.517 --> 07:19.485
you haven't
given me any confidence.

07:20.687 --> 07:22.488
(Knocking)
Yeah, come in.

07:22.522 --> 07:26.592
Sir, there's a situation
at Adams Antiquities.

07:26.626 --> 07:27.893
10-65 in progress.

07:27.927 --> 07:29.962
Alarm company called it in.

07:29.996 --> 07:30.829
Adams?

07:34.200 --> 07:35.634
You know the place?

07:35.668 --> 07:37.636
Yeah, I used to do work
for the owner.

07:37.670 --> 07:39.905
Freelance acquisitions.

07:39.939 --> 07:41.540
What kind of acquisitions?

07:43.009 --> 07:44.243
(Derisive chuckle)

07:44.277 --> 07:45.344
Fine.

07:45.378 --> 07:46.812
Stay put till I get back.

07:46.846 --> 07:48.914
Wait.

07:48.948 --> 07:50.082
Hey.

07:50.116 --> 07:51.283
What do you want from me?

07:51.317 --> 07:52.618
Do you see these people?

07:52.652 --> 07:54.319
They don't understand.

07:54.354 --> 07:56.355
Hopefully they never will.

07:56.389 --> 07:59.124
At least not on my watch.
But I'm new to this,

07:59.159 --> 08:01.527
and you've spent the last
12 years of your life

08:01.561 --> 08:03.695
thinking about the day
the demons will rise.

08:03.730 --> 08:06.598
You can go it alone
or you can help us.

08:06.633 --> 08:08.667
But I need to know...

08:08.701 --> 08:10.903
Are you in or out?

08:13.406 --> 08:14.373
In.

08:14.407 --> 08:15.908
Then let's take a ride.

08:20.547 --> 08:23.048
Metamorphosis.

08:23.082 --> 08:24.716
It's appropriate for Brooks.

08:24.751 --> 08:26.618
You should check it out, too.

08:26.653 --> 08:29.221
You know, there's been some
pretty good American literature

08:29.255 --> 08:31.723
- in the last 200 years.
- Yes,

08:31.758 --> 08:33.192
I've discovered Twain,

08:33.226 --> 08:37.296
Faulkner...
fascinating Southerner.

08:37.330 --> 08:41.200
though we should discuss...

08:41.234 --> 08:44.169
books.

08:44.203 --> 08:47.406
These are Egyptian hieroglyphs.

08:47.440 --> 08:50.209
- Put that down!
- Andy.

08:50.243 --> 08:54.146
Abbie. What are you doing here?
What's he doing here?

08:54.180 --> 08:56.148
We've been looking for you.

08:56.182 --> 08:58.417
We're hoping you can help us.

08:58.451 --> 09:01.653
I already told you how to trap
the Horseman. You have him,

09:01.688 --> 09:03.755
- don't you?
- We want to know his weakness.

09:04.791 --> 09:06.391
How do we break him?

09:06.426 --> 09:07.693
You don't.

09:07.727 --> 09:09.061
You don't break him.

09:09.095 --> 09:10.429
You leave him be.

09:10.463 --> 09:13.065
There is a way
to communicate with him.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.501
Through you.

09:16.536 --> 09:19.571
These are Egyptian symbols
for communicating with the dead.

09:19.606 --> 09:21.974
You're his necromancer.

09:23.209 --> 09:24.776
Necromancer?

09:24.811 --> 09:28.080
An appointed one who has the
power to speak for the dead.

09:28.114 --> 09:30.415
You're his voice, aren't you?

09:32.385 --> 09:34.453
I am.

09:34.487 --> 09:37.522
Then this is your chance
at redemption. Come with us,

09:37.557 --> 09:39.958
allow us to unearth the man within.

09:39.993 --> 09:41.727
You want to bring Brooks to the cell?

09:41.761 --> 09:44.763
Yes, to speak to the Horseman.

09:44.797 --> 09:47.232
It's a calculated risk
but one we must take

09:47.267 --> 09:48.867
to gain ground in this war.

09:48.902 --> 09:51.136
We'll take every precaution.

09:51.170 --> 09:52.838
Abbie, please don't make me do this.

09:59.779 --> 10:03.448
You said you wanted to help me.

10:03.483 --> 10:05.651
I do.

10:05.685 --> 10:07.920
But you got to understand,

10:07.954 --> 10:10.389
the decisions I made when I was alive,

10:10.423 --> 10:12.457
I can't take back.

10:14.961 --> 10:17.129
My soul doesn't
belong to me anymore.

10:20.533 --> 10:23.468
When he visits...

10:23.503 --> 10:26.505
I have no choice
but to obey his commands.

10:26.539 --> 10:28.907
I help you

10:28.942 --> 10:30.742
when I can,

10:30.777 --> 10:34.780
but if you put me in there with him,
it is not gonna end well.

10:34.814 --> 10:37.516
How do I know
I can even trust you now?

10:37.550 --> 10:38.784
You can't.

10:42.188 --> 10:44.323
But believe this...

10:44.357 --> 10:46.858
Confronting Death...

10:46.893 --> 10:48.727
leads to nothing but misery.

10:50.563 --> 10:53.598
It's a darkness
that'll haunt you forever.

10:53.633 --> 10:55.233
All right.

10:56.803 --> 10:58.070
This way.

11:00.907 --> 11:03.508
Please.

11:12.518 --> 11:13.719
CRANE:
No. Apologies.

11:13.753 --> 11:16.555
It's this way.

11:18.891 --> 11:21.893
(Indistinct radio chatter)

11:31.037 --> 11:33.805
Hey. Hands in the open.

11:33.840 --> 11:37.576
They broke the jewelry case
and left all the most expensive stuff.

11:37.610 --> 11:38.710
This all just seems...

11:40.246 --> 11:42.447
(Cash register rings)
Faked?

11:45.351 --> 11:47.686
A diversion, but why?

11:50.089 --> 11:51.556
I got to show you something.

11:58.131 --> 11:59.531
(Squeaking)

11:59.565 --> 12:00.532
(Thump)

12:00.566 --> 12:01.833
(Creaking)

12:01.868 --> 12:06.071
Adams used to hide
his most valuable merch in here.

12:06.105 --> 12:08.240
(Door creaking)

12:14.247 --> 12:16.648
- Jenny...
- Adams!

12:18.317 --> 12:19.951
He's shot!

12:19.986 --> 12:21.286
Get a medic in here.

12:22.722 --> 12:24.756
- (Groans)
- Over here.

12:26.893 --> 12:31.797
ADAMS: (Panting) Second shelf.
The box. Bring it over.

12:38.404 --> 12:40.439
ADAMS:
Did they get it?

12:40.473 --> 12:41.473
JENNY:
It's empty.

12:45.745 --> 12:48.814
16th century Druidic scripture.

12:52.351 --> 12:53.385
What was in it?

12:53.419 --> 12:54.486
Thracian Phiale.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.955
A ancient relic, allegedly protected

12:56.989 --> 13:00.926
by warlocks after Cromwell's
conquest of Britain.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.394
Why would someone
want something like that?

13:02.428 --> 13:03.495
You wouldn't.

13:03.529 --> 13:06.331
Not unless you wanted
to break a hex-spell.

13:06.365 --> 13:09.935
Like the one protecting
the Horseman's cell.

13:11.204 --> 13:12.904
Who did this?

13:12.939 --> 13:14.573
They spoke German to each other.

13:14.607 --> 13:15.540
Hessians.

13:18.611 --> 13:19.478
Go.

13:19.512 --> 13:21.279
- Go.
- Come on.

13:21.314 --> 13:22.814
If the Hessians know
where the Horseman is,

13:22.849 --> 13:24.516
they can use the Phiale
to remove the hex.

13:24.550 --> 13:26.918
We've got the Horseman weak
under the U.V. lights.

13:26.953 --> 13:28.320
Not if they cut the power.

13:28.354 --> 13:30.021
They're gonna
take out the grid next.

13:30.056 --> 13:33.658
We need to call Abbie on the way.

13:50.977 --> 13:53.211
Consider yourself warned.

13:54.247 --> 13:56.248
Considered.

14:12.916 --> 14:18.508

14:50.239 --> 14:52.340
(Chains clanking)

15:06.789 --> 15:09.157
Must not be feeling too chatty.

15:09.191 --> 15:10.892
Consider it a blessing.

15:10.926 --> 15:13.161
Feeling less than robust?

15:13.195 --> 15:14.796
Good.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.297
(Low growl)

15:17.567 --> 15:20.635
So, do you have a name?

15:20.669 --> 15:23.638
Should I just call you Death?

15:25.674 --> 15:28.810
You may serve Moloch...

15:28.844 --> 15:30.812
and outside these walls
you may be

15:30.846 --> 15:33.415
one of the Four Horsemen
from the Book of Revelation,

15:33.449 --> 15:35.417
but now...

15:35.451 --> 15:38.319
you are nothing but a prisoner.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.790
And I will see you
and your kind defeated.

15:41.824 --> 15:44.325
Just as I took your head.

15:46.228 --> 15:50.165
One way or other,
I will learn your secrets,

15:50.199 --> 15:52.200
and you shall remain here
for eternity...

15:54.303 --> 15:56.805
a failure.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.209
Where'd that come from?

16:04.513 --> 16:06.414
(Crackling)

16:13.589 --> 16:15.790
(Brooks grunting)

16:15.825 --> 16:17.525
ABBIE:
Crane.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.227
(Grunting)

16:20.262 --> 16:22.997
(Crackling)

16:24.900 --> 16:27.168
HORSEMAN'S VOICE:
It belonged...

16:27.203 --> 16:29.437
to Katrina.

16:30.506 --> 16:31.840
HORSEMAN'S VOICE:
Yes,

16:31.874 --> 16:34.542
you took my head,

16:34.577 --> 16:37.579
but death will not be silenced.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.685
ABBIE:
Crane, I know what you're thinking.

16:43.719 --> 16:46.020
You have no idea what I'm thinking.

16:46.055 --> 16:48.756
Look, I'm on your side here.

16:48.791 --> 16:51.326
Brooks warned us that he
would try to get under our skin.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.028
But how does the Horseman
have Katrina's necklace?

16:54.063 --> 16:55.396
Okay,

16:55.431 --> 16:57.265
let's start with what we know.

16:57.299 --> 17:00.068
Why would he have
this exact necklace?

17:02.271 --> 17:04.405
It was a gift to her.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.442
But not from me.

17:07.476 --> 17:10.944
It was given to her by the man
to whom she was once betrothed.

17:10.980 --> 17:12.914
My best friend,

17:12.948 --> 17:15.183
Abraham Van Brunt.

17:15.217 --> 17:18.520
This one, sir,
is sure to melt her heart.

17:18.554 --> 17:23.124
There's no other like
it in the colonies.

17:23.157 --> 17:26.294
I think I rather like it for her.

17:26.328 --> 17:28.096
What do you think, Ichabod?

17:28.130 --> 17:30.064
Yes, it's a...

17:30.099 --> 17:31.232
it's a beautiful piece.

17:31.267 --> 17:32.300
It's the best one.

17:32.334 --> 17:33.468
It's not my place.

17:33.502 --> 17:34.769
Ichabod, this is important.

17:36.305 --> 17:40.174
I'm... I'm not sure it suits Katrina.

17:43.078 --> 17:45.346
This one.

17:48.017 --> 17:49.984
It embodies her elegance,

17:50.019 --> 17:52.453
simplicity, beauty...

17:52.488 --> 17:54.522
and restraint.

17:58.260 --> 18:00.828
(Snaps fingers)
(Sighs): Uh, very well.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.998
I'm trusting you.

18:05.935 --> 18:09.370
(Playing "Greensleeves")

18:19.949 --> 18:21.950
(Song ends)

18:30.826 --> 18:33.027
Turn around, darling.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.369
There... we... go.

18:44.974 --> 18:46.774
It's perfect.

18:46.809 --> 18:48.776
Exactly what I would have chosen.

18:48.811 --> 18:50.578
I knew it would be.

18:51.747 --> 18:54.148
Ah, Rutledge is here,

18:54.183 --> 18:55.683
with news from the Crown.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.285
Word is

18:57.319 --> 18:59.354
they're sending troops
to disrupt Congress.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.156
Mother.

19:02.191 --> 19:03.758
Excuse us.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.966
You picked this out, didn't you?

19:12.001 --> 19:15.069
- Sorry?
- Abraham's taste is far more excessive.

19:15.104 --> 19:18.239
He's not bought
anything of the kind for me.

19:18.273 --> 19:19.674
Perhaps he's learning.

19:20.876 --> 19:23.745
I merely consulted.
Take no offense.

19:29.218 --> 19:31.419
I'm breaking off the engagement.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.056
You can't.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.491
I'm telling Abraham tonight.

19:36.525 --> 19:38.593
Katrina...

19:38.627 --> 19:42.330
I know an arranged marriage is
not the stuff of fairy tales,

19:42.364 --> 19:45.433
but Abraham's from
a good family, and...

19:45.467 --> 19:47.101
he loves you.

19:47.136 --> 19:50.204
I do not love him.
I never have.

19:50.239 --> 19:53.241
My heart belongs to another.

19:56.045 --> 19:58.946
I cannot betray my friend.

19:58.981 --> 20:00.682
This isn't about you,
dear Ichabod.

20:00.716 --> 20:02.183
This is my life.

20:02.217 --> 20:05.920
I am breaking off the engagement
because it isn't right for me.

20:05.954 --> 20:08.523
- There are consequences.
- As there were

20:08.557 --> 20:10.525
when you turned your back
on England, remember?

20:10.559 --> 20:12.694
All of this...

20:12.728 --> 20:15.763
it's the remnants of the life
we are fighting to leave behind.

20:15.798 --> 20:18.633
I do not wish to go
to the effort of creating

20:18.667 --> 20:20.034
an independent country

20:20.069 --> 20:22.036
only to have it dictated
by the same

20:22.071 --> 20:24.472
senseless customs as our motherland.

20:24.506 --> 20:29.410
If and when I marry,
it will be out of love.

20:29.445 --> 20:32.313
Otherwise, I know not
what I'm fighting for.

20:32.347 --> 20:34.482
You deserve nothing less than love.

20:34.516 --> 20:37.251
And I love you, Ichabod.

20:40.923 --> 20:44.759
She dumped her fiancÃ© for you.

20:44.793 --> 20:47.128
Wow. You got some game.

20:47.162 --> 20:51.065
I neither wanted
nor did I invite "game."

20:51.100 --> 20:52.834
The unfortunate situation
was a by-product

20:52.868 --> 20:55.670
of the meager rights
afforded to women at the time.

20:55.704 --> 20:57.004
It's still better to be you.

20:57.039 --> 20:59.073
Be that as it may...

20:59.108 --> 21:03.344
I need to understand
why the Horseman has it.

21:03.378 --> 21:05.813
Did he take it from her?

21:07.483 --> 21:10.918
Does he know why Moloch
holds Katrina captive?

21:10.953 --> 21:13.354
We need to stay on point.

21:13.388 --> 21:14.856
We are looking for his weakness.

21:14.890 --> 21:17.759
Don't let him find yours.

21:17.793 --> 21:20.328
And we shall find it.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.229
We have him talking.

21:35.688 --> 21:39.025
IRVING: That's why no electrical workers
carry firearms.

21:39.059 --> 21:41.127
Wait here.

21:47.467 --> 21:49.035
You're kidding.

21:58.879 --> 22:00.212
(Cocks hammer)

22:00.247 --> 22:02.515
Don't move.

22:05.252 --> 22:07.420
(Grunting)
(Neck cracks)

22:18.532 --> 22:21.434
IRVING:
So much for her waiting.

22:26.873 --> 22:29.308
Put 'em down! Now!

22:29.342 --> 22:30.509
You're way outnumbered.

22:31.945 --> 22:35.147
IRVING:
I'd do exactly as she said.

22:35.182 --> 22:36.182
Two against four?

22:37.017 --> 22:38.150
I like our odds.

22:38.185 --> 22:39.418
Check your math, Adolf.

22:49.029 --> 22:50.529
Put your hands behind your head.

22:58.205 --> 22:59.872
(Chains rattle quietly)

22:59.906 --> 23:02.074
How did you acquire this necklace?

23:03.543 --> 23:06.011
You wish to wear it?

23:06.046 --> 23:08.247
How would that work, exactly?

23:08.281 --> 23:10.015
HORSEMAN'S VOICE:
You miss Katrina.

23:10.050 --> 23:13.552
- CRANE: What do you know about her?
- I know all of her secrets.

23:13.587 --> 23:15.754
Her fate. Her destiny.

23:15.789 --> 23:17.423
Well, tell me.

23:17.457 --> 23:19.592
You want me to know, don't you?

23:19.626 --> 23:21.026
Not yet.

23:21.061 --> 23:24.430
But you will learn...
before you die.

23:24.464 --> 23:26.365
I bested you in battle.

23:26.399 --> 23:28.100
The sunlight has weakened you.

23:28.135 --> 23:30.069
You must use a puppet to speak.

23:30.103 --> 23:32.605
And now you are caged like a beast,

23:32.639 --> 23:34.573
because...

23:34.608 --> 23:37.042
I took your head.

23:37.077 --> 23:42.948
HORSEMAN'S VOICE: I took you!
I took you on the battlefield!

23:42.983 --> 23:47.786
I slayed your Mason brethren!
I hung their heads like lanterns!

23:47.821 --> 23:49.955
I killed her partner!

23:49.990 --> 23:51.991
(Thunder rolling)

23:52.025 --> 23:54.326
And I will kill you.

23:54.361 --> 23:57.229
My, this has become very personal.

23:57.264 --> 23:59.598
Why me?

23:59.633 --> 24:01.467
Your mission was
to massacre the Masons,

24:01.501 --> 24:03.435
yet you lingered.

24:03.470 --> 24:06.472
for your head?

24:06.506 --> 24:07.940
No.

24:07.974 --> 24:10.109
For me.

24:10.143 --> 24:12.811
That was your downfall.

24:12.846 --> 24:15.614
Did Moloch sanction this mission?

24:15.649 --> 24:18.184
Are you on your own?

24:18.218 --> 24:20.920
Something blinded your judgment...

24:20.954 --> 24:23.322
made you careless.

24:23.356 --> 24:26.759
HORSEMAN'S VOICE:
I have waited for this day.

24:26.793 --> 24:29.528
Washington's prize soldier...

24:29.563 --> 24:33.199
all the time you were searching
for me on the battlefield...

24:33.233 --> 24:35.434
(Horse neighs)

24:35.468 --> 24:37.336
I, too, was searching for you.

24:38.705 --> 24:41.774
You were my mission.

24:41.808 --> 24:44.109
(Distorted yelling)

24:44.144 --> 24:45.844
Then and now.

24:45.879 --> 24:47.179
(Distorted growl)

24:47.214 --> 24:50.449
HORSEMAN'S VOICE:
You ask why I remain here.

24:50.483 --> 24:51.717
To finish what I started.

24:51.751 --> 24:54.019
And as you lay dying,

24:54.054 --> 24:57.690
think about all the bloodshed
that will follow,

24:57.724 --> 25:02.361
and know that it will be
on your hands.

25:08.401 --> 25:11.406
Mills, that van is evidence.

25:11.441 --> 25:13.038
Do you know how dangerous this is?

25:13.073 --> 25:15.174
I have an entire TAC team
in position.

25:15.208 --> 25:16.675
That's why I wasn't worried.

25:16.710 --> 25:18.377
The next time I tell you to wait...

25:18.411 --> 25:19.912
This bag is empty.

25:19.946 --> 25:22.448
Whatever was in it
is somewhere else out here now.

25:24.751 --> 25:28.654
Attention, I need the dogs rolling over
the southwest quadrant immediately.

25:28.688 --> 25:31.490
Why were you searching
for me on the battlefield?

25:31.524 --> 25:34.193
HORSEMAN'S VOICE: To avenge
the death of your partner.

25:34.227 --> 25:35.427
My partner?

25:35.462 --> 25:37.496
HORSEMAN'S VOICE:
Abraham.

25:37.530 --> 25:39.398
Have you forgotten about him already?

25:40.934 --> 25:42.534
(Muffled):
Crane.

25:42.569 --> 25:44.036
HORSEMAN'S VOICE:
Does the other Witness know

25:44.070 --> 25:46.171
that you betrayed and killed your

25:46.206 --> 25:48.440
- former partner?
- No. That's lies.

25:48.475 --> 25:49.775
That's not what happened!

25:49.809 --> 25:50.843
Crane, listen to me.

25:50.877 --> 25:52.278
I-I'm not finished, Lieutenant.

25:54.281 --> 25:55.881
Captain.

25:56.883 --> 25:58.884
Found this on the perimeter.

26:02.155 --> 26:04.623
All teams, S&R on Hollow

26:04.658 --> 26:06.959
(Loud explosion)

26:18.638 --> 26:20.072
(Lights buzzing)

26:20.106 --> 26:21.473
U.V. lights.

26:21.508 --> 26:22.641
(Crackling)

26:27.647 --> 26:30.282
BROOKS: I told you this
wasn't gonna end well.

26:32.663 --> 26:34.497
And the captain believes
these same Hessians

26:34.531 --> 26:36.666
are responsible for
stealing this artifact?

26:36.700 --> 26:39.535
We just don't know how many
of these guys there are.

26:39.570 --> 26:42.071
He arrested six at the DWP.

26:42.105 --> 26:43.873
Uh, acronyms.

26:43.907 --> 26:47.043
Department of Water & Power.

26:47.077 --> 26:49.045
And we're still guessing
it's two hours

26:49.079 --> 26:51.714
- until they get the power back on.
- Two hours?

26:54.718 --> 26:57.553
Every minute he grows stronger.

26:57.588 --> 26:59.555
They will attempt
to release the Horseman.

26:59.590 --> 27:03.159
ABBIE: We'll be ready for them.
Irving's on his way.

27:03.193 --> 27:05.661
- I'm going to resume our interrogation.
- Not yet.

27:05.696 --> 27:08.564
Clearly,
he struck a nerve in there.

27:08.599 --> 27:11.100
I didn't kill Abraham.

27:11.134 --> 27:13.970
I believe you, but I need
to know what he's talking about.

27:15.906 --> 27:17.607
Want to fill me in?

27:17.641 --> 27:22.345
Abraham was devastated when
Katrina broke her troth to him.

27:22.379 --> 27:23.913
The next day, the two of us

27:23.947 --> 27:27.016
were charged with an important
clandestine mission,

27:27.050 --> 27:31.754
to deliver the Declaration of Resolves
of the First Continental Congress.

27:31.788 --> 27:34.123
ABBIE: Declaration of Resolves?
Was that a precursor

27:34.157 --> 27:35.558
to the Declaration of Independence?

27:35.592 --> 27:37.760
CRANE:
Indeed.

27:37.794 --> 27:40.429
It outlined our grievances
to the king.

27:40.464 --> 27:44.700
It was a crucial errand
fraught with danger.

27:44.735 --> 27:48.271
But Abraham's mind was elsewhere.

27:49.306 --> 27:50.907
Abraham.

27:50.941 --> 27:53.009
Be cautious...
We're in enemy territory.

27:58.148 --> 27:59.949
She doesn't want to marry me.

27:59.983 --> 28:02.752
- I'm sorry.
- Did I mistreat her, Crane?

28:02.786 --> 28:07.223
Have I not enough wealth to keep her
family in comfort, even luxury?

28:07.257 --> 28:09.392
Social status
she clearly has never had.

28:09.426 --> 28:11.227
CRANE: Katrina's never cared
for those things.

28:11.261 --> 28:14.463
She's spirited.
She's motivated by the heart.

28:14.498 --> 28:15.631
The heart?

28:17.034 --> 28:19.283
She has no right.

28:19.318 --> 28:21.003
Do you realize how
this will make me look?

28:21.038 --> 28:22.972
That I am not good enough for her?

28:23.006 --> 28:25.641
Shh, shh, shh.

28:25.676 --> 28:29.312
I did not know until yesterday,
I swear.

28:30.347 --> 28:33.382
She professed her love... to me.

28:34.618 --> 28:36.786
- To you?
- There's no need

28:36.820 --> 28:38.354
to force an unhappy union,

28:38.388 --> 28:40.756
not when there are many women
who would faint

28:40.791 --> 28:42.325
- at your prospect...
- Do not...

28:42.359 --> 28:43.693
patronize me.

28:43.727 --> 28:45.361
How long have you been wooing her?

28:45.395 --> 28:47.830
Abraham, no, I would not do
our friendship the dishon...

28:47.864 --> 28:49.999
But you have. You have!

28:50.033 --> 28:51.267
Abraham...

28:51.301 --> 28:53.502
you are my friend.

28:53.537 --> 28:56.539
Now, please, you must understand,
this is hard for us all.

28:56.573 --> 28:58.140
We wish for your blessing.

29:01.078 --> 29:02.712
Do not burden yourself.

29:02.746 --> 29:03.779
Abraham, whatever your misgivings,

29:03.814 --> 29:05.214
now is not the time, not here.

29:05.248 --> 29:06.315
Our mission.

29:07.417 --> 29:09.251
ABRAHAM (Grunts):
Lies!

29:11.088 --> 29:13.889
- Draw your sword.
- Abraham, I will not duel.

29:13.924 --> 29:17.360
You don't deem me worthy?
Arm yourself!

29:17.394 --> 29:19.462
(Grunting)

29:22.933 --> 29:26.068
- I yield. I yield.
- I do not accept.

29:26.103 --> 29:27.737
(Swords clash, whoosh)

29:34.344 --> 29:35.611
(Panting)

29:38.248 --> 29:40.516
(Swords clashing, men grunting)

29:51.461 --> 29:53.929
(Grunting continues)

30:01.471 --> 30:03.105
Who's unworthy now?

30:03.140 --> 30:04.240
(Gunshot)

30:04.274 --> 30:05.941
(Grunts)

30:18.922 --> 30:21.590
(Grunting)

30:21.625 --> 30:23.626
(Abraham groaning)
Abraham!

30:23.660 --> 30:26.162
- Oh, no.
- Leave, leave.

30:29.232 --> 30:30.933
(Gunshot)

30:30.967 --> 30:32.535
We must deliver the Declaration.

30:32.569 --> 30:33.969
Leave me!

30:56.827 --> 30:58.561
I never meant to hurt him.

30:58.595 --> 31:02.932
His pride came at a great cost.

31:05.001 --> 31:08.237
The Hessians killed him, not me.

31:08.271 --> 31:09.905
This is exactly what Brooks warned.

31:09.940 --> 31:12.341
He knows your darkest secrets.

31:12.375 --> 31:13.742
And I will learn his.

31:13.777 --> 31:16.312
Not yet.
Not while he's getting stronger.

31:16.346 --> 31:18.180
That's all the more reason...

31:18.215 --> 31:20.516
- For you to sit down.
- I'm making progress.

31:20.550 --> 31:22.852
Now we know why remained
in Sleepy Hollow

31:22.886 --> 31:24.520
- after killing the Masons.
- Yes.

31:24.554 --> 31:26.021
To kill you.

31:26.056 --> 31:27.356
And understanding why

31:27.390 --> 31:29.592
- is key to learning his weakness.
- Crane,

31:29.626 --> 31:31.827
we both know
how interrogations work.

31:31.862 --> 31:33.195
You don't face
your adversary when

31:33.230 --> 31:34.697
you're raw...
That is how you lose control.

31:34.731 --> 31:36.732
I am in control!

31:47.565 --> 31:49.032
(Knocking)

31:49.067 --> 31:53.270
IRVING: (Calls)
Abbie? Crane? It's Irving.

31:58.509 --> 32:01.378
- CRANE: We came as soon as we could.
- ABBIE: We?

32:01.412 --> 32:03.714
We searched all the Hessians.

32:03.748 --> 32:05.949
None of them have
the Thracian Phiale.

32:07.452 --> 32:10.587
ABBIE:
You brought her down?

32:10.621 --> 32:12.723
I'm helping out the captain.

32:12.757 --> 32:16.226
I said tell her about it,
not introduce them.

32:16.260 --> 32:19.463
You understand this
is her first day out. Do I.

32:19.497 --> 32:21.732
CRANE: If none of them
have the Thracian Phiale,

32:21.766 --> 32:23.166
where is it?

32:23.201 --> 32:25.001
We're searching their homes,

32:25.036 --> 32:27.337
properties,
any connection we can think of.

32:27.372 --> 32:28.672
Nothing so far.

32:28.706 --> 32:32.075
ABBIE:
How does this thing work, exactly?

32:32.110 --> 32:33.310
Jenny.

32:34.345 --> 32:36.680
Right. Um...

32:36.714 --> 32:39.683
They'd have to break into the cell
and perform a Druidic incantation.

32:39.717 --> 32:41.318
That will lift the hex,

32:41.352 --> 32:44.821
and all kinds of bad
could get down here with him.

32:44.856 --> 32:46.790
- CRANE: I'm calling for backup.
- No.

32:46.824 --> 32:49.693
ABBIE: She's right. That may be
exactly what the Hessians want.

32:49.727 --> 32:52.195
We already know of one dirty cop.

32:52.230 --> 32:54.264
JENNY: We have no idea who
we can trust... letting anyone

32:54.298 --> 32:56.867
into the tunnels with us
could be the death of us.

32:56.901 --> 32:58.135
I'm afraid they may be right.

32:58.169 --> 33:00.337
This is a secret war.

33:00.371 --> 33:03.206
We must be cautious
whom we invite into it.

33:03.241 --> 33:04.975
Fine.

33:05.009 --> 33:07.878
I'll station an armed TAC team
at every access point.

33:07.912 --> 33:10.180
Nobody's getting down here.

33:10.214 --> 33:13.750
The Horseman's not going anywhere,
Lieutenant.

33:14.819 --> 33:17.654
Not whilst I'm still alive.

33:20.925 --> 33:22.893
IRVING:
All right,

33:22.927 --> 33:25.662
if it's just us down here, we're
gonna need heavier artillery.

33:25.696 --> 33:27.664
I'm not leaving the prisoner unmanned.

33:27.698 --> 33:29.866
IRVING: Then you can stay behind.
Hold the fort.

33:29.901 --> 33:31.635
But you two can help me
carry the weapons.

33:31.669 --> 33:33.637
- Sir...
- CRANE: It's all right.

33:33.671 --> 33:36.072
The cell is still protected by the hex.

33:36.107 --> 33:39.509
I don't like leaving you
with him, Crane.

33:39.544 --> 33:40.744
I see no alternative.

33:40.778 --> 33:43.079
I'm not leaving him alone.

33:43.114 --> 33:45.582
Sooner we leave,
sooner we're back.

33:45.616 --> 33:46.716
We'll stay in the tunnels.

33:46.751 --> 33:48.585
You go to the precinct.
I'll connect

33:48.619 --> 33:50.486
with the TAC team
at the top of the grate.

33:54.092 --> 33:56.092
Godspeed.

33:56.127 --> 33:58.895
Captain.

34:03.568 --> 34:05.068
Crane, I'm staying back here
with you.

34:05.102 --> 34:07.070
I'm fine, Lieutenant.

34:07.104 --> 34:08.839
Thank you.

34:08.873 --> 34:10.440
Just don't lose your cool.

34:10.475 --> 34:12.775
Oh. I shall never...

34:12.810 --> 34:14.543
"lose my cool."

34:14.579 --> 34:17.112
If Brooks gives you any flack,

34:17.148 --> 34:19.315
take his head, too.

34:25.656 --> 34:28.324
(Squelching sounds)

34:40.304 --> 34:43.106
He is damn scary.

34:43.139 --> 34:46.076
Yeah.
And you saw him locked up.

34:46.110 --> 34:49.212
Imagine him on a horse,
pointing an M4 at your ass.

34:49.246 --> 34:50.880
He did that?

34:50.915 --> 34:54.050
I've seen a lot of things
in the last few weeks.

34:54.085 --> 34:57.954
Well, maybe if we do this right,
those things'll stop coming.

35:18.943 --> 35:19.876
(Screech)

35:30.488 --> 35:34.124
(Soft whispering, panting)

35:41.799 --> 35:43.934
(Thumping)

35:43.968 --> 35:46.870
(Whispering, snarling)

35:46.904 --> 35:49.639
(Gunshots)

35:49.674 --> 35:51.041
What the hell was that?

35:51.075 --> 35:52.943
(Whispering, screech)
Jenny!

35:52.977 --> 35:54.644
(Gunshot)

36:00.251 --> 36:02.319
(Whispering, snarling)

36:03.654 --> 36:05.488
(Gunshot)

36:12.997 --> 36:16.666
So, the secret war has begun anew.

36:16.701 --> 36:21.071
You were sent on a mission
to kill the Masons.

36:21.105 --> 36:24.074
You succeeded.

36:24.108 --> 36:27.043
But then you disobeyed
your master

36:27.078 --> 36:30.146
because you had your own mission.

36:30.181 --> 36:33.383
What caused you
to risk eternal imprisonment?

36:33.417 --> 36:36.920
What is your unfinished business
with me?

36:36.954 --> 36:38.755
HORSEMAN'S VOICE:
Now, Ichabod,

36:38.789 --> 36:40.757
you shall learn.

36:43.461 --> 36:44.794
Brooks.

36:46.263 --> 36:47.263
No.

36:49.033 --> 36:50.600
- What have you done?
- (Grunts)

36:50.635 --> 36:52.535
I had no choice!

36:56.140 --> 36:57.474
It wasn't my decision!

36:58.542 --> 36:59.643
(Grunts)

37:02.213 --> 37:04.381
(Grunts)

37:11.889 --> 37:13.423
(Clang)

37:23.167 --> 37:24.567
(Grunts)

37:24.602 --> 37:26.236
(Clanging)

37:27.738 --> 37:30.440
(Grunting)

37:37.119 --> 37:39.114
Abraham.

37:46.660 --> 37:48.861
(Grunts)
How can this be?

37:48.896 --> 37:49.696
Abraham?

37:49.730 --> 37:50.530
(Growling)

37:50.564 --> 37:51.297
This is impossible.

37:51.332 --> 37:52.999
(Grunting)

37:54.902 --> 37:57.770
HORSEMAN'S VOICE:
You watched Abraham die.

38:11.518 --> 38:12.919
That was only the beginning.

38:21.262 --> 38:23.997
Then he came to me.

38:48.389 --> 38:50.790
(Distorted clinking)

39:04.471 --> 39:07.040
(Distorted sizzling)

39:10.979 --> 39:13.351
CRANE:
You made a deal with the Devil.

39:13.447 --> 39:15.648
HORSEMAN'S VOICE:
He gave me what I always wanted.

39:16.647 --> 39:17.880
CRANE:
Revenge.

39:21.689 --> 39:24.857
HORSEMAN'S VOICE:
My prize is not revenge.

39:24.892 --> 39:26.893
It is Katrina.

39:27.928 --> 39:29.729
Katrina?

39:29.763 --> 39:32.131
I believe I know why I am here.

39:32.166 --> 39:34.867
She's held captive...

39:34.902 --> 39:36.803
for you.

39:36.837 --> 39:38.705
HORSEMAN'S VOICE:
Her soul...

39:38.739 --> 39:40.640
will be mine once more.

39:40.674 --> 39:41.941
No.

39:49.416 --> 39:51.451
(Grunting)

39:57.591 --> 39:59.092
Stop! You can't kill him!

39:59.126 --> 40:00.059
The master forbids it!

40:00.094 --> 40:02.261
(Whispering, snarling)

40:02.296 --> 40:03.930
Tell Abbie I'm sorry.

40:06.100 --> 40:08.067
(Panting)

40:22.950 --> 40:26.185
You didn't cause Abraham
to become the Horseman.

40:26.220 --> 40:28.588
Yes, I did.

40:28.622 --> 40:30.790
I violated his honor.

40:30.824 --> 40:34.293
(Groans)
That is so 18th century.

40:34.328 --> 40:35.962
People make their own decisions.

40:35.996 --> 40:38.064
You are not responsible
for his actions.

40:38.098 --> 40:39.632
No?

40:39.666 --> 40:41.968
I was so blinded
by my love for Katrina

40:42.002 --> 40:43.903
I created my own nemesis.

40:43.937 --> 40:46.105
That is your arrogance talking.

40:48.675 --> 40:50.109
What?

40:50.144 --> 40:52.879
I always found Abraham arrogant.

40:52.913 --> 40:55.281
But perhaps...

40:55.315 --> 40:57.784
he was just a mirror to myself.

40:57.818 --> 41:00.253
(Generator whirring)

41:01.688 --> 41:04.157
Hmm.
(Sighs)

41:04.191 --> 41:07.260
Truth be told,
I prefer candlelight.

41:09.296 --> 41:10.830
It sets a certain mood.

41:10.864 --> 41:11.631
(Chuckles)

41:13.167 --> 41:16.569
Bram could've quenched
his desire to kill me,

41:16.603 --> 41:20.673
but Brooks and Moloch's minions
stopped him.

41:22.509 --> 41:25.645
I can't explain why Moloch
spared me from the Horseman.

41:25.679 --> 41:27.980
Other than maybe
you are not his to kill.

41:28.015 --> 41:31.484
If I'm not meant
for the Horseman of Death,

41:31.518 --> 41:33.152
then who?

41:33.187 --> 41:36.689
The Horseman said
that Katrina's soul will be his.

41:36.723 --> 41:38.825
"Will" being the crucial word.

41:40.227 --> 41:42.628
So perhaps...

41:42.663 --> 41:45.364
perhaps she's being held

41:45.399 --> 41:48.167
until he rides
with the other Horsemen.

41:48.202 --> 41:50.236
Thus beginning the end of days.

41:51.705 --> 41:54.373
We're dealing with forces
so beyond our control.

41:55.642 --> 41:58.010
Beyond beyond.

42:01.348 --> 42:03.015
And yet...

42:04.051 --> 42:05.852
Yes?

42:05.886 --> 42:08.654
If Katrina is being held
for the Horseman as his prize

42:08.689 --> 42:11.224
and Abraham was willing to
go rogue and kill you,

42:11.258 --> 42:13.226
sell his soul to... trap her...

42:13.260 --> 42:16.229
Then we've found
the Horseman's weakness.

42:16.263 --> 42:18.865
My wife.

42:22.169 --> 42:23.803
That's the key, Lieutenant.

42:24.956 --> 42:29.806
Now, more than ever...
we need Katrina.
