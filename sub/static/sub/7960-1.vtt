00:29.673 --> 00:31.940
Bit of a hectic morning.

00:33.510 --> 00:36.379
Although, sometimes when,
uh, people are in conflict

00:36.380 --> 00:38.381

Okeydoke.
Let's jump right in, then.

there's some tension

00:48.892 --> 00:50.326

to be insulted.

01:00.170 --> 01:01.270
I came to be vindicated.

01:01.271 --> 01:03.706
So you know what?
I will start.

01:03.707 --> 01:05.840
You know why this
relationship went wrong?

01:05.842 --> 01:07.009
'Cause my supposed best friend

01:07.010 --> 01:09.110
turned his back on me
in my time of need.

Just pecks away at
my self-esteem.

that I'm the problem.

to put all this behind us

01:35.005 --> 01:37.940

and requested a new partner.

01:37.941 --> 01:40.042

you bailed on me as a friend.
