<i>But at least we can make the day start</i>

01:46.791 --> 01:48.083
Oh fuck.

01:48.916 --> 01:49.833
Do you like it?

01:51.625 --> 01:53.083
It's beautiful.

01:53.166 --> 01:54.958
We're having a baby.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.416
I know that it wasn't planned.

02:01.041 --> 02:02.041
Crazy, isn't it?

02:03.125 --> 02:04.791
I will be a dad.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.041
Can you imagine?

02:08.166 --> 02:09.000
Well?

02:09.875 --> 02:10.708
The ring.

02:10.791 --> 02:11.625
Is it okay?

02:13.958 --> 02:15.250
Thanks.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.166
Yes, actually…

02:23.791 --> 02:26.000
Obviously. It's all down to jealousy.

02:27.125 --> 02:27.958
Yes.

02:34.083 --> 02:34.958
Cristina

Are you listening to me?

02:58.875 --> 03:00.833
<i>I just said they're having a baby!</i>

03:00.916 --> 03:02.125
Where are you?

03:02.208 --> 03:04.833
<i>When we were together,</i>
<i>he didn't feel ready.</i>

03:04.916 --> 03:08.625
Five years, four months, 12 days,

03:08.708 --> 03:10.083
and he wasn't ready.

03:10.166 --> 03:11.791
<i>Alright, calm down.</i>

03:11.875 --> 03:14.041
Then he meets a random woman and boom!

03:14.541 --> 03:15.583
Now he's ready.

03:15.666 --> 03:17.583
I know what you're thinking.

03:17.666 --> 03:20.791
<i>You should have seen his face</i>
<i>when he told me, Paola.</i>

03:21.833 --> 03:23.458
His eyes were sparkling.

03:23.958 --> 03:26.666
Darling, you're torturing yourself.

03:26.750 --> 03:29.083
Why did he get another woman pregnant?

03:31.458 --> 03:33.458
And why does he want to marry her?

03:34.250 --> 03:35.250
And me?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.625
How much did you drink?

03:37.708 --> 03:39.458
<i>Why are you whispering?</i>

03:39.541 --> 03:42.375
I can't hear a word you're saying.

03:42.958 --> 03:44.791
Shout, like we used to do.

03:45.791 --> 03:47.041
Let's shout together.

03:50.333 --> 03:54.666
Fuck Carlo and Cristina!

03:57.833 --> 03:59.416
Why are you shouting?

03:59.500 --> 04:01.125
-Oh God.
<i>-Alice?</i>

04:01.208 --> 04:02.208
-Sorry.
<i>-You okay?</i>

04:02.833 --> 04:03.958
So sorry.

04:08.208 --> 04:09.708
I'm going.

04:13.291 --> 04:14.416

04:14.500 --> 04:16.166

04:17.291 --> 04:20.041
<i>Now please</i>,
<i>get in a taxi and go straight home.</i>

04:20.125 --> 04:21.000

04:21.583 --> 04:23.125
-<i>Alice</i>?
-Good night.

04:23.208 --> 04:24.208
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

04:27.791 --> 04:29.875
<i>We must be realistic.</i>

04:29.958 --> 04:31.750
<i>I never want to betray you,</i>

04:31.833 --> 04:35.625

<i>-Your memory won't come back.</i>
<i>-I'm sorry.</i>

04:37.916 --> 04:39.708
<i>I'm a stranger to you.</i>

Fuck!

06:10.833 --> 06:11.958
Wait!

06:13.000 --> 06:13.833
Fuck!

06:17.416 --> 06:18.375
No, wait!

06:19.000 --> 06:19.916
Stop!

06:23.541 --> 06:24.791
To the Dock Studios.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.125
Thanks.

06:46.750 --> 06:47.583
Alice.

06:48.166 --> 06:49.708
You disappeared last night.

06:49.791 --> 06:50.875
Yes, you know,

06:51.416 --> 06:52.833
I'm so sorry.

06:52.916 --> 06:54.125
You missed the best part.

06:54.833 --> 06:56.208
Wow, it's beautiful.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.458
I did text you.

06:59.166 --> 07:00.166
Yeah, you did.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.041
I got your text, thanks.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.916
I'm so happy for you.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.750
Sorry, but…

07:11.833 --> 07:13.583
I need to run, I'm late

07:13.666 --> 07:14.666
for the meeting.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.041
But Alice?

07:16.125 --> 07:17.166
What?

07:17.250 --> 07:18.583
What's with the skirt?

07:19.791 --> 07:22.125
Shit, the newspaper.

07:22.791 --> 07:24.083
Okay.

07:50.916 --> 07:53.000
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

07:55.250 --> 07:56.500
Are you new?

07:57.083 --> 07:59.208
No, I haven't been new for a while.

08:04.000 --> 08:04.875
Goodbye.

08:15.708 --> 08:16.791
They're both cute.

08:17.958 --> 08:20.958
If you're going on air,
I'd change the jacket.

08:21.041 --> 08:23.041
No, I'm not going on air.

08:25.625 --> 08:28.166
You're choosing a skirt,

08:28.916 --> 08:30.708
I assumed you needed it for work.

08:31.375 --> 08:33.625
Yes, I've been working here for a while.

08:34.125 --> 08:35.125
Unlike you.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.416
If you wouldn't mind,

08:38.000 --> 08:38.833
I'm very busy.

08:46.125 --> 08:46.958
Alice?

08:48.750 --> 08:50.833
God, the meeting is in ten minutes.

08:50.916 --> 08:51.916
Calm down, I'm here.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Go get some decent coffee

08:54.083 --> 08:55.666
and some fresh pastries.

08:55.750 --> 08:57.416
-And get napkins.
-All done.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.833
Have you checked the meeting room?

08:59.916 --> 09:02.375
-Bodrato cares about that stuff.
-Going now.

09:02.458 --> 09:03.458
Hurry up.

09:22.083 --> 09:22.916
Hey.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.208
Fuck.

09:26.041 --> 09:26.916
Hey.

09:31.625 --> 09:32.958
Where'd you go last night?

09:33.833 --> 09:37.250
You missed the most important moment
of my entire life.

09:39.833 --> 09:41.791
Sorry, Carlo. I had an emergency.

09:41.875 --> 09:43.250
What kind of emergency?

09:44.916 --> 09:45.750
My mother.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.541
She was ill and I had to rush to hers.
I'm so sorry.

09:49.625 --> 09:51.250
Oh God, is she alright?

09:51.333 --> 09:53.708
-I'll call her.
-No, she's fine.

09:53.791 --> 09:55.000
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.875
-She'd like to hear--
-Of course, but she's fine.

09:57.958 --> 09:58.791
Good morning.

09:58.875 --> 10:00.000
Morning, Loredana.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.000
-Hi.
-Morning.

10:04.625 --> 10:05.541
Good morning.

10:06.250 --> 10:07.666
Don't mind me.

10:07.750 --> 10:08.958
Please, go on.

10:12.166 --> 10:13.083
Hello, my love.

10:13.625 --> 10:15.375
-Good morning.
-Thank you.

10:16.166 --> 10:17.041
Good morning.

10:19.041 --> 10:21.333
-Good morning, guys.
-Good morning.

10:21.416 --> 10:23.458
-Hi, good morning.
-Good morning.

10:23.541 --> 10:24.791
-Morning.
-Please.

10:26.666 --> 10:28.333
Now, that we're all here.

10:28.416 --> 10:29.416
So…

10:30.000 --> 10:33.416
As you all know, I've always thought of us

10:33.500 --> 10:35.041
at Dora TV as a…

10:35.625 --> 10:36.500
as a family.

10:36.583 --> 10:39.208
And in a family, we share everything.

10:39.291 --> 10:41.500
The good and the bad news.

10:41.583 --> 10:43.208
Today we have both.

10:44.166 --> 10:47.458
The good news is
that my fabulous PA, Cristina,

10:47.541 --> 10:50.208
will soon give birth to a mini-Carlo!

10:50.708 --> 10:52.166
-Yes!
-Thanks.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.250
-I'm proud of you.
-Thank you.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.166
<i>If this was the good news…</i>

10:56.250 --> 10:57.083
Thank you.

10:57.166 --> 10:58.750
Let's calm down.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.458
The bad news is that Channel 8

11:05.041 --> 11:08.791
has not recommissioned <i>Wake Up, Turin.</i>

11:08.875 --> 11:10.541
-But--
-Oh God.

11:10.625 --> 11:15.291
Once we have completed
the current block of filming,

11:15.375 --> 11:16.500
production will stop.

11:16.583 --> 11:17.416
No!

11:18.666 --> 11:19.500
However,

11:20.416 --> 11:23.250
I do have further good news.

11:23.333 --> 11:25.750
I have managed to get a slot

11:25.833 --> 11:28.125
for a new show.

11:28.208 --> 11:29.541
What kind of show?

11:30.083 --> 11:31.041
No idea.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.416
You must find one.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.625
But we will not work alone.

11:35.208 --> 11:38.958
I'm happy to introduce you
to our new creative director,

11:39.041 --> 11:40.250
Davide Sardi.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.875
-Here he is.
-Good morning.

11:41.958 --> 11:44.291
He will evaluate your work

11:44.375 --> 11:46.375
and your skills.

11:46.458 --> 11:49.875
He and I together
will be able to make the best choices

11:50.625 --> 11:52.750
for the future of Dora TV.

11:53.583 --> 11:54.791
Great, good luck.

12:04.208 --> 12:06.250
<i>Hired or fired?</i>

12:07.083 --> 12:07.958
<i>Here you are.</i>

12:08.041 --> 12:10.416
<i>The female lead in the new Dora TV show.</i>

12:11.416 --> 12:13.000
<i>Ten years of experience.</i>

12:13.583 --> 12:16.166
<i>A communications and entertainment degree.</i>

12:16.250 --> 12:18.500
<i>A diploma from the Cinema Institute.</i>

12:19.083 --> 12:21.041
And what for?

12:21.125 --> 12:22.000
Mind the germs.

12:28.750 --> 12:29.583
Excuse me?

12:32.250 --> 12:33.750
It's for your own sake.

12:33.833 --> 12:37.625
Public toilets are not the best place
to seek solace.

12:42.458 --> 12:43.291
Well.

12:45.041 --> 12:47.208
After the last 24 hours,

12:48.541 --> 12:50.666
germs really don't seem that bad,

12:51.166 --> 12:52.625
almost tempting.

12:55.458 --> 12:56.375
Bad day?

13:01.125 --> 13:02.375
Incredibly bad.

13:03.166 --> 13:05.250
You're a Libra,

13:05.333 --> 13:06.166
aren't you?

13:06.833 --> 13:08.041
Yes, I am.

13:08.125 --> 13:09.583
I'm a Libra.

13:10.333 --> 13:11.458
How do you know?

13:11.541 --> 13:12.833
Intuition.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.000
And a lot of studying.

13:15.083 --> 13:15.958
Sure.

13:16.541 --> 13:19.666
But I don't believe in that stuff.

13:21.291 --> 13:24.083
To me, astrology is a bunch of crap.

13:28.166 --> 13:29.916
Only if you don't understand.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.166
Well,

13:34.958 --> 13:35.875
you know

13:36.708 --> 13:39.125
I read that for us Libras

13:39.208 --> 13:41.291
this will be a lucky year.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.500
And yet, my heart has been broken

13:44.583 --> 13:46.541
and I could lose my job.

13:48.833 --> 13:51.958
I'd like to meet the guy
who invented astrology.

13:52.041 --> 13:55.333
While other people are having fun,
I'm stuck here.

13:57.333 --> 13:58.250
I'm Tio.

13:59.791 --> 14:00.625
Tio.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.083
My stage name.

14:03.166 --> 14:04.625
Short for Tiziano.

14:05.250 --> 14:08.166
I'm an actor, among other things.
Shooting at this studio.

14:08.666 --> 14:09.500
You?

14:10.666 --> 14:12.458
I'm Alice Bassi.

14:13.041 --> 14:15.875
Assistant producer for Dora TV, next door.

14:17.375 --> 14:18.208
Well,

14:18.750 --> 14:19.583
Alice Bassi.

14:21.291 --> 14:24.375
So many people dismiss astrology, but then

14:25.333 --> 14:26.875
they read their horoscope.

14:28.208 --> 14:29.375
Clearly you do too.

14:34.250 --> 14:35.083
Excuse me.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.291
Didn't the stars tell you
this was the ladies' room?

14:39.375 --> 14:41.125
Still with those definitions.

14:42.791 --> 14:46.625
The world is a lot more fluid
about these things.

14:48.541 --> 14:49.583
And anyway,

14:50.416 --> 14:51.916
you're in the men's room.

15:01.583 --> 15:02.541
Here you are.

15:04.416 --> 15:06.250
Did you just use the men's room?

15:06.333 --> 15:08.166
Of course not. Why would I?

15:09.458 --> 15:10.291
Anyway.

15:10.958 --> 15:12.375
Davide Sardi.

15:12.458 --> 15:13.583
Who the fuck is he?

15:15.666 --> 15:16.583
Another thing.

15:17.666 --> 15:21.583
What did you text Cristina, last night?

15:22.083 --> 15:23.166
What do you mean?

15:23.250 --> 15:25.708
I don't know, she was acting paranoid.

15:25.791 --> 15:28.000
Don't worry we'll meet her for lunch.

15:28.833 --> 15:29.958
You can clear the air.

15:30.041 --> 15:31.000
Lunch?

15:31.541 --> 15:32.958
-The three of us?
-Alice?

15:33.666 --> 15:35.000
Excuse me, Alice.

15:35.666 --> 15:36.958
Will you be long?

15:38.375 --> 15:39.625
I apologize, but…

15:40.250 --> 15:42.958
we were supposed to have a work lunch.

15:43.041 --> 15:44.166
You know how it is.

15:45.666 --> 15:47.333
-Sure.
-Goodbye.

15:47.416 --> 15:48.500
Goodbye.

15:53.625 --> 15:57.291
CONGRATULATIONS, SHAME

15:57.833 --> 15:59.166
I can't catch a break!

15:59.250 --> 16:01.083
Of course, you're a Libra.

16:02.875 --> 16:05.791
I insulted my boss's PA.

16:05.875 --> 16:08.083
Are you saying it's the stars' fault?

16:10.416 --> 16:11.250
Firstly,

16:12.000 --> 16:13.625
you just wrote "shame."

16:14.666 --> 16:16.708
It could mean anything.

16:16.791 --> 16:17.750
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

16:17.833 --> 16:18.958
For example,

16:19.458 --> 16:22.000
"It's a shame
I couldn't celebrate with you."

16:22.083 --> 16:22.958
Secondly,

16:23.625 --> 16:26.416
the planets are
in a challenging configuration

16:26.500 --> 16:27.750
which affects Libras.

16:28.625 --> 16:30.791
You have Saturn in retrograde
for the month.

16:30.875 --> 16:33.375
The Sun has just moved into Aries.

16:33.458 --> 16:36.791
Libras bear the brunt
of a lot of complications

16:36.875 --> 16:39.291
both emotionally, thanks to Venus,

16:39.375 --> 16:40.875
and professionally.

16:42.750 --> 16:45.708
-In short, I can't catch a break.
-Come on.

16:45.791 --> 16:48.666
It's just a phase, okay?

16:49.250 --> 16:50.083
If you say so.

16:50.666 --> 16:51.958
You call it a "phase,"

16:52.041 --> 16:55.166
I call it
the "two unluckiest years of my life."

16:55.250 --> 16:56.583
Blame Saturn's transition.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.791
Saturn is the planet of harshness,

17:02.291 --> 17:04.500
of discipline, of challenges.

17:05.083 --> 17:08.083
The good news is
Saturn has moved into Scorpio.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.416
And because Saturn moves so slowly,

17:10.500 --> 17:13.291
it won't come back
into Libra's orbit for another

17:14.000 --> 17:14.833
30 years.

17:17.041 --> 17:19.166
Shame it didn't move into Aquarius.

17:19.250 --> 17:22.500
That guy who wanted to force you
into a lunch for three?

17:24.666 --> 17:25.500
Carlo.

17:27.041 --> 17:28.125
He's my ex.

17:30.041 --> 17:33.375
Aquarius is the sign
of freedom and spontaneity.

17:33.916 --> 17:35.958
They struggle to settle down.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.125
You want…

17:40.041 --> 17:41.458
a Leo.

17:44.041 --> 17:45.041
A Leo is dominant

17:45.625 --> 17:48.250
but also able to look after his partner.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.416
Or a Sagittarius, so adventurous.

17:54.291 --> 17:55.791
-Or maybe a Scorpio?
-Hold on.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.916
I don't want a Scorpio.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.708
He can deal with Saturn
and his issues on his own.

18:00.791 --> 18:03.000
Let's talk about it in a few years,

18:03.625 --> 18:06.708
once he's passed
the hot potato to some other sign.

18:07.958 --> 18:09.041
Where are you going?

18:09.125 --> 18:10.458
It's late, I gotta go.

18:12.541 --> 18:13.583
I'll pay later.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.250
Let me get this straight,

18:18.333 --> 18:22.958
I'm telling you I could lose my job
and might not be able to pay rent,

18:23.041 --> 18:25.875
and you're telling me
I don't have a room at home?

18:25.958 --> 18:28.291
Darling, Dad and I didn't know.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.416
<i>Well, now you do. So?</i>

18:30.500 --> 18:34.291
So now it's too late,
we've already moved the furniture

18:34.375 --> 18:38.750
and the room is the perfect size
for a painting studio.

18:38.833 --> 18:41.541
You can stay in the guestroom.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.791
<i>I can't believe this, Mom.</i>

18:43.875 --> 18:46.708
When are you coming round
to collect your stuff?

18:46.791 --> 18:50.125
Dad is packing everything up.

18:50.208 --> 18:51.291
Is he now?

18:52.666 --> 18:57.166
It's great that Carlo is
getting married and having a child.

18:57.250 --> 18:58.625
It's fantastic.

18:58.708 --> 19:00.000
How do you know?

19:00.083 --> 19:02.083
<i>He called me earlier.</i>

19:02.166 --> 19:04.416
He was worried about my health.

19:04.500 --> 19:07.208
He's such a sweetheart, as always.

19:07.291 --> 19:10.750
Sorry Mom, I can't hear you. I gotta go.

19:10.833 --> 19:11.666
Bye.

19:12.166 --> 19:13.875
<i>At the end of a day like this,</i>

19:13.958 --> 19:16.541
<i>the only way not to kill yourself is</i>

19:17.166 --> 19:18.958
<i>to have as many Spritzes as you can</i>

19:19.041 --> 19:20.750
<i>together with Paola.</i>

19:22.791 --> 19:27.416
I read somewhere
that Scorpios are amazing in bed.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.375
Yes, but this Tio guy--

19:29.458 --> 19:31.958
Come on, his name is Tio. Enough said.

19:32.750 --> 19:33.750
Forget the name.

19:34.416 --> 19:36.500
He's saying that Carlo,

19:37.041 --> 19:38.666
as an Aquarius,

19:38.750 --> 19:41.583
has a very hard time settling down.

19:42.166 --> 19:43.666
But Cristina is pregnant.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.500
And he proposed.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.958
And we're talking about astrology.

19:51.666 --> 19:53.250
Let's not dwell on the past.

19:53.333 --> 19:54.208
Alright.

19:54.708 --> 19:58.708
Tell me, how do you think
you'll deal with this work situation?

19:58.791 --> 20:01.291
I honestly think this is your big chance.

20:01.375 --> 20:03.916
You didn't see the look
the downsizing guy had.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.083
I mean it!
You've been doing this job for years.

20:07.166 --> 20:09.250
You can do it with your eyes closed.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.750
Enrico doesn't give you any real tasks.

20:11.833 --> 20:13.916
Enrico taught me everything I know.

20:14.000 --> 20:14.875
Of course.

20:14.958 --> 20:18.291
I'm just saying that you've grown now.

20:18.375 --> 20:20.583
It's time to fly the nest.

20:24.333 --> 20:25.666
This thing with Carlo--

20:25.750 --> 20:27.791
-I don't wanna talk about it.
-Alice.

20:27.875 --> 20:31.416
You've been hiding
behind the excuse that you're friends

20:32.500 --> 20:33.666
to avoid moving on.

20:35.666 --> 20:36.791
But I…

20:37.375 --> 20:39.416
It's time to fly away.

20:41.833 --> 20:44.291
Be fabulous and successful.

20:45.875 --> 20:48.541
Show the world what you're made of.

21:17.875 --> 21:19.833
Oh, hello!

21:19.916 --> 21:22.166
-How are you, Paola?
-All good. You?

21:22.250 --> 21:23.666
Fine.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.291
Hi, I'm Luca.

21:25.375 --> 21:26.833
Hi, Alice!

21:26.916 --> 21:29.750
He's a colleague from the newspaper.

21:29.833 --> 21:32.500
This colleague is very surprised to see

21:32.583 --> 21:35.333
that the mom is finally
going out to party again.

21:35.416 --> 21:36.416
It's good to see.

21:37.125 --> 21:38.958
I've been leading her astray.

21:39.541 --> 21:40.416
Is that so?

21:40.500 --> 21:42.041
Well done.

21:42.125 --> 21:44.083
It's important to have a social life.

21:44.166 --> 21:46.416
I gave up everything for my girlfriend.

21:46.500 --> 21:47.458
<i>Damn it.</i>

21:47.541 --> 21:48.583
And in the end, boom!

21:48.666 --> 21:50.791
Anna left me. Why?

21:50.875 --> 21:53.458
-Because she needed space.
-Oh, right.

21:53.541 --> 21:54.916
I've heard that one too.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.250
Now I'm hanging out with friends
I haven't seen in ages.

21:59.333 --> 22:00.416
There they are.

22:03.083 --> 22:05.166
Well, it was a pleasure meeting you.

22:05.250 --> 22:06.875
Hope to see you again soon.

22:06.958 --> 22:07.791
Bye.

22:10.916 --> 22:12.458
-Bye, Paola.
-Bye.

22:15.458 --> 22:16.416
He's cute.

22:17.708 --> 22:18.750
Yes, but…

22:19.916 --> 22:21.666
What sign is he?

22:49.958 --> 22:51.875
<i>You love it</i>

22:51.958 --> 22:54.458
<i>You love it, yeah</i>

22:54.541 --> 22:57.541
<i>You love it, yeah.</i>

23:01.500 --> 23:03.291
<i>You love it</i>

23:37.250 --> 23:39.708
<i>Good morning, you skeptical Libra</i>!

23:40.208 --> 23:42.000
<i>This is your daily horoscope.</i>

23:42.083 --> 23:44.875
<i>You are energetic and fierce.</i>

23:45.625 --> 23:49.250
<i>But you will be tested by some…</i>

23:57.166 --> 23:59.250
It's dangerous to drive distracted.

24:03.333 --> 24:04.166
Yes.

24:04.916 --> 24:05.833
Good morning.

24:05.916 --> 24:08.333
You have a nice singing voice, Ms. Bassi.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.458
Maybe that will be your new career.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.208
<i>You gotta be kidding!</i>

24:20.291 --> 24:22.791
How can the studio not be ready?
Where's Alice?!

24:22.875 --> 24:24.250
-Here.
-Where were you?

24:25.000 --> 24:27.625
Nobody knew
we were recording two episodes.

24:27.708 --> 24:29.791
We were supposed to start 45 minutes ago!

24:30.541 --> 24:32.958
Enrico, you said nothing
about doing two episodes.

24:33.041 --> 24:35.416
Sure, I did! Marlin is in Rome tomorrow!

24:36.041 --> 24:37.875
Okay, give me five minutes.

24:43.625 --> 24:44.541
Let's go.

24:46.041 --> 24:46.958
Let's go.

24:55.583 --> 24:57.250
-Good morning.
-Hi, darling.

24:57.333 --> 25:00.000
-Hello, my dear.
-Morning.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.583
-Good morning.
-Morning.

25:03.166 --> 25:06.000
Everyone's panicking. Just so you know.

25:06.083 --> 25:06.958
I know, Carlo.

25:07.041 --> 25:09.291
Enrico never told me
we were doing two episodes.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.833
-I'm so sorry.
-Excuse me?

25:10.916 --> 25:12.208
-What?
-Some coffee?

25:12.291 --> 25:13.541
Of course. Coming up.

25:13.625 --> 25:14.458
Thank you.

25:15.458 --> 25:18.541
Could I get some water?
The vending machine is broken.

25:18.625 --> 25:19.458
I'm on it.

25:19.958 --> 25:20.791
Sergio.

25:21.583 --> 25:23.916
-Work your magic, please.
-Of course.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.166
-Thanks.
-Ready?

25:32.958 --> 25:33.875
Alice?

25:34.416 --> 25:35.291
Yes.

25:43.416 --> 25:44.250
Thanks.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.208
WAKE UP TURIN

25:49.291 --> 25:50.708
Wake Up, Turin!

25:50.791 --> 25:55.208
<i>Good morning</i>
<i>to all the friends of </i>Wake Up, Turin!

25:55.291 --> 25:57.666
A kiss from your Marlin.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.958
-Move to camera one.
<i>-Good morning.</i>

26:02.041 --> 26:05.625
<i>I can't wait to introduce you</i>
<i>to the day's first guest.</i>

26:05.708 --> 26:07.958
Here he is, waking up.

26:08.041 --> 26:09.708
It's our Paulo.

26:10.500 --> 26:11.375
Paulo?

26:11.458 --> 26:12.500
Do you say Paùlo?

26:12.583 --> 26:13.458
Paulo.

26:13.541 --> 26:15.916
What's the contestant's name?
Is it not Paolo?

26:16.000 --> 26:16.916
Paolo.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.625
-Exactly.
<i>-Guess what.</i>

26:18.708 --> 26:21.416
Did you know that this man

26:21.500 --> 26:27.208
has become famous, we might say,
on an international level.

26:27.291 --> 26:28.666
Can we say that?

26:28.750 --> 26:33.291
Because he's the biggest,
most important collector

26:33.375 --> 26:35.291
of vinyl LPs in the world!

26:37.083 --> 26:39.166
Can you do a close-up on Marlin?

26:39.250 --> 26:42.000
<i>-Do you remember LPs?</i>
-Stay on them.

26:42.083 --> 26:44.416
Those wonderful objects

26:44.500 --> 26:47.166
that would spin around on a gramophone?

26:47.250 --> 26:49.583
What is she talking about?

26:49.666 --> 26:51.166
What is she saying? No!

26:51.750 --> 26:52.708
Stop!

26:55.000 --> 26:56.083
Did they say "stop"?

26:56.166 --> 26:58.125
-Did we stop?
-What's wrong?

26:58.208 --> 27:00.041
Why did we stop rolling?

27:00.125 --> 27:02.291
No wonder they're shutting us down.

27:02.375 --> 27:04.416
Because you're an idiot is why!

27:04.500 --> 27:07.250
-But--
-Let me touch up your make-up.

27:07.333 --> 27:09.583
They never tell me anything. Am I shiny?

27:09.666 --> 27:10.958
A little bit.

27:12.041 --> 27:14.541
I'd better go on set and yell at her.

27:14.625 --> 27:15.958
Stay calm.

27:16.041 --> 27:17.541
What's going on, Enrico?

27:19.416 --> 27:20.625
Please.

27:21.500 --> 27:24.541
Give me a minute, I'll deal with it.

27:24.625 --> 27:26.375
-Good.
-Coming.

27:26.458 --> 27:29.166
Your microphone, Claretti.
It was thrown off.

27:29.250 --> 27:30.166
Hello.

27:31.166 --> 27:33.708
-Hi, my love. This is Alice.
-My dear Marlin.

27:33.791 --> 27:35.958
-Hi, darling.
-What a beautiful blouse.

27:36.041 --> 27:38.833
-Do you like it? I wasn't sure.
-Love it. Listen…

27:38.916 --> 27:40.625
The thing about the gramophones--

27:40.708 --> 27:43.625
Nice idea, isn't it?
It just came to me the other day.

27:43.708 --> 27:45.208
The gramophone--

27:45.291 --> 27:47.583
Yes, it's a beautiful image.

27:47.666 --> 27:52.375
But you see,
LPs were not played on gramophones.

27:53.125 --> 27:54.333
They weren't?

27:54.416 --> 27:55.708
No.

27:55.791 --> 27:56.875
Are you sure?

27:57.500 --> 27:58.541
Odd.

27:58.625 --> 27:59.791
Shall we redo this?

28:00.375 --> 28:01.250
-Sure.
-Let's.

28:01.333 --> 28:04.416
Remember to start with camera two.

28:06.208 --> 28:08.750
-Forget the gramophones?
-Yes, please. You comfy?

28:09.916 --> 28:10.791
You look good.

28:11.291 --> 28:12.375
We're ready.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.166
Okay.

28:14.250 --> 28:15.500
Ready, Claretti?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.375
Wake up, Turin!

28:22.750 --> 28:24.416
It's not even midday.

28:25.500 --> 28:26.458
Okay.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.083
Don't you worry, Carlo.

28:30.166 --> 28:31.333
I sorted it out.

28:37.291 --> 28:38.125
Well done.

28:39.666 --> 28:40.500
Thanks.

28:48.041 --> 28:50.291
<i>Good morning, you skeptical Libra.</i>

28:50.791 --> 28:52.708
<i>This is your daily horoscope.</i>

28:53.375 --> 28:55.875
<i>You are energetic and fierce.</i>

28:55.958 --> 28:59.458
<i>But you will be tested</i>
<i>by some possible clashes</i>

28:59.541 --> 29:02.208
<i>with people who have different ideas.</i>

29:02.291 --> 29:03.791
<i>When it comes to love,</i>

29:04.458 --> 29:05.291
<i>be cautious.</i>

29:06.083 --> 29:10.458
<i>However, you could see</i>
<i>the start of a powerful</i>

29:10.541 --> 29:12.000
<i>yet turbulent affair.</i>

29:12.666 --> 29:14.041
<i>Kisses, Tio.</i>

29:29.333 --> 29:30.458
<i>Hello?</i>

29:30.541 --> 29:31.375
Tio?

29:31.458 --> 29:32.833
<i>-Hi.</i>
-Hi!

29:32.916 --> 29:33.833
Where are you?

29:33.916 --> 29:35.458
<i>In the changing rooms.</i>

29:35.541 --> 29:36.708
We need to talk.

29:38.833 --> 29:40.041
<i>Hello, gorgeous.</i>

29:42.708 --> 29:44.958
<i>I'm Marcus.</i>

29:45.458 --> 29:47.708
Alvarez de la Rosa.

29:48.208 --> 29:51.000
I am Ferdinando Prandi's cousin.

29:51.750 --> 29:54.291
As well as his girlfriend's ex,

29:54.375 --> 29:56.625
we had a passionate

29:57.458 --> 29:58.291
love story.

30:00.125 --> 30:01.541
What about the scar?

30:01.625 --> 30:03.708
Oh yes, the scar.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.375
<i>Olé.</i>

30:12.041 --> 30:13.333
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

30:15.416 --> 30:16.791
Give me five minutes.

30:17.416 --> 30:20.500
I need to take this French poodle
for a trim

30:22.791 --> 30:24.250
Tio, it's incredible.

30:24.750 --> 30:28.208
You guessed <i>almost </i>everything right
about my day.

30:28.291 --> 30:30.875
You got my mood right,

30:32.375 --> 30:34.083
the issues at work.

30:34.166 --> 30:37.916
And you got it all
just from the position of the planets?

30:39.500 --> 30:40.666
That's astrology.

30:41.916 --> 30:42.791
Oh God.

30:42.875 --> 30:43.916
Excuse me.

30:49.291 --> 30:51.000
Oh God.

30:55.458 --> 30:56.666
"Almost" everything?

30:57.500 --> 30:58.458
What did I miss?

30:58.958 --> 31:01.250
The powerful and turbulent love.

31:02.416 --> 31:04.416
No sign of that one.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.625
Well, alright.

31:05.708 --> 31:07.041
Be patient.

31:07.125 --> 31:08.500
The day isn't over yet.

31:15.416 --> 31:17.750
<i>Hi, I'm Luca. Paola's colleague.</i>

31:17.833 --> 31:19.666
<i>We met the other night.</i>

31:19.750 --> 31:23.166
<i>I was just wondering</i>
<i>if you'd like to meet for a drink.</i>

31:26.333 --> 31:27.791
How do you do it?

31:29.750 --> 31:31.166
You're welcome, madame.

31:33.833 --> 31:37.500
And what's the sign
of this powerful and turbulent man?

31:38.458 --> 31:39.333
Aries.

31:39.916 --> 31:40.750
I think.

31:43.208 --> 31:44.083
Aries.

31:44.916 --> 31:45.750
An Aries man

31:46.250 --> 31:47.166
is quite basic.

31:47.916 --> 31:51.583
He can marvel at events such as

31:52.333 --> 31:53.666
the discovery of fire

31:53.750 --> 31:56.250
or the invention of the wheel.

31:56.333 --> 32:01.500
However, he's genetically unable
to appreciate nuance,

32:02.333 --> 32:04.291
such as basic hygiene

32:04.791 --> 32:05.833
or chivalry.

32:06.791 --> 32:10.750
He finds any sign
of sexual promiscuity inappropriate.

32:12.250 --> 32:13.250
Basically,

32:13.333 --> 32:14.291
Tarzan

32:15.208 --> 32:16.791
was definitely an Aries.

32:17.875 --> 32:22.625
Therefore, unless you want
to get your man down from a tree

32:22.708 --> 32:27.083
or take him out for a walk
three times a day to do his business,

32:28.375 --> 32:30.083
then it is better to move on.

32:31.625 --> 32:35.375
Is it possible for a powerful
and turbulent love to develop

32:35.458 --> 32:36.791
between an Aries man

32:37.750 --> 32:38.833
and a Libra woman?

32:41.833 --> 32:42.791
Let's discuss.

32:44.625 --> 32:45.625
So,

32:46.583 --> 32:47.416
first of all,

32:48.416 --> 32:50.791
I need to know whether you like…

32:52.250 --> 32:55.083
Do you know the <i>Australopithecus vulgaris?</i>

32:55.583 --> 32:58.208
The first human being.

32:58.291 --> 32:59.958
Man's first stage of evolution.

33:00.041 --> 33:01.458
You see, with an Aries…

35:17.166 --> 35:22.166
