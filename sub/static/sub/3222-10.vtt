WEBVTT

00:04.521 --> 00:05.920
Ugh!

00:07.090 --> 00:08.250
Leviathans.

00:12.362 --> 00:14.091
Dick is coming.

00:14.331 --> 00:16.356
Like I always say, if you wanna win...

00:16.533 --> 00:19.331
...then you gotta be the shark.
And a shark's gotta eat.

00:19.570 --> 00:20.594
You're bibbing me?

00:22.573 --> 00:23.699
Bobby, what is it?

00:23.907 --> 00:26.569
He's making the doctor eat himself.

00:27.778 --> 00:30.212
- They got him.
- Dean, there are four Leviathans.

00:30.414 --> 00:31.779
We don't know how to kill one.

00:31.949 --> 00:34.918
It'll be a shock when we
walk in through the front door, won't it?

00:37.788 --> 00:40.848
Okay, you sons of bitches.
Let's see what you're up to.

00:45.162 --> 00:46.789
Bobby. Come on.

00:47.831 --> 00:49.230
Go! Go!

00:50.701 --> 00:52.862
Hey, Bobby, your hat.

00:54.538 --> 00:57.063
Oh, God. Bobby. Bobby!

00:57.441 --> 00:58.567
Bobby!

01:08.752 --> 01:11.243
Bobby? Bobby?
Hey, hey, hey. Hold on.

01:11.455 --> 01:13.389
- Sam, is he dead?
- I'm checking.

01:13.590 --> 01:15.490
- Is he dead?
- Just drive, Dean!

01:15.692 --> 01:16.852
- Bobby.
- Talk to me, Sam.

01:17.027 --> 01:20.463
- He's breathing. There's a pulse.
- Keep him upright. Stop the bleeding.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.655
I'm not an idiot, Dean. I know first aid.

01:22.900 --> 01:24.993
- I need the nearest trauma center.
- Hold on.

01:25.202 --> 01:26.829
What's the address?

01:27.838 --> 01:29.465
All right, Bobby, hang in there.

01:42.553 --> 01:43.986
Bobby.

01:44.421 --> 01:46.013
Just hold on.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.567
Well, I guess we found Phil.

02:09.145 --> 02:10.579
Wait a minute.

02:11.448 --> 02:12.745
Something's not right here.

02:13.317 --> 02:15.547
No kidding, Bobby.
There's a corpse in a tree.

02:15.752 --> 02:17.310
Something bad's about to happen.

02:17.487 --> 02:21.321
Yeah, well, danger's kind of on the W-2,
Bobby, that's why we got the guns.

02:32.669 --> 02:35.069
Or something bad's
happened already.

02:41.111 --> 02:42.544
Balls.

02:43.013 --> 02:46.346
- You wanna tell us what's going on?
- What's going on with your head?

02:47.618 --> 02:49.017
I got shot in it.

02:49.219 --> 02:50.243
You what?

02:50.754 --> 02:54.053
- We've been with you all day.
- We would notice if you took a bullet.

02:54.257 --> 02:59.092
I didn't take one here.
I took one out there, in the real world.

03:00.197 --> 03:01.630
- You lost us.
- Look, Bobby...

03:01.798 --> 03:05.234
...you wanna sit down, seriously?
There's something I gotta tell you.

03:06.403 --> 03:08.268
Damn it, I can't get at it.

03:08.505 --> 03:10.405
It's okay, take your time. We're here.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.869
No, no, not "you" you.

03:12.409 --> 03:15.901
Real you. Out...
Out there, in the waking world.

03:17.547 --> 03:20.414
Numbers. Numbers. Where's paper?

03:24.154 --> 03:26.588
I didn't have time before...

03:28.158 --> 03:29.819
...to tell you...

03:30.527 --> 03:33.291
...what they're cooking up.

03:33.930 --> 03:35.158
You need to know.

03:36.933 --> 03:40.528
Well, you just gonna stand there
or hand it over, Bobby?

03:41.171 --> 03:42.297
What the hell?

03:45.175 --> 03:48.076
- Karen.
- You were expecting Farrah Fawcett?

03:48.245 --> 03:49.405
No.

03:49.579 --> 03:51.069
She always calls first.

03:53.850 --> 03:56.284
That's what I said
the first time this happened.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.914
What are you talking about? Gimme.

04:03.694 --> 04:05.252
Oh.

04:11.968 --> 04:13.458
This...

04:14.705 --> 04:17.173
This is just like it was.

04:18.575 --> 04:19.632
You're beautiful.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.777
Quit sweet-talking and come here.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.945
I feel like we haven't talked in ages.

04:27.718 --> 04:29.686
I know just how you feel.

04:30.721 --> 04:34.282
Listen, I have something
I wanna say to you.

04:35.459 --> 04:38.087
No excuses this time, okay?

04:38.595 --> 04:42.087
Just sit, Bobby.

04:47.104 --> 04:49.299
I know what night this is.

04:49.673 --> 04:52.403
- I remember this.
- I've thought about this a lot.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.974
- I really sat with this.
- Really sat with this.

04:56.146 --> 04:57.477
Don't make fun of me.

04:57.681 --> 04:59.148
I wouldn't.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.381
But right now I gotta...

05:04.888 --> 05:07.914
I don't remember a storm coming in
the night this happened.

05:30.046 --> 05:34.346
Mother Mary.
I've got a messed-up fruitcake.

05:34.518 --> 05:36.247
What, Bobby?

05:37.888 --> 05:39.355
Nothing.

05:40.390 --> 05:42.654
I gotta go. I'm sorry, darling.

05:43.226 --> 05:44.250
Bobby, wait.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.257
Don't go.

05:48.265 --> 05:51.701
Number one trick is act like
you know what you're doing, Bobby.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.294
- Rufus?
- What, I can't give you advice now?

05:54.471 --> 05:56.302
All of a sudden, you know everything?

05:56.473 --> 05:59.135
- I can always go wait in the car.
- No, wait.

05:59.309 --> 06:02.073
- I need your help. Bad.
- Yeah, damn straight you do.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.406
No, listen to me, Rufus. I'm gonna die.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.378
That's a realistic view
of the mortality rate on a ghost hunt.

06:08.752 --> 06:11.084
Whoa, Nellie, red light.
All right, baby boy, here we go.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.051
No, Rufus!

06:21.565 --> 06:24.500
Are you coming, Bobby?
We're not getting any younger here.

06:24.734 --> 06:26.224
Coming.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.130
God's gonna punish you.

07:21.658 --> 07:23.751
Hello, Mr. Singer.

07:25.762 --> 07:26.888
Your time's up.

07:33.303 --> 07:35.066
So you're my reaper, huh?

07:36.840 --> 07:40.833
You know, I've heard of you guys
grabbing reapees in broad daylight...

07:41.011 --> 07:43.844
...and in their sleep,
but never heard of a reaper...

07:44.014 --> 07:46.505
...showing up inside a guy's custard.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.810
You're in a coma, genius.
This is what happens.

07:49.986 --> 07:53.786
I climb in your custard
and fish you out.

07:54.925 --> 07:58.156
- Oh, you think you can lose me.
- Gonna try.

07:58.361 --> 08:01.159
I've got places to be, Singer,
don't waste my time.

08:01.364 --> 08:03.093
Might as well, while I got it.

08:05.602 --> 08:09.094
You're prolonging the inevitable.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.173
I can find you anywhere.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.405
Even in this gin-soaked rat maze.

08:22.085 --> 08:25.179
I'm just saying,
look, you can't really compare.

08:25.355 --> 08:28.222
I don't even know you right now.
There's not even a contest.

08:28.425 --> 08:32.087
- It depends on the criteria.
- Survival is the only criteria.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.695
When the crap hits the fan...

08:33.863 --> 08:37.390
...it's not about who has skill.
It's about who's the bigger badass.

08:37.567 --> 08:42.265
Bobby, will you please tell Sam that
Chuck Norris could kick Jet Li's ass.

08:49.346 --> 08:51.576
You grab me a beer
while you're in there?

08:51.748 --> 08:55.775
Bobby? Bobby Singer, you had better be
washed up when you come down.

08:59.656 --> 09:00.714
You're filthy.

09:01.891 --> 09:05.383
What is wrong with you?
It's like you want him to get mad.

09:08.665 --> 09:10.394
Bobby, heads up! Whoo!

09:10.567 --> 09:12.057
Poor thing.

09:12.402 --> 09:15.894
Gets left at the altar, kills herself,
and then gets buried in the crypt.

09:16.106 --> 09:18.734
Now she's going after men
who break their girl's heart.

09:18.908 --> 09:21.001
Poignant, am I wrong?

09:21.177 --> 09:24.112
Why you out of breath?
Did you go for ajog up there, man?

09:24.314 --> 09:25.804
- I need your help.
- Clearly.

09:26.016 --> 09:28.075
- Listen to me.
- I want you to grab a torch.

09:28.251 --> 09:31.482
As soon as I open up her coffin,
showtime's coming pretty quick.

09:31.654 --> 09:35.249
Will you listen to me, you son of a
bitch? There's a reaper coming for me.

09:35.458 --> 09:37.824
There's a damn reaper
coming for all of us, Bobby.

09:39.829 --> 09:43.265
All right, let's put this
damn ghost to bed.

09:43.433 --> 09:45.901
I got plans for Purim.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.205
Page the neurosurgeon.
Tell OR to put electrodes on hold.

09:51.408 --> 09:54.468
Move Trauma 2 to Bed 7
as soon as it's clean.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.639
Gunshot wound, right frontal area,
no exit wound.

09:57.814 --> 10:00.112
Breathing spontaneously.
Respiratory rate 18.

10:00.316 --> 10:04.013
RS-T at 120. BP 90 over 60. GCS 5.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.485
Push 80 grams of mannitol.
Prep for intubation.

10:06.656 --> 10:09.022
- Air entry clear.
- Let's get a central line.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.682
- What's happening?
- Get out.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.021
- Stay out. Stay back.
- That's our uncle.

10:13.229 --> 10:15.197
- What are they doing?
- We need him stable.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.925
- Take the bullet out.
- If we get the swelling down...

10:18.134 --> 10:21.695
...if it's in a place we can get to, if...
if he even lives that long.

10:29.446 --> 10:31.710
Forget it. I gotta keep moving.

10:33.683 --> 10:35.344
Heartbreaker.

10:39.756 --> 10:42.020
- He's in arrhythmia.
- Push 30 more mannitol.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.487
We're losing him.

10:43.660 --> 10:46.561
Bolus him with 500 saline.

10:46.763 --> 10:50.062
- Vitals stable two minutes ago.
- Well, he's crashing now.

10:53.503 --> 10:55.664
I'll break your heart.

11:00.910 --> 11:04.038
Bobby. Come on. You okay?
Say something.

11:05.215 --> 11:06.978
Look out!

11:23.066 --> 11:25.694
Blood pressure 130 over 90.

11:37.914 --> 11:40.382
Okay, Rufus, I need you...

11:40.550 --> 11:42.017
Oh, balls.

11:42.218 --> 11:46.314
This would be the one job
you damn near got yourself killed on.

11:46.723 --> 11:50.523
Well, you're gonna be useful,
even if I have to carry you.

11:52.962 --> 11:56.398
He's, uh, stable for the moment.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.464
Just have to see.

12:23.059 --> 12:26.119
Rufus. Where the hell did you go?

12:28.164 --> 12:30.962
Hey. Yeah, you. You, kid.

12:31.134 --> 12:33.159
What are you making like
a white rabbit...

12:33.336 --> 12:35.634
...all over the place for,
you grubby little...?

12:35.805 --> 12:39.866
Enough with the jump scares, kid.
Who are you running from?

12:42.845 --> 12:45.575
Wait a minute. I know you.

12:47.050 --> 12:49.985
Did you think I was dead? Ha-ha-ha.

12:50.954 --> 12:54.981
Call me, all right?
Don't sit shivah for me yet, Bobby.

12:56.092 --> 12:59.289
Listen, after Bridezilla took you out,
remember what you told me...

12:59.462 --> 13:02.556
...about your near-death experience?
Haven't told you nothing.

13:02.765 --> 13:05.495
But now that you mention it,
I almost crossed over.

13:06.069 --> 13:07.969
- And what did you see?
- What did I see?

13:08.137 --> 13:10.662
What are you so riled up about, Paco?

13:11.608 --> 13:13.803
All right, all right. I saw a hallway...

13:13.977 --> 13:16.969
...uh, plaid carpet, the apartment
building from when I was a kid.

13:17.146 --> 13:19.376
- And?
- And I wanted out. Ha, ha.

13:19.582 --> 13:21.948
I'm not dying on no plaid carpet.
No, thank you.

13:22.118 --> 13:23.142
So, what did you do?

13:23.319 --> 13:25.719
Well, obviously, Bobby,
not being stupid...

13:25.888 --> 13:28.118
...I started looking
for the damn exit door.

13:28.291 --> 13:31.886
I swear that's what they mean about
your life flashing before your eyes.

13:32.128 --> 13:34.688
Every time I opened a door,
there was another chapter.

13:34.931 --> 13:37.729
- The good, the bad, the bloody.
- So how did you get out?

13:37.934 --> 13:40.596
- Found the right door.
- Well, how did you find it?

13:40.770 --> 13:42.101
Oh, simple, I went deep.

13:42.272 --> 13:45.332
- Deep. Like old?
- No, deep like...

13:45.742 --> 13:47.710
...crap you do not want
to think about...

13:48.411 --> 13:51.039
...so you bury it,
you shove other crap over it...

13:51.247 --> 13:54.273
...and you don't go there, ever.

13:54.917 --> 13:59.547
So you're telling me that the way out
was through your worst memory?

13:59.756 --> 14:03.089
- It's an important door, Bobby.
- Okay, this is good.

14:03.293 --> 14:05.284
What the hell are you going on about?

14:05.528 --> 14:09.157
This. I gotta find the right door
to get this to Sam and Dean.

14:10.400 --> 14:14.359
- I'm in a coma, Rufus, right now.
- Ha-ha-ha.

14:14.904 --> 14:18.431
- Get out.
- I got shot in the dunce cap, Rufus.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.906
I'm... I'm dying.

14:21.477 --> 14:23.672
- Are you sure?
- Unfortunately.

14:25.581 --> 14:28.948
I'll be a prima ballerina.
Wait, wait, Bobby. Heh.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.712
Are you trying to tell me
I'm one of your better memories?

14:31.921 --> 14:33.411
Would I make this up?

14:35.758 --> 14:37.692
- Okay. I gotta go.
- What?

14:37.894 --> 14:39.088
- You're coming.
- What?

14:39.262 --> 14:40.593
I need my partner on this.

14:41.764 --> 14:43.322
Please.

14:44.967 --> 14:45.991
All right.

14:46.202 --> 14:49.228
Aim for your worst memory.

14:49.906 --> 14:51.965
Think. Focus.

14:52.175 --> 14:54.302
You got it? The worst, okay?

14:54.477 --> 14:57.241
I got a metric ton of worst.

14:57.580 --> 14:59.571
Just take a shot.

14:59.882 --> 15:03.249
By the way, killer bride,
how come she call you a heartbreaker?

15:03.419 --> 15:06.252
I mean, you a family man
if I ever saw one.

15:07.757 --> 15:09.622
Thanks for narrowing things down.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.302
I can't believe you.

15:22.605 --> 15:23.731
I hate you.

15:26.242 --> 15:29.143
Everything's a lie.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.139
Our whole life...

15:33.015 --> 15:34.505
...our vows...

15:35.318 --> 15:37.047
...everything.

15:37.286 --> 15:39.015
You knew I wanted kids.

15:40.390 --> 15:42.756
Why didn't you just...

15:42.959 --> 15:44.790
...sit me down and say...

15:48.464 --> 15:50.523
I don't understand.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.166
You're a good man.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.565
You'd be a good dad.

16:00.810 --> 16:04.678
What does that even mean,
you break everything you touch?

16:05.581 --> 16:08.209
What kind of excuse is that? Aah!

16:09.185 --> 16:11.710
Just stay away from me!

16:12.522 --> 16:15.980
You broke my heart, Bobby.

16:16.826 --> 16:18.521
You happy?

16:20.496 --> 16:22.794
Just go away!

16:27.804 --> 16:29.738
Just so you know...

16:30.673 --> 16:32.402
...I'm sorry.

16:34.177 --> 16:36.372
I never stopped being sorry.

16:38.314 --> 16:41.715
Bobby, I thought you'd want
a gang of rug rats.

16:45.888 --> 16:47.446
So how long after this...?

16:47.690 --> 16:49.089
Did she get possessed?

16:55.431 --> 16:57.023
Three days.

17:01.437 --> 17:04.838
Biggest regret of my life, this fight.

17:08.109 --> 17:13.742
You'd think it was when
I had to stab her to death, but no.

17:15.852 --> 17:17.752
All through that...

17:18.988 --> 17:21.115
...I was thinking...

17:21.557 --> 17:25.084
...we never got to get past this.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.668
If I'd have known...

17:37.440 --> 17:40.432
...I'd have said
anything she wanted to hear.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.238
Bobby?

17:46.582 --> 17:47.947
Hey.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.479
Try the door.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.586
Now.

18:00.796 --> 18:02.525
Thanks, Rufus.

18:21.984 --> 18:23.451
Balls.

18:25.955 --> 18:29.186
What year is this, '89-ish?

18:29.358 --> 18:33.021
What's it matter? I'm still stuck
in eternal frigging sunshine.

18:33.229 --> 18:35.220
No, I was just thinking, man...

18:35.498 --> 18:38.626
...you look pretty good there.
Must've drank less.

18:38.801 --> 18:41.031
Hey, Bobby, where are we going?

18:41.203 --> 18:42.898
Well, Dean, where's it look like?

18:43.072 --> 18:46.007
Dad says I'm supposed to practice
with the double-barrel.

18:46.175 --> 18:50.077
Well, we're gonna skip the guns today.
Here.

18:51.480 --> 18:55.416
Today you're gonna throw
a ball around...

18:55.585 --> 18:58.850
...just like a regular
snot-nosed little jerk.

19:01.958 --> 19:04.586
You know, for a guy
who'd rather break his wife's heart...

19:04.760 --> 19:06.523
...than give her a baby...

19:06.729 --> 19:09.357
...you make a hell of a nanny.
Shut up, Rufus.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.193
We need another door.

19:17.974 --> 19:19.532
Let's go.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.409
- Seriously, Bobby, how come...?
- Dog with a bone, Rufus.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.376
I really wanna know, man,
why no kids?

19:25.548 --> 19:28.346
It ain't that deep.
Dad was a mean drunk.

19:28.517 --> 19:32.510
I figured I'd be just like him.
And, hey, look, I was right.

19:32.688 --> 19:34.588
No sense passing on the legacy.

19:34.757 --> 19:38.716
Man, you're too hard on yourself.
You're more of a cranky drunk.

19:38.894 --> 19:42.091
You know that whatever you're
trying to avoid with the eye rolls...

19:42.264 --> 19:44.698
...that's where you need to go.
I ain't avoiding nothing.

19:44.867 --> 19:46.801
- Yeah, sure.
- Get off my ass, Rufus.

19:47.003 --> 19:49.471
Hey, Bobby, I'm trying
to help you here, okay?

19:49.639 --> 19:51.732
You wanna get out of here,
or you wanna die?

19:51.941 --> 19:56.002
I'm trying. How am I supposed to know
what I don't want me to know?

20:12.962 --> 20:16.659
Hey, look. The crown prince
decided to drop by for a late bite.

20:16.899 --> 20:19.595
Oh, he... He was just washing up.

20:20.236 --> 20:23.763
So who would like to say grace?

20:23.973 --> 20:27.101
Hell with grace. Pass me the biscuits.

20:39.689 --> 20:41.247
- I'm sorry.
- What's with you?

20:41.457 --> 20:43.755
- I'm sorry.
- You break everything you touch!

20:43.959 --> 20:46.154
Let's just have a nice supper.

20:47.096 --> 20:49.257
- A nice supper?
- Mm-hm.

20:53.102 --> 20:54.330
There's your nice supper.

21:01.811 --> 21:03.574
I get no respect in this house.

21:18.794 --> 21:20.489
What?

21:20.696 --> 21:23.392
You can't tell me that wasn't
gnarly enough to go spelunking in.

21:23.599 --> 21:27.296
That was any given Tuesday night.
Believe me, it was nothing special.

21:27.470 --> 21:29.370
- No, no. You're scared.
- No, I ain't.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.631
I just know we're in the wrong place,
Rufus.

21:31.807 --> 21:32.831
You...

21:35.010 --> 21:38.207
Okay, Bobby, you don't have time.
That sound was not the weather.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.678
We can't keep bopping
through your greatest hits.

21:40.850 --> 21:43.011
That reaper's gonna catch up.

21:43.185 --> 21:45.983
I mean, if there was some way
to stop the damn thing...

21:46.422 --> 21:49.983
But it's a reaper, Bobby.
You're screwed.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.419
- I know what we're gonna do.
- What?

21:54.864 --> 21:56.661
We're gonna stop the damn reaper.

21:56.832 --> 21:58.493
<i>So there's nothing else we can do?</i>

21:58.667 --> 22:01.261
I'm sorry. We have to see
if the swelling goes down.

22:01.437 --> 22:03.928
- How long?
- It's hard to say in cases like this.

22:04.140 --> 22:06.665
He's lasted this long.
That's something, right?

22:06.842 --> 22:08.673
Well, yes.

22:08.844 --> 22:10.675
Listen, the bullet didn't shatter.

22:10.846 --> 22:15.442
Only one hemisphere of his brain was
injured. These are all positive things.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.151
But I don't wanna give you
false hope here.

22:18.721 --> 22:20.518
He's far from out of the woods.

22:20.689 --> 22:23.715
Most of the time, cases like this...

22:24.160 --> 22:25.184
They die.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.959
Right now, it comes down to him.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.525
I'll keep you updated.

22:39.041 --> 22:40.906
Excuse me.

22:41.076 --> 22:43.306
Sorry to interrupt.

22:43.479 --> 22:45.674
Is one of you
Robert Singer's next of kin?

22:48.184 --> 22:50.243
We know this is a stressful time.

22:50.419 --> 22:52.410
Look, no offense,
you can skip the garnish.

22:52.588 --> 22:54.453
- His insurance lapse, or what?
- Ahem.

22:54.623 --> 22:58.423
We're sorry to ask, but, um, did your
uncle ever make his wishes known...

22:58.594 --> 23:01.722
...in regards to organ donation?

23:02.932 --> 23:05.492
Organs are only viable
for a very limited window.

23:05.701 --> 23:06.895
- Viable?
- Uh...

23:07.069 --> 23:10.061
We're just hoping some good can come
of this tragic situ...

23:10.239 --> 23:12.935
Listen to me. I'm gonna say this once.

23:13.108 --> 23:16.839
He's not gonna die. It's one bullet.

23:17.012 --> 23:19.242
He's gonna be fine
because he's always fine.

23:19.415 --> 23:20.473
I apologize.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.913
Why are you talking to me
like he's gonna die? Huh?

23:23.085 --> 23:25.747
I do my job. Do yourjobs.

23:25.921 --> 23:28.116
- Save him.
- They're doing everything they can.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.292
Walk away from me.

23:35.364 --> 23:36.524
Now!

23:42.771 --> 23:44.534
<i>Code gray, hallway north.</i>

23:44.740 --> 23:45.764
<i>Code gray, hallway north.</i>

24:07.563 --> 24:10.054
Dick. I know you're in there.

24:10.266 --> 24:12.860
Come on out, you dick.

24:14.303 --> 24:16.567
What, did you come here
to finish the job?

24:16.772 --> 24:18.740
Yeah? Well, come on.

24:18.908 --> 24:22.366
Right here, right now, out in the open.
You and me, Dick Roman.

24:23.812 --> 24:27.680
See? Deciding to jump a famous guy
ain't all upside.

24:27.850 --> 24:31.411
You can kill me right now,
you wanna see it online.

24:32.788 --> 24:34.881
You should go check
on that friend of yours.

24:35.057 --> 24:38.584
He can't be feeling too frisky
right about now. I'm a very good shot.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.524
We're coming for you.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.426
And not just to hurt you, to kill you.
You understand me?

24:47.603 --> 24:49.195
Come on, Dean. I can't be killed.

24:49.371 --> 24:51.896
- You're gonna wish you could, then.
- Ha-ha-ha.

24:52.107 --> 24:53.597
That's some conviction.

24:53.809 --> 24:56.209
You'd really crush it
on the motivational circuit.

24:56.378 --> 24:59.905
You're either laughing because
you're scared or because you're stupid.

25:01.116 --> 25:03.880
I'll see you soon, Dick.

25:15.531 --> 25:18.022
It's in an old King James Bible.

25:22.471 --> 25:25.736
So, what exactly
are we doing now, Bobby?

25:30.879 --> 25:33.609
Well, technically, you're correct.

25:33.882 --> 25:36.544
You can't stop a reaper,
not permanently.

25:36.719 --> 25:40.086
Only their boss can do that,
and we don't want him involved.

25:41.757 --> 25:43.588
Ah.

25:43.759 --> 25:46.353
Now we're cooking with gas.

25:50.432 --> 25:51.922
What is that?

25:52.101 --> 25:56.162
Well, Sam and Dean have run up against
these suckers a couple three times.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.071
Picked up a few tricks.

25:58.574 --> 26:01.634
Enough to slow them down a hair,
at least.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.438
All right. Let's work some mojo.

26:28.504 --> 26:31.598
- What'd that guy want?
- Nothing. Just some insurance mook.

26:33.042 --> 26:34.373
Dick Roman was out there.

26:34.543 --> 26:36.511
What? What happened?

26:36.678 --> 26:41.706
Nothing. For now.
It was just a frigging staring contest.

26:41.917 --> 26:44.511
That was about it. What's the update?

26:47.823 --> 26:50.621
Swelling's down a little.
Um, they took him off sedation.

26:50.793 --> 26:53.353
He started fighting his tubes
so they pulled them out.

26:53.529 --> 26:54.928
He's breathing on his own.

26:55.464 --> 26:57.227
That's good, right? Is that good?

26:57.433 --> 27:00.994
Yeah.
Well, doctor said best-case scenario.

27:01.170 --> 27:03.866
All right, so when are they gonna
take the bullet out?

27:04.640 --> 27:08.872
Dean, they're not even...
They're not even gonna try that, not yet.

27:09.845 --> 27:11.210
What does that mean?

27:11.380 --> 27:13.041
The word's "abrading," I think.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.649
- English.
- Cutting out the dead brain tissue.

27:17.352 --> 27:20.412
That's if the doctor even thinks
it's worth the risk.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.658
Can I talk to you?

27:30.265 --> 27:33.701
What? Talk about what?

27:35.404 --> 27:36.462
You know what.

27:38.707 --> 27:41.198
- Not gonna have that conversation.
- We need to.

27:41.376 --> 27:42.604
- He's not gonna die.
- He might.

27:42.778 --> 27:44.211
- Sam.
- Dean, listen.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.507
- We need to brace ourselves.
- Why?

27:46.682 --> 27:48.673
Because it's real.

27:50.385 --> 27:51.784
What do you wanna do?

27:51.987 --> 27:56.185
You wanna hug and say
we made it through it when Dad died?

27:57.126 --> 27:59.253
We've been through enough.

28:47.109 --> 28:50.169
We still need gold ore,
hemlock and mace.

28:50.345 --> 28:52.779
Hmm. So pretty basic, then, huh?

29:02.191 --> 29:04.022
No, we didn't shoot rifles.

29:04.193 --> 29:06.821
As a matter of fact,
we threw a ball around.

29:08.931 --> 29:13.163
He's a kid, John.
They both are. They're entitled.

29:14.870 --> 29:17.862
Yeah, I know I ain't their dad.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.344
What the hell?

30:03.652 --> 30:05.415
Cute.

30:06.255 --> 30:11.488
Gotta admit, first time anyone's pulled
one on me while actually unconscious.

30:11.994 --> 30:13.859
Well, get comfy.

30:14.029 --> 30:15.155
Not so fast.

30:15.664 --> 30:18.861
Yeah? Sorry. Other business.

30:19.034 --> 30:21.696
I'm trying to help you, Bobby.

30:21.870 --> 30:25.397
You're going to die. Think you can
stop it by pinning me like a bug?

30:28.043 --> 30:30.409
- Well...
- You've seen the dark coming.

30:31.546 --> 30:35.642
People disappearing,
things going blank.

30:36.218 --> 30:37.515
Look around.

30:41.056 --> 30:46.756
Cell by cell,
that bullet's killing your brain.

30:46.928 --> 30:49.089
You're running out of places to hide.

30:49.264 --> 30:52.791
So understand,
this trap won't hold forever...

30:52.968 --> 30:59.066
...because this room won't hold,
because you are going to die.

30:59.775 --> 31:01.072
You think.

31:04.746 --> 31:08.477
Come with me. Be done.

31:09.251 --> 31:10.548
You've earned it.

31:14.189 --> 31:16.953
Or fight me, stay here...

31:19.094 --> 31:20.425
...and you know the drill.

31:23.765 --> 31:25.699
I don't know, Bobby.

31:26.568 --> 31:30.504
I mean, you really wanna get stuck,
turn into some ghost?

31:30.706 --> 31:32.105
I know what I'm doing, Rufus.

31:32.274 --> 31:34.742
Yeah, you're thinking
you can help those boys.

31:34.910 --> 31:37.310
But how many spirits you meet
in their right mind?

31:38.714 --> 31:41.478
- Some hunter's gonna cut you down.
- Whose side are you on?

31:41.650 --> 31:43.015
Bobby.

31:43.919 --> 31:45.079
You've helped.

31:46.588 --> 31:49.489
You got handed a small,
unremarkable life...

31:49.658 --> 31:51.990
...and you did something with it.

31:52.160 --> 31:57.757
<i>Most men like you die of liver disease,
watching Barney Miller reruns.</i>

31:59.000 --> 32:03.096
You've done enough. Believe me.

32:05.006 --> 32:07.031
- I don't care.
- Why?

32:07.242 --> 32:09.176
Because they're my boys.

32:15.050 --> 32:16.677
All right.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.945
The only way out is through.

32:23.358 --> 32:24.848
So lead the way.

32:26.461 --> 32:28.122
Nice seeing you again, old friend.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.764
Thanks for the chat.

32:39.474 --> 32:42.773
It's fine. It'll just take a second.

32:45.981 --> 32:48.313
You just gonna sit there?

32:49.017 --> 32:51.508
Get a broom or something.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.385
You know why he's like that?

32:58.660 --> 33:00.594
Because you let him do
whatever he wants.

33:00.796 --> 33:02.730
It's okay. See? I'm almost done.

33:02.898 --> 33:05.298
You just relax and have another drink.

33:08.003 --> 33:09.937
Don't tell me what to do.

33:11.006 --> 33:14.100
No. Wait. Wait.

33:14.309 --> 33:16.174
Hey... No!

33:19.181 --> 33:21.513
Why do you always provoke him?

33:21.683 --> 33:25.551
Because he's a bad kid, that's why.

33:27.722 --> 33:29.622
Well, that's a load of crap.

33:30.559 --> 33:33.084
- Who the hell were you to say?
- I'm your father.

33:34.529 --> 33:36.053
You show your father respect.

33:36.231 --> 33:40.531
The day he deserves it, you drunken
bully. Punching women and kids...

33:40.702 --> 33:43.136
...is that what they called fatherhood
in your day?

33:43.338 --> 33:44.600
Oh, you deserved it.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.367
Believe me,
you were nothing but ungrateful.

33:47.542 --> 33:49.533
I was a kid!

33:49.711 --> 33:51.406
Kids ain't supposed to be grateful.

33:51.580 --> 33:55.573
They're supposed to eat your food
and break your heart, you selfish dick.

33:56.785 --> 34:00.277
You died, and I was still so afraid
I'd turn into you...

34:00.455 --> 34:02.650
...I never even had kids of my own.
Good.

34:04.226 --> 34:05.716
You break everything you touch.

34:06.628 --> 34:08.322
Uh-huh.

34:08.496 --> 34:10.623
Well, as fate would have it...

34:10.799 --> 34:15.327
...I adopted two boys,
and they grew up great.

34:15.504 --> 34:18.063
They grew up heroes.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.833
So you can go to hell!

34:21.009 --> 34:23.000
Keep the head of the bed up
for transport.

34:23.178 --> 34:25.146
IV can run off the pump.
Just run a TKVO.

34:25.313 --> 34:28.248
- We'll have to wait for respiratory.
- Wait. What's happening?

34:28.416 --> 34:31.612
He's showing signs of responsiveness.
We're taking him for surgery.

34:31.786 --> 34:34.118
If you wanna see him,
I'd squeeze in there quick.

34:36.891 --> 34:40.293
I'm sorry. I said that I'm... I'm sorry.

34:40.462 --> 34:43.260
- Yeah, yeah, you say that every time.
- Please, just stop.

34:43.431 --> 34:45.763
- No! This time, you listen!
- Stop it.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.440
You're kidding, right?

34:58.146 --> 35:00.307
You're not half enough man
to use that thing.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.784
You leave the adults to sort this out.

35:05.020 --> 35:07.545
And I will deal with you later.

35:07.722 --> 35:10.054
Aah, aah! Bobby, go. Do what he says.

35:10.225 --> 35:12.318
- Just go.
- No. Leave her alone.

35:28.510 --> 35:30.705
Bobby, what did you do?

35:32.747 --> 35:34.874
God is gonna punish you.

35:36.484 --> 35:37.883
Hey.

35:40.188 --> 35:41.712
You did what you had to do.

35:43.892 --> 35:45.860
This is where you learn that...

35:46.027 --> 35:48.825
...they pretty much never say thanks
when you save them.

35:52.500 --> 35:53.990
Now go get a shovel.

35:54.169 --> 35:56.364
Bury the old man
out behind the woodshed.

36:00.909 --> 36:05.972
You got the only genetic case
of bullet-in-the-brain I've ever seen.

36:08.617 --> 36:10.084
Not so fast, Singer.

36:21.496 --> 36:23.396
Sorry. We need to get moving.

36:24.299 --> 36:26.096
Right. Yeah.

36:27.869 --> 36:29.359
Hey, um...

36:30.705 --> 36:33.037
Bobby, um, hey.

36:34.376 --> 36:36.708
Just... Thanks.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.006
For everything.

36:44.052 --> 36:45.246
All right?

36:45.420 --> 36:47.547
- Please step back.
- Yeah.

36:50.158 --> 36:53.218
Wait, wait, wait, stop.
His eyes are open.

36:53.395 --> 36:54.487
- Bobby?
- Hey.

37:02.971 --> 37:06.668
Don't talk. Don't talk. A pen. L...

37:07.242 --> 37:08.834
Here, here, here.

37:09.044 --> 37:10.636
What is it?

37:36.171 --> 37:37.570
Idiots.

37:46.614 --> 37:49.606
Bobby? Hey!

38:03.398 --> 38:04.990
Call a code, trauma room.

38:45.173 --> 38:47.073
You microbrewing in there, or what?

38:47.242 --> 38:50.541
Come on, we got a lot of Chuck Norris
to get through. Let's go.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.520
Nice move, waking up like that.

39:01.456 --> 39:03.185
Motivation's a mother.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.852
You know why it's dark out there,
don't you?

39:08.663 --> 39:12.759
This house, it's your last island.

39:12.967 --> 39:15.595
Everything else melted by that bullet.

39:16.671 --> 39:18.605
Gone.

39:19.107 --> 39:23.373
This is your last chance
to come with me and move on.

39:24.679 --> 39:27.307
For your own good, Bobby...

39:27.949 --> 39:29.211
...let go.

39:33.488 --> 39:35.388
They'll be okay without you.

39:42.197 --> 39:43.892
Last memory, huh?

39:48.837 --> 39:51.635
Glad I saved the best for last.

39:55.844 --> 39:58.108
Scoot, jerkface.
Show your elders some respect.

39:58.279 --> 40:00.509
You scoot, asshat.

40:07.088 --> 40:08.988
Did we get licorice?

40:09.157 --> 40:12.615
No, we did not get licorice. We got
good snacks. Licorice is disgusting.

40:12.794 --> 40:14.921
I'm sorry.
I didn't quite understand that...

40:15.096 --> 40:17.155
...uh, Mr. Peanut-Butter-
and-Banana-Sandwiches?

40:17.332 --> 40:20.961
I stand by that sandwich.
Nobody likes licorice. It's made of dirt.

40:21.135 --> 40:24.104
It is a classic movie food.
It's right up there with popcorn.

40:24.272 --> 40:26.263
- Popcorn? You're out of your mind.
- Yes.

40:26.441 --> 40:28.602
What? It's like little chewy pieces
of heaven.

40:28.776 --> 40:30.641
Chewy pieces of heaven if you're a girl.

40:35.817 --> 40:37.216
Well, Bobby?

40:39.254 --> 40:42.485
Stay or go, what's it gonna be?
