the west wing.

17:55.909 --> 17:56.991
Yes, I am.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.077
The west wing begins here.
- Yes.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.581
- This is my boudoir.
- Oh!

18:03.583 --> 18:05.383

glam area and then closet.

the pandemic ends tomorrow.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.290
- It's not.
That's the whole point.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.791
At this point,
I think jamal

19:20.793 --> 19:21.826
is actually
living in the phone

19:21.828 --> 19:24.245
because I am not seeing
this brother.

19:24.247 --> 19:26.931
And with you not bein'
up close and personal,

19:26.933 --> 19:28.466

fall apart.

19:28.468 --> 19:31.502
Intimacy is obviously
not there,

19:31.504 --> 19:33.671

the root of relationship

19:33.673 --> 19:36.140

be in my life?

- But should we
be in something

right now?

19:46.436 --> 19:48.269
I don't think so.

19:48.271 --> 19:50.938
- I believe it's possible
that gizelle and jamal

19:50.940 --> 19:55.743
realized in the pandemic
that the time they spent apart,

19:55.745 --> 19:58.613
they were okay with it,
but I didn't feel like

19:58.615 --> 20:02.867
they were that deeply,
madly in love

20:02.869 --> 20:04.802

we're together.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.543
- I mean, am I the only one?
- No.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.545
- In my opinion,
the relationship was kind of

20:14.547 --> 20:17.348
just still in
its rebuilding stage.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.350
- At this point in time in life,
I need somebody

who lives eight miles away.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.688

from candiace?

41:29.471 --> 41:31.704
- Hi, candiace.

41:31.706 --> 41:32.872
- Coming up next...

41:32.874 --> 41:33.907
- What you're not
going to do...

41:33.909 --> 41:34.991
- Mm-hmm.
- Is you're not going to

41:34.993 --> 41:36.409
come for me 'cause we're
not coming for you.

41:36.411 --> 41:38.745
- I wasn't coming for you.
- I'm not done.

41:38.747 --> 41:40.914
- Oh!

41:43.434 --> 41:46.603
[doorbell rings]

41:46.605 --> 41:50.590
- ugh.
- It's gonna be okay, dear.

41:50.592 --> 41:52.575
- Hello.
- Hi, ray!

41:52.577 --> 41:55.945
- There she is!
- Hi-- oh, my goodness.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.931
- How you doin'?

41:57.933 --> 42:01.334
- Hi, candiace.

42:01.336 --> 42:03.453
Good to see you.
- Good to see you, karen.

42:03.455 --> 42:04.637
I'm freezing.

42:04.639 --> 42:06.673
- Okay, what do
you wanna do?

42:06.675 --> 42:07.790
- I'm in the house now.
I just need to, like--

42:07.792 --> 42:09.008
- I want you to
have a good time.

42:09.010 --> 42:10.093
- Thank you.

42:10.095 --> 42:11.077
- This is not
the place to do it.

42:11.079 --> 42:11.794
- No, I don't want to.

42:11.796 --> 42:13.046
- But what I want to do,
is this.

42:13.048 --> 42:14.264
Maybe next week,
coffee or tea,

42:14.266 --> 42:15.598
somethin' light
and have a discussion?

42:15.600 --> 42:20.419
- Yeah, I would love for
you to see the new house.

42:20.421 --> 42:22.355
- Am I being invited?
- Yeah, yeah.

42:22.357 --> 42:24.257
Oh, stop.
- Absolutely.

42:24.259 --> 42:26.926
Oh, my god, yes.
I will be over.

42:26.928 --> 42:29.479
- I don't have the energy
to do the, you know,

42:29.481 --> 42:30.597
the back and forth
with karen.

42:30.599 --> 42:34.033
So, I'm dragging
some baggage with me,

42:34.035 --> 42:35.568
but I'm here,
and I wanna be intentional

42:35.570 --> 42:37.287
because I came.

42:37.289 --> 42:38.371
- You can say hello
to everybody here.

42:38.373 --> 42:40.273
- Hi.

42:40.275 --> 42:41.407
- Hi.
- Hello, how are you?

42:41.409 --> 42:42.792
- Don't get up.
- Nice to see you.

42:42.794 --> 42:44.110
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

42:44.112 --> 42:45.211
- Yeah.
- Hi.

42:45.213 --> 42:47.380
- Come on.
- Come on new booty.

42:47.382 --> 42:52.051
Can I just-- yes.
It's very firm.

42:52.053 --> 42:53.453
- I got
my money's worth.

42:53.455 --> 42:54.671
- So, you must
be candiace.

42:54.673 --> 42:56.222
- Yes, mia?
- Nice to meet you.

42:56.224 --> 42:57.857
Yes, I'm mia.
- Hi, mia.

42:57.859 --> 42:59.842
- Hi, gorgeous.
- Nice to meet you.

42:59.844 --> 43:00.994
This is
my husband, chris.

43:00.996 --> 43:01.928
- Chris-- nice to meet you.
- Mia.

43:01.930 --> 43:03.930
- Pleasure.
- You must be mia's husband.

43:03.932 --> 43:04.897
- Well, g.
- Yes, I am.

43:04.899 --> 43:06.015
- I was gettin'
that heartburn.

43:06.017 --> 43:08.334
He can come
anytime now.

43:08.336 --> 43:10.153
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.

43:10.155 --> 43:11.971
- Aww.
- But it's so painful.

43:11.973 --> 43:14.240
- For me, I haven't
given a vaginal birth.

43:14.242 --> 43:16.242
I've had all
scheduled caesareans.

43:16.244 --> 43:17.493
- Because you--
how old are you?

43:17.495 --> 43:19.979
- Well, I had to go back
and look at my I.D.

43:19.981 --> 43:21.030
I'm 36.
- Okay.

43:21.032 --> 43:24.017
- So, okay, but you said
you had a clitoralplasty.

43:24.019 --> 43:24.817
- I did.

43:24.819 --> 43:25.835
- That's what
I thought it was.

43:25.837 --> 43:27.337
I thought, you know,
like, the babies came out

43:27.339 --> 43:29.038
and had, like,
really done a number.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.556
- Most women do that
because of havin' a baby.

43:30.558 --> 43:32.258
- Yeah.
- I did that because

43:32.260 --> 43:33.626
I just, you know,
we get in it

43:33.628 --> 43:36.429
a little bit
too much, so...

43:36.431 --> 43:37.730
- Say what, now?
You say what, now?

43:37.732 --> 43:40.383
- Wait, so the bean
is gettin' beat up?

43:40.385 --> 43:41.667
- That's what
it sounds like.

43:41.669 --> 43:43.436
Oh, my god.

43:43.438 --> 43:46.172
- I've known mia for
five seconds, honey,

43:46.174 --> 43:49.375
and we're learnin' about
her busted-ass bean already.

43:49.377 --> 43:50.943
She sounds like
a party to me.

43:50.945 --> 43:53.730
Mia is fabulous.
- You're fabulous.

43:53.732 --> 43:55.682
I was hopin' I was gonna
meet you the other day

43:55.684 --> 43:57.216
at wendy's.
- Yes.

43:57.218 --> 43:59.619
Well, I-I heard that
there was a scuffle

43:59.621 --> 44:03.189
amongst the saints.

44:03.191 --> 44:04.957
- This party is not about
what happened between

44:04.959 --> 44:08.244
gizelle and I,
and so today is about

44:08.246 --> 44:09.412
love and moving on.
- Love and moving on.

44:09.414 --> 44:10.797
- For me, this is my life.
I've moved on already.

44:10.799 --> 44:12.465
- I mean, you're a real boss.
So, I think that that--

44:12.467 --> 44:14.050
- but, mia, you were
the one talkin' about

44:14.052 --> 44:16.436
how gizelle
has this great character

44:16.438 --> 44:17.403
and all of this stuff.

44:17.405 --> 44:18.671
- And I'm just
meeting gizelle,

44:18.673 --> 44:20.223
and I'm a good
judge of character,

44:20.225 --> 44:21.474
and she has
a beautiful heart.

44:21.476 --> 44:23.609
- And now, you're saying
that she's a real boss.

44:23.611 --> 44:25.061
It seems like
your tone is changing.

44:25.063 --> 44:26.396
- So, karen said that,

44:26.398 --> 44:28.881
"mia, if-if
you guys mish, mish.

44:28.883 --> 44:30.249
"if you guys don't mish,
then don't mish."

44:30.251 --> 44:31.217
- yes.

44:31.219 --> 44:32.185
- "but don't-don't mish
on accounts of me."

44:32.187 --> 44:33.319
- for sure.

44:33.321 --> 44:36.239
- So, I wasn't not mishing
with her, but, you know,

44:36.241 --> 44:38.891
any time you'd wish death
on someone's husband,

44:38.893 --> 44:40.410
I have to reevaluate
whether or not

44:40.412 --> 44:41.861
gizelle has
a good character.

44:43.598 --> 44:44.997
- We got deer
all year around.

44:44.999 --> 44:47.116
It was 12 of 'em
right there.

44:47.118 --> 44:48.368
- Twelve?
- Wait a minute.

44:48.370 --> 44:50.236
Who wished death
on someone?

44:50.238 --> 44:52.305
- Ray said, "gizelle,
you're a beautiful woman,

44:52.307 --> 44:54.757
"but, you know, that's not
gonna last forever."

44:54.759 --> 44:56.292
and she said,
"well, you'll be dead

44:56.294 --> 44:57.760
"before that happens,"

44:57.762 --> 44:58.795
or something
like that.

44:58.797 --> 44:59.912
- That's not okay.

44:59.914 --> 45:01.264
- Now, it's-- that's not
cool 'cause you don't wish--

45:01.266 --> 45:02.098
- so, you don't
think gizelle has

45:02.100 --> 45:03.182
a good
character anymore.

45:03.184 --> 45:04.767
- I didn't have that
dialogue before I said that.

45:04.769 --> 45:06.803
- Now, you don't think
her character is good.

45:06.805 --> 45:08.087
- Now, it's questionable.

45:08.089 --> 45:09.605
Are you really that
type of person?

45:09.607 --> 45:11.190
Like, okay, so, you're
just a pretty face.

45:11.192 --> 45:13.526
- But you also asked for
her number after that.

45:13.528 --> 45:14.861
- Should I give you
my phone numbers?

45:14.863 --> 45:16.729
- Yes, yes, yes.

45:16.731 --> 45:18.815
- Well, what I was trying
was to do was enlighten

45:18.817 --> 45:20.483
the air, which is probably
something you should

45:20.485 --> 45:22.952
have done 'cause it was
your home, but you didn't.

45:22.954 --> 45:24.120
- I did that, sweetie.

45:24.122 --> 45:25.104
- But here-here
was my thing.

45:25.106 --> 45:26.489
If my friend were in
that situation--

45:26.491 --> 45:27.573
- mm-hmm.

45:27.575 --> 45:28.941
- I would just be, like,
giving her the benefit of

45:28.943 --> 45:30.343
the doubt more so than
the other person.

45:30.345 --> 45:31.477
- Than somebody I just
met ten seconds ago.

45:31.479 --> 45:32.962
- It doesn't matter
who the person--

45:32.964 --> 45:34.013
- why do y'all
have a issue

45:34.015 --> 45:34.964
when she doesn't
have a problem?

45:34.966 --> 45:35.998
- We got you.
We got you.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.283
If you stop talking,
you will understand

45:37.285 --> 45:38.801
and listen.
- Oh!

45:38.803 --> 45:40.286
- What we're gonna be,
is nice in here.

45:40.288 --> 45:42.722
- Okay, I'm done
talkin' to her.

45:42.724 --> 45:44.957
That was it for me.

45:44.959 --> 45:46.058
- No.
- Press the reset button.

45:46.060 --> 45:47.727
- So, what you're
not going to do,

45:47.729 --> 45:48.511
especially since
I don't know know you--

45:48.513 --> 45:49.512
- mm-hmm.
- Is you're not going to

45:49.514 --> 45:50.463
come for me 'cause
we're not coming for you.

45:50.465 --> 45:51.397
- I wasn't coming for you.
- I'm not done.

45:51.399 --> 45:52.482
What you're not
going to do,

45:52.484 --> 45:53.799
is you're not
gonna come for me.

45:53.801 --> 45:54.650
- I was just telling
you what you weren't

45:54.652 --> 45:56.185
gonna do to me.
- You understand?

45:56.187 --> 45:57.687
So, don't do that.
So, don't do that.

45:57.689 --> 45:59.322
- So, just how you're
acting, is how you're

45:59.324 --> 46:00.473
not going to do to me.
- So, don't do that.

46:00.475 --> 46:01.407
- So, don't do that, okay?

46:01.409 --> 46:02.191
- Don't put your hand
in my face.

46:02.193 --> 46:03.025
- Well, it's your face.

46:03.027 --> 46:05.161
What are you gonna
do about it?

46:12.786 --> 46:14.570
- You're not going
to come for me 'cause

46:14.572 --> 46:15.321
we're not coming for you.
- I wasn't coming for you.

46:15.323 --> 46:17.540
- I'm not done.
Don't do that.

46:17.542 --> 46:18.491
- So, don't do that, okay?

46:18.493 --> 46:19.375
- Don't put your hand
in my face.

46:19.377 --> 46:20.409
- Well, it's your face.

46:20.411 --> 46:21.661
What are you gonna
do about it?

46:21.663 --> 46:23.296
- Oh.
- Well, we don't like

46:23.298 --> 46:25.431
hands in the face
in this group.

46:25.433 --> 46:28.217
- Chil', we're
not doin' this, again.

46:28.219 --> 46:29.168
You don't wanna
get in between

46:29.170 --> 46:30.386
other people's stuff.

46:30.388 --> 46:31.471
- We're givin' love.
We're givin' love.

46:31.473 --> 46:35.141
- That was so rude.
Oh, my god.

46:35.143 --> 46:40.897
I will not let mia get to
me because I am zen wen.

46:40.899 --> 46:42.765
Get your clit done.
Get your eyebrows done.

46:42.767 --> 46:44.567
Get your knee done.
I don't care.

46:44.569 --> 46:45.651
- Okay, no, you got
rid of the bumpiness.

46:45.653 --> 46:46.435
We're good.

46:46.437 --> 46:47.820
- No, I don't have
any bumpiness.

46:47.822 --> 46:49.121
I have a husband.
I have my girls.

46:49.123 --> 46:50.289
I have my kids.
I don't--

46:50.291 --> 46:51.324
- okay,
all right, well--

46:51.326 --> 46:52.224
- you got your booty.
- I got my booty.

46:52.226 --> 46:55.361
- Yes, yes!
- That thing shakes, too.

46:55.363 --> 46:58.030
- This butt has life.

46:58.032 --> 47:00.500
- The fact that wendy is
so completely bent out of

47:00.502 --> 47:03.870
shape tells me that wendy
is insecure, threatened,

47:03.872 --> 47:06.038
and it absolutely has
nothing to do with me.

47:06.040 --> 47:07.573
That has everything
to do with her.

47:07.575 --> 47:09.292
- And on that note,
ladies, we're doing a game.

47:09.294 --> 47:10.843
We're doing happily
married to find out

47:10.845 --> 47:12.078
how much we know
about our husbands

47:12.080 --> 47:13.129
or they know
about us.

47:13.131 --> 47:14.747
So, because
michael is not here,

47:14.749 --> 47:16.949
you are going to
be the emcee of the game.

47:16.951 --> 47:18.017
- Love it.

47:18.019 --> 47:19.602
- So, if I could
have you gentlemen

47:19.604 --> 47:21.521
come this way 'cause
we're gonna play a game.

47:21.523 --> 47:23.439
- Okay.
- This is gonna be fun.

47:23.441 --> 47:24.724
- Hey, girl.
- Hello, gorgeous.

47:24.726 --> 47:25.725
- You can sit
by mia, honey.

47:25.727 --> 47:26.692
- Yes.

47:26.694 --> 47:29.312
- You know "the newlywed
game," right, guys?

47:29.314 --> 47:30.863
- Is that what
we're playin'?

47:30.865 --> 47:32.632
- It's like that.
- Oh, god.

47:32.634 --> 47:34.500
- Okay, so, both of you
are going to write

47:34.502 --> 47:37.270
your answers down, but
there is no conferring,

47:37.272 --> 47:39.205
and then you show them
at the same time.

47:39.207 --> 47:40.873
- Yep-- ray, this is
serious stuff.

47:40.875 --> 47:41.841
Put the drink down.
Put the drink down.

47:41.843 --> 47:42.775
- Hey, don't peek
over here.

47:42.777 --> 47:43.643
- I put the drink down.
- I'm not peeking.

47:43.645 --> 47:45.077
- All right,
married folks.

47:45.079 --> 47:49.048
What is his favorite
sexual position?

47:49.050 --> 47:50.750
- Oh, okay.
- Oh.

47:50.752 --> 47:51.918
- How do you spell it?

47:53.838 --> 47:57.006
- No, take the "t" out.
- I'm-I'm ready.

47:57.008 --> 47:59.058
- Candiace and chris,
you're first.

47:59.060 --> 48:00.643
- Okay, we going
at the same time?

48:00.645 --> 48:02.061
- You can go first.
Whatever.

48:02.063 --> 48:03.429
- Me on top.

48:03.431 --> 48:05.097
- Bam!
- Her on top.

48:05.099 --> 48:07.650
- Okay, good.
You got a point.

48:07.652 --> 48:08.935
- Her on top.

48:08.937 --> 48:10.269
- I thought because of
what we're doin' now, go--

48:10.271 --> 48:11.237
gettin' ready to go
down the aisle,

48:11.239 --> 48:13.439
doin' everything
but standin' on my head,

48:13.441 --> 48:16.876
all of them.
- Oh.

48:16.878 --> 48:18.177
- One, two, three.

48:18.179 --> 48:22.415
- Oh!
- Doggystyle-- yes!

48:22.417 --> 48:23.532
- All right,
they get a point.

48:23.534 --> 48:24.483
- Oh, we get a point.
- They are the same, yes.

48:24.485 --> 48:27.587
- Yes.
- Oh, very good.

48:27.589 --> 48:29.589
- Missionary?

48:29.591 --> 48:31.724
- Yes,
we do a lot of it.

48:31.726 --> 48:33.125
- Where is
the craziest place

48:33.127 --> 48:36.012
that you have
ever had sex?

48:36.014 --> 48:37.363
We're starting with
candiace and chris.

48:37.365 --> 48:38.347
- What did you put?

48:38.349 --> 48:39.932
- The hotel balcony
in mexico.

48:39.934 --> 48:43.302
- Oh, that was
a good one!

48:43.304 --> 48:46.472
- Sorry, guys, no points.
Karen and ray, you ready?

48:46.474 --> 48:48.524
- Yeah.

48:48.526 --> 48:50.776
- Ooh, I-- well,
we ended up on the floor,

48:50.778 --> 48:51.877
but we started
on the countertop.

48:51.879 --> 48:53.946
- Yeah.
- Yes-- whoo!

48:53.948 --> 48:54.814
- Yes.

48:54.816 --> 48:56.449
- This is where
rayvin came from.

48:56.451 --> 48:58.150
- Oh, ray,
but don't say that.

48:58.152 --> 49:00.653
- Oh.
- Wendy and eddie?

49:00.655 --> 49:02.038
- What the-- in the park
at midnight.

49:02.040 --> 49:05.825
- In the park at midnight.
- Okay, all right.

49:05.827 --> 49:09.879
- Okay.
- This is the craziest place.

49:09.881 --> 49:12.164
- Waffle house bathroom.
- Waffle house bathroom.

49:12.166 --> 49:13.132
Look, look.

49:13.134 --> 49:16.585
[laughing]

49:16.587 --> 49:18.004
- I'll be damned.

49:18.006 --> 49:20.006
- All you gotta do
is just bend it over.

49:20.008 --> 49:23.409
- Ahh!
- In one word,

49:23.411 --> 49:27.313
how would you describe
your relationship?

49:27.315 --> 49:30.266
- I'm too verbose
for one word.

49:30.268 --> 49:31.283
- We know.

49:31.285 --> 49:32.601
- Okay, g and mia, would
you like to go first?

49:32.603 --> 49:34.654
- Wait, I'm not ready.
- Real.

49:34.656 --> 49:35.571
- Real.
- What'd she put down?

49:35.573 --> 49:37.239
- Real.
- Oh.

49:37.241 --> 49:39.075
- Yes, I'll take it.
- Amazing.

49:39.077 --> 49:42.161
Okay, next one.
- Crazy.

49:42.163 --> 49:43.412
- Okay.
- Oh, that's cute.

49:43.414 --> 49:44.697
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

49:44.699 --> 49:46.282
- And what did you put?
- Decent.

49:46.284 --> 49:48.668
[laughing]

49:48.670 --> 49:51.037
- is chris really
a two pump jump?

49:51.039 --> 49:52.505
- You know, we have
a decent time.

49:52.507 --> 49:54.373
- Decent?
- I said great.

49:54.375 --> 49:55.808
Great.
- Oh, great.

49:55.810 --> 49:59.378
- Okay, I said--
I'm bein' real-- work.

49:59.380 --> 50:00.413
- That's real.
- What'd you have?

50:00.415 --> 50:02.715
- I said loving.
- Aww.

50:02.717 --> 50:04.717
I said great, honest,
and loving.

50:04.719 --> 50:08.304
- That ain't one word.
- That's not one word.

50:08.306 --> 50:09.555
- But I got
his word, though.

50:09.557 --> 50:11.290
- It's only one word.
- Uh-uh.

50:11.292 --> 50:13.392
- Okay, I'm gonna--
I'm gonna give it to you.

50:13.394 --> 50:15.461
- Thank you, ashley.

50:15.463 --> 50:17.480
- If your husband was
attracted to one lady

50:17.482 --> 50:20.066
in your friend group,
who would it be?

50:20.068 --> 50:21.734
- Oh, sh--.
- Oh, boy.

50:24.122 --> 50:25.621
- What does that say?

50:27.742 --> 50:28.657
- Okay.

50:31.713 --> 50:34.413
- All right, we're starting
with mia and g.

50:34.415 --> 50:36.882
- Okay, ray, don't be upset.
- Oh!

50:36.884 --> 50:39.218
Oh, we got
the same one.

50:39.220 --> 50:41.220
- Where is my gun?
Where is my gun?

50:41.222 --> 50:43.355
- Candiace and chris?
Mia and gizelle.

50:43.357 --> 50:46.675
- So, chris loves gizelle.
He cooks for her.

50:46.677 --> 50:47.893
- They're the best chicken
wings you will eat.

50:47.895 --> 50:50.396
I promise.

50:50.398 --> 50:52.314
- Okay, well,
I'm loving the wings.

50:52.316 --> 50:55.735
- Ray and karen?
- I said mia.

50:55.737 --> 50:56.902
- Well...

50:58.106 --> 50:59.805
- Oh!
- Oh.

50:59.807 --> 51:03.242
- Ahh!
- Well, there is a shocker.

51:03.244 --> 51:06.445
- Katie?
- Look at this talent.

51:06.447 --> 51:07.580
- I know.
- I could get a job.

51:07.582 --> 51:10.149
- Yeah, I got
my eye on ray.

51:10.151 --> 51:11.250
What did you say?
- What do you go there?

51:11.252 --> 51:14.036
- One, two, three.
- Two.

51:14.038 --> 51:17.423
- None.

51:17.425 --> 51:18.707
- Not on me.
Not on me.

51:18.709 --> 51:20.292
- That's a chickensh--
answer, isn't it?

51:20.294 --> 51:21.877
- I agree.

51:21.879 --> 51:23.045
- Lies.

51:23.047 --> 51:25.765
I think that wendy
has programmed him

51:25.767 --> 51:26.966
to be team wendy,

51:26.968 --> 51:29.552
and I think that he has
a very insecure wife,

51:29.554 --> 51:32.037
and they need to
work on that.

51:32.039 --> 51:33.105
- Okay, last question.

51:33.107 --> 51:34.640
- And this is for
all the marbles.

51:34.642 --> 51:36.642
- Where did you meet
your spouse?

51:36.644 --> 51:37.777
- I like that one.

51:39.647 --> 51:41.280
- You guys wanna start?

51:41.282 --> 51:42.281
- We worked in
the same restaurant.

51:42.283 --> 51:44.216
- Yes, yes.
- Okay, karen and ray.

51:44.218 --> 51:46.619
- The black
congressional caucus.

51:46.621 --> 51:48.070
- Oh, you guys met at cbc.
- Yeah, cbc.

51:48.072 --> 51:50.906
- At little caesars.
- Oh, I love that!

51:50.908 --> 51:52.625
- All right,
wendy and eddie.

51:52.627 --> 51:53.959
- So, we met
when we were--

51:53.961 --> 51:56.028
- we were 17.
- Okay, mm-hmm.

51:56.030 --> 51:56.662
We met when we were--
- no, show your--

51:56.664 --> 51:57.730
it said 17, right?

51:57.732 --> 51:58.664
- Okay, I had--
okay, it said 17.

51:58.666 --> 51:59.715
- Boom.

51:59.717 --> 52:01.250
- So, we met when we were
17 when her family

52:01.252 --> 52:02.501
moved to baltimore.

52:02.503 --> 52:03.836
- When my family
moved to baltimore.

52:03.838 --> 52:07.506
- Oh, that's cute.
- G and mia?

52:07.508 --> 52:09.391
- Okay, let's do it.

52:09.393 --> 52:12.511
- Whoo!
- Whoa.

52:12.513 --> 52:14.263
- Was somebody strippin'?
- That's what I'm sayin'.

52:14.265 --> 52:15.514
You were bartendin'.
- Mm-hmm.

52:15.516 --> 52:16.682
- Okay.

52:18.903 --> 52:19.919
Girl, you were
a stripper.

52:19.921 --> 52:24.440
That is the only thing
that can explain having

52:24.442 --> 52:26.158
a clitoral
reconstructive surgery.

52:26.160 --> 52:28.777
Strippers have to make it
clap on the stage.

52:28.779 --> 52:31.363
The winners of your game
were wendy and eddie.

52:31.365 --> 52:33.666
[cheers and applause]

52:33.668 --> 52:35.618
but at a close second,
was mia and g.

52:35.620 --> 52:38.120
- Thank you.
- We're number two.

52:38.122 --> 52:40.673
- The love party
was a huge success

52:40.675 --> 52:43.042
and so revealing.

52:43.044 --> 52:44.960
- Thank you, karen, for
having us in your home.

52:44.962 --> 52:46.128
- Thank you for coming.

52:46.130 --> 52:48.881
But I see mia, you know,
do a little wiggle,

52:48.883 --> 52:52.017
and I'm not sure that mia
was just a bartender

52:52.019 --> 52:53.302
at the strip club.
I'm not sure.

52:53.304 --> 52:56.655
- Girl, if you was
a bartender,

52:56.657 --> 52:58.057
I'm a white man.

52:58.059 --> 53:02.361
♪♪

53:02.363 --> 53:04.563
- next time, on
"the real housewives
of potomac"...

53:04.565 --> 53:06.115
- So, wendy,
this is askale.

53:06.117 --> 53:07.399
- Hi.
- Hi.

53:07.401 --> 53:10.035
- She's your african sister.
- She got her loub.

53:10.037 --> 53:12.338
- What?
- My type of girl.

53:12.340 --> 53:15.157
- My mom, she's probably
doin' the best that she can,

53:15.159 --> 53:18.127
but I think that I am
never going to, like,

53:18.129 --> 53:22.681
fully open up to her
because I don't trust her.

53:22.683 --> 53:26.218
- Have I told you chris
is, like, managing me?

53:28.789 --> 53:29.972
- Robyn, you gotta get
outta the bed.

53:29.974 --> 53:31.257
Go, do somethin'
with your time.

53:31.259 --> 53:33.559
- All right. It's the pandemic.
- You're always makin' excuses.

53:33.561 --> 53:35.844
I'm tired of it.

53:35.846 --> 53:38.480
- I asked you guys
to send in pictures

53:38.482 --> 53:41.567
of when you guys were
beautifully pregnant.

53:41.569 --> 53:43.903
This is
my favorite one.

53:43.905 --> 53:45.571
- Wait a minute.

53:45.573 --> 53:48.340
- I am zen wen,
so do not try to come for me

53:48.342 --> 53:49.775
because what
I do have

53:49.777 --> 53:51.944
and what I will
always have, is time.

53:51.946 --> 53:53.879
So, tick-tock, mia.

53:53.881 --> 53:55.698
- Clearly, she's unhappy
at home, so--

53:55.700 --> 53:57.549
- uh, no, sweetie,
you're unhappy at home.

53:57.551 --> 53:58.784
That's why you need to get
your clit fixed.

53:58.786 --> 54:00.085
- Girl.
- Ahh!
