Swell.

00:24.232 --> 00:26.777
ELIZABETH: It's my favorite
time of year again,

00:26.777 --> 00:30.614
when giving and sharing
is on everyone's mind.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.617
To me, Hope Valley

00:33.617 --> 00:37.204
embodies the joy and the spirit
of the Christmas season.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.957
But this Christmas,

00:39.957 --> 00:42.835
the love of my life
is far away.

00:42.835 --> 00:45.754
Six months
has felt like a lifetime.

00:45.754 --> 00:48.256
I miss Jack dearly.

00:48.256 --> 00:49.800
Wherever he is,

00:49.800 --> 00:52.344
I know he's making our world
a safer place.

00:52.344 --> 00:56.932
He's brave,
so I must be brave, too.

00:56.932 --> 01:01.144
Before he left, Jack made me
the happiest woman on Earth.

01:01.144 --> 01:05.482
And then, just as quickly,
he was gone.

01:05.482 --> 01:09.570
This holiday season,
hope and faith sustain me

01:09.570 --> 01:12.197
until I can
be with Jack again.

01:13.908 --> 01:16.159
ELIZABETH: "So look within
and you will see

01:16.159 --> 01:19.496
"the magic
of the wishing tree.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.248
"So make a wish
and tie it on,

01:21.248 --> 01:24.001
"and soon, your wish
just might be gone,

01:24.001 --> 01:26.503
"which means
that someone cares for you,

01:26.503 --> 01:30.591
and they might
make your wish come true."

01:30.591 --> 01:33.468
The end. Mm-hmm? Laura?

01:33.468 --> 01:35.596
So if you put a wish
on the tree,

01:35.596 --> 01:37.389
then you get
what you asked for?

01:37.389 --> 01:40.350
That's the idea.
And according to the book,

01:40.350 --> 01:42.185
your wish
can be for anything--

01:42.185 --> 01:45.564
a toy,
a hope, a dream,

01:45.564 --> 01:47.148
then someone
can take your wish

01:47.148 --> 01:48.692
and try to make it come true.

01:48.692 --> 01:49.944
Yes. Philip?

01:49.944 --> 01:51.445
What if they can't?

01:51.445 --> 01:53.280
That's what's special
about the tree.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.532
If one person
can't make your wish come true,

01:55.532 --> 01:57.034
then the legend says

01:57.034 --> 01:59.703
that the tree
can magically make it happen.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.622
Can it make a wish
for someone else?

02:01.622 --> 02:03.331
Those are the best kind.

02:03.331 --> 02:05.125
I wish we could get
a wishing tree.

Well, Opal,
I am happy to report

02:59.972 --> 03:02.016
You could put that wish

10:29.087 --> 10:31.339
When you were here
for your last exam,

10:31.339 --> 10:34.092
you told Nurse Carter
you had been married before.

10:34.092 --> 10:37.387
Husband died in an accident.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.846
And no other family?

10:38.846 --> 10:42.350
We wanted kids.
Never had 'em.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.519
I'm sorry to hear that,
Mrs. McCormick.

10:44.519 --> 10:47.688
Oh, no need to be.
I do well on my own.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.191
Of course. And, uh...

10:50.191 --> 10:52.735
I'm happy to say
that you are very healthy.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.488
Just keep on
taking your medicine.

10:54.488 --> 10:57.282
So give it to me,
and I'll be on my way.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.909
I ordered it from Union City.
Should be here today.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.077
I got things to do.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.246
I can't be
hanging around town all day.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.290
Okay, that's no problem.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.834
I'll, um, I'll run it
by your cabin for you.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.129
Is there an extra charge?

11:11.129 --> 11:14.382
[CHUCKLES]
No, there's no charge.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.675
Then that'll be fine.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.721
Okay. So, we'll
see you later, then.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.681
Do I have a choice?

11:28.729 --> 11:30.524
I'll come by the store
later.

11:30.524 --> 11:31.899
Okay.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.860
So, have you
put up your wish yet?

11:33.860 --> 11:36.070
Not yet.
You better hurry.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.323
You're not the only one
wishing for a Mountie,

11:38.323 --> 11:40.450
and there may be a limit
on Mountie wishes.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.493
Miss Thatcher.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.286
Hi, Robert.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.121
Someone took my wish
off the tree.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.873
I know. It was me.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.333
Really?
Mm-hmm.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.751
So my baby brother or sister
is gonna get a crib?

11:50.751 --> 11:51.836
Yep.

11:51.836 --> 11:52.920
Thank you.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.797
Oh, you're welcome.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.011
I've heard the Christmas band,
Abigail.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.180
I'm sure they just need
a little fine-tuning.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.224
There's no such thing
as "fine" or "tune"

12:04.224 --> 12:05.350
in this group.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.767
But you'll do it?

12:06.767 --> 12:09.103
Let me carry that for you.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.650
What are you mailing,
an anchor?

12:13.650 --> 12:15.610
It's a shipment
of my scones.

12:15.610 --> 12:19.239
Oh. Sorry. So who's gonna
get to enjoy

12:19.239 --> 12:21.824
these light,
fluffy delicacies?

12:22.825 --> 12:24.911
Henry Gowen.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.334
I know what
you're going to say.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.670
What you do with your baking
is your business.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.630
Besides, Henry
could probably use

12:35.630 --> 12:37.131
some homemade treats
to warm him up.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.050
Those tent camps
get cold at night.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.552
What tent camps?

12:40.552 --> 12:42.887
The detention facilities
are getting overcrowded

12:42.887 --> 12:45.432
due to the prisoners
from the Northern Territories,

12:45.432 --> 12:47.601
so they're housing inmates
in a tent camp.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.143
But it's winter.

12:49.143 --> 12:52.230
Well, criminal justice
isn't supposed to be pleasant.

12:52.230 --> 12:55.442
Can't we offer Henry
some charity?

12:55.442 --> 12:57.444
Maybe he could come here
for the holidays.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.738
Abigail, the man conspired
with the railroad

12:59.738 --> 13:01.030
to steal from this town.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.074
He doesn't deserve
any kindness from us.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.825
Bill, if we can't
forgive people,

13:04.825 --> 13:07.161
then I don't think
we're doing things right.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.539
You're not serious
about Gowen?

13:12.584 --> 13:14.335
You are serious.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.630
He can stay in the jail
where it's warm.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.256
And I'd be his maid?
No, thanks.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.882
He can sleep in the cell
at night

13:19.882 --> 13:21.800
and do community service
during the day.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.345
Community service.
I'm sure our former mayor

13:24.345 --> 13:26.431
would just love to be
someone's lackey.

13:26.431 --> 13:30.477
I'm sure our current one
would be beholden to you.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.104
Are you pulling rank on me?
Is that how this goes?

13:33.104 --> 13:34.481
Might do him some good

13:34.481 --> 13:36.566
to see what it's like
to help other people.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.901
You're not backing down
on this, are you?

13:44.324 --> 13:46.451
I'll try to call in a favor.

13:52.624 --> 13:55.876
Oh, Elizabeth. I need
your thoughts on something.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.004
Sure.
Is that needlepoint?

13:58.004 --> 13:59.964
Mm-hmm. I'm making
a pillow for Jack.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.342
It's still a little rough
around the edges, but...

14:02.342 --> 14:04.552
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.221
Is it really
that rough?

14:07.221 --> 14:10.057
So, friend to friend.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.850
Am I too pushy?

14:11.850 --> 14:14.771
Wait. Don't answer that.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.856
No. Yes, I do want an answer.

14:17.856 --> 14:20.026
Now. Elizabeth,
what are you waiting for?

14:21.402 --> 14:22.862
Where is this
coming from?

14:22.862 --> 14:24.656
Today at Abigail's.

14:24.656 --> 14:27.492
I mean, come on.
I was the obvious choice.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.452
Bandleader?

14:29.452 --> 14:31.621
Yes. What else
would I be talking about?

14:31.621 --> 14:34.374
Rosemary, you are the
obvious choice for everything.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.750
I'm a woman of many talents.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.210
And opinions.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.086
Because I care about
a lot of things.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.797
I know, but, Rosemary,

14:40.797 --> 14:43.717
sometimes you have to let
other people shine.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.803
Think of a community
like... a night sky.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.723
Would you rather see one star
or it teeming with many?

14:49.723 --> 14:52.350
Depends. Am I the one star?

14:52.350 --> 14:54.185
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
That's Lee.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.354
We're going to Abigail's
for something to eat.

14:56.354 --> 14:59.524
Have you tied your wish
to the wishing tree?

14:59.524 --> 15:01.776
Ahh. Not yet.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.653
What?

15:06.781 --> 15:08.491
Why not?

15:08.491 --> 15:11.452
I don't know.

15:11.452 --> 15:14.748
I think you do.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.708
I'm trying to be strong
for Jack.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.043
And you think
tying your wish to the tree

15:19.043 --> 15:20.336
is somehow not being strong?

15:20.336 --> 15:22.171
It's just so dangerous
where he is.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.507
He has to be strong
every second of every day.

15:24.507 --> 15:27.301
Yes, it's
a very dangerous world,

15:27.301 --> 15:29.763
and, yes,
we have to be strong,

15:29.763 --> 15:33.391
but tying a wish to a tree
is not weak.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.851

15:35.852 --> 15:38.145
There is a place
for wishing,

15:38.145 --> 15:40.106

all of your might.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.608
Do you know why?

15:41.608 --> 15:43.610
Why?

15:43.610 --> 15:45.862

wishes come true,

15:45.862 --> 15:48.197

something in common after all.

No, it's true.

until the last minute.

for the holidays anymore.

you have to take it down again?
