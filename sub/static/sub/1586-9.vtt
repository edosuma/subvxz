WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.632
<i>Erstwhile on</i> Fargo...

00:03.760 --> 00:05.592
Mom home?
Yeah.

00:05.720 --> 00:07.120
Let's eat.
I'm starving.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.189
<i>FBI.</i>

00:08.320 --> 00:09.674
<i>I called a couple
times now about</i>

00:09.760 --> 00:10.989
the Fargo
Syndicate massacre...

00:11.080 --> 00:13.276
<i>Now I might know
the fella responsible...</i>

00:13.360 --> 00:14.430
Jesus!

00:14.520 --> 00:16.477
This is where you work now.

00:16.560 --> 00:17.960
I have a commendation.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.230
<i>I give you...</i>

00:19.320 --> 00:22.199
<i>Insurance
Salesman of the Year,
Lester Nygaard!</i>

00:23.440 --> 00:25.193
So proud of ya, Lester.

00:25.280 --> 00:28.034
Oh, Miss? Can we have
some more sparkling water?

01:11.800 --> 01:14.872
And this is any animal.
Pig, gopher, chicken...

01:15.000 --> 01:16.719
They go long enough
without sleep,

01:16.840 --> 01:19.196
you start to see
abnormalities
behavior-wise.

01:19.840 --> 01:22.071
First there's
the inability
to concentrate

01:22.200 --> 01:24.396
and perform certain
fine motor skills.

01:24.520 --> 01:25.715
Then you start to see...

01:25.840 --> 01:27.832
And the army did studies
on this in the '50s.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.759
The effects of
sleep deprivation
on the human brain.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.957
I know 'cause
a buddy of my dad's

01:33.040 --> 01:34.952
was a subject back during
the Korean conflict.

01:35.520 --> 01:36.920
I mean, shit, Ray,
what's the longest

01:37.000 --> 01:38.514
you've ever
gone without sleep?

01:40.360 --> 01:41.510
Five days for me.

01:41.640 --> 01:42.960
This was back
in dental school.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.276
Marty Perlmutter
stole a prescription pad,

01:45.360 --> 01:49.513
wrote us all
a scrip for amphetamines,
so we could cram for finals.

01:50.040 --> 01:53.272
And boy howdy, I tell ya...
After three days
of no sleeping,

01:53.360 --> 01:54.680
I was an animal.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.993
All right, <i>mi amigo.</i>
That ought to do it.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.600
I'm still a little worried
about the 203 and the 204.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.074
So we should
make an appointment

02:06.160 --> 02:07.992
to get together again
in about six months.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.800
Appreciate it, Doc.

02:11.039 --> 02:15.034
Really.
This black fella rolled over
my foot with a steam cleaner.

02:15.120 --> 02:18.113
And I tell ya, this hurt worse
than that did by a long shot.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.879
Yeah, nerve pain,
that's a bear.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.751
Oh, you wanna
avoid nut brittles

02:22.840 --> 02:25.480
for a few days,
and any kind
of fruit with pits.

02:25.560 --> 02:26.710
Jemma's got a pamphlet.

02:26.800 --> 02:27.995
All right.
Okay.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.037
Yo, Mick Mike...

02:31.480 --> 02:32.994
We still on for
golf next week?

02:33.280 --> 02:34.475
Of course, we are,
Burty Burt.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.640
But more importantly,
are you and Louise
still gonna make it on Sunday?

02:37.880 --> 02:40.076
Uh, do dogs smell
each other's butts?

02:41.040 --> 02:44.078
I think I might have
observed that type of
behavior on occasion.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.798
Well, we'll be there.
Weezy's making her
famous five bean dip.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.590
Aces.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.553
Oh, thanks, babe.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.717
Mick Mike.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.952
I just keep
pinching myself.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.193
Honey, you've earned it.
It's like my mom always said,

03:33.280 --> 03:36.637
"Boys, if you like the milk,
buy the freakin' cow."

03:37.640 --> 03:39.040
Aw, that's so sweet.

03:40.320 --> 03:44.234
I am gonna
stick my whole thumb
up your ass later.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.390
Aces.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.230
Yello.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.390
Hey, hey.

04:04.080 --> 04:07.312
Darling,
is this guy bothering
you or what?

04:07.400 --> 04:08.390
You!

04:08.480 --> 04:11.518
We're gonna tie one
on tonight, friend-o.
I'm telling you.

04:11.640 --> 04:14.314
No time like the present.
That's what I always say.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.238
Bean dip?
You betcha.

04:16.360 --> 04:17.350
Oh.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.832
You look great.
You too.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.400
Ice wine.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.513
Buddy of mine says
they swear by this
stuff in Finland.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.035
Well, they're all a bunch
of sex-crazed alcoholics.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.440
So they should
know, right?

04:42.120 --> 04:43.520
Sweet.
Hmm.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.194
Weezy says you
popped the question.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.272
Gonna make
Jemma an honest woman.

04:49.360 --> 04:52.558
Oh, yeah, I cried like a baby.
I'm not afraid to admit it.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.711
Well, she's
something else,
that Jemma.

04:55.720 --> 04:59.191
Just between us girls
that body, is it...

04:59.360 --> 05:00.350
I mean...

05:02.040 --> 05:03.872
What's she like in the sack?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.474
Hellcat.
That's the only word for it.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.789
Shit.

05:13.560 --> 05:16.075
Weezy's basically
a Jew in the bedroom.

05:16.160 --> 05:18.152
Oh, you mean
she wears a wig

05:18.240 --> 05:20.391
and makes you
do it through a hole
in the sheet? Yeah.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.477
No. No.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.359
She stopped
putting it in her mouth

05:27.440 --> 05:29.159
as soon as the ring
went on her finger.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.311
That's a national tragedy,
Burt.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.076
Amen.

05:36.080 --> 05:39.232
Gotta tell ya,
Mick Mike, I sure do like
having you around.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.152
Likewise, Burty Burt.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.072
The office was dead dull
until you showed up.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.357
Positively geriatric.

05:47.440 --> 05:50.512
I'm a rascal.
There's no two
ways about it.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.398
Yessiree, Bob.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.157
Like I told you before,
you and my brother

05:56.280 --> 05:58.272
would get along
like gangbusters.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.476
Well, I'd like to meet him.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.596
Yeah.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.672
Like I said, it's tricky.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.115
He's in witness protection.
Say what?

06:11.200 --> 06:14.398
I said, he's in
witness protection.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.555
Turned state's
evidence against
these mob guys outta Chicago.

06:18.640 --> 06:19.756
Told him not to.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.112
Now, I haven't seen
him in over a year.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.796
He still calls though.
Not supposed to.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.753
You can't break
up the Canton boys.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.479
I'll betcha.

06:44.640 --> 06:47.109
Oh, screw it.
What are you
doing next weekend?

06:48.440 --> 06:49.760
You tell me.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.115
Oh, I like that,
"You tell me."

06:52.240 --> 06:55.199
Well...
Weezy and me,
we're headed

06:55.280 --> 06:58.193
for Vegas to
a little family reunion.

06:58.280 --> 07:01.557
Why don't you and
Jemma tag along?

07:02.960 --> 07:03.950
Aces.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.960
<i>You did this to me.</i>

07:15.280 --> 07:18.193
<i>I had a wife, family.</i>

07:18.680 --> 07:20.353
<i>I was happy.</i>

07:20.800 --> 07:23.190
<i>And then you started...
Started what?</i>

07:24.000 --> 07:25.195
<i>All we did was talk.</i>

07:25.560 --> 07:29.520
<i>No, that's not...
No, you said things...
Jumbled me up.</i>

07:30.600 --> 07:33.479
<i>You told me I needed...
Now, they're dead.</i>

07:33.560 --> 07:36.359
<i>Why'd I listen to you? Why?</i>

07:40.880 --> 07:44.271
<i>Tell my wife I love her.</i>

08:24.920 --> 08:26.957
Oh, honey, can we get
some more sparkling water?

08:27.040 --> 08:28.360
Thank you.

08:28.760 --> 08:32.470
I put my mask on.
Tawny hands me
the number two needle.

08:32.559 --> 08:34.631
I start to give
the guy a novocaine shot.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.712
Well, I stick
the needle in
my own finger.

08:36.799 --> 08:38.154
And... Yeah.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.712
And it hurt,
but I don't want
to look dumb,

08:40.799 --> 08:44.430
so I try it again.
The next time,
I stick it in my thumb.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.594
Now I'm so flustered
that I go to take my mask off,

08:47.680 --> 08:51.276
while I'm still
holding the needle,
jab it right in my face.

08:53.400 --> 08:57.952
And the patient is like...
"Doc, what's wrong?"
And I'm like...

09:02.320 --> 09:03.879
I can't even move my arm.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.314
I mean, it was insane.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.794
You're a riot.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.997
He's a riot.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.833
You have no idea.

09:12.720 --> 09:16.999
So,
we are all set for tomorrow,

09:17.080 --> 09:20.835
to go see
you-know-who.
Should be fun.

09:20.920 --> 09:25.278
Real clandestine stuff,
change cars twice, no phones.

09:25.720 --> 09:28.758
Geez, who did you say
is after this guy again?

09:29.960 --> 09:31.474
Well,
what are the odds?

09:33.160 --> 09:34.389
Sorry?

09:37.600 --> 09:39.751
It's me, Lester.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.436
I'm sorry, sir.
You must have me
confused with someone else.

09:42.560 --> 09:45.120
No. Minnesota,
last year?

09:46.120 --> 09:47.634
The emergency room?

09:48.160 --> 09:50.880
I didn't recognize
you at first either,
'cause you got a whole new...

09:50.960 --> 09:52.314
But hey, so have I.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.080
What do you think
of the suit?

09:55.360 --> 09:58.114
Bill Blass.
Check this out.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.755
Salesman of the Year.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.276
They gave it to me
on a stage and everything.

10:03.360 --> 10:05.033
Uh, Mick Mike.
You gonna introduce us
to your friend there?

10:05.120 --> 10:06.270
You know,
I'd love to, Burt.

10:06.360 --> 10:09.717
But unfortunately,
I've never met this
man before in my life.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.154
What?

10:15.240 --> 10:17.516
Right, we don't know
each other.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.589
Okay, honey, let's go.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.559
We're never
gonna make the show
if we don't get out of here.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.109
Walk away.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.199
Sorry, I must have...

10:33.360 --> 10:35.431
Congratulations
on your award.
Thank you.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.352
Burt, did I ever
tell you about the time

10:37.440 --> 10:39.238
I made a night guard
for Britney Spears?

10:39.320 --> 10:40.549
I swear.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.520
Come on.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.593
He was a piece of work, huh?
Who's that?

10:55.680 --> 10:58.798
That guy in the bar.
You sure you don't know him?

10:58.880 --> 11:02.351
People nab me all the time.
Just one of
those faces, I guess.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.635
No.

11:07.720 --> 11:08.756
You don't get to...

11:08.840 --> 11:10.240
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but it's not right.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.640
And when
something's
not right,

11:12.440 --> 11:15.433
well, the old Lester,
now, he would have
just let it slide.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.440
But not this guy.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.716
I've worked too hard.
I've come too far...

11:21.800 --> 11:23.075
Lester, stop.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.919
So now you do know me.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.070
Honey?

11:33.560 --> 11:35.074
Is this what you want?

11:38.440 --> 11:39.476
Ah.

11:39.560 --> 11:42.359
Hey, Mick Mike,
lighten up, huh?

11:44.720 --> 11:48.396
Lester, is this
what you want?

12:00.160 --> 12:01.640
Yes or no?

12:08.440 --> 12:09.760
Yes.

12:19.640 --> 12:21.154
Oh, my God!

12:26.240 --> 12:27.230
Oh, my...

12:28.960 --> 12:30.110
That's on you.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.511
I worked this guy
for six months, Lester,
six months.

12:50.960 --> 12:54.874
Can you imagine the number
of sewer mouths
I put my hands in?

12:55.560 --> 12:57.438
The gallons of human spit?

12:59.120 --> 13:02.352
Plus, the $100,000 bounty
down the toilet, but...

13:04.960 --> 13:08.954
Still, the look on his face
when I pulled the gun.
Classic, huh?

13:15.640 --> 13:17.996
Grab the fat guy's feet.
We'll throw him in a dumpster.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.599
Shit, Lester.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.038
See you later, Lester.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.120
See you soon.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.074
Shit.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.075
All right.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.595
Okay. Get dressed.
We gotta...

14:08.080 --> 14:10.311
Lester, are you okay?

14:11.440 --> 14:13.238
Get dressed!
Get dressed!

14:13.320 --> 14:14.913
Get dressed!
Get dressed!
Come on.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.594
Okay. Go, go.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.799
All right. Let's go.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.793
Keep up, hon.
Keep up.

14:59.480 --> 15:00.596
Lester, you're
hurting my hand.

15:00.680 --> 15:01.796
Sorry. Sorry.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.160
Okay, okay. Come on.

15:46.160 --> 15:49.471
A man has a fox,
a rabbit and a cabbage.

15:49.560 --> 15:50.630
What man?

15:51.240 --> 15:53.118
Any man. A man.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.709
Colonel Sanders?

15:57.040 --> 15:59.271
Could be, could be
George W. Bush.

15:59.360 --> 16:02.797
Why would George W. Bush
have a fox and
a rabbit and a cabbage?

16:02.880 --> 16:05.793
Just listen. A man
has a fox, a rabbit
and a cabbage

16:05.880 --> 16:07.394
and he wants to
get across the river,

16:07.480 --> 16:09.437
but his boat
can only carry one
of them at a time.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.233
Get a bigger boat.
No, no. That's
not an option.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.396
And here's the problem...

16:12.480 --> 16:14.437
If the man leaves
the fox and the rabbit
alone,

16:14.520 --> 16:16.398
the fox is gonna
eat the rabbit.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.312
And the same
for the rabbit
and the cabbage.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.632
So how does the man
get all three of his
items across the river

16:21.720 --> 16:23.074
without losing
any of them?

16:27.160 --> 16:28.196
A turducken.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.229
A... What's that now?

16:31.880 --> 16:35.032
He stuffs
the cabbage in the rabbit
and the rabbit in the fox,

16:36.400 --> 16:37.720
and he eats all of them.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.589
That's not the answer.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.675
It's an answer.

16:48.720 --> 16:49.756
Hello?

16:50.720 --> 16:52.234
Incoming or outgoing?

16:53.520 --> 16:55.591
I need you to pull
the Syndicate file.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.510
Why?

16:59.520 --> 17:01.830
Is it like
a clown car
back there?

17:01.920 --> 17:03.434
Why do you need
the Syndicate file?

17:03.520 --> 17:05.829
Yeah. Did something
happen with the case?
A break?

17:05.960 --> 17:08.270
No. Just a phone
call I've gotta log.

17:08.359 --> 17:09.635
Phone call from who?
Yeah, who called?

17:09.720 --> 17:11.313
That's really
not your business.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.109
Hey.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.439
Deputy Solverson.
Solverson. What does he say?

17:15.520 --> 17:17.397
Says he knows who did it.
Okay.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.269
Where's Bemidji?

17:29.640 --> 17:30.915
Thanks, Dad.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.480
I think I'd look
cool with a limp.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.713
Saw the profile of
Bill in the paper.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.476
Yup.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.315
For the record,
I advised against

17:40.400 --> 17:42.119
wearing a sword
in that picture.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.312
Honey, pass the syrup.
Yeah.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.630
Anyway, I'm in charge
today on account of...

17:47.720 --> 17:51.953
Bill's on his way
to St. Paul now for a...
What do you call it?

17:52.240 --> 17:53.993
Law enforcement conference.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.839
So, watch your butts.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.516
How's the route?

17:59.200 --> 18:02.637
Can't complain.
Takes me out by the lake.
It's a nice drive.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.551
Dated the girl
who delivered
my mail once...

18:05.840 --> 18:07.115
After her mother.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.319
Convenient at first.

18:09.440 --> 18:12.160
Awkward after,
once we broke up.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.360
Seeing her every day.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.833
Ended up moving to
a different neighborhood.

18:19.440 --> 18:20.840
So that's why we moved.

18:22.480 --> 18:25.279
You know you could
have just had
your mail sent to work.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.040
I never thought of that.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.350
So when's your last day?

18:32.880 --> 18:34.519
About a month.
She's nesting.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.513
Uh, geez. You know,
you buy one
throw pillow...

18:39.200 --> 18:40.793
We better...

18:44.200 --> 18:45.793
Bye.
Bye, kids.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.312
Hey, and go fishing later?

18:51.640 --> 18:54.951
You're the granddaughter
I always wanted,
but was afraid to buy online.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.156
Bye.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.230
You did good, hon.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.556
Yeah, and you
by proximity, huh?

19:17.560 --> 19:18.550
Solverson.

19:19.880 --> 19:23.032
Bill? Yeah. No.
He's in the
Twin Cities for...

19:25.480 --> 19:28.757
Oh, geez.
Three people, uh.
Killed how?

19:30.760 --> 19:33.070
In an elevator, huh?
You say one's a dentist?

19:34.240 --> 19:37.039
Yeah, I'm...
What do Las Vegas
police want me to...

19:39.160 --> 19:40.958
Oh, sure. Yeah.

19:41.440 --> 19:44.433
Yeah. No,
I can go see their witness,
get a statement.

19:44.520 --> 19:47.592
What's... What's
the witness' name then?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.349
Will you slow down?

20:02.440 --> 20:04.796
You'd think we were
being chased.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.190
Sorry.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.674
Was it me?

20:15.760 --> 20:17.194
Did I do something?

20:17.320 --> 20:18.674
What?
No, I told you.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.559
I made a lot
of new contacts
at the awards.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.471
Big fish.
You have to strike
while the iron's hot.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.995
I know, but you woke me up
in the middle of the night.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.316
Oh, I'll make it up to you.
How's that?

20:31.200 --> 20:33.032
We can take a trip.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.199
Anywhere you wanna go.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.717
Natalie says in
Acapulco you get

20:37.840 --> 20:40.753
to drink rum right
out of the coconut.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.240
Acapulco it is.

20:43.400 --> 20:47.758
In fact, uh, why don't...
We should leave tonight.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.270
Really?

20:49.360 --> 20:50.840
Sure. Yeah.
I mean, why not?

20:50.920 --> 20:52.832
A little fun in the sun,
drink from a coconut.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.559
We deserve it, huh?

20:54.640 --> 20:56.711
What about work?
Your big fish?

20:56.800 --> 20:59.315
Well, you only
live once, right?

20:59.400 --> 21:01.596
Let's just...
We'll go home,

21:01.680 --> 21:03.797
pack some stuff
then head back
to the airport.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.440
Have our toes in
the sand by dawn,
a real adventure.

21:06.520 --> 21:07.920
Oh, Lester.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.190
Okay.

21:31.840 --> 21:35.231
Now, here is
what you're gonna do.

21:35.320 --> 21:38.791
You're gonna go inside
and pack your best bikini.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.156
I'm gonna get changed
and head to the office.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.960
And I'm gonna buy the tickets,
get the passports...

21:44.040 --> 21:46.794
And then we are
gonna run away together.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.311
Heck, we might
never come back.

22:00.840 --> 22:03.992
Thanks, hon.
There we go.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.076
<i>Trust the circles,
whenever you go around,</i>

23:51.200 --> 23:53.510
<i>just keep going, even though
you think you'll fail.</i>

23:55.000 --> 23:58.277
So I checked and there's
an 11:00 out of Minneapolis.

23:58.360 --> 23:59.589
So we should be on
the road by 6:00.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.514
Okay. I'll defrost
that pea soup.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.114
We can have
that before we go.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.554
Oh, yeah, sounds good.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.356
Love you, hon.

24:07.440 --> 24:08.590
Love you, too.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.276
Oh.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.158
Scared me there.
Startled me.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.471
Mr. Nygaard,
Deputy Solverson.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.199
Maybe you remember?
Yeah, sure.

24:23.280 --> 24:26.876
I'm sorry to bother you,
but we got a call
from Las Vegas PD.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.317
What?
Las Vegas police?

24:29.480 --> 24:31.073
And they said you were, um...

24:31.160 --> 24:33.755
That you might be
a witness to a murder.

24:34.080 --> 24:35.434
Uh, three murders, actually.

24:35.560 --> 24:36.516
Lester?

24:36.600 --> 24:38.796
It's fine.
Go back to your show.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.075
Is everything okay?

24:40.160 --> 24:42.516
Yes, ma'am,
just a routine inquiry.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.159
Is now a good time
to ask you a few questions?

24:44.240 --> 24:45.560
No.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.070
Oh.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.276
I've got an appointment.

24:48.400 --> 24:51.040
I gotta get to work
and Linda's got shopping.

24:51.120 --> 24:55.831
Now, Lester. Don't be rude.
We just got back
from Las Vegas.

24:56.360 --> 24:58.750
Can you tell me
what this is about,
or is that classified?

24:59.280 --> 25:00.680
Oh, well, yeah, actually...

25:00.760 --> 25:04.754
I could come to the station
this afternoon and
give a statement?

25:05.240 --> 25:08.836
Not that I,
you know,
saw anything.

25:08.920 --> 25:12.470
Honestly, Lester, stay or go,
but I got a bladder
the size of a penny.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.432
Oh, you poor thing.
Please, come in.

25:14.520 --> 25:17.160
Thank you.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.714
Hey, guys.
Is your dad around?

26:24.800 --> 26:27.474
Yeah. Daddy!

26:27.560 --> 26:28.835
Dad!

26:34.120 --> 26:35.156
Help ya?

26:35.280 --> 26:38.318
I'm not sure.
I'm looking for
Lester Nygaard.

26:39.360 --> 26:42.353
Oh, yeah. We bought the place
from him in the fall.
Nice guy.

26:42.440 --> 26:45.353
Yeah, that's Lester,
all right, nicest guy
you'll ever meet.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.193
You got any idea
how I can find him?

26:48.040 --> 26:50.600
Uh, I don't have
a forwarding address.

26:50.680 --> 26:52.239
He's got the shop
over on Third, though.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.674
Is that Bo Munk?

26:53.760 --> 26:55.114
No. Got his own
place now,

26:55.200 --> 26:57.192
with his name on it.
Oh, nice.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.112
Like I said, over on Third.
You can't miss it.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.395
Okay. Thanks.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.030
Oh, uh...

27:02.800 --> 27:03.916
One more thing.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.560
You do know
people were murdered
in this house, right?

27:06.640 --> 27:08.279
Hell of a thing.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.239
Man in
the living room, shotgun,
woman in the basement.

27:11.320 --> 27:13.232
I think it was
a hammering.

27:14.440 --> 27:15.669
Afterwards Lester told me

27:15.760 --> 27:18.355
he used to hear noises coming
from the basement at night.

27:19.800 --> 27:23.032
Footsteps on the stairs,
a woman moaning.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.230
That kind of thing.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.392
But I'm sure it
was in his head.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.076
You have a nice day.
Have fun, kids.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.673
I don't like him.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.110
<i>So you won an award.</i>

28:08.200 --> 28:09.350
Uh, that's right.

28:09.440 --> 28:10.635
Salesman of the Year.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.791
Oh, hun...
Yeah, I...

28:14.160 --> 28:15.958
It was
a national competition, so...

28:16.400 --> 28:18.357
Uh, then it was
dinner with Buck Young,

28:18.440 --> 28:20.636
who's the head
of the whole deal
that gives the award.

28:20.760 --> 28:24.436
That was some spread.
I think we closed that
place down drinking.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.270
Uh, and I said,
"I'm still up for some fun."

28:27.400 --> 28:29.392
And Linda said she
wanted to go to bed.
I'm a morning person.

28:29.520 --> 28:32.274
Yeah, but then
I thought, "Heck...

28:33.240 --> 28:36.358
How often does something
like this happen.
Winning an award?"

28:36.440 --> 28:40.434
So, yeah, a nightcap,
just to celebrate.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.113
I told him to go.
Yeah.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.311
So, sure.
So I went to the bar.

28:44.720 --> 28:46.279
And this is the bar
at the hotel?

28:46.360 --> 28:50.354
Yes, sir.
Yes, ma'am.
Excuse me.

28:50.640 --> 28:53.872
Uh. The Royale,
I guess it's called.

28:54.280 --> 28:58.274
I ordered a drink,
I had a chat with
the bartender for a bit.

28:58.360 --> 28:59.680
Uh, male or female?

28:59.960 --> 29:02.191
Female. A woman.

29:02.280 --> 29:05.671
Uh, but, you know,
one drink and I'm back
upstairs to bed.

29:05.800 --> 29:08.838
And what happened
on the elevator?
Nothing.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.834
I mean, it went up.

29:15.080 --> 29:17.390
So everyone on the elevator
was alive when you got off.

29:18.440 --> 29:22.400
Oh, yeah, they sure were.
Uh, they were laughing
about something.

29:23.520 --> 29:26.877
Friday night in Vegas.
That is some place,
I tell ya.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.277
Linda and me,
we'd never been before.

29:30.360 --> 29:33.558
What I love most
are the fountains.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.957
Also, you can
gamble at the airport.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.749
Right.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.112
Well, I checked
and it looks like you

29:42.200 --> 29:43.759
changed your flight
at the last minute

29:43.840 --> 29:45.513
to come back on
the first flight.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.712
So, what was
the reason there?

29:51.480 --> 29:54.200
That was me...
My idea.

29:55.880 --> 29:58.918
I just...
I got homesick.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.753
Woke Lester up in
the middle of the night

30:00.840 --> 30:02.832
and told him did
we have to
stay another day,

30:02.920 --> 30:05.230
'cause I was ready
to go home.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.437
Yeah.
That's right.
That is right.

30:07.880 --> 30:14.320
Uh, remember? I said, "Babe,
the room is paid for
through till Sunday."

30:14.400 --> 30:16.551
But she was adamant.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.553
I tend to get my way.
Oh, boy, does she?

30:23.160 --> 30:27.791
Okay then. Well, uh,
thank you for your time,
Mr. Nygaard. Missus.

30:28.080 --> 30:29.480
When's the due date?

30:29.560 --> 30:31.711
Oh, I've got
a few weeks still.

30:32.600 --> 30:35.957
Uh, listen. Vegas PD
is gonna send over

30:36.040 --> 30:38.555
some pictures from
the hotel security camera.

30:38.640 --> 30:40.757
So don't leave
town for a while.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.196
I may have some
more questions for you.

30:43.320 --> 30:44.993
Oh, shoot.
We were gonna...

30:45.080 --> 30:46.719
No, absolutely,
absolutely.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.280
We'll be right here
if you need us.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.590
<i>Car four, come back.</i>

31:02.680 --> 31:04.160
<i>Car four, come back.</i>

31:04.240 --> 31:05.594
I'm coming.

31:06.440 --> 31:07.635
Yeah, this is four.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.717
<i>Hey, Molly,
a couple of FBI fellows</i>

31:09.800 --> 31:11.712
<i>came by the station
looking for you.</i>

31:11.800 --> 31:13.029
Oh, yeah?
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:13.120 --> 31:14.270
<i>Couldn't reach
you on the radio.</i>

31:14.360 --> 31:16.556
<i>Thought you'd
be at your dad's,
so I sent them there.</i>

31:16.640 --> 31:18.518
To the diner?
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:18.600 --> 31:20.193
<i>So you should
probably check in
on them.</i>

31:20.280 --> 31:21.839
<i>They seem real
eager to talk to you.</i>

31:21.920 --> 31:23.274
Okay then, will do.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.834
Coffee?

32:13.000 --> 32:14.434
Yeah. Decaf,
if you got it.

32:15.640 --> 32:16.790
And a piece of pie.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.800
I got apple and cherry.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.960
No good ever came
from a piece of cherry pie.

32:50.640 --> 32:51.756
Thanks, friend.

32:56.480 --> 32:57.880
Local PD?

33:00.120 --> 33:02.112
State cop, 18 years.

33:03.520 --> 33:04.795
You got the look.

33:07.640 --> 33:10.109
I spent some time
with the Tampa DA.

33:12.320 --> 33:13.515
Lawyer?

33:14.760 --> 33:16.080
Yeah, something like that.

33:20.280 --> 33:21.953
Say, you may be
able to help me.

33:23.360 --> 33:24.760
I will if I can.

33:25.560 --> 33:29.793
Uh, I'm in town for
not too much time,
just passing through, really.

33:30.240 --> 33:33.711
But I wanted to look up
my old pal, Lester Nygaard.

33:33.800 --> 33:34.995
Oh, sure,
I know Lester.

33:35.960 --> 33:37.599
Did you go by his shop?
Oh, first thing.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.558
But wouldn't you know it?
They're closed.

33:40.280 --> 33:44.320
Went by the house, too,
except it turns
out he's moved.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.312
No kidding.
Hmm.

33:46.840 --> 33:48.433
So you can see
my predicament.

33:49.520 --> 33:50.749
You tried calling him?

33:51.680 --> 33:55.276
Yeah, I could do that,
but I was hoping
to surprise him.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.270
That's a pickle.

34:00.800 --> 34:01.870
Yup.

34:13.159 --> 34:14.594
That your boy?

34:16.920 --> 34:19.913
In a way.
My daughter's
husband.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.320
They look happy.

34:27.080 --> 34:29.754
'Course, no one hangs
the sad pictures,
am I right?

34:31.280 --> 34:33.636
Mom crying and
dad looking angry.

34:34.880 --> 34:36.393
The kid with the black eye.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.877
How long did you
say you worked
for the Tampa DA?

34:44.440 --> 34:45.998
Oh, I didn't say
I worked there.

34:47.120 --> 34:51.672
Spent some time, that's all.
But that's just me.
I'm a traveler.

34:53.199 --> 34:55.157
<i>Big cities,
the small towns...</i>

34:57.160 --> 34:58.435
Open road.

34:59.400 --> 35:03.394
Which is why I thought,
"Here we are in a..."

35:03.480 --> 35:06.552
What do you call it,
"A tight-knit community."

35:07.640 --> 35:08.710
So, uh...

35:10.560 --> 35:11.880
Thought I'll just ask.

35:13.040 --> 35:18.718
So here I am,
asking you if you know
where I can find old Lester.

35:23.160 --> 35:26.870
Had a case once.
Back in '79.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.471
I'd tell you the details,
but it'd sound
like I made 'em up...

35:33.000 --> 35:34.400
Madness really.

35:40.480 --> 35:41.834
Bodies?

35:43.320 --> 35:46.950
Yes, sir...
One after another.

35:48.280 --> 35:51.990
Probably,
if you stacked 'em high

35:53.040 --> 35:54.918
you could have climbed
to the second floor.

35:57.560 --> 36:00.439
<i>Yeah, I saw
something that year...</i>

36:02.360 --> 36:05.432
<i>I ain't never seen
before or since.</i>

36:08.640 --> 36:10.120
I'd call it animal.

36:11.360 --> 36:15.673
Except animals
only kill for food.

36:17.600 --> 36:18.954
This was...

36:26.920 --> 36:29.992
Sioux Falls.
You ever been?

36:33.000 --> 36:36.516
Went to Sioux City once.
Back in my scandalous days.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.719
But anyway,
you didn't answer
my question there.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.036
Well, I tell ya what?

36:45.120 --> 36:47.510
You leave me your number,

36:47.640 --> 36:49.996
I'll make sure Lester gets it
next time he comes in.

36:50.080 --> 36:54.472
That's a solid offer, friend.
But like I said,
I'm just passing through.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.793
Thanks for
the pie and the coffee.

37:01.920 --> 37:05.436
I haven't had
a piece of pie like that
since the Garden of Eden.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.836
Hey, Dad.
Hey, hon.

37:21.480 --> 37:22.470
Everything okay?

37:23.600 --> 37:24.590
Oh, yeah.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.080
Sometimes you
just get a weird one.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.069
Well, I'm supposed
to meet a couple of
fellows from the...

37:31.720 --> 37:33.552
Never mind.
I see 'em.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.272
Hey there, I'm...
Deputy Solverson?

37:39.400 --> 37:40.595
That's right.

37:40.680 --> 37:43.798
I'm Agent Budge and
this is Agent Pepper,
FBI from Fargo.

37:43.880 --> 37:46.031
We went by the station.
They told us you'd be here.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.074
Am now.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.157
Should we grab a table?
Yeah.

37:58.920 --> 38:01.071
You made a phone
call to the field office

38:01.160 --> 38:03.356
yesterday about
the massacre last year.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.915
Said you know who shot up
the Syndicate building?

38:07.000 --> 38:09.310
Called seven times,
according to the file.

38:09.400 --> 38:10.914
Wouldn't take
no for an answer.

38:11.320 --> 38:12.879
I'm not clear on...

38:14.520 --> 38:16.591
The FBI sent
a fella already.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.032
He looked at my evidence
and said it was
circumstantial.

38:19.120 --> 38:21.589
A worker bee...
Or what do
the ants call them?

38:21.680 --> 38:23.751
A drone.
We're invested.

38:23.840 --> 38:26.071
Got a personal stake,
is what my partner...

38:26.160 --> 38:28.550
See, we were there
on the day at the Syndicate.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.835
Surveillance.

38:30.200 --> 38:33.830
Day 156, just logging
the comings and goings.

38:33.960 --> 38:36.600
Six months and
nothing happens.
Going crazy with...

38:36.680 --> 38:37.750
And then...

38:37.840 --> 38:41.959
So, you see,
we're invested
personally, like I said.

38:42.040 --> 38:44.430
And when
we heard you called...

38:44.520 --> 38:46.398
That you have
an answer.

38:46.480 --> 38:48.517
So please,
we have to know.

38:49.720 --> 38:50.870
Who is he?

38:57.240 --> 39:00.756
Um, Dad, I think
we're gonna need
some coffees to go.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.600
My God.

39:15.240 --> 39:18.119
You put all this
together yourself?
Oh, no.

39:19.120 --> 39:21.237
Gus helped me...
My husband.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.959
He used to be Duluth PD.
He's a mailman now.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.232
But you can see
why I think this is your guy.

39:30.080 --> 39:31.196
Okay, I'm here.

39:31.280 --> 39:32.555
Hey, Chief.
These fellas...

39:32.680 --> 39:33.909
Bill Oswalt.
I'm the chief here.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.469
Sorry I wasn't around to...
I was at a conference.

39:36.600 --> 39:40.116
And then Cindy called
and said there were
two agents from the FBI here.

39:40.280 --> 39:41.555
Oh, no.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.150
Now, Chief,
listen, before...

39:43.240 --> 39:44.754
No, no, no.
I am so sorry.

39:44.840 --> 39:48.470
I am so sorry.
Molly, these guys
aren't interested in...

39:50.360 --> 39:51.874
Let's meet in
my office.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.553
Have you seen this?

39:53.640 --> 39:55.233
Have I seen this?

39:55.600 --> 39:58.593
Son, this thing's been
giving me nightmares.

39:59.520 --> 40:00.795
Come on, now.
That's not fair.

40:01.720 --> 40:03.313
She did tell you
that we caught the guy

40:03.400 --> 40:04.914
responsible for
killing the wife?

40:05.000 --> 40:05.990
Didn't she?

40:06.800 --> 40:09.520
Uh, the brother Nygaard
and he had
the bloody hammer...

40:09.600 --> 40:12.160
So you don't care
about the fact

40:12.240 --> 40:17.156
that this Malvo character
was seen with Lester
at the hospital?

40:17.640 --> 40:21.680
Or that he ended up in Duluth
in direct conflict
with these other two?

40:23.160 --> 40:25.231
No, because that, uh...

40:25.360 --> 40:26.635
What happened in Duluth...

40:26.720 --> 40:29.838
I'm gonna call HQ
and let them know
we'll be staying the night.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.877
We can take another run
at Lester tomorrow.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.360
Is there a motel?

40:33.640 --> 40:36.314
Um, yeah, sure. I can...
I'll get you directions.

40:36.400 --> 40:40.030
This is tremendous work,
Deputy. Impressive.

40:50.680 --> 40:52.637
Yeah, I better just...

42:47.720 --> 42:49.393
Come on.

42:51.000 --> 42:51.990
Okay.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.271
All set. Ready to go?

42:55.360 --> 42:57.272
What? I thought
we weren't gonna go.

42:57.360 --> 42:59.272
Acapulco,
here we come.

42:59.360 --> 43:00.760
Oh, my God.

43:00.840 --> 43:02.877
You betcha.
I talked to the deputy.

43:02.960 --> 43:03.950
She said, "Sure, go."

43:04.040 --> 43:06.236
So now, we just gotta swing
by the office and
pick up the passports.

43:06.320 --> 43:07.720
What about my coat?

43:07.800 --> 43:10.269
Oh, you're not gonna
need a winter coat
where we're going.

43:17.560 --> 43:20.280
You know I had
a crush on you
right from when we met.

43:20.800 --> 43:21.995
Hmm.

43:23.480 --> 43:24.834
Oh, yeah?

43:24.920 --> 43:26.479
Swear to God.

43:27.480 --> 43:28.630
Used to sit at my desk

43:28.720 --> 43:31.280
and dream about
you leaving your wife

43:31.400 --> 43:33.995
or somehow getting
her out of the picture.

43:37.360 --> 43:39.750
Not that I wanted...
No, of course not.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.030
Nothing wrong
with dreaming.

43:43.360 --> 43:46.159
Oh, I agree...
Like Cinderella.

43:46.240 --> 43:47.230
Yeah?

43:48.720 --> 43:50.552
I remember when
I was three.

43:50.640 --> 43:52.711
And I told you
how we came
over to America,

43:52.800 --> 43:55.713
settled in Minnesota,
my folks bought the motel?

43:56.400 --> 43:57.470
Yeah?

43:57.560 --> 43:59.313
Well, they put me
right to work.

43:59.400 --> 44:02.438
Just...
Laundry at first...

44:03.640 --> 44:06.553
Then making the beds
and cleaning the rooms.

44:07.960 --> 44:10.759
You don't even
wanna know the disarray
people leave behind.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.075
I bet.

44:12.560 --> 44:15.359
One time...
I'll never forget this.

44:15.560 --> 44:18.439
I was changing the sheets
on a king size, and I'm...

44:20.000 --> 44:22.560
Suddenly, I'm like,
"What's that smell?"

44:23.080 --> 44:25.231
Well, the guest had...

44:25.640 --> 44:30.635
He made a BM between
the mattress and
the box spring.

44:33.560 --> 44:34.710
What?

44:34.800 --> 44:37.952
I guess he took
the mattress off
and did it,

44:38.520 --> 44:40.591
and then made
the bed back up,
which...

44:40.760 --> 44:43.400
It's a lot simpler
just to go to the toilet.

44:47.920 --> 44:49.752
My point being...

44:50.600 --> 44:54.913
That while I was cleaning up
I had this dream that someone,

44:55.000 --> 45:00.280
a man... Would come
along and take me
away from all this.

45:00.840 --> 45:02.354
And then I met you.

45:03.520 --> 45:04.954
And here we are.

45:05.520 --> 45:07.512
And we're going
to Acapulco.

45:51.480 --> 45:53.073
I thought we were
going to the shop?

45:53.160 --> 45:54.674
We are.

45:54.760 --> 45:57.514
You know how icy it
gets right out front.

46:29.040 --> 46:30.269
Lester?

46:34.360 --> 46:36.079
You know I hate
to do this, but...

46:37.200 --> 46:39.192
I kind of
tweaked my back before,

46:39.280 --> 46:41.112
getting the luggage
out of the car.

46:41.200 --> 46:42.395
Oh, you poor baby.

46:42.480 --> 46:44.631
So do you think
you could run in?

46:44.720 --> 46:47.360
The passports are
in the safe. There's
some cash in there too.

46:48.240 --> 46:51.039
Can you...
Will you do that for me?

46:51.160 --> 46:52.879
Of course, hon.
Thanks.

46:56.920 --> 46:57.990
Linda?

46:59.480 --> 47:00.470
Hmm.

47:01.680 --> 47:03.478
It's cold out there.

47:03.600 --> 47:05.398
You're sweet.

47:15.200 --> 47:16.429
Oh, uh.

47:17.640 --> 47:19.120
Put your hood up, huh?

47:19.800 --> 47:21.996
I'd hate for your
pretty face to freeze.
