00:36.033 --> 00:37.967
[cheers and applause]

00:40.200 --> 00:42.967
- Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:42.967 --> 00:44.066
I'm John Oliver.

00:44.066 --> 00:46.567
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:46.567 --> 00:48.567
Just time for a quick recap
of the week,

00:48.567 --> 00:50.533
and we begin with
the continuing investigation

00:50.533 --> 00:53.367
of Donald Trump and Russia,
a scandal that we've been

00:53.367 --> 00:55.734
referring to as
"Stupid Watergate,"

00:55.734 --> 00:58.533
because it has all the potential
consequences of Watergate,

00:58.533 --> 01:01.900
but everyone involved
is really stupid.

01:01.900 --> 01:04.767
This week, the news centered
on Congressman Devin Nunes,

01:04.767 --> 01:08.367
the most Devin Devin
in the history of Devins.

01:08.367 --> 01:10.500
His parents actually wanted
to name him something else,

01:10.500 --> 01:14.033
but the birth certificate
just wrote "Devin" on itself.

01:14.033 --> 01:16.133
You may remember,
last week he made headlines

01:16.133 --> 01:18.333
with a seemingly huge claim.

01:18.333 --> 01:21.400
- Congressman Devin Nunes
dropped a bombshell today.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.667
He said President Trump's
transition team

01:23.667 --> 01:26.600
and the president's personal
communications may have been

01:26.600 --> 01:29.433
caught up in, quote,
"incidental surveillance."

01:29.433 --> 01:31.533
- Now, that initially
sounded like it could

01:31.533 --> 01:34.633
back up Trump's claims that
President Obama wiretapped him,

01:34.633 --> 01:35.867
but it quickly unraveled,

01:35.867 --> 01:38.667
as Nunes conceded
the surveillance was routine,

01:38.667 --> 01:40.266
appeared to be completely legal,

01:40.266 --> 01:41.934
occurred after the election,

01:41.934 --> 01:43.567
and may not have
even targeted Trump

01:43.567 --> 01:45.266
or his transition team,
but rather

01:45.266 --> 01:47.200
foreign individuals
discussing the transition.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.834
And yet despite that,

01:48.834 --> 01:50.967
Trump claimed the evidence
had left him feeling

01:50.967 --> 01:54.266
"somewhat vindicated,"
which is not really surprising.

01:54.266 --> 01:57.200
Trump feels vindicated by
dubious sources all the time.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.000
"We don't need to invest
in clean energy.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.266
It says right here on the cup
that 'America Runs on Dunkin'."

02:03.266 --> 02:07.200
But there were many questions
this week surrounding Nunes,

02:07.200 --> 02:09.467
a man who looks like
the guy every 13-year-old

02:09.467 --> 02:12.367
wishes her mom
would stop dating.

02:12.367 --> 02:14.700
For instance, why did he make
such a big show

02:14.700 --> 02:16.633
of racing to the White House
to share his information

02:16.633 --> 02:17.734
with President Trump,

02:17.734 --> 02:19.934
especially in light
of this revelation?

02:19.934 --> 02:22.300
- "The New York Times"
reported White House officials

02:22.300 --> 02:24.266
were the source
of intelligence reports

02:24.266 --> 02:26.834
given to House Intelligence
Chair Devin Nunes.

02:26.834 --> 02:29.233
- Okay, so to recap.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.600
Devin took what appears to be
an unnecessary trip

02:31.600 --> 02:33.633
to tell what appears to be
unimportant news

02:33.633 --> 02:36.734
to what may have been
the source of the news itself.

02:36.734 --> 02:38.934
So what Nunes brought to light
has turned out to be

02:38.934 --> 02:40.500
a bunch of smoke and mirrors

02:40.500 --> 02:42.300
as convoluted
as it is pointless.

02:42.300 --> 02:45.900
Truly, it is the
"Now You See Me" of revelations.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.033
But wait, wait,
because Stupid Watergate

02:48.033 --> 02:50.333
found a way to get
even stupider,

02:50.333 --> 02:52.467
because the surveillance
Nunes was studying

02:52.467 --> 02:53.900
concerned the Trump
transition team,

02:53.900 --> 02:56.467
of which one member was,
yeah, you guessed it,

02:56.467 --> 02:58.934
Devin fucking Nunes.

02:58.934 --> 03:01.633
Which seems like a pretty clear
conflict of interest.

03:01.633 --> 03:03.600
So it was important for
Republicans to make clear

03:03.600 --> 03:06.900
just how independent he is
from the White House,

03:06.900 --> 03:09.767
but they couldn't even
do that properly.

03:09.767 --> 03:11.834
- You have to keep in mind
who he works for.

03:11.834 --> 03:13.700
He works for the president.
He answers to the president.

03:13.700 --> 03:14.767
- Does he or does he work

03:14.767 --> 03:16.867
the constituents
of his district?

03:16.867 --> 03:18.533
- Well, you do both.

03:18.533 --> 03:19.867
- No!

03:19.867 --> 03:22.467
No, You absolutely do not!

03:22.467 --> 03:25.800
You do one of them
and explicitly not the other.

03:25.800 --> 03:29.233
That is literally
the whole point of Congress.

03:29.233 --> 03:32.800
And that is why this story
is Stupid Watergate.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.934
It could very
well take down the government,

03:34.934 --> 03:38.300
but nobody involved understands
why, or how to cover it up,

03:38.300 --> 03:40.166
or what the government
fucking is,

03:40.166 --> 03:41.633
or possibly how to breathe

03:41.633 --> 03:44.100
without getting
regular reminders.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.867
So for now let's move
on to the United Kingdom,

03:46.867 --> 03:48.767
the country whose
most beloved children's book

03:48.767 --> 03:50.000
is about friendless child

03:50.000 --> 03:51.533
who thinks a bear
with an eating disorder

03:51.533 --> 03:54.633
and a depressed donkey
are talking to him.

03:54.633 --> 03:58.734
It has been almost a year since
the UK voted to leave the EU,

03:58.734 --> 04:01.767
and the process of doing that
began this Wednesday.

04:01.767 --> 04:04.100
- In accordance with the wishes
of the British people,

04:04.100 --> 04:07.266
the United Kingdom is
leaving the European Union.

04:07.266 --> 04:09.533
[subdued cheering]

04:09.533 --> 04:12.233
This is an historic moment

04:12.233 --> 04:15.133
from which there can be
no turning back.

04:15.133 --> 04:19.734
- Wow, the electricity
in that room is palpable.

04:19.734 --> 04:21.934
Even her phrasing is ominous,
though.

04:21.934 --> 04:25.400
"A historic moment from which
there can be no turning back,"

04:25.400 --> 04:29.066
could just as easily apply to
getting a Limp Bizkit tattoo,

04:29.066 --> 04:33.100
or the moment after your cult
drank their suicide potions.

04:33.100 --> 04:37.000
The UK has now initiated
Article 50 of the EU treaty,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.533
triggering a two-year
negotiating process,

04:39.533 --> 04:42.967
leading up to a withdrawal
from the EU in March of 2019.

04:42.967 --> 04:45.800
So we're facing 24 months
of promising to pull out,

04:45.800 --> 04:48.800
or as Sting calls it,
a one-night stand.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.667
Now, it was initiated,
this process,

04:50.667 --> 04:52.233
by hand-delivering a letter

04:52.233 --> 04:54.066
to the President
of the European Council,

04:54.066 --> 04:56.734
which began,
"Dear President Tusk."

04:56.734 --> 04:59.233
Which really should be
the start of a letter you write

04:59.233 --> 05:01.333
to a walrus president,

05:01.333 --> 05:03.233
but sadly
it was a breakup letter

05:03.233 --> 05:05.433
to an actual person
named Donald Tusk,

05:05.433 --> 05:08.033
who seemed understandably
devastated.

05:08.033 --> 05:12.600
- There's no reason to pretend
that this is a happy day,

05:12.600 --> 05:14.600
neither in Brussels
nor in London.

05:14.600 --> 05:19.400
What--what can I add to this?

05:19.400 --> 05:22.200
We--we already miss you.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.600
Thank you and good-bye.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.200
- Oh, come on, Tusky!

05:26.200 --> 05:27.967
Don't be sad!

05:27.967 --> 05:30.533
If it helps,
you will get over Britain.

05:30.533 --> 05:32.400
And if you do ever
find yourself missing it,

05:32.400 --> 05:34.033
here's what works for me.

05:34.033 --> 05:36.000
Just stare at this picture
of an angry old woman

05:36.000 --> 05:38.533
in a racist T-shirt eating
beans on toast in the rain,

05:38.533 --> 05:42.166
because that is what you're
actually leaving behind.

05:42.166 --> 05:44.734
Although, to be fair,
not everybody was gloomy

05:44.734 --> 05:46.033
about the news this week.

05:46.033 --> 05:48.667
Take Nigel Farage,
former UKIP leader

05:48.667 --> 05:52.066
and current spokesmodel
for Smug Dickhead Moisturizer.

05:52.066 --> 05:55.200
The moisturizer that gives you
that smug dickhead glow.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.633
He was absolutely thrilled.

05:57.633 --> 06:01.266
- Today's the day for me,
after 25 years of campaigning,

06:01.266 --> 06:02.800
that the impossible dream
came true.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.000
I'm delighted.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.200
- Well, that is
genuinely horrible.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.233
Because, and you really
should know this,

06:08.233 --> 06:10.667
every time one of
Nigel Farage's dreams come true,

06:10.667 --> 06:14.467
somewhere in the world,
an angel gets diarrhea.

06:14.467 --> 06:17.567
The truth here is, though,
never mind leaving the EU.

06:17.567 --> 06:19.000
It is going to be really hard

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
for the UK
to keep itself together.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.266
This vote has divided
the British public.

06:23.266 --> 06:25.033
The BBC even chose to illustrate

06:25.033 --> 06:26.500
this division
among Britain's citizens

06:26.500 --> 06:29.700
with a not entirely
dignified visual aid.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.500
- So how does our jury feel
about triggering Article 50?

06:32.500 --> 06:34.867
We gave them emoji paddles:

06:34.867 --> 06:38.033
happy, unhappy,
or worried and confused.

06:38.033 --> 06:40.166
Please vote now.

06:40.166 --> 06:43.934
Four happy, three worried,
one unhappy.

06:43.934 --> 06:47.000
Our jury, and indeed Britain,
is deeply divided

06:47.000 --> 06:50.066
on its reaction to
the triggering of Article 50.

06:50.066 --> 06:52.367
- Now, I know that looks stupid,

06:52.367 --> 06:54.734
but honestly British people
are so emotionally repressed,

06:54.734 --> 06:56.333
emojis are actually
the best way

06:56.333 --> 06:58.667
to get a coherent sentiment
out of us.

06:58.667 --> 07:01.800
It's pretty much that,
or baking competitions.

07:01.800 --> 07:05.800
"Let this Victorian sponge cake
say what I never can.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.367
I'm collapsing inside."

07:08.367 --> 07:11.166
And with that in mind,
like many British people,

07:11.166 --> 07:13.033
I'm really struggling
to find the words

07:13.033 --> 07:14.800
for how difficult
and depressing

07:14.800 --> 07:16.200
the next two years
are going to be.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.900
So if I may try in emoji form.

07:18.900 --> 07:21.734
Europe is feeling
crying kitty cat at the moment,

07:21.734 --> 07:24.900
while Nigel Farage has
a full, throbbing eggplant.

07:24.900 --> 07:28.233
And I personally am hovering
between crying face and handgun,

07:28.233 --> 07:30.834
because it seems
our best-case scenario

07:30.834 --> 07:33.600
is to just pray emoji
that this does not turn into

07:33.600 --> 07:35.867
a flaming pile of shit.

07:35.867 --> 07:37.800
And now, this.

07:43.934 --> 07:46.700
- If I pinched your butt,
would you call police?

07:46.700 --> 07:48.433
The answer is no.

07:48.433 --> 07:49.967
I'll answer for you, Mr. Rose.

07:49.967 --> 07:51.834
- Would you pinch my butt,
is the question.

07:51.834 --> 07:53.300
- We're pro-love on
"CBS This Morning."

07:53.300 --> 07:54.533
- Pro-love, yes we are.

07:54.533 --> 07:56.100
- The news is back
and so is love.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.700
- So is love.
- Love and sex are here.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.633
- Whoa, okay.
You just went there.

07:59.633 --> 08:01.066
- You should see what I'm
wearing underneath this dress.

08:01.066 --> 08:02.500
- Ah-ha!

08:02.500 --> 08:04.700
- You should see what Charlie
wears underneath his shirt.

08:04.700 --> 08:05.900
- Whoo!

08:05.900 --> 08:08.367
Norah, it's getting
hot in here!

08:08.367 --> 08:09.700
- Norah knows.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.900
- There ain't nothing shrinking
about Charlie Rose.

08:11.900 --> 08:14.767
- Brain, nope.
Brain ain't shrinking.

08:14.767 --> 08:16.800
I could say something else,
but I'm not.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.400
- You want me to just
be around you more?

08:18.400 --> 08:19.834
- Yeah, be around, yeah.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.333
- I can do that.
- I could get more done.

08:21.333 --> 08:24.200
I love you.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.700
- So Charlie, what time should
Gayle and I come over tonight?

08:26.700 --> 08:27.700
- Well, whenever.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.000
- Do you want us
to bring anything

08:29.000 --> 08:30.500
or will dinner be served?

08:30.500 --> 08:31.734
- Do you remember
the answer last year?

08:31.734 --> 08:33.900
It was bring your sister?
Remember?

08:33.900 --> 08:36.333
- I think I need to go on a boat
with Mr. Charlie Rose, Gayle.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.266
All right.
- I'm game.

08:38.266 --> 08:40.000
- Me too.
- Yeah, I'm game.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.367
- Me too.
- Oh, boy, this is why

08:41.367 --> 08:43.800
I'm the luckiest man in
the world, right here.

08:47.033 --> 08:48.900
- Moving on,
our main story tonight

08:48.900 --> 08:50.400
concerns marijuana.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.700
Basically, catnip for people.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.734
It has gained increasing
acceptance in recent years.

08:55.734 --> 08:58.033
In fact, one small bright spot
on election night

08:58.033 --> 09:01.567
was pro-marijuana referenda
passing in eight states.

09:01.567 --> 09:03.266
- It's official!

09:03.266 --> 09:04.734
[cheering and applauding]

09:04.734 --> 09:06.900
- A big win
for lovers of weed.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.333
[cheering]

09:08.333 --> 09:09.800
- Well, we are really excited.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.567
I mean, this is a huge victory,
not just for Californians,

09:12.567 --> 09:14.934
but for really the country
and the world.

09:14.934 --> 09:17.000
- Everybody here should be
so excited by this.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.567
- It's a little weird
that those celebrations happened

09:20.567 --> 09:22.900
the same night
that Trump was elected.

09:22.900 --> 09:25.467
It's like celebrating your
baseball team winning

09:25.467 --> 09:28.166
on the deck
of the sinking "Titanic."

09:28.166 --> 09:30.133
"Bit of a mixed bag today,
but still,

09:30.133 --> 09:32.633
Go Sox!
Yankees suck!"

09:32.633 --> 09:37.233
Now as it stands,
44 states now have some form

09:37.233 --> 09:38.433
of medical marijuana law,

09:38.433 --> 09:40.467
and eight have laws
allowing recreational use,

09:40.467 --> 09:41.767
and that is good news.

09:41.767 --> 09:44.000
The war on drugs
was futile, expensive,

09:44.000 --> 09:45.867
and imposed
overly-harsh penalties,

09:45.867 --> 09:48.800
especially on African-Americans,
who police data suggest

09:48.800 --> 09:51.567
are over four times
more likely to be arrested

09:51.567 --> 09:53.066
for marijuana possession.

09:53.066 --> 09:55.533
Although interestingly,
white people are a million times

09:55.533 --> 09:58.433
more likely to be shocked
by that statistic.

09:58.433 --> 10:02.400
And this is clearly
no longer a fringe issue.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.767
- In 1969, a Gallup poll showed

10:04.767 --> 10:07.266
12% favored legalization.

10:07.266 --> 10:09.600
Today it's 60%.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.467
- Exactly,
marijuana is something

10:11.467 --> 10:13.934
we've just all
gradually decided is okay.

10:13.934 --> 10:17.567
Like Mark Wahlberg
as a serious actor.

10:17.567 --> 10:19.934
You know what...sure.

10:19.934 --> 10:22.333
I've decided I'm fine with that.

10:22.333 --> 10:24.333
But the legality of marijuana

10:24.333 --> 10:26.333
is actually much more fraught
than you may think.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.700
In fact, if you have
marijuana right now,

10:28.700 --> 10:30.900
even if you're acting
completely legally

10:30.900 --> 10:32.266
according to your state,

10:32.266 --> 10:34.367
you may still be
in serious jeopardy,

10:34.367 --> 10:37.133
and that's not your
weed-induced paranoia talking.

10:37.133 --> 10:40.800
You could lose your home,
job, or possessions, Greg.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.233
And yeah, I know
I'm freaking the shit

10:43.233 --> 10:46.467
out of any stoned
viewer named Greg right now.

10:46.467 --> 10:48.100
But that is not a bad thing,

10:48.100 --> 10:51.300
because this story is genuinely
worth worrying about.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.734
And let's begin with
going back to why marijuana

10:53.734 --> 10:55.767
is so heavily regulated
in the first place.

10:55.767 --> 10:57.934
It was legal at the start
of the 20th century,

10:57.934 --> 10:59.333
but anti-drug hysteria,

10:59.333 --> 11:01.367
fueled partly
by racist stereotypes

11:01.367 --> 11:02.800
about who was using it,

11:02.800 --> 11:05.066
led to it being gradually
outlawed around the country.

11:05.066 --> 11:07.500
And naturally,
it was Richard Nixon,

11:07.500 --> 11:10.834
the Mozart of
racially motivated lawmaking,

11:10.834 --> 11:13.033
who targeted it
in his "War on Drugs,"

11:13.033 --> 11:14.667
for reasons
that he was open about,

11:14.667 --> 11:18.300
in conversations
he inexplicably recorded.

11:38.967 --> 11:41.500
Yes. Yes.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.100
Quick historical footnote.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.633
You know who
he's talking to there?

11:44.633 --> 11:46.433
Billy Bush, yeah.

11:46.433 --> 11:48.934
Turns out people just
open up to that guy!

11:48.934 --> 11:50.834
Always have.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.400
Now, Nixon--

11:52.400 --> 11:55.200
Nixon signed the Controlled
Substances Act in 1970,

11:55.200 --> 11:56.633
and it's
still in effect today.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.767
Marijuana is classified as
a Schedule I drug,

11:59.767 --> 12:02.533
the highest classification,
alongside heroin.

12:02.533 --> 12:04.500
Schedule II, a step down,

12:04.500 --> 12:07.533
features drugs like cocaine
and methamphetamine.

12:07.533 --> 12:09.967
And marijuana
is not a Schedule I

12:09.967 --> 12:13.266
any more than a hedgehog
is an apex predator.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.333
You're not scaring anyone,
Roland.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.900
Get a tattoo.

12:17.900 --> 12:20.400
But that federal law
is constantly clashing

12:20.400 --> 12:22.934
with new state laws,
and it's causing big problems.

12:22.934 --> 12:25.066
For instance,
legal marijuana businesses

12:25.066 --> 12:26.700
have struggled
to get bank accounts,

12:26.700 --> 12:28.266
because at the federal level,

12:28.266 --> 12:30.767
they are still seen
as criminal enterprises.

12:30.767 --> 12:32.500
So if banks took their deposits,

12:32.500 --> 12:34.567
that could be considered
money-laundering.

12:34.567 --> 12:36.133
And this has meant
that businesses

12:36.133 --> 12:38.300
had to operate all-cash.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.500
- A hundred percent of
our revenue comes in cash.

12:40.500 --> 12:44.300
This is federal taxes
that we pay in cash.

12:44.300 --> 12:47.433
Also our payroll
when we pay all 12 employees,

12:47.433 --> 12:49.300
they're getting
envelopes of cash.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.033
These are state taxes.

12:51.033 --> 12:54.834
- That is a shitty way
to be forced to do business.

12:54.834 --> 12:57.633
On the suspicious scale,
"cash-stuffed envelopes"

12:57.633 --> 12:58.834
rank somewhere between

12:58.834 --> 13:01.367
"unfurled hundreds
dusted in white powder"

13:01.367 --> 13:05.633
and "a wad of damp ones
containing a single pubic hair."

13:05.633 --> 13:07.800
And if you are wondering
why he was talking

13:07.800 --> 13:09.533
about paying his federal taxes,

13:09.533 --> 13:12.233
yeah, amazingly,
under federal tax law,

13:12.233 --> 13:14.000
you must declare income

13:14.000 --> 13:16.367
even if the source of it
is illegal.

13:16.367 --> 13:18.433
The tax code
even has provisions like,

13:18.433 --> 13:21.900
"If you receive a bribe,
include it in your income"

13:21.900 --> 13:23.867
and, "If you steal property,

13:23.867 --> 13:26.567
you must report
its fair market value."

13:26.567 --> 13:29.934
Which seems such an obvious trap
to catch criminals,

13:29.934 --> 13:31.867
it should really be listed
on the form as,

13:31.867 --> 13:34.166
"This is a trap.
"Are you really this stupid?

13:34.166 --> 13:36.734
"Oh, my God, you're filling out
a federal form admitting guilt?

13:36.734 --> 13:39.633
Aren't you,
you dumb, dumb idiot?"

13:39.633 --> 13:42.433
So marijuana businesses
have all the tax liabilities

13:42.433 --> 13:43.600
of other businesses,

13:43.600 --> 13:46.900
but what they don't get
is one major advantage.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.433
- The agency bars them

13:48.433 --> 13:51.166
from making most
normal business deductions.

13:51.166 --> 13:56.033
- You know, you could end up
with a tax bill far more than,

13:56.033 --> 13:58.667
you know, any potential profit
you could ever make.

13:58.667 --> 14:01.834
- That's right, you can't
deduct certain expenses.

14:01.834 --> 14:03.133
And that can mean that you pay

14:03.133 --> 14:05.100
double the amount of tax
that you would

14:05.100 --> 14:06.700
if you were selling
any other product,

14:06.700 --> 14:08.100
and just think about that.

14:08.100 --> 14:10.400
That means the shop
where you bought your weed

14:10.400 --> 14:12.333
may pay double
the amount of taxes

14:12.333 --> 14:15.767
paid by the shop where you
ordered that shitty pizza, Greg.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.033
Yeah, I'm talking
to you again, Greg.

14:18.033 --> 14:21.667
I told you this was important.
Pay attention!

14:21.667 --> 14:24.300
And it is not just
businesses facing difficulties.

14:24.300 --> 14:25.467
It's customers, too.

14:25.467 --> 14:26.767
Just look at Brandon Coats,

14:26.767 --> 14:29.767
who was paralyzed from
a car accident as a teenager.

14:29.767 --> 14:32.233
Now, he had a prescription
for medical marijuana,

14:32.233 --> 14:34.633
but he was fired from his job
at the Dish Network

14:34.633 --> 14:36.734
after he failed a drug test.

14:36.734 --> 14:39.033
- What was it like for you
when they said,

14:39.033 --> 14:40.600
"We don't want you to
work here anymore?"

14:40.600 --> 14:41.967
- Well, it was devastating.

14:41.967 --> 14:45.900
I mean, it's hard enough for
somebody like me to get a job.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.867
People look at me like
they probably don't think

14:47.867 --> 14:50.734
that I can do what I can,
you know?

14:50.734 --> 14:54.633
- Did you think because you
had a medical-marijuana card,

14:54.633 --> 14:57.500
that you had license
to go ahead and use it?

14:57.500 --> 15:00.700
- Well, I was under
the impression that we had

15:00.700 --> 15:03.200
passed a law and
that we had made it legal.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.533
- Yeah,
it's frankly understandable

15:05.533 --> 15:06.967
that he thought he was
doing nothing wrong.

15:06.967 --> 15:08.734
The state
had given him a license

15:08.734 --> 15:10.500
to use medical marijuana
legally,

15:10.500 --> 15:12.033
and yet he got fired anyway.

15:12.033 --> 15:13.533
And also he couldn't turn

15:13.533 --> 15:15.266
to the Americans with
Disabilities Act for help,

15:15.266 --> 15:17.066
because that is a federal law

15:17.066 --> 15:19.066
and it doesn't protect
marijuana use.

15:19.066 --> 15:21.567
All of which is pretty
frustrating.

15:21.567 --> 15:23.800
That's like driving
exactly the speed limit

15:23.800 --> 15:25.967
and getting pulled over
by a cop who tells you,

15:25.967 --> 15:28.367
"Sorry, the federal
speed limit is three,

15:28.367 --> 15:30.734
"and the legal age
to drive is 62,

15:30.734 --> 15:32.333
"and also you have to be drunk.

15:32.333 --> 15:36.166
Surprise, you're fucking
under arrest now."

15:36.166 --> 15:38.734
And even if you are only
dealing with your government

15:38.734 --> 15:39.967
at the state level,

15:39.967 --> 15:41.867
decades of enforcing
anti-drug laws

15:41.867 --> 15:44.367
can result in local officials
making big mistakes,

15:44.367 --> 15:47.000
as two Michigan parents,
one of whom treated

15:47.000 --> 15:48.834
his epileptic seizures
with marijuana,

15:48.834 --> 15:51.233
discovered in 2013.

15:51.233 --> 15:52.900
- Steve and Maria Green
of Lansing

15:52.900 --> 15:55.100
helplessly watched as
their infant daughter, Bree,

15:55.100 --> 15:57.266
was taken from their care.
The reason given?

15:57.266 --> 15:59.633
The state-sanctioned
medical marijuana users' home

15:59.633 --> 16:01.834
was too dangerous
for their six-month old

16:01.834 --> 16:03.300
because of the plants inside.

16:03.300 --> 16:06.166
- It would place our residence

16:06.166 --> 16:08.934
at a higher rate
of armed robbery

16:08.934 --> 16:11.066
and therefore
was an imminent danger

16:11.066 --> 16:12.967
for my child to be removed.

16:12.967 --> 16:16.100
- That is just
completely absurd.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.033
"If you have valuable
items in your home,

16:18.033 --> 16:19.500
we might take your children."

16:19.500 --> 16:21.633
Although I will say, that's
gonna add some real excitement

16:21.633 --> 16:23.533
to "The Price is Right"
from now on.

16:23.533 --> 16:25.567
"Oh, I really want
that entertainment center,

16:25.567 --> 16:26.700
"but I love my kids.

16:26.700 --> 16:27.967
"Fuck it, sorry Tommy,

16:27.967 --> 16:30.133
"Daddy's going
for the plasma screen!

16:30.133 --> 16:33.333
It's a dream, son,
a dream of mine!"

16:33.333 --> 16:35.333
And look, I know
that some people will say,

16:35.333 --> 16:37.734
"Well, hold on, the medical
efficacy of marijuana

16:37.734 --> 16:40.100
needs a lot more study,"
and that is true.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.300
The problem is,
it's very difficult to do that,

16:43.300 --> 16:46.500
because again, federal laws
are standing in the way.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.500
To study marijuana,
you need approval

16:48.500 --> 16:50.700
from three different
federal agencies,

16:50.700 --> 16:52.066
which can take years.

16:52.066 --> 16:55.367
In fact, one scientist
was forced to wait six years

16:55.367 --> 16:57.867
just to begin studying
its effects on PTSD,

16:57.867 --> 16:59.600
which is a long time.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.567
I frankly wouldn't blame her
if she'd just said,

17:01.567 --> 17:03.834
"Fuck it, I'm studying,
'Does chocolate during sex

17:03.834 --> 17:05.800
"help red wine
make you lose weight?'

17:05.800 --> 17:09.500
At least that way I'll get
to go on 'The Today Show!'"

17:09.500 --> 17:12.700
And if you're conducting
a federally-approved study

17:12.700 --> 17:16.266
on marijuana, you can only
get it from one place.

17:16.266 --> 17:18.066
- Dr. Mahmoud ElSohly oversees

17:18.066 --> 17:20.867
the University of Mississippi's
Marijuana Project.

17:20.867 --> 17:24.133
Its mission: to aid law
enforcement and produce pot

17:24.133 --> 17:27.033
for federal study,
mostly related to addiction.

17:27.033 --> 17:28.333
- For all intents and purposes,

17:28.333 --> 17:31.000
you're the government's
sole producer of marijuana.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.133
- Correct.

17:32.133 --> 17:33.433
- It's true.

17:33.433 --> 17:36.166
The sole source of
government-sanctioned marijuana

17:36.166 --> 17:39.467
is that guy, at
the University of Mississippi.

17:39.467 --> 17:41.467
So please
update your stereotypes

17:41.467 --> 17:43.567
about the University
of Mississippi,

17:43.567 --> 17:45.967
which I believe
is the official slogan

17:45.967 --> 17:48.600
of the University
of Mississippi.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.767
And while researchers
wait for marijuana

17:50.767 --> 17:52.800
to study whether it
helps with PTSD,

17:52.800 --> 17:54.700
plenty of
veterans will tell you,

17:54.700 --> 17:56.433
it absolutely does.

17:56.433 --> 17:57.867
Take Danny Belcher.

17:57.867 --> 17:59.834
He's a Vietnam vet
who'd been prescribed

17:59.834 --> 18:02.000
a great deal of medication
for pain and depression,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.934
but, as he told the
Kentucky legislature in 2014,

18:04.934 --> 18:06.767
he found that
when he tried marijuana,

18:06.767 --> 18:08.867
it started really helping him.

18:08.867 --> 18:11.500
- I do have my bowl of pot
in my house,

18:11.500 --> 18:13.867
and if I wake up at night
and had a nightmare,

18:13.867 --> 18:16.300
when I'm
wringing wet with sweat...

18:21.767 --> 18:24.233
and I see Kramer,
his dead body,

18:24.233 --> 18:26.400
Rodriguez, his dead body...

18:26.400 --> 18:29.767
If that nightmare gets so bad
I can't wake up

18:29.767 --> 18:32.066
and realize it's
just a nightmare,

18:32.066 --> 18:35.533
I will light that pipe up,
I'll be a criminal,

18:35.533 --> 18:37.200
I'll go back to sleep.

18:37.200 --> 18:41.633
But next morning, I will get up
at 6:00 like I always do,

18:41.633 --> 18:44.500
my four days a week
I go to the gym, I run.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.567
I help other veterans.

18:46.567 --> 18:49.834
I couldn't do that if I was on
the damn drugs the VA had me on.

18:49.834 --> 18:51.333
- Exactly.

18:51.333 --> 18:53.300
So for all the talk
you hear of marijuana

18:53.300 --> 18:55.233
being a "gateway drug,"
in his case,

18:55.233 --> 18:57.100
that gateway
led to peaceful sleep,

18:57.100 --> 18:59.834
rigorous exercise,
and community service.

18:59.834 --> 19:02.233
Pretty nice fucking gate
it turns out.

19:02.233 --> 19:05.367
Nice one to walk through,
if you get the chance.

19:05.367 --> 19:06.567
Now, you may have noticed

19:06.567 --> 19:08.600
that he said he's acting
like a criminal there,

19:08.600 --> 19:11.000
which is a little odd,
because Kentucky actually has

19:11.000 --> 19:13.233
a medical marijuana law
on the books.

19:13.233 --> 19:17.300
But the shortcomings of that
law touch on many of the reasons

19:17.300 --> 19:18.767
why "legal marijuana"

19:18.767 --> 19:21.166
can actually be
a bit of a gray area.

19:21.166 --> 19:23.333
For a start, Kentucky's law
has many restrictions.

19:23.333 --> 19:25.600
It only applies
to one marijuana product,

19:25.600 --> 19:28.967
and it requires a written order,
or a prescription,

19:28.967 --> 19:30.700
and that is a real problem.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.400
Because under federal law,
it is technically illegal

19:33.400 --> 19:36.433
for any doctor to write you
a prescription for marijuana.

19:36.433 --> 19:39.467
Now so most states, they get
around that by just calling

19:39.467 --> 19:41.333
for a recommendation
or certification,

19:41.333 --> 19:42.767
which doctors can give you.

19:42.767 --> 19:45.033
But even if Kentucky's
law did that,

19:45.033 --> 19:47.633
if Danny went to his
doctors at the VA,

19:47.633 --> 19:49.033
they couldn't
give him anything,

19:49.033 --> 19:51.033
because they're
a federal hospital.

19:51.033 --> 19:53.400
And federal policy
prohibits VA doctors

19:53.400 --> 19:55.166
from even recommending
marijuana,

19:55.166 --> 19:56.834
regardless of state law

19:56.834 --> 19:58.667
and regardless
of their medical opinion,

19:58.667 --> 20:00.533
which again is a bit weird.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.433
A doctor shouldn't be ignored
because he recommends marijuana.

20:03.433 --> 20:06.433
A doctor should only be ignored
because he's televised.

20:06.433 --> 20:08.000
We all agree on that.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.200
We're all on the same page
on that one, I think.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.300
[cheers and applause]

20:12.300 --> 20:14.867
But here's the thing,
it gets worse.

20:14.867 --> 20:16.800
Even if Danny
had a private doctor,

20:16.800 --> 20:18.700
and Kentucky rewrote its law,

20:18.700 --> 20:20.667
where would he get
marijuana from?

20:20.667 --> 20:23.633
Because Kentucky's law also
neglected to set up any system

20:23.633 --> 20:25.667
for legal marijuana
distribution.

20:25.667 --> 20:28.266
So he'd have to obtain it
from somewhere else.

20:28.266 --> 20:30.767
But where would he do that,
and how?

20:30.767 --> 20:32.500
Now he could have it shipped,
right?

20:32.500 --> 20:33.767
Except, no.

20:33.767 --> 20:35.333
That would be a federal crime.

20:35.333 --> 20:36.734
But what if he flew to a state

20:36.734 --> 20:38.567
where marijuana is
completely legal,

20:38.567 --> 20:40.400
and just brought it back
to Kentucky?

20:40.400 --> 20:41.633
Here's the thing, no again.

20:41.633 --> 20:43.266
That is also a federal crime.

20:43.266 --> 20:45.066
Could he drive
to a neighboring state

20:45.066 --> 20:46.266
to get what he needs?

20:46.266 --> 20:48.667
Unfortunately, no,
because two of those states

20:48.667 --> 20:50.533
have total
prohibitions on marijuana,

20:50.533 --> 20:53.567
and the rest don't currently
recognize out-of-state patients.

20:53.567 --> 20:55.133
Now, if you're thinking,
well, hold on,

20:55.133 --> 20:57.000
could he train
a carrier pigeon

20:57.000 --> 21:00.233
to carry the pot
from Colorado?

21:00.233 --> 21:02.400
Yes, that's good idea,

21:02.400 --> 21:04.266
and cool bird stamp.

21:04.266 --> 21:08.266
But--but as
a practical matter there,

21:08.266 --> 21:11.633
no, partly because it's illegal
and partly because you know

21:11.633 --> 21:13.567
the bird will eat it
on the way,

21:13.567 --> 21:16.200
stop flying, and spend
the whole night giggling

21:16.200 --> 21:20.467
about how owls seem like
they have glasses but, like,

21:20.467 --> 21:22.834
don't have glasses.

21:22.834 --> 21:26.000
And that's crazy, right?

21:26.000 --> 21:29.600
They don't know,
but it's there, right?

21:31.734 --> 21:34.567
The point is,
if you live in Kentucky,

21:34.567 --> 21:37.166
despite there being a law
that ostensibly gives access

21:37.166 --> 21:39.700
to medical marijuana,
there's virtually no legal way

21:39.700 --> 21:40.800
for you to get it.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.100
Now, things
fractionally improved

21:43.100 --> 21:44.900
toward the end of
the Obama administration,

21:44.900 --> 21:47.633
because his general attitude
was essentially this...

21:47.633 --> 21:51.567
- We still have federal laws
that classify marijuana

21:51.567 --> 21:54.200
as an illegal substance,

21:54.200 --> 21:59.867
but we're not going to
spend a lot of resources

21:59.867 --> 22:02.533
trying to turn back decisions
that have been made

22:02.533 --> 22:04.000
at the state level
on this issue.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
- Right.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.900
His attitude to pot
was basically,

22:06.900 --> 22:08.400
"I'm not gonna
hassle you over this

22:08.400 --> 22:10.033
unless you make me."

22:10.033 --> 22:12.467
Essentially, the same policy
as a security guard

22:12.467 --> 22:15.133
at a Dave Matthews concert.

22:15.133 --> 22:18.066
And his administration issued
guidelines in that spirit.

22:18.066 --> 22:20.433
By the end of his term,
it was actually a little easier

22:20.433 --> 22:21.667
to study marijuana

22:21.667 --> 22:23.166
and for dispensaries
to get bank accounts.

22:23.166 --> 22:26.066
But those guidelines
weren't permanent,

22:26.066 --> 22:28.033
and that could be
a real problem.

22:28.033 --> 22:30.834
Because our new Attorney General
is Jeff Sessions,

22:30.834 --> 22:34.200
the concept of golf
expressed in man-form,

22:34.200 --> 22:38.967
and he--he has been pretty clear
where he stands on marijuana.

22:38.967 --> 22:41.700
- This is not
a non-dangerous drug.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.000
This drug is dangerous.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.367
You cannot play with it.

22:44.367 --> 22:45.533
It's not funny.

22:45.533 --> 22:47.567
It's not something
to laugh about.

22:47.567 --> 22:51.266
And trying to send
that message with clarity,

22:51.266 --> 22:54.133
that good people
don't smoke marijuana.

22:54.133 --> 22:56.767
Well, Lady Gaga said
she's addicted to it,

22:56.767 --> 22:58.266
and it is not harmless.

22:58.266 --> 23:01.066
- Yeah, okay, Jeff.

23:01.066 --> 23:02.734
But Lady Gaga also said,

23:02.734 --> 23:04.133
"I believe that men and women

23:04.133 --> 23:05.667
deserve to love
each other equally,"

23:05.667 --> 23:07.467
as well as,
"Touch me in the dark.

23:07.467 --> 23:09.934
Put your hands
all over my body parts."

23:09.934 --> 23:11.934
So please, Jeff, if you're
going to live your life

23:11.934 --> 23:16.367
according to Gaga quotes,
accept the entire canon.

23:16.367 --> 23:18.300
And listen, I'm not
saying there shouldn't be laws

23:18.300 --> 23:20.500
that place sensible
restrictions on marijuana,

23:20.500 --> 23:22.100
as there are
with other substances,

23:22.100 --> 23:25.567
but our federal laws desperately
need to be brought up to date.

23:25.567 --> 23:28.633
And perhaps there's no clearer
sense of just how establishment

23:28.633 --> 23:31.166
that view is becoming than this.

23:31.166 --> 23:33.300
- The Cannabis Caucus
is a bipartisan effort

23:33.300 --> 23:35.133
to protect
state marijuana laws

23:35.133 --> 23:38.033
and blow out outdated
federal prohibitions on weed.

23:38.033 --> 23:40.266
Believe it or not,
these are the guys pushing

23:40.266 --> 23:43.000
for legalized pot in Congress.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.433
- Yes, there is now
a Cannabis Caucus in D.C.,

23:47.433 --> 23:50.967
and it's co-chaired
by these four narcs.

23:50.967 --> 23:54.233
And if even an 83-year-old
Republican from Alaska

23:54.233 --> 23:55.533
has come around
on this issue,

23:55.533 --> 23:57.934
then it's probably time
for our laws to catch up.

23:57.934 --> 23:59.867
And there are
a bunch of ideas out there.

23:59.867 --> 24:02.800
One bill proposed just this
week would remove marijuana

24:02.800 --> 24:04.100
from the Controlled
Substances Act,

24:04.100 --> 24:05.767
and officially re-name the ATF,

24:05.767 --> 24:08.467
the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Marijuana,

24:08.467 --> 24:11.500
Firearms and Explosives,
which does really make sense.

24:11.500 --> 24:14.700
Just get all the awesome stuff
together in one place.

24:14.700 --> 24:16.467
In fact, why not
keep going and make it

24:16.467 --> 24:18.200
the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Marijuana,

24:18.200 --> 24:20.533
Firearms, Explosives,
Monster Trucks,

24:20.533 --> 24:22.033
Motorcycle Jumps,

24:22.033 --> 24:24.734
and Sick-Ass Leather Jackets
with Tigers on Them.

24:24.734 --> 24:26.100
And by the way,

24:26.100 --> 24:29.300
that jacket is even
sicker in person.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.300
This is my jacket!

24:31.300 --> 24:33.867
This was me this morning!

24:33.867 --> 24:37.867
This is an actual
$6,000 Gucci jacket,

24:37.867 --> 24:40.934
and for anyone stupid
enough to buy one of these,

24:40.934 --> 24:43.200
it's worthless now!

24:43.200 --> 24:48.533
I just made your jacket uncool
and worthless by wearing it!

24:48.533 --> 24:51.266
But that bill
is just one proposal.

24:51.266 --> 24:53.867
Fixing all of this
is a huge undertaking.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.734
Marijuana laws
affect everything

24:55.734 --> 24:58.300
from environmental regulations
to international treaties,

24:58.300 --> 25:01.233
and ideally we should also
go back and expunge records

25:01.233 --> 25:04.900
of people convicted of low-level
marijuana offenses in the past.

25:04.900 --> 25:07.467
And all of this, I know,
is a lot of work,

25:07.467 --> 25:10.400
which is why we should
really start right now.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.266
Because I would argue
that it's absolutely worth it,

25:13.266 --> 25:15.000
for people like Brandon Coats,

25:15.000 --> 25:16.700
and for people
like Danny Belcher,

25:16.700 --> 25:19.100
and perhaps most of all,
for Greg,

25:19.100 --> 25:22.400
who has been freaking
the fuck out this whole time.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.000
I can see you, Greg,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.934
and I can hear your thoughts.

25:26.934 --> 25:28.700
And now, this.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.533
- Can I do a little bit of
the Marilyn Monroe?

25:37.533 --> 25:39.166
- Yep.
- Oh, please, do.

25:39.166 --> 25:41.633
- Can I go over to you?
- Yes.

25:41.633 --> 25:46.934
- ♪ Happy birthday

25:46.934 --> 25:48.800

- He knows what he's doing.

25:50.700 --> 25:52.800
- Yeah, wow.

♪ Happy birthday ♪

25:58.000 --> 26:02.100

26:08.000 --> 26:09.967
- And finally this week,

26:09.967 --> 26:11.967
a quick update
regarding zebras.

26:11.967 --> 26:14.266
Now, you may remember,
on our last show,

26:14.266 --> 26:16.333
we told you about
Bolivian traffic zebras,

26:16.333 --> 26:18.333
young people in costumes
who direct cars

26:18.333 --> 26:19.834
and promote road safety.

26:19.834 --> 26:21.133
And at the end of that piece,

26:21.133 --> 26:23.266
we made the case
that adding zebras to things

26:23.266 --> 26:24.967
is always an improvement.

26:24.967 --> 26:28.066
We even uploaded
23 minutes of zebra footage

26:28.066 --> 26:30.767
so you could add zebras
to whatever you wanted.

26:30.767 --> 26:32.233
And let me just say,

26:32.233 --> 26:35.533
you people
really came through for us.

26:35.533 --> 26:37.266
To give you just a flavor.

26:37.266 --> 26:40.066
You took Mariah Carey's
New Year's Eve disaster

26:40.066 --> 26:42.700
and vastly improved it
with zebras,

26:42.700 --> 26:46.400
you completely filled the White
House Press room with them,

26:46.400 --> 26:47.867
and you put zebras into movies,

26:47.867 --> 26:49.333
like "The Shining,"

26:49.333 --> 26:51.166
"Mad Max: Fury Road,"

26:51.166 --> 26:53.233
and naturally,
"Basic Instinct".

27:01.433 --> 27:02.900
- It's nice.

27:02.900 --> 27:05.200
- Thank you so much

27:05.200 --> 27:08.266
for wasting so much
of your time with us.

27:08.266 --> 27:09.667
The point of this

27:09.667 --> 27:11.500
was to make painful moments
easier to swallow.

27:11.500 --> 27:14.033
That's why we put a zebra
into Trump's inauguration.

27:14.033 --> 27:17.500
Well, someone took that to the
next logical step.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.867
'Cause remember Trump
riding the escalator

27:19.867 --> 27:21.233
to announce his candidacy?

27:21.233 --> 27:23.700
It's a pretty horrible memory,
right?

27:23.700 --> 27:26.667
Well, get ready
to have it slightly improved.

27:26.667 --> 27:30.200
- ♪ With your baby in hand ♪

27:30.200 --> 27:33.567
♪ And an old street light ♪

27:33.567 --> 27:35.133
- It's better now.

27:35.133 --> 27:37.133
That doesn't fundamentally
change anything,

27:37.133 --> 27:39.633
but it is just better now.

27:39.633 --> 27:41.734
Now interestingly,
adding zebras turns out

27:41.734 --> 27:44.033
to make great moments
even greater as well,

27:44.033 --> 27:46.800
like this one.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.500
- Good evening.

27:48.500 --> 27:53.066
Tonight I can report to the
American people and to the world

27:53.066 --> 27:55.433
that the United States
has conducted an operation

27:55.433 --> 27:59.266
that killed Osama bin Laden,
the leader of al-Qaeda.

27:59.266 --> 28:00.600
- Yeah.

28:00.600 --> 28:03.967
And that's what I
will always remember now.

28:03.967 --> 28:06.934
But perhaps the most exciting
thing was the response

28:06.934 --> 28:09.333
to our piece
in Bolivia itself.

28:09.333 --> 28:10.767
translator: I saw it live.

28:10.767 --> 28:12.734
I was watching it on Sunday,
"Last Week Tonight,"

28:12.734 --> 28:14.100
John Oliver's program.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.233
And suddenly he starts
talking about the zebras.

28:16.233 --> 28:17.734
I thought he was only
going to comment,

28:17.734 --> 28:19.567
and suddenly he keeps talking
and talking.

28:19.567 --> 28:22.567
He keeps talking.

28:22.567 --> 28:24.633
- "I thought he was only
going to comment,

28:24.633 --> 28:26.400
"and suddenly
he keeps talking and talking.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.700
He keeps talking."

28:27.700 --> 28:31.066
That is an entirely fair
description of this show.

28:31.066 --> 28:32.900
And it actually gets
one step better,

28:32.900 --> 28:36.633
because the cebritas themselves
issued a public message.

28:36.633 --> 28:38.533
- [speaking Spanish]

28:38.533 --> 28:40.400
translator: John Oliver,
we want to invite you

28:40.400 --> 28:43.500
to La Paz, Bolivia,
to be a zebra for one day.

28:43.500 --> 28:48.300
The mayor of our Wonder City,
Luis Revilla, agrees.

28:48.300 --> 28:51.834
The 265 zebras
are waiting in La Paz.

28:51.834 --> 28:54.834
- Now, I know it's
a friendly invitation,

28:54.834 --> 28:57.166
but honestly there is
no world in which the phrase

28:57.166 --> 29:00.233
"265 zebras are waiting
for you in La Paz"

29:00.233 --> 29:03.333
does not sound
like a genuine threat.

29:03.333 --> 29:05.900
But it's true, I have been
invited to be a zebra,

29:05.900 --> 29:08.500
and sadly, I'm not going to be
able to do that anytime soon,

29:08.500 --> 29:09.867
'cause I have to be here.

29:09.867 --> 29:12.200
So this is really
a very disappointing moment

29:12.200 --> 29:15.667
for both myself
and the nation of Bolivia.

29:15.667 --> 29:18.400
But as I think
we both now know,

29:18.400 --> 29:21.200
there is a real way
to improve moments like this.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.400
Hit!

29:22.400 --> 29:23.700
[upbeat music]

29:23.700 --> 29:24.767
It's better now!

29:24.767 --> 29:26.200
That's our show!

29:26.200 --> 29:28.433

29:28.433 --> 29:29.967
