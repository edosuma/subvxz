WEBVTT

00:05.048 --> 00:05.962
Yeah!

00:06.832 --> 00:08.312
Yes, my lord.

00:09.139 --> 00:11.359
Oh, yeah. Fuck me!

00:11.620 --> 00:13.926
I'm fucking you!

00:15.711 --> 00:17.060
Fuck me like King Arthur!

00:18.322 --> 00:19.497
Eh?

00:20.063 --> 00:22.022
Fuck me like King Arthur.

00:22.326 --> 00:25.329
- He was about 80, wasn't he?
- Was he? Then...

00:26.330 --> 00:28.550
Fuck me like Sir Lancelot.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.334
Oh, yeah!

00:30.378 --> 00:32.684
That's more like it!

00:34.077 --> 00:36.601
I am Sir Lancelot,

00:36.862 --> 00:39.778
knight of the fucking round
table!

00:40.910 --> 00:43.565
Come on, Lancelot!
You can do it!

00:43.608 --> 00:45.262
Come on!

00:47.743 --> 00:48.613
Who the hell are you?

00:50.224 --> 00:51.268
Are you Ben Lyk?

00:51.834 --> 00:53.792
- No...
- Jesus, Ben,

00:54.054 --> 00:56.491
don't lie to him, he's got a
gun!

00:57.753 --> 00:59.059
Did his wife send you?

01:05.152 --> 01:06.501
Oh, God!

01:07.763 --> 01:08.720
Wait!

01:09.199 --> 01:10.418
Please!

01:11.245 --> 01:13.073
You've made a mistake.

01:13.116 --> 01:15.858
My wife has been awayon business a lot, I was lonely.

01:16.119 --> 01:18.600
I've never been in trouble
before!

01:18.643 --> 01:20.080
I drive a Prius!

01:20.341 --> 01:21.516
You have me mistaken
with somebody...

01:37.662 --> 01:39.055
Fuck.

01:41.449 --> 01:43.929
- How do you spell your name?
- What?

01:43.973 --> 01:47.194
How do you spell your name?

01:47.237 --> 01:51.720
B-E-N L-Y-K

03:01.964 --> 03:04.184
Hi gang, Ben here...

03:07.404 --> 03:10.364
Hey peeps,
got some big news for you...

03:10.407 --> 03:12.975
I've got... No, it's...

03:14.759 --> 03:16.239
Yo!

03:16.283 --> 03:19.416
This is Benji, coming at you
with
some more news...

03:22.071 --> 03:23.072
Just be genuine.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.645
Hey "Lykers", it's me.

03:30.906 --> 03:34.910
Sorry if I'm not myself today
but something terrible has
happened.

03:34.953 --> 03:37.956
It's not everyday
that you check the news to
discover

03:38.000 --> 03:39.958
you have been murdered.

03:40.002 --> 03:44.136
Shot in the head.
Same name, same city, at home.

03:45.050 --> 03:47.575
For a split second
I actually thought I'd been
killed.

03:47.618 --> 03:48.837
And was married.

03:50.926 --> 03:52.144
Anyway...

03:53.320 --> 03:56.061
Really shacking me up, guys.
As it would.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.455
And I'm not sure how
I'm supposed to feel.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.589
How would you feel, "Lykers"?

04:01.632 --> 04:04.592
How would you feel
if your namesake had been
killed?

04:04.635 --> 04:08.073
So I want you to get in touch,
guys.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.554
I want to hear what you've got
to say about all this.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.863
I want you to get in touch,
guys.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.126
I want to hear what you've got
to say about all this.

04:17.169 --> 04:19.563
I don't know
what you're worried about.

04:19.607 --> 04:20.956
I'll play it again, shall I?

04:20.999 --> 04:23.263
You look fine!
A bit tired.

04:23.306 --> 04:24.786
I'm not worried about that.

04:24.829 --> 04:28.093
Hey, "Lykers", it's me. Sorry if I'm not myself today...

04:28.137 --> 04:31.662
- No, not tired...
- Not tired?

04:32.315 --> 04:33.577
Sexy?

04:34.448 --> 04:35.927
- Tired and sexy?
- Yeah!

04:35.971 --> 04:38.278
Like an exhausted Ryan Gosling
kind of thing?

04:38.321 --> 04:40.802
- No, not exactly...
- I can live with that.

04:40.845 --> 04:43.457
Roberto,
what if the killer made a
mistake?

04:44.675 --> 04:48.723
Like he was aiming for the kneesand got him in the face?

04:48.766 --> 04:52.030
No... As in he got the wrong
man.

04:53.554 --> 04:56.296
Let me paint a scenario for you,okay?

04:58.036 --> 04:59.908
I'm a hitman and I get an email

05:00.169 --> 05:03.085
saying "kill Ben Lyk in London".Or something to that effect.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.914
I have no idea,I've never ordered someone dead.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.916
I'm not that smart.

05:07.959 --> 05:11.528
I google "Ben Lyk London".I pick the first Ben Lyk on thelist.

05:11.572 --> 05:12.834
And bang!

05:13.661 --> 05:15.619
I've waisted the wrong man.

05:19.710 --> 05:22.757
I'm not sure they'd be
emailing each other about all
this.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.236
No!

05:24.498 --> 05:27.370
What if the bullet was meant forme?

05:27.414 --> 05:30.286
You know: "somewhere there's a
bullet
with your name on it".

05:32.201 --> 05:33.681
Right...

05:34.595 --> 05:37.859
Alright,
if I'm being totally honest...

05:37.902 --> 05:40.340
- Yeah, please.
- with you...

05:41.341 --> 05:44.126
Sometimes,
your videos aren't always...

05:45.910 --> 05:47.869
that amazing. But...

05:48.609 --> 05:50.350
Do you deserve to die?

05:52.874 --> 05:54.266
Maybe.

05:56.094 --> 05:58.619
Work on your manners.A little sympathy would be nice.

05:58.662 --> 06:00.447
My namesake's just been killed.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.362
Honestly, Robbie!

06:02.623 --> 06:04.320
Sorry for your loss?

06:07.932 --> 06:09.369
That's better.

06:09.630 --> 06:12.023
- Was it Confucius or was it
Tao...
- Hey, Ben !

06:12.067 --> 06:13.416
Hi!

06:13.460 --> 06:14.591
Hi, there!

06:15.723 --> 06:19.248
You see that?People are starting to know whoI am.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.685
No, that was Anna.

06:22.294 --> 06:23.252
So?

06:23.818 --> 06:25.167
She's your neighbour.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.256
I knowbut there's something different

06:27.299 --> 06:29.389
about the way she's saying
hello.

06:29.432 --> 06:31.695
- There's a glint in the eye.
- No.

06:31.739 --> 06:34.219
I reckon she's seen my videos.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.570
- She's a neighbour!
- She's a "Lyker".

06:36.613 --> 06:38.310
Do you know
how many hits I've got, now?

06:38.963 --> 06:39.834
Thousands!

06:40.965 --> 06:44.491
Come on, lads! It's only four
nil.
You can still make it!

06:46.188 --> 06:47.668
Or not!

06:47.711 --> 06:50.975
What to do
when West Ham loses against
Chelsea?

06:51.236 --> 06:53.456
What to do
when you're stuck in Paris...

06:53.500 --> 06:55.632
Anyway, let's say hello
to my new companion, here.

06:55.676 --> 06:59.157
Hi there! How long have you been waiting?

07:00.332 --> 07:02.334
Dave, this bloke's trying it on.

07:02.378 --> 07:03.858
- Oh, no !
- That's my wife.

07:03.901 --> 07:06.077
It's perfectly alright.
I'm a vlogger, don't worry.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.079
I've noticed an accent,
where are you from?

07:09.603 --> 07:10.604
That's my wife!

07:10.865 --> 07:13.171
But people keep hurting you, no?

07:13.781 --> 07:15.957
Yeah, well... It's a niche.

07:17.306 --> 07:20.483
It might hurt a bit,
but you've got to admit it's
working.

07:20.527 --> 07:21.658
Is it?

07:22.180 --> 07:24.182
People are watching, Robbie!

07:24.226 --> 07:27.403
I'm telling you. Soon,
everyone's
gonna want a piece of Ben Lyk.

08:07.748 --> 08:09.401
Fuck.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.235
Fuck!

08:18.019 --> 08:20.325
Two in two days!

08:20.369 --> 08:22.414
Both in London.
This is not a coincidence.

08:22.458 --> 08:23.938
No, no, no.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.331
This could be a miracle.

08:26.375 --> 08:29.552
A miracle?A miracle is turning water intowine!

08:29.596 --> 08:32.555
Show me where in the Bible it
says:
"And lo, Jesus did pull

08:32.816 --> 08:35.863
"a semi-automatic from his
loincloth
and blow a man's face off."

08:37.604 --> 08:38.735
New Testament?

08:40.041 --> 08:40.911
You're high.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.566
Yeah...

08:43.827 --> 08:47.004
Let's just try to focus, okay?
Please, I need you right now.

08:50.442 --> 08:53.881
I'm sure there's
a simple explanation for all
this.

08:54.490 --> 08:55.491
Like what?

08:55.752 --> 08:58.886
Someone probably texted the
killer...

08:59.974 --> 09:03.499
- The same instructions twice.
- Can you not yawn?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.762
- At a time like this!
- It happens all the time!

09:05.806 --> 09:07.242
My mum once texted me:

09:07.285 --> 09:10.332
"Don't forget you dad's heart
pills"
seven times!

09:11.202 --> 09:14.641
- How is your dad?- After the heart attack? God...

09:14.684 --> 09:16.556
Still hasn't forgiven me.

09:16.817 --> 09:19.384
These are professionals, not
idiots.

09:20.211 --> 09:24.259
Even if
someone is killing all the Ben
Lyks,

09:25.390 --> 09:27.610
what makes you thinkthey're gonna come for you next?

09:27.654 --> 09:30.961
The name of my YouTube account
is "IAmBenLyk".

09:31.005 --> 09:34.008
There's videos of everything.
My street, my flat. Me doing

09:34.269 --> 09:35.705
press ups on the toilet.
Pushing...

09:35.749 --> 09:38.273
- What?- People don't like a show off.

09:38.316 --> 09:41.755
"How to exercise in a small
flat"
got over 200 000 views!

09:43.495 --> 09:45.019
Delete the account.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.238
No, I'm not deleting the
account!

09:47.282 --> 09:49.589
I've got over 5 million hits!
No way!

09:49.850 --> 09:52.722
I can't.
My fans would think I'm a
coward!

09:52.766 --> 09:55.638
And if there's one thing I'm
not,
it's a coward.

09:55.899 --> 09:58.206
Please, don't kill me!

09:58.249 --> 10:00.774
My name is Ben Lyk,
but I didn't choose it!

10:00.817 --> 10:04.734
My parents did!
If it's anyone fault, it's
theirs!

10:04.778 --> 10:08.346
Don't kill them either.
Not my mum, anyway. My dad...

10:08.390 --> 10:11.611
He can be annoying
but he doesn't deserve to die!

10:11.872 --> 10:15.179
Please, go easy on my.
Actually, you know what?

10:15.223 --> 10:17.442
If you're a female,

10:17.486 --> 10:20.489
I can tell you now I am more
than willing to pay with my
body.

10:20.532 --> 10:23.710
I will do literally anything.
Anything except...

10:23.753 --> 10:25.755
Put it this way...
I'm not good with pain.

10:25.799 --> 10:28.105
But otherwise, I'm good to go.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.673
Please, just...
Please, please!

10:30.717 --> 10:33.676
I don't know what else to say.
Just don't kill me.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.378
I need your help.

10:40.422 --> 10:43.294
Two Ben Lyks have been killed
in the last two days.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.253
And I might be next.

10:45.296 --> 10:48.560
I went to the police
but they just turned me away.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.650
Coincidence, they said.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.740
Now, I don't know what to do.

10:53.783 --> 10:56.046
I need protection.

10:56.090 --> 10:58.266
I can't go outside,
I'm too scared!

10:58.527 --> 11:01.356
Please, if anybody thinks they can help,

11:01.399 --> 11:04.751
private message me.
My life depends on it.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.535
A bit dramatic!

11:06.578 --> 11:09.451
- What do you think?- I'll tell you what I think...

11:09.494 --> 11:13.498
My video's had over a million
views,
this only had 2 000.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.805
That's not competition.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.807
I know! What I'm saying is...

11:18.068 --> 11:21.115
He obviously needs help
and I reckon I'm the man.

11:21.724 --> 11:22.986
How?

11:24.509 --> 11:26.033
We can join forces.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.339
Make a mega video.

11:29.036 --> 11:31.734
- That'll draw more attention toyou.
- Exactly the point!

11:31.778 --> 11:36.304
Think of it! It'll be like BandAid
but for people called Ben Lyk.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.741
Police are bound to respond
if it goes viral.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.614
You're gonna make a music video?

11:45.313 --> 11:46.749
Yes, please!

11:52.059 --> 11:52.973
Hi, Ben!

11:53.321 --> 11:56.106
- Thanks for responding.
- Hi! I'm Roberto.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.542
You're all right then, aren't
you?

11:58.065 --> 12:01.503
-Yeah, good, thanks!
- Don't worry about him, he's
stone.

12:01.764 --> 12:05.289
Look, Ben. I saw your video
and I just want you to know

12:05.333 --> 12:08.249
I'm right behind you, mate.
Not in the cowardly way,

12:08.510 --> 12:10.468
like I'd use you as body armour.

12:11.382 --> 12:13.863
- In "I'm on your side, body"
way.
- Right.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.083
I saw a couple of your videos,
too.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.780
Oh, great. Cool!

12:17.824 --> 12:20.391
Always happy to welcome a new
fan!
What did you think?

12:21.741 --> 12:25.832
Let's just say same name,
different sense of humour.

12:27.355 --> 12:28.182
Okay.

12:29.487 --> 12:30.445
So you liked them?

12:30.706 --> 12:32.534
No! I thought it was shit.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.579
I get it.

12:34.623 --> 12:36.625
You're under a lot of pressure.

12:36.886 --> 12:40.455
So am I. I'm in the same
position.
Go back after all this is blow
over

12:40.498 --> 12:42.022
and look at them again.

12:42.065 --> 12:46.243
They're not as shit as you
think.
They're really not.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.550
Has anyone ever pointed out
what an ego you have?

12:49.899 --> 12:50.770
Oh my fuck!

12:51.074 --> 12:52.293
Jesus!

12:52.336 --> 12:53.207
Oh, my God!

12:53.642 --> 12:55.035
- He killed him!
- He killed him in the face.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.560
I mean, he was a bit of an
arsehole,
but there's no need for that.
Fuck!

12:58.603 --> 13:01.041
- Fuck. Unnecessary.
- What shall I do?

13:02.607 --> 13:03.521
Have a smoke?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.306
No! You know how paranoid I get!

13:05.567 --> 13:08.396
- You mind if I...- This isn't about you, Robbie!

13:08.439 --> 13:10.659
- My life's in danger!
- Alright, alright.

13:12.617 --> 13:13.923
Go to the police.

13:14.663 --> 13:15.533
You coming?

13:16.883 --> 13:18.885
No, I'll stay here,

13:19.146 --> 13:20.712
chill out...

13:20.756 --> 13:23.324
You can't stay here, Robbie.The killer will think you're me!

13:23.585 --> 13:26.109
- Right!
- I need your help!

13:26.153 --> 13:27.763
Please, just do something!

13:28.633 --> 13:30.679
Stay away from the window.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.899
I'll make sure the coast is
clear.
That's something people do,
isn't it?

13:32.942 --> 13:35.597
Stop yelling, for once in your
life.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.294
Fuck, Ben!

13:41.777 --> 13:43.735
- Hurry up!
- Alright...

13:44.911 --> 13:46.608
Well, I won't be long...

13:47.391 --> 13:50.177
I'm not gonna die,
I'm not gonna die...

13:53.136 --> 13:54.790
I'm gonna be fine.

13:55.530 --> 13:58.185
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die!

13:59.926 --> 14:03.059
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!
Shit!

14:04.495 --> 14:05.801
Is it clear?

14:07.629 --> 14:08.891
Robbie?

14:12.025 --> 14:13.026
Roberto?

14:18.553 --> 14:19.684
You want to fuck with...

14:25.952 --> 14:29.651
No, get off me!
I'm not a Ben Lyk.

14:29.694 --> 14:30.957
Help!

14:43.360 --> 14:44.405
Anyone?

14:47.974 --> 14:49.105
Shit!

14:49.932 --> 14:53.370
-Coming!
- Please, let me in.

14:54.763 --> 14:58.158
Hi. I'm your neighbour.
I live right above you.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.029
Great. We're a bit busy right
now.

15:00.073 --> 15:02.423
Okay.
Can I come in for a minute?

15:02.466 --> 15:04.077
Were we being too loud?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.034
We're being too loud?

15:05.817 --> 15:09.082
Oh, that? No, I've only heard
you
like 3 or 4 dozen times.

15:09.343 --> 15:10.997
I'm glad you're having fun.
Listen.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.781
I just need to come in for a
minute.

15:12.824 --> 15:16.089
- Who's this?
- He says he lives upstairs.

15:16.132 --> 15:19.135
- I think it's about the
screaming.
- Does he wanna join in?

15:19.179 --> 15:22.051
I don't know. You wanna join in?

15:22.095 --> 15:24.445
I'd love to. I'd be delighted,
yes.
Thank you!

15:24.488 --> 15:26.534
- Wait a minute, you're not BenLyk?
- What?

15:26.795 --> 15:29.015
We keep getting your post.

15:29.058 --> 15:32.235
- Sorry.
- Get away, you're dangerous!

15:32.279 --> 15:33.454
Don't you watch the news?

16:03.397 --> 16:05.094
- Please!
- Pack some clothes.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.488
- You're not safe here.
- You're the police?

16:07.531 --> 16:10.534
Oh, God!
Thank you, officer! Thank you!

16:10.795 --> 16:14.495
You took your time! Hi, guys!You brought your friends, thankyou!

16:14.756 --> 16:16.279
Less chatting, more packing.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.499
I've already packed,
but can I just do a video?

16:18.760 --> 16:19.804
No!

16:20.805 --> 16:23.112
- Let's go.
- God, you are crabby !

16:23.156 --> 16:26.072
Really crabby.And I don't use that word often!

16:31.077 --> 16:34.950
What to do when you're in a
police
van on your way to God knows
where?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.386
What did you say?

16:36.430 --> 16:39.302
I just said for a policeman,
you've got lovely hair.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.002
Right.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.006
Thanks.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.489
It's quite oily.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.709
It gives it shine.

16:56.972 --> 17:01.281
I'm gonna be away for a little
while,
so I may not be able to
communicate.

17:01.585 --> 17:03.065
What are you saying?

17:03.326 --> 17:05.328
I just talk to myself
when I'm nervous, okay?

17:05.372 --> 17:06.938
Well, don't.

17:06.982 --> 17:09.506
- I just paid you a compliment.- And I said thank you.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.465
- Now, shut up!
- Cool.

17:16.644 --> 17:18.863
It does have a nice shine,
governor.

17:18.907 --> 17:22.432
Alright! Thank you!
Conversation over!

17:31.137 --> 17:34.314
This is police brutality. I onlyasked where you kept your
truncheon.

17:34.357 --> 17:36.011
It was a genuine question.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.931
Still, you didn't use you taser,so I should be thanking you forthat.

17:42.974 --> 17:46.021
Okay, let's get you inside.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.851
Thank you.

17:49.894 --> 17:52.375
This is Chiswick, isn't it?
You taking me all the way to
the...

17:54.508 --> 17:56.771
Come on, then. Don't hang about!

17:56.814 --> 17:59.295
This is gonna be home for a
while.
I wanna take it all in.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.645
Shut up!

18:06.433 --> 18:08.261
This is nice, isn't it?

18:08.304 --> 18:10.741
You must be chuffed to bits
to be working here!

18:10.785 --> 18:12.613
Does it belong to the police
or do you rent it?

18:12.656 --> 18:15.746
It's a safe house.
Your room's up here.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.357
Second on the left.

18:18.662 --> 18:22.318
It's my parents' anniversary
soon,
that can be a perfect spot for
them.

18:31.371 --> 18:32.633
Home sweet home.

18:34.896 --> 18:37.377
Yeah, this is great!

18:38.029 --> 18:39.205
I'll take it.

18:40.423 --> 18:41.903
How old are you?

18:42.556 --> 18:43.905
How old do I look?

18:46.299 --> 18:49.258
Come on...
Everybody's waiting.

18:51.434 --> 18:52.740
Everybody?

18:53.871 --> 18:54.916
Now!

18:59.921 --> 19:03.403
Inspector Talisker.
Welcome, Mr Lyk.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.274
You can join the others, now.

19:06.493 --> 19:07.581
Just this way.

19:24.467 --> 19:25.903
Alright.

19:25.947 --> 19:28.254
First of all, I would like to
say

19:28.515 --> 19:29.777
welcome!

19:29.820 --> 19:32.083
It's great to have you all here!

19:32.649 --> 19:35.739
I only wish it was
under nicer circumstances.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.916
A music recital, something likethat.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.745
This is Scott, my...

19:42.006 --> 19:43.530
I want to say "assistant".

19:44.835 --> 19:46.794
- Second in command.
- Exactly.

19:46.837 --> 19:49.144
So if you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.363
If it's urgent.

19:50.711 --> 19:53.975
Yes. If you have an urgent needfor some tea. Coffee.

19:54.236 --> 19:57.065
- If you're in trouble or any
danger.
- Precisely.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.415
You may run out of toilet
roll...

19:59.459 --> 20:02.853
Or have a headache. I know thishas been very stressful for you.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.246
Yeah.

20:05.116 --> 20:08.381
Now, I'd like to apologize
on behalf of the Metropolitan
Police

20:08.424 --> 20:11.427
for taking so long to get to
you.
Although it really is

20:11.688 --> 20:16.258
the first Ben Lyk, who made thevideo
who we ought to apologize to.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.042
I'm happy to accept the apology.

20:18.086 --> 20:20.175
Given that he was
so brutally murdered.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.790
After watching his video,
we began our investigation in
earnest

20:27.269 --> 20:30.794
and we've come to the conclusionthat the three murders are
indeed...

20:31.099 --> 20:32.970
linked.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.363
How many hours did that take?

20:35.103 --> 20:38.237
All we know at the moment is
that
three people have murdered in
London.

20:38.889 --> 20:41.414
All by the name of Ben Lyk.

20:41.457 --> 20:44.112
We're not sure there'll be
another,
but as a matter of precaution,

20:44.155 --> 20:48.203
Scotland Yard decided to gatherall Ben Lyks to protect them.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.641
You're the eight
we were able to locate.

20:51.685 --> 20:54.601
Okay.Call me sexist, a lot of peopledo

20:54.644 --> 20:56.342
but I've got to ask.
Who's the girl?

20:56.603 --> 20:57.560
Ben Lyk...

20:57.821 --> 20:58.779
Bollocks!

20:59.040 --> 21:00.476
Language, if you don't mind.

21:00.737 --> 21:03.174
Why would I lie? That would meanI want to be in here with you.

21:06.656 --> 21:08.397
What?

21:08.441 --> 21:10.704
My dad was drunk at the
Christening.
He said Ben instead of Bee.

21:11.444 --> 21:13.272
- What a wally!
- He's an alcoholic.

21:14.751 --> 21:15.796
A very tragic wally.

21:16.623 --> 21:21.018
The killer is looking for a guy,is it necessary for me to be
here?

21:21.062 --> 21:24.674
- We're not taking any chances.- Thank you Scott, I've got
this.

21:24.718 --> 21:26.067
We're not taking any chances.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.721
- Sorry.
- Fuck off.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.465
- I have to get this, it's
urgent.
- Urgent?

21:32.726 --> 21:34.075
What's going on, here?

21:34.118 --> 21:36.686
Call me paranoid,
but it could be anyone of us.

21:38.427 --> 21:41.038
Yeah. He's right.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.997
We might be better off apart.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.521
I wouldn't mind getting out of
here.
I've got a date tonight.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.654
- Guys...
- I was...

21:47.915 --> 21:51.484
halfway through baking a loaf
when your dudes burst in.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.094
Soda bread is no easy, you know.

21:53.399 --> 21:54.400
Guys.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.315
There's something I need to say.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.273
- You're the murderer.
- Actually...

21:58.534 --> 22:01.015
I was going to suggest that we
pray.

22:02.408 --> 22:04.801
I'm Father Lyk and...

22:04.845 --> 22:10.329
it would mean a lot to me if wecould
say a prayer at this time of
need.

22:10.590 --> 22:13.244
- Our father...
- Alright, put her on.

22:13.288 --> 22:14.855
Hallowed be thy name.

22:15.116 --> 22:17.205
Hello sweetie pie!

22:17.248 --> 22:20.382
What would you like? The Three
Bears
or Billy Goat's Gruff?

22:20.426 --> 22:22.036
Amen.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.908
Right.
"Once upon a time..."

22:25.996 --> 22:27.868
This is ridiculous!

22:27.911 --> 22:29.217
God is not gonna help us.

22:29.478 --> 22:32.481
If you open yourself up,
He will listen.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.223
- I have a therapist for that.
- Dude...

22:35.528 --> 22:39.096
No disrespect but you look
more like a scrum-halk than a
vicar.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.360
- Fly-half, actually.
- Okay.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.492
The Bishop's got a team.

22:43.797 --> 22:48.497
What if we're being targeted
becausewe've all done something wrong?

22:49.237 --> 22:50.630
Skeletons in the closet?

22:50.891 --> 22:51.805
Not me.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.589
I stick to the rules.

22:53.850 --> 22:56.636
Yeah?
Never stolen a towel from a
hotel?

22:56.679 --> 22:57.680
No.

22:58.246 --> 22:59.595
Boring.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.423
Why does it have
to be something we did?

23:01.467 --> 23:04.818
Maybe it's justa psychopath getting his kicks.

23:04.861 --> 23:07.037
I'm a banker,
I work with loads of guys like
this.

23:07.298 --> 23:08.299
So it's someone you know?

23:08.561 --> 23:11.041
No. They don't kill people.

23:12.956 --> 23:14.218
Probably.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.612
I understand how worried you are

23:16.656 --> 23:19.746
but I want you to rest assured
that
whilst you're under our
protection...

23:19.789 --> 23:21.574
You'll be safe. He's right.

23:22.183 --> 23:23.924
How long will this take?

23:24.403 --> 23:27.144
Because I've got a date
tomorrow night as well.

23:27.797 --> 23:30.452
And Thursday. And Friday.

23:30.713 --> 23:31.758
I mean...

23:31.801 --> 23:32.672
Saturday's free.

23:32.933 --> 23:35.631
Yeah, alright Casanova. We get
it.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.417
Still waiting about Sunday,
though.

23:40.593 --> 23:43.900
I'm losing money every time I
breath,
and the more anxious I get,

23:43.944 --> 23:46.729
the faster I breath so can youat least let me get my computerback?

23:46.773 --> 23:47.687
No.

23:48.557 --> 23:50.603
No computers, no phones, no
Internet.
You must have no access

23:50.864 --> 23:53.170
- to the outside world.
- No, you must be joking!

23:53.214 --> 23:55.477
I can't survive without it.
I need it for a medical
condition.

23:57.218 --> 23:59.002
Just need to get this.

23:59.046 --> 24:02.005
Do you chaps
have any bulletproof vests?

24:02.702 --> 24:04.443
Green if possible.

24:04.704 --> 24:06.140
Green is the new black.

24:06.401 --> 24:07.576
I mean, don't...

24:27.204 --> 24:30.164
It's cold! Can you getsomeone to warm this up, please?

24:31.731 --> 24:36.213
For what we are about to
receive,
may we be truly thankful.

24:36.257 --> 24:39.782
It's deep crust pastry.
It's not the body of Christ.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.707
I could be on a date right now.

24:51.751 --> 24:53.535
Where were you taking the date?

24:54.318 --> 24:55.537
Pizza Hut.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.197
Hi. Are you okay?

25:03.240 --> 25:05.373
Yeah. I just don't like
anchovies.

25:05.416 --> 25:07.549
Me neither.
I hate them, it's disgusting!

25:07.593 --> 25:09.377
It reminds me
of a video I did, actually.

25:09.420 --> 25:12.728
"What to do
when your house smells like
fish?"

25:12.989 --> 25:15.644
- Maybe you've seen it?
- No. I've seen another video.

25:15.688 --> 25:17.472
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.519
Was it "How to pretend you don'trecognise an Internet
sensation"?

25:20.562 --> 25:23.086
No. You were actually crying.

25:23.130 --> 25:24.087
And begging.

25:24.348 --> 25:26.176
Something like:
"Please don't kill me".

25:26.437 --> 25:29.179
Right, sure. That was...

25:29.223 --> 25:32.748
That was for the audience,
though.
Because they like drama.
Intrigue.

25:32.792 --> 25:35.098
I can't tell you how many videosthere are of me laughing...

25:35.142 --> 25:36.360
You know...

25:37.057 --> 25:40.626
In one of your videos,
you were offering your body.

25:43.106 --> 25:44.673
Is that right?

25:47.371 --> 25:49.548
Why? Are you interested?

25:50.461 --> 25:52.028
- Yeah.
- Really?

25:52.289 --> 25:53.247
Yeah.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.510
Let's go up to my room.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.730
You can do whatever you want tome.

26:02.125 --> 26:02.996
Okay!

26:03.300 --> 26:05.607
Just don't tell the vicar.
Come on.

26:05.651 --> 26:06.477
Okay.

26:07.566 --> 26:10.003
Great, I can do that!
God, you move quickly!

26:11.439 --> 26:14.790
- I go before you and you followme?
- Yeah, even better.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.619
Oh, thank God.

26:17.663 --> 26:21.144
Oh, God, there is a goodness
to this thing, isn't there?

26:21.188 --> 26:24.060
Come off it.
I like men, not cry babies.

26:27.803 --> 26:30.676
- Mate she cannot get enough ofyou.
- Yeah, well...

26:30.937 --> 26:33.461
Joke's on her actually.
I was teasing.

26:42.165 --> 26:43.863
Oh, my God!

26:46.256 --> 26:47.997
What's wrong with you?

26:48.258 --> 26:50.739
The pizzas are fucking poison!
They're trying to kill us!

26:51.000 --> 26:52.741
We have a problem.

26:52.785 --> 26:54.482
- Are you okay?
- No.

26:55.222 --> 26:56.615
I'm fucking not okay.

26:57.877 --> 27:00.053
- Feeling better?
- Yes, thanks.

27:00.096 --> 27:02.795
- Drink this.
- Thank you. Cheers.

27:02.838 --> 27:05.798
It's a good thing
I didn't eat any of my pizza.

27:05.841 --> 27:08.888
I don't know what it is,
I have this innate survival
instinct

27:08.931 --> 27:11.542
that just comes out
every time I sense danger.

27:11.586 --> 27:14.371
- I share that with the Baboon.- Shut up.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.418
- They have these cheeks and...- Shut up!

27:19.115 --> 27:20.203
Yes, sir.

27:21.117 --> 27:24.730
No, it's okay.
It's a false alarm, sir.

27:24.773 --> 27:27.515
Yes,
I think it was just food
poisoning.

27:28.342 --> 27:30.692
No, we're all good here, sir.

27:30.736 --> 27:34.087
It's nothing we can't handle.
Everything's under control.

27:36.437 --> 27:37.743
Thank you, sir.

28:04.595 --> 28:06.554
The dose of cyanide.

28:07.337 --> 28:11.385
- It was not enough.
- We were just testing the
waters.

28:11.428 --> 28:14.214
Police have done us a favour.
It's gonna be much easier,

28:14.475 --> 28:16.172
now they're all together.

28:16.216 --> 28:17.696
No more mistakes.

28:30.883 --> 28:32.058
Not bad.

28:32.972 --> 28:34.408
Pretty good, actually.

28:36.018 --> 28:39.282
The pizzas were poisoned.Which means they know we're allhere.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.241
I think we should be armed.

28:41.807 --> 28:46.028
For the food to be poisoned,there'd have to be an intruder.

28:46.289 --> 28:48.727
Which is impossible
since we have cameras
everywhere.

28:49.205 --> 28:52.121
How can you be sure
it's not one of your guys?

28:53.427 --> 28:55.385
I chose this team myself.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.779
And I don't make mistakes.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.738
Scott has been with me
for five years.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.696
What if it's one of you guys?

29:01.957 --> 29:04.264
Fuck off! You said it yourself.

29:04.525 --> 29:06.614
- Bankers are all psychopaths.
- Yeah...

29:06.657 --> 29:08.529
I don't really care what you
think.

29:08.572 --> 29:12.359
See? Classic psychopath!
No fucking empathy!

29:12.620 --> 29:14.665
- Nobody's accusing anybody
here.
- I am!

29:14.709 --> 29:16.580
Just relax, okay?

29:16.842 --> 29:19.758
Everything's under control.
We'redoing all we can to protect you.

29:20.019 --> 29:21.760
I can look after myself.

29:26.895 --> 29:29.071
- Can you get him some water?
- Wait!

29:29.332 --> 29:31.813
- What did you eat?- Our Father, who art in heaven,

29:31.857 --> 29:34.642
Hallowed be thy name,
Thy kingdom come,

29:34.685 --> 29:35.556
Thy will be done on earth

29:35.817 --> 29:36.905
as it is in heaven,

29:36.949 --> 29:39.386
Give us this day our daily
bread...

29:41.214 --> 29:43.172
You fucking Pinocchio, you
prick!

29:43.216 --> 29:45.479
I'm so sorry!

29:45.522 --> 29:46.393
Your face!

29:53.574 --> 29:55.837
Oh God, that was funny!

29:56.882 --> 29:58.187
Fucking moron.

29:58.448 --> 29:59.972
I want them dead.

30:02.278 --> 30:03.932
You understand that?

30:05.542 --> 30:06.935
All of them.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.548
What are you wearing?

30:13.550 --> 30:14.725
Workout clothes.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.166
Are you working out?

30:20.688 --> 30:21.776
No.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.910
No? Then take them off.

30:26.172 --> 30:27.390
Take them off!

30:31.786 --> 30:33.005
Yes!

30:34.876 --> 30:37.270
Everything. Don't be shy.

30:41.535 --> 30:42.492
Here we go.

30:43.015 --> 30:44.320
That's good.

30:44.364 --> 30:45.800
What a beast!

30:52.241 --> 30:53.982
I'm gonna try and get some
sleep.

30:54.026 --> 30:56.855
Yeah. If you need anything,
just knock on my door.

30:56.898 --> 30:59.335
Oh, and if you need anything,

30:59.379 --> 31:02.512
- then just knock on the door.
- Oh, yeah...

31:02.556 --> 31:05.211
Should I come fully naked
or in my underwear?

31:07.343 --> 31:08.649
As you wish...

31:09.302 --> 31:10.738
I'm not bothered.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.001
Good night.

31:15.743 --> 31:17.440
I know a man when I see one.

31:18.050 --> 31:20.922
Oh, thanks.
I'm trying my best.

31:20.966 --> 31:22.968
- She's a tough nut to crack.
- No, no.

31:23.011 --> 31:24.665
I mean her.

31:24.708 --> 31:27.450
Pretty sure she's got a cock!

31:28.016 --> 31:28.930
What?

31:29.278 --> 31:32.238
I would know.
Thailand's my second home!

31:33.239 --> 31:35.284
Okay. And this is based on...

31:35.328 --> 31:37.025
A holiday, presumably. Or...

31:37.330 --> 31:38.766
Trust me.

31:38.809 --> 31:40.550
Take a look at the Adam's apple.

31:41.247 --> 31:43.075
Right there. It's big

31:43.336 --> 31:45.294
like a fucking foot ball.
Do you know what I mean?

31:46.556 --> 31:48.776
It's only gonna be weird
the first time, eh?

31:53.172 --> 31:54.695
It'll be like that.

31:55.261 --> 31:56.740
Just getting into your fucking
eye.

31:58.829 --> 31:59.743
She's a woman.

32:00.701 --> 32:04.270
- Keep your voice down. She's
there.
- Less of a... More of a...

32:04.313 --> 32:07.055
- Do you know what I mean?
- I get it, she has a penis!

32:07.099 --> 32:10.972
I get it, she has a penis.Please, can you just go to bed?

32:11.016 --> 32:13.192
- Please.
- Alright. Good night.

32:14.584 --> 32:15.585
Nice one!

32:19.024 --> 32:21.200
This is ridiculous!

32:21.243 --> 32:23.376
How am I meant
to run a business without a
phone?

32:23.419 --> 32:25.465
I'm supposedto be getting married next week.

32:25.900 --> 32:26.988
You?

32:27.771 --> 32:29.208
What's so odd about that?

32:29.251 --> 32:30.687
I don't know...

32:30.731 --> 32:32.428
- You're old.
- Fuck off!

32:35.692 --> 32:37.607
I'm not too old
to get us out of here.

32:38.695 --> 32:39.740
Eh?

32:40.219 --> 32:42.873
We might as well
be targets on a firing range,
boy.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.485
When I was in the Falklands,

32:45.876 --> 32:49.184
I was in charge of a company.
We got trapped in a disused
factory.

32:49.228 --> 32:52.709
The enemy was advancing on all
sides.
There was nowhere to turn.

32:52.753 --> 32:54.407
We were sitting ducks.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.104
Gripper.

32:57.410 --> 32:58.541
McDonald.

33:01.631 --> 33:02.632
Archer.

33:05.635 --> 33:08.682
First thing you do in a
situation
like this, is you split up.

33:09.335 --> 33:11.598
Alright. That makes sense.

33:11.641 --> 33:14.383
And what happened?
In the factory.

33:15.123 --> 33:16.516
The whole company was killed.

33:16.777 --> 33:19.998
- Shit!
- I was the only one who got
away.

33:23.827 --> 33:25.525
But... Weren't you in charge?

33:25.786 --> 33:27.005
Exactly.

33:27.657 --> 33:30.921
So if I can survive that,
I'm sure as hell gonna survive
this!

33:32.836 --> 33:34.577
I've seen where the fuse box is.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.799
We disable the security cameras.

33:39.060 --> 33:42.585
Giving us time to clear off.
Then we head to the nearest
village.

33:43.717 --> 33:45.240
You on my team, boy?

33:48.069 --> 33:50.028
You mean, like in the Falklands?

33:50.289 --> 33:52.247
If that's what you want... Yeah!

33:53.988 --> 33:55.163
Right...

33:56.295 --> 33:57.644
It's just...

33:58.340 --> 34:00.299
I don't want to end up
like the rest of your company.

34:01.561 --> 34:02.910
Heroes?

34:08.698 --> 34:11.223
Yes! Of course I'm fucking in!

34:14.878 --> 34:16.271
Have you got any coke?

34:21.755 --> 34:25.106
What to do when you're locked upwith 7 people who have the samename

34:25.150 --> 34:27.239
and one of them is beautiful?

34:27.282 --> 34:28.762
But possibly a man.

34:29.023 --> 34:31.286
What to do when you're stuck
in the attic of horror with...

34:31.547 --> 34:33.375
It's not actually a joke, is it?

34:33.419 --> 34:36.639
"My, what big teeth you've got,Grandma!"

34:37.075 --> 34:37.988
Not you.

34:38.772 --> 34:41.601
... when no one gives a shit where you are or who you are...

34:41.862 --> 34:43.168
What's going on?

34:43.429 --> 34:44.865
Hang on, sweetie.

34:45.561 --> 34:46.867
Go and check the power.

34:49.565 --> 34:51.306
Check the power. Over.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.047
Copy that. Over.

34:56.529 --> 34:58.313
Someone's already cut them!

34:58.966 --> 35:00.315
That's not good, is it?

35:01.099 --> 35:03.405
It's the Falklands all over
again.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.407
Oh, God.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.062
Oh, God!

35:21.075 --> 35:22.120
Are you okay?

35:22.685 --> 35:24.252
I'm ex commando.

35:24.296 --> 35:27.995
I've outrun a leopard before
now.
You just stick with me!

35:33.305 --> 35:34.828
Bloody hell!

35:35.568 --> 35:37.265
Stop! Who are you?

35:41.617 --> 35:42.836
Fuck!

36:12.082 --> 36:14.346
Shit, it's you!
I'm so sorry!

36:14.607 --> 36:16.086
Why were you running into the
woods?

36:16.348 --> 36:17.740
You just shot me!

36:18.611 --> 36:19.481
It bloody hurts!

36:20.265 --> 36:23.268
And this is a very nice jacket!

36:23.529 --> 36:24.573
Fuck!

36:37.760 --> 36:41.068
What the fuck!
What the hell are you doing?

36:41.111 --> 36:42.330
Sorry, you should have knocked!

36:42.591 --> 36:43.853
You've made that clear!

36:44.114 --> 36:45.812
You just bulled me in the face!

36:46.813 --> 36:48.380
Did you hear gunshots?

36:50.295 --> 36:53.123
- Why did I come here?
- Because you're scared.

36:53.776 --> 36:57.476
- No, to protect you!
- Well, this isn't a mouse
problem.

36:57.519 --> 36:58.955
What is that supposed to mean?

36:58.999 --> 37:01.436
It means our livesmight be in danger, so come on!

37:01.480 --> 37:04.265
No, no, no!
I really think we ought to...

37:04.309 --> 37:06.224
We ought to
let the police handle this.

37:06.267 --> 37:09.139
What? No, if we're under attack,I'd like to know!

37:15.320 --> 37:16.625
Fuck.

37:23.502 --> 37:26.287
Okay, all clear.
Let's get back to our rooms.
Come on.

37:26.331 --> 37:29.682
No, you go. I'm gonna find out
what's happening outside.

37:30.944 --> 37:32.032
Okay.

37:32.946 --> 37:33.903
What?

37:34.948 --> 37:36.515
- Nothing.
- What are you looking at?

37:37.472 --> 37:40.301
Nothing! Nothing at all.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.912
- Is there something on me?
- No, no!

37:42.956 --> 37:45.088
- I don't think so.
- What do you mean?

37:45.132 --> 37:48.004
- Either there is or there
isn't!
- Alright, look...

37:48.048 --> 37:50.355
It's stupid, I know
but earlier today, Ben...

37:50.398 --> 37:53.445
Casanova,
he was saying something about
your...

37:55.098 --> 37:57.536
Adam's apple being big...

37:57.579 --> 37:59.364
It's a joke, obviously,
but I think...

37:59.407 --> 38:02.062
- And you believe him, do you?
- No.

38:02.105 --> 38:03.455
Obviously not.

38:03.498 --> 38:07.285
But the story you said
about your name...

38:07.328 --> 38:09.287
I thought maybe
you might have made it up.

38:09.330 --> 38:10.549
Okay, you know what...

38:11.245 --> 38:12.377
Touch them.

38:14.379 --> 38:15.989
- What?
- Touch them!

38:16.250 --> 38:17.730
Alright!

38:17.773 --> 38:21.342
- Authentic enough for you?
- Yeah, good. Really good.

38:21.386 --> 38:24.258
I'm not a doctor and surgerycan work wonders, these days...

38:24.302 --> 38:26.652
- For fuck sake! How about this?
- Okay.

38:26.695 --> 38:27.566
No.

38:28.567 --> 38:30.003
You're a girl. I get it.

38:31.613 --> 38:32.962
What?

38:33.006 --> 38:35.008
Don't look at me like that!
This is your fault!

38:35.661 --> 38:36.966
It's not that.

38:37.227 --> 38:38.881
It's just the fear that comes.

38:38.925 --> 38:41.493
I get really turned on
by dangerous situations.

38:41.536 --> 38:43.059
- You do?
- Yeah!

38:45.192 --> 38:49.544
I really wanna know what's goingon,but I'd love to sleep with you.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.851
Oh yeah?
We could toss for it.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.462
Yeah?

38:54.506 --> 38:57.378
Not that you're my type.
Quite the opposite, in fact.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.293
But you know, you're here.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.468
We're here...

39:01.817 --> 39:03.166
The danger...

39:04.124 --> 39:05.604
How are you with velcro?

39:06.648 --> 39:08.258
What?

39:08.302 --> 39:11.349
What? You're joking!
I knew you were joking!

39:11.610 --> 39:13.176
You can't pull the wool over myeyes!

39:14.482 --> 39:15.657
Wait.

39:16.441 --> 39:17.355
Come on. Come on!

39:18.312 --> 39:21.359
Wait, what do you mean, "come
on"?
Don't go towards the gunfire!

39:21.402 --> 39:23.578
Okay, wait for me!

39:25.406 --> 39:26.625
You dark beauty!

39:32.500 --> 39:34.154
What's that, over there?

39:37.679 --> 39:39.159
Check the perimeter.

39:41.944 --> 39:44.686
- We should check their pulses.- Really?

39:44.730 --> 39:45.905
You never know.

39:49.169 --> 39:50.997
- He's alive!
- Really?

39:51.780 --> 39:52.912
No!

39:56.089 --> 39:58.308
- Holy shit! What the fuck?
- Halt!

39:58.570 --> 40:01.834
- We heard gunshots.
- Do you always run toward
gunfire?

40:01.877 --> 40:05.185
- We thought we were under
attack.
- Leave this to the
professionals!

40:05.228 --> 40:06.360
Is that what you told them?

40:07.448 --> 40:09.189
Stay here.
I'm taking these two back
inside.

40:09.450 --> 40:12.801
- Tell us what happened first.- You're not safe in the garden.

40:13.062 --> 40:14.716
- Go back inside.
- What the fuck is going on?

40:14.977 --> 40:16.718
I heard gunshots.

40:16.762 --> 40:17.632
Jesus!

40:20.809 --> 40:22.202
Are you people volunteers?

40:22.463 --> 40:24.596
I demand to speak
to a real police officer!

40:24.639 --> 40:25.684
Look...

40:28.382 --> 40:30.428
Don't panic.
Go back inside.

40:30.689 --> 40:33.474
Go to your rooms.
We're taking care of this.

40:33.735 --> 40:36.564
The security cameras
will be back on again shortly.

40:36.608 --> 40:38.697
- They were off?
- Alright, enough!

40:38.740 --> 40:40.089
Go, go!

40:40.742 --> 40:44.485
Did you see the old man?
He was skewered like a kebab.

40:46.618 --> 40:50.317
If we get out of here alive,I'm suing those bastard police.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.187
I'm gonna...

40:55.453 --> 40:57.150
I thought
they took everybody's phones.

40:58.804 --> 41:00.109
Wait, Ben...

41:02.111 --> 41:03.330
Where is it coming from?

41:10.772 --> 41:12.339
Whose room is this?

41:13.035 --> 41:14.384
Ben Lyk's.

41:19.999 --> 41:22.088
A Ben Lyk that likes guns!

41:24.264 --> 41:25.874
It must be the killer's.

41:25.918 --> 41:28.486
Right...
Let's hide and wait for him.

41:28.747 --> 41:30.531
Or call for help?

41:31.663 --> 41:32.707
Shit!

41:33.578 --> 41:34.622
Shit!

41:52.248 --> 41:53.467
Oh, my God!

41:55.208 --> 41:56.209
What did you do?

41:56.252 --> 41:57.645
I didn't mean to.

41:58.733 --> 41:59.821
That was cold.

42:00.082 --> 42:02.128
What the fuck just happened?

42:02.171 --> 42:04.391
I saw him
coming out of his room with a
gun.

42:04.434 --> 42:07.481
He pointed it at me
so I jumped on him.

42:11.441 --> 42:12.399
He hasn't got a gun!

42:12.660 --> 42:14.532
He must have dropped it
in the corridor.

42:15.054 --> 42:16.098
What's going on?

42:17.447 --> 42:19.667
- Wait, it's not mine!
- Drop it!

42:22.931 --> 42:25.281
- Where did you get it?
- It was on the floor, out
there.

42:25.325 --> 42:27.066
I heard gunfire and...

42:27.327 --> 42:28.633
What's going on?

42:28.894 --> 42:29.982
Is he dead?

42:31.374 --> 42:32.332
It was an accident.

42:33.855 --> 42:34.726
Who's that?

42:35.335 --> 42:36.510
Me.

42:38.468 --> 42:42.037
We found a phone and a gun in
the bag
and we were waiting for the
killer.

42:42.081 --> 42:44.779
- The killer's here?
- The old guy and the banker
died!

42:45.867 --> 42:47.303
- What happened?
- We don't know!

42:47.565 --> 42:49.349
Whose room is this?

42:49.610 --> 42:51.525
- It's not mine!
- It's not mine!

42:51.569 --> 42:55.224
Mine's across the hallway.
He wardrobe is way too small.

42:57.966 --> 42:59.881
Why are you all looking at me?

43:00.142 --> 43:02.580
- Because I'm black?
- No, we didn't say that!

43:02.841 --> 43:04.233
I didn't even notice!

43:04.494 --> 43:05.626
Everyone's black!

43:08.760 --> 43:09.630
It was his room.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.807
I'm gonna be sick.

43:15.897 --> 43:17.377
That's it!

43:17.769 --> 43:20.336
No one gets out until we find
outwhose room this is! Understood?

43:20.598 --> 43:21.599
Okay, got it.

43:24.993 --> 43:26.691
Just to be clear, it's not mine.

43:29.911 --> 43:32.610
Where are we with the video
surveillance? Can you fix it?

43:33.219 --> 43:35.656
Almost there. Surveillance
screens
should be back on

43:35.917 --> 43:36.831
in a few minutes.

43:37.223 --> 43:38.616
Oh! That is just...

43:45.535 --> 43:46.493
Right.

43:46.536 --> 43:47.886
Take everything out of the bag.

43:54.806 --> 43:55.676
Look!

43:56.329 --> 43:57.678
A rugby top.

43:58.157 --> 44:01.290
- That's definitely his room.
- No, that's hair gel and
shampoo!

44:01.334 --> 44:02.640
He was bold!

44:08.036 --> 44:09.385
Don't move!

44:09.864 --> 44:11.083
Did you?

44:11.344 --> 44:12.388
It's yours, isn't it?

44:15.653 --> 44:18.830
Okay, that's the living room
back on.
Let's try the garden.

44:19.091 --> 44:22.137
Lock all the doors.
Back up is on the way.

44:24.531 --> 44:26.664
I feel all in charge!

44:27.447 --> 44:29.318
You are in charge.

44:31.843 --> 44:34.497
Okay.
First things first.

44:37.109 --> 44:38.676
No, no, no!

44:38.937 --> 44:42.505
There's no need for that.
He's gonna talk. Aren't you?

44:46.771 --> 44:47.597
No.

44:48.294 --> 44:50.992
Why are you trying to kill us?
Huh?

44:54.692 --> 44:55.605
Fuck off.

44:57.085 --> 44:58.217
Finished?

45:10.142 --> 45:12.361
Look, I don't have to take thisshit.

45:12.405 --> 45:14.537
- Police! Help!
- Shut up !

45:14.799 --> 45:16.539
Help!

45:16.583 --> 45:18.324
Okay, look. Not you.

45:19.891 --> 45:22.415
Maybe you should justput that on the floor, for now.

45:23.024 --> 45:25.113
That was an accident. Alright?

45:25.374 --> 45:28.160
An accident with severe
consequences.
But an accident nevertheless!

45:29.552 --> 45:32.207
What the hell is wrong with you?Again?

45:32.468 --> 45:33.687
Fuck!

45:36.690 --> 45:37.691
Get her away from me!

45:37.952 --> 45:39.084
Get her away from me!

45:39.345 --> 45:40.912
- Not until you speak!
- Sorry!

45:41.173 --> 45:42.740
I didn't mean it, alright?

45:43.001 --> 45:45.046
"Sorry"? You fucking idiot!
You just shot me!

45:45.307 --> 45:46.308
No need for insults!

45:47.657 --> 45:48.615
Stop!

45:49.964 --> 45:51.183
What do you wanna know?

45:53.402 --> 45:54.882
Why are you trying to kill us?

45:58.407 --> 45:59.887
My name's not Ben Lyk.

46:00.758 --> 46:02.411
It's Paul Leonard.

46:06.502 --> 46:09.244
I killed and took the place
of the only black Ben Lyk in
London.

46:11.333 --> 46:13.422
I made a fake ID and I took hisplace

46:13.683 --> 46:15.163
before the police rounded us allup.

46:16.034 --> 46:18.036
Why would you do that, dude?

46:19.124 --> 46:20.647
Are you weird?

46:21.126 --> 46:23.171
There's a gang war in London.

46:23.215 --> 46:25.130
It's been in the news all this
week.

46:25.173 --> 46:27.393
The four big bosses have been
killed.

46:27.436 --> 46:30.309
The people I work for
killed the last one a few days
ago.

46:30.570 --> 46:31.919
O'Sullivan was his name.

46:31.963 --> 46:34.792
So sorry,
what's that got to do with us?

46:35.662 --> 46:38.360
Someone called Ben Lyk

46:38.621 --> 46:39.971
witnessed O'Sullivan getting
killed.

46:41.146 --> 46:42.451
He filmed the whole thing.

46:42.712 --> 46:44.410
Including the people who'd doneit.

46:49.458 --> 46:51.243
But not before
dropping his gym membership.

46:58.990 --> 47:01.644
So my boss looked up
all the Ben Lyks in London.

47:01.688 --> 47:03.777
And in order not to take any
chances,

47:04.778 --> 47:06.345
he told me to kill them all.

47:06.388 --> 47:07.302
Great!

47:08.434 --> 47:10.436
So we're locked in a house withthe
very person we're trying to
avoid!

47:10.697 --> 47:13.831
Wait. So it's a guy.
That means I can go.

47:16.137 --> 47:17.660
Let me get this straight.
We're here

47:17.922 --> 47:19.401
because some dickhead with a
camera

47:19.662 --> 47:22.361
couldn't keep his noseout of other people's business!

47:22.622 --> 47:24.580
I'm a little tea pot short and
stout,

47:24.842 --> 47:28.628
Here is my handle, here is my
spout,
When I get...

47:29.498 --> 47:30.891
Wait a minute!

47:30.935 --> 47:32.980
That camera's not on.

47:33.024 --> 47:35.461
Something's not right.
We need to get up there.

47:35.765 --> 47:36.897
Call you back, sweetie!

47:38.464 --> 47:41.510
- So you killed all five Ben
Lyks.
- Just the first three.

47:42.120 --> 47:43.904
The killings here are someone
else.

47:43.948 --> 47:45.340
Then you must have an
accomplice!

47:45.601 --> 47:46.472
No.

47:47.125 --> 47:48.387
I work alone.

47:48.648 --> 47:50.737
- Don't bullshit me!
- He's probably like me.

47:50.998 --> 47:54.262
- Murderers are self-employed.
- Judging by the mess you've
made,

47:54.523 --> 47:57.178
- he's probably hired someone
else.
- It's irrelevant now.

47:57.222 --> 47:59.659
One thinghe doesn't tolerate is a snitch.

47:59.702 --> 48:01.879
So either way,I'm as dead as the rest of you.

48:04.272 --> 48:07.362
Open the door!
Open this fucking door!

48:09.712 --> 48:10.583
What's going on?

48:14.021 --> 48:16.197
- He's poisoned himself!
- What?

48:16.502 --> 48:17.851
Shit!

48:18.852 --> 48:21.289
We should try CPR!
Mouth to mouth!

48:22.029 --> 48:23.204
Jesus!

48:28.427 --> 48:30.124
Taking the positive

48:30.385 --> 48:32.083
from this dreadful series of
events,

48:32.126 --> 48:34.999
at least we know who killed
the first three Ben Lyks and
why.

48:35.260 --> 48:38.959
And taking the negative
from this dreadful series of
events,

48:39.003 --> 48:41.962
- we know he's not the only
killer!
- He may be lying.

48:42.006 --> 48:43.268
Why would he do that?

48:43.529 --> 48:46.271
He's a murderer!
They're not known for their
honesty.

48:46.532 --> 48:49.796
- That's right, Scott. Very
good.
- You're all ignoring the real
issue!

48:49.839 --> 48:52.494
- It's staring you right in theface.
- What's that?

48:52.755 --> 48:56.368
The video! If whoever took the
video
would just hand it over to the
gang,

48:56.411 --> 48:58.500
we could put an end to this.

48:58.544 --> 49:01.982
It's very cowardly that
they haven't step forward
already.

49:02.026 --> 49:03.853
Cowardly or cautionary?

49:04.115 --> 49:06.073
Yes, we shouldn't be
doing deals with criminals.

49:06.334 --> 49:07.335
Coward!

49:08.162 --> 49:12.732
She's got a point, though.
That video might give us some
clues.

49:12.775 --> 49:16.388
But that would require
one of you to step forward.

49:17.084 --> 49:20.696
I know it's hard. You are
responsible
for the deaths of eight people

49:20.958 --> 49:25.223
and the use of over 100 000
pounds
worth of police time.

49:25.484 --> 49:27.790
But I can assure you,
you will be protected.

49:29.749 --> 49:31.185
It was probably the vicar.

49:31.969 --> 49:33.274
Well, it wasn't me.

49:34.232 --> 49:35.450
No.

49:45.547 --> 49:49.073
Hi, you've reached Roberto.
Leave me a message.

49:49.116 --> 49:50.988
Robbie, it's Ben.

49:51.466 --> 49:55.644
I need you to do something for
me.
It's very important.

50:14.054 --> 50:15.621
Come on Robbie!

50:15.664 --> 50:17.536
Listen to the message!

50:28.982 --> 50:30.810
Robbie, it's Ben.

50:30.853 --> 50:34.553
I need you to do something for
me.
It's very important.

50:34.596 --> 50:37.425
- Fuck sake!
- I need you to go find...

51:36.180 --> 51:38.834
Ben, you twat!

51:47.800 --> 51:49.497
Robbie, pick up the phone!

52:03.032 --> 52:03.990
Jesus.

52:04.033 --> 52:05.383
- Let me in.
- Why?

52:05.426 --> 52:07.907
What the fuck!
Just let me in!

52:07.950 --> 52:08.951
Okay.

52:09.561 --> 52:11.563
There's something up
with the hipster.

52:11.606 --> 52:13.042
Yeah, he's a twat.

52:13.086 --> 52:16.307
I was looking in his room
and he's making something.

52:16.568 --> 52:19.092
Probably a green bubble hat
to match his stupid trousers.

52:19.136 --> 52:21.399
I don't know about you,
but I'm not taking any more
risks.

52:21.660 --> 52:24.619
As far as I'm concerned,
everyone out there is guilty.

52:24.663 --> 52:26.969
- I agree!
- Great. Then give me the gun.

52:27.274 --> 52:28.449
No, no way!

52:28.971 --> 52:31.409
- Give me the gun!
- I'm not giving a gun to a
murderer!

52:31.452 --> 52:33.454
- It was an accident!
- It wasn't an accident.

52:33.498 --> 52:38.416
A ploy, is what it was. To
disguise
the fact that you're the
murderer.

52:39.634 --> 52:42.028
Ben... I might think you're a
dick,

52:42.289 --> 52:43.856
but I don't want you dead.

52:43.899 --> 52:45.901
Which bit of that
is even a compliment?

52:48.382 --> 52:49.557
What?

52:56.738 --> 52:58.827
I'm not falling for that one
again,
Thailand!

53:41.218 --> 53:42.306
Are you coming?

53:43.524 --> 53:47.049
What did I ever do to you?
This is abuse!

53:47.093 --> 53:49.356
Please don't kill me.
I promise, I'm not...

53:49.400 --> 53:52.272
Get out of your rooms!
We're leaving the house!

53:52.316 --> 53:54.927
- Thank god. Help!
- Shut up!

53:54.970 --> 53:57.016
Thank God! Jesus!

53:59.888 --> 54:02.326
You ain't gonna believe
what I've just found.

54:02.369 --> 54:04.850
An apology
for that awful shirt you're
wearing?

54:19.299 --> 54:20.996
Take this video down.

54:21.693 --> 54:23.477
It ain't gonna be easy.

54:23.521 --> 54:25.305
People have already shared it.

54:25.349 --> 54:27.525
Press has probably seen it, by
now.

54:27.568 --> 54:30.963
- He only posted one video?
- Yeah.

54:31.006 --> 54:32.878
The account just got created.

54:34.358 --> 54:35.924
And the name is Ben Lyk?

54:38.013 --> 54:39.972
We must have missed one.

54:40.015 --> 54:42.583
That is exactly
what he wants us to think.

54:43.932 --> 54:45.456
I don't like to take chances.

54:45.499 --> 54:49.938
When I say "kill all the Ben
Lyks",
I mean...

54:49.982 --> 54:50.852
Kill them all!

54:51.375 --> 54:53.464
- Which one do you prefer?
- What's he doing?

54:53.725 --> 54:56.597
I wanna look good
if I'm gonna die. That one?

54:56.641 --> 54:58.686
I love the blue one.

55:00.993 --> 55:03.387
I'm so sick and tired
of talking to you, right now.

55:03.430 --> 55:06.041
- Just make a decision.
- Put your jacket on.

55:07.521 --> 55:10.045
- Everybody out!
- Hurry up!

55:10.872 --> 55:12.918
I want a bulletproof vest!

55:13.222 --> 55:15.616
We'll see what we can do
but you have to come out!

55:15.660 --> 55:17.226
We're leaving now!

55:17.488 --> 55:19.141
And I want a helmet

55:19.185 --> 55:20.926
and two armed bodyguards.

55:21.187 --> 55:22.884
It'd be great
if they could wear denim.

55:22.928 --> 55:25.496
That's probably not gonna
happen.

55:25.539 --> 55:27.976
I want them just for me.

55:28.237 --> 55:30.588
- I don't trust anyone anymore.- He's buying some time!

55:30.849 --> 55:33.547
He's one of them.
I saw you making something!

55:33.591 --> 55:35.375
See? People are spying on me.

55:35.636 --> 55:38.030
- He was making something!
- No, I wasn't.

55:38.291 --> 55:42.208
Yes, you were! I saw you,you were sawing. What are you upto?

55:45.385 --> 55:46.995
I was wanking.

55:51.435 --> 55:53.741
Yes, sir.
How many units did you send?

55:54.307 --> 55:55.221
Right.

55:55.700 --> 55:56.962
Yes, they're getting ready.

55:57.223 --> 55:58.224
Thank you, sir.

55:59.399 --> 56:01.445
Inspector,I've got something to show you.

56:01.488 --> 56:04.012
I don't have time.
Back up is almost here.

56:04.622 --> 56:06.145
The video of O'Sullivan's
murder.

56:08.452 --> 56:09.583
Where did you get that?

56:10.062 --> 56:11.455
Online.

56:13.848 --> 56:14.980
Give me a second.

56:16.242 --> 56:17.461
Clive...

56:17.896 --> 56:20.594
There's nothing else I can do.

56:20.638 --> 56:24.468
She doesn't want to sleepand I don't have time for this!

56:26.034 --> 56:27.427
Kill them all.

56:27.471 --> 56:28.733
Done.

56:32.214 --> 56:34.565
Officer, may I? Please?

56:35.348 --> 56:38.133
- For a moment.
- I don't think that's a good
idea.

56:40.135 --> 56:42.094
Ben, it's Ben.

56:42.137 --> 56:43.617
Listen, I think you...

56:44.052 --> 56:45.619
Actually, listen all of you.

56:46.881 --> 56:49.188
You've got nothing
to worry about anymore.

56:50.145 --> 56:51.582
It was me.

56:52.060 --> 56:55.324
I filmed the murder and I
couldn't
deal with the guilt anymore.

56:55.368 --> 56:58.110
So I've posted the video online.

56:58.153 --> 57:00.939
The whole world can see it now
so there's no reason

57:01.200 --> 57:03.202
to kill us anymore.
We're all safe!

57:05.596 --> 57:06.858
I am no coward!

57:07.119 --> 57:10.165
- You what?
- I really have to take this.

57:11.036 --> 57:11.906
Hello?

57:12.516 --> 57:13.865
Robbie?

57:13.908 --> 57:17.651
The place was a bugger to find
but I'm outside.

57:17.695 --> 57:19.871
I thought
I could film all this for you.

57:20.132 --> 57:21.176
For your channel.

57:21.220 --> 57:23.440
Robbie, that is adorable.

57:23.483 --> 57:24.571
So all this is your fault?

57:26.181 --> 57:27.139
Hello?

57:30.490 --> 57:32.753
You're the reason they want to
kill us and you didn't say
anything?

57:32.797 --> 57:35.495
- I'm a victim, too!- You didn't need to involve us.

57:35.539 --> 57:37.932
- We didn't do anything.
- But we never would have met!

57:37.976 --> 57:39.412
I'm going to kill you!

57:40.718 --> 57:43.764
How was I supposed to know
they would kill all the Ben
Lyks?

57:43.808 --> 57:46.680
You should have
told the police straight away!

57:46.724 --> 57:48.334
I was scared!

57:48.377 --> 57:51.903
Until she pointed out it was
cowardly
and I'm not a coward!

57:52.164 --> 57:54.688
You're a prick!
How could you do that, Ben?

57:54.949 --> 57:56.037
You put us all in danger!

57:56.951 --> 57:58.562
She's right, you're a prick!

58:14.447 --> 58:15.883
I've tried everything.

58:15.927 --> 58:18.016
There's only so many times

58:18.277 --> 58:21.454
I can march the Duke of York
up to the top of the bloody
hill!

58:21.715 --> 58:23.761
- Ma'm?
- Hang on, Clive.

58:24.022 --> 58:27.547
- Who else has a tattoo like
that?
- I don't know...

58:27.591 --> 58:28.592
David Beckham?

58:28.853 --> 58:29.810
Scott!

58:29.854 --> 58:30.637
Yep!

58:37.470 --> 58:39.037
Okay, okay!

58:39.080 --> 58:40.691
Let me go, I'm done!

58:41.474 --> 58:44.172
You're just as bad as them,
if you're trying to kill me!

58:45.391 --> 58:47.959
Enough! Enough!
Get off him!

59:08.936 --> 59:10.634
- What happened?
- This.

59:14.942 --> 59:17.597
- They're back!
- It came from the garden.

59:17.641 --> 59:20.426
- Alright! That's it!
- Okay.

59:20.687 --> 59:23.560
I'm handing him over to them
so they let us go.

59:23.864 --> 59:25.518
I shouldn't have gotten these
boots.

59:27.825 --> 59:29.827
Come on. Come on.

59:32.656 --> 59:33.526
Come on!

59:44.885 --> 59:47.148
Come on! We're going downstairsnow!

59:47.409 --> 59:49.020
- Can I at least take my bag?
- No!

59:49.063 --> 59:50.587
Come on, let her take her bag.

59:51.500 --> 59:52.980
I said no!

59:53.241 --> 59:55.374
Now fucking downstairs, now!

59:55.417 --> 59:56.636
Now!

59:58.420 --> 59:59.770
- Go now!
- Alright, got it!

1:00:02.729 --> 1:00:06.690
It's no luck, is it?Statistically, it would be a bitodd:

1:00:06.994 --> 1:00:08.648
- a safe house full of
murderers.
- Listen,

1:00:08.909 --> 1:00:11.259
you should leave this to us.
We know what we're doing.

1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:13.131
- What the fuck!
- Shit.

1:00:14.001 --> 1:00:15.568
What the fuck is going on?

1:00:18.179 --> 1:00:20.660
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1:00:21.487 --> 1:00:22.749
Fuck you!

1:00:44.510 --> 1:00:45.554
This way.

1:00:51.604 --> 1:00:52.474
Fuck!

1:01:04.399 --> 1:01:06.227
We're gonna die here
because of you!

1:01:06.271 --> 1:01:08.099
- I said I'm sorry.
- That's not gonna help!

1:01:08.142 --> 1:01:09.796
I know. Sorry.

1:01:10.797 --> 1:01:14.018
If I'd know today was gonna be
my last day on earth,

1:01:14.279 --> 1:01:15.672
I would have shagged you
earlier.

1:01:15.715 --> 1:01:16.847
That's your loss.

1:01:16.890 --> 1:01:18.500
We both know it's your loss.

1:01:19.153 --> 1:01:20.198
Fair enough.

1:01:23.810 --> 1:01:26.204
You're actually
a really nice boy, Ben Lyk.

1:01:27.422 --> 1:01:29.424
You're not so bad yourself, BenLyk.

1:01:33.951 --> 1:01:36.475
- You are very difficult to
read!
- Can I tell you something?

1:01:36.518 --> 1:01:38.129
It's now or never.

1:01:38.172 --> 1:01:39.957
My real name isn't Ben.

1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:41.610
- I know, it's Bee, right?
- No.

1:01:41.654 --> 1:01:44.048
It was Ben and now it's Melissa.

1:01:44.701 --> 1:01:46.050
You've lost me.

1:01:46.093 --> 1:01:48.269
Six months ago, my name was Ben.

1:01:48.313 --> 1:01:52.143
Now it's Melissa. I'm here
becauseI forgot to update my passport.

1:01:53.797 --> 1:01:55.886
Do you remember what Casanova
said?

1:01:58.932 --> 1:02:02.022
Oh, fuck!
Well, nobody's perfect.

1:03:32.896 --> 1:03:34.419
Kill him!

1:03:35.507 --> 1:03:38.205
Get closer to him!

1:03:38.249 --> 1:03:39.076
Closer!

1:03:46.387 --> 1:03:47.345
Fuck!

1:03:47.606 --> 1:03:49.608
How are we supposed to survive

1:03:49.869 --> 1:03:52.089
if even the police
are trying to kill us?

1:03:52.567 --> 1:03:53.960
Do you think he's alone?

1:03:55.527 --> 1:03:56.833
I don't know.

1:03:57.529 --> 1:03:59.792
How many are you?

1:04:00.488 --> 1:04:02.055
As many as it takes.

1:04:02.882 --> 1:04:04.884
Who do you work for?

1:04:04.928 --> 1:04:06.451
Scotland Yard.

1:04:07.278 --> 1:04:09.497
Could you please get him
to tell us who he works for?

1:04:09.541 --> 1:04:10.803
Yep. Alright, come on!

1:04:11.064 --> 1:04:12.631
Okay, okay.

1:04:13.980 --> 1:04:15.199
I work for O'Sullivan.

1:04:15.503 --> 1:04:17.027
- What?
- What?

1:04:17.549 --> 1:04:20.291
He's dead!
O'Sullivan is dead!

1:04:21.553 --> 1:04:23.250
- Can I shoot him now?
- No.

1:04:23.947 --> 1:04:26.253
No, wait. He's not dead.

1:04:27.211 --> 1:04:28.429
It was a set up.

1:04:28.690 --> 1:04:31.606
So he could disappear, retire
quietly

1:04:31.650 --> 1:04:33.652
and let his organisation
take over London.

1:04:34.522 --> 1:04:36.742
Wait.
So who did I see getting
murdered?

1:04:37.003 --> 1:04:38.787
That was some homeless bloke.

1:04:38.831 --> 1:04:41.573
It was easy.With my contacts in the police,

1:04:41.616 --> 1:04:45.011
we were able to officially
identify the body as
O'Sullivan's.

1:04:47.057 --> 1:04:49.450
O'Sullivan had the three main
bosses
in London killed.

1:04:50.364 --> 1:04:52.018
And he staged his own death.

1:04:52.279 --> 1:04:54.673
So that nobody could
take revenge on him and his
crew.

1:04:54.934 --> 1:04:57.719
And with all the other gangs
confused and disorganised,

1:04:57.763 --> 1:05:00.157
his crew can
quietly take over the city

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:02.376
as they've been
planning to for years.

1:05:03.987 --> 1:05:05.902
There's one thing I can't
explain...

1:05:06.163 --> 1:05:08.382
Why a man with the name
O'Sullivan

1:05:08.426 --> 1:05:09.644
is French.

1:05:10.602 --> 1:05:12.473
Where are your accomplices?

1:05:12.517 --> 1:05:14.911
- Everywhere.
- We've established that. But
where?

1:05:14.954 --> 1:05:17.174
- Can I shoot him, now?
- No, wait!

1:05:17.217 --> 1:05:18.088
Maybe we can me a deal.

1:05:18.697 --> 1:05:19.567
Fuck me!

1:05:19.828 --> 1:05:21.526
I told you to wait!

1:05:21.787 --> 1:05:23.832
Sorry, I just got a bit nervous.

1:05:25.573 --> 1:05:27.880
- Bloody hell...
- Yes! Come on!

1:05:34.495 --> 1:05:37.411
What the fuck!
Who the fuck are these guys?

1:05:37.455 --> 1:05:39.370
He killed the whole fucking
building!

1:05:40.762 --> 1:05:43.069
Okay, go. Go!

1:05:45.463 --> 1:05:46.464
Give me the keys.

1:05:46.507 --> 1:05:47.944
- I'm driving.
- No. Really?

1:05:48.205 --> 1:05:50.642
- You can't even fire a gun!
- Get in the car!

1:05:52.035 --> 1:05:53.297
Go! Go!

1:05:54.776 --> 1:05:55.647
What?

1:05:55.908 --> 1:05:58.084
- Go!
- I'm a virgin.

1:05:58.824 --> 1:06:00.260
- A virgin?
- Yeah.

1:06:00.304 --> 1:06:02.741
- You mean as a man, or as a
woman?
- Stop it!

1:06:03.437 --> 1:06:06.832
I'd really like you
to be my first time.

1:06:10.053 --> 1:06:12.316
I don't thinknow is the actual time for that.

1:06:12.359 --> 1:06:15.232
- We should focus on getting
out...- Don't be such a coward, Ben !

1:06:15.275 --> 1:06:17.625
- I am not a coward!
- I'm just asking.

1:06:17.669 --> 1:06:20.193
I just went upstairs
and blew a guy's brain!

1:06:21.978 --> 1:06:23.196
I'm sorry.

1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:25.416
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell.

1:06:26.243 --> 1:06:29.159
I'm sorry.
I didn't realise you felt this
way.

1:06:29.420 --> 1:06:31.770
Look, Bee... Melissa!

1:06:32.423 --> 1:06:34.164
You're the most beautiful thingI've ever seen.

1:06:34.425 --> 1:06:37.080
I haven't felt this way
since I watched Mulan, okay?

1:06:39.256 --> 1:06:40.605
And yes...

1:06:40.648 --> 1:06:42.737
Yes, I will take your virginity.

1:06:42.781 --> 1:06:44.565
I will be your first.

1:06:44.609 --> 1:06:45.914
Of course I will!

1:06:46.176 --> 1:06:47.699
- I fucking love you! Okay?
- Yeah?

1:06:47.742 --> 1:06:49.005
Yes!

1:06:49.048 --> 1:06:50.919
So no need to cry.

1:06:55.272 --> 1:06:58.188
- What?
- Every fucking time!

1:06:58.449 --> 1:07:01.234
You bitch! I knew it!
How do you keep doing this?

1:07:25.606 --> 1:07:27.521
Fuck you, Scott!

1:07:27.565 --> 1:07:29.349
Just let it go!

1:07:45.104 --> 1:07:46.410
Fuck!

1:08:03.122 --> 1:08:06.212
No, Scott! Please!

1:08:06.256 --> 1:08:07.953
Please, don't kill me!

1:08:07.996 --> 1:08:09.694
I'm not worth it, I swear!

1:08:09.737 --> 1:08:12.653
I won't say anything
about what I saw here!

1:08:12.697 --> 1:08:14.133
Please!

1:08:14.177 --> 1:08:17.049
No one is even
gonna remember who I am!

1:08:17.093 --> 1:08:20.748
What do you want?
I've got 2 000...

1:08:21.445 --> 1:08:24.578
2 000 pounds in my building
society.

1:08:24.622 --> 1:08:26.624
I'll be sure to text you my
details.

1:08:26.885 --> 1:08:29.105
I am begging you, Scott.
Please...

1:08:34.806 --> 1:08:36.373
So it's done.

1:08:37.548 --> 1:08:39.027
Not quite.

1:08:40.855 --> 1:08:42.248
What do you mean?

1:08:43.641 --> 1:08:44.772
Where is Scott?

1:08:48.428 --> 1:08:49.342
Scott's dead.

1:08:51.039 --> 1:08:53.955
But not only that.
Take a closer look.

1:08:56.958 --> 1:08:58.134
Please don't kill...

1:09:03.051 --> 1:09:07.447
The police found Scott's body. But the video guy wasn't there.

1:09:08.622 --> 1:09:11.147
He wasnowhere to be seen in his place.

1:09:11.756 --> 1:09:14.150
But he'd been there recently.
His friend Roberto

1:09:14.411 --> 1:09:16.239
told me everything.

1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:18.110
Before he so...

1:09:18.545 --> 1:09:20.156
tragically passed away.

1:09:21.461 --> 1:09:23.507
Nice guy, though.

1:09:23.550 --> 1:09:25.639
Shame I had to take care of him.

1:09:30.601 --> 1:09:32.168
He'd seen his friend being
chased.

1:09:34.344 --> 1:09:36.259
Decided he should help.

1:09:37.999 --> 1:09:40.393
So he picked up
the first gun he could find

1:09:42.830 --> 1:09:44.354
and followed Scott.

1:09:46.312 --> 1:09:49.141
He found his friend just as Scott was about to kill him.

1:09:53.798 --> 1:09:55.539
Robbie! Not that arm!

1:10:00.587 --> 1:10:02.894
- You killed him!- What are we gonna do with him?

1:10:03.416 --> 1:10:04.983
Hand him over
to real police officers!

1:10:06.463 --> 1:10:07.812
Come on, let's go.

1:10:08.726 --> 1:10:10.728
What happened to your arm?

1:10:10.989 --> 1:10:12.208
Watch out!

1:10:19.215 --> 1:10:20.477
Mate, we have to go.

1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:23.480
- Stop touching my arm!
- He's dead.

1:10:24.350 --> 1:10:27.179
Wait, I've got an idea.
I want you to film me.

1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:29.094
Now is not the time
to make a video.

1:10:29.137 --> 1:10:31.662
Robbie, just trust me, okay?

1:10:31.705 --> 1:10:35.318
Take the camera and film me
as if you were him, okay?

1:10:35.361 --> 1:10:38.146
Robbie, look.
Point the camera at me,

1:10:38.190 --> 1:10:41.498
fire the gun in the airand I'll pretend like I'm dead,okay?

1:10:41.541 --> 1:10:43.326
- Alright.
- Come on, mate.

1:10:43.369 --> 1:10:44.979
Okay, wait, wait.

1:10:45.937 --> 1:10:47.547
Shit.

1:10:49.070 --> 1:10:49.897
Okay.

1:10:56.339 --> 1:10:58.515
Okay. Alright. Now...

1:11:01.039 --> 1:11:03.563
Ready.
Please don't kill me...

1:11:06.218 --> 1:11:07.785
- Cut!
- Right.

1:11:08.873 --> 1:11:10.178
A little help?

1:11:16.968 --> 1:11:19.275
What's the plan, now?

1:11:20.014 --> 1:11:22.626
I'm gonna get
as far away from here as
possible.

1:11:23.453 --> 1:11:26.107
Your Grandma's in Liverpool,
that's not a bad move.

1:11:26.151 --> 1:11:29.197
No, I was thinking
somewhere a bit further than
that.

1:11:30.634 --> 1:11:32.113
Yeah. Birmingham.

1:11:35.856 --> 1:11:38.946
Hello! I'm Michel Girard!

1:11:38.990 --> 1:11:43.864
What to do when it has not
rained
in paradise for the last 50
days?

1:11:43.908 --> 1:11:46.824
You will need your fitting
swimwear.

1:11:46.867 --> 1:11:48.260
And of course

1:11:48.304 --> 1:11:51.742
your local girl
to apply the sunscreen.

1:11:51.785 --> 1:11:53.961
And here she is now.

1:11:54.005 --> 1:11:56.181
In all her beauty.

1:11:56.224 --> 1:11:58.314
- Hello my darling, how are you?
- Sexy!

1:11:58.357 --> 1:12:00.185
Thank you very much.

1:12:00.228 --> 1:12:01.360
What can I say?

1:12:01.404 --> 1:12:03.362
- They love me here.
- Very sexy!

1:12:03.406 --> 1:12:04.972
Thank you so much.

1:12:05.016 --> 1:12:08.541
To all my fans around the world,
I say:

1:12:08.585 --> 1:12:11.327
Thanks and goodbye.
See you soon!

1:12:11.892 --> 1:12:13.894
He's changed his name.

1:12:14.504 --> 1:12:16.027
To Michel Girard.

1:12:27.952 --> 1:12:30.215
Then kill all the Michel Girard.

1:12:30.476 --> 1:12:31.782
Oh, God!

1:12:53.064 --> 1:12:54.457
And take your shirt off.

1:13:24.138 --> 1:13:26.402
Okay, it's over.
You pay me now.

1:13:26.445 --> 1:13:28.447
I know,
but you said I could have 20
minutes.

1:13:28.491 --> 1:13:30.580
- You pay me now!
- Okay, I understand!

1:13:30.623 --> 1:13:32.016
I will!

1:13:32.059 --> 1:13:34.540
Alright, Jesus Christ!
Just give me my towel back!

1:13:34.584 --> 1:13:36.499
- Now!
- Jesus, alright! Fine!

1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:38.239
Help!
