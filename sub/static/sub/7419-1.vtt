01:30.360 --> 01:31.759
Pam? This is Shelley, my girlfriend.
Hi.

01:31.760 --> 01:34.439
Hi. How are you?
I'm Richard and I'm thirsty.

01:34.440 --> 01:37.211

What is happening?

01:54.960 --> 01:56.999
This is for you from all of us.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.239
Hey, Shelley! Thank you.
Shelley, look at this.

02:00.240 --> 02:02.359
Wait a minute. What happened
here, did everybody sign this?

02:02.360 --> 02:05.399
WOMAN: Yeah, everybody signed.
Fabulous. Thank you.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.959
RICHARD: Where'd you sign this?
WOMAN: I signed it inside.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.446
Good, I got some news.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.279
There was an agent
in the house tonight,

02:11.280 --> 02:14.919
and he says he thinks this play
might be good enough for Broadway.

02:14.920 --> 02:17.239

Yeah. I know.

02:25.640 --> 02:30.129
Okay. Now, I think this thing
that we ought to do here is...

Everybody get a piece? Here
you go. Let me trade you that.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.239

I have no idea.

07:00.360 --> 07:01.759
What about the play?

07:01.760 --> 07:03.679
Well, it isn't done.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.159
Okay. When will it be done?

07:06.160 --> 07:07.599
I don't know.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.202
Oh, my God. Richard, there are
people waiting for that play.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.959

Okay, thanks a lot.

08:59.920 --> 09:03.329
This your first time here, Mr...
Collier.

09:03.480 --> 09:06.126
Yeah. For some reason,
I never got around to coming here.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.759
I always heard how
nice it was, though.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.079
When was that?

09:09.080 --> 09:10.519
About eight years ago.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.519
See, I used to be a student
up at Millfield College.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.999
Really?
You been here that long?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.770
Why, I've been here since 1910.

(CHUCKLES) 1910?
Uh-huh.

09:31.880 --> 09:34.119
Came here with my parents
when I was five years old.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.243
Really?
My father was a desk clerk.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.531
I used to drive him crazy
playing ball in the lobby.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.279

Okay, let's see now.
Here you go.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.639
Thank you, Mr. Collier.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.919
If there's anything I can do
for you, just let me know.

10:03.920 --> 10:07.119
My name's Arthur and I live in
the bungalow behind the hotel.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.129

10:12.200 --> 10:13.765
Have we ever met before?

10:15.560 --> 10:18.445
Have we ever...
No, no. I don't think so.

10:19.480 --> 10:22.879
No. No. I'm sure we haven't.
Have a nice stay here, Mr. Collier.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.491

10:47.520 --> 10:49.559

Yeah, when do you open?

10:49.560 --> 10:51.171

Yes, sir.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.086
Yes, Mr. Collier.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.683
Arthur, you know,
in the Hall of History,

13:43.760 --> 13:45.530
there's a photograph,
a young woman.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.079
There's no nameplate.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.726
Yes, that's Elise McKenna.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.607
She was a famous
actress in her day.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.919
Starred in a play
in the hotel theater.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.805
I'm sorry. Did you say
there was a theater here?

13:58.480 --> 13:59.806
Down by the lake.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.281
Really?

14:01.440 --> 14:02.971
When was this play done?

14:04.080 --> 14:05.566
Oh, um...

14:05.800 --> 14:07.331
1912.

Arthur. Hi. Listen.

15:40.520 --> 15:43.279
Could you take my luggage and put it
back in my suite? Great. Thanks a lot.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.759
And can you tell me where
the nearest library is?

15:44.760 --> 15:46.644
In town.
Right past the church.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.686
Great. Look out.
Thanks. Terrific!

15:51.040 --> 15:54.722
Thanks a lot.
See you around, Arthur.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.091
Yeah.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.366

18:24.040 --> 18:26.199
Yes?
Hello, yes. Miss Roberts?

18:26.200 --> 18:28.679
Yes.
Hi. My name's Richard Collier.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.119
And I just read your book
on famous American actresses,

18:31.120 --> 18:32.359
and I really enjoyed it a lot.

18:32.360 --> 18:33.721
What is it you want?

18:34.440 --> 18:36.404
Information about Elise McKenna.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.565
What sort of information?

18:40.480 --> 18:43.399
Well, I'm a playwright and I was thinking
about doing a play based on her life.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.719
And of course I'd have to talk...
I'm sorry.

18:44.720 --> 18:47.526
Ma'am, please.
Please, don't.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.449
This is not for a play,
Miss Roberts.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.245
This is something very personal.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.165
I don't understand.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.091
Where did you get that?

19:10.720 --> 19:12.331
She gave it to me, ma'am.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.239
At the opening night
of a play that I wrote

19:14.240 --> 19:16.283
at Millfield College
about eight years ago.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.559
That watch was
very precious to her.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.843
She never, never left
it out of her possession.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.044
It disappeared the night she died.

19:28.360 --> 19:29.846
She died that night?

19:33.240 --> 19:34.965
Won't you come in, please?

19:36.400 --> 19:37.965
Thank you.

19:40.320 --> 19:43.364
I have some things I've been
saving for the theater collection.

19:56.680 --> 19:59.121
That was a costume from
one of the plays she was in.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.290
Miss Roberts, what was she like?

20:06.320 --> 20:08.999
When I knew her,
she was kind and thoughtful.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.569
But she was just too
much within herself.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.448
She seemed empty somehow.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.888
Well, she wasn't
always that way, was she?

20:19.120 --> 20:20.560
No, not at all.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.879
People who knew her
when she was young said

20:22.880 --> 20:25.686
that she was quick and
bright and full of fun.

20:25.800 --> 20:29.561
Strong, willful, not at all
the way she was later.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.559
What made her change?

20:31.560 --> 20:36.607
I don't know, but the change seems
to have taken place about 1912.

20:36.920 --> 20:39.487
After she performed
in a play at the Grand Hotel.

20:44.840 --> 20:47.441
That was her manager,
William Robinson.

20:49.080 --> 20:52.363
Was he really as strange as you
seemed to indicate in the book?

20:53.160 --> 20:55.931
There was something strange
about their relationship.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.371
Wow, look at this.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.839
Hey. May I?

21:03.840 --> 21:05.769
Of course.
This is incredible.

21:05.960 --> 21:09.482
This guy, Finney. He was my
philosophy teacher at Millfield.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.881
Really?
Yeah.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.889
She read that book over and over.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.924
She had that made.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.844
(MUSIC PLAYING)

21:52.640 --> 21:54.285
What is it?

21:55.320 --> 21:57.921
That's my favorite music
in the whole world.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.326
I don't understand
what's happening.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.610
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

22:08.480 --> 22:11.239
Dr. Finney?
You'll have to walk with me, young man.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.039
I have another class.
What's your name?

22:13.040 --> 22:14.319
Collier, sir.
Richard Collier.

22:14.320 --> 22:16.568
Student?
Yes, I was, nine years ago.

22:17.120 --> 22:21.599
Well, I try to make my classes
interesting, but nine years?

22:21.600 --> 22:22.759
What can I do for you?

22:22.760 --> 22:23.999
I have a question for you, sir.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.009
Shoot.
Is time travel possible?

22:27.640 --> 22:29.126
That is a question.

22:30.880 --> 22:34.482
Let me tell you something, Richard, is it?
Yes, sir.

22:36.440 --> 22:41.806
I was in Venice in 1971.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.765
I was staying in a very old hotel.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.689
But I mean, very old.

22:48.960 --> 22:52.289
The structure,
the furnishings, everything.

22:53.760 --> 22:58.329
The atmosphere was aged,
if you follow me.

22:58.680 --> 23:02.407
And my room,
I felt as though it was

23:02.440 --> 23:06.531
a century or more earlier than 1971.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.171
You understand?
Yes, sir.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.000
So, in other words, then, the
location is very important.

23:11.760 --> 23:14.361
Not all important, but essential.

23:14.840 --> 23:16.530
The rest is here.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.168
One afternoon, I...

23:23.600 --> 23:26.724
I was lying down in that room.

23:27.760 --> 23:32.329
All the sights around me,
a part of the past.

23:32.760 --> 23:34.644
Even the sounds I heard,

23:35.000 --> 23:36.999
and I conceived a notion.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.328
What, I asked myself,

23:39.640 --> 23:44.209
if I attempt to hypnotize my mind?

23:44.480 --> 23:49.239
Suggest to it that it isn't 1971,

23:49.240 --> 23:51.283
but 1571.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.239
I closed my eyes

23:53.240 --> 23:57.490
and fed a suggestion into my brain.

23:58.040 --> 24:02.039
It's August, 1571.

24:02.040 --> 24:05.239
I am in the Hotel Del Vecchio,

24:05.240 --> 24:09.525

I would disassociate myself
entirely from the present.

46:45.040 --> 46:46.919
I'm sorry if I startled you.
No, you didn't startle me.

46:46.920 --> 46:48.039
I think I did.

46:48.040 --> 46:50.004
MAN:
I'll take you in to dinner now.

46:52.520 --> 46:54.768
May I speak to you, please?

47:02.240 --> 47:04.044
Anything the matter?

47:06.200 --> 47:08.289
Who was that young man?

47:08.920 --> 47:10.565
I've no idea.

47:10.920 --> 47:12.724
He gave no name?

47:13.280 --> 47:15.079
There was hardly time.

47:15.080 --> 47:17.123
You were conversing, McKenna.

47:17.560 --> 47:18.761
No.

47:22.960 --> 47:24.810
Well, not really.

47:27.400 --> 47:30.490
No, no need to look back.
He's following us.

47:32.360 --> 47:35.086
Keep on walking.
I'll be right along.

47:44.520 --> 47:46.519
Are you a guest here, sir?

47:46.520 --> 47:47.999
You're Robinson.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.531
Are you a guest of the hotel?

47:50.040 --> 47:51.119
Uh...

47:51.120 --> 47:52.639
Yes. Yes, I am.

47:52.640 --> 47:55.839
Then I must ask you to stop
annoying Miss McKenna any further.

47:55.840 --> 47:58.486
If you do not, I shall
see that you're put out.

48:08.480 --> 48:10.119
What did you say to him?

48:10.120 --> 48:12.322
What I've always said
to men of his sort.

48:27.640 --> 48:29.683
That gown of yours in Act 2,

48:30.320 --> 48:31.839
I'm not crazy about it, you know.

48:31.840 --> 48:33.963
It'll have to be redone.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.010
Warn Marie that I shall
discuss it with her later.

48:45.480 --> 48:48.239
MAN: Good evening, reservations
for four under Woods.

48:48.240 --> 48:52.159
Woods. Yes, <i>monsieur</i>. What
time was the reservation for?

48:52.160 --> 48:53.359
8:00 p.m.
8:00 p.m.

48:53.360 --> 48:54.919
<i>Monsieur,</i>
may I help you, please?

48:54.920 --> 48:57.441
I'm dining with Miss
McKenna, thank you.

49:03.480 --> 49:05.250
Good evening.
How are you, sir?

49:12.360 --> 49:15.039
I told you, we should have
gone to Poughpeepskie.

49:15.040 --> 49:16.319
Poughkeepsie.

49:16.320 --> 49:17.999
Poughpeepskie.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.487
And I just won't
discuss it any further.

49:41.360 --> 49:45.087
It isn't the lines at all.
If only these actors would...

49:46.600 --> 49:51.044
Isn't he the nincompoop who thought
he could do <i>Hamlet</i> last season?

49:52.120 --> 49:54.159
<i>Mon chéri,</i> we meet again.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.319
Yes, hello.

49:55.320 --> 49:59.439
I so admire a man not hidebound
by the dictates of fashion.

49:59.440 --> 50:01.079
Ma'am?
That suit.

50:01.080 --> 50:03.599
I haven't seen one
like it for a decade.

50:03.600 --> 50:04.719
(LAUGHING)

50:04.720 --> 50:06.365
A decade?
Yes.

50:06.840 --> 50:08.719
Still looking for Miss McKenna?

50:08.720 --> 50:10.968
Yes, in fact...
Over there.

50:18.040 --> 50:20.527
Thank you.

What do you think you're doing?

50:52.240 --> 50:54.090
Dancing with you.

50:54.280 --> 50:56.759
But we don't even know each other.

50:56.760 --> 50:58.039
I know everything about you.

50:58.040 --> 50:59.401
Yes, I'm sure you do.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.479
What do you mean?

51:01.480 --> 51:03.319
If you will excuse me...
No, you don't understand.

51:03.320 --> 51:05.879
I think I do.
No, no, please, don't leave.

51:05.880 --> 51:09.368
You have no idea how far
I've come to be with you.

51:31.040 --> 51:34.164
There's no need to be
afraid of me, you know.

51:40.560 --> 51:42.199
WILLIAM: The man's an intruder.

51:42.200 --> 51:46.325
Will you kindly see to it that he
is escorted from the premises?

51:47.200 --> 51:49.050
If you will, sir.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.565
One moment.

52:03.080 --> 52:05.089
I shall go with him.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.086
McKenna.

52:11.200 --> 52:13.448
Are you sure you want to do this?

52:14.920 --> 52:18.841
Don't worry, William.
I shall return momentarily.

52:33.840 --> 52:35.199
Thank you so much.
I was so embarrassed...

52:35.200 --> 52:36.839
Your name, please?

52:36.840 --> 52:38.399

52:40.920 --> 52:42.406
Your occupation?

52:42.600 --> 52:44.159
I'm a playwright.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.725
A playwright.

52:46.200 --> 52:48.159
(STAMMERING) Yes, but
I'm not here because...

52:48.160 --> 52:49.599
And you say that you know
everything about me.

52:49.600 --> 52:51.079
Well, yes...
Which is patently absurd.

52:51.080 --> 52:52.679
You couldn't possibly
know everything about me.

52:52.680 --> 52:56.043
We've never met. You're a
complete stranger to me.

52:57.360 --> 53:00.484
But then, why did you
say, "Is it you?"

53:02.440 --> 53:04.079
I don't have to answer that.

53:04.080 --> 53:07.124
I know you don't.
I wish you would, though.

53:14.280 --> 53:16.608
What is the matter with him?

53:17.880 --> 53:20.439
He's just looking out for me
as he has always done.

53:20.440 --> 53:23.166
But why is that?
Do I look dangerous?

53:25.880 --> 53:27.445
Wait. Wait.

54:14.120 --> 54:16.004
Seems appropriate.

54:17.240 --> 54:20.284
Rather handsome young man,
if ill-mannered.

54:20.960 --> 54:22.359
I'll keep an eye on him.

54:22.360 --> 54:24.244
I'm sure you will.

54:28.560 --> 54:30.649
Is he the one, William?

54:32.120 --> 54:33.481
Is he?

Good morning.

56:20.280 --> 56:21.641
You sleep all right?

56:21.840 --> 56:23.963
Wonderfully.
I'm sorry.

56:24.480 --> 56:26.091
I didn't sleep too well either.

56:26.600 --> 56:28.689
But I was on a porch chair.
So, you know...

56:29.000 --> 56:30.440
Don't you even have a room?

56:30.720 --> 56:33.685
Yes, I will at 9:18.
Room 416.

56:35.880 --> 56:39.163

like to go to breakfast?

56:39.720 --> 56:41.206

56:41.520 --> 56:43.165
Well, later?

I don't eat breakfast
on performance days.

No, of course not.

No, no, no.
It's not Mr. Collier.

Oh.

I'm sorry.

56:59.840 --> 57:02.999
Well, of course my
name is Mr. Collier.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.806
But I was hoping you'd call me
by my first name, Richard.

Why should I?
I don't know.

57:08.920 --> 57:10.690
Just hoped you would.

When can I see you today?

57:13.840 --> 57:15.239
I shall be rehearsing all day.

All day! That's crazy! You can't...

57:16.520 --> 57:18.404
Don't wake her up.

57:18.760 --> 57:20.680
Will you walk with me?
Can you do that much?

57:21.400 --> 57:22.601
I can't.

57:23.640 --> 57:25.959
Young woman, if you do not
walk with me, I shall go mad,

crazed things to myself.

(SHUSHING)

57:34.120 --> 57:37.210
Walk with me. Please.

and talk with you and get to know you

She's crazy about me.

58:28.680 --> 58:31.042
Can I persuade you to join me?

58:31.760 --> 58:34.008
Where are you from, Collier?

58:34.200 --> 58:36.767
Chicago.
Where are you from, sir?

58:37.440 --> 58:40.769
I'm given to understand
that you're a playwright.

58:40.880 --> 58:43.039
You understand correctly.

58:43.040 --> 58:47.643
No doubt you dream of seeing Miss
McKenna in one of your opera.

58:48.760 --> 58:51.439
That's plural for opus. I presume
you've written more than one?

58:51.440 --> 58:52.559
Mmm.

58:52.560 --> 58:53.799
And seen them produced.

58:53.800 --> 58:55.525
Really?
Mm-hmm.

58:56.200 --> 58:58.039
I'm not entirely unacquainted
with the achievements

58:58.040 --> 59:01.005
of the American stage
in the past decade.

59:01.680 --> 59:02.959
Perhaps I've seen one?

59:02.960 --> 59:04.650
No, I doubt it.

59:04.800 --> 59:08.490
I also doubt very much that I shall
ever see one graced by Miss McKenna.

59:10.080 --> 59:12.360
You don't really believe
that's why I'm here, do you?

59:15.200 --> 59:18.324
Why are you here?
Is it money?

59:19.640 --> 59:21.600
I don't think you really
believe that either.

59:21.920 --> 59:23.849
There is a law, Collier.

59:25.560 --> 59:27.599
I warn you. I will not
hesitate to make avail of it.

59:27.600 --> 59:29.006
Yes? On what charge?

59:30.400 --> 59:32.879
The matter's concluded, sir.
No.

59:32.880 --> 59:35.082
Yes.
You may depend on it.

59:40.560 --> 59:42.205
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.

59:42.560 --> 59:45.001
Excuse me. Arthur!

59:48.760 --> 59:50.246
Forgive me again, sir.

59:53.960 --> 59:55.479
I'm very sorry, sir.

59:55.480 --> 59:58.570
That's quite all right.
I'd like a room, please.

59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.883
Oh. Don't you have one?

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.564
Well, I was rather ill when I arrived
last night. So I stayed with a friend.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.171
Ah, I see.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.800
You do have a room, sir?

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.079
Yes, yes.

the register now, sir?

Excuse me. I'm sorry. Are you
sure this is the right room?

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.799
The right room, sir?
I don't understand.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.559
I'm sorry, Mr. Biehl.
That room is reserved.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.279
Forgot to put a notice in the slot.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.925
I'm very sorry.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.531
Right, shall I sign?
Would you, please?

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.361
Excuse me.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.924

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.039
Um...

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.561
It's no problem.
I can get it later myself.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.371
Thank you very much.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.240

Hello!

You look lovely.
Thank you.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.409
Shall we?
Certainly.

Sorry I'm late.
Complications.

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.362
What did you do to your face?
Shaved.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.120
New blade wasn't
quite sharp enough.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.839
I shudder to think what you'd look
like if the blade were any sharper.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.041
(CHUCKLES)

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.926
No. I don't believe it.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.489
Gotta give him credit.
He's like a bulldog.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.639
Would you like me to speak to him?

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.410
Wouldn't do a bit of good.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.483
I think I know what would, though.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.050
Whoa! Wait for me!
Whoa!

Mr. Collier, it isn't easy
being a successful actress.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.483
Over the years, I...

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.131
I found it necessary
to protect myself.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.481
So understand, please understand.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:44.048
That I'm even with you today

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.319
when we only met last night.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.171
Why did you say, is it you?

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.164
I was expecting.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.041
Me?

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.166
Someone.

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:03.686
Who?

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.166
Tell me.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.319
I think you'll laugh.

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.204
Why? Is it funny?

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:13.891
In a way.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.839
William told me you were coming.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:20.008
Robinson?
Yes.

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.570
He knows somehow.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.204
He really does.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.519
He knew a lot of things
before they happened,

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.165
my career, my...

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.605
He told me that

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.321
one day I would meet a man who'd

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.204
change my life.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:52.561
Did he tell you that man would
be someone to be afraid of?

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.126
Yes.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:59.489
And what do you think now?
Do you...

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.604
Do you believe that?

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:04.806
No.

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.203
You're obviously not.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.927
(HUMMING)

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.325
That's beautiful.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.280
What is it?

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.525
That's Rachmaninoff,
from the <i>Rhapsody.</i>

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.124
I saw him with
the philharmonic once.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.762
I love his music, but I've
never heard this piece.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:40.247
Really? Well, I'll introduce
you to it sometime.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.324
Sorry we had the carriage so long.
Thank you.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.759
See that guy's face?

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.599

for horse-napping.

Huh?

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.843
Stick out your tongue.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.207
Why? No.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:39.279
The most peculiar moment
in my life, Mr. Collier.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:42.086
I think you'll survive
it, Miss McKenna.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.884
What time is it now?

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.326
Um...

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.241
4:30.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.568
Well, I must be getting back.

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.199
You have to? Can't you
stay a little longer?

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.448
No, I have to rest awhile.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.406
The play.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.686
It's lovely.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.124
Where did you get it?

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.484
It was given to me.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.844
Well, shall we?

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.566
So, when's the company leave?

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.680
Tonight.

01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:39.328
Where are you going?

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:40.805
Denver.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.009
Well, thank you for
a most pleasant afternoon.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.925
Could we talk just a little longer?

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.366
I really should rest awhile.
Please.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.763
Very well, then.
Just for a moment or so.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.006
What did you want to talk about?

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.286
No.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.290
Oh, my God.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.646
Come in.

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.159
I think you'd better go.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.159
Have you been waiting all
this time for our return?

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.159
This is hardly the time for discussion...
Have you?

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:01.919
Yes.
Does that surprise you?

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.399
Our relationship is
strictly business.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:04.839
Strictly business?

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.519
I'm involved with you as an actress,
Mr. Robinson, not a doormat.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.281
Do not attempt to
wipe your boots on me.

Not good at all.

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.445
Particularly bad.

and several hundred pounds of him!

And never lets a soul forget it.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.526
I'm amazed he has
the least desire to marry.

The one I have created in my mind.

that I have nurtured her,

cared for her, molded, taught,
developed her for all these years

awareness of your age

act, she will continue to grow

you want her to be.

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:27.087
What could have happened to him?

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.966
Marie!

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:33.086
Marie, help me change.
Quickly.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.051
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.411
Wait, Marie.

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.651
Thank you, Marie.

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:02.050
Your performance in Act 1,

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:06.079
I must say, was somewhat eccentric.

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:08.479
Where is he?
What have you done to him?

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.125
I've done nothing, McKenna.

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:14.484
Mr. Collier has left.
That's all.

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:17.128
What do you mean?
Gone.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.486
From the hotel

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.006
and your life.

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.651
I don't believe you.

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:27.841
I must admit,

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.725
he was somewhat more charming

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.522
than others that we've
encountered in the past,

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.886
you and I.

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:39.319
A trifle more sincere,
perhaps. Still...

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.249
Then he was not
the one you spoke of?

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.399
No.

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.280
Then you were wrong
about him, weren't you?

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:49.485
You were wrong.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.646
I love him

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:57.042
and he's going to
make me very happy.

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:00.206
Do you understand?

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:05.965
I love him.

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:11.166
What difference can that
make now? He's gone.

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:13.928
I'll find him, William.

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:17.887
Don't you dare try to stop me.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:25.042
Now, if you will excuse
me while I change.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.800
Of course.

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.964
May I remind you

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.683
that we leave within the hour?

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:46.281
Thank you.

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.291
Are you all right?

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.571
The company, are they gone?
Company?

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:13.239
The ones who did the play last night.
Where are they? Are they gone?

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:15.249
They left as soon as
they were packed, sir.

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.720
Come along, Arthur.
We'll be late.

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.771
Richard!

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.439
You all right?
Yes.

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:10.449
I thought I lost you.
Never.

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.569
Never, never, never!

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.885
Mm-mm-mm!

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:06.726
You will marry me, won't you?

You won't?

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:13.921
Sure.

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.319
I was just laughing at the
way you asked, that's all.

01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.759
For one moment there...
What?

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:21.559
I thought you had a wife and
children back home somewhere.

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:22.761
(CHUCKLES)

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.287
Elise.

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.765
I want to be everything to you.

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.560
You are.

01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.445
You are.

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:36.119
Tell me more about
yourself, my love.

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:38.481
Well, I was born in...
What sort of plays do you write?

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:40.439
Are there parts in it for me?
I could...

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:43.239
I would love to act
in one of your plays,

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:46.639
assuming that I ever want
to act again after tonight.

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:48.171
You will.

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:49.646

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.486
Good plays.
What?

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.484
I write good plays.

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.599
I never let you answer, did I?

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.006
No.
Sorry.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.319
What time do you think it is?
I don't know.

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:15.126
I don't care. I love you.

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:18.209
Don't look. Fine.

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:23.319
It's 5:00.
Really?

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:24.639
I don't feel sleepy
somehow, do you?

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.046
No.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:33.520
The first thing I intend to do for you...
You've already done.

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:36.319
Well, the second thing, then.
What?

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.760
Buy you a new suit.

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:41.721
I don't understand.
Nobody seems to like my suit.

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:45.089
Well, can you blame them?
Wait a minute. I think my suit's terrific.

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:47.399
What's wrong with this?
So what if it's 10 years old?

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.639
At least 15.

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.251
Fifteen?
Mm-hmm.

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:53.245
Well, I think it's fabulous.
Let me show you.

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:56.121
It's a really great suit.
It's in first-class condition.

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.159
The sleeves fit.
That's pretty good for me.

01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.519
My arms are about nine feet long.

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:03.247
And it's got pockets everywhere.
I can pull rabbits outta here.

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:06.681
Yeah, this is the best part. This is
a special coin compartment for...
