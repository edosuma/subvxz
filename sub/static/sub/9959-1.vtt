01:52.360 --> 01:54.880
There's an old story.
The way the Apaches tell it...

01:55.080 --> 01:58.280
...a man was riding in the desert,
and he come across a vulture...

01:58.480 --> 02:01.160
...the kind they call turkey buzzards
in Arizona...

02:01.400 --> 02:03.360
...setting on a rock.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.199
"Hey," the man says, "how come you old
turkey buzzard setting here?"

02:08.360 --> 02:11.760
"I saw you flying over Hadleyburg,
and I didn't wanna meet up with you...

02:12.000 --> 02:14.280
...so I turned around and
I come this way."

02:14.520 --> 02:15.920
Old turkey buzzard says:

02:16.160 --> 02:19.760
"That's funny. I was only
passing through that town.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.760
I was really coming over here...

02:22.040 --> 02:23.840
...to wait for you."

02:43.640 --> 02:47.200
<i>Old turkey buzzard</i>

02:48.240 --> 02:52.480
<i>Old turkey buzzard</i>

02:52.760 --> 03:00.880
<i>Flying, flying high</i>

03:01.840 --> 03:05.320
<i>He's just awating</i>

03:06.640 --> 03:11.160
<i>Buzzard's just awating</i>

03:11.240 --> 03:15.920
<i>Waiting for something down below to die</i>

03:16.200 --> 03:19.880
<i>Old buzzard knows that he can wait</i>

03:20.280 --> 03:24.000
<i>Because every mother's son has got a date</i>

03:24.160 --> 03:29.320
<i>A date with fate, with fate</i>

03:29.440 --> 03:34.320
<i>He sees men come, he sees men go,</i>

03:34.400 --> 03:38.400
<i>Crawling like ants on the rocks below</i>

03:38.600 --> 03:42.920
<i>The men who steam, the men who dream</i>

03:43.040 --> 03:47.840
<i>And die for gold on the rocks below</i>

03:48.000 --> 03:50.960
<i>Gold, gold, gold</i>

03:51.040 --> 03:53.600
<i>They just got to have that gold...</i>

03:53.720 --> 03:55.200
<i>Gold, gold,...</i>

03:55.320 --> 04:01.760
<i>They'll do anything for gold...</i>

04:03.440 --> 04:05.920
<i>A thousand years ago in the Southwest...</i>

04:06.160 --> 04:08.320
<i>...there was an Apache legend.</i>

04:09.000 --> 04:12.680
<i>It told about a hidden canyon,
guarded by the Apache gods...</i>

04:12.920 --> 04:14.960
<i>...and rich with gold.</i>

04:17.560 --> 04:20.240
<i>As long as the Apaches kept
the canyon a secret...</i>

04:20.480 --> 04:25.160
<i>...and never touched the gold,
they would be strong, powerful.</i>

04:27.000 --> 04:28.720
<i>That was the legend.</i>

04:30.280 --> 04:33.760
<i>When the Spanish conquistadores came,
they searched for that canyon.</i>

04:34.000 --> 04:36.840
<i>They called it "Caсуn del Oro"...</i>

04:37.040 --> 04:39.200
<i>...meaning "Canyon of Gold."</i>

04:39.560 --> 04:41.320
<i>But they never found it.</i>

04:44.800 --> 04:47.960
<i>Three hundred years later,
the Americans came.</i>

04:48.400 --> 04:51.720
<i>They heard about the legend,
but they called the canyon...</i>

04:51.960 --> 04:53.440
<i>..."The Lost Adams."</i>

04:55.080 --> 04:58.360
<i>That was because a man
named Adams saw it once.</i>

04:58.600 --> 04:59.760
<i>Or so he said.</i>

05:00.280 --> 05:04.520
<i>But whether he did or not,
he never saw anything again...</i>

05:04.720 --> 05:08.560
<i>...because the Apaches
burned out his eyes.</i>

05:10.280 --> 05:14.760
<i>Everybody knew about that legend,
and a lot of people believed it.</i>

05:16.360 --> 05:18.160
<i>"Caсуn del Oro."</i>

05:19.160 --> 05:21.000
<i>"The Lost Adams."</i>

05:23.080 --> 05:27.760
<i>And then for a while there
back in 1874, they called it...</i>

05:28.600 --> 05:30.640
<i>..."Mackenna's Gold."</i>

05:33.040 --> 05:35.440
<i>Old turkey buzzard</i>

05:37.480 --> 05:40.720
<i>Old turkey buzzard</i>

05:42.000 --> 05:49.240
<i>Flying, flying high</i>

05:51.280 --> 05:53.240
<i>He's just awaiting</i>

05:55.640 --> 05:59.680
<i>Buzzard's just awaiting</i>

06:00.240 --> 06:04.400
<i>Waiting for something down below to die</i>

06:05.240 --> 06:09.120
<i>Old buzzard knows that he can wait</i>

06:09.320 --> 06:13.120
<i>Because every mother's son has got a date</i>

06:13.480 --> 06:18.080
<i>A date with fate, with fate</i>

06:18.640 --> 06:22.920
<i>He sees men come, he sees men go</i>

06:23.240 --> 06:27.480
<i>Crawling like ants on the rocks below</i>

06:27.720 --> 06:32.080
<i>A whiff of gold and off they go</i>

06:32.320 --> 06:37.000
<i>To die like rats
On the rocks below</i>

06:37.200 --> 06:39.840
<i>Gold, gold, gold</i>

06:40.040 --> 06:43.000
<i>They'll do anything for gold...</i>

06:43.120 --> 06:44.560
<i>Gold, gold...</i>

06:44.720 --> 06:49.480
<i>Got to have Mackenna's Gold...</i>

10:37.200 --> 10:39.000
Take it easy, old man.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.280
You're not healthy enough
to play games.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.480
I know you.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.240
You are Mackenna...

10:46.760 --> 10:47.840
...the Marshal.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.560
That's right,
but I don't know you.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.120
Why'd you try to bushwhack me?

10:55.280 --> 10:56.560
Somebody pay you?

10:57.480 --> 10:58.880
- Colorado?
- No pay.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.600
- Nobody pay.
- Then why?

11:02.520 --> 11:05.280
Because you look for gold.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.440
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
An old man like you...

11:11.280 --> 11:13.560
...going around shooting at prospectors.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.640
Keep that up
and you'll get in trouble.

11:16.880 --> 11:20.960
Besides, if you know me, you know
I quit gold hunting a long time ago.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.680
The only dust I found
was prairie dust.

11:23.880 --> 11:26.280
Never got rich, but I sure got thirsty.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.480
Now you look for the gold again.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.680
Everybody look for the gold.

11:31.880 --> 11:32.560
What gold?

11:38.200 --> 11:39.880
What gold?

11:53.280 --> 11:54.920
I know this place.

11:55.360 --> 11:58.320
That's Shaking Rock.
No gold around there.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.120
I've been there.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.200
Why you stay with me?

12:16.080 --> 12:17.640
Why you not kill me?

12:17.880 --> 12:19.760
That's what I ought to do.

12:22.840 --> 12:26.160
Give me your word you won't go
picking off people anymore...

12:26.400 --> 12:27.840
...and I'll take you home.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.640
No home.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.720
I'll get you to a doctor.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.640
I die here.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.520
Now you have the gold.

12:48.360 --> 12:51.920
But you will wish
you never see this map.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.720
The spirits will kill you.
No laugh!

12:56.600 --> 12:59.280
It is a secret place.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.920
So that's what it's supposed to be.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.000
The <i>Caсуn del Oro.</i>
The Lost Adams.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.600
Don't worry.
I won't go looking for it.

13:08.040 --> 13:11.720
Wasted 3 years chasing that wild goose.
There is no Lost Adams.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.920
It is bad time.

13:15.440 --> 13:20.080
Young warriors want gold,
like white men.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.520
It is good time...

13:22.760 --> 13:25.760
...for old man to die.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.160
Plenty of time for that.
Don't rush it.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.360
Feel like eating something?

13:48.360 --> 13:49.920
Old man?

13:53.160 --> 13:54.400
Old man.

14:03.880 --> 14:06.200
Damn!
I wish you hadn't shot at me.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.880
I thought maybe
you were someone else.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.240
Soldiers.
Many soldiers.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.480
Sir, you have been most kind.
We are grateful.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.680
We ask no more
of your hospitality...

15:43.880 --> 15:47.280
...than the loan of a few horses
and mules, which we need...

15:47.520 --> 15:49.000
...and food for our journey.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.560
Also, we will take your wife.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.640
Because if we run into trouble
with the cavalry, she may be useful.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.120
If we pass this way again,
God willing...

15:59.360 --> 16:01.280
...I will sell her back to you.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.040
That is a true promise.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.600
Take a rest, Marshal.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.720
We will finish the old man's grave.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.040
We'll make it a little longer...

17:09.280 --> 17:10.880
...a little wider...

17:11.400 --> 17:13.640
...and maybe
we'll bury you together.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.119
God is good to me.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.319
You remember?

17:20.520 --> 17:23.839
I told you I would come for you,
old friend.

17:25.079 --> 17:27.200
You'll never get back, old friend.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.760
I will find the way.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.440
Put that shovel down
and come talk to Colorado.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.520
Don't move, Mackenna...

17:56.720 --> 17:58.120
...or I'll cut you in half.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.200
Come out like a gentleman.

18:20.600 --> 18:24.160
You know, we've been trailing
that old man for two weeks now.

18:24.360 --> 18:25.680
- Where's the map?
- Map?

18:26.040 --> 18:26.800
What map?

19:02.280 --> 19:04.360
I know this fellow.
He's a good card player.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.560
He always remembers the cards.

19:07.120 --> 19:09.560
If he saw the map, he remembers it.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.840
So we have a map,
in his head.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.440
I told you!

19:15.680 --> 19:18.520
I told you nobody runs me out.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.640
Now I have you,
and you will take us to the gold.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.640
And then I will kill you.

19:45.760 --> 19:49.000
Hurry up, Besh! Cover him
with some rocks and let's go.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.560
He is a chief.
He was going to <i>Caсуn del Oro.</i>

19:56.240 --> 19:58.000
We bury him there.

20:01.400 --> 20:05.360
You crazy? He's going to stink
by the time we get there.

20:35.680 --> 20:38.920
Of course. He's a chief!
He must be buried there.

20:39.640 --> 20:42.160
I should have thought of it myself.

21:40.320 --> 21:41.640
Besh!
Come on!

22:34.720 --> 22:35.520
Look out!

23:18.520 --> 23:22.440
<i>In the old days, before Mackenna
ran him out of the territory...</i>

23:22.680 --> 23:25.720
<i>...Colorado had a hideout
in a little box canyon.</i>

23:26.120 --> 23:28.720
<i>Now that he was back,
he was using it again.</i>

23:29.320 --> 23:32.480
<i>And that's where he took Mackenna,
his living map.</i>

24:18.200 --> 24:19.360
You're crazy to come back.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.960
You know Judge Bergerman
put a price on your head.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.160
You know, that's funny.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.560
I never lay eyes
on Judge Bergerman.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.520
But he don't like me.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.080
Someday me and him will meet.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.880
And I will take
his head in a basket.

24:35.920 --> 24:36.800
Anyway...

24:37.400 --> 24:39.880
...I came back after
that map you burned up.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.040
Why?

24:41.440 --> 24:44.760
You can buy a dozen just like it
for a dollar apiece.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.920
Not like that map.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.360
Not like the map
old Prairie Dog was carrying.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.800
But that old man
wasn't Prairie Dog.

24:55.560 --> 24:56.520
Prairie Dog is dead.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.000
He sure is now.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.160
The whole thing is a fairy tale.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.040
There's no <i>Caсуn del Oro.</i>

25:05.320 --> 25:06.760
Old Adams was never there.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.120
Why did you kill Prairie Dog
and take his map?

25:09.360 --> 25:10.560
That's not how it happened.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.400
I know how it happened.

25:12.960 --> 25:15.720
You just got tired of working
for 20 bucks a month.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.800
So you took advantage
of that poor old man.

25:18.160 --> 25:20.480
You bushwhacked him,
gunned him down and took his map.

25:20.680 --> 25:22.920
I'm surprised at you,
a Marshal!

25:41.840 --> 25:42.960
Hesh-Ke remembers you.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.720
I remember her too.

25:48.720 --> 25:51.160
I can't figure out
how you knew about this map.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.960
This is the only real one.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.600
It was supposed to be only
in Prairie Dog's head.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.920
He was supposed to
pass it on before he died.

25:59.880 --> 26:02.080
Somebody found out
there really was a map.

26:03.080 --> 26:05.640
Two weeks ago, the old man
up and left the tribe.

26:06.280 --> 26:07.840
Why didn't he pass it on?

26:09.600 --> 26:12.240
I guess he didn't know
who he could trust.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.120
See, the Apache have changed.

26:15.760 --> 26:17.960
They're beginning to think
like white men now.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.720
The young ones figure they got
more use for that gold...

26:20.960 --> 26:23.680
- ... than those old spirits have.
- There isn't any gold.

26:24.200 --> 26:26.640
If there was, it would belong
to the whole tribe.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.200
You're wrong.

26:31.200 --> 26:35.480
That gold belongs to the spirits,
and they said I can have it.

26:39.280 --> 26:41.440
Listen, old friend.
I know you.

26:41.760 --> 26:44.120
You're just like an Apache.
Very stubborn.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.360
These other friends of mine,
they're stubborn too.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.560
Why don't you just take us there?
We'll be partners.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.360
- There's enough for all of us.
- I've been there.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.280
There's not enough gold there
to fill your back tooth.

26:59.760 --> 27:00.960
You've been in the canyon?

27:01.480 --> 27:02.600
There's no canyon.

27:03.560 --> 27:04.640
You don't know.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.480
Listen, you like to gamble.
Let's take a chance.

27:08.680 --> 27:09.760
Suppose we lose?

27:10.480 --> 27:13.280
Well, then we split up and
you go wherever you want.

27:14.360 --> 27:17.920
How? On foot, with my hands
tied behind my back?

27:19.240 --> 27:23.000
I'll give you anything you need.
Water, horses, your guns.

27:23.240 --> 27:24.240
When?

27:24.680 --> 27:26.600
- When what?
- The guns.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.680
When you take us there.
You got to prove yourself.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.000
I tell you what else
I will give you.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.760
I will give you the girl.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.560
What girl?

27:43.040 --> 27:44.840
The one you've been looking at.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.640
I tell you the truth.
Her husband's rich.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.920
You will get a big reward.

27:51.400 --> 27:52.640
Monkey.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.400
Monkey, what do we want?

27:54.640 --> 27:56.320
We want the gold.
Why?

27:56.560 --> 28:00.440
Because when we get the gold,
we can buy all the women we want.

28:00.680 --> 28:03.400
Besides, if Laguna don't
show up tomorrow...

28:03.640 --> 28:05.720
...it's an extra share
for all of us.

28:08.160 --> 28:09.120
You want Scarface?

28:10.160 --> 28:10.920
Take her.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.600
Take the little fat one.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.760
Take the old woman.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.160
You're going to
have lots of fun.

28:24.920 --> 28:27.040
What do you say?
We shake on it?

28:28.760 --> 28:29.840
All right.

28:31.640 --> 28:33.240
I'll take you there.

28:33.480 --> 28:35.880
And the gold is all yours.

28:36.440 --> 28:39.520
I'll take you there, and then I go.
Like you said.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.120
No gold?

28:43.080 --> 28:43.840
Why?

28:44.040 --> 28:45.760
You like Hadleyberg so much?

28:46.320 --> 28:48.160
They don't like you.
That's what I hear.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.840
I'll tell you the truth.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.560
I'm superstitious.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.720
I don't want to tangle
with those Indian spirits.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.640
Okay.
You're crazy, but okay.

28:57.880 --> 29:00.480
Another thing, you tell
your little boy there...

29:00.720 --> 29:02.600
...I want all my stuff back.

29:02.840 --> 29:06.000
Sure. I keep everything safe
for you until you go.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.800
But there's no gold
and there's no canyon.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
I make the jokes, <i>compadre!</i>

30:02.960 --> 30:05.200
You're lucky. Looks like
she ain't holding no grudge.

30:05.600 --> 30:08.680
Oh, she was mad.
I think she still likes you.

30:09.160 --> 30:10.960
Too bad I already
gave her to Monkey.

30:12.120 --> 30:13.360
You want to change your mind?

30:53.880 --> 30:55.120
Sleep well, old friend.

31:22.280 --> 31:23.360
Miss?

31:26.160 --> 31:28.400
You know me.
I'm Mackenna.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.200
The Marshal.

31:38.600 --> 31:40.440
I'm not going to hurt you.

31:42.560 --> 31:43.840
You know me.

31:45.240 --> 31:47.600
It was your father
who made me Marshal.

31:55.960 --> 31:57.920
They killed my father.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.480
They killed my father...

32:04.680 --> 32:06.560
Don't tell any of them...
nobody...

32:06.760 --> 32:09.120
...that you're Judge Bergerman's
daughter.

32:10.480 --> 32:14.240
If Colorado finds out, you'll be
in worse trouble than you are now.

32:15.560 --> 32:16.800
You understand?

32:36.120 --> 32:37.280
You hear me?

32:51.000 --> 32:52.880
Yes, I remember you.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.880
You came to the ranch once
for supper.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.800
That's right.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.320
I was once.

32:59.160 --> 33:01.080
They say you like to play cards.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.480
Well, yes.

33:04.920 --> 33:08.600
I enjoy an unfriendly game
of poker from time to time.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.760
Off duty, of course.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.920
I take a drink now and then too.

33:16.040 --> 33:18.800
My father didn't hold
with gambling, and neither do I.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.160
Well, I know, miss.
I know that.

33:22.440 --> 33:25.320
I'm trying to mend my ways.
Seriously.

33:26.720 --> 33:29.360
Doesn't look right for a Marshal
to be playing cards.

33:31.120 --> 33:31.880
Now you rest.

33:35.360 --> 33:36.800
Try to sleep.

33:37.400 --> 33:38.880
And remember what I told you.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.920
We start early tomorrow.
Go get some sleep.

35:08.680 --> 35:09.760
You see?

35:09.960 --> 35:13.160
I keep my end of the deal, old friend.
You keep yours.

35:15.080 --> 35:18.160
Better put your belt on.
You could lose your pants.

35:34.680 --> 35:35.440
Okay, come on.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.440
Hey, we no wait for Laguna?

35:38.800 --> 35:42.840
He likes that girl in Hadleyberg
so much, let him get rich with her.

35:46.480 --> 35:48.080
Man comes with flag.

36:30.360 --> 36:32.400
Take the girl inside.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.680
I don't think they're
looking for you, Marshal.

36:42.920 --> 36:45.480
But if they are,
I would like to kill you.

36:49.160 --> 36:52.320
I don't know how I'd get you
to that canyon if you did.

36:54.120 --> 36:58.240
You could with a broken kneecap.
Painful, but possible.

36:58.720 --> 37:02.640
And if you want to collect the reward on
that girl, remember Hesh-Ke has a knife.

37:04.800 --> 37:05.600
Colorado?

37:07.280 --> 37:08.560
John Colorado?

37:09.960 --> 37:10.880
Ben!

37:12.680 --> 37:14.440
Ben Baker!

37:14.680 --> 37:16.000
- My old friend!
- Don't!

37:16.200 --> 37:18.280
Stay where you are,
Colorado.

37:20.120 --> 37:21.440
Who's that with you?

37:26.320 --> 37:28.320
You and Colorado together.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.120
Well, well, well.

37:30.360 --> 37:31.720
Surprised?

37:32.040 --> 37:34.120
Some people with me might be,
but not me.

37:34.360 --> 37:35.920
Not with a stake like this one.

37:37.480 --> 37:40.480
No, this is no time
for holding old grudges.

37:40.720 --> 37:43.480
Speaking for myself,
I'm glad you're here.

37:43.720 --> 37:44.800
We can play some poker.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.240
Not with your cards.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.760
Welcome back, Colorado.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.440
And there's enough for all of us.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.080
Enough?

37:55.760 --> 37:57.560
We know all about it.

37:57.800 --> 38:00.640
We know you've been
looking for Prairie Dog.

38:00.840 --> 38:03.840
We know you got the word
from Besh and Little Hatchet.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.040
How'd you know
we were here?

38:08.600 --> 38:10.600
Nobody but us
knows about this place.

38:17.480 --> 38:18.240
Laguna.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.320
I'm sorry, Colorado.

38:22.120 --> 38:23.360
You know me.

38:24.000 --> 38:24.880
I drink too much...

38:25.400 --> 38:26.720
...and I talk too much.

38:27.840 --> 38:28.960
They had me.

38:29.880 --> 38:30.760
You see?

38:31.240 --> 38:33.960
Didn't I say Laguna
shouldn't go into Hadleyberg?

38:35.920 --> 38:37.720
It's a big desert.

38:37.960 --> 38:40.200
It'll take a lot of eyes
to find that old man.

38:41.160 --> 38:44.640
And after that, it's going to be
a long way to the canyon.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.240
There's cavalry out after you...

38:46.520 --> 38:47.720
...more than you've ever seen.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.560
And a lot of bronco Apaches
on the prowl...

38:50.840 --> 38:52.360
...after anybody and everybody.

38:52.680 --> 38:54.240
Probably after the gold too.

38:55.880 --> 38:58.600
You don't know what's
going on out there.

39:00.960 --> 39:01.920
You need us.

39:05.320 --> 39:06.720
One more thing.

39:07.240 --> 39:10.880
You got yourself a mighty fine place
here, but it's a box canyon.

39:11.720 --> 39:14.120
One way in,
same way out.

39:15.720 --> 39:18.280
We could camp outside
till you get awful hungry.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.720
Well, there's a lot
in what you say.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.960
Of course, if the soldiers
catch us together...

39:27.200 --> 39:28.600
...you will hang together with me.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.280
If Mackenna will take
a chance with you...

39:35.560 --> 39:36.720
...that's good enough for me.

39:37.920 --> 39:38.960
What do you think?

39:43.880 --> 39:44.960
I'm glad he's here.

39:45.840 --> 39:46.800
Like he says...

39:47.880 --> 39:49.600
...we can play some poker
along the way.

39:58.680 --> 40:01.080
With respect,
move the chief.

40:05.240 --> 40:07.920
It is true that there's
enough for all of us.

40:08.160 --> 40:11.960
But it is also true that it's
a long way to the canyon.

40:16.040 --> 40:16.800
It's a deal!

40:17.400 --> 40:18.920
Come have some breakfast.

40:25.440 --> 40:26.560
Hold it!

40:27.720 --> 40:29.360
He double-crossed me.

40:30.080 --> 40:32.720
You all knew I'd kill him
the first chance I got.

40:34.680 --> 40:38.920
Anyway, there's enough for all of us.
Only now, there'll be a little more.

40:52.040 --> 40:53.360
Only, no more killing...

40:53.600 --> 40:55.640
...or there sure will be a lot of it.

41:26.560 --> 41:27.840
You know, Ben...

41:29.480 --> 41:31.360
...we've got a deal...

41:32.040 --> 41:36.000
...but I wish I could've seen
all your friends before we made it.

41:36.240 --> 41:37.640
What's wrong with them?

41:39.840 --> 41:40.880
These two...

41:41.120 --> 41:44.360
...I don't know what they are,
and I'm afraid to guess.

41:47.840 --> 41:51.040
We were just passing
through Hadleyberg...

41:51.680 --> 41:55.960
...and I'm afraid we overheard
a most interesting conversation.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.560
Baker was kind enough
to let us join the group.

41:59.360 --> 42:01.160
It promises to be good sport.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.160
And profitable too.

42:04.880 --> 42:05.920
Is that so?

42:09.120 --> 42:09.920
That so?

42:13.640 --> 42:14.720
Good sports.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.480
I know this fellow.

42:20.040 --> 42:22.400
You're the storekeeper
from Hadleyberg.

42:23.960 --> 42:26.160
Does your wife know where you are?

42:29.120 --> 42:32.040
I don't know this one,
but he looks pale too.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.840
What are you?
A dentist?

42:35.440 --> 42:38.560
He's the editor of
the <i>Hadleyberg Gazette.</i>

42:42.120 --> 42:44.040
This one looks like a preacher.

42:44.240 --> 42:45.240
I preach.

42:45.600 --> 42:47.400
What do you preach? Gold?

42:47.640 --> 42:49.080
The word of God.

42:49.320 --> 42:50.600
But you like gold, huh?

42:51.160 --> 42:54.040
It can work for the Lord
as well as the devil.

42:54.280 --> 42:57.200
Why should only the Church of Rome
have gold?

42:57.880 --> 43:01.320
Gold, silver,
idols and corruption!

43:01.800 --> 43:02.920
When I get my gold...

43:03.160 --> 43:03.920
Your gold?

43:04.160 --> 43:05.520
My share.

43:06.640 --> 43:09.280
My share will build
a tabernacle to the Lord.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.680
A temple of the true Gospel.

43:12.200 --> 43:15.520
Maybe a whole string of them
through the territory.

43:15.720 --> 43:18.640
To bring this fellow,
you got to be crazier than he is.

43:18.920 --> 43:20.800
I told you, everybody knows.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.440
You can't keep gold a secret.
It travels in the air.

43:24.640 --> 43:26.520
Anyway, we can use
every gun we can get.

43:27.040 --> 43:28.200
No matter who carries it.

43:30.920 --> 43:33.480
This won't be like
a walk to church on Sunday.

43:34.480 --> 43:37.800
Might get yourself killed.
Might have to do some killing yourself.

43:38.400 --> 43:41.040
The Lord knows what He wants
His servants to do.

43:44.440 --> 43:46.320
Anyway, that gold belongs
to the Apache.

43:47.040 --> 43:49.760
It can be used for them,
to bring them to the Lord.

43:50.280 --> 43:53.560
Chihuahua!
He makes a good deal with his Lord.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.880
Now we come to
the last and the best...

43:59.120 --> 44:00.960
...a blind man and a kid.

44:01.200 --> 44:03.240
I see good enough for both of us.

44:03.480 --> 44:06.240
That old man has a better right
to be here than we have.

44:06.920 --> 44:08.000
Don't you know him?

44:08.920 --> 44:10.880
That's Adams himself.

44:15.840 --> 44:16.760
That's Adams!

44:19.480 --> 44:20.400
You see?

44:22.240 --> 44:23.200
You see?

44:23.440 --> 44:24.680
That's Adams.

44:25.160 --> 44:25.960
I see Adams.

44:26.200 --> 44:27.520
I don't see any gold.

44:28.960 --> 44:30.560
There's gold there.

44:31.720 --> 44:33.720
More gold than you ever saw.

44:33.960 --> 44:35.440
All the gold in the world.

44:35.920 --> 44:36.920
Tell him.

44:37.240 --> 44:38.520
Tell him the story.

44:39.560 --> 44:41.600
No, it's been told too many times.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.240
But we're going to take you back there.
Go on, Mr. Adams.

44:45.560 --> 44:46.400
Tell us.

44:54.880 --> 44:57.320
It was the Mexican
that took us there.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.680
The one that was brought up
by the Apaches.

45:03.080 --> 45:05.440
He didn't want no gold for himself.

45:06.560 --> 45:07.480
He was afraid.

45:09.040 --> 45:12.080
Kept talking about
the old Apache spirits.

45:13.280 --> 45:15.920
All he wanted was
a string of horses.

45:17.120 --> 45:18.400
So we gave it to him.

45:21.280 --> 45:23.240
And the way he took us there...

45:24.360 --> 45:27.960
...twisting and turning
and mostly by night...

45:28.200 --> 45:30.080
...we never knew where we were.

45:31.120 --> 45:34.960
And at the last, he made us
put on blindfolds.

45:38.120 --> 45:39.560
When we took them off...

45:41.800 --> 45:43.240
...there it was.

45:44.880 --> 45:47.080
The prettiest little valley
you ever saw.

45:49.960 --> 45:52.440
Sparkling and shining in the sun.

45:52.680 --> 45:54.240
It was just like a dream.

45:56.200 --> 46:00.040
Indians used to live there
1,000 years ago, maybe even more.

46:01.040 --> 46:02.160
Gold...

46:03.240 --> 46:04.480
...everywhere.

46:05.160 --> 46:07.920
The canyon wall had streaks...

46:09.000 --> 46:11.280
...five yards, ten yards wide.

46:12.520 --> 46:15.600
On the canyon floor, there were
nuggets all over the ground.

46:15.840 --> 46:17.080
Pure gold!

46:20.280 --> 46:22.920
Gold dust in every clump of brush.

46:25.160 --> 46:29.400
You couldn't put a pan
in the river without showing color.

46:31.280 --> 46:34.080
The first day, we filled
a great big coffeepot...

46:34.760 --> 46:36.200
...with just nuggets.

46:36.600 --> 46:37.800
No one could lift it.

46:38.600 --> 46:41.200
We built a shack.

46:41.960 --> 46:43.200
Went to work.

46:45.720 --> 46:46.920
Next thing...

46:48.400 --> 46:50.120
...the Apaches were there.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.760
They killed everyone except me.

46:55.720 --> 46:57.520
Then they fixed my eyes...

46:59.320 --> 47:01.120
...and left me in the desert.

47:03.640 --> 47:07.360
I wasn't any older
than this lad here.

47:10.240 --> 47:12.000
Tell them about the nugget.

47:16.680 --> 47:18.560
When I got found...

47:18.760 --> 47:21.560
...I still had one little nugget
in my pocket.

47:21.800 --> 47:23.200
Just a little one.

47:24.360 --> 47:26.560
$190, it was worth.

47:28.200 --> 47:29.720
Just a little one.

48:10.520 --> 48:11.440
You know something?

48:11.680 --> 48:12.800
You're pretty!

48:14.720 --> 48:17.680
I don't know if you are
a boy or a girl.

48:19.720 --> 48:20.840
If you are a boy...

48:21.800 --> 48:24.000
...I'm going to give you a haircut.

48:24.240 --> 48:27.400
And if you are a girl,
I am going to kiss you.

48:29.800 --> 48:31.560
I think you are a girl.

48:48.920 --> 48:49.880
That's Hachita.

48:58.400 --> 48:59.160
Soldiers!

49:29.960 --> 49:32.440
Who's going to do it,
your men or mine?

49:33.120 --> 49:35.000
Yours.
You have more to spare.

49:35.880 --> 49:37.160
We'll cut for it.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.640
Okay.
But I shuffle.

50:00.400 --> 50:04.880
When we move out, you gentlemen
head straight for the cavalry.

50:05.120 --> 50:06.560
Tell them about Colorado.

50:06.800 --> 50:08.640
- Tell them I'm his prisoner.
- What?

50:09.080 --> 50:11.200
I don't understand.
How could you be his prisoner?

50:11.520 --> 50:13.360
You trying to get rid of us?

50:14.160 --> 50:15.600
I'm trying to save your lives.

50:15.840 --> 50:18.440
Forget about the gold, Mr. Weaver.
There isn't any.

50:18.680 --> 50:21.280
- Get back to your store.
- I don't believe you.

50:21.520 --> 50:22.720
You know better than that.

50:22.920 --> 50:24.560
A man like you
has no business here.

50:24.840 --> 50:27.160
That gold will do a lot
for the whole territory.

50:27.400 --> 50:29.400
Forget about it.
Do what I tell you.

50:35.560 --> 50:36.880
These men have gold fever.

50:37.120 --> 50:39.560
Get out of this.
Get to the cavalry.

50:51.560 --> 50:53.200
What is he telling you?

50:53.440 --> 50:55.200
The truth.
I told them to go home.

50:57.640 --> 51:01.440
Why are you so selfish?
You can't keep it all for yourself.

51:02.360 --> 51:05.200
Did he tell you
that he killed Prairie Dog?

51:05.800 --> 51:09.640
He burned the map, but he knows where
the canyon is. That's the truth.

51:09.880 --> 51:11.560
Now that's more like it.

51:12.040 --> 51:14.040
I never trusted you, Mackenna.

51:14.880 --> 51:18.520
It was a mistake to let the judge
talk us into making you a Marshal.

51:18.760 --> 51:22.400
A man from nowhere. A drifter.
You never were one of us.

51:22.640 --> 51:24.120
I cleaned up your town.

51:24.360 --> 51:25.600
Where's your badge now?

51:26.840 --> 51:29.240
- Did you really kill that old man?
- Sure.

51:30.120 --> 51:31.920
But it was self-defense.

51:32.560 --> 51:33.800
You're a murderer!

51:36.600 --> 51:40.480
It's been a nice, quick trial.
When's the hanging?

51:41.320 --> 51:42.880
What's all this talk of hanging?

51:43.080 --> 51:45.640
We're all friends here.
All partners.

51:49.840 --> 51:52.200
Inga!
What are you doing here?

51:53.320 --> 51:54.520
Why is she here?

51:57.280 --> 51:58.520
I will tell you.

51:58.760 --> 52:00.960
I will tell you the whole truth.

52:01.200 --> 52:04.680
On our way to meet Mackenna,
when he sent for us...

52:04.920 --> 52:08.640
...we ran out of food,
so we stopped at a little ranch.

52:08.880 --> 52:12.240
We expected to pay, but the man...

52:13.480 --> 52:14.640
...he starts to shoot.

52:15.480 --> 52:16.240
So we beg.

52:16.480 --> 52:17.480
"Please, stop!"

52:18.400 --> 52:20.160
He's crazy.
He won't listen.

52:25.720 --> 52:27.760
So we thought
the best thing to do...

52:28.000 --> 52:30.440
...make her a partner,
give her a full share.

52:32.040 --> 52:33.120
Your father's dead?

52:35.400 --> 52:37.840
But what can we do now?
Nothing.

52:38.560 --> 52:41.000
As long as we live,
we'll never get this chance again.

52:41.240 --> 52:42.680
You mean it was an accident?

52:42.920 --> 52:44.320
I swear it.

52:44.600 --> 52:46.560
I, myself, said a prayer
over his grave.

52:46.800 --> 52:49.720
We can't bring him back now,
that's for sure.

52:50.320 --> 52:51.520
Right, Fuller?

52:55.240 --> 52:56.480
No, we can't.

52:57.320 --> 52:58.720
Right, storekeeper?

52:59.480 --> 53:00.480
I don't know.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.880
I don't know what to think.

53:03.280 --> 53:04.560
This isn't what I expected.

53:05.240 --> 53:06.800
I didn't think it'd be like this.

53:08.040 --> 53:09.200
I don't know what to do.

53:09.440 --> 53:10.560
You can get out of this...

53:10.760 --> 53:13.200
...all of you,
before it's too late.

53:15.480 --> 53:16.600
Gentlemen, forgive me.

53:16.840 --> 53:21.440
I'm a stranger here, so I haven't
followed a good deal of this.

53:21.640 --> 53:26.120
But I do feel it would be a terrible
pity if we fell out among ourselves.

53:26.680 --> 53:29.600
Or if we abandoned what
we all set out to accomplish.

53:31.720 --> 53:33.640
We're embarked on
a great adventure.

53:33.880 --> 53:36.880
Something that comes
only once in a lifetime.

53:37.120 --> 53:40.440
So I propose that we
forget the past...

53:40.680 --> 53:43.960
...whatever may have occurred,
and all go forward.

53:44.200 --> 53:46.560
He's right, he's right,
he's right!

53:47.400 --> 53:51.120
Why else do you think the good God
brings us all together like this?

53:51.360 --> 53:52.880
It's true, <i>Padrecito</i> ?

53:53.320 --> 53:55.160
I have nothing to say to you.

53:56.680 --> 53:58.920
The Lord has His own ways...

53:59.160 --> 54:01.720
...and I have my own reasons
for being here.

54:02.880 --> 54:03.840
So we agree.

54:04.080 --> 54:05.800
Mackenna takes us to the canyon.

54:06.040 --> 54:07.440
Sure, we agree.

54:08.360 --> 54:10.080
We all agree to get rich.

54:11.080 --> 54:12.840
You're all going to be
millionaires.

54:13.400 --> 54:14.680
Every one of you.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.920
That's what you think,
and nothing else matters.

54:19.480 --> 54:21.360
Best man your town had
was murdered.

54:21.600 --> 54:23.680
All you can say is,
"We can't bring him back."

54:24.200 --> 54:28.160
Not much of an epitaph, is it?
It's all you've got time for.

54:28.760 --> 54:30.360
You can't see,
you can't hear...

54:30.600 --> 54:33.680
...you don't want to know
anything but that gold.

54:33.920 --> 54:35.240
You're sick with it,
all of you.

54:35.480 --> 54:38.600
I started out being his prisoner.
Now you're all on my back.

54:39.640 --> 54:42.000
There's no gold, no canyon.
There's nothing.

54:42.240 --> 54:45.920
It's just a story this old man tells
to get himself free drinks.

54:49.040 --> 54:51.440
I'll take you there.
I got no choice.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.240
But I'll tell you this:

54:54.520 --> 54:56.800
Not many of you
will be coming back.

54:58.600 --> 54:59.600
There is gold.

55:00.400 --> 55:02.480
I saw it.
All the gold in the world.

55:15.080 --> 55:17.520
Come on, come on.
We're wasting time.

55:19.880 --> 55:20.800
You know...

55:21.520 --> 55:23.240
...I'm beginning not to trust you.

55:24.280 --> 55:25.240
I trust you.

55:33.320 --> 55:35.160
Oh, my God.
After all these years...

55:35.360 --> 55:38.160
...don't you know you mount a horse
on the left side?

55:44.240 --> 55:47.400
<i>They figured they had only one
chance of getting past the cavalry...</i>

55:47.640 --> 55:49.400
<i>...and they had a plan.</i>

55:50.920 --> 55:54.120
<i>They'd got the squaw so drunk
she couldn't talk.</i>

55:54.880 --> 55:58.320
<i>Two of Baker's men were going to
ride her right into the camp...</i>

55:59.000 --> 56:02.080
<i>...making out they were
being chased by Apaches.</i>

56:02.640 --> 56:06.000
<i>And while Hachita, Besh and Monkey
were carrying on...</i>

56:06.240 --> 56:08.200
<i>...as though they were
a whole raiding party...</i>

56:09.160 --> 56:12.000
<i>...all the rest were going to
take off a different way.</i>

56:12.280 --> 56:15.520
<i>If it all went well,
they'd meet up later.</i>

56:16.160 --> 56:17.560
<i>That was the plan.</i>

56:17.920 --> 56:21.440
<i>And with a little bit of luck,
it just could work.</i>

56:49.440 --> 56:50.720
Apaches are approaching!

56:55.560 --> 56:56.600
What's going on?

56:57.360 --> 56:58.280
I can't tell, sir.

57:19.800 --> 57:20.800
We're coming in!

57:21.520 --> 57:23.480
Don't shoot!
We're coming in!

57:23.760 --> 57:25.720
- It's a squaw!
- She's tied to the horse!

57:30.240 --> 57:31.640
Easy, easy.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.560
Hey, where's the sergeant?

58:22.200 --> 58:24.440
Get out of the way.
Out of the way!

58:27.160 --> 58:28.640
All right, let go.

58:33.280 --> 58:35.320
What the hell's going on here,
Sergeant?

58:35.560 --> 58:36.720
Pie-eyed, sir.

58:36.960 --> 58:40.480
I'll get black coffee into her.
Maybe we'll make sense out of this.

58:40.680 --> 58:43.440
All right, the party's over.
Get back to your posts.

58:43.680 --> 58:45.600
Do you hear me?
Move!

59:14.920 --> 59:16.920
<i>So now they were all together.</i>

59:17.120 --> 59:19.720
<i>The good citizens
and the outlaws...</i>

59:20.480 --> 59:22.640
<i>...and Mackenna and the girl.</i>

59:23.920 --> 59:27.040
<i>They made for the water hole
at the old Brogan ranch.</i>

59:27.280 --> 59:31.040
<i>It was the last chance
to fill up before they hit the desert.</i>

59:33.200 --> 59:37.800
<i>The Apaches had burned out the old
Brogan place about five years before.</i>

59:38.640 --> 59:42.240
<i>Nobody ever took it over
because it was too far out.</i>

59:43.800 --> 59:47.920
<i>But everybody knew about
the water hole, and everybody used it.</i>

59:48.600 --> 59:50.080
<i>It was kind of...</i>

59:50.320 --> 59:52.280
<i>...neutral territory.</i>

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.200
It's the cavalry!

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.160
We're surrounded.
It's the cavalry!

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.200
I'm John Fuller!

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.320
You're making a mistake!

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.360
I'm John Fuller!

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.760
I'm editor of the <i>Gazette.</i>

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.720
I've captured Colorado!

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.120
Don't shoot!

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.040
I've captured Colorado!

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.720
I've got old man Adams here.
Don't shoot, please!

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.520
Ride in this country without a gun...

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.080
Very reckless.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.440
I knew we could depend on you.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:05.920
Miss?

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.440
Leave her alone.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.920
I mean leave her!

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.600
We're back to the way
things were.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.160
You gave her to me.
Don't you remember?

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.840
We're out of water and
she's slowing us up.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.360
So leave her.

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:42.880
Get out of the way.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.960
I'm not much good to you dead.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:01.920
Has it crossed your mind that you'll
never see that canyon if you kill me?

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:07.320
I won't kill you,
but I'll hurt you awful bad.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.880
So get out the way.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.840
There's plenty of water...

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.360
...less than 2 hours from here.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.360
You crazy?

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.120
Just keep your eye on the dealer.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.720
You're good.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.720
You're really good!

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.520
For this, I give you Monkey's share.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.960
Come on, enjoy!

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.160
Mr. Mackenna?

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.920
I want to thank you.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.640
For everything.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.000
That's all right.

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:53.520
Your father and I never had
much to say to each other, but...

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:54.840
...he was a good man.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.840
That's lucky for me.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:32.640
Excuse me, but is there something
between you and that Indian girl?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.600
There was, a long time ago.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:41.080
After I got the Marshal's job,
I had to go collect her brother.

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.480
Then he got himself hanged.

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.760
Don't make her mad.
She's kind of crazy.

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:56.560
Why aren't you married?

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.880
I never found a man who could
hold a candle to my father.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.600
I guess not.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.720
What's the matter with you?
You like to be dirty?

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.480
Show you a new way
to get your clothes clean.

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.800
I'll never understand the gringo.
Never!

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.200
It's your own fault!

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.320
You know Hesh-Ke.
You know she has a terrible temper.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:45.320
I'm sorry. If Hesh-Ke wants to kill
that girl, she'll do it. You know that.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.480
You gave her to me,
and I don't want her damaged.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.000
I can't watch her every minute.

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.240
What's the matter with you?

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.400
We've got enough partners now.

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.800
This will keep
those Apache happy for a while.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.240
Some scout!

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:36.360
<i>The man leading that cavalry patrol
was Sergeant Tibbs.</i>

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:39.400
<i>"Foxy" Tibbs, his men called him.</i>

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.560
<i>He knew his way around.</i>

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:56.320
<i>Old Foxy Tibbs and his 8 men
just kept following on.</i>

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:58.160
<i>Following on!</i>

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.520
<i>After the first day, he sent
two men back to the company...</i>

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:13.640
<i>...so they could show
the lieutenant the trail.</i>

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.920
<i>Every day after, he kept sending
two more men back...</i>

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.800
<i>...in kind of a relay.</i>

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:25.120
<i>And he hung on their heels...</i>

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.720
<i>...fast or slow.</i>

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.520
<i>Finally...</i>

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:39.560
<i>...it was five against five.</i>

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.720
You two in the back, get going.

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.160
Good!

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:37.120
Now we can double back
and take them one by one.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.200
That's good.

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:41.440
When they see us coming...

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.360
...they can turn around and lead us
back to the whole company, 2 by 2.

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.800
Of course, they won't hang me.

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:58.440
I'll tell you what you can do.
Send the girl back to the troopers.

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:00.480
Why?

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:03.160
Like you said, she holds us up.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.480
They wouldn't be able to keep up
if they had her on their hands.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:13.600
All right.
You've probably got a better idea.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.080
I have no better idea.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.000
Only, this one better work.

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.480
It'll work. I'll tell her.

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.280
Sure, you tell her.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.720
- I can tell her.
- I know.

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:37.960
Miss...

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:42.080
...you're free to join those soldiers.
They'll get you home.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.360
But it wouldn't be fair
to leave you here all alone.

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.000
He's not alone. He's got me!

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.320
I think I should stay, Mr. Mackenna.

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:53.280
Lady, you better go before
I change my mind.

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:57.880
I'll come by for supper
some night, when I get back.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.520
Stay here.
And keep your eyes open.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.520
That gets rid of her, anyway.

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.720
You've had a hard time.
You have my sympathy.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.240
Thank you.

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:03.840
Sergeant, you will be able to
help Mr. Mackenna?

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.120
Yes. I think I can.

01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.440
<i>Now there were only
4 of them left.</i>

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:25.240
<i>That made the odds
a little better for Mackenna.</i>

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:29.960
<i>Only thing was, Hesh-Ke had ideas.</i>

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.960
<i>She wanted Mackenna back now.</i>

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:39.000
<i>Now the girl was gone, she figured
there was nothing to stop her.</i>

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.000
Thanks.

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.000
Don't make her mad.

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:26.840
Someone comes.

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.520
Stop! Now!

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.080
Take it easy. I'm coming in.

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.240
Take it slow.

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:07.040
Stay where you are.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.200
I've come to join up.

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:14.520
I hope there won't be any
trouble about it.

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:17.440
- You expect us to believe that?
- Don't!

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:21.000
He's a murderer. He killed two men.
His own men!

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:22.800
That's right.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:27.320
That means I have two extra horses.
Good horses.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:29.760
They'll come in real handy
when we've found the gold.

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.800
The little lady here
told me all about it.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:37.280
I already had a pretty good idea
from the squaw.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.560
All right.
But you're a foolish man.

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:46.560
Suppose we say okay now,
and in the night we change our minds?

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:49.000
Tonight, tomorrow night.
You've got to sleep sometime.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:53.000
I'll get my sleep.
There's no point in killing me.

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:55.080
Not for one share, more or less.

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:57.800
Besides, you need me.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:01.120
We don't need you.
We've got enough trouble without you.

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:05.240
The whole army will be out looking for
you, more anxious to hang you than me.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:09.800
They'll think you did it,
or Apache, and I was taken prisoner.

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:12.680
During all this time that I've been
chasing you around...

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:16.000
...I've thought it all out.
You do need me.

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:21.840
You know how much gold weighs?
You especially, Mr. Mackenna?

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:25.160
And how much is there, a million?
More? In raw gold.

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:28.000
There aren't enough of us
to carry it out.

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:31.640
With me, you've got a better chance
of getting there and out alive.

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:35.520
You're right, Sergeant.

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:37.720
You're welcome, Sergeant!

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.160
Coffee for the sergeant!

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.160
Only, don't forget...

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.840
...I'm the captain!

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.240
A sergeant who kills two
of his own troopers.

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:55.040
- What do you think of that?
- Not a hell of a lot.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.640
Now, be reasonable, Mackenna.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:00.480
Thank you.

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.560
After all, a man of my age
and rank...

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:05.400
...there's no future for me
in the army.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.080
Do you mind, Sergeant?

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.440
Why don't you stay with
your new partners?

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:13.640
No hard feelings I hope,
Miss Bergerman.

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.520
Easy, friend.

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.520
Mackenna's too precious to me.

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:36.120
Miss Bergerman, huh?

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:41.720
Could it be she's the little girl of
my old friend, the judge?

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:48.160
We will never be true friends
if you keep secrets from me.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:52.840
Let's go.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.520
<i>To get away from the cavalry,
they headed for the Yellow River ferry.</i>

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:32.960
<i>They figured they could cross over
on the raft there...</i>

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:36.320
<i>...then double back on the trail later.
What they didn't know...</i>

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:40.920
<i>...was that the Apaches had
taken over the Yellow River territory.</i>

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.800
<i>And there was another thing
they didn't know.</i>

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
<i>Some other Apaches had already
burned down the ferry.</i>

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.920
<i>But they'd been in a hurry,
and the raft was still afloat.</i>

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.400
<i>They still had a chance.</i>

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.120
Help me!
The current's too strong!

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:10.000
Get out of here!

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.600
Damn Prairie Dog!

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:29.040
And don't you go saying
we ought to take him with us.

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.600
All right, let's go.

01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:51.240
<i>Now they were there.
They'd reached it.</i>

01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:53.600
<i>They'd reached the place
Mackenna knew as...</i>

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:56.160
<i>...Shaking Rock.</i>

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:00.800
We're here.

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:09.320
Where's the canyon?

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:14.240
Tomorrow. Sunrise.

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:15.920
Who says?

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:20.040
The map says.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.680
You nervous?

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:07.760
No. Just thinking.

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.640
When we get into that
canyon tomorrow...

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:14.240
Not "we," Sergeant.

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:15.680
I'm not going in.

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:17.240
Maybe.

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.880
You might change your mind.

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:24.560
We both know that Colorado's not going
to share the gold with anybody.

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:26.800
You had time to
figure that out, did you?

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.200
Enough.

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:31.800
Now look. You and I,
we ought to stick together.

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.480
The way you stuck to
your soldiers?

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.200
This is where the map ends.

01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:57.760
I expect you to keep your word.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Show me the canyon, and I will.

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:05.880
If it's anywhere around here,
you'll see it tomorrow morning.

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:07.680
I want my guns.

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:09.880
And I want the girl.

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.280
- Tomorrow.
- And if there's no gold...

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:14.480
...I still get the guns and the girl.

01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.280
There is gold.

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:23.480
You'll never know, if you
shove that thing any farther.

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:28.720
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:39.160
What will you do with it?

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.880
Your share, I mean.

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:43.480
My business.

01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:46.200
All right.

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:48.160
I know what you think.

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:54.560
One big drunk in every stinking saloon
in Sonora, till it's all gone, huh?

01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:57.400
Is that all you think I want?

01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.560
That's the way
it's always been with you.

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:03.040
Sure, because there was never enough
for what I really want.

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.240
But when I get the gold...

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:09.080
...they'll never see Colorado
around here again. Never.

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:12.280
Good. Where will you go?

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.120
Sorry.

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:22.840
Maybe I will tell you.

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:25.240
But if you laugh...

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.480
I won't laugh.

01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:15.520
A millionaire in Paris.

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:20.000
That's right.

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:03.240
What is it?

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:07.720
For what it's worth, he says
he'll let us go tomorrow morning.

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.840
I don't know what's going
to happen...

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:13.840
...but from the minute you wake up,
keep your eye on me.

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.600
However it goes, we'll
have to move fast.

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:17.760
Do we have to?

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:20.440
Can't we just see the gold first?

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:23.960
There isn't any gold.

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:27.880
But there was a map. You saw it.
It brought us here.

01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:30.200
You said we could see
the canyon in the morning.

01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:35.000
I said a lot of things to stay alive.
I'm running the bluff of my life.

01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:37.440
Tomorrow morning is the showdown.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.880
But we've come so far!
And then not even to see it?

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:43.000
No, listen!

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:46.320
My father wasn't rich.
After my mother died...

01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:49.440
...I wasn't only his daughter,
I was his ranch hand...

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:52.200
...because we couldn't afford
to keep one.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.360
But with my share...

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:57.720
...I could buy a real ranch.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:58.880
A big one.

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.640
If I had your place I wouldn't
be Marshal for 5 minutes.

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:02.880
You don't have to.

01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:05.720
With your share, you can
do anything you want.

01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:08.120
You like to gamble.
Build a gambling house.

01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:09.320
I'll be your partner.

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:11.040
You're out of your mind!

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:12.040
Now wake up!

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:15.320
Your share, my share.
There won't be any shares!

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:18.840
I know him.
He doesn't share with anybody.

01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:31.640
I'm sorry.

01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:35.880
I must be crazy.

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:40.840
You've done so much for me.
Everything.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.120
And I'm nothing but trouble.

01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:48.640
I don't know why you bother with me.

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:54.880
I have to.

01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:56.720
We're partners.

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:31.960
Well, what happens?

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:33.920
I never would have believed it.

01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:37.280
I think...

01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:40.280
...you'll see that canyon
in about a minute.

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:43.760
My guns!

01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:46.160
No, not till I see the canyon.

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:48.560
All right.

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:50.520
Look at the rock!

01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.720
Watch that shadow.

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.720
- What makes this?
- I don't know.

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.480
Might be a quartz deposit.

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.280
Look!

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:30.920
Come on!

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:07.160
Up there!

01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.600
Mackenna, look!

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:47.680
- I'm covered in gold!
- Come on. We're getting out.

01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:49.920
- Getting out? No!
- Listen to me!

01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:52.320
If we don't get away,
we'll be killed.

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:56.400
We're not staying, not for
all the gold in the world.

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:31.840
No bullets.

01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:33.880
I take them all.

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:35.640
- When?
- Last night.

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:38.160
The spirits tell me what to do.

01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:40.760
This is Apache gold.

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:42.960
They tell me:

01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:47.200
"Kill everyone today."
Even you, Colorado.

01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:49.240
You are not Apache.

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:49.120
Don't look down.

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:51.240
Keep going!

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:54.080
Keep going! Climb!

01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:58.400
Come on, keep going!

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:42.040
Come on. Just a little further.
You can do it!

01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:47.680
Try! A little bit more.

01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:12.560
Come on, climb!

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.120
Climb!

01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:17.840
- I can't.
- Try!

01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:20.920
Goodbye, old friend.
No more jokes.

02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:42.640
Bye, Mackenna.

02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:46.800
You know I'm coming after you.

02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.480
Stay away from me.

02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:57.040
Find a hole, old friend.

02:00:58.320 --> 02:00:59.280
Make it deep.

02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:52.720
<i>One men will comes, and than will go</i>

02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:57.400
<i>Crawling like ants on the rocks below</i>

02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:02.120
<i>But they can't win,
they got to loose their skin</i>

02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:06.280
<i>If all they want is that
gold and gold</i>

02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:09.480
<i>Gold, gold, gold</i>

02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:11.880
<i>Just forget about that gold...</i>

02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:13.640
<i>Gold, gold...</i>

02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:19.680
<i>You can live without that gold...</i>

02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:22.480
<i>Forget that gold...</i>
