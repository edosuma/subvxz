00:04.917 --> 00:06.417
Guys, guys!

00:07.166 --> 00:09.583
Wanna know who just won
the districtwide spelling bee?

00:10.709 --> 00:13.250
M-E.

00:14.250 --> 00:15.625
"Meh"?

00:16.500 --> 00:18.083
It's "me," you toad.

00:19.208 --> 00:21.959
- What is that?
- The trophy I won.

00:22.041 --> 00:23.291
It's a bronze bee.

00:24.250 --> 00:25.959
I’ve got fillings bigger than that thing.

00:27.083 --> 00:29.583
I rode a little filly
named "perspicacious"

00:29.667 --> 00:31.500
all the way to the finish line.

00:33.041 --> 00:34.917
Now come on, who's the man?

00:35.875 --> 00:39.000
- Who's the man?
- Jack is the man!

00:39.083 --> 00:43.375
<i>Ho!</i>
- Jack! Jack! Jack!

00:43.458 --> 00:45.583
Thank you.
- Now thanks to Jack's routine,

00:45.667 --> 00:49.041
we've won our first
gymnastics trophy in 15 years.

00:54.667 --> 00:55.917
It wasn't really a routine.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.667
I was just trying to move fast enough
so no one would notice

00:57.750 --> 00:59.000
I was wearing a unitard.

01:03.875 --> 01:05.375
When you're wearing one of those things,

01:05.458 --> 01:07.959
even when you win, you lose.

01:08.959 --> 01:11.375
You know, I just won the first
spelling bee our school has ever--

01:11.458 --> 01:13.291
Hey, show us what you did to win, Jack.

01:13.375 --> 01:15.375
- Yeah!
- Go for it.

01:25.875 --> 01:27.500
Jack, I hope that this means

01:27.583 --> 01:29.458
that you're going to stay
on the gymnastics team.

01:29.542 --> 01:31.583
I told you, it was a one-time deal.

01:31.667 --> 01:32.875
I win you your trophy

01:32.959 --> 01:34.834
and you get a little visit
from the wedgie wizard.

01:36.125 --> 01:39.041
- I guess a deal's a deal.
- Just go with it.

01:42.500 --> 01:43.792
Hold that for me.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.125
Whoo!

01:48.667 --> 01:51.000
- Aah!
-

01:51.083 --> 01:53.375
Is that all you've got, punk?

01:58.208 --> 02:00.125
-
- All right, let's go.

02:01.000 --> 02:01.959
Milton, are you coming?

02:02.041 --> 02:03.834
Yeah, I’ll catch up
with you guys in a second.

02:03.917 --> 02:04.959
- All right.
- Okay.

02:08.917 --> 02:12.125
You know, you're just a little bee
with broken wings,

02:13.000 --> 02:16.875
but you, my friend,
are gonna hang with the big dogs.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.542
Whoa, whoa!

02:25.625 --> 02:27.709
Whoa, whoa!

02:29.959 --> 02:32.083
If you're my guardian angel,

02:32.208 --> 02:35.792
you sir, are awesome at your job!

02:37.875 --> 02:41.041

03:23.041 --> 03:25.208
And at the very last second he caught me.

03:25.291 --> 03:27.166
He put me down and walked away.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.709
The only thing that I know about him

03:28.834 --> 03:31.208
is that his nametag said "Yoshi Nakamura."

03:31.291 --> 03:33.917
- Huh, never noticed him before.
- Okay, hang on.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.875
So you didn't notice a 600-lb custodian,

03:37.959 --> 03:39.709
but you did notice when Donna Tobin

03:39.792 --> 03:41.792
changed her ponytail from left to right?

03:43.458 --> 03:46.375
Okay, first it was right to left,

03:47.250 --> 03:49.583
second, it wasn't a ponytail,

03:49.667 --> 03:50.917
it was a French braid.

03:51.667 --> 03:54.083
And third, maybe if that custodian

03:54.166 --> 03:56.959
had legs like Donna Tobin,
I would've noticed him too.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.875
Hey, big news, everybody.

04:00.959 --> 04:03.667
the magic shop across the mall
went out of business.

04:03.750 --> 04:06.208
They have to sell
everything at half price.

04:06.291 --> 04:07.792
I feel so bad for them.

04:08.959 --> 04:10.458
I think I’m gonna cry.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.750
It's a good thing I have
this handkerchief.

04:19.875 --> 04:22.792
Oh, lookit!

04:23.542 --> 04:25.542
Yo, I don't know how he's doing that, man,

04:25.625 --> 04:27.208
but it's freaking me out.

04:30.542 --> 04:32.875
Anyway, since the store closed,

04:32.959 --> 04:36.166
a storage space opened up in the basement
directly below us.

04:36.250 --> 04:39.750
- I finally have a place for all my stuff.
- It's about time.

04:39.834 --> 04:42.583
- This place is getting pretty cluttered.
- It is not.

04:43.250 --> 04:46.625
Rudy, this place looks like
a crazy old cat lady lives here.

04:47.083 --> 04:49.083
Okay, that is a bit of an exaggeration.

04:49.166 --> 04:50.208
Really?

04:59.625 --> 05:02.333
Okay, that is not my cat.

05:05.959 --> 05:07.667
Are you coming, Tip-tip?

05:20.333 --> 05:22.834
Uh, excuse me, Lonnie.

05:22.917 --> 05:25.000
What are you doing in my storage space?

05:25.083 --> 05:28.250
I have claimed this for Reptile World.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.500
Listen, you little lizard-loving freak,

05:30.583 --> 05:33.000
I want you
and all of your stuff out of here now.

05:34.166 --> 05:35.542
Uh-oh.

05:35.625 --> 05:38.583
I may have just let
a bearded skink slip out.

05:38.667 --> 05:42.083
Why can't you say you passed gas
like everyone else?

05:42.166 --> 05:45.041
A skink is a type of poisonous lizard.

05:45.125 --> 05:47.375
And-- ooh! No, do not move.

05:47.458 --> 05:48.709
He's on the back of your neck.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.917
Look, I’m not falling for that.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.250
And I’m telling you
for the last time, get your--

05:54.041 --> 05:55.792
Oh wow, is it getting warm in here?

05:55.875 --> 05:57.709
That's the first sign of a skink bite.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.583
Second sign is your tongue will go numb.

05:59.667 --> 06:01.291
You should seriously get some help.

06:01.375 --> 06:03.375
I’m not leaving. They can carry my...

06:03.458 --> 06:04.583
dead body out of here

06:04.667 --> 06:07.000
and I will still stand here
to make my point.

06:07.083 --> 06:10.709
Aah! Holy smokes, I’m on fire!

06:16.625 --> 06:18.500
Bringing presents to custodians?

06:18.583 --> 06:20.667
That's not cool. I mean, what's next?

06:20.750 --> 06:22.709
Asking the crossing guard to the prom?

06:23.750 --> 06:26.500
I already tried that,
but she just wants to be friends.

06:27.834 --> 06:30.125
I think it's sweet Milton
bought his new friend a cake.

06:30.208 --> 06:31.500
Thanks, Kim.

06:31.583 --> 06:33.792
See, when someone does something great--

06:33.875 --> 06:35.667
You know, save a life

06:36.458 --> 06:38.000
Or win a spelling bee--

06:39.125 --> 06:41.000
They should get some recognition.

06:53.458 --> 06:55.458
Whoa!

06:56.583 --> 06:58.500
Do you know what this means?

06:58.583 --> 07:00.667
I know exactly what this means--

07:00.750 --> 07:02.834
Our custodian's king of the babies.

07:08.959 --> 07:12.125
Hey, what are you doing in here?

07:12.208 --> 07:15.208
I thought I told you
this space is for Reptile World.

07:15.250 --> 07:18.792
Not anymore. You left, I moved in.

07:18.875 --> 07:20.417
Oh, and if you're looking
for your tortoise,

07:20.500 --> 07:22.000
I left it in the hallway this morning.

07:23.917 --> 07:25.458
You fool!

07:25.542 --> 07:27.417
He could be three
or four feet away by now.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.917
I have to go upstairs.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.875
Don't touch any of my stuff,
especially that massage chair.

07:34.959 --> 07:37.667
- Would you mind if i--
- No, no.

07:37.750 --> 07:40.375
You couldn't handle it.
That's way too much chair for you.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.041
- What?
- I’ll be right back.

07:44.750 --> 07:47.709
I will sit wherever I wanna sit.

07:49.458 --> 07:50.875
How is he gonna find out?

07:52.041 --> 07:53.417
Oh.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.875
Ooh.

07:56.250 --> 07:59.458
Oooh.

07:59.542 --> 08:01.125
This is nice.

08:03.041 --> 08:06.000
Let's see what this baby can do.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.083
Whoa, check it out, you guys.

08:17.166 --> 08:18.125
<i>There he is.</i>

08:18.208 --> 08:19.250
Well, come on.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.792
Mr. Nakamura,

08:21.875 --> 08:24.667
I just want to thank you
for saving my life the other day.

08:24.750 --> 08:27.333
That's what I do, mop up pudding barf,

08:27.417 --> 08:29.917
collect trash and catch flying boys.

08:30.458 --> 08:31.750
I’m living the dream.

08:33.208 --> 08:36.041
we stopped by your closet
and saw your newspaper clippings,

08:36.125 --> 08:37.834
your trophies and your medals.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.375
You're amazing!

08:39.875 --> 08:41.583
Then we checked you out on the Internet.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.667
You were a six-time sumo champion.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.625
Yeah, that match
where you lost your diaper thing

08:45.709 --> 08:47.583
and kept fighting, that was awesome!

08:48.083 --> 08:51.083
- And disturbing. But mostly awesome.
- Yeah.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.792
That was a long time ago.

08:53.875 --> 08:56.917
I used to be a hero in Japan
and now I plunge toilets.

08:57.875 --> 09:00.667
And you-- you either change your diet

09:00.750 --> 09:02.291
or use the bathroom at home, Jerry.

09:03.959 --> 09:05.083
Wait, you know my name?

09:05.166 --> 09:07.417
In the janitor's room
we call you the bowl-buster.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.083
You hear that, you guys?

09:10.166 --> 09:12.542
I’m the bowl-buster. Whoo!

09:14.125 --> 09:16.750
Sir, I love that awesome
victory dance you do.

09:16.834 --> 09:19.166
- The Nakamura stomp.
Yeah!

09:19.250 --> 09:21.458
That started when
I seen a spider in the ring.

09:21.917 --> 09:23.709
The crowd loved it, so I just ran with it.

09:23.792 --> 09:26.291
- Come on, man, do it for us.
- Yeah, come on, do it.

09:26.375 --> 09:27.750
Aw, I couldn't. I’m at work.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.333
Please? Just once.

09:30.875 --> 09:31.750
Fine.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.000
Just one for you, little buddy.

09:33.083 --> 09:34.542
Yeah!
- Come on, man.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.959
Ooh. Oops.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.709
- Look what you did!
- I’m sorry, sir.

09:53.792 --> 09:56.000
- We were just having a little fun.
- Oh, fun?

09:56.083 --> 09:59.792
I didn't hire you to jump around
like some hopscotching hippo.

10:00.458 --> 10:01.375
I got this.

10:02.333 --> 10:05.750
Mr. Nakamura would like you to talk to him
with a little more respect.

10:05.834 --> 10:09.542
So I don't talk to you with respect, huh?

10:09.625 --> 10:11.417
- Actually I said--
- This man used to be a hero,

10:11.500 --> 10:12.959
so he doesn't need this job.

10:13.041 --> 10:14.375
- Really?
- No, I really need the job--

10:14.458 --> 10:17.417
He demands you
to apologize to him right now.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.417
Really?

10:19.291 --> 10:20.458
Here's my apology,

10:21.166 --> 10:23.875
Nakamura, you're fired!

10:34.208 --> 10:36.500
- Milton, what were you thinking?
- I don't know.

10:36.625 --> 10:38.625
I thought by stepping up
and helping Nakamura

10:38.709 --> 10:41.125
I could be a hero for once, like you.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.583
Eh, I’m not a hero.

10:42.667 --> 10:45.667
<i>Oh, help! He stole my purse!</i>

10:47.333 --> 10:48.500
Aah!

10:52.417 --> 10:53.834
<i>Bless you, Jack.</i>

10:54.792 --> 10:56.583
Uh, what were we talking about again?

10:56.709 --> 10:59.166
Oh, you were just going on
about not being a hero.

11:03.959 --> 11:05.750
Guys, group meeting.

11:08.166 --> 11:11.500
Um, why is Weepy McHugie still here?

11:12.625 --> 11:14.250
The guy's been through a lot, Rudy.

11:14.375 --> 11:17.125
We found out why he gave up sumo
and left Japan in shame.

11:17.208 --> 11:19.083
65 wins in a row,

11:19.166 --> 11:22.667
then some rookie struts in and throws him
out of the ring like a moldy pear.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.250
You guys hiding pears over there?

11:24.792 --> 11:26.250
There's no pears, darlin'.

11:27.792 --> 11:30.917
As if that wasn't bad enough,
he lost his life's savings.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.375
- Wow, how did he do that?
- He went on a game show called

11:33.458 --> 11:35.083
"Are You Willing to Lose
Your Life's Savings?"

11:35.917 --> 11:36.959
Fix this.

11:37.041 --> 11:39.959
Once the food runs out,
we're gonna look tasty to that guy.

11:40.041 --> 11:41.250
Fix this.

11:42.792 --> 11:45.250
Hey, guys, I got an idea.

11:45.333 --> 11:46.375
Nakamura,

11:47.542 --> 11:48.875
Milton was right--

11:48.959 --> 11:51.917
You're not a custodian, you're a champion.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.834
And with our help, you'll get there again.

11:53.917 --> 11:55.792
I told you it was a long time ago.

11:56.709 --> 11:57.959
Why do you guys believe in me?

11:58.417 --> 12:00.709
Look, we live by something
called the Wasabi code.

12:00.792 --> 12:02.417
That means we never give up on each other.

12:03.542 --> 12:06.083
We just gotta find a way
to get you back on the horse.

12:06.166 --> 12:10.500
Uh, Jack, it'd probably
be safer if the horse got on his back.

12:13.291 --> 12:15.917
But, uh, you know, either way.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.125
Wasabi?

12:22.458 --> 12:24.208
Wasabi!

12:30.625 --> 12:33.333
Got your note.
I heard you wanted to see me.

12:33.375 --> 12:36.625
Listen, we gotta come to some sort of
an agreement about this space.

12:36.709 --> 12:38.125
We can't keep fighting like this.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.083
I’m not so sure I can trust you.

12:40.166 --> 12:42.375
Before this conversation goes any further,

12:42.458 --> 12:43.834
I wanna check you for weapons.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.792
<i>Lift your arms.</i>

12:50.583 --> 12:51.834
That's a lint roller

12:51.917 --> 12:53.500
and you're making
that noise with your mouth.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.959
Look, so we both want the space, right?

12:59.041 --> 13:00.333
It's nicer than my apartment,

13:00.417 --> 13:03.750
smells less lizardy
and has exactly 100% less Mother.

13:03.834 --> 13:05.375
You live with your mother?

13:05.458 --> 13:07.500
I would hardly call it living, fella.

13:07.583 --> 13:09.792
Why can't we just figure out
some way to share it?

13:09.875 --> 13:10.959
Huh.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.208
Are you thinking what I’m thinking?

13:15.750 --> 13:17.166
Man cave!

13:17.250 --> 13:18.750
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

13:19.542 --> 13:20.792
They're not back yet?

13:20.875 --> 13:23.750
Nakamura wanted to run one more lap
around the mall with his weight vest.

13:24.667 --> 13:28.250
-
- All right, that was your best time yet.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.000
You ran the entire mall
in under four minutes.

13:32.041 --> 13:35.500
Bouncing around in that thing
has given me a new respect for kangaroos.

13:38.583 --> 13:41.542
Hey, Nakamura,
I saw you running through the mall

13:41.625 --> 13:44.125
carrying a big pasty baby
that looked a lot like Milton.

13:44.917 --> 13:46.333
I’m not pasty.

13:47.041 --> 13:48.333
I’m translucent.

13:50.458 --> 13:52.041
Nakamura's training for his big comeback.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.333
A comeback sumo match,

13:55.375 --> 13:57.000
I bet people would buy tickets for that.

13:57.083 --> 14:00.000
I paid five bucks to watch
the Kellys' dog have puppies.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.959
I’ve seen the miracle of life...

14:03.041 --> 14:04.542
And it's disgusting.

14:06.458 --> 14:08.709
You know, we can have the match
right here in the dojo.

14:08.792 --> 14:10.125
Yeah, that's great and all,

14:10.208 --> 14:12.583
but we don't have another sumo wrestler
for him to compete against.

14:13.959 --> 14:15.041
I do.

14:21.333 --> 14:22.583
Oh, no.

14:22.667 --> 14:25.208
Beached whale! Somebody help me!

14:25.291 --> 14:27.291
We gotta haul it back to sea
before it dies!

14:32.709 --> 14:35.125
- Go to your home.
- What are you doing?

14:36.333 --> 14:37.709
No, I-- I--

14:37.792 --> 14:40.125
You thought I was a whale, didn't you?

14:40.208 --> 14:41.959
- Yeah, a little bit.
-

14:43.250 --> 14:45.917
We kept in touch. I’ll give him a call.

14:51.250 --> 14:52.709
Huh!

14:54.250 --> 14:58.083
All right, Nakamura,
Time for your real workout.

14:58.166 --> 14:59.542
Let's belly up!

15:01.125 --> 15:02.834
Jerry, how's this thing gonna help?

15:03.417 --> 15:05.375
You look like a bloated turkey in a thong.

15:06.458 --> 15:08.125
It's gonna make him quicker.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.959
I’m scrappy and wiry.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.291
Now come on, big guy.

15:13.917 --> 15:15.417
Whoa!

15:24.166 --> 15:26.375
Hey. A little help. Thanks.

15:29.959 --> 15:32.041
I’m good. I’m good.

15:37.166 --> 15:38.542
I’m telling you, Lonnie, I’m gonna make

15:38.625 --> 15:40.375
- a fortune off this sumo match.
-

15:40.458 --> 15:43.542
Do you mind?
I am trying to watch the finale

15:43.625 --> 15:45.500
of "America's Got Tap Shoes."

15:46.208 --> 15:47.834
No, no, later for that.

15:47.917 --> 15:51.458
It's time for "Ultimate Combat"
on the Violence Channel.

15:51.542 --> 15:55.208
I am not watching a bunch
of girlie men slap each other

15:55.291 --> 15:56.750
when there's tap dancing on.

15:57.375 --> 15:59.583
Sure. Give me the remote!

15:59.667 --> 16:01.834
No, you don't. Oh, no, you do not!

16:04.458 --> 16:05.667
Are you happy?

16:05.750 --> 16:08.083
Now one of us has to get off the couch
to change the channel.

16:08.166 --> 16:10.542
All right, I was being unreasonable.

16:10.625 --> 16:13.250
It is your turn. You may have the remote.

16:13.333 --> 16:14.750
Thank you.

16:17.834 --> 16:20.166
- What are you doing?
- The man cave is under new management.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.041
You are out and I am in.

16:23.291 --> 16:24.792
Open the gate, Lonnie.

16:24.875 --> 16:27.250
Not gonna happen, Rudes.

16:27.333 --> 16:30.417
Oh, yeah, and I made a few adjustments
to the security system.

16:34.291 --> 16:36.917
Shocking, isn't it?

16:38.959 --> 16:41.375
Tap for me, America. Tap!

16:41.500 --> 16:43.250
-
- Aah!

16:46.625 --> 16:47.750
Enjoy the match.

16:48.417 --> 16:49.458
Enjoy the match.

16:50.083 --> 16:51.583
Enjoy the match.

16:58.583 --> 17:00.375
All right, my man, limber up, okay?

17:00.458 --> 17:01.667
Stretch yourself out.

17:01.750 --> 17:04.333
Just remember
everything I showed you, okay?

17:04.417 --> 17:06.709
Now come on, let's do this.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.875
Oh, wow.

17:09.959 --> 17:12.625
Skin on skin. That was pretty awkward.

17:14.792 --> 17:18.709
Ah, there's my man, Yamazaki.
My beach buddy.

17:18.792 --> 17:20.291
Got my 600 bucks?

17:23.834 --> 17:25.041
Let's do this.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.417
Uh-oh.

17:35.542 --> 17:38.125
Nakamura, you can't
hide in here... Or anywhere.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.625
I’m not going out there. That's Yamazaki.

17:41.709 --> 17:43.291
He's the only one that ever beat me.

17:44.041 --> 17:46.458
- I can't fight him, man.
- Nakamura! Nakamura!

17:46.542 --> 17:48.208
Guys, we gotta put on a fight.

17:48.375 --> 17:49.417
The crowd's getting ugly

17:49.500 --> 17:51.250
and they were none too pretty
to begin with.

17:52.166 --> 17:53.458
This is all my fault.

17:54.458 --> 17:56.709
Nakamura! Nakamura!

17:56.792 --> 17:59.000
-
- Nakamura, listen to me.

17:59.792 --> 18:01.792
You can't be running
from this guy your whole life.

18:03.542 --> 18:04.834
I’m sorry, Jack.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.291
I just can't go through with this.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.208
You guys gotta see this.
You're not gonna believe it.

18:32.333 --> 18:33.709
Come on, Milton.

18:36.250 --> 18:37.792
- Come on!
<i>Milton!</i>

18:39.083 --> 18:41.959
Your little kangaroo baby
has the heart of a lion.

18:42.041 --> 18:45.709
This is your moment.
Go out there and take it!

18:45.750 --> 18:48.166
-
- Ooh. Wow.

18:48.792 --> 18:50.208
Skin on skin.

18:50.291 --> 18:51.375
Awkward.

18:54.250 --> 18:55.542
Whoa.

19:00.041 --> 19:01.333
Aah!

19:11.041 --> 19:12.500
I got this one, Milton.

19:14.834 --> 19:16.375
You go, boy.

19:41.417 --> 19:44.458
Milton, that was crazy.
Why would you do that?

19:44.542 --> 19:46.750
I don't know. Someone had to do something.

19:46.834 --> 19:48.333
I would never have done that.

19:48.417 --> 19:50.375
That guy is the size of a brontosaurus.

19:50.458 --> 19:51.750
You know what this means?

19:51.834 --> 19:54.041
He has a second brain
that controls his tail?

19:54.125 --> 19:57.125
No, Milton. It means you're a hero.

19:57.250 --> 19:59.834
You inspired Nakamura
to get his confidence back.

19:59.917 --> 20:02.500
- You were awesome!
- Really, Jack?

20:02.583 --> 20:04.709
Yeah. And you know what else is awesome?

20:04.792 --> 20:07.500
Pants. Seriously, dude, put 'em on.

20:10.208 --> 20:13.375
- Yeah!
- Nakamura Stomp!

20:13.458 --> 20:17.208
Nakamura Stomp! Nakamura Stomp!

20:17.250 --> 20:18.834
Nakamura Stomp!

20:18.917 --> 20:20.458
-
Whoa!

20:20.542 --> 20:22.667
<i>And now it's time
to find out the winner of...</i>

20:22.750 --> 20:25.000
- Do you mind?
- <i>..."America's Got Tap Shoes."</i>

20:25.083 --> 20:26.750
I’m trying to watch TV down here.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.417
<i>Are you ready for the results?</i>

20:28.500 --> 20:30.333
Yes. Give it to me.

20:30.750 --> 20:32.041
Whoa!
-

20:32.125 --> 20:33.500
Give it to me!

20:33.583 --> 20:34.709
Whoa!
-

20:34.792 --> 20:37.500
Give it to-- Whoa!

20:39.250 --> 20:41.709
Well, look who dropped in.

20:42.583 --> 20:45.083
-
- Sweet man cave.

20:46.709 --> 20:48.375
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

20:54.125 --> 20:56.083
Thanks to Milton,
Nakamura's heading back to Japan

20:56.166 --> 20:56.875
to get his title back.

20:56.959 --> 20:59.417
You know, I could be a sumo wrestler.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.959
I just need to gain like 500-600 lbs.

21:02.041 --> 21:04.041
- Your mom did it pretty easily.
- That's it, man.

21:04.125 --> 21:05.917
- Come on!
-

21:07.875 --> 21:09.875
Jack, have you seen
my spelling bee trophy?

21:10.333 --> 21:12.542
I thought it was in my locker,
but I can't find it anywhere.

21:13.542 --> 21:16.166
I know it's small,
but it means a lot to me.

21:16.250 --> 21:19.083
Don't worry, Milton.
I’m sure it's someplace safe.
