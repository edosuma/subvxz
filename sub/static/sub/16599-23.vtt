Whew!

00:39.172 --> 00:40.072
(drill whirs)

00:40.107 --> 00:41.807
Hey, you know
something?

00:41.842 --> 00:42.875
Huh?

00:42.910 --> 00:45.177
I got to say, this is
coming along very nicely.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.611
I'm very happy
with what's happening

00:46.646 --> 00:48.080
in this room right now.

00:48.115 --> 00:49.314
We should try one
of those-- you know,

00:49.349 --> 00:50.515
we could host one
of those shows.

00:50.550 --> 00:51.783
You know, the shows where you

00:51.818 --> 00:53.351
renovate other people's houses
for 'em?

00:53.386 --> 00:54.586
Yeah, I do.
I hate those shows.

00:54.621 --> 00:56.154
You hate those shows?
Of course you do.

00:56.189 --> 00:58.256
'Cause they
make people happy, right?

00:58.291 --> 00:59.825
I think that that, uh,
glue you're using

00:59.860 --> 01:02.861
is making your head dopey.
That's what I think.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.430
No. Seriously, listen to me.
Aren't you having fun right now?

01:05.465 --> 01:07.332
We could, uh, you know,
forget the restaurant.

01:07.367 --> 01:09.201
This could be your new
career. What do you think?

01:09.236 --> 01:12.537
I think that you need a master's
degree in structural engineering

01:12.572 --> 01:15.273
to put this stupid bed together.
That's what I think.

01:15.308 --> 01:16.374
No.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.776
No. No, no, no,
no. No, don't.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.778
It doesn't go-- do not
screw that there, Danny.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.480
I know that. I'm not gonna
screw it down there.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.315
I know that, okay?

01:23.350 --> 01:24.583
I got an idea.

01:24.618 --> 01:27.619
Hey, why don't your read
the, uh, instructions?

01:27.654 --> 01:28.553
'Cause I don't have
the instructions.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.555
Where are they?
They're in the trash can.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.656
What?

01:31.691 --> 01:33.458
They're in the trash can, okay?!

01:33.493 --> 01:34.759
I threw them away.

01:34.794 --> 01:36.128
Why would you
throw the instructions away?

01:36.163 --> 01:37.362
I didn't think
I needed 'em

01:37.397 --> 01:38.563
to put together a child's bed.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.365
Okay.
- Instructions for what?

01:40.400 --> 01:41.833
So, you know the best
part about that, Danny,

01:41.868 --> 01:45.137
is that only a child would
throw away the instructions.

01:45.172 --> 01:46.605
Give me that screw gun.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.773
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Give-give it to me.

01:48.808 --> 01:52.144
You cannot be trusted
with the big boys' toys.

01:52.179 --> 01:53.745
You threw instructions away.
Give me the drill.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.514
(doorbell rings)
- No. Someone's at the door.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.415
Give me the screw gun. It's my
screw gun. It belongs to me.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.517
You're gonna get
the instructions?

01:58.552 --> 01:59.818
It's my drill
and it belongs to me

01:59.853 --> 02:00.819
and you just stole it.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.354
Get the instructions.

How you doing, Williams?
It's been a while.

Is this a bad time?

02:20.440 --> 02:21.506
Uh...

02:21.541 --> 02:23.542
No, no.
What could I help you with?

02:23.577 --> 02:24.609
Can I come in?

02:24.644 --> 02:27.179
Yeah, yeah.

how's retirement going?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.356
It's okay.

02:38.391 --> 02:39.624
Yeah?
- Hey,

02:39.659 --> 02:41.259
you know that homicide
on Puhano Street

02:41.294 --> 02:42.861
you worked when
you were with HPD?

02:42.896 --> 02:44.963
Uh, drug dealer got clipped.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.698
Case went cold when your
witness disappeared?

02:46.733 --> 02:48.333
Uh-huh.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.268
Aheahe Makino.
Uh, but he didn't disappear.

02:50.303 --> 02:52.404
He was killed
and we never found the body.

02:52.439 --> 02:53.805
Not exactly.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.608
Maybe that's because
there was no body to be found.

02:56.643 --> 02:58.810
What do you mean?

02:58.845 --> 03:00.312
Makino's alive, Williams.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.414
He's been up on
the North Shore

03:02.449 --> 03:03.515
for the past seven years.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.383
What's he been doing
for seven years?

03:05.418 --> 03:07.753
If I tell you,
you will never believe me.

03:11.391 --> 03:14.359
This is a<i> Hawaii News Now</i>
special report.

03:14.394 --> 03:16.361
Nestled in a secluded spot
on the North Shore,

03:16.396 --> 03:18.330
the Haleiwa
Assisted Living Center

03:18.365 --> 03:20.732
has offered peace and comfort
to many over the years.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.400
But one patient

03:22.435 --> 03:25.670
has captured the attention
of all who visit here.

03:25.705 --> 03:30.008
To the residents and staff,
he's simply known as "John Doe."

03:30.043 --> 03:31.876
But his real name,
like the circumstances

03:31.911 --> 03:35.347
that brought him here,
remain a mystery.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.516
He was found seven years ago
at the bottom of Ka'ena Point

03:38.551 --> 03:40.318
with severe head injuries,

03:40.353 --> 03:42.020
and has remained
in a coma ever since.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.289
WOMAN:
He had no identification,

03:44.324 --> 03:46.858
and when no one stepped forward
to claim him, we took him in.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.893
You know, I think most of us
have developed a bond

03:48.928 --> 03:50.328
with him over the years.

03:50.363 --> 03:52.764
John's been here longer
than some of the staff.

03:52.799 --> 03:55.767
I read to him every week,
just in case it helps, you know?

03:55.802 --> 03:57.335
We pray he'll wake up one day.

03:57.370 --> 04:00.505
We all want him
to get his life back.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.741
And now it seems their prayers
may soon be answered,

04:02.776 --> 04:05.610
after a routine test
earlier this week revealed

04:05.645 --> 04:08.513
elevated levels of sugar
metabolism in John Doe's brain.

04:08.548 --> 04:10.448
According to doctors,

04:10.483 --> 04:13.485
this type of activity
is a strong indicator

04:13.520 --> 04:16.488
he will soon
regain consciousness.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.823
(tablet beeps)
Well?

04:18.858 --> 04:20.859
I think you might be right.
This is Makino.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.661
If it is
and he comes out of that coma,

04:22.696 --> 04:24.563
you might just close this case
after all.

04:30.737 --> 04:34.039

05:04.771 --> 05:05.771

05:22.088 --> 05:23.521
when he got here
this morning.

05:23.556 --> 05:25.824
Cause of death was a GSW
to the back of the head.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.459
According to the M.E.,

05:27.494 --> 05:29.094
the vic was killed
sometime around midnight.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.895
Also, just a quick
heads up...

05:30.930 --> 05:33.565
DANNY: What's Tanaka doing here?
- I'm not sure.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.968
He's gonna give me grief
for beating me here, watch.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.003
TANAKA:
Detective Williams,

05:39.038 --> 05:40.104
so glad
you could make it.

05:40.139 --> 05:42.440
Hope you didn't have a hard
time finding this place.

Nice tie.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.650
Thanks. - (laughs) Okay,

05:52.685 --> 05:54.619
so here's the deal:
Governor Jameson's

05:54.654 --> 05:56.654
chief of staff lives
in this neighborhood

05:56.689 --> 05:58.390
and he's already
on my ass about it,

05:58.425 --> 06:00.458
so I want this
case closed fast.

06:00.493 --> 06:01.760
So, until then,

06:01.795 --> 06:03.595
constant updates.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.463
I'm living here
six months.

06:05.498 --> 06:06.765
He's still busting
my balls every day.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.566
Is he gonna
lighten up?

06:08.601 --> 06:10.769
Don't take it personal.
He's tough on all you<i> haoles.</i>

06:10.804 --> 06:12.771
That's what
I've been telling him.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.939
So, Vice, what, uh, what's
your interest in our dead guy?

06:14.974 --> 06:16.741
KAUAI: Your vic's
a street-level coke dealer.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.543
Been on our radar
a few months.

06:18.578 --> 06:19.744
Anyway, I'm gonna check
with my informants,

06:19.779 --> 06:21.913
shake a few trees.
I'll let you know

06:21.948 --> 06:23.748
if I find any leads.
Appreciate it.

06:23.783 --> 06:25.550
KAUAI:
Yeah, definitely.

06:25.585 --> 06:26.584
Good to meet you.
- Same here.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.486
I'll catch up with you
in a second, all right?

06:28.521 --> 06:29.654
All right.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.028
My man?

06:37.063 --> 06:38.463
Excuse me.

06:38.498 --> 06:41.633
How you doing?
Danny Williams.

06:41.668 --> 06:42.934
What's your name?

06:42.969 --> 06:44.869
Aheahe Makino.

06:44.904 --> 06:48.873
Hi. You, uh, you live
around this neighborhood?

06:48.908 --> 06:52.911
No. Uh, I mean,
I live close by.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.913
I'm just walking by.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.714
You walk by
this neighborhood a lot?

06:56.749 --> 06:57.815
Sometimes.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.519
How about last night?
Were you walking by last night?

07:01.554 --> 07:03.588
Last... last night? No.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.523
Okay, well, look,
here's the thing.

07:05.558 --> 07:07.192
There was, um, a murder.
Somebody got shot.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.894
I don't know if you know.
Um, and, uh, I'm hoping

07:09.929 --> 07:11.663
somebody saw something,
'cause most of the time,

07:11.698 --> 07:14.065
it's the only way
we solve these cases, so...

07:14.100 --> 07:17.802
Yeah. Sure, look,
um, I got to go.

07:17.837 --> 07:19.671
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.005
Wait one second, please.
Just, uh...

07:21.040 --> 07:22.540
This is my card.

07:22.575 --> 07:24.008
I just want to
give you my--

07:24.043 --> 07:26.578
they-they, like a goof,
they made my name wrong.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.513
They put "Donald."
It's actually "Danny."

07:28.548 --> 07:30.648
Okay? I'm waiting
to get new cards.

07:30.683 --> 07:32.884
Anyway, please take this.
If anything happens, uh,

07:32.919 --> 07:34.719
you remember something--
I don't know, anything--

07:34.754 --> 07:36.821
if you know anything,
just give me a call, please.

07:36.856 --> 07:39.224
Huh?

07:45.231 --> 07:47.732
(ventilator pumping)

07:49.736 --> 07:51.703
(door opens)

07:51.738 --> 07:53.838
I just spoke
with the administrator.

07:53.873 --> 07:55.807
She said he was found
by some hikers.

07:55.842 --> 07:56.975
This was all he had
on him.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.776
HPD ran prints.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.279
He wasn't in the system and
no hits in missing persons.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.848
I wasn't crazy.
This is Makino, right?

08:03.883 --> 08:04.816
Definitely him.

08:04.851 --> 08:06.284
TANAKA: Yeah, and I think
it's safe to assume

08:06.319 --> 08:07.485
he didn't trip and fall while hiking.
- No.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.855
We should probably get him in
protective custody right away.

08:10.890 --> 08:13.157
Probably a good idea.
If I saw that story in the news,

08:13.192 --> 08:15.560
there's a chance that whoever
threw Makino off the cliff

08:15.595 --> 08:16.861
saw it, too.

08:16.896 --> 08:19.564
(alarm blaring)

08:21.634 --> 08:23.768
(alarm continues)

08:25.572 --> 08:27.038
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

08:27.073 --> 08:28.907
We're on lockdown. There's been
some kind of security breach.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.575
Please get back into your room
and lock the door.

08:30.610 --> 08:33.611
This can't be
a coincidence.

08:33.646 --> 08:34.946
No. No, it can't be.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.892
(alarm blaring)

08:56.769 --> 08:58.269
(birds chirping)

08:58.304 --> 08:58.703

08:58.738 --> 09:02.006
(phone ringing)

09:02.041 --> 09:03.875
(chuckles): Oh. (phone beeps)

09:03.910 --> 09:05.243
Hey, guess what.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.979
I'm looking at
a fully assembled Mach Five.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.214
That-that's great.
Right now, I have a situation.

09:10.249 --> 09:12.250
Someone's trying
to kill my witness, Makino.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.085
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you talking about?

09:14.120 --> 09:15.887
I don't know
what's happening, okay?

09:15.922 --> 09:17.922
The whole place is
on lockdown right now.

09:17.957 --> 09:19.924
Uh, we need...
we need to move this guy.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.693
A guard has been killed
or something. I-I don't know.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.094
I don't know.
I could use some backup.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.896
HPD's 20 minutes out,
so, please,

09:24.931 --> 09:27.098
if you could, uh, if you could
get here, that would be great.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.099
Okay. Okay, I'm on the way.

09:28.134 --> 09:30.068
Don't listen to anything
I said over the years

09:30.103 --> 09:31.269
about driving
like a sane person.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.037
Just get here
as fast as you can, okay?

09:33.072 --> 09:35.773
(line beeps)
Okay?

09:35.808 --> 09:37.008
(alarm continues blaring)

09:37.043 --> 09:38.710

DANNY:
<i>Rachel, do me a favor.</i>

09:42.081 --> 09:43.881
Don't tell me how Grace
needs more friends.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.650
I know what she needs, okay?

09:45.685 --> 09:48.653
I-I didn't fly all the way to
Hawaii, move my whole life here,

09:48.688 --> 09:51.656
so you could sabotage my
relationship with my daughter.

09:51.691 --> 09:53.758
B-Because you keep doing this.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.193
You schedule a sleepover
on my weekend.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.662
And if I say no to her,
I'm the bad guy.

09:57.697 --> 10:01.099
Get to see her for two seconds,
and then she takes off.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.967
Okay, good. You know what?
Don't cancel it.

10:03.002 --> 10:05.003
Don't cancel it, but next time,
when it's your weekend,

10:05.038 --> 10:06.838
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
sign her up for space camp.

10:06.873 --> 10:07.872
(phone beeps)
Guys, everybody,

10:07.908 --> 10:09.974
this is still-- every time,
it makes me laugh.

10:10.009 --> 10:13.011
It gets funnier
every time, huh?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.245
Good. Great.

10:17.183 --> 10:18.249
You know they're only messing
with you 'cause they can tell

10:18.284 --> 10:19.917
it gets to you, right?
- Yeah, well,

10:19.952 --> 10:21.853
let 'em keep doing it,
'cause this stuff is not cheap.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.087
Also, look,
I don't know

10:23.122 --> 10:24.756
if anyone's mentioned
this to you yet,

10:24.791 --> 10:26.391
but I'd give some serious
thought to how you dress.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.394
I mean, you can't do anything
about your skin tone yet,

10:29.429 --> 10:32.764
but an aloha shirt and some
shades might go a long way.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.832

We didn't get disconnected,
I hung up on you.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.947
I hung up on you
because I am at work.

10:49.982 --> 10:52.116
I'm at work, the place
where I make money.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.252
Money so that I can buy things
like water park tickets

10:54.287 --> 10:56.187
that are gonna go to waste

Got a call for you.

11:00.259 --> 11:01.492
Hold on. Who is it?

11:01.527 --> 11:04.328
Some guy you gave your card to
at the crime scene this morning.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.048
We're on lockdown right now.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.084
That's-that's why we need
to move him, so come on.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.052
I'm sorry, but this patient
has to remain where he is.

11:28.087 --> 11:29.053
I'm not authorized to move
anyone during a lockdown.

11:29.088 --> 11:31.289
Well, then call somebody
who is authorized, okay?

You helping or what?
Let's go. Come on.

18:52.865 --> 18:53.898
We got to go.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.937
JERRY:
Her name's Lara Kendall.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.038
She's an alleged
contract killer.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.574
Been the suspect of
a couple hits on the mainland.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.409
I also ran the numbers
on her burner,

19:05.444 --> 19:07.478
and one of them matched
to this guy.

19:07.513 --> 19:08.812
Dario Mendez.

19:08.847 --> 19:10.381
According to HPD,

19:10.416 --> 19:12.249
he's the current head
of the Ochoa cartel.

19:12.284 --> 19:14.385
There's an outfit we haven't
heard from in a while.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.886
Oh, you dealt with them before?

19:15.921 --> 19:17.788
They used to be pretty big
in the coke trade.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.657
We took out their leadership
before you moved here.

19:19.692 --> 19:20.791
JERRY:
Well, it looks like

19:20.826 --> 19:21.725
they've been rebuilding
under Mendez.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.761
The homicide that
Danny was investigating

19:23.796 --> 19:25.729
seven years ago
was thought to be drug-related.

19:25.764 --> 19:27.731
The cartel must have been
behind that

19:27.766 --> 19:29.667
and the first attempt
on Makino's life.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.569
Whatever Makino saw,
the cartel could stand

19:31.604 --> 19:32.903
to lose a lot
if he ever testified.

19:32.938 --> 19:34.305
Which means our
little hit squad's

19:34.340 --> 19:35.639
not gonna give up
so easily.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.308
Let's go see Mendez.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.909
Force him to call off the dogs.

19:38.944 --> 19:40.911
All right.
Come on, come on, come on.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.947
(alarm continues blaring)

19:54.026 --> 19:56.394
MEKA:
<i>Guy was way out of line.</i>

19:57.896 --> 19:58.762
I mean, Tanaka insinuating

19:58.797 --> 20:01.232
that you're responsible
for losing Makino?

20:01.267 --> 20:02.433
That's crap, man.

20:02.468 --> 20:05.236
Guy called with information,
hung up before he said anything.

20:05.271 --> 20:06.404
That's not on you.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.007
There's nothing
you could have done.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.375
You get that, right?

20:13.279 --> 20:14.612
<i>(elevator bell dings)</i>

20:14.647 --> 20:17.281
(alarm continues blaring)

20:24.356 --> 20:26.958
All right, I'll meet
you guys down, okay?

20:39.772 --> 20:41.372
(two gunshots)

20:41.407 --> 20:42.740
(body thuds)

20:42.775 --> 20:44.775
(elevator bell dings)

20:46.679 --> 20:48.012
All right, come on.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.280
Come on, come on.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.290

21:12.771 --> 21:15.072
MAN: I got 'em.
West side of the building.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.308
They're getting into
an ambulance.

(screams)

21:50.542 --> 21:52.042
How's Makino?

21:52.077 --> 21:54.312
He's stable.

21:54.780 --> 21:56.046
Vitals are okay.

21:56.081 --> 21:57.748
I'm getting
a little carsick, though.

21:57.783 --> 21:59.783
I apologize. I'm just
trying to get as far away

21:59.818 --> 22:01.118
as possible, all right?

22:01.153 --> 22:01.785
(automatic gunfire)

22:01.821 --> 22:03.321
Is that...? (groans)
- Yeah.

22:06.892 --> 22:08.058
Hold on. Hang on to something,

22:08.093 --> 22:09.426
all right?

22:09.461 --> 22:10.895
(tires screeching)

22:23.642 --> 22:25.509

22:25.811 --> 22:27.644
You guys all right?

22:27.679 --> 22:28.913
Yeah.

22:40.459 --> 22:41.425
Hold on.

22:41.460 --> 22:42.860
(tires screeching)

22:57.509 --> 22:59.143
Did we lose them?

22:59.178 --> 23:00.544
I don't know.

23:00.579 --> 23:02.413
(ventilator beeping rapidly)

23:02.448 --> 23:03.514
Oh, that can't be good.

23:03.549 --> 23:04.982
What is that?
- His oxygen!

23:05.017 --> 23:07.518
I've got to patch the hole
in his breathing tube.

23:07.553 --> 23:10.554
Go in this cabinet, please.
Give me the surgical tape.

23:20.566 --> 23:23.100

23:23.135 --> 23:24.568

23:25.637 --> 23:26.737
DANNY:
Hurry up with that.

23:26.772 --> 23:28.072
Hurry up.
- I got it.

23:36.548 --> 23:38.449
Listen to me.

23:38.484 --> 23:40.184
<i>I'm gonna make</i>
<i>a right-hand turn.</i>

23:40.219 --> 23:41.785
When they follow,
I want you to lean out the back

23:41.820 --> 23:43.587
and light 'em up, okay?
Got it.

24:05.744 --> 24:07.010
DANNY:
<i>Hang on!</i>

24:07.045 --> 24:08.545
(screams)
- (groans)

24:08.580 --> 24:10.647
Just when you think
it couldn't get any worse!

24:10.682 --> 24:11.982
All right, I got an idea.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.686
(groans)

24:20.559 --> 24:22.893
They won't get far
on those tires.

24:22.928 --> 24:24.628
Let's go.

24:29.268 --> 24:31.235
Aloha.
Are your folks home?

24:31.270 --> 24:33.537
Hi. Uh, I'm a...
I'm a police officer.

24:33.572 --> 24:34.538
Um, are your mom
and dad home?

24:34.573 --> 24:35.639
They're still at work.

24:35.674 --> 24:36.974
At work.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.609
You got any friends
that live in the neighborhood?

24:38.644 --> 24:40.010
Good. I want you to go
to their house. Don't come back.

24:40.045 --> 24:41.211
Do not come back.

24:41.246 --> 24:43.714
Run fast, okay? Go on.

24:43.749 --> 24:44.982
Like she's not gonna be
having nightmares

24:45.017 --> 24:46.750
for the rest of her life.
Yeah, well, she got

24:46.785 --> 24:49.152
a good story to tell now.
Let's go.

24:49.187 --> 24:52.723
DANNY: I stashed the
ambulance behind the house.

24:52.758 --> 24:54.591
How's he doing?
- His ventilator's

24:54.626 --> 24:56.660
almost out of juice, so we
had to plug it into an outlet.

24:56.695 --> 24:58.529
Good job.

24:58.564 --> 25:00.697
What? I plugged a thing
into a thing. (chuckles)

25:00.732 --> 25:02.132
I don't mean that specifically.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.101
In general, good job.
You didn't have to, um...

25:04.136 --> 25:06.837
Um, yeah, I did.

25:06.872 --> 25:07.771
Thank you.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.910
Hey, buddy, listen.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.678
Uh, I'm almost at the precinct.
You there yet?

25:14.713 --> 25:16.680
No, not exactly.
We got a little sidetracked.

25:16.715 --> 25:18.315
We made it about four miles,
and now I'm hunkered down

25:18.350 --> 25:19.283
in some house.

25:19.318 --> 25:22.185
Okay. What happened
to going to the station?

25:22.220 --> 25:24.621
Uh, car trouble.

25:24.656 --> 25:26.623
Fine, whatever.
What's the address?

25:26.658 --> 25:28.825
I don't know the address. It
says "five" on the mailbox.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.027
You don't know where you are?

25:30.062 --> 25:31.995
It's a house, Steve.
It's a house.

25:32.030 --> 25:32.829
I didn't see a street sign.

25:32.864 --> 25:33.797
There's trees
all over the place.

25:33.832 --> 25:35.666
There's a driveway,
nice grass out front.

25:35.701 --> 25:36.867
It's a house.
Relax. Just relax, all right?

25:36.902 --> 25:38.936
We're tracking your phone.
Jerry. Jerry.

25:38.971 --> 25:41.271
You there? Can you get a fix
on the location?

25:41.306 --> 25:42.973
Negative.
The signal's not strong enough.

25:43.008 --> 25:44.841
Well, okay.
Well, can you triangulate it?

25:44.876 --> 25:46.209
He's not close
to any cell towers.

25:46.244 --> 25:48.645
The best I can give you
is a half-mile radius.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.147
You'll be in the area
about ten minutes.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.315
DANNY:
Ten minutes?

25:51.350 --> 25:52.783
I could be dead in ten minutes.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.019
STEVE:
Just hang tight, buddy.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.055
Okay? Chin, Kono and Grover

25:58.090 --> 25:59.623
have got a lead on

25:59.658 --> 26:01.592
who's behind this,
and they're moving in now, okay?

26:05.697 --> 26:07.831
Dario Mendez! Five-O!

26:12.638 --> 26:15.772
If you would've knocked,
I would've come to the door.

26:15.807 --> 26:17.774
All right, wise-ass.

26:17.809 --> 26:19.309
We're gonna keep this simple.

26:19.344 --> 26:21.745
We know you put a hit

26:21.780 --> 26:23.380
on Aheahe Makino this morning.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.215
Now you're gonna call it off.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.051
Unlikely, since I have
no idea who that is.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.720
CHIN: You know
exactly who that is.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.656
And you also know he witnessed
an Ochoa cartel execution

26:32.691 --> 26:33.724
back in 2010.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.225
You think we would wait
seven years

26:35.260 --> 26:37.127
to do something about that?
KONO: Cut the crap.

26:37.162 --> 26:39.162
We both know
you thought you handled it then.

26:39.197 --> 26:40.964
We also know
why you're so desperate

26:40.999 --> 26:42.933
to make sure
it gets handled now.

26:42.968 --> 26:44.668
Who do you think
you're talking to?

26:44.703 --> 26:45.802
We know that you were

26:45.837 --> 26:47.671
the cartel's triggerman
back then.

26:47.706 --> 26:49.640
So you were the one
responsible for the hit.

26:49.675 --> 26:52.809
So you could be the one that
Makino I.D.s when he wakes up.

26:52.844 --> 26:54.745
And you have proof of this?

26:54.780 --> 26:56.179
KONO:
You sent a contract killer

26:56.214 --> 26:58.048
and a small army
after a man in a coma.

26:58.083 --> 26:59.349
You wouldn't have gone
to those lengths

26:59.384 --> 27:00.717
if you didn't have
something personal to lose.

27:00.752 --> 27:02.419
GROVER:
So, call it off,

27:02.454 --> 27:03.920
Mendez.

27:03.955 --> 27:05.889
Call it off now.

27:08.794 --> 27:12.863
The only call I'm making
right now is to my lawyer.

27:12.898 --> 27:14.731
That's not gonna happen.

27:14.766 --> 27:17.367
Because now we got a friend
caught up in this.

27:17.402 --> 27:19.936
Daddy?

27:19.971 --> 27:22.739
<i>Mijo.</i>

27:22.774 --> 27:25.275
(speaking Spanish)

27:38.490 --> 27:40.290
What are you looking for?
Saw a hunting trophy

27:40.325 --> 27:41.892
in the other room.
I'm looking for a gun.

27:41.927 --> 27:43.727
We got a gun.
Yeah, I know we got guns.

27:43.762 --> 27:44.761
The people that are
looking for us

27:44.797 --> 27:47.898
have fully automatic weapons.
You understand?

27:47.933 --> 27:50.734
You blame me for all this,
don't you?

27:50.769 --> 27:52.769
Excuse me? Blame you for what?

27:52.804 --> 27:55.739
We wouldn't be here right now
if I hadn't reassigned you.

27:55.774 --> 27:57.340
But, Danny, I had to.

27:57.375 --> 27:59.209
And it wasn't about you.

27:59.244 --> 28:01.812
Okay.

28:01.847 --> 28:04.114
(sighs)
I thought after seven years,

28:04.149 --> 28:05.882
you would have
gotten over it.

28:05.917 --> 28:06.850
I am over it.
I'm completely over it.

28:06.885 --> 28:07.918
Okay?
- Hey.

28:07.953 --> 28:10.821
Will you listen to me?
I am trying to apologize.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.222
Look at this. You know what?

28:12.257 --> 28:13.990
I didn't ask for apology, okay?

28:14.025 --> 28:14.991
We're fine.

28:15.026 --> 28:16.293
However I felt about you,

28:16.328 --> 28:18.395
losing Makino
was not your fault.

28:18.430 --> 28:19.963
I don't want to talk
about this right now!

28:19.998 --> 28:21.364
Put these bullets in that gun.

28:21.399 --> 28:23.233
I pulled you off the case.
It was my bad.

28:23.268 --> 28:25.402
No, it wasn't your bad.
It was not your bad.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.170
It was my bad.
Okay? Let's go.

28:27.205 --> 28:31.174
Look, a witness called.
He hung up. End of story.

28:31.209 --> 28:34.144
No. No, that's not the end
of story. You don't get it.

28:34.179 --> 28:35.245
What don't I get?

28:35.280 --> 28:37.380
He didn't hang up on me, okay?
What?

28:37.415 --> 28:39.015
He did not hang up on me.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.517
MAN:
<i>Williams.</i>

28:40.552 --> 28:42.853
Got a call for you.
Hold on. Who is it?

28:42.888 --> 28:45.088
Some guy you gave your card to
at the crime scene this morning.

28:45.123 --> 28:48.058
He wants to talk to you.
He's holding on four.

28:48.093 --> 28:49.826
Okay, Rachel, listen.

28:49.861 --> 28:51.528
I cannot wait. I look forward,

28:51.563 --> 28:53.330
so look forward to fighting
with you about this later,

28:53.365 --> 28:54.765
but right now, I got to go.

28:54.800 --> 28:55.799
I got to go.

28:55.834 --> 28:57.400
I got... I got... I got...

28:57.435 --> 28:59.803
I got to go! What? Excuse me?

28:59.838 --> 29:01.037
Your valuable...
What about my valuable time?

29:01.073 --> 29:04.808
What about my valuable time
that I should not have to waste

29:04.843 --> 29:06.910
sitting here arguing with you
about the legal right

29:06.945 --> 29:09.012
to see my daughter?

29:09.047 --> 29:11.381
Ra...

29:12.284 --> 29:14.184
Hey, Makino?
(dial tone humming)

29:14.219 --> 29:15.819
Makino?

29:15.854 --> 29:17.821
He called.

29:17.856 --> 29:18.989
He was ready to talk.

29:19.024 --> 29:20.123
I didn't get
to the phone in time.

29:20.159 --> 29:21.992
He must have had second thoughts
and hung up the phone.

29:22.027 --> 29:23.493
By the time I got there,
he was gone.

29:23.528 --> 29:25.862
The one time in my life
I didn't hang up on my ex-wife.

29:25.897 --> 29:27.531
I could have
prevented this.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.332
Me. My fault. Come on.

29:29.367 --> 29:30.901
You don't know that.
No?

29:30.936 --> 29:32.502
Maybe the guy didn't get
second thoughts.

29:32.537 --> 29:33.770
Maybe that's
when they grabbed him.

29:33.805 --> 29:37.007
You don't know, and you can't
blame yourself for that, Danny.

29:37.042 --> 29:38.441
Come on.
You're a good cop.

29:38.476 --> 29:40.210
I'm a good cop?
Now I'm a good cop?

29:40.245 --> 29:42.846
You didn't want me around in
the first place. I'm a good cop.

29:42.881 --> 29:44.548
You're right. I didn't.

29:44.583 --> 29:47.918
I did not want to hire you,
but that's not because of you.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.019
I mean, there were
a lot of cops

29:49.054 --> 29:49.886
who'd been on the
force a long time

29:49.921 --> 29:51.288
in line to make detective.

29:51.323 --> 29:52.856
Then all of a sudden,

29:52.891 --> 29:55.292
I'm getting pressure
to hire a cop from

29:55.327 --> 29:57.060
(scoffs) the mainland

29:57.095 --> 30:00.397
who doesn't like Hawaii,
doesn't get along with anyone.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.999
I put in 29 years. I know
every cop in Hawaii, all right?

30:03.034 --> 30:04.501
Why do you think
I came here today?

30:04.536 --> 30:07.204
Because of your connection to the case?
(phone ringing)

30:07.239 --> 30:11.241
No. Because you are a good cop.

30:11.276 --> 30:13.877
Uh, th-the nurse's phone.

30:13.912 --> 30:15.078
You know, the fake one.

30:17.015 --> 30:18.915
Hello?

30:18.950 --> 30:20.383
We found your ambulance

30:20.418 --> 30:21.885
and we've got you surrounded.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.353
No one else has to get hurt.

30:23.388 --> 30:24.554
We just want Makino.

30:24.589 --> 30:27.891
And if you don't bring him out,

30:27.926 --> 30:29.559
we're gonna have to come in
and get him.

30:29.594 --> 30:31.061
All right.
Well, good luck with that.

30:31.096 --> 30:32.196
Come on.

30:35.934 --> 30:37.267
What's the plan?

30:37.302 --> 30:38.935
All right. I think
there's only three of them.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.403
We're gonna stay inside.
They want to come in,

30:40.438 --> 30:41.605
we'll pick them off
when they do.

30:41.640 --> 30:42.906
You get over
there with him.

30:42.941 --> 30:44.074
Head down, okay?

30:44.109 --> 30:45.942
Don't pick it up
for nothing.

30:45.977 --> 30:48.111
Hopefully my partner
gets here soon, okay?

30:48.947 --> 30:51.081
You all right?
- Yeah.

30:53.952 --> 30:54.985
(monitor beeping rapidly)

30:55.020 --> 30:56.119
They cut the power.

30:56.154 --> 30:57.487
JENNY:
The battery's dead.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.189
He's got three minutes
before he suffocates.

30:59.224 --> 31:01.225
Okay, so they want to wait
and see if he just dies.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.199
(engine revving)

31:14.105 --> 31:16.106
Saw a generator out there when
I was stashing the ambulance.

31:16.141 --> 31:17.207
I'm going for it.

31:17.242 --> 31:18.208
There's three
of them out there.

31:18.243 --> 31:20.176
Yeah. I don't want to
go out there, either,

31:20.211 --> 31:21.912
but I don't think
I have a choice.

31:21.947 --> 31:23.914
Without power, Makino will die.

31:23.949 --> 31:25.081
Williams?
Huh?

31:25.116 --> 31:26.683
I got your back.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.586
I wish that made me feel better.

the timely intervention.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.379

pretty bleak there.

33:36.414 --> 33:38.481
Uh-huh. DANNY: Don't, uh...
Don't-don't thank him.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.550
Just 'cause this could have
been an accident.

34:16.321 --> 34:18.822
Hey, so, I just spoke
to, uh, Steve.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.590
Dario Mendez-- they
got him on conspiracy.

34:20.625 --> 34:22.258
He's locked up now, so...

34:22.293 --> 34:24.194
He can still give orders
from behind bars.

34:24.229 --> 34:25.395
That's why we're
moving Makino tomorrow

34:25.430 --> 34:26.729
to the secure ward at King's.

34:26.764 --> 34:29.466
Ah. It's funny.

34:29.501 --> 34:31.601
The head of the Ochoa cartel
was so paranoid

34:31.636 --> 34:33.236
to think someone
who's been asleep

34:33.271 --> 34:36.139
for seven years is gonna
bring him down. (sighs)

34:36.174 --> 34:38.141
But in a way, he did.

34:38.176 --> 34:39.676
Yes, yes, I guess he did.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.111
Hmm.

34:41.146 --> 34:43.847
Well, it's been
quite a day.

34:43.882 --> 34:48.118
I'm not used to this much
action, so I am heading home.

34:48.153 --> 34:50.120
Hey, you did good today,
Captain, all right?

34:50.155 --> 34:52.555
Not bad for a retired cop?

34:52.590 --> 34:54.891
Oh, you know what? I was, I was,
uh... I was gonna ask you.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.493
How's, uh... how's that going?

34:56.528 --> 34:58.194
What, retirement?
Yeah.

34:58.229 --> 35:00.396
It's great. Why? You thinking
about hanging it up?

35:00.431 --> 35:02.165
I don't know. Maybe, you know?

35:02.200 --> 35:04.734
Well, I will tell you,
it will be Hawaii's loss,

35:04.769 --> 35:06.336
but, uh, you know, I mean,

35:06.371 --> 35:07.770
you've certainly earned it.

35:07.805 --> 35:09.906
But can I give you some advice?

35:09.941 --> 35:10.874
Oh, no, please.

35:10.909 --> 35:12.609
Have an exit plan.

35:12.644 --> 35:14.444
Um, find something you love,

35:14.479 --> 35:16.246
do that.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.615
And there's one other thing--
and you're gonna laugh--

35:18.650 --> 35:21.151
but whatever you do,
do not open a restaurant.

35:21.186 --> 35:22.085
Huh.

35:22.121 --> 35:25.221
I gave it a shot,
it went sideways so fast.

35:25.256 --> 35:26.523
One bad Yelp review,

35:26.558 --> 35:28.258

35:31.930 --> 35:34.164

35:49.948 --> 35:51.381

your eyes on the road.

35:58.489 --> 35:59.956

these guys a break.

Oh, no. Go ahead.
I'm... I'm finished.

want a Jell-O or something.

Hey, you, uh...

37:38.022 --> 37:39.389

you didn't know.

37:41.025 --> 37:42.659

Hey, that's what we do, right?

37:45.096 --> 37:47.797
I guess. Thank you.

you got to move tomorrow.

life to call me

in my life at the time.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.747
That had something
to do with it.

38:37.782 --> 38:39.382

38:39.417 --> 38:43.453
like, the backup
that I have now.

38:43.488 --> 38:44.921
You know?

38:44.956 --> 38:48.858
See, after-after
you disappeared, I, um...

38:48.893 --> 38:50.059
I, uh, joined a task force.

38:50.094 --> 38:53.529

I was drafted into service.

joined us, also. He, um...

39:11.516 --> 39:13.616

is dating my daughter,

39:13.651 --> 39:16.919

out here in the first place,

39:16.954 --> 39:19.555

39:29.634 --> 39:32.135
Oh, man, she was
a... she was a fox.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.137

crush on her,

39:34.172 --> 39:36.973
uh, when I first
met her, but, uh...

39:37.008 --> 39:39.609
And then there's the guy
who's, uh, in charge,

39:39.644 --> 39:44.480
um... who's a
bit of a putz.

39:44.515 --> 39:46.649
Big, gigantic pain
in my ass, you know.

<i>hate him every once in a while.</i>

I can get him to help you.
He'll listen to me.

40:09.474 --> 40:11.474
<i>Whatever these people want,</i>

don't give it to 'em.

<i>Don't you give it to 'em!</i>
(gunshot)

40:20.218 --> 40:21.651
(clattering)

40:23.688 --> 40:26.622
DANNY:<i> Anyway,</i>
<i>the-the point is that, um,</i>

40:26.657 --> 40:29.158
these are the people that, uh...

40:29.193 --> 40:31.461
that helped
save your life today.

40:31.496 --> 40:34.931
Uh, I guess Tanaka
and Jenny helped, also.

40:34.966 --> 40:37.500
But, uh, uh,
these people are my family.

40:37.535 --> 40:40.603
I'm-I'm saying that
it'd be nice... (sighs)

40:40.638 --> 40:43.806
if, uh... if you woke up, 'cause
you get to meet 'em, right?

40:43.841 --> 40:46.509
But yeah.

40:46.544 --> 40:48.511
'Cause, come to think of it,

40:48.546 --> 40:50.980
if it wasn't for you,
I never would've met them.

40:51.015 --> 40:55.117
And this, uh... this, uh, island

40:55.152 --> 40:57.954
never would have felt
like, uh-- ugh-- home.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.255
(laughs)

40:59.290 --> 41:01.557
Oh, yeah.

41:01.592 --> 41:02.758
Anyway, thank you.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.461
Thank you.

41:06.831 --> 41:08.898

41:08.933 --> 41:11.234

Hey. Who are you?

41:11.269 --> 41:14.237

Williams! Lieutenant Commander

41:14.272 --> 41:16.539

41:16.574 --> 41:18.908
No, you put your weapon down and
show me your I.D.! I'm Honolulu P.D.

41:18.943 --> 41:20.610
Put your weap... You show
