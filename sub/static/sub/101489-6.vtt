do you attend the funerals

13:36.120 --> 13:38.120
of your patients?

13:38.154 --> 13:40.887
Of course.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.554
It's the Christian thing to do.

13:43.587 --> 13:47.120
Well, someone has written me
and suggested

13:47.154 --> 13:50.620
that your behavior
at your last posting

13:50.654 --> 13:53.687
deserves further scrutiny.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.487
My behavior?
(short chuckle)

13:55.520 --> 13:56.987
For example,

13:57.020 --> 13:59.154
do you retain keepsakes

13:59.187 --> 14:01.120
from your patients?

14:01.154 --> 14:02.820
Those who've passed.

14:02.854 --> 14:04.554
I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.

14:04.587 --> 14:06.387
Because, of course,
it goes without saying

14:06.420 --> 14:08.920
that confiscating
the possessions of any patient

14:08.954 --> 14:10.654
is a crime.

14:10.687 --> 14:13.354
Dr. Harvard...

14:16.487 --> 14:18.687
...I can assure you
Oraetta Mayflower

14:18.720 --> 14:21.887
is a Christian citizen
of the highest character.

14:21.920 --> 14:25.554

spelling of the word "crime."

14:25.587 --> 14:27.120
May I see this letter
for myself?

14:29.154 --> 14:31.120
‐No.
‐Well...

14:32.854 --> 14:34.154
...may I at least

14:34.187 --> 14:37.354

14:42.020 --> 14:43.487

Watch your show.

33:48.052 --> 33:50.885
We'll go driving this weekend.

33:50.918 --> 33:53.752
‐What's the matter with you?
‐Nothing.

33:53.785 --> 33:55.818
I'm working.

34:04.052 --> 34:06.985
(whispers):
Holy Mother Mary.

34:09.918 --> 34:11.217
(speaks Italian)

34:12.918 --> 34:14.952
Don't wait up.

34:32.284 --> 34:34.918
(groaning)

34:34.952 --> 34:38.018
HARVARD:
I received a rather queer
letter about you today.

34:38.052 --> 34:40.752
ORAETTA:
About me?

34:40.784 --> 34:44.052
HARVARD:
Someone has written me and
suggested that your behavior

34:44.085 --> 34:46.284
at your last posting

34:46.318 --> 34:48.784
deserves further scrutiny.

34:48.818 --> 34:51.385
(continues groaning)

35:28.318 --> 35:30.285
Boss.

35:30.318 --> 35:32.285
Yeah.

35:32.318 --> 35:34.318
‐Goddamn it.
‐Here.

35:41.885 --> 35:44.718
You're back in the game.
Go see Ebal upstairs.

35:44.752 --> 35:48.252
‐He'll tell you where to go.
‐What about the kid?

35:48.285 --> 35:50.252
The kid's done.

35:51.918 --> 35:53.252
(engine starts)

36:10.152 --> 36:11.318
Kid!

36:14.052 --> 36:15.218
Kid!

36:23.452 --> 36:25.418
‐Where is he?
‐I...

36:25.452 --> 36:27.118
Where?!

36:27.152 --> 36:28.418
You're‐you're‐you...

36:28.452 --> 36:30.352
‐you're hurting me.
‐Where did they go?

36:30.385 --> 36:31.952
MAN:
Hey!

36:32.985 --> 36:34.385
Oh!
(whimpers)

36:36.118 --> 36:37.385
Where?

36:54.318 --> 36:56.352
(engine stops)

36:58.118 --> 37:00.652
Mister?

37:02.252 --> 37:03.852
Come on.

37:17.752 --> 37:19.885
The Americans,

37:19.918 --> 37:22.018
when they capture me,

37:22.052 --> 37:24.285
I was cooking my belt.

37:24.318 --> 37:26.352
SATCHEL:
Your belt?

37:26.385 --> 37:28.852
ANTOON:
I already eat my shoes.

37:30.452 --> 37:33.118
Monte Cassino.

37:33.152 --> 37:37.718
They send me here, to Kansas.

37:37.752 --> 37:40.652
Did you know they
bring war prisoners here?

37:42.385 --> 37:45.718
I think I was dead.

37:45.752 --> 37:48.385
A corpse, they shipped.

37:48.418 --> 37:51.085
A skeleton.

37:51.118 --> 37:54.418
It was the food, the smell,

37:54.452 --> 37:56.018
that bring me back.

37:56.052 --> 37:58.018
Fields of corn.

37:58.052 --> 38:01.752
Bread for every meal.

38:01.785 --> 38:03.952
Land of plenty.

38:03.985 --> 38:05.985
That's in the Constitution.

38:08.285 --> 38:11.118
Every day the sun come out.

38:11.152 --> 38:14.852
That big yellow American sun.

38:14.885 --> 38:17.752
It make me grow again,

38:17.785 --> 38:20.018
like a winter weed.

38:20.052 --> 38:21.752
And then,

38:21.785 --> 38:24.218
I am alive again.

38:24.252 --> 38:26.352
I took the blood oath,

38:26.385 --> 38:29.185
carve my name
on the stone there.

38:30.452 --> 38:33.952
"Antoon Dumini,

38:33.985 --> 38:35.352
American."

38:36.852 --> 38:39.952
This I would become.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.985
Go ahead, look.
Look.

39:05.385 --> 39:06.718
SATCHEL:
Cool.

39:23.185 --> 39:25.952
KIDS:
Daddy! Daddy!

39:25.985 --> 39:28.385
‐(singsongy): Daddy!
‐(kids chattering)

39:30.385 --> 39:32.352
GIRL:
I want to go for a drive.

39:35.252 --> 39:37.218
‐(gunshot)
‐(grunts)

39:41.418 --> 39:43.718
You hurt?

39:43.752 --> 39:45.352
No.

39:45.385 --> 39:48.918
I‐Is he dead?

39:51.052 --> 39:53.985
Yes.
Don't look away.

39:54.018 --> 39:57.852
This is what men do.
Snap out of it.

39:57.885 --> 39:59.818
We have to go.

40:00.852 --> 40:02.685
It's war now, for real.

40:02.718 --> 40:05.018
You're not safe here.

40:05.052 --> 40:06.985
Home?

40:08.018 --> 40:09.985
You're not safe there, either.

40:17.185 --> 40:18.852
You trust me?

40:25.185 --> 40:27.152
I never got to choose.

40:27.185 --> 40:29.752
A child soldier‐‐
that's what they made me.

40:29.785 --> 40:31.352
But that's not gonna
happen to you.

40:31.385 --> 40:32.952
Understand?

40:32.985 --> 40:35.152
I think so.

40:35.185 --> 40:37.718
So we're gonna
find someplace quiet,

40:37.752 --> 40:39.085
wait till the dust settles.

40:39.118 --> 40:41.085
And then,
if you want to go home‐‐

40:41.118 --> 40:43.018
if that's your choice‐‐

40:43.052 --> 40:45.852
I'll take you home.

40:45.885 --> 40:47.152
Understand?

40:47.185 --> 40:50.085
I'm scared.

40:52.452 --> 40:53.985
Me too.

41:13.918 --> 41:15.952
(man groaning)

41:37.252 --> 41:39.252
(groaning continuing)

41:46.052 --> 41:48.285
