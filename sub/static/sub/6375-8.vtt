WEBVTT

00:07.040 --> 00:10.007
This is gonna be a great cover.

00:10.087 --> 00:12.711
"Eye of the Fashion Storm"--
unique.

00:12.795 --> 00:15.630
Hey, Betty, you look like
someone who was good at science.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.636
Why do tornadoes always hit
shantytowns and trailer parks?

00:18.720 --> 00:20.625
Does god just hate
poor people?

00:20.667 --> 00:22.613
Amanda, I highly doubt that.

00:22.699 --> 00:24.603
But I gotta say,
I kind of feel

00:24.687 --> 00:27.945
like I'm in the middle
of a fashion storm right now.

00:28.031 --> 00:29.935
No. You look like
a plus-size princess.

00:30.019 --> 00:32.008
Dressing you up
in clothing from my hefty years

00:32.051 --> 00:34.040
is like playing
with a big squishy doll.

00:34.082 --> 00:37.224
It's so fun. Can we do it
again tomorrow, please?

00:37.225 --> 00:38.229
No, but you know

00:38.314 --> 00:41.023
is if the assistants got to go
on the editors' retreat, too.

00:41.108 --> 00:43.436
I mean, everyone from Meade

00:43.520 --> 00:45.763
out in the woods,
sharing ideas,

00:45.805 --> 00:48.259
telling anecdotes--
it sounds great.

00:48.302 --> 00:50.630
Great like herpes.

00:50.672 --> 00:53.888
Oh. Will you hold my bagel?
- Sure.

00:53.930 --> 00:55.792
Amanda!

00:57.824 --> 00:59.728
It's for your own good.

01:00.829 --> 01:02.395
Hey, Phil. It's Betty.

01:02.479 --> 01:05.822
Oh. Oh, that's too bad.

01:05.908 --> 01:08.743
I guess I'll let Daniel know.

01:10.858 --> 01:12.890
Daniel, Phil just called.

01:12.975 --> 01:14.879
There's a problem
at the printer,

01:14.921 --> 01:16.360
so the fashion storm issue

01:16.402 --> 01:18.350
won't arrive at the loading dock
till noon,

01:18.434 --> 01:20.296
which means we have to push
your final approval.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.116
Oh, that sucks.

01:22.158 --> 01:25.332
I wanted to ride
up to the retreat with Connor.

01:25.374 --> 01:27.406
That was supposed
to be the fun car. Ugh.

01:27.448 --> 01:30.283
Well, here's a thought,
just, you know, out of the blue.

01:30.369 --> 01:32.230
What if <i>you</i>
go ahead with Connor

01:32.315 --> 01:34.346
and let <i>me</i>
do the final approval

01:34.431 --> 01:36.336
right before
the issue goes out?

01:36.377 --> 01:39.213
I don't know. I mean...
If there's any problems,

01:39.255 --> 01:41.456
That's the last chance
to catch them.

01:41.541 --> 01:44.546
I don't think you really want
that kind of responsibility.

01:44.630 --> 01:46.365
Uh. Yeah, I do.

01:46.408 --> 01:49.285
Daniel, I've watched you do it,
like, a million times,

01:49.370 --> 01:51.317
I totally know
what to look for,

01:51.402 --> 01:53.475
and besides, while you guys
are at your retreat,

01:53.517 --> 01:54.658
I really want to be helpful.

01:54.659 --> 01:56.777
I guess you are kind of
O.C.D. about things, right?

01:56.861 --> 01:58.723
I prefer the word "careful."

02:02.109 --> 02:04.182
All right. You know what?

02:04.267 --> 02:05.706
Go for it.

02:05.790 --> 02:07.187
Really?
- Mm-hmm.

02:07.229 --> 02:08.710
Thank you!

02:08.752 --> 02:11.080
Aah!
You won't be disappointed.

02:13.112 --> 02:14.974
That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

02:15.016 --> 02:17.005
I need your budget
right away. Excuse me.

02:17.048 --> 02:18.571
Sorry, mate.
Hold the lift.

02:18.613 --> 02:21.152
Wilhelmina.

02:21.237 --> 02:22.294
Good morning, Connor.

02:22.295 --> 02:24.961
So are you ready for our
little trek into the woods?

02:25.004 --> 02:26.443
Ugh. Absolutely not.

02:26.527 --> 02:28.940
I find these retreats
a colossal waste of time.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.929
Oh. Well, that's
an important perspective

02:30.971 --> 02:33.426
that we all need to hear.

02:33.467 --> 02:36.514
So you're going,
and that's an order.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.181
Uh, an order?

02:39.224 --> 02:42.609
Connor, you do realize
you work for me?

02:42.651 --> 02:44.683
Yes, my queen.

02:44.767 --> 02:47.899
and heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

02:47.983 --> 02:50.057
Still...

02:50.142 --> 02:52.046
it's the price of leadership.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.781
I'll see you there, boss.

02:57.082 --> 03:00.425
Okay, bridezilla,
let's discuss your wedding.

03:00.511 --> 03:03.049
Mm, nah.
Let's talk about your hair.

03:03.092 --> 03:05.716
Ooh.
- It's looking a little frizzy today.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.255
What? Oh, my god. Fix it.
- Sit.

03:08.340 --> 03:11.175
I thought the red lip,
the updo was the right choice.

03:11.217 --> 03:14.011
Wait. You're distracting me.
Marc, you proposed to Cliff,

03:14.095 --> 03:16.507
Which I have to say, I thought
was a little weird considering

03:16.592 --> 03:19.047
that you were so freaked out
about moving in with him,

03:19.131 --> 03:21.840
and now you never want
to talk about it.

03:21.882 --> 03:23.913
Ah. That--that is not true.

03:23.956 --> 03:26.241
Well, every time
I bring up the wedding,

03:26.283 --> 03:27.294
you change the subject.

03:27.295 --> 03:29.669
Hey, what are we gonna do
while the editors are gone?

03:29.711 --> 03:31.895
The usual--make the temps
kiss each other?

03:31.896 --> 03:32.758
That is really fun.

03:32.843 --> 03:34.832
Mm.
- Wait, no. You're doing it again.

03:34.916 --> 03:36.567
Marc, are you punishing me

03:36.610 --> 03:39.106
because I said I don't approve
of gay marriage?

03:39.149 --> 03:41.053
I only meant that
for unattractive gays,

03:41.137 --> 03:44.058
and Cliff is really growing on me.
Marc.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.005
Ooh. Gotta go.
Thank God.

03:46.089 --> 03:47.020
Marc!

03:47.105 --> 03:48.036
Yes?

03:48.120 --> 03:50.152
Aah! Gun!

03:50.237 --> 03:52.395
It's for the retreat.

03:52.479 --> 03:54.764
Connor's making me go.

03:54.807 --> 03:56.246
He's enraging.

03:56.331 --> 03:58.320
He's so self-confident,

03:58.404 --> 04:00.859
he won't listen
to a word I say

04:00.944 --> 04:03.822
and he's not afraid of me.
- I am. I'm afraid of you.

04:03.906 --> 04:05.769
Oh, stop your cowering, Marc.

04:05.853 --> 04:07.799
I don't even need a gun
with you.

04:07.884 --> 04:11.439
Five good words, and I could
make you pee in your pants.

04:11.524 --> 04:14.613
So Connor's really
getting under your skin, huh?

04:14.698 --> 04:16.940
Is it that obvious?

04:16.983 --> 04:19.987
Oh, it's no use, Marc.

04:20.029 --> 04:21.680
He's unavailable.

04:21.721 --> 04:23.161
He has a fiancée,

04:23.204 --> 04:28.621
and I'm sure she's 20-something,
fabulous, European and thin.

04:28.664 --> 04:31.245
Well,
you're all those things, too.

04:31.329 --> 04:34.207
Okay, so I will
make sure that your room

04:34.292 --> 04:37.804
is on the opposite side
of the lodge from Connor's.

04:37.889 --> 04:40.894
Good. Thank God
it's hunting season.

04:40.979 --> 04:43.348
If I can't be
with the man I want,

04:43.434 --> 04:45.380
at least I can kill something.

04:53.759 --> 04:56.256
What the...

04:57.991 --> 04:59.599
Hmm.

04:59.642 --> 05:02.477
You know, the binding adhesive
has a really strong smell.

05:02.562 --> 05:04.805
I'm afraid it's gonna overpower
the perfume samples.

05:04.847 --> 05:07.598
Oh, jeez. That would
be a disaster, huh?

05:07.682 --> 05:10.010
Here's what I'll do--

05:10.095 --> 05:12.888
I'm gonna have my guys
rip all these pallets apart,

05:12.973 --> 05:15.215
we'll take the magazines
back to the printer,

05:15.301 --> 05:17.798
then we'll manufacture
an odorless adhesive

05:17.882 --> 05:19.913
and we'll rebind them.

05:19.956 --> 05:22.452
Now I know it's probably
gonna cost a few hundred grand,

05:22.495 --> 05:25.372
but I want you to be happy
because you have final approval.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.362
Fine. They can go out as is.

05:27.404 --> 05:30.451
All right, boys, ship 'em.

05:30.536 --> 05:33.371
Oh, hey. Could you
take a picture for me?

05:35.106 --> 05:37.264
Fine. I'll do it myself.

05:39.253 --> 05:40.777
"Eye of the Fashion Storm"--

05:40.861 --> 05:43.105
First "Mode" issue
approved by me!

05:44.797 --> 05:46.618
Welcome, everyone,

05:46.702 --> 05:48.564
to Meade's annual
editors' retreat.

05:48.649 --> 05:51.188
Without further ado,
let me turn things over

05:51.273 --> 05:53.177
to the newest member
of our team--

05:53.262 --> 05:56.689
C.F.O. of Meade publications,
Connor Owens.

05:59.694 --> 06:02.699
Thank you, everyone.
I'm thrilled to be joining,

06:02.784 --> 06:06.084
but before the fun begins,
some sobering facts.

06:06.170 --> 06:09.131
This is not a happy time
for the magazine industry.

06:09.217 --> 06:11.163
Fewer readers
plus more competition

06:11.248 --> 06:14.210
equals far, far less money.

06:14.295 --> 06:16.241
If we can't come up
with innovative ways...

06:16.326 --> 06:18.696
to cut costs
and increase revenues,

06:18.781 --> 06:21.320
Meade may have to take
drastic steps.

06:21.405 --> 06:24.283
Some of you may find
your magazines shut down.

06:24.367 --> 06:28.092
The next few hours that were
scheduled as personal time

06:28.176 --> 06:31.096
will now be a walk in the woods,
some time with your thoughts.

06:31.180 --> 06:34.016
Bring me bold ideas.

06:34.101 --> 06:37.190
I don't care how silly
or far out they may seem to you.

06:37.275 --> 06:38.672
That crazy idea

06:38.713 --> 06:41.972
may just be the one
that saves your magazine.

06:42.057 --> 06:46.628
Uh, excuse me. May I offer
a crazy suggestion right now?

06:46.712 --> 06:48.151
Of course.

06:48.193 --> 06:52.214
Take everyone's phones
and P.D.A.s.

06:52.249 --> 06:54.711
What?

06:54.753 --> 06:58.350
You really want people to focus?
Cut off all distractions.

06:58.435 --> 07:00.932
Great idea.

07:01.016 --> 07:03.047
Well, I don't think so.
- I do.

07:03.133 --> 07:05.925
I mean, going off the grid--
I-I like the way that sounds.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.804
All right, people.

07:08.888 --> 07:11.851
Hand 'em over.
On the table right now.

07:11.935 --> 07:13.882
Oh, Claire,
just so you know,

07:13.966 --> 07:15.871
I'm going hunting
later on today.

07:15.955 --> 07:19.172
Feel free to walk
front of my gun.

07:19.256 --> 07:21.711
Good news, everybody!

07:21.753 --> 07:23.658
The final approval is done.

07:23.743 --> 07:26.282
I was a little worried
about the smell,

07:26.366 --> 07:29.329
but I think it's gonna be okay.
The issue has shipped!

07:29.371 --> 07:33.857
You e-mailed us all a picture.
- I tried to get your mustache

07:33.899 --> 07:35.719
<i> We have breaking news</i>
<i>to report.</i>

07:35.762 --> 07:38.131
<i>A tornado is currently</i>
<i>cutting a path of destruction</i>

07:38.174 --> 07:40.121
<i>through central Kansas.</i>

07:40.162 --> 07:42.744

07:48.034 --> 07:50.446
That kind of looks like the cover.
<i>...Deaths have been reported</i>

07:52.859 --> 07:57.218

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:20.985 --> 08:23.905
Phil! Phil.

08:23.947 --> 08:26.445
We can't ship the magazine.
Huge emergency.

08:26.486 --> 08:29.237
Oh, let me guess.
The pages are too glossy.

08:29.322 --> 08:31.268
Well, yes, a little, but no.

08:31.354 --> 08:34.570
There is a huge awful tornado
destroying Kansas. Look.

08:34.654 --> 08:37.361
Tornado on the cover.
Tornado on the TV.

08:37.448 --> 08:39.097
Get it?

08:39.140 --> 08:41.679
This is gonna be
a huge P.R. disaster.

08:41.764 --> 08:45.065
All right, you listen to me.
It was really cute before

08:45.108 --> 08:47.139
when you came
in with the final approval

08:47.223 --> 08:49.847
and then you took the picture
remember that? It was very cute.

08:49.932 --> 08:53.571
But the truth is, you have no authority.
What? What?

08:53.656 --> 08:55.899
Look,
they put me in charge here.

08:55.941 --> 08:59.369
I am the point person,
so stop shipping the issue.

08:59.454 --> 09:02.121
That's an... order?

09:02.205 --> 09:04.956
Listen, pointy, the only
two people with real authority

09:05.040 --> 09:07.198
are Daniel Meade
and Wilhelmina Slater,

09:07.283 --> 09:10.330
And if I don't hear from either
one of them, the issue ships.

09:10.415 --> 09:13.462
Phil, I've been trying
to get ahold of them,

09:13.547 --> 09:15.875
but I can't get through.

09:15.916 --> 09:18.963
Look, I begged Daniel
for this responsibility.

09:19.049 --> 09:19.343
Ugh.

09:19.344 --> 09:22.730
And I promised him that
nothing would go wrong.

09:22.815 --> 09:25.607
So please... help me.

09:25.693 --> 09:28.147
All right, look.
The only thing I can do for you

09:28.231 --> 09:30.603
is I can hold off
for four hours, all right?

09:30.604 --> 09:30.814
Huh.

09:30.855 --> 09:33.733
And if I don't hear
from either one of them by then,

09:33.818 --> 09:35.764
The issue goes out. Sorry.

09:35.850 --> 09:37.881
Okay! Thank you!
- Whatever!

09:45.837 --> 09:48.080
Here it is!

09:48.165 --> 09:50.931
The permit from the city for my salon.

09:50.932 --> 09:51.085
Oh.

09:51.127 --> 09:53.793
Okay,
"commercial variances

09:53.836 --> 09:56.544
are prohibited
in residential districts."

09:56.628 --> 09:58.956
Yeah, but where's my permit?

09:59.041 --> 10:03.019
<i>Mija,</i> I think this means
your permit is denied.

10:03.104 --> 10:05.305
What?

10:05.346 --> 10:09.029
Do you know how hard
I work for this?

10:09.071 --> 10:11.271
You know whose fault this is?

10:11.356 --> 10:13.980
Archie "the rat" Rodriguez.

10:14.064 --> 10:17.662
Mr. Slick-ass City Councilman
comes over here,

10:17.704 --> 10:20.243
and he's all like, "you need to
apply for your permit legally."

10:20.328 --> 10:22.402
Look where it's gotten me.
He should be impeached.

10:22.444 --> 10:24.475
Yeah.
- I'm sorry, sweetie.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.064
Oh, man!

10:25.065 --> 10:27.522
You should just
open the salon anyway.

10:27.607 --> 10:30.696
No, she shouldn't.
It's breaking the law.

10:30.739 --> 10:33.574
What are they gonna do,
put undercover hair police

10:33.616 --> 10:36.156
across the street
to watch our house?

10:36.240 --> 10:37.975
Honey, <i>papi's</i> right.

10:38.018 --> 10:39.541
Bye.

10:39.626 --> 10:42.884
We can't risk getting caught.

10:44.493 --> 10:46.313
<i>Bold ideas. Bold ideas.</i>

10:46.355 --> 10:48.302
<i>Isn't that</i>
<i>what we pay Connor for?</i>

10:48.386 --> 10:51.137
<i>Okay, think, Daniel. Think.</i>
<i>I'm empty.</i>

10:51.222 --> 10:53.127
<i>What if I never have</i>
<i>another idea?</i>

10:53.211 --> 10:56.131
<i>I wonder what happened to</i>
<i>Jenny August from Andover.</i>

10:56.174 --> 10:58.289
<i>She had pretty hair,</i>
<i>really good penmanship.</i>

10:58.373 --> 10:59.982
Aah!
- Whoa!

11:00.067 --> 11:01.506
Oh!

11:01.590 --> 11:03.029
Sorry.

11:03.114 --> 11:05.569
Are you okay?
- Yeah. No, my ankle.

11:05.653 --> 11:06.922
Ahh. You?

11:07.007 --> 11:09.081
Yeah, fine.
Don't worry about me.

11:09.166 --> 11:12.297
Do you think it's broken?
- Well, I'm not a doctor, but...

11:12.382 --> 11:13.313
Really?

11:13.398 --> 11:15.556
What? I could be a doctor.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.502
Is it so obvious I'm not?

11:17.587 --> 11:20.465
What are the odds I fall
out of a tree and hit a doctor?

11:20.549 --> 11:22.539
Point taken.

11:22.581 --> 11:25.078
Aren't you a little grown-up
to be climbing trees?

11:25.120 --> 11:27.532
That's exactly
why I was doing it.

11:27.618 --> 11:30.029
People are always saying
you're too old to do stuff.

11:30.072 --> 11:32.441
You know what?

11:32.527 --> 11:34.600
I agree with you.

11:34.642 --> 11:36.463
He me up. Let me see
if I can bear weight.

11:36.547 --> 11:37.478
Okay.

11:37.520 --> 11:38.917
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

11:39.001 --> 11:41.709
Ow! Okay.

11:41.795 --> 11:44.883
All right. Ow!

11:54.067 --> 11:56.352
Come to mama.

11:59.485 --> 12:02.955
You're welcome
to take the first shot.

12:03.039 --> 12:06.679
Too easy. Aren't you
supposed to be thinking?

12:06.764 --> 12:09.387
Oh, this is actually
where I get my best ideas.

12:09.472 --> 12:11.969
There's something
so primal about it.

12:12.011 --> 12:14.592
Very few things in life
make you feel this way.

12:14.677 --> 12:17.005
I could think of a couple.

12:17.089 --> 12:19.756
Yeah, me, too.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.745
Well,
should we do this together?

12:24.538 --> 12:26.527
Dani.

12:26.612 --> 12:29.235
Ugh. Hilda, I can't
really talk right now.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.071
I'm trying
to get ahold of Daniel,

12:32.155 --> 12:33.670
And I'm in the middle
of a work crisis.

12:33.671 --> 12:35.033
Me, too. Listen, where'd you put the

12:35.075 --> 12:36.811
hat you bought during your ugly hat phase?

12:36.896 --> 12:39.223
My what? I didn't have
an ugly hat phase.

12:39.308 --> 12:42.101
Oh, right.
Just your hat phase.

12:42.185 --> 12:44.217
Okay, uh, why do you
need this right now?

12:44.259 --> 12:47.644
Because I have come up with
a way to keep the salon open.

12:47.730 --> 12:49.676
They denied my permit,

12:49.761 --> 12:52.892
so i'm opening an underground
styling speakeasy.

12:52.977 --> 12:55.093
All cash,
entrance in the back.

12:55.177 --> 12:58.098
Okay, I don't really have time
to focus on this right now,

12:58.183 --> 13:00.283
but it already sounds
like a bad idea.

13:00.284 --> 13:01.737
What are you talking about?

13:01.822 --> 13:04.022
People love a sense of danger.
- With their haircuts?

13:04.065 --> 13:06.519
I-I found them.
Thank you. Never mind. Bye.

13:10.455 --> 13:12.402
I smell pluck.

13:12.487 --> 13:13.246
Where are you going?

13:13.247 --> 13:14.688
I can't just sit
here and do nothing.

13:14.772 --> 13:16.803
Daniel is not answering
his cell phone,

13:16.888 --> 13:18.793
and the lodge is
under strict instructions

13:18.877 --> 13:21.628
not let any calls in or out
for the next few hours.

13:21.712 --> 13:24.591
Yes, I know. Wilhelmina managed
to get a text off to me

13:24.675 --> 13:26.811
before they took away
all their cell phones.

13:26.812 --> 13:28.188
Oh. Well, I'm going up there.

13:28.229 --> 13:31.869
So I raided the petty cash
drawer, and I'm taking a cab.

13:31.954 --> 13:33.604
I've underestimated you.

13:33.647 --> 13:36.398
I was thinking this was
all out poor, homely Betty

13:36.482 --> 13:38.386
worrying about the poor,
homely people of Kansas,

13:38.472 --> 13:40.799
But no, no, no, no.
This is about your career.

13:40.884 --> 13:42.872
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

13:42.958 --> 13:44.862
You think that if you get
the news to Daniel,

13:44.946 --> 13:46.893
you'll come up smelling
like a <i>she-ro.</i>

13:46.978 --> 13:49.813
Ugh. Marc, I don't care
what I smell like.

13:49.898 --> 13:50.279
Mm, right.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.802
I promised Daniel
nothing would go wrong,

13:51.887 --> 13:54.807
so I don't really have a choice.
- Well, then I'm going with you.

13:54.850 --> 13:57.786
You think I'm just gonna sit
here and watch you outshine me?

13:57.787 --> 13:58.700
Fine. Whatever, Marc.

13:58.743 --> 14:00.732
First of all,
I'm not taking a <i>cab</i>

14:00.774 --> 14:02.552
all the way to Talmadge Hall.

14:02.636 --> 14:05.514
All righty then, Marc.
How do you want to get there,

14:05.599 --> 14:06.293
your wings?

14:06.294 --> 14:09.323
Cliff's away till tomorrow.
We'll take his car.

14:09.407 --> 14:10.762
Road trip?

14:10.804 --> 14:12.285
Shotgun!

14:16.179 --> 14:19.057
<i> With new tornadoes</i>
<i>touching down all over Kansas,</i>

14:19.098 --> 14:21.638
<i>it will be morning</i>
<i>until we know the full extent</i>

14:21.722 --> 14:23.627
<i>of the damage</i>
<i>of this powerful system...</i>

14:23.712 --> 14:26.420
Oh, god. Marc, can you
<i>please</i> pick up the pace?

14:26.505 --> 14:27.902
Easy does-y, fuzzy wuzzy.

14:27.986 --> 14:29.721
You're gonna give yourself
worry lines,

14:29.806 --> 14:32.853
not that anyone could see them
under that canopy of bangs.

14:32.938 --> 14:35.138
The issue ships in two hours,

14:35.180 --> 14:37.702
and we are still 100 Miles
from the lodge.

14:37.703 --> 14:38.523
And constantly

14:38.566 --> 14:40.513
with the latest tornado
updates

14:40.555 --> 14:42.580
is not gonna get us
there any faster.

14:42.581 --> 14:43.433
Well, I'm sorry.

14:43.475 --> 14:46.099
You know what? I'm right here.
- I can't just sit back...

14:46.142 --> 14:48.342
You don't have to scream in my ear.
- and watch my magazine--

14:48.427 --> 14:50.839
Ladies, <i>chillax.</i> I know
how we can pass the time.

14:50.881 --> 14:52.870
Let's talk about Marc's wedding.
- No.

14:52.913 --> 14:53.821
You're getting married?

14:53.822 --> 14:55.875
I have a better idea.
Let's talk about Amanda's hair.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.668
Wow. Still frizzy.
- What? I am not falling for that again.

14:58.753 --> 15:01.588
Marc, I came on this trip
to talk about your wedding,

15:01.673 --> 15:04.508
and that I what we're gonna do.
- Marc, I can't believe

15:04.594 --> 15:06.793
if I was getting married,

15:06.879 --> 15:08.730
I would never stop talking
about my wedding.

15:08.731 --> 15:09.840
- And we'd all kill ourselves

15:09.883 --> 15:11.266
so does that mean
there will be two best men?

15:11.267 --> 15:12.168
I'm still the Maid of honor...

15:12.211 --> 15:13.109
- That's offensive.

15:13.110 --> 15:15.046
- 'cause I already
bought a fuchsia dress.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.559
I didn't mean it to be.
I'm totally for gay marriage.

15:17.560 --> 15:18.474
It's a really cute--

15:18.516 --> 15:20.294
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.071
Let's just listen to music quietly.
<i> # amazing Grace #</i>

15:22.156 --> 15:24.103
Oh, good. Christian radio, my favorite.
<i># how sweet #</i>

15:24.187 --> 15:26.938
Watch out for that stuff.
It'll make you itch like crazy.

15:27.023 --> 15:28.462
Oh, I'm immune.

15:29.985 --> 15:30.916
Shh.

15:31.001 --> 15:32.863
Sounds like a big one.

15:32.948 --> 15:35.613
8-pointer, maybe.

15:38.999 --> 15:41.116
Ugh. False alarm again.

15:41.158 --> 15:44.205
Would it be too much to ask
for something with antlers?

15:44.290 --> 15:45.729
What is it?

15:45.770 --> 15:48.860
It's, uh, Daniel
and some cripply wood nymph.

15:48.945 --> 15:51.230
It's your form of rebellion.

15:52.712 --> 15:56.309
That's my fiancée Molly.

15:56.393 --> 15:57.789
That's her?

15:57.874 --> 15:59.948
You sound surprised.

15:59.990 --> 16:03.715
Well, it's just that he's...
wonderfully ordinary.

16:03.756 --> 16:06.507
Why is she limping?

16:06.592 --> 16:08.962
All right, it's not much further now.
- Okay.

16:09.047 --> 16:10.952
So you don't work at Meade?

16:10.993 --> 16:12.940
No, but I'm here
with someone who does.

16:13.025 --> 16:14.506
Oh. Who?

16:14.549 --> 16:16.368
Molly.

16:18.272 --> 16:21.150
Well, I see you two
finally met.

16:21.235 --> 16:24.156
What have you done?
- I twisted my ankle. It's a long story.

16:24.197 --> 16:26.956
Oh, let me.
Can you grab that, mate?

16:26.957 --> 16:27.329
Yeah.

16:27.414 --> 16:30.291
Ooh. Okay.

16:38.756 --> 16:40.998
We only have an hour and 27--

16:41.083 --> 16:43.115
Oh!--26 minutes left.

16:43.156 --> 16:44.511
We are currently traveling

16:44.596 --> 16:46.542
at the speed
of 50 Miles an hour,

16:46.585 --> 16:49.759
and I think that if we push it
at least up to the speed limit,

16:49.802 --> 16:52.594
we could give ourselves a cushion.
- Hey, Betty, you know what?

16:52.637 --> 16:55.557
Now might be a really good time
for some stress eating.

16:55.641 --> 16:58.561
I'm sure Cliff is
a food stasher. Ugh.

16:59.396 --> 17:02.032
- What? What? What? What is it?

17:02.117 --> 17:03.809
Nothing.
- You squealed.

17:03.852 --> 17:05.798
No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

17:05.840 --> 17:07.279
No, I didn't.
- Yes. You did.

17:07.364 --> 17:09.057
No, I didn't.
- Betty?

17:09.141 --> 17:09.897
You kinda did.

17:09.898 --> 17:12.061
Okay, fine. Do you
really want to know?

17:12.104 --> 17:14.674
I found a receipt from Tiffany's
for two wedding rings.

17:14.675 --> 17:15.362
Oh!

17:15.448 --> 17:16.387
Oh. Oh.

17:16.388 --> 17:18.790
Cliff got you a ring!
Oh! Oh, that's so cute!

17:18.875 --> 17:20.271
Oh, my god.
- That's so sweet.

17:20.357 --> 17:22.261
Let me see it...
- No, Marc...

17:22.303 --> 17:24.207
Marc! Marc, the wheel!

17:27.962 --> 17:30.543
What have I done?
- You crashed Cliff's car.

17:30.586 --> 17:33.167
How's he ever gonna be able
to trust me again?

17:33.252 --> 17:35.622
Um, you get it fixed.
It's just a car.

17:35.664 --> 17:38.584
And it's an ugly car,
so you kind of did him a favor.

17:38.669 --> 17:40.997
55 minutes? All right, thanks.

17:41.081 --> 17:42.943
Guys, we can't wait
for the tow truck.

17:43.028 --> 17:45.906
We'll never make it on time.
Amanda, help me push.

17:45.990 --> 17:48.656
Uh, no. These stilettos
were not meant for pushing.

17:48.699 --> 17:51.746
Although, maybe they were meant
for something else.

17:53.100 --> 17:54.751
Unh!

17:54.793 --> 17:56.613
Wait, wait.

17:56.655 --> 17:59.956
Wait. I wasn't ready.
- If we get back to the city by 5:00,

18:00.040 --> 18:01.987
We can all get completely drunk

18:02.072 --> 18:04.230
And pretend like none of this
ever happened.

18:04.231 --> 18:04.949
Okay, here's...

18:05.034 --> 18:07.996
I saw a store back that way.
Marc, you stay here.

18:08.081 --> 18:10.668
Amanda, come with me.
We'll ask someone for a ride.

18:10.669 --> 18:11.763
- These stilettos are...

18:11.848 --> 18:14.387
Okay, I'm going by myself.
Whatever.

18:14.429 --> 18:17.307
Betty, could you grab me
some beef jerky?

18:17.392 --> 18:19.720
Thanks!

18:23.062 --> 18:25.094
I got the horse right here.

18:25.136 --> 18:28.606
His name is Paul Revere.

18:30.384 --> 18:33.092
Are you a cop? Because you
gotta say if you are.

18:33.135 --> 18:35.759
I'm just here
to get my roots done.

18:35.801 --> 18:37.790
Julie, you look so good, right?
- Yeah.

18:37.833 --> 18:41.345
I added some extra layers for fullness.
- I love it. It's perfect.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.292
Oh, good. I'm so glad.

18:43.376 --> 18:45.450
Now just remember
what it looks like.

18:45.493 --> 18:49.004
Oh, and don't take that off
until you're around the corner.

18:49.090 --> 18:51.628
Hey. Da-da-da.
You gotta go out the back.

18:51.714 --> 18:54.930
And if anyone asks, you were
here looking for your cat.

18:54.972 --> 18:56.792
Bye.
- Hello.

18:56.876 --> 18:58.950
Hey! Oh, you waited too long.

18:58.993 --> 19:00.812
I know. I know.

19:00.855 --> 19:02.759
Okay.

19:02.844 --> 19:05.595
<i>Papi.</i>
Why aren't you at work?

19:05.637 --> 19:07.753
They're bombing for roaches.

19:07.795 --> 19:09.700
So this is your solution?

19:09.784 --> 19:11.180
Breaking the law?

19:11.266 --> 19:14.101
Excuse me. look,
I tried to do it legally.

19:14.186 --> 19:15.328
I applied for a permit
and look what happened.

19:15.364 --> 19:16.471
I got rejected.
So why take no for an answer?

19:32.299 --> 19:34.711
Oh.

19:34.753 --> 19:36.954
Oh, good.

19:37.038 --> 19:39.789
Hello.

19:39.832 --> 19:41.736
Good day. How are you?

19:41.821 --> 19:44.191
Um, I have
a very strange request.

19:44.232 --> 19:46.180
I was wondering if you could

19:46.222 --> 19:48.634
MAYBE give me a ride
to Talmadge Hall.

19:48.718 --> 19:51.765
I could pay you, uh...

19:53.247 --> 19:55.364
and 10, 15, 16, 17...

19:55.405 --> 19:57.310
18 dollars.

19:57.395 --> 19:59.341
Lady, I'd love to drive you,

19:59.426 --> 20:01.288
but the government don't want me
behind the wheel

20:01.372 --> 20:02.727
after that third D.W.I.

20:02.811 --> 20:04.716
<i>#...Hempstead after dark #</i>

20:04.801 --> 20:06.705
Oh. Mm! Okay.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.991
Uh, well, is there
anyone else around here

20:09.075 --> 20:10.937
who maybe doesn't have
those issues?

20:11.022 --> 20:12.461
No judgment.

20:12.502 --> 20:16.227
<i># so put me on a highway #</i>

20:17.750 --> 20:20.544
Right. Okay.

20:20.628 --> 20:24.480
Well, then I guess I'll just
take a couple of these for now.

20:24.521 --> 20:28.119
Hey. What the...

20:28.204 --> 20:34.340
<i># yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah #</i>

20:34.425 --> 20:36.413
Here you go.

20:36.499 --> 20:38.614
Wait. Let me see that.

20:43.566 --> 20:46.063
Do you have a phone book?

20:48.475 --> 20:50.422
So I'm torn.

20:50.506 --> 20:52.664
Much as I like to see
Wilhelmina suffer,

20:52.750 --> 20:54.950
I'm kind of ready
to strangle someone

20:54.992 --> 20:56.939
if I don't get my phone back.

20:57.024 --> 20:59.563
You and everyone else here.

20:59.648 --> 21:03.033
So how was
your walk in the woods?

21:03.118 --> 21:04.810
Any revelations?

21:04.853 --> 21:07.519
No, not really
a business one.

21:07.604 --> 21:09.381
Mm. Romantic?

21:09.424 --> 21:11.286
At makes you say that?

21:11.370 --> 21:13.698
Because you look like
a boy with a crush

21:13.783 --> 21:17.337
and some sort of crud
on your face.

21:17.422 --> 21:19.369
Mom, okay,
maybe a little crush,

21:19.411 --> 21:21.908
but she's taken,
so what's the point?

21:21.993 --> 21:25.209
Her name wouldn't be Betty,
would it?

21:25.294 --> 21:26.225
What?

21:26.309 --> 21:27.537
No! No!

21:35.535 --> 21:40.445
Looks like we're getting
our phones back.

21:40.529 --> 21:44.126
Thank you so much, Daniel.

21:44.211 --> 21:45.734
I really appreciate that.

21:45.819 --> 21:47.555
Betty, this is teriyaki.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.840
No, I really mean it.
You went way above

21:49.924 --> 21:51.871
and beyond the call of duty,
Betty.

21:51.955 --> 21:55.722
Skywriting-- way to think on your feet.
- Well, you put me in charge,

21:55.807 --> 21:58.599
and I didn't
want to disappoint you,

21:58.685 --> 22:01.223
So I used your credit card
number and voilà!

22:01.266 --> 22:02.747
Oh, just curious.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.625
Uh, how much does
skywriting cost anyway?

22:05.709 --> 22:09.391
Um, let's just say a lot less
than a massive P.R. nightmare.

22:09.476 --> 22:12.396
Not that our problems even
compare to the tornado victims'.

22:12.439 --> 22:15.274
Right. I'm gonna call Phil down
at the loading dock right now.

22:15.359 --> 22:17.094
Great.

22:18.913 --> 22:21.621
Well, you'll be happy to know
this retreat's gonna end early

22:21.707 --> 22:23.569
so we can deal
with this whole thing.

22:23.653 --> 22:26.573
We're gonna have to figure out
a whole new cover,

22:26.616 --> 22:29.536
eat the cost of the old one.
Do we?

22:29.620 --> 22:32.371
Before you make that call,
why don't we have a little chat?

22:40.427 --> 22:43.856
Okay, one plate of "Betty saved
the magazine" pancakes.

22:43.897 --> 22:45.464
Mmm!
- Mmm!

22:45.591 --> 22:46.235
What's in them?

22:46.236 --> 22:48.468
Actually, just regular
pancakes with whipped cream.

22:48.511 --> 22:51.473
You didn't give me a lot of time.
- Mm.

22:51.515 --> 22:54.436
You know, using a skywriter to
send a message--let me tell you,

22:54.520 --> 22:57.356
that's the stuff people remember you for.
- I don't know.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.148
I'm just glad I got a chance
to show them

23:00.191 --> 23:02.603
I can handle a little responsibility.
Aunt Betty!

23:02.688 --> 23:02.995
Hmm?

23:02.996 --> 23:06.369
Talk about being
ripped from the headlines.

23:06.412 --> 23:08.909
"Eye of the Fashion Storm"?

23:08.952 --> 23:10.814
Where did you get that?
- The newsstands.

23:10.898 --> 23:12.633
Oh, no.

23:12.676 --> 23:16.992
<i>Scandal--</i>
<i>bad timing or bad taste?</i>

23:17.076 --> 23:18.981
<i>The "Mode"</i>
<i>fashion storm cover</i>

23:19.066 --> 23:20.971
<i>hit the stands this morning,</i>

23:21.055 --> 23:23.002
<i>fresh on the heels</i>
<i>of that devastating tornado</i>

23:23.044 --> 23:25.583
<i>in one of those flat states</i>
<i>I can't find on a map.</i> 

23:25.667 --> 23:27.742
<i>The question is what did</i>
<i>the "Mode" leadership know,</i>

23:27.784 --> 23:30.323
<i>when did they know it</i>
<i>and what were they wearing?</i>

23:30.408 --> 23:32.312
<i>with issues</i>
<i>flying off the stands,</i>

23:32.354 --> 23:34.978
<i>it's no mystery</i>
<i>why the</i> Meade-iots

23:35.021 --> 23:36.925
<i>have stayed strangely silent--</i>
<i>controversy sells...</i>

23:37.010 --> 23:39.084
<i>and gets ratings,</i>

23:39.168 --> 23:40.733
<i>which is why</i>
<i>I'll make sure this story</i>

23:40.819 --> 23:43.484
<i>does not go away.</i>

23:45.050 --> 23:47.970
Hey. Any news?
Did you find out what happened?

23:48.055 --> 23:50.933
No, I've just been dealing
with this P.R. crisis.

23:50.976 --> 23:53.811
The press is not
leaving us alone. Oh, no.

23:55.758 --> 24:00.836
Uh, don't worry I'm gonna deal
with this. Hey, guys.

24:00.921 --> 24:03.263
Uh, as I mentioned, we're having
a press conference tomorrow.

24:03.264 --> 24:04.094
I'm sorry. We don't want you,

24:04.179 --> 24:07.311
we want to talk to her,
our favorite sweaty Modie.

24:07.395 --> 24:09.596
Now is it true that
you're the one responsible

24:09.681 --> 24:11.288
for the "Mode" cover fiasco?

24:11.331 --> 24:12.813
What? No.

24:12.855 --> 24:15.140
Oh, you're saying
this <i>isn't</i> a picture of you

24:15.183 --> 24:18.821
giving final approval for the issue?
- Well, yes, that's me, but--

24:18.907 --> 24:19.280
Guilty.

24:19.281 --> 24:21.784
Guys, guys. Betty is
not responsible for this.

24:21.869 --> 24:22.535
Its name is Betty.

24:22.536 --> 24:24.831
In fact, she's the one who
tried to stop this from happening.

24:24.916 --> 24:26.354
Oh, she did?

24:26.440 --> 24:28.978
Because about the time
your issue was being shipped,

24:29.064 --> 24:32.152
we have footage of her
doing this...

24:32.238 --> 24:34.057
buying questionable
meat products

24:34.142 --> 24:37.020
and stealing toys from children.
- No, you got it all wrong.

24:37.062 --> 24:39.269
See, that is how I got the idea
to call a skywriter.

24:39.270 --> 24:39.685
Skywriter?

24:39.728 --> 24:42.141
Yeah, it was
actually very clever.

24:42.225 --> 24:45.103
Betty hired a skywriter to try--
- This story is getting more

24:45.145 --> 24:47.346
any last comments,
Tornado Girl?

24:48.869 --> 24:51.916
<i>Um...</i>

24:52.001 --> 24:53.948
I have to tell the truth.

24:54.033 --> 24:57.841
Oh, don't be a boob, Daniel.
Have you seen these numbers?

24:57.926 --> 24:59.831
Connor asked us
to increase our revenues,

24:59.872 --> 25:03.428
and this is the highest selling
issue of "Mode" in history.

25:03.469 --> 25:05.374
But Betty's getting blamed
for it.

25:05.459 --> 25:08.083
I never would have
agreed to this

25:08.167 --> 25:09.986
if I knew
that was gonna happen.

25:09.987 --> 25:11.088
Oh, tra-la-la-la-la.

25:11.172 --> 25:14.092
So what if some frumpy assistant
gets her feelings hurt today?

25:14.135 --> 25:16.123
She's used to it.

25:16.209 --> 25:18.409
Ultimately, it may help us
avoid layoffs tomorrow.

25:18.494 --> 25:20.695
Trust me.
It'll all blow over.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.064
What if it doesn't?

25:23.106 --> 25:25.604
You and I run this company.
We cannot get our hands dirty.

25:25.645 --> 25:29.285
Taking the fall is what
the little people are for.

25:38.765 --> 25:40.881
Oh.

25:40.923 --> 25:42.912
Please stop harassing me.

25:42.955 --> 25:46.975
I am not the bad guy. You should
be ashamed of yourself.

25:47.060 --> 25:51.038
That is disgusting and not even
physically possible.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.985
somebody put
my cell phone number

25:53.069 --> 25:55.100
on enemiesoftheheartland.com

25:55.143 --> 25:57.978
I really don't understand

25:58.021 --> 26:00.009
how this ended up happening,

26:00.052 --> 26:02.887
because I did everything to stop
that issue from going out,

26:02.972 --> 26:05.766
and now I'm getting blamed
for it.

26:05.850 --> 26:07.924
You know,
I hate that saying--

26:07.965 --> 26:09.870
"no good deed
goes unpunished"--

26:09.955 --> 26:12.367
But it really seems
to apply here.

26:12.410 --> 26:15.414
You know what? That's just like
my pert getting denied.

26:15.457 --> 26:17.403
I went through
all the right channels,

26:17.446 --> 26:20.408
and still, I get-- fudge!
- Fudge!

26:20.493 --> 26:22.863
I just feel
so helpless, you know?

26:22.947 --> 26:26.291
It's like everything is
just spinning out of control,

26:26.375 --> 26:29.973
you know gaining momentum,
like a...

26:30.014 --> 26:31.115
tornado?

26:32.724 --> 26:34.839
Justin.

26:34.882 --> 26:37.082
You, too?

26:37.167 --> 26:39.113
It's not personal,
Aunt Betty.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.060
There just hasn't been
a T-shirt-worthy scandal

26:41.144 --> 26:43.642
since Winona had her troubles.

26:43.684 --> 26:45.123
Okay, that's enough.

26:45.207 --> 26:49.566
My girls may be a lot of things,
but helpless isn't one of them.

26:49.609 --> 26:53.502
So the question is,
what are you gonna do now?

26:56.719 --> 26:58.750
Hmm?

27:04.681 --> 27:07.051
Thank you so much
for coming with me.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.998
I don't think
it's gonna get physical,

27:09.082 --> 27:10.945
but I might need someone here
to restrain me.

27:10.986 --> 27:13.441
Please. I'm happy to be
anywhere I'm anonymous.

27:13.484 --> 27:15.642
Hey, aren't you Tornado Girl?

27:17.250 --> 27:20.424
No. I just look like her.

27:20.467 --> 27:22.160
We're here to see
Councilman Rodriguez.

27:22.161 --> 27:24.106
- Well, I'm afraid the councilman
is unavailable.

27:24.148 --> 27:26.877
You want to make an appointment
to come back next week?

27:26.878 --> 27:27.364
Next week?

27:27.407 --> 27:30.538
Mm. I got a problem right now.
- Forget it.

27:30.581 --> 27:31.936
Hilda,
she said "unavailable."

27:32.020 --> 27:34.474
That's what I say when
Daniel's in the bathroom.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.591
He must be here.

27:36.675 --> 27:37.944
Oh! Look.

27:38.030 --> 27:40.442
Hilda. Hey,
how'd that permit work out?

27:40.526 --> 27:43.066
Oh, you didn't hear?

27:43.108 --> 27:45.140
I got rejected.

27:45.181 --> 27:48.271
Oh, wow. Uh, I'm sorry.

27:48.355 --> 27:49.795
You're sorry. You're sorry?

27:49.879 --> 27:52.757
You told me to do things
aboveboard, and what happens?

27:52.799 --> 27:55.634
I get screwed.
Take it down a notch.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.158
All right.

27:57.200 --> 28:00.290
Councilman, I am
one your constituents,

28:00.375 --> 28:02.237
and I got a problem

28:02.321 --> 28:04.226
how you gonna fix it?

28:04.268 --> 28:06.934
Uh, they rejected your permit.
There's nothing I can do.

28:06.976 --> 28:08.881
The law is the law.

28:08.965 --> 28:11.250
The law is the law?

28:11.336 --> 28:13.240
That's the best you got?

28:13.282 --> 28:16.202
It seems like you could do
a little bit better

28:16.287 --> 28:18.319
when you are destroying
someone's dreams.

28:21.027 --> 28:23.101
This is one of
the only good things

28:23.142 --> 28:26.021
that has happened to my sister
in a long time.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.306
Lots of people have
home businesses.

28:28.390 --> 28:31.184
There's got to be something
you could do..

28:31.226 --> 28:33.088
isn't that your job?
- Betty.

28:33.172 --> 28:34.611
I'm coming.

28:40.494 --> 28:42.483
Oh! Oh! Aah!

28:44.261 --> 28:45.784
Oh.
- Marc!

28:45.869 --> 28:47.942
Shh! Silence.

28:47.985 --> 28:51.032
Powerful forces are
arrayed against you.

28:51.116 --> 28:53.909
What?
What are you talking about?

28:53.995 --> 28:57.676
Things are not what they seem.
- Okay, not in the mood.

28:59.496 --> 29:01.612
Not all birds
fly south in winter.

29:01.696 --> 29:04.236
I don't understand you.
Stop being cryptic.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.225
Oh. For god sake, Betty,

29:06.267 --> 29:09.822
I'm not gonna jeopardize my job
by spelling it out to you.

29:09.907 --> 29:11.853
If you want to know
what really happened

29:11.938 --> 29:13.800
with the issues going out,

29:13.884 --> 29:16.932
then go talk to Phil
in the loading dock.

29:17.017 --> 29:19.852
He knows.

29:21.291 --> 29:24.211
I need to know
why the issue wasn't stopped

29:24.253 --> 29:26.073
after Daniel called you.

29:26.158 --> 29:28.581
Yeah, well, too bad,
'cause I ain't talkin'.

29:28.582 --> 29:29.712
Well, I ain't leavin'.

29:31.363 --> 29:35.214
You can't get away from me.
- You're like a gnat with glasses.

29:35.299 --> 29:37.542
Well, I could do this all day,

29:37.584 --> 29:39.530
'cause if I'm not getting
hate mail

29:39.616 --> 29:41.858
from the daughters of Kansas,
then it's a vacation.

29:41.943 --> 29:45.837
Yeah. You got a raw deal.

29:45.879 --> 29:48.249
You're a pain in my ass,

29:48.291 --> 29:50.788
but you don't deserve this.

29:50.830 --> 29:54.132
All right, come here.

29:54.173 --> 29:56.586
Listen,
you didn't hear this from me,

29:56.670 --> 29:58.575
but I got a call, all right.

29:58.618 --> 30:00.522
It wasn't telling me
to <i>hold</i> the issue.

30:00.606 --> 30:03.315
It was telling me to ship it.

30:03.400 --> 30:06.065
What? Well,
who told you to do that?

30:09.959 --> 30:13.895
Uh, Betty?

30:15.630 --> 30:17.746
You lied to my face, Daniel.

30:17.831 --> 30:19.778
You have to believe me.

30:19.819 --> 30:22.692
You were never supposed
to get blamed for this.

30:22.693 --> 30:23.290
But I did.

30:23.332 --> 30:25.702
And I defended you.
You saw me.

30:25.744 --> 30:28.834
Yeah, but you knew the truth,
and you said nothing.

30:28.919 --> 30:31.797
Look, things
are not as simple

30:31.838 --> 30:34.082
as you and I wish they were.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.875
This company is in a lot
of trouble. We need money.

30:36.959 --> 30:39.880
I only agreed to it because
it was a business decision.

30:39.922 --> 30:42.800
It was a way to save Jobs.
And ruin my reputation.

30:42.884 --> 30:45.085
Look, I never intended
for that to happen.

30:45.169 --> 30:47.709
This is gonna blow over.
- Blow over?

30:47.751 --> 30:50.883
I'm not Daniel Meade.

30:50.925 --> 30:53.041
I'm an assistant,

30:53.126 --> 30:55.284
and I don't want
to be an assistant

30:55.326 --> 30:58.035
for the rest of my life.

30:58.077 --> 31:00.913
The only thing I have going
for me is my reputation,

31:00.997 --> 31:03.706
and now I don't have that.

31:03.790 --> 31:07.134
I'm Tornado Girl.

31:23.514 --> 31:25.333
Chocolate chip.

31:25.376 --> 31:28.634
Oh, <i>papi,</i> thank you.

31:30.708 --> 31:33.755
I'll get it.

31:35.363 --> 31:37.395
Evening.
I'm Councilman Rodriguez.

31:37.479 --> 31:39.764
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- No, sir.

31:39.807 --> 31:43.138
Mr. Councilman, it is an honor
to have you in our home. Please.

31:43.139 --> 31:43.658
Thank you.

31:43.700 --> 31:47.382
He's been here before, <i>papi.</i>
I gave him a haircut, remember?

31:47.466 --> 31:50.090
So what are you gonna do now,
evict us?

31:50.176 --> 31:52.122
I kind of felt bad
about earlier today,

31:52.207 --> 31:55.126
and I don't want to be the guy
who destroyed your dreams,

31:55.169 --> 31:57.709
so I've, uh, done
a little bit of research.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.994
What is that?

32:00.078 --> 32:01.306
Your loophole.

32:01.390 --> 32:04.268
See, if 30% of your profits
come from products you sell,

32:04.310 --> 32:07.569
then we can get you
that permit, for a boutique.

32:07.654 --> 32:10.024
A boutique?
So wait, wait, wait.

32:10.108 --> 32:13.621
If I sell things, I can cut hair.
- That's right.

32:13.663 --> 32:16.118
So what am I gonna sell?
Are you kidding?

32:16.202 --> 32:18.699
First you can get rid
of this hideous lamp,

32:18.742 --> 32:21.620
and then get rid of half a dozen
of those saints

32:21.704 --> 32:24.624
and while you're at it,
get rid of Betty's hats.

32:24.667 --> 32:26.825
Well, actually,
I was thinking you could...

32:26.866 --> 32:29.660
sell some candles. See?

32:29.745 --> 32:31.099
Just a thought.

32:31.184 --> 32:33.469
<i>Muchísmo gracias,</i>
Councilman Rodriguez.

32:33.553 --> 32:37.151
Oh, please, call me Archie.
- Okay, Archie.

32:37.193 --> 32:39.681
Hey, let me get my camera
before you go.

32:39.682 --> 32:40.409
<i>Papi.</i>

32:40.452 --> 32:42.780
Wow. Well, thank you.

32:42.864 --> 32:44.642
I... I owe you.

32:44.684 --> 32:45.742
Well...

32:46.842 --> 32:49.339
Well, good luck.

32:49.381 --> 32:50.736
Thanks.

32:50.778 --> 32:53.824
Hey, uh, if you ever need
a haircut or--or a candle...

32:53.910 --> 32:55.687
Just say the word.

32:55.772 --> 32:57.676
Since I've sort of
done you a favor,

32:57.760 --> 32:59.708
I don't think
it would be ethical

32:59.750 --> 33:02.585
to, uh,
get a free haircut, so...

33:02.628 --> 33:04.997
Yeah. Oh, I was gonna charge you,
Councilman.

33:06.987 --> 33:09.299
Well, then I'll definitely
be stopping by.

33:09.300 --> 33:09.568
Okay.

33:09.652 --> 33:11.896
All right, good night.

33:11.939 --> 33:13.885
Night.

33:15.450 --> 33:17.778
Okay, everybody say <i>"queso."</i>

33:17.821 --> 33:19.513
Hey.
<i>- Papi.</i>

33:19.556 --> 33:21.037
Where'd he go?

33:31.025 --> 33:32.633
I spoke to Phil

33:32.717 --> 33:35.172
and Daniel.

33:35.257 --> 33:37.119
I know what happened.

33:37.203 --> 33:41.774
I officially have no idea
what you're talking about...

33:41.858 --> 33:43.509
Hmm.

33:43.551 --> 33:45.159
But I'm sorry.

33:45.244 --> 33:48.715
We're very different people.

33:48.799 --> 33:50.703
That said,
we're in the same position,

33:50.788 --> 33:53.750
and sometimes we have he to
look out for each other,

33:53.835 --> 33:54.766
so...

33:54.850 --> 33:57.221
Well, thank you.

33:57.305 --> 34:00.098
Clearly Cliff has had
a good influence on you.

34:00.184 --> 34:02.849
He's a very lucky man.

34:02.892 --> 34:05.769
He's... yeah.

34:05.855 --> 34:08.351
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
He's really, really lucky.

34:08.436 --> 34:10.594
Uh, what was that?

34:10.678 --> 34:12.795
Nothing.
Uh, everything's great.

34:12.879 --> 34:17.196
Everything is... perfect.

34:17.281 --> 34:20.158
Uh, well, this may be
none of my business,

34:20.243 --> 34:23.036
but it doesn't <i>seem</i>
like everything's okay.

34:23.079 --> 34:24.559
You're right.

34:24.643 --> 34:27.649
It's none of your business.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.897
What are you
still looking at me for?

34:35.181 --> 34:36.917
All right, fine.

34:37.002 --> 34:39.541
I-I...

34:39.625 --> 34:42.842
I cheated on Cliff
at your party,

34:42.884 --> 34:45.255
and that's why I asked him
to marry me,

34:45.339 --> 34:47.751
because I felt so guilty.

34:47.793 --> 34:50.629
And now I feel like
such a terrible person

34:50.714 --> 34:52.322
because of it,

34:52.406 --> 34:54.692
and i'm sure
that's what you feel, too.

34:54.775 --> 34:58.120
Marc,
I know you're a good person.

35:00.955 --> 35:03.241
But I also know
that it really hurts

35:03.325 --> 35:07.176
when someone you trust
lies to you.

35:07.218 --> 35:10.223
Look, if you love him,

35:10.265 --> 35:12.677
he deserves
to know the truth.

35:15.428 --> 35:16.868
Rest assured,

35:16.910 --> 35:19.746
Meade publications is doing
everything it possibly can

35:19.787 --> 35:22.200
to rectify
this terrible situation.

35:22.284 --> 35:24.697
By tomorrow--
or the latest, next week--

35:24.781 --> 35:27.193
every issue will
be off the newsstands.

35:27.279 --> 35:30.622
And how are you dealing
with Tornado Girl?

35:30.706 --> 35:34.473
Fired, reprimanded, banished
to a basement somewhere?

35:34.515 --> 35:36.673
Now, now.

35:36.758 --> 35:40.017
That is an internal issue
that we are handling privately.

35:40.101 --> 35:42.302
We're all human,
and we all make mistakes.

35:42.344 --> 35:44.164
So thank you--

35:44.206 --> 35:46.745
Wilhelmina's right.
We all do make mistakes,

35:46.830 --> 35:50.174
especially those of us
in charge.

35:50.258 --> 35:52.163
I was the one
who made the decision

35:52.247 --> 35:55.167
to let the magazine run
in the newsstands.

35:55.252 --> 35:58.892
It was a very cynical decision,
and I regret it...

35:58.933 --> 36:01.557
but not nearly as much
as I regret

36:01.600 --> 36:05.451
watching my assistant,
Betty Suarez, take the blame.

36:05.493 --> 36:07.567
It was my fault, mine alone.

36:07.652 --> 36:11.334
Well, I-I, for one,
am shocked, Daniel,

36:11.418 --> 36:13.492
uh, personally shocked
and embarrassed

36:13.576 --> 36:17.343
that our company is involved
in something like this...

36:17.428 --> 36:19.417
which is why
Meade publications

36:19.501 --> 36:22.337
will donate all profits
from the sale of this issue

36:22.421 --> 36:26.018
to a relief fund to benefit
the victims of these tornadoes.

36:26.104 --> 36:28.346
Uh, that's...
That's all I have to say.

36:28.389 --> 36:30.716
Thank you, everyone.

36:34.399 --> 36:36.134
Did we hear correctly?

36:36.175 --> 36:38.503
All proceeds from the sale
of this month's magazine...

36:39.095 --> 36:42.735
will be going to tornado victims?

36:48.533 --> 36:50.522
So what did you want
to tell me

36:50.607 --> 36:53.062
that was so important
I had to rush over?

36:55.727 --> 36:58.986
Well, how do I say this?
- Uh...

37:01.060 --> 37:03.049
I crashed your car.

37:03.133 --> 37:05.207
Oh.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.492
God.

37:07.578 --> 37:10.539
I thought it was
something much worse.

37:10.625 --> 37:13.121
Whew.

37:16.380 --> 37:18.622
Actually,
there is something else.

37:20.569 --> 37:23.024
You better sit down.

37:43.507 --> 37:44.946
Hey, Tornado Boy.

37:47.443 --> 37:49.178
Hey, Molly.

37:49.263 --> 37:51.802
So is that what
you're gonna call me now?

37:51.844 --> 37:54.341
What? It's cool,
like a superhero name.

37:55.780 --> 37:59.462
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm impressed.

37:59.546 --> 38:02.001
It's not very often
you get to see a big shot

38:02.044 --> 38:04.709
throw himself under a bus
for an assistant.

38:04.794 --> 38:08.095
Well, ahem. Thanks.

38:08.138 --> 38:10.212
It looks like
your ankle's okay.

38:10.296 --> 38:12.454
I have a splint.

38:12.497 --> 38:15.417
Is it weird that I'm a little
excited about having a splint?

38:15.501 --> 38:18.135
I've never had one before.
You wanna sign it?

38:18.136 --> 38:18.421
Sure.

38:18.464 --> 38:21.087
I'm a little hopped up
on painkillers right now.

38:21.130 --> 38:24.219
Oh, well, please.
You're welcome to sit down, if you'd like.

38:24.304 --> 38:27.181
Connor should be around here somewhere.
- Actually,

38:27.224 --> 38:30.017
it's our anniversary.
He's taking us to Del Posto.

38:30.101 --> 38:34.164
Oh, well, make sure
you don't drink wine.

38:34.249 --> 38:36.196
The painkillers.

38:36.238 --> 38:39.243
Right.

38:51.431 --> 38:54.055
I am so proud of you both.
Mm.

38:54.139 --> 38:56.629
You fought for yourselves,
and you won.

38:56.630 --> 38:57.314
Yeah, I taped

38:57.398 --> 39:00.742
and I just can't stop watching it.
- Is there a bottle of champagne...

39:00.826 --> 39:01.145
uh-oh.

39:01.146 --> 39:03.746
If it's not made in
France, it's sparkling wine,

39:03.831 --> 39:05.778
and that bottle's
from New Jersey.

39:08.655 --> 39:11.449
What's the matter, baby?
I thought you were happy.

39:11.491 --> 39:13.141
Everything's back to normal.

39:13.226 --> 39:15.299
It is, and normal is good.
Believe me.

39:15.342 --> 39:17.373
If I never hear the word
"tornado" again,

39:17.416 --> 39:19.405
I'll be just fine.

39:19.489 --> 39:21.225
It's just...

39:21.267 --> 39:23.214
there was a moment there
where I thought

39:23.298 --> 39:26.091
I had actually accomplished
something really great,

39:26.176 --> 39:28.503
you know,
something that would...

39:28.546 --> 39:31.213
make normal different...

39:31.254 --> 39:33.582
more, I guess.
I don't know.

39:33.624 --> 39:38.449
<i>Mija,</i> you keep putting one foot
in front of the other,

39:38.533 --> 39:41.284
open your eyes
to the opportunities,

39:41.369 --> 39:45.093
you're gonna get to where
you wanna go, guaranteed.

39:45.136 --> 39:47.421
I love you.

39:47.505 --> 39:50.552
I love you, too.

39:50.638 --> 39:54.108
# where has my light gone? #

39:54.149 --> 39:56.689
# where has my fit gone? #

39:56.773 --> 40:01.259
# what keeps us burning

40:01.344 --> 40:05.788

40:05.830 --> 40:08.919
# should I be afraid,
or is it just... #

40:09.004 --> 40:12.305
Connor, now that Daniel has go
and given everything away,

40:12.390 --> 40:13.786
we need to strategize.

40:13.871 --> 40:16.791
I'm afraid it's gonna be a late night.
- Uh...

40:16.834 --> 40:19.795
Well, that's not gonna be
a problem for you, is it?

40:19.838 --> 40:21.107
No.

40:21.193 --> 40:24.197
I had dinner plans,
but I can reschedule.

40:24.240 --> 40:25.466
Good.

40:25.552 --> 40:29.063
We're very lucky
to have you on board.

It's always work.

40:54.372 --> 40:55.302
Molly.

40:55.387 --> 40:56.783
I gotta go.

40:56.826 --> 40:58.308
Don't run. Please.
