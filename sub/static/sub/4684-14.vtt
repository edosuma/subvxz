WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:04.800
No, no, no,
don't touch that dial.

00:04.866 --> 00:08.133
Here's what's
on my mind tonight.

00:10.266 --> 00:12.300
Greta's a busy lady.

00:12.366 --> 00:14.566
She's got one hubby on ice.

00:14.633 --> 00:16.600
Another one in the cellar.

00:16.666 --> 00:19.366
And a lover
with a murderous plan.

00:19.433 --> 00:21.666
Next time you see me..

00:21.733 --> 00:23.066
...you're gonna be
an unmarried woman.

00:23.133 --> 00:24.900
Will Greta ever find happiness

00:24.966 --> 00:26.833
in small town Springwood?

00:26.900 --> 00:29.833
That Greta,
she's some kinda dame.

00:29.900 --> 00:31.666
Mary Crosby stars..

00:31.733 --> 00:34.733
...on the next
"Freddy's Nightmares."

00:55.233 --> 00:57.633
You're in Springwood now

00:57.700 --> 00:59.600
and you're all mine.

01:31.733 --> 01:33.900
This is the happiest day
of my life.

01:33.966 --> 01:35.233
Oh, Eugene.

01:36.566 --> 01:37.833
Take me.

01:38.633 --> 01:39.600
Now.

01:54.566 --> 01:56.733
What are you doing in my bed?

01:56.800 --> 01:58.866
'I told you never
to come into my room.'

01:58.933 --> 02:02.066
When I say never,
I mean never.

02:02.133 --> 02:03.600
I'm sorry, Greta.

02:05.266 --> 02:07.266
'Get out of here.'

02:07.333 --> 02:09.300
I-I just wanted
to say goodnight.

02:09.366 --> 02:10.633
Goodnight.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.333
Now get lost.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.200
Why do you keep
treatin' me like manure?

02:16.266 --> 02:18.866
Because you smell like manure.

02:18.933 --> 02:20.833
Look at you,
you make me sick.

02:20.900 --> 02:23.100
'You never wash,
you're teeth are rotting.'

02:23.866 --> 02:25.900
But most of all..

02:25.966 --> 02:27.700
...I don't trust you.

02:27.766 --> 02:29.200
You blackmailed me
into marrying you.

02:29.266 --> 02:31.500
What's to stop you from killing
me and inheriting all the money

02:31.566 --> 02:33.066
I won in the lottery?

02:33.133 --> 02:35.300
I didn't marry you
for your money.

02:35.366 --> 02:37.400
I love you, Greta.

02:37.466 --> 02:39.000
Ever since I first
set eyes on you

02:39.066 --> 02:41.000
sneakin' across
that graveyard that night

02:41.066 --> 02:42.600
you killed your first husband.

02:42.666 --> 02:44.533
Hank was my second husband.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.033
I don't care
how many they've been.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.200
Just as long as I'm the last.

02:50.833 --> 02:52.900
I wanna be the father
of your children.

02:52.966 --> 02:55.233
Get away from me.

02:56.300 --> 02:59.233
God, what a disgusting thought.

03:01.266 --> 03:02.733
You make me sick.

03:04.733 --> 03:06.800
Get out here. Now!

03:07.600 --> 03:08.700
Tsch!

03:09.900 --> 03:14.200
That Greta is one cold dish.

03:14.266 --> 03:18.400
A real man hater,
but don't worry guys.

03:18.466 --> 03:21.200
I got a way
to turn up her body heat.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.066
Why don't you open a window
in here once in a while?

03:37.133 --> 03:39.433
This place could use
some fresh air.

03:44.533 --> 03:46.666
What do you want for dinner?

03:46.733 --> 03:48.666
You gonna cook?

03:48.733 --> 03:50.100
You sure as hell can't.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.033
I'm sure whatever you fix

03:54.100 --> 03:55.900
will be delicious.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.400
You know, if it weren't for him

03:58.466 --> 04:00.833
we could get some servants
around here.

04:00.900 --> 04:03.333
And live like rich people
are supposed to live.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.066
I told you.

04:06.133 --> 04:10.266
I'll bury him as soon
as we consummate our marriage.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.900
'Once that happens there's
no need to keep him around.'

04:13.966 --> 04:15.900
'You'll be my wife.'

04:15.966 --> 04:17.033
Forever..

04:18.200 --> 04:19.500
...and ever.

04:20.566 --> 04:22.233
Don't get your hopes up, Eugene.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.033
I'd rather be staked
to an anthill

04:24.100 --> 04:25.266
than sleep with you.

04:27.466 --> 04:28.933
You expecting company?

04:39.066 --> 04:43.933
Uh.. Hi, Wes Roscoe.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.200
I get it. My brother Hank
didn't tell you about me, huh?

04:49.333 --> 04:51.866
Uh, may I come in?
It's a little chilly out here.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.933
Oh, uh-uh, yes, of course.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.133
- Please.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.800
- Sorry.
- Ooh.

04:58.800 --> 04:59.800
Eugene.

05:01.233 --> 05:04.633
So w-what brings you
to Springwood, Wes?

05:04.700 --> 05:07.033
A birthday, tomorrow Hank
and I'll be 30 years old

05:07.100 --> 05:09.266
and we've celebrated each
and every one of those years

05:09.333 --> 05:11.166
and thanks to a little bonus
I got at work, this year

05:11.233 --> 05:13.533
is gonna be no exception.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.400
You called?

05:15.466 --> 05:16.933
Hang this up.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.866
'So who was that?
Your gardener?'

05:21.933 --> 05:23.200
Well, no, uh..

05:25.333 --> 05:26.800
Actually that was..

05:28.300 --> 05:30.166
...my husband.

05:30.233 --> 05:32.233
Greta, did I miss
something here?

05:32.300 --> 05:33.766
Aren't you married
to my brother?

05:33.833 --> 05:35.733
I was.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.033
Maybe you better sit down, Wes.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Alright.

05:42.766 --> 05:46.500
See, uh...I'd been married
to Hank about a month

05:46.566 --> 05:48.666
before he started to feel like

05:48.733 --> 05:50.700
maybe he didn't
wanna be tied down.

05:50.766 --> 05:53.333
You know, he was never
the marrying kind.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.533
That's why I was so surprised
to hear about you two.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.833
Well, it, it wasn't a marriage
made in heaven but..

06:01.033 --> 06:03.066
...I loved Hank and..

06:03.133 --> 06:05.866
...and when he walked out
on me I..

06:05.933 --> 06:07.500
...I was devastated.

06:08.666 --> 06:10.133
He left you?

06:11.600 --> 06:12.666
Gone.

06:12.733 --> 06:13.700
Poof.

06:15.866 --> 06:17.933
I never heard from him again.

06:19.333 --> 06:23.533
Well, eventually I
had the marriage annulled and..

06:23.600 --> 06:25.633
...and then I married..

06:25.700 --> 06:26.700
...Eugene.

06:28.033 --> 06:29.700
So what you're telling me
is you have no idea

06:29.766 --> 06:32.300
where he is
or what happened to him?

06:33.333 --> 06:34.733
I did it.

06:35.566 --> 06:36.533
Hm?

06:39.433 --> 06:42.133
Would you want me
to do anything else?

06:42.200 --> 06:43.700
Uh, that's all.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.833
You can go go back
to your room now, Eugene.

06:50.100 --> 06:51.800
Eugene.

06:51.866 --> 06:53.933
You look awful familiar to me.

06:54.966 --> 06:56.300
I do?

06:56.366 --> 06:58.600
This is my former brother-in-law

06:58.666 --> 06:59.900
I guess you'd say.

07:02.700 --> 07:04.633
Uh, Wes Roscoe. Hi.

07:05.566 --> 07:07.300
Eugene Moss.

07:08.766 --> 07:12.533
Well, uh...nice
to meet you, Eugene.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.900
It's Eugene.

07:15.433 --> 07:17.833
Sorry about that, Eugene.

07:20.333 --> 07:23.866
Well, I should, uh,
probably be on my way.

07:23.933 --> 07:26.833
It won't be the first time that
I've had to track Hank down.

07:28.466 --> 07:32.466
Well, I hate to, uh,
trouble you again, uh, Eugene

07:32.533 --> 07:34.533
but I'm afraid
I'll need my raincoat.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.300
I just can't get over
how much you look like him.

07:40.366 --> 07:44.366
I mean, the same hair,
the same eyes, the same..

07:44.433 --> 07:45.466
...mouth.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.666
Uh, same everything.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.533
Physically we're identical

07:50.866 --> 07:52.733
You don't say.

07:55.166 --> 07:57.200
I don't suppose
you happen to know

07:57.266 --> 08:00.833
the name of a good hotel here
in Springwood?

08:00.900 --> 08:02.366
I imagine I really
should do some

08:02.433 --> 08:04.000
checking around
in the morning.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.066
Oh, don't be silly. There's no
need to stay in a hotel.

08:06.133 --> 08:08.166
We have plenty of rooms here.

08:08.233 --> 08:11.733
Impose on you, I couldn't.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.900
You wouldn't be imposing at all.

08:15.866 --> 08:18.266
Eugene, Wes has decided
to spend the night.

08:18.333 --> 08:21.766
Please make sure that the towels
in the guest room are clean.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.566
I just wanted to thank you
for a..

08:48.633 --> 08:49.966
...wonderful dinner.

08:50.033 --> 08:52.000
It was my pleasure.

08:52.066 --> 08:55.633
Wes, would you be a dear
and help me with my dress?

08:57.366 --> 08:58.300
Your dress?

08:59.633 --> 09:01.300
The zipper's stuck.

09:04.466 --> 09:07.333
And, uh...what would you
like me to do?

09:11.266 --> 09:12.533
Unzip it.

09:15.566 --> 09:16.900
What about your husband?

09:18.500 --> 09:20.933
Wouldn't he get the wrong idea?

09:21.000 --> 09:22.633
Eugene won't come in.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.900
I don't allow him
in my bedroom.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.300
Oh.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.133
I know that it's none
of my, uh, business.

09:33.700 --> 09:34.966
But if you don't allow him
in your bedroom

09:35.033 --> 09:37.666
why did you marry him?

09:37.733 --> 09:40.400
Well, at the time
I was vulnerable.

09:41.566 --> 09:44.266
Eugene knew it and, uh..

09:44.333 --> 09:45.633
...took advantage of me.

09:48.666 --> 09:51.400
Oh, Wes, it's,
it's-it's like a nightmare

09:51.466 --> 09:54.000
living in this house
with that little gnome.

09:54.066 --> 09:57.533
Just thinking about him
makes my skin crawl.

09:59.133 --> 10:00.866
Why don't you just..

10:00.933 --> 10:02.566
...get a divorce?

10:02.633 --> 10:05.900
I couldn't, I, I'd have to give
him half my money.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.300
Half what money?

10:11.633 --> 10:14.400
The twenty million
that I won in the lottery.

10:19.733 --> 10:23.933
You won...20 million dollars?

10:24.000 --> 10:28.566
Oh, Wes...I feel
so helpless and trapped.

10:28.633 --> 10:30.300
Hold me, Wes.

10:30.366 --> 10:32.533
Hold me like Hank did.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.800
Oh, Wes.

10:35.800 --> 10:39.600
You feel so strong and...hard.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.700
'Kiss me, Wes.'

10:50.666 --> 10:53.466
I-I can't do this.

10:53.533 --> 10:55.300
Please, Wes.

10:55.366 --> 10:58.400
It's been so long since I've..

10:58.466 --> 11:01.400
...been touched
by a real man, I've..

11:01.466 --> 11:03.700
I've forgotten
what it felt like.

11:04.700 --> 11:07.900
Oh, you poor, poor little thing.

11:13.233 --> 11:14.833
I want you forever.

11:18.966 --> 11:20.233
But, Greta..

11:21.800 --> 11:24.433
...you're married.
I mean, there-there's no way..

11:24.500 --> 11:25.800
You know..

11:25.866 --> 11:27.300
There's one way.

11:28.766 --> 11:30.233
The only way.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.400
What way is that?

11:36.433 --> 11:39.933
Well...between the two
of us we could..

11:40.000 --> 11:42.800
...we could figure out a way to
make it look like an accident.

11:44.433 --> 11:45.400
Oh.

11:47.466 --> 11:49.433
Greta, I'm not a murderer.

11:51.266 --> 11:52.233
Neither am I.

11:52.300 --> 11:53.333
It's just that I..

11:53.400 --> 11:55.366
...I-I'm so desperate.

11:55.433 --> 11:57.033
I'm ready to do anything.

12:00.566 --> 12:01.933
Yeah, but..

12:02.000 --> 12:03.466
...killing, I mean,
that's not the answer.

12:03.533 --> 12:05.733
They-they-they hang you
for that.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.700
I know.

12:10.666 --> 12:13.300
I'm sorry, Wes, I..

12:13.366 --> 12:15.900
...I-I shouldn't have involved
you in my problems.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.933
You deserve better than me.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.366
You know, maybe, um..

12:28.433 --> 12:31.733
...maybe I just, I better go
to the guest room, um..

12:32.600 --> 12:34.566
...I don't feel right.

12:34.633 --> 12:35.900
Not yet.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.333
Not until you make love
to me again.

12:44.833 --> 12:47.900
I can't wait to see
the look on Greta's face.

12:50.966 --> 12:54.233
Boy, she ever gonna be surprised
when she sees me.

13:08.066 --> 13:10.500
What are you doing with my wife?

13:11.200 --> 13:12.700
Eugene.

13:12.766 --> 13:14.233
'Eugene, no.'

13:14.700 --> 13:16.500
No, no!

13:16.566 --> 13:18.533
- No.
- Uh.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.900
What? Did-did-did you
have a bad dream?

13:22.100 --> 13:23.766
You were right.

13:23.833 --> 13:25.233
About what?

13:25.300 --> 13:26.600
About Eugene.

13:27.733 --> 13:29.500
We gotta kill him.

13:34.133 --> 13:35.733
'What is this stuff?'

13:37.266 --> 13:38.233
Curare.

13:39.933 --> 13:42.800
It paralyzes
the respiratory muscles.

13:44.533 --> 13:47.533
Pygmy's put it on the tips
of their arrows.

13:50.333 --> 13:53.533
Now you sure
that Eugene likes champagne?

13:56.600 --> 13:59.033
He drank a half a case of it
on our wedding night.

14:00.666 --> 14:01.633
Good.

14:08.033 --> 14:11.466
'Ah, Eugene,
you're just in time.'

14:11.533 --> 14:13.033
Come help us celebrate, huh?

14:13.100 --> 14:14.733
Wes is moving to Springwood.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.900
Yes, Greta found me
the most perfect apartment.

14:16.966 --> 14:19.433
'You really must come by
sometime and have a look.'

14:19.500 --> 14:22.133
Eugene, uh...you look different.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.433
Did you get a haircut?

14:24.500 --> 14:25.500
No.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.133
Oh, Eugene,
you had your teeth fixed.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.300
I did it so as you wouldn't
get sick when you looked at me.

14:37.233 --> 14:38.466
Oh.

14:38.533 --> 14:41.200
If-if you worry about the cost.

14:41.266 --> 14:42.933
I hawked my shotgun
so as I could

14:43.000 --> 14:45.400
pay for it with my own money.

14:45.466 --> 14:47.733
Oh, Eugene.

14:47.800 --> 14:52.033
Well, Eugene, all I can say is
you look marvelous.

14:55.700 --> 14:58.233
Well, Greta, will you,
uh, do the honors?

15:02.166 --> 15:04.633
'I think it's time we partied.'

15:07.500 --> 15:09.533
Eugene, where are you going?

15:09.600 --> 15:11.433
You love this champagne.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.633
I only drink champagne
when I got reason to celebrate.

15:20.766 --> 15:22.133
Uh, Eugene..

15:22.200 --> 15:24.200
Let him go.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.033
'Think hard, Wes. We've gotta
find someway to kill him.'

15:38.766 --> 15:41.866
You know, maybe we're just
being a little too subtle here.

15:41.933 --> 15:44.566
Maybe we should simply
knock him out.

15:44.633 --> 15:45.833
Pour a fifth of scotch
down his throat

15:45.900 --> 15:48.000
and drive him off a cliff.

15:49.566 --> 15:51.200
Darlin', I know it sounds crude.

15:52.566 --> 15:55.233
But you said Eugene
likes to drink, right?

15:56.533 --> 15:58.166
Okay.

15:58.233 --> 16:01.266
We make it look like
he had a few too many and.

16:01.333 --> 16:04.300
...simply went off
the side of the road.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.600
Yo, Eugene.

16:32.900 --> 16:33.933
Eugene?

17:11.833 --> 17:13.533
Looking for me?

17:17.133 --> 17:18.933
She talk you into killin' me?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.166
Or was it your idea?

17:20.233 --> 17:22.300
You.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.533
Ahh!

17:28.766 --> 17:30.433
Try this.

17:37.266 --> 17:38.300
Huh.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.900
I guess, that didn't
get the job done.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.100
This should do the trick.

17:50.766 --> 17:52.266
What are you waiting for?

17:52.333 --> 17:53.400
Once you get rid of me..

17:54.633 --> 17:56.100
...she's all yours.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.433
Yup, that should do it.

18:05.733 --> 18:07.733
So long, Wes.

18:12.866 --> 18:14.066
Wes.

18:14.133 --> 18:16.433
'Huh? I'm sorry.'

18:17.300 --> 18:19.500
Sorry, I must have dozed off.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.733
Are you sure
you wanna go through with this?

18:24.666 --> 18:27.033
Baby, I'd do anything for you.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.300
Greta..

18:31.366 --> 18:33.666
...the next time you see me..

18:33.733 --> 18:36.233
...you're gonna be
an unmarried woman.

18:51.433 --> 18:52.533
Eugene?

19:27.466 --> 19:28.533
Oh.

19:30.266 --> 19:31.300
Hank.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.633
How could this happen?

19:38.700 --> 19:40.233
Oh, my God.

19:41.733 --> 19:44.866
Wes, I-I had no idea.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.166
I never come down here.

19:47.233 --> 19:49.866
It-it must have been Eugene.

19:49.933 --> 19:52.466
He's a monster, Wes.

19:52.533 --> 19:54.800
He'd stop at nothing to have me.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.100
Liar.

20:02.266 --> 20:04.233
I can see it in your eyes.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.200
You killed my brother.

20:06.266 --> 20:07.266
No, Wes, I-I..

20:07.333 --> 20:09.633
...I swear,
you've got to believe me.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.200
You killed my brother.

20:12.266 --> 20:15.366
Wes, I'm telling you
it's not what you're thinking.

20:15.433 --> 20:16.766
- You killed my brother.
- No!

20:16.833 --> 20:18.566
Wes! Wes!

20:18.633 --> 20:19.666
Wes.

20:37.133 --> 20:39.166
- Eugene.
- Are you alright?

20:39.233 --> 20:40.733
I think so.

20:41.866 --> 20:44.733
But...why-why did you do it?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.366
Why did you save me
when you could have

20:47.433 --> 20:50.433
inherited 20 million dollars?

20:50.500 --> 20:52.966
You still don't get it, do you?

20:53.033 --> 20:54.766
I love you.

20:54.833 --> 20:56.800
Not your money.

20:57.933 --> 20:59.733
You do?

21:00.300 --> 21:01.933
Really? I..

21:02.000 --> 21:03.033
Well..

21:04.400 --> 21:06.300
...no one's ever loved me.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.800
Just for me.

21:22.300 --> 21:24.533
Oh, Eugene.

21:25.366 --> 21:27.433
That was incredible.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.000
I never thought it was possible

21:30.066 --> 21:34.433
to experience so much pleasure
in so many ways.

21:39.133 --> 21:41.500
If only I had known.

21:44.766 --> 21:46.400
I tried to tell you.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.100
I know, I was such a fool.

21:51.666 --> 21:53.800
'But you do forgive me,
don't you?'

22:00.866 --> 22:03.233
Till death do us apart.

22:05.966 --> 22:07.100
No!

22:15.033 --> 22:16.233
Ahh.

22:35.033 --> 22:37.300
Welcome to lifestyles

22:37.366 --> 22:39.933
of the dead and infamous.

22:40.900 --> 22:43.033
I'm your host Frederick Krueger.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.733
And we'll be right back

22:44.800 --> 22:47.333
with more champagne wishes

22:47.400 --> 22:49.700
and cadaver dreams.

22:50.933 --> 22:53.133
Here's to dead friends.

23:17.900 --> 23:19.533
I'm sorry, Eugene.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.233
I didn't mean to do this to you.

23:24.033 --> 23:27.333
You're the only man
that I ever really loved.

23:35.866 --> 23:38.366
Sorry, I can't give you
a decent burial, guys.

23:38.433 --> 23:41.166
But...I just don't see
how I could ever explain

23:41.233 --> 23:43.800
how I accidently
killed two husbands

23:43.866 --> 23:45.666
and a brother-in-law.

23:45.733 --> 23:47.700
I just don't think
it would hold up in court.

23:48.700 --> 23:50.633
Rest in peace, guys.

23:57.633 --> 23:58.600
Uh..

24:02.200 --> 24:05.466
I'll need you to sign
the receipt, Mrs. Moss.

24:05.533 --> 24:07.866
Oh, yes, of course, Herman

24:07.933 --> 24:10.833
There's nothing I can do
to make you change your mind?

24:11.500 --> 24:12.833
Absolutely not.

24:12.900 --> 24:15.833
As your banking executive, I
strongly urge you to reconsider

24:15.900 --> 24:18.733
withdrawing the entire
20 million dollars.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.133
I've made up my mind, Herman.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.966
Then it's all yours.

24:24.033 --> 24:25.566
Thank you, Herman.

24:25.633 --> 24:28.366
I'll send you a postcard
from Rio.

24:28.433 --> 24:31.566
If you ever decide
to move back to Springwood--

24:31.633 --> 24:34.200
You'll be the first person
that I call.

24:50.166 --> 24:53.733
That Greta, she's some
kinda dame.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.566
She's killed so many guys by now

24:55.633 --> 24:58.100
I'm getting kinda jealous.

24:58.166 --> 24:59.300
But you know..

24:59.366 --> 25:02.033
...there's one thing
I got she don't have.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.533
My good looks.

25:10.266 --> 25:11.233
Hello.

25:11.300 --> 25:13.133
'Mrs. Moss, this is Diane Tracy'

25:13.200 --> 25:14.633
'at the Springwood
travel agency.'

25:14.700 --> 25:15.700
Yes.

25:15.766 --> 25:17.466
'I've got some
bad news, Mrs. Moss.'

25:17.533 --> 25:18.733
'The flight you were booked
on..'

25:18.800 --> 25:20.600
'...one-way to Rio de Janeiro
with a connection'

25:20.666 --> 25:23.333
'through Miami,
has been cancelled.'

25:23.400 --> 25:26.000
Don't tell me
I'm stuck here in Springwood.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.166
'Just until morning.'

25:27.233 --> 25:28.500
'I've gone ahead
and confirmed you'

25:28.566 --> 25:29.800
'on our first flight tomorrow.'

25:29.866 --> 25:31.233
'Would that be alright?'

25:31.300 --> 25:32.566
No, but it doesn't look
as though I've got

25:32.633 --> 25:34.200
much choice does it?

25:34.266 --> 25:35.500
'Check-in time is 8:00 a.m.'

25:35.566 --> 25:37.300
'I apologize
for the inconvenience.'

25:37.366 --> 25:39.533
'Have a pleasant trip,
Mrs. Moss.'

25:40.200 --> 25:41.600
Thanks a lot.

25:50.800 --> 25:54.000
- Who is it?
- 'Will you let me in already?'

25:55.366 --> 25:57.266
- Peggy?
- Hi, sis.

26:01.066 --> 26:02.400
You look terrific.

26:02.466 --> 26:03.833
So do you.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.733
I'd almost forgotten
what you look like.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.033
It's been such a long time,
since I've seen you.

26:08.100 --> 26:11.433
I know.
Since mom and dad died.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.566
Well, what are you doing here?

26:13.633 --> 26:15.366
Well, we were just passing
through Springwood

26:15.433 --> 26:17.900
and I thought
that we should see you.

26:17.966 --> 26:20.133
Who's we?

26:20.200 --> 26:21.233
Uh-oh.

26:22.066 --> 26:24.100
- Sonny.
- 'Greta.'

26:26.766 --> 26:28.700
I knew she'd be surprised.

26:28.766 --> 26:30.066
You'll never guess
what happened.

26:30.133 --> 26:31.333
Never in a million years.

26:31.400 --> 26:34.000
Sonny and I got married.

26:34.066 --> 26:36.533
'I hadn't seen him
since you guys stopped dating.'

26:36.600 --> 26:38.466
Then two weeks ago,
we ran into each other.

26:38.533 --> 26:41.666
And the rest is...history.

26:41.733 --> 26:42.733
History.

26:44.133 --> 26:47.566
It all happened so fast,
it feels like a dream.

26:47.633 --> 26:50.066
I guess that's what
love feels like.

26:50.133 --> 26:51.433
I think so.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.533
- A dream.
- Hmm.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.433
Can I use your bathroom?

27:06.500 --> 27:08.833
Sonny wouldn't stop
at a gas station.

27:08.900 --> 27:10.700
Well, that's because, uh,
we didn't need gas.

27:14.433 --> 27:15.633
Ah.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.333
It's, uh, just pass the kitchen.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.133
- I'll be right back.
- Uh-huh.

27:24.966 --> 27:26.033
So?

27:26.700 --> 27:27.700
So..

27:29.100 --> 27:30.733
So buttons.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.233
Oh, this is lovely.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.933
Very, very...nice.

27:38.366 --> 27:42.000
You know, I especially
like the, uh...the white.

27:42.066 --> 27:43.933
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27:45.300 --> 27:47.200
So what's it like
to win the lottery? Hmm?

27:47.266 --> 27:48.633
Must be great?

27:48.700 --> 27:50.433
Somebody up there
likes you, Greta.

27:51.566 --> 27:53.300
Let's cut
the small talks, Sonny.

27:53.366 --> 27:55.766
What are you doing here?
Why did you marry my sister?

27:55.833 --> 27:57.200
Hi, honey.

27:59.100 --> 28:01.233
Where's your new husband?

28:01.300 --> 28:04.433
I'm just dying to meet..

28:04.500 --> 28:05.566
What's his name?

28:05.633 --> 28:07.200
Gene?

28:07.266 --> 28:08.466
Eugene.

28:08.533 --> 28:10.666
'He's on vacation in Brazil.'

28:10.733 --> 28:12.566
I'm joining him tomorrow.

28:12.633 --> 28:14.966
- Tomorrow?
- 'I'm sorry, Peggy.'

28:15.033 --> 28:17.566
You should have called
and told me you were coming.

28:17.633 --> 28:20.633
I wish we could have had
some more time together.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.300
That's okay.
We've got to get back.

28:24.100 --> 28:25.833
Sonny's got a trial coming up.

28:26.533 --> 28:27.500
Really?

28:27.566 --> 28:29.200
What are the charges this time?

28:30.266 --> 28:32.200
That's good. That's good.

28:32.266 --> 28:34.966
'Now, you see,
I'm an attorney now.'

28:35.033 --> 28:37.766
If you ever, uh,
need any legal advice.

28:37.833 --> 28:39.233
'I'm your man.'

28:41.800 --> 28:45.300
You know I just realized that
the guest bedroom isn't made up.

28:45.366 --> 28:46.666
I wasn't expecting company.

28:46.733 --> 28:49.400
So, why don't I call
the Springwood hotel

28:49.466 --> 28:51.100
it's very close.

28:51.166 --> 28:52.800
Don't be silly.

28:52.866 --> 28:55.066
I came here
to be with you, Greta.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.600
'I'm not gonna stay
in some crummy ol' hotel.'

28:59.400 --> 29:02.133
We've got our sleeping bags
in the Jeep.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.066
We could crash out on the floor.

29:05.133 --> 29:08.500
Or we could sleep outside
under the stars.

29:10.366 --> 29:12.133
'Wouldn't that be romantic?'

29:12.766 --> 29:14.100
Romantic.

29:19.400 --> 29:22.533
Well, I'll let you two
get settled.

29:25.166 --> 29:26.233
Uh.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.033
Greta, wait!

29:32.100 --> 29:33.300
When you get upstairs

29:33.366 --> 29:35.866
I want you to take off
all your clothes

29:35.933 --> 29:38.833
'and get ready for 30 minutes
of earthly delight.'

29:38.900 --> 29:41.300
Peggy, what are you
talking about?

29:41.366 --> 29:44.400
I took a massage course
at the Buddha Center.

29:44.466 --> 29:46.433
Sonny says I'm the best.

29:52.866 --> 29:55.333
Hello, Sally, it's Greta Moss.

29:56.333 --> 29:58.666
Listen my flight was cancelled.

29:58.733 --> 30:01.133
I know, I'm so depressed.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.800
'Do you think,
that the new owners would mind'

30:02.866 --> 30:05.766
'if I stayed one more night
here at the house?'

30:05.833 --> 30:07.666
Great. Yeah, I'm leaving
first thing in the morning.

30:07.733 --> 30:09.233
I'll drop the keys off
at the escrow company

30:09.300 --> 30:10.666
on my way to the airport.

30:10.733 --> 30:12.100
Thanks, Sally.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.966
Hi.

30:16.033 --> 30:19.100
You sister, uh, asked me
to set this up for you.

30:20.266 --> 30:22.800
Then do it...and get out.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.333
Ooh.

30:33.800 --> 30:35.433
Fireplace.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.933
Yeah, this is nice. You're doing
just fine, aren't you?

30:41.466 --> 30:42.800
I like it here.

30:42.866 --> 30:44.166
Thank you.

30:44.233 --> 30:46.366
So how come you're selling
the house?

30:46.433 --> 30:48.700
'I mean, I couldn't help
but over hear.'

30:48.766 --> 30:50.300
Downstairs you said
you were going on vacation.

30:50.366 --> 30:52.100
Now you're selling your house.

30:52.166 --> 30:53.633
What's it to you, Sonny?

30:53.700 --> 30:55.466
Uh, nothing, just, uh..

30:55.533 --> 30:56.700
...asking questions.

30:56.766 --> 30:58.366
'No you weren't.'

30:58.433 --> 30:59.466
'I can see right through you'

30:59.533 --> 31:01.200
don't try and fool me.

31:01.266 --> 31:02.600
All you are trying
to do is figure out

31:02.666 --> 31:04.633
how to get your hands
on my money.

31:04.700 --> 31:06.366
Ouch.

31:06.433 --> 31:09.200
It's a pretty serious
accusation, isn't it, Greta?

31:09.266 --> 31:11.766
It's true and you know it.

31:11.833 --> 31:14.066
'But there's one other thing
you should know, Sonny.'

31:14.133 --> 31:16.600
You never gonna get your hands
on one penny of my money.

31:16.666 --> 31:17.766
Never.

31:17.833 --> 31:19.733
Now, you listen to me.

31:20.733 --> 31:23.000
I never wanted a thing from you.

31:23.066 --> 31:24.566
'Despite what you did to me'

31:24.633 --> 31:27.400
I never wanted a damn thing!

31:27.466 --> 31:30.133
The only reason I'm here
is because of your sister!

31:31.100 --> 31:32.366
'And if it was up to me'

31:32.433 --> 31:35.966
I wouldn't lay my eyes
on you for the rest of my life!

31:36.033 --> 31:38.300
You got that?

31:38.366 --> 31:39.433
Ugh.

31:42.266 --> 31:43.900
You're welcome.

31:49.100 --> 31:51.033
Sonny. Sonny.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.133
- Sonny.
- What?

31:54.066 --> 31:55.133
What's the matter with you? Huh?

31:55.200 --> 31:57.133
You gotta have the blisters
on your lips again?

31:57.200 --> 31:59.933
No, Sonny, look,
I-I gotta talk to you.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.033
So talk.

32:01.100 --> 32:02.100
Well, it's-it's-it's just

32:02.166 --> 32:03.766
not-not that easy. I..

32:03.833 --> 32:05.233
What's the matter?
Is it that time of the month?

32:05.300 --> 32:06.700
No.

32:06.766 --> 32:08.066
Look, I-I've gotta be honest
with you

32:08.133 --> 32:10.033
I-I've done a lot
of thinkin' and--

32:10.100 --> 32:12.766
What, you, you have done
a lot of thinkin'?

32:12.833 --> 32:14.833
- Yes
- Okay.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.800
And I think
that it's time that..

32:16.866 --> 32:19.033
...that we...that..

32:19.100 --> 32:21.100
...that we stop seeing
so much of each other.

32:22.533 --> 32:24.733
Look-look at me. Look at me.
Look at me!

32:24.800 --> 32:27.000
Are you telling me you
wanna break up just like that?

32:27.066 --> 32:28.700
Well, I-I didn't say
that we should break up--

32:28.766 --> 32:30.100
Greta, Greta,
you and me, you and me

32:30.166 --> 32:31.800
we've been going together
since high school.

32:31.866 --> 32:33.333
What-what all of a sudden
I don't mean squat?

32:33.400 --> 32:35.266
All of a sudden
you're gonna dump me?

32:35.333 --> 32:37.333
Um? No, no. No.

32:38.566 --> 32:39.900
Greta, you're..

32:39.966 --> 32:41.900
you're-you're my woman.

32:41.966 --> 32:42.900
You're my little girl.

32:42.966 --> 32:44.466
You're-you're-you're
my princess.

32:44.533 --> 32:46.300
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

32:46.366 --> 32:47.900
- You wanna bet--
- No, I'm not! Sonny.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.600
God.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.233
Oh, God! I'm gonna get you.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.700
I'm gonna get you for this,
Greta!

33:01.300 --> 33:03.600
You have a lot of tension, sis.

33:06.700 --> 33:09.300
Where is all this stress
coming from?

33:17.866 --> 33:20.033
- Anyone want anymore?
- No.

33:20.100 --> 33:21.866
Good.

33:21.933 --> 33:24.233
I'm gonna save it for tomorrow.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.833
I love cold pizza for breakfast.

33:28.533 --> 33:29.733
Ooh.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.066
Excuse me. Excuse me.&nbsp;
Pardon moi.

33:33.133 --> 33:35.133
I'm going upstairs.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.100
I hope you get
that mess cleaned up.

33:44.833 --> 33:47.633
Honey. Honey!

33:47.700 --> 33:48.633
What happened?

33:48.700 --> 33:51.066
Uh, I spilled beer here.

33:51.133 --> 33:53.966
- Oh, let me get that.
- Thanks.

33:54.033 --> 33:56.066
You go wash your hands.

33:56.133 --> 33:58.333
I don't want you all sticky.

33:59.866 --> 34:01.733
Right.

34:01.800 --> 34:02.800
Ah.

34:06.333 --> 34:08.266
Where's Greta?

34:08.333 --> 34:10.866
Uh, she went upstairs.
What's that?

34:10.933 --> 34:13.533
- I'm not sure.
- 'Let me see.'

34:23.000 --> 34:24.733
- Yes.
- What is it, honey?

34:24.800 --> 34:27.066
Come here, come here.
Sit on my lap.

34:27.133 --> 34:29.700
- Sure.
- Give us a kiss, huh?

34:32.066 --> 34:33.133
That's enough.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.633
- 'You decent?'
- Yes.

34:48.500 --> 34:51.700
Look, I, uh, found
this downstairs on the floor.

34:51.766 --> 34:53.100
Seems to be some kind
of bank re..

34:54.200 --> 34:55.600
Thank you.

34:56.733 --> 34:59.633
Goodnight, Sonny.
Sweet dreams.

34:59.700 --> 35:01.700
It's cold tonight, isn't it, hm?

35:01.766 --> 35:02.966
I was thinking maybe I could

35:03.033 --> 35:04.800
borrow a pair
of Eugene's pajama--

35:04.866 --> 35:06.766
No.

35:06.833 --> 35:09.533
He took all of his clothes
with him on vacation.

35:09.600 --> 35:10.900
You know, it's funny
you should bring that up.

35:10.966 --> 35:12.400
I called the airlines

35:12.466 --> 35:14.266
and they've never heard
of a Eugene Moss

35:14.333 --> 35:16.266
flying anywhere
in last six months.

35:16.333 --> 35:17.733
I see you're selling your house.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.766
You've taken money
out of the bank

35:19.833 --> 35:21.333
and your husband disappeared.

35:21.400 --> 35:22.633
What the hell's
going on here, Greta?

35:22.700 --> 35:25.833
I told you, Sonny,
stay out of my face.

35:40.900 --> 35:42.533
Yes.

37:55.066 --> 37:57.433
'Open the door.'

37:57.500 --> 37:59.533
'I swear, Greta,
if you don't open this door'

37:59.600 --> 38:01.733
'then I'll knock it down.'

38:13.833 --> 38:16.633
I hate to bother you, but, uh..

38:16.700 --> 38:18.733
...I'm having trouble sleeping.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.500
I keep thinking
about you and me.

38:20.566 --> 38:22.200
What do you want, Sonny?

38:22.266 --> 38:23.266
What do I want?

38:27.266 --> 38:29.366
What do I want?
I want the money.

38:29.433 --> 38:31.066
Every last red cent.

38:31.133 --> 38:32.866
And I know you got it stashed
in the briefcase.

38:32.933 --> 38:34.633
Are you out of your mind?

38:34.700 --> 38:35.866
You owe me, lady.

38:35.933 --> 38:37.766
I owe you? You tried to rape me.

38:39.533 --> 38:42.366
Well, if that's your attitude,
uh, why don't we call the cops?

38:42.433 --> 38:44.800
Let 'em check out
what's in the basement.

38:45.866 --> 38:48.366
Oh-oh!

38:48.433 --> 38:50.766
I'll kill myself before
I let you have any of money.

38:50.833 --> 38:53.000
Great. Great idea.

38:53.066 --> 38:55.733
Then as your only living
relative, my wife

38:55.800 --> 38:57.800
we get it all.

39:01.566 --> 39:04.500
Okay...I'll let you have half.

39:04.566 --> 39:06.500
This is not a negotiation.
I want the money.

39:06.566 --> 39:09.000
- I can't.
- 'Why not?'

39:09.066 --> 39:11.433
Because I buried it outside,
it's too dark.

39:11.500 --> 39:14.866
It's too dark.
It's too dark.

39:14.933 --> 39:17.366
Great.

39:17.433 --> 39:19.600
Then I guess you and I..

39:19.666 --> 39:21.266
...are gonna spend
the night together.

39:21.333 --> 39:22.366
Forget it, Sonny.

39:22.433 --> 39:23.500
Oh, what, you think
I'm gonna let you

39:23.566 --> 39:25.433
out of my sight
until I get this money?

39:25.500 --> 39:26.900
No.

39:26.966 --> 39:28.533
Now, it's my turn.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.133
Sweet dreams, baby.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.033
Got you.

40:29.533 --> 40:31.700
- Oh-oh.
- Sonny.

40:31.766 --> 40:32.866
Sonny.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.800
Trying to pull a fast one,
aren't you, Greta?

40:37.866 --> 40:39.800
No, I..

40:39.866 --> 40:41.933
Bad move.

40:43.033 --> 40:45.833
Greta, Greta, Greta..

40:50.600 --> 40:52.166
You owe me one.

40:52.233 --> 40:53.766
Here.

40:53.833 --> 40:56.433
Sonny...take it.

40:56.500 --> 40:57.900
It's all the money
that I've got, I swear.

40:57.966 --> 41:00.733
Money.
I don't want your damn money!

41:00.800 --> 41:02.100
I don't want money!

41:02.166 --> 41:04.100
What do you want?

41:04.166 --> 41:06.600
What do I want?

41:09.600 --> 41:11.933
An eye for an eye.

41:15.333 --> 41:17.033
'Hey, wake up.'

41:18.733 --> 41:20.100
You're having a dream.

41:20.166 --> 41:21.733
I'm fine.

41:22.900 --> 41:25.333
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

41:30.033 --> 41:31.400
What?

41:37.933 --> 41:40.700
I've been staying here
wondering if, uh..

41:42.166 --> 41:44.600
...she still slept&lt;i

41:46.966 --> 41:49.600
Well, I guess, now it's your big
chance to find out.

41:50.933 --> 41:53.033
Right.

41:53.100 --> 41:55.300
Oh, come on, Sonny.

41:55.366 --> 41:57.600
Are you afraid
to come to bed with me?

42:01.033 --> 42:03.000
Do I have to beg?

43:01.666 --> 43:02.833
'What was that?'

43:09.400 --> 43:11.033
Oh, my God.

43:12.900 --> 43:14.600
You killed him.

43:15.800 --> 43:18.300
- Uh--
- You killed my husband.

43:20.233 --> 43:21.900
How could you do this to me?

43:21.966 --> 43:23.733
I hate you, Greta.
I hate you!

43:23.800 --> 43:25.300
Listen, Peggy.

43:25.366 --> 43:26.900
Sonny didn't love you,
he-he was just

43:26.966 --> 43:28.566
using you to get to my money.

43:28.633 --> 43:30.066
No, I'm calling the police

43:30.133 --> 43:31.500
No!

43:31.566 --> 43:34.233
We don't need the police.

43:34.300 --> 43:36.400
You really think you can
get away with murder?

43:36.466 --> 43:38.000
Yes.

43:39.233 --> 43:42.333
And I'll give you half my money
if you help me.

43:43.400 --> 43:46.200
Ten million dollars, Peggy.

43:48.766 --> 43:51.200
Ten million dollars?

43:52.300 --> 43:54.100
How?

43:54.166 --> 43:57.500
Well, I've already killed two
husbands and a brother-in-law.

43:57.566 --> 43:59.633
I can handle one more.

43:59.700 --> 44:02.600
You really killed four people?

44:03.966 --> 44:05.700
Yeah.

44:06.866 --> 44:08.900
Wow.

44:08.966 --> 44:11.400
It must run in the family.

44:12.600 --> 44:13.833
What?

44:15.833 --> 44:18.033
I killed mom and dad.

44:20.500 --> 44:23.566
At first, it was hard dealing
with the loss.

44:23.633 --> 44:24.933
I really missed them.

44:27.533 --> 44:29.800
I guess it's like that
with family.

44:33.633 --> 44:36.400
I'm gonna miss you too, Greta.

44:51.833 --> 44:53.733
Easy come..

44:54.700 --> 44:56.833
...easy go.

45:03.066 --> 45:04.433
Tha-th-th-th..

45:04.500 --> 45:06.333
That's all folks.
