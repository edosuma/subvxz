00:04.168 --> 00:06.668
(tense music)

00:11.758 --> 00:14.841
(indistinct chatter)

00:42.739 --> 00:43.572
- Ball four.

00:43.572 --> 00:46.905
(cheering and applause)

01:00.369 --> 01:03.358
(cheering and applause)

01:03.358 --> 01:04.738
- [Umpire] Out!

01:04.738 --> 01:05.571
- Safe!

01:05.571 --> 01:07.929
- Nice play, Jimmy, nice play!

01:07.929 --> 01:08.780
Woo!

01:08.780 --> 01:10.407
Alright, one more out.

01:10.407 --> 01:11.990
One more, let's go!

01:15.038 --> 01:17.538
(tense music)

01:18.489 --> 01:19.322
- Oh boy.

01:22.758 --> 01:23.591
- Blue.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.756
Outfield, keep it in front of you.

01:28.756 --> 01:33.756
Alright, let's go.

01:39.086 --> 01:42.419
(cheering and applause)

01:58.404 --> 02:01.737
(cheering and applause)

02:07.272 --> 02:09.772
(crowd gasps)

02:17.112 --> 02:18.991
(cheering and applause)

02:18.991 --> 02:20.692
(players celebrate)

02:20.692 --> 02:24.025
(cheering and applause)

02:27.871 --> 02:30.209
- No, he's okay, he's okay.

02:30.209 --> 02:33.777
(cheering and applause)

02:33.777 --> 02:37.110
(cheering and applause)

02:43.177 --> 02:46.177
(players celebrate)

02:53.325 --> 02:54.766
- You okay?

02:54.766 --> 02:56.619
- I should've caught it.

02:56.619 --> 02:58.185
- You gave it everything you could.

02:58.185 --> 02:59.305
(soft music)

02:59.305 --> 03:00.505
- I should've caught it.

03:04.159 --> 03:05.693
- We're really gonna
miss you next year, Kyle.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.463
I wish every one of my kids
played with your heart.

03:11.050 --> 03:13.493
Just remember me when you
get to the majors, alright?

03:16.040 --> 03:17.897
- [Announcer] Congratulations
to the 10-year-old All-Stars

03:17.897 --> 03:21.070
and state champions from
Brookville, Massachusetts.

03:21.070 --> 03:25.237
Final score: Brookville
eight, Princeton seven.

03:25.237 --> 03:27.654
Good luck at regionals, boys.

03:32.609 --> 03:35.026
(soft music)

03:54.010 --> 03:55.010
- I think that's it.

03:58.790 --> 04:00.809
So what do you think?

04:00.809 --> 04:02.710
- I mean, the yard's a lot
smaller than our other house.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.360
- Ah, it's not that much smaller.

04:05.340 --> 04:06.890
You wanna test it out?

04:06.890 --> 04:08.070
- Right now?

04:08.070 --> 04:09.349
- Yeah.

04:09.349 --> 04:10.182
Huh?

04:15.270 --> 04:16.140
So listen, Kyle,

04:16.140 --> 04:18.200
I know moving's not the
easiest thing for you,

04:18.200 --> 04:21.643
but I think we're really
gonna like it here.

04:27.939 --> 04:28.772
But guess what,

04:28.772 --> 04:30.960
I was talking to some
of the dads I work with,

04:30.960 --> 04:34.690
they said our 10s and 11s won
states two years in a row.

04:34.690 --> 04:38.670
And our 12s went to the World Series.

04:38.670 --> 04:39.503
- [Kyle] Really?

04:39.503 --> 04:40.336
- Yeah.

04:40.336 --> 04:41.913
- Do you think I could
make the all-star team?

04:44.260 --> 04:46.340
- Yeah, I think you probably have

04:46.340 --> 04:48.090
just as good a shot as anybody.

04:52.330 --> 04:54.863
Alright, let's see that heater.

04:55.930 --> 04:56.770
- Dad.

04:56.770 --> 04:59.463
- Come on, just one,
keep up your accuracy.

05:05.073 --> 05:07.490
(soft music)

05:11.910 --> 05:12.743
Good pitch.

05:24.060 --> 05:25.220
Hey, babe.

05:25.220 --> 05:26.053
- Hey.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.160
How you doing with everything?

05:29.160 --> 05:29.993
- Alright.

05:32.710 --> 05:33.660
One step at a time.

05:34.859 --> 05:36.776
- That's all we can do.

05:45.123 --> 05:47.611
- Hey, buddy, how's the unpacking going?

05:47.611 --> 05:48.444
- Good.

05:48.444 --> 05:50.410
- Good, you wanna take a break,

05:50.410 --> 05:51.980
go play catch with your brother?

05:51.980 --> 05:52.850
- Not really.

05:52.850 --> 05:56.060
- Ah, come on, he'd love to
make the travel team here.

05:56.060 --> 05:58.330
Besides, you should work
out some of that rust too,

05:58.330 --> 06:00.860
you can't just waltz onto varsity here.

06:00.860 --> 06:01.730
- Coach already called though

06:01.730 --> 06:03.840
and said he's excited
for me to be on the team.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.000
- Yeah, but you have to prove
to him that you can play.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.210
- He was at regionals

06:07.210 --> 06:09.220
when I threw that no-hitter
against New Jersey.

06:09.220 --> 06:11.860
- [Ted] Xavier, there's more
to the game than pitching.

06:11.860 --> 06:14.090
- I went three for four with two homers.

06:14.090 --> 06:17.130
Anyways, I think it's time I
start focusing more on girls

06:17.130 --> 06:19.790
and a little bit less on baseball.

06:19.790 --> 06:21.570
- Yeah, why don't you sit down and relax

06:21.570 --> 06:23.577
until that feeling goes away

06:23.577 --> 06:25.403
and then go practice with Kyle.

06:26.900 --> 06:27.733
- Hey, Dad,

06:28.610 --> 06:30.877
you know, now that we're
in this new town and all,

06:30.877 --> 06:33.083
I'm really trying to
move away from Xavier.

06:34.490 --> 06:37.977
So if you could just, like, call me X.

06:37.977 --> 06:38.966
- [Ted] X?

06:38.966 --> 06:40.528
- Yeah,

06:40.528 --> 06:43.233
X.

06:43.233 --> 06:44.393
Dad, Dad, seriously.

06:44.393 --> 06:45.583
Dad, come on.

06:48.767 --> 06:50.369
(upbeat music)

06:50.369 --> 06:52.786
(bell rings)

07:04.390 --> 07:06.210
- Hey, Mr. Howard.

07:06.210 --> 07:07.060
- How's it going?

07:08.956 --> 07:10.490
- Here you go.

07:10.490 --> 07:11.363
- Thank you.

07:12.690 --> 07:14.170
- Yeah, right there.

07:14.170 --> 07:17.083
Alright, class, settle down, settle down.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.170
Welcome back.

07:20.170 --> 07:22.560
Hope everyone had a nice spring break.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.603
Did anyone do anything interesting?

07:25.590 --> 07:27.690
- I went to the Kennedy Space Center.

07:27.690 --> 07:28.610
- That's cool, Billy,

07:28.610 --> 07:30.214
did you get a good look Uranus?

07:30.214 --> 07:33.973
- Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
very funny, Glenn, grow up.

07:34.950 --> 07:36.160
Alright, class, listen,

07:36.160 --> 07:38.550
we have a new student in our homeroom,

07:38.550 --> 07:42.113
so please welcome, boom, Xavier Cooke.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.783
Come on, come on up.

07:47.137 --> 07:47.987
Come on, come on.

07:49.020 --> 07:51.463
So do you pronounce it
Zay-vier or X-avier?

07:52.570 --> 07:56.550
- Uh, it's Zay-vier, but,
uh, everyone just calls me X,

07:56.550 --> 07:57.383
so that's what I go by.

07:57.383 --> 07:58.216
- [Mr. Howard] X?

07:58.216 --> 07:59.049
- [Xavier] Yeah.

07:59.049 --> 08:01.520
- Alright, so how did you
spend your spring break?

08:01.520 --> 08:03.010
- A lot of unpacking

08:03.010 --> 08:05.923
and played a little
baseball with the guys.

08:06.997 --> 08:08.230
- Oh, so you're the new pitcher

08:08.230 --> 08:09.860
Coach Barrett's been crowing about?

08:09.860 --> 08:10.693
- Yeah, yeah, that's me.

08:10.693 --> 08:12.420
- Okay, well, hey, welcome to our school.

08:12.420 --> 08:13.253
- Thank you.

08:13.253 --> 08:14.086
- Yeah.

08:14.086 --> 08:17.250
Listen, if you have any questions
about your class schedule,

08:17.250 --> 08:18.360
come talk to me.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.193
Okay?

08:19.193 --> 08:21.450
Glenn, see me after class.

08:21.450 --> 08:23.650
No, matter of fact, go
stand in the corner.

08:23.650 --> 08:25.073
Always telling jokes.

08:26.280 --> 08:28.398
I'm not playing, boy,
go stand in the corner.

08:28.398 --> 08:31.409
(upbeat music)

08:31.409 --> 08:33.826
(bell rings)

08:35.210 --> 08:36.760
- Hey, do you know where, uh...

08:38.630 --> 08:39.463
- X?

08:41.200 --> 08:42.820
X?

08:42.820 --> 08:44.060
- Hi.
- Hi,

08:44.060 --> 08:46.330
do you know where you're going?

08:46.330 --> 08:47.600
- Not really.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.350
- Here, let me see.

08:49.350 --> 08:53.430
Oh, room 139 is actually
in the annex building,

08:53.430 --> 08:55.350
that's about two blocks away.

08:55.350 --> 08:56.328
- What?

08:56.328 --> 08:57.740
- (chuckles) I'm only kidding.

08:57.740 --> 08:59.330
Just down the hall.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.340
Miss Bartone is great too.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.830
You got lucky.

09:02.830 --> 09:04.210
- Thank you...

09:04.210 --> 09:05.480
- Brooke.

09:05.480 --> 09:07.410
- Brooke, thank you, Brooke.

09:07.410 --> 09:08.910
You're like my guardian angel.

09:11.850 --> 09:14.400
- Try to snap your wrists
through a little earlier.

09:15.748 --> 09:16.980
That's it.

09:16.980 --> 09:19.280
- Dad, can I get a new bat this year?

09:19.280 --> 09:20.810
- That one's still got some pop in it.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.360
- It's old, Xavier used it for two years.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.773
- Come on, back to hitting.

09:27.100 --> 09:27.933
Nice.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.640
Hey, you must be Rick?

09:33.640 --> 09:34.473
- Yeah.

09:34.473 --> 09:36.960
- I sent you an email about my son Kyle.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.417
- Oh, yeah, Tim, right?

09:38.417 --> 09:41.830
- Uh, I wish, Ted, Ted Cooke.

09:41.830 --> 09:43.130
- Kyle, how you doing, buddy?

09:43.130 --> 09:43.963
- Good.

09:43.963 --> 09:45.900
- I'm Coach Rick, this is Max.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.030
You ready to play some ball?

09:47.030 --> 09:47.863
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

09:47.863 --> 09:48.696
- Always, Coach.

09:48.696 --> 09:50.260
- Why don't you, uh, head out to short?

09:50.260 --> 09:51.560
Max, you wanna play first?

10:01.881 --> 10:03.120
Has he played much ball?

10:03.120 --> 10:05.593
- Oh, yeah, he's been
playing since he was four.

10:09.690 --> 10:11.695
- What, uh, what positions?

10:11.695 --> 10:13.110
- Uh, just about anywhere.

10:13.110 --> 10:14.620
He played center and short

10:14.620 --> 10:17.340
on the city all-star team last year.

10:17.340 --> 10:18.173
- Yeah?

10:20.210 --> 10:21.620
How'd you guys do?

10:21.620 --> 10:25.000
- Uh, runner-up in states, Massachusetts.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.250
- Right.

10:26.250 --> 10:30.150
We beat that Mass team
in regionals last year.

10:30.150 --> 10:32.100
Kyle, why don't you head out to center?

10:33.370 --> 10:38.130
It's a big commitment,
you know, all-star teams.

10:38.130 --> 10:43.070
Travel, hotel rooms, maybe
flights, it gets expensive.

10:43.070 --> 10:43.903
- Hmm.

10:47.020 --> 10:47.853
- Got it.

10:50.340 --> 10:52.053
- Hey, buddy, put some zip on it.

11:01.040 --> 11:01.913
- Wow!

11:03.500 --> 11:04.680
He's got a cannon.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.350
- Yeah.
- Does he pitch?

11:06.350 --> 11:09.143
- Nah, he doesn't really like to pitch.

11:09.985 --> 11:10.818
- Really?

11:13.750 --> 11:15.100
- [Kyle] That's a cool shirt.

11:15.100 --> 11:17.350
- Thanks, it's the
all-stars practice jersey.

11:18.410 --> 11:19.663
We're the Bats, get it?

11:21.720 --> 11:23.820
- How many kids tried out?

11:23.820 --> 11:26.730
- Like 30, but only 12 of us made it.

11:26.730 --> 11:28.726
Eight kids are really good,

11:28.726 --> 11:31.686
and then four spots go
to the coaches' kids.

11:31.686 --> 11:33.756
(sighs) You look like you're
good enough to make it

11:33.756 --> 11:35.084
if a spot opens up.

11:35.084 --> 11:36.140
- Oh, you're up.

11:36.140 --> 11:36.973
- Oh, thanks.

11:41.080 --> 11:44.467
- Hey, hon, how was today?

11:44.467 --> 11:46.263
- It was alright.

11:47.300 --> 11:48.993
Kinda weird to be selling again.

11:50.420 --> 11:53.810
I mean, I'm 40 and I'm
back doing the same job

11:53.810 --> 11:55.730
as when I got outta college.

11:55.730 --> 11:59.003
- Except by my calculations,
you're actually 42.

12:00.660 --> 12:02.830
Well, Kyle had a great time at practice,

12:02.830 --> 12:04.060
he really likes the new team.

12:04.060 --> 12:05.010
- Good.

12:05.010 --> 12:06.780
Uh, what's up with Xavier?

12:06.780 --> 12:09.340
- Oh, you mean X?

12:09.340 --> 12:12.060
I am not allowed to
call him Xavier anymore,

12:12.060 --> 12:15.100
and I heard him on the phone with a girl.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.510
- Dad, check it out.

12:17.510 --> 12:19.710
- [Ted] Hey, nice uni, bud.

12:19.710 --> 12:21.900
- And the best part...

12:21.900 --> 12:23.490
- Oh, you got your number?

12:23.490 --> 12:24.640
Nice.

12:24.640 --> 12:25.473
- Yeah,

12:25.473 --> 12:26.830
but AJ said another kid
on the all-star team

12:26.830 --> 12:28.030
already has seven,

12:28.030 --> 12:29.740
so I have to think of a new one for that.

12:29.740 --> 12:33.260
- Well, let's, uh, let's
make the team first,

12:33.260 --> 12:34.963
then we can worry about a number.

12:35.810 --> 12:37.420
- Oh, and our first game is against

12:37.420 --> 12:38.810
the coach of the all-star team.

12:38.810 --> 12:39.643
- Well, that's good,

12:39.643 --> 12:42.711
let's get practicing, show
him what you got, huh?

12:42.711 --> 12:43.544
Hmm?

12:49.671 --> 12:53.004
(cheering and applause)

12:58.030 --> 12:58.863
- Out!

12:58.863 --> 12:59.696
- Jason!

13:00.830 --> 13:03.430
You gotta make that catch!

13:03.430 --> 13:05.380
Take the piano off your back and hustle

13:05.380 --> 13:07.430
or you won't play another game this year!

13:10.181 --> 13:11.981
- Hey, good try, buddy, good effort.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.290
- How's the team?

13:23.290 --> 13:24.410
- Pretty good,

13:24.410 --> 13:27.390
and we picked up a new
kid that can really play.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.797
- Is he better than my
speed demon in right?

13:29.797 --> 13:32.390
(Rick scoffs)

13:32.390 --> 13:33.450
Who?

13:33.450 --> 13:34.283
- Short.

13:36.340 --> 13:37.720
- Well, I only got one spot left,

13:37.720 --> 13:39.880
and I think I'm gonna
give it to Murray's kid.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.295
- Really?

13:41.295 --> 13:42.245
- He ain't too bad.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.143
His old man hired us to put
an addition on his house.

13:47.610 --> 13:48.443
- Man, I don't know,

13:48.443 --> 13:50.040
we might wanna give this new kid a shot.

13:53.660 --> 13:56.083
- Come on, Mase, let's
put one in play now!

14:00.135 --> 14:03.870
(cheering and applause)

14:03.870 --> 14:04.783
Nice hit, buddy!

14:06.735 --> 14:08.902
- [Player] That was a hit?

14:17.294 --> 14:18.127
(cheering and applause)
- Dig in, dig in deep,

14:18.127 --> 14:18.960
come on now!

14:20.100 --> 14:21.760
Nice running, Mase!

14:21.760 --> 14:23.703
Okay, Traver, let's let it rip!

14:24.728 --> 14:25.895
- [Mason] Dad!

14:39.080 --> 14:39.913
(cheering and applause)

14:39.913 --> 14:41.913
- [Umpire] Batter's out!

14:42.960 --> 14:44.410
- First base, throw to first.

14:46.284 --> 14:47.822
- [Umpire] He's outta there!

14:47.822 --> 14:50.810
(cheering and applause)

14:50.810 --> 14:52.923
- Great toss, Kyle, great throw.

14:54.260 --> 14:59.010
- Hey, don't get too excited,
kid, that was all luck.

14:59.010 --> 15:00.520
- That was pretty good.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.150
I mean, just another triple play, but...

15:03.150 --> 15:04.393
Way to go, team!

15:06.760 --> 15:10.230
- Dad, I wanna go to tryouts
an hour early tomorrow

15:10.230 --> 15:11.400
so we can warm up.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.290
- Well, I don't know about an hour, buddy.

15:13.290 --> 15:15.060
- Well, can we go practice
grounders now then?

15:15.060 --> 15:16.000
- Kyle, relax,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.813
your mother and I are taking
care of some things right now.

15:21.900 --> 15:22.733
- I need money.

15:23.970 --> 15:25.690
- Oh, hi.

15:25.690 --> 15:26.800
How was practice?

15:26.800 --> 15:27.890
- It was awesome.

15:27.890 --> 15:30.210
We're naming the pitching
rotation the X-Men,

15:30.210 --> 15:31.450
and instead of using a K,

15:31.450 --> 15:33.380
we're using an X to mark strikeouts.

15:33.380 --> 15:34.420
- Really?

15:34.420 --> 15:36.230
So how do you write a backwards X

15:36.230 --> 15:38.360
if someone gets caught looking?

15:38.360 --> 15:39.260
- Uh...

15:40.100 --> 15:41.300
We didn't think of that.

15:44.838 --> 15:47.588
(doorbell rings)

15:53.658 --> 15:54.741
(Beth scoffs)

15:54.741 --> 15:55.991
- Unbelievable.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.980
Sorry for the mess,
we're still settling in.

16:04.980 --> 16:07.310
- Holy hottie!

16:07.310 --> 16:09.003
You're Xavier's girlfriend?

16:11.140 --> 16:14.138
You're way too pretty to
be Xavier's girlfriend.

16:14.138 --> 16:16.197
- Aww, how cute, he
still calls you Xavier.

16:16.197 --> 16:17.363
- Yeah-huh, so cute.

16:18.260 --> 16:20.850
- Kyle, they are just friends.

16:20.850 --> 16:22.993
- Well, she's too pretty to be his friend.

16:26.030 --> 16:26.980
- Got enough money?

16:28.160 --> 16:29.477
- Yeah, we better get outta here,

16:29.477 --> 16:30.980
you know, the movie's gonna start soon,

16:30.980 --> 16:33.103
so, uh, see ya later, bye.

16:36.831 --> 16:38.530
- Be careful, call us
if you need anything.

16:38.530 --> 16:39.625
- [Xavier] Of course, anything.

16:39.625 --> 16:40.792
- [Beth] Okay.

16:42.330 --> 16:44.730
- I think I'm gonna make the team.

16:44.730 --> 16:47.880
- Just give it your best
tomorrow, that's all you can do.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.200
- Did you ever wanna be a baseball player

16:49.200 --> 16:50.646
when you were a kid, Dad?

16:50.646 --> 16:51.479
- Yeah,

16:52.630 --> 16:53.623
of course I did.

16:54.750 --> 16:56.200
- [Kyle] Then why didn't you?

16:57.191 --> 16:58.870
- (chuckles) Well, it's not that easy.

16:58.870 --> 17:01.670
- But you said that if you try
your best and never give up,

17:01.670 --> 17:03.170
you can do anything.

17:03.170 --> 17:06.860
- You can, and that's true
for anything, not just sports.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.573
- Then what happened?

17:08.573 --> 17:09.423
Did you get hurt?

17:10.534 --> 17:11.870
(Ted chuckles)

17:11.870 --> 17:12.810
- No, I...

17:13.676 --> 17:15.060
(soft music)

17:15.060 --> 17:15.893
Well,

17:18.490 --> 17:22.620
as I got older, I just started
focusing on other things,

17:22.620 --> 17:24.770
and then baseball became
more just for fun.

17:26.070 --> 17:28.270
I guess I gave up without
really knowing it.

17:29.550 --> 17:33.053
- Dad, can you make sure I don't give up?

17:36.582 --> 17:38.324
(whistle blows)

17:38.324 --> 17:39.157
- Go!

17:40.172 --> 17:42.203
- Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.

17:42.203 --> 17:44.200
3.16.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.033
- Go!

17:47.130 --> 17:49.050
- Come on now.
(upbeat music)

17:49.050 --> 17:50.283
3.25.

17:51.630 --> 17:52.463
- Go!

17:56.666 --> 17:57.583
- Woo, 2.7!

17:59.437 --> 18:00.523
- 2.7.

18:00.523 --> 18:03.410
- I think he's got you, AJ.

18:03.410 --> 18:04.420
- Go!

18:04.420 --> 18:05.433
Come on, let's dig!

18:08.600 --> 18:09.970
- 2.6.

18:09.970 --> 18:11.143
- (chuckles) My man.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.273
Go!

18:14.250 --> 18:15.350
Hustle.

18:15.350 --> 18:16.650
Nice wheels.

18:16.650 --> 18:17.803
- 2.9!

18:18.820 --> 18:20.700
- Listen, you need to hustle, alright?

18:20.700 --> 18:21.746
Go!

18:21.746 --> 18:23.700
Hustle, hustle!

18:23.700 --> 18:25.310
Hustle!
- Dig, dig, dig, dig.

18:25.310 --> 18:26.690
3.4.

18:26.690 --> 18:27.890
Nice hustle.

18:27.890 --> 18:29.550
- That's not happening.

18:29.550 --> 18:30.403
Next.

18:38.340 --> 18:39.890
- Nice bat.

18:39.890 --> 18:41.990
Where'd you find that, somebody's garbage?

18:45.440 --> 18:46.923
- Hey, look alive, fellas.

18:57.550 --> 18:58.383
Rotate.

18:59.237 --> 19:01.820
(upbeat music)

19:06.048 --> 19:10.840
- [Rick] Great toss, look
alive, Mason, look alive.

19:10.840 --> 19:11.673
- [Chad] Get it!

19:13.950 --> 19:15.260
- How am I supposed to get to that?

19:15.260 --> 19:16.910
- Stop whining and make the play!

19:21.341 --> 19:22.508
Come on, Mase.

19:36.490 --> 19:39.240
That's it, that looks
good, fellas, more of that.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.093
Rotate.

19:57.599 --> 19:58.741
(ball whips into mitt)

19:58.741 --> 20:00.543
- Ow! (winces)

20:00.543 --> 20:03.724
(upbeat music)

20:03.724 --> 20:05.000
(winces)

20:05.000 --> 20:06.380
- [Chad] Let's go!

20:06.380 --> 20:07.213
Hustle!

20:11.960 --> 20:14.313
Make a play for home,
I wanna see those arms.

20:16.470 --> 20:17.930
- Nice job.

20:17.930 --> 20:18.763
- [Chad] Rotate.

20:26.514 --> 20:27.347
Come on.

20:27.347 --> 20:28.600
- That was a good jump he had.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.885
(ball whips into mitt)

20:33.885 --> 20:35.385
That was a bullet.

20:36.846 --> 20:37.740
(whistle blows)

20:37.740 --> 20:38.803
- Let's bring it in.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.730
- Okay, jog it in, fellas, hustle up.

20:43.390 --> 20:44.830
- Alright, listen up,

20:44.830 --> 20:47.260
anyone trying out for pitcher, stay here,

20:47.260 --> 20:49.550
everybody else, you can go.

20:49.550 --> 20:53.028
And check the website Wednesday
to see if you made the team.

20:53.028 --> 20:53.928
- Good work, guys.

20:56.700 --> 21:00.920
- We can bundle your
internet, all your wireless...

21:00.920 --> 21:03.549
(phone rings)
Hi, we can bundle all your...

21:03.549 --> 21:06.049
(phone rings)

21:08.750 --> 21:10.900
We can bundle all your wireless devices

21:10.900 --> 21:14.690
for 30% less...
(phone rings)

21:17.810 --> 21:18.730
Hey, is everything okay?

21:18.730 --> 21:20.950
I got a sales meeting in five minutes.

21:20.950 --> 21:23.320
- [Beth] Kyle didn't make the team.

21:23.320 --> 21:24.680
- What?

21:24.680 --> 21:28.340
But, I thought they weren't
gonna post it until tomorrow?

21:28.340 --> 21:30.730
- [Beth] He checked right after
school and they were there.

21:30.730 --> 21:32.130
He wants to talk to you.

21:32.130 --> 21:33.143
- Okay, put him on.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.280
- [Kyle] Dad?

21:35.280 --> 21:36.930
- Hey, honey.

21:36.930 --> 21:38.350
- [Kyle] I got cut.

21:38.350 --> 21:40.880
- Yeah, yeah, Mom just told me.

21:40.880 --> 21:44.120
Um, listen, I think
there might be a mistake.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.430
- [Kyle] Can you call Coach and find out?

21:46.430 --> 21:48.620
- Yeah, I will, and, um,

21:48.620 --> 21:51.520
let's not worry about it until
we find out for sure, okay?

21:52.490 --> 21:53.323
- [Kyle] Okay.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.303
I love you.

21:56.303 --> 21:57.503
- I love you too, buddy.

21:59.025 --> 21:59.975
I'll see you later.

22:07.834 --> 22:09.290
(tires squeal)

22:09.290 --> 22:11.180
Rick, I watched the entire tryouts,

22:11.180 --> 22:14.220
you can't tell me he wasn't
one of the best kids out there.

22:14.220 --> 22:16.450
- [Rick] The tryouts are
just one part of the process.

22:16.450 --> 22:18.540
- He's batting over .500,

22:18.540 --> 22:20.950
he plays any position you need him to.

22:20.950 --> 22:21.930
- [Rick] I pushed for Kyle,

22:21.930 --> 22:23.950
but Chad makes the final decisions,

22:23.950 --> 22:25.370
you need to talk to him.

22:25.370 --> 22:26.560
- I will talk to Chad,

22:26.560 --> 22:27.980
and you know what, Rick?

22:27.980 --> 22:29.130
You need to get some...

22:31.420 --> 22:32.919
Hey.

22:32.919 --> 22:35.943
- Hi, that list was right,
his friend texted him.

22:35.943 --> 22:37.683
- I know, I talked to Rick.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.253
- Well, he's downstairs.

22:41.820 --> 22:42.870
- Wait, what's wrong?

22:43.790 --> 22:46.260
- Kyle got cut from the all-star team.

22:46.260 --> 22:47.093
- What?

22:48.220 --> 22:50.150
That's bullsh...

22:50.150 --> 22:51.268
Shoot.

22:51.268 --> 22:52.101
Bullshoot.

22:52.101 --> 22:54.060
He's probably the best kid out there.

22:54.060 --> 22:55.660
Better than half of our JV team.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.007
- I'll go talk to him.

22:58.007 --> 22:58.840
- Yeah.

23:05.749 --> 23:08.340
(soft music)

23:08.340 --> 23:09.173
- Hey.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.193
Honey, it's okay to be sad,

23:21.800 --> 23:23.040
but you can't be upset with yourself,

23:23.040 --> 23:24.370
you didn't do anything wrong.

23:24.370 --> 23:25.870
The only reason you didn't make the team

23:25.870 --> 23:27.720
is because you were treated unfairly.

23:34.730 --> 23:36.943
I know it doesn't feel like it right now,

23:38.529 --> 23:41.423
but this is just a minor setback, alright?

23:43.150 --> 23:45.630
Never let something like
this knock you off course,

23:45.630 --> 23:47.253
use it to make you stronger.

24:03.089 --> 24:04.922
Hey, buddy, come here.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.781
This is gonna be okay.

24:13.188 --> 24:16.910
I'm gonna talk to Chad after
your game this weekend, okay?

24:18.930 --> 24:20.410
Besides, if that's what it's like here,

24:20.410 --> 24:21.270
what do you think about playing

24:21.270 --> 24:22.870
in a different league next year?

24:24.409 --> 24:29.409
- I don't know.

24:31.930 --> 24:33.560
- [Announcer] In the air
to right, pretty well hit,

24:33.560 --> 24:37.180
keep your eye on it, back
to the track, to the wall,

24:37.180 --> 24:38.013
and it's gone!

24:38.948 --> 24:42.643
Brock Holt with a solo homer
to lead off the eighth,

24:42.643 --> 24:44.493
and it's a one-run game.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.559
- I'm not gonna wear seven next year.

24:51.559 --> 24:52.820
- Hmm?

24:52.820 --> 24:56.523
- I'm gonna wear number
12, that's my year.

24:58.460 --> 25:01.370
I'm gonna be the best
player in this state.

25:01.370 --> 25:02.203
- Yeah?

25:04.940 --> 25:05.973
That's my man.

25:07.120 --> 25:07.953
But listen,

25:09.747 --> 25:10.748
(upbeat music)

25:10.748 --> 25:11.748
it starts right now.

25:14.780 --> 25:18.453
When you wake up tomorrow
morning, you are on a mission.

25:19.690 --> 25:22.580
You don't stop training,
you don't stop practicing,

25:22.580 --> 25:25.020
you don't stop fighting

25:25.020 --> 25:28.093
until you are the absolute
best ballplayer you can be.

25:29.847 --> 25:31.296
Got it?

25:31.296 --> 25:32.129
- Got it.

26:04.550 --> 26:07.190
- Oh, what are you doing up?

26:07.190 --> 26:09.560
- You said it started when
I woke up this morning.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.323
- Yeah, um, well,

26:12.300 --> 26:15.270
I kinda meant that,
you know, figuratively.

26:15.270 --> 26:17.210
- I don't know what that means.

26:17.210 --> 26:18.110
Here's your glove.

26:19.261 --> 26:20.094
Come on.

26:21.960 --> 26:24.543
(upbeat music)

26:30.170 --> 26:32.101
- Hey, good job, buddy.

26:32.101 --> 26:33.120
You know, I'm heading over.

26:33.120 --> 26:36.623
- Okay, but, uh, honey, be constructive.

26:37.829 --> 26:38.662
- What?

26:41.049 --> 26:41.960
- Hey.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.270
Good job.
- Chad,

26:43.270 --> 26:44.230
you got a minute?

26:44.230 --> 26:46.840
- Yeah, what's up?

26:46.840 --> 26:49.189
- Hey, I'm Ted, I'm Kyle Cooke's father.

26:49.189 --> 26:50.230
- Hey, man.

26:50.230 --> 26:51.063
- Yeah, listen,

26:51.993 --> 26:54.370
he's pretty crushed about
not making the travel team.

26:54.370 --> 26:56.010
- Yeah, he's pretty good,

26:56.010 --> 26:56.990
but we got a core group

26:56.990 --> 26:58.490
that's done really well
the last few years.

26:58.490 --> 26:59.430
- Yeah, no, I get that,

26:59.430 --> 27:02.480
but, you know, he's having
a great season this year,

27:02.480 --> 27:04.610
and, frankly, I watched the entire tryouts

27:04.610 --> 27:07.170
and there weren't many
kids better than him.

27:07.170 --> 27:10.528
- Well, (sighs) you know,
he missed that fly ball.

27:10.528 --> 27:11.670
(Ted chuckles)

27:11.670 --> 27:13.790
- Missed it? He was the
only one close to it.

27:13.790 --> 27:16.523
- Yeah, but that's the kinda
thing that costs you the game.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.823
Listen, he's just not ready
for the all-star team.

27:21.930 --> 27:24.380
You should think about
having him pitch though,

27:24.380 --> 27:26.450
we always need pitchers.

27:26.450 --> 27:27.283
- Chad,

27:28.740 --> 27:29.810
let's quit dancing around this,

27:29.810 --> 27:32.023
he shoulda made the team, and you know it.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.680
Alright, don't give me this
load of garbage about pitching.

27:35.680 --> 27:37.250
- I'll tell you what,

27:37.250 --> 27:38.730
there are a lotta good kids
that didn't make the team,

27:38.730 --> 27:40.840
maybe next year, we can have a B team,

27:40.840 --> 27:43.550
and he gets some travel games in there,

27:43.550 --> 27:44.383
how about that?

27:47.330 --> 27:48.223
- You're a punk.

27:51.920 --> 27:56.410
Oh yeah, have you ever swung a bat before?

27:56.410 --> 27:58.313
Your swing is terrible.

28:04.185 --> 28:05.018
- Okay.

28:05.018 --> 28:05.851
How'd it go?

28:05.851 --> 28:06.684
- Oh, it went great.

28:07.580 --> 28:09.880
I think we'll be joining
a new league next year.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.100
You ready to practice?

28:11.100 --> 28:12.040
- Born ready.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.510
(upbeat music)

28:14.510 --> 28:15.343
(ball hits fence)

28:15.343 --> 28:16.630
- Keep your head in there.

28:18.702 --> 28:19.535
(ball hits fence)

28:19.535 --> 28:21.910
Don't pull your head
away, even after contact,

28:21.910 --> 28:23.480
your eyes never leave the tee.

28:23.480 --> 28:24.523
Okay? Focus.

28:27.890 --> 28:29.520
- Can you pitch some to me now?

28:29.520 --> 28:31.053
- Nope, fundamentals, Kyle.

28:33.023 --> 28:35.856
(ball hits fence)

28:43.303 --> 28:46.190
Get your glove down earlier,
Kyle, ready position.

28:46.190 --> 28:47.023
Here we go.

28:50.980 --> 28:52.253
Nice, that's better.

28:54.050 --> 28:55.330
- Can we do some backhands?

28:55.330 --> 28:57.253
- Nope, fundamentals, buddy.

28:59.860 --> 29:01.363
Nice stop.

29:06.650 --> 29:10.800
Take a couple steps back,
then come in for the catch.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.113
Forward motion.

29:18.770 --> 29:20.370
- Can we do some diving catches?

29:22.330 --> 29:23.280
Okay, fundamentals.

29:31.510 --> 29:32.443
Hi, Brooke.

29:33.560 --> 29:35.390
- Hey, Kyle.

29:35.390 --> 29:36.880
Sorry you didn't make the team.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.070
- It's fine, I'll make it next year,

29:39.070 --> 29:41.705
win states, probably make
it to the World Series.

29:41.705 --> 29:42.560
- (chuckles) Oh yeah?

29:42.560 --> 29:43.393
- Yeah.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.670
Did you know that if you two married,

29:45.670 --> 29:47.644
your name would be Brooke Cooke?

29:47.644 --> 29:50.720
(Brooke chuckles)

29:50.720 --> 29:51.623
Hey, Xavier?

29:52.670 --> 29:53.653
Hey, Xavier?

29:55.780 --> 29:56.763
X?

29:58.320 --> 30:00.180
Can you practice with me after school?

30:00.180 --> 30:01.313
- I don't know.

30:01.313 --> 30:02.810
- What do you mean? Help your brother.

30:02.810 --> 30:04.233
- Yeah, help your brother.

30:07.850 --> 30:09.270
What do you wanna be?

30:09.270 --> 30:10.850
- I wanna be a scientist.

30:10.850 --> 30:13.400
- She's gonna work on
artificial intelligence,

30:13.400 --> 30:14.300
create the future.

30:17.210 --> 30:20.540
- Dad, tell Xavier to practice
with me during fall ball.

30:20.540 --> 30:22.580
- Practice with your brother.

30:22.580 --> 30:26.840
Kyle, you can train on
your own too, you know?

30:26.840 --> 30:31.080
Remember, whenever you're not practicing,

30:31.080 --> 30:33.080
somewhere, someone else is,

30:33.080 --> 30:35.243
and when you meet him, he will win.

30:38.050 --> 30:39.950
So be the one who's always practicing.

30:53.724 --> 30:56.391
(blows on hand)

31:01.820 --> 31:05.010
Swing looks great, you're
just a little ahead of it.

31:05.010 --> 31:05.950
Timing, remember,

31:05.950 --> 31:08.000
timing's the most
important part of hitting.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.500
Sit back and wait on this one.

31:16.663 --> 31:18.970
- Dad, that's my first homer.

31:18.970 --> 31:20.120
- First of many, buddy.

31:21.484 --> 31:23.440
Alright, I'm gonna throw a little faster.

31:23.440 --> 31:26.903
Just lay off, watch a few
go by, get your timing.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.044
Alright, swing away.

31:40.044 --> 31:42.627
(upbeat music)

31:49.640 --> 31:50.473
Perfect.

32:02.770 --> 32:04.730
Alright, I'm gonna throw even faster.

32:04.730 --> 32:06.180
Time it coming outta my hand.

32:15.113 --> 32:17.110
- Throw it even harder.

32:17.110 --> 32:17.943
- Faster?

32:19.630 --> 32:22.210
You think you can handle the cheese?

32:22.210 --> 32:24.160
I pitched in college, remember?

32:24.160 --> 32:24.993
- Come on, Dad.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.120
- Alright, don't get too excited,

32:29.120 --> 32:31.220
'cause I'm gonna blow this right past you.

32:32.590 --> 32:33.690
Here comes the heater.

32:47.443 --> 32:49.860
(Ted laughs)

32:53.980 --> 32:56.230
Now you know what the
pros have to deal with.

32:57.300 --> 32:58.641
- One more.

32:58.641 --> 33:01.058
(wind howls)

33:03.132 --> 33:06.049
("Deck the Halls")

33:09.204 --> 33:13.212
(Ted whistles "Deck the Halls")

33:13.212 --> 33:14.045
- [Beth] Kyle!

33:14.045 --> 33:14.878
- [Kyle] What?

33:14.878 --> 33:16.170
- It's brand new,

33:16.170 --> 33:18.480
your grandparents just got
you that for Christmas.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.420
- I really like it, but
I can't throw in it.

33:20.420 --> 33:21.870
- Then don't practice in it.

33:21.870 --> 33:23.693
- But then the rest of me gets cold.

33:34.870 --> 33:39.440
- Okay, uh, no more
outdoor winter practice.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.380
- You know, why don't
you two give it a break?

33:41.380 --> 33:42.933
- Mom, I'm not stopping.

33:51.470 --> 33:53.420
Can't you make Xavier practice with me?

33:54.570 --> 33:55.990
- What's wrong with me?

33:55.990 --> 33:59.550
- Nothing, but he never
plays with me anymore.

33:59.550 --> 34:02.280
- Ah, he still loves you, buddy,

34:02.280 --> 34:06.040
he's just, well, you know,
he's a young man now,

34:06.040 --> 34:08.593
and his interests change a little bit.

34:09.700 --> 34:11.610
- So you can't make him do it?

34:11.610 --> 34:15.993
- Honey, honestly, I don't
think it's gonna happen.

34:23.250 --> 34:25.223
Alright, get your hips around.

34:30.030 --> 34:33.143
- Dad, aren't you supposed
to be at work now?

34:34.076 --> 34:38.647
- Ah, I'm in sales, so, I
can shuffle things around.

34:40.760 --> 34:42.760
- I don't wanna have to move again, Dad.

34:43.970 --> 34:46.230
So if Xavier practiced with me,

34:46.230 --> 34:47.507
then you could do more work,

34:47.507 --> 34:49.740
and then everything would be fine.

34:49.740 --> 34:51.133
- Kyle, I can't force him.

34:52.200 --> 34:53.033
No one can.

34:57.505 --> 34:59.922
(soft music)

35:23.920 --> 35:25.533
- Hey, you coming up?

35:26.493 --> 35:27.326
- Yeah.

35:31.937 --> 35:33.590
- You wanna talk?

35:33.590 --> 35:35.980
- I don't know if I can make this work.

35:35.980 --> 35:38.013
I feel like I've ruined everything for us.

35:39.193 --> 35:41.560
I mean, look at me, I'm a
loser for crying out loud,

35:41.560 --> 35:44.093
my boss is 27 years old.

35:45.185 --> 35:47.390
I know 10 times as much
as anyone in the region

35:47.390 --> 35:49.950
and I can't make a sale to save my life.

35:49.950 --> 35:52.373
- Just give it time, you'll figure it out.

35:55.500 --> 35:58.684
- I don't want the boys to
have a failure for a father.

35:58.684 --> 36:01.593
- (scoffs) Ted, would you just stop it?

36:02.607 --> 36:05.700
You know, you should listen
to what you say to the kids.

36:05.700 --> 36:07.773
Take your own advice, it works.

36:09.170 --> 36:13.203
And if it doesn't, we can
always move in with my parents.

36:16.540 --> 36:18.540
That was just a little extra motivation.

36:27.785 --> 36:30.118
(Ted sighs)

36:37.820 --> 36:40.033
- Buddy, good news,

36:41.030 --> 36:43.960
I got you signed up
for a team in Brighton.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.730
They're not even in our district.

36:45.730 --> 36:46.790
- Alright.

36:46.790 --> 36:48.040
- Isn't that far away?

36:48.040 --> 36:49.610
- It's, like, 40 minutes away,

36:49.610 --> 36:51.465
they do it differently there.

36:51.465 --> 36:52.298
Alright,

36:52.298 --> 36:53.980
so all the new kids go for
an evaluation in two weeks,

36:53.980 --> 36:56.350
and then they divide the kids
into an A, B, and C team.

36:56.350 --> 36:58.100
At the end of the season,

36:58.100 --> 37:00.520
the best 12 kids on the A team

37:00.520 --> 37:02.110
get selected for the all-star team,

37:02.110 --> 37:03.160
but here's the thing,

37:04.140 --> 37:05.970
they use a selection committee.

37:05.970 --> 37:07.210
Two of the coaches' kids

37:07.210 --> 37:09.460
didn't even make the
all-star team last year.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.290
Where are you going?

37:12.290 --> 37:13.403
- [Kyle] Practice.

37:15.870 --> 37:19.490
- Uh, don't you have to live
in a city to play on its team?

37:19.490 --> 37:20.323
- You do.

37:20.323 --> 37:22.213
I, uh, I rented an apartment.

37:23.740 --> 37:25.580
- Ted, have you lost your mind?

37:25.580 --> 37:26.860
- It's a really cheap apartment,

37:26.860 --> 37:28.700
and, uh, we might be living there anyway

37:28.700 --> 37:30.543
if things don't turn around here soon.

37:33.140 --> 37:35.650
Honey,
(upbeat music)

37:35.650 --> 37:36.803
this is his one shot.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.693
He doesn't get to be 12 again.

37:47.290 --> 37:49.280
Right, and they'll never
let him on the team here,

37:49.280 --> 37:52.033
they wouldn't let Hank
Aaron on the team here.

37:53.200 --> 37:56.103
And I know it's crazy, but I gotta do it.

37:57.000 --> 37:57.833
Okay?

37:59.700 --> 38:02.050
We have to give him a
chance to live his dream.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.823
- Then make him a champion.

38:05.823 --> 38:08.490
(intense music)

38:14.740 --> 38:15.573
- Go!

38:15.573 --> 38:16.743
Dig, dig, dig.

38:17.800 --> 38:18.953
Nice.

38:44.020 --> 38:45.070
- 47,

38:45.070 --> 38:45.903
48,

38:45.903 --> 38:46.736
49,

38:46.736 --> 38:47.569
50.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.763
- Awesome, man, awesome!

38:51.650 --> 38:53.060
Now we gotta get some protein in you,

38:53.060 --> 38:55.160
replenish those muscles.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.130
- What should I eat?

38:56.130 --> 38:58.849
- Meat, chicken, maybe make you some tuna.

38:58.849 --> 39:00.190
- Ugh, I hate tuna.

39:00.190 --> 39:02.520
- Hey, it doesn't matter
what it tastes like,

39:02.520 --> 39:04.690
we just gotta get it in your system.

39:04.690 --> 39:06.440
Rocky drank raw eggs.

39:13.342 --> 39:15.225
- [Announcer] Number 17,
and he hits one to left.

39:15.225 --> 39:18.892
(crowd cheers and applauds)

39:20.772 --> 39:21.922
- I shoulda tried that.

39:24.514 --> 39:26.847
(footsteps)

39:28.450 --> 39:30.722
- Hey, Kyle, how's it going?

39:30.722 --> 39:32.180
- Hi.

39:32.180 --> 39:33.880
X, can you practice with me?

39:33.880 --> 39:35.920
I only have two weeks
before my evaluation.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.640
- I can't, I won't have time with school,

39:37.640 --> 39:39.200
and practice, and everything.

39:39.200 --> 39:41.000
- Please, it only has to be a half-hour,

39:41.000 --> 39:43.090
doesn't even have to be every day.

39:43.090 --> 39:43.923
- Sorry, bud.

39:45.880 --> 39:48.613
- So, if you had more
time, you'd help Kyle?

39:49.780 --> 39:51.409
- Yeah, I mean, I'd
love to help him, but--

39:51.409 --> 39:53.883
- Well, well, let's break up then.

39:54.817 --> 39:55.650
- What?

39:55.650 --> 39:57.450
- That'll give you a lotta time back.

39:57.450 --> 39:58.820
- Um...

39:58.820 --> 39:59.969
- And then I'm gone for good.

39:59.969 --> 40:01.630
(upbeat music)

40:01.630 --> 40:02.463
- Hold on.

40:08.630 --> 40:10.500
Weight on your toes.

40:10.500 --> 40:14.150
Using distribution, and
watch the pitcher's knee.

40:15.790 --> 40:18.383
Throw with your hips
just as much as your arm.

40:24.219 --> 40:27.953
Ready?

40:30.921 --> 40:32.023
- Ah, one more lap.

40:37.874 --> 40:40.291
- [Xavier] Through the chest.

40:53.140 --> 40:55.263
- There's no way I'm doing those.

40:56.680 --> 40:57.763
- Alright, watch this.

41:16.751 --> 41:18.043
Alright, you ready? Here you go.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.967
- [Kyle] Come on, hit 'em harder.

41:24.751 --> 41:25.940
Harder.

41:25.940 --> 41:27.800
- They don't need to
be fast for this drill.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.290
- These are too easy.

41:29.290 --> 41:30.123
- Okay, fine.

41:34.903 --> 41:35.736
(Xavier chuckles)

41:35.736 --> 41:37.253
- You can slow 'em down now.

41:37.253 --> 41:39.253
- That's what I thought.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.033
- Go.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.983
Come on, Kyle, whoop that hot-shot!

41:58.000 --> 41:58.833
Good job.

41:58.833 --> 41:59.833
- Thank you.

42:04.568 --> 42:08.235
(Xavier and Brooke chuckle)

42:09.196 --> 42:11.029
- I don't wanna pitch.

42:12.440 --> 42:15.600
- You don't have to, but
you gotta get over it.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.700
Mental strength in baseball

42:16.700 --> 42:18.350
is just as important as physical.

42:20.125 --> 42:21.725
You need to tune everything out.

42:23.830 --> 42:24.683
Focus.

42:26.310 --> 42:28.503
Laser focus.

42:38.120 --> 42:39.380
Alright?

42:39.380 --> 42:41.993
Now, give it a shot, okay?

42:49.190 --> 42:52.880
Try and, uh, try and get close, okay?

42:52.880 --> 42:53.713
You got this.

43:04.090 --> 43:05.340
Alright, close your eyes.

43:07.830 --> 43:08.663
Close 'em.

43:10.453 --> 43:11.603
Let your mind go blank,

43:12.670 --> 43:15.660
picture a black sky with only one star

43:15.660 --> 43:17.750
right in the middle of it.

43:17.750 --> 43:18.623
Focus on it.

43:21.560 --> 43:22.563
Open your eyes,

43:24.140 --> 43:25.093
but not your mind.

43:26.693 --> 43:27.526
See that ball?

43:29.352 --> 43:30.502
That ball is your star.

43:31.590 --> 43:33.793
Focus and hit it.

43:44.730 --> 43:48.170
You are now the dragon warrior.

43:48.170 --> 43:50.020
Go.
(Oriental music)

43:50.020 --> 43:51.120
Nice job today, buddy.

43:52.010 --> 43:53.413
You're gonna kill it tomorrow.

43:59.971 --> 44:02.638
(intense music)

44:18.563 --> 44:20.210
- I can do this.

44:20.210 --> 44:21.190
I can do this.

44:39.291 --> 44:42.541
(Kyle gags and coughs)

44:45.502 --> 44:47.249
- [Ted] You sure you got everything?

44:47.249 --> 44:48.710
- Yeah, I checked last night.

44:48.710 --> 44:52.870
- Uh, looks a little
different for some reason.

44:52.870 --> 44:54.067
Check if your bat's in there.

44:54.067 --> 44:55.153
- I know it is.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.703
- Just check before I leave.

45:01.643 --> 45:04.060
(soft music)

45:06.230 --> 45:08.330
That's the last piece of the puzzle, Kyle,

45:09.296 --> 45:10.596
now show 'em what you got.

45:11.750 --> 45:13.461
And, uh, don't tell your mother, huh?

45:13.461 --> 45:16.128
(Kyle chuckles)

45:21.640 --> 45:22.950
Hey,

45:22.950 --> 45:23.783
Ted Cooke.

45:23.783 --> 45:24.616
- Hey.

45:24.616 --> 45:25.449
- Uh, this is Kyle.

45:25.449 --> 45:27.140
- Hey, Kyle, Coach John.

45:27.140 --> 45:27.973
- Hi, Coach.

45:27.973 --> 45:32.440
- Oh, that's quite a few
new players out there.

45:32.440 --> 45:35.050
- Oh, a lot of them are
from last year's A team,

45:35.050 --> 45:37.650
they, uh, tell me that
they're here for the workout,

45:37.650 --> 45:41.110
but they're really here to
just check out the competition.

45:41.110 --> 45:42.560
Why don't you go out and warm up

45:42.560 --> 45:44.950
and introduce yourself
to the rest of the guys?

45:44.950 --> 45:45.783
- Okay.

45:48.830 --> 45:50.983
- You're, uh, Xavier's dad too, right?

45:51.860 --> 45:53.034
- Yeah.

45:53.034 --> 45:54.790
- (chuckles) That boy is building himself

45:54.790 --> 45:56.110
quite a reputation.

45:56.110 --> 45:58.900
He struck out 11 in a row
against our high school squad.

45:58.900 --> 46:01.310
- Yeah, he was dialed in.

46:01.310 --> 46:03.670
- Please tell me Kyle can pitch like that.

46:03.670 --> 46:04.503
- He can,

46:05.530 --> 46:09.293
probably better, but, uh, but he doesn't.

46:10.440 --> 46:11.273
Um,

46:12.780 --> 46:13.963
he used to pitch, but,

46:16.080 --> 46:18.610
when he was nine, he
hit a kid in the ribs,

46:18.610 --> 46:20.103
and the kid's heart stopped.

46:20.960 --> 46:24.168
Kid collapsed, didn't look
like he was gonna make it.

46:24.168 --> 46:26.050
An EMT that was sitting in the stands

46:26.050 --> 46:27.590
came rushing out and revived the kid

46:27.590 --> 46:28.620
right there on the field,

46:28.620 --> 46:29.453
thank God.

46:31.160 --> 46:34.400
Kyle was distraught, said
he'd never pitch again,

46:34.400 --> 46:35.233
and he hasn't.

46:37.670 --> 46:39.620
Yeah, he doesn't like to talk about it.

46:41.850 --> 46:43.510
- Understood.

46:43.510 --> 46:44.343
Take care.

46:44.343 --> 46:45.176
- Thanks.

46:46.170 --> 46:47.170
- Alright, let's go.

46:48.850 --> 46:49.683
Come on.

46:50.930 --> 46:52.359
- You guys loose?

46:52.359 --> 46:53.310
- [Players] Yeah.

46:53.310 --> 46:54.143
- Good.

46:54.143 --> 46:58.010
Okay, guys from last year,
find a place in the field,

46:58.010 --> 47:00.773
new guys, head on in for BP.

47:07.990 --> 47:09.840
- Anything you're looking to see, Coach?

47:09.840 --> 47:12.380
- Nope, just make solid contact.

47:12.380 --> 47:14.210
Try to hit to all fields if you can.

47:14.210 --> 47:15.043
- Got it.

47:31.831 --> 47:35.180
- Does this kid even know how to hit?

47:35.180 --> 47:36.630
- Something wrong with those?

47:39.210 --> 47:40.670
Alright, swing away then.

47:42.391 --> 47:44.891
(tense music)

47:56.170 --> 47:57.003
Nice hit.

48:17.821 --> 48:18.654
- Holy...

48:41.760 --> 48:44.303
- Well, that's certainly
hitting to all fields.

48:45.541 --> 48:49.240
- Kyle, put one in the woods!

48:49.240 --> 48:50.073
- Go for it.

49:02.159 --> 49:02.992
What are you doing?

49:02.992 --> 49:04.513
- Just pitch it the same speed.

49:23.260 --> 49:24.093
- Listen up,

49:24.093 --> 49:26.730
if your parents have any
vacation plans this summer,

49:26.730 --> 49:29.080
you better tell them to cancel them.

49:30.277 --> 49:32.944
(John chuckles)

49:38.600 --> 49:40.060
- Jimmy,

49:40.060 --> 49:41.230
hey, call your AD

49:41.230 --> 49:43.870
and tell him to send a scout down here.

49:43.870 --> 49:45.460
No, he's 12.

49:45.460 --> 49:48.533
No, trust me, you wanna
start watching this kid now.

49:59.380 --> 50:01.763
- Hey, Kyle, guess what?

50:03.180 --> 50:04.800
You made the A team.

50:04.800 --> 50:07.080
- Congratulations, sweetheart.

50:07.080 --> 50:08.210
- Cool.

50:08.210 --> 50:09.560
- Cool?

50:09.560 --> 50:11.640
That's it, just cool, huh?

50:11.640 --> 50:13.480
- Yeah, cool.

50:13.480 --> 50:16.760
We're gonna win districts,
then states, then regionals,

50:16.760 --> 50:19.290
and then we're gonna win the World Series.

50:19.290 --> 50:20.350
- Okay.

50:20.350 --> 50:24.320
Um, well, Brighton got swept
in the districts last year,

50:24.320 --> 50:25.573
so let's just take it one game at a--

50:25.573 --> 50:27.530
- Dad, we're winning districts,

50:27.530 --> 50:29.760
we're not losing a game this year.

50:29.760 --> 50:30.593
- Really?

50:31.650 --> 50:33.600
- Not if I have anything to do with it.

50:37.430 --> 50:38.263
- [Beth] Whoa.

50:38.263 --> 50:39.200
- [Ted] Kyle...

50:39.200 --> 50:40.863
- What is that bat?

50:43.360 --> 50:46.093
- Yeah, yeah, what's that bat?

50:47.240 --> 50:48.193
- Okay, boys,

50:49.640 --> 50:51.260
this is our team.

50:51.260 --> 50:53.740
We're gonna be spending a
lotta time together this year,

50:53.740 --> 50:56.860
and our number one goal is
to improve on last year.

50:56.860 --> 50:57.693
Right?

50:57.693 --> 50:58.610
- [Players] Yes, Coach.

50:58.610 --> 51:01.680
- I wanna see all you guys working hard,

51:01.680 --> 51:04.030
alright, support your teammates.

51:04.030 --> 51:07.630
Okay, I need you guys
focused on every single play,

51:07.630 --> 51:10.349
every single pitch.

51:10.349 --> 51:12.290
Alright, we had a few
mental errors last year,

51:12.290 --> 51:14.460
and it cost us some games.

51:14.460 --> 51:15.900
That will not fly this year,

51:15.900 --> 51:18.423
every team is better
than they were last year.

51:19.420 --> 51:22.260
And I guarantee you that every 12-year-old

51:22.260 --> 51:24.463
has the same dream that you guys have,

51:25.330 --> 51:27.143
making it to the World Series.

51:30.020 --> 51:33.040
We have one new player
on our team this year,

51:33.040 --> 51:36.133
Kyle Cooke, you might
remember him from tryouts.

51:36.133 --> 51:37.013
(Troy chuckles)

51:37.013 --> 51:37.846
- Yeah.

51:37.846 --> 51:40.190
- Kyle, how come you're able to make

51:40.190 --> 51:42.003
that kinda contact on every swing?

51:42.931 --> 51:45.290
- Um, I practice a lot.

51:45.290 --> 51:46.450
- And how do you always know

51:46.450 --> 51:48.360
how to get your body positioned properly

51:48.360 --> 51:50.160
when you're making a play?

51:50.160 --> 51:52.240
- I practice that a lot too.

51:52.240 --> 51:53.730
- What about throwing?

51:53.730 --> 51:56.020
How do you keep up that accuracy?

51:56.020 --> 51:57.320
- Practice.

51:57.320 --> 52:01.159
- And how do you do that
crazy body-swingy thing?

52:01.159 --> 52:01.992
(John chuckles)

52:01.992 --> 52:04.454
- Oh, I just kinda made
that one up on my own.

52:04.454 --> 52:05.287
(Troy chuckles)

52:05.287 --> 52:06.780
- Alright, listen up, boys,

52:06.780 --> 52:08.270
you wanna have fun this year, right?

52:08.270 --> 52:09.103
- [Players] Yes, Coach.

52:09.103 --> 52:12.090
- Why play the game if
we're not gonna have fun?

52:12.090 --> 52:13.790
I'll tell you right now,

52:13.790 --> 52:15.920
the better you are at baseball,

52:15.920 --> 52:19.120
the more fun you're gonna
have playing baseball.

52:19.120 --> 52:21.700
And the only way you're gonna
get better is by practicing.

52:21.700 --> 52:25.520
Every day, whenever you
have free time, practice.

52:25.520 --> 52:27.730
And if you have a question, ask somebody.

52:27.730 --> 52:28.563
You with me?

52:28.563 --> 52:29.400
- [Players] Yes, coach.

52:29.400 --> 52:31.190
- Alright, let's go practice.

52:31.190 --> 52:32.023
Come on.

52:33.229 --> 52:35.137
- Let's go, guys.

52:35.137 --> 52:38.491
(car door closes)

52:38.491 --> 52:41.120
- Hey, what's going on?

52:41.120 --> 52:41.953
- Nothing.

52:42.950 --> 52:44.539
Practicing the knuckle curve.

52:44.539 --> 52:45.567
- Oh yeah?

52:45.567 --> 52:46.400
- Yeah.

52:47.473 --> 52:48.920
- Good pitch.

52:48.920 --> 52:50.608
- Looking good.

52:50.608 --> 52:51.441
How you doin', champ?

52:51.441 --> 52:52.274
- [Kyle] Good.

52:59.736 --> 53:00.569
- Ta-da!

53:01.416 --> 53:03.750
- (chuckles) Hey, what are those for?

53:03.750 --> 53:05.395
- For your enjoyment.

53:05.395 --> 53:06.720
- Mm.

53:06.720 --> 53:09.050
- And I closed that bundle deal.

53:09.050 --> 53:12.720
- Honey, congratulations.

53:12.720 --> 53:15.380
- Yeah, well, let's not get too excited,

53:15.380 --> 53:18.470
it's a small thing, but
hopefully the first of many.

53:18.470 --> 53:19.720
- Well, we just got the schedule,

53:19.720 --> 53:23.060
and their tournaments
start on the same day.

53:23.060 --> 53:24.100
So I'm gonna call their coaches,

53:24.100 --> 53:25.580
see if maybe they can
bring 'em to some games.

53:25.580 --> 53:26.660
- No, let me know the days,

53:26.660 --> 53:28.463
maybe I can take off a little early.

53:29.450 --> 53:30.720
- Are you sure?

53:30.720 --> 53:32.750
- Yeah, I can manage it.

53:32.750 --> 53:33.593
- Are you sure?

53:34.850 --> 53:36.800
- Didn't you just ask me if I was sure?

53:37.820 --> 53:39.130
- But are you sure you're sure?

53:39.130 --> 53:42.503
- I'm sure I'm sure. (Beth chuckles)

53:47.617 --> 53:49.238
- What's wrong?

53:49.238 --> 53:50.820
- I'm pitching against Brighton today.

53:50.820 --> 53:53.940
- They have a kid who's seven
for seven with five homers.

53:53.940 --> 53:56.590
He's, like, six-feet tall
and has a beard already.

53:56.590 --> 53:57.790
- I think I'll walk him.

54:15.540 --> 54:17.520
- You know that guy's a scout, right?

54:17.520 --> 54:18.648
I gotta go warm up.

54:18.648 --> 54:23.540
- Me too.
(upbeat music)

54:23.540 --> 54:24.373
- Come on now.

54:27.078 --> 54:30.411
(cheering and applause)

54:33.712 --> 54:34.795
Yeah, we win!

54:35.657 --> 54:36.937
Nice.

Yeah!

55:21.037 --> 55:21.870
Woo!

55:21.870 --> 55:24.208
(Chad laughs)

55:24.208 --> 55:27.785
That was a little high, but
I'll forgive ya this time.

55:27.785 --> 55:30.785
(players celebrate)

55:34.287 --> 55:37.370
(indistinct chatter)

55:42.080 --> 55:44.040
- [Player] Let's go, Alex,
this kid can't hit you,

55:44.040 --> 55:45.193
blow it past him now.

55:49.546 --> 55:50.390
- Strike.

55:50.390 --> 55:52.200
- He's a looker, he's not gonna swing.

55:52.200 --> 55:53.717
Two more, sit him down now.

56:14.844 --> 56:18.177
(cheering and applause)

56:24.414 --> 56:28.013
(players celebrate)

56:28.013 --> 56:31.346
(cheering and applause)

56:37.098 --> 56:40.431
(cheering and applause)

56:42.261 --> 56:43.570
- Alright, listen up.

56:43.570 --> 56:46.950
Hey, pipe down, come on
now, this is important.

56:46.950 --> 56:48.160
We're up 13 now,

56:48.160 --> 56:49.930
so we get the next three outs

56:49.930 --> 56:51.720
and we end this game early, alright?

56:51.720 --> 56:53.510
Max, you take third base,

56:53.510 --> 56:55.602
Mason, you're pitching, alright?

56:55.602 --> 56:57.730
You close this one out
for us, alright, buddy.

56:57.730 --> 56:59.820
Bring it in, Oakwood on three, alright?

56:59.820 --> 57:01.579
One, two, three,

57:01.579 --> 57:02.421

57:02.421 --> 57:03.338
- Let's go.

57:04.308 --> 57:05.577
Come on, Mase.

57:05.577 --> 57:08.910
(cheering and applause)

57:17.026 --> 57:18.292
Get under it, Aiden.

57:18.292 --> 57:19.125
Two hands.

57:20.622 --> 57:23.100
(cheering and applause)

57:23.100 --> 57:24.350
- Yeah!

57:24.350 --> 57:27.620
Good catch, Aiden, good catch!

57:27.620 --> 57:29.320
Alright, boys, line 'er up.

57:29.320 --> 57:31.860
Great job out there today, boys.

57:31.860 --> 57:33.580
Great hitting all the
way through the lineup.

57:33.580 --> 57:35.212
Jimmy, way to make the double play.

57:35.212 --> 57:36.045
- Thank you.

57:36.045 --> 57:38.490
- Let's just keep it together
these last two games.

57:38.490 --> 57:41.800
We win this district, we
roll through states, right?

57:41.800 --> 57:42.700
Let's bring it in.

57:43.850 --> 57:45.220
Oakwood, one, two, three,

57:45.220 --> 57:46.553
- [All] Oakwood!

57:47.446 --> 57:48.996
- Nice game, fellas, nice game.

57:50.320 --> 57:54.980
- Hey, guys, I told you
once we got to districts,

57:54.980 --> 57:56.640
we play to win.

57:56.640 --> 57:59.490
I let your parents know
you wouldn't play much.

57:59.490 --> 58:00.730
You're here in case somebody gets hurt

58:00.730 --> 58:02.430
or if there's an emergency, right?

58:04.810 --> 58:05.963
That's all I can tell ya.

58:08.727 --> 58:13.727
- Let's go.

58:14.170 --> 58:18.961
- Let's go, Evans, we need
some runs or this game's over.

58:18.961 --> 58:22.294
(cheering and applause)

58:23.141 --> 58:24.527
- I got it, I got it, I got it!

58:24.527 --> 58:26.374

58:26.374 --> 58:28.874

58:31.893 --> 58:32.726

58:32.726 --> 58:35.764
(cheering and applause)

58:35.764 --> 58:36.597
- Yeah!

58:38.031 --> 58:39.122
(players celebrate)

58:39.122 --> 58:41.216
- [Players] Danny! Danny! Danny!

58:41.216 --> 58:43.535
Danny! Danny! Danny!

58:43.535 --> 58:45.202
Danny! Danny! Danny!

58:46.195 --> 58:49.086
- Yes, keep going, go, go, go, go!

58:49.086 --> 58:51.640
Dig it out, dig it out, yeah, you got it!

58:51.640 --> 58:54.057
Cruise it in, yeah!

58:54.057 --> 58:55.674
Alright!

58:55.674 --> 58:58.091
Let's line it up, boys, nice!

58:59.377 --> 59:00.210
Good job.
- Nice hustle,

59:00.210 --> 59:01.710
good game, Sandbridge.

59:01.710 --> 59:03.610
Nice job, guys.
- Good game.

59:03.610 --> 59:04.650
- Good game.

59:04.650 --> 59:05.483
- Hey, Rick,

59:08.550 --> 59:11.030
let's book those hotel rooms
now for the World Series.

59:11.030 --> 59:13.030
- The World Series?

59:13.030 --> 59:15.890
We need to figure out
how to get to regionals.

59:15.890 --> 59:16.870
Brighton's undefeated,

59:16.870 --> 59:20.340
they've outscored the other
teams 75 to nine so far.

59:20.340 --> 59:22.110
- Brighton sucked last year.

59:22.110 --> 59:24.290
- Well, they don't suck now.

59:24.290 --> 59:26.853
At least the Sox got a
hundred grand for Ruth.

59:27.740 --> 59:29.190
They oughta send you flowers.

59:37.450 --> 59:39.670
- So you guys ready for states?

59:39.670 --> 59:41.853
- Yeah, they've never been there before.

59:42.940 --> 59:43.930
- You'll be fine,

59:43.930 --> 59:45.570
just play your hardest
and keep everyone focused.

59:45.570 --> 59:49.500
- You sound like Dad. (Xavier chuckles)

59:49.500 --> 59:51.840
Do you think he'll be okay?

59:51.840 --> 59:54.240
- I think as long as
we're okay, he'll be okay,

59:54.240 --> 59:55.290
you know what I mean?

59:57.960 --> 1:00:01.030
Dad's always trying to act
like he wants us to act,

1:00:01.030 --> 1:00:01.990
even when he was faking it.

1:00:01.990 --> 1:00:04.690
I think he just needs to
feed off us for a little bit.

1:00:06.130 --> 1:00:08.685
So let's light these
tournaments up, alright?

1:00:08.685 --> 1:00:10.945
(Xavier chuckles)

1:00:10.945 --> 1:00:13.612
(intense music)

1:00:19.260 --> 1:00:20.700
- [Announcer] This afternoon's matchup

1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:22.730
features two undefeated teams,

1:00:22.730 --> 1:00:26.010
the Brighton All-Stars, who
seem to be scoring runs at will,

1:00:26.010 --> 1:00:29.888
and Freeport, coming off a
big win over the Oakwood Bats,

1:00:29.888 --> 1:00:33.221
sending them to the elimination bracket.

1:00:45.909 --> 1:00:48.992
(indistinct chatter)

1:00:55.075 --> 1:00:56.408
- [Umpire] Ball.

1:01:06.581 --> 1:01:07.414
Walk.

1:01:10.751 --> 1:01:11.940
(Lou sighs)

1:01:11.940 --> 1:01:13.660
- Well, hopefully you'll
get more from the next game,

1:01:13.660 --> 1:01:15.087
I'm sorry about that, Lou.

1:01:15.087 --> 1:01:16.540
- Aw, come on, don't sweat it, kid.

1:01:16.540 --> 1:01:18.710
If he's as good as you say he is,

1:01:18.710 --> 1:01:20.530
I'd walk him every time too.

1:01:20.530 --> 1:01:22.080
- You sticking around?

1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:23.550
- Yeah, I'm gonna catch some
of the Babe Ruth tournaments.

1:01:23.550 --> 1:01:25.250
There's a lot of talent out there.

1:01:26.810 --> 1:01:28.910
Alright, uh, I'll call you later, alright?

1:01:28.910 --> 1:01:29.910
- Yeah, sounds good.

1:01:34.947 --> 1:01:36.827
- Ball, that's a walk.

1:01:36.827 --> 1:01:40.160
(cheering and applause)

1:01:44.653 --> 1:01:46.487
- How's the arm?

1:01:46.487 --> 1:01:47.650
You did great.

1:01:47.650 --> 1:01:49.260
Head out and take center.

1:01:49.260 --> 1:01:50.800
- Coach.

1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:52.663
- Come on, we gotta save Jared's arm.

1:01:55.730 --> 1:01:56.563
Tommy!

1:01:58.620 --> 1:01:59.620
- [Catcher] Why him?

1:02:04.910 --> 1:02:06.610
- Alright, buddy, ready to have some fun?

1:02:06.610 --> 1:02:07.443
- Yeah.

1:02:07.443 --> 1:02:09.611
- Alright, just relax
and throw strikes, okay?

1:02:09.611 --> 1:02:10.444
- Yeah.

1:02:10.444 --> 1:02:12.034
- Alright, do your thing.

1:02:12.034 --> 1:02:17.034
Let's go!
(cheering and applause)

1:02:18.885 --> 1:02:20.135
Come on, Tommy!

1:02:27.515 --> 1:02:28.348
(crowd gasps)

1:02:28.348 --> 1:02:29.348
- Dead ball!

1:02:32.437 --> 1:02:33.270
- Blue.

1:02:38.387 --> 1:02:39.220
You nervous?

1:02:39.220 --> 1:02:40.053
- A little bit.

1:02:40.053 --> 1:02:42.230
- That's okay, you're overthrowing,

1:02:42.230 --> 1:02:44.580
just take a little something
off it and throw strikes, okay?

1:02:44.580 --> 1:02:45.413
- Mm-hmm.

1:02:46.460 --> 1:02:48.557
- Say, guys, let's have some fun.

1:02:48.557 --> 1:02:49.632
Just playing catch.

1:02:49.632 --> 1:02:52.632
- It's okay, throw strikes, alright?

1:02:53.602 --> 1:02:56.935
(cheering and applause)

1:03:02.735 --> 1:03:06.068
(cheering and applause)

1:03:09.513 --> 1:03:12.846
(cheering and applause)

1:03:16.164 --> 1:03:19.497
(cheering and applause)

1:03:41.719 --> 1:03:44.219
(tense music)

1:03:52.117 --> 1:03:54.000
- This kid's 12?

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:55.253
- Just turned 13.

1:03:56.240 --> 1:03:58.863
His dad was in the Dodgers'
bullpen for six years.

1:03:59.780 --> 1:04:00.613
- Great.

1:04:24.775 --> 1:04:25.608
- Strike!

1:04:27.640 --> 1:04:29.770
- Okay, Cam, now you've seen one.

1:04:29.770 --> 1:04:31.120
Give his next pitch a ride.

1:04:39.135 --> 1:04:42.468
(cheering and applause)

1:04:44.970 --> 1:04:46.350
That's alright, it's only one.

1:04:46.350 --> 1:04:47.600
Come on, Ricky, let's go!

1:05:00.011 --> 1:05:00.844
- Strike!

1:05:07.310 --> 1:05:09.723
- Good cut, Ricky, timing now, let's go!

1:05:14.932 --> 1:05:16.364
- Strike!

1:05:16.364 --> 1:05:21.364
- That's alright, that wasn't
your pitch, get him next time.

1:05:27.492 --> 1:05:28.325
- Strike!

1:05:30.033 --> 1:05:30.866
- That's alright.

1:05:30.866 --> 1:05:32.723
Come on, guys, we've still got this.

1:05:37.940 --> 1:05:40.203
Hey, it's alright, come
on, guys, let's go!

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.250
We can do a lot with two, right, Coach?

1:05:46.671 --> 1:05:47.754
Right, Coach?

1:05:52.160 --> 1:05:55.103
- Kyle, go have a seat, this game's over.

1:05:58.200 --> 1:05:59.050
- Let's go, Joey!

1:06:00.281 --> 1:06:02.948
(intense music)

1:06:13.867 --> 1:06:14.700
- [Rick] Way to go, Mason,

1:06:14.700 --> 1:06:16.413
one more pitch, buddy, one more pitch!

1:06:17.373 --> 1:06:19.290
- [Chad] Come on, Mase.

1:06:23.994 --> 1:06:25.522
(cheering and applause)

1:06:25.522 --> 1:06:26.355
- Up!

1:06:28.762 --> 1:06:29.622
(cheering and applause)

1:06:29.622 --> 1:06:30.643
- Yeah!

1:06:30.643 --> 1:06:31.476
Nice!

1:06:33.323 --> 1:06:34.912
Way to go, buddy!

1:06:34.912 --> 1:06:36.222
Good job!

1:06:36.222 --> 1:06:37.923
Good job, boys!

1:06:37.923 --> 1:06:40.590
(intense music)

1:06:44.200 --> 1:06:46.090
Alright, Bats on three, one, two, three,

1:06:46.090 --> 1:06:47.270

1:06:49.251 --> 1:06:50.084
- Alright!

1:06:50.084 --> 1:06:52.880
Great win out there
today, boys, great win.

1:06:52.880 --> 1:06:55.480
Now listen, we're probably
gonna see these guys

1:06:55.480 --> 1:06:56.880
again in the championship.

1:06:56.880 --> 1:06:57.780
- [Troy] He's right.

1:06:57.780 --> 1:06:59.800
- We got a little lucky.

1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:02.740
They could afford to lose a
game, so they held their aces,

1:07:02.740 --> 1:07:04.400
but they have to play them tomorrow,

1:07:04.400 --> 1:07:06.220
which means that their arms

1:07:06.220 --> 1:07:08.310
are gonna be tired when they play us.

1:07:08.310 --> 1:07:10.110
We are winning the championship,

1:07:10.110 --> 1:07:11.580
we are winning the regionals,

1:07:11.580 --> 1:07:13.970
and we are going to
the World Series, yeah?

1:07:13.970 --> 1:07:15.270
- Yeah!
- You got that?

1:07:15.270 --> 1:07:16.440
- Yeah!
- You got that?

1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:17.629
- Yeah!
- One, two, three,

1:07:17.629 --> 1:07:18.462
- [All] Oakwood!

1:07:18.462 --> 1:07:19.313
- One, two, three,

1:07:19.313 --> 1:07:20.146
- Oakwood!
- One, two, three,

1:07:20.146 --> 1:07:21.162
- [All] Oakwood!

1:07:21.162 --> 1:07:21.995
- Yeah!

1:07:21.995 --> 1:07:22.967
- Yeah!
- Woo!

1:07:22.967 --> 1:07:25.236
(indistinct chatter)

1:07:25.236 --> 1:07:28.569
(cheering and applause)

1:07:32.498 --> 1:07:34.998
- Go on, go play center field.

1:07:37.920 --> 1:07:40.880
Three pitches, get us out of this, okay?

1:07:40.880 --> 1:07:42.113
You'll be good, alright?

1:07:55.773 --> 1:07:58.150
- They can't walk you now, buddy!

1:07:58.150 --> 1:07:59.403
They can't walk you now!

1:08:00.384 --> 1:08:01.384
Wait for your pitch.

1:08:11.900 --> 1:08:12.733
- Strike!

1:08:15.910 --> 1:08:16.873
- Told you he throws heat.

1:08:16.873 --> 1:08:17.706
- Mm-hmm.

1:08:31.722 --> 1:08:33.222
- [Umpire] Strike!

1:22:02.116 --> 1:22:04.183
- [Catcher] That's two.

1:22:04.183 --> 1:22:07.683
- Did that kid just throw a knuckle curve?

1:22:08.559 --> 1:22:12.559
- [Announcer] Now batting,
number 53, AJ Garcia.

1:22:20.382 --> 1:22:21.215
- Cam.

1:22:44.374 --> 1:22:45.207
- Ball.

1:22:48.964 --> 1:22:50.652
(Ted chuckles)

1:22:50.652 --> 1:22:52.380
- What's he doing?

1:22:52.380 --> 1:22:55.630
- He's about to teach a bully a lesson.

1:22:56.927 --> 1:22:57.760
Hey.
- Hi.

1:23:00.039 --> 1:23:00.887
- Is he pitching?

1:23:00.887 --> 1:23:02.108
- Yeah.

1:23:02.108 --> 1:23:03.916
How'd it go?

1:23:03.916 --> 1:23:05.635
- I let up one.

1:23:05.635 --> 1:23:07.155
- Yeah.

1:23:07.155 --> 1:23:08.655
- What's he doing?

1:23:12.903 --> 1:23:15.236
- Ball four, take your base.

1:23:17.045 --> 1:23:22.045
- [Announcer] Now batting,
number 33, Mason Hastings.

1:23:24.130 --> 1:23:26.230
- That shiny new bat's not gonna help you.

1:23:27.666 --> 1:23:29.648
- You're the winning run, come on now.

1:23:29.648 --> 1:23:30.815
Let's rip one.

1:23:36.630 --> 1:23:38.965
- [Announcer] Looks like Cooke
is gonna stay in the windup

1:23:38.965 --> 1:23:41.058
and focus on the batter.

1:23:41.058 --> 1:23:43.558
(tense music)

1:23:54.018 --> 1:23:57.351
(cheering and applause)

1:23:59.320 --> 1:24:01.487
- You gotta be kidding me.

1:24:03.589 --> 1:24:05.468
- What the record for 12-year-old?

1:24:05.468 --> 1:24:06.968
- Well, it was 81.

1:24:07.900 --> 1:24:08.733
- Come on,

1:24:08.733 --> 1:24:12.536
get around early and drive
that fastball, come on!

1:24:12.536 --> 1:24:14.500
- That wasn't my fastball.

1:24:14.500 --> 1:24:15.950
Do you wanna see my fastball?

1:24:31.032 --> 1:24:31.865
(cheering and applause)

1:24:31.865 --> 1:24:32.698
- Strike.

1:24:39.208 --> 1:24:41.879
- Hey, this kid's superhuman.

1:24:41.879 --> 1:24:45.540
A 12-year-old arm cannot throw that hard.

1:24:45.540 --> 1:24:46.373
- Hey, Coach,

1:24:47.549 --> 1:24:50.080
how'd you like if he threw
that at your son's head?

1:24:52.421 --> 1:24:54.921
(tense music)

1:25:01.469 --> 1:25:03.621
- Come on, throw that again.

1:25:03.621 --> 1:25:05.270
- I can throw harder if you want.

1:25:05.270 --> 1:25:06.103
- Bring it on.

1:25:09.390 --> 1:25:10.640
- You ready for the heat?

1:25:15.709 --> 1:25:19.708
(cheering and applause)

1:25:19.708 --> 1:25:22.077
- Strike three!
(players celebrate)

1:25:22.077 --> 1:25:23.685
(cheering and applause)

1:25:23.685 --> 1:25:25.765
- (claps) Good game.

1:25:25.765 --> 1:25:29.034
(players celebrate)

1:25:29.034 --> 1:25:31.451
- [Players] Kyle! Kyle! Kyle!

1:25:33.301 --> 1:25:36.221
- [Announcer] Congratulations
to the Brighton All-Stars,

1:25:36.221 --> 1:25:39.482
our Connecticut state champions.

1:25:39.482 --> 1:25:42.806
The final score, Brighton
two, Oakwood one.

1:25:42.806 --> 1:25:46.520
Good luck at regionals,
boys, make us proud.

1:25:46.520 --> 1:25:51.520
(players celebrate)
(cheering and applause)

1:26:16.890 --> 1:26:17.723
- Hey, Ted,

1:26:20.630 --> 1:26:21.663
you got a second?

1:26:28.500 --> 1:26:29.540
- Hey, Chad.

1:26:29.540 --> 1:26:30.710
- Hey.

1:26:30.710 --> 1:26:31.543
Uh...

1:26:33.300 --> 1:26:34.170
I was...

1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:38.870
I was wrong not to give
Kyle a shot last year,

1:26:38.870 --> 1:26:40.653
him and a lotta other kids.

1:26:42.105 --> 1:26:42.938
(soft music)

1:26:42.938 --> 1:26:44.160
I'm really sorry about that.

1:26:45.630 --> 1:26:46.463
Your son,

1:26:47.810 --> 1:26:51.113
he's the greatest baseball
player I've ever seen, ever.

1:26:54.240 --> 1:26:55.200
- Listen, I...

1:26:56.930 --> 1:26:58.055
I'm sorry too.

1:26:58.055 --> 1:27:00.590
- No. (chuckles)
- I was, you know...

1:27:00.590 --> 1:27:02.653
Well, in a way, I should be thanking you.

1:27:04.175 --> 1:27:05.470
I don't think Kyle woulda worked that hard

1:27:05.470 --> 1:27:06.570
if he hadn't been cut.

1:27:08.390 --> 1:27:09.790
- Funny how things work out.

1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:17.225
- [Lou] Good game, Coach.

1:27:17.225 --> 1:27:18.058
- Thanks.

1:27:19.940 --> 1:27:22.633
- Excuse me, Mr. Cooke, Mrs. Cooke,

1:27:25.610 --> 1:27:26.490
I'm Lou Grey,

1:27:26.490 --> 1:27:27.390
I head up scouting

1:27:27.390 --> 1:27:29.860
for Stanford University's
baseball program.

1:27:29.860 --> 1:27:33.355
I'd like to talk to you about
your son if you have a moment.

1:27:33.355 --> 1:27:34.188
(Ted chuckles)

1:27:34.188 --> 1:27:36.380
- Isn't that some sort of,
uh, recruiting violation?

1:27:36.380 --> 1:27:39.071
I mean, Kyle's only
going into eighth grade.

1:27:39.071 --> 1:27:40.770
- (chuckles) Oh, no, no, no,

1:27:40.770 --> 1:27:42.820
I don't think Kyle's right for Stanford.

1:27:42.820 --> 1:27:44.300
This is about Xavier.

1:27:44.300 --> 1:27:46.310
Look, I caught a couple
of his games this week,

1:27:46.310 --> 1:27:47.930
and I think with a little
work on his breaking ball,

1:27:47.930 --> 1:27:49.927
and if his grades are good,

1:27:49.927 --> 1:27:50.760
I think we'd be interested

1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:53.120
in offering him a full scholarship.

1:27:53.120 --> 1:27:54.490
So you know,

1:27:54.490 --> 1:27:57.533
that's about a $300,000 investment
on our part in your son.

1:28:01.937 --> 1:28:03.510
Uh, alright, alright, look, (Ted chuckles)

1:28:03.510 --> 1:28:06.333
I realize this is coming
out of, well, left field.

1:28:07.830 --> 1:28:09.000
Here's my card,

1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:09.996
why don't you guys talk about it

1:28:09.996 --> 1:28:10.970
and give me a call in a day or two

1:28:10.970 --> 1:28:13.380
and maybe we can discuss
this further, alright?

1:28:13.380 --> 1:28:14.213
Pleasure meeting you.

1:28:14.213 --> 1:28:15.399
- Pleasure to meet you.

1:28:15.399 --> 1:28:16.972
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1:28:16.972 --> 1:28:18.732
Have a good day.

1:28:18.732 --> 1:28:20.830
- Uh, Mr. Grey,

1:28:20.830 --> 1:28:22.683
uh, just curious,

1:28:23.870 --> 1:28:26.313
why don't you think
Stanford's right for Kyle?

1:28:26.313 --> 1:28:28.220
(Lou chuckles)

1:28:28.220 --> 1:28:30.800
- Look, um, as a recruiting coach,

1:28:30.800 --> 1:28:32.630
I travel around the world all year long

1:28:32.630 --> 1:28:35.150
looking at young ballplayers, Mr. Cooke,

1:28:35.150 --> 1:28:37.410
there's no question in my mind
that in a couple of years,

1:28:37.410 --> 1:28:40.360
Kyle will be the number one
prospect on this entire planet.

1:28:41.210 --> 1:28:43.010
In fact, the day he graduates high school,

1:28:43.010 --> 1:28:45.040
some major league organization
will be offering you

1:28:45.040 --> 1:28:47.770
a hundred-million-dollar contract.

1:28:47.770 --> 1:28:49.670
Even Stanford can't compete with that.

1:28:50.740 --> 1:28:53.010
Look, um, I have to say this,

1:28:53.010 --> 1:28:53.843
obviously,

1:28:53.843 --> 1:28:55.803
you got a couple of great
ballplayers in your boys,

1:28:56.751 --> 1:28:57.584
from what I've seen,

1:28:57.584 --> 1:29:00.023
their interaction with
their coaches, teammates,

1:29:00.930 --> 1:29:03.093
you two have raised two fine young men.

1:29:03.940 --> 1:29:04.940
You should be proud.

1:29:06.092 --> 1:29:07.690
Well, look, I shouldn't
tie you up any longer.

1:29:07.690 --> 1:29:09.080
It's a pleasure meeting you.

1:29:09.080 --> 1:29:11.580
I look forward to talking some more.

1:29:11.580 --> 1:29:13.164
Have a great evening.

1:29:13.164 --> 1:29:14.831
Be well, my friends.

1:29:16.844 --> 1:29:19.261
(soft music)

1:30:08.925 --> 1:30:11.508
(upbeat music)

1:30:53.622 --> 1:30:56.205
(upbeat music)
