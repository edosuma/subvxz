WEBVTT

00:01.714 --> 00:03.772
I said terrible things to Alex.

00:03.772 --> 00:06.148
I stole the dress from
you, and I'm just sorry.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.309
You are not my model any more.

00:08.497 --> 00:10.402
If you gonna sign with
me, you need to know that

00:10.401 --> 00:13.974
I plan on falling completely
and insanely in love with Quinn.

00:15.689 --> 00:18.157
The record company wants me to tour

00:18.225 --> 00:19.391
in support of my new album.

00:19.459 --> 00:22.294
I'm supposed to leave next week.

00:22.362 --> 00:24.625
I think you should take another movie.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.285
And what about us?

00:26.352 --> 00:28.284
I'm saying I need some time.

00:28.352 --> 00:29.319
Alex!

00:29.387 --> 00:30.792
Hey! Alex!

00:33.840 --> 00:35.043
Let's make our movie.

00:38.510 --> 00:39.475
I'm Alexander Coyne.

00:39.543 --> 00:41.076
I'm your new designer.

00:47.408 --> 00:49.159
Don't call it a comeback

00:49.226 --> 00:50.785
She's been here for years

00:50.853 --> 00:52.750
rockin' her peers and
puttin' suckas in fear.

00:52.814 --> 00:54.478
I'm gonna knock you out.

00:54.545 --> 00:56.474
Mama said knock you out.

00:56.542 --> 00:58.506
I'm gonna knock you out.

00:58.574 --> 01:00.539
Mama said knock you out.

01:02.473 --> 01:04.305
Okay.

01:04.373 --> 01:05.504
Good luck, mom.

01:05.573 --> 01:06.804
Thanks, baby.

01:06.871 --> 01:08.970
Good luck.

01:09.038 --> 01:10.968

Clothes For Bros,

02:21.291 --> 02:23.788
COB's first venture into men's design.

02:23.855 --> 02:25.821
And to help launch our new line,

02:25.889 --> 02:29.156
I'd like to introduce you to
our new creative consultant,

02:29.224 --> 02:31.791
and my co-designer, Alexander Coyne.

02:31.859 --> 02:33.326
Thank you, Brooke. Happy to be here.

02:34.860 --> 02:38.028
* That blackbird, that robin *

02:38.095 --> 02:41.162

and time to search for... *

02:50.402 --> 02:53.670
So, how are you feeling today?

02:57.674 --> 03:00.608
Better than yesterday.

03:00.676 --> 03:03.510
That's all you can ask for.

03:11.283 --> 03:18.487
These days you aren't
keeping distinguished company

03:18.555 --> 03:25.059
* The blackbird, the
robin, that tiny honeybee *

03:25.127 --> 03:29.395
* I miss you, my lover *

03:29.463 --> 03:32.698
* You've gone through space and time *

You're good. So am I.

03:55.983 --> 04:05.288

04:28.472 --> 04:30.403
Six weeks of mail.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.639
Six weeks of junk.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.107
See, this is the inside of the tour bus.

04:35.175 --> 04:37.643
And I had a bunk bed
with a pull-down tv.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.445
And one night they made
me an honorary roadie.

04:40.513 --> 04:42.079
Whoa!

04:42.147 --> 04:43.180
Us roadies do all the real work.

04:43.248 --> 04:45.083
Hey, I heard that.

04:45.151 --> 04:46.922
This is so cool, Jamie.

04:46.990 --> 04:48.858
So, are you coming to the show
tonight? It's the last one.

04:48.925 --> 04:50.159
You bet I am.

04:50.227 --> 04:51.995
Cool. You can meet my road dogs.

04:52.063 --> 04:54.598
See you later, buddy.

04:54.666 --> 04:58.469
I swear he'd rather
live on that tour bus.

04:58.537 --> 04:59.703
That's for you.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.186
Tastes like three.

05:23.589 --> 05:25.223
Uh...

05:25.290 --> 05:26.624
Calliope.

05:26.691 --> 05:27.857
God bless you.

05:27.925 --> 05:29.659
Um, my daughter is flying back today.

05:29.726 --> 05:32.061
We need to make a good impression,
like answering the phone.

05:32.128 --> 05:34.597
Oh, of course, Ms. Davis.

05:34.665 --> 05:36.766
The phone. Answer it.

05:36.834 --> 05:39.402
Oh! Yes.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.703
Clothes Over Bros.

05:41.771 --> 05:43.472
Millicent?

05:43.539 --> 05:46.474
I'm sorry, she doesn't
work here anymore.

05:46.542 --> 05:48.410
Millicent Huxtable,

05:48.477 --> 05:51.480
you are before this court
on a drunk-driving charge.

05:51.547 --> 05:53.548
Driving drunk is a selfish crime,

05:53.616 --> 05:55.650
and this court has no tolerance for it.

05:55.718 --> 05:58.353
You are heading down a dangerous path.

05:58.421 --> 06:02.092
Now, I understand you
were just recently fired.

06:02.159 --> 06:03.527
You don't have a job...

06:03.594 --> 06:04.861
Your Honor...

06:04.929 --> 06:05.895
She does have a job.

06:07.297 --> 06:08.931
She works for me.

06:08.999 --> 06:10.766
You work for me, remember?

06:10.833 --> 06:12.200
I know, boss.

06:12.268 --> 06:14.069
I just... I think the
board liked me better.

06:14.137 --> 06:17.806
They like your track record
of making a butt-load of money,

06:17.873 --> 06:19.107
and...

06:19.175 --> 06:21.010
Julian?

06:21.078 --> 06:22.078
Brooke.

06:22.146 --> 06:23.112
Hi.

06:23.180 --> 06:24.680
Hi.

06:24.748 --> 06:26.815
Hi. Alexander Coyne.

06:26.883 --> 06:28.450
Julian Baker.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.619
It's... it's been...

06:30.686 --> 06:31.819
six weeks.

06:31.887 --> 06:33.020
We haven't talked in six weeks, Brooke.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.589
How did you know I
was coming home today?

06:35.657 --> 06:38.025
I'm okay. And I didn't.

06:38.092 --> 06:39.193
Oh. Then why are you...

06:39.260 --> 06:40.761
Julian!

06:40.829 --> 06:42.462
Sorry. The flight was late.

06:42.530 --> 06:45.164
I swear that ratty airline
blanket gave me cooties.

06:45.232 --> 06:46.966
Of course.

06:47.033 --> 06:48.433
Hey, Brooke.

06:48.501 --> 06:50.402
Alex.

06:51.904 --> 06:53.371
Bye, Julian.

07:01.734 --> 07:04.902
I told you. No spiders... nothing.

07:05.279 --> 07:05.961
I'm sorry.

07:05.961 --> 07:07.630
I just haven't slept
in this bed in weeks.

07:07.630 --> 07:10.098
Ugh, it happened one time when
we got home from sleepaway camp.

07:10.166 --> 07:11.366
One time, eight legs,

07:11.434 --> 07:13.068
and a friggin' hundred nightmares later!

07:13.135 --> 07:16.037
Ugh, bed, I've missed you.

07:16.105 --> 07:18.406
I missed my favorite baby sis!

07:18.473 --> 07:21.075
So...

07:21.143 --> 07:22.676
the thing in the mail...

07:22.744 --> 07:24.411
is that what I think it is?

07:24.479 --> 07:25.545
Yeah.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.914
I'm divorced... officially.

07:27.982 --> 07:29.582
Are you okay?

07:29.649 --> 07:31.650
I've been divorced for a while now.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.685
The paper just makes it official.

07:33.753 --> 07:35.520
Clay probably makes it easier.

07:35.588 --> 07:36.821
What's up with you two?

07:38.290 --> 07:39.558
We're good, you know?

07:39.626 --> 07:41.293
I haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.

07:41.361 --> 07:44.062
He's been out scouting,
but we texted all the time.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.931
He comes home today.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.566
And you're totally nervous,

07:47.634 --> 07:50.068
because you're doing that
"I like a boy" face twitch.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.970
Face twitch. What...

07:52.038 --> 07:53.639
like...

07:53.706 --> 07:54.940
Shut up, Hales!

07:56.642 --> 07:58.009
It's cute, really.

07:58.077 --> 08:00.812
Fine. Good luck with the black
widow I saw on your pillow.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.347
What?!

08:04.250 --> 08:06.317
I hate you.

08:06.385 --> 08:07.886
I know you don't do
something for nothing,

08:07.953 --> 08:10.021
so what do you want, Victoria?

08:10.089 --> 08:13.725
I'm sorry, does that mean
"thank you" in coke-whore land?

08:13.792 --> 08:17.594
Yes, I know about your little habit...

08:17.662 --> 08:19.229
And your sad, little compulsion

08:19.297 --> 08:22.432
to take dresses that
don't belong to you.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.067
Are you still doing the drugs?

08:24.135 --> 08:25.335
Today? No.

08:25.403 --> 08:26.502
No or not yet?

08:26.570 --> 08:27.770
Are we done here?

08:27.838 --> 08:29.138
I'm sorry to hold you.

08:29.206 --> 08:31.039
You must have mirrors to clean.

08:31.107 --> 08:33.640
Look, I meant what I said in there.

08:33.707 --> 08:36.176
You can come back to
clothes over bros...

08:36.244 --> 08:37.910
As my assistant.

08:40.881 --> 08:42.547
Why would you help me?

08:43.950 --> 08:45.852
Because, clearly, you need it.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.354
Look, it's a second chance,

08:47.422 --> 08:50.456
and believe me, they don't
come around that often.

08:52.492 --> 08:54.059
The choice is yours.

08:59.431 --> 09:00.899
Jamie, come on.

09:00.966 --> 09:02.433
Sorry, dad.

09:02.501 --> 09:05.369
Had to get my tour-bus book
to show Chuck and the guys.

09:05.437 --> 09:07.671
Bet they've never even see.

09:09.807 --> 09:11.007
Clay!

09:11.074 --> 09:12.174
Hey, Nate. What's up, man?

09:12.242 --> 09:14.175
- Uncle Clay!
- What's up, buddy?

09:14.243 --> 09:16.510
Aunt Quinn, uncle Clay's here!

09:16.578 --> 09:18.278
Dude, got to tell you about the tour.

09:18.346 --> 09:20.046
Later, okay? I'll be in the car, dad.

09:20.114 --> 09:21.513
All right, Jamie.

09:21.581 --> 09:22.980
So, when'd you get in, man?

09:23.048 --> 09:24.415
Landed this morning.

09:24.482 --> 09:26.916
I wanted to deliver the
endorsement contracts in person.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.917
Oh... thanks, man.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.552
Just taking care of my client.

09:30.619 --> 09:32.686
Clay, you're home!

09:32.754 --> 09:33.753
Hey, there.

09:36.958 --> 09:38.591
Uh, well, Jamie's waiting.

09:38.659 --> 09:40.524
So, I... I better go. I'll see you guys.

09:40.592 --> 09:41.527
Bye, Nate.

09:43.229 --> 09:45.163
Welcome home.

09:53.705 --> 09:55.072
Oh.

09:55.140 --> 09:57.107
I'm more of a vodka girl,

09:57.175 --> 09:58.908
and we have a lot of work to do.

09:58.976 --> 10:00.142
And we can do it later.

10:00.210 --> 10:02.043
Hey, we worked our
asses off for six weeks,

10:02.111 --> 10:03.511
and the board loved the pitch.

10:03.579 --> 10:05.113
It's gonna be a hit.

10:05.181 --> 10:06.481
Oh, come on.

10:06.549 --> 10:07.949
A smile would be nice.

10:08.017 --> 10:10.117
One sip.

10:15.656 --> 10:16.590
Hit me.

10:17.961 --> 10:22.300
Um, so, what's the deal
with you, that Julian guy,

10:22.368 --> 10:23.535
and the hot girl?

10:23.602 --> 10:25.538
Do you like your job?

10:25.605 --> 10:26.939
Uh, yeah.

10:27.007 --> 10:29.074
Then don't call skanky
Alex "the hot girl,"

10:29.142 --> 10:30.842
and don't ask me about Julian.

10:30.910 --> 10:32.477
Okay, sorry, it's just that, you know,

10:32.545 --> 10:34.212
we've been working together
nonstop for weeks now,

10:34.279 --> 10:35.680
and all I know about you

10:35.747 --> 10:37.481
is that you like to order
Chinese after midnight

10:37.549 --> 10:39.984
and you sketch well.

10:40.052 --> 10:41.352
You sketch great.

10:41.420 --> 10:43.320
Really great. Come on.

10:43.388 --> 10:46.424
Hey, I talk to you about
my girlfriends all the time.

10:46.492 --> 10:48.092
I would hardly call

10:48.160 --> 10:50.728
your one-night stands " girlfriends."

10:50.796 --> 10:52.931
And I don't want to talk.

10:52.998 --> 10:54.432
Okay? I want to work.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.168
It's what I do when I'm pissed off.

10:56.236 --> 10:57.938
Yeah, well, especially with guys...

10:58.006 --> 11:00.374
hence the whole Clothes
Over Bros empire.

11:01.843 --> 11:03.377
Look, Brooke,

11:03.445 --> 11:04.746
I know it's not my place,

11:04.813 --> 11:07.849
but, I mean, your work
should be your passion,

11:07.916 --> 11:10.951
not a place you hide
when your love life sucks.

11:11.052 --> 11:14.688
Well, my sucky love life has
made me a very rich girl...

11:14.756 --> 11:16.924
rich enough to afford you.

11:16.991 --> 11:19.592
So, how 'bout you help
me and earn your keep?

11:19.660 --> 11:20.994
Whatever you say, boss.

11:21.061 --> 11:23.362
I like it when you call me "boss."

11:23.430 --> 11:26.065
Well, I'm glad, boss.

11:29.203 --> 11:30.937
You know, that guy's a fool, by the way.

11:31.004 --> 11:32.605
That sucky love-life guy.

11:32.673 --> 11:36.475
I mean, what kind of idiot
treats Brooke Davis poorly?

11:41.614 --> 11:44.816
You've been so sweet to me. Thanks.

11:44.884 --> 11:47.252
First-class treatment
for the star of my movie.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.755
I need you rested and
ready to shoot next week.

11:49.822 --> 11:51.990
Aye aye, captain.

11:52.058 --> 11:54.292
You're just a washed-up actress

11:54.360 --> 11:56.895
that's too dumb to realize
she's chasing after a boy

11:56.963 --> 11:58.397
that has no interest in her.

11:58.465 --> 12:00.165
You okay? I could call room service,

12:00.232 --> 12:02.565
get you some food, tea.

12:02.633 --> 12:05.167
No, I'm fine. Just, uh...
just taking it all in.

12:07.303 --> 12:10.905
Souvenirs from "Stupid land."

12:10.973 --> 12:11.939
I didn't mean to stare.

12:12.007 --> 12:13.173
It's okay.

12:13.241 --> 12:15.442
No more talk about me.

12:15.510 --> 12:17.277
I don't know if you know this,

12:17.345 --> 12:18.778
but I used to be self-centered.

12:18.846 --> 12:21.814
I was so "me, me, me,
and my fab ass... me."

12:22.949 --> 12:24.149
I never noticed.

12:24.216 --> 12:26.951
Okay, I'm gonna go, let you settle in.

12:27.019 --> 12:28.085
Uh, I'll be on my cell if you need...

12:28.153 --> 12:29.253
Don't worry.

12:29.320 --> 12:31.554
I'm good. I promise.

12:31.622 --> 12:33.122
Okay. Bye.

12:33.190 --> 12:34.724
Bye.

12:46.869 --> 12:49.704
Hey, Makenna. Where's the party?

12:57.584 --> 13:00.219
Life on the road was sweet.

13:00.287 --> 13:04.189
It was rock 'n' roll
city to city, you know?

13:04.257 --> 13:06.290
Chillin' with my road dogs.

13:06.358 --> 13:09.558
One time, the bus driver
even let me drive the bus.

13:09.626 --> 13:11.326
You told us.

13:11.394 --> 13:14.028
Three times. You're on a loop, dude.

13:14.096 --> 13:15.796
Let's go.

13:15.864 --> 13:17.498
Hey, where are you going?

13:17.566 --> 13:20.768
Uh... karate practice.

13:20.836 --> 13:22.537
Like we do every Saturday.

13:22.604 --> 13:24.439
Our sensei is a time nazi.

13:26.274 --> 13:28.505
I'm glad you're back, Jamie.

13:35.645 --> 13:38.313
Welcome back.

13:38.381 --> 13:40.616
It would have been nice to get a call...

13:40.684 --> 13:42.651
E-mail, anything.

13:42.719 --> 13:44.820
We're taking some time apart.

13:44.888 --> 13:46.788
And I backed off for six weeks, but...

13:46.856 --> 13:48.190
We need to talk now.

13:48.258 --> 13:50.559
We need to figure some
things out together.

13:50.627 --> 13:53.261
If this is about you not
being able to have kids,

13:53.329 --> 13:55.330
we should be talking about that.

13:55.398 --> 13:57.966
We should be talking
about a lot of things.

13:58.034 --> 14:00.902
Things like Alex?

14:03.206 --> 14:05.540
How is she, by the way?
Seems to be on the mend.

14:05.608 --> 14:07.141
You want to talk about Alex?

14:07.209 --> 14:08.676
Okay.

14:08.744 --> 14:11.612
You told me that you want to save her,

14:11.680 --> 14:14.548
like you couldn't save your mom.

14:14.616 --> 14:16.983
What am I supposed to do with that?

14:17.051 --> 14:18.618
Understand.

14:18.686 --> 14:21.154
I can't!

14:21.222 --> 14:22.489
Oh, I see.

14:22.556 --> 14:25.058
So since you can't understand
me working with Alex,

14:25.126 --> 14:27.160
you show up in town with some guy

14:27.228 --> 14:28.795
like we're playing a game?

14:28.862 --> 14:30.796
I'm not playing a game.

14:30.864 --> 14:31.997
Really?

14:32.065 --> 14:35.134
You show up with a guy named Alexander.

14:35.201 --> 14:37.035
"Alex"?

14:37.103 --> 14:39.037
Right. No game here.

14:39.105 --> 14:42.140
My mother hired Alexander.

14:42.208 --> 14:45.410
He is consulting on my men's line!

14:45.477 --> 14:46.811
That's it!

14:46.879 --> 14:49.180
Okay. I believe you.

14:49.247 --> 14:50.547
Imagine that.

14:50.615 --> 14:53.182
I believe you.

14:53.250 --> 14:56.385
Do you think that this
has been easy for me?

14:56.453 --> 14:59.121
How would I know, Brooke?
You never talk to me about it!

14:59.189 --> 15:00.556
I've tried...

15:00.623 --> 15:01.924
you know what? I can't do this.

15:01.992 --> 15:03.592
I have a lot of work to do today.

15:03.660 --> 15:06.394
Right. Of course.

15:06.462 --> 15:08.262
Clothes over bros.

15:17.371 --> 15:19.271
What happened to all your friends?

15:19.339 --> 15:20.406
I don't know.

15:20.473 --> 15:21.640
I tried to tell them about my summer,

15:21.708 --> 15:23.075
but they shut me down.

15:23.142 --> 15:25.243
Yeah? What did they
do with their summer?

15:25.311 --> 15:27.045
I don't know.

15:27.113 --> 15:29.614
Did you ask, or did
you do all the talking?

15:29.682 --> 15:32.817
I guess I was bragging a little bit.

15:32.885 --> 15:35.253
Yeah.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.588
Look, Jamie, you get to
do a lot of cool stuff

15:37.656 --> 15:39.657
that other kids don't really get to do.

15:39.724 --> 15:41.325
NBA games. Rock tours.

15:41.393 --> 15:43.660
But the thing is, none
of that stuff matters

15:43.728 --> 15:44.994
more than your friends.

15:46.697 --> 15:47.763
You know all my friends, right?

15:47.831 --> 15:49.064
They're pretty much all the same friends

15:49.132 --> 15:50.132
that I've had for a really long time.

15:52.268 --> 15:54.469
Was skills always bald?

15:54.536 --> 15:57.271
Yeah. Pretty much.

15:57.339 --> 16:00.709
My point is, no matter how
much cool stuff I get to do,

16:00.777 --> 16:02.812
none of it matters without my friends.

16:02.879 --> 16:03.913
All right?

16:10.787 --> 16:13.422
Knock, knock! Tickets, anyone?

16:13.490 --> 16:14.790
Haley! Hey.

16:14.857 --> 16:16.891
You could have left these at will call.

16:16.958 --> 16:18.258
I can't leave a hug at will call.

16:18.326 --> 16:20.393
- Missed you.
- Missed you, too.

16:20.461 --> 16:23.563
So, excessive sketching.
What's been going on?

16:23.631 --> 16:25.398
Nothing.

16:25.466 --> 16:26.766
Brooke.

16:26.834 --> 16:29.537
It's me and Julian. I...

16:29.604 --> 16:32.307
I thought that this time
apart was gonna help,

16:32.374 --> 16:34.376
and I just feel stuck.

16:34.443 --> 16:37.045
Brooke, Julian loves
you, and you love him.

16:37.113 --> 16:39.080
That is a good place to be stuck.

16:39.148 --> 16:40.982
Yeah.

16:41.050 --> 16:43.084
But this thing with Alex, Hales...

16:44.420 --> 16:48.257
Did you ever doubt
Nathan, even for a second,

16:48.325 --> 16:50.560
during that whole mess with Renee?

16:50.628 --> 16:52.962
I'm not proud of it, but, yeah, I did.

16:53.030 --> 16:55.732
And he kept telling me the
whole time that it was nothing.

16:55.799 --> 16:58.001
Guess what... in the
end, it was nothing.

16:58.069 --> 17:00.704
Yeah, but you're Nathan and Haley.

17:00.772 --> 17:03.240
Brooke, I know trust has
always been hard for you.

17:03.308 --> 17:06.810
But Alex isn't Peyton.
And Julian is not Lucas.

17:09.849 --> 17:11.050
Want to know a secret?

17:11.117 --> 17:11.984
Huh?

17:13.887 --> 17:15.354
I'm kind of nervous.

17:15.421 --> 17:16.688
Why?

17:16.755 --> 17:18.289
I don't know. Because...

17:18.356 --> 17:20.323
'cause I haven't seen you, and...

17:20.390 --> 17:22.624
You give me butterflies...
there. I said it!

17:23.992 --> 17:25.425
I was nervous, too.

17:26.595 --> 17:27.628
Really?

17:27.695 --> 17:29.396
Yeah.

17:29.463 --> 17:31.261
After that whole public declaration

17:31.329 --> 17:33.560
about falling insanely in love with you?

17:33.628 --> 17:35.296
Great line, by the way.

17:35.363 --> 17:36.664
Really?

17:36.731 --> 17:38.931
I was afraid that might
have freaked you out.

17:38.999 --> 17:42.668
No. It was amazing... so romantic.

17:42.736 --> 17:45.204
And a big, huge moment.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.905
That totally freaked you out.

17:46.973 --> 17:48.207
A little

17:48.274 --> 17:50.609
but only because it had
the potential to be true.

17:50.677 --> 17:54.279
Or it has the potential to be true.

17:54.347 --> 17:57.949
I tell you what. Let's take things slow.

17:58.017 --> 18:01.486
No pressure. No more
big public declarations.

18:01.554 --> 18:03.154
Let's start small...

18:03.222 --> 18:04.289
Like a date.

18:06.359 --> 18:07.559
I could do a date.

18:07.626 --> 18:09.160
Good.

18:09.228 --> 18:11.997
And then after the date, we
can fall insanely in love.

18:13.633 --> 18:16.267
I could do that, too.

18:16.335 --> 18:18.870
What are you doing for lunch?

18:24.410 --> 18:26.778
Hello, Julian.

18:26.846 --> 18:28.713
I hear the chicken's good today.

18:28.781 --> 18:30.915
Brooke and I are taking some time apart.

18:30.983 --> 18:33.151
I don't need you pushing
another guy on her.

18:33.218 --> 18:35.320
I'm not pushing anything.

18:35.387 --> 18:36.387
Victoria...

18:36.455 --> 18:37.722
Julian...

18:37.789 --> 18:40.591
I like you.

18:40.659 --> 18:42.593
But Brooke deserves to be with someone

18:42.661 --> 18:44.328
who has the good sense to want her

18:44.396 --> 18:46.063
over some no-talent actress.

18:46.131 --> 18:48.099
Well, if that's Alexander, then...

18:48.166 --> 18:50.201
I'm not interested in Alex.

18:50.269 --> 18:51.936
I've seen you with her.

18:52.003 --> 18:54.405
You may not be interested in her,

18:54.473 --> 18:57.441
but you like that
she's interested in you.

18:57.509 --> 19:00.110
You want to stroke your ego?

19:00.178 --> 19:02.746
Don't break my
daughter's heart to do it.

19:02.813 --> 19:04.514
Brooke's heart was already broken

19:04.581 --> 19:05.748
when I met her.

19:05.816 --> 19:07.417
But you know that since you broke it.

19:07.484 --> 19:09.119
I've been the one trying to mend it.

19:09.187 --> 19:11.555
Well, right now, you're
not doing a good job.

19:11.623 --> 19:12.990
You want Brooke?

19:13.057 --> 19:15.859
Stand up and be that hero that
you put in all your movies.

19:15.927 --> 19:17.294
Fight for her.

19:17.362 --> 19:19.896
I have been. I can't
fight for us by myself.

19:19.964 --> 19:21.698
Look...

19:21.766 --> 19:23.900
Victoria, I'm not the bad guy here.

19:23.968 --> 19:26.569
You want to help your
daughter? Tell her that.

19:41.518 --> 19:43.018
Hey, bitch.

19:43.086 --> 19:45.254
I thought you, like, died or something.

19:45.321 --> 19:47.155
No. That was your career.

19:47.223 --> 19:49.224
Damn. It was a joke. Chill.

19:49.292 --> 19:50.592
Where's Millie?

19:50.660 --> 19:53.128
I don't know. Call
1-800-snow nose.

20:02.505 --> 20:03.938
What are you doing?!

20:04.006 --> 20:05.339
- Taking you home.
- Why?

20:05.407 --> 20:07.241
Because nobody did it for me.

20:07.309 --> 20:09.243
Let's go.

20:09.311 --> 20:11.778
You did your good deed. Now you can go.

20:11.846 --> 20:14.015
No, I'm coming in. We need to talk.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.216
Fine. Come in.

20:17.320 --> 20:19.220
My God, Millie!

20:19.288 --> 20:21.155
Screw you, Alex.

20:33.416 --> 20:33.814
Wow.

20:33.814 --> 20:36.249
Olives, cheddar bunnies,
and brownie bites.

20:37.384 --> 20:39.986
And root beer.

20:40.054 --> 20:43.122
I am such a cheap first date.

20:43.189 --> 20:44.823
You know, I haven't
been home in a few weeks.

20:44.891 --> 20:46.992
There wasn't a whole lot
in the kitchen to work with.

20:47.059 --> 20:49.394
Yeah, with this menu, you're not
really gonna get a first-date kiss.

20:49.462 --> 20:51.329
So you kiss on the first date.

20:51.397 --> 20:52.965
Never. Mnh-mnh.

20:53.032 --> 20:54.500
So you're a tease.

20:54.568 --> 20:56.903
Oh, and here I was saving
the last brownie bite for you.

20:56.970 --> 20:58.304
No, you don't! What...

20:58.372 --> 20:59.873
mm, mm, mm. Mmm!

21:01.341 --> 21:02.841
Mm-hmm.

21:02.909 --> 21:03.875
So good.

21:03.943 --> 21:04.909
So tell me...

21:04.977 --> 21:08.212
best first-date story.

21:08.280 --> 21:09.747
Bobby Hobbs.

21:09.814 --> 21:12.849
I was 7, and he invited
me over to play basketball

21:12.917 --> 21:14.084
in his driveway.

21:14.152 --> 21:16.653
I was a serious tomboy.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.721
When I got there,

21:18.789 --> 21:20.823
he slipped me a note that says,
"will you be my girlfriend?

21:20.891 --> 21:23.058
Yes, no, maybe."

21:23.126 --> 21:24.960
Get her done, Bobby Hobbs!

21:25.028 --> 21:26.528
What?

21:26.595 --> 21:28.863
Game respects game. So what'd you say?

21:28.930 --> 21:30.096
I said "yes."

21:30.164 --> 21:31.297
And then I beat him in "horse"

21:31.365 --> 21:32.865
and made him cry like a little girl.

21:32.933 --> 21:34.633
Remind me never to play ball with you.

21:39.238 --> 21:41.139
So...

21:41.207 --> 21:42.707
Today at the house,

21:42.775 --> 21:45.277
you seemed kind of awkward
around me in front of Nathan.

21:45.345 --> 21:46.645
Yeah, you know,

21:46.712 --> 21:49.314
I think it's best to keep
it strictly professional

21:49.382 --> 21:50.849
around Nate.

21:50.916 --> 21:52.483
Yeah, but you told him

21:52.551 --> 21:55.252
you plan on falling
insanely in love with me.

21:55.320 --> 21:56.753
Okay.

21:56.821 --> 21:58.788
Doesn't mean I want to
flaunt it in his face.

21:58.856 --> 22:01.390
It... it just felt weird, I guess.

22:01.458 --> 22:02.791
Okay.

22:02.859 --> 22:04.059
But if we're gonna date,

22:04.127 --> 22:05.426
have to date outside
of this little world

22:05.494 --> 22:06.594
here at the beach house.

22:06.662 --> 22:08.596
I know.

22:08.663 --> 22:10.964
You're right.

22:11.032 --> 22:13.099
You're beautiful, and you're right.

22:13.166 --> 22:16.301
Besides, I hear they
have way better food

22:16.369 --> 22:17.502
in the real world.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.039
Okay, well, I'm gonna go to my hotel,

22:22.107 --> 22:23.540
check , get some sleep.

22:23.607 --> 22:25.007
Unless you want to grab dinner,

22:25.075 --> 22:26.542
maybe review the designs.

22:26.610 --> 22:28.044
I can't. I have plans.

22:28.111 --> 22:30.346
Oh, so, she doesn't just work.

22:30.414 --> 22:32.181
Well, you're just full
of surprises, Ms. Davis.

22:32.248 --> 22:33.315
Mm. Don't forget,

22:33.383 --> 22:34.683
we have a conference call with New York

22:34.750 --> 22:35.850
tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m.

22:35.918 --> 22:37.185
Got it.

22:38.553 --> 22:41.088
Got it, boss.

22:41.156 --> 22:43.290
Attaboy.

22:43.357 --> 22:44.858
By the way...

22:44.925 --> 22:47.093
I know I'm here for the "clothes" part,

22:47.161 --> 22:48.794
but I'm also a good listener...

22:48.862 --> 22:51.263
If you ever need to talk
about the "bros" part.

22:54.867 --> 22:56.267
Victoria.

22:56.335 --> 22:58.701
Alexander.

23:01.404 --> 23:02.637
He seems interested.

23:02.705 --> 23:05.741
Don't push, mom. It's just work.

23:05.809 --> 23:07.910
Honey, I don't want you
to be with Alexander.

23:07.978 --> 23:08.977
I want you to be happy.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.647
Do you still love Julian?

23:12.715 --> 23:14.382
Of course.

23:14.449 --> 23:15.816
Well, he came to see me today,

23:15.884 --> 23:17.818
and I told him to fight for you.

23:17.886 --> 23:19.786
But he has been fighting, hasn't he?

23:21.655 --> 23:23.588
Look...

23:23.656 --> 23:27.225
Don't let this "taking space"
be a long way to "goodbye."

23:29.495 --> 23:31.929
Bitchtoria is getting soft.

23:32.030 --> 23:34.765
I know. It's a tragedy.

23:34.833 --> 23:37.034
Speaking of tragedies,
I saw Millicent today,

23:37.101 --> 23:38.335
and I offered her a job.

23:38.402 --> 23:39.569
Mom...

23:39.637 --> 23:41.037
I know. You're disappointed in her.

23:41.038 --> 23:42.605
But I want to help.

23:42.606 --> 23:44.574
I feel... responsible.

23:46.210 --> 23:47.744
I was the one that called the police

23:47.812 --> 23:48.945
the night of the DUI.

23:49.013 --> 23:50.146
Well, you weren't the one

23:50.214 --> 23:51.848
who made Millie get in the driver's seat

23:51.916 --> 23:53.283
and drive drunk!

23:53.350 --> 23:55.184
Mom, her getting pulled over that night

23:55.252 --> 23:56.819
might have saved someone's life!

23:56.887 --> 23:59.255
Well, maybe this will help Millicent.

24:03.093 --> 24:04.560
You're right.

24:04.627 --> 24:07.028
Bitchtoria is really getting soft.

24:11.100 --> 24:12.833
Why are you still here?

24:12.901 --> 24:15.502
I'm staying until you talk to me.

24:15.570 --> 24:18.105
Well, God, what do
you want to talk about?

24:18.172 --> 24:20.240
I went to court today for a DUI,

24:20.308 --> 24:22.909
I snort powder up my
nose. And I'm by myself.

24:22.977 --> 24:24.144
Mouth moved to L.A.

24:24.212 --> 24:25.513
Can't blame him, right?

24:25.580 --> 24:27.081
He gave me a million chances.

24:27.149 --> 24:28.849
Eventually, I guess I ran out.

24:28.917 --> 24:30.517
You never run out of chances

24:30.585 --> 24:32.552
as long as you give yourself one.

24:32.620 --> 24:34.487
Wow. Nice.

24:34.555 --> 24:36.422
What "b" movie is that from?

24:36.490 --> 24:38.891
Rehab. The remake.

24:38.959 --> 24:40.660
Well, good for you.

24:40.728 --> 24:43.196
You're happy and better,
and I'm the screwed-up one!

24:43.264 --> 24:44.965
Brava, bitch!

24:45.032 --> 24:48.702
Be as nasty as you
want. Be me. Don't care.

24:48.769 --> 24:51.171
I'm staying because I love you,

24:51.238 --> 24:53.372
and I'm not giving up on you.

24:55.175 --> 24:57.809
Stop being nice to me!

24:57.877 --> 24:59.411
Stop trying to help me!

25:01.215 --> 25:04.685
I said you were washed up and stupid,

25:04.753 --> 25:08.022
and then you tried to kill yourself.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.990
I'm

25:10.058 --> 25:11.292
I'm sorry.

25:13.228 --> 25:15.262
That was my own fault...

25:15.330 --> 25:19.031
giving up because I thought
that it would be easier.

25:20.667 --> 25:22.133
Is that what you're doing?

25:22.201 --> 25:23.501
Giving up?

25:23.568 --> 25:25.869
I'm not as strong as you are, Alex.

25:25.937 --> 25:28.272
I'm not strong. But I'm... I'm here.

25:28.339 --> 25:29.873
And so are you,

25:29.941 --> 25:32.709
and we're gonna get you
back to your old self.

25:32.777 --> 25:35.245
I'm not sure I can get back there.

25:35.313 --> 25:36.913
Yes, you can.

25:36.981 --> 25:39.215
You just pick a place and you start.

25:51.521 --> 25:52.767
Whoo!

25:52.767 --> 25:54.302
Hey, guys.

25:56.278 --> 25:58.745
So, you know her as Haley James Scott,

25:58.813 --> 26:01.846
but to me, she's the coolest mom ever.

26:01.914 --> 26:04.581
Please welcome my mom!

26:21.129 --> 26:25.667
* The girl in the moon is alone *

26:25.735 --> 26:31.204
* with the stars and the spaceships *

26:31.272 --> 26:35.675
* the girl in the moon is alone *

26:35.743 --> 26:41.680
* and alive with the dust and the air *

26:41.748 --> 26:44.483
* nothing grows *

26:44.550 --> 26:48.419
* everything is moving *

26:48.487 --> 26:53.491
* but only goes in circles *

26:53.558 --> 26:57.596
* and no one to talk
to is reason enough *

26:57.663 --> 27:01.299
* to be blue *

27:02.868 --> 27:05.403
Thanks.

27:05.471 --> 27:06.838
What are you doing here?

27:06.906 --> 27:08.072
Rehab for my rep.

27:08.140 --> 27:09.874
It's the hottest ticket in town.

27:09.942 --> 27:11.943
Not showing up is more cause for gossip.

27:12.011 --> 27:13.345
Oh. Okay.

27:13.412 --> 27:15.680
Well, uh...

27:15.748 --> 27:17.615
First day back. You hanging in there?

27:17.683 --> 27:19.984
I'm good. I, uh, I
went to go see Millie.

27:20.052 --> 27:22.086
You ever feel like you
just want to save somebody?

27:23.522 --> 27:25.156
I don't know. Maybe.

27:25.223 --> 27:26.457
Well, you can't. I know.

27:26.525 --> 27:28.692
I got an "a" in rehab.
Now I just got to apply it.

27:28.760 --> 27:31.028
I can Dr. Phil myself
until I'm blue in the butt,

27:31.096 --> 27:32.696
but I have to get back out there,

27:32.764 --> 27:34.531
be around everything that tempts me,

27:34.599 --> 27:37.301
and learn to be okay
without all the things I want

27:37.369 --> 27:39.303
but... can't have.

27:39.370 --> 27:43.907
Learn to be okay with everybody
staring at these scars.

27:43.975 --> 27:46.310
Well, how about you get
used to that one tomorrow?

27:46.411 --> 27:47.811
Here.

27:47.879 --> 27:49.913
Here, put it on. Let them stare at that.

27:49.980 --> 27:52.113
You don't have to do this.

27:52.181 --> 27:54.015
No, it's research for our movie.

27:54.082 --> 27:57.718
Your... your character
loves to wear men's watches

27:57.785 --> 27:58.885
at concerts.

27:58.953 --> 28:00.753
No, she doesn't.

28:00.821 --> 28:02.855
Tonight she does.

28:02.923 --> 28:05.624
The girl in the moon with her dreams

28:05.691 --> 28:11.197
has a steel-melting smile

28:11.265 --> 28:15.534
but the girl with the blues in the moon

28:15.602 --> 28:21.805
hasn't smiled in a long while

28:21.873 --> 28:25.542
blue, blue, blue

28:25.610 --> 28:26.877
can I help you?

28:26.944 --> 28:29.746
Or are you gonna help yourself again?

28:29.813 --> 28:32.448
Is the job still open?

28:32.516 --> 28:35.451
I don't like to be made a fool of.

28:35.519 --> 28:37.252
I know.

28:39.122 --> 28:41.256
Very well.

28:41.323 --> 28:43.157
Then you can begin tonight.

28:43.225 --> 28:46.660
I don't know what "catastrophe"
did with your filing system,

28:46.727 --> 28:47.827
but it's a mess.

28:47.895 --> 28:50.296
Calliope is amazing.

28:50.364 --> 28:51.964
She's no Millicent.

28:55.435 --> 28:57.671
Thank you, Victoria.

28:59.207 --> 29:00.641
Get to work.

29:04.379 --> 29:07.147
Blue, blue, blue

29:09.216 --> 29:10.950
you know, no matter how
many times I see my sister,

29:11.018 --> 29:12.385
I am still blown away.

29:12.453 --> 29:14.921
Yeah, you James girls
are pretty amazing.

29:14.989 --> 29:16.356
Look at you, Mr. Smooth.

29:16.423 --> 29:18.825
Hey, I'm competing with
the infamous Bobby Hobbs.

29:18.892 --> 29:20.560
Whatever happened to him, anyway?

29:20.627 --> 29:22.528
My infamous sister Taylor. Long story.

29:22.596 --> 29:24.096
Definite fourth-date material.

29:24.164 --> 29:25.831
Hey, Quinn. Clay.

29:25.899 --> 29:27.600
What's up, Nate?

29:28.901 --> 29:30.401
Clay, can I talk to you for a sec?

29:30.469 --> 29:31.936
Sure. Yeah, can you give us a minute?

29:32.003 --> 29:32.937
No problem.

29:33.004 --> 29:34.972
Is everything all right?

29:35.039 --> 29:36.106
Yeah, everything's fine.

29:36.174 --> 29:37.608
I just wanted to talk to my friend.

29:37.675 --> 29:38.709
How was your trip, man?

29:38.776 --> 29:41.144
It's good. It's good.

29:41.212 --> 29:43.246
Good.

29:43.313 --> 29:45.415
All right, look, Clay...

29:45.483 --> 29:48.351
I stayed with you because
you are a good agent

29:48.419 --> 29:50.286
and you're a good friend.

29:50.354 --> 29:53.489
And I got the agent,
but, uh, I miss my friend.

29:53.557 --> 29:54.490
Okay?

29:54.558 --> 29:55.891
Okay.

29:55.959 --> 29:58.128
Oh, and stop being weird
around Quinn in front of me.

29:58.196 --> 29:59.263
It's awkward.

29:59.330 --> 30:00.797
Yeah, I'm sorry about that, man.

30:05.603 --> 30:07.036
Say "cheese," aunt Quinn.

30:08.906 --> 30:10.072
Jame!

30:10.140 --> 30:12.374
Saw you rocking out
in the crowd earlier.

30:12.442 --> 30:13.709
Nice!

30:13.777 --> 30:16.145
Yeah. I got moves.

30:16.212 --> 30:18.414
It runs in the family.

30:18.481 --> 30:21.950
Really? Mama said you can't dance.

30:22.018 --> 30:25.421
That's so not fair!

30:25.488 --> 30:27.756
So you're sad it's the last show?

30:27.824 --> 30:30.625
No. I mean, it was fun for the summer.

30:30.693 --> 30:32.828
Now that I'm home, I miss it..

30:32.895 --> 30:34.362
I guess.

30:34.430 --> 30:36.364
My friends. My real life.

30:36.432 --> 30:37.866
I forgot how awesome it is.

30:37.934 --> 30:39.668
- It feels so good to be home!
- Yeah.

30:39.735 --> 30:41.569
It's good to have a home.

30:41.637 --> 30:43.071
Yeah. It is.

30:43.139 --> 30:44.940
To the stage!

30:54.483 --> 30:57.985
* Many times I've tried to tell you *

30:58.053 --> 31:00.855
* many times I've cried alone *

31:01.723 --> 31:04.458
* always I'm surprised how well *

31:04.526 --> 31:07.829
* you cut my feelings to the bone *

31:08.964 --> 31:12.366
* don't want to leave you really *

31:12.434 --> 31:15.002
* I've invested too much time *

31:15.770 --> 31:19.539
* to give you up that easy *

31:19.607 --> 31:23.009
* to the doubts that
complicate your mind *

31:23.077 --> 31:28.948
* we belong to the light,
we belong to the thunder *

31:29.016 --> 31:32.218
* we belong to the sound of the words *

31:32.286 --> 31:36.489
* we've both fallen under *

31:36.557 --> 31:40.092
* whatever we deny or embrace... *

31:40.160 --> 31:41.827
Julian.

31:41.895 --> 31:44.395
Hi. Hey, here you go.

31:44.463 --> 31:45.797
Alex.

31:47.900 --> 31:50.770
You guys should talk. I'll... go.

31:52.940 --> 31:55.308
All day long I've been
trying to figure out

31:55.375 --> 31:58.541
how to get past the
you-and-Alex thing,

31:58.609 --> 32:00.475
and here you are...

32:00.543 --> 32:01.676
Together.

32:01.744 --> 32:04.378
You are always together.

32:04.446 --> 32:07.280
Brooke, I bumped into her tonight.

32:07.348 --> 32:08.848
Of course.

32:08.916 --> 32:12.852
It's always about Alex!
Just stop it, Brooke!

32:12.919 --> 32:15.821
I will as soon as you stop
acting like it's in my head!

32:15.888 --> 32:17.789
- It's not!
- Yes, it is!

32:17.857 --> 32:20.925
I saw you with her in the hospital,

32:20.993 --> 32:23.461
sitting by her bed, holding her hand.

32:23.528 --> 32:25.229
That was not in my head!

32:25.297 --> 32:27.831
She tried to kill herself.

32:27.899 --> 32:29.533
I'm her friend.

32:29.601 --> 32:32.369
It was more than that. I was there!

32:32.437 --> 32:33.771
How dare you?

32:33.838 --> 32:35.339
I am here in tree hill for you,

32:35.406 --> 32:36.640
and it's not good enough.

32:36.708 --> 32:39.243
You just keep waiting for
the other shoe to drop,

32:39.310 --> 32:40.811
waiting for this not to work.

32:40.879 --> 32:43.580
I don't want to fight.
I just wanted to talk.

32:43.648 --> 32:45.515
Yet here we are fighting.

32:45.583 --> 32:48.552
And I'm getting really
tired of fighting.

32:48.619 --> 32:50.587
You know, maybe you're right.

32:50.655 --> 32:53.423
Maybe I'm the guy who
needs to save people.

32:53.491 --> 32:55.425
That's my issue.

32:55.493 --> 32:58.661
But I'm also the guy who loves you.

32:58.729 --> 33:00.397
I'm the guy you pushed away

33:00.464 --> 33:02.866
when you found out
you couldn't have kids.

33:02.933 --> 33:04.300
I'm the guy you can't trust

33:04.368 --> 33:06.035
no matter how much I tell you to.

33:06.103 --> 33:07.470
And that's your issue, Brooke.

33:07.538 --> 33:09.906
I'm never gonna be able
to make that stop for you.

33:09.974 --> 33:12.274
So what are you saying?

33:12.342 --> 33:15.211
I'm saying...

33:15.279 --> 33:17.446
maybe right now, you
need to work on you,

33:17.514 --> 33:18.948
and I need to work on me.

33:19.015 --> 33:21.450
You've got your new line, and...

33:21.518 --> 33:23.586
I'm making a movie...

33:23.653 --> 33:26.321
with Alex.

33:26.389 --> 33:28.324
I should concentrate on that.

33:31.328 --> 33:33.563
Goodbye, Brooke.

33:33.630 --> 33:35.465
* I hear your voice inside me *

33:35.532 --> 33:38.435
* I see your face everywhere *

33:38.503 --> 33:41.104
* still you say, we
belong to the light *

33:41.172 --> 33:45.308
* we belong to the thunder *

33:45.376 --> 33:48.411
* we belong to the sound of the words *

33:48.479 --> 33:52.715
* we've both fallen under *

33:52.783 --> 33:58.455
* whatever we deny or embrace,
for worse or for better *

33:58.523 --> 34:01.358
* we belong *

34:01.426 --> 34:02.760
Hey!

34:02.828 --> 34:04.061
How'd it go with Nate?

34:04.129 --> 34:05.996
Fine.

34:06.064 --> 34:07.798
Told you.

34:07.866 --> 34:09.766
He did tell me to be good to you,

34:09.835 --> 34:12.469
but I think I can handle that.

34:12.536 --> 34:14.670
You do?

34:14.739 --> 34:16.772
'Cause I can be a handful, you know.

34:16.840 --> 34:18.407
And I can't dance.

34:19.775 --> 34:21.275
And I get things wrong all the time.

34:21.344 --> 34:22.478
Like?

34:24.281 --> 34:26.382
Like kissing on the first date.

34:26.449 --> 34:28.884
I was wrong.

34:28.952 --> 34:30.920
Very wrong.

34:30.987 --> 34:33.690
Definitely wrong.

34:59.909 --> 35:01.743
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

35:01.811 --> 35:03.119
High five! You were so good, mom!

35:03.119 --> 35:05.087
Thanks, honey! Ooh!

35:05.154 --> 35:06.188
Jamie!

35:06.256 --> 35:07.623
Yo, you killed it, Ms. Scott!

35:07.690 --> 35:09.524
Yo, thanks, Chuck!

35:09.592 --> 35:11.226
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

35:11.293 --> 35:13.261
You wanted to get your
friends backstage passes.

35:13.329 --> 35:14.529
Remember, Jame?

35:14.597 --> 35:16.865
Oh, yeah.

35:16.932 --> 35:18.567
Dude, thanks for the hook-up.

35:18.635 --> 35:21.604
You were right, Jamie.
It's mad cool back here!

35:21.672 --> 35:23.139
Yeah, especially over there.

35:23.207 --> 35:25.575
Sweet! Free food!

35:27.277 --> 35:29.510
Sweet! Hot chicks!

35:29.577 --> 35:30.944
Let me show you the bus. It's out back.

35:35.047 --> 35:36.947
Thanks, dad. I'm glad to be home.

35:37.015 --> 35:38.948
All right, buddy.

35:39.016 --> 35:40.549
Ohh. Hey, you.

35:40.617 --> 35:41.817
Oh, it is good to be home!

35:41.885 --> 35:43.785
Oh, I can't wait to get in my own bed

35:43.853 --> 35:45.086
and sleep in tomorrow

35:45.154 --> 35:47.254
with the sweetest husband
in the whole world.

35:47.322 --> 35:48.322
Well, that sounds good,

35:48.389 --> 35:49.924
but you have an encore to do first.

35:49.992 --> 35:51.459
You better get out there.

35:51.527 --> 35:53.228
Okay. Okay.

35:53.295 --> 35:54.630
Have fun.

36:02.968 --> 36:06.403
Everybody else knows how this goes

36:06.471 --> 36:09.172
we'll be seeing you tomorrow... I hope.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.140
See you tomorrow.

36:12.910 --> 36:17.712
* Everybody's got my number now *

36:17.780 --> 36:22.114
* maybe I could find a way out *

36:22.181 --> 36:25.882
* I've been running
too long on this shift *

36:25.950 --> 36:29.949
* and I've been keeping
on tabs on myself *

36:30.017 --> 36:35.419
* and now I'm cutting
in close on my limit *

36:35.487 --> 36:36.754
Taylor.

36:36.821 --> 36:38.588
Don't just stand there
like we're not family,

36:43.292 --> 36:44.992
Surprised to see me, huh?

36:45.060 --> 36:47.494
Uh, yeah, Haley didn't
say you were coming.

36:47.561 --> 36:49.596
'Cause Hales didn't know.

36:49.664 --> 36:52.803
Yeah, she definitely would
have warned me about you.

36:52.870 --> 36:55.741
Why? Still dreaming
about me, there, Nate?

36:55.808 --> 36:58.444
They say you never forget your first.

36:58.512 --> 36:59.913
Taylor...

37:01.483 --> 37:03.484
So, is there room in
that big superstar house

37:03.551 --> 37:05.385
for me and my boy?

37:05.453 --> 37:07.287
Unless you can think of somebody else

37:07.355 --> 37:10.123
who wants to sneak into my room.

37:10.191 --> 37:11.157
No?

37:11.225 --> 37:12.626
Okay.

37:12.693 --> 37:15.361
See you there, Nate.

37:15.428 --> 37:18.629
* think you can find me *

37:18.696 --> 37:23.498
* 'cause everybody else
gave up a while ago *

37:23.566 --> 37:28.236
* I'm looking out, I'm
looking out at gray skies *

37:28.303 --> 37:33.875
* I'm looking out, I'm
looking out a hole *

37:33.943 --> 37:36.944
* you're never gonna be... *

37:38.581 --> 37:40.281
See, aren't you glad we already did

37:40.349 --> 37:42.516
the whole firs
t-date-kiss thing?

37:42.583 --> 37:44.818
'Cause now we don't have to be nervous.

37:44.886 --> 37:48.188
Yeah... I'm still kind of nervous.

37:48.256 --> 37:50.523
See, I have this question.

37:58.599 --> 37:59.799
"Will you be my girlfriend?

37:59.866 --> 38:02.134
Yes. No. Maybe."

38:02.201 --> 38:03.935
Let me think.

38:05.504 --> 38:07.674
Maybe.

38:17.319 --> 38:19.587
Yes.

38:19.655 --> 38:22.457
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:22.525 --> 38:24.359
You better.

38:38.374 --> 38:47.916
* You're never gonna see
until you see yourself *

38:47.984 --> 38:51.253
thanks for walking me to the door.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.188
Actually, I'm just staying down the hall

38:53.256 --> 38:54.923
till I find a place.

38:54.991 --> 38:56.558
So...

38:56.625 --> 38:57.725
Good night.

39:01.931 --> 39:03.164
Julian...

39:04.999 --> 39:07.334
how did we get the
funding for the movie?

39:07.401 --> 39:10.304
We found a small production company.

39:10.372 --> 39:11.972
Oh.

39:12.040 --> 39:14.207
It's just kind of
funny, don't you think?

39:14.275 --> 39:15.975
Right when I needed a break, it came.

39:17.877 --> 39:20.578
My father and I put up the money.

39:20.646 --> 39:22.146
Why would you do that?

39:22.214 --> 39:23.714
Because I believe in you.

39:26.486 --> 39:28.354
See you tomorrow.

39:28.422 --> 39:30.858
See you tomorrow.

39:36.565 --> 39:46.275
* You're never gonna be anybody else *

39:46.343 --> 39:55.082
* you're never gonna see
until you see yourself *

39:55.150 --> 39:58.321
* so, come on, come on *

39:58.388 --> 40:00.690
* see how it goes *

40:00.758 --> 40:05.161
* come on, come on, take a deep breath *

40:05.228 --> 40:08.097
* and don't let go *

40:18.442 --> 40:20.209
David.

40:20.277 --> 40:22.744
Quinn. Hey.

40:22.812 --> 40:26.548
Uh... hey, David.

40:26.616 --> 40:28.550
Well, come in! Please.

40:28.618 --> 40:30.185
Yes, of course. Come in.

40:30.253 --> 40:31.586
Hey. It's good to see you.

40:31.654 --> 40:33.054
Good to see you.

40:33.122 --> 40:34.955
Oh, hey, Tay.

40:35.023 --> 40:37.525
You remember David.
He's Quinny's ex-husband.

40:37.593 --> 40:39.894
Oh, "ex-husband" is so yesterday.

40:39.962 --> 40:42.296
I prefer to call him my new boyfriend.

40:46.701 --> 40:48.735
So, which room's ours?

40:55.041 --> 40:57.342
Hey.

41:18.129 --> 41:19.496
Hey, Brooke.

41:23.068 --> 41:25.602
Still want to have that dinner?

41:25.602 --> 41:33.671
