WEBVTT

00:08.300 --> 00:10.099
Uh, the patients are here
For the domino transplant.

00:10.100 --> 00:10.900
Right.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.500
I wanted to ask you,
If it's an appropriate time --

00:13.500 --> 00:15.500
I've been working
With mrs. Hoepfinger,

00:15.500 --> 00:17.700
And i was hoping
You'd allow me

00:17.800 --> 00:18.800
To be her lead surgeon
During the domino transplant.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.000
This isn't
An isolated procedure.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
I'm gonna be monitoring
All six surgeries

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
And performing one myself.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.300
Isn't your
First-quarter review

00:26.300 --> 00:28.200
Scheduled for later
This afternoon?

00:28.200 --> 00:29.500
Uh, yes,
As a matter of fact, it is.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.600
Good. We can discuss this
When we discuss your progress.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.700
Morning, ladies.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.200
The donors and the recipients
For the transplant are here.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.400
Oh, we're coming.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.800
Dinner tonight, mary?
I made reservations.

00:39.800 --> 00:40.700
Can't wait.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.100
You're having dinner
With dr. Grant?

00:47.100 --> 00:50.100
Yes. At christopher's,
Of all places. Excuse me.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.900
It's my 10-year anniversary
At st. Jude's,

00:52.900 --> 00:55.200
And he wants to celebrate.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.700
You didn't now?
No.

00:56.900 --> 00:59.700
It's a thing he does
For the nursing staff.

00:59.700 --> 01:00.800
It's kind of his way
Of apologizing

01:00.900 --> 01:02.700
For being an absolute ass
For 10 years.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.400
Oh, so i have to
Wait 10 years

01:04.500 --> 01:06.400
To get him to actually take me
Out to dinner.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.000
So, your wife's coming
In tonight?

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah, we hired a realtor, so
She'll start looking tomorrow.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.499
I'd be happy to take her
To lunch or around the city.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.700
Oh, yeah.
That sounds great.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.300
You know, i was beginning
To think you were making her up.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.200
I'm not...making her up.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.000
Well, like i said, i'd be happy
To take her to lunch.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.100
That's good.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.200
Morning, everybody.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.900
Morning.morning.
Morning.morning.

01:29.900 --> 01:31.200
Welcome to st. Jude's.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.500
First off, we all want to thank
The kidney donors

01:35.500 --> 01:39.200
For their amazing generosity
Of spirit and for their bravery.

01:43.500 --> 01:44.600
This is a great opportunity

01:44.600 --> 01:47.000
For us all to get to know
One another a little

01:47.000 --> 01:49.600
And for the families to,
Of course, finally meet.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.200
Would you introduce yourselves?

01:51.200 --> 01:53.900
Um, hello.
I'm henrietta lewis.

01:53.900 --> 01:55.000
And i'm hank.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.100
Hello.
Wen chan.

01:57.100 --> 01:58.400
My name is hui chan.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.700
I'm wanda hoepfinger,
And this is my husband, richard.

02:01.700 --> 02:03.500
We've found it useful for both
The donors and the recipients,

02:03.500 --> 02:07.600
As well as the medical staff,
To pair off the couples

02:07.600 --> 02:08.600
As they will be in surgery,
So...

02:08.600 --> 02:11.300
Mr. Hoepfinger, will you please
Sit with mr. Chan?

02:15.600 --> 02:18.700
Mr. Hoepfinger is donating
To mr. Chan.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.600
It's like
A bad '70s key party.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.800
What's a key party?

02:22.800 --> 02:23.999
I'll tell you later.
Okay.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.100
Mrs. Chan, will you please sit
With mrs. Lewis?

02:29.100 --> 02:32.000
Mrs. Chan is donating
To mrs. Lewis.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.600
Finally, mr. Lewis,
Sit with mrs. Hoepfinger.

02:44.500 --> 02:47.800
Mr. Lewis is giving his
To mrs. Hoepfinger.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.600
Sorry.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.700
If you'd all turn your attention

02:59.700 --> 03:02.799
To the powerpoint diagram
On the screen,

03:02.800 --> 03:06.400
We can discuss the workings
Of tomorrow's procedure.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.199
Dr. Grant?
Thank you.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.400
Okay, let's get started.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.200
This is a highly complicated
Procedure.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.500
It demands extraordinary
Attention

03:13.500 --> 03:15.800
To every distinct detail.

Recipient table two,
Mr. Chan.

03:25.900 --> 03:28.300
Recipient table three,
Mrs. Lewis.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.300
Okay, and you'll have
Recovered kidneys

03:30.300 --> 03:34.300
From mr. Lewis, mr. Hoepfinger,
And mrs. Chan.

03:34.300 --> 03:36.700
You're putting the whole week's
Pancreas schedule

03:36.700 --> 03:37.500
In the crapper.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.100
We're changing the world one day
At a time, dr. Lyons.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.399
There will be six surgical teams
Working simultaneously --

03:43.400 --> 03:45.500
One per recovery,
One per recipient.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.200
We'll be placing all three
Donors under anesthesia

03:46.200 --> 03:49.600
At the exact same time,

03:49.600 --> 03:52.400
Making sure that each recovery
Is carefully monitored.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.000
Our donors will begin sedation
At 10:26.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.800
They will all be given 10 mg
Of propofol.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.200
Except mr. Lewis.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.200
He'll be given 20 mg
Due to his larger size.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.900
And who's getting
His kidney?

04:02.900 --> 04:05.000
My mrs. Hoepfinger.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.500
<i>[ chuckles ]
Your mrs. Hoepfinger?</i>

04:06.500 --> 04:07.399
We've gotten very close.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.400
Ohh, so, vancouver,
You like them big, huh?

04:10.400 --> 04:11.800
More to love.

04:11.800 --> 04:12.700
Moving along.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.399
So, once the donors
Are all sedated,

04:16.399 --> 04:17.700
We will begin the...

04:17.700 --> 04:19.800
How are you?
No different
Than last night.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.100
Last night
You were pretty good.

04:21.100 --> 04:21.700
I was real good.

04:21.700 --> 04:24.500
...barring any complications
With anesthesiology.

04:24.500 --> 04:28.000
Barring any complications,
The incisions are made at 10:47.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.000
Left port for the camera,
Right for operating.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.100
The extraction incisions
Are umbilical.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.500
Except for mrs. Hoepfinger,

04:33.500 --> 04:35.700
Who will have
A super-pubic incision.

04:35.700 --> 04:38.100
On the remote chance that she
Will ever wear a bikini.

04:38.700 --> 04:41.000
You want to be her lead surgeon,
And this is the way you act?

04:41.600 --> 04:42.300
Sorry.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.699
He's just blowing off
Some steam.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.000
It's fine to do that
In here,

04:45.000 --> 04:46.999
But when you laugh
In front of the patients,

04:47.000 --> 04:49.300
You destroy the entire fabric
Of their trust.

04:49.300 --> 04:50.400
I know.
Do you?

04:50.400 --> 04:52.200
Dr. Grant, again,
I'm sorry.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:01.400 --> 05:04.100
Mrs. Hoepfinger in a bikini
Is kind of funny.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.299
That's my girlfriend
You're talking about there.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.800
How does mr. Hoepfinger feel
About your relationship?

05:08.800 --> 05:11.100
Well, i'm sure
He likes vancouver more

05:11.200 --> 05:16.400
Than he likes the 6'5" black man
Who is giving his wife...a kidney.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.000
Excuse me.

05:21.900 --> 05:22.899
Hey, baby.

05:22.900 --> 05:25.300
I thought you were gonna be here
A little bit later.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.600
My plane got in early,
So...

05:27.600 --> 05:30.100
Oh, okay.

05:31.900 --> 05:34.500
Hi. Simon griffith,
First-year fellow.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.400
You can call him
Vancouver.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.300
Oh, is that a nickname?
Not really.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.300
But you prefer it?

05:40.300 --> 05:41.100
Mmm, not really.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.200
You want to take
A look around?

05:44.200 --> 05:45.100
Hi.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.500
Hello.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.300
Oh, i'm sorry.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.600
Kate armstrong,
This is my wife, terea.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.000
Kate.
I've heard a lot about you.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.399
Oh, i've heard a lot
About you.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.200
It's so nice
To finally meet you.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.300
It is.

06:05.300 --> 06:08.400
So, what neighborhoods
Are you looking in?

06:08.400 --> 06:09.500
Excuse me?

06:09.500 --> 06:12.400
For houses.
Where are you looking?

06:12.600 --> 06:15.400
Oh, i'm just gonna
Drive around today

06:15.400 --> 06:16.700
And see what i see.

06:16.900 --> 06:18.000
Oh, great.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.399
Well, how about that tour?
You want to...

06:20.400 --> 06:21.400
Okay.
All right, excuse us.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.200
I knew we'd never make it
To ireland.

06:30.200 --> 06:34.799
I knew it, but i couldn't
Tell him to stop hoping.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.300
We stopped in new york
To see my brother,

06:39.100 --> 06:42.200
And he couldn't catch
His breath.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.300
Why didn't you call me?

06:44.300 --> 06:47.100
He didn't want me to.

06:47.100 --> 06:50.700
But he knows
He can't do much more now.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.700
You think
He'll let me operate?

06:58.200 --> 07:00.600
I don't know.
He keeps changing his mind.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.000
But i thought
It would be best

07:03.000 --> 07:03.700
If you would talk to him
About that.

07:08.100 --> 07:08.800
Okay.

07:19.200 --> 07:19.900
Hey.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.000
You look like hell.

07:25.700 --> 07:27.400
You should talk.

07:30.300 --> 07:31.400
Let me help you
Catch your breath.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.100
Yep.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.600
All right.
Deep breath, inhale.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.900
All right. Exhale.
All the way out.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.300
Again.
Breathe in as deep as you can.

07:44.000 --> 07:44.700
All right, exhale.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.100
Let it out.
Let it out.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.300
Any better?

07:55.500 --> 07:58.500
Didn't know
I'd be this afraid.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.400
What can i do?

08:17.500 --> 08:19.200
Didn't know
It'd be like this.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.900
I could admit you today.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.700
It's not too late
To put you on the list.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.000
I don't know what to do.

08:35.299 --> 08:36.100
Don't know.

08:41.600 --> 08:42.900
Why don't you let me
Help you, bart?

08:46.200 --> 08:47.400
I don't know.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.099
Okay, so this is how
The room aignment's gonna go.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.400
Mrs. Chan is gonna be
In room one...

09:08.400 --> 09:10.100
There's only one bed
In this room.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.400
We're bringing
Another one in.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.300
Because we were told
That there would be two beds,

09:13.300 --> 09:15.400
That we would recover
In the same room.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.600
There will be.
Two beds.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.400
Mr. Hoepfinger, you and
Your wife will be in room two.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.500
My wife said i was staying
In the holiday inn.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.500
Yes,
After you've recovered.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.300
You'll be here
For the first three days.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.700
Excuse me.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.900
I don't feel very good.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.100
We'll take your temperature
In a minute.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.200
We need to go get some more
Blood work done now at the lab.

09:54.300 --> 09:55.900
Are they all
That bizarre before?

09:55.900 --> 10:00.700
Some. Some are really calm,
Like unnaturally calm.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.500
I couldn't do
What you do.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.400
I prefer my patients
Unconscious.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.500
You know what, though?
I think that...

10:08.700 --> 10:09.600
I don't know.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.400
I think
It's kind of romantic.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.700
A kidney transplant?

10:12.700 --> 10:15.500
The way it works.
The domino effect.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.500
I mean, a person
Volunteers their kidney

10:18.500 --> 10:20.500
To somebody that they love
Because they need it,

10:20.500 --> 10:23.100
And then if they find out
That they don't match,

10:23.100 --> 10:25.000
Instead of just giving up,

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
That person offers their kidney
To the entire world.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.200
And then they wait.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
And then this happens.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.100
I mean, when somebody does that,
This is what happens.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.600
Chans or hoepfingers?

10:38.600 --> 10:41.400
Lewises.
Hoepfingers are next door.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.000
So, uh, 10 years
At st. Jude, huh?

10:44.800 --> 10:46.200
I know.
I'm ancient.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.200
Nah, you're younger
Than i am.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.500
How old are you, anyway?

10:49.500 --> 10:51.999
31.
How old are you?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.700
I am so not telling you.

10:53.700 --> 10:54.700
Hi, simon.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.100
I didn't say hello?

11:00.700 --> 11:04.100
I'm gonna go get ready
For my very important dinner.

11:07.700 --> 11:11.500
Dr. Grant's taking her out
For her 10th anniversary here.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.400
She doesn't want to go.
Oh.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.600
So, 31, huh?

11:23.800 --> 11:24.900
Yeah.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.400
Better start getting that
Retirement portfolio together.

11:27.400 --> 11:30.300
Yeah, i have a 401(k),
Some investments.

11:30.300 --> 11:31.199
I was pretty smart
After college.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.400
Simon,
I was just kidding.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.100
Oh.

11:36.100 --> 11:38.200
You know, um,

11:39.000 --> 11:40.700
Whenever there's a bunch
Of people in the room,

11:40.800 --> 11:42.600
You always have
Something funny to say,

11:42.700 --> 11:45.200
But when it's just me and you...

11:45.200 --> 11:46.400
I guess --
When it's just both of us --

11:46.400 --> 11:47.200
Yeah.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.000
Oh.

12:00.600 --> 12:04.200
Simon, um...
What are you thinking?

12:04.500 --> 12:05.300
That i like you.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.200
I-i kind of thought
You liked me, too.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.400
But, i --
Um, we work together.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.400
I enjoy your company,
But...

12:14.700 --> 12:16.300
But what?

12:16.300 --> 12:18.200
But i'm not available.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.300
Please don't tell dr. Grant.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.500
Oh, god, i hate this.

12:25.500 --> 12:26.400
What?

12:26.400 --> 12:29.700
I hate being the nurse
That's screwing the boss.

12:29.700 --> 12:30.900
It makes everybody
Look at me

12:31.000 --> 12:32.700
Like i'm either desperate
Or dangerous.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.000
Well, so, leave him.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I fell in love
With him.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.400
All right?

12:37.400 --> 12:39.600
I mean, i'm not the kind
Of person that just does this.

12:39.600 --> 12:40.900
Do you think
That he loves you, too?

12:43.700 --> 12:44.600
I don't know.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.900
But i know this isn't
Gonna happen...between us.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.200
I do know that.

13:02.900 --> 13:03.900
Ms. Armstrong?

13:04.000 --> 13:04.700
Hey, mrs. Chan.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.299
I heard mr. Lewis was running
A temperature.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.399
Oh, it's very low.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.800
But even less than one degree
Above normal, isn't --

13:11.800 --> 13:14.800
Mrs. Chan, this isn't something
You need to worry about.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.600
But the risk
To the recipient --

13:16.600 --> 13:19.700
Only exists if the elevated
Temperature in the donor

13:19.700 --> 13:20.699
Is due to an infection.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.000
But i read --

13:22.000 --> 13:23.999
Mrs. Chan, we've got everything
Under control.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.900
I think you should go to
Your room and relax.

13:25.900 --> 13:26.900
Got a big day tomorrow.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.300
Everything okay?

13:32.300 --> 13:35.400
Mrs. Chan is worried
About mr. Lewis' temp.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.900
Ah, and you're worried
About mrs. Chan?

13:36.900 --> 13:38.900
I am, a little.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.400
Have you heard from bart?
Yes.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.800
Is he having a good time?
I didn't ask.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.700
You know, it's hoepfinger
We should be concerned about.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.700
Hoepfinger's fine.
He's just nervous.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.100
Mrs. Chan is on the verge.

13:48.100 --> 13:49.200
Hey.
Hey.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.800
Dr. Grant? Hi.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.400
Uh...would you be offended
If we didn't go out tonight?

13:54.800 --> 13:56.500
No, not at all.
You don't want to go out?

13:56.500 --> 13:59.599
I do, i just --
I don't feel up to it.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.500
Are you sick?
No.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.900
Look, i just don't feel
Like celebrating, okay?

14:03.900 --> 14:05.200
Okay. We won't go then.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.200
Really?
Mm-hmm.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.200
Okay, bye.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.700
Hi, dr. Grant.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.600
Hi...you.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.300
I came here
To look at houses.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.400
I got on the plane...

14:19.400 --> 14:21.500
And then somewhere over kansas,
I just realized that this --

14:21.500 --> 14:24.600
You know, it's just
A little different out here.

14:25.300 --> 14:26.700
Why did you take the job?

14:26.700 --> 14:28.200
How could i not?

14:28.200 --> 14:30.300
Head surgeon, the salary,
It allows us to do so --

14:30.300 --> 14:32.000
"us"?

14:32.900 --> 14:34.400
You did this for us?

14:38.200 --> 14:40.400
Of course. Of course.

14:41.700 --> 14:42.900
Tom, tell the truth.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.400
Truth is, terea...

14:52.800 --> 14:53.600
I don't know.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.200
I think you do.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.800
I think you knew the minute
You took the job here.

15:08.100 --> 15:09.400
I knew, too.

15:09.900 --> 15:12.500
I didn't stop you,
And, uh, i knew, too.

15:17.800 --> 15:18.900
Okay.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.300
Hi.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.100
Hey. Hey, hey.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.700
Kate,
This is my wife, terea.

15:28.800 --> 15:33.300
Terea, yeah, i know.
We've already done this part.

15:33.900 --> 15:36.400
Well,
I should actually be...

15:37.400 --> 15:39.200
It was nice
To meet you again.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.100
You, too.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.600
Okay.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.100
Is this an okay time?

16:08.700 --> 16:10.500
My quarterly review is scheduled
For now.

16:10.500 --> 16:11.700
Come on in.

16:12.900 --> 16:15.500
First off,
I want to apologize

16:15.600 --> 16:18.500
For being inappropriate
Today.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.200
Sit down.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.499
So, how am i doing?

16:28.500 --> 16:31.900
I can see you're beginning to be
Very comfortable around here.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.200
Yeah, i'm getting
Used to it. Yeah.

16:36.300 --> 16:39.700
Your people skills could use
Some work.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.900
Okay.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.700
I like your confidence,

16:43.700 --> 16:47.000
Though i worry that you may
Overreafrom time to time.

16:48.200 --> 16:48.999
Okay.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.500
I'm not saying that you're not
A very talented surgeon.

16:52.300 --> 16:55.900
You're just in a bit of a rush
To become a great one.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.100
Okay.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.500
What was it like
When you were a fellow?

17:09.800 --> 17:11.400
Difficult.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.299
Dr. Jacobs --

17:12.300 --> 17:14.300
Was an incredibly demanding
Chief of staff,

17:14.300 --> 17:15.699
And he put me through
Absolute hell.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.700
Yeah,
But you were working

17:17.800 --> 17:20.900
For the greatest
Transplant surgeon in the world.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.800
That's why i'm here. I mean,
That's why we're all here.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.699
For dr. Jacobs?
For all of it.

17:25.700 --> 17:28.900
Dr. Jacobs, you -- st. Jude's
Is the world's finest,

17:28.900 --> 17:30.300
And i'm just trying
To live up to that.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.600
Now, i've already been working
With the hoepfingers.

17:32.600 --> 17:33.900
Let me be your lead surgeon.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.500
Vancouver, i --
What else are you gonna do?

17:35.500 --> 17:37.700
Get one of the gut guys
From general surgery?

17:37.700 --> 17:40.600
I may be a fellow, but i'm a lot
Better than they are.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.200
Thanks for coming in
For your review.

17:43.700 --> 17:44.900
Keep up the good work.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.500
Hey. So, we're all set
For tomorrow.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.300
Great.
You okay?

18:13.300 --> 18:16.500
Why?
You look a little upset.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.400
You know what? I'm great.
And you know why i'm great?

18:18.400 --> 18:18.899
Why?

18:18.900 --> 18:20.800
Because i am totally
Getting into

18:20.800 --> 18:23.000
This whole national
"mary's 10th-year" holiday.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.999
Oh, i see.
Mary-palooza.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.100
A very mary 10-year.

18:26.100 --> 18:26.900
Shut up.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.100
Do you -- do you want to go
Get a drink?

18:29.100 --> 18:30.300
What about your date
With the chief?

18:30.600 --> 18:31.900
You don't have to
If you don't want to.

18:31.900 --> 18:34.100
You know what?
A drink sounds about perfect.

18:34.100 --> 18:34.900
Good.

18:37.300 --> 18:38.900
What are you doing?

18:39.100 --> 18:39.900
Working.

18:40.300 --> 18:41.500
Shouldn't you
Be getting ready

18:41.600 --> 18:42.900
If you're gonna make
Your dinner?

18:44.200 --> 18:46.900
Mary canceled, so...

18:47.200 --> 18:48.900
Oh.

18:48.900 --> 18:51.000
How was
Simon's review today?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.600
He's your average fellow.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.000
Right.
Don't you think?

18:57.100 --> 19:00.100
You still have
That reservation, right?

19:00.100 --> 19:02.000
No, actually, i canceled.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.600
Oh, right.

19:09.600 --> 19:10.300
Well.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.600
You could make an effort
Every once in a while

19:15.600 --> 19:18.699
Instead of sitting
In your office every night

19:18.700 --> 19:20.400
Waiting for me
To come to you.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.200
It makes me feel like
You don't really care, you know?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.300
Nathaniel.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.500
Never mind.

19:49.700 --> 19:50.900
Simon: i made a mistake coming
To st. Jude's.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.600
You know, people told me
That he was impossible.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.600
I should've listened.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.199
Mary: he's a great surgeon,
Simon.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.700
Yes, he's a great surgeon.
Mm-hmm.

19:57.700 --> 20:01.200
He just doesn't want anybody
Else to be a great surgeon.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.000
Thank you.

20:04.900 --> 20:08.500
I thought that canadians
Only drank beer.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.900
You are forgetting
Canadian whiskey.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.800
Excuse me, and whiskey.

20:13.800 --> 20:19.100
And this very special
Canadian tequila.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.800
Happy 10 years, mary.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.200
Oh, my god.

20:30.300 --> 20:31.700
Can i tell you
Something stupid?

20:33.700 --> 20:35.500
Sure.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.200
I kissed jessica.

20:39.800 --> 20:40.800
Oh.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.900
Today.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.500
Oh.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.100
In one
Of the recovery rooms.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.000
On the day
That you're asking the boss

20:51.000 --> 20:54.300
To take over
One of the domino recipients.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.000
Yes, i said
It was something stupid.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Yeah.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.400
What --
What did she do?

21:02.400 --> 21:06.900
Basically, she told me
That i was out of my league.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.500
Is that what you think?

21:13.400 --> 21:17.200
I think i'm gonna have another
One of these canadian tequilas.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.100
You?

21:21.200 --> 21:23.600
Yeah. Yeah.

21:27.800 --> 21:31.000
Okay, looks good to me.
Thank you.

21:31.700 --> 21:32.500
Hey.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.000
I thought you'd be
House-hunting.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.500
Oh, well, i, uh,
Have a big procedure tomorrow,

21:38.500 --> 21:39.900
Got a lot of paperwork,
So...

21:39.900 --> 21:41.800
What are you still
Doing here?

21:41.800 --> 21:43.100
Donor hand-holding.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.200
Ah, domino donors.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.100
Yeah.

21:47.100 --> 21:48.300
Hoepfingers?

21:48.700 --> 21:49.500
Nope.
Oh.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.500
What?

21:57.500 --> 22:00.000
Are you ever going to give me
Your wife's phone number?

22:02.800 --> 22:04.900
My wife wants to leave me.

22:08.100 --> 22:09.100
Oh, i'm sorry.

22:09.100 --> 22:12.200
I just -- i don't --
I don't know what to do.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.400
Do you want her to leave?

22:16.800 --> 22:20.200
Sometimes, yes,
And then there's other times

22:20.200 --> 22:23.700
When, you know,
There's kids and houses and...

22:26.000 --> 22:27.800
We've built a life together,
So it's...

22:31.700 --> 22:33.500
It is the hardest thing.

22:36.700 --> 22:39.100
And i wish i could tell you
It was easier.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.100
Yeah.

22:43.800 --> 22:44.800
How are you doing?

22:48.600 --> 22:50.100
At first,

22:50.100 --> 22:55.100
I couldn't imagine a life
Without nathaniel.

22:56.800 --> 23:00.900
But now that
I'm on the other side,

23:01.900 --> 23:02.900
I'm better.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.200
Getting better.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.200
Good night,
Kate armstrong.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.100
Good night.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.000
Hey.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.200
Uh, can i sit down?

23:36.200 --> 23:37.400
It's the meeting room.

23:39.200 --> 23:42.000
Listen, last night,
When you kissed me --

23:42.000 --> 23:42.700
I was out of line.

23:42.700 --> 23:45.300
What you said was true.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.900
And the talking
And the flirting...

23:50.000 --> 23:51.600
I did want you to.

23:51.600 --> 23:54.000
I...just...needed you
To do that

23:54.000 --> 23:56.600
'Cause i never would have,
And then you did, and...

23:56.700 --> 23:59.900
I want you to know --

23:59.900 --> 24:02.000
I slept with mary
Last night.

24:03.300 --> 24:05.200
Wow.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.300
Yeah.

24:07.300 --> 24:08.400
Wow.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.100
Big day.

24:14.900 --> 24:15.700
Morning.

24:17.600 --> 24:18.800
Hi, dr. Grant.

24:18.800 --> 24:22.100
Hi.
The procedure's off.

24:22.600 --> 24:24.800
What? Why?

24:24.800 --> 24:28.000
One of our donors walked out
In the middle of the night.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.300
Who was it?
Kate: mrs. Chan.

24:30.300 --> 24:31.400
Well, did you try
To talk to her?

24:31.400 --> 24:33.600
We don't know
Where she is.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.100
Simon: uh, can't we call
The police?

24:35.100 --> 24:38.000
She's not a car, simon.
It's not like she's got lojack.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.400
Still,
If we can find her --
She's out.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.000
We've contacted unos and
Accessed st. Jude's database,

24:44.000 --> 24:45.500
But so far,
Nothing's come back.

24:52.800 --> 24:55.900
Excuse me?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
I'll do it.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.100
I'll be the donor
For the domino transplant.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.900
If i'm a match,
I want to do it.

25:09.400 --> 25:12.200
You have your anesthesiogy
And cardio evals,

25:12.200 --> 25:14.900
Tissue types, ct scan,
And you --

25:15.900 --> 25:17.200
When did you do
All of this?

25:17.200 --> 25:19.000
I've been thinking about it
For over a year.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.500
I just kind of took care
Of all the pieces.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.600
Did you know about it?

25:24.600 --> 25:26.900
We'd discussed it,
Yeah.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.700
And you're comfortable
With signing off?

25:28.700 --> 25:32.000
I am. I believe mary's doing
This for the right reasons.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.400
Is she a match for chan?

25:33.400 --> 25:35.300
No, but we're crossmatching
With a few others.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.500
How many?
Don't know yet.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.600
Could be more than five.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.900
I see.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.800
Kate, would you excuse us
For a minute?

25:43.800 --> 25:46.100
Of course.
See you.

25:47.700 --> 25:48.400
You're against this.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.000
I didn't say that.
Then you think i'm nuts.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.900
I think you might be
Caught up in the moment.

25:51.900 --> 25:54.400
So what if i am caught up
In the moment?

25:54.700 --> 25:56.900
What difference
Does that make?

25:57.000 --> 25:58.500
I'm trying
To give you an out.

25:58.500 --> 26:02.400
I don't want an out.
I...

26:02.400 --> 26:04.900
Dr. Grant, i've always been
Moved by the donors.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.100
I believe
In what they do.

26:07.100 --> 26:09.000
I promised myself
That if i ever had the chance,

26:09.100 --> 26:11.000
I would do my part.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.300
Mary, i need you here.

26:12.300 --> 26:13.500
Pam can cover for me.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.300
I'll be back full time
In two weeks.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.400
You okay?

26:22.400 --> 26:23.300
Why?

26:23.300 --> 26:24.400
It's just a kidney,
Right?

26:24.400 --> 26:25.900
It's not like i'm gonna die
Or anything.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.500
No, of course not.

26:28.500 --> 26:29.300
Okay.

26:35.900 --> 26:37.100
Hey.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.200
You sure you're okay?

26:44.300 --> 26:46.600
Bart:
Remember that congressman?

26:47.300 --> 26:48.900
What was his name?

26:49.000 --> 26:51.400
John evers.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.700
John evers, right.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.900
Altoona.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.600
Remember what happened
To him?

27:01.200 --> 27:03.900
He had i.p.f. Just like you,
We transplanted him.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.200
The disease came back.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.500
He lived
For six more months.

27:08.900 --> 27:10.400
Nate...

27:11.300 --> 27:13.400
I've made my choice.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.800
You said,
Just yesterday --

27:15.800 --> 27:17.400
Yesterday, i was...

27:19.100 --> 27:20.500
Terrified.

27:21.100 --> 27:22.800
And today?

27:22.800 --> 27:24.600
Just scared.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Bart, we can --

27:28.000 --> 27:29.400
Do you remember

27:29.400 --> 27:33.000
We told him he should see as
Much of his family as possible?

27:35.200 --> 27:38.500
I was with him
The morning he went --

27:39.200 --> 27:44.100
Wife was right
At his bedside, kids.

27:44.100 --> 27:45.300
I remember.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.000
He was home, nate.

27:52.800 --> 27:53.800
Home.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.700
I want you to set up
My hospice here.

28:02.700 --> 28:03.100
Look --
No.

28:03.900 --> 28:06.400
I want you to set it up.

28:08.200 --> 28:11.000
Janet shouldn't have to be
Dealing with this stuff.

28:12.100 --> 28:15.100
I want you to do
This last thing,

28:15.100 --> 28:17.100
And i want you to see it
Through for me.

28:21.200 --> 28:21.900
Okay?

28:29.900 --> 28:35.200
I'd like to introduce everyone
To the pavels,

28:35.200 --> 28:36.300
The noahs.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.200
The farbockers,

28:39.300 --> 28:43.500
And say welcome back
To the hoepfingers, the lewises,

28:43.500 --> 28:47.200
Mr. Chan, and, of course,
You all know mary.

28:53.500 --> 28:55.000
This is gonna be
A new record.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.800
I know. Hopkins did five.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.000
That's very exciting.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.200
So, here we are again.

29:01.500 --> 29:04.000
I've made up a new list
Of surgical teams.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.900
Most of us are
On the same patients,

29:05.900 --> 29:09.300
But the big change is that
Dr. Griffith will be taking lead

29:09.300 --> 29:11.100
On mrs. Hoepfinger.

29:11.600 --> 29:14.600
Dr. Griffith, you'll use sue
And tony for anesthesiology.

29:15.300 --> 29:16.200
Okay.

29:18.200 --> 29:19.999
And, uh, take jessica
As your scrub nurse.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.300
I'm sure she'd like that.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.600
Okay, then.

29:26.600 --> 29:27.500
Tomorrow morning, first thing,

29:27.500 --> 29:31.000
We'll begin the sedation of
All six donors at the same time.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.400
Once they're sedated,

29:32.400 --> 29:36.000
The recovery teams will move
Into the o.r.s one through six.

29:48.200 --> 29:48.900
How we doing?

29:51.400 --> 29:53.700
Ah. Not exactly the week
I was expecting to me having.

29:53.700 --> 29:56.900
Yeah, i know.
New world record.

29:57.100 --> 29:59.600
I wasn't talking
About the surgeries, simon.

30:02.400 --> 30:05.000
I hope this doesn't have
Anything to do with last night.

30:05.000 --> 30:05.700
What?

30:05.700 --> 30:06.399
This.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.600
Oh, god, no.
Good.

30:08.700 --> 30:10.500
Why would you think that?
I didn't. I just --

30:10.500 --> 30:14.000
One thing has nothing to do
With the other, really. Really.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.800
Okay.
Okay.

30:16.800 --> 30:21.200
How do you feel...
About last night?

30:21.900 --> 30:23.200
I feel that it's...

30:23.400 --> 30:30.300
...awesome, what you're doing
For these people.

30:33.100 --> 30:34.800
Oh.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.800
Six-way domino transplant,
I mean,

30:35.800 --> 30:37.100
It's the first
In the world.

30:37.400 --> 30:41.000
And now you're one
Of the lead surgeons.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.600
Yeah.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.200
Well, um...

30:46.500 --> 30:48.200
You get some rest.

30:48.300 --> 30:50.500
I'll come check back
In a while.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.000
Okay.
Okay.

30:56.500 --> 30:57.200
Jessica: hey.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.300
Don't blow her off
Like that.

30:59.300 --> 31:00.399
Like what?

31:00.400 --> 31:02.500
Just now. She was hoping
You actually gave a crap.

31:02.500 --> 31:03.099
I do.

31:03.100 --> 31:05.400
Well, then stop acting like
A typical surgeon.

31:05.400 --> 31:08.300
Okay, you're the one that said
Nothing was gonna happen.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.200
You said
You weren't interested.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.200
You could've given me a day
To think about it.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.500
Now you've made things
Complicated.

31:12.500 --> 31:13.999
What, by sleeping
With the chief of staff?

31:14.000 --> 31:15.700
Screw you.
I'm just saying,

31:15.700 --> 31:18.000
I don't blame you for that,
So don't blame me for mary.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.300
How you doing?

31:37.700 --> 31:39.600
Janet's a little upset.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.500
Yeah.

31:42.500 --> 31:46.600
Not exactly happy
With the new decor.

31:48.900 --> 31:50.300
Right.

31:51.500 --> 31:54.700
So, i've, uh...

31:54.700 --> 31:56.600
I signed all the...

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
The forms,

31:59.200 --> 32:03.700
The "do not resuscitate"
And hospice stuff.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.300
Okay.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.300
Now, listen.

32:14.700 --> 32:20.200
Make sure these folks don't do
Anything stupid.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.900
My heart stops,

32:24.100 --> 32:29.100
You make sure they don't put me
On one of those...

32:29.600 --> 32:31.100
Damn ventilators.

32:35.100 --> 32:36.400
Counting on you, nate.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.700
Make sure nobody...

32:42.600 --> 32:44.400
Does something heroic.

33:00.700 --> 33:02.700
So, the camera is gonna go
Into the --

33:02.700 --> 33:04.200
Abdominal port.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.400
Right, and then the lower
And the upper renal pulse --

33:06.400 --> 33:08.200
Will be retracted.

33:08.200 --> 33:09.500
You're a little high.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.000
Yeah.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.600
They gave me the valium already.

33:12.700 --> 33:14.700
I'm just kind of waiting
For the big stuff now.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.600
So, my renal artery,
It gets dissected.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.800
I don't really want to talk
About this. Do you?

33:20.570 --> 33:23.800
No, you're right.

33:24.770 --> 33:28.100
Hey, are we okay?

33:28.500 --> 33:30.000
It just...
It's been a little funny.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.100
How?

33:32.270 --> 33:33.600
I know you kind of like simon.

33:33.600 --> 33:34.700
No.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.100
And i know that simon
Kind of likes you.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.700
What did he say to you?

33:39.340 --> 33:41.000
He told me
That he kissed you,

33:41.390 --> 33:43.100
And that you said
That you didn't like him,

33:43.230 --> 33:48.200
But you do like him,
Don't you?

33:49.220 --> 33:52.100
No. I don't.

33:57.580 --> 34:00.500
It's been a long time
Since i've scrubbed in.

34:03.540 --> 34:04.800
Are you okay?

34:05.510 --> 34:06.500
Yeah, why?

34:06.600 --> 34:08.600
You're not talking
To anyone.

34:08.600 --> 34:11.100
No, i'm fine.

34:11.100 --> 34:12.600
Did you see bart?

34:12.699 --> 34:14.800
It's not bart.
I'm just concentrating.

34:14.900 --> 34:18.300
We're doing six surgeries
At the same time.

34:40.699 --> 34:42.900
Simon: standing by.

34:42.900 --> 34:45.300
Suction.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.000
You're giving her
Too much fluid.

34:47.100 --> 34:48.600
Man: make sure
The level stays steady.

34:48.600 --> 34:51.000
She's all right.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.900
You can't give her
That much fluid.

34:53.570 --> 34:54.900
It's fine.

34:56.239 --> 34:57.300
Vancouver,
Listen to jessica.

34:58.190 --> 34:58.800
Excuse me?

34:58.800 --> 35:01.000
She's been in a hundred
Of these. You've been in two.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.600
Listen to what
She's telling you.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.300
Dr. Grant,
This is my patient.

35:04.300 --> 35:06.900
A 6-0 proline on a needle
Holder, please.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
6-0 proline
On a needle holder.

35:10.580 --> 35:11.500
You're going to overload her

35:11.600 --> 35:12.900
And run the risk
Of congestive heart failure.

35:12.900 --> 35:15.900
It's at
The appropriate level.

35:16.000 --> 35:16.600
Step out.

35:17.180 --> 35:17.900
What?
Step out.

35:18.710 --> 35:19.600
Step out!

35:23.720 --> 35:25.230
All right,
Get her fluid levels down.

35:25.380 --> 35:27.520
Let's get her back
Under control.

35:29.400 --> 35:30.500
Gauze, please.

35:42.300 --> 35:44.100
Hey.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.100
Yeah.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.400
He's been in a mood.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.900
You know,
I didn't do anything wrong,

35:49.900 --> 35:51.800
And i didn't do anything
To deserve that.

35:52.670 --> 35:53.700
Well,
It's just one procedure.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.100
It's a new world record.

35:55.100 --> 35:56.800
There will be plenty more,
Trust me.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.100
There will be
Plenty more.

35:58.230 --> 36:00.600
A new world record.

36:00.600 --> 36:03.900
Hastings is splitting the bill
For a party on the floor.

36:03.900 --> 36:06.500
There will be beer, wine,
And wings.

36:06.500 --> 36:09.200
Hastings says
It's required.

36:09.200 --> 36:12.700
Ah. Come on.
I'll buy you about 12 beers.

36:12.700 --> 36:14.000
Come on.

36:14.730 --> 36:16.700
It's required.

36:22.160 --> 36:23.900
Booyah.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.200
All right, cheers.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.600
Kate: here's to great work
In there.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.700
To world records.

36:43.700 --> 36:46.420
Vancouver, come here.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.900
It's history, nonetheless,
And you were part of it.

36:58.490 --> 36:59.600
When i was a fellow,

36:59.600 --> 37:01.500
The crap that bart
Put me through was --

37:01.500 --> 37:03.200
I appreciate you
Passing that on to me.

37:04.190 --> 37:05.700
You're angry
With me, huh?

37:05.800 --> 37:07.600
Mrs. Hoepfinger's heart rate
Was elevated.

37:07.600 --> 37:08.870
You could've put her
At risk.

37:09.010 --> 37:11.100
I've performed dozens
Of abdominal procedures.

37:11.100 --> 37:12.400
I know how to maintain
The fluid levels.

37:12.400 --> 37:13.730
Jessica was correct
In pointing out --

37:13.730 --> 37:16.000
You allowed the word of a scrub
Nurse to override my orders.

37:17.100 --> 37:19.600
Ifthat the opinion of a -- ...is better than mine
--scrub nurse?

37:19.600 --> 37:21.100
I'd be careful with that,
Vancouver.

37:21.100 --> 37:22.410
I just want to know
Where i stand.

37:22.530 --> 37:27.550
That nurse knows more about
Transplant surgery than you do.

37:27.990 --> 37:30.730
You know what?
Shove it up your ass.

37:32.310 --> 37:33.530
Is this your way
Of quitting?

37:33.690 --> 37:35.650
Why do you call me vancouver?
Why do you think?

37:35.800 --> 37:38.500
It's no different than when you
Call a terminal patient mister.

37:38.500 --> 37:39.900
So when you kill
My career,

37:39.900 --> 37:42.000
You won't have to feel bad
About the way you treated me.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.600
You won't have to look at me
Like i'm a human being.

37:52.950 --> 37:54.650
That wasn't fair of us.

37:55.810 --> 37:56.660
What?

37:56.810 --> 37:59.600
Today, in the operating room.
We both picked on him.

37:59.750 --> 38:03.750
He was giving her too much --
You assigned me to him because
You sense something, right?

38:07.320 --> 38:08.620
No.

38:10.060 --> 38:11.900
I saw something.

38:14.200 --> 38:17.020
Right.

38:17.770 --> 38:19.700
You shouldn't be
With either of us.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.620
We're all the same.

38:22.760 --> 38:26.100
Guy like me,
Guy like simon...

38:27.640 --> 38:29.780
We're all the same.

38:43.810 --> 38:45.690
We're all just drunk.

38:45.830 --> 38:49.210
Is that what it is?
What do you mean by that?

38:49.880 --> 38:52.460
You're drunk, nathaniel.

38:52.860 --> 38:54.200
The rest of us
Are waiting to see

38:54.200 --> 38:57.340
Which one of us
Will drive you home.

39:21.060 --> 39:26.450
* i drew a picture of you

39:30.940 --> 39:33.200
You know, i should've just
Married a musician

39:33.200 --> 39:34.500
Or a basketball player.

39:34.500 --> 39:35.500
Oh, yep.

39:35.500 --> 39:40.190
At least there'd be some kind
Of vicarious thrill
That would rub off.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.570
With you surgeons,
It's just, uh...

39:43.350 --> 39:47.200
Nothing, silence,
Travel...waiting.

39:47.350 --> 39:50.200
For some big angry
Pain in the ass

39:50.200 --> 39:54.570
To come home complaining
About his day of saving lives.

39:58.980 --> 40:01.100
I'm sorry
About your wife, tom.

40:03.280 --> 40:04.640
Why won't you talk
To me about it?

40:04.780 --> 40:06.730
I don't want to.

40:06.900 --> 40:09.200
Tom, you need a friend
At a time like this.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.400
You need a friend.

40:10.400 --> 40:14.600
Yeah, well, kate,
I don't want a friend.

40:18.700 --> 40:21.500
Okay?

40:26.400 --> 40:28.400
Nate.

40:30.280 --> 40:32.010
Forgot my whiskey.

40:32.650 --> 40:33.350
I should go.

40:33.490 --> 40:35.100
No, no. Not on my account.
I'm...

40:35.690 --> 40:37.300
I should go.

40:44.550 --> 40:46.300
Hey.

40:51.520 --> 40:52.100
I'm sorry.

40:52.200 --> 40:55.900
No, no, no. You...
You have every right, you know?

40:56.000 --> 40:58.100
You have every right.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.500
What is going on
With you?

41:04.210 --> 41:06.100
Bart came home yesterday.

41:07.210 --> 41:09.800
He didn't make it
To ireland.

41:11.240 --> 41:13.200
How bad is it?

41:13.200 --> 41:15.100
He signed
The hospice forms.

41:15.580 --> 41:17.700
He just wants
Palliative care.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.330
I'm sorry.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.480
He's not gonna last
Much longer.

41:31.610 --> 41:32.800
Let me drive you home.

41:32.900 --> 41:34.700
No, no. I'm fine.
I'm fine.

41:34.700 --> 41:37.200
Okay. Well, we can stay here,
Have some coffee.

41:37.200 --> 41:40.900
I think
I'd like to be alone.

41:42.510 --> 41:46.100
Nate, i'm happy to drive you home.
I need to be alone,kate.

41:51.240 --> 41:53.970
I'm so sorry
About bart.

42:03.810 --> 42:04.900
Good night, katie.
Night.

42:04.900 --> 42:12.300
* that's how i knew this story
Would break my heart *

42:18.060 --> 42:26.400
* that's how i knew this story
Would break my heart *

42:26.940 --> 42:30.100
* when you wrote it

43:11.980 --> 43:14.600
We did a six-way domino
Today, bart.

43:15.620 --> 43:17.500
New record.

43:18.080 --> 43:20.400
Beat hopkins.

43:21.610 --> 43:25.500
You should've been there
To see it.

43:26.090 --> 43:29.200
Six-way domino transplant.

43:30.305 --> 43:36.598
