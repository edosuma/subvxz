01:56.917 --> 01:59.417
[NARRATOR] Last time on
Dragon Ball: the Dragon Balls

01:59.500 --> 02:02.792
were stolen from the hands of
our heroes by Emperor Pilaf's

02:02.875 --> 02:07.834
bumbling henchmen, Mai and Shu.
Goku led a brave trek into

02:07.917 --> 02:11.584
Emperor Pilaf's palace to
retrieve the stolen balls.

02:11.667 --> 02:15.209
Once inside, everyone followed
the writing on the ground.

02:15.292 --> 02:17.250
[YAMCHA] It's a
trap. Don't you think?

02:20.042 --> 02:22.625
[NARRATOR] Carefully, the team
crept through the caverns,

02:22.709 --> 02:26.667
trying to avoid any
unforeseen dangers.

02:27.959 --> 02:29.417
[crash]

02:29.500 --> 02:32.459
[NARRATOR] But when the wall
came crashing down, our heroes

02:32.542 --> 02:36.250
found themselves trapped
in the cold corridor.

02:36.334 --> 02:39.334
And now they wait, wondering
what the evil Emperor Pilaf

02:39.417 --> 02:41.375
has in store for them next!

02:56.834 --> 02:59.000
Nope, I don't
think it's in here.

02:59.084 --> 03:00.209
[SHU] Me, neither.

03:00.292 --> 03:02.542
C'mon, let's rip the
seats open. We've got to

03:02.625 --> 03:04.542
find that Dragon Ball.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.417
Well, looks like
we're stuck here.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.667
[OOLONG] Wonderful! Now
I get to die today, too!

03:10.750 --> 03:13.500
Hey, what's wrong?
Why're you so upset?

03:13.584 --> 03:15.250
Because we're prisoners.

03:15.334 --> 03:17.500
[GOKU] Oh, don't
worry about that.

03:17.584 --> 03:20.292
If there's a way in.
there's gotta be a way out.

03:20.375 --> 03:22.959
Goku, they're going
to try to kill us!

03:23.042 --> 03:25.334
Ha! Scary!

03:25.417 --> 03:27.500
[BULMA] Don't you
take anything seriously?!

03:31.167 --> 03:32.875
[PILAF] Those ignorant buffoons!

03:32.959 --> 03:35.542
Yes, I really do have to
hand it to myself, though.

03:35.625 --> 03:39.875
The old "Follow the Pink
Arrow" trap gets 'em every time!

03:39.959 --> 03:42.959
[laughing]

03:43.750 --> 03:44.834
[SHU] Sire!

03:46.042 --> 03:47.375
[PILAF] Speak to me.

03:47.459 --> 03:49.709
Sir, we searched the
aircar that they came here in,

03:49.792 --> 03:52.084
but the last Dragon Ball
definitely isn't in it.

03:52.167 --> 03:53.625
[PILAF] No?!

03:53.709 --> 03:56.834
That means one of
them must be carrying it!

04:02.834 --> 04:06.584
[MAI] You know, you can
never trust a short person.

04:06.667 --> 04:08.334
Surely one of those
little runts is hiding

04:08.417 --> 04:10.334
the Dragon Ball from us!

04:13.709 --> 04:16.084
[PILAF] That will be the last
time you run down short people

04:16.166 --> 04:18.750
in my presence, Agent Mai.

04:18.834 --> 04:22.167
And stop calling me 'Shirley'.
Do I make myself clear?

04:22.250 --> 04:25.125
Oh, yes, sir. I don't know
what I was thinking...

04:28.125 --> 04:29.709
You ready?

04:33.167 --> 04:34.709
Let's do it!

04:38.792 --> 04:40.209
Wolf Fang Fist!

04:40.834 --> 04:43.250
Haah!

04:43.334 --> 04:45.334
[blows landing]

04:50.834 --> 04:55.959
[blows landing]

04:56.667 --> 04:59.292
[YAMCHA] I... I didn't
even put a dent in it!

04:59.375 --> 05:01.417
The wall is too strong.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.334
[GOKU] Why don't we
give it another try?

05:04.750 --> 05:06.417
Don't hurt yourself.

05:06.792 --> 05:08.459
[laughing]

05:08.542 --> 05:11.250
What's wrong, fools?
Can't break my triple-butted

05:11.334 --> 05:14.334
double-reinforced
steel-lined walls, can you?

05:14.417 --> 05:15.917
[BULMA] Who are you?

05:16.417 --> 05:19.334
I am the all-powerful
Emperor Pilaf!

05:19.417 --> 05:22.834
So you're the jerk that
stole my Dragon Balls!

05:22.917 --> 05:25.459
Yes, this is true,
but I didn't get all of

05:25.542 --> 05:27.500
them now, did I?

05:27.917 --> 05:29.209
[GOKU] Yamcha, I
think I can get him if I

05:29.292 --> 05:30.542
dive through that window.

05:30.625 --> 05:33.042
That's a TV set,
you dummy.

05:36.750 --> 05:39.917
I know that one of you is
carrying the four-star ball.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.584
Hand it over to me and things
will go much easier for you.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.834
[BULMA] Maybe in the
next millennium, pal!

05:45.917 --> 05:47.834
Check this: bleh!

05:51.375 --> 05:54.750
So, that's how you want
to play it, little girl?

05:54.834 --> 05:57.625
All right, then. Time
for the "Treatment"!

06:03.834 --> 06:05.375
[screaming]

06:06.667 --> 06:08.959
Oh, no! He's got her!

06:09.042 --> 06:11.209
Hey, uh, what did he
mean by the "Treatment"?

06:12.209 --> 06:13.875
I... think I know...

06:18.417 --> 06:21.584
Get me out of this thing!
Right now, you freak!

06:22.209 --> 06:24.792
[PILAF] You insolent brat! I
am the great Emperor Pilaf and

06:24.875 --> 06:27.292
I will be the only one
giving orders here today!

06:27.375 --> 06:29.875
Tell me where the
last Dragon Ball is!

06:29.959 --> 06:31.334
Now!

06:31.709 --> 06:35.125
My magic finger says it's
somewhere in the ceiling!

06:35.209 --> 06:38.417
I see, you actually
want the "Treatment", don't you?

06:38.500 --> 06:41.709
Oh, you'll wish I
would have killed you.

06:41.792 --> 06:47.375
[maniacal laughter]

06:47.459 --> 06:49.792
[YAMCHA] He better
not lay a hand on her!

06:53.125 --> 06:54.417
[OOLONG] Serves her right.

06:59.709 --> 07:02.917
Not the "Treatment"!
Have a heart!

07:03.292 --> 07:04.500
No, please, Emperor!

07:26.959 --> 07:30.292
There! Now, you'll tell me
exactly what I want to hear!

07:31.209 --> 07:33.125
That's it? A kiss?

07:33.209 --> 07:36.125
Uh, yes. Pretty scary,
don't you think?

07:36.209 --> 07:40.250
[whimpering]

07:40.334 --> 07:42.500
[shy chuckling]

07:42.584 --> 07:45.042
Is that the
best you can do?

07:46.834 --> 07:50.084
Boy, she's pushing it!
She'd better clam up or he may

07:50.167 --> 07:53.750
think of something
really horrible to do to her!

07:53.834 --> 07:55.542
Man, I thought you
guys were tough!

07:55.625 --> 07:56.750
That was easy!

07:56.834 --> 07:58.042
A first-grader could
think of better torture

07:58.125 --> 08:00.750
than the "Treatment"!

08:01.250 --> 08:03.542
What?! Did you hear
what she just said?!

08:03.625 --> 08:05.000
[MAI and SHU] Yes, Emperor!

08:06.000 --> 08:07.875
[PILAF] I'll have you know
I got my degree in torture!

08:07.959 --> 08:10.459
I am a certified
master of torture!

08:10.542 --> 08:11.459
Ooh, that does it!

08:16.459 --> 08:17.667
[YAMCHA] You okay?

08:17.750 --> 08:19.542
[BULMA] Nice catch, you guys.

08:22.417 --> 08:23.834
[PILAF] This'll take time.

08:23.917 --> 08:25.750
Time to devise
the ultimate torture.

08:26.167 --> 08:27.834
[SHU] I say we go
right for the Dragon Ball!

08:27.917 --> 08:29.750
[PILAF] Quiet,
Shu! I'm devising!

08:29.834 --> 08:33.083
But, sire. We could gas them
and then conduct a search.

08:33.792 --> 08:38.167
Gas! Yes, great idea!
Let's give them some Yellow #3.

08:47.334 --> 08:48.834
[coughing]

08:48.917 --> 08:50.000
[OOLONG] Sleeping gas!

08:50.084 --> 09:00.084
[coughing]

09:00.167 --> 09:02.709
[OOLONG] They're trying
to knock us all out...

09:04.042 --> 09:07.125
[BULMA] Goku... I can't
stay awake much longer...

09:09.417 --> 09:22.917
[snoring]

09:26.167 --> 09:29.750
[PILAF] Emperor Pilaf will
always prevail, kiddies!

09:30.084 --> 09:33.625
Yes, you think you
can outsmart me?

09:33.709 --> 09:38.625
Well, I'll tell
you, ah... I... uh...

09:38.709 --> 09:44.167
I tell you... quite the...

09:44.250 --> 09:45.542
[SHU] Oh, Emperor!

09:47.917 --> 09:50.417
[MAI] How fitting. A
victim of his own vapors.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.834
Shu, you take the
Emperor back to his chambers.

09:52.917 --> 09:54.209
I'll look for the ball.

09:54.292 --> 09:55.209
[SHU] Alrighty.

09:58.792 --> 09:59.750
[MAI] Let's see here...

10:00.917 --> 10:01.875
Nope...

10:03.875 --> 10:04.875
Nothing here...

10:06.792 --> 10:07.709
What do we have here?

10:09.125 --> 10:11.417
Ahh, that's the one!

10:18.167 --> 10:21.042
Now we can summon
the Eternal Dragon!

10:52.000 --> 10:53.375
[WOMAN] Pilaf!

10:53.459 --> 10:55.917
Did you steal
those Dragon Balls?!

10:56.000 --> 10:57.500
[PILAF] Mommy?

10:57.584 --> 10:59.459
[MAI] Emperor Pilaf...

11:00.709 --> 11:02.709
Emperoror Pilaf...

11:03.292 --> 11:04.250
Emperoror Pilaf!

11:06.834 --> 11:08.792
I have great news!

11:08.875 --> 11:12.000
[MAI] We got it! We've recovered
the four-star Dragon Ball, sir.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.667
[PILAF] You did?!

11:15.750 --> 11:17.959
[MAI] Finally. The boy
with the tail had it,

11:18.042 --> 11:20.125
but here they all are.

11:20.209 --> 11:21.125
Take a look.

11:37.584 --> 11:39.584
[SHU] They're beautiful, sire!

11:50.959 --> 11:52.042
They're all mine!

12:04.584 --> 12:07.584
[snoring]

12:19.500 --> 12:24.209
[BULMA screaming]

12:24.292 --> 12:29.459
The Dragon Ball!
It's gone! It's gone!

12:29.542 --> 12:31.959
Goku, you gotta
wake up! They took it!

12:32.042 --> 12:34.917
The four-star ball
is gone! Gone!

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
They've got all
seven of them, now!

12:41.584 --> 12:43.042
Good, you're awake!

12:45.500 --> 12:46.584
I'm exhausted.

12:47.917 --> 12:49.917
Then wake up, 'cause
your Dragon Ball is gone!

12:50.000 --> 12:52.917
No way! I hid that!

12:53.000 --> 12:55.959
Oh, what if that crazy
little troll already used the

12:56.042 --> 12:59.084
balls to summon the dragon?!

12:59.167 --> 13:00.250
Great!

13:01.167 --> 13:02.834
Hey, look, the cell door's open.

13:06.042 --> 13:07.417
[BULMA] Do you think
they forgot to close it?

13:08.459 --> 13:09.959
[GOKU] It could be another trap.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.417
[YAMCHA] Yeah, but why would
they set another trap for

13:14.500 --> 13:15.917
us if we were already trapped?

13:18.042 --> 13:20.375
[BULMA] Hey, Yamcha's
right. I say we go for it!

13:20.709 --> 13:21.917
[YAMCHA] All right, then!

13:26.750 --> 13:31.625
Very soon,
the world will be mine!

13:47.459 --> 13:50.709
Have you made your wish?

13:50.792 --> 13:53.000
[PILAF] Uh-uh...

13:54.584 --> 13:56.709
Give me back my Grandpa!

13:57.500 --> 14:00.542
[screaming]

14:00.625 --> 14:01.584
Quick, get 'em!

14:08.292 --> 14:09.959
[BULMA] Now which way?!

14:10.875 --> 14:12.084
[YAMCHA] What do
you think, Goku?

14:13.042 --> 14:18.667
Gee, I-I don't know!

14:18.750 --> 14:22.459
How did they escape
from such a well-designed trap?

14:22.542 --> 14:24.334
You forgot to close the wall,
didn't you?

14:24.417 --> 14:26.709
I don't know, I thought
you were the last one out!

14:28.500 --> 14:30.834
Exactly how
stupid are you guys?!

14:31.167 --> 14:32.417
[MAI and SHU] Very stupid, sir.

14:33.875 --> 14:37.459
Well. don't expect to see
any allowances this week.

14:37.542 --> 14:40.209
And yes, you can forget
about desert as well.

14:40.292 --> 14:41.875
[MAI and SHU] But sire--!

14:41.959 --> 14:43.334
[PILAF] Silence!

14:43.667 --> 14:49.459
Now, let's see here...
Pinball! That's the penalty!

14:50.959 --> 14:52.917
[piano note]

14:53.000 --> 14:56.500

14:56.584 --> 15:00.542

15:34.000 --> 15:35.959
C'mon, Goku,
we're leaving!

15:36.959 --> 15:39.750
[GOKU] Ow, ow, ow, ow...

15:46.250 --> 15:47.875

Take that, you oversized
ball bearing! You lose!

16:11.542 --> 16:14.959
[screaming]

16:15.042 --> 16:17.542
You just had to open your mouth,
didn't you?!

16:17.625 --> 16:19.625
Like I knew
the ball had an IQ!

16:21.667 --> 16:23.417

16:32.042 --> 16:33.334
I don't wanna die like this!

16:33.417 --> 16:35.375
I'm not wearing clean underwear!

17:03.625 --> 17:05.959
[YAMCHA] It looks like there's
a tunnel behind that curtain!

17:06.041 --> 17:08.916
It could be a way
out of here, or a trap.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.916
[BULMA] What should we do?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.709
[YAMCHA] I don't know.

17:17.375 --> 17:19.375
I want my mommy...

[YAMCHA] No! We're trapped!

17:49.459 --> 17:53.209
[whimpering]

17:54.459 --> 17:55.917
[GOKU] It stopped! 

18:03.417 --> 18:04.459
That's weird.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.584
Are we alive?

18:09.167 --> 18:11.959
[crash]

18:12.959 --> 18:14.417
[GOKU] You know,
there's something

18:14.500 --> 18:16.542
familiar about this room.

18:16.625 --> 18:19.584
[BULMA] No! It's the
same room we started in!

18:23.292 --> 18:26.209
[laughter]

18:26.292 --> 18:29.125
Excellent.
You're all safe. That's nice.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.917
I was worried you wouldn't be
able to see me crowned supreme

18:32.000 --> 18:36.875
ruler of the world! Well,
I've got to go make my wish.

18:36.959 --> 18:40.000
I'll see you at my
inauguration, okay?

18:40.084 --> 18:41.125
Bye.

18:56.250 --> 18:58.584
My hour of glory
is finally at hand!

18:58.667 --> 19:00.917
Its time to summon the dragon!

19:01.417 --> 19:07.084
[maniacal laughter]

19:07.167 --> 19:11.834
Oh no! There's got to be
a way out of this tomb!

19:11.917 --> 19:14.084
Goku! You have to use
the Kamehameha Wave!

19:14.917 --> 19:17.417
I'm afraid it's our
only hope right now!

19:17.500 --> 19:19.625
I can try.

19:20.209 --> 19:22.292
[GOKU] But how do you know
about the Kamehameha Wave?

19:22.750 --> 19:24.334
Never mind that, Goku!

19:24.417 --> 19:28.042
We need every second
we can get! Now hurry!

19:29.042 --> 19:30.584
Right. I'll do it!

19:40.042 --> 19:43.125
Yes! It is time to call
the Eternal Dragon!

19:51.500 --> 19:53.584
Ka...

19:53.667 --> 20:02.292
me... ha... me...

20:02.375 --> 20:03.875
Ha!

20:09.292 --> 20:11.709
Oops! I guess I need
a little more practice.

20:11.792 --> 20:14.834
Look at that hole.
It's pretty small, huh?

20:15.375 --> 20:16.875
[YAMCHA] Thanks, Goku. Move it!

20:18.292 --> 20:20.000
Look! There they
are right there!

20:20.709 --> 20:22.334
It looks like they're
about to call the dragon.

20:22.417 --> 20:24.417
We've got to stop them!

20:24.500 --> 20:27.375
[YAMCHA] Wait, I've got it!
Puar, you think you can turn

20:27.459 --> 20:29.584
into a bat, fly down
there, and try and steal

20:29.667 --> 20:31.000
one of those Dragon Balls?

20:31.084 --> 20:32.042
Sure!

20:32.125 --> 20:33.709
Great idea!

20:42.250 --> 20:44.709
Oolong, go help her, now!

20:44.792 --> 20:46.625
Huh? Why should I?

20:46.959 --> 20:50.250
'Cause I'll yell 'piggy'
every ten seconds until you do!

20:50.334 --> 20:53.500
Easy now, Bulma,
just settle down!

20:53.875 --> 20:54.417
Alright!

20:55.542 --> 20:56.875
Hurry up, Oolong!

21:00.292 --> 21:01.125
[OOLONG] I am hurrying!

21:02.292 --> 21:04.125
Rise Eternal Dragon!
And hear the wish

21:04.209 --> 21:07.375
of he who summons you!

21:36.750 --> 21:39.084
[screaming]

22:02.042 --> 22:09.667
[whimpering]

22:10.625 --> 22:13.334
[NARRATOR] Will Emperor
Pilaf's wish be granted?

22:13.417 --> 22:16.709
Or will Puar and Oolong
be able to save our heroes

22:16.792 --> 22:18.459
and the world?

22:18.542 --> 22:22.084
Find out next time
on Dragon Ball!

22:25.917 --> 22:32.709
[roaring]

22:33.305 --> 22:39.346
