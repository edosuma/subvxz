01:44.399 --> 01:45.964
It's time to save the world.

01:45.964 --> 01:47.131
Let's do this.

02:00.003 --> 02:01.840
- Olivia, we have to get out the door!

02:01.840 --> 02:02.770
I don't want you to be late

02:02.770 --> 02:03.976
on your last day of school!

02:03.976 --> 02:04.809
- [Olivia] Okay.

02:04.809 --> 02:06.290
- I hope you didn't leave a mess.

02:06.290 --> 02:07.780
- But won't Maria get it?

02:07.780 --> 02:09.080
- No, she's not coming.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.410
I had to let her go.

02:10.410 --> 02:11.243
- Why?

02:11.243 --> 02:12.350
- We gotta cut back.

02:12.350 --> 02:14.030
- But she cleans up everything.

02:14.030 --> 02:17.620
- We're gonna be on a very
tight budget for a while,

02:17.620 --> 02:20.090
and, with the divorce, probably
gonna lose the house too.

02:20.090 --> 02:20.923
- What?

02:20.923 --> 02:21.930
- Eh, don't worry about that.

02:21.930 --> 02:23.280
That's for me to worry about.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.990
- I just hate that Mom did this.

02:24.990 --> 02:26.420
That she divorced you

02:26.420 --> 02:27.600
and is always out of town,

02:27.600 --> 02:29.480
and now we're gonna have to move,

02:29.480 --> 02:32.110
and now Maria's gone, and.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.830
- I understand your frustrated.

02:33.830 --> 02:35.760
- Hey, where's Jackson?

02:35.760 --> 02:37.486
- Oh, he left early to go to school.

02:37.486 --> 02:39.177
(phone buzzes)
- What?

02:39.177 --> 02:40.990
- Oh, well, that's strange.

02:40.990 --> 02:42.970
He just went live.

02:42.970 --> 02:46.270
It's titled Good Morning
from the Atlantic Ocean?

02:46.270 --> 02:47.340
- Awesome shot.

02:47.340 --> 02:48.173
(phone buzzes)

02:48.173 --> 02:49.870
- Oh, great, and now
your mom's gonna be here

02:49.870 --> 02:50.810
in a few minutes.

02:50.810 --> 02:52.400
She's gonna drop off some of my things

02:52.400 --> 02:53.978
before she leaves to Fiji.

02:53.978 --> 02:54.811
- Again?

02:54.811 --> 02:57.120
She's going on vacation again?

02:57.120 --> 02:58.670
- All right, come on, let's go.

02:59.582 --> 03:02.297
(hard rock music)

03:02.297 --> 03:04.880

(ice cream truck backfiring)

04:05.117 --> 04:07.867
(nose squeaking)

04:09.000 --> 04:10.640
- Hey, can I help you?

04:10.640 --> 04:12.480
- Yeah, I'm here for the job.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.020
- Come around the back
into my office, will ya?

04:14.020 --> 04:15.120
Right around the back.

04:16.870 --> 04:18.916
- Okay, go get your bike.

04:18.916 --> 04:20.704
(horn honking)

04:20.704 --> 04:22.685
(father sighs)

04:22.685 --> 04:25.102
(rock music)

04:30.882 --> 04:33.690
(angry music)

04:33.690 --> 04:35.710
- [Woman] I brought all
your junk that you wanted!

04:35.710 --> 04:37.220
- [Father] Yeah, well, it's my junk,

04:37.220 --> 04:38.230
so I do want it.

04:38.230 --> 04:40.400
- A spoon collection, really?

04:40.400 --> 04:41.790
What kind of man has a spoon collection?

04:41.790 --> 04:43.271
Get it away from me!

04:43.271 --> 04:44.240
(spoons clatter)

04:44.240 --> 04:45.940
- They're from all over the world.

04:47.010 --> 04:50.305
- Disgusting flea-infested toaster!

04:50.305 --> 04:51.527
I hate it!

04:51.527 --> 04:52.939
- Flea infested?
- Mom?

04:52.939 --> 04:53.821
What's going on?

04:53.821 --> 04:55.010
- And this piece of junk

04:55.010 --> 04:56.420
that your sister gave us?

04:56.420 --> 04:58.530
It's the cheapest piece of crap.

04:58.530 --> 04:59.363
Hi, honey.

04:59.363 --> 05:00.288
- Hi, Mom.

05:00.288 --> 05:01.121
- Get it away!

05:01.121 --> 05:01.954
- Ah.

05:03.147 --> 05:05.150
- Stupid box of crafts.

05:05.150 --> 05:07.290
Oh, how lovely.

05:07.290 --> 05:09.540
What do you say we do
a little face painting?

05:10.575 --> 05:12.610
- Mm.
- No, Janet, look.

05:12.610 --> 05:14.512
I have a job interview.

05:14.512 --> 05:15.345
(Olivia laughing)

05:15.345 --> 05:17.210
- [Janet] Green is my favorite color.

05:17.210 --> 05:18.333
You know that.

05:19.605 --> 05:21.123
We can use a little red.

05:22.750 --> 05:23.800
- Mom.
- Oh, and here's

05:23.800 --> 05:25.280
your baby powder.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.763
Oh, it's so disgusting, baby powder!

05:28.820 --> 05:29.880
Baby powder.

05:29.880 --> 05:30.840
Surprise!

05:30.840 --> 05:32.660
Here's all your stuff back.

05:32.660 --> 05:34.410
Take it little guy, ugh, take it!

05:34.410 --> 05:35.860
Take it.

05:35.860 --> 05:36.770
- Okay, honey.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.240
Have a great day at school.

05:38.240 --> 05:39.073
Okay?

05:39.073 --> 05:40.900
And tell Jackson to put away that drone

05:40.900 --> 05:42.843
and get there on time for once.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.940
- And by the way, we're
leaving for vacation tomorrow.

05:47.940 --> 05:50.800
So don't screw everything
up like you normally do.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.833
- I'll be here taking care
of the kids, as usual.

05:55.033 --> 05:57.533
(light music)

06:02.677 --> 06:04.260
- [Olivia] Parents.

06:06.171 --> 06:07.900
(feet stomping)

06:07.900 --> 06:10.567
(ominous music)

06:14.370 --> 06:17.300
- This is agent 62563A.

06:17.300 --> 06:19.900
I want to report a weaponized drone.

06:19.900 --> 06:21.610
- [Woman] Weaponized, Paul?

06:21.610 --> 06:24.606
- It's a toxic drone,
toxic to the environment.

06:24.606 --> 06:26.570
- [Woman] Toxic, Paul?

06:26.570 --> 06:28.380
- It could pollute the ocean.

06:28.380 --> 06:29.950
Not on my watch.

06:29.950 --> 06:31.100
- [Woman] Please issue a warning.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.900
- It's going down, downtown.

06:32.900 --> 06:33.833
- [Woman] Downtown?

06:34.690 --> 06:36.038
- It's a saying.

06:36.038 --> 06:37.330
You know what I mean.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.160
It's either here or downtown.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.653
Over and out.

06:44.001 --> 06:46.668
(drone buzzing)

06:49.810 --> 06:51.900
Hey, you can't fly that drone here.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.070
- What drone?

06:53.070 --> 06:53.903
- That drone.

06:53.903 --> 06:55.750
If that drone crushes into the water,

06:55.750 --> 06:57.960
it'll be spilling toxic
chemicals into the water

06:57.960 --> 07:00.770
for over 75 years, long
after we're both dead!

07:00.770 --> 07:01.750
- Speak for yourself.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.110
I've never crashed a drone.

07:03.110 --> 07:04.113
I can fly anything.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.620
- It's kids like you that are
destroying our environment

07:07.620 --> 07:09.090
and our natural resources.

07:09.090 --> 07:11.530
- My dad has the only
resource that we need, money.

07:11.530 --> 07:12.910
- Land the drone.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.833
That's it, I'm confiscating it!

07:15.730 --> 07:16.740
- Good luck.

07:16.740 --> 07:17.573
- You land it!

07:19.347 --> 07:20.879
- [Jackson] I-It's not working.

07:20.879 --> 07:21.712
- [Paul] That's it.

07:21.712 --> 07:23.584
You're going down, downtown.

07:23.584 --> 07:26.334
(dramatic music)

07:41.561 --> 07:44.144
(upbeat music)

07:49.643 --> 07:51.083
- [Jackson] It works every time.

08:03.170 --> 08:04.110
- Hey, Jackson.

08:04.110 --> 08:04.943
- [Jackson] Hey, Olivia.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.340
- Dad said to stop flying your drone.

08:06.340 --> 08:07.900
Anyway, we gotta get to school.

08:07.900 --> 08:09.050

08:51.340 --> 08:52.318
- Ice cream.

08:52.318 --> 08:55.010
- (laughs) It's ice cream.

08:55.010 --> 08:57.390
- Yes, but you gotta sell it.

08:57.390 --> 08:58.550
Let's say a kid comes up,

08:58.550 --> 08:59.440
he wants only one.

08:59.440 --> 09:03.943
I want you to sell three

Kinda sells itself, don't you think?

09:16.800 --> 09:18.060
- What's your name anyway?

09:18.060 --> 09:18.893
- Juan.

09:18.893 --> 09:20.790
- You you don't look like a Juan.

09:20.790 --> 09:22.740
- My dad was from Cuba.

09:22.740 --> 09:25.070
My mom Idaho.

09:25.070 --> 09:28.730
- Like Juan, two, three? (laughs)

09:28.730 --> 09:33.730
- Juan Jose Francisco Gonzales
dos Santos de la Riviera.

09:33.950 --> 09:34.950
- Really?

09:34.950 --> 09:35.980
- Junior.

09:35.980 --> 09:37.310
It was my dad's name.

09:37.310 --> 09:40.530
Hey, is it always this chilly in here?

09:40.530 --> 09:41.470

09:52.380 --> 09:54.840
We sell ice cream!

09:54.840 --> 09:57.263
That's what I'm gonna
name you, Chilly Chilly.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.213
- Okay.

10:00.290 --> 10:01.140
- I need some help here.

10:01.140 --> 10:03.530
My knees aren't what they used to be.

10:03.530 --> 10:04.720
- Be real fun learning

10:04.720 --> 10:07.980
from an expert ice
cream salesman like you.

10:07.980 --> 10:10.921
- All right, I need you to
go to my office door here,

10:10.921 --> 10:12.950
where it says, it's
written right on there,

10:12.950 --> 10:15.120
world's greatest ice cream salesman

10:15.120 --> 10:18.100

Get those two styrofoam

10:19.960 --> 10:22.260

- Okay.

10:33.863 --> 10:35.470
You got it, Boss.

10:35.470 --> 10:40.470
- Kingdom, phylum, class, order,
family, genus and species.

10:41.300 --> 10:45.433
Can someone give me an
example of a species?

10:46.490 --> 10:47.323
- Wolf.

10:47.323 --> 10:48.156
- Very good.

10:48.990 --> 10:51.160
Of a genus?

10:51.160 --> 10:52.793
Yes.

10:52.793 --> 10:53.955
- Albert Einstein.

10:53.955 --> 10:54.788
(kids giggle)

10:54.788 --> 10:56.883
- Albert Einstein was a genius, yes.

10:57.860 --> 10:59.010
- A mud turtle?

10:59.010 --> 11:01.410
- A mud turtle, very good.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.200
Now, can someone give me an example

11:03.200 --> 11:05.193
of my favorite family?

11:06.326 --> 11:07.817
- Anatidae?

11:07.817 --> 11:10.486
- Anatidae, very good job, Olivia.

("The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin)

11:11.720 --> 11:14.560

when the freezer kicks in.

11:14.560 --> 11:15.393
(ice cream truck backfiring)

11:15.393 --> 11:17.250
Engine has some problems too, you know.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.940
All right, Chilly, this
is one of my best spots.

11:24.940 --> 11:26.940
Those kids are gonna
be here any minute now,

11:26.940 --> 11:29.540
and all they wanna do is
try and win this contest,

11:29.540 --> 11:31.500
sponsored by that bozo billionaire

11:31.500 --> 11:33.780
kazillionaire Billy Bob Branson.

11:33.780 --> 11:34.613
- Who?

11:34.613 --> 11:35.446
- He's the guy that gave me

11:35.446 --> 11:37.640
all this promotional stuff for the truck.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.500
Besides, a white, empty ice cream truck

11:39.500 --> 11:40.800
looks kinda creepy.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.120
- He gave all of this to you?

11:43.120 --> 11:44.700
- He gave all this to me,

11:44.700 --> 11:47.420
including that ice
cream samich on the roof

11:47.420 --> 11:52.160
that I may have, uh, ha ha,
modified it a little bit.

11:52.160 --> 11:56.070
- It's too bad you work for Huncha Muncha,

11:56.070 --> 11:57.943
and you can't win the contest yourself.

11:57.943 --> 11:58.776
- Stop right there.

11:58.776 --> 12:00.170
Let me tell you something, buddy.

12:00.170 --> 12:01.460
I'm my own boss.

12:01.460 --> 12:02.920
I don't work for nobody,

12:02.920 --> 12:05.280
and I could win that money.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.350
And if anybody on my
route pulls the winning

12:07.350 --> 12:10.360
contest ticket, I'm the one that better

12:10.360 --> 12:11.720
get a piece of the action.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.323
- Well, is the contest worldwide?

12:17.750 --> 12:20.050
- According to this, regions are selected

12:20.050 --> 12:22.270
based on environmental factors.

12:22.270 --> 12:25.400
Florida represents the
Southeastern United States

12:25.400 --> 12:26.500
and the Caribbean.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.210
- Don't you have all the ice cream here

12:28.210 --> 12:30.290
with all the contests on it?

12:30.290 --> 12:31.550
How about we open a few

12:31.550 --> 12:33.600
and see if we can find an easy one?

12:33.600 --> 12:34.433
- You know what?

12:34.433 --> 12:35.266
You better wrap 'em back up

12:35.266 --> 12:36.310
so we can sell 'em again.

12:38.620 --> 12:39.980
- [Chilly] You try it, Boss.

12:39.980 --> 12:41.511
You seem smart.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.300
("The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin)

12:43.300 --> 12:45.200
- What's the distance to the sun

12:45.200 --> 12:48.100
divided by the circumference of the moon?

12:48.100 --> 12:50.535
Takes this number and times it

12:50.535 --> 12:54.680
times the square root
of the distance to Mars.

12:54.680 --> 12:57.743
And then, uh, oh, man!

13:00.550 --> 13:03.560
- Hey, I think I found one I can solve.

13:03.560 --> 13:04.569
- Wait.

13:04.569 --> 13:06.453
Type it in, type it in!

13:06.453 --> 13:09.453
(suspenseful music)

13:11.830 --> 13:14.810
- [Chilly] Oh, there he
is, Scrooge McMoneygills.

13:14.810 --> 13:16.750
Looky, looky here.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.600
I got a hunch, Boss.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.935
Let's check it out.

13:19.935 --> 13:22.685
(exciting music)

13:28.070 --> 13:30.330
- Howdy, I'm Billy Bob Branson.

13:30.330 --> 13:32.680
I have founded, built and sold off

13:32.680 --> 13:34.640
more companies than I can count.

13:34.640 --> 13:37.733
But you never forget your first,

13:37.733 --> 13:39.660
Huncha Muncha ice cream.

13:39.660 --> 13:42.720
My company has factories
all around the world,

13:42.720 --> 13:45.100
and they were made all the more profitable

13:45.100 --> 13:49.840
thanks to some extremely lax
environmental regulations.

13:49.840 --> 13:54.170
Then, in 2014, a category
five hurricane swept

13:54.170 --> 13:56.330
across one of my private islands.

13:56.330 --> 13:59.020
My house was smashed to smithereens.

13:59.020 --> 14:01.750
It was a complete loss,
due in part to the fact

14:01.750 --> 14:05.600
that there is no secondary
market for smithereens.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.250
Now, I studied this event,

14:07.250 --> 14:10.940
and I discovered that extreme
weather events like this

14:10.940 --> 14:12.910
are on the rise around the globe.

14:12.910 --> 14:14.570
And they're caused, in part,

14:14.570 --> 14:17.653
by the type of pollution that
factories like mine emit.

14:18.532 --> 14:21.630
Now, I rebuilt that house
better than ever before.

14:21.630 --> 14:23.050
And in a similar manner,

14:23.050 --> 14:25.320
I want to use my business acumen

14:25.320 --> 14:28.160
to rebuild our relationship
with the planet,

14:28.160 --> 14:29.980
so that we can live in greater harmony

14:29.980 --> 14:32.530
with nature than ever before.

14:32.530 --> 14:34.950
And that's where you come in.

14:34.950 --> 14:36.710
You see, I collaborated

14:36.710 --> 14:40.170
with the top scientists,
expert psychologists

14:40.170 --> 14:42.800
and the very best middle
school science teachers

14:42.800 --> 14:45.260
to design a contest that would unearth

14:45.260 --> 14:47.450
the smartest people in the world.

14:47.450 --> 14:49.660
I call them Planet Puzzlers.

14:49.660 --> 14:51.010
They shall examine questions

14:51.010 --> 14:56.010
such as global warming, war,
poverty and so much more.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.510
This contest will be rolled out in regions

14:58.510 --> 15:02.124
around the world based on
specific climate change factors

15:02.124 --> 15:04.640
and where my products are sold.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.950
This will be the most fun,

15:05.950 --> 15:09.330
the most challenging contest
the world has ever seen,

15:09.330 --> 15:10.980
fun and challenging as defined

15:10.980 --> 15:12.930
in the terms and
conditions of the contest.

15:12.930 --> 15:15.327
See website for complete details.

15:15.327 --> 15:18.077

15:21.635 --> 15:24.885
- Ah man, battery's almost dead.

15:24.885 --> 15:26.911
We got a mouse problem.

15:26.911 --> 15:27.744
(mice squeaking)

15:27.744 --> 15:31.870
- Action, not inaction was
the lesson they were taught.

15:31.870 --> 15:35.137
Okay, kids, your assignment is to reread

15:35.137 --> 15:36.860
"Should, Could and Would,"

15:36.860 --> 15:38.930
the award-winning kids' educational book

15:38.930 --> 15:40.960
about entrepreneurship.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.680
Now, over the summer, I hope you come back

15:42.680 --> 15:45.230
and have a story about how you took action

15:45.230 --> 15:47.983
to solve a problem either big or small.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.193
(school bell rings)

15:50.193 --> 15:51.511
Okay, kids, have a great summer.

15:51.511 --> 15:54.121
(kids cheering)

15:54.121 --> 15:56.133
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, y'all.

15:56.133 --> 15:58.421
- [Girl] Let's go get ice cream.

15:58.421 --> 15:59.855

Aventura Times Elementary

15:59.855 --> 16:02.032
and Junior High School,

16:02.032 --> 16:04.601
this is your principal
Mr. Hucklebuckfinsky.

16:04.601 --> 16:07.029
I just want to wish you and your family

16:07.029 --> 16:09.077
a safe and wonderful-

16:09.077 --> 16:09.910
- Hurry.

16:09.910 --> 16:11.650
The kids are comin'.

16:11.650 --> 16:14.640
- [Olivia] Look, a dollar.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.190
- Well, if we only had 499,999 more,

16:17.190 --> 16:19.380
we could buy a house here in Florida.

16:19.380 --> 16:21.340
- A house costs half a million dollars?

16:21.340 --> 16:22.310
- Pretty much.

16:22.310 --> 16:23.470
- At least we now have enough

16:23.470 --> 16:24.930
to buy us each some ice cream.

16:24.930 --> 16:25.935
- We do?

16:25.935 --> 16:26.768
- [Olivia] Yeah.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.135
I didn't spend my lunch money.

16:28.135 --> 16:30.050
- Huncha Muncha, please.

16:30.050 --> 16:31.790
- Hey, Boss, check this out.

16:31.790 --> 16:33.600
You want three?

16:33.600 --> 16:35.870
Sure is a lot of you.

16:35.870 --> 16:38.110
Please pull around to the second window.

16:38.110 --> 16:41.435
Pull around to the second window, please.

16:41.435 --> 16:42.881
(light music)

16:42.881 --> 16:44.694
- [Olivia] Huncha Muncha.

16:44.694 --> 16:46.330
- Here you go, kid.

16:46.330 --> 16:47.410
- W-w-w-w-wait!

16:47.410 --> 16:49.020
We haven't checked that one yet, Chilly.

16:49.020 --> 16:52.060
- Ah, don't worry about it.

16:52.060 --> 16:55.110
It's like a one in a million chance.

16:55.110 --> 16:57.890
Even adults can't solve it.

16:57.890 --> 17:02.360
There's no way a dumb little girl will.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.160
Go ahead, little girl.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.093
Show my boss you're a loser!

17:08.970 --> 17:09.803
Stupid.

17:11.630 --> 17:12.463
- Okay.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.110
So important are these three,

17:15.110 --> 17:19.000
the land, air and sea to all
of life including humanity.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.500
Can you name the family
that lives on all three?

17:21.500 --> 17:22.860
To make the planet better,

17:22.860 --> 17:24.850
what's a family that has eight letters?

17:24.850 --> 17:25.779
Oh, that's easy.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.375
Anatidae.

17:27.375 --> 17:28.246
- What?

17:28.246 --> 17:29.570
- Anatidae?

17:29.570 --> 17:32.140
- Anatidae? What?

17:32.140 --> 17:35.970
- Auntie Mandy's my favorite auntie.

17:35.970 --> 17:37.090
- It's a scientific family

17:37.090 --> 17:38.980
in the classification of species.

17:38.980 --> 17:40.230
My teacher loves birds,

17:40.230 --> 17:42.570
and some birds live on land, air and sea.

17:42.570 --> 17:43.760
It's one of the greatest families

17:43.760 --> 17:45.700
because it lives in all three,

17:45.700 --> 17:47.670
land, air and sea.

17:47.670 --> 17:50.013
- Quick, type it in, type it in!

17:54.278 --> 17:56.228
- [Chilly] How do you spell that, Boss?

17:59.377 --> 18:00.255
- [Olivia] I won.

18:00.255 --> 18:03.249
Oh my golly gee whiz leaner, I won.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.990
- [Kids] We won!

18:04.990 --> 18:06.823
- [Chilly] Wha, wha.

18:06.823 --> 18:08.075
Gimme that back!

18:08.075 --> 18:09.161
- [Olivia] No, no!

18:09.161 --> 18:09.994
- Now, get outta here, kids!

18:09.994 --> 18:11.313
Scram!

18:11.313 --> 18:13.896
(kids yelling)

18:16.694 --> 18:17.527

18:17.527 --> 18:19.227
- [Girl] Get back here!

18:19.227 --> 18:21.770
Get back you little thief!

Get back!

calling for Mr. Brad Johnson.

18:36.964 --> 18:37.851
- [Brad] Yeah, this is he.

18:37.851 --> 18:38.908
- [Man On Phone] Mr. Brad Johnson.

18:38.908 --> 18:40.290
- Well, yeah, this is he.

18:40.290 --> 18:41.123
- [Man On Phone] Um,
yeah, you're gonna get

18:41.123 --> 18:42.790
foreclosed on.
- You just called.

18:42.790 --> 18:43.700
- Yeah, foreclosure.
- Hi, Dad.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.340
- Yeah, you're getting
- Foreclosure?

18:45.340 --> 18:46.680
No.
- Foreclosed on.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.290
- Just a sec, kids.
- You are a loser.

18:48.290 --> 18:49.123
Loser.
- Shall we tell Dad

18:49.123 --> 18:49.956
about the contest?

18:49.956 --> 18:52.570
- Uh, Dad already has enough on his plate.

18:52.570 --> 18:53.923
- [Brad] In the last hour.

19:03.660 --> 19:05.110
- What are we gonna do?

19:05.110 --> 19:05.943
- About what?

19:07.020 --> 19:08.420
- Did you hear Dad?

19:08.420 --> 19:09.440
He's behind on bills.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.890
He can't pay the mortgage.

19:10.890 --> 19:12.240
- Mortgage?

19:12.240 --> 19:13.610
- It's like a house payment.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.360
We're not gonna be able
to live here anymore.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.890
- Oh yeah, he did mention
that this morning,

19:17.890 --> 19:21.190
but I thought we had some, you know, time.

19:21.190 --> 19:23.593
- Foreclosure, we're
going to lose the house.

19:25.630 --> 19:26.517
What are you reading?

19:26.517 --> 19:28.750
- "Should Could and Would"
for the summer report.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.490
It's a classic children's book

19:30.490 --> 19:33.580
about three gnomes who
had a beat up old house.

19:33.580 --> 19:34.980
- You're already reading it?

19:34.980 --> 19:36.847
You just got home from school.

19:36.847 --> 19:39.190
- "Should Could and Would"
had a tiny little spot

19:39.190 --> 19:41.930
found at the top of a large sunny rock,

19:41.930 --> 19:44.910
a simple shanty house
that didn't have a lock,

19:44.910 --> 19:48.020
a healthy, happy home it surely was not.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.510
Action, not inaction was
the lesson they were taught.

19:50.510 --> 19:52.030
- Man, what are we gonna do?

19:52.030 --> 19:55.770
I feel so helpless yet hungry.

19:55.770 --> 19:57.130
- And to make things worse,

19:57.130 --> 19:58.910
I have homework to do.

19:58.910 --> 19:59.743
- Burn it.

19:59.743 --> 20:01.490
- I can't burn my homework!

20:01.490 --> 20:02.670
I'll flunk.

20:02.670 --> 20:04.880
- It's elementary school, who cares?

20:04.880 --> 20:07.540
- Action, not inaction was
the lesson they were taught.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.010
- Action, not inaction?

20:09.010 --> 20:10.630
- Are you thinking that I'm thinking?

20:10.630 --> 20:11.880
- Pizza, great idea!

20:11.880 --> 20:12.713
I'll order.

20:12.713 --> 20:15.382
- No, action, not inaction.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.250
We have to get my ice cream wrapper back.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.067
It's mine, I won it,

20:19.067 --> 20:20.300
and we need to get it back

20:20.300 --> 20:21.890
from those creepy ice cream men.

20:21.890 --> 20:24.400
- We need a plan and a pizza.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.570
- Oh my golly gee whiz leaner!

20:26.570 --> 20:29.410
I hear 'em, those stinkin' ice cream men.

20:29.410 --> 20:31.206
Sounds like they're pretty close.

20:31.206 --> 20:33.060
("The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin)

20:33.060 --> 20:35.863
You think there's any way to
get our winning wrapper back?

20:39.760 --> 20:41.220
Think we could catch 'em?

20:41.220 --> 20:42.640
- For what?

20:42.640 --> 20:44.700
- To get my winning wrapper back.

20:44.700 --> 20:45.820
- Not on foot.

20:45.820 --> 20:47.560
- What about on our bikes?

20:47.560 --> 20:48.844
- We don't know where they are,

20:48.844 --> 20:50.750
and, even if we did,
they could just take off.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.650
- Good point.

20:51.650 --> 20:53.323
They are in a truck.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.440
- I have an idea.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.166
- What are you doing?

20:58.166 --> 20:59.289
(scheming music)

20:59.289 --> 21:01.782
(Brad talking on phone)

21:01.782 --> 21:04.365
(dogs barking)

21:10.498 --> 21:13.248
(dramatic music)

21:26.779 --> 21:29.362
(amazed music)

21:38.660 --> 21:41.410
(dramatic music)

21:42.652 --> 21:43.750
What do you see?

21:43.750 --> 21:44.583
- I'm tracking.

21:48.100 --> 21:49.210
I still got them.

21:49.210 --> 21:50.960
They're parking in the back office.

21:52.360 --> 21:53.193
The big guy's getting out,

21:53.193 --> 21:54.720
and the dumb one's fixing the computer.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.900
- [Brad] I sent my
cover letter and resume.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.540
- Great.
- Nothing more I can do?

21:58.540 --> 21:59.373
- [Man On Phone] Just be here in one hour

21:59.373 --> 22:00.206
for the interview.

22:00.206 --> 22:01.039
- Okay.

22:01.039 --> 22:01.987
- See you then.
- I'll be there.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.100
- See you then, Johnson.
- In an hour.

22:03.100 --> 22:03.933
Got it.

22:03.933 --> 22:06.020
- [Jackson] They look like
they're about to register it.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.335
- Do something!

22:07.335 --> 22:08.319
(dramatic music)

22:08.319 --> 22:09.235
(walkie talkie beeps)

22:09.235 --> 22:11.093
Hey, that's not your ticket!

22:12.040 --> 22:13.340
Give it back, you creeps!

22:13.340 --> 22:15.219
You won't get away with this.
- What?

22:15.219 --> 22:16.640
What the?

22:16.640 --> 22:18.090
Hey, Boss!

22:18.090 --> 22:20.623
There's a helicopter lookin' at me.

22:20.623 --> 22:22.360
- Give us back our winning ticket.

22:22.360 --> 22:23.193
I'm warning you.

22:23.193 --> 22:25.660
- Get outta here!

22:25.660 --> 22:27.790
- [Jackson] You got to the count of three.

22:27.790 --> 22:28.623
One.

22:28.623 --> 22:31.530
- I almost got it, Boss.
- Two, three.

22:31.530 --> 22:33.180
- What about your drone?

22:33.180 --> 22:34.013
- It's on warranty.

22:34.013 --> 22:34.890
It doesn't matter.

22:34.890 --> 22:36.190
Either way, we have to go.

22:38.429 --> 22:39.309
(sneaky music)

22:39.309 --> 22:40.142
- Bye, Dad.

22:40.142 --> 22:41.480
- Where are you guys going?

22:41.480 --> 22:43.570
- To the library for...

22:43.570 --> 22:45.400
- A report about taking action.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.640
- Yeah, action, not inaction

22:46.640 --> 22:47.710
was the lesson they were taught.

22:47.710 --> 22:48.543
- Homework?

22:48.543 --> 22:49.440
But it's summer.

22:49.440 --> 22:50.273
- I'm helping her too.

22:50.273 --> 22:51.850
- Do you guys want a ride?

22:51.850 --> 22:52.683
- We're good.

22:52.683 --> 22:53.900
- [Olivia] I'm gonna go get my bag.

22:53.900 --> 22:54.970
- Okay.

22:54.970 --> 22:57.020
Wait, get the smoke bombs.

22:57.020 --> 22:57.853
- Boss!

22:57.853 --> 22:59.350
I got it, Boss!

22:59.350 --> 23:02.680
Says somethin' about town of clues,

23:02.680 --> 23:04.603
high in the sky.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.968
Oh man, it went out again.

23:07.968 --> 23:10.889
(dramatic music)

23:10.889 --> 23:13.093
Boss, we got a problem.

23:14.050 --> 23:16.327
All right, Boss, we got it under control.

23:16.327 --> 23:17.433
- Ah, my truck.

23:18.280 --> 23:20.055
My truck, my truck.

23:20.055 --> 23:21.972
- It's just smoke bomb.

23:25.062 --> 23:27.979
(victorious music)

23:31.532 --> 23:32.883
(lips blowing)

23:32.883 --> 23:33.716
(Boss squeaking)

23:33.716 --> 23:35.270
You happy now, Boss?

23:35.270 --> 23:36.220
- Yes, yes.

23:36.220 --> 23:37.790
- You saved your truck?

23:37.790 --> 23:38.980
- It's my truck.

23:38.980 --> 23:41.051
I worked very hard for this truck, buddy.

23:41.051 --> 23:43.634
(sneaky music)

23:45.330 --> 23:46.580
- [Jackson] The password's on the back.

23:46.580 --> 23:49.143
Change the password so
they can't log in again.

23:50.790 --> 23:51.623
- Got it.

23:52.480 --> 23:53.313
Let's see.

23:54.580 --> 23:58.135
I'll change it to action not inaction.

23:58.135 --> 23:58.968
We're in!

24:02.115 --> 24:04.865
(exciting music)

24:10.060 --> 24:11.880
- Well, firstly, if you are watching this,

24:11.880 --> 24:15.100
congratulations, I am very impressed.

24:15.100 --> 24:16.940
You have used your intelligence,

24:16.940 --> 24:19.900
imagination and creativity to successfully

24:19.900 --> 24:21.370
solve the first puzzle.

24:21.370 --> 24:23.329
All expenses will be reimbursed only

24:23.329 --> 24:24.830
for the contest winners.

24:24.830 --> 24:26.420
We can't afford to fly everyone

24:26.420 --> 24:28.350
all over the world looking for clues.

24:28.350 --> 24:30.820
However, if you win, you win big!

24:30.820 --> 24:33.720
So good luck and Godspeed.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.560
It's not on the land or the sea,

24:35.560 --> 24:38.270
but we can't breathe if you
don't care about our air.

24:38.270 --> 24:40.380
What you must do in the town of clues

24:40.380 --> 24:42.700
is to get high in the sky that is blue,

24:42.700 --> 24:44.010
using the fewest greenhouse

24:44.010 --> 24:45.027
- Town of clues?
- gas emissions

24:45.027 --> 24:46.190
is your mission.

24:46.190 --> 24:48.480
Find the molecule with many warnings.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.190
It's directly linked to the calamity

24:50.190 --> 24:52.000
known as global warming.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.730
If your spirit is
unbroken within the clue,

24:54.730 --> 24:56.444
you will discover the token.

24:56.444 --> 24:59.194
(exciting music)

25:01.930 --> 25:03.110
- Carbon emissions?

25:03.110 --> 25:03.943
Town of clues?

25:03.943 --> 25:05.264
Like a clue town.

25:05.264 --> 25:06.097
(suspenseful music)

25:06.097 --> 25:09.520
Let's see, clue town, clues town.

25:09.520 --> 25:10.353
Got it.

25:11.190 --> 25:13.410
There's a town called Clewiston.

25:13.410 --> 25:15.010
Hmm.

25:15.010 --> 25:16.160
Ooh, we can take a bus.

25:19.340 --> 25:20.660
There's one leaving soon.

25:20.660 --> 25:22.320
Glad I've been saving my allowance.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.210
- What are we gonna tell Dad?

25:24.210 --> 25:25.210
- Maybe we can say

25:25.210 --> 25:26.180
that we're going to Mom.

25:26.180 --> 25:28.000
- But she's on vacation.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.050
Maybe you can say that
she changed her mind.

25:30.050 --> 25:32.287
- Yeah, because her
idiot boyfriend is sick

25:32.287 --> 25:33.943
and they had to come home early.

25:34.871 --> 25:35.704
- I can do this.

25:35.704 --> 25:36.770
I just need Dad's phone for a bit.

25:36.770 --> 25:38.340
- Okay.

25:38.340 --> 25:40.590
- [Brad] I do consider
myself to be a person

25:40.590 --> 25:42.580
of good moral character.

25:42.580 --> 25:43.960
Why are you asking me this?

25:43.960 --> 25:44.793
That doesn't seem-

25:44.793 --> 25:45.690
- [Jackson] Hey, Dad.

25:45.690 --> 25:47.390
- Wait, just give me a minute, okay?

25:47.390 --> 25:48.550
- Okay.
- What?

25:48.550 --> 25:50.103
Listen, I.

25:51.130 --> 25:51.963
Okay.

25:51.963 --> 25:52.860
I just need some time.

25:52.860 --> 25:54.260
We're gonna move.

25:54.260 --> 25:55.410
I'm going through a divorce,

25:55.410 --> 25:57.640
and my credit is shot, as you know.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.770
I just, and my wife,

25:59.770 --> 26:04.770
my ex-wife is getting back
to me on some things I.

26:06.530 --> 26:07.363
What's uh.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.140
Jackson, did you need something?

26:11.140 --> 26:12.120
- Huh?

26:12.120 --> 26:12.953
No, no, no, no, no.

26:12.953 --> 26:13.786
I'm good, I'm good.

26:16.860 --> 26:19.580
Mom, you're not going on vacation?

26:19.580 --> 26:22.020
You're picking us up in an hour or two?

26:22.020 --> 26:22.853
All right.

26:23.910 --> 26:24.960
- Wait, what?

26:24.960 --> 26:26.660
Let me talk to her.
- Well, she had to go.

26:26.660 --> 26:29.230
- Oh, so she's not going on vacation?

26:29.230 --> 26:30.580
- No, her boyfriend's sick.

26:31.584 --> 26:32.544
- Oh.
(phone buzzing)

26:32.544 --> 26:35.600
I just got a text from her.

26:35.600 --> 26:36.460
Well, that works out.

26:36.460 --> 26:39.520
I have a job interview, so, all right.

26:39.520 --> 26:40.960
Man, that ice cream truck
(Jackson gasps)

26:40.960 --> 26:42.439
guy is persistent.

26:42.439 --> 26:43.272
("The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin)

26:43.272 --> 26:44.217
Do you want some?

26:44.217 --> 26:45.260
- Sure.

26:45.260 --> 26:46.260
- All right.

26:48.300 --> 26:50.620
- Olivia, ice cream.

26:50.620 --> 26:51.453
- [Olivia] Oh no.

26:52.940 --> 26:54.000
- Hey, how's it going?

26:54.000 --> 26:58.110
Uh, well, two Huncha Munchas, I guess.

26:58.110 --> 26:59.360
- How about three?

26:59.360 --> 27:01.026
- No, two.

27:01.026 --> 27:01.859
- That'll be $4.

27:02.909 --> 27:04.610
- Good afternoon, sir.
- How you doin'?

27:04.610 --> 27:05.510
- Is that your house?

27:05.510 --> 27:07.590
- Yeah, this is it.

27:07.590 --> 27:08.480
- I noticed a couple of children

27:08.480 --> 27:09.940
there in the window.

27:09.940 --> 27:11.420
Are those your kids?

27:11.420 --> 27:13.510
- Yeah, yeah, those are my kids.

27:13.510 --> 27:15.190
Gonna be on their own for a little while

27:15.190 --> 27:16.260
this afternoon, so I figure

27:16.260 --> 27:18.070
I better buy some cooperation.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.540
- They're gonna be home alone you said?

27:19.540 --> 27:23.732
- Yeah, I got a job
interview, so, you know.

27:23.732 --> 27:25.382
All right.
- That'll be $4.

27:25.382 --> 27:26.720
- Nobody else in the house?
- Nope.

27:26.720 --> 27:29.100
- Two frozen babysitters.
- There you go.

27:29.100 --> 27:29.933
Now we're talkin'.

27:29.933 --> 27:31.940
- Uh, we'll circle around a few times

27:31.940 --> 27:33.430
to keep an eye on them if you like, sir.

27:33.430 --> 27:34.463
If that'd make
- That's really

27:34.463 --> 27:35.930
- you feel more comfortable?

27:35.930 --> 27:37.500
Is that all right?
- not necessary.

27:37.500 --> 27:38.727
- Oh, we're in the neighborhood anyway.

27:38.727 --> 27:39.600
- No.
- It's easy.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.900
- Whatever, you guys.
- Hey, don't worry

27:41.900 --> 27:43.000
about a thing.
- Sure.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.270
- Well, please, have a good day.

27:44.270 --> 27:45.103
- Okay, all right.
- Good luck

27:45.103 --> 27:45.936
with the job interview.
- Okay.

27:45.936 --> 27:47.540
- And take your time.
- That's just fine.

27:47.540 --> 27:48.960
- Don't worry.
- Freaks.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.220
- Don't rush.

27:50.220 --> 27:51.233
Have a nice day.

27:52.260 --> 27:53.093
Arrivederci!

27:55.795 --> 27:57.126
(light music)

27:57.126 --> 27:57.959
- Hi, Dad.

27:57.959 --> 27:59.422
- What are you guys doing?

27:59.422 --> 28:01.781
- Um, well.
- Uh, uh, it's our game.

28:01.781 --> 28:03.290
- Okay.

28:03.290 --> 28:05.740
I've got my job interview.
- Okay.

28:05.740 --> 28:07.400
- And your mom's coming soon, right?

28:07.400 --> 28:08.460
- Yeah.
- Um hmm.

28:08.460 --> 28:10.186
- Okay, so I'll see you later.

28:10.186 --> 28:11.019
- You better hurry.

28:11.019 --> 28:12.140
You don't want to be late.

28:12.140 --> 28:13.511
- You be good.

28:13.511 --> 28:14.717
- Um hmm, all right.
- Okay.

28:14.717 --> 28:15.550
All right.

28:18.580 --> 28:20.410
- What are we gonna do?

28:20.410 --> 28:21.500
- I have an idea.

28:21.500 --> 28:22.576
Follow me.

28:22.576 --> 28:25.326
(scheming music)

28:28.300 --> 28:29.490
- What are we gonna do?

28:29.490 --> 28:31.767
- I have an idea that's gonna shock 'em.

28:51.457 --> 28:53.355
(sparks sizzling)

28:53.355 --> 28:55.272
- Coast is clear, Boss.

28:57.590 --> 28:58.423
Yah!

29:00.490 --> 29:01.520
- Hey.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.336
- What's up, Boss?

29:03.336 --> 29:04.190
- See that door?

29:04.190 --> 29:05.570
- Right there behind that tree?

29:05.570 --> 29:07.700
- We need to get behind that door

29:07.700 --> 29:10.260
to get those kids that have the clue.

29:10.260 --> 29:11.340
Understand?
- What clue?

29:11.340 --> 29:14.500
- From the Huncha Muncha
wrapper, for the treasure.

29:14.500 --> 29:15.420
- What treasure?

29:15.420 --> 29:18.213
- For the treasure we've
been looking for all day!

29:18.213 --> 29:19.463
- [Chilly] Ugh!

29:20.310 --> 29:22.014
- How many times I need to tell you?

29:22.014 --> 29:23.347
- Oh, all right.

29:24.363 --> 29:25.700
- [Olivia] Are you ready to kill 'em?

29:25.700 --> 29:26.800
- [Jackson] It's good.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.230
- [Chilly] Are you sure he's gone?

29:30.230 --> 29:31.590
- [Boss] He's gone.

29:31.590 --> 29:33.450
All right, now, Chilly,
- Yeah?

29:33.450 --> 29:34.700
- [Boss] Kick that door open.

29:34.700 --> 29:36.600
So we can get in there
and get that wrapper.

29:36.600 --> 29:37.593
- Yah!
- Kick it!

29:38.780 --> 29:40.905
Do it again.
- Chop suey!

29:40.905 --> 29:42.465
- Again.
- Chop suey!

29:42.465 --> 29:43.964
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

29:43.964 --> 29:44.797
Look.

29:44.797 --> 29:46.130
- Uh!

29:46.130 --> 29:47.449
Oh man, a key.

29:47.449 --> 29:48.743

(Chilly blubbering)

29:51.053 --> 29:53.720
(Boss laughing)

30:00.950 --> 30:02.559
- [Boss] He just got electrocuted.

30:02.559 --> 30:04.059
He's all fried up.

30:07.463 --> 30:09.860
(sneaky music)

30:09.860 --> 30:10.914
- Wait.

30:10.914 --> 30:11.750
Do you have those pliers?

30:11.750 --> 30:13.150
- Yeah.
- I have an idea.

30:13.150 --> 30:13.983
- Hey, there they go.

30:13.983 --> 30:15.119
Look, there are the kids.

30:15.119 --> 30:16.900
- There. (blubbering)

30:16.900 --> 30:17.733
- Go get 'em.

30:17.733 --> 30:18.717
Go get 'em, Chilly.

30:18.717 --> 30:20.588
(Chilly blubbering)

30:20.588 --> 30:22.643
(air hissing)

30:22.643 --> 30:24.680
Chilly, we got a flat tire now!

30:24.680 --> 30:25.513
- Of course we do.
- We gotta get

30:25.513 --> 30:26.970
to the shop now.

30:26.970 --> 30:29.010
- [Chilly] Nothing goes
right with us, Boss.

30:29.010 --> 30:30.660
- Oh, man.

30:30.660 --> 30:32.370
Here, try cleaning yourself up.

30:32.370 --> 30:33.253
You're a mess.

30:35.860 --> 30:36.693
Ay yi yi.

30:39.270 --> 30:40.970
- [Chilly] Let's go fix this flat.

30:41.850 --> 30:44.360
- [Boss] We gotta figure
out where the clue is.

30:44.360 --> 30:46.350
- [Chilly] There's a
great shop up the road

30:46.350 --> 30:47.981
if you speak Mexican.

30:49.242 --> 30:52.210
(sneaky music)

30:52.210 --> 30:53.930
- We're supposed to find a molecule.

30:53.930 --> 30:56.000
How are we going to find a molecule?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.270
I mean, like, they're pretty tiny, right?

30:58.270 --> 31:00.100
- How are we gonna get high in the sky?

31:00.100 --> 31:02.930
- I was thinking maybe a plane?

31:02.930 --> 31:03.913
Here comes the bus!

31:04.830 --> 31:06.400
There's wi-fi on the bus.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.030
We'll just search up planes

31:08.030 --> 31:10.293
and transportation and stuff there.

31:17.450 --> 31:20.530
- Boss, kids, town of clues.

31:20.530 --> 31:22.040
Town of clues.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.656
And ideas?

31:23.656 --> 31:25.940
- No, it's uh nothing to mind.

31:25.940 --> 31:26.773
- Oh.

31:27.669 --> 31:29.689
(speaking in foreign language)

31:29.689 --> 31:30.630
- Bless you.

31:30.630 --> 31:34.260
- Oh, no, no, it's the town of clues.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.181
Yeah, yeah.

31:35.181 --> 31:36.431
It's Clewiston.

31:37.314 --> 31:38.628
- Yes, yup.
- Clewiston, Florida.

31:38.628 --> 31:40.655
Like a clues town.

31:40.655 --> 31:41.560
Clewiston.

31:41.560 --> 31:45.250
Yeah, man, we used to get way
high in the sky there, man.

31:45.250 --> 31:46.830
Yeah.
- What?

31:46.830 --> 31:49.030
- Yeah, yeah, you know like hang gliding.

31:49.030 --> 31:50.360
- Hmm?
- Hand gliding?

31:50.360 --> 31:51.500
- No, no, hang gliding.

31:51.500 --> 31:55.310
You go (whistles) way
in the sky, you know?

31:55.310 --> 32:00.310
It's like they pull you
behind the like a slow plane

32:00.390 --> 32:03.333
up in the sky, total tranquilo.

32:04.230 --> 32:06.310
- I think that's where the kids might be.

32:06.310 --> 32:09.050
- Sometimes they make you a, a truck

32:09.050 --> 32:11.190
with a rope, and they drag you behind.

32:11.190 --> 32:12.340
You going to go hang gliding

32:12.340 --> 32:13.780
way high in the sky?
- This guy.

32:13.780 --> 32:14.980
Yeah, this guy.

32:14.980 --> 32:17.399
- You go in the sky?
- This guy.

32:26.449 --> 32:30.366

32:33.621 --> 32:36.137
- Is he making fun of me?

32:36.137 --> 32:37.459
- I have no idea.

32:37.459 --> 32:38.950
- Don't you forget, I'm the boss here.

32:38.950 --> 32:39.800
Nobody makes fun of the boss.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.900
'Cause I can fly, and I'm gonna get

32:41.900 --> 32:43.190
those kids and those clues.

32:43.190 --> 32:44.090
You watch.

32:44.090 --> 32:44.923
Watch me.

32:48.354 --> 32:49.680
("The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin)

32:49.680 --> 32:50.780
- No airports.

32:50.780 --> 32:51.720
No nothing.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.470
Just this one hang gliding place.

32:53.470 --> 32:55.040
- No mission is the mission.

32:55.040 --> 32:58.310
- I think there's a bus stop
near the hang gliding place.

32:58.310 --> 33:01.350
- Do you think humans are
causing global warming?

33:01.350 --> 33:04.030
- I just think people should
clean up after themselves.

33:04.030 --> 33:05.150
Every kid knows that.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.450
I'm gonna turn off our track app,

33:06.450 --> 33:08.400
so Dad doesn't know we left.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.990
You know, I think regardless
of global warming,

33:10.990 --> 33:13.930
people are definitely
polluting earth's land,

33:13.930 --> 33:17.296
air and water with all kinds of chemicals.

33:17.296 --> 33:20.379
(apprehensive music)

33:22.411 --> 33:23.244
It's close to here.

33:23.244 --> 33:24.570
Just a mile down an old dirt road.

33:29.690 --> 33:32.290
It's easy to fly a hang glider.

33:32.290 --> 33:34.140
- [Jackson] Yeah, it said if
you can steer a shopping cart

33:34.140 --> 33:35.900
you can fly a hang glider.

33:35.900 --> 33:37.560
- [Olivia] A shopping
cart's on the ground.

33:37.560 --> 33:39.660
And last time you steered
the shopping cart,

33:39.660 --> 33:42.520
you knocked over the tomato can display.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.520
- [Jackson] Yeah, well that won't happen

33:43.520 --> 33:44.500
flying a hang glider.

33:44.500 --> 33:45.630
- [Olivia] Why not?

33:45.630 --> 33:47.280
- [Jackson] Because there's
no tomato can displays

33:47.280 --> 33:48.400
in the sky.

33:48.400 --> 33:49.807
- [Olivia] Good point.

33:49.807 --> 33:51.700
- [Boss] Ugh, where is this place?

33:51.700 --> 33:53.130
- [Chilly] Follow that duck!

33:53.130 --> 33:54.310
- [Olivia] Is that a duck?

33:54.310 --> 33:56.470
Oh no, the ice cream men
have caught up to us.

33:56.470 --> 33:57.540
How do they fly?

33:57.540 --> 33:59.390
If there's no mountains to jump off of?

33:59.390 --> 34:01.224
- [Jackson] They pull
us up by plane or truck.

34:01.224 --> 34:03.891
(ominous music)

34:10.240 --> 34:11.760
- Hey you kids, you want to fly?

34:11.760 --> 34:13.010
- Yeah, we need tandem flight, please.

34:13.010 --> 34:13.843
- All right, all right.

34:13.843 --> 34:14.676
That'll be $147.

34:15.660 --> 34:17.270
I can only get one of
you in the air at a time.

34:17.270 --> 34:19.310
You got that kind of scratch?

34:19.310 --> 34:20.160
- This should do.

34:20.160 --> 34:21.220
- Wow, look at that.

34:21.220 --> 34:22.580
Now we're talkin', now we're talkin'.

34:22.580 --> 34:24.880
Hang glider and pilot are
standin' by right over there.

34:24.880 --> 34:25.780
I gotta go to the bathroom.

34:25.780 --> 34:27.258
I'll be back in a couple of minutes,

34:27.258 --> 34:29.060
and we'll get you high in the sky.

34:29.060 --> 34:29.893
Gimme a second.

34:29.893 --> 34:30.726
I'll be right back.

34:30.726 --> 34:31.840
Y'all don't go nowhere, you hear?

34:31.840 --> 34:33.277
Get her done.

34:33.277 --> 34:34.110
(frantic music)

34:34.110 --> 34:35.360
- [Jackson] Follow me, I have an idea.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.110
- [Olivia] Are you sure about this?

34:38.533 --> 34:39.411

34:39.411 --> 34:40.661

34:58.375 --> 35:00.620
- Hey, how you doin', man?
- Hey.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.280
- How can I help you?

35:02.280 --> 35:03.690
- Did you see a couple of
kids come through here?

35:03.690 --> 35:04.850
- Yeah, I did.

35:04.850 --> 35:06.533
I think they went up that way.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.150
- You gotta get me up into the sky.

35:09.150 --> 35:11.017
- You're not gettin' high
in the sky today, sir.

35:11.017 --> 35:13.640
- Are you tryin' to say I'm too tall?

35:13.640 --> 35:15.730
- Are you sure this is a good idea?

35:15.730 --> 35:16.940
- Would you rather be kidnapped?

35:16.940 --> 35:18.250
- [Olivia] Point taken.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.310
- Yeah, you're too tall.

35:20.310 --> 35:21.260
That's it, yeah.

35:21.260 --> 35:22.120
- You believe this guy?

35:22.120 --> 35:23.880
He's tryin' to tell me
I'm too tall to fly?

35:23.880 --> 35:24.713
- Crazy.

35:24.713 --> 35:25.730
You're not even tall!

35:26.682 --> 35:27.515
- Well, get in the truck.

35:27.515 --> 35:28.350
We gotta go get 'em.

35:28.350 --> 35:29.559
Let's go get 'em.

35:29.559 --> 35:32.309
(dramatic music)

35:37.380 --> 35:38.890
- Are you sure you can fly this?

35:38.890 --> 35:39.993
- I can fly anything.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.050
Oh, snap, the ice cream men.

35:43.050 --> 35:43.883
We gotta go.

35:44.930 --> 35:46.890
- [Olivia] So how does this work?

35:46.890 --> 35:48.370
- [Jackson] That rope is
attached to the plane.

35:48.370 --> 35:49.330
It's gonna pull us into the air,

35:49.330 --> 35:51.278
where, hopefully, we'll find the clue.

35:51.278 --> 35:54.361
- Hey, kids, you can't go without me.

36:00.375 --> 36:01.958
- Full speed ahead!

36:03.776 --> 36:05.552
- Dagnabbit, not again.

36:05.552 --> 36:09.457
- Oh my gosh, we're not gonna make it!

36:09.457 --> 36:11.457
- [Jackson] Yes, we are!

36:15.281 --> 36:17.997
- [Chilly] Hey, you missed 'em.

36:17.997 --> 36:18.830
- Oh.

36:20.050 --> 36:23.095
- Wow, those kids can actually fly.

36:23.095 --> 36:25.970
(adventurous music)

36:25.970 --> 36:27.510
- [Olivia] This is awesome.

36:27.510 --> 36:30.080
We're actually flying.

36:30.080 --> 36:33.180
How are we going to find a
molecule with many warnings

36:33.180 --> 36:35.520
linked to global warming?

36:35.520 --> 36:40.153
- Wait, that looks like,
like, carbon dioxide?

36:41.200 --> 36:43.600
- [Boss] The clue must
be up there somewhere.

36:43.600 --> 36:44.753
You've gotta tow me up.

36:46.244 --> 36:48.080
- [Chilly] You sure about this?

36:48.080 --> 36:49.988
- [Boss] Don't question me, I'm the boss!

36:49.988 --> 36:51.238
- [Chilly] Yah!

36:52.680 --> 36:54.108
- All right, get the rope.

36:54.108 --> 36:55.320
All right, Chilly, we're
gonna use the truck

36:55.320 --> 36:56.772
to tow me up in the sky.

36:56.772 --> 37:00.360
(suspenseful music)

37:00.360 --> 37:01.333
Hey, hurry up!

37:02.260 --> 37:04.390
We're gonna fly high in the sky.

37:04.390 --> 37:07.150
I'm gonna take off quicker than a wrapper

37:07.150 --> 37:08.790
on a Huncha Muncha samich.

37:08.790 --> 37:12.320
I'm gonna be like the sorbet airways.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.023
- You're gonna fly high.

37:14.860 --> 37:16.330
All set, captain.

37:16.330 --> 37:18.640
Let's fly!

37:18.640 --> 37:19.853
He's so gonna die.

37:23.135 --> 37:25.096
- Kick it.

37:25.096 --> 37:25.929
Go.

37:32.213 --> 37:33.070
Oh!

37:33.070 --> 37:34.740
- [Jackson] Is that carbon dioxide?

37:34.740 --> 37:35.770
That's it!

37:35.770 --> 37:38.100
Let's disconnect and land this thing.

37:38.100 --> 37:41.100
(adventurous music)

37:54.144 --> 37:55.587
- Good landing.

37:55.587 --> 37:56.420
- [Boss] Hit it!

37:56.420 --> 37:57.837
- He thinks he's gonna fly.

37:57.837 --> 37:59.010
- Chilly, kick it!

37:59.010 --> 38:00.633
- [Chilly] He's probably gonna die!

38:02.665 --> 38:04.300
- Chilly, get me up in the air.

38:06.286 --> 38:08.473
Oh, shoot, the rope broke.

38:08.473 --> 38:09.538
Get the kids!

38:09.538 --> 38:12.310
- (laughing) Tough break, Boss!

38:12.310 --> 38:14.218
I'm gonna get the kids.

38:14.218 --> 38:16.599
(ice cream truck backfiring)

38:16.599 --> 38:19.349
(dramatic music)

38:23.718 --> 38:26.218
(light music)

38:34.290 --> 38:37.360
- Charcoal, carbon.

38:37.360 --> 38:41.790
- Tires, muffler, these are all car parts.

38:41.790 --> 38:42.923
- Catalytic converter?

38:44.300 --> 38:45.423
Carbon dioxide.

38:49.882 --> 38:51.482
- [Chilly] Huncha Muncha!

38:51.482 --> 38:54.232
(dramatic music)

39:00.285 --> 39:01.179
- Wow.
- Ooh.

39:01.179 --> 39:03.929
(wondrous music)

39:05.080 --> 39:06.800
- [Jackson] A Planet
Puzzler is part of a unique

39:06.800 --> 39:09.639
group of people who solves
the world's greatest problems?

39:09.639 --> 39:11.889
- [Olivia] Enter it, quick.

39:20.913 --> 39:23.663
(exciting music)

39:26.760 --> 39:28.330
- This next mystery's key lies

39:28.330 --> 39:30.810
in the theater of the sea,

39:30.810 --> 39:34.900
where there's a clash between
water, life and trash.

39:34.900 --> 39:35.930
Don't wait until later,

39:35.930 --> 39:37.770
there could be alligators.

39:37.770 --> 39:40.280
You'll need a skiff to
look under the cliff.

39:40.280 --> 39:42.520
But once you reach the end of the beach,

39:42.520 --> 39:45.496
listen and you'll hear
the cry of the Lorelei.

39:45.496 --> 39:48.246
(exciting music)

39:52.270 --> 39:53.623
- [Jackson] Let's get out of here.

39:56.392 --> 39:59.879
(frantic music)

39:59.879 --> 40:01.712
Ice cream men!
- Oh no.

40:05.093 --> 40:08.843
(ice cream truck backfiring)

40:11.574 --> 40:13.491
- [Jackson] Keep it up.

40:14.521 --> 40:16.130
- [Chilly] Hee yah!

40:16.130 --> 40:17.727
Direct hit.

40:17.727 --> 40:18.560
- I got you, Jackson.

40:18.560 --> 40:19.739
- Peekaboo!
- Ugh, ugh.

40:19.739 --> 40:20.788
- Got you.

40:20.788 --> 40:21.920
- [Olivia] Ha, take that!

40:21.920 --> 40:23.608
Ice cream to the face!

40:23.608 --> 40:24.441
(Chilly grunting)

40:24.441 --> 40:25.593
Come on, start, start start.

40:29.540 --> 40:31.557
- [Boss] Oh, hey, hey, what are you doin'?

40:31.557 --> 40:32.390
- No, no.
- Come here, you little brat.

40:32.390 --> 40:33.223
- [Olivia] Let go of me.

40:33.223 --> 40:35.137
Come on, no, let go of me.
- I got you now.

40:35.137 --> 40:36.200
- [Olivia] No, no.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.151
- Stop!
- Let go of me!

40:38.151 --> 40:39.653
Let go!
- Let me down.

40:39.653 --> 40:41.198
- Get in there.
- Let me down!

40:41.198 --> 40:44.031
(kids struggling)

40:46.490 --> 40:48.520
- Hey, I know you know where the clue is!

40:48.520 --> 40:50.330
Now cough it up!

40:50.330 --> 40:51.600
- We don't know anything.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.080
- It's in the Keys.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.250
- Hear that, Boss?

40:54.250 --> 40:56.050
We're goin' to the Keys.

40:56.050 --> 40:57.250
- What are you doing?

40:57.250 --> 40:58.670
- Getting us a ride to the Keys.

40:58.670 --> 41:00.010
- Oh, smart.

41:00.010 --> 41:02.350
- Now let's get rid of these little kids!

41:02.350 --> 41:04.620
- You'll never solve
the riddle on your own.

41:04.620 --> 41:05.500
- Ooh, burn.

41:05.500 --> 41:07.350
- We need them to solve the clue.

41:07.350 --> 41:10.740
You know, so we can find the
next token down in the Keys.

41:10.740 --> 41:12.800
(cell phone ringing)
- Check, Boss.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.380
- Answer the phone!

41:14.380 --> 41:15.213
- [Chilly] Untie 'em?

41:15.213 --> 41:16.823
- Or the dad's gonna call the cops!

41:17.983 --> 41:19.633
- You answer that phone.

41:22.520 --> 41:23.980
Where is it?

41:23.980 --> 41:25.897
- [Olivia] It's my dad!

41:27.180 --> 41:28.280
- [Brad] Hey, Olivia.

41:28.280 --> 41:29.753
- Uh, hi, Dad.

41:29.753 --> 41:31.600
- I finally got back
from my job interview.

41:31.600 --> 41:32.713
It took forever.

41:33.780 --> 41:36.211
But I wanted to tell you guys good night.

41:36.211 --> 41:37.786
(tinny ice cream truck music)

41:37.786 --> 41:39.108
What is that music?

41:39.108 --> 41:40.410
- [Olivia] What music?

41:40.410 --> 41:42.340
- Is everything okay?

41:42.340 --> 41:43.190
- [Olivia] We're having fun,

41:43.190 --> 41:45.260
and you don't need to worry about us.

41:45.260 --> 41:46.620
- You are with your mother, right?

41:46.620 --> 41:49.250
- Mom totally gave us permission

41:49.250 --> 41:50.790
to do this contest.

41:50.790 --> 41:51.623
- Contest?

41:51.623 --> 41:53.620
- We're, you know, following our hunch.

41:53.620 --> 41:55.350
- Following your hunch?

41:55.350 --> 41:56.410
I don't.

41:56.410 --> 41:58.400
- You know, like the ice cream?

41:58.400 --> 41:59.960
- What-
- Dad, we're totally fine.

41:59.960 --> 42:01.390
Don't worry about us.

42:01.390 --> 42:02.440
- Is Jackson with you?

42:02.440 --> 42:04.420
Let me talk to him.

42:04.420 --> 42:06.410
- Jackson's just kind of
tied up at the moment.

42:06.410 --> 42:07.820
You know, no big deal.

42:07.820 --> 42:09.299
Gotta go, Dad, bye!

42:09.299 --> 42:11.516
(worried music)

42:11.516 --> 42:12.349
- What?

42:15.643 --> 42:16.708
(tropical music)

42:16.708 --> 42:17.541
(phone buzzing)

42:17.541 --> 42:18.400
- Ugh!

42:18.400 --> 42:20.640
Who's calling me in Fiji?

42:20.640 --> 42:21.913
Oh, it's the schmuck!

42:23.630 --> 42:24.920
What?

42:24.920 --> 42:28.410
- You gave the kids
permission to do some contest?

42:28.410 --> 42:30.590
- Ugh, why would I be talking to the kids?

42:30.590 --> 42:32.930
I'm sitting on a beach in Fiji right now.

42:32.930 --> 42:34.283
- You are in Fiji?

42:35.690 --> 42:38.010
At the beach, in the middle of the night?

42:38.010 --> 42:41.083
- It's daytime here, you twit.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.600
- Triple whiskey on the rocks.

42:43.600 --> 42:44.630
- Thank you.

42:44.630 --> 42:47.224
- Fiji weegee, the spirit of spirits.

42:47.224 --> 42:48.360
- Thank you.

42:48.360 --> 42:49.870
- [Waiter] That'll be $57.25.

42:49.870 --> 42:51.254
- Go ahead and put
- No, the kids said

42:51.254 --> 42:52.420
- it on my room.
- that you stayed home

42:52.420 --> 42:54.540
because your stupid boyfriend was sick.

42:54.540 --> 42:56.174
- They tricked you again.

42:56.174 --> 42:58.007
You're so manipulable.

42:58.878 --> 43:00.530
- Manipulable.

43:00.530 --> 43:01.650
- Just find them!

43:01.650 --> 43:02.560
- How am I supposed to-

43:02.560 --> 43:04.270
- Hire a detective!

43:04.270 --> 43:06.420
- I'll find one first
thing in the morning.

43:10.510 --> 43:12.750
- You know, my parents were divorced,

43:12.750 --> 43:14.106
but I didn't even know it

43:14.106 --> 43:17.430
because they did this
thing called co-parenting,

43:17.430 --> 43:19.550
where they worked together to raise us

43:19.550 --> 43:23.210
despite their differences.

43:23.210 --> 43:24.790
- So you're saying I should probably

43:24.790 --> 43:26.310
go help the kids.

43:26.310 --> 43:29.050
- Hey, (tongue clicks)
that's a great idea.

43:29.050 --> 43:33.157
I will have them fuel up the jet.

43:33.157 --> 43:35.470
(Janet sighs)

43:35.470 --> 43:36.613
- Your card bounced.

43:37.748 --> 43:38.581
- Ugh.

43:38.581 --> 43:39.414
- Give it to the girl over there.

43:39.414 --> 43:40.680
I bet she could do it.

43:40.680 --> 43:42.330
She knows how to solve the clues.

43:43.866 --> 43:46.480
- I could crack it if I had the laptop.

43:46.480 --> 43:47.480
- Give her the computer!

43:47.480 --> 43:49.290
I wanna win this contest already!

43:49.290 --> 43:51.910
I can't spend all my
time lookin' for clues!

43:51.910 --> 43:54.040
We have ice cream to sell!

43:54.040 --> 43:55.647
(suspenseful music)

43:55.647 --> 43:59.340
- [Olivia] Cliff, Lorelei,
skiff, cry, alligator.

43:59.340 --> 44:00.263
I think I got it.

44:03.070 --> 44:03.903
- [Jackson] No, no, no, no, no.

44:03.903 --> 44:05.970
I know the exact Boolean search to do.

44:05.970 --> 44:06.803
Untie me.

44:06.803 --> 44:07.636
- Okay.

44:09.800 --> 44:10.793
If you say so.

44:20.659 --> 44:21.742
What are you?

44:22.890 --> 44:24.505
- [Jackson] Lorelei in
the Theater of the Sea.

44:24.505 --> 44:25.338
We went there on vacation.

44:25.338 --> 44:27.077
It's in the Keys.

44:27.077 --> 44:27.996
- [Olivia] What?

44:27.996 --> 44:29.610
- Just what I thought, Theater of the Sea.

44:29.610 --> 44:32.230
It has crocodiles, alligators, everything.

44:32.230 --> 44:33.780
It's at the Theater of the Sea.

44:34.678 --> 44:38.345
(ice cream truck backfires)

44:41.460 --> 44:44.220
- Okay, so what's the plan, Jacks?

44:44.220 --> 44:45.530
- Inside is a public place.

44:45.530 --> 44:46.640
They can't keep us tied up.

44:46.640 --> 44:48.320
We'll make a break for it on my cue.

44:48.320 --> 44:49.573
- Good plan.

44:49.573 --> 44:51.391
(Chilly and Boss laughing)

44:51.391 --> 44:53.370
- Now you're gonna show
us where the treasure is.

44:53.370 --> 44:54.630
Get over here.

44:54.630 --> 44:56.712
You better stay close.
- Get over here!

44:56.712 --> 44:58.453
- [Olivia] Let me go, hey.

44:58.453 --> 45:01.536
(apprehensive music)

45:02.650 --> 45:03.884
- Oh.

45:03.884 --> 45:04.717
Mm hmm.

45:06.320 --> 45:07.850
Welcome to Spy-Spot.

45:07.850 --> 45:09.050
I'm I-Spy.

45:09.050 --> 45:09.974
How can I help you?

45:09.974 --> 45:11.760
- Are you a detective?

45:11.760 --> 45:12.710
- I'm a spy.

45:12.710 --> 45:13.543
- Whatever.

45:13.543 --> 45:14.550
My kids are missing.

45:14.550 --> 45:16.291
- You lost your kids?

45:16.291 --> 45:18.080
Did you call the cops?

45:18.080 --> 45:18.913
- Yes.

45:18.913 --> 45:21.060
They won't do anything for 48 hours.

45:21.060 --> 45:22.440
Can you find them?

45:22.440 --> 45:24.120
- I-Spy can try.

45:24.120 --> 45:25.900
- What's your real name?

45:25.900 --> 45:29.050
- I-Spy, I had it changed
for business purposes.

45:29.050 --> 45:32.530
So do you have any idea
where your kids could be?

45:32.530 --> 45:34.210
- All I know is they said something

45:34.210 --> 45:37.327
about follow your hunch.

45:37.327 --> 45:38.994
- Follow your hunch.

45:40.010 --> 45:42.450
Oh, the contest, right.

45:42.450 --> 45:44.160
Where you can win a million dollars?

45:44.160 --> 45:45.270
Awesome.

45:45.270 --> 45:49.450
So I'll just get into the contest website.

45:49.450 --> 45:53.120
But first, I'm just gonna need you to sign

45:54.600 --> 45:57.870
here, here, here, here.

45:57.870 --> 45:59.000
That's how much it's gonna be,

45:59.000 --> 46:00.030
which shouldn't be a problem

46:00.030 --> 46:01.943
if your kids win the contest.

46:01.943 --> 46:04.290
- Oh ho, we got you kids.
- Let go.

46:04.290 --> 46:06.383
- You're not gettin' away now.

46:06.383 --> 46:07.744
(dolphin squeaking)

46:07.744 --> 46:09.319
(ominous music)

46:09.319 --> 46:10.551
(men struggling)

46:10.551 --> 46:11.668
- [Jackson] Now, Olivia.

46:11.668 --> 46:12.501
- Let 'em go.

46:12.501 --> 46:15.150
- [Olivia] So where are we going?

46:15.150 --> 46:15.983
- [Boss] Uh, let 'em go.

46:15.983 --> 46:17.040
We know where the clue is.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.383
By the alligator exhibit.

46:19.220 --> 46:20.513
- [Jackson] The alligator exhibit.

46:23.264 --> 46:24.597
- [Olivia] What?

46:25.559 --> 46:28.309
(dramatic music)

46:30.517 --> 46:31.647
- [Boss] Uh, don't worry about it.

46:31.647 --> 46:34.800
I know where it is.
- It's an easy contest, Boss.

46:34.800 --> 46:36.650
- Hurry, they're coming.
- Let's go.

46:38.638 --> 46:39.970
- Hey look, I see something over there.

46:39.970 --> 46:40.803
- There it is!

46:40.803 --> 46:41.834
- It's a clue.
- Get it.

46:41.834 --> 46:43.017
What's it say?
- It's a paper.

46:43.017 --> 46:43.940
Let me see what it says.

46:43.940 --> 46:44.773
Ugh.

46:48.200 --> 46:51.190
You two are idiots!

46:51.190 --> 46:52.023
- Idiots?

46:52.023 --> 46:53.580
Have you seen any idiots?

46:53.580 --> 46:56.010
- Yeah, you're the idiot.

46:56.010 --> 46:56.843
- Great!

46:56.843 --> 46:58.890
Maybe I have the clue.

46:58.890 --> 47:00.760
Check my pockets.

47:00.760 --> 47:02.913
Nope, still nothin', Boss.

47:02.913 --> 47:03.746
- Uh uh.

47:05.351 --> 47:06.184
Let's get outta here.

47:06.184 --> 47:07.060
Let's go find these kids.

47:07.060 --> 47:07.950
- Got it!

47:07.950 --> 47:10.086
- [Olivia] Which way to the Lorelei?

47:10.086 --> 47:12.836
(dramatic music)

47:14.520 --> 47:15.353
- It's close.

47:19.121 --> 47:20.660
We need to get to the beach.

47:20.660 --> 47:21.493
- They're closed.

47:21.493 --> 47:22.420
You'll have to get there by sea.

47:22.420 --> 47:23.670
- We'll take a boat then.

47:24.636 --> 47:26.286
- I don't rent boats to children.

47:29.543 --> 47:30.990
- [Jackson] I have an idea.

47:30.990 --> 47:32.250
- All right, we're gonna
go find these kids now.

47:32.250 --> 47:33.640
- Check the computer, Boss,

47:33.640 --> 47:35.210
and see what these kids were lookin' at.

47:35.210 --> 47:36.943
- Ah, let's see what we got here.

47:38.215 --> 47:40.965
(Olivia humming)

47:43.100 --> 47:44.010
- Hi, we'd like a boat.

47:44.010 --> 47:46.010
- Aye, a boat.

47:46.010 --> 47:47.733
Clearly, you're over 18.

47:48.580 --> 47:51.940
We need a signature and a
driver's license number.

47:51.940 --> 47:54.330
- Yes, yes, that's how
we got here, by car.

47:54.330 --> 47:55.163
- [Man] By car?

47:55.163 --> 47:56.840
Then you'll like the Cadillac boat.

47:57.910 --> 47:58.743
- There.

47:58.743 --> 48:00.772
They're at the Lorelei Restaurant.

48:00.772 --> 48:02.499
- Lorelei, got it, Boss.
- Lorelei, there it is.

48:02.499 --> 48:03.332
I got it.

48:03.332 --> 48:04.180
I got it right on here.

48:04.180 --> 48:05.013
Here it is.

48:08.175 --> 48:10.534
("The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin)

48:10.534 --> 48:12.659
(ice cream truck backfiring)

48:12.659 --> 48:15.409
(dramatic music)

48:18.370 --> 48:20.227
- [Jackson] We'll take the
Cadillac around to the beach.

48:20.227 --> 48:22.090
(ice cream truck backfiring)

48:22.090 --> 48:24.110
- [Olivia] Can you drive this?

48:24.110 --> 48:25.673
- [Jackson] I can drive anything.

48:26.509 --> 48:27.613
- [Olivia] Are we unhooked?

48:28.640 --> 48:29.540
- Hey, did you see a couple of kids

48:29.540 --> 48:30.823
come by here to rent a boat?

48:30.823 --> 48:32.620
- [Man] I don't rent boats to children!

48:32.620 --> 48:34.053
But they went that way.

48:35.375 --> 48:36.208
- Go get 'em.

48:36.208 --> 48:37.041
Let's go get 'em.

48:37.041 --> 48:38.490
Go get 'em.

48:38.490 --> 48:40.320
- If we don't hurry up,
- Look, there they go!

48:40.320 --> 48:42.354
- [Chilly] we'll never
get those kids, Iceman.

48:42.354 --> 48:44.070
- They're right over there, Chilly.

48:44.070 --> 48:47.573
- [Chilly] Let's be real pirates,
Boss, and take this boat.

48:48.560 --> 48:50.340
- [Boss] There's a lotta
steps here, you know.

48:50.340 --> 48:51.390
The boat's creakin'.

48:51.390 --> 48:52.900
The bows are gonna break.

48:52.900 --> 48:55.050
- [Chilly] Maybe you're
too tall for this boat.

48:55.050 --> 48:56.200
- I see 'em over there.

48:58.771 --> 49:01.181
(dramatic music)

49:01.181 --> 49:02.680
- [Chilly] Fire in the hole!

49:02.680 --> 49:04.660
- This whole boat is made out of plastic.

49:04.660 --> 49:05.498
It's not even real.

49:05.498 --> 49:06.331
Look, look, look!

49:06.331 --> 49:07.164
They're goin' slow.

49:07.164 --> 49:08.902
I think we can catch 'em.

49:08.902 --> 49:10.220
(slow jazz music)

49:10.220 --> 49:12.020
- Do you have your kids' email addresses?

49:12.020 --> 49:16.400
- Yeah, um, that and
some other stuff there.

49:16.400 --> 49:17.600
- [I-Spy] Okay.

49:17.600 --> 49:19.321
- [Olivia] Is this as fast as it goes?

49:19.321 --> 49:20.154
(dramatic music)

49:20.154 --> 49:21.780
- This thing sure is slow!

49:21.780 --> 49:24.770
It's like we're movin' backwards, Boss.

49:24.770 --> 49:26.600
- Both boats are slower than molasses!

49:26.600 --> 49:28.070
We're never gonna get these kids.

49:28.070 --> 49:30.611
Go down below and find
something now, will ya?

49:30.611 --> 49:31.444
They're gonna get away!

49:31.444 --> 49:32.610
- Got it, Boss.

49:32.610 --> 49:33.670
- [Olivia] Where is the beach?

49:33.670 --> 49:34.503
- [Jackson] According to the map,

49:34.503 --> 49:35.410
it's right around the corner.

49:35.410 --> 49:37.890
- So much junk down here.

49:37.890 --> 49:39.450
Think I found somethin', Boss!

49:39.450 --> 49:40.670
- [Iceman] Come on, let's go.

49:40.670 --> 49:42.376
We gotta stop these kids.

49:42.376 --> 49:45.650
(Chilly laughing)

49:45.650 --> 49:47.870
- Lookit what I got, Boss!

49:47.870 --> 49:49.480
This'll stop 'em.

49:49.480 --> 49:52.330
- Is there anything they've
been doing this summer?

49:52.330 --> 49:55.355
- Olivia likes unicorns.

49:55.355 --> 49:56.350
Ugh.

49:56.350 --> 49:58.423
Mermaids, uh.

49:59.287 --> 50:01.830
"Should, Could and Would."

50:01.830 --> 50:02.784
Um.

50:02.784 --> 50:04.180
(slow jazz music)

50:04.180 --> 50:05.780
- Maybe something more personal?

50:06.807 --> 50:07.640
- This is outrageous!

50:07.640 --> 50:08.963
This is just.

50:10.065 --> 50:11.902
Do me a favor, just get the harpoon,

50:11.902 --> 50:13.050
and let's shoot these guys already.

50:13.050 --> 50:13.890
Please!

50:13.890 --> 50:14.723
Look at this thing.

50:14.723 --> 50:16.046
I look like a joke!

50:16.046 --> 50:18.796
(dramatic music)

50:20.387 --> 50:22.637
All right, Chilly, line
'em up nice and easy.

50:23.543 --> 50:24.945
Shoot 'em!

50:24.945 --> 50:26.445
Shoot 'em already!

50:28.372 --> 50:30.574
(both laughing)

50:30.574 --> 50:31.470
We got 'em.
- Got 'em!

50:31.470 --> 50:32.539
- We're hit.

50:32.539 --> 50:33.972
- Yes, yes!
- Yeah!

50:33.972 --> 50:36.472
(light music)

50:37.343 --> 50:39.410
- [Olivia] Man, that was a perfect shot.

50:39.410 --> 50:41.330
So much smoke and oil.

50:41.330 --> 50:42.700
It's spraying all over the place.

50:42.700 --> 50:44.400
- [Jackson] I can still get us to shore.

50:44.400 --> 50:46.453
- Victory is ours. (laughs)

50:46.453 --> 50:47.993
- We got you kids!

50:48.950 --> 50:50.944
Looks kinda shallow there, Boss.

50:50.944 --> 50:53.469
- [Iceman] (laughing) It's too shallow

50:53.469 --> 50:54.302
where they're heading.

50:54.302 --> 50:55.900
- [Chilly] What's the draft on this boat?

50:55.900 --> 50:56.960
- [Iceman] We have to
double back to the dock.

50:56.960 --> 50:59.030
- [Chilly] See what I see?

50:59.030 --> 51:01.070
They're there, we gotta go there.

51:01.070 --> 51:03.323
- [Iceman] Those kids are
headed to that beach cove.

51:04.360 --> 51:05.193
- [Jackson] Lorelei Cove.

51:05.193 --> 51:07.126
According to the map, it's
too shallow for their boat.

51:07.126 --> 51:08.426
They'll have to go around.

51:11.046 --> 51:13.463
(airy music)

51:18.260 --> 51:19.320
- [Olivia] Where do you think the clue is?

51:19.320 --> 51:20.450
- [Jackson] This is the end of the beach.

51:20.450 --> 51:21.710
The clue has to be here somewhere.

51:21.710 --> 51:24.143
- [Olivia] And what is
that creepy singing?

51:25.050 --> 51:27.010
And what's a skiff?

51:27.010 --> 51:28.730
- I don't know, a boat maybe?

51:28.730 --> 51:30.570
- [Olivia] We're at the end of the beach.

51:30.570 --> 51:32.150
Why does everything smell?

51:32.150 --> 51:33.620
I don't see a cliff.

51:33.620 --> 51:35.540
There's no rocks or anything.

51:35.540 --> 51:36.470
This is Florida.

51:36.470 --> 51:38.300
We don't have mountains.

51:38.300 --> 51:40.600
All we have is trash mountains.

51:40.600 --> 51:42.057
- Mermaids, uh.

51:44.270 --> 51:46.801
- There's no cliffs anywhere!

51:46.801 --> 51:49.253
- (sighs) Let's just sit
here and be sad about life.

51:52.800 --> 51:54.170
What are we doing?

51:54.170 --> 51:55.003
- I know.

51:55.003 --> 51:56.260
We're so far from home.

51:56.260 --> 51:58.220
Well, at least we're on an adventure.

51:58.220 --> 51:59.710
- A terrible adventure!

51:59.710 --> 52:01.483
- Terribly awesome!

52:02.400 --> 52:04.730
I mean, like, it's all
about the perspective.

52:04.730 --> 52:06.530
Who else gets to go on an adventure?

52:10.680 --> 52:12.137
- This is so stupid!

52:14.774 --> 52:16.703
(illuminating music)

52:16.703 --> 52:18.090
Liv, get up.

52:18.090 --> 52:18.923
Get up.

52:18.923 --> 52:20.525
Come on, get up.

52:20.525 --> 52:21.630
Cliff's skiff.

52:21.630 --> 52:23.280
Skiff is another name for a boat.

52:25.080 --> 52:26.247
- Under the cliff.

52:28.906 --> 52:32.073
(investigating music)

52:36.010 --> 52:37.580
There's something here.

52:37.580 --> 52:38.893
- [Jackson] Can you get it?

52:44.875 --> 52:45.710
(Olivia gasps)

52:45.710 --> 52:47.230
(wondrous music)

52:47.230 --> 52:48.530
- [Olivia] A coin, a clue.

52:54.300 --> 52:56.066
- [Jackson] We're in.

52:56.066 --> 52:58.816
(exciting music)

53:02.080 --> 53:04.760
- I must say, I am thoroughly impressed.

53:04.760 --> 53:07.370
I had my doubts that anyone
could make it this far,

53:07.370 --> 53:09.557
but yet, here you are.

53:09.557 --> 53:11.530
So let's get down to it, shall we?

53:11.530 --> 53:13.650
We've discussed the air and the sea,

53:13.650 --> 53:15.390
but at hand is the land,

53:15.390 --> 53:18.260
where we shall solve the biggest mystery.

53:18.260 --> 53:20.890
You must find a marker of the sea.

53:20.890 --> 53:23.510
The key is where the three come to be

53:23.510 --> 53:26.994
at a point established in 1983.

53:26.994 --> 53:29.470
(exciting music)

53:29.470 --> 53:32.030
- [Olivia] Mom's always
said she was born in 1983

53:32.030 --> 53:34.123
at the Southernmost Point in Key West.

53:35.889 --> 53:38.500
Excuse me, do you know how
we can get to Key West?

53:38.500 --> 53:40.770
- [Woman] Yeah, you can
take Wild Bill's Biplanes.

53:40.770 --> 53:42.591
- [Olivia] Thank you.

53:42.591 --> 53:43.424
(slow jazz music)

53:43.424 --> 53:44.510
- Action, not inaction.

53:44.510 --> 53:45.343
We're in!

53:46.410 --> 53:49.670
So here I can actually
see the last location

53:49.670 --> 53:51.470
they were, the last clue they found,

53:51.470 --> 53:53.080
and it looks like that was Islamorada.

53:53.080 --> 53:54.538
- [Brad] Wow, that's great.

53:54.538 --> 53:55.890
(exciting music)

53:55.890 --> 53:57.470
- What pilot is going to let

53:57.470 --> 54:00.800
two alone kids fly on his plane?

54:00.800 --> 54:04.350
What kind of crazy, insane,
ludicrous pilot would do that?

54:04.350 --> 54:06.810
- Nothing is going to stop us.

54:06.810 --> 54:09.423
Here, take my phone and call Biplane Bill.

54:10.840 --> 54:11.930
- Here's the phone number.

54:11.930 --> 54:13.480
Got it.

54:13.480 --> 54:14.845
- [Bill] Conch Republic Air Force Tours,

54:14.845 --> 54:15.678
this is Biplane Bill.

54:15.678 --> 54:17.067
- Hello.
- Howdy, ma'am.

54:17.067 --> 54:20.350
- My two kids have been
dying to see their dad

54:20.350 --> 54:22.980
near the Southernmost Point.
- Yes, ma'am, I understand.

54:22.980 --> 54:23.947
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, how can I help you?

54:23.947 --> 54:27.560
- You fly from Islamorada
to Key West, don't you?

54:27.560 --> 54:28.550
- [Bill] Twice a day,

54:28.550 --> 54:29.553
but for two kids, you'll have to sign

54:29.553 --> 54:30.521
that online waiver form.

54:30.521 --> 54:31.354
- What?

54:31.354 --> 54:34.069
I have to sign the online waiver?

54:34.069 --> 54:34.902
- [Bill] Yes, ma'am,

54:34.902 --> 54:36.860
everybody under 18
- If I must.

54:36.860 --> 54:39.611
I guess I'll have to go the extra mile.

54:39.611 --> 54:41.190
- [Bill] Well now, ma'am,
it's not really an extra mile.

54:41.190 --> 54:42.023
It's on the internet.

54:42.023 --> 54:43.010
You can just sign it right there

54:43.010 --> 54:45.180
on the phone or any kind of tablet.

54:45.180 --> 54:46.251
- Excuse me.

54:46.251 --> 54:48.370
You seen these two little
kids runnin' around here?

54:48.370 --> 54:50.673
- Yeah, they went to Wild Bill's Biplanes.

54:50.673 --> 54:51.898
- Two kids?
- Back that way?

54:51.898 --> 54:53.120
- Two.
- Two kids, back that way.

54:53.120 --> 54:53.953
- Which way?

54:53.953 --> 54:55.287
- All right.
- That way.

54:55.287 --> 54:56.120
- Right here?

54:56.120 --> 54:57.760
- That's it.
- Let's go, Boss.

54:57.760 --> 55:00.070
- Okay, I think I got us signed up.

55:00.070 --> 55:01.630
It should be right over there.

55:01.630 --> 55:02.700
- [Jackson] Let's go!

55:02.700 --> 55:04.468
Play the dramatic music.

55:04.468 --> 55:07.218
(dramatic music)

55:08.753 --> 55:10.170
(slow jazz music)

55:10.170 --> 55:13.850
- So the Southernmost Point
was established in 1983.

55:13.850 --> 55:15.393
- By land, air and sea.

55:17.040 --> 55:18.900
Let's go, Key West.

55:18.900 --> 55:20.210
- We'll never make it down there.

55:20.210 --> 55:21.523
The traffic's really bad.

55:26.085 --> 55:28.502
(Brad sighs)

55:30.760 --> 55:32.123
- How about by jet-ski?

55:33.685 --> 55:38.595
- Mm hmm. (chuckles)

55:38.595 --> 55:41.345
(dramatic music)

55:48.198 --> 55:50.865
(frantic music)

55:54.700 --> 55:55.533
- Hey, kids.

55:55.533 --> 55:57.880
Welcome to the Conch
Republic Air Force Tours.

55:57.880 --> 55:59.040
How can I help you today?

55:59.040 --> 56:00.820
- We needed a tour to Key West.

56:00.820 --> 56:03.060
- We go from Islamorada down to Key West.

56:03.060 --> 56:05.230
You guys got $200?

56:05.230 --> 56:07.580
It's $200 per person.

56:07.580 --> 56:10.002
Did your parents sign that online waiver?

56:10.002 --> 56:11.400
- Yes.

56:11.400 --> 56:13.940
- Two kids, I got a call about it too.

56:13.940 --> 56:14.773
One to.

56:14.773 --> 56:16.312
Oh look, kids, ice cream!

56:16.312 --> 56:18.007
- What?
- I'll tell you what,

56:18.007 --> 56:19.220
y'all want some Huncha Munchas?

56:19.220 --> 56:21.370
I'm gonna go get you some
Huncha Munchas for your ride.

56:21.370 --> 56:23.000
How's that sound?

56:23.000 --> 56:25.623
All right, y'all go get
loaded up in the front seat.

56:26.938 --> 56:28.305
(dramatic music)

56:28.305 --> 56:32.573
- [Olivia] I guess
somebody's had their coffee.

56:32.573 --> 56:35.120
- Hey, I need two of them Huncha Munchas.

56:35.120 --> 56:36.313
- Why not three?

56:37.200 --> 56:39.000
- Have you seen a coupla
kids come by here?

56:39.000 --> 56:40.680
- Yeah, they're in the plane right now.

56:40.680 --> 56:41.980
- Chilly, see if you can get us a plane

56:41.980 --> 56:42.813
to get us up there.

56:42.813 --> 56:43.740
- Can we get a plane to get up there

56:43.740 --> 56:45.470
with those dirty faced kids?

56:45.470 --> 56:47.370
- No, I only got the one.

56:47.370 --> 56:48.973
Be back in a few hours.

56:48.973 --> 56:51.863
Kids said somethin'
about Southernmost Point.

56:53.580 --> 56:54.510
- [Iceman] Chilly, you drive.

56:54.510 --> 56:56.100
I have an idea.

56:56.100 --> 56:57.510
- [Bill] Thanks.

56:57.510 --> 56:59.900
- Have a Huncha Muncha day!

56:59.900 --> 57:01.863
- Lemme get my flight hat, and we'll go.

57:03.250 --> 57:04.821
Okay.

57:04.821 --> 57:06.820
- [Chilly] Huncha Muncha!

57:06.820 --> 57:09.570
(dramatic music)

57:12.180 --> 57:13.643
- Hey, wait up!

57:13.643 --> 57:14.476
Hello?

57:14.476 --> 57:16.590
Where do you think you're going?

57:16.590 --> 57:18.090
Stop walking away from me!

57:18.090 --> 57:19.980
I found out where they are.

57:19.980 --> 57:21.930
- Well, you're not coming with me.

57:21.930 --> 57:23.660
- Well, the deposit's nonrefundable,

57:23.660 --> 57:25.060
and you still owe me the remainder.

57:25.060 --> 57:25.893
- Uh uh.

57:27.290 --> 57:28.690
No, you're not.

57:28.690 --> 57:29.960
Hey, how you doin'?

57:29.960 --> 57:31.110
How fast do these things go?

57:31.110 --> 57:32.683
- Well, 60 miles an hour.

57:33.620 --> 57:35.770
- I could be in Key West in an hour.

57:35.770 --> 57:37.010
Okay, and how much?

57:37.010 --> 57:38.170
- [Man] 100 bucks.

57:38.170 --> 57:39.150
- Okay, I'll take it.

57:39.150 --> 57:39.983
- [Man] All right, all you have to do

57:39.983 --> 57:41.270
is sign here, sign here,

57:41.270 --> 57:42.730
sign here, sign here, sign here.

57:42.730 --> 57:44.100
Initial here, sign here,

57:44.100 --> 57:45.203
sign here, sign here.

57:47.130 --> 57:48.450
- [Chilly] How we lookin', Boss?

57:48.450 --> 57:50.550
- Those kids will be flying right over us.

57:51.760 --> 57:53.090
The runway is right there.

57:53.090 --> 57:53.923
- Hmm.

57:53.923 --> 57:54.879
- Do you see it?

57:54.879 --> 57:55.712
- Mm hmm.

57:55.712 --> 57:56.545
- We're gonna get those kids,

57:56.545 --> 57:58.050
shoot them out of the sky.

57:58.050 --> 58:00.270
- How am I gonna do that, Boss?

58:00.270 --> 58:01.470
- Do you remember when I told you

58:01.470 --> 58:04.310
that I, ha, ha, modified it?

58:04.310 --> 58:05.400
- Yeah.

58:05.400 --> 58:06.830
- Shoot 'em down, get 'em!

58:06.830 --> 58:08.740
- [Chilly] To the roof.

58:08.740 --> 58:11.490
(dramatic music)

58:19.280 --> 58:21.140
- All right, Chilly, I'm loading up

58:21.140 --> 58:23.421
the Huncha Muncha launcher,

58:23.421 --> 58:24.254
and you're gonna knock those kids

58:24.254 --> 58:25.873
right out of the sky.

58:30.803 --> 58:31.636
- Ha!

58:32.519 --> 58:33.352
Oh ho!

58:42.942 --> 58:43.775
Hmm.

58:56.670 --> 58:58.993
We're gonna need more power, Boss!

58:59.920 --> 59:02.414
- [Iceman] Okay, I'm gonna
give you all she's got.

59:02.414 --> 59:04.129
More power comin' up.

59:04.129 --> 59:07.129
(adventurous music)

59:12.301 --> 59:13.490
- We gotta get out of here, fast.

59:13.490 --> 59:15.053
- Let's go, Biplane Bill.

59:21.820 --> 59:23.572
- [Bill] All right, kids,
hold onto your hats.

59:23.572 --> 59:26.239
Here we go, cleared for takeoff.

59:27.089 --> 59:31.089
- Full speed ahead.
- This is actually not speed.

59:34.094 --> 59:36.344
This is actually not speed.

59:49.009 --> 59:52.960
- Shoop, and another one. (chuckles)

59:52.960 --> 59:55.857
Here, okay, locked and loaded, Chilly.

59:55.857 --> 59:58.607

1:00:04.077 --> 1:00:07.114
There's some Huncha Muncha
samiches flyin' by us.

1:00:07.114 --> 1:00:09.937
- Yah, yah, yah!
- Stand by for evasive flying.

1:00:09.937 --> 1:00:11.693
Not my first rodeo.

1:00:11.693 --> 1:00:14.054

- [Bill] We're in clear air, kids.

1:00:29.617 --> 1:00:31.970

ride down to Key West.

1:03:20.111 --> 1:03:20.944
Hey.
- Hey.

1:03:20.944 --> 1:03:23.180
- I told you nobody could solve it,

1:03:23.180 --> 1:03:25.837
especially a dumb girl like you.

1:03:25.837 --> 1:03:27.897

1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:49.174

kind of suspicious.

1:03:50.405 --> 1:03:53.155

1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:00.670
land, air and sea.

1:04:28.924 --> 1:04:30.630
- [Iceman] Uh, these kids
are just wastin' their time.

1:04:30.630 --> 1:04:33.138
Look at this, they're playin' with a ball.

1:04:33.138 --> 1:04:33.971
- [Chilly] They're trash collectors.

1:04:33.971 --> 1:04:37.004
- Hurry up, Jackson.
- Trash collectors, Boss.

1:04:37.004 --> 1:04:38.660
- Let's go.
- Kids are dumb.

1:04:38.660 --> 1:04:39.760
- Are you guys okay?

1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:41.570
- Dad, how did you find us?

1:04:41.570 --> 1:04:42.450
- He didn't.

1:04:42.450 --> 1:04:43.450
I found you.

1:04:43.450 --> 1:04:45.990
Another case solved, 100%.

- Uh, Spy, I-Spy.

1:04:49.670 --> 1:04:50.980
- Who are these guys?

1:04:50.980 --> 1:04:53.534
- Remember the ice cream men?

1:04:53.534 --> 1:04:54.530
- Did they hurt you?

1:04:54.530 --> 1:04:55.897
- Nah, they just kidnapped us.

1:04:55.897 --> 1:04:58.080
But we could've gotten away at any point.

1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:00.000
They're too stupid.

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:01.060
- We let them kidnap us

1:05:01.060 --> 1:05:03.020
so we could get down to
the Southernmost Point.

1:05:03.020 --> 1:05:04.700
It's like reverse psychology.

1:05:04.700 --> 1:05:07.306
- You hitchhiked with kidnappers?

1:05:07.306 --> 1:05:08.190
- Epic!

1:05:08.190 --> 1:05:09.630
Nice move, kids.

1:05:09.630 --> 1:05:11.753
- What is wrong with you?

1:05:11.753 --> 1:05:12.771
- Ugh.

1:05:12.771 --> 1:05:15.680
- Looks like it's back to
livin' the dream, huh, Boss?

1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:17.798
- Yeah well, those kids look real happy.

1:05:17.798 --> 1:05:18.631
- Hmm.

1:05:18.631 --> 1:05:19.760
(funny music)

1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:22.060
- [I-Spy] Hey, hey, you
still owe me a balance.

1:05:22.060 --> 1:05:23.110
- You didn't do anything.

1:05:23.110 --> 1:05:24.452
I did all the work.

1:05:24.452 --> 1:05:25.285
- [I-Spy] What do you mean?

1:05:25.285 --> 1:05:26.560
I got us all the way here.

1:05:26.560 --> 1:05:28.650
- [Brad] I didn't even want you to come.

1:05:28.650 --> 1:05:29.483
- [I-Spy] Which reminds me,

1:05:29.483 --> 1:05:31.796
do you have a way to get us back?

1:05:31.796 --> 1:05:34.137
- [Brad] (sighs) We'll have to get a car.

1:05:34.137 --> 1:05:35.970
It's gonna cost a fortune.

1:05:35.970 --> 1:05:37.670
- [Olivia] Let's take the jet-ski home.

1:05:37.670 --> 1:05:38.690
- [Brad] No, honey.

1:05:38.690 --> 1:05:41.240
We can't all fit on the jet-ski.

1:05:41.240 --> 1:05:42.760
I can't believe you guys.

1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:44.370
What were you thinking?

1:05:44.370 --> 1:05:46.290
- [Jackson] We were tryin' to
win a million dollars, Dad,

1:05:46.290 --> 1:05:47.620
and save the whole world

1:05:47.620 --> 1:05:49.753

1:05:53.150 --> 1:05:55.120
Those kids look suspicious.

1:05:55.120 --> 1:05:56.850
I think it's a good idea

1:05:56.850 --> 1:05:58.153
we go stake out the house.

1:05:59.090 --> 1:06:00.243
- A stakeout?

(light bouncy music)

1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:14.054
- [Jackson] Dad, do we
have to take a shower?

1:06:14.054 --> 1:06:15.790
- Ugh, it's fine.

1:06:15.790 --> 1:06:17.540
We'll just clean up in the morning.

1:06:19.860 --> 1:06:23.063
I can't believe we, we made it.

1:06:24.060 --> 1:06:25.303
We're, we're home.

1:06:29.134 --> 1:06:29.967
Ah.

1:06:32.504 --> 1:06:33.337
Ah.

1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:45.630
Well, that was some terrible adventure

1:06:45.630 --> 1:06:48.100
you two were on.
- Nah, it was awesome.

1:06:48.100 --> 1:06:50.420
Well, I could say it was
a terrible adventure,

1:06:50.420 --> 1:06:52.331
but, the truth is, we had a blast.

1:06:52.331 --> 1:06:53.164
- Really?

1:06:53.164 --> 1:06:54.670
- And, plus, we were doing it for you.

1:06:54.670 --> 1:06:55.860
- [Brad] What do you mean?

1:06:55.860 --> 1:06:57.500
- If we could've solved the puzzle,

1:06:57.500 --> 1:07:01.649
we could've won one
million dollars and a job.

1:07:01.649 --> 1:07:02.620
- Oh, that's sweet, honey,

1:07:02.620 --> 1:07:05.040
but I'm pretty sure you
have to be an adult.

1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:07.610
- They presume it'll be an adult, I think,

1:07:07.610 --> 1:07:09.500
but I read the terms of services.

1:07:09.500 --> 1:07:11.360
It doesn't specify any age.

1:07:11.360 --> 1:07:14.300
Either way, they're
selling it on ice cream!

1:07:14.300 --> 1:07:15.830
- I don't want you guys
to worry about that.

1:07:15.830 --> 1:07:17.480
We're gonna figure something out.

1:07:26.360 --> 1:07:29.089
All right, kid, time to get some sleep.

1:07:29.089 --> 1:07:31.100
- (sighs) We were so close.

1:07:31.100 --> 1:07:32.273
We almost won.

1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:36.010
- Yeah, well, you need to be home

1:07:36.930 --> 1:07:40.593
on electronics, doing
nothing like a normal kid.

1:07:41.940 --> 1:07:43.052
- Okay.

1:07:43.052 --> 1:07:45.953
- (sighs) I'm sure it goes without saying,

1:07:47.130 --> 1:07:48.820
but you better never,

1:07:48.820 --> 1:07:53.463
ever, ever do anything
like that ever again.

1:07:54.950 --> 1:07:59.950
- [Jackson] Okay.

1:08:00.348 --> 1:08:02.931
(sneaky music)

1:08:18.972 --> 1:08:20.924
(wondrous music)

1:08:20.924 --> 1:08:21.924
Whoa, a key.

1:08:25.804 --> 1:08:28.471
(magical music)

1:08:37.737 --> 1:08:40.487
(exciting music)

1:08:46.223 --> 1:08:47.616
("The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin)

1:08:47.616 --> 1:08:49.510
- I'm gonna pull up around
the corner over here.

1:08:49.510 --> 1:08:50.420
See the spot?

1:08:50.420 --> 1:08:52.660
That's where we're gonna
go do the stakeout.

1:08:52.660 --> 1:08:53.690
- Steak?

1:08:53.690 --> 1:08:55.340
I love steak!

1:08:55.340 --> 1:08:57.070
- I'm not talkin' about food!

1:08:57.070 --> 1:08:59.390
I'm talkin' about watchin'
the house with the kids!

1:08:59.390 --> 1:09:00.963
You keep talking about steak!

1:09:03.175 --> 1:09:04.008
(Chilly laughing)

1:09:04.008 --> 1:09:07.023
I can't believe that you got
a delivery this time of day!

1:09:07.950 --> 1:09:10.670
- Well, you said it was a stakeout, Boss!

1:09:10.670 --> 1:09:12.350
This is steak,

1:09:12.350 --> 1:09:13.483
and we're out!

1:09:14.627 --> 1:09:16.860
- Ugh.
- Speaking of big ideas.

1:09:16.860 --> 1:09:19.530
I have an idea for a Huncha Muncha dance.

1:09:19.530 --> 1:09:20.470

Liv, Liv, I just entered it.

1:09:43.234 --> 1:09:44.580

1:09:44.580 --> 1:09:45.413
Liv!

1:09:54.526 --> 1:09:55.976
- The Castillo de San Marcos?

1:09:57.373 --> 1:09:58.843
- [Jackson] There's a train leaving soon.

1:09:59.958 --> 1:10:00.791
- [Olivia] Play it.

1:10:00.791 --> 1:10:01.901
Let's check it out.

1:10:01.901 --> 1:10:02.734

of the land, air and sea.

1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:08.450
Now there is just one more puzzle

1:10:08.450 --> 1:10:10.630
for which you must find the key.

1:10:10.630 --> 1:10:14.720
We must solve the conflicts
and wars to save humanity.

1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:18.210
Madmen with bombs threaten
more than just prosperity.

1:10:18.210 --> 1:10:20.700
The Native Americans were treated so mean,

1:10:20.700 --> 1:10:23.570
the stolen castle in St. Augustine.

1:10:23.570 --> 1:10:24.830
To find the final clue,

1:10:24.830 --> 1:10:26.420
you must use the key,

1:10:26.420 --> 1:10:29.650
look for the illuminated portals three.

1:10:29.650 --> 1:10:31.230
Open the lock in the box

1:10:31.230 --> 1:10:33.120
in the fortress of the saint.

1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:34.230
When you open the lock,

1:10:34.230 --> 1:10:35.900
you will find the solution

1:10:35.900 --> 1:10:38.967
to war, poverty and pollution.

1:10:38.967 --> 1:10:41.717

- Oh, thank you, young man.

1:11:46.950 --> 1:11:49.090
- [Ticket Seller] Where you headed, ma'am?

1:11:49.090 --> 1:11:50.210
- New York City.

1:11:50.210 --> 1:11:52.050
We're makin' a movie!

1:11:52.050 --> 1:11:53.510
- [Ticker Seller] You and everyone else.

1:11:53.510 --> 1:11:55.250
Six people already came through here today

1:11:55.250 --> 1:11:56.660
sayin' they were makin' movies.

1:11:56.660 --> 1:11:57.910

1:11:58.850 --> 1:11:59.683
- Here you go.

1:12:03.418 --> 1:12:04.440
Where you headed, kids?

1:12:04.440 --> 1:12:05.440
- St. Augustine.

1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:06.300
- St. Augustine?

1:12:06.300 --> 1:12:07.580
What are you doin', makin' a movie?

1:12:07.580 --> 1:12:08.970
- Saving the world.

1:12:08.970 --> 1:12:10.000
- Savin' the world?

1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:11.570
I had seven people come through here

1:12:11.570 --> 1:12:14.410
sayin' they were tryin'
to save the world today.

1:12:14.410 --> 1:12:16.113
That'll be 42.50.

1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.363

1:12:29.850 --> 1:12:32.560
- Hey, can I get a ticket to New York?

1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:34.510

1:12:36.124 --> 1:12:39.584

1:12:39.584 --> 1:12:41.167

1:12:42.421 --> 1:12:43.671
They're closed!

1:12:45.017 --> 1:12:46.380
- We gotta get those kids!

1:12:46.380 --> 1:12:47.650
We need that token.

1:12:47.650 --> 1:12:49.010
That's my retirement plan.

1:12:49.010 --> 1:12:49.843
- Yah!

1:12:50.724 --> 1:12:54.298
(light airy music)

1:12:54.298 --> 1:12:55.131
- That one.

1:12:55.131 --> 1:12:58.010
- [Chilly] You can't just, you
can't just close the gates.

1:12:58.010 --> 1:12:58.843
We need tickets.

1:12:58.843 --> 1:13:00.100
- Sorry, guys, we're closed.

1:13:00.100 --> 1:13:02.190
Next train leaves tomorrow morning.

1:13:02.190 --> 1:13:03.240
- Oh, that's it?

1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:06.330
You know that's why the
train industry's dyin'!

1:13:06.330 --> 1:13:07.163

1:13:07.163 --> 1:13:08.178
so you lift me up.

1:13:08.178 --> 1:13:09.108
Bring me over the top.

We're gonna get you in there.
- Yeah, come on.

1:13:10.307 --> 1:13:12.444

1:13:17.754 --> 1:13:19.004
No way, Iceman!

1:13:22.272 --> 1:13:24.254
- [Olivia] Here we are, train four.

1:13:24.254 --> 1:13:25.153
- [Announcer] Train four will be departing

1:13:25.153 --> 1:13:27.584

1:13:27.584 --> 1:13:28.751
in 15 minutes.

1:13:31.127 --> 1:13:33.100
- You gotta go over that fence.

1:13:33.100 --> 1:13:34.399
- [Chilly] I'm gonna go over the fence?

1:13:34.399 --> 1:13:36.090
- You gotta go get those kids.

1:13:36.090 --> 1:13:36.923

1:13:37.985 --> 1:13:39.128

1:13:39.128 --> 1:13:39.961
You gotta do this.

1:13:39.961 --> 1:13:41.118
Get over the fence.

1:13:41.118 --> 1:13:41.951
(Chilly grunting)

1:13:41.951 --> 1:13:42.846
Chilly, come on.

1:13:42.846 --> 1:13:44.622
Come on, stop foolin' around, will ya?

1:13:44.622 --> 1:13:45.894
Get in there.
(Chilly yells)

1:13:45.894 --> 1:13:47.976
Oh, man, get up, come
on, come on, come on.

1:13:47.976 --> 1:13:49.220
You're on a mission now.

1:13:49.220 --> 1:13:50.840
I want you to go find those kids,

1:13:50.840 --> 1:13:52.150
and I'll go in the truck,

1:13:52.150 --> 1:13:53.330
and I'll meet you on the flip side.

1:13:53.330 --> 1:13:54.163
Find out where they are.

1:13:54.163 --> 1:13:55.413
Let me know.
- Got it, Boss.

1:13:55.413 --> 1:13:56.529
- Good luck.

1:13:56.529 --> 1:13:59.279
(dramatic music)

1:14:19.572 --> 1:14:22.322
(dramatic music)

1:14:25.730 --> 1:14:26.930
- [Chilly] No kids here.

1:14:37.320 --> 1:14:38.153
Kids?

1:14:44.361 --> 1:14:46.280
(rooster crows)

1:14:46.280 --> 1:14:49.559
(peaceful music)

1:14:49.559 --> 1:14:51.976

1:14:58.000 --> 1:14:58.833

1:15:03.570 --> 1:15:04.403
Olivia?

1:15:07.020 --> 1:15:07.903
Jackson, Olivia?

1:15:16.163 --> 1:15:19.246

1:15:20.930 --> 1:15:22.756

1:15:22.756 --> 1:15:25.480
This train goes to Orlando, St. Augustine

1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:27.440

1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:31.010

Orlando, St. Augustine

1:15:33.721 --> 1:15:34.733

1:15:37.503 --> 1:15:40.170
(frantic music)

1:15:42.690 --> 1:15:44.133

Ugh.

1:15:58.459 --> 1:16:01.860
(phone ringing)

1:16:01.860 --> 1:16:02.850
- Dad.

1:16:02.850 --> 1:16:05.100
- Jackson, where are you?

1:16:05.100 --> 1:16:06.480
- On a train.

1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:07.880
- On a train?

1:16:07.880 --> 1:16:09.470
What are you doing on a train?

1:16:09.470 --> 1:16:13.160
- We have some unfinished business.

1:16:13.160 --> 1:16:14.640
- Where are you going?

1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:16.110
- To the Castillo de San Marcos.

1:16:16.110 --> 1:16:16.943
Remember?

1:16:16.943 --> 1:16:17.800
I went there on a school trip.

1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:19.750
- You can't just go to St. Augustine.

1:16:19.750 --> 1:16:20.583
- Why not?

1:16:20.583 --> 1:16:23.050
- Because you're a kid, and
you don't have permission.

1:16:23.050 --> 1:16:24.440
- We're kinda doing it for you.

1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:25.273
- What?

1:16:25.273 --> 1:16:26.810
- We're gonna win the contest,

1:16:26.810 --> 1:16:29.030
get some money and buy the house.

1:16:29.030 --> 1:16:29.900
- No.

1:16:29.900 --> 1:16:31.940
You need to get off that train right now.

1:16:31.940 --> 1:16:33.103
- End of discussion.

1:16:34.930 --> 1:16:35.763
- Jackson?

1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:38.580
- What are you looking at?

1:16:40.224 --> 1:16:42.261
- I was just wondering if we
can get some Huncha Munchas.

1:16:42.261 --> 1:16:43.313
- Huncha Munchas?

1:16:43.313 --> 1:16:44.563
- From the ice cream man.

1:16:45.701 --> 1:16:46.648
(perilous music)

1:16:46.648 --> 1:16:48.268
- What are we gonna do?

1:16:48.268 --> 1:16:49.878
- Where you at?

1:16:49.878 --> 1:16:50.961
Where you at?

1:16:57.697 --> 1:16:59.787
Where are you at, kiddos?

1:16:59.787 --> 1:17:01.180
I'm gonna get.

1:17:01.180 --> 1:17:02.648
There you are!

1:17:02.648 --> 1:17:03.731
Say sayonara.

1:17:04.738 --> 1:17:06.347
Here I come.

1:17:06.347 --> 1:17:08.229
- [Jackson] Get down.

1:17:08.229 --> 1:17:11.083
(Chilly chuckling)

1:17:11.083 --> 1:17:13.833
(dramatic music)

1:17:18.315 --> 1:17:19.565
- Gotcha!
- Run.

1:17:21.258 --> 1:17:22.696
- Go, go, go.
- Get back here.

1:17:22.696 --> 1:17:24.297
- [Olivia] Hurry.

1:17:24.297 --> 1:17:25.547
- [Chilly] Ugh!

1:17:26.784 --> 1:17:28.034
Gimme that key!

1:17:28.978 --> 1:17:30.747
- [Man] Hey!

1:17:30.747 --> 1:17:31.912
- Can't you knock?
- We need to find

1:17:31.912 --> 1:17:32.974
a place to hide.
- I'm gonna get you!

1:17:32.974 --> 1:17:34.632
- Quickly!
- All these rooms are full!

1:17:34.632 --> 1:17:36.320
- [Passenger] Hey, this room is occupied!

1:17:36.320 --> 1:17:37.770
- [Jackson] Come on, in here.

1:17:38.630 --> 1:17:40.478
- [Olivia] Not here, go across.

1:17:40.478 --> 1:17:41.378
Come on, let's go.

1:17:47.397 --> 1:17:48.314
Shh, quiet.

1:17:49.499 --> 1:17:52.210
Ready, go.
- They're in here!

1:17:52.210 --> 1:17:54.071
- Wait for it.
- This is confusing.

1:17:54.071 --> 1:17:55.570
- [Olivia] Let's go.

1:17:55.570 --> 1:17:57.956
- [Chilly] What am I, teleporting?

1:17:57.956 --> 1:17:59.303
Is this a wormhole?

1:18:00.790 --> 1:18:04.380
Is there a bend in the
fabric of space time?

1:18:04.380 --> 1:18:05.253
I'm so confused!

1:18:06.719 --> 1:18:08.690
- And now!
- Is this a crazy dream?

1:18:08.690 --> 1:18:11.600
Some kind of weird clown car?
- Let's make a break for it.

1:18:11.600 --> 1:18:13.343
- [Jackson] The coast is clear, hurry!

1:18:15.747 --> 1:18:18.164
(rock music)

1:18:23.700 --> 1:18:26.140
- No time to explain, Janet.

1:18:26.140 --> 1:18:27.063
I'll be there.

1:18:28.122 --> 1:18:29.540
At the private airport.

1:18:29.540 --> 1:18:31.663
My truck was repossessed, by the way.

1:18:34.473 --> 1:18:36.283
(sighs) I am gonna get those kids.

1:18:50.585 --> 1:18:52.774
(people talking)

1:18:52.774 --> 1:18:53.950
- [Jackson] I have an idea.

1:18:53.950 --> 1:18:56.270
Uh, ma'am, can I take
your bags to the back?

1:18:56.270 --> 1:18:57.103
- Oh, sure.

1:18:57.103 --> 1:18:58.403
Thank you so much, young man.

1:18:59.421 --> 1:19:02.504
(light bouncy music)

1:19:04.666 --> 1:19:06.450
- [Jackson] We have to find
something inconspicuous.

1:19:06.450 --> 1:19:07.987
- [Olivia] Got it.

1:19:07.987 --> 1:19:09.323
What does inconspicuous mean?

1:19:12.500 --> 1:19:15.050
- This is what you
brought, my old scooter?

1:19:15.050 --> 1:19:16.830
- You always hated this scooter,

1:19:16.830 --> 1:19:18.430
and I got it for you.

1:19:18.430 --> 1:19:20.260
- We're gonna get there on this thing?

1:19:20.260 --> 1:19:21.420
What are you thinking?

1:19:21.420 --> 1:19:22.490
- Don't, don't worry about it.

1:19:22.490 --> 1:19:23.323
Just get on.

1:19:30.229 --> 1:19:32.729
(funny music)

1:19:34.350 --> 1:19:37.100
(dramatic music)

1:19:44.355 --> 1:19:45.188
- Yah!

1:19:47.533 --> 1:19:48.366
Hey.

1:19:48.366 --> 1:19:49.510
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:19:49.510 --> 1:19:50.660
- [Jackson] Act normal.

1:19:51.590 --> 1:19:53.460
- Have you seen?

1:19:53.460 --> 1:19:55.190
Guys, have you seen two little kids

1:19:55.190 --> 1:19:57.490
about yeah big, dirty faces?

1:19:57.490 --> 1:19:58.323
Hey.

1:19:59.720 --> 1:20:01.270
Excuse me, sir.

1:20:01.270 --> 1:20:03.010
Fine, ma'am. (chuckles)

1:20:03.010 --> 1:20:05.525
Have you seen two little kids?

1:20:05.525 --> 1:20:07.320
- About 12 and nine years old?

1:20:07.320 --> 1:20:08.153
- Yeah.

1:20:09.030 --> 1:20:10.440
- No, sorry, I'm just having a spot of tea

1:20:10.440 --> 1:20:11.455
with the samurai.

1:20:11.455 --> 1:20:14.288
(Olivia slurping)

1:20:15.480 --> 1:20:19.519
- Huh?

1:20:19.519 --> 1:20:20.352
Uh.

1:20:26.744 --> 1:20:27.577
Ew!

1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:34.953
Ugh.

1:20:40.920 --> 1:20:41.753
Hmm.

1:20:50.143 --> 1:20:53.220
Hey, wait a minute.

1:20:53.220 --> 1:20:55.127
You're not even old!

1:20:55.127 --> 1:20:56.310
- [Jackson] No, no, waiter!

1:20:56.310 --> 1:20:59.173
- I knew it was you kids.
- Sir, sir, you can't be

1:20:59.173 --> 1:21:00.050
in here without a ticket.

1:21:00.050 --> 1:21:02.200
- Hey, hey, what.

1:21:02.200 --> 1:21:03.370
- I am so sorry about that.
- But, we're gonna,

1:21:03.370 --> 1:21:04.850
I'm gonna.
- Come on,

1:21:04.850 --> 1:21:06.490
let's go, sir.
- The treasure's ours, kids!

1:21:06.490 --> 1:21:08.447
- [Conductor] Calm down, sir.

1:21:08.447 --> 1:21:10.248
(Chilly struggling)

1:21:10.248 --> 1:21:12.998
(dramatic music)

1:21:15.409 --> 1:21:16.510
(Chilly yells)

1:21:16.510 --> 1:21:17.343
- And stay out!

1:21:17.343 --> 1:21:18.830
- No tickets.
- No service.

1:21:21.582 --> 1:21:22.640
(dramatic music)

1:21:22.640 --> 1:21:23.850
- I know where they're going!

1:21:23.850 --> 1:21:25.730
- Let's go.
- Ha, I know

1:21:25.730 --> 1:21:27.330
where they're goin', Boss.

1:21:27.330 --> 1:21:30.182
St. Augustine! (laughs)

1:21:30.182 --> 1:21:33.015
(hard rock music)

1:21:47.801 --> 1:21:48.634
- We're gonna make it.
- I don't think

1:21:48.634 --> 1:21:49.467
we're gonna make it!

1:21:49.467 --> 1:21:50.550
I don't know how I let
you talk me into this!

1:21:50.550 --> 1:21:52.910
- Just eight more hours.

1:21:52.910 --> 1:21:53.743
Hang in there.

1:21:54.979 --> 1:21:57.581
You can do it for the kids.

1:21:57.581 --> 1:22:00.914
(train whistle blowing)

1:22:09.341 --> 1:22:13.000
(suspenseful music)

1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:13.993
- [Olivia] Which way is it?

1:22:13.993 --> 1:22:15.780
- Come on, hurry.

1:22:15.780 --> 1:22:17.633
It's this way.
- It's that way.

1:22:18.670 --> 1:22:19.503
We're close.

1:22:19.503 --> 1:22:20.336
It's right there.

1:22:26.446 --> 1:22:28.400
(light bouncy music)

1:22:28.400 --> 1:22:30.030
- They're closed.

1:22:30.030 --> 1:22:31.693
Liv, ice cream men.

1:22:33.230 --> 1:22:36.190
Look, you go, and I'll hold them off.

1:22:36.190 --> 1:22:37.650
- Action, not inaction.

1:22:37.650 --> 1:22:39.270
Here, take this sword.

1:22:39.270 --> 1:22:40.103
You might need it.

1:22:40.103 --> 1:22:42.549
And remember, get that key.

1:22:42.549 --> 1:22:45.299
(dramatic music)

1:22:58.698 --> 1:22:59.584
- [Jackson] Where do you think

1:22:59.584 --> 1:23:00.570
you're going?
- Oh, there you are.

1:23:00.570 --> 1:23:03.069
I got somethin' you're lookin' for.

1:23:03.069 --> 1:23:05.022
- [Jackson] That's ours!

1:23:05.022 --> 1:23:06.019
Ha!
- Ugh.

1:23:06.019 --> 1:23:08.058
Now this is mine.

1:23:08.058 --> 1:23:09.717
Ha ha, it's broken.

1:23:09.717 --> 1:23:10.550
It won't open!

1:23:10.550 --> 1:23:11.383
- [Jackson] It's a prop.

1:23:11.383 --> 1:23:12.677
There's no blade, Huncha Muncha man.

1:23:12.677 --> 1:23:13.970
- Oh, a prop.

1:23:13.970 --> 1:23:15.313
Well then, it's on.

1:23:16.405 --> 1:23:17.806
- [Jackson] Let's dance.

1:23:17.806 --> 1:23:19.380
- Hee ah!
- Yah!

1:23:19.380 --> 1:23:22.769
(both grunting)

1:23:22.769 --> 1:23:23.602
- Oh!

1:23:27.460 --> 1:23:29.210
- [Olivia] Clue, clue.

1:23:29.210 --> 1:23:30.580
Under here.

1:23:30.580 --> 1:23:31.413
Nothing here.

1:23:32.303 --> 1:23:33.723
Uh, where could it be?

1:23:41.830 --> 1:23:43.460
Illuminated portals three.

1:23:43.460 --> 1:23:44.343
I need the key.

1:23:46.348 --> 1:23:49.015
(both grunting)

1:23:56.220 --> 1:23:57.258
- This is ours.
- You're never gonna get it.

1:23:57.258 --> 1:23:58.747
- It's always been ours.
- Never gonna get it.

1:23:58.747 --> 1:23:59.580
Ugh.

1:24:00.427 --> 1:24:01.844
- I need the key.

1:24:03.210 --> 1:24:05.090
- I was certainly surprised to monitor

1:24:05.090 --> 1:24:06.650
the security cameras to see

1:24:06.650 --> 1:24:10.150
that this puzzle may
be solved by children!

1:24:10.150 --> 1:24:12.010
It was designed for adults,

1:24:12.010 --> 1:24:13.670
designed by adult minds

1:24:13.670 --> 1:24:15.840
to be signed by adult analysis.

1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:18.350
But these children may
be the most brilliant

1:24:18.350 --> 1:24:19.317
geniuses of all,

1:24:19.317 --> 1:24:22.063
and they have solved the
key of the Planet Puzzlers.

1:24:27.768 --> 1:24:30.590
- Whew, we made it.

1:24:30.590 --> 1:24:31.833
- We sure did.

1:24:32.802 --> 1:24:34.398
Ew, what happened to your face?

1:24:34.398 --> 1:24:35.231
- Ow, ow, ow!

1:24:35.231 --> 1:24:36.680
- It's all burnt.

1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:38.573
Why didn't you use sunscreen?

1:24:39.970 --> 1:24:41.970
- How do you still look perfect?

1:24:41.970 --> 1:24:43.930
- Well, number one, I wear sunscreen.

1:24:43.930 --> 1:24:45.730
I exfoliate and moisturize.

1:24:45.730 --> 1:24:48.310
I tone, multivitamins,

1:24:48.310 --> 1:24:49.270
eight glasses of water.

1:24:49.270 --> 1:24:50.998
- All right.
- A good night's sleep.

1:24:50.998 --> 1:24:51.831
- All right,

1:24:51.831 --> 1:24:53.220
let's just get the kids.
- Vegetables.

1:24:53.220 --> 1:24:54.890
So your truck was repossessed?

1:24:54.890 --> 1:24:56.060
- [Brad] Yeah, I missed a payment.

1:24:56.060 --> 1:24:58.000
Someone drained my bank account.

1:24:58.000 --> 1:24:59.500
- [Janet] I did go a little crazy.

1:24:59.500 --> 1:25:02.100
I think we can be a little more amicable.

1:25:02.100 --> 1:25:03.440
I've been learning about this new thing

1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:04.800
called co-parenting.

1:25:04.800 --> 1:25:06.485
- Iceman!
- Chilly, where are you?

1:25:06.485 --> 1:25:09.046
- Iceman, down here!
- Chilly, where are you?

1:25:09.046 --> 1:25:10.155
- Iceman!
- Hey, Chilly, how did

1:25:10.155 --> 1:25:11.640
you get down there?
- Help me out!

1:25:11.640 --> 1:25:13.400
- What, what, where are the kids?

1:25:13.400 --> 1:25:14.670
- [Chilly] They got the key!

1:25:14.670 --> 1:25:15.503
- Where's the key?

1:25:15.503 --> 1:25:16.664
They got the key?

1:25:16.664 --> 1:25:17.497
How did they get the key?

1:25:17.497 --> 1:25:19.200
- [Chilly] The little
kid kicked my keister

1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:20.270
and stole the key!

1:25:20.270 --> 1:25:22.550
- You let 'em get away with the key?

1:25:22.550 --> 1:25:24.833
Come on, man.
- They got it, Iceman.

1:25:25.820 --> 1:25:27.837
Oh, Scrooge McMoneygills.
- You let them

1:25:27.837 --> 1:25:29.535
get away with the key?
- Scrooge McMoneygills.

1:25:29.535 --> 1:25:30.820
- Who, who's that?

1:25:30.820 --> 1:25:32.944
- [Chilly] Scrooge McMoneygills.

1:25:32.944 --> 1:25:35.750
- W-what's he doin' here?

1:25:37.647 --> 1:25:40.647
(suspenseful music)

1:25:47.755 --> 1:25:51.088
(floorboards squeaking)

1:25:58.553 --> 1:25:59.890
- The lock in the box

1:25:59.890 --> 1:26:02.307
in the fortress of the saint.

1:26:12.453 --> 1:26:15.203
(wondrous music)

1:26:17.450 --> 1:26:19.080
I saw a code on the key.

1:26:20.845 --> 1:26:21.678
822729.

1:26:25.820 --> 1:26:26.653
It's us!

1:26:28.070 --> 1:26:29.770
- [Both] We're the answer.

1:26:29.770 --> 1:26:31.584
- Quick, get your laptop.

1:26:31.584 --> 1:26:34.584
(suspenseful music)

1:26:47.948 --> 1:26:48.872
(celebratory music)

1:26:48.872 --> 1:26:50.169
- [Both] We won!

1:26:50.169 --> 1:26:51.178
- [Billy] Well, congratulations.

1:26:51.178 --> 1:26:52.599
You solved all the clues

1:26:52.599 --> 1:26:53.432
- We won.
- And found out the key

1:26:53.432 --> 1:26:56.040
to solving the world's problems is you.

1:26:56.040 --> 1:26:57.807
You will be awarded a sum total

1:26:57.807 --> 1:26:59.560
of one million dollars

1:26:59.560 --> 1:27:02.510
and all the Huncha Muncha
samiches you can eat.

1:27:02.510 --> 1:27:04.330
My assistant and I have been monitoring

1:27:04.330 --> 1:27:07.130
you on closed circuit
cameras in each location,

1:27:07.130 --> 1:27:09.090
and as sure as you are watchin' this,

1:27:09.090 --> 1:27:11.060
we are on route to shake your hand

1:27:11.060 --> 1:27:12.410
and give you your winnings.

1:27:13.296 --> 1:27:14.695
(exciting music)

1:27:14.695 --> 1:27:16.026
- [Jackson] We won.

1:27:16.026 --> 1:27:17.299
- [Olivia] We won.

1:27:17.299 --> 1:27:18.659
We won.

1:27:18.659 --> 1:27:19.891
We won.

1:27:19.891 --> 1:27:20.724
We won.

1:27:20.724 --> 1:27:21.557
We won.

1:27:21.557 --> 1:27:22.390
(happy music)

1:27:22.390 --> 1:27:23.223
We won.

1:27:23.223 --> 1:27:24.056
We won.

1:27:24.056 --> 1:27:24.889
We won.

1:27:25.781 --> 1:27:26.614
We won.

1:27:27.448 --> 1:27:28.311
We won.

1:27:28.311 --> 1:27:29.144
We did it.

1:27:29.144 --> 1:27:29.977
- Jackson!
- We did it.

1:27:29.977 --> 1:27:31.140
- Olivia!
- We did it.

1:27:31.140 --> 1:27:35.183
You two have no idea how
much trouble you are in.

1:27:36.088 --> 1:27:36.921
- [Olivia] Dad, how did you find us?

1:27:36.921 --> 1:27:38.430
- Dad, why are you yelling?

1:27:38.430 --> 1:27:39.660
- I'm yelling?

1:27:39.660 --> 1:27:41.200
Yes.

1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:42.850
Because I'm furious,

1:27:42.850 --> 1:27:45.550
and because I can't hear.

1:27:45.550 --> 1:27:48.820
Your mother and I have been riding a moped

1:27:48.820 --> 1:27:50.536
all day to get here.

1:27:50.536 --> 1:27:52.180
(light music)

1:27:52.180 --> 1:27:55.610
You have got to stop running off

1:27:55.610 --> 1:28:00.160
to scenic and historically
significant locations.

1:28:00.160 --> 1:28:04.640
And letting deranged ice
cream truck men kidnap you!

1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:06.090
- [Olivia] But, Dad, we won.

1:28:06.090 --> 1:28:08.420
- It's just gonna be
a bunch of merchandise

1:28:08.420 --> 1:28:10.400
you'll probably have a lifetime supply

1:28:10.400 --> 1:28:12.863
of Muncha Huncha Muncha T-shirts!

1:28:13.994 --> 1:28:14.940
- Um.
- Any money

1:28:14.940 --> 1:28:17.940
is just gonna go to taxes and fees.

1:28:17.940 --> 1:28:19.570
- [Billy] He does have a good point there.

1:28:19.570 --> 1:28:20.750
- [Brad] Thank you.

1:28:20.750 --> 1:28:23.410
- However, $600,000 net profit

1:28:23.410 --> 1:28:25.930
is a not inconsiderable
amount of money, is it?

1:28:25.930 --> 1:28:28.160
- It is to the rest of us.

1:28:28.160 --> 1:28:29.240
- Wait, what?

1:28:29.240 --> 1:28:34.240
- You mean you two came up here together?

1:28:34.270 --> 1:28:35.840
- We did, and we're going to be

1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:38.240
doing a lot more together too.

1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:39.550
- And these children,

1:28:39.550 --> 1:28:41.730
these most genius children on the planet,

1:28:41.730 --> 1:28:43.060
have solved the puzzle,

1:28:43.060 --> 1:28:45.270
a puzzle I designed for adults.

1:28:45.270 --> 1:28:46.764
I hired the top scientists,

1:28:46.764 --> 1:28:50.560
the best psychologists
and the most amazing

1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:51.850
middle school science teachers,

1:28:51.850 --> 1:28:52.683
and they solved it.

1:28:52.683 --> 1:28:54.440
- You're Billy Bob Branson!

1:28:54.440 --> 1:28:56.063
- Oh, my God, I am!

1:28:57.110 --> 1:28:58.730
- My name is Brad Johnson.

1:28:58.730 --> 1:29:00.640
I have applied for a number of positions

1:29:00.640 --> 1:29:01.600
within your company.

1:29:01.600 --> 1:29:03.160
I'm still shouting, aren't I?

1:29:05.419 --> 1:29:08.020
- Are you the lovely progenitor

1:29:08.020 --> 1:29:10.150
of these fine genius offspring?

1:29:10.150 --> 1:29:10.983
- Why, yes.

1:29:10.983 --> 1:29:12.440
I'm Janet Johnson.

1:29:12.440 --> 1:29:13.650
- You should be so proud.

1:29:13.650 --> 1:29:16.720
They are the most genius
children on the planet.

1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:20.060
They have solved the puzzle
that was designed for adults.

1:29:20.060 --> 1:29:22.990
I hired the top scientists,
the top psychologists

1:29:22.990 --> 1:29:25.113
and the very best middle
school science teachers,

1:29:25.113 --> 1:29:27.940
and these chosen children have solved it.

1:29:27.940 --> 1:29:30.340
I must enroll them in
my scholarship program

1:29:30.340 --> 1:29:31.860
to take care of their education.

1:29:31.860 --> 1:29:34.190
And, furthermore, put them in charge

1:29:34.190 --> 1:29:35.800
of my Planet Puzzler program

1:29:35.800 --> 1:29:38.350
so that they can teach other children

1:29:38.350 --> 1:29:40.150
the kind of genius that they have released

1:29:40.150 --> 1:29:42.198
upon this wonderful world.

1:29:42.198 --> 1:29:44.620
- That is so amazing.

1:29:44.620 --> 1:29:45.990
- I'll see to it that they are paired

1:29:45.990 --> 1:29:49.046
with the best possible team
of creatives to assist them.

1:29:49.046 --> 1:29:49.879
- Hmm.

1:29:49.879 --> 1:29:51.130
- Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

1:29:51.130 --> 1:29:52.920
I don't believe it.

1:29:52.920 --> 1:29:53.840
- Wait a minute!

1:29:53.840 --> 1:29:58.000
Mr. Branson, I'm your number
one ice cream sandwich seller

1:29:58.000 --> 1:29:59.152
in the whole wide world.

1:29:59.152 --> 1:29:59.985
- Mm hmm.

1:29:59.985 --> 1:30:01.600
- And now, these kids,

1:30:01.600 --> 1:30:03.500
these kids are gonna take all

1:30:03.500 --> 1:30:05.670
that treasure money away from me?

1:30:05.670 --> 1:30:08.600
After all the work and
effort we put into this?

1:30:08.600 --> 1:30:11.303
Do you know how long I been
looking forward to this?

1:30:12.630 --> 1:30:14.170
I mean, come on!

1:30:14.170 --> 1:30:16.130
You gotta give me something for this, sir.

1:30:16.130 --> 1:30:18.380
- Well, I have been
monitoring this entire contest

1:30:18.380 --> 1:30:19.920
on security cameras,

1:30:19.920 --> 1:30:22.250
and I can tell you that the two of you are

1:30:22.250 --> 1:30:26.790
eligible for 10 to 20 years
in the state penitentiary

1:30:26.790 --> 1:30:29.540
if these children should
so choose to press charges.

1:30:29.540 --> 1:30:31.380
- Just a moment here.

1:30:31.380 --> 1:30:33.350
Do you realize how hard we worked?

1:30:33.350 --> 1:30:34.183
Do you?

1:30:34.183 --> 1:30:36.030
- But he's the world's greatest ice cream

1:30:36.030 --> 1:30:37.717
salesman in the world!

1:30:38.590 --> 1:30:40.760
- How are we gonna get home?

1:30:40.760 --> 1:30:43.110
- How about a trip in
our corporate helicopter?

1:30:43.110 --> 1:30:45.270
The ride down to Boca Raton is beautiful.

1:30:45.270 --> 1:30:47.340
- [Olivia] Awesome, a helicopter!

1:30:47.340 --> 1:30:48.589
- [Jackson] Can we get a pizza?

1:30:48.589 --> 1:30:51.589
(Iceman stammering)

1:30:55.743 --> 1:30:58.742
- There goes Scrooge
McMoneygills with all our money!

1:30:58.742 --> 1:30:59.620
- [Iceman] Mr. Branson!

1:30:59.620 --> 1:31:00.620
Mr. Branson!

1:31:01.942 --> 1:31:03.534
Ugh!

1:31:03.534 --> 1:31:04.440
Get outta the way.

1:31:04.440 --> 1:31:05.960
I don't need you anymore!

1:31:05.960 --> 1:31:06.793
You're fired!

1:31:08.557 --> 1:31:11.350
- I thought we were a team.
- Don't follow me!

1:31:13.950 --> 1:31:16.533
(sneaky music)

1:31:25.137 --> 1:31:28.054
(Chilly chuckling)

1:31:29.290 --> 1:31:31.089
- [Chilly] Uh oh.

1:31:31.089 --> 1:31:33.672
(cannon fires)

1:31:36.215 --> 1:31:38.309
(explosion booms)

1:31:38.309 --> 1:31:41.226
(Chilly chuckling)

1:31:44.269 --> 1:31:47.436
(school bell ringing)

1:31:50.940 --> 1:31:53.700
- All right, all right, settle down.

1:31:53.700 --> 1:31:56.040
Settle down, settle down.

1:31:56.040 --> 1:31:57.853
Please take your seats.

1:32:00.360 --> 1:32:02.450
Welcome back from the break, all right.

1:32:02.450 --> 1:32:03.800
I'm your teacher, Mr. Cook.

1:32:03.800 --> 1:32:05.840
So over the break, I know you guys

1:32:05.840 --> 1:32:06.830
had to do a report

1:32:06.830 --> 1:32:09.554
on this wonderful book
called "Should, Could and"

1:32:09.554 --> 1:32:10.733
- [Children] And Would.

1:32:10.733 --> 1:32:11.566
- That's right, so I want to hear examples

1:32:11.566 --> 1:32:13.770
from you guys, and I want you to chime in.

1:32:13.770 --> 1:32:14.603
Don't be afraid.

1:32:14.603 --> 1:32:15.950
Does anyone have any examples

1:32:15.950 --> 1:32:18.100
on how you took action over the summer?

1:32:18.100 --> 1:32:19.610
Yes, Olivia?

1:32:19.610 --> 1:32:21.680
- Well, here's a story
of how we took action,

1:32:21.680 --> 1:32:23.440
won a million dollars, saved our house

1:32:23.440 --> 1:32:26.030
and got our dad a job!

1:32:26.030 --> 1:32:28.420
'Cause action, not inaction
was a lesson we were taught.

1:32:28.420 --> 1:32:29.970
- [Mr. Cook] A million dollars?

1:32:31.652 --> 1:32:33.450
I can't wait to hear this story.

1:32:33.450 --> 1:32:36.520
- [Olivia] It all started at
the end of last school year.

1:32:36.520 --> 1:32:37.800
I entered a contest,

1:32:37.800 --> 1:32:40.070
and my brother and I solved the clue.

1:32:40.070 --> 1:32:41.460
But these evil ice cream men

1:32:41.460 --> 1:32:42.910
stole our winning ticket.

1:32:42.910 --> 1:32:45.310
And my brother and I stole it back,

1:32:45.310 --> 1:32:46.730
and solved the first clue,

1:32:46.730 --> 1:32:48.920
which led us on an epic adventure

1:32:48.920 --> 1:32:51.230
