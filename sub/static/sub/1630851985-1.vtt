<i>[Amy] So,
there's been a guy around.</i>

00:12.980 --> 00:14.513
<i>He's definitely a creeper.</i>

00:14.515 --> 00:18.650
It's an unusual amount
of anger that he has.

00:18.652 --> 00:21.720
When I had woken up,
I was being choked.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.722
We have demons in this house.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.357
[Matthew]
Did he just jump you now?

00:26.559 --> 00:27.393
Yeah.

00:29.262 --> 00:31.363
There was bloody handprints
all over.

00:31.365 --> 00:35.467
He can jump into the body
of living people?

00:35.469 --> 00:37.136
- Can I?
- [Steven] Yes, sure.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.570
[Amy] What's the matter?

00:39.406 --> 00:40.539
[Paije speaking]

00:41.908 --> 00:43.042
<i>[Amy] This makes me nervous.</i>

00:43.044 --> 00:44.877
<i>He wants to kill them.</i>

00:46.780 --> 00:48.347
He wants the person dead.

00:48.349 --> 00:49.815
My name is Amy Allan.

00:50.884 --> 00:51.817
I see dead people.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.686
I saw a lean creature.

00:54.688 --> 00:58.123
I speak to dead people
and they speak to me.

00:59.025 --> 01:01.260
This person feels
like a monster.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.628
But there's only one way to know

01:02.630 --> 01:04.096
if my findings were real.

01:04.098 --> 01:08.033
They're sucking the life
out of this people.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.701
I rely on my partner.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.070
I'm Steve DiSchiavi,

01:11.072 --> 01:12.971
I'm a retired New York City
Homicide Detective.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.606
So how many bodies we talking?

01:14.608 --> 01:18.777
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.345
It's my job to reveal them.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.181
But Steve and I never speak...

01:22.183 --> 01:24.249
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.918
until the very end.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.820
Oh, you're not gonna like this.

01:27.822 --> 01:29.721
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay.

01:29.723 --> 01:30.622
I'm sorry.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.624
I need to take a break.

01:32.626 --> 01:33.992
Or time to get out.

01:33.994 --> 01:36.462
It wants inside the house
because it wants to kill you.

<i>It's a couple hours

<i>It's hot as hell up here,</i>

01:56.217 --> 01:58.283
<i>but this was a case
I just had to take.</i>

01:58.285 --> 02:00.552
<i>A desperate woman
named Monette called,</i>

02:00.554 --> 02:03.489
<i>says whatever's in her house
killed her roommate,</i>

02:03.491 --> 02:06.525
<i>and if we can't help,
it's gonna kill again.</i>

02:06.527 --> 02:10.129
My granddaughter
has been recently choked

02:10.131 --> 02:12.431
by a demon in her sleep.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.333
<i>[Steve] Monette sounds
real shook up.</i>

02:14.335 --> 02:17.136
<i>I'm hoping Amy and I can find
a way to help her out.</i>

[crickets chirping]

02:26.346 --> 02:29.414
[Amy] Oh, oh.

02:29.416 --> 02:36.088
The area has an extremely,
heavy, sad, uh, vibe,

02:38.358 --> 02:43.562
like maybe there had been
a great loss at some point.

02:43.564 --> 02:48.167
The problem with that is that
the living, uh, could be,

02:48.169 --> 02:52.271
uh, susceptible to feeling
this sadness,

02:52.273 --> 02:53.739
this depression.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.108
Bad situation...
Bad situation.

02:56.110 --> 02:58.877
[crickets chirping]

02:58.879 --> 03:02.047
[ominous music playing]

03:03.616 --> 03:05.551
<i>[Steven] So Monette,
this is a big beautiful home</i>

03:05.553 --> 03:07.286
<i>you have here,</i>

03:07.288 --> 03:08.554
<i>but when we spoke on the phone,</i>

03:08.556 --> 03:09.888
<i>you sounded pretty upset.</i>

03:09.890 --> 03:11.757
<i>Why don't you tell me
what's going on?</i>

03:11.759 --> 03:13.825
We have demons in this house

03:13.827 --> 03:16.628
and it's a very dangerous place.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.664
Demons is pretty specific.

03:18.666 --> 03:21.266
Um, what makes you say
its demons?

03:21.268 --> 03:23.068
From the things I've seen
and the things

03:23.070 --> 03:24.403
that are going under this house,

03:24.405 --> 03:27.005
I don't think it could be
anything else, but...

03:27.007 --> 03:29.107
Now, you also mentioned
on the phone that, uh,

03:29.109 --> 03:30.909
the paranormal killed
your roommate?

03:30.911 --> 03:32.077
Yes.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.145
[Steve] Tell me about that.

03:33.147 --> 03:34.279
His name was Thomas,

03:34.281 --> 03:36.415
and he was my really
good friend,

03:36.417 --> 03:37.616
- and roommate.
- Okay.

03:37.618 --> 03:38.951
And we bought the house
together.

03:38.953 --> 03:41.320
He died of a heart attack
last year.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.454
How old was he?

03:42.456 --> 03:43.855
[Monette] He was 81.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.090
The man is 81 years old.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.926
Dying from a heart attack
is not uncommon.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.963
Um, what makes you think
it's paranormal related?

03:54.133 --> 03:55.634
It's upsetting for you
talk about it?

03:55.636 --> 03:57.236
- He was my friend.
- [Steve] Yeah.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.738
And he was very healthy.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.840
It couldn't be anything else.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.543
We loved him very much
and we miss him.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.878
So, Monette,
let's get to some basics.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.213
Who lives in the house?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.182
Okay.

04:10.184 --> 04:11.683
[Monette] That's me,
and then there's

04:11.685 --> 04:14.253
my 20-year-old granddaughter,
Paije,

04:14.255 --> 04:17.723
and on the other side
is Thomas's son, Steven.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.191
Do me a favor. Give me a list

04:19.193 --> 04:21.360
of what you guys
are experiencing here.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.428
<i>We're seeing shadow figures,</i>

04:23.430 --> 04:25.497
<i>people are being
physically attacked,</i>

04:25.499 --> 04:28.867
<i>and we are having a lot
of mood swings, and fatigue,</i>

04:28.869 --> 04:31.069
and we're all getting sick.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.605
Uh, what kind of elements
are we talking about?

04:33.607 --> 04:36.341
Steven also had a heart attack.

04:36.343 --> 04:37.609
Okay. How old is he?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.511
He is 52.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.480
Ooh, okay. What else?

04:41.482 --> 04:43.482
What about you
and your granddaughter?

04:43.484 --> 04:47.019
I have broken bones in my
ankle and foot right now.

04:47.021 --> 04:48.754
I have no idea
how they happened.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.889
Okay. So you didn't have an
accident and all of a sudden

04:50.891 --> 04:52.491
- you got broken bones?
- [Monette] Exactly.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.059
[Steve] And what about
your granddaughter?

04:54.061 --> 04:57.763
Well, Paije right now is, uh,
stable from being a victim

04:57.765 --> 05:01.466
of clival chordoma cancer
in her brain.

05:01.468 --> 05:05.304
She was doing rather well
and very stable...

05:05.306 --> 05:08.340
- Okay.
- until we moved in here.

05:08.342 --> 05:11.443
And now she has several
medical issues.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.211
What about, uh,
the mood changes,

05:13.213 --> 05:14.246
what do you mean by that?

05:14.248 --> 05:16.148
I get angry right away.

05:16.150 --> 05:19.184
I used to be really
happy-go-lucky.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.320
Steven has periodic tantrums.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.855
He gets flies off the handle
for little things.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.023
Okay.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.291
<i>It is a nice house.</i>

05:26.293 --> 05:28.493
<i>I mean, is it worth
staying here though?</i>

05:28.495 --> 05:31.997
It's all we have
and we can't afford to leave.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.199
Monette, listening to you,
it's breaking my heart

05:34.201 --> 05:35.701
hearing what you guys
are going through

05:35.703 --> 05:37.769
especially
with your granddaughter.

05:37.771 --> 05:38.970
How are you holding up?

05:38.972 --> 05:40.339
I'm very, very tired.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.607
I don't feel like I've slept
for five years.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.042
And you believe
it's the paranormal?

05:44.044 --> 05:45.243
Absolutely.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.845
Something's sucking the life
out of me

05:46.847 --> 05:49.114
and changing the quality
of my existence.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.851
- [crickets chirping]
- [ominous music playing]

05:52.853 --> 05:55.554
[Amy]
So, there's been a guy around.

05:55.556 --> 05:59.458
I think he's like
in his 30s age-wise.

05:59.460 --> 06:05.564
He likes to just watch people,
watching, watching, watching.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.367
He'll like get up on you.

06:08.369 --> 06:12.270
He really does have
a pretty intense vibe.

06:12.272 --> 06:17.576
Even if you aren't seeing him,
you would feel his presence,

06:17.578 --> 06:20.011
so you feel kind of bothered.

06:20.013 --> 06:23.715
<i>When he's with you, I think that</i>

06:23.717 --> 06:28.453
<i>that living person
would change dramatically.</i>

06:28.455 --> 06:33.225
He's definitely a creeper,
just unnerving, unsettling.

06:33.227 --> 06:36.261
[ominous music playing]

06:38.097 --> 06:40.365
<i>[Monette] This is the worst
room in the house.</i>

06:40.367 --> 06:42.033
Okay.
So tell me what's going on.

06:42.035 --> 06:45.904
Well, there's like a menacing
stalker in this room.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.440
It feels like somebody's
always behind you

06:48.442 --> 06:50.041
wherever I go in this room.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.243
Is this something you could see

06:51.245 --> 06:52.344
or is it just a presence?

06:52.346 --> 06:53.478
No, I can't see it.

06:53.480 --> 06:57.282
It's some type of presence,
but it's on you,

06:57.284 --> 06:59.117
ready to jump at you
at any time.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.586
You feel like
you're gonna be attacked.

07:01.588 --> 07:02.788
What else?

07:02.790 --> 07:05.524
Things go missing around here
all the time.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.225
Okay. Like what?

07:07.227 --> 07:09.628
- I'll set my keys on the bed.
- Okay.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.363
And I'll go wash my hands
or brush my teeth.

07:11.365 --> 07:13.432
I'll come back and my keys
are gone.

07:13.434 --> 07:14.733
Tear my room up.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.936
I come back and they're right
where they were before.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.604
Okay, I mean, I misplace stuff
all the time,

07:19.606 --> 07:21.206
and I think they're there,
but they're not.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.275
But you're saying it kind of
like when you come back,

07:23.277 --> 07:25.510
- it's where it was originally?
- Exactly where it was,

07:25.512 --> 07:28.280
and it's really pissing me off.

07:28.282 --> 07:31.316
[ominous music playing]

07:32.251 --> 07:34.019
[door squeaking]

07:35.721 --> 07:37.255
<i>[Amy] The creeper.</i>

07:37.257 --> 07:40.225
<i>He was a bad guy
when he was alive.</i>

07:40.227 --> 07:42.294
<i>He likes to steal
and move things.</i>

07:45.331 --> 07:46.698
[Matthew]
Like what sort of things?

07:46.700 --> 07:50.268
Like, oh, look, the remote,
oh, [bleep].

07:50.270 --> 07:53.472
I'll make that disappear
for like a week.

07:57.877 --> 07:59.878
<i>[Steve] All right.
So what else is going on?</i>

07:59.880 --> 08:02.314
I have been choked before.

08:02.316 --> 08:03.949
Tell me about that.
What happened?

08:03.951 --> 08:07.152
My throat was shut,
stuck together inside.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.821
I could not get any air
in or out.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.223
This went on for a minute
and a half.

08:11.225 --> 08:12.991
I really thought
I was gonna die.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.926
You think the angle here
is to kill you

08:14.928 --> 08:16.428
or kill everybody in the house?

08:16.430 --> 08:17.496
I do.

08:17.498 --> 08:18.697
I absolutely do.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.432
And I don't wanna be next.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.004
<i>[Amy] Seeing like
a living woman here.</i>

08:29.542 --> 08:31.243
This is, like, crazy at night.

08:31.245 --> 08:32.777
Okay.

08:32.779 --> 08:36.548
So I think this dead guy
is like really angry.

08:36.550 --> 08:39.017
He can jump into adults.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.553
Like, here's the thing.

08:41.555 --> 08:44.155
It's like you can't
like swallow,

08:44.157 --> 08:46.525
very hard to swallow
when he's in, you know,

08:46.527 --> 08:48.994
near or in you.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.331
You feel like you can't breathe,

08:53.333 --> 08:55.467
get lightheaded, and dizzy,

08:55.469 --> 08:58.937
um, and then compression
on the chest.

08:58.939 --> 09:03.708
And besides being sick,
it's also the rage.

09:05.077 --> 09:06.878
[Matthew]
Do you think that others

09:06.880 --> 09:08.780
might be in danger
because of this?

09:08.782 --> 09:10.448
Yes, I think so.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.083
Bad, bad, bad.

09:21.260 --> 09:24.262
[ominous music playing]

09:27.300 --> 09:30.302
[birds squawking]

09:38.611 --> 09:39.878
I'm more concerned
about you guys

09:39.880 --> 09:41.613
especially after talking
with your grandmother

09:41.615 --> 09:43.148
about what's going on here.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.616
Have you had experiences?

09:44.618 --> 09:45.850
Yes.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.953
One was actually in my
grandmother's room...

09:47.955 --> 09:50.322
<i>- [Steven] Okay.
- where I felt like I was being watched.</i>

09:50.324 --> 09:54.926
<i>And in the bathroom there was
a black shadow walking past.</i>

09:54.928 --> 09:56.628
So when you said you had
the feeling of being watched,

09:56.630 --> 10:00.865
did it feel like
it was just curiosity

10:00.867 --> 10:03.001
or did you feel like it was,
you know, creepy?

10:03.003 --> 10:04.736
Creepy.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.005
Any other experiences?

10:07.007 --> 10:08.573
Yes.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.308
One in my bedroom.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.710
<i>I was sleeping.</i>

10:11.712 --> 10:13.578
<i>I was having a nightmare
that I was being chased</i>

10:13.580 --> 10:14.679
<i>by a stranger.</i>

10:14.681 --> 10:16.948
When I had woken up,
I was being choked

10:16.950 --> 10:19.551
by what looked like the devil.

10:19.553 --> 10:22.187
And I couldn't breathe
and I couldn't move

10:22.189 --> 10:23.521
for a whole minute.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.523
You sure it wasn't part
of your dream?

10:25.525 --> 10:27.859
I'm sure. I was up

10:27.861 --> 10:30.195
and I could feel
his weight on me,

10:30.197 --> 10:31.830
and I felt his hands around me.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.665
And then after the whole minute,

10:33.667 --> 10:34.633
he disappeared.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.102
I thought I was gonna die.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.844
<i>[woman] I'm seeing
like a little girl.</i>

10:45.846 --> 10:46.811
<i>Something's happening.</i>

10:48.147 --> 10:49.080
I'm just hearing her.

10:49.082 --> 10:52.617
Oh, my God, did you see that?

10:52.619 --> 10:56.221
Oh, my God, did you see that?

10:56.223 --> 10:57.989
Like I'm wondering
if it's that guy,

10:57.991 --> 11:00.125
like the stalkery dude,

11:00.127 --> 11:01.893
because like I'm not seeing

11:01.895 --> 11:03.695
and I'm getting hit from behind.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.766
<i>It's not good.</i>

11:10.302 --> 11:11.436
<i>[Steve] Anything else?</i>

11:11.438 --> 11:14.239
Yes. Since we have moved
into this house,

11:14.241 --> 11:16.641
my health
has really gone downhill.

11:16.643 --> 11:17.876
Grandma mentioned that to me.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.911
So what are we talking about?

11:19.913 --> 11:23.948
My stomach has made it hard
for me to eat full meals.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.750
It makes it to where
I cannot stand up

11:25.752 --> 11:28.353
for more than five minutes.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.521
Have you gone to a doctor

11:29.523 --> 11:31.189
about what the hell
is going on with you?

11:31.191 --> 11:32.991
Yes, I have.

11:32.993 --> 11:38.029
They can't find anything wrong
with my stomach at all.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.065
Well, grandma thinks
this place is trying

11:40.067 --> 11:42.100
to kill you guys,
whatever's here.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.902
Do you feel that way?

11:43.904 --> 11:45.904
- Yes.
- Okay.

11:48.574 --> 11:50.141
<i>[woman] This one dead dude.</i>

11:50.143 --> 11:52.043
<i>He's definitely a jumper.</i>

11:52.045 --> 11:54.212
Oh, my God.

11:54.214 --> 11:58.616
[sighs] He's very irritating
though, this guy.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.385
[Matthew] Why?

12:00.387 --> 12:03.655
Because he, like, sits
in your stomach.

12:05.891 --> 12:09.961
<i>You can feel him
in your stomach.</i>

12:09.963 --> 12:13.064
<i>It's heavy and like it's sick.</i>

12:17.703 --> 12:19.704
[groaning]

12:22.374 --> 12:23.908
[Matthew] So did he just
jump you now?

12:26.145 --> 12:28.580
[woman] When he jumped
inside me, I got really dizzy,

12:28.582 --> 12:29.848
I couldn't breathe.

12:29.850 --> 12:33.151
[Matthew] So he has been
jumping you this whole time?

12:33.153 --> 12:34.285
Yeah.

12:36.822 --> 12:38.022
Hmm. Hmm.

12:46.632 --> 12:48.600
<i>[Steve] Well, Steven,
first off, I wanna extend</i>

12:48.602 --> 12:50.535
my condolences
on your father's passing.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.504
- [Steven] Yeah.
- What type of guy was he?

12:52.506 --> 12:56.074
He's the type of person
he'd give you his last dollar

12:56.076 --> 12:58.143
or the shirt off his back.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.310
I never see him smoke,

12:59.312 --> 13:02.080
I never seen him...
Hear him cuss.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.014
He never drank.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.082
You must miss him?

13:05.651 --> 13:06.985
Do you think he's here?

13:06.987 --> 13:09.621
Yes. He's watching
over the house.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.689
- I understand, you're what, 52?
- Yeah.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.892
- And you had a heart attack?
- [Steven] Yeah.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.127
In my feelings, you're a young
man to have a heart attack.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.462
Yeah, too young.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.297
So that brings me to a point.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.431
Monette was telling me about,

13:20.433 --> 13:23.201
everybody in the house
having some rage issues

13:23.203 --> 13:25.537
- actually, for lack of a better word.
- Yeah, anger issues.

13:25.539 --> 13:26.704
And particularly you as well.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.273
What's that all about?
What's going on?

13:28.275 --> 13:31.743
It just comes on
but I try to keep to myself.

13:31.745 --> 13:33.711
When you do get angry,
how angry do you get?

13:33.713 --> 13:35.446
I don't punch holes
in the walls anymore.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.581
Anymore?

13:36.583 --> 13:38.349
Yeah. I used to punch holes
in the walls

13:38.351 --> 13:39.450
a long time ago.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.586
The two of them does not know.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.555
Okay.

13:43.557 --> 13:46.157
[creaking]

13:46.159 --> 13:48.660
<i>[woman] Ooh, like a lot
of anger out here.</i>

13:51.931 --> 13:53.131
Lots of anger.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.732
This is coming from a male.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.267
I think he's alive.

13:57.570 --> 14:01.206
He's an extremely tense

14:01.208 --> 14:03.741
and stressed out person.

14:07.379 --> 14:10.081
It's an unusual amount of anger

14:10.083 --> 14:12.851
that he has about...

14:14.053 --> 14:15.353
his life situation.

14:16.822 --> 14:20.225
He feels like [bleep]
is just out of control

14:20.227 --> 14:22.727
in his life
and like going wrong.

14:22.729 --> 14:25.063
He's very scared

14:25.065 --> 14:27.232
and I see him like punching,

14:27.234 --> 14:28.466
like, punching something.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.136
<i>[Matthew] Do you have
any idea how violent</i>

14:32.138 --> 14:34.172
<i>this guy in the garage
might become</i>

14:34.174 --> 14:35.506
<i>if he was being jumped?</i>

14:35.508 --> 14:37.508
That would not be
a good situation.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.044
Do you think he might capable
of killing in that state.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.246
Yes.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.148
<i>[Steve] Anything else?</i>

14:44.150 --> 14:46.451
- I was shoved in my bedroom once.
- So what happened?

14:46.453 --> 14:49.053
You know, I just fell back
and put a big old hole

14:49.055 --> 14:51.990
<i>from my lower back in the wall.</i>

14:51.992 --> 14:53.291
So this ain't you punching holes

14:53.293 --> 14:54.325
- in the wall?
- Oh, no.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.760
And telling everybody else

14:55.762 --> 14:57.228
"You know what?
Something pushed me."

14:57.230 --> 14:58.329
No, no, no.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.797
I mean this is no joke.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.699
And you could've fell
the wrong way

15:01.701 --> 15:03.167
and I've seen
it a million times,

15:03.169 --> 15:04.903
people accidentally
break their neck

15:04.905 --> 15:06.604
on a simple little fall.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.374
With all the stuff
that's happening to you here,

15:09.376 --> 15:11.242
why don't you just pack
and get the hell out?

15:11.244 --> 15:13.177
Because I have
nowhere else to go.

15:17.349 --> 15:19.684
<i>[woman] I don't like this,
the creeper.</i>

15:19.686 --> 15:21.986
He is watching.

15:21.988 --> 15:23.321
Watching what?

15:23.323 --> 15:24.522
Whoever is in this room,

15:24.524 --> 15:26.824
I think he doesn't like them

15:26.826 --> 15:28.626
just standing there
and watching,

15:31.463 --> 15:32.497
like...

15:34.066 --> 15:36.968
he's like right here

15:36.970 --> 15:38.703
and he's got his knife.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.204
This makes me nervous.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.339
He wants to kill them.

15:43.909 --> 15:48.246
So that's not good.

16:00.693 --> 16:01.859
<i>[Steve] If you're looking
for lots of heat</i>

16:01.861 --> 16:03.194
<i>and open land,</i>

16:03.196 --> 16:05.096
<i>Victorville is the place
for you.</i>

16:05.098 --> 16:07.298
<i>I was worried I wouldn't
find much history here.</i>

16:07.300 --> 16:09.033
<i>But when I called
a local archivist,</i>

16:09.035 --> 16:11.669
<i>she said the Native American
tribe that lived here</i>

16:11.671 --> 16:13.338
<i>had a miserable time.</i>

16:13.340 --> 16:15.373
<i>But it wasn't the settlers
who drove them out.</i>

16:15.375 --> 16:16.841
<i>It was another tribe.</i>

16:24.116 --> 16:26.584
So Rebecca, I wanna thank you
for meeting me out here.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.053
All right, so who was
the tribe that lived here?

16:29.055 --> 16:30.955
Yeah. So they were called
the Serrano tribe

16:30.957 --> 16:34.559
and they had a village
in this area called Topapaibit

16:34.561 --> 16:36.995
and it extended
into your client's property.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.063
All right. So I got to think
at some point they came

16:39.065 --> 16:40.865
into contact
with settlers, right?

16:40.867 --> 16:42.900
Definitely, the Spanish
started arriving

16:42.902 --> 16:45.403
in the late 1700s.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.472
And since the Serrano
are a peaceful people,

16:47.474 --> 16:48.573
they actually helped them

16:48.575 --> 16:51.009
navigate the harsh
Mojave Desert early on.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.877
So how did the Spanish
treat the tribe?

16:52.879 --> 16:56.381
The Spanish saw the Serrano
as pagan and primitive.

16:56.383 --> 16:59.283
So they started trying to
convert them to Christianity

16:59.285 --> 17:01.352
- as soon as possible.
- Okay.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.221
Some were persuaded
pretty easily

17:03.223 --> 17:05.490
while others had to be forced
into it.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.358
Okay. So when you say forced
into it, what are we talking about?

17:07.360 --> 17:10.728
They use tactics like
starving them into submission.

17:10.730 --> 17:14.132
Essentially, they would destroy
their crops and their way of life.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.666
Now, Rebecca, you mentioned
on the phone to me

17:15.668 --> 17:18.936
that it wasn't the settlers
that drove the Serranos out,

17:18.938 --> 17:20.705
but it was another tribe,
who were they?

17:20.707 --> 17:23.174
So the Mojave tribe
also lived in this area.

17:23.176 --> 17:26.444
They saw the Serrano
as enabling the Spanish.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.312
They were disgusted
that so many of them

17:28.314 --> 17:30.014
had converted to Christianity

17:30.016 --> 17:31.416
and the Spanish way of life.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.551
Okay. So how exactly
did the Mojave

17:33.553 --> 17:34.952
get rid of the Serrano tribe?

17:34.954 --> 17:36.854
November of 1819,

17:36.856 --> 17:40.658
the Serrano in this area
got wind of a Mojave war party

17:40.660 --> 17:42.627
that was coming
through the area.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.963
So they actually abandoned
Topapaibit, their village,

17:45.965 --> 17:48.099
in hopes to avoid violence.

17:48.101 --> 17:51.035
But not all of them
escaped alive.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.136
All right, so what happened?

17:52.138 --> 17:54.372
So we know that
at least eight Serrano

17:54.374 --> 17:56.107
didn't make it out of this area.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.109
So Rebecca when I was
at my client's house,

17:58.111 --> 17:59.744
I noticed there's a lot
of tract housing

17:59.746 --> 18:01.112
<i>in the area.</i>

18:01.114 --> 18:03.181
Do you have any idea if
they've uncovered any bodies

18:03.183 --> 18:04.515
when they did the construction?

18:04.517 --> 18:06.651
Not when they were putting
your client's house up.

18:06.653 --> 18:10.188
But a rancher in the 1940s
was plowing his land

18:10.190 --> 18:13.157
and actually unearthed
26 Serrano skeletons

18:13.159 --> 18:16.127
and it was in the news.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.496
It was believed
that this mass burial site

18:18.498 --> 18:21.265
was actually a cemetery
for Topapaibit.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.934
How far is this
from my client's property?

18:22.936 --> 18:25.236
So there's a marker on site
there today.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.271
And it's about a mile
from your client's property.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.973
-[Steve] All right. So it's close.
-Yeah.

18:32.277 --> 18:36.547
There is a bit of negative
energy here.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.583
The sadness gets heavier.

18:38.585 --> 18:39.750
Sure, sure, Sure.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.320
Loss, loss, sad, sad.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.255
I'm like, is it [bleep] cursed?

18:49.161 --> 18:52.997
There are a handful
of dead people

18:52.999 --> 18:55.233
that are kind
of wandering around.

18:58.604 --> 19:00.605
I do think something
occurred here.

19:00.607 --> 19:04.142
There's something
with a curse, okay.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.110
And that's why things are bad.

19:08.447 --> 19:09.780
<i>[Steve] So far,
I've got a client</i>

19:09.782 --> 19:11.582
<i>who thinks the paranormal
killed her roommate</i>

19:11.584 --> 19:14.552
<i>on property near a
Native American burial site,</i>

19:14.554 --> 19:16.554
<i>but I wanna see
if there's anything else.</i>

19:16.556 --> 19:19.690
[dramatic music playing]

19:19.692 --> 19:21.159
<i>[Steve] Searching through
old records,</i>

19:21.161 --> 19:22.860
<i>I found the suicide
that took place</i>

19:22.862 --> 19:24.428
<i>right by Monet's house.</i>

19:24.430 --> 19:25.796
<i>Maybe it's just a coincidence,</i>

19:25.798 --> 19:28.633
<i>but this guy killed himself
at the age of 82,</i>

19:28.635 --> 19:31.102
<i>nearly the exact same age
as Monet's roommate</i>

19:31.104 --> 19:32.703
<i>when he died.</i>

19:32.705 --> 19:34.272
<i>In my experience, it's very rare</i>

19:34.274 --> 19:36.307
<i>for someone that age
to kill themselves.</i>

19:36.309 --> 19:37.808
<i>I'm on my way
to meet a historian</i>

19:37.810 --> 19:39.644
<i>to see if there's more
to this story.</i>

19:46.151 --> 19:48.553
<i>So Dylan I wanna thank you
for helping me out with this case.</i>

19:48.555 --> 19:50.321
So, the guy that killed
himself, who was he?

19:50.323 --> 19:53.491
Uh, that'll be Robert Turner.
Here's a photo of him.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.692
He was one of the key figures

19:54.694 --> 19:56.294
in putting Victorville
on the map.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.895
[Steve] I assume
he was married, kids?

19:57.897 --> 20:00.398
Yeah, yeah, six kids,
wife Susan.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.366
You said this guy helped
put the city on the map.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.234
How'd he do that?

20:03.236 --> 20:04.802
He was here at the right time.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.171
He started one of the first
large cattle ranches locally.

20:07.173 --> 20:10.074
And then he diversified
into businesses

20:10.076 --> 20:12.710
like a hotel,
a general store, and mining.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.479
He was the king of
the Victor Valley for a while.

20:15.481 --> 20:17.181
So it sounds like
this guy's making money.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.283
I mean, did he have
any shady deals going on?

20:19.285 --> 20:21.319
There is evidence
of land speculation

20:21.321 --> 20:23.221
and shady deals happening here

20:23.223 --> 20:25.523
because he was the guy
in charge,

20:25.525 --> 20:27.925
he pretty much named his price

20:27.927 --> 20:30.962
when selling lots
and selling ranch land

20:30.964 --> 20:32.964
- to people coming in.
- Okay.

20:32.966 --> 20:34.098
So it was his way
or the highway?

20:34.100 --> 20:35.199
- Yeah.
- All right.

20:35.201 --> 20:36.934
So, Dylan
with the shady dealings

20:36.936 --> 20:38.369
is that part of the reason
he kills himself?

20:38.371 --> 20:41.672
No. He started to experience
personal tragedies.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.274
He lost his youngest son,

20:43.276 --> 20:45.209
who was age four
to undisclosed causes.

20:45.211 --> 20:48.679
And then in 1899,
he lost another son.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.882
This is Frank and Frank
ran the general store.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.584
[Steve] How old was this guy
when he died?

20:53.586 --> 20:54.552
[Dylan] Frank was 24.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.187
Do we know what he died from?

20:56.189 --> 20:57.255
We don't know.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.656
That's a local mystery.

20:58.658 --> 21:02.493
The final blow was the loss
of his wife in 1912.

21:02.495 --> 21:03.828
[Steve]
Let's get to the suicide.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.029
I mean, what happened?

21:05.031 --> 21:07.531
[Dylan] So in 1916.
He's 82-years-old.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.200
He's living on
the family cattle ranch.

21:09.202 --> 21:12.136
This is about a mile
from your client's property.

21:12.138 --> 21:15.506
He takes this. 44 caliber
Winchester lever-action

21:15.508 --> 21:17.642
and he positions it
against the floor,

21:17.644 --> 21:18.843
the butt against the floor,

21:18.845 --> 21:20.378
and the muzzle of the gun
into his chest

21:20.380 --> 21:23.180
and discharges the firearm
into his body.

21:24.383 --> 21:25.883
[Steve] Eighty-two-years-old.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.618
You don't hear a lot of
82-year-olds committing suicide.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.953
When you're a man
of this character

21:28.955 --> 21:31.355
and you've done all of this
and you've built a city,

21:31.357 --> 21:33.424
decrepitude and old age,

21:33.426 --> 21:35.159
it may not be
the easiest thing to swallow.

21:35.161 --> 21:37.595
[ominous music playing]

21:39.665 --> 21:42.033
<i>[Amy] The creeper guy
keeps following me.</i>

21:43.969 --> 21:49.206
I'd put him maybe 1908.

21:49.208 --> 21:53.444
I think he was pretty bad,

21:53.446 --> 21:59.250
devious, like, scoundrel.

21:59.252 --> 22:01.652
I feel like he robbed people.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.854
[ominous music playing]

22:06.291 --> 22:09.560
Okay.
So I did just hear a gunshot.

22:09.562 --> 22:10.661
[Matthew] What's going on?

22:10.663 --> 22:12.396
I got a suicide.

22:14.766 --> 22:16.100
Pretty sure it was a man.

22:17.369 --> 22:18.869
I just feel really stressed out.

<i>[Steve] I was driving around
Monet's neighborhood</i>

22:47.266 --> 22:49.433
<i>and drove right by
a huge prison.</i>

22:49.435 --> 22:52.269
<i>Turns out the place
opened in 2004.</i>

22:52.271 --> 22:53.804

a lot of deaths</i>

meeting with me.</i>

23:11.357 --> 23:12.623
<i>So I got to ask you a question,</i>

23:12.625 --> 23:13.824
how did you wind up
in Victorville?

23:13.826 --> 23:15.760
I ended up there on a violation.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.763
My original case was, uh,
distribution of cocaine.

23:18.765 --> 23:19.797
- Okay.
- Went in,

23:19.799 --> 23:20.965
did my time, got out.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.367
And I was actually
at a pool party.

23:23.369 --> 23:24.802
Everybody was smoking weed.

23:24.804 --> 23:27.438
So I was, like, decided
to take a little hit off a joint.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.640
- Okay.
- Next day, my PO calls me.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.675
So I went in,
they arrested me right there

23:31.677 --> 23:32.843
and then in the office.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.111
So somebody dropped
a dime on you

23:34.113 --> 23:35.813
without a doubt. [laughs]

23:35.815 --> 23:37.081
I don't wanna think about it.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.983
But, man, I wouldn't put it
past nobody.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.918
So when you got there.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.153
I mean, you have been
in prison before.

23:42.155 --> 23:43.287
So I'm curious.

23:43.289 --> 23:44.622
What was your impression
when you walked in?

23:44.624 --> 23:45.956
I mean, I've been to prison
in Mexico.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.658
And I've seen some
pretty wild stuff.

23:47.660 --> 23:51.762
When I got there, uh,
the energy I felt is bad.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.898
So what kind of things did
you see when you were there?

23:53.900 --> 23:56.267
I mean, walking in the door.

23:56.269 --> 23:58.068
Somebody had already got killed.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.171
So as soon as we walked
into the kitchen,

24:00.173 --> 24:01.172
they were gonna feed us,

24:01.174 --> 24:03.908
there was blood
all over the wall.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.777
- Okay.
- On the floor, and handprints,

24:06.779 --> 24:09.413
bloody handprints
all over the wall.

24:09.415 --> 24:12.450
And, uh, I was like,
holy [bleep]

24:12.452 --> 24:14.752
like, what am I doing
back again?

24:14.754 --> 24:16.454
So you first day there and
this is what you're seeing?

24:16.456 --> 24:17.588
Yeah.

24:17.590 --> 24:18.856
I've heard it's been
called victim zone.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.791
- Yeah.
- I mean, I know the deal,

24:20.793 --> 24:22.693
been... I was on the job long
enough to know what goes on.

24:22.695 --> 24:26.130
But how did you survive
as far as tactically inside?

24:26.132 --> 24:27.932
Violence and knives, man.

24:27.934 --> 24:30.301
Do you know how many homicides

24:30.303 --> 24:32.570
that have been there
since it opened?

24:32.572 --> 24:34.271
- Total of eight.
- Okay.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.440
Any of those eight
stand out to you?

24:36.442 --> 24:40.044
In 2005,
a guy got stabbed to death

24:40.046 --> 24:42.012
over a couple bucks of tobacco.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.748
- Okay.
- People might say that

24:44.750 --> 24:47.651
that's like little,
but in there, it's a lot.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.087
Okay.
Anything else that stood out?

24:50.089 --> 24:52.289
In 2014 there was two cellmates

24:52.291 --> 24:55.693
that got killed in their cell.

24:55.695 --> 24:58.629
It was never really
pinned on nobody.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.064
They don't know who did it.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.632
I've heard of a lot
of homicides in jail,

25:01.634 --> 25:02.933
but it's the first time,
a double,

25:02.935 --> 25:04.768
- inside the same cell.
- Yeah.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.604
So I know a lot of things
haunt me.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.305
Does that prison
still haunt you?

25:08.307 --> 25:10.274
Sometimes, you know, I hadn't...

25:10.276 --> 25:12.376
I hadn't slept for 15 years.

25:12.378 --> 25:16.247
And, uh, I just barely
started sleeping

25:16.249 --> 25:17.515
a couple days ago.

25:17.517 --> 25:18.582
I'm glad to hear that.

25:18.584 --> 25:21.085
[ominous music playing]

25:21.087 --> 25:24.522
[Amy]
<i>I saw all of these people.</i>

25:24.524 --> 25:26.457
They'd stood up from the earth,

25:26.459 --> 25:29.059
and there was probably about 20.

25:29.061 --> 25:32.563
They are wanderers.

25:32.565 --> 25:35.633
<i>And they are looking for help.</i>

25:35.635 --> 25:37.835
And what I was told was that

25:37.837 --> 25:42.172
these were murder victims
who knew too much.

25:42.174 --> 25:45.209
But we're spanning like
several decades.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.711
[ominous music playing]

25:51.716 --> 25:54.318
<i>[Amy] I saw a lot of
disturbing things on my walk.</i>

25:54.320 --> 25:57.922
But the creeper
concerns me the most.

25:57.924 --> 26:00.157
<i>He has a hat on</i>

26:00.159 --> 26:02.493
and it's just kind of like
beat up.

26:02.495 --> 26:06.597
<i>He had tan skin,
dark hair to his neck.</i>

26:09.834 --> 26:11.302
His lips are rounded.

26:11.304 --> 26:13.904
There's no points
or anything very rounded.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.274
<i>Next, I described the creeper</i>

26:17.276 --> 26:20.077
jumping a living man
in the garage.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.980
I wanna show like the dead guy,

26:22.982 --> 26:28.986
like, going into the stomach
of this living guy.

26:28.988 --> 26:32.289
<i>I want to show his face enraged.</i>

26:32.291 --> 26:34.658
Because that's what this guy,

26:34.660 --> 26:38.228
like, brings out in him, rage.

26:40.131 --> 26:43.200
Amy, is this what you saw?

26:43.202 --> 26:44.768
Yes, that's what I saw.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.338
[ominous music playing]

26:51.610 --> 26:53.944
[ominous music playing]

27:05.156 --> 27:07.825
<i>[Steve] Now that Amy and I
have completed our investigations,</i>

27:07.827 --> 27:10.494
<i>we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other</i>

27:10.496 --> 27:13.030
<i>and our clients
for the first time.</i>

27:13.032 --> 27:15.065
Guys, I'd like you to meet Amy,

27:15.067 --> 27:17.101
she's gonna be doing
the reveal from another room

27:17.103 --> 27:19.003
so she can concentrate
on your case

27:19.005 --> 27:21.505
as well as the dead
without any distractions.

27:21.507 --> 27:23.073
Amy, I want you to meet
the three people

27:23.075 --> 27:24.041
who live in this house.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.175
This is Monette.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.477
She's the one that called us in.

27:26.479 --> 27:29.513
This is her granddaughter
Paije who's 20.

27:29.515 --> 27:32.216
And this is Steven,
who is a family friend

27:32.218 --> 27:34.018
and the co-owner of the house.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.520
Monette and Paije are terrified

27:36.522 --> 27:42.359
and think that whatever's here
is evil and wants to kill.

27:42.361 --> 27:44.862
So, unless Amy's got
some questions for you guys,

27:44.864 --> 27:46.563
uh, she'll tell us
about her walk.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.534
When I first got here,

27:50.536 --> 27:56.273
the feelings that I got
were extreme sadness,

27:56.275 --> 27:59.777
and that just kind of
permeates this area,

27:59.779 --> 28:02.746
which indicated to me that
there had been

28:02.748 --> 28:05.883
some type of substantial loss.

28:05.885 --> 28:09.253
The living here may be prone

28:09.255 --> 28:14.024
to having depressive episodes
and feeling lost.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.794
I've never actually been one
to be depressed.

28:16.796 --> 28:20.130
But I have been
since I moved here.

28:21.766 --> 28:23.233
It's probably a shot
in the dark,

28:23.235 --> 28:25.569
but there's something you
probably should know about,

28:25.571 --> 28:27.171
that came up from research.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.772
This land was originally settled

28:28.774 --> 28:30.808
by the Serrano Indians.

28:30.810 --> 28:35.112
Now their village
actually extended

28:35.114 --> 28:36.714
to your property here.

28:36.716 --> 28:39.183
In 1700s,
the Spanish settlers came,

28:39.185 --> 28:41.351
they saw that tribe
as being primitive

28:41.353 --> 28:43.854
and started converting them
to Christianity.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.923
Anyone who resisted
was tortured.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.257
Oh.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.526
So eventually they got driven
out of this area,

28:49.528 --> 28:51.662
but not by the Spanish settlers

28:51.664 --> 28:53.897
by the neighboring Mojave tribe.

28:53.899 --> 28:57.101
Now in 1940, a local farmer
was plowing his land,

28:57.103 --> 28:58.635
about a mile from here.

28:58.637 --> 29:01.171
He stumbled onto
a Serrano burial site,

29:01.173 --> 29:03.674
and there was remains
of 26 people.

29:03.676 --> 29:05.676
Now I got a photo of it.

29:07.345 --> 29:09.379
It's kind of sad to look at.

29:09.381 --> 29:12.282
Now do you think the sadness
might've came from this tribe?

29:12.284 --> 29:13.484
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.123
[Steve] So what else?

29:19.125 --> 29:22.993
What I feel is
affecting you the most

29:22.995 --> 29:24.762
and is the biggest problem here,

29:24.764 --> 29:27.464
there is one very conscious,

29:27.466 --> 29:31.101
pretty dangerous dead guy
who is here.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.336
I called him the creeper

29:32.338 --> 29:35.939
because he likes
to watch people.

29:35.941 --> 29:39.109
He likes to get right up on you,

29:39.111 --> 29:41.812
like, almost to where
he's at your back

29:41.814 --> 29:44.214
and, like, his face
is right here.

29:44.216 --> 29:47.484
One time when I was
in my grandma's room,

29:47.486 --> 29:49.586
I felt like I was being watched.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.789
And then out of nowhere,
there was a shadow

29:51.791 --> 29:55.993
in my grandma's room
walking past the doorway.

29:55.995 --> 29:58.028
And there was no way it was
coming from the outside, correct?

29:58.030 --> 30:00.063
No.

30:00.065 --> 30:03.567
His thing, you know,
he loves to steal things.

30:03.569 --> 30:07.104
Something as stupid
as, like, he would take,

30:07.106 --> 30:09.206
you know, a remote control.

30:09.208 --> 30:12.609
And, like, hide it
for like a week.

30:12.611 --> 30:17.815
And then you would find it
exactly where you put it.

30:17.817 --> 30:19.917
Wow. It's pretty amazing.

30:19.919 --> 30:22.352
Sadly, it's exactly
like she said,

30:22.354 --> 30:25.055
I'll have my keys
sitting on my bed.

30:25.057 --> 30:27.891
And I'll go wash my hands
or brush my teeth,

30:27.893 --> 30:29.927
come back,
the keys are absolutely gone.

30:29.929 --> 30:32.095
I go to look for a spare,
and there they are

30:32.097 --> 30:34.631
sitting in the exact same spot.

30:34.633 --> 30:38.202
So absolutely irritating
beyond belief.

30:38.204 --> 30:39.636
Any idea who this guy
might have been

30:39.638 --> 30:41.004
when he was alive?

30:41.006 --> 30:43.240
[Amy] He was from way back.

30:43.242 --> 30:46.677
I kept hearing 1908
for some reason,

30:46.679 --> 30:49.813
definitely got the impression
that he wasn't a great guy

30:49.815 --> 30:51.148
when he was alive.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.016
He liked to rob people.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.118
I just got that
he was a scoundrel

30:55.120 --> 30:58.055
and that he was very devious.

30:58.057 --> 31:00.123
So I think he was just
a criminal.

31:00.125 --> 31:03.227
He also loves knives.

31:03.229 --> 31:06.597
He's obsessed with them.

31:06.599 --> 31:09.333
His death was not great.

31:09.335 --> 31:11.768
It was something like choking.

31:11.770 --> 31:15.339
- He couldn't breathe.
- Okay.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.875
I mean, it's... For me,
it's not a lot to go on.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.343
But one of the things
you were saying

31:19.345 --> 31:21.111
especially the 1908 plot,

31:21.113 --> 31:23.413
had me thinking
of one of the city's

31:23.415 --> 31:24.781
founding fathers.

31:24.783 --> 31:26.183
His name was Robert Turner.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.318
And he came here from
Pennsylvania in the 1860s.

31:28.320 --> 31:31.321
Robert built a very successful
cattle ranch

31:31.323 --> 31:32.956
less than a mile
from your house here.

31:32.958 --> 31:35.392
But according to the expert
I spoke to,

31:35.394 --> 31:36.994
he wasn't that good of a guy.

31:36.996 --> 31:39.129
He made some shady deals,

31:39.131 --> 31:41.732
but he also suffered
from some personal tragedies.

31:41.734 --> 31:44.668
He lost his four-year-old son
in 1881

31:44.670 --> 31:47.671
after that happened,
his 24-year-old son

31:47.673 --> 31:51.642
dropped dead
of unknown causes in 1899.

31:51.644 --> 31:53.010
I got a picture of the son.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.782
Now the biggest blow
to this guy came in 1912

31:58.784 --> 32:01.385
when Turner's wife died
after an illness.

32:01.387 --> 32:03.353
Now this was all too much
for Turner.

32:03.355 --> 32:08.659
In 1916, he took a. 44 rifle,

32:08.661 --> 32:10.160
put it against his body,

32:10.162 --> 32:13.230
basically in his chest,
blew his chest out.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.765
Now, I've seen
what a. 44 rifle

32:14.767 --> 32:16.733
could do to somebody that close,

32:16.735 --> 32:18.168
it must have been a mess.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.671
Now I got a photo of this guy.

32:20.673 --> 32:22.940
Was there any way that
this guy could be the creeper?

32:22.942 --> 32:26.910
I had a sketch of the person
I encountered.

32:26.912 --> 32:29.379
[tense music playing]

32:34.152 --> 32:36.620
Oh, yeah, this looks
nothing like the two guys

32:36.622 --> 32:38.055
I just showed you.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.490
He's a miserable looking
son of a bitch, isn't he?

32:42.226 --> 32:43.193
[Steven] Wow.

32:44.495 --> 32:47.631
- [Paije] Very scary.
- [Monette] It's creepy.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.333
[Steve] You know,
this was a ranch years ago.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.001
This place is filled
with cowboys and stuff

32:51.003 --> 32:53.103
and this... Could this guy
have been maybe a ranch hand

32:53.105 --> 32:54.938
that was a drifter
that came through?

32:54.940 --> 32:57.107
That could be. Yeah.

32:57.109 --> 32:59.209
Okay, So we don't know
who this creeper guy is,

32:59.211 --> 33:00.844
but you did say
he was dangerous.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.079
So what does he do?

33:02.081 --> 33:06.883
He can jump into
the body of living people.

33:06.885 --> 33:08.919
He did it to me during the walk.

33:08.921 --> 33:11.355
[ominous music playing]

33:17.261 --> 33:18.695
[Matthew] So did he just
jump you now?

33:20.999 --> 33:24.701
I felt sick, dizzy,
couldn't breathe.

33:24.703 --> 33:29.339
And I felt like
I couldn't swallow.

33:29.341 --> 33:32.409
This is something that the
living here could experience.

33:34.612 --> 33:36.013
Are you okay, sweetie?

33:36.015 --> 33:38.815
- Can I...
- [Steve] Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

33:43.988 --> 33:45.255
You okay?

33:47.859 --> 33:49.292
- [Monette] Love bug.
- [Paije] Yeah.

33:49.294 --> 33:51.228
- [Monette] Are you okay?
- [Paije] Yeah.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.929
[Monette speaking]

33:52.931 --> 33:54.431
[Paije speaking

33:54.433 --> 33:59.302
[Monette speaking]

33:59.304 --> 34:01.905
[Paije speaking]

34:01.907 --> 34:05.275
- [Monette speaking]
- [Paije speaking]

34:05.277 --> 34:07.511
[Monette speaking]

34:08.679 --> 34:11.581
- You okay?
- Yeah.

34:11.583 --> 34:14.251
- [Steve] You okay, sweetie?
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

34:16.220 --> 34:19.289
Paije, when you see that
what's going through your mind?

34:19.291 --> 34:23.393
One night,
I was having a nightmare.

34:23.395 --> 34:27.264
And it was a stranger
that was choking me.

34:27.266 --> 34:28.765
When I had woken up,

34:28.767 --> 34:31.234
this stranger had turned
into the devil.

34:31.236 --> 34:34.538
And I couldn't breathe
for a good minute.

34:34.540 --> 34:37.074
I felt his weight
on top of my chest.

34:37.076 --> 34:39.209
And he was just
sitting on top of me,

34:39.211 --> 34:41.478
choking me and laughing at me.

34:41.480 --> 34:45.482
And then after one minute,
he disappeared.

34:45.484 --> 34:47.617
Come here. Listen to me.
Listen to me.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.252
It's gonna be okay, all right?

34:49.254 --> 34:51.955
I'm not going anywhere.
Nobody's gonna leave here.

34:51.957 --> 34:54.825
We're gonna find out what
the hell to do with this guy.

34:54.827 --> 34:56.159
I'm gonna get rid of him, okay?

34:56.161 --> 34:57.227
- [Paije] Okay.
- [Steve] All right.

34:57.229 --> 34:59.496
Can I get your jacket, grandma?

34:59.498 --> 35:02.933
So I could get this cold
off of me?

35:02.935 --> 35:04.734
- [Steve] Yeah, sure.
- [Monette] Yeah.

35:04.736 --> 35:07.037
- Is that better? Felt better?
- Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

35:07.039 --> 35:10.140
So talking about being choked.
You had the same...

35:10.142 --> 35:11.575
Something similar
happened to you?

35:11.577 --> 35:17.380
Yes, I woke up and it felt
as though fingers had squeezed

35:17.382 --> 35:19.416
- the inside of my throat shut.
- Mmm-hmm.

35:19.418 --> 35:20.584
I don't know how long it was,

35:20.586 --> 35:22.219
but to me,
it was like an eternity.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.754
Super scary,
and I thought that was it.

35:24.756 --> 35:28.592
It's a possibility
that you were experiencing

35:28.594 --> 35:32.629
what he went through
when he died.

35:32.631 --> 35:36.833
Another thing about this guy,
he can make you very sick.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.135
When he jumped me,

35:38.137 --> 35:40.770
I felt this like weight
in my stomach.

35:40.772 --> 35:43.073
And, like,
it was so uncomfortable.

35:43.075 --> 35:46.009
You should know that
everybody here

35:46.011 --> 35:47.677
has health issues
and they're sick

35:47.679 --> 35:49.980
and they blame it all
on the paranormal.

35:49.982 --> 35:52.315
Start with you, Paije.
You told me all about that.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.317
I get a lot of pain
in my stomach

35:54.319 --> 35:56.820
to where I just lay in bed
all day.

35:56.822 --> 35:59.289
I'm usually cranky
when it happens.

35:59.291 --> 36:02.225
You've had issues before.

36:02.227 --> 36:04.227
She's a brain cancer survivor.

36:04.229 --> 36:07.197
She's still being checked
every so often.

36:07.199 --> 36:09.132
Yes, but they haven't found

36:09.134 --> 36:11.668
anything wrong with my stomach.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.838
It's been three years
and still nothing on it.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.540
Now, Monette,
you got health issues?

36:16.542 --> 36:19.309
Right now,
I have broken bones in my feet

36:19.311 --> 36:22.612
and my ankles that I knew
nothing about nor how I got them.

36:23.648 --> 36:24.981
Yeah, I've had a heart attack

36:24.983 --> 36:28.118
and didn't know I had one and...

36:28.120 --> 36:30.287
- You're only 52.
- Yeah.

36:30.289 --> 36:32.022
Amy, there's something else
you should know.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.623
Steven's dad
died of a heart attack

36:33.625 --> 36:34.958
when he lived here.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.526
So I'm gonna tell Amy
why you think

36:36.528 --> 36:38.628
it's the paranormal
that killed him.

36:38.630 --> 36:41.264
Because this man never smoked,
or drank,

36:41.266 --> 36:44.401
and he was a Christian man,
very godly man.

36:44.403 --> 36:46.102
[Steve] This is a picture
of him right here.

36:46.104 --> 36:47.370
[Monette] Yes.

36:47.372 --> 36:49.272
[Steve] Steven thinks
he's still here.

36:49.274 --> 36:52.008
What do you think, Amy?

36:52.010 --> 36:55.712
I don't think he's here
anymore, which is great.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.814
That's awesome.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.583
You feel better that
your dad's moved on?

36:59.585 --> 37:00.617
Yeah.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.252
He had a one way ticket
to heaven.

37:02.254 --> 37:04.854
[ominous music playing]

37:04.856 --> 37:06.890
[Steve]
<i>So, Amy, this dead guy,</i>

37:06.892 --> 37:08.625
<i>does he do anything else?</i>

37:08.627 --> 37:10.660
When he jumps people,

37:10.662 --> 37:13.296
he will heighten their emotions.

37:13.298 --> 37:14.965
So if you're prone to anger,

37:14.967 --> 37:17.200
or if you're prone to sadness,
or whatever,

37:17.202 --> 37:19.069
he'll make that tenfold.

37:19.071 --> 37:22.138
I saw an incident in the garage

37:22.140 --> 37:25.542
where this person,
this male, was so angry

37:25.544 --> 37:28.178
and very upset
about his life situation.

37:28.180 --> 37:32.349
And he was thinking that
he was cursed or something

37:32.351 --> 37:34.985
because things were always
going so bad.

37:34.987 --> 37:38.021
And I saw the dead guy
jump into him.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.656
But I did have
a sketch done of this.

37:39.658 --> 37:42.225
[ominous music playing]

37:52.270 --> 37:53.169
[Steven] Oh, jeez.

37:55.973 --> 37:58.108
[Paije] It looks like Steven.

37:58.110 --> 38:01.378
[Monette]
Makes perfect sense to me.

38:01.380 --> 38:04.481
That is amazing.

38:04.483 --> 38:06.516
Do you recall ever
being in the garage

38:06.518 --> 38:09.386
and getting mental like that?

38:09.388 --> 38:11.354
Yeah, that's... Yeah.

38:11.356 --> 38:14.858
My fear is that

38:14.860 --> 38:18.194
if you jumped a living person
who was in a state,

38:18.196 --> 38:20.163
he could make that
person violent.

38:20.165 --> 38:22.666
He might be able to make that
person kill someone.

38:22.668 --> 38:25.101
[ominous music playing]

38:26.704 --> 38:29.706
Now that makes me
extremely concerned.

38:29.708 --> 38:32.509
I feel very uncomfortable.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.244
That explains a lot to me.

38:34.246 --> 38:36.880
And that actually pisses me off.

38:36.882 --> 38:37.781
Very scary.

38:37.783 --> 38:40.283
[ominous music playing]

38:47.992 --> 38:50.393
[ominous music playing]

38:54.598 --> 38:57.600
[Steve] So you guys thought
you had a demon in the house.

38:57.602 --> 38:59.502
Good news is you don't.

38:59.504 --> 39:02.205
Bad news is this creeper guy

39:02.207 --> 39:04.274
might as well have been a demon.

39:04.276 --> 39:07.143
Now the question is can
you get rid of this [bleep]

39:07.145 --> 39:08.745
and get back to a normal life?

39:08.747 --> 39:11.448
And if so,
what's that gonna take?

39:11.450 --> 39:13.049
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:13.051 --> 39:16.886
[ominous music playing]

39:16.888 --> 39:20.256
So there's, like, good news
and then there's bad news.

39:22.626 --> 39:26.596
As far as the dead guy
is concerned,

39:26.598 --> 39:30.533
there is something that
can be done

39:30.535 --> 39:35.739
to get rid of him
by people, a team,

39:35.741 --> 39:38.241
that I would be putting together

39:38.243 --> 39:39.943
would come here.

39:39.945 --> 39:42.746
They're kind of
a mixed bag of people,

39:42.748 --> 39:45.915
psychics, mediums,
pagans, Satanists,

39:45.917 --> 39:47.784
you know, the whole nine.

39:47.786 --> 39:50.920
The first thing
that they would do is

39:50.922 --> 39:56.393
what's called a cord cutting
between you guys and him.

39:56.395 --> 40:03.066
Then a shaman
will actually be removing him,

40:03.068 --> 40:05.835
the dead guy,
from this situation.

40:07.338 --> 40:11.207
The bad news is that this area

40:11.209 --> 40:16.413
is really, really, really thick

40:16.415 --> 40:20.316
with this awful residual energy.

40:20.318 --> 40:24.988
The problem is, is that...

40:24.990 --> 40:27.157
you can't get rid of this.

40:29.794 --> 40:32.228
So in order for you
to stay here,

40:32.230 --> 40:37.600
you would literally have to
do cleansings of your home,

40:37.602 --> 40:41.137
and this would have
to be something you did

40:41.139 --> 40:44.574
pretty much on a daily basis.

40:44.576 --> 40:45.809
It's up to you.

40:45.811 --> 40:48.812
If that's something
you want to take on.

40:50.848 --> 40:54.017
Her bad news was just as good
as her good news for me.

40:54.019 --> 40:56.453
[laughs] Okay. Good.

40:56.455 --> 41:00.557
A billion pounds lifted off
my shoulders right now.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.225
Oh, good.

41:02.227 --> 41:04.427
Paije, you feel better about it?

41:04.429 --> 41:06.796
Yes. I do.

41:06.798 --> 41:10.900
We could get all the negative
and depression out.

41:10.902 --> 41:12.202
Great.

41:12.204 --> 41:15.004
- How about you, big guy?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

41:15.006 --> 41:17.841
Get this, you know,
evil out of here.

41:17.843 --> 41:19.409
I'm feeling really blessed

41:19.411 --> 41:22.312
and ready to get back to normal.

41:22.314 --> 41:24.447
Yes, I'm looking forward
to you guys

41:24.449 --> 41:26.449
getting back to that.

41:26.451 --> 41:28.551
- I feel lighter.
- [Steve] Good.

41:28.553 --> 41:29.886
I really do.

41:31.355 --> 41:34.958
<i>Monette, Paije, and Steven
have suffered long enough.</i>

41:34.960 --> 41:37.026
<i>I really hope
they follow my advice</i>

41:37.028 --> 41:39.729
and cleanse their house
of negative energy,

41:39.731 --> 41:42.999
as well as work with a shaman
to remove the creeper.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.934
If they do, I'm confident

41:44.936 --> 41:46.970
they can live in
their home peacefully

41:46.972 --> 41:49.005
for many years to come.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.441
