00:36.200 --> 00:37.265
Hey!

00:37.300 --> 00:39.534
Check the bathroom!

00:59.033 --> 01:00.365
Ahh.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.466
You wanna know
how big my balls are?

01:02.501 --> 01:04.934
My balls are bigger
than two of your heads

01:04.968 --> 01:07.232
duct-taped together.

01:07.267 --> 01:08.666
I've been
in the middle of shit

01:08.701 --> 01:11.634
that would make you
piss your pants right now.

01:11.669 --> 01:14.334
Uptown, Downtown,
Harlem, Brooklyn.

01:14.369 --> 01:15.668
But there
ain't no medals

01:15.703 --> 01:17.118
on my chest,
assholes,

01:17.153 --> 01:18.534
because
I ain't no hero.

01:18.569 --> 01:19.599
I'm a fireman.

01:19.634 --> 01:20.900
We're not
in the business

01:20.935 --> 01:22.132
of making heroes here.

01:22.167 --> 01:24.167
We're in the business
of discovering cowards,

01:24.202 --> 01:25.585
because that's
what you are

01:25.620 --> 01:26.968
if you can't
take the heat.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.098
You're a pussy,

01:28.133 --> 01:29.534
and there ain't
no room for pussies

01:29.569 --> 01:31.234
in the FDNY.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.267
What are you laughing at,
shit head?

01:35.302 --> 01:36.232
Huh?

01:36.267 --> 01:38.167
What's so goddamn funny?

01:38.202 --> 01:39.899
- I just--
- Shut up!

01:39.934 --> 01:42.000
You speak when spoken to.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.432
You pussies better pray

01:46.467 --> 01:49.100
you don't get assigned
to my firehouse

01:49.135 --> 01:51.901
because I have seen it all.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.265
I knew 60 men

01:55.300 --> 01:58.634
who gave their lives
at Ground Zero.

01:58.669 --> 02:01.399
Sixty.

02:01.434 --> 02:04.667
Four of them from my house.

02:07.033 --> 02:09.199
Vito Costello.

02:09.234 --> 02:12.634
Found him almost whole.

02:12.669 --> 02:14.632
Ricky Davis.

02:14.667 --> 02:19.801
Found him almost whole,
hugging a civilian woman.

02:19.836 --> 02:22.301
Bobby Vincent.

02:22.336 --> 02:24.734
Found his head.

02:24.769 --> 02:27.135
And my cousin...

02:27.170 --> 02:29.335
Jimmy Keefe,

02:29.370 --> 02:31.466
my best friend.

02:31.501 --> 02:35.666
You know what they found of him?

02:35.701 --> 02:39.400
What I was able to bring back,
give to his parents?

02:41.100 --> 02:42.933
A finger.

02:42.968 --> 02:45.601
That's all.

02:45.636 --> 02:48.199
A finger.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.866
These four men

02:49.901 --> 02:52.033
were better human beings
and better firefighters

02:52.068 --> 02:54.934
than any of you will ever be.

03:00.701 --> 03:03.098
Say thank you,
firefighting upper class!

03:03.133 --> 03:06.400
Thank you,
firefighting captain, sir!

03:11.467 --> 03:12.599
Hey, cuz.

03:12.634 --> 03:14.067
That was nice.

03:14.102 --> 03:15.367
It was.

03:17.000 --> 03:17.965
It was real nice

03:18.000 --> 03:19.467
what you said about me
back there.

03:19.502 --> 03:20.934
It was nice.
I-I liked the sentiment.

03:23.033 --> 03:25.083
Those probies wouldn't think
you were such a tough guy

03:25.118 --> 03:27.133
if they knew you were talking
to a dead guy, but...

03:29.901 --> 03:32.032
Nothing to say?

03:32.067 --> 03:33.200
You're not
talking to me.

03:33.235 --> 03:34.732
Okay.

03:34.767 --> 03:36.567
So, what do you
wanna do?

03:36.602 --> 03:37.666
You wanna go home?

03:37.701 --> 03:39.050
You wanna go
to the cemetery,

03:39.085 --> 03:40.400
look at my headstone
again?

03:42.334 --> 03:43.467
You know what, Jimmy?

03:44.734 --> 03:46.067
Asshole.

03:53.859 --> 03:57.059
GUTS

04:36.767 --> 04:37.767
Hey, Tommy.

04:37.802 --> 04:38.732
Hey.

04:38.767 --> 04:40.367
You know, we get
our new probie today.

04:40.402 --> 04:41.484
You know
what that means.

04:41.519 --> 04:42.876
Time to bust some balls, baby.

04:42.911 --> 04:44.289
We should do
the first gag--

04:44.324 --> 04:45.695
Gavin, you owe
the city a tour,

04:45.730 --> 04:47.032
and if you don't make it up,

04:47.067 --> 04:48.868
I'm gonna suspend your mutuals
for 30 days.

04:48.903 --> 04:50.132
I'll take care of it, Chief.

04:50.167 --> 04:51.567
Some time this year
would be nice.

04:51.602 --> 04:52.666
Hey, Garrity,

04:52.701 --> 04:54.100
there's a box
next to my desk.

04:54.135 --> 04:55.300
Bring it out to the car.

04:55.335 --> 04:56.632
A box?

04:56.667 --> 04:58.868
I don't have time to explain
what a box is, retard.

04:58.903 --> 05:00.132
Just do it.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.501
The Grinch rides again.

05:01.536 --> 05:02.585
I heard that.

05:02.620 --> 05:03.634
It wasn't me.

05:03.669 --> 05:04.651
Asshole.

05:04.686 --> 05:05.599
Prick.

05:05.634 --> 05:06.599
If the city sends

05:06.634 --> 05:07.833
one of those shrinks
over here,

05:07.897 --> 05:10.039
I'm gonna tell them Chief Perolli
touched me in the shower.

05:10.085 --> 05:10.998
That'll
fix the bastard.

05:11.033 --> 05:12.433
What are you
talking about, shrinks?

05:12.471 --> 05:14.398
Yeah, my buddy Victor
over at Engine 2.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.164
Said the city sent a shrink to
talk to the guys.

05:16.181 --> 05:17.668
- Christ. That's helpful.
- It's a joke.

05:17.702 --> 05:18.833
Know what I'm gonna do?

05:18.868 --> 05:20.868
They send a shrink here,
I'm gonna kick his ass.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.868
Yeah, that'll raise
a red flag at headquarters.

05:22.903 --> 05:24.065
Yeah.

05:24.100 --> 05:25.199
Hey, bro, um...

05:25.234 --> 05:27.100
my soon-to-be ex
has a date tonight,

05:27.135 --> 05:28.418
so I need someone
to switch.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.776
Oh, I can't help you, bro.

05:29.811 --> 05:31.065
I got a thing tonight,

05:31.101 --> 05:33.267
and it better turn out better
than the thing last night.

05:33.296 --> 05:34.689
Remember that chick
with the friend?

05:34.719 --> 05:36.458
- Was that last night?
- Goddamn disgraceful.

05:36.498 --> 05:37.894
The chick,
I don't remember her name,

05:37.952 --> 05:39.557
she never shows,
so it's me and the friend.

05:39.592 --> 05:41.790
Friend has a face like my ass,
only my ass ain't as hairy.

05:41.836 --> 05:42.866
She had a hairy face?

05:42.901 --> 05:44.032
Well, not
obviously hairy,

05:44.067 --> 05:46.133
but when she turned her head,
you could see...

05:46.168 --> 05:47.901
I don't know,
it was like sideburns.

05:47.936 --> 05:49.334
- Very faint.
- Sideburns?

05:49.369 --> 05:50.368
Chick sideburns.

05:50.403 --> 05:51.367
That's not a box.

05:51.402 --> 05:52.399
Shit.

05:52.434 --> 05:54.600
So I buy her dinner,
a ton of drinks.

05:54.635 --> 05:56.767
It's getting late,
so I make my move.

05:56.802 --> 05:58.766
Get this, she shuns me.

05:58.801 --> 06:00.466
- She shuns you?
- Blows me off.

06:00.501 --> 06:02.300
Leaves in a huff.
Do you believe this shit?

06:02.335 --> 06:03.499
What I can't believe

06:03.534 --> 06:05.601
is you making a move
on a chick with sideburns.

06:05.636 --> 06:06.666
Hey, Tommy,

06:06.701 --> 06:07.933
it's getting slow out there,
pal.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.100
All that pussy I was getting
after 9/11, now nothing.

06:10.135 --> 06:11.065
People forget.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.901
Yeah. Sad commentary.

06:19.701 --> 06:21.098
Hey.

06:21.133 --> 06:22.234
What's the plan, man?

06:23.467 --> 06:25.400
- Hey.
- You catch that Giant game?

06:25.435 --> 06:26.484
Oh, Jesus, no.

06:26.519 --> 06:27.499
I heard, though.

06:27.534 --> 06:28.833
Got the ball on
the four-yard line,

06:28.868 --> 06:30.133
and they couldn't
put it across.

06:30.168 --> 06:31.098
Unbelievable.

06:31.133 --> 06:32.333
Four yards,
and I cash huge.

06:32.368 --> 06:33.534
You know
what I'm gonna do

06:33.569 --> 06:34.566
- to those guys?
- What?

06:34.601 --> 06:36.384
- Those steroid-infected pricks?
- What?

06:36.419 --> 06:38.209
I'm gonna find out
where they live,

06:38.244 --> 06:40.122
and I'm gonna
set their houses on fire.

06:40.157 --> 06:42.000
And then when they
ask me to put it out,

06:42.035 --> 06:43.199
I'm gonna say, "I'm sorry, guys,

06:43.234 --> 06:45.634
but I only brought
four yards of goddamn hose."

06:45.669 --> 06:46.699
They're killing me.

06:46.734 --> 06:48.767
Hey, uh, Chief Perolli
said that we--

06:48.802 --> 06:50.232
You tell Chief Perolli

06:50.267 --> 06:52.965
to kiss my fat,
white Irish ass.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.567
Anything he tells you to do,
do the exact opposite,

06:55.602 --> 06:56.567
and use my name.

06:56.602 --> 06:58.065
I figured.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.501
Hey, Janet's got a date tonight,
so I need somebody to, uh--

07:00.536 --> 07:01.768
Yeah, yeah, I heard.

07:01.803 --> 07:03.000
Tough, Tommy, huh?

07:03.035 --> 07:04.632
Yes.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.467
Look, what're the odds
of you guys actually...

07:06.502 --> 07:08.399
you know, breaking up?

07:08.434 --> 07:11.033
There's a pool on my divorce?

07:11.068 --> 07:12.367
No.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.466
Yeah.

07:15.501 --> 07:16.901
Look, I'll give you
the tour off.

07:16.936 --> 07:17.998
Give me the odds.

07:18.033 --> 07:21.167
I'd say 60-40 divorce right now.

07:21.202 --> 07:22.399
Yeah!

07:22.434 --> 07:24.584
I-I'm sorry, Tom.

07:24.619 --> 07:26.734
Uh... thanks, brother.

07:43.847 --> 07:44.945
Goddamn it.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.274
Jesus, what are you
sneaking around

07:46.302 --> 07:47.232
like that for?

07:47.267 --> 07:48.699
Tommy, it's Lou.
I just saw him.

07:48.734 --> 07:50.967
He's in the kitchen,
and he's-- He's crying.

07:51.002 --> 07:53.200
- What?
- I swear to God on my mother's grave.

07:53.235 --> 07:54.933
Your mother's
still alive, Sean.

07:54.968 --> 07:56.767
Well, no, I meant, you know,
when she dies.

07:56.802 --> 07:58.501
God forbid. Knock on wood.

07:58.536 --> 07:59.833
Shit.

07:59.868 --> 08:01.501
Uh, all right,
my father's grave. How's that?

08:01.536 --> 08:02.599
Your dad's dead?

08:02.634 --> 08:04.467
Yeah, oh, yeah,
years ago. Ass cancer.

08:04.502 --> 08:05.432
Ass cancer?

08:05.467 --> 08:06.801
Yeah, you know,
postrate.

08:08.434 --> 08:09.399
Yeah.

08:09.434 --> 08:10.334
Sorry, bro.

08:11.901 --> 08:13.467
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah.

08:13.502 --> 08:14.601
What's going on?

08:14.636 --> 08:15.566
Nothing.

08:15.601 --> 08:16.801
- What happened?
- Nothing.

08:16.836 --> 08:17.866
It's the onions.

08:17.901 --> 08:19.150
I'm helping the probie

08:19.185 --> 08:20.365
make his first meal.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.000
Jesus Christ,
this is what they send us?

08:22.035 --> 08:23.384
- What's your name?
- Mike?

08:23.419 --> 08:24.734
You asking me or telling me?

08:24.769 --> 08:25.799
It's Mike.

08:25.845 --> 08:28.405
There's too many Mikes around here.
Polish Mike, Irish Mike.

08:28.435 --> 08:29.365
Mike the Mick.

08:29.400 --> 08:30.365
Big Mike, little Mike.

08:30.411 --> 08:31.808
- Hey, are you Jewish?
- No, why?

08:31.827 --> 08:33.063
Then you could be
"Mike the Kike."

08:33.135 --> 08:34.399
- I'm Italian.
- Forget it.

08:34.433 --> 08:36.399
There's already a Guinea Mike
over at Ladder 12.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.868
Not to mention Mike the Wop
over on the Upper East Side.

08:38.903 --> 08:39.832
You know what?
Screw it.

08:39.868 --> 08:41.097
- "New Mike."
- "New Mike" it is.

08:41.133 --> 08:42.866
What if I'm here
for, like, 10 years?

08:42.900 --> 08:45.300
I don't think that's gonna be
a problem. Don't worry about it.

08:45.335 --> 08:46.618
Hey, New Mike,

08:46.653 --> 08:47.866
get me a coffee.

08:47.901 --> 08:50.801
"Liza Minnelli, Donald Trump,
Geraldo Rivera." What's this?

08:50.836 --> 08:52.299
Oh, Billy over here went in

08:52.334 --> 08:54.601
for his first-time-ever
full physical.

08:54.636 --> 08:56.868
Cameras up the ass,
the whole nine yards.

08:56.903 --> 08:58.499
The results come back tomorrow.

08:58.534 --> 09:00.534
He says, if they find
some kind of inoperable cancer,

09:00.564 --> 09:02.234
he's gonna kill
everyone on that list.

09:02.259 --> 09:04.731
In this order? Come on.
Liza has to go first, Bill?

09:04.802 --> 09:06.100
Hasn't she suffered enough?

09:08.968 --> 09:11.050
You know, that ass camera
is really important.

09:11.085 --> 09:13.133
My dad, he wouldn't let them
put one up his ass,

09:13.168 --> 09:14.367
and now he's dead.

09:14.402 --> 09:15.532
Hey, was it, uh...?

09:15.567 --> 09:16.934
I don't know,
uncomfortable?

09:16.969 --> 09:19.032
I mean the camera?

09:19.067 --> 09:21.000
It wasn't really the camera
I minded.

09:21.035 --> 09:21.965
No?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.300
It was the crew.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.067
Hey, probie, bring
your hepatitis kit back?

09:30.102 --> 09:31.132
Hepatitis kit?

09:31.167 --> 09:32.432
Oh, yeah, that's right.

09:32.467 --> 09:33.817
After your class
left the academy,

09:33.846 --> 09:35.319
there was an outbreak
of hepatitis B,

09:35.349 --> 09:37.122
so you gotta leave a urine
and a stool sample

09:37.167 --> 09:39.167
on Chief Perolli's desk
before the end of the week.

09:39.202 --> 09:41.167
You don't know the Grinch.
He's 200% by the book.

09:41.202 --> 09:42.567
So it's imperative
you get this done.

09:42.602 --> 09:43.532
Nobody told me.

09:43.567 --> 09:44.965
So, what, you don't have a kit?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.734
- No.
- Tommy, he don't even have a kit.

09:46.769 --> 09:48.133
How does he not have a kit?

09:48.168 --> 09:49.199
What should I do?

09:49.234 --> 09:50.717
We're gonna have to
get you a kit.

09:50.752 --> 09:52.165
No cream, no sugar?

09:52.200 --> 09:53.165
Engine.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.365
Automated system,

09:54.400 --> 09:55.867
and they had to make it
a woman's voice.

09:55.902 --> 09:57.751
- Ladder.
- Politically correct bullshit.

09:57.786 --> 09:59.566
- Battalion.
- Move, asshole. Move.

09:59.601 --> 10:01.400
That voice is the closest
I'm ever gonna come

10:01.435 --> 10:02.400
to working with a broad.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.534
Move it!

10:14.601 --> 10:15.866
Goddamn.

10:15.901 --> 10:17.834
Major piece of ass candy
on the northeast corner.

10:17.869 --> 10:19.901
Possible Bo Derek
on the northeast corner.

10:25.701 --> 10:27.801
That's more like Heidi Klum.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.866
Who the hell is Heidi Klum?

10:29.901 --> 10:32.501
Hey, man, it smells like shit
in there, bro.

10:32.536 --> 10:33.766
Thanks, pal.
Now, just stand back.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.067
Tommy, take the probie and Sean
and go up Stairway A.

10:36.102 --> 10:37.132
Yeah.

10:37.167 --> 10:38.634
Lou, you and Franco
take B, all right?

10:41.801 --> 10:42.766
That's awful.

10:42.801 --> 10:44.000
Jesus, what is that?

10:44.035 --> 10:46.399
It's... piss.

10:46.434 --> 10:48.567
It's a river of piss.

10:48.602 --> 10:49.866
Jesus.

10:49.901 --> 10:52.599
So, there's no fire?

10:52.634 --> 10:54.034
We can start one
if you want.

10:54.069 --> 10:55.451
Guess we got to
go up, huh?

10:55.486 --> 10:56.834
Yeah. Let's shoot the rapids.

10:56.869 --> 10:57.901
Shit.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.533
Tom...

11:01.568 --> 11:02.951
shall we?

11:02.986 --> 11:04.334
Yeah, yeah.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.899
Look at us.
America's heroes.

11:07.934 --> 11:10.866
Since when are we
in the piss business?

11:10.901 --> 11:12.801
You know what? If there was
white folks up there,

11:12.836 --> 11:14.568
y'all would have been here
in 3 seconds flat.

11:14.603 --> 11:16.300
Modern technology
hasn't gotten to the point

11:16.342 --> 11:18.516
where anybody can get anywhere
in three seconds flat.

11:18.543 --> 11:20.364
Wait. Don't talk to me
about technology, man.

11:20.411 --> 11:21.800
I know about technology.

11:21.839 --> 11:24.426
It's because you don't want
to give the technology

11:24.469 --> 11:25.432
to the black man.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.032
If it was some other people--

11:27.067 --> 11:28.434
You're absolutely right.

11:28.469 --> 11:29.585
You know I'm right.

11:29.620 --> 11:30.666
Right on. Go ahead.

11:30.701 --> 11:32.299
It's a black thing.
What do you got?

11:32.334 --> 11:33.801
You're not gonna
believe this one.

11:33.836 --> 11:34.965
Why don't you just try me?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.484
I got 15 or 20
large jars of piss

11:37.519 --> 11:39.626
someone dumped
down the stairs.

11:39.661 --> 11:41.734
Are we talking about human piss?

11:41.769 --> 11:43.132
Hey, kid.

11:43.167 --> 11:45.701
Taste that piss
and tell me if it's human.

11:53.934 --> 11:56.234
Sometime today
would be nice.

11:57.645 --> 11:58.821
So you admit

11:58.890 --> 12:00.635
to pouring the urine
down the stairway.

12:00.702 --> 12:01.632
You bet your ass.

12:01.667 --> 12:02.833
Where the hell
did you get

12:02.868 --> 12:04.232
20 giant jars
of urine from, sir?

12:04.267 --> 12:05.868
I mean, I don't shop
in this neighborhood,

12:05.903 --> 12:06.833
but--

12:06.868 --> 12:08.599
It's all mine.

12:08.634 --> 12:11.033
Seven or eight months ago,
they told me I had to move,

12:11.068 --> 12:12.634
because I was acting
all crazy and shit.

12:12.669 --> 12:14.834
I'm doing this, I'm doing that.

12:14.869 --> 12:16.965
So I decided, "I'll show them.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.467
I'm gonna piss in the jars
for 24 weeks."

12:20.502 --> 12:22.151
How's that for crazy?

12:22.186 --> 12:23.577
Mm, that's up there.

12:23.612 --> 12:24.906
That's way up there.

12:24.941 --> 12:26.200
Enjoy the ride, now.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.466
- You hear about Lou?
- What?

12:29.501 --> 12:31.534
You know how he went
on that trip to Aspen

12:31.569 --> 12:32.534
a couple weeks ago?

12:33.667 --> 12:35.100
Talking about
the widow thing?

12:35.135 --> 12:36.232
Yeah, yeah.

12:36.267 --> 12:37.600
So there's this
doctor there, right?

12:37.635 --> 12:38.934
Like a therapist
for the widows.

12:38.969 --> 12:39.933
Yeah.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.767
So I guess Lou ends up
talking to the doc

12:41.802 --> 12:43.484
a couple of times,
over beers at first.

12:43.519 --> 12:45.167
The doc tells him
to try writing poetry

12:45.202 --> 12:46.184
to get his feelings out,

12:46.219 --> 12:47.167
so now he's writing poetry.

12:47.202 --> 12:48.432
Bullshit.

12:48.467 --> 12:50.067
No, one of the wives
told Marty Lynch

12:50.102 --> 12:51.032
over at 35 Truck.

12:51.067 --> 12:52.467
She saw some of it,
the poetry.

12:52.502 --> 12:53.432
Bullshit.

12:53.467 --> 12:54.432
I'm telling you.

12:54.467 --> 12:55.634
What's he writing about?

12:55.669 --> 12:56.998
I don't know.

12:57.033 --> 12:58.501
His feelings about 9/11, I guess.

12:58.536 --> 12:59.501
What are you guys doing?

12:59.536 --> 13:00.998
Nothing.

13:01.033 --> 13:03.033
Oh, well, you got that down
to a goddamn science.

13:03.055 --> 13:04.450
Get your greasy
Puerto Rican ass

13:04.473 --> 13:06.056
over to the other side
and help the chief.

13:06.102 --> 13:07.032
- Garrity!
- Yeah?

13:07.067 --> 13:08.067
Get your thick
Mick fingers

13:08.102 --> 13:09.032
over to that engine.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.267
Help them
take in the line.

13:10.302 --> 13:12.418
Don't put that there!

13:12.453 --> 13:14.093
Come on, Garrity.

13:14.128 --> 13:15.699
Jesus Christ.

13:15.734 --> 13:16.734
I'll take care of it.

13:16.769 --> 13:17.766
Get out.

13:17.801 --> 13:19.351
Deputy mayor quoted
in the paper today

13:19.386 --> 13:20.866
as saying we don't
deserve a raise

13:20.901 --> 13:22.934
because we spend 95% of our time
sleeping

13:22.969 --> 13:25.267
and the other 5% fighting fires.

13:25.302 --> 13:26.868
Goddamn Jewbag.

13:26.903 --> 13:28.399
Christ.

13:28.434 --> 13:31.234
I mean, any moron can see
we spend at least 2% of our time

13:31.269 --> 13:32.634
cleaning up piss.

13:34.334 --> 13:35.334
Hey, how you doing?

13:35.369 --> 13:36.534
I'm fine.

13:38.467 --> 13:39.500
Yeah?

13:39.535 --> 13:41.134
Yeah.

13:41.169 --> 13:42.699
You okay?

13:42.734 --> 13:44.217
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:44.252 --> 13:45.701
Why are you asking?

13:45.736 --> 13:47.367
Just asking.

13:48.716 --> 13:50.646
Then why you busting my balls?

13:50.736 --> 13:53.017
I'm not busting your balls.
Just asking how you're doing.

13:53.068 --> 13:54.234
You said you were doing fine.

13:54.269 --> 13:55.199
I am fine.

13:55.234 --> 13:56.267
Fine. Good. Jesus.

13:56.302 --> 13:57.566
Fine. Good.

13:57.601 --> 13:59.000
Can we clean
this shit up, please,

13:59.035 --> 14:00.200
and let's
get out of here?

14:00.235 --> 14:01.666
Mister...

14:01.701 --> 14:03.400
thank you for saving my kitty.

14:14.701 --> 14:16.617
Honey...

14:16.652 --> 14:18.499
I'm home.

14:18.534 --> 14:20.566
I told you,
you have to knock now,

14:20.601 --> 14:23.000
and then wait for me
to answer the door.

14:23.035 --> 14:25.000
Look,
what difference does it make?

14:25.035 --> 14:26.267
And you said 5:00.

14:27.934 --> 14:30.500
I said, "5:00 or so."

14:30.535 --> 14:33.032
There was no "or so."

14:33.067 --> 14:34.667
There was definitely an "or so."

14:34.702 --> 14:36.199
I should know. I said it.

14:36.234 --> 14:37.634
Even if there was
an "or so,"

14:37.669 --> 14:38.785
which there wasn't,

14:38.820 --> 14:39.866
to most people I know,

14:39.901 --> 14:41.866
"or so" means
15 or 20 minutes.

14:41.901 --> 14:43.866
All right, look,
I'm not gonna stand here

14:43.901 --> 14:45.934
and argue the semantics
of "or so" with you, okay?

14:45.969 --> 14:47.534
- I'm just--
- Kids!

14:52.033 --> 14:53.199
Your mom's better.

14:53.234 --> 14:55.367
Yeah. I talked to
my brother Johnny--

14:55.402 --> 14:57.168
Jesus Christ, what the--?

14:57.203 --> 14:58.899
Just don't spit that out.

14:58.934 --> 15:00.767
Katy made them
for you and the guys,

15:00.802 --> 15:01.767
and there she is!

15:01.802 --> 15:02.732
Hey!

15:02.767 --> 15:03.766
Hi, Daddy!

15:03.801 --> 15:04.934
Special K! You...

15:06.200 --> 15:07.801
You make the best cookies
in the world,

15:07.836 --> 15:10.067
- do you know that?
- I can make more.

15:10.102 --> 15:11.232
No.

15:11.267 --> 15:12.868
No, we don't
have time for that, honey.

15:12.903 --> 15:14.267
Go get your books and stuff,
okay?

15:14.302 --> 15:15.167
We got to go.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.033
Oh, my God.

15:19.068 --> 15:20.234
Oh.

15:20.269 --> 15:21.501
Ugh.

15:21.536 --> 15:22.568
God.

15:22.603 --> 15:23.601
Sorry.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.399
Tom, I need money.

15:27.434 --> 15:28.968
What, for tonight? 'Cause--

15:29.003 --> 15:30.634
No, in general.

15:30.669 --> 15:31.799
Oh.

15:31.834 --> 15:33.400
Well, I'm doing a porch
this weekend

15:33.435 --> 15:34.734
with Lou and Franco.

15:34.769 --> 15:35.998
And next weekend,

15:36.033 --> 15:38.067
the good chief's
hiring all of us

15:38.102 --> 15:39.334
to do his, um...

15:39.369 --> 15:41.051
Whatever.

15:41.086 --> 15:42.734
Kids, now!

15:44.100 --> 15:46.434
You know, it's really annoying,
that "whatever" thing.

15:46.469 --> 15:47.632
You know?

15:47.667 --> 15:48.732
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

15:48.767 --> 15:50.065
It's dismissive, you know?

15:50.100 --> 15:52.133
I'm working three jobs.
I'm working my ass off--

15:52.168 --> 15:53.334
Yeah, I have three jobs, too.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.632
Hey, Dad!

15:54.667 --> 15:56.134
And here they come.

15:56.169 --> 15:57.601
Hey! High-five!

15:57.636 --> 15:58.666
Yeah!

15:58.701 --> 15:59.767
Come here, baby.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.284
All set?

16:02.319 --> 16:03.699
Let's go.

16:03.734 --> 16:04.801
Don't forget the cookies.

16:04.836 --> 16:05.933
Right.

16:05.968 --> 16:07.184
The cookies, sweetheart.

16:07.219 --> 16:08.526
- Okay.
- I'll take them.

16:08.561 --> 16:09.799
Connor, cookie patrol.

16:09.834 --> 16:11.199
Oh, and, Connor,
you have a page

16:11.234 --> 16:12.734
of spelling homework
you have to finish.

16:12.790 --> 16:13.529
Okay.

16:13.595 --> 16:16.001
And Colleen has lost her
phone privileges for tonight.

16:16.068 --> 16:17.332
I thought that
was just here!

16:17.367 --> 16:19.200
I can't use the phone
at Dad's either?

16:19.235 --> 16:20.834
No.
Maybe next time you'll think.

16:20.869 --> 16:21.933
What happened?

16:21.968 --> 16:23.367
She snuck a boy in her room.

16:23.402 --> 16:24.584
What?

16:24.619 --> 16:25.732
What boy?

16:25.767 --> 16:27.167
The oldest Murphy
from down the block,

16:27.206 --> 16:28.768
the one
with the pierced eyebrow.

16:28.824 --> 16:31.161
- We were studying.
- Whatever.

16:32.501 --> 16:34.400
Don't make that face
at your mother.

16:38.100 --> 16:39.434
Where did you
get those pants?

16:39.469 --> 16:41.167
Those pants are too low.

16:45.868 --> 16:47.667
Hello.

16:49.067 --> 16:51.532
Kids? Come here.

16:51.567 --> 16:52.900
I'm watching TV.

16:52.935 --> 16:54.617
I don't care.

16:54.652 --> 16:56.300
Come here.

17:00.934 --> 17:03.901
All right, we're gonna play
a little game, okay?

17:03.936 --> 17:06.867
Because Daddy
needs to know some information

17:06.903 --> 17:08.501
about Mommy's new boyfriend.

17:08.536 --> 17:09.767
All right?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.699
But...

17:15.733 --> 17:18.400
Mom doesn't want us
to talk about that

17:18.435 --> 17:19.898
when we're here.

17:19.934 --> 17:21.349
I understand, sweetheart.

17:21.385 --> 17:22.732
That's why we have the money.

17:22.767 --> 17:24.434
See, let me show you
how it works, okay?

17:26.200 --> 17:28.031
Does anybody know anything

17:28.067 --> 17:32.501
about the idea
of moving to California?

17:37.801 --> 17:38.965
Okay.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.333
That'll be the $50 question.

17:40.368 --> 17:41.884
Let's start with an easy one.

17:41.919 --> 17:43.365
Let's go with a fiver, okay?

17:43.400 --> 17:46.100
Does anybody know
the new boyfriend's name?

17:46.135 --> 17:47.632
Roger.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.734
There you go.

17:48.769 --> 17:49.866
Uh-huh.

17:49.901 --> 17:51.399
See how easy that is?

17:51.434 --> 17:54.400
Now, where does Roger live?

17:57.033 --> 17:58.532
10 bucks.

17:58.567 --> 18:00.067
We honestly
don't know.

18:00.102 --> 18:01.567
Somewhere
around here.

18:01.602 --> 18:02.566
Okay.

18:02.601 --> 18:05.350
What does Roger do for a living?

18:05.385 --> 18:08.100
He works for
a finance thing.

18:08.135 --> 18:09.132
Like, a group.

18:09.167 --> 18:10.267
Or a financial group.

18:10.302 --> 18:11.568
Very nice.

18:11.603 --> 18:12.834
Double down.

18:14.701 --> 18:16.699
Now, does anybody know anything

18:16.734 --> 18:21.467
about the idea
of moving to California?

18:21.502 --> 18:23.133
Colleen.

18:24.901 --> 18:26.567
Roger's getting
transferred there

18:26.602 --> 18:27.632
next month,

18:27.667 --> 18:29.317
and Mom's been
talking to us

18:29.352 --> 18:30.968
about how great
it is there.

18:31.003 --> 18:32.566
Sun, surf.

18:32.601 --> 18:34.868
She said we could go
to Disneyland!

18:34.903 --> 18:35.965
Nice.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.599
All right?

18:37.634 --> 18:40.000
Everybody wins.

18:46.767 --> 18:48.634
Get back, get back, get back.

18:52.167 --> 18:53.400
What, he don't have to knock?

18:53.435 --> 18:55.151
I think he has a key.

18:55.186 --> 18:56.693
He has a key to my house?

18:56.728 --> 18:58.165
This is your house.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.734
They're both my houses, okay?

19:02.067 --> 19:03.467
Okay, kids, bedtime.

19:04.467 --> 19:05.699
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

19:05.734 --> 19:07.734
20 bucks for everybody
who goes to bed right now.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.834
Yeah.

19:28.634 --> 19:30.251
Oh, yeah.

19:30.286 --> 19:31.868
Yeah, Daddy.

19:34.167 --> 19:35.367
Shit.

19:36.667 --> 19:38.267
Goddamn it.

20:08.300 --> 20:11.100
Goddamn thief.

20:12.901 --> 20:14.501
Oh! Shit.

20:20.033 --> 20:21.634
Shit.

20:24.968 --> 20:26.065
Dad?

20:26.100 --> 20:27.834
What are you doing here?

20:27.869 --> 20:28.899
I was thirsty.

20:28.934 --> 20:30.267
Shh! There's water in the house.

20:30.302 --> 20:31.601
It's in the kitchen,
the bathroom,

20:31.636 --> 20:32.851
it's all over the place.

20:32.886 --> 20:34.032
I couldn't find you.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.950
I thought maybe
you came to see Mom.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.834
Why--? Why would I come
to see Mom, huh?

20:37.869 --> 20:39.301
- Shh!
- Shh!

20:39.336 --> 20:40.699
- Shh!
- Shh!

20:40.734 --> 20:41.767
- Oh, shit.
- Hey.

20:41.802 --> 20:43.068
What are you doing?

20:43.103 --> 20:44.299
He, uh-- He came--

20:44.334 --> 20:46.183
He wanted some...
Star Wars thing.

20:46.218 --> 20:48.033
I told him not to
come over here,

20:48.068 --> 20:49.401
and he came over
anyways.

20:49.436 --> 20:50.734
Which Star Wars thing, Connor?

20:50.769 --> 20:51.934
I don't know.

20:54.367 --> 20:56.100
He doesn't even
remember. Sorry.

20:56.135 --> 20:57.065
Come on.

20:57.100 --> 20:59.299
Good night, honey.

20:59.334 --> 21:00.800
Good night, sweetheart.

21:00.835 --> 21:02.267
I was talking
to Connor.

21:11.868 --> 21:13.234
Wow.

21:13.269 --> 21:14.566
What?

21:14.601 --> 21:16.868
He's a good-looking guy.

21:16.903 --> 21:19.666
Blow me, okay?

21:19.701 --> 21:21.417
Keep moving, asshole.

21:21.452 --> 21:22.876
Hey, he's no asshole.

21:22.911 --> 21:24.265
What do you mean?

21:24.300 --> 21:26.400
Because the sooner she falls
in love with him,

21:26.435 --> 21:27.851
the sooner
you guys get divorced,

21:27.886 --> 21:29.267
and the sooner
you're off the hook,

21:29.302 --> 21:30.968
financially speaking.

21:31.003 --> 21:32.065
Goddamn it!

21:32.100 --> 21:34.434
It had to be
my beer-opening finger.

21:37.534 --> 21:39.467
What are you doing?
What's with the whiskey?

21:39.502 --> 21:41.267
I'm having a drink.

21:41.302 --> 21:42.998
But what about AA?

21:43.033 --> 21:44.901
I mean, you were sober for,
what, a year?

21:44.936 --> 21:46.300
Fourteen months, to be exact.

21:46.335 --> 21:47.998
Cheers.

21:48.033 --> 21:49.434
No, come on, what are you doing?

21:49.469 --> 21:50.467
Don't do this.

21:50.502 --> 21:51.751
Come on.

21:51.786 --> 21:53.000
Ahh.

21:54.834 --> 21:56.367
The way I figure it...

21:56.402 --> 21:57.901
You're dead, right?

21:59.667 --> 22:02.917
So this conversation
probably isn't happening,

22:02.952 --> 22:06.167
which means that this
probably isn't happening,

22:06.202 --> 22:08.601
so stick around a while, pal.

22:08.636 --> 22:09.566
But no,

22:09.601 --> 22:10.866
you really want to do that?

22:10.901 --> 22:12.501
Hey, who deserves a drink
more than me,

22:12.536 --> 22:13.699
sitting here,

22:13.734 --> 22:15.734
having to watch that guy
do whatever with my wife?

22:15.769 --> 22:16.801
She's your ex-wife.

22:16.836 --> 22:17.934
Hey, hey, hey.

22:17.969 --> 22:18.998
Not yet, okay?

22:19.033 --> 22:20.666
- Not yet.
- But you're--

22:20.701 --> 22:22.567
It's happening, right?
I mean, you're working on it.

22:22.602 --> 22:23.732
The divorce.

22:23.767 --> 22:25.000
It's just--
It's not official.

22:25.035 --> 22:26.234
You're still in love with her.

22:26.269 --> 22:27.532
No, I'm not.

22:27.567 --> 22:28.599
You little girl.

22:28.634 --> 22:29.866
What are you doing--?

22:29.901 --> 22:31.566
Hey, you're the asshole,
not him.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.801
Jimmy, look,
I'm not in love with her, okay?

22:33.836 --> 22:34.799
I love her.

22:34.834 --> 22:36.232
Of course,
I will always love her,

22:36.267 --> 22:37.868
because she's the mother
of my kids, okay?

22:37.903 --> 22:40.265
I have feelings for her
that way,

22:40.300 --> 22:42.834
and I want her to fall in love
with somebody else.

22:42.869 --> 22:44.351
Yeah, of course I do, you know?

22:44.386 --> 22:45.799
But I want it to happen in a--

22:45.834 --> 22:47.834
You know,
in a normal amount of time.

22:47.869 --> 22:48.899
Like...

22:48.934 --> 22:51.365
three, four years, tops.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.000
All right,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

22:53.035 --> 22:53.965
Let's review.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.400
Why are you two separated?

22:55.435 --> 22:56.434
According to her?

22:56.469 --> 22:57.399
Yeah.

22:57.434 --> 22:59.098
You know, I...

22:59.133 --> 23:00.701
She says I couldn't open up.

23:00.736 --> 23:01.666
I wasn't...

23:01.701 --> 23:03.067
emotionally available.

23:03.102 --> 23:04.267
Blah, blah, blah.

23:04.302 --> 23:05.432
Are you?

23:05.467 --> 23:07.632
Oh, and you are?

23:07.667 --> 23:09.634
Hey, I got an excuse. I'm dead.

23:09.669 --> 23:11.000
Cheap shot.

23:11.035 --> 23:12.032
Daddy?

23:12.067 --> 23:14.067
Who are you talking to?

23:14.102 --> 23:15.632
I'm talking to--

23:15.667 --> 23:17.267
I was watching television,
honey.

23:17.302 --> 23:19.484
I need a drink of water.

23:19.519 --> 23:21.426
Yeah, sure, honey, hang on.

23:21.461 --> 23:23.299
I watched the guy

23:23.334 --> 23:25.334
steal my FDNY lighter
from my own house.

23:25.369 --> 23:26.299
What FDNY lighter?

23:26.334 --> 23:27.332
What are you
talking about?

23:27.367 --> 23:29.467
You know, the one
my cousin Jimmy gave me.

23:29.502 --> 23:30.618
You know,
when I quit smoking.

23:30.653 --> 23:31.734
Because I don't
take medals.

23:31.769 --> 23:32.699
Way to move the ball!

23:32.734 --> 23:33.867
Look,
forget the lighter.

23:33.902 --> 23:35.000
What you need
to worry about

23:35.035 --> 23:36.017
is your balls.

23:36.052 --> 23:36.965
You see that kid?

23:37.000 --> 23:38.165
See the arm
on that kid?

23:38.200 --> 23:40.367
Ten more yards, baby.
Give me 10 more yards.

23:40.402 --> 23:41.466
What are you
talking about?

23:41.501 --> 23:42.866
Look, when you and Janet
had split,

23:42.901 --> 23:44.801
you went around
telling me and all the guys

23:44.836 --> 23:46.701
how great it was gonna be
to be single again:

23:46.740 --> 23:48.953
booze, broads and blow jobs,
blah, blah, blah. Now look at you,

23:48.989 --> 23:50.853
sitting across the street,
spying on your ex-wife.

23:50.903 --> 23:51.933
What're you talking about?

23:51.968 --> 23:53.384
It's been booze, broads
and blow jobs.

23:53.419 --> 23:54.766
What about that blonde
at the club?

23:54.801 --> 23:56.499
That blonde was hanging
all over you.

23:56.534 --> 23:58.801
She was gonna clear the floor
and do you right there.

23:58.836 --> 24:00.000
You bet your ass she was.

24:00.035 --> 24:01.032
So?

24:01.067 --> 24:02.399
So what?

24:02.434 --> 24:04.232
We have sex with women
who ain't our wives,

24:04.267 --> 24:06.300
we make every detail available
to the other guys.

24:06.335 --> 24:07.667
Yeah, well, maybe
I'm a gentleman.

24:07.702 --> 24:09.218
Yeah, maybe I'm growing tits.

24:09.253 --> 24:10.734
Hey, check a mirror, pal.

24:10.769 --> 24:12.051
Well?

24:12.086 --> 24:13.299
I scored.

24:13.334 --> 24:14.432
You banged her?

24:14.467 --> 24:15.667
Oh, yeah.
Three times.

24:15.702 --> 24:16.866
Viagra?

24:16.901 --> 24:18.632
Nope.
Au naturel, pal.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.432
Look, you're great.
It's just that I'm--

24:20.467 --> 24:24.868
I'm in a kind of a transitional
type of situation

24:24.903 --> 24:25.899
type of thing.

24:25.934 --> 24:27.299
And a lot of guys, you know,

24:27.337 --> 24:28.669
they get separated
from their wives,

24:28.700 --> 24:30.535
they start banging
every major piece of ass--

24:30.602 --> 24:33.065
Not that you're...

24:33.100 --> 24:34.567
Not that you're not a,
you know--

24:34.602 --> 24:35.732
You're--

24:35.767 --> 24:36.934
You're a major--

24:36.969 --> 24:38.299
You're a--

24:38.334 --> 24:39.367
You're
the whole package.

24:39.402 --> 24:40.566
I'm just, uh...

24:40.601 --> 24:42.234
I'm conflicted, I guess,
is what I am.

24:42.269 --> 24:43.532
I'm a little...

24:43.567 --> 24:45.534
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

24:46.934 --> 24:48.601
Whatever.

24:52.100 --> 24:53.132
So how was she?

24:53.167 --> 24:55.098
Scale of 10?
Twenty-five.

24:55.133 --> 24:56.701
No, no, no, Tommy.
Details, many details.

24:57.868 --> 24:58.866
Engine.

24:58.901 --> 25:00.100
Not your night, pal.

25:00.135 --> 25:01.566
Ladder.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.000
Oh, lick me blind!

25:03.035 --> 25:04.165
Battalion.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.467
A computerized broad
is running my life.

25:06.502 --> 25:07.868
I got 200 bucks on this game.

25:07.903 --> 25:08.968
Come on, let's go.

25:09.003 --> 25:10.100
Come on.

25:23.534 --> 25:25.200
Bobby?

25:36.534 --> 25:38.300
Bob!

25:38.335 --> 25:39.918
Tommy!

25:39.953 --> 25:41.466
What?

25:41.501 --> 25:42.667
Over here.

25:45.467 --> 25:47.098
Where?

25:47.133 --> 25:48.834
Down here, man,
down here!

25:48.869 --> 25:50.200
Bob?

25:54.534 --> 25:55.734
Where's Jimmy, man?

25:55.769 --> 25:56.968
What happened?

25:57.003 --> 25:58.065
Shit.

25:58.100 --> 26:00.467
Tommy, I can't feel my legs.

26:02.501 --> 26:03.784
Battalion 1-5. 1-5 out.

26:03.819 --> 26:05.032
We're transmitting 10-75.

26:05.067 --> 26:07.667
Franco, help the chauffeur
and the OBM

26:07.702 --> 26:08.799
ladder the building.

26:08.834 --> 26:10.501
We got smoke pushing out
a fifth floor window.

26:13.396 --> 26:15.808
You guys all right?
You got everything under control?

26:15.869 --> 26:16.965
- Yeah.
- All right.

26:17.004 --> 26:19.300
Probie's gonna get
his cherry popped tonight.

26:20.667 --> 26:21.732
Hey, probie,

26:21.767 --> 26:23.167
you ready
to be a hero, baby?

26:23.202 --> 26:24.033
All right.

26:30.767 --> 26:32.133
Come on, asshole.

26:32.168 --> 26:33.701
Be a man.

26:35.300 --> 26:37.067
Right now.

26:39.701 --> 26:41.300
What are you looking at?

26:41.335 --> 26:42.499
Nothing.

26:42.534 --> 26:43.884
Hey, what's going on
over here?

26:43.919 --> 26:45.199
Fire hydrant's
out of service.

26:45.234 --> 26:46.834
Yeah, it's spinning,
but it's got no ring.

26:46.869 --> 26:48.032
There's a standpipe

26:48.067 --> 26:50.098
in the northeast corner
of 1445,

26:50.133 --> 26:51.734
in the basement,
just past the boiler room.

26:51.769 --> 26:53.299
There's another one at 1448.

26:53.334 --> 26:55.901
First floor, right underneath
the "no loitering" sign.

26:55.936 --> 26:57.033
Come on, we need water.

26:57.068 --> 26:58.199
Who is that guy?

26:58.234 --> 27:00.133
Rain man.
Let's get going.

27:00.168 --> 27:01.601
All the way up.

27:11.667 --> 27:12.934
Come on,
get up that building.

27:12.969 --> 27:13.933
This is 1-5 to 99.

27:13.968 --> 27:15.933
As soon as you
got that line, charge it.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.334
You're gonna have to give me
the booster water first.

27:18.369 --> 27:19.299
4B!

27:19.334 --> 27:20.933
- What?
- She said 4B!

27:20.968 --> 27:22.767
It should be the other
end of the hall!

27:22.802 --> 27:23.968
I had a call here once.

27:24.003 --> 27:25.332
False alarm.

27:25.367 --> 27:26.534
Small kitchen in the front,

27:26.569 --> 27:27.499
living room,

27:27.534 --> 27:28.517
bedroom in the back.

27:28.552 --> 27:29.501
All right.

27:30.634 --> 27:32.117
Hey, kid.

27:32.152 --> 27:33.601
Take this.

27:54.267 --> 27:56.067
Give me the Halligan.

27:56.102 --> 27:57.132
What?

27:57.167 --> 27:58.650
Give me the halogen!

27:58.685 --> 28:00.133
Here, here. Sorry.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.200
Hey, Tommy, where are you?

28:23.235 --> 28:24.200
Hey!

28:25.968 --> 28:29.267
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

28:29.302 --> 28:31.484
Hey!

28:31.519 --> 28:33.667
Hey!

28:36.100 --> 28:37.200
Come here.

28:40.100 --> 28:42.033
I told you to stay close,
asshole.

28:42.068 --> 28:43.133
Come on.

28:53.567 --> 28:55.300
Pull my arm.

28:55.335 --> 28:56.265
What?

28:56.300 --> 28:58.400
Pull my arm.

29:03.801 --> 29:04.801
Go! Move!

29:09.667 --> 29:11.534
Give us this day
our daily bread,

29:11.569 --> 29:12.732
and forgive us our trespasses

29:12.767 --> 29:14.833
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

29:14.868 --> 29:18.868
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

29:34.567 --> 29:36.334
Tommy, where are you?

29:36.369 --> 29:38.165
Coming out.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.501
I got two 10-45s,
one unconscious.

29:45.501 --> 29:46.699
Hey.

29:46.734 --> 29:48.868
The bitch is in 4-B.
The living room.

29:50.133 --> 29:51.933
Holy shit,
that was amazing.

29:51.968 --> 29:53.834
Let's go, come on.
We're not done.

29:53.869 --> 29:55.666
There's a family of 10
up in 5A.

29:55.701 --> 29:57.501
- You want us up there?
- Yeah, more the merrier.

29:57.536 --> 29:59.100
Lou says he heard noises
coming from 6F.

29:59.140 --> 30:00.746
He thinks someone's
still in there.

30:00.774 --> 30:02.253
Come on.
Go, go, go, go.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.767
Got one CSI
coming up for you!

30:04.802 --> 30:05.968
Open up! Fire department!

30:06.003 --> 30:07.501
Hello?

30:08.701 --> 30:10.067
Fire department!

30:15.634 --> 30:17.699
Hey, Billy,

30:17.734 --> 30:18.950
you see
an ashtray around?

30:18.985 --> 30:20.167
I'm looking
for one myself.

30:20.202 --> 30:21.401
How we doing, boys?

30:21.436 --> 30:22.566
Place is empty, Chief.

30:22.601 --> 30:23.984
- Primary search negative.
- Great.

30:24.019 --> 30:25.367
Start the secondary
floor-by-floor,

30:25.402 --> 30:26.367
all right, Billy?

30:26.402 --> 30:27.332
10-4.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.666
Battalion 1-5 to 1-5 Alpha.

30:28.701 --> 30:30.033
Primary search
is already completed.

30:30.068 --> 30:31.567
Secondary in progress.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.901
What channel's that game on?

30:48.367 --> 30:49.365
Whoa, ho, ho.

30:49.400 --> 30:50.667
Take it easy, man.
Take it easy.

30:52.968 --> 30:54.065
- Here.
- What?

30:54.100 --> 30:55.484
It's all I could find.

30:55.519 --> 30:56.868
You want to flip him?

30:57.868 --> 30:58.934
He's a junkie, not an omelet.

31:14.067 --> 31:15.734
Welcome to 62 Truck.

31:18.667 --> 31:21.466
Grab the other end.

31:21.501 --> 31:22.984
Imagine how much
he must have weighed

31:23.019 --> 31:24.467
before he developed
the coke habit.

31:28.167 --> 31:29.634
Come on.

31:30.934 --> 31:32.265
Aw, J--!

31:32.300 --> 31:34.834
The Browns are down
by 12 points.

31:34.869 --> 31:36.065
Jesus.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.434
Hey, chief, the fire's
under control.

31:38.469 --> 31:40.468
Chief? Hey, chief?

31:40.503 --> 31:42.432
Okay.

31:42.467 --> 31:43.666
Aw, come on!

31:43.701 --> 31:45.467
You call that a pass?

31:47.434 --> 31:49.033
Maybe we want to do
this someplace else?

31:49.068 --> 31:50.299
I'm sorry.

31:50.334 --> 31:51.534
Don't be sorry.
I'm just saying--

31:51.569 --> 31:52.499
Hey, where's Tommy?

31:52.534 --> 31:53.734
I think he's taking a piss.

31:53.769 --> 31:55.732
Where's the chief?

31:55.767 --> 31:57.317
I didn't see him come out.

31:57.352 --> 31:58.833
Then where the hell is he?

31:58.868 --> 32:00.968
And finally,
it takes about the whole...

32:01.003 --> 32:02.199
Jesus Christ,

32:02.234 --> 32:04.300
these guys are playing
like they know my bookie.

32:04.335 --> 32:05.699
I'm losing on everything here.

32:05.734 --> 32:07.968
The over, first downs,
interceptions, sacks.

32:08.003 --> 32:09.299
They're killing me!

32:09.334 --> 32:10.984
You bet on
all that stuff?

32:11.019 --> 32:12.599
That's some
serious gambling.

32:12.634 --> 32:14.901
Hey, pal,
I'm a New York City fireman.

32:14.936 --> 32:16.868
My whole life's
a goddamn gamble.

32:18.334 --> 32:19.868
Here we are.

32:19.903 --> 32:21.367
Thanks.

32:22.501 --> 32:23.866
Ah, it's bad enough

32:23.901 --> 32:26.534
for a kid to know that
he lost his dog in a fire.

32:26.569 --> 32:28.284
No need for him to see it.

32:28.319 --> 32:29.965
Hmm? Hold on a second.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.817
I think I dipped
his paw in there.

32:31.852 --> 32:33.634
You might as well
throw that out too.

32:33.669 --> 32:34.934
So, uh, Garrity,
I was thinking,

32:34.969 --> 32:36.251
that chick
on the third floor,

32:36.286 --> 32:37.499
- the single mother...?
- Yeah?

32:37.534 --> 32:39.934
I might offer her my bed.
She needs a place to stay.

32:39.969 --> 32:41.088
Oh, yeah? Single mother?

32:41.127 --> 32:42.864
- Yeah.
- How do you know that?

32:42.923 --> 32:43.918
Help!

32:43.968 --> 32:45.199
Holy shit.

32:45.234 --> 32:47.267
Hey, I thought you said
the building was cleared, Bill.

32:47.317 --> 32:48.737
It is. Everyone's
accounted for.

32:48.756 --> 32:49.992
Oh, no! Wait, wait!

32:53.834 --> 32:55.567
Come to my tea party.

32:55.602 --> 32:56.667
Damn it, Tommy!

33:01.133 --> 33:02.667
Son of a bitch.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.466
Howdy, cuz.

33:09.501 --> 33:11.666
Jesus. Gimme
a little warning, huh?

33:11.701 --> 33:14.033
You really think you fooled
the guys down there with that?

33:14.068 --> 33:16.267
You couldn't even come
inside this building

33:16.302 --> 33:18.467
without taking
a couple hits off your flask.

33:18.502 --> 33:20.065
Hey!

33:20.100 --> 33:21.501
Need a hand in here?

33:21.536 --> 33:23.535
No.

33:23.570 --> 33:25.534
No, no.

33:27.467 --> 33:29.467
- Oh.
- Jesus. Take it easy.

33:29.502 --> 33:30.567
Easy.

33:32.734 --> 33:35.199
Hey, uh, you know,
with my family history and all,

33:35.234 --> 33:38.000
I'm thinking about having
a doctor put a camera up my--

33:38.035 --> 33:39.032
My colon.

33:39.067 --> 33:40.599
Sean, you're 28 years old.

33:40.634 --> 33:42.434
Yeah, I know,
but it's driving me crazy.

33:42.469 --> 33:43.599
What is?

33:43.634 --> 33:45.350
Wondering what's going on
inside my ass.

33:45.385 --> 33:47.032
Hey, forget about your ass,
all right?

33:47.067 --> 33:49.032
Have them stick a camera
in one of your ears

33:49.135 --> 33:51.547
and find out what kind of
brain damage we're dealing with.

33:52.367 --> 33:53.434
Thanks, Franco.

33:53.469 --> 33:54.466
That's sweet.

33:54.501 --> 33:56.501
Sean, I'm just saying.

33:57.701 --> 33:58.833
Hey, probie.

33:58.868 --> 34:00.934
You know, there's
an old saying in the FDNY:

34:00.969 --> 34:03.235
If you ain't scared,
you're crazy.

34:03.270 --> 34:05.501
You got some puke
on your chin.

34:05.536 --> 34:06.801
Thanks.

34:09.868 --> 34:11.934
Hey. Here's your
hepatitis kit, okay?

34:11.969 --> 34:13.768
Piss in the cup,
shit in the bag,

34:13.803 --> 34:15.567
put them on
the chief's desk.

34:15.601 --> 34:16.532
Really?

34:16.567 --> 34:18.400
No, it's a joke.

34:18.435 --> 34:19.934
What are you doing?

34:19.969 --> 34:21.399
What? Oh, nothing.

34:21.434 --> 34:23.400
I was just thinking
about my ass, you know?

34:23.435 --> 34:24.333
Cancer-wise.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.399
Surrounded by fags.

34:31.434 --> 34:35.016
The lioness
may provide meat for all.

34:35.052 --> 34:38.565
Both may scavenge
each other's kills.

34:38.601 --> 34:42.000
The hyenas wait patiently
in the darkness of the brush.

34:42.034 --> 34:43.434
Got 50 on the lion.

34:43.469 --> 34:44.799
Hyenas to match.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.949
What, are we betting
on the food chain now?

34:46.985 --> 34:49.067
- Yeah. You want in?
- Yeah, I'll go with the lion.

34:49.101 --> 34:50.098
What about you,
Garrity?

34:50.132 --> 34:52.166
- No, no, I'm gonna wait.
- Wait for what?

34:52.201 --> 34:54.199
I don't know.
Maybe a tiger will show up.

34:54.235 --> 34:55.799
Hi.

34:55.833 --> 34:57.300
Uh, is there
a Chief Reilly here?

34:57.335 --> 34:58.998
Who's asking?

34:59.033 --> 35:00.750
Uh, I'm Dr. Goldberg. I was--

35:00.785 --> 35:02.467
Oh, oh, oh!
Yeah, yeah, sure.

35:02.502 --> 35:03.467
Come in, doc.

35:03.502 --> 35:04.699
Hi.

35:04.734 --> 35:05.968
Uh, guys,
this is Dr. Goldberg.

35:06.003 --> 35:07.098
She's a shrink.

35:07.133 --> 35:09.133
Actually, I'm a psychotherapist.

35:10.968 --> 35:12.232
Yeah.

35:12.267 --> 35:14.801
Well, Chief Perolli has a friend
down at headquarters

35:14.836 --> 35:16.232
who thought it'd be a good idea

35:16.267 --> 35:18.701
for these doctors
to stop by the firehouse

35:18.736 --> 35:20.098
for a couple hours at a clip

35:20.133 --> 35:21.868
so we could get
our feelings off our chests.

35:23.300 --> 35:25.098
Um, may I?

35:25.133 --> 35:26.666
We're finding
that the...

35:26.701 --> 35:28.998
effects of 9/11 are
still being felt,

35:29.033 --> 35:31.267
especially among members of
the police and fire depart--

35:31.302 --> 35:33.100
Jesus, look at the lion!

35:34.100 --> 35:35.332
Unbelievable.

35:35.367 --> 35:36.968
I'm losing everything
to mother nature here.

35:37.003 --> 35:37.933
Rats.

35:37.968 --> 35:40.451
So I'm, uh, here to help,

35:40.486 --> 35:42.899
if anyone would like to talk.

35:42.934 --> 35:44.934
But, uh, we don't
have to talk to you

35:44.969 --> 35:47.400
if we don't want to, right?

35:47.435 --> 35:49.868
No, you don't, but...

36:06.801 --> 36:09.200
I had a 20 there, chief.

36:09.235 --> 36:10.834
Thanks.

36:19.801 --> 36:21.432
Look, doc...

36:21.467 --> 36:23.065
Oh, you don't
need to explain.

36:23.100 --> 36:25.434
I was at another firehouse
last night.

36:25.469 --> 36:28.301
The reaction was quite similar.

36:28.336 --> 36:31.098
Yeah, the guys are not, uh...

36:31.133 --> 36:34.601
They're not gonna talk
to a psychotherapist, you know,

36:34.636 --> 36:35.998
in the firehouse--

36:36.033 --> 36:36.934
especially a female one.

36:39.567 --> 36:41.499
What about
the female firefighters?

36:41.534 --> 36:43.601
We don't have any female
firefighters in this house.

36:43.636 --> 36:44.767
Are you threatened
by women?

36:46.567 --> 36:48.998
No.

36:49.033 --> 36:51.601
You don't seem to think that
a woman can be a firefighter.

36:53.267 --> 36:54.632
I'll tell you what.

36:54.667 --> 36:57.267
It's not about being
a man or a woman, okay?

36:57.302 --> 36:58.732
It's about doing the job.

36:58.767 --> 37:01.300
It's about me getting home
safe and sound in the morning

37:01.335 --> 37:03.034
to see my kids, okay?

37:03.069 --> 37:04.699
So if you got a woman

37:04.734 --> 37:07.133
who can do the job
better than the guys in my crew,

37:07.168 --> 37:08.365
bring her on, you know?

37:08.400 --> 37:10.532
You got a Martian or a cyborg

37:10.567 --> 37:12.234
or a Chinaman
that can do the job,

37:12.269 --> 37:13.532
bring them on too.

37:13.567 --> 37:15.968
Are there
any Chinese firefighters?

37:16.003 --> 37:18.032
Yeah, probably.

37:18.067 --> 37:20.100
Somewhere in... China.

37:23.234 --> 37:25.800
I'm sensing a lot of hostility.

37:25.835 --> 37:27.851
You are very, very perceptive.

37:27.886 --> 37:29.868
That's what
they tell me.

37:29.903 --> 37:31.334
Mm-hmm.

37:36.100 --> 37:38.901
You want us to talk about
our feelings?

37:38.936 --> 37:39.834
Yes, I do.

37:42.701 --> 37:46.133
Forget 9/11, all right?

37:46.168 --> 37:48.000
Five years ago.

37:48.035 --> 37:49.851
Black kid.

37:49.886 --> 37:51.632
Ten years old.

37:51.667 --> 37:53.634
Pulled him out of a closet.

37:53.669 --> 37:54.901
Hot fire all around.

37:54.936 --> 37:56.484
He's burnt,

37:56.519 --> 37:57.998
he's scared,

37:58.033 --> 38:01.901
and he's slippin' and slidin'
around in my arms like a--

38:01.936 --> 38:04.718
Like a goddamn baby seal.

38:04.753 --> 38:07.501
And I almost got him outside.

38:07.536 --> 38:09.766
And his skin--

38:09.801 --> 38:12.734
He's wearing
nothing but underwear.

38:12.769 --> 38:14.399
And his skin comes off

38:14.434 --> 38:18.466
like wrapping paper
off of a Christmas present.

38:18.501 --> 38:20.901
He slips right out of my arms,
he falls on the floor.

38:20.936 --> 38:23.098
Pick him up, get him outside.

38:23.133 --> 38:25.000
A few months later,
he dies in the burn center.

38:30.701 --> 38:34.634
Three years ago,
a project fire, six stories up.

38:34.669 --> 38:35.933
One-bedroom apartment.

38:35.968 --> 38:38.000
Fifteen people living in it.

38:38.035 --> 38:39.799
And I--

38:39.834 --> 38:41.433
I find a little girl.

38:41.468 --> 38:43.033
She's hurt pretty bad,

38:43.068 --> 38:44.899
holding a kitten.

38:44.934 --> 38:46.467
I bring her down, six stories.

38:46.502 --> 38:47.799
Six goddamn stories,

38:47.834 --> 38:50.033
I'm switching my mask off
with her and the kitten.

38:50.068 --> 38:51.867
And her and the kitten and me.

38:51.902 --> 38:53.632
Her and the kitten and me.

38:53.667 --> 38:55.666
She's crying up to me
the whole time,

38:55.701 --> 38:57.866
saying, "Please, Mr. Fireman.
Please save my kitten.

38:57.901 --> 39:00.300
Please don't let anything happen
to my kitten, Mr. Fireman."

39:00.335 --> 39:02.767
And I'm biting my tongue,
'cause I hate cats.

39:02.802 --> 39:04.666
I think they suck.

39:04.701 --> 39:05.767
I come from a dog family.

39:07.834 --> 39:10.467
Anyways, long story short...

39:10.502 --> 39:12.000
the cat lived...

39:12.035 --> 39:13.234
she didn't.

39:16.567 --> 39:19.466
9/11...

39:19.501 --> 39:22.534
we lost four guys
from this house.

39:22.569 --> 39:25.567
One of 'em was my cousin Jimmy.

39:37.501 --> 39:40.299
My best friend...

39:40.334 --> 39:41.868
Best goddamn fireman
I ever worked with,

39:41.903 --> 39:42.868
good family man.

39:43.433 --> 39:45.513
Dedicated American,
blah, blah, blah, you know?

39:45.602 --> 39:47.200
And every day,
I gotta drive to work.

39:47.235 --> 39:48.566
I drive through my neighborhood.

39:48.601 --> 39:51.467
I see guys, drunken assholes
that I went to high school with,

39:51.502 --> 39:53.467
who stand on the corner, high,
having a great time,

39:53.502 --> 39:55.065
and I gotta wonder why...

39:55.100 --> 39:56.767
these assholes
are still walking around

39:56.802 --> 39:58.300
when Jimmy Keefe ain't.

40:04.901 --> 40:06.901
My cousin, the priest,
says it's because...

40:08.467 --> 40:10.834
it's all part of God's plan,
like God's got a plan.

40:10.869 --> 40:12.232
You know what?

40:12.267 --> 40:14.232
If there is a God...

40:14.267 --> 40:16.667
he's got a whole shitload
of explaining to do.

41:12.400 --> 41:15.601
Hey, Billy, there's
a Dr. Phelan on the phone?

41:31.467 --> 41:33.450
Hello.

41:33.485 --> 41:35.434
Yeah.

42:55.743 --> 42:58.370

43:01.499 --> 43:04.542
- Whoops! -

43:05.868 --> 43:07.265
No, sir, no.

43:07.300 --> 43:10.567
These men have worked much
too much overtime as it is.

43:10.602 --> 43:12.032
Don't you worry.

43:12.067 --> 43:15.634
No. I'll be able to get 'em
to do it on straight time.

43:15.669 --> 43:17.268
Yes, sir.

43:17.303 --> 43:18.833
Yes, sir.

43:18.868 --> 43:19.901
Thank you, sir.

43:19.936 --> 43:20.866
Sure.

43:20.901 --> 43:22.467
Thank you very much.

43:22.502 --> 43:23.701
Goodbye.

43:30.467 --> 43:32.000
Jesus Christ.

43:37.367 --> 43:38.800
Agh!

43:38.835 --> 43:40.234
Oh, God!

43:50.801 --> 43:52.334
Silletti!
