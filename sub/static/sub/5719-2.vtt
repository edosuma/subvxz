00:00.341 --> 00:01.872
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.892 --> 00:03.160
Lou, you can't be serious
with this.

00:03.194 --> 00:04.694
What'd you do,
just go on the Internet

00:04.729 --> 00:05.961
and find samples
of separation agreements

00:05.996 --> 00:07.330
and cobble this together?

00:07.364 --> 00:09.499
Maybe we need
some professional help.

00:09.533 --> 00:11.334
Maybe you just send it
to my lawyer, I guess.

00:11.368 --> 00:12.768
I will.

00:12.802 --> 00:14.170
(Grunting)
We have to let him out.

00:14.204 --> 00:16.172
- Why?
- To see where he goes when he's free.

00:16.206 --> 00:18.874
(High-pitched whinny)

00:18.908 --> 00:20.843
That's why he wanted out.

00:20.877 --> 00:23.111
Hey, buddy, you'll be okay.

00:23.146 --> 00:25.980
Buddy, I like that.
Bear and Buddy.

00:26.015 --> 00:30.918
- You guys were doing so well.
- We weren't, Grandpa. We really weren't.

00:30.953 --> 00:32.654
But Lawyers?

00:32.688 --> 00:34.356
(Envelope rustles)

00:35.758 --> 00:39.093
Hey, Grandpa, can you
make sure you take the mail?

00:42.430 --> 00:44.064
(School bus rumbles)

00:46.234 --> 00:48.135
First one to knock a rail
buys lunch?

00:48.170 --> 00:50.237
- You're on!
- Okay.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.790 --> 01:11.824
(Rail clatters slightly)

01:11.858 --> 01:14.959
I know, I know. I killed it.

01:14.994 --> 01:17.128
Actually, you clipped the rail.

01:17.163 --> 01:19.198
Barely.
But I didn't knock it off.

01:19.232 --> 01:22.000
- Still, not a perfect run.
- Close enough.

01:22.034 --> 01:24.503
So when you buy me lunch,

01:24.537 --> 01:27.206
I'll be having extra bacon
on my burger,

01:27.240 --> 01:29.007
with a side of extra bacon.

01:29.041 --> 01:30.541
Not so fast, Bacon Boy.

01:30.576 --> 01:33.311
I'm about to show you
what a flawless run looks like.

01:33.345 --> 01:35.913
- Big talk.
- Watch and learn.

02:01.839 --> 02:03.973
(Clapping)

02:04.007 --> 02:05.708
All right, you win.

02:05.742 --> 02:07.042
(Sighs) Sorry, what was that?

02:07.076 --> 02:08.410
I'm not saying it again.

02:08.445 --> 02:09.945
That's all right.
You can tell me

02:09.979 --> 02:11.213
over the lunch
you're gonna buy me.

02:11.248 --> 02:14.182
I guess it's a date, then.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.618
Wh-what?

02:15.652 --> 02:18.987
Uh... no, not a date-date.

02:19.021 --> 02:22.223
Unless... you... want it to be.

02:22.258 --> 02:25.260
Well, do you want it to be?

02:25.294 --> 02:27.161
Okay.

02:27.195 --> 02:29.930
Okay. I'm gonna go
raise those jumps;

02:29.965 --> 02:32.634
that was way too easy.

02:32.668 --> 02:34.335
Right.

02:36.938 --> 02:40.073
(Rail clicks into place)

02:45.747 --> 02:48.014
(Books and papers shuffle)

02:48.048 --> 02:49.949
- Whoa. Care-careful!
- Oh, sorry.

02:49.984 --> 02:51.318
- Careful.
- Sorry.

02:51.352 --> 02:53.953
- Am I in your way, Amy?
- No, you're fine.

02:53.988 --> 02:57.356
I'm just looking for, uh,
a list of supplies.

02:58.892 --> 03:01.527
Oh, I think I saw that
somewhere here.

03:01.561 --> 03:04.096
Uh, it's...
Yeah, it's this, isn't it?

03:04.130 --> 03:07.500
- Yes, thank you.
- There you go.

03:07.534 --> 03:10.803
So um... when do I get to see
you where this?

03:10.837 --> 03:12.271
- Hey!
- What?

03:12.305 --> 03:14.071
In a few days at my convocation.

03:14.106 --> 03:15.507
But I want a sneak peek.

03:15.541 --> 03:18.677
It's bad luck to see it
beforehand. I think.

03:18.711 --> 03:21.613
- Please?
- (Laughs) No.

03:21.647 --> 03:24.683
Plus I need the whole robe
for the full effect.

03:24.717 --> 03:27.819
(Sighs) Oh.
(Laughs)

03:27.853 --> 03:31.988
Have I told you
how proud I am of you?

03:32.023 --> 03:35.258
- Only about a hundred times.
- Mm-hmm. (Kiss)

03:35.293 --> 03:37.294
- I got some good news about Buddy.
- Oh?

03:37.329 --> 03:39.029
Take a look.

03:39.063 --> 03:41.031
That shot of Streptomycin
seemed to do the trick.

03:41.065 --> 03:42.800
There's a lot less
gram-positive bacteria

03:42.834 --> 03:45.268
- in the skin scraping I did this morning.
- (Giggling) Mmhmm.

03:45.303 --> 03:49.706
- What?
- Okay, one more time in English.

03:49.740 --> 03:53.075
He's not a hundred percent,
but he's a lot better.

03:53.109 --> 03:56.846
So if he's better,
then why isn't he eating?

03:56.880 --> 03:58.247
(Sighs) I don't know.

03:58.281 --> 04:00.650
Other than the rain rot,
he's pretty healthy.

04:00.684 --> 04:02.597
You know, I've seen horses
refuse to eat

04:02.617 --> 04:05.487
because they're depressed.

04:06.355 --> 04:08.868
Well, maybe he's misses
his owner.

04:09.826 --> 04:12.828
I just wish I knew who that was.

04:12.862 --> 04:15.930
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

04:21.101 --> 04:24.686
You and Caleb are gonna have to
deal with the cattle on your own

04:24.706 --> 04:26.373
for the next few days,

04:26.407 --> 04:29.143
till my knee starts
to feel better.

04:29.177 --> 04:31.411
Don't worry about the loft.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.380
I can still help you
with the renovations.

04:33.414 --> 04:34.682
You gotta get that knee
looked at, Jack.

04:34.716 --> 04:36.416
You've been complaining about
it for days.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.517
Don't bother, Dad.
There is no way Grandpa

04:38.552 --> 04:41.120
is gonna let Dr. Virani
anywhere near that knee.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.955
He would rather suffer.

04:42.990 --> 04:45.124
Hey, speaking of suffering,

04:45.159 --> 04:48.127
Caleb has developed this
new habit of whistling,

04:48.162 --> 04:49.495
but he doesn't know any tunes.

04:49.529 --> 04:51.864
He just whistles randomly,
all day long.

04:51.899 --> 04:55.167
Well, I'm sure you'll be
fine, and so will my knee.

04:55.201 --> 04:56.668
It just needs time.

04:56.703 --> 04:57.950
Whatever you say.

04:57.970 --> 05:00.972
Hey, Katie, do you wanna come
with Mommy to the cabins?

05:01.007 --> 05:02.440
Oh, before I forget,

05:02.474 --> 05:05.077
are you guys gonna be at,
uh, Ty's convocation?

05:05.111 --> 05:07.312
- Oh, I wouldn't miss it.
- Dad?

05:07.346 --> 05:09.581
Yeah, I'll go.
I mean, I can't guarantee

05:09.615 --> 05:11.849
I won't fall asleep
during the speeches, but...

05:11.883 --> 05:15.086
Oh, Georgie, is um, Stephen
planning on staying for dinner?

05:15.120 --> 05:18.022
Oh, um, I don't know. I'll ask.

05:18.056 --> 05:20.991
- Mommy, look!
- Very sharp.

05:21.026 --> 05:22.359
We are gonna have to call Lisa

05:22.393 --> 05:24.095
and thank her for
the new riding clothes.

05:24.129 --> 05:25.562
You sure look the part.

05:25.597 --> 05:27.832
You know, I think
it might be time

05:27.866 --> 05:29.298
for you to get
some real riding lessons.

05:29.333 --> 05:30.834
What do you think, huh?

05:30.868 --> 05:33.302
Instead of walking around Pogie
all the time?

05:33.337 --> 05:35.038
Please, Mommy!
Please, Mommy! Please!

05:35.072 --> 05:37.874
All right, maybe next week
when Mommy has some free time.

05:37.908 --> 05:39.275
No! Today!

05:39.309 --> 05:41.010
Honey, today,
Mommy is very busy.

05:41.045 --> 05:42.846
I have a lot of work to do.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.313
You know, if she can wait
until tomorrow,

05:44.348 --> 05:45.981
I could give her
a riding lesson.

05:46.015 --> 05:48.617
Please?!
(Tim laughs)

05:50.519 --> 05:52.221
I'm giving Katie
a riding lesson tomorrow,

05:52.255 --> 05:53.989
if you wanna come
be my assistant?

05:54.023 --> 05:55.323
I can't. I have to pack.

05:55.358 --> 05:57.025
Are you going somewhere?

05:57.060 --> 05:59.194
Yeah. To live with my dad
for awhile in Manitoba.

05:59.229 --> 06:00.528
How long is awhile?

06:00.563 --> 06:02.164
Until the end of the summer.

06:02.198 --> 06:05.032
But you have school. You're
gonna miss the last few weeks.

06:05.067 --> 06:06.433
I can do everything online.

06:06.468 --> 06:08.602
(Sighs) But that's not fair.
You live here.

06:08.637 --> 06:10.204
Hudson's your home.

06:10.239 --> 06:12.306
Technically,
I also live with my Dad.

06:12.340 --> 06:15.409
Christmas, summer vacation,
even some weekends.

06:15.443 --> 06:18.345
(Sighs heavily)
And you're okay with that?

06:18.380 --> 06:21.314
I guess. I mean,
I don't really have any choice.

06:21.348 --> 06:24.284
So you like going back
and forth all the time?

06:24.318 --> 06:26.253
Sometimes it sucks, but...

06:26.287 --> 06:28.288
at least I get to see my horse.

06:28.322 --> 06:31.591
(Sighs) My dad wants me to come with
him to Vancouver for the summer,

06:31.625 --> 06:33.960
but there's no way
I'd miss Extreme Team practice

06:33.995 --> 06:36.396
or ditch my friends.

06:36.430 --> 06:39.064
- You think I'm ditching you?
- No, not you.

06:39.099 --> 06:42.634
That's not what I meant.
I... I meant...

06:42.669 --> 06:46.238
I don't know what I meant.
Just... forget I said anything.

06:48.574 --> 06:49.975
I've got a lot of homework
to do,

06:50.010 --> 06:52.178
so I should probably go.

06:52.212 --> 06:56.147
- See you tomorrow.
- Twelve o'clock at Maggie's, right?

06:56.182 --> 06:58.883
Yeah. Come on, Rem. (Whistles)

06:58.918 --> 07:02.153
(Remy pants loudly)

07:02.188 --> 07:04.388
(Stephen sighs)

07:07.092 --> 07:08.459
(Buddy grunts lethargically)

07:08.493 --> 07:10.828
Hey, Buddy...
(Gate clanks and groans)

07:14.598 --> 07:16.499
Buddy? (Claps)

07:18.102 --> 07:19.937
Oh no...

07:19.971 --> 07:23.006
Ty?! Ty, come quick, it's Buddy.

07:23.041 --> 07:26.143
It's okay. Hey, come on.

07:26.177 --> 07:28.878
Something's wrong,
he doesn't look good.

07:28.912 --> 07:30.947
He looks weak.

07:30.981 --> 07:32.882
Hey, Buddy.

07:35.518 --> 07:37.686
- Has he eaten anything today?
- Nothing.

07:37.721 --> 07:40.056
(Restless grunting)

07:40.090 --> 07:41.390
I'm gonna put him on
some fluids.

07:41.424 --> 07:44.260
Okay, I'll stay with him.
It's okay.

07:45.594 --> 07:49.025
You're okay.
You gotta eat something first.

Well, the fluids are helping,

08:37.076 --> 08:38.743
but he still needs to eat,
Georgie.

08:38.778 --> 08:40.678
Well, is there anything
we can do?

08:40.712 --> 08:41.914
(Stall door clanks open)

08:41.948 --> 08:44.682
I'll monitor his vitals,
keep him hydrated,

08:44.717 --> 08:46.218
but at the end of the day, if
Buddy doesn't wanna get better,

08:46.252 --> 08:47.519
(Hooves clop)
there's not much I can do.

08:47.553 --> 08:49.922
Hey, I know Buddy
still has rain rot,

08:49.956 --> 08:53.405
but I was thinking maybe he
could use a friend right now.

08:53.425 --> 08:56.127
It's okay.
He shouldn't be contagious.

08:56.161 --> 08:59.663
I'll keep a close eye
on them both, just in case.

08:59.697 --> 09:02.399
I could... I could put
some honey in his feed.

09:02.434 --> 09:04.502
Yeah. Yeah,
let's give that a try.

09:04.536 --> 09:05.969
Okay.

09:08.206 --> 09:09.740
(Stall door clanks shut,
receding footsteps)

09:12.510 --> 09:15.311
- Hi-yah!
- Come on! (Whistling)

09:15.346 --> 09:17.413
(Cattle moo)

09:18.882 --> 09:21.351
(Whistling) Hup!

09:21.385 --> 09:23.186
- Ow!
- Hup!

09:23.220 --> 09:25.955
(Cattle moo, hooves thunder)

09:28.525 --> 09:30.159
- Ungh!
- Hey, hey, Caleb, what is the hold-up?

09:30.193 --> 09:31.660
- Come on!
- Unnngh!

09:31.694 --> 09:32.894
I can't get it.

09:32.928 --> 09:34.763
Well, put a little elbow
grease into it.

09:34.797 --> 09:39.301
No, the wire loop is stuck.
We're gonna need some tools.

09:39.335 --> 09:41.670
- I got it.
- It's not gonna budge.

09:41.704 --> 09:43.305
I told you, it's too tight.

09:43.339 --> 09:45.973
And what'd I just tell you?
I got it.

09:48.477 --> 09:52.012
(Struggling grunts,
Caleb whistles tunelessly)

09:54.516 --> 09:56.717
Stuck, huh? (Whistles)

09:58.119 --> 10:00.354
Unnnngh!

10:00.389 --> 10:02.622
(Hard shove, Tim groans in pain)

10:02.657 --> 10:04.857
Oh...

10:04.892 --> 10:07.527
- Agh...
- Are you okay?

10:07.562 --> 10:11.464
Yeah... yeah, I'm fine.
(Caleb whistles tunelessly)

10:14.101 --> 10:15.535
You sure?

10:15.570 --> 10:17.637
Yeah, I'm fine. What is that?

10:17.672 --> 10:19.071
- Huh?
- What are you whistling?

10:19.105 --> 10:20.573
Oh, that's uh,
"Go Tell It On the Mountain."

10:20.607 --> 10:23.923
No! No, no it's not.
It's nothing, Caleb.

10:23.943 --> 10:26.678
You're blowing hot air
through your chapped lips

10:26.713 --> 10:28.781
and it's coming out
like horse crap.

10:28.815 --> 10:32.684
So, for the love of God,
please stop whistling!

10:34.954 --> 10:37.722
This is stuck, so we need tools.

10:39.525 --> 10:41.659
(Groans, fencing rattles)

10:43.595 --> 10:46.330
Tools.
Why didn't I think of that?

10:48.026 --> 10:52.836
How ya doing, old boy?
How's retirement treating ya?

10:52.870 --> 10:55.271
Looks like you're living
the life out here.

10:55.306 --> 10:57.707
Nothing to do
but get a belly full of grass

10:57.742 --> 11:00.408
and soak up the sun.

11:02.099 --> 11:04.566
Well, you deserve it.

11:06.050 --> 11:08.852
Yes, you do deserve it.

11:10.854 --> 11:12.988
Okay, well, enough of that.

11:13.022 --> 11:15.257
(Pats Paint)

11:16.726 --> 11:19.962
Go on. You get outta here.

11:22.466 --> 11:23.999
(Grunting)

11:25.802 --> 11:29.270
Paint, just... go on,
get outta here now.

11:34.710 --> 11:37.512
I said go on. Get!

11:37.546 --> 11:39.914
Go on!

11:39.949 --> 11:41.950
Get! (Paint grunts)

11:46.721 --> 11:50.691
(High-pitched whinny)

11:53.294 --> 11:54.995
Good job, Katie.
Sit up nice and tall.

11:55.029 --> 11:57.965
You're looking good, Katie!
(Cell phone rings)

11:57.999 --> 12:00.066
(Phone rings)

12:00.101 --> 12:02.535
Peter, hi.

12:02.569 --> 12:04.871
What about the separation
agreement?

12:04.905 --> 12:07.406
No, no. I sent it
to your lawyer.

12:07.440 --> 12:11.410
Like days ago. They should
definitely have it by now.

12:11.444 --> 12:12.678
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

12:12.713 --> 12:14.747
Maybe they've misplaced it?

12:14.781 --> 12:16.081
(Hard thud, Katie cries) Katie!

12:16.116 --> 12:17.616
Peter, I... I have to call
you back.

12:17.650 --> 12:19.450
Yeah, yeah, no.
That is Katie crying,

12:19.485 --> 12:20.919
but everything is fine.
I'll call you back.

12:20.953 --> 12:23.187
- Owie!
- Oh, what happened?

12:23.222 --> 12:25.423
- What happened?
- I... I don't what happened.

12:25.457 --> 12:27.692
- She must have lost her balance.
- Okay, let's get you up.

12:27.727 --> 12:30.261
Let's get you up. You okay?

12:30.295 --> 12:31.462
Come on, let's go inside
and see how we're doing.

12:31.497 --> 12:32.931
- You okay?
- Yeah.

12:32.965 --> 12:35.733
Yup. You're okay, you're okay.

12:37.235 --> 12:39.469
So what exactly
are we looking for?

12:39.504 --> 12:40.938
I don't know. Anything really

12:40.972 --> 12:44.441
that'll help explain
why Buddy's so depressed.

12:44.475 --> 12:45.809
Did the police say anything

12:45.844 --> 12:47.144
when you reported
the abandoned horses?

12:47.178 --> 12:49.513
No. Just that they would
look into it.

12:49.548 --> 12:52.882
Well, judging from the condition Buddy
was in when Bear lead you here,

12:52.917 --> 12:55.952
they were left to their own
devices for quite awhile.

12:55.986 --> 12:58.220
So either the owner's
completely heartless,

12:58.255 --> 13:01.524
or something terrible
happened here.

13:01.559 --> 13:02.992
Ty.

13:04.595 --> 13:06.162
(Approaching footsteps)

13:06.196 --> 13:08.897
I bet John Stark could tell us
who owns this place.

13:08.932 --> 13:10.331
(Dialing beeps)

13:11.968 --> 13:14.302
(Bag of peas rustles) Okay...

13:21.477 --> 13:23.478
- There we go.
- Thank you.

13:23.512 --> 13:25.913
- All better.
- That horse went so fast!

13:25.948 --> 13:27.848
I know. He gave you
a little scare, didn't he?

13:27.883 --> 13:29.316
- Mm-hmm.
- Here. Muah!

13:29.350 --> 13:31.018
You know what they say,
the best thing to do

13:31.053 --> 13:33.588
when you fall off a horse,
is to get right back on.

13:33.622 --> 13:35.890
I think we've had enough
for today, don't you?

13:35.910 --> 13:36.482
Yeah.

13:36.502 --> 13:37.458
How 'bout you go wash your hands

13:37.492 --> 13:38.726
and then maybe you can
come to Maggie's

13:38.760 --> 13:40.728
- and help Mommy out.
- Okay!

13:40.762 --> 13:43.830
Okay. (Bag of peas rustles)

13:43.864 --> 13:45.665
I don't understand.
Katie is fine.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.400
Why can't we just continue on
with the lesson?

13:47.434 --> 13:50.369
Because I just need to think
about it a little bit, okay?

13:50.404 --> 13:52.438
You know, Katie could've been
seriously injured.

13:52.473 --> 13:53.807
I wouldn't let that happen.

13:53.841 --> 13:55.711
Of course you wouldn't.
Not on purpose.

13:55.731 --> 13:57.978
- But you look away for one second
- I didn't look away.

13:58.012 --> 14:00.545
I'm not saying you did. I'm
just saying accidents happen.

14:00.580 --> 14:02.781
Oh, Lou, don't overreact here.

14:02.816 --> 14:06.299
You know that falling's all part
of learning how to ride a horse.

14:06.319 --> 14:07.519
I'm not overreacting,

14:07.553 --> 14:09.754
and I'm still on board
for the lessons, okay?

14:09.789 --> 14:11.489
Just not today.

14:11.524 --> 14:15.160
Besides, I told Katie
I would take her to the diner.

14:15.194 --> 14:16.961
(Rooster crows)

14:16.995 --> 14:19.964
Hey, Ty, is it okay
if I give Buddy a brush?

14:19.998 --> 14:23.534
Yeah, I think he'd like that. But make sure
you use this brush only on Buddy, okay?

14:23.568 --> 14:25.702
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:25.737 --> 14:27.838
(Phone beeps)
You're doing all right.

14:27.872 --> 14:29.273
(Phone beeps)

14:31.743 --> 14:34.109
So I just heard back from
the real estate agent.

14:34.129 --> 14:34.625
And?

14:34.645 --> 14:37.047
And apparently they dropped
the listing a few months ago

14:37.081 --> 14:39.816
because the seller was being
uncooperative.

14:39.850 --> 14:42.052
- Who was the seller?
- Janet Hargrove.

14:42.086 --> 14:44.620
He gave me her number,
but it wasn't in service.

14:44.655 --> 14:46.089
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

14:46.123 --> 14:47.424
I think I'm gonna head over
there now

14:47.458 --> 14:49.059
and see if there's anything
else I can find.

14:49.093 --> 14:51.093
Uh, I'd come with you,
but I got a shift at the clinic

14:51.127 --> 14:52.661
- I gotta go to right now.
- Okay.

14:52.695 --> 14:54.796
I'll go.

14:54.831 --> 14:56.932
- Perfect! Let's get tacked up.
- Okay.

14:56.967 --> 14:58.500
- See ya.
- See ya.

15:00.003 --> 15:02.104
(Buddy grunts, tack jingles)

15:03.539 --> 15:06.141
(Typing taps)

15:12.281 --> 15:14.449
If you wanna know stuff
about the owner,

15:14.483 --> 15:16.084
don't you think we should
look in the house?

15:16.118 --> 15:18.252
Door's locked. I already tried.

15:21.890 --> 15:23.992
(Doorknob rattles)

15:24.026 --> 15:27.227
I told you! (Chuckles)

15:27.261 --> 15:29.262
(Sighs)

15:34.135 --> 15:36.470
(Lock clicks, window slides)

15:38.006 --> 15:40.773
(Laughs)
Looks like it's our lucky day.

15:40.808 --> 15:42.941
Georgie, what're you doing?
(Laughs)

15:42.976 --> 15:44.776
Georgie, you can't... No!

15:44.811 --> 15:46.745
Don't you go! Georgie, no!

15:46.779 --> 15:48.814
(Loud clatter)

15:48.848 --> 15:51.917
(Thumping) Georgie.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.586
(Door opens) Ah, there, that
wasn't so hard, was it?

15:54.621 --> 15:57.856
You can't just break
into somebody's house.

15:57.891 --> 15:59.590
Technically,
I wasn't breaking in

15:59.625 --> 16:01.026
'cause the window was unlocked.

16:01.060 --> 16:02.960
And it doesn't look like
anyone's been here in ages.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.362
You don't know that for sure.

16:04.397 --> 16:07.765
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

16:07.799 --> 16:09.501
(Sighs)

16:20.065 --> 16:23.200
Looks like whoever used to
live here left in a hurry.

16:24.007 --> 16:25.434
Yeah.

16:30.410 --> 16:33.512
(Floor creaks
as they walk around)

16:35.941 --> 16:38.522
Georgie, look.

16:38.807 --> 16:40.355
(Approaching footsteps)

16:40.389 --> 16:42.457
"Tie Down Roping competitor
Tom Fender

16:42.491 --> 16:45.092

16:45.127 --> 16:47.680
Hey, isn't that Buddy!

16:49.131 --> 16:50.697
Yeah, and...

16:50.732 --> 16:52.199
Tom doesn't look like
the type of guy

16:52.234 --> 16:55.535
that would just abandon
his horses.

17:01.243 --> 17:04.609
Something bad happened,
didn't it?

17:04.645 --> 17:06.179
I don't know.

17:06.213 --> 17:10.583
But I don't think Tom meant
to leave his horses here alone.

17:14.121 --> 17:16.055
(Sighs)

17:21.527 --> 17:24.296
- Let's get outta here.
- What're you doing?

17:24.329 --> 17:27.165
Well, horses can really miss
their owner,

17:27.200 --> 17:30.002
and sometimes it helps having
something familiar close by,

17:30.036 --> 17:32.671
and... I'm just hoping that
maybe Tom's hat

17:32.705 --> 17:34.106
will make Buddy feel
more at home.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.507
But isn't that stealing?

17:36.541 --> 17:38.309
I'm already trespassing,

17:38.343 --> 17:41.012
so I guess we're on a roll.
(Chuckles)

17:41.046 --> 17:42.379
(Floor creaks)

17:42.414 --> 17:44.282

17:46.418 --> 17:48.286
(Approaching footsteps)

17:48.320 --> 17:49.687
Hey!

17:49.721 --> 17:51.655
Hey! That's enough for today.

17:51.690 --> 17:53.824
Take the rest of the night off.

17:54.058 --> 17:54.944
What?

17:54.964 --> 17:57.493
Well, you're both
graduating tomorrow, right?

17:57.528 --> 18:00.096
You should be out celebrating.

18:00.131 --> 18:02.933
Yeah, but I have a bunch
of files to still update.

18:02.967 --> 18:06.102
And I have to prep all of next
week's surgeries, Scott, so.

18:06.137 --> 18:08.271
That can all wait.

18:08.306 --> 18:10.172
I even got you guys a bottle
of champagne

18:10.207 --> 18:12.141
to help you toast the occasion.

18:12.175 --> 18:13.608
(Ty laughs)

18:13.643 --> 18:16.545
Now get out of my clinic

18:16.579 --> 18:19.648
and don't come back
until you've both graduated.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.483
That's an order.
Come on, vamoose!

18:21.517 --> 18:23.652
- Okay. (Laughing)
- Beat it! Adios!

18:23.686 --> 18:25.687
- Okay. All right.
- Let's go, come on!

18:25.722 --> 18:27.322
(Birds chirp)

18:27.356 --> 18:29.324
I missed dinner, didn't I?

18:29.358 --> 18:31.025
I kept a plate warm for you
in the oven.

18:31.060 --> 18:34.896
Oh, thanks. I must have lost
track of time.

18:34.930 --> 18:38.199
- Where were you?
- Just up in the loft.

18:38.234 --> 18:41.002
Picking up where your dad
left off.

18:41.036 --> 18:43.437
Are you sure that's wise
with your knee injury?

18:43.472 --> 18:45.672
Oh, it's not so bad.

18:45.706 --> 18:48.541
I can still help out
around here.

18:48.576 --> 18:53.247
So have you had anymore thoughts
about Katie's riding lessons?

18:53.281 --> 18:55.749
Yes, I have, actually.

18:55.783 --> 18:58.718
I know that you're not going
to agree with me,

18:58.753 --> 19:01.320
but I've decided to put them
on hold,

19:01.355 --> 19:02.922
at least for now.

19:02.956 --> 19:06.359
I respect your decision.
I can't say as I understand it.

19:06.393 --> 19:10.329
Peter and I are still working out
the terms of our separation, okay,

19:10.364 --> 19:12.064
and there are lawyers
involved now,

19:12.099 --> 19:15.101
and I just think it's best to be
cautious about riding lessons

19:15.135 --> 19:17.370
until the details
are ironed out.

19:17.404 --> 19:20.405
What does one have to do
with the other?

19:20.439 --> 19:22.473
I can't give Peter's lawyer
any ammunition

19:22.508 --> 19:24.609
that could limit my custody.

19:24.643 --> 19:27.212
You know, an injury,
even a minor one

19:27.246 --> 19:28.646
could make me look like
a bad parent,

19:28.680 --> 19:30.715
and I-I can't risk that
happening.

19:30.749 --> 19:34.519
Do you really believe
that Peter would do that?

19:34.553 --> 19:36.453
I'm not dealing with
just Peter anymore.

19:36.487 --> 19:38.488
I'm dealing with Peter's lawyer,

19:38.523 --> 19:42.759
and he is gonna play hardball to
get the visitation dates he wants.

19:42.794 --> 19:45.062
I don't know, Lou,

19:45.096 --> 19:48.977
I think you're letting this whole
separation agreement make you paranoid.

19:54.238 --> 19:58.041
Here it is.
Tom Fender's obituary.

19:58.075 --> 20:01.344
It says his only surviving
family is a brother,

20:01.378 --> 20:03.012
doesn't say his name though.

20:03.047 --> 20:04.647
Well, if the brother
was his only family,

20:04.681 --> 20:07.516
then he'd be the one to inherit
the ranch, wouldn't he?

20:07.551 --> 20:09.384
So who's this Janet Hargrove
person?

20:09.419 --> 20:12.321
Yeah, and why is she selling
the ranch?

20:12.355 --> 20:13.755
One thing's for sure,

20:13.789 --> 20:16.158
Tom Fender didn't abandon
his horses.

20:16.192 --> 20:19.094

with Cassandra and Caleb.

21:25.787 --> 21:28.656
- Well, you should go.
- No, I'm...

21:28.690 --> 21:30.658
Cassandra's not exactly
my favourite person,

21:30.692 --> 21:32.893
and I should be here with Buddy.

21:32.927 --> 21:34.961
Well, I can look after Buddy.
You should go party.

21:34.995 --> 21:37.630
Come on, it's not everyday your
husband graduates vet school.

21:37.665 --> 21:40.667
(Sighs heavily) Go!

21:40.701 --> 21:43.169
Hey, Buds. Hi.

21:43.203 --> 21:46.138
No? Come on.

21:46.173 --> 21:47.540
(Door opens and closes)

21:47.575 --> 21:48.941
Peter, hi.

21:48.976 --> 21:52.010
Um, I'm sorry
we got cut off earlier.

21:53.567 --> 21:56.548
I don't know why your lawyers didn't
receive the separation agreement,

21:56.583 --> 22:00.686
but I will send it again,
this time registered mail.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.824
Give me a call back. Bye.

22:05.859 --> 22:07.559
(Phone beeps off,
approaching footsteps)

22:07.594 --> 22:09.059
Hey!

22:10.604 --> 22:15.032
Listen, I wanted to talk to you
about Katie's riding lessons.

22:15.066 --> 22:17.368
I don't think it's a good idea
to continue them,

22:17.403 --> 22:20.805
but I want you to know that I don't
blame you at all for what happened.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.139
That's not what this is about.

22:22.173 --> 22:25.309
- What's it about then?
- It's... (sighs)

22:25.343 --> 22:28.612
- It's a complicated.
- No, it's not complicated.

22:28.646 --> 22:31.748
You think I got distracted and
that's why Katie fell off her horse.

22:31.783 --> 22:34.984
- You don't trust me.
- No. Georgie, that is not...

22:35.019 --> 22:36.753
There's a lot going on
right now.

22:36.788 --> 22:39.623
(Stairs creak underfoot)

22:39.657 --> 22:42.691
So I found out that Buddy's owner
passed away a few months ago.

22:42.726 --> 22:44.259
So I brought a cowboy hat
over to Heartland,

22:44.294 --> 22:45.861
hoping that Buddy would
recognize the scent,

22:45.896 --> 22:47.730
but... nothing.
(Beer bottles clink)

22:47.764 --> 22:49.565
What about Janet Hargrove?

22:49.599 --> 22:50.933
Any luck getting in touch
with her?

22:50.967 --> 22:52.935
No, and I feel like she is
the key to everything,

22:52.969 --> 22:54.570
but... I can't reach her.
(Beer caps pop and clatter)

22:54.604 --> 22:57.406
- Hmm.
- Hi!

22:57.441 --> 22:59.841
Hi! (Giggles)

22:59.875 --> 23:03.344
Uh... I hear you two talking
about work in here...

23:03.378 --> 23:06.714
and that's a big party no-no.
(Sparkler goes out)

23:06.749 --> 23:08.483
Besides, it's time to dance.

23:08.517 --> 23:10.518
- Oh!
- Whoa. D-Definitely no dancing.

23:10.553 --> 23:12.153
- Yes, dancing.
- Camper dance!

23:12.187 --> 23:14.088
It's time to party!

23:14.122 --> 23:15.490
(Music blasts)

23:15.524 --> 23:18.325
Amy and Cass: Woo! Yeah!
- Woo! Woo!

23:18.359 --> 23:19.626
All: (Laughing)

23:19.661 --> 23:21.528
Woo!

23:21.563 --> 23:22.963
Yeah! Woo!

23:22.997 --> 23:26.066
Woo-hoo! (Laughing)

23:26.100 --> 23:28.401
Caleb and Ty: Woo!

23:28.436 --> 23:31.071
You're a good boy, Paint.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.340
That a boy. (Chuckles)

23:36.643 --> 23:40.880
- So, Caleb was a no-show this morning.
- Yeah?

23:40.914 --> 23:43.649
He called and said he was sick.

23:43.684 --> 23:45.751
I think he's hung over.

23:45.786 --> 23:47.453
Any chance you feel up
to helping me out?

23:47.488 --> 23:49.355
Ahh, I don't think so.

23:49.389 --> 23:53.057
I best stay off the knee
for another day or two.

23:53.092 --> 23:54.860
Lou said you were working
on the loft.

23:54.894 --> 23:57.028
- Yeah, so?
- So your knee's kind of selective

23:57.062 --> 23:59.097
about what it can
and can't do, huh?

23:59.131 --> 24:02.534
You know, I was having
such a good morning until now.

24:02.568 --> 24:05.770
Well, I'm just saying,
you know...

24:05.805 --> 24:07.438
Good enough to work on the loft,

24:07.473 --> 24:08.772
you might be good enough
to come into town,

24:08.807 --> 24:10.908
pick up some supplies.

24:12.911 --> 24:14.512
Fine.

24:14.546 --> 24:17.381
(Birds chirp)

24:19.017 --> 24:22.285
(Birds chirp, tack jingles)

24:28.759 --> 24:31.728
(Footsteps clunk on stairs)

24:38.402 --> 24:41.070
(Hat thunks)

24:42.023 --> 24:44.890
(Loud gasp) Give me one good
reason not to call the police!

24:50.986 --> 24:53.183
I am sorry. I didn't know someone was here.

24:53.203 --> 24:54.213
What do you want?

24:54.233 --> 24:57.606
I'm just trying to help the horses
that were abandoned on this ranch.

24:57.640 --> 25:01.220
What happened to them?
Where are they?

25:01.476 --> 25:03.877
- Are you Janet Hargrove?
- I'm calling the police.

25:03.912 --> 25:09.216
Good. Make sure you tell them the
horses you left here nearly died.

25:10.169 --> 25:11.952
(Sighs) I'm not trying
to get you in trouble.

25:11.986 --> 25:15.122
My name is Amy Fleming and
I work at the Heartland Ranch.

25:15.156 --> 25:17.624
Part of what I do is rescue
and rehabilitate horses.

25:17.658 --> 25:19.926
You can look it up online
if you like.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.729
(Sighs) Are the horses okay?

25:22.763 --> 25:24.664
Yeah. I have them.

25:25.995 --> 25:28.768
The one we call Buddy
is in pretty rough shape.

25:30.304 --> 25:32.439
I think he'll make it, but...

25:33.408 --> 25:35.976
I need to know
what happened here.

25:35.996 --> 25:39.211
My Uncle Tom,
those were his horses.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.582
I inherited them, I guess.

25:43.617 --> 25:47.819
Tom's obituary said that he had only one
surviving family member. A brother.

25:47.854 --> 25:49.555
There was no mention of a niece.

25:49.589 --> 25:53.024
That's because I never met
my Uncle Tom.

25:53.058 --> 25:55.560
He and my dad didn't speak.

25:55.594 --> 25:58.696
They must have had some kind
of falling out.

25:58.730 --> 26:02.167
I'll never know the whole story
because... (sighs heavily)

26:02.201 --> 26:06.271
my dad has Alzheimer's.
He's been in a home for years.

26:06.305 --> 26:08.105
I'm sorry.

26:08.140 --> 26:10.907
I have power of attorney, so...

26:10.941 --> 26:13.638
the property belongs to me now.

26:14.479 --> 26:17.481
I've been trying to sell it
for months, but...

26:17.515 --> 26:19.681
nobody wants it.

26:21.052 --> 26:23.820
I'm raising three teenage boys
on my own

26:23.854 --> 26:28.764
and I don't have time
to deal with this place.

26:29.993 --> 26:32.595
I swear, I thought I left
enough hay for the horses.

26:32.629 --> 26:34.497
What else was I supposed to do?

26:34.531 --> 26:36.632
You could've just asked
someone for help.

26:36.667 --> 26:39.702
Ask who? (Laughs)

26:39.736 --> 26:41.204
Who's gonna help me?

26:41.238 --> 26:43.905
Who was around to help
my Uncle Tom?

26:43.939 --> 26:46.474
He died here, all alone.

26:46.509 --> 26:50.478
Nothing but his horses
and guitar to keep him company.

26:53.782 --> 26:55.717
(Birds chirp outside)

26:55.751 --> 26:57.252
(Trailer door opens)

26:58.721 --> 27:00.421
(Door slams shut, Caleb laughs)

27:00.455 --> 27:02.823
Wakey-wakey, Twinkle Toes.
(Groans)

27:02.857 --> 27:05.526
Those were some slick
dance moves last night.

27:05.560 --> 27:10.063
- What time is it right now?
- It's time to graduate.

27:12.066 --> 27:14.702
- What? When did Amy leave?
- I don't know.

27:14.736 --> 27:16.569
(Egg cracks, Ty groans)

27:18.004 --> 27:21.006
Oh man... (Phone beeps on)

27:21.041 --> 27:24.544
Ugh, it's late.
I should've been up hours ago.

27:24.578 --> 27:26.145
I blame your girlfriend
for this.

27:26.179 --> 27:30.283
Well, not to worry, brother.
I got your back covered today.

27:30.317 --> 27:31.984
(Sighs) What is that?

27:32.018 --> 27:33.518
It's an ancient hangover cure

27:33.553 --> 27:35.820
passed down through
the generations of my family.

27:35.855 --> 27:38.490
(Sighs heavily and inhales)

27:38.524 --> 27:39.891
What's in this?

27:39.925 --> 27:41.993
It's probably best
you don't know.

27:43.533 --> 27:45.163
(Sniffs) Oh...
I don't wanna drink that.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.932
Suit yourself. Don't blame me
when you yak all over the Dean.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.501
(Groans) I think
I'll take my chances.

27:51.936 --> 27:54.171
(Sniffs) Whew...

27:54.205 --> 27:55.806
(Sips)

27:55.840 --> 27:57.808
All right, Katie,
what do you want for breakfast?

27:57.842 --> 27:59.777
Toast? Pancakes? Cereal?

27:59.811 --> 28:01.245
Riding lessons.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.881
I don't think that's one
of the major food groups.

28:03.915 --> 28:06.049
Please, Georgie?

28:06.084 --> 28:08.718
Look, Mom said no more
riding lessons.

28:08.753 --> 28:11.187
I know, but Mom is not home...

28:12.723 --> 28:14.424
Let's just stick to breakfast
for now.

28:14.458 --> 28:17.727
Please, Georgie. Please.
Please, Georgie?!

28:17.762 --> 28:19.195
(Sighs)

28:20.731 --> 28:23.600
Good job, Katie.
Sit up nice and tall.

28:23.634 --> 28:26.468
Good. Keep looking forward.
Good!

28:26.503 --> 28:28.236
Look to the sky.

28:28.271 --> 28:31.406
Hey! Katie. Nice job!

28:31.641 --> 28:34.092
These are secret riding lessons,

28:34.112 --> 28:36.578
so don't tell. Shhhh...

28:36.813 --> 28:38.179
My lips are sealed.

28:38.214 --> 28:39.481
I just stopped by
to tell your sister

28:39.516 --> 28:41.983
that I'm heading off
this afternoon.

28:42.017 --> 28:43.985
So that's it?
You're just leaving?

28:44.019 --> 28:46.587
I have to go, Georgie.

28:46.622 --> 28:49.189
Okay. Well, have fun
with your dad.

28:51.793 --> 28:55.362
Well... see ya.

28:57.065 --> 28:59.332
Are you sad, Georgie?

28:59.366 --> 29:02.135
I'm fine. Let's just keep going.

29:02.169 --> 29:03.737
(Running footsteps)

29:05.940 --> 29:07.340
Good...

29:07.374 --> 29:08.942
All right, hold on to the reins.

29:08.976 --> 29:10.710
Oh, is that your two-point.
Good...

29:10.745 --> 29:12.646
- Hey, Stephen.
- Hey.

29:15.449 --> 29:17.449
That's it.

29:17.483 --> 29:19.952
Go faster, Georgie!

29:19.986 --> 29:22.655
(Sighs heavily, hooves thud)

29:25.959 --> 29:28.393
Good job, Katie.

29:29.963 --> 29:31.897
(Gate clanks open)

29:31.932 --> 29:34.799
Uh-oh! You're grounded.

29:34.833 --> 29:36.500
Me? This was your idea.

29:36.535 --> 29:38.169
I'm just a kid.

29:38.203 --> 29:39.604
(Sighs) I'm sorry,

29:39.638 --> 29:42.941
it's just she kept asking
and I know she's ready for this.

29:42.975 --> 29:45.242
- You're right.
- I am?

29:45.277 --> 29:47.779
Yeah. I mean,
I'm not exactly thrilled

29:47.813 --> 29:49.947
that you didn't listen to me,

29:49.981 --> 29:52.583
but Katie is obviously
more than ready.

29:52.617 --> 29:55.318
And you're obviously
a very good teacher.

29:55.352 --> 29:58.841
So... what can I do to help?

29:59.123 --> 30:02.893
- You can take the lead rope.
- All right.

30:02.927 --> 30:04.861
- Ready, Katie?
- Ready!

30:04.896 --> 30:06.729
Come on. (Hooves clop)

30:10.233 --> 30:11.734
Remember your position
in the saddle

30:11.768 --> 30:13.135
and where you're looking?

30:13.169 --> 30:16.639
- Straight ahead.
- That's right. Very good.

30:16.673 --> 30:19.008
Now, Katie, I want you
to hold out your arms

30:19.042 --> 30:22.344
like you're ready lift off
and fly away.

30:22.378 --> 30:23.712
Like this?

30:23.746 --> 30:26.314
Yeah! Just like that.

30:26.348 --> 30:29.183
Look at you, you're a natural.

30:33.589 --> 30:35.189
Why did you park here?

30:35.224 --> 30:37.826
I made you an appointment
to see Dr. Virani.

30:37.860 --> 30:41.662
Geez! I told you,
I don't need to see a doctor!

30:41.696 --> 30:44.397
Jack, you haven't taken
a day off work

30:44.432 --> 30:45.966
for as long as I can remember,

30:46.001 --> 30:47.868
except maybe for your heart
attack.

30:47.902 --> 30:51.404
And now, suddenly, you haven't
been on the job for days?

30:51.439 --> 30:53.507
It's obvious that you gotta
do something about that knee.

30:53.541 --> 30:56.810
It's a rodeo injury. I've been
living with it for years.

30:56.845 --> 31:00.327
There's nothing Dr. Virani or any
other doctor can do about it.

31:00.347 --> 31:04.217
- It's getting worse, Jack.
- No, it's not. Same as it's always been.

31:04.251 --> 31:06.285
So why haven't you been riding?

31:13.293 --> 31:16.796
It's Paint.
It's Paint, isn't it?

31:17.396 --> 31:20.530
Well, look at you,
all perceptive.

31:21.133 --> 31:26.037
I need a little more time before I go
climbing on some other horse, that's all.

31:26.072 --> 31:28.673
Maybe I'm a sentimental
old cowboy,

31:28.707 --> 31:30.608
but that's my business.

31:30.642 --> 31:33.944
And I don't need you
making me feel like a fool.

31:33.979 --> 31:37.114
I don't think you're a fool,
Jack. Come on.

31:37.148 --> 31:39.190
Far from it.

31:39.717 --> 31:41.185
I get it.

31:41.219 --> 31:43.487
I was a wreck when Pegasus died.

31:43.521 --> 31:46.772
But y-you didn't hold that
against me, did you?

31:48.659 --> 31:49.993
Why weren't you just upfront
with me?

31:50.027 --> 31:53.096
I would've understood.
(Car honks in the distance)

31:53.130 --> 31:54.630
You take all the time you need.

31:54.664 --> 31:57.633
That's... that's okay.
(Car rumbles by)

31:59.136 --> 32:01.437
I can put up with Caleb
for a little while.

32:01.471 --> 32:04.307
Good. Then take me home.

32:05.909 --> 32:07.209
(Seat belt clicks)

32:07.243 --> 32:09.244
Agh! Ugh! Oh...

32:10.613 --> 32:13.248
See, you're the one
who needs to see Dr. Virani.

32:13.283 --> 32:15.384
Oh... No, it's just my shoulder,

32:15.418 --> 32:16.851
it pops out every
once in a while.

32:16.886 --> 32:18.453
You know that. (Groans)

32:18.487 --> 32:22.324
- Now where are you going?
- Give me a second!

32:23.992 --> 32:25.526
(Door slams shut)

32:25.560 --> 32:27.161
(Groans)

32:27.195 --> 32:28.862
(Preparatory breaths)

32:30.565 --> 32:32.199
(Grunts)

32:32.234 --> 32:34.235
(Hard clunk) Agh!

32:34.269 --> 32:36.237
Oh... (Groaning)

32:36.271 --> 32:38.139
So did that work?

32:38.173 --> 32:39.540
(Exhales sharply, groans)

32:39.574 --> 32:42.909
(Door opens and slams shut)

32:44.412 --> 32:47.347
You ready to go
to the clinic now?

32:47.381 --> 32:49.449
- Yeah.
- Let's go then.

32:52.753 --> 32:54.321
Ahh! Oh!

32:54.355 --> 32:56.356
You don't have to be a crybaby
about it.

33:01.697 --> 33:03.782
I don't know where everybody disappeared to

33:03.846 --> 33:05.480
but we have to leave for Ty's convocation

33:05.515 --> 33:07.783
in a couple of hours.

33:07.817 --> 33:09.117
By the way,

33:09.151 --> 33:11.520
are you still planning on
inviting Stephen to come?

33:11.554 --> 33:14.523
No. Stephen's leaving today.

33:14.557 --> 33:17.125
He's going to live with his dad
until Fall.

33:17.159 --> 33:18.262
Oh...

33:18.282 --> 33:20.594
It's not fair just 'cause
his parents are divorced

33:20.629 --> 33:23.397
he has to go away
for the whole summer.

33:23.432 --> 33:25.433
When I saw him leaving
earlier he looked upset.

33:25.467 --> 33:27.334
Is that why?

33:27.368 --> 33:29.804
Not exactly.

33:29.824 --> 33:32.640
It's kind of hard to explain.

33:32.674 --> 33:34.308
Try me.
(Sighs)

33:34.342 --> 33:38.147
Okay, well,
he asked me out on like a date.

33:38.167 --> 33:42.043
- Really?
- And I said yes, and then...

33:43.183 --> 33:45.966
he told me he was leaving,
so I kinda cancelled the date.

33:45.986 --> 33:47.354
And I ruined everything

33:47.388 --> 33:49.389
and we never got to say
a proper goodbye.

33:49.423 --> 33:52.358
- Well, it's not too late.
- Well, yeah it is.

33:52.392 --> 33:53.892
He leaves this afternoon
on the bus

33:53.926 --> 33:55.394
and I have to go to Ty's grad.

33:55.428 --> 33:57.529
If we leave right after lunch,
we'll have plenty of time.

33:57.564 --> 33:58.997
I'll give you a ride.

33:59.031 --> 34:01.166
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.701
You're being really cool today.

34:02.736 --> 34:04.270
What's going on?

34:04.304 --> 34:07.038
I'm always cool.
Cool is my middle name.

34:07.073 --> 34:09.007
You just lost most of your cool
points just for saying that.

34:09.041 --> 34:11.656
All right, fine, then I
better quit while I'm ahead.

34:14.146 --> 34:16.341
I have to tell you something.

34:19.351 --> 34:22.520
(Paper crinkles)

34:24.690 --> 34:28.024
The separation agreement, I...
(Sighs heavily)

34:28.058 --> 34:29.493
I took it.

34:31.027 --> 34:32.596
- Georgie...
- I know, I...

34:32.630 --> 34:34.998
I just kinda wanted it
to go away.

34:36.596 --> 34:39.902
Lawyers wouldn't be involved
if it wasn't for me anyways.

34:39.937 --> 34:42.438
And I know I said I didn't wanna
go visit Dad in the summer,

34:42.473 --> 34:46.041
but that's not true.
I do wanna see him, just...

34:46.074 --> 34:48.710
I don't wanna leave this place.

34:48.745 --> 34:50.313
(Cutlery clinks)

34:50.347 --> 34:52.447
I don't want you to leave either.

34:52.482 --> 34:55.318
I know I'm probably not
supposed to say that to you,

34:55.351 --> 34:56.918
but it's the truth.

34:58.262 --> 35:01.856
I love you so much, Georgie,
but so does your father,

35:01.890 --> 35:06.361
and that's why he wants you
to visit him in Vancouver.

35:06.395 --> 35:08.930
And I think you should go.

35:08.964 --> 35:11.098
I know.

35:11.133 --> 35:13.100
I wish I was more like Stephen.

35:13.135 --> 35:16.410
He's way nicer about this
than I am.

35:16.539 --> 35:19.039
He's just used to it.
He's had more practice.

35:19.073 --> 35:23.210
I mean, his parents, they've
been apart for a long time.

35:23.430 --> 35:25.979
We're new at this.

35:26.013 --> 35:28.480
So you're not mad?

35:29.250 --> 35:32.453
No. This, um,
separation agreement

35:32.487 --> 35:34.287
has made me second guess things

35:34.322 --> 35:36.989
I had no business second
guessing.

35:39.860 --> 35:42.995
I'm gonna make you a promise,
Georgie.

35:45.399 --> 35:48.368
Peter and I are going to do
this separation better.

35:50.003 --> 35:52.671
From now on, things are going
to be different.

35:52.705 --> 35:55.039
Okay?

35:55.074 --> 35:57.342
Come here.

35:58.678 --> 36:00.846
(Door opens)

36:04.484 --> 36:08.253
(Groans) I can't believe
I have to have surgery.

36:08.287 --> 36:10.308
It's your fault!

36:10.328 --> 36:12.890
(Laughs) I'm pretty sure you got
no one to blame but yourself.

36:12.924 --> 36:15.559
You could've done something
about that shoulder years ago.

36:15.594 --> 36:18.128
You're too stubborn
for your own good.

36:18.162 --> 36:19.797
Oh really? (Phone rings)

36:19.831 --> 36:23.100
Takes one to know one, Jack.
Hurry up.

36:23.134 --> 36:24.869
- Hello?
- Hey, Grandpa.

36:24.903 --> 36:28.304
Uh-oh! I haven't forgotten
about Ty's graduation gift.

36:28.338 --> 36:30.339
I'm on my way right now
to give you a hand.

36:30.374 --> 36:32.141
That's actually not why
I'm calling.

36:32.175 --> 36:33.576
Um, this might be a bit
of a long shot,

36:33.611 --> 36:36.061
but does the name Tom Fender
ring a bell?

36:36.081 --> 36:39.015
- No, can't say it does.
- Oh, okay. Well...

36:39.049 --> 36:40.650
He passed away a few months ago,

36:40.684 --> 36:43.919
and I think maybe he used
to be on the rodeo circuit.

36:43.953 --> 36:45.972
I just thought maybe
you'd crossed paths with him.

36:45.992 --> 36:48.590
Well, it's possible,
but I'm not sure.

36:48.625 --> 36:51.293
Well, his niece mentioned
that he played the guitar,

36:51.327 --> 36:53.662
and I know that you and Grandma
used to hang out

36:53.696 --> 36:54.897
with a lot of musicians
while you were on the circuit,

36:54.931 --> 36:57.466
so I thought maybe Tom
was one of them.

36:57.500 --> 37:01.001
You know, come to think
of it, there was a guy.

37:01.036 --> 37:02.737
Three-Chord Tommy we called him

37:02.771 --> 37:04.138
'cause that's all he knew.

37:04.172 --> 37:06.541
I think he only knew
three songs, too.

37:06.575 --> 37:09.544
He carried around that guitar
of his like an extra appendage.

37:09.578 --> 37:12.379
Wasn't much good at it
or the rodeo for that matter,

37:12.414 --> 37:14.381
but he sure was fun at a party.

37:14.416 --> 37:17.116
I'm sorry to hear
he passed away.

37:17.451 --> 37:19.252
Well, when you get home,

37:19.286 --> 37:21.287
I have a bit of a favour
to ask you.

37:21.321 --> 37:23.356
It's a little unorthodox.

37:23.390 --> 37:24.858
(Sling thumps)

37:24.892 --> 37:26.626
(Buddy grunts)

37:28.095 --> 37:31.464
Well, what should I play?

37:31.498 --> 37:33.666
I don't know. Anything I guess.

37:33.700 --> 37:35.467
I gotta admit, Amy,

37:35.501 --> 37:38.470
I feel a little stupid playing
for a horse.

37:38.504 --> 37:40.338
I know it's kinda weird.

37:40.373 --> 37:42.574
But I just figure that
a reclusive guy like Tom,

37:42.608 --> 37:44.342
who loved to play the guitar,

37:44.377 --> 37:45.677
would want an audience,

37:45.711 --> 37:48.847
and if all he had were horses...

37:50.183 --> 37:53.684
Grandpa, I just hope
that hearing you play

37:53.718 --> 37:56.353
might make Buddy feel
more at home.

37:56.388 --> 37:58.222
(Strikes a string)
What the heck.

38:00.826 --> 38:02.794
(Starts playing)

38:10.902 --> 38:13.303
(Buddy grunts,
Jack stops playing)

38:13.337 --> 38:17.107
- Should I keep going or...?
- No, he seems pretty indifferent.

38:17.141 --> 38:19.575
Everyone's a critic.
(Both chuckle)

38:19.610 --> 38:21.278
(Neighing restlessly)

38:22.947 --> 38:25.434
Grandpa, look.

38:25.682 --> 38:27.449
I think it actually
might be working.

38:27.483 --> 38:30.519
Do you-do you mind?
Will you keep playing?

38:30.553 --> 38:33.923
(Buddy grunts restlessly,
Jack plays guitar)

38:35.658 --> 38:38.928
You like that?
(Feed shifts, bucket clatters)

38:38.962 --> 38:40.429
(Laughs)

38:40.463 --> 38:42.530
Hey! We were on our way downtown

38:42.564 --> 38:44.432
and we, uh, heard some music.

38:44.466 --> 38:45.834
What's going on?

38:45.868 --> 38:50.131
- I'm playing for horse.
- Oh. Why?

38:50.379 --> 38:53.574
'Cause he appreciates talent.
(Chuckles)

38:53.608 --> 38:57.245
- Is he eating?
- Yeah. Wanna give it a try?

38:57.279 --> 38:58.979
Yeah.

38:59.013 --> 39:01.315
(Amy and Georgie laugh)

39:01.349 --> 39:03.851
- Oh, good boy.
- Good boy, Buddy.

39:11.289 --> 39:13.390
(SUV rumbles to a halt)

39:14.826 --> 39:16.694
You better go.

39:16.728 --> 39:18.761
(People chatter outside)
Hi, how are you?

39:18.795 --> 39:20.697
Okay. (Seat belt unclicks)

39:20.731 --> 39:23.733
(Door opens)

39:23.767 --> 39:25.435
(Door bangs shut)

39:25.469 --> 39:27.937
(People chatter)

39:29.021 --> 39:31.140
I love you, honey.

39:32.843 --> 39:34.276
- Have fun!
- Okay, Mom.

39:34.310 --> 39:35.977
Stephen!

39:36.011 --> 39:38.146
Uh... I'll be right back.

39:38.180 --> 39:40.716
Look, I'm sorry
it was weird earlier.

39:40.750 --> 39:42.016
I get it now. You have to go
with your Dad

39:42.051 --> 39:43.952
and that's just the way it is.

39:43.986 --> 39:45.554
I'm gonna miss you.

39:45.588 --> 39:48.020
I'm gonna miss you too.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.958
Um, I-I should go.

39:51.793 --> 39:52.815
Okay.

39:52.835 --> 39:56.341
Don't think I've forgotten about the lunch.

39:56.361 --> 39:58.165
I'll buy it for you
when I get back.

39:58.199 --> 40:00.000
You won that jump
fair and square.

40:00.034 --> 40:02.737
- Okay, it's a date.
- See you later.

40:02.771 --> 40:05.873
(Birds chirp)

40:11.504 --> 40:13.513
(Envelope rustles)

40:18.819 --> 40:23.089
(Ripping, sighs heavily)

40:24.792 --> 40:26.958
(Chuckles) How do I look?

40:26.993 --> 40:29.027
(Approaching footsteps)

40:30.463 --> 40:33.599
You look very handsome.
(Chuckles)

40:35.101 --> 40:37.002
(Laughs) Maybe a little pale.

40:37.036 --> 40:39.271
Ah... yeah, well,

40:39.306 --> 40:42.807
remind me never to do shots
with Cass ever again.

40:42.841 --> 40:44.108
That's a beautiful dress on you.

40:44.142 --> 40:46.177
Thank you. (Kiss)

40:47.379 --> 40:49.581
Hey...

40:49.615 --> 40:51.649
Buddy, he's looking good.

40:51.683 --> 40:53.384
- Yes.
- Is he eating again now?

40:53.419 --> 40:56.887
- Thanks to Grandpa and his guitar.
- Oh?

40:56.922 --> 40:58.456
I'll explain that on the way
to the auditorium.

40:58.491 --> 41:00.857
But first, there's something
I really wanna show you.

41:00.891 --> 41:03.594
- (Intrigued) Okay.
- Come here.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.929
(Door opens) Okay. (Laughs)

41:05.963 --> 41:07.697
Okay, walk forward.
Watch yourself.

41:07.732 --> 41:09.366
It's really, it's dark in here.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.268
(Both laugh) You ready?

41:11.302 --> 41:12.869
I am ready.

41:12.903 --> 41:15.539
Ta-dah!

41:15.573 --> 41:18.241
(Stunned laugh)

41:18.275 --> 41:20.843
(Laughing)

41:22.246 --> 41:24.013
My own desk.

41:26.617 --> 41:28.284
(Knocks on desk) Wow.

41:31.388 --> 41:33.755
I don't know what to say.

41:33.789 --> 41:35.357
Do you like it?

41:36.719 --> 41:38.630
(Laughs) Yes, I love it.

41:38.650 --> 41:40.762
Thank you, Amy.

41:40.796 --> 41:43.265
(Kiss) You're welcome.

41:43.299 --> 41:46.301
You know, this is more
than just a desk.

41:47.770 --> 41:50.837
This is a new beginning for us.

41:50.872 --> 41:52.873
We always talked about working
together. Do you remember?

41:52.907 --> 41:54.841
You doing the veterinary side of things

41:54.876 --> 41:57.811
and... me dealing with
the behavioral.

41:57.845 --> 42:00.314
Sort of like what we did
with Buddy.

42:00.348 --> 42:03.050
(Both chuckle) Yeah.

42:03.084 --> 42:05.252
(Kiss) Thank you.

42:05.287 --> 42:06.753
You're welcome.

42:06.788 --> 42:08.421
- I wanna try it out.
- Okay.

42:08.455 --> 42:10.256
(Laughing)

42:12.493 --> 42:17.764
(Sighs) This is the best
graduation gift ever.

42:17.784 --> 42:20.633
Well, don't get too comfy, I've
got one more thing to show you.

42:20.668 --> 42:25.737
(Door opens) ♪ Everyone says
that it's plain to see ♪

42:25.771 --> 42:29.874
♪ That everyone knows myself
but me ♪

42:29.909 --> 42:34.379
♪ We try in our own way

42:34.414 --> 42:38.100
♪ A shade of the people
in our dreams ♪

42:38.984 --> 42:40.785
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:40.820 --> 42:44.488
♪ ...people in our dreams,
trying hard... ♪

42:44.523 --> 42:46.357
Caleb: Okay, everyone,
let's-let's get together

42:46.391 --> 42:47.791
and big smiles for this one.

42:47.826 --> 42:49.793
Lou: Ty, and with Scott,
you stand next to Cass.

42:49.828 --> 42:51.462
Tim: Here we go. Come on, Caleb,

42:51.496 --> 42:53.797
my legs are falling asleep.

42:55.100 --> 42:56.667
- Is my tie straight?
- Tim: Yo, come on.

42:56.702 --> 42:59.001
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

42:59.036 --> 43:00.770
- Okay.
- Hey, maybe we could all look at this guy!

43:00.804 --> 43:03.206
- Cheeeeeese!
- Not yet, Katie. Not yet, not yet.

43:03.241 --> 43:04.808
I tell you,
she's got the right idea.

43:04.828 --> 43:07.176
They could've had some food
in that lobby. I'm starving...

43:07.211 --> 43:08.745
Stop your griping over there!

43:08.779 --> 43:11.648
Amy: Okay, well, not yet,
Katie. Just... Cheese!

43:11.682 --> 43:13.015
Cheeeeeese! (Camera snaps)

43:13.050 --> 43:14.384
Tim: Okay, good. Got it?
Amy: Okay, got it?

43:14.418 --> 43:16.184
