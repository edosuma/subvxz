00:01.883 --> 00:03.513
I'm not fucking you.

00:04.510 --> 00:08.269
The missus. She needs someone to
drive her about the next day or so.

00:08.270 --> 00:11.109
Do you wanna be my Driving Miss
Daisy? I'm in love with that girl.

00:11.110 --> 00:13.549
I can't be doing with disloyalty,
Cook. Oh, God!

00:13.550 --> 00:15.709
Keep your fucking mouth shut,
all right?

00:15.710 --> 00:18.429
I don't know a fucking thing
about you. Who the hell are you?

00:18.430 --> 00:20.549
Fuck! You fucked my girl, Jason.

00:20.550 --> 00:24.550
We've got to get the fuck
out of here.

'A man died last night.

00:42.790 --> 00:46.790
'Not a man I liked, or who liked me.

00:47.430 --> 00:51.430
'But he didn't deserve what he got.

00:54.310 --> 00:57.149
'It wasn't good.

00:57.150 --> 01:01.149
'He wasn't surrounded
by his nearest and dearest.

01:01.150 --> 01:02.429
'He didn't pass away

'peacefully in his sleep.

But you don't.

Really seen it.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.189
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

01:51.190 --> 01:52.669
Are you sure?

01:52.670 --> 01:56.269
I came here every summer
for, like, my whole life. I'm sure.

01:56.270 --> 01:58.229
Is it safe here?

01:58.230 --> 02:01.949
I think so.

02:01.950 --> 02:05.950
Well?

02:14.190 --> 02:16.869
This is so fucked up.
Why are we here?

02:16.870 --> 02:19.349
Oh, I'm sorry my country house
in the middle of nowhere

02:19.350 --> 02:22.189
that no-one can find
isn't good enough for you.

02:22.190 --> 02:26.190
Dickhead.

02:32.870 --> 02:36.870
It's here somewhere.

02:37.470 --> 02:40.589
Fuck's sake.

02:40.590 --> 02:44.590
Hang on.

02:54.230 --> 02:55.709
It's nice.

02:55.710 --> 02:57.949
Oh, I'm so glad you like it!

02:57.950 --> 02:59.709
Shut up, girls, right?

02:59.710 --> 03:02.149
What's important
is that we're off the grid.

03:02.150 --> 03:04.149
So we stay here until it pipes down,
yeah?

03:04.150 --> 03:07.949
Yeah? When will that be exactly?

03:07.950 --> 03:10.789
Whoever's down there, I want you
to know, I've got a gun...

03:10.790 --> 03:14.790
Fuck! It's me, Emma!

03:22.550 --> 03:25.149
Emma?

03:25.150 --> 03:28.829
Hi, Mum. Dad.

03:28.830 --> 03:30.749
What on earth are you doing here?

03:30.750 --> 03:33.509
These are my friends,
Cook and Charlie. We just...

03:33.510 --> 03:36.829
came down from the city, you know,
bit of a break, bit of a holiday.

03:36.830 --> 03:37.949
Great!

03:37.950 --> 03:39.829
Look, I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

03:39.830 --> 03:41.709
Well, of course you can stay.

03:41.710 --> 03:45.710
It was just a bit of a shock,
it's all. It... it's fine.

03:47.590 --> 03:50.789
We haven't heard a word from you
for two years.

03:50.790 --> 03:52.389
And...?

03:52.390 --> 03:54.469
We thought you were never
coming back.

03:54.470 --> 03:57.589
What makes you think
you can just...? Mike!

03:57.590 --> 04:01.590
We can talk about it tomorrow, OK?

04:03.070 --> 04:07.070
I'll just go and make up some beds.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.029
Mum.

04:11.030 --> 04:13.269
Can you please tell Dad
to stop pointing his gun at me?

04:13.270 --> 04:17.269
Mike! Will you give me a hand?

04:28.870 --> 04:30.549
OK, we're leaving.
Whoa, whoa, Ems...

04:30.550 --> 04:32.309
Ems, there's nowhere else to go.

04:32.310 --> 04:34.149
Please don't make me
stay here, Cook.

04:34.150 --> 04:36.829
I'm sorry, Emma.

04:36.830 --> 04:39.869
Not long. OK?

04:39.870 --> 04:43.870
Not long.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.149
Are we gonna sleep,

05:38.150 --> 05:42.150
or are you gonna spend the entire
night eye-fucking yourself?

05:46.550 --> 05:50.550
Why are you in my life, Charlie?

06:16.270 --> 06:20.270
Did you fuck him?

06:23.310 --> 06:27.310
Oh, I fuck everyone.

06:59.710 --> 07:02.229
You tell me what happened
between you and her now.

07:02.230 --> 07:05.389
Cos I wanna know
if she's having a laugh.

07:05.390 --> 07:07.709
Emma...

07:07.710 --> 07:08.989
Not now, please.

07:08.990 --> 07:12.990
No, you tell me. You don't lie.

07:25.310 --> 07:26.629
Once.

07:26.630 --> 07:28.229
I fucked up.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.389
Yeah, you really did.

07:29.390 --> 07:31.029
I'm sorry.

07:31.030 --> 07:32.709
In the morning, I want her gone.

07:32.710 --> 07:34.949
Away from here. Away from me.
You tell her.

07:34.950 --> 07:36.709
Ems, come on...
You're supposed to be

07:36.710 --> 07:39.869
this big-shot drug dealer,
hardman, badass.

07:39.870 --> 07:41.229
You're supposed to be strong.

07:41.230 --> 07:42.869
I'm trying.

07:42.870 --> 07:45.189
You stupid twat!

07:45.190 --> 07:46.709
Why don't you fight for something?

07:46.710 --> 07:49.309
Fight for me. Don't just... lie down.

07:49.310 --> 07:51.829
I dunno what else to do, Emma.

07:51.830 --> 07:53.749
He's coming for us, you know.
No, not for me.

07:53.750 --> 07:55.149
I'm not too sure about that, Ems.

07:55.150 --> 07:57.229
I can't just feed her
to the fucking crocodiles.

07:57.230 --> 07:59.109
No, girls like her,
they get what they want.

07:59.110 --> 08:01.789
It'll happen again, won't it?
No, Ems. No.

08:01.790 --> 08:03.749
You want her, you just take her.
Yeah?

08:03.750 --> 08:07.509
You leave
and you don't fucking come back.

08:07.510 --> 08:11.509
No...

08:11.510 --> 08:15.510
Just go with her.

09:32.550 --> 09:34.869
No...

09:34.870 --> 09:38.870
No. No.

09:40.510 --> 09:43.589
Babes...

09:43.590 --> 09:47.069
Ems...

09:47.070 --> 09:50.109
Even your dick tells lies.

09:50.110 --> 09:52.029
Fuck this.

09:52.030 --> 09:53.829
Emma!

09:53.830 --> 09:57.829
Babes! Fuck's sake!

09:57.830 --> 09:59.869
Fucking hell!

09:59.870 --> 10:02.749
Ems, man!

10:02.750 --> 10:04.606
Ems... Ems!

10:39.129 --> 10:43.429
So, Cook! What do you do?
I work in events.

10:43.474 --> 10:44.694
Ah. Like parties?

10:44.701 --> 10:46.481
Mmm. Yeah. Something like that.

10:46.502 --> 10:48.301
That sounds pretty exciting.
Mum...

10:48.302 --> 10:51.462
I'm just asking, Ems...

10:51.520 --> 10:53.720
Are you still working at
the...? Petrol station.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.479
Something you want to say, Dad?

10:57.480 --> 10:59.880
You always make such
great life choices!

10:59.953 --> 11:03.953
I do what I want.

11:08.633 --> 11:10.693
Can I get anyone a drink, or...?
Yeah, I'll give you a hand.

11:10.709 --> 11:14.709
No, it's OK. I'll help him.

11:15.109 --> 11:19.109
Fuck's sake.

11:21.069 --> 11:24.748
What do you do, Charlie?

11:24.749 --> 11:26.908
Er, entertainment.

11:26.909 --> 11:28.388
Right.

11:28.389 --> 11:31.868
At the parties?

11:31.869 --> 11:35.869
Anywhere.

11:38.109 --> 11:40.908
Why don't you tell her to take
the car and go?

11:40.909 --> 11:44.228
- I'm getting drinks.
- OK, who's next?

11:44.229 --> 11:46.708
Yes, mate, can I just get two
pints of bitter and...?

11:46.709 --> 11:48.548
Hey, you've just pushed in
there, pal!

11:48.549 --> 11:50.588
All right, dickhead. And a large
glass of white wine.

11:50.589 --> 11:52.588
What did you just call me, mate?
Just don't, all right?

11:52.589 --> 11:55.868
Hey, say it again, pal! Come
again, mate, go on.

11:55.869 --> 11:58.508
A dickhead.

11:58.509 --> 12:02.108
Dick... head? Cook...

12:02.109 --> 12:06.109
Like your head is a dick.
Cook.

12:06.589 --> 12:10.228
Cook!

12:10.229 --> 12:11.748
What's going on?

12:11.749 --> 12:14.228
Nothing. We're getting drinks.

12:14.229 --> 12:16.948
Hey. All right, darling? Listen, are
you with this moron?

12:16.949 --> 12:18.148
Oi! What the fuck?!

12:18.149 --> 12:22.149
Step the fuck down, mate, before...

12:51.349 --> 12:55.268
We've been going to that pub for
years! People know us there!

12:55.269 --> 12:56.588
We said we're sorry, Dad!

12:56.589 --> 12:58.748
The guy was a dick!
We're going home! OK?!

12:58.749 --> 13:01.708
Let her deal with whatever
mess she's got herself into!

13:01.709 --> 13:05.709
Go and talk to him, please.

13:11.109 --> 13:15.109
Jesus Christ!

14:00.229 --> 14:04.229
Hello, princess.

14:05.549 --> 14:08.668
It's OK, mate.
I come in peace.

14:08.669 --> 14:12.669
I'd wave a white flag, but I'm fresh
out, you know what I mean?

14:18.109 --> 14:20.068
You shoulda gone to Spain
or some shit.

14:20.069 --> 14:24.069
Louie...
It's all right, man. Serious.

14:24.909 --> 14:28.909
I understand.

14:30.389 --> 14:32.268
How did you find us?

14:32.269 --> 14:36.268
This car you drive. I've got a
little anti-theft gizmo in it.

14:36.269 --> 14:39.628
Got an app for that shit. Easy-peasy.
X marks the spot.

14:39.629 --> 14:43.629
Can we talk about this, Louie,
or what?

14:45.469 --> 14:48.708
Cook, man, of course we can.

14:48.709 --> 14:52.709
We just need a little
heart-to-heart, that's all.

14:54.989 --> 14:58.989
You'd better introduce me to your
friends. I don't wanna be rude.

15:02.029 --> 15:05.028
Chill.

15:05.029 --> 15:09.029
Come on.

15:12.429 --> 15:15.388
Nice.

15:15.389 --> 15:19.389
Nice place.

15:20.109 --> 15:21.828
Where is she?

15:21.829 --> 15:23.668
She's not here, Louie.

15:23.669 --> 15:25.988
You let little hot-tits
slide through your fingers?

15:25.989 --> 15:28.388
That's careless, man.

15:28.389 --> 15:29.908
Ems, thanks.

15:29.909 --> 15:33.909
As long as you lock the door behind
you and put the key in the...

15:35.789 --> 15:36.868
Hello?

15:36.869 --> 15:40.869
Oh, sorry to just drop by like this.
Louie. Very nice to meet you.

15:42.389 --> 15:45.868
Annabel. I'm sorry, I don't...

15:45.869 --> 15:49.028
They not tell you about me?
I'm Charlie's boyfriend.

15:49.029 --> 15:50.828
Just came to make sure she
was OK.

15:50.829 --> 15:52.548
I came to pick her up.
Yeah. That's it.

15:52.549 --> 15:56.549
My parents are just leaving,
actually.

15:59.069 --> 16:02.148
Sorry.
I, er... I just charged in.

16:02.149 --> 16:06.149
You do what you need to. I'm
sorry.

16:06.229 --> 16:07.468
I'll come out with you.

16:07.469 --> 16:10.788
It's nice to meet you, Louie.
Likewise.

16:10.789 --> 16:14.789
Here, I'll take that.
Bye.

16:17.389 --> 16:19.909
How many more of
your friends...?

16:21.549 --> 16:25.549
Parents, eh? Drive you nuts!

16:26.549 --> 16:30.549
What you gonna do?

16:32.669 --> 16:35.668
Yeah, good question,
good question.

16:35.669 --> 16:38.388
I guess I hadn't thought that
far ahead.

16:38.389 --> 16:41.628
Thank God, are they gone...?

16:41.629 --> 16:45.629
Hi, Charlie.

16:48.189 --> 16:49.668
Come on!

16:49.669 --> 16:53.669
I'm trying, I'm trying.

16:55.669 --> 16:58.028
I understand you got scared.
It's OK.

16:58.029 --> 17:01.669
I just want you back, OK?
I love you.

17:03.069 --> 17:06.907
I'm serious, no bullshit.
It doesn't matter what you did.

17:06.909 --> 17:09.228
What I did?

17:09.229 --> 17:13.229
Louie, you killed Jason.

17:14.069 --> 17:16.147
That's... how'd they say...?

17:16.148 --> 17:18.788
Academic. It is peripheral.

17:18.789 --> 17:22.789
But what we've got, what we had, was
so much more than any of that shit.

17:24.989 --> 17:27.508
You gonna tell me that means nothing
to you anymore?

17:27.509 --> 17:29.508
You gonna tell me that?
Louie...

17:29.509 --> 17:30.948
Mm-hm.

17:30.949 --> 17:34.949
Nobody's going to say anything.

17:35.029 --> 17:37.228
So please...

17:37.229 --> 17:41.229
just fuck off.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.508
OK.

17:45.509 --> 17:48.228
OK.

17:48.229 --> 17:52.229
I think you should go, Louie.

17:54.189 --> 17:56.548
Yeah.

17:56.549 --> 18:00.549
Suppose I'd better do one.

18:13.229 --> 18:15.428
Hello. Yeah.

18:15.429 --> 18:17.108
Ready?
Yeah, I'm ready now.

18:17.109 --> 18:19.789
Mm-hm.

18:24.429 --> 18:27.468
You broke my heart, babe.

18:27.469 --> 18:31.309
Snap. Fucking snap.

18:59.709 --> 19:03.709
Is that it? It's over?

19:06.029 --> 19:08.689
Get the stuff together.
We're going.

19:08.776 --> 19:12.776
Get the fucking stuff!

19:15.216 --> 19:16.627
We're walking.

19:46.740 --> 19:49.859
You know
where I'd rather be right now?

19:49.860 --> 19:51.220
I'll tell you where.

19:51.296 --> 19:54.415
Fucking anywhere, rather than stuck
out here in the middle of

19:54.416 --> 19:57.535
the arse end of the edge of
the fucking universe.

19:57.536 --> 19:59.695
You had your chance to leave!
You should have taken it!

19:59.696 --> 20:01.535
What, you think I should have gone
with him?!

20:01.536 --> 20:02.976
Shut up, girls!
You think I should have gone with

20:03.052 --> 20:04.532
that murdering sack of shit?!
Hey, I'm talking to you!

20:04.547 --> 20:06.506
Piss off, whore! You did all
of this! Oh, why?!

20:06.507 --> 20:07.786
Girls!

20:07.787 --> 20:11.787
Shut up, girls!

20:15.946 --> 20:16.882
Mum.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.282
Emma, wait!

20:19.283 --> 20:21.122
Mum!

20:21.123 --> 20:25.123
Mum!

20:26.603 --> 20:30.042
Where are they? Mum?!

20:30.043 --> 20:32.402
Dad?!

20:32.403 --> 20:34.642
Cook?!

20:34.643 --> 20:38.643
What the fuck's going on?!

20:40.003 --> 20:44.003
I don't know.

20:44.723 --> 20:48.723
Mum! Dad!

20:50.363 --> 20:54.363
What's happened?!
Something's happened!

20:58.363 --> 21:02.322
Mum!

21:02.323 --> 21:06.002
Where's the gun?
What? What are you saying?

21:06.003 --> 21:10.003
He had a gun. Where is it?

21:14.403 --> 21:16.242
We need to get off the road.

21:16.243 --> 21:18.722
Mum?! Mum!
Emma, don't.

21:18.723 --> 21:22.642
Whoa, whoa, shush. He's got them,
he's got them. I know, I know.

21:22.643 --> 21:24.202
Emma, please.
No!

21:24.203 --> 21:28.203
Emma, please. Shush, shush.
Get off me!

21:39.923 --> 21:43.923
Fuck off! What's going on?!
Get off me!

21:45.043 --> 21:48.002
Where are we going?!

21:48.003 --> 21:51.322
We need to go back, Cook!

21:51.323 --> 21:55.323
Cook, get off!

22:00.123 --> 22:01.682
No! We need to go back!

22:01.683 --> 22:03.082
Stay here a second.

22:03.083 --> 22:06.362
We need to find them!
She needs to shut up!

22:06.363 --> 22:09.842
They've done something to them!
We need to do something!

22:09.843 --> 22:11.762
Emma! He'll hear you!

22:11.763 --> 22:15.763
I'm sorry.

22:16.283 --> 22:20.283
Emma?

22:20.563 --> 22:24.362
What's that man done?

22:24.363 --> 22:26.802
What has he done?!
Ems, babe, listen.

22:26.803 --> 22:30.803
Ems, babe. Listen, I promise you,
everything will be OK. All right?

22:32.443 --> 22:33.602
What's he done to them?

22:33.603 --> 22:35.162
He's just keeping hold of them
to scare us.

22:35.163 --> 22:38.042
I promise you he'll let them go.
All right?

22:38.043 --> 22:41.962
Now, you just need to be brave now,
OK? Ems?

22:41.963 --> 22:43.722
Yeah?

22:43.723 --> 22:47.723
I promise you, everything will be
fine.

22:49.963 --> 22:51.082
Stay with her.

22:51.083 --> 22:52.442
Where are you going?
You're leaving us?!

22:52.443 --> 22:56.443
I'm just gonna take a look. I
promise I'll come straight back, OK?

24:34.883 --> 24:38.883
Was that...?
Come on, we've got to go!

25:58.323 --> 26:01.162
Oh! Oh, God!

26:01.163 --> 26:02.922
Emma!
Emma, please, sit down!

26:02.923 --> 26:05.042
You just need to calm down.

26:05.043 --> 26:07.162
Cook, Cook, get her to sit down.
Everything's going to be OK.

26:07.163 --> 26:11.002
Emma, take a couple of these, yeah?

26:11.003 --> 26:14.042
It'll calm you down. It's Valium.

26:14.043 --> 26:16.882
OK?

26:16.883 --> 26:20.682
Just stay quiet.
He's going to hear you.

26:20.683 --> 26:23.802
Emma, everything's going to be
all right.

26:23.803 --> 26:27.202
I don't know about you, Cook,
but I am fucking terrified.

26:27.203 --> 26:30.722
Shhhh.

26:30.723 --> 26:34.723
It's OK, Emma. It's OK.

26:37.083 --> 26:41.083
So, what, we're just waiting here
until morning, then?

26:51.123 --> 26:54.042
OK, Emma, come on now, girl.

26:54.043 --> 26:58.043
It's OK, Emma, you're all right.

27:48.843 --> 27:52.843
She's still out.
Shh.

27:57.603 --> 28:01.603
You OK?
Yeah.

28:06.243 --> 28:10.243
I'm sorry.

28:11.803 --> 28:15.803
For all this.

28:18.283 --> 28:22.283
I wanted you.
It's OK.

28:25.523 --> 28:29.523
Do you think Jason knew what was
happening to him?

28:30.003 --> 28:34.003
When they drowned him?

28:34.923 --> 28:38.923
Do you think he felt it all?
I don't know, babes.

28:46.083 --> 28:50.083
How long do we have to go on?

28:52.123 --> 28:56.123
Till it's finished.

28:56.803 --> 29:00.803
I'm cold.

29:28.403 --> 29:32.403
We'll get some help tomorrow.

29:32.803 --> 29:35.202
You can't do that.

29:35.203 --> 29:39.203
You're already on the run.

29:42.203 --> 29:46.203
We need to kill him.

29:46.443 --> 29:50.443
I ain't killing nobody.

29:50.523 --> 29:54.482
I've been thinking about it.

29:54.483 --> 29:58.483
How I would do it.

29:59.683 --> 30:03.683
You're helping me.

30:04.643 --> 30:08.643
You're holding him down.

30:08.843 --> 30:12.362
We've got something.

30:12.363 --> 30:16.363
A branch.

30:16.763 --> 30:20.763
And I just put it on his throat.

30:21.043 --> 30:24.562
And crush it.

30:24.563 --> 30:28.563
And I just keep on pushing it down.

30:29.843 --> 30:33.843
I just keep on.

30:34.003 --> 30:38.003
Until he's dead.

30:38.883 --> 30:42.883
Did it feel good when you did that
to someone?

30:44.683 --> 30:47.722
No.

30:47.723 --> 30:51.723
It felt like nothing.

30:52.483 --> 30:56.483
And then you've got to
live with this nothing.

30:56.923 --> 31:00.923
It's just shit.

31:02.763 --> 31:06.763
Ah!

31:15.283 --> 31:19.283
Choose me.

31:25.443 --> 31:29.443
Choose me.

32:47.443 --> 32:51.402
Jason?

32:51.403 --> 32:55.403
All right, mate?

32:57.843 --> 33:01.843
Been missing you.
Yeah, you too, man.

33:02.643 --> 33:06.643
Cool.

33:18.523 --> 33:22.523
So, where are those sweet ladies?

33:24.083 --> 33:28.083
In there, asleep.

33:31.963 --> 33:35.963
I reckon you leave them.
You keep running.

33:37.523 --> 33:40.442
It's what you're best at.

33:40.443 --> 33:44.443
Mate?

33:51.203 --> 33:55.203
Come on. Let's go.

34:18.043 --> 34:22.043
OK.

34:23.003 --> 34:27.003
Oh, fuck me.

34:35.963 --> 34:38.681
Emma?

34:38.683 --> 34:42.683
Emma?

34:43.402 --> 34:47.402
Where is she?

34:51.963 --> 34:55.402
Emma!

34:55.402 --> 34:59.202
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

34:59.203 --> 35:03.203
Fuck!

35:09.563 --> 35:10.922
Cook!
She's gone!

35:10.923 --> 35:13.402
You've got to be quiet.
She's gone!

35:13.403 --> 35:17.403
Emma! Emma!

35:17.923 --> 35:20.922
Cook, please, he'll hear you.

35:20.923 --> 35:23.082
Emma, where are you?!

35:23.083 --> 35:24.602
Emma!

35:24.603 --> 35:26.242
Get the fuck off me!

35:26.243 --> 35:29.002
Emma!
Cook, he'll hear you!

35:29.003 --> 35:31.802
Please. Be quiet.
Emma!

35:31.803 --> 35:35.803
For fuck's sake, please, Cook!
Emma!

35:36.083 --> 35:38.282
Emma, where are you?!

35:38.283 --> 35:40.092
Emma!

38:32.758 --> 38:35.598
Mate, just...

38:35.870 --> 38:39.870
There's fine.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.492
- Louie?
- Yes, mate?

38:49.534 --> 38:51.213
Please, don't kill anyone else
now.

38:51.214 --> 38:53.133
All right?

38:53.134 --> 38:55.493
Just leave it now, please.

38:55.494 --> 38:58.773
I never thought I'd see this.

38:58.774 --> 39:00.373
You begging for your life,
Cooko?

39:00.374 --> 39:03.173
Nah, you do what you've got
to do with me, mate.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.853
To be honest,
I think I've had it creeping up
on me.

39:05.854 --> 39:08.573
Well, who cares?

39:08.574 --> 39:11.573
I'm still going to kill you,
though.

39:11.574 --> 39:15.173
Hey, at least I had fun
fucking your missus, though.

39:15.174 --> 39:19.174
Still got that, ain't I?

39:19.374 --> 39:22.453
- What?
- Yeah, straight in her sweet
spot, mate.

39:22.454 --> 39:25.413
Bawling my name out, she
was, a fucking star. You listening?

39:25.414 --> 39:26.813
Yeah.

39:26.814 --> 39:28.893
Could have been mates,
Louie, you were right,

39:28.894 --> 39:31.853
but now you're on the wrong
side of me, aren't you?

39:31.854 --> 39:33.213
So?

39:33.214 --> 39:35.613
Mistake.

39:35.614 --> 39:39.614
Go on, Charlie, twat him!

40:42.414 --> 40:44.613
What? You think you could
kill me?

40:44.614 --> 40:48.093
I'm fucking Cook, mate!
Fucking Cook!

40:48.094 --> 40:51.293
What's my name? Go on.

40:51.294 --> 40:53.254
Say me fucking name, go on!

41:00.254 --> 41:02.493
Nah.

41:02.494 --> 41:06.494
Oi, oi, oi, oi,
this is for my girlfriend.

41:23.414 --> 41:27.414
Do it.

41:29.094 --> 41:33.094
What are you waiting for?!

41:42.094 --> 41:46.094
We're done.

42:18.254 --> 42:21.253
I didn't do it.

42:21.254 --> 42:25.254
I know. I know.

42:51.894 --> 42:54.333
Oi, Louie, wake up.

42:54.334 --> 42:56.693
Louie, wake up.

42:56.694 --> 43:00.573
Oi! Wake up!

43:00.574 --> 43:04.053
Hey.

43:04.054 --> 43:07.933
The police are going to be
here pretty soon, mate.

43:07.934 --> 43:10.693
You tell them whatever you
want, OK?

43:10.694 --> 43:14.694
Tell them you killed someone.

43:25.494 --> 43:29.133
You ready?

43:29.134 --> 43:33.134
Just drive, yeah?

43:33.574 --> 43:36.573
Keep going, don't stop.

43:36.574 --> 43:40.253
Drive until the end of the day,
then dump the car.

43:40.254 --> 43:42.293
Police are gonna want to talk
to you.

43:42.294 --> 43:46.294
Don't.

43:47.094 --> 43:50.173
Just disappear.

43:50.174 --> 43:52.213
Disappear?

43:52.214 --> 43:53.533
Yeah.

43:53.534 --> 43:57.534
It's easy.

43:58.574 --> 44:02.574
Will I see you again?

44:05.894 --> 44:09.894
Where are you going?

44:14.854 --> 44:18.854
- Bye.
- Bye.

44:55.174 --> 44:59.174
Emma.

45:04.894 --> 45:06.813
You think you know death.

45:06.814 --> 45:08.013
But you don't.

45:08.014 --> 45:09.973
Not until you've seen it.

45:09.974 --> 45:13.974
Really seen it.

45:15.014 --> 45:19.014
And it gets under your skin
and lives inside you.

45:19.654 --> 45:21.733
You also think you know life.

45:21.734 --> 45:25.734
You stand on the edge of
things and watch it go by, but
you're not living it.

45:25.854 --> 45:27.813
Not really.

45:27.814 --> 45:29.813
You're just a tourist.

45:29.814 --> 45:31.893
A ghost.

45:31.894 --> 45:33.813
And then you see it.

45:33.814 --> 45:36.053
Really see it.

45:36.054 --> 45:40.054
And it gets under your skin
and lives inside you, and
there's no escape.

45:40.414 --> 45:43.413
There's nothing to be done,
and you know what?

45:43.414 --> 45:47.414
It's good.
It's a good thing.

45:49.934 --> 45:53.934
And that's all I've got to say
about it.
