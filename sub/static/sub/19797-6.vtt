00:44.901 --> 00:46.701
For you. Give me a call.

00:46.767 --> 00:48.467
One for you.

00:48.534 --> 00:51.200
DAVID: I don't look upon this like it's the end.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.300
I look upon it like it's moving on.

00:54.367 --> 00:57.667
You know, it's almost like my work here's done.

00:57.734 --> 01:01.968
You know, I can't imagine Jesus going,

01:02.033 --> 01:05.734
"Oh, I've told a few people here in Bethlehem I'm the Son of God.

01:05.801 --> 01:07.701
"Can I just stay here with Mum and Dad now?"

01:07.767 --> 01:10.801
No. You've got to move on. You've got to spread the word.

01:10.868 --> 01:14.334
You know, you've got to go to Nazareth, please.

01:14.400 --> 01:18.300
And that's... Very much like me.

01:19.901 --> 01:22.334
My world does not end with these four walls.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.300
Slough's a big place, you know.

01:24.367 --> 01:27.801
And when I finish with Slough, there's Reading, Aldershot, Bracknell.

01:27.868 --> 01:30.467
You know, I've got Didcot, Yateley.

01:30.534 --> 01:33.601
You know, Winnersh, Taplow.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.100
You know, because I am my own...

01:36.167 --> 01:38.500
My own boss, I can... Burghfield.

01:39.701 --> 01:41.868
I can wake up one morning and go,

01:41.934 --> 01:44.834
"Oh, I don't feel like working today. Can I just stay in bed?

01:44.901 --> 01:46.868
"Oh, I don't know. Better ask the boss."

01:46.934 --> 01:49.701
"David, can I stay in bed all day?" "Yes, you can, David."

02:02.801 --> 02:05.400
-Well, different, certainly. -Sadder, sadder.

02:05.467 --> 02:08.801
But I'm telling this to everyone.

02:08.868 --> 02:11.234
I do not want you going,

02:11.300 --> 02:13.367

02:19.767 --> 02:22.834
Oh, that's great. No. That's a load off my mind.

-You were bricking it, you know. -I was, yes.

02:38.133 --> 02:41.601
All I'm saying is I don't want you... I want to leave...

02:41.667 --> 02:44.434

02:53.767 --> 02:55.300
No, it was a team effort.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.200
Yep. Yeah, well, that's what I thought.

02:59.267 --> 03:00.968
We'll be fine. We're absolutely fine.

03:36.567 --> 03:38.634
-My Mum and Dad phoned me last night. -Mmm-hmm.

03:38.701 --> 03:43.367
Um... Okay, basically, we have this beautiful little cottage in The New Forest.

03:43.434 --> 03:47.734
-Hmm. -Once a year, we kind of organise this family do,

03:47.801 --> 03:50.701
and my Mum and Dad wanted to know whether we'd like to come.

03:50.767 --> 03:53.634
Oh. Oh, shit, I can't. When is it?

03:53.701 --> 03:55.434
Oh, we'll have about, like, a week, two weeks' notice.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.334
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:58.634 --> 04:00.234
It'll be on the weekend, fella.

04:00.300 --> 04:03.701
That's what... Yeah. That's tricky. That's the problem.

04:03.767 --> 04:06.801
-Potentially... -Well, I kind of told them that we'd go.

04:06.868 --> 04:09.701

Ben, are you wondering who that is?

05:35.167 --> 05:36.968
Well, I'll tell you all.

Well, my train doesn't leave till 1:30,

06:04.667 --> 06:06.234
so I'll hang about, if that's okay, and have a chat with some of them.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.667

06:08.734 --> 06:10.267
I'm not going to put anything nasty in.

06:10.334 --> 06:12.334
Well, they won't say anything nasty. So...

06:14.000 --> 06:15.100
Okay.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.100
Right, so would you like to tell me about

06:18.167 --> 06:20.133
your individual outlook on management?

06:20.200 --> 06:23.067
Sure, um, put...

06:23.133 --> 06:27.167
"David Brent is refreshingly laid-back for a man with such responsibility."

06:27.234 --> 06:30.133

06:30.200 --> 06:31.667
Yeah. Um...

06:33.334 --> 06:35.200
"Brent mused and then replied..."

-Sorry now, David. -Go on.

-Could you just say what's on your mind? -Yeah.

-And I'm getting it down... -Well, are you getting it down?

06:40.267 --> 06:41.634
Because you're not doing shorthand

06:41.701 --> 06:42.934
and I'm going to be pretty... (SNAPPING FINGERS)

06:44.367 --> 06:45.667
-Just... -Well...

06:45.734 --> 06:48.267
Okay your question, I suppose, was,

06:48.334 --> 06:52.334
"Is it difficult to remain authoritative and yet so popular?"

06:52.400 --> 06:53.934
-Well, no, that wasn't my question. -Well, it's...

06:54.000 --> 06:55.534
Or shall I answer that one first?

06:55.601 --> 06:57.467
Sorry, no. Can we just stick to my questions?

06:57.534 --> 06:59.434
Well, maybe you should be clear on what the question is

06:59.500 --> 07:02.234
because I'm getting a little bit, you know...

07:03.400 --> 07:04.400
Okay.

07:06.133 --> 07:08.434
(LAUGHING)

07:08.500 --> 07:11.300
-But that's what he said on the nog. -That's just offensive.

07:11.367 --> 07:13.500
-What so... What's so funny? -Nothing.

07:15.834 --> 07:16.934
I was just, um...

07:18.033 --> 07:20.167
I was talking to Emma about...

07:37.634 --> 07:39.267
Yep. Okay.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.968

What are the toys? Is it Buckaroo?

08:29.968 --> 08:31.467
So you play the field?

08:31.534 --> 08:34.033
Well, I don't like using chicks and shit,

08:34.100 --> 08:37.367
but I'm just, you know, chilling out while I'm young, I suppose. So...

08:37.434 --> 08:41.701
-And is there a chick in tow at the moment? -Oh, I don't kiss and tell.

-Right, so you don't have a girlfriend. -Well...

08:50.033 --> 08:52.601
What is a "girlfriend"?

08:52.667 --> 08:54.234
Someone that you'd have sex with?

08:54.300 --> 08:57.200
All right, don't get coarse in a magazine for the public.

I don't think you win a Pulitzer for filth.

09:00.801 --> 09:01.968
Right.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.834
(SNIFFLES) You know, I don't give myself a hard time about things particularly.

09:59.901 --> 10:01.267
I'm 30 years young now.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.300
Anyway, I'm not someone who has specific goals

10:04.367 --> 10:07.601
about, you know, having done this or that by my age.

10:07.667 --> 10:09.934
"I should have done this." "Why haven't I taken that chance?"

10:10.000 --> 10:11.834
I used to think...

10:11.901 --> 10:14.834
I don't know, if you look at life like rolling a dice,

10:14.901 --> 10:18.767
then my situation now, as it stands, yeah, it may only be a three.

10:18.834 --> 10:21.601
If I jack that in now, go for something bigger and better,

10:21.667 --> 10:23.467
yeah, I could easily roll a six.

10:23.534 --> 10:27.534
No problem. I could roll a six. I could also roll a one.

10:27.601 --> 10:31.267
Okay. So I think sometimes just leave the dice alone.

10:50.934 --> 10:55.067
That's why my professionalism is probably only as important as...

10:55.267 --> 10:56.667
-(KNOCKING AT DOOR) -Come in.

11:02.667 --> 11:05.968
(SNAPS FINGERS) I've always got time for my staff, Dawn. You know that.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.033
"He's always got time for staff."

11:08.100 --> 11:09.601
Um... Just before you go...

11:09.667 --> 11:11.801
"Even though a lot happening in his mind,

11:11.868 --> 11:14.934
"should be on the staff. He still..." Shoot.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.567
Okay, before you leave, I wanted to hand in my notice.

11:19.801 --> 11:22.033
Oh, no!

11:22.100 --> 11:24.534
I thought this would happen. Who else is thinking of doing this, Dawn?

11:24.601 --> 11:26.534
Um, don't think anyone is.

Don't throw your career away just because I'm leaving.

11:29.033 --> 11:30.734
Yeah, I know it won't be the same.

11:30.801 --> 11:32.567
But you'll probably get to know someone else and...

11:32.634 --> 11:35.000
But that's not why I'm actually going.

11:35.067 --> 11:37.567
-I've read between the lines. -Well, you haven't read it.

11:37.634 --> 11:40.734
Very flattering. But is it just a coincidence

11:40.801 --> 11:42.934
that you're handing in your notice when I'm leaving?

11:43.133 --> 11:44.968
-Yes, it is. -Is it? Is it?

11:45.033 --> 11:46.968
Oh, I thought...

11:47.033 --> 11:48.500
May I ask... Why are you leaving, if you don't mind my asking?

11:48.567 --> 11:50.734
No. I'm gonna go away with my fiance.

11:50.801 --> 11:52.534
-Oh, where are you going? -The States.

11:52.601 --> 11:54.667
All right, okay. Can we just... Yeah, thanks.

11:54.734 --> 11:56.634
What are you going to write about this? Because I thought...

11:56.701 --> 11:58.500
Okay. Cheers. I thought we were...

11:59.734 --> 12:01.300
Getting back to...

12:01.367 --> 12:05.033
"Strings to Brent's bow. A, philanthropist."

12:12.567 --> 12:15.701
-Hiya. Have you got a minute? -Yeah, sure.

12:15.767 --> 12:18.033
I don't know if you know, but when David goes,

12:18.100 --> 12:20.434
-we'll probably gonna do an external appointment. -Right.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.801
But we wondered if you'd do us a favour in the meantime

12:23.868 --> 12:26.667
and be caretaker manager for a while.

12:26.734 --> 12:29.634
-TIM: Oh, blimey. God. -Just...

12:29.701 --> 12:32.334
-Doing David's job for a bit. Overseeing. -Yeah.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.734
And obviously, there'd be acting-up pay.

12:34.801 --> 12:36.467
Right. Well, that's really flattering.

12:36.534 --> 12:38.133
-Thank you. -Not at all.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.601
Listen, I'm gonna say no and...

12:40.667 --> 12:42.834
I mean, it's just a bit more work for a lot more money.

12:42.901 --> 12:46.000
Yep, I understand. I've got nothing to spend it on. So...

12:46.067 --> 12:48.968
-It's only temporary. -I thought that about this job.

12:49.033 --> 12:51.500
And I've been here for, you know... (CHUCKLING)

12:51.567 --> 12:54.334
-Okay. -So I'm, you know...

12:54.400 --> 12:57.200
Listen, I think you should give it to Gareth.

12:57.267 --> 12:58.901
Seriously, I do think you should...

12:58.968 --> 13:01.100
He's a... You know, he's...

13:01.167 --> 13:04.100
-He takes things seriously, he's conscientious... -(TOY WOLF WHISTLES)

13:04.167 --> 13:06.667
-He works hard. -TOY: Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

13:06.734 --> 13:09.067
He's responsible. He knows this place inside out.

13:09.133 --> 13:11.334
You know, genuinely, I think he might be...

13:11.400 --> 13:13.367
-(WILLIAM TELL OVERTURE PLAYING) -...the man for it.

13:13.434 --> 13:15.968
-Great. Thanks, Tim. I'm just gonna go out... -Listen...

13:16.033 --> 13:18.200
Thank you. Much appreciated. Thank you.

13:18.267 --> 13:19.934
TOY: Oh! Oh!

13:20.000 --> 13:21.834
(WAILING) Oh, no!

13:25.500 --> 13:30.033
It says here that for women, the most important qualities in a man are...

13:30.100 --> 13:32.467
Eyes, smile,

13:33.500 --> 13:35.901
-flat stomach... -Yep.

13:35.968 --> 13:37.367
-Buttocks... -Yep.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.968
-You've got good buttocks, Gareth? -Yes.

13:42.167 --> 13:44.567
-Can we see them? -No. Gay.

13:44.634 --> 13:46.133
(CHUCKLES)

13:46.200 --> 13:48.200
Okay. Well, let's put it out.

13:48.267 --> 13:50.000
Sheila, what do you look for in a bloke?

13:56.834 --> 13:58.234
I like blacks.

14:08.734 --> 14:09.968
Cool.

14:11.734 --> 14:12.934
Trudy, what about you?

14:14.234 --> 14:16.133
I quite like shy men, actually.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.834
DAWN: Yeah, I understand that.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.334
Would that be yours as well?

14:20.400 --> 14:22.601
-No. -What do you look for in a man?

14:22.667 --> 14:25.834
Rugged good looks.

14:25.901 --> 14:28.200
You always told me it was a good sense of humour.

14:28.267 --> 14:31.934
Yeah, you've got that. You've got a good sense of humour.

14:32.133 --> 14:33.834
Yeah, I know. I know.

14:47.868 --> 14:49.734
(PHOTOCOPIER WHIRRING)

15:12.734 --> 15:16.133
-Oi, Rach. Have you got a sec? Can I have a word? -Yeah.

15:20.734 --> 15:23.400
I just, uh... I just wanted to tell you

15:23.467 --> 15:25.767
and I don't know...

15:27.367 --> 15:29.400
...how to say it. Um...

15:31.367 --> 15:32.801
Oh, this is so...

15:33.701 --> 15:35.667
(INAUDIBLE)

15:40.934 --> 15:43.133
Well done. She's crying.

15:44.267 --> 15:46.133
I know. Just leave it.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.968
It's always up to me to clear up your mess.

15:48.033 --> 15:50.267
Gareth, okay, I'm begging you. Just stay out of it, mate. Okay?

15:50.334 --> 15:51.767
No. You dumped her.

15:51.834 --> 15:54.334
So it's nothing to do with you any more.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.167
She actually needs someone to cheer her up.

15:56.234 --> 15:57.601
Okay, don't take Dirty Bertie, all right?

15:57.667 --> 16:00.400
Don't go over. I beg you. Don't take Bertie.

16:00.467 --> 16:03.767
-Overruled. -Gareth, if you have to go, don't take Bertie, please.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.534
-Hi, are you... -Fuck off.

16:14.767 --> 16:15.934
Potty-mouth.

16:24.834 --> 16:25.901
Oh...

16:29.200 --> 16:30.601
-There you go. -Oh!

16:30.667 --> 16:33.400
-So stay in touch. -Yeah, cheers.

16:37.968 --> 16:41.434
People can't believe I'm this happy to be leaving,

16:41.500 --> 16:44.234
and it's, you know... It's not because there is anything wrong with it.

16:44.300 --> 16:47.434
It's because... You know I did that thing at the community centre?

16:47.500 --> 16:51.834
Well, as I was giving that motivational speech,

16:51.901 --> 16:57.534
I could literally see them all getting all motivated from it.

16:57.601 --> 16:59.667
And that's... You know, it's like being born again.

16:59.734 --> 17:05.167
And it showed me how much I had to offer other people.

17:06.534 --> 17:09.200
And these are the guys from Cooper & Webb.

17:09.267 --> 17:10.601
They're management training consultants.

17:10.667 --> 17:12.434
I'm dealing with it at the moment.

17:12.500 --> 17:13.901
-This is Ray. This is Jude. -RAY: Hi.

17:14.100 --> 17:15.801
This is Helena.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.267
She's writing quite a big article on me

17:18.334 --> 17:21.300
for Inside Paper, the trade magazine. So...

17:21.367 --> 17:23.934
You know, I've mentioned our thing, so...

17:24.000 --> 17:26.434
You don't mind if she sits in on this gig, do you?

17:26.500 --> 17:29.234
-Oh, no. Not if you don't. -I'm coolio. Okay.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.500

17:39.033 --> 17:41.400
Yup, I'll put you through.

17:41.467 --> 17:45.200
-I'm gonna be in, in a few days. -Okay.

17:45.267 --> 17:48.100
Obviously, if you've got any problems, give me a call at...

17:52.868 --> 17:54.500
-Um, see you later. -Okay.

17:56.567 --> 17:57.801
Bye, Dawn.

18:00.133 --> 18:01.634
-All right, mate? -What?

18:01.701 --> 18:04.934
Probably wondering who they're gonna offer David's job to.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.634
-Me. -Is it... You got it?

18:06.701 --> 18:08.667
-Yes! -Oh, brilliant. Congratulations, mate.

18:08.734 --> 18:10.500
Thank you. Things are gonna start changing around here,

18:10.567 --> 18:12.834
so you can start bucking your ideas up,

18:12.901 --> 18:15.934
starting with your appearance.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.734
It's going to be a well-oiled, tight ship round these here parts.

18:24.067 --> 18:25.267
(EXHALES)

18:25.334 --> 18:27.467
So what sort of management training is it?

18:27.534 --> 18:29.901
-Uh, we specialise... -Well, I'll tell you. It's...

18:29.968 --> 18:34.234
They use celebrity speakers, expert speakers,

18:34.300 --> 18:38.033
and my personal tip is my rise to the top,

18:38.100 --> 18:40.868
which gives it a whole new edge. So...

18:40.934 --> 18:45.467
Okay. So where are we? Shoot.

18:45.534 --> 18:48.334
We'd like to thank you very much for the time you've given us.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.234
No sweat. It's what I do.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.434
-RAY: But we won't be using you again, I'm afraid. -You won't be?

18:53.901 --> 18:55.500
Why not?

18:55.567 --> 18:57.200
RAY: It's just not exactly what we were looking for.

18:57.267 --> 18:59.567
No, I know. But I'll do it how you...

18:59.634 --> 19:01.934
I did it like that because that was the vibe of the day, wasn't it?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
And I'll just... You know. But I'll do it differently.

19:04.067 --> 19:05.434
How do you want me to do it?

19:05.500 --> 19:07.500
We have a very specific idea of what that is

19:07.567 --> 19:09.267
that we're looking for and we know...

19:09.334 --> 19:10.901
Oh, fucking hell!

19:13.934 --> 19:14.934
(SIGHS)

19:17.234 --> 19:19.067
(CLEARS THROAT AWKWARDLY) We would like to say thank you...

21:06.100 --> 21:07.434
Fine. Uh...

21:08.434 --> 21:10.033
Am I fine? Um...

21:11.534 --> 21:14.267
I've just heard you were leaving.

-Blimey! -Say it isn't so.

21:16.767 --> 21:19.133

21:19.767 --> 21:20.767
Yeah. Yeah.

21:22.100 --> 21:23.534
Were you gonna tell me, or...

21:23.601 --> 21:25.901
-God, yeah! -Right. You were?

21:25.968 --> 21:28.100
-Yes! -Okay, okay.

21:28.167 --> 21:30.934
So are you... You getting another job?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.300
-No. Um... -All right.

21:32.367 --> 21:34.500
Lee and I are going to go away.

21:34.567 --> 21:37.968
-On holiday? -No, no. We're going to Florida.

21:38.033 --> 21:42.567
Um, for about six months, something like that.

-and, you know, so we could live with her. -Hmm.

21:49.701 --> 21:52.634
And he's not happy in his job. I'm not happy in mine.

21:52.701 --> 21:55.133

21:57.300 --> 22:00.934
-Starting again? -Right. Starting again.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.067
Yeah. We'll just get our heads together, I think, and... You know.

-Yeah. Yeah. My sister's over there. Yeah. -TIM: Brilliant.

22:18.334 --> 22:20.067
Got a big house, haven't they?

22:20.133 --> 22:21.901
-We haven't seen it yet. -We've seen pictures of the house.

22:21.968 --> 22:26.200
It's a big place. Her husband's raking it in as well. Yeah.

22:26.267 --> 22:28.767
Yeah, we thought we'd get one of those mobile homes, you know,

22:28.834 --> 22:31.901
drive up the coast to the beaches until the cash runs out.

22:31.968 --> 22:34.934
Then, I suppose come home, or better still get a place out there.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.367
-If we like. -Mmm.

22:36.434 --> 22:37.968
-LEE: Accommodation's well cheap. -Is it?

22:38.033 --> 22:39.467
Yeah. I mean, if Dawn gets a job on reception out there,

22:39.534 --> 22:42.334
she'll be twice as well off. So makes sense.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.701
Oh, fancy that. That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

22:44.767 --> 22:46.434

DAWN: A real relationship isn't like a fairy tale.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.067
If you think that for the next 40 years

23:01.133 --> 23:02.968
every time you see each other you're going to glow,

23:03.033 --> 23:05.567
or you know, every time you hold hands there's gonna be electricity,

23:05.634 --> 23:08.767
then you're kidding yourself really, you know.

23:08.834 --> 23:12.500
What about reliability, or someone paying the mortgage

23:12.567 --> 23:15.701
or someone who's never been out of work?

23:15.767 --> 23:18.701
Those are the more important practical things, you know.

24:06.100 --> 24:09.767
I didn't ask her out, I asked her out as a friend.

24:09.834 --> 24:12.300
I asked her out because she was having trouble with Lee at the time.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.267
And there was no... It wasn't like a...

24:14.334 --> 24:15.901
You know, under different circumstances,

24:16.100 --> 24:18.400
I'm sure something may have happened but...

24:18.467 --> 24:22.534
You know? She's going away now.

24:22.601 --> 24:25.834
You know, you can't act... You can't change circumstances.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.100
You know.

24:31.767 --> 24:33.267
Sorry. Excuse me.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.767
Dawn. Dawn, can I just have a word in there?

24:53.033 --> 24:54.801
Ta.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.400
-Let me just remove... -(MICROPHONE RUSTLING)

24:59.167 --> 25:00.567
(MICROPHONE GOES OFF)

25:00.634 --> 25:02.500
(INAUDIBLE)

25:38.868 --> 25:40.500
(SWITCHES MICROPHONE ON)

25:40.567 --> 25:42.133
She said, "No," by the way.

25:48.934 --> 25:51.267
-You all right, David? -Yep, fine. You?

25:51.334 --> 25:53.767
-MAN: Yup. -Good. Small talk done.

25:53.834 --> 25:56.601
-Okay, thanks very much. Um... -Go on.

25:56.667 --> 25:59.167
Everyone really appreciates what you've done.

26:00.467 --> 26:01.634
Do you?

26:03.400 --> 26:06.534
Okay. Down to business.

26:06.601 --> 26:09.634
That's what we've come up with as a redundancy offer.

26:13.100 --> 26:15.734
Yup. More than I expected.

26:15.801 --> 26:18.500
-MAN: We've been quite generous. -Bada bing.

26:20.133 --> 26:23.467
Now, you can leave on the third with your holiday,

26:23.534 --> 26:25.968
I understand, which is a Tuesday.

26:26.033 --> 26:28.567
Now we wondered if you wanted to come back for a party on the Friday

26:28.634 --> 26:30.968
-or leave on the Friday before? -(WHISTLING)

26:31.767 --> 26:33.200
Whatever.

26:33.267 --> 26:36.467
MAN: Okay. Well, again, thanks very much, David.

26:37.400 --> 26:38.834
Don't make me redundant.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.334
-I... -Please.

26:45.634 --> 26:47.100
Look, David...

26:47.167 --> 26:49.033
I don't... I've changed my mind. I don't want redundancy.

26:49.100 --> 26:51.801
I don't want that. I haven't signed anything. So...

26:51.868 --> 26:53.500
MAN: Well...

26:53.567 --> 26:55.100
David, unfortunately, it's not really up to you.

26:55.167 --> 26:56.267
-No, okay then. -MAN: I'm sorry.

26:56.334 --> 26:58.534
All right, then. Well, I'm asking.

26:58.601 --> 27:00.834
Okay? Please don't make me redundant.

27:05.734 --> 27:08.167
You can talk to someone, Jenny.

27:08.234 --> 27:11.133
-JENNIFER: But the wheels are already in motion. -I know. We'll stop them.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.534
Because...

27:12.601 --> 27:14.634
MAN: David, we're not going to discuss this now.

27:14.701 --> 27:19.367
I know, but just say that it's not definite now, before you go. We can...

27:22.567 --> 27:26.200
I will try twice as hard, I really will. I know I've been complacent.

27:26.267 --> 27:27.868
And I will turn this place around,

27:27.934 --> 27:31.868
if we just say that it's not definite now, and then we can...

27:31.934 --> 27:35.067
And you're not going until... Starting from now.

27:35.801 --> 27:37.133
Starting from now.

27:53.567 --> 27:57.033
DAVID: Life is just a series of peaks and troughs.

27:57.100 --> 28:00.901
Yeah. And you don't know whether you're in a trough

28:00.968 --> 28:02.500
until you're climbing out,

28:02.567 --> 28:05.734
or on a peak until you're coming down.

28:05.801 --> 28:09.100
And that's it. You never know what's around the corner.

28:09.167 --> 28:12.567
But it's all good. Um... Yeah.

28:12.634 --> 28:17.300
If you want the rainbow, you've got to put up with the rain.

28:17.367 --> 28:19.534
Do you know which "philosopher" said that?

28:19.601 --> 28:20.767
Dolly Parton.

28:20.834 --> 28:22.634
Yeah.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.234
And people say she's just a big pair of tits.

28:32.467 --> 28:35.701
# So what becomes of you, my love

28:38.000 --> 28:42.467
# When they have finally stripped you of

28:42.534 --> 28:45.100
# The handbags and the gladrags

28:45.167 --> 28:49.400
# That your granddad had to sweat so you could buy #

28:51.267 --> 28:52.801
(PHONE RINGING)

28:54.234 --> 28:55.834
Hello, Wernham Hogg.
