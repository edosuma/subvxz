Bravo, Martin.

01:50.690 --> 01:52.130
Oh please,
call me Papa.

01:52.190 --> 01:54.760
A little ketchup
for your buns, Papa?

01:54.830 --> 01:57.270
I think we have time
for one more report.

01:57.330 --> 01:59.030
- Bart Simpson?
- Oh!!

01:59.100 --> 02:01.570
Is your book report on
<i>Treasure Island ready?</i>

02:01.630 --> 02:02.890
Is it ready?

02:02.970 --> 02:04.640
Ha! What a question.

02:04.700 --> 02:07.330
Fellow students,
prepare to be dazzled.

02:07.410 --> 02:10.180
Well, as Mrs. Krabappel
already mentioned

02:10.240 --> 02:13.400
the name of the book that
I read was <i>Treasure Island.</i>

02:13.480 --> 02:15.680
It's about these... pirates.

02:15.750 --> 02:19.020
Pirates with patches
over their eyes...

02:19.080 --> 02:20.710
and shiny gold teeth...

02:20.790 --> 02:23.420
and green birds
on their shoulders.

02:25.090 --> 02:26.660
Did I mention this book

02:26.730 --> 02:29.660
was written by a guy
named Robert Louis Stevenson?

02:29.730 --> 02:32.530
And published by the good people
at McGraw-Hill.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.800
So, in conclusion

02:33.870 --> 02:36.270
on the Simpson scale
of one to ten

02:36.340 --> 02:39.140
ten being the highest,
one being the lowest

02:39.200 --> 02:42.900
and five being average,
I give this book a nine.

02:42.980 --> 02:44.580
Ahem. Any questions?

02:44.640 --> 02:46.640
No? Then I'll just sit down.

02:46.710 --> 02:48.520
Bart, did you read the book?

02:48.580 --> 02:49.950
Mrs. Krabappel,
I am insulted.

02:50.020 --> 02:52.850
Is this a book report
or a witch hunt?

02:52.920 --> 02:55.290
Then perhaps you'd
like to tell us

02:55.350 --> 02:57.280
the <i>name of the pirate.</i>

02:57.360 --> 03:00.860
Bart:
<i>Blackbeard, Captain Nemo,
Captain Hook, Long John...</i>

03:00.930 --> 03:01.860
Bluebeard?

03:01.930 --> 03:03.300
Sit down, Bart.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.970
- I'll see you after class.
- Awww.

03:06.030 --> 03:07.400
Your grades have gotten
steadily worse

03:07.470 --> 03:08.940
since the beginning of the term.

03:09.000 --> 03:09.840
Are you aware of that?

03:09.900 --> 03:11.410
Yes, ma'am.

03:11.470 --> 03:12.940
Are you aware that there is a
<i>major exam tomorrow</i>

03:13.010 --> 03:14.040
on colonial America?

03:14.110 --> 03:14.880
Yes, ma'am.

03:21.180 --> 03:22.650
Bart, you haven't

03:22.710 --> 03:24.210
been paying attention
to a word I've said, have you?!

03:24.280 --> 03:25.240
Yes, ma'am.

03:25.320 --> 03:26.620
Well then, what did I say?

03:26.690 --> 03:28.860
Uh... straighten up
and fly right?

03:28.920 --> 03:30.490
That was a lucky guess.

03:33.530 --> 03:35.630
Hyuh! Take that, granny!

03:46.410 --> 03:48.780

03:48.840 --> 03:49.810

03:49.880 --> 03:51.680

04:08.960 --> 04:11.500
Hurry up, or it will get
that icky skin on the top.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.520
Ew, I hate that icky soup skin.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.600
Okay, right after dinner,
it's down to business.

04:16.670 --> 04:18.839
Marge, could you get me
another beer, please?

04:18.899 --> 04:20.000
In a second, Homer.

04:20.070 --> 04:21.579
Lisa has some good news.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.080
He doesn't care, Mom.

04:23.140 --> 04:26.210
Sure I do.
I just want to have a beer
while I'm caring.

04:26.280 --> 04:27.050
Marge?

04:27.110 --> 04:27.710
Homer!

04:28.480 --> 04:29.680
Go ahead, Lisa.

04:29.750 --> 04:32.820
Okay. I got an "A"
on my vocabulary test.

04:32.890 --> 04:34.190
What!?

04:34.250 --> 04:35.610
You did?

04:35.690 --> 04:37.190
Well, that's just...

04:37.260 --> 04:39.360
Oh, what a glorious day!

04:39.420 --> 04:40.690
<i>Lisa, hand me your paper.</i>

04:40.760 --> 04:42.000
I'm just gonna take this

04:42.060 --> 04:43.700
over to the refrigerator and...

04:43.760 --> 04:45.860
Hmm.. well, as long as I'm here

04:45.930 --> 04:48.200
<i>I might as well kill two birds
with one stone.</i>

04:48.270 --> 04:50.070
What's the big idea?
You covered up my paper.

04:50.140 --> 04:52.070
Heh-heh, look at those funny
little whiskers.

04:52.140 --> 04:53.410
That reminds me

04:53.470 --> 04:55.780
it's Big Gorilla Week
on <i>Million Dollar Movie.</i>

04:55.840 --> 04:56.840
Come on, boy.

04:56.910 --> 04:59.250
No, Dad. I should really...
hyuhh!

04:59.310 --> 05:02.250
Ooh, <i>Gorilla the Conqueror--</i>

maybe just one more hour.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.790
( <i>Homer crying )</i>

05:12.860 --> 05:14.300
It's so unfair.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.560
Just because he's different.

05:16.630 --> 05:18.730
Well, time
to hit the books.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.200
Burning the candle
at both ends, eh boy?

05:21.270 --> 05:22.600
Go get 'em.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.140
All right, okay.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.630
Let's take care
of some business.

Uh-oh.

Hey, Bart dude!

06:05.880 --> 06:07.450
Ooh, you look freaked.

06:07.510 --> 06:09.770
Otto man, I've got a big test
I am not ready for.

06:09.850 --> 06:11.620
Could you please
crash the bus, or something?

06:11.680 --> 06:14.410
Oh, sorry, little buddy.
Can't do it on purpose

06:14.490 --> 06:16.220
but hey, maybe
you'll get lucky.

06:16.290 --> 06:17.760
Okay, no reason to panic.

06:17.820 --> 06:20.790
Find an egghead,
pump him for some answers

06:20.860 --> 06:22.560
and boom! I'm back
on easy street.

06:24.430 --> 06:25.670
Oh-ho.

06:25.730 --> 06:27.200
Look at him.

06:27.270 --> 06:28.740
I bet he didn't study again.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.670
And now he's gonna try to
kiss up and get answers from us.

06:31.740 --> 06:33.370
He's pathetic.

06:33.440 --> 06:34.810
Good morning, girls.

Good morning, Bart.

Say, who's up
for a little cram session?

06:38.840 --> 06:40.340
I'll go first.

06:40.410 --> 06:43.080
What was the name
of the pilgrims' boat?

06:43.150 --> 06:44.920
The <i>Spirit
of St. Louis.</i>

06:44.980 --> 06:46.380
Where did they land?

06:46.450 --> 06:47.860
Sunny Acapulco.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.620
Why did they
leave England?

06:49.690 --> 06:51.030
Giant rats.

Cool! History's

06:57.000 --> 06:58.500
As a natural enemy

06:58.560 --> 07:00.290
I don't know
why I should care

07:00.370 --> 07:01.970
but the information
pertaining

07:02.030 --> 07:04.260
to America's colonial period
that you've just received

07:04.340 --> 07:05.640
is erroneous.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.030
So you're saying...

07:07.110 --> 07:09.180
A blindfolded chimp with
a pencil in his teeth

07:09.240 --> 07:11.010
has a better chance
of passing this test

07:11.080 --> 07:12.680
than you do.

07:12.740 --> 07:14.270
( school bell rings )
Thanks for the pep talk.

07:15.650 --> 07:18.590
Alright students, take one
and pass the rest back.

Short, stabbing pains
in my stomach.

07:48.450 --> 07:49.450
Oh, dear.

07:49.510 --> 07:50.840
I've heard of this.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.790
Do you feel a shooting pain
in your arm?

07:53.850 --> 07:54.790
Both arms, ma'am.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.610
Temporary loss of vision?

07:56.690 --> 07:58.160
Who said that?

Come closer.

08:02.030 --> 08:02.960
Yes, dear?

08:03.030 --> 08:04.000
Ahh.

08:04.060 --> 08:05.520
Maybe one more dish.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.600
Make it double cappuccino
chocolate fudge.

08:08.670 --> 08:10.270
Oh, your third bowl.

08:10.340 --> 08:12.040
I think you may be
on the mend.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.630
Is there anything else
I can get you?

08:13.710 --> 08:15.140
Hmm...

08:15.210 --> 08:16.680
Perhaps the TV?

08:16.740 --> 08:18.480
Of course. Homer!

08:18.540 --> 08:19.540
What?

Everyone knows
you're faking it, Bart.

08:29.790 --> 08:32.059
Well everyone better
keep their mouth shut.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.520
You're gonna have to fail
that history test

08:33.590 --> 08:34.360
sooner or later.

08:34.429 --> 08:37.200
I've got my bases covered.

08:37.260 --> 08:39.720
Hey Milhouse, what'd I miss
in school today?

08:39.799 --> 08:42.440
Nothin' much.
Lewis made Richard laugh milk
through his nose.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.799
You don't say.

08:43.870 --> 08:45.140
What about that history test?

08:45.200 --> 08:46.530
Piece of cake, huh?

08:46.610 --> 08:49.310
Listen, what did you get
for number one?

08:49.370 --> 08:50.300
Uh-huh.

08:50.380 --> 08:51.310
Number two?

08:51.380 --> 08:53.350
Oh, yeah, that sounds right.

08:53.410 --> 08:55.120
Mm, mm-mm, mm, mm, <i>mmm.</i>

08:55.180 --> 08:56.250
Ahh!

08:56.310 --> 08:58.180
Here you go,
Mrs. Krabappel.

08:58.250 --> 09:00.720
I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.420
Mm-hmm.

09:02.490 --> 09:03.660
Yep.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.060
Mm-hmm.

09:05.120 --> 09:08.120
This test is worse
than Milhouse's exam.

09:08.190 --> 09:10.150
Bart Simpson, I warned you.

09:10.230 --> 09:12.270
This is the final straw.

09:12.330 --> 09:15.540
Mr. And Mrs. Simpson,
I think you know our
district psychiatrist

09:15.600 --> 09:17.000
Dr. J. Loren Pryor.

09:17.070 --> 09:17.770
Hey, Doctor J.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.310
Hmph.

09:19.370 --> 09:21.440
I think what we have on our
hands here is a classic case

09:21.510 --> 09:25.910
<i>of what laymen refer to as
"fear of failure."</i>

09:25.980 --> 09:29.720
As a result,
Bart is an underachiever,
and yet he seems to be...

09:29.780 --> 09:31.790
how should I put this...

09:31.850 --> 09:33.050
proud of it.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.460
Hmm.

09:34.520 --> 09:35.920
One of his problems may
be his short attention span

09:35.990 --> 09:37.860
which can lead to...

09:37.920 --> 09:38.920
<i>blah
blah

09:38.990 --> 09:39.860
<i>blah

09:39.930 --> 09:40.800
Uh-huh.

09:40.860 --> 09:42.330
<i>Blah

09:42.390 --> 09:43.450
<i>blah

09:43.530 --> 09:44.230
Hmm...

09:44.300 --> 09:45.500
Bart has failed

09:45.560 --> 09:47.330
his last four exams in History.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.600
Is there anything

09:48.670 --> 09:49.500
you're
not telling us?

09:49.570 --> 09:50.770
No.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.610
Every other student
in the class has shown

09:52.670 --> 09:54.310
at least some form
of improvement

09:54.370 --> 09:55.730
and yet <i>you
continue to struggle.</i>

09:55.810 --> 09:56.880
Why is that?

09:56.940 --> 09:57.880
I don't know.

09:57.940 --> 09:59.240
Look at these results--

09:59.310 --> 10:00.380
<i>Fifty-five...</i>

10:00.450 --> 10:01.550
<i>Forty-two...</i>

10:01.610 --> 10:02.670
Twenty-six...

10:02.750 --> 10:04.450
<i>A 12
on state capitals?</i>

10:04.520 --> 10:07.560
Okay! Okay.
Why are we dancing
around the obvious?

10:07.620 --> 10:10.220
I know it. You know it.
I am dumb, okay?
Dumb as a post!

10:10.290 --> 10:11.760
You think I'm
happy about it?

10:11.820 --> 10:14.220
Bart, you're just
a late bloomer.

10:14.290 --> 10:15.590
Oh, I wish it were
that simple.

10:15.660 --> 10:18.000
As shameful
and as emotionally crippling

10:18.060 --> 10:19.660
as it may be

10:19.730 --> 10:22.840
I'm afraid my recommendation
is for Bart Simpson to repeat

10:22.900 --> 10:24.040
the fourth grade.

10:24.100 --> 10:25.360
What? You can't hold me back.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.070
I'll do better. I promise.

10:27.140 --> 10:28.410
Promises,
promises.
Oh, sure. That'll be the day.

10:28.470 --> 10:30.570
Well, maybe it
<i>would help him</i>

10:30.640 --> 10:32.010
to be left back.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.950
It won't be
so bad, Bart.

10:34.010 --> 10:35.280
No, I mean it.

10:35.350 --> 10:36.250
<i>You can't hold me back.</i>

10:36.310 --> 10:37.310
I swear I'm gonna do better.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.280
Look at my eyes--
see the sincerity?

10:39.350 --> 10:41.390
See the conviction?
See the fear?

10:41.450 --> 10:45.250
As God is my witness,
I can pass the fourth grade!

10:45.320 --> 10:47.220
And if you don't,
at least

10:47.290 --> 10:49.760
you'll be bigger
than the other kids.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.500
s,

10:51.560 --> 10:53.060
or forever hold your peace,
little dudes.

10:54.430 --> 10:56.360
Otto, you know
I respect you.

10:56.430 --> 10:59.000
I mean, you always
let us throw stuff at cars

10:59.070 --> 11:00.640
and try to tip the bus
on sharp turns.

11:00.710 --> 11:03.840
Damn thing never goes over,
does it?

11:03.910 --> 11:05.810
So what's in your head,
little man?

11:05.880 --> 11:08.220
Well, I been failing
a lot of tests recently.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.150
Yuh-huh?

11:09.210 --> 11:10.570
And now they're talking about

11:10.650 --> 11:13.850
holding me back in the 4th grade
if I don't shape up.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.090
That's it?

11:15.150 --> 11:16.750
Hey, relax, man.

11:16.820 --> 11:18.890
It could end up being
the best thing that ever
happened to you.

11:18.960 --> 11:23.060
I got held back
in the fourth grade myself.
Twice.

11:23.130 --> 11:24.770
And look at me, man.

11:24.830 --> 11:26.770
Now I <i>drive the school bus.</i>

11:30.840 --> 11:32.670
Dr. Pryor:
<i>I'm afraid my recommendation
is for Bart Simpson</i>

11:32.740 --> 11:34.980
<i>to repeat the fourth grade...</i>

11:35.040 --> 11:35.940
<i>repeat the fourth grade...</i>

11:36.010 --> 11:37.850
<i>repeat the fourth grade...</i>

11:37.910 --> 11:39.180
All right, class.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.270
The topic is world literature.

11:41.350 --> 11:45.620
What was the pirate's name
in <i>Treasure Island?</i>

11:45.680 --> 11:47.550
Bart Simpson?

11:47.620 --> 11:50.390
Look lady, I got a peptic ulcer

11:50.460 --> 11:54.090
a wife hawking me for a new car,
and I need a root canal.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.760
Will you quit bugging me
about this stupid pirate?

11:56.830 --> 11:58.270
Psst.
It's Long John Silver, Dad.

11:58.330 --> 12:00.230
I heard that, Bart, Jr.

12:00.300 --> 12:03.100
I want to see both of you
after class today.

12:03.170 --> 12:04.610
D-ohh!

12:04.670 --> 12:06.710
Thanks a lot, son.

12:06.770 --> 12:08.640
( <i>infield chatter )</i>

12:10.980 --> 12:12.650
Yo, little help.

12:12.710 --> 12:14.550
I said, "little help."

12:14.610 --> 12:16.570
Throw me the ball,
Poindexter!

12:16.650 --> 12:17.950
Oh, I'm sorry, Bart.

12:18.020 --> 12:20.620
I'm unfamiliar with the rules
of your sport.

12:20.690 --> 12:23.590
I didn't want to interfere
with a ball in play.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.330
( <i>laughing )</i>

12:26.390 --> 12:29.600
Well, back to the forecastle
of the <i>Pequod.</i>

12:29.660 --> 12:31.230
Hmm... hey, Martin?

12:31.300 --> 12:32.630
You have your ball.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.470
I have nothing else
of value.

12:34.530 --> 12:36.690
I need you to help
me get a passing grade.

12:36.770 --> 12:40.140
Well, you <i>do need someone's help
to get a passing grade</i>

12:40.210 --> 12:42.880
but I don't know why
that someone should be me.

12:42.940 --> 12:44.510
Because I can make it
so the other kids

12:44.580 --> 12:46.310
don't laugh at you so much.

12:46.380 --> 12:49.020
They... laugh at me?

12:49.080 --> 12:52.650
I'd always considered myself
rather popular.

12:52.720 --> 12:53.720
You're not.

12:53.790 --> 12:55.320
Watch.
Oof!

12:55.390 --> 12:56.190
( <i>laughing )</i>

12:57.820 --> 13:00.990
But my speed with numbers

13:01.060 --> 13:03.660
my years of service
as a hall monitor

13:03.730 --> 13:05.670
my prizewinning
dioramas--

13:05.730 --> 13:08.170
these things
mean nothing to them?

13:08.230 --> 13:10.330
Perhaps another
demonstration.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.940
( <i>kids laughing )</i>

13:12.000 --> 13:13.060
Very well.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.610
You have made your point,
Bart.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.100
Then it's a deal?

13:16.170 --> 13:17.670
Yes.

13:17.740 --> 13:20.740
Alrighty, let's have a look-see
at your study area.

13:20.810 --> 13:21.750
Study area?

13:21.810 --> 13:23.140
Yes, your sanctuary

13:23.210 --> 13:25.340
from the hurly-burly
of modern life.

13:25.420 --> 13:27.820
Well, there's a desk
under that junk over there.

13:27.890 --> 13:31.830
Martin:
Oh, no no no, no.
This won't do at all.

13:31.890 --> 13:33.230
We're gonna have to
clean up this room

13:33.290 --> 13:35.030
and we'll clearly need
a few ferns in here.

13:35.090 --> 13:38.560
No study area is complete
without adequate plant life.

13:40.130 --> 13:41.370
No.

13:41.430 --> 13:42.760
No?

13:42.830 --> 13:45.100
Only geeks
sit in the front seat.

13:45.170 --> 13:46.570
From now on,
sit in the back row.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.780
And that's not just on the bus.

13:47.840 --> 13:48.740
<i>It goes for school
and church, too.</i>

13:48.810 --> 13:49.840
Why?

13:49.910 --> 13:52.810
So no one can see
what you're doing.

13:52.880 --> 13:56.650
Oh! I think I understand.
The potential for mischief
varies inversely

13:56.710 --> 13:59.940
with one's proximity
to the authority figure.

14:00.020 --> 14:02.720
Well, yeah, but don't
say it like that.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.530

Aaah!
Aaah!

14:39.490 --> 14:40.960
Hyuhh!

14:41.030 --> 14:44.730
Pretty soon you will be ready
to try it with a real book.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.700
( <i>laughing )</i>

14:47.770 --> 14:49.300
Who would have thought

14:49.370 --> 14:51.740
pushing a boy into
the girls' lavatory

14:51.800 --> 14:53.460
could be such a thrill?

14:53.540 --> 14:56.980
The screams, the humiliation,
the fact that it wasn't me!

14:57.040 --> 14:58.910
I've never felt so <i>alive.</i>

14:58.980 --> 15:00.150
Great, Martin.

15:00.210 --> 15:02.050
Now the big test
is tomorrow...

15:02.110 --> 15:03.910
Who cares about some test?

15:03.980 --> 15:05.850
Life's too short for tests!

15:05.920 --> 15:07.450
Hey, I thought
we had a deal!

15:07.520 --> 15:09.160
Ha, ha, ha!

15:09.220 --> 15:10.960
The Martin Prince
you made a deal with

15:11.020 --> 15:13.220
no longer exists!

15:13.290 --> 15:14.560
Come on fellows, to the arcade!

15:14.630 --> 15:15.900
Cool, Martin!

15:15.960 --> 15:17.460
All right, Martin!

15:24.970 --> 15:26.210
Bart?

15:26.270 --> 15:28.180
It's past your bedtime.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.180
Okay.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.180
This is hopeless.

15:32.240 --> 15:36.270
Ohh...

15:36.350 --> 15:39.120
Well, old-timer,
I guess this is
the end of the road.

15:39.180 --> 15:41.450
I know I haven't always
been a good kid

15:41.520 --> 15:44.530
but if I have to go
to school tomorrow

15:44.590 --> 15:46.090
I'll fail the test
and be held back.

15:46.160 --> 15:49.060
I just need one more day
to study, Lord.

15:49.130 --> 15:50.400
I <i>need your help.</i>

15:50.460 --> 15:53.070
Prayer, the last refuge
of a scoundrel.

15:53.130 --> 15:56.400
A teacher's strike,
a power failure, a blizzard--

15:56.470 --> 15:58.940
anything that will
cancel school tomorrow.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.030
I know it's asking a lot

16:01.110 --> 16:04.010
but if anyone can do it,
you can.

16:04.080 --> 16:07.680
Thanking you in advance,
your pal, Bart Simpson.

Class is over.

Do you think you could

Well, all right.

Let me get "old red."

Mm-hmm.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.380
Yup.

20:22.450 --> 20:23.390
Mm-hmm.

20:23.450 --> 20:24.390
Mm-hmm.

20:24.450 --> 20:26.490
Well, Bart, it's a 59.

20:26.550 --> 20:27.910
That's another "F."

20:27.990 --> 20:29.130
Oh, no.

20:29.190 --> 20:30.690
I can't believe it.

20:30.760 --> 20:31.860
I know, I know.

20:31.930 --> 20:33.260
Another year together.

Oh! It's going

20:41.270 --> 20:42.710
What's the matter?

20:42.770 --> 20:45.610
I'd think you'd be
used to failing by now.

20:45.670 --> 20:47.600
No, you don't understand.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.850
I really tried this time.

20:49.910 --> 20:51.480
I mean, I <i>really tried.</i>

20:51.550 --> 20:52.880
There, there.

20:52.950 --> 20:56.720
This is as good as I can do
and I still failed.

20:56.780 --> 20:59.810
Well, a 59-- it's a <i>high "F."</i>

20:59.890 --> 21:01.490
Who am I kidding?

21:01.560 --> 21:03.490
I really am a failure.

21:03.560 --> 21:04.660
Now I know

21:04.730 --> 21:06.660
how George Washington felt

21:06.730 --> 21:08.830
when he surrendered
Fort Necessity

21:08.900 --> 21:10.630
to the French
in 1754.

21:10.700 --> 21:11.970
What?

21:12.030 --> 21:15.430
Oh you know, 1754-- the famous
defeat to the French.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.930
My God, Bart, you're right.

21:18.010 --> 21:18.710
So?

21:18.770 --> 21:19.430
You just demonstrated

21:19.510 --> 21:21.080
applied knowledge

21:21.140 --> 21:22.250
and due to
the difficulty

21:22.310 --> 21:24.210
and relative obscurity
of the reference

21:24.280 --> 21:28.120
you deserve
an extra point on your exam.
Hey, it's only fair.

21:28.180 --> 21:29.910
You mean, I passed?

21:29.980 --> 21:30.910
Just barely.
