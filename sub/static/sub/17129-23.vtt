21:11.270 --> 21:12.739
IS GOING TO BE STAYING
WITH US,

21:12.739 --> 21:14.774
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN
TALK TO ME ABOUT IT?

21:14.774 --> 21:17.444
WHY DO YOU GOT TO SAY IT
LIKE THAT, ALL NEGATIVE?

21:19.546 --> 21:21.381
THAT'S WHY THE KIDS
COME TO ME,

21:21.381 --> 21:28.955
BECAUSE I LOVE THEM
UNCONDITIONAL.
