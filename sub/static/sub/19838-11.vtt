<b>Today is the tenth day.</b>

00:05.570 --> 00:09.730
<b>If they don't return, their data will be erased.</b>

00:10.230 --> 00:13.680
<b>Well, I guess we have to wait 
for Goreinu to contact us.</b>

00:15.740 --> 00:17.120
<b>Yes! I got it!</b>

00:17.490 --> 00:19.740
<b>Look, I've got this down pat.</b>

00:19.740 --> 00:22.370
<b>Can I concentrate on Emitter training now?</b>

00:22.370 --> 00:23.450
<b>No!</b>

00:23.450 --> 00:27.250
<b>You might have it down, but you're 
still off by a tenth of a second.</b>

00:27.250 --> 00:29.940
<b>Your goal is to be within a hundredth of a second.</b>

00:29.940 --> 00:31.030
<b>Now start!</b>

00:31.030 --> 00:32.380
<b>Man...</b>

00:35.190 --> 00:39.140
<b>Another player has used Contact to reach you.</b>

02:01.010 --> 02:06.060
<b>Insanity x And x Sanity</b>

02:06.810 --> 02:07.920
<b>It's Goreinu.</b>

02:07.920 --> 02:09.250
<b>Sorry to keep you waiting.</b>

02:09.250 --> 02:10.290
<b>What's going on?</b>

02:11.140 --> 02:13.060
<b>Do you realize it'll soon have been 240 hours</b>

02:13.060 --> 02:15.450
<b>since Tsezgerra's team exited the game?</b>

02:15.450 --> 02:16.070
<b>Yeah.</b>

02:16.760 --> 02:19.700
<b>I can tell you now they won't be returning.</b>

02:19.700 --> 02:20.810
<b>Why not?</b>

02:21.250 --> 02:24.080
<b>Genthru's team is camping the starting point.</b>

02:24.920 --> 02:29.790
<b>We decided beforehand that they 
wouldn't return to the game</b>

02:29.790 --> 02:32.330
<b>until I sent an all clear signal.</b>

02:32.330 --> 02:33.750
<b>I understand.</b>

02:33.750 --> 02:36.390
<b>But their card data will disappear.</b>

02:36.390 --> 02:39.200
<b>I'm holding on to all the valuable cards.</b>

02:39.200 --> 02:41.840
<b>Doesn't that betray that they have other allies?</b>

02:41.840 --> 02:44.900
<b>They'll notice if none of the four 
have any important cards!</b>

02:48.910 --> 02:53.450
<b>They left the game at 3:05, ten days ago, right?</b>

02:53.450 --> 02:57.440
<b>Yeah, in five more minutes, 
their card data will be wiped.</b>

02:57.440 --> 02:59.240
<b>Essentially, they'll be out of it.</b>

02:59.590 --> 03:01.990
<b>To be safe, we'll wait until 3:10.</b>

03:02.870 --> 03:06.450
<b>But do you really think they've given up?</b>

03:06.450 --> 03:07.790
<b>Absolutely.</b>

03:08.090 --> 03:10.620
<b>Given that they took Battera and ran.</b>

03:10.940 --> 03:14.870
<b>It was a desperate attempt to 
keep us from the reward.</b>

03:15.370 --> 03:19.580
<b>But they spent years collecting 
those ninety-six cards.</b>

03:19.580 --> 03:23.730
<b>Also, I'm wondering why Battera 
would send his guards packing.</b>

03:24.260 --> 03:26.760
<b>No idea... Guess something happened.</b>

03:27.040 --> 03:30.030
<b>No point in speculating about it now.</b>

03:30.320 --> 03:32.770
<b>Oh, it's 3:10.</b>

03:33.570 --> 03:34.540
<b>Time's up.</b>

03:35.060 --> 03:36.250
<b>Yay!</b>

03:36.250 --> 03:38.410
<b>Bye-bye, Tsezgerra!</b>

03:39.210 --> 03:40.030
<b>Fake?</b>

03:40.330 --> 03:41.390
<b>Yeah,</b>

03:41.390 --> 03:47.410
<b>we switched about thirty of their 
ninety-six cards with fakes.</b>

03:48.440 --> 03:51.470
<b>I'm the one actually holding 
the ninety-six cards.</b>

03:51.840 --> 03:55.170
<b>For such a cautious man, this is the 
biggest gamble of Tsezgerra's life.</b>

03:55.870 --> 03:58.300
<b>So I want to make sure it pays off.</b>

03:58.650 --> 04:03.100
<b>I'm sorry, but I won't be able to 
help you face Genthru's crew.</b>

04:03.100 --> 04:04.290
<b>Understood.</b>

04:04.290 --> 04:06.660
<b>When do you want us to give you the card?</b>

04:07.370 --> 04:10.270
<b>I'll wait until you've defeated Genthru.</b>

04:10.270 --> 04:11.190

<b>Now it's time to go after those kids.</b>

04:16.650 --> 04:21.320
<b>It wasn't in the plan, but we can 
get Patch of Shore from them.</b>

04:21.640 --> 04:24.160
<b>First, we need more copies of Accompany.</b>

04:24.160 --> 04:25.320
<b>Okay.</b>

04:26.340 --> 04:27.870
<b>They're on the move.</b>

04:28.320 --> 04:30.100
<b>Where are you right now?</b>

04:30.100 --> 04:31.650
<b>Near Soufrabi.</b>

04:32.090 --> 04:34.170
<b>They're heading toward Masadora.</b>

04:34.470 --> 04:37.330
<b>Once they're prepared, they'll come for you.</b>

04:37.670 --> 04:38.770

04:39.070 --> 04:40.270
<b>Absolutely.</b>

<b><i>We need more time.</i></b>

04:44.650 --> 04:48.180
<b><i>But we have no choice. It'll depend on Gon.</i></b>

04:48.720 --> 04:49.460
<b>Gon!</b>

04:49.800 --> 04:53.680
<b>Did you let our conversation 
distract you and lose track?</b>

04:59.850 --> 05:02.230
<b>Please explain what this is about.</b>

05:02.880 --> 05:04.990
<b>I realize that I was being intrusive,</b>

05:04.990 --> 05:07.510
<b>but I took a look.</b>

05:09.520 --> 05:10.910
<b>Your daughter?</b>

05:10.910 --> 05:13.250
<b>Or perhaps your granddaughter?</b>

05:16.510 --> 05:18.000
<b>My lover.</b>

05:19.910 --> 05:22.140
<b>She'd been hospitalized for a long time.</b>

05:23.030 --> 05:25.170
<b>She was in a coma.</b>

05:26.290 --> 05:27.590
<b>A few days ago,</b>

05:28.490 --> 05:31.130
<b>she passed away in her sleep.</b>

05:32.620 --> 05:37.430
<b>I suppose she didn't want people 
thinking she wanted my money,</b>

05:37.870 --> 05:41.000
<b>because she returned every gift I gave her.</b>

05:43.070 --> 05:44.880
<b>But she loved</b>

05:45.400 --> 05:49.480
<b>this shoddy picture frame that I made myself.</b>

05:53.450 --> 05:56.060
<b>All we ever needed was one other.</b>

05:57.110 --> 06:00.540
<b>We swore that we would never be apart...</b>

06:03.710 --> 06:05.020
<b>Until the accident</b>

06:05.870 --> 06:10.190
<b>that put her into a sleep from 
which she'd never wake...</b>

06:13.070 --> 06:14.560
<b>Indeed...</b>

06:17.560 --> 06:21.310
<b>She appeared to only be sleeping...</b>

06:24.370 --> 06:28.820
<b>That was when I heard about <i>Greed Island</i>.</b>

06:29.930 --> 06:39.710
<b>Breath of Archangel

<b>that I need most, like a dream come true.</b>

06:40.090 --> 06:45.050
<b>I was prepared to spend my

06:48.750 --> 06:51.280
<b>But it doesn't matter any longer...</b>

06:52.830 --> 06:54.390
<b>It doesn't matter...</b>

07:00.450 --> 07:03.370
<b>The kids have four copies of 
Accompany among them.</b>

07:03.800 --> 07:05.540
<b>We have six.</b>

07:05.540 --> 07:06.670
<b>Shall we go, then?</b>

07:06.670 --> 07:07.520
<b>Yeah.</b>

07:07.520 --> 07:09.110
<b>Whenever you're ready.</b>

07:09.110 --> 07:12.220
<b>I'll take the kid with spiky black hair.</b>

<b>Don't be so hostile.</b>

07:29.850 --> 07:31.380
<b>We're here to propose a deal.</b>

07:31.700 --> 07:32.750
<b>A deal?</b>

07:32.750 --> 07:34.140
<b>We aren't interested!</b>

07:35.480 --> 07:37.830
<b><i>Right, don't let them notice</i></b>

07:38.460 --> 07:41.520
<b><i>that we've been waiting for them, 
completely prepared.</i></b>

07:42.220 --> 07:44.070
<b>It's not a bad deal.</b>

07:44.070 --> 07:47.400
<b>We have a good idea that Tsezgerra approved.</b>

07:47.700 --> 07:48.530
<b>What is it?</b>

07:48.530 --> 07:49.830
<b>Interested now?</b>

07:49.830 --> 07:52.400
<b>Stop! Talk from where you are!</b>

07:53.210 --> 07:54.880
<b><i>Yes, that's good.</i></b>

07:55.220 --> 07:59.160
<b><i>We must act like we're at a 
significant disadvantage.</i></b>

07:59.740 --> 08:03.030
<b><i>We have to convince them</i></b>

08:03.030 --> 08:06.170
<b><i>that we're being forced into this position.</i></b>

08:06.550 --> 08:08.670
<b>It's quite simple.</b>

08:09.190 --> 08:13.710
<b>We'll beat the game on everyone's behalf,

08:13.710 --> 08:16.180
<b>And we'll split Battera's reward.</b>

08:16.610 --> 08:18.430
<b>I find that hard to believe.</b>

08:18.430 --> 08:20.730
<b>We've had a change of heart.</b>

08:20.730 --> 08:23.690
<b>And Tsezgerra has already left the game.</b>

08:23.970 --> 08:27.680
<b>But that doesn't prove that

08:27.680 --> 08:29.440

<b>Do you want to die?</b>

08:34.220 --> 08:36.830
<b>Stop whining, and hand over your cards!</b>

13:05.760 --> 13:07.870
<b><i>At this point, you're nowhere near his level.</i></b>

13:08.220 --> 13:10.870
<b><i>You won't be able to deal significant damage.</i></b>

13:11.560 --> 13:13.020
<b><i>But continue to attack!</i></b>

13:17.660 --> 13:19.230
<b><i>Because he will still defeat you.</i></b>

13:22.820 --> 13:25.240
<b>You still haven't answered my question.</b>

13:25.680 --> 13:28.380
<b>Who told you about my power?</b>

13:30.100 --> 13:32.070
<b>Well, it isn't important now.</b>

13:32.070 --> 13:33.500
<b>My point is</b>

13:34.200 --> 13:37.750
<b>that I don't need my ability to deal with you.</b>

13:40.630 --> 13:42.250
<b><i>All according to plan.</i></b>

13:42.860 --> 13:45.830
<b><i>Once he's seen how much stronger he is,</i></b>

13:45.830 --> 13:48.680
<b><i>we'll begin to lure him into our trap!</i></b>

13:49.210 --> 13:50.000
<b><i>Osu!</i></b>

13:51.260 --> 13:53.120
<b><i>That's how I'd like to respond...</i></b>

13:54.300 --> 13:57.390
<b><i>But I don't like the idea of 
being totally manhandled.</i></b>

13:59.350 --> 14:01.050
<b><i>I'll make him use his power...</i></b>

14:01.050 --> 14:03.010
<b><i>I'll carry out the plan afterwards!</i></b>

14:05.020 --> 14:07.790
<b>Looks like you need a little more pain!</b>

14:25.860 --> 14:27.260
<b><i>Use your power.</i></b>

14:27.260 --> 14:29.510
<b><i>I have a surprise for you!</i></b>

14:29.980 --> 14:31.520
<b><i>I see what you're thinking.</i></b>

14:32.790 --> 14:34.140
<b><i>I won't use it!</i></b>

14:43.530 --> 14:44.660
<b><i>Damned kid!</i></b>

14:50.840 --> 14:52.990
<b><i>She's faster than I expected.</i></b>

14:53.990 --> 14:55.070
<b><i>Book!</i></b>

14:55.830 --> 14:58.500
<b><i>She should be out of teleportation spells.</i></b>

14:59.280 --> 15:00.240
<b><i>What's she doing?</i></b>

15:01.870 --> 15:05.000
<b><i>She used Transform to hide 
it as a different card?</i></b>

15:05.440 --> 15:06.860
<b><i>Accompany on!</i></b>

15:06.860 --> 15:07.950
<b>To Soufrabi!</b>

15:08.450 --> 15:09.370
<b><i>Accompany?</i></b>

15:09.760 --> 15:10.380
<b><i>Why?</i></b>

15:19.360 --> 15:21.020
<b>I don't get it...</b>

15:21.580 --> 15:26.780
<b>Why would you go to all this 
trouble to be alone with me?</b>

15:27.380 --> 15:29.010
<b>One reason...</b>

15:29.010 --> 15:32.820
<b>Because I didn't want to let you cry for help.</b>

15:32.820 --> 15:33.850
<b>Huh?</b>

15:33.850 --> 15:35.980
<b>I have no idea what you're talking about.</b>

15:35.980 --> 15:37.200
<b>You're such a fool...</b>

15:37.830 --> 15:40.580
<b>I'm telling you that I'm stronger.</b>

15:48.590 --> 15:50.270
<b>Damned brat!</b>

16:02.740 --> 16:04.900
<b>Your attacks are too weak...</b>

16:05.330 --> 16:07.730
<b>You can't defeat me!</b>

16:12.530 --> 16:14.540
<b>I won't hold back...</b>

16:14.540 --> 16:15.990
<b>So don't blame me.</b>

16:17.540 --> 16:19.800
<b>That's what I was going to say.</b>

16:22.220 --> 16:26.630
<b>I was being nice, so I let you hit me once.</b>

16:27.230 --> 16:31.590
<b>Because I can't restrain myself when I revert.</b>

16:34.040 --> 16:36.620
<b>And I end up killing my opponents!</b>

16:45.370 --> 16:47.730
<b>Oh, you're alive?</b>

16:47.730 --> 16:49.170
<b>I'm impressed.</b>

16:49.170 --> 16:52.730
<b>Why would you...</b>

16:53.270 --> 16:55.180
<b>hide your power?</b>

16:55.180 --> 16:56.570
<b>Two reasons...</b>

16:57.100 --> 16:59.260
<b>The ace up your sleeve should remain hidden...</b>

16:59.260 --> 17:02.670
<b>And more than anything, I hate the way I look.</b>

17:03.140 --> 17:05.040
<b>Too macho!</b>

17:05.940 --> 17:07.990
<b>Don't you agree?</b>

17:11.660 --> 17:13.330
<b>He can't hear me anymore?</b>

17:20.490 --> 17:22.920
<b><i>I have a slight advantage in martial 
skill and physical strength.</i></b>

17:23.240 --> 17:25.690
<b><i>But he has me beat in aura capacity.</i></b>

17:26.820 --> 17:30.610
<b><i>I probably won't be able to hurt 
him with any normal attack.</i></b>

17:31.000 --> 17:33.490
<b><i>Which makes him perfect to experiment on.</i></b>

17:37.880 --> 17:38.840
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

17:38.840 --> 17:41.570
<b><i>I felt that hit inside my head.</i></b>

17:42.120 --> 17:43.990
<b><i>I can't afford to fool around.</i></b>

17:52.690 --> 17:53.460
<b>Wrong.</b>

17:54.040 --> 17:55.760
<b><i>Experiment #1...</i></b>

17:57.250 --> 17:58.350
<b><i>Lightning Palm!</i></b>

17:57.470 --> 17:59.220
<b>Lightning Palm</b>

18:02.470 --> 18:05.040
<b><i>Doesn't seem to be enough to knock him out.</i></b>

18:05.290 --> 18:07.750
<b><i>But I can immobilize him for a few seconds.</i></b>

18:08.810 --> 18:09.810
<b><i>Okay.</i></b>

18:10.820 --> 18:12.480
<b><i>Experiment #2...</i></b>

18:12.700 --> 18:13.980
<b><i>A yo-yo?</i></b>

18:18.650 --> 18:19.490
<b>Let's do this.</b>

18:19.750 --> 18:21.490
<b><i>What's he up to?</i></b>

18:28.830 --> 18:31.160
<b>What's that thing made of?</b>

18:33.500 --> 18:36.630
<b>This is a superalloy yo-yo my brother ordered.</b>

18:37.180 --> 18:39.130
<b>It weighs around fifty kilograms,</b>

18:39.540 --> 18:41.390
<b>so it packs quite a punch!</b>

18:41.830 --> 18:42.890
<b>Whoa!</b>

18:50.520 --> 18:51.400
<b>Damn...</b>

18:52.320 --> 18:55.760
<b><i>Between the weight and centrifugal 
force, that really hurts.</i></b>

18:58.150 --> 19:00.830
<b><i>He always leaves his right side exposed</i></b>

19:00.830 --> 19:02.510
<b><i>when I attack a certain way!</i></b>

19:03.170 --> 19:06.950
<b><i>If I take his yo-yo, leaving him empty-handed,</i></b>

19:08.510 --> 19:10.870
<b><i>he'll make the same mistake!</i></b>

19:13.670 --> 19:14.550
<b><i>My chance!</i></b>

19:16.470 --> 19:17.530
<b><i>There!</i></b>

19:21.500 --> 19:22.420
<b>Yes!</b>

19:22.420 --> 19:24.050
<b>Time to crush you!</b>

19:27.930 --> 19:29.010
<b>Oh?</b>

19:29.010 --> 19:31.690
<b>Did I forget to mention that I have two yo-yos?</b>

19:37.130 --> 19:39.450
<b>Wow, you're still conscious?</b>

19:39.790 --> 19:41.150
<b>Did you know that</b>

19:41.150 --> 19:44.360
<b>when you kick me, you raise your 
guarding arm on the other side?</b>

19:44.360 --> 19:46.700
<b>You're creating your own blind spot.</b>

19:47.900 --> 19:52.590
<b><i>He used my blind spot to pull 
out a yo-yo and attack?</i></b>

19:53.610 --> 19:56.210
<b>Then your defensive habit...</b>

19:56.620 --> 19:59.720
<b>Was a fake to make you 
kick me with your left leg.</b>

20:00.050 --> 20:02.050
<b>And when you released your first yo-yo...</b>

20:02.450 --> 20:05.850
<b>I knew you picked up something to throw at me.</b>

20:06.330 --> 20:08.720
<b>Why did you use Accompany to 
draw me away from the others?</b>

20:09.050 --> 20:12.980
<b>To make you focus on a one-on-one chance, 
so you'd lose track of your surroundings.</b>

20:13.610 --> 20:15.330
<b>I don't believe it..</b>

20:15.330 --> 20:19.490
<b>You set three traps during that brief exchange?</b>

20:19.760 --> 20:20.700
<b>Three?</b>

20:20.700 --> 20:22.500
<b>You must be joking...</b>

20:22.810 --> 20:24.870
<b>Every move I made was a trap.</b>

20:31.060 --> 20:32.910
<b>Experiment complete!</b>

20:32.910 --> 20:34.280
<b>Both work.</b>

20:39.620 --> 20:42.130
<b>Why won't you accept your fate?</b>

20:42.660 --> 20:44.500
<b>You can't beat me.</b>

20:45.340 --> 20:46.610
<b>No way.</b>

20:47.680 --> 20:48.770
<b>I...</b>

20:50.150 --> 20:51.800
<b>I haven't lost yet!</b>

20:54.290 --> 20:56.900
<b><i>I was mistaken.</i></b>

20:58.150 --> 21:00.130
<b>I take back what I said.</b>

21:01.050 --> 21:02.870
<b>You are strong...</b>

21:05.400 --> 21:08.890
<b>I will show you my power.</b>

21:11.890 --> 21:15.080
<b><i>This battle is mental, not physical.</i></b>

21:15.600 --> 21:17.860
<b><i>I must crush his will.</i></b>

21:17.860 --> 21:20.670
<b><i>His will to fight, his will to stand,</i></b>

21:20.670 --> 21:22.670
<b><i>his will to resist.</i></b>

21:23.330 --> 21:26.510
<b><i>Otherwise, he'll never admit defeat...</i></b>

21:27.670 --> 21:30.900
<b><i>To win, I must swallow my 
pride and play it smart.</i></b>

21:30.900 --> 21:38.110
<b><i>Let me demonstrate that all your hard 
work and confidence mean nothing!</i></b>

21:38.630 --> 21:39.690
<b><i>Here he comes.</i></b>

21:43.660 --> 21:46.620
<b>The devilish man has unleashed his true power.</b>

21:46.620 --> 21:49.830
<b>Can Gon emerge victorious?</b>

23:01.190 --> 23:08.110
<b>G.I. Tutorial</b>

23:01.910 --> 23:04.840
<b>Coming up, it's the 
Greed Island Tutorial!</b>

23:07.070 --> 23:09.700
<b>Today, we introduce the card Breath of Archangel.</b>

23:08.110 --> 23:19.160
<b>Breath of Archangel 

An angel that cures any 
mortal injury or terminal 
illness with one breath. 
But angel only appears once.</b>

23:09.700 --> 23:11.900
<b>A card that can cure injury and disease.</b>

23:11.900 --> 23:13.690
<b>Mito-san used this all the time.</b>

23:13.690 --> 23:14.310
<b>Huh?</b>

23:14.310 --> 23:16.870
<b>Boo-boos, begone!</b>

23:19.550 --> 23:21.290
<b>Continue!</b>

23:25.110 --> 23:27.420
<b>Next time: Victor x And x Loser.</b>

23:27.420 --> 23:29.260
<b>Ow! That hurts...</b>

23:29.260 --> 23:30.380
<b>What's wrong, Killua?</b>

23:30.380 --> 23:32.200
<b>My tooth hurts...</b>

23:32.200 --> 23:34.390
<b>Good kids always brush their teeth.</b>
