WEBVTT

00:00.449 --> 00:04.118
The Carmichael Show is taped in
front of a live studio audience.

00:04.119 --> 00:06.390
Maxine... can you believe Whole Foods

00:06.391 --> 00:08.424
tried to get me to buy a reusable bag?

00:08.425 --> 00:09.925
Why's everybody pretending to care

00:09.926 --> 00:11.394
about the environment right now?

00:11.395 --> 00:13.829
You cannot realistically
care about the future

00:13.830 --> 00:15.563
of your great-great-grandchildren.

00:17.099 --> 00:20.236
(sighs) Look, Jerrod, my dad
is in town for only 48 hours.

00:20.237 --> 00:22.705
So, just dinner tonight,
graduation tomorrow, that's it.

00:22.706 --> 00:24.573
So, I just really want this to go well.

00:24.574 --> 00:27.076
He has unreasonably high standards.

00:27.077 --> 00:30.079
So why am I looking at a bottle
of wine with a screw off top?

00:30.080 --> 00:32.046
Because screw tops are in right now.

00:32.048 --> 00:34.784
Don't you listen to NPR?

00:34.785 --> 00:36.318
I just want my dad to like you.

00:36.319 --> 00:38.154
Don't worry. Just relax.

00:38.155 --> 00:40.089
He's gonna like me.
He's gonna love me, actually.

00:40.090 --> 00:42.124
You know, I can charm rich
people really easily,

00:42.125 --> 00:44.627
'cause all you got to do is
bring up the play <i>Hamilton.</i>

00:44.628 --> 00:45.895
Seriously,

00:45.896 --> 00:47.730
rich people love that. I don't know

00:47.731 --> 00:50.666
if the Illuminati is real,
but if so, "Hamilton"

00:50.667 --> 00:53.135
is definitely the password
to get into their meetings.

00:53.136 --> 00:56.605
Look, I think it's gonna take
a little bit more than <i>Hamilton</i>

00:56.606 --> 00:59.341
to impress my dad.
He is impossible to please.

00:59.342 --> 01:01.277
You know, all through
school I got straight A's

01:01.278 --> 01:03.112
until the tenth grade...
I got my first B

01:03.113 --> 01:05.346
- and he took away my car for a month.
- Whoa, whoa.

01:05.348 --> 01:08.149
You had a car in tenth grade?

01:09.018 --> 01:10.519
- It was used.
- Okay,

01:10.520 --> 01:13.001
make and model, right now. And
I'm making eye contact with you,

01:13.002 --> 01:14.168
so don't lie to me.

01:14.169 --> 01:16.190
It was a BMW 325.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.596
- You were such an abused child, Maxine.
- (knocking)

01:20.597 --> 01:22.064
Oh, my God,

01:22.065 --> 01:23.568
they should make a sequel to <i>Precious</i>

01:23.569 --> 01:24.567
based off your life.

01:24.568 --> 01:27.203
We should tell Syrian
refugees your story

01:27.204 --> 01:28.787
so they won't want to
come here anymore.

01:28.788 --> 01:30.339
Okay, just open the door.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.507
Okay, one more.
You're the American Malala.

01:33.569 --> 01:35.010
Maxine, is your rich daddy here yet?

01:35.011 --> 01:36.545
- How are you, sweetie?
- Uh...

01:36.546 --> 01:39.648
I want to ask him how much money
he got, 'cause I'm curious.

01:39.649 --> 01:41.484
- Don't do that.
- No, I'm gonna do it.

01:41.485 --> 01:44.987
No, no. As a reminder,

01:44.988 --> 01:47.756
rich people don't like being
called rich to their face.

01:47.757 --> 01:50.259
That's why we came up with
the term upper middle class.

01:50.260 --> 01:53.929
(chuckles) Now, Maxine, we know
that your dad is gonna probably

01:53.930 --> 01:56.999
give you a big, fancy graduation gift.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.734
But we didn't want to
compete with that,

01:58.735 --> 02:01.170
so I decided to give you

02:01.171 --> 02:04.172
three sincere hugs.

02:05.140 --> 02:07.209
Here's the first one.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.544
Oh.

02:09.545 --> 02:11.247
Oh, God, that feels so good.

02:11.248 --> 02:13.849
Ooh! Yes, I know.

02:13.850 --> 02:16.452
That's why I don't go around
just giving those things out.

02:16.453 --> 02:20.222
That was from me, too.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.457
Hey, y'all.

02:21.458 --> 02:23.259
We are ready for our free steak dinner.

02:23.260 --> 02:25.194
Again, Bobby, the dinner's not free.

02:25.195 --> 02:26.695
I'm paying for it.

02:26.696 --> 02:28.519
Well, Jerrod, look, just a heads-up.
I'm gonna

02:28.520 --> 02:31.500
do that thing where I go grab my
wallet and say, "Oh, man, no...

02:31.501 --> 02:33.536
you got it last time. Allow me."

02:33.537 --> 02:35.604
But just know that's
just a empty gesture

02:35.605 --> 02:37.907
I do in front of company.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.842
Do not take me up on that offer.

02:39.843 --> 02:42.611
So, I know Jerrod said that
we can't ask how much money

02:42.612 --> 02:45.281
your rich daddy got,
but, um, what does he do?

02:45.282 --> 02:46.705
Uh, he's in commercial real estate.

02:46.706 --> 02:48.918
Commercial real estate?

02:48.919 --> 02:51.453
Ooh, la, la.

02:51.454 --> 02:53.756
Wait, is your mom coming, Maxine?

02:53.757 --> 02:55.891
Well, if my memory serves me correctly,

02:55.892 --> 02:58.427
Maxine's mom is bogged down

02:58.428 --> 03:00.696
in booze and-and pills

03:00.697 --> 03:02.965
and refuses to be in a
room with Maxine's dad

03:02.966 --> 03:04.733
since the divorce.

03:04.734 --> 03:06.367
Did I get it right?

03:07.770 --> 03:09.939
Is that's why she's not here?

03:09.940 --> 03:12.474
Did I get it right?

03:12.475 --> 03:14.510
Yeah, pretty much.

03:14.511 --> 03:15.811
Hey, honey, good memory.

03:15.812 --> 03:19.648
Yeah, that multi-vitamin
is just paying for itself.

03:19.649 --> 03:22.751
Okay, um, I'm gonna go
finish getting ready.

03:22.752 --> 03:24.053
But don't let that stop you

03:24.054 --> 03:26.021
from talking about my
dysfunctional family.

03:26.022 --> 03:27.856
Okay.

03:27.857 --> 03:30.558
You know, her cousin is
in jail on a hit and run.

03:32.294 --> 03:33.996
Look... Look, all right?

03:33.997 --> 03:36.465
This dinner is really
important to Maxine,

03:36.466 --> 03:39.101
so when we get to the
restaurant don't talk about

03:39.102 --> 03:40.569
how expensive the menu is,

03:40.570 --> 03:42.571
and nobody's gonna split
a steak to save money,

03:42.572 --> 03:46.208
and nobody is gonna order a
red wine with Coke in it.

03:46.209 --> 03:48.277
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:48.278 --> 03:49.919
Look here, Jerrod,
it's called a Calimocho

03:49.920 --> 03:51.187
and they drink it in Spain.

03:51.188 --> 03:52.348
Yeah.

03:52.349 --> 03:55.584
You think you better than
the Spanish, Jerrod? Huh?

03:55.585 --> 03:57.719
Yes.

04:00.356 --> 04:02.858
I don't like this special effort

04:02.859 --> 04:06.495
we're having to give this
man just because he's rich.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.597
Well, of course rich people
get special treatment.

04:08.598 --> 04:11.066
They earned it. Shoot, if I'm driving

04:11.067 --> 04:13.369
and somebody cuts me off
in traffic in a Mercedes,

04:13.370 --> 04:15.037
I don't even get mad.

04:15.038 --> 04:17.339
I just say to myself
that is a Mercedes man

04:17.339 --> 04:19.841
and he's probably got
Mercedes things to do.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.709
Go on with your day.

04:21.711 --> 04:23.012
But, now...

04:23.013 --> 04:25.080
say you cut me off in
traffic driving a Civic,

04:25.081 --> 04:27.116
well, I'm gonna lay on
the horn, and I will

04:27.117 --> 04:28.497
threaten you with some violence.

04:29.918 --> 04:31.920
Why you going in a hurry
in your damn Civic?!

04:31.921 --> 04:33.589
You ain't got no place to be.

04:33.590 --> 04:34.857
(knocking)

04:34.858 --> 04:36.458
Oh, he's here.

04:36.459 --> 04:39.628
Oh, I'm gonna say
"charmed" when I meet him.

04:39.629 --> 04:42.031
Rich people love to say "charmed"

04:42.032 --> 04:43.298
when they greet each other.

04:43.299 --> 04:45.467
(chuckles) Hi, Dad.

04:45.468 --> 04:46.534
Charmed.

04:47.369 --> 04:49.405
Oh, it's so good to see you.

04:49.406 --> 04:50.906
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

04:50.907 --> 04:53.742
They tried to force a Prius
on me at the car rental place.

04:53.743 --> 04:56.878
If I wanted a golf cart,
I would've asked for one.

04:58.013 --> 04:59.996
Oh, that's okay. Uh, this
is my boyfriend, Jerrod.

04:59.997 --> 05:01.050
Hey.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.751
- You're white.
- Uh...

05:02.752 --> 05:05.620
Yeah. Yeah, I really lucked out there.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.262
Now, Maxine, I've been making
jokes about your daddy

05:13.263 --> 05:16.298
all this time 'cause I figured
he was the black one.

05:16.299 --> 05:18.362
You never hear about white
men marrying black women,

05:18.363 --> 05:19.601
except for, um...

05:19.602 --> 05:21.736
that Robert De Niro and Ebert.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.206
George Lucas.

05:24.207 --> 05:25.474
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

05:25.475 --> 05:27.209
Wait, do you have to
have a billion dollars

05:27.210 --> 05:28.744
to be white and marry a black woman?

05:28.745 --> 05:30.679
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, Mr. North,

05:30.680 --> 05:32.581
<i>Hamilton... let's talk about it.</i>

05:32.582 --> 05:34.917
Hamilton, the, uh, play?
That's an odd thing

05:34.918 --> 05:37.553
- to just randomly bring up.
- Yeah, yeah, but you saw it, right?

05:37.554 --> 05:39.021
What did you think? You like it?

05:39.022 --> 05:42.691
It was the most incredible
experience of my life.

05:42.692 --> 05:44.927
I sat right next to
Josh Groban all night

05:44.928 --> 05:47.129
as tears went down his face.

05:47.130 --> 05:49.498
See, Maxine?
Everything's gonna be great.

Commercial real estate, huh?

That's right.

06:27.848 --> 06:29.151
I'm in the moving business,

so there's a little bit of

06:31.788 --> 06:34.323
(clears throat) See, I move
furniture into buildings,

So, how much money you really got?

Dad! No.

Cynthia, uh, Maxine has
told me a lot about you.

06:46.937 --> 06:49.538
Has she?

06:49.539 --> 06:52.207
Well, I have plenty to
say about her, too.

- Um... uh, Dad, do you want some wine?
- Sure.

06:55.312 --> 06:58.047
Grant, tell us something
embarrassing about Maxine

06:58.048 --> 06:59.749
so we can tease her.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.984
Well, let's see.
Uh, when she was young she, uh,

07:01.985 --> 07:04.253
sucked her thumb. Only way
we could get her to stop

07:04.254 --> 07:06.255
was to tell her someone
was gonna cut it off

07:06.256 --> 07:08.423
with big, sharp scissors. (chuckles)

07:09.692 --> 07:11.527
You know, like...

07:11.528 --> 07:13.829
in the... the nursery rhyme.

07:13.830 --> 07:17.433
What the hell nursery rhyme is that?

07:17.434 --> 07:21.137
It's German. They used to read
it to us in the foster home.

07:21.138 --> 07:23.873
I like you.

07:23.874 --> 07:26.142
Yeah, the Germans really know

07:26.143 --> 07:27.576
how to get a point across, huh?

07:27.577 --> 07:30.513
Maxine, listen, I-I can't
wait until tomorrow

07:30.514 --> 07:33.149
to give you your graduation gift.
You got to open it now.

07:33.150 --> 07:35.084
Is it a ticket to go around the world?

07:35.085 --> 07:38.186
'Cause I'd love to see Maxine
take a trip around the world.

07:39.789 --> 07:41.123
Wait, you got me a job interview?

07:41.124 --> 07:44.059
To be the psychologist at a
prestigious private school

07:44.060 --> 07:46.429
in Charlotte. It's a good
job for a starter city.

07:46.430 --> 07:47.897
Truth be told, the interview's

07:47.898 --> 07:50.733
just a formality. The job
is already yours, honey.

07:50.734 --> 07:52.334
- Congratulations.
- Oh...

07:52.335 --> 07:54.670
- Happy graduation.
- Uh, well,

07:54.671 --> 07:56.572
I appreciate what you're
trying to do here, Dad,

07:56.573 --> 07:58.507
but, um, I already have a job lined up.

07:58.508 --> 07:59.971
I'm gonna be a county social worker.

07:59.972 --> 08:01.544
Ugh, county?

08:01.545 --> 08:03.012
GRANT: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

08:03.013 --> 08:05.414
that-that sounds like
community service.

08:05.415 --> 08:07.950
Did you get a DUI?
Why didn't you call me?

08:07.951 --> 08:09.685
You know I can get those things erased.

08:09.686 --> 08:12.721
Uh, thank you, but I-I'm
gonna be a social worker.

08:12.722 --> 08:15.458
Maxine, now, I'm sure there
were a lot of people

08:15.459 --> 08:17.092
who were way more qualified than you

08:17.093 --> 08:19.128
that your daddy had to
bump out of the way

08:19.129 --> 08:20.763
in order for you to get this job.

08:20.764 --> 08:23.499
And I think it's a little
inconsiderate for you

08:23.500 --> 08:26.769
not to step on they heads
on your way up to the top.

08:26.770 --> 08:29.371
Well, that's not the job that I want.

08:29.372 --> 08:31.740
Hon, I didn't pay for
seven years of college

08:31.741 --> 08:33.375
for you to go into social work.

08:33.376 --> 08:36.145
Maxine, you went to college for
seven years just to explain

08:36.145 --> 08:39.380
how to use a EBT card
to single mothers?

08:40.982 --> 08:44.520
It's just like a debit card.
It's not that hard.

08:44.521 --> 08:46.088
Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.

08:46.089 --> 08:49.925
Just because Maxine is taking
a potentially dangerous job

08:49.926 --> 08:53.562
with the county and passing
up on a maybe lucrative job

08:53.563 --> 08:56.098
that's high-paying... is it...
It is high-paying, right?

08:56.099 --> 08:57.800
Well, it starts at $70,000.

08:57.801 --> 09:01.337
Starts? Good gracious.

09:01.338 --> 09:03.072
Uh, just because she's
turning that down

09:03.073 --> 09:06.509
doesn't mean it's a bad decision.

09:06.510 --> 09:08.543
I support you, Maxine, no matter what.

09:10.112 --> 09:12.615
You know, one of the hardest
things a parent has to do

09:12.616 --> 09:15.751
is to smile as they
watch their children

09:15.752 --> 09:17.786
make terrible mistakes.

09:17.787 --> 09:19.755
Go ahead,

09:19.756 --> 09:21.556
smile.

09:22.725 --> 09:25.628
You're not smiling.

09:25.629 --> 09:27.363
I'm sorry, but is your family

09:27.364 --> 09:30.332
gonna comment on everything we say?

09:30.333 --> 09:32.535
No, we're just gonna sit here

09:32.536 --> 09:35.269
and politely mind our own business.

09:39.174 --> 09:42.311
Look, Dad, thank you

09:42.312 --> 09:44.547
so much for paying for my education.

09:44.548 --> 09:46.181
But just because I'm grateful

09:46.182 --> 09:47.750
doesn't mean I owe you.

09:47.751 --> 09:49.018
Oh, yes, you do.

09:49.019 --> 09:50.719
You are an investment, okay?

09:50.720 --> 09:54.323
I spent time and money on you.
I expect you to capitalize

09:54.324 --> 09:56.058
on the opportunities I provide.

09:56.059 --> 09:58.694
It's called love, sweetheart.

09:58.695 --> 10:01.363
Dad, I don't just want to help
rich private school kids.

10:01.364 --> 10:03.098
I want to help people
in the real world.

10:03.099 --> 10:04.967
You don't live in the real world.

10:04.968 --> 10:08.804
You live in a protected bubble
that I created for you.

10:08.805 --> 10:12.107
I'm gonna be very disappointed
if you turn this job down.

10:12.108 --> 10:14.509
Why does your love always
have to have conditions?

10:15.544 --> 10:18.480
Conditional love is what
drives people to succeed.

10:18.481 --> 10:20.182
Why do you think I'm a success?

10:20.183 --> 10:22.551
It's because my father withheld

10:22.552 --> 10:23.919
as much love as humanly possible.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.254
I had to earn it.

10:25.255 --> 10:27.489
Do you think I would have
bought that bastard a house

10:27.490 --> 10:30.993
if he just loved me no matter what?

10:30.994 --> 10:33.529
Well, the Carmichaels love
their sons unconditionally.

10:33.530 --> 10:36.030
Well, hold on, now, hold on.

10:37.066 --> 10:39.201
I think Grant is onto something here.

10:39.202 --> 10:41.971
Boys, you're both unlovable... now,
go out and make a bunch of money

10:41.972 --> 10:43.337
and buy me a big house.

10:44.239 --> 10:45.374
GRANT: How do you intend

10:45.375 --> 10:47.376
to earn a living as a social worker?

10:47.377 --> 10:49.345
Not everything is about money.

10:49.346 --> 10:50.713
Well, that's easy for you to say

10:50.714 --> 10:52.657
when I've been paying your
bills your whole life.

10:52.658 --> 10:54.617
Maybe it's time for that to stop.

10:54.618 --> 10:56.352
Let you and your live-in boyfriend

10:56.353 --> 10:58.153
figure out what the real world costs.

10:58.154 --> 10:59.888
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:59.889 --> 11:02.224
Hey, now, you-you know
what I think, Grant?

11:02.225 --> 11:03.425
I think that we're
saying a lot of things

11:03.426 --> 11:05.094
we don't mean because we're hungry.

11:05.095 --> 11:06.495
Let's just go to the restaurant,

11:06.496 --> 11:07.857
get a couple steaks in that belly,

11:07.858 --> 11:09.558
then we'll decide who
pays what bill later.

11:09.559 --> 11:10.733
You know what, Dad?

11:10.734 --> 11:13.736
Keep your money.
I'm making my own decisions now,

11:13.737 --> 11:16.839
and I don't need you and your
judgment hanging over my head.

11:16.840 --> 11:20.309
Really? So then I guess you
won't need <i>this,</i> right?

11:20.310 --> 11:22.211
This is a $10,000 check

11:22.212 --> 11:24.013
for your final school payment.

11:24.014 --> 11:26.415
Now, I get that you
want to be independent,

11:26.416 --> 11:28.549
but you are not ready.

11:30.786 --> 11:32.321
No.

11:32.322 --> 11:33.856
I'm ready.

11:33.857 --> 11:35.190
(gasping)

11:35.191 --> 11:37.792
Oh. I wasn't ready.

11:39.628 --> 11:41.430
And you know what,

11:41.431 --> 11:43.312
if you're not gonna support
me and my decisions,

11:43.313 --> 11:45.314
I don't see any reason
for you to even be here.

11:45.315 --> 11:47.369
Really? Well, then I...

11:47.370 --> 11:50.072
guess there's not
anything else to talk about.

11:50.073 --> 11:51.739
I guess not.

11:53.409 --> 11:55.343
(sighs heavily)

12:01.216 --> 12:04.385
Good luck on your graduation tomorrow.

12:06.388 --> 12:07.955
Come here, sweetie.

12:10.025 --> 12:12.026
Oh, come on.

12:16.799 --> 12:19.567
Only one more to go.

12:22.010 --> 12:25.413
I can't believe I tore
up a $10,000 check.

12:25.414 --> 12:27.395
And that I stood up to my dad.

12:27.396 --> 12:31.165
Yeah, that was, uh...
that was something, Maxine.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.800
What?

12:32.801 --> 12:36.003
What's so bad about being a
therapist at a private school?

12:36.004 --> 12:37.171
I mean, think about, like,

12:37.172 --> 12:39.040
all the rich people
that need help, too.

12:39.041 --> 12:41.108
Think about Kim Kardashian, Khloe,

12:41.109 --> 12:43.010
uh, K... uh,

12:43.011 --> 12:43.945
Kourtney...

12:43.946 --> 12:45.112
Rob.

12:45.113 --> 12:46.881
Then you move on to your Jenners...

12:46.882 --> 12:48.582
you got your Kylies, your Kendalls...

12:48.583 --> 12:50.286
- Actually, Kendall's fine.
- You're right,

12:50.287 --> 12:52.153
Kendall <i>is</i> fine.

12:52.154 --> 12:54.822
Look, I know that this is hard...

12:54.823 --> 12:57.692
but I'm 28 years old and I
have never made one decision

12:57.693 --> 12:59.927
without worrying about
what my dad thinks.

12:59.928 --> 13:02.163
And it feels kind of amazing.

13:02.164 --> 13:04.598
Yes, all of that. But also,

13:04.599 --> 13:07.368
I don't have an extra $10,000.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.136
Well, I don't expect
you to pay for this.

13:09.137 --> 13:11.439
I'm-I'm gonna get, like, a night job.

13:11.440 --> 13:14.709
Maxine, if a night job could
get you a quick ten grand,

13:14.710 --> 13:16.010
then the whole one percent

13:16.011 --> 13:19.412
would be made up entirely
of Waffle House employees.

13:20.448 --> 13:22.816
Yeah, I could work at Waffle House.

13:23.851 --> 13:25.753
I mean, I'm... I'm pleasant.

13:25.754 --> 13:27.388
And I, uh...

13:27.389 --> 13:29.172
and I could wear my hair
up in a little knot,

13:29.173 --> 13:30.725
and I can call people "hon."

13:30.726 --> 13:33.861
Yeah, you know, I'm gonna go
check their job listings.

13:33.862 --> 13:36.930
Maxine, it'll never work...
your teeth are too nice.

13:37.965 --> 13:40.066
(knocking)

13:42.970 --> 13:45.573
Oh, my God, Grant, thank God
you're back in our lives.

13:45.574 --> 13:46.741
I'm gonna go get Maxine.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.342
No, no, no, no. I-I really wanted

13:48.343 --> 13:49.877
to talk to you for a second.

13:49.878 --> 13:52.146
Would you mind stepping
out in the hall with me?

13:52.147 --> 13:53.713
Okay.

13:56.283 --> 13:57.685
(sighs)

13:57.686 --> 13:59.653
Look, you-you seem like
a logical young man.

13:59.654 --> 14:01.856
You guys clearly need the money.

14:01.857 --> 14:03.657
Yeah, yeah, but we'll
find a way, Grant.

14:03.658 --> 14:06.293
How? Seriously, you have no means,

14:06.294 --> 14:08.896
you didn't go to college,
you live in an apartment...

14:08.897 --> 14:12.832
whatever money you do have is
<i>clearly</i> going to your shoes.

14:18.806 --> 14:20.107
Thank you.

14:20.108 --> 14:22.543
Yeah. So...

14:22.544 --> 14:23.911
here's what I want to do.

14:23.912 --> 14:25.579
I'm gonna make <i>you</i> out a check,

14:25.580 --> 14:27.548
and <i>you</i> cover that bill for Maxine,

14:27.549 --> 14:29.617
because right now she's
just being so stubborn

14:29.618 --> 14:32.319
that she doesn't know what
I'm doing is for the best.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.903
But look, Maxine's made it pretty clear

14:33.904 --> 14:35.523
that we can't take the money.

14:35.524 --> 14:37.691
She's made her decision,
and I support her.

14:37.692 --> 14:39.326
Okay, Jerrod,

14:39.327 --> 14:42.496
but when you realize that that
high horse that you're riding

14:42.497 --> 14:45.132
doesn't pay anything,
come to my hotel room...

14:45.133 --> 14:46.967
I'll give you the money.

14:46.968 --> 14:49.370
And just know that this offer expires

14:49.371 --> 14:52.138
when I leave town tomorrow morning.

14:57.678 --> 15:01.314
Damn. It's like a scene from <i>Chinatown.</i>

15:05.653 --> 15:07.021
Hey, y'all.

15:07.022 --> 15:08.656
All right, so get this.

15:08.657 --> 15:11.692
Grant came back to the house,
and then he offered me $10,000,

15:11.693 --> 15:15.029
but he said if I want it,
I got to go by his hotel room.

15:15.030 --> 15:18.432
Well, you're a good-lookin' boy.

15:18.433 --> 15:19.800
NEKEISHA: I don't know,

15:19.801 --> 15:22.169
I think it's kind of weird
that he would want to sleep

15:22.170 --> 15:24.538
with his daughter's boyfriend,
but, you know...

15:24.539 --> 15:27.108
rich people want what they want
and they gets what they get.

15:27.109 --> 15:29.810
- That is not what's happening, Nekeisha.
- Mm-hmm.

15:29.811 --> 15:31.812
Does Maxine know about this?

15:31.813 --> 15:33.147
No, I haven't told her.

15:33.148 --> 15:34.915
If she knew, she'd be really upset.

15:34.916 --> 15:37.785
I think maybe we should take
the money for her own good.

15:37.786 --> 15:40.688
Jerrod, do not take a
dime of that man's money.

15:40.689 --> 15:43.724
He wants something from you.
He was trying to buy Maxine.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.960
Now he's trying to buy you, too.

15:45.961 --> 15:48.429
Well, what's so bad about that?

15:48.430 --> 15:49.864
Is, uh,

15:49.865 --> 15:52.233
doing something you don't
want to do just for a check

15:52.234 --> 15:53.868
considered being bought? Because if so,

15:53.869 --> 15:55.803
I'm being bought every other Thursday.

15:55.804 --> 15:58.606
I'm doing a job I can't
stand, working for a boss

15:58.607 --> 16:01.041
I don't like, yet every
time I cash that check,

16:01.042 --> 16:03.611
I never heard you say...
(like Cynthia): "Your principles

16:03.612 --> 16:05.745
are worth more than that, Joe."

16:07.248 --> 16:08.716
See, Bobby can't be bought.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.317
Well, good for you, son.

16:10.318 --> 16:12.086
Now, Bobby <i>can</i> be leased.

16:12.087 --> 16:14.088
Yeah.

16:14.089 --> 16:17.024
For $10,000, man,
I'll do whatever you want.

16:17.025 --> 16:19.260
But just for a limited time.

16:19.261 --> 16:22.396
I'm like a Shamrock Shake.

16:22.397 --> 16:25.833
I'm trying to think of something
I <i>wouldn't</i> do for $10,000.

16:25.834 --> 16:27.868
I want to say betray my country,

16:27.869 --> 16:30.704
but $10,000!

16:30.705 --> 16:32.573
Whoo!

16:32.574 --> 16:34.455
Maybe I'm looking too far
into this whole thing.

16:34.456 --> 16:36.357
Maybe he really just wants
to help his daughter,

16:36.358 --> 16:37.545
and that's the end of it.

16:37.546 --> 16:39.079
Think about it, Jerrod,

16:39.080 --> 16:41.382
why would he be offering <i>you</i> the money

16:41.383 --> 16:44.451
when he can just send it
directly to the school?

16:44.452 --> 16:46.654
It's a test. It's a power play.

16:46.655 --> 16:49.256
That man is like a
villain in a soap opera,

16:49.257 --> 16:51.258
and I have seen enough Erica Kane

16:51.259 --> 16:53.961
to know when something is loaded!

16:53.962 --> 16:56.430
Now, if you go and get that money,

16:56.431 --> 16:59.233
then you owe him.

16:59.234 --> 17:01.502
Now, you think you can live with that?

17:01.503 --> 17:02.903
Listen to me, son.

17:02.904 --> 17:05.739
There's only a few times in
life when someone shows up

17:05.740 --> 17:08.541
and has an immediate cure
to all of your money problems.

17:08.542 --> 17:09.977
Do the right thing.

17:09.978 --> 17:11.978
- Sell your soul.
- (gasps)

17:17.218 --> 17:19.987
Jerrod. I had a feeling
I might be seeing you.

17:19.988 --> 17:22.223
What do you want from me, Grant?

17:22.223 --> 17:25.159
I really just want what's
best for my daughter.

17:25.160 --> 17:27.394
Yeah, yeah, but you're not
giving <i>her</i> the money,

17:27.395 --> 17:29.496
you're trying to give <i>me</i> the money.

17:29.497 --> 17:31.098
So if I take it...

17:31.099 --> 17:32.965
what do you want in return?

17:33.801 --> 17:36.736
I want you to... kill my ex-wife.

17:37.771 --> 17:39.473
Really?

17:39.474 --> 17:42.676
Oh, my God, are you willing to do that?

17:42.677 --> 17:46.714
N-No, but... I could make a few calls.

17:46.715 --> 17:48.148
No, no, no, no, no, no. No.

17:48.149 --> 17:51.151
N-Nobody's killing anyone. I-I...

17:51.152 --> 17:52.393
Well, what's all of this about?

17:52.394 --> 17:53.961
- Is this a test or something?
- (sighs)

17:53.962 --> 17:56.190
You know, I have never
had this much trouble

17:56.191 --> 17:57.925
giving away $10,000.

17:57.926 --> 17:59.193
What is going on?

17:59.194 --> 18:01.495
Jerrod, I thought you would
be the clearheaded one,

18:01.496 --> 18:03.731
but you are just as confused as she is.

18:03.732 --> 18:05.466
Why is everybody determined

18:05.467 --> 18:07.835
- to defy me?
- Because we're

18:07.836 --> 18:09.770
our own people, Grant.
I feel like this is

18:09.771 --> 18:12.234
the first time you haven't been
able to buy whatever you want.

18:12.235 --> 18:14.908
(sighs) I'm just... I'm confused

18:14.909 --> 18:16.010
about Maxine.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.244
She used to...

18:17.245 --> 18:19.413
value my opinion and-and...

18:19.414 --> 18:20.781
seek out my guidance.

18:20.782 --> 18:22.316
Grant,

18:22.317 --> 18:25.119
a person that you can
buy and tell what to do

18:25.120 --> 18:26.787
isn't the same person you respect.

18:26.788 --> 18:28.355
And for the first time in her life,

18:28.356 --> 18:31.325
Maxine realizes she
doesn't just want your money,

18:31.326 --> 18:32.793
she wants your respect.

18:32.794 --> 18:35.663
Okay, okay, I get it.

18:35.664 --> 18:39.233
She's an adult, and she wants
to be seen as an equal.

18:39.234 --> 18:42.536
And one day, if she makes it
on her own two feet, uh...

18:42.537 --> 18:44.305
maybe I can get there.

18:44.306 --> 18:46.307
That's all she's asking for.

18:46.308 --> 18:49.410
Well... I'm really glad we talked.

18:49.411 --> 18:51.312
- Yeah.
- And you know what?

18:51.313 --> 18:54.381
If my daughter <i>has</i> to spend the
rest of her life with somebody,

18:54.382 --> 18:56.617
she could do a lot worse
than you, my friend.

18:56.618 --> 18:59.486
(chuckles): Now, now...
hold on there, Grant.

18:59.487 --> 19:01.555
Uh, Maxine is the one
that needs your respect.

19:01.556 --> 19:04.091
I don't really care what you
think about me. I mean,

19:04.092 --> 19:05.693
we just met, you live out of town,

19:05.694 --> 19:07.317
you're not even coming
to the graduation,

19:07.318 --> 19:09.084
so what's your respect gonna do for me?

19:10.264 --> 19:12.231
Thanks for the check, Grant.

19:13.634 --> 19:16.070
What are you doing here?

19:16.071 --> 19:19.573
Look, Maxine, I came to get
the money from your dad.

19:19.574 --> 19:22.375
I sold my integrity so
you could keep yours.

19:23.210 --> 19:25.178
Oh, thank God.

19:27.934 --> 19:31.264
Maxine, Cynthia and I didn't
want to give you money,

19:31.265 --> 19:33.633
what with how it makes you
go crazy and all, so...

19:33.634 --> 19:35.869
here. (clears throat)

19:35.870 --> 19:38.638
Now, I know you're about
to take that county job,

19:38.639 --> 19:40.540
so we got you some Mace,

19:40.541 --> 19:42.242
a rape whistle,

19:42.243 --> 19:43.943
and some brass knuckles.

19:43.944 --> 19:45.478
- Mm-hmm.
- You know,

19:45.479 --> 19:48.414
they can really deescalate a situation.

19:48.415 --> 19:51.384
Yeah, especially if that
situation happens in 1975.

19:51.385 --> 19:54.154
(laughs) Thank you, Joe.

19:54.155 --> 19:55.755
Here, Maxine. You're gonna like my gift

19:55.756 --> 19:57.423
way better.

19:57.424 --> 20:00.325
It's a half ounce of weed,
but don't weigh it.

20:03.363 --> 20:05.298
Thank you, Nekeisha.

20:05.299 --> 20:07.233
Here, Maxine.

20:07.234 --> 20:09.067
Okay.

20:10.069 --> 20:11.938
"World's Greatest Graduate."

20:11.939 --> 20:13.773
- Oh, thank you, Bobby.
- Because, you know,

20:13.774 --> 20:15.942
you just graduated, so...

20:15.943 --> 20:19.245
And I think you're the greatest...

20:19.246 --> 20:22.215
so I got you a cup that says
"World's Greatest Graduate."

20:22.216 --> 20:23.449
Come on.

20:23.450 --> 20:25.185
Wow.

20:25.186 --> 20:26.486
Well,

20:26.487 --> 20:30.089
having you guys all there
today, and, um, this party...

20:30.090 --> 20:33.059
I've just never had
that kind of support,

20:33.060 --> 20:36.095
and I just...

20:36.096 --> 20:37.931
Shh...

20:37.932 --> 20:39.731
Come on.

20:42.402 --> 20:43.603
Mm...

20:43.604 --> 20:44.971
(chuckles)

20:44.972 --> 20:46.272
Mm.

20:46.273 --> 20:47.973
Done.
