00:04.634 --> 00:06.344
<i>Previously,
on</i> "Billions"...

00:06.430 --> 00:08.968
I get we're in a game
that requires us to win.

00:09.054 --> 00:11.220
I got tired of beating up
on the defenseless.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.351
There are things they were
comfortable with at Axe Cap

00:13.437 --> 00:14.976
that we will never
do here.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.765
You think that I let
the Attorney General

00:16.850 --> 00:19.078
stick his hand up my ass
and run me like a sock puppet.

00:19.164 --> 00:20.600
I'm just glad
I got out of there

00:20.680 --> 00:22.171
before I had to get
caught up in any of that.

00:22.257 --> 00:24.101
Oh, I'm really glad
to see you here tonight,

00:24.203 --> 00:25.773
in that Brioni suit,
which is the mark

00:25.870 --> 00:28.695
of the lawyer who is
successful at everything

00:28.781 --> 00:29.720
that doesn't really matter.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.414
There's no shame
in not being able to hack it

00:31.500 --> 00:33.484
at the highest levels
of the real game,

00:33.570 --> 00:36.570
but the revisionist history,
that's for your wife at home...

00:36.726 --> 00:38.300
not for the man
who fucking knows better.

00:38.500 --> 00:41.804
We put out this fire by
sucking oxygen out of the room.

00:41.906 --> 00:44.054
I'm glad to continue...
To renew...

00:44.140 --> 00:45.796
Axe got to
all of the bankers.

00:45.882 --> 00:48.562
Winston and the quant team have
a huge stat arb opportunity

00:48.648 --> 00:50.050
that I'm gonna have to
leave on the table

00:50.140 --> 00:52.093
if we don't lock in leverage
by end of week.

00:52.179 --> 00:53.773
Mm.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.594
Can I get the box?

00:56.680 --> 00:58.350
This is working for me.

00:58.773 --> 01:00.320
Please?

01:01.665 --> 01:03.304
You once told me
you knew people who...

01:03.390 --> 01:04.414
switched it up.

01:04.500 --> 01:07.424
But that's not Chuck,
not his arousal template.

01:07.510 --> 01:09.914
For him it's not a game.
It's rooted deep.

01:10.159 --> 01:12.101
They are trying to hang you
from the yardarm.

01:12.220 --> 01:13.609
Make them defend
instead of attack.

01:13.710 --> 01:17.800
All I want is vengeance,
and it will be had.

01:17.890 --> 01:19.226
And we all know
what I need to do it.

01:19.312 --> 01:20.492
A perch.

01:20.578 --> 01:24.134
If you try to again put yourself
in a position of public trust,

01:24.220 --> 01:26.898
I will be forced to
let slip the dogs of war.

01:26.992 --> 01:30.930
"I am chomping at the bit to be
your next Attorney General"!

01:31.010 --> 01:33.220
Yes!

02:33.826 --> 02:34.882
Fuck.

02:34.968 --> 02:36.413
We knew Taylor wasn't
gonna leave a key

02:36.499 --> 02:38.452
under the welcome mat.
Who set up their security,

02:38.538 --> 02:39.850
fuckin' George Smiley?

02:39.930 --> 02:42.546
No. Someone else.
I know him by reputation.

02:42.632 --> 02:45.390
He's a good man.
Thorough.

02:45.470 --> 02:48.140
I didn't come
entirely empty handed.

02:48.220 --> 02:50.546
Mason Capital's
remote logins

02:50.632 --> 02:53.858
haven't been given
adequate scrutiny yet.

02:53.944 --> 02:57.424
They will soon, no doubt,
but for now...

02:57.968 --> 03:00.061
It's not what you wanted,

03:00.335 --> 03:03.050
but MaseCap's positions
and trading pattern.

03:03.140 --> 03:04.260
Can we do anything
with that?

03:04.350 --> 03:06.260
We can use size
to soak up the alpha.

03:06.350 --> 03:09.220
It's not a body blow,
maybe not even worth the effort.

03:09.527 --> 03:13.305
No, we can do something
with that.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.220
Unsettle 'em.
Throw 'em off their game.

03:15.300 --> 03:16.680
Buy up
the price on names

03:16.760 --> 03:18.019
they want to increase
their size in.

03:18.105 --> 03:19.222
Costing them upside

03:19.385 --> 03:22.975
and picking tiny little
percentages off their profits.

03:23.488 --> 03:25.058
It'll be like the old
water torture...

03:25.144 --> 03:27.136
Drip, drip, drip.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.180
Like the Japanese
in W.W.II.

03:29.260 --> 03:30.995
Even though the Chinese
invented it...

03:31.128 --> 03:32.433
No they didn't...

03:32.519 --> 03:34.737
Then why is it called
'Chinese Water Torture?'

03:34.823 --> 03:36.680
Taylor will
try to ignore it.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.925
Tell themselves that it's just
a few bips here or there.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.277
- But it won't work.
- Their need for

03:40.363 --> 03:41.542
mathematical perfection

03:41.628 --> 03:42.930
will erode
their well-being.

03:43.010 --> 03:45.026
Then a real mistake
can be induced.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.550
If you ever get tired
of working for him, call me.

03:48.925 --> 03:51.010
Oh, she's not
going anywhere.

03:51.339 --> 03:55.026
She's right, you know.
The Chinese didn't invent it.

03:55.651 --> 03:57.596
Hippolytus de Marsiliis did,

03:57.706 --> 03:59.260
an Italian.

04:03.140 --> 04:04.720
- Morning, Peach.
- Morning.

Big Gulp size.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.050
Excuse me, Axe.

04:26.378 --> 04:28.600
There are other plays
that would yield more upside.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.440
Yeah. We're limiting the upside
for someone else.

04:31.596 --> 04:34.214

What do you know
about the Chicken Man?

05:15.760 --> 05:16.917
What's the thing?

05:17.003 --> 05:20.100
Arkansas Chicken Index.
You know?

05:20.180 --> 05:21.765
Given that Arkansas
is a major chicken producer,

05:21.850 --> 05:24.300
and you getting so geeked
you broke out the Boss for us,

05:24.390 --> 05:26.220
I'm assuming it's an important
fucking index.

05:26.300 --> 05:29.104
It's a market mover.
The numbers dictate the price.

05:29.190 --> 05:30.604
And Chicken Man's the guy
who puts out.

05:30.690 --> 05:32.073
the Arkansas
Chicken Index.

05:32.159 --> 05:33.682
'Zactly.
Latest numbers land today.

05:33.768 --> 05:34.760
We need to be long.

05:34.850 --> 05:36.385
Because there won't
be any chickens?

05:36.471 --> 05:38.760
It's better than that.
There's plenty of chickens.

05:38.850 --> 05:42.100
And the early chicken action
is counting on that.

05:42.268 --> 05:45.612
But Chicken Man will say
that there's very few chickens.

05:45.698 --> 05:47.417
And the price
will skyrocket.

05:47.503 --> 05:48.760
Why will he say that?

05:48.846 --> 05:50.346
'Cause he's supposed
to drag his ass out

05:50.432 --> 05:51.862
to multiple farms
and production houses

05:51.948 --> 05:52.870
to get an accurate count.

05:52.956 --> 05:54.659
But the guy's
Otis of Mayberry.

05:54.776 --> 05:56.050
So he'll
go to one or two,

05:56.136 --> 05:57.393
to make an
appearance, but that's it,

05:57.510 --> 05:59.214
he's not counting shit.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.081
What the guy
does is, he sits there.

06:01.167 --> 06:02.594
on his couch and calls.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.526
a few of
the major poultry producers.

06:04.612 --> 06:06.157
and just asks
them for their numbers.

06:06.350 --> 06:08.350
Yeah, I need to get
a report on the birds.

06:09.460 --> 06:10.799
And they say
their numbers are low

06:10.885 --> 06:12.510
'cause it keeps the prices high.
Right.

06:12.615 --> 06:15.424
It's like a teacher letting
a kid grade his own tests.

06:18.298 --> 06:19.508
If the Chicken Man
is wrong,

06:19.627 --> 06:21.407
why does he get
to stay the Chicken Man?

06:21.493 --> 06:23.953
Because he's wrong in the way
the producers want him to be.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.682
They installed him.
And they keep him in place.

06:26.768 --> 06:28.680
He's a chicken patsy.

06:28.948 --> 06:30.971
I assume you've got
a solid source.

06:39.140 --> 06:42.307
How do you know
the Mobilized Meals gal?

06:43.190 --> 06:45.760
How do you know where
to find mustache wax?

06:46.072 --> 06:48.651
If it's crucial,
you get it done.

06:50.221 --> 06:51.917
What does he eat?

06:52.440 --> 06:55.534
She says he's partial
to chicken.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.042
Bill...

07:01.276 --> 07:02.890
what's your level
of certainty?

07:05.003 --> 07:07.698
I am not uncertain.

07:08.479 --> 07:10.237
Size up the position.

07:10.620 --> 07:12.930
Could mean
a 300 million dollar win.

07:15.440 --> 07:18.307
It's time for Pericles
to stroll the Parthenon.

07:18.471 --> 07:20.229
You smile,
shake some hands.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.764
Like a pol on the hustings.
Which you are.

07:22.850 --> 07:25.100
Make the important people
feel important.

07:25.180 --> 07:26.628
If they were
really important,

07:26.714 --> 07:28.424
they wouldn't need me
to make 'em feel that way.

07:28.674 --> 07:30.344
As Michel Foucault said...

07:30.430 --> 07:32.682
Save that falderal for someone
with nothing better to do

07:32.768 --> 07:35.140
than to parse
your Ivory Tower crap.

07:35.425 --> 07:36.776
Maybe I'll just
stay home.

07:36.862 --> 07:38.550
Son, are you hungover?

07:39.175 --> 07:40.667
Because it's one thing
for a governor

07:40.753 --> 07:42.100
to start his day at 11 a.m.,

07:42.180 --> 07:43.698
but a New York State
Attorney General

07:43.784 --> 07:46.565
needs to be a credible sentinel
on the watchtower.

07:46.651 --> 07:48.050
Not in the bag,

07:48.253 --> 07:50.503
it's a migraine
wearing out its welcome.

07:50.659 --> 07:52.010
Well, walk it off.

07:52.292 --> 07:54.424
The leaders of Local 1199,

07:54.510 --> 07:56.350
the Service Employees
International East,

07:56.495 --> 07:59.100
will be here at my casino
for the opening...

07:59.253 --> 08:00.331
Yours?

08:00.417 --> 08:02.600
My land, so close enough.

08:02.792 --> 08:05.300
Now, these guys represent
400,000 votes.

08:05.581 --> 08:07.640
You've got
some glad-handing to do.

08:07.917 --> 08:08.979
Oh, my God.

08:09.065 --> 08:10.720
I heard that.

08:10.846 --> 08:13.901
Do you think JFK complained
when Ol' Papa Joe

08:13.987 --> 08:15.698
sat him down
with the steel workers?

08:15.784 --> 08:19.140
You're delivering Schenectady,
Dad, not Ohio.

08:19.220 --> 08:22.930
Schenectady is the Ohio
of New York State.

08:23.095 --> 08:24.327
Be here.

08:29.210 --> 08:31.100
Donna, did you get
more Excedrin?

08:31.421 --> 08:33.140
All I got is Tums.

08:33.453 --> 08:34.784
Does that help?

08:37.006 --> 08:39.600
No. It really doesn't.

08:39.756 --> 08:41.482
Can't say I'm sad
about that.

08:41.568 --> 08:43.970
Oh. You're a real
empath, Lonnie.

08:44.049 --> 08:46.350
My empathy
for you died the night

08:46.430 --> 08:48.680
of your hateful soliloquy
at that restaurant.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.850
Sympathy went too considering
you gave it in front of my wife.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.390
Regrettable.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.335
But like all men
of consequence,

08:54.421 --> 08:57.218
we put it aside to move forward
toward our common goal.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.844
Yeah.
We tried to do that.

08:58.930 --> 09:01.140
But the fundraiser is off.

09:01.257 --> 09:03.038
Getting behind me
is good for your firm.

09:03.124 --> 09:04.538
You made them see that.

09:04.624 --> 09:06.220
I rope in donations
from the partners,

09:06.300 --> 09:08.304
you get to flaunt
your political clout.

09:08.429 --> 09:09.991
You don't know there's
a missile coming at you.

09:10.146 --> 09:12.804
I'm the hermit
kingdom right now.

09:12.890 --> 09:15.108
Plenty of armament pointed
at me at all times.

09:15.194 --> 09:16.850
No.
Not pointed.

09:17.116 --> 09:18.559
Launched.

09:19.485 --> 09:22.098
I got called for comment
on an article about you,

09:22.262 --> 09:24.640
about an old case
that you failed to prosecute.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.010
So did my firm's PR rep.
Because of the event.

09:28.309 --> 09:29.880
Which case?

09:30.348 --> 09:32.010
SugarVape.

09:32.348 --> 09:34.489
Flavors designed
to hook kids.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.426
Marketing
to target them.

09:36.512 --> 09:39.223
And a whistleblower
you hung out to dry.

09:39.309 --> 09:41.510
The guy didn't have the goods.
That case couldn't be won.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.005
We would've looked
like schmucks on wheels

09:43.091 --> 09:44.220
if I brought that
to court.

09:44.306 --> 09:46.200
This editor
running the piece

09:46.286 --> 09:48.434
seems to think that
his readers will find

09:48.520 --> 09:51.264
the SugarVape CEO's relationship
with various members

09:51.350 --> 09:54.426
of your father's social group
very titillating.

09:55.946 --> 09:57.559
Fuck.

09:58.905 --> 09:59.844
Which editor?

09:59.930 --> 10:01.450
Lucien Porter.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.458
Don't cancel
the fundraiser.

10:06.890 --> 10:09.778
Oh, I will spike that article.
You know I will.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.067
Why should I?

10:11.153 --> 10:13.275
You finally have
the advantage on me.

10:13.361 --> 10:17.991
You keep this alive,
I actually owe you.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.184
Tell you
what I'll do.

10:23.036 --> 10:24.680
- I'll hold off for now.
- Uh-huh.

10:24.766 --> 10:26.300
But at a certain point,

10:26.390 --> 10:28.390
this is gonna be
out of my hands.

10:28.833 --> 10:30.565
So why don't you

10:30.856 --> 10:32.470
get that Excedrin

10:32.801 --> 10:34.989
and do what
you have to do.

10:50.436 --> 10:51.800
Something
isn't right.

10:51.895 --> 10:53.036
Explain the discrepancy

10:53.122 --> 10:54.800
between realized gains
and expectations.

10:54.890 --> 10:56.522
And don't you
dare blame latency.

10:56.684 --> 10:57.934
Okay...

10:58.020 --> 11:00.304
Transaction costs were
a little higher than we modeled.

11:00.390 --> 11:01.983
There seems to be more
adverse selection

11:02.069 --> 11:04.030
than we anticipated...
Can we just say it?

11:04.116 --> 11:05.350
We're getting
front run somehow.

11:05.430 --> 11:07.694
Obviously.
This is about the how...

11:07.780 --> 11:09.600
Man, I fucking knew it.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.311
There was something unnatural
about the way

11:11.397 --> 11:12.430
we were getting
sawed off.

11:12.523 --> 11:14.532
I even started an email
to let you know.

11:14.618 --> 11:15.964
I'm Cassandra,

11:16.124 --> 11:17.663
always seeing
the future.

11:17.749 --> 11:19.139
You never
sent the email.

11:19.225 --> 11:21.180
The difference between
you and Cassandra is:

11:21.260 --> 11:23.890
She didn't wait until after
the fact to say it aloud.

11:23.976 --> 11:25.475
Pwned like
in the aughts!

11:25.561 --> 11:29.212
It's pronounced "owned."
Which, yes.

11:29.300 --> 11:31.350
I only thought it
but didn't say it.

11:31.592 --> 11:34.155
Doesn't count.
Damnit...

11:34.288 --> 11:36.179
Finish this
at your desks.

11:42.319 --> 11:43.470
You have it?

11:43.550 --> 11:45.225
- Axelrod.
- Yes.

11:45.311 --> 11:46.680
Couldn't have been
a huge money maker for him.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.991
So his objective
wasn't profit.

11:49.077 --> 11:50.260
It was disruption.

11:50.569 --> 11:53.413
Strategy was to get in my head,
make me obsess over it.

11:53.499 --> 11:55.921
And I did,
for a minute.

11:56.140 --> 11:58.491
- Should we involve Grigor?
- No.

11:58.577 --> 12:00.311
Can't seem dependent
on him in that way.

12:00.397 --> 12:02.686
But we do need to seal the
cracks in our infrastructure.

12:02.772 --> 12:04.389
I'll make sure Cook
is on top of it.

12:04.475 --> 12:05.725
Thank you.

12:09.147 --> 12:10.507
Yes?

12:11.171 --> 12:12.577
Send him up.

12:27.538 --> 12:28.702
Nice to see you.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.039
And you.

12:32.975 --> 12:34.569
So.

12:35.038 --> 12:36.561
This is your shop?

12:37.930 --> 12:39.452
This is my shop.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.616
Not much to it,
is there?

12:42.800 --> 12:44.249
Don't places like these
usually spend

12:44.335 --> 12:46.725
buckets of money on nice digs
to impress their clients?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.138
You don't want
to seem gilded.

12:48.224 --> 12:49.961
Highlight
the brain power instead.

12:50.047 --> 12:51.461
Clean. Simple.
Direct.

12:51.547 --> 12:53.187
That's how we make
an impression now.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.976
Simple or not,
it's nice.

12:55.534 --> 12:56.704
It's...

12:56.906 --> 12:57.968
cool.

12:58.054 --> 13:00.430
I guess could be a word.

13:00.633 --> 13:02.970
How about I have my executing
trader give you a tour.

13:03.056 --> 13:04.226
Neat.

13:06.091 --> 13:10.464
Mafee, I'd like you
to meet Douglas Mason.

13:10.550 --> 13:12.220
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Mason.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.300
Yes. This is...

13:17.500 --> 13:19.010
He's my father.

13:19.461 --> 13:20.800
Okay.

13:24.570 --> 13:27.781
There comes a time, Lucien,
when ideology meets reality.

13:27.867 --> 13:30.046
Even in
the newspaper business.

13:30.414 --> 13:33.680
And that's when we Oddfellows
swallow petty grievances

13:33.914 --> 13:36.312
and divine
a productive way forward.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.281
Your theatrical way
of asking me to kill

13:38.367 --> 13:39.570
the SugarVape story?

13:41.351 --> 13:44.100
On a nice afternoon in
your next incarnation,

13:44.289 --> 13:45.760
maybe.

13:46.031 --> 13:49.226
I'm working on a tighter
schedule than that.

13:50.004 --> 13:52.062
"You used to think
that it was so easy,

13:52.148 --> 13:54.437
you used to say
that it was so easy.

13:54.523 --> 13:57.514
But you're trying,
you're trying now."

13:57.898 --> 14:00.172
Doobies?
Doobie Brothers?

14:00.304 --> 14:01.484
Gerry Rafferty.

14:01.570 --> 14:03.289
My first job was writing
record reviews...

14:03.375 --> 14:04.262
You remember stuff.

14:04.348 --> 14:05.750
I'll tell you what else
I remember:

14:05.836 --> 14:08.218
You didn't take me down to
Baker Street when you could've.

14:08.304 --> 14:10.760
If you had, we could come
to an agreeable compromise

14:10.850 --> 14:13.437
now over milkshakes
and handjobs.

14:13.523 --> 14:14.350
But you didn't.

14:14.430 --> 14:16.148
I get that your ass
is chapped, Lucien...

14:16.234 --> 14:17.359
When you were
US Attorney,

14:17.445 --> 14:20.172
you dealt your goods
all over the place.

14:20.258 --> 14:21.510
But not to me.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.961
You wanna go to Baker Street,
baby, we'll go now.

14:24.047 --> 14:25.538
Tell me how
I can serve you.

14:25.624 --> 14:28.742
The reason I came here is:
I want your comment

14:28.851 --> 14:31.344
on the story
I am running.

14:31.500 --> 14:34.720
Why did you bow to pressure
and fail to prosecute?

14:34.953 --> 14:37.187
Who'd you make
the sweetheart deal with?

14:38.883 --> 14:42.445
What do you think happens
when a man resorts to threats

14:42.554 --> 14:44.804
in an effort to solicit
my attention?

14:47.304 --> 14:49.265
What do you think happens
to that man

14:49.351 --> 14:52.050
when I'm seated in
the State AG's office?

14:52.140 --> 14:53.898
That's assuming you win.

14:53.984 --> 14:56.336
And if I were the sort of fella
who liked to throw the dice,

14:56.422 --> 14:57.970
that's not the direction
I'd toss 'em.

14:58.050 --> 15:00.695
You should know,
that's not how dice work.

15:01.470 --> 15:03.760
You're not the only man in
this town with a dick to swing.

15:03.850 --> 15:05.320
- You've got enemies.
- Oh.

15:05.406 --> 15:07.640
I've got a good idea
about who they are.

15:07.914 --> 15:10.773
Who put you up on this nonsense.
I won't say the names.

15:10.867 --> 15:14.720
But I will say: I've found
their help comes cheap.

15:15.031 --> 15:16.914
Hell,
sometimes free.

15:17.050 --> 15:20.656
Oh. You're too old not to know
that what's free is flimsy.

15:20.742 --> 15:23.010
You want this story
to be true so badly

15:23.209 --> 15:25.249
that it's got
you believing in unicorns.

15:25.453 --> 15:28.180
No.
Nothing so exotic as that.

15:28.484 --> 15:30.265
Just corruption.

15:31.351 --> 15:33.515
Yours.
Porter.

15:34.656 --> 15:37.609
"This city desert
makes you feel so cold.

15:37.695 --> 15:41.148
It's got so many people,
but it's got no soul."

15:41.867 --> 15:43.531
Remember that.

15:44.094 --> 15:46.304
I'm offering you a glimpse
of the future:

15:46.538 --> 15:49.383
You publish that piece,

15:49.955 --> 15:51.674
it'll backfire.

16:10.078 --> 16:13.078
First round of pink slime is
on me after this baby comes in.

16:13.164 --> 16:15.320
- That stuff is horrifying.
- I don't mind it.

16:15.406 --> 16:17.195
We can fry it,
with some hot chiles,

16:17.281 --> 16:19.297
or use it as a base
for soup and...

16:19.383 --> 16:21.976
Here it is.

16:25.430 --> 16:27.679
What?

16:28.666 --> 16:30.219
Problems
in Chickenland?

16:30.517 --> 16:32.140
The motherfucking
report's delayed.

16:32.226 --> 16:33.390
Why?

16:34.219 --> 16:35.914
Motherfuck if I know.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.720
I need to get
with Mobilized Meals.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.898
Find out why Chicken Man's
in the vapor.

17:03.195 --> 17:05.258
- Where you going?
- Arkansas.

17:05.430 --> 17:07.031
To fix this.

17:07.936 --> 17:10.099
I looked at the gap
in our cyber defense.

17:10.180 --> 17:13.260
I identified the vulnerability
and stitched it up crudely,

17:13.349 --> 17:15.788
but it's gonna take a day or two
to reliably address the issue.

17:15.930 --> 17:17.577
Make it a day,
not two.

17:17.666 --> 17:19.179
You got it.

17:20.616 --> 17:22.550
Thank you, Cook.

17:23.077 --> 17:24.970
Keep Sara in the loop
on this.

17:25.374 --> 17:27.226
Ran it by her first.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.010
...Just the most considerate kid
you'd ever seen.

17:39.210 --> 17:42.296
No, not considerate like
she did nice things for people.

17:42.413 --> 17:44.720
Considered like
she was always

17:44.800 --> 17:47.577
measuring information
around her.

17:47.765 --> 17:48.850
That sounds about right.

17:49.093 --> 17:50.680
Only now they're considerate
in both ways.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.093
No, no,
she was sweet, too.

17:53.718 --> 17:56.413
When she was real little,
she always told me

17:56.499 --> 17:58.499
that when she grew up
she wanted to marry me.

17:59.890 --> 18:02.101
Now I wonder what I should
have read into that.

18:02.226 --> 18:03.663
Affection.

18:05.851 --> 18:08.359
And that when I was six,
I didn't know that many people.

18:08.616 --> 18:10.335
Well, it was cute, anyway.

18:11.030 --> 18:12.312
I got some work
to do.

18:12.398 --> 18:14.054
Douglas, it was a pleasure
talking with you.

18:14.140 --> 18:16.335
Thank you for
showing me around.

18:17.648 --> 18:19.366
Excluding you,
every person you see

18:19.452 --> 18:21.100
in this office
is under my employ.

18:21.180 --> 18:23.220
They have chosen to work here
because they respect me

18:23.300 --> 18:25.632
and they respect my vision.
They're smart to.

18:25.726 --> 18:28.046
In the future, if you find
yourself in conversation

18:28.132 --> 18:29.429
with one of them,
pay close attention

18:29.515 --> 18:31.577
to the pronouns they use
in reference to me.

18:31.663 --> 18:33.220
This talk again, huh?

18:33.351 --> 18:35.470
You came to see me.
I thought you were ready.

18:35.813 --> 18:38.174
To use your
"preferred pronouns..."

18:38.477 --> 18:40.550
They're the ones used
by those who respect me.

18:40.845 --> 18:42.040
Without the quotes.

18:42.126 --> 18:45.056
I'm sorry, kid.
I'm trying to get there.

18:45.329 --> 18:47.220
I missed ya.
That's why I'm here.

18:49.399 --> 18:51.384
- Yes?
- Can I...?

18:51.470 --> 18:53.680
Speak freely.

18:53.974 --> 18:55.556
I just got
off the phone

18:55.642 --> 18:57.640
with Grigor Andolov's
number two.

18:57.907 --> 19:00.446
He wants to know
"when you're going to start

19:00.532 --> 19:02.134
fucking earning?"

19:04.180 --> 19:05.259
Now.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.550
I just decided to work
on a derivative.

19:09.837 --> 19:11.010
What kind of derivative?

19:11.243 --> 19:13.640
- An homage to Vadim Linetsky.
- Oh.

19:13.790 --> 19:16.555
You're in a 'path integral
methods' sort of mood, are you?

19:16.641 --> 19:18.063
Would you like
to help me?

19:18.149 --> 19:19.640
You bet.

19:27.188 --> 19:28.510
You fucked me.

19:28.860 --> 19:31.970
Closed the damn gate,
left me north of the wall.

19:32.267 --> 19:33.680
I got fired.

19:33.931 --> 19:35.845
- And went bankrupt.
- Yes.

19:35.931 --> 19:37.688
Those things
did happen.

19:37.774 --> 19:40.759
And I feel for you,
for what you've been through.

19:40.845 --> 19:41.899
But them's the breaks?

19:41.985 --> 19:43.510
Well... yes.

19:43.712 --> 19:45.649
You didn't have
the evidence.

19:45.735 --> 19:48.100
All those kids on
the street exhaling

19:48.345 --> 19:50.907
these big ass clouds
of piña colada poison?

19:50.993 --> 19:52.050
They're my evidence.

19:52.140 --> 19:53.829
But you were a whistleblower
without a whistle.

19:53.915 --> 19:56.134
I did the right thing.
You said you'd help.

19:56.360 --> 19:57.850
You brought me on.

19:57.930 --> 20:02.024
And then you yanked the rug
and I ended up on my ass.

20:02.110 --> 20:05.600
And now you're running
for I-don't-know-what-the-fuck,

20:05.680 --> 20:09.087
and I'm living
with my mom.

20:11.260 --> 20:13.300
This is your
mom's house, huh?

20:13.390 --> 20:16.595
And there's like six kids
on this block alone

20:16.681 --> 20:18.688
that I gotta watch sucking
on these SugarVape products

20:18.774 --> 20:19.970
like they're pacifiers.

20:20.050 --> 20:21.876
Would you have preferred
that your mother

20:21.962 --> 20:24.720
lose this place
after she mortgaged it

20:24.923 --> 20:27.602
to help you pay
for the massive civil suit.

20:27.688 --> 20:30.040
SugarVape would have
brought against you?

20:31.300 --> 20:33.602
You didn't think of that,
did you?

20:33.970 --> 20:35.376
I wouldn't let her do that.

20:35.462 --> 20:37.243
They have professionals
on staff

20:37.329 --> 20:40.850
whose only job is:
sell their bullshit.

20:40.930 --> 20:42.600
That's what
corporations do.

20:42.680 --> 20:45.102
If they're willing
to poison kids for profit,

20:45.188 --> 20:46.800
nothing's off
the table.

20:46.890 --> 20:48.470
- Fuck. You're right.
- Yeah.

20:48.550 --> 20:50.470
I shielded you...
And your mother...

20:50.550 --> 20:53.260
From the retribution SugarVape
was prepared to unleash.

20:53.350 --> 20:55.720
But if you let that article run,
they'll sue.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.282
And they'll go after your mom,
because she's got the money...

20:58.368 --> 20:59.350
They'll take her house.

20:59.430 --> 21:01.180
Her furniture.
Her paintings...

21:01.260 --> 21:03.196
And I'm not
in the position

21:03.350 --> 21:04.930
to protect you anymore.

21:11.493 --> 21:13.259
What can I do?

21:15.001 --> 21:16.431
If you want,

21:16.688 --> 21:19.260
I can tell you how
to walk back your statements.

21:29.507 --> 21:30.800
Good news, Lonnie.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.367
I've coaxed the genie
back into his bottle.

21:33.507 --> 21:35.350
Article ain't happening.

21:35.430 --> 21:38.460
So your firm can host
my fundraiser

21:38.546 --> 21:41.376
and we can continue
this little symbiosis of ours.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.945
Another fucking
chicken farm.

22:00.358 --> 22:02.274
Actually
that one's not a farm.

22:02.360 --> 22:06.140
It's a quarantine facility.
Sick birds.

22:06.469 --> 22:07.821
Gross.

22:09.102 --> 22:10.344
Try him again.

22:10.448 --> 22:13.532
I've called him a dozen times.
He's not answering.

22:14.882 --> 22:18.407
Maybe somebody else got to him,
paid him to fuck up the index.

22:26.100 --> 22:28.680
Hall, what do
you have?

22:29.143 --> 22:31.464
Well, they sealed up
the cracks in their system.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.640
We lost
digital access.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.600
We knew they would.
But that was quick, no?

22:35.680 --> 22:39.220
Like I said: I know their guy.
He's got some moves.

22:39.300 --> 22:42.922
Anyway, digital access is gone,
but I have what's left to us.

22:43.008 --> 22:44.477
- What's that?
- A visual.

22:44.563 --> 22:45.672
How?

22:45.758 --> 22:47.640
You have something
on one of their employees?

22:47.914 --> 22:50.470
Taylor would be able to root
out a guilty conscience.

22:50.550 --> 22:52.640
Most people who want
privacy in this city

22:52.720 --> 22:54.430
have privacy glass.

22:54.510 --> 22:56.618
If they don't, they have
their windows treated.

22:56.828 --> 22:58.977
That is privacy glass.
Of course it is.

22:59.063 --> 23:01.110
You're telling me Taylor
doesn't have privacy glass?

23:01.196 --> 23:02.282
They do.

23:02.368 --> 23:03.766
But I have this...

23:08.828 --> 23:10.289
It's Israeli.

23:10.891 --> 23:13.050
It uses a spatial
light modulator,

23:13.140 --> 23:14.640
and that allows me
to take pictures

23:14.720 --> 23:16.720
that people don't
want me to take.

23:16.901 --> 23:18.134
Very handy.

23:18.250 --> 23:20.470
The Israelis
do not fuck around

23:20.550 --> 23:22.680
when it comes
to their spy equipment.

23:22.938 --> 23:24.657
But why is it
in your hands

23:24.743 --> 23:26.430
instead of set up
taking goddamned pictures.

23:26.510 --> 23:29.828
Oh, it is.
This one's for personal use.

23:45.048 --> 23:47.438
Don't you love the notation
for bolding?

23:47.618 --> 23:48.657
The double stem?

23:48.743 --> 23:50.140
Yes. I do.

23:50.446 --> 23:52.760
Finding a satisfying answer
is a good thing.

23:53.032 --> 23:55.664
Probably why you and I were
always at our best

23:55.750 --> 23:57.760
when we kept things
mathematical.

23:57.846 --> 24:00.418
Sure. But even when one
keeps things mathematical,

24:00.508 --> 24:02.800
a satisfying solution
isn't always available.

24:02.890 --> 24:04.930
So you change
the math.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.891
Human beings can't
command math.

24:06.977 --> 24:10.532
You can't bend it to your will.
It doesn't exist to satisfy you.

24:11.914 --> 24:13.727
This is an example.

24:14.125 --> 24:16.100
Linetsky knew if he were
to create a derivative,

24:16.180 --> 24:18.600
it would develop organically
in a way he couldn't control.

24:18.860 --> 24:21.157
His only options were
to learn to understand

24:21.243 --> 24:23.680
and accept where it was
taking him, or step away.

24:23.961 --> 24:26.149
He had to be able
to live with that.

24:26.781 --> 24:28.303
Yeah.

24:28.618 --> 24:31.414
We're all trying
to understand and accept.

24:47.274 --> 24:48.970
Casa de Chicken?

24:49.219 --> 24:50.390
This is it.

25:34.680 --> 25:37.298
I told you
he wasn't around.

26:06.767 --> 26:08.087
Oh fuck...

26:08.300 --> 26:10.173
He's fucking dead?

26:10.510 --> 26:12.986
Most people don't
nap in that position, so yeah.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.548
Dead seems like
a real safe bet.

26:14.634 --> 26:15.986
Get out of there.

26:16.072 --> 26:17.890
Figure out who's gonna
take his place.

26:18.048 --> 26:20.760
and find a way to motivate
that person in our direction.

26:20.850 --> 26:23.525
Otherwise your chicken business
will consist of you asking:

26:23.611 --> 26:25.939
you want original recipe
or extra fucking crispy?

26:26.109 --> 26:27.486
On top of it...

26:30.140 --> 26:31.890
Chicken Man is dead.

26:32.230 --> 26:34.822
And so is our position
unless Bill can figure out

26:34.908 --> 26:36.259
a way to defibrillate it...

26:38.642 --> 26:40.431
Anything on tap?

26:40.800 --> 26:42.260
Order in.
School night.

26:42.350 --> 26:44.760
- Yeah. Me too...
- You!

26:47.542 --> 26:49.876
- Fuck you, Connerty.
- What am I missing?

26:49.962 --> 26:51.853
Your boss here fed me
a bogus story.

26:52.009 --> 26:53.392
What? No I didn't.

26:53.478 --> 26:55.204
Ray Cruz just
rescinded his offer

26:55.290 --> 26:57.180
to go on record
for the article.

26:57.260 --> 26:59.103
Now why would he do that
if the whole story

26:59.189 --> 27:00.673
wasn't bullshit
from the start?

27:00.829 --> 27:02.572
I'm not sure,
but the story's not bullshit.

27:02.658 --> 27:04.028
You know, Chuck Rhoades
tried to warn me

27:04.114 --> 27:05.494
you were
smoke screening me.

27:05.760 --> 27:06.720
I should have listened to him,
but I...

27:06.800 --> 27:09.600
Uh. Excuse me.
Hi. I'm Kate Sacker.

27:10.281 --> 27:12.100
- Lucien Porter, editor of...
- I know who you are.

27:12.351 --> 27:13.720
And I know
the SugarVape case well.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.800
I have no idea
what Chuck told you about it,

27:15.890 --> 27:17.470
but I do know
that he's motivated to lie

27:17.550 --> 27:19.254
for his own benefit
on this one.

27:19.348 --> 27:20.918
Doesn't matter.

27:21.482 --> 27:23.562
Cruz isn't going
on record anymore.

27:23.648 --> 27:25.738
I've got a big chunk
of empty column space.

27:25.824 --> 27:27.918
And you've been
a fat waste of time.

27:28.020 --> 27:29.600
Start thinking
of a make-up call.

27:29.680 --> 27:30.930
It's the least
of what I'm owed.

27:31.010 --> 27:32.777
Listen, whatever Chuck
pulled with Cruz,

27:32.863 --> 27:34.949
I will undo tomorrow.

27:35.180 --> 27:37.973
I will do this because I can,
and because I'm generous...

27:38.067 --> 27:39.363
Which you will see
in the near future.

27:39.449 --> 27:40.779
In return,
give us a day.

27:41.010 --> 27:42.600
And when Cruz corroborates,
you'll be able to

27:42.686 --> 27:45.010
run your story as planned.

27:52.615 --> 27:54.445
Mmm.

27:56.390 --> 27:59.140
You could not get uni
like this back home.

27:59.220 --> 28:01.930
Back home is hundreds of miles
from any body of water.

28:02.010 --> 28:03.390
Yeah. But you know
it's all frozen

28:03.470 --> 28:04.800
on the boat and flown in,
anyways.

28:04.890 --> 28:06.380
- Right?
- I'm aware.

28:06.466 --> 28:07.833
But the best stuff
gets bought up

28:07.919 --> 28:09.167
at the New York
fish market

28:09.253 --> 28:10.884
before the rest of it
gets loaded onto the plane

28:10.970 --> 28:12.481
for the short hop flight.

28:20.153 --> 28:21.903
Thing of beauty,
isn't it?

28:21.989 --> 28:23.930
All written out
like this.

28:24.755 --> 28:26.200
It is.

28:30.161 --> 28:31.600
Hey kid.

28:31.833 --> 28:33.380
You know
I don't think that

28:33.466 --> 28:35.966
'woke' stuff is all worthless
or for idiots

28:36.052 --> 28:37.692
just because
I'm no good at it.

28:37.778 --> 28:38.974
Right?

28:40.286 --> 28:41.849
I know it matters.

28:43.028 --> 28:44.239
Right.

29:04.044 --> 29:06.224
Do I need
a girlfriend?

29:07.419 --> 29:08.770
Do you?

29:09.599 --> 29:12.684
Suddenly have a craving
for antiquing

29:12.770 --> 29:15.800
and long walks
in the Hamptons?

29:16.067 --> 29:18.263
Post-brunch reach-arounds
anyway...

29:22.945 --> 29:24.115
Got something for you.

29:24.372 --> 29:26.050
It's a giant
Reggie Bar, right?

29:26.140 --> 29:27.220
Better.

29:27.393 --> 29:28.824
Let's see it.

29:37.474 --> 29:38.764
You lied.

29:38.850 --> 29:39.770
It's not better
than a Reggie Bar.

29:39.856 --> 29:40.848
There's no nougat.

29:40.934 --> 29:43.050
Reggie Bar didn't have
nougat either.

29:43.403 --> 29:47.098
But it was a thing of beauty.
Like this.

29:50.008 --> 29:52.169
This is the can opener
in the fallout shelter.

29:52.255 --> 29:53.640
Nicely done.

29:53.950 --> 29:56.005
My pleasure.
Enjoy.

30:00.122 --> 30:01.680
Wiki me up to speed.

30:01.888 --> 30:04.122
Taylor knows I'm front-running
their positions.

30:04.208 --> 30:05.720
They figured it out.

30:05.800 --> 30:09.140
This is their solution to that,
how they're gonna spin it

30:09.220 --> 30:12.430
to pick up the basis points
that we were stealing.

30:12.510 --> 30:13.850
Obvious.

30:13.930 --> 30:16.300
So obvious...

30:27.390 --> 30:29.600
You don't need to come
to the casino thing.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.138
If you're not up for it,
I mean.

30:31.224 --> 30:32.630
Of course I do.

30:32.716 --> 30:34.013
I thought killing
that article

30:34.099 --> 30:35.349
would have cured
this migraine.

30:35.435 --> 30:36.489
They're tension
headaches.

30:40.390 --> 30:41.864
Well, there is
one practice

30:41.950 --> 30:44.716
I've found helpful
in tension relief...

30:52.902 --> 30:55.888
I'm not a dispensary
handing out palliative care.

30:57.930 --> 31:01.220
But if you're in the mood
for something mutual,

31:01.474 --> 31:04.075
I can go make sure
the kids are asleep.

31:04.769 --> 31:07.184
I've literally got
the proverbial...

31:07.270 --> 31:08.747
Headache.

31:09.552 --> 31:10.720
Sure.

31:14.552 --> 31:15.600
Really, Wend.

31:15.680 --> 31:17.100
I don't want to drag you
up there with me if it's...

31:17.180 --> 31:18.731
You can pretend
you're not a politician,

31:18.840 --> 31:20.364
and I can pretend
I'm not a politician's wife.

31:20.450 --> 31:23.598
But we agreed getting you back
to being a prosecutor,

31:23.684 --> 31:25.260
it's your calling.

31:25.599 --> 31:29.020
So that's where we are
right now. And what we are.

31:30.122 --> 31:31.344
You're right.

31:31.544 --> 31:32.970
I know, you're right.

31:33.050 --> 31:34.302
And you still have
those headaches...

31:34.388 --> 31:36.645
because, article or not,

31:36.731 --> 31:38.430
Jock and Connerty
are still coming after you.

31:38.510 --> 31:39.760
Right about that too.

31:39.850 --> 31:41.760
Just not sure what to do
about it yet.

31:42.850 --> 31:45.140
Ow.

32:36.970 --> 32:38.800
We got
six more stops.

32:38.890 --> 32:41.220
Let's get a good, quick count,
and we'll be on the road.

32:41.300 --> 32:44.890
Ah, shit.

32:53.825 --> 32:55.473
They've sent
in the flying squad.

32:55.559 --> 32:56.927
There's fucking
seven of them.

32:57.013 --> 33:00.098
Well, then you got six more guys
to deal with than anticipated.

33:00.184 --> 33:02.079
What are the chances
they can all be bought?

33:02.165 --> 33:03.255
It doesn't look good.

33:03.341 --> 33:04.833
Arnold Rothstein bought
the White Sox,

33:04.919 --> 33:06.169
including Shoeless Joe.

33:06.255 --> 33:07.724
Get it done.

33:08.966 --> 33:10.513
All nighter?

33:12.095 --> 33:14.263
I always forget
you can do the math.

33:14.349 --> 33:15.895
What can't I do?

33:16.380 --> 33:17.434
Field surgery?

33:17.520 --> 33:19.528
Keep talking,
we'll find out.

33:23.053 --> 33:26.364
If you don't mind my asking,
why the cold feet?

33:27.302 --> 33:29.304
Man who hangs kitten-Jesus
in his living room

33:29.390 --> 33:30.760
doesn't usually
get cold feet.

33:30.850 --> 33:32.850
It's my ma's.
I'm an atheist.

33:33.114 --> 33:34.430
Sure.

33:34.669 --> 33:36.350
- Well.
- It's not cold feet.

33:36.430 --> 33:39.550
I just...
I can't risk what I got left.

33:39.747 --> 33:41.770
And I definitely don't want
to put my ma in danger.

33:41.856 --> 33:43.305
Yeah. I know it's been
a hard ride for you.

33:43.390 --> 33:45.513
But it's not
an outrageous question.

33:46.260 --> 33:48.013
Right when you have a chance
to get some steam

33:48.099 --> 33:49.583
behind your case
with this article,

33:49.669 --> 33:53.333
right when you almost have
the justice that you deserve,

33:53.419 --> 33:56.260
publicly,
you back out.

33:56.350 --> 33:57.720
I just want to know why.

33:57.841 --> 33:59.260
I really appreciate
you looking out

33:59.350 --> 34:00.919
for the little guy in the ring,
and that you think

34:01.005 --> 34:03.955
it's the right thing to do
to stand in his corner.

34:04.505 --> 34:05.890
But it isn't.

34:06.184 --> 34:07.484
No.

34:07.603 --> 34:10.594
The right thing is to get
his ass out of the ring

34:10.679 --> 34:12.219
so he's not
taking punches.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.389
No, the right thing to do
is to get Triple G

34:14.469 --> 34:17.871
to go in the ring for him
and fuck the other guy up.

34:18.574 --> 34:20.036
So come on.

34:21.219 --> 34:23.849
I'm the Triple G
of the Southern District.

34:24.802 --> 34:26.510
Lemme get in the ring
for you.

34:26.708 --> 34:29.536
And I'm sure you are.
But no thanks.

34:29.880 --> 34:33.300
At the end of the day,
I just don't wanna get sued.

34:33.434 --> 34:35.889
Mm. So that's
what you think.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.800
Yeah.

34:38.059 --> 34:40.434
Well, I have an idea
who told you that.

34:41.606 --> 34:43.760
But Chuck Rhoades
lied to you.

34:43.996 --> 34:45.809
He said
you'd say that.

34:46.050 --> 34:48.677
Did he also remember to tell you
about your payout?

34:50.004 --> 34:52.596
SugarVape's not gonna sue you.
Or your mother.

34:53.050 --> 34:56.393
You're going to sue them.
And you're gonna score.

34:57.307 --> 34:58.550
Wait, what?

34:58.792 --> 35:00.390
- I am?
- That's right.

35:00.589 --> 35:02.800
Because I'm going
to prosecute SugarVape myself,

35:02.890 --> 35:05.807
and even though I cannot
promise a conviction,

35:06.440 --> 35:09.018
I can promise that
I will make damn sure

35:09.104 --> 35:11.503
to bring out all the facts
that'll allow you to qualify

35:11.589 --> 35:13.640
as a federal
whistleblower.

35:13.971 --> 35:16.518
And get paid.

35:17.556 --> 35:19.049
Big time.

35:22.878 --> 35:24.930
Your guest room
is comfortable.

35:25.190 --> 35:26.350
Flatscreen in there...

35:26.430 --> 35:27.485
4K?

35:27.571 --> 35:28.815
Five.

35:31.932 --> 35:33.979
You know,
you make me proud.

35:35.323 --> 35:37.682
My little girl
did well for herself.

35:38.503 --> 35:40.018
I'm sorry.

35:40.350 --> 35:42.260
To me, you're still
my little girl.

35:42.714 --> 35:44.167
No, I'm not.

35:44.253 --> 35:45.600
You were once.

35:45.768 --> 35:47.346
Not really.

35:47.971 --> 35:49.470
Well, I'm proud.

35:49.753 --> 35:52.229
You challenge yourself.
Even more than I do.

35:53.010 --> 35:54.229
See?

35:54.454 --> 35:56.874
You put the spoon on the bottom;
it's harder than the fork.

35:57.315 --> 35:58.680
Only one point of contact
with the surface

35:58.760 --> 36:00.729
as opposed
to a full line.

36:01.828 --> 36:03.159
Harder.

36:07.549 --> 36:08.978
You win.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.550
You know
you get it from me.

36:10.940 --> 36:12.300
Define "it."

36:12.635 --> 36:14.956
That unyielding compulsion
to get it right.

36:15.057 --> 36:16.760
Precision.
Perfection.

36:17.143 --> 36:18.714
Just like me.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.050
If you want, you can stick
around for a few more days.

36:22.140 --> 36:23.379
Yeah?

36:23.483 --> 36:25.230
Your mother won't miss me
getting in her way

36:25.316 --> 36:27.168
back home
for a little while longer.

36:27.521 --> 36:29.472
Of course, I'll have to eat
the cost of the flight home,

36:29.558 --> 36:31.440
but it's worth it.
I'll pay for it.

36:31.526 --> 36:32.866
I wasn't...

36:37.230 --> 36:38.550
All this?

36:38.902 --> 36:40.480
I could have done it.

36:41.550 --> 36:43.265
But they didn't even have
hedge funds back then.

36:43.350 --> 36:45.890
Not that I'd heard of.
So I went aerospace.

36:45.970 --> 36:47.640
Figured I'd build
something...

36:50.100 --> 36:51.890
I wish I'd been able
to give it all to you,

36:51.970 --> 36:53.547
is what I'm saying.

36:54.937 --> 36:56.109
Ah.

36:56.523 --> 36:58.745
Don't listen to me, kid.
Just rambling.

36:58.831 --> 36:59.961
Okay.

37:00.047 --> 37:01.539
I won't.

37:02.937 --> 37:03.969
Well.

37:04.078 --> 37:06.148
I'm glad we'll have
more time together.

37:06.234 --> 37:07.570
I am too.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.430
I'm glad
you're happy.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.765
I hate to interrupt you
while you're on the verge

37:23.850 --> 37:25.890
of solving pi,

37:26.133 --> 37:28.969
but they're about to put out
a new count on the bird surplus.

37:31.227 --> 37:32.850
Shit...
Shit...

37:33.062 --> 37:35.890
Number's high.
We're out of position.

37:36.109 --> 37:37.820
Costing us plenty.

37:41.797 --> 37:44.297
Fuckin' Bill.
Bill!

37:44.469 --> 37:47.220
I got a solution
to our chicken problem...

37:47.617 --> 37:49.852
A final solution.

37:51.008 --> 37:52.470
Bill?!

37:55.078 --> 37:56.359
Did he just say...?

37:56.445 --> 37:59.734
Oh shit,
it's a chicken holocaust.

38:46.854 --> 38:48.054
Shit.

38:56.992 --> 38:58.260
Fuck!

39:19.359 --> 39:20.970
I guess you can hear the bells
ringing for the departed

39:21.050 --> 39:22.720
from all the way Upstate.

39:22.922 --> 39:25.470
Son, did you actually
prosecute anyone

39:25.550 --> 39:27.680
when you were
US Attorney?

39:27.977 --> 39:29.720
I'm skipping
the casino.

39:29.883 --> 39:32.300
Damage control is best performed
without an audience.

39:32.390 --> 39:35.523
And yes, by the way, thousands.
Most successfully.

39:35.609 --> 39:37.010
So you say.

39:37.100 --> 39:39.094
And absolutely not
on skipping this event.

39:39.180 --> 39:40.820
It's more important
than ever that you show up.

39:40.906 --> 39:42.211
We both know
your fundraiser's.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.273
gonna be canceled,
if it hasn't been already.

39:44.359 --> 39:47.641
You hide in shame now
and people will wonder

39:47.727 --> 39:49.461
what other weaknesses
and depravities

39:49.547 --> 39:50.720
there are to discover.

39:50.800 --> 39:53.300
You'll get up here,
wear a nice suit,

39:53.508 --> 39:55.820
put your arm around
that pretty wife,

39:55.906 --> 39:59.750
smile big
and face the people.

what are you about to do
right now?

40:51.523 --> 40:54.523
What's in the bag, Bill,

40:54.797 --> 40:58.242
A capon with a case

41:11.414 --> 41:12.516
That's a good point.
Right, so...

41:12.602 --> 41:14.601
But there is
a cost-benefit analysis

41:14.687 --> 41:16.125
to take into
consideration here...

41:16.211 --> 41:18.555
That of poisoning
the food supply.

41:18.641 --> 41:20.773
One I am familiar with.
As you know.

41:20.859 --> 41:23.180
One that requires
meticulous calibration.

41:23.260 --> 41:25.008
Or else we're all

41:25.094 --> 41:26.430
Gwyneth Paltrow

41:31.641 --> 41:33.391

be a huge loss.

41:33.477 --> 41:36.100

- It's okay.

41:36.180 --> 41:38.102
It's not okay!

41:38.523 --> 41:40.117

41:40.203 --> 41:41.930

I don't want to be

47:11.594 --> 47:13.094
Yeah.

47:13.260 --> 47:15.016
I got that you were
proposing armistice

47:15.102 --> 47:16.930
the second I looked
at the algorithm.

47:17.164 --> 47:20.266
But you should have considered
the joys of peace

47:20.352 --> 47:22.680
before you assassinated
the Archduke.

47:22.937 --> 47:25.180
It's a distraction.
To me, and to you.

47:25.445 --> 47:28.531
It prevents us both from
operating at our full potential.

47:29.117 --> 47:30.789
Oh. So you'd like to
calm the blood feud

47:30.875 --> 47:32.640
for the sake
of self-actualization?

47:32.898 --> 47:35.359
I'd like to end it because
it's the rational thing to do.

47:35.445 --> 47:37.570
That's convenient,
that you can fall back

47:37.656 --> 47:39.195
on what's rational
just 'cause you don't like

47:39.281 --> 47:40.600
the consequences
of your actions.

47:40.680 --> 47:41.969
Bullshit.

47:42.929 --> 47:44.500
You're frustrated.

47:45.050 --> 47:46.461
Good.

47:46.719 --> 47:47.970
It's gonna get worse.

47:48.125 --> 47:49.836
You're not
seeing the board:

47:50.010 --> 47:51.617
You walked into a trap
with Grigor.

47:51.703 --> 47:53.719
You bought into
a worthless robotics company

47:53.805 --> 47:55.350
to deny me leverage,
which I got anyway.

47:55.609 --> 47:57.850
And now you've killed a day
going through a numbers game.

47:58.352 --> 48:00.742
And here you are.
And here you are.

48:00.828 --> 48:03.100
Unable to operate
unencumbered.

48:03.180 --> 48:05.100
Waiting for
the next attack.

48:05.320 --> 48:07.008
Wondering where
it's gonna come from.

48:07.109 --> 48:08.510
Yes.
Sure.

48:08.703 --> 48:11.078
But you aren't able
to operate freely either.

48:11.260 --> 48:13.930
You're planning attacks.
Then defending from a response.

48:14.211 --> 48:15.300
Let's stop.

48:15.390 --> 48:17.000
Not waste ourselves
on each other.

48:17.086 --> 48:19.633
Our time and energy
are too valuable.

48:21.312 --> 48:22.945
Is that all?

48:24.705 --> 48:27.422
I'll offer you attractive terms
to invest in my firm.

48:27.508 --> 48:29.164
The Street will know
that I am blessed by you,

48:29.250 --> 48:31.414
but also,
that I am giving you a look.

48:33.367 --> 48:35.640
In reality, I won't be
giving you that look...

48:35.774 --> 48:37.453
And since I sealed our leaks
you won't be getting them

48:37.539 --> 48:38.930
on your own either.

48:39.010 --> 48:40.578
But the story will be enough
for it to appear

48:40.664 --> 48:42.328
that you are
in the dominant position.

48:46.289 --> 48:47.703
Okay.

48:48.398 --> 48:49.562
Fine.

48:50.142 --> 48:51.969
Can I trust you
on this?

48:52.300 --> 48:55.211
You're the fucking genius,
figure it out.

49:08.500 --> 49:10.430
Did you agree
to a truce?

49:12.336 --> 49:14.050
Did they buy it?

49:14.312 --> 49:16.172
Well.
They're a trusting person.

49:16.258 --> 49:18.086
So we'll see.

49:19.125 --> 49:20.984
Time to set up
the next part.

49:27.760 --> 49:31.680
<i>♪ Steel bars

49:31.760 --> 49:36.430

49:43.720 --> 49:44.720

49:51.140 --> 49:54.720
Thank you so much!
Thank you!

49:54.800 --> 49:57.430
It's incredible.

49:57.510 --> 49:58.850
He's never stopped.

49:58.930 --> 50:00.350
He's never let
his audience down.

50:00.430 --> 50:02.510
Never quit on them.
Yeah.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.578
And they never quit
on him, either.

50:04.850 --> 50:07.234
Some are built
that way.

50:07.844 --> 50:09.470
The rest of them quit

50:09.550 --> 50:11.672
or die...

50:13.042 --> 50:15.758
That's the way
a legend oughta be.

50:15.970 --> 50:18.477
That's the way
a legend oughta be.

50:19.562 --> 50:21.140
I'll never quit.

50:24.259 --> 50:25.805
I'll never die.

50:32.906 --> 50:34.141
Head still
pounding, huh?

50:34.227 --> 50:35.397
Yeah.

50:38.260 --> 50:41.055
Don't worry about
all these motherfuckers, my boy.

50:41.141 --> 50:43.470
Just stay standing.

50:44.172 --> 50:47.180
Longer than the next guy.
And the guy after that.

50:47.260 --> 50:51.930
Do whatever you need to do
to outlast him.

50:52.469 --> 50:55.445
If he loses,

50:56.133 --> 50:58.453
you win, son.

51:07.640 --> 51:09.600
Please
welcome back

51:09.828 --> 51:11.720
Michael Bolton!

51:18.266 --> 51:20.720
The difference
between us, Bob...

51:20.969 --> 51:23.300
One of the many...is:

51:23.617 --> 51:25.992
I've spent the last
8 or so years

51:26.078 --> 51:27.961
putting people in jail.

51:28.937 --> 51:31.466
You've spent them making people
unbelievably wealthy.

51:31.656 --> 51:33.841
Mm. My way tends
to gather more friends.

51:33.927 --> 51:35.623
That it does.

51:36.044 --> 51:39.060
And yet,
here we are.

51:39.531 --> 51:40.896
Friends.

51:41.750 --> 51:43.037
Of a sort.

51:52.970 --> 51:55.763
Oh, I have traded pleasantries
and handshakes

51:55.849 --> 51:58.380
with some truly
disagreeable people.

51:59.576 --> 52:02.599
And whatever it says about me
as a person, I'll admit,

52:03.044 --> 52:04.800
I'm willing to do it

52:04.890 --> 52:07.904
with a million more of them
to achieve my ends.

52:08.177 --> 52:10.333
Willingness to fraternize
with the depraved...

52:10.419 --> 52:11.550
Powerful weapon.
Oh.

52:11.640 --> 52:13.680
You have to be willing.
Yeah.

52:13.826 --> 52:15.470
'Cause someone else out there
certainly is.

52:15.550 --> 52:16.841
Mm.

52:17.490 --> 52:19.466
It's not enough
this time though.

52:19.640 --> 52:22.395
I'm not going to win
this election by that alone.

52:23.680 --> 52:26.220
No?
No.

52:33.567 --> 52:36.100
I need your assistance
on this one.

52:38.559 --> 52:40.286
Starting with the primary.

52:40.510 --> 52:44.350
And I don't just mean money.
Though I also mean money...

52:44.637 --> 52:46.600
- That's a big ask.
- Well.

52:46.809 --> 52:49.680
The only way I take office
is if I outlast the other guy.

52:49.760 --> 52:51.970
And right now he's got
plenty in the tank

52:52.050 --> 52:53.510
to get him
to the finish line.

52:53.596 --> 52:56.340
I need you to help me
drain him of that.

52:57.567 --> 52:59.059
You want me
to help put you

52:59.145 --> 53:00.731
in the State Attorney
General's office.

53:00.817 --> 53:02.176
I do.

53:02.262 --> 53:05.762
Last time you were a lawman,
it wasn't so good for me.

53:06.153 --> 53:08.075
This time
it'll be different.

53:08.629 --> 53:12.028
You sure about that?
I've seen a lot of Westerns.

53:12.114 --> 53:14.100
A man changes when
he puts on that star.

53:14.278 --> 53:17.481
No sir.
Not on the inside.

53:18.350 --> 53:21.161
I wear the badge,
I'll be able to do for you.

53:21.247 --> 53:23.192
Favors reap favors.

53:24.051 --> 53:26.325
And I'm sure
there's a favor or two

53:26.411 --> 53:27.801
I could help you with.

53:42.840 --> 53:44.510
I have something
in mind, yeah.

53:44.731 --> 53:46.036
Name it.

53:46.300 --> 53:48.890
I'll do that on
the other side of the war.

53:51.050 --> 53:52.390
Thank you.
