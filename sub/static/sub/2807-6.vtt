WEBVTT

00:03.420 --> 00:05.295
- Hey, guys, guess what.
- What?

00:05.463 --> 00:08.674
I know it's last minute, but we've
decided to have a Halloween party.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.009
- Oh, good!
- Great!

00:10.176 --> 00:12.636
- And everybody has to wear costumes.
- Oh, I don't know...

00:14.556 --> 00:16.347
Come on, it'll be fun.

00:16.516 --> 00:21.562
Uh, I'll be there. I have to wear a
costume to my classes that day anyway.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.522
Tell me you're not gonna dress
like a dinosaur.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.441
Pfft, heh.

00:25.608 --> 00:27.359
Not two years in a row.

00:29.904 --> 00:32.781
- I'll come, but I'm not dressing up.
- You have to.

00:32.949 --> 00:38.746
No. Halloween is stupid. Dressing up,
pretending to be someone you're not.

00:38.913 --> 00:40.706
You're an actor.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.959
Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?

00:44.127 --> 00:47.046
- Yeah. Yeah, I will.
- The girl from their wedding?

00:47.213 --> 00:48.464
- Yeah.
- Wow, hey.

00:48.631 --> 00:52.718
If she needs any ideas for costumes,
she could be a, uh, bikini model...

00:52.886 --> 00:55.596
...or a slutty nurse,
or a sexy cheerleader.

00:55.764 --> 00:59.016
Or, ooh, ooh. Leatherface
from Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.686
No, no, no! Slutty Leatherface.

01:03.646 --> 01:06.982
Wasn't Joey hitting on her
at the wedding too?

01:07.192 --> 01:10.194
That's right, he was hitting on her.

01:10.361 --> 01:15.115
And I got her. I guess
the better man won. Heh.

01:15.283 --> 01:18.077
Please don't take her from me.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.830
- Ursula!
- Oh. Heh.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.582
Wait. It's me, Phoebe.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.502
Oh, I thought there was a mirror there.
Okay. Bye.

02:09.211 --> 02:10.628
Wait a second!

02:10.797 --> 02:12.923
Um, so, what's new with you?

02:13.091 --> 02:16.844
Um, nothing. I mean,
I'm getting married next week.

02:17.011 --> 02:18.762
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

02:18.930 --> 02:22.057
It's gonna be a small ceremony.
Just family.

02:22.225 --> 02:23.517
His.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.185
Huh.

02:25.353 --> 02:26.687
Okay.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.522
I'm really happy for you.

02:29.023 --> 02:33.735
Wait. If, um... If you want to come,
I guess that'd be okay.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.529
- Really?
- Sure, why not?

02:35.697 --> 02:37.990
You could be my "sister" for the day.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.868
Yeah, heh, okay.

02:41.035 --> 02:43.745
Um, you know, my friends are having
a Halloween party tonight...

02:43.913 --> 02:46.415
...at my old apartment,
so you could come.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.834
Maybe I could meet the guy
you're marrying.

02:49.002 --> 02:52.087
Well, I'm supposed
to be working tonight.

02:52.255 --> 02:55.340
I'm supposed to be working now,
so who cares!

02:56.009 --> 03:00.345
- By the way, it's a costume party.
- Oh, okay, so that's why you're...

03:01.139 --> 03:02.764
No.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.850
But thanks.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.358
- Hi.
- You're supposed to wear a costume.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.569
I am. I am a woman...

03:15.737 --> 03:18.780
...who spent a lot of money on a dress
and she wants to wear it...

03:18.948 --> 03:21.825
...because soon
she won't be able to fit into it.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.911
- Oh. I'm Catwoman.
- Ah.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.288
Who wants the dress
when you're too big for it.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.789
Okay.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.335
- Trick or treat!
- Oh! Can I give out candy?

03:31.502 --> 03:33.045
I really want to be with kids.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.465
Ever since I got pregnant,
I have the strongest maternal instincts.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.635
- Trick or treat!
- Just a minute!

03:44.599 --> 03:47.476
We... Aah! Look at you guys!

03:47.644 --> 03:52.481
- Wow! You are a very scary witch.
- Thank you.

03:52.649 --> 03:56.360
- And you are a very funny clown.
- Thank you.

03:56.527 --> 03:57.903
And you...

03:58.071 --> 04:00.280
...are so in style right now.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.408
You know, I work at Ralph Lauren.

04:03.576 --> 04:07.412
The whole fall line has got
this equestrian theme going on.

04:07.580 --> 04:11.208
- Did you see the cover of Vogue...?
- Could I just have the candy?

04:13.670 --> 04:16.213
Yeah. Sure.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.807
Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.

04:28.184 --> 04:30.060
So we do, Supergirl.

04:30.812 --> 04:33.230
It's me, Phoebe.

04:35.149 --> 04:38.235
Monica, can I talk to you
for a second?

04:43.908 --> 04:46.076
Listen, I appreciate
you getting the costume.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.494
Oh, you did this to him?

04:48.579 --> 04:50.539
What? I thought he'd love it.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.791
His favorite book
was The Velveteen Rabbit.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.419
The Velveteen Rabbit
was brown and white.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.339
It was either a pink bunny,
or no bunny at all.

04:59.507 --> 05:02.134
No bunny at all.
Always no bunny at all!

05:04.762 --> 05:07.097
- Hey.
- You didn't dress up either?

05:07.265 --> 05:09.975
Yes, I did. I'm Chandler.

05:15.064 --> 05:16.648
Dude, what happened?

05:17.775 --> 05:20.569
- How is that me?
- Okay, ahem.

05:20.737 --> 05:21.737
I'm Chandler.

05:23.114 --> 05:26.658
- Ha, ha! That is so you!
- Ha-ha-ha.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.911
- When have I ever done that?
- When have I ever done that?

05:35.084 --> 05:37.044
- Trick or treat.
- Oh!

05:40.089 --> 05:43.842
Oh, you're just the prettiest ballerina
ever I've ever seen.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.053
Thank you.

05:46.220 --> 05:49.014
Oh, wow. That deserves another candy.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.433
- Thank you.
- Ha-ha-ha.

05:53.436 --> 05:57.105
I have to say,
that earns "two-two" pieces of candy.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.066
I love you!

05:59.233 --> 06:01.651
Oh! Aw...

06:01.819 --> 06:03.779
Oh, honey, here, take it all.

06:09.243 --> 06:11.370
Monica? We need more candy.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.414
- What? There's only been four kids.
- I know.

06:14.582 --> 06:18.168
But one said she loved me,
so I gave her everything.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.337
No wonder you're pregnant.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.883
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:26.344 --> 06:31.098
- What are you supposed to be?
- Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik?

06:33.017 --> 06:37.646
Well, I'm a potato. Or a "spud"...

06:37.814 --> 06:40.899
...and these are my antenna.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.194
So Sputnik becomes?

06:48.199 --> 06:51.827
Spud-nik! Spud-nik.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.081
Wow, I don't have
the worst costume anymore.

06:58.126 --> 07:01.503
Hey, all right! Ross came as doodie.

07:03.673 --> 07:07.342
- No, I'm not doodie.
- No, space-doodie.

07:16.352 --> 07:17.853
- God!
- Hey, sweetie.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.983
- Aren't you gonna give me a kiss?
- Okay, I will.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.485
But right after, you have to tell me
who you are.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.989
- Ursula?
- Ursula's fiancé?

07:29.157 --> 07:30.866
- Oh, my God. You're the sister.
- Yeah.

07:31.033 --> 07:34.536
- I just slapped my future sister-in-law's ass.
- Yeah.

07:34.704 --> 07:38.165
I'm an idiot. Is your mother here?
I could give her a slap on the butt.

07:38.332 --> 07:41.960
- My mother killed herself.
- See, and I knew that.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.047
Now I'm sweating.

07:46.215 --> 07:51.761
I'm really sweating. Now I'm saying look
at me, I'm even sweatier. I should go.

07:51.929 --> 07:53.805
No. We'll start over.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.766
- Hi, I'm Phoebe.
- Eric.

07:56.934 --> 07:59.728
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- The sweat's in my eyes.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.563
- It's burning.
- Okay.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.023
- Thank you.
- There.

08:03.191 --> 08:06.067
- So, what are you?
- I don't think they have a name for it.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.403
I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.

08:10.823 --> 08:15.494
- No, I meant your costume.
- Oh, um, I'm a solar system.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.913
My student's helped me.
I teach second grade.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.916
- I love the second grade.
- Really?

08:21.083 --> 08:24.127
It's better than first grade,
where you don't know what's going on.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.922
And definitely better than third grade.

08:27.089 --> 08:30.759
You know, with all the politics
and the mind games.

08:31.469 --> 08:35.764
- So, what do you do?
- I'm a masseuse, by day.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.727
- You don't have to stand here with me.
- I'm having fun.

08:40.895 --> 08:46.149
- I'm really excited for you and Ursula.
- I feel very lucky. She's great.

08:46.484 --> 08:50.445
- She's the most beautiful woman ever.
- Thank you.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.828
- Hey, Joey?
- Yeah?

08:58.996 --> 09:02.374
- You read comic books, right?
- Exclusively.

09:03.084 --> 09:06.670
Who do you think would win in a fight,
Catwoman or Supergirl?

09:06.837 --> 09:09.089
- Catwoman, hands down.
- Yeah.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.592
Between you and Phoebe?
I'd give the edge to Phoebe.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.719
- What? Really?
- You kidding?

09:14.887 --> 09:20.642
Phoebe lived on the street, okay?
Plus, she's got this crazy temper. She...

09:20.810 --> 09:22.978
She's not right behind me, is she?

09:23.729 --> 09:25.105
- No, you're fine.
- Okay.

09:25.273 --> 09:28.483
- Do you think I could take Rachel?
- I'm not sure.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.986
What? Come on, I am tough!

09:31.153 --> 09:34.072
Punch me here, as hard as you can!

09:34.240 --> 09:37.617
Relax. What are you taking this
so seriously for? It doesn't matter.

09:37.785 --> 09:42.831
Really? What would you say if I told you
Ross or Chandler could beat you up?

09:42.999 --> 09:45.208
I would say, "Woman, please."

09:47.670 --> 09:50.547
Hey, Ursula's fiancé is really sweet.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.258
He's a teacher,
he does volunteer work.

09:53.426 --> 09:59.222
Normally, I don't like sweaty guys.
But I could just mop him up.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.684
- Oh, my God, Phoebe?
- What?

10:02.852 --> 10:04.894
You're getting a crush
on your sister's fiancé.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.605
No, I'm not, you are!

10:08.190 --> 10:10.150
Here comes the temper.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.488
- Trick or treat.
- Hi.

10:15.656 --> 10:19.826
Hi. Know what? We're out of candy.
But someone went to get some.

10:19.994 --> 10:24.914
And I've been giving out money,
but I'm out of that too.

10:25.082 --> 10:27.459
- Can I write you a check?
- Okay.

10:27.627 --> 10:31.463
- Okay. What's your name?
- Lelani Mayolanofavich.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.260
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out
to "cash."

10:39.513 --> 10:41.723
- Hi.
- Hi, Mona.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.892
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.562
Joey's gonna be thrilled. He was hoping
you'd come by as a slutty nurse.

10:48.522 --> 10:51.274
Um, actually, I'm just a nurse.

10:53.235 --> 10:56.780
You'd think that would embarrass me,
but, you see, I'm maxed out.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.617
- Hey, you made it.
- Hi! Wait.

11:00.785 --> 11:05.163
- You're, um... You're a potato?
- Well, I'm a spud?

11:05.331 --> 11:06.956
And the antenna...

11:07.124 --> 11:09.751
- Oh, my God, you're Spud-nik!
- Yes!

11:10.586 --> 11:12.212
Marry her.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.632
Okay, here's a good one for you.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.593
Who do you think would win a fight
between Ross and Chandler?

11:18.761 --> 11:21.262
I can't answer that.
Chandler's my husband.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.932
- So Ross?
- Yeah.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.435
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hello, handsome.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.937
Oh, God.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.942
Aw, look at you two.
So when did you guys meet?

11:34.110 --> 11:36.569
- Two weeks ago.
- Two weeks, that's it?

11:36.737 --> 11:40.573
I know. It sounds crazy, and it's not
like me to do something impulsive.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.660
But she's so perfect,
and we have so much in common.

11:43.828 --> 11:44.911
Oh, really?

11:45.079 --> 11:47.497
- We're both teachers.
- Huh?

11:49.417 --> 11:52.377
- And we were both in the Peace Corps.
- Peace Corps, really?

11:55.172 --> 11:57.799
In fact, when we were
building houses in Uruguay...

11:57.967 --> 12:01.386
...we were just two towns apart
and we never met.

12:01.595 --> 12:05.515
Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got
there, but it was a town when I left.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.854
- Shall we get me really drunk?
- Sure.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.482
Ha, ha. Ugh.

12:16.485 --> 12:18.695
Howdy, doodie.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.822
That's funny, yeah.

12:20.990 --> 12:25.869
You're the funniest man here in a
bunny costume his wife made him wear.

12:26.704 --> 12:30.540
Relax, man. Relax.
You're looking a little flushed.

12:35.671 --> 12:38.339
Hey, I think we might find out
the answer to our question.

12:38.507 --> 12:41.634
- What question?
- Who could kick whose ass in a fight...

12:41.802 --> 12:42.886
...you or Ross?

12:43.596 --> 12:47.056
- There's no question.
- So you think Ross too?

12:49.852 --> 12:52.353
- You picked Ross?
- Ross is really strong.

12:52.521 --> 12:56.691
He's the strongest out of all three
of you. Except for Joey.

12:57.985 --> 13:02.864
- I can not believe you didn't pick me.
- In her defense, she's right. I am stronger.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.116
I would destroy you.

13:05.284 --> 13:09.996
Oh, really? You think you're stronger?
Why don't you prove it?

13:10.915 --> 13:13.666
Oh, I'll prove it.
I'll prove it like a theorem!

13:13.834 --> 13:17.128
All right! Okay, stop it. Stop it!

13:17.296 --> 13:19.380
Stop! No one's gonna fight.

13:19.548 --> 13:23.218
People came to see a fight,
let's give them what they came for!

13:25.262 --> 13:29.682
- You guys could arm-wrestle.
- Yeah, listen to the slutty nurse.

13:30.434 --> 13:33.394
- You're going down.
- Oh, yeah? You're going further down.

13:33.562 --> 13:34.771
Downtown!

13:34.939 --> 13:37.899
Seriously, guys,
the trash talk is embarrassing.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.911
Oh, Gunther, you brought candy.
Thank you so much for picking this up.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.997
- You are so sweet.
- Really?

13:53.165 --> 13:57.210
Someday, you are gonna make some man
the luckiest guy in the world.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.089
- Got to go.
- Trick or treat.

14:01.549 --> 14:05.176
Hi! Wow! There you go.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.721
My friend Lewis told me
you were giving out money.

14:09.890 --> 14:13.309
Oh, yeah, we were,
but, um, now we've got candy.

14:13.477 --> 14:16.604
I'd rather have the money.

14:17.731 --> 14:20.650
Well, that's not your choice.
Happy Halloween!

14:20.818 --> 14:22.193
This isn't fair.

14:22.361 --> 14:25.780
Is it fair that all you did was put on a cape
and I gotta give you stuff?

14:25.948 --> 14:27.949
Shut up!

14:28.450 --> 14:29.742
You shut up!

14:31.662 --> 14:35.790
- You can't tell me to shut up.
- Uh, I think I just did.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.376
And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!

14:39.378 --> 14:41.546
- Uh, Rach.
- No, I got it. I'm good. I got it.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.134
Wait, I had one more thing to say.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.927
Oh, right. Shut up.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.722
You're a mean old woman.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.765
Oh, wait! No. Shut... Don't cry!

14:52.933 --> 14:55.059
Let me get my checkbook!

14:55.227 --> 14:57.395
Honey, you don't have to do this.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.440
It's the strength you have inside
that means the most to me.

15:00.608 --> 15:04.903
You're loyal, you're honest
and you have integrity.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.156
That's the strength I want
in the man I love.

15:08.324 --> 15:11.451
That means nothing to me. Come on!

15:11.911 --> 15:13.077
Ugh.

15:13.495 --> 15:15.204
- Hi, liar.
- Hey.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.499
You know, the only reason
he's marrying you...

15:18.667 --> 15:21.878
...is because he thinks the things
you were saying were true.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.631
- They could be true.
- But they're not.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.216
Yeah. It's a fine line, huh?

15:28.135 --> 15:31.012
- Why are you lying to him?
- I don't know.

15:31.180 --> 15:36.017
He said he did this stuff, I said I did it
too. He got so excited, it was fun.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.310
Honey?

15:37.478 --> 15:42.357
It's a disgusting habit,
and I want you to quit now!

15:42.524 --> 15:45.193
She's helped so many people
quit smoking.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.695
We'd better get going.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.823
- You have a church group meeting.
- Right.

15:54.078 --> 15:58.081
- Well, it was nice meeting you.
- You too.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.961
And, Ursula, it was really nice
meeting you tonight!

16:03.128 --> 16:06.130
Pheebs, come on! Bunny versus Doodie.
We're waiting!

16:09.176 --> 16:12.595
Okay, guys. One match,
winner take all.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.265
Wait. What does the winner get?

16:16.433 --> 16:18.309
- Pride.
- And dignity.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.187
Heh. Okay, if you say so.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.398
All right, ready, set, go!

16:25.109 --> 16:26.734
Come on!

16:33.200 --> 16:38.830
- Wow, they're both really strong.
- Or equally weak.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.834
Oh, God. Chandler's making
his sex face.

16:48.424 --> 16:53.720
- So you getting tired?
- No. I could do this all day.

16:53.887 --> 16:56.264
Yeah. Me too.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.561
- Getting a little tired, though.
- God, I'm exhausted.

17:02.604 --> 17:07.858
This is starting to look bad for me,
okay? Mona's standing right there.

17:08.944 --> 17:13.114
Oh, God, she's talking to Joey!
You've got to let me win!

17:13.281 --> 17:16.075
No way. Let me win.
My wife thinks I'm a wimp.

17:16.242 --> 17:17.827
Hey, at least you have a wife.

17:17.994 --> 17:21.622
I keep getting divorces
and knocking people up.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.294
And I'm dressed as doodie.

17:27.212 --> 17:32.300
- You're Spud-nik.
- Come on, who we kidding? I'm doodie.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.095
- Please? She's watching.
- Ugh.

17:36.972 --> 17:39.474
- Fine.
- Thanks.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.061
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah!

17:43.228 --> 17:44.812
Yay!

17:44.980 --> 17:46.731
My hero!

17:46.899 --> 17:48.232
You're a weird lady.

17:52.654 --> 17:55.448
- Hey, Ursula said she left her purse.
- Oh.

17:55.616 --> 17:59.410
What a relief. It has the numbers
of the people in her prayer chain.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.204
I'm sure it does. Yeah. Yeah.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.748
Well, guess I'll see you at the wedding.

18:06.335 --> 18:10.046
Um, listen. I don't think I'm gonna
make it to the wedding.

18:10.214 --> 18:14.008
- I wish you all the luck in the world.
- We'll be okay.

18:14.176 --> 18:18.513
It's so perfect,
and she's been saving herself for me.

18:20.349 --> 18:24.310
- I can't let you do this. She's lying to you.
- What?

18:24.478 --> 18:28.689
She is lying. And I bet
I could prove it. Excuse me.

18:28.857 --> 18:32.193
Okay. Yeah, not a prayer chain.

18:32.361 --> 18:36.322
But what looks like a detailed drawing
of a bank floor plan.

18:37.991 --> 18:42.995
Here's the name tag from the restaurant
where she works as a waitress.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.540
Not a teacher, a waitress.

18:45.707 --> 18:48.668
Here's her driver's license.
She always lies about this.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.963
- How old did she say she was?
- She told me she was 25.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.882
Aw. I almost don't want to show you this.

18:56.343 --> 18:59.428
Just remember, I'm a minute younger.

19:02.057 --> 19:03.641
I am so stupid.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.811
Of course she's lying.
She's not a teacher.

19:07.020 --> 19:12.483
There's no such thing as a "Top Secret
School for the Children of Spies."

19:14.611 --> 19:16.863
No, you're not stupid.

19:17.698 --> 19:18.823
I'm not smart.

19:23.453 --> 19:27.915
I just wanted so much
to be impulsive for once.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.293
- To be romantic.
- That's good.

19:30.460 --> 19:33.838
You should be impulsive
and you should be romantic.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.215
Just, you did it with the wrong person.

19:38.760 --> 19:42.722
- What?
- It's weird, two people look so alike.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.515
And so different.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.145
Eric! Let's go!

19:50.647 --> 19:54.192
- Better go deal with it.
- Yeah, you should.

20:00.073 --> 20:02.783
Hurry up! I gotta pray!

20:12.502 --> 20:14.086
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:14.463 --> 20:17.381
Well, I had to give the kid
50 bucks to stop crying.

20:18.675 --> 20:21.719
- That's not so bad.
- I also had to go to a couple houses...

20:21.887 --> 20:23.763
...as his girlfriend.

20:24.514 --> 20:27.141
Ugh, I am just awful with children.

20:27.309 --> 20:31.729
Come on, you're good with kids.
They're just crazy on Halloween.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.649
They're all greedy,
hopped up on sugar.

20:35.651 --> 20:38.402
- Really? That's all it is?
- Absolutely.

20:38.570 --> 20:45.076
Halloween is the worst. Except
for Christmas. And their birthdays.

20:45.327 --> 20:48.412
They get crazy during the summer too.

20:48.664 --> 20:52.124
And any time they're
hungry or sleepy.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.585
Kids are tough.
Good luck with that. Pfft.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.510
Look, I wanted to tell you,
I'm sorry you lost.

21:02.678 --> 21:06.472
Oh, listen. I got a secret for you.
I let him win.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.850
- Heh, heh.
- Was that a secret, or a lie?

21:10.018 --> 21:12.353
- No, I let him... Ross?
- Yeah?

21:12.521 --> 21:14.730
Would you tell her
I let you win, please?

21:14.898 --> 21:18.150
Oh, yeah, uh, Chandler let me win.

21:20.070 --> 21:24.156
No, Chandler's really strong.
Oh, my arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?

21:26.201 --> 21:29.120
I am strong. I'll show you.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.913
Chandler, please.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.999
Oh, what's the matter? Are you scared?

21:34.001 --> 21:35.584
Let's go, big bunny!

21:37.170 --> 21:39.338
One, two, three. Go!

21:45.387 --> 21:47.096
I'm gonna kill myself.
