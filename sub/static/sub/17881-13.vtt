00:04.200 --> 00:06.351
The Board of Directors has a meeting 
this week and upper management

00:06.352 --> 00:09.199
wants to present a new idea on 
how to increase productivity.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.000
Something impressive,
that will razzle-dazzle them.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.000
Should I get to work 
on a musical number?

00:14.301 --> 00:18.200
- If your profits...
- And curtain.

00:18.350 --> 00:21.050
When the Board's in town, the company
always tries to find ways

00:21.051 --> 00:22.400
to get people to work harder.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.200
They've tried stimulating them 
with an idea

00:24.201 --> 00:26.125
they got from a Japanese game show.

00:30.501 --> 00:31.850
Sorry.

00:32.601 --> 00:34.299
- He's coming.
- Quick, let's go light the candles. 

00:34.300 --> 00:37.400
They even tried pumping
extra oxygen into the building 

00:40.300 --> 00:42.159
So what's in the fun bag this time? 

00:42.160 --> 00:45.480
One of the executives takes his daughters
to a game arcade and when they win,

00:45.481 --> 00:47.900
they get tickets which they trade in 
for prizes. 

00:48.000 --> 00:51.070
Even though the prizes are worthless,
the little girls

00:51.071 --> 00:53.051
work themselves into a psychotic
frenzy trying to win them. 

00:53.250 --> 00:55.999
So we're replacing our department
with psychotic little girls?

00:56.000 --> 01:00.700
That was discussed, but instead we're going to 
reward hard work by giving people tickets. 

01:00.900 --> 01:01.999
For worthless prizes.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.299
You have an impressive handle on this.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.849
That must be why they picked you 

01:04.851 --> 01:06.550
to run the program for our department. 

01:06.570 --> 01:08.200
Congratulations.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.500
Oh, no, Ritchie in nanoscience

01:11.501 --> 01:13.699
wrote a message in  
our petri dishes again.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.199
Damn him and his super-duper
teeny tiny nano-pen.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.199
What does it say?

01:17.200 --> 01:19.400
I rub (see next petri dish)

01:21.600 --> 01:23.799
my dude-berries on your ...

01:23.800 --> 01:24.920
On our what?

01:24.930 --> 01:27.650
Lunchboxes, Doorknobs, the back
of our knees? Let me see!

01:28.850 --> 01:31.119
Microscope eyepiece.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.399
My Eyes!

01:33.400 --> 01:35.599
Hey, what's up junk-lovers?

01:35.600 --> 01:38.500
Your eyes enjoying my mangerines?

01:41.930 --> 01:45.000
- What is it about us that invites ridicule?
- I don't know.

01:45.001 --> 01:48.720
We invent neat stuff. We're delightful.
And yet no one respects us.

01:48.730 --> 01:51.465
Not even that cafeteria lady with
that hideous tongue birthmark

01:51.466 --> 01:53.500
that looks like a smaller
and more hideous tongue. 

01:54.040 --> 01:57.699
You know, we need to find a way to get
Ritchie and everyone else to respect us.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.299
To show them that we're a quasi-awesome
force of nature.

02:00.300 --> 02:05.200
Like a tornado. But one that stays
out of town so no one gets hurt.

02:06.500 --> 02:10.070
And I'm the idiot, that has to evaluate 
everyone's work and hand out prize tickets.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.840
Once again, I regret not double-majoring
in Business and Carnywork

02:12.841 --> 02:14.978
like my conjoined-twin stockbrokers.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.780
Have some pudding.

02:19.500 --> 02:23.100
Mmm. Better. My mom always says there's 
nothing in the world pudding can't cure  

02:23.400 --> 02:26.299
except for my dad's obesity,
which it's made exponentially worse. 

02:26.300 --> 02:28.130
You've got a little in your hair.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.445
Are we interrupting something?

02:31.450 --> 02:33.040
Ah, no. Linda had pudding in her hair.

02:33.050 --> 02:34.000
We help each other out.

02:34.001 --> 02:36.520
Yesterday Ted had a turkey
dinner in his head.

02:37.230 --> 02:41.499
So, is it true? We're gonna get awesome
Veridian merchandise if we work hard?

02:41.500 --> 02:43.250
Yeah. Let's go with awesome.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.499
And I have the awarding tickets.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.599
I'm gonna save up for
missile launcher.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.049
I have a problem with crows
in my yard.

02:49.050 --> 02:52.400
Actually, the gifts are more like
a sweatshirt or a cd player.

02:52.401 --> 02:54.499
Maybe a crow feeder for Linda's lawn.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.120
And with a sign that says:
"Crows, go get other crows".

02:57.130 --> 02:58.940
But crows are impervious to sarcasm.

02:58.950 --> 03:00.749
Do you have a sign that says:
"Stay away, crows"?

03:00.750 --> 03:02.600
We do. We have one.
But it was painted by Picasso,

03:02.601 --> 03:05.267
so it costs a million tickets.

03:06.801 --> 03:11.199
You guys think you're so cool with your
inside jokes.We've got inside jokes, too.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.199
Hey, Susan. Remember the green hat?

03:13.200 --> 03:14.499
- No.
- Damn you, Susan.

03:14.500 --> 03:17.899
- Hey, check it out. I got 30 tickets.
- I only got 20.

03:17.900 --> 03:21.149
I got 23. Sorry, Sheila, but I did.

03:21.150 --> 03:24.049
I wonder why Linda got so many more
tickets than us. I wonder why.

03:24.050 --> 03:25.649
What are you saying, Sheila?
What are you saying?

03:25.650 --> 03:28.099
I'm saying you're sleeping with Ted.

03:28.100 --> 03:33.099
What? I'm not sleeping with Ted. And if I
were, this envelope would be much bigger.

03:33.100 --> 03:36.200
Takes more than 30 tickets
to ride this roller coaster.

03:38.400 --> 03:41.219
Hey-o! The boss is in the house,
everybody put your pants back on.

03:41.230 --> 03:43.699
- Zing, bang, Sir.
- Yes, I know.

03:43.700 --> 03:47.949
So, with the board meeting this week,
our former C.E.O Arthur Wells is in town.

03:47.950 --> 03:50.149
Arthur Wells? That man is a legend.

03:50.150 --> 03:53.949
Wasn't he behind the Veridian acquiring
ownership of the african country of Tchad?

03:53.950 --> 03:56.199
And then re-naming it after
his nephew Chad?

03:56.200 --> 04:00.199
In his day, he was a genius, but now
he is an old horrible pain in the ass.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.000
Really, I can't say enough bad
things about him.

04:03.001 --> 04:06.499
We can't have Arthur wandering around
the building, stirring up troubles.

04:06.500 --> 04:09.220
So, I want you to babysit him
while he's here.

04:09.230 --> 04:11.020
Stick with him, don't let
him out of your sight.

04:11.030 --> 04:13.100
Gee, chet, I'm flattered you would
come to me with this

04:13.101 --> 04:17.700
- but my plate is so full this week.
- Oh, I don't care about that.

04:23.750 --> 04:28.399
You must be Arthur Wells. 
I recognize you from the effigies they burn of you in Tchad

04:28.400 --> 04:33.600
Ah, found it, i'm taking your swipecard, and ... 

04:34.900 --> 04:36.199
I also need your help.

04:36.230 --> 04:38.520
I don't know,
I need to hear exactly what you want

04:38.521 --> 04:40.800
before I can tell you to go to hell.

04:40.820 --> 04:43.000
The board of directors are going to try to vote me out this week

04:43.001 --> 04:47.819
but i've got an insurance policy 
that's gonna keep that from happening.

04:47.820 --> 04:50.439
This is a receipt from the airport bar for 7 scotches.

04:50.450 --> 04:52.679
Drinking keeps me warm and approchable.

04:52.680 --> 04:57.250
Oh here. It's a map.
My mentor who ran this place before me

04:57.251 --> 04:59.259
left it to me in his will.

04:59.260 --> 05:01.840
It leads to papers he hid years ago in this building

05:01.841 --> 05:05.000
papers that contain secrets

05:05.001 --> 05:06.830
that could bring this whole company down

05:06.840 --> 05:09.500
And while we're searching for "Curly's Gold"

05:09.501 --> 05:11.000
we could look around for where you lost your mind

05:11.001 --> 05:13.000
No the papers are here.

05:13.001 --> 05:16.340
Since i left this building has been
redesigned more times than my wifes face

05:16.341 --> 05:18.179
so i need your help find my way around

05:18.180 --> 05:20.599
Ah, now I can say it.
Go to hell.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.800
I could wander around by myself.
Who knows what kind of mischief

05:24.801 --> 05:27.699
crazy old man like me could get in to. 
Have you forgotten the lessons of Mr. Magoo

05:30.080 --> 05:33.300
I wish you were a cartoon.
Then i could say Yabadabadoo

05:33.301 --> 05:36.000
and that creature from E.T. would attack you.

05:37.301 --> 05:39.000
I didn't watch a lot of cartoons.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.001
So, here is something kinda interesting

05:43.002 --> 05:46.449
People in the office thinks 
your dunkin' your donunt in my coffee.

05:46.450 --> 05:49.699
What? That's crazy.
Plus why am i the donut? 

05:49.700 --> 05:52.000
I don't know. But apparently i'm the hot cup of sex,

05:52.001 --> 05:54.249
you dip your strange circular stuff in.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.749
Why would people
think we're having sex?

05:58.230 --> 05:59.219
You touched my hair.

05:59.220 --> 06:03.349
- But this is horrible.
- Horrible?

06:03.350 --> 06:05.055
You're saying that the idea of sleeping
with me is horrible?

06:05.060 --> 06:08.469
- No, I'm not saying you're repulsive.
- Where did repulsive come from?

06:08.470 --> 06:10.800
All I'm saying is that if people
think I'm sleeping with you

06:10.801 --> 06:12.949
that undermines my credibility
as an executive

06:12.950 --> 06:15.899
So I'm bad for your precious career?

06:15.900 --> 06:18.000
This is the Frosty Scoop all over again,

06:18.001 --> 06:19.700
and you're Derek Spooner,
the night manager

06:19.701 --> 06:22.110
you mullet wearing
moonwalking bastard.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.920
At the risk of taking Derek Spooner's
side, your affair with him

06:24.921 --> 06:27.399
probably took his career a few sliding
step backwards.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.699
While appearing to move forward.

06:28.700 --> 06:31.120
Actually, I was the best thing that
ever happened to Derek Spooner

06:31.121 --> 06:33.459
until he frozed to death in the
cooler while he was getting high.

06:33.460 --> 06:37.160
I am a boss and I need people to
think that I'm imparcial.

06:37.170 --> 06:39.412
Maybe we should just stay away
from each other for a while.

06:39.413 --> 06:41.309
Let the whole sex thing die out.

06:41.310 --> 06:42.899
Worked for my parents.

06:42.900 --> 06:45.720
Fine. Let's just stay away
from each other, Ted.

06:45.730 --> 06:47.970
Right now I'm thinking that
won't be a problem.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.000
Turns out, people really like
getting useless stuff

06:54.001 --> 06:57.500
and so the ticket system
caught on immediately.

06:58.700 --> 07:01.010
Okay, you know how were looking to get a little respect?

07:01.020 --> 07:04.699
What if we got that marionet and put on an awsome kick-ass puppetshow.?    

07:04.700 --> 07:05.679
With one marionet?

07:05.680 --> 07:09.040
Okay, how about this:
Hal Holbrook as Mark Twain?

07:09.050 --> 07:11.699
You mean we dress up the marione as
Hal Holbrook doing Mark Twain?

07:11.700 --> 07:13.399
No, the marionet is not in it anymore.

07:13.400 --> 07:17.310
We get Hal Holbrook to come to Veridian,
and do Mark Twain.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.499
Still not seeing it.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.799
Okay, what if we stage a fight,
where we beat up Hal Halbrook?

07:21.800 --> 07:22.499
As Mark Twain?

07:22.500 --> 07:23.949
No, Mark Twain's not in it any more.

07:23.950 --> 07:26.400
- I don't know.
- Yeah, maybe there's nothing there.

07:28.001 --> 07:30.699
Hey, what if we get these 
Veridian-Dynamics beltbuckles?

07:30.700 --> 07:34.020
They'd earn us some respect.
Feel like having a Rolex holding up your pants.

07:34.030 --> 07:35.699
They cost 200 tickets.

07:35.700 --> 07:38.870
Ted only gave us 20 for our presentation on planetary resources

07:38.871 --> 07:43.010
even though we talked for 10 minutes about
mining Uranus without giggling.

07:43.200 --> 07:47.200
I know. You can't find Hydrocarbons on a gasplanet.

07:49.525 --> 07:52.500
So now i'm stuck leading this living liverspot around the building

07:52.501 --> 07:56.700
trying to read this indecipherable booze soaked map, and...

08:00.330 --> 08:04.199
- Are you petting me?
- I'm moving your hair out of your eyes.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.169
Something i do for everybody.

08:06.170 --> 08:08.000
My hair is in a bun, it can't get in my eyes

08:08.001 --> 08:11.330
unless you scalp me and throw 
the whole works back in my face.

08:11.340 --> 08:15.600
People think i'm having an affair with Linda,
because i groomed her in public.

08:15.610 --> 08:18.070
I'd judge you, but i'm on a treasurehunt.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.639
Oh, he's out of the bathromm and on the move.

08:19.640 --> 08:23.500
Here i go, making good use of my Stanford education.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.860
Ted, I traded my tickets
for this sweatshirt

08:27.861 --> 08:29.049
but it's too tight.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.699
i have a bit of a bosom, i have to be careful.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.760
- So take it back, Lonnie.
- They said no exchanges.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.809
Your the swag master Ted, help me.

08:35.820 --> 08:40.500
Well, i'd like to, but that would be special treatment,
and i don't give special treatment to anybody.

08:47.115 --> 08:51.299
I see where this is going Ted 
and i'm not giving you a firm no.

08:51.300 --> 08:54.100
I will take that as a firm no.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.100
This ticket thing is circling the drain.

08:59.140 --> 09:03.000
See, this is the kind of craziness i would normally talk to Linda about.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:15.520 --> 09:17.800
Sorry, Spooner, didn't see you there.

09:18.500 --> 09:21.139
She's mad at me.
But I'm doing the right thing.

09:21.150 --> 09:23.900
She'll get over it. Right?

09:24.810 --> 09:26.530
I saw Ritchie at the swag station

09:26.531 --> 09:28.489
looking at our Veridian-Dynamics beltbuckles.

09:28.490 --> 09:30.510
- What if he gets one first?
- What are we gonna do?

09:30.520 --> 09:32.149
We still need 180 tickets.

09:32.150 --> 09:33.599
Actually we need 190.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.299
I spend 10 on hilbilly teeth.

09:35.300 --> 09:36.499
You what?

09:37.700 --> 09:39.200
Oh, how can I be mad at you?

09:41.280 --> 09:43.650
If only there was a way to
get more tickets now,

09:43.651 --> 09:46.520
so we could be the first one
to get those buckles.

09:46.530 --> 09:49.800
What if we printed out
a bunch of fake tickets?

09:49.801 --> 09:53.040
Then, when we earn the real ones,
we tear those ones up.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.519
It would be like
giving ourselves a loan.

09:55.520 --> 09:59.170
And borrowing against the future
is what built this country.

09:59.180 --> 10:03.370
It's true, Phil. That's what
made our economy the envy of the world.

10:03.800 --> 10:07.000
Here are 400 tickets. You can
counterfeit them. It's easy.

10:07.001 --> 10:10.200
I mean you can count them, it's easy.
It's not easy to counterfeit them,

10:10.201 --> 10:13.039
it takes hours. I mean it would have,
if we did.

10:13.040 --> 10:16.500
Which we did.. not do.

10:16.510 --> 10:20.399
Hi. These ticket are real and
we'd like two belt buckles.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.769
Wow. I'm so impressed.
You guys have so many tickets.

10:23.770 --> 10:27.300
I don't even have enough
to get this Baby T.

10:28.100 --> 10:31.089
I bet she'd respect a couple fellas
who could give her some tickets.

10:31.090 --> 10:34.400
Let's print more tickets.
Let's print them all.

10:42.130 --> 10:43.600
If we go down any deeper in this building,

10:43.601 --> 10:46.000
we'll come up in the basement of our Hong-Kong office.

10:46.001 --> 10:48.749
Dear god, you've said that joke six times.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.665
This is our last sub-basement.

10:50.666 --> 10:53.480
If your make believe treasure is any place in this building, which it isn't,

10:53.481 --> 10:56.010
we'll find it here, which we won't.

11:04.670 --> 11:09.480
- It's hollow, there's something back here.
- Really? Let me see.

11:10.230 --> 11:12.980
Oh my God, I found it.

11:14.130 --> 11:17.668
I'm building you a car that runs on saltwater,
and all i get is a lousy 15 tickets. 

11:17.669 --> 11:20.300
Jimmy, all you've shown me is a toycar,
a cup of saltwtaer

11:20.301 --> 11:22.099
and som transparently desperate confidence.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.128
- It will work.
- Yeah, that.

11:24.129 --> 11:28.100
Hey Ted, this yo-yo doesn't glow,
what kind of crap are you trying to pull.

11:29.030 --> 11:30.100
It has to be dark, Lonnie.

11:39.760 --> 11:42.329
This ticket thing is out of control.
Lonnie is mad because he's yo-yo doesn't glow in the light.

11:42.330 --> 11:43.990
and Patricia is mad, because se expected her seamonkeys

11:43.991 --> 11:46.300
to be reading a newspaper and riding a bike.

11:46.301 --> 11:47.699
But the whole thing is just murky water.

11:47.700 --> 11:49.900
What are you doing?
You're not supposed to be talking to me.

11:49.901 --> 11:51.509
People will think you love
the hideous girl.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.859
I did not call you hideous,
I called you repulsive.

11:53.860 --> 11:55.689
And I didn't call you repulsive either.

11:55.690 --> 11:57.449
Besides nobody's watching. We can talk.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.000
Sorry Ted, you lost the right to talk to me, 
when you decided,

12:00.001 --> 12:02.499
you care more about what the people in the office think,
than you do about our friendship. 

12:02.500 --> 12:07.169
I care about our friendship, i care...
There's is that tea i've been looking for

12:09.670 --> 12:12.100
Mmm, herbal.
Does that look mean you want tea?

12:12.601 --> 12:14.649
Look Linda, i really missed talking to you.

12:14.650 --> 12:17.380
Poor Ted. Why don't you smoke that tea, climb into the freezer

12:17.381 --> 12:19.700
and pull a full on spooner.

12:24.430 --> 12:25.319
Check it out.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.520
- Bam
- Pull

12:26.530 --> 12:28.820
- Bam.
- Yee-how.

12:28.830 --> 12:31.000
Hold the elevator.

12:32.540 --> 12:34.500
Thanks for your help, buddy.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.052
Thanks for the tickets.
You guys rock.

12:41.253 --> 12:43.119
- How are you feeling, my friend?
- Feeling huge.

12:43.120 --> 12:46.400
- Respect, baby.
- That's all I'm saying.

12:50.390 --> 12:55.139
There are documents in here.
Okay, here's what's gonna happen:

12:55.140 --> 12:58.079
First I'm gonna apologize
for calling you crazy.

12:58.080 --> 13:01.350
Second, I'm gonna turn these damaging
company secrets over to my boss,

13:01.351 --> 13:03.769
So I'll be a hero for
saving the company.

13:03.770 --> 13:06.959
And third, if you're nice, I'll help
you find your way out of the basement.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.800
If I may respond...

13:39.251 --> 13:42.860
so i know how to use this
and i made my own end table.

13:48.050 --> 13:52.300
- You're stuck, princess.
- Feliz Navadad, buttmunch.

14:04.840 --> 14:07.809
- Sawing is hard.
- So is holding up wood.

14:07.810 --> 14:09.666
Alright, new idea.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.699
- Okay, what if we break up?
- What are you talking about?

14:20.700 --> 14:22.149
We'll spread a rumor that we broke up.

14:22.150 --> 14:24.787
and when our pretend relationship is over,
we can be friends again.

14:24.788 --> 14:25.889
That's a great idea.

14:25.890 --> 14:28.919
In fact, it such a great idea, why
wait for a rumor to spread?

14:28.920 --> 14:31.399
- You no-good louse.
- Oh, dear.

14:31.700 --> 14:35.279
That's right Crisp, I'm breaking up
with you, right here and right now.

14:35.280 --> 14:39.019
- Okay, then it's over. Bye.
- You wanna know why?

14:39.020 --> 14:40.759
- Actually, I said bye, not why.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.699
Okay, I'll tell you why.
Because you're selfish.

14:43.700 --> 14:48.449
Everything is about your career,
your job, your hair.

14:48.450 --> 14:51.400
Then, after you've neglect me,
you realise how spectacular I am

14:51.401 --> 14:53.029
and you tried to make
it up with gifts.

14:53.030 --> 14:56.629
- Oh, the gifts.
- Gee, I sound like a monster.

14:56.630 --> 15:00.819
The jewellery, flowers, clothes, cattle.
Cattle?

15:00.820 --> 15:05.259
- Yes, cattle. What were you thinking.
- They looked smaller in the catlouge?

15:05.260 --> 15:09.500
Well, they were huge.
And you and I are through.

15:11.320 --> 15:15.839
Poor Ted. Poor, sad Ted.
Here's 100 tickets.

15:15.840 --> 15:19.720
- Buy yourself a little pick-me up.
- Where did you get this tickets.

15:19.721 --> 15:21.730
Your work sucks.

15:23.500 --> 15:26.350
My name is Mark Twain and
I am made of wood.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.487
I want to be a real boy.

15:28.488 --> 15:32.126
Let me know when you're open to
some constructive criticism.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.895
I need 10 tickets.
I'll pay for them with this pie.

15:37.900 --> 15:40.712
- You come in here and talk to us like this? - I thought you liked pie.

15:40.713 --> 15:43.256
We do like pie, Ritchie.
You know what else we like?

15:43.257 --> 15:46.000
Respect. We're not selling tickets.

15:46.057 --> 15:50.864
- Now, if you come to us as a friend...
- then tickets will rain down on you.

15:50.865 --> 15:53.589
Then may I give you this pie
as a friend?

15:53.590 --> 15:56.519
- I love this guy.
- Nice.

15:56.520 --> 16:01.000
Hey, Ted. Wow. Look at all these tickets
We think Ritchie is counterfeiting them.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.400
Screw you, guys.

16:03.700 --> 16:06.559
Can you believe what that guy did?

16:06.560 --> 16:08.219
- It was us.
- All us.

16:08.220 --> 16:11.259
I'm taking away your puppet. Because
I want you to think about what you did.

16:11.290 --> 16:15.020
- Not the puppet, Ted.
- Yes, the puppet.

16:16.500 --> 16:20.170
This has to hurt or you'll never learn.

16:20.390 --> 16:23.895
He did you a favour.
That show is going nowhere.

16:27.650 --> 16:29.859
When did you say your mentor hid these?

16:31.590 --> 16:33.499
He was really sitting on something
back then.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.830
Smoking causes cancer?

16:35.840 --> 16:38.814
What else they've got in there?
Eve eats the apple?

16:38.815 --> 16:41.899
These documents are useless, Arthur.

16:41.900 --> 16:46.000
And now I've got nothing to keep
the board from voting me out.

16:46.001 --> 16:49.259
You know the hardest thing:
I still get ideas.

16:49.260 --> 16:51.719
Well, maybe you could
work somewhere else.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.979
I see a lot of older people mall walking.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.522
I don't know what that pays.

16:55.523 --> 16:57.600
You give your whole life to a place,
and then when they are done with you

16:57.601 --> 17:00.135
they just turn you out.

17:01.030 --> 17:04.236
I hope they never do this to you.

17:08.480 --> 17:11.319
I'm gonna kill the ticket-thing.
You care ?

17:11.329 --> 17:13.229
- No.
- Really?

17:13.230 --> 17:16.199
Because you seem to be taking
it kinda hard.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.900
It's Arthur.
There really were secret documents,

17:18.901 --> 17:20.550
but they turned out to be worthless.

17:20.550 --> 17:22.039
So now they're gonna throw
him off the board.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.128
- But I thought you hated him?
- I did.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.730
And then he grabbed me by the ankles
and attacked me with a piece of wood

17:26.731 --> 17:30.778
and everything changed.
He's given his life to this place, Ted

17:30.820 --> 17:33.159
Just like I have.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.499
Man, I kicked him hard in the balls.

17:36.500 --> 17:40.149
Veronica, Ted. I just wanted to thank
you for keeping an eye on Arthur.

17:40.150 --> 17:43.970
He's in the board room right now,
We're about to vote him out.

17:44.050 --> 17:46.001
Actually, before you move on Arthur,
sir

17:46.002 --> 17:47.600
you should know that he found
some documents

17:47.601 --> 17:52.001
and if you vote him off the board he
will expose the company's worst secret.

17:52.014 --> 17:54.329
That's right. I'm saying that.

17:54.730 --> 17:57.799
Wait a minute. He found out about
the thing?

17:57.800 --> 18:01.860
Yes. He knows all about the thing.

18:01.870 --> 18:05.840
Oh, God. If he knows about the thing,
that means he knows about the other thing,

18:05.841 --> 18:09.180
which would ruin the thing
we all live on.

18:09.190 --> 18:13.549
Apparently so, Sir.
I think he even knows about the stuff.

18:13.550 --> 18:19.300
That's okay, everybody knows about the stuff,
but the thing, that's gonna be a problem.

18:20.001 --> 18:22.600
I guess Arthur stays.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.399
That was nice, what you did.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.050
Well, when the company decides
it's my time to go,

18:28.051 --> 18:29.699
I just hope
somebody stands up for me.

18:29.700 --> 18:32.539
Well don't worry, by then the stuff will probably have gotten all of us

18:32.540 --> 18:37.199
Don't joke about the stuff, Ted.
It can tell and it doesn't like it.

18:37.200 --> 18:42.832
- This place is scary.
- Really? I'm just getting comfortable with it.

18:49.230 --> 18:52.139
Sorry i unloaded on you when we broke up.

18:52.140 --> 18:53.239
Well, i had it coming.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.500
I kinda freaked out when you said that 

18:54.501 --> 18:56.049
everyone thought we were sleeping together.

18:56.050 --> 18:58.199
You kinda did.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.105
For the record, if were in a real relationship,

19:01.400 --> 19:03.910
i wouldn't care what anyone said about anything.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.000
- What are you saying ?
- I'm saying what i'm saying.

19:06.001 --> 19:09.449
That's not acceptable.
You have to actually say something.

19:09.650 --> 19:13.330
I missed you.
And if we where in a relationship

19:13.331 --> 19:16.539
i would want everyone to know.
I'd scream it from a mountaintop,

19:16.940 --> 19:19.344
or whatever the straight equivalent of that is.

19:19.345 --> 19:22.624
There is no straight equivalent for that.

19:22.720 --> 19:25.120
And i missed you too.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.029
Why didn't you tell us what V.D meant?

19:42.030 --> 19:44.700
Why?

19:46.880 --> 19:48.439
So, what do we think
of Ted and Linda kissing?

19:48.440 --> 19:50.345
I'm for it.
I like when attractive people kiss.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.969
Me too. I like when attractive people
do anything.

19:52.970 --> 19:55.530
I was once knocked up my rollerskates
by a beautiful woman

19:55.531 --> 19:58.786
driving a bus. It was very pleasant.

19:59.750 --> 20:02.059
It's too bad Ted's making us
get rid of all these.

20:02.060 --> 20:06.339
We're just gonna set these here
while we both go to the bathroom.

20:06.340 --> 20:09.180
We just both have to go.
It happens.

20:11.130 --> 20:14.030
Unless Ted is wrong about human nature,
in 5 minutes, so many tickets

20:14.031 --> 20:17.440
so many tickets will flap this way,
the whole system will crash

20:17.699 --> 20:20.889
Look at that. Disgusting.

20:20.890 --> 20:22.559
Ecxept for those two attractive people.

20:22.560 --> 20:25.100
Yes. That part is very pleasant.
