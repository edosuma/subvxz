WEBVTT

02:55.542 --> 02:57.175
Over 90 channels.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.843
Fridge, rice cooker here.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.778
Swimming pool is on roof.

03:00.780 --> 03:03.881
You have water in the fridge
and fresh fruit from the market.

03:03.883 --> 03:06.918
Here's an inventory list.
Everything is in order.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.653
Thanks.

03:09.889 --> 03:11.656
- Wi-Fi password?
- All in here.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.925
The network, password,
contact details.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.194
Oh, here's a map.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.962
We are here.

03:17.964 --> 03:21.799
Floral market, famous pagoda,
Chinatown, Notre Dame Cathedral.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.969
OK. Thank you.

03:29.742 --> 03:31.542
Three sets of keys.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.344
- Any problem, please call me.
- Sure.

03:33.346 --> 03:35.713
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.080
Hello.

09:44.951 --> 09:47.217
- How are you?
- Good.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.987
Come in.

09:54.060 --> 09:56.060
Was it easy to find?

09:56.062 --> 09:58.362
Your directions were good.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.669
My daughter. Katie.

10:05.671 --> 10:08.305
- Hello.
- Hello, Katie.

10:08.307 --> 10:10.841
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

10:10.843 --> 10:12.610
She is six.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.378
Speaks a little English.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.847
I teach her.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.995
Where are you staying?

10:32.064 --> 10:34.365
Thao Dien, in District 2.

10:47.246 --> 10:50.848
If I see you in the street,
I cannot recognise you.

10:52.885 --> 10:56.120
It's been a long time. 30 years.

10:56.122 --> 10:58.822
Same age as Katie when you left.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.397
Do you remember my mother?

11:06.399 --> 11:10.300
She read stories to you
when you were very young.

11:10.302 --> 11:13.070
Yeah, I have
a vague remembrance of that.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.878
My Vietnamese
isn't very good any more.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.180
Do you mind
telling her that for me?

11:26.852 --> 11:28.452
Ah.

11:37.329 --> 11:39.730
We sang from my mother's song book.

11:39.732 --> 11:41.432
Your mother would join.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.701
She liked to show off her voice.

11:45.104 --> 11:47.304
Yeah, I can believe that.

11:47.306 --> 11:50.074
How long are you here?

11:50.075 --> 11:52.843
Once I settle everything,
I'd like to travel a bit.

11:52.845 --> 11:55.813
So... I'm not really sure.

11:55.815 --> 11:57.448
You should visit your old home.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.917
Yeah, I'm going to.

12:03.956 --> 12:06.323
I actually brought
some presents.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.996
That's just some biscuits.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.501
Some chocolates.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.938
Whisky.

12:23.876 --> 12:26.477
This is really good.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.346
You put tap water in it
and it filters it clean.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.221
Yeah, I...

12:37.223 --> 12:39.423
I didn't know what you would...

12:41.360 --> 12:42.960
I hope you like them.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.928
So many gifts.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.531
Thank you.

12:47.533 --> 12:49.266
Your English is very good.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.535
Better than your Vietnamese.

12:52.872 --> 12:54.004
How'd you learn it?

12:54.006 --> 12:56.473
I used to show tourists
around the city.

12:57.143 --> 12:59.910
Walking tours.

12:59.912 --> 13:01.845
Will you visit Ba Chieu market?

13:01.847 --> 13:04.815
- Yeah, I went there.
- Changed so much, no?

13:04.817 --> 13:07.217
I remember some things but...

13:09.054 --> 13:11.121
..others, it's not very clear.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.157
We played there.

13:13.159 --> 13:17.127
I have this picture
of me and two boys

13:17.129 --> 13:19.196
trying to search out
for crickets.

13:19.198 --> 13:20.564
Yes.

13:20.566 --> 13:23.066
That was with me.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.915
- Hello, everybody.
ALL: Hello.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.651
My name is Tran,
I'm your tour guide for today.

14:47.653 --> 14:49.553
We will go to Cu Chi tunnel now

14:49.555 --> 14:51.989
and the trip will be around
two hours 30 minutes

14:51.991 --> 14:54.191
and there will be
two toilet stops.

14:54.193 --> 14:55.959
We will have lunch at Cu Chi

14:55.961 --> 14:57.494
and then start heading back
for Saigon

14:57.496 --> 15:00.530
around five or six,
depending on the traffic, OK?

16:01.360 --> 16:03.694
¶ KUMI SOLO:
I Know What Boys Like

16:23.148 --> 16:25.415
- There you go.
- Thank you.

16:27.186 --> 16:29.052
I love this song.
Do you know it?

16:29.054 --> 16:31.188
No, I've not heard of it.

16:31.190 --> 16:33.023
It's a cover of The Waitresses.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.524
And I love
that she keeps her accent.

16:34.526 --> 16:36.360
That's what makes the song.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.401
And how are you finding Saigon?

16:44.403 --> 16:48.038
My God, it's intense.
It's relentless.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.207
Is it your first time here?

16:50.209 --> 16:53.210
Yeah.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.712
You look like your picture,
thank God.

16:57.783 --> 17:00.017
Everything I said was true.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.685
Age, size...

17:01.687 --> 17:03.754
- Yeah?
- ..height.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.789
Better to be honest.

17:05.791 --> 17:09.493
I don't mean we reveal
our innermost secrets, you know.

17:09.495 --> 17:11.528
You know, just the basics.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.630
Things that are...

17:13.632 --> 17:15.399
You know, that have...

17:15.401 --> 17:17.401
Well, you know.

17:17.403 --> 17:19.302
I'm rambling.

17:19.304 --> 17:22.439
¶ LAURA BRANIGAN:
Self Control

17:23.308 --> 17:25.409
What?

17:25.411 --> 17:27.377
"Please don't waste my time.

17:27.379 --> 17:30.647
Be forthcoming
with recent clear face pics.

17:30.649 --> 17:32.482
I want to see your eyes.

17:32.484 --> 17:35.252
Be honest and upfront
with your intentions."

17:35.254 --> 17:37.788
I sound fucking crazy.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.734
This is nice.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.643
Stressful day?

17:59.645 --> 18:01.545
No, no.

18:01.547 --> 18:04.147
I just had some errands,
bought a new lamp.

18:04.149 --> 18:06.450
Boring stuff, really. You?

18:08.854 --> 18:11.321
I had a walk
round my neighbourhood.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.758
They have networking nights
here.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.427
Oh, yeah?

18:16.428 --> 18:18.095
Well, no,
it's at their other bar,

18:18.097 --> 18:20.764
near where you're staying.
It's called Somo.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.633
It's become a big event.
I often go.

18:25.304 --> 18:29.840
<i> ¶ I haven't got the will</i>
<i> to try and fight</i>

18:29.842 --> 18:34.611

21:13.705 --> 21:16.539
Are you the manager?

21:16.541 --> 21:18.842
MAN:
I'm CEO.

21:25.917 --> 21:28.752
You want new phone?

21:28.754 --> 21:30.987
No, I'm OK. Thank you.

21:49.474 --> 21:52.475
I bought this for my mum.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.878
Everything else
was too complicated.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.486
Call.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.355
Hang up.

22:05.357 --> 22:07.357
That's it.

22:07.993 --> 22:12.062
Simple. Perfect.

22:12.064 --> 22:15.665
Your mum... loaned us some money
for this shop.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.502
I remember her saying.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.640
Here, eat.

22:31.616 --> 22:34.384
Looking forward to this.
I'm salivating.

22:37.656 --> 22:40.557
I went to our old flat.

22:40.559 --> 22:43.426
I wanted to have a look inside.

22:43.428 --> 22:45.895
- Did you?
- No.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.504
I tried to find
that... that pond.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.072
The one out the back.

22:56.074 --> 22:57.907
That's filled in now.

23:01.947 --> 23:04.514
Hien... does he remember much?

23:04.516 --> 23:06.816
He remembers more.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.619
He's called Henry now.

23:09.621 --> 23:11.388
Henry?

23:19.631 --> 23:22.665
One morning, I went looking
for you and Henry.

23:24.636 --> 23:26.870
Everything was same...

23:28.039 --> 23:30.440
..the door, the street.

23:31.109 --> 23:32.842
Exactly the same.

23:32.844 --> 23:35.745
But... no one there.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.624
Henry and his family
are coming soon.

23:47.626 --> 23:49.826
I'm sure they'd love to see you.

23:50.495 --> 23:52.028
He's married?

23:52.030 --> 23:53.596
Yeah.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.766
He's got two kids,
Bruce and Lee.

24:00.806 --> 24:02.572
Do you have any children?

24:02.574 --> 24:04.441
No.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.748
I had no idea
that we were leaving.

24:12.818 --> 24:14.751
Mum said
that we couldn't tell anyone

24:14.753 --> 24:16.820
in case we got caught.

24:19.758 --> 24:22.625
I went to sleep one night and...

24:22.627 --> 24:24.794
..when I woke up,
I was on a boat.

24:24.796 --> 24:27.096
Drifted for days.

24:32.504 --> 24:35.004
Did your family try to escape?

24:35.006 --> 24:38.608
Your father got caught and taken
to a re-education camp.

24:39.711 --> 24:41.744
It scared everybody.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.547
Very risky after that.

24:44.549 --> 24:46.015
Are you sure?

24:46.017 --> 24:48.017
I don't think
that was my father.

24:48.019 --> 24:50.854
He tried to escape on his own.

24:50.856 --> 24:52.989
He was caught.

24:52.991 --> 24:56.926
After release,
there was no choice.

24:56.928 --> 24:58.728
All of you must escape together.

24:58.730 --> 25:01.030
Who told you that?

25:01.800 --> 25:03.800
My mother.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.952
Hey, can you hear me?

25:56.788 --> 25:58.221
Hold on a sec.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.690
How's that? Is that better?

26:02.160 --> 26:04.227
How are you? You look good.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.629
Relaxed.

26:13.705 --> 26:16.005
It feels a bit odd.

26:21.980 --> 26:24.581
Not much.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.916
It's all different now,
isn't it?

26:32.857 --> 26:35.058
There's this separation.

26:40.198 --> 26:42.665
Yeah, I felt like a tourist.

26:45.870 --> 26:48.972
I saw Lee and his family.

26:48.974 --> 26:51.975
I brought over some presents...

26:51.977 --> 26:55.845
..a shortbread tin with
the Royal Family on it and...

26:55.847 --> 26:57.947
..this bowl
that filters tap water.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.016
Jesus.

27:00.852 --> 27:02.018
Who brings presents

27:02.020 --> 27:04.754
with the Royal Family
printed all over it?

27:04.756 --> 27:07.357
It's so archaic, patronising.

27:09.995 --> 27:12.261
Well, it wasn't meant to be.

27:15.967 --> 27:19.068
<i>I went to where we used to live</i>
<i> and the market.</i>

27:20.805 --> 27:22.405
<i> I don't know.</i>

27:22.407 --> 27:24.841
<i>I want to see the other places.</i>

27:30.348 --> 27:32.181
<i> Yeah, I know that.</i>

27:32.183 --> 27:34.684
<i> It just doesn't feel right.</i>

27:37.756 --> 27:39.789
<i> I'm fine.</i>

27:40.792 --> 27:43.092
<i> Don't be. Really, it's OK.</i>

27:43.995 --> 27:45.995
<i> I'm fine.</i>

27:50.168 --> 27:52.435
<i> Yeah, me too.</i>

27:53.872 --> 27:55.438
<i> Me too.</i>

28:57.202 --> 28:59.869
WOMAN: Sophie runs it here,
I run it up in Hanoi.

28:59.871 --> 29:03.005
- And we alternate every year.
- SOPHIE: It's our business.

29:03.007 --> 29:05.775
- Is the arts scene big here?
- Yeah, it's growing.

29:05.777 --> 29:07.810
Our tour is about
the history of art,

29:07.812 --> 29:10.780
from colonialism
to the two Indo-China wars,

29:10.782 --> 29:11.814
up to now.

29:11.816 --> 29:13.416
Are you American?

29:13.418 --> 29:15.051
No.

29:15.053 --> 29:17.420
I'm Vietnamese. I'm from Hanoi.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.756
You should do our tour,
it's very interesting.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.090
- No, I'd love to.
- Great.

29:21.092 --> 29:23.092
Thank you.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.428
I don't have my
card, I'm afraid.

29:26.397 --> 29:28.197
So what do you do?

29:28.199 --> 29:30.032
I animate.

29:30.034 --> 29:32.935
Mainly apps and online stuff.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.937
Hey.

29:34.939 --> 29:37.039
- Hey.
- OK?

29:37.041 --> 29:38.541
Yeah.

29:39.844 --> 29:41.544
This is Lewis.

29:41.546 --> 29:43.279
- Sophie and Linh.
- Hey.

29:43.281 --> 29:46.449
They do the...
They run the art tour.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.484
I've been. I'm a fan.

29:48.486 --> 29:50.219
Here.

29:50.221 --> 29:52.021
Right.

29:52.023 --> 29:53.556
Thank you.

29:53.558 --> 29:57.193
- So are you here for work?
- More of an extended holiday.

29:57.195 --> 29:59.228
No job to return to?

29:59.230 --> 30:01.197
No, I quit.

30:01.199 --> 30:03.866
- To go travelling?
- Yeah.

30:07.972 --> 30:10.006
You look bored.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.208
No, not at all.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.545
Didn't think I'd see you again.

30:16.347 --> 30:18.848
I'm glad you came.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.518
What do you think of the event?

30:24.489 --> 30:26.589
Saigon's really thriving.

30:26.591 --> 30:28.491
It's a hive of opportunities.

30:28.493 --> 30:31.294
You can really make something
of yourself here.

30:31.296 --> 30:32.962
Is that why you're here?

30:32.964 --> 30:35.198
I'm here to oversee
the production

30:35.200 --> 30:37.200
of my clothing company.

30:37.202 --> 30:39.602
To exploit cheap labour?

30:39.604 --> 30:42.839
To contribute towards
their growing economy.

30:47.545 --> 30:49.445
This is one of my designs.

30:49.447 --> 30:51.414
It's really nice.

30:51.416 --> 30:53.316
Yeah, it's a cool brand.

30:53.318 --> 30:55.017
Why Curve?

30:55.019 --> 30:57.253
Cos I'm not straight.

30:58.556 --> 31:00.189
Nice.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.624
Totally awesome, man.

31:01.626 --> 31:03.993
- Are you laughing at me?
- No, I'm not.

31:03.995 --> 31:07.029
I wasn't.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.532
It's a nice name,
with your own curve.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.534
I get it. It's playful.

31:12.470 --> 31:13.870
Fucker.

32:02.487 --> 32:04.654
So, how are you finding
District 2?

32:10.028 --> 32:12.428
It doesn't feel
like the rest of Saigon.

32:13.398 --> 32:15.315
I mean, there are some parts

32:15.316 --> 32:17.233
that remind me of the Vietnam
that I grew up in.

32:17.235 --> 32:19.135
Mainly the poorer parts.

32:19.137 --> 32:21.203
Like that street
behind the hospital.

32:21.205 --> 32:24.340
When we first met, you said
it was your first time here.

32:24.342 --> 32:25.708
Did I?

32:25.710 --> 32:27.610
Yeah.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.478
You did.

32:31.416 --> 32:33.215
I lied.

32:33.217 --> 32:35.217
Sorry.

32:36.154 --> 32:37.653
Why?

32:39.657 --> 32:41.557
To keep it simple.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.132
You just can't get enough of me,
can you?

32:50.134 --> 32:52.401
I have that effect.

32:56.574 --> 32:58.607
So you were born here?

32:58.609 --> 33:00.176
Yeah.

33:00.178 --> 33:03.012
Here in Saigon.

33:03.014 --> 33:05.414
How old were you
when you left here?

33:07.452 --> 33:09.318
Six.

33:11.189 --> 33:13.456
Yeah, I was also born
after the war.

33:18.096 --> 33:20.029
Just a beer.

33:20.031 --> 33:21.998
I'll have the same.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.066
- Do you have any siblings?
- No.

33:24.068 --> 33:26.202
No family?

33:26.204 --> 33:28.137
Yeah, my mother's in New Jersey.

33:28.139 --> 33:32.708
She's my delivery
coordinator/line manager.

33:34.112 --> 33:36.345
What did your parents do here?

33:38.216 --> 33:41.450
My dad worked for
a Southern Vietnamese official.

33:42.587 --> 33:46.522
Delivery man, driver, helper.

33:46.524 --> 33:49.325
Was he under suspicion
after the reunification?

33:50.695 --> 33:53.129
Yeah, he was.

33:54.399 --> 33:58.134
- Cam on.
- Cam on.

34:08.379 --> 34:13.315
When I was getting ready
to come here my first time...

34:13.317 --> 34:17.253
..I thought about sewing
a Canadian badge on my backpack.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.824
I just wasn't sure...

34:23.261 --> 34:25.061
..how they'd treat me.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.679
Do you ever feel a sense...

34:26.680 --> 34:28.296
It's not my gener...
I don't mean I don't.

34:28.299 --> 34:31.500
It's not that I don't feel
any guilt. Of course I do.

34:34.338 --> 34:36.205
Ask me again.

34:37.141 --> 34:38.741
How do you feel?

34:40.211 --> 34:42.178
I'm great. I'm perfect.

34:42.180 --> 34:44.447
Look at me.

34:56.194 --> 34:59.495
In the beginning,
I felt unprepared.

35:02.867 --> 35:05.101
But the kids here...

35:05.103 --> 35:07.136
they don't care
about the war any more.

35:07.138 --> 35:10.773
They want their dreams...
their careers.

35:12.143 --> 35:13.843
I remember growing up in London.

35:13.845 --> 35:16.846
Every Vietnamese person I met
lost a family member here.

35:16.848 --> 35:19.515
Yeah, it took a great deal
out of us too.

35:21.219 --> 35:24.620
A generation forgotten,
a country divided.

35:28.526 --> 35:31.160
It's not a war
we can recall with pride.

35:33.197 --> 35:35.865
Why would you want
to recall it with pride?

35:45.276 --> 35:47.476
Anyway, I didn't sew the badge.

37:47.665 --> 37:49.932
What is it?

38:09.453 --> 38:12.321
Can I smoke in here?

38:12.323 --> 38:14.623
You've got to go outside.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.929
Is the wooden box an urn?

38:22.466 --> 38:25.467
It's my mother's ashes.

38:25.469 --> 38:27.770
We're returning them home.

38:30.741 --> 38:33.008
Who's "we"?

38:35.846 --> 38:38.047
My brother arrives next week...

38:39.016 --> 38:41.517
..with my father's ashes.

38:46.357 --> 38:48.557
It's not what you think, though.

38:49.694 --> 38:51.593
They passed at different times,

38:51.595 --> 38:54.063
Mum more recently,
about a year ago now.

38:54.065 --> 38:56.031
Where will you scatter
the ashes?

38:56.033 --> 38:58.834
I hardly recognise this country
any more.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.539
My parents rarely talked of it.

39:04.909 --> 39:07.743
You never asked them?

39:07.745 --> 39:10.813
It was like drawing blood
from a stone.

39:10.815 --> 39:13.349
It was a traumatic time
for them.

39:14.785 --> 39:17.953
Do you remember
when you were young?

39:17.955 --> 39:21.357
You were so desperate to be
like everybody else...

39:22.893 --> 39:24.860
..to have fun...

39:24.862 --> 39:27.129
join the Scouts, go camping.

39:28.966 --> 39:32.501
How they loved to go camping.

39:32.503 --> 39:34.903
They loved
boil-in-the-bag bloody rice.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.841
For fuck's sake.

39:43.481 --> 39:45.748
Then suddenly they're gone.

39:48.486 --> 39:50.886
And there's this cavity.

39:50.888 --> 39:54.089
If only I knew then
what I know now.

39:54.091 --> 39:58.460
I would have asked them all day,
every day, just wore them down.

40:00.798 --> 40:02.531
Should you wait
for your brother?

40:02.533 --> 40:05.901
No, he's happy
for me to do the searching.

40:05.903 --> 40:09.037
Just choose somewhere
obvious and tacky.

40:09.039 --> 40:10.906
Do you have anywhere in mind?

40:10.908 --> 40:13.175
Somewhere momentous.

40:15.579 --> 40:18.781
What about where you lived?

40:18.783 --> 40:21.650
I think they're gonna
knock that down soon.

40:24.789 --> 40:26.989
How about where they were born?

40:28.859 --> 40:32.494
Yeah, I'm heading over to Hanoi.
It's where they're from.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.434
When are you going?

40:38.436 --> 40:42.104
A couple of days.
I'm taking the train.

40:44.208 --> 40:46.608
And then your brother
arrives after that?

40:46.610 --> 40:48.444
Yeah.

40:53.584 --> 40:57.486
You'll love Hanoi.
It hasn't changed much.

40:57.488 --> 41:00.689
- Really?
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

41:00.691 --> 41:03.959
Your parents' old house
might look exactly as it was.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.664
I can give you a lift
to the station.

41:10.968 --> 41:12.801
You don't have to.

41:35.025 --> 41:37.526
The pond was here.

41:43.701 --> 41:46.068
I've got fond memories
of this place.

41:48.072 --> 41:50.239
There was a wooden bridge
over the pond

41:50.241 --> 41:51.640
to these communal toilets.

41:51.642 --> 41:54.643
Yes. Every year
they have a festival.

41:54.645 --> 41:56.945
To catch the fish.

42:21.138 --> 42:22.638
Here.

42:22.640 --> 42:25.307
Your parents' old address
in Hanoi.

42:26.610 --> 42:28.143
We'd like to be there.

42:28.145 --> 42:29.978
We will find the right place.

42:29.980 --> 42:32.281
No, of course. Absolutely.

42:35.953 --> 42:38.153
Can I ask you something?

42:39.623 --> 42:42.024
Sure.

42:42.026 --> 42:44.960
Do you have photos of my family
when we were young here?

42:44.962 --> 42:46.962
I don't know.

42:46.964 --> 42:49.298
My father burnt
all our pictures.

42:51.302 --> 42:53.201
When we escaped,
he was so worried

42:53.203 --> 42:54.836
that if the government
found pictures

42:54.838 --> 42:58.807
of our friends and family,
they'd be punished.

42:58.809 --> 43:00.576
So he burnt them all.

43:01.178 --> 43:02.844
I'll ask my mum.

43:12.656 --> 43:15.023
It's a local temple.
No tourists.

43:19.797 --> 43:22.130
Our families
would come here often.

43:25.636 --> 43:27.336
No?

43:30.274 --> 43:33.742
Saigon is changing
so quickly now.

43:33.744 --> 43:36.878
But this place
has stayed the same.

43:36.880 --> 43:39.081
She's the goddess of seafarers.

43:56.734 --> 43:59.668
I know the streets
like the back of my hand.

44:01.772 --> 44:03.705
What's funny?

44:03.707 --> 44:06.241
No, it's just...
It's a nice expression.

44:12.049 --> 44:15.917
Why has it been so long
for you to return?

44:18.689 --> 44:20.722
Out of respect.

44:20.724 --> 44:22.924
They forbade us.

44:24.962 --> 44:26.862
You're a good son.

44:30.968 --> 44:33.268
You must miss her.

45:01.298 --> 45:03.732
Want a piggyback
to the entrance?

45:04.868 --> 45:06.868
Please don't.

45:11.341 --> 45:13.375
I'd better go.

45:14.111 --> 45:15.911
Hey, wait.

45:19.249 --> 45:20.882
The other night...

45:20.884 --> 45:22.751
I don't want you to think
that I'm...

45:22.753 --> 45:24.920
I mean, I do believe
a generation was lost.

45:24.922 --> 45:26.605
My dad was one of them.

45:26.606 --> 45:28.289
But I am not one of those Yanks
that think we've won

45:28.292 --> 45:30.192
and sticks
a freakin' flag in it.

45:30.194 --> 45:32.461
I'm clearly not that, right?

45:40.003 --> 45:42.370
- Take it easy.
- Yeah.

45:42.372 --> 45:44.806
Take it easy.

48:11.622 --> 48:13.388
Do you know

48:13.390 --> 48:15.991
if there is any communal
carriage here?

48:17.494 --> 48:19.594
There isn't.

48:19.596 --> 48:23.498
There are some carriages with
seats, but they're all numbered.

48:34.678 --> 48:37.112
I'm Stephane.

48:37.915 --> 48:39.014
Kit.

48:39.016 --> 48:41.449
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

48:49.126 --> 48:51.126
Are you English?

48:51.128 --> 48:53.395
Yeah.

48:53.397 --> 48:55.463
- You?
- French.

48:55.465 --> 48:57.966
Brest... Bretagne.

49:04.574 --> 49:06.708
Where are you heading to?

49:06.710 --> 49:09.077
To Da Nang and then to Hoi.
What about you?

49:09.079 --> 49:11.980
I'm getting off at Hanoi.

49:11.982 --> 49:14.215
38 hours. Good luck with that.

54:12.849 --> 54:15.783
Hello? Hello?

54:17.954 --> 54:20.855
Hello, boys! How are you?

54:27.297 --> 54:29.864
Well, he is very mean.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.440
Oh, Lord.

54:40.710 --> 54:42.677
Ohh, it is so hot!

54:42.679 --> 54:45.680
You boys are gonna be
sweating like little pigs!

54:53.790 --> 54:57.058
Me too. I can't wait to see you.

54:57.060 --> 55:00.395
I'll see you soon. Bye!

55:00.397 --> 55:02.797
Bye!

55:06.403 --> 55:08.770
They're pretty excited,
aren't they?

55:15.412 --> 55:17.545
Lewis.

55:17.547 --> 55:18.813
He's American.

55:24.854 --> 55:28.523
<i> There's this...</i>
<i> old soul about him.</i>

55:28.525 --> 55:30.658
<i> You know?</i>

55:31.961 --> 55:34.429
<i> Anyway, I'm in Hanoi.</i>

55:36.933 --> 55:38.866
<i> I did.</i>

55:39.869 --> 55:42.837
<i> I'm just not sure.</i>

55:42.839 --> 55:45.073
<i> I don't know any more.</i>

55:50.080 --> 55:52.080
<i> It's tiring.</i>

55:52.082 --> 55:54.349
<i> I feel tired.</i>

55:58.088 --> 56:01.055
<i> Yeah, I remember that.</i>

56:01.057 --> 56:04.392
<i> It meant everything to them</i>
<i> that we went to uni.</i>

56:07.430 --> 56:10.064
But you wanted to be
in a rap group, didn't you?

56:12.102 --> 56:14.135
The Mixed Boyz!

56:16.005 --> 56:20.108
Oh! They made you
hold your ears and kneel down!

56:22.946 --> 56:25.146
What were you thinking?

56:27.150 --> 56:29.083
LINH: We'll look
at the Franco-Vietnamese

56:29.085 --> 56:30.685
and American-Vietnam War.

56:30.687 --> 56:32.053
How artists became these tools

56:32.055 --> 56:34.422
for boosting morale
and for communicating

56:34.424 --> 56:36.457
and the works
that came out from that.

56:36.459 --> 56:38.826
We then compare
Northern and Southern art.

56:38.828 --> 56:41.028
The last chapter
is contemporary art,

56:41.030 --> 56:42.980
which is very exciting,

56:42.981 --> 56:44.931
because this is about young
people today producing works

56:44.934 --> 56:46.134
and the organisations

56:46.136 --> 56:48.102
facilitating
and connecting them.

56:48.104 --> 56:50.438
We'll actually end our tour
back here.

56:50.440 --> 56:53.975
Please, use the toilet now
and we'll start our tour soon.

56:57.447 --> 56:59.180
- Hello.
- Hi.

56:59.182 --> 57:01.416
- You remembered me.
- Of course.

57:01.418 --> 57:04.652
- Um... welcome to Hanoi.
- Thank you.

57:04.654 --> 57:06.187
This is your first time, right?

57:06.189 --> 57:07.989
Yeah, it is.

57:07.991 --> 57:09.957
Where's your handsome friend?

57:09.959 --> 57:12.059
I forgot his name.

57:12.061 --> 57:13.728
Lewis.

57:13.730 --> 57:15.630
It's just me.

57:17.200 --> 57:19.434
Mm.

57:19.436 --> 57:22.637
I think it was probably the most
unique tour I've been on.

57:22.639 --> 57:24.572
Thank you.

57:24.574 --> 57:26.641
I mean, it's super-insightful.

57:26.643 --> 57:28.609
How do you put it all together?

57:28.611 --> 57:30.077
It's mainly Sophie.

57:30.079 --> 57:32.480
I help out with translation
and researching.

57:32.482 --> 57:34.182
I'm impressed.

57:35.718 --> 57:37.952
Tell my parents that.

57:40.223 --> 57:42.023
Do they not approve?

57:42.025 --> 57:45.760
They want me to scent tea,
take over the family business.

57:46.763 --> 57:49.197
- Right.
- It's...

57:57.841 --> 57:59.106
Mm.

57:59.108 --> 58:01.609
My family makes lotus tea.

58:02.712 --> 58:04.245
That's my parents' favourite.

58:04.247 --> 58:06.481
I mean,
they're from here originally.

58:06.483 --> 58:07.915
Do you like it?

58:07.917 --> 58:09.817
I can't say that I've tried it.

58:09.819 --> 58:13.688
Exactly. No one drinks it
any more, only old people.

58:15.959 --> 58:18.192
Do you want to see it?

58:18.194 --> 58:20.995
Yeah, I'd love to.
I mean, is that all right?

58:20.997 --> 58:22.597
You have to work.

58:22.599 --> 58:24.866
My mum gets paranoid
you'll steal the family secret.

58:24.868 --> 58:26.868
Oh, I promise
not to steal a thing.

58:26.870 --> 58:29.604
There are strict rules
before you can help.

58:29.606 --> 58:32.123
What are those?

58:32.124 --> 58:34.641
No eating durian or jackfruit
before scenting,

58:34.644 --> 58:37.879
and if you have been
to a funeral

58:37.881 --> 58:39.714
or if you're menstruating.

58:39.716 --> 58:42.583
Well, I can safely say
I haven't done any of those.

58:42.585 --> 58:44.986
- So... I'm good.
- Good.

59:07.076 --> 59:09.310
It smells incredible in here.

59:18.755 --> 59:21.122
What's this used for?

59:24.894 --> 59:28.195
She asks where in Hanoi
your parents are from.

59:28.197 --> 59:30.197
Hoan Kim Lake, around there.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.236
These are dried
and used in soups.

59:35.238 --> 59:38.172
We throw nothing away.
Every part is edible.

59:44.981 --> 59:47.281
She said
it lowers the blood pressure.

1:00:01.598 --> 1:00:03.264
Are you bored yet?

1:00:03.266 --> 1:00:05.933
No.

1:00:05.935 --> 1:00:08.135
You look bored, though.

1:00:09.272 --> 1:00:11.939
Every day is like this.

1:00:11.941 --> 1:00:15.009
Lotuses are picked
before sunrise,

1:00:15.011 --> 1:00:17.311
we do this for 27 days.

1:00:17.313 --> 1:00:19.213
Then it's ready.

1:00:26.923 --> 1:00:29.857
My mother asks,
"Why did you choose England?"

1:00:36.032 --> 1:00:37.965
The camps in Hong Kong...

1:00:37.967 --> 1:00:39.900
they asked my mother
where she wanted to go.

1:00:39.902 --> 1:00:44.038
Everybody chose America,
Australia, France.

1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:45.840
No one wanted to go to England

1:00:45.842 --> 1:00:48.309
because they said
it was too cold.

1:00:48.311 --> 1:00:50.344
Of course, she chose England.

1:00:50.346 --> 1:00:52.313
They all wondered why.

1:00:52.315 --> 1:00:55.249
She said,

1:00:55.251 --> 1:00:58.719
"I want to go England because
I love the Queen very much.

1:00:58.721 --> 1:01:00.688
She very polite.

1:01:00.690 --> 1:01:03.224
Very happy."

1:01:03.226 --> 1:01:06.160
She saw a bloody picture
of the Queen and she liked it.

1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:46.160
Are you OK?

1:02:46.162 --> 1:02:48.129
It's just...

1:02:48.131 --> 1:02:51.232
It's ridiculous.

1:02:51.234 --> 1:02:54.802
What are we meant to do
with these photographs?

1:02:54.804 --> 1:02:57.304
Did your parents
ever come back to Vietnam?

1:02:57.306 --> 1:02:59.540
Never.

1:02:59.542 --> 1:03:02.843
It must have been very painful
for them, not to come back.

1:03:05.081 --> 1:03:07.114
She seemed sweet.

1:03:07.116 --> 1:03:09.183
That story of the Queen
was funny.

1:03:09.185 --> 1:03:11.252
She was formidable.

1:03:14.257 --> 1:03:18.058
My parents are always
talking about the war.

1:03:18.060 --> 1:03:20.094
My grandfather died in it.

1:03:20.096 --> 1:03:21.562
I'm sorry.

1:03:21.564 --> 1:03:23.397
I never met him.

1:03:30.239 --> 1:03:32.206
The smallest size we have.

1:03:32.208 --> 1:03:35.142
I've included the instructions
in there for you.

1:03:35.144 --> 1:03:37.211
This is perfect. Thank you.

1:03:37.213 --> 1:03:38.913
How much do I owe you?

1:03:38.915 --> 1:03:41.582
- It's OK.
- No, I'd like to pay you.

1:03:41.584 --> 1:03:44.084
It's fine. No one drinks it
any more, anyway.

1:03:44.086 --> 1:03:45.519
I fucking love tea.

1:03:45.521 --> 1:03:47.922
Our tea is too expensive
for everyday drinking.

1:03:47.924 --> 1:03:51.058
There are brands that use
aroma oils for their scenting.

1:03:51.060 --> 1:03:53.294
It's quick, cheap
and sells a lot.

1:03:53.296 --> 1:03:55.863
The quality, it's inferior,
right?

1:03:55.865 --> 1:03:58.833
How will my menstruation
affect the quality?

1:04:00.837 --> 1:04:03.337
That's the superstitious part
of tradition.

1:04:03.339 --> 1:04:05.206
I want to travel.

1:04:05.208 --> 1:04:07.842
But they've spent so much money
on my education.

1:04:07.844 --> 1:04:09.376
All their savings.

1:04:27.296 --> 1:04:29.930
¶ THANH LAN:
Tinh Dem Lien Hoan

1:07:41.757 --> 1:07:43.590
Hey.

1:07:43.592 --> 1:07:45.492
Hello.

1:07:49.131 --> 1:07:51.331
Want to come in?

1:08:02.344 --> 1:08:04.578
I was just...

1:08:06.382 --> 1:08:08.515
You want a coffee?

1:08:08.517 --> 1:08:10.717
Do you like tea?

1:08:19.361 --> 1:08:21.462
This is the proper stuff.

1:08:21.464 --> 1:08:24.264
Only the best for you.

1:08:24.266 --> 1:08:26.567
You're damn right.

1:08:41.450 --> 1:08:45.319
So did you find
what you wanted in Hanoi?

1:08:51.327 --> 1:08:53.861
I thought of something
about me to tell you.

1:08:53.863 --> 1:08:56.230
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1:08:57.833 --> 1:08:59.733
After I quit my job...

1:08:59.735 --> 1:09:01.401
I took dance classes.

1:09:01.403 --> 1:09:03.704
No way, fuck off!

1:09:04.406 --> 1:09:06.540
Don't laugh.

1:09:08.210 --> 1:09:10.744
Hip Hop 4 Hope was what
the classes were called.

1:09:32.801 --> 1:09:34.701
Thank you.

1:09:47.917 --> 1:09:49.716
Tell me about your dad.

1:09:56.292 --> 1:10:00.394
Three years and five months ago,
he shot himself.

1:10:02.665 --> 1:10:04.798
I went back home
to pick up the pieces.

1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:06.366
I took my mom with me.

1:10:06.368 --> 1:10:10.837
And I had this king-size
oscillating pain.

1:10:10.839 --> 1:10:12.873
I got sciatica across here.

1:10:12.875 --> 1:10:15.342
It keeps...

1:10:18.414 --> 1:10:21.281
I couldn't listen to music
on my headphones.

1:10:21.283 --> 1:10:23.217
It triggered the pain.

1:10:23.219 --> 1:10:25.986
They gave me Tramadol.
You know it?

1:10:25.988 --> 1:10:27.688
No.

1:10:27.690 --> 1:10:29.690
It numbs you all over.

1:10:29.692 --> 1:10:31.959
You could pinch me,
stick a pin in me...

1:10:31.961 --> 1:10:34.861
I wouldn't feel a thing.

1:10:34.863 --> 1:10:37.864
If you drink a beer on that,
my God!

1:10:37.866 --> 1:10:40.701
It sends you up to the stars.

1:10:40.703 --> 1:10:42.636
It's stunning.

1:10:46.375 --> 1:10:49.676
- Do you still have it?
- Sometimes.

1:10:52.548 --> 1:10:54.481
Not here, though.

1:10:54.483 --> 1:10:57.417
I think it's something to do
with the humidity.

1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:00.554
Is that why you're here?

1:11:00.556 --> 1:11:02.756
My old man fought here.

1:11:06.996 --> 1:11:08.695
18 months.

1:11:08.697 --> 1:11:12.266
Three operations and 20 pieces
of rocket shrapnel later,

1:11:12.268 --> 1:11:13.600
he was discharged.

1:11:13.602 --> 1:11:16.903
And sent back home
to begin his life again.

1:11:18.941 --> 1:11:22.042
In debriefing,
the army psychiatrist says,

1:11:22.044 --> 1:11:26.380
"I see in your file
you have confirmed kills.

1:11:26.382 --> 1:11:28.882
Does that make you want
to kill other people?"

1:11:28.884 --> 1:11:31.785
He said, "No."

1:11:31.787 --> 1:11:35.055
"Good.
That is all I wanted to hear.

1:11:35.057 --> 1:11:37.557
You're dismissed."

1:11:38.661 --> 1:11:41.628
Back into the world.

1:11:41.630 --> 1:11:43.897
Back on the streets.

1:12:12.728 --> 1:12:14.928
Was this the temple we went to?

1:12:15.597 --> 1:12:17.097
Yes.

1:12:17.099 --> 1:12:19.766
All our families are there.

1:12:19.768 --> 1:12:22.703
Do you remember this,
when this picture was taken?

1:12:29.345 --> 1:12:31.411
I'm gonna look at them properly
later.

1:12:31.413 --> 1:12:32.946
Thank you.

1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:40.587
Cam on.

1:12:49.498 --> 1:12:51.465
How's your business?

1:12:51.834 --> 1:12:53.600
It's OK.

1:12:56.405 --> 1:12:58.605
How are you financially?

1:13:01.477 --> 1:13:03.677
Yes. Fine.

1:13:03.679 --> 1:13:05.912
They say when a country
becomes wealthy,

1:13:05.914 --> 1:13:10.050
the first three things that
people buy are a mobile phone,

1:13:10.052 --> 1:13:11.952
a flat-screen TV and a fridge.

1:13:11.954 --> 1:13:14.788
All in that order.

1:13:14.790 --> 1:13:16.890
I will be a very rich man.

1:13:17.526 --> 1:13:19.159
Super rich.

1:13:21.597 --> 1:13:23.964
Kit...

1:13:23.966 --> 1:13:26.099
..I can't give you
the money now.

1:13:26.101 --> 1:13:27.901
I don't have enough.

1:13:27.903 --> 1:13:30.170
I will have in three months.

1:13:31.440 --> 1:13:33.573
What money?

1:13:33.575 --> 1:13:37.577
Your mum loaned us
a lot of money for my shop.

1:13:41.483 --> 1:13:43.116
That was hers.

1:13:43.118 --> 1:13:45.519
You don't want it back?

1:13:46.155 --> 1:13:48.155
No.

1:13:57.499 --> 1:13:59.533
You know...

1:13:59.535 --> 1:14:02.102
back then...

1:14:02.104 --> 1:14:05.105
the most urgent question
for us...

1:14:05.107 --> 1:14:07.841
..was when and where
can we emigrate to.

1:14:10.579 --> 1:14:13.013
We applied for Australia...

1:14:13.782 --> 1:14:15.816
..America...

1:14:16.985 --> 1:14:19.786
We didn't get accepted.

1:14:19.788 --> 1:14:22.522
Your mother tried to help us
move to England.

1:14:22.524 --> 1:14:25.058
But...

1:14:25.060 --> 1:14:27.461
..we were not direct relatives.

1:14:29.164 --> 1:14:31.231
Impossible.

1:14:31.233 --> 1:14:32.999
I didn't know that.

1:14:33.001 --> 1:14:37.037
We thought of using the money
to make fake documents.

1:14:39.942 --> 1:14:42.876
I could be your brother...

1:14:42.878 --> 1:14:45.846
..my mother
could be your auntie.

1:14:49.618 --> 1:14:52.619
So why didn't you?

1:14:52.621 --> 1:14:54.855
We have the shop now.

1:14:58.727 --> 1:15:02.028
Did you find
your parents' home... in Hanoi?

1:15:02.764 --> 1:15:04.164
I did.

1:15:04.166 --> 1:15:06.666
Will you rest them there?

1:15:12.808 --> 1:15:14.708
I really don't know.

1:15:16.778 --> 1:15:20.146
You look... in pain.

1:15:29.625 --> 1:15:32.158
They went through
so much to leave here.

1:15:34.963 --> 1:15:36.997
And now you bring them back.

1:15:37.021 --> 1:21:20.573
