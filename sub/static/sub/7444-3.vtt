It's a jungle out there.

00:36.621 --> 00:38.339
It's a jungle out there.

01:08.021 --> 01:09.466
This isn't gonna work, man.

01:09.501 --> 01:12.701
You never know.
Might get away with it.

01:12.736 --> 01:13.656
Gus!

01:14.781 --> 01:16.214
Gus, how are you?

01:17.421 --> 01:19.186
Since when have youse been sailors?

01:19.221 --> 01:22.701
Well, let's just say we're
expanding our investment portfolio.

01:22.736 --> 01:23.666
Yeah...

01:23.701 --> 01:26.061
Thought you were going in the clink
for starting a riot.

01:26.096 --> 01:27.586
Me? You kidding, Gus?

01:27.621 --> 01:29.626
I'm as clean as a whistle.

01:29.661 --> 01:31.746
Coldie, mate?
No, no. What do youse want?

01:31.781 --> 01:34.781
Were you aware that a mate of yours
is being targeted by the jacks?

01:34.816 --> 01:36.901
They're gonna shut him down
any second.

01:36.936 --> 01:39.666
Who?
Alright, alright.

01:39.701 --> 01:42.626
This is straight from the horse's
mouth. The bent cop we know.

01:42.661 --> 01:45.821
He seems to think it's that mate of
yours who supplies the pill presses.

01:45.856 --> 01:48.781
What did he say his name was, Mark?
So you wanna know my supplier.

01:48.816 --> 01:50.746
You want the name
of the only bloke in town

01:50.781 --> 01:52.781
who's gonna lay his hands
on a quality pill press.

01:52.816 --> 01:54.546
Hey! We're trying
to do you a favour.

01:54.581 --> 01:57.261
No, no. You're trying to rip me off,
you cheeky little cocksucker.

01:57.296 --> 01:59.866
Gus, why would
I try to rip you off?

01:59.901 --> 02:02.301
This is the way it is, mate, hey?
Hey, hey!

02:02.336 --> 02:04.518
You want a pill press,
you speak to me.

02:04.553 --> 02:06.666
And I speak to my bloke
and he sources it.

02:06.701 --> 02:09.661
I deliver, you pay, I take a cut
and pass on the balance.

02:09.696 --> 02:10.786
Sounds good. Yeah.

02:10.821 --> 02:14.341
So you repeat after me -
I AM a cheeky little cocksucker.

02:14.376 --> 02:16.861
Mark,
get this fucker off me.

02:16.896 --> 02:18.861
Don't do it.

02:20.341 --> 02:23.697
Fuck!

02:24.741 --> 02:25.786
Fuck!

02:25.821 --> 02:27.986
You owe me a new phone, you fuck!

02:28.021 --> 02:30.330
Yeah, might have that
beer now, mate, eh?

02:34.381 --> 02:37.541
Hey! Take it easy,
you clumsy dickhead.

02:37.576 --> 02:38.974
Who you calling dickhead?

02:41.581 --> 02:43.501
Jase...
We paid a fortune for this thing.

02:43.536 --> 02:45.386
I don't want these guys
to fuck it up.

02:45.421 --> 02:47.701
Relax, will you? This'll be
the best cash we've ever spent.

02:47.736 --> 02:49.146
80 fucking grand.

02:49.181 --> 02:51.981
We are going to make
fucking truckloads of eccys.

02:52.016 --> 02:53.786
This thing will be
a licence to print money.

02:53.821 --> 02:56.061
Well, not till we find ourselves
a cook, it won't be.

02:56.096 --> 02:58.021
I will find one.
I can cook.

02:58.056 --> 02:59.546
What?

02:59.581 --> 03:02.061
Ecstasy and that.
I know how to make it.

03:02.096 --> 03:04.506
Since when?
Just one of my many talents.

03:04.541 --> 03:07.021
Well, along with driving
and eating, that makes three.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.906
No, come on, give me a shot.

03:08.941 --> 03:10.586
Happy, Gus?
Yeah, mate.

03:10.621 --> 03:13.041
Alright. Come on,
time to sink some piss, eh?

03:13.076 --> 03:15.461
No can do, mate. Trace's
bringing the kid around.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.546
So?

03:16.581 --> 03:18.301
Reckons I don't spend
enough time with him.

03:18.336 --> 03:19.901
She's got you pussy-whipped, mate.

03:19.936 --> 03:21.573
Yeah. Fuck her.

03:23.501 --> 03:25.093
Daddy, I'm here!

03:27.221 --> 03:28.654
Sidney!

03:32.781 --> 03:34.214
I'm sure he won't be long.

03:35.261 --> 03:37.666
He forgot.

03:37.701 --> 03:40.226
Daddy wouldn't have
forgotten you, Tommy.

03:40.261 --> 03:44.015
I'm sure wherever he is, it was
something he couldn't get out of.

03:45.061 --> 03:48.701
Tracey Seymour was
once married to a biker called Sid -

03:48.736 --> 03:50.146
an outlaw biker,

03:50.181 --> 03:51.853
and that was his great appeal.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.181
Hi.
What's your name?

03:55.216 --> 03:56.626
Tracey.

03:56.661 --> 03:59.706
You're good. You're SO good.

03:59.741 --> 04:02.261
The daughter
of a Baptist minister,

04:02.296 --> 04:04.346
Tracey was fascinated by bad boys

04:04.381 --> 04:07.261
and the badder they were,
the better she liked them.

04:07.296 --> 04:10.106
But when her son Tom
got old enough to ask questions,

04:10.141 --> 04:13.441
she knew the time had come to
make a break and forge a new life.

04:13.476 --> 04:16.741
Yeah, you'll get your money,
like I said you'll get it.

04:16.776 --> 04:19.386
What? Get fucked!

04:19.421 --> 04:23.255
Pfft! That arsehole I got the press from
reckons I'm gonna rip him off.

04:26.061 --> 04:27.626
What's his name again?

04:27.661 --> 04:29.786
Len Kerr. What,
didn't you have the pleasure?

04:29.821 --> 04:33.341
The trouble was Tracey's
old life kept snapping at her heels.

04:33.376 --> 04:35.781
Won't stop me going
round there, but.

04:35.816 --> 04:37.226
Teaching him some manners.

04:37.261 --> 04:39.386
Shouldn't bloody pay him at all,
the mad bastard.

04:39.421 --> 04:42.541
So, what do you get
when you take a not-very-bright biker,

04:42.576 --> 04:45.221
add three litres of beer
and a handful of amphetamines?

04:45.256 --> 04:47.866
Who gets him all his
fucking customers? We do.

04:47.901 --> 04:50.415
Someone ought to knock
the cheek out of that prick.

04:51.861 --> 04:53.581
Ought to knock him, period.

04:53.616 --> 04:55.117
Disaster.

04:55.152 --> 04:56.619
That's what you get.

05:09.061 --> 05:10.494
Len Kerr?

05:12.341 --> 05:14.377
What the fuck?

05:16.341 --> 05:17.960
Anton, what the hell?

05:17.995 --> 05:19.579
Shit! You Len Kerr?

05:21.221 --> 05:23.212
Are you Len Kerr?

05:47.661 --> 05:49.701
Jason Moran
is a violent little turd

05:49.736 --> 05:51.146
who needs to be behind bars.

05:51.181 --> 05:53.221
You're wasting your time.
I'm wasting my time?

05:53.256 --> 05:55.416
I mean, look...

05:57.261 --> 05:59.261
...there's no bloody point
in going to all the expense

05:59.296 --> 06:01.146
of taking Jason to trial

06:01.181 --> 06:02.941
if we haven't even got a single witness.

06:02.976 --> 06:04.426
Well, we've still got one left.

06:04.461 --> 06:06.781
Gonna track down this
Campbell Lawler bloke.

06:06.816 --> 06:09.066
What, the African?
Didn't he bugger off home?

06:09.101 --> 06:12.141
Yeah, but there can't be too many
Lawlers in the Swaziland phonebook,

06:12.176 --> 06:13.106
can there?

06:13.141 --> 06:14.786
You're a sucker for
punishment, mate.

06:14.821 --> 06:17.941
Anyway, you're still short
of physical evidence.

06:17.976 --> 06:19.426
Oh, I am, am I?

06:19.461 --> 06:22.761
Because you've all of a sudden
retired from this case, have you?

06:22.796 --> 06:26.026
I just don't believe in beating
my head against a brick wall, OK?

06:26.061 --> 06:29.221
I'm thinking about the coat that
Jason was wearing that night as well.

06:29.256 --> 06:30.700
Yeah, what about it?

06:32.221 --> 06:33.921
This is a fucking home invasion.

06:33.956 --> 06:35.621
One approved by a magistrate.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.054
Brendan!

06:38.261 --> 06:39.706
What are you doing with my coat?

06:39.741 --> 06:41.741
You see, I noticed on
the King Street security tape

06:41.776 --> 06:43.221
that your coat was kind of snazzy.

06:43.256 --> 06:44.666
So I thought maybe you hadn't

06:44.701 --> 06:47.090
thrown it out with the rest
of your gear from that night.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.146
'Zegna'. Now, that's a top designer.

06:50.181 --> 06:52.501
A designer duffel coat!
You are a stylish fellow.

06:52.536 --> 06:53.946
Pure merino too.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.541
Jeez, it must have been hot,
bashing up all those people.

06:56.576 --> 06:58.266
You jacks have got nothing, huh?

06:58.301 --> 07:00.746
You're shit!
Thanks for your cooperation, Jase.

07:00.781 --> 07:03.181
What, is that it, is it?
You just came for the jacket?

07:03.216 --> 07:04.861
Oh, see you later,
Detective Sphincter.

07:04.896 --> 07:06.341
Means 'arsehole', remember?

07:06.376 --> 07:08.059
Get a real job, Carl.

07:10.701 --> 07:12.134
Why are you always eating?

07:28.781 --> 07:30.214
Surprise.

07:31.741 --> 07:33.981
Yellow's your favourite, right?

07:34.016 --> 07:35.653
What do you want?

07:36.741 --> 07:39.121
How's Tom?
OK, considering.

07:39.156 --> 07:41.466
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.

07:41.501 --> 07:43.626
How many times you going
to let him down, Sidney?

07:43.661 --> 07:46.221
Couldn't help it. Look, I'm gonna
make it up to him, alright?

07:46.256 --> 07:48.426
I'm gonna buy him a minibike.
Don't you get it?

07:48.461 --> 07:51.061
He doesn't want things.
He wants to spend time with you.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.586
He was gutted!

07:52.621 --> 07:55.066
Christ, I'm here now, aren't I?
Yeah, OK.

07:55.101 --> 07:58.277
Well, Tom's asleep now,
but maybe next weekend.

07:58.312 --> 08:01.454
He's playing soccer
and he'd love you to watch.

08:02.901 --> 08:04.381
What if I stay here tonight?

08:04.416 --> 08:05.826
What?!

08:05.861 --> 08:09.541
Could be a nice surprise for Tom
if I wake up here in the morning.

08:09.576 --> 08:12.221
Oh, goodnight, Sidney.
I need to stay here, Trace.

08:12.256 --> 08:14.658
I had a run-in with my housemate.
Go to Gus.

08:14.693 --> 08:17.026
I'm sure he'd give you
a piece of floor.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.301
What have you been up to?
Look, can I come in?

08:19.336 --> 08:21.610
I don't think that's a good idea!
Please!

08:24.901 --> 08:27.051
Tell me you didn't really do this.

08:29.021 --> 08:30.941
First bloke should have
kept his head down.

08:30.976 --> 08:32.374
Oh, Jesus.

08:33.421 --> 08:35.660
Stupid prick should have said something
instead of standing there.

08:35.696 --> 08:37.106
Don't tell me any more.

08:37.140 --> 08:39.866
Fuckin' serves 'em right,
both of them.

08:39.900 --> 08:42.666
Dense bloody grease monkeys.
Don't involve us.

08:42.701 --> 08:46.261
I dropped me gun. You know,
that old one that I bought in WA?

08:46.296 --> 08:47.706
Shut up, you bloody idiot!

08:47.741 --> 08:49.666
Just shut up!
What's got up your nose?

08:49.701 --> 08:52.226
You kill two people
and then you come here?

08:52.261 --> 08:55.901
Don't you know how hard I've tried
to protect Tom from all this crap?

08:55.936 --> 08:56.946
Protect him?

08:56.981 --> 09:00.181
I've given him a normal life!
I've made sure he's safe, secure...

09:00.216 --> 09:01.821
Who are you fucking kidding, Tracey!

09:01.856 --> 09:03.346
You work in a topless bar.

09:03.381 --> 09:06.100
You screwed Jason Moran
and Alphonse Gangitano!

09:10.941 --> 09:12.746
Look, you going to
help me out or what?

09:12.781 --> 09:15.861
Typical. Now, when you're in the shit,
you remember we exist.

09:15.896 --> 09:18.426
Can you just give me a break
for five minutes?

09:18.461 --> 09:22.221
I can't believe you used Tom
as an excuse for coming here.

09:22.256 --> 09:24.501
Well, he's my son,
as you keep reminding me.

09:24.536 --> 09:25.946
You don't deserve him!

09:25.981 --> 09:28.381
You don't give a rat's about him
except when it suits you.

09:28.416 --> 09:29.626
Mummy?

09:29.661 --> 09:32.026
Hello, Tommy.
Hello, Daddy.

09:32.061 --> 09:34.441
How are you going, mate?
I got a new game.

09:34.476 --> 09:36.821
Is that right?
Well, I'd love to play it.

09:36.856 --> 09:38.254
Can I turn it on?

09:40.821 --> 09:42.661
Don't know whether I'm allowed
to stay over, mate.

09:42.696 --> 09:45.175
He can sleep in my room. Please!

09:50.661 --> 09:52.181
I wanted a woman.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.666
A woman?

09:53.701 --> 09:55.866
Uh, yeah, in Homicide.

09:55.901 --> 09:58.426
I requested
a female... female officer

09:58.461 --> 10:01.621
because people management's
not our strong suit

10:01.656 --> 10:04.781
and I thought a female
might help redress that.

10:04.816 --> 10:06.946
People management?

10:06.981 --> 10:09.146
Yes, witnesses, specifically.
Mm-hm.

10:09.181 --> 10:12.521
They're our strongest asset,
far and above any physical evidence,

10:12.556 --> 10:15.861
and at times we... we haven't
been that good at managing them.

10:15.896 --> 10:19.410
Your desk is down there
and, um, this is my office here.

10:20.541 --> 10:21.974
Come in.

10:23.021 --> 10:24.626
Sit down and... and welcome.

10:24.661 --> 10:28.301
I've got to say, Sergeant,
I'm stoked to be here, I really am.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.941
Well, I'll take that as a positive.
And you should call me 'boss'.

10:31.976 --> 10:35.061
The other men... the other detectives
call me 'boss'.

10:35.096 --> 10:38.901
Are you familiar with
the phrase 'PTT'?

10:38.936 --> 10:41.786
I know about PMT.

10:41.821 --> 10:46.501
Uh, PTT stands for 'Professionalism,
Thoroughness and Tenacity'.

10:46.536 --> 10:48.341
They're our code words
here at Homicide,

10:48.376 --> 10:49.821
and that's what I expect from you.

10:49.856 --> 10:50.786
Sure.

10:50.821 --> 10:53.361
The dictionary might
not agree, but to me,

10:53.396 --> 10:55.901
the word 'homicide'
means 'search for truth'.

10:55.936 --> 10:57.971
I want you to think about that.

11:01.181 --> 11:02.661
Do you like shortbread?

11:02.696 --> 11:05.426
Shortbread? Uh...

11:05.461 --> 11:09.061
Yes, I bake them myself.
It's... it's a hobby.

11:09.096 --> 11:10.494
Thanks.

11:13.021 --> 11:14.454
Your first case.

11:16.261 --> 11:19.361
Leonard Kerr and Anton Young.
You might have heard about them.

11:19.396 --> 11:22.461
They're two guys who were shot
down in a garage in Port Melbourne.

11:22.496 --> 11:24.941
May be gang-related
or it could be a robbery gone wrong.

11:24.976 --> 11:28.586
You're on it with Peter Brownlow.
Good luck.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.279
And that was
my introduction to Homicide -

11:31.314 --> 11:33.938
a Luger pistol
and a piece of baked shortbread.

11:57.221 --> 11:59.018
Wanna be Mario this time?

12:00.221 --> 12:01.746
Dad has to go.

12:01.781 --> 12:03.851
But we've only had one game.
He has to go.

12:05.461 --> 12:07.053
Don't be such a hard-arse, Trace.

12:10.261 --> 12:11.976
Who's that?

12:12.011 --> 12:13.692
I'll go.

12:21.461 --> 12:22.894
Tracey Seymour?

12:24.061 --> 12:27.821
Senior Detective James,
Brownlow, St Kilda Homicide.

12:27.856 --> 12:29.266
We're making enquiries

12:29.301 --> 12:31.346
about the whereabouts
of a Mr Sidney Martin.

12:31.381 --> 12:34.381
He's not at his address, but we were
told you were married to him.

12:34.416 --> 12:36.586
Yes, I WAS.

12:36.621 --> 12:38.237
Know where
we could find him?

12:38.272 --> 12:39.853
Wow, Dad, that was great!

12:41.541 --> 12:43.816
He's, um, here.

12:45.501 --> 12:46.986
Sidney!

12:47.021 --> 12:48.454
What?

12:50.101 --> 12:54.261
Senior Detective James, Mr Martin.
St Kilda Homicide.

12:54.296 --> 12:56.221
Tom, go watch TV in the lounge.

12:56.256 --> 12:57.654
Me and Dad were...
Now!

13:00.581 --> 13:02.651
Uh, Mr Martin,
do you own a Luger pistol?

13:04.461 --> 13:05.906
Yeah.

13:05.941 --> 13:09.501
Do you know where it is now?
It's been stolen.

13:09.536 --> 13:12.581
Stolen?
From the pannier on my bike.

13:12.616 --> 13:14.858
Lifted while I was at the pub.

13:14.893 --> 13:17.077
Right. What pub?
I forget.

13:17.112 --> 13:19.226
When?
Few weeks ago.

13:19.261 --> 13:21.621
Did you report it?
Couldn't be bothered.

13:21.656 --> 13:23.946
It's not like you guys would find it.

13:23.981 --> 13:27.421
Well, we have. We believe
it was a weapon used in two murders.

13:27.456 --> 13:29.586
I wouldn't know anything about that.

13:29.621 --> 13:32.301
Where were you at 3pm
yesterday, Mr Martin?

13:32.336 --> 13:33.781
I was riding.

13:33.816 --> 13:35.666
Alone?

13:35.701 --> 13:38.021
Nup. I was with Tracey.

13:38.056 --> 13:39.466
Where did you go?

13:39.501 --> 13:43.026
Uh, in town, over the bridge...

13:43.061 --> 13:46.781
Did you stop for petrol or a snack?
Nope.

13:46.816 --> 13:48.546
See anyone?
Nuh.

13:48.581 --> 13:51.781
Which roads did you use?
I forget.

13:51.816 --> 13:54.136
Do you remember, Ms Seymour?

14:03.941 --> 14:05.374
You don't mind, do you?

14:07.301 --> 14:10.181
You saw they were after me.
I had to say something.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.506
Sidney, at three o'clock
yesterday afternoon

14:12.541 --> 14:15.533
I was at Tom's school
discussing a bloody cake stall.

14:17.221 --> 14:19.546
Right. Who with? I'll have a word.

14:19.581 --> 14:22.541
How many people
do you expect to lie for you?

14:22.576 --> 14:24.099
You fucking let 'em in!

14:25.661 --> 14:27.417
Go away.

14:27.452 --> 14:29.174
Go away!

14:39.501 --> 14:41.706
Forensics found
no recoverable DNA

14:41.741 --> 14:45.973
on the lapels, the collar,
the front, the sleeve, the hem.

14:47.021 --> 14:48.818
Jason's had the bloody thing
dry-cleaned!

14:49.861 --> 14:53.251
And the last of his victims
is somewhere in Swaziland.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.700
You jacks have got nothing, huh?
You're shit!

15:07.341 --> 15:10.219
I just don't believe in
beating my head against a brick wall.

15:11.381 --> 15:13.461
I'll see you later,
Detective Sphincter.

15:13.496 --> 15:14.894
It means 'arsehole', remember?

15:16.061 --> 15:17.906
Steve?

15:17.941 --> 15:19.374
Yeah, in here.

15:22.581 --> 15:26.781
Guess who's just been attached
to the QBE account?

15:26.816 --> 15:28.226
The big one?

15:28.261 --> 15:31.121
Yeah, one of our partners just asked
if I'd be interested.

15:31.156 --> 15:33.981
Interested? I thought I'd have to
be there like five years

15:34.016 --> 15:35.414
before I got a chance like this.

15:37.101 --> 15:38.056
Well done.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.454
Shitty day, babe?

15:44.821 --> 15:49.815
Why don't we open this
and see if tonight gets any better?

15:52.141 --> 15:53.574
Might get you laid.

15:59.021 --> 16:00.626
When the Morans
and their mates

16:00.661 --> 16:03.026
discovered Steve's DNA tests
had drawn a blank

16:03.061 --> 16:07.461
and that Jason was effectively
in the clear, they threw a party.

16:07.496 --> 16:09.541
Not that they condoned
his violent behaviour -

16:09.576 --> 16:11.621
they just hated
the police getting a win.

16:16.221 --> 16:18.621
Alright, alright, a bit of
shush, please, a bit of shush.

16:18.656 --> 16:20.106
Hey! Mario.

16:20.141 --> 16:22.701
I just want to drink
to my son, Jason.

16:22.736 --> 16:24.146
Heads held high, fellas.

16:24.181 --> 16:26.561
Here's to your innocence
and the right result!

16:26.596 --> 16:28.941
Laughin' like a shark, Dad.
Laughin' like a shark.

16:28.976 --> 16:31.330
Jason!

16:35.501 --> 16:37.021
Nice to win a round.

16:37.056 --> 16:39.266
Well, you know.

16:39.301 --> 16:41.186
Boxing above my weight, Mick.

16:41.221 --> 16:43.226
Might be time to move up a division.

16:43.261 --> 16:46.381
Well, Jason, not all the decisions
you make are going to go your way.

16:46.416 --> 16:49.976
I mean, eventually, the points,
they stack up against you.

16:51.861 --> 16:54.186
But any more big match-ups,

16:54.221 --> 16:56.141
I'd appreciate it
that you dealt with it

16:56.176 --> 16:59.178
in a more gentlemanly manner.

17:00.781 --> 17:03.341
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

17:05.261 --> 17:06.853
A little less of this...

17:07.941 --> 17:09.374
<i>... and a bit more of this.</i>

17:11.340 --> 17:13.218
Sure, Mick, yeah. Sure.

17:21.381 --> 17:22.859
Excuse me, ladies.

17:25.421 --> 17:28.421
Oh, your fat arses are stuck
to their chairs, are they?

17:28.455 --> 17:29.946
Where are you going, Roberta?

17:29.981 --> 17:32.861
I'm going to the fuckin' dunny.
Do you want to come and watch?

17:34.701 --> 17:37.901
Nobody ever called
Roberta Stevens a shrinking violet.

17:37.936 --> 17:40.861
But Carl Williams
didn't care about her mouth.

17:40.896 --> 17:43.421
He knew he'd found his princess.

17:43.456 --> 17:45.157
Buy you a drink?

17:45.192 --> 17:46.858
Already got one.

17:49.341 --> 17:50.774
So, how do you fit in?

17:51.821 --> 17:53.741
Married to that fuckin'
loser mate of Jason's

17:53.776 --> 17:55.466
with the nose like a fuckin' samosa.

17:55.501 --> 17:57.666
Though I'm the fuckin' loser
that fell pregnant to him.

17:57.701 --> 18:02.501
Wouldn't say I'm in, but,
not with those up-themselves bitches.

18:02.536 --> 18:03.934
Yeah, I noticed.

18:05.421 --> 18:07.421
Well, what about you?
You just here getting shit-faced?

18:07.456 --> 18:09.571
No, no, I do a bit
for Jase and Mark.

18:11.141 --> 18:12.574
Toady boy, huh?

18:14.101 --> 18:17.021
It's how far up you climb that counts,
not where you start.

18:17.056 --> 18:19.421
And just where are
you going to end up...

18:19.456 --> 18:20.866
...whatever your name is?

18:20.901 --> 18:24.617
I'm going to be a bloke
that makes so much dough

18:24.652 --> 18:28.334
I can buy a chick like you
whatever she wants.

18:29.461 --> 18:31.611
I'm Carl. Carl Williams.

18:36.381 --> 18:38.941
Now, how about that drink?

18:38.976 --> 18:41.218
Go on, pick one. Anything.

18:41.253 --> 18:43.426
Blue one.
The blue one?

18:43.461 --> 18:46.021
Hey, bartender, pretty drink
for a pretty girl.

18:46.056 --> 18:47.454
Coming right up, mate.

19:07.461 --> 19:09.921
Hello?
Guess what I'm doing.

19:09.956 --> 19:12.168
How'd you get this number?

19:12.203 --> 19:14.346
You gave it to me, dimbo.

19:14.381 --> 19:18.301
I'm vacuuming, in stilettos, nude.

19:18.336 --> 19:20.786
Nude. Nude.

19:20.821 --> 19:22.786
Can't hear no vacuum cleaner.

19:22.821 --> 19:25.061
Oh, it's a real flash one. It purrs.

19:25.096 --> 19:27.381
And I purr too, Carl.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.066
And yowl.

19:29.101 --> 19:34.501
And go ohh... Ohh!

19:34.536 --> 19:37.506
Aghhh!

19:37.541 --> 19:39.306
Hey, fat boy!

19:39.341 --> 19:40.821
No personal calls on company time.

19:40.856 --> 19:42.266
Back to work.
Yeah, sorry, Jase.

19:42.301 --> 19:44.741
You still working for the Morans?
I've got to go, Mum.

19:44.776 --> 19:46.741
You said
you were gonna be a big man.

19:46.776 --> 19:48.866
I'II, um, call you later, OK?

19:48.901 --> 19:50.493
No, don't bother till you're rich.

19:54.501 --> 19:56.651
Hey, back to work!

20:01.661 --> 20:03.346
I've told you everything.

20:03.381 --> 20:05.306
You and Sidney been split a while?

20:05.341 --> 20:07.181
You certainly didn't seem
that comfortable around him.

20:07.216 --> 20:08.661
Just don't see him that much.

20:08.696 --> 20:10.106
Seems a good dad.

20:10.141 --> 20:12.066
He's not going to win
Father of the Year.

20:12.101 --> 20:14.146
That night was the first
we'd seen him in months.

20:14.181 --> 20:17.221
That night? I thought you were
riding with him all afternoon?

20:17.256 --> 20:19.586
We didn't get home till late.
I see.

20:19.621 --> 20:22.661
You know we have information
that puts him at the crime scene.

20:22.696 --> 20:24.226
Oh, why bother with me, then?

20:24.261 --> 20:25.906
Because if you keep up this story,

20:25.941 --> 20:27.776
you could end up
being charged with perjury.

20:27.811 --> 20:29.612
We'd hate to have to
bring your son into this.

20:35.821 --> 20:38.381
What's your name again?
Jacqui.

20:38.416 --> 20:40.426
Jacqui.

20:40.461 --> 20:43.066
Sid did come over.
When?

20:43.101 --> 20:45.331
What was he doing before that?

20:46.381 --> 20:48.221
Did he say why he'd come over?

20:48.256 --> 20:50.226
He wanted to see Tom.

20:50.261 --> 20:52.226
What, for the first time in months?

20:52.261 --> 20:55.541
Only hours after two men
were shot with his gun?

20:55.576 --> 20:58.453
Is there nothing more
you wanna tell me?

21:00.101 --> 21:02.761
I looked up your record.
Oh, good for you.

21:02.796 --> 21:05.148
Had multiple arrests,
you've done time,

21:05.183 --> 21:07.501
but for the past
five years, nothing.

21:07.536 --> 21:09.173
Has something changed?

21:10.661 --> 21:12.261
Was it having Tom?

21:12.296 --> 21:13.826
Leave me alone.

21:13.861 --> 21:15.931
He's a beautiful little boy.

21:17.661 --> 21:19.538
Does he know what his dad did?

21:22.141 --> 21:24.296
Both of the guys Sidney murdered
had kids too

21:24.331 --> 21:26.452
and they're never
gonna see their fathers again.

21:28.021 --> 21:31.186
I know you want
what's best for your son.

21:31.221 --> 21:35.501
So just tell the truth, make a statement
and give evidence in court.

21:35.536 --> 21:38.220
You've got no idea
what you're asking...

21:39.261 --> 21:41.901
<i>... no idea what they could do to me.</i>

21:41.936 --> 21:43.386
We can look after you.

21:43.421 --> 21:45.616
We'll put you and Tom
into witness protection.

21:46.661 --> 21:49.621
Come on, Tracey,
just talk to me.

21:49.656 --> 21:50.586
I can't.

21:50.621 --> 21:52.706
If you let Sidney get away with this,

21:52.741 --> 21:56.101
then one day Tom is going to find out
that his dad is a double murderer

21:56.136 --> 21:58.746
and that you think that's OK.

21:58.781 --> 22:00.861
'Cause that's what
lying for him does, Tracey -

22:00.896 --> 22:03.393
it tells him
that you think that's OK.

22:03.428 --> 22:05.891
And your son
is gonna learn that from you.

22:26.581 --> 22:28.617
You been talking to the cops again?

22:31.701 --> 22:33.657
What'd you tell 'em?

22:34.701 --> 22:36.381
Nothing yet.

22:36.416 --> 22:37.530
Good.

22:39.181 --> 22:41.346
Look, I don't wanna
pressure you or nothing,

22:41.381 --> 22:43.861
but me, Gus and the guys,
we kind of stick together.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.906
What's that supposed to mean?

22:45.941 --> 22:48.741
You take on one of us,
you take on all of us.

22:48.776 --> 22:50.541
You're threatening me?

22:50.576 --> 22:53.906
Nah.

22:53.941 --> 22:56.141
I'm just telling you
how it is, babe.

22:56.176 --> 22:58.701
Looking after your future.

24:00.101 --> 24:02.012
What's wrong, Mummy?

24:03.061 --> 24:06.610
Tom, we're gonna go on a holiday.

24:13.261 --> 24:15.546
So this is where they're hiding you.

24:15.581 --> 24:18.321
G'day. What are you doing
lurking around Homicide?

24:18.356 --> 24:21.061
Oh, I thought I'd just come down
and select a desk

24:21.096 --> 24:22.541
in case I get the call-up.

24:24.101 --> 24:25.946
I thought I'd just
come down and say g'day.

24:25.981 --> 24:28.821
How's your King Street thing going?
Still chasing Jason Moran?

24:28.856 --> 24:32.101
I swear I'm gonna call
my autobiography 'Chasin' Jason'.

24:32.136 --> 24:33.626
What about you, your double murder?

24:33.661 --> 24:36.781
It all hangs on one witness
and she won't talk.

24:36.816 --> 24:38.260
Tell me about it.

24:39.341 --> 24:41.741
Let's get out of here,
go down to the pub, drown our sorrows.

24:41.776 --> 24:42.706
Hang on.

24:42.741 --> 24:45.892
Homicide. Jacqui James.

24:48.101 --> 24:49.978
Yeah, no, no. That's fine, Tracey.

24:51.461 --> 24:52.426
Yep.

24:52.461 --> 24:54.258
So, where do we stand?

24:55.901 --> 24:57.466
Good girl.

24:57.501 --> 24:59.941
Can you come down to St Kilda Road
and make a statement?

24:59.976 --> 25:01.546
No, that's great.

25:01.581 --> 25:04.141
Yep. I'll see you then.

25:18.101 --> 25:19.586
Yes?

25:19.621 --> 25:21.066
Tracey Seymour.

25:21.101 --> 25:23.981
She knows what she's in for
giving evidence against her ex?

25:24.016 --> 25:25.426
She's as gutsy as all hell.

25:25.461 --> 25:27.581
I've seen witnesses
fall over at the last minute,

25:27.616 --> 25:29.501
rock-solid cases just turn to water.

25:29.536 --> 25:31.578
She's gonna do the right thing.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.586
I'd back her.
You'll need to.

25:33.621 --> 25:36.316
She'll need all the support
she can get.

25:36.351 --> 25:39.011
Let's get her into
Witness Security ASAP.

25:42.261 --> 25:43.819
Good work.

26:02.821 --> 26:04.254
On the ground!

26:06.221 --> 26:09.019
ON THE GROUND!

26:10.341 --> 26:11.786
On the ground!

26:11.821 --> 26:14.821
You're being charged with the murders
of Leonard Kerr and Anton Young.

26:39.941 --> 26:41.421
Here?
They're not fuckin' here.

26:41.456 --> 26:42.386
FUCK!

26:42.421 --> 26:44.501
Fuckin' bitch!

27:40.341 --> 27:42.621
Traces of dried blood
in both pockets.

27:42.656 --> 27:44.866
Remind me not to use
those drycleaners.

27:44.901 --> 27:47.146
Forensics pulled DNA
from four separate individuals,

27:47.181 --> 27:49.421
so this means we can prove
that Jason punched these people,

27:49.456 --> 27:50.918
shoved his hands in his pockets...

27:50.953 --> 27:52.346
No, he'll say
he never punched anyone

27:52.381 --> 27:55.021
and the blood got on his hands
as he ministered to their wounds.

27:55.056 --> 27:57.901
Oh, well, fu...
Steve, it's not a home run, mate.

27:57.936 --> 27:59.501
We still gotta get
one of those victims

27:59.536 --> 28:01.378
to stand up in court and ID Jase.

28:11.901 --> 28:13.459
Those for me?

28:19.341 --> 28:20.979
Very nice.

28:22.781 --> 28:24.546
But aren't you supposed to be a guy

28:24.581 --> 28:26.741
that can get a girl
whatever she wants?

28:26.776 --> 28:28.534
What do you want?

28:28.569 --> 28:30.293
What have you got?

28:31.501 --> 28:38.681
# The girl of my dreams
is giving me nightmares

28:38.716 --> 28:45.826
# I found her on TV,
now I see her everywhere

28:45.861 --> 28:52.901
# She's got style,
she's got violent ways about her

28:52.936 --> 28:59.461
# She got me so that
I can't dream without her

28:59.496 --> 29:03.118
# She's giving me nightmares

29:03.153 --> 29:06.747
# She's giving me
nightmares

29:06.782 --> 29:10.306
# She's giving me nightmares

29:10.341 --> 29:13.777
# She's giving me nightmares... #

29:15.861 --> 29:17.738
It's nice.

29:18.781 --> 29:21.661
Jason should get you one
of them chef hats and a frilly apron.

29:21.696 --> 29:24.421
I'm not gonna
be a shitkicker all my life.

29:24.456 --> 29:26.981
Yeah, so you keep saying.

29:31.421 --> 29:34.094
I'm doing my own presses, Roberta.

29:37.141 --> 29:38.654
You're using the Moran's rig?

29:39.701 --> 29:42.666
You fuckin' little hooter!

29:42.701 --> 29:45.218
You're not gonna tell 'em, are ya?
Tell 'em? Nuh.

29:45.253 --> 29:47.735
Nuh, I'll help you.
Let's send 'em fuckin' broke.

29:49.461 --> 29:53.010
You don't look like much,
but you got balls, haven't you?

29:54.901 --> 29:57.016
Carl Williams.

29:57.051 --> 29:59.132
Yeah.
Yeah.

30:01.301 --> 30:08.386
# My bedside is loaded,
my bedside's exploded

30:08.421 --> 30:12.026
# Hard to believe you can't get
what you're dreaming

30:12.061 --> 30:18.861
# If you try sometimes,
you might find you get what you steal

30:18.896 --> 30:24.341
# The girl of my dreams
is giving me nightmares... #

30:26.181 --> 30:32.741
# I don't know what it means,
but she's got multi-coloured hair... #

30:34.061 --> 30:38.221
# When she stands in the sand
I dream of peaches... #

30:40.021 --> 30:46.981
# And I'm not sure
what that means either

30:47.016 --> 30:50.578
# She's giving me nightmares

30:50.613 --> 30:53.957
# She's giving me
nightmares

30:53.992 --> 30:57.266
# She's giving me nightmares

30:57.301 --> 31:02.091
# She's giving me nightmares... #

31:03.981 --> 31:05.946
To protect Tracey
until Sid's trial,

31:05.981 --> 31:09.141
Witness Security hid them away
in a remote coastal town

31:09.176 --> 31:10.893
with an armed guard.

31:19.061 --> 31:20.494
G'day.

31:21.541 --> 31:24.706
Hey. I got your call. What's up?

31:24.741 --> 31:27.581
How about you go play
on the equipment for a bit, honey?

31:27.616 --> 31:29.106
No!
Go on.

31:29.141 --> 31:31.186
It's dumb. There's no monkey bars.

31:31.221 --> 31:33.381
Go to the camp store, then.
Get an ice-cream.

31:33.416 --> 31:35.541
Not if fartie-pants has to come.
Don't be rude!

31:35.576 --> 31:37.698
I hate Warrnambool!

31:37.733 --> 31:39.557
I hate this holiday!

31:39.592 --> 31:41.381
I wanna go home!

31:41.416 --> 31:43.178
Hello.

31:44.581 --> 31:45.546
Hello.

31:45.581 --> 31:47.856
Is Campbell Lawler there, please?

31:49.381 --> 31:50.866
Just a second.

31:50.901 --> 31:54.901
Hello? Campbell Lawler speaking.
Who is this, please?

31:54.936 --> 31:58.901
Mr Lawler, um, my name's
Senior Detective Stephen Owen

31:58.936 --> 32:00.826
from the Victoria Police
in Australia.

32:00.861 --> 32:03.701
Is this about the assault
in the nightclub?

32:03.736 --> 32:05.346
Yes. Yes, it is.

32:05.381 --> 32:09.061
Um, Mr Lawler, we were wondering
if you'd be able to return to Melbourne

32:09.096 --> 32:10.541
to identify your assailant.

32:10.576 --> 32:12.146
To Melbourne?

32:12.181 --> 32:15.781
I'm in Swaziland, Detective Owen.
It's a very long way.

32:15.816 --> 32:18.858
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can afford the airfare.

32:18.893 --> 32:21.901
Sir, if you're prepared
to come back to Australia,

32:21.936 --> 32:23.861
I'm sure the fare
would not be a problem.

32:23.896 --> 32:25.746
I would like to see justice done.

32:25.781 --> 32:29.946
If I can arrange
some time off my job, I'll do it.

32:29.981 --> 32:33.861
Um, look, I'll be in touch with you
in the next couple of days

32:33.896 --> 32:35.341
with more details, sir.

32:35.376 --> 32:36.774
Have a good day.

32:41.581 --> 32:43.026
Yes!

32:43.061 --> 32:45.814
Here's to us.
Thanks.

32:50.581 --> 32:55.421
Where's my fucking coat?
I'd like it back.

32:55.456 --> 32:57.412
You can wave to it at your trial.

32:58.461 --> 33:00.241
How's it going, princess?

33:00.276 --> 33:01.986
Suze, just ignore him.

33:02.021 --> 33:04.261
Is it good banging a corrupt cop?
He'll go away.

33:04.296 --> 33:06.141
I need to go to the bathroom.

33:06.176 --> 33:07.621
Look, it's fine.
No.

33:07.656 --> 33:09.101
Just...
Oi!

33:09.136 --> 33:10.101
Jase...

33:38.461 --> 33:41.501
Yay! Whoo-hoo!

33:41.536 --> 33:42.776
Whoo!

33:42.811 --> 33:44.016
Higher!

33:45.501 --> 33:46.666
Yay.

33:46.701 --> 33:48.339
Did you wanna see me
about the trial?

33:50.381 --> 33:52.561
Is there a problem
with your evidence?

33:52.596 --> 33:54.741
Do you think I'm going to pull out?

33:54.776 --> 33:57.546
Are you?
No.

33:57.581 --> 33:59.506
Well, what is it, then?

33:59.541 --> 34:02.866
You were right, you know.
About what?

34:02.901 --> 34:06.141
Knowing I was dragging Tom
into the crap was killing me.

34:06.176 --> 34:07.706
Yeah.

34:07.741 --> 34:10.661
For a long time, you can
make it OK in your head.

34:10.696 --> 34:13.581
You say, "I know what I'm doing,
it's my choice."

34:13.616 --> 34:16.585
I was living this exciting, out-there life.

34:16.621 --> 34:19.821
Go where I want,
get what I want, do what I want.

34:19.856 --> 34:22.541
Wasn't Tom's choice, but.

34:22.576 --> 34:24.545
He'll be OK, Tracey.

34:24.581 --> 34:26.666
You're setting a role model for him.

34:26.701 --> 34:29.141
You know, you're teaching him
what the right thing to do is

34:29.176 --> 34:30.626
and how much courage that takes.

34:30.661 --> 34:34.101
Pity I've wimped out of actually
telling him what's going on.

34:34.136 --> 34:36.061
You got a sec?

34:36.096 --> 34:37.025
Yep.

34:37.061 --> 34:40.061
I heard that bloke you got for
the double murder in Port Melbourne

34:40.096 --> 34:41.621
was Gus Brown's 2IC.

34:41.656 --> 34:42.585
Yes, he is.

34:42.621 --> 34:44.940
And it was a good thing
we got his wife into WITSEC

34:44.976 --> 34:47.158
because the first thing he did
was kick her door in.

34:47.193 --> 34:49.306
I've just seen Gus Brown
talking with Jason Moran.

34:49.341 --> 34:52.106
And Jason Moran knows where
WITSEC had the Randall sisters.

34:52.141 --> 34:55.061
I mean, I don't know how WITSEC
works. Do they use the same places?

34:55.096 --> 34:57.941
Well, there's half a dozen places
they use off and on

34:57.976 --> 35:00.021
or it could be somewhere
completely different.

35:00.056 --> 35:02.386
Right, so the odds are pretty long.

35:02.421 --> 35:05.181
You don't know where
they've got her, do you, boss?

35:05.216 --> 35:07.172
No. No idea.

35:11.861 --> 35:15.536
We can keep you safe, you know?
Even after the trial.

35:20.181 --> 35:23.173
I'm heading back to Bairnsdale
soon as this is over.

35:24.941 --> 35:27.146
My sister still lives there.

35:27.181 --> 35:31.021
It'd be much safer if you change
your name and you move further away.

35:31.056 --> 35:33.066
Tom needs family.

35:33.101 --> 35:38.175
And I want to get closer to
who I used to be, not further away.

35:52.861 --> 35:54.661
Jacqui James.

35:54.696 --> 35:55.696
Hi.

35:58.021 --> 35:59.454
Why?

36:04.141 --> 36:05.386
Right.

36:05.421 --> 36:07.661
You know what, Tom? I reckon
you're right about this place.

36:07.696 --> 36:09.141
It's pretty boring here, isn't it?

36:09.176 --> 36:10.106
Very.

36:10.141 --> 36:11.741
Might find you
someplace else to stay.

36:11.776 --> 36:13.341
What, now?
Time for a change of scenery.

36:13.376 --> 36:14.774
Yep. Let's go.
Something's wrong?

36:54.821 --> 36:56.254
That's him.

36:58.781 --> 37:00.226
Are you sure?

37:00.261 --> 37:03.701
Detective Kraus,
when I was a little boy,

37:03.736 --> 37:07.106
my mother taught me
a very important lesson.

37:07.141 --> 37:12.215
She taught me to never forget the face
of the white man who beats you.

37:14.581 --> 37:16.651
Well, er, you're absolutely sure?

37:17.701 --> 37:20.056
Yes, I'm sure.

37:21.101 --> 37:23.261
Steve already
had the bloodied coat

37:23.296 --> 37:24.906
and now he had a witness.

37:24.941 --> 37:27.614
Jason would go to jail after all.

37:32.621 --> 37:34.746
Following her husband's murder trial,

37:34.781 --> 37:37.701
Tracey and Tom
moved back to her old home town.

37:37.736 --> 37:39.586
No matter how hard I tried,

37:39.621 --> 37:43.181
I couldn't persuade her to change
identities and move interstate.

37:43.216 --> 37:45.900
So much for my
people-management skills.

37:47.221 --> 37:49.066
What's this place?

37:49.101 --> 37:50.986
It's our new home. I told you.

37:51.021 --> 37:53.821
Is this near
where Auntie Jodie lives?

37:53.856 --> 37:55.386
We'll see her heaps.

37:55.421 --> 37:58.541
And you can go to school
with your cousins.

37:58.576 --> 38:01.772
Will... will Daddy visit us?

38:02.821 --> 38:04.254
No.

38:05.581 --> 38:07.333
Dad's going to jail.

38:08.421 --> 38:13.281
Did he do something bad?
Yes.

38:13.316 --> 38:18.106
Did you tell on him?
Yes, I did.

38:18.141 --> 38:22.541
Sometimes you've gotta tell,
even on your friends,

38:22.576 --> 38:25.260
even if they don't like you anymore.

38:26.341 --> 38:29.781
But, Tom, that doesn't mean
that he doesn't love you

38:29.816 --> 38:33.137
or that he's bad all the way through.

38:34.181 --> 38:39.414
But what he did was very terrible
and he needs to be punished for it.

38:43.501 --> 38:46.626
Can I get a guinea pig?
Sure.

38:46.661 --> 38:51.221
Two?
If you get two, you might get more.

38:51.256 --> 38:52.866
I like baby guinea pigs.

38:52.901 --> 38:55.501
They're born with fur
and their eyes wide open.

38:55.536 --> 38:56.934
Let's go inside.

39:03.261 --> 39:10.901
# Well, I still cry for baby Jesus

39:10.936 --> 39:18.541
# And I still pray when I'm alone

39:18.576 --> 39:22.378
# And when I'm lost

39:22.413 --> 39:26.146
# He'll come to find me

39:26.181 --> 39:33.621
# Because he died to save my soul

39:33.656 --> 39:37.178
# When I can't walk

39:37.213 --> 39:40.377
# He's there to carry

39:40.412 --> 39:43.541
# When I speak... #

39:43.576 --> 39:45.746
Come on, then.

39:45.781 --> 39:48.866
# He hears my words

39:48.901 --> 39:56.306
# When I wake and I have nothing

39:56.341 --> 40:04.061
# He sends me gold,
frankincense and myrrh

40:04.096 --> 40:11.578
# Well, I still cry for baby Jesus

40:11.613 --> 40:19.061
# And I still pray when I'm alone

40:19.096 --> 40:22.938
# And when I'm lost

40:22.973 --> 40:26.746
# He'll come to find me

40:26.781 --> 40:33.821
# Because he died to save my soul. #

40:45.701 --> 40:48.226
They shot her in her head
while she slept,

40:48.261 --> 40:51.621
her son lying right there beside her,
a heartbeat away.

40:51.656 --> 40:54.986
Tracey Seymour's death was a warning

40:55.021 --> 40:58.421
to everyone who ever took the
witness stand against the underworld,

40:58.456 --> 41:00.826
another brick in the wall of silence

41:00.861 --> 41:03.694
that would defeat us again and again
in the years ahead.
