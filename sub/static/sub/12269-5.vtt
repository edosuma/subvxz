WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:03.134
(Emily) MY FATHER
 WAS AN INNOCENT MAN,

00:03.134 --> 00:04.775
DESTROYED BY POWERFUL PEOPLE.

00:04.775 --> 00:06.777
THE GRAYSONS ARE BEHIND THIS,
AND THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

00:06.777 --> 00:10.041
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE
 TO AVENGING HIS DEATH.

00:10.041 --> 00:11.512
EVENTUALLY, SOMEONE'S
GONNA FIND YOU OUT.

00:11.512 --> 00:15.186
AND I WON'T STOP UNTIL
 THEY'VE ALL PAID THE PRICE.

00:15.186 --> 00:16.347
YOU QUESTIONED
THE TYPE OF MAN I AM

00:16.347 --> 00:18.289
IN PRINT
AND TO MY FACE.

00:18.289 --> 00:20.221
I'M GONNA STAY
AT THE SOUTH FORK AGAIN.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.652
YOU TRIED TO HUMILIATE ME.

00:21.652 --> 00:25.556
GO OUT THERE AND TELL EVERYONE
THAT THIS IS MY GALLERY NOW.

00:25.556 --> 00:27.498
BECAUSE YOU INTRIGUE ME.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.131
I'VE BEEN MISDIAGNOSED.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.503
I DO NOT SUFFER
FROM HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE.

00:32.503 --> 00:33.764
WHAT?

00:33.764 --> 00:35.406
MARGAUX. ARE YOU TWO...

00:35.406 --> 00:36.707
CHARLOTTE SET US UP.

00:36.707 --> 00:38.539
DOES JACK KNOW
WHO YOU REALLY ARE?

00:38.539 --> 00:40.141
I'M SORRY.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.613
SOMEBODY TRIED TO KILL YOU
BY TAMPERING WITH YOUR BRAKES.

00:42.613 --> 00:45.246
JACK PORTER WANTS YOU DEAD.

00:45.246 --> 00:49.420
(thunderclap, rainfall)

00:49.420 --> 00:52.083
(Emily)
 WHEN ON A MISSION OF REVENGE,

00:52.083 --> 00:54.385
ONE MUST MAINTAIN TOTAL
 CONTROL...

00:54.385 --> 00:57.288
(thunder rumbles)

00:57.288 --> 01:01.292
OVER RISKS, EMOTIONS,

01:01.292 --> 01:03.364
AND ONE'S ENEMIES.

01:03.364 --> 01:06.367
(beeps)

01:08.539 --> 01:10.571
(door creaks)

01:10.571 --> 01:13.804
(thunderclap)

01:13.804 --> 01:16.147
(flashlight clicks)

01:18.679 --> 01:21.212
THE SINGLE GREATEST THREAT
 TO SUCCESS...

01:23.184 --> 01:25.085
IS LOSING CONTROL
 OF YOUR ALLIES.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.086
(Aiden whispers) WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

01:26.086 --> 01:27.688
(exhales sharply)

01:27.688 --> 01:29.190
(lowered voice) SOMEONE'S
TRYING TO KILL CONRAD,

01:29.190 --> 01:30.561
AND I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHO IT IS.

01:30.561 --> 01:31.862
BRAKE FLUID STAINS METAL.
IF I COULD JUST FIND--

01:31.862 --> 01:34.094
IT'S NOT HERE, EMILY.
DON'T YOU THINK I'VE LOOKED?

01:34.094 --> 01:35.696
I CAN'T LET THIS GO, AIDEN.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.768
WHOEVER'S BEHIND THIS
COULD JEOPARDIZE EVERYTHING.

01:37.768 --> 01:38.869
OR YOUR WEDDING, YOU MEAN.

01:38.869 --> 01:40.401
THERE WON'T BE ONE
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.633
DANIEL AND I HAD A FIGHT.
SO WHAT? I'LL DEAL WITH IT.

01:42.633 --> 01:44.275
I THINK YOU MAY BE
OVERESTIMATING

01:44.275 --> 01:45.536
YOUR INFLUENCE ON HIM.
 DON'T TELL ME HOW
TO DO MY JOB.

01:45.536 --> 01:47.308
THEN STOP DOING MINE.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.480
LET ME FIND OUT
WHO TRIED TO KILL CONRAD.

01:49.480 --> 01:52.413
(thunderclap)

01:52.413 --> 01:53.414
FINE.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.286
BUT PLEASE TELL ME THAT

01:55.286 --> 01:57.248
CONRAD HAS NO IDEA
SOMEONE CUT THE BRAKES.

01:57.248 --> 01:59.150
I CAN'T HAVE HIM DRAWING
HIS OWN CONCLUSIONS.

01:59.150 --> 02:01.522
NO, HE HAS NO IDEA.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.894
GOOD.

02:03.894 --> 02:07.528
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT.
(sighs)

02:09.729 --> 02:11.131
(Dawes' "Stories Don't End"
playing)

02:11.131 --> 02:12.132
(door opens)

02:12.132 --> 02:14.735
HERE YOU GO, BIG GUY.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.208
YOU'RE ALL CLEAN...

02:17.208 --> 02:19.610
WELL, FOR THE NEXT
THREE MINUTES ANYWAYS.

02:19.610 --> 02:21.442
JACK, ARE YOU HERE?

02:21.442 --> 02:22.843
HEY.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.345
OH, I REMEMBER THOSE.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.616
WH--
 (chuckles)

02:25.616 --> 02:26.917
CHARLOTTE SAID IT WAS OKAY
TO COME UP.

02:26.917 --> 02:29.780
(chuckles) OF COURSE.
COME ON IN.

02:29.780 --> 02:31.322
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

02:31.322 --> 02:33.924
AND THIS MUST BE
 LE PETIT CARL, HUH?
 OH, YEAH.

02:33.924 --> 02:35.626
HE'S APPARENTLY ALREADY
THE LADIES' MAN.
 CAN I?

02:35.626 --> 02:37.288
YEAH, PLEASE.
 HELLO.

02:37.288 --> 02:39.159
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
 (gasps) VERY BUSY.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.262
YEAH?
 MY FIRST ISSUE OF "VOULEZ"
 COMES OUT TOMORROW.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.564
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
YOUR CREW'S BEEN IN HERE.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.236
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
WORKING THEM TO THE BONE.

02:45.236 --> 02:47.498
YEAH, TO GREAT RESULT.

02:47.498 --> 02:50.401
(fusses)
 WE'RE HAVING A BIG
CELEBRATION AT THE OFFICE.

02:50.401 --> 02:53.704
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU
TO BE MY GUEST.

02:53.704 --> 02:55.706
OH, I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW.

02:55.706 --> 02:57.508
NO, YOU MUST COME.

02:57.508 --> 02:59.550
EVEN MY FATHER IS GRACING US
WITH HIS PRESENCE.

02:59.550 --> 03:02.283
THAT'S A BIG DEAL, RIGHT?

03:02.283 --> 03:03.914
AND HE'D BE THE FIRST ONE
TO TELL YOU.

03:03.914 --> 03:06.217
WHICH IS WHY I WANT
SOMEONE NEXT TO ME

03:06.217 --> 03:08.419
WHO DOESN'T CARE.
(chuckles)
 (chuckles)

03:08.419 --> 03:11.222
(sighs)

03:11.222 --> 03:14.325
LOOK, IT SOUNDS LIKE FUN,
BUT I...

03:14.325 --> 03:16.597
I DON'T REALLY GET ALONG
WITH YOUR BUSINESS PARTNER

03:16.597 --> 03:18.269
OR HIS FAMILY.

03:18.269 --> 03:21.602
WELL, YOU CAN STAY HOME
AND HIDE FROM THE GRAYSONS,

03:21.602 --> 03:24.905
OR YOU CAN COME OUT AND HAVE
A MARVELOUS TIME WITH ME.

03:24.905 --> 03:28.239
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.
 (chuckles)

03:28.239 --> 03:30.981
I'LL GET A SITTER.
 THEN IT'S A DATE.

03:32.643 --> 03:35.246
BYE-BYE, CARL.
 à BIENTôT.

03:37.248 --> 03:38.489
WELL, I HAVE MANY
ENEMIES.

03:38.489 --> 03:40.291
A MAN DOES NOT REACH
MY POSITION

03:40.291 --> 03:41.952
WITHOUT AMASSING
HIS FAIR SHARE.

03:41.952 --> 03:46.757
BUT CURRENTLY JACK PORTER IS
MY PRIMARY CONCERN AMONGST THEM.

03:46.757 --> 03:48.799
I BELIEVE THAT
HE IS RESPONSIBLE

03:48.799 --> 03:50.931
FOR THE SABOTAGE
THAT NEARLY ENDED MY LIFE.

03:50.931 --> 03:51.962
WHAT'S HE AFTER?

03:51.962 --> 03:54.735
REVENGE--
MISGUIDED AS IT MAY BE.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.837
I'LL DO WHAT I CAN.

03:56.837 --> 04:00.411
BUT WHEN YOU DEMOED THE CAR,
YOU DESTROYED MY BEST LEAD.

04:00.411 --> 04:02.713
OH.
 THIS WON'T BE EASY.

04:02.713 --> 04:04.975
WELL, NOTHING OF VALUE
EVER IS.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.656
DO YOU MIND EXPLAINING WHY
YOU'VE HIRED AN INVESTIGATOR

04:15.656 --> 04:16.786
WHEN I WAS THE ONE
WHO DISCOVERED THE TRUTH

04:16.786 --> 04:18.257
ABOUT YOUR "ACCIDENT"?

04:18.257 --> 04:20.391
'CAUSE THAT MAN IS RECOMMENDED
BY PEOPLE I TRUST.

04:20.391 --> 04:22.031
AND THE SAME
CANNOT BE SAID OF YOU,

04:22.031 --> 04:24.895
CONSIDERING OUR UNIQUELY
COMPLICATED HISTORY.

04:24.895 --> 04:28.999
HMM.
 BESIDES YOU SEEM SATISFIED
TO SERVE AS MY WIFE'S VALET.

04:28.999 --> 04:30.541
IF I NEED SOMEONE TO HOLD
MY HANDBAG,

04:30.541 --> 04:31.972
I'LL BE SURE
TO GIVE YOU A CALL.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.304
YOU KNOW,
YOU MAY NOT TRUST ME,

04:33.304 --> 04:34.745
BUT YOU WOULD BE WISE
TO WORK WITH ME

04:34.745 --> 04:36.977
BECAUSE I CAN GIVE YOU
WHAT YOU WANT.
 OH, AND WHAT IS THAT?

04:36.977 --> 04:38.549
YOUR DAUGHTER.

04:38.549 --> 04:41.382
I DON'T NEED AN INVESTIGATOR

04:41.382 --> 04:43.914
TO SEE THAT CHARLOTTE'S VISITS
HERE HAVE BECOME NONEXISTENT,

04:43.914 --> 04:46.457
AND THAT IT COINCIDES WITH
HER MOVING IN WITH PORTER.

04:46.457 --> 04:49.490
HE'S... OBVIOUSLY POISONED HER
AGAINST YOU.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.462
WELL, YOU'RE OBSERVANT,
MR. MATHIS,

04:51.462 --> 04:53.964
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.
 AND YOU FEEL THAT
EXPOSING THE TRUTH

04:53.964 --> 04:55.826
ABOUT PORTER WILL GIVE HER
THE DOSE OF PERSPECTIVE

04:55.826 --> 04:56.997
TO WIN HER BACK.

05:02.333 --> 05:05.075
YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN
HELP ME WITH THAT?

05:05.075 --> 05:06.837
I CAN GUARANTEE IT.

05:06.837 --> 05:09.039
OOH, YOU SOUND LIKE A MAN
WHO HAS SKIN IN THE GAME.

05:09.039 --> 05:11.011
I'M JUST SOMEBODY WHO WANTS
TO PROVE HIS WORTH

05:11.011 --> 05:12.943
TO THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE.

05:12.943 --> 05:16.947
(chuckles)
OBSERVANT AND AMBITIOUS.

05:16.947 --> 05:19.790
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

05:19.790 --> 05:24.555
I'LL CALL OFF MY MAN AND PLACE
YOU IN HIS STEAD PERMANENTLY,

05:24.555 --> 05:26.697
IF YOU CAN ENSURE THAT
JACK PORTER SPENDS

05:26.697 --> 05:29.800
THE REST OF HIS LIFE
ROTTING IN A PRISON CELL.

05:29.800 --> 05:33.764
NOTHING
WOULD PLEASE ME MORE.

05:33.764 --> 05:37.408
(birds chirping)

05:37.408 --> 05:39.740
(latch rattles)

05:41.942 --> 05:43.043
JUDGING BY YOUR REACTION,
I'M GUESSING

05:43.043 --> 05:44.445
YOU WERE EXPECTING
SOMEONE ELSE.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.478
YEAH,
ACTUALLY, OUR MOTHER.

05:47.478 --> 05:50.821
OH.
 SHE JUST CAN'T STOP
INTERFERING.

05:50.821 --> 05:52.383
WITH WHAT?

05:52.383 --> 05:54.825
IN THIS CASE, US.

05:54.825 --> 05:56.587
SHE ASKED ME TO STOP BY
BEFORE WORK

05:56.587 --> 05:59.490
SAYING SHE HAD SOMETHING
FOR ME, BUT OBVIOUSLY

05:59.490 --> 06:01.031
SHE'S ATTEMPTING
TO MANUFACTURE

06:01.031 --> 06:02.693
A DéTENTE BETWEEN US.

06:02.693 --> 06:03.994
I DIDN'T REALIZE
I HAD A PROBLEM WITH YOU.

06:03.994 --> 06:05.766
OH, YOU DIDN'T,
BUT IT'S NO SECRET

06:05.766 --> 06:07.838
I HAVE ONE WITH YOU,
WHICH--TRUTH BE TOLD--

06:07.838 --> 06:10.000
WASN'T FAIR,
NOT TO MENTION MISDIRECTED.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.802
SO I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

06:11.802 --> 06:13.904
THEN I WAS SUCCESSFUL.

06:13.904 --> 06:15.706
(chuckles)
PUPPET MASTER HERSELF.

06:15.706 --> 06:17.608
YOU KNOW, IT REALLY
IS A COMPULSION WITH YOU.

06:17.608 --> 06:18.879
OH, WHO CAN BLAME A MOTHER
FOR WANTING

06:18.879 --> 06:20.080
TO PUT HER HOUSE IN ORDER?

06:20.080 --> 06:22.513
I GOT A MAGAZINE TO LAUNCH.
SO ARE WE DONE,

06:22.513 --> 06:24.455
OR IS THERE ANOTHER REASON
YOU WANTED ME TO COME BY?

06:24.455 --> 06:25.656
GOOD MORNING.

06:25.656 --> 06:28.419
WOW, RIGHT.

06:28.419 --> 06:30.891
DANIEL, YOU'VE BEEN
STAYING AT THE SOUTH FORK,

06:30.891 --> 06:31.992
SO YOU WOULDN'T KNOW.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.994
EMILY IS TAKING
CHARLOTTE AND MYSELF

06:33.994 --> 06:35.826
SHOPPING FOR
WEDDING CLOTHES TODAY.

06:35.826 --> 06:37.528
OF COURSE, PATRICK AND I
AREN'T THE ONLY

06:37.528 --> 06:38.899
PEACE TREATY YOU'VE NEGOTIATED.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.532
DANIEL, I WANT NOTHING MORE
THAN TO MOVE PAST

06:41.532 --> 06:43.834
THE UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT
AT NOLAN'S PARTY.

06:43.834 --> 06:45.035
OKAY, WELL, I GOTTA RUN.

06:45.035 --> 06:47.137
WHEN I GET BACK FROM THE CITY,
CAN WE TALK?

06:47.137 --> 06:48.439
I DON'T KNOW
WHEN I'LL BE DONE TONIGHT.

06:48.439 --> 06:49.880
BUT IF THERE'S TIME,
THEN SURE.

06:49.880 --> 06:53.043
PATRICK, MY OFFICE IS GONNA
NEED SOME NEW ART FOR THE LOBBY.

06:53.043 --> 06:55.015
I KNOW A GUY.
 YEAH?

06:55.015 --> 06:57.087
WHY DON'T YOU
WALK ME TO MY CAR?

06:57.087 --> 06:58.989
YOU LADIES HAVE FUN.

06:58.989 --> 07:02.092
EMILY, I AM SO SORRY.

07:02.092 --> 07:03.994
I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
HOW IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME

07:03.994 --> 07:06.957
THAT SEEING YOUR INTENDED
WOULD CAUSE STRESS.

07:06.957 --> 07:09.500
I HOPE THE PRICE OF THE DRESS
DOESN'T DO THE SAME FOR YOU.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.931
REMEMBER, THEY'RE MY TREAT.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.202
(chuckles) OF COURSE.

07:12.202 --> 07:15.105
BUT I DO HOPE
TODAY'S WEDDING EXCURSION

07:15.105 --> 07:17.768
DOESN'T PROVE TO BE
AN EXERCISE IN FUTILITY.

07:17.768 --> 07:21.441
IT WOULD BE SUCH A SHAME...
(clicks tongue) AGAIN. HMM.

07:39.089 --> 07:41.862
HMM. SO I THINK
THAT YOU'LL AGREE

07:41.862 --> 07:43.864
THAT THIS IS THE FAR
MORE BEAUTIFUL SELECTION,

07:43.864 --> 07:46.837
AND THIS BRACELET SHOULD GO
VERY NICELY WITH IT.

07:46.837 --> 07:49.670
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR SUGGESTION, EMILY,

07:49.670 --> 07:50.871
BUT I FEEL AS IF I'VE SEEN
THE DRESS YOU CHOSE

07:50.871 --> 07:52.142
A MILLION TIMES.

07:52.142 --> 07:53.744
WELL, YOU KNOW BEST,
VICTORIA.

07:53.744 --> 07:55.946
(inhales deeply) MM.

07:59.009 --> 08:01.481
CHARLOTTE, IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE WEARING TO THE WEDDING?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.083
EMILY SAID I COULD CHOOSE
ANYTHING.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.055
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO
THE TRADITIONAL ROUTE,

08:05.055 --> 08:07.788
SEEING AS SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
IN MY BRIDAL PARTY.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.089
OH, HOW FORWARD-THINKING.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.591
I HOPE DANIEL DOESN'T
MISINTERPRET

08:10.591 --> 08:11.722
YOUR LAISSEZ-FAIRE
ATTITUDE.

08:11.722 --> 08:14.194
OH, HE KNOWS
I'M JUST AS EXCITED AS HE IS.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.166
AND WE SHARE
THAT ENTHUSIASM.

08:16.166 --> 08:17.728
I SIMPLY CANNOT WAIT
TO SEE THE DRESS YOU CHOSE

08:17.728 --> 08:20.500
FOR THE REHEARSAL DINNER.
WOULD YOU BE A DEAR

08:20.500 --> 08:22.573
AND TAKE MS. THORNE BACK
SO THAT SHE CAN MODEL IT FOR US?

08:22.573 --> 08:23.804
WITH PLEASURE.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.636
HERE. I'LL TAKE THAT.

08:25.636 --> 08:26.877
RIGHT THIS WAY.

08:26.877 --> 08:28.508
CHARLOTTE, YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.813
CLEARLY, YOU HATE THE DRESS.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.615
OH, I'M NOT TERRIBLY
WORRIED ABOUT IT,

08:34.615 --> 08:36.717
AS IT WILL BE THE LAST TIME
I EVER SEE IT.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.219
YOUR BROTHER NEEDS
OUR PROTECTION.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.121
HE MAY BE SMART
AND AMBITIOUS,

08:41.121 --> 08:42.823
BUT HE'S FAR TOO TRUSTING
OF WOMEN.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.855
YOU SAY THAT ABOUT EVERYONE
HE GETS SERIOUS WITH.

08:44.855 --> 08:46.256
REMEMBER SARA?

08:46.256 --> 08:48.098
WELL, YOUR BROTHER ENSURED
THAT I WOULD NEVER FORGET HER,

08:48.098 --> 08:49.630
BUT AT LEAST THAT
COCKTAIL WAITRESS

08:49.630 --> 08:51.261
IS PREFERABLE TO EMILY.

08:51.261 --> 08:54.034
AND WHAT HAS EMILY DONE
THAT'S SO WRONG?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.535
YOU DON'T KNOW?

08:55.535 --> 08:59.539
SHE BROKE THEIR FIRST ENGAGEMENT
AND DANIEL'S HEART

08:59.539 --> 09:01.071
OVER A TRYST
WITH YOUR CURRENT LANDLORD.

09:01.071 --> 09:02.813
(whispers) JACK?
 MM-HMM.

09:02.813 --> 09:04.074
(normal voice) OH, MY GOD.
 MM-HMM.

09:04.074 --> 09:06.877
YOU'RE DIGGING TO SEE
IF SHE TRULY LOVES DANIEL.

09:06.877 --> 09:08.779
WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY NOT
FOR HER FASHION SENSE.

09:08.779 --> 09:10.050
YOU KNOW, I DID THINK
IT WAS WEIRD

09:10.050 --> 09:11.852
SHE WAS AT
THE STOWAWAY LAST NIGHT

09:11.852 --> 09:13.754
INSTEAD OF TRYING
TO FIX THINGS WITH HIM.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.726
WHAT WAS JACK'S ATTITUDE
TOWARD HER?

09:15.726 --> 09:17.958
I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'S INTO MARGAUX RIGHT NOW.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.674
HEY.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.345
I WAS WONDERING IF I WAS
EVER GONNA SEE YOU AGAIN.

09:35.345 --> 09:38.809
UH, WELL...
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO CALL.

09:38.809 --> 09:39.850
BUT YOU FORGOT WHAT THOSE
LITTLE NUMBERS

09:39.850 --> 09:41.311
ON YOUR PHONE WERE FOR,
RIGHT?

09:41.311 --> 09:43.854
PHONES STILL HAVE NUMBERS?
(chuckles)

09:43.854 --> 09:47.758
SO IS, UH...

09:47.758 --> 09:49.760
MAMA BEAR IN THE CAVE?

09:49.760 --> 09:51.291
WHY? ARE YOU LOOKING TO PICK
ANOTHER FIGHT WITH HER?

09:51.291 --> 09:53.093
NOT AT ALL.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.265
NO, I JUST, UH...

09:55.265 --> 09:58.699
WONDERED IF WE HAD SOME
PRIVACY...
 (types)

09:58.699 --> 10:00.270
TO TALK...

10:00.270 --> 10:02.803
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
THE OTHER NIGHT.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.274
WELL, I DON'T HAVE
ANY SECRETS FROM MY MOTHER.

10:04.274 --> 10:06.376
SHE KNOWS THAT I'M GAY.
 OH.

10:06.376 --> 10:07.778
THE QUESTION IS
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

10:07.778 --> 10:11.742
OH, WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
I HAVE, UH...

10:11.742 --> 10:13.984
WELL-CALIBRATED GAYDAR.
 (chuckles)

10:13.984 --> 10:16.286
AND, UH...

10:16.286 --> 10:18.719
LEAVE IT AT THAT.
 (whispers) YOU'RE A LIAR.

10:20.721 --> 10:21.852
WH--EXCUSE ME?

10:21.852 --> 10:23.023
DID YOU REALLY THINK
I WOULDN'T FIND OUT

10:23.023 --> 10:24.624
YOU WENT TO MY EX-WIFE?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.096
YOU PAID HER 20 GRAND
TO GET DIRT ON ME?

10:26.096 --> 10:27.357
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

10:27.357 --> 10:28.899
WHO DOES THAT?

10:28.899 --> 10:30.300
UH... YEAH, OKAY.

10:30.300 --> 10:33.133
I KNOW THIS LOOKS, UH,
BAD ON THE SURFACE, BUT--

10:33.133 --> 10:35.666
I DON'T WANT SOMEONE
DIGGING THROUGH MY LIFE.

10:35.666 --> 10:38.138
PATRICK, I, UH...
 YOU GOT A QUESTION FOR ME,
YOU CAN ASK ME.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.870
DON'T GO BEHIND MY BACK.

10:39.870 --> 10:41.111
I DON'T PLAY GAMES,

10:41.111 --> 10:42.673
BUT CLEARLY, YOU DO.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.777
(indistinct conversations)

10:46.777 --> 10:49.079
UH, THE SECOND "VOULEZ"
 BACKDROP SHOULD GO HERE.
 (man) OKAY.

10:49.079 --> 10:51.922
AND I WANT LIGHTS HERE,
HERE, AND OVER THE BAR.
 YOU GOT IT.

10:51.922 --> 10:53.423
NOTHING FLUORESCENT.
 OF COURSE.

10:53.423 --> 10:55.655
LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW
HOW THINGS ARE DONE IN FRANCE,

10:55.655 --> 10:57.928
BUT YOU DO HAVE AN ASSISTANT
TO HANDLE THIS STUFF.

10:57.928 --> 11:00.260
UH, CLEAR THIS WALL, PLEASE.
 (woman) I'LL GET ON THAT

11:00.260 --> 11:02.362
ONLY I KNOW WHAT
MY FATHER LIKES...

11:02.362 --> 11:04.735
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
WHAT HE DOES NOT.

11:04.735 --> 11:06.737
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T CARE
WHAT YOUR FATHER THOUGHT.

11:06.737 --> 11:08.268
(chuckles)
IT IS BETTER FOR BOTH OF US

11:08.268 --> 11:09.900
IF HE'S HAPPY
TOMORROW NIGHT.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.842
HE WILL BE
WHEN HE SEES THIS.

11:11.842 --> 11:14.905
HOT OFF THE PRESS.
 (chuckles)

11:14.905 --> 11:17.147
♪♪♪

11:17.147 --> 11:18.979
WELL, I SEE THIS
AND ONLY THINK

11:18.979 --> 11:22.452
OF HOW MUCH MORE WORK
WE HAVE TO DO--

11:22.452 --> 11:24.384
LIKE OUR WEDDING ISSUE--

11:24.384 --> 11:26.216
ESPECIALLY SINCE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO WRITE.

11:26.216 --> 11:29.119
I MEAN, I HAVE PLENTY
ON YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

11:29.119 --> 11:31.862
BUT EMILY? NOT SO MUCH.

11:31.862 --> 11:33.794
WELL, SHE'S HAD
A TOUGH LIFE.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.996
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT
BY LOOKING AT HER.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.428
HER PARENTS DIED
WHEN SHE WAS VERY YOUNG

11:38.428 --> 11:40.170
IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

11:40.170 --> 11:41.802
SHE WAS THE ONLY SURVIVOR.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.234
I KNOW, BUT WE NEED MORE
FOR HER PROFILE.

11:44.234 --> 11:46.436
EVEN JUST A PICTURE
OF HER FAMILY, PERHAPS,

11:46.436 --> 11:47.878
WOULD GIVE ME SOMETHING
TO GO ON.

11:47.878 --> 11:49.980
I... I MEAN,
I-I DON'T HAVE ONE.

11:49.980 --> 11:51.812
SHE DOESN'T KEEP
ANY AROUND THE HOUSE.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.243
WHAT, YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
HER PARENTS?

11:53.243 --> 11:55.415
NO.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.187
WELL, IT WOULD SEEM THEN
WE BOTH HAVE

11:57.187 --> 12:00.050
MUCH TO LEARN ABOUT
YOUR ELUSIVE FIANCéE.

12:05.455 --> 12:08.799
THANK YOU.

12:08.799 --> 12:09.800
DID, UH, CHARLOTTE
COME IN WITH YOU?

12:09.800 --> 12:11.461
NO, CONRAD, SHE DIDN'T.

12:14.304 --> 12:15.866
YOU KNOW, NOT SO LONG AGO

12:15.866 --> 12:17.437
SHE WAS WORSHIPPING
AT YOUR FEET.

12:17.437 --> 12:18.738
NOW SHE WOULDN'T EVEN
COME VISIT YOU

12:18.738 --> 12:19.739
WHEN YOU WERE AT
THE HOSPITAL.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.171
AND I HAVE TO WONDER
WHAT YOU DID

12:21.171 --> 12:23.914
TO CREATE
SUCH A PROFOUND RIFT.
 (clinking)

12:23.914 --> 12:25.045
WELL, CHARLOTTE BELIEVES

12:25.045 --> 12:26.817
SHE'S BEEN MADE FULLY AWARE
OF THE TRUTH

12:26.817 --> 12:29.119
ABOUT THE BOMBING
OF GRAYSON GLOBAL,

12:29.119 --> 12:30.981
AND MY ROLE IN WHAT
TRANSPIRED.

12:30.981 --> 12:33.753
NOW SHE'S CONVINCED
THAT I'M SOLELY RESPONSIBLE

12:33.753 --> 12:34.985
FOR DECLAN PORTER'S DEATH.

12:34.985 --> 12:38.859
(clinks)
 HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

12:38.859 --> 12:40.891
I'M SURE IT WAS JACK.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.795
HE TURNED HER AGAINST ME.

12:44.795 --> 12:47.898
NOW SHE BLAMES ME FOR
THE LOSS OF HER UNBORN CHILD.

12:49.199 --> 12:51.771
YOU KNOW, WHEN I BELIEVED
I WAS DYING,

12:51.771 --> 12:53.974
I WAS FIGHTING THE CLOCK
TO WIN HER BACK.

12:53.974 --> 12:57.908
NOW I'M PRAYING THAT TIME
WILL HEAL THOSE WOUNDS.

12:57.908 --> 12:59.910
WELL, WHEN A WOMAN
LOSES THE MAN SHE LOVES,

12:59.910 --> 13:02.152
WHO HAPPENS TO BE
THE FATHER OF HER CHILD,

13:02.152 --> 13:05.916
SHE FEELS A PAIN
THAT IS UNIMAGINABLE--

13:05.916 --> 13:07.357
ONE SHE CAN NEITHER FORGET,
NOR FORGIVE.

13:07.357 --> 13:11.261
SEE IT AS YOU MUST,
BUT I WILL NOT LOSE MY DAUGHTER

13:11.261 --> 13:14.264
TO JACK PORTER.
AND IN A HAPPY TURN OF EVENTS,

13:14.264 --> 13:17.868
I HAVE YOUR BRITISH LACKEY'S
GUARANTEE ON THAT.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.075
SALLIE, HEY, THANKS
FOR WATCHING CARL.

13:25.075 --> 13:27.237
I'LL, UH, I'LL PICK HIM UP
IN A HALF AN HOUR. OKAY?

13:27.237 --> 13:30.580
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

13:30.580 --> 13:31.942
(beep)

13:31.942 --> 13:33.513
(switch clicks)

13:33.513 --> 13:34.814
LOOKING FOR THIS?

13:34.814 --> 13:37.817
(panting)

13:38.818 --> 13:39.990
WHO ARE YOU?

13:39.990 --> 13:42.192
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY HOUSE?

13:42.192 --> 13:43.994
CONRAD GRAYSON SENT ME.

13:43.994 --> 13:46.526
DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT HERE TO HURT YOU.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.959
(thud)

13:48.959 --> 13:50.030
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

13:50.030 --> 13:51.932
IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT
THAT MATTERS, IS IT?

13:51.932 --> 13:55.035
IT'S WHAT GRAYSON WANTS,
AND THAT IS YOU GONE.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.107
I DON'T CARE
WHAT HE WANTS.

13:57.107 --> 13:58.838
WELL, YOU NEED TO START...

13:58.838 --> 13:59.910
NOW.

14:01.111 --> 14:03.573
YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD
A LOT ABOUT YOU--

14:03.573 --> 14:06.446
MOSTLY THAT YOU'RE
A GOOD MAN.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.848
BUT THE PROBLEM IS
YOU'VE MADE AN ENEMY

14:08.848 --> 14:09.920
WITH A VERY BAD ONE.

14:11.081 --> 14:12.522
HEY.
 YOU THINK I DON'T
KNOW THAT...

14:12.522 --> 14:15.155
CALM DOWN.
 AFTER EVERYTHING
 HE'S TAKEN FROM ME?

14:15.155 --> 14:16.256
I ASSURE YOU,
I HAD NOTHING TO DO

14:16.256 --> 14:17.587
WITH WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR FAMILY.

14:17.587 --> 14:19.559
YOU WANT A MEDAL?
YOU WORK FOR HIM!

14:19.559 --> 14:21.261
THE REASON I TOOK
THIS ASSIGNMENT

14:21.261 --> 14:22.562
WAS TO GIVE YOU TIME.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.065
FOR WHAT?
 TO RUN.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.998
CONRAD GRAYSON
IS NOT GOING TO REST

14:27.998 --> 14:29.239
UNTIL YOU ARE
TAKEN CARE OF.

14:29.239 --> 14:30.570
SO I'M GIVING YOU
A CHANCE.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.943
AND IF YOU WANT ANY KIND
OF FUTURE WITH YOUR SON,

14:32.943 --> 14:35.605
YOU LEAVE TOWN NOW.
 YOU DON'T COME BACK,

14:35.605 --> 14:38.208
AND YOU DON'T CONTACT
ANYBODY HERE EVER AGAIN.

14:51.661 --> 14:55.065
OH, SUBMERSIBLE CRATE AND...

14:55.065 --> 14:58.298
HOMING BEACON. I THINK IT WAS
"TOWN & COUNTRY" SAID,

14:58.298 --> 15:01.171
"THEY WERE THE MUST-HAVES
FOR THE HAMPTONS THIS SEASON.
 (beeps)

15:01.171 --> 15:03.173
I NEED YOU TO HOLD ON TO THESE
UNTIL THE WEDDING.

15:03.173 --> 15:05.205
AFTER DANIEL'S
LAUNCH PARTY TONIGHT,

15:05.205 --> 15:07.137
I PLAN ON HAVING HIM
BACK FOR GOOD.
 (chuckles)

15:07.137 --> 15:10.410
OPERATION "RECOMMIT."

15:10.410 --> 15:13.143
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS THE DRESS
SHOPPING WITH VICTORIA.

15:13.143 --> 15:17.417
YEAH, YOUR LITTLE EXCURSION
MADE THE FRONT PAGE OF "T.M.I."

15:17.417 --> 15:20.590
THOUGH, HONESTLY, I'M STUNNED
THAT VICKY AGREED TO GO,

15:20.590 --> 15:22.422
ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU TOLD
THE WORLD SHE WAS MORE,

15:22.422 --> 15:24.995
MM... BARGAIN BASEMENT
THAN HAUTE COUTURE.

15:24.995 --> 15:26.696
WELL, SHE'S OBVIOUSLY
UP TO SOMETHING.

15:26.696 --> 15:29.259
HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT
WHO'S TRYING TO OFF HER HUBBY?

15:29.259 --> 15:32.702
NOT YET, BUT AIDEN'S
TAKEN OVER THE INVESTIGATION.

15:32.702 --> 15:35.205
OH... GOOD.

15:35.205 --> 15:37.167
'CAUSE EVERYTHING WENT
JUST PITHY LAST YEAR

15:37.167 --> 15:38.368
WHEN HE WAS ON THE CASE.

15:38.368 --> 15:42.342
MY PRIORITY IS TO KEEP
THE WEDDING ON TRACK.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.174
I KNOW THINGS WENT SOUTH
BEFORE--

15:44.174 --> 15:47.217
YEAH, THEY DIDN'T
JUST GO SOUTH, EMS.

15:47.217 --> 15:49.419
THEY WENT ARCTIC.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:49.419 --> 15:52.352
FRANKLY, I'M KINDA TIRED
OF THE WAY THAT THIS STUFF

15:52.352 --> 15:54.284
IS CONSTANTLY
SCREWING UP OUR LIVES,

15:54.284 --> 15:57.527
ESPECIALLY...
STUFF YOU WANT THE MOST.

15:57.527 --> 15:59.259
WAIT. WHERE IS THIS
COMING FROM?

15:59.259 --> 16:00.530
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

16:00.530 --> 16:02.332
NO.

16:02.332 --> 16:04.194
I JUST--

16:04.194 --> 16:06.196
I JUST WANT THIS
TO GO SMOOTHLY,

16:06.196 --> 16:09.069
AND... FOR THIS TO END.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.541
IT WILL.
I HAVE IT ALL HANDLED.

16:11.541 --> 16:14.344
SEE...

16:14.344 --> 16:17.177
YOU SAY THAT, EMS,
BUT, UH,

16:17.177 --> 16:18.708
THE MORE STRINGS YOU PULL,

16:18.708 --> 16:20.280
THE EASIER IT IS
TO GET STRANGLED.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.313
THEN AGAIN, I'M JUST
A SELF-MADE BILLIONAIRE

16:23.313 --> 16:26.716
WITH A 170 I.Q., SO...
WHAT DO I KNOW, RIGHT?

16:40.470 --> 16:42.172
I UNDERSTAND
THAT CONRAD'S USING YOU

16:42.172 --> 16:44.204
TO DEAL WITH JACK PORTER,

16:44.204 --> 16:46.176
WHICH POSES A PROBLEM...

16:46.176 --> 16:49.079
(water lapping)
 BECAUSE JACK IS VITAL
TO ACHIEVING MY GOAL.

16:49.079 --> 16:52.242
WHY, YOU NEED SOMEONE
TO MIX YOU A DRINK?

16:52.242 --> 16:55.145
I WILL NOT GIVE UP
A SCINTILLA

16:55.145 --> 16:57.047
OF EMOTIONAL LEVERAGE
I HAVE OVER EMILY.

16:57.047 --> 16:58.318
NOW MUCH LIKE YOU,

16:58.318 --> 17:01.121
JACK SEEMS TO HAVE
THE ABILITY TO UNNERVE HER.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.792
I'VE LEARNED THAT
HER CONNECTION TO HIM

17:02.792 --> 17:04.594
IS STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE.

17:04.594 --> 17:07.057
SO WHILE YOU MAY
REPRESENT HER PAST,

17:07.057 --> 17:09.729
JACK PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE
IN HER PRESENT.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.560
WELL, YOUR HUSBAND
HAS OTHER PLANS FOR HIM.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.164
OH, WELL, THAT'S NOT
MY CONCERN...

17:14.164 --> 17:15.405
NOR SHOULD IT BE YOURS.

17:15.405 --> 17:17.307
YOU MOVED HERE
BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU WANTED

17:17.307 --> 17:19.239
TO HELP ME STOP
THIS MARRIAGE.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.241
I SUGGEST THAT YOU DETERMINE
WHICH MASTER

17:21.241 --> 17:23.242
IS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST
TO SERVE.

17:23.242 --> 17:26.445
SO WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE ME DO?

17:31.621 --> 17:34.053
(keys jingle)

17:34.053 --> 17:36.526
EMILY.
 VICTORIA, WHAT A SURPRISE.

17:36.526 --> 17:38.628
WELL, I NEEDED
TO SPEAK TO YOU.
 WELL, CAN IT WAIT?

17:38.628 --> 17:40.690
WE WOULDN'T WANT TO BE LATE
FOR DANIEL'S PARTY.

17:40.690 --> 17:43.193
I'M AFRAID IT CAN'T.

17:43.193 --> 17:45.265
THIS INVOLVES
THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT

17:45.265 --> 17:47.367
THAT TOOK
FATHER PAUL'S LIFE.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.569
THE TRAGEDY HAS BECOME
EVEN MORE UNSETTLING

17:49.569 --> 17:51.271
IN THE LIGHT
OF NEW EVIDENCE.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.643
EVIDENCE OF WHAT?

17:53.643 --> 17:55.245
SABOTAGE.

17:57.347 --> 18:00.350
CONRAD IS CONVINCED THAT
JACK PORTER IS RESPONSIBLE,

18:00.350 --> 18:01.651
AND I FEAR
THAT HE MAY BE RIGHT,

18:01.651 --> 18:05.785
GIVEN HIS ACTIONS
ON THE NIGHT OF THE ELECTION.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.118
THOSE WERE EXTRAORDINARY
CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU KNOW THAT.

18:08.118 --> 18:10.560
I DON'T DISAGREE.
HE MAY WELL BE INNOCENT.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.792

27:22.311 --> 27:24.373
THIS IS NOT
ABOUT THE FIGHT.

27:24.373 --> 27:26.175
I'VE BEEN BUSTING MY ASS
TRYING TO MAKE THIS MAGAZINE

27:26.175 --> 27:28.277
INTO SOMETHING
FOR OUR FUTURE.

27:28.277 --> 27:30.980
BECAUSE I KNEW THE ONLY WAY
WE'D MAKE IT THIS TIME AROUND

27:30.980 --> 27:33.182
IS IF I STOOD ON MY OWN.

27:33.182 --> 27:34.383
BUT TONIGHT,
WHEN YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP,

27:34.383 --> 27:36.686
I REALIZED I'M THE ONLY ONE
FIGHTING FOR US.

27:36.686 --> 27:38.387
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
 REALLY?

27:38.387 --> 27:40.189
BECAUSE LATELY
I'VE BEEN FEELING LIKE

27:40.189 --> 27:42.932
I'M JUST PLAYING A ROLE
IN A STORY YOU'RE WRITING.

27:42.932 --> 27:45.965
LET'S FACE IT.
WE ONLY SET A DATE

27:45.965 --> 27:48.798
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT
MY FATHER WAS SICK.

27:48.798 --> 27:50.299
NOW WE KNOW HE'S NOT.

27:50.299 --> 27:53.102
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

27:53.102 --> 27:55.304
SOMETHING I DIDN'T WANT
TO ADMIT,

27:55.304 --> 27:56.876
BUT I CAN'T IGNORE IT
ANYMORE.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.210
I CAN'T MARRY YOU, EMILY.

28:09.819 --> 28:11.791
(sighs)

28:16.695 --> 28:18.968
I CAN'T LET HIM
CALL OFF THE WEDDING, NOLAN.

28:18.968 --> 28:22.802
THE MORE THINGS
YOU TRY TO CONTROL,

28:22.802 --> 28:24.804
THE MORE CHANCE FOR ERROR.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.836
I DIDN'T COME HERE
FOR PLATITUDES.

28:26.836 --> 28:31.280
WELL... SOMETIMES
THEY'RE TRUE, EMS,

28:31.280 --> 28:33.913
WHETHER YOU WANT THEM TO BE
OR NOT.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.815
I MEAN, CAN WE BE HONEST?

28:35.815 --> 28:39.388
DANIEL'S CHANGED.
HE'S... EVOLVED.

28:41.791 --> 28:43.392
(sighs)

28:45.454 --> 28:47.857
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

28:47.857 --> 28:50.229
YEAH, WELL...

28:50.229 --> 28:53.202
(scoffs) NEITHER DO I.

28:53.202 --> 28:56.836
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GIVE HIM
THE ONE THING THAT HE NEEDS--

28:56.836 --> 28:58.337
YOU.

28:58.337 --> 29:01.140
THE REAL YOU.

29:02.842 --> 29:04.743
ALL PEOPLE WANT
IS FOR THEIR PARTNERS

29:04.743 --> 29:06.075
TO BE HONEST WITH THEM,

29:06.075 --> 29:09.478
AND THEY CATCH ON PRETTY DAMN
QUICK WHEN YOU'RE NOT.

29:09.478 --> 29:11.520
DANIEL CAN TELL
YOU'RE FAKING IT WITH HIM--

29:11.520 --> 29:13.923
BECAUSE I CAN'T STAND
TO BE AROUND HIM.
 (chair scrapes floor)

29:13.923 --> 29:14.924
(clinks)

29:14.924 --> 29:17.186
EMS...

29:17.186 --> 29:19.458
IF YOU WANT
TO PULL THIS OFF

29:19.458 --> 29:21.390
AND KEEP YOUR PROMISE
TO JACK,

29:21.390 --> 29:23.893
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET PAST THAT.

29:23.893 --> 29:26.936
BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY
TO WIN DANIEL BACK,

29:26.936 --> 29:28.968
IS SHARE A PIECE OF YOURSELF.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.143
(sighs)

29:34.143 --> 29:37.776
THAT'S JUST RIGHT,
THANK YOU.
 (types)

29:40.079 --> 29:44.153
CLOSED THE BUYER
FOR THE ALTMAN IN GERMANY.

29:44.153 --> 29:45.554
OH...

29:45.554 --> 29:48.457
FOR CONSIDERABLY MORE
THAN EXPECTED.
 YEAH.

29:48.457 --> 29:50.219
YOU'RE AS TALENTED
A BUSINESSMAN

29:50.219 --> 29:53.092
AS YOU ARE AN ARTIST.
 THEY'RE YOUR LEADS.
I'M JUST LANDING 'EM.

29:53.092 --> 29:55.224
WE MAKE A HELL OF A TEAM.

29:55.224 --> 29:56.866
ALWAYS SO SERIOUS.

29:56.866 --> 29:58.998
YOU SHOULD HAVE COME
TO DANIEL'S EVENT.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.400
WELL, THAT'S NOT REALLY
MY SCENE.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.932
I WOULD HAVE ENJOYED
INTRODUCING YOU

30:02.932 --> 30:03.973
TO A POOL OF NEW PEOPLE.

30:05.374 --> 30:06.936
OH.

30:06.936 --> 30:09.808
YOU'RE TRYING TO SET ME UP?

30:09.808 --> 30:11.110
YOU ARE.
DANIEL WAS RIGHT.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.341
YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF,
CAN YOU?
 I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU

30:12.341 --> 30:15.414
TO HIDE BEHIND THIS GALLERY
OR YOUR CANVASES--

30:15.414 --> 30:16.916
BEAUTIFUL AS THEY MAY BE.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.447
WELL, THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN HIDING

30:18.447 --> 30:19.488
AND NOT WANTING TO GO.

30:19.488 --> 30:20.850
YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS I-

30:20.850 --> 30:22.351
I THOUGHT MAYBE
I MET SOMEONE INTERESTING.

30:22.351 --> 30:23.953
BUT, UM...

30:23.953 --> 30:26.926
I THINK MAYBE I MAY HAVE BEEN
WRONG ABOUT THAT. (chuckles)

30:26.926 --> 30:30.059
IT'S... IT'S COMPLICATED.

30:30.059 --> 30:32.862
PATRICK...

30:34.433 --> 30:38.037
I SACRIFICED PERSONAL HAPPINESS
FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS.

30:39.608 --> 30:41.210
I HOPE YOU DON'T
DO THE SAME.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.274
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
SO GOOD TO ME? HMM?

30:45.274 --> 30:48.117
I HAVE MUCH TO MAKE UP FOR.

30:48.117 --> 30:49.418
YOU DON'T.

30:49.418 --> 30:52.181
LIKE I SAID, WE ARE
A TEAM NOW, ALL RIGHT?

30:52.181 --> 30:53.622
NOTHING'S GONNA
CHANGE THAT.

30:53.622 --> 30:55.955
NOW LOOK, I HAVE TO GET
BACK TO WORK.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.556
I PROMISED DANIEL
THIS PIECE FOR HIS OFFICE.

30:57.556 --> 30:58.928
SO I'LL PROBABLY BE WORKING
THOUGHT THE NIGHT.

30:58.928 --> 31:00.559
(cell phone chimes)
 I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW?

31:00.559 --> 31:01.961
MM. BYE.
 OKAY.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.132
(kisses)
 BYE.

31:03.132 --> 31:04.233
(beep)

31:26.956 --> 31:28.587
(bag thuds)

31:28.587 --> 31:30.089
(rustling)

31:38.527 --> 31:42.571
(objects rustle)

31:42.571 --> 31:44.173
(paper flaps)

31:46.936 --> 31:47.977
(door bangs)

31:47.977 --> 31:50.940
SO YOU'RE ALIVE AND WELL
AFTER ALL.

31:52.341 --> 31:55.084
WELL, I'M ALIVE, ANYWAY.
 MM-HMM.

31:55.084 --> 31:56.385
(sighs)

31:56.385 --> 31:59.248
LOOK... ABOUT LAST NIGHT--
 YEAH, LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.

31:59.248 --> 32:01.650
WHERE I COME FROM,
WE HONOR OUR WORD,

32:01.650 --> 32:03.692
AND WE DEAL WITH THINGS
IN PERSON.

32:03.692 --> 32:05.124
(door closes)
 I WILL NOT CHASE A MAN
WHO DOES NOT KNOW

32:05.124 --> 32:08.457
HOW TO TREAT A WOMAN,
AND YOU CLEARLY DO NOT.

32:08.457 --> 32:09.498
ADIEU, JACK.

32:09.498 --> 32:11.500
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE UPSET.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.632
BUT PLEASE LET ME
JUST EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED.

32:13.632 --> 32:16.205
WE HAD AN INTRUDER.

32:16.205 --> 32:18.407
OH, MY GOD.

32:18.407 --> 32:19.708
IS CARL OKAY?

32:19.708 --> 32:21.670
I HAD TO TAKE HIM AWAY,
BUT HE'S SAFE NOW.

32:21.670 --> 32:22.711
BUT...

32:22.711 --> 32:25.244
TO BE HONEST, I...
(sighs)

32:25.244 --> 32:27.076
I WAS SCARED.

32:27.076 --> 32:28.647
AND I-I COME
ATTACK YOU LIKE THIS.

32:28.647 --> 32:31.550
I'M SO SORRY, JACK.
 NO, NO.
YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN.

32:31.550 --> 32:35.954
I'M... SO SORRY THAT
I COULDN'T BE THERE FOR YOU.

32:35.954 --> 32:39.188
YOU'RE SUCH A SWEET MAN.

32:39.188 --> 32:41.030
I HAVEN'T BEEN THAT SWEET.

32:41.030 --> 32:44.463
AND TO BE HONEST...

32:44.463 --> 32:45.634
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
IN A LONG TIME

32:45.634 --> 32:47.396
TO BE ABLE
TO MAKE ME SMILE.

33:00.179 --> 33:03.552
I ASSUME THIS IS
ABOUT JACK PORTER.

33:03.552 --> 33:06.015
WERE MY SUSPICIONS CORRECT?

33:06.015 --> 33:07.286
WAS HE THE CAUSE
OF EMILY'S LATE ARRIVAL

33:07.286 --> 33:08.717
TO DANIEL'S PARTY?

33:08.717 --> 33:11.060
NO. SHE NEVER MET WITH HIM.

33:11.060 --> 33:14.593
SHE JUST SAT ON HER PORCH
FOR A WHILE.

33:18.627 --> 33:21.170
I'D HAVE THOUGHT
I SPURRED HER TO ACTION.

33:21.170 --> 33:22.731
WELL, MAYBE HER FIDELITY
TO DANIEL

33:22.731 --> 33:24.002
IS STRONGER THAN YOU THINK.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.305
SO WHY THE URGENCY
FOR THIS MEETING?

33:26.305 --> 33:28.407
WELL, AS YOU KNOW,
YOUR HUSBAND HAD ME INVESTIGATE

33:28.407 --> 33:29.638
THE CAUSE OF THE WRECK.

33:29.638 --> 33:32.411
YES, TO SEE IF JACK
WAS INDEED RESPONSIBLE.

33:32.411 --> 33:35.314
WELL, THE SABOTAGE ITSELF
WAS EASY ENOUGH TO PULL OFF.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.615
YOU JUST PUNCTURE THE LINE.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.347
IT'S SO SIMPLE,
ANYONE COULD DO IT.

33:38.347 --> 33:43.021
EXCEPT THERE WAS NO FORCED ENTRY
PAST THE GARAGE SECURITY.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.294
WHICH MEANS
THE ACCESS CODE WAS USED.

33:45.294 --> 33:46.655
ONLY A FEW PEOPLE
KNOW THAT.

33:46.655 --> 33:49.058
AND ONLY ONE OF THEM
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY THAT NIGHT.

33:49.058 --> 33:51.630
WHY COME TO ME?
WHY NOT GO RIGHT TO CONRAD?

33:51.630 --> 33:53.602
BECAUSE I HAVE CHOSEN
WHICH MASTER TO SERVE.

33:53.602 --> 33:56.335
AND I KNEW THAT SHE WOULD WANT
TO HANDLE THIS...

33:56.335 --> 33:59.238
INTERNALLY.
 WHO WAS IT?

33:59.238 --> 34:01.770
IT WAS
ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN.

34:14.483 --> 34:15.784
WHAT'S WRONG?

34:15.784 --> 34:18.257
I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING
TERRIBLE.

34:18.257 --> 34:19.558
WHAT IS IT?

34:19.558 --> 34:22.360
AIDEN FOUND OUT
WHO TRIED TO KILL YOU.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.163
(voice breaking)
CONRAD, I--

34:24.163 --> 34:25.164
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

34:26.264 --> 34:29.598
OH, MY GOD. WHO WAS IT?

34:29.598 --> 34:32.641
WHO DID THIS?

34:32.641 --> 34:35.404
(stammers and sighs)

34:35.404 --> 34:37.275
CHARLOTTE...

34:38.777 --> 34:41.110
OH, NO.

34:41.110 --> 34:42.851
(voice breaking)
OH, GOD.

34:42.851 --> 34:46.655
I'M SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

34:46.655 --> 34:49.257
NO, IT CAN'T BE.
YOU COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS.
 I DID.

34:49.257 --> 34:52.460
I WENT CRAZY WHEN I LEARNED
THE TRUTH ABOUT DECLAN,

34:52.460 --> 34:54.393
AND I HATED YOU FOR IT.

34:56.125 --> 34:57.496
AND THAT'S WHEN
I FOUND THIS.

34:57.496 --> 35:00.199
IT WAS DECLAN'S,

35:00.199 --> 35:01.630
AND IT BROUGHT BACK
ALL THE FEELINGS

35:01.630 --> 35:03.702
ABOUT HOW YOU TOOK HIM
AWAY FROM ME,

35:03.702 --> 35:06.175
AND I WANTED YOU TO SUFFER.

35:06.175 --> 35:07.836
(sniffles)

35:07.836 --> 35:10.309
AND THEN I FELT SO GUILTY,

35:10.309 --> 35:11.710
I COULDN'T EVEN
LOOK AT YOU.

35:11.710 --> 35:15.614
THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN
SO DISTANT.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.787
AND THEN MOM TOLD ME
YOU FOUND OUT AND BLAMED JACK.

35:18.787 --> 35:21.250
AND I COULDN'T STAY QUIET.

35:21.250 --> 35:23.892
HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
IT WAS ME, I SWEAR.

35:23.892 --> 35:25.154
I'LL CONFESS EVERYTHING--

35:25.154 --> 35:27.556
NO, NO, NO, NO. OH, GOD.

35:27.556 --> 35:30.159
NO.

35:30.159 --> 35:32.331
THIS ENDS HERE.

35:33.732 --> 35:36.735
YOU'RE MY GIRL,
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

35:36.735 --> 35:37.806
AND I WILL PROTECT YOU

35:37.806 --> 35:39.568
BECAUSE THAT
IS WHAT PARENTS DO.

35:39.568 --> 35:42.541
YOU CAN REALLY FORGIVE ME?

35:42.541 --> 35:44.373
OF COURSE I CAN.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.276
CHARLOTTE,
ALL I'VE EVER WANTED

35:47.276 --> 35:49.378
WAS FOR US TO BE
FAMILY AGAIN. (chuckles)

35:50.779 --> 35:53.682
I MEAN, IF THIS IS WHAT IT TOOK
FOR US TO HAVE

35:53.682 --> 35:57.226
AN HONEST EXCHANGE,
TO HEAL OUR WOUNDS,

35:57.226 --> 35:58.887
WELL, THEN, UH...

36:01.290 --> 36:04.393
CHARLOTTE, I AM GRATEFUL
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

36:04.393 --> 36:06.665
(exhales)

36:06.665 --> 36:10.239
I LOVE YOU, DADDY.
(sighs)

36:18.707 --> 36:21.450
SO IT WAS PATRICK.
 YEAH.

36:21.450 --> 36:24.683
I FOUND THE KNIFE
IN HIS ROOM.
 HMM.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.685
THE BLADE WAS CORRODED
WITH THE BRAKE FLUID.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.387
THERE'S NO QUESTION
OF HIS GUILT.

36:28.387 --> 36:31.590
YOU TOLD VICTORIA?
 MM-HMM.

36:31.590 --> 36:34.723
I ASSUME SHE'LL DEAL
WITH PATRICK FOR YOU?

36:34.723 --> 36:37.596
NO. I KNOW HER.
SHE'LL COVER IT UP.

36:37.596 --> 36:41.470
SHE'S OBSESSED WITH HIM.

36:41.470 --> 36:43.602
AND SINCE YOU GAVE HER
THE CHANCE TO PROTECT HIM,

36:43.602 --> 36:44.833
SHE'LL BE IN YOUR DEBT,

36:44.833 --> 36:46.775
WHICH NOT ONLY
CLEARS JACK'S NAME,

36:46.775 --> 36:50.409
BUT... PUTS YOU
RIGHT WHERE I NEED YOU

36:50.409 --> 36:51.840
FOR THE FINAL STEP.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.513
WELL PLAYED... AS ALWAYS.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.545
EMILY, UH...

36:56.545 --> 36:58.717
I'M SORRY FOR THE WAY
I HANDLED JACK.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.389
YOU WERE RIGHT.

37:00.389 --> 37:03.452
MY MOTIVES WERE NOT PURE.
I...

37:03.452 --> 37:04.993
I WANTED HIM GONE.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.427
NO.

37:08.427 --> 37:09.528
I'M SORRY...

37:09.528 --> 37:12.361
FOR HOW I'VE TREATED YOU.

37:12.361 --> 37:14.563
YOU CAME BACK HERE
TO HELP ME,

37:14.563 --> 37:16.735
AND I'VE MADE YOU FEEL USED.

37:18.667 --> 37:22.411
BUT THE TRUTH IS...

37:22.411 --> 37:24.373
YOU MEAN SO MUCH MORE
TO ME THAN THAT.

37:27.676 --> 37:29.348
YOU'RE EVERYTHING TO ME.

37:33.322 --> 37:35.824
(exhales deeply)

37:47.396 --> 37:49.898
(moans)

37:49.898 --> 37:52.301
I KNEW YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND
THE SEVERITY OF THE SITUATION

37:52.301 --> 37:53.442
WHEN I CALLED YOU.

37:53.442 --> 37:55.404
THANK YOU FOR COMING,
CHARLOTTE.

37:55.404 --> 37:57.346
I DIDN'T DO THIS
FOR YOU.

37:57.346 --> 37:59.277
DAD IS CLEARLY SO PARANOID,

37:59.277 --> 38:01.350
HE'S WILLING TO BLAME
A RANDOM CAR ACCIDENT

38:01.350 --> 38:02.551
ON AN INNOCENT MAN.

38:02.551 --> 38:03.882
YOUR FATHER
HAS DIFFICULTY BELIEVING

38:03.882 --> 38:05.784
THAT ANYTHING IS ACCIDENTAL
WHEN IT COMES TO HIM.

38:05.784 --> 38:09.057
WELL, IF TAKING THE BLAME
PROTECTS JACK,

38:09.057 --> 38:10.389
I'M FINE WITH THAT.

38:22.771 --> 38:25.774
(hangers clattering)

38:28.537 --> 38:30.539
JUST NEEDED TO GRAB
A FEW THINGS.

38:30.539 --> 38:31.980
I'LL CRASH
SOMEWHERE ELSE TONIGHT.

38:31.980 --> 38:33.482
I WISH YOU WOULDN'T.

38:33.482 --> 38:35.444
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, EM?

38:35.444 --> 38:37.045
NOTHING.

38:37.045 --> 38:39.988
I'M THE ONE
WHO NEEDS TO TALK.

38:48.056 --> 38:51.099
WHAT'S THIS?
 (thuds)

38:51.099 --> 38:54.332
THESE ARE YOUR PARENTS.

38:54.332 --> 38:58.006
I'VE NEVER SEEN THEM
BEFORE.

38:58.006 --> 38:59.007
(chuckles)

38:59.007 --> 39:01.069
THAT'S YOU, OH, MY GOD.

39:01.069 --> 39:03.772
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
RECOGNIZED YOU.

39:03.772 --> 39:06.445
IT DOESN'T EVEN
FEEL LIKE MY LIFE.

39:12.451 --> 39:15.554
(sighs)

39:15.554 --> 39:19.087
THE TRUTH IS, DANIEL...

39:19.087 --> 39:22.090
I GREW UP IN A HOUSE
JUST LIKE THIS.

39:22.090 --> 39:27.536
I REMEMBER ONE NIGHT
A SUMMER STORM ROLLED IN.

39:27.536 --> 39:30.368
IT WAS SO STRONG,
IT SHOOK THE WALLS.

39:30.368 --> 39:34.002
I WAS SO SCARED.

39:34.002 --> 39:35.974
MY FATHER FOUND ME.

39:35.974 --> 39:37.646
AND I REMEMBER
IN THAT MOMENT,

39:37.646 --> 39:41.780
HE... DIDN'T TREAT ME
LIKE A CHILD.

39:41.780 --> 39:45.113
HE EXPLAINED TO ME
WHAT THUNDER REALLY WAS--

39:45.113 --> 39:48.987
JUST A CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE
AND PRESSURE.

39:48.987 --> 39:52.421
HE TOOK THE FEAR AWAY...

39:52.421 --> 39:54.022
LIKE HE ALWAYS DID.

39:54.022 --> 39:55.964
HE SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT DAD.

39:59.468 --> 40:01.470
(voice breaking)
HE WAS THE BEST.

40:04.032 --> 40:05.834
(sighs) IT'S HARD FOR ME

40:05.834 --> 40:09.137
TO SHARE MEMORIES
FROM MY PAST, DANIEL.

40:09.137 --> 40:12.681
IT'S EVEN HARDER FOR ME
TO TRUST.

40:14.443 --> 40:16.585
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE...

40:16.585 --> 40:20.418
THINK THAT BECAUSE
I LOST MY FAMILY,

40:20.418 --> 40:22.951
I NEVER KNEW
WHAT REAL LOVE WAS.

40:25.423 --> 40:28.797
BUT I DID.

40:28.797 --> 40:31.159
(voice breaking) AND IT WAS
RIPPED AWAY FROM ME.

40:31.159 --> 40:34.162
AND I STILL FEEL THAT PAIN

40:34.162 --> 40:35.864
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

40:39.067 --> 40:40.639
THAT'S WHY
I PUSH PEOPLE AWAY.

40:40.639 --> 40:42.440
(sniffles)

40:42.440 --> 40:44.543
I HAD NO IDEA.

40:44.543 --> 40:48.046
I WANT NOTHING MORE

40:48.046 --> 40:50.819
THAN TO STAND BESIDE YOU
ON OUR WEDDING DAY.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.453
THEN I WANT THAT, TOO.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.886
