WEBVTT

00:05.723 --> 00:08.368
Buddy wants
some more cake, Daddy.

00:08.369 --> 00:10.436
I already gave
him a big piece.

00:10.471 --> 00:12.338
But he ate it, Booth.

00:12.373 --> 00:13.739
Buddy loves cake.

00:13.774 --> 00:15.074
Just cut him another piece.

00:15.109 --> 00:17.409
All right, all right.

00:17.445 --> 00:19.512
Cutting Buddy
a piece of cake.

00:19.547 --> 00:20.980
Here you go,
here's a...

00:21.015 --> 00:25.351
On the plate, Daddy,
or I'll get dirty!

00:25.386 --> 00:27.119
Wow, you guys are
really into this whole

00:27.155 --> 00:28.420
imaginary friend thing.

00:28.456 --> 00:30.556
Buddy is warm
and affectionate.

00:30.591 --> 00:32.691
I think he's a good influence on Christine.
Okay, Dr. Logic.

00:32.726 --> 00:35.060
You're the one who said that
this whole imaginary stuff

00:35.096 --> 00:36.729
is crazy.
It has its place.

00:36.764 --> 00:38.731
You praying to your God
is no different

00:38.766 --> 00:40.699
than Christine giving Buddy
a piece of cake.

00:40.735 --> 00:42.768
Okay, I don't have a
tea party with God.

00:42.803 --> 00:45.538
What about Communion?
Oh, really? So, now what?

00:45.573 --> 00:47.673
The whole transubstantiation
of the Host is like a tea party?

00:47.708 --> 00:48.741
Yes.
(cell phone chimes)

00:48.776 --> 00:49.776
(sighs)

00:49.777 --> 00:50.777
Ugh.

00:50.778 --> 00:52.745
(cell phone beeps)

00:52.780 --> 00:55.314
Oh...

00:55.349 --> 00:57.283
What is it?

00:57.318 --> 01:00.352
It's Sweets's
birthday today,

01:00.388 --> 01:02.688
and I had down on
my reminder calendar

01:02.723 --> 01:04.355
to, uh, go get him
some doughnuts

01:04.391 --> 01:07.092
at this, uh, bakery
in Georgetown.

01:08.996 --> 01:11.397
I still forget he's gone.

01:13.134 --> 01:15.668
Yeah.

01:19.774 --> 01:22.675
AUBREY:
<i>The guy's name is Alex Dunaway,</i>

01:22.710 --> 01:25.077
but for now I'm just
calling him "Leatherface."

01:25.112 --> 01:27.112
(laughs) How about "the
Virginia Chainsaw Massacre"?

01:27.148 --> 01:28.714
Interesting fact--
you know,

01:28.749 --> 01:30.683
before being called
<i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,</i>

01:30.718 --> 01:33.452
the original title
was <i> Headcheese?</i>

01:33.487 --> 01:35.821
What's wrong with you?

01:35.856 --> 01:37.756
Oh, wow.

01:37.792 --> 01:39.758
Looking like some
"headcheese" if you ask me.

01:39.794 --> 01:41.293
You talk to Leatherface yet?
Not yet.

01:41.329 --> 01:43.095
Guy was ranting and
raving when he came in.

01:43.130 --> 01:45.064
I'm not exactly
fluent in crazy.

01:45.099 --> 01:47.600
I got the shrink in there
calming him down for me.

01:47.635 --> 01:49.268
Right, so I'll call Bones--
she's probably gonna want

01:49.303 --> 01:51.337
to bring the whole tree back
to the lab, all right?

01:51.372 --> 01:52.372
Okay, have fun
with that.

01:52.373 --> 01:53.772
(door opens, closes)

01:53.808 --> 01:56.575
AUBREY: Alex, my name
is Agent James Aubrey.

01:56.611 --> 01:57.643
I'm with the FBI.

01:57.678 --> 01:59.144
Do you understand
where you are?

02:00.314 --> 02:02.381
No, I-I was cutting...

02:04.252 --> 02:05.517
...blood...

02:05.553 --> 02:07.553
animals...
Animal?

02:07.588 --> 02:10.122
No, what we found was
definitely human remains.

02:10.157 --> 02:12.825
Please don't make
me look at that.

02:12.860 --> 02:14.927
At least you feel some remorse
for what you did.

02:14.962 --> 02:16.161
No, you don't
understand, man.

02:16.197 --> 02:18.030
I-I didn't kill anybody.

02:18.065 --> 02:20.232
You're covered in blood, you've
been screaming like a madman,

02:20.268 --> 02:22.167
running around
with a chainsaw.

02:22.203 --> 02:24.169
No, I-I don't
remember any of that.

02:24.205 --> 02:25.738
Well, what do
you remember?

02:25.773 --> 02:28.407
I was cutting down
an old tree, okay?

02:28.442 --> 02:30.376
I'm a park ranger.

02:30.411 --> 02:32.278
And the tree was dead
on the inside.

02:32.313 --> 02:34.647
You're saying the body was
already inside the tree?

02:34.682 --> 02:40.152
I-I started cutting it down,
and all of a sudden,

02:40.187 --> 02:42.288
blood started spraying...

02:42.323 --> 02:44.523
(stammers)
I-I swear, okay?

02:44.558 --> 02:47.159
I-I didn't know
that that was in there, okay?

02:48.362 --> 02:50.696
I think I'm
gonna be sick.

02:50.731 --> 02:52.831
Do you have a wastebasket
or something?

02:52.867 --> 02:54.733
(gags)

02:54.769 --> 02:56.035
Uh, wastebasket?!

02:56.070 --> 02:58.270
Can we get a wastebasket?!
(retching)

02:58.306 --> 03:00.539
Forget it.

03:04.412 --> 03:06.545
Ready, guys?

03:11.085 --> 03:13.552
SAROYAN:
This liquid appears to be

03:13.587 --> 03:15.554
a mixture of blood,

03:15.589 --> 03:19.391
bone, viscera, decomp fluids
and rainwater.

03:19.427 --> 03:20.926
Doing all right
there, Dr. B?

03:20.961 --> 03:22.094
You look like something's
bothering you.

03:22.129 --> 03:23.262
SAROYAN:
Which is reasonable

03:23.297 --> 03:24.563
considering
she's about to

03:24.598 --> 03:25.831
stick her hands
into body stew.

03:25.866 --> 03:27.766
Well, I feel as if an imbalance

03:27.802 --> 03:29.134
of serotonin levels

03:29.170 --> 03:31.570
have affected my
neurotransmitters.

03:31.605 --> 03:35.474
Probably caused by the fact
that today is Sweets' birthday.

03:35.509 --> 03:39.978
Whatever tool was used
to fell the tree caused

03:40.014 --> 03:41.747
significant damage to the skull.

03:41.782 --> 03:44.583
Oh, man, Sweets.

03:44.618 --> 03:46.352
He would have been what?

03:46.387 --> 03:48.754
Thirty.

03:48.789 --> 03:51.457
He didn't make it to 30?

03:56.597 --> 03:58.564
Yeah, but he
made it to happy,

03:58.599 --> 04:01.133
and that's pretty
impressive, isn't it?

04:05.106 --> 04:07.072
Well...
(clears throat)

04:07.108 --> 04:09.475
wherever Sweets is, he wouldn't
want thinking about him

04:09.510 --> 04:11.643
to affect our work.

04:13.547 --> 04:15.814
So I'm seeing the larvae
from the red carnivore beetle.

04:15.850 --> 04:17.769
SAROYAN: Can you use those
to get time of death?

04:17.793 --> 04:18.618
HODGINS: I can try.

04:18.619 --> 04:20.586
Hey, I'm also seeing
clothing fibers

04:20.620 --> 04:22.019
around the edge
of the stump.

04:22.055 --> 04:23.989
Maybe somebody fell in
and then had trouble

04:24.024 --> 04:25.891
getting themselves back out.

04:25.926 --> 04:27.693
Based on the size
of the pelvis

04:27.728 --> 04:30.429
and the uniformly
coarse granularity

04:30.464 --> 04:31.997
of this auricular
surface,

04:32.032 --> 04:34.466
the victim was a female
in her early 30s.

04:34.502 --> 04:36.835
Adults don't go climbing
inside trees alone.

04:36.871 --> 04:38.604
I do.

04:38.639 --> 04:41.340
That's where the really
beautiful Hymenoptera are.

04:41.375 --> 04:43.308
Right.

04:43.344 --> 04:44.877
But unless by some chance

04:44.912 --> 04:47.346
the victim was not
an obsessive entomologist,

04:47.381 --> 04:48.914
this is probably a body dump.

04:48.949 --> 04:52.151
But why dump her
inside of a tree?

Body stew like this, I feel like
one of the witches from <i> Macbeth.</i>

05:38.227 --> 05:40.261
BRENNAN: Based on the scoring
and abrasions

05:40.296 --> 05:41.762
to the cortical surface,

05:41.798 --> 05:42.830
multiple scavengers
fed on it.

05:42.865 --> 05:44.198
HODGINS: Hey,
lookee here.

05:44.233 --> 05:45.966
I got a piece of
the victim's shirt.

05:46.002 --> 05:47.768
Based on the level
of fungal growth,

05:47.804 --> 05:49.537
the victim's been in the tree
for about a month.

05:49.572 --> 05:51.472
Based on the blunted nature

05:51.507 --> 05:53.874
of the most anterior aspect
of the mandible,

05:53.910 --> 05:56.377
I'd say the victim
was African-American.

05:56.412 --> 05:58.379
Excellent bone structure.

05:58.414 --> 06:00.848
So a beautiful black woman
in her early 30s.

06:00.883 --> 06:03.417
Anyone seen Beyoncé recently?
(Fuentes chuckles)

06:03.452 --> 06:06.620
Unfortunately, a visual I.D.
will be very difficult to obtain

06:06.656 --> 06:08.923
since the middle of the skull
was obliterated

06:08.958 --> 06:10.691
in the process
of cutting down the tree.

06:10.726 --> 06:13.093
There are still shards of
that section of the skull lodged

06:13.129 --> 06:14.695
in the teeth
of the chainsaw.

06:14.730 --> 06:17.131
Uh, but there are,
like, a hundred pieces.

06:17.166 --> 06:19.166
Some are microscopic.

06:19.202 --> 06:21.168
Dr. Fuentes, my three-year-old
can complete

06:21.204 --> 06:23.237
a hundred-piece puzzle
in less than an hour.

06:23.272 --> 06:25.372
I expect nothing less from you.

06:26.442 --> 06:28.309
(sighs)

06:29.579 --> 06:31.512
AUBREY: <i> Park ranger was</i>
<i>telling the truth.</i>

06:31.547 --> 06:33.614
<i>Couple of hikers</i>
<i>corroborated his story.</i>

06:33.649 --> 06:37.017
But I ran a search for convicted
felons local to the area

06:37.053 --> 06:39.520
who've committed acts of
violence in a public park.

06:39.555 --> 06:40.888
That's very specific.

06:40.923 --> 06:42.923
I know, but I actually
got a hit, too.

06:42.959 --> 06:45.559
Matthew Crump, 33, multiple
assault charges, robbery...

06:45.595 --> 06:47.795
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't think so.

06:47.830 --> 06:49.496
No, it doesn't wash
that a guy like this

06:49.532 --> 06:50.865
would dump the remains
in a tree.

06:50.900 --> 06:52.366
It makes sense
if you're lazy.

06:52.401 --> 06:53.701
Chucking somebody into
a tree is a lot easier

06:53.736 --> 06:55.769
than digging
a hole, right?

06:55.805 --> 06:57.004
Right, and Sweets
would point out

06:57.039 --> 06:58.739
that this is not
some random tree, right?

06:58.774 --> 07:01.675
It's a tree where lovers went
to carve their initials in.

07:01.711 --> 07:03.244
It's a bad tree for a dump.

07:03.279 --> 07:05.379
Unless you're in love
and not thinking clearly.

07:05.414 --> 07:06.881
There you go, right?

07:06.916 --> 07:08.916
Get all the names and
the initials and the carvings,

07:08.951 --> 07:11.018
so when we get a lead,
we can move on it.

07:11.053 --> 07:13.320
Sweets, huh?

07:13.356 --> 07:15.489
Yep, Sweets.

07:17.593 --> 07:20.427
FUENTES: <i>But I have not reconstructed</i>
<i>the the skull yet.</i>

07:20.463 --> 07:22.429
You don't need a skull
for the I.D.

07:22.465 --> 07:23.931
I made scans
of the intact bones.

07:23.966 --> 07:25.366
(cell phone ringing)

07:25.401 --> 07:27.668
Oh, excuse me.

07:27.703 --> 07:29.370
I have to take this.

07:29.405 --> 07:30.537
<i>Hola.</i>

07:30.573 --> 07:32.139
(speaking Spanish)

07:36.279 --> 07:38.212
(clears throat)

07:38.247 --> 07:40.948
Uh, are you...
are you sick?

07:40.983 --> 07:42.249
Excuse me?

07:42.285 --> 07:44.285
You-you said
<i>"medicamentos."</i>

07:44.320 --> 07:46.620
That's Spanish
for medicine, right?

07:46.656 --> 07:48.789
Yes, you are
quite correct.

07:48.824 --> 07:51.158
I'm getting
over a cold.

07:51.193 --> 07:53.160
And that was
the pharmacy.

07:53.195 --> 07:55.429
You said you
have an I.D.?

07:55.464 --> 07:56.897
MONTENEGRO:
Justine Simmons.

07:56.933 --> 07:58.432
Geez, I didn't know

07:58.467 --> 08:01.135
somebody could look that good
in a license photo.

08:01.170 --> 08:03.203
That's strange-- Hodgins said
that the victim has been dead

08:03.239 --> 08:05.105
for at least a month,
but her father

08:05.141 --> 08:06.941
only reported her missing
two weeks ago.

08:06.976 --> 08:08.909
Wow, I-I'll tell Booth.

08:08.945 --> 08:10.210
You reconstruct that skull.

08:10.246 --> 08:11.779
Brennan is still gonna want

08:11.814 --> 08:14.248
cause of death.

08:17.086 --> 08:19.053
AUBREY: I'm sorry for your loss,
Pastor Simmons.

08:19.088 --> 08:21.088
Thank you,
Agent Aubrey.

08:21.123 --> 08:24.491
But as painful as this is,

08:24.527 --> 08:27.628
I believe the Lord
had a plan for Justine.

08:27.663 --> 08:29.630
Well, according to the evidence
we've gathered thus far,

08:29.665 --> 08:32.599
we believe that your daughter
was murdered about a month ago.

08:32.635 --> 08:35.436
Why did you wait two weeks
to report her missing?

08:35.471 --> 08:38.972
Justine and I were not as close
as I would have liked.

08:39.008 --> 08:40.975
The distance
between you two,

08:41.010 --> 08:43.876
was it because
of the accident?

08:43.913 --> 08:46.780
I see you've done your homework.

08:46.816 --> 08:48.782
According to the
accident report,

08:48.818 --> 08:50.784
your daughter was
driving at the time.

08:50.820 --> 08:52.453
She walked away with
barely a scratch,

08:52.488 --> 08:55.089
but you were in the
hospital for quite a while.

08:55.124 --> 08:58.092
Agent Aubrey,
this was an accident.

08:58.127 --> 09:00.127
Sir, I do hope
you're not suggesting that...

09:00.162 --> 09:01.295
No.

09:01.330 --> 09:03.697
No, of course not.

09:03.733 --> 09:07.267
So when was the last time
you saw your daughter, sir?

09:07.303 --> 09:08.702
Six weeks ago.

09:08.738 --> 09:10.104
At church.

09:10.139 --> 09:12.139
Justine had started
attending again.

09:12.174 --> 09:13.907
Wanted forgiveness.

09:13.943 --> 09:16.176
Which I took as a sign that
she was turning her life around.

09:16.212 --> 09:18.212
Was she in some
kind of trouble?

09:18.247 --> 09:19.913
Like drugs or alcohol?

09:19.949 --> 09:21.915
No, no, nothing
like that, but...

09:21.951 --> 09:23.917
(sighs)

09:23.953 --> 09:27.554
Justine made her living
as a psychic.

09:27.590 --> 09:31.191
I begged her to stop,
but she just laughed.

09:31.227 --> 09:35.229
"If a person turns to
mediums or necromancers,

09:35.264 --> 09:36.697
"whoring after them,

09:36.732 --> 09:38.632
"I will set my face
against that person

09:38.667 --> 09:41.835
and will cut him off
from among his people."

09:41.871 --> 09:44.304
Yes.

09:44.340 --> 09:46.940
Leviticus 20:6.

09:46.976 --> 09:48.742
That's very good, Agent Aubrey.

09:48.778 --> 09:50.277
So you know

09:50.312 --> 09:53.514
that Justine was playing
with fire.

09:53.549 --> 09:56.183
Quite literally.

09:59.221 --> 10:01.355
Don't do it, Angie, don't.

10:01.390 --> 10:03.290
But if this woman
was a psychic...

10:03.325 --> 10:04.691
There are no such things.

10:04.727 --> 10:06.693
You seriously don't
believe Avalon?

10:06.729 --> 10:07.995
No.

10:08.030 --> 10:10.097
Psychics
and fortune tellers

10:10.132 --> 10:13.100
represent man's basic need
to make sense of the unknown,

10:13.135 --> 10:16.770
while rigorous evidence-based
science is far more difficult

10:16.806 --> 10:19.406
than just believing
in magic.

10:19.442 --> 10:23.444
Oh, so you're saying
I'm lazy and a fool?

10:23.479 --> 10:26.647
Oh, how did I not
see that coming?

10:26.682 --> 10:28.682
(cell phone ringing)

10:28.717 --> 10:31.118
Uh, oh, my God.

10:31.153 --> 10:32.686
It's Avalon.

10:32.721 --> 10:34.688
No, I'm...

10:34.723 --> 10:37.191
I-I didn't call her. I swear!

10:37.226 --> 10:39.726
Okay.

10:41.097 --> 10:43.497
Justine's been here
just shy of a year.

10:43.532 --> 10:45.666
Good tenant, no trouble.

10:45.701 --> 10:47.167
All right. Nice place.

10:47.203 --> 10:49.403
Guess being a fortune
teller is a good gig, huh?

10:49.438 --> 10:52.473
Psychic.
And Justine was amazing, yes.

10:52.508 --> 10:55.843
Oh, so you were a client
as well as her landlord?

10:55.878 --> 10:57.211
I did a couple readings.

10:57.246 --> 10:58.278
She was incredible.

10:58.314 --> 11:00.414
Really connected, you know?

11:00.449 --> 11:02.349
No, I don't.

11:02.384 --> 11:03.417
Booth?
Yeah?

11:03.452 --> 11:05.319
This computer is cracked.

11:05.354 --> 11:07.754
There's blood on the screen.
Well, there's lots of cash here,

11:07.756 --> 11:09.890
so if she was killed here,
it definitely wasn't a robbery.

11:09.925 --> 11:12.226
I don't think
she was killed here.

11:12.261 --> 11:13.393
BRENNAN:
Avalon?

11:13.429 --> 11:14.528
What are you doing here?

11:14.563 --> 11:15.629
Yeah, what are you doing here?

11:15.664 --> 11:17.664
Did Angela call you?
No.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.166
No, I-I called her.

11:19.201 --> 11:21.101
Someone contacted me
from the other side.

11:21.137 --> 11:23.370
Said you needed my help.

11:23.405 --> 11:24.738
Right. Oh.
Uh-uh-uh!

11:24.773 --> 11:25.813
Come on, out. There we go.

11:25.841 --> 11:27.441
Okay, what's going on here?

11:27.476 --> 11:30.777
I'm Avalon Harmonia,
a psychic like the victim.

11:30.813 --> 11:33.046
You just finished
laying flooring, didn't you?

11:33.082 --> 11:35.182
Wow, you're really good.

11:35.217 --> 11:37.551
It's just your knee pads
and that pine oil smell.

11:37.586 --> 11:38.986
Yeah, sorry.

11:39.021 --> 11:40.220
The owners have me
remodeling, like,

11:40.256 --> 11:41.421
four different units
in the building.

11:41.457 --> 11:42.890
Look, Avalon, you can't be

11:42.925 --> 11:44.291
at the crime scene, all right?

11:44.326 --> 11:45.759
They don't believe.

11:45.794 --> 11:49.096
I'm sensing a great
struggle in this room.

11:49.131 --> 11:51.665
Yes, the blood evidence
told us that without having

11:51.700 --> 11:53.767
to sense anything.
There was a man

11:53.802 --> 11:56.403
who wanted to do her harm.

11:56.438 --> 11:59.306
If you can tell us that
man's name, I'll be impressed.

11:59.341 --> 12:00.707
Anthony Taylor.

12:00.743 --> 12:02.309
What?

12:02.344 --> 12:05.312
He's connected to this case.

12:05.347 --> 12:07.414
And he's a charlatan.

12:07.449 --> 12:08.782
LANDLORD:
Justine used to work with him.

12:08.817 --> 12:09.917
They had a falling out.

12:09.952 --> 12:11.084
But he came here once.
They argued.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.253
I overheard-- thin walls.

12:13.289 --> 12:14.988
I-I'm pretty sure
he threatened her.

12:15.024 --> 12:16.256
Yeah, that fits.

12:16.292 --> 12:17.791
All right, enough
with the pillows.

12:17.826 --> 12:19.593
Say, let me

12:19.628 --> 12:20.961
ask you something.

12:20.996 --> 12:22.930
Is it somebody's birthday today?

12:30.394 --> 12:32.061
MONTENEGRO:
<i>I'm sorry that</i>

12:32.096 --> 12:33.596
they don't believe,
Avalon.

12:33.631 --> 12:35.464
Oh, I'm used to it.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.800
Besides, other people's opinions

12:37.835 --> 12:40.769
don't make the truth
any less true.

12:40.805 --> 12:42.605
Right, so why am I here exactly?

12:42.640 --> 12:44.607
Because you're interrogating
the fraud,

12:44.642 --> 12:47.877
and Booth won't
let Avalon into the FBI.

12:47.912 --> 12:50.045
So you want me to subvert
protocol and risk my career

12:50.081 --> 12:51.347
by letting her
what exactly?

12:51.382 --> 12:52.882
Educate you.

12:52.917 --> 12:56.085
About how a fraud
like Anthony Taylor operates.

12:56.120 --> 12:58.153
Avalon can tell you
how he fishes for names,

12:58.189 --> 13:00.022
how he leads his subjects

13:00.057 --> 13:01.857
to reveal the answers
that he needs.

13:01.893 --> 13:03.559
So you just have to play along,

13:03.594 --> 13:06.462
and then you turn
the tables on him.

13:06.497 --> 13:08.264
Well, I thought you guys
were forbidden

13:08.299 --> 13:10.366
from revealing your secrets.

13:10.401 --> 13:12.368
She's the real deal, Aubrey.

13:12.403 --> 13:14.036
Angela, please.

13:14.071 --> 13:16.672
No offense, Ms. Harmonia, but...

13:18.509 --> 13:21.877
I don't blame someone
who's been through what you have

13:21.913 --> 13:24.780
to lack faith
in someone like me.

13:26.183 --> 13:27.950
What is that supposed to mean?

13:27.985 --> 13:32.054
Well, your dad leaving
you and your mom.

13:32.089 --> 13:34.256
Someone told you.

13:34.292 --> 13:35.858
Of course.

13:35.893 --> 13:38.561
Call her your spirit guide
or your guardian angel.

13:38.596 --> 13:40.863
Anyway, I'm sorry for your pain.

13:42.567 --> 13:45.501
But I see great things
in your future.

13:45.536 --> 13:47.503
Mostly.

13:47.538 --> 13:49.204
"M-Mostly"?

13:49.240 --> 13:51.507
All in good time.

13:54.645 --> 13:56.211
AUBREY:
<i>Because of your gift,</i>

13:56.247 --> 13:57.780
Mr. Taylor, we were hoping
you could help us

13:57.815 --> 13:58.847
with a case we're working on.

13:58.883 --> 14:00.549
Of course, of course.

14:00.585 --> 14:02.618
And we'll do our best to keep
your name out of the press.

14:02.653 --> 14:04.019
Oh, no need.

14:04.055 --> 14:06.422
The more people who know
about the power of the mind,

14:06.457 --> 14:08.591
the better off
the world is.

14:08.626 --> 14:10.693
Well, I'm sure
you can already sense

14:10.728 --> 14:12.561
who the victim might be.

14:12.597 --> 14:14.797
A moment, perhaps?

14:14.832 --> 14:17.833
Please.

14:24.308 --> 14:26.575
I'm getting...

14:26.611 --> 14:28.877
a boy.

14:31.415 --> 14:34.116
Or-or-or a young man.

14:34.151 --> 14:36.585
He could be the victim

14:36.621 --> 14:39.355
or the assailant.

14:39.390 --> 14:42.257
We know very little,
so the ball is in your court.

14:42.293 --> 14:43.425
Then it's a young man.

14:43.461 --> 14:44.994
Very good.

14:45.029 --> 14:47.763
A lot of money was kept
in the victim's apartment.

14:47.798 --> 14:50.532
Robbery. Robbery
was the motive.

14:50.568 --> 14:53.068
Greed is a powerful force.

14:53.104 --> 14:56.338
This victim was a client
of another psychic actually.

14:56.374 --> 14:58.841
A, uh... Justine Simmons?

14:58.876 --> 15:00.242
Think you might know her.

15:00.277 --> 15:01.343
Yes.

15:01.379 --> 15:03.045
She's a fraud.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.948
I hope she didn't take
advantage of him.

15:05.983 --> 15:07.583
Well, I thought you two
used to work together.

15:07.618 --> 15:12.021
I am sensing Justine
is clouding the issue here.

15:12.056 --> 15:14.723
Justine is the issue here,
Mr. Taylor.

15:14.759 --> 15:17.660
She's the victim.

15:17.695 --> 15:20.429
Something you didn't
seem to sense.

15:20.464 --> 15:22.464
Or didn't want to.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.533
You lied to me.
Yeah, well,

15:24.568 --> 15:27.836
the difference is that
lying isn't my profession.

15:27.872 --> 15:29.905
I can't give an accurate reading

15:29.940 --> 15:32.041
if there isn't
an openness between us.

15:32.076 --> 15:33.175
Oh.

15:33.210 --> 15:34.843
Okay, great. Let's be open then.

15:34.879 --> 15:37.279
Uh, you and Justine used to work
together, then a year ago,

15:37.314 --> 15:40.549
she quits and files
a restraining order against you.

15:40.584 --> 15:42.618
Justine stole some
of my clients.

15:42.653 --> 15:44.420
I lost my temper.

15:44.455 --> 15:46.021
Is that a crime?

15:46.057 --> 15:48.323
Judge thought
that it could be.

15:48.359 --> 15:51.360
Okay.

15:51.395 --> 15:53.796
She stole more than
some of my clients.

15:53.831 --> 15:57.566
She stole my methods
for contacting...

15:57.601 --> 15:59.568
You mean the tricks
that you use to take advantage

15:59.603 --> 16:01.670
of vulnerable people--
like how to do a cold read,

16:01.706 --> 16:03.872
or how to run a quick background
check on a future client?

16:03.908 --> 16:05.307
That's what Justine did.

16:05.342 --> 16:07.643
Because she didn't
have the gift like I do.

16:07.678 --> 16:09.845
She did that. And you know what?
She'd go deeper.

16:09.880 --> 16:11.714
She'd dig up dirt
on her clients.

16:11.749 --> 16:15.984
So you're saying that Justine
would blackmail her clients?

16:16.020 --> 16:19.988
It wasn't done
overtly of course.

16:21.859 --> 16:23.992
And I would never do it.

16:24.028 --> 16:25.761
But you don't think

16:25.796 --> 16:27.963
I could really
kill Justine, do you?

16:27.998 --> 16:30.966
You're the psychic.

16:31.001 --> 16:34.303
I shouldn't have to tell you
what I'm thinking.

16:38.843 --> 16:41.410
SAROYAN: <i> Avalon? I thought</i>
<i>she was barred from the FBI.</i>

16:41.445 --> 16:43.712
Well, yeah, but she can
do her work anywhere.

16:43.748 --> 16:46.148
She's been trying
to contact Justine.

16:46.183 --> 16:48.317
Oh, the dead person.

16:48.352 --> 16:50.753
Is that a local or a
long-distance call?

16:50.788 --> 16:52.020
Oh, great.

16:52.056 --> 16:53.689
So you think
I'm a loon now, too?

16:53.724 --> 16:55.424
But you're great
with a computer.

16:55.459 --> 16:57.493
So what did you find?

16:58.429 --> 17:00.195
Okay, so...

17:00.231 --> 17:01.864
here are the documents
that the victim pulled

17:01.899 --> 17:03.365
when she did
background checks

17:03.400 --> 17:05.800
on all of her clients.
Smart racket.

17:05.836 --> 17:08.503
Any idea how many of these
clients she was blackmailing?

17:08.539 --> 17:11.540
Well, it's hard to say,
but there's a lot of them.

17:11.575 --> 17:15.410
The blood on the screen,
that was definitely hers, right?

17:15.445 --> 17:17.179
The DNA was
a match, yeah.

17:17.214 --> 17:18.847
That's good for us.
When the computer broke,

17:18.883 --> 17:22.416
the time stamp froze
at 1:07 p.m. on the 12th,

17:22.453 --> 17:24.853
which means I might
have time of death.

17:24.888 --> 17:26.221
Or at least
time of assault.

17:26.257 --> 17:27.689
I'll tell Booth.

17:29.760 --> 17:33.495
And for the record,
I don't think you're a loon.

17:33.531 --> 17:37.199
My grandmother
was a believer.

17:37.234 --> 17:40.068
After my grandfather died,
she visited psychics,

17:40.104 --> 17:42.070
hoping to talk to him
one last time.

17:42.106 --> 17:43.739
I mean, she...

17:43.774 --> 17:46.942
she spent thousands.

17:46.977 --> 17:50.112
Yeah, the fakes,
people like Justine and Taylor,

17:50.147 --> 17:52.080
they just prey on people

17:52.116 --> 17:54.383
when they're
at their most vulnerable.

17:55.452 --> 17:58.487
You know what I hate the most?

17:58.522 --> 18:01.824
Knowing that all she had to do
was call me, you know?

18:01.859 --> 18:04.593
We could've talked about him.

18:07.832 --> 18:11.667
Kept him alive together.

18:11.702 --> 18:15.270
And it wouldn't have
cost her a dime.

18:15.306 --> 18:17.573
Yeah.

18:28.052 --> 18:30.252
Dr. Fuentes,
where have you been?

18:30.287 --> 18:31.820
I know I'm late.

18:31.856 --> 18:33.288
Sorry, I, um,

18:33.324 --> 18:36.024
I just had some personal
business to take care of.

18:36.060 --> 18:38.427
But it's not
gonna happen again.

18:39.396 --> 18:40.896
Whatever that
business is,

18:40.931 --> 18:42.698
it's clearly lucrative.

18:44.368 --> 18:46.835
Look, if you're not interested
in working here

18:46.871 --> 18:49.204
for an intern's salary...
Well, no, no, no!

18:49.240 --> 18:50.739
Of course I do. I...

18:50.774 --> 18:52.207
Allow me to apologize.

18:52.243 --> 18:54.610
It will not happen again.
I promise.

18:54.645 --> 18:56.612
We've wasted enough time.

18:58.649 --> 19:01.450
Why isn't the reconstruction
of the skull completed?

19:01.485 --> 19:03.385
Well, I'm still
waiting on more fragments

19:03.420 --> 19:06.521
from Dr. Hodgins,
but I did find

19:06.557 --> 19:09.157
a Monteggia fracture on
the proximal shaft

19:09.193 --> 19:10.726
of the ulna,
and that is in addition

19:10.761 --> 19:13.095
to a dislocation
to the head of the radius

19:13.130 --> 19:15.731
and the fractures
on the metacarpals.

19:15.766 --> 19:17.699
So the victim clearly fought back.
Mm-hmm.

19:17.735 --> 19:20.569
The blood on the laptop
was definitely Justine's,

19:20.604 --> 19:24.006
but there's no signs of
forced entry into her apartment.

19:24.041 --> 19:25.974
Oh, implying that the victim
might have been attacked

19:26.010 --> 19:27.709
by someone close to her.

19:30.414 --> 19:31.980
So while you were talking
to the Amazing Kreskin,

19:32.016 --> 19:33.315
I was doing this.

19:33.350 --> 19:34.950
Running serial numbers
on hundred dollar bills?

19:34.985 --> 19:36.952
It's money from Justine's apartment.
Oh.

19:36.987 --> 19:38.754
And they're sequential.
Yeah, they're brand-new.

19:38.789 --> 19:41.757
Federal Reserve traced it
to a small bank in Rockville.

19:41.792 --> 19:44.126
Withdrawing 3,000 bucks
from a small branch

19:44.161 --> 19:45.694
in a little town might
be memorable, right?

19:45.729 --> 19:47.529
I'll go talk to the tellers,
see if they remember

19:47.564 --> 19:48.797
who they gave
the bills to.

19:48.832 --> 19:49.998
I already did that.

19:50.034 --> 19:51.366
Customer's name is
Alana Jackson.

19:51.402 --> 19:52.834
Let me guess--
Alana Jackson

19:52.870 --> 19:54.636
is a client of
Justine Simmons.

19:54.672 --> 19:56.738
Ah, you are psychic.
Okay, let's go.

20:01.245 --> 20:03.545
BOOTH:
Alana Jackson?

20:03.580 --> 20:05.480
FBI. Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

20:05.516 --> 20:07.449
This here is
Agent Aubrey.

20:07.484 --> 20:09.151
Oh, my God. My kids.

20:09.186 --> 20:11.119
Are my kids okay?
Yes, ma'am.

20:11.155 --> 20:13.021
We're not here about them.
We need to ask you

20:13.057 --> 20:15.324
a couple of questions
about Justine Simmons.

20:15.359 --> 20:18.961
We found her body
at Roosevelt National Park.

20:18.996 --> 20:20.429
We suspect murder.

20:20.464 --> 20:21.797
That's...

20:21.832 --> 20:22.965
Oh, my God.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.499
We have reason
to believe that

20:24.535 --> 20:26.001
that she was blackmailing you,
and we know

20:26.036 --> 20:28.103
that you gave her
$3,000 last month.

20:28.138 --> 20:29.504
Blackmail? No.

20:29.540 --> 20:31.239
She-she just told me
that she needed money,

20:31.275 --> 20:32.541
so I gave it to her.

20:32.576 --> 20:33.642
Wow.

20:33.677 --> 20:34.810
Pretty generous of you.

20:34.845 --> 20:36.511
I was grateful to her.

20:36.547 --> 20:39.047
She'd call upon spirit guides
to protect my husband.

20:39.083 --> 20:41.984
He's serving his third tour
in Afghanistan.

20:42.019 --> 20:43.485
She was, um...

20:45.789 --> 20:47.255
She and I became close.

20:47.291 --> 20:49.891
So, um...

20:49.927 --> 20:51.159
Oh, my God.

20:51.195 --> 20:53.929
I can't believe she's gone.

20:55.466 --> 20:59.568
You two were more than friends,
weren't you?

21:02.706 --> 21:04.740
What do you mean?

21:04.775 --> 21:06.455
Look, I've been doing
this job a long time,

21:06.477 --> 21:07.909
and I know people react

21:07.945 --> 21:09.811
when they've heard
that a loved one is dead.

21:13.450 --> 21:14.850
Did she threaten

21:14.885 --> 21:16.752
to tell your husband
about your affair?

21:17.654 --> 21:18.820
No.

21:18.856 --> 21:20.655
God, no.

21:20.691 --> 21:23.458
Besides, Justine and I stopped
seeing each other a while ago.

21:23.494 --> 21:25.560
Who broke it off?
Justine.

21:25.596 --> 21:27.229
I told her
I'd do anything for her.

21:27.264 --> 21:30.265
I-I'd leave my husband,
I'd start a new life.

21:30.300 --> 21:31.967
But she said no.

21:32.002 --> 21:33.902
That must have made you
pretty upset.

21:33.937 --> 21:35.604
It did.

21:37.408 --> 21:39.775
But that doesn't mean
I killed her.

21:39.810 --> 21:41.843
All right, can you account
for your whereabouts last month

21:41.879 --> 21:43.311
on the 12th
around 1:00?

21:43.347 --> 21:45.313
Uh...

21:45.349 --> 21:48.283
See, um...

21:48.318 --> 21:50.052
I was training
for a triathlon that day.

21:50.087 --> 21:51.686
With 14 other people.

21:51.722 --> 21:53.722
I can... I can give you
their names if you'd like.

21:53.757 --> 21:55.824
Yeah, we'd appreciate that.

21:55.859 --> 21:58.293
Now, uh... unless you have
any other questions,

21:58.328 --> 22:01.263
I really need to pick up my kids
from soccer practice.

22:01.298 --> 22:03.265
When you can, get
those numbers to us.

22:03.300 --> 22:05.400
Yes, sir.

22:05.436 --> 22:07.002
Uh...

22:07.037 --> 22:08.937
You spoke to her father, right?

22:08.972 --> 22:11.406
I can't imagine what he'd do
if he found out

22:11.442 --> 22:14.076
that she and I
were having an affair.

22:18.379 --> 22:20.379
MONTENEGRO:
<i>So you contacted Justine?</i>

22:20.415 --> 22:21.747
Did she say who killed her?

22:21.783 --> 22:23.316
She wouldn't say.

22:23.351 --> 22:25.651
Lots of crying going
on with her though.

22:25.687 --> 22:26.953
Well, why didn't she say?

22:26.988 --> 22:29.589
She said she hurt
enough people,

22:29.624 --> 22:32.858
and that her death was
her own fault, poor thing.

22:32.894 --> 22:34.160
Oh, hello, Avalon.

22:34.195 --> 22:35.494
It's good to see you.

22:35.530 --> 22:37.563
Not in connection
to the case, of course,

22:37.599 --> 22:39.665
but because I
kind of like you.

22:39.701 --> 22:41.367
She contacted Justine.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.970
But Justine won't say
who killed her.

22:44.005 --> 22:45.938
She doesn't want to get
anybody in trouble.

22:45.974 --> 22:48.541
Gee, fancy that,
not having an answer.

22:48.576 --> 22:49.976
I did hear from
your friend though.

22:50.011 --> 22:50.943
The psychologist.

22:50.979 --> 22:52.345
Avalon, no.

22:52.380 --> 22:54.480
Don't. Not Sweets.

22:54.481 --> 22:54.919
Hodgins...

22:54.943 --> 22:57.453
No, Angie, she is not gonna
use Sweets like this, okay?

22:57.454 --> 23:01.352
Avalon, just let
him rest in peace.

23:02.290 --> 23:05.057
Not another word.

23:10.565 --> 23:13.232
So you really had
contact with Sweets?

23:13.268 --> 23:14.500
Yeah.

23:14.535 --> 23:17.069
He's having a real tough day.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.704
Yeah, it-it's his birthday.

23:18.740 --> 23:19.972
Yeah.

23:20.008 --> 23:22.541
I hear the first one's
always tough.

23:28.149 --> 23:29.482
Aubrey, what do you got?

23:29.517 --> 23:31.517
Oh, hey,
what do you got there?

23:31.552 --> 23:33.819
Oh, these are just some
doughnuts I got from Georgetown.

23:33.855 --> 23:36.255
Oh, great, I still got
room in my leg.

23:36.291 --> 23:38.324
Yeah, I promised Sweets
that I would treat him

23:38.359 --> 23:39.692
to some on his birthday.

23:39.727 --> 23:42.361
Oh.
Yeah.

23:42.397 --> 23:45.031
Would have felt weird not
to get them, you know?

23:45.066 --> 23:47.833
Yeah, I do.

23:49.604 --> 23:52.605
Well, it would also be wrong
not to eat them though.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.840
Yeah, you know what?

23:54.876 --> 23:56.442
You're right.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.377
There it is.

24:00.315 --> 24:01.881
Mmm.

24:01.916 --> 24:03.749
So what do
you got there?

24:03.785 --> 24:05.318
Right, murder.

24:05.353 --> 24:07.620
So I compared Justine's
financial statements

24:07.655 --> 24:09.889
to the bank records
that she kept on her computer

24:09.924 --> 24:11.924
so I could find out
her most frequent clients.

24:11.959 --> 24:13.359
And when you say
"frequent clients,"

24:13.361 --> 24:14.760
you mean blackmail
victims.

24:14.796 --> 24:16.729
Or other intimate
relationships.

24:16.764 --> 24:18.564
So I checked social media,
cross-referencing

24:18.599 --> 24:20.399
Justine's name
with the client's name.

24:20.435 --> 24:22.201
Whoa, whoa, slow down, you're
sounding very squinty right now.

24:22.236 --> 24:25.137
Child of the '90s, you know;
computers are kind of our thing.

24:25.173 --> 24:27.206
This doughnut is
blowing my mind.

24:27.241 --> 24:28.808
What, you only got these six?

24:28.843 --> 24:31.477
Aubrey, please just continue
on with the information.

24:31.512 --> 24:34.880
Right, okay,
so what I got was this.

24:34.916 --> 24:36.849
BOOTH: Wait a second,
that's her father's church.

24:36.884 --> 24:40.219
You're gonna tell me all these
ladies go to the same church?

24:40.254 --> 24:41.821
Justine Simmons
didn't go back to church

24:41.856 --> 24:44.857
looking for forgiveness, she
went back looking for clients.

24:44.892 --> 24:46.625
You know, maybe Alana
was right, you know?

24:46.661 --> 24:49.628
We should, uh, talk
to her father again.

24:53.701 --> 24:56.435
This piece of tissue
Dr. Hodgins found is

24:56.471 --> 24:57.870
from the
victim's scalp.

24:57.905 --> 24:59.705
And it's exhibiting
a significant amount

24:59.741 --> 25:02.441
of ecchymosis.
Bruising.

25:02.477 --> 25:05.177
I'm thinking this correlates
with cause of death.

25:05.213 --> 25:07.213
So you would like me
to match that tissue

25:07.248 --> 25:09.248
with the proper location
on the cranial surface?

25:09.283 --> 25:11.250
Exactly.

25:11.285 --> 25:12.585
Wow, you did a wonderful job

25:12.620 --> 25:13.919
reconstructing this skull,
Dr. Fuentes.

25:13.955 --> 25:15.321
Thank you.

25:15.356 --> 25:17.890
Even though you've been
distracted and late.

25:17.925 --> 25:21.327
As I said earlier,
a million apologies.

25:21.362 --> 25:24.029
You found the location
where the tissue came from?

25:24.065 --> 25:25.197
Yes.

25:25.233 --> 25:26.866
The occipital.

25:26.901 --> 25:29.635
FUENTES:
Well, that's interesting.

25:29.670 --> 25:31.170
There's a hairline
fracture here.

25:31.205 --> 25:32.772
Perimortem.

25:32.807 --> 25:35.341
So cause of death could have
been blunt force trauma.

25:35.376 --> 25:38.310
Well, the curvature of the
fracture is almost semicircular,

25:38.346 --> 25:41.180
suggesting that the weapon is
some sort of cylindrical object.

25:41.215 --> 25:42.648
A pipe?
No.

25:42.683 --> 25:44.817
Metal would have caused
a lot more damage.

25:44.852 --> 25:48.387
It's most likely a
lighter polymer or wood.

25:48.423 --> 25:49.555
A cane?

25:49.590 --> 25:51.257
Yeah.

25:51.292 --> 25:52.792
Didn't Agent Aubrey say
that Justine's father

25:52.827 --> 25:54.860
uses a cane ever since
the car accident?

25:56.431 --> 26:00.433
You can't possibly believe
I killed my own daughter.

26:00.468 --> 26:02.635
I am a man of God, Agent Aubrey.

26:02.670 --> 26:05.404
Lots of killing and retribution
in the Bible, Pastor.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.039
"As for the faithless,
the sorcerers,

26:07.074 --> 26:09.375
"their portion will be
in the lake that burns

26:09.410 --> 26:12.411
with fire and sulfur,
which is the second death."

26:12.447 --> 26:14.280
Revelation 21:8.

26:14.315 --> 26:16.182
Huh.

26:16.217 --> 26:18.517
You're really up on your
Bible, Agent Aubrey.

26:18.553 --> 26:20.486
Minored in religion in college.

26:20.521 --> 26:24.089
So you add her sexual
orientation to the, uh, sorcery,

26:24.125 --> 26:26.592
I'm thinking we've got us
a lethal combination.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.594
(sighs)

26:28.629 --> 26:33.165
Justine came out to me
when she was 16 years old.

26:34.769 --> 26:38.337
I supported her
then as I do now.

26:38.372 --> 26:41.340
These passages you
quote, Agent Aubrey,

26:41.375 --> 26:43.409
they pale next to
the real message

26:43.444 --> 26:45.778
that Jesus brought to us--

26:45.813 --> 26:49.014
understanding,
compassion and love.

26:53.287 --> 26:56.255
I am not God, Agent Aubrey.

26:56.290 --> 26:59.191
It's not for me to judge.

26:59.227 --> 27:02.895
I hope you're telling
the truth, Pastor.

27:02.930 --> 27:04.697
I really do.

27:04.732 --> 27:07.266
But we need to take
your cane into evidence.

27:08.503 --> 27:11.537
I'm afraid I can't
let you do that.

27:11.572 --> 27:14.406
This cane was a
gift from Justine.

27:14.442 --> 27:17.076
Yeah, well, uh, you don't
really have a choice, sir,

27:17.111 --> 27:20.012
because we have a warrant.

27:44.780 --> 27:47.347
This came for you.

27:47.382 --> 27:48.548
It was opened?

27:48.583 --> 27:49.950
Why was it opened?

27:49.985 --> 27:51.351
Because opening
suspicious packages

27:51.386 --> 27:52.686
in a government facility
is recommended

27:52.721 --> 27:53.853
by Homeland Security.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.422
Wh-What is suspicious
about this?

27:55.457 --> 27:56.823
Dr. Fuentes, stop.

27:56.858 --> 27:58.625
There are drugs in here,
prescription drugs.

27:58.660 --> 28:00.894
And taking into account
the cash that I saw you with

28:00.929 --> 28:02.595
and the fact that Angela
overheard you

28:02.631 --> 28:03.596
talking about medication...

28:03.632 --> 28:04.898
I am not selling drugs,

28:04.933 --> 28:06.166
if that's what
you're saying.

28:06.201 --> 28:07.667
Do you have
a better explanation?

28:07.703 --> 28:09.636
That money wasn't for me,
it was for bribes.

28:09.671 --> 28:11.604
Okay, this is not
sounding better, Dr. Fuentes.

28:11.640 --> 28:14.841
These drugs, they
are prescriptions,

28:14.876 --> 28:16.843
donated by Cubans
living here in America.

28:16.878 --> 28:19.245
I am shipping them to
a doctor I know in Cuba

28:19.281 --> 28:21.081
who needs them
for his patients.

28:21.116 --> 28:24.718
The money is for bribes for
customs officials in Cuba.

28:24.753 --> 28:26.186
I thought health care
in Cuba was free.

28:26.221 --> 28:28.855
It is, but
medicines are not.

28:28.890 --> 28:30.824
There are very few,
and they're expensive.

28:30.859 --> 28:32.659
Okay, well,
this is still smuggling.

28:32.694 --> 28:34.961
And I can't condone that
or ignore it.

28:34.997 --> 28:37.030
But we are still talking
about saving lives

28:37.065 --> 28:38.965
and relieving suffering.

28:39.001 --> 28:41.267
Is-is that wrong, no
matter what the law says?

28:41.303 --> 28:43.503
No, uh, but yes,
uh, the law...

28:43.538 --> 28:45.572
The law is wrong.

28:47.275 --> 28:49.242
These are my people.

28:49.277 --> 28:51.611
They have suffered enough.

28:59.421 --> 29:02.455
The estimated circumference
to the damage to occipital

29:02.491 --> 29:04.024
is 88 millimeters,

29:04.059 --> 29:06.459
which does not match
the pastor's cane.

29:06.495 --> 29:09.295
I will leave my notes
for the next intern.

29:09.331 --> 29:10.897
Where are you going?

29:10.932 --> 29:12.465
I haven't made
a decision yet.

29:12.501 --> 29:15.502
We both know
what you have to do.

29:15.537 --> 29:17.337
I'm gonna make it
easier for you.

29:17.372 --> 29:20.306
It has been an honor
and a pleasure.

29:20.342 --> 29:22.642
And I'm sorry it had
to end this way.

29:31.753 --> 29:34.954
Maybe if I could have gotten
Justine to open up.

29:34.990 --> 29:36.556
(sighs)

29:36.591 --> 29:38.591
But there's only
so much I can do.

29:38.627 --> 29:41.161
It's not your
fault, Avalon.

29:41.196 --> 29:45.231
It's just, Sweets seems
more present to me.

29:45.267 --> 29:47.734
I always go back to him.

29:47.769 --> 29:49.502
HODGINS: I found feces
from every arboreous animal

29:49.538 --> 29:51.471
you can imagine,
plus insects.

29:51.506 --> 29:54.607
<i>Aedes albopictus,</i>
<i>Ceratopogonidae, Chironomidae.</i>

29:54.643 --> 29:56.042
That's great.
Yeah.

29:56.078 --> 29:58.111
And I ran a postmortem
on all the insects.

29:58.146 --> 29:59.979
A bug autopsy?

30:00.015 --> 30:01.981
That's right, yeah,
and one of them was murdered.

30:02.017 --> 30:03.116
Well, before you go

30:03.151 --> 30:05.185
and declare yourself
king of the lab,

30:05.220 --> 30:06.853
I have some reading for you.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.655
Wh-What is this?

30:08.690 --> 30:12.592
So you said there's no evidence
that psychics are real.

30:12.627 --> 30:15.929
But for generations,
physicists have believed

30:15.964 --> 30:17.964
that nothing could
move as fast as light.

30:17.999 --> 30:19.933
But now they've
discovered neutrinos.

30:19.968 --> 30:23.670
Lister proved that bacterial
infections could kill,

30:23.705 --> 30:26.806
but doctors still wouldn't wash
their hands before operating

30:26.842 --> 30:29.642
because they'd convinced
themselves it was foolishness.

30:29.678 --> 30:32.779
A solar eclipse was magic
before we understood it.

30:32.814 --> 30:34.681
Great, so you did
your research.

30:34.716 --> 30:36.116
Yeah.

30:36.151 --> 30:40.420
The impossible becomes
reality all the time.

30:40.455 --> 30:44.090
Ideas and memories
and love--

30:44.126 --> 30:46.693
I mean, you can't hold
those things in your hands,

30:46.728 --> 30:50.597
but it doesn't mean
that they don't exist.

30:50.632 --> 30:53.600
So why not spirits?

30:53.635 --> 30:57.504
And why not Sweets?

30:57.539 --> 31:00.540
Y-You don't have to
believe, I-I get it,

31:00.575 --> 31:04.978
but y-you don't have to dismiss
the possibility, either.

31:05.013 --> 31:07.747
No decent scientist
would do that.

31:09.684 --> 31:11.684
(sighs)

31:11.720 --> 31:13.219
Avalon...

31:17.259 --> 31:18.725
I'm sorry.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.195
And I love you, Angela.

31:22.230 --> 31:25.865
Professor, I didn't
see that one coming.

31:25.901 --> 31:28.668
And that's hard for
a psychic to say.

31:28.703 --> 31:30.236
That's it?

31:30.272 --> 31:31.471
Yeah.

31:31.506 --> 31:32.805
You're right.

31:32.841 --> 31:36.376
So... "I love you"
about says it all.

31:40.015 --> 31:41.114
Want to hear about the bug?

31:41.149 --> 31:43.116
I guess.
All right.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.951
So he got hit by a car.

31:44.986 --> 31:46.452
He splattered
onto the windshield.

31:46.488 --> 31:49.155
I actually found
windshield wiper fluid on him.

31:49.191 --> 31:51.791
So how did the bug
end up inside the tree?

31:51.826 --> 31:53.860
Well, I think
that the killer

31:53.895 --> 31:56.729
actually dragged Justine
onto the car

31:56.765 --> 31:57.964
in order to get the height

31:57.999 --> 31:59.566
to push her into
the hollow of the tree.

31:59.601 --> 32:01.935
That's genius, Hodgins.
Yeah.

32:01.970 --> 32:03.903
The problem is
that I still have this trace

32:03.939 --> 32:05.738
that doesn't fit
into the scenario.

32:05.774 --> 32:09.309
It's a polyurea grease
and an acrylic urethane adhesive

32:09.344 --> 32:11.244
used when installing
new flooring.

32:11.279 --> 32:13.613
Oh, my.
HODGINS: What?

32:13.648 --> 32:16.049
He says,
with an entirely open mind.

32:16.084 --> 32:17.550
AVALON:
The landlady.

32:17.586 --> 32:20.887
She was repairing a floor
while we were there.

32:22.190 --> 32:25.058
And I sensed that
through my eyes and nose.

32:27.829 --> 32:29.062
Where's my intern?

32:29.097 --> 32:30.263
Oh. Yes.

32:30.298 --> 32:31.497
Dr. Fuentes left.

32:31.533 --> 32:32.732
He admitted
that he was

32:32.767 --> 32:33.967
attempting to smuggle

32:34.002 --> 32:35.435
prescription drugs into Cuba.

32:35.470 --> 32:36.703
Well, that explains that.

32:36.738 --> 32:37.971
Yes.

32:38.006 --> 32:39.872
I would do the same
thing if I were him.

32:39.908 --> 32:41.608
They lack
basic medicines.

32:41.643 --> 32:43.409
Please tell him to come back.
We have a murder to solve.

32:43.445 --> 32:46.012
But, Dr. Brennan...
And we might be working late.

32:49.918 --> 32:52.418
AUBREY: <i> We tested the equipment</i>
<i>that you use</i>

32:52.454 --> 32:54.520
to fix the flooring
in the building,

32:54.556 --> 32:56.990
and your mallet caused
the victim's injuries

32:57.025 --> 32:59.926
and tested positive
for her blood.

32:59.961 --> 33:01.928
So your move next.
No.

33:01.963 --> 33:03.096
You guys got it all wrong.

33:03.131 --> 33:04.664
I didn't kill Justine.
Right.

33:04.699 --> 33:06.099
So somebody stole your mallet,

33:06.134 --> 33:08.534
then killed Justine with it,
and then what?

33:08.570 --> 33:10.503
Planted it back on you?

33:10.538 --> 33:11.704
Okay, I shouldn't have lied.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.039
But I was scared
that you would think

33:13.074 --> 33:14.307
that I killed Justine.

33:14.342 --> 33:16.376
We do.

33:16.411 --> 33:19.012
Justine and I fought.

33:19.047 --> 33:20.947
Let's call it a lovers' quarrel.

33:20.982 --> 33:22.815
Wait, you were
sleeping with her, too?

33:22.851 --> 33:25.184
Well, it was more than that.
I mean, I loved her,

33:25.220 --> 33:26.619
and I thought she loved me, too.

33:26.655 --> 33:29.489
Until you found out you
were just one of many.

33:29.524 --> 33:31.157
(sighs)

33:31.192 --> 33:33.493
I was fixing a leaky pipe
in the unit next door.

33:33.528 --> 33:35.495
Okay? The walls
are really thin.

33:35.530 --> 33:37.297
I overheard her on the phone
telling someone

33:37.332 --> 33:39.399
that she loved them more than
she'd loved anyone before,

33:39.434 --> 33:40.633
and I just freaked.

33:40.669 --> 33:42.402
You ran over
to her place.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.103
We started screaming
at each other,

33:44.139 --> 33:48.007
she shoved me,
and I was just so pissed...

33:48.043 --> 33:51.744
I was so pissed that
I just kind of, accidentally,

33:51.780 --> 33:54.180
threw my mallet at her head.

33:54.215 --> 33:56.282
You hit her
right in the head.

33:56.318 --> 33:57.817
I know.

33:57.852 --> 34:00.019
I know, it's...
it's hard to aim a hammer.

34:00.055 --> 34:01.521
But it didn't kill her.

34:01.556 --> 34:04.223
I mean, not even close.

34:04.259 --> 34:06.392
She was very much alive.
She started whaling on me

34:06.428 --> 34:08.594
with those damn peace crystals
of hers. Look.

34:09.931 --> 34:11.397
And then what?

34:11.433 --> 34:12.831
And then nothing.

34:12.867 --> 34:15.201
We were both bleeding,
so we just stopped.

34:15.235 --> 34:18.304
And that's when I realized
that Justine was crazy

34:18.340 --> 34:20.373
and I was better off
without her.

34:20.408 --> 34:22.608
So I left.

34:22.643 --> 34:25.110
With her very, very much alive

34:25.146 --> 34:27.780
and cussing at me
the whole time.

34:31.706 --> 34:33.672
Dr. Fuentes!
Excellent.

34:33.708 --> 34:35.908
I'm glad Dr. Saroyan was able
to find you so quickly.

34:35.944 --> 34:37.409
She didn't.

34:37.445 --> 34:39.344
I left without telling you
my latest findings.

34:39.380 --> 34:42.614
I found a small fracture
on the victim's occipital

34:42.650 --> 34:44.751
where she was struck
by a cylindrical object.

34:44.786 --> 34:46.152
Yes, that was caused
by the mallet

34:46.187 --> 34:47.987
that was thrown at her
by the landlady.

34:48.023 --> 34:49.188
No, not this one.

34:49.224 --> 34:50.690
Oh. Dr. Fuentes.
It's okay.

34:50.725 --> 34:52.058
I'm leaving.
No, it's not.

34:52.092 --> 34:53.458
I need him here.
You think I didn't

34:53.495 --> 34:55.561
look for a way
to keep Dr. Fuentes here?

34:55.597 --> 34:56.862
But I have responsibilities,

34:56.898 --> 34:58.231
Dr. Brennan,
even more than you...

34:58.266 --> 34:59.866
Dr. Saroyan, it's okay.

34:59.901 --> 35:02.201
I am here for the medications
which you confiscated.

35:02.237 --> 35:04.570
I'm afraid that
won't be possible.

35:04.606 --> 35:06.506
You threw them away?

35:06.541 --> 35:08.875
As a doctor,
I had the legal right to...

35:08.910 --> 35:10.410
I didn't throw them away.
I arranged for them

35:10.445 --> 35:11.811
to be smuggled
to your doctor friend in Cuba

35:11.846 --> 35:13.913
through Booth's
friend at the CIA.

35:13.948 --> 35:16.249
(laughs)

35:16.284 --> 35:17.884
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

35:19.754 --> 35:21.020
You took the drugs
from my office?

35:21.056 --> 35:24.123
If that's a problem,
I imagine...

35:24.159 --> 35:26.759
you will have to
fire me as well.

35:26.795 --> 35:28.261
Why would she fire you?

35:28.296 --> 35:29.796
You don't have any evidence.

35:29.831 --> 35:32.231
It's gone. Isn't it?

35:32.267 --> 35:33.466
What?

35:33.501 --> 35:34.501
I was raised

35:34.502 --> 35:35.735
with Cuban justice,

35:35.770 --> 35:37.470
which allows me
to see the loopholes.

35:37.505 --> 35:38.805
He's correct.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.339
All you could do is start

35:40.375 --> 35:42.909
a long, protracted
dismissal hearing,

35:42.944 --> 35:45.411
which would rely
on your word against mine.

35:50.351 --> 35:53.319
Then, because of this loophole,

35:53.354 --> 35:55.521
I might have acted in error.

35:55.557 --> 35:57.056
Although, next time,

35:57.092 --> 35:59.826
you should try to hone
your covert skills, okay?

35:59.861 --> 36:01.360
Of course.

36:01.396 --> 36:02.962
If there are no further
interruptions...

36:06.935 --> 36:08.801
You're right,
Dr. Fuentes.

36:08.837 --> 36:11.671
This fracture is
not from the mallet,

36:11.706 --> 36:14.207
although its proximity
to the mallet strike

36:14.242 --> 36:15.808
does give us
cause of death.

36:15.844 --> 36:17.410
Very good.

36:17.445 --> 36:19.445
But the damage is too small
to be of significance.

36:19.481 --> 36:22.515
No, not if the mallet blow could
have caused a subdural hematoma.

36:22.550 --> 36:23.749
Brilliant.

36:23.785 --> 36:25.017
FUENTES:
The blood would accumulate

36:25.053 --> 36:27.453
and expand
in the intracranial space

36:27.489 --> 36:30.490
until something caused it
to rupture and kill her.

36:30.525 --> 36:32.458
The small, sharp force blow
you discovered

36:32.494 --> 36:33.860
is more than enough.

36:33.895 --> 36:35.361
Get the skull to Dr. Hodgins

36:35.396 --> 36:37.530
and have him swab
this new damage immediately.

36:37.565 --> 36:39.599
And welcome back, Dr. Fuentes.

36:42.971 --> 36:45.705
Do you know
where Sweets' car is?

36:45.740 --> 36:47.106
Uh, Sweets' car?

36:47.142 --> 36:48.908
What does that have to do
with the case?

36:48.943 --> 36:50.276
N-Nothing.

36:50.311 --> 36:51.978
I-I don't think
I'm here for the case.

36:52.013 --> 36:54.580
Your friend wants me
to drive his car.

36:54.616 --> 36:55.815
Right away.

36:55.850 --> 36:57.416
He said it has
to be right away.

36:57.452 --> 37:00.953
Okay. Um, maybe because
Daisy's selling it today.

37:00.989 --> 37:03.756
And for some reason, he wants me
to drive with my thumbs.

37:03.791 --> 37:05.992
Drive it with your thumbs?
Yes.

37:06.027 --> 37:07.660
That was very clear.

37:07.695 --> 37:10.830
He kept saying, "Drive thumb,
drive thumb, drive thumb."

37:10.865 --> 37:11.797
Oh, no, no.

37:11.833 --> 37:13.032
Not "drive thumb."

37:13.067 --> 37:14.333
Thumb drive.

37:14.369 --> 37:15.835
There must be
a thumb drive

37:15.870 --> 37:17.803
in the car
that he doesn't want to lose

37:17.839 --> 37:19.539
when Daisy sells it.
Oh.

37:19.574 --> 37:21.140
You're good.
Come on, we have

37:21.176 --> 37:24.243
to get to that car before
Daisy gets rid of it.

37:24.279 --> 37:25.745
So I found grease residue
in the fracture.

37:25.780 --> 37:26.979
Grease?

37:27.015 --> 37:28.247
Are we talking
French fries, a burger...?

37:28.283 --> 37:29.549
Polyurea grease.

37:29.584 --> 37:31.017
Ooh. Sounds delicious.

37:31.052 --> 37:33.186
Yeah, if you like the
taste of bicycle chain.

37:33.221 --> 37:34.754
That's what they use
to lubricate them.

37:34.789 --> 37:37.190
So the victim
was hit by a bicycle?

37:37.225 --> 37:38.624
Probably a girl's bike,

37:38.660 --> 37:40.860
judging from the fleck of
pink, rust-proof enamel.

37:40.895 --> 37:43.062
But I tied it to a
maker of kids' bikes,

37:43.097 --> 37:45.464
Hardy Bike and Toy.
Look at this.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.500
The enamel also
contained bug residue.

37:47.535 --> 37:49.135
The same bug residue
found on the victim?

37:49.170 --> 37:50.536
You got it.

37:52.874 --> 37:53.874
(door opens)

37:53.875 --> 37:56.075
How long is this
gonna take?

37:56.110 --> 37:58.411
I have to pick
my kids up by 5:00.

37:58.446 --> 38:01.247
Well, you might want to arrange
a babysitter long-term.

38:01.282 --> 38:03.516
What does that mean?

38:03.551 --> 38:05.952
It means that we have proof
that you killed your girlfriend.

38:05.987 --> 38:08.621
Your daughter's bike tested
positive for blood in the chain.

38:08.656 --> 38:09.922
Justine Simmons' blood.

38:11.392 --> 38:13.559
Okay, I can explain.

38:13.595 --> 38:16.028
It's... it's not what you think.

38:16.064 --> 38:17.730
What we think is that
you fought with Justine

38:17.765 --> 38:18.998
and you killed her.

38:19.033 --> 38:20.733
Then you dumped her body
into the tree.

38:20.768 --> 38:23.336
The same tree that
you carved your initials in.

38:23.371 --> 38:26.439
So... are we missing something?

38:33.147 --> 38:35.181
I did not mean to do it.

38:35.216 --> 38:38.584
Look, Justine-- she came over
and broke up with me.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.953
Then she wanted
to hug it out,

38:40.989 --> 38:42.955
to let our
energies commune.

38:42.991 --> 38:45.091
Our whole relationship, it...

38:45.126 --> 38:47.326
it was just a lie.

38:47.362 --> 38:49.962
But I did not
mean to kill her.

38:51.532 --> 38:55.268
I didn't even push her hard,
I swear, I just...

38:55.303 --> 38:57.303
It was just a little push.

38:59.641 --> 39:03.476
But when she dropped, sh...

39:03.511 --> 39:05.278
She was...

39:05.313 --> 39:07.013
AUBREY:
See, it didn't take much.

39:07.048 --> 39:09.582
Justine got in a fight with
someone else two days earlier

39:09.617 --> 39:11.150
and suffered a head injury.

39:11.185 --> 39:13.486
That's why she died
from hitting the bike.

39:13.521 --> 39:15.821
That's good then. I...

39:15.857 --> 39:17.723
It's not my fault.

39:17.759 --> 39:20.092
I'm innocent, right?

39:23.264 --> 39:25.965
Right?

39:26.000 --> 39:28.801
You covered it up.
You hid the body.

39:30.638 --> 39:32.772
Because I thought
I'd get in trouble.

39:32.807 --> 39:34.774
I have kids.

39:34.809 --> 39:37.777
I'm a good mom-- ask anybody.

39:37.812 --> 39:40.813
I was just thinking
about my kids.

39:41.716 --> 39:44.650
Oh, my God.

39:44.686 --> 39:46.852
(sobs)

39:49.557 --> 39:51.357
BRENNAN:
<i>Okay, Christine,</i>

39:51.392 --> 39:52.825
the tea is ready to be poured.

39:52.860 --> 39:54.293
BOOTH:
Look at this.

39:54.329 --> 39:57.797
And Daddy has an extra big
piece of cake for Buddy.

39:57.832 --> 39:59.432
Buddy isn't hungry.

39:59.467 --> 40:02.168
He just wants you
to read a special book.

40:02.203 --> 40:04.123
What am I gonna do with
all this cake that I got?

40:04.138 --> 40:05.438
It's gonna go
to waste now.

40:05.473 --> 40:06.739
Daddy...
Yeah?

40:06.774 --> 40:08.474
The cake isn't real.

40:08.509 --> 40:09.942
BRENNAN:
Yeah.

40:09.977 --> 40:12.211
The cake's not real, Daddy.
Right.

40:12.246 --> 40:13.779
That's my bad.
I'll, uh...

40:13.815 --> 40:16.782
I'll bring the cake
back up to Mom, okay?

40:16.818 --> 40:18.351
It's supposed to be imaginary.

40:18.386 --> 40:19.585
Right?

40:19.620 --> 40:21.454
So what charges
are being filed?

40:21.489 --> 40:23.489
Well, for the landlady,
most likely manslaughter.

40:23.524 --> 40:25.358
And, uh, for Alana,
Caroline's gonna strike

40:25.393 --> 40:27.727
a deal for probation
to protect the kids.

40:27.762 --> 40:29.195
That's good, right?

40:29.230 --> 40:30.696
Well, it's the best
of a bad situation.

40:30.732 --> 40:31.732
(knocking on door)

40:31.733 --> 40:33.132
I'll get it.
Okay.

40:33.167 --> 40:35.501
So, here we go.

40:35.536 --> 40:37.970
Did you, uh,
pick out a book

40:38.005 --> 40:39.238
that we're gonna
read Buddy?

40:39.273 --> 40:40.706
Not yet.

40:40.742 --> 40:43.509
He wants a love story.

40:43.544 --> 40:45.077
Love story.

40:45.113 --> 40:46.445
Angela, hi.

40:46.481 --> 40:48.714
Avalon, uh, this
is a surprise.

40:48.750 --> 40:50.216
Why are you here?

40:50.251 --> 40:51.684
Well, it's a long story,

40:51.719 --> 40:53.386
but most of it
you'll think is rubbish,

40:53.421 --> 40:55.521
so I'll just skip
to the happy ending.

40:55.556 --> 40:57.490
We brought you
a present.

40:57.525 --> 40:58.858
A birthday present.

40:58.893 --> 41:00.426
Well, it's neither
of our birthdays.

41:00.461 --> 41:01.961
No, it's for Sweets' birthday.

41:01.996 --> 41:03.476
Do you remember
the thing he would do?

41:03.498 --> 41:07.032
He would give out presents
on his birthday.

41:07.068 --> 41:08.901
He would say how grateful
he was to all of us

41:08.936 --> 41:11.036
for another good year.
AVALON: Apparently,

41:11.072 --> 41:13.139
he finished your present
just before he died

41:13.174 --> 41:14.673
and never told anyone.

41:14.709 --> 41:17.309
He was gonna give
it to you today.

41:17.345 --> 41:19.111
A thumb drive?
Yeah.

41:19.147 --> 41:21.013
And this is
what is on it.

41:21.048 --> 41:23.215
It's the book that he
wrote for the two of you.

41:23.251 --> 41:25.551
When he was examining our
partnership for the Bureau?

41:25.586 --> 41:26.852
MONTENEGRO:
Yeah.

41:26.888 --> 41:28.421
But he left out the psychology

41:28.456 --> 41:30.122
and the efficacy of
your partnerships

41:30.158 --> 41:31.857
and all that other
boring, technical stuff

41:31.893 --> 41:33.993
and turned it into
a love story.

41:35.963 --> 41:38.564
By someone who really,
really loved you a lot.

41:41.135 --> 41:42.601
<i>Parts of the Whole.</i>

41:42.637 --> 41:46.338
Is that the book
Buddy wants us to read?

41:46.374 --> 41:48.307
Who's Buddy?

41:48.342 --> 41:50.109
Buddy is Christine's
imaginary friend.

41:50.144 --> 41:51.644
Imaginary?

41:52.480 --> 41:54.513
Okay.

41:54.549 --> 41:57.082
Whatever makes you feel better.

41:59.353 --> 42:02.988
"Dedicated to Temperance Brennan
and Seeley Booth,

42:03.024 --> 42:04.824
"the people who taught me
that understanding,

42:04.859 --> 42:07.359
"compassion and love

42:07.395 --> 42:09.195
"are not just
notions in a book.

42:09.230 --> 42:11.831
My life means more
because I know you."

42:19.640 --> 42:22.274
Buddy says we can
have cake now, Daddy.

42:23.798 --> 42:25.884
Let's have cake.

42:25.885 --> 42:27.819
BRENNAN:
Who wants imaginary cake?

42:27.854 --> 42:29.814
I'll have a thin slice.
I'm on a diet. Oh, okay...
