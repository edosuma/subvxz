00:08.300 --> 00:10.500
My name is Melinda Gordon.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.800
I'm married...

00:11.900 --> 00:14.100
I live in a small town...

00:14.200 --> 00:16.000
I own an antique shop.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.100
I might be just like you...

00:18.200 --> 00:19.900
except that from the time
I was a little girl,

00:20.000 --> 00:22.400
I knew that I could
talk to the dead.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.600
It's all right, honey.

00:23.700 --> 00:26.900
"Earth-bound spirits,"
my grandmother called them.

00:27.007 --> 00:29.500
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

00:29.602 --> 00:33.300
and they come to me for help.

00:34.707 --> 00:36.705
In order to tell you my story,

00:36.801 --> 00:40.406
I have to tell you theirs.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

00:58.409 --> 00:59.502
Ok!

00:59.608 --> 01:00.903
- How you doing?
- Pretty good!

01:01.007 --> 01:03.301
All right! Everything's in.
Salad's almost done.

01:03.408 --> 01:04.303
How did this happen?

01:04.405 --> 01:06.102
You mean this insane mad dash
at the last minute?

01:06.207 --> 01:08.202
That's the problem with having
a dinner party on a week night.

01:08.305 --> 01:10.603
It is amazing how much work
really cuts into your day.

01:10.707 --> 01:13.800
But you know what, this kind of chaos
is exactly what Holly thrived on.

01:13.908 --> 01:16.302
Back in the day when you two
were a couple of single girls,

01:16.407 --> 01:17.801
raising hell and breaking
hearts in the city?

01:17.907 --> 01:21.601
All right, she was the one who played
the field, I was merely the spectator.

01:21.707 --> 01:23.302
It's gonna be great having
her live in Grandview.

01:23.407 --> 01:24.700
All right, are Scott and Holly
usually on time?

01:24.806 --> 01:27.803
Yeah, always on the dot. But maybe
pregnancy has slowed her down.

01:27.905 --> 01:30.103
You think pregnancy is gonna
slow you down?

01:30.206 --> 01:34.002
I don't think we're gonna
find out anytime soon.

01:34.108 --> 01:36.301
Well, I think it might make you
even more beautiful.

01:36.407 --> 01:39.600
- All right, nice try. Move on.
- I had to go there, ok?

01:39.708 --> 01:42.301
All right, everything's good.
I'm gonna go change.

01:42.406 --> 01:45.002
Candles are lit, table's ready.
I'm gonna get dressed, too.

01:45.108 --> 01:47.901
Want to race?

01:55.305 --> 01:58.702
What is wrong with you?!

02:09.907 --> 02:11.302
You thinking what I'm thinking?

02:11.408 --> 02:13.700
Yeah, they're gonna be
here in 15 minutes.

02:13.807 --> 02:17.500
Well, I thought you were
good at multitasking.

02:17.607 --> 02:18.603
Saved by the phone!

02:18.708 --> 02:19.603
Hello?

02:19.705 --> 02:21.100
Holly, hi!

02:21.207 --> 02:23.302
No. No, no, no.

02:23.406 --> 02:25.001
No, you just take your time.

02:25.106 --> 02:26.303
We'll be right here.

02:26.405 --> 02:28.903
Ok. Bye.

02:30.306 --> 02:32.001
Holly's running a little late.

02:32.107 --> 02:34.402
Scott's stuck at work.

02:34.508 --> 02:35.401
Bummer.

02:35.507 --> 02:36.200
Yeah.

02:36.306 --> 02:38.903
They could be at least half an hour.

02:39.006 --> 02:41.600
Damn them.

02:48.507 --> 02:50.301
Fantastic as usual, Jim.

02:50.408 --> 02:51.903
Thank you.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.901
Hey, you know, you should
take a plate home for Scott.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.903
He's probably already
eaten at the office.

02:56.006 --> 02:59.203
He's been working there
around the clock.

02:59.305 --> 03:01.002
What's the matter?

03:01.106 --> 03:05.201
The baby's been in a really
bad mood lately.

03:05.308 --> 03:08.000
What does an unborn baby have to
be in a bad mood about?

03:08.106 --> 03:11.201
Can't find the remote?

03:11.306 --> 03:14.102
I know, it's funny...

03:14.205 --> 03:17.602
but I really do feel like
I can tell his mood.

03:17.705 --> 03:21.802
Kid, when you get out in the real world,
then you'll know what a bad mood is.

03:21.907 --> 03:23.901
Do you hear how your
husband is abusing me?

03:24.007 --> 03:28.202
Yes, and I wouldn't
take it from him.

03:32.306 --> 03:35.101
Hey, have you guys worked on
picking a name yet?

03:35.205 --> 03:36.003
No!

03:36.106 --> 03:39.802
I want something simple but strong,
like David or Michael.

03:39.907 --> 03:44.701
But Scott keeps throwing around
these names - Hunter, Tag, Chase.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.701
It sounds like a game
of hide and seek.

03:46.806 --> 03:50.800
- Hey, do you need anything?
- No.

03:55.806 --> 03:58.003
Scott, you scared
the hell out of me.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.500
I'm sorry I'm so late.

03:59.608 --> 04:03.502
Come in.
It's time for dessert.

04:04.007 --> 04:07.902
Hey, you guys, look who I found.

04:09.106 --> 04:11.502
Holly?!

04:12.207 --> 04:14.902
Holly, are you ok?

04:15.006 --> 04:15.900
What's wrong?
What's wrong with her?

04:16.007 --> 04:17.402
She's having some kind of seizure.

04:17.505 --> 04:21.202
How can this be happening?
This is the beginning not the end.

04:21.305 --> 04:25.001
How could you do this to me?

04:26.606 --> 04:28.801
Mel?

04:34.706 --> 04:37.802
Melinda!
Call 911.

05:03.606 --> 05:07.003
EPISODE 2x13
"Deja Boo"

05:17.507 --> 05:19.903
Holly!

05:26.705 --> 05:28.202
Jim, he's in there.

05:28.308 --> 05:29.502
I have to get in there.

05:29.607 --> 05:35.902
It's all right. I cleared it with one
of the nurses. Just put these on.

06:05.806 --> 06:08.602
This is the end.
This can't continue.

06:08.705 --> 06:11.901
Not  ever again.
I'm the alpha and the omega.

06:12.008 --> 06:14.001
This is the end,
not the beginning.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.301
No!

06:20.308 --> 06:24.203
Jim, I just had the weirdest dream.

06:24.307 --> 06:29.103
Remind me to call the hospital
in the morning.

06:29.608 --> 06:30.502
Who are you?!

06:30.608 --> 06:34.801
- Eric Richard Johnny Oscar.
- Don't play games with me.

06:34.907 --> 06:35.802
Who are you?

06:35.907 --> 06:37.200
And what do you want
with Holly Newman?

06:37.306 --> 06:39.903
Why are you trying to hurt her?

06:40.008 --> 06:43.200
You're supposed to cross over.
Do you see a light?

06:43.307 --> 06:45.303
Do I see a light?

06:45.408 --> 06:49.301
Are you ok?
I heard you moving about.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.302
Yeah.

06:50.405 --> 06:53.700
- Why'd you get up?
- You kicked me in your sleep.

06:53.808 --> 06:57.401
Must have been some dream.

07:02.205 --> 07:03.601
So...

07:03.706 --> 07:05.201
what did the doctor say
about last night?

07:05.307 --> 07:09.000
Oh, it's a brand new one.
Preeclampsia.

07:09.108 --> 07:11.500
I told him it sounded
like a carpentry term.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.000
He didn't laugh. 

07:13.108 --> 07:15.601
- What does it mean?
- High blood pressure.

07:15.707 --> 07:19.002
Which would have lowered immediately if
he had just said "high blood pressure"

07:19.105 --> 07:20.801
instead of preeclampsia.

07:20.907 --> 07:22.800
Ok. Where's Scott?

07:22.905 --> 07:25.103
At work, as usual.

07:25.206 --> 07:29.503
Hey, do you remember
a guy named Oscar?

07:30.306 --> 07:32.002
Oscar...

07:32.108 --> 07:32.701
No.

07:32.805 --> 07:35.602
What about a Richard or Johnny?

07:35.707 --> 07:39.201
Wait,  this isn't about our trip to
Daytona over spring break, is it?

07:39.305 --> 07:41.003
Ew, and no.

07:41.105 --> 07:42.900
What about Eric?

07:43.108 --> 07:45.901
- Eric? No, but...
- What?

07:46.005 --> 07:48.702
I had a dream about somebody
named Eric last night,

07:48.805 --> 07:54.501
and  i woke up thinking that's
what I wanted to name the baby.

07:57.308 --> 07:59.102
Stop it!

07:59.208 --> 08:01.901
Are you ok?

08:02.005 --> 08:03.601
God, I feel like I just got stabbed.

08:03.706 --> 08:08.102
I'm gonna go see
if I can find a doctor.

08:11.607 --> 08:16.501
I guess you have to be 9
to figure this out, huh?

08:21.305 --> 08:23.400
Or just like really smart.

08:23.508 --> 08:26.302
- I've done it before.
- Ah, ringer.

08:26.405 --> 08:27.803
You look familiar to me.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.000
- Delia Banks.
- No, that's me.

08:30.108 --> 08:31.902
You, that's you.

08:32.006 --> 08:33.001
I'm Tim Flaherty.

08:33.107 --> 08:34.902
Oh, we met at the...

08:35.005 --> 08:37.801
- memorial.
- Right. For Eva Turner.

08:37.908 --> 08:40.301
Uh, I'm looking for a gift...

08:40.405 --> 08:41.602
uh, for my sister.

08:41.705 --> 08:44.203
Oh, well, does she like
russian nesting dolls?

08:44.307 --> 08:46.002
It's too complicated.

08:46.105 --> 08:49.300
Yeah, I was maybe looking for something, you know...

08:49.402 --> 08:50.600
pretty.

08:50.707 --> 08:54.705
You know, something like
a female would like.

08:54.801 --> 08:59.406
Let me see if we have anything in
this store that a female might like.

08:59.509 --> 09:03.101
Let's see. Come over here.

09:03.307 --> 09:06.703
I don't even know if the ghost
realizes that he's hurting Holly.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.301
I don't know why
he's obsessed with her.

09:08.407 --> 09:10.701
Holly used to be a poster child
for "girls gone wild."

09:10.807 --> 09:12.000
You don't think it's possible?

09:12.108 --> 09:14.601
Ok, I know what you're thinking,
and the answer is no.

09:14.707 --> 09:17.102
What if Holly had an affair
with the ghost?

09:17.206 --> 09:19.902
Well, don't you think she would
have at least told me about it?

09:20.007 --> 09:22.401
All right, then why is he
still hanging around her?

09:22.508 --> 09:24.200
I don't know.

09:24.308 --> 09:27.203
Where is this place?

09:27.306 --> 09:30.101
I have to go.

09:30.307 --> 09:31.703
Between the white one
and the green one.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.100
Vanilla Bean and Musty Cucumber.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.202
Musty cucumber?

09:36.307 --> 09:37.902
Why would anyone
want to smell that?

09:38.007 --> 09:39.500
You know...

09:39.605 --> 09:41.200
it's a female thing.

09:41.305 --> 09:43.103
Which one do you like?

09:43.207 --> 09:45.701
- Vanilla Bean.
- Sold.

09:45.808 --> 09:48.102
Ok, so we're closed.

09:48.208 --> 09:50.901
Oh, well, last sale
of the evening then.

09:51.008 --> 09:51.901
$15.

09:52.007 --> 09:53.601
That's quite the bean.

09:53.707 --> 09:57.203
You know what, Tim, I think they're
really gonna enjoy the new aroma
at the firehouse.

09:57.308 --> 09:59.002
Uh, it's for my sister.

09:59.106 --> 10:00.703
Ok then.

10:00.808 --> 10:05.003
You know what?
Maybe I'll see you...

10:06.607 --> 10:09.203
When you close, you really close.

10:09.306 --> 10:11.201
Yeah, you have to be firm,
or you never get home.

10:11.306 --> 10:13.803
Speaking of which...
good night.

10:13.906 --> 10:16.903
Oh, I'm in no rush. I thought
maybe we could do some invoicing.

10:17.005 --> 10:22.301
You know what, I just need
a few minutes of alone time.

10:26.707 --> 10:29.800
- You know...
- Good night.

10:29.906 --> 10:32.903
Good night then.

10:49.105 --> 10:51.402
We need to talk about
something really important.

10:51.506 --> 10:54.000
Are you the father of Holly's baby?

10:54.108 --> 10:55.700
I don't even know who she is.

10:55.807 --> 10:58.403
- Well, then why are you...
- Where are my t-shirts?

10:58.507 --> 10:59.703
What t-shirts?

10:59.806 --> 11:02.003
Ok, tell me your name.

11:02.108 --> 11:04.302
Eric Sanborn,
but this isn't my store.

11:04.407 --> 11:05.700
You have a store?

11:05.806 --> 11:08.800
Yeah, alt outside of Grandview.

11:08.907 --> 11:10.502
Alt...

11:10.608 --> 11:15.201
A-l-t. All-t. Alternative.
The alt button on your keyboard.

11:15.305 --> 11:16.803
It kind of means a lot of different things.

11:16.905 --> 11:19.902
That's what I like about it.

11:20.007 --> 11:22.300
Eric?

11:23.505 --> 11:25.803
Eric?

11:26.507 --> 11:27.701
No, ma'am.

11:27.805 --> 11:29.600
My name is John Richmond.

11:29.708 --> 11:31.500
Friends call me Johnny.

11:31.606 --> 11:33.801
You just said your name was Eric

11:33.907 --> 11:36.902
and that you own a t-shirt shop
outside of Grandview.

11:37.005 --> 11:38.601
I did?

11:38.708 --> 11:41.703
Sun's awful hot.
Must have been working.

11:41.808 --> 11:45.100
I'm a day-laborer. Old man Miller's farm.

11:45.206 --> 11:47.602
- Where's that?
- Near Tulsa.

11:47.707 --> 11:52.203
- What do you want?
- What does who want?

11:52.405 --> 11:53.703
Johnny.

11:53.805 --> 11:55.500
No, sorry. Oscar.

11:55.605 --> 11:57.502
So, I take it you're
not a day-laborer.

11:57.607 --> 11:59.303
Me? No.

11:59.408 --> 12:01.300
I'm a freshman.
I just started at state.

12:01.405 --> 12:02.601
Who are you really?

12:02.707 --> 12:05.903
You ask a lot of questions.

12:06.005 --> 12:07.200
Who are you?

12:07.308 --> 12:09.703
My name is Richard Ward.

12:09.808 --> 12:12.400
You can call me Richie.

12:12.508 --> 12:14.100
Look, I'm just trying to help you.

12:14.208 --> 12:18.100
- You can help me?
- Yes, I can.

12:18.308 --> 12:20.700
I just don't understand
what you want.

12:20.805 --> 12:24.101
Or who you really are.

12:26.507 --> 12:29.000
My name's Richard.

12:29.108 --> 12:30.801
My friends call me Johnny.

12:30.905 --> 12:32.602
Please.

12:32.706 --> 12:34.503
Oscar Hodges.
I'm a freshman.

12:34.605 --> 12:37.203
My name's Eric. I own a t-shirt
shop just outside of town.

12:37.306 --> 12:38.600
Please.

12:38.707 --> 12:39.900
Richard.

12:40.008 --> 12:41.001
Johnny.

12:41.107 --> 12:42.001
Oscar.

12:42.106 --> 12:42.603
Eric.

12:42.705 --> 12:44.400
Stop, you're making me sick.

12:44.508 --> 12:45.400
Summerville.

12:45.506 --> 12:46.201
Tulsa.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.600
Please!

12:47.705 --> 12:48.601
Chicago.

12:48.708 --> 12:49.600
Grandview.

12:49.705 --> 12:53.103
What are you looking at?

13:01.106 --> 13:04.401
You're making me sick.

13:09.107 --> 13:11.402
Can you help me?
You said you can help me.

13:11.506 --> 13:15.002
You said you can help me!

13:25.508 --> 13:28.503
Come on! This guy had multiple
personality disorder when he was alive,

13:28.608 --> 13:31.501
now he's dead. So, he's using
his alter egos to haunt you.

13:31.605 --> 13:32.800
That's it. Case closed.

13:32.906 --> 13:34.902
This ghost thing is easy
once you get the hang of it.

13:35.006 --> 13:36.802
I don't even know why you guys
make such a big deal out of it.

13:36.906 --> 13:39.302
You don't have the hang of anything,
at least not with this ghost.

13:39.407 --> 13:40.701
Look, when someone has
an affliction in their life,

13:40.805 --> 13:42.403
they're free of it when they die.

13:42.505 --> 13:43.602
The soul is pure and clear.

13:43.708 --> 13:47.000
Are you sure it's not
4 completely separate ghos?

13:47.107 --> 13:49.503
They all look exactly alike.

13:49.605 --> 13:50.400
I hate this!

13:50.506 --> 13:52.503
I want to see this!
This isn't fair!

13:52.605 --> 13:54.200
I should be able to see this!
I have a doctorate.

13:54.305 --> 13:56.400
- You don't have a doctorate.
- Be careful what you wish for.

13:56.506 --> 13:58.001
All right, I'm over it.
Listen, all right.

13:58.106 --> 14:00.401
Are one of these personalities
more dominant than the others?

14:00.505 --> 14:02.801
Yeah, I think at least the one
that I have the most information on.

14:02.907 --> 14:05.100
- Hey, are you online?
- Yes, but careful.

14:05.208 --> 14:07.100
Sometimes my modem and I
are not speaking.

14:07.208 --> 14:10.701
That's private. Don't pry.
Don't be a prier, a nosy parker.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.200
I won't.

14:12.305 --> 14:17.101
I found a web site,
it's about a store he owned.

14:17.207 --> 14:18.302
That's him.

14:18.406 --> 14:22.602
So this is what it's
like to see a ghost.

14:22.707 --> 14:25.200
Hey! This was not here yesterday. 

14:25.305 --> 14:27.801
It says, "Eric passed away. Please
don't post messages to him any more."

14:27.906 --> 14:28.901
"Brenda Sanborn."

14:29.008 --> 14:30.903
We've gotta get out of here.
We have to go now.

14:31.005 --> 14:34.001
We? Where?
To this Brenda person.

14:34.105 --> 14:36.103
- To the store.
- Aha! That's my next stop.

14:36.205 --> 14:37.500
They open at noon.

14:37.606 --> 14:38.503
Damn it.

14:38.608 --> 14:40.501
I have a class to teach.
Will you wait for me?

14:40.607 --> 14:43.502
You  know the old saying:
"she travels fastest who travels alone."

14:43.607 --> 14:46.103
It's Rudyard Kipling. I've read
all his books. And you know what?

14:46.205 --> 14:48.702
I think I'm a little tired of you
using me just for my brain.

14:48.808 --> 14:54.903
If only that were possible. But
so much of your mouth comes with it.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.103
Hi.

15:00.208 --> 15:04.100
I'm looking for Brenda Sanborn.

15:04.707 --> 15:07.502
I didn't know collection
agencies made house calls.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.103
Look, I told the first
chick who called

15:09.205 --> 15:10.500
I'm not gonna have a check
till at least...

15:10.607 --> 15:13.301
Ok,  I'm not from
a collection agency.

15:13.407 --> 15:14.702
I'm just a friend...

15:14.808 --> 15:17.903
or an acquaintance of Eric.

15:18.006 --> 15:19.400
I saw the web site.

15:19.505 --> 15:22.302
I'm sorry you had to
find out like that. I just...

15:22.407 --> 15:25.302
I didn't know how else
to get the word out.

15:25.408 --> 15:26.703
How did he die?

15:26.807 --> 15:28.302
An aneurysm.

15:28.408 --> 15:29.901
What did you say
your name was again?

15:30.007 --> 15:33.201
I'm sorry.
I'm Melinda.

15:33.308 --> 15:36.900
I own a store in Grandview.

15:38.108 --> 15:39.303
So, did Eric owe you money?

15:39.407 --> 15:42.402
- No. Did he owe a lot?
- Not any more.

15:42.506 --> 15:43.600
Now I owe it.

15:43.708 --> 15:45.900
That's what brothers are for, right?

15:46.005 --> 15:50.400
Eric never let a little thing like money
stop him from doing whatever he wanted.

15:50.508 --> 15:53.000
Did you know Holly Newman?

15:53.106 --> 15:55.602
I didn't know most
of Eric's girlfriends.

15:55.708 --> 15:57.401
Neither did he really.

15:57.505 --> 16:00.100
Well, what about any
of his other friends?

16:00.207 --> 16:01.200
Richard Ward,

16:01.308 --> 16:02.302
Oscar Hodges,

16:02.406 --> 16:03.200
John Richmond.

16:03.305 --> 16:07.000
More people he owed money to?

16:15.506 --> 16:17.802
Eric called these his collectibles. 

16:17.906 --> 16:20.200
I called them junk.

16:20.305 --> 16:21.702
What is all this?

16:21.807 --> 16:23.303
Oh, weather vanes,

16:23.405 --> 16:25.503
and plates and dishes,

16:25.608 --> 16:28.301
and clocks.

16:29.105 --> 16:31.701
- It looks like stuff I would sell.
- That was never for sale.

16:31.806 --> 16:34.300
Eric was obsessed with this crap.

16:34.405 --> 16:37.201
He'd  spend the weekends when he was
supposed to be working the register

16:37.308 --> 16:42.203
looking for this stuff at
garage sales, flea markets...

16:42.308 --> 16:44.401
- Do you know why?
- Just that he liked them.

16:44.505 --> 16:45.801
I never understood it.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.703
He spent a lot of money on it, too.

16:47.906 --> 16:52.003
I have no idea where
he got the cash.

16:52.407 --> 16:54.102
You think you could
sell any of this?

16:54.207 --> 16:56.301
Let me look into it.

16:56.407 --> 16:58.202
Do you think I could
take a couple pieces?

16:58.308 --> 17:02.602
Let me just throw
some things in a box.

17:08.107 --> 17:11.002
I've been going through this box
trying to find out something more
about Eric.

17:11.105 --> 17:15.002
Simple. He was a man obsessed
with time and eating.

17:15.107 --> 17:16.001
And the weather.

17:16.108 --> 17:18.902
And why is it that everyone else
is better at my job than me lately?

17:19.005 --> 17:21.202
Ho ho! Touchy.

17:21.307 --> 17:22.400
I started with the clocks.

17:22.506 --> 17:25.001
They're made at the same factory
at the same company in Massachusetts.

17:25.107 --> 17:27.702
The place is still there,
so I asked somebody to check
the payroll files for me.

17:27.805 --> 17:30.200
- And Eric worked there?
- No, but Richard Ward did,

17:30.308 --> 17:33.302
and one of his other personalities...
Oscar Hodges.

17:33.405 --> 17:34.703
- He worked there?
- No, he didn't.

17:34.808 --> 17:38.603
But there was a family named
Hodges who owned Aritmeza.

17:38.706 --> 17:40.301
- Aritmeza fine china.
- Absolutely.

17:40.406 --> 17:43.002
Then I went online and searched
the public records

17:43.106 --> 17:45.802
- for Eric's death certificate.
- Oh, I got it.

17:45.905 --> 17:47.800
- Eric's not dead.
- Eric is dead.

17:47.908 --> 17:50.602
And so are his other personalities,
Johnny, Richard, and Oscar.

17:50.708 --> 17:53.902
They all had death certificates
on file. They were real people.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.502
All right, so if Eric didn't make up
these ghosts' personalities,

17:56.605 --> 17:57.803
he based them on people he knew.

17:57.908 --> 17:59.902
There is no way he could have
known them. Listen to this:

18:00.005 --> 18:01.501
John Richmond died in 1945,

18:01.606 --> 18:03.402
Oscar Hodges - 1963,

18:03.505 --> 18:05.700
Richard Ward - 1983,

18:05.806 --> 18:07.903
a year before Eric was even born.

18:08.007 --> 18:09.001
A connection to Holly.

18:09.106 --> 18:11.102
Not that I can tell.

18:11.208 --> 18:13.201
I told his sister that
I'd buy the rest of his stuff

18:13.307 --> 18:16.203
and see if I could
find something else.

18:16.305 --> 18:20.203
Told you I could figure it out.

18:20.807 --> 18:23.301
I'm working.

18:23.407 --> 18:25.700
Look.

18:26.205 --> 18:29.200
Oh, it's perfect.

18:30.006 --> 18:32.603
Baby steps.

18:32.705 --> 18:34.803
- You really think he's interested?
- Yeah, definitely.

18:34.905 --> 18:38.403
He's if you can believe it,
just a little shy around women.

18:38.507 --> 18:41.302
Maybe we can help him along.

18:41.406 --> 18:44.400
Oh, there she is.

18:46.807 --> 18:47.802
Hi!

18:47.907 --> 18:48.600
Hey.

18:48.707 --> 18:51.203
You know what, it might be easier
to unload if you pull around back.

18:51.306 --> 18:55.802
Ok. Hey, before I forget, I found
these under one of the boxes.

18:55.906 --> 18:57.500
They're just some papers
and stuff of Eric's.

18:57.607 --> 18:59.001
I really didn't go through it.

18:59.106 --> 19:00.603
Why are you giving them to me?

19:00.705 --> 19:04.103
Well, I think they belong to those
friends of Eric's you told me about.

19:04.206 --> 19:06.003
I figured you'd be in touch with them.

19:06.106 --> 19:07.900
I'm sure I will be.

19:08.005 --> 19:11.502
I'll see you around back.

19:12.507 --> 19:16.202
Eric collected every official
document he could on Richard Ward,

19:16.308 --> 19:17.902
Oscar Hodges,

19:18.005 --> 19:20.201
and John Richmond.

19:20.307 --> 19:21.702
Did his sister know why?

19:21.806 --> 19:24.300
I get the feeling they weren't very
close, and I think I know why.

19:24.406 --> 19:26.001
He was ghosting them.

19:26.105 --> 19:26.702
Haunting them.

19:26.807 --> 19:28.401
No, I mean like identity theft.

19:28.508 --> 19:30.402
I think he was stealing
the identities of dead people

19:30.505 --> 19:33.001
so he could get credit cards,
loans, stuff in their names.

19:33.108 --> 19:35.501
That explains all your documents,
but what about the weather vanes,

19:35.607 --> 19:36.601
the dishes, all that stuff?

19:36.706 --> 19:39.702
I don't know. Maybe he was
obsessed with these people.

19:39.805 --> 19:42.203
And now his karmic reward is
to be saddled with their identities

19:42.307 --> 19:43.703
after death. That's perfect.

19:43.806 --> 19:45.600
Well, you know what
they say about payback.

19:45.706 --> 19:48.203
I mean, maybe this was his way
of dealing with his guild.

19:48.305 --> 19:51.101
Besides, ghosting can be a huge
deal for families of the dead.

19:51.206 --> 19:53.802
I mean, all of a sudden, your dearly
departed is shopping and racking up

19:53.906 --> 19:55.403
thousands of dollars in debt.

19:55.508 --> 19:58.103
You have to clear their name
and declare them dead again.

19:58.206 --> 20:00.300
I can see how that
would be stressful.

20:00.405 --> 20:01.802
How you gonna help him?

20:01.907 --> 20:05.600
Get him to remember it.
Face what he's done.

20:05.708 --> 20:08.001
Anyway, I'll be back
in an hour or so.

20:08.108 --> 20:09.801
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go to the store.

20:09.906 --> 20:13.902
All of his collectables are there.
Maybe he will be, too.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.200
Bye.

20:41.106 --> 20:42.800
Eric...

20:42.906 --> 20:48.400
I know you're here. Your energy
always makes me feel dizzy.

20:55.408 --> 20:56.903
What is it?

20:57.008 --> 21:00.200
I just hurt so much.

21:00.508 --> 21:02.700
Why?

21:05.306 --> 21:07.900
This just too much.

21:08.007 --> 21:09.802
What is?

21:09.906 --> 21:10.700
Everything.

21:10.807 --> 21:14.102
Eric, you have to try and remember
some things that happened,

21:14.207 --> 21:16.600
some things that happened to you
when you were alive.

21:16.706 --> 21:18.601
I remember too much!

21:18.706 --> 21:22.002
Don't you understand?

21:26.206 --> 21:27.401
Stop it!

21:27.508 --> 21:28.503
Shut up, shut up.

21:28.606 --> 21:31.100
Stop it!

21:34.307 --> 21:38.101
Eric, it's ok.
I can help you.

21:44.505 --> 21:48.402
Just tell me what you remember.

21:51.308 --> 21:53.002
Dying.

21:53.108 --> 21:57.400
- I know that's hard.
- I died 4 times.

21:59.207 --> 22:01.703
4 times.

22:32.705 --> 22:34.901
Did you just remember this?

22:35.006 --> 22:37.700
I knew it when I was alive...

22:37.806 --> 22:41.101
from when I was a kid.

22:41.306 --> 22:45.902
I remember things that
never happened to me.

22:48.108 --> 22:50.103
Just felt them.

22:50.208 --> 22:55.501
When you died the last time,
did you go into the light?

22:58.206 --> 23:00.201
I saw the light.
I wanted it so bad.

23:00.307 --> 23:02.801
- Yeah, but did you go into it?
- Yes.

23:02.906 --> 23:05.502
It felt so good.

23:05.607 --> 23:08.401
Then I saw it.

23:10.208 --> 23:15.700
Every bad thing I ever did,
every bad thing I ever let happen.

23:15.806 --> 23:17.402
Everyone I hurt.

23:17.507 --> 23:20.501
I hurt everyone.

23:21.607 --> 23:24.801
And then I wasn't
in the light any more.

23:24.908 --> 23:28.502
What's the first thing that you remember
when you came back from the light?

23:28.606 --> 23:30.101
I saw people I didn't know.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.400
That couple.

23:31.505 --> 23:33.802
I couldn't stop following them.

23:33.908 --> 23:35.702
And then you.

23:35.807 --> 23:38.502
You're the first person
that could see me.

23:38.606 --> 23:40.301
What about the others?

23:40.406 --> 23:44.003
The other spirits with you?

23:45.306 --> 23:48.103
I'm so tired.

23:52.907 --> 23:54.000
Reincarnation?!

23:54.106 --> 23:54.700
It has to be!

23:54.805 --> 23:57.401
It explains the memories,
the other personalities.

23:57.507 --> 24:00.200
He remembers going into the light
and seeing his life review.

24:00.307 --> 24:02.500
How did this happen?
How did you get ahead of me?!

24:02.607 --> 24:03.802
You'll get the hang of it.

24:03.906 --> 24:05.602
I thought you only deal
with earthbound spirits,

24:05.706 --> 24:08.402
that once they cross over,
they're no longer on your radar.

24:08.506 --> 24:09.702
True, but he came back.

24:09.806 --> 24:14.101
Well, then how do you explain you saw
the ghost of Ricky, Fernando, and Jorge?

24:14.208 --> 24:15.703
You mean Johnny, Richard, and Oscar?

24:15.807 --> 24:18.702
Exactly. If they were reincarnated,
then they would have already crossed over.

24:18.807 --> 24:21.601
Can you explain why
or how you saw them?

24:21.706 --> 24:23.202
No.

24:23.306 --> 24:24.303
Good! Good!

24:24.406 --> 24:25.902
'Cause that means I'm ahead again!

24:26.005 --> 24:27.500
You didn't see the ghosts
of those 3 guys.

24:27.606 --> 24:31.203
What you saw was soul fragmentation,
or soul residue if you will,

24:31.306 --> 24:34.601
and I hope that you will,
of Eric's prior incarnations.

24:34.706 --> 24:35.702
Why?

24:35.805 --> 24:38.200
Why? The guy had a lot of problems.

24:38.307 --> 24:41.602
And he was holding onto a lot
of troublesome life experiences.

24:41.708 --> 24:43.501
It's like when you turn off
a plasma television

24:43.605 --> 24:45.502
and the image stays there a while.

24:45.607 --> 24:47.802
Ok, this is actually
making my teeth hurt.

24:47.905 --> 24:50.301
I've never dealt with
a reincarnated soul before.

24:50.407 --> 24:53.001
Well, half the world's
cultures and religions

24:53.107 --> 24:56.003
would actually disagree with you.
There's the Hindus, the Buddhists,

24:56.106 --> 24:59.802
the Chinese, the native Americans,
Shirley Maclaine, all the tops.

24:59.908 --> 25:01.203
They believe we come back.

25:01.306 --> 25:02.702
Every soul or just some?

25:02.806 --> 25:05.700
Depends on what life lesson
is still needed to be learned.

25:05.808 --> 25:09.000
But all cultures pretty much
have the same take on that theme.

25:09.107 --> 25:11.302
That you keep coming back
until you get it right.

25:11.407 --> 25:14.603
This soul remembers everything.
It's like it's torturing him.

25:14.706 --> 25:15.902
It's like he doesn't
want to come back.

25:16.007 --> 25:20.602
Souls are assigned.
There's no trial period here.

25:20.705 --> 25:22.700
What?

25:22.805 --> 25:24.602
My friend Holly is pregnant.

25:24.706 --> 25:27.602
Eric's been haunting her.

25:27.707 --> 25:30.803
You think that Eric's been assigned
to be born to Holly?

25:30.908 --> 25:32.701
Why else would he
be attached to her?

25:32.808 --> 25:33.902
Holly would know.

25:34.008 --> 25:34.902
How?

25:35.008 --> 25:36.800
When a soul is ready
to be reincarnated,

25:36.907 --> 25:40.801
it lets its mother
know through a dream.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.700
It's called an announcing dream.

25:42.805 --> 25:44.502
She had that dream.

25:44.607 --> 25:48.003
Eric came to her. That's how
she picked out the baby's name.

25:48.107 --> 25:53.000
And he's trying to stop
the baby from being born.

25:53.406 --> 25:55.401
That sounds...

25:55.505 --> 25:57.901
crazy.

25:58.207 --> 26:00.200
Eric, you're dead...

26:00.307 --> 26:03.501
and yet you're standing
here talking to me?

26:03.606 --> 26:06.600
Let's get a grip on
what's crazy and what isn't.

26:06.707 --> 26:08.901
So, all these things I remember,

26:09.008 --> 26:11.601
all these memories, I actually...

26:11.708 --> 26:13.502
I actually lived those lives?

26:13.607 --> 26:15.603
Yeah, I think so.

26:15.705 --> 26:21.503
And I'm still here because I have to
come back and do it again.

26:21.606 --> 26:23.402
I don't want to do that.

26:23.506 --> 26:24.902
I don't think it's your choice.

26:25.005 --> 26:27.300
You don't know what it's like
to remember so much,

26:27.408 --> 26:31.100
to feel it over and over again.

26:31.206 --> 26:34.103
You learn to love your life
and the people in it.

26:34.205 --> 26:36.501
And then you lose them.

26:36.607 --> 26:39.603
I've seen my parents die...

26:39.706 --> 26:41.402
3 times.

26:41.508 --> 26:46.303
The time before last,
I lost my little brother.

26:46.808 --> 26:50.302
The friends, the people
you care about...

26:50.408 --> 26:51.801
they just drift away.

26:51.907 --> 26:54.000
You lose them all.

26:54.108 --> 26:55.701
I'm tired.

26:55.807 --> 26:58.502
I can't take another lifetime.

26:58.608 --> 27:00.501
Ok, well, maybe you won't
remember next time.

27:00.606 --> 27:03.503
- Maybe you can start fresh.
- And what's the point?

27:03.605 --> 27:09.101
Why do I have to come back again?
What do I have to learn?

27:13.708 --> 27:18.803
I'm supposed to come back
to your friend, aren't I?

27:23.008 --> 27:26.002
I'm not coming back.

27:26.105 --> 27:27.801
Eric, you can't do that.

27:27.906 --> 27:30.700
I don't care what I have to do...

27:30.806 --> 27:34.401
or who I have to do it to.

27:35.307 --> 27:38.103
I'm finished.

27:44.106 --> 27:46.602
And there's nothing we can do
to protect Holly and her baby?

27:46.708 --> 27:50.201
He's very powerful.
He made her sick, he made me sick.

27:50.305 --> 27:52.603
Hey, two tickets for tomorrow night.
Name's Clancy.

27:52.706 --> 27:55.103
Thanks.

27:56.107 --> 27:57.601
Oh, that's perfect.

27:57.707 --> 27:59.500
Hi, guys.

27:59.608 --> 28:01.602
Oh. Hey.

28:01.708 --> 28:03.401
Oh, it's so nice to see you guys.

28:03.507 --> 28:06.400
I know, it's actually
perfect timing.

28:06.507 --> 28:06.900
What do you mean?

28:07.008 --> 28:09.802
Well, we had tickets to see
this show tomorrow night.

28:09.908 --> 28:11.500
- And we can't go.
- Nope.

28:11.606 --> 28:13.200
We think you should go.

28:13.305 --> 28:16.303
Yeah, hate to see them go to waste.

28:16.405 --> 28:17.602
- I...
- Fantastic.

28:17.705 --> 28:20.000
You know, have a good time, and we
expect a report when you get back.

28:20.107 --> 28:22.601
Good night.

28:22.708 --> 28:26.000
Which one do you think is a brighter
shade of red, him or her?

28:26.105 --> 28:28.600
This has gotta be him.
He's gonna kill me.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.201
Listen, dude, you got...

28:31.308 --> 28:34.001
Holly, no, shh!
Calm down, calm...

28:34.106 --> 28:35.903
Fine, we'll be at the hospital
as soon as we can.

28:36.005 --> 28:38.703
It's Holly.

28:43.408 --> 28:45.300
- Scott!
- She's still not stabile.

28:45.406 --> 28:46.901
They don't know why.

28:47.006 --> 28:49.601
- She's starting labor.
- Ok, I have to get in there.

28:49.708 --> 28:50.801
I can help her through this.

28:50.908 --> 28:53.103
Ok.

28:55.607 --> 28:58.101
I don't understand this.
Her blood pressure is still spiking.

28:58.207 --> 28:59.300
That's it, Holly.

28:59.406 --> 29:01.202
You just keep breathing.

29:01.305 --> 29:02.101
You're going good!

29:02.207 --> 29:04.100
What the hell?! I'm sorry,
I have to ask you to leave.

29:04.208 --> 29:05.802
I need this room cleared
of all visitors!

29:05.906 --> 29:07.503
No, I can help her!

29:07.606 --> 29:09.801
Please! And I'm telling you
you have to leave now!

29:09.906 --> 29:13.303
You, too, Scott! Please!

29:14.007 --> 29:16.703
The baby is deceling.
Get pediatrics down here stat!

29:16.805 --> 29:19.501
Right away.

29:31.607 --> 29:34.302
What is it?

29:35.608 --> 29:37.903
What?

29:43.807 --> 29:47.101
You have a baby girl.

29:55.308 --> 29:59.200
I had no idea 7 pounds
weighed so much.

29:59.305 --> 30:00.600
She's heavy.

30:00.708 --> 30:02.600
Well, don't tire yourself out, honey.

30:02.707 --> 30:04.500
Here, let me take her.

30:04.606 --> 30:06.201
Do you want me to
put her down for you?

30:06.307 --> 30:09.003
Sure. Yeah.

30:09.205 --> 30:11.400
Well, it looks like
we're gonna go with Erica.

30:11.505 --> 30:14.402
That's perfect.

30:16.506 --> 30:20.003
Thank you for being born.

30:21.707 --> 30:23.402
I'm still here.

30:23.508 --> 30:26.101
Why am I still here?

30:26.205 --> 30:29.002
Uh, hey, Jim?

30:29.408 --> 30:31.202
You know, I feel...
feel dizzy.

30:31.306 --> 30:34.701
Could you just hold her?

30:41.807 --> 30:46.103
- Are you all right?
- He's still here.

31:03.205 --> 31:05.402
Hey, are you feeling all right?

31:05.506 --> 31:07.603
I didn't sleep very well last night.

31:07.707 --> 31:10.800
Whoa! Look at you.

31:11.508 --> 31:14.803
Oh, that's right.
Tonight is your date with Tim.

31:14.906 --> 31:19.500
Yeah, I'm finally doing something with
a guy who isn't my 13-year-old son.

31:19.606 --> 31:21.903
Well, you look really beautiful.

31:22.007 --> 31:23.003
Thanks.

31:23.105 --> 31:24.602
I'm not going.

31:24.706 --> 31:26.100
What? Why?

31:26.206 --> 31:29.002
I can't find the right jewelry.

31:29.105 --> 31:31.903
And I have, uh...

31:32.006 --> 31:33.702
this feeling in the pit of my stomach.

31:33.807 --> 31:35.602
Yeah. Those are butterflies.

31:35.707 --> 31:38.102
No. It feels more like dread.

31:38.205 --> 31:41.803
Why? Tim seems like such a great guy.

31:41.906 --> 31:43.301
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

31:43.405 --> 31:48.101
You would be surprised
at my crazy threshold.

31:49.206 --> 31:51.601
I just feel like
I'm cheating on Charlie.

31:51.705 --> 31:54.801
One date does not mean
that you love Charlie any less.

31:54.905 --> 31:58.402
It's just I... I don't know.

31:58.506 --> 32:02.100
Maybe it's because I'm afraid I'm gonna
start to forget him or something.

32:02.207 --> 32:04.000
I know, see? I'm crazy.

32:04.108 --> 32:07.301
You will always love Charlie, always.

32:07.406 --> 32:11.301
And letting go and forgetting
are two completely different things.

32:11.408 --> 32:13.102
I don't know why
this is so hard on me.

32:13.207 --> 32:18.001
Well, you owe it to yourself to go
and have some fun. Talk, laugh.

32:18.106 --> 32:20.901
Wouldn't Charlie want that?

32:21.005 --> 32:25.202
Hey, you really are sick, aren't you?
I thought you got rid of that bug.

32:25.308 --> 32:28.001
Oh, I've been trying.
Don't worry, it's not contagious.

32:28.105 --> 32:30.203
You know what?
I have just the thing.

32:30.307 --> 32:32.101
I am gonna write down
the ingredients of this broth

32:32.207 --> 32:34.700
that will make you feel 100% better.

32:34.808 --> 32:40.803
I used it when I had morning sickness
when I was pregnant with Ned.

32:51.308 --> 32:53.500
No!

33:02.108 --> 33:05.203
What? I figured out
why Eric's still here.

33:05.305 --> 33:08.800
Why? He's still gonna be reincarnated
as somebody else's baby.

33:08.908 --> 33:10.602
Whose?

33:10.705 --> 33:13.002
Ours.

33:24.707 --> 33:27.501
Well, if you'd told me this last week,
that you thought you were pregnant,

33:27.605 --> 33:29.501
I would be walking on air.

33:29.607 --> 33:32.903
Before I knew about Eric.

33:33.005 --> 33:35.600
What if it was Eric's soul
and we just didn't know?

33:35.707 --> 33:37.803
Well, then we wouldn't know.

33:37.906 --> 33:38.902
Now we do.

33:39.008 --> 33:41.403
Look, if this happens,

33:41.505 --> 33:43.901
if it's real, will you be ok?

33:44.007 --> 33:45.600
Now, you know I want
to have a child with you.

33:45.707 --> 33:48.002
I mean, look, this is not what
I imagined or how I imagined...

33:48.106 --> 33:51.100
The way that this baby is
coming to us, is it gonna...

33:51.206 --> 33:53.000
change things?

33:53.107 --> 33:54.500
Change how you feel?

33:54.607 --> 33:56.300
Well, you're not seriously asking me
if it's gonna change the way

33:56.407 --> 33:58.101
I feel about you, are you?

33:58.206 --> 33:59.900
I really need to know.

34:00.005 --> 34:02.601
Ok. Hey...

34:04.107 --> 34:06.703
If this child is coming to us,
however it comes,

34:06.806 --> 34:11.199
it's still our kid made by us,
made by us, part of us.

34:11.306 --> 34:15.601
Maybe we're supposed to
teach him something or her.

34:15.706 --> 34:20.603
Things because of what you know,
only you and i could do.

34:20.705 --> 34:22.601
Mel, I'm there.

34:22.706 --> 34:25.502
I'm so there.

34:26.605 --> 34:29.701
But what about you?

34:31.505 --> 34:34.101
Look, I know you don't think you're
ready to have a child. I know that.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.100
I know it's huge.
I get it.

34:36.205 --> 34:41.000
And I will wait as long as you want
to wait, but if this baby is coming,

34:41.107 --> 34:44.701
are you gonna be all right?

34:48.806 --> 34:50.699
Are you gonna be there with me?

34:50.806 --> 34:52.402
'Cause I can't lose you.

34:52.505 --> 34:55.501
I can't lose what we have.

34:55.606 --> 34:58.302
Me neither.

35:00.205 --> 35:01.602
Promise?

35:01.708 --> 35:04.302
All right.

35:07.208 --> 35:10.100
More hot water?

35:16.406 --> 35:19.902
I mean, this is a soul that
doesn't want to come back. So...

35:20.008 --> 35:22.202
what if he tries to hurt you?

35:22.306 --> 35:25.200
I just need to talk to his sister.

35:25.305 --> 35:27.702
Explain it all to her and...

35:27.805 --> 35:30.900
maybe if she can be there
for him once he's reborn,

35:31.008 --> 35:33.402
he'll feel better
about coming back.

35:33.508 --> 35:36.101
All right.

36:25.506 --> 36:29.602
Look, I'm not saying I believe
any of this for a second,

36:29.708 --> 36:32.100
but if you're asking me
if I will be there for Eric

36:32.206 --> 36:35.001
when he comes back,
I can't do that.

36:35.108 --> 36:36.101
I can't.

36:36.207 --> 36:37.403
Why?

36:37.506 --> 36:40.603
Eric didn't really know who
I was to him when he was alive.

36:40.707 --> 36:43.200
He could care less
that I was there last time.

36:43.307 --> 36:46.503
He's not gonna care
if I'm there this time.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.600
I'm not taking care of him again.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.401
- Well, you don't have to...
- Oh, believe me, I would.

36:51.505 --> 36:53.302
It's what he does.

36:53.406 --> 36:54.500
Did.

36:54.608 --> 36:56.900
He gets people to take care of him,

36:57.005 --> 37:00.601
but he never returns the favor.

37:00.707 --> 37:03.300
You know, uh, maybe we should
talk again some other time.

37:03.407 --> 37:06.402
You know, my brother was
a selfish bastard.

37:06.506 --> 37:08.102
I gave up everything for him.

37:08.207 --> 37:10.702
My mom died, I raised him.

37:10.807 --> 37:15.600
My dad died, I skipped college so he
wouldn't have to go into foster care.

37:15.705 --> 37:19.403
This store, this is his dream,
not mine.

37:19.505 --> 37:22.401
But I put everything I had
into it to make it work,

37:22.508 --> 37:25.603
and he could care less.

37:25.705 --> 37:26.601
That's who he was.

37:26.707 --> 37:30.400
So why do you keep doing it?

37:31.706 --> 37:34.200
Because he was my brother.

37:34.306 --> 37:37.400
And because he had something.

37:37.507 --> 37:40.202
I don't know, when you
were in his good graces,

37:40.305 --> 37:43.403
you felt like you were really...

37:43.505 --> 37:46.100
really special.

37:46.205 --> 37:48.400
You know, I kept thinking that, um...

37:48.506 --> 37:54.903
if he could see how much I loved him
that maybe one day he would love me back.

37:55.006 --> 37:58.500
I mean, we're all the family we have.

37:58.607 --> 38:02.600
But then he just goes
and dies on me.

38:02.708 --> 38:08.302
I just wanted to know that
I counted for something with him.

38:08.508 --> 38:12.502
But he took that with him
when he died.

38:12.607 --> 38:14.401
So no,

38:14.505 --> 38:18.301
no, I am not gonna be there for Eric

38:18.406 --> 38:23.001
or whoever the hell he's gonna be
when he comes back.

38:23.108 --> 38:25.402
Well, I'm really sorry to hear that.

38:25.506 --> 38:28.003
Me, too.

38:38.805 --> 38:41.002
So it's you.

38:41.105 --> 38:44.102
I'm coming back to you.

38:44.208 --> 38:48.203
Don't fight it, Eric.
Just don't.

38:48.507 --> 38:51.300
But I heard Jim say
you didn't want a child.

38:51.406 --> 38:52.203
Not yet.

38:52.305 --> 38:54.002
I didn't think I was ready,

38:54.106 --> 38:59.801
but if this is what's supposed
to happen, then I'll get ready.

39:01.507 --> 39:05.001
How can you be like that?

39:10.208 --> 39:11.501
Like what?

39:11.605 --> 39:13.901
So generous with yourself.

39:14.005 --> 39:17.100
Look, I know how important
it is for you to move on.

39:17.207 --> 39:20.001
To not have to live
another life, so...

39:20.107 --> 39:23.700
Jim and I are going to do
the right thing by you, Eric.

39:23.805 --> 39:27.000
I heard everything you and Jim
said last night.

39:27.105 --> 39:28.603
So?

39:28.706 --> 39:34.300
I haven't had a conversation
like that in any of my lifetimes.

39:34.405 --> 39:38.402
I've never listened to anyone the way
you guys listen to each other.

39:38.508 --> 39:42.702
I've never cared what anyone wanted.

39:43.007 --> 39:47.600
I saw how much you wanted
to have that kid,

39:48.008 --> 39:51.903
and I saw how scared
you were by him.

39:52.008 --> 39:56.502
But you're willing to do it
not for you...

39:57.807 --> 39:59.501
for me.

39:59.606 --> 40:01.601
So I'm not gonna fight it.

40:01.705 --> 40:06.302
I'm not gonna do anything
to get in the way.

40:07.508 --> 40:10.902
I'll come back again...

40:11.307 --> 40:14.701
and I'll do it for you.

40:17.208 --> 40:19.700
Maybe I'll get it right this time

40:19.807 --> 40:21.101
and you'll help me.

40:21.206 --> 40:24.102
We'll help you, Eric.

40:24.208 --> 40:27.001
We both will.

40:28.707 --> 40:33.902
I don't know if you're gonna remember
any of this when you're born, but...

40:34.005 --> 40:38.403
we're gonna take
really good care of you.

40:38.508 --> 40:40.403
And we'll teach you
the best that we can,

40:40.506 --> 40:45.900
and we'll try to make sure
that this is your last time around.

40:46.007 --> 40:49.003
I know you will.

40:52.308 --> 40:54.802
I see it.

40:55.506 --> 40:58.001
I see the light.

40:58.108 --> 41:00.503
You've seen it before.

41:00.608 --> 41:02.701
Not as beautiful.

41:02.807 --> 41:05.301
I feel like it wants me to come.

41:05.407 --> 41:07.502
I don't understand.

41:07.605 --> 41:12.300
I don't feel like
anything's holding me back.

41:12.508 --> 41:14.001
What does that mean?

41:14.107 --> 41:17.102
I see my father.

41:19.408 --> 41:21.503
I see my dad.

41:21.607 --> 41:24.700
I see all my dads.

41:25.706 --> 41:29.001
They want me to come.

41:31.006 --> 41:34.302
They want me to come.

41:40.008 --> 41:42.800
But I'll stay.

41:43.805 --> 41:47.700
I'll go through another life...

41:48.505 --> 41:51.000
for you.

41:51.505 --> 41:55.700
If that's what you want,
I'll do that.

41:55.806 --> 41:58.200
I know.

42:00.905 --> 42:04.202
That's why you can go.

42:05.805 --> 42:08.302
You sure?

42:09.306 --> 42:14.302
There's just one more thing
you have to do for me.

42:25.007 --> 42:27.303
Eric?

42:30.105 --> 42:31.901
He's here.

42:32.006 --> 42:34.401
He's right beside you.

42:34.505 --> 42:38.503
He has his hand on your shoulder.

42:41.105 --> 42:43.700
He wants to tell you everything...

42:43.807 --> 42:47.102
that you meant to him.

43:29.505 --> 43:32.303
It's negative.

43:32.505 --> 43:37.200
Who knows if I was even pregnant
in the first place.

43:37.305 --> 43:40.202
I'm not sure how I feel.

43:40.307 --> 43:43.003
Me neither.

43:44.905 --> 43:46.601
I do know one thing.

43:46.708 --> 43:48.101
What?

43:48.207 --> 43:50.800
I'm ready.

43:51.106 --> 43:53.100
No matter what's ahead for us,

43:53.206 --> 43:56.501
I'm ready to go down
any road with you...

43:56.607 --> 43:59.201
go through any door.

43:59.306 --> 44:00.800
I know that now

44:00.906 --> 44:04.200
more than I ever did.

44:04.707 --> 44:07.803
That's all I need.
