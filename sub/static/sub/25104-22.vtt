00:04.634 --> 00:06.680
Welcome to the grand finale

00:06.723 --> 00:08.769
of the world's biggest
cooking competition.

00:08.812 --> 00:11.902
This season for the first time
ever in "MasterChef" history,

00:11.946 --> 00:13.600
we are battling each other

00:13.643 --> 00:16.559
to find the greatest
home cook in America.

00:16.603 --> 00:18.822
And now it's down
to just three.

00:18.866 --> 00:22.217
Buckle up.
It's starting right now.

00:22.260 --> 00:24.785
[ cheers and applause ]

00:25.873 --> 00:27.570
All:
MasterChef! MasterChef!

00:27.614 --> 00:29.224
Gordon:
The search for
the next MasterChef

00:29.267 --> 00:31.748
started with thousands
of hopeful home cooks

00:31.792 --> 00:34.011
from all across the country.

00:34.055 --> 00:36.840
Each judge had just
eight aprons

00:36.884 --> 00:39.713
to hand out
to the hopeful home cooks.

00:39.756 --> 00:41.410
Boy, do I see potential.

00:41.453 --> 00:43.804
And we each battled it out
to have the opportunity

00:43.847 --> 00:46.763
to mentor
the best of the best.

00:46.807 --> 00:48.156
When you have
talent like this,

00:48.199 --> 00:49.592
you can't let it
walk out the door.

00:49.636 --> 00:51.202
- Once one of our white aprons
- Yes!

00:51.246 --> 00:52.682
- was in their hands...
- Let's go!

00:52.726 --> 00:54.292
...the home cooks began

00:54.336 --> 00:55.946
the journey of a lifetime.

00:55.990 --> 00:58.427
- [ cheering ]
- Ashley: This is so beautiful.

00:58.470 --> 01:01.996
This season, the challenges
were more difficult
than ever before.

01:02.039 --> 01:04.651
- Judges: Switch!
- The contestants survived

01:04.694 --> 01:06.261
intense MasterChef
team challenges.

01:06.304 --> 01:07.610
- Ashley: Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

01:07.654 --> 01:09.046
Ashley:
They're landing for dinner.

01:09.090 --> 01:11.092
As the competition got
tougher...

01:11.135 --> 01:13.703
- I got tables
that are ready to walk out.
- I need the food!

01:13.747 --> 01:17.315
...we sometimes had to send home
our own home cooks.

01:17.359 --> 01:19.753
I gave you both aprons because
I believed in both of you.

01:19.796 --> 01:22.059
Please, place your apron
on your bench.

01:22.103 --> 01:24.714
Now only three
home cooks remain

01:24.758 --> 01:27.064
and each judge
finds themselves

01:27.108 --> 01:29.327
with one home cook
in the finale.

01:29.371 --> 01:31.895
So, the stakes
are just as high for us,

01:31.939 --> 01:34.550
because only one home cook

01:34.594 --> 01:37.118
will become
America's MasterChef.

01:37.161 --> 01:41.688
[ cheers, applause ]

01:41.731 --> 01:43.820
Now, last week
the contestants were sent home

01:43.864 --> 01:45.517
to prepare for the finale,

01:45.561 --> 01:48.564
and we went to surprise them
in their hometowns

01:48.608 --> 01:50.827
to make sure
that they were on track

01:50.871 --> 01:52.873
to take home the trophy.

01:52.916 --> 01:57.355

01:57.399 --> 01:59.227
- Aarón: Hello?
- Hello.

01:59.270 --> 02:01.446
- Joe: Hey. Hey, Gordon.
- Are you both there?

02:01.490 --> 02:04.798
Joe:
I'm just rolling through
downtown Nashville.

02:04.841 --> 02:06.800
- What's happening with you all?
- Aarón: Hey, Joe.

02:06.843 --> 02:08.671
How's Music City, my friend?

02:08.715 --> 02:10.760
What's that noise
in the background?
Where are you?

02:10.804 --> 02:13.502
- [ horns honking ]
- Yeah, I'm kind of in

02:13.545 --> 02:16.723
the swanky downtown part
of Houston.

02:16.766 --> 02:18.028
- I think you're lost.
- No, no, no.

02:18.072 --> 02:20.335
I should be
at Cesar's house shortly.

02:20.378 --> 02:21.858
This is why
we never let you drive.

02:21.902 --> 02:23.904
Because you're always
getting lost.

02:23.947 --> 02:26.950
Aarón, pull it together
and get to where you're going.

02:26.994 --> 02:30.345
Looks like I'm here, guys.
About to visit America's
next MasterChef.

02:30.388 --> 02:32.956
Joe:
Talk to you later. Bye.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.523
Are you guys still there?

02:34.566 --> 02:36.351
- [ line beeping ]
- Hello? Hello?

02:40.398 --> 02:41.704
[ doorbell chimes ]

02:43.793 --> 02:45.708
- Hello!
- Oh, my God. What--

02:45.752 --> 02:47.754
This is unreal.

02:47.797 --> 02:48.929
Hi, Mum. Hi, Dad.

02:48.972 --> 02:52.367
[ screaming ]

02:52.410 --> 02:55.196
I had to move back home
after I left

02:55.239 --> 02:56.806
my career as a teacher.

02:56.850 --> 02:58.721
Oh, my God!

02:58.765 --> 03:00.941
I mean, it's embarrassing
living with my parents

03:00.984 --> 03:02.943
- at 28 years old...
- Sit down.

03:02.986 --> 03:05.336
...but I have to do
whatever it takes

03:05.380 --> 03:07.817
to pursue
this culinary dream.

03:07.861 --> 03:09.732
Here we are.

03:09.776 --> 03:11.995
- The young lady
is back at home...
- Ashley: Back home.

03:12.039 --> 03:14.650
...because she wants to follow
this food dream.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.392
When she called me and said
she was gonna quit her job

03:17.435 --> 03:20.090
to be a chef,
I was like, "What?"

03:20.134 --> 03:22.005
- [ laughs ]
- I was nuts!

03:22.049 --> 03:24.747
When Ashley started
actually cooking here...

03:24.791 --> 03:26.836
- Yes.
- ...we doubted it.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.795
For a while,
we got a little nervous.

03:28.838 --> 03:31.232
[ laughing ]

03:31.275 --> 03:32.755
But we made sure
she had everything she needed.

03:32.799 --> 03:35.410
Trust me, food is
definitely her calling.

03:35.453 --> 03:38.021
If she wins,

03:38.065 --> 03:40.807
it's gonna be one
of my proudest moments ever.

03:40.850 --> 03:43.984
Ashley:
I want this for myself,
but I want this for them.

03:44.027 --> 03:47.030
They have literally--

03:47.074 --> 03:48.902
Damn.

03:52.035 --> 03:53.776
[ crying ] Even though
they didn't agree with me,

03:53.820 --> 03:56.692
they have never turned
their back on me.

03:56.736 --> 03:57.954
So how do you repay them?

03:57.998 --> 04:00.261
I don't know.
You know, just like every--

04:00.304 --> 04:02.611
You become America's
next MasterChef.

04:02.654 --> 04:04.047
- [ laughing ]
- Yes!

04:04.091 --> 04:05.614
Absolutely.

04:05.657 --> 04:09.226
Seeing Gordon is just
invigorating...

04:09.270 --> 04:10.924
Seat belts on, please.

04:10.967 --> 04:12.360
...because I get
to share with him

04:12.403 --> 04:15.015
who I am
and where I come from.

04:15.058 --> 04:17.844
It's very important for Gordon
to understand how I operate

04:17.887 --> 04:20.020
and why I operate
the way I do.

04:20.063 --> 04:22.065
I have not come
all the way to Opa-Locka

04:22.109 --> 04:24.067
without going
to the farmer's market.

04:24.111 --> 04:27.070
- See?
- Oh, my goodness.

04:27.114 --> 04:28.855
Getting to show him
all of the exotic fruit

04:28.898 --> 04:30.726
that I've grown up with,

04:30.770 --> 04:33.947
I couldn't have asked
for a better moment.

04:33.990 --> 04:35.992
- So this is where you shop.
- This is where I shop.

04:36.036 --> 04:38.473
- What an oasis!
- I know!

04:38.516 --> 04:40.083
- Give me a little insight...
- Yes.

04:40.127 --> 04:41.955
- ...just a little snippet
of the menu.
- Yes.

04:41.998 --> 04:43.217
- Where we going?
- We're in it.

04:43.260 --> 04:46.046
- Yes. Yes.
- Miami, Opa-Locka flavors.

04:46.089 --> 04:47.961
- Citrus, seafood.
- Good.

04:48.004 --> 04:50.877
I am mixing my Southern roots
with French cuisine,

04:50.920 --> 04:52.879
and hopefully give you
a feel of, like,

04:52.922 --> 04:55.664
that Michelin star flair.

04:55.707 --> 04:58.232
I am going to wow you.

04:58.275 --> 05:00.016
Forget everybody around you,

05:00.060 --> 05:02.105
- and focus on three things.
- Okay.

05:02.149 --> 05:05.108
- The appetizer, the entrée,
and the dessert.
- Yes. Yes.

05:05.152 --> 05:07.981
- Ignore everything else.
- Everything else.

05:08.024 --> 05:09.547
Steely focus, that's what you
need to bring to the finale.

05:09.591 --> 05:11.027
- Okay?
- Yes. Yes.

05:11.071 --> 05:13.116
I am ready to kick some butt.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.684
- Good luck. You can do this.
- Thank you, Chef.
Thank you. Oh!

05:15.727 --> 05:18.295
I cannot wait for this finale.

Today, I want you
to write about a story

05:28.044 --> 05:30.133
that you plan to tell
your children someday.

05:30.177 --> 05:31.918
Being back home has
been amazing.

05:31.961 --> 05:35.008
To see my kids' faces
for the first time in months,

05:35.051 --> 05:36.139
it means the world to me.

05:36.183 --> 05:37.488
Something
that you've experienced.

05:37.532 --> 05:41.014
- Okay?
- [ knocking on door ]

05:41.057 --> 05:43.146
Mr. Hurt,
can I interrupt your class?

05:43.190 --> 05:46.149
- Oh, my goodness!
- How are you?

05:46.193 --> 05:47.934
With the finale right
around the corner,

05:47.977 --> 05:49.500
I've been cooking
every single day.

05:49.544 --> 05:51.285
What's going on, guys?

05:51.328 --> 05:54.375
I've really been pushing myself
to focus on plating,

05:54.418 --> 05:56.594
so that I can bring
that MasterChef trophy home.

05:56.638 --> 05:59.249
So, I invested one
of my eight aprons in him,

05:59.293 --> 06:02.165
'cause I believed
that he had the passion,
and he had the skills,

06:02.209 --> 06:03.950
and I think the greatest thing

06:03.993 --> 06:05.560
is he is
an incredible student.

06:05.603 --> 06:06.909
So, I'd love to hear from

06:06.953 --> 06:09.303
some of you guys
the impact that Mr. Hurt

06:09.346 --> 06:11.827
has had on you and your lives
in this classroom.

06:11.871 --> 06:15.048
Like, when he came,
I just thought he was gonna
be like another teacher,

06:15.091 --> 06:17.180
but he actually was
connecting with students.

06:17.224 --> 06:19.269
Like, he actually came
to the basketball games.

06:19.313 --> 06:20.967
He'll leave his door open
for students

06:21.010 --> 06:23.752
to come in during lunch
and stuff like that.

06:23.795 --> 06:26.407
We don't really have that many
male figures in this school.

06:26.450 --> 06:28.844
We can really relate
to Mr. Hurt.

06:28.888 --> 06:29.976
His background
is similar to mine.

06:30.019 --> 06:31.978
Just knowing
how far he's come,

06:32.021 --> 06:35.068
I feel like I can achieve
the same-- the same thing.

06:35.111 --> 06:37.984
My students, they grow up
in these rough neighborhoods
and rough communities.

06:38.027 --> 06:40.987
- [ school bell rings ]
- Well, guys, thanks
for sharing your stories.

06:41.030 --> 06:42.205
I know where they come from.

06:42.249 --> 06:43.641
I've been there
and I've done that.

06:43.685 --> 06:45.513
And so if I win
the MasterChef title,

06:45.556 --> 06:47.210
I'm taking that money back

06:47.254 --> 06:49.865
and I'm going to open up
a culinary institute

06:49.909 --> 06:51.998
to make sure that I give
my students a chance

06:52.041 --> 06:54.217
so that they can better
themselves.

06:54.261 --> 06:56.437
So you've been here
in Nashville two years now.

06:56.480 --> 06:59.005
You know, you came in
with Southern flavors.

06:59.048 --> 07:01.529
I'm sure that has its roots
here in Nashville.
Tell me about that.

07:01.572 --> 07:03.444
The food scene here
is amazing.

07:03.487 --> 07:06.360
Hot chicken is something
that I experienced
when I first got here,

07:06.403 --> 07:08.449
and I got into
the MasterChef kitchen
on hot chicken.

07:08.492 --> 07:10.320
Speaking of that,
finale's coming.

07:10.364 --> 07:12.192
- What are you thinking?
- Southern. Southern.

07:12.235 --> 07:14.237
You know, any time
I can stay true to my roots,

07:14.281 --> 07:15.673
it's gave me positive results.

07:15.717 --> 07:17.327
But I tell you what,
it's gotta be elevated, though.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.460
- It-- it does.
- So I'm gonna give you
some advice.

a really luxurious restaurant

to your roots is fundamental,

in the finale.

of people in this country.

and she couldn't continue
that career here

because she stayed home
to take care of us,

which was the most
important thing.

something with duck.

09:17.317 --> 09:19.145
- Patomaybe as my entrée.
- Mm-hmm?

09:19.188 --> 09:21.799
Chocolate definitely
in the dessert,

09:21.843 --> 09:24.367
'cause, you know,
Mexico, Aztecs, chocolate.

09:24.411 --> 09:26.587
It's the appetizer
where I'm still a little iffy.

09:26.630 --> 09:28.806
Well, think about what
is the basis of Mexican food.

09:28.850 --> 09:31.940
- Yes, Chef.
- And hopefully being home
will allow you

09:31.983 --> 09:34.160
to get inspiration and love

09:34.203 --> 09:36.249
from the people that care
about you the most, okay?

09:36.292 --> 09:39.034
[ speaking Spanish ]

09:39.078 --> 09:41.297
It's so refreshing
to have my mentor here.

09:41.341 --> 09:42.820
I definitely needed
that guidance.

09:42.864 --> 09:44.387
Thank you very much,
everybody.

09:44.431 --> 09:45.562
I appreciate you guys so much.

09:45.606 --> 09:48.043
I only have one shot
to get this right,

09:48.087 --> 09:49.566
so I'm focused,
I'm determined.

09:49.610 --> 09:51.046
Bye, Chef!

09:51.090 --> 09:53.570
I have to bring
everything I have

09:53.614 --> 09:56.747
to take that trophy home.

09:56.791 --> 09:59.272
[ cheers and applause ]

09:59.315 --> 10:02.144
Up first in this three-way
culinary battle,

10:02.188 --> 10:04.103
a young man in my apron.

10:05.321 --> 10:06.583
Cesar.

10:06.627 --> 10:08.629
[ cheers and applause ]

10:11.893 --> 10:13.982
A 33-year-old high school
English teacher

10:14.025 --> 10:16.332
from Houston, Texas.

10:16.376 --> 10:19.422
The first hurdle
that stands in Cesar's way

10:19.466 --> 10:21.816
is a home cook
that took my apron.

10:21.859 --> 10:24.558
My protégé, Ashley.

10:24.601 --> 10:26.429
[ cheers and applause ]

10:26.473 --> 10:28.953
A 28-year-old professional
grocery shopper

10:28.997 --> 10:31.086
from Opa-Locka, Florida.

10:31.130 --> 10:35.221
And our final home cook,
a young man

10:35.264 --> 10:39.181
that I have mentored through
the entire competition,

10:39.225 --> 10:40.226
Gerron.

10:40.269 --> 10:42.097
[ cheers and applause ]

10:42.141 --> 10:44.230
A 25-year-old English teacher

10:44.273 --> 10:46.101
from Louisville, Kentucky.

10:46.145 --> 10:49.148
[ cheers and applause ]

10:56.067 --> 10:58.069
[ crowd laughs ]

11:08.384 --> 11:09.907
Now, throughout
this competition

11:09.951 --> 11:11.213
you've had a lot of obstacles
thrown your way,

11:11.257 --> 11:13.911
including extremely
talented opponents.

11:13.955 --> 11:17.045
But tonight, they've all
returned to cheer you on.

11:17.088 --> 11:19.090
[ cheering ]

11:21.397 --> 11:22.746
Much love.

11:25.532 --> 11:27.186
Thank you.

11:30.711 --> 11:33.670
Shanika:
Yes! Yes! Get it!

11:33.714 --> 11:37.500
And then of course,
your family are here

11:37.544 --> 11:40.938
in the MasterChef kitchen
to support all of you.

11:40.982 --> 11:44.507
Cesar, you have your mom Maria

11:44.551 --> 11:46.379
and your sisters
Elda and Diana.

11:46.422 --> 11:50.731
Ashley, here to support you
is your boyfriend Damien,

11:50.774 --> 11:54.082
your father Henry,
and your mother Aletha.

11:54.125 --> 11:56.693
Gerron, here
supporting you tonight

11:56.737 --> 11:59.087
is your fiancée Brandi,

11:59.130 --> 12:00.741
your father Christopher,

12:00.784 --> 12:02.786
and your grandma Elizabeth.

12:05.746 --> 12:08.270
It's now time to put together
the best three-course dinner

12:08.314 --> 12:11.534
you could ever dream of.

12:11.578 --> 12:13.971
One incredible appetizer,
one stunning entrée,

12:14.015 --> 12:17.105
and one delicious dessert.

12:17.148 --> 12:20.761
Your reputations and ours
are on the line.

12:20.804 --> 12:25.766
This time,
there are three judges
that want to win,

12:25.809 --> 12:31.728
and that means we expect
a three-course masterpiece.

12:31.772 --> 12:33.991
You'll each have ten minutes
in the pantry

12:34.035 --> 12:36.733
to collect everything
that you need to cook us

12:36.777 --> 12:41.216
the best three-course dinner
of your lives.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.741
Your time in the pantry
starts...

12:49.790 --> 12:51.574
...now. Let's go.

12:51.618 --> 12:53.359
- [ cheering ]
- Let's go, baby!

12:53.402 --> 12:55.230
- Let's go!
- [ cheering ]

12:57.188 --> 13:00.366
This is the battle
of the century...

13:00.409 --> 13:02.803
Raspberries.

13:02.846 --> 13:05.371
...and my money is
all on Gerron at this point.

13:05.414 --> 13:07.373
Smoked paprika.

13:07.416 --> 13:08.939
Ralph:
He's been the underdog
since day one,

13:08.983 --> 13:11.942
but his passion and drive
for how he cooks

13:11.986 --> 13:14.554
is the reason why he's here.

13:14.597 --> 13:17.470
I have no doubt in my mind
that Gerron is gonna be
the next MasterChef.

13:17.513 --> 13:19.341
Gotcha, thank you.

13:19.385 --> 13:20.386
Emily:
There's only one person
that is gonna win it all.

13:20.429 --> 13:22.213
I think it's Cesar.

13:22.257 --> 13:23.824
He's got the knife skills
and the food knowledge.

13:23.867 --> 13:25.521
He has experience.

13:25.565 --> 13:27.436
Under this pressure,
he's gonna be focused

13:27.480 --> 13:28.394
and he's gonna get it done,

13:28.437 --> 13:30.396
and hopefully come out on top.

13:30.439 --> 13:33.616
Shanika:
I want Ashley to win.

13:33.660 --> 13:35.575
Come on, I'm from Miami.
If I couldn't take it,

13:35.618 --> 13:38.360
somebody from South Florida
needs to bring this home.

13:38.404 --> 13:39.622
Collard greens.

13:39.666 --> 13:41.450
Shanika:
Ashley is a powerhouse.

13:41.494 --> 13:43.844
She has become so fierce
in this kitchen,

13:43.887 --> 13:45.628
and that is the attitude
that you need

13:45.672 --> 13:47.674
to take this trophy home.

13:49.676 --> 13:51.765
[ cheers and applause ]

13:51.808 --> 13:55.203
- Let's go!
- Come on, Cesar!

13:55.246 --> 13:56.378
Let's go!

13:58.293 --> 13:59.903
- Let's go, Gerron!
- Whoo!

14:10.044 --> 14:11.872
Cesar, Ashley, and Gerron,

14:11.915 --> 14:16.572
the grand finale is
about to begin.

14:16.616 --> 14:20.837
And, of course, it all starts
with the appetizers.

14:20.881 --> 14:23.884
Cesar, what will you be making
for your appetizer?

14:23.927 --> 14:27.540
I'll be preparing a squid ink
infladita with lobster,

14:27.583 --> 14:30.107
dragon fruit salsa,
and a roasted poblano sauce.

14:30.151 --> 14:33.241
Ashley, what will you be making
for your appetizer?

14:33.284 --> 14:35.678
Tonight, I'm preparing
a pan-seared red snapper

14:35.722 --> 14:38.464
with spicy conch salad,
malanga fritters,

14:38.507 --> 14:40.683
and an ají coconut sauce.

14:40.727 --> 14:43.817
Gerron, what are you gonna be
making for your first course?

14:43.860 --> 14:46.689
Tonight, I'll be making
a Nashville hot quail

14:46.733 --> 14:49.910
with a fingerling potato salad
and poached quail eggs.

14:49.953 --> 14:51.868
This is it.

14:51.912 --> 14:55.568
You'll have just one hour

14:55.611 --> 14:57.047
to make us
your amazing appetizers.

14:57.091 --> 14:59.485
Three plates of each.
Are you ready?

14:59.528 --> 15:00.834
- Yeah!
- Yes, Joe!

15:00.877 --> 15:02.139
Don't let us down.

15:04.359 --> 15:07.406
Your time starts...

15:10.887 --> 15:14.630
- ...now.
- [ cheers and applause ]

15:16.763 --> 15:18.417
This is it! Let's go!

15:21.202 --> 15:25.554
- You got this, Gerron!
- Go, Ashley! Whoo!

15:27.730 --> 15:31.125
- [ cheering ]
- Come on, Cesar!

15:31.168 --> 15:33.475
This is it.
I mean, one of the most

15:33.519 --> 15:35.085
important nights
of their culinary career.

15:35.129 --> 15:37.305
Also, a big night for us.

15:37.348 --> 15:40.177
For the first time, we are
competing against each other.

15:40.221 --> 15:43.485
- May the best judge win.
- We lit, baby. We lit.

15:43.529 --> 15:45.313
Ashley:
We gotta move fast,
baby, tonight.

15:45.356 --> 15:47.533
- Come on, Gerron!
- Let's go! Come on!

15:51.101 --> 15:52.276
[ cheers and applause ]

15:52.320 --> 15:53.495
- Come on, guys!
- Let's go!

15:53.539 --> 15:56.890
This is it.
The MasterChef grand finale.

15:56.933 --> 15:58.326
Whoop, whoop, baby,
whoop, whoop.

15:58.369 --> 16:00.502
- Whoop, whoop!
- Heard that.

16:00.546 --> 16:03.592
This year we're mentoring
individual talent.

16:03.636 --> 16:06.421
- Go, Ashley!
- Yes, we're highly competitive,

16:06.465 --> 16:08.597
but we're gonna be judges to all
three of them this evening.

16:08.641 --> 16:10.294
If your contestant
or your contestant

16:10.338 --> 16:11.948
gives me the best dishes
of the night,

16:11.992 --> 16:13.689
- Yes.
- I'm gonna be with you
in crowning them

16:13.733 --> 16:16.649
- Sure.
- as America's next MasterChef.

16:16.692 --> 16:19.695
Gerron, he's doing
Nashville hot quail.

16:19.739 --> 16:21.741
It's his audition dish.

16:21.784 --> 16:23.394
He's taken it
from a chicken to a quail.

16:23.438 --> 16:24.787
Does he know how to cook
a quail properly?

16:24.831 --> 16:25.527
He's never cooked
a quail before.

16:25.571 --> 16:26.963
Gerron:
There we go.

16:27.007 --> 16:28.356
30 seconds over on the quail,

16:28.399 --> 16:30.140
it's gonna be a dry quail.

16:30.184 --> 16:31.577
It's a big risk, but that's
the kind of guy he is.

16:31.620 --> 16:33.970
He's taken the tradition,
he's evolved it.

16:34.014 --> 16:35.885
The guy's honest,
he cooks with a lot of heart,

16:35.929 --> 16:38.105
- Sure.
- and everything tells a story.

16:38.148 --> 16:40.977
The way that Gerron
could fall down is that
his dish is too simple,

16:41.021 --> 16:42.892
- the flavors are not elevated.
- Gordon: Yeah.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.633
Gordon:
Fingerling potatoes
and quail's eggs,

16:44.677 --> 16:46.026
I don't know
if you can elevate that.

16:46.069 --> 16:47.593
There's only so far you can go
with that stuff.

16:47.636 --> 16:50.683
What worries me
a little bit
is his plating.

16:50.726 --> 16:51.727
He's made a lot
of progress.

16:51.771 --> 16:53.250
It's still a concern.

16:53.294 --> 16:54.991
Where that Team Ashley at?

16:55.035 --> 16:57.820
[ cheering ]

16:57.864 --> 16:59.648
So, Ashley's appetizer.

16:59.692 --> 17:02.216
That pan-seared red snapper
with a Floridian salsa

17:02.259 --> 17:05.828
with conch in there.
She's playing to her strengths.

17:05.872 --> 17:07.613
She's cooking food
from her back garden.

17:07.656 --> 17:08.788
Aaron:
But the idea of conch,

17:08.831 --> 17:10.485
it's a sea snail
from the Caribbean.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.792
It's a very difficult
shellfish to nail.

17:12.835 --> 17:14.576
Listen, if there's one person
in this competition

17:14.620 --> 17:15.664
who can nail it,
it's Ashley.

17:15.708 --> 17:17.666
Another habanero, some mango.

17:17.710 --> 17:20.190
You know what?
Ashley using so much fruit,

17:20.234 --> 17:22.192
are you concerned
that sometimes managing

17:22.236 --> 17:23.977
the sweetness
and the acidity of fruit,

17:24.020 --> 17:26.719
whether it be citrus,
mangos, pineapple?

17:26.762 --> 17:28.503
That is a good question, but
she's got two proteins there--

17:28.547 --> 17:30.374
the pan-fried red snapper
and, of course, the conch.

17:30.418 --> 17:32.072
So, you know, you need
to balance that up

17:32.115 --> 17:33.987
with the heat, the sweet,
and that level of acidity.

17:34.030 --> 17:38.687
- You got this, Cesar!
- Sorry, little guy.

17:38.731 --> 17:39.993
- Oh.
- Oh, gosh.

17:40.036 --> 17:42.256
I apologized before doing it,
all right?

17:42.299 --> 17:44.650
- [ laughter ]
- Cesar's taken a very humble

17:44.693 --> 17:46.869
ingredient like
the corn tortilla,

17:46.913 --> 17:49.829
elevating it by putting
squid ink into it, frying it,

17:49.872 --> 17:52.179
so it can puff up and house
all this beautiful lobster

17:52.222 --> 17:53.180
and different elements
in there.

17:53.223 --> 17:54.747
Whoo!

17:54.790 --> 17:57.401
[ speaking Spanish ]

17:57.445 --> 17:59.186
Aarón:
There's a lot riding
on the execution

17:59.229 --> 18:01.014
of that little
puffed up tortilla.

18:01.057 --> 18:04.278
But why take a risk just
as a shell to put lobster in?

18:04.321 --> 18:06.802
It's texture, it's flavor,

18:06.846 --> 18:08.238
and it's a striking
presentation.

18:08.282 --> 18:09.762
Joe:
It's made with squid ink.

18:09.805 --> 18:11.851
That seems kind of, like,
really off the rails for me.

18:11.894 --> 18:14.288
Aarón:
Well, do they make squid ink
pasta in Italy?

18:14.331 --> 18:16.464
They do, but they've done it
for centuries.

18:16.507 --> 18:18.814
Have they made squid ink
tortillas in Mexico
for centuries?

18:18.858 --> 18:20.729
- They have not.
- Okay.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.255
We are 15 minutes down.

18:25.299 --> 18:27.606
We have 45 minutes to go, guys.
Come on.

18:30.086 --> 18:32.045
- Whoo!
- Come on, Gerron!
Come on, Gerron!

18:32.088 --> 18:34.830
Okay, Gerron, tell me
about your appetizer.

18:34.874 --> 18:36.092
What I wanna do tonight

18:36.136 --> 18:38.442
is to elevate
my Nashville hot chicken

18:38.486 --> 18:39.922
by doing it with a quail.

18:39.966 --> 18:41.445
Quail is much bonier,
much smaller.

18:41.489 --> 18:43.317
- Gerron: It is.
- The meat's dark, not white.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.014
Will it take the spice?
Will it take the heat?

18:45.058 --> 18:46.581
Does it translate?

18:46.625 --> 18:47.800
Are you taking
such a big risk

18:47.843 --> 18:49.715
with swapping out quail
for chicken?

18:49.758 --> 18:51.934
- Can you make it work?
- I can definitely make it work,

18:51.978 --> 18:52.935
and I'll let you
be the judge of that.

18:52.979 --> 18:55.677
[ cheering ]

18:55.721 --> 18:57.070
Eye on the prize, baby.

18:57.113 --> 18:58.680
I'm bringing it home
for us, you know?

18:58.724 --> 19:00.943
- We can go to Italy.
- You wanna go to Italy with me?

19:00.987 --> 19:04.512
I do. I wanna go
and you gotta make sure
your mother's there.

19:04.555 --> 19:06.949
If we go to Italy
to meet my mama,
you have to pay,

19:06.993 --> 19:09.299
because you'll be
a quarter of a million
dollars richer, I think.

19:09.343 --> 19:10.736
I'll pay for you.

19:10.779 --> 19:12.781
- You'll pay for me?
- I'll pay for you.

19:12.825 --> 19:15.697
- Do you speak Italian, Gerron?
- I don't, but you know what?

19:15.741 --> 19:17.699
- I'm a quick learner.
- I'm gonna leave you one word.

19:17.743 --> 19:19.527
Buona fortuna,my friend.
Good luck.

19:19.570 --> 19:21.094
Thank you! Thank you, Joe.

19:21.137 --> 19:22.617
Yeah!

19:22.661 --> 19:25.838
Gordon:
30 minutes remaining.

19:25.881 --> 19:27.709
- 30, heard.
- Let's go, Ash!

19:29.755 --> 19:32.061
- Right, young lady.
- Yes, Chef.

19:32.105 --> 19:34.368
- Give us an insight
into the dish.
- Living in Opa-Locka,

19:34.411 --> 19:36.196
you live around so many
different cultures.

19:36.239 --> 19:38.546
My grandfather
has roots in Bahamas.

19:38.589 --> 19:40.635
- Wow.
- So that's where the conch
salad representation is.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.637
I have an aunt who's Peruvian,

19:42.681 --> 19:44.421
- so that's why the sauce
has that theme.
- Love it.

19:44.465 --> 19:46.989
And then, you know,
in Miami you can get
locally caught seafood

19:47.033 --> 19:49.862
- all day, every day.
So, it's a representation
- Yeah.

19:49.905 --> 19:52.299
of my childhood
and my foundation in culinary.

19:52.342 --> 19:54.649
That skin on that snapper
is delicious when it gets
nice and crispy.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.783
- How you gonna cook it?
- I'm pan-searing it
in some oil,

19:57.826 --> 20:00.611
and then afterwards,
I'm gonna rotate it over

20:00.655 --> 20:02.309
- and baste it
in a lot of butter.
- Yeah.

20:02.352 --> 20:06.182
Put everything you know,
live for, breathe for,
on that plate.

20:06.226 --> 20:08.315
- Yes, Chef. Thank you.
- Good luck, Ashley.

20:08.358 --> 20:09.359
She ready.

20:10.883 --> 20:12.754
Gordon:
20 minutes remaining.

20:12.798 --> 20:13.799
Come on!

20:13.842 --> 20:16.671
- Go, Cesar!
- Come on, Cesar!

20:16.715 --> 20:18.238
- Cesar!
- Chef Aarón, how are you?

20:18.281 --> 20:19.892
- How are you, my man?
- I'm doing great, Chef.

20:19.935 --> 20:21.328
- You doing good?
- Yes, Chef.

20:21.371 --> 20:22.677
So, talk to me
about your appetizer.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.418
I'm doing an infladita,

20:24.461 --> 20:26.768
which is corn dough that you
part cook on the griddle

20:26.812 --> 20:28.552
and then you throw it
in the deep fryer,

20:28.596 --> 20:30.119
so they puff up,
make a hollow shell.

20:30.163 --> 20:31.817
And then I'm gonna fill it in
with this lobster

20:31.860 --> 20:33.993
that's gonna get tossed
in this tomato sauce, Chef.

20:34.036 --> 20:35.429
Cesar, a lot
can go wrong with that.

20:35.472 --> 20:38.040
What happens if
the infladitas don't puff up?

20:38.084 --> 20:39.694
Well, then I might have to
change the shape of my dough

20:39.738 --> 20:40.913
and call it
something else, Chef.

20:40.956 --> 20:42.479
- I got you.
- [ laughter ]

20:42.523 --> 20:44.351
So, this might be a taco
by the end of the day, huh?

20:44.394 --> 20:46.788
- Exactly, pretty much.
- All right, Cesar,

20:46.832 --> 20:48.050
- keep your eye
on the prize, mijo.
- Yes, Chef.

20:48.094 --> 20:49.182
All right?
You're almost there.

20:49.225 --> 20:50.183
- Almost there.
- Come on.

20:50.226 --> 20:51.706
- Go, Cesar!
- Bring it home!

20:51.750 --> 20:54.796
We are coming down
to ten minutes to go.

20:54.840 --> 20:55.797
Come on, guys, pick it up.

20:55.841 --> 20:58.800
Ten minutes, baby,
ten minutes.

20:58.844 --> 21:02.935
With minutes to go,
Cesar, he may have to
change direction,

21:02.978 --> 21:04.153
because once they are toasted,

21:04.197 --> 21:05.807
he puts them
in the fryer to blister.

21:05.851 --> 21:07.156
It's that blister
that puffs them, right?

21:07.200 --> 21:08.941
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Almost like a soufflé potato.

21:08.984 --> 21:10.856
- Exactly.
- If it doesn't puff up,
where do you go?

21:10.899 --> 21:13.467
- He's gonna be in trouble.
- He's doing them now.

21:13.510 --> 21:14.903
- Yeah, he's actually
doing it right now.
- So, he's doing them now.

21:17.079 --> 21:18.472
He's giving me
a heart attack.

21:18.515 --> 21:20.953
It's hot.

21:20.996 --> 21:22.911
Cesar, are they puffing up?

21:22.955 --> 21:24.957
Oh, my God.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.176
Oh, my God.

21:27.220 --> 21:29.004
[ groans ]

21:36.098 --> 21:38.013
If it doesn't puff up,
where do you go?

21:38.057 --> 21:41.887
- He's gonna be in trouble.
- It's hot.

21:41.930 --> 21:43.976
Cesar, are they puffing up?

21:44.019 --> 21:46.108
Oh, my God.

21:46.152 --> 21:47.849
- Oh, my God.
- [ groans ]

21:47.893 --> 21:49.895
Gordon:
Cesar.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.335
[ sighing ]

21:55.378 --> 21:57.250
[ speaking Spanish ]

21:57.293 --> 21:59.992
That's puffed, right?
You all see it?

22:00.035 --> 22:03.125
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, mijo,you got it!

22:03.169 --> 22:04.910
- Do they collapse?
- Aarón: No, not at all.

22:04.953 --> 22:06.128
As long as they have
enough time to rest--

22:06.172 --> 22:08.000
Gordon:
Wow.

22:08.043 --> 22:09.958
Quail eggs, quail eggs,
quail eggs, quail eggs.

22:10.002 --> 22:10.872
Where are they?
There they're going.

22:10.916 --> 22:14.136
Joe, here's a $250,000 question.

22:14.180 --> 22:17.096
How is Gerron's
big fingers and hands

22:17.139 --> 22:18.793
gonna peel a quail egg?

22:18.837 --> 22:20.577
Yes, he does have big hands,
but I told him

22:20.621 --> 22:22.014
think small, think dainty,

22:22.057 --> 22:23.015
and I think
he's gonna make it.

22:23.058 --> 22:25.060
Come on, gotta speed it up.

22:26.366 --> 22:28.150
We're down
to five minutes to go.

22:28.194 --> 22:30.283
- This is it, guys.
- Cesar!

22:30.326 --> 22:32.938
- Gerron!
- Go!

22:32.981 --> 22:35.331
- Ashley!
- Gordon: Ashley.

22:35.375 --> 22:37.725
She's learned
so much from the competition.
She's tasting everything.

22:37.768 --> 22:40.380
Joe:
All that sweetness and acidity,
she'd better taste everything,

22:40.423 --> 22:41.947
because she's walking
a high wire.

22:41.990 --> 22:43.513
Is she gonna
overcook her snapper?

22:43.557 --> 22:45.080
No, definitely not
overcooking the snapper.

22:45.124 --> 22:46.952
90% of that cooking
will take place in that skin.

22:46.995 --> 22:48.823
So you'll see that crispness,

22:48.867 --> 22:50.172
and that'll protect the fish
and keep it moist.

22:50.216 --> 22:51.957
That snapper is so difficult
to cook right.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.523
You have
to get it just right.

22:53.567 --> 22:55.177
It could be too dry.
I'm nervous.

22:55.221 --> 22:57.571
Gordon:
My one concern
with Gerron right now?

22:57.614 --> 23:00.748
He's spendt so long
on those quail eggs.
It's insignificant.

23:00.791 --> 23:03.011
Now he's putting
dots on the plate,
fingerling potatoes.

23:03.055 --> 23:04.795
- The hero is the quail.
- Yeah.

23:04.839 --> 23:06.580
Focus on the quail,
get it on the plate first,

23:06.623 --> 23:10.062
and then put all
your little extras on.

23:10.105 --> 23:12.064
Cesar has so much
he has to do.

23:12.107 --> 23:13.761
He has to break
those little infladas,

23:13.804 --> 23:16.111
stuff them with
his lobster mixture, plate,

23:16.155 --> 23:18.635
and he's been known to do
very elaborate plating.

23:18.679 --> 23:20.420
Joe:
So with three minutes to go,

23:20.463 --> 23:22.552
- Cesar has nothing
on the plate yet.
- Nothing.

23:22.596 --> 23:24.598
[ speaking Spanish ]

23:26.861 --> 23:27.862
Woman: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Start plating, start plating.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.429
Whoo! Let's go!

23:29.472 --> 23:31.997
I just don't think he's gonna
finish in time.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.435
Not only that,
his tortilla shell is hot,

23:35.478 --> 23:37.437
his lobster mixture's hot.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.221
- Is that gonna break
the integrity of it?
- Yeah.

23:39.265 --> 23:42.094
Last minute!

23:42.137 --> 23:44.183
60 seconds to go!
Come on, guys.

23:44.226 --> 23:47.664
- 60 seconds, Cesar!
- One minute, Cesar!

23:47.708 --> 23:49.188
Pressure ain't nothing
to you, Gerron!

23:49.231 --> 23:51.451
- Gordon: Come on, Gerron!
- Let's go!

23:51.494 --> 23:53.670
- [ cheering ]
- Let's go, Ash! Let's go!

23:53.714 --> 23:56.891
- Come on, Ash!
- 30 seconds to go!

23:56.935 --> 23:58.458
- Come on!
- Come on! Whoo!

23:58.501 --> 24:01.026
- Let's go!
- You got it, you got it! Yes!

24:01.069 --> 24:03.463
- Come on, come on!
Go, go, go!
- You got it! Whoo!

24:03.506 --> 24:06.031
- Let's go, come on!
- Aarón: Come on, Gerron.
Let's go! Garnish!

24:06.074 --> 24:07.684
- Gerron:
There you go! That's right!
- Go, Ashley.

24:07.728 --> 24:09.034
- Go, Ash!
- That's right!

24:09.077 --> 24:10.905
10 seconds to go.

24:10.949 --> 24:14.082
All:
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

24:14.126 --> 24:17.433
six, five, four, three,

24:17.477 --> 24:19.044
- two, one!
- Stop!

24:19.087 --> 24:22.221
- Well done!
- [ cheers and applause ]

24:23.918 --> 24:27.269
- [ muttering ]
- Oh, man.

24:27.313 --> 24:30.098
- Well done.
- Oh, my God!

24:31.882 --> 24:33.928
Now, all the three of you,
please very carefully

24:33.972 --> 24:35.234
bring your appetizers
down to the front.

24:35.277 --> 24:37.323
[ cheering ]

24:40.152 --> 24:41.327
Yeah!

24:46.071 --> 24:50.466
Cesar, Ashley, Gerron,
these dishes look phenomenal.

24:50.510 --> 24:52.903
They're so unique
and distinct.

24:52.947 --> 24:54.470
You have done us proud,

24:54.514 --> 24:56.951
and you have done
yourselves proud.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.301
Please bring
those stunning appetizers

24:59.345 --> 25:02.957
into the MasterChef
restaurant.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.742
Ashley:
The appetizer round
sets the bar

25:05.786 --> 25:08.267
for my three-course meal,

25:08.310 --> 25:12.967
and that's why I wanted
to deliver on all cylinders.

25:13.011 --> 25:16.101
I'm representing
Chef Gordon in this,

25:16.144 --> 25:17.276
and I didn't come
to play it safe tonight.

25:17.319 --> 25:19.756
I really am going in

25:19.800 --> 25:22.107
with a lot of technique
and a lot of skill set

25:22.150 --> 25:25.066
that I want the judges
to see with this appetizer.

25:25.110 --> 25:28.026
Right. Ashley,
please present us
your appetizer.

25:40.038 --> 25:42.127
Ashley, please describe
this dish.

25:42.170 --> 25:44.129
Tonight,
I have prepared for you

25:44.172 --> 25:47.175
a pan-seared red snapper
with spicy conch salad,

25:47.219 --> 25:50.222
malanga fritters,
and an ají coconut sauce.

25:50.265 --> 25:53.355
This plate
has a lot going on.

25:53.399 --> 25:55.096
So the first thing
we need to see

25:55.140 --> 25:58.708
is obviously the star protein
of the dish, your snapper.

25:58.752 --> 26:00.710
When I cut it open,
it should glisten,

26:00.754 --> 26:02.103
it should be moist,
it should be flaky.

26:02.147 --> 26:04.366
- We don't want it to be dry.
- Yes, Joe.

26:04.410 --> 26:08.153
If you have not cooked
the snapper properly,

26:08.196 --> 26:11.025
that would put you significantly
behind in this competition.

26:11.069 --> 26:14.028
- I'm ready.
- Let's take a look.

26:21.427 --> 26:25.039
I have to say, Ashley,
this snapper, for me, is...

26:33.787 --> 26:34.788
Ashley...

26:38.052 --> 26:39.488
I have to say, Ashley, this--

26:39.532 --> 26:42.448
snapper, for me, is...

26:43.623 --> 26:45.103
overcooked and dry.

26:47.235 --> 26:50.282
That's a pretty novice
mistake to make

26:50.325 --> 26:52.458
at this point
in the competition.

27:00.553 --> 27:02.424
There's an incredible
heat component in the fritter.

27:02.468 --> 27:04.209
- What is that?
- Scotch bonnet.

27:04.252 --> 27:06.298
The heat is
very, very aggressive.

27:06.341 --> 27:08.213
- Okay.
- You took a big risk,

27:08.256 --> 27:10.171
but the dish as a whole

27:10.215 --> 27:12.782
just reeked
of too much ambition.

27:12.826 --> 27:17.657
Ashley, I love
your courageous nature
of cooking,

27:17.700 --> 27:21.443
and I'm sorry my colleagues
have very European palates.

27:21.487 --> 27:24.403
That spice is perfect.
It tastes like the sun.

27:24.446 --> 27:28.407
It's warm.
And the cook on the snapper,
for me, is good.

27:28.450 --> 27:30.104
It's right there.
It's textbook.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.367
- Really great job.
- Thank you.

27:32.411 --> 27:34.326
- Ashley?
- Yes, Chef?

27:34.369 --> 27:36.545
Um, my fish
was cooked beautifully.

27:36.589 --> 27:40.288
The seasoning's on point.
Fritters, delicious.

27:40.332 --> 27:43.639
But there's one issue
with this.

27:43.683 --> 27:46.338
This coconut sauce,
it broke.

27:46.381 --> 27:48.035
When you stick
that amount of heat

27:48.078 --> 27:50.559
on top of a sauce like that,
it'll break.

27:50.603 --> 27:53.214
So you need to be smart
in emulsifying that

27:53.258 --> 27:55.912
and don't let
that residual heat
from the snapper spoil it.

27:55.956 --> 27:57.740
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef.

28:03.311 --> 28:05.008
Next up, the young
home cook that I chose

28:05.052 --> 28:07.446
to give my apron to, Cesar.

28:18.370 --> 28:20.154
So I have
a squid ink infladita,

28:20.198 --> 28:21.503
which means "puffed one,"

28:21.547 --> 28:23.026
filled with lobster.

28:23.070 --> 28:25.594
Then I have a dragon fruit pico
on the outside,

28:25.638 --> 28:28.510
caviar, and a roasted
poblano sauce.

28:28.554 --> 28:29.816
I'm always marveled by you.

28:29.859 --> 28:31.339
I'm inspired by the way

28:31.383 --> 28:34.299
that you view Mexican food
in particular.

28:34.342 --> 28:35.952
My concern, very simply,

28:35.996 --> 28:38.085
is that did you
put one element too much

28:38.128 --> 28:40.827
to overpower
all these different flavors?

28:40.870 --> 28:43.482
Uh, no. I think
everything I chose

28:43.525 --> 28:44.918
to go on there
complements everything else,

28:44.961 --> 28:46.702
and I think I found
balance in that plate.

28:56.016 --> 28:58.497
Aarón:
Cesar, that corn flavor
of the inflada

28:58.540 --> 28:59.715
comes out beautifully,

28:59.759 --> 29:01.978
and it kind of becomes
this little sponge

29:02.022 --> 29:04.851
for all that wonderful
flavor of the lobster
I just dig so much.

29:04.894 --> 29:06.418
What I don't like,
dragon fruit's

29:06.461 --> 29:08.333
a very difficult fruit
to master,

29:08.376 --> 29:09.943
and I think it doesn't
belong on this dish.

29:09.986 --> 29:11.292
Okay.

29:11.336 --> 29:12.989
- But really impressive.
- Thank you.

29:13.033 --> 29:14.861
I have to say, Cesar,

29:14.904 --> 29:18.995
this dish hits the standard
of excellence in the plating.

29:19.039 --> 29:20.432
Thank you, Joe.

29:20.475 --> 29:22.869
Joe: The poblano has
a nice smoky richness.

29:22.912 --> 29:24.697
What really kind of
makes this dish sing

29:24.740 --> 29:27.177
is that the lobster
is cooked very well

29:27.221 --> 29:28.918
and seasoned really well.

29:28.962 --> 29:30.703
- Excellent job.
Very impressive.
- Thank you.

29:30.746 --> 29:35.360
I think "MasterChef" has just
had their first "UFL" landing.

29:35.403 --> 29:37.362
- Unidentified Flying Lobster.
- [ chuckles ]

29:37.405 --> 29:38.972
I mean, it looks
like a spaceship.

29:39.015 --> 29:40.539
A very posh spaceship.

29:40.582 --> 29:44.151
But I love the ambition.
You've nailed the lobster.

29:44.194 --> 29:45.674
Lobster's cooked
beautifully, sweet.

29:45.718 --> 29:47.154
The roasted poblano sauce,

29:47.197 --> 29:48.808
the heat is just
beautifully done.

29:48.851 --> 29:50.679
Caviar, big no-no.

29:50.723 --> 29:52.333
When you've got that heat,
the last thing you want to go

29:52.377 --> 29:53.769
is that salty,
expensive caviar.

29:53.813 --> 29:55.510
Okay, Chef.

29:55.554 --> 29:57.425
But that squid ink
in that tortilla?

29:57.469 --> 30:00.689
Love the flavor,
that saltiness from the sea.

30:00.733 --> 30:02.125
Absolutely incredible.

30:02.169 --> 30:03.475
And you've taken it
down a route

30:03.518 --> 30:05.346
that very few
Mexican chefs would.

30:05.390 --> 30:06.956
- Great job.
- Thank you.

30:08.393 --> 30:11.265
- Good job, Ces.
- Thank you.

30:12.397 --> 30:14.050
Next up, Gerron.

30:21.841 --> 30:23.190
Thank you.

30:24.626 --> 30:26.585
You have a Nashville
hot quail

30:26.628 --> 30:30.153
with a fingerling potato salad
and poached quail eggs.

30:30.197 --> 30:32.634
The dish is beautiful.
It shows your journey.

30:32.678 --> 30:35.985
Gerron:
You know, my inspiration
for tonight is family.

30:36.029 --> 30:38.727
The frying technique
is something that
my mom taught me,

30:38.771 --> 30:42.644
but I wanted to find
a way to elevate that
to restaurant quality.

30:42.688 --> 30:45.560
Joe:
Gerron, I'm gonna take
a bite of that quail.

30:45.604 --> 30:48.084
It needs to be moist,
it needs to be spicy,

30:48.128 --> 30:49.521
it needs to be crispy.

30:49.564 --> 30:51.523
If all that happens
on my palate,

30:51.566 --> 30:53.786
you have a dish
that could win.

31:05.711 --> 31:08.975
Gerron, I've never
tasted anything

31:09.018 --> 31:10.455
quite like that before.

31:18.898 --> 31:21.683
Gerron, I've never
tasted anything

31:21.727 --> 31:23.032
quite like that before.

31:25.861 --> 31:27.385
This is kind of like...

31:30.518 --> 31:32.607
perfection.

31:32.651 --> 31:35.697
The quail meat is flavorful.

31:35.741 --> 31:38.004
The batter is well-seasoned.

31:38.047 --> 31:42.704
The spiciness of the Nashville
hot sauce is spot-on. Perfect.

31:42.748 --> 31:44.576
And there's so many
different things

31:44.619 --> 31:46.578
going on on this dish,

31:46.621 --> 31:48.449
and they're all really
well done.

31:48.493 --> 31:52.061
My criticism would be perhaps
it lacks the cohesiveness

31:52.105 --> 31:54.803
of one conceptualized
appetizer.

31:54.847 --> 31:57.632
If you go down south and
you have Nashville hot chicken,

31:57.676 --> 32:00.853
your options are a coleslaw
or a potato salad.

32:00.896 --> 32:03.159
That's exactly what
I wanted to provide you guys,

32:03.203 --> 32:06.598
- a taste of me on a plate.
- You know, Gerron,
I appreciate that,

32:06.641 --> 32:08.730
and you are so bound
to that tradition

32:08.774 --> 32:11.733
that it's been great,
and it's got you to here.

32:11.777 --> 32:14.170
But now, not everything
has to be a strict reference

32:14.214 --> 32:15.955
to where
you come from anymore.

32:15.998 --> 32:19.045
- It's time for you to fly.
- I disagree with you, Joe.

32:19.088 --> 32:22.396
I think this is exactly what
"MasterChef" is intended to do:

32:22.440 --> 32:24.180
to bring out the best in you

32:24.224 --> 32:26.835
with us helping you
with technique.

32:26.879 --> 32:29.621
So this says so much
about your evolution.

32:29.664 --> 32:32.667
I think frying is the lost art
in the kitchen,

32:32.711 --> 32:34.626
and it's a true art,
and I think you've done that.

32:34.669 --> 32:37.411
- Fantastic job.
- Thank you, Chef.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.717
Gerron, I think
you've done a great job.

32:38.760 --> 32:39.848
Quail's slightly gamy.

32:39.892 --> 32:41.284
The coating, delicious.

32:41.328 --> 32:43.504
You've elevated
a fast food,

32:43.548 --> 32:46.551
and you paid respect
to your upbringing.

32:46.594 --> 32:48.378
I love the dish.
Good job.

32:48.422 --> 32:49.902
Thank you.

32:49.945 --> 32:51.730
- Good job.
- Thank you.

32:51.773 --> 32:53.645
- Good job, G.
- Thank you.

32:53.688 --> 32:55.908
So, guys,
an amazing start.

32:55.951 --> 32:57.562
Please, head back
to the kitchen.

32:57.605 --> 32:58.998
Entrées are up next.

33:01.653 --> 33:05.221
[ cheers and applause ]

33:10.836 --> 33:11.750
Wow. Come on,
what an amazing start.

33:11.793 --> 33:14.361
Three stunning appetizers.

33:14.404 --> 33:17.146
- Whose appetizer had the edge?
- Cesar's plate had it for me.

33:17.190 --> 33:20.585
He took the most risks and
it paid the biggest dividends.

33:20.628 --> 33:21.673
I agree. I think that's
one of his best dishes
he's ever cooked.

33:21.716 --> 33:23.152
Aarón:
It pains me to say this,

33:23.196 --> 33:25.372
but I think Gerron
had the dish for me.

33:25.415 --> 33:28.897
Gerron was so masterful
with frying that quail.

33:28.941 --> 33:31.944
But I feel that he was
just always in his box,

33:31.987 --> 33:35.251
and the finale would
be the perfect moment
for him to take off.

33:35.295 --> 33:38.646
Now, Ashley, she may have
fell short on the appetizers,

33:38.690 --> 33:41.649
but this is a marathon,
and it's not all on one course.

33:41.693 --> 33:45.740
Two more courses to go.
Let's go get our entrées.

33:51.311 --> 33:53.269
Yeah!

33:56.664 --> 33:58.971
Aarón:
All three of you did
an incredible job,

33:59.014 --> 34:02.496
but that was just
the first course.

34:02.540 --> 34:05.543
It is time for your entrées!

34:07.806 --> 34:09.851
Are you three ready?

34:09.895 --> 34:11.897
- Yes, Chef.
- Yes, Chef!

34:14.682 --> 34:17.990
Your 60 minutes starts now.

34:18.033 --> 34:21.471
- Let's go.
- [ clock beeping ]

34:21.515 --> 34:24.736
[ crowd cheering ]

34:24.779 --> 34:26.694
- Gordon:
Right, this is it. Come on.
- Joe: Amazing.

34:26.738 --> 34:27.826
Gordon:
Three of the best appetizers
we've ever seen

34:27.869 --> 34:29.479
in the history
of this competition.

34:29.523 --> 34:31.612
Now we gotta follow suit
with incredible entrées.

34:31.656 --> 34:34.876
- Come on, Gerron!
- Let's go! Whoo!

34:34.920 --> 34:36.530
I'm really interested to see,
not only the dishes,

34:36.574 --> 34:38.314
but the progression
of the menu at this point.

34:38.358 --> 34:40.055
- Gordon: Sure.
- You don't want to make
lateral movements.

34:40.099 --> 34:42.667
Each course,
take it up another level.

34:42.710 --> 34:44.538
Let's do it, Ashley!

34:44.582 --> 34:48.107
For my entrée, I'm making
a pan-seared guinea hen breast,

34:48.150 --> 34:50.196
black-eyed peas,
and collard green ragout

34:50.239 --> 34:53.286
- with a quince cognac sauce.
- Let's go, babe.

34:53.329 --> 34:57.638
I really am focusing
on using every part
of the guinea hen.

34:57.682 --> 35:00.206
I have some ground to make up
in this entrée round,

35:00.249 --> 35:02.774
but what I'm doing is a whole
other level of difficult.

35:02.817 --> 35:06.516
So if I pull this off,
I'm right back in this game.

35:06.560 --> 35:08.780
- Oven open.
- Samantha: Smells good!

35:08.823 --> 35:10.782
Let's go, Cesar!

35:10.825 --> 35:13.219
For my entrée, I'm making
pan-seared duck breast,

35:13.262 --> 35:16.875
charcoal grilled vegetables,
and an almond mole.

35:16.918 --> 35:18.659
Besides getting the temperature
correct on the duck,

35:18.703 --> 35:20.139
to try to accomplish
mole in 60 minutes

35:20.182 --> 35:22.663
is gonna be ludicrous.

35:22.707 --> 35:26.536
Done correctly,
it's a beautiful texture
and flavor profile.

35:26.580 --> 35:29.801
- Look at what Cesar's doing.
- A mole normally takes all day!

35:29.844 --> 35:31.367
- Gordon: Yeah.
- Joe: In one hour--
too ambitious.

35:31.411 --> 35:32.673
The thing that could go wrong

35:32.717 --> 35:33.892
is that it's not enough time

35:33.935 --> 35:36.677
to fully develop
all the components.

35:36.721 --> 35:39.027
But I'm doing something
completely different,

35:39.071 --> 35:40.594
and I hope
that bodes well for me.

35:40.638 --> 35:43.031
[ speaking Spanish ]

35:43.075 --> 35:45.686
Gerron is cruising!
I love it!

35:45.730 --> 35:48.776
I am making Carabinero prawns
with heirloom grits,

35:48.820 --> 35:50.691
shellfish jus,
and crispy shallots.

35:50.735 --> 35:53.694
So, pretty much
a shrimp and grits.

35:53.738 --> 35:55.696
Mmm. Perfect.

35:55.740 --> 35:57.742
That was one of my mom's
absolute favorite dishes.

35:57.785 --> 36:01.136
What I'm doing tonight
is in memory of her.

36:01.180 --> 36:03.922
Gordon:
45 minutes to go, guys.
Come on.

36:03.965 --> 36:06.054
- Stay focused, Gerron.
- Whoo!

36:06.098 --> 36:08.927
Young man, question.
How does it feel
to be mentored

36:08.970 --> 36:10.972
by one of
the best restaurateurs
anywhere on the planet?

36:11.016 --> 36:14.976
- You know what?
Everybody knows I love Joe.
- We don't, by the way.

36:15.020 --> 36:16.848
- Okay? We don't.
- So that makes one of us.

36:16.891 --> 36:19.720
But you both have
one big thing in common.

36:19.764 --> 36:21.374
Joe's mum was
a massive influence on him.

36:21.417 --> 36:23.724
Your mum was a huge
influence on you.

36:23.768 --> 36:25.944
Always. You know,
when my mom passed away,

36:25.987 --> 36:27.597
in the last supper
that I had with her,

36:27.641 --> 36:29.164
she ordered
shrimp and grits.

36:29.208 --> 36:31.384
And so, you know,
it's only right for me

36:31.427 --> 36:33.734
to elevate
a shrimp and grits dish.

36:33.778 --> 36:35.780
I live in the South,
so I know it.

36:35.823 --> 36:37.825
How are you gonna elevate
to make it something beautiful?

36:37.869 --> 36:40.175
You know what, Chef?
My presentation
has been something

36:40.219 --> 36:41.873
that I've worked on constantly
in this competition.

36:41.916 --> 36:44.614
And so I'm ready to show
you guys how much I've grown,

36:44.658 --> 36:49.445
and how much flavor
I can put into a shrimp
and grits in such little time.

36:49.489 --> 36:51.230
- All right.
- Good luck, young man.
You got this, come on.

36:51.273 --> 36:53.536
- Well done.
- Come on, Gerron!

36:53.580 --> 36:55.974
- All right, Ash.
- Yeah!

36:56.017 --> 36:58.628
- Go, Ashley!
- All right, so, Ashley,

36:58.672 --> 37:00.979
you know, you having arguably
the best chef in the world

37:01.022 --> 37:02.850
- Yes.
- mentor you,
that's a huge honor.

37:02.894 --> 37:04.765
- Of course!
- How has he guided you

37:04.809 --> 37:07.855
- through this
whole competition?
- He makes me fearless.

37:07.899 --> 37:09.770
I feel like
I've tried so many new things
because of him,

37:09.814 --> 37:11.859
and guinea hen,
I've never done before.

37:11.903 --> 37:13.992
But I'm using every part--

37:14.035 --> 37:15.776
the heart to the thigh
to the breast,

37:15.820 --> 37:18.213
and my collard greens
are cooking down.
I'm going for it.

37:18.257 --> 37:20.259
Joe: You picked
one of the leanest

37:20.302 --> 37:22.217
and most difficult
birds to cook.

37:22.261 --> 37:24.045
- That guinea hen,
when I cut it open,
- Yes, Chef.

37:24.089 --> 37:25.655
and I see a red blood line?
It's undercooked.

37:25.699 --> 37:27.266
If I cut the center of it,

37:27.309 --> 37:29.442
and it's mealy, grainy,
and dry, it's overcooked.

37:29.485 --> 37:32.053
You are walking on
a very, very high wire.

37:32.097 --> 37:34.490
- Aarón: Yep.
- High wire. Highest, baby.
Highest!

37:34.534 --> 37:35.883
- Joe: Good luck.
- Ashley: Thank you.

37:35.927 --> 37:37.493
- [ cheering ]
- [ clock beeping ]

37:37.537 --> 37:40.453
25 minutes remaining.

37:40.496 --> 37:42.498
- Whoo! Cesar!
- Come on, Cesar!

37:42.542 --> 37:44.936
You got this!
You got this!

37:44.979 --> 37:47.068
- Right, young man.
- Yes, Chef.

37:47.112 --> 37:48.678
Give me an insight to the dish.
What are you cooking?

37:48.722 --> 37:50.811
Cesar:
I'm making a pan-seared
duck breast,

37:50.855 --> 37:53.814
charcoal roasted vegetables,
and an almond mole.

37:53.858 --> 37:56.948
- Gordon: Wow.
- He's crazy. Loco.

37:56.991 --> 37:59.037
You have a recipe
for a 60-minute mole?

37:59.080 --> 38:01.039
- Cesar: Working on it.
- Joe: How do you do
a mole in an hour?

38:01.082 --> 38:02.605
- We're-- we're baffled.
- I couldn't go

38:02.649 --> 38:04.085
with the traditional mole
from Puebla,

38:04.129 --> 38:05.913
so I had to pick
a different mole

38:05.957 --> 38:07.045
based on guajillo peppers
and almonds.

38:07.088 --> 38:08.829
Gordon:
You have a mentor

38:08.873 --> 38:10.831
who's one of the best Mexican
chefs anywhere the planet.

38:10.875 --> 38:12.920
He knows you can't fast-track
a mole in 60 minutes.

38:12.964 --> 38:14.704
What are you doing?

38:14.748 --> 38:16.228
I chose mole for my entrée

38:16.271 --> 38:18.099
because doing something
this difficult

38:18.143 --> 38:20.841
is one way to prove
that I'm worthy

38:20.885 --> 38:22.495
of the title of
America's next MasterChef.

38:22.538 --> 38:24.497
Gordon:
There's chefs in Mexico

38:24.540 --> 38:25.933
- that spend a year
making a mole.
- I know.

38:25.977 --> 38:28.501
You're doing it
in 60 freaking minutes.

38:28.544 --> 38:31.025
I knew going into it
it was a gamble, and, I mean,

38:31.069 --> 38:32.940
right now I'm feeling
like I might've made a mistake.

38:32.984 --> 38:35.900
60-minute mole.
It better be freaking good.

38:42.384 --> 38:45.518
Cesar, there's chefs
in Mexico that spend a year
making a mole.

38:45.561 --> 38:47.868
- I know.
- You're doing it
in 60 freaking minutes.

38:47.912 --> 38:50.740
Cesar:
60 minutes. It's ambitious,
but if I want this title,

38:50.784 --> 38:54.048
- those are the kind of moves
that I have to make, Chef.
- Mama, what is he doing?

38:54.092 --> 38:56.442
[ speaking Spanish ]

38:56.485 --> 38:58.879
- That's how good he is.
- You can do it.

38:58.923 --> 39:01.099
Hearing my mom and my sisters
cry out from the balcony

39:01.142 --> 39:04.015
reminds me of why
I chose mole to begin with.

39:04.058 --> 39:06.539
- [ cheering ]
- [ speaking Spanish ]

39:06.582 --> 39:08.541
I'm here to make
my family proud

39:08.584 --> 39:11.457
and make myself proud,
and showcase dishes

39:11.500 --> 39:13.459
that represent me
and my upbringing,

39:13.502 --> 39:15.504
- and my roots and my home.
- Good luck, Cesar.

39:15.548 --> 39:16.897
- It sounds amazing.
- Thank you. Thank you, guys.

39:16.941 --> 39:17.985
- Good luck.
- You got it!

39:18.029 --> 39:20.466
Let's go, Gerron!

39:20.509 --> 39:22.903
- Let's go, babe.
- Let's go, girlie!

39:22.947 --> 39:25.123
Gordon:
We are down
to the last ten minutes.

39:25.166 --> 39:27.342
- Let's go!
- Shanika: Y'all got this!

39:27.386 --> 39:28.778
Joe:
There's at lot at stake here.

39:28.822 --> 39:30.911
Three really
ambitious entrées.

39:30.955 --> 39:33.522
Gerron is doing
basically elevated
shrimp and grits, right?

39:33.566 --> 39:36.961
- Ralph: Dude,
those prawns look amazing.
- The color's gorgeous.

39:37.004 --> 39:38.484
My big question
about Gerron's entrée

39:38.527 --> 39:39.920
- is can you elevate it?
- Aarón: Yup.

39:39.964 --> 39:40.921
Gordon:
Very few chefs in this country

39:40.965 --> 39:43.358
have taken that
to the premiere league.

39:43.402 --> 39:46.013
But, come on,
the last meal with his mum,
the dish that she ordered,

39:46.057 --> 39:48.189
he's replicating that dish
out of respect for her.

39:48.233 --> 39:49.756
Aarón:
Talk about somebody that's
working with lots of heart.

39:49.799 --> 39:51.932
So, Ashley's making
a pan-seared guinea hen,

39:51.976 --> 39:53.803
and that's gonna be sat
on a puree of black-eyed peas

39:53.847 --> 39:55.936
with those incredible
collard greens.

39:55.980 --> 39:58.721
So she's bringing
that French influence
into the deep South.

39:58.765 --> 40:01.159
- Yeah.
- But guinea hen
are wild birds.

40:01.202 --> 40:03.161
It's a little bit gamy,
a little richer, less fat.

40:03.204 --> 40:05.076
So, difficult protein to cook.

40:05.119 --> 40:08.383
Come on, Cesar!
That manic mailman speed.

40:08.427 --> 40:11.343
Gordon:
My big worry tonight with
the entrées has to be Cesar.

40:11.386 --> 40:13.562
I don't know if
that rich, gamy duck breast

40:13.606 --> 40:15.173
can be cooked perfectly

40:15.216 --> 40:17.784
with a mole that can be done
in 60 minutes.

40:17.827 --> 40:19.568
Maria:
Amazing!

40:19.612 --> 40:21.396
I believe in him.
If there's one guy

40:21.440 --> 40:23.094
that moves fast enough
to get a mole done,

40:23.137 --> 40:25.400
it's that crazy locoman
right there.

40:25.444 --> 40:28.316
And that mole right now,
from here, has the right color.

40:28.360 --> 40:30.057
I like the consistency.
It looks great.

40:30.101 --> 40:32.364
- That looks amazing!
- Amazing!

40:32.407 --> 40:33.626
You fly, mijo!

40:33.669 --> 40:36.063
Five and a half minutes to go.

40:36.107 --> 40:39.327
- Let's go, Gerron!
- Ooh, it looks so good.

40:39.371 --> 40:41.634
Whoo! Go, Ash!

40:41.677 --> 40:44.115
- Yes!
- Looks good, Ash.

40:46.247 --> 40:49.250
I'm smelling a burning smell

40:49.294 --> 40:50.425
and I'm not sure
where it's coming from.

40:51.470 --> 40:52.514
[ groans ]

40:54.212 --> 40:55.648
I peek into
my collard greens,

40:55.691 --> 40:58.129
and they are burnt.

40:59.434 --> 41:01.001
I'm having a panic attack.

41:01.045 --> 41:03.438
I can't have any mistakes
on the plate

41:03.482 --> 41:05.049
like I did
in my appetizer round.

41:05.092 --> 41:08.356
We're down to four minutes
to go, guys.

41:08.400 --> 41:10.228
Ashley might
be a little behind.

41:10.271 --> 41:12.839
- Is she redoing them?
- I think so.
It looks like it.

41:12.882 --> 41:14.275
- Come on. Come on, come on.
- Gordon: She's cooking
collard greens twice.

41:14.319 --> 41:16.147
- Oh, my Lord.
- Come on, Ashley, let's go.

41:16.190 --> 41:17.713
- You can do it.
- Bowen: She's crazy.

41:17.757 --> 41:19.628
Shanika:
That's Ashley for you.

41:19.672 --> 41:21.456
- Oh, my God.
- Gordon: Three minutes to go.

41:21.500 --> 41:24.155
- Whoo!
- This is it, guys.
Start plating, come on.

41:24.198 --> 41:26.157
Gerron:
Plating. Come on, baby.

41:26.200 --> 41:28.681
- Here we go.
- Ash, you gotta
start plating, darling.

41:28.724 --> 41:30.509
- Ashley, come on, girl.
- Oh, my gosh.

41:30.552 --> 41:32.250
Coming!
I'm coming, I'm coming.

41:32.293 --> 41:35.905
Girl, what are you doing?
We don't have time for this.

41:35.949 --> 41:38.299
Forget about the greens.
Start plating.

41:38.343 --> 41:41.041
Guys, I don't think Ashley's
gonna make it.

41:41.085 --> 41:44.523
Minutes to go, and she hasn't
even finished cooking.

41:46.133 --> 41:48.092
- Narrator: Next time...
- Gordon: This is it.

41:48.135 --> 41:50.268
the world's biggest cooking
competition continues...

41:50.311 --> 41:52.705
- Come on, Cesar!
- Come on, baby!

41:52.748 --> 41:54.707
as the three best
home cooks in America...

41:54.750 --> 41:57.710
You got it, Gerron! Let's go!

41:57.753 --> 41:59.929
- battle it out...
- Go, Ashley!

41:59.973 --> 42:02.758
- You got it, girl!
- ...over the final two courses.

42:02.802 --> 42:04.456
Come on!

42:04.499 --> 42:06.197
- Only one...
- It's exceptional.

42:06.240 --> 42:07.720
- will walk away...
- I love it.

42:07.763 --> 42:09.287
with a quarter
of a million dollars...

42:09.330 --> 42:11.071
My God. Perfection.

42:11.115 --> 42:13.943
...and the MasterChef title.

42:13.987 --> 42:16.120
The winner is...
