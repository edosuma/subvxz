<i>There are two kinds of folks who sit
around thinking about how to kill people—</i>

00:03.000 --> 00:05.060
<i>psychopaths and mystery writers.</i>

00:05.100 --> 00:08.160
<i>I'm the kind that pays better.
Who am I? I'm Rick Castle.</i>

00:08.200 --> 00:09.300
Castle.
Castle.

00:09.300 --> 00:12.960
I really am ruggedly handsome, aren't I?
<i>Every writer needs inspiration.</i>

00:13.000 --> 00:14.960
<i>And I've found mine.</i>
–Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.000 --> 00:15.760
Beckett.
Beckett.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.760
–Nikki Heat?
–The character he's basing on you.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.560
<i>And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,</i>

00:19.600 --> 00:22.360
<i>I get to be on her case.</i>
I would be happy to let you spank me.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.260
<i>And together, we catch killers.</i>

00:24.300 --> 00:25.560
We make a pretty good team,

00:25.600 --> 00:27.260
like Starsky and Hutch,
Turner and Hooch.

00:27.300 --> 00:29.610
You do remind me
a little of Hooch.

00:52.300 --> 00:54.200
Aah! Off with your heads!

00:54.200 --> 00:55.100
Oh!

01:00.100 --> 01:01.300
Aah!

01:02.100 --> 01:05.994
What is it about full moons
that bring out all the crazies?

01:06.100 --> 01:07.460
I don't know.
You tell me.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.600
Aah! Oh!

01:13.200 --> 01:16.360
–Hey, Karpowski. How's it going?
–Same old, same old. You, Beckett?

01:16.400 --> 01:18.314
–Ah, I can't complain.
–Good.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.660
You guys should really sell tickets.
I mean, you got everything—

01:25.700 --> 01:27.400
madness, mayhem.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.220
Now all you need is—

01:32.500 --> 01:33.300
Beckett.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.700
Ashley Cosway, 32,

01:39.700 --> 01:41.000
couples therapist.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.960
Husband found her just before midnight.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.760
He was picking her up on his way home
after the st. John's game at the garden.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
Any witnesses?

01:46.800 --> 01:49.460
None so far, but I did find a
receipt for this takeout right here.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.820
Hmm. Dinner for two.

01:50.900 --> 01:53.260
Yeah, it's from Szechuan Wok over on 9th.

01:53.300 --> 01:56.060
Receipt doesn't match any of
the cards in the vic's wallet.

01:56.100 --> 01:58.660
–Husband recognize the number?
–Mnh-mnh.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.760
–When was it charged?
–6:02 p.m

02:00.800 --> 02:02.260
Lanie puts the time
of death around 8:00.

02:02.300 --> 02:05.160
Well, whoever she had dinner with,
may be the last person to see her alive.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.301
Or the first one to see
her dead. Run the card.

02:09.900 --> 02:13.360
You know, if this was one of those
super scientific forensic shows,

02:13.400 --> 02:16.360
they'd stick some electrodes
in these fishes' brains,

02:16.400 --> 02:19.106
get a fish-eye view
of whatever they saw.

02:23.300 --> 02:26.760
Dr Parish, when'd they change
the dress code downtown?

02:26.800 --> 02:30.560
Well, unlike you, I don't sit around work
all night waiting for the next vic to show.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.844
Quit looking at the girls, Castle.

02:33.000 --> 02:33.900
Roger that.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.260
Multiple G.S.W.S entries
look fairly small caliber.

02:37.300 --> 02:38.600
Probably a .22.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.500
“Psycho the rapist,
your out of time”?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.860
It looks like a patient
lost their patience.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.748
Also his command of grammar.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.772
“Your” should be
you'r-e, as in “you are.”

02:51.100 --> 02:54.160
That's not even a tough one, not
like when to use “who” or ”whom”?

02:54.200 --> 02:56.460
Do you really think that's
the takeaway here, Castle?

02:56.500 --> 03:01.060
I'm just saying, whoever killed her,
also murdered the English language.

03:01.100 --> 03:02.460
Any signs of struggle?

03:02.500 --> 03:05.260
–Bruises on both arms.
–Check for fibers and hair.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.160
See if our killer left anything behind.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.100
Okay.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.400
–Castle!
–Mm-hmm.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.700
Uh, no. She, uh, she never
discussed her patients.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.260
Ash was, uh, was
very professional that way.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.960
What was she doing here so late?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.460
Uh, she always would have
a couple nights a month

03:23.500 --> 03:26.404
where she'd work late
writing up case notes.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.660
I'd use that as a time to go out with
the boys and have a boys' night,

03:28.700 --> 03:30.060
And when I'd get back,
I'd walk her home.

03:30.100 --> 03:31.760
Did you know who
she was having dinner with?

03:31.800 --> 03:34.560
No. I mean, unless someone
called her after we spoke.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.460
When was that?

03:35.500 --> 03:37.060
It was before I left work.
6:00-ish.

03:37.100 --> 03:39.360
I was, uh, I was heading out
to the game.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.660
What did you talk about?

03:40.700 --> 03:43.010
Just a meaningless check-in.
And I…

03:43.300 --> 03:46.402
right now I remember
I didn't say “I love you.”

03:49.700 --> 03:50.960
Thank you, Mr Cosway.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Yeah.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.360
We got another.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.200
Pop and drop on 102nd.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.360
Full moon strikes again.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.760
All right, you guys go on uptown,
and I'll finish up here.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.562
So much for my famous warm
honey milk with Jenny tonight.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.712
Did I say that out loud?
–Yeah.

04:08.800 --> 04:12.460
Her husband calls before 6:00,
And the food's picked up at 6:02.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.660
She knew who she was
having dinner with.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.812
–Someone with bad grammar.
–Hmm.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Hey, uh, a warm milk
nightcap with your lady?

04:21.500 --> 04:23.660
That is sad, bro.
–It helps her sleep.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.360
How about the sound of your voice?

04:25.400 --> 04:27.700
It doesn't…? Works on me.

04:27.800 --> 04:28.860
How you doing, Dr Perlmutter?

04:28.900 --> 04:31.900
Shh. The body is speaking.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.222
What's it saying?

04:34.400 --> 04:36.446
It's saying, “someone shot me.”

04:36.500 --> 04:39.500
One to the midsection.
.38, maybe even a .45.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.338
He was shot at close
range and from behind.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.260
–That's cold.
–Yeah, well, that's the living for you.

04:45.300 --> 04:47.560
–He have any ID?
–No, wallet's gone.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.200
No watch, no jewelry.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.260
Maybe a mugging gone bad.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.660
A looky loo said she recognized
him from the neighborhood.

04:52.700 --> 04:56.300
Gave his info to officer
Whojamiface over there.

04:56.700 --> 04:57.800
Whojamiface?

04:58.800 --> 05:03.816
Nice to see you making an effort to bond
with the rank and file, Perlmutter.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.360
It's not like you're
just leaving yourself a note,

05:09.400 --> 05:11.974
You know, to buy bread
on the way home.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.960
You're writing on a person
you just murdered.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.860
You're trying to make a point—

05:16.900 --> 05:18.860
a point you care a
great deal about presumably,

05:18.900 --> 05:20.260
because you just killed
someone to make it.

05:20.300 --> 05:24.560
So how do you not make sure that you're
using the proper language to make that point?

05:24.600 --> 05:28.600
Frank Anderson, retired middle-school
math teacher, I.S 161.

05:28.700 --> 05:29.492
You want in?

05:29.600 --> 05:31.400
Uh, no, thanks. Full up.

05:38.000 --> 05:38.600
So…

05:39.900 --> 05:41.484
How'd you find the body?

05:42.600 --> 05:43.700
On the ground.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.860
Was he positioned in a creepy way?

05:45.900 --> 05:48.200
Yeah, like a guy who was shot.

05:48.900 --> 05:49.800
Oh.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.700
So just your garden-variety
homicide/robbery, huh?

05:54.700 --> 05:55.600
Actually…

05:56.200 --> 05:58.060
Pop and drops are some of
the hardest cases to close.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.560
Randomness of the victim,
anonymous nature of the crime—

06:00.600 --> 06:03.160
It takes some real
serious detective work.

06:03.200 --> 06:07.160
Okay. Well, if you guys want any help,
you know where to find me.

06:07.200 --> 06:07.900
Help?

06:09.400 --> 06:10.984
Did you just say “help”?

06:11.200 --> 06:12.460
Don't worry about us, Castle.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.560
We'll probably close ours
before your therapist.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.200
Really?

06:15.200 --> 06:15.800
Mm-hmm.

06:15.800 --> 06:19.232
Well, perhaps you'd like
to make things interesting.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.600
Whoa. Wait.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.460
Are you saying you want to wager
on who solves their case first?

06:25.500 --> 06:27.100
That's sick, bro.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.460
–50 bucks?
–We win, you pay us both.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.200
Deal.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.660
Not a word to Beckett, okay?

06:37.700 --> 06:40.472
She finds out about this,
she'll shoot us.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.014
Secrets, murder and gambling—

06:43.300 --> 06:45.280
Three of my favorite pastimes.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.400
May the best man win.

06:47.700 --> 06:48.500
May he.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.360
Richard, that's appalling—
wagering on death.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.860
They're already dead, mother.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.360
And who's to say that
catching killers cannot be fun?

07:00.400 --> 07:02.060
Hey, dad,
are you working tonight?

07:02.100 --> 07:03.200
Maybe. Why?

07:03.400 --> 07:05.260
Oh, I just have math club till 6:00,

07:05.300 --> 07:08.960
and then I wanted to take Owen out for
a birthday banana split at serendipity.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.960
I just wanted to do something special because
things have been a little rocky with us lately.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.574
Nothing smoothes rocky like rocky road.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.860
Just remember, it's a school
night. Be home by midnight.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.616
Dad, I'll be home by 9:00.

07:20.700 --> 07:21.860
–Love you.
–Love you.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.160
–Yeah, bye, darling.
–Love you. Bye, guys.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.960
Ah, young love— first banana
splits, then splitting assets.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.760
Ah, mother. You are a hopeless romantic.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.800
I know.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.000
–Mm.
–Mm.

07:32.700 --> 07:36.396
–Oops. I'm off to an audition.
–And I have a bet to win.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.560
Yes, detective.
That's my credit card.

07:40.600 --> 07:43.460
I had dinner with her last
night. She's my best friend.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.660
When I left her there,
she was alive.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.460
–What time did you leave, Ms Rossi?
–Around 7:00.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.760
–Then where did you go?
–To drinks with other associates from my firm.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.060
I was at the Gansevoort bar
until 11:00.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.360
Did you make plans to
have dinner together,

07:54.400 --> 07:55.760
or did you just show up?

07:55.800 --> 07:59.100
She called me.
She said she wanted to talk.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.080
But I-I didn't—
I didn't know.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.460
You didn't know what?

08:05.500 --> 08:07.700
I should have said something.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.260
I should've done something,
you know? I—

08:10.300 --> 08:11.560
Why did she call, Ms Rossi?

08:11.600 --> 08:15.000
She needed my advice
as a lawyer.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.060
Something happened last Friday,
something bad.

08:18.100 --> 08:18.700
What?

08:18.700 --> 08:22.396
She wouldn't say, but I knew
it was one of her patients.

08:23.300 --> 08:26.560
She wanted to know how to get
a restraining order.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.400
–Against who?
–Whom.

08:28.900 --> 08:30.100
She wouldn't say.

08:30.700 --> 08:31.500
God.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.059
I should have stayed with her.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.607
I shouldn't have let her off the hook.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.059
Looks like Ashley
took her oath seriously.

08:42.100 --> 08:45.060
Her husband had no idea that
something bad happened on Friday.

08:45.100 --> 08:50.116
Doctor/patient privilege is supposed
to protect people, not get them killed.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.000
Hey.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.760
So the vic's girlfriend?
Alibi is good.

08:53.800 --> 08:57.060
Coworkers confirm that she arrived
for drinks at 7:15, left at 11:00.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.860
The husband's buddy places him at
the garden from 7:00 till about 10:00.

08:59.900 --> 09:02.474
Which leaves us with Friday's patients.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.460
I sure would like a peek
at Dr Cosway's notes.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.860
Not without a warrant.
* running the names.

09:06.900 --> 09:09.760
If he threatened and then killed her,
he's probably got violent priors.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.960
Once again, Mr And Mrs Marx,
I'm very sorry for your loss.

09:13.000 --> 09:13.900
Thank you.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.074

09:25.100 --> 09:26.760
And a dark cloud descends.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.242
–Any hot leads?
–Matter of fact, yes.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.860
Turns out our victim went
for a walk every night.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.760
And guess who hangs in the park
right where our victim was popped.

09:34.800 --> 09:39.100
–Recently fired postal workers.
–No, gang kids. Very rough guys.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.060
Do they hang out there regularly?

09:42.100 --> 09:44.560
–That's right.
–Then they didn't do it.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.260
If they're known to hang out there, then
they're gonna know they're gonna get caught.

09:47.300 --> 09:49.660
If they're gonna do something,
they're gonna do it somewhere else.

09:49.700 --> 09:51.560
I know what you're doing, Castle.
You're trying to mess with our confidence.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.260
If I was trying to mess with your confidence,
I would tell you that our victim

09:54.300 --> 09:58.860
talked to her lawyer friend on the night
she was murdered about a restraining order.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.060
And do you have a suspect?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.160
We're narrowing it down.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.560
But doesn't that have
a lovely ring to it?

10:03.600 --> 10:05.600
Restraining order.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.700
–Hey.
–Hey.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.000
I was just…
um, they were…

10:17.700 --> 10:18.660
There was two…
–Yeah.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.152
Beckett, we got a hit.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.200
Hal Ross?

10:23.200 --> 10:25.160
Multiple assault charges
over the last ten years.

10:25.200 --> 10:28.368
He and his wife were
Dr Cosway's 2:00 on Friday.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.860
–What are you doing?
–Hey. Hey, hey! Hey! Hey!

10:39.900 --> 10:43.200
Castle, not cool.
Stairs. Go, go, go.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.388
Why'd you do that?

10:45.500 --> 10:46.400
Do what?

10:55.500 --> 10:57.678
All right,
I'm just gonna say it—

10:58.000 --> 10:59.254
I've got a feeling.

10:59.300 --> 11:02.500
Doesn't happen often,
but I am feelin' it.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.056
This is our guy.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.700
Mr Ross?

11:10.100 --> 11:12.740
What's up, garbage on my sidewalk again?

11:14.100 --> 11:17.000
Uh… would you mind putting that down?

11:21.600 --> 11:24.702
Where were you last night
between the hours of…

11:24.800 --> 11:26.120
When was that again?

11:26.500 --> 11:27.560
What are you talking about?

11:27.600 --> 11:29.976
Are you familiar with Ashley Cosway?

11:30.100 --> 11:31.560
Oh, yeah, sure. The doc.

11:31.600 --> 11:34.960
–Well, she was murdered last night.
–What? The doc's dead?

11:35.000 --> 11:38.760
Can you confirm your whereabouts
between 7:30 and 9:00 last night?

11:38.800 --> 11:40.760
Yeah, sure. I was here. I'm open
till 10:00 every night.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.460
–Can anyone corroborate that?
–My employees.

11:43.500 --> 11:46.960
Well, how convenient that
your alibis are on your payroll.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.660
What would make you think
that I killed the doc?

11:48.700 --> 11:52.600
Mr Ross, you have a history
of violence—assault, battery.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.108
Okay, well, why do
you think I was in…

11:55.800 --> 11:56.900
therapy?

11:58.100 --> 12:02.100
Okay, Doc Cosway showed me
that I was only hurting myself.

12:02.100 --> 12:04.460
Come on. Hal, we know something
bad happened last Friday.

12:04.500 --> 12:05.400
Come on.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.960
Something happened, all right,
but it wasn't in my session.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.460
Unh-unh. You want to talk
to somebody?

12:09.500 --> 12:12.760
–You try the appointment before mine.
–Why is that?

12:12.800 --> 12:15.260
Judy and I, we are in the little
waiting room before our session.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.360
We hear all this yelling.
–About what?

12:17.400 --> 12:21.060
I don't know, but this guy was
cursing Doc Cosway out big-time.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.460
And it was kind of scary.
I was tempted to go in there,

12:23.500 --> 12:24.760
but then we heard the guy leave.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.760
Did you get a good look
at his face?

12:25.800 --> 12:28.460
No, no, no. He went out
the hallway door. Doc got us.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.668
She was rattled, but she
did our session anyway.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.410
I got a feeling this isn't our guy.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.900
Hinkle. Evan Hinkle.

12:37.900 --> 12:39.660
He's had the appointment
before the Rosses

12:39.700 --> 12:41.860
every week for
the last two years.

12:41.900 --> 12:44.060
The guy is clean.
There's no record of anything.

12:44.100 --> 12:47.460
Two straight years of therapy
Maybe he just snapped.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.282
Have uniforms bring him in.

12:49.700 --> 12:51.416
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.044
Esposito tipped me off to the bet.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.374
Thought I'd toss a little towards ours.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.360
Toss away, my friend.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.096
And spread the word around
if anyone else wants a taste.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.308
Let's go. Come on, big fella. Come on.

13:13.800 --> 13:17.600
To the left, over here. Take a seat.

13:19.300 --> 13:21.860
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:21.900 --> 13:24.360
I thought you said you guys were looking
for a gang member, like a teenager.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.578
You were right.
They alibied out.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.360
So who's in cuffs?

13:27.400 --> 13:29.660
Just a mugger who happened
to be working in the same area

13:29.700 --> 13:31.460
the same night
our vic was killed.

13:31.500 --> 13:35.760
Oh, yeah. He was picked up with a .45
on him which happens to be the same
round that wound in our vic.

13:35.800 --> 13:39.364
Just waiting on ballistics,
unless he confesses first.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.060
So where's his lawyer?

13:40.100 --> 13:44.000
Ooh, whoa, whoa.
He hasn't asked for one.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.260
Well, I know a guy.

13:45.300 --> 13:48.060
Oh, what's the matter, Castle?
Are you getting worried?

13:48.100 --> 13:49.660
Wor-worried?
I'll make you cry.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.660
You want to bet
or maybe double down?

13:51.700 --> 13:53.218
No, no, no, no, no, no,

13:53.500 --> 13:55.800
Not money. Humiliation.

13:55.800 --> 13:56.300
Hmm.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.860
Loser wears a dress
to the precinct for a week.

13:58.900 --> 14:01.738
Why stop there?
Loser also shaves his head.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.500
Or are you chicken?

14:09.400 --> 14:11.600
You're on, honey milk.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.152
–Honey milk.
–Damn it.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.560
For the record, Mr Hinkle,
you are admitting

14:17.600 --> 14:19.760
that you were Dr Cosway's
1:00 appointment?

14:19.800 --> 14:21.160
I knew this would happen.

14:21.200 --> 14:24.830
I knew it. First time I met her,
I knew she'd leave me.

14:24.900 --> 14:27.460
Why does this always happen?
Why do people keep leaving me?

14:27.500 --> 14:30.260
She didn't leave you, Mr Hinkle.
She was murdered.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.700
Yeah, just like my first wife.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.160
Your first wife was murdered?

14:35.200 --> 14:38.100
That's right.
I smothered her to death.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.900
Yeah. That's what she told me.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.700
I murdered her with love.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.720
That's why she left.

14:45.700 --> 14:48.660
Just tell us about your
last appointment with Dr Cosway.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.760
We were just starting to make progress.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.384
You know the irony here?

14:52.600 --> 14:55.400
Her death is my moment
of greatest crisis,

14:55.400 --> 14:57.512
And I don't have her to lean on.

14:59.100 --> 15:02.460
What was all the screaming about
at the appointment last Friday?

15:02.500 --> 15:05.560
Scream— Last Friday? I d—
I did not see her last Friday.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.460
You're in the books.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.700
“You're”, with an apostrophe.

15:10.100 --> 15:12.060
Yeah, well, I canceled an hour before.

15:12.100 --> 15:14.760
–You canceled?
–Yes. Yes, I was having chest pains.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.960
I went to the E.R
at st. Vincent's.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.960
$15·000 later, it turns out I
was just having a panic attack

15:21.000 --> 15:22.100
about mother.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.200
You know…

15:27.100 --> 15:28.460
I think we're done here. Thank you.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.860
Thank you. You know,
at least Dr Cosway

15:30.900 --> 15:33.260
didn't charge me
for canceling last-minute.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.200
Why not?

15:34.200 --> 15:36.160
Oh, she said she was gonna
have lunch with her husband,

15:36.200 --> 15:40.000
so it was time well spent.
–Thank you, Mr Hinkle.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.060
–Thank you.
–Oh, and by the way,

15:41.100 --> 15:44.460
it's a common mistake, but it's not
ironic that Dr Cosway is not here

15:44.500 --> 15:47.160
for you to lean on.
It's just simply tragic.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.560
It would be ironic if her death
made you feel better.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.500
Castle.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.400
Just— You can…

15:56.700 --> 15:58.060
What's with the super cop?

15:58.100 --> 16:00.660
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.360
Okay, thank you.
I appreciate it.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.908
Well, I'm down for $50.
You know that.

16:05.500 --> 16:06.800
Uh-huh.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.652
So what you got?

16:11.500 --> 16:13.960
I just got a ping
on Ashley's credit card.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.160
A lunch charge at Petit Bistro,
right next door to her office.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.760
The hostess confirmed that Ashley and
Jason were having lunch there on Friday,

16:20.800 --> 16:24.260
and the only reason she remembers it
is because they were making kind of a scene.

16:24.300 --> 16:25.488
He's our screamer.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.060
They were arguing all the
way back to the office.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.060
He's the one she was getting
a restraining order against?

16:30.100 --> 16:33.860
Jason's alibi that he was at the game with
his friend feel a little squishy to you?

16:33.900 --> 16:35.200
Like a wormy apple.

16:36.500 --> 16:37.760
–Hey, Karpowski.
–Yo.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.660
Why don't we take a
better look at Jason Cosway?

16:40.700 --> 16:43.360
Work situation, financials
and hotel bills.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.300
Yeah, okay. Copy that.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.700
–Want a coffee?
–No. Thanks.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.800
Hey, Stegner.

17:21.099 --> 17:24.069
Just… admiring the
great board work, Beckett.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.915
Care to share any insight?

17:26.400 --> 17:27.800
I really need to…

17:28.200 --> 17:29.300
go file.

17:29.700 --> 17:30.400
Uh-huh.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.766
I'd be more than happy
to take that off your hands.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.300
Son of a…

17:37.600 --> 17:38.800
Nobody move!

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
What is this?

17:42.600 --> 17:44.060
Girl scout cookie orders.

17:44.100 --> 17:47.000
Huh. Girl scout cookie orders.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.442
Yeah, I'm just helping out the troop.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.700
Funny. I didn't realize
Alexis was a girl scout.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.860
Oh, I know. She's got so many
activities, I can barely keep track.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.660
–Freakin' great.
–What happened?

17:57.700 --> 17:58.960
–Ballistics screwed us.
–Ballistics screwed us.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.026
Our mugger's gun doesn't match
the bullet taken from our vic.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.060
What's going on?

18:05.100 --> 18:07.900
Betting on murder cases,
guys? Really?

18:07.900 --> 18:09.760
–Whoa. What?
–That would be wrong.

18:09.800 --> 18:10.860
I've been telling you,
it's girl scout ord—

18:10.900 --> 18:13.540
Girl scout cookies
are sold in February.

18:13.900 --> 18:18.058
You guys should be ashamed of
yourselves. Now get back to work.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.200
Listen… I'm sorry.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.260
I know it was wrong.
I just thought—

18:30.300 --> 18:31.960
Beckett, you are never
gonna believe this.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.560
Oh, the bar on unbelievable
is pretty high right now.

18:34.600 --> 18:39.560
Vic's husband took out a $3-million life
insurance policy on his wife last month.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.600
$100 on us.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.260
Look, um, the life insurance
was Ashley's idea, okay?

18:46.300 --> 18:47.960
Okay, fine, Jason.
It was Ashley's idea.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.160
Can anyone confirm that?
–Yes, I'm sure someone can.

18:51.200 --> 18:51.960
Maybe a friend.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.860
Well, her best friend Brandy had
no idea about the life insurance,

18:54.900 --> 18:58.260
but she did know about a restraining order
that your wife was trying to get against you.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.000
That's… insane.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.900
It is absolutely ridiculous.

19:01.900 --> 19:03.260
You want to tell us
about last Friday?

19:03.300 --> 19:04.360
What about last Friday?

19:04.400 --> 19:07.860
About the screaming match at lunch
that led all the way back to her office.

19:07.900 --> 19:12.160
We have multiple witnesses, Jason.
–Okay. Great. You've witnesses.

19:12.200 --> 19:12.960
We had a fight.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.360
You know what it proves?
We're married.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.060
What did you fight about?

19:15.100 --> 19:17.260
I don't know what the fight
was about. I can't remember.

19:17.300 --> 19:19.500
See, I'm having a hard time

19:19.500 --> 19:20.460
How does he even know
we're watching?

19:20.500 --> 19:23.470
Ahh. No wonder she's
going after him so hard.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.160
I was at a basketball game.

19:26.200 --> 19:29.434
Oh, yes, that's right.
With your frat buddy Skip.

19:29.600 --> 19:33.200
Yes, juries do love it
when friends alibi friends.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.760
Why don't you get the hot dog guy
to vouch for me, okay? If you trust him.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.460
–What was your seat number?
–What do—Excuse me?

19:39.500 --> 19:41.560
Come on. It was just last night.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.778
Don't tell me you don't remember?

19:44.100 --> 19:46.560
They were— they were Skip's
tickets. Why don't you ask him?

19:46.600 --> 19:47.960
Don't tell me for one second

19:48.000 --> 19:50.060
you didn't have to get up
during that lame halftime show

19:50.100 --> 19:51.660
and remember what section
to go back to.

19:51.700 --> 19:55.160
The only thing I remember is the fact that we
were sitting there right behind the home bench.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.100
Oh, okay…

19:56.100 --> 19:58.160
–You ever have seats like that?
–Yeah, right.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.900
–So divorce isn't an option. Divorce?
–Divorce?

20:02.246 --> 20:05.383
–I'm going, too, bro.
–I didn't want a divorce, okay, pal⁈

20:05.423 --> 20:07.139
And I didn't kill my wife!

20:09.258 --> 20:10.644
So can we charge him?

20:10.789 --> 20:12.148
We still need evidence.

20:12.188 --> 20:13.639
I'm gonna get a warrant
for his apartment

20:13.679 --> 20:15.329
and see what it turns up.

20:17.976 --> 20:19.095
Are they watching TV?

20:19.135 --> 20:22.435
I'm afraid they've thrown in
the proverbial towel.

20:24.885 --> 20:25.936
Hey, guys.

20:25.976 --> 20:27.227
Everything okay?

20:27.505 --> 20:29.691
Yeah, we're just, uh,
just enjoying last night's game.

20:29.731 --> 20:32.624
Yeah. Isn't great when
you can get it on demand?

20:32.664 --> 20:35.040
Ooh, I love this part.
Check it out.

20:35.315 --> 20:37.174
<i>…everybody's covered up good,
And there yet is another…</i>

20:37.214 --> 20:39.629
Whoa. That's
their third time-out.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.228
Yeah, already,

20:41.408 --> 20:43.424
and they're just barely
halfway through the first half.

20:43.464 --> 20:46.295
Yeah, that would be,
what, just before 8:00?

20:46.335 --> 20:46.983
Yeah.

20:54.584 --> 20:55.904
That's Jason Cosway.

20:56.696 --> 20:58.865
And I believe that
that, my friends,

20:58.905 --> 21:01.523
Is the definition
of an airtight alibi.

21:02.230 --> 21:05.455
Castle, what size dress
do you wear, 6, 8?

21:06.654 --> 21:07.496
16.

21:27.184 --> 21:28.026
Dad.

21:29.379 --> 21:30.202
Yes.

21:30.713 --> 21:31.590
You okay?

21:35.839 --> 21:38.511
Have you ever been really
sure about something,

21:38.551 --> 21:40.993
and then have it all
just fall apart?

21:41.254 --> 21:43.102
As a matter of fact,
I have.

21:43.980 --> 21:44.874
Owen?

21:45.204 --> 21:46.622
It was a train wreck.

21:48.908 --> 21:49.832
What happened?

21:50.203 --> 21:51.109
Thalia.

21:51.441 --> 21:52.503
What's a Thalia?

21:52.503 --> 21:55.780
Some perky girl
with big… teeth.

21:56.389 --> 21:57.697
She came over to our table
gushing about

21:57.737 --> 22:00.299
how she and Owen went to camp Chumash
together third grade summer,

22:00.339 --> 22:02.456
and how she was
his first crush.

22:03.273 --> 22:05.683
The whole night was one
big walk down memory lane.

22:05.723 --> 22:07.295
I'm sorry, sweetie.

22:10.015 --> 22:11.863
And the weird part
was that…

22:11.913 --> 22:13.262
Owen didn't even
remember her.

22:13.302 --> 22:15.481
Not that it stopped him
from being totally into it.

22:15.521 --> 22:17.383
I mean, even in the taxi back,
he kept saying that

22:17.423 --> 22:20.107
how amazing it was that they met
after all these years at serendipity,

22:20.147 --> 22:23.117
how it was so serendipitous.
–Serendipitous.

22:26.014 --> 22:28.588
How am I supposed to compete
with that?

22:33.504 --> 22:34.566
Sorry.

22:38.460 --> 22:39.648
Where are you now?

22:39.771 --> 22:42.103
Yes, I'm on the elevator
right… Now.

22:42.143 --> 22:43.463
Where have you been?

22:43.888 --> 22:46.622
Apologizing for the male race.
We catch a break?

22:46.662 --> 22:48.078
No, but the boys did.

22:48.407 --> 22:49.037
Another mugger?

22:49.077 --> 22:52.509
I don't know. But they look
pretty hot on something.

22:52.575 --> 22:54.738
What? What do you have?

22:54.857 --> 22:56.868
Why don't you go ahead
and give him a little taste, bro?

22:56.908 --> 22:58.826
Turns out our vic had
a rent-controlled apartment.

22:58.866 --> 23:01.458
Stays in the family,
it stays rent controlled.

23:01.498 --> 23:04.769
$562 a month. 3-bedroom.

23:05.079 --> 23:05.715
I'd kill for that.

23:05.755 --> 23:06.679
According to a neighbor,

23:06.719 --> 23:08.264
cic's son-in-law borrowed money
from the old man

23:08.304 --> 23:11.757
a bunch of times over the years,
but recently, he cut him off.

23:11.797 --> 23:12.822
Son-in-law.

23:13.770 --> 23:14.589
Ryan.

23:16.051 --> 23:16.710
Really?

23:17.005 --> 23:18.040
Yeah, we're on it.

23:18.080 --> 23:18.839
–Come on.
–Something good?

23:18.879 --> 23:20.368
–Let's go.
–Wh-what is it?

23:20.408 --> 23:23.180
–Wouldn't you like to know?
–Hey, come on!

23:26.357 --> 23:27.821
I got a bad feeling
about this.

23:27.861 --> 23:30.033
Are we really rooting
against solving a murder?

23:30.073 --> 23:32.108
Well, I don't want
to shave my head. Do you?

23:32.148 --> 23:33.582
Why would I shave my head?

23:33.622 --> 23:34.608
You're in on the bet,
aren't you?

23:34.648 --> 23:36.430
Yeah, but I didn't realize—

23:37.761 --> 23:38.491
Beckett.

23:41.666 --> 23:43.448
Okay.
We'll be right there.

23:43.852 --> 23:46.626
Lanie just found something
in the forensic report.

23:46.666 --> 23:49.768
Well, I hope it's better
than their son-in-law.

23:50.916 --> 23:52.764
And you're sure it was them?

23:53.387 --> 23:54.732
Okay. Thanks.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.774
I don't even want to know.

23:57.814 --> 23:59.232
Two bartenders and the manager

23:59.272 --> 24:02.032
put Frank's son-in-law Eric
and daughter Christina uptown

24:02.072 --> 24:04.279
at their friend Eddie's
birthday party at Dublin house

24:04.319 --> 24:05.727
from 9:15
till after midnight.

24:05.767 --> 24:07.809
Dude, if I have to shave
my head, it's going on you.

24:07.849 --> 24:09.940
–What are you doing here?
–What are you doing here?

24:09.980 --> 24:11.284
Lanie called us.

24:11.362 --> 24:12.732
–No, she called us.
–Yeah.

24:12.772 --> 24:15.177
Actually, I called both of you.

24:15.695 --> 24:18.203
I think your cases
might be connected.

24:22.077 --> 24:25.495
Perlmutter was giving me the rundown
on Ryan and Esposito's mugging case

24:25.535 --> 24:28.057
when a certain forensic detail
popped out at me.

24:28.097 --> 24:29.727
Orthosilicic acid.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.088
Ortho what now?

24:31.088 --> 24:33.926
It's the fancy term
for saltwater compound.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.944
–That's not very specific.
–True.

24:35.984 --> 24:38.406
But we identified the diatoms
in the sample as well,

24:38.446 --> 24:40.094
which makes it
extremely specific.

24:40.134 --> 24:42.680
It narrows it down
to a single body of water.

24:42.720 --> 24:44.077
Oh, so our guy took a swim?

24:44.117 --> 24:46.033
Not quite.
It was only trace amounts.

24:46.073 --> 24:49.377
But we found orthosilicic acid
with the exact same diatoms

24:49.417 --> 24:51.121
on Ashley Cosway as well.

24:51.121 --> 24:53.122
Both victims had contact
with the same body of water?

24:53.162 --> 24:54.952
–Direct contact.
–What are the odds?

24:54.992 --> 24:57.578
It'd be like finding the same
fingerprint on both bodies.

24:57.618 --> 24:59.198
Do we know
what body of water?

24:59.238 --> 25:02.208
No, I would need a sample
to test it against.

25:03.913 --> 25:04.562
Castle.

25:04.562 --> 25:05.868
Could it be
a small body of water?

25:05.908 --> 25:08.020
Sure, as long
as it's saltwater.

25:10.144 --> 25:12.335
Dr Cosway's fish tank.
Check out Nemo.

25:12.375 --> 25:14.619
Clown fish
need saltwater to live.

25:14.882 --> 25:17.208
Okay, but how did this get
on both of our vics?

25:17.248 --> 25:19.884
Wouldn't they have had to stick
their hands in there or something?

25:19.924 --> 25:22.894
You see that salt encrustation
along the top?

25:22.980 --> 25:23.358
Yeah.

25:23.358 --> 25:25.325
The pump just kicks it
into the air.

25:25.365 --> 25:26.960
Yeah, anyone who spent time
in that office

25:27.000 --> 25:30.387
would have trace amounts of that
tank-specific saltwater compound on them.

25:30.427 --> 25:32.452
So then Frank had to
have been in Ashley's office

25:32.492 --> 25:33.904
sometime before
he was murdered.

25:33.944 --> 25:37.001
That's possible, but remember,
Ashley was murdered first.

25:37.041 --> 25:38.667
Then our perp was in there.

25:38.707 --> 25:40.210
That's where he got
the compound on him.

25:40.250 --> 25:42.615
Then he transferred it to Frank
when he took his watch and wallet.

25:42.655 --> 25:46.615
Which means both of our vics
were killed by the same person.

25:47.348 --> 25:48.662
I thought
Dad was mugged.

25:48.702 --> 25:50.414
Yeah, like—like randomly.

25:50.629 --> 25:52.521
We don't believe
it was random anymore.

25:52.561 --> 25:55.201
Mr Cosway's wife Ashley
was killed earlier that night.

25:55.241 --> 25:57.266
We think the same person
killed your father

25:57.306 --> 26:00.558
And then tried to stage it
as if there were two isolated incidents.

26:00.598 --> 26:03.600
We're trying to find
a connection between them.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.114
This is Mrs Cosway.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.056
And this is Mr Anderson.

26:09.081 --> 26:11.193
Do either of them
look familiar?

26:11.530 --> 26:13.949
No. Not at all. I'm sorry.

26:14.171 --> 26:16.447
Mrs Cosway
was a therapist.

26:16.588 --> 26:18.116
Did your father
ever go to therapy?

26:18.156 --> 26:20.083
Dad? No.

26:20.724 --> 26:22.054
No disrespect to your wife,

26:22.094 --> 26:24.322
but he didn't really
go for that kind of stuff.

26:24.362 --> 26:26.512
Well, this is a list
of Mrs Cosway's patients.

26:26.552 --> 26:27.824
Would you mind
taking a look at the names,

26:27.864 --> 26:30.042
see if you recognize
any of them?

26:32.817 --> 26:34.214
I-I don't think so.

26:35.270 --> 26:35.934
–No.
–No, I…

26:35.974 --> 26:36.964
Take your time.

26:37.138 --> 26:38.925
Do you really think
there's a connection here?

26:38.965 --> 26:41.165
I mean, we—we live in
different parts of the city,

26:41.205 --> 26:42.753
You know, we work
at different places,

26:42.793 --> 26:43.189
We're…

26:44.455 --> 26:46.788
Go ahead. You could say it.
We're black and you're white.

26:46.828 --> 26:49.165
No, I—no, I'm just saying,
we're different.

26:49.205 --> 26:50.028
That's all I was saying.

26:50.068 --> 26:53.214
They may have inadvertently
witnessed something

26:53.566 --> 26:56.754
or been privy to some information
that someone very powerful

26:56.794 --> 26:58.017
wanted to keep under wraps.

26:58.057 --> 26:59.795
There are any number
of possibilities.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.419
We just want—
–Grovner.

27:02.305 --> 27:02.865
What was that?

27:02.905 --> 27:06.073
Uh, this name—Grovner.
It—it kinda rings a bell.

27:07.112 --> 27:09.144
Do you remember
about five years back,

27:09.184 --> 27:11.355
some kid's dad shoved him
for some reason?

27:11.395 --> 27:13.749
Y-yeah. School security
got involved.

27:13.789 --> 27:15.584
I think his name was Grovner.

27:15.624 --> 27:17.542
We'll get a warrant
for his patient file.

27:17.582 --> 27:20.156
If there's a connection,
we'll find it.

27:26.397 --> 27:30.494
So… The principal at I.S 1-6-1
said that Grovner assaulted your vic

27:30.534 --> 27:34.046
after Mr Anderson reported him
on suspicion of child abuse.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.152
Which is why Grovner and his wife
went to couples' counseling.

27:36.192 --> 27:37.486
Apparently it didn't go
too well,

27:37.526 --> 27:40.156
Because they ended up filing
for divorce, and get this—

27:40.196 --> 27:42.921
Mrs Cosway testified
against Grovner in court.

27:42.961 --> 27:45.481
So Grovner had reason
to go after both our victims.

27:45.521 --> 27:47.579
Yeah, went away for five years
for domestic abuse.

27:47.619 --> 27:49.386
Says right here
he was released last month.

27:49.426 --> 27:50.508
What are the odds, huh,

27:50.548 --> 27:53.229
two people from opposite lives
being connected by one jackhole?

27:53.269 --> 27:55.771
Just demonstrates that
any two people can be connected.

27:55.811 --> 27:58.351
–Yeah, like the movie “Crash.”
–“Crash” is overrated.

27:58.391 --> 28:01.008
Actually, it's more like
six degrees of Kevin Bacon.

28:01.048 --> 28:02.170
I got a question.

28:02.520 --> 28:03.940
Now that we're all working
the same case,

28:03.980 --> 28:06.818
does that mean the bet's off?
–Hell, yeah.

28:17.321 --> 28:18.641
You got the address?

28:18.839 --> 28:20.357
Yeah, it's around back.

28:21.897 --> 28:24.557
Banner day. Gonna close
two cases with one arrest.

28:24.597 --> 28:25.259
Like Christmas.

28:25.299 --> 28:27.350
Don't decorate the tree
just yet, boys.

28:27.390 --> 28:28.404
It might be a coincidence.

28:28.444 --> 28:30.494
Oh, come on,
Debbie Downer.

28:30.494 --> 28:33.546
There are no such things
as coincidences in murder cases.

28:33.586 --> 28:35.205
How many times
do I have to tell you?

28:35.245 --> 28:38.498
I mean, it's the basic foundation
of every crime book I've ever written—

28:38.538 --> 28:40.436
“no coincidences.”

28:44.078 --> 28:44.928
That's him.

28:46.629 --> 28:47.470
Ready?

28:49.373 --> 28:50.561
Put your hands up!

28:50.712 --> 28:52.061
–Let's see 'em, buddy. Keep 'em up.
–Get your hands up!

28:52.101 --> 28:53.962
–Hands where we can see 'em!
–Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:54.002 --> 28:56.459
Wesley Grovner,
I'm detective Kate Beckett.

28:56.499 --> 28:59.139
What, did I miss
another parole meeting?

28:59.391 --> 29:01.217
He's clean… So to speak.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.618
Where were you
last Tuesday night?

29:06.172 --> 29:07.379
Am I being punked?

29:07.379 --> 29:09.909
If by “punked” you mean
arrested for murder, yeah.

29:09.949 --> 29:11.999
You think I went somewhere
Tuesday night and killed somebody?

29:12.039 --> 29:13.974
Actually, two somebodies.

29:16.732 --> 29:18.231
Hey, I'm Houdini.

29:19.553 --> 29:20.697
Nice bling, huh?

29:24.943 --> 29:26.018
Check this out.

29:29.360 --> 29:33.242
This stoop is the edge of my earth
since I busted parole a week ago.

29:33.282 --> 29:36.120
Whatever you think I did,
I ain't your guy.

29:41.015 --> 29:42.929
That's quite the coincidence.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.864
How dare you!
How dare you…

29:49.881 --> 29:52.211
take my dress! You're as
thoughtless as your father!

29:52.251 --> 29:54.047
I'm sorry! I—stop! No.

29:54.047 --> 29:56.019
–You're a beastie!
–No! I didn't—

29:56.059 --> 29:57.559
I didn't think it was a big deal!

29:57.599 --> 29:59.375
–I ought to break your little wrists.
–No.

29:59.415 --> 30:01.065
Mother,
Have you finally…

30:01.842 --> 30:03.558
Have I finally what,
dear?

30:04.423 --> 30:05.059
Hey, dad.

30:06.810 --> 30:07.624
You're rehearsing.

30:07.664 --> 30:09.182
Yes, I have a callback.

30:09.279 --> 30:10.724
Oh, and you believed us.

30:10.764 --> 30:12.678
Oh, my God!
That's marvelous.

30:13.094 --> 30:15.998
No, I am a better actress
than I think I am.

30:18.254 --> 30:20.565
You okay, dad?
You look upset.

30:20.629 --> 30:23.886
Turns out something I was so sure of
was just a coincidence.

30:23.926 --> 30:25.450
Oh, is this about
the murder?

30:25.490 --> 30:26.229
Exactly.

30:26.801 --> 30:29.581
It so happens that our
two victims were connected.

30:29.621 --> 30:31.415
It just had nothing to do
with their deaths.

30:31.455 --> 30:33.737
You know, I bet
if you looked hard enough,

30:33.777 --> 30:36.100
you'd find a connection
between everybody in this city.

30:36.140 --> 30:37.880
I mean, that's the great thing
about New York.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.768
Yeah, and if there wasn't
a connection,

30:39.808 --> 30:42.123
you could always pretend
there's one.

30:42.163 --> 30:43.033
Besides the rehearsal,

30:43.073 --> 30:45.617
we have another drama
going on here this evening.

30:45.657 --> 30:46.807
Oh, Owen?

30:47.081 --> 30:50.391
You know how Thalia said she had
a crush on Owen at camp Chumash?

30:50.431 --> 30:51.841
Serendipity
at serendipity, yeah.

30:51.881 --> 30:54.814
No. More like subterfuge
at serendipity.

30:54.814 --> 30:56.698
She never even went
to camp Chumash,

30:56.738 --> 30:57.653
but her friend did.

30:57.693 --> 31:00.327
And Thalia wanted to meet Owen,
so she staged the whole thing.

31:00.367 --> 31:03.291
Oh, that is so…
budding sociopath.

31:03.291 --> 31:04.698
I knew it couldn't be
a coincidence.

31:04.738 --> 31:07.389
I mean, really,
what are the odds?

31:11.194 --> 31:13.007
Yeah. What are the odds?

31:33.688 --> 31:35.367
Hey, Castle.
How you doing?

31:35.407 --> 31:36.523
Well, for a second last night,

31:36.563 --> 31:39.401
I thought my mother
was beating Alexis, so…

31:39.490 --> 31:42.922
Yeah. Well, Grovner was
a head-turner for all of us.

31:43.857 --> 31:45.969
His GPS checked out,
by the way.

31:47.647 --> 31:48.646
Well, “Crash” was
on this morning,

31:48.686 --> 31:49.424
followed by “Footloose,”

31:49.464 --> 31:51.896
so I guess
anything can happen.

31:54.507 --> 31:55.403
Are you okay?

31:56.236 --> 31:56.920
Yeah.

32:00.505 --> 32:03.673
It's just, this one
reminds me of my mom's case.

32:06.091 --> 32:08.271
What Frank Anderson's family
must be going through,

32:08.311 --> 32:09.698
especially Christina…

32:10.295 --> 32:12.767
Mourning her dad's death
thinking that it was random,

32:12.807 --> 32:15.183
and then finding out
that it wasn't.

32:15.988 --> 32:17.351
I guess you could say,
what does it matter?

32:17.391 --> 32:18.680
The person that you love
is dead.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.926
But knowing why matters.

32:26.194 --> 32:26.724
Yo.

32:27.433 --> 32:28.712
Fish tank's a bust.

32:28.829 --> 32:29.855
What?

32:30.102 --> 32:32.914
Lanie called.
Water sample is not a match.

32:32.914 --> 32:34.518
–Can you believe that?
–We're nowhere.

32:34.558 --> 32:36.219
What is it
with these two cases?

32:36.259 --> 32:38.008
Yeah, Grovner was almost
too good to be true.

32:38.048 --> 32:38.696
Not almost.

32:38.736 --> 32:40.024
Yeah, and you guys
and the husband.

32:40.064 --> 32:41.739
I was sure it was him,
and your son-in-law.

32:41.779 --> 32:43.561
I know. Same deal. Felt it.

32:45.897 --> 32:49.093
Okay, it's not the fish tank,
but they are connected.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.090
We just have to
figure out how.

32:50.130 --> 32:52.431
It's just, we've been over
these cases so many times,

32:52.471 --> 32:54.715
it's hard
to see straight anymore.

32:55.451 --> 32:58.671
All right.
We'll start over. Fresh eyes.

32:58.865 --> 33:00.427
You take our murder.
We'll take yours.

33:00.467 --> 33:01.127
All right.

33:03.693 --> 33:04.683
Say that again.

33:06.412 --> 33:08.922
You take our murder.
We'll take yours.

33:10.984 --> 33:12.436
Could it be that easy?

33:13.854 --> 33:14.778
You take mine.

33:15.164 --> 33:16.128
I'll take yours.

33:16.168 --> 33:17.761
What are you getting at, Castle?

33:17.801 --> 33:19.111
“Strangers on a train.”

33:19.151 --> 33:19.988
The Hitchcock movie?

33:20.028 --> 33:22.737
I'm partial to the novel by
Patricia Highsmith, but, yes.

33:22.777 --> 33:27.021
we have two strong suspects,
but with airtight alibis, right?

33:27.294 --> 33:29.604
–Right.
–We know they're connected.

33:29.749 --> 33:32.257
What if the connection
is the killers?

33:32.437 --> 33:34.529
Jason and Eric committed
each other's murders.

33:34.569 --> 33:36.336
And made sure they had
an airtight alibi

33:36.376 --> 33:39.259
for the murder they knew
they'd be suspected of.

33:39.299 --> 33:41.468
It's not our victims
who are connected.

33:41.508 --> 33:44.728
It's our murderers.
Crisscross.

33:45.407 --> 33:49.338
Okay, so we know Jason was at the garden
watching the game till it finished at 10:00.

33:49.378 --> 33:52.168
And then he made the call
from Ashley's office at 11:47.

33:52.208 --> 33:55.713
The garden is on 32nd.
Her office is on 18th.

33:55.713 --> 33:57.421
Would've taken him
max 20 minutes.

33:57.461 --> 33:59.929
–So why did it take him two hours?
–Because, Esposito,

33:59.969 --> 34:02.550
he jumped in a cab,
went uptown, killed Frank.

34:02.590 --> 34:03.832
Which happened at 11:00.

34:03.872 --> 34:08.268
He easily makes it back to his wife's office
in time to find her body at 11:47.

34:08.308 --> 34:10.621
And we know that Eric
clocked out of work at 6:03.

34:10.661 --> 34:11.859
And Ashley's killed at 8:00.

34:11.899 --> 34:14.752
He shows up for the party
at the bar at 9:15.

34:14.792 --> 34:18.106
Something tells me their alibis
are not going to be so airtight

34:18.146 --> 34:19.598
for the other murders.

34:21.656 --> 34:24.428
Mr Cosway, we were
just coming to see you.

34:24.641 --> 34:26.867
Oh, hey.
You guys have news?

34:26.867 --> 34:29.513
I mean, is it the old patient of Ashley's
that turn out to be anything or—

34:29.553 --> 34:31.599
No, but we are
making progress.

34:32.051 --> 34:33.757
Okay. Uh, what can I do
for you?

34:33.797 --> 34:36.771
Just like to ask you a few questions
about the night of the murder.

34:36.811 --> 34:38.206
Do you guys have
any suspects at all yet or—

34:38.246 --> 34:40.197
–We're looking at someone right now.
–Okay.

34:40.237 --> 34:41.935
Well, actually, I have to meet
the movers at Ashley's office.

34:41.975 --> 34:43.321
So if you don't mind
walking with me…

34:43.360 --> 34:44.167
Not at all.

34:44.840 --> 34:48.679
Could you tell us what you did
right after the basketball game?

34:48.719 --> 34:50.219
After?
Well, why do you ask?

34:50.260 --> 34:52.663
We're just trying to get
our timeline straight.

34:52.703 --> 34:54.531
You're not accusing me of
killing my wife again, are you?

34:54.571 --> 34:56.558
I can assure you
that we are 100% certain

34:56.598 --> 34:58.040
you did not kill Ashley.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.823
It's just,
the night of the murder,

34:59.863 --> 35:02.897
you said that you were on your way
to pick her up right after the game.

35:02.937 --> 35:04.070
Yeah, so?

35:04.072 --> 35:08.148
Well, then why did it take you two hours
to get from the Garden to 18th street?

35:08.188 --> 35:09.990
Look, I knew Ash wanted
to work late, right?

35:10.030 --> 35:13.726
I didn't want to bother her,
So I just killed some time.

35:14.330 --> 35:15.536
Sorry. Go ahead.

35:17.276 --> 35:18.913
Uh, and then I stopped
at a newsstand.

35:18.953 --> 35:19.583
Where?

35:19.873 --> 35:22.513
Uh, somewhere on 7th.
Maybe it was 26th.

35:22.625 --> 35:25.372
I don't know. Anyway, I bought
myself a slice of pizza…

35:25.412 --> 35:26.221
At Ray's.

35:26.476 --> 35:28.786
Original famous
or famous original?

35:28.844 --> 35:30.848
There's one on 28th.
And there's one on 23rd.

35:30.888 --> 35:32.406
I can't remember which.

35:32.765 --> 35:34.637
I'm a little, uh,
confused here.

35:34.677 --> 35:36.285
You know, there is somebody
out there that killed my wife.

35:36.325 --> 35:39.493
Mr Cosway, we're just
trying to figure this out.

35:40.320 --> 35:43.056
Um, I, uh, after that,
I went home.

35:43.280 --> 35:44.806
Is there anyone
that can vouch for that?

35:44.846 --> 35:46.983
Yeah, I'm sure
somebody in my building.

35:47.023 --> 35:48.990
Thank you so much
for your time.

35:49.030 --> 35:49.850
Of course.

35:56.291 --> 35:58.629
<i>(man) Last call for express
service to Wall Street.</i>

35:58.669 --> 36:01.342
<i>Last call, express service
to Wall Street.</i>

36:01.382 --> 36:04.409
<i>last call, express ferry
from Chelsea pier 66,</i>

36:04.449 --> 36:06.989
<i>Greenwich Village
to the World Financial Center.</i>

36:07.029 --> 36:08.151
<i>Last call.</i>

36:08.267 --> 36:10.312
Looks like we found
our body of water.

36:10.352 --> 36:11.672
Strangers on a boat?

36:20.626 --> 36:21.492
So what's the verdict?

36:21.532 --> 36:24.130
Eric Marx takes the same
water taxi to work, too.

36:24.170 --> 36:25.924
“Bam,” said the lady.
There's our connection.

36:25.964 --> 36:27.126
Oh, no. It gets better.

36:27.166 --> 36:29.575
Lanie ran the substance on our vics
against the Hudson river water.

36:29.615 --> 36:30.572
It's a match.

36:30.572 --> 36:31.901
Marx gets on
the boat uptown,

36:31.941 --> 36:33.542
Cosway joins him
at Chelsea piers,

36:33.582 --> 36:35.519
and they ride to pier 11
together.

36:35.559 --> 36:37.779
So one day, maybe
they start talking—

36:37.819 --> 36:38.960
maybe about
the yankee bullpen,

36:39.000 --> 36:42.754
maybe about the attractive secretary
leaning up against the railing.

36:42.794 --> 36:45.119
Oh, and Jason starts grumbling
about his wife.

36:45.159 --> 36:47.552
Eric maybe mentions
how he covets Frank's apartment.

36:47.592 --> 36:49.014
Yeah, well, there's
an open upper deck.

36:49.054 --> 36:50.990
I figure that's where they were
doing their plottin'.

36:51.030 --> 36:53.088
And how the water from the Hudson
got on both of them.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.794
It gets transferred from
Eric Marx's jacket and gloves

36:55.834 --> 36:57.127
to Ashley Cosway
when they struggle.

36:57.167 --> 37:00.184
Then to Frank Anderson when Jason
Cosway swipes his watch and wallet.

37:00.224 --> 37:00.769
Done deal.

37:00.809 --> 37:02.638
Except it's all
circumstantial.

37:02.678 --> 37:06.270
The DA will never buy it
without hard evidence or a confession.

37:06.310 --> 37:08.488
Oh, we're gonna get
a confession.

37:12.048 --> 37:13.695
Not if we get one first.

37:13.695 --> 37:16.077
So… Bet's back on?

37:16.472 --> 37:19.270
You bet your britches,
the bet is back on.

37:30.775 --> 37:32.041
What are the odds?

37:35.527 --> 37:36.126
You guys really think

37:36.166 --> 37:39.178
a jury is gonna believe in such
a crazy story like this, huh?

37:39.218 --> 37:41.009
Juries are smart.

37:41.397 --> 37:42.783
Yeah. Yeah, they are.

37:43.868 --> 37:44.362
But you see,

37:44.402 --> 37:46.794
they're gonna have to do
two separate trials here.

37:46.834 --> 37:48.667
And the prosecutor is gonna
have to convince them

37:48.707 --> 37:51.466
that I killed someone
who I have no connection to

37:51.506 --> 37:53.903
and no motive whatsoever
to want dead.

37:53.943 --> 37:55.311
And to me, that's ridiculous.

37:55.351 --> 37:59.443
Sounds like you've given this
some serious thought, Mr Cosway.

37:59.897 --> 38:00.698
Cute.

38:01.335 --> 38:02.397
But wrong.

38:02.397 --> 38:05.122
You made a pact with Eric Marx
on the deck of that boat.

38:05.162 --> 38:09.001
Don't crack. No one will ever
be able to prove what you did.

38:09.041 --> 38:10.936
I told you guys already,
I only met him the other day.

38:10.976 --> 38:13.882
You rode the same water taxi
to work every day.

38:13.922 --> 38:16.464
And so does a hundred
other people… Every day.

38:16.504 --> 38:18.214
–It was your idea, wasn't it?
–Really?

38:18.254 --> 38:18.888
Yeah.

38:19.723 --> 38:22.042
There's always one alpha
in every conspiracy,

38:22.082 --> 38:23.204
and that was you.

38:23.983 --> 38:25.616
Eric was malleable,
wasn't he?

38:25.656 --> 38:27.636
And that suited you
just fine.

38:29.185 --> 38:31.330
But Ashley wasn't, was she?

38:32.818 --> 38:34.802
She was a strong,
professional woman—

38:34.842 --> 38:36.807
a psychologist, no less.

38:36.921 --> 38:38.811
You couldn't just
push her around.

38:38.851 --> 38:40.501
Then why did I marry her?

38:41.957 --> 38:45.319
That's the question
you asked yourself every day, isn't it?

38:45.359 --> 38:48.461
Because you'd realized,
you didn't want a wife.

38:48.938 --> 38:50.254
You wanted a puppy.

38:51.980 --> 38:54.166
Now you get a judge with
political aspirations, bro—

38:54.206 --> 38:55.265
Yeah, we're talking
death penalty.

38:55.305 --> 38:57.389
New York's still
a lethal injection state.

38:57.429 --> 38:59.144
Now you confess,
you cop a plea,

38:59.184 --> 39:00.305
that's a different story.

39:00.345 --> 39:02.865
You're gonna save the state
all sorts of money on a trial.

39:02.905 --> 39:04.511
Practically guaranteed
to get off with just life.

39:04.551 --> 39:05.885
Yeah, and then—
and then the judge

39:05.925 --> 39:07.582
can get his political bones
on someone else,

39:07.622 --> 39:08.667
like your boy Jason there.

39:08.707 --> 39:09.906
No, I-I know my rights,
All right?

39:09.946 --> 39:11.457
So you can stop with this
whole good cop/bad—

39:11.497 --> 39:12.477
It's good you know
your rights, Eric,

39:12.517 --> 39:14.694
Because your buddy Jason
just rolled on you.

39:14.734 --> 39:16.457
–Oh, man. Come on.
–Oh, yeah.

39:16.497 --> 39:18.224
Cosway just signed
his confession.

39:18.264 --> 39:20.640
Copped a nice little plea
at your expense. Sorry.

39:20.680 --> 39:22.640
Told you we'd get
our guy first.

39:22.680 --> 39:24.330
No, no, wait! Wait, wait.

39:30.539 --> 39:32.717
It was—it was his idea,
not mine.

39:34.435 --> 39:36.217
He planned the whole thing.

39:51.187 --> 39:52.811
Yo, Ryan, you were
on fire in there.

39:52.851 --> 39:54.530
New nickname—Iceposito.

39:55.440 --> 39:57.156
Excellent work, detective.

39:57.285 --> 39:58.501
Yeah, well, once we realized

39:58.541 --> 40:00.235
that Jason was the alpha
and wouldn't break,

40:00.275 --> 40:02.529
It was obvious that Eric
was the weak link.

40:02.569 --> 40:03.161
Nice.

40:03.237 --> 40:05.942
When you guys came in the room,
and we knew you were playing,

40:05.982 --> 40:06.793
everything just kinda…

40:06.833 --> 40:09.060
Yeah. That's right. Of course,
we were right with you guys.

40:09.100 --> 40:10.039
Oh, please.

40:10.039 --> 40:11.666
That was the whole point
was that you weren't in on it.

40:11.706 --> 40:12.358
That's how we sold it.

40:12.398 --> 40:13.985
Well, that's neither here
nor there,

40:14.025 --> 40:16.339
because we won the bet.
–How's that?

40:16.379 --> 40:19.306
–Our guy broke.
–Yeah, because we broke him.

40:19.306 --> 40:21.674
Uh, so what?
It's like soccer.

40:21.674 --> 40:24.083
You score in our goal,
it's still our point.

40:24.123 --> 40:26.251
Soccer, really?
You're going with that one?

40:26.291 --> 40:27.071
Works for me.

40:27.111 --> 40:28.174
Well, then how about baseball?

40:28.214 --> 40:31.448
'Cause this team just knocked it
out of the park.

40:34.430 --> 40:36.871
Yeah, but our team
was supposed to be up at bat.

40:36.911 --> 40:37.888
Again with that one?

40:37.928 --> 40:39.139
Your team never made it
to the field

40:39.179 --> 40:40.725
because they were too scared
to get off the bus.

40:40.765 --> 40:42.853
Uh, Castle,
our team drove the bus.

40:42.893 --> 40:44.786
Yeah,
Well, then how about Nascar?

40:44.826 --> 40:47.273
As our car flew
to the checkered line,

40:47.313 --> 40:48.646
you guys crashed and burned.

40:48.686 --> 40:50.426
Under a beautiful full moon.

40:50.466 --> 40:51.654
That's just corny…

40:52.211 --> 40:55.368
