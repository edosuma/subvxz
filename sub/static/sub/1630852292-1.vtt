00:08.275 --> 00:10.243
[TJ]
Welcome back to The Challenge.

00:10.343 --> 00:13.080
You have no idea
what's in store for you.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.083
[woman 1] I will do anything
for this money.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.850
[man 1] I'm ready
to take fucking heads off

00:16.949 --> 00:18.318
till I'm the last one standing.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.120
[woman 2]
Nobody likes you.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.454
[woman 3]
Came here to beat some ass.

00:21.554 --> 00:24.024
[woman 2]
250,000 [bleep] dollars now.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.227
[man 2] You think you're tough
all the time?

00:26.327 --> 00:31.399
* *

00:50.417 --> 00:52.119
[Tina]
Don't call it a comeback.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.954
I'm known in the Challenge world
for getting angry,

00:55.054 --> 00:58.459
being mean and my one-liners.

00:59.159 --> 01:00.561
Oh, you got a lot of nerve,
bitch.

01:00.661 --> 01:01.829
You [bleep] idiot!

01:01.929 --> 01:02.996
This isn't my first Challenge.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.932
-Beth.
-Tina.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.201
My life is fabulous.
I have a husband.

01:08.301 --> 01:11.971
No kids. I don't work.
I have a pool in the backyard.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.840
Life is really good.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.909
Getting ready for y'all,
motherfuckers.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.210
Take some bitches out.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.579
I just want to see
if I still got it.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.515
I just want to see
if Tina's still there.

01:21.614 --> 01:24.251
[Brad]
I am considered in the top tier
of competitors of this game.

01:24.352 --> 01:27.855
I have that internal switch
to kind of go into savage mode.

01:27.954 --> 01:30.090
Let's go!

01:31.424 --> 01:34.361
Get it! Fuck you! Let's go.

01:34.462 --> 01:35.795
[women screaming]

01:35.896 --> 01:37.365
[Brad] I've had a really rough
few years.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.432
I lost my job
in the beginning of COVID,

01:39.533 --> 01:42.034
but I still have a lot
of blessings to count at home.

01:42.135 --> 01:43.471
I've got two incredible sons.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.239
I'm going to fight my heart out
for that money.

01:45.338 --> 01:47.207
I know there's some great
competitors in the house

01:47.307 --> 01:48.676
but I also know
that I'm one of them.

01:48.776 --> 01:52.579
* *

01:52.680 --> 01:56.817
My Challenge reputation is
probably being wild and crazy.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.852
Give us a [bleep] break...

01:58.951 --> 02:00.221
[yelling]

02:00.320 --> 02:03.891
Punching mirrors,
dancing on stripper poles.

02:03.990 --> 02:06.727
[cheering]

02:06.826 --> 02:10.364
Oh, my God, my daughter's going
to watch that one day. Um...

02:10.463 --> 02:14.134
But now, as a mom, a wife,
things have changed.

02:14.235 --> 02:17.504
I'm a strong Black woman
and I can do anything.

02:17.604 --> 02:20.473
I think what makes me
an all-star is my heart.

02:20.574 --> 02:23.276
I'm about to give you
a thousand percent of me.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.146
I'm an all-star
because I'm the only one

02:26.247 --> 02:27.914
who's won four in a row.

02:28.014 --> 02:30.717
Last season was the first time
I have ever lost a final.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.420
That's a tough pill to swallow.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.389
Oh, you motherfucker.

02:35.489 --> 02:38.225
I've never let something
just slip out of my hands

02:38.325 --> 02:39.727
that I knew I had in the bag.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.728
That's why I'm back
for another season.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.129
I am back for redemption.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.299
Game on, motherfuckers.

02:51.572 --> 02:55.742

02:57.844 --> 03:01.181
["Everybody (Backstreet's Back)"
by Backstreet Boys playing]

03:03.883 --> 03:07.754
* Everybody *

03:07.854 --> 03:11.123
* Rock your body *

03:12.592 --> 03:18.498
* Everybody
Rock your body right *

03:19.866 --> 03:22.034
* Backstreet's back
All right *

03:22.134 --> 03:23.736
-Yeah.
-What's up brother?

03:23.836 --> 03:26.073
Oh, my God.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.375
Hey, what's up, Tyler?
Long time no see.

03:27.474 --> 03:28.575
What are you doing these days?

03:28.675 --> 03:30.076
I'm just bartending here
in CancÃºn.

03:30.176 --> 03:33.045
[Derrick]
All right, man, that's great.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.582
What makes me an all-star?
I mean, just look at my record.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.985
Out of four Challenges,
I won two of them.

03:38.085 --> 03:41.187
[whoops, shouts]

03:41.288 --> 03:42.622
My eliminations,

03:42.723 --> 03:45.192
I've had to go against
the biggest and the best.

03:45.293 --> 03:49.096
[people screaming]

03:49.195 --> 03:50.229
Yeah.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.365
[man 3] Go, T! Go!

03:53.066 --> 03:54.567
Going down!

03:54.668 --> 03:57.003
Whoa.

03:57.103 --> 03:59.239
I live in North Dakota.
I'm a teacher.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.308
I'm playing for my students
that I teach.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.243
Nowadays I'm pushing 235.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.479
I'm all man beast, total bear.

04:07.281 --> 04:10.518
Some say zaddy,
you can call it what you will.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.353
I'll tip you next time.

04:13.454 --> 04:14.987
[speaking indistinctly]

04:15.087 --> 04:18.391
* Now throw your hands up
In the air *

04:19.759 --> 04:22.129
* And wave them around
Like you just don't care *

04:22.228 --> 04:23.831
[cheering]

04:23.930 --> 04:26.899
* If you want to party
Let me hear you yell *

04:27.000 --> 04:28.968
-To an incredible team.
-Yes.

04:29.069 --> 04:33.072
I won the first female
solo Challenge ever.

04:35.074 --> 04:38.612
This has been like the most
amazing experience of my life.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.314
I'm a strong competitor.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.550
I work at an army
wellness center,

04:42.649 --> 04:44.317
so I help people get fit.

04:44.418 --> 04:47.555
The old me playing
The Challenge was very insecure

04:47.654 --> 04:49.356
whereas now
after having two kids

04:49.456 --> 04:52.492
and being married for 13 years,
I'm more self-assured.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.495
I don't care as much
what other people think of me.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.396
[chuckles]

04:55.495 --> 04:57.630
Are you ready for this?

04:57.730 --> 04:59.332
[Kendal]
Yeah, how do you feel about it?

04:59.432 --> 05:01.067
This is the first time
back since Inferno?

05:01.168 --> 05:02.069
Yeah.

05:02.168 --> 05:04.404
[laughter]

05:06.706 --> 05:09.076
[Kendal] Yeah.
I think that's insane.

05:09.509 --> 05:12.245
The last time you've seen me
was on The Inferno I.

05:12.346 --> 05:16.684
I played in the infamous
elimination with Kendal.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.920
[man 4] I've been the most
honest with you out of anybody

05:20.019 --> 05:22.122
-in this place here.
-[Leah] You're an ass.

05:22.221 --> 05:23.290
See, when this is over,

05:23.391 --> 05:24.625
I'm going home

05:24.725 --> 05:26.360
-and I'm going to hit you.
-Whatever.

05:26.459 --> 05:28.461
[Leah] And the winner obviously
was Kendal.

05:28.562 --> 05:31.464
Now I have a ten-year-old son

05:31.564 --> 05:34.401
who is absolutely darling
and impeccably mannered.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.336
I am a single mother.

05:36.437 --> 05:40.540
I feel like I need
to let the new Leah shine

05:40.641 --> 05:42.141
because I'm proud
of the progress

05:42.242 --> 05:43.810
that I've made as an adult.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.245
-Mr. Gauntlet, right?
What's up, man?
-Yeah.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.415
You're growing the hair out,
huh?

05:49.348 --> 05:51.084
-Oh, I know.
-20 years?

05:51.183 --> 05:54.954
[Katie] Steve is from my season
of Road Rules: The Quest.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.524
[screaming]

05:57.625 --> 06:02.228
[cheering]

06:04.964 --> 06:07.500
And they'll tell you 52 times
he looks like Jason Momoa,

06:07.600 --> 06:08.968
but I don't see it at all.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.269
[dolphin squeaks]

06:10.370 --> 06:11.704
-[overlapping chatter]
-Cheers, brother.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.040
[Steve]
For all the Modelo commercials,

06:14.141 --> 06:15.208
I'm the hand that pops the...

06:15.307 --> 06:16.677
-Are you, really?
-Are you serious?

06:16.776 --> 06:18.411
-Yeah.
-You guys,
we have a celebrity here.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.579
[Tina] Show us. I want
to see it. How do you do it?

06:19.680 --> 06:20.781
I want to see it.
I want to see it.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.382
I want to see it. I want
to see it.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.750
-I want to see it!
-For the last 12 years,

06:23.850 --> 06:26.620
I have been a successful
professional hand model.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.356
["Oh Yeah" by Yello playing]

06:30.457 --> 06:32.324
You have to, like,
pop it off like that.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.060
And then you do it
like 10, 15 times.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.497
They are quite beautiful
if you look at them closely.

06:36.596 --> 06:39.899
-[MJ] Teck Money!
-What up, MJ, what's up, man?!

06:40.000 --> 06:41.735
-[MJ] How you doing, man?
-So good to see you.

06:41.834 --> 06:42.935
What's up?

06:43.036 --> 06:45.137
What up, you big country boy,
you?

06:45.237 --> 06:47.841
Last season was the first season
of The Challenge: All Stars.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.610
I got eliminated on the third
challenge by Nehemiah.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.680
So I'm back,
back for redemption.

06:52.779 --> 06:56.249
I needed to come
and do this again, prove myself.

06:56.348 --> 06:57.550
You look wonderful, man.

06:57.651 --> 06:58.819
Thank you, man.
Appreciate it, man.

06:58.918 --> 06:59.920
You got that Pepto-Bismol
coming out.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.355
'Cause I'm the shit.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.425
-[yells]
-[all laughing]

07:06.627 --> 07:07.894
Why am I an all-star?

07:07.995 --> 07:09.129
'Cause I'm Teck Money, baby.

07:09.228 --> 07:11.430
I got the looks.
I got the brain.

07:11.531 --> 07:12.865
I got the gift of gab.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.735
I'm like Amazon, you know,
the total package.

07:15.836 --> 07:19.540
[laughing]

07:19.639 --> 07:23.610
[Nehemiah]
Ayanna in the house. What's up?

07:23.711 --> 07:26.547
The last time I was in front
of you guys,

07:26.646 --> 07:30.550
I was sleeping in my uniform
because I wanted to win.

07:31.317 --> 07:34.221
I want to say my piece.
Excuse me.

07:34.721 --> 07:38.457
I slept in my uniform last night
'cause I wanted to win today.

07:38.558 --> 07:41.528
But nobody stepped up today.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.564
Nobody stepped
the [bleep] up today.

07:43.663 --> 07:46.033
Sometimes in life,
you wish you'd get a do-over,

07:46.132 --> 07:48.468
and this feels like that.

07:48.569 --> 07:49.937
I'm a mom of four.

07:50.036 --> 07:51.904
I have two teenagers
and two toddlers.

07:52.004 --> 07:54.542
We've had a lot of adversity
as a family.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.509
I'm doing this for us.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.446
I haven't seen you
in a minute, girl.

07:59.547 --> 08:00.880
[Ayanna]
How have you been?

08:00.980 --> 08:03.415
I know Ayanna
from Battle of the Sexes 2.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.252
Just kind of clicked.
She was cool.

08:05.351 --> 08:06.954
We had fun. We laughed a lot.

08:07.053 --> 08:08.454
I now live in Jersey City.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.723
Right before the pandemic,
I gave my resignation

08:10.824 --> 08:12.759
to a company
that I worked for for 20 years

08:12.860 --> 08:14.927
because I wanted
to change my life.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.497
And a few months later,
all of a sudden,

08:17.598 --> 08:19.132
we're doing
All Star Challenges.

08:19.231 --> 08:22.168
So I feel like I'm starting
the second half of my life.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.470
[Jonna]
I can't believe this.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.137
When's the last time
you did a show?

08:25.237 --> 08:26.807
-Like your last Challenge.
-I don't know, you tell me.

08:26.906 --> 08:29.375
Well, I saw you as a mercenary.

08:29.475 --> 08:31.077
Right?
You walked in, like, with CT.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.648
Oh, we were like heavy-hitters.
That was the last time I was on.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.549
I brought a couple
heavy-hitters from back home.

08:36.649 --> 08:38.485
And I think you guys
might know these people.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.287
[man 5] Uh-oh. Oh!

08:40.386 --> 08:42.355
[woman 4]
That's CT and Tina!

08:43.691 --> 08:45.392
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

08:46.726 --> 08:48.796
-Oh, you're so sweet.
-It's really cool.

08:48.895 --> 08:50.496
Thank you.

08:50.597 --> 08:52.633
[Jonna] Part of my strategy
is playing the social game.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.768
I'm trying to make
as many friends as possible.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.436
I feel like people like Tina

08:56.536 --> 08:57.904
like to be showered
with compliments.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.173
So, you know,
it may be good for my game.

09:00.273 --> 09:03.844
I've heard crazy things
that it's very different.

09:03.943 --> 09:05.144
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

09:05.613 --> 09:06.513
I don't know.

09:06.614 --> 09:07.980
If they say Cutthroat,

09:08.081 --> 09:09.649
-I'm definitely Cutthroat.
-[glasses clanking]

09:11.551 --> 09:12.686
Someone's going to get cut.

09:13.285 --> 09:16.423
* It sure is hot out here
You know *

09:17.024 --> 09:18.759
* Know what I'm saying? Uh *

09:18.859 --> 09:21.494
* Take the shackles off my feet
So I can dance *

09:21.595 --> 09:24.463
-Look at TJ.
-[TJ] What up, guys?

09:24.563 --> 09:26.499
[all cheering]

09:30.136 --> 09:32.072
What's up, TJ?

09:34.506 --> 09:36.442
[TJ] I know that some of you
have been waiting

09:36.543 --> 09:39.111
a really, really long time
to be here.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.447
So let's just get right
down to it.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.182
[Darren] TJ pulls up.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.851
Swagged out like we on vacation.

09:44.951 --> 09:46.820
But this ain't no
goddamn vacation.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.254
* I'm gonna praise you *

09:48.355 --> 09:49.588
All right, everyone.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.158
I want you to take
a look around.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.159
Each and every one of you

09:53.259 --> 09:55.796
has a serious past here
on The Challenge.

09:55.895 --> 09:58.398
Some of you
are Challenge champions.

09:59.365 --> 10:00.734
Some of you seek redemption.

10:01.368 --> 10:04.837
And some of you have yet
to capture that elusive victory.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.006
Some of you might be snakes

10:07.106 --> 10:10.576
or a politician
or might be Challenge beasts.

10:11.177 --> 10:15.816
But one thing's for sure,
you can never outrun your past.

10:15.916 --> 10:19.418
So be ready for anything
at any time.

10:19.519 --> 10:22.088
Welcome to The Challenge:
All Stars.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.527
[cheering and applauding]

10:28.729 --> 10:30.864
Now it's called
that for a reason.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.265
I'm looking at a bunch
of all-stars.

10:33.365 --> 10:34.701
First challenge is no joke.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.469
Go get moved in.
I'll see you soon.

10:36.568 --> 10:40.139
* *

10:41.573 --> 10:43.610
Last season, we bumped it up
another level.

10:43.711 --> 10:46.645
I hope this season, it's taken
a couple more levels up.

10:46.746 --> 10:49.649
I'm looking forward
to badass competitions,

10:49.750 --> 10:53.153
awesome eliminations,
epic moments.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.754
So get ready.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.965
["Cum On Feel the Noize"
by Quiet Riot playing]

11:05.065 --> 11:08.235
* Come on, feel the noise *

11:08.335 --> 11:11.138
-* Girls, rock your boys *
-[men cheering]

11:11.238 --> 11:13.139
* We'll get wild, wild, wild *

11:13.240 --> 11:14.307
How do we get
in this motherfucker?

11:14.407 --> 11:15.908
-Careful.
-Don't break an ankle.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.177
* Wild, wild, wild *

11:18.278 --> 11:19.712
Where is the bar?

11:19.812 --> 11:22.448
* So you think
I got an evil mind? *

11:22.548 --> 11:25.317
* I'll tell you, honey *

11:25.418 --> 11:28.587
-[woman screams]
-* I don't know why *

11:28.687 --> 11:30.990
-You've got a window?
-We're all out. We're out...

11:31.091 --> 11:32.459
We're gonna do great
this season, guys.

11:32.558 --> 11:34.427
That was my cardio for the day,
ladies.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.029
-Is that real?
-Yeah, there's two beds.

11:37.129 --> 11:38.999
[cheering]

11:39.099 --> 11:41.400
[Casey] There have been
so many people that have said

11:41.500 --> 11:44.071
I'm one of the worst
Challengers ever.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.639
-[man 6] Come on, Casey.
-All right, Casey.

11:46.740 --> 11:50.744
I'm perfectly capable
of just jumping four stories.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.412
[man 7] It's four stories
in the water.

11:52.511 --> 11:53.846
[Casey] I'm not doing that.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.514
-[Casey] I know. I'm so sorry.
-[man 7] Okay.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.750
[Casey]
I am dying for redemption.

11:57.850 --> 12:02.154
There is so much more to me
than being afraid to do heights.

12:02.254 --> 12:05.625
I am coming into this
as a 34-year-old woman,

12:05.725 --> 12:06.692
an accountant.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.128
I am recently engaged.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.596
Just want
to set the record straight

12:09.696 --> 12:12.698
and say,
you ain't seen nothing yet.

12:13.365 --> 12:14.967
Hey, roomie, I'm going
to get you a drink.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.903
Oh, let's get a cocktail,
ladies.

12:17.004 --> 12:19.272
[woman cheering]

12:19.371 --> 12:21.474
* Girls, rock your boys *

12:21.573 --> 12:23.442
[Katie] I thought they
were all bunk beds.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.346
All right.
Who cleaned the bunk bedroom?

12:26.446 --> 12:28.548
Last season I was hoping
for a little vacation.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.616
This season,
I am ready to compete.

12:30.716 --> 12:32.251
I have been working out.

12:32.351 --> 12:35.687
I have been practicing
endurance, stability, balance.

12:35.788 --> 12:38.357
Three things that I think
cost me my win last season.

12:38.457 --> 12:40.626
[man 8] Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, get as much flex.

12:40.726 --> 12:42.830
[woman 5] Katie, why don't you
do something?

12:42.929 --> 12:45.565
[disgruntled voice]

12:45.664 --> 12:46.732
Shit.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.467
[Katie]
I am happily married

12:48.567 --> 12:50.236
and we have a six-year-old
daughter, Avery.

12:50.336 --> 12:54.274
I work in finance
for a media production company.

12:54.374 --> 12:55.975
And I love decorating.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.543
* Come on, feel the noise *

12:57.644 --> 12:59.312
[MJ]
Dude, there is a gym.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.249
Hey, look at this little
bitty barbell. [chuckles]

13:02.349 --> 13:05.652
Last Challenge I was on
was The Duel 2 in New Zealand.

13:05.751 --> 13:08.355
My oldest daughter
was only two years old.

13:08.455 --> 13:12.292
It's pretty awesome now
that she's 14 years old

13:12.392 --> 13:14.360
to see her dad compete.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.763
The game's changed a lot.
It's much more intense.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.832
I know my biggest strength
is going to be my sheer size

13:19.932 --> 13:21.533
and my athletic ability,

13:21.634 --> 13:24.537
but my goal is to show my kids
that daddy can still kick ass.

13:24.636 --> 13:28.075
Cohutta, you can...
sit here and do your flies.

13:28.174 --> 13:30.610
-I can do these.
-[laughing]

13:30.710 --> 13:33.346
I think my lifestyle at home
is probably a lot different

13:33.446 --> 13:35.148
than a lot of people here.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.283
I'm a general contractor
in Montana.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.784
I have a very serious girlfriend

13:38.885 --> 13:40.552
and we live together
in a log cabin

13:40.653 --> 13:43.990
on about a 60- or 70-acre
sheep farm.

13:44.091 --> 13:46.393
My home looks like
a Christmas card.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.996
I pretty much live
in a Hallmark advertisement,

13:50.096 --> 13:51.364
you know, every day.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.100
Yeah.

13:54.201 --> 13:57.669
The last season that I did
was All Stars, season one.

13:57.769 --> 14:00.506
And was a little devastated

14:00.606 --> 14:03.910
to go home
right before the final.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.145
[TJ] This ends your time here
on The Challenge.

14:06.245 --> 14:07.846
[Kendal] I just wanted
to make my boys proud.

14:07.947 --> 14:11.618
And I did that.
They cried when I went home.

14:11.717 --> 14:14.553
And so, this time
I want to make sure

14:14.653 --> 14:16.556
that there's only tears of joy.

14:16.655 --> 14:19.759
And maybe make some
of those dreams come true.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.830
[indistinct chatter]

14:23.931 --> 14:25.432
All right, everybody. So.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.936
TJ Lavin, the man,
the myth, the legend,

14:29.036 --> 14:31.571
wanted me just to give
a very small welcome toast

14:31.671 --> 14:33.373
in honor
since he couldn't be here.

14:33.472 --> 14:35.774
TJ did have a dream...

14:36.709 --> 14:39.846
to bring all of our old asses
back on the TV screens.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.880
[woman screams]

14:41.981 --> 14:44.384
The last Challenge
that you saw me on

14:44.484 --> 14:47.153
was the All Stars season one.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.990
And I made it all the way
until the day before the final.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.961
Every single thing that I did
came back to haunt me.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.963
This time around it's going to
be a whole different ball game.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.365
I'm known for being zen,

14:58.465 --> 15:00.667
and I'm known for being
a nice guy.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.669
Unfortunately, that has only
got me to the final one time.

15:03.769 --> 15:07.240
So now we raise a toast
since season one is in the bag.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.376
Season two will be the best
Challenge that they ever had.

15:10.476 --> 15:13.312
[all cheering]

15:13.413 --> 15:16.048
Yeah.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.817
-[woman 6] Go, baby.
-Can I piss in the pool now?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.586
-Let's piss in the pool.
-Teck Money.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.654
It's Teck Money.
The party starter.

15:22.754 --> 15:24.423
Call me when you want
the party started.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.658
Here we go.

15:26.759 --> 15:27.793
-* What you doing? *
-* Nothing *

15:27.894 --> 15:29.729
* Chillin' at the Holiday Inn *

15:29.828 --> 15:31.530
-* Who you with? *
-* Me and my peeps *

15:31.630 --> 15:32.532
* Won't you bring
Four of your friends *

15:32.631 --> 15:34.100
[Ayanna] No disrespect,

15:34.201 --> 15:37.437
but sometimes a queen has
to admit when she sees a king.

15:37.537 --> 15:41.941
He pulls off his kingly garments

15:42.042 --> 15:44.543
and lets the scepter hang.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.178
That was a sight to see.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.480
* Feel on each other
And sip on some Hen *

15:48.581 --> 15:50.049
* One thing leadin' to another *

15:50.149 --> 15:51.650
* Let the party begin *

15:51.750 --> 15:54.020
* Stop, drop, kaboom
Baby, rub on your ... *

15:54.120 --> 15:57.323
* Some call me Ludacris
Some call me Mr. Wiggles *

15:57.423 --> 15:59.025
[Melinda] I really feel like
I have something to prove.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.629
I'm ready to show the world
that I can kick some ass

16:02.729 --> 16:04.998
and be tough and win
one of these things.

16:05.097 --> 16:06.599
When I was in my 20s,

16:06.698 --> 16:09.101
I really didn't take a lot
of things seriously

16:09.201 --> 16:10.602
and now that I'm in my 30s,

16:10.702 --> 16:14.907
I am married and I have
a 21-month-year-old son.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.509
I am happy with who I am,

16:17.610 --> 16:19.412
stronger mentally,
stronger physically.

16:19.511 --> 16:23.149
[cheering]

16:23.250 --> 16:24.317
So I'm ready to bring it.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.153
* One thing leadin' to another *

16:26.253 --> 16:27.153
* Let the party begin *

16:27.254 --> 16:29.855
[laughter]

16:29.956 --> 16:31.191
-[Darrell] Truly.
-[Derrick] Cheers.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.558
Cheers.

16:33.559 --> 16:35.028
To a great season, gentlemen.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.864
You're clearly like
the strongest girl here.

16:38.431 --> 16:42.000
You, Kendal, probably Janelle,
Katie.

16:42.101 --> 16:43.936
That's what I'm looking at now.
That's what I'm seeing now.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.605
Maybe Sophia.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.740
That's my thing, like, I know
a decent amount of people here,

16:47.840 --> 16:49.408
-like, know of them
or have like...
-[Derrick] Yeah.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.711
...been friendly with them, but,
like, I don't know them enough

16:52.812 --> 16:54.647
to, like, have them be
on my team or anything,

16:54.746 --> 16:56.216
-you know what I mean?
-[Derrick] Right. Yeah.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.918
And probably like alliances
have already like began

16:59.018 --> 16:59.918
and stuff like that.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.254
I've won three times.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.289
I might be the baddest
motherfucker

17:03.389 --> 17:04.356
that's ever played this game.

17:04.457 --> 17:05.758
Sorry, I'm not sorry.

17:05.857 --> 17:07.960
I want to run this damn
thing with Jodi.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.695
-We started Road Rules
together.
-[Jodi] Yeah!

17:09.796 --> 17:11.864
Nailed it on the first try.

17:11.963 --> 17:14.134
I want to get a Challenge
championship with this girl.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.568
Unless there's like a safety
to win or something,

17:16.669 --> 17:18.238
like, everybody's free game,
you know.

17:18.337 --> 17:20.339
And you don't know what
the elimination things

17:20.440 --> 17:22.375
-are going to be.
-No, we don't. We don't.

17:22.474 --> 17:23.509
That's just the way it works.

17:23.609 --> 17:24.576
* *

17:24.676 --> 17:26.645
This is beautiful.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.148
This season, I'm definitely
more intimidated

17:29.249 --> 17:30.583
walking into this one

17:30.682 --> 17:31.983
just by, like, all the people
who are here.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.520
Yeah. You were like a beast
on that last one.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.323
I was like,
this chick just had a baby

17:36.423 --> 17:37.990
and she came up a mountain.

17:38.090 --> 17:41.794
On All Stars, I feel like
I did the best I've ever done.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.963
-I got third place.
-[men] Jonna all day!

17:45.064 --> 17:47.134
[cheering]

17:47.233 --> 17:48.934
[Jonna]
I left my two kids behind.

17:49.035 --> 17:52.138
I have a five-year-old
and a one-year-old.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.772
And if I'm going
to take the time

17:53.873 --> 17:55.241
to be away from my family,

17:55.342 --> 17:57.876
you better believe
that I'm coming here to win.

17:57.977 --> 18:00.747
[Jonna] Last season, I, like,
slid, like, under the radar.

18:00.846 --> 18:02.848
But I feel like I can't play
that game again, so.

18:02.949 --> 18:05.017
When's the last time
you did a show?

18:06.318 --> 18:07.886
-17 years ago.
-[Jonna] What?

18:07.987 --> 18:10.757
-Which one?
-Yeah, man.
Battle of the Sexes 2.

18:10.856 --> 18:12.692
It was good. That's where
I met actually Ayanna

18:12.791 --> 18:14.560
and I haven't seen her since.
How about you?

18:14.661 --> 18:17.230
I have Derek and Jasmine
both here for my season.

18:17.329 --> 18:19.097
[Sophia] When was the last time
you saw them?

18:19.199 --> 18:21.867
[Jonna] Well, Derek came
to my wedding three years ago.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.803
It's been a long time
since I've seen Jasmine.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.071
[Sophia] I heard you guys were
beefing and now you're friends?

18:26.173 --> 18:27.773
Yep. We used to be rivals.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.942
So it's going to be interesting
to see, like, what it's like

18:30.041 --> 18:31.711
to have people here
who I actually, like, left.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.579
-Oh, that is true.
-Yeah.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.582
-Oh, that's a whole different
ball game.
-Whole different game.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.349
It's trippy.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.652
-It feels good.
-[stammers] You just walk

18:39.751 --> 18:40.987
-around with the bottle.
-It feels good. It feels good.

18:41.086 --> 18:42.422
It feels good to see
all you guys.

18:42.521 --> 18:45.458
I mean, so am I, but... [laughs]

18:48.560 --> 18:50.563
On this first season
of the All Stars,

18:50.663 --> 18:52.932
I did not make it to the final.

18:53.031 --> 18:55.167
I've thought
about my elimination

18:55.268 --> 18:57.769
and that Challenge
every single day.

18:57.869 --> 19:00.339
I'm playing for my future.

19:00.440 --> 19:04.009
I just recently fell in love
with a wonderful woman.

19:04.109 --> 19:07.579
Before season one, it was
18 years in between Challenges.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.848
And honestly,
I'm still the same guy.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.451
I want to compete.
I'm super intense.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.186
And I want to win.

19:14.287 --> 19:17.490
[cheering]

19:17.589 --> 19:19.025
[Tina]
Leah, why don't you do it?

19:19.125 --> 19:21.728
-Do it. Do it. Do it.
-Yes.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.363
I'm not wearing a bra.

19:23.462 --> 19:24.696
That's the point, bitch.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.598
-That's the point.
-You are so--

19:26.699 --> 19:28.034
[man 9] Leah, do it
for all the single ladies.

19:28.134 --> 19:31.037
Okay, listen. This is...
Listen, you're single--

19:31.136 --> 19:32.739
Are you... Stop.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.507
Who's going to pay
for my dry cleaning?

19:34.606 --> 19:36.075
-Nobody. Go.
-Then, no.

19:36.174 --> 19:37.809
-Do you know what this is?
-Silk.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.179
-Yeah.
-Okay. Well, then strip it off.
Go.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.682
[Janelle] Isn't this crazy?
I never would have imagined

19:42.781 --> 19:44.083
we'd be doing a Challenge.

19:44.182 --> 19:45.551
I know, right?

19:45.652 --> 19:49.087
Nobody knows we know
each other from back way when.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.923
-It's crazy.
-So do we say something

19:51.022 --> 19:52.525
-or do we not say now?
-Nah, don't say nothing.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.759
Okay.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.027
Me and Janelle
from the Bay Area.

19:55.126 --> 19:56.563
We used to go
to parties together

19:56.663 --> 19:58.029
and we've known each other
for a long time.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.598
A lot of people don't know that
in this house

19:59.699 --> 20:00.666
and we're going
to keep it that way.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.167
Nobody need to know all that.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.502
People don't understand

20:03.603 --> 20:05.171
the Bay Area
is a different breed, man.

20:05.271 --> 20:07.173
-There's just something
about it.
-I agree with that.

20:07.273 --> 20:10.442
I won my first Challenge
which was Inferno 3.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.544
[Darrell] We won, right?

20:11.644 --> 20:12.744
[Janelle]
We won $10,000...

20:12.845 --> 20:13.813
[Darrell]
10 grand, baby.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.315
I am currently a surgical nurse.

20:15.414 --> 20:18.351
I have an amazing
supportive husband

20:18.451 --> 20:20.586
and two beautiful amazing kids.

20:20.686 --> 20:22.489
And they're just my joy.

20:22.588 --> 20:23.990
I have literally dedicated

20:24.089 --> 20:27.159
the past three and a half years
to my children.

20:27.259 --> 20:29.596
And now I feel like
this is an opportunity

20:29.695 --> 20:32.565
to dedicate a little bit
of this time to me.

20:32.664 --> 20:34.534
* *

20:34.634 --> 20:38.570
Hi. I need to do an appointment
at Designs by Jonna.

20:38.671 --> 20:39.872
[Jonna laughs]

20:39.971 --> 20:41.708
I have aged,
but I haven't grown up.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.411
I'm still the same playful
Derek that you guys know.

20:44.510 --> 20:47.078
My original season
was Real World: CancÃºn.

20:47.179 --> 20:50.450
We started our journey together
in this spot 11 years ago.

20:50.549 --> 20:54.287
I've got Jonna, I've got Jasmine
and I hope that we kick ass.

20:54.386 --> 20:57.523
I'm pretty booked tomorrow,
because I have a lot of...

20:57.624 --> 20:58.758
-[Derek] Booked?
-...appointments.

20:58.857 --> 21:00.826
But for you
and this beautiful hair,

21:00.926 --> 21:02.161
I can probably squeeze you in.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.830
[Jasmine]
I am so happy to see Jonna,

21:04.931 --> 21:08.166
my partner in crime
since the beginning.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.337
We have gone through
such a roller coaster together.

21:11.438 --> 21:16.174
But now that we're both moms
and wives, we are a unit.

21:16.275 --> 21:20.313
I know if anything in this game,
Derek and Jonna have my back.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.048
Her name is Anit.

21:22.147 --> 21:23.482
[Tina]
My name's spelled backwards.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.250
-Anit.
-Anit. Anit.

21:25.352 --> 21:26.885
Obviously,
there's only one Tina.

21:26.986 --> 21:30.323
So I am Anit.
I am Tina's other half.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.324
-[Tina snorts]
-Oh.

21:31.423 --> 21:32.325
Oh, I snort...

21:32.424 --> 21:33.826
I know, right?

21:33.925 --> 21:35.227
[Derek] This is what you look
like after the...

21:35.327 --> 21:38.197
Yeah... wilted,
hot pink, reddish flowers.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.932
-Do me proud, darling.
-I will, girl.

21:40.031 --> 21:42.368
I'm gonna, I'm gonna...
I'm giving you my crown.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.570
[Derek] What the fuck!

21:44.671 --> 21:46.873
[women screaming]

21:46.972 --> 21:49.375
[Derek] I want
a cold room, bitch.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.810
If I'm going to be
impersonating somebody,

21:51.911 --> 21:53.846
it might as well be one
of the strongest girls

21:53.945 --> 21:55.013
in the house, right?

21:55.114 --> 21:56.648
* We come together *

21:56.749 --> 21:59.419
* 'Cause opposites attract
And you know *

21:59.519 --> 22:02.288
[Tina] Don't fucking give me
competition, bitch.

22:02.388 --> 22:05.392
* *

22:17.604 --> 22:20.606
[grunting]

22:20.707 --> 22:22.208
[Nehemiah] You ready? You ready?

22:22.307 --> 22:23.910
[Derrick] Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.978
Please don't hurt me.
Please, no.

22:26.077 --> 22:29.548
Last season, I thought
Nehemiah hated my guts.

22:29.648 --> 22:33.519
I put him into elimination
which ended up sending him home.

22:33.619 --> 22:35.054
My vote's for Nehemiah.

22:35.153 --> 22:36.823
I don't hate Nehemiah.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.657
We just have
an awkward relationship.

22:38.758 --> 22:39.858
I'm sorry. Please don't hurt me.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.259
This is what you made.

22:41.359 --> 22:42.795
Look me in the eye.
This is what you made.

22:42.894 --> 22:44.029
Please,
I can't look you in the eye.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.096
-Look me in the eye.
-I'm too scared.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.499
Derrick is intimidated by me.

22:46.598 --> 22:48.067
I don't have anything
against the guy.

22:48.166 --> 22:49.736
But, apparently,
he has something against me.

22:49.836 --> 22:52.838
Is he going to play
an honest game?

22:52.939 --> 22:55.541
I don't really trust him.
He can be shady.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.343
Suck on that, punk.

22:59.377 --> 23:02.381
* *

23:06.752 --> 23:08.019
[Jasmine]
It's nerve-racking.

23:08.119 --> 23:10.221
The butterflies
are starting to kick in.

23:10.321 --> 23:13.025
The feeling of can I do this,
can I not do this,

23:13.125 --> 23:14.359
am I too old for this?
Oh, my God.

23:14.461 --> 23:15.795
What if I break a hip?

23:15.894 --> 23:17.430
Is my insurance
going to cover all of this?

23:17.529 --> 23:18.897
I'm fucking scared.

23:19.665 --> 23:21.601
Obviously, nerves are high.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.234
I got butterflies in my stomach.

23:23.335 --> 23:25.070
I don't even know what I'm
getting myself into right now.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.940
It's been so long
since I've actually done

23:28.039 --> 23:29.976
any sort of physical challenges.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.411
This is my first Challenge
in seven years.

23:32.511 --> 23:33.712
They're just going to, like,

23:33.813 --> 23:35.114
do something crazy
right off the bat.

23:35.213 --> 23:36.482
[Tina]
Holy shit.

23:36.583 --> 23:39.151
PTSD overload.

23:39.250 --> 23:44.656
My anxiety is pretty much
steaming out my ears

23:44.757 --> 23:46.593
and I am scared.

23:46.692 --> 23:49.127
* *

23:54.133 --> 23:57.769
* *

24:14.886 --> 24:16.087
[TJ]
All right, everyone.

24:16.188 --> 24:17.455
Welcome to your first challenge

24:17.557 --> 24:19.090
here on this season
of All Stars.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.727
[cheering]

24:20.826 --> 24:22.628
All right.

24:23.596 --> 24:25.030
Before we get started,

24:25.131 --> 24:27.199
I'll be telling you
what this badass Challenge

24:27.298 --> 24:28.233
is going to be about.

24:28.334 --> 24:29.669
Let's start with money.

24:29.769 --> 24:32.572
-Yes.
-Yes. That's the most important.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.141
[TJ] This season of
The Challenge: All Stars

24:35.240 --> 24:38.978
is worth $500,000.

24:39.077 --> 24:41.681
[all cheering]

24:43.915 --> 24:46.853
Back in my 20s,
I may have taken that to Vegas

24:46.952 --> 24:49.188
and spent a couple weeks
having a good time.

24:49.288 --> 24:51.457
Today, we all have families,

24:51.557 --> 24:54.292
we all have big responsibilities
in our lives.

24:54.393 --> 24:55.827
Winning $500,000 now

24:55.927 --> 24:58.964
is going to make each one
of these adults

24:59.065 --> 25:02.734
more cutthroat
than they ever have been before.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.270
Now, each challenge day
there will be two winners.

25:05.371 --> 25:07.773
One man and one woman.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.541
Sometimes you'll be playing
as teams.

25:09.642 --> 25:11.911
Sometimes you'll be playing
as pairs.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.180
And sometimes
you got to go at it alone.

25:15.080 --> 25:19.786
Now, on the team and pair days,
you will be choosing your teams.

25:19.885 --> 25:21.487
Ugh.

25:21.587 --> 25:23.789
Now, this is where your past

25:23.890 --> 25:25.758
could either help you
or hurt you.

25:25.857 --> 25:28.394
Hopefully, it helps you
and, if it doesn't,

25:28.493 --> 25:30.496
this could be your chance
for redemption.

25:30.596 --> 25:32.298
Now for today's challenge,

25:32.397 --> 25:33.932
you are going to be playing
in pairs.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.534
So go ahead and knock
that out for me.

25:35.634 --> 25:38.136
-Nehemiah.
-[Ayanna] That's it.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.505
Let's go.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.509
I look at Nehemiah
and he goes like this.

25:44.343 --> 25:46.679
Oh, Nehemiah doesn't even want
to fucking pair with me?

25:46.778 --> 25:48.079
I know you fucking heard me.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.781
All right. Steve?

25:49.882 --> 25:51.817
Steve is standing there.
No one's picking him.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.219
So, Steve it is.

25:53.318 --> 25:54.753
We have a great dynamic.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.155
He knows when to shut up,
and I don't.

25:57.256 --> 25:58.691
What am I doing here?

25:58.790 --> 25:59.925
-Let's go, Road Rules.
-Let's do it.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.428
You came and asked first.
Got you.

26:02.528 --> 26:04.462
I turn around
and I see Laterrian.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.732
He's a gentleman
and he's a great guy.

26:06.833 --> 26:09.201
If he is your partner,

26:09.300 --> 26:12.503
you are so bloody lucky

26:12.605 --> 26:14.073
because he's great in every way.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.909
All right. Today's challenge
is called Boarding Party.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.111
* *

26:19.211 --> 26:21.512
Now as you can see, there are
two badass boats out here

26:21.614 --> 26:23.249
connected by a bridge.

26:23.348 --> 26:26.919
To begin, you and your partner
are going to start on a zodiac.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.220
* *

26:28.319 --> 26:30.256
You're going to haul ass off
that zodiac

26:30.355 --> 26:31.790
jumping onto the first boat.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.424
You will then grab a skull,

26:33.525 --> 26:36.394
race that skull
across that balance beam

26:36.494 --> 26:37.997
to the second boat

26:38.096 --> 26:40.866
where you then run to the front
and take a leap of faith,

26:40.967 --> 26:42.801
jumping off the front
of that boat

26:42.902 --> 26:47.138
and slam-dunking your skull
into a basket.

26:47.239 --> 26:49.075
[all cheering]

26:49.174 --> 26:51.309
[applauding]

26:51.410 --> 26:52.711
This is a timed event.

26:52.811 --> 26:54.913
Get it done as fast as you can,

26:55.013 --> 26:57.482
because the team
with the fastest time

26:57.583 --> 26:59.018
will be our winners.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.086
Now, the winning team
will have all the power.

27:01.186 --> 27:03.454
And I'll tell you
all about that later.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.791
The team to get this done
the slowest,

27:05.892 --> 27:09.461
well, if I was you,
let's just say, I would win.

27:09.961 --> 27:12.163
All right? Good luck, everyone.

27:12.263 --> 27:14.066
Yay!

27:14.165 --> 27:17.303
* *

27:17.403 --> 27:19.637
See you later.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.807
[cheering]

27:21.907 --> 27:23.209
-She's a mom of two now.
-I know.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.810
-Like, my kids--
-I'm 40.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.412
My kids are going to be
so excited to see me do this.

27:26.511 --> 27:28.881
Even my husband, like, and
we're, like, boat yachty people,

27:28.980 --> 27:31.250
like, and I get to do
boat yachty stuff.

27:31.349 --> 27:32.483
Like, I'm excited.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.119
-Yachty, yachty.
-Yachty, yachty.

27:34.220 --> 27:37.655
* *

27:37.757 --> 27:42.894
The last time you guys saw me
was Fresh Meat II, 2010-ish.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.462
* *

27:44.563 --> 27:47.499
Currently my pipe dream
is to move to Austin, Texas,

27:47.598 --> 27:50.201
get a backyard
and a dog, and a man.

27:50.301 --> 27:52.538
Not only am I playing
this game for me,

27:52.637 --> 27:54.605
but I'm playing it
for my nonexistent dog

27:54.707 --> 27:57.143
and my future
nonexistent husband.

27:57.743 --> 27:59.478
-Go!

27:59.577 --> 28:03.950
-* *
-[cheering]

28:15.961 --> 28:18.064
[Tina] How many more teams left
that needs to go?

28:18.163 --> 28:21.768
-* Creep *
-* Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I *

28:21.867 --> 28:24.236
Yes, America.
That is full speed.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.503
This is not slow motion.

28:25.604 --> 28:27.038
* Oh, I *

28:27.138 --> 28:28.374
-* Yeah *
-* I creep *

28:28.473 --> 28:29.909
I know we look a little slow.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.978
So you're going to see
the old folks convalescent home,

28:32.077 --> 28:34.012
just scoot across on our ass.

28:34.113 --> 28:36.682
* So I creep, yeah *

28:36.782 --> 28:39.151
[woman 7] Keep worming it.
Keep worming it.

28:39.250 --> 28:43.221
* Said nobody is supposed
to know *

28:43.322 --> 28:44.722
Oh, shit. They're going.

28:44.824 --> 28:48.294
* *

28:56.234 --> 28:59.038
[bell chimes]

28:59.137 --> 29:02.240

29:10.682 --> 29:13.519
-[bell chimes]
-Yeah.

29:13.618 --> 29:16.221
Yes! I did it!
[screaming]

29:17.123 --> 29:19.357
-Happy tears. Happy tears.
-Oh, yeah.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.292
-Oh, my God.
-[Ryan] So proud of this one.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.362
Showing you that moms
can do all the things.

29:23.461 --> 29:24.931
Moms can still do it, you know,

29:25.030 --> 29:28.067
like, I've been gone for
seven years and I still got it.

29:28.166 --> 29:30.236
I still got that heart.
I'm never going to give up.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.702
This bitch slam-dunks.

29:31.804 --> 29:34.173
-Was easy. Can I do that again?
-Yeah, it was fun.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.476
[Derrick]
All right. Let's do this shit.

29:37.576 --> 29:38.644
[Jodi]
All right.

29:38.743 --> 29:40.078
Grab the skulls. Put it in.

29:40.179 --> 29:41.779
* *

29:41.881 --> 29:45.451
I'm so happy to be reunited with
my Road Rules: X-Treme teammate.

29:45.550 --> 29:48.420
I'm glad that we may
actually find redemption.

29:48.519 --> 29:50.088
We did one challenge
back on The Duel

29:50.189 --> 29:51.757
that I disqualified us on.

29:51.857 --> 29:54.292
-[group groans]
-[horn blares]

29:54.393 --> 29:57.096
The plan today is to dominate
the competition.

29:57.195 --> 29:58.797
I'm going to be
the fastest guy today.

29:58.897 --> 30:00.298
She's going to be
the fastest girl

30:00.398 --> 30:01.767
and they're all going
to be scared.

30:01.867 --> 30:03.169
-Boom.
-Boom.

30:03.869 --> 30:05.171
-This is awesome.
-[Derrick] Yeah.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.140
-Are you ready? Go.
-[horn blares]

30:23.489 --> 30:25.757
* Booty, booty, booty, booty
Rockin' everywhere *

30:25.857 --> 30:28.359
* Booty, booty, booty
Booty rockin' everywhere *

30:28.460 --> 30:30.962
* Rockin' everywhere
Rockin' everywhere *

30:31.063 --> 30:33.632
* I found you, Ms. New Booty *

30:34.665 --> 30:37.269
[Derrick] I naturally feel like
Jodi's already my teammate

30:37.368 --> 30:40.906
and I haven't seen her
in like 15, 16 years.

30:41.007 --> 30:43.375
* I found you, Ms. New Booty *

30:43.474 --> 30:45.777
* Get it together
And bring it back to me *

30:45.877 --> 30:48.713
That was quick.
That was hella quick.

30:48.814 --> 30:50.848
[both cheering]

30:51.282 --> 30:52.884
[Tina]
Just like in the old days,

30:52.984 --> 30:55.954
Derrick and Jodi are a force
to be reckoned with.

30:56.721 --> 30:57.823
I'm like, shit.

30:57.923 --> 30:59.290
That's definitely a team

30:59.391 --> 31:01.359
that's going to be running
this game.

31:02.894 --> 31:05.396
All right.
Next up, Nehemiah and Ayanna.

31:05.497 --> 31:08.700
[Ayanna screaming]

31:08.799 --> 31:10.970
-We gonna set this tone.
-Yes.

31:11.069 --> 31:12.104
[Nehemiah]
They're going to be so mad

31:12.203 --> 31:13.638
that they had to go after us.

31:13.739 --> 31:16.375
Because we're eating
everything y'all have for us.

31:16.474 --> 31:19.411
TJ Lavin, I'm eating every drop.
I'm licking it.

31:19.510 --> 31:21.948
I'm picking it out my teeth
and I'm swallowing that, too.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.349
Nothing is getting left
on the table,

31:24.450 --> 31:27.885
on the mirror, on the ground.
We're eating.

31:27.987 --> 31:30.288
-Bon appÃ©tit.
-Bon appÃ©tit.

31:30.388 --> 31:32.458
-Ready. Go.
-[horn blares]

31:32.557 --> 31:34.961
* *

31:37.628 --> 31:39.065
[Nehemiah]
I'm going to take the lead.

31:39.164 --> 31:41.133
I know that Ayanna
has been far removed

31:41.232 --> 31:42.634
from The Challenge
for many years.

31:42.733 --> 31:45.671
So I'm okay with just trying
to guide her through it.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.773
I feel the beam get really,
really wobbly.

31:48.874 --> 31:51.943
But the only thing
I have in my mind is win.

31:52.044 --> 31:53.545
So I start to walk across.

31:54.279 --> 31:56.147
-Ah!
-[all exclaim]

31:56.248 --> 31:58.784
-The nut buster.
-I told you, I told you.

31:58.884 --> 32:00.586
You hear it crack.

32:00.685 --> 32:02.453
[all exclaim]

32:02.554 --> 32:06.125
Damn. I think Nehemiah swallowed
his nuts on that butt-plant.

32:06.224 --> 32:08.294
-Ouchy.
-Oh, that-- he's... he fell.

32:08.394 --> 32:09.894
I hope he's not trying to have
children in the near future.

32:09.996 --> 32:11.529
[Cohutta] Everybody goes,

32:11.630 --> 32:14.165
maybe walking across this thing
is not the best option.

32:14.266 --> 32:17.103
* *

32:17.202 --> 32:20.205
[all cheering indistinctly]

32:22.074 --> 32:24.875
[Ayanna] My abdomen is saying,

32:24.977 --> 32:27.945
girl, what is wrong with you?

32:28.047 --> 32:29.448
Come on, Ayanna.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.986
All of a sudden,
my left booty cheek,

32:34.086 --> 32:36.422
my right booty cheek,
we're swaying,

32:36.521 --> 32:37.923
and I'm trying
to hold onto that beam

32:38.023 --> 32:39.424
like it's my baby girl.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.593
-[screaming]
-Oh, no!

32:41.692 --> 32:44.496
* *

32:49.601 --> 32:51.869
-[Tina] Let's go.
-[man 10] Go, Ayanna.

32:53.271 --> 32:55.106
[Nehemiah] Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.009
[all exclaim]

33:00.278 --> 33:02.213
Crash.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.982
I see my dreams float away.

33:05.584 --> 33:08.753
This is a perfect example
of where it goes wrong

33:08.854 --> 33:10.521
in a challenge
when you have a partner.

33:10.622 --> 33:13.159
You could be a very strong
player, perform awesome,

33:13.259 --> 33:16.994
but because of an error
with your partner,

33:17.096 --> 33:18.963
-you're both going down.
-[bell chimes]

33:20.199 --> 33:23.169
[cheering and applauding]

33:23.269 --> 33:25.903
So now, we just got to
both make it across the beam.

33:27.806 --> 33:30.741
Nehemiah and Ayanna
have set the bar today

33:30.842 --> 33:32.344
and it's pretty damn low.

33:32.443 --> 33:34.846
Pretty much if both people
make it across the beam,

33:34.945 --> 33:36.682
they're not going to be last.

33:42.988 --> 33:44.455
[bell chimes]

33:44.556 --> 33:46.692
Let's go, let's go!

33:47.492 --> 33:50.128
-[bell chimes]
-[all] Yeah.

33:50.229 --> 33:52.064
[Darrell] I know, America,
we look like chumps.

33:52.163 --> 33:53.964
Y'all want to see us
run across this beam,

33:54.066 --> 33:55.500
but I'm going to tell you
right now,

33:55.601 --> 33:56.934
Nehemiah's nuts
is in his throat,

33:57.035 --> 33:58.503
Ayanna fell in,
so we're going to play it safe,

33:58.604 --> 33:59.805
because ain't nobody
trying to go

33:59.904 --> 34:02.039
-in that elimination.
-[bell chimes]

34:02.773 --> 34:03.741
[bell chimes]

34:03.842 --> 34:07.045
-[all] Yeah.
-Yeah, Casey.

34:07.145 --> 34:08.780
Casey and Teck!

34:08.880 --> 34:12.418
I look up, the basketball
net seems a little far.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.420
I am all of five foot one
and a half.

34:14.519 --> 34:15.820
* I wish I was
a little bit taller *

34:15.920 --> 34:16.954
* I wish I was a baller *

34:17.054 --> 34:18.690
* I wish I had a girl *

34:18.789 --> 34:19.958
* Who looked good
I would call her *

34:20.057 --> 34:21.327
Yeah.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.429
Come here. Come here.
Wait, wait. You ready?

34:23.795 --> 34:25.231
One, two, three. Go.

34:25.331 --> 34:27.032
* I wish I was
a little bit taller *

34:27.132 --> 34:29.835
[all exclaim]

34:29.934 --> 34:32.170
Finger-roll it, girl.
Finger roll.

34:32.271 --> 34:33.704
Jump shot, something.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.706
I know you dated a basketball
player before. Shit.

34:35.806 --> 34:37.976
I just want my dunk shown
in slow motion, please.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.278
Can you slo-mo my dunk,
please? Just...

34:42.079 --> 34:43.148
Boom!

34:43.815 --> 34:45.617
[Casey] Mine didn't go in.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.385
[Teck] We did that. Don't worry.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.688
Every day, all day
I'm walking beams for a living.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.257
I'm a contractor.

34:52.358 --> 34:53.891
All my buddies at home
are going to be, like,

34:53.992 --> 34:55.760
what was your ass doing crawling

34:55.860 --> 34:59.864
across that enormous beam
this high over the water?

35:00.599 --> 35:01.967
[bell chimes]

35:03.202 --> 35:05.737
-[bell chimes]
-[indistinct chatter]

35:08.039 --> 35:10.509
I'm hoping
that just one person fails.

35:10.608 --> 35:11.976
One person just to fall.

35:12.077 --> 35:15.181
That's all that I need,
because at this point

35:15.280 --> 35:17.648
it's not looking so good
for me and Ayanna.

35:17.748 --> 35:20.552
-[bell chimes]
-[applauding]

35:20.652 --> 35:22.320
[bell chimes]

35:22.420 --> 35:24.222
* I know I've never, ever felt
Like this before *

35:25.157 --> 35:26.358
[Brad] Make sure that skull
doesn't fall out, Katie.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.226
Push it back down.

35:28.327 --> 35:29.728
* Stuck between hell
And high water *

35:29.827 --> 35:31.630
-Just like this.
-[bell chimes]

35:31.730 --> 35:34.666
* Hey, dance, yeah *

35:34.766 --> 35:36.001
* Nothing left for me to do *

35:36.101 --> 35:37.835
-[groaning]
-* But dance *

35:37.936 --> 35:39.003
* Off these bad times
I'm going through *

35:39.103 --> 35:40.639
-Yeah!
-* Just dance *

35:40.739 --> 35:41.773
-[all exclaim]
-* Hey *

35:41.873 --> 35:43.842
* Got canned heat in my heels *

35:43.942 --> 35:45.476
* Tonight, baby *

35:45.577 --> 35:47.778
* You know I got canned heat
In my heels *

35:47.878 --> 35:49.914
[Nehemiah] Goddamn.

35:50.748 --> 35:52.251
* Hey *

35:52.351 --> 35:55.586
Next up, Steve and Tina.
You're last but not least.

35:55.686 --> 35:57.922
[Tina]
It has been a very long time,

35:58.023 --> 36:00.157
but I'm feeling pretty good
about this one.

36:00.259 --> 36:03.762
We're going to kick the shit
out of all those old people.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.431
-You're going to see it.
-I'm the oldest...

36:05.530 --> 36:07.233
-You're the oldest one?
-I'm the second oldest person.

36:07.333 --> 36:08.766
-Well, you don't need
to tell them that.
-Okay.

36:10.902 --> 36:14.039
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

36:14.139 --> 36:17.809
I have some elements
I have to deal with,

36:17.909 --> 36:20.878
which is uno and dos.

36:20.978 --> 36:22.447
Didn't have those
back in the day.

36:22.547 --> 36:24.815
They are big, huge hazards.

36:24.916 --> 36:27.085
So I tape these suckers up.

36:27.184 --> 36:30.222
Titties down.
Let's fucking play.

36:31.789 --> 36:32.990
[Jasmine]
They're flying through.

36:33.090 --> 36:34.226
[Derek]
They're flying through this.

36:34.326 --> 36:35.994
[bell chimes]

36:38.664 --> 36:40.731
[bell chimes]

36:40.831 --> 36:43.268
[Tina] Holy shit. We did good.

36:43.369 --> 36:45.670
-That's a competitive run.
-Yeah, that was good.

36:45.771 --> 36:47.072
Yeah, that was
a competitive run.

36:47.172 --> 36:48.739
[Jodi] I'm known
to be a good competitor

36:48.840 --> 36:50.007
in the Challenge world.

36:50.108 --> 36:51.409
Being a good competitor,
unfortunately,

36:51.510 --> 36:53.110
can put you in the line of fire.

36:53.210 --> 36:54.346
People can want
to get rid of you.

36:54.445 --> 36:55.847
I am concerned if Tina wins

36:55.947 --> 36:57.983
what her choices would be.

36:58.083 --> 37:01.018
Nice work, Tina.
Steve, nice job, man...

37:01.119 --> 37:04.222
I was like, "Steve,
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa..."

37:07.358 --> 37:09.894
Well, that sucked.

37:11.530 --> 37:14.164
How bad could you possibly play?

37:15.000 --> 37:16.601
You boot scoot boogied
that shit

37:16.702 --> 37:18.503
all the way across that thing.
Come on.

37:18.603 --> 37:22.673
I mean, not one of you went
across that balance beam

37:22.773 --> 37:24.041
like a balance beam.

37:24.141 --> 37:26.110
Everybody looked
like a bunch of scared cats.

37:26.844 --> 37:29.114
You looked pitiful.
Just embarrassing.

37:29.213 --> 37:31.550
I want to see you do it
before you start talking smack.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.652
[imitates]
"I want to see you do it
before you start talking..."

37:33.751 --> 37:36.355
Listen, that was playing
not to lose.

37:36.454 --> 37:40.391
I need you to play to win.
There's 500 grand on the mark.

37:40.492 --> 37:41.626
You got to get that.

37:41.726 --> 37:43.728
So I think
it's time for a twist.

37:45.664 --> 37:46.831
From here on out,

37:46.931 --> 37:50.302
every elimination
is a double elimination.

37:51.637 --> 37:53.771
[MJ] TJ has just dropped
a bomb on us.

37:53.871 --> 37:55.106
We control nothing.

37:55.206 --> 37:57.576
Even when we feel
like we are, we're not.

37:57.675 --> 37:59.177
TJ is in control.

38:00.010 --> 38:02.914
I honestly don't blame TJ
for giving us a hard time

38:03.014 --> 38:04.983
about going across this beam
on our butts.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.918
I am embarrassed by it.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.320
Why you always got
to fuck with me, TJ?

38:09.420 --> 38:11.021
What do you want?
What do you want me to say?

38:11.121 --> 38:13.057
You, like, could have
did a lot better.

38:13.592 --> 38:17.061
Fuck you, TJ. Excuse my French.
But, no, really. Fuck you.

38:17.161 --> 38:21.367
Now, the one losing team
was Ayanna and Nehemiah.

38:22.199 --> 38:24.969
And they will be sent directly
into the Arena,

38:25.070 --> 38:26.137
which is where
all the elimination rounds

38:26.237 --> 38:27.539
are going to be taking place.

38:27.639 --> 38:30.708
Now the two teams
that did the least terrible

38:30.809 --> 38:33.110
were separated by one second.

38:33.210 --> 38:37.215
* *

38:41.619 --> 38:42.987
Steve and Loudmouth.

38:43.088 --> 38:45.891
-Yeah.
-[applauding]

38:47.092 --> 38:49.094
And Derrick and Jodi.

38:52.563 --> 38:55.701
Winning is always
a double-edged sword,

38:55.800 --> 38:57.835
because winning gives you
safety in this game

38:57.936 --> 39:02.072
but it makes you a threat.
So you get onto people's radar.

39:02.172 --> 39:04.876
You can't really go into
these things with a strategy

39:04.976 --> 39:06.478
because the game is always
changing on you.

39:06.577 --> 39:09.947
But the one team
to get it done the fastest,

39:10.047 --> 39:12.282
and our winners
for the first challenge...

39:16.755 --> 39:17.755
Derrick and Jodi.

39:17.856 --> 39:21.092
-Yes. Yeah.
-[screaming]

39:22.893 --> 39:24.195
[Jodi] I'm really excited.

39:24.295 --> 39:26.532
It feels amazing
to win the first competition.

39:26.632 --> 39:28.298
It feels good to be safe.

39:28.733 --> 39:30.735
Booyah!

39:31.570 --> 39:34.072
Road Rules: X-Treme, baby.
We're back.

39:34.806 --> 39:38.242
Now I need Derrick and Jodi
to go back to the house.

39:38.342 --> 39:41.211
Deliberate and nominate
four players

39:41.311 --> 39:45.282
for possible selection
to go into the Arena.

39:45.916 --> 39:48.454
[Tyler] Winning is great because
you get to pound your chest,

39:48.554 --> 39:51.590
peacock around and be like,
yeah, I won the first challenge.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.023
However, that means that

39:53.123 --> 39:54.693
you are putting a huge target
on your back.

39:54.793 --> 39:58.228
[TJ] Now out of those four
players, two men and two women,

39:58.329 --> 40:01.331
everyone else needs
to vote and select

40:01.432 --> 40:04.503
one man and one woman
to go into the Arena

40:04.603 --> 40:07.105
to go against
our losing players.

40:07.773 --> 40:09.306
[Brad] I like Derrick and Jodi.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.208
But at this point,
I don't envy their position

40:11.309 --> 40:12.409
and I don't think
they really know

40:12.510 --> 40:13.744
what they're going to do.

40:13.844 --> 40:16.181
No one pictured having
to nominate four people.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.750
I will see you at the Arena.
Good luck.

40:19.585 --> 40:21.786
["Shook Ones, Part II"
by Mobb Deep playing]

40:21.887 --> 40:23.621
* I got you stuck
off the realness *

40:23.722 --> 40:26.023
* We be the infamous
You heard of us *

40:26.123 --> 40:27.592
* Official Queensbridge *

40:30.795 --> 40:33.164
[Derrick] I've been busting
Nehemiah's balls

40:33.264 --> 40:34.565
since last season.

40:34.666 --> 40:37.068
Why would it be any different
this season?

40:37.168 --> 40:39.003
If you win, you get power.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.505
And I just think that

40:40.606 --> 40:43.340
we're gonna have to help
Nehemiah grow some bigger balls.

40:43.440 --> 40:46.344
* 'Cause ain't no such things
As halfway crooks *

40:46.443 --> 40:48.514
This game tends
to make people very paranoid.

40:48.614 --> 40:51.215
You know, at the beginning,
you try to play a game,

40:51.315 --> 40:53.284
you try not to step
on too many toes.

40:53.384 --> 40:55.085
But the way that
this game is set up,

40:55.186 --> 40:56.487
you have to create some enemies.

40:56.588 --> 40:58.356
You have to put people
up on the board.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.858
This is where the game
gets real.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.726
-Clocking in for overtime.
-Yup.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.528
-It's all it is.
-Yup.

41:04.730 --> 41:08.233
Do a little extra work.
I'm no stranger to it.

41:08.900 --> 41:10.501
It's going to be
my ninth elimination.

41:11.335 --> 41:13.739
[Nehemiah] Over the years,
I've played it honest

41:13.838 --> 41:15.574
and it hasn't worked for me.

41:15.673 --> 41:19.376
This time I'm trying to play
this game a lot more smart.

41:19.476 --> 41:22.313
I've always played this game
with my heart on my sleeve.

41:22.413 --> 41:23.681
[Teck] That's who you are.

41:23.782 --> 41:25.349
Trying to play all noble
and trying to play,

41:25.449 --> 41:27.652
but this game
rewards the opposite.

41:28.753 --> 41:31.556
$500,000. I got your back.

41:31.657 --> 41:34.025
Nehemiah,
this time he's out for blood,

41:34.125 --> 41:35.425
which I can't blame the brother.

41:35.527 --> 41:37.061
Everybody has to play
their own game.

41:37.161 --> 41:40.599
It's about to get ugly,
y'all, and let's go.

41:49.407 --> 41:51.342
* Oh, I had a future
But I let it go *

41:51.442 --> 41:53.711
[Ayanna] Sometimes in life,
you wish you'd get a do-over,

41:53.811 --> 41:55.681
and this feels like that.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.682
[men screaming]

41:57.782 --> 41:58.983
[truck horn blaring]

41:59.083 --> 42:00.885
[Teck] Yeah!

42:01.485 --> 42:03.153
[Tina]
You should have saved him!

42:03.253 --> 42:05.356
[Teck] If you did somebody dirty
back in the day,

42:05.456 --> 42:07.092
it's going to come back
to bite you in the ass.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.561
* They said it was
A smash, though *

42:09.661 --> 42:11.228
-[groans]
-Breathe.
-Hang in there.

42:11.329 --> 42:13.030
[Darrell]
500 grand is on the line.

42:13.130 --> 42:14.800
Fuck all these friendships.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.835
I'm trying to win.

42:18.268 --> 42:20.137
[MJ]
This may be the hardest thing

42:20.237 --> 42:22.007
that you've ever done
in your life.

42:22.106 --> 42:24.842
-I'm the wrong fucking one!
-You are the wrong one.

42:24.943 --> 42:26.476
[Teck]
Why would you upset someone

42:26.577 --> 42:28.646
that has the fate of your
Challenge in their hands?

42:28.746 --> 42:30.315
[clattering]

42:30.414 --> 42:32.117
Nice Tina is dead.

42:33.483 --> 42:35.721
[Sophia] I just wanted to prove
myself in these challenges,

42:35.820 --> 42:37.588
make myself feel good.

42:37.688 --> 42:40.157
[Teck] This game is about
to get very ugly.

42:40.257 --> 42:41.927
* *

42:42.027 --> 42:43.193
[groans]

42:43.293 --> 42:45.329
I can't do this anymore.
It's not worth it.

42:45.429 --> 42:51.469
[woman screams]

42:51.568 --> 42:53.804
