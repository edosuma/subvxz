00:05.506 --> 00:06.572
What are you doing?

00:06.574 --> 00:07.740
I'm done, Cut. I quit.

00:07.742 --> 00:09.174
SAM: <i> Previously on</i> Aquarius...

00:09.176 --> 00:11.443
There's an open seat
on the city council.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.644
I can't afford
a campaign.

00:12.646 --> 00:15.014
It's not an election,
it's an appointment.

00:15.016 --> 00:16.448
KEN: <i> Let's talk about</i>
<i> your campaign finances,</i>

00:16.450 --> 00:20.953
about the mysterious and large
sum of money that appeared
with no source.

00:20.955 --> 00:22.888
Leave me alone.
We'll call it even.

00:22.890 --> 00:23.322
But we're not.

00:23.324 --> 00:26.892
<i> You want to explain</i>
<i> the concept of paying me off?</i>

00:26.894 --> 00:29.261
SAM: <i> You're right</i>
<i> about me, Billi.</i>

00:29.263 --> 00:29.995
I am an addict.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.398
At least the thing
you can't quit helps people.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.799
I thought you'd be mad.

00:33.801 --> 00:34.900
BILLI: You're a mess.

00:34.902 --> 00:35.467
I like you anyway.

00:35.469 --> 00:39.638
We will all be free
when Helter Skelter starts.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.539
What the hell is
Helter Skelter?

This, the Beatles,

SAM: <i> What you're doing </i>

00:53.454 --> 00:55.754
I just want to understand
why you're going to
all this trouble.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.557
GERALD: Why don't you use that
celebrated brain of yours

00:58.559 --> 01:02.628

01:14.909 --> 01:16.608
Quarter 'til, Sam.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.043
All right, how much
for another hour?

01:18.045 --> 01:20.779
Another week of this, I was
gonna start looking at boats.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.181
You've been
a gracious host.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.149

and serve.

01:24.151 --> 01:24.750

01:24.752 --> 01:27.486
-Thirteen minutes.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.523
-This is the last of them.
-Hey.

01:31.525 --> 01:32.224
I hope you're speedy.

01:32.226 --> 01:36.061
There was only one fire engine
working when he called me,

01:36.063 --> 01:36.995
and it was pretty close.

01:36.997 --> 01:41.300
So, any house within earshot
of this line could be our guy.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.135
He mentioned my uniform.

01:43.137 --> 01:46.738
So, it's gotta be somebody
I cuffed when I was a uni.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.978
Look at this.

01:55.683 --> 01:57.116
I know him.

02:18.439 --> 02:21.006
-What are you having?
-Coffee, please.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.450
Do I know you?

02:32.720 --> 02:34.586
I don't know, do you?

02:35.456 --> 02:37.189
Sam Hodiak.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.795
Gerald Dunn.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.601
How long you been
a photographer, Gerald?

02:50.404 --> 02:53.739
Now, how do you know
I take pictures, Sam?

02:53.741 --> 02:55.240
I can smell it on you.

02:57.912 --> 02:59.011
The stop bath acid.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.346
How long you been a cop, Sam?

03:01.348 --> 03:03.348
Now, how did you know
I was a cop?

03:03.350 --> 03:06.852
Well, same way I know
you're not anymore.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.488
I read the papers.

03:11.859 --> 03:15.460
It's a shame
how they forced you out.

03:16.163 --> 03:17.729
The scandal.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.865
Not fair.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.367
And I know how much
you loved it.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.735
I don't know.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.370
Not lately.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.306
-No?
-No.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.341
Too many rules.

03:29.877 --> 03:33.212
I'm kind of looking forward
to doing whatever I want.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.181
To whoever I want.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.056
I'll see you around, Gerald.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.392
Yeah, maybe I'll see you, Sam.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.994
Dinner's on me.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.752
There's more
where that came from.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.321
-A lot more.
-You got it on you?

04:16.323 --> 04:17.556
The cash?

04:17.558 --> 04:19.358
One thing. I handle it.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.494
I'll make sure that
we don't go hungry again.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.032
CHARLIE: Is that it?

04:27.334 --> 04:28.967
The only condition?

04:39.647 --> 04:41.647
Patty, you gotta get.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.402

half the drunk tank.

05:05.105 --> 05:09.374
Kristin left a while back.
I haven't slept much.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.209
Oh, man.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.145
What's her excuse?

05:15.549 --> 05:15.947
Yes.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.082
You wanna tell me
why the night guys

05:17.084 --> 05:18.817
can't stop talking about
some hot, new lady cop?

05:18.819 --> 05:20.218
Catching up on paperwork,
Lieutenant.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.521
When you call me by my title,
I know it means ass.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.755
I know about
the truckload of files

05:23.757 --> 05:25.257
you pulled out of
records for Sammy,

05:25.259 --> 05:27.359
who's now our
dearly departed citizen.

05:27.361 --> 05:28.727
-We're close.
-To what?

05:28.729 --> 05:30.262
Lyons has
the Tina Greenwood file.

05:30.264 --> 05:31.630
Everything else
is just pictures.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.799
In this precinct,
cases need bodies, okay?

05:33.801 --> 05:36.635
And I need cops that don't
sleep on the job, so...

05:36.637 --> 05:38.236
As you say, Lieutenant.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.339
Ooh... Ooh...

05:40.341 --> 05:44.376
You really shrunk me down
from all that razor sarcasm.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.778
You know the best way
to work out of this funk?

05:46.780 --> 05:49.681
Big jolly handfuls of punani.
Trust me on this.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.117
Jeannie and I split up
four times in 21 years

05:52.119 --> 05:55.620
and every time was just
balls-deep bliss.
You know what I mean?

05:55.622 --> 05:58.657
Four times? Why don't
you just get a divorce?

05:59.393 --> 06:00.859
We're Catholic.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.729
-Daddy!
-Hi, honey.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.630
Wait, does Charlie know?
If he sees you here...

06:05.632 --> 06:08.266
It's fine.
He said I could stay.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.801
How you feeling?

06:10.738 --> 06:14.706
Happy, swollen.
Here, come sing with us.

06:15.275 --> 06:17.909
What's... What's this?

06:18.345 --> 06:19.745
Helter Skelter.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.616
-Helter...
-PATTY: We're safe here.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.918
Out there,
that's where it's bad.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.354
CHARLIE: My girls.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.256
Getting ready for it.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.492
Forewarned, forearmed.

06:34.828 --> 06:38.029
Wait. Charlie? The guns.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.331
Oh, kids and their toys.

06:39.333 --> 06:44.669
Put them on an old movie set,
they think they're
the next Annie Oakley.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.372
What's "Helter Skelter"?

06:50.177 --> 06:51.943
It's not for now.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.617
I'll be back.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.887
Okay, bye, Daddy. I love you.

07:04.825 --> 07:07.959
BILLI: So, are you asking me
what I think you should do?

07:07.961 --> 07:09.461
SAM: Well, I am a patient now.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.863
Oh. Wow, thank you.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.665
But I don't ball my patients.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.768
Well, not anymore.

07:19.506 --> 07:22.774
(SIGHS) I found him.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.776
You did?

07:24.912 --> 07:25.877
-How?
-When he called,

07:25.879 --> 07:27.345
there was a fire engine
in the background.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.681
It turns out there was
only one fire in LA last night

07:29.683 --> 07:31.583
and only one
resident in that vicinity

07:31.585 --> 07:34.186
that I busted in
1952 for burglary.

07:34.188 --> 07:35.821
So, then why don't
you be done?

07:35.823 --> 07:38.657
Now. Just hand over
the case to the cops.

07:38.926 --> 07:39.891
Can't.

07:39.893 --> 07:40.725
-You won't.
-Same thing.

07:40.727 --> 07:43.028
See, the fact that
you can't tell the difference
between the two

07:43.030 --> 07:45.430
leads me to believe that
you're gonna have a hard time

07:45.432 --> 07:46.064
in your next career.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.233
-In what sense?
-I mean, what else
are you good at?

07:48.235 --> 07:50.502
Besides sex and breakfast.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.440
Oh.

07:55.976 --> 07:56.908
Hello.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.878
A reprimand?
For sleeping at my desk?

07:59.880 --> 08:03.315
Well, you did sort of
hit that sweet spot, honey.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.850
You were withholding
and mouthy

08:04.852 --> 08:07.552
with a commanding
officer, so...

08:07.754 --> 08:08.854
Good.

08:08.856 --> 08:12.290
I'm glad you did this
because I'm filing on you.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.358
Well, that's adorable.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.627
For what, pray tell?
And with whom?

08:15.629 --> 08:18.330
Sexual discrimination.
With the Commissioner.

08:18.332 --> 08:21.199
And considering that Brian was
asleep right across from me

08:21.201 --> 08:23.902
and instead of a write-up,
you told him to get...

08:23.904 --> 08:25.370
What was it?

08:25.372 --> 08:27.839
"Jolly handfuls of punani."

08:29.142 --> 08:31.009
Jesus, take the wheel.

08:37.117 --> 08:41.953
You have got to be
an absolute hellcat
in the sack,

08:41.955 --> 08:44.389
in my professional opinion.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.193
-Hey.
-Jesus!

08:48.195 --> 08:51.396
If I need...
If I need to do a bad thing...

08:51.398 --> 08:52.631
Then don't ask a cop.

08:52.633 --> 08:53.865
I'm asking a friend.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.467
Now, see, that's low.

08:55.469 --> 08:56.902
I know.

09:09.883 --> 09:14.085
Mr. Dunn? You mind
coming with me, please?

09:25.132 --> 09:28.366
So, are you going to tell me
what this is about, Detective?

09:28.368 --> 09:31.069
(SIGHS) At the station.

09:31.405 --> 09:32.904

10:48.682 --> 10:53.885
Hodiak busted you in '52.
Stealing camera equipment.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.855
You filed a complaint.

10:56.857 --> 11:00.859
You said he beat
the confession out of you.

11:01.528 --> 11:02.293
<i> You got five years.</i>

11:02.295 --> 11:06.364
<i> Then another nine</i>
<i> for three escape attempts.</i>

11:06.733 --> 11:08.066
<i> Now that's... (SIGHS)</i>

11:08.068 --> 11:09.367
<i> That's 14 years.</i>

11:09.369 --> 11:12.737
<i> But why'd you keep trying</i>
<i> to escape, Gerald?</i>

11:13.774 --> 11:16.174
<i> You're married, right?</i>

11:17.144 --> 11:18.977
Did she wait for you?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.746
Your wife.

11:26.086 --> 11:26.685
GRACE: <i> Artie Donaldson.</i>

11:26.687 --> 11:30.555
No campaign,
no clue what he's doing.
He just shows up and it's,

11:30.557 --> 11:33.491
"Hey, Artie, here's a seat
on the city council."

11:33.493 --> 11:39.064
Honey, if this
is giving you fits,
maybe politics isn't for you.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.833
GRACE: At least I can rest.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.702
(SIGHS)

11:45.338 --> 11:46.871
I'm so tired.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.473
Tell.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.413
My daughter, Emma,

11:58.585 --> 12:00.518
she's not in France.

12:00.520 --> 12:04.022
Let me guess. She's a hippie.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.094
GRACE: <i> Something like that.</i>

12:09.096 --> 12:10.395
BETTY: You know,
plenty of politicians

12:10.397 --> 12:12.931
have survived worse
than a wayward daughter.

12:12.933 --> 12:16.468
I mean, we all have secrets.
We all lie.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.270
EMMA: <i> It's a creepy crawly.</i>

12:19.272 --> 12:20.939
I've done a hundred of these.

12:20.941 --> 12:21.639
Worst thing that can happen,

12:21.641 --> 12:25.110
it makes some old rich guy
question all his comforts
in life.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.745
Like we did to you.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.646
KEN: What is Helter Skelter?

12:28.648 --> 12:29.848
EMMA: You'll have
to ask Charlie.

12:29.850 --> 12:33.151
We can leave, you and me.
Right now.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.319
No, we can't leave the family.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.820
It's different than before.
Something...

12:35.822 --> 12:40.492
You're different.
And that feels scary.

12:40.927 --> 12:41.860
But Charlie taught us,

12:41.862 --> 12:46.030
"If you stop fighting,
the fear is gone."

12:46.900 --> 12:48.967
You have to believe that.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.776
CHARLIE: <i> There's only</i>
<i> one thing left to do.</i>

13:02.249 --> 13:03.715
Now you

13:04.417 --> 13:05.817
and Sadie

13:05.819 --> 13:09.387
know what I'm asking you for,
don't you, Tex?

13:09.856 --> 13:11.389
Yeah.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.091
Tie 'em up.

13:13.460 --> 13:17.996
Use knives.
Paint the walls with blood.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.532
Yes.

13:21.401 --> 13:25.637
Charlie. This stops now.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.772
It begins now.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.274
See, this is birth.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.910
Do you hear this?
What he's making you do?

13:31.912 --> 13:36.214
Tex is his own man, Ken.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.122
We're ready.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.091
KEN: Not Emma, please.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.761
Emma! (GRUNTS)

13:51.565 --> 13:52.797
(GRUNTS)

13:54.968 --> 13:56.968
Leave something witchy.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.336
(COUGHS)

I gotta kick him loose.

I know.

14:20.894 --> 14:25.296
For whatever it's worth,
I'm sure he's your guy.

14:25.298 --> 14:29.200
It's like he knows we know.
And he loves it.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.668
He say anything
about his wife?

14:30.670 --> 14:33.471
He didn't say
anything about anything. Why?

What?

14:42.148 --> 14:43.481
Muriel Dunn.

That name seem
familiar to you?

15:49.149 --> 15:50.048
What'd the PO say?

15:50.050 --> 15:54.686
Well, he served time on a
Peeping Tom charge last year,

15:54.688 --> 15:56.421
which explains why
he went dark for six months.

15:56.423 --> 15:59.590
But there were
no escape attempts to try
to go see Muriel.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.559
-What's that about?
-Wait.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.560
Muriel Dunn is his wife?

16:02.562 --> 16:05.663
The '50s pin-up girl?
My dad was obsessed with her.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.131
That her?

16:07.600 --> 16:11.803
I mean, yeah.
I've never actually
seen her with clothes on,

16:11.805 --> 16:13.972
but that is my
dad's sick crush.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.774
-He didn't talk for
days when she died.
-Died?

16:16.776 --> 16:18.443
CHARMAIN: She was murdered.

16:18.445 --> 16:21.579
Actually, I think
she was bound and strangled.
