00:02.965 --> 00:07.067
Okay, everybody,

00:07.069 --> 00:09.536
Any of you underage kids
need a drink to loosen up?

00:09.538 --> 00:11.271
I'll go first!

00:11.273 --> 00:14.874
Damn, Milk, a surprise
party for Mark-Ass Uncle Joey?

00:14.876 --> 00:17.110
This just confirms
how white you really is.

00:17.112 --> 00:19.541
And da buffet whack too.
Sad to say,

00:19.576 --> 00:21.982
but ya moms a Double
D-Lister in the kitchen.

00:21.984 --> 00:24.484
But good thing y'all stay

00:24.486 --> 00:26.586
Man, how come y'all always
raggin' on me?

00:26.588 --> 00:28.521
'Cause you always forcing us
to go to shit

00:28.523 --> 00:30.657
- we don't wanna go to.
- And you're white.

00:30.659 --> 00:34.294
- No I isn't.
- A'ight, Milk, if you part black, then prove it.

00:34.296 --> 00:36.162
Take this Cock Sauce to the dome.

00:36.164 --> 00:38.198
Ain't no thang
but some Burger Kang.

00:38.200 --> 00:42.702
I should probably film this, you
know, for your "30 for 30."

00:45.407 --> 00:48.107
Everybody, he's here!
He's here!

00:49.711 --> 00:51.745
<i> Surprise!</i>

00:54.983 --> 00:56.483
Milton!

00:59.354 --> 01:02.515
I've got Cock Sauce in my eyes!
It burns!

01:02.550 --> 01:05.391
I am gonna kill you, Milton!

01:05.394 --> 01:07.093
Got you mother[bleep].

01:14.168 --> 01:16.770
Calm down, Dave, it's your birthday.

01:16.772 --> 01:18.171
Exactly!
You should be the one

01:18.173 --> 01:21.641
- covered in Cock Sauce, not me.
- It was an accident.

01:21.643 --> 01:24.844
Accident my ass. The problem
is he doesn't respect me.

01:24.846 --> 01:28.548
He still calls me Uncle Joey.
My name is Dave!

01:28.550 --> 01:30.650
<i>Shut the [bleep] up, Uncle Joey!</i>

01:30.652 --> 01:33.620
You see what I'm talking about?
I can't take this anymore.

01:33.622 --> 01:35.221
You know what?
You're right.

01:35.223 --> 01:38.324
I've tried, but you two
just can't get along.

01:38.326 --> 01:41.861
- Maybe we should just end this.
- Divorce?!

01:41.863 --> 01:43.663
<i>Hell jeah!
Finally!</i>

01:43.665 --> 01:45.265
I can fix this, Hunny Buns.

01:45.267 --> 01:47.734
I got my camping trip
with my buddies coming up.

01:47.736 --> 01:51.171
I'll take Milton with me and
we'll do some father-son bonding.

01:51.173 --> 01:52.672
Fine, Dave.
Sounds great.

01:52.674 --> 01:55.175
And if it doesn't work out...
deuces.

01:57.245 --> 01:59.379
We still going to Hoechella
this weekend?

01:59.381 --> 02:01.648
Yup, I already got
the Jamallies on deck.

02:01.650 --> 02:05.118
- I finally got the recipe right.
- I can't go, my nigs.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.631
My moms making me go camping

02:06.632 --> 02:09.869
- with Uncle Joey old bitch-ass, mark-ass.
- Camping?

02:09.904 --> 02:11.925
Just tell that nig
you going with us instead.

02:11.927 --> 02:13.893
Can't. My mom said
we gonna divorce him

02:13.895 --> 02:15.428
if we don't work out our issues.

02:15.430 --> 02:16.896
So you already know
what I'm about to do.

02:16.898 --> 02:18.631
[bleep]...shit ...up.

02:18.633 --> 02:21.101
- How about that?
- Have fun with that.

02:21.103 --> 02:23.269
Ain't no way we gonna pass up
these flower crowns

02:23.271 --> 02:25.371
- with daddy issues.
- Nice try, buster.

02:25.373 --> 02:28.562
Without me paying, how y'all
getting into Hoechella?

02:29.411 --> 02:33.012
Damn, my nigs. Nature is
boringer than a mother[bleep].

02:33.014 --> 02:36.416
This why our people only camp out
for some old, new Jordans.

02:36.418 --> 02:38.218
Well, boys,
this'll be a good weekend.

02:38.220 --> 02:41.321
Roasting marshmallows,
telling stories over the campfire,

02:41.323 --> 02:44.424
- a little cosplay.
- Shut yo ass up, Uncle Joey.

02:44.426 --> 02:46.659
I ain't with all that
Bill-cosplay, homey.

02:46.661 --> 02:48.328
I'm keeping my cheeks intact.

02:48.330 --> 02:52.832
What the hell is cosplay?
Da fu... !?

02:52.834 --> 02:57.704
Now this is cosplay.
Suit up, my homeboys.

02:59.374 --> 03:01.508
<i>Doctor, his blood pressure's
dropping faster</i>

03:01.510 --> 03:03.309
<i>- than our ratings.
- Well, mine's rising</i>

03:03.311 --> 03:05.945
<i>and I'ma kill your bitch ass

03:05.947 --> 03:08.751
<i>That's just my creative

Aye, this "Empire" shit relatable, ca.

03:16.024 --> 03:18.424
<i>We interrupt your regularly
scheduled programming</i>

03:18.426 --> 03:20.994
<i>to bring you this nonsense

03:20.996 --> 03:24.197
<i>I'm here today to address
the latest Chamberlain Heights</i>

03:24.199 --> 03:27.267
<i>Police shooting of an allegedly
unarmed black man.</i>

03:27.269 --> 03:30.036
<i>Get your hands up!</i>

03:30.138 --> 03:32.605
<i>He's resisting!</i>

03:32.607 --> 03:34.941

from the arresting officers,</i>

03:34.943 --> 03:37.177

<i>The officers will be placed on
fully-paid, administrative leave.</i>

03:43.218 --> 03:45.952
Damn, sounds more like
a paid vacation to me.

03:45.954 --> 03:48.188
That's what's up.
Imagine if on every job

03:48.190 --> 03:50.490
you shot a mother[bleep],
they paid you to stay home.

03:50.492 --> 03:52.692
Shit, I'd go back
to teaching pre-school.

03:52.694 --> 03:54.928
Aye, yo,
you might be onto something.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.963
Shit, maybe I'll become a cop.

03:56.965 --> 04:00.867
- A pig? You?
- Yup. All I gots to do is shoot a nigga

04:00.869 --> 04:03.203
and then book me
a nice-ass paycation.

04:03.205 --> 04:07.207
Aye, caa, you lie down with pigs,
you wake up bacon.

04:07.209 --> 04:10.076
Shit, I wake up bakin' every day.

04:10.312 --> 04:12.045
This some [bleep] up shit.

04:12.047 --> 04:14.314
How y'all gonna have a costume
party with no breezys?

04:14.316 --> 04:16.182
We could call a few dimes
and have our own

04:16.184 --> 04:18.851
- Hoechella right here.
- I can call Medina.

04:18.853 --> 04:21.120
I said dime, not Olympic medals.

04:22.591 --> 04:24.123
Holy shit, Dave.

04:24.125 --> 04:26.626
I see you brought some color
to the proceedings.

04:28.029 --> 04:30.496
Come on, guys,
they're Milton's friends.

04:30.498 --> 04:34.334
I'm just trying to keep Hunny
satisfied. Happy wife, happy life.

04:34.336 --> 04:37.036
Well, they're certainly
gonna add some authenticity.

04:37.038 --> 04:40.206
And we're not even paying them?
Very period appropriate.

04:40.208 --> 04:42.976
Hate off to the master.
See what I did there?

04:45.080 --> 04:46.946
Good news, you passed the exam.

04:46.948 --> 04:48.915
Bad news, you failed the drug test.

04:48.917 --> 04:52.051
Oh, word. I guess it's
back to funemployment then.

04:52.053 --> 04:54.713
Hold on now. Luckily
for you, we're desperate

04:54.714 --> 04:57.590
to increase diversity and add
a little color to the force

04:57.592 --> 05:00.793
- to make the community feel safer.
- That's real talk, though.

05:00.795 --> 05:02.695
So tell me, son,
why do you wanna be

05:02.697 --> 05:04.664
one of Chamberlain Heights' finest?

05:04.666 --> 05:07.166
- I wanna shoot a nigga.
- Bingo! You're hired!

05:07.168 --> 05:09.802
Here's your gun, here's your
badge, here's your mustache.

05:09.804 --> 05:11.938
Now go make America great again.

05:15.043 --> 05:18.044
I'ma get you, boy.

05:18.046 --> 05:20.914
Yo, this shit suck like
some socially conscious rap.

05:20.916 --> 05:23.850
Yeah, if you want my money,
you best mumble some shit.

05:23.852 --> 05:27.854
I ain't mad at the buffet, though.
This swine is fine and divine.

05:27.856 --> 05:30.556
- Like Amber Rose behind.
<i>- Bars.</i>

05:30.558 --> 05:33.793
Yo, check it. I never
heard of this game "Runaway,"

05:33.795 --> 05:35.662
but I'm making a grip
of reparations.

05:35.664 --> 05:38.398
God damn it, Grover, you won again.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.333
You'd have fetched
top-dollar back in the day.

05:40.335 --> 05:41.634
Okay, mount up.

05:41.636 --> 05:44.404
The reenactment of the Battle
of Funkstown is commencing.

05:47.976 --> 05:49.709
- Whoa.
- What the [bleep]?

05:49.711 --> 05:52.078
Why you hoisting that
racist rag, Uncle Joey?

05:52.080 --> 05:53.713
I thought they outlawed that shit.

05:53.715 --> 05:55.748
Don't be ridiculous.
It's not racist.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.884
During the Civil War,
it represented the South's fight

05:57.886 --> 05:59.452
for freedom from Northern oppression.

05:59.454 --> 06:02.155
This flag's about pride,
not prejudice.

06:02.157 --> 06:03.923
You mean like pride
in owning slaves?

06:03.925 --> 06:06.326
Say word? That's why
they fought the Civil War?

06:06.328 --> 06:07.961
Well, what did you guys
think it was about?

06:07.963 --> 06:11.064
What all fights are about: somebody
was talking shit on Twitter.

06:11.066 --> 06:13.800
Look, it doesn't matter because
this is the flag they flew

06:13.802 --> 06:16.336
and everything
needs to be 100% authentic.

06:16.338 --> 06:18.638
Come on, let's take
the General Lee Trevino.

06:20.842 --> 06:23.535
I don't know about y'all,
but I ain't finna just stand here

06:23.536 --> 06:26.179
and let Uncle Joey
celebrate his "prejudicismses."

06:26.181 --> 06:28.648
We need to teach these
racists bastards a lesson.

06:28.650 --> 06:30.984
- What y'all trying to do?
- Let's [bleep] some shit up

06:30.986 --> 06:33.453
so I can get Uncle Joey's
bitch ass outta my life

06:33.455 --> 06:35.488
and get a real dad, like Birdman.

07:14.596 --> 07:16.662

- Get those [bleep].

07:16.664 --> 07:18.731
Thanks for noticing.
Appreciate you.

07:18.733 --> 07:23.109
<i>- Come on, guys, come back here.
- Holy shit!</i>

07:24.534 --> 07:27.302
Aw, shit and stuff.
Here come uno time.

07:27.304 --> 07:28.670
Good afternoon, Officer.

07:28.672 --> 07:30.105
Would you care to purchase
a chocolate bar?

07:30.107 --> 07:31.906
Everybody knows the only bars

07:31.908 --> 07:34.342
your slangin' out here is Xanax.

07:34.344 --> 07:36.244
- Now spread 'em.
- Come on, Officer,

07:36.246 --> 07:38.012
I mean, m-maybe we can
work something out.

07:38.014 --> 07:41.082
Hmm. Be a good lad
and polish my tallywhacker?

07:41.084 --> 07:43.852
- Is that English?
- It means suck my [bleep], nigga, damn.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.487
'Trel?!

07:45.489 --> 07:49.290
I'm just [bleep] with you, lil' bro.
That'd be incest and gay.

07:49.292 --> 07:51.359
Hey! Why your brother
dressed like 5-0?

07:51.361 --> 07:53.695
Man, I ain't dressed
like nothing, Broke Chigga!

07:53.697 --> 07:56.964
- I am a cop.
- Montrel, you cannot just wake

07:56.965 --> 07:59.768
up at 3:00 in the afternoon
and decide to be a police officer.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.803
That's why I woke up at 2:15.

08:01.805 --> 08:06.207
Now gimme my allowance so I
can get some donuts nigga, damn.

08:06.209 --> 08:08.343
What it do, my piggas?

08:08.345 --> 08:09.944
Today's training day,
Officer Cummings.

08:09.946 --> 08:12.147
Actually, it's more like
training afternoon.

08:12.149 --> 08:14.182
Yeah, we had to plant
some drugs on minorities

08:14.184 --> 08:15.483
and the morning
kind of got away from us.

08:15.485 --> 08:16.718
Anyway, get in, Cummings.

08:21.224 --> 08:23.825
That's it!
I can't... run no more!

08:23.827 --> 08:25.627
This is stupid, my nigs.

08:25.629 --> 08:28.096
Stupid is gettin' lynched
by a bunch of cock-federates.

08:28.098 --> 08:30.498
It's all just pretend.
Can't we just, like,

08:30.500 --> 08:32.133
tell them we don't wanna
play no more?

08:32.135 --> 08:34.369
Whatcha gon' say?
"Sorry, we was just [bleep]

08:34.371 --> 08:35.970
with y'all when we
burned down y'all camp"?

08:35.972 --> 08:37.572
So what should we do?

08:38.707 --> 08:40.741
Keep running, Toby.

08:42.044 --> 08:43.878
<i>You know, there is
a back seat, Cummings.</i>

08:43.880 --> 08:45.880
Man, ain't no real one
gonna voluntarily

08:45.882 --> 08:48.416
- get in the back of a cop car.
- Totally understandable.

08:48.418 --> 08:51.152
Well, today we'll show you around,
give you a taste of the business.

08:51.154 --> 08:54.989
Starting with a little taste of this.
Your first lesson.

08:54.991 --> 08:57.392
Oh, okay. I feel you.
I feel what you talkin' about.

08:57.394 --> 09:00.328
If I go deep undercover,
my failure to use drugs

09:00.330 --> 09:03.231
- could get me killed by a street dealer.
- No. What?

09:03.233 --> 09:05.633
No, it makes the day
go by a shit ton faster.

09:05.635 --> 09:07.602
Oh, word?

09:09.973 --> 09:12.407
Maybe we should just split up.

09:12.409 --> 09:15.677
That's what they do in the movies.
They ain't after all of us.

09:15.679 --> 09:17.178
No, we all brothers in this.

09:17.180 --> 09:20.014
That's what this war about.
No man left behind.

09:20.016 --> 09:22.917
Damn.
See how y'all do me dirty?

09:29.059 --> 09:32.460
On the streets, you control
your smiles and cries

09:32.462 --> 09:36.030
because that's all you have
and nobody can take your smiles.

09:36.032 --> 09:39.834
Nobody can take...

09:39.836 --> 09:43.037
- Oh!
- Oh, crap, man, it's the fuzz.

09:43.039 --> 09:44.038
We gotta hide this shit.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.573
Nigga, where they at?
Oh, wait...

09:45.575 --> 09:46.908
We is the fuzz.

09:51.147 --> 09:52.480
Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo
check this out.

09:52.482 --> 09:56.117
- It's a 211 in progress.
- Already on it.

09:56.119 --> 09:58.319
- Hey, what you doing?
- Didn't you notice their guns?

09:58.321 --> 10:00.722
Lesson two: hit the gas
and save your ass.

10:02.492 --> 10:05.460
Gets me ever time.
Guy's in real pain right now.

10:08.598 --> 10:10.932
You know, I really thought
they'd follow Milk.

10:10.934 --> 10:14.269
Me, too.
They was mad at him, not us.

10:14.271 --> 10:16.905
I don't think I can run
anymore, my nig.

10:16.907 --> 10:18.907
Don't worry.

10:18.909 --> 10:21.743
We ain't got no choice.
We gots to jump.

10:21.745 --> 10:23.912
Hell, nah,
you know I can't swims.

10:23.914 --> 10:27.782
You already know I have
abnormally oxygenated blood cells,

10:27.784 --> 10:29.951
so I'm buoyant as a mother[bleep].

10:29.953 --> 10:32.120
Just hang onto me
when we hit the water.

10:41.898 --> 10:44.966
- What are you guys waiting for?
- Us? You go.

10:44.968 --> 10:46.467
This wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't brought

10:46.469 --> 10:49.404
"unapproved guests."

10:50.674 --> 10:52.774
We don't have time
to stand here bickering.

10:52.776 --> 10:55.343
We need to find Milton
so that I can save my marriage.

11:29.646 --> 11:32.213
Yo, why Uncle Joey
always so angry

11:32.215 --> 11:35.216
when he got Hunny's
scrumptious tittays

11:35.218 --> 11:37.352
- waitin' for him at home?
- Milk says because

11:37.354 --> 11:39.887
below the waist,
he workin' with a raw tater tot.

11:41.291 --> 11:46.027
I never understood why white guys
are always talking about dicks.

11:46.029 --> 11:48.196
For the same reason
we discovered America!

11:48.198 --> 11:51.199
We're curious!
You're in so much fake trouble

11:51.201 --> 11:54.002
for messing up our fake war.
So where's Milton?

11:54.004 --> 11:56.304
- We split up.
- We need to find my stepson.

11:56.306 --> 11:58.539
He's all alone in the woods.
What if he's lost?

11:58.541 --> 12:00.541
- What if he's hurt?
- But I thought you hated

12:00.543 --> 12:04.078
- that son of a bitch.
- I do, but I know he's alone in the woods.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.515
As much as I want to kill him,
I don't want anything to happen to him.

12:07.517 --> 12:10.351
Hunny will never forgive me
and she'll divorce me for sure.

12:10.353 --> 12:13.654
Now let's go find that wigger.

12:18.795 --> 12:21.696
Ah, shit.
Mark-ass tree.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.867
Who's there?
Uncle Joey?

12:25.869 --> 12:27.935
I mean, bitch-ass Uncle Joey?

12:27.937 --> 12:29.937
Come out and fight.
I ain't afraid.

12:29.939 --> 12:32.540
I got mad squabbles
and if you a pedophile...

12:32.542 --> 12:35.710
I got mad herpes
and my AIDS angry, too, homey.

12:38.114 --> 12:41.015
What's up, bitch-ass squirrel?

12:41.017 --> 12:43.718
You want some?
I'm the man up in this bitch.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.520
Who the [bleep] you think
you [bleep] with?

12:45.522 --> 12:46.954
I run shit around here.

12:46.956 --> 12:49.257
You just live here.
Yeah, that's right.

12:49.259 --> 12:53.194
You better run away.
King Kong ain't got shit on me.

12:55.098 --> 12:56.397
Oh, shit!
Ugh.

12:56.399 --> 12:58.866
Uncle Joey, help me!

12:58.868 --> 13:00.802
<i>Oh, Black Jesus, please no!</i>

13:00.804 --> 13:03.304
Ugh.

13:05.875 --> 13:10.745
Oh, you ain't so bad. For a minute
I thought you was finna...

13:19.428 --> 13:20.794
Here, give this
to one of your kids...

13:20.796 --> 13:24.197
that you know about
and acknowledge...

13:24.199 --> 13:28.106
- and take a fatherly role in their life.
- Cool. Cool.

13:28.107 --> 13:31.138
It's been a fun day, but when
do I get to shoot a nigga?

13:31.140 --> 13:33.206
You know, get a taste
of that paid leave.

13:33.208 --> 13:35.075
You believe this guy?
I didn't get my first

13:35.077 --> 13:37.711
- paycation for three weeks.
- It was four for me.

13:37.713 --> 13:39.980
And I'm an early bloomer.
Had a hairy dick at nine.

13:39.982 --> 13:42.449
This generation.
Everything has to happen

13:42.451 --> 13:43.950
right now for you millennials.

13:43.952 --> 13:46.219
Okay, you want to shoot
someone? You got it.

13:46.221 --> 13:47.888
Yeah, now that's what I'm
talking about.

13:47.890 --> 13:50.524
All right, we need to go where
there are a lot of black people.

13:50.526 --> 13:52.325
We got enough gas in here
to get to Detroit?

13:52.327 --> 13:55.061
No, but we do have enough to
get to the Magic Johnson Theater.

13:57.733 --> 14:01.073
I can't believe this shit.
Mark-ass bear.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.436
It's so not fair...
Bars!

14:06.241 --> 14:07.841
Mother[bleep].

14:09.478 --> 14:11.678
This time, we finish it.

14:13.549 --> 14:15.816
Guys, this is seriously messed up.

14:15.818 --> 14:17.250
How is this supposed to be fun?

14:17.252 --> 14:20.202
You guys pretending to
be Confederates isn't

14:20.203 --> 14:22.889
about pride.
You're just some born losers.

14:22.891 --> 14:24.724
I wasn't gonna let
my regiment do anything

14:24.726 --> 14:27.360
to you two before,
but now all bets are off.

14:27.362 --> 14:29.763
Hey, Dave,
you gotta come look at this.

14:29.765 --> 14:33.333
Well, I'll be damned.
Is this a 9/11 reenactment?

14:33.335 --> 14:34.901
Sure looks that way.

14:39.374 --> 14:42.142
Destroy our country?
Not on my watch.

14:42.144 --> 14:44.311
This time,
we go to fake war for real.

14:44.313 --> 14:46.246
- War?
- Was somebody talking shit

14:46.248 --> 14:48.515
- on Twitter?
- It's time for you Niagras

14:48.517 --> 14:50.083
to fight for your freedom.

14:50.085 --> 14:52.719
Fight for our freedom?
Why does this keep happening?

14:52.721 --> 14:56.723
- God, I hates America.
- Come on, guys, let's roll.

14:56.725 --> 15:00.193
What is wrong with you people?
9/11 was a heinous act

15:00.195 --> 15:02.262
and recreating it
is not only offensive,

15:02.264 --> 15:04.464
it is also
dumb and un-American.

15:04.466 --> 15:05.966
"Dumb and un-American," huh?

15:05.968 --> 15:07.701
Sounds pretty hypocritical from a guy

15:07.703 --> 15:09.769
wearing a Confederate Flag
on his uniform.

15:09.771 --> 15:11.771
- Got 'em!
- Hey!

15:11.773 --> 15:13.507
If you've got something
against America,

15:13.509 --> 15:16.743
I'll send you back to whatever
Middle Eastern compound

15:16.745 --> 15:19.079
you "Muslames" hide in, okay?

15:19.081 --> 15:21.882
"Middle Eastern compound"?
I'm from Laguna Beach.

15:21.884 --> 15:23.583
Get out of here!
I'm from Newport!

15:23.585 --> 15:26.953
- No kidding? East or west?
- Well, shit. You caught me.

15:26.955 --> 15:29.656
- I live in Anaheim.
- Ain't nothing wrong with that.

15:29.658 --> 15:31.758
- Go Halos!
- You're American?!

15:31.760 --> 15:34.928
That's even worse.
You're not terrorists, you're traitors.

15:34.930 --> 15:37.397
How could you celebrate
your own country's ass whooping?

15:37.399 --> 15:39.232
Apparently, the same way you guys do.

15:39.234 --> 15:41.835
This ass whoopin' brought us
together and made us stronger.

15:41.837 --> 15:45.906
- It's insensitive!
- Last I checked, this was still a free country.

15:45.908 --> 15:47.874
Oh, yeah?
Well, [bleep] your freedom!

15:47.876 --> 15:51.244
Oh, shit. 
Uncle Joey American Gansta.

15:51.246 --> 15:54.180
Yee-haw!

16:00.422 --> 16:01.788
What're you gonna do with that?

16:01.790 --> 16:05.692
- This is a reenactment, stupid.
- Reenactment?

16:08.430 --> 16:10.764
Man, the Confederates
are getting their asses kicked.

16:10.766 --> 16:12.899
No wonder the South lost, they suck.

16:12.901 --> 16:16.536
Yeah, they the Hillary Clintons
of the battlefield.

16:17.573 --> 16:21.575
- On your knees, infidels.
- Y'all gonna have to cut my head off

16:21.577 --> 16:25.845
- if you want me to suck some [bleep].
- Mmm, okay.

16:35.438 --> 16:37.624
Yeah, take that, buster, you like that?

16:37.626 --> 16:38.992
Yeah, you want some, too, homey?

16:45.067 --> 16:46.299
Yeah.

16:50.572 --> 16:53.106
Milton, are you okay?
What happened to you?

16:53.108 --> 16:55.175
I was "Revenated."
I'm good, though.

16:55.177 --> 16:57.277
It's not about who touches
you inappropriately,

16:57.279 --> 16:59.212
- it's what you do after.
- What?!

16:59.214 --> 17:02.315
Uh, uh... didn't nobody's cheeks
get smashed without consent.

17:13.829 --> 17:15.557
<i>Aw! Hell jeah!</i>

17:15.592 --> 17:17.763
That's what I'ma talking about.

17:17.765 --> 17:19.257
Yeah, buster!

17:24.071 --> 17:27.952
- Noo!
- Whoa!

17:30.379 --> 17:32.812
Pull it out! Pull it out!
Pull it out!

17:32.814 --> 17:35.315
That wasn't so bad.

17:35.317 --> 17:37.751
<i>Oh, man, that's nasty shit!</i>

17:37.753 --> 17:39.285
One of you busters do something!

17:39.287 --> 17:42.540
Uncle Joey finna bleed to
death outta his bitch-ass!

17:43.525 --> 17:45.925
Whoa! Wait a minute!

17:45.927 --> 17:48.161
Don't worry, Uncle Joey, I got you.

17:48.163 --> 17:50.697
That'll slow the bleeding
till we get back to camp.

17:50.699 --> 17:54.234
Damn, Milk. I gotta admit, what
you just did was pretty league,

17:54.236 --> 17:56.703
- but why you walkin' so funny?
- Uh...

17:58.106 --> 18:00.240
I can't believe Magic Johnson
theaters went tits up.

18:00.242 --> 18:03.209
Shit, we just missed last call
at Compton Leroy's too.

18:03.211 --> 18:05.957
Sorry, Cummings, looks like
it just ain't your night.

18:07.349 --> 18:09.616
Bingo! Looks like it was
your night after all.

18:09.618 --> 18:12.018
Freeze, nigga!

18:12.020 --> 18:14.879
- Shea?
- Aye, caa, you look cold in blue.

18:14.880 --> 18:18.091
- Drop the weapon!
- Aye, can a nigga eat his mint chips?

18:18.093 --> 18:19.626
- Stop resisting.
- Be careful.

18:19.628 --> 18:21.761
This one has both of his arms.

18:21.763 --> 18:23.797
- He's reaching for something.
- Go for it, Cummings!

18:23.799 --> 18:26.900
- Man, he ain't nobody.
- I am somebody, caa.

18:26.902 --> 18:29.335
Hey, shut up.
If you wanna go get some niggas,

18:29.337 --> 18:31.771
I know where we can find
a pack of them mother[bleep]s.

18:31.773 --> 18:34.674
Come on! Bust your
chocolate covered cherry!

18:35.281 --> 18:37.877
Oh, I see.
I knew it was gonna happen

18:37.879 --> 18:40.480
some day, caa.
Might as well be you, 'Trel.

18:40.482 --> 18:42.248
Just make sure you keep me
hashtaggin'.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.317
Crip lives matter, call.

18:44.319 --> 18:46.686
No, they don't, blood.
And I think I speak for all cops

18:46.688 --> 18:50.924
- everywhere when I say su-wu.
- Coming at you, 'Pac.

19:01.813 --> 19:04.848
You said you wanted to shoot a nigga,
who'd a thought it'd be you?

19:04.850 --> 19:07.283
Aye, I had to do it.
I couldn't shoot my homey.

19:07.285 --> 19:09.819
- You like my family.
- Damn, caa, that's deep.

19:09.821 --> 19:12.589
Aye, I gotta tell you somethin',
you know that bad one

19:12.591 --> 19:15.125
you had from Diamond Bar?
I [bleep] her, caa.

19:15.127 --> 19:17.227
- I'm a bad friend.
- Man, you did what?!

19:17.229 --> 19:19.937
Ah, caa.
My Crippin' leg!

19:19.972 --> 19:22.399
That's for [bleep] my bad one
from Diamond Bar, nigga.

19:22.401 --> 19:24.467
- Don't never do that shit again.
- Fair enough, caa.

19:24.469 --> 19:26.503
Aye, can a nigga have
some Obamacares?

19:26.505 --> 19:29.973
Damn, my nig,
being a slave is hard work.

19:29.975 --> 19:33.143
I don't know how our ancestors
did it for 12 years.

19:33.145 --> 19:35.512
<i>Well, I'm glad you guys got along.</i>

19:35.514 --> 19:40.216
Yeah, I guess your husband is all
right for a mark-ass buster.

19:40.218 --> 19:43.086
<i>I'm so happy.
And you know what I like to do</i>

19:43.088 --> 19:45.155
<i>when I'm happy?</i>

19:45.157 --> 19:47.424
Oh!
Uh, yeah... about that.

19:47.426 --> 19:49.926
Uh, I don't think I can do that
for about six weeks.

19:49.928 --> 19:52.829
I'll explain when I get home.
Love ya, Hunny Bunny.

19:52.831 --> 19:55.398
- So, Milton, how you doing?
- I ain't get assaulted!

19:55.400 --> 19:58.161
What? I wasn't... I...
All right, anyway,

19:58.162 --> 19:59.757
I'm glad you're okay.

20:00.439 --> 20:03.525
Even though you're a mark-ass
buster, I still love your money.

20:03.526 --> 20:04.808
Thanks for having my back.

20:04.810 --> 20:08.311
That's what fathers do.
We protect the ones we love.

20:08.313 --> 20:11.047
- And their kids.
- Whoa, pump them brakes,

20:11.049 --> 20:14.250
bitch-ass Dave.
No one said you was my daddy.

20:14.252 --> 20:17.320
- Yo, why you smiling?
- You called me Dave.

20:17.322 --> 20:19.255
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

20:19.257 --> 20:22.826
How cute.
Someone loves their stepdad.

20:22.828 --> 20:27.564
- Shut up, buster.
- Aww, look who's got a father in his life.

20:27.566 --> 20:30.366
Man, y'all take it back.
I already killed once today.

20:30.368 --> 20:32.335
Your mom's gonna be so happy.

20:32.337 --> 20:35.638
I can't wait to get home so we
can be a "Full House" again.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.475
Come here. Give me
a big, ol' bear hug, son.

20:38.477 --> 20:40.443
No means no!
No means no!

20:40.445 --> 20:42.512
Man, quit playing, Uncle Joey!
You ain't my daddy.

20:42.514 --> 20:44.347
I done told you that man.
