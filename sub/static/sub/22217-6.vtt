WEBVTT

00:00.053 --> 00:02.968
- <i>Previously on</i> Dynasty...
<i>- Your father offered me</i>

00:02.969 --> 00:05.404
- the COO position.
- That was supposed to be mine.

00:05.406 --> 00:06.538
With Jeff's backing, I will be

00:06.540 --> 00:09.708
chief strategy officer
of Carrington Windbriar.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.476
I've recently started my own company,

00:11.478 --> 00:13.912
which I am building from the ground up,
on my own.

00:13.914 --> 00:15.013
<i>I thought we were building this</i>

00:15.015 --> 00:16.047
together.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.382
Maybe I need to rethink

00:17.384 --> 00:19.518
if Morell Corp. is the type of
company I want to be a part of.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.786
<i>Cristal Carrington's</i>

00:20.788 --> 00:22.554
sex tape, is that real?

00:22.556 --> 00:23.822
<i>Oh, it's real.</i>

00:23.824 --> 00:26.425
You leaked the tape.
Let me be the first to toast

00:26.427 --> 00:27.826
Fallon Carrington.

00:28.629 --> 00:29.995
I want you out of this house.

00:30.879 --> 00:34.466
Kori, this is Michael Culhane.
He's a friend.

00:34.468 --> 00:35.354
A single friend?

00:35.369 --> 00:37.210
Kori just hates me because
I was a bitch in high school.

00:37.272 --> 00:40.105
You're like a human bulldozer.
You'll crush anyone.

00:40.107 --> 00:41.440
What I did was wrong.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.642
<i>Not just my relationship with Matthew,</i>

00:43.644 --> 00:46.011
but continuing the lie after he died.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.613
<i>It was no accident!</i>

00:48.615 --> 00:50.349
You killed my husband!

00:50.351 --> 00:52.050
Has Cristal already gone to bed?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.652
She's paying Mrs. Blaisdel a visit.

00:53.654 --> 00:54.786
Oh, I have to get over there.

00:54.788 --> 00:55.754
What are you doing here?

00:55.756 --> 00:57.456
Claudia, can I please speak with you?

00:57.458 --> 00:59.257
My husband is dead!

00:59.259 --> 01:01.660
You are gonna pay for
the pain that you caused!

01:09.403 --> 01:11.903
<i>Carrington residence.</i>

01:11.905 --> 01:14.773
Oh, that is encouraging, sir.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.542
No, just me a-and the man-child.

01:18.254 --> 01:19.386
Of course.

01:19.445 --> 01:21.230
I don't know if you can
hear me over the sound

01:21.248 --> 01:22.848
of your digestive tract.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.083
You'll be relieved to
know that Mr. Carrington

01:25.085 --> 01:27.085
and your aunt will be home soon.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.487
Claudia Blaisdel's condition is stable.

01:28.980 --> 01:30.022
What a nightmare.

01:30.024 --> 01:32.024
I'll light a candle at church.

01:32.026 --> 01:33.125
Did Cristal say

01:33.127 --> 01:34.493
if she was gonna be home in time

01:34.495 --> 01:36.395
to take me shopping
for my interview suit?

01:36.397 --> 01:37.562
She failed to mention that.

01:37.564 --> 01:40.265
Ah, I see you've taken
my advice to heart.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.833
Is that a résumé?

01:41.835 --> 01:43.101
In progress.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.369
"Bilingual."

01:44.371 --> 01:46.071
I suppose you are.

01:46.073 --> 01:48.206
I'm not sure about
"drug or disease free."

01:48.208 --> 01:50.375
You're supposed to add little
flourishes to your résumé.

01:50.377 --> 01:52.911
Well, perhaps
you should add "wizard of lies."

01:52.913 --> 01:53.912
That wouldn't be a flourish.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.347
- Good morning to you, too.
- Supposed to

01:55.349 --> 01:57.416
go over the Foundation
grant proposals with Dad.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.817
Is he still at the hospital?

01:58.819 --> 01:59.985
Home soon.

01:59.987 --> 02:01.686
Uh, you should wait
30 minutes after eating

02:01.688 --> 02:03.722
before you challenge your father.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.791
You might get a cramp.

02:06.635 --> 02:08.960
Or thrown out, like your sister.

02:09.993 --> 02:10.929
I know you told me

02:10.931 --> 02:12.097
that you weren't going to hate me,

02:12.099 --> 02:15.067
but you might want to tell your face.

02:15.069 --> 02:16.301
There's a hell of a lot of distance

02:16.303 --> 02:18.737
between hate and friendship.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.806
You've got some miles to go.

02:26.112 --> 02:28.380
Well, party's over.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.048
I've been kicked out for less.

02:30.050 --> 02:32.651
No, your protests cost Dad
hundreds of millions of dollars,

02:32.653 --> 02:34.152
not to mention legal fees.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.454
What I did was just a prank.

02:35.456 --> 02:36.655
Kids pull pranks.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.157
You weaponized a sex tape of Dad's wife.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.425
You're lucky they're not suing you.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.994
Lucky?
I have to go live at The Ritz, Steven.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.863
Before you get your
martyr status verified

02:44.865 --> 02:46.331
with a little blue check mark,

02:46.333 --> 02:48.100
you might want to remember it
wasn't just Cristal you betrayed

02:48.102 --> 02:49.701
when you leaked that tape.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.103
What, you're siding with Daddy?

02:51.105 --> 02:53.305
You were so focused on
yourself and hurting Cristal,

02:53.307 --> 02:54.806
you didn't stop to think
about how it might affect

02:54.808 --> 02:55.974
our relationship?

02:55.976 --> 02:57.876
One thing I'll say, being out on my own

02:57.878 --> 02:59.411
really helped me grow up.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.912
And yet, now you're back
at the same company

03:00.914 --> 03:02.293
you criticized for years?

03:02.316 --> 03:04.583
The company takes, the Foundation gives.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.985
I've got a chance to
course-correct our legacy.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.220
But I wouldn't expect you to understand

03:08.222 --> 03:09.754
the concept of greater good.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.558
Steven.

03:14.608 --> 03:17.429
Can someone please help me with my bags?

03:23.398 --> 03:25.036
Surprised you still came in.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.738
I didn't think our cover
girl had time to spare

03:26.740 --> 03:28.206
from her self-promotion tour.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.208
And I didn't realize you
held grudges so hard.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.477
Look, we were just leaving.

03:32.479 --> 03:33.983
I'm busy scouting new investments.

03:34.048 --> 03:36.615
Well, don't you think
assets should take priority?

03:36.617 --> 03:38.517
Is that what you think
you are to me, Fallon?

03:38.519 --> 03:41.353
'Cause Morell Corp.
feels more like a liability.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.323
Could you excuse us for a minute,
please?

03:45.325 --> 03:46.825
Of course.

03:46.827 --> 03:49.828
I realize that we aren't profitable yet.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.463
But we will be very soon.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.465
You keep saying that.
But beyond profits,

03:53.467 --> 03:55.233
I'm worried about us.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.401
W-What do you mean, "us"?

03:56.403 --> 03:58.170
Exactly. With that attitude,

03:58.172 --> 04:00.805
I'm not sure I should be in
business with you at all.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.407
Well, obviously, the answer is yes.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.575
Let's talk later.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.678
Okay? Have LaNique try and
fit you in my schedule.

04:06.680 --> 04:10.215
I just hope it won't make
the launch party awkward.

04:11.185 --> 04:12.751
- What launch party?
- The one I'm planning,

04:12.753 --> 04:14.920
to introduce us to the energy community.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.387
Government regulators,
strategic partners,

04:16.390 --> 04:18.055
international buyers.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.690
People we need to be in business with.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.259
"We."

04:21.261 --> 04:23.261
And did you just come up with this idea?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.596
God, no. I've been thinking about it

04:24.598 --> 04:25.797
for the last two minutes.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.032
Look, Jeff.

04:28.140 --> 04:30.602
This is the only thing going
right in my life, okay?

04:30.604 --> 04:32.204
That's why I've taken so much ownership.

04:32.206 --> 04:33.939
But I want this for you, too.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.240
I'm committed to you.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.741
Just let me prove it.

04:37.578 --> 04:38.877
Last shot.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.379
Thank you.

04:41.381 --> 04:43.548
And one last thing,
the party's at your house

04:43.550 --> 04:46.218
'cause I got kicked out of mine.

04:54.715 --> 04:56.928
Yeah, it's been over 12 hours.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.363
Besides donating a kidney,

04:58.365 --> 05:01.199
I don't think there's anything
more we can do for her.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.602
Maybe give her a friendly face
to look at when she wakes up?

05:03.604 --> 05:05.003
We already saved her from that Obamacare

05:05.005 --> 05:06.943
waiting room nightmare downstairs.

05:06.978 --> 05:08.006
I think we're covered.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.675
Blake, a check isn't gonna
be enough this time.

05:10.677 --> 05:12.711
We have to be by Claudia's side.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.512
The only thing we need to
do is make sure this woman,

05:14.514 --> 05:16.829
who has already proven
herself to be highly volatile,

05:16.864 --> 05:19.050
doesn't sue us for half
of Carrington Atlantic,

05:19.052 --> 05:21.152
or put me in jail for
attempted vehicular homicide.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.120
Shh.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.323
If the Carringtons are here,

05:25.325 --> 05:27.325
this must be my funeral.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.829
You're in a suite at the hospital,
Claudia.

05:31.521 --> 05:32.635
How are you feeling?

05:32.670 --> 05:36.401
Like someone hit me with 3,000
pounds of European metal.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.303
We can get you some pain medication.

05:38.305 --> 05:39.671
Maybe a morphine drip?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.339
No, I can't have morphine.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.308
Did they not tell you?

05:44.478 --> 05:45.910
Ah, Danzette.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.012
- Thank you for coming in.
- Ah.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.713
Any friend of yours.

05:48.715 --> 05:53.084
Uh, we should be able to get you out
by this afternoon, Mrs. Blaisdel.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.552
Well, that-that seems so fast.

05:54.554 --> 05:56.321
Well, her, uh, injuries are minor.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.989
The bone bruises will take
a little while to heal,

05:57.991 --> 06:00.892
but, uh, most importantly,
the baby's fine.

06:01.728 --> 06:03.662
- Baby?
- She's pregnant?

06:04.464 --> 06:06.998
Why didn't you tell us?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.266
With Matthew's death, I wasn't rushing

06:08.268 --> 06:09.634
to put out birth announcements.

06:09.636 --> 06:10.769
I'll, uh...

06:10.771 --> 06:14.005
get the discharge papers started.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.573
Do you have someone to drive you home?

06:18.109 --> 06:19.210
We'll take her home.

06:19.729 --> 06:20.679
To the manor.

06:20.681 --> 06:21.479
What?

06:21.481 --> 06:23.148
No, she has help.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.950
It's not the same as a house
full of people to care for her.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.253
Just until you recuperate.

06:28.255 --> 06:31.356
Our histories aside, you have
someone else to think about now.

06:31.358 --> 06:32.757
It's settled.

06:32.759 --> 06:35.160
You're staying with us.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:45.000 --> 06:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:56.473 --> 06:57.651
Anything ours is yours,

06:57.653 --> 06:59.486
and whatever else you may need,

06:59.488 --> 07:02.322
these are the people
that can get it for you.

07:02.324 --> 07:04.291
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- Nonsense.

07:04.293 --> 07:05.759
Can we please put her in the east wing,
with us?

07:05.761 --> 07:06.994
Yes, ma'am.

07:06.996 --> 07:08.695
We'll be right down the hall.

07:15.771 --> 07:17.838
- Burn this.
- Anders.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.307
We can find her another sweater,
dip it in oatmeal.

07:20.309 --> 07:22.109
It's quite an array of
strays you're collecting.

07:22.111 --> 07:23.543
The responsible thing

07:23.545 --> 07:25.312
would be to spay and neuter them.

07:25.314 --> 07:26.580
Anders.

07:26.582 --> 07:28.215
Claudia is pregnant.

07:28.217 --> 07:29.383
Oh, God.

07:29.385 --> 07:30.917
Well, I hope
she doesn't stay till the birth.

07:30.919 --> 07:34.187
I am long past my diapering days.

07:35.391 --> 07:37.124
For the record, I'm with Claudia.

07:37.126 --> 07:38.659
This was a terrible idea.

07:38.661 --> 07:41.395
Yeah. You've only
mentioned it five times now.

07:41.397 --> 07:43.163
Because I thought we had closed the door

07:43.165 --> 07:44.931
on all things Matthew and Claudia,

07:44.933 --> 07:46.299
so we could move on.

07:46.301 --> 07:48.035
And then you went and ran her over.

07:48.037 --> 07:50.103
Claudia is pregnant, Blake.

07:50.105 --> 07:51.638
Does that mean nothing to you?

07:51.640 --> 07:53.273
Not unless it's mine.

07:54.009 --> 07:55.442
Look, I am just concerned.

07:55.444 --> 07:56.743
This woman is unwell.

07:56.745 --> 07:57.878
Not to mention a liability.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.246
Even more reason why we
should look after her.

07:59.248 --> 08:01.815
Have you considered why
she would agree to move in?

08:01.817 --> 08:03.250
After everything we've put her through?

08:03.252 --> 08:05.686
If it were me,
I'd be looking for any hint of dirt

08:05.688 --> 08:06.920
that I could use against us.

08:06.922 --> 08:08.562
That's because you're enterprising.

08:08.597 --> 08:11.158
Claudia is alone. We owe her.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.160
I want to do this.

08:13.162 --> 08:14.561
Well, I don't know how you can.

08:14.563 --> 08:17.330
I can't spare my COO to
become a full-time caregiver.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.000
I am a modern woman, Blake.

08:20.002 --> 08:22.569
I can handle it all.

08:27.710 --> 08:29.142
<i>Your office is coming together.</i>

08:29.144 --> 08:32.712
Only you would plan a party in
24 hours just to prove a point.

08:32.715 --> 08:34.347
Well, it's a launch party.
It's supposed to be fast.

08:34.349 --> 08:35.515
We're blasting off.

08:35.517 --> 08:36.683
Why are you really doing it?

08:36.684 --> 08:38.118
To give the company the
attention it deserves,

08:38.120 --> 08:39.653
to woo new clients.

08:39.655 --> 08:40.754
Mm-hmm.

08:40.756 --> 08:42.089
Why are you always mm-hmming me?

08:42.091 --> 08:43.924
I just think it's a strange
coincidence that you flake out

08:43.926 --> 08:45.425
on my brother more than once,

08:45.427 --> 08:47.227
but then Kori hooks up with this driver

08:47.229 --> 08:49.496
who you were
"totally not having sex with",

08:49.498 --> 08:52.099
and suddenly you're refocused
on Jeff with a vengeance.

08:52.101 --> 08:53.467
You go where the attention is.

08:53.469 --> 08:55.235
- That's so off.
- Mm-hmm.

08:55.237 --> 08:57.203
Okay. Are you gonna
help me plan this or no?

08:57.714 --> 08:59.673
Okay.

08:59.675 --> 09:01.174
Where's Caroline Corpuz?

09:01.176 --> 09:03.110
And Marc Hidoko?

09:04.113 --> 09:05.579
Or any of Jeff's contacts?

09:05.581 --> 09:07.848
Well, I need to control the vibe,
introduce him to bigwigs

09:07.850 --> 09:09.282
we need to be in business with.

09:09.284 --> 09:11.418
Jeff took a lot of losses
in the startup space,

09:11.420 --> 09:14.054
which makes a lot of his
former clients losers.

09:14.056 --> 09:16.389
And you could be one of them
if you don't play things right.

09:16.391 --> 09:17.624
And plus, this is tech.

09:17.626 --> 09:20.060
Losers turn into winners with one idea.

09:20.062 --> 09:22.395
Fine. Fine, I'll invite Jeff's contacts.

09:22.397 --> 09:25.465
See? You <i> can</i> be a team player.

09:25.467 --> 09:27.334
Next week, we'll work on tact.

09:27.336 --> 09:28.502
Mm-hmm.

09:30.105 --> 09:32.906
You might want to be sober for this one.

09:35.177 --> 09:38.078
Well, I see your Haitian
wells and your carbon eaters,

09:38.080 --> 09:40.247
but where are my more
conservative charities?

09:40.249 --> 09:42.349
I want to take the Foundation
in a new direction.

09:42.351 --> 09:43.517
Left.

09:43.519 --> 09:44.785
Why am I not surprised?

09:44.787 --> 09:47.354
You know,
we were already doing a lot of good.

09:47.356 --> 09:49.489
But you probably couldn't see
that through the fake news

09:49.491 --> 09:52.092
swirling around your liberal bubble.

09:52.094 --> 09:54.094
There's nothing fake about homelessness,

09:54.096 --> 09:56.196
uh, climate change, police brutality.

09:56.198 --> 09:59.332
There's no cure for laziness,
propaganda and ignorance.

09:59.334 --> 10:02.235
That may be the worst thing
I've ever heard you say.

10:02.237 --> 10:04.070
I don't know what kind of
monster you think I am...

10:04.072 --> 10:05.305
or maybe I do...

10:05.307 --> 10:07.274
but the Foundation was actually growing

10:07.276 --> 10:09.810
while you were off on your
little socialist Rumspringa.

10:09.812 --> 10:10.977
Just because I was out in the world

10:10.979 --> 10:12.813
with a different
political agenda to yours

10:12.815 --> 10:14.080
doesn't mean I was playing games.

10:14.082 --> 10:16.716
And there's no reason
for you to start now.

10:18.238 --> 10:20.387
If your charities do
all this great work,

10:20.389 --> 10:21.755
pitch them to me.

10:21.757 --> 10:23.323
Be their advocate.

10:23.325 --> 10:25.091
Let's hear all about
where your money goes.

10:25.093 --> 10:26.960
If you even know.

10:28.764 --> 10:31.598
I've been in sales the past 30 years.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.266
I've been managing this charity

10:33.268 --> 10:35.001
since before you were born.

10:35.003 --> 10:37.037
And now you want to
challenge me on both?

10:37.039 --> 10:38.572
I'll show you I'm right.

10:38.574 --> 10:39.739
What are you gonna do?
Make me a diorama?

10:39.741 --> 10:42.108
No, I'm gonna let you
see with your own eyes

10:42.110 --> 10:43.310
how these charities work.

10:43.312 --> 10:44.711
Then you can judge.

10:49.184 --> 10:51.117
Hi.

10:51.119 --> 10:52.686
There you are.

10:52.688 --> 10:55.055
I called into the office and
I had them clear my schedule

10:55.057 --> 10:56.356
so I could show you around.

10:56.358 --> 10:57.791
Great.

10:57.793 --> 10:59.926
You can give me a tour
of the Ming dynasty.

10:59.928 --> 11:01.695
So are all these urns filled with

11:01.697 --> 11:03.663
other people that Blake has run over?

11:05.200 --> 11:06.700
So what can I show you?

11:07.601 --> 11:09.469
It took me a while to
get my bearings here.

11:09.471 --> 11:11.004
The first week,
I got lost in the wine cellar

11:11.006 --> 11:13.073
and ended up on the shooting range.

11:13.688 --> 11:16.042
Champagne problems, I guess.

11:16.044 --> 11:18.078
Mine are a lot less complicated.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.412
I'm here because

11:19.414 --> 11:21.748
it makes sense for my recovery.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.516
Not to make you feel better.

11:25.320 --> 11:27.320
Oh, hi, Bo.

11:27.322 --> 11:29.122
Hi.

11:29.124 --> 11:30.190
I wasn't really a dog person before,

11:30.192 --> 11:33.894
but Bo has stolen my heart.

11:33.896 --> 11:35.795
He follows me everywhere.

11:35.797 --> 11:37.264
It must be nice to have a dog

11:37.266 --> 11:39.132
that you don't have to clean up after.

11:39.134 --> 11:42.435
I'm sure you have people for that,
with your army of staff.

11:42.437 --> 11:44.738
Yeah, that's another thing that
took a second to get used to.

11:44.740 --> 11:47.407
Especially when you grow
up working class, like us.

11:47.409 --> 11:48.975
Right.

11:48.977 --> 11:51.044
We have so much in common.

11:53.949 --> 11:55.849
Uh, I got to get this. It's work.

11:55.851 --> 11:56.883
Excuse me.

11:57.958 --> 11:59.148
Cristal Carrington.

11:59.183 --> 11:59.953
<i>Can't.</i>

11:59.955 --> 12:01.454
- I'm busy.
- Sam, I got to go in.

12:01.456 --> 12:02.822
There was a leak on an offshore rig.

12:02.824 --> 12:04.758
I need to coordinate the
environmental response,

12:04.760 --> 12:06.960
reroute supply, manage the press...

12:06.962 --> 12:08.528
So take the crazy lady with you.

12:08.530 --> 12:09.796
I can't do that.

12:09.798 --> 12:11.631
Look, I told Blake that
I'd be responsible for her,

12:11.633 --> 12:12.933
but I wouldn't shirk my job.

12:12.935 --> 12:14.334
So you're asking me to babysit?

12:14.336 --> 12:16.002
I need a real job.

12:16.004 --> 12:17.637
And I have a better
chance at getting one

12:17.639 --> 12:19.105
in something couture.

12:19.107 --> 12:20.507
Right now this is your job.

12:20.509 --> 12:23.643
Keep Claudia company,
make her comfortable,

12:23.645 --> 12:25.178
and give her whatever she wants.

12:25.180 --> 12:26.947
So how much does crazy-sitting pay?

12:26.949 --> 12:27.914
Damn it, Sam.

12:27.916 --> 12:29.616
- Nothing's free,<i> Tía.</i>
- Right.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.084
I mean, just the roof over your head

12:31.086 --> 12:33.520
and an all-you-can-eat buffet,
but fine...

12:33.522 --> 12:35.494
Consider this your expense account.

12:35.529 --> 12:37.757
Do not tell Blake.

12:37.759 --> 12:40.093
Here's her pill schedule.

12:40.095 --> 12:42.195
You have to really keep
an eye on her, okay?

12:42.197 --> 12:43.930
She is a handful.

12:43.932 --> 12:45.598
Best cure for crazy is crazy money.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.100
Do not get carried away, Sam.

12:47.102 --> 12:48.535
Me?

12:48.537 --> 12:49.469
Never.

12:49.471 --> 12:51.705
Ay.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.123
What? Is it too much?

13:13.125 --> 13:14.391
All of it's too much.

13:14.393 --> 13:15.492
They're getting paid, sweetie.

13:15.494 --> 13:17.461
They do not mind.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.463
And how often do you get to
see how the one percent lives?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.131
Or how they live with themselves?

13:24.970 --> 13:26.103
No, I can't.

13:26.105 --> 13:27.971
Babies are such a drag.

13:29.341 --> 13:31.875
if anyone should be taking
advantage of all this, it's you.

13:31.877 --> 13:34.044
They hit you with their rich people car.

13:34.046 --> 13:36.346
Take what you deserve.

13:38.130 --> 13:39.216
It's payback.

13:40.085 --> 13:42.252
Mmm.

14:27.104 --> 14:28.031
Ah...

14:28.033 --> 14:30.767
I don't remember the last
time I had actual fun.

14:31.549 --> 14:33.003
My head is spinning.

14:33.005 --> 14:34.871
I think I forgot to give you your pills.

14:34.873 --> 14:36.707
Kidding.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.009
But you can see how people get
addicted to this lifestyle.

14:39.011 --> 14:41.278
I mean, imagine
living like this every day.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.046
I can't even imagine.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.482
Your aunt must have a fabulous closet.

14:45.484 --> 14:47.684
Oh, it's bigger than the
apartment I grew up in.

14:49.788 --> 14:51.888
Want to see it?

14:54.326 --> 14:56.326
Should've figured the Foundation
would support a boxing club.

14:56.328 --> 14:58.428
I know, I know,
you thought you were headed

14:58.430 --> 15:00.597
to an NRA youth self-defense course.

15:00.599 --> 15:01.898
Also in your wheelhouse.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.301
We have been helping the
Meadowlark Athletic Club

15:04.303 --> 15:05.369
for over ten years

15:05.371 --> 15:06.937
and donated over a million dollars.

15:06.939 --> 15:09.640
You know I have mixed feelings
about children boxing...

15:09.642 --> 15:11.208
It's a miracle I didn't
end up with brain damage.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.310
Well, maybe that explains
how you ended up a liberal.

15:13.312 --> 15:14.344
I'm serious.

15:14.346 --> 15:16.046
Which is why we never make contact

15:16.048 --> 15:17.948
without headgear.

15:17.950 --> 15:20.317
I'm Phil, I'm the director here.

15:20.319 --> 15:21.685
Blake's got me up to speed
on your big decision, Steven,

15:21.687 --> 15:24.187
so be prepared for me
to lay it on thick.

15:24.189 --> 15:25.255
No need.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.890
I can see the value
in a place like this,

15:26.892 --> 15:28.191
but the sport...

15:28.193 --> 15:29.993
It's changing lives for the better.

15:29.995 --> 15:32.329
Yeah, a prime example is,
uh, Rudy over here.

15:32.331 --> 15:33.497
Before she came here,

15:33.499 --> 15:35.543
she was bullied so
bad she wasn't eating.

15:35.578 --> 15:36.566
Luckily, she landed here

15:36.568 --> 15:39.136
and learned how to box...
not to knock out her bullies,

15:39.138 --> 15:40.537
but to take back the power

15:40.539 --> 15:43.573
she felt they stole from her. Hey, Rudy.

15:43.575 --> 15:44.775
Rudy, I want to introduce you

15:44.777 --> 15:47.711
to two of our club's biggest donors:
Blake and Steven Carrington.

15:47.713 --> 15:49.246
That's some impressive footwork,
young lady.

15:49.248 --> 15:50.380
You think the feet are nice?

15:50.382 --> 15:51.715
You should see me throw these hands.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.617
She's got a fight tomorrow.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.751
You guys should come out.

15:54.753 --> 15:56.620
Yeah, watch me
whoop up on this little girl.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.688
Count me in.

15:57.690 --> 15:58.855
You got to love a girl with confidence.

16:00.759 --> 16:02.292
You think going a few rounds
with me would be tough?

16:02.294 --> 16:03.694
I should stick you in the ring with her.

16:05.097 --> 16:07.297
This is Cristal's closet?

16:08.367 --> 16:10.267
Coco Chanel said, look at yourself

16:10.269 --> 16:12.574
in the mirror and take
at least one thing off

16:12.609 --> 16:13.556
before you leave the house.

16:13.591 --> 16:15.322
I say, add five more.

16:15.357 --> 16:16.520
How about a hat?

16:16.555 --> 16:17.517
Yes.

16:17.552 --> 16:20.310
We wear the same size shoes.

16:21.680 --> 16:22.879
Let's see.

16:26.351 --> 16:27.818
Final touch.

16:30.355 --> 16:31.788
Yas. Work!

16:37.062 --> 16:38.095
Where's Cristal?

16:38.097 --> 16:39.696
- Uh...
- Uh, Cristal told me

16:39.698 --> 16:40.864
to give Claudia anything she wants,

16:40.866 --> 16:42.666
and I was just following
her to make sure...

16:42.668 --> 16:44.034
Is that my watch?

16:45.671 --> 16:48.171
Relax, I wasn't going to steal it.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.040
I'm sorry, this was my idea.

16:50.042 --> 16:52.576
I shouldn't have gone
into your wife's things.

16:52.578 --> 16:55.278
It's just... it's been such a long time

16:55.280 --> 16:57.114
since I've dressed up, and...

16:57.116 --> 16:59.382
It was silly, really,
like kids in a closet.

17:01.253 --> 17:05.188
I forgot about the rest
of the world for a moment.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.257
It was nice to forget.

17:09.550 --> 17:10.770
It's okay.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.430
I'm sorry.

17:14.397 --> 17:15.598
No, it-it's all right.

17:15.601 --> 17:16.933
You-You've been through a lot.

17:17.892 --> 17:19.136
Let's get you back to your room.

17:20.539 --> 17:21.972
Oh.

17:21.973 --> 17:24.974
No, no, you... you keep it.

17:25.695 --> 17:27.109
You're beautiful.

17:31.116 --> 17:32.949
Okay.

17:32.951 --> 17:35.118
I've been getting texts all day.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.386
People are excited to come out.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.588
Well, here's the menu;
the chef's a friend of mine.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.690
And I got the mixologist
from Establishment.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.325
Ah. Nice.

17:42.327 --> 17:44.761
And the guest list?

17:44.763 --> 17:45.962
You know who we should add?

17:45.964 --> 17:47.364
Johnny Davis and Brayden Webb.

17:47.366 --> 17:48.932
I just heard they were in town.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.567
- They founded the...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:50.569 --> 17:51.735
I know who they are.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.136
I tried to poach them when I was at C.A.

17:53.138 --> 17:55.272
I took them to
Staplehouse's opening night,

17:55.274 --> 17:57.040
and then, in the middle of dinner,
they turned me down.

17:57.042 --> 17:59.075
I went ballistic.
I'm surprised you didn't hear about it.

17:59.077 --> 18:00.210
They might have mentioned it

18:00.212 --> 18:02.012
in the cover story Fast
Company did on them.

18:02.014 --> 18:04.447
Something about you threatening
to eat one of them alive

18:04.449 --> 18:07.184
and crush the other into "nerd sauce".

18:07.186 --> 18:08.685
Okay, well, I'm not wrong.

18:08.687 --> 18:11.154
I mean, these guys think pocket
protectors are high fashion.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.957
All I know is,
they developed a super efficient battery

18:13.959 --> 18:16.560
we need desperately for
energy storage at Windbriar.

18:16.562 --> 18:18.728
Well, I try
not to operate from desperation.

18:18.730 --> 18:21.765
Yeah, well, I want them there.

18:23.202 --> 18:24.167
It's on you.

18:24.169 --> 18:25.936
What's more important?

18:25.938 --> 18:28.071
Your pride or this company?

18:35.781 --> 18:37.280
Claudia.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.549
Was just checking to see
how you're settling in.

18:40.676 --> 18:43.820
Uh, well as can be,
given the circumstances.

18:43.822 --> 18:45.922
Life is so strange.

18:45.924 --> 18:48.558
To have you, of all people,
taking care of me.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.094
Well, we're all happy to
be in a position to help.

18:51.096 --> 18:53.029
A year ago, we didn't know each other.

18:53.031 --> 18:56.132
A few days ago,
I would've been at your throat.

18:56.134 --> 18:57.267
Life can turn on a dime.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.002
Change your entire world.

18:59.004 --> 19:00.303
Especially getting pregnant.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.738
I can only imagine.

19:02.979 --> 19:04.207
You live in a mansion,

19:04.209 --> 19:06.209
with a staff of servants to help.

19:06.211 --> 19:07.677
I'm all alone at this now.

19:07.679 --> 19:08.912
You're not alone, Claudia.

19:08.914 --> 19:11.047
Y-You're not my friend or my family.

19:11.049 --> 19:12.716
I'm so sorry.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.951
I know Matthew would've
been an amazing...

19:14.953 --> 19:16.052
Father?

19:16.054 --> 19:17.787
Right.

19:17.789 --> 19:19.589
I bet you don't even think
that this is his baby.

19:19.591 --> 19:20.590
Well, you know what?

19:20.592 --> 19:22.359
There's no need to call Maury,

19:22.361 --> 19:24.628
because even though we
lived our separate lives,

19:24.630 --> 19:26.129
we still came home to the same bed.

19:26.131 --> 19:28.465
And we never stopped sleeping together.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.734
Oh, does that surprise you?

19:30.736 --> 19:32.769
Or does it just drive you
a little crazy knowing that

19:32.771 --> 19:34.838
there is a little piece
of him still inside me?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.706
A piece you can't steal.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.308
Claudia, it was never my intention...

19:38.310 --> 19:39.576
What, to take him away from me?

19:39.578 --> 19:41.144
How can you say that?

19:41.146 --> 19:42.479
You almost did.

19:42.481 --> 19:44.281
He told me he was leaving me,

19:44.283 --> 19:45.749
and now I know it was for you.

19:45.751 --> 19:46.850
When did he say that?

19:46.852 --> 19:48.118
You have everything.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.085
I have nothing.

19:49.087 --> 19:50.253
I don't have a husband...

19:50.255 --> 19:51.454
Okay, Claudia,
I know you're emotional...

19:51.456 --> 19:53.156
Wasn't it enough that
you had all of this?

19:53.158 --> 19:54.958
You had to have Matthew, too?

19:54.960 --> 19:56.393
- I'm sorry...
- Just get out...

19:57.462 --> 19:59.496
Just get out now!

20:10.905 --> 20:14.045
Maybe you were right and Claudia
shouldn't be staying with us.

20:14.047 --> 20:17.148
I mean, clearly, she needs
more help than we can give her.

20:17.150 --> 20:19.184
Go ahead and say, "I told you so."

20:19.206 --> 20:21.406
Actually,
after seeing Claudia this afternoon

20:21.408 --> 20:22.574
when she was with Sam,

20:22.576 --> 20:24.108
I think your initial instinct was right.

20:24.110 --> 20:25.210
I think she needs more than a caregiver.

20:25.212 --> 20:27.111
She needs connection.

20:27.113 --> 20:28.746
You didn't see what she just did.

20:28.748 --> 20:32.584
No, but to be fair,
you did mention Matthew.

20:32.586 --> 20:34.018
I'm guessing she didn't need a reminder

20:34.020 --> 20:35.453
that you were sleeping
with her dead husband.

20:35.455 --> 20:36.855
I didn't mean to upset her.

20:36.857 --> 20:39.891
Considering her fragility,
physical and emotional...

20:39.893 --> 20:43.695
Wow. I can't believe you're the
one spouting emotional truths.

20:43.697 --> 20:44.762
Neither can I.

20:44.764 --> 20:45.830
Look at you.

20:45.832 --> 20:47.232
You got me talking
empathy and compassion

20:47.234 --> 20:49.067
and Claudia staying here.

20:50.904 --> 20:53.938
Stop rubbing off on me.

21:06.894 --> 21:08.586
Rudy wins the match.

21:09.756 --> 21:12.757
- Great fight, Rudy. How are you feeling?
- Hungry.

21:12.759 --> 21:14.259
A little bird told me

21:14.261 --> 21:15.793
that the winner buys
pizza for the loser.

21:15.795 --> 21:18.062
Do you mind if we break with
tradition this time and I buy?

21:18.064 --> 21:20.932
- Sounds good to me.
- All right.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.347
Stansfield?

21:47.961 --> 21:51.162
Every major player under 40 in energy

21:51.164 --> 21:52.497
is in this room right now.

21:52.499 --> 21:54.299
Table is certainly set.

21:54.301 --> 21:56.801
You even manned up and
got me my tech twins.

21:57.756 --> 22:00.071
They look like they
could use an apology.

22:00.073 --> 22:01.205
Oh, I wouldn't wait for that.

22:01.207 --> 22:04.275
It would be rude not to
greet the guests first.

22:05.812 --> 22:06.811
Hello.

22:06.813 --> 22:08.246
Hello, everybody.

22:08.248 --> 22:10.381
Welcome.
Now, I would like to be the first

22:10.383 --> 22:12.317
to welcome you to Jeff Colby's house.

22:15.121 --> 22:17.121
I have a very important
announcement to make.

22:17.123 --> 22:19.524
Jeff and I are having a baby.

22:19.526 --> 22:21.125
Well, technically, we already did.

22:21.127 --> 22:22.961
The Morell Green Energy Corporation.

22:22.963 --> 22:24.829
And while it's not a literal baby,

22:24.831 --> 22:27.599
this new venture means
just as much to me.

22:27.601 --> 22:30.234
I am proud as hell to
introduce you to my new family,

22:30.236 --> 22:32.103
starting with my brilliant partner,

22:32.105 --> 22:34.772
a man who trusted me with his money,
with his brand,

22:34.774 --> 22:38.543
the only man I would trust with my baby,
Jeff Colby.

22:38.545 --> 22:39.978
Come on up here.

22:44.050 --> 22:46.618
Now, let's make one thing clear.

22:46.620 --> 22:48.953
This is not your daddy's energy company.

22:49.298 --> 22:50.955
We're fueled by life.

22:50.957 --> 22:53.057
Water, wind, sun,

22:53.059 --> 22:55.393
the natural,
unfiltered elements of this planet,

22:55.395 --> 22:57.929
and we will use those elements to power

22:57.931 --> 22:59.764
your very futures if you let us.

22:59.766 --> 23:01.633
The next generation.

23:01.635 --> 23:03.234
At Morell Corp.
we're all about new energy,

23:03.236 --> 23:05.403
and that's our theme for today.

23:05.405 --> 23:07.271
So let's get this party charged up.

23:14.147 --> 23:17.081
Smashing a crystal vase?

23:17.083 --> 23:18.783
No confusing the message there.

23:18.785 --> 23:20.218
Obviously, there's still some friction

23:20.220 --> 23:21.686
between the missus and the mistress,

23:21.688 --> 23:24.255
and maybe I can smooth things over.

23:24.257 --> 23:25.990
I'm quite a gracious host.

23:25.992 --> 23:27.759
Oh, I know. I saw the receipts.

23:27.761 --> 23:29.527
Hey, forgiveness ain't cheap,

23:29.529 --> 23:30.762
and you're lucky that's all it cost.

23:30.764 --> 23:33.698
Just how did you max out
an unmaxable credit card?

23:33.700 --> 23:35.166
Oh, we can find out again tomorrow

23:35.168 --> 23:37.135
if you want me to keep
playing nice with crazy.

23:37.137 --> 23:40.271
No, Bo! Stop! No!

23:40.273 --> 23:42.473
Bo, stop!

23:42.475 --> 23:44.242
I accidentally dropped my pills
and Bo started eating them

23:44.244 --> 23:45.777
- before I could pick them up.
- Oh, my God.

23:45.779 --> 23:47.478
Who knows what those
pills will do to him.

23:47.480 --> 23:49.080
- Okay, Sam, help me take Bo to the car.
- Yeah, let's go, Bo.

23:49.082 --> 23:50.648
What on earth happened?

23:50.650 --> 23:53.584
Take Claudia upstairs.
We're taking Bo to the vet.

23:59.325 --> 24:02.326
So, you're telling me you're
not upset that Kori showed up?

24:02.328 --> 24:04.896
That she rode in on that stallion

24:04.898 --> 24:07.465
that you are not having sex with?

24:07.467 --> 24:08.599
I'm fine they're here.

24:08.601 --> 24:10.735
- I didn't even notice them coming in.
- Mm-hmm.

24:10.737 --> 24:12.437
- Just drop it, okay?
- Okay.

24:12.439 --> 24:14.772
This house is freaking amazing, Jeff.

24:14.774 --> 24:16.274
That's an original, right?

24:16.276 --> 24:18.042
Better be for what I paid for it.

24:18.044 --> 24:20.978
I'm more of an abstract
expressionism man myself,

24:20.980 --> 24:22.880
but even I like that.

24:22.882 --> 24:24.382
Then you've got good taste.

24:24.384 --> 24:26.017
Of course bae's got good taste.

24:26.019 --> 24:27.785
He's with me.

24:30.857 --> 24:33.624
Fall, you might want to slow down.

24:33.626 --> 24:35.993
Not unless I speed up
on something stronger.

24:35.995 --> 24:37.295
Do you want anything from the bar?

24:37.297 --> 24:39.664
No, I'm good.

24:39.666 --> 24:41.566
- Hey, Fallon.
- Hello.

24:46.406 --> 24:48.473
Oh, you made it.

24:48.475 --> 24:50.408
Yup, and we brought
a bottle to celebrate.

24:50.410 --> 24:53.277
Our stock's over ten dollars a share.

24:53.279 --> 24:55.246
You said we'd never get over $6.50

24:55.248 --> 24:57.315
without Carrington Atlantic behind us.

24:57.317 --> 24:59.117
Yeah, I remember what I said,
Webb or Davis

24:59.119 --> 25:00.451
or whichever one of you is which.

25:00.453 --> 25:02.887
But I don't have time to
reminisce about the past.

25:02.889 --> 25:05.056
Today is about the future.

25:07.503 --> 25:09.360
There you go.

25:11.056 --> 25:12.263
Hi.

25:12.265 --> 25:13.972
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:13.973 --> 25:14.973
Your nose looks great.

25:27.013 --> 25:28.412
Nice party, Fallon.

25:28.414 --> 25:30.214
Surprised I got an invite.

25:30.216 --> 25:31.382
And I'm surprised you brought a date.

25:31.384 --> 25:32.383
Cling much?

25:32.385 --> 25:33.384
Obsess much?

25:33.386 --> 25:34.852
Or could you just feel the vibe?

25:34.854 --> 25:37.088
Oh, I'm not super concerned
about your relationship.

25:37.090 --> 25:38.222
But since you asked,

25:38.224 --> 25:40.158
Michael is taking me
on a little vacation.

25:40.160 --> 25:42.460
Said it would be nice to
get away from his boss.

25:42.462 --> 25:44.128
We're going to Miami this weekend.

25:44.130 --> 25:45.696
Well, if you last that long.

25:45.698 --> 25:46.964
Don't be bitter.

25:46.966 --> 25:48.166
You must have known your...

25:48.168 --> 25:51.102
chauffeur-with-benefits
situation had no future.

25:51.104 --> 25:52.403
And you think this is true love?

25:52.405 --> 25:54.839
I doubt he'd recognize you
if you weren't on all fours.

25:54.841 --> 25:58.009
Look who's talking,
Little Miss Thot-A-Lot.

25:58.011 --> 26:00.044
Did you ever think that you
never went out in public

26:00.046 --> 26:03.314
with Michael because he didn't
want to be seen with you?

26:04.046 --> 26:05.883
You know, normally,
I like to get the last word,

26:05.885 --> 26:08.553
but tonight's not about personal
baggage... it's about business.

26:08.555 --> 26:10.188
And I hope that,
despite all of this, you and I

26:10.190 --> 26:11.856
can still do business in the future.

26:11.858 --> 26:13.457
Excuse me.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.034
No need to put that away just yet.

26:23.036 --> 26:24.936
What are you doing in here?

26:24.938 --> 26:26.337
I could ask you the same question.

26:26.339 --> 26:28.372
I didn't think you had it
in you to be this petty,

26:28.374 --> 26:29.774
coming to my launch party with Kori.

26:29.776 --> 26:31.542
But you did a great job
of making me jealous.

26:31.544 --> 26:32.844
I'm on a date with my girlfriend.

26:32.846 --> 26:34.111
This has nothing to do with you.

26:34.113 --> 26:36.113
No, you did this
to get a rise out of me.

26:36.115 --> 26:37.481
Now I'm gonna get a rise out of you.

26:37.483 --> 26:39.483
Fallon, stop.

26:39.485 --> 26:40.885
You're being ridiculous, all right?

26:40.887 --> 26:42.653
Sex isn't gonna get you out of this one.

26:42.655 --> 26:43.654
Well, your mouth says no,

26:43.656 --> 26:45.189
but your friend seems pretty interested.

26:45.191 --> 26:47.525
You may not have any
respect for yourself,

26:47.527 --> 26:49.594
but I've got respect
for me and for Kori.

26:49.596 --> 26:52.063
So whatever you came here to do,
get it through your head...

26:52.065 --> 26:53.998
it's not happening.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.100
You never asked me to
go to Miami with you.

26:56.102 --> 26:58.436
You never introduced me to
Blake as your boyfriend.

26:58.438 --> 26:59.871
Because he'd fire you.

26:59.873 --> 27:02.139
Maybe I'd get another job.

27:03.869 --> 27:05.977
Don't pretend you care now, Fallon.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.679
You didn't catch feelings overnight.

27:08.681 --> 27:11.616
You seriously think I never cared?

28:01.450 --> 28:03.718
What the hell were you doing
in the bathroom with Fallon?

28:03.720 --> 28:04.686
- Nothing.
- If that was an act,

28:04.688 --> 28:06.888
that was the most convincing faux-job

28:06.890 --> 28:08.356
- I've ever seen.
- Kori, please...

28:08.358 --> 28:11.192
Obviously, you two are used
to playing games, and I'm not.

28:11.695 --> 28:12.727
And I won't.

28:12.729 --> 28:13.861
I know.

28:14.784 --> 28:16.898
Things are moving fast between us,

28:16.900 --> 28:18.633
but I know who you are.

28:18.635 --> 28:20.802
And I know that I'm
lucky to be with you.

28:21.594 --> 28:23.504
There's no way that I'd throw
that away for two minutes

28:23.506 --> 28:25.807
in a bathroom with Fallon Carrington.

28:25.809 --> 28:27.942
She was just putting on a show.

28:34.818 --> 28:36.217
Let's get out of here.

28:36.962 --> 28:37.885
I want to show you

28:37.887 --> 28:39.454
how much trouble you can get into

28:39.456 --> 28:42.590
in <i> my</i> bathroom.

28:50.428 --> 28:52.200
Our nerds are looking lonely.

28:59.100 --> 29:00.875
You boys ready for that drink?

29:18.453 --> 29:21.596
I see someone's unwinding from
a rough day at the office.

29:21.598 --> 29:23.164
Mm.

29:23.805 --> 29:24.999
I told you,

29:25.001 --> 29:27.769
COO and babysitting would
be difficult to juggle.

29:28.498 --> 29:30.371
But you handled yourself impeccably.

29:31.264 --> 29:33.174
Everything you've done for Claudia.

29:33.176 --> 29:34.776
You really are Wonder Woman.

29:46.235 --> 29:47.922
Claudia. What are you doing?

29:47.924 --> 29:49.791
Why are you in my bathtub?

29:49.793 --> 29:51.025
I don't know.

29:51.027 --> 29:52.760
I'm so sorry.

29:52.762 --> 29:53.761
I'm so embarrassed.

29:53.763 --> 29:55.163
I don't remember getting in here.

29:56.166 --> 29:57.632
Please don't be mad at me.

29:57.634 --> 29:59.600
I'm not mad, I'm just surprised.
Why didn't you say something?

29:59.602 --> 30:01.702
I don't know.

30:08.478 --> 30:12.013
Thank you. You're so kind.

30:15.692 --> 30:18.286
Cristal's so lucky.

30:23.543 --> 30:24.689
Blake?

30:26.386 --> 30:30.031
Blake? What the hell's going on?

30:36.237 --> 30:39.106
For you finally giving
us the time of day.

30:39.108 --> 30:40.842
Not that one shot's gonna rebuild

30:40.844 --> 30:42.243
the bridge you burned at Staplehouse.

30:42.245 --> 30:43.945
Oh, men and their emotions.

30:43.947 --> 30:46.380
All I want to know is
what do I have to do

30:46.382 --> 30:47.849
to get you guys to say yes

30:47.851 --> 30:50.151
to sharing your tech with Morell Corp.?

30:52.397 --> 30:53.855
Ugh, that's vile.

30:53.857 --> 30:55.890
Maybe it would taste better
with some nerd sauce.

30:57.393 --> 30:58.793
This is where you apologize.

30:58.795 --> 31:00.595
Oh, well, that's not gonna happen.

31:00.597 --> 31:03.498
You guys are like the
Kanyes of Silicon Valley.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.399
You're great at tech, everything else,

31:05.401 --> 31:06.400
not so much.

31:06.402 --> 31:07.401
I mean, marketing,

31:07.403 --> 31:08.903
you didn't pivot when the company did.

31:08.905 --> 31:10.867
Design, clumsy at best.

31:10.974 --> 31:13.908
PR, you're too busy focusing
on that hunk of metal,

31:13.910 --> 31:16.944
not your sweet, adorable faces.

31:16.946 --> 31:18.913
You get all that straight,
you might actually be able

31:18.915 --> 31:20.081
to make some real money.

31:20.083 --> 31:22.219
Okay, I think we've had enough.

31:22.254 --> 31:23.818
No, no, no, no, no.
If they've had enough,

31:23.820 --> 31:25.219
we're just getting started.

31:25.221 --> 31:26.387
Okay, let's go.

31:32.195 --> 31:35.329
- How did it even happen, Blake?
- I thought it was you.

31:35.331 --> 31:36.364
Well, it wasn't.

31:36.366 --> 31:37.832
While you were making out with Claudia,

31:37.834 --> 31:39.066
I was getting her crazy pills

31:39.068 --> 31:40.835
pumped out of your bloodhound's stomach.

31:40.837 --> 31:42.937
Come on, Cristal,
even I'm not stupid enough

31:42.939 --> 31:44.639
to sleep with a houseguest
when my wife could

31:44.641 --> 31:47.975
walk in at any minute... or ever.

31:47.977 --> 31:50.778
You were right.
And I was right the first time,

31:50.780 --> 31:52.280
before I got swept up in emotion.

31:52.282 --> 31:53.814
And I will never let that happen again.

31:53.816 --> 31:55.583
This woman is unhinged,

31:55.585 --> 31:57.852
and she keeps proving it more every day.

31:57.854 --> 32:00.057
Look, the fact is, she needs more help

32:00.092 --> 32:02.590
than we can provide.

32:02.592 --> 32:04.592
And I'm sorry, but we just can't protect

32:04.594 --> 32:07.495
every broken bird that
lands on our windowsill.

32:07.497 --> 32:11.399
She's not a bird, she's a woman...

32:11.401 --> 32:15.202
whose life I've ruined.

32:15.204 --> 32:16.837
She is sick,

32:16.839 --> 32:18.172
and she needs to be somewhere

32:18.174 --> 32:20.508
where there's 24-hour medical care

32:20.510 --> 32:22.209
provided by a professional,

32:22.211 --> 32:24.011
not her dead husband's ex-mistress.

32:25.412 --> 32:26.981
I just wanted to help.

32:26.983 --> 32:29.584
But are you sure this crusade
to help Claudia and her baby

32:29.586 --> 32:31.919
doesn't have more to do with
your feelings for Matthew?

32:33.656 --> 32:36.624
A part of Matthew is gonna
live on in this child.

32:36.626 --> 32:38.693
The child the two of you never had.

32:38.695 --> 32:40.294
Blake...

32:40.296 --> 32:42.463
I'm sure at some point
you thought about it.

32:42.465 --> 32:44.332
And that's okay.

32:44.334 --> 32:46.867
But it's not okay...

32:46.869 --> 32:49.937
for you to keep this woman in our lives

32:49.939 --> 32:52.540
because you're clinging to memories.

32:54.475 --> 32:56.978
I'll tell her it's time to move on.

32:58.147 --> 33:00.881
It's the best thing for all of us.

33:10.493 --> 33:11.659
Drink this.

33:12.810 --> 33:14.228
Slowly.

33:16.299 --> 33:18.032
This is water, it's not vodka.

33:18.839 --> 33:20.234
I know.

33:25.833 --> 33:27.141
Put this on.

33:31.614 --> 33:32.984
Oh...

33:34.450 --> 33:36.450
you think you're slick.

33:36.452 --> 33:38.886
You finally got a chance to seduce me.

33:41.090 --> 33:43.024
Hey...

33:43.026 --> 33:45.026
where'd you get these bugles?

33:45.028 --> 33:47.595
I mean bulges.

33:52.235 --> 33:54.235
Fallon, no.

33:54.237 --> 33:55.770
You're drunk.

33:55.772 --> 33:57.271
So?

33:59.042 --> 34:01.242
Okay, fine.

34:01.244 --> 34:04.845
Fine. Just leave me here
like everyone else.

34:04.847 --> 34:07.848
Just walk away, like my dad,

34:07.850 --> 34:11.152
like my stupid mom, like Culhane.

34:12.721 --> 34:14.054
What ever happened to Fallon

34:14.056 --> 34:18.426
"I exist only for me" Carrington?

34:18.428 --> 34:20.661
Is that what people think?

34:20.663 --> 34:23.063
Am I really that unlovable?

34:23.065 --> 34:24.364
Of course not.

34:24.367 --> 34:27.168
But then why does everyone
always abandon me?

34:28.248 --> 34:29.536
I'm still here.

34:47.754 --> 34:52.001
Sorry I've been avoiding you.

34:52.003 --> 34:53.772
I just don't know what to say anymore.

34:53.813 --> 34:55.880
No, I-I'm the one who's sorry.

34:55.882 --> 34:58.650
I should have said something
the second that Blake came in.

34:58.652 --> 34:59.717
I didn't realize...

34:59.719 --> 35:02.250
- No need to discuss it.
- Just know that

35:02.285 --> 35:04.355
everything you're doing is appreciated.

35:04.357 --> 35:05.723
And I know it is no excuse

35:05.725 --> 35:07.025
for what happened last night,

35:07.027 --> 35:09.394
but part of having
traumatic brain injury,

35:09.396 --> 35:12.597
it's not just confusion,
but loss of inhibition

35:12.599 --> 35:13.865
and impulse control.

35:13.867 --> 35:16.134
I just want what's best for you,
Claudia.

35:16.136 --> 35:18.336
And at this point I think
the best thing for you

35:18.338 --> 35:21.105
is not staying here at
the Carrington Manor

35:21.107 --> 35:25.410
but living someplace where they
can fully take care of you.

35:25.412 --> 35:27.245
You want me to leave?

35:28.813 --> 35:29.936
No, no, I can't.

35:29.971 --> 35:31.487
I'm afraid to be alone.

35:31.522 --> 35:33.785
I'm afraid that my
condition is getting worse.

35:33.787 --> 35:35.086
I'm bringing a baby into this world.

35:35.088 --> 35:37.088
A baby I-I don't feel
capable of raising.

35:37.090 --> 35:39.357
But you will have
nurses and your family.

35:39.359 --> 35:42.026
And I know you will love this baby.

35:42.028 --> 35:44.329
Finding the love isn't the question.

35:44.331 --> 35:46.898
I mean, it never is for women, right?

35:46.900 --> 35:48.233
We give and we give

35:48.235 --> 35:51.202
and we give un-until it breaks us.

35:51.204 --> 35:54.072
I don't want all that
giving to break me.

35:54.074 --> 35:56.808
You're stronger than you know, Claudia.
We all are.

35:56.810 --> 35:57.976
What if I'm not?

35:58.463 --> 36:00.812
This is an amazing life that you have,

36:00.814 --> 36:03.748
one that I could never
provide for my child.

36:03.750 --> 36:05.917
And I know it is a huge ask,

36:05.919 --> 36:08.853
and I probably sound
super crazy right now,

36:08.855 --> 36:12.257
but would you consider
raising this baby with me?

36:20.651 --> 36:21.399
Hey, we don't have any fights

36:21.401 --> 36:23.635
on the schedule today,
so you back for some lessons?

36:23.637 --> 36:24.869
Not exactly.

36:24.871 --> 36:26.905
I'm actually interested in
one of your other donors.

36:26.907 --> 36:29.073
- Yeah, which one?
- Chief Stansfield?

36:29.075 --> 36:30.508
I saw his photo on the wall over there.

36:30.510 --> 36:32.143
Chief Aaron? He's the best.

36:32.145 --> 36:33.878
He's on the board,
treasurer the last couple of years.

36:33.880 --> 36:35.280
Donates so much of his time.

36:35.282 --> 36:36.648
He's a really great guy.

36:36.650 --> 36:38.483
He's the one who got Blake
involved in the first place.

36:38.485 --> 36:41.185
Convinced your dad to give
the club $250K per year.

36:42.306 --> 36:43.364
I thought it was a million.

36:44.197 --> 36:45.913
Well, I guess it's all incremental

36:45.948 --> 36:46.691
when you're a billionaire,

36:46.693 --> 36:48.293
but I can't imagine what
we'd do with a million bucks.

36:48.295 --> 36:50.154
I'd probably take a vacation.

36:51.031 --> 36:53.197
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, come on, fellas, break it up.

36:53.199 --> 36:55.934
Come on, bring it in.

36:58.668 --> 37:00.000
Hey, it's Steven.

37:00.002 --> 37:01.635
When you get into the office tomorrow,

37:01.637 --> 37:03.837
can you pull the books for last year?

37:03.839 --> 37:06.807
Yeah. There's just a couple
of numbers I want to check.

37:09.164 --> 37:11.030
I brought you a little something to, uh,

37:11.080 --> 37:12.722
speed up your recovery.

37:15.718 --> 37:18.485
You seem pretty chipper.

37:18.487 --> 37:20.020
Did we...?

37:20.022 --> 37:22.289
Oh, if we did, you'd remember.

37:23.753 --> 37:25.159
Well, I was pretty wasted.

37:25.161 --> 37:26.427
The last thing I remember

37:26.429 --> 37:28.623
was railing on those two douche-nerds.

37:28.658 --> 37:30.465
The liquor just wouldn't let me stop.

37:30.537 --> 37:32.837
I guess I can't blame you for
dissolving Morell Corp. now.

37:32.839 --> 37:35.373
Are you kidding?
Davis asked for an autograph,

37:35.375 --> 37:37.775
and Webb wanted to propose;
they love you.

37:37.777 --> 37:39.310
Really?

37:39.312 --> 37:41.579
But I thought I called them
"two geeky Puff Daddies".

37:41.581 --> 37:43.915
"Kanyes", but they loved your advice.

37:43.917 --> 37:46.384
Thought it would add so
much value to their company,

37:46.386 --> 37:49.253
they want to license
their battery tech to us

37:49.255 --> 37:50.655
for under market value.

37:50.657 --> 37:51.756
You brought it home.

37:51.758 --> 37:53.357
No. They were sold

37:53.359 --> 37:55.426
the minute they saw your
name on that invite.

37:55.428 --> 37:57.595
Your reputation is what
saved this company.

37:57.597 --> 37:59.697
It was all you.

37:59.699 --> 38:02.099
It was us.

38:02.101 --> 38:04.202
I mean, you are pretty lovable.

38:04.204 --> 38:06.938
And we're family now.

38:06.940 --> 38:08.506
I'm not gonna leave you.

38:08.508 --> 38:10.875
At least not until we
make my money back.

38:10.877 --> 38:13.444
Oh, by that time you'll love
me too much to let me go.

38:13.446 --> 38:15.079
By the way, you're, uh,
welcome to stay as long

38:15.081 --> 38:17.114
as you need to figure out
your living situation.

38:17.116 --> 38:19.517
It's not the Ritz,
but the place is so big,

38:19.519 --> 38:21.285
we can be on opposite wings

38:21.287 --> 38:23.654
and never even see each other.

38:23.656 --> 38:25.489
Unless we want to.

38:41.921 --> 38:43.908
Booty, bubbles and nothing else.

38:43.910 --> 38:45.643
Sounds more like <i>Single White Female</i>

38:45.645 --> 38:47.178
than <i> Hand That Rocks the Cradle.</i>

38:47.180 --> 38:50.481
And then she asked me to
raise Matthew's baby with her.

38:50.483 --> 38:51.882
I mean, how crazy is that?

38:51.884 --> 38:53.718
Well, tell me some part
of you didn't immediately

38:53.720 --> 38:55.119
start decorating a nursery.

38:55.121 --> 38:57.888
Oh, please.
I would need a serious brain injury

38:57.890 --> 39:00.191
to agree to that.
No, it is full steam ahead

39:00.193 --> 39:01.259
for her moving out.

39:01.261 --> 39:02.960
Hello.

39:04.003 --> 39:04.911
Vet.

39:04.946 --> 39:08.232
- Yeah.
- Well, I hope it's good news.

39:08.234 --> 39:10.268
You seem okay to me.

39:11.362 --> 39:12.303
Are you sure?

39:13.935 --> 39:15.873
Okay, thanks.

39:15.875 --> 39:18.209
So he said that the medicine Bo ate

39:18.211 --> 39:20.244
won't cause any long-term side effects.

39:20.246 --> 39:21.746
Oh, thank God.

39:21.748 --> 39:23.848
But they ran some tests,
and Claudia's pills aren't right.

39:23.850 --> 39:25.016
What do you mean?

39:25.018 --> 39:26.250
I mean, that the label on the bottle

39:26.252 --> 39:27.585
doesn't match the pills.

39:27.587 --> 39:30.855
She's supposed to be taking
phen-a-something, he said,

39:30.857 --> 39:32.790
but she's actually just
been taking benzos.

39:32.792 --> 39:35.459
So did the doctor screw
up or the pharmacist?

39:38.261 --> 39:40.231
Or it wasn't a screwup at all.

39:41.017 --> 39:41.899
Maybe I was wrong,

39:41.901 --> 39:44.502
and this isn't a
'90s stalker-girl thriller.

39:44.504 --> 39:46.237
Maybe it's more Hitchcock.

39:47.193 --> 39:48.773
What if someone switched the pills?

39:48.775 --> 39:50.675
Someone who? And why?

39:50.677 --> 39:53.411
Someone who wanted to make
sure Claudia didn't get better.

39:53.413 --> 39:56.514
Th-The pills are supposed to
help her think clearly, right?

39:56.516 --> 39:57.882
Help her memory?

39:59.381 --> 40:01.786
So maybe there's something
they'd rather she forget.
