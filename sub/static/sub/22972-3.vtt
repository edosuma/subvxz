00:25.130 --> 00:27.710
Long week?

00:28.960 --> 00:32.920
Mm. Tell me about it.

00:32.970 --> 00:36.890
I work at the lamprey hatchery,
over on Slavyanska?

00:36.930 --> 00:39.060
Last night, I bring snack,

00:39.100 --> 00:43.940
but I trip and drop
into tank of broodstock.

00:43.980 --> 00:49.400
So, I go all night
on empty stomach.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.230
Like a Turk!

00:53.240 --> 00:58.070

01:13.920 --> 01:19.180
I was visited by a
time-traveling version of myself

01:19.220 --> 01:23.100
from the future.

01:23.140 --> 01:26.230
He told me he liked Looper

01:26.270 --> 01:29.560
better than Timecop,

01:29.610 --> 01:34.610
even though Timecop
is my favorite movie.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.450
And then, he sprained my neck,

01:41.490 --> 01:43.910
blew up the building...

01:47.500 --> 01:49.920
...and killed all my friends.

01:56.590 --> 02:00.180
I'm sorry about your shoelace.

02:42.850 --> 02:44.890
You must be Filip.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.580
And his nose.

03:03.620 --> 03:04.990
Like yours?

03:06.660 --> 03:10.500
M-Much, much larger and flatter.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.170
Erase the beard.

03:16.210 --> 03:19.010
And, uh, erase the moustache.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.110
So.

03:34.150 --> 03:36.780
It was Jean-Claude Van Damme.

03:36.820 --> 03:38.650
Jean-Claude Van Damme?

03:38.690 --> 03:39.820
You know of him?

03:48.160 --> 03:53.210
Why would the greatest actor
of all time kill all my friends?

03:53.250 --> 03:56.090
That's not the question
you should be asking.

03:56.130 --> 03:59.010
The question
you should be asking is:

03:59.050 --> 04:02.720
do you want to
do something about it?

04:05.050 --> 04:07.850
What do you want me to do?

04:54.310 --> 04:59.070
So I'm meeting a climatologist
from the university tonight.

04:59.110 --> 05:00.980
The important thing now
is to figure out

05:01.030 --> 05:03.240
how someone could amplify
the core functions of the chip

05:03.280 --> 05:05.740
to control weather
on a large scale.

05:05.780 --> 05:08.120
No, no, no.
The important thing now

05:08.160 --> 05:10.700
is that I was totally right
about the microchip.

05:10.740 --> 05:12.200
Right?

05:12.250 --> 05:14.580
Okay.
I mean, I'm pretty sure

05:14.620 --> 05:17.250
you just picked it up
off the floor.

05:17.290 --> 05:20.130
I mean, I'm the one who reverse-
engineered a baseline amplifier

05:20.170 --> 05:22.090
to see how it actually works.

05:22.130 --> 05:25.090
I did not just pick it up
off the floor.

05:25.130 --> 05:27.800
- Huh.
- I put it in my pocket,

05:27.840 --> 05:29.510
and carried it back
to the hotel.

05:29.550 --> 05:31.970
Oh, right.

05:32.020 --> 05:35.560
Maybe I'm not as, uh, washed up
as you thought, huh?

05:37.440 --> 05:39.310
Maybe.

05:39.360 --> 05:42.690
Or maybe you just got lucky.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.360
Maybe.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.700
Come on.

05:47.740 --> 05:50.370
They need you on the set.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.840
The soldiers are gone, Jim.

06:02.880 --> 06:06.130
The disguise worked.

06:06.170 --> 06:09.890
Ah, very smart, Huck.

06:09.930 --> 06:11.510
Who the fuck are you?

06:11.550 --> 06:13.100
- Where's Victor?
- Cut!

06:13.140 --> 06:14.350
- Who is this?
- Cut!

06:14.390 --> 06:15.810
Is that the one?

06:15.850 --> 06:17.496
No, why the fuck
would that be the one? Jesus.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.730
No. Okay, uh, hi.

06:19.770 --> 06:22.110
This is what I was talking about
with Dragan last night.

06:22.150 --> 06:24.530
You know, I brought up
your concerns. Uh...

06:24.570 --> 06:26.990
- Uh, pardon me.
- Get the fuck out of here.

06:27.030 --> 06:30.530
Uh... you know, it's...
he agreed with both of us

06:30.570 --> 06:34.990
that it is just straight fucked
and totally not woke at all

06:35.040 --> 06:37.660
to being calling a character
"N-word Jim," right?

06:37.710 --> 06:39.790
- Okay.
- And then we realized that...

06:39.830 --> 06:45.050
wow, I mean, like, having
a black guy play that character?

06:45.090 --> 06:47.510
It's just so fucked.

06:47.550 --> 06:50.640
I mean, no matter what
we name him.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.260
So we fired him.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.760
You fired Victor?

06:54.810 --> 06:58.730
Yeah, um, Dragan's got some,
some business partners in Asia

06:58.770 --> 07:00.730
that's he's trying... impress,

07:00.770 --> 07:02.980
so we decided
to Vin Diesel this shit,

07:03.020 --> 07:06.530
and toss some pork fried rice
up in this joint, shumai that!

07:06.570 --> 07:09.030
Triple our fuckin'
global box office.

07:09.070 --> 07:12.120
Boom! We get
Johnnie motherfucking Lao.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.160
Can you get the fuck
out of my face? Thanks.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.660
This dude is a fucking legend
in Thailand.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.330
I'm Chinese.

07:19.370 --> 07:21.500
Cool.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.170
Let's do this!

07:35.560 --> 07:37.196
- -The chip should
be in Van Damme's trailer.

07:37.220 --> 07:39.390
If anything goes wrong,

07:39.430 --> 07:41.980
call us.

07:42.020 --> 07:43.440
Huh.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.120
You two, let's find wardrobe
and blend in.

07:45.150 --> 07:46.900
Okay, boss.

07:52.110 --> 07:53.530
Thanks for the touch-up.

07:53.570 --> 07:54.780
You're really good.

07:56.200 --> 07:59.160
Even if this isn't
what you want to do.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.870
It's not that bad.

08:00.910 --> 08:04.630
Maybe you need to be
doing hair for someone else.

08:04.670 --> 08:08.130
Someone who actually
supports your dreams.

08:08.170 --> 08:09.260
Oh.

08:09.300 --> 08:12.760
- No, it's not...
- No?

08:12.800 --> 08:15.760
Since you started with him,
how much closer are you...

08:15.800 --> 08:17.850
to what you really want?

08:19.890 --> 08:21.890
Oh, honey.

08:21.940 --> 08:23.600
Do you think
I'm with Dragan

08:23.650 --> 08:24.810
because of his looks?

08:26.190 --> 08:28.270
I dream big.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.150
Just like you.

08:31.530 --> 08:35.030
Oh. Oh, baby, no! No.

08:35.070 --> 08:36.740
That's JC.

08:36.780 --> 08:39.830
He's your friend, Booboo.
He's a good boy.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.460
Baby, stop! Stop!

08:47.920 --> 08:51.670
Ever wonder what God thinks
about all this?

08:51.710 --> 08:54.260
Oh, I don't know, Huck, I'm...

08:54.300 --> 08:56.510
I'm Buddhist.

08:57.930 --> 08:59.010
Hey, you.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.470
- Cut!
- Come here.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.430
Fucking fucking fuck!

09:02.480 --> 09:04.480
What the fuck, people?!

09:04.520 --> 09:06.100
One single fucking take!

09:06.150 --> 09:08.310
One take! Hi, Krissy.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.126
- Oh.
- Is that your dog?

09:10.150 --> 09:12.530
- He is so cute. What a fucking
awesome dog that is. -Oh.

09:12.570 --> 09:14.900
Yes, she is!
Oh, did you get spooked, Booboo?

09:14.950 --> 09:16.990
Oh, baby, you never get spooked.

09:18.780 --> 09:22.160
JC, we're so sorry, we didn't
realize you were shooting.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.960
I thought I just saw you
walking back to your trailer.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.000
Let's take a break.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.170
I need to take a shower.

09:32.210 --> 09:35.340
I've got some ink on my finger.

09:35.380 --> 09:36.840
- Taking a break.
- Sorry.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.680
All right, everybody,
stay in the area.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.260
It's just a short break.

10:00.490 --> 10:01.530
Hey!

10:04.790 --> 10:08.830
- You?
- You?

10:08.880 --> 10:10.590
Just give me the chip, please.

10:10.630 --> 10:12.960
You think I would be
stupid enough

10:13.000 --> 10:14.710
to hide the chip in my trailer?

10:14.760 --> 10:16.590
Huh?

10:16.630 --> 10:18.760
We can do this the easy way...

10:18.800 --> 10:22.140
or the hard way.

10:26.560 --> 10:29.350
You killed all my friends,

10:29.400 --> 10:30.770
and...

10:30.810 --> 10:33.020
you thought that Looper

10:33.070 --> 10:34.900
was a better movie than Timecop.

10:37.320 --> 10:40.070
And...

10:40.110 --> 10:42.370
and now you want... to kill me.

10:44.790 --> 10:47.750
They told me...
not to trust your hero.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.090
Uh, hey, man...

10:53.130 --> 10:54.670
Hey! Don't touch me.

10:54.710 --> 10:58.260
It's fine.
I'm not actually a Timecop.

11:00.130 --> 11:02.800
Filip,
have you seen Van Damme?

11:02.850 --> 11:05.810
Wait. Wait.

11:08.310 --> 11:10.850
Let's talk about this.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.940
He's in the trailer.

11:20.530 --> 11:21.570
Uh, hello?

11:40.050 --> 11:41.050
We're compromised.

11:41.090 --> 11:43.140
There's probably more of them.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.180
Get this somewhere safe.

11:45.220 --> 11:46.720
Go.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.110
- RC Cola?
- Only RC.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.530
- RC Cola?
- That's right.

11:57.570 --> 12:00.650
This is all
you fucking have is RC Cola?

12:00.700 --> 12:02.200
- Huh?
- The fuck is this sh...

12:02.240 --> 12:03.660
- Hey, JC!
- Yes.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.540
JC, what are...
what are you doing here, buddy?

12:05.580 --> 12:08.200
Uh, you don't need to be here;
we're setting up for tomorrow.

12:33.770 --> 12:35.416
What scene is this?
What are we doing right now?

12:35.440 --> 12:36.666
- I'm not aware...
- What do you mean,

12:36.690 --> 12:38.360
- you don't fucking know?
- I don't...

12:43.200 --> 12:44.740
Fuck.

12:44.780 --> 12:46.120
That looks great.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.136
Fuck, are we rolling?
Are we rolling?

12:52.160 --> 12:53.160
Can we fucking roll?

12:56.500 --> 12:57.790
Roll!

12:57.840 --> 12:59.476
- Bitch, Jesus, come on!
- Needs to slate.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.840
Stunt team! In there!

13:01.880 --> 13:04.180
Confederates,
kick his motherfucking ass.

13:04.220 --> 13:06.590
Come on, man.
What the fuck are you doing?

13:06.640 --> 13:07.970
Get the fuck in there!

13:17.810 --> 13:18.860
Keep going!

13:32.120 --> 13:34.620
God, I am so fucking hard
right now.

13:54.230 --> 13:55.430
Fight back.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.280
"D" camera, get up on that
second deck and join that party.

14:21.340 --> 14:23.500
Easy on the shake.
I'm not Greengrass.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.230
Huh?

14:49.660 --> 14:51.660
Oh!

14:51.700 --> 14:54.450
Holy shit, yes!

14:54.490 --> 14:57.370
I did not know
we were set up for that.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.670
Fuck. Okay, I got to go
find a distraction

15:04.710 --> 15:05.920
for when this is over.

15:08.010 --> 15:10.300
Blend in and help
if he needs backup.

15:10.340 --> 15:13.010
I don't get involved.
You know that.

15:13.050 --> 15:15.140
You're already involved, kid.

15:38.790 --> 15:40.370
This gun is not in the script.

15:40.410 --> 15:42.750
And they don't have
automatic pistols in the 1830s.

15:42.790 --> 15:44.250
Shut up.
Nobody cares.

16:46.940 --> 16:50.110
And... cut!

16:50.150 --> 16:52.280
Fuck yes!

16:52.320 --> 16:53.860
Fuck yes, people.
Fuck yes.

16:53.900 --> 16:57.280
JC... I love you.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.330
I love you.

16:58.370 --> 17:00.950
I love you, too.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.410
Fuck yes!

17:02.460 --> 17:04.540
Up top.

17:04.579 --> 17:06.710
You're welcome.
You guys are welcome.

17:06.750 --> 17:08.089
Okay, that's lunch!

17:08.130 --> 17:09.130
Thank God.

17:09.170 --> 17:10.460
'Cause I'm fucking starving.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.220
These men are dead.

17:27.099 --> 17:31.730
Vanessa,
I want to tell you something.

17:31.780 --> 17:33.320
It's about Victor.

17:35.820 --> 17:38.780
I, uh... I got him fired.

17:38.820 --> 17:40.080
It's my fault.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.410
What?

17:43.450 --> 17:45.000
I mean, I didn't mean to.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.000
I told Gunnar
it's about his name.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.856
It's offensive, you know.
His name was offensive.

17:50.880 --> 17:54.050
And, uh, now his name
is Johnnie Lao.

17:54.090 --> 17:55.800
It's confusing.

17:55.840 --> 17:59.600
You told Gunnar that calling him
"N-word Jim" was offensive?

18:01.680 --> 18:03.140
Yeah.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.530
Look at us.

18:12.570 --> 18:15.490
Like a well-oiled machine.

18:15.530 --> 18:17.110
Like in the old days.

18:17.150 --> 18:18.200
Yeah.

18:21.580 --> 18:24.250
JC, why did you
stand me up in Bali?

18:33.800 --> 18:36.800
I lied to you...

18:36.840 --> 18:39.050
about the emu farm.

18:44.970 --> 18:47.480
It's not in Bali, is it?

18:47.520 --> 18:51.270
When you told me
you wanted to see it,

18:51.310 --> 18:54.020
I panicked.

18:54.070 --> 18:57.030
And I was not ready to show you

18:57.070 --> 18:59.860
where it really is.

18:59.910 --> 19:02.620
So you said it was in Bali?

19:02.660 --> 19:05.580
JC, that's a terrible lie.

19:05.620 --> 19:10.330
Everyone wants to go to Bali.

19:10.370 --> 19:12.670
Yeah, it backfired
pretty bad, huh?

19:12.710 --> 19:16.840
So...

19:16.880 --> 19:19.050
where is it really?

19:23.140 --> 19:24.850
Did you hear that?

19:34.020 --> 19:35.480
Filip!

19:35.520 --> 19:37.360
Don't shoot me.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.950
Don't shoot me, please.

19:39.990 --> 19:42.780
My boss is expecting me,
and if I don't show up,

19:42.820 --> 19:45.280
he will send more guys
to look...

19:45.330 --> 19:46.620
to look for me.

19:46.660 --> 19:48.200
Then I guess...

19:48.250 --> 19:50.500
I'd better show up.

19:52.210 --> 19:53.630
Yeah.

19:53.670 --> 19:56.920
Jane, I told you,
he's on a SpaceX flight.

19:56.960 --> 20:00.510
You tell Channing it's his ass
if he doesn't get back to me.

20:00.550 --> 20:02.470
Uh-huh.

20:02.510 --> 20:04.680
I'll call you back.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.720
Hello, friend.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.310
We need to talk.

20:13.940 --> 20:17.150
Director
authorization recognized.

20:17.190 --> 20:20.320
Security protocols engaged.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.330
Room secured.

20:26.370 --> 20:28.830
Okay.

20:28.870 --> 20:31.460
This is about Johnson.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.460
He killed three people.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.710
On camera.

20:34.750 --> 20:37.380
You could see it
in the fucking dailies.

20:37.420 --> 20:39.000
It's been handled.

20:39.050 --> 20:42.510
It never should have happened
in the first place.

20:42.550 --> 20:44.840
We all knew that
he was a wild card.

20:44.890 --> 20:47.930
You're the one who sold us
on this plan.

20:47.970 --> 20:50.890
And the plan is working.

20:50.930 --> 20:54.310
I need more than promises.

20:54.350 --> 20:57.190
I think we both understand
what the stakes are here.

20:59.190 --> 21:01.360
You're going to Bulgaria.

21:02.650 --> 21:05.910
Fine.

21:05.950 --> 21:08.330
But when I get back,

21:08.370 --> 21:11.450
you and I are gonna have
a little conversation

21:11.500 --> 21:15.580
about trust.

21:15.620 --> 21:18.340
Hello. Hello.

21:18.380 --> 21:20.590
It's just me, Filip.

21:20.630 --> 21:23.300
Beep, beep. Hey, boss.

21:38.270 --> 21:40.820
Hey. Oh.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.040
Boss?

21:53.080 --> 21:55.790
You want to see me?

21:55.830 --> 21:57.710
See me?

21:59.290 --> 22:03.300
I've always been obsessed
with the weather.

22:03.340 --> 22:07.010
My father gave me a snow globe
when I was a child.

22:07.050 --> 22:10.510
I used to love to peer
into its depths,

22:10.550 --> 22:13.890
and imagine what it was like
to summon up a storm

22:13.930 --> 22:15.770
with the snap...

22:15.810 --> 22:18.440
of a finger.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.310
And now I know.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.440
Or at least I will know

22:22.480 --> 22:27.110
when you give me back
my microchip, Mr. Van Damme.

22:32.370 --> 22:35.620
There must be some,
uh, confusion.

22:35.660 --> 22:37.370
My name is Filip.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.540
I don't know
what kind of twisted game

22:41.590 --> 22:43.630
you're playing, Van Damme.

22:43.670 --> 22:45.300
I bring you here
to make a movie.

22:45.340 --> 22:46.590
Instead,

22:46.630 --> 22:49.510
you blow up my factory
and kill my men.

22:49.550 --> 22:52.010
You know what they told me?

22:52.050 --> 22:55.640
"Hollywood stars
can be monsters.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.310
Don't employ them."

22:57.350 --> 22:59.230
Maybe I should have listened.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.320
This Van Damme,
I don't know who he is.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.190
Hmm.

23:05.230 --> 23:09.490
He seems to me like a
very handsome, intelligent man.

23:09.530 --> 23:12.160
But I don't know who he is.

23:13.830 --> 23:18.080
My men sent Filip
to impersonate you,

23:18.120 --> 23:20.920
so, of course,
he knows who you are.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.790
Plus, you look nothing like
the real Filip.

23:22.840 --> 23:24.550
- That's not...
- You...

23:24.590 --> 23:27.090
have something I want.

23:27.130 --> 23:28.380
But...

23:28.420 --> 23:31.680
I have something you want.

23:33.350 --> 23:34.810
Tomorrow night,

23:34.850 --> 23:36.140
we trade.

23:43.860 --> 23:45.440
Oh.

23:46.980 --> 23:51.820
A gala to celebrate
the impending success

23:51.860 --> 23:53.570
of our movie.

23:53.620 --> 23:55.870
Black tie, of course.

23:55.910 --> 23:58.250
Here at my humble abode.

23:58.290 --> 23:59.710
Hmm... mmm.

23:59.750 --> 24:04.080
It says that this Van Damme
will be here.

24:04.130 --> 24:06.550
Maybe we can arrange
a kidnapping.

24:06.590 --> 24:09.460
Just bring the chip!

24:11.550 --> 24:14.340
Or you'll never see...

24:14.390 --> 24:17.140
your little friend again.

24:20.890 --> 24:22.270
Alexei,

24:22.310 --> 24:24.150
play Luis' kidnapping video.

24:24.190 --> 24:25.520
Pardon?

24:29.360 --> 24:31.610
Alexei,
play Luis' kidnapping video.

24:31.650 --> 24:33.200
Pardon?

24:33.240 --> 24:37.280
Alexei,
play Luis' kidnapping video!

24:37.330 --> 24:39.790
Okay.

24:39.830 --> 24:42.160
Well...

24:54.130 --> 24:55.550
You really should

24:55.590 --> 24:58.810
keep better tabs on your people,
Mr. Van Damme.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.860
You son of a bitch.

25:21.830 --> 25:23.620
Just be there.

25:25.580 --> 25:26.830
Yeah.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.750
Oh, Jean-Claude, one more thing.

25:33.920 --> 25:35.156
You're crushing it in the movie.

25:35.180 --> 25:36.430
The dailies...

25:37.340 --> 25:39.300
they're amazing.

25:40.350 --> 25:41.680
