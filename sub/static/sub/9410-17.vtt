- Of course I did.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.200
That's where they hid all
our presents last Christmas.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.567
They must be down here someplace.

04:51.733 --> 04:53.533
Do you think anybody's in there?

"Vampire Breath"?
Some kind of joke.

Never trust a vampire.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.367
Do you know a way out of here?

If I did, I wouldn't
be trapped down here.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.933
Is there anybody in them?

11:41.933 --> 11:43.733
Not right now.

11:43.733 --> 11:46.100
The vampires are all still
hunting till sunrise.

11:46.100 --> 11:49.100
I sleep during the day,
like they do.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.633
At night, I'm supposed to clean
and polish their coffins.

11:51.633 --> 11:54.600
And if I don't,

11:54.600 --> 11:56.633
they'll turn me
into one of them.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.633
We won't let that happen,

We're all gonna get out
of here before sunrise.

12:01.133 --> 12:04.967
- And before Count Nightwing gets us.
- Count Nightwing?

12:04.967 --> 12:07.033
He's the most deadly vampire of all.

12:07.033 --> 12:09.033
Why is he after you?

12:09.033 --> 12:11.800
'Cause of his stupid little bottle

- [ Freddy ] Sure.

12:20.967 --> 12:24.233
- Where is it?
- I thought you had it.

12:24.233 --> 12:26.900
Maybe you lost it
when you came crashing down.

12:26.900 --> 12:29.400
We have to find it.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.400
We have to.

12:37.633 --> 12:40.633
What's the big deal
with Vampire Breath anyway?

12:40.633 --> 12:43.100
It's everything to them.

12:43.100 --> 12:46.400
It gives them their power,
their magic. It restores their memory.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.400
It keeps them immortal.

12:48.400 --> 12:51.400
While the vampires sleep
during the day,

12:51.400 --> 12:54.400
they stash their breath
in a little bottle.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.400
That way,
if anything happens to them,

12:56.900 --> 12:59.300
their vitality is stored
in a safe place.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.300
That must be why
he wants it back so bad.

13:02.300 --> 13:05.300
If he gets all charged up again,
he'll remember where he left his fangs.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.100

Of course she's a vampire.

A greedy little vampire who dares to
rob me of my breath, my very essence.

Just enough left to make me
even more powerful than you.

16:38.567 --> 16:41.067
At last.

16:53.733 --> 16:56.233
- [ Count Nightwing Laughing ]
- Hurry!

16:56.233 --> 16:57.767
Come on.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.200
I am renewed.

16:59.933 --> 17:03.367
I remember where my fangs are.

17:03.867 --> 17:06.267
And now, for you.

17:06.267 --> 17:08.933
You are starting to bug me.

17:10.267 --> 17:12.467
No!

17:19.666 --> 17:22.433
[ Laughing ]

17:25.700 --> 17:27.433
Keep running!
Don't look back!

17:30.433 --> 17:32.400
Move!

17:33.833 --> 17:35.867
- Come on.
- [ Laughing Continues ]

17:38.367 --> 17:40.333
You can never escape!

17:40.333 --> 17:42.767
[ Laughing ]

17:42.767 --> 17:45.133
- There is no hiding place for you.
- Go. Go!

17:45.700 --> 17:48.267
[ Laughing ]

17:48.267 --> 17:53.400
- This way!
- My fangs await me.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.833
Run! Run!

17:57.333 --> 17:59.867
- [ Gasps ]
- Freddy, get up. Please, get up.

18:01.233 --> 18:03.833
I'm okay.
Let's go! Let's go!

18:07.300 --> 18:10.733
- [ Gasps ]
- What in the world happened here?

18:10.733 --> 18:13.900
- The vampire-- He's after us!
- We need a wooden stake or garlic, quick!

18:13.900 --> 18:17.633
- What?
- [ Cara, Freddy Gasp ]

18:17.633 --> 18:20.100
See? We told you.

18:20.100 --> 18:25.833
- Daddy. Is that you?
- My baby girl!

18:28.400 --> 18:30.333
Oh!

18:30.333 --> 18:33.667
Pops, we thought we'd lost you.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.833
What's going on?

18:38.733 --> 18:41.600
Oh, don't be shy, kids.
Come give your Grandpa a big hug.

18:42.033 --> 18:44.600
Grandpa?
These two are yours?

18:44.600 --> 18:47.500
That was a close one,
wasn't it?

18:47.500 --> 18:50.700
- [ Chuckling ]
- But he's a vampire.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.800
Of course he is.
We all are.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.300
But if you guys are vampires,

18:55.300 --> 18:59.533
that means... we must be--

18:59.967 --> 19:01.667
[ Thunderclap ]

19:04.300 --> 19:07.233
Oh!

19:07.233 --> 19:12.133
[ Mom ] Oh. We don't initiate you into
the vampire life until you're teenagers.

19:13.633 --> 19:15.633
- Only a minute away.
- Ah.

19:19.333 --> 19:22.333
Oh. Right where I left them.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.533
[ Thunderclaps ]

19:29.533 --> 19:31.833
[ Laughing ]

19:33.333 --> 19:35.367
- Aah.
- Aah.

19:35.867 --> 19:37.867
Oh, don't worry.
They hurt a bit at first.

19:37.867 --> 19:40.367
But by the time
you've had your first meal,

19:40.367 --> 19:42.900
they'll be fine.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.733
Happy birthday!

19:45.433 --> 19:49.200
Now for your big surprise.
It's upstairs in your room.

19:51.833 --> 19:55.967
I'm not sure we can take
any more surprises.

20:16.300 --> 20:19.533
- Happy birthday, Cara.
- Yeah. Happy birthday.

20:24.700 --> 20:27.033
[ Freddy ]
I get the top coffin.

20:30.333 --> 20:33.267
- Good night.
- Good night.
