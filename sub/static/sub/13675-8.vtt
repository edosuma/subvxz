WOMAN: With your two spoons like this
you scoop, not too much,

00:11.596 --> 00:13.211
and put it on the guest's plate.

00:13.472 --> 00:16.009
From their right side,
holding the pan in your left,

00:16.100 --> 00:18.933
serving spoon's in your right like this.

00:19.687 --> 00:23.726
Making sure not to burn the guest,
warn them gently that the pan is hot.

00:23.816 --> 00:25.226
Do not drip sauce.

00:29.739 --> 00:32.355
DEREK: It's all right. Take your time.

00:32.450 --> 00:34.736
It's okay. Try it again.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.784
WAITRESS: This is hard.

00:47.131 --> 00:50.373
Let me show you
how a SAG member does it, all right?

00:50.468 --> 00:53.551
Scoop here. Place there.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.386
Wow, that's awesome.

00:56.474 --> 00:58.715
DEREK: Well, thank you. I played Victor,

00:58.809 --> 01:01.391
the homicidal banquet waiter
in Fright Night 7.

01:01.479 --> 01:04.095
-Really?
-No. Not really.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.476
Try it again. You got it?

01:06.776 --> 01:08.732
You're holding your spoons all wrong.

01:08.819 --> 01:11.777
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:12.657 --> 01:15.490
Thank God for Derek.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.113
You need to take a deep breath.

01:18.204 --> 01:19.660
We're not ready, Paul.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.908
That's why they call it a soft opening.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.284
-If it doesn't work...
-Okay, okay.

01:23.376 --> 01:26.334
...you take a pill
and try it again tomorrow night.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.376
-That's what this week is for.
-I get it.

MAN: Fuck!

01:29.632 --> 01:30.712
Son of a bitch.

01:32.510 --> 01:34.125
Uh, get me the first aid kit.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.343
Sorry, Chef. Rookie move.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.921
It's okay. It's okay. It happens to everybody.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.678
Okay, it's not serious,
but we're gonna take you off

01:41.769 --> 01:43.350
to the emergency room,
let them wrap it up right.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.137
-Thank you, Chef.
-Okay? Let's go.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.019
JANETTE: It's okay. It's not serious.

01:53.114 --> 01:55.856
Okay? Let's go.

01:55.992 --> 01:58.108
What the hell happened to him?

01:59.912 --> 02:01.618
Well, it happens.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.330
You don't think we're ready?

02:08.045 --> 02:10.502
We're ready. No worries.

03:55.653 --> 03:57.769
Sure you want to sell all this?

03:57.863 --> 03:59.319
Yeah, like you said, man,

03:59.407 --> 04:02.490
I'm in no danger of ever being like
no great musician.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.859
You ain't no fisherman, neither.

04:05.371 --> 04:07.703
l'll figure it out eventually.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.872
Damn, son. She's cute,

04:09.959 --> 04:12.541
but selling your instruments
and moving to Chalmette?

04:12.628 --> 04:16.246
-Are you serious?
-l'm tired of the drive.

04:16.340 --> 04:18.581
Next thing you know,
you'll be getting married.

04:18.676 --> 04:20.587
I didn't say anything about getting married.

04:20.678 --> 04:23.260
You might as well. Ha, you already there.

04:23.347 --> 04:25.838
(LAUGHS) You whipped, son.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.606
(PHONE RINGING)

04:42.116 --> 04:44.072
Hello?

04:44.160 --> 04:45.366
Yeah.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.444
Oh, wait a minute.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.449
Hold on a minute. Let me grab a pen.

04:55.045 --> 04:58.082
Okay. Okay.

04:59.884 --> 05:02.045
That's the trial date?

05:03.179 --> 05:05.170
Oh, that's the hearing.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.682
When is the trial?

05:09.768 --> 05:12.054
(INDISTINCT TALKING FROM PHONE)

05:13.647 --> 05:15.558
Thank you.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.606
You all right?

05:21.697 --> 05:23.653
Yeah.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.783
500 feels light to me.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.657
Yeah, well, I kept the Danelectro.

05:30.748 --> 05:34.036
Got to have something to do in Chalmette
besides going to Rocky and Carlo's.

05:34.126 --> 05:36.208
Huh, I hear that.

05:36.337 --> 05:39.329
Only so much mac and cheese
a Dutch motherfucker can eat.

05:39.423 --> 05:40.412
(CHUCKLES)

05:40.549 --> 05:42.631
All right. Be right back.

05:48.057 --> 05:49.763
(LAUGHS)

05:51.352 --> 05:54.515
Aren't you glad you discovered the Parkway?

05:54.772 --> 05:56.933
For an outsider, I do okay.

05:59.443 --> 06:01.934
So, this fella from Texas...

06:02.571 --> 06:05.404
We worked together in Houston, San Antonio,

06:05.491 --> 06:07.857
some other projects I had a piece of.

06:07.952 --> 06:09.442
Bobby has the know-how to get it done,

06:09.537 --> 06:11.823
and I know the people in DC
who need to know him.

06:12.623 --> 06:14.534
He gets the winning bid
in Washington from HUD,

06:14.625 --> 06:15.956
that gets this project jump-started.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.375
And, of course, he banks with you.

06:18.462 --> 06:20.293
Well, that would be real friendly of him.

06:20.464 --> 06:21.453
Hmm.

06:21.757 --> 06:24.123
You're talking about bringing home
some real bacon here.

06:24.426 --> 06:27.042
This? This is lagniappe.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.178
On St. Bernard alone,
I got all the landscaping.

06:30.266 --> 06:34.179
And, if they approve a community center,
I'm in line to sub some of that construction.

06:35.354 --> 06:37.470
lfl had known the fix was in
on public housing earlier,

06:37.565 --> 06:39.521
I'd have had half the damn projects.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.439
I believe you would.

06:41.986 --> 06:44.147
The game goes past New Orleans, boss.

06:44.238 --> 06:48.072
I know you guys like to think the sun rises
and sets on either end of St. Charles Avenue,

06:48.742 --> 06:51.825
but sometimes it pays to be
a citizen of the world.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.903
l underestimated you.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.831
You did.

06:58.419 --> 07:02.753
Now, this jazz center thing you got going...

07:03.299 --> 07:05.415
Let's talk about that.

07:05.509 --> 07:08.751
National Park Service is doing renovations
at the other end of Armstrong Park.

07:09.221 --> 07:10.802
And I know you need more money from FEMA

07:10.889 --> 07:13.175
to renovate the auditorium
than they're currently offering.

07:15.519 --> 07:18.306
Hey, I didn't go all the way
to Washington, DC,

07:18.397 --> 07:19.557
without making a friend or two.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.854
In or out? Which am |, boss?

07:41.045 --> 07:42.160
Sorry.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.996
Do you want me to make you some tea?

07:45.090 --> 07:47.172
No, thank you.

07:47.259 --> 07:49.341
Organic Earl Grey.

07:49.428 --> 07:52.295
(CHUCKLES) l... ljust really
need to get this done.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.845
We're starting the record in a few weeks.

07:53.932 --> 07:57.095
-Marvin's on my ass.
-Yeah, I totally understand.

07:57.186 --> 08:01.270
And I completely support
your incredible talent

08:01.357 --> 08:02.517
and work ethic.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.728
Thank you.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.854
Oh, sorry.

08:06.945 --> 08:09.436
On the subject of creative renewal.

08:09.531 --> 08:10.520
Dinner tonight...

08:10.616 --> 08:12.356
Janette's, uh, new restaurant.

08:12.451 --> 08:15.409
She's having, like, a dress rehearsal
and invited us.

08:15.496 --> 08:19.034
That's nice,
but I don't know when we'll finish.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.533
I told you about this.

08:24.296 --> 08:27.629
Sonny Landreth. His new record.
I'm guesting on a track.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.581
How'd that happen?

08:29.677 --> 08:33.420
That I told you and you don't remember?
It happens all the time.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.845
Wait, Sonny Landreth?

08:34.932 --> 08:36.513
He's not on your label.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.682
-Marvin knows him.
-Marvin.

08:38.769 --> 08:39.758
(SCOFFS)

08:44.775 --> 08:47.642
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.356
Sorry.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.569
Your Honor, the District Attorney's Office
takes offense

08:55.661 --> 09:00.200
at Miss Bernette's reasons for having sought
an emergency petition in the first place.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.417
There's no evidence whatsoever

09:02.501 --> 09:04.287
that these records
were going to be destroyed.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.790
TONl: My experience with the NOPD has been

09:07.256 --> 09:08.712
othenNise.

09:08.799 --> 09:12.633
And last week I got a call
from an anonymous tipster

09:12.720 --> 09:16.759
that indicated that the files might disappear
if I didn't act.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.881
An anonymous tipster, Toni?

09:18.976 --> 09:21.058
You don't believe me, Kerry?

09:23.147 --> 09:27.106
The fact remains, these are investigative files
in pending cases, Your Honor.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.602
What do you say to that, Miss Bernette?

09:28.694 --> 09:30.434
I am aware of the exception, Your Honor.

09:30.529 --> 09:33.236
And I am willing to bet that if you look

09:33.407 --> 09:36.695
at the investigative files
for Abreu and for Seals,

09:36.785 --> 09:39.367
you will find that a minimum
of police work was done

09:39.455 --> 09:41.036
in the days after the storm

09:41.123 --> 09:45.116
and even less in the weeks,
months, and years since,

09:45.419 --> 09:49.287
and that these are not
active and pending cases,

09:49.423 --> 09:53.132
but that they were quickly
and unceremoniously dumped

09:53.218 --> 09:55.425
by NOPD.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.889
Then why bother fighting for them?

09:59.558 --> 10:01.514
To prove a pattern.

10:01.602 --> 10:05.390
l have been gathering affidavits
from witnesses to a series of incidents

10:05.481 --> 10:08.268
involving the NOPD officer that I believe

10:08.358 --> 10:12.351
to be involved in both the Abreu
and the Seals shootings.

10:12.446 --> 10:16.485
And the department has failed
to investigate allegations

10:16.575 --> 10:20.159
against this officer,
either criminally or administratively.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.989
Mr. Clayton,

10:26.084 --> 10:28.291
if you can review the case files and show me

10:28.378 --> 10:31.165
where substantial police work has been done
in the last three years,

10:31.548 --> 10:33.288
I will rule in your favor.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.125
Othen/vise, I'm going to rule that these cases

10:36.220 --> 10:39.633
are indeed inactive
and Miss Bernette can review

10:39.723 --> 10:42.430
whatever police work did or did not occur.

10:43.477 --> 10:46.184
Okay, then. I am late for court.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.566
-Hey.
-LARRY: Hey.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.861

10:57.991 --> 11:00.152
Them boys must have gotten to it.

11:00.244 --> 11:03.077
That ADA called today to set the trial date.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.030
-End of April.
-Finally, huh?

11:06.124 --> 11:08.786
Some kind of preliminary thing this week.

11:09.211 --> 11:10.997
That's good.

11:13.382 --> 11:14.713
Larry.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.164
Uh-huh?

11:16.885 --> 11:20.628
Something happened
at the bar Lundi Gras night.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.429
There was this kid at the bar.
I'd never seen him before.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.018
Did he say anything?

11:29.356 --> 11:31.597
Just gave me that look, you know?

11:31.692 --> 11:33.057
Then he lit a match.

11:34.111 --> 11:35.772
He held it.

11:35.904 --> 11:38.065
I sent John over to talk to him, he took off.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.404
Why didn't you tell me?

11:40.492 --> 11:43.780
'Cause we were busy moving in here.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.032
'Cause it was Mardi Gras.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.619
'Cause I wasn't sure.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.541
So ljust put it out of my mind.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.038
Maybe you shouldn't go
back to the bar tonight.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.916
Can't John close up?

11:56.300 --> 11:57.289
Mmm.

11:58.093 --> 11:59.549
Fuck that.

12:01.930 --> 12:05.297
I'm not letting them tell me how to live.

12:05.392 --> 12:10.307
Look, you see that asshole again,
you call me immediately, okay?

12:11.607 --> 12:12.722
Okay.

See you again soon, Chef.

44:25.664 --> 44:27.404
Good night.

44:28.959 --> 44:31.041
-You know him?
-Mm-hmm.

44:31.127 --> 44:32.503
Waited on him at Stella.

44:32.587 --> 44:35.954
And, uh, Nola, too. Gets around.

44:36.049 --> 44:38.335
Good tipper.

44:38.426 --> 44:40.087
Good shoes, too. Cole Haans.

44:40.178 --> 44:41.759
-I like him.
-MAN: Hey, Derek.

44:43.431 --> 44:45.968
(LAUGHING)

44:46.059 --> 44:48.425
MAN: Chef.

44:49.062 --> 44:51.178
Hi, how have you been?

44:51.273 --> 44:52.513
Thank you so much for coming.

44:52.607 --> 44:55.019
Congratulations, Chef. It was splendid.

44:55.110 --> 44:58.352
-Thank you.
-You changed your mind, huh?

44:58.446 --> 45:00.937
Got to admit, I was a little hurt.

45:01.032 --> 45:02.613
And jealous.

45:02.701 --> 45:04.657
Oh, it was nothing personal.

45:04.744 --> 45:07.076
Timing maybe.

45:07.163 --> 45:10.530
I thought I wasn't homesick, but I was.

45:11.793 --> 45:13.909
-Good luck, Chef.
-Thank you.

45:18.300 --> 45:20.006
Welcome.

45:23.138 --> 45:25.424
-(DOGS BARKING)
-(MEN SHOUTING)

45:43.617 --> 45:45.323
What the fuck?

46:12.812 --> 46:14.973
Look over there.

46:15.065 --> 46:18.148
That's the motherfucker came into my bar.

46:18.234 --> 46:20.520
He was the one that threatened you?

46:20.612 --> 46:22.443
I think so.

46:26.910 --> 46:28.696
Yes.

46:28.787 --> 46:30.527
Oh, yes.

46:30.622 --> 46:31.611
Look at them.

46:32.499 --> 46:34.785
They're laughing about this.

46:35.251 --> 46:37.833
What did he say to you exactly?

46:37.921 --> 46:39.457
Nothing.

46:39.547 --> 46:42.630
He didn't say anything.

46:42.717 --> 46:44.969
He looked at me,

46:45.053 --> 46:47.465
lit a match.

46:48.765 --> 46:51.381
That's not enough to prove
intimidation, LaDonna.

47:00.235 --> 47:02.851
You gave him two casings from the shooting
at the lberville, right?

47:02.946 --> 47:05.403
Right. And in his memo he says

47:05.490 --> 47:10.109
that he sent one of those and an Abreu casing

47:10.203 --> 47:12.615
out to the Jefferson Parish ballistics lab

47:12.706 --> 47:16.290
because the Orleans Parish lab
was nonfunctioning at the time.

47:16.501 --> 47:18.617
I thought there were no forensic ballistics
in Abreu.

47:18.712 --> 47:20.794
As far as I know, there weren't.

47:20.880 --> 47:24.213
Casings from the scene disappeared
between Fifth District and the First.

47:24.300 --> 47:25.801
But according to Colson,

47:25.885 --> 47:29.127
the coroner's office found a casing later

47:29.222 --> 47:33.591
in Joey's clothing during the autopsy,
which is something he never told me.

47:35.687 --> 47:39.020
And this Abreu casing
just happened to get lost, too?

47:39.107 --> 47:42.270
Between NOPD and the Jeff Parish lab.

47:44.112 --> 47:46.319
And if he says that he sent it over,

47:47.365 --> 47:49.356
NOPD is off the hook when it goes missing.

47:52.704 --> 47:54.786
If Colson is trying
to make evidence disappear,

47:54.873 --> 47:56.989
why write it up at all?

47:57.083 --> 47:59.199
If he doesn't, it's on homicide. It's on him.

47:59.294 --> 48:00.704
-Right.
-I gave him the Seals casings.

48:00.795 --> 48:03.207
He signed for them.

48:03.298 --> 48:05.289
He's in on this cover-up.

48:05.383 --> 48:07.374
(SIGHS)

48:08.803 --> 48:10.839
This reporter, or whatever he is, blogger,

48:10.930 --> 48:14.058
has been to Homeland Security
on the Glover thing.

48:14.142 --> 48:16.554
Him or anybody else comes
around asking about that,

48:16.644 --> 48:20.637
information, questions,
it goes to PIO. Understood?

48:23.777 --> 48:25.313
Terry, a word.

48:30.158 --> 48:31.523
Captain.

48:31.618 --> 48:34.655
Rumor going around.
Somebody talking out of school.

48:36.164 --> 48:37.404
You know who?

48:37.499 --> 48:40.616
No. Feds are sniffing around.

48:41.252 --> 48:45.336
Yeah. Well, hear anything...

49:03.191 --> 49:04.180
What?

49:13.910 --> 49:14.990
(HAMMERING)

49:23.545 --> 49:25.206
Yeah, right here.

49:34.389 --> 49:35.424
Can I help you with something?

49:36.141 --> 49:37.881
Four months ago,
y'all was fixing this place up.

49:37.976 --> 49:39.386
Now you're fixing to tear it down?

49:39.477 --> 49:41.308
Hold on, hold on. Slow down, now.

49:41.396 --> 49:42.431
Don't tell me slow down.

49:42.522 --> 49:45.138
Y'all the ones in a hurry
to bulldoze the goddamn city.

49:45.233 --> 49:48.475
The city wanted it fixed up.
Now they want it tore down.

49:48.570 --> 49:51.232
-What you taking pictures for?
-I'm documenting this shit.

49:51.322 --> 49:53.608
-And the photos are going up on the website.
-(CAMERA BEEPS)

49:53.700 --> 49:56.066
You don't need no pictures
of me up on no website.

49:56.161 --> 49:59.324
I'm just a man trying to feed my family,
keep a roof over our head.

49:59.414 --> 50:02.577
-Keep a roof over your head? Shit.
-(CAMERA BEEPS)

50:02.917 --> 50:04.498
Come on now.

50:09.883 --> 50:12.169
It bit his foot off
and it was bleeding all over the place.

50:12.260 --> 50:14.672
-Don't give me that look.
-Alcide.

50:14.762 --> 50:16.013
There are glasses on the counter.

50:16.097 --> 50:18.839
Would you please fill them with water?

50:18.933 --> 50:20.389
Okay, so, Mama,
guess what happened at school today.

50:20.476 --> 50:22.683
-Thank you.
-So the second grade teacher,

50:22.770 --> 50:25.182
she brought a turtle to school,
and then it bit the kid.

50:25.273 --> 50:27.685
-(PHONE RlNGlNG)
-I'II get it.

50:33.907 --> 50:35.113
-(BEEP)
-Hello.

50:40.288 --> 50:42.279
How'd you get this number?

50:44.083 --> 50:45.118
Boys, go to your room, please.

50:45.543 --> 50:47.124
-What's wrong?
-Just go.

50:47.212 --> 50:48.201
(PHONE BEEPS)

50:55.303 --> 50:56.292
(BEEP)

50:56.387 --> 50:58.799
It's a private number.

50:58.890 --> 51:00.050
What'd he say?

51:01.434 --> 51:04.847
"You want to get fucked again?
Keep doing what you're doing."

51:04.938 --> 51:08.806
I said, "How'd you get this number?"
He said, "Bitch, we know where you live."

51:09.067 --> 51:11.228
I'm gonna get this number changed
first thing in the morning.

51:11.319 --> 51:13.184
But right now, I'm calling the police.

51:13.488 --> 51:14.819
What good is that gonna do?

51:14.906 --> 51:18.069
We need to start documenting this,
this harassment.

51:18.159 --> 51:19.148
(BEEPS)

51:19.827 --> 51:21.533
Do it after dinner, baby.

51:22.038 --> 51:24.324
After dinner, baby.

51:24.832 --> 51:27.960
Call Randall and Alcide.

51:28.044 --> 51:30.831
'Cause we ain't living under no fucking rock.

When I see one

51:40.556 --> 51:44.265
That's why how come I got these

51:44.352 --> 51:48.391
10 carat blues, yeah...

51:48.481 --> 51:50.472
-WOMAN: Sing it.
-(CROWD CHEERING).

51:58.825 --> 52:03.319
Ooh, that piano player is cute as a bug.

52:05.206 --> 52:07.948
Yes, he's very cute and too young for you.

52:08.042 --> 52:09.907
-Another.
-You bet.

52:12.046 --> 52:15.459
Slow down, sailor. The night is young.

52:15.550 --> 52:18.542
Exactly. And I intend to get shit-faced.

52:19.304 --> 52:21.795
Careful.
We don't want to put that sign back up again.

52:21.889 --> 52:23.049
Oh, which sign is that?

52:24.142 --> 52:27.851
"If your name is Davis McAlary, please leave."

52:27.937 --> 52:31.475
I am past that phase of my life, so...

52:33.568 --> 52:35.900
And where's Annie tonight?

52:36.070 --> 52:37.935
Gig, Howlin' Wolf.

52:38.031 --> 52:42.320
Opening for Dragon Smoke,
Ivan Neville's side project.

52:42.410 --> 52:44.696
-And you didn't go?
-Mm.

52:44.787 --> 52:47.574
She's going out to dinner
with her manager after,

52:47.874 --> 52:50.866
to talk about her new record.

52:50.960 --> 52:53.372
Oh, Davis.

52:54.422 --> 52:58.665
I know it did not turn out
exactly the way you wanted it,

52:58.760 --> 53:03.424
but, really, it is fine.

53:07.560 --> 53:09.767
ljust feel...

53:11.356 --> 53:15.144
At this point in my life,
I ought to have more control.

53:16.069 --> 53:19.152
Everything's just...

53:20.198 --> 53:23.315
Off, you know?

53:23.409 --> 53:26.025
My music, my career.

53:26.120 --> 53:28.987
You and Annie?

53:29.123 --> 53:34.117
You know, you might try
putting her first for a change.

53:35.630 --> 53:38.747
I think maybe she feels neglected, too.

53:40.009 --> 53:42.091
(SINGING) Do right

53:42.178 --> 53:45.796
-(CHEERING)
-MAN: Sing it, sister.

53:51.062 --> 53:52.893
ANNIE: I'm glad you like it.

53:52.980 --> 53:56.188
I finished it, like, seconds before the gig.

53:56.275 --> 53:59.358
It's half Harley's, the basic lyric.

53:59.445 --> 54:01.276
And Iwrote the music.

54:01.364 --> 54:04.071
And This City,
you wrote part of that, too, right?

54:04.158 --> 54:06.774
No, ljust gave him a line, that's all.

54:06.869 --> 54:09.406
Tell me something.
You think all those Lennon-McCartney songs,

54:09.497 --> 54:10.782
they wrote them all 50-50?

54:11.999 --> 54:15.241
No, that's what a creative partnership is.

54:15.336 --> 54:18.703
Bread don't rise without yeast,
even though you only use a spoonful.

54:20.216 --> 54:21.706
I guess.

54:22.176 --> 54:24.633
You need to share credit on This City, too.

54:29.976 --> 54:32.183

55:47.178 --> 55:49.635
-You have laundry I can do?
-No, I'll do it.

55:51.182 --> 55:53.764
-Sweetie, if there's anything you want...
-I'm fine.
