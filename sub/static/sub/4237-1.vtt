00:13.514 --> 00:16.250
(woman humming lullaby)

00:18.086 --> 00:22.223
(woman singing)

01:44.405 --> 01:46.640
(woman 1)
You don't think
it was an accident?

01:46.674 --> 01:49.243
(woman 2)
It just doesn't...

01:49.277 --> 01:51.779
something about it doesn't
sit right, you know?

01:51.812 --> 01:53.514
I mean, she knew diving.

01:53.547 --> 01:57.351
She knew that lake
so well.

01:57.385 --> 02:00.454
And she knew no one would
be able to find her in it.

02:00.488 --> 02:03.524
She was dumb to go
diving by herself.

02:12.266 --> 02:15.803
(woman 1)
Do you guys think
Mom was reincarnated?

02:15.836 --> 02:19.607
(woman 3)
I don't know. Maybe.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.209
(woman 2)
She told me this story

02:21.242 --> 02:22.810
of, um, the river
of forgetting.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.612
Do you guys...
Have you heard that?

02:24.645 --> 02:26.280
(woman 1)
No.

02:26.314 --> 02:29.183
(woman 2)
She said before you're born,

02:29.217 --> 02:32.653
your soul travels across
the river of forgetting,

02:32.686 --> 02:36.524
and it just wipes
your memory clean,

02:36.557 --> 02:40.861
so that you can go be born
again, into a new life.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.897
You just keep doing this
over and over again,

02:43.931 --> 02:45.833
lifetime over
lifetime, you know,

02:45.866 --> 02:49.503
just the... the cycle
of reincarnation.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.341
And finally once you...
Your soul has learned

02:53.374 --> 02:55.676
everything that it's
supposed to learn,

02:55.709 --> 03:01.549
then you get to travel back
over the river of remembering.

03:02.850 --> 03:07.288
And all your
previous selves

03:07.321 --> 03:09.990
come together, being one
with everything

03:10.023 --> 03:14.962
that has come before,
and is, and will come.

03:30.378 --> 03:34.915
(woman 1)
It's weird to think
that Mom's still down there.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.850
(woman 2)
I think it's fitting.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.853
She loved the
lake so much.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.323
It's where she'd
want to be.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.928
(woman 1)
When was the last
time you were home?

03:47.961 --> 03:50.531
(woman 3)
Not since before
I got married.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.767
(woman 1)
Didn't you
miss the lake?

03:53.801 --> 03:55.536
(woman 3)
Nope.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.246
(woman 1)
Are you okay?

04:07.415 --> 04:09.783
Yeah.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.485
Should we go down?

04:14.822 --> 04:16.490
You go ahead.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.560
Seriously, go ahead.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.321
(waves crashing)

05:09.477 --> 05:11.345
It's cold.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.552
(woman 2)
Are you still
afraid of swimming?

05:18.586 --> 05:20.954
(woman 1)
Mmm...

05:20.988 --> 05:23.424
I think I probably am.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.066
Is that Josh?

05:33.100 --> 05:35.403
Do you remember
Josh Jasper?

05:35.436 --> 05:36.169
No.
No?

05:36.203 --> 05:37.671
Annie was, like,
obsessed with him.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.807
Like, sick obsessed.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.942
Hey, Josh?

05:41.975 --> 05:44.478
Are you Josh Jasper?

05:44.512 --> 05:46.547
Yeah, who's that?

05:46.580 --> 05:50.818
Uh, we're Annie's
sisters, Isa and June.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.152
Annie here?

05:52.185 --> 05:53.887
Yeah, she is.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.824
You should come over
for dinner tonight.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.859
Uh, thanks, I got...

05:58.892 --> 06:00.494
I got stuff I gotta do,
but thanks.

06:00.528 --> 06:03.831
No, you have to,
she's gonna be so excited.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.735
(Isa)
Yes.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.069
(Josh)
So, the home ec teachers...

06:09.102 --> 06:10.538
We were making
chocolate freshman year.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.605
Yeah.
For a parfait...

06:11.639 --> 06:13.441
We had to make
parfaits, right?

06:13.474 --> 06:15.809
And Annie, she had to
make chocolate mousse,

06:15.843 --> 06:17.044
and she messed up 'cause
she got the yogurt.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.612
And she poured, like,
cinnamon on top,

06:18.646 --> 06:20.748
but the top fell off and
all the cinnamon was like...

06:20.781 --> 06:21.882
(Isa laughing)

06:21.915 --> 06:23.951
And she got so upset.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.587
(muffled conversation
continues)

06:30.791 --> 06:33.994
Dinner's ready!

06:34.027 --> 06:35.829
Okay, here we go.

06:35.863 --> 06:39.433
(Isa laughing)
Sorry it's just pasta.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.835
I didn't realize we would
be entertaining tonight.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.071
It looks beautiful.

06:46.607 --> 06:47.775
Big camera.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.810
(June laughing)

06:49.843 --> 06:51.812
Is it digital,
is it...?

06:51.845 --> 06:53.146
(June)
Mm-hmm.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.882
So, we're in your
documentary?

06:54.915 --> 06:57.551
(all laughing)

06:57.585 --> 06:59.787
(June)
Right now you are.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.556
(Josh)
Aren't you gonna eat?

07:02.590 --> 07:03.924
(June)
No.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.094
June only eats alone.

07:08.061 --> 07:11.465
Mmm, I mean,
you gotta be hungry.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.833
(June)
I said no.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.968
She has since
she was little.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.605
It's not really
like a big deal.

07:17.638 --> 07:18.706
Do you want
some more pasta?

07:18.739 --> 07:21.141
I eat alone
a lot too, so...

07:21.174 --> 07:22.843
Parmesan?
Yeah, please.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.645
Yeah.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.547
Okay.

07:26.580 --> 07:30.718
So, you see how the lines
of your palm are shallow?

07:30.751 --> 07:32.119
Mmm.

07:32.152 --> 07:35.155
Um, it just means that
you're a young soul.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.926
Is that good?

07:38.959 --> 07:40.794
Um, well, it's neither
good or bad.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.063
It's just...
It just means that

07:43.096 --> 07:47.234
you have to come back
for more lifetimes...
Oh.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.803
To continue learning.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.204
(Isa)
Two kids.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.906
That's true too.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.208
Who'd you have
two kids with?

07:58.846 --> 08:00.681
Remember Molly
from high school?

08:00.714 --> 08:01.849
Yeah.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.151
Well done,
she was a babe.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.488
Yeah, she was.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.726
We're not
together anymore.

08:12.760 --> 08:16.096
Um, sorry to
hear that.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.798
Yeah.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.169
Yeah, it's been
a rough summer.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.640
That it has.

08:26.674 --> 08:29.577
For all of us.
Mm-hmm.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.144
I wanted to tell
you guys

08:31.178 --> 08:34.582
how sorry I am
about your mom.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.850
(Annie and Isa)
Thanks.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.686
Yeah, there's a bunch
of us who tried to help,

08:38.719 --> 08:40.520
and, um...

08:41.789 --> 08:44.592
you know, by the time
they got some divers,

08:44.625 --> 08:47.160
I think it's... you know,
it was just too deep.

08:50.130 --> 08:54.001
How'd you hear
about it?

08:54.034 --> 08:56.203
Through the
Sheriff's Department.

08:56.236 --> 09:01.775
Like... five days
after the fact.

09:01.809 --> 09:04.612
Guess they had a
hard time finding us.

09:09.717 --> 09:13.987
So, are you... you guys here
for a memorial, or what?

09:14.021 --> 09:15.355
No.
No, no.

09:15.388 --> 09:20.127
She was clear she didn't
want that kind of thing.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.863
We're just here to, you know,
figure out the next step

09:22.896 --> 09:25.933
and take care of
some affairs.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.169
Mmm.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.772
(Isa)
The, like, coming back home

09:31.805 --> 09:33.774
is... is the part

09:33.807 --> 09:38.045
that makes you feel,
like, so strange.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.715
It's... it's like
this lake has a power.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.284
I can't explain it,
it's like a draw.

09:44.317 --> 09:47.387
(Josh)
You know, no one's
ever found the bottom.

09:47.420 --> 09:51.158
It's pretty strange.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.861
(June)
Remember that story
that Mom used to tell us?

09:53.894 --> 09:56.196
The one about the
seven sisters?

09:56.229 --> 09:56.964
(Isa)
Yeah.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.132
Do you remember?
I do, I do, I do.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.068
So, like, what...

10:01.101 --> 10:03.871
So, the first sister
jumps in, and...

10:03.904 --> 10:05.906
Mm-hmm?
She never resurfaces.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.908
So, then the second
sister jumps in

10:07.941 --> 10:10.778
to try and save her,
but she gets pulled down.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.012
Then the third sister
jumps in,

10:12.045 --> 10:14.882
tries to save that sister,
same thing happens.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.684
And one by one,
they all jump in

10:16.717 --> 10:18.151
trying to save each other,
and drown.

10:18.185 --> 10:22.255
The legend of the story
is that you can...

10:22.289 --> 10:24.191
go out at midnight

10:24.224 --> 10:27.895
and summon up the spirit
of the seventh sister.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.765
There have been people
who have seen her

10:31.799 --> 10:34.301
but, if you go swimming...

10:36.136 --> 10:41.775
there has been talk that it
may be the last time you swim.

10:41.809 --> 10:45.312
Oh, God,
it's so crazy.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.747
Ooh.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.849
What time is it?
(Isa laughing)

10:48.882 --> 10:50.117
(Annie)
Okay, so what do
we have to do

10:50.150 --> 10:52.185
to conjure the
seventh sister?

10:52.219 --> 10:54.421
First of all you have...
You have to be very quiet.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.890
No, no, you have to
speak from the heart.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.158
Speak from the heart.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.359
From the heart.
And be sincere.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.795
In order for the seventh
sister to arise

11:01.829 --> 11:03.897
and show herself,
you have to say

11:03.931 --> 11:06.734
"seventh sister"
seven... seven times.

11:06.767 --> 11:07.768
Seventh sister,
seventh Sister...

11:07.801 --> 11:09.737
No, no, no.
Not now!

11:09.770 --> 11:10.904
(girls laughing)
Shh, shh.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.706
You can't do it now.
Sorry.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.775
Because she's going to hear it
and nothing is going to happen.

11:14.808 --> 11:15.876
(whispering)
Guys, guys, wait, wait.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.812
What? What?
Wait. Wait.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.148
I think we
need candles.

11:21.181 --> 11:21.815
Yes.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.283
(June)
Yeah, definitely.

11:23.316 --> 11:23.984
Yeah.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.819
I think Mom
would have some.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.955
She has a whole bunch
of them in the basement.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.123
Okay, okay,
I'll be right back.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.225
Okay.
Do you want me
to come with you?

11:32.259 --> 11:33.927
Hurry.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.036
(June)
Is everybody ready?

11:43.070 --> 11:44.271
(Annie)
Yes.

11:44.304 --> 11:48.175
Okay, Is, tell it
to the camera.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.913
With the
permission of fire

11:52.946 --> 11:56.183
and the permission
of matter,

11:56.216 --> 11:58.752
we now begin.

11:58.786 --> 12:01.789
(women chanting)
Seventh sister,

12:01.822 --> 12:04.925
seventh sister,

12:04.958 --> 12:07.995
seventh sister,

12:08.028 --> 12:10.764
seventh sister,

12:10.798 --> 12:13.400
seventh sister,

12:13.433 --> 12:15.969
seventh sister,

12:16.003 --> 12:18.471
seventh sister.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.315
(Annie)
Did you hear that?

12:28.348 --> 12:29.883
(June)
What?
I heard something.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.551
(loud splash)

12:31.584 --> 12:33.987
(laughing)

12:34.021 --> 12:35.388
(June)
Why'd you do that?

12:35.422 --> 12:37.390
It's not...
It was him!

12:37.424 --> 12:38.992
(laughing)

12:39.026 --> 12:40.427
Well, that was a
disappointment.
Oh, well.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.162
(Annie laughing)
Oh, well.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.430
(Josh)
I'll have to tell
you the story

12:43.463 --> 12:44.898
about the seven
brothers next.

12:44.932 --> 12:45.933
Oh, God.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.467
(all laughing)

13:08.188 --> 13:12.125
(June)
Spirit of the seventh sister...

13:12.159 --> 13:14.294
(whispering)
I invoke thee.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.172
Did you hear that?

13:25.205 --> 13:26.840
(June)
Yeah.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.341
What was that?

13:28.375 --> 13:30.210
I don't know.

13:44.557 --> 13:45.625
(stair creaks)

13:45.658 --> 13:47.360
Shh.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.034
(laughing)

14:28.969 --> 14:31.138
(bang,
gasping)

14:35.408 --> 14:36.609
Should we go upstairs?

14:36.643 --> 14:38.478
No.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.626
Do you see
anything?

14:53.660 --> 14:55.929
No.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.998
Get the door.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.300
(wind blowing)

15:08.175 --> 15:11.478
(Isa)
What kind of bird
do you think it is?

15:11.511 --> 15:14.014
(June)
I don't know.

15:14.047 --> 15:17.584
It's got that
orange belly.

15:17.617 --> 15:21.121
And a pointy nose.

15:21.154 --> 15:24.491
Maybe it's a
woodpecker.

15:24.524 --> 15:25.725
(Annie)
Guys, what are you doing?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.694
It's the middle
of the night.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.597
What is that?

15:30.630 --> 15:32.632
It flew into
the window.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.734
Do birds even
fly at night?

15:34.767 --> 15:36.436
What is he doing
in the kitchen?

15:36.469 --> 15:39.606
How did you
get him in here?

15:39.639 --> 15:41.108
It's a wild animal.

15:41.141 --> 15:46.213
They have diseases,
guys.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.480
It's unsanitary.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.049
Isa,
don't touch it!

15:49.082 --> 15:52.185
Isa, don't touch it.
Okay, okay.

15:54.721 --> 15:58.425
I want to give it
a proper burial.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.060
Honey, let's just
take him outside, okay?

16:00.093 --> 16:01.294
Please don't put
it in the trash.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.762
We're not keeping
him inside right now.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.298
It's the middle of
the night, okay?

16:10.770 --> 16:13.240
Annie hates funerals.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.601
(waves crashing)

17:14.634 --> 17:16.303
Here we go.
(Isa)
Yeah.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.773
I don't know if
I wanna see this.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.810
Yeah!
This is so embarrassing.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.612
(singing)
Join me,

17:25.645 --> 17:28.315
in standing up to greed,

17:28.348 --> 17:31.418
(both singing)
and diving into blue.

17:37.557 --> 17:41.128
(music playing)

17:42.329 --> 17:44.864
(woman)
Though inland far we be,

17:44.897 --> 17:48.535
our souls have sight of
that immortal sea

17:48.568 --> 17:51.238
which brought us hither.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.478
That was
William Wordsworth.

17:58.511 --> 18:02.215
Hello, I am
Dr. Amelia Brooks

18:02.249 --> 18:04.484
and I am the founder
and president

18:04.517 --> 18:07.854
of the Blue Water
Conservation Society.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.827
If you love our beautiful
blue lake as much as I do,

18:14.861 --> 18:18.431
please, vote yes
on measure "F".

18:18.465 --> 18:22.869
Join me in
standing up to greed

18:22.902 --> 18:26.139
and diving into blue.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.552
(chuckles)

19:02.475 --> 19:06.413
(dialing phone number)

19:30.403 --> 19:33.506
Hi, may I please speak
to Dr. Amelia Brooks?

19:38.345 --> 19:42.315
Oh, well, do you know
when she might be back?

19:49.556 --> 19:51.391
Oh, no, I didn't.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.561
Oh.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.499
Oh, I'm so sorry.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.871
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

20:07.274 --> 20:09.509
No, thank you.
Bye.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.792
(woman)
These are the comparables
that are in your neighborhood

20:25.825 --> 20:27.394
that the appraiser
was working off of.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.496
You might wanna take
a peek at those.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.930
Okay.
And then um... oh!

20:30.963 --> 20:32.699
Will we do a...
Who's this?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.667
Oh, this is
our sister June.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.903
Oh!
Are you a photographer?

20:36.936 --> 20:38.305
(June)
Mm-hmm.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.473
(Annie)
She's our family archivist.

20:40.507 --> 20:41.841
That's neat.

20:41.874 --> 20:45.512
Um, will we have
to do photographs

20:45.545 --> 20:47.447
for our own comp card
or is that something

20:47.480 --> 20:48.915
that your agency does?

20:48.948 --> 20:52.319
Oh, um... definitely have
a phenomenal photographer

20:52.352 --> 20:53.586
that will come
out and, uh, take...

20:53.620 --> 20:54.687
I have a question, though.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.389
How is this like
a comparable

20:56.423 --> 21:00.793
if it's not on
the water, and...?

21:00.827 --> 21:02.662
Well, because
this is actually...

21:02.695 --> 21:04.063
You know,
it's a newer home,

21:04.096 --> 21:05.832
but because it's
not on the water,

21:05.865 --> 21:07.500
it's not gonna have
the same price.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.936
And due to the fact that
this is an older home

21:09.969 --> 21:11.638
and it has a
lot of issues...

21:11.671 --> 21:13.373
So they kinda of equal
each other out.

21:13.406 --> 21:14.173
Yeah.
Okay.

21:14.206 --> 21:15.942
Are you recording
that right now?

21:15.975 --> 21:18.711
Um, sorry.
It's not gonna be...

21:18.745 --> 21:20.079
She's just doing
a documentary.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.382
A documentary?
Okay.

21:22.415 --> 21:25.752
Um, okay, now my other
question is, um,

21:25.785 --> 21:28.020
do we have to
fix the roofing

21:28.054 --> 21:30.857
and the electrical problems
that the appraisers found,

21:30.890 --> 21:33.626
or can we just do a
faster, as-is sale?

21:33.660 --> 21:35.928
You know I think it's
really gonna be up to you.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.430
Okay.
I have to be honest...

21:37.464 --> 21:38.931
You know, if you wanna
make that investment,

21:38.965 --> 21:40.467
but I don't think you do.
Right.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.801
And I'm gonna
tell you right now,

21:41.834 --> 21:43.436
they're probably
just gonna bust

21:43.470 --> 21:44.671
the house down anyways.

21:44.704 --> 21:45.938
They're really
buying this house

21:45.972 --> 21:49.442
for the property itself.
Does this have to be on?

21:49.476 --> 21:51.478
If we have the
open house...
Yeah.

21:51.511 --> 21:52.945
And someone is interested
in buying it,

21:52.979 --> 21:54.447
Sure.
But then as we talk

21:54.481 --> 21:55.815
we decide we don't
wanna sell,

21:55.848 --> 21:56.949
like, that's fine,
right? Because...

21:56.983 --> 21:58.084
Well, we do want to sell.

21:58.117 --> 21:59.652
Well...
(sighs)

21:59.686 --> 22:01.020
No, I think that...

22:01.053 --> 22:02.922
It's too much of a
financial responsibility

22:02.955 --> 22:04.991
to put... you know,
having to fix the roof

22:05.024 --> 22:06.092
and pay the
property taxes

22:06.125 --> 22:07.427
and bring the electrical
up to code.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.995
Well, what if
there was a way

22:09.028 --> 22:10.963
to turn it into some
sort of rental unit or...

22:10.997 --> 22:12.732
But then who's gonna run
the rental property?

22:12.765 --> 22:13.966
That's a lot of
responsibility

22:14.000 --> 22:15.902
and I know that
I cannot take that on.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.404
You wouldn't wanna
take that on.

22:17.437 --> 22:18.538
No, and I think...

22:18.571 --> 22:21.941
I guess what
I'm hearing

22:21.974 --> 22:25.144
is that you've
already decided,

22:25.177 --> 22:27.914
and this is only
one-third yours.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.382
I don't think
I should be here.

22:29.416 --> 22:30.950
I think that you need to
have this conversation...

22:30.983 --> 22:32.685
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to make
it uncomfortable for you.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.521
It's okay.
We'll discuss.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.756
I think you need to get on
the same page because...

22:36.789 --> 22:38.157
Yes.
You don't want anyone

22:38.190 --> 22:40.059
walking in this door and
you're not ready to sell.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.628
Right.
I'll walk you out.

22:41.661 --> 22:42.762
All right,
sounds good.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.130
Difficult
decision for her.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.399
I understand, but I gotta
tell you right now...

22:46.433 --> 22:49.836
If my dad were to
give me a loan,

22:49.869 --> 22:53.172
then... I could fix

22:53.205 --> 22:56.175
the roof and...

22:56.208 --> 22:57.944
the other things,
and then...

22:57.977 --> 22:59.612
(Annie)
And then what?

22:59.646 --> 23:01.814
Well, that's the thing...
I was talking to June before,

23:01.848 --> 23:05.117
and it was like,
we could, um...

23:05.151 --> 23:09.055
like, rent it out for
different things.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.759
You know, like there's,
like, so many yoga schools

23:12.792 --> 23:15.061
that rent out places
to do retreats,

23:15.094 --> 23:17.797
and, like, art programs
and just...

23:17.830 --> 23:19.732
I mean, what do
you think, June?

23:19.766 --> 23:21.468
Do you...?

23:23.002 --> 23:25.438
What do you
wanna do, Junie?

23:27.039 --> 23:30.743
(June)
I don't really feel
like it's my decision.

23:30.777 --> 23:34.113
I mean, it's Mom's house.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.583
(humming)

23:41.253 --> 23:42.955
(laughing)

23:42.989 --> 23:44.090
Aah!

23:44.123 --> 23:48.094
(laughing)

23:48.127 --> 23:49.796
Uhh!

23:49.829 --> 23:52.699
Annie, come in!

23:52.732 --> 23:54.667
No way.
It's too cold.

23:54.701 --> 23:56.202
No, it warms up...

23:56.235 --> 23:59.138
once you're in it for
like a few seconds.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.743
Once you're in there,
for a few seconds...

24:03.776 --> 24:06.012
(laughing)
No!

24:06.045 --> 24:07.079
Come on,
grab her feet.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.915
No! No!
Let's go!

24:08.948 --> 24:11.217
Wait, we're gonna make
her drink first.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.919
(laughing)

24:14.253 --> 24:16.956
(singing)
Miss Spirit Lake!

24:16.989 --> 24:19.058
Welcome back,
ladies and gentleman

24:19.091 --> 24:21.594
to the Little Miss
Spirit Lake competition.

24:21.628 --> 24:24.964
We've now moved on to the
swimsuit portion of the evening.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.966
Now, you may be confused,
you may think

24:26.999 --> 24:29.068
that this is
a swimsuit, but it's not.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.571
However... it doesn't
really matter,

24:31.604 --> 24:33.606
'cause guess who's
gonna be nice and warm

24:33.640 --> 24:37.510
and dry and cozy on the
way home, unlike...

24:37.544 --> 24:39.946
these two right here.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.248
You should be
drunk every day.

24:42.281 --> 24:45.184
I am.
Wait, I felt something.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.619
What?

24:46.653 --> 24:48.054
Come on.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.657
Seriously, I felt
something touch my foot.

24:50.690 --> 24:53.125
(mocking)
Seriously, I felt
something touch my foot.

24:53.159 --> 24:56.095
It was so scary.
It was so scary.

24:56.128 --> 24:57.630
(Isa and Josh scream)

24:58.665 --> 24:59.999
Is?

25:01.634 --> 25:03.035
(June)
Isa?

25:07.774 --> 25:09.241
Isa?

25:10.577 --> 25:11.644
Isa!

25:11.678 --> 25:12.845
(June)
Oh, my God!

25:12.879 --> 25:15.582
(panicked breathing)

25:15.615 --> 25:17.984
(laughing)

25:18.017 --> 25:20.753
I'm sorry!
It was...

25:20.787 --> 25:22.154
(Annie)
Screw you.
No, no.

25:22.188 --> 25:22.922
It's not funny!

25:22.955 --> 25:24.657
Annie, it was a joke.
Whatever.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.859
Oh, come on, Annie!

25:26.893 --> 25:28.127
Geez.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.897
Annie, I'm sorry,
it was just a joke.

25:37.169 --> 25:39.071
(Josh)
Annie, come on!

25:42.174 --> 25:44.310
Annie!

25:44.343 --> 25:45.845
My leg!
(chuckles)

25:45.878 --> 25:47.614
It's not funny.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.719
(June)
That wasn't
too funny, you guys.

25:52.752 --> 25:53.820
(Josh)
Huh?

25:53.853 --> 25:55.321
That wasn't very funny.

25:55.354 --> 25:57.256
Oh, come on.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.729
You coming in?

26:02.762 --> 26:04.296
No.
Come on.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.604
(June)
You okay, Annie?

26:11.638 --> 26:13.005
I'm fine.

26:13.039 --> 26:16.042
I can't do the camera
right now, June. Sorry.

26:38.765 --> 26:41.333
(humming)

26:44.036 --> 26:48.240
(humming continues)

26:55.047 --> 26:57.650
(Isa)
He's a good person, you know?

26:59.886 --> 27:03.289
He's kind of
different than...

27:03.322 --> 27:08.027
the normal kind of guy
I'm attracted to usually.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.997
(June)
I think he really likes you.

27:13.465 --> 27:18.137
Yeah, I think that he...

27:20.740 --> 27:23.375
the way that he
likes people...

27:25.144 --> 27:27.346
would be really good for me.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.249
(sighs)

27:42.228 --> 27:44.764
(Isa)
Okay, now I'm ready.

27:44.797 --> 27:47.033
So, tell me from
the beginning.

27:47.066 --> 27:51.437
Um, okay, so, uh,
there were seven sisters,

27:51.470 --> 27:54.874
and they were walking
in a field with their mother,

27:54.907 --> 27:56.876
and Orion saw them
walking through the field,

27:56.909 --> 27:59.011
and he fell madly in
love with them,

27:59.045 --> 28:01.180
and he pursued them.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.783
He chased them everywhere
for years and years.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.852
And finally,
after seven years,

28:05.885 --> 28:09.021
Zeus answered their...
Their prayers,

28:09.055 --> 28:12.992
and he turned them into birds
so they could fly away.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.027
And they flew up
into the sky,

28:15.061 --> 28:16.996
and then they
became stars.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.397
They became
the Pleiades.

28:18.430 --> 28:21.167
Okay, but tell me...
Tell me the weird part.

28:21.200 --> 28:25.137
Okay, the weird part
is that...

28:27.173 --> 28:30.743
there... there are
seven sisters,

28:30.777 --> 28:33.746
but there are
actually only six stars

28:33.780 --> 28:35.882
that are visible to
the naked eye.

28:35.915 --> 28:40.853
And in spite of that,
in almost every culture,

28:40.887 --> 28:43.022
the constellation is called
the seven sisters.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.024
So, there's this
seventh star

28:45.057 --> 28:48.160
that everybody seems to know
is there and it is there,

28:48.194 --> 28:50.897
but it's completely
invisible.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.933
And I just think
that's really interesting.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.148
Shh.

30:03.435 --> 30:04.937
(Annie)
June?

30:04.971 --> 30:07.473
(Isa)
June?

30:07.506 --> 30:09.008
(Annie)
June!

30:09.041 --> 30:14.513
(June)
I'm over here!

30:14.546 --> 30:17.449
(Annie)
Oh, God, oh...

30:17.483 --> 30:19.986
Jesus Christ, June,
you really scared me.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.187
Why?
What'd I do?

30:21.220 --> 30:22.454
Well, I heard a noise
and woke up

30:22.488 --> 30:23.856
but you weren't there.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.524
What are you even
doing out here?

30:25.557 --> 30:27.493
I wanted to
go swimming.

30:27.526 --> 30:30.262
In the middle
of the night?

30:30.296 --> 30:33.132
Please don't do
this to me again.

30:36.568 --> 30:38.470
We found another bird.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.245
(Isa)
Don't you think it's
a little strange

30:46.278 --> 30:48.247
that this is the
second night in a row

30:48.280 --> 30:50.482
that it's happened?

30:50.516 --> 30:53.385
(Annie)
Maybe it's the
change in weather.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.955
They just got confused.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.258
Yeah, but birds
fly south.

30:59.291 --> 31:02.161
They just don't
fall out of the sky.

31:06.432 --> 31:10.569
(June)
You don't think that Josh
would be doing this, do you?

31:10.602 --> 31:12.371
No.
No.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.476
I'm sorry I scared
you guys.

31:21.013 --> 31:24.250
Josh, you didn't leave
the birds, did you?

31:24.283 --> 31:25.417
No.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.919
Are you sure?

31:26.953 --> 31:28.487
Yeah, I'm sure.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.456
I thought you might be
trying to scare us

31:30.489 --> 31:33.059
'cause of the whole
seven sisters thing?

31:33.092 --> 31:34.460
No.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.198
(Isa)
It's just totally
disrespectful,

31:39.231 --> 31:43.202
Annie just put
them in the trash.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.605
(Josh)
Certain time of the day

31:46.638 --> 31:48.240
that my dad calls
the change over.

31:48.274 --> 31:52.011
It's right when the
sun is about to set.

31:52.044 --> 31:55.214
Everything goes silent.

31:55.247 --> 31:59.318
All the waves in the lake
just kind of stop.

31:59.351 --> 32:01.520
It only happens on this lake,
and I've been to a lot...

32:01.553 --> 32:03.122
Really?
I've never noticed that.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.457
Wait, you got one!
Okay, what do I do?

32:05.491 --> 32:06.725
What do I do?
Adjust the drag.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.194
Right here, right here.
Yeah, okay.

32:08.227 --> 32:09.395
June, you gotta
back up, June...
Ow!

32:09.428 --> 32:10.129
Back up June!

32:10.162 --> 32:11.630
All right, get up,
get it up.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.599
(laughs)
Stand up.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.034
Reel it in.
Okay, okay.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.735
It feels... ah!
You got it, you got it!

32:16.768 --> 32:18.437
Feels really heavy.
It's coming.

32:18.470 --> 32:19.972
Oh! What?
Wow.

32:20.006 --> 32:21.473
What is that?

32:21.507 --> 32:23.575
It's definitely
not a fish.

32:23.609 --> 32:27.446
No, that is...
it's a red fish.

32:27.479 --> 32:28.647
Yeah right,
yeah, you do it.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.550
I got it, I got it.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.552
This is your first...
First catch?

32:33.585 --> 32:35.221
(laughing)
Yeah.

32:35.254 --> 32:37.256
And it's...

32:39.625 --> 32:41.460
Here, June.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.506
I like this way better
than a fish.

32:54.540 --> 32:57.009
(Josh)
You guys wanna get going?

32:57.043 --> 33:01.480
Um, kinda wanna ride
the roller coaster.

33:01.513 --> 33:05.184
The roller coaster's been
closed since Labor Day.

33:05.217 --> 33:06.318
I know.

33:07.386 --> 33:08.387
(Josh)
Come on.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.156
You can do it.
I'll catch you.

33:10.189 --> 33:13.625
Here, take that.
Put it over there.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.761
You're so bossy.
(laughing)

33:15.794 --> 33:17.229
I'm not bossy.
"Put it over there!"

33:17.263 --> 33:18.664
"Here, take this.
Put it over there!"

33:18.697 --> 33:20.066
(laughing)

33:20.099 --> 33:21.233
All right,
you ready to catch me?

33:21.267 --> 33:23.269
Yeah, I'll catch you.
Good.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.477
(Isa humming)

33:38.650 --> 33:40.519
(laughing)

33:43.789 --> 33:45.757
(continues humming)

33:53.399 --> 33:56.135
I feel like the lake
gave this to me.

33:59.271 --> 34:00.839
(June)
I want one.

34:00.872 --> 34:05.311
Well... you chose
not to fish.

34:07.179 --> 34:11.516
You have to throw your
line in to catch something.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.663
Annie?

34:24.696 --> 34:26.398
(Josh)
Is she here?
Look.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.100
Oh, here she is.
Wow.

34:28.134 --> 34:29.534
How are you?
Hey, Annie!

34:29.568 --> 34:31.237
You guys were fishing?

34:31.270 --> 34:32.504
(Josh)
Yeah, we didn't
catch anything.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.172
(Isa)
Yeah, we didn't
really catch anything.

34:34.206 --> 34:35.574
We were just trying to...

34:35.607 --> 34:37.109
(Isa and Josh laugh)

34:37.143 --> 34:38.210
Well, I didn't
realize that you guys

34:38.244 --> 34:39.378
had a fishing trip
planned,

34:39.411 --> 34:41.780
so I was, um,
just gonna do

34:41.813 --> 34:43.514
like a sisters' breakfast,

34:43.549 --> 34:45.650
because we haven't really
had a chance to talk.

34:45.684 --> 34:48.320
But if you'd like to stay,
I can set a place for you.

34:48.353 --> 34:49.821
No I got... I got stuff
to do. That's fine.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.123
You sure?
Yeah.

34:51.157 --> 34:52.491
(Isa)
Yeah.
Yeah.

34:52.524 --> 34:54.226
See you later.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.262
Bye, June.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.436
Um, I was
actually thinking

35:04.470 --> 35:08.707
that maybe we could do like
a full sisters' day today.

35:08.740 --> 35:09.775
Take a break from...

35:09.808 --> 35:11.577
Like a half-sisters' day.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.579
What?

35:13.612 --> 35:15.914
Like a
half-sisters' day.

35:15.947 --> 35:19.818
It was just a joke, 'cause you
said like a full sisters' day.

35:26.492 --> 35:27.693
Go on.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.861
Um, I don't know.

35:29.895 --> 35:32.298
I was thinking I could maybe
take you guys shopping

35:32.331 --> 35:37.403
and we could get some
manicures and pedicures.

35:40.339 --> 35:43.342
We could go out
for lunch.

35:43.375 --> 35:44.843
(sighs)

35:47.513 --> 35:49.648
I mean, that's a big part
of this trip for me,

35:49.681 --> 35:51.950
is spending time
with you guys.

35:51.983 --> 35:55.521
So, I just thought
that it would be fun.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.789
I mean, we don't have to.
We can stay here.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.825
Or you can...

35:59.858 --> 36:01.793
you know, hang out
with Josh or whatever.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.396
(scoffs)
No, it...

36:04.430 --> 36:06.432
No, it's not like I wanna
hang out with Josh

36:06.465 --> 36:07.966
over you guys.
I just think it's funny

36:07.999 --> 36:09.868
that all of a sudden,
you're, like,

36:09.901 --> 36:13.372
all, like, about family,
and... spending time...

36:13.405 --> 36:15.274
All of a sudden,
like all about family?

36:15.307 --> 36:17.909
Yeah, all of
a sudden. I mean...

36:19.278 --> 36:21.380
This is like the first
time you've been home in...

36:21.413 --> 36:24.750
In like over ten years...
You said it yourself.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.585
So, it's just
funny that...

36:26.618 --> 36:29.488
That doesn't mean that
I don't care about you,

36:29.521 --> 36:31.357
and that I haven't made
a lot of efforts.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.725
I've invited you to
Chicago so many times.

36:33.759 --> 36:34.793
No, I know, it's...

36:34.826 --> 36:36.262
And you've each
come once.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.397
One time.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.999
It's more like...

36:41.032 --> 36:45.203
I don't think you're,
like, aware of how hard...

36:46.505 --> 36:48.374
(sighs)

36:58.317 --> 36:59.985
I just... I don't
think you're aware

37:00.018 --> 37:02.688
of hard it was for Mom...
(scoffs)

37:02.721 --> 37:06.792
to not have, like,
reconciled with you.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.831
Well...

37:12.864 --> 37:18.270
that is...
Mom's cross to bear.

37:18.304 --> 37:21.407
Well,
but it's yours too.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.808
She wanted so badly

37:22.841 --> 37:24.810
to just have everything
be okay with you,

37:24.843 --> 37:28.013
(laughs)
to the point where, like...

37:28.046 --> 37:30.416
Go look in
that bedroom.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.551
She brought the crib up
and, like, put toys in it.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.052
She was so excited that you
were gonna have a baby...

37:34.085 --> 37:35.787
That has nothing
to do with me.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.389
Yeah it does, it does.
The crib had
nothing to do with me.

37:37.423 --> 37:39.925
It was like a chance
to reconnect with you,

37:39.958 --> 37:43.695
for you to be a mother and,
like, know what it's like.

37:43.729 --> 37:46.632
When I called her to tell
her that I was pregnant,

37:46.665 --> 37:50.469
she barely
acknowledged that.

37:50.502 --> 37:52.738
She immediately started
talking about

37:52.771 --> 37:54.773
something to do with
the lake, and, like,

37:54.806 --> 37:58.710
it was like,
"Oh, that's nice honey."

37:58.744 --> 38:00.646
She didn't care.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.714
No, she... she did care.

38:02.748 --> 38:05.484
I mean, she set
the crib up herself,

38:05.517 --> 38:07.753
and she brought out...
Out all of our toys,

38:07.786 --> 38:11.590
and, you know...

38:11.623 --> 38:13.959
Well, I'm sorry that my
miscarriage was so selfish,

38:13.992 --> 38:17.363
so inconvenient for her.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.930
(Annie)
God, I don't know
what I was thinking.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.566
(Isa)
Annie, that's not what
I'm talking about.

38:20.599 --> 38:21.900
She made it about her

38:21.933 --> 38:24.436
just like she made
everything about her.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.800
(boat motor running)

39:09.180 --> 39:12.451
(Isa)
And um, well,
it's basically the idea

39:12.484 --> 39:15.787
of before you're born,
your soul has to cross

39:15.821 --> 39:17.989
over the river of forgetting.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.460
And that sort of wipes
its memory clean

39:21.493 --> 39:23.962
of the life it had
just lived, so you can go

39:23.995 --> 39:25.764
into the next one.
(Josh)
Hmm.

39:25.797 --> 39:29.100
And it just keeps happening,
you know, at the end of life,

39:29.134 --> 39:30.936
just over and over again,

39:30.969 --> 39:33.371
different cycles
of reincarnation.

39:35.040 --> 39:39.077
There's something
very comforting

39:39.110 --> 39:42.714
about knowing you've
already learned things

39:42.748 --> 39:44.950
and had just forgotten them.
Huh.

39:44.983 --> 39:48.520
Like, you just don't
know how to see them.

39:48.554 --> 39:50.822
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

39:50.856 --> 39:53.825
I think if we could remember

39:53.859 --> 39:58.664
our past lives when we
were first babies,

39:58.697 --> 40:00.799
we might not want to live.

40:07.706 --> 40:09.475
(wind blowing)

40:15.514 --> 40:18.750
Haven't been to Mom's lab
since I was little.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.952
(June)
Me neither.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.822
We should go.

40:23.855 --> 40:26.024
These are Amelia's
daughters... they're here

40:26.057 --> 40:27.626
to look at some of their
mother's things.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.828
Hey, welcome,
come on in.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.535
And this was her desk.

40:38.236 --> 40:41.006
I'll be in the other room
if you need anything.

40:52.884 --> 40:55.721
(June)
Oh, my God. Isa!

40:55.754 --> 40:58.790
It's the seven sisters.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.592
(Isa)
That's so weird.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.230
Do you remember how
Mom used to say

41:05.263 --> 41:07.065
when she was going
deep water diving,

41:07.098 --> 41:10.235
that she was going
for a space walk?

41:10.268 --> 41:12.804
Did she really
used to say that?

41:12.838 --> 41:14.472
Yeah.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.976
Hmm.

41:18.009 --> 41:19.511
This is the lake.

41:19.545 --> 41:20.612
Hmm.

41:20.646 --> 41:23.982
"August 18th,
170 feet.

41:24.015 --> 41:25.851
Fear, sadness."

41:25.884 --> 41:28.554
"August 25th,
190 feet.

41:28.587 --> 41:31.122
Sadness,
nostalgia."

41:35.126 --> 41:39.865
"August 31st,
200 feet."

41:39.898 --> 41:42.968
She wrote
"Fear subsides."

41:43.001 --> 41:46.538
"Deep samples
resemble...

41:47.739 --> 41:50.909
amniotic fluid?"

41:50.942 --> 41:52.143
(Josh)
What's in the fridge?

41:52.177 --> 41:55.113
Oh, that's where we
keep our samples.

41:55.146 --> 41:57.749
(Isa)
I wonder if
they still have

41:57.783 --> 42:00.151
some of Mom's
samples in there.

42:40.659 --> 42:43.294
(June chuckling)

43:51.763 --> 43:54.032
(baby mobile playing)

44:10.315 --> 44:12.784
(Annie)
I don't think
she was excited.

44:12.818 --> 44:15.320
(baby mobile continues playing)

44:15.353 --> 44:18.356
I think she was just
trying to prove a point.

44:18.389 --> 44:21.092
(June)
What point was she
trying to prove?

44:25.163 --> 44:26.765
Same point she was
trying to prove

44:26.798 --> 44:30.702
every time
she had a baby.

44:30.736 --> 44:33.438
This was just
another baby.

45:27.192 --> 45:30.428
* There's a land that I see

45:30.461 --> 45:33.899
* Where the children
are free *

45:33.932 --> 45:36.902
* And I say it ain't far

45:36.935 --> 45:39.938
* To this land
from where we are *

45:39.971 --> 45:43.008
* Take my hand
come with me *

45:43.041 --> 45:46.144
* Where the children are free

45:46.177 --> 45:49.347
* Come with me
take my hand *

45:49.380 --> 45:52.283
* And we'll live

45:52.317 --> 45:55.286
* In a land where the
river runs free *

45:55.320 --> 45:58.556
* In a land through
the green country *

45:58.589 --> 46:01.292
* In a land to a shining sea

46:01.326 --> 46:04.963
* And you and me
are free to be *

46:04.996 --> 46:07.332
* You and me

46:10.936 --> 46:14.239
* Every boy in this land

46:14.272 --> 46:17.208
* Grows to be
his own man *

46:17.242 --> 46:20.278
* In this land
every girl *

46:20.311 --> 46:23.414
* Grows to be her own woman

46:23.448 --> 46:26.818
* Take my hand
come with me *

46:26.852 --> 46:29.888
* Where the children are free

46:29.921 --> 46:32.924
* Come with me
take my hand *

46:32.958 --> 46:36.027
* And we'll run

46:36.061 --> 46:39.064
* To a land where the
river runs free *

46:39.097 --> 46:41.833
* To a land through
the green country *

46:41.867 --> 46:44.970
* To a land to a shining sea

46:45.003 --> 46:47.973
* To a land where
the horses run free *

46:48.006 --> 46:51.042
* To a land where the
children are free *

46:51.076 --> 46:54.145
* And you and me
are free to be *

46:54.179 --> 46:57.282
* And you and me are
free to be *

46:57.315 --> 47:00.919
* And you and me
are free to be *

47:00.952 --> 47:05.023
* You and me.

47:22.473 --> 47:26.444
(Isa singing)

48:01.079 --> 48:05.216
(singing continues)

48:30.275 --> 48:32.110
That's pretty.

48:33.611 --> 48:36.014
Where'd you learn
that song?

48:36.047 --> 48:39.084
Mmm, I just keep
dreaming about it.

48:39.117 --> 48:41.052
(June)
You dreamt that?

48:41.086 --> 48:43.221
What language is it?

48:45.290 --> 48:47.492
I don't know.

48:47.525 --> 48:50.761
I just woke up
knowing those words.

48:54.632 --> 48:57.702
I just keep thinking
about Mom.

49:00.005 --> 49:02.507
If she's still
down there somewhere.

49:09.247 --> 49:13.151
I know that they did everything
that they could, but...

49:15.286 --> 49:17.188
I can't help feeling that
if we went down there,

49:17.222 --> 49:19.524
we would be able
to find her.

49:28.766 --> 49:31.169
Josh and I were talking today

49:31.202 --> 49:33.204
about, um, the plans
for the house,

49:33.238 --> 49:37.775
and he's really been
helping me, like, solidify them.

49:37.808 --> 49:40.611
And, I spoke to my dad.

49:40.645 --> 49:44.449
Um... I think he's
really on board.

49:44.482 --> 49:46.751
He just mentioned that I
need a business proposal

49:46.784 --> 49:50.221
just to make it really
official, and like...

49:50.255 --> 49:53.058
just like the structure.
Right.

49:53.091 --> 49:55.226
I thought you might be
really good at that.

49:55.260 --> 49:57.595
I am really good at that.
I had a feeling.

49:57.628 --> 50:00.665
Um, yes, I can absolutely
help you with that.

50:00.698 --> 50:02.167
Thank you.

50:02.200 --> 50:05.203
If you kind of draft
out all of your ideas,

50:05.236 --> 50:06.771
all of the thoughts that
you've been having

50:06.804 --> 50:10.241
for this commune thing,

50:10.275 --> 50:13.478
then I will help put it
into some structure

50:13.511 --> 50:15.213
and we can do a
formal business plan.

50:15.246 --> 50:16.481
Thank you.
I wouldn't say a
commune around here.

50:16.514 --> 50:19.117
I wouldn't use that word,
'cause I think that

50:19.150 --> 50:22.087
you might get into a
little bit of hot water.

50:22.120 --> 50:24.222
But it's more
like a...

50:24.255 --> 50:27.158
Like a...
Like a school, or uh...

50:27.192 --> 50:30.195
Or like a place for people
to practice what they do.

50:30.228 --> 50:32.597
Like, I think that's missing
from so many people's life.

50:32.630 --> 50:35.633
It's just like space.
You know, just like a space.

50:35.666 --> 50:37.468
(laughs)
Shut up!

50:37.502 --> 50:39.104
I'm serious though.
(laughing)
Sorry.

50:39.137 --> 50:40.571
No, but I'm
super serious.

50:40.605 --> 50:41.739
I love...
You're so sweet.

50:41.772 --> 50:43.508
But it's true.
No, but it's true.

50:43.541 --> 50:46.277
Into the unknown, but this
might be amazing for you,

50:46.311 --> 50:47.845
is that we'd turn our bedroom

50:47.878 --> 50:51.282
into like a video
editing facility.

50:51.316 --> 50:52.683
(June)
Yeah, that would be great.

50:52.717 --> 50:54.085
And you could come
during the summer.

50:54.119 --> 50:55.153
Mm-hmm.
And it's yours.

50:55.186 --> 50:56.721
Yeah.
You know?

50:56.754 --> 50:59.224
And, um, well,
but I also thought,

50:59.257 --> 51:02.727
like, make the sunroom
like a painter's studio.

51:02.760 --> 51:04.162
Mm-hmm.
You know, you have the light.

51:04.195 --> 51:05.696
You have the view...
Why is that funny?

51:05.730 --> 51:08.533
(laughing) I don't know.
It's a great idea.

51:08.566 --> 51:10.268
We really could.

51:10.301 --> 51:12.637
Like, we have a
little bit of land.

51:12.670 --> 51:14.405
We could even
grow things.

51:14.439 --> 51:16.474
It's just, like, it's just...
(laughing)
A compost.

51:16.507 --> 51:19.344
We could be totally
self-sufficient.
Oh, my God, she's dying.

51:19.377 --> 51:20.878
(laughing)

51:20.911 --> 51:22.780
It could be completely
self-sufficient.

51:22.813 --> 51:24.782
Wait, are you, like,
into this or not?

51:24.815 --> 51:28.186
I can't tell.
I think she's...

51:28.219 --> 51:31.189
I love that
she's so into it.

51:31.222 --> 51:32.423
See, I knew
you would win.

51:32.457 --> 51:33.591
I love it.

51:33.624 --> 51:35.526
(laughing)

51:39.297 --> 51:41.866
(June)
It's great.
Let's do it.

51:41.899 --> 51:43.901
Let's do it.
Why not?

51:43.934 --> 51:46.671
You should name it
after your mom.

51:46.704 --> 51:48.706
That's a really
beautiful...

51:48.739 --> 51:52.643
The Amelia Brooks
Art Institute.

51:52.677 --> 51:54.912
(all)
Institute.

51:54.945 --> 51:56.814
(June)
Cheers.

52:05.790 --> 52:07.792
(chuckles)

52:07.825 --> 52:09.527
Look.

52:13.864 --> 52:16.901
What do you think, June?

52:16.934 --> 52:19.270
(June)
Looks good.

52:19.304 --> 52:22.707
Oh, God.

52:22.740 --> 52:25.610
(Annie)
Isa! Isa!

52:25.643 --> 52:29.647
Isa! Isa! Isa!
Isa! Isa!

52:29.680 --> 52:32.383
(cheering, laughing)

52:32.417 --> 52:33.684
(June)
Those shorts.
Those shorts.

52:33.718 --> 52:35.220
Do you remember?

52:35.253 --> 52:37.522
She wore them all the time.
Come on, every day.

52:37.555 --> 52:38.656
Oh, Mom?

52:38.689 --> 52:40.358
Justice for our lake.

52:40.391 --> 52:43.728
Justice for our lake.
Justice for our lake.

52:43.761 --> 52:45.463
Justice for our lake.

52:45.496 --> 52:49.234
(all)
No, no, we won't go!
No, no, we won't go!

52:49.267 --> 52:50.601
No, no...
(laughter)

52:50.635 --> 52:54.339
Please. Please.
Please. Please.

52:57.007 --> 52:58.843
(Isa)
You can do it.

52:58.876 --> 53:02.280
(sighs deeply)

53:03.414 --> 53:06.551
You look just like Mom.
You know that?

53:06.584 --> 53:07.918
(Isa and June)
Annie!

53:07.952 --> 53:12.457
Annie! Annie!
Annie! Annie!

53:12.490 --> 53:14.659
(singing)
The...

53:14.692 --> 53:18.663
moon is shining.

53:18.696 --> 53:23.434
(other girls singing along)
The stars are sparkling.

53:23.468 --> 53:27.538
The lake fairies
are here

53:27.572 --> 53:32.410
to bring you to bed.

53:33.311 --> 53:36.714
Where are
my babies?

53:36.747 --> 53:41.386
My sweet little babies?

53:41.419 --> 53:44.389
Mama is here...

53:44.422 --> 53:48.859
(all girls)
to bring you to bed.

53:50.495 --> 53:52.497
Who's ready for bed?

53:52.530 --> 53:55.900
Are all my little girls
ready for bed?

53:55.933 --> 53:58.436
Mama's here
to tuck you in.

54:00.805 --> 54:02.973
Annie?

54:03.007 --> 54:05.576
Why aren't the girls
ready for bed?

54:07.412 --> 54:09.347
I asked you over a
half an hour ago to get them

54:09.380 --> 54:11.682
into their pajamas and
to brush their teeth,

54:11.716 --> 54:12.817
and nothing has happened.

54:12.850 --> 54:14.885
Why aren't they
ready for bed?

54:16.687 --> 54:18.789
You never listen to me.

54:21.025 --> 54:23.861
Do you have no respect
for your mother?

54:23.894 --> 54:26.063
You're such a
little daddy's girl.

54:26.096 --> 54:28.399
That's the only person
that you'll listen to.

54:28.433 --> 54:31.936
I asked you to help
with your sisters.

54:31.969 --> 54:34.372
Must I do it
all on my own?

54:34.405 --> 54:37.041
I have to do everything
all on my own.

54:37.074 --> 54:39.710
The only person who loves me
in this whole house is the dog.

54:39.744 --> 54:41.979
Do you want me to
just sleep with the dog?
Is that what I should do?

54:42.012 --> 54:44.482
I should just go and
sleep with the dog.

54:44.515 --> 54:47.785
You're a selfish little brat.
You're a selfish little brat!

54:47.818 --> 54:49.954
All I wanted was a
little bit of help.

54:51.456 --> 54:54.859
All I wanted was
a little bit of help.

54:54.892 --> 54:56.927
Is that too much to ask?

54:56.961 --> 54:59.797
I have to get up
early in the morning.

54:59.830 --> 55:02.567
(laughing)

55:04.935 --> 55:07.838
Let me go again.
Let me go again.

55:15.112 --> 55:17.682
I'm gonna go again and
I'm just gonna do the song.

55:17.715 --> 55:19.684
Okay, I'm just
gonna do the song.

55:19.717 --> 55:21.686
(girls crying, sniffling)

55:21.719 --> 55:23.588
Okay?

55:28.693 --> 55:30.428
(laughs)

55:32.129 --> 55:35.466
(singing)
The moon is shining.

55:37.668 --> 55:41.005
The stars are sparkling.

55:41.038 --> 55:46.844
The lake fairies are here
to bring you to bed.

55:47.745 --> 55:51.048
Where are my babies?

55:53.651 --> 55:57.988
My sweet little babies?

55:58.022 --> 56:04.529
'Cause Mama is here
to bring you to bed.

56:19.544 --> 56:24.114
Don't forget
to breathe, Junebug.

56:24.148 --> 56:27.485
(inhales deeply)

56:27.518 --> 56:29.987
(exhaling)

56:34.859 --> 56:37.462
There, that's better.

57:12.830 --> 57:14.565
(June whispering)
Hey.

57:17.267 --> 57:18.769
Get up.

57:18.803 --> 57:21.205
I have to show
you something.

57:40.525 --> 57:42.259
(Annie)
That's beautiful, June.

57:42.292 --> 57:44.895
(June)
Yeah, it is very beautiful,
but I didn't take it.

57:44.929 --> 57:47.632
That's what I wanted
to ask you guys about.

57:47.665 --> 57:49.834
I mean, we didn't
take it.

57:52.002 --> 57:53.704
You think
we took it?

57:53.738 --> 57:55.773
Well, I didn't
take it.

57:55.806 --> 57:58.242
So, somebody else did.

57:58.275 --> 58:00.077
I woke up this morning and
this footage was on my camera

58:00.110 --> 58:02.880
and I didn't take it.

58:02.913 --> 58:04.281
You sure you didn't
take it a couple days ago

58:04.314 --> 58:05.750
and you just didn't
check the footage?

58:05.783 --> 58:07.952
Yes. I'm sure.

58:07.985 --> 58:10.287
You guys were sleeping on
the couch and I left
my camera down here.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.723
I really actually
don't care if you did,
I just want to know.

58:12.757 --> 58:14.892
Yeah, but first of all,
I wouldn't touch your
camera, and I didn't do this.

58:14.925 --> 58:16.694
Yeah, I wouldn't touch
your camera either.

58:16.727 --> 58:18.228
Just, it's not funny anymore,
I'm getting really freaked out.

58:18.262 --> 58:19.797
But I'm not trying to
play a joke on you,

58:19.830 --> 58:21.131
I just didn't
touch your camera.

58:21.165 --> 58:23.901
(Annie)
All right, this is
getting really weird.

58:25.870 --> 58:27.204
What?

58:29.039 --> 58:33.544
I found another bird
this morning.

58:33.578 --> 58:35.112
(Josh)
I told you already
about the birds,

58:35.145 --> 58:36.914
it's just the time
of the year, it's not...

58:36.947 --> 58:38.115
(Annie)
I would be able
to believe that

58:38.148 --> 58:39.850
if it was just one,
but every single day.

58:39.884 --> 58:41.251
I know, but it's
this time of year...

58:41.285 --> 58:43.253
Isa, do you promise me?

58:43.287 --> 58:45.923
June, I swear, I didn't
touch your camera.

58:45.956 --> 58:47.558
I wouldn't do anything
like that to you.

58:47.592 --> 58:49.259
I really, really, don't care
if you did, but I...

58:49.293 --> 58:51.729
But I didn't, you just have
to believe that I didn't.

58:51.762 --> 58:54.599
I don't like getting
blamed for it.

58:54.632 --> 58:56.333
(Annie)
I think we should
call the police.

58:56.366 --> 58:57.635
Me too.

58:57.668 --> 58:59.003
What are you gonna
tell the police?

58:59.036 --> 59:00.204
We need to report
that somebody broke

59:00.237 --> 59:02.006
into the house and
stole her camera.

59:02.039 --> 59:04.008
Okay, somebody broke
into the house, they
stole the camera,

59:04.041 --> 59:05.743
they went out to
the dock, and then
they filmed some stuff...

59:05.776 --> 59:07.177
Something really
weird is going on...
and then they came back in,

59:07.211 --> 59:09.847
and then they just decided
to leave the camera,

59:09.880 --> 59:12.182
and put it back.
Yeah, that's a
crime isn't it?

59:12.216 --> 59:14.819
I mean, do you think Mom
could be doing this?

59:14.852 --> 59:16.220
Mom had nothing
to do with this.

59:16.253 --> 59:17.187
Jesus, come on.

59:17.221 --> 59:20.024
Why are you laughing at me?
It's not funny.

59:20.057 --> 59:21.992
Okay, June your mom
came back from the dead,

59:22.026 --> 59:23.694
and she knows how
to use the camera.
Okay, that's enough.

59:23.728 --> 59:25.663
She went down to
the lake, she did a
time lapse just for fun.

59:25.696 --> 59:27.665
That's enough.
And then she put it back
for you just to kinda find.

59:27.698 --> 59:28.733
Hey!

59:28.766 --> 59:31.368
I mean,
you guys gotta...

59:31.401 --> 59:32.670
Really.

59:32.703 --> 59:35.372
(Annie)
Let's just leave it.

59:35.405 --> 59:38.709
All right.

59:38.743 --> 59:43.147
I just have this really
bad feeling that...

59:45.249 --> 59:47.785
that night that
we went out

59:47.818 --> 59:49.620
and we summoned
the seventh sister,

59:49.654 --> 59:52.356
that we, like, opened
some kind of door that
we shouldn't have.

59:52.389 --> 59:53.390
(Annie)
No.

59:53.423 --> 59:55.693
(Josh)
No, it's a tale.

59:55.726 --> 59:58.295
That's all
it is, okay?

59:58.328 --> 59:59.964
Hey, you know what?

59:59.997 --> 01:00:01.265
Let's go see
Maggie Holmes.

01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:02.667
She's lived here forever.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.368
She knows all about
the folklore.

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:06.837
You can ask her about
the seven sisters, okay?

01:00:06.871 --> 01:00:08.639
If that'll make
you feel better.

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:12.276
(Maggie)
In the olden days,

01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:15.145
the period costumes were
so heavy and so layered,

01:00:15.179 --> 01:00:19.316
pantaloons and petticoats
on top of one another.

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:22.887
And this particular family
was very conservative

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.389
and they didn't
want their seven girls

01:00:25.422 --> 01:00:27.357
to disrobe and swim.

01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:31.996
And this one night
it was so sweltering hot

01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:34.398
that they snuck out at midnight,

01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:38.268
took off their clothes
and went for a swim.

01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:43.140
The first sister
went in and didn't emerge.

01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:47.878
And the second one followed,
and didn't emerge.

01:00:49.046 --> 01:00:52.016
And the third
and fourth.

01:00:52.049 --> 01:00:54.151
All seven went in.

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:56.954
Do you think that
if you summon

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:59.089
the seventh sister,
then she'll pull you under

01:00:59.123 --> 01:01:02.760
next time you swim?

01:01:02.793 --> 01:01:05.129
You know, I don't
know about that.

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:10.067
I know that I had

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:13.738
a very odd experience
many years ago.

01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:17.842
I went into the
water off the dock,

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:20.878
and I dove down.

01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:24.915
And suddenly, I saw
this tiny light...

01:01:24.949 --> 01:01:27.752
A very bright light.

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:30.254
It was simply
beautiful,

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:35.059
and I felt this
pull toward it,

01:01:35.092 --> 01:01:37.795
'til, all of a sudden,

01:01:37.828 --> 01:01:39.897
it wasn't a
comfortable pull.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:45.169
I felt that I had no power
to stop from going down.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:49.139
So, I fought to turn
myself around as...

01:01:49.173 --> 01:01:51.776
It was if I was
fighting a current...

01:01:51.809 --> 01:01:54.178
And with all my strength,

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:57.514
I rose to the top
of the water.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:02:00.250
And I remember
gasping for breath.

01:02:00.284 --> 01:02:05.155
And as I approached
the ladder,

01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:10.861
this overwhelming
sense came to me

01:02:10.895 --> 01:02:13.530
that I should
go back or look back.

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:17.167
But it was a very great
sense of loss

01:02:17.201 --> 01:02:20.504
that I have
even to this day,

01:02:20.537 --> 01:02:26.043
that... I left something
down there.

01:02:29.546 --> 01:02:33.417
So, you girls...

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:39.489
you dear girls,
you take good care, please.

01:02:39.523 --> 01:02:41.892
Just use wisdom.

01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:46.463
(Josh)
If you want,
you can stay with me,

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:48.198
if it'll make it easier.

01:02:50.167 --> 01:02:52.202
Make you feel better.

01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.476
Yeah, I don't know.

01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:07.084
Are you guys actually...

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:09.319
Are you still thinking
about selling the house?

01:03:09.353 --> 01:03:11.021
Mm-hmm.

01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:18.362
I thought you said
you wanted to stay.

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:29.940
I don't know.

01:03:34.011 --> 01:03:36.180
June, can you
just back off?

01:03:36.213 --> 01:03:38.949
You know what? Let's go
somewhere and talk.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:38.368
(breathes deeply)

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:51.015
(splash)

01:05:51.048 --> 01:05:53.517
(breathing through mask)

01:06:31.555 --> 01:06:34.224
(faint singing)

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:41.498
(echoing scream)

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:44.201
(panicked breathing)

01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:56.113
(panicked breathing
intensifies)

01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:19.803
(panicked breathing
subsides)

01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:52.302
(June humming)

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:58.842
(humming continues)

01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:07.751
(Isa)
Yeah.

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:10.620
That's the same one
from my dream.

01:08:10.654 --> 01:08:13.290
I thought so.

01:08:13.323 --> 01:08:15.392
Do you still
dream it?

01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:20.229
No, it stopped.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:24.501
And...

01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:29.273
I'm kind of relieved
'cause...

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:38.848
there was always something that
felt like it was calling me...

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:43.819
to somewhere...
something dangerous.

01:08:47.424 --> 01:08:50.327
June, don't go swimming
in the lake.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.229
Why not?

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:56.399
(knocking)

01:08:56.433 --> 01:08:57.801
Yeah?

01:08:57.834 --> 01:08:59.435
Hi.
Hi.

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:00.804
Can I sleep with
you guys tonight?

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:02.406
I don't wanna be alone.

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:05.242
Yeah, of course.

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:06.475
You okay?

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:08.278
Yeah.

01:09:08.312 --> 01:09:10.314
I felt like
such a little kid.

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:13.383
You know, just every
little noise that I heard

01:09:13.417 --> 01:09:17.321
was making me feel
so freaked out,

01:09:17.354 --> 01:09:19.389
and I started
holding my breath in bed,

01:09:19.423 --> 01:09:23.827
and I swear I heard
a baby crying.

01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:33.303
Is it my mind
playing tricks on me?

01:09:33.337 --> 01:09:36.773
(Isa)
I think something
is telling us to go.

01:10:13.277 --> 01:10:15.445
(June)
It's really weird... it's
almost exactly the same

01:10:15.479 --> 01:10:17.547
as the other one, but
it's a little bit closer

01:10:17.581 --> 01:10:19.549
this time, I think.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.722
What is that?

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:27.257
Do you see that?
Yeah.

01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:28.792
What?
I don't know.

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:31.561
I saw something flash
by the... right here.

01:10:31.595 --> 01:10:34.531
Oh!
Whoa.

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.266
I totally missed that.

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:39.469
(Isa)
Oh, my God, it's the
seventh sister.

01:10:39.503 --> 01:10:42.539
Isn't that you?

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:44.040
That's you, June.

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.510
That's impossible,
I didn't take this.

01:10:46.543 --> 01:10:49.446
Something really, really
weird is going on.

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:54.784
Okay, I need you to put down
the camera for a little while.

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.021
Why?

01:10:58.054 --> 01:10:59.556
Let's just talk
about this, okay?

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:00.724
We should talk.

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:03.393
We can talk about it
with the camera.

01:11:03.427 --> 01:11:05.829
Put it down, June.
You guys,
I didn't take that.

01:11:05.862 --> 01:11:07.731
She's not asking, June.
Put the camera down.

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:09.999
I'm not gonna put
the camera down.

01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:16.340
(sniffling)

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:19.609
Take a deep breath, June.
(scoffs)

01:11:19.643 --> 01:11:22.446
Take a deep breath.

01:11:22.479 --> 01:11:23.980
It's okay.

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:27.551
We're so proud of
you for... for...

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:28.918
how far you've come

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:30.487
and how well
you've been doing,

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:33.056
and we just don't wanna
see you revert back.

01:11:33.089 --> 01:11:36.726
And I think that
being home is just...

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.863
It's too hard.
It's too hard for you.

01:11:39.896 --> 01:11:42.466
It's... it's too hard
for all of us.

01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:44.834
But I'm doing
really well.

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:49.072
(Isa)
I went into your closet

01:11:49.105 --> 01:11:51.875
and I noticed that you
have the shawl.

01:11:51.908 --> 01:11:54.478
And I went to pick it up,

01:11:54.511 --> 01:11:58.382
and inside of it
I found a dead bird.

01:11:58.415 --> 01:12:01.385
We know that you've been
sneaking out at night,

01:12:01.418 --> 01:12:04.654
and you've been
leaving the birds...

01:12:04.688 --> 01:12:06.823
and the time lapses.

01:12:06.856 --> 01:12:09.493
(June sighs, sniffles)

01:12:11.461 --> 01:12:14.898
I think that we should all
go out onto the dock

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:17.934
and say our
goodbyes to Mom

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:20.003
and then we should go.

01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:25.008
But the camera's
not invited.

01:12:28.712 --> 01:12:31.347
(June continues crying,
sniffling)

01:12:40.824 --> 01:12:42.125
(door closing)

01:12:44.928 --> 01:12:46.996
(June)
You guys?

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:48.798
You guys?
(Annie)
What?

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:52.536
I'm sorry.
You guys were right.

01:12:52.569 --> 01:12:55.439
I... I didn't mean to do
any of this stuff.

01:12:55.472 --> 01:12:57.574
I didn't... I don't think
I even knew I was doing it,

01:12:57.607 --> 01:12:59.976
but I was just
so sad about Mom,

01:13:00.009 --> 01:13:02.579
and just so upset,
and I just...

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:04.914
(sniffling)
I'm sorry, I just got confused,

01:13:04.948 --> 01:13:06.650
and I was just dealing with
it in the wrong way.

01:13:06.683 --> 01:13:08.585
But I promise
I'll... I promise

01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:11.921
I won't do it
anymore, and I...

01:13:11.955 --> 01:13:13.823
(Annie)
We're not gonna
do this again.

01:13:13.857 --> 01:13:18.428
We've been down this road
before, and we're not
gonna do it again.

01:13:18.462 --> 01:13:20.664
(Isa)
We see that you're starting
to spiral out of control.

01:13:20.697 --> 01:13:21.965
I'm not spiraling
out of control.

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:23.433
And the doctors
have always told us

01:13:23.467 --> 01:13:25.735
that when we are with you,
we enable you.

01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:27.103
Oh, my God, I am not
out of control.

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:29.205
The doctors are idiots.
They don't know anything.

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:31.107
I'm sorry if you're too
scared to deal with it.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.109
I'm sorry if you're cowards,
but I'm your sister.

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:34.911
You listen to my
words right now.

01:13:34.944 --> 01:13:36.980
I'm not doing this
with you again.

01:13:37.013 --> 01:13:38.582
We're leaving
in three hours,

01:13:38.615 --> 01:13:40.116
and you can get in that
car and go home with us...

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:41.718
How can you talk
to me like that?

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:43.853
Or you stay.
It's your decision.
Look at me!

01:13:43.887 --> 01:13:44.988
It's your decision.

01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:48.625
What is wrong with you?

01:13:48.658 --> 01:13:51.761
What the hell is wrong
with you guys?

01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:53.863
I hate you so much!

01:13:53.897 --> 01:13:56.232
Ah, I hate
you guys!

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:58.502
(breathing deeply)

01:14:05.675 --> 01:14:08.144
(sniffling)

01:14:11.815 --> 01:14:14.618
(sighing)

01:14:30.567 --> 01:14:32.235
(whispering)
Mom.

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:48.585
Mom, do you believe me?

01:14:50.754 --> 01:14:52.622
Do you believe me?

01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:04.534
(sniffling)

01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:08.064
(splash)

01:17:31.214 --> 01:17:32.215
(record playing)

01:17:32.248 --> 01:17:36.019
* I see a land
bright and clear *

01:17:36.052 --> 01:17:39.689
* And the time's
coming near, when... *

01:17:39.723 --> 01:17:43.226
(song skips, starts over)

01:17:43.259 --> 01:17:46.930
* I see a land
bright and clear *

01:17:46.963 --> 01:17:50.199
* And the time's
coming near... *

01:17:50.233 --> 01:17:51.868
(door creaking)

01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:55.939
(rain falling, wind blowing)

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:05.014
(humming)

01:18:05.882 --> 01:18:10.119
(singing)

01:18:42.986 --> 01:18:46.122
I'll just read my
favorite passages.

01:18:51.527 --> 01:18:53.229
(man)
Which one?

01:18:56.032 --> 01:18:58.301
"Though inland far we be,"

01:18:58.334 --> 01:19:02.071
"our souls have sight
of that immortal sea"

01:19:02.105 --> 01:19:04.440
"which brought us hither."

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:11.781
"Our birth is but a sleep
and a forgetting."

01:19:11.815 --> 01:19:16.920
"The soul that rises
with us, our life's Star,"

01:19:16.953 --> 01:19:23.126
"hath had elsewhere its setting
and cometh from afar."

01:19:26.029 --> 01:19:29.165
"Not in entire
forgetfulness,

01:19:29.198 --> 01:19:33.336
"and not in
utter nakedness,

01:19:33.369 --> 01:19:37.006
but in trailing clouds
we come."

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:50.019
(door opening)

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:44.240
(bubbling)

01:20:46.009 --> 01:20:50.179
(breathing with mask)

01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:57.146
(faint singing)

01:22:01.084 --> 01:22:04.187
(singing becomes louder)

01:22:13.462 --> 01:22:15.965
(singing stops abruptly)

01:22:15.999 --> 01:22:18.467
(humming)

01:22:19.535 --> 01:22:23.006
(baby cooing)

01:22:28.411 --> 01:22:31.247
(people speaking in
native language throughout)

01:22:32.305 --> 01:22:38.371
