00:42.632 --> 00:44.801
[soft jazz music playing]

00:47.804 --> 00:50.556
Hello, Brandy. Are they here?

00:58.784 --> 01:02.453
_

01:07.156 --> 01:09.659
I've been so looking forward to this.

01:12.495 --> 01:15.665
- Me, too!
- So... the boys aren't here yet?

01:15.748 --> 01:17.667
Oh, boy, nothing gets by you.

01:20.044 --> 01:22.254
We won't be needing this anymore.

01:22.338 --> 01:25.675
Wait! What do you use
to sop up sauce with?

01:25.758 --> 01:28.135
I don't eat sauce.

01:28.218 --> 01:31.305
I'd like a vodka martini, straight up.
Very dry, please.

01:31.388 --> 01:33.724
And two olives on the side.
Thank you.

01:33.808 --> 01:35.893
You do know that vodka
is made from potatoes.

01:35.977 --> 01:37.770
Alcohol has its own rules.

01:39.438 --> 01:40.690
So...

01:43.275 --> 01:45.069
So... [chuckles]

01:45.152 --> 01:48.572
What do you think is so important
that we had to have dinner tonight?

01:48.656 --> 01:50.324
I'm getting something.

01:50.407 --> 01:55.371
I have a very strong sense that this is
the night they announce their retirement.

01:55.454 --> 01:58.708
I've been wondering the same thing.
Of course, I'm not psychic.

01:58.791 --> 02:01.168
Oh, honey, you don't know that.

02:01.251 --> 02:03.880
No. I do. Because no one is.

02:03.963 --> 02:07.299
- Well, I hope they do.
- Me, too.

02:07.383 --> 02:10.301
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

02:10.386 --> 02:11.387
Hi, sweetheart.

02:11.470 --> 02:13.597
[whispers] No appetizers, no dessert.

02:15.182 --> 02:16.183
How are you?

02:16.266 --> 02:17.894
- Hello, Grace.
- Hello, Sol.

02:23.649 --> 02:28.071
These mussels are delicious.
And the crab. So fresh.

02:28.153 --> 02:30.614
And they give you three sauces!

02:30.698 --> 02:32.449
Look at this oyster!

02:32.533 --> 02:35.452
Do you think they realize
they live in their own spoon?

02:35.536 --> 02:38.414
We've only had this
seafood platter 700 times.

02:38.497 --> 02:41.959
- Sol's a little anxious tonight.
- Something happen at the office?

02:42.043 --> 02:46.380
Actually, we do want to talk
to you two about something.

02:46.463 --> 02:48.883
- Right, Sol?
- Okay.

02:51.594 --> 02:54.430
Well, um...

02:57.767 --> 03:01.270
As you know,
we're getting better with age.

03:01.353 --> 03:07.317
And this can be a very exciting
chapter we're about to open.

03:07.401 --> 03:09.695
In the book of life.

03:09.779 --> 03:12.656
It feels alive with possibility.

03:12.740 --> 03:14.658
And change.

03:14.742 --> 03:20.039
And Frankie herself
says change is always good.

03:20.123 --> 03:23.709
Especially when starting
this new chapter of our lives.

03:23.793 --> 03:26.670
This new chapter of our lives is gonna be
over if you don't get to the point.

03:26.754 --> 03:28.422
- I'll do it.
- No.

03:28.505 --> 03:29.632
- It's okay.
- Robert...

03:29.715 --> 03:30.800
Please, Sol.

03:30.883 --> 03:33.552
What Sol is trying to say is...

03:35.096 --> 03:36.472
I'm leaving you.

03:39.142 --> 03:40.476
And he's leaving you...

03:43.104 --> 03:47.984
For this...
next chapter of our lives.

03:49.485 --> 03:51.570
- You're leaving me?
- Yes.

03:54.281 --> 03:56.867
- Who is she?
- Oh, it's not what you think.

03:56.951 --> 03:59.453
- It's a he.
- Excuse me?

03:59.536 --> 04:03.082
And it's Sol.
I'm in love with Sol.

04:03.166 --> 04:04.458
Sol and I are in love.

04:05.459 --> 04:07.878
- My Sol?
- Your Sol.

04:08.754 --> 04:12.008
You mean you're gay?
And this is who you're gay with?

04:12.091 --> 04:14.468
- This is who I'm in love with.
- Oh, my God.

04:14.551 --> 04:16.720
No. This makes no sense.

04:16.803 --> 04:19.807
You're business partners,
you're not lovers... friends.

04:22.267 --> 04:24.020
How long has this been going on?

04:24.103 --> 04:25.354
Well, it's been...

04:25.437 --> 04:27.648
- I don't know exactly.
- Twenty years.

04:27.731 --> 04:29.316
- [Grace gasps]
- Think there was a better time

04:29.399 --> 04:32.903
to tell us this? Like, say, any time
over the last two decades?

04:32.987 --> 04:34.530
I'm gonna throw up.

04:34.613 --> 04:36.448
- [Sol] I'm so sorry.
- Why now?

04:36.532 --> 04:39.326
- We want to get married.
- Married?!

04:39.409 --> 04:42.788
- 'Cause we can do that now.
- I know! I hosted that fundraiser!

04:42.872 --> 04:46.125
Oh, my God.
This is why you brought us here!

04:46.209 --> 04:48.711
You didn't want me to make a scene,
did you, Robert?

04:48.794 --> 04:51.630
You thought this place would protect you.

04:51.714 --> 04:55.384
You spineless... chickensh--!

04:55.467 --> 04:57.469
- Don't do that!
- Sorry. Are people looking?

04:57.553 --> 04:59.889
- You want a scene? I'll give you a scene!
- No.

04:59.972 --> 05:02.641
- Actually, I didn't want a scene.
- You son of a bitch!

05:02.725 --> 05:04.977
- I can't believe this is happening.
- Breathe.

05:05.769 --> 05:08.772
Breathe. In two, three...

05:09.648 --> 05:11.608
Take your fucking hand off my sternum!

05:11.692 --> 05:13.360
- [Grace grunting]
- [Robert] Please!

05:20.450 --> 05:21.451
Grace.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.581
I, um...

05:30.460 --> 05:32.046
[scoffs]

05:32.129 --> 05:33.630
Of course.

05:40.596 --> 05:44.725
I'm sorry, Frankie.
I... didn't know how to handle it.

05:44.808 --> 05:47.144
Well, good job picking
the worst way imaginable.

05:47.228 --> 05:49.188
Some things there's no good way to do.

05:49.272 --> 05:53.067
How do I tell the woman I've loved
for 40 years that I can't be with her

05:53.150 --> 05:55.152
- if I want to be happy.
- You don't.

05:55.236 --> 05:58.614
Ride out the clock.
Stay miserable. I've got news for you.

05:58.697 --> 06:01.408
The next chapter is not that long.

06:01.491 --> 06:06.330
- Wait, is that why you got the Cialis?
- Everyone gets Cialis at my age.

06:07.539 --> 06:10.334
You probably should sleep in the den.

06:42.866 --> 06:44.243
[sighs]

06:45.369 --> 06:47.330
[knock on door]

06:52.168 --> 06:53.502
Grace?

06:55.921 --> 06:57.756
Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

06:57.840 --> 07:01.969
I don't know.
Not talking is your forte.

07:02.052 --> 07:05.389
Well, I'm talking now, and I'm sorry.

07:05.472 --> 07:08.309
I just never thought
you'd be this upset.

07:09.977 --> 07:11.979
What did you think I'd be?

07:12.062 --> 07:14.857
I honestly thought you'd be relieved.

07:14.940 --> 07:18.235
Relieved? Really?!

07:19.028 --> 07:21.571
I think relief is what you're feeling.

07:21.655 --> 07:24.700
I'm feeling like
the last 40 years have been a fraud.

07:24.783 --> 07:29.746
Now, come on.
Only the last 20 years were a fraud.

07:29.830 --> 07:31.957
That's a joke.

07:32.041 --> 07:34.418
Uh-uh. No.
You don't get to do that.

07:34.501 --> 07:38.088
You don't get to pretend
that this is nothing.

07:38.172 --> 07:40.341
No. You're right. It is not nothing.

07:40.424 --> 07:43.219
And I should have told you
a long time ago.

07:43.302 --> 07:44.594
But let's be honest.

07:44.678 --> 07:47.764
Were you ever
really happy with me?

07:54.271 --> 07:56.357
I was happy enough.

07:57.524 --> 08:00.110
So we didn't have
the romance of the century.

08:00.194 --> 08:02.988
But I thought we were normal.

08:03.906 --> 08:08.535
I thought we were like everybody else.
I thought this was life.

08:11.747 --> 08:13.749
And I thought there was more.

08:15.792 --> 08:16.835
Hm.

08:18.587 --> 08:20.547
It would have been easier if you'd died.

08:26.887 --> 08:28.805
[groans softly]

08:45.864 --> 08:48.700
I can't remember the last time
I've slept without you.

08:50.953 --> 08:54.248
I know I've done it but I...
I can't remember.

08:58.294 --> 08:59.503
Come here.

09:14.559 --> 09:16.686
I hate that I hurt you.

09:16.770 --> 09:18.981
I really do love you.

09:27.906 --> 09:30.575
I mean,
you've always loved me for...

09:30.659 --> 09:33.203
Who you are.

09:33.287 --> 09:35.498
Ironic, isn't it?

09:48.635 --> 09:51.555
- [Sol] Hey, boys.
- [man] Hey, Dad.

09:51.638 --> 09:53.265
Mom.

09:53.349 --> 09:55.392
- [Sol] We need to talk.
- [man 2] Oh, my God.

09:55.476 --> 09:57.269
Is this another intervention?

09:57.353 --> 09:59.771
Dad, I'm 90 days clean, I swear.

09:59.855 --> 10:03.359
I took an Advil PM last night,
but I took that as directed.

10:03.442 --> 10:05.361
This is not an intervention.

10:05.444 --> 10:07.612
But you may want to make sure
your sponsor is available,

10:07.696 --> 10:10.740
'cause this will kick you in the balls.

10:15.704 --> 10:17.622
[knock on door]

10:20.667 --> 10:22.586
Grace, I'm going to cancel the kids.

10:22.669 --> 10:23.879
[Grace] No.

10:25.506 --> 10:27.383
They'll know something's up.

10:28.425 --> 10:31.220
I'm not ready
to talk to them yet about this.

10:31.303 --> 10:32.637
Are you sure?

10:32.721 --> 10:34.014
Yes.

10:36.225 --> 10:39.186
Try to be straight
for one more brunch.

10:44.358 --> 10:45.484
You're gay?

10:45.568 --> 10:48.195
Uncle Robert's gay?

10:49.363 --> 10:52.741
I mean, you've always
had a big personality,

10:52.824 --> 10:55.494
but I... I never thought...

10:55.578 --> 10:56.786
You and Uncle Robert?

10:56.870 --> 10:58.581
I don't see it.

10:59.998 --> 11:02.709
Oh, God, now I see it.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.587
Mom, I can't stop seeing it.

11:04.669 --> 11:06.713
I'm sorry.
Why don't we have a therapist here?

11:06.796 --> 11:10.217
- There was one here when the dog died.
- Oh, wait. There's more. Tell them.

11:10.300 --> 11:14.388
- Haven't we had enough news for one day?
- They're getting married.

11:14.471 --> 11:16.765
'Cause they want to make the most
of their remaining years.

11:16.848 --> 11:18.475
But that's okay, I mean,

11:18.559 --> 11:22.521
I've always dreamed that I would spend
my remaining years alone.

11:24.481 --> 11:26.149
Hummus?

11:28.485 --> 11:30.613
[vehicle approaching]

11:30.695 --> 11:33.407
[car doors open and shut]

11:33.490 --> 11:35.367
[footsteps approaching]

11:35.451 --> 11:37.035
What the fuck...

11:37.119 --> 11:38.662
- Hi, girls...
- ...is going on?

11:38.745 --> 11:41.248
- Where are Mitch and the kids?
- Dad, you're gay?

11:41.331 --> 11:44.334
Bud called.
When were you planning on telling us?

11:44.418 --> 11:47.170
I just wanted one last normal brunch.

11:47.254 --> 11:49.465
Is someone gonna start
explaining what's going on?

11:49.548 --> 11:51.467
Ask your father.

11:51.550 --> 11:53.636
Dad?

11:53.718 --> 11:55.554
Well, girls...

11:55.638 --> 11:58.223
It... It...

11:58.307 --> 12:00.809
It kind of is what it is.

12:02.185 --> 12:05.564
- Great talk, Dad.
- Please, sit down.

12:12.988 --> 12:16.158
I mean, if I found out you were
being indicted, I would've said sure.

12:16.241 --> 12:18.368
But this?

12:18.452 --> 12:21.705
Oh, my God.
What am I gonna tell my kids?

12:21.788 --> 12:23.999
Why don't you start with,
"Do you know where poop comes from?"

12:24.082 --> 12:25.334
[Grace and Robert groan]

12:25.417 --> 12:28.003
How am I in trouble right now?
Sorry, Dad.

12:28.086 --> 12:31.131
Look, I'm sorry you had to find out
this way and I know it's a shock,

12:31.214 --> 12:36.428
- but... honestly, it was killing me.
- Oh, Mom...

12:36.512 --> 12:39.264
This is why I didn't want
to talk about it yet.

12:40.807 --> 12:42.934
I didn't want to fall apart
in front of you.

12:43.018 --> 12:46.896
It's okay, Mom.
It's a fall apart kind of a thing.

12:48.273 --> 12:52.944
Daddy, we'll come
talk to you in a little bit. Okay?

12:53.028 --> 12:54.446
- Please?
- Oh!

12:56.948 --> 12:58.659
[sobbing]

12:58.742 --> 13:02.162
Mom, we're gonna
get you through this. Okay?

13:02.245 --> 13:03.622
We're gonna find you people to talk to.

13:03.706 --> 13:06.124
People who understand
exactly what you're going through.

13:06.208 --> 13:10.086
There's a group for wives of husbands
who've turned gay in their seventies?

13:10.170 --> 13:12.297
Mom, we'll go to Palm Springs
for the weekend.

13:12.381 --> 13:14.341
Oh, there is definitely
a group there, Mom.

13:14.424 --> 13:17.469
We'll... We could play tennis
and we'll go to the movies and...

13:17.553 --> 13:20.263
I can't... I can't plan.

13:20.347 --> 13:22.725
I'm just trying
to keep my coffee down.

13:24.059 --> 13:25.769
Mom, what can we do for you?

13:26.811 --> 13:29.064
Nothing, nothing.

13:34.069 --> 13:36.112
How about a Valium?

13:38.407 --> 13:39.742
Okay.

13:40.534 --> 13:42.994
If anyone can deal with this,
Mom, it is you.

13:43.078 --> 13:44.954
You're always talking about a door closing

13:45.038 --> 13:47.082
or a window closing
or opening, something...

13:47.165 --> 13:48.875
the point is... you would say...

13:48.958 --> 13:51.545
The journey starts in the unknown.

13:51.628 --> 13:53.963
And there are butterflies
that come from cocoons...

13:54.047 --> 13:56.550
That's just shit you say.

13:57.342 --> 14:00.220
Mom, three months ago
his life was a total mess.

14:00.303 --> 14:03.640
No shit. What professor
scores coke off a student?

14:03.724 --> 14:05.517
And not even the one
he was sleeping with.

14:05.601 --> 14:07.561
Right. I was as low as you could get.

14:07.644 --> 14:10.439
- But look at me now.
- Yes, look at him.

14:11.189 --> 14:14.651
Goddammit, he's a substitute teacher.

14:14.735 --> 14:17.487
But I'm okay. Because of you.

14:18.530 --> 14:22.075
Coyote. Nwabudike.

14:22.158 --> 14:25.120
I have got to get out of here.

14:27.205 --> 14:29.750
- [whispering] Holy shit.
- What the fuck, dude?

14:33.920 --> 14:37.549
Thank you so very much, Ma'am.
And you have yourself a great day now.

14:37.633 --> 14:39.092
Fuck you.

14:42.137 --> 14:42.971
Wow.

15:08.997 --> 15:10.499
Your chair arrived.

15:10.582 --> 15:13.418
Oh, my God, they said
it was going to take six weeks.

15:13.502 --> 15:15.712
It took two days.
When does that happen?

15:19.048 --> 15:23.512
It's a joke. Between me and Sol.

15:23.595 --> 15:24.763
A private joke.

15:24.847 --> 15:26.431
Now you get a sense of humor?

15:39.444 --> 15:41.279
When did you get this piece?

15:44.991 --> 15:46.284
About a year ago.

16:07.681 --> 16:09.265
I gotta get out of this house.

16:09.349 --> 16:11.017
- Why don't I go?
- No.

16:12.686 --> 16:16.523
I've never really liked this house.
I'm gonna go to the beach.

16:17.691 --> 16:18.775
I have a question.

16:18.859 --> 16:22.237
When people ask me why we got
that house with Sol and Frankie,

16:22.320 --> 16:25.699
I tell them what you told me.
That it was a business decision, right?

16:25.782 --> 16:29.077
A once in a lifetime opportunity
we could only afford together.

16:30.913 --> 16:33.373
That's not why, is it?

16:34.999 --> 16:36.418
Yeah.

16:43.299 --> 16:47.596
If anybody is gonna sit
on Ryan Gosling's face, it's gonna be me!

17:17.291 --> 17:18.961
Excuse me.

17:19.042 --> 17:23.423
Have you ever wondered if Ben and Jerry
make more than ice cream together?

17:23.506 --> 17:25.340
What?

17:25.425 --> 17:28.470
Ben and Jerry.
Are they more than ice cream buddies?

17:29.429 --> 17:31.264
How the hell would I know?

17:32.641 --> 17:34.350
Oh, bitch!

17:43.610 --> 17:45.528
Excuse me.

17:45.612 --> 17:46.613
Is that you?

17:47.990 --> 17:49.741
It used to be.

17:52.661 --> 17:55.538
Oh! Well, hello there, you!

17:55.622 --> 17:58.249
Grace? It's me, Daphne!

17:58.333 --> 18:01.085
- Hi, Daphne! Gotta run.
- Grace!

18:03.087 --> 18:05.799
Give me one of those bottles,
things... The big one.

18:05.882 --> 18:07.342
Give me a big one.

18:09.011 --> 18:10.887
That's good. Listen, sir.

18:10.971 --> 18:14.307
What brand would you smoke
if your husband turned out to be gay?

18:16.434 --> 18:18.770
- Newports.
- For the last 20 years.

18:18.854 --> 18:21.230
- Luckies.
- I'll take those.

18:21.898 --> 18:24.651
Sol never let me smoke.
Imagine him...

18:24.734 --> 18:26.903
judging what I put into my...
I'm telling you,

18:26.987 --> 18:30.448
and the whole time...
you know, they were doing blowjobs.

18:31.491 --> 18:32.492
I hear ya.

18:32.575 --> 18:33.576
[sighs]

18:34.786 --> 18:36.746
I mean, I'm assuming.

18:49.009 --> 18:51.761
[coughs, groans]

19:11.489 --> 19:13.408
Oh, God...

19:23.085 --> 19:24.794
Oh, shit!

19:26.504 --> 19:31.384
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

19:46.900 --> 19:48.110
[exhales sharply, clears throat]

19:49.069 --> 19:50.194
Okay.

19:51.905 --> 19:52.989
[phone beeps]

19:53.907 --> 19:57.119
In a little while,
I will drink this tea,

19:57.201 --> 19:59.913
which I've made from
the peyote cactus.

19:59.996 --> 20:02.832
The peyote will propel me

20:02.916 --> 20:06.002
on a vision quest to find insight,

20:06.086 --> 20:09.672
tranquility and acceptance.

20:09.756 --> 20:13.009
A vision quest I had hoped to take

20:13.093 --> 20:16.262
with my soon-to-be ex-husband.

20:16.345 --> 20:18.347
But now I walk this path alone.

20:18.431 --> 20:23.145
I know not where this road leads,
but I know that I will return... changed.

20:23.227 --> 20:26.397
Because of this impending transformation,

20:26.481 --> 20:29.818
I've called my loved ones
to tell them goodbye.

20:29.901 --> 20:34.530
But no one was home, hence,
this recording.

20:34.614 --> 20:38.868
Apparently, the tea can be very bitter.

20:38.952 --> 20:41.913
But the Indians believed
that if your heart is pure,

20:41.997 --> 20:45.000
the bitterness will not be tasted.

20:50.172 --> 20:53.925
Oh. Holy shit, that's bad! Oh!

20:54.009 --> 20:55.677
My God.

20:57.470 --> 20:58.596
[sighs]

20:58.680 --> 21:02.475
Apparently,
I have some purification still to do.

21:03.309 --> 21:04.727
I will do it off camera.

21:05.478 --> 21:10.859
This is the old Frankie saying
goodbye to everyone.

21:15.446 --> 21:16.614
[beeps]

21:18.700 --> 21:21.036
[beeping]

21:21.119 --> 21:23.788
How the hell do you turn this thing off?

21:36.051 --> 21:38.469
[Frankie chanting ohms]

21:42.140 --> 21:43.141
Hm.

21:52.817 --> 21:57.488
[chanting continues]

22:03.203 --> 22:05.205
- What are you doing?
- [chanting stops]

22:06.330 --> 22:08.833
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing here?

22:08.917 --> 22:11.961
- You mean in my house?
- This is my house, too.

22:13.129 --> 22:15.048
Look, I don't want to hurt
your feelings,

22:15.131 --> 22:17.884
but when Robert told me
we were going in on this place together,

22:17.967 --> 22:21.554
I made him promise we would never
have to be here at the same time.

22:21.637 --> 22:25.975
Oh, really? Because I had Sol
actually write that into the contract.

22:26.059 --> 22:28.853
- No, you didn't.
- No, I didn't.

22:28.937 --> 22:31.564
But you hurt my feelings
so I lashed out.

22:31.647 --> 22:34.609
Please, please go somewhere else.

22:34.692 --> 22:37.862
I need to be here. People know me.

22:37.946 --> 22:40.990
- I can't deal with anybody right now.
- Well, I can't either.

22:41.074 --> 22:43.492
Oh, sure you can. People expect
this kind of thing from you.

22:43.576 --> 22:47.997
Oh, because I'm a tolerant person
I deserve to have my life blown apart?

22:48.081 --> 22:53.211
I didn't say "deserve."
I'm just saying... it's harder for me.

22:53.295 --> 22:56.380
You have no idea
what I'm going through.

22:56.464 --> 23:00.635
I lost my best friend.
You don't even like Robert.

23:01.928 --> 23:05.014
You have no right to judge me.

23:05.098 --> 23:06.557
You don't know us.

23:06.641 --> 23:08.935
[clears throat]

23:09.018 --> 23:14.357
I'm sorry, I was judging
by my experience of you,

23:14.482 --> 23:18.069
not the real you.
That was wrong of me.

23:18.153 --> 23:21.156
Thank you.
Now please just go.

23:21.239 --> 23:23.325
You know what?

23:23.407 --> 23:27.411
This is not the energy
I wanted to start my vision quest with.

23:27.495 --> 23:33.042
So I am gonna go.
But I will be back tomorrow.

23:33.126 --> 23:38.547
And, of course,
I will be a different person.

23:38.631 --> 23:42.969
Hopefully, the new me
will like you better.

23:45.305 --> 23:48.891
Goodbye.
To you and all I've ever known.

23:52.478 --> 23:54.189
There's ice cream in the fridge.

24:20.882 --> 24:23.218
[cell phone ringing]

24:23.301 --> 24:25.594
- Hello.
- Hello...

24:25.678 --> 24:30.558
So I get to the beach and
who do I find doing her yoga noises?

24:30.641 --> 24:33.561
- I'm guessing Frankie.
- They didn't have turkey.

24:33.644 --> 24:37.023
What was that? Is that Sol?

24:37.106 --> 24:40.818
No, no. I'm having a bite
in a noisy place.

24:40.902 --> 24:42.111
[inaudible]

24:42.653 --> 24:45.198
So, what's up, Grace?

24:45.281 --> 24:48.701
I want this house, Robert.
You owe me this.

24:48.784 --> 24:50.786
Consider it your gift to me.

24:50.870 --> 24:54.416
You know, the gift that says, "I've been
bonking my law partner for 20 years."

24:54.498 --> 24:57.668
Sorry. See, I thought the one upside
to this whole mess

24:57.752 --> 25:01.130
was that I'd never have to spend
another moment with this woman.

25:01.214 --> 25:03.132
I want this house!

25:03.216 --> 25:07.387
Okay. I'm not exactly sure what you want
me to do about it right now, Grace.

25:07.470 --> 25:09.513
I want you to be sure
this house is mine,

25:09.597 --> 25:13.809
because that's what I'm telling Frankie
when she gets back from her vision test.

25:18.481 --> 25:20.608
[both sigh]

25:22.610 --> 25:25.696
- Stop.
- What?

25:25.780 --> 25:29.117
- I know you. You're feeling guilty.
- Yes!

25:29.200 --> 25:31.494
I'm feeling extremely guilty.

25:31.577 --> 25:34.663
I devastated someone I love very much.

25:36.124 --> 25:38.293
And you know what makes it even worse?

25:38.376 --> 25:39.585
What?

25:39.668 --> 25:41.587
I'm so fucking happy!

25:41.670 --> 25:42.797
[chuckles]

25:42.880 --> 25:46.884
- Don't you feel... even a little guilty?
- No.

25:46.968 --> 25:49.971
I'm done feeling guilty about who I am.

25:55.893 --> 25:57.645
I'm getting there.

26:00.064 --> 26:01.483
Eat your greens.

26:11.951 --> 26:15.121
I drank. I vomited.

26:15.204 --> 26:18.749
It's not kicking in. It's not kicking in.

26:18.833 --> 26:20.876
Hola! Señor! Mescalito!

26:20.960 --> 26:23.505
Hello! Oh! Ah! Oh, fuck!

26:23.587 --> 26:25.714
Goddamn it! Motherfucker!
God...

26:25.798 --> 26:29.885
[groaning]
Oh! My back!

26:29.969 --> 26:32.180
[cell phone ringing]

26:40.480 --> 26:41.981
- Hello.
- Don't hang up!

26:42.064 --> 26:44.567
- What do you want?
- My Skeflaxin.

26:44.650 --> 26:46.528
That's not a word.

26:46.610 --> 26:48.654
No, it's medicine.
My back's in spasm.

26:48.737 --> 26:51.615
I can't move.
It's totally harshing my buzz.

26:51.699 --> 26:52.950
Where are they?

26:53.034 --> 26:56.579
In the meditation room
in the pill basket next to my shrine.

26:57.913 --> 27:00.208
Okay.

27:00.291 --> 27:02.502
I'll be right with you.

27:02.585 --> 27:05.421
I will! Motherfucker!

27:05.505 --> 27:08.424
- Okay, where are you?
- I'm in the desert.

27:08.508 --> 27:10.343
But there is water here.

27:11.260 --> 27:14.556
- You mean the beach?
- Am I?

27:14.638 --> 27:15.973
I love the beach.

27:17.392 --> 27:18.476
[phone beeps off]

27:18.560 --> 27:19.935
[Frankie blowing wooden flute]

27:22.855 --> 27:24.857
You could just live here.

27:24.940 --> 27:26.275
[grunts]

27:26.359 --> 27:28.736
- Thank you.
- What are those?

27:28.819 --> 27:32.240
- Muscle relaxers.
- Nice.

27:43.959 --> 27:45.127
Okay.

27:45.211 --> 27:49.048
[gags]
That is the worst iced tea ever.

27:49.131 --> 27:50.883
What is in there? Ass?

27:50.966 --> 27:53.135
Peyote.

27:53.219 --> 27:55.638
- Peyo-tea.
- What?

27:55.721 --> 27:57.806
[laughing]

27:57.890 --> 28:00.602
I just took muscle relaxers with peyote?

28:00.684 --> 28:03.646
- And you're welcome.
- What do I do?

28:03.729 --> 28:06.899
You should probably brace yourself
for some light vomiting

28:06.982 --> 28:09.444
followed by life-altering hallucinations.

28:09.527 --> 28:12.530
- [panting]
- [Frankie blowing wooden flute]

28:12.614 --> 28:15.991
[retching, groans]

28:16.075 --> 28:18.702
Just let it all out.

28:18.786 --> 28:21.705
This is why I hate
being around you!

28:21.789 --> 28:22.790
You're reckless!

28:22.873 --> 28:27.711
You leave drugs around,
and your hippy-dippy attitude

28:27.795 --> 28:31.132
and that "everybody should follow
their heart" crap

28:31.215 --> 28:34.302
and "everybody'll be just fine!"

28:34.385 --> 28:36.679
Well, everybody's not fine!

28:42.768 --> 28:46.939
Am I supposed
to be able to smell color?

28:47.022 --> 28:49.817
- It's your journey.
- Oh, shut up.

28:49.900 --> 28:51.944
My journey...

28:52.027 --> 28:54.113
And you wonder why your
husband looked elsewhere--

28:54.196 --> 28:56.407
Now you're gonna blame me?

28:56.491 --> 28:59.452
Why don't you take responsibility
for your own life?

29:00.828 --> 29:04.540
I am not responsible...

29:06.501 --> 29:08.252
Stop dancing.

29:09.962 --> 29:11.797
I didn't realize I was.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.800
I did everything right, Lord.

29:14.883 --> 29:17.886
I stood by him for over 40 years.

29:17.970 --> 29:21.807
I raised his children,
I shopped with his mother.

29:21.890 --> 29:25.728
I did every single thing
so he wouldn't have to worry about it.

29:25.811 --> 29:28.230
I played by all the rules.

29:28.314 --> 29:32.985
Why didn't you tell me
there were no rules? It's not fair!

29:33.068 --> 29:35.070
Your anger is frightening the sand.

29:35.154 --> 29:37.198
I'm not angry.

29:37.281 --> 29:38.782
Why aren't you angry?

29:38.866 --> 29:41.744
Because that's not me.
That's you.

29:41.827 --> 29:45.122
He ruined your life, humiliated you.

29:45.206 --> 29:48.751
That's not why he did it,
it's just the way he is.

29:48.834 --> 29:51.546
He lied about everything.

29:51.629 --> 29:53.464
He didn't know how to handle it.

29:53.548 --> 29:57.009
He abandoned you in your last years.

29:57.092 --> 29:59.970
- Aren't you even angry about that?
- No!

30:00.054 --> 30:02.097
Why not?!

30:02.181 --> 30:06.644
Because...
[sobbing] I'm heartbroken.

30:06.728 --> 30:07.853
[gasps]

30:11.399 --> 30:13.401
You're crying.

30:20.616 --> 30:22.577
There's a whole world in here.

30:26.872 --> 30:28.207
Wow.

30:36.716 --> 30:38.426
End to end.

30:39.051 --> 30:41.136
Look at... that thing over there.

30:42.597 --> 30:45.224
- Hi.
- Welcome.

30:45.307 --> 30:47.393
- Where is he?
- Welcome.

30:47.476 --> 30:48.728
There he is.

30:52.481 --> 30:53.941
[birds calling]

30:54.817 --> 30:57.695
See those two birds?

30:57.779 --> 30:59.447
Behind Jesus?

30:59.530 --> 31:03.409
I don't see Jesus.
But that's the general direction.

31:03.492 --> 31:07.037
They look like they really
love each other, don't they?

31:07.121 --> 31:11.250
- Do birds mate for life?
- No one does.

31:11.333 --> 31:14.837
Whichever one of you is the lady bird,
don't trust him!

31:14.920 --> 31:17.548
He'll break you in two and
leave you crumbled in the dirt!

31:17.632 --> 31:21.510
Save yourself!
Fly away! Fly away!

31:21.594 --> 31:22.678
You warned her.

31:25.640 --> 31:27.141
I am a little angry.

31:28.934 --> 31:31.687
- You are?
- Yeah, at myself.

31:33.397 --> 31:35.608
I mean, there were times...

31:35.691 --> 31:38.402
and I just thought...

31:38.486 --> 31:42.281
I guess I should've known
something wasn't...

31:42.364 --> 31:44.950
But I couldn't...

31:45.033 --> 31:47.328
I ignored it.

31:51.666 --> 31:54.836
I walked into
Robert's study yesterday...

31:54.918 --> 31:57.839
for the first time in...

31:57.921 --> 32:00.090
I don't know how many years.

32:00.966 --> 32:06.096
It was right there,
in front of my face the whole time.

32:06.180 --> 32:09.892
Where was I? I missed it.

32:12.144 --> 32:14.689
Sol once asked me to wear a dildo.

32:14.772 --> 32:16.357
That's worse.

32:17.900 --> 32:21.195
[sighs]
Let's go back.

32:37.461 --> 32:39.129
You can do it.

32:39.963 --> 32:41.215
Whoa.

32:43.425 --> 32:44.552
Okay.

32:49.849 --> 32:53.728
Wow, I must have half
the beach in my vagina.

33:39.147 --> 33:42.234
- Cialis?
- Sol's.

33:42.317 --> 33:45.195
[laughing]

33:47.281 --> 33:51.243
Ooh!
I think I peed a little on Ryan Gosling.

34:04.924 --> 34:06.675
Now what?
