WEBVTT

00:13.361 --> 00:14.710
Oh, hey, Calvin.
What's up?

00:14.753 --> 00:17.060
Hey, can I borrow some milk
for my cereal?

00:17.104 --> 00:19.193
Malcolm used up all of ours.

00:19.236 --> 00:20.759
But your bowl's empty.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.935
Yeah, he finished
all the cereal, too.

00:23.936 --> 00:26.330
Do you have anything
that's magically delicious?

00:27.853 --> 00:30.465
Yeah, sure. Let me get you
some of Grover's good stuff.

00:30.508 --> 00:32.119
You want
the sugar-free quinoa flakes

00:32.162 --> 00:34.382
or the date-sweetened
fiber puffs?

00:35.426 --> 00:36.949
I'll take a banana.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.083
Oh, yeah, L.A. is way different

00:40.127 --> 00:41.911
than Hickory Corners--
it's always sunny,

00:41.954 --> 00:44.000
there's tons of culture,

00:44.044 --> 00:47.743
and nobody grocery shops
shirtless.

00:47.786 --> 00:49.788
Honey, who is that?My sister.

00:49.832 --> 00:51.486
Brittany?

00:51.529 --> 00:53.270
Do not give her money,

00:53.314 --> 00:55.142
and do not invite her here.

00:55.185 --> 00:57.318
Of course! We'd love
for you to visit.

00:57.361 --> 00:59.276
No! N...

00:59.320 --> 01:00.756
Hey, uh, Gemma,

01:00.799 --> 01:02.932
did you read this article
on California earthquakes?

01:02.975 --> 01:05.978
They say the big one
is coming any day now.

01:07.328 --> 01:09.069
: I wouldn't
worry about that.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.246
I've lived in California
my whole life.

01:12.289 --> 01:14.596
Never been hurt
in an earthquake.

01:14.639 --> 01:16.119
What are you doing?

01:16.163 --> 01:17.860
That's for your sucky cereal.

01:19.035 --> 01:21.820
All right, well,
love you, too. Bye.

01:21.864 --> 01:23.953
Wow, Dave, there's
actually someone out there

01:23.996 --> 01:25.085
you don't like?

01:25.128 --> 01:27.043
What's her secret?

01:27.087 --> 01:29.089
Calvin, you don't understand.

01:30.568 --> 01:32.483
Gemma's sister is
a total disaster.

01:32.527 --> 01:34.920
She flakes on everything,
nothing's ever her fault,

01:34.964 --> 01:37.880
and the only time
we ever hear from her is
when she needs something.

01:37.923 --> 01:40.056
That's not true.Oh, yeah?
What about the time

01:40.100 --> 01:41.188
she asked you for a kidney?

01:41.231 --> 01:43.494
That's not fair.
It wasn't even for her.

01:44.974 --> 01:47.933
O-Okay, okay, so she's
still figuring her life out.

01:47.977 --> 01:50.501
But she's got a good heart.Yeah, which she probably

01:50.545 --> 01:52.024
suckered someone
into giving her.

01:53.809 --> 01:56.159
You know, she sounds like
Tina's cousin Lamar,

01:56.203 --> 01:58.161
who she found out
wasn't her cousin,

01:58.205 --> 01:59.771
or named Lamar.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.297
Well, then you know
what I'm talking about

02:03.340 --> 02:05.342
and why the last person
I want here

02:05.386 --> 02:07.039
is... Oh, Brittany.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.215
Surprise!

02:08.258 --> 02:09.390
Brittany!

02:09.433 --> 02:10.478
Oh, my God!

02:11.566 --> 02:13.002
Forget the banana.

02:13.045 --> 02:16.092
Thisis magically delicious.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.050
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:18.094 --> 02:19.095
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:23.926 --> 02:25.971
I can't believe
you're really here.

02:26.015 --> 02:27.408
Thought it'd be
a fun surprise.

02:27.451 --> 02:30.193
Like when you
showed up on our honeymoon.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.195
That was the best
two weeks ever.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.241
Thanks again for
bailing me out.

02:35.590 --> 02:38.419
Mexican jails are no bueno.

02:38.462 --> 02:41.204
Uh, so, Brittany,
what brings you here?

02:41.248 --> 02:44.207
I know it wasn't Greyhound,
because they banned you.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.209
I've always wanted to
come to California,

02:46.253 --> 02:48.472
and I finally finished
dental hygiene school.

02:48.516 --> 02:51.649
You graduated?
Congratulations!

02:51.693 --> 02:53.042
Oh, no, I didn't
say I graduated.

02:53.085 --> 02:54.174
I just stopped going.

02:56.045 --> 02:59.004
Uh, uh, what about the money
we gave you for tuition?

02:59.048 --> 03:00.354
Oh, don't worry,
I used it,

03:00.397 --> 03:01.877
and I enrolled in
a cosmetology course.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.661
Oh, that's great.
How's it going?

03:03.705 --> 03:04.793
Oh, I quit that, too.

03:04.836 --> 03:06.925
They wanted me to go
four days a week,

03:06.969 --> 03:09.101
and it's, like, I want
to be a cosmetologist,

03:09.145 --> 03:10.712
not a doctor.

03:10.755 --> 03:14.106
Okay, well, it was great
of you to stop by on your way

03:14.150 --> 03:15.369
to somewhere else.

03:17.066 --> 03:18.502
Actually, I was kind of
hoping I could hang here

03:18.546 --> 03:19.938
until I figured out
my next move?

03:19.982 --> 03:21.375
Of course.
You're my little sister.

03:21.418 --> 03:23.507
You can stay
as long as you want.

03:23.551 --> 03:26.206
Cool. So, where am I crashing?

03:26.249 --> 03:28.512
You can sleep in my room.
I have bunk beds.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.558
Ha-ha! It'll be like
we're cellmates.

03:32.995 --> 03:35.215
Hey, Dave.

03:35.258 --> 03:38.174
How's the new roommate
working out?

03:38.218 --> 03:41.221
Are you as miserable as I hope?

03:41.264 --> 03:43.223
Even worse.

03:43.266 --> 03:46.138
She has been here one day,
and she already broke the oven,

03:46.182 --> 03:48.576
erased our DVR,
and this morning...

03:48.619 --> 03:52.232
she used my
karate gi as a bathrobe.

03:52.275 --> 03:55.713
Dave, you got yourself
a freeloader on your hands.

03:55.757 --> 03:58.412
And it's your own fault
for putting up with it.

03:58.455 --> 04:00.196
What am I supposed to do?
She's Gemma's sister.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.850
Family doesn't get a pass.

04:01.893 --> 04:04.200
I don't care
if she was my mama.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.942
Calvin Butler would nip
that nonsense in the bud.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.291
Kee-ya!

04:08.335 --> 04:09.379
Ha!

04:09.423 --> 04:11.425
Hey, guys.

04:11.468 --> 04:12.904
Oh, Pop, just a heads-up.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.384
I went over
the family data limit,

04:14.428 --> 04:16.430
so the phone bill's gonna be
a little bit high.

04:16.473 --> 04:19.824
: Lot of great fights
on YouTube this month.

04:19.868 --> 04:22.218
Well, good thing you...

04:22.262 --> 04:24.438
nipped thatnonsense
in the bud.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.266
Oh, and,

04:26.309 --> 04:29.094
uh, for the
record, it's...

04:29.138 --> 04:30.357
Kee-ya!

04:36.493 --> 04:38.843
Hey, Ma, is it cool if I
borrow your car tonight?

04:38.887 --> 04:41.281
Oh, sure, baby.
But it's just about out of gas.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.760
Oh, don't worry,
I got you.

04:42.804 --> 04:44.371
Where's your gas card?

04:45.372 --> 04:47.287
Hergas card?

04:47.330 --> 04:51.160
You do know
they take yourcash?

04:51.203 --> 04:54.424
Yeah, Pop, but then Mom
wouldn't get herpoints.

04:54.468 --> 04:56.774
Yeah, Calvin-- why are you
trying to take my points?

04:56.818 --> 04:59.168
What are they even for?

04:59.211 --> 05:01.126
I don't know,
but they're mine
and I want 'em.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.954
Yeah.

05:02.998 --> 05:04.652
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.001
Uh, what are you doing?

05:06.044 --> 05:07.959
I'm getting a piece
of garlic bread.

05:08.003 --> 05:10.179
Yeah, but the middle piece?

05:10.222 --> 05:12.399
That's the one with the best
crust-to-butter ratio.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.184
Fine. What's the big deal, man?

05:15.227 --> 05:16.141
It's just bread.

05:16.185 --> 05:17.795
Oh, "it's just bread."

05:17.839 --> 05:20.189
Bread that you didn't buy
or that you didn't cook.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.148
Well, Calvin,
you didn't cook it, either.

05:23.192 --> 05:25.150
I'm trying
to make a point, Tina.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.370
Oh. So now you want your
points?

05:27.414 --> 05:29.198
Uh, look...

05:29.241 --> 05:31.243
he's had a job for a while now,

05:31.287 --> 05:33.811
and it's just time for him
to stop being a freeloader.

05:34.638 --> 05:35.987
A freeloader?

05:36.031 --> 05:38.555
Yeah. You know, I'm tired
of him not chipping in,

05:38.599 --> 05:41.689
so I'm nipping it in the bud
right now. Kee-ya!

05:43.038 --> 05:44.300
Calvin,

05:44.344 --> 05:45.388
Malcolm is not a freeloader.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.216
He's just trying
to get on his feet.

05:47.259 --> 05:49.131
Well, what he needs to do
is go in his wallet

05:49.174 --> 05:50.567
and give me some bread
for this bread.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.613
You know what? Fine.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.266
If that's the way you want it.

05:54.310 --> 05:55.964
Look. Here you go.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.402
Five dollars?

05:59.446 --> 06:01.273
That's all I have on me.

06:01.317 --> 06:03.101
Oh. Well, in that case...

06:04.407 --> 06:05.843
Enjoy your salad.

06:11.719 --> 06:14.243
Oh. Hey.
I didn't think you were home.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.810
Your car isn't out front.

06:15.853 --> 06:18.247
Oh, yeah. Brittany took it
to go get coffee.

06:18.290 --> 06:19.944
You let her borrow your car?

06:19.988 --> 06:21.772
That is so nice.

06:21.816 --> 06:24.296
Oh, I didn't say "borrow."
I said "took."

06:25.515 --> 06:28.475
Along with $20
and my favorite sunglasses.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.694
Dave, she's my
little sister.

06:30.738 --> 06:31.956
What do you want me to do?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.351
I want you
to stop enabling her.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.005
The reason she quits
everything that she does

06:37.048 --> 06:39.747
is she knows that you'll be
right there to bail her out.

06:39.790 --> 06:42.445
Sometimes literally.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.360
Dave, I'm not
enabling here.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.014
I'm being supportive.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.364
Things just don't come
as easily to her.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.931
Okay. Well,
just so you know,

06:49.974 --> 06:52.194
Grover said her Ouija
board spelled out

06:52.237 --> 06:54.283
"lend Brittany money"
last night.

06:57.329 --> 06:59.201
Look, it's not like
she's staying forever.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.159
We both know
in a few days

07:01.203 --> 07:02.552
she'll get bored and take off

07:02.596 --> 07:04.424
right after she asks
for a clean urine sample.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.253
Hey, guys. Guess what?

07:08.297 --> 07:09.516
You lost my sunglasses?

07:09.559 --> 07:10.647
Yep, that, too.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.476
What I meant was,
I finally figured out

07:13.520 --> 07:15.304
what I'm gonna do with my life.

07:16.348 --> 07:17.480
I'm gonna be an actor.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.834
What?

07:23.878 --> 07:25.357
I was in the
coffee shop

07:25.401 --> 07:26.924
and I was arguing
with the barista

07:26.968 --> 07:29.057
of whether or not
I brought the tip jar with me,

07:29.100 --> 07:31.146
when...

07:31.189 --> 07:32.930
this talent agent comes up,
and he says

07:32.974 --> 07:35.498
he's going to make me...
a star.

07:35.542 --> 07:36.717
Oh.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.936
Oh, sweetie,
I know that sounds exciting,

07:38.980 --> 07:41.548
but I'm not sure that
that's the way it works.

07:41.591 --> 07:43.854
Oh, uh, she's right.
It's a scam.

07:43.898 --> 07:46.466
Con artists preying
on naive dreamers.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.946
I was devastated.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.905
No, this guy's totally legit.

07:50.948 --> 07:53.516
He already got me an audition
for a commercial tomorrow.

07:53.560 --> 07:54.735
Really?

07:54.778 --> 07:55.997
Yeah.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.477
So looks like I'm here to stay.

07:58.565 --> 07:59.870
Huh.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.393
You hear that?

08:01.437 --> 08:02.830
She's here to stay.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.528
Whew!

08:05.572 --> 08:08.313
And we are here
to be supportive.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.579
BRITTANY:
This is so exciting!

08:12.622 --> 08:15.016
I'm gonna go practice my lines
up in my room.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.974
Now, that'sa
juicy burger.

08:17.018 --> 08:19.542
Now, that's a juicy burger!

08:19.586 --> 08:21.370
That's a juicy...

08:21.413 --> 08:23.590
This is a disaster.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.417
Dave, it's not as bad
as it seems.

08:25.461 --> 08:28.464
Yes, it is.
Those were my sunglasses!

08:29.683 --> 08:30.901
It should've been me!

08:34.470 --> 08:35.906
Oh, that looks tasty.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.386
Salami and cheese?

08:37.429 --> 08:39.562
Oh, yeah,
and all the fixings.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.651
Great. That'll be seven bucks.

08:42.913 --> 08:45.568
You can make it a combo
for a dollar more.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.833
You know, actually, Pop,
what you said last night

08:49.877 --> 08:51.792
made a whole lot of sense.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.576
I shouldn't be eating your food.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.578
So I went out
and I bought my own.

08:55.622 --> 08:58.015
Okay. Steppin' up, like I asked.

08:58.059 --> 09:01.105
You know what?
Fix me one of those, and, um,

09:01.149 --> 09:02.367
make it a combo.

09:03.891 --> 09:05.545
You know, I would, Pop,

09:05.588 --> 09:08.983
but this is all stuff
I bought myself. You see?

09:09.026 --> 09:11.594
I put my name on it.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.030
Okay.

09:13.074 --> 09:15.380
You're putting your
name on meat now?

09:15.424 --> 09:17.469
Who are you, Oscar Mayer?

09:18.775 --> 09:20.995
Yeah, well, this way,
you eat yourfood

09:21.038 --> 09:23.127
and I eat mine.
Mm-hmm!

09:23.171 --> 09:25.521
You know what?
That is a good idea.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.610
Mm.Maybe I should start putting

09:27.654 --> 09:30.482
my name on stuff
I paid for.

09:30.526 --> 09:31.614
Okay.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.573
Look at that-- looks like

09:33.616 --> 09:34.748
your sandwich

09:34.791 --> 09:36.097
is on my plate.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.579
Well, lucky for me,

09:39.622 --> 09:41.363
this meal is handheld.

09:41.406 --> 09:44.061
That islucky for you.

09:44.105 --> 09:47.021
But what is not lucky for you
is that your food...

09:47.064 --> 09:49.066
is in my fridge.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.767
Not a problem.
I'll get a mini fridge

09:53.810 --> 09:55.246
for my room.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.379
Yes. A problem.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.033
Because...

09:59.076 --> 10:03.428
your room is in my house.

10:03.472 --> 10:06.475
Well, in that case,
maybe I need a place of my own.

10:06.518 --> 10:08.651
Maybe you do.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.435
Well, maybe I should go look
for one right now.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.786
Maybe you should.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.701
You know what? Fine.

10:20.358 --> 10:21.664
Hello?

10:21.708 --> 10:24.275
CALVIN:
I just wanted to remind you...

10:25.537 --> 10:27.365
...that's my phone.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.203
Well, I hope you're happy.

10:39.247 --> 10:41.597
I just got off the
phone with Malcolm.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.555
He already found a place.

10:43.599 --> 10:46.471
So he's still using my phone?

10:46.515 --> 10:48.952
Calvin, your son is moving
into a one bedroom

10:48.996 --> 10:50.693
with four strangers

10:50.737 --> 10:53.565
all because the both of you
are too stubborn to back down.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.350
Me? Stubborn?

10:55.393 --> 10:57.657
I'll sit here all day
and argue that.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.790
Come on, Tina.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.923
Moving out is gonna
be good for him.

11:02.966 --> 11:04.881
How?
Well, for starters,

11:04.925 --> 11:06.187
with him out of the house,

11:06.230 --> 11:08.406
I don't have
to wear pants anymore.

11:08.450 --> 11:12.236
That's not good for him,
that's good for you.

11:12.280 --> 11:16.023
Well, actually,
it's good for you.

11:21.289 --> 11:24.727
You need to apologize
to your son and tell him

11:24.771 --> 11:26.816
he can stay, or
things are gonna

11:26.860 --> 11:28.252
get ugly around here.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.385
How ugly?

11:30.428 --> 11:32.648
Remember the Valentine's Day
you bought me a toaster?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.041
Uglier than that.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.871
Good morning.

11:37.914 --> 11:41.831
Seriously? For the last time,
stop wearing my gi.

11:41.875 --> 11:45.356
It's a slap in the face
to Sensei Chad.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.359
So, how are you feeling?

11:48.403 --> 11:49.839
Are you ready
for your big audition?

11:49.883 --> 11:51.928
Oh, yeah, Grover and I
rehearsed all night.

11:51.972 --> 11:53.190
Check it out.

11:53.234 --> 11:57.151
Now, that's a tasty burger.

11:57.194 --> 11:59.414
I thought it was
a "juicy" burger?

11:59.457 --> 12:00.676
Yeah, but I decided "juicy"

12:00.720 --> 12:03.853
isn't a word
my character would use.

12:03.897 --> 12:07.770
And yet, you have it tattooed
on your lower back.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.598
So, what time
do you have to be there?

12:09.641 --> 12:10.512
Not until 9:00.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.862
Brittany! It's 8:45.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.951
Oh, my God, you're right.
Okay, I'm just gonna eat

12:14.995 --> 12:16.648
something really quick
and then we'll go.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.433
Where's your pancake mix?What? No! No, no, no.

12:18.476 --> 12:20.652
No, no, no, no.
No pancakes.

12:20.696 --> 12:23.655
Go put on some clothes. If we
hurry, we can still make it.

12:23.699 --> 12:26.049
Fine. I'll meet you in the car.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.356
We'll just hit up a
drive-through on the way there.

12:33.883 --> 12:34.884
Hey.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.320
Hey.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.800
I got some boxes,

12:37.844 --> 12:39.671
so I'll be out of your way
by tonight.

12:39.715 --> 12:43.632
Look, about that, um,

12:43.675 --> 12:45.634
things got a little
out of hand yesterday,

12:45.677 --> 12:48.898
so you don't have to move out
if you don't want to.

12:48.942 --> 12:51.074
Oh, thank you, Pop. You know,
I've been feeling bad

12:51.118 --> 12:53.555
about the way things
went down, too.

12:53.598 --> 12:57.646
Great. Well, go tell your mom
I said all that sensitive crap.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.822
And, uh,

12:59.866 --> 13:01.650
you know, tell her we hugged.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.739
She'll eat that stuff up
right there.

13:05.523 --> 13:07.569
Wait, so you're only
saying you want me to stay

13:07.612 --> 13:09.005
because Mom made you?

13:09.049 --> 13:11.834
Yeah.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.968
You expect me to wear pants
the rest of my life?

13:16.230 --> 13:17.753
You know what?
Do whatever you want,

13:17.797 --> 13:19.799
because I'm not gonna
be here to see it.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.975
Really? You gonna act like that

13:22.018 --> 13:25.195
after I said everything
your mama made me say?

13:26.718 --> 13:28.372
I-I expected more from you.

13:28.416 --> 13:31.027
And this is exactly
what I expected from you.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.986
What is that supposed to mean?

13:33.029 --> 13:34.770
I don't know, ask Mom.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.817
Ha! Well, the joke's on you,

13:37.860 --> 13:39.993
because she's not talking to me.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.650
Oh, you're back.

13:45.694 --> 13:47.391
How'd the audition go?

13:47.435 --> 13:49.002
Not great.

13:49.045 --> 13:52.875
Brittany "accidentally" spilled
coffee on another actress

13:52.919 --> 13:56.226
and then asked the casting
director when the baby was due.

13:56.270 --> 13:59.142
Huh. She wasn't pregnant?

13:59.186 --> 14:01.188
No, hewasn't.

14:01.231 --> 14:02.842
Oh.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.756
Now that's a juicy burger.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.892
Dave, when she comes down,
please be nice to her.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.851
She's in a very fragile state
right now.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.853
Oh, I don't care
what state she's in,

14:13.896 --> 14:15.898
as long as it's not California.

14:15.942 --> 14:16.899
Dave.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.597
But I will be nice.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.730
Well, my agent just called.

14:21.773 --> 14:23.297
I'm sorry, sweetie.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.038
I know how much you wanted this. Yeah.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.561
Don't be too hard on yourself.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.084
What are you guys talking about?

14:28.128 --> 14:29.390
I got the part.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.306
What?!
Of course.

14:32.349 --> 14:35.178
Yeah, they said they loved my
"spunky, unpredictable energy,"

14:35.222 --> 14:36.745
which is funny,
'cause that's exactly

14:36.788 --> 14:39.704
what my parole officer hated.

14:39.748 --> 14:42.925
Wow. Uh, you did it.
Congratulations.

14:42.969 --> 14:46.015
Thanks. Too bad I had
to turn it down.

14:46.059 --> 14:47.930
What?Of course.

14:50.019 --> 14:52.195
Why would you turn it down?

14:52.239 --> 14:53.980
Well, think about it.

14:54.023 --> 14:59.072
If I booked my first audition,
I am clearly a great actor.

14:59.115 --> 15:02.075
And great actors
don't do commercials.

15:04.033 --> 15:06.557
But this is a huge opportunity.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.211
You're just gonna throw it away?

15:08.255 --> 15:10.735
Yeah. Plus, they said
it was gonna air in Mexico,

15:10.779 --> 15:12.520
and I've got
muchowarrants down there.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.871
You know what?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.003
Dave is right.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.483
I do enable you.

15:19.527 --> 15:22.008
I have given you
so many chances

15:22.051 --> 15:24.532
and made so many excuses
for you,

15:24.575 --> 15:26.534
and all you do is screw it up.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.057
But I am done.

15:28.101 --> 15:31.278
You need to get your stuff
and go home, now.

15:34.890 --> 15:37.458
I know. You're right.

15:37.501 --> 15:38.981
I'm a disaster.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.331
And the worst part is,

15:41.375 --> 15:42.942
I don't even know why.

15:42.985 --> 15:46.032
I-I quit anything I start,

15:46.075 --> 15:48.904
anything good in my life
I find a way to ruin.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.297
Even our relationship.

15:52.299 --> 15:55.476
You're the best big sister
anybody could have,

15:55.519 --> 15:57.957
and all I do is I-I just
take advantage of you.

15:59.262 --> 16:04.659
I don't know what else to say,
but I'm... I'm sorry.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.922
I'm gonna go pack my things.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.012
Uh, Brittany, wait.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.013
I'm sorry I said that.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.928
Please, please, please don't go.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.408
Are you sure?

16:14.451 --> 16:17.019
Of course.
You're my little sister.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.108
And scene.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.027
Wait, what?

16:26.637 --> 16:29.075
I told you. I am a great actor.

16:30.119 --> 16:31.773
You just made
all that up?

16:31.816 --> 16:34.689
Not all. I stole a few lines
from Gossip Girl.

16:34.732 --> 16:37.039
Oh, my God.Oh, my God.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.041
All right.

16:39.085 --> 16:42.044
That's it. You need
to leave... now.What?

16:42.088 --> 16:43.132
You heard me.Okay, but...

16:43.176 --> 16:44.960
No, I'm not giving you my pee.

16:46.048 --> 16:49.617
Fine. Haters gonna hate.

16:56.145 --> 16:57.451
You did it.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.061
You finally
stood up to her.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.628
I know, but
I was so harsh.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.064
Do you think
she'll get over it?

17:02.108 --> 17:04.110
Of course she's gonna
get over it.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.068
I'll tell you
what I'll never get over.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.723
She is a way better actor
than I'll ever be.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.076
Well, that's everything.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.339
You know, I can't believe
you and your father

17:16.383 --> 17:18.080
are being so stubborn
about this.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.342
He's the stubborn one.

17:19.386 --> 17:20.909
I just refuse to give in.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.827
Calvin, Malcolm's leaving!

17:27.655 --> 17:29.831
Don't you have anything
to say to him?

17:29.874 --> 17:31.833
Fine.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.795
Seriously?

17:37.839 --> 17:40.102
You two have nothing
to say to each other?

17:40.146 --> 17:43.018
Nope.Nope.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.803
See, that's what your problem
is-- you're too much alike.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.370
No, we're not.No, we're not.

17:47.414 --> 17:48.937
You know what?

17:48.980 --> 17:51.374
Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is a good idea.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.028
With Malcolm gone,

17:53.072 --> 17:55.378
you can finally watch
football all by yourself

17:55.422 --> 17:56.945
without anyone to debate

17:56.988 --> 17:59.948
about who's the best player,
or argue over calls.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.993
Sounds good to me.

18:02.037 --> 18:05.040
And, Malcolm, you won't be stuck
playing cards with your dad.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.520
You know,
talking about politics

18:06.563 --> 18:08.043
and what's going on
in the world.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.045
That's right. I can do
that with my roommates.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.308
Yeah, and since two of you
sleep in the living room,

18:12.352 --> 18:14.963
y'all can chitchat
all night long.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.706
Yeah, that's...
that's gonna be fun.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.188
And, Calvin, you don't
have to remind Malcolm

18:22.231 --> 18:23.841
about taking the
trash out anymore,

18:23.885 --> 18:26.105
because you'll be doing it!That's right.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.542
Uh-huh.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.850
Well, now that we all agree
this is for the best--

18:32.894 --> 18:34.765
Calvin, tomorrow's
trash day.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.767
Malcolm, don't let
the doorknob hit ya

18:36.811 --> 18:38.073
where the good Lord
split ya.

18:42.773 --> 18:44.775
So, uh...

18:44.819 --> 18:46.995
really? Two of y'all sleep
in the living room?

18:47.038 --> 18:48.866
It's not as bad
as it sounds.

18:48.910 --> 18:51.260
We got a line of
tape down the middle.

18:53.088 --> 18:54.655
Well, fine.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.526
I hope you enjoy
watching football with him.

18:56.570 --> 18:59.050
Well, actually,
we don't have cable,

18:59.094 --> 19:01.488
which would be useless
anyway, because...

19:01.531 --> 19:03.142
we don't have a TV.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.969
What?!

19:05.013 --> 19:06.667
Man, that's crazy.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.886
Every man deserves
to watch football.

19:08.930 --> 19:10.714
I think
that's in the Constitution.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.327
I'll tell you what.

19:14.370 --> 19:18.069
Why don't you come over Sunday
and watch one of the games?

19:18.113 --> 19:20.550
Okay, that'd be cool.

19:20.594 --> 19:24.163
Of course... there's also
Monday Night Football.

19:25.686 --> 19:28.602
And Thursday.

19:28.645 --> 19:31.126
That would be a lot of
driving back and forth.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.997
Especially
without your mama's gas card.

19:35.043 --> 19:37.045
Well, maybe...

19:37.088 --> 19:39.613
you should finish out
the season here.

19:39.656 --> 19:42.790
That does seem like
the logical solution.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.661
Yeah, all right.

19:44.705 --> 19:47.925
Well, uh, maybe you should
just stay for a little while.

19:47.969 --> 19:50.014
Yeah, for a little while.

19:50.058 --> 19:51.494
All right.
Well, good. Come on.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.670
Let me help you get
these boxes in, son.

19:53.714 --> 19:54.976
Hey, you know what, Pop?

19:55.019 --> 19:57.413
If I am gonna stay
here for a little while,

19:57.457 --> 19:59.589
I think I should
start paying rent.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.200
You damn straight you are.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.072
And I'm talking market rate.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.943
I don't play
that rent control.

20:12.298 --> 20:15.388
Hey, Dave. You take Brittany
to the airport?

20:15.431 --> 20:17.303
Actually, the train station.

20:17.346 --> 20:20.175
She says the airport is
"bounty hunter central."

20:21.481 --> 20:22.960
Well, congratulations.

20:23.004 --> 20:24.527
You got rid of your freeloader.

20:24.571 --> 20:26.877
Oh, not me.
It was all Gemma.

20:26.921 --> 20:28.705
What about you?

20:28.749 --> 20:31.055
Uh, you and Malcolm
figure everything out?

20:31.099 --> 20:35.146
Yeah. You know, um, he and Tina
begged me not to kick him out,

20:35.190 --> 20:38.149
so, what are you gonna do,
you know?

20:39.281 --> 20:40.717
Dave, we got to go.

20:40.761 --> 20:42.110
Where?

20:42.153 --> 20:43.633
The train station
just called.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.287
Apparently,
they have a jail.

20:46.897 --> 20:48.551
Oh, check out
this crazy white girl

20:48.595 --> 20:50.161
fighting on YouTube.

20:50.205 --> 20:51.815
Brittany?!

20:52.903 --> 20:55.079
Damn!

20:55.123 --> 20:56.994
She put that conductor
to sleep.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.346
And look at that.

21:00.389 --> 21:02.261
She's wearing my sunglasses!
