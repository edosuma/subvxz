WEBVTT

00:03.971 --> 00:05.836
Okay, we've got power to the laser.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.335
I should've brought an umbrella.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.341
- What for? It's not gonna rain.
- I know.

00:11.512 --> 00:16.347
But with skin as fair as mine,
moon burn is a real possibility.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.241
That's a buzzinga, right?

00:18.685 --> 00:20.880
One of my best, don't you think?

00:24.024 --> 00:26.515
Howard, double-check
the equatorial mount on the laser.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.685
- We need it locked on the Sea of Tranquility.
- You got it.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.892
Raj, no.

00:32.064 --> 00:34.863
Billions of dollars have gone
into inventing the Internet...

00:35.035 --> 00:39.529
...and filling it with pictures of naked women
so we don't have to peep through windows.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.099
It's not like that.
I'm watching someone's TV.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.402
<i>The Good Wife</i> is on.

00:45.546 --> 00:49.038
I tell you,
this is my new <i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>

00:50.050 --> 00:51.711
Leonard, what is that? What is that?

00:53.387 --> 00:55.048
Relax, it's just a dirty sock.

00:56.023 --> 00:59.891
How on earth can you say "dirty sock"
and "relax" in the same sentence?

01:01.194 --> 01:04.288
Sheldon, the world is filled
with dirty, discarded socks.

01:05.632 --> 01:07.463
Not my world.

01:08.635 --> 01:11.399
You know who'd really dig
seeing this experiment? Penny.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.932
I wasn't aware that lunar ranging
was her thing.

01:15.108 --> 01:16.132
Although I suppose...

01:16.310 --> 01:19.040
...the retro reflector left on the moon
by Neil Armstrong...

01:19.212 --> 01:21.476
...does qualify as a shiny object.

01:22.616 --> 01:23.947
Ask her to come up.

01:24.117 --> 01:26.415
I don't know. It's still weird since,
you know...

01:26.587 --> 01:28.418
- She dumped you?
- She didn't dump me.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.989
We were just in different places
in the relationship.

01:31.158 --> 01:32.785
I fail to see how a relationship...

01:32.960 --> 01:35.622
...can have the qualities
of a geographic location.

01:35.796 --> 01:40.256
Well, it's very simple. Leonard was living
in a town called Please Don't Leave Me...

01:40.434 --> 01:44.302
...while Penny had just moved
to the island of Bye-bye.

01:47.407 --> 01:49.602
Screw you, guys.
I'm gonna go see if she's home.

01:50.611 --> 01:54.274
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to point this at the moon now.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.916
Wait a second.
The good wife is crying.

01:57.684 --> 01:58.776
Something's very wrong.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.149 --> 02:30.446
Oh, hi. What's going on?

02:30.617 --> 02:33.108
We're up on the roof
bouncing laser beams off the moon.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.285
I'm sorry, what?

02:35.455 --> 02:38.549
It's cool. We've got a two-meter
parabolic reflector and everything.

02:38.725 --> 02:41.285
- I thought you might wanna see it.
- That makes no sense.

02:42.462 --> 02:46.296
How can you bounce stuff off the moon?
There's no gravity.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.994
Oh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.070
- Hey.
- Sorry, I didn't know you were busy.

02:52.239 --> 02:53.797
- Maybe another time.
- Yeah. Maybe.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.875
- Hey, I wanna see this laser thing.
- Oh, what about the party?

02:57.044 --> 03:00.309
It's a surprise party,
doesn't matter when we get there.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.039
Right.

03:03.483 --> 03:04.882
Okay, well, yeah, come on up.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.689
So how'd you guys meet?

03:12.859 --> 03:16.158
My company designs the menus
for The Cheesecake Factory.

03:16.329 --> 03:17.318
Your company?

03:17.497 --> 03:20.330
My dad, but me and my sister are VPs.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.332
So menus.

03:23.503 --> 03:26.995
It sounds easy, but there's a lot of science
that goes into designing them.

03:33.280 --> 03:36.215
Happy now? I'm moving the dirty sock.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.845
Thank you.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.678
Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.

03:43.690 --> 03:46.022
- Hey, guys. This is my friend Zack.
- Hey.

03:46.193 --> 03:50.186
- Hello.
- Whoa, is that the laser? It's bitchen.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.689
Yes. In 1917...

03:53.867 --> 03:57.428
...when Albert Einstein established
the theoretic foundation for the laser...

03:57.604 --> 03:59.936
...in his paper
<i>Zur Quantentheorle der Strahlung...</i>

04:00.107 --> 04:04.635
...his fondest hope was that
the resultant device be "bitchen."

04:05.879 --> 04:07.244
Well, mission accomplished.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.980
Let me explain what we're doing here.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.552
In 1969, the astronauts on <i>Apollo 11...</i>

04:14.721 --> 04:16.483
...positioned reflectors on the moon.

04:16.656 --> 04:18.714
We're gonna shoot a laser
off one of them...

04:18.892 --> 04:21.553
...and let the light bounce back
into this photomultiplier.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.286
Oh, that's very cool.

04:23.463 --> 04:27.399
One question: How can you be sure
it won't blow up?

04:28.001 --> 04:30.060
- The laser?
- The moon.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.232
See, now this is a man for Penny.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.902
- That's a great question, Zack.
- No, it's not.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.413
- Sheldon, play nice.
- It's not a great question.

04:43.583 --> 04:46.780
How could somebody possibly think
we're going to blow up the moon?

04:48.488 --> 04:50.979
That's a great question.

04:52.159 --> 04:55.595
Don't worry about the moon.
We set our laser to stun.

04:56.263 --> 04:57.753
Smart.

04:57.931 --> 05:01.799
We'll see the beam when it leaves. It won't
be strong enough when it comes back...

05:01.968 --> 05:04.664
- ...to be seen by the naked eye.
- Naked. Heh, heh, heh.

05:09.442 --> 05:11.603
Right, funny.

05:12.012 --> 05:15.448
So that device there
will measure the photons that return...

05:15.615 --> 05:18.778
...and show it to us on this computer.
Raj, get them some glasses.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.552
Cool, it's gonna be in 3-D?

05:27.027 --> 05:29.962
Preparing to fire laser at the moon.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.461
Make it so.

05:36.136 --> 05:38.161
There it is. There's the spike.

05:38.338 --> 05:42.069
Two-point-five seconds for the light to
return. That's the moon. We hit the moon.

05:45.679 --> 05:49.308
That's your big experiment?
All that for a line on the screen?

05:49.916 --> 05:52.908
Yeah, but think
about what this represents.

05:53.086 --> 05:56.419
The fact that we can do this
is the only way of definitively proving...

05:56.590 --> 05:58.854
...that there are man-made objects
on the moon...

05:59.025 --> 06:01.493
...put there by a species
that only 60 years before...

06:01.661 --> 06:03.652
...had just invented the airplane.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.658
What species is that?

06:08.735 --> 06:11.033
I was wrong. Penny can do better.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.571
- Okay, guys, thank you. It's been fun.
- Yeah, thanks.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.608
- Should we invite them to the party?
- No, just keep walking.

06:18.778 --> 06:20.837
He's must be very skilled at coitus.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.010
I'm telling you, dude...

06:25.185 --> 06:28.712
...the only way to feel better
about Penny going out with other guys...

06:28.889 --> 06:32.222
...is for you to get back on the whores.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.692
- Horse.
- What?

06:36.863 --> 06:41.027
The phrase is "get back on the horse."
Not whores.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.536
That's disgusting, dude.

06:44.871 --> 06:48.068
No, it's not... Never mind.

06:48.742 --> 06:49.936
He is right, though.

06:50.110 --> 06:53.375
If you want, I can turn you on
to this great new dating site I found.

06:53.546 --> 06:54.570
No, thanks.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.216
You sure? They say
they can find a match for anybody.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.614
- Have they found a match for you?
- Tons.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.879
I've had, like, eight dates
in the last month.

07:02.055 --> 07:05.047
Twelve, if you count the ones
who showed up and left.

07:05.725 --> 07:08.125
- I can't bring the nitrogen tank down.
- Why not?

07:08.295 --> 07:11.560
All right, let me restate that.
It's very heavy and I don't want to.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.500
- I'll help you.
- Thank you.

07:16.002 --> 07:18.562
Lift with your knees, not your back.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.796
Good night.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.904
You know what would be fun?

07:25.078 --> 07:28.912
- Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
- Yeah, right.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.141
No, think about it.
We make it an experiment.

07:31.318 --> 07:35.118
Like when Frankenstein's monster
was lonely and he found a wife.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.920
He didn't find a wife.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.992
They built him a wife
out of dead body parts.

07:42.429 --> 07:44.090
Okay, we'll call that plan B.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.701
Coming.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.133
Damn you, you rat bastard.

07:58.778 --> 07:59.938
Are you drunk?

08:00.113 --> 08:03.514
Zack was a perfectly nice guy
and then you ruined him.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.275
How did I ruin him?

08:05.452 --> 08:09.821
Because in the olden days,
I never would've known he was so stupid.

08:12.892 --> 08:15.793
- Come on, he wasn't that stupid.
- Yes, he was.

08:15.962 --> 08:19.125
He thought you were
gonna blow up the moon.

08:19.632 --> 08:22.294
Okay, yeah, he's stupid. Heh, heh.

08:22.469 --> 08:23.800
He spent the entire night...

08:23.970 --> 08:28.304
...bragging about how he invented
the word "appeteasers."

08:31.578 --> 08:33.135
How is that my fault?

08:33.313 --> 08:36.077
You have destroyed my ability
to tolerate idiots.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.477
Now, come with me.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.880
- Where are we going?
- We're gonna have sex.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.647
Why? I mean, okay.

08:44.758 --> 08:45.816
What's going on?

08:46.159 --> 08:49.822
Put on your noise-canceling headphones,
because it's gonna get loud.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.224
Ugh. Not this again.

09:08.415 --> 09:12.044
In what universe is this "low-pulp"?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.348
Good morning, Penny.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.020
Do you have eyes
in the back of your head?

09:19.192 --> 09:21.626
When one gets beaten up
every other day in school...

09:21.795 --> 09:24.855
...one, of necessity,
develops a keen sense of hearing.

09:26.032 --> 09:28.193
Incidentally, one can get beaten up
in school...

09:28.368 --> 09:31.235
...simply
by referring to oneself as "one."

09:32.372 --> 09:35.535
I'm making English muffins.
Would you like an English muffin?

09:35.708 --> 09:36.936
Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.

09:37.110 --> 09:41.547
FYI, my noise-canceling headphones
proved ineffective last night.

09:42.982 --> 09:45.644
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- As a native Texan, I must say...

09:45.819 --> 09:49.255
...I've never heard the phrase "yeehaw"
used in quite that context.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.087
Oh, God.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.623
"Oh, God."

09:54.794 --> 09:57.558
That I've heard on multiple occasions.

10:01.801 --> 10:05.635
In what universe is that "lightly toasted"?

10:08.641 --> 10:11.132
This has to be the worst day of my life.

10:12.912 --> 10:14.573
Good morning, Leonard.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.942
How many times
have I asked you not to do that?

10:17.417 --> 10:20.318
Counting this instance?
Three hundred seventeen.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.988
- Where's Penny?
- She returned to her apartment.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.126
I presume to shower and vomit.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.921
Not necessarily in that order.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.093
Wonder why she didn't say goodbye.

10:32.932 --> 10:36.766
Are you expecting me to offer
an explanation of human behavior?

10:36.936 --> 10:38.528
I know. I thought as an outsider...

10:38.705 --> 10:41.173
...you might be able to provide
a fresh perspective.

10:45.445 --> 10:49.108
Well, I have no difficulty
believing you are not butter.

10:52.619 --> 10:53.984
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, hi.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.783
- I gotta run. Early shift.
- Okay, I'll walk down with you.

10:57.957 --> 10:59.891
So last night was fun, huh?

11:00.059 --> 11:03.722
Yeah, it must've been.
I just threw up in my closet.

11:04.464 --> 11:05.488
Bummer.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.065
I was thinking tonight
maybe we could catch a movie.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.327
Oh, yeah, tonight's not great for me.

11:10.503 --> 11:14.303
Doesn't have to be tonight.
I'm free pretty much always.

11:14.807 --> 11:17.139
Leonard, last night was a mistake.

11:17.577 --> 11:20.239
When you say "mistake,"
do you mean a fortunate mistake...

11:20.413 --> 11:23.143
...like the discovery of penicillin?

11:23.816 --> 11:24.840
Look, I'm sorry.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.646
I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.549
Can we just forget it ever happened?

11:29.722 --> 11:32.816
No, it's pretty well imprinted on my brain.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.823
Especially the whole rodeo thing.

11:34.994 --> 11:36.655
Oh, God.

11:36.829 --> 11:39.354
So that's it?
Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?

11:39.532 --> 11:42.000
Look, I said I'm sorry.
Can't you please let it go?

11:42.168 --> 11:45.331
How am I supposed to let it go?
You used me for sex.

11:49.742 --> 11:51.004
Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.

11:51.177 --> 11:55.910
Good morning, Leonard.
Or should I say "yeehaw"

12:03.256 --> 12:05.417
- Holy crap.
- What?

12:05.592 --> 12:06.854
We finally have proof...

12:07.026 --> 12:10.689
- ...that aliens walk among us.
- Excuse me?

12:10.863 --> 12:13.525
The dating site
matched a woman with Sheldon.

12:14.033 --> 12:16.126
You're kidding. An actual woman?

12:16.302 --> 12:19.430
Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.

12:19.772 --> 12:22.866
Trust me, breasts doesn't
necessarily mean "woman."

12:23.042 --> 12:24.907
- Since when?
- I'll show you a picture...

12:25.078 --> 12:27.911
...of my Uncle Louie
in a bathing suit sometime.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.547
Leonard, you gotta see this.
We found a match for Sheldon.

12:33.720 --> 12:37.315
Great. Maybe she can have sex with him
and walk out on him the next morning...

12:37.490 --> 12:40.220
...without so much
as a "How do you do?"

12:40.760 --> 12:42.921
- Know what he's talking about?
- No. Ask him.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.223
- Leonard, what?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.628
That was a lousy suggestion.

12:47.800 --> 12:48.824
Whatever.

12:49.002 --> 12:53.962
Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper
has to send an e-mail to his perfect match.

12:54.140 --> 12:58.406
"Greetings, fellow life-form..."

13:00.313 --> 13:03.111
If she can do it, I can do it.
If she can do it, I can do it.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.080
If she can do it, I can do it.

13:06.352 --> 13:07.410
I can't do it.

13:09.255 --> 13:11.485
- Hello?
- Oh, hi. Hey.

13:11.658 --> 13:12.818
Hi, Leslie.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.258
Leonard, what're you doing here?

13:16.829 --> 13:18.592
I know. It's been a while.

13:18.765 --> 13:19.959
Yeah, 18 months.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.330
Right. Right.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.260
So how you doing?

13:26.005 --> 13:28.940
- Fine. You?
- Not bad.

13:29.108 --> 13:31.542
You remember
when we used to have sex...

13:31.711 --> 13:34.509
...and you said it didn't mean anything,
it was just for fun?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.304
Yeah.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.780
Do you wanna do that again?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.447
What happened? Blondie dumped you?

13:42.622 --> 13:46.023
She didn't dump me. We were
just in different places in the relationship.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.448
Right.

13:48.227 --> 13:52.323
Anyway, apparently, it's okay to go back
to people you're no longer seeing...

13:52.498 --> 13:55.467
- ...and have recreational sex with them.
- Uh-huh.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.202
So, what do you say?

13:58.971 --> 14:00.836
Let me think about it.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.647
She's not coming back.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.917
- Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.
- Not us. Him.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.684
Yes, but "him"
doesn't even know about "her."

14:20.159 --> 14:22.821
Well, "him" about to find out about "her."

14:23.162 --> 14:25.596
Really? Us gonna tell him?

14:25.765 --> 14:27.824
Who's going to tell whom about what?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.900
Sheldon. Hey. Hi.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.828
Your surprise confuses me. I live here.

14:35.274 --> 14:36.332
Right.

14:36.509 --> 14:40.036
So, listen, what are you doing
tomorrow afternoon?

14:40.213 --> 14:42.681
- Be more specific.
- Four-thirty.

14:42.849 --> 14:45.374
That's not afternoon. That's preevning.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.944
- What?
- It's a time of day I invented.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.454
It better defines the ambiguous period...

14:51.624 --> 14:55.025
...between afternoon and evening:
preevning.

14:55.194 --> 14:58.755
Fairly certain it will catch on
as it fills a desperate need.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.859
Right, okay. What are you doing
tomorrow preevning?

15:02.034 --> 15:05.800
Well, tomorrow's Saturday.
Saturday night is laundry night.

15:05.972 --> 15:10.705
So I'll be spending the preevning
pre-sorting and pre-soaking.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.811
Okay, what if I were to tell you...

15:12.979 --> 15:15.106
...tomorrow at 4:30,
you could meet a woman...

15:15.281 --> 15:18.876
...who has been scientifically chosen
to be your perfect mate?

15:19.452 --> 15:22.216
I would snort in derision
and throw my arms in the air...

15:22.388 --> 15:25.551
...exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.

15:26.058 --> 15:27.457
But it's true.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.459
We put all your vital information
into this dating site...

15:33.633 --> 15:36.966
...answered all questions like you would
and they found a match for you.

15:37.136 --> 15:40.264
- Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.
- Please.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.307
Even assuming you could answer
any question the way I would...

15:43.476 --> 15:46.411
...the algorithms used
by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.513
That's the answer
we gave to the question.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.774
"What is your attitude
towards online dating?"

15:51.250 --> 15:54.583
Well, Howard wanted to write
"mumbo jumbo," but I said no.

15:54.754 --> 15:58.087
Our Sheldon would say "hokum."

16:00.593 --> 16:02.823
Come on,
where's your scientific curiosity?

16:02.995 --> 16:05.930
Most of it is being applied to unraveling
secrets of universe...

16:06.098 --> 16:09.693
...while the rest of it is wondering why
I'm having this conversation with you.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.427
Okay, how about this?

16:11.604 --> 16:14.937
Even Spock had a date
once every seven years,

16:15.107 --> 16:17.200
He didn't date. It was pon farr.

16:17.376 --> 16:19.810
His blood boiled with mating lust.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.681
Why don't you start
with a cup of coffee...

16:22.849 --> 16:26.114
...and you can pon farr
Amy Farrah Fowler later.

16:26.719 --> 16:29.654
- I don't drink coffee.
- All right, you can have a hot chocolate.

16:29.822 --> 16:33.622
As I will not be engaging in this nonsense,
my choice of beverage is moot.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.818
For the record,
I only drink hot chocolate...

16:35.995 --> 16:38.122
...in months with an R in them.

16:39.131 --> 16:42.191
- Why?
- What's life without whimsy?

16:45.137 --> 16:46.297
Okay, I'm out.

16:52.144 --> 16:53.907
Sheldon...

16:54.080 --> 16:57.538
...I've hidden the dirty sock from the roof
somewhere in your apartment.

16:59.986 --> 17:02.045
Unless you're willing
to come with us to meet this girl...

17:02.221 --> 17:05.384
...it will remain there forever.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.017
You're bluffing.

17:09.095 --> 17:11.063
Are you willing to risk it?

17:12.732 --> 17:14.358
Curse you.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.047
Thirty feet.

17:46.132 --> 17:47.531
Oh. Hey, Leonard.

17:47.700 --> 17:51.932
I was a perfectly happy,
geeky, little lonely guy...

17:52.104 --> 17:54.038
...and then you ruined me.

17:54.874 --> 17:55.863
Are you drunk?

17:56.042 --> 17:59.034
Come on. We're gonna have sex
and it's not gonna mean a thing.

18:00.112 --> 18:02.410
Are you out of your mind?

18:04.917 --> 18:08.216
I'm really starting to think
there's a double standard here.

18:13.392 --> 18:17.294
In a few minutes, when I gloat
over the failure of this enterprise...

18:17.463 --> 18:20.557
...how would you prefer I do it?
The standard "I told you so"?

18:20.733 --> 18:22.064
With a classic "neener-neener"?

18:22.234 --> 18:25.670
Or just my normal look
of haughty derision?

18:27.406 --> 18:31.069
- You don't know we're wrong yet.
- Haughty derision it is.

18:32.244 --> 18:35.805
Excuse me. I'm Amy Farrah Fowler.
You're Sheldon Cooper.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.677
Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.410
I'm sorry to inform you
that you have been taken in...

18:40.586 --> 18:42.144
...by unsupportable mathematics...

18:42.321 --> 18:44.653
...designed to prey
on the gullible and the lonely.

18:44.824 --> 18:48.760
Additionally, I'm being blackmailed
with a hidden dirty sock.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.760
If that was slang, I'm unfamiliar with it.

18:53.165 --> 18:56.601
If it was literal,
I share your aversion to soiled hosiery.

18:58.270 --> 19:02.331
I'm here because my mother and I have
agreed that I will date at least once a year.

19:02.508 --> 19:03.532
Interesting.

19:03.709 --> 19:07.008
My mother and I have
the same agreement about church.

19:07.179 --> 19:10.615
I don't object to the concept of a deity,
but I'm baffled by the notion...

19:10.783 --> 19:12.478
...of one that takes attendance.

19:13.619 --> 19:16.281
Well, then you might
want to avoid East Texas.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.982
Noted. Now, before this goes any further,
you should know...

19:20.159 --> 19:24.619
...that all forms of physical contact
up to and including coitus are off the table.

19:26.632 --> 19:28.827
May I buy you a beverage?

19:30.136 --> 19:31.967
Tepid water, please.

19:40.312 --> 19:42.473
Good God, what have we done?
