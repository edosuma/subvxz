00:00.928 --> 00:03.150
Kids, you remember
my first day with Robin.

00:03.490 --> 00:05.717
- I think I'm in love with you.
- What?!

00:06.132 --> 00:09.541
Well, here's the thing, normal people,
you know, people who aren't your dad,

00:09.541 --> 00:12.216
usually take longer to say "I love you."

00:12.436 --> 00:14.404
Robin went through the usual stages.

00:15.805 --> 00:18.370
- Spider! Spider!
- I left something in the hallway.

00:19.240 --> 00:20.449
- Where?
- Right there.

00:21.650 --> 00:22.249
Got it.

00:22.249 --> 00:24.686
First there's the moment
when you think you think it.

00:24.686 --> 00:26.080
Whoa, still alive.

00:27.703 --> 00:30.151
There's the moment
you think you know it.

00:30.407 --> 00:32.803
Oh, you don't want to kiss me,
you'll get sick.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:41.259 --> 00:42.562
Totally worth it.

00:44.169 --> 00:47.483
There's the moment where you know
you know it,  but you can't yet say it.

00:47.535 --> 00:50.350
All right, it's getting to be that time.
I'll talk to you tomorrow?

00:50.758 --> 00:51.732
Good night.

00:52.165 --> 00:53.173
Good night.

00:54.058 --> 00:55.352
Wait, Ted?

00:55.358 --> 00:56.192
Yeah?

00:58.815 --> 00:59.921
Good night.

01:02.708 --> 01:04.280
Well, great, I'll see you then.

01:04.385 --> 01:05.630
Bye, sweetie.

01:05.667 --> 01:07.023
Hey. Guess what?

01:07.028 --> 01:09.000
My sister Katie is coming
to visit next weekend.

01:09.008 --> 01:10.220
She gets in on Thursday.

01:10.228 --> 01:12.000
That's awesome.
You know what I'm going to do?

01:12.005 --> 01:13.203
I'm going to take off work Friday.

01:13.208 --> 01:15.072
We're gonna take her
to the Empire State Building.

01:15.167 --> 01:17.232
Really? You'd do that?

01:17.285 --> 01:20.231
Of course. Everyone should see
the Empire State Building.

01:21.007 --> 01:23.713
And then there's the moment
where you know you know it,

01:23.715 --> 01:25.733
and you can't keep it in any longer.

01:25.788 --> 01:27.321
- Ted. 
- Yeah?

01:29.398 --> 01:30.670
Falafel.

01:49.306 --> 01:51.202
- Falafel?
- Falafel.

01:51.396 --> 01:54.621
Instead of telling Ted you love him,
you said "falafel"?

01:54.625 --> 01:57.263
- I totally choked.
- I just don't get it.

01:57.408 --> 01:59.602
Why can't you tell Ted you love him?

01:59.605 --> 02:01.480
Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.

02:01.486 --> 02:05.053
Oh, God, you'd think you never
said it to a guy before.

02:06.845 --> 02:07.693
No.

02:07.698 --> 02:10.651
Okay, well, I don't usually get
this far in the relationship.

02:10.657 --> 02:12.663
I usually take the three-week exit.

02:12.667 --> 02:16.312
Don't tell me you're actually buying
into Barney's freeway theory.

02:16.545 --> 02:20.672
Watch your steps when you get up, kids,
'cause I am about to drop some knowledge.

02:20.718 --> 02:22.722
Relationships are like a freeway.

02:22.728 --> 02:26.362
Wait a minute, a month ago you told me
relationships are like a traveling circus.

02:26.518 --> 02:28.350
No, this is new.
This trumps that.

02:28.657 --> 02:31.282
Freeways have exits.
So do relationships.

02:31.358 --> 02:34.030
The first exit, my personal favorite,
is six hours in.

02:34.035 --> 02:36.920
You meet, you talk, you have sex,
you exit when she's in the shower.

02:36.938 --> 02:40.703
So every girl you have sex with feels
the immediate need to shower?

02:41.007 --> 02:42.820
Actually, yeah, I get that.

02:43.386 --> 02:47.110
The next exits are four days,
three weeks, seven months--

02:47.116 --> 02:48.973
that's when you guys are gonna
break up, mark your calendars.

02:48.978 --> 02:49.693
What?

02:49.698 --> 02:53.452
Then a year and a half, 18 years,
and the last exit-- death.

02:53.456 --> 02:55.530
Which, if you've been with the same woman
for your entire life,

02:55.538 --> 02:57.920
it's like, "Are we there yet?"

02:58.478 --> 03:01.483
So I've never been on the freeway
this long before.

03:01.486 --> 03:04.990
I mean, usually by now I find out
the guy has some weird personality thing

03:04.996 --> 03:06.680
that makes me want
to take the next exit.

03:06.685 --> 03:07.833
Yeah, been there.

03:07.838 --> 03:13.221
I once dated a guy who could only go to
the bathroom when classical music was playing.

03:13.408 --> 03:15.082
Okay, it was Marshall.

03:16.065 --> 03:20.371
It's just things are going so well with
Ted I just don't want to complicate it.

03:20.378 --> 03:22.770
Relax, it'll happen when it happens.

03:22.825 --> 03:27.411
Which is also the advice I gave Marshall
to get him over the classical music thing.

03:28.218 --> 03:29.770
Oh, here comes Katie.

03:30.808 --> 03:33.892
- Aw, your sister's so cute.
- Yeah.

03:33.908 --> 03:38.051
This reminds me of when I used to see
her coming up the driveway from school,

03:38.058 --> 03:41.452
with her little pigtails
and her Hello Kitty backpack.

03:43.276 --> 03:45.590
- Hello, Kitty.
- Oh, no.

03:45.905 --> 03:48.000
No. No. No.

03:49.225 --> 03:53.681
- Hey, Robin. How are you?
- Oh, good. Good.

03:54.455 --> 03:58.693
So, who is this... tongue person?

03:58.787 --> 04:01.030
Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle.

04:01.768 --> 04:04.191
Looks like hotness runs in the family.

04:04.198 --> 04:07.451
Oh,  you said that.
Great.

04:08.075 --> 04:09.853
So how long have you two been...?

04:09.855 --> 04:11.211
- Two whole months.
- Yeah.

04:11.306 --> 04:13.552
He's actually coming to visit
family in New York, too.

04:13.558 --> 04:14.642
Isn't that great?

04:14.806 --> 04:18.723
My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad,
but he buys me beer, so...

04:19.107 --> 04:21.790
That's cool.
This is my friend Lily.

04:22.237 --> 04:23.253
Hot.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.931
You say things!

04:26.205 --> 04:29.071
Well, come on, let's get you back
to my place, we'll get you settled.

04:29.077 --> 04:31.382
Um, actually, I'm going
to stay with Kyle tonight.

04:31.388 --> 04:33.400
- Uh, no, you're not.
- Oh, come on.

04:33.466 --> 04:36.312
It's kind of a special night.

04:36.318 --> 04:37.642
If you know what I mean.

04:38.295 --> 04:39.380
What?

04:40.187 --> 04:41.712
Oh. Oh...

04:45.516 --> 04:49.521
I can't believe my baby sister is planning
to lose her virginity to a...

04:49.526 --> 04:51.622
...douche with a faux hawk.

04:51.906 --> 04:53.360
This can't happen.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.673
You guys have to help me
talk her out of it.

04:55.906 --> 04:58.892
Speech to talk a girl out of having sex.

04:58.898 --> 05:00.630
Yeah, I don't have any of those.

05:00.685 --> 05:03.563
Discouraging premarital sex
is against my religion.

05:03.605 --> 05:05.693
Please? I'm her older sister.

05:05.696 --> 05:09.360
I'm supposed to teach her how to make
good and responsible decisions.

05:09.526 --> 05:13.003
It's 2:00 and you've already
had three scotch and sodas.

05:13.038 --> 05:14.821
That's why I need your help.

05:17.208 --> 05:19.880
Robin convinced Katie to stay with her
that first night.

05:19.928 --> 05:22.803
And the next day, I took everybody
to the Empire State Building.

05:22.858 --> 05:24.920
You guys are lucky
you came here with an architect.

05:24.928 --> 05:26.712
Empire State Building fun
fact number one:

05:26.718 --> 05:29.280
When construction began
on March 17, 1930,

05:29.287 --> 05:32.431
the framework rose at a rate
of four and a half stories per week.

05:33.447 --> 05:35.181
Four and a half stories per week.

05:36.408 --> 05:38.342
Four and a half stories per week.

05:38.446 --> 05:40.952
There it is.
There it is. Come on.

05:40.955 --> 05:43.723
These are fun facts, guys,
let's have fun with them.

05:44.578 --> 05:48.802
You know, Katie, I have wanted to come
to the Empire State Building for so long,

05:48.806 --> 05:51.510
but I waited to come here
with someone special.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.120
Oh, here we go.

05:53.226 --> 05:56.763
Marshall and I have never been to
the Empire State Building either.

05:56.765 --> 06:01.411
But I'm so glad I waited to do something
so important with my fiancÃ©.

06:01.615 --> 06:04.851
Speaking of waiting, I signed 
an abstinence pledge in high school.

06:04.856 --> 06:06.590
It's totally cool to wait.

06:06.655 --> 06:09.660
And stay away from drugs...
other than pot.

06:10.657 --> 06:12.960
- You told them?
- Oh, okay, yes, I told them.

06:13.007 --> 06:16.071
But only because I think you should
hear it from other grownups, too.

06:16.108 --> 06:18.453
Everyone thinks you should wait.
Right, guys?

06:18.455 --> 06:20.350
-  Totally. You should wait.
- Sex is fun.

06:21.106 --> 06:22.110
See?

06:22.115 --> 06:25.131
You are such a hypocrite.
You were only 16 when you lost yours.

06:25.136 --> 06:26.400
Well, how do you know that?

06:26.408 --> 06:28.860
You  left your diary in your old room
slash my new room.

06:28.866 --> 06:31.101
I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary.

06:32.346 --> 06:34.513
Look, I've been dating Kyle
for two months now.

06:34.605 --> 06:35.881
It's like forever.

06:35.988 --> 06:38.320
I mean, we've already done
everything else.

06:38.326 --> 06:40.602
- I mean, we've even...
- Oh. La, la, la, la, la.

06:40.666 --> 06:44.590
La, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.370
Even Kyle gets to do that.

06:48.906 --> 06:51.102
You have no right to tell me
not to do it.

06:51.108 --> 06:53.431
But Kyle?
Why can't you just wait?

06:53.437 --> 06:56.581
Because if you wait,
you can get a nice guy like Ted.

06:56.748 --> 06:59.050
Robin, this is happening.

06:59.466 --> 07:02.190
Look, I already put it up
on my Myspace page.

07:03.183 --> 07:05.601
- I need a clove.
- You smoke now, too?

07:05.627 --> 07:07.873
- Oh, remember cloves?
- No!

07:08.009 --> 07:11.122
No "Aw, remember cloves?"
This can't happen.

07:11.209 --> 07:12.851
She's my baby sister, okay?

07:12.855 --> 07:17.753
She should be watching The Little Mermaid
and drinking Yoohoo, and not having sex.

07:17.907 --> 07:19.881
Come on, you were only 16
when you had sex.

07:19.887 --> 07:21.752
- I was 17.
- We were 18.

07:21.755 --> 07:23.502
Barney was probably 12.

07:23.666 --> 07:25.560
Good one, Ted.

07:25.806 --> 07:28.960
I was, uh, six... fourt...

07:29.205 --> 07:30.561
How old were you again?

07:31.065 --> 07:33.222
- 17.
- Dude, me, too.

07:33.815 --> 07:36.073
- Barney, you okay?
- Yeah, of course.

07:36.288 --> 07:37.481
What, you don't believe me?

07:37.486 --> 07:39.760
- It was at camp, so I'm...
- What camp?

07:39.856 --> 07:42.183
This place in the Catskills.
Look it up.

07:42.906 --> 07:45.151
I was there teaching for the summer.

07:45.756 --> 07:47.110
What did you teach?

07:47.218 --> 07:49.053
Uh, dance.

07:49.106 --> 07:50.200
Dance?

07:50.228 --> 07:52.720
Yeah, Ted, dance.
Maybe you've heard of it.

07:53.447 --> 07:57.852
It was just a simple summer job,
but it turned into so much more.

07:58.708 --> 08:02.580
Her name was Frances Houseman,
but everyone called her Baby.

08:02.588 --> 08:03.721
# Sylvia #

08:03.726 --> 08:05.163
# Yes, Mickey? #

08:05.165 --> 08:07.370
# How you call your loverboy? #

08:07.925 --> 08:09.763
# Come here, loverboy #

08:09.907 --> 08:11.711
# And if he doesn't answer #

08:11.717 --> 08:13.281
# Oh, loverboy #

08:13.455 --> 08:15.451
# And if he still doesn't answer? #

08:15.458 --> 08:19.232
# I simply say, baby... #

08:19.778 --> 08:22.840
# Oh, baby #

08:23.608 --> 08:27.000
# My sweet baby #

08:27.407 --> 08:29.203
That's Dirty Dancing.

08:29.306 --> 08:31.502
- It was on last night.
- No, it was two nights ago.

08:31.506 --> 08:34.001
"She's Like the Wind" has been stuck
in my brain for about 40 hours.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.792
I just got it out.
Now it's back in.

08:36.256 --> 08:38.049
Damn you, Swayze!

08:39.837 --> 08:42.539
- Do you remember our first time?
- Yeah.

08:43.158 --> 08:44.811
It was back in college.

08:46.005 --> 08:47.443
Oh, wait, wait. 

08:47.448 --> 08:50.662
Look... I really want to do this, but...

08:50.728 --> 08:53.213
we should make it special, you know?

08:53.215 --> 08:54.481
Do this right.

08:57.907 --> 08:58.703
Okay.

08:58.928 --> 08:59.941
You're right.

08:59.986 --> 09:03.343
Maybe we could go to the beach
and get a house for the weekend.

09:03.345 --> 09:05.710
Yeah, New Year's Eve.

09:06.065 --> 09:07.291
Okay.

09:08.226 --> 09:13.341
Oh, and we'll light candles and
maybe put on some classical music.

09:13.346 --> 09:14.872
That's not a good idea.

09:15.335 --> 09:16.300
Why not?

09:16.336 --> 09:17.842
Long story.

09:18.007 --> 09:21.011
But maybe we could put on some Al Green
and take a bubble bath together.

09:21.016 --> 09:23.760
Oh, yeah, that sounds so good.

09:24.595 --> 09:26.221
Oh, I love you, Marshall.

09:26.327 --> 09:28.713
I'm so glad we're waiting.

09:31.556 --> 09:32.641
Oops.

09:33.846 --> 09:37.082
- Oh, that's adorable.
- Yeah, tell her what happened next.

09:37.705 --> 09:39.780
- That was amazing.
- Yeah.

09:40.088 --> 09:41.580
Want to do it again?

09:41.656 --> 09:42.981
Please don't.

09:45.106 --> 09:47.901
- We said we were sorry.
- Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?

09:47.906 --> 09:50.072
You know what, I loaned you my Walkman.

09:50.075 --> 09:55.190
The  point is no matter what, it's never
gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.

09:55.197 --> 09:56.471
Well, mine was terrible.

09:56.475 --> 09:58.601
Wait, I've never heard your story.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.280
Well, as you know, I was 16.

10:02.405 --> 10:05.041
And it was with my boyfriend Brian.

10:08.325 --> 10:10.670
- Ready?
- Yeah.

10:12.955 --> 10:15.683
- This feels so right.
- Oh, I know.

10:15.686 --> 10:18.431
- Oh, Robin.
- Oh, Brian.

10:21.006 --> 10:22.911
Yeah, I'm gay.

10:24.817 --> 10:28.350
- I'm so sorry.
- Eh, I should've known.

10:29.007 --> 10:30.542
There were signs.

10:31.507 --> 10:32.373
Oh, my God!

10:32.378 --> 10:33.900
My mom's home.
Quick!

10:33.905 --> 10:35.691
- Get under my bed.
- What?!

10:36.896 --> 10:38.600
Oh, my God!

10:40.158 --> 10:43.120
You only get one shot
at losing your virginity.

10:43.217 --> 10:45.991
And even though I just barely had sex,
it counts.

10:46.056 --> 10:47.861
What do you mean just barely?

10:47.907 --> 10:51.790
Well, he didn't dive all
the way into the pool, but he...

10:51.795 --> 10:54.372
splashed around in the shallow end.

10:55.175 --> 10:57.773
Then you didn't lose
your virginity to him.

10:57.777 --> 11:00.372
- Just barely doesn't count.
- Yes, it does.

11:00.377 --> 11:01.591
- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.

11:01.596 --> 11:04.701
No, it doesn't. It doesn't count.
End of story.

11:04.797 --> 11:08.842
Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin,
you saucy little harlot.

11:08.845 --> 11:13.773
Could it be that before Marshall took
a swim, someone else tested the water?

11:13.906 --> 11:17.681
No. Nobody else tested the water, right?

11:19.265 --> 11:20.413
Scooter?

11:20.625 --> 11:21.510
Who's Scooter?

11:21.516 --> 11:24.072
My high school boyfriend,
who I did not have sex with.

11:24.078 --> 11:26.622
I... I can't believe this.

11:26.755 --> 11:29.041
We're Marshall and Lily--
when people see us, they say,

11:29.047 --> 11:32.223
"Oh, look at them, they've only
had sex with each other."

11:32.268 --> 11:34.902
No, Marshall, they say,
"Oh, look at them,

11:34.926 --> 11:37.221
they've only had sex with each other."

11:37.327 --> 11:39.561
But now that's not true anymore--

11:39.606 --> 11:42.661
now you've had sex with twice
as many people as I have.

11:42.867 --> 11:44.921
I knew that you were too good at it.

11:45.007 --> 11:48.001
Know what? I don't want to see
the stupid Empire State Building anymore.

11:48.068 --> 11:50.860
- It's not stupid.
- I'm going to see Kyle.

11:50.905 --> 11:54.510
Katie, please.
You only get to lose your virginity once.

11:54.588 --> 11:57.011
You should only be having sex
with someone who's special.

11:57.095 --> 11:59.702
Oh, please-- you've had sex with,
like, a hundred guys.

11:59.726 --> 12:03.002
It's not a hundred guys.
It's not a hundred guys.

12:03.248 --> 12:05.622
I'm sure you were madly
in love with all of them.

12:05.716 --> 12:08.882
I had different levels of feeling
for each of the...

12:08.887 --> 12:11.002
very reasonable number of guys.

12:11.687 --> 12:12.752
Really.

12:13.125 --> 12:14.712
Well, do you love Ted?

12:21.208 --> 12:22.882
Do you love Ted ?

12:24.505 --> 12:25.013
I, um... 

12:25.016 --> 12:27.922
Okay, Empire State Building
fun fact number 22:

12:27.926 --> 12:32.242
The Empire State Building has tons of places
where people can have private conversations.

12:32.706 --> 12:35.132
- You're off the hook, okay?
- Just let me explain.

12:35.166 --> 12:38.680
You don't have to explain anything.
You don't have to say it-- it's fine.

12:38.756 --> 12:43.381
Okay, but if relationships are
like a freeway, then saying...

12:43.875 --> 12:47.913
"hm hm hm" is like... 
getting into the carpool lane.

12:48.006 --> 12:50.670
And I don't want to take an exit, but...

12:50.995 --> 12:53.770
at the same time, I'm not ready
to get into the carpool lane.

12:53.777 --> 12:55.511
Because what's in the carpool lane?

12:55.517 --> 12:58.591
Oh, it's a big diamond,
and I'm just not ready to get...

12:58.608 --> 13:00.391
Okay, Robin, Robin, stop.

13:00.597 --> 13:02.990
It's no big deal--
you don't have to say it.

13:03.056 --> 13:07.310
It's just, it's a big thing to say to
someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.

13:07.608 --> 13:08.970
What, you mean like I did?

13:09.006 --> 13:10.513
No.  I didn't...

13:11.358 --> 13:12.862
Yeah, like you did.

13:13.888 --> 13:17.363
I mean, you have to admit it,
Ted, it was a little weird.

13:17.817 --> 13:21.181
- Weird... or courageous?
- Pretty sure weird. 

13:22.207 --> 13:24.312
I mean, who gives it up
on the first date?

13:24.325 --> 13:26.603
Well, come on, it shows I'm brave
and bold, like a knight.

13:26.656 --> 13:29.100
No, it shows that
you're an I-love-you slut.

13:29.286 --> 13:31.122
Well, then you're an I-love-you prude.

13:31.168 --> 13:32.720
You know what?
I take mine back.

13:32.808 --> 13:34.301
- You... What?
- I take my "I love you" back.

13:34.328 --> 13:36.943
- You can't take it back.
- Nah. Just did. Got it right here.

13:37.008 --> 13:39.110
But, you know, I'm such a slut,
I'm just gonna give it away.

13:39.206 --> 13:41.231
Hey, you, sir. I love you.

13:41.787 --> 13:42.963
Thank you, man.

13:43.207 --> 13:45.090
I was going up there to jump.

13:49.035 --> 13:51.311
Marshall, why is this such a big deal?

13:51.428 --> 13:53.722
Why is this such a big deal?

13:53.807 --> 13:57.422
Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus,
guess who actually discovered the New World.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.932
Some dude named Scooter.

14:00.086 --> 14:02.303
Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong,
it actually goes like this:

14:02.357 --> 14:06.342
"One small step for man,
one giant leap for Scooter."

14:06.415 --> 14:08.513
Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve

14:08.518 --> 14:10.001
- before you did...
- Okay, Marshall, I get it.

14:10.045 --> 14:12.462
It's a big deal because
it rewrites our history.

14:12.478 --> 14:13.692
No, it doesn't.

14:13.738 --> 14:16.583
Look, have you been to
the Empire State Building?

14:16.608 --> 14:18.792
No. You've only been in the lobby.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.070
People don't buy tickets
to get in the lobby.

14:21.078 --> 14:23.403
They buy tickets to get to the top.

14:23.506 --> 14:26.773
Scooter only got in the lobby,
and the lobby doesn't count.

14:26.785 --> 14:27.703
Really.

14:27.755 --> 14:31.050
Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me
how to get to the Empire State Building?

14:31.156 --> 14:33.001
Um, we're in it right now.

14:33.086 --> 14:35.803
Thank you, sir.
You're a very wise and brilliant man.

14:36.607 --> 14:37.640
You're right.

14:37.827 --> 14:39.561
Why would I throw that all away?

14:40.257 --> 14:41.953
I'm having the best day!

14:43.366 --> 14:46.181
Katie, I'll admit,
maybe I'm not in any place

14:46.207 --> 14:49.401
to lecture you on romantic
relationships, but...

14:49.435 --> 14:52.673
but I just don't want you to make
the same mistakes that I've made.

14:53.708 --> 14:57.302
- Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay.
- That's not what I meant.

14:58.326 --> 15:01.372
I just wish you weren't
in such a rush to grow up.

15:02.805 --> 15:04.341
Please don't do this.

15:04.997 --> 15:08.882
But, kids, later that night,
Katie did it,

15:09.035 --> 15:12.801
and she got pregnant...
with quintuplets...

15:13.086 --> 15:15.902
and she lived out her days
in a trailer park...

15:16.405 --> 15:18.291
where she died an alcoholic.

15:18.478 --> 15:21.840
So the moral here, kids,
don't have sex until you're married.

15:21.905 --> 15:23.892
Maybe even, like,
a year or two into marriage.

15:24.007 --> 15:26.093
- Dad!
- Come on, what really happened?

15:26.157 --> 15:28.173
All right, here's what really happened.

15:28.206 --> 15:29.463
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:29.857 --> 15:31.071
She didn't do it.

15:31.168 --> 15:33.292
Hey, that's great!
You got through to her.

15:33.327 --> 15:35.722
No, I didn't. You did.

15:35.908 --> 15:37.700
She told me that you talked to her.

15:38.875 --> 15:39.751
Hey, Katie.

15:40.245 --> 15:41.280
Hey.

15:41.387 --> 15:44.201
Got another Empire State
Building fun fact for me?

15:44.355 --> 15:47.090
No. I wouldn't bore you
with the seven million man-hours

15:47.106 --> 15:50.462
it took to build this 102-story
testament to human will.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.023
So, you okay?

15:54.208 --> 15:56.373
I don't know what everyone
is freaking out about.

15:56.377 --> 15:58.731
Kyle, he's a really nice guy.

15:58.855 --> 16:02.101
He could've cheated on me with my lab
partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't.

16:02.188 --> 16:05.100
'Cause he said he knew I'd find out.

16:06.405 --> 16:07.861
That's very gallant.

16:08.518 --> 16:10.652
Well, I don't know what your sister's
freaking out about, either.

16:10.655 --> 16:12.802
- I was your age my first time.
- Oh, really?

16:12.847 --> 16:15.440
Yeah, yeah. It was, uh,
it was with this girl, Molly.

16:17.906 --> 16:19.090
I love you, Ted.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.441
Oh, I love you, too, Molly.

16:21.907 --> 16:23.851
But I didn't.

16:24.158 --> 16:25.953
That was amazing.

16:26.327 --> 16:27.850
Look, I got to go.

16:28.667 --> 16:30.252
Where are you going?

16:30.556 --> 16:33.052
My cousin got some firecrackers
from Mexico.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.333
We're going out to the woods to light 'em--
it's gonna be awesome.

16:35.405 --> 16:36.940
Well, will you call me?

16:37.485 --> 16:40.230
Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you.

16:40.287 --> 16:42.362
But I didn't.

16:44.508 --> 16:45.552
Molly?

16:45.908 --> 16:46.903
Yeah?

16:47.457 --> 16:49.663
Can I borrow 20 bucks?
I'll totally pay you back.

16:49.767 --> 16:51.621
But I didn't.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.733
And I never saw her again.

16:55.308 --> 16:58.283
I told her I loved her, but...
I just wanted to have sex.

16:58.327 --> 17:01.073
I-I would've said anything
to make that happen, and...

17:01.126 --> 17:02.892
that's exactly what I did.

17:05.096 --> 17:06.902
Look, I'm not telling you what to do.

17:07.377 --> 17:10.031
I'm just telling you what
all 17-year-old boys are like.

17:10.704 --> 17:12.200
Even the nice ones.

17:13.714 --> 17:18.472
So I told Kyle I wanted to wait...
and he dumped me.

17:18.606 --> 17:22.211
Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

17:23.407 --> 17:25.040
Aw, honey.

17:25.406 --> 17:28.329
I promise everything is gonna be okay.

17:33.106 --> 17:36.361
You want to watch The Little Mermaid
and drink some YooHoo?

17:37.487 --> 17:39.963
Only if you put a buttload
of Kahlua in it.

17:41.047 --> 17:42.252
Don't tell Mom.

17:44.836 --> 17:46.222
Thanks for doing that.

17:46.308 --> 17:48.892
You're welcome.
I knew it meant a lot to you.

17:49.017 --> 17:52.341
But, man, your story, I mean,
it doesn't even sound like you.

17:53.378 --> 17:54.762
Yeah, well...

17:57.687 --> 17:59.043
I love you, Molly.

17:59.145 --> 18:01.592
Oh, I love you, too, Ted.

18:02.766 --> 18:05.643
Wow. That was amazing.

18:06.046 --> 18:07.660
Look, I got to go.

18:08.406 --> 18:09.840
Wh-Where are you going?

18:09.905 --> 18:12.440
Uh, my cousin got
some firecrackers from Mexico.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.240
We're going into the woods
to light them.

18:14.305 --> 18:15.643
It's gonna be awesome.

18:16.006 --> 18:17.290
Will you call me? 

18:17.358 --> 18:19.431
Yeah. I'll totally call you.

18:21.106 --> 18:23.383
- Oh, Ted?
- Yeah?

18:24.005 --> 18:26.953
Can I borrow 20 bucks?
I'll totally pay you back.

18:28.335 --> 18:31.511
- But she didn't.
- Oh, come here.

18:37.278 --> 18:38.423
I love you.

18:41.857 --> 18:43.012
I said it.

18:44.807 --> 18:45.981
Feels right.

18:47.287 --> 18:49.010
-  I love you.
- I'm gay.

18:49.117 --> 18:50.931
I'm kidding.

18:51.766 --> 18:53.060
I love you, too.

18:56.808 --> 18:59.952
Hey... you lost
your I-love-you-ginity.

19:00.005 --> 19:01.123
Yeah.

19:01.605 --> 19:04.293
I guess I was just waiting
for the right guy.

19:10.506 --> 19:13.201
Katie ended up having
a great first time in New York.

19:13.307 --> 19:17.441
And the last thing we did before she left
was go to the Empire State Building.

19:17.567 --> 19:19.711
I am so glad we're finally doing this.

19:19.805 --> 19:21.290
What are you talking about?
We were here yesterday.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.873
Yeah, but that didn't really count.

19:24.038 --> 19:26.402
- Oh, crap.
- Exactly!

19:26.508 --> 19:30.643
So yesterday doesn't count as having
gone to the Empire State Building.

19:30.706 --> 19:33.082
So I lost it to you, Marshall.

19:33.156 --> 19:36.032
And I rode that elevator to the top,

19:36.105 --> 19:40.293
and I saw that view,
and I basked in the awesomeness.

19:40.297 --> 19:42.240
And that's our story.

19:42.345 --> 19:44.812
Yeah. Yeah, that's our story.

19:45.265 --> 19:46.981
We've only had sex with each other.

19:47.025 --> 19:49.061
We've only had sex with each other.

19:49.127 --> 19:51.402
They've only had sex with each other.

19:54.357 --> 19:56.341
Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go.

19:57.636 --> 20:00.242
Okay, Empire State Building
fun fact number 81:

20:00.307 --> 20:03.733
There are 1,860 steps from this...
Whoa, whoa! Come on!

20:09.465 --> 20:11.973
So, now you guys can finally say you've
been to the Empire State Building.

20:12.038 --> 20:14.401
How have you lived here so long
and never been to the top?

20:14.507 --> 20:17.752
Well, we're usually busy... drinking.

20:19.016 --> 20:21.520
Speaking of first times,
we never got to hear

20:21.528 --> 20:24.760
- your virginity story.
- That's right, I almost forgot.

20:25.225 --> 20:29.381
Okay. I was 16,
and it was in a baseball dugout...

20:29.417 --> 20:30.531
Fast Times at Ridgemont High.

20:30.536 --> 20:32.572
I mean, I was in a subway
with a high-priced call girl...

20:32.577 --> 20:33.361
Risky Business.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.582
I was accidentally hacking
into NORAD'S computer...

20:35.587 --> 20:37.813
That's War Games, and there's not even
a sex scene in it.

20:37.815 --> 20:39.161
All right!

20:40.358 --> 20:44.563
I was 23, and it was with my mom's
45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda.

20:44.608 --> 20:47.003
She called me "Barry" the whole time,
and for two weeks,

20:47.005 --> 20:50.210
my comforter smelled like menthol
cigarettes. You happy?

20:56.908 --> 20:57.942
Hey...

20:59.205 --> 21:02.903
Why don't you tell us again about your
first time at the camp in the Catskills.

21:04.296 --> 21:07.040
Baby and her family spent
every summer at Kellerman's.

21:07.046 --> 21:09.112
Her dad did not approve of our love.

21:09.308 --> 21:12.523
- Did anyone put Baby in a corner?
- Oh, God, no.

21:13.418 --> 21:15.322
What can I say, I...

21:15.508 --> 21:18.251
had... the time of my life.

21:18.915 --> 21:20.202
True story.
