Excellent.

40:31.124 --> 40:32.821
Do you like shawarma?

40:32.995 --> 40:34.214
I know the best
shawarma place.

40:34.388 --> 40:36.434
Oh, I love their chicken,

40:36.608 --> 40:38.653
but I hear their lamb is also
very good,

40:38.827 --> 40:39.959
though I don't eat lamb
anymore.

40:40.133 --> 40:41.047
It makes me sad.
