00:40.000 --> 00:42.001
Down, please.

00:54.527 --> 00:56.008
Oh, it's such a shame.

00:56.248 --> 00:59.239
All those toys stored away,
nobody to play with them.

00:59.290 --> 01:02.201
Anti-German feeling is running high,
Miss Calthorpe.

01:02.251 --> 01:06.803
It's store policy not to stock
anything German. Too old to play
with dolls, aren't you?

01:06.853 --> 01:11.885
It's not me I'm thinking of,
it's my sister Ruth. She doesn't have
many toys. Morning, Franco.

01:11.935 --> 01:15.327
Morning, Grace.
Seven, eight...

01:15.377 --> 01:18.169
The Rimmel mascara is
becoming popular, Jessie.

01:18.218 --> 01:20.220
I want to push it.
Yes, Miss Hawkins.

01:24.342 --> 01:28.774
I thought about going down
to Greenwich this weekend,
see the boats, have a meal.

01:28.823 --> 01:33.977
Would you like to come? I can't this
weekend. The next one, then?

01:34.027 --> 01:36.898
Do you not want to come with me?

01:36.947 --> 01:39.660
My father says
I mustn't go out with foreign boys.

01:39.709 --> 01:42.511
I'm really sorry, Franco,
but that's the way it is.

01:55.557 --> 01:58.279
Good morning, Miss Towler.
Morning, Mr Leclair.

02:07.083 --> 02:12.315
Look, Frank, the American government
shouldn't be trading with both
Germany and Britain.

02:12.365 --> 02:14.366
They're profiting from war.

02:15.126 --> 02:17.447
Can I quote you on that?
You certainly can.

02:19.569 --> 02:21.890
Good morning, Mr Edwards.
Mrs Selfridge.

02:23.610 --> 02:27.563
I'll write this up for tomorrow.
I appreciate it. Thanks, Frank.

02:27.613 --> 02:30.765
What's the matter?
Everyone's leaving London.

02:30.814 --> 02:32.805
Oh. Who's gone now?

02:32.855 --> 02:37.487
Hetty Madderson. Oh.
"Dear Rose, so sorry not to be able
to come to dine next week."

02:37.537 --> 02:42.820
Apparently the boats are crammed
with Americans. Don't they care how
bad it looks? Seems not.

02:46.062 --> 02:49.614
Good morning. Morning, Mr Selfridge.
Good morning, Mr Selfridge.

02:49.664 --> 02:52.695
Good morning. Good morning,
Mr Selfridge. Good morning.

02:52.745 --> 02:54.736
This is looking splendid.

02:54.786 --> 02:57.628
Pride in your department,
this is what I like to see.

02:59.068 --> 03:02.460
It's funny. Most of the time
I forget who you are.

03:02.510 --> 03:04.630
I mean, I think you're normal,
like me.

03:06.111 --> 03:09.424
I am normal.
You're Gordon Selfridge.

03:09.474 --> 03:11.474
You couldn't be normal if you tried.

03:15.676 --> 03:17.677
Good morning, sir.
Morning.

03:18.758 --> 03:20.878
Good morning, Mr Selfridge.
Morning.

03:21.920 --> 03:25.481
The heads of department are
waiting for you, Mr Selfridge.

03:27.923 --> 03:31.073
I wanna talk to you this morning
about stock. As you know,

03:31.124 --> 03:36.437
we've cleared German goods off
the shelves and replaced them as much
as we can with British goods.

03:36.486 --> 03:41.479
Some of you have done tremendously
well. Miss Hawkins, for example.
Thank you, Mr Selfridge.

03:41.529 --> 03:46.401
I'm pleased to say that Yardley
and Penhaligon's perfume are up
50 percent on last month.

03:46.451 --> 03:50.964
It's about encouraging the clients
to embrace new merchandise.

03:51.014 --> 03:53.855
Once they've tried something
they usually like it.

03:55.656 --> 03:59.247
Now if Miss Hawkins can do it in
beauty, the rest of you can as well.

03:59.297 --> 04:02.929
Oh, how are we progressing with
the plans for our patriotic concert?

04:02.979 --> 04:07.972
Well, Chief, although we're still
looking for our top-of-the-bill
singer. Keep me informed.

04:08.022 --> 04:12.544
Thank you all very much.
Oh, Miss Mardle, one moment, please.

04:18.747 --> 04:21.658
How do you think Gordon's doing?
Oh, very well.

04:21.708 --> 04:25.061
Mm, I'm pleased with him too.
Let's return Miss Calthorpe to you

04:25.110 --> 04:29.583
in Accessories and see if he can
stand on his own two feet. Very good.
One more thing.

04:29.633 --> 04:33.794
I understand that you've become
a woman of independent means.

04:34.755 --> 04:38.467
Well, yes, I have,
but that doesn't change anything.

04:38.517 --> 04:42.149
I'm still very committed to the
store. I'm more committed to you.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.600
The store wouldn't be the same
without you.

04:45.360 --> 04:50.913
I just wanted to say enjoy it.
Enjoy what? Your money. Oh.

04:50.963 --> 04:54.275
Your brother left it to you
because he wanted you to have it.

04:54.324 --> 04:58.477
Don't feel guilty.
Have fun with it. You deserve to.

04:58.526 --> 05:00.528
Thank you, Mr Selfridge.

05:15.936 --> 05:18.937
You've been receiving visitors.

05:23.059 --> 05:28.131
A young man involved with one of
my charities - This is not what
we talked about, Mae.

05:28.181 --> 05:32.573
I thought you understood.
I am now a man of standing.

05:32.623 --> 05:36.105
Nobody lays with my wife but me.

05:37.585 --> 05:39.587
Oh.

05:43.949 --> 05:46.140
Loxley, give that back to me.

05:46.190 --> 05:50.032
It is a man's right, by law,
to enter his wife's bedroom.

05:51.273 --> 05:53.313
You won't be requiring this anymore.

06:09.802 --> 06:12.993
Excuse me? Do you have
an appointment to see Mr Selfridge?

06:13.043 --> 06:15.045
He'll see me.

06:15.604 --> 06:18.796
Mr Selfridge, good morning.
Bill Summertime.

06:18.847 --> 06:23.008
We met at Miss Day's card party.
I work for His Majesty's Government.

06:23.728 --> 06:26.130
Oh. Have a seat, please.

06:29.131 --> 06:31.403
Did Lord Edgerton send you?

06:31.452 --> 06:33.453
I have nothing to do with Edgerton.

06:34.974 --> 06:38.535
No, I procure something
entirely different.

06:41.817 --> 06:43.498
Information.

06:44.578 --> 06:47.050
What do you mean?
Intelligence gathering.

06:47.100 --> 06:51.332
It's vital to the war effort
that we know what the enemy's up to.

06:51.382 --> 06:54.974
You're winding down your supplies
in Germany, aren't you? Yes.

06:55.024 --> 06:58.136
It would be a good time for
you to take a little...

06:58.185 --> 07:00.416
business trip over there.

07:00.466 --> 07:03.508
There are persons of interest
we'd like you to contact.

07:04.468 --> 07:08.260
But... How would a trip to Germany
come across to the British public?

07:08.310 --> 07:10.501
I have a reputation to maintain.

07:10.551 --> 07:12.872
And we have
the resources to keep it quiet.

07:19.596 --> 07:21.597
Nobody need know.

07:24.158 --> 07:26.469
I don't know.

07:26.519 --> 07:28.520
You could be of great help to us.

07:38.706 --> 07:41.817
You rub it into your eyelashes
and it makes them lovely.

07:41.867 --> 07:44.979
Sorry I couldn't see you last night.
I was busy with this.

07:45.029 --> 07:49.860
It's a piece about your chief.
I hope he likes it. Oh, I'm sure
he will - cos you wrote it.

07:49.911 --> 07:52.952
The lady flatters me.
What does she want? Dinner. Done.

07:54.793 --> 07:56.794
Good luck.
Mmm.

07:56.914 --> 07:59.315
You and Mr Edward seem close,
Miss Hawkins.

08:00.556 --> 08:02.557
We enjoy spending time together.

08:04.078 --> 08:06.799
He is older than you
and has a certain reputation.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.761
I can look after myself, thank you.

08:12.122 --> 08:15.043
And unlike you,
I enjoy a gentleman's company.

08:19.325 --> 08:22.957
If there's a promotion on British
linen we should make the most of it.

08:23.007 --> 08:25.158
But why do we need
quite so many sheets?

08:25.208 --> 08:28.440
So we don't run out, of course,
even if everybody else does.

08:28.490 --> 08:31.801
What about the soap? You'd be
surprised how quickly it goes.

08:31.851 --> 08:35.763
All 25 boxes of it? Morning,
Mrs Crabb, how are you today?

08:35.813 --> 08:38.014
I need hairpins, Miss Mardle.
12 dozen.

08:38.855 --> 08:40.215
12...

08:46.258 --> 08:48.249
This is made out of British cloth.

08:48.300 --> 08:51.211
We had it in our warehouse,
so I suggested Mr Thackeray

08:51.261 --> 08:54.212
would use it for these patterns.
Mmm. Excellent.

08:54.262 --> 08:57.534
Very good, Mr Leclair.
Very good, both of you.

08:57.584 --> 08:59.585
Fashion has found its feet again.

09:01.346 --> 09:04.337
Mr Selfridge.
Ah, Mr Edwards. Here you are.

09:04.387 --> 09:06.988
Good morning.
Morning. Excuse me, gentlemen?

09:15.513 --> 09:17.263
Well, what is it?

09:17.313 --> 09:20.515
Don't you think you should
stop promoting German labels?

09:21.635 --> 09:25.388
What are you talking about? The hat
you wore into work this morning,

09:25.437 --> 09:28.509
it's a Homburg.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.350
The Homburg has been renamed,
Mr Thackeray.

09:31.401 --> 09:34.912
It's called the Biarritz now.
And those shoes,

09:34.963 --> 09:40.315
handmade in Munich. And I'll
continue to wear them because
they're extremely comfortable.

09:40.364 --> 09:43.717
Now, if you've finished, you need
to re-dress this mannequin.

09:43.767 --> 09:45.757
You've got the look entirely wrong.

09:45.808 --> 09:48.609
The skirt should be higher on
the waist, like this.

09:53.011 --> 09:58.724
"Mr Selfridge stated the Americans
shouldn't be trading with both sides,
making profit from war."

09:58.774 --> 10:02.326
I pinned your colours to the mast.
Thank you. This is good.

10:02.376 --> 10:06.848
You might lose a few friends.
Most of them have gone back to
the States anyway. Hm.

10:06.898 --> 10:11.610
I wanna write a piece about
the Procurement Committee.
They're a pretty powerful bunch.

10:11.661 --> 10:16.052
Don't talk to me about them.
I'm done with the lot of 'em.
Knocked you back, did they?

10:16.103 --> 10:19.024
I gave Loxley some contacts -
but I don't like him.

10:19.904 --> 10:23.016
Anyway, I'm not interested in
the Procurement Committee.

10:23.066 --> 10:25.467
There are other ways
to help the war effort.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.790
Delphine, come and look
what's just arrived.

10:35.752 --> 10:39.344
Don't take it.
Harry Selfridge is buying you.

10:39.394 --> 10:42.585
Let him. I've had enough
independence for one lifetime.

10:42.635 --> 10:44.957
Anyway, I'm not 20 anymore.

10:45.717 --> 10:48.308
You're as good as.
Oh, you're sweet, Jim,

10:48.359 --> 10:52.430
but I have to be realistic.
Now Mr Selfridge is quite a catch.

10:52.480 --> 10:55.592
He's the kind of man, the less you
ask for, the more he gives.

10:55.642 --> 10:58.313
He's married to your chum.
He makes her unhappy.

10:58.363 --> 11:01.194
She doesn't understand him.
And you do?

11:01.244 --> 11:04.486
Oh, yes. I know what makes
Harry Selfridge tick.

11:11.290 --> 11:13.320
Am I disturbing you?
No. Come on in.

11:13.371 --> 11:17.693
I'm just getting a waistcoat made
of this British cloth that
we're promoting.

11:18.654 --> 11:20.965
I just wanted to
say thank you for the wine,

11:21.015 --> 11:23.726
and to tell you
that I can't accept it.

11:23.775 --> 11:26.366
Of course you can.
You'd be doing me a favour.

11:26.417 --> 11:30.729
I need the space in my warehouse and
you organised a great evening
of cards.

11:30.779 --> 11:33.300
Even though you got
no joy from Lord Edgerton.

11:34.260 --> 11:37.572
Can you turn that around fast?
Thank you. Yes, sir.

11:37.623 --> 11:40.253
But Bill Summertime came to see me.

11:40.303 --> 11:42.055
Bill?

11:42.105 --> 11:44.536
But he hardly spoke to you
all evening.

11:44.586 --> 11:46.586
I don't know if
you know what he does.

11:47.387 --> 11:49.388
He enlightened me.

11:50.469 --> 11:52.620
Is he for real?
Well, yes.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.141
He's a very old friend,
we go way back.

11:55.191 --> 11:58.673
But he's impossible to say no to.
What did he come to see you about?

12:00.633 --> 12:02.635
Thank you, Miss Plunkett.

12:06.197 --> 12:08.198
I can't really discuss it.

12:11.079 --> 12:16.392
Huh. Don't be rash. I know you worry
you're not doing your bit for this
country - but it's not true.

12:16.442 --> 12:19.473
People come to this store
and their hearts lighten.

12:19.523 --> 12:22.754
They forget about their problems.
Believe me, I know.

12:22.804 --> 12:25.996
Is the club in trouble?
No.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.997
Only with supplies.

12:28.047 --> 12:31.288
These are tough times.
If there's anything else I can do...

12:32.369 --> 12:34.370
You're sweet.

12:35.730 --> 12:38.082
But I can look after myself.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.133
You should do the same.

12:51.699 --> 12:55.410
Rose. Delphine.
I haven't seen you in so long.

12:55.461 --> 12:59.133
You never come and see me at the
club anymore. I have been so busy

12:59.182 --> 13:01.454
with the store.
Oh, more charity events?

13:01.504 --> 13:03.494
Actually, I'm helping Harry,

13:03.544 --> 13:05.855
particularly with
the new female staff.

13:05.905 --> 13:07.936
Well, that's marvellous.
Hmm.

13:07.986 --> 13:10.258
He enjoyed his card evening
with you.

13:10.308 --> 13:14.740
I should've asked you before leading
him astray. Oh, I'm not his keeper.

13:14.790 --> 13:17.342
So am I forgiven, then?
Nothing to forgive.

13:17.392 --> 13:19.392
Oh, good.

13:20.113 --> 13:22.114
Well, I must rush. Bye, darling.

13:31.318 --> 13:32.319
Come.

13:33.959 --> 13:35.961
Ah, Mr Thackeray.

13:39.882 --> 13:42.804
What can I do for you?
It's a delicate matter.

13:52.288 --> 13:55.840
It's about Monsieur Leclair.
What about him?

13:55.890 --> 13:58.521
I think we need to consider
the possibility

13:58.571 --> 14:00.563
that he's not what he seems.

14:00.613 --> 14:02.613
Huh! What on earth do you mean?

14:03.334 --> 14:05.405
He's behaving strangely.

14:05.455 --> 14:08.967
I saw him, here in this store,
exchange money with a man.

14:09.017 --> 14:12.208
And I know for a fact he's
trying to locate a German person.

14:12.258 --> 14:16.090
A German person? I also think
he's been to Germany recently.

14:16.140 --> 14:19.491
Well, that can't be right. Am I
the only person in the whole store

14:19.541 --> 14:24.934
who can see him for what he is?
He returned, out of the blue,
just before the war started.

14:24.985 --> 14:30.738
He looked unkempt, he refused to
engage in questions about what he'd
been doing for the past four years -

14:30.788 --> 14:33.028
He was in America.
So why did he come back?

14:34.749 --> 14:39.262
These questions have to be asked.
The papers tell us there are
spies everywhere,

14:39.311 --> 14:42.983
and we must be vigilant.
All right, thank you, Mr Thackeray.

14:43.033 --> 14:45.034
I'll look into it.

14:53.878 --> 14:57.560
In the meantime, please keep
your concerns to yourself.

14:58.801 --> 15:00.922
We don't want to
start rumours flying.

15:16.730 --> 15:18.731
Where are you going to?

15:19.571 --> 15:23.013
A variety show. With Mr Colleano.

15:26.455 --> 15:28.646
And what's wrong with that?

15:28.696 --> 15:30.696
You could do better.

15:33.778 --> 15:36.250
You know,
Victor's a good, honest man.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.300
Yeah, unlike me, you mean?

15:39.661 --> 15:46.344
People are saying things about you,
Henri. Oh. What are they saying?

15:47.585 --> 15:49.626
Well, that you're hiding something.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.977
This country's gone mad.

15:53.028 --> 15:55.749
Well, you are hiding something,
aren't you?

15:57.670 --> 15:59.670
Why won't you talk to me?

16:00.552 --> 16:03.433
You, of all people, to doubt me.

I'm to blame as well, though.

I married him for money
and for his power.

I thought I could keep him at bay,
you see?

20:10.934 --> 20:12.935

Indeed they are.

25:01.717 --> 25:05.118
Well, I need the requisite details
in order to extinguish it.

25:06.118 --> 25:10.191

what you've been doing

25:10.241 --> 25:12.562

four years ago?

25:14.203 --> 25:16.514

25:16.564 --> 25:18.875
Yes, but for the whole time?

25:18.925 --> 25:20.926
No, not exactly.

25:22.647 --> 25:24.798
Where were you then?

25:24.847 --> 25:26.849

25:28.169 --> 25:30.171

25:31.652 --> 25:33.733
Yes, Germany.

Henri, I have no intention of
enquiring into your private life.

25:41.176 --> 25:44.887
Good. Because I have no intention
of telling you about it.

25:44.938 --> 25:46.929
But what I would say is

25:46.979 --> 25:50.130
that Mr Selfridge has placed
a great deal of trust in you,

25:50.180 --> 25:53.172
and if you are holding anything back,
anything at all,

25:53.222 --> 25:55.583
now would be the time to tell me.

26:02.067 --> 26:04.067
There's something I must tell you.

26:06.588 --> 26:08.779
I'm going to hand in my notice.

26:08.830 --> 26:12.341
The French government is accepting
all the men for the army.

26:12.391 --> 26:14.392
I wish to leave as soon as I can.

26:21.196 --> 26:24.147
I heard this morning.
The bank's gonna give me a loan

26:24.197 --> 26:27.719
so I can get the restaurant going
again. Oh, that's wonderful.

26:29.759 --> 26:31.761
I'm going to hand in my notice.

26:34.963 --> 26:36.963
Mr Selfridge will miss you.

26:38.924 --> 26:41.685
Will you?
Of course I will. You know I will.

26:48.449 --> 26:50.960
You could come and run
the restaurant with me.

26:51.010 --> 26:53.011
What?

26:54.972 --> 26:56.973
Marry me.

26:58.094 --> 27:03.607
But - Just hear me out, all right?
You need somebody. You think you're
fine on your own - but you're not.

27:03.657 --> 27:06.888
Every since George left
you've been sad, and I see that

27:06.938 --> 27:12.651
and it breaks my heart. I wanna wake
up besides you every morning and fall
asleep besides you every night,

27:12.701 --> 27:17.453
and I think you want that, too.
Victor - We could really make
something of this restaurant.

27:17.503 --> 27:20.214
When we have children,
they can help us as well.

27:20.265 --> 27:22.976
We'll be a proper family.
Life is about people

27:23.026 --> 27:26.377
when it comes down to it,
and nothing else. Victor - Please,

27:26.428 --> 27:31.780
don't say no before you've had a
chance to think it through at least.
If you let me get a word in,

27:31.831 --> 27:33.631
you'd hear what I've got to say.

27:36.472 --> 27:38.473
It's yes.

27:42.515 --> 27:44.517
- Really?
- Really.

27:53.801 --> 27:55.802
Thank you.

27:57.243 --> 28:00.594
So Mr Grove has agreed to
let you play at the charity concert.

28:00.644 --> 28:04.076
Now there will be suffrage ladies
there. Suffrage ladies?

28:04.126 --> 28:06.127
Er... The bossy ladies.
Oh.

28:07.127 --> 28:11.480
But one of the things they do is
organise theatre events at
the military camps.

28:11.530 --> 28:13.651
They might be
able to get you some work.

28:14.411 --> 28:16.362
You are always thinking about me.

28:16.412 --> 28:20.254
Well, it's quite nice to have
someone to think about.

28:25.177 --> 28:27.898
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.
We hadn't started eating.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.410
Has something happened?

28:31.460 --> 28:34.411
Erm... Well... erm...

28:34.461 --> 28:37.532
I shouldn't tell you,
I promised I wouldn't

28:37.582 --> 28:40.454
and you mustn't breathe a word -
Mr Colleano?

28:40.504 --> 28:42.375
He proposed.

28:42.425 --> 28:44.426
Ohh!
And he gave me this.

28:45.386 --> 28:47.977
Oh, Agnes, congratulations.
Thank you.

28:52.870 --> 28:54.821
So, to what do I owe the pleasure?

28:54.871 --> 28:57.232
Felt.
Felt?

28:58.232 --> 29:00.344
Yes, to line military coats.

29:00.394 --> 29:02.745
I need a great deal of it -
and quickly.

29:02.795 --> 29:04.795
I trust you have suppliers.
I do.

29:05.636 --> 29:08.748
Would this information be for
the Procurement Committee?

29:08.798 --> 29:11.229
Does it matter who it's for?
A great deal.

29:11.279 --> 29:17.552
There are businessmen in London who
are trying to buy up material to sell
to the enemy. American businessmen.

29:17.602 --> 29:22.404
Just because they're my countrymen
doesn't mean I have any intention
of helping them.

29:24.445 --> 29:26.446
How do you know about them anyway?

29:29.768 --> 29:32.890
What's so amusing?
Your hypocrisy.

29:33.730 --> 29:37.682
Until a couple of weeks ago, this
shop was full of German merchandise.

29:37.732 --> 29:42.044
As was every store in London.
Britain depended too much
on German manufacturing.

29:42.094 --> 29:44.295
But you still kept on buying
from the...

29:45.696 --> 29:47.697
..good old Fatherland.

29:49.337 --> 29:51.649
I don't trust you, Loxley,

29:51.698 --> 29:53.970
it's as simple as that.

29:54.020 --> 29:56.941
I can't and won't help you.
Find your felt elsewhere.

30:07.387 --> 30:09.978
Who are you to talk about trust,
Selfridge?

30:10.028 --> 30:13.589
You're a tradesman,
and trade is a dirty business.

30:14.550 --> 30:19.622
All you've done is build your vulgar
shop here and get rich.

30:19.672 --> 30:22.474
You've done absolutely nothing
for this country.

30:36.201 --> 30:38.432
There's a guest to see you,
Mr Selfridge.

30:38.481 --> 30:40.482
He's waiting in the courtyard.

30:41.843 --> 30:43.845
Thank you.

30:50.567 --> 30:52.998
Mr Summertime. Good evening.

30:53.048 --> 30:55.050
Mr Selfridge.

30:56.370 --> 30:58.372
We need to know your answer.

31:00.973 --> 31:03.483
Well, I made a fuss about
the government

31:03.534 --> 31:05.525
not using me for the war effort.

31:05.575 --> 31:07.896
I'd be a coward and a hypocrite
if I said no.

31:09.377 --> 31:12.848
Good man. Now, here's the names of
the manufacturers

31:12.899 --> 31:14.900
we wanted to try to meet.

31:16.820 --> 31:20.292
The name at the top is of
particular interest to us.

31:20.342 --> 31:23.533
He's due in Berlin
in the next couple of weeks, so...

31:23.583 --> 31:25.905
we maybe ask you to go
at a moment's notice.

31:32.748 --> 31:35.820
I was thinking about
going to Europe. Why?

31:35.870 --> 31:40.462
I have to tie up
some supply situations.

31:40.512 --> 31:43.223
But don't worry,
I'll be on American papers.

31:43.273 --> 31:45.985
I'll be fine.

31:46.035 --> 31:48.666
Where in Europe?
Paris mostly.

31:48.716 --> 31:50.717
Mmm.

32:07.506 --> 32:13.658
I'm excited about tonight. I need to
talk to you about something. If it's
about work, it can wait. It can't.

32:13.708 --> 32:15.939
You look beautiful.
Thanks.

32:15.989 --> 32:18.430
Oh, I'm looking forward to this.
Shall we go?

32:31.597 --> 32:33.598
Here, allow me.

32:35.960 --> 32:38.551
It's kind of you
to borrow these for me.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.642
You need to look your best,
don't you?

32:43.322 --> 32:45.484
Am I good?
Very good.

32:50.526 --> 32:55.319
Er... I thought you
might like to wear these.

32:55.368 --> 32:57.560
They belong to George.

32:57.609 --> 33:00.332
Are you sure?
He'd want for you to wear them.

33:09.096 --> 33:11.096
Good evening.
Good evening.

33:12.217 --> 33:14.338
Good evening, Mr Grove.
Good evening.

33:15.539 --> 33:17.539
Ah, Miss Towler.

33:18.260 --> 33:19.891
Good evening, Miss Mardle.

33:19.941 --> 33:24.213
Where is your violinist? Mr Chapman
would very much like to meet her.

33:24.263 --> 33:26.945
Oh, this is Florian, Mr Grove.
Ah.

33:28.906 --> 33:30.896
But... I thought...?

33:30.946 --> 33:35.299
Yes, there was a bit of mix-up, but
we're happy to have Florian staying
with us.

33:35.348 --> 33:37.699
Where is Mr Chapman?

33:37.749 --> 33:40.391
He's on the terrace,
waiting to begin.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.593
Just through there, Florian.
Thank you.

33:45.633 --> 33:47.635
Good luck.

33:49.876 --> 33:51.866
I can't quite believe you have

33:51.916 --> 33:54.668
a young man living with you
in your house.

33:54.718 --> 33:57.629
Well, I couldn't turn him away,
could I?

33:57.679 --> 34:01.481
Special times call for special
measures. Don't you think, Mr Grove?

34:02.402 --> 34:05.273
Now, if you'll excuse me?
Where am I sitting?

34:05.323 --> 34:07.364
Right this way, ma'am.
Oh, thank you.

34:10.646 --> 34:14.678
Good evening, Mr Selfridge.
Mrs Selfridge.
You look very smart, Mr Crabb.

34:14.728 --> 34:18.958
Oh. Could I have a quick
word, Chief? I'll see you in there.

34:19.009 --> 34:23.012
There's a gentleman to see you in
your office. He says it's urgent.

34:28.054 --> 34:30.565
Do you know what? Piccadilly.

34:30.616 --> 34:33.737
Good evening, Miss Towler.
Good evening, Mr Thackeray.

34:51.105 --> 34:53.176
Good evening, Mrs Selfridge.

34:53.226 --> 34:55.217
Lord Loxley. Lady Mae.

34:55.268 --> 34:57.339
I'm looking forward to this.

34:57.388 --> 35:00.900

the only Americans left in town.

35:00.950 --> 35:04.982

but Selfridges is a British store

35:05.032 --> 35:07.863
and its very proud to play its part.
Where is Harry?

35:07.914 --> 35:10.915
He should be here any moment.
Please, take your seats.

35:12.036 --> 35:14.036
Mr Crabb, can I have a word?

35:15.157 --> 35:17.269
Um...
We really can't wait any longer.

35:17.318 --> 35:19.959
We'll have to begin without him.
Yes. Thank you.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.952
Gentlemen, we're about to start.
Thank you.

35:24.001 --> 35:26.433
We have to leave now, Mr Selfridge.

35:26.482 --> 35:28.674
T-Tonight?
Yes, right away. We've heard

35:28.724 --> 35:33.316
the chap we want you to meet is in
Berlin. He may not stay long.
I have a concert to attend.

you'll be back in a few days.

and your staff.
