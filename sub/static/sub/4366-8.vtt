00:01.145 --> 00:02.790
You are being watched.

00:03.752 --> 00:05.634
The government has
a secret system,

00:06.199 --> 00:07.928
a machine that spies on you

00:08.007 --> 00:09.671
every hour of every day.

00:10.678 --> 00:11.594
I know because

00:11.789 --> 00:12.654
I built it.

00:13.206 --> 00:15.381
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:15.487 --> 00:16.902
but it sees everything...

00:16.904 --> 00:19.687
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people,

00:19.689 --> 00:21.123
people like you,

00:21.125 --> 00:24.793
crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:24.795 --> 00:28.146
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

00:28.148 --> 00:30.048
But I needed a partner--

00:30.050 --> 00:32.718
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

00:32.720 --> 00:37.372
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:37.374 --> 00:39.307
You'll never find us.

00:39.309 --> 00:41.343
But victim or perpetrator,

00:41.345 --> 00:44.262
if you're number's up,
we'll find you.

00:57.544 --> 01:00.529

for the eastbound express--

01:34.565 --> 01:35.781
Track 18.

01:35.783 --> 01:38.867
Final boarding call,
eastbound express-- Track 18.

01:38.869 --> 01:40.435
All aboard.

01:40.437 --> 01:44.272
No, thanks.
I don't drink coffee.

01:44.274 --> 01:46.875
Sencha green tea...

01:46.877 --> 01:49.744
One sugar.

01:49.746 --> 01:51.613
You've been paying attention.

01:51.615 --> 01:53.999
Relax, Finch.
It's just tea.

01:54.001 --> 01:57.252
I haven't guessed
your favorite color yet.

01:57.254 --> 02:00.555
New number...

02:00.557 --> 02:02.140
Wallace Negel.

02:02.142 --> 02:03.958
Born in Germany, 1946,

02:03.960 --> 02:06.678
immigrated to the US in 1980,

02:06.680 --> 02:09.181
worked
in international export--

02:09.183 --> 02:11.132
Good credit, perfect taxes.

02:11.134 --> 02:12.901
Wait a minute.
Are these dates right?

02:12.903 --> 02:14.152
You noticed.

02:14.154 --> 02:17.239
Negel hasn't made
a single electronic transaction

02:17.241 --> 02:20.108
in his own name
since December of 1987.

02:20.110 --> 02:22.160
So where has
he been for 24 years?

02:22.162 --> 02:23.528
And why is he back?

02:23.530 --> 02:25.780
I don't think there is a Negel.

02:25.782 --> 02:28.200
Foreign background,
boring life,

02:28.202 --> 02:32.170
a job involving travel--
Spycraft 101.

02:32.172 --> 02:34.039
This is an alias.

02:34.041 --> 02:35.790
I've used dozens of them.

02:35.792 --> 02:37.342
I think Negel is a cover.

02:37.344 --> 02:39.377
So, where do we start?

02:39.379 --> 02:42.830
Shortly before
he disappeared in 1987,

02:42.832 --> 02:45.634
Negel purchased a cemetery plot
in the Bronx.

02:45.636 --> 02:49.020
I've checked.
It's still there.

02:49.022 --> 02:50.138
[Keys clacking]

02:50.140 --> 02:52.023
Why does
a person who doesn't exist

02:52.025 --> 02:53.475
need a cemetery plot?

02:53.477 --> 02:54.976
Right?

02:54.978 --> 02:58.029
- Might be worth a look.
- Hmm.

02:58.031 --> 03:00.282
Where are you going?

03:00.284 --> 03:03.201
If we're dealing
with a spy from the 1980s,

03:03.203 --> 03:06.538
I know someone
who can provide us

03:06.540 --> 03:09.624
with the kind of pre-digital
information we need--

03:09.626 --> 03:14.028
Things I can't find
on computers.

03:21.187 --> 03:22.354
All first editions,

03:22.356 --> 03:24.472
the best available
on German history.

03:24.474 --> 03:26.525
The entire span
of the cold war would do it,

03:26.527 --> 03:28.694
but specifically, the 1980s.

03:28.696 --> 03:33.615
And I'll be needing something
more precise than books.

03:33.617 --> 03:36.919
[Chuckles]
I'm not sure what you mean.

03:36.921 --> 03:39.755
How about the Soviet submarine
schematics that you sold

03:39.757 --> 03:41.707
back to Russian intelligence
last year?

03:41.709 --> 03:45.043
You register that income
with the IRS, FBI?

03:45.045 --> 03:49.882
It'd be hard to run this store
from prison, don't you think?

03:56.005 --> 03:59.308
Row 18,

03:59.310 --> 04:02.060
plot 20.

04:03.897 --> 04:05.397
Hmm.

04:19.695 --> 04:21.579
What was the name?

04:21.582 --> 04:24.082
- Wallace Negel.
- Yeah.

04:24.084 --> 04:26.534
Before the country reunified,

04:26.536 --> 04:28.470
east Germany was the greatest
surveillance state

04:28.472 --> 04:29.922
the world has seen.

04:29.924 --> 04:32.391
The Stasi knew everything.

04:32.393 --> 04:35.260
I've read about them.
I'm a sucker for surveillance.

04:35.262 --> 04:38.180
They had millions
of hours of wiretaps,

04:38.182 --> 04:40.649
sweat and body-odor samples.

04:40.651 --> 04:43.852
I just need a name
to go with an alias.

04:43.854 --> 04:46.355
Real name Ulrich Kohl--

04:46.357 --> 04:48.023
Part of an espionage team.

04:48.025 --> 04:50.242
I've read
about the Stasi teams--

04:50.244 --> 04:52.160
Kohl's unit
went around the world,

04:52.162 --> 04:54.246
in and out of Western Europe
and the US.

04:54.248 --> 04:56.081
That's why he needed
the American papers.

04:56.083 --> 04:58.083
The team hunted down
east German defectors

04:58.085 --> 05:00.168
and neutralized them
before they could talk.

05:00.170 --> 05:01.503
"Neutralized."

05:01.505 --> 05:04.289
Where guys like him went,

05:04.291 --> 05:07.843
people died.

05:07.845 --> 05:09.378
Um...

05:09.380 --> 05:13.298
How did you know
about the submarine schematics?

05:13.300 --> 05:15.183
Told you...

05:15.185 --> 05:17.603
I'm a sucker for surveillance.

05:17.605 --> 05:20.772
Looks like Kohl was in Europe
when the wall fell.

05:20.774 --> 05:22.608
Western authorities
were hunting him,

05:22.610 --> 05:25.394
so he ran to hide
in the Soviet Union.

05:25.396 --> 05:27.362
His wife, Anja,

05:27.364 --> 05:30.098
who worked as a secretary
at Stasi headquarters,

05:30.100 --> 05:32.117
ran with him,

05:32.119 --> 05:35.404
but she was killed
in a car accident shortly after.

05:35.706 --> 05:37.539
That was in 1987.

05:37.541 --> 05:42.127
By '89, east Germany
has collapsed.

05:42.229 --> 05:46.749
The Stasi no longer exists,
and Kohl...

05:46.750 --> 05:48.683
Was never heard from again.

05:48.685 --> 05:50.352
Well, he's here now.

05:50.354 --> 05:51.937
Negel's cemetery plot--

05:51.939 --> 05:55.423
It was a buried stash kit.
He dug it up a few hours ago.

05:55.425 --> 05:56.758
What do you think was in it?

05:56.760 --> 05:59.444
If it was anything
like the ones I used to bury,

05:59.446 --> 06:03.148
IDs, weapons, definitely money.

06:03.150 --> 06:06.568
So it seems Kohl,
the spy, is back.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.420
[Knock on door]

06:25.422 --> 06:26.805
Hauffe.

06:26.807 --> 06:30.592
Sorry?

06:30.594 --> 06:32.177
Can I help you?

06:38.567 --> 06:42.404
It can't be you.

06:46.909 --> 06:48.660
[Groans]

06:48.662 --> 06:50.812
We have something to discuss.

06:58.382 --> 06:59.615
You're the new guy, right?

06:59.617 --> 07:02.701
Let's go somewhere private
so we can talk.

07:04.437 --> 07:06.288
You're Stanton?
I'm--

07:06.290 --> 07:07.772
No, you're not.

07:07.774 --> 07:09.825
The ID NCS gave you
didn't pass muster,

07:09.827 --> 07:11.577
so you're nobody,

07:11.579 --> 07:15.447
which means I get to name you.

07:15.449 --> 07:18.717
Wilson, maybe.

07:18.719 --> 07:21.803
No.
You should have a drink.

07:21.805 --> 07:23.622
I don't drink when I'm working.

07:23.624 --> 07:25.674
No?
Well, start.

07:25.676 --> 07:28.343
You tier one boys
are all the same--

07:28.345 --> 07:29.461
Tense.

07:29.463 --> 07:32.797
Out here,
"tense" gets us killed.

07:32.799 --> 07:34.650
In your old job,
you were behind enemy lines

07:34.652 --> 07:37.686
for 6, 12 months?

07:37.688 --> 07:40.689
In this job, you never go back,

07:40.691 --> 07:43.358
because there is no line
to cross back over.

07:43.360 --> 07:48.313
Never was.
Understand?

07:48.315 --> 07:51.650
So you may as well
get comfortable.

07:55.154 --> 07:58.290
When you were in transit,

07:58.292 --> 08:00.258
did you see any old friends?

08:00.260 --> 08:01.927
No.

08:01.929 --> 08:04.346
Why are you asking?

08:20.229 --> 08:22.197
We know
about the ex-girlfriend.

08:22.199 --> 08:23.815
Like I told you,

08:23.817 --> 08:26.017
you never go back.

08:26.019 --> 08:28.654
[Door opens,
indistinct chatter]

08:33.159 --> 08:36.378
The coin Kohl dropped...

08:36.380 --> 08:39.131
Was an east German mark.

08:39.133 --> 08:43.501
They've been out of circulation
everywhere since 1990,

08:43.504 --> 08:45.754
but I found a rare-coin
exchange in the city

08:45.756 --> 08:48.757
where a whole set of marks
was sold this morning.

08:48.759 --> 08:53.011
Let me guess,
the seller was Ulrich Kohl.

08:53.013 --> 08:54.763
Correct.

08:54.765 --> 08:58.817
He used the store's phone,
waited for an answer, hung up.

08:58.819 --> 09:02.070
I traced the call to that
address in the west village--

09:02.072 --> 09:04.906
Apartment 4A.

09:08.828 --> 09:12.063
Finch, we're too late.

09:20.289 --> 09:23.458
Kohl called to make sure
he was home.

09:27.764 --> 09:29.347
He was interrogated.

09:29.349 --> 09:32.584
I'm going through
more of these records.

09:32.586 --> 09:35.053
Kohl was part
of a four man team.

09:35.055 --> 09:36.471
He shared trigger duties

09:36.473 --> 09:38.473
with a team leader
named Steiller.

09:38.475 --> 09:42.477
They were backed by a document
forger named Wernick...

09:42.479 --> 09:43.895
[Beeping] Ah.

09:43.897 --> 09:45.764
And they reported
to a case officer

09:45.766 --> 09:47.566
named Hauffe for orders.

09:47.568 --> 09:49.034
So who's this dead guy?

09:49.036 --> 09:53.121
The apartment
is leased to Andrew Honem--

09:53.123 --> 09:56.825
An unmarried,
retired architect.

10:06.085 --> 10:08.787
Kohl's job
was killing defectors.

10:13.793 --> 10:17.229
Sounds like this guy
might have been one.

10:17.231 --> 10:19.731
Hang on, Finch.

10:25.822 --> 10:29.024
[Wood squeaks]

10:39.452 --> 10:41.453
Half the intelligence services
in the world

10:41.455 --> 10:43.338
were tracking
these guys at one point.

10:43.340 --> 10:46.708
But they were ghosts--
Untraceable.

10:50.213 --> 10:52.631
Finch, what was the case
officer's name again?

10:52.633 --> 10:55.050
Hauffe.

10:56.602 --> 10:58.303
This dead guy was Hauffe.

10:58.305 --> 11:01.139
Kohl killed his Stasi teammate.

11:01.141 --> 11:02.524
And he will kill again.

11:02.526 --> 11:06.778
I don't know who you are
or how you know to be here,

11:06.780 --> 11:08.947
but this is just the beginning.

11:08.949 --> 11:11.817
Then this is gonna be
a long day.

11:28.384 --> 11:29.868
Finch, I got company.

11:29.870 --> 11:34.306
BND--
German intelligence.

11:34.308 --> 11:36.224
He seemed to know
what went down here.

11:36.226 --> 11:40.061
He also seemed sure
Kohl would kill again.

11:40.063 --> 11:44.883
[Cell phone rings]

11:44.885 --> 11:46.184
Detective Fusco.

11:46.186 --> 11:49.771
Anonymous tip for you, Lionel.

11:49.773 --> 11:52.240
You got to stop
calling me here.

11:52.242 --> 11:53.992
Homicide in the west village.

11:53.994 --> 11:56.278
I think the shooter might have
others planned today.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.948
I left you a care package
at the scene.

11:59.950 --> 12:02.367
I need you to find out
whatever he knows.

12:02.369 --> 12:03.702
Yeah, well, I can't do anything

12:03.704 --> 12:04.836
till someone calls in a crime.

12:04.838 --> 12:07.255
You'll get a call--
"Shots fired."

12:07.257 --> 12:09.457
Were there shots fired?

12:09.459 --> 12:12.344
[Gunshots]

12:12.346 --> 12:13.879
There were now.

12:20.887 --> 12:22.587
Hauffe's dead.

12:22.589 --> 12:24.522
Who's next on Kohl's hit list?

12:24.524 --> 12:26.892
I took an encrypted phone
from that German agent.

12:26.894 --> 12:30.312
Every text is blocked except
for the one they were reading--

12:30.314 --> 12:33.398
Julian Werner.

12:33.400 --> 12:36.100
Werner is a Wall Street lawyer,

12:36.102 --> 12:38.370
and...

12:38.372 --> 12:40.322
Werner is really Wernick--

12:40.324 --> 12:42.240
The forger.

12:42.242 --> 12:45.126
Kohl's entire team is living
under aliases in New York.

12:45.128 --> 12:48.246
The perfect place
to disappear, right, Finch?

12:48.248 --> 12:50.632
These people
were his teammates.

12:50.634 --> 12:52.884
Why would he be hunting them
two decades later?

12:52.886 --> 12:55.003
Kohl vanishes without a trace,

12:55.005 --> 12:58.173
and his teammates end up
living cushy lives in New York.

12:58.175 --> 12:59.958
This could be revenge
for something--

12:59.960 --> 13:01.593
Maybe more than we know.

13:01.595 --> 13:03.628
- The wife's death?
- The car crash.

13:03.630 --> 13:06.681
She died in '87,
the same year he disappeared.

13:06.683 --> 13:09.434
And I know a staged accident
when I see it.

13:09.436 --> 13:12.187
We need to get to Wernick
before Kohl does.

13:38.297 --> 13:40.715
I thought you were dead.

13:42.134 --> 13:45.720
Still with the needle, I see.

13:47.890 --> 13:49.441
What is it coated with?

13:49.443 --> 13:52.560
Something fast.

13:52.562 --> 13:55.230
It's the least I could do
for an old colleague.

13:55.232 --> 13:57.532
How long have I got?

13:57.534 --> 14:00.285
Long enough.

14:00.287 --> 14:02.070
Where is your accent,
<i>Hauptmann?</i>

14:02.072 --> 14:04.823
We were advised...

14:04.825 --> 14:06.992
To blend in America.

14:06.994 --> 14:09.494
I saw Hauffe this morning.

14:09.496 --> 14:11.913
He was a good case officer.

14:11.915 --> 14:14.799
He kept information on you
all these years.

14:18.337 --> 14:20.622
Do you remember...

14:20.624 --> 14:23.925
My Anja?

14:23.927 --> 14:25.260
I called Werner's assistant.

14:25.262 --> 14:27.929
He has lunch
at the same place every day.

14:27.931 --> 14:29.681
I'm on my way.

14:29.683 --> 14:31.649
I remember.

14:31.651 --> 14:35.603
I didn't know they would go
after her, too.

14:35.605 --> 14:38.690
But killing me won't bring
her back, Ulrich.

14:41.277 --> 14:45.697
I told her
I would keep her safe.

14:45.699 --> 14:48.533
What happened to you, Ulrich?

14:49.702 --> 14:51.903
I paid...

14:51.905 --> 14:53.421
For my sins,

14:53.423 --> 14:57.275
for yours, for the team.

14:57.277 --> 15:01.212
The people who caught me
kept me in a hole,

15:01.214 --> 15:05.467
but I never stopped thinking,
planning.

15:05.469 --> 15:10.088
It was long ago.
I let myself forget.

15:10.090 --> 15:13.141
I did not have that luxury.

15:13.143 --> 15:16.694
It was wrong what we did.

15:18.864 --> 15:22.734
You'll go after Steiller next?

15:22.736 --> 15:25.370
Then...

15:27.073 --> 15:30.158
Be at peace, my old friend.

15:38.919 --> 15:42.120
[Chatter continues]

15:42.122 --> 15:44.672

at 43 19th street--

15:44.674 --> 15:46.674

15:46.676 --> 15:49.561
Ma'am, stand back, please.

15:49.563 --> 15:50.895
Excuse me.

15:52.731 --> 15:54.966
Weak pulse, but tachycardic--
BP is 70/30.

15:54.968 --> 15:57.085

signs of internal asphyxia.

15:57.087 --> 15:59.187

16:05.495 --> 16:07.412
[Shouts] Hey!

16:07.414 --> 16:09.864
[Sirens wailing]

16:20.143 --> 16:21.226
You can't breathe.

16:21.228 --> 16:23.895
You have foam in your nose
and your mouth.

16:23.897 --> 16:25.814
It's hydrocyanic acid.

16:25.816 --> 16:29.050
Now, they're going to find us
in four minutes.

16:29.052 --> 16:32.220
I can save you,
but you need to talk.

16:35.358 --> 16:39.578
What did Kohl come for?
Why is he after all of you?

16:39.580 --> 16:43.231
[Weakly] Kohl was killing
their informants.

16:43.233 --> 16:46.168
The Americans wanted him gone.

16:46.170 --> 16:47.953
So you gave them Kohl.

16:47.955 --> 16:52.073
They offered us a new life.

16:52.075 --> 16:55.043
We traded Ulrich.

16:55.045 --> 16:57.679
You were his team...

16:57.681 --> 17:00.182
His friends.

17:00.184 --> 17:02.601
A soldier deserves better.

17:02.603 --> 17:05.804
I give you these, and you live.

17:05.806 --> 17:08.723
What happened
after you defected?

17:08.726 --> 17:11.977
They told us
Kohl ran to the Soviets--

17:11.979 --> 17:14.112
He and Anja.

17:14.114 --> 17:17.098
The Americans went for him.

17:17.099 --> 17:19.451
[Indistinct chatter over radio]

17:19.453 --> 17:20.868
They got her, too.

17:20.871 --> 17:22.738
The car accident.

17:22.740 --> 17:24.656
[Groaning] Yes.

17:24.657 --> 17:26.992
Who will Kohl go after next?

17:26.993 --> 17:28.143
St--

17:28.145 --> 17:30.412
Steiller...

17:30.414 --> 17:32.464
He defected
with the rest of you?

17:32.466 --> 17:34.750
Hey?
What's his alias?

17:43.393 --> 17:46.411
I kept the lawyer alive,
but Kohl's not done yet.

17:46.413 --> 17:49.514
Kohl's team betrayed him,
and it got his wife killed.

17:49.516 --> 17:51.600
They preserved themselves
over him.

17:51.602 --> 17:53.735
This is as personal as it gets.

17:53.737 --> 17:54.853
So where's Steiller?

17:54.855 --> 17:56.988
Finch, I saw the exact same pin

17:56.990 --> 17:59.107
in Hauffe's apartment.

18:02.628 --> 18:05.330
The Volks American Society...

18:05.332 --> 18:07.582
Is an organization
for New York citizens

18:07.584 --> 18:09.317
of German heritage.

18:09.319 --> 18:11.319
When the Stasi team defected,

18:11.321 --> 18:13.422
they wouldn't have been allowed
to contact each other.

18:13.424 --> 18:15.173
A German organization
would give all three

18:15.175 --> 18:17.042
a chance to meet in public.

18:17.044 --> 18:19.211
[Keys clacking]

18:19.213 --> 18:22.180
So, if Hauffe and Wernick
were members...

18:22.182 --> 18:24.382
Then Steiller
would have been, too.

18:26.602 --> 18:27.886
There are two crime scenes--

18:27.888 --> 18:29.938
One in the West Village,
the other near Wall Street.

18:29.940 --> 18:32.190
Now, the same senior citizen
wearing a gray suit

18:32.192 --> 18:33.859
was seen fleeing
both locations.

18:33.861 --> 18:35.277
Wall Street?

18:35.279 --> 18:37.279
That's where the ambulance
was jacked earlier, right?

18:37.281 --> 18:38.346
It sure was.

18:38.348 --> 18:39.981
Read the description
of who jacked it?

18:39.983 --> 18:42.901
My guy?
How's he involved in this?

18:42.903 --> 18:46.187
And this guy was found
unconscious at the first scene.

18:46.189 --> 18:48.189
Nice bruises.

18:48.191 --> 18:49.541
He say anything yet,

18:49.543 --> 18:52.193
like who kicked
his ass sideways?

18:52.195 --> 18:53.795
[Chuckles]
Yeah, two words--

18:53.797 --> 18:55.029
"Phone call."

18:55.031 --> 18:57.031
Everything else is in German.

19:01.254 --> 19:03.672
Either of these guys
look familiar to you?

19:03.674 --> 19:04.673
[Door closes]

19:04.675 --> 19:06.324
Now, we know
you're German intel.

19:06.326 --> 19:07.559
We know a lot.

19:07.561 --> 19:09.177
If that's all you know,
<i>polizei,</i>

19:09.179 --> 19:10.645
then you don't know very much.

19:10.647 --> 19:12.681
Yeah, why don't you tell me
about your homicidal geriatric?

19:12.683 --> 19:15.049
[Angrily speaking German]

19:16.769 --> 19:20.021
Two crimes,
a very dangerous man at work,

19:20.023 --> 19:22.557
and one agent trying
to stop a killer?

19:22.559 --> 19:26.661
It'd be a shame if we <i>polizei</i>
couldn't help.

19:27.563 --> 19:29.698
His name is Kohl.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.566
He is a prisoner...

19:31.568 --> 19:34.286
Arrested in an operation between
my government and yours

19:34.288 --> 19:37.289
24 years ago.

19:37.291 --> 19:40.842
He had become old,
feeble, they thought.

19:40.844 --> 19:42.627
The order was given
to transfer him

19:42.629 --> 19:44.596
to a minimum security facility.

19:44.598 --> 19:46.014
And I'm guessing he escaped.

19:46.016 --> 19:48.550
He's smart and lethal.

19:48.552 --> 19:50.468
And he killed Germans
for years.

19:50.470 --> 19:51.803
There is nothing more important

19:51.805 --> 19:53.588
than putting him back
where he belongs.

19:53.590 --> 19:55.640
Why not involve US authorities?

19:55.642 --> 19:58.476
He was jailed without trial.

19:58.478 --> 20:01.396
Kohl isn't supposed to exist.

20:01.398 --> 20:04.533
No one wants
an international incident.

20:04.535 --> 20:07.118
You aren't supposed to be
operating on US soil.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.103
Where he goes,
people will keep dying.

20:09.105 --> 20:10.822
Then help us.
We want the same thing.

20:10.824 --> 20:11.873
Don't say another word.

20:11.875 --> 20:13.274
Hey, whoa,
this is an interrogation.

20:13.276 --> 20:15.660
- You can't be in here.
- This interview is over.

20:15.662 --> 20:18.129
I am from the German consulate,

20:18.131 --> 20:21.967
and this is
from the US State Department--

20:21.969 --> 20:27.005
Orders to extradite him
back to Germany immediately.

20:28.841 --> 20:30.959
The Volks American website
wasn't even using

20:30.961 --> 20:32.844
an open SSH secure proxy.

20:32.846 --> 20:34.729
I cloned their log-in form
in seconds.

20:34.731 --> 20:36.264
Finch, the point?

20:36.266 --> 20:38.316
I found the complete
membership roster.

20:38.318 --> 20:39.818
Hauffe and Wernick
are both on it.

on the other members.

only go back to 1988.

20:48.929 --> 20:50.478
If the pattern follows...

20:50.480 --> 20:52.781
Then Stegans
is really Steiller.

He remembers you.

all his old Stasi colleagues.

I knew this day would come.

21:37.077 --> 21:39.160
You were too good.

21:39.162 --> 21:41.079
I learned from the best.

21:41.081 --> 21:43.715
I learned from you.

You were my friend.

You knew me.

21:49.556 --> 21:52.924
You knew my wife.

as much as I did.

21:55.312 --> 21:57.545
You changed, Ulrich.

the missions did to you--

The darkness in your eyes.

22:03.186 --> 22:05.437
You believed in the killing.

You trained me.
You made me what I was.

22:09.493 --> 22:11.276

I believed in you.

22:12.946 --> 22:14.729
We could not save you.

22:14.731 --> 22:17.248
So you left Anja
and me to the hounds...

22:17.250 --> 22:19.868
For some money and an apartment
in New York City?

22:19.870 --> 22:21.202

to Anja, though...

to his list.

and she betrayed him.

24:09.192 --> 24:10.491
To a man like Kohl,

24:10.493 --> 24:13.161
that makes her
just as much a target.

is getting deported.

looking for the shooter.

It's Anja.

[Tires squealing]

26:44.513 --> 26:46.180
Anja isn't here, Kohl.

She's safe...

26:48.935 --> 26:51.602
Where you can't get to her.

26:51.604 --> 26:54.689
That's a Welrod, isn't it?

26:54.691 --> 26:57.391
Only 73 decibels when fired.

26:57.393 --> 27:00.444
But it won't stop me
before I get to you.

27:00.446 --> 27:04.332
And I lose my patience
when I get shot.

27:07.002 --> 27:08.902

27:08.904 --> 27:12.206
What's your plan, Kohl, hmm?

27:12.208 --> 27:14.241
You gonna kill her, too...

27:14.243 --> 27:15.509
Your own wife?

27:15.511 --> 27:20.214
You don't have a plan, do you?

27:20.216 --> 27:22.633

27:30.108 --> 27:32.977

with quite a headache.

27:34.613 --> 27:35.813
Ulrich?

27:35.815 --> 27:38.032
It can't be.

27:38.034 --> 27:40.401
He's coming for me, isn't he?

27:40.403 --> 27:41.819
Yes.

27:41.821 --> 27:44.038
What's important now is getting
you into police custody.

27:44.040 --> 27:45.939
There's a detective
at the eighth precinct--

27:45.941 --> 27:47.658
No, wait.
We can't go yet.

27:47.660 --> 27:49.160
It's safe there.
I promise.

27:49.162 --> 27:52.046
Not yet, please.
I need to make a phone call.

27:52.048 --> 27:54.749
A camera...

27:57.552 --> 27:59.637
It's extraordinary.

27:59.639 --> 28:02.890
The Stasi would have killed
for this technology.

Skills...

28:16.072 --> 28:17.071
Items.

28:17.073 --> 28:18.189
They all laughed at me

28:18.191 --> 28:21.075
when I learned
to use these needles.

28:21.077 --> 28:23.577
They didn't laugh for long.

28:23.579 --> 28:26.030
I was, uh...

28:26.032 --> 28:29.617
Bagged by an insurgent patrol
when I was in Kandahar.

28:29.619 --> 28:32.586
They used electricity on me...

28:32.588 --> 28:34.872
16 hours.

28:34.874 --> 28:37.041
All they wanted was my name.

I hide a gun in this dress?

Who's this?

29:13.212 --> 29:15.880

Miller said you like bourbon.

You know what they drink here?

29:20.219 --> 29:22.553
Plum brandy.

- A shame about Miller.
- What happened to him?

29:31.481 --> 29:35.316
So...
What can we do for you?

29:36.435 --> 29:39.403
We're looking into reports
that Alim Assir

29:39.405 --> 29:41.272
was in country last week,

29:41.274 --> 29:43.240
possibly to secure financing.

29:43.242 --> 29:44.692
We sent all of our intel

29:44.694 --> 29:46.911
in the pouch
to Langley last week.

29:46.913 --> 29:49.447
And Assir made it
out of the country safely

29:49.449 --> 29:50.915
two days ago.

29:50.917 --> 29:52.450
We want to know how.

29:52.452 --> 29:54.568
That's also in our intel.

29:54.570 --> 29:58.589
Like we said, he must have paid
customs a fortune.

29:58.591 --> 30:02.126
And how much did he pay you?

30:27.620 --> 30:29.954
Thank you.

shot them off the road

something out-- It's urgent.

That hydrogen cyanide
that you used on Wernick--

31:41.343 --> 31:43.761
You didn't bring that
into the country.

31:43.763 --> 31:46.530
You bought that here
and mixed it yourself...

he loved me...

I knew he couldn't talk
about what he did.

had turned on him.

He was a soldier in Germany...

36:57.093 --> 36:59.343
Before she moved here.

36:59.345 --> 37:00.595
He was a brave man.

He died a hero.

After the Berlin wall fell,
he helped her get out.

a life here.

Can you forgive me
for the person I was?

38:45.235 --> 38:47.652

To see both of your faces.

39:29.746 --> 39:31.395
Who has a 20 on that shot?

39:31.397 --> 39:32.830
[Ulrich groaning]

39:32.832 --> 39:34.332
Are you all right?

39:34.334 --> 39:36.951
[Crying] Ulrich, no.

39:36.953 --> 39:38.736
No, no.

39:38.738 --> 39:41.706
Finch, get them out of here.

39:41.708 --> 39:44.675
[Sobbing]

39:44.677 --> 39:48.462
You were right to fear me.

39:48.464 --> 39:51.549
You were right.

40:01.893 --> 40:03.427
Empty.

40:12.904 --> 40:15.156
I wouldn't have hurt her.

40:19.077 --> 40:22.112
I never had a tomorrow.

40:24.616 --> 40:26.967
[Chuckles]

40:26.969 --> 40:29.837
How did you know I'd shoot?

40:29.839 --> 40:33.123
You are a soldier, like me.

40:37.512 --> 40:41.766
They took everything I had.

40:41.768 --> 40:45.469
But part of me survived.

40:47.155 --> 40:48.989
It was...

40:48.991 --> 40:50.858
Her.

40:52.361 --> 40:55.863
[Exhales deeply, groans]

41:01.336 --> 41:04.288
[Over radio] All units, we've
located source of that shot.

41:04.290 --> 41:06.957
Shooter--
Male, down, dead.

41:06.959 --> 41:08.626
Bravo team leader, report in.

41:08.628 --> 41:10.828
[Indistinct chatter
over police radio]

41:10.830 --> 41:12.847
Who'd you think it was, Carter?

41:12.849 --> 41:17.218
[Men speaking indistinctly]

41:27.696 --> 41:30.097
Harper.

41:30.099 --> 41:34.068
No, not a Harper.

41:35.153 --> 41:37.037
I need you to dispose of this

41:37.039 --> 41:38.489
and them.

41:38.491 --> 41:40.040
You didn't even question them.

41:40.042 --> 41:42.326
We don't have time
for questions--

41:42.328 --> 41:44.578
Only answers.

41:44.580 --> 41:47.665
These men took a bribe
to let a mass murderer escape.

41:50.635 --> 41:52.503
How do we know it was them?

41:52.505 --> 41:55.172
Anonymous source--

41:55.174 --> 41:58.509
Very reliable.

41:58.511 --> 42:00.811
You need to know this is right?

42:00.813 --> 42:04.515
I'll tell you one last time
before it gets complicated.

42:04.517 --> 42:06.567
This is right.

42:06.569 --> 42:09.620
The threat is real.

42:09.622 --> 42:12.056
Your country needs you.

42:13.859 --> 42:17.111
No teeth, no fingertips.

42:17.113 --> 42:19.830
One last thing...

42:21.750 --> 42:24.735
You don't have any old friends.

42:24.737 --> 42:26.871
You see them...

42:26.873 --> 42:29.540
You don't know them.

42:29.542 --> 42:32.409
We're walking in the dark here,
you understand?

42:36.214 --> 42:38.716
I think I've got it.

42:38.718 --> 42:39.767
You'll be...

42:39.769 --> 42:42.753
Mr. Reese.

42:51.279 --> 42:52.897
After all that,

42:52.899 --> 42:54.114
he goes in the ground

42:54.116 --> 42:57.985
under a name
that isn't even his.

42:57.987 --> 43:01.104
The German government will sweep
the whole thing under the rug.

43:01.106 --> 43:03.707
And Ulrich Kohl never existed.

43:03.709 --> 43:05.609
I always thought I'd die

43:05.611 --> 43:09.463
in a place
that didn't know my name.

43:09.465 --> 43:13.717
You think anyone
will care for our names?

43:13.719 --> 43:17.221
After we're dead.

43:17.223 --> 43:20.391
I thought we already were.
