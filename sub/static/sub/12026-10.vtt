<i>...and it's a tall order.</i>

13:56.570 --> 13:57.402

13:57.404 --> 14:00.205
We're really heavy, eh?

14:00.207 --> 14:04.375
<i>I'm maxed right out.</i>
<i>It's 80 grand.</i>

because it's been really warm.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.593
The sun is out, all the frost
is starting to come out of this

14:21.595 --> 14:24.629

<i>It's not good.</i>

14:27.067 --> 14:28.967

<i>be the roughest one yet.</i>

14:39.478 --> 14:41.713
Just look at this.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.215
I'm supposed to hold on to that
for three hours?

14:44.217 --> 14:45.884
I'm just going to let it pop
all around the place

14:45.886 --> 14:50.054

head for the woods.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.891

<i>Well, we've got a big hill</i>
<i>coming up here.</i>

14:57.430 --> 14:59.797
You need to get a good run

14:59.799 --> 15:03.167
Going up this (bleep) thing
is gonna be a trip.

15:03.169 --> 15:07.772

16:37.630 --> 16:39.664

Yeah, wow is right.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.273
Yeah.

16:49.275 --> 16:52.410

17:52.137 --> 17:54.539
(Tires crunch, chains clink)

<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>As the thaw melts the surface,</i>
<i>the ice shrinks</i>

<i>and the water level below</i>
<i>rises,</i>

18:09.389 --> 18:12.123

<i>on the ice</i>

<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>Today, temperatures are soaring</i>

<i>heating up the ice</i>
<i>under the midday sun,</i>

18:59.839 --> 19:02.140
<i>and the 40 tonne load</i>
<i>could be too much</i>

19:05.545 --> 19:08.279
<i>Art:</i>
<i>We've just gotta break it</i>
<i>through the surface ice.</i>

19:08.281 --> 19:11.949
At least this time
it's just the surface ice.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.384
Of course this is how it
started out the last time

19:13.386 --> 19:15.353
I went out on the ice

<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>The falling muskeg could do</i>
<i>more than just slow him down...</i>

23:18.097 --> 23:20.598
<i>It could snag his rig</i>

<i>his truck and load</i>

23:32.211 --> 23:34.779
The thaw came a lot faster
than I expected it.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.213

27:54.640 --> 27:57.074
As it comes up, it starts
making the road shiny

27:57.076 --> 28:00.377

the road.

from it

31:13.873 --> 31:16.740

Make sure he's okay.

31:20.812 --> 31:23.614
<i>My poor old bulldog.</i>

31:23.616 --> 31:25.148
If either one of us
was going faster,

31:25.150 --> 31:27.651
it would have been a heck of
a lot more damage than that.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.519
You hit a fuel truck,

this is going to be a big fire.
(laughs)

31:34.293 --> 31:36.727

pretty minor.

most people on this planet
never get a chance to do.

38:52.864 --> 38:55.765
Have we got water splashing up?

38:55.767 --> 38:57.000
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I've seen the Arctic Ocean</i>

38:57.002 --> 38:58.635
<i>and drove on the Mackenzie</i>
<i>River.</i>

38:58.637 --> 39:02.739
I've seen so much of northern
Canada and the northern U.S.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.407
<i>and the people that live there</i>

39:04.409 --> 39:05.709
<i>that I would never</i>
<i>have gotten to see</i>

39:05.711 --> 39:07.644
if I didn't drive
on the ice roads.

39:07.646 --> 39:10.146
(Laughing)

39:10.148 --> 39:13.516
So that's what the ice roads
have done for me.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.518
- Mike, you know, rookie year,

39:15.520 --> 39:19.856
you kicked some butt out there.
<i>You know, I'm really happy.</i>

39:19.858 --> 39:21.057
<i>Mike:</i>
<i>It's not how many times</i>
<i>you get stuck,</i>

39:21.059 --> 39:23.493
<i>it's how you get yourself</i>
<i>out of it.</i>

39:23.495 --> 39:26.463
<i>Come on, move!</i>

39:26.465 --> 39:29.733
<i>I think I definitely put my</i>
<i>stamp on the ice roads this</i>
<i>season.</i>

39:29.735 --> 39:34.637
When it's all said and done,
and my life story is written,

39:34.639 --> 39:37.607
this is definitely going
to be a big part of it.

39:37.609 --> 39:40.643
Whoo-hooo!

39:40.645 --> 39:43.346
I want to be known
as a good father,

39:43.348 --> 39:46.916
a good family man...
and a kick ass trucker.

39:47.985 --> 39:49.886
- And Art, you know,
in the end of the day

39:49.888 --> 39:53.323
I asked you to step up
and you did.

39:53.325 --> 39:55.892
<i>Art:</i>
<i>No-no-no-no-no!</i>

39:55.894 --> 39:58.628
We broke through the (bleep)
ice, man!

39:58.630 --> 39:59.829
(Water bubbles)

40:00.998 --> 40:02.599
<i>Art:</i>
<i>Best season yet.</i>

40:02.601 --> 40:04.534
That's why I come here,
for the rush.

40:04.536 --> 40:09.272
Come on baby, come on baby,
come on baby, come on baby.

40:09.274 --> 40:11.741
This year I got a (bleep)
good one.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.977
(Chuckles)

40:13.979 --> 40:15.678
- At the end of the day, Art,

40:15.680 --> 40:17.747
thanks for not wreckin' a truck
again this season.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.949
(Laughing, clapping)

40:19.951 --> 40:21.951
Cheers, guys! Thank you!

40:21.953 --> 40:24.788
Good one!
Whoooo!

40:24.790 --> 40:26.589
(Clapping)

40:37.234 --> 40:39.302
(Honking)

40:45.409 --> 40:49.045
Mark:
Well, well... what's up,
Darrell?

40:49.047 --> 40:51.281
- How's it goin', Mark?

40:51.283 --> 40:53.516
- A little different rig
for you.

40:53.518 --> 40:55.885
- Yeah. Still diesel.
- Yeah.

40:55.887 --> 40:58.421
(Laughing)
Right on.

40:58.423 --> 41:00.423
- Things melted off pretty
quick this year.

41:00.425 --> 41:03.359
I feel like I was pretty lucky
to get one what I got done.

41:03.361 --> 41:07.530
I mean I was impressed with
what you guys accomplished
this year, you know.

41:07.532 --> 41:10.700
You gave me a run for money,
like you promised.

41:10.702 --> 41:12.268
- Did you expect anything less?

41:12.270 --> 41:14.204
- Ah, not really.
Not out of you, Darrell.

41:14.206 --> 41:15.872
I mean, you go hard
just like I do.

41:15.874 --> 41:17.941
In the end of the day you know
what, we did what was important

41:17.943 --> 41:20.076
and we got all the supplies to
the communities that needed it.

41:20.078 --> 41:22.745
So, you know, as long as you
and I are on that common goal,

41:22.747 --> 41:24.247
I think we'll just get along
fine.

41:24.249 --> 41:28.518
You know what, I'll be seeing
you next year whether you want
it or not.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.386
- Oh yeah, yeah.
(Darrell chuckles)

41:30.388 --> 41:33.022
- All right, talk to you later.
- Have a safe trip home.

41:37.695 --> 41:42.232
<i>Narrator:</i>
<i>As the book is closed</i>
<i>on a legendary season,</i>

41:42.234 --> 41:45.768
<i>the drivers head their</i>
<i>separate ways</i>

41:45.770 --> 41:51.207
<i>and they've lived to tell the</i>
<i>tale of surviving on thin ice.</i>

41:51.209 --> 41:53.810
(Engine roars)

41:53.812 --> 41:57.780
<i>Todd:</i>
<i>Driving these ice roads</i>
<i>is an absolute blessing.</i>

41:57.782 --> 41:59.816
Not everybody gets
to go up there

41:59.818 --> 42:03.553
and see what the good Lord
has actually built.

42:05.890 --> 42:08.291
<i>Darrell:</i>
<i>I love the challenge</i>
<i>of these roads.</i>

42:08.293 --> 42:11.928
<i>and send me 2,000 miles</i>
<i>down the pavement.</i>

42:11.930 --> 42:15.365
I'll take the hundred miles
of hell first.

42:15.367 --> 42:17.166
(Splashing)

42:19.370 --> 42:21.704
I'm not good at very much.

42:21.706 --> 42:24.507
But I can drive a truck.

42:24.509 --> 42:28.244
Trucking is not a job,
it is a lifestyle.

42:28.246 --> 42:30.446
And I'm so thankful
for trucking.

42:30.448 --> 42:32.749
I can't imagine my life
without it.
