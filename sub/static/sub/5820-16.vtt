(whistling )

00:05.320 --> 00:08.005
( panting )

00:42.120 --> 00:44.885
- Morgan: Hey.
- ( whickers )

00:45.040 --> 00:47.122
Hey;

00:49.440 --> 00:51.920
- ( horse snorts )
- Oh, you're fine.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.646
You are fine.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.370
<i>He'! '</i>

00:59.520 --> 01:02.251
Hey, come here.

01:02.400 --> 01:06.291
You... are alive.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.045
( Groans )

01:49.200 --> 01:50.645
(whistling )

01:50.800 --> 01:53.849
( panting )

01:54.000 --> 01:56.970
(whistling continues )

02:01.040 --> 02:03.441
Glenn's still not back.
I need to be there for Maggie.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.802
- I said no.
- Carl.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.203
Look, you were wrong before.
This place isn't too big to protect.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.601
And you need to stay back
and help protect it.

02:11.760 --> 02:13.091
This place is ready.

02:13.240 --> 02:15.561
Most of us have been trained,
you know that.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.087
If you were worried about an attack,
you wouldn't be leaving.

02:18.280 --> 02:21.887
You know how far the Hilltop is?
You know what could happen?

02:22.040 --> 02:26.045
- ( Whistling continues )
- Carl: Those Saviors are out there.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.929
You know
what they did to Denise,

02:28.120 --> 02:31.920
what they tried to do
with Maggie and Carol,

02:32.080 --> 02:35.084
to Daryl, to Rosita,
to Eugene.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.088
That's not happening to you,
all right?

02:39.240 --> 02:41.129
I'm not gonna let it.

02:53.080 --> 02:56.129
- Sasha: Any change?
- Rick: She's getting worse.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.401
Abraham:
Good call on the transport.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.289
Well, I figured
she'd be more comfortable.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.851
Abraham: It also means
you got room for more.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.767
They're out there,
so I'm gonna be there with you.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.729
We are.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.245
Package deal.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.004
( Sighs )

03:11.160 --> 03:13.003
Uh, what she said.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.768
You want
to run into them, right?

03:22.600 --> 03:25.126
You hope they show up.

03:27.280 --> 03:30.966
Jesus, this is about getting Maggie
to a doctor, not about--

03:33.000 --> 03:37.642
- Screw you, I'm going.
- Enid, stop. Just wait.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.802
Look, it's a long trip,
and you're just getting over--

03:39.960 --> 03:42.122
It's a superficial graze,
proteins are binding,

03:42.320 --> 03:43.924
plus we need to discuss
ammunition production

03:44.080 --> 03:46.651
and manufacture, so let's roll.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.485
I already tried. Give him an inch,
he's taking a mile.

03:49.640 --> 03:53.008
I'm only asking for 23, give or take,
depending on the route.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.003
I know I can be of some help.

03:55.160 --> 03:57.481
Now's the time
and here's the place.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.244
Don't shine me.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.641
I'll be your anchorman.
Yes, I damn will.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.451
( Runner panting )

04:16.279 --> 04:18.362
Man:
Why the face?

04:18.519 --> 04:21.728
I hope you're not
putting this on us.

04:21.880 --> 04:24.690
Huh? I mean, we showed
your people the way forward.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.649
We gave you rules.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.849
You broke the rules,
so folks had to die.

04:31.080 --> 04:32.764
The one who fired the first shot,
we strung him up

04:32.920 --> 04:34.763
to make an example of him.

04:34.960 --> 04:37.281
It could've stopped there.

04:37.440 --> 04:41.286
But you people
still didn't listen.

04:41.440 --> 04:44.523
You wanted to fight us.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.725
- So this is how it has to be.
- ( grunts )

04:48.880 --> 04:51.326
Get out of my way.
Carl!

04:51.480 --> 04:54.051
( Sighs )

04:54.200 --> 04:55.725
Just grab some pistols
from the closet.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.406
But hurry.
We've gotta go now.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.686
- ( Door closes )
- ( furniture scrapes )

05:08.840 --> 05:10.410
( doorknob rattles )

05:10.560 --> 05:14.246
Carl! Damn it!

05:14.400 --> 05:17.609
Please, please.
No, no, please-- oh! No!

05:17.760 --> 05:20.843
( Groaning )
Please, don't. Oh! Please.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.129
( Grunting )
Please!

05:24.280 --> 05:26.726
Carl! Carl!

05:30.600 --> 05:33.080
What happens
if you don't come back?

05:34.280 --> 05:36.123
How am I supposed
to live with that?

05:36.280 --> 05:38.601
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

05:41.280 --> 05:43.044
Just survive somehow.

05:43.200 --> 05:47.285
( Banging )

05:47.440 --> 05:49.727
Aaron: We're ready
to protect this place

05:49.880 --> 05:52.884
and the Saviors know it.
That's why they grabbed Eugene.

05:53.080 --> 05:56.323
Look, it's not up
for discussion.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.165
Then you're just gonna
have to punch me in the face

05:59.320 --> 06:01.448
and tie me up again.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.602
'Cause that's what
it's gonna take to stop me.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.962
( Silent)
Go on.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.603
Gabriel: We have 24-hour shifts
set up on each of the watchtowers,

06:19.760 --> 06:22.445
each one of them
fully supplied and ready.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.170
In the case
that we're incurred upon,

06:24.360 --> 06:26.806
we have drivers assigned,
evacuation and distraction,

06:26.960 --> 06:29.486
and the rendezvous
we discussed.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.961
In the event
of any emergency,

06:32.160 --> 06:34.925
my first priority is Judith.

06:35.120 --> 06:38.124
I will not fail you.

06:38.280 --> 06:42.080
Are you comfortable leaving me
in charge of Alexandria's defense?

06:49.480 --> 06:51.881
Yes.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.202
Hey, Rick.

06:54.360 --> 06:57.762
If the Saviors do show up...

06:57.920 --> 07:01.163
I don't know, I'm thinking,
if it's not too late,

07:01.320 --> 07:04.051
should we try and make
some kind of deal?

07:04.200 --> 07:06.407
Tell them to wait for me.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.803
I got a deal for 'em.
Let's go.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.285
( Gate squeaking )

07:23.240 --> 07:25.402
( gate clangs )

07:47.240 --> 07:49.368
Whoa, whoa.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.407
( Horse whickers )

08:01.280 --> 08:03.567
Morgan:
Carol?

08:06.160 --> 08:08.162
<i>He'! '</i>

08:11.040 --> 08:13.281
(whispers )
I told you not to come.

08:13.440 --> 08:17.081
And I'm gonna start
listening to you real soon.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.481
Here, let me see.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.131
(groaning )

08:56.440 --> 08:58.283
What is this?

08:58.440 --> 09:02.843
This is us about to make
an example outta you.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.480
To who?
My people--

09:05.640 --> 09:08.246
everyone at the library,
they're dead.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.842
( Grunts, coughs )

09:12.000 --> 09:14.890
(man groaning )

09:29.800 --> 09:32.644

10:34.920 --> 10:37.764
<i>. HEY-
. HQV-</i>

10:37.920 --> 10:40.730
We're gonna get there.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.884
The doctor at the Hilltop,

10:44.080 --> 10:45.969
he's gonna make things better.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.611
<i>He'! '</i>

10:54.760 --> 10:56.967
How do you know?

10:57.120 --> 11:02.081
Everything we've done,
we've done together.

11:02.240 --> 11:05.483
We got here together
and we're still here.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.207
Things have happened,
but it's always worked out for us

11:10.360 --> 11:12.886
'cause it's always been
all of us.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.281
That's how I know.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.485
'Cause as long as it's
all of us,

11:20.640 --> 11:22.768
we can do anything.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.965

<i>'</i> ( gasps )

11:43.360 --> 11:46.489
It's a walker.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.125
It's hard to get.

11:48.280 --> 11:52.808
I was going to,
but I was too busy bleeding.

11:52.960 --> 11:56.203
- ( Chuckles )
- ( clanging continues )

11:56.400 --> 11:59.051
Pressure should help,
but you need stitches,

11:59.200 --> 12:02.568
antibiotics to make sure
you don't get an infection.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.609
Be dark in a few hours.

12:11.760 --> 12:15.481
I'll walk the camp, make sure
we're safe for the night.

12:15.640 --> 12:18.405
And at dawn,
we will head back,

12:18.560 --> 12:20.847
get you some help.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.002
Okay?

12:25.120 --> 12:27.043
No.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.890
What the bitch?

12:57.880 --> 13:01.726
- Rick: What?
- Enemy close.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.849
Abraham:
We doing this?

13:11.080 --> 13:13.447
No.

13:13.640 --> 13:16.166
( Gearshift clicks )

13:45.920 --> 13:48.161
Savior: He's someone who was
with a whole lot of someones

13:48.320 --> 13:50.288
who didn't listen.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.206
We can make a deal

13:56.360 --> 13:59.170
right here, right now.

13:59.320 --> 14:03.166
That's right, we can.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.840
Give us all your stuff.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.606
We'll probably have to kill one of you.
That's just the way it is,

14:08.760 --> 14:12.162
but then we can start
moving forward on business.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.130
All you have to do is listen.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.966
Yeah...

14:21.120 --> 14:23.726
that deal's
not gonna work for us.

14:23.920 --> 14:27.447
Fact is, I was about to ask
for all of your stuff,

14:27.600 --> 14:31.685
only I'm thinking
I don't have to kill any of you.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.923
Any more of you.

14:37.640 --> 14:40.484
( Can rattling )

14:45.560 --> 14:47.688
( hisses )

15:01.320 --> 15:05.848
Savior: Sorry,
my deal is the only deal.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.287
We don't negotiate.

15:12.480 --> 15:15.643
Me and my people
are leaving.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.808
Okay, friend.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.964
Plenty of ways to get
to where you're going.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.446
You want to make today
your last day on earth?

15:37.320 --> 15:38.651
No,

15:38.800 --> 15:41.371
but that is a good thing
to bring up.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.924
Think about it.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.931
What if it's the last day
on earth for you?

15:50.360 --> 15:52.169
For someone you love?

15:52.320 --> 15:54.163
What if that's true?

15:57.280 --> 16:00.887
Maybe you should be extra nice
to those people in that RV,

16:01.040 --> 16:03.202
'cause you never know...
( snaps fingers )

16:03.360 --> 16:05.601
just like that.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.324
Be kind to each other.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.403
Like you said...

16:13.800 --> 16:16.041
like it was
your last day on earth.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.321
You do the same.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.562
( Door closes )

16:34.400 --> 16:36.164
( groans )

16:41.440 --> 16:44.125

- ( people panting )

17:04.640 --> 17:07.450
( muffled voices continue )

17:31.240 --> 17:33.607
Why didn't you stay back
and help guard the place?

17:37.600 --> 17:39.489
I owe her.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.643
Aaron:
Why did you come?

17:46.480 --> 17:48.926
I owe them.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.809
(tapping )

17:52.360 --> 17:56.649
- Logrun Road's a straight shot.
- Sasha: We want visibility.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.321
There, you got it on Shelton.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.086
Golf course, country clubs,
sloping terrain.

18:05.240 --> 18:08.449
No bum rush from the bogeymen.
We'd see 'em from a good piece.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.931
It is a longer trip by a third,

18:10.080 --> 18:11.969
but we'd get the scenic safety

18:12.120 --> 18:13.929
of clear-cut dingles
and glens.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.205
You're being serious, right?

18:18.360 --> 18:20.567
As coronary thrombosis.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.051
- You got a route?
- Yeah.

18:22.240 --> 18:25.244
(walker thumping,
growling )

18:25.400 --> 18:27.084
Let's go.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.850
Wasn't just me.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.002
Rick came looking, too.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.609
Daryl, some of the others...

18:57.000 --> 18:59.446
they would've.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.683
They were gone
before they even knew about you.

19:02.840 --> 19:05.571
- Gone?
- They'll be back by the time we are.

19:05.720 --> 19:09.566
Probably back already,
wondering.

19:09.720 --> 19:12.405
You think I'm being
dramatic here?

19:14.640 --> 19:16.085
Do you really think
you could just come here

19:16.240 --> 19:18.766
and tell me to come back
and that's how it'll go?

19:22.280 --> 19:25.887
Those people, your people,

19:26.040 --> 19:27.371
they care about you.

19:27.560 --> 19:30.848
I know they do.
And I care about them.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.971
- That's why I can't be there.
- That's why you have to be there.

19:35.120 --> 19:37.805
- ( Faint clanging )
- ( faint growling)

19:37.960 --> 19:40.645
Do you really just not get it?

19:43.640 --> 19:45.927
After everything that's happened?

19:51.200 --> 19:54.443
If you care about people,
there are people to protect.

19:54.600 --> 19:58.082
There are people
that you will kill for.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.768
If you don't want to kill...

20:03.240 --> 20:05.811
or if you can't...

20:07.360 --> 20:10.284
then you have
to get away from them.

20:10.440 --> 20:14.286
You do not get both.
You-- you should know that.

20:15.640 --> 20:18.120
No, everything's about people.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.328
Everything in this life
that's worth a damn,

20:21.480 --> 20:23.289
that's what I know.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.642
And out here on your own...

20:30.760 --> 20:33.809
you'll die.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.322
- Then let me die.
- No, I can't do that.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.887
It's not your decision.
Just go.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.525
I'm not leaving you.

20:44.720 --> 20:47.371
(gun hammer clicks)

20:47.520 --> 20:50.000
I said go.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.409
( Softly )
Please, just go.

21:11.280 --> 21:15.968
If you care about anyone, M--

21:17.680 --> 21:21.446
there is a price, Morgan,
and you're gonna pay it.

21:23.040 --> 21:26.010
I have, and I can't anymore.

21:37.240 --> 21:40.562
- ( Faint snarling )
- ( faint clanging )

21:48.080 --> 21:49.445
Abraham:
Think we could do it?

21:49.600 --> 21:52.080
What?

21:53.280 --> 21:57.205
What they did,
Glenn and Maggie?

22:02.040 --> 22:04.407
Just asking
if you could do that.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.167
If you're doing something
as big as that...

22:11.640 --> 22:13.244
if that's living.

22:16.040 --> 22:18.042
Could you?

22:22.000 --> 22:23.684
Yeah.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.922
I could.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.889
Now.

22:46.040 --> 22:48.042
Just so you know.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.003
Bitch nuts.

23:08.840 --> 23:11.081
We making our stand?

23:14.040 --> 23:17.169
Yeah, we end it.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.607
No, not now.

23:22.760 --> 23:25.491
Rick: They've been waiting.
They're ready.

23:25.640 --> 23:27.165
With one of us
behind the wheel,

23:27.320 --> 23:31.723
that's five on 16.

23:31.880 --> 23:35.680
We're gonna play it our way,
how we want it.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.604
Right?

23:38.800 --> 23:40.006
Right.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.045
All right, go slow.

23:44.200 --> 23:46.487
( Gearshift clicks )

23:51.560 --> 23:53.562
( gunshots echo )

24:04.360 --> 24:06.283
( gunshots echo )

24:12.440 --> 24:14.602
( gunshots echo )

24:26.120 --> 24:28.885
(walkers growling )

24:48.320 --> 24:51.130
(growling )

25:02.000 --> 25:04.480
(walkers growling )

25:04.640 --> 25:07.007
( growling continues )

25:12.120 --> 25:14.282
( rattling )

( snarling )

25:49.120 --> 25:51.691
( faint scraping )

25:51.840 --> 25:54.161
( body thumps)

26:01.960 --> 26:04.327
( faint growling )

26:12.760 --> 26:14.330
Carol?

26:24.200 --> 26:26.521
Carol?

26:29.840 --> 26:32.161
Carol?

26:32.360 --> 26:35.170
( Horse whickers )

26:42.160 --> 26:44.401
( gate clangs )

26:48.160 --> 26:50.208
Let's go.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.762
(walkers growling )

27:15.720 --> 27:18.644
- Rick: How are we on gas?
- Abraham: Half a tank.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.371
I pulled some more cans
before we left.

27:21.520 --> 27:24.729
Those weren't the same men
who blocked the road the first time.

27:24.880 --> 27:27.884
Same outfit, different soldiers.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.571
They got numbers.

27:32.720 --> 27:35.530
Yeah, we keep driving,
we get her there.

27:35.680 --> 27:37.728
We will.

27:37.920 --> 27:41.720
If we have to shove each and every
one of 'em up their own asses.

27:44.440 --> 27:47.091
( Brakes squeal )

27:47.240 --> 27:49.402
( Rick sighs )

27:53.920 --> 27:55.922
(walkers growling )

27:58.320 --> 28:00.004
We can't go through it.

28:00.160 --> 28:02.561
Can't risk the RV.

28:02.720 --> 28:05.200
You stay behind the wheel,
just in case.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.806
(gun clicks)

28:07.960 --> 28:09.564
We'll clear it.

28:09.720 --> 28:12.564
- ( Walkers snarling )
- ( chains rattling )

28:33.120 --> 28:36.488
Eugene: Putting together
a "red rover" like that takes people.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.808
A lot of them.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.488
(snafls)

28:53.640 --> 28:55.802
Come on, let's do this.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.048
Dad...

28:58.200 --> 29:00.168
That's Michonne's.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.323
That's Daryl's.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.729
( Automatic gunfire crackles )

29:49.800 --> 29:51.802
Get back to the RV!
Go!

29:51.960 --> 29:54.770
( Gunfire continues )

30:13.200 --> 30:15.168
Abraham:
Start it up!

30:23.560 --> 30:25.244
( RV door closes )

30:48.520 --> 30:51.091
- ( faint squeal )
- Sasha: What's that sound?

30:51.280 --> 30:53.169
Eugene: Undercarriage
could've caught a bullet.

30:53.320 --> 30:56.608
Or could be transmission.
It could be nothing.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.001
They were firing at our feet.

30:59.160 --> 31:00.764
( RV squealing )

31:00.960 --> 31:02.644
They blocked the road,
but they weren't trying to stop us.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.644
They want us in this direction.

31:05.840 --> 31:08.889
Barton Road takes us north,
but they gotta know we wanna go north.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.769
Meadows.
Could take us east a piece,

31:10.920 --> 31:12.843
but we can get back on track
on Mayhew.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.162
We're down to a third of a tank.
We could top off at the next stop,

31:15.320 --> 31:17.800
- but no refills after that.
- Rick: All right.

31:19.240 --> 31:22.130
She's burning up.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.169
( RV squeals )

31:29.880 --> 31:33.805
- ( RV squeals )
- Abraham: Rick.

31:41.680 --> 31:44.684
( Brakes squealing )

31:49.560 --> 31:52.484
Go back.

31:52.680 --> 31:54.523
Where?

32:28.640 --> 32:30.449
Whoa, whoa.

32:39.360 --> 32:40.964
Whoa.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.888
Come on.
( clucks )

32:48.040 --> 32:50.327
(walkers growling )

32:53.880 --> 32:56.770
( panting )

(walker snarling,
banging )

33:38.440 --> 33:40.204
( snarling )

33:40.360 --> 33:42.601
No, get away.

33:42.760 --> 33:45.331
(grunting )

33:47.840 --> 33:49.729
Ah!

33:58.720 --> 34:00.006
Ah!

34:00.160 --> 34:02.322
( Panting )

34:02.480 --> 34:04.130
(yells )

34:13.120 --> 34:15.521
Hey;

34:15.679 --> 34:16.806
No, no.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.889
( Grunts, panting )

34:28.280 --> 34:30.009
( hammer clicks )

34:30.159 --> 34:33.641
Each breath is getting harder.

34:35.120 --> 34:37.282
I probably don't have
too many more in me.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.051
So I'm gonna make
each one count.

34:43.360 --> 34:47.081
So here's how it's gonna go.

34:47.239 --> 34:52.167
You're gonna lie there
and I'm gonna watch you die slow,

34:52.360 --> 34:56.409
just like my friends did
back on that road.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.608
Just like I'm gonna.

35:00.120 --> 35:03.010
Let's see who wins, bitch.

35:03.200 --> 35:06.249
-(gunshot)
- ( groaning)

35:09.960 --> 35:11.644
You see there?

35:11.800 --> 35:14.326
That's a pretty good start, huh?

35:14.480 --> 35:16.244
Huh?

35:24.480 --> 35:26.881
( People panting )

35:29.200 --> 35:31.089
( muffled voices )

35:33.280 --> 35:37.649
( muffled voices continue )

35:37.800 --> 35:41.088
- ( RV squealing)
- Are we close?

35:41.280 --> 35:44.329
Yeah, we're--
we're getting there.

35:44.480 --> 35:47.882
Were there-- I heard shots.

35:48.080 --> 35:52.085
Yeah, the Saviors,
but they're gone.

35:52.240 --> 35:56.689
We are--
we're gonna get you there.

35:56.880 --> 35:59.645
I know.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.922
You're gonna be okay.

36:02.080 --> 36:04.651
The baby's gonna be okay.
This isn't it.

36:04.800 --> 36:08.407
This isn't it. There's more.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.250
There's gonna be more.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.084
( RV squealing )

36:12.240 --> 36:14.402
I believe in you, Rick.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.602
( Panting )

36:23.760 --> 36:27.162
(laughing)

36:31.320 --> 36:34.688
What do you got
to smile about, bitch?

36:34.840 --> 36:36.683
What the hell's wrong with you?

36:36.880 --> 36:41.602
( Carol laughing )
There's nothing wrong with me.

36:41.800 --> 36:45.407
I'm gonna die, so...

36:45.560 --> 36:47.961
there's nothing wrong
with me anymore.

36:58.920 --> 37:01.002
- ( Gunshot )
- ( screams )

37:04.120 --> 37:07.647
You think you've suffered
enough now?

37:10.200 --> 37:12.806
No, probably not.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.322
Oh, God.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.847
( M utters )

37:26.000 --> 37:29.004
Carol:
What, are you done?

37:29.160 --> 37:32.846
Unless you kill me now,
I'm not gonna die!

37:33.000 --> 37:35.890
(walker growling )

37:36.040 --> 37:38.122
You decide!

37:41.040 --> 37:44.840
The world doesn't decide!
You decide!

37:45.000 --> 37:48.209
You don't get to walk away

37:48.360 --> 37:51.204
and get what you want!

37:54.520 --> 37:56.841
( Panting )

37:58.480 --> 38:00.448
- Morgan: Stop.
- ( hammer clicks )

38:03.920 --> 38:05.410
Drop it.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.008
You can survive this.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.322
You can.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.407
Drop it.

38:18.920 --> 38:21.366
Please.

38:21.520 --> 38:22.521
No.

38:22.680 --> 38:27.083
( Gunshots )

38:41.200 --> 38:44.841
Would you please
just let me go?

38:45.000 --> 38:48.721
Hey, it's not your time.

38:48.880 --> 38:51.326
You are gonna come back
from this.

38:55.840 --> 38:59.003
- ( Horse whickering )
- ( hoof beats approaching )

39:01.680 --> 39:03.569
What happened here?

39:09.920 --> 39:12.082
I found your horse.

39:14.360 --> 39:16.522
Found my friend, too.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.407
She needs help.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.163
Then let's get you some help.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.642
These tracks...

39:52.800 --> 39:54.370
they would indicate
they not only have people,

39:54.520 --> 39:56.522
but some big-ass toys
and capabilities.

39:56.680 --> 39:58.364
What it indicates
is we are neck-deep

39:58.520 --> 40:02.320
up shit creek
with our mouths wide open.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.443
( Screams )

40:06.600 --> 40:08.648
(gasping. gassing )

40:08.840 --> 40:11.730
- Abraham: Don't.
- I can try and break the chain.

40:11.880 --> 40:13.006
It won't work.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.925
- Aaron: I can try.
- It won't work.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.003
( Man gagging )

40:19.760 --> 40:22.491
And we need the bullets.

40:27.600 --> 40:30.126
( Man gagging )

40:51.760 --> 40:54.047
( crackling )

40:58.200 --> 41:01.522
Savior: You're treating
your people good, right?

41:01.680 --> 41:04.684
Like it was
your last day on earth?

41:04.840 --> 41:07.081
Or maybe one of theirs?

41:09.520 --> 41:13.161
You better go.
It's gonna get hot.

41:13.360 --> 41:16.204
You go get
where you're going.

41:16.360 --> 41:19.045
Go, go.

41:25.720 --> 41:27.529
Get on.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.845
( Engine starts )

41:52.080 --> 41:55.163
( locusts chirping )

41:56.880 --> 42:00.168
Abraham:
So, what's the play?

42:00.320 --> 42:03.290
She needs a doctor.

42:03.440 --> 42:07.286
Sasha: There are two more routes
north from here.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.886
They're probably
waiting for us right now.

42:14.520 --> 42:18.844
So, they're ahead of us,
probably behind us.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.209
But they're not
waiting on us, per se,

42:22.360 --> 42:25.682
they're waiting
on this rust bucket.

42:25.840 --> 42:28.605
And they don't know
the moment-to-moment occupancy

42:28.760 --> 42:30.683
of said rust bucket.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.047
And the sun sets soon.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.606
That's the last of it.

42:55.800 --> 42:58.485
If you see a car,
try to siphon the gas.

42:58.640 --> 43:00.927
Other than that,
you keep moving.

43:01.080 --> 43:03.082
I'll have 'em thinking
we're playing their game.

43:03.240 --> 43:05.766
All phases of the turn,
level after level,

43:05.920 --> 43:07.684
move after move,
I'll keep 'em spun.

43:07.840 --> 43:10.207
I assure you, I will.

43:12.120 --> 43:14.771
I got something for you.

43:14.920 --> 43:18.561
It's a recipe,
and it ain't gazpacho.

43:21.840 --> 43:24.571
"How to Build Bullets 101."

43:24.720 --> 43:27.724
Abraham can show you where,
just in case.

43:33.480 --> 43:37.041
Thank you for this.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.328
For all of it.

43:41.560 --> 43:43.927
We're lucky you're here.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.367
I won't argue with that.

43:46.560 --> 43:48.210
( Chuckles )

43:52.120 --> 43:53.929
You go steady on the pedal.

43:54.080 --> 43:55.764
You don't make that thing gulp.

43:57.840 --> 44:00.810
How come you never
let me drive the truck?

44:05.400 --> 44:07.402
I didn't think you could do it.

44:11.480 --> 44:13.847
I was wrong.

44:14.040 --> 44:16.327
You're a survivor.

44:17.680 --> 44:20.763
You always were.

44:20.920 --> 44:23.321
We just didn't know it.

44:25.760 --> 44:28.240
Me and you both.

44:57.440 --> 44:59.442
Thank you.

45:41.480 --> 45:43.847
( Engine starts )

45:46.920 --> 45:49.127
( RV squeals )

45:57.520 --> 46:01.002
(growling )

46:05.920 --> 46:07.763
( rustling )

46:07.920 --> 46:09.888
( footsteps approaching )

46:14.640 --> 46:16.847
Maggie:
Aaron, please.

46:17.040 --> 46:19.042
Just let me walk it.

46:19.200 --> 46:22.522
Relax.
Just a few more miles.

46:25.880 --> 46:28.929
Carl: I heard what you told her
when we were leaving.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.682
We can do anything,

46:33.840 --> 46:36.241
'cause we'll do
anything we need to do.

46:36.400 --> 46:40.086
We have... and we will.

46:43.440 --> 46:45.204
What happened to Denise,

46:45.400 --> 46:47.926
I'm not gonna let anybody die
like that again.

46:50.720 --> 46:52.449
- Son...
- What?

46:52.600 --> 46:56.127
(whistling echoes )

46:58.120 --> 47:00.771
(whistling )

47:07.680 --> 47:09.409
Go! Go!

47:09.560 --> 47:11.403
(whistling continues )

47:15.720 --> 47:17.961
(whistling continues )

47:25.920 --> 47:30.084
(whistling continues )

47:31.520 --> 47:32.567
Ah!

47:32.720 --> 47:36.281
( Mass whistling )

47:47.960 --> 47:50.247
(whistling continues )

47:58.640 --> 48:02.122
(whistling continues )

48:16.960 --> 48:19.281
(whistling fades )

48:47.640 --> 48:49.369
Savior:
Good.

48:49.520 --> 48:52.490
You made it.

48:53.680 --> 48:55.523
Welcome to
where you're going.

49:00.120 --> 49:03.283
We'll take your weapons.

49:03.440 --> 49:04.965
Now.

49:09.440 --> 49:13.001
- We can talk about it--
- We're done talking.

49:13.160 --> 49:15.208
Time to listen.

49:35.320 --> 49:37.482
That's yours, right?

49:39.360 --> 49:43.570
Yeah, it's yours.

49:48.960 --> 49:51.566
Okay.

49:51.720 --> 49:55.167
Let's get her down
and get you all on your knees.

49:56.680 --> 49:58.728
Lots to cover.

49:58.880 --> 50:00.928
Hold up.

50:01.080 --> 50:02.969
We got it.

50:03.120 --> 50:05.521
Sure, sure.

50:22.920 --> 50:25.924
( Gasping )

50:40.480 --> 50:43.131
Gonna need you
on your knees.

51:10.480 --> 51:12.767
( Panting )

51:18.360 --> 51:20.966
( mass panting )

51:25.480 --> 51:28.927
( muffled voice )
Let's get the other one. Right now.

51:30.200 --> 51:32.168
- Savior: Dwight!
- Yeah.

51:32.320 --> 51:34.448
Savior:
Chop-chop.

51:41.320 --> 51:44.767
Dwight: Come on.
You got people to meet.

51:55.200 --> 51:57.521
(grunting )

52:01.880 --> 52:03.848
Maggie...?

52:04.000 --> 52:06.002
Dwight:
On your knees!

52:14.880 --> 52:16.564
Savior:
All right!

52:16.720 --> 52:18.802
We got a full boat.

52:20.040 --> 52:23.726
Let's meet the man.
( knocks )

52:30.360 --> 52:32.601
( clatters )

52:40.960 --> 52:43.247
Pissing our pants yet?

52:48.360 --> 52:52.410
Boy, do I have a feeling
we're getting close.

52:59.360 --> 53:01.761
Yep.

53:01.920 --> 53:05.527
It's gonna be pee-pee pants city
here real soon.

53:08.560 --> 53:11.848
Which one of you pricks
is the leader?

53:12.040 --> 53:13.849
Savior:
It's this one.

53:15.240 --> 53:17.481
He's the guy.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.322
( Sighs )

53:28.280 --> 53:29.805
Hi.

53:29.960 --> 53:32.281
You're Rick, right?

53:32.440 --> 53:34.966
I'm Negan.

53:35.120 --> 53:39.489
And I do not appreciate
you killing my men.

53:39.640 --> 53:41.642
Also, when I sent
my people

53:41.800 --> 53:44.485
to kill your people
for killing my people,

53:44.640 --> 53:47.291
you killed more of my people.

53:48.800 --> 53:53.567
Not cool.

53:53.720 --> 53:57.088
You have no idea

53:57.240 --> 53:59.129
how not cool that shit is.

53:59.280 --> 54:03.490
But I think you're gonna be
up to speed shortly.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.002
Yeah.

54:09.520 --> 54:12.967
You are so gonna regret
crossing me in a few minutes.

54:15.680 --> 54:17.808
Yes, you are.

54:20.240 --> 54:23.005
You see, Rick,
whatever you do,

54:23.160 --> 54:26.369
no matter what, you don't mess
with the new world order.

54:26.520 --> 54:29.364
And the new world order is this,
and it's really very simple.

54:29.520 --> 54:32.967
So, even if you're stupid,
which you very may well be,

54:33.160 --> 54:35.561
you can understand it.

54:35.720 --> 54:38.041
You ready?

54:38.200 --> 54:41.886
Here goes.
Pay attention.

54:49.920 --> 54:52.730
Give me your shit...

54:52.880 --> 54:54.928
or I will kill you.

54:59.440 --> 55:01.568
Today was career day.

55:03.120 --> 55:04.884
We invested a lot

55:05.040 --> 55:08.123
so you would know who I am

55:08.320 --> 55:10.084
and what I can do.

55:11.560 --> 55:14.166
You work for me now.

55:14.320 --> 55:17.483
You have shit,
you give it to me.

55:17.640 --> 55:19.722
That's your job.

55:21.200 --> 55:25.444
Now, I know
that is a mighty big,

55:25.600 --> 55:28.251
nasty pill to swallow,

55:28.400 --> 55:33.770
but swallow it
you most certainly will.

55:37.920 --> 55:39.285
You ruled the roost.

55:39.480 --> 55:43.769
You built something.

55:45.600 --> 55:47.807
You thought you were safe.

55:47.960 --> 55:50.884
I get it.

55:51.040 --> 55:56.171
But the word is out.

55:56.320 --> 55:59.767
You are not safe.

56:01.560 --> 56:03.562
Not even close.

56:03.720 --> 56:06.007
In fact, you are pegged,

56:06.160 --> 56:07.889
more pegged
if you don't do what I want.

56:08.040 --> 56:10.805
And what I want
is half your shit.

56:10.960 --> 56:14.123
And if that's too much,
you can make, find, or steal more,

56:14.280 --> 56:16.886
and it'll even out
sooner or later.

56:19.400 --> 56:22.847
This is your way of life now.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.801
The more you fight back,
the harder it will be.

56:27.960 --> 56:32.568
So, if someone
knocks on your door...

56:33.840 --> 56:35.251
( chuckles )

56:35.400 --> 56:39.610
...you let us in.
We own that door.

56:39.760 --> 56:41.842
You try to stop us

56:42.040 --> 56:45.283
and we will knock it down.

56:47.960 --> 56:49.962
You understand?

56:53.280 --> 56:56.204
What, no answer?

56:59.320 --> 57:02.688
You don't really think
that you were gonna get through this

57:02.840 --> 57:04.968
without being punished,
now, did you?

57:07.160 --> 57:09.208
I don't want to kill you people.

57:09.400 --> 57:11.641
Just want to make that clear
from the get-go.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.968
I want you to work for me.

57:15.160 --> 57:19.324
You can't do that if you're dead,
now, can you?

57:22.280 --> 57:25.363
I'm not growing a garden.

57:28.200 --> 57:32.842
But you killed my people,
a whole damn lot of them.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.843
More than
I'm comfortable with.

57:35.000 --> 57:38.846
And for that,
for that you're gonna pay.

57:42.720 --> 57:44.882
So, now...

57:48.320 --> 57:52.450
I'm gonna beat the holy hell
outta one of you.

57:58.880 --> 58:01.087
This--

58:01.240 --> 58:03.811
this is Lucille,

58:04.000 --> 58:08.449
and she is awesome.

58:14.000 --> 58:19.689
All this, all this
is just so we can pick out

58:19.840 --> 58:23.401
which one of you
gets the honor.

58:28.120 --> 58:29.326
( Negan inhales sharply )

58:37.360 --> 58:39.010
Huh.

58:40.320 --> 58:42.527
Ugh, I gotta shave this shit.

58:49.120 --> 58:52.124
You got one of our guns.

58:55.640 --> 58:58.769
Whoa. Yeah.

58:58.920 --> 59:01.321
You got a lot of our guns.

59:04.680 --> 59:08.605
Shit, kid, lighten up.

59:10.240 --> 59:12.527
At least cry a little.

59:16.120 --> 59:17.770
( Chuckles )

59:20.440 --> 59:22.761
Ahem.

59:26.080 --> 59:27.764
( sniffs )

59:30.800 --> 59:33.007
Jesus.

59:33.160 --> 59:35.811
You look shitty.

59:37.680 --> 59:39.409
I should just put you
out of your misery right now.

59:39.560 --> 59:42.086
(Glel1n yells)
NO! NO!

59:42.240 --> 59:44.686
_( . pln - Stop it! g )

59:44.840 --> 59:48.731
God»!
( grunting )

59:48.880 --> 59:50.689
Nope.

59:50.840 --> 59:54.162
- Nope, get him back in line.
- Glenn: No.

59:54.360 --> 59:57.011
( Grunts )
No.

59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.562
No.
( groaning )

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.889
( sobs, yells )

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.208
Don't.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:14.046
- Don't.
- ( chuckles )

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.044
All right, listen.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:21.046
Don't any of ya do that again.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.886
I will shut that shit down,
no exceptions.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.161
First one's free.
It's an emotional moment,

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:32.324
I get it.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.607
Sucks, don't it?

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:53.481
The moment you realize
you don't know shit.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.085
This is your kid, right?

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.248
( laughs )

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.920
This is definitely your kid.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.084
- Just stop this!
- Hey!

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.762
Do not make me kill
the little future serial killer.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.287
Don't make it easy on me.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.891
I gotta pick somebody.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.801
Everybody's at the table
waiting for me to order.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.963
(whistling )

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:49.089
(whistling )

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.843
I simply cannot decide.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.684
( Chuckles )

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.527
I got an idea.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.005
( Chuckles )

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.004
Eenie...

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.570
meenie...

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.768
miney...

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.042
mo.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:30.729
Catch...

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.121
a tiger...

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.886
by...

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.963
his toe.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.248
If...

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:43.523
he hollers...

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.682
let him go.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.368
My mother...

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.567
told me...

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.051
to pick

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:56.450
the very best one...

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:59.365
and you...

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.371
8T6...

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.202
it.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.283
Anybody moves,
anybody says anything,

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.886
cut the boy's other eye out
and feed it to his father

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.008
and then we'll start.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.571
You can breathe,

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.210
you can blink,

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.368
you can cry.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.603
Hell, you're all
gonna be doing that.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.761
( All scream )

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:33.970
- ( shrill ringing)
- Negan: Ho! Ho!

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.561
Look at that.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.088
Taking it like a champ!

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.208
(thumps)

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.011
- ( whips)
- Negan: Damn!

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.606
(thumps)

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.130
(thumps)
