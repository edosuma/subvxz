WEBVTT

00:45.266 --> 00:47.966
I'll be back. I'm free!

00:51.133 --> 00:53.166
No!

01:27.266 --> 01:29.666
The dream always
starts the same.

01:29.733 --> 01:31.700
I come to school..

01:32.766 --> 01:34.733
...and I'm happy.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.633
I have an arm full
of my best work.

01:48.166 --> 01:50.100
The best work I've ever done.

01:53.433 --> 01:55.400
And it's all for her.

02:01.366 --> 02:02.933
She's incredible.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.466
And I think to myself

02:04.533 --> 02:06.633
when she sees the drawings,
I've done for her

02:06.700 --> 02:08.366
she'll love me..

02:08.433 --> 02:10.400
...as much as I love her.

02:18.366 --> 02:20.600
That's when everything
turns to crap.

02:23.333 --> 02:26.333
Hmm, next time dream that
she's the naked one.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.000
It'll help, trust me.

02:28.066 --> 02:31.133
If I just had the guts to
show her my stuff, you know.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.800
How many drawings
have you done of her?

02:32.866 --> 02:35.166
- Three hundred and fifty seven.
- Oh.

02:35.233 --> 02:36.400
Yeah, I spend half the night
doin' them and

02:36.466 --> 02:38.400
the other half
holdin' 'em up with one hand.

02:38.466 --> 02:40.200
What's the matter with you?
You wanna go blind?

02:40.266 --> 02:42.733
- No, but I want her.
- So ask her out.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.600
- Oh, come on, look at these--
- Arms.

02:44.666 --> 02:46.233
- I know, I have a set--
- No, no, no, no.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.133
See, these aren't arms.
These are called toothpicks.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.433
Now, her boyfriend,
he has arms, big ones.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.000
Normal ones.

02:53.066 --> 02:54.700
Forget that, dumb jock, will ya?

02:54.766 --> 02:57.666
Sure, he's got muscles
but you've got talent.

02:57.733 --> 02:59.133
And we're gonna put it to work.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.466
Oh, what, in this
underground paper of yours

03:01.533 --> 03:05.033
- What's it called?
- It's called"No mercy."

03:05.100 --> 03:08.100
And we're gonna explode
every silly campus cliche.

03:08.166 --> 03:10.766
Attack every outdated tradition.

03:10.833 --> 03:12.400
Especially those
blockhead jocks.

03:12.466 --> 03:14.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
those guys don't look like

03:14.266 --> 03:15.400
they have too much of
a sense of humor, Pete.

03:15.466 --> 03:17.200
Screw 'em if they
can't take a joke.

03:17.266 --> 03:19.866
That's why we're
underground, Jack.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.266
We're gonna tackle everything.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.033
From the faculty,
to the toxic waste

03:23.100 --> 03:24.133
they serve in the cafeteria.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.433
Yeah, but, jeez,
I don't do cartoons.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.533
So what?

03:27.600 --> 03:30.066
You're the best artist
in the whole school.

03:30.133 --> 03:32.500
Besides, look, we're gonna
do satirical stuff.

03:32.566 --> 03:34.166
Like, the New Yorker.

03:34.233 --> 03:36.366
- New Yorker?
- Yeah.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.600
Cool.

03:37.666 --> 03:40.500
Besides...it'll help
your confidence.

03:41.566 --> 03:43.566
- You think so?
- Yeah.

03:43.633 --> 03:44.733
Think about it.

03:45.700 --> 03:46.933
- Okay.
- Alright.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.566
'I got it, I got it. Alright.'

03:52.633 --> 03:53.600
'More.'

04:14.100 --> 04:15.166
Is that me?

04:15.233 --> 04:16.700
Uh, uh, no, no.

04:16.766 --> 04:18.000
It's just, uh, a sketch.

04:18.066 --> 04:19.333
Kind of, uh, a doodle
type thing that I do.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.500
It-it's nothing really.
Just a-a hobby that I have

04:21.566 --> 04:23.933
It's, um, you know,
just for fun kind of--

04:25.233 --> 04:27.200
Is this me?

04:28.233 --> 04:31.200
It's, uh...how I see you.

04:32.966 --> 04:35.200
What is this? Show and tell?

04:36.700 --> 04:38.333
Drop it, Ron.

04:41.900 --> 04:43.833
What, can't you get a real one?

04:53.933 --> 04:56.233
I guess not.

05:13.800 --> 05:14.966
Hey, hey, this is Jack.

05:15.033 --> 05:17.000
You know the routine,
leave it at the beep.

05:20.566 --> 05:22.000
'Hey, Jack, it's Pete.'

05:22.066 --> 05:23.733
'I heard about
you and Ron today.'

05:23.800 --> 05:26.766
'Don't sweat it, kid. The pen
is mightier than the sword.'

05:26.833 --> 05:28.700
'Let's talk about your
first cartoon tomorrow.'

05:28.766 --> 05:30.000
'See ya.'

05:46.133 --> 05:47.133
Yeah.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.633
'Alright!'

06:23.233 --> 06:25.200
Look at this guy.

06:53.166 --> 06:55.200
Let's see if you can draw
with hamburger for a hand.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.333
Oh! Oh, God!

07:00.333 --> 07:03.033
Ah!

07:15.233 --> 07:16.766
Jack's about to enter

07:16.833 --> 07:19.900
my drawing room.

07:19.966 --> 07:21.566
Where I'm sure he'll find

07:21.633 --> 07:24.066
plenty of inspiration.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.400
The Phantom.

07:38.266 --> 07:39.766
Relentless.

07:39.833 --> 07:41.233
Powerful.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.033
A merciless avenger.

07:44.066 --> 07:45.500
He lives in the steam tunnels

07:45.566 --> 07:47.533
underneath the campus.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Waiting.

08:46.133 --> 08:48.933
Relentless. Powerful.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.600
Merciless avenger!

08:59.266 --> 09:02.200
Oh, do not fear me, Jack.

09:02.266 --> 09:06.066
I'm your protector, your child.

09:06.133 --> 09:08.066
This isn't happening.

09:08.133 --> 09:10.166
The pen..

09:10.233 --> 09:12.333
...is mightier than the sword.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.733
- What do you want?
- What do&lt;TO2

09:15.800 --> 09:17.733
Me? I-I don't understand.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.233
You will.

09:24.300 --> 09:27.633
Together we will get you
what you want.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.866
Everything you deserve.

09:30.933 --> 09:33.100
Trust me..

09:33.166 --> 09:35.133
...I am your child.

09:42.733 --> 09:44.066
This isn't real!

09:44.133 --> 09:47.133
This is revenge.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.433
Your revenge!

09:51.066 --> 09:54.800
Draw the man who beat you.

09:56.066 --> 09:58.500
Feel where he is..

09:59.733 --> 10:02.633
...and draw him.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.800
Ha ha ha.

10:05.866 --> 10:06.933
Ha ha ha.

10:18.666 --> 10:20.633
'Think of it as a dream.'

10:22.233 --> 10:24.633
Born of your desire.

10:25.466 --> 10:28.866
Set free by your hand.

10:28.933 --> 10:31.433
'Yes.'

10:31.500 --> 10:32.500
'Draw.'

10:34.100 --> 10:35.833
Draw.

10:49.133 --> 10:52.533
Now draw me in..

10:54.233 --> 10:56.233
'...father.'

10:59.733 --> 11:00.800
'Yes.'

11:11.333 --> 11:12.300
'Yes.'

12:07.066 --> 12:08.033
'Hmm.'

12:13.033 --> 12:15.000
I don't remember doing this.

12:15.966 --> 12:17.666
This is great.

12:17.733 --> 12:19.533
Blood sells. They'll eat it up.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.866
We'll call it
"No pain, no gain."

12:21.933 --> 12:23.733
Don't you, don't you think
it's a little over the top

12:23.800 --> 12:26.433
No, no, nothing's sacred
in satire.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.066
I still can't believe
I drew that.

12:28.133 --> 12:29.800
It was all part of some
crazy dream I had.

12:29.866 --> 12:31.200
Just keep it coming,
Jack, my man.

12:31.266 --> 12:33.900
Looks like you do your best work
when you get pushed too far.

12:33.966 --> 12:36.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

12:36.566 --> 12:38.566
I mean maybe you shouldn't
print this, okay, Pete.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.066
Ron might come looking
for me again.

12:40.133 --> 12:42.666
Look, if you back off now
he'll never leave you alone.

12:42.733 --> 12:44.066
You gotta stand up to him.

12:44.133 --> 12:45.433
Show him who gets
the last laugh.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.966
'Guys, check it out.'

12:50.700 --> 12:52.633
Hey, I wonder what's up.

13:02.033 --> 13:03.233
What happened?

13:03.300 --> 13:05.833
Some kinda freak accident.
It's Ron Jordan.

13:05.900 --> 13:07.833
Guess one of the machines
tore him in half.

13:21.700 --> 13:22.700
Joan..

13:23.833 --> 13:25.800
...I-I am so sorry.

13:27.333 --> 13:28.300
Thanks.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.600
They're sending me home.

13:31.666 --> 13:33.800
I don't think I'm feelin' it.

13:33.866 --> 13:35.033
Not yet.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.033
Joan, I didn't know
this would happen.

13:38.533 --> 13:41.100
How could anyone have known?
It's so crazy.

13:41.166 --> 13:44.166
Yesterday he was here
and now he is gone.

13:44.233 --> 13:46.200
Um, look, can I walk you
home or something?

13:49.566 --> 13:52.633
- I'd like that.
- Okay. Okay.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.733
Joan, I didn't mean
for this to happen.

14:01.033 --> 14:03.066
How could you do this?

14:03.133 --> 14:06.733
I knew you didn't like him
but t-this is sick.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.533
You found out how he died
and then you sat and drew this?

14:09.600 --> 14:13.033
Joan, you don't understand.
I drew this first.

14:13.100 --> 14:15.300
What are you talkin' about

14:15.366 --> 14:17.500
Look, just stay away from me,
you twisted little creep.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.533
Joan, wait,
you don't understand.

14:31.866 --> 14:33.400
'No!'

14:36.466 --> 14:38.800
Don't stop.

14:38.866 --> 14:41.100
- Not now.
- Get away from me!

14:42.366 --> 14:45.133
- Father.
- Stop calling me that!

14:46.533 --> 14:49.700
This woman is better off
without him.

14:49.766 --> 14:51.733
You know this.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.533
In your heart, you know.

14:57.866 --> 14:59.400
What are you?

14:59.466 --> 15:03.400
I am for you...for you.

15:03.466 --> 15:05.966
This woman..

15:06.033 --> 15:08.500
This woman too is for you.

15:10.033 --> 15:13.066
She'll never speak to me again.
Not now.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.400
You have talent.

15:21.466 --> 15:23.266
Use it.

15:23.333 --> 15:25.666
Draw what you want..

15:25.733 --> 15:27.800
...what you need.

15:27.866 --> 15:30.266
This..

15:30.333 --> 15:32.600
...is the only way

15:32.666 --> 15:35.033
you will get her back.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.966
But it's not real.

15:37.033 --> 15:38.800
It's not right.

15:38.866 --> 15:42.633
It is your gift. Your only gift.

15:44.266 --> 15:48.066
Others use their gifts
to get what they want.

15:48.133 --> 15:50.900
You have seen this

15:50.966 --> 15:53.200
and they always

15:53.266 --> 15:56.533
leave you behind.

15:57.633 --> 16:00.133
I'm not one of them.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.200
I'm not handsome

16:02.266 --> 16:04.400
and I'm not strong.

16:04.466 --> 16:06.400
But you have power.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.733
Your talent..

16:11.066 --> 16:12.833
...use it.

16:12.900 --> 16:16.533
Draw her...and me.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.533
I will let her see you.

16:23.066 --> 16:25.733
The real you.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.733
And you won't hurt her?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.833
I am under your control.

16:35.266 --> 16:37.300
Draw.

16:39.533 --> 16:40.533
Draw.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.400
Draw.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.233
Someone there?

18:14.766 --> 18:16.100
'No.'

18:17.800 --> 18:19.333
Oh, God.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.500
Oh, God,
please get me out of here.

18:22.566 --> 18:26.266
'I can't take it anymore,
The dark, the space.'

18:26.333 --> 18:29.600
I can't take tight places,
I'm claustrophobic.

18:29.666 --> 18:31.600
Afraid of the dark?

18:33.066 --> 18:35.133
You deserve to be afraid.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.600
I've-I've never hurt anyone.

18:38.666 --> 18:40.600
You've hurt!

18:41.766 --> 18:43.733
You've hurt!

18:46.300 --> 18:48.366
Every time you've neglected

18:48.433 --> 18:52.166
to return a look
that you yourself have inspired.

18:52.233 --> 18:53.700
You've hurt.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.833
You're right.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.833
I don't mean it. I'll stop.

18:57.900 --> 19:01.533
Just let me go. Let me out
of this cage, it's too small.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.133
All of your advantages..

19:07.100 --> 19:09.566
Uh..

19:09.633 --> 19:11.366
...I am going

19:11.433 --> 19:14.500
to take them away..

19:15.566 --> 19:18.866
...one...by one.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.733
Then you'll live life..

19:27.766 --> 19:30.666
'...the way you really are.'

19:31.966 --> 19:34.366
I didn't do anything.

19:34.433 --> 19:36.766
Leave me alone.

19:48.566 --> 19:50.733
- What? What?
- 'Come on, man.'

19:50.800 --> 19:53.333
What? Okay, coming.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.866
O-okay.

19:54.933 --> 19:56.866
Huh!

19:56.933 --> 20:00.033
Jack. Jesus, it's past ten

20:00.100 --> 20:03.166
And I needed
today's cartoons at 9:30.

20:03.233 --> 20:04.833
Okay.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.833
Sorry, I overslept.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.966
No problem.
No problem at all.

20:12.033 --> 20:14.533
Just as long as it produces
more stuff like this.

20:15.766 --> 20:17.366
Really great.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.333
This stuff is kinky.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.133
What?

20:21.200 --> 20:22.900
'Great stuff.'

20:22.966 --> 20:24.766
What's this, new character?

20:24.833 --> 20:28.033
Yeah, we could use this
in our nextexpose.

20:29.066 --> 20:31.566
I don't even remember
drawing this.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.033
Oh, God, Joan, not again.

20:54.333 --> 20:56.466
Sneaking a peek
for your next cartoon?

20:56.533 --> 20:59.066
Uh, n-no, I was, I was jus
looking for Joan.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.166
Have you seen her?

21:00.233 --> 21:03.233
Everyone's looking for Joan,
including me.

21:04.166 --> 21:06.133
I don't know if I see her.

21:27.933 --> 21:29.900
Oh, come on.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.766
Come on.

22:07.766 --> 22:10.933
Jeez. No!

22:15.033 --> 22:18.100
Welcome to your world.

22:18.166 --> 22:20.333
Where is she?
What have you done?

22:21.666 --> 22:23.833
What have you done?

22:23.900 --> 22:26.500
You tricked me.
It's not my fault!

22:29.666 --> 22:31.333
Sniveling coward.

22:38.633 --> 22:41.700
Always blaming someone else.

22:41.766 --> 22:43.966
Never taking the responsibility

22:44.033 --> 22:46.133
of being what you are.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.466
I created you,
and I can erase you..

22:49.533 --> 22:51.433
...just like a bad sketch.

22:51.500 --> 22:55.400
You cannot erase
your mind, father.

22:55.466 --> 22:58.433
And that's where I'm from.

24:02.300 --> 24:03.900
'No, father.'

24:11.466 --> 24:14.933
'Help me.
Help me, I can't breathe.'

24:18.100 --> 24:20.233
'I can't breathe,
it's too tight.'

24:20.300 --> 24:22.600
'It's too small.'

24:22.666 --> 24:24.566
'Help me.'

24:24.633 --> 24:27.233
'Let me out, somebody.
Help me.'

24:29.466 --> 24:32.400
Please...let me out.

24:32.466 --> 24:34.966
I can't take anymore.

24:35.033 --> 24:36.033
Please.

24:41.266 --> 24:43.000
'Jack!'

24:43.066 --> 24:44.733
'Jack!'

24:46.866 --> 24:49.200
Please, Jack, let me go.

24:49.266 --> 24:51.800
No, no, you don't understand.

24:51.866 --> 24:54.200
It wasn't me, it was him.

24:54.266 --> 24:57.733
There is no him, it's you,
can't you see that?

24:57.800 --> 25:00.366
- Jack! Jack!
- No, no, no!

25:00.433 --> 25:04.000
- No.
- 'Jack...Jack, where are you?'

25:05.433 --> 25:07.733
Pete, Pete, look down here

25:07.800 --> 25:09.400
it's me, Jack.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.866
Down here. Pete, get me out.

25:11.933 --> 25:15.100
Help, Pete, help!

25:15.166 --> 25:18.966
- Pete, get me out.
- Dammit, Jack, why'd you do it?

25:19.033 --> 25:21.800
Looks like you needed more help
than I thought.

25:21.866 --> 25:24.300
'Help me out, please.'

25:24.366 --> 25:26.033
'Please, Pete.'

25:26.933 --> 25:29.900
'He-e-elp!'

25:34.833 --> 25:36.833
Jack wanted the good life.

25:36.900 --> 25:39.433
But he painted himself
into a corner

25:39.500 --> 25:43.033
when he met one of my buddies.

26:04.300 --> 26:06.100
Okay, kiddo.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.100
Sixty four thousand
dollar question.

26:10.433 --> 26:13.033
Still having nightmares
about being buried alive?

26:13.100 --> 26:14.633
No.

26:14.700 --> 26:18.266
No, that all ended weeks ago.

26:18.333 --> 26:19.433
Good answer.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.233
I gotta tell you,
if you'd said anything different

26:21.300 --> 26:23.133
we might have to keep you
locked up a few days.

26:23.200 --> 26:27.033
I'm just anxious to get back to
a normal life.

26:27.100 --> 26:29.033
I know, I know.

26:29.100 --> 26:31.833
But you gotta take it slow

26:31.900 --> 26:34.533
For cryin' out loud, you were
kidnapped and imprisoned.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.066
It's nothing to take lightly.

26:36.133 --> 26:38.100
We're talking
substantial trauma here.

26:39.466 --> 26:40.700
I'm coming out of it now.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.733
Right, coming out of it,
but you can still expect

26:42.800 --> 26:46.066
to feel traces of paranoia
claustrophobia

26:46.133 --> 26:47.533
'fear of entrapment.'

26:47.600 --> 26:49.500
I'll be fine.

26:49.566 --> 26:52.200
Well, why don't we go over
few warning signs

26:52.266 --> 26:54.133
just in case?

26:54.200 --> 26:56.133
I don't think
I wanna hear this.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.933
Humor me, okay?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.966
Really, Joanie,
if you experience

27:01.033 --> 27:02.966
anything like this,
I want you to get in touch

27:03.033 --> 27:05.500
with me immediately.

27:05.566 --> 27:07.000
Paranoia

27:07.066 --> 27:09.766
hallucinations, migraines

27:09.833 --> 27:13.133
even something as simple
as a lingering sense of dread.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.666
You've just described
the normal life

27:14.733 --> 27:17.133
of every citizen in Springwood.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.000
No, come on, straighten it
Straight time now, kiddo.

27:20.066 --> 27:22.133
I'm not joking.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.600
I know. I'll call.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.966
Okay, you're sprung.

27:28.033 --> 27:30.233
Here's your prescription.

27:31.833 --> 27:32.966
Take one when you get home

27:33.033 --> 27:35.466
and I want you to go
straight home and stay there

27:35.533 --> 27:36.500
the whole weekend.

27:36.566 --> 27:40.166
Order out for pizza.
Take it easy, relax.

27:40.233 --> 27:42.200
- I plan to.
- Alright, get outta here.

27:49.933 --> 27:53.833
Hey...I'm okay.

27:53.900 --> 27:55.800
You're okay.

27:55.866 --> 27:58.433
But our Joanie? Hmm..

27:58.500 --> 28:02.200
She's skatin' on real thin ice.

28:03.833 --> 28:07.200
Think I'll, uh, stick her
in a couple of tight places.

28:21.766 --> 28:22.733
Sherry?

28:25.400 --> 28:26.666
Welcome home!

28:26.733 --> 28:28.700
Surprise!

28:29.633 --> 28:31.100
Did I get you, huh?

28:31.166 --> 28:32.800
Yeah, you got me.

28:32.866 --> 28:33.933
Oh. Come on.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.566
'That's great, how you doing?'

28:43.166 --> 28:45.866
It's really good
to have you back home.

28:45.933 --> 28:47.900
It's good not to be
in the hospital.

28:48.933 --> 28:51.033
You are a one tough babe.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.566
To get kidnapped by some psycho

28:52.633 --> 28:55.866
and then have to spend
all that time in hospital.

28:55.933 --> 28:58.833
It wasn't that bad.
The hospital, I mean.

29:00.666 --> 29:02.700
Did they cure
your claustrophobia?

29:03.900 --> 29:05.000
There's no cure for it.

29:05.066 --> 29:07.400
They just help you
to try to deal with it.

29:07.466 --> 29:09.433
And speakin'
of dealing with it..

29:24.000 --> 29:26.833
But they let you come home, so
that must mean that you're okay.

29:28.233 --> 29:30.633
Okay enough to get back
to the real world.

29:30.700 --> 29:33.566
Are you okay enough
to come with me and Brad?

29:33.633 --> 29:35.366
I'm too clumsy to ski,
besides you guys

29:35.433 --> 29:37.233
don't want me
crowding the cabin.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.433
Maybe I should stay
home with you.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.500
You do and I'll never
speak to you again.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.600
Alright.

29:46.833 --> 29:49.133
Well, if I'm gonna go,
then I better go get some sleep.

29:50.566 --> 29:52.100
Don't stay up too late.

29:52.166 --> 29:54.433
I won't.
These pills make me drowsy

30:17.066 --> 30:19.600
It was really great last month
and you missed it.

30:21.700 --> 30:23.733
You sure you don't
wanna come with us?

30:23.800 --> 30:26.266
No, I just wanna hang out.

30:26.333 --> 30:27.533
This is the first time
in a long time

30:27.600 --> 30:29.433
I don't have any doctors
swarming over me.

30:29.500 --> 30:31.566
Oh, Ihatedoctors.

30:31.633 --> 30:33.800
They always make me
feel like a dartboard.

30:36.233 --> 30:38.500
Damn, this door always sticks!

30:40.633 --> 30:42.833
Oh-h, it's probably my mom.

30:42.900 --> 30:45.433
Um, look, can you get my skis?
They're in the back someplace.

30:52.766 --> 30:54.733
It's only a closet.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.200
Hey, Joanie, what's up?
This is my cousin, Jamie.

31:49.266 --> 31:51.200
He's gonna give us a lift
to the train station.

31:51.266 --> 31:53.533
- Hi.
- I'm gonna go get my girl.

31:55.166 --> 31:58.133
So, um, you're not going
on the big ski trip, huh?

31:58.200 --> 32:00.333
No, not for me.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.766
Me, either.
I can't even skateboard.

32:07.533 --> 32:08.933
So, anyway, um..

32:09.000 --> 32:10.166
...you know
I'll be dropping these guys off

32:10.233 --> 32:12.300
in about a,
about an hour or so..

32:12.366 --> 32:14.666
...maybe you'd like to go out
to dinner with me later.

32:14.733 --> 32:17.400
No, thanks. I have too much
to do here around the house.

32:18.333 --> 32:19.466
- Thanks anyway.
- Yeah, sure.

32:19.533 --> 32:20.933
Okay, bye, babe,
you have our phone number

32:21.000 --> 32:22.066
if you need us, right?

32:22.133 --> 32:23.266
- Right.
- You gonna be okay?

32:23.333 --> 32:25.900
- Sure. Okay, have a good time.
- Okay.

32:25.966 --> 32:27.133
Bye-bye.

32:29.233 --> 32:30.800
- Take it easy, Joanie.
- Bye.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.333
- Do you wanna get that?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.400
Thanks.

32:34.233 --> 32:35.233
Bye.

32:58.166 --> 32:59.133
God!

33:04.533 --> 33:06.733
You're okay. You're okay.

33:07.900 --> 33:09.366
One, two, three,
four, five, six..

33:09.433 --> 33:12.100
A, B, C, D, E, F, G..

33:12.166 --> 33:14.100
One, two, three.

34:12.066 --> 34:13.533
- 'Hello.'
- Oh, doctor!

34:13.600 --> 34:15.066
Thank God! I wanted..

34:15.133 --> 34:17.466
'You've reached the home
of Dr. and Mrs. Martel.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.400
'Please, leave a message
at the beep.'

34:20.633 --> 34:22.600
Dr. Martel, it's Joan.

34:23.733 --> 34:26.233
I'm s-sort of
having a little trouble.

34:26.300 --> 34:28.833
I'm-I'm having an episode.

34:29.966 --> 34:32.000
Please, call me when you can.

34:33.966 --> 34:35.933
I'll be home.

35:08.133 --> 35:09.666
- Who is it?
- 'Uh, it's okay, Joan.'

35:09.733 --> 35:11.900
'It's me, Jamie. From before?'

35:14.366 --> 35:15.900
- What do you want?
- Um, well..

35:15.966 --> 35:18.900
Sherry was gonna lend me
one of her textbooks and, um..

35:18.966 --> 35:21.500
You know, I forgot to get it
when we were here before.

35:21.566 --> 35:23.533
So, she said that I could
come back for it.

35:24.833 --> 35:27.300
So, do you think I could
get it now? I'll be quick.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.233
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

35:42.633 --> 35:44.233
Look, I really don't have
time for jokes.

35:44.300 --> 35:45.800
Just find the book and leave.

35:45.866 --> 35:47.666
Oh, yeah. Sure.

35:47.733 --> 35:50.166
Sure. I'm not gonna stay long.

35:50.233 --> 35:52.266
Just gonna what,
use the bathroom

35:52.333 --> 35:54.533
maybe make a few phone calls.

35:59.966 --> 36:02.033
So, um..

36:02.100 --> 36:04.733
...did he keep you
in something like this?

36:04.800 --> 36:07.433
- Excuse me?
- The guy!

36:07.500 --> 36:10.900
You know...the guy
who kidnapped you.

36:11.933 --> 36:13.966
I mean, um..

36:14.033 --> 36:16.300
...did he stick you
in the closet?

36:16.366 --> 36:18.466
Or was it worse?

36:18.533 --> 36:19.966
Who told you?

36:20.033 --> 36:21.033
Sherry.

36:21.966 --> 36:24.233
She thinks it's a real riot.

36:27.266 --> 36:28.866
Anyway, um..

36:28.933 --> 36:31.666
...this guy, I mean, this guy..

36:31.733 --> 36:35.000
...did he, like, uh,
let you go to the bathroom?

36:35.066 --> 36:37.333
Get out! Now!

36:37.400 --> 36:39.333
Come on.

36:40.300 --> 36:42.333
I mean..

36:42.400 --> 36:45.066
...we're just getting
to know each other.

36:45.133 --> 36:47.666
I don't like to talk about it.

36:47.733 --> 36:49.700
No problem.

36:51.066 --> 36:53.033
You don't have to talk.

36:55.866 --> 36:58.266
You can show me.

36:58.333 --> 36:59.333
What?

37:00.466 --> 37:02.766
So this guy, I mean, um..

37:02.833 --> 37:05.600
...did he, like, uh,
do things to ya?

37:08.500 --> 37:09.900
Where is it?

37:09.966 --> 37:12.533
- Where is what?
- The bathroom! The bathroom!

37:13.700 --> 37:15.933
I, um, I said..

37:16.000 --> 37:18.600
...that I had to go
to the bathroom.

37:21.166 --> 37:23.100
It's down the hall.

37:24.833 --> 37:26.800
I'll be quick.

37:37.233 --> 37:38.633
Hey!

37:38.700 --> 37:41.266
Hey, who were you calling?

37:41.333 --> 37:43.800
- My, um, doctor.
- Y-your doctor?

37:43.866 --> 37:45.100
I've been trying to reach him.

37:45.166 --> 37:46.433
Why, what's the matter?
You're sick or something?

37:46.500 --> 37:48.333
I think I must be!

37:48.400 --> 37:50.700
Please, I think
it's time you left!

37:50.800 --> 37:51.800
Hey.

37:53.233 --> 37:55.133
Are you throwing me out?

37:55.200 --> 37:58.000
Do you really think
you can throw

37:59.500 --> 38:02.133
Why are you doing this?

38:09.566 --> 38:11.600
I just..

38:11.666 --> 38:14.333
I just wanna hear the story.

38:16.466 --> 38:18.500
The story.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.900
So I mean, uh..

38:23.866 --> 38:25.233
...what did this guy do to ya?

38:28.366 --> 38:30.033
It doesn't matter, really

38:30.100 --> 38:32.233
because, um..

38:32.300 --> 38:33.866
...it's nothing

38:33.933 --> 38:37.033
compared to what
I'm gonna do to ya.

38:37.100 --> 38:38.166
Come here.

38:39.433 --> 38:42.033
Come on! You cook?

38:42.100 --> 38:44.333
- Please!
- Make me something to eat.

38:45.566 --> 38:47.700
And don't make me
none of this crap, either.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.933
I want something..

38:53.600 --> 38:55.866
...that's gonna
roll off my tongue.

38:58.500 --> 38:59.733
Move!

39:16.300 --> 39:19.600
You...you little tease.

39:22.533 --> 39:25.066
It's time to take
a trip to the closet.

39:44.100 --> 39:45.300
Okay.

40:13.133 --> 40:14.700
Hi. How you doing?

40:16.366 --> 40:19.800
'Uh, uh, hi, Joan.
Gee, I'm sorry to bug you.'

40:19.866 --> 40:22.166
- 'I, uh, I forgot to pick up--'
- A book, right?

40:22.233 --> 40:24.200
'Well, yeah. How did you know?'

40:36.300 --> 40:37.400
Joan?

40:40.466 --> 40:43.000
Um, are you, like, okay?

40:43.866 --> 40:45.300
Why? Don't I look okay?

40:45.366 --> 40:46.800
Uh, oh, yeah, sure.

40:46.866 --> 40:48.600
Uh, sure, you do.
I-I didn't mean anything by it.

40:48.666 --> 40:50.333
It's just that, um..

40:50.400 --> 40:52.033
Well, Sherry, she..

40:52.100 --> 40:54.466
'She mentioned your experience.'

40:54.533 --> 40:56.333
I'm fine, really.

40:56.400 --> 40:58.100
I'm just having
a little trouble adjusting.

40:58.166 --> 40:59.966
'My imagination is running
away with me.'

41:00.033 --> 41:01.733
'I'll settle down.'

41:02.833 --> 41:04.400
W-would you excuse me a second?

41:04.466 --> 41:06.433
I have to go check on something.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.933
Oh, sure.

41:31.166 --> 41:32.233
'Hello, can I help you?'

41:32.300 --> 41:33.766
This isn't a machine?

41:33.833 --> 41:35.866
'Uh, this is Dr. Martel's
answering service.'

41:35.933 --> 41:38.666
- 'Uh, may I help you?'
- I need to reach the doctor!

41:38.733 --> 41:40.900
'Well, it's the answering
service. Can I help you?'

41:40.966 --> 41:43.533
I don't need his answering
service! I need him!

41:43.600 --> 41:46.000
'You're gonna need a lot more
than that, babe.'

41:51.666 --> 41:54.366
I'm losing all touch
with reality.

41:54.433 --> 41:55.633
'Hello?'

41:55.700 --> 41:57.366
'Is that the message
you'd like to leave, miss?'

42:46.033 --> 42:47.633
- Who's there?
- 'It's Jamie.'

42:47.700 --> 42:50.333
'Sorry to bother you,
but I left a book here.'

42:51.433 --> 42:52.833
I'm not home now.

42:52.900 --> 42:55.300
'Come on, open up.'

42:55.366 --> 42:56.500
Leave me alone!

42:56.566 --> 42:58.600
'No, can't do, Joannie.'

43:01.033 --> 43:02.100
Joan?

43:19.200 --> 43:21.400
You deservespecialtr

43:22.766 --> 43:24.100
Right this way.

43:24.166 --> 43:26.100
Always room for one more.

43:30.900 --> 43:32.966
'No!'

43:39.066 --> 43:40.033
Joan?

43:41.566 --> 43:42.600
Joannie?

43:44.233 --> 43:45.566
Where is she?

43:45.633 --> 43:47.600
I'm gonna get the other bags.

43:54.400 --> 43:56.333
God, it's really stuck
this time.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.366
'Oh, my God.'

44:22.433 --> 44:24.866
Let me out! Let me out!

44:24.933 --> 44:27.466
Please! Let me out!

44:27.533 --> 44:28.900
'Let me go!'

44:28.966 --> 44:30.933
Oh, my God.

44:41.366 --> 44:42.766
I want you to go home.

44:42.833 --> 44:45.200
Straight home and stay there,
the whole weekend.

44:45.266 --> 44:48.300
Order out for pizza.
Relax, take it easy.

44:48.366 --> 44:50.333
I'll be fine.

44:56.233 --> 44:59.533
What's so bad about
being buried alive?

45:00.900 --> 45:02.300
Beats being barbequed.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.333
Hold my calls.
