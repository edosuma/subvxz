24:28.466 --> 24:31.386
Raqueletta Moss is present and on time.

24:31.469 --> 24:35.182
But Ms. Nola Darling is 16 minutes late.

24:35.265 --> 24:38.101
What? I thought class started at 9:15.

24:38.185 --> 24:41.271
Is that what you thought?
How artistic of you.

24:41.354 --> 24:45.358
We start at 9:00 a.m. sharp,
and it is now 9:16-- nope, 17.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.569
[chuckles] She's mad late, y'all!

24:47.652 --> 24:49.446
-[students laughing]
-All right.

24:50.447 --> 24:56.203
But, because studies show that any sort
of arts exposure is very good

24:56.286 --> 25:00.540
at increasing attendance, morale,
and test scores in all subjects,

25:00.624 --> 25:02.959
and because our motto is...

25:03.043 --> 25:07.297
[together]
"With love, compassion, and discipline,

25:07.380 --> 25:10.342
we expect success."

25:10.800 --> 25:14.012
Raqueletta Moss is going to reach
into her pocket of generosity

25:14.095 --> 25:16.097
and let Nola Darling teach
with the knowledge

25:16.181 --> 25:19.726
that this tardy behavior
will never happen again.

25:20.644 --> 25:22.729
You have your lesson plan? Begin.

25:23.521 --> 25:25.523
Raqueletta Moss out.

25:31.696 --> 25:32.697
[door closes]

25:33.448 --> 25:35.408
Who needs a lesson plan, right?

25:35.492 --> 25:36.868
Let's just flow today.

25:37.535 --> 25:40.538
How many of you
have ever been late before?

25:42.207 --> 25:43.124
Nobody.

25:44.167 --> 25:48.338
Okay, how about any friends, siblings?

25:51.549 --> 25:53.718
No one makes mistakes here. Got it.

25:53.802 --> 25:58.765
In that case, what would a world
without mistakes look like?

25:58.848 --> 26:02.394
What shapes and colors would it have?
Who wants to show me?

26:04.354 --> 26:05.355
What's your name?

26:05.438 --> 26:08.108
Regina Walters,
but people call me "Reggie."

26:08.191 --> 26:10.485
Nice to meet you, Reggie. Come on up here.

26:12.487 --> 26:15.657
-You want me to draw on the chalkboard?
-No. Draw on me.

26:18.868 --> 26:22.706
-Can I draw on your hair?
-[laughter]

26:22.789 --> 26:25.667
And then we made
these found object sculptures

26:25.750 --> 26:27.794
from whatever we could scavenge
in the classroom.

26:27.877 --> 26:28.962
It was awesome.

26:29.045 --> 26:31.089
I'm impressed you made it
through your first day

26:31.172 --> 26:33.008
after your late start and the key debacle,

26:33.091 --> 26:35.719
but you really should have rung
the doorbell last night.

26:35.802 --> 26:37.512
I'm just tryin' to grow up, Mom.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.848
Well, put this around your neck
or somethin'.

26:42.726 --> 26:43.727
Hey, Miss Ella.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.230
You lost your keys again?

26:47.772 --> 26:49.983
I'm so sorry
for calling so late last night.

26:50.734 --> 26:51.985
Sit on my stoop, girl.

26:57.824 --> 27:00.035
I got my spare set from my moms, though.

27:00.118 --> 27:03.580
That's good, 'cause I wasn't gonna
replace them for the third time.

27:03.663 --> 27:06.791
And where's your rent, pray tell?
It's two and a half weeks late.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.418
My student loan deferment ended,

27:08.501 --> 27:10.795
so I'm bringing in less money
every month now.

27:10.879 --> 27:14.090
I said "rent," not "deferment." Rent.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.134
I'm already cutting you a deal

27:16.217 --> 27:19.888
because Septima and Stokes and I
go way back.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.681
I know. I'm working on it.

27:21.765 --> 27:25.810
I could be getting three times from
these white folks what I'm chargin' you.

27:26.603 --> 27:27.979
What your parents' gettin'?

27:28.438 --> 27:29.939
I never asked them.

27:30.023 --> 27:32.150
Just don't make me have to harangue you.

27:32.692 --> 27:34.110
It messes up my yoga.

27:34.194 --> 27:37.906
I'll pay you as soon as I get my check
from teaching, I promise you.

27:41.993 --> 27:45.497
I try not to make promises I can't keep.

27:49.292 --> 27:54.756
Miss Ella, I promise... I promise
I will get you your rent on time.

27:55.215 --> 27:56.925
I'll get you your money.
