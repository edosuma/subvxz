WEBVTT

00:06.675 --> 00:08.711
Last time on Superstition...

00:08.748 --> 00:10.093
Welcome home, son.

00:10.130 --> 00:11.900
Would it have killed you to
let me know I had a daughter?

00:11.943 --> 00:14.733
My father would have
stayed around to raise me.

00:14.767 --> 00:16.905
Can you do a deep dive on the dark web

00:16.912 --> 00:18.705
for anything on Calvin Hastings?

00:18.735 --> 00:20.862
Looks like you're gonna be
the man of the house soon.

00:20.885 --> 00:23.011
I want you to take this. You wear it.

00:23.136 --> 00:24.933
And don't ever take it off.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.592 --> 00:38.028
Good morning.

00:39.493 --> 00:40.850
Can I help you?

00:41.748 --> 00:43.182
Um, water...

00:43.444 --> 00:45.200
for now. We're waiting
on the rest of our party.

00:45.217 --> 00:46.277
Thank you.

00:46.342 --> 00:47.532
Very good.

01:01.385 --> 01:03.058
Whiskey. Neat.

01:07.129 --> 01:09.684
I'm a little lonely,
so keep the bottle here.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.151
Yeah.

01:24.390 --> 01:25.578
Here you go.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.430
Friend of yours?

01:33.455 --> 01:36.110
More like extended family.

01:40.429 --> 01:41.600
Really?

01:44.324 --> 01:45.565
Okay.

01:55.433 --> 01:57.401
Wasn't that long ago when your kind

01:57.416 --> 02:00.441
weren't allowed to masquerade
in public like this.

02:00.932 --> 02:02.648
Simpler times.

02:03.049 --> 02:04.649
What do you want, James?

02:04.774 --> 02:06.400
You know exactly what I want.

02:07.600 --> 02:11.147
You can hear the master's
call just as well as we can.

02:11.358 --> 02:14.241
So whatever it is you
think you're gonna do to us

02:14.366 --> 02:15.920
more are coming.

02:17.867 --> 02:18.934
I'm counting on it.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.373
Put your hands where I can see 'em!

02:59.433 --> 03:01.818
Or I call the cops. Now!

03:01.839 --> 03:03.227
I'll wait.

03:06.115 --> 03:07.883
You know instead of raising my hands,

03:07.920 --> 03:09.551
I'm gonna raise my glass.

03:11.933 --> 03:14.193
I wouldn't pull the
trigger if I were you.

03:14.525 --> 03:17.704
That dagger's wedged in there
tighter than a nun's chuff.

03:18.267 --> 03:19.633
It might backfire.

03:20.127 --> 03:21.420
As for them,

03:22.033 --> 03:23.427
you can thank me later.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.691
More are coming.

03:26.488 --> 03:27.650
Salut!

03:46.220 --> 03:47.503
What are you doing?

03:51.436 --> 03:52.867
I can't... I can't even hear you.

03:52.883 --> 03:55.242
Turn the party down.
Come to breakfast with me.

03:55.702 --> 03:56.764
I'll make your favorite.

03:56.790 --> 03:58.896
Scrambled... I haven't
had that in years.

03:58.900 --> 04:01.008
No, I literally have to
run the Boston Marathon

04:01.050 --> 04:02.375
to burn off those calories.

04:02.607 --> 04:05.067
- All right. Call in a cheat day.
- Rain check.

04:05.128 --> 04:06.590
- I'm already running.
- Run, dance.

04:06.601 --> 04:07.728
Run, dance. It's your choice.

04:07.755 --> 04:09.033
Running. I'm running late.

04:09.114 --> 04:10.161
Aren't you the chief?

04:10.667 --> 04:12.131
Doesn't it come with
some kind of privileges?

04:12.184 --> 04:14.796
Yes. And responsibility.
Order doesn't keep itself.

04:14.875 --> 04:16.447
What do you want, Calvin?

04:17.300 --> 04:18.933
Nothing, it's just, uh...

04:20.666 --> 04:22.393
I haven't seen you since I've been back.

04:22.446 --> 04:24.326
And then there's... You know?

04:24.367 --> 04:25.941
And the Garvey, of it all, right?

04:25.967 --> 04:27.916
Yeah. I'm pretty sure she hates me.

04:28.670 --> 04:31.500
She... She doesn't hate you. It's, um...

04:33.100 --> 04:34.193
It's complicated.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.913
Yeah, I still know
when you're lying to me.

04:35.967 --> 04:37.191
Okay, well, hold on.

04:37.316 --> 04:40.058
I just need a few pointers on

04:40.317 --> 04:42.840
how to make up for 16
years as an absentee father?

04:44.857 --> 04:46.799
Luigi's, 1900 sharp, Marine.

04:46.924 --> 04:48.567
- Luigi's?
- Don't be late.

04:49.588 --> 04:50.744
Yeah.

04:52.819 --> 04:53.906
I'll be there.

04:54.139 --> 04:55.147
Oorah.

04:55.332 --> 04:56.351
Bye.

04:56.398 --> 04:57.539
Oorah.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.420
What? Come on, come on, come on.
Knees, knees. High ups, let's go.

05:03.733 --> 05:05.068
You're going on a date with him.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.398
It's not a date.

05:06.863 --> 05:08.077
It's just...

05:08.990 --> 05:11.549
I don't know, just two people
with a little something in common

05:11.581 --> 05:12.874
meeting over dinner.

05:13.439 --> 05:14.939
I'm not a little something.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.208
- And that's a date.
- He knew what I meant.

05:17.236 --> 05:19.339
- And no, it's not.
- Hook up. Whatever you want to call it.

05:19.372 --> 05:21.253
- Definitely not a hook up.
- Right.

05:21.570 --> 05:22.877
That's stranger danger.

05:22.900 --> 05:23.915
Garvey.

05:24.701 --> 05:26.285
Calvin is no stranger.

05:26.306 --> 05:28.191
He is your father whether
you like it or not.

05:28.566 --> 05:29.827
I want you to get to know him.

05:29.952 --> 05:31.511
- Oh, I know him.
- Oh, really?

05:31.538 --> 05:32.678
Yeah.

05:32.803 --> 05:34.669
You know I did a
background check on him.

05:34.794 --> 05:37.524
Past three years of his
military service are classified.

05:39.176 --> 05:41.943
Government secrecy isn't out
of the ordinary for a Marine.

05:41.964 --> 05:43.131
- True.
- True.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.310
- But that depends what the secrets are.
- Garvey.

05:47.728 --> 05:49.069
Your father is a good man.

05:49.528 --> 05:51.122
Please just give him
a chance to prove it.

05:51.201 --> 05:52.521
Right.

05:53.170 --> 05:55.442
- Do good people hide things from their families?
- Garvey.

05:55.461 --> 05:56.802
I'm just saying.

05:56.876 --> 05:58.149
See now, that...

05:58.207 --> 06:00.223
could make for an interesting
conversation on your date.

06:00.245 --> 06:01.632
Not a date.

06:01.667 --> 06:02.889
- Yeah.
- Not a date.

06:02.933 --> 06:04.375
- I gotta go, Mom.
- I love you.

06:04.389 --> 06:05.667
Love you, too.

06:06.701 --> 06:08.174
Chief Westbrook.

06:10.645 --> 06:11.695
I'm on the way.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.176
Uh-huh.

06:14.533 --> 06:16.977
- You found a notch?
- The mark of Asmodeus.

06:17.102 --> 06:19.508
The inferno that helped
build King Solomon's tomb

06:19.517 --> 06:21.299
before usurping the king

06:21.339 --> 06:23.979
and ruling in Solomon's form.

06:24.032 --> 06:25.300
Wait.

06:25.352 --> 06:28.084
The king of demons, that's
who invaded our home?

06:28.100 --> 06:29.200
Mm-hmm.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.876
Okay, how was he even defeated?

06:30.895 --> 06:32.427
The ring of Solomon.

06:32.633 --> 06:34.533
The ring Isaac gave
Calvin before he left.

06:34.571 --> 06:36.419
You know, this is true, it explains why

06:36.445 --> 06:38.642
the Dredge is the most powerful
inferno we've ever had to face.

06:38.676 --> 06:40.279
I wish Isaac was here.

06:40.306 --> 06:42.042
This magic is older than him.

06:42.642 --> 06:44.167
Wonderful.

06:44.542 --> 06:45.604
Okay, look,

06:45.670 --> 06:47.405
Isaac left to lure away the Dredge

06:47.451 --> 06:49.893
so we could buy time to learn as much
as we could about his true nature.

06:49.933 --> 06:51.760
Less talk, more research.

06:55.033 --> 06:56.967
Okay, no, Bea. I have to ask.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.567
What about the true nature of Isaac?

06:59.667 --> 07:02.999
I'm sorry, but immortality is a
hell of a secret to be sitting on.

07:03.012 --> 07:04.567
What is he not telling us?

07:04.589 --> 07:07.011
What is he not telling you?

07:07.733 --> 07:09.777
Isaac doesn't keep secrets from me.

07:10.067 --> 07:12.806
Last time I checked, he was a man.

07:13.167 --> 07:16.000
But seriously, I mean, how
would you even know for sure?

07:16.020 --> 07:19.022
Mm. Superstition passed
down to me from my mother.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.094
"Cut off the tongue

07:21.114 --> 07:24.624
of a live goose and lay it on
the chest of a sleeping man.

07:24.933 --> 07:27.231
When he wakes, he'll
tell you all he knows."

07:27.633 --> 07:30.458
Well, that explains
our Christmas dinners.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.100
Why would this drunk randomly
kill a couple at the Cottonmouth?

07:39.155 --> 07:41.767
Travis witnessed the
altercation, signed an affidavit.

07:41.782 --> 07:44.408
He had a crap load of weird
weapons on him. And a cool flask.

07:44.421 --> 07:45.939
I think it was an antique.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.114
I locked it all up in the evidence room.

07:50.633 --> 07:52.467
And Norman Bates, he hasn't said a word.

07:52.678 --> 07:55.086
I was kind of waiting on you
to interrogate him, Chief.

07:55.211 --> 07:56.511
He gives me the willies.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.039
Really, Deputy?

08:01.773 --> 08:03.827
You could always just try
looking into his good eye.

08:17.236 --> 08:19.232
Can I get you some water, some coffee?

08:19.992 --> 08:22.347
Whiskey will do mighty fine.

08:22.374 --> 08:24.724
Oh, yeah. I'll get right on that.

08:26.117 --> 08:27.986
You care to tell me what
happened this morning?

08:28.165 --> 08:30.076
You can't hear, can you?

08:30.245 --> 08:32.642
Hear what, hmm? Voices?

08:32.869 --> 08:34.749
Did the voices tell you
to murder that couple?

08:35.831 --> 08:37.135
More are coming.

08:37.260 --> 08:38.418
Who is coming?

08:41.765 --> 08:43.422
Hey, you can answer my questions now

08:43.433 --> 08:45.661
or you can sleep it off
here and answer them later.

08:45.867 --> 08:47.167
The ball is in your court.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.544
- More are coming.
- Yeah. We've been over that.

08:54.667 --> 08:55.972
Fine.

08:56.032 --> 08:58.011
So, you're going to
need a public defender,

08:58.031 --> 08:59.919
a change of clothes and
from the smell of things,

08:59.938 --> 09:02.037
a good hosing down.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.188
So you just sit tight,
I'll be back in two shakes.

09:04.459 --> 09:06.133
Calvin Hastings.

09:11.405 --> 09:14.630
- How do you know him?
- I'll only speak to Calvin Hastings.

09:16.767 --> 09:18.700
More are coming.

09:31.006 --> 09:33.267
You have had a busy day.

09:34.826 --> 09:36.632
How do you know my name?

09:37.233 --> 09:39.404
I'm pretty sure I'd
remember a face like yours.

09:39.437 --> 09:41.433
Calvin, son of Isaac.

09:41.558 --> 09:44.411
Thought you'd be taller.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.807
I thought you'd be clean and sober.

09:47.932 --> 09:49.906
We can't all be winners, can we?

09:51.167 --> 09:53.100
Drink, there was a noise.

09:54.387 --> 09:57.146
You can't hear the
herald's call, can you?

10:07.586 --> 10:10.267
The only thing I hear is the
sound of my time you're wasting.

10:11.167 --> 10:12.800
How do you know my father?

10:12.900 --> 10:14.707
Release me and I'll tell you.

10:15.710 --> 10:17.067
And why would I do that?

10:17.167 --> 10:19.033
Because more are coming.

10:19.800 --> 10:23.512
- What does that mean, "more?"
- More are coming.

10:30.996 --> 10:33.701
An immortal sworn by holy pledge

10:33.826 --> 10:36.605
must live his life on razor's edge.

10:37.267 --> 10:41.330
Before this templars of
war which began as a moon

10:42.233 --> 10:45.667
but will as surely end with the Dredge.

10:51.533 --> 10:54.213
You wacked two people.

10:54.667 --> 10:57.110
If you're looking for
help, you're gonna have to

10:58.126 --> 10:59.767
help yourself.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.388
The hell was that?

11:11.033 --> 11:12.900
The technical term is a "nutburger."

11:13.000 --> 11:14.803
Was that rhyming nonsense about Isaac?

11:14.816 --> 11:17.000
Still waiting on that whiskey.

11:17.100 --> 11:18.499
The ramblings of a drunk.

11:18.776 --> 11:21.191
You know most of this town
thinks that Hastings is just a

11:21.211 --> 11:23.006
Southern reboot of the Addams Family.

11:23.033 --> 11:25.071
Just a cook looking for attention.

11:25.639 --> 11:28.232
The state of Georgia tends
to frown on double homicide,

11:28.267 --> 11:30.047
so his fate is sealed.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.733
Then I guess we're done here.

11:34.367 --> 11:36.333
There's something you're not telling me.

11:37.067 --> 11:38.706
Why did he ask for you?

11:41.121 --> 11:42.333
No idea.

12:04.044 --> 12:06.071
It's okay. It's okay.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.567
- Oops!
- Excuse me, sorry about that.

12:08.615 --> 12:10.188
No, it's quite all right, we're...

12:10.231 --> 12:12.110
too busy looking for a
place to eat around here.

12:12.126 --> 12:14.180
- Oh, new in town?
- Guilty as charged.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.891
Oh, the Cottonmouth's your best bet.

12:15.923 --> 12:17.903
The gator bites are
to die for, trust me.

12:18.109 --> 12:20.743
What a lovely spawn you have there.

12:20.801 --> 12:22.354
Pay no mind, he's teething.

12:22.370 --> 12:25.036
Oh, not yet ripe.

12:25.464 --> 12:26.800
Pity.

12:28.167 --> 12:29.467
Come on, baby.

12:33.700 --> 12:34.867
Patience.

12:35.236 --> 12:38.100
There'll be plenty to feast upon
after our brethren have gathered.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.756
But I hunger now.

12:39.988 --> 12:43.858
Our master has called to sit
and wait for his instructions.

12:43.867 --> 12:45.000
And then?

12:45.125 --> 12:47.533
And then we'll take the
abuse of this planet,

12:47.658 --> 12:49.564
and bring it back to its source.

12:49.689 --> 12:53.660
All of our show will be
cleansed and rectified.

12:53.785 --> 12:57.377
He spun his head clean around, Calvin.

12:59.214 --> 13:01.068
I ain't ever seen anything like it.

13:01.562 --> 13:03.151
Not even in Nam.

13:03.653 --> 13:05.337
Anything else you recall?

13:07.195 --> 13:09.967
The couple said he was extended family.

13:10.157 --> 13:13.774
Said somethin' about a master's call.

13:15.967 --> 13:17.474
So what was it, huh?

13:17.870 --> 13:19.555
His Axe body spray?

13:20.119 --> 13:22.548
Why was I stood up in
Luigi's for a nut burger

13:22.564 --> 13:25.042
who you yourself claimed you didn't
want anything to do with, huh?

13:25.071 --> 13:26.533
When did the romance begin?

13:27.246 --> 13:29.242
Not so much of romance, it's more like

13:29.267 --> 13:31.419
-  just male companionship.
- Calvin Hastings...

13:31.618 --> 13:32.731
Chief.

13:32.856 --> 13:35.244
Calvin... Uh, I'll leave the two of you.

13:36.941 --> 13:39.533
Wow.

13:42.633 --> 13:45.333
I am really sorry, I left you hangin'.

13:45.433 --> 13:48.308
That was really raggity of me.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.099
I just, I got caught up.

13:50.535 --> 13:52.784
Not as caught up as I am with
you in this dress right now.

13:52.814 --> 13:54.222
It's very nice, by the way.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.750
Caught up with what, Calvin?

13:57.383 --> 14:00.184
Due diligence, crossing my T's and
dotting my I's that kind of thing.

14:00.209 --> 14:01.751
***

14:02.040 --> 14:04.070
You and your family are
involved with this, aren't you?

14:04.195 --> 14:07.133
Could there be more to this
guy than meets the dead eye?

14:07.472 --> 14:08.567
I doubt it.

14:08.692 --> 14:11.819
But he did mention
another possible attack,

14:11.834 --> 14:14.610
so the questions are still
nagging at me, that's all.

14:14.633 --> 14:16.714
But that monster carved up
two innocent people, Calvin.

14:16.839 --> 14:18.505
And if I need to question him, alone...

14:18.530 --> 14:20.564
He broke the law, that's
my jurisdiction, Calvin.

14:20.567 --> 14:22.499
What if you're wrong and this is mine?

14:22.509 --> 14:25.250
Listen, he's goin' to remain in
my custody until he stands trial.

14:25.267 --> 14:26.345
- May.
- No.

14:26.380 --> 14:28.933
If you talk to him, it
will be on the record.

14:29.033 --> 14:30.409
Isaac understood that.

14:31.428 --> 14:32.733
You need to let me do my job.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.796
If you're not gonna show your
intel on my investigation,

14:34.811 --> 14:36.144
we have nothing else to discuss.

14:36.174 --> 14:38.591
It's really not wise to
keep secrets from me, Calvin.

14:38.895 --> 14:40.716
We keep secrets for a reason.

14:42.402 --> 14:43.711
You know that.

14:44.646 --> 14:46.064
Enjoy your night, Calvin.

14:54.784 --> 14:58.133
- Where are you taking me?
- The holding into your arraignment tomorrow.

14:58.233 --> 14:59.734
If you behave.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.982
Get you some clean clothes to sleep in.

15:02.107 --> 15:04.355
That won't be necessary, Deputy.

15:06.700 --> 15:07.933
Here we are.

15:20.563 --> 15:21.712
My turn.

16:24.450 --> 16:28.081
I'm tellin' you, he knew
about Pop and the Dredge.

16:28.453 --> 16:30.014
He could have claimed
the information from me.

16:30.033 --> 16:31.507
That's why I can't tell about anything.

16:31.711 --> 16:34.467
The only way this guy can
know what he knows is from Pop.

16:34.485 --> 16:35.513
Hmm.

16:35.969 --> 16:38.895
I guess keeping secrets
runs in the family.

16:39.105 --> 16:40.697
Isaac doesn't keep secrets from me.

16:47.351 --> 16:49.416
It's cool. It's gotta be him.

16:51.027 --> 16:52.078
Mmm.

16:52.130 --> 16:54.629
So cool, he's greeting him with a gun.

17:02.911 --> 17:03.966
English.

17:09.133 --> 17:10.223
Malocchio.

17:11.162 --> 17:13.935
- The evil eye.
- Mom, it's cool. Relax.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.563
Hastings, you have nothing to fear.

17:16.567 --> 17:18.791
Though I am indeed evil by half.

17:23.481 --> 17:24.633
Forgive my manners.

17:24.723 --> 17:27.512
I would introduce myself but I
was never given a proper name.

17:27.815 --> 17:29.682
Though Isaac always called me James.

17:31.014 --> 17:33.343
How did you get out of jail, James?

17:33.534 --> 17:37.319
Deputy... was kind enough to
offer me a rid of safe passage.

17:39.292 --> 17:42.882
After assume, mildly applied
inspiration, of course.

17:43.407 --> 17:44.500
Of course.

18:00.862 --> 18:02.307
- Did you know that was there?
- No.

18:02.518 --> 18:03.899
Isaac's secret stash?

18:04.194 --> 18:07.042
We used to in our rum-running
days during Prohibition.

18:08.049 --> 18:12.160
Mortlach 1938, single malt whiskey.

18:13.820 --> 18:15.085
You're not human.

18:15.682 --> 18:17.541
- What kind of creature are you?
- All right, Mom...

18:17.581 --> 18:18.839
It's quite all right.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.799
Your mother's very astute
and only half wrong.

18:22.567 --> 18:25.537
I'm half human, half infernal.

18:26.030 --> 18:29.818
If that's true, how did you get
past the words protecting the house?

18:30.333 --> 18:32.011
I helped Isaac build those words.

18:32.326 --> 18:34.380
Their protective magic is easy to skirt

18:34.392 --> 18:36.381
if you know where they're buried.

18:43.667 --> 18:46.733
Isaac would never invite
an infernal into his house.

18:48.266 --> 18:49.563
How do you really know him?

18:51.720 --> 18:53.200
He's the reason I'm alive.

18:55.516 --> 18:58.783
Our human half in constant
war with our infernal one

18:58.800 --> 19:02.698
makes us a rare and
self-destructive breed.

19:03.192 --> 19:06.702
Violence is the only bond to
soothe that dark dichotomy.

19:06.827 --> 19:08.397
Violence onto humans.

19:08.791 --> 19:10.108
Quite the opposite.

19:10.645 --> 19:13.295
See, most humans killed
my kind upon discovery.

19:13.333 --> 19:16.256
Isaac Hastings saved
me from such a fate.

19:16.853 --> 19:21.634
He taught me how to redirect my
internal war to hunt infernals.

19:22.784 --> 19:24.511
Hunt them we did.

19:24.934 --> 19:27.333
Why else would he
send me in his absence?

19:27.433 --> 19:31.520
Do not believe a word
this vile creature says.

19:31.533 --> 19:32.810
I don't know, Bea.

19:32.834 --> 19:34.783
Seems like something Isaac would do.

19:36.067 --> 19:38.949
Doesn't explain the couple
people you killed today?

19:39.371 --> 19:41.105
I am many things, son of Isaac,

19:41.464 --> 19:43.159
but a murderer, I am not.

19:44.133 --> 19:45.686
Not of humans. Of course.

19:46.967 --> 19:48.050
Not yet.

19:53.167 --> 19:55.268
I say you don't look back.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.281
No ribs. No bones.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.740
Chest cavity is made
up of some kind of...

20:01.100 --> 20:02.284
I don't know.

20:02.340 --> 20:04.222
Whatever it is, it's not human.

20:04.253 --> 20:05.758
I told you, they're infernals.

20:07.923 --> 20:11.933
Skeleton explains your kind's
enhanced agility and strength.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.399
My kind?

20:13.423 --> 20:14.807
I have never had the opportunity

20:14.819 --> 20:16.948
to study an infernal sample this close.

20:17.467 --> 20:18.675
It's fascinating.

20:18.800 --> 20:19.949
How'd you know they weren't human?

20:20.074 --> 20:22.146
When I wake the sleeping giant inside,

20:22.571 --> 20:25.345
I see my kind, as you
say, for what they are.

20:25.536 --> 20:29.432
Handy for tracking, but it comes
with a nasty side effect of sobriety.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.114
Luckily there's a remedy.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.880
Isaac sent you to baby sit me

20:43.908 --> 20:46.157
while he chased across the
globe lookin' to lure the Dredge.

20:49.786 --> 20:51.123
You can't hear it.

20:51.477 --> 20:54.100
A low frequency hum
that's blanketing the town?

20:55.903 --> 20:57.000
I don't hear anything.

20:57.100 --> 20:58.733
The Dredger's sent his herald.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.439
War is coming to La Rochelle.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.123
And he's called in reinforcements.

21:03.248 --> 21:04.633
That's why you say more are coming.

21:09.004 --> 21:10.393
Are you expecting company?

21:12.100 --> 21:14.631
Front door.

21:20.892 --> 21:22.908
Calvin!

21:23.192 --> 21:24.200
Back door.

21:30.981 --> 21:32.342
I have all night.

21:34.034 --> 21:35.167
Back door?

21:35.444 --> 21:36.960
You seem to hear it a little better.

21:37.681 --> 21:40.308
Where is he? That murdering
lunatic escaped our custody today.

21:40.323 --> 21:42.261
In the process, he injured
four of my deputies.

21:42.285 --> 21:43.367
Did he kill any of them?

21:45.508 --> 21:48.448
No, he didn't kill anybody. But you
and I both know that's not the...

21:49.067 --> 21:50.076
He's in there, isn't he?

21:50.529 --> 21:52.260
-  Let me in.
- I can't do that right now. Um...

21:52.385 --> 21:54.373
You know, Mom is sleeping...

21:54.400 --> 21:56.016
- Don't...
- She's been sick, and,

21:56.141 --> 21:57.978
- I think you're in heightened excitement.
- My heightened excitement?

21:57.986 --> 21:59.717
You are harboring a
fugitive right now, Calvin.

21:59.733 --> 22:01.664
- That's a very serious allegation.
- It is serious!

22:01.666 --> 22:02.666
I'm gonna try not to take it personally.

22:02.675 --> 22:04.896
I would love to be wrong.
Prove me wrong. Let me in.

22:05.800 --> 22:07.781
- Okay. As soon as I see a warrant.
- Thank you.

22:08.167 --> 22:10.475
- Calvin, please, don't...
- You explained to me

22:10.535 --> 22:12.186
that the police station
is your jurisdiction,

22:12.198 --> 22:14.001
consider the Hastings funeral home mine.

22:17.352 --> 22:18.541
Look, May...

22:20.682 --> 22:22.812
I need you to trust me on this, okay?

22:22.836 --> 22:25.051
- When I come back... When I come back
- There is no other way around this.

22:25.109 --> 22:26.624
with my warrant,

22:27.000 --> 22:29.326
that murderer will not
be the only one in cuffs.

22:29.545 --> 22:30.676
Trust that.

22:36.916 --> 22:37.971
Thank you.

22:51.873 --> 22:53.297
Thought you were supposed
to be on your date.

22:53.934 --> 22:55.335
Not a date.

22:55.526 --> 22:58.000
Listen, do you still have
that file we discussed earlier?

22:58.100 --> 22:59.675
Secret life of Calvin Hastings?

22:59.689 --> 23:00.935
Yes. That one.

23:01.003 --> 23:02.086
Yeah.

23:02.165 --> 23:03.940
Wait a minute. You're no hacker.

23:03.963 --> 23:06.419
How did you get your hands on that
information in the first place?

23:06.789 --> 23:07.844
Classified.

23:07.880 --> 23:08.922
That means it was Russ.

23:08.925 --> 23:09.925
We need to talk about him,

23:09.933 --> 23:12.393
I'm not sure that he's
the best fit for you, okay?

23:12.485 --> 23:14.112
Yeah, yeah, we're both shattered.

23:14.271 --> 23:15.308
What did you say?

23:15.489 --> 23:16.846
Nothing. I said I have it.

23:17.152 --> 23:19.381
Listen, just bring the
files to the office, please.

23:19.421 --> 23:21.160
Okay. I'll be there in ten.

23:21.285 --> 23:22.358
Thank you.

23:27.013 --> 23:28.725
Son, we need to talk.

23:29.050 --> 23:31.792
Ma, I'll smooth things out with
May later. I just can't right now.

23:31.833 --> 23:33.041
It's about James.

23:34.494 --> 23:37.209
You know better than anyone
you can't trust infernals.

23:38.789 --> 23:41.392
- Arlo died because...
- Arlo died because of Isaac.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.309
You know it wasn't as simple as that.

23:44.468 --> 23:47.292
Infernals are still serving
backstabbing creatures of chaos.

23:47.528 --> 23:48.885
And you're putting your trust in him?

23:50.087 --> 23:53.012
- Not all of it.
- James possesses only half their traits

23:53.024 --> 23:54.266
and even he can't escape their violence.

23:54.286 --> 23:55.534
Then why would Pop send him here?

23:55.535 --> 23:56.466
That's got to count for something.

23:56.482 --> 23:58.285
Maybe Isaac sent him, maybe he didn't.

23:58.321 --> 24:00.334
But you're going to take
the word of a half-infernal?

24:00.871 --> 24:02.173
If James is telling the truth,

24:02.200 --> 24:04.183
and the Dredge is sending
an army of infernals

24:04.200 --> 24:07.004
to La Rochelle, he can help
us. I can't just ignore that!

24:07.033 --> 24:09.722
- Isaac wouldn't just ignore that!
- If you're wrong,

24:09.847 --> 24:12.267
and he's running a
game on you, then what?

24:12.318 --> 24:13.599
Look, Ma...

24:14.900 --> 24:17.925
You raised us to always
look beyond the skin

24:18.268 --> 24:19.490
and into the soul.

24:20.242 --> 24:22.386
Infernals don't have souls!

24:30.244 --> 24:31.523
I guess we're about to find out.

24:38.260 --> 24:40.107
How did you beat the lock on the door?

24:40.232 --> 24:42.627
A blind halfwit warlock
could pick that lock.

24:42.717 --> 24:45.900
Perhaps you should consider a
glamour ward to mask the door.

24:46.266 --> 24:47.413
Good to know.

24:47.759 --> 24:50.461
Apologies. I couldn't resist.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.793
I didn't have much time
to gather my belongings.

24:52.813 --> 24:54.039
They are in police custody.

24:55.015 --> 24:56.062
Yeah.

24:56.216 --> 24:57.800
Just your hat and flask, right?

24:57.960 --> 24:59.615
Just the essentials, yes.

25:01.467 --> 25:02.919
I don't mean to seem ungrateful,

25:02.947 --> 25:05.283
but this thing you have
with killing infernals...

25:06.172 --> 25:07.480
- Why?
- Huh?

25:07.723 --> 25:09.427
Remember when you were a kid

25:09.653 --> 25:11.588
with a magnifying glass?

25:11.767 --> 25:14.100
And then you found the anthill.

25:15.277 --> 25:16.479
It's like that.

25:19.014 --> 25:20.144
What are we up against?

25:20.269 --> 25:22.990
The herald was once a
handmaiden to Persephone,

25:23.115 --> 25:24.967
with a voice so beautiful

25:24.995 --> 25:26.399
that when she sang...

25:30.667 --> 25:31.933
Siren's call.

25:32.436 --> 25:35.413
In Greek mythology, they used it
to lure sailors to their deaths.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.398
That's a superstition.

25:38.211 --> 25:39.631
But now she works for the Dredge.

25:39.643 --> 25:42.842
And he has cursed her with
the most monstrous form

25:42.967 --> 25:44.860
and a voice so cruel,

25:45.274 --> 25:46.655
it's a herald of war.

25:47.867 --> 25:50.302
- You can still hear her call.
- Yes.

25:50.520 --> 25:53.116
She is luring the most vile

25:53.757 --> 25:56.871
and ruthless infernals
from miles around.

25:57.655 --> 26:01.139
Even now, it pushes me towards violence.

26:01.976 --> 26:03.035
Good.

26:03.280 --> 26:04.769
That means you can track them.

26:05.367 --> 26:07.910
We can hunt this herald
and kill the rest.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.637
Hmm.

26:14.095 --> 26:15.675
This is my jam.

26:24.512 --> 26:25.700
Yeah, this is a great idea!

26:25.778 --> 26:27.971
- Boom! Boom!
- Oh, my God!

26:28.202 --> 26:30.431
- What?
- We should totally go skinny dipping!

26:30.500 --> 26:31.625
What?

26:31.750 --> 26:32.958
Oh, come on!

26:33.000 --> 26:35.991
- The water's just right.
- My trunks are in the tent.

26:36.007 --> 26:38.638
- Who needs a suit?
- That's right! Whoo!

26:39.231 --> 26:41.333
Okay. I'll be there in a second, okay?

26:58.315 --> 27:01.000
Funny, funny, guys.

27:01.069 --> 27:03.349
You guys got me! Whoo.

27:03.667 --> 27:05.304
All right, if you're not gonna come in,

27:05.316 --> 27:07.027
I'm gonna come out after you.

27:09.667 --> 27:11.429
All right, here I come!

27:15.615 --> 27:17.773
Come on, you guys. Game's up.

27:20.933 --> 27:22.169
Where are you?

27:26.867 --> 27:29.054
Help me!

27:29.067 --> 27:32.326
- Help! I can't...
- Nancy. Come on. Come on.

27:32.333 --> 27:33.400
Come on.

27:33.500 --> 27:34.727
Come on. Nancy, stay with me.

27:34.755 --> 27:36.508
Hey, it's okay. Come on.

27:38.024 --> 27:40.520
Nancy. Nancy, stay with me, okay?

27:40.560 --> 27:42.662
Are you okay? Shit!

27:43.111 --> 27:45.100
Oh... Shit!

27:46.400 --> 27:47.934
Oh, shit! Nancy!

28:13.933 --> 28:15.008
Hi, Caroline.

28:15.047 --> 28:16.452
Let's make sure this is
done right, all right?

28:16.480 --> 28:18.339
I need all of that
evidence bagged and tagged.

28:20.186 --> 28:22.935
Calvin, where are you, huh?

28:23.349 --> 28:25.207
Got a bloodbath over here at the quarry.

28:26.600 --> 28:27.965
Seems to be your guy's M.O.

28:28.418 --> 28:31.423
We've got heads twisted
around the bodies,

28:31.805 --> 28:33.398
and from the looks of things it seems

28:33.399 --> 28:35.628
that he has extended his repertoire.

28:37.789 --> 28:38.939
Calvin, where are you?

28:46.779 --> 28:47.877
Message from May.

28:47.917 --> 28:49.732
Attack near the north quarry. Five dead.

28:49.748 --> 28:51.738
- You are the primary suspect.
- Hmm.

28:51.921 --> 28:53.233
This will be your lady friend,

28:53.261 --> 28:54.376
- the police chief?
- Ah, don't.

28:54.501 --> 28:55.943
You can't tell her you're with me,

28:55.967 --> 28:57.775
because if she interferes
it'll slow us down.

28:57.790 --> 28:59.910
Yet you need her information.

29:00.035 --> 29:02.342
Complicated by the
fact that you fancy her,

29:02.390 --> 29:05.108
and this could do some
irreparable damage.

29:05.319 --> 29:06.433
On the other hand,

29:06.481 --> 29:09.208
if you like her and she
likes you, who gives a shit?

29:09.426 --> 29:10.893
You should really write Hallmark cards.

29:10.934 --> 29:14.467
My point is, complications are
where the good stuff is in life.

29:15.867 --> 29:17.077
Huh.

29:17.638 --> 29:20.157
- Didn't think you'd notice that.
- Yeah. I did.

29:20.344 --> 29:21.721
It's going back in the Alchemy room.

29:21.764 --> 29:22.767
The trail?

29:22.892 --> 29:25.112
We'll circle back and
the trail will be fresh.

29:26.133 --> 29:27.830
No, we can hunt down
the stragglers after.

29:29.827 --> 29:31.602
What if we kill the herald,

29:31.949 --> 29:34.312
then the stragglers are
scattered in the four winds

29:34.320 --> 29:35.595
and the town will be safe?

29:36.351 --> 29:37.907
I don't want to go after the herald.

29:38.267 --> 29:41.286
Infernals from miles around

29:41.624 --> 29:43.408
are gathering to hear the songs.

29:43.475 --> 29:45.484
We could kill all of them.

29:46.069 --> 29:47.153
In the quarry.

29:53.515 --> 29:54.600
Quarry.

30:09.780 --> 30:10.811
Slow down.

30:11.045 --> 30:12.140
I'm human.

30:12.233 --> 30:14.149
I don't have your infernal stamina.

30:19.282 --> 30:21.108
English!

30:21.233 --> 30:24.169
The apple has certainly
fallen far from the tree.

30:24.555 --> 30:25.892
I am not my father.

30:26.844 --> 30:28.643
Then Isaac never could've
kept up with his pace.

30:28.667 --> 30:32.175
Are you familiar with
the Battle of New Orleans?

30:32.300 --> 30:33.648
In 1815,

30:33.715 --> 30:37.667
the British decided to take the
newly annexed port city for the Crown.

30:37.886 --> 30:41.600
Everyone, town folk, pirates,
General Jackson and his army,

30:41.700 --> 30:43.625
united to rebel against
the British invasion

30:43.644 --> 30:48.057
in what is known to be the most
lopsided victory on record to this day.

30:48.061 --> 30:50.731
The Brits lost 2,000
to New Orleans's eight.

30:50.856 --> 30:52.442
Top marks!

30:52.801 --> 30:55.731
What you didn't know was that
two men went behind enemy lines,

30:55.856 --> 30:58.811
decimated the British before
Americans ever got to them.

30:59.067 --> 31:01.155
- You?
- And your daddy.

31:02.505 --> 31:03.833
Try to keep up.

31:07.778 --> 31:09.422
What do we have here?

31:14.233 --> 31:15.921
A fumbling half-breed.

31:16.669 --> 31:18.332
And his sidekick.

31:21.723 --> 31:23.433
Shall we kill them both?

31:24.033 --> 31:25.066
The human.

31:25.392 --> 31:27.235
But let's save James for the Dredge.

31:28.118 --> 31:30.093
His suffering will be legendary.

31:33.554 --> 31:34.681
Two more at our six.

31:35.562 --> 31:37.003
Not the best odds.

31:37.367 --> 31:39.298
Do your thing, son of Isaac.

31:48.197 --> 31:50.467
- What?
- Use the ring.

31:52.735 --> 31:54.633
Oh, you've got to be shitting me.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.716
Let's go, half-breed.

32:14.579 --> 32:15.610
Aah!

32:32.533 --> 32:33.667
No.

32:41.725 --> 32:43.083
He's got Solomon's ring.

32:43.118 --> 32:44.953
- Brothers, flee!
- Go!

33:04.882 --> 33:05.933
What are you lookin' at?

33:08.762 --> 33:10.860
Hey, hey, hey, you OK?

33:10.985 --> 33:12.687
Come on, come on. You all right?

33:12.962 --> 33:15.233
- I got you.
- I can barely see, this is your fault.

33:15.333 --> 33:16.400
My fault?

33:16.611 --> 33:18.725
You are welcome for me
saving your life back there.

33:18.740 --> 33:20.380
They took my eye,.

33:20.404 --> 33:21.813
What am I suppose to
check them with now?

33:21.837 --> 33:23.460
It's your desperado bullshit

33:23.464 --> 33:25.072
that got us into a
trap in the first place.

33:25.084 --> 33:26.342
If the infernals take over,

33:26.374 --> 33:28.869
they will turn this plane
into infernal Garden of Eden.

33:28.913 --> 33:31.922
You had the ring of Solomon,
why didn't you use it?

33:33.772 --> 33:35.125
Then why bother, huh?

33:35.250 --> 33:36.625
There's a chance they will take me...

33:36.657 --> 33:38.292
Whatever, man, it's not what I did.

33:38.913 --> 33:42.419
The ring was made to bend
infernals to its wearer's will,

33:42.467 --> 33:43.900
and you use it like a damn trinket.

33:44.146 --> 33:46.252
Why didn't you use its power?

33:46.264 --> 33:47.601
I don't know how to use it.

33:48.533 --> 33:49.592
Isaac never taught.

33:49.600 --> 33:51.208
Isaac teaches all his descendants

33:51.224 --> 33:52.708
how to fight and eradicate evil.

33:52.716 --> 33:54.002
Haven't you ever wondered what happened

33:54.010 --> 33:55.856
to the rest of your
brothers and sisters?

33:57.918 --> 33:59.617
Isaac never told you.

34:00.441 --> 34:02.737
I had one brother, his name was Arlo.

34:04.033 --> 34:06.499
Your roots go far deeper than that.

34:06.933 --> 34:09.248
Isaac has had many
families over the years,

34:09.273 --> 34:12.179
he's turned warriors
of them all, except you.

34:12.648 --> 34:13.953
No wonder he sent me,

34:14.223 --> 34:15.840
he can't trust his own son.

34:16.425 --> 34:17.882
Now why would that be, huh?

34:17.960 --> 34:19.507
What was your failing?

34:20.090 --> 34:22.315
Are you responsible for
the death of a friend,

34:22.809 --> 34:24.166
a family member?

34:24.942 --> 34:26.041
Ah...

34:29.193 --> 34:30.503
Your brother, Arlo?

34:36.380 --> 34:39.569
Infernal, you will keep my
brother's name out of your mouth.

34:41.201 --> 34:42.319
He'd still be alive if it wasn't for...

34:42.355 --> 34:44.081
If it wasn't for
infernals, is that right?

34:44.396 --> 34:48.025
You can't get past the infernal blood
that's coursing through my veins.

34:48.033 --> 34:49.578
You don't give me any reason to not to.

34:49.600 --> 34:52.244
Congratulations. Racism suits you.

34:52.284 --> 34:53.475
Racism?

34:53.801 --> 34:55.835
Admit it, you hate all infernals.

34:56.168 --> 34:59.118
You Hastings are born to hunt
us down and kill us on sight.

34:59.154 --> 35:00.288
If I wanted you dead,

35:00.805 --> 35:03.344
you would be dead.

35:04.478 --> 35:05.800
Was that good for you?

35:06.133 --> 35:08.398
I love the sound of an empty threat.

35:09.033 --> 35:10.746
Isaac has made warriors for centuries,

35:10.774 --> 35:13.908
look at the weak litter
he's made now. Pathetic.

35:14.033 --> 35:15.069
You're no warrior.

35:15.194 --> 35:17.282
Warriors don't go out like cobardes.

35:17.609 --> 35:18.843
You play at war.

35:19.002 --> 35:20.745
When you play at war, soldiers die.

35:20.767 --> 35:22.039
Like your brother Arlo.

35:28.057 --> 35:29.200
Hit me again.

35:29.636 --> 35:32.565
Won't change the fact that
Arlo died on your watch.

35:32.690 --> 35:35.328
The fact that you can't
recover makes you damaged goods.

35:35.392 --> 35:37.367
Isaac knows it. Now so do I.

35:45.433 --> 35:46.440
You knew.

35:46.647 --> 35:47.965
Suspected.

35:49.095 --> 35:52.133
I thought again you fired
up, I sharpen up your focus.

35:52.379 --> 35:54.200
Enough to activate the ring's power.

35:57.636 --> 35:59.956
I've seen Isaac use it.
But I don't know how.

36:00.299 --> 36:03.220
Because I'm a mixed
heritage, I can't touch it.

36:06.958 --> 36:08.057
Hey,

36:08.773 --> 36:09.967
I'm sorry about your eye.

36:12.116 --> 36:14.308
I'm gonna find another
way to track the infernals.

36:15.328 --> 36:17.293
Well, you're the hero now.

36:17.719 --> 36:19.920
Not gonna take you
before you were ready.

36:21.993 --> 36:23.004
Can you fight?

36:24.139 --> 36:25.409
A la fiesta.

36:30.300 --> 36:31.541
A la fiesta.

36:36.914 --> 36:38.781
Remember, the herald will lure you.

36:38.956 --> 36:40.766
To stop it, you must use the ring

36:40.786 --> 36:42.408
or all is lost.

36:46.179 --> 36:47.269
You sure it's here?

36:47.846 --> 36:50.094
Herald's using the
cavern as an echo chamber.

36:50.367 --> 36:51.933
The call's deafening from here.

36:52.367 --> 36:53.591
I'll take lead.

37:39.084 --> 37:40.775
You're so beautiful.

37:46.690 --> 37:48.893
I've never heard
anything like this before.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.261
Focus!

37:57.421 --> 37:58.933
Focus, Calvin.

37:59.962 --> 38:02.201
Focus on Arlo!

38:25.728 --> 38:28.111
Waste not, want not.

38:53.852 --> 38:56.120
How do you think I got the last one?

39:12.766 --> 39:13.955
Hey, James,

39:14.542 --> 39:15.667
sure you can't stay?

39:17.895 --> 39:20.691
I still have a lot of questions
about Isaac and this ring.

39:21.806 --> 39:23.502
I could use another warrior.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.442
You forget I'm a wanted man.

39:26.867 --> 39:28.835
The herald's call still went out.

39:29.631 --> 39:30.975
More are coming.

39:31.994 --> 39:34.034
The Dredger's marked
your family for death.

39:34.457 --> 39:37.008
I'm gonna go after the
infernals that answered his call.

39:37.242 --> 39:40.376
Buy you more time to learn
about the ring and your heritage.

39:42.146 --> 39:43.420
For what it's worth,

39:43.738 --> 39:45.340
Isaac will be proud.

40:13.952 --> 40:15.792
See you around, son of Isaac.

40:16.165 --> 40:17.568
I'll keep an eye out for you.

40:21.349 --> 40:22.986
In English.

40:24.632 --> 40:26.553
Yeah, that is a warrant, all right?

40:27.233 --> 40:28.633
Sorry about last night.

40:32.364 --> 40:33.975
Nobody here but us.

40:34.255 --> 40:36.827
Feel free to take a look around
if it'll make you feel better.

40:40.806 --> 40:43.134
Two hunters spotted
my perp, earlier today.

40:43.333 --> 40:45.258
I put out an APB, so I will get him,

40:45.283 --> 40:48.690
but you need to understand I
am not one of your subordinates.

40:49.033 --> 40:52.089
Isaac and I have an understanding
as to how to keep La Rochelle safe.

40:52.100 --> 40:55.327
He trusts my judgment and so
should you, but even if you don't...

40:55.500 --> 40:58.386
Know this, I am the law.

40:59.200 --> 41:00.278
Fair enough,

41:00.919 --> 41:02.133
no more secrets.

41:02.533 --> 41:05.355
Next time, we work together, Chief.

41:13.129 --> 41:14.647
Conrad, it's me.

41:15.547 --> 41:17.139
Yeah, uh...

41:17.597 --> 41:21.323
Listen, um, I'm calling
in a solid. I owe you one.

41:22.318 --> 41:24.904
I need the military records
for one Calvin Hastings.

41:31.128 --> 41:32.767
Hunter Hastings.

41:33.620 --> 41:35.187
Iris Hastings.

41:38.331 --> 41:40.533
Demi Hastings.

41:44.467 --> 41:45.800
Hastings.

41:46.319 --> 41:47.833
Hastings.

41:56.233 --> 41:57.507
You found them.

42:03.033 --> 42:04.293
They're all Hastings.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.633
James said Isaac had other families.

42:08.733 --> 42:10.586
I wasn't expecting all this.

42:11.267 --> 42:12.685
He felt it best to keep it for you

42:12.705 --> 42:14.670
until you're old enough to understand.

42:15.531 --> 42:17.919
- But then you...
- Then I went off to the Marines.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.630
So many secrets.

42:22.500 --> 42:24.455
From the outside perhaps.

42:25.475 --> 42:27.615
But now that you've
begun to come back in.

42:32.434 --> 42:33.927
What does all this mean, Ma?

42:36.333 --> 42:37.568
Why do we do

42:38.444 --> 42:39.772
what we do?

42:42.533 --> 42:44.857
