- Give him some room!

04:12.880 --> 04:14.836
Why wouldn't they listen, Nick?

04:14.960 --> 04:18.236
We told 'em it's too dangerous
to launch this operation at night.

04:18.360 --> 04:21.238
They thought their plan was better.

04:21.360 --> 04:25.672
I spent five years in Vietnam watching
them do the planning... and us the dying.

04:26.840 --> 04:30.116
Well... I'm resigning when I get back.

- Congratulations.

06:10.240 --> 06:14.199
We'd have divorced years ago but
neither of us wanted custody of our kids.

06:14.320 --> 06:18.279

up to him, he would spoil 'em rotten.

Deborah, let her have
the doll she wants. She's a baby!

06:41.760 --> 06:44.399
Momma, she's not a baby.
And you're spoiling her.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.988
I'm not. I didn't do
such a bad job with you.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.954
Harry wanted to buy me a new ring
for our anniversary. I said no.

06:51.080 --> 06:53.958

Are you all right, sister?

10:12.600 --> 10:15.239

I am from Chicago myself. I must have
seen you somewhere in Chicago.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.479
- You don't sound like Chicago.
- I've only been in Chicago four years.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.716

- Russian.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.280
<i>Your plane is now headed</i>
<i>for a new destination.</i>

17:34.400 --> 17:37.710
For your safety, I suggest
you listen carefully...

17:37.840 --> 17:39.717
...and follow all instructions.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.393
- Harry.
- What?

17:44.520 --> 17:46.272
My ring, it's Hebrew.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.356
Take it off. Put it in your purse.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.192
<i>(Harry)</i> Take it off.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.596
Harry, there's a white mark on my hand.
Think they'll notice?

18:00.600 --> 18:02.556
Will you marry me?

18:04.520 --> 18:07.080
Oh, Harry! What's gonna happen to us?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.478
One thing is certain.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.275
We'll always remember
our silver wedding anniversary.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.709
<i>(man whispers)</i> Let's do something.

18:15.840 --> 18:18.479
- It's only two of 'em. We can take 'em.
- Shh!

18:18.600 --> 18:21.592
It's not a good idea.
These guys are dangerous.

18:21.720 --> 18:26.669
If they're gonna blow this plane up, that's
a lot of people. We gotta play their game.

18:26.800 --> 18:27.994
All right!

18:28.120 --> 18:30.031
You can all sit up now!

18:30.160 --> 18:31.718
But nobody talks!

18:31.840 --> 18:33.796
Nobody move!

18:37.480 --> 18:38.799
Excuse me, sir.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.354
- This young lady is preg...
- Shut up!

18:41.480 --> 18:43.232
Please, I'm not feeling well.

Hurry up!

20:01.480 --> 20:04.233
We're coming, we're coming. It's OK.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.316
Move! Move!

20:07.400 --> 20:09.755

Keep quiet.

Silence!

20:54.880 --> 20:56.996
It's a nice doll. What is your name?

20:57.120 --> 20:58.712
Ellen.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.831
Ellen. It's a very nice name.

21:02.520 --> 21:05.239
- How old are you, Ellen?
- Six.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.316
You know, Ellen...

21:07.440 --> 21:09.635
...I had a daughter exactly your age.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.398
Her name was Salima.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.231
You understand, Ellen?

21:15.280 --> 21:17.236
Good. Good. Take it.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.952
Thank you.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.116
Go, go, go, go. Go!

Hey, Ace. You think
the Captain's gonna show up?

21:42.240 --> 21:44.993
- I'll be damned if he doesn't.
- Wasn't he called?

21:45.120 --> 21:48.351
Who'd call <i>him?</i> He's retired
to that old horse farm of his.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.870
Though I must admit I wouldn't mind
havin? Captain McCoy along.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.072
- I took the liberty of giving him a call, sir.
- You what?!

21:55.200 --> 21:56.633
He wasn't at home.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.990
He just might be on his way here, Colonel.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.076
Nah... None of that.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.156
That looks good.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.589
Oh, yeah. <i>(chuckles)</i>

22:05.720 --> 22:07.153
Pull down the shades!

22:07.280 --> 22:10.317
Pull down the shades.
Pull the shades down! All of you!

22:10.440 --> 22:11.998
Shades down!

22:13.160 --> 22:14.718
Pull them down!

22:17.240 --> 22:20.277
All right! Pull them down,
all these window shades!

22:20.400 --> 22:22.630
Pull the shades down. Pull the shades.

22:41.840 --> 22:42.716
Pull these down!

What is it?

22:45.720 --> 22:46.675
Come quick.

22:46.840 --> 22:47.795
What?

22:49.280 --> 22:50.235
Look.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.272
This is Hebrew.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.277
There are Israelis here.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.711
<i>(Abdul)</i> Come here!

23:01.160 --> 23:02.309
Come here!

23:07.600 --> 23:10.160
There are Israelis aboard this airplane.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.430
I want you to identify them for me.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.438
We don't know who the Israelis are.
How could we?

23:15.560 --> 23:18.632
They came off the El Al flight!
And I will find them.

23:22.080 --> 23:23.672
Collect all passports.

23:24.120 --> 23:25.997
- Why?
- Do it!

23:26.720 --> 23:28.278
OK.

23:33.280 --> 23:37.637
Ladies and gentlemen, attention. They
want all of you to turn in your passports.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.716
So, please, get out your passports...

23:39.840 --> 23:41.910
...and hold them over your head.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.395
- Why?
- I don't know why.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.799
<i>(stewardess)</i> Thank you.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.830
Mustafa, watch her.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.793
Just be quiet and
do what they tell you to do.

24:19.920 --> 24:22.309
No! Just women! You go back! Go back!

24:22.440 --> 24:25.716
<i>(nun)</i> Miss, did they tell you
why they want our passports?

24:25.840 --> 24:27.193
Will we get 'em back?

24:54.240 --> 24:57.391
Put them here!
All of them! I want all of them!

24:57.520 --> 25:00.478
No cheating. I know
there are 144 passengers.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.477
Ingrid is getting the rest.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.956
Excuse me, miss. We don't have
passports. We're in the Navy.

25:06.080 --> 25:08.275
- We have these Navy IDs.
- Hide them away.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.516
<i>(whispers)</i> Hide it, man. Put it away.

25:10.640 --> 25:14.155
Hey, you. Why didn't you
collect these men's passports?

25:14.280 --> 25:17.238
- They don't have passports.
- You are lying.

25:17.360 --> 25:20.397
No, wait a second. We have these.
We have these.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.476
It's a Navy ID.

25:23.680 --> 25:27.036
- Marines.
- No. We're divers for the American Navy.

25:27.160 --> 25:29.879
- You?
- All three of us. We're all Navy.

25:30.720 --> 25:35.669
Marines. American Marines killed many
of my friends when they bombed Beirut!

25:35.800 --> 25:37.358
America never bombed Beirut.

25:37.480 --> 25:40.233
Planes from your ship <i>New Jersey</i>
bombed our camps!

25:40.360 --> 25:43.079
- Relax.
- Son, you're making a mistake.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.156
America never bombed Beirut.

25:45.280 --> 25:47.475
- Your American ship!
- <i>(woman)</i> No!

25:48.240 --> 25:49.195
No!

25:49.320 --> 25:51.276
<i>(all protest)</i>

25:53.080 --> 25:55.036
Stop! He's a priest!

25:56.880 --> 25:59.075
Enough, enough!

26:02.440 --> 26:06.069
These three are
American Marines. Look.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.113
Oh, yes?

26:09.840 --> 26:11.990
Three American heroes.

26:12.120 --> 26:15.635
From now on, you travel
only first class, gentlemen.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.680
- What's goin? on here?
- Shut up.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.916
- Why do you want us...
- Just shut up!

26:30.480 --> 26:32.232
Come here.

26:32.360 --> 26:34.237
Hold this.

26:53.760 --> 26:55.830
Please, please, just be quiet.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.359
OK?

26:57.480 --> 26:59.835
Everything will be all right.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.236
Listen. You don't have to do that.

27:06.360 --> 27:08.590
- We'll cooperate.
- Shut up. Sit down.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.316
Sit... down!

27:11.440 --> 27:12.953
Now you listen to me.

27:13.080 --> 27:15.674
Look at these passports one by one.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.268
Pick out the passport with Jewish names.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.595
American passports do not state religion.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.870
Give me the Israelis.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.718
There are no Israelis on board.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.630
Then pick out the Jewish names.

27:29.760 --> 27:33.878
I told you, there is no way
I can know who is a Jew. How can I?

27:34.000 --> 27:34.910
Do it!

27:35.040 --> 27:37.838
I can't! I won't do it!

27:37.960 --> 27:39.791
Yes, you will do it!

27:39.920 --> 27:41.114
No, not me!

27:41.240 --> 27:43.549
Don't you see? I'm German!

27:45.280 --> 27:48.192
- What does that mean?
- The selections.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.638
The Nazis!

27:50.760 --> 27:52.478
The death camps!

27:52.600 --> 27:55.319
Don't you see I can't do
what you want me to do?

28:00.880 --> 28:02.836
Very sorry, dear lady.

28:03.880 --> 28:06.997
But... you <i>must</i> do this for us.

28:14.280 --> 28:17.511
You claim you belong to
a revolutionary organisation.

28:17.640 --> 28:22.236
That is correct. We are freedom fighters.
We are fighting for our brothers.

28:22.360 --> 28:25.238
But then you don't want
to be associated with Nazis...

28:25.360 --> 28:27.316
...who killed six million Jews.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.396
Not enough, lady! Not enough.

28:29.520 --> 28:31.988
The Jews stole Palestine.
They took our lands.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.429
Leave her! With no gun,
you wouldn't be shit!

28:34.560 --> 28:38.075
- Shut up, you American imperialist pig!
- Stop it, please!

28:38.200 --> 28:40.350
You are all pigs and killers!

28:40.520 --> 28:41.953
Don't kill him, please!

28:43.560 --> 28:45.869
Stop him! Don't let him kill him!

28:46.000 --> 28:47.274
<i>(sound of punches)</i>

28:47.400 --> 28:50.039
You will do what Abdul said!

28:50.160 --> 28:52.958
He is your new captain,
and you obey or you die.

28:53.080 --> 28:55.036
Do you hear me? You die!

28:55.160 --> 28:58.436
We will kill everyone on this bloody plane.

28:59.320 --> 29:02.118
No! I won't do it!

29:03.720 --> 29:05.119
Yes!

29:08.720 --> 29:12.679
What's going on, Colonel? Men and
equipment are aboard. What's the delay?

29:12.800 --> 29:14.950
- I'll give him five more minutes.
- Who?

29:15.080 --> 29:18.231
Oh, uh, nothing, sir.
Just... Just a few more minutes.

29:18.360 --> 29:20.476
<i>(vehicle approaches in distance)</i>

29:21.280 --> 29:22.679
Colonel?

29:22.800 --> 29:24.756
<i>(tyres screech)</i>

29:34.240 --> 29:36.356
Well, it's about time you showed up.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.675
I was afraid I was gonna have to use this.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.153
What is it?

29:40.280 --> 29:43.272
A presidential decree
ordering you back to duty.

29:44.680 --> 29:46.830
And you can leave the keys
in the van, too.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.916
I've got your gear on the plane.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.792
General, we're all set.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.878
- How was your engagement party?
- A little cut short.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.468
- Bobby, good to see you.
- Welcome back, boss.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.556
- Do you know who that guy is?
- No!

29:59.520 --> 30:01.636
- Well, let's go do it.
- Let's do it!

30:03.080 --> 30:05.913
- Great to see you.
- Good to see you, Captain Jack.

30:08.280 --> 30:11.556
- Don't make me carry your ass this time.
- No way, Captain.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.113
Uh... Major.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.196
Yes, sir, Major!

30:18.680 --> 30:21.433
- What the hell, huh?
- Congratulations.

30:50.680 --> 30:52.159
Ladies and gentlemen...

30:52.280 --> 30:55.352
<i>(PA)... this is your new captain speaking.</i>

30:55.480 --> 30:57.835
<i>Miss Ingrid will read some names...</i>

30:57.960 --> 31:01.077
- What are they doing?
<i>...immediately to first-class cabin.</i>

31:01.200 --> 31:03.555
<i>I repeat: immediately.</i>

31:13.000 --> 31:14.479
Kaplan, Benjamin.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.955
<i>(Ingrid) Mr Benjamin Kaplan.</i>

31:17.600 --> 31:20.353
This... can't be happening.
Not... not again.

31:20.480 --> 31:22.038
Not again.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.269
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

31:25.400 --> 31:27.960
- Don't go.
- We... We survived once.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.389
We can do it again.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.956
I'm coming.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.036
<i>(soft crying)</i>

31:42.000 --> 31:44.195

They were in every part of that plane with

Colonel, I assume your Mossad still has
people planted in Lebanon, right?

Your assumption is correct.

- Do some reckoning before the rescue?

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.716
- It'd be a great help to us, Colonel.
- If I may suggest...

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.879
- They've announced a press conference.
- Ah, of course.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.678
So you're Canadian.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.951
You're blessed with
a beautiful and peaceful country.

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.036
I'd like to go there myself one day.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.072
Well, it's beautiful country here.
It's a shame.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:04.159
- Do you know where we need to go?
- Yes, my son. We're on our way.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.236
You'll need these.

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:31.716
If you look down to your right,
you'll see the main sewer pipe.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.194
It leads directly
to the backyard of the school.

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:38.675
That is where most of the hostages are.

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.756
No. Go and do what you have to do.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.872
Under the seat you'll find something
you might need... just in case.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.956
Don't take too long.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:26.113
Boss, aren't we trusting this guy
a bit too much?

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:29.595
The Israelis say
he's the best man they have in Lebanon.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:32.871
And we need someone
to get the message back to Nick.

- Yeah, I'm OK, boss.

Well, I can't wait any longer.

Otherwise we'll miss that rendezvous.

We need another vehicle here.

We've got one.

You don't need beds.
You're gonna die tomorrow.

Scott, that must be them.

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.916
About a mile offshore, I'd say.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.992
- You OK?
- Yeah. You?

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:55.317
- Good to be on dry land. How we doin'?
- We have three targets.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.591
A school in north Beirut beach.
60 hostages are there.

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:01.951
- Do you know where that is?
- By the Greek Orthodox cemetery?

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.638
Yeah, right.

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:08.038
The Jews are being held in a dungeon at
their headquarters in the centre of town.

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:10.720
And the ATW crew is still
being held on the plane.

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:14.116
- We'll have to get them last.
- Right. And I drew a map here.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:18.028
All right, everybody! Get your badges on!
We move out in two minutes!

- They are here.
- Who?

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:24.994
The Americans.

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.997
Americans?

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:30.478
Get up... all of you. Quickly!

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.351
You are all coming with me.

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.078

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.435
OK.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.835
- God be with us.
- God be praised.

Come on, let's move out.
Quickly! Move your ass!

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.079
That's the place.

Good luck.

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.873

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:17.917
All right.

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.234
Did they eat?

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.954
They ate and went to sleep.

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:49.636
Why do you look at me like that?

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.356
You hate me, huh?

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.193
It's your government we fight, not you.

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:03.470
It's your White House.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.989
One day I will go there.

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.475
I will drive a truck...

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.239
...and truck, it will blow.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.794
No, that'll be suicide. You know that.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:15.913
I know how to die.

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:19.237
The White House is very big.
You'll need a lot of explosives.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.158
You'll never get near the place.
Don't kid yourself.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:25.029
Do you think we don't have
friends in America?

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.916
You will be surprised.

I hear you, Jamil.

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.510
We just received a message
from Khomeini.

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:57.436
Did he agree?

01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:59.755
The Ayatollah will welcome you
and your hostages.

01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:01.837
God be praised, Jamil.

01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.191
You'll be met by General Mahamuzi.

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.914
He'll take you through Syria
and on to the Ayatollah.

OK, let's move!

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:30.071
Damn. It's gonna be light soon.

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:34.113
- Take off. I'll delay the reinforcements.
- OK. Then you join Pete.

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:37.516
- I'll see you at the airport.
- I won't be able to wait for you.

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:39.153
- Then don't wait.
- I won't!

01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:43.239
Bobby, stick with the Major, then take
my vehicle. I'll meet you at the orchard.

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.713
Let's go! Come on.

01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:57.677
Delta Two, this is Delta One. Over.

01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:59.995
- What's the plan, boss?
- A surprise party.

01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:01.838
- Just like the old days.
- You got it.

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:04.918
- Delta Two, come in.
- I'll prepare the upper floors.

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:06.996
Yeah, I'm here, Major.

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:10.590

- Well, those bastards snaked us, boss.

No one moves without my order.

It looks like the Americans are still here.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.358
I'm afraid we are too late.

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:41.550
Maybe it's a trap, looks like an ambush.

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:42.954
I don't think so.

01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:49.236
Commander... I think you are wrong.

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:54.955
