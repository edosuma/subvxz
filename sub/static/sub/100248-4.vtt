00:15.500 --> 00:18.416
<i>Ciri.</i> <i>Ciri...</i>

01:07.500 --> 01:08.916
-Dara?

01:20.458 --> 01:21.333
Please...

01:22.375 --> 01:23.208
don't hurt me.

01:23.291 --> 01:24.750
Keep your aim true.

01:26.666 --> 01:27.708
I'm lost.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.083
I don't know... how I got here.

01:38.916 --> 01:39.750
Please.

01:46.333 --> 01:49.166
If she runs, kill her.

01:54.333 --> 01:55.625
Where are you taking me?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.875
I need to find Dara. Please!

02:13.916 --> 02:15.458
What is your name?

02:17.625 --> 02:18.500
Fiona.

02:20.333 --> 02:23.583
-Where am I? How did I get--
-You are in Brokilon Forest.

02:25.208 --> 02:26.208
Follow me.

02:41.541 --> 02:42.708
I tell you no lie,

02:43.958 --> 02:46.041
it swallowed the whole village, it did.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.291
-Not a bone to be found!

02:49.541 --> 02:51.583
Oh, don't give me that look, shitling.

02:52.208 --> 02:54.125
That's why we had to call <i>him...</i>

02:55.541 --> 02:56.875
The White Wolf!

02:58.500 --> 03:01.458
And he stood in the middle
of that frozen lake

03:01.875 --> 03:04.083
like he knew it was coming for him.

03:05.875 --> 03:07.833
The ice cracked open

03:08.250 --> 03:10.083
and a selkiemore shot out!

03:10.166 --> 03:11.791
Oh, you've never seen one,

03:11.875 --> 03:14.458
but it'd take down a ship
with its cavernous mouth

03:14.875 --> 03:16.750
full of devil's teeth!

03:18.208 --> 03:20.750
And it... swallowed...

03:21.625 --> 03:22.750
that witcher...

03:23.166 --> 03:24.125
whole!

03:25.291 --> 03:28.500
Oh, this is brilliant!

03:29.833 --> 03:33.208
Oh, sorry. It's just Geralt's usually
so stingy with the details.

03:34.166 --> 03:35.333
Uh... and then what happened?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
He died.

03:40.250 --> 03:41.708
Eh... He's fine.

03:42.083 --> 03:44.083
Look, I was there.

03:44.166 --> 03:45.625
-I saw it with my own--

03:48.000 --> 03:49.250
-See?

03:52.708 --> 03:54.375
-Oh...

03:55.250 --> 03:56.375
What's that stench?

03:56.458 --> 03:58.041
-Selkiemore guts.
- Ugh!

03:58.958 --> 04:01.708
Had to get it from the inside.
I'll take what I'm owed.

04:01.791 --> 04:03.791
<i>♪ Toss a coin to your witcher</i> ♪

04:03.875 --> 04:05.583
<i>♪ O, Valley of Plenty ♪</i>

04:05.666 --> 04:07.166

04:07.250 --> 04:09.833

04:09.916 --> 04:14.875

-Yikes.

04:14.958 --> 04:16.666
-Thank you!

04:20.208 --> 04:21.500
You're welcome.

04:21.583 --> 04:24.708
And now, Witcher,
it's time to repay your debt.

04:25.916 --> 04:28.916
"What debt?" you're probably asking
yourself in your head right now.

04:29.000 --> 04:29.833
Well, I'll tell you.

04:29.916 --> 04:32.916
I've made you famous, Witcher.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.625
By rights, I should be claiming
ten percent of all your coin,

04:35.708 --> 04:38.875
but instead,
what I'm asking for is a teeny,

04:39.416 --> 04:40.666
teeny-weeny little favor.

04:40.750 --> 04:41.791
Fuck off, bard.

04:42.375 --> 04:44.250
For one measly night of service,

04:44.333 --> 04:48.000
you will gain a cornucopia
of earthly delights.

04:48.083 --> 04:50.083
The greatest masters
of the culinary arts

04:50.166 --> 04:52.583
crafting morsels worthy of the gods.

04:52.666 --> 04:55.875
Maidens
that would make the sun itself blush

04:55.958 --> 04:58.125
with a single comely smile.

04:58.208 --> 05:02.208
And rivers of the sweetest of drinks
from the rarest of--

05:02.291 --> 05:03.291
Fuck!

05:03.708 --> 05:05.166
Food, women and wine, Geralt!

05:11.333 --> 05:13.791
Now, now,
stop your boorish grunts of protest.

05:13.875 --> 05:17.000
It is one night bodyguarding your very
best friend in the whole wide world.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.166
How hard could it be?

05:19.708 --> 05:20.708
I'm not your friend.

05:21.250 --> 05:22.083
Oh. Oh, really?

05:22.166 --> 05:25.583
Oh, you usually just let strangers
rub chamomile onto your lovely bottom?

05:27.250 --> 05:29.750
Yeah, well, yeah, exactly.
That's what I thought.

05:30.500 --> 05:33.458
Every lord, knight
and twopenny king worth his salt

05:33.541 --> 05:34.875
will be at this betrothal.

05:35.458 --> 05:38.625
The Lioness of Cintra herself
will sing the praises

05:38.708 --> 05:41.166
of Jaskier's triumphant performance!

05:42.208 --> 05:43.791
How many of these lords want to kill you?

05:43.875 --> 05:46.375
Hard to say.
One stops keeping count after a while.

05:47.208 --> 05:49.708
Wives, concubines, mothers sometimes.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.250
Ooh, yeah, that face!

05:52.500 --> 05:53.333
Ooh!

05:54.000 --> 05:55.666
Scary face!

05:55.750 --> 05:57.708
No lord in his right mind will come close

05:57.791 --> 05:59.791
if you're standing next to me
with a puss like that.

05:59.875 --> 06:01.166
Ooh, on second thoughts...

06:01.500 --> 06:03.375
-might want to lay off the Cintran ale.

06:03.458 --> 06:04.916
A clear head would be best.

06:05.375 --> 06:06.916
I will not suffer tonight sober

06:07.000 --> 06:09.708
just because you hid your sausage
in the wrong royal pantry.

06:11.083 --> 06:14.125
I'm not killing anyone.
Not over the petty squabbles of men.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.208
Yes, yes, yes.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.125
You never get involved.
Except you actually do,

06:17.458 --> 06:18.583
all of the time.

06:20.708 --> 06:22.333
Ugh. Is this what happens
when you get old?

06:22.416 --> 06:25.166
You get unbearably crochety
and cantankerous?

06:25.750 --> 06:28.541
Actually, I've always wanted to know,
do witchers ever retire?

06:28.625 --> 06:31.125
Yeah. When they slow and get killed.

06:31.208 --> 06:33.333
Come on,
you must want something for yourself

06:33.416 --> 06:36.583
once all this...
monster hunting nonsense is over with.

06:36.666 --> 06:37.666
I want nothing.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.833
Well, who knows?

06:42.500 --> 06:44.625
Maybe someone out there will want you.

06:45.333 --> 06:46.166
I need no one.

06:47.166 --> 06:49.208
And the last thing I want is
someone needing me.

06:49.291 --> 06:50.125
And yet...

06:51.458 --> 06:52.500
here we are.

06:52.583 --> 06:53.416
Hm.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.666
Where the fuck are my clothes, Jaskier?

06:56.750 --> 07:00.208
Ah. Well, uh, they were sort of covered
in selkiemore guts,

07:00.291 --> 07:01.750
so I sent them away to be washed.

07:01.833 --> 07:05.458
Anyway, you're not going tonight
as a witcher.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.666
Right, so stick close to me, look mean
and pretend you're a mute.

07:15.750 --> 07:17.416
Can't have anyone finding out
who you are.

07:17.500 --> 07:21.125
Geralt of Rivia, the mighty Witcher!

07:21.208 --> 07:22.041
Oh, shit.

07:22.458 --> 07:24.333
I haven't seen you since the plague.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.708
Good times, Mousesack.

07:28.958 --> 07:31.583
I've missed your sour complexion.

07:31.666 --> 07:33.291
I feared this would be a dull affair,

07:33.375 --> 07:35.875
but now the White Wolf is here,
perhaps all is not lost.

07:37.125 --> 07:40.708
Why are you dressed
like a sad silk trader?

07:44.375 --> 07:45.791
- What?
-Walk with me.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.500
To Mousesack!

07:47.583 --> 07:48.958
- Yeah!
-To Mousesack!

07:50.791 --> 07:53.791
- Prince Windhalm of Attre!

07:53.875 --> 07:56.291
I've been advising the Skelligen crown
for years.

07:56.375 --> 07:59.750
A tad rough around the edges,
but they're of the earth. Like me.

07:59.833 --> 08:01.541
-Castellan Haxo.
-Old and crusty.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.916
How long
before this horse trading is done?

08:06.041 --> 08:07.625
I find royalty best taken in...

08:08.083 --> 08:09.166
small doses.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.583
I wouldn't count on leaving before dawn.

08:11.666 --> 08:15.291
These suitors will vie all night
for Princess Pavetta's hand.

08:15.375 --> 08:17.500
Marrying into this monarchy
is a mighty prize.

08:17.583 --> 08:21.041
Who wouldn't want to be king
of the most powerful force in the land?

08:21.416 --> 08:22.291
Hm.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.875
So, which one of these little shits
is your coin on?

08:30.333 --> 08:32.750
Come with me, there's much for you to see.

08:34.250 --> 08:35.708
It's not a fair bet.

08:35.791 --> 08:40.208
That red-headed scanderlout over there,
Crach an Craite, will marry Pavetta.

08:40.833 --> 08:43.958
The Lioness has already arranged it
with the boy's uncle,

08:44.041 --> 08:45.125
Eist Tuirseach.

08:46.208 --> 08:49.125
No one would dare make a move
on an alliance that powerful.

08:49.208 --> 08:50.250
Handy with a blade.

08:51.041 --> 08:53.250
-Handy with women, too.
-All an act.

08:53.333 --> 08:57.500
Queen Calanthe refused his proposal
three times after King Roegner died,

08:57.833 --> 09:00.458
despite the two of them
gliding around each other

09:00.541 --> 09:02.125
like courting swans.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.125
No, no, no.

09:04.875 --> 09:07.750
She was not for living
in her husband's shadow again.

09:10.916 --> 09:12.916
Something about you reminds me

09:13.000 --> 09:16.333
of a scoundrel I once saw
fleeing my wife's chambers!

09:16.416 --> 09:17.250
Um, well...

09:17.333 --> 09:18.875
-Drop your trousers.
-What?

09:18.958 --> 09:21.750
I didn't get a proper look
at the little shit's face,

09:21.833 --> 09:24.708
but that pimply arse
I'd remember anywhere.

09:24.791 --> 09:26.291
Well... uh, uh... Ah, Geralt.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.750
Forgive me, my lord.

09:29.833 --> 09:31.916
This... happens all the time.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.541
It's true, he has the face
of a cad and a coward.

09:34.625 --> 09:36.541
-Mm.
-But, truth be known,

09:37.458 --> 09:40.333
he was kicked in the balls by an ox
as a child.

09:40.416 --> 09:41.416
Well, that's...

09:42.125 --> 09:43.000
tr-- true.

09:43.958 --> 09:44.875
Apologies.

09:46.375 --> 09:47.625
Here, drown your...

09:48.041 --> 09:50.000
sorrows on me, eunuch.

09:53.666 --> 09:55.458
Oh, wow. Thank you. Thank you so much.

09:55.541 --> 09:57.250
First of all, you hog all the fanfare,

09:57.333 --> 09:58.958
then you go
and ruin my courtly reputation.

09:59.041 --> 10:01.958
I saved your life.
You're on your own from here on.

10:02.833 --> 10:05.000
Try not to get any daggers in your back
before dawn.

10:06.250 --> 10:09.041
All rise for
Her Majesty, the Lioness,

10:09.625 --> 10:11.875
Queen Calanthe of Cintra!

10:13.875 --> 10:14.875
Beer!

10:18.083 --> 10:19.583
Apologies, noble sirs.

10:20.125 --> 10:23.458
A few upstart townships in the south
needed reminding who was Queen.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.083
I find it's good
for one's blood and humors.

10:29.333 --> 10:32.250
Ready your suitor's tales of glory,
good lords.

10:32.958 --> 10:34.708
My daughter is eager
to have this over with.

10:35.375 --> 10:36.416
As am I.

10:36.791 --> 10:38.250
Bard, music!

10:41.750 --> 10:43.041
<i>♪ She</i> ♪

10:43.125 --> 10:45.458
No, no, no! A jig!

10:45.541 --> 10:47.875
You can save your bloody maudlin nonsense
for my funeral.

10:49.666 --> 10:50.500
Three, four...

10:55.750 --> 10:56.875
It will be done soon.

10:59.208 --> 11:00.875
You think I wanted to marry your father?

11:02.375 --> 11:04.333
I'll have none of your waterworks here.

11:04.416 --> 11:06.583
You're the daughter of the Lioness,
behave like it!

11:06.666 --> 11:09.625
Perhaps I should have some starving serfs
brought in to slaughter, then.

11:10.458 --> 11:11.750
Or I could decapitate some elves

11:11.833 --> 11:14.916
and have their heads hung about
as a lesson to those who would defy me.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.958
I will not have your hysteria
turn this night upside down.

11:19.541 --> 11:22.041
Besides, that boorish lout is the key

11:22.125 --> 11:25.208
to Cintra holding power
after I taste clay.

11:27.791 --> 11:28.916
He's from good stock.

11:30.583 --> 11:31.583
You could do worse.

11:31.666 --> 11:32.833
I could do better!

11:33.541 --> 11:35.291
You can have who you want
when you're married.

11:36.375 --> 11:39.166
You have your mother's blood.
You'll be fine.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.958
Where were you headed, Fiona,
to end up so lost?

11:53.625 --> 11:54.541
I was running...

11:55.166 --> 11:56.166
from the war.

11:58.333 --> 11:59.166
You...

12:00.416 --> 12:03.916
really don't remember
how you came to be in Brokilon Forest?

12:08.750 --> 12:10.500
Yet you heard it call to you.

12:12.416 --> 12:14.166
There were many forests like it...

12:14.875 --> 12:17.041
before the Conjunction of the Spheres.

12:19.416 --> 12:23.666
We adapted, fought off the mutants
and men who sought our end.

12:25.083 --> 12:26.500
Now only we remain.

12:28.416 --> 12:29.666
Dryads.

12:31.750 --> 12:32.750
Dara!

12:37.958 --> 12:39.208
I'm so glad you're alive!

12:40.083 --> 12:41.583
Is he going to be all right?

12:41.666 --> 12:43.166
Bite down on this.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.791
The waters of Brokilon are potent.

12:59.291 --> 13:02.291
All newcomers to the forest
must drink the waters.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.750
If they bear ill intent towards Brokilon,

13:07.125 --> 13:07.958
they die.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.750
If they're pure in heart, they survive...

13:12.708 --> 13:13.833
and may stay here.

13:14.958 --> 13:17.208
And over time, the waters of Brokilon

13:17.291 --> 13:20.666
will lessen the suffering
they have endured

13:21.375 --> 13:22.666
and make them forget.

13:23.125 --> 13:25.375
I think you'd like that. Am I right...

13:26.083 --> 13:26.958
Fiona?

13:28.958 --> 13:32.041
Because you're scared
of more than just war,

13:32.416 --> 13:33.291
aren't you?

13:34.833 --> 13:36.333
You will both drink the waters,

13:37.250 --> 13:38.625
and all will be revealed.

13:41.250 --> 13:44.125
You lie, you little shite!

13:44.208 --> 13:46.750
You've never faced so much
as a bad meal in your life,

13:46.833 --> 13:48.000
never mind a manticore.

13:48.083 --> 13:52.833
I've had manticores thrice as fat
and ugly as you perish under my steel!

13:52.916 --> 13:54.541
Under your bullshit, more like.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.833
-How many stings has it got, then?
-Two.

13:57.291 --> 13:58.875
Hah! Go away and shite!

13:58.958 --> 14:01.166
-It's five. I know.
-Your Majesty, that's Geralt of Rivia.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.291
I've actually killed one.

14:02.375 --> 14:03.666
-You--

14:03.750 --> 14:04.750
Enough!

14:06.500 --> 14:08.666
We have a renowned guest here tonight.

14:11.208 --> 14:14.750
Perhaps he can declare
which esteemed lord is telling the truth.

14:16.958 --> 14:17.833
Neither.

14:18.416 --> 14:20.750
Are you calling me a liar, old man?

14:20.833 --> 14:21.916
Aah!

14:22.000 --> 14:25.208
The Butcher of Blaviken
bleats utter nonsense.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.791
Perhaps the lords encountered...

14:34.958 --> 14:37.250
rare subspecies of manticore.

14:38.666 --> 14:39.541
Aye.

14:45.541 --> 14:48.541
Perhaps our esteemed guest would like
to entertain us

14:48.625 --> 14:51.208
with how he slayed the elves
at the edge of the world?

14:54.583 --> 14:55.916
There was no slaying.

14:56.833 --> 14:59.416
I had my arse kicked
by a ragged band of elves.

15:01.875 --> 15:03.750
I was about to have my throat cut

15:04.416 --> 15:06.000
when Filavandrel let me go.

15:08.166 --> 15:09.125
But the song!

15:09.208 --> 15:10.625
Yeah, the song.

15:11.125 --> 15:15.000
At least when Filavandrel's blade
kissed my throat, I didn't shit myself.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.375
Which is all I can hope for you,
good lords.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.083
At your final breath,

15:20.791 --> 15:22.208
a shitless death.

15:22.291 --> 15:23.916
Not going to shit meself...

15:24.000 --> 15:24.833
But I doubt it.

15:26.958 --> 15:29.458
It would have been your blade
at Filavandrel's throat

15:29.541 --> 15:30.875
had you been there, Your Majesty.

15:32.166 --> 15:35.583
Not that any elven bastard would crawl
from their lair to meet you on the field.

15:37.750 --> 15:41.375
Any man willing to paint himself
in the shadow of his failures

15:41.458 --> 15:44.375
will make for far more interesting
conversation this night.

15:45.708 --> 15:46.750
Come, Witcher.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.291
Take a seat by my side while I change.

15:52.041 --> 15:52.875
Hm.

16:02.666 --> 16:04.416
Why did she call you Fiona?

16:10.791 --> 16:13.333
Mousesack, he... helped raise me and...

16:14.458 --> 16:17.791
he warned me not to let anyone know
who I was outside the castle.

16:18.416 --> 16:21.000
-And now, the Black Knight is after me.
-Castle?

16:28.750 --> 16:30.625
I'm Princess Cirilla...

16:31.833 --> 16:33.458
-of Cintra.

16:34.916 --> 16:35.916
What's the matter?

16:37.458 --> 16:39.250
Your grandmother slaughtered my family!

16:39.958 --> 16:41.541
No, that's not true.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.625
She ordered it.

16:43.416 --> 16:45.916
-After Filavandrel's uprising--
-She wouldn't do that.

16:48.583 --> 16:49.583
Her soldiers...

16:50.833 --> 16:52.333
they laughed when they did it.

16:53.625 --> 16:55.375
Killing, raping...

16:57.125 --> 16:58.250
They laughed the hardest

16:58.333 --> 17:00.458
when they were swinging babies
from their legs,

17:00.750 --> 17:02.000
smashing their heads in.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.291
I was the only one left.

17:08.625 --> 17:09.625
Because I hid.

17:11.208 --> 17:12.375
I should've saved them.

17:14.125 --> 17:15.166
Or fought and died.

17:18.250 --> 17:19.125
Uh...

17:19.750 --> 17:22.125
-I don't know what to say.
-Say nothing.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.875
They're gone now.

17:25.791 --> 17:27.791
I would do anything to forget who I was.

17:29.083 --> 17:30.041
I can't.

17:31.041 --> 17:32.875
I have to find my destiny.

17:32.958 --> 17:35.458
Why? Because your grandmother said
you should?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.458
Maybe you should start thinking
for yourself.

17:41.833 --> 17:43.000
Because she is dead.

17:44.083 --> 17:45.125
And you are here.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.291
Damn this cursed thing.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.125
I'd as soon see this night out in armor.

17:59.791 --> 18:00.916
As would I.

18:01.375 --> 18:02.208
Indeed.

18:03.291 --> 18:06.583
Tell me, how does a witcher find himself
at my daughter's wedding feast

18:06.666 --> 18:08.416
dressed like a...

18:08.708 --> 18:11.625
I'm protecting the bard
from vengeful royal cuckolds.

18:11.708 --> 18:12.583
Hm!

18:12.666 --> 18:13.958
Idiots, the lot of them.

18:15.041 --> 18:18.250
Still, I'm glad of your company,
which could prove handy.

18:18.666 --> 18:20.833
I have no doubt
blood will spill here tonight.

18:20.916 --> 18:22.583
Ah, save the good Queen's breath.

18:23.875 --> 18:25.500
I'm not for hire as a bodyguard.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.208
You were hired just so by the bard.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.625
I'm helping the idiot free of his coin.

18:30.708 --> 18:32.583
And he's the idiot?

18:33.541 --> 18:36.875
I'm simply saying,
surely if all goes to hell here tonight,

18:36.958 --> 18:40.416
I can count on you
to strategically remove certain irritants

18:40.500 --> 18:41.958
that may present themselves?

18:43.708 --> 18:44.791
I'd do so myself,

18:44.875 --> 18:48.625
only I'm bound to uphold an artifice
of decorum and... fairness.

18:48.708 --> 18:49.541
Hey.

18:50.250 --> 18:51.333
I can't help you.

18:52.125 --> 18:54.250
So perilously direct.

18:55.583 --> 18:57.458
As Queen, I could command it.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.833
If I were one of your subjects.

18:59.916 --> 19:03.958
I could torture you so very slowly
into compliance.

19:04.041 --> 19:07.041
Her Majesty will do as she wishes.
I'm not for turning.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.541
Oh, come now.

19:08.875 --> 19:10.333
Everyone has their price.

19:11.541 --> 19:14.166
Lord Peregrine of Nilfgaard.

19:14.250 --> 19:15.583
Good chance, Peregrine, aah!

19:15.666 --> 19:17.000
Go on, Lord Peregrine!

19:28.791 --> 19:30.250
Make another sound, Draig Bon-Dhu,

19:30.333 --> 19:32.916
and I'll have your guts sewn into pipes
and sent to your mother.

19:34.291 --> 19:35.541
Queen Calanthe,

19:35.625 --> 19:39.750
my marriage to your daughter will unite
the jewels of the north and south,

19:39.833 --> 19:42.583
forging an unbreakable alliance
that none would dare cross.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.125
And...

19:44.208 --> 19:46.500
I am one of five brothers with no sisters.

19:46.916 --> 19:51.083
My potent seed inside Pavetta will produce
the strongest of male heirs.

19:56.208 --> 19:58.833
Cintra is indeed the jewel of the north,

19:59.625 --> 20:03.791
yet Nilfgaard remains the shit rag
of the south, and that's saying something!

20:06.708 --> 20:10.291
Tell me, is it true you drink piss water
and feast on your own young?

20:13.375 --> 20:16.208
Nilfgaardian kings don't remain kings
for long.

20:16.875 --> 20:19.333
Who will take the Usurper's crown? You?

20:19.416 --> 20:20.666
How long will you last?

20:20.750 --> 20:22.791
A year? A month? A day?

20:29.583 --> 20:31.708
Lord Steergart of Kaedwen.

20:45.208 --> 20:48.666
I know what they say,
"Poor Queen Kalis, another girl."

20:49.541 --> 20:51.916
-I mean, I'm just a womb to him.

20:52.500 --> 20:55.333
No more than a fleshy contraption
for squeezing out heirs.

20:55.416 --> 20:57.500
Bastard cares more about his hounds
than he does me.

21:00.458 --> 21:01.291
Take her.

21:03.208 --> 21:05.416
-Shh.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.750
Why don't you stay in Lyria?
Keep me company.

21:09.625 --> 21:12.208
As soon as I've delivered Your Majesty
safely back to court,

21:12.291 --> 21:13.791
I'm afraid I must return to Aedirn.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.333
I envy you. Truly.

21:18.916 --> 21:20.083
A king's mage.

21:20.791 --> 21:22.750
-How splendid!

21:22.833 --> 21:23.708
Oh!

21:30.250 --> 21:33.875
Oh, come, now. We've been traveling
together for days. Speak freely.

21:37.166 --> 21:38.541
I love...

21:38.625 --> 21:41.625
that I traded everything
to get my seat at court.

21:44.416 --> 21:46.416
I love that I believed
that it would all be worth it,

21:46.500 --> 21:47.833
that this would be my legacy.

21:48.333 --> 21:50.666
The greatest mage
to have ever graced a court.

21:53.916 --> 21:56.291
And I really, really love...

21:56.791 --> 21:59.625
that instead,
I've gotten to spend the last...

22:00.208 --> 22:01.791
three decades

22:01.875 --> 22:04.500
cleaning up stupid political messes.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.500
Glorified royal arse wiper.

22:15.541 --> 22:16.750
I have it far worse.

22:19.083 --> 22:23.333
People look at you for who you are,
not for what you can give them.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.708
You made the right choice,
giving all that nonsense up.

22:29.750 --> 22:32.375
To this baby, I am the whole world.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.500
If only it weren't so boring.

22:42.041 --> 22:43.583
Who is that--

23:39.583 --> 23:41.125
-Run!

23:48.958 --> 23:50.208
Go!

23:54.958 --> 23:56.875
-Run!

24:09.625 --> 24:11.333
I'll have that brigand's head on a pike

24:11.416 --> 24:13.458
outside the King's castle
before nightfall.

24:13.958 --> 24:14.875
How dare he?

24:14.958 --> 24:16.083
That was an assassin,

24:16.583 --> 24:17.583
not a brigand.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.333
What are you saying?

24:19.958 --> 24:21.291
He was paid to kill you.

24:22.666 --> 24:23.500
What?

24:24.708 --> 24:25.541
Why?

24:25.625 --> 24:29.250
It appears you've run out of chances
to provide your King a male heir.

24:30.750 --> 24:31.750
No, he wouldn't.

24:35.375 --> 24:36.833
-Oh, that prick!

24:37.750 --> 24:38.625
-Go!

24:46.500 --> 24:48.125
-Go!

25:03.000 --> 25:04.208
We're being tracked!

25:06.791 --> 25:09.958
Think! What did the King give you
that could be traced?

25:13.208 --> 25:14.208
-Come on!

25:30.791 --> 25:31.916
I can't hold it!

25:32.375 --> 25:33.833
Hurry!

25:55.083 --> 25:56.583
They're still tracking us.

26:05.166 --> 26:06.458
Get up, you useless witch.

26:07.958 --> 26:10.583
How could you not foresee this?
You were supposed to protect me.

26:30.250 --> 26:32.416
Oh, you horrible, useless bitch!

26:47.958 --> 26:50.250
<i>♪ Oh, fishmonger, oh, fishmonger</i> ♪

26:50.625 --> 26:55.000

27:16.250 --> 27:19.375
How much more of this peacocking
must I endure?

27:20.708 --> 27:21.625
This...

27:22.541 --> 27:25.500
All this
because male tradition demands it.

27:26.875 --> 27:28.000
If I were a man,

27:28.083 --> 27:30.125
I could simply tell the whole lot of them
to fuck off,

27:30.208 --> 27:32.958
declare outright who Pavetta should marry
and have done with it.

27:34.333 --> 27:36.833
Or, better yet,
let the poor girl decide her own fate.

27:38.708 --> 27:40.666
Something tells me
this isn't the first time

27:40.750 --> 27:43.416
you've navigated the vagaries
of male tradition.

27:44.375 --> 27:45.333
In fact,

27:47.375 --> 27:48.833
I'd wager you thrive on it.

27:48.916 --> 27:52.208
Spoken as one
who has navigated his own share of fools.

27:52.541 --> 27:53.416
Hm.

27:55.583 --> 27:56.625
Tell me, Witcher,

27:57.375 --> 27:59.208
why are there so few of you left?

28:03.625 --> 28:04.583
Hm.

28:09.375 --> 28:11.333
It is no longer possible
to create more of us,

28:11.416 --> 28:13.125
since the sacking of Kaer Morhen.

28:17.166 --> 28:18.291
Tell me, Your Majesty...

28:20.708 --> 28:22.375
why do you risk your life
on the battlefield

28:22.458 --> 28:24.166
when you can rest on your throne?

28:24.958 --> 28:29.416
Because there is a simplicity
in killing monsters, is there not?

28:31.083 --> 28:33.916
Seems we are quite the pair,
Geralt of Rivia.

28:35.708 --> 28:36.708
Hmm.

28:37.125 --> 28:38.291
Crach! It's time.

28:39.625 --> 28:41.250
Get your hairy ass up here.

28:47.458 --> 28:49.000
Forgive my late intrusion,
Your Majesty,

28:49.541 --> 28:51.541
and for the misunderstanding
with your guards.

28:51.625 --> 28:53.833
Please! I come in peace.

28:54.583 --> 28:56.541
I need but one moment of your time.

28:58.750 --> 29:01.291
I am Lord Urcheon of Erlenwald,

29:02.208 --> 29:04.583
and I have come to claim
your daughter's hand in marriage.

29:09.625 --> 29:10.625
A knight...

29:11.541 --> 29:12.875
of no renown...

29:13.916 --> 29:15.875
from a backwater hamlet...

29:16.625 --> 29:18.875
who dares to enter my court

29:18.958 --> 29:21.041
without revealing his face?

29:21.833 --> 29:23.541
I apologize, Your Majesty.

29:24.291 --> 29:27.333
A knight's oath prevents me
from revealing my face

29:27.416 --> 29:30.083
-until the sounding of the twelfth bell.
-Bollocks to that.

29:46.791 --> 29:47.666
Witcher...

29:48.958 --> 29:50.708
-kill it.
-No.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.708
-Whatever the price.
-This is no monster.

29:54.791 --> 29:56.083
I order you.

29:57.250 --> 29:59.291
This knight has been cursed.

29:59.791 --> 30:01.750
You're as useless as the rest of them.

30:02.416 --> 30:04.041
Slay this beast!

30:10.083 --> 30:11.208
Lioness of Cintra,

30:11.708 --> 30:14.125
I come to claim what is rightfully mine!

30:15.750 --> 30:16.833
Pavetta.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.708
By the Law of Surprise.

30:53.875 --> 30:55.000
-Oh...
-No!

31:05.666 --> 31:06.750
Kill them both!

31:24.458 --> 31:26.291
The Law of Surprise has been called.

31:27.625 --> 31:28.708
You kill them...

31:30.875 --> 31:31.833
kill me.

31:52.500 --> 31:53.500
My Queen...

32:06.916 --> 32:07.750
Stop!

32:09.958 --> 32:11.000
Stop!

32:20.416 --> 32:21.250
Please.

32:21.583 --> 32:23.583
-I can give him a boy.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.125
Take her instead.

32:45.583 --> 32:46.583
As a sacrifice.

34:29.000 --> 34:29.875
Duny!

34:31.750 --> 34:32.708
Oh!

34:35.500 --> 34:36.375
Oh.

34:40.583 --> 34:42.041
I told you to stay away.

35:07.875 --> 35:08.875
Your Majesty...

35:10.625 --> 35:12.500
the witcher speaks the truth.

35:14.041 --> 35:15.916
I was cursed as a young boy.

35:18.708 --> 35:21.083
My whole life a living misery

35:21.166 --> 35:25.250
until the day that I saved your husband,
King Roegner, from a certain death.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.333
By tradition,

35:28.250 --> 35:30.333
I chose the Law of Surprise as payment.

35:31.750 --> 35:34.083
Whatever windfall he came home to find...

35:35.250 --> 35:38.208
-would be mine.
-Oh, the stupid bastard.

35:38.833 --> 35:40.291
Better you had let him die!

35:40.375 --> 35:41.583
You knew he'd come,

35:42.583 --> 35:44.083
and you pushed me to kill him.

35:48.250 --> 35:49.125
And you...

35:50.166 --> 35:54.083
carousing with the beast
that swindled your stupid father!

35:54.166 --> 35:55.166
'Tis no swindle.

35:56.333 --> 35:58.166
Asking for payment
with the Law of Surprise

35:58.250 --> 35:59.708
is as old as mankind itself.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.166
-Don't lecture me, Eist.
-It's an honest gamble.

36:03.291 --> 36:06.375
As likely to be rewarded
with a bumper crop

36:06.458 --> 36:08.291
as a newborn pup.

36:08.375 --> 36:09.250
Or...

36:10.458 --> 36:11.833
a child of surprise.

36:13.458 --> 36:15.041
He could not know.

36:16.666 --> 36:20.250
Destiny has determined
the surprise be Pavetta.

36:20.750 --> 36:24.500
When I heard that King Roegner
had returned to find a child on the way...

36:25.541 --> 36:29.333
I abandoned all thought
of claiming the Law of Surprise.

36:30.583 --> 36:31.416
I knew...

36:34.416 --> 36:36.833
I knew no woman would ever accept me
like this.

36:39.833 --> 36:41.000
And so I waited.

36:42.708 --> 36:45.875
I waited until the twelfth bell
when the curse breaks.

36:47.166 --> 36:48.791
I never intended to meet her.

36:52.166 --> 36:53.541
Just to watch from afar.

36:54.750 --> 36:56.791
Until destiny intervened...

36:57.583 --> 36:59.208
and our hearts collided.

36:59.625 --> 37:02.541
And at dawn,
I awoke with her in my arms and me...

37:03.916 --> 37:04.791
like this.

37:07.666 --> 37:09.333
Who are we to challenge destiny?

37:09.916 --> 37:12.166
Life was saved, debt must be paid,

37:12.250 --> 37:14.291
or the whole order
of the world falls apart.

37:15.125 --> 37:16.708
Honor destiny's wish,

37:18.000 --> 37:21.291
or unleash its wrath upon us.

37:23.166 --> 37:24.916
There is no us!

37:26.291 --> 37:30.000
I bow to no law made by men
who never bore a child!

37:31.250 --> 37:36.541
Is there not a man amongst you
who does not cower before destiny?

37:39.750 --> 37:40.708
You, Witcher...

37:42.208 --> 37:44.958
who has known monsters
of every fang and claw...

37:46.833 --> 37:48.041
are you afraid too?

37:49.875 --> 37:50.916
No.

37:52.708 --> 37:56.083
I've seen mothers lash themselves raw
over the death of a child,

37:56.708 --> 37:58.958
believing they crossed destiny,

37:59.041 --> 38:00.291
ignoring the stench

38:00.375 --> 38:04.083
of the 50 other children
in the plague cart outside.

38:06.083 --> 38:07.000
Destiny...

38:07.833 --> 38:10.708
helps people believe there's an order
to this horseshit.

38:11.916 --> 38:12.750
There isn't.

38:15.333 --> 38:17.250
But a promise made must be honored.

38:19.708 --> 38:21.083
As true for a commoner...

38:22.166 --> 38:23.416
as it is for a queen.

38:33.250 --> 38:35.500
I love Duny, Mother.

38:37.708 --> 38:39.000
I will marry him.

38:42.458 --> 38:44.708
I will finally be free.

39:41.625 --> 39:43.250
Here is your destiny.

39:51.791 --> 39:55.666
No!

40:09.375 --> 40:11.541
My Queen, are you hurt?

43:14.708 --> 43:16.750
Do you believe in destiny now?

44:17.083 --> 44:19.875
I thought
your grandmother's gift had skipped you...

44:20.791 --> 44:22.000
as it did me.

44:25.458 --> 44:26.791
It seems I was wrong.

44:29.416 --> 44:31.041
About so many things.

44:36.333 --> 44:37.958
Destiny has spoken!

44:40.125 --> 44:41.291
And I have listened.

44:44.666 --> 44:47.291
The Law of Surprise will be honored.

44:52.208 --> 44:53.750
Pavetta will marry...

44:54.500 --> 44:55.583
Lord Urcheon.

44:58.708 --> 44:59.708
React poorly,

45:00.291 --> 45:02.333
and you won't just face the Lioness,

45:02.416 --> 45:04.750
you will be facing
the sea hounds of Skellige.

45:06.500 --> 45:08.041
Because Queen Calanthe...

45:08.666 --> 45:10.916
has agreed to my proposal of marriage.

45:22.916 --> 45:25.041
There will be two vows here tonight!

45:26.958 --> 45:28.500
I assume that's agreeable.

45:33.125 --> 45:34.125
Delightful.

45:35.250 --> 45:39.416
No!

46:25.291 --> 46:26.125
Dara?

46:33.000 --> 46:33.833
Dara?

46:40.625 --> 46:41.750
I drank the waters.

46:43.125 --> 46:44.083
It's gonna be okay.

46:46.500 --> 46:47.791
What's going to be okay?

46:49.291 --> 46:50.125
Everything.

47:04.625 --> 47:06.208
Leave your past behind.

47:06.625 --> 47:07.708
Join us.

47:07.791 --> 47:09.458
Drink and forget.

47:32.625 --> 47:33.666
Why isn't it working?

47:37.208 --> 47:38.041
Come.

47:40.041 --> 47:42.208
Shan-Kayan calls to you.

47:54.708 --> 47:56.291
Which one of us are you here for?

48:04.041 --> 48:05.666
I'm sorry you didn't have a life.

48:07.208 --> 48:08.958
But if truth be told,
you're not missing much.

48:12.125 --> 48:14.958
I know it's easy for me to say
with warm breath in my lungs,

48:15.041 --> 48:16.166
and you with nothing.

48:20.708 --> 48:23.666
Still... what would you have had?

48:25.166 --> 48:26.000
Parents?

48:28.416 --> 48:30.750
Well, they're the ones
who wrote your last act,

48:30.833 --> 48:32.083
so not much lost there.

48:34.500 --> 48:35.375
Friends?

48:36.166 --> 48:37.541
Most likely fair weather.

48:39.625 --> 48:40.541
Lovers?

48:42.166 --> 48:45.666
Fun for a bit, I'll admit,
but all eventually disappoint.

48:48.791 --> 48:50.083
And let's face it,

48:50.625 --> 48:51.625
you're a girl.

48:53.791 --> 48:55.708
Your mother was right about one thing.

48:56.958 --> 48:58.250
We're just vessels.

49:00.541 --> 49:02.541
And even when we're told we're special,

49:03.791 --> 49:04.791
as I was,

49:07.583 --> 49:08.708
as you would've been,

49:10.875 --> 49:12.500
we're still just vessels...

49:14.250 --> 49:15.625
for them to take...

49:16.166 --> 49:17.250
and take...

49:19.250 --> 49:20.458
until we're empty...

49:22.375 --> 49:23.375
and alone.

49:35.500 --> 49:36.750
So, count yourself lucky.

49:38.166 --> 49:40.958
You've cheated the game and won
without even knowing it.

49:56.958 --> 49:58.041
Sleep well.

50:38.625 --> 50:39.458
Pavetta.

50:43.958 --> 50:44.791
Duny.

50:47.416 --> 50:48.375
With my blessing...

50:51.250 --> 50:52.291
I thee bind.

51:57.791 --> 51:59.500
The twelfth bell has not yet rung.

51:59.583 --> 52:00.583
What has happened?

52:00.666 --> 52:03.000
I think your blessing of this marriage...

52:04.083 --> 52:05.916
has fulfilled a destiny.

52:07.916 --> 52:09.125
The curse has been lifted.

52:16.416 --> 52:17.750
Whew!

52:17.833 --> 52:20.500
I think this has the makings
of my greatest ballad yet.

52:20.583 --> 52:22.666
If you're alive in the morning. Don't...

52:23.958 --> 52:26.125
grope for trout in any peculiar rivers
until dawn.

52:27.375 --> 52:28.708
No, wait! Wait.

52:31.291 --> 52:32.291
You saved my life.

52:33.250 --> 52:34.208
I must repay you.

52:34.750 --> 52:37.291
You've proven yourself to be
the kind of man who would do the same.

52:38.166 --> 52:39.750
-I want nothing.
-No, please.

52:41.375 --> 52:44.958
Please, Geralt of Rivia, do not feel
like you're doing me a service.

52:46.583 --> 52:49.625
I cannot start a new life
in the shadow of a life debt.

52:50.791 --> 52:51.625
Fine.

52:52.583 --> 52:53.791
I...

52:55.041 --> 52:56.666
claim the tradition as you have,

52:57.000 --> 52:57.958
the Law of Surprise.

52:58.958 --> 53:01.416
Give me that which you already have
but do not know.

53:01.500 --> 53:02.333
No!

53:04.833 --> 53:06.291
What have you done, Witcher?

53:06.375 --> 53:07.625
Fear not, Your Majesty,

53:07.958 --> 53:10.708
if I am seen in your kingdom again,
it'll be to kill a real monster,

53:11.166 --> 53:13.708
not lay claim to a crop or a new pup.

53:14.250 --> 53:15.708
Destiny can go fu--

53:19.750 --> 53:20.666
Pavetta?

53:23.000 --> 53:23.958
Are you...

53:25.625 --> 53:26.458
Oh...

53:32.833 --> 53:33.708
Fuck.

53:44.750 --> 53:47.333
Clearly the girl has access
to immense primal power.

53:47.916 --> 53:50.583
Yeah, and with no idea how to control it.

53:52.833 --> 53:53.833
I'm gonna stay.

53:54.791 --> 53:55.625
Guide her.

53:58.083 --> 54:00.875
-You're a good man, Mousesack.
-You should stay too.

54:03.083 --> 54:04.958
This has been enough partying for me.

54:05.458 --> 54:06.666
I'm getting out of here.

54:07.291 --> 54:08.125
Alone.

54:09.916 --> 54:11.583
You're bound to this now, Geralt.

54:12.375 --> 54:13.750
Whether you like it or not.

54:13.833 --> 54:15.500
I'm not for changing.

54:16.500 --> 54:17.875
You know me better than that.

54:17.958 --> 54:22.291
Yes, I do, but you can't outrun destiny
just because you're terrified of it.

54:22.375 --> 54:24.250
It's coming, Geralt.

54:25.916 --> 54:27.375
Not believing won't change that.

54:27.458 --> 54:28.333
Bullshit.

54:29.500 --> 54:33.458
This was just a girl using her magic
to stop her mother from gutting her lover.

54:34.541 --> 54:36.500
-Nothing more.
-So you say.

54:37.375 --> 54:40.625
But the bond that will come into being
between you

54:41.083 --> 54:42.458
and this child...

54:43.875 --> 54:46.625
when it is born, will be extraordinary.

54:48.291 --> 54:50.958
If you dismiss it,
leave without claiming this...

54:51.500 --> 54:52.791
child surprise,

54:54.166 --> 54:59.166
you will surely unleash true calamity
upon us all.

55:01.125 --> 55:02.291
I'll take that chance.

55:05.708 --> 55:06.708
Mind yourself.

55:08.583 --> 55:11.166
True words are rare birds
in courts like this.

55:12.958 --> 55:14.583
Watch for daggers in your back.

55:16.083 --> 55:17.500
Or, more likely, poison.

55:23.208 --> 55:24.833
Be careful, old friend.

56:13.083 --> 56:14.250
Queen Calanthe.

56:17.083 --> 56:18.958
Mistress, I've found her!

57:01.333 --> 57:02.500
Is it working?

57:05.708 --> 57:08.333
Calanthe's progeny is in Brokilon Forest.

57:08.791 --> 57:11.333
We can spare ten thousand men
to take it, sir.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.625
-Maybe 12.
-Shut up!

57:14.916 --> 57:17.375
Armies are not the way
into Brokilon Forest.

57:19.625 --> 57:20.458
Damn it!

57:31.416 --> 57:33.250
-Come on, get moving!

58:12.833 --> 58:14.625
You must drink from the source.

59:23.875 --> 59:26.166
What are you, child?
