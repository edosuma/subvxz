00:05.271 --> 00:07.204
WALTER:
<i> I'm Walter O'Brien.</i>

00:07.205 --> 00:09.138
<i> I run a team of geniuses</i>
<i> who handle worldwide threats</i>

00:09.141 --> 00:11.107
<i> only we can solve.</i>

00:11.109 --> 00:14.110
<i> Sylvester is</i>
<i> a human calculator.</i>

00:14.112 --> 00:15.277
<i> Happy's a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:15.279 --> 00:18.013
<i> And Toby is our behaviorist.</i>

00:18.015 --> 00:20.281
<i> Agent Cabe Gallo</i>
<i> is our government handler.</i>

00:20.283 --> 00:22.449
<i> And Paige helps translates</i>
<i> the world for us</i>

00:22.451 --> 00:25.185
<i> while we help her understand</i>
<i> her genius son.</i>

00:25.187 --> 00:26.419
<i> Though sometimes</i>
<i> our biggest challenge</i>

00:26.421 --> 00:28.287
<i> is understanding each other.</i>

00:28.289 --> 00:30.188
<i> Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

00:31.157 --> 00:33.157
(tires screeching)

00:33.159 --> 00:36.426
(siren wailing)

00:36.428 --> 00:38.194
(engine revving)

00:42.533 --> 00:45.200
(tires screeching)

00:45.202 --> 00:48.703
(siren wailing)

00:48.705 --> 00:50.237
(tires screeching)

00:51.340 --> 00:52.923
(gunshot)

00:52.924 --> 00:54.507
You take the back,
I'll take the front.

00:54.509 --> 00:55.674
Cut! Cut, cut, cut,
cut. Cut!

00:55.676 --> 00:56.808
Huh?

00:56.810 --> 00:58.476
What's the holdup?

00:58.478 --> 01:00.678
What's the matter?
Uh, tech advisor has a note.

01:00.680 --> 01:02.179
The tech advisor, yeah?

01:02.181 --> 01:04.681
You're holding the gun wrong.
(laughs)

01:04.683 --> 01:06.349
I'm holding the gun wrong.

01:06.351 --> 01:08.317
Listen, I've done a few
cop projects in my time.

01:08.319 --> 01:09.985
I know what I'm talking...

01:09.986 --> 01:11.652
Yeah, well, that sounds fun and
all make-believe, Mr. Simmons,

01:11.655 --> 01:13.354
but you're not on stage
wearing makeup.

01:13.356 --> 01:14.906
You want to look genuine,
in the real world,

01:14.907 --> 01:16.457
you hold a gun like this.
Why don't you do me a favor?

01:16.459 --> 01:18.659
Go to craft services,
grab a Sanka.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.127
(phone ringing)

01:20.129 --> 01:21.261
(mumbling)

01:21.263 --> 01:22.662
Have a nice day.
Gallo.

01:22.664 --> 01:25.064
MAN: Mr. Gallo, I'm calling
from Homeland Security.

01:25.066 --> 01:26.532
The director wants
you and team Scorpion

01:26.534 --> 01:28.667
to assemble at the garage
in 45 minutes.

01:28.669 --> 01:30.068
Hold on, we got a case?

01:30.070 --> 01:31.169
I got my job back?

01:31.171 --> 01:33.704
The answer to both questions
is yes.

01:35.841 --> 01:38.174
Do you want me to call my agent?
No, no, no!

01:38.176 --> 01:39.675
Hold this for me,
would you, Gene?

01:39.677 --> 01:43.278
Wardrobe, I need a suit!

01:47.317 --> 01:48.649
Good job.
Making progress.

01:48.651 --> 01:50.217
Uh, how about you get
the pick-up sticks?

01:50.219 --> 01:51.318
Yeah, sure.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.320
Fantastic.

01:53.322 --> 01:55.755
More pick-up sticks...

01:55.757 --> 01:59.191
(tone ringing)

01:59.193 --> 02:01.359
(low whooshing)

02:01.361 --> 02:02.660
(distantly):
Hey, Walt.

02:04.563 --> 02:05.628
Oh, hey.

02:05.630 --> 02:07.196
Okay, uh, how about we start

02:07.198 --> 02:08.397
with some "Chopsticks" today?

02:08.399 --> 02:09.664
MAN:
You got it, boss.

02:11.367 --> 02:14.434
(playing "Chopsticks")

02:18.339 --> 02:22.206
(playing classical music
masterfully)

02:23.209 --> 02:25.642
(laughing)

02:25.644 --> 02:28.378
We've talked about you
rewiring the prosthetics.

02:28.380 --> 02:30.179
(laughing):
I'm sorry, I just...

02:30.181 --> 02:32.748
we couldn't, we couldn't
take more "Chopsticks."

02:32.750 --> 02:34.216
That's a six-figure robotic arm.

02:34.218 --> 02:35.550
CABE:
You're wasting your time.

02:35.552 --> 02:37.385
He doesn't listen to anybody.

02:37.387 --> 02:39.420
You're here early this week.

02:39.422 --> 02:40.454
And no puzzles?

02:40.456 --> 02:41.855
It ain't a visit, son.

02:41.857 --> 02:43.456
I've been reinstated.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.124
And we got a case.

02:45.126 --> 02:47.326
Well, that's fantastic that
Merrick gave you your job back.

02:47.328 --> 02:49.561
That must mean the case is dire.

02:49.563 --> 02:51.262
You up for working?

02:51.264 --> 02:53.197
I know you got a few
more weeks of therapy.

02:53.199 --> 02:54.331
Oh, no, no, no.
Hand's coming along.

02:54.333 --> 02:56.266
Just let me go
tell the therapist.

02:58.236 --> 02:59.301
Hey, so I've been called

02:59.303 --> 03:01.403
to a brief consult.

03:01.405 --> 03:02.804
Well, the doctor doesn't
advise any day trips

03:02.806 --> 03:04.172
for another two
weeks, at least.

03:04.174 --> 03:05.273
I feel, I feel fine.

03:05.275 --> 03:06.340
When was your last dizzy spell?

03:06.342 --> 03:08.459
Can't even remember.

03:08.460 --> 03:10.577
All right, well, you need
to avoid stress at all costs.

03:10.579 --> 03:12.245
This isn't a joke,
Mr. O'Brien.

03:12.247 --> 03:14.380
I'm a tech geek.
(chuckles)

03:14.382 --> 03:16.682
How stressful could it be?

03:16.684 --> 03:18.450
PAIGE:
<i> Okay, one Tuna Paradise,</i>

03:18.451 --> 03:20.217
a Turkey Gobbler and a Pot Pie Surprise.
MAN (bell dinging): Paige!

03:20.220 --> 03:21.586
We're going cold
over here!

03:21.588 --> 03:23.621
In a second. MAN: I
wanted the tuna salad,

03:23.623 --> 03:26.223
not a sandwich.
Paige, some time today!

03:26.225 --> 03:27.390
Nemos, in a second, please.

03:27.392 --> 03:28.924
The Tuna Paradise is a sandwich.

03:28.926 --> 03:30.492
The Tuna Paramour is a salad.

03:30.494 --> 03:31.860
Paige, either you can do the job
or you can't!

03:31.862 --> 03:34.195
Nemos, for the love of God...
Oh, my God!

03:36.299 --> 03:38.365
TOBY:
Sleeping on the job.

03:38.367 --> 03:39.866
That's what you've been doing
these past weeks?

03:39.868 --> 03:41.834
(groans) What are you guys
doing back?

03:41.836 --> 03:43.402
Walter isn't finished
with his PT.

03:43.404 --> 03:44.936
HAPPY:
Got a text from Cabe.

03:44.938 --> 03:47.305
Cabe doesn't work here anymore.
Why didn't I get a text?

03:47.307 --> 03:49.473
SYLVESTER: Cabe got rehired.
And you did get a text.

03:49.475 --> 03:51.174
And what the heck's
a Tuna Paramour?

03:51.176 --> 03:52.642
TOBY: Aw, I see you
got a new toy.

03:52.644 --> 03:55.244
Not a toy--
a vintage Super Fun Guy

03:55.246 --> 03:57.446
talking statuette
with variable dialogue chip.

03:57.448 --> 03:59.781
I've turned my focus now
to more serious

03:59.783 --> 04:01.449
collectors' pieces.

04:01.451 --> 04:03.417
I spent my time off
trying to evolve a little.

04:03.419 --> 04:05.252
You'll take a lickin'

04:05.254 --> 04:06.419
from my rubber chicken!

04:06.421 --> 04:07.953
(blows landing)

04:07.955 --> 04:10.588
I'm sure you
were hugely productive.

04:10.590 --> 04:13.757
I spent my time outdoors,
applying my behaviorist skills

04:13.759 --> 04:14.824
to the animal kingdom.

04:14.826 --> 04:16.392
Not collecting toys!

04:16.394 --> 04:18.394
Or making them.

04:18.396 --> 04:20.229
It was a toy, now it's a weapon.

04:20.231 --> 04:21.430
TOBY:
Very mature.

04:21.432 --> 04:22.898
Warfare, sprinkled
with arts and crafts.

04:23.867 --> 04:25.333
(screams)

04:25.335 --> 04:26.434
Ow!

04:26.436 --> 04:27.868
I like paintball!

04:27.870 --> 04:30.303
SYLVESTER:
Well, at least one of us

04:30.305 --> 04:31.637
didn't completely regress
without Scorpion.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.739
Looks like Paige has
spent her summer reading.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.340
Nerd.

04:35.342 --> 04:36.774
Actually, while Walter rehabbed,

04:36.776 --> 04:38.542
he asked me to take charge
of the day-to-day

04:38.544 --> 04:39.943
in a more meaningful way--
you guys handle the science,

04:39.945 --> 04:41.277
I handle the business.

04:41.279 --> 04:42.611
"Leadership Dynamics"?

04:42.613 --> 04:45.347
"Managing Strategic
Relationships."

04:45.349 --> 04:46.614
"The Entrepreneur Mind."

04:46.616 --> 04:47.881
I've installed
energy-efficient lightbulbs

04:47.883 --> 04:50.250
and a new intercom system

04:50.252 --> 04:51.501
so we don't have to shout.
Boring!

04:51.502 --> 04:52.751
Want to hear what the
new case is already.

04:52.754 --> 04:54.453
So do we.

04:54.455 --> 04:56.288
But we're still
waiting for contact

04:56.290 --> 04:57.389
from Homeland.

04:57.391 --> 04:58.456
Hey, welcome back, Kotter!

04:58.458 --> 04:59.523
Who?

05:00.359 --> 05:01.458
(grunts)

05:01.460 --> 05:02.692
I missed you.

05:02.694 --> 05:04.393
Yeah, reciprocated.

05:04.395 --> 05:06.328
I could've made you
something better.

05:06.330 --> 05:07.762
(chuckles)

05:07.764 --> 05:09.363
How come you only
let Cabe visit?

05:09.365 --> 05:10.964
Our leader didn't want us to see
him in a weakened state.

05:10.966 --> 05:12.465
Classic Hercules Complex.

05:12.467 --> 05:16.368
Yeah, well, the point is
that I'm... back and

05:16.370 --> 05:18.370
I'm sure that we're all...

05:18.372 --> 05:19.704
pleased... pleased
to return to work.

05:19.706 --> 05:21.439
So...

05:21.441 --> 05:23.374
Speaking of which, Director
Merrick should be here

05:23.376 --> 05:24.742
any minute.
Oh, thrilling!

05:24.744 --> 05:25.876
Good to have you back.

05:25.878 --> 05:27.410
It's been quiet around here.

05:27.412 --> 05:28.878
(robotic blasting)

05:28.880 --> 05:29.912
SUPER FUN GUY:
My Whoopee Cushion of Doom

05:29.914 --> 05:31.781
will blast you to atoms!

05:31.782 --> 05:33.649
(Super Fun Guy farting)
You were saying?

05:33.651 --> 05:35.784
I, uh,
I enjoyed the cupcakes

05:35.786 --> 05:37.285
that you-you sent me.

05:37.287 --> 05:38.552
They were...

05:38.554 --> 05:39.853
moist.

05:39.855 --> 05:41.988
Least I could do.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.892
I should really get changed.

05:51.598 --> 05:53.030
I don't like that
ergonomic chair you got me.

05:53.032 --> 05:54.431
My old chair had

05:54.433 --> 05:57.267
a perfectly worn butt groove.

05:57.269 --> 05:59.435
Is nothing sacred?

05:59.437 --> 06:00.803
(knocks)
Hey.

06:00.805 --> 06:01.870
Oh, hey.
Yeah, come in.

06:01.872 --> 06:03.872
Oh, I just need a second,

06:03.874 --> 06:04.973
if that's okay.
Sure.

06:04.975 --> 06:06.291
Um...

06:06.292 --> 06:07.608
uh, here, let me,
let me help you.

06:07.610 --> 06:09.409
Oh, thank you. Yeah.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.778
Oh, I saw the, uh,
books on your desk.

06:11.780 --> 06:14.580
You've really, uh, embraced
the added responsibility

06:14.582 --> 06:15.881
that I've, I've given you. Yes.

06:15.883 --> 06:17.916
Uh, the, um, the one constant

06:17.918 --> 06:19.951
I found in all of those books
is without open communication,

06:19.953 --> 06:22.920
ventures invariably fail.
Mm-hmm.

06:22.922 --> 06:24.488
So the team has to be able
to share ideas

06:24.490 --> 06:25.956
and concerns and feelings
Mm-hmm.

06:25.958 --> 06:29.559
without... judgment or...

06:29.561 --> 06:31.027
repercussion.

06:31.029 --> 06:32.461
There, it's done.

06:32.463 --> 06:33.995
Right, yeah.

06:33.997 --> 06:36.030
Unadulterated information flow

06:36.032 --> 06:37.931
is always optimal.

06:37.933 --> 06:40.033
Good, uh, because...

06:40.035 --> 06:42.735
I have some information
to, um...

06:42.737 --> 06:43.902
flow.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.770
Uh-huh.
It seems when you were back

06:45.772 --> 06:47.037
at the hospital unconscious,

06:47.039 --> 06:50.840
I... well, I sort of...

06:50.842 --> 06:52.441
kissed you.

06:52.443 --> 06:54.910
I've had time
to think about why,

06:54.912 --> 06:56.878
and I've realized that you've
helped me and Ralph a great deal.

06:56.880 --> 06:58.813
Ralph! How is, uh,
how is he doing? Is he...?

06:58.815 --> 06:59.880
In Maine, visiting Drew.

06:59.882 --> 07:01.081
But I really need
to stay on topic

07:01.083 --> 07:02.015
or we'll never get through this.
Okay, sorry.

07:02.017 --> 07:03.049
It's okay. Okay.

07:03.051 --> 07:04.984
So, um, this job puts us

07:04.986 --> 07:07.553
in intense situations,
emotions run high.

07:07.555 --> 07:10.055
And I really respect you and
like you so much as a person.

07:10.057 --> 07:11.623
And I think
that those feelings

07:11.625 --> 07:12.924
got tangled up and confused

07:12.926 --> 07:14.892
(laughs):
and so, I-I... I kissed you.

07:14.894 --> 07:16.894
(clears throat) You know, I think
it's important there be no secrets.

07:16.896 --> 07:17.961
Open communication.

07:17.963 --> 07:19.395
Right, and I know

07:19.397 --> 07:21.497
I don't really
have those feelings

07:21.499 --> 07:22.715
I may have thought I had

07:22.716 --> 07:23.932
and I don't want to risk
Scorpion in any way.

07:23.934 --> 07:25.517
So I know I'm rambling,
so I'll conclude

07:25.518 --> 07:27.101
by saying I think
we should move forward

07:27.103 --> 07:28.936
as professional colleagues
because that's what we are.

07:28.938 --> 07:30.871
Yeah, I mean,

07:30.873 --> 07:32.505
I-I-I appreciate your honesty

07:32.507 --> 07:33.739
and I agree

07:33.741 --> 07:35.040
that what we experienced

07:35.042 --> 07:36.808
was just a...

07:36.810 --> 07:38.876
uh, you know,
a stressful first year

07:38.878 --> 07:40.510
(laughs):
on the job.

07:40.512 --> 07:42.044
Good, um...

07:42.046 --> 07:43.745
And since we're following

07:43.747 --> 07:46.047
the open communication doctrine,
is there...

07:46.049 --> 07:49.350
anything you'd like to share?

07:49.352 --> 07:51.552
Uh... no.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.086
Oh.

07:53.088 --> 07:55.021
Okay.

07:55.023 --> 07:58.057
Well, I think this
was a productive talk.

07:58.059 --> 07:59.725
Yeah, me, too.

07:59.727 --> 08:00.826
(intercom buzzes)

08:00.828 --> 08:01.960
TOBY:
Me, too.

08:01.962 --> 08:04.127
New intercom works great
by the way.

08:06.998 --> 08:08.964
Eavesdropping is
a crime, you know?

08:08.966 --> 08:11.967
Says the woman who assaulted
an unconscious man.

08:11.969 --> 08:13.702
Felony much?

08:13.704 --> 08:15.003
I'm very uncomfortable
right now.

08:15.005 --> 08:16.738
I'm with you--
no fraternization

08:16.740 --> 08:18.072
means no problems.

08:18.074 --> 08:19.973
I'm right here.

08:19.975 --> 08:23.109
SYLVESTER:
An SUV just pulled up!

08:23.111 --> 08:24.376
Has, uh, Director Merrick
arrived?

08:24.378 --> 08:25.744
Not exactly.

08:25.746 --> 08:27.779
What does that mean?

08:34.753 --> 08:37.153
Director Merrick,
you look ravishing.

08:37.155 --> 08:39.054
This is Adriana Molina,

08:39.056 --> 08:40.722
new Homeland director.

08:40.724 --> 08:42.924
What happened
to Bald 'N Grumpy?

08:42.926 --> 08:44.158
Well, let's just say you guys
weren't the only ones

08:44.160 --> 08:45.659
that Merrick couldn't
get along with.

08:45.661 --> 08:47.060
Adriana?

08:47.062 --> 08:48.628
I'd tell you about myself,

08:48.630 --> 08:50.563
but I'm sure you'll have
my records soon enough.

08:50.565 --> 08:52.331
SYLVESTER: Top of class
Yale, Georgetown Law,

08:52.332 --> 08:54.098
Deputy Secretary to the U.N.
Human Rights Council,

08:54.101 --> 08:56.101
Director
of International Affairs...

08:56.103 --> 08:57.102
For another day,

08:57.104 --> 08:59.037
Mr. Dodd.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.805
In my hand is a jump drive.

09:00.807 --> 09:03.107
You'll download the details
to our next case

09:03.109 --> 09:04.675
while in transit to RAC.

09:04.677 --> 09:06.109
Rocketry Aeronautics Center.

09:06.111 --> 09:07.176
Yes.

09:07.178 --> 09:08.644
Your team is uniquely qualified

09:08.646 --> 09:10.846
because as reacquired
government assets,

09:10.848 --> 09:12.514
you can be held
to strict confidentiality,

09:12.516 --> 09:14.082
whereas private RAC
contractors cannot.

09:14.084 --> 09:16.017
Further,

09:16.019 --> 09:18.185
you have intimate knowledge of
Russian aerospace engineering.

09:18.187 --> 09:19.619
No, we don't.

09:19.621 --> 09:20.853
I am looking directly at

09:20.855 --> 09:22.054
an illegally obtained

09:22.056 --> 09:24.122
Cold War-era rocket.

09:25.125 --> 09:26.691
Oh, that thing.

09:26.693 --> 09:27.958
Now, in the past year,

09:27.960 --> 09:30.060
you have managed
to piss off the LAPD,

09:30.062 --> 09:31.828
ATF, CIA,

09:31.830 --> 09:33.529
FBI...
NBA.

09:34.565 --> 09:37.198
Snuck into a Clippers game.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.766
Seems Merrick
was hoping you guys

09:38.768 --> 09:39.967
would screw up enough
that the government

09:39.969 --> 09:41.535
would never trust you again.

09:41.537 --> 09:42.969
I am not Merrick.

09:42.971 --> 09:45.071
I want you to be successful.

09:45.073 --> 09:47.873
Now, debriefing begins
in the SUV, 30 seconds.

09:51.478 --> 09:52.910
Let's move.

09:52.912 --> 09:55.779
ADRIANA:
<i> The Russian K12 satellite</i>

09:55.781 --> 09:57.680
a few hours ago
was struck by space debris,

09:57.682 --> 09:59.982
knocked out of orbit and now
it is hurtling towards Earth.

09:59.984 --> 10:01.417
Rough estimates have it

10:01.418 --> 10:02.851
hit somewhere
in Southern California.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.336
Spent the last two months
at Santa Anita.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.820
Didn't hit one exacta,
these odds come in.

10:05.822 --> 10:07.855
Handicapping ponies--
that was you

10:07.857 --> 10:09.489
using your skills
on the animal kingdom?

10:09.491 --> 10:11.924
Satellites fall
out of orbit every day.

10:11.926 --> 10:14.126
Why-why wouldn't this one
burn up on re-entry?

10:14.128 --> 10:15.560
It's nuclear powered

10:15.562 --> 10:16.961
by a thousand-pound
block of plutonium

10:16.963 --> 10:18.095
encased in beryllium.

10:18.097 --> 10:19.896
So if it hits the Earth
at say, Mach 30?

10:19.898 --> 10:20.830
We've got an A-bomb.

10:20.832 --> 10:23.032
Destruction radius: 50 miles.

10:23.034 --> 10:24.900
HAPPY: That impact
will create a fireball

10:24.902 --> 10:26.768
and incinerate everything
within five miles.

10:26.770 --> 10:28.836
Then a concussive
air blast will level

10:28.838 --> 10:31.004
a 45-mile circle
after that.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.873
In a city, that's 10,000 office
buildings, 2,000 schools.

10:33.875 --> 10:37.243
Anywhere near a populated area,
that's 10 million lives.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.713
Three hours till impact,
but that is a guesstimate

10:41.715 --> 10:43.047
since we don't have the full
specs of the satellite

10:43.049 --> 10:44.581
due to Russian security.

10:44.583 --> 10:46.015
They can't just
give us the info?

10:46.017 --> 10:47.300
No, their official position

10:47.301 --> 10:48.584
is that they don't know
of any satellite.

10:48.586 --> 10:50.919
Means it's an illegal
spying operation.

10:50.921 --> 10:51.953
They can't admit to it.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.487
TOBY: They cover
their butts,

10:53.489 --> 10:55.722
and one-seventh of the U.S.
economy gets taken out.

10:55.724 --> 10:57.424
Win-win for Moscow.

10:57.425 --> 10:59.125
You need to hack the satellite,
reset its trajectory

10:59.127 --> 11:01.193
(tone ringing) so that
it dumps into the ocean.

11:01.195 --> 11:03.094
(distantly):
No land impact, no explosions.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.829
(ringing ends)
Are you with me, Mr. O'Brien?

11:04.831 --> 11:07.164
(normal): Yeah, yeah, it's
just gonna take fast coding.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.566
"No mistakes" is pretty hard to
pull off with a hand like this.

11:09.568 --> 11:10.934
I-I type 100
words per minute.

11:10.936 --> 11:12.802
Tell me what to do,
I won't mess up.

11:12.804 --> 11:14.203
ADRIANA:
Let me be clear.

11:14.205 --> 11:17.206
Between the fireball, air blast
and radiation fallout,

11:17.208 --> 11:18.941
there are 10 million lives
depending

11:18.943 --> 11:21.944
on the people in this SUV,
so messing up is not an option.

11:21.946 --> 11:24.846
Welcome back to
Scorpion, everyone.

11:36.159 --> 11:39.160
ADRIANA: Welcome to the
Rocketry Aeronautics Center.

11:39.162 --> 11:42.163
Wow, you really cleared the place out.
SYLVESTER: This is so cool.

11:42.165 --> 11:43.498
Well, White House
can't risk a panic.

11:43.499 --> 11:44.832
Civilians find out
what's happening,

11:44.834 --> 11:45.966
and they tell
one family member...

11:45.968 --> 11:47.300
You got<i> War of</i>
<i> the World.</i>

11:47.302 --> 11:48.834
Little listened-to
radio broadcast,

11:48.836 --> 11:49.968
but panic spread
in minutes.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.837
Well, speaking of minutes,
we have 141.

11:52.839 --> 11:54.339
Let's hustle.

11:54.340 --> 11:55.840
WALTER: Okay, log in,
run init dash boot,

11:55.842 --> 11:58.576
backslash force,
main colon IP host.

11:59.679 --> 12:02.680
Okay, 3.2.168.4.

12:02.682 --> 12:05.149
That's a wonderful job.

12:05.151 --> 12:06.683
You're doing great.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.751
Oh, good to be working
with you again.

12:08.753 --> 12:10.753
As a team.

12:10.755 --> 12:11.920
Yeah, I concur.

12:11.922 --> 12:14.689
So much for no
fraternization.

12:16.225 --> 12:17.891
Um, Sly?

12:17.893 --> 12:20.126
I'm not reading a live
signal from the satellite.

12:20.128 --> 12:21.861
There's nothing
to connect to.

12:21.863 --> 12:23.262
Something's wrong.
It doesn't make sense.

12:23.263 --> 12:24.662
Could it be too damaged
from space debris?

12:24.665 --> 12:26.348
Unlikely.

12:26.349 --> 12:28.032
It's not unlikely,
it's nearly impossible.

12:28.035 --> 12:29.801
Space debris is
dust, a centimeter.

12:29.803 --> 12:31.702
A swarm of it could knock
a satellite from orbit,

12:31.704 --> 12:33.603
but cause severe
structural damage?

12:33.605 --> 12:36.005
What exactly are you insinuating?
I'm not insinuating anything.

12:36.007 --> 12:37.673
Easy pal.
I'm saying it's illogical

12:37.675 --> 12:38.840
that we can't get
into a system

12:38.842 --> 12:40.842
that has minimal
damage; it doesn't jive

12:40.844 --> 12:42.210
with the information
you've provided us with.

12:42.212 --> 12:43.811
PAIGE: Okay, let's
take a break.

12:43.813 --> 12:45.279
Sylvester,
take over the hack?

12:45.281 --> 12:46.946
SYLVESTER:
You got it.

12:50.318 --> 12:52.751
PAIGE: Okay,
first day back,

12:52.753 --> 12:54.686
so your people skills
are a little rusty,

12:54.688 --> 12:56.788
but that's our new boss you just
mouthed off to.

12:56.790 --> 12:59.791
(tone ringing)
(distantly):  Walter.

12:59.793 --> 13:01.259
(ringing ends)
Walter.

13:01.261 --> 13:02.627
Are you okay?

13:02.629 --> 13:04.245
(mumbling):
Yeah, I'm okay.

13:04.246 --> 13:05.862
I just got... I just got...
I got a headache.

13:05.865 --> 13:07.865
Yeah, I've had headaches,
that wasn't not one.

13:07.867 --> 13:09.132
What-what the
hell is going on?

13:11.369 --> 13:13.902
I've got post-concussion
syndrome from the accident.

13:13.904 --> 13:17.205
I get head pains,
dizziness, blackouts

13:17.207 --> 13:18.739
whenever I have
to concentrate hard

13:18.741 --> 13:20.874
or whenever things
g-get intense.

13:20.876 --> 13:22.742
Intense?

13:22.744 --> 13:25.111
Intense is all
we're dealing with.

13:25.113 --> 13:27.246
Why would your doctor let...?

13:27.248 --> 13:28.780
He doesn't know about this.

13:28.782 --> 13:29.881
I assume Cabe is
in the dark, too?

13:29.883 --> 13:31.866
Please don't say anything.

13:31.867 --> 13:33.850
They've never seen me
at less than optimum efficiency.

13:33.853 --> 13:35.719
It could affect
their performance,

13:35.721 --> 13:37.854
and I can't afford
that today.

13:37.856 --> 13:39.722
None of us can.

13:39.724 --> 13:40.789
Okay, assess yourself.

13:40.791 --> 13:43.124
And don't lie.

13:43.126 --> 13:44.792
Doctor said I will be
fully recovered

13:44.794 --> 13:46.126
by the end of the month.

13:46.128 --> 13:49.395
Right now, I am 70%.

13:49.397 --> 13:52.064
Perhaps that's why I can't
hack the system.

13:52.066 --> 13:54.299
There's millions of lives...

13:54.301 --> 13:55.967
What if I can't do this?

13:55.969 --> 13:57.835
The same question I've
been asking myself

13:57.837 --> 13:59.303
since you expanded
my role on the team.

13:59.305 --> 14:00.971
Walter, I've been
having nightmares

14:00.973 --> 14:02.973
about being a
waitress again, okay?

14:02.975 --> 14:05.942
Fear of failure is a
feeling you're not used to,

14:05.944 --> 14:08.277
so let's make a pact:

14:08.279 --> 14:09.945
I support you,
you support me,

14:09.947 --> 14:11.346
and together we
make this work.

14:12.982 --> 14:14.982
SYLVESTER:
Walter, nothing is working.

14:14.984 --> 14:17.784
I can't even get an auxiliary
telemetry signal.

14:17.786 --> 14:19.018
We are losing time
we don't have.

14:19.020 --> 14:20.536
We need another way
to attack this.

14:20.537 --> 14:22.053
"Attack" being the operative
word-- sociologists have

14:22.056 --> 14:24.289
two schools of thought
on controls: internal controls,

14:24.291 --> 14:26.891
which we don't have 'cause
we can't get in the system,

14:26.893 --> 14:29.093
and external controls,
which is still an option.

14:29.094 --> 14:31.294
We blow the sucker out of the
stratosphere with a missile.

14:31.297 --> 14:32.963
To calculate the flight path
of the satellite,

14:32.965 --> 14:34.931
I need exact measurements.

14:34.933 --> 14:36.332
Uh, altitude profiles,

14:36.334 --> 14:37.900
the mass of all of its
interior components.

14:37.902 --> 14:40.903
Without precise data,
our trajectory will be off,

14:40.905 --> 14:43.272
and the missile will miss.
We considered an intercept,

14:43.274 --> 14:44.906
but we don't have
the specs you need.

14:44.908 --> 14:47.708
And it's not like you guys have
the time to hack Roscosmos

14:47.710 --> 14:49.176
and steal the Russian
blueprints, do you?

14:49.178 --> 14:51.077
No, even if I was doing
the keystrokes myself,

14:51.079 --> 14:52.411
it would take a
minimum of a day.

14:52.413 --> 14:54.079
That's it-- keystrokes.

14:54.081 --> 14:55.780
We don't need to hack
into Roscosmos

14:55.782 --> 14:57.081
if we could read
the keyboard strokes

14:57.083 --> 14:58.415
of someone entering
the Russian system.

14:58.417 --> 15:00.367
Then we'd have the password.

15:00.368 --> 15:02.318
How are we gonna get our eyes
on some commie's keyboard?

15:02.320 --> 15:04.320
Last I checked, Russia's
pretty far away.

15:04.322 --> 15:06.889
There's Russian soil here in L.A.
The Russian consulate.

15:06.891 --> 15:08.423
Yeah, Happy, can...?
HAPPY: Yes, I can.

15:08.425 --> 15:10.792
Cabe, give me the keys
to the SUV.

15:10.794 --> 15:12.360
You guys prep,
we'll be back soon.

15:12.362 --> 15:14.228
Uh...

15:14.230 --> 15:16.830
And I will need this, too.

15:17.933 --> 15:19.265
TOBY:<i> Do you really think</i>
<i> this will work?</i>

15:19.267 --> 15:21.233
It sends a signal
to unlock a car.

15:21.235 --> 15:23.401
I'm just reversing it
to receive a signal.

15:23.403 --> 15:26.003
I attach two fork prongs,
shove it into an outlet,

15:26.005 --> 15:27.904
we pick up every keystroke
on the Ruskies' computer.

15:27.906 --> 15:30.740
Including when they type in
the password to Roscosmos.

15:30.742 --> 15:33.209
Speaking of receiving signals,
got the message loud and clear:

15:33.211 --> 15:35.377
you don't want
fraternization at work.

15:35.379 --> 15:36.911
This is what we want
to talk about

15:36.913 --> 15:38.012
when SoCal's
about to blow up?

15:38.014 --> 15:39.346
If today's my
expiration date,

15:39.348 --> 15:40.914
this is all I want
to talk about.

15:40.916 --> 15:43.049
In short...

15:43.051 --> 15:45.484
I'm like mold
sporing on aged cheese.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.820
At first it's gross,
but it grows on you.

15:48.822 --> 15:50.288
And eventually, you realize
how precious it is,

15:50.290 --> 15:52.723
what a rare and wonderful
fungus you have.

15:52.725 --> 15:54.891
You better hope by then
this fungus hasn't moved on.

15:54.893 --> 15:56.792
Right.
Really? You agree?

15:56.794 --> 15:58.960
No, make a right!
Oh.

15:59.896 --> 16:01.963
<i> (elevator bell dings)</i>

16:01.964 --> 16:04.031
By the way, you're a
tech emissary from Japan

16:04.033 --> 16:06.033
with no language skills.
Because?

16:06.035 --> 16:08.168
Some sexist Russian dude faced
with a nonverbal woman,

16:08.170 --> 16:09.502
you'll be
invisible to him.

16:09.504 --> 16:10.870
You can safely
plant the device.

16:10.872 --> 16:13.038
(Toby sighs)

16:13.040 --> 16:15.340
Oh,<i> borscht.</i>

16:15.342 --> 16:17.342
May I help you?

16:17.344 --> 16:19.377
Hi, I'm Dr.
Tobias Curtis.

16:19.379 --> 16:22.012
This is my tech attaché,
Yuzuki Fujimoto.

16:23.115 --> 16:24.447
<i> Konnichiw.</i>

16:24.449 --> 16:26.882
I'm with Homeland,
and we're having some trouble

16:26.884 --> 16:29.885
connecting with Roscosmos, and
it's urgent we speak with them.

16:29.887 --> 16:31.152
Matter of national security.

16:31.154 --> 16:33.053
(speaks Japanese)

16:34.823 --> 16:36.289
TOBY:
Oh, you speak Japanese.

16:36.291 --> 16:38.057
How fortunate.

16:38.059 --> 16:39.491
(speaks Japanese)

16:45.965 --> 16:48.098
(speaks Japanese)

16:53.939 --> 16:55.772
TOBY:
Oh, my goodness.

16:55.774 --> 16:57.173
So clumsy.

17:12.856 --> 17:14.922
(snapping fingers)
Hey, you.

17:14.924 --> 17:17.424
What are you doing? Oh, sorry, I
was just getting the last pen.

17:17.426 --> 17:19.192
Rolled all the
way back here.

17:19.194 --> 17:21.194
Can I just say:

17:21.196 --> 17:23.196
you have none of the warm
friendly personality traits

17:23.198 --> 17:24.530
that Russians are known for.

17:24.532 --> 17:26.131
Miss Fujimoto.

17:30.203 --> 17:32.236
Okay, Happy, we're prepped
and ready to receive the data.

17:32.238 --> 17:34.338
HAPPY: Almost done, I'm just
translating it from Cyrillic.

17:34.340 --> 17:36.039
WALTER: All right,
that security officer

17:36.041 --> 17:37.874
must have started typing
as soon as you left.

17:37.876 --> 17:40.009
Huh? Warning Roscosmos

17:40.011 --> 17:41.977
that American nut jobs
are demanding access.

17:41.979 --> 17:44.012
I'm good at this,
I admit it.

17:44.014 --> 17:48.816
Okay, password
is D-W-O-P-P-Y-U.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.118
K dash N dash 2,000,

17:51.120 --> 17:52.986
run enter.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.220
Okay, we're in.

17:54.222 --> 17:56.021
Sly, you're on.

17:56.023 --> 17:59.123
Searching the system now for any
data on Russian K12 satellites.

18:00.893 --> 18:03.193
Bingo, somebody pad me.

18:03.195 --> 18:05.028
Do you know what he's doing?

18:05.030 --> 18:06.496
Of course, he's plugging in
all the variables that could

18:06.498 --> 18:08.030
affect the, uh, trajectory
of the satellite's fall--

18:08.032 --> 18:09.464
shape, mass,
moment of inertia.

18:09.466 --> 18:10.531
Got it.

18:12.201 --> 18:14.568
These are the exact coordinates
of the satellite's path--

18:14.570 --> 18:16.269
where it is, where it's going,
changing by the second.

18:16.271 --> 18:18.137
How fast can you get
a missile in the sky?

18:18.139 --> 18:20.239
As fast as I can dial.

18:20.240 --> 18:22.340
This is Adriana Molina,
authorization code:

18:22.343 --> 18:25.610
Foxtrot, Foxtrot,
Bravo, Darla, 6-2-6-9.

18:25.612 --> 18:27.111
I have coordinates

18:27.113 --> 18:29.012
for a projectile intercept;
prepare to receive.

18:29.014 --> 18:31.014
COMMANDER:<i> Coordinates</i>
<i> confirmed and locked.</i>

18:31.016 --> 18:33.082
<i> Three, two, one, launch.</i>

18:38.455 --> 18:40.154
We miss the fireworks?

18:40.156 --> 18:42.055
CABE:
About to start.

18:42.057 --> 18:43.523
You know, Adriana, I was
wondering if Homeland told you

18:43.525 --> 18:44.991
about our "saving
the world" bonus?

18:44.993 --> 18:46.859
It's for when we
save the world.

18:46.861 --> 18:49.328
No, but I was made aware
of money you owe the IRS

18:49.330 --> 18:51.363
on undeclared gambling
winnings.

18:51.365 --> 18:54.366
Maybe we should table
the bonus talk for now, hmm?

18:54.368 --> 18:56.000
This is bad, this is bad.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.268
What?

18:58.270 --> 18:59.435
Paths are off;
they're gonna miss.

18:59.437 --> 19:00.636
Can't be, I-I did the math.

19:01.605 --> 19:02.904
Look, the missile's
coming in high.

19:12.181 --> 19:13.280
How could this happen?

19:13.282 --> 19:14.614
I-I don't know,
I did the calculations,

19:14.616 --> 19:16.182
and they were right--
they're always right.

19:16.184 --> 19:18.117
I'm sorry, I don't know
how I messed up, guys.

19:18.119 --> 19:19.635
CABE:
Maybe you didn't.

19:19.636 --> 19:21.152
Maybe you just got
some bad intel.

19:21.155 --> 19:22.604
It happens
all the time.

19:22.605 --> 19:24.054
Oh, no, the specs came
directly from Roscosmos.

19:24.057 --> 19:25.056
But we were working
on assumptions,

19:25.058 --> 19:26.624
the first one being:

19:26.625 --> 19:28.191
we're dealing with a satellite
damaged by space debris.

19:28.194 --> 19:30.194
Walter questioned me on it,
maybe he was right to do so.

19:30.196 --> 19:32.095
What do you mean?
I don't know,

19:32.097 --> 19:33.513
but I'm gonna find out,

19:33.514 --> 19:34.930
'cause I got a direct line
to the horse's mouth.

19:36.301 --> 19:38.167
Something's not adding
up, and I'm missing it.

19:38.169 --> 19:39.168
It's my fault.

19:39.170 --> 19:40.653
No, it isn't.

19:40.654 --> 19:42.137
If I can't think, if I can't
solve, then what damn good am I?

19:42.139 --> 19:44.172
ADRIANA:
This is Molina.

19:44.173 --> 19:46.206
Yes, sir, I am aware
that it failed.

19:46.209 --> 19:48.075
I'm calling you to find out why.

19:48.077 --> 19:50.110
Respectfully, the
people in my room

19:50.112 --> 19:52.178
are smarter than the
people in your room,

19:52.180 --> 19:54.079
and they say that it
should have worked.

19:54.081 --> 19:56.081
So either a room full
of geniuses are suddenly dumb,

19:56.083 --> 19:57.549
or a room full
of politicians are lying

19:57.551 --> 19:58.550
to protect their own hide.

19:58.552 --> 20:00.218
I know which one
I would bet on.

20:00.220 --> 20:02.086
Is she talking
to the president like that?

20:02.088 --> 20:03.954
I believe she is.

20:03.956 --> 20:05.422
I'm getting audited.

20:05.424 --> 20:07.123
ADRIANA: Well, your
candor is appreciated.

20:07.125 --> 20:09.058
Walter was right.

20:09.060 --> 20:10.926
Space debris did not knock
this satellite out of orbit,

20:10.928 --> 20:12.327
the U.S. government did,
intentionally.

20:12.329 --> 20:13.561
Geez!

20:13.563 --> 20:14.662
Care to elaborate?

20:14.664 --> 20:16.196
The administration believes

20:16.198 --> 20:18.231
the K12 satellite had
military applications.

20:18.233 --> 20:19.733
It was carrying
enough plutonium

20:19.734 --> 20:21.234
to operate a laser system that
could be used as a weapon,

20:21.236 --> 20:23.536
so they directed a dummy
satellite to strike it

20:23.538 --> 20:26.071
and disrupt its orbit.
It was kept hush-hush

20:26.073 --> 20:27.939
'cause we violated
the space-warfare treaty.

20:27.941 --> 20:30.074
If the Russians found out,
it could be all-out war.

20:30.076 --> 20:32.209
Yeah, the satellites must have
gotten intertwined,

20:32.211 --> 20:34.444
the mass was much larger
than we thought.

20:34.446 --> 20:37.046
The missile never had a chance.
SYLVESTER: I just hacked NORAD,

20:37.048 --> 20:38.981
and I got the specs
for the dummy satellite.

20:38.983 --> 20:40.582
I am now recalculating
flight dynamics,

20:40.584 --> 20:43.585
considering the massive
shifts in center of mass,

20:43.587 --> 20:45.320
aerodynamic drag profile

20:45.322 --> 20:47.689
and the complete modification
of angular acceleration.

20:47.691 --> 20:50.091
(computer beeps)
Impact is in 53 minutes

20:50.093 --> 20:51.425
and it's headed
straight for Pasadena.

20:51.427 --> 20:52.509
HAPPY:
With that mass,

20:52.510 --> 20:53.592
the satellite's
too close to the Earth

20:53.595 --> 20:54.727
to be safely
destroyed.

20:54.729 --> 20:56.995
We hit it now,
it's nuclear winter.

20:56.997 --> 20:58.129
So there's no way to stop it?

20:58.131 --> 20:59.130
WALTER:
There's got to be a way,

20:59.132 --> 21:00.598
I just have
to figure it out.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.166
Okay, uh,
close the window

21:02.168 --> 21:04.468
and open the coding
file on my laptop.

21:04.470 --> 21:06.269
No, no! No, no! Not that one!
What?

21:06.271 --> 21:08.204
PAIGE: 'Cause I really care
about you, Walter. Ah...

21:09.173 --> 21:11.039
Oh...

21:11.041 --> 21:15.243
PAIGE: Because I really
care about you, Walter.

21:15.245 --> 21:17.211
Because I really care
about you, Walter.

21:17.213 --> 21:20.013
You hacked the hospital
security footage?

21:20.015 --> 21:23.182
Because I really care
about you, Walter.

21:25.586 --> 21:27.285
Bet that satellite
can't get here

21:27.287 --> 21:29.353
fast enough for you,
huh, pal?

21:34.693 --> 21:36.092
Okay.

21:36.094 --> 21:38.527
It was, uh, simple curiosity

21:38.529 --> 21:40.095
and, uh, gathering of the facts.
Nothing more.

21:40.097 --> 21:41.529
ADRIANA:
Okay.

21:41.531 --> 21:43.397
If we're done
with the film festival,

21:43.399 --> 21:44.664
do we have
a plan "B"?

21:44.666 --> 21:46.666
Yeah, we will.
I'm, uh, I'm thinking...

21:46.668 --> 21:49.435
(multiple phones ringing)

21:49.437 --> 21:51.537
CABE:
That would be NASA,

21:51.539 --> 21:53.456
NORAD, the UN,
and NATO...

21:53.457 --> 21:55.374
all wanting to know about
the unplanned missile launch.

21:55.376 --> 21:56.541
We'll let the machine get it.

21:56.543 --> 21:58.209
(phones continue ringing)

22:00.580 --> 22:02.713
(electrical crackling,
phones stop ringing)

22:04.550 --> 22:06.416
My head is in the game. I...

22:06.418 --> 22:07.650
Look, if we are seriously
at a brick wall,

22:07.652 --> 22:09.385
I'm calling for a chopper
out of L.A.

22:09.387 --> 22:10.552
What, and let
ten million people die?

22:10.554 --> 22:12.070
We cannot do that.

22:12.071 --> 22:13.587
ADRIANA: Look, there
is nothing left to do.

22:13.590 --> 22:15.189
By saving yourselves,

22:15.191 --> 22:17.324
your minds will save
millions more down the line.

22:17.326 --> 22:18.591
Just not today.

22:23.564 --> 22:25.697
I'm sorry, guys,
I don't...

22:25.699 --> 22:27.031
I don't have a solution.

22:27.033 --> 22:29.566
Well, if you don't, no one does.

22:29.568 --> 22:31.534
Adriana's right--
we gotta go.

22:31.536 --> 22:33.102
ADRIANA:
Everyone to the roof.

22:33.104 --> 22:34.636
We'll be airborne
in ten minutes.

22:42.445 --> 22:43.644
Wait, guys!

22:43.646 --> 22:45.062
Guys, the reason why
we can't communicate

22:45.063 --> 22:46.479
with the satellite
is because it's too far away

22:46.482 --> 22:47.781
for its damaged system

22:47.783 --> 22:49.682
to connect with RAC on Earth.

22:49.684 --> 22:51.116
We just need another way

22:51.118 --> 22:52.684
of talking to it.

22:52.686 --> 22:54.385
The unmanned
X-24G spacecraft.

22:54.387 --> 22:56.120
Whoa!
That's a top secret spy shuttle.

22:56.122 --> 22:57.421
How do you even
know about that?

22:57.423 --> 22:58.755
That jet's the worst kept
secret in the Air Force.

22:58.757 --> 23:00.556
Multiple blogs
follow it.

23:00.558 --> 23:02.090
WALTER: Okay, okay,
so control of the 24G

23:02.092 --> 23:04.759
is based out of
Thomas Air Force Base.

23:04.761 --> 23:06.627
Okay, so if we can get there
and access the 24G's computer,

23:06.629 --> 23:07.661
then we can communicate

23:07.663 --> 23:08.762
effectively with
the satellite

23:08.764 --> 23:10.463
if they get close
enough to each other.

23:10.465 --> 23:13.666
It'll be in proximity over
U.S. Samoa in 48 minutes.

23:13.668 --> 23:15.334
We could then redirect
it into the ocean.

23:15.336 --> 23:18.437
Okay, Thomas is
within blast radius.

23:18.439 --> 23:19.504
If this doesn't work,

23:19.506 --> 23:20.838
none of us make it
to safety on time.

23:24.743 --> 23:26.542
We're aware of the risks.

23:26.544 --> 23:27.843
Okay, Sylvester
you stay here

23:27.845 --> 23:29.511
and you prepare
the new trajectory codes.

23:29.513 --> 23:31.145
I will reboot
the satellite at the base,

23:31.147 --> 23:32.713
you send me
the coordinates.

23:32.715 --> 23:34.148
SYLVESTER:
I'm here alone?

23:34.149 --> 23:35.582
What if someone
who tried to call shows up?

23:35.584 --> 23:36.649
I'll stay.

23:36.651 --> 23:37.750
Chopper's on the roof.

23:37.752 --> 23:38.817
You heard her. Let's go.

23:40.187 --> 23:41.319
Whoa.
Oh!

23:41.321 --> 23:43.621
So y... uh,
about the, uh, video...

23:43.623 --> 23:47.324
Walter, let's talk about it
after we stop the A-bomb.

23:49.127 --> 23:51.193
(indistinct shouting)

24:02.672 --> 24:04.405
Agent Gallo!

24:04.407 --> 24:06.440
Flight Research
is this way!

24:06.442 --> 24:08.141
Where's everyone going?

24:08.143 --> 24:10.376
When we get word the whole
coast is about to light up,

24:10.378 --> 24:12.811
our orders are to take
this operation and bug out!

24:12.813 --> 24:15.113
Hope you work fast.

24:15.115 --> 24:18.116
Everyone's leaving,
we're showing up.

24:18.118 --> 24:21.685
HAPPY: <i> Accessing the
X-24G's</i> <i> flight control now.</i>

24:24.690 --> 24:25.822
Okay, we're in.

24:25.824 --> 24:28.791
Type colon run init
dash backslash link

24:28.793 --> 24:30.659
X dash band.

24:30.661 --> 24:33.061
I'm-I'm having a hard time
hearing you.

24:33.062 --> 24:35.462
His physical distance mirrors
his psychological state,

24:35.465 --> 24:36.697
on account of the video incident

24:36.699 --> 24:38.432
which I've dubbed
"the embarrassment."

24:38.434 --> 24:40.567
WALTER:
Okay, when 24G crosses,

24:40.569 --> 24:42.435
it will find and link up
with the satellite's computer.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.270
We will only have
20 seconds

24:44.272 --> 24:45.537
to reprogram the satellite.

24:45.539 --> 24:48.172
Beyond that,
and they'll be too far apart

24:48.174 --> 24:49.339
to communicate.

24:49.341 --> 24:50.573
Oh. Okay. Okay.

24:50.575 --> 24:52.241
We're in range in three, two...

24:52.243 --> 24:53.909
Go, Sylvester!

24:53.911 --> 24:55.877
Reprogramming
new coordinates now...

24:57.847 --> 24:59.813
It's not accepting them.

24:59.815 --> 25:01.447
The 24G and the satellite
haven't linked yet.

25:01.449 --> 25:03.682
Wait. Why is it so slow?

25:03.684 --> 25:05.784
I... The link
should've happened.

25:05.786 --> 25:07.152
I have a virus.

25:07.153 --> 25:08.519
SYLVESTER: Well, you better
hurry up and get rid of it!

25:08.520 --> 25:09.886
There's only 14 seconds
until the 24G

25:09.890 --> 25:11.456
and the satellite are
out of range of each other.

25:11.458 --> 25:12.457
I'm trying.

25:12.459 --> 25:13.791
Since when do you get a virus?

25:13.793 --> 25:14.925
You got it from
the hospital server

25:14.927 --> 25:16.693
when you hacked the video!

25:16.695 --> 25:17.860
Walter, nine seconds. Yeah,
I know, I know. I'm try...

25:17.862 --> 25:18.927
I'm running a clean-up
with my left hand.

25:18.929 --> 25:20.929
Come on, kid, you can do this.

25:20.931 --> 25:21.729
Almost done.

25:21.731 --> 25:22.763
Five seconds!

25:22.765 --> 25:23.730
Got it clear!

25:23.732 --> 25:25.565
Try to link up now!

25:25.567 --> 25:27.300
Entering new
coordinates now and...

25:35.208 --> 25:37.341
Did it work?

25:37.343 --> 25:39.676
The 24G and the satellite
are too far apart.

25:39.678 --> 25:41.544
It did not work.

25:44.749 --> 25:46.281
I'm not gonna mention the irony

25:46.283 --> 25:47.782
of getting a virus
from a hospital.

25:49.452 --> 25:50.751
I said I wouldn't mention it.

25:50.753 --> 25:53.487
We should have taken
the helicopter.

25:53.489 --> 25:55.322
I hate helicopters,
but you're right.

25:57.192 --> 25:59.358
No one is
dying today.

25:59.360 --> 26:00.525
Aside from
the ten million

26:00.527 --> 26:01.559
I failed to save?

26:01.561 --> 26:02.560
Walter, no one is dying.

26:02.562 --> 26:04.028
My son is 3,000 miles away

26:04.029 --> 26:05.495
and I'll be damned if
I'm not going to see him again.

26:05.498 --> 26:07.897
(exhales)

26:10.268 --> 26:11.600
Paige...

26:11.602 --> 26:13.702
we discussed the reality
of an A-bomb in the SUV.

26:13.704 --> 26:15.870
We're in
the concussive blast zone.

26:15.872 --> 26:17.438
If you want to call Ralph,

26:17.440 --> 26:18.839
call him now.

26:22.544 --> 26:23.709
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

26:23.711 --> 26:24.910
Wait. Don't call him.
Don't call him.

26:24.912 --> 26:25.744
Happy, what were
you talking about,

26:25.746 --> 26:26.945
a concussive blast?

26:26.947 --> 26:28.413
We can do that
to the satellite

26:28.415 --> 26:29.414
with an
electromagnetic pulse.

26:29.416 --> 26:31.549
We can reboot

26:31.551 --> 26:33.884
the satellite's computer
to safe mode

26:33.886 --> 26:36.319
and then Sylvester can reprogram

26:36.321 --> 26:38.888
its trajectory coordinates
and then send it to the ocean.

26:38.890 --> 26:40.623
Wouldn't an EMP just fry it?

26:40.625 --> 26:42.758
Not if the pulse
width was precise.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.760
I could build one easily,
but how the hell

26:44.762 --> 26:46.278
do we get it near
the satellite?

26:46.279 --> 26:47.795
There is a meteorology division
here in this base.

26:47.798 --> 26:49.564
We use a
weather balloon.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.865
Now, how long would it take you
to make an EMP device?

26:50.867 --> 26:51.765
Fast enough.

26:51.767 --> 26:52.766
I just need
to get my hands

26:52.768 --> 26:53.800
on some microwave ovens.

26:53.802 --> 26:55.601
So it's 25 minutes
until impact.

26:55.603 --> 26:57.502
We meet outside
at the front gates in seven!

26:57.504 --> 26:58.803
Microwave ovens?

26:58.805 --> 27:01.372
Well, how would you
build an EMP?

27:02.775 --> 27:04.541
(tires screeching)

27:09.013 --> 27:10.312
Okay.

27:10.314 --> 27:11.313
Yeah, this'll do.

27:11.315 --> 27:12.914
How many
do we need?

27:12.916 --> 27:15.316
All of them.

27:15.785 --> 27:17.417
Oh.

27:20.755 --> 27:23.622
Need all the luck I can get.

27:28.328 --> 27:30.328
Okay, all right.

27:30.330 --> 27:32.730
Quick test.

27:35.935 --> 27:38.334
Keep your shorts on,
I will figure it out.

27:41.806 --> 27:43.539
Here. A loose wire.

27:45.709 --> 27:46.441
Happy?
Happy!

27:46.443 --> 27:47.775
Happy!

27:47.777 --> 27:48.909
You all right?

27:48.911 --> 27:49.976
Works like a charm.

27:49.978 --> 27:52.511
Let me see
your eye.

27:52.513 --> 27:54.479
Uh...

27:54.481 --> 27:55.780
Okay, bad news:

27:55.782 --> 27:57.381
Your eye is rock hard.

27:57.383 --> 27:58.615
There's pressure
building up inside it.

27:58.617 --> 28:00.617
But good news:
I can fix it.

28:00.619 --> 28:01.851
Toby, she needs to get
in the balloon with me

28:01.853 --> 28:03.285
to operate the EMP.

28:03.287 --> 28:04.753
Change in air pressure
will rupture her eye,

28:04.755 --> 28:06.554
and I have
to treat her stat,

28:06.556 --> 28:07.555
or else she'll
go blind.

28:07.557 --> 28:08.622
Suit me up. WALTER: No, no.

28:08.624 --> 28:09.756
That's-that's
too much weight.

28:09.758 --> 28:11.624
We'll ascend too slowly

28:11.626 --> 28:12.925
and then miss the window
to reboot the satellite.

28:12.927 --> 28:13.926
I'm going.
No.

28:13.928 --> 28:14.893
It's below freezing conditions,

28:14.895 --> 28:16.427
oxygen deprivation,

28:16.429 --> 28:17.594
not to mention
it's a one-way ticket up.

28:17.596 --> 28:18.895
Only way down
is to parachute.

28:18.897 --> 28:20.796
We said we'd support each other
in this thing.

28:20.798 --> 28:21.963
Neither of us can do it alone,

28:21.965 --> 28:24.031
but together,
we have a shot.

28:26.368 --> 28:27.667
All right. Get your coat on.

28:32.940 --> 28:33.972
WALTER (grunts):
All right.

28:33.974 --> 28:35.606
It's difficult
one-handed.

28:35.608 --> 28:36.707
Okay.

28:36.709 --> 28:38.342
This looks like
a science fair project.

28:38.343 --> 28:39.976
It'll work? Yeah. I mean,
in theory it will,

28:39.978 --> 28:42.078
but sometimes you don't know
if a theory is right

28:42.080 --> 28:43.679
until you test it.

28:45.349 --> 28:46.314
Ready?

28:46.316 --> 28:47.982
(exhales)

28:47.984 --> 28:49.783
See you on the ground.
WALTER:  Yeah.

28:49.785 --> 28:51.551
One way or another.

29:05.900 --> 29:06.965
Oh...
You good?

29:06.967 --> 29:08.666
PAIGE: Yeah. All right.

29:08.668 --> 29:10.000
PAIGE:
Oh.

29:10.002 --> 29:12.068
Say good-bye
to the ground.

29:19.343 --> 29:20.909
(teeth chattering)

29:20.911 --> 29:22.710
I'm freezing.

29:22.712 --> 29:24.912
Yeah, well,
this is just cold.

29:24.914 --> 29:25.913
Freezing happens
in a few minutes,

29:25.915 --> 29:27.648
when we get outside.
Ah...

29:27.650 --> 29:29.983
Yeah, just hold on.

29:31.753 --> 29:33.753
Ah, all right.
No punching.

29:33.755 --> 29:34.854
I know it hurts.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.522
But your eye is
filled with fluid

29:36.524 --> 29:39.057
and the drain,
Schlemm's Canal, is blocked.

29:39.059 --> 29:40.892
That is not a real term,
you made it up.

29:40.894 --> 29:41.826
It is very real.

29:41.828 --> 29:43.661
Pushing on your eyelid

29:43.663 --> 29:44.995
is like using a plunger on a...

29:46.765 --> 29:48.731
You get the idea.

29:48.733 --> 29:50.532
It's ironic that
you trust me

29:50.534 --> 29:52.767
to save your sight
but not date you.

29:54.637 --> 29:55.669
Just keep plunging.

29:55.671 --> 29:58.371
(wind whistling)

30:03.777 --> 30:05.676
Ah, God, I'm sorry.

30:05.678 --> 30:08.011
If I hadn't hacked into
that hospital footage,

30:08.013 --> 30:09.979
then we'd all be
back at the garage.

30:09.981 --> 30:11.747
Everyone safe.

30:11.749 --> 30:12.848
Walter, you didn't know.

30:12.850 --> 30:15.417
We said open communication,
so...

30:20.624 --> 30:22.557
I have had, uh,
feelings about you,

30:22.559 --> 30:25.760
similar to the ones
that you've had about me.

30:25.762 --> 30:28.395
They confused me,
but, ironically,

30:28.397 --> 30:32.765
my, uh, head injury
has provided some clarity.

30:32.767 --> 30:35.167
Uh...

30:35.169 --> 30:37.836
when I'm not at 100%,
it frightens me.

30:37.838 --> 30:39.971
That I won't be able
to help the greater good.

30:39.973 --> 30:43.540
But when I am
fully healthy, I...

30:46.111 --> 30:49.078
I can't risk
Scorpion not working.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.780
So you and me,

30:51.782 --> 30:53.982
whatever feelings
we have, um...

30:53.984 --> 30:55.984
for each other,
it's, uh...

30:55.986 --> 30:58.519
(exhales)

30:58.521 --> 30:59.920
...it's destabilizing.
You know?

31:01.890 --> 31:03.823
(exhales)

31:03.825 --> 31:05.524
I think you're right.

31:05.526 --> 31:07.926
We should let it lie.

31:09.162 --> 31:12.129
Yeah, what did I tell you
about my nightmares?

31:12.131 --> 31:14.531
The entire time
you were in rehab,

31:14.533 --> 31:17.166
I realized how close we
came to losing the team.

31:17.168 --> 31:20.969
And what they meant to me.

31:20.971 --> 31:23.170
I would never do anything
to jeopardize Scorpion.

31:26.742 --> 31:28.575
So...

31:28.577 --> 31:30.076
yeah, I agree.

31:30.078 --> 31:31.844
Friends

31:31.846 --> 31:33.211
and colleagues.

31:36.883 --> 31:38.616
TOBY:
I agree as well.

31:38.618 --> 31:39.617
We can hear you.

31:39.619 --> 31:40.918
SYLVESTER:
Guys?

31:40.920 --> 31:42.452
you're about to be within range
of the satellite.

31:42.454 --> 31:44.487
Set the device.

31:46.023 --> 31:47.889
Okay, I'm gonna go up.

31:47.891 --> 31:49.590
Go. Good luck.

31:55.196 --> 31:57.162
The satellite is about
to pass within range.

31:58.565 --> 31:59.964
WALTER:
All right!

31:59.966 --> 32:02.633
Almost in position.

32:06.939 --> 32:08.538
Walter!

32:11.075 --> 32:12.458
Everything okay up there?

32:12.459 --> 32:13.842
WALTER:
Yeah, just a little hiccup.

32:15.011 --> 32:17.511
(wind whistling,
Walter panting)

32:17.513 --> 32:19.045
Paige, I'll be right back!

32:19.047 --> 32:20.479
Bring the battery.

32:25.853 --> 32:27.485
Walter!

32:27.487 --> 32:28.853
Oh, hi.

32:34.860 --> 32:36.826
I-I-I can't reach the cord.

32:36.828 --> 32:38.894
The parachute buckles
are restricting my reach.

32:38.896 --> 32:40.829
Okay, okay.
No! No! No!

32:40.831 --> 32:41.896
That's a bad idea!

32:41.898 --> 32:44.031
(grunting)

32:44.033 --> 32:44.965
(sighs)

32:44.967 --> 32:47.734
(grunting)

32:47.736 --> 32:49.736
Okay, okay, okay!

32:49.738 --> 32:52.038
Oh, come on, come on!
Okay.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.073
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

32:55.910 --> 32:57.876
(grunting)

32:57.878 --> 32:59.010
I got it. I got
it! I got it!

33:00.780 --> 33:03.013
(tone ringing)

33:06.852 --> 33:08.952
(gasping)
Walter!

33:10.555 --> 33:11.754
Oh, God.

33:11.756 --> 33:13.789
Oh, that's a wrinkle.

33:13.791 --> 33:14.956
What he say?

33:14.958 --> 33:16.057
"That's a wrinkle"?

33:16.059 --> 33:18.626
What's a wrinkle?

33:18.628 --> 33:20.995
Ooh, that's a wrinkle.

33:20.997 --> 33:23.097
Not good.

33:23.099 --> 33:26.100
Okay, okay.

33:26.102 --> 33:27.234
Change of plans.

33:27.236 --> 33:28.802
Happy?

33:28.804 --> 33:30.136
Talk Paige
through the EMP sequence.

33:30.138 --> 33:31.537
SYLVESTER:
Better do it quick,

33:31.539 --> 33:32.771
because the satellite
is within range!

33:32.773 --> 33:34.939
PAIGE:
Okay, but be very...

33:34.941 --> 33:36.874
very clear because the air
is getting thin

33:36.876 --> 33:38.876
and I'm getting loopy.

33:38.878 --> 33:40.711
Okay, put the sun
on your left shoulder,

33:40.713 --> 33:43.714
angle it 45 degrees,
hit the red switch.

33:43.716 --> 33:45.248
Oh, God.

33:45.250 --> 33:47.717
(Paige panting)

33:49.687 --> 33:51.253
I think it's in position.

33:51.255 --> 33:52.854
Wait for Sylvester's
command, then hit

33:52.856 --> 33:54.288
the toggle switches from
left to right, got it?

33:54.290 --> 33:57.157
Okay.

33:57.159 --> 33:58.324
Dineen!

33:58.326 --> 34:00.326
Yeah, yeah, I'm ready to roll!

34:00.328 --> 34:01.560
Okay, Paige,

34:01.562 --> 34:04.062
ready... hit it!

34:05.331 --> 34:07.130
Guys...

34:07.132 --> 34:08.664
I'm a little...

34:08.666 --> 34:10.032
I can't, I can't focus!

34:10.034 --> 34:11.299
Did you say right to left?

34:11.301 --> 34:13.668
Left to right!
Get it together!

34:15.638 --> 34:17.704
WALTER:
Come on, Paige!

34:17.706 --> 34:19.639
Paige, you can do this.

34:23.177 --> 34:26.043
(whooshing)

34:28.313 --> 34:29.312
(gasps)
Safe mode!

34:29.314 --> 34:31.013
The satellite's in safe mode!

34:31.015 --> 34:32.164
What does that mean to us?

34:32.165 --> 34:33.314
That means that all
of its security measures

34:33.317 --> 34:35.150
have been disabled,

34:35.152 --> 34:36.584
and I can send it new
coordinates to direct it

34:36.586 --> 34:38.118
to the ocean.
MAN: Freeze!

34:38.120 --> 34:40.753
Do not move.

34:42.056 --> 34:43.622
If I can't type, we all die.

34:43.624 --> 34:47.092
Agent Adriana Molina,
Director of Homeland Security.

34:47.094 --> 34:48.726
Who the hell are you?

34:48.728 --> 34:50.344
D.o.D.

34:50.345 --> 34:51.961
NORAD said there was
an unauthorized missile launch

34:51.964 --> 34:53.129
at this site.

34:53.131 --> 34:54.630
It was authorized by me.

34:54.632 --> 34:55.998
You keep away from this man

34:56.000 --> 34:57.265
or I'll see to it
you're tried for treason.

34:57.267 --> 35:00.067
Sylvester, start typing.

35:00.069 --> 35:02.635
(Sylvester typing)

35:05.840 --> 35:08.073
Oh, God. Okay, Walter.
You got to climb.

35:08.075 --> 35:09.240
Come on.
The cold is cramping

35:09.242 --> 35:11.125
my good hand.

35:11.126 --> 35:13.009
And unfortunately
the balloon's at risk,

35:13.012 --> 35:14.745
so I would advise
a solo descent.

35:14.747 --> 35:16.179
What, without you?
No, no.

35:16.181 --> 35:17.780
I'm coming with you.

35:17.782 --> 35:18.847
No, no, no...
I'm just gonna have to--

35:18.849 --> 35:20.048
Oh, God-- climb down there.

35:20.050 --> 35:21.082
Stay there, Paige.

35:21.084 --> 35:22.650
Paige, stay there.
No.

35:22.652 --> 35:24.151
Paige, stay there!

35:24.153 --> 35:27.187
SYLVESTER: <i> With my new
coordinates</i> <i> in place,</i>

35:27.189 --> 35:28.321
we can use
the apogee kick motor

35:28.323 --> 35:29.955
to blast the satellite
into the ocean.

35:29.957 --> 35:32.023
I've routed the engine ignition

35:32.025 --> 35:34.158
to that console
to prevent possible overload.

35:34.160 --> 35:36.660
So, let's go, come on,
over there, yes. Okay.

35:36.662 --> 35:38.161
I'm buckling this

35:38.163 --> 35:39.862
around us.

35:39.864 --> 35:42.064
And we'll go down
together, okay?

35:42.066 --> 35:43.415
Okay, okay.

35:43.416 --> 35:44.765
You have to reach for it.
Yeah, yeah.

35:44.768 --> 35:47.068
Can you get it?
(groans)

35:47.070 --> 35:48.269
On my call, hit enter.

35:50.172 --> 35:51.871
Yeah, I got it.
I got it.

35:51.873 --> 35:53.205
I got it.
Hurry. Hurry.

35:53.207 --> 35:54.206
Okay, okay, got it.

35:54.208 --> 35:55.807
Ready?

35:57.177 --> 35:58.776
It's too short.

35:58.778 --> 36:00.711
What? It's too short--
it won't close!

36:00.713 --> 36:02.879
PAIGE:
Oh, God. Oh, God.

36:02.881 --> 36:04.180
SYLVESTER:
Ready?

36:04.182 --> 36:05.848
Now!

36:05.850 --> 36:08.083
(whooshing)

36:08.085 --> 36:09.751
It worked!

36:09.753 --> 36:10.885
The satellite's on a new vector

36:10.887 --> 36:12.019
and it's heading
straight to the ocean!

36:12.021 --> 36:13.687
So, you're saying we're saved?

36:13.689 --> 36:15.255
That's exactly what I'm saying!

36:15.257 --> 36:17.156
Except they're screwed.

36:17.158 --> 36:19.224
Oh, no!

36:19.226 --> 36:21.859
No! No! Walter!

36:21.861 --> 36:23.193
The satellite's on a new vector,

36:23.195 --> 36:24.928
and it's heading
straight towards you!

36:24.930 --> 36:26.129
(engine whooshing)

36:33.905 --> 36:37.106
(engine whooshing)

36:37.108 --> 36:39.708
I'm giving us
12 seconds until impact.

36:39.710 --> 36:41.827
You got to drop now. Walter,
I'm not leaving without you.

36:41.828 --> 36:42.962
Paige, you got to drop!
Paige, drop, Paige.

36:42.988 --> 36:43.945
Paige! Walter, I have,
I have an idea.

36:43.947 --> 36:45.846
Six seconds until impact!
Just drop, please.

36:45.848 --> 36:47.113
Hold on, I've almost
got this in.

36:47.115 --> 36:50.249
Five, four, three...
Paige, drop!

36:50.251 --> 36:52.451
Hold it steady,
I'm connect my end.

36:52.453 --> 36:53.852
Okay, drop!

36:53.854 --> 36:55.220
(screaming)

36:55.222 --> 36:57.288
(screaming, gasping)

37:00.159 --> 37:02.225
(Walter grunting)

37:03.761 --> 37:07.061
(Paige laughs)

37:10.766 --> 37:12.332
Well, it's a good thing
that we're just colleagues

37:12.334 --> 37:14.734
or this might be, uh...

37:14.736 --> 37:17.103
awkward.
(chuckles)

37:17.105 --> 37:19.338
(laughs)

37:19.340 --> 37:21.406
♪ ♪

37:25.745 --> 37:27.745
Okay, I want to get
the cameras here,

37:27.747 --> 37:29.279
and podium right in front
of that flag.

37:29.281 --> 37:30.713
Let's get ahead of this thing.

37:30.715 --> 37:33.248
Hey, can somebody move that?

37:33.250 --> 37:36.718
(sirens wailing)

37:36.720 --> 37:38.419
What?

37:38.421 --> 37:40.320
Use your words.

37:40.322 --> 37:42.388
Jerk.

37:44.325 --> 37:46.358
I'm scared.

37:46.360 --> 37:49.727
That's the first time
I've ever heard you say that.

37:51.297 --> 37:53.297
Happy?

37:53.299 --> 37:55.098
Do you know there's a better
chance of a nuclear apocalypse

37:55.100 --> 37:57.133
than of me ever hurting you?

38:07.378 --> 38:09.444
What do you see?

38:11.381 --> 38:14.882
A rare and delightful fungus.

38:14.884 --> 38:17.918
ADRIANA: <i> The satellite is
being</i> <i> recovered five miles</i>

38:17.920 --> 38:19.386
off the coast of Santa Monica.

38:19.388 --> 38:21.755
The result of firing
its apogee kick motor,

38:21.757 --> 38:24.324
which I thankfully engaged,
although I must say

38:24.326 --> 38:26.793
I was sweating
when I pushed that button.

38:26.795 --> 38:28.327
(laughter)

38:28.329 --> 38:31.396
I pressed the button, too, you know.
(continues indistinctly)

38:31.398 --> 38:33.264
I'm not hearing
about any of us.

38:33.266 --> 38:34.932
Well, she technically
did press a button,

38:34.934 --> 38:35.966
so she's not lying.

38:35.968 --> 38:37.100
Politicians.

38:37.102 --> 38:38.301
Masters of the half truth.

38:38.303 --> 38:39.802
I had higher hopes
for this lady.

38:39.804 --> 38:41.170
ADRIANA: I can't take
all the credit, though.

38:41.172 --> 38:43.338
Homeland is lucky to have a team

38:43.340 --> 38:45.340
of very good scientists
under its umbrella.

38:45.342 --> 38:46.507
They helped, too.

38:54.950 --> 38:57.550
SUPER FUN GUY: Mirth?
You can't handle the mirth.

38:57.552 --> 38:59.184
Toby, I told you before
it's not a toy!

38:59.186 --> 39:00.418
Okay? It's a doll that
operates on batteries.

39:00.420 --> 39:01.986
That's the definition
of a toy.

39:01.988 --> 39:04.121
My Whoopee Cushion of Doom
will blast you to atoms!

39:04.123 --> 39:05.422
(Super Fun Guy farting)
Let me do it!

39:05.424 --> 39:07.457
Okay, children.
Now it's mine.

39:07.459 --> 39:10.193
Glad to be working with
this kind of nonsense again?

39:10.195 --> 39:12.895
I've been working
with actors for weeks.

39:12.897 --> 39:15.330
Trust me, this is a
maturity upgrade.

39:16.900 --> 39:18.032
Kovelsky's, my treat!

39:18.034 --> 39:19.266
We're in.

39:19.268 --> 39:20.500
Paige?
Uh, paperwork.

39:20.502 --> 39:22.034
Boring. Cabe?

39:22.036 --> 39:24.102
On you?
Absolutely.

39:24.104 --> 39:25.803
Walter?
Ooh, no, no, no.

39:25.805 --> 39:27.838
I'm resting.
That's wise.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.840
And the next time
you hold out on me

39:29.842 --> 39:31.808
in regards to your health,
we're gonna have an issue.

39:35.380 --> 39:37.380
Paige told you?

39:37.382 --> 39:39.215
No.

39:41.118 --> 39:45.053
I just know you, kid.

39:48.925 --> 39:51.558
(door opens)

39:53.428 --> 39:55.995
(door closes)

39:55.997 --> 39:57.296
You're, uh...

39:57.298 --> 39:59.398
perturbed?

39:59.400 --> 40:01.299
My new business plan
for Scorpion.

40:01.301 --> 40:02.533
Wondering if it'll ever work.

40:02.535 --> 40:05.269
Well, your-your plan
is just a theory.

40:05.271 --> 40:06.903
Its-its basis
and assumptions

40:06.905 --> 40:08.938
need to be tested
to prove its validity.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.906
Like the microwave EMP.

40:10.908 --> 40:13.074
That was just
a theoretical solution

40:13.076 --> 40:15.209
until we tested it.

40:15.211 --> 40:16.610
I guess.

40:16.612 --> 40:19.412
Or like you and me.

40:19.414 --> 40:22.281
You know, we, um,
we assume

40:22.283 --> 40:24.082
that our perplexing,

40:24.084 --> 40:25.516
uh, feelings...

40:25.518 --> 40:27.351
uh, will interfere
with Scorpion.

40:27.353 --> 40:29.953
So our theory dictates

40:29.955 --> 40:32.454
that we avoid
anything unprofessional.

40:34.191 --> 40:35.590
Right.

40:35.592 --> 40:38.426
Yeah. Right.

40:38.428 --> 40:40.161
Except, you know,

40:40.163 --> 40:42.296
um...

40:42.298 --> 40:44.097
we never really

40:44.099 --> 40:46.365
tested our assumption.

40:46.367 --> 40:48.900
Yeah, I mean, the one
our theory's based on

40:48.902 --> 40:52.203
that we couldn't work together
if we acted on our attraction.

40:52.205 --> 40:54.305
Yep.

41:07.185 --> 41:08.417
Okay, yeah, good.

41:08.419 --> 41:09.951
Well, we tested that theory.

41:09.953 --> 41:11.352
Honestly, I felt nothing. You?

41:11.354 --> 41:12.586
Same.
I'm starting to believe

41:12.588 --> 41:14.087
that m-my attraction to you

41:14.089 --> 41:15.488
is based on the symmetry
of your face,

41:15.490 --> 41:18.491
which is a vestigial
affectation from cavemen.

41:18.493 --> 41:19.658
It meant
that you were free

41:19.660 --> 41:21.993
from genetic malfunctions.

41:21.995 --> 41:24.962
I guess the assumption
of our intense chemistry

41:24.964 --> 41:26.563
was... off.

41:26.565 --> 41:30.333
It can happen
with any hypothesis.

41:30.335 --> 41:32.368
But just to be safe,
we should prob...

41:32.370 --> 41:33.402
Yes, professional colleagues.
See you tomorrow.

41:33.404 --> 41:35.370
Okay, tomorrow.

41:35.372 --> 41:36.404
Good night.
Good night.

41:36.406 --> 41:38.472
Good night.

41:49.417 --> 41:51.483
(exhales)
Oh, boy.
