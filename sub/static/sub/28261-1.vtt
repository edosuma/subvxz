Welcome
to Beacon Heights University..

00:15.182 --> 00:17.267
...where excellence
is not an option.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.353
It's a requirement.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.271
(female #1)
'Don't stay up too late.'

getting in was hard..

...keeping up is even harder.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.928
[thunder rumbling]

00:56.640 --> 00:59.893
At BHU we'll do whatever
it takes to stay on top.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.812
We thrive under pressure.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.939
And strive for perfection.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.650
But no one's perfect.

01:06.650 --> 01:09.653
And the pressure is building
to a breaking point.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.786
And someone is about to snap..

I'm joining the faculty at BHU.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.486

[thunder rumbling]

03:13.944 --> 03:15.529
Mona, what are you doing here?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.697
I work at BHU.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.699
Recruitments and admissions.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.701
- I thought you were in--
- France?

03:21.701 --> 03:23.745
Yeah, that was great
for a while

03:23.745 --> 03:26.873
but eventually the reasons
I was there escaped me

03:26.873 --> 03:29.459
so, I came back to the States
to devote my time

03:29.459 --> 03:32.087
to something that suited
my talents and my passions.

03:32.087 --> 03:34.714
Game design for Hotchkiss.

03:34.714 --> 03:35.715
I'm still not following.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.217
Then, ten months ago

03:37.217 --> 03:38.969
I was hired to help

03:38.969 --> 03:41.972
refine their student
and faculty selection process.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.390
I did.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.642
And I chose you.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.602
You didn't think
of telling me?

03:47.602 --> 03:49.479
Would you have come if I did?

03:49.479 --> 03:51.231
No.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.401
Look, I came here
because I needed a fresh start

03:54.401 --> 03:57.404
and it's a lot easier
to earn people's trust

03:57.404 --> 04:00.282
when you haven't already given
them reasons not to trust you.

04:04.119 --> 04:06.997
Story of my life.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.624
Emily loves me. She just
can't get past the past.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.668
I thought you guys were happy.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.753
We are and then we're not.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.301
Always comes back to trust.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.970
But I'm not giving up.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.764
I want to leave the mean girl
I was in high school behind me.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.019
I really want
to help these kids.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.146
And you will.
I know it.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.195
- What's that?
- That's Beacon Guard.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.988
The school security system.

04:39.988 --> 04:43.366
It's made BHU
the safest campus in Oregon.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.870
Mm, speaking of which, how about
I give you a tour tomorrow?

04:46.870 --> 04:47.954
Don't you have work?

04:47.954 --> 04:49.164
Oh, showing you around

04:49.164 --> 04:50.373
making sure you fit in.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.626
That is my work.

Why don't you put the pie
in the fridge?

04:55.212 --> 04:57.464
You don't want it
to go to waste.

Don't you think?

05:21.071 --> 05:23.323
The Hotchkiss family
really gives back.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.825
I was reading up
on Hotchkiss Technologies.

05:25.825 --> 05:29.829
The family practically built
this place from the ground up.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.832
Taylor was Claire and Peter's
daughter who died, right?

05:32.832 --> 05:34.668
She killed herself a year ago.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.670
The town's only suicide.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.880
She was a lovely person.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.423
Her brother Nolan's
in your class. He's--

05:40.423 --> 05:41.841
Wait, how did you know Taylor

05:41.841 --> 05:43.176
if you only came here
after she died?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.387
I read up on her.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.097
You're living in her house.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.348
- What?
- Don't worry.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.849

06:00.360 --> 06:02.028
Welcome back to school.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.780
Your summer assignment
was to read a book

06:03.780 --> 06:06.866
by one of my favorite authors,
Agatha Christie.

06:06.866 --> 06:10.120
"And Then There Were None"
tackles many complex themes

06:10.120 --> 06:12.205
and I'm interested to see
what you guys think.

06:13.290 --> 06:14.874
Who wants to go first?

06:14.874 --> 06:16.918
[indistinct chatter]

06:16.918 --> 06:19.296
Uh, Dylan Walker.

06:19.296 --> 06:22.257
I was really struck
by the idea of isolation.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.634
I mean, Justice Wargrave
deliberately picks this

06:24.634 --> 06:26.219
remote location,
so the characters

06:26.219 --> 06:27.637
'can't escape themselves,
right?'

06:27.637 --> 06:30.098
Part of their, their punishment.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.100
Incisive. I agree.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.560
Thank you.

06:35.729 --> 06:39.649
Um, Ava Jalali.

06:39.649 --> 06:43.069
Um, I think
Dylan's always right.

06:43.069 --> 06:46.573
[all laughing]
And..

06:46.573 --> 06:49.784
Uh, well, there were some
and then there were none.

06:49.784 --> 06:55.290
So, it's about the dichotomy
between something and nothing.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.292
Wow! Nice try.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.296
I spent the summer
growing my YouTube channel.

07:01.296 --> 07:04.257
That's how I pay for tuition.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.594
I get it. But you're gonna have
to come to class more prepared.

07:07.594 --> 07:11.348
Of course. Won't happen again.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.350
Caitlin Lewis.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.976
The author wasn't subtle.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.479
She names a character "Justice."

07:17.479 --> 07:19.147
It comes down to..

07:19.147 --> 07:23.026
Well, is it okay
to murder a murderer?

07:23.026 --> 07:24.986
Interesting.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.321
Do you think it is?

07:26.321 --> 07:27.989
If somebody hurt someone
I loved.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.783
Yeah, I'd hurt him back.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.951
Well, don't worry
about me, babe.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.161
No one's gonna mess with me.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.000
Nolan Hotchkiss.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.127
What do you think of the book?

07:41.127 --> 07:43.630
Payback's a bitch.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.466
Characters got
what they deserved.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.884
They did terrible things

07:47.884 --> 07:50.553
and they got terrible things
done to them.

07:50.553 --> 07:54.307
I thought you'd appreciate that
world view, Ms. DiLaurentis.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.658
Excuse me, Nolan.

I know about payback?

My mother's gonna say
to you that

08:17.247 --> 08:19.416
you're here because
you remind me of my sister.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.514

08:34.514 --> 08:36.349
Well, I'm already coming
to your mom's

Welcome Back To School party and
I told you I have plans tonight.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.354
Then cancel them.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.732
You know how much I hate
being alone with them.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.108
Yeah.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.609
I can't imagine anything
that's more important

08:46.609 --> 08:48.611
to you than showin' up for me.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.780
Can I?

08:50.780 --> 08:52.949
Alright, yeah,
I'll-I'll be there.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.576
Oh, Dylan, same arrangement
as last year.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.745
You'll do the papers
for Ava and me.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.414
Uh, I can, I can cover yours

08:59.414 --> 09:00.915
but I can't do Ava's work.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.546
I'm tryin' out for
a summer symphony chair.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.964
Dylan, that's awesome.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.716
That's everything you've ever
worked for.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.259
Don't worry about
my paper, Nolan, it'd fine--

09:11.259 --> 09:16.306
Ava. You are the smartest guy
I know.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.224
You'll figure it out.
You always do.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.934
- Don't be late.
- Mm.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.147
I have to get to class.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.401
Really thought things would be
different this year.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.780
Why, because of Taylor?

09:31.780 --> 09:34.949
You were there, I mean, you-you
even cried at her funeral.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.994
Dylan, um, whatever
Nolan has on you

09:37.994 --> 09:39.454
if there's anything
I could do to help.

09:39.454 --> 09:42.248
We're just fake friends,
alright.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.500
We just hang out
to make it look like

09:43.500 --> 09:45.585
he has the perfect posse.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.086
So, what, we just don't talk
to each other

09:47.086 --> 09:48.630
when Nolan's not around?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.092
You know what, I got to go.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.011
I just found out I have
three papers to write.

Oh, Jesus! What?

10:12.111 --> 10:15.031
- Nolan Hotchkiss.
- What about him?

10:15.031 --> 10:17.659
Wasn't it like two hours ago
we were being all summer camp

10:17.659 --> 10:20.119
talking about
fresh starts and trust?

10:20.119 --> 10:22.956
So, then who else did you tell
about my background?

10:22.956 --> 10:26.793
You know, just so I don't
get any more surprises.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.628
What did Nolan say?

10:28.628 --> 10:30.630
You know what? Never mind.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.049
I didn't tell anyone.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.301
Especially Nolan.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.804
He's super smart.
But he doesn't belong here.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.472
How so?

10:39.472 --> 10:41.307
[sighs]

10:41.307 --> 10:45.353
By my calculations
he could be dangerous.

with their homework.

lit papers.

- That can get you expelled.
- I offered.

that they needed to finish.

Saying "Yes" to us
was the best decision

12:48.935 --> 12:51.187
I've ever made. But I--

12:51.187 --> 12:53.982
When I came to college
I promised myself

12:53.982 --> 12:56.526
that I wasn't gonna get serious
about anybody.

Alright,
but the day that I met you

Thank you.

[indistinct chatter]

26:16.158 --> 26:17.493
Hey.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.495
- I read your paper.
- Oh.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.330
Your insights were quite
provocative.

26:21.330 --> 26:22.748
Thank you.

26:22.748 --> 26:23.999
I was so intrigued that
I actually took

26:23.999 --> 26:25.584
a look at your file.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.794
You're gonna take your
mom senate seat

26:26.794 --> 26:28.420
when she runs for president?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.422
That's the plan.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.799
Well, thanks for your work.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.592
I'm opposed to
capital punishment

26:33.592 --> 26:37.304
but you almost made me believe
murder could be justified.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.847
Maybe I was a little
too inspired

26:38.847 --> 26:41.016
by my own fantasy
to get rid of someone.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.518
[laughs]

26:42.518 --> 26:43.769
Kidding.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.105
Is your fantasy about Nolan?

26:49.107 --> 26:51.485
I saw the two of you arguing.

26:51.485 --> 26:53.278
You saw somebody else.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.280
We're totally happy together.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.950
Are you lying because
you're afraid of him?

26:57.950 --> 26:59.493
Because I can help.

26:59.493 --> 27:00.786
You'll just make
everything worse

27:00.786 --> 27:03.539
if you start asking questions.

27:03.539 --> 27:08.126
Look, I know a little bit
about manipulation.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.295
I used to be like Nolan.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.798
So, I can help you
if you just let me..

27:12.798 --> 27:14.967
You don't get it.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.344
He'll do whatever it takes to
make sure his mother continues

27:17.344 --> 27:20.138
to think that he's her
perfect son.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.849
Including pretending that
you're his girlfriend

27:21.849 --> 27:23.517
when he's actually
interested in Ava?

27:29.565 --> 27:31.316
Uh..

27:31.316 --> 27:32.693
I'm.. I gotta go.

27:34.236 --> 27:35.654

28:39.801 --> 28:41.219

28:42.888 --> 28:44.431
She's ordered surveillance on me

28:44.431 --> 28:45.974
and she'll be watchin' Ava too.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.562
We need to meet.

28:54.316 --> 28:56.818
I looked at some of your
previous writing.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.737
'It's your gift for words
that gave you away.'

28:58.737 --> 29:01.657
It's kinda what it takes
to make it here, right?

29:01.657 --> 29:04.076
I know about Nolan and Ava.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.827
'Is he manipulating you..'

29:05.827 --> 29:08.580
...forcing you to write
their papers?

29:08.580 --> 29:10.582
'What does he have on you?'

29:10.582 --> 29:12.084
Why did you take business ethics

29:12.084 --> 29:15.587
if you're so uninterested in it?

29:15.587 --> 29:17.756
I thought it would give me
something to talk about

29:17.756 --> 29:19.091

29:24.763 --> 29:28.016
It's cool
that you guys do that.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.102
I wish my family
didn't live so far away.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.606
You have Andrew.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.192
That's still a thing, right?

29:37.192 --> 29:40.278
Yeah, he's moving in next week.
We are exclusive now.

29:41.989 --> 29:45.200
Sounds limiting.
I'm surprise you agreed to it.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.202
It was my idea, alright?

29:49.121 --> 29:50.622
So you and I are gonna hook up

29:50.622 --> 29:52.457
we should do it sooner
rather than later

29:52.457 --> 29:53.792
before he moves in.

29:55.836 --> 29:58.380
I thought that you and I
were just...friends.

when you think I'm not watching.

and I'm bored of you.

that easy.

We push him off the roof.

to think about dying

on those spikes at the bottom.
