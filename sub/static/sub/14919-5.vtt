00:07.654 --> 00:08.934
Ooh, hello.

00:09.562 --> 00:10.139
Hey.

00:10.140 --> 00:13.528
You look amazing. You're all glowing.

00:13.529 --> 00:14.522
Yeah. It's nothing.

00:15.327 --> 00:16.589
Oh, no. It's not nothing.

00:16.590 --> 00:17.945
It's something,

00:17.946 --> 00:21.442
something pretty spectacular.

00:21.443 --> 00:22.306
Thank you.

00:23.087 --> 00:25.033
Um... you know, honey,

00:25.034 --> 00:27.244
I don't really have anything planned.

00:27.267 --> 00:29.517
- If you wanted to take the morning...
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:29.518 --> 00:31.134
- What? What?
- Don't, don't, please.

00:32.694 --> 00:33.721
What's that smell?

00:33.722 --> 00:37.130
- Nothing. It's an airbrush
bronzing system. It's...
- A spray tan?

00:37.131 --> 00:38.790
- Yeah.
- You just did a spray tan?

00:38.791 --> 00:40.717
Don't mock me, okay? My agent will kill me

00:40.718 --> 00:42.421
if I show up to this
go-see with some streaks,

00:42.422 --> 00:44.587
- so please, no touching.
- No streaks. No touching.

00:44.588 --> 00:45.962
Okay. Okay.

00:46.752 --> 00:48.816
Okay. Go see, be seen.

00:49.319 --> 00:50.312
I hope it's worth it.

00:52.041 --> 00:53.227
I'm sorry it's been so busy lately

00:53.228 --> 00:55.229
with meeting, photo shoot.

00:56.231 --> 00:59.126
Honey, do you want to do
something romantic tonight,

00:59.186 --> 01:00.354
just the two of us?

01:01.298 --> 01:02.274
Of course, yeah.

01:03.317 --> 01:06.329
Okay. Okay. I will organize it.

01:06.330 --> 01:08.538
I gotta go. I'm late.

01:09.191 --> 01:10.087
Love you.

01:11.235 --> 01:13.742
That's what it all comes down to, Francie,

01:13.743 --> 01:16.254
self-esteem, self-esteem.

01:16.782 --> 01:19.390
All right, all you radio land peop... 

01:19.391 --> 01:22.809
okay, lovely listeners, stick with me.

01:22.810 --> 01:26.335
I'll be right back after
a word from my sponsor.

01:26.336 --> 01:29.310
- If you've been dreaming
about installing a garage...
- Mom.

01:29.311 --> 01:30.176
Oh!

01:31.646 --> 01:33.632
God, you scared me to death.

01:34.106 --> 01:35.253
What are you doing?

01:35.254 --> 01:36.006
Nothing.

01:36.083 --> 01:38.675
Nothing? Who were you talking to?

01:39.497 --> 01:41.277
No one. I wasn't talking to anyone.

01:41.278 --> 01:42.813
Um, really? That's funny.

01:42.814 --> 01:44.974
'Cause I think I just heard you talking.

01:44.999 --> 01:46.417
All right. Okay.

01:46.418 --> 01:49.177
I... I... I was... I was practicing.

01:49.178 --> 01:51.744
I have an audition today
at the radio station.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.006
What? Is that happening?

01:53.127 --> 01:54.461
- Yes, that's happening.
- What?

01:54.462 --> 01:58.142
Yeah. They're gonna
call the show "Dear mom,"

01:58.143 --> 01:59.557
and I might be the mom.

01:59.558 --> 02:02.034
Mom, that's... that's... 
congratulations. That's awesome.

02:02.380 --> 02:03.596
Why do they want you again?

02:04.006 --> 02:06.247
- Justin.
- I'm kidding. You're gonna be amazing.

02:06.324 --> 02:09.842
Well, the producer wants the host to be

02:09.847 --> 02:12.769
a real mom with real mothering know-how.

02:12.770 --> 02:15.750
Now I may not have a lot of
experience in the workplace,

02:15.751 --> 02:17.878
but listening to people's problems,

02:17.879 --> 02:19.637
helping them sort themselves out,

02:19.638 --> 02:23.111
that I have experience with,
that I can do... yes, you can.

02:23.303 --> 02:24.454
- Can't I?
- Yes, you can.

02:24.522 --> 02:26.586
So ask me something. Just ask me anything.

02:28.049 --> 02:29.026
Okay.

02:29.341 --> 02:33.007
How long after I eat can I go swimming?

02:33.877 --> 02:36.029
- Oh, come on. Be serious.
- What? What?

02:36.030 --> 02:38.629
- What's bothering you?
- Nothing's bothering me. I'm fine.

02:38.630 --> 02:41.495
Then why are you here
at 7:30 in the morning?

02:42.169 --> 02:45.284
Okay. I guess I'm having a little trouble

02:45.285 --> 02:46.389
since Rebecca left.

02:46.410 --> 02:48.331
I can't sleep.

02:48.422 --> 02:50.257
I wake up every morning and go for a run,

02:50.258 --> 02:53.426
but it feels like no no
matter how much I run,

02:53.427 --> 02:54.530
I still can't sleep.

02:54.748 --> 02:57.341
Oh, sweetheart. I had no idea.

02:57.342 --> 02:58.814
Why didn't you tell me?

02:58.825 --> 02:59.898
I'm gonna call the radio station... 

02:59.899 --> 03:01.141
- No, no. Oh, mom... come on.
- And have them push this thing... 

03:01.142 --> 03:02.703
No, no, no. Look, look... here, here.

03:02.704 --> 03:06.068
Practice. Right? Pretend
I'm just some call-in guest.

03:06.069 --> 03:08.326
All right? So give me this. Practice.

03:08.433 --> 03:09.393
Shoot.

03:11.078 --> 03:12.263
Running is good.

03:13.078 --> 03:14.371
Running is very good.

03:14.372 --> 03:18.293
It helps... it helps keep you fit
while you're... while... while... 

03:18.577 --> 03:20.482
life is not a piece of cake.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.920
Cake is good.

03:23.275 --> 03:26.642
Try a slice of cake and
a glass of milk at bed.

03:26.643 --> 03:28.686
It works every ti... and you know what?

03:28.762 --> 03:31.310
- I happen to have some cake.
- Wow.

03:31.398 --> 03:34.447
Chocolate. I think I
will just wrap this up,

03:34.696 --> 03:38.417
- and you can take it home
with you. There you go.
- Mom, you're...

03:38.418 --> 03:39.277
really, that's great advice.

03:39.278 --> 03:41.733
- You're gonna be fantastic.
- Do you want some milk with that?

03:41.734 --> 03:43.617
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

03:48.947 --> 03:50.449
What is going on with you?

03:50.570 --> 03:51.738
I'm having coffee.

03:52.408 --> 03:54.781
That's not what I mean. You
didn't come to bed last night.

03:54.782 --> 03:56.026
Oh, well, in case you hadn't noticed,

03:56.027 --> 03:57.721
I'm the only lawyer in my firm.

03:57.722 --> 04:00.394
- I don't even have a secretary yet.
- You're working too hard.

04:00.395 --> 04:01.774
I've barely seen you in the last two days.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.527
Well, I'm on a losing streak,
but I'm gonna turn that around.

04:05.238 --> 04:06.343
You know, before, it was all about

04:06.344 --> 04:08.169
helping rich people keep their money,

04:08.170 --> 04:12.287
but telling a squillionaire that
he can't afford a second yacht

04:12.288 --> 04:14.653
isn't exactly the same as
telling someone with a disability

04:14.654 --> 04:18.055
- he's not gonna get his benefits.
- You haven't lost all your cases.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.997
True. I did tell a fifth
grader he didn't have to go back

04:19.998 --> 04:22.161
to his drunken, abusive
parents. That felt good.

04:22.162 --> 04:25.386
You know, so much of what I do
seems to boil down to the fact

04:25.406 --> 04:27.541
that someone who shouldn't
have had kids had kids.

04:27.542 --> 04:29.809
It's awful, and it's
completely unfair to the kids.

04:29.810 --> 04:31.457
It's unfair to us. We can't go out

04:31.458 --> 04:33.279
and get drunk and knock each
other up on a first date.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.350
We have to spend thousands
of dollars on a surrogate,

04:35.351 --> 04:37.563
- and we still wind up where we started.
- You know,

04:37.682 --> 04:40.549
we could probably afford to
try again if that's something... 

04:40.550 --> 04:44.553
Now? Scotty, I am so busy,
I'd neglect you and the kid.

04:44.554 --> 04:47.378
Look, I'm... I'm just
ranting. I got a phone call.

04:47.546 --> 04:49.046
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

04:49.047 --> 04:51.218
Promise me you won't work too hard.

04:51.307 --> 04:52.445
Come to bed tonight. I miss you.

04:52.446 --> 04:54.299
As soon as my head hits
the pillow, I'll be asleep.

04:54.300 --> 04:58.283
Uh... that isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

05:00.814 --> 05:01.934
Mm.

05:01.939 --> 05:03.185
We're home.

05:04.369 --> 05:06.178
I can't believe I made it.

05:06.502 --> 05:08.974
What, are you kidding? I
could barely keep up with you.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.159
Yeah, well... 

05:10.270 --> 05:12.326
they don't call me "Turbo" for nothing.

05:12.327 --> 05:15.693
Yeah, well, I've seen
grown men in tears... 

05:15.694 --> 05:16.961
before that first mile marker.

05:16.962 --> 05:19.121
- I am impressed.
- Oh, me, too.

05:19.622 --> 05:21.750
You know, I don't think I've
been on my feet that long

05:21.751 --> 05:24.392
since I went to the last
Barneys warehouse sale.

05:24.393 --> 05:25.753
Yeah, well, at least at the end of this,

05:25.754 --> 05:27.224
we had a gorgeous view

05:27.225 --> 05:29.225
- instead of a credit card bill.
- Yeah, but I wish

05:29.226 --> 05:31.712
we didn't have to hike
so far up there to see it.

05:31.713 --> 05:34.146
I mean, at least at Barneys,
they send you the bill.

05:38.538 --> 05:40.462
I don't think I can feel my legs.

05:40.843 --> 05:41.708
Huh.

05:41.748 --> 05:43.155
That is so weird... 

05:44.691 --> 05:46.274
'cause I definitely can.

05:52.658 --> 05:55.506
Mm. You know, I should
probably take a shower.

05:55.536 --> 05:56.704
Well, I could join you.

05:57.530 --> 05:59.674
You know, conserve water.

06:00.622 --> 06:01.534
Kitty.

06:01.871 --> 06:03.549
Kitty. What... 

06:05.175 --> 06:07.370
Oh, uh, hello. Hey.

06:07.371 --> 06:10.541
I'm, uh, I'm Justin, Kitty's brother.

06:10.542 --> 06:12.650
Who's here. Uh, were you
guys just working out?

06:12.651 --> 06:13.645
We were hiking. Oh, yeah, hiking.

06:13.646 --> 06:17.238
Hiking, oh. Well, um, I had the day free,

06:17.239 --> 06:19.414
so I figured I would drive up and... 

06:19.415 --> 06:20.584
And visit me.

06:21.198 --> 06:21.982
Yeah.

06:23.382 --> 06:24.775
- Is that a problem?
- No.

06:24.871 --> 06:26.594
No, not at all. No, no, no.

06:26.595 --> 06:29.641
Good, 'cause, you know, I...
I really wanted to see you

06:29.642 --> 06:32.176
and... and Evan today, and... I'm sorry.

06:32.177 --> 06:33.789
I'm... I'm... I'm going through a breakup.

06:34.093 --> 06:37.085
No, a divorce. A divorce,
actually. A divorce, yeah.

06:37.086 --> 06:38.322
Look, I... I don't want to interrupt you.

06:38.323 --> 06:40.041
- I can come back...
- No, no, you know what? No. No.

06:40.042 --> 06:41.306
We were just about to... 

06:42.677 --> 06:43.972
uh, make lunch.

06:43.973 --> 06:45.334
Do you want... do you want... stay.

06:46.704 --> 06:47.329
Really?

06:47.330 --> 06:48.566
- Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

06:48.567 --> 06:50.761
Oh, thank you. I'm really
sorry about your wife, man.

06:50.762 --> 06:53.205
Oh. Uh, but I brought
some fish that I caught.

06:53.206 --> 06:55.278
- Why don't I, uh, get that started?
- Yeah.

06:55.279 --> 06:57.917
- Thank you.
- He, uh, caught the fish.

06:57.918 --> 07:01.001
- He caught some fish.
- So wait. 

07:01.002 --> 07:02.953
Tell me, is that... is
that the famous Jack?

07:03.142 --> 07:05.208
Please, Justin. He's not famous.

07:05.209 --> 07:07.161
Are... are you sure you're
cool with me being... 

07:07.162 --> 07:09.925
- like, are you guys, like...
- No, no, no, no.

07:09.926 --> 07:12.621
Oh. There is nothing
going on. We're friends.

07:12.622 --> 07:15.980
Well, thank you, 'cause I
could really use the company.

07:15.981 --> 07:17.980
Of course. Always. Anytime.

07:19.741 --> 07:20.525
I'm gonna... 

07:20.526 --> 07:22.186
Hey, uh, Jack, you need a hand in there?

07:26.933 --> 07:28.377
Thanks for coming in, Nora.

07:28.378 --> 07:30.031
And the muffins... 

07:30.430 --> 07:33.262
Wow. You really are the perfect mom.

07:33.277 --> 07:35.368
Well, I'm... I'm so excited to be here.

07:35.369 --> 07:37.370
So what do you want me to do?

07:37.371 --> 07:38.841
Well, it's really very simple.

07:38.842 --> 07:41.387
Uh, we're going to do a sample show.

07:41.572 --> 07:42.858
We'll put you on the air,

07:42.859 --> 07:44.951
- and... on the... on the...
- On the air today?

07:44.952 --> 07:48.606
People will call in,
ask mom-type questions,

07:48.625 --> 07:49.765
- and you'll answer them.
- Okay.

07:49.766 --> 07:50.662
Can you handle it?

07:50.758 --> 07:54.137
Yeah. Uh, yes, I can. I
can. I've got five kids.

07:54.138 --> 07:55.994
I've been training for this my whole life.

07:57.142 --> 07:57.967
There is just... 

07:57.968 --> 08:00.578
one slight hiccup.

08:01.214 --> 08:04.349
Look, if it was up to me,
the job would be yours.

08:04.350 --> 08:07.498
But the, uh, station
guys want to think about

08:07.499 --> 08:10.298
maybe going a different way.

08:11.222 --> 08:12.085
Oh.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.101
What different way?

08:14.102 --> 08:18.166
Well, they've called in
Alexandra Kirby as well.

08:19.699 --> 08:20.850
Oh, my God.

08:20.892 --> 08:21.999
Dr. Alex?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.602
- Oh, so you've heard of her?
- Oh, my God, yes. I'm... I'm a fan.

08:24.603 --> 08:27.313
I've read all her books,
I... I follow her on Twitter.

08:27.314 --> 08:30.225
Oh, heavens. I'm so sorry I'm late.

08:30.342 --> 08:31.463
Kent, be a dear.

08:31.834 --> 08:34.251
This is the last kind of first
impression I want to make.

08:34.253 --> 08:35.933
It's just with running the charity,

08:35.934 --> 08:37.996
and shopping for my
grand-baby's birthday,

08:37.998 --> 08:39.684
and the book tour, I'm simply swamped.

08:39.686 --> 08:43.321
- Oh, where are my manners?
You must be Nora Walker.
- Yes, hello.

08:43.322 --> 08:44.494
I have to tell you,

08:44.495 --> 08:47.103
my assistant has been
googling you all morning.

08:47.117 --> 08:49.935
You are keeping a low profile, lady.

08:50.380 --> 08:52.118
- God, I wish I could do that.
- Well...

08:52.119 --> 08:53.981
The grass is always greener, right?

08:53.982 --> 08:57.198
- Oh, come here, you. Oh.
- Oh! I guess so.

08:57.442 --> 09:00.058
Yes. I'm so excited to have a challenge.

09:00.059 --> 09:02.762
People are usually too scared to
even compete with me, you know?

09:03.118 --> 09:05.146
Oh, this is gonna be a
fun day, don't you think?

09:05.147 --> 09:08.107
Oh, fun day, really fun.

09:08.556 --> 09:09.868
Fun day.

09:17.702 --> 09:20.521
Okay. So what are you
thinking for dessert?

09:20.522 --> 09:21.741
You could go crazy

09:21.742 --> 09:24.670
and do a heart-shaped
strawberry torte kind of thing.

09:25.049 --> 09:25.794
I don't really think

09:25.795 --> 09:29.075
I'm a heart-shaped
strawberry torte kind of gal.

09:29.872 --> 09:32.322
Then again, you know what?
Let's go with the torte.

09:32.323 --> 09:35.200
I want this picnic to be really romantic.

09:35.201 --> 09:38.568
I'm trying to reenact
our... our first date.

09:38.569 --> 09:42.434
Oh, that is so sweet. Um,
uh, let me get you a recipe.

09:42.898 --> 09:44.377
I hope I'm not in the way here.

09:44.378 --> 09:45.436
No, no, it's fine.

09:46.123 --> 09:48.682
Scotty, have you ever had a spray tan?

09:49.831 --> 09:50.950
Excuse me?

09:51.543 --> 09:55.114
Just... a weird thing happened
this morning with me and Luc.

09:55.115 --> 09:58.843
- Weird how?
- No, in-the-bedroom weird, between us.

09:58.862 --> 10:01.053
You know, he didn't want to do it.

10:01.178 --> 10:04.016
Oh. Well, you know, that's... normal.

10:04.017 --> 10:05.171
Every couple goes through that.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.353
I mean, I'm sure it's not that bad.

10:07.354 --> 10:09.374
It's not like it's been weeks or anything.

10:11.101 --> 10:12.695
Oh, or, you know, even if it has been... 

10:12.696 --> 10:13.765
Do you think weeks is a long time?

10:13.766 --> 10:16.549
No, you guys are busy with kids and lives,

10:16.550 --> 10:18.362
and there are plenty of reasons.

10:18.363 --> 10:20.414
It's not like he's
getting it anywhere else.

10:20.415 --> 10:22.461
You think he's getting it somewhere else?

10:22.462 --> 10:24.265
Stop it, Sarah. You're making me nervous.

10:24.266 --> 10:26.113
You're making me nervous.

10:26.594 --> 10:27.541
Don't do this.

10:27.914 --> 10:29.145
Luc loves you.

10:30.274 --> 10:32.271
I know, but I mean, maybe you're right.

10:32.272 --> 10:34.113
He... he does stay out late a lot.

10:34.114 --> 10:37.518
He says it's for work, but work
these days for... for Luc is,

10:37.519 --> 10:40.030
you know, parties and spray tans.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.020
Sarah, sometimes a spray
tan is just a spray tan.

10:44.255 --> 10:45.262
Okay?

10:45.651 --> 10:46.467
Yeah.

10:47.594 --> 10:49.366
I mean, and I'm trying
not to think about her,

10:49.367 --> 10:51.285
but, like, on the way up here,

10:51.286 --> 10:55.030
there's this date shake place,
which was, like, our place.

10:55.199 --> 10:57.504
But I couldn't bring myself to go in.

10:57.562 --> 10:59.418
Yeah, I get it, man.

10:59.958 --> 11:03.957
Facing it... it's like a really cold lake.

11:04.113 --> 11:05.297
You just gotta jump.

11:05.515 --> 11:07.450
The water is never as
cold as you think it is.

11:09.056 --> 11:10.270
Easier said than done.

11:10.979 --> 11:13.282
But hey, thanks for letting me vent.

11:14.267 --> 11:16.286
So what, you... you
caught these fish yourself?

11:16.910 --> 11:18.269
Yeah. Yesterday.

11:18.270 --> 11:19.774
- You want to try?
- Yeah.

11:19.867 --> 11:22.342
All right, well, first you
gotta slice open their belly.

11:22.343 --> 11:24.174
Okay. All right. Go ahead.

11:24.978 --> 11:26.754
- Just get right in there?
- Just hold it down.

11:26.785 --> 11:28.961
Ugh. Justin, don't you think

11:28.962 --> 11:30.673
you should let Jack
concentrate on the fish

11:30.674 --> 11:33.010
so we could eat one of these
days, and maybe we could

11:33.011 --> 11:35.730
get you back on the road
before it's way too late?

11:35.936 --> 11:38.078
Are you kidding me? This
is exactly what I needed.

11:38.538 --> 11:41.258
Have you, uh, have you
talked to Kitty, too?

11:41.954 --> 11:42.994
About what?

11:43.559 --> 11:44.614
About Robert?

11:45.250 --> 11:46.979
I mean, he gives great advice.

11:47.103 --> 11:49.773
Um... uh, no, no.

11:49.774 --> 11:51.043
Actually, Justin... 

11:51.690 --> 11:54.129
We don't really talk
about Robert very much.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.778
Well, tell her... tell her about the lake.

11:55.779 --> 11:58.737
Uh, I don't think Kitty really
wants to hear that one right now.

11:59.924 --> 12:01.970
You know what? I should
probably go get cleaned up.

12:06.656 --> 12:07.885
Did I say something wrong?

12:07.886 --> 12:09.806
No, it's... it's... 

12:10.985 --> 12:13.910
we're a little bit more than friends.

12:15.911 --> 12:16.713
Oh.

12:16.714 --> 12:18.192
Before you start to judge me

12:18.193 --> 12:20.212
and start to say that this
is all too soon or whatever,

12:20.213 --> 12:24.099
you just have to understand
that... that being with Jack is... 

12:24.165 --> 12:27.069
is the first thing that's made
me not think about Robert so much.

12:27.070 --> 12:28.902
- And the accident was,
like, what, a year ago?
- It's great.

12:28.903 --> 12:32.069
And I think that it... what did you say?

12:32.214 --> 12:34.581
It's great. I think he's great.

12:35.014 --> 12:38.214
And the best part is, is he's
not even remotely your type.

12:38.651 --> 12:40.262
Well, what do you mean, he's not my type?

12:40.263 --> 12:42.505
Kitty, I don't think
this guy has seen a suit,

12:42.506 --> 12:43.830
- let alone worn one.
- Well...

12:43.831 --> 12:46.363
I mean, is he a democrat or a republican?

12:46.958 --> 12:48.085
I don't know. I don't
have the foggiest idea.

12:48.086 --> 12:51.718
Exactly, not your type.
But congratulations.

12:51.778 --> 12:52.914
You just jumped.

12:54.918 --> 12:56.055
Where are you going?

12:56.174 --> 12:58.511
I'm gonna go so you guys can... 

12:59.406 --> 13:00.213
have lunch.

13:00.214 --> 13:03.334
Oh, just... just... just stay and eat.

13:03.335 --> 13:05.702
No, no, no. Thank you, but, um... 

13:07.599 --> 13:09.312
I think I'm in the mood for a shake.

13:16.598 --> 13:18.938
Okay, it's about an hour till airtime.

13:18.939 --> 13:19.522
Okay.

13:19.523 --> 13:20.233
You know the drill?

13:20.234 --> 13:23.519
Yes. Um, I'm gonna answer
questions for about two hours,

13:23.520 --> 13:26.342
and then Dr. Alex will answer questions

13:26.343 --> 13:29.239
for about two hour... are you
sure you want me to go first?

13:29.597 --> 13:30.828
Are you kidding?

13:31.039 --> 13:33.808
Uh, do you really want to follow Dr. Alex?

13:33.809 --> 13:35.578
No, I don't want to follow Dr. Alex.

13:35.635 --> 13:36.970
I don't want to do that.

13:36.971 --> 13:38.866
As long as you can find some time

13:38.867 --> 13:42.913
to get your point of view out,
you still have a shot, Nora.

13:43.695 --> 13:45.141
Okay, I can do that.

13:45.142 --> 13:48.077
There you are, you rascal.
You been hiding from me?

13:48.078 --> 13:50.646
No, no, Alexandra. Wh... what's going on?

13:50.647 --> 13:52.236
Oh, good. Nora's here, too.

13:52.237 --> 13:54.049
This concerns you as well, darlin'.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.973
Now I know we all agreed
to this 2-shift scheme

13:56.974 --> 13:58.445
of yours, Frank, but I talked to

13:58.446 --> 14:00.754
the station execs upstairs,
and we all thought,

14:00.762 --> 14:04.090
wouldn't it be so much more fun
if we went on the air together?

14:04.091 --> 14:04.923
Oh.

14:06.454 --> 14:09.892
Uh, don't they need to
evaluate us individually?

14:09.916 --> 14:11.630
Oh, pish. I'm sure they'll be able to tell

14:11.631 --> 14:13.008
which way the wind is blowing.

14:13.318 --> 14:15.638
Oh, come on. What do you say, Nora... 

14:15.770 --> 14:17.274
a 2-mom smackdown?

14:17.771 --> 14:19.979
A smackdown? A smackdown.

14:20.602 --> 14:23.099
I... I don't think I have the
right shoes for a smackdown.

14:24.473 --> 14:26.649
Oh, you are so funny!

14:26.859 --> 14:28.522
So what do you say, Frank, are we on?

14:28.869 --> 14:29.593
I guess.

14:29.594 --> 14:31.849
Oh, great. Looking forward to it.

14:31.850 --> 14:35.225
Yay. I'll go find out what's going on.

14:35.226 --> 14:35.930
Okay.

14:43.338 --> 14:45.358
Kevin, I don't know where
you are or what you're doing,

14:45.359 --> 14:46.478
but I need you.

14:46.787 --> 14:48.354
I'm about to get smacked.

14:55.738 --> 14:56.474
Hey!

14:56.943 --> 14:58.809
Kevin, where have you been?

14:58.810 --> 15:01.596
What? Some kind of entourage you are.

15:01.597 --> 15:02.777
We're about ready to go on.

15:02.778 --> 15:06.074
- Okay. How are you feeling, confident?
- No. God, no.

15:06.356 --> 15:08.611
I can't go up against Dr. Alex.

15:08.612 --> 15:10.882
- I can't do that, Kevin.
- Okay, okay, mom,

15:10.982 --> 15:12.997
you're the underdog, no question about it,

15:12.998 --> 15:14.489
but that might be an advantage.

15:14.490 --> 15:15.949
This is all about likability.

15:15.950 --> 15:18.670
If there's one thing America
likes, it's an underdog.

15:23.198 --> 15:24.686
I'm not ready. I can't do this.

15:24.687 --> 15:26.314
- I'm not ready.
- Are you kidding me?

15:26.315 --> 15:28.858
You're Nora Walker.
You're ready for anything.

15:29.445 --> 15:30.173
Good.

15:30.174 --> 15:30.957
Okay. Now get out there

15:30.958 --> 15:32.742
and show 'em what you got.

15:34.116 --> 15:35.492
You never saw "Rocky"?

15:37.000 --> 15:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:52.727 --> 15:54.150
All right. One date shake.

15:54.171 --> 15:55.828
I can do this. All right. Come on.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.559
It's not a problem.
It's just a date shake.

15:58.086 --> 15:59.045
What can I get ya?

16:00.046 --> 16:02.105
Um, one, uh, date shake.

16:02.106 --> 16:04.853
Coming right up. Can you
just give me a second?

16:04.854 --> 16:06.406
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. No hurries.

16:08.386 --> 16:10.130
So who you talking to back there?

16:10.142 --> 16:11.613
Got an imaginary friend?

16:12.066 --> 16:13.266
Oh, my God. You heard that.

16:14.595 --> 16:16.835
Sorry. I couldn't help but notice.

16:16.878 --> 16:19.614
We don't get a lot of cute guys
strolling up here alone, so... 

16:22.254 --> 16:23.807
I'm gonna go get you that shake.

16:24.335 --> 16:25.839
How much is it, actually?

16:26.134 --> 16:28.721
You know... it's on the house.

16:29.002 --> 16:31.161
Consider it a kind
gesture from a stranger.

16:31.367 --> 16:33.206
You look like you could use one, so... 

16:33.579 --> 16:35.675
Uh, th... thank you. You
didn't have to do that.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.108
So what's wrong?

16:39.191 --> 16:41.405
Um, nothing. I... I... I don't know.

16:41.406 --> 16:44.453
I was just, you know, driving,
trying to clear my head,

16:44.454 --> 16:47.049
- get out of the city.
- Bad breakup?

16:47.050 --> 16:48.878
Yeah. God, am I that obvious?

16:48.879 --> 16:50.719
No, I just know the feeling.

16:51.710 --> 16:54.046
Sometimes you gotta
just move on, you know?

16:56.335 --> 16:57.119
Hey... 

16:57.846 --> 16:59.286
Are you in town for a while?

17:00.057 --> 17:03.254
Uh, I was actually here. I'm
on my way back down to the city.

17:03.255 --> 17:04.868
It's just, I get off in a couple of hours,

17:04.869 --> 17:06.750
and there is a bar down the street,

17:06.751 --> 17:09.583
and a great band is playing
tonight, and really good beer.

17:09.845 --> 17:10.790
Do you wanna come?

17:11.445 --> 17:13.925
Um, well, I don't drink, but, uh... 

17:16.809 --> 17:18.010
I... I love music.

17:18.369 --> 17:19.987
Yeah, sure. I'd love to.

17:20.011 --> 17:20.912
Great.

17:21.790 --> 17:22.655
Great.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.786
Well, I will get you that shake.

17:25.106 --> 17:26.385
- Date shake, your...
- Yeah.

17:26.386 --> 17:27.603
Yeah, that's your... 

17:31.094 --> 17:33.234
Today we have a special show for you... 

17:33.235 --> 17:36.957
"Dear mom homespun
advice for better living."

17:36.958 --> 17:40.030
We have two moms, so don't hold back.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.655
They'll both be serving
up their brand of apple pie

17:42.844 --> 17:44.219
just for you.

17:44.290 --> 17:46.754
To my right I have Nora Walker.

17:48.022 --> 17:49.341
Oh, that's... that's my turn.

17:49.342 --> 17:51.682
Okay, um, hi.

17:51.902 --> 17:54.030
I'm Nora Walker.

17:54.346 --> 17:57.954
I... I'm a homemaker from Pasadena,

17:58.045 --> 18:00.402
uh, the mother of... of five... 

18:01.786 --> 18:03.049
and a cook.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.615
Well, I'm... I'm not a professional cook,

18:05.616 --> 18:07.393
but I do make the chocolate cheesecake

18:07.394 --> 18:10.788
- for my son-in-law's restaurant.
- Great.

18:10.806 --> 18:12.481
- Thank you, Nora.
- Okay.

18:12.482 --> 18:13.965
And to my left,

18:13.966 --> 18:16.925
we have acclaimed
author and commentator... 

18:16.926 --> 18:18.845
Dr. Alexandra Kirby.

18:18.846 --> 18:22.094
Author, commentator,
and licensed therapist.

18:22.095 --> 18:25.247
Don't forget those three
little letters, P-h-D.

18:25.542 --> 18:27.601
And I just want to
remind everybody out there

18:27.602 --> 18:30.112
that my new book,
"Moron-proof mothering,"

18:30.113 --> 18:31.426
comes out next week.

18:31.718 --> 18:34.506
And the phone lines
are already lighting up.

18:34.507 --> 18:35.737
You're on the air, caller.

18:35.738 --> 18:37.659
Who would you like to
direct your question to?

18:37.826 --> 18:40.729
Oh, my God! Dr. Alex! I was so excited

18:40.730 --> 18:42.682
when I heard you were
gonna be on the air today.

18:42.878 --> 18:45.169
Well, thank you, darlin'.

18:45.170 --> 18:47.421
When's the next time
you're coming to Pittsburgh?

18:47.422 --> 18:49.652
We waited in line for, like,
three hours to see you last... 

18:49.653 --> 18:54.314
* My love making it just fine, *

19:01.814 --> 19:02.693
Hey, there.

19:02.694 --> 19:04.406
I am in the middle of making you

19:04.407 --> 19:08.518
a very, very special surprise.

19:09.367 --> 19:11.975
Luc, hello? Can you hear me?

19:12.475 --> 19:14.333
Oh, please. You're being ridiculous.

19:14.334 --> 19:16.950
Well, I... I wouldn't say it's ridiculous.

19:16.951 --> 19:19.109
A little old-fashioned maybe, but... 

19:20.165 --> 19:22.710
Luc, darling, you were amazing.

19:22.711 --> 19:25.561
Me? It was all you. I
was just laying there.

19:25.718 --> 19:26.494
Luc?

19:26.495 --> 19:29.199
Hmm. Are you busy later today?

19:29.200 --> 19:31.523
Well, I have this dinner thing, but I... 

19:31.524 --> 19:32.406
"Dinner thing"?

19:32.407 --> 19:34.893
I am making you a strawberry torte, you... 

19:34.894 --> 19:39.673
Fabulous! Then you, me, and
a cabana at the hotel Venegas

19:39.674 --> 19:40.522
have a date.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.119
This afternoon, 3:00 p.m.

19:43.419 --> 19:44.314
Perfect.

19:45.450 --> 19:46.554
Oh, my God.

19:49.404 --> 19:51.788
Scotty, it's me. Listen, we need to talk.

19:52.109 --> 19:54.353
The statistics back me up on this.

19:54.354 --> 19:57.089
Monitor your child's
interactions with their peers.

19:57.090 --> 19:58.625
It'll help you avoid problems,

19:58.626 --> 20:00.962
and they'll thank you for it later.

20:03.782 --> 20:07.876
Uh, well, Dr. Alex, I appreciate
that kind of diligence,

20:07.877 --> 20:09.468
but not every mother has the time.

20:09.469 --> 20:11.805
I mean, there comes a time
when you just have to trust

20:11.806 --> 20:13.030
you've taught your children

20:13.031 --> 20:14.502
the difference between right and wrong

20:14.503 --> 20:16.280
and just let the pieces
fall where they may.

20:16.792 --> 20:19.491
Well, callers, you've heard it here first.

20:19.492 --> 20:21.941
I guess there are some moms
who don't believe their children

20:21.942 --> 20:24.892
are worth making whatever
sacrifices are necessary.

20:25.467 --> 20:28.539
That is what you mean, isn't it, Nora?

20:28.791 --> 20:30.991
I... I don't... I don't think
that's what I... I meant.

20:30.992 --> 20:32.285
N... no.

20:32.394 --> 20:34.232
Uh, let's take another call.

20:34.856 --> 20:38.331
Oh, hi, yeah. Question
for N... Nora Walker.

20:38.681 --> 20:40.144
Sure. Can I get your name, sir?

20:40.506 --> 20:42.593
Well, uh, uh, yeah, it's, uh,

20:42.594 --> 20:44.668
Devon from L.A.

20:47.043 --> 20:48.417
Um, Devon, yes.

20:48.418 --> 20:49.992
Uh, so what's your question?

20:49.993 --> 20:51.854
Uh, well, I was just thinking,
you sound like someone

20:51.855 --> 20:54.569
who knows a lot about
baking, so I was wondering

20:54.570 --> 20:57.920
if you could give me some
hints about baking a cherry pie.

20:59.007 --> 21:02.457
Well, if there's one thing I
know about, it's cherry pies.

21:02.458 --> 21:05.907
This is actually a 2-part answer, Devon,

21:06.120 --> 21:07.657
because you've got your crust,

21:07.658 --> 21:09.306
and you've got your filling.

21:09.481 --> 21:10.356
Now if you... 

21:10.357 --> 21:13.644
If I could just jump in here
before we get to the recipe,

21:13.657 --> 21:16.269
Devon, who are you making this pie for?

21:17.832 --> 21:19.014
Uh, it's... 

21:19.015 --> 21:19.899
for my husband.

21:19.900 --> 21:22.974
Oh, I see. And what kind of pie is this?

21:22.975 --> 21:24.499
Uh, what do you mean?

21:24.500 --> 21:28.306
I mean, is this a birthday
pie, or a thank-you pie?

21:28.307 --> 21:31.005
It's not an apology pie, is it?

21:32.793 --> 21:34.269
Yeah, actually, it is.

21:34.270 --> 21:36.733
What are you apologizing for, sweetheart?

21:37.333 --> 21:39.532
I... I... I've... I've been distant,

21:39.533 --> 21:42.039
- um, lately.
- Are you depressed?

21:42.040 --> 21:44.770
No. G... no. I just
think I'm disappointed.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.719
Um, it was a very hard year for us.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.431
We were trying for a
baby. That didn't work out.

21:49.432 --> 21:53.593
It's just been a lot of things.
I... that's not why I'm calling.

21:53.594 --> 21:55.163
Why don't we get back to the pie?

21:55.164 --> 21:57.971
I take it by distant that
you're referring to the bedroom.

21:57.972 --> 21:59.720
Do you know what's been holding you back?

21:59.721 --> 22:01.807
Are you still attracted to him?

22:01.808 --> 22:04.359
No, of course. It's just, I don't know.

22:04.360 --> 22:07.696
Somehow lately, it's all
been feeling a little... 

22:07.697 --> 22:09.789
Futile, maybe, because
you and your partner

22:09.790 --> 22:12.021
aren't able to have children biologically?

22:13.507 --> 22:15.045
Yeah, maybe.

22:15.532 --> 22:18.494
I've given it a name... wombenvy.

22:19.757 --> 22:20.919
Does that sound right?

22:21.795 --> 22:23.188
Wow. Actually, it does.

22:23.189 --> 22:26.357
Well, Devon, believe it or not,
I have a chapter in my new book

22:26.358 --> 22:27.840
on this very thing.

22:27.913 --> 22:31.106
All the answers are in
my book, available online.

22:31.107 --> 22:34.420
Oh. Oh! Sorry. Sorry.

22:34.945 --> 22:36.467
Okay, thank you, Devon.

22:49.572 --> 22:50.669
Oh, wait, wait, wait. W... 

22:50.670 --> 22:51.944
- wait. No, stop.
- What's wrong?

22:51.945 --> 22:53.146
Stop. No, I can't.

22:56.346 --> 22:57.132
I'm really sorry,

22:57.133 --> 22:59.395
but I... I just... I...
I'm not ready. I'm sorry.

22:59.396 --> 23:02.183
I thought you... I thought
we were on the same page here.

23:02.184 --> 23:04.095
No, I know. I know. But
I just... I can't do this.

23:04.096 --> 23:07.243
I... I thought that I
could, but... I can't.

23:07.244 --> 23:09.895
- Kitty, I... I didn't mean to push you.
- I ca... I can't do this.

23:18.640 --> 23:20.390
Kitty, wait. Stop. What are you doing?

23:20.752 --> 23:23.051
- I never should've come up here.
- Well, where are you gonna go?

23:23.052 --> 23:24.439
I don't know. Maybe I'll go to my mom's.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.856
I mean, this... this was
such a colossal mistake.

23:26.857 --> 23:27.851
Can I beg to differ? Because I... 

23:27.852 --> 23:30.846
- No! No, Jack, you can't.
- Look, was it something Justin said?

23:30.847 --> 23:32.786
No, Jack. Jack, you don't understand.

23:32.787 --> 23:36.614
A... a month ago, I was married.
Okay? Now I may be kissing you,

23:36.615 --> 23:38.136
but I'm still thinking about Robert.

23:38.137 --> 23:39.821
Look, we don't have to
move this fast, Kitty.

23:39.822 --> 23:42.187
- We can slow things down.
- You know what? That's very sweet of you,

23:42.188 --> 23:43.625
but it's not gonna make any difference.

23:43.626 --> 23:48.227
This is never gonna work. We
live completely different lives.

23:48.228 --> 23:50.640
You live up here, and you... and you hike,

23:50.641 --> 23:52.395
- and you take very long
walks in the woods...
- Okay,

23:52.396 --> 23:53.891
there is more to me than that, Kitty.

23:53.892 --> 23:56.801
Well, you know what? There's
a lot more to me than this.

23:57.049 --> 23:57.986
I'm... I'm... 

23:59.086 --> 24:01.523
I'm sorry, but I really
do need to go home.

24:03.498 --> 24:05.322
Okay, we're gonna break for the news

24:05.323 --> 24:07.707
and be back with more "Dear mom"

24:07.708 --> 24:09.185
in just a few minutes.

24:11.598 --> 24:15.010
Oh! All this talking
can make a girl thirsty.

24:15.561 --> 24:17.202
Nora, can I get you something to drink?

24:17.203 --> 24:20.746
No, no, not unless you've got a
shot of Tequila in there, doctor.

24:20.747 --> 24:23.742
Oh, Nora, please. Call me Alexandra.

24:23.743 --> 24:27.072
Yes, Alexandra. Yes, fine.

24:30.294 --> 24:30.894
Okay.

24:31.244 --> 24:32.843
Tough first couple of rounds, I admit it.

24:32.844 --> 24:36.261
Well, thank you so much.
A lot of help you were.

24:36.262 --> 24:38.442
"Womb envy"? What were you thinking?

24:38.443 --> 24:42.439
I... she's a siren. She seduced
me with her birdlike voice.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.316
Look, I can't do this. I can't do this.

24:44.317 --> 24:47.039
I can't go up against her.
I'm gonna tell Frank I'm sick,

24:47.040 --> 24:48.377
and let's just get out of here. Mom,

24:48.378 --> 24:50.183
mom, come on. You can't
just walk out of here.

24:50.184 --> 24:51.528
No one wants to listen to you

24:51.529 --> 24:53.539
if you aren't famous,
and have a fancy title,

24:53.540 --> 24:55.614
and a string of letters behind your name.

24:55.615 --> 24:57.863
Nora Walker, snap out of it

24:57.864 --> 24:58.716
right now.

24:58.891 --> 25:01.741
You're gonna let her hoity-toity
education intimidate you?

25:02.179 --> 25:05.441
Yes. Yes, it's... it's
a show of accomplishment.

25:05.442 --> 25:07.241
What the hell have I ever accomplished?

25:07.387 --> 25:09.811
Me! That's what you've accomplished... 

25:09.812 --> 25:12.535
me and Kitty and Sarah
and Justin and Tommy.

25:12.536 --> 25:14.909
You raised a family,
and you held it together

25:14.910 --> 25:17.311
in the face of remarkable odds,

25:17.354 --> 25:19.520
things that would've made
an average mother crumble.

25:19.521 --> 25:21.058
And you did that without an entourage,

25:21.059 --> 25:23.314
or fancy statistics, or theories.

25:23.315 --> 25:25.627
You did that with love,
and with your heart,

25:25.628 --> 25:26.676
and with your instincts.

25:26.677 --> 25:28.552
And if you'd seen what
I have at work recently,

25:28.553 --> 25:30.514
you would know how rare that is.

25:31.852 --> 25:34.663
You have an amazing gift, mom, amazing,

25:34.664 --> 25:36.527
maybe the most precious there is.

25:38.051 --> 25:39.241
You really think that?

25:39.242 --> 25:40.293
No, I know that,

25:40.294 --> 25:42.037
and this is your chance
to share that with people

25:42.038 --> 25:43.351
beyond our family.

25:43.454 --> 25:47.893
- You said you wanted it.
- I do, I do. Oh, I do. I want it so much.

25:47.894 --> 25:50.365
Okay, so prove it, because
the Nora Walker I know

25:50.366 --> 25:52.276
- would pulverize that big-haired windbag.
- Right, right.

25:52.277 --> 25:55.260
Don't let her walk all over you.
This is a fight you could win,

25:55.261 --> 25:57.459
- and I could sure use a win right now.
- I can win this.

25:57.460 --> 25:59.096
- What do you say, mom?
- I can win this.

25:59.097 --> 26:01.406
- Yes, you can.
- I can't let this big windbag beat me.

26:01.407 --> 26:03.655
No. Whoa. Easy. 

26:03.656 --> 26:05.642
You're not gonna get another
bathroom break for two hours.

26:05.643 --> 26:07.780
Spit. Good.

26:07.797 --> 26:09.954
- Now go get 'em, slugger.
- Okay.

26:09.983 --> 26:13.008
- Just relax.
- I can do it. I'm relaxed.

26:13.979 --> 26:15.555
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:16.479 --> 26:19.290
Nora, you just need to make sure

26:19.291 --> 26:23.394
that this mic is muted
when we're not on the air,

26:23.395 --> 26:25.827
otherwise, the whole
building can hear you.

26:28.140 --> 26:29.553
Go get 'em, slugger.

26:45.398 --> 26:46.573
Oh, boy.

26:46.649 --> 26:48.297
It's Wednesday afternoon.

26:48.298 --> 26:50.165
Don't these people have jobs?

26:50.166 --> 26:52.177
These people are too beautiful for work.

26:54.327 --> 26:56.702
Okay, now I'm officially scarred.

26:57.712 --> 26:58.315
You know, Sarah,

26:58.316 --> 27:00.011
- it's not too late to bail
on this whole thing.
- No, listen,

27:00.012 --> 27:03.137
I want to find out if what I
heard is what I think I heard.

27:03.687 --> 27:06.901
Where is that French man-slut?

27:11.463 --> 27:12.186
Bingo.

27:13.311 --> 27:14.277
Come on, Scotty.

27:14.278 --> 27:17.003
We could be at home making a
heart-shaped torte, you know?

27:17.672 --> 27:20.722
- Why, thank you.
- Luc.

27:21.516 --> 27:22.513
Hey. What are you doing here?

27:22.514 --> 27:24.977
Oh, I thought I'd come down
and drink a glass of cristal

27:24.978 --> 27:27.395
and screw a teenager. How could you?

27:27.396 --> 27:28.842
This is not what you think it is.

27:28.843 --> 27:30.381
Don't tell me that you're
working on your tan,

27:30.382 --> 27:32.616
- because we all know it's fake.
- Hey...

27:34.152 --> 27:35.290
She's a waitress.

27:38.089 --> 27:41.123
- What?
- Ah, come on, Sarah. Let's
do this somewhere else.

27:42.058 --> 27:44.793
- Who are you exactly?
- I'm Luciana.

27:44.794 --> 27:47.981
I took some pictures of your
Luc for our new swim-wear line.

27:48.768 --> 27:49.639
I'm such an idiot.

27:49.640 --> 27:51.718
- Um, I'm... I'm...
- It's just... just a meeting.

27:51.719 --> 27:55.142
I've made a horrible mistake.
I do apologize. Um, for the... 

27:55.143 --> 27:57.684
oh, of course. I understand.
I have a husband, too.

27:59.811 --> 28:00.708
I'm so sorry.

28:01.808 --> 28:03.096
Hey, Sarah, wait, wait, wait.

28:03.097 --> 28:05.611
- No, no, no, just...
- Luc... I messed up.

28:05.612 --> 28:06.734
I'm really sorry.

28:11.922 --> 28:12.597
So... 

28:13.462 --> 28:15.030
I should... I should get her.

28:15.668 --> 28:16.555
Excuse me.

28:41.453 --> 28:42.103
You're home.

28:42.754 --> 28:44.328
Yes, I am home.

28:46.628 --> 28:48.062
Oh... 

28:48.063 --> 28:49.175
Ooh, may I?

28:49.525 --> 28:50.088
Sure.

28:51.888 --> 28:53.931
So I got your message.

28:53.932 --> 28:55.133
What's the good news?

28:55.520 --> 28:56.570
Do you remember my friend,

28:56.571 --> 28:58.308
the photographer who took pictures of me?

28:58.632 --> 29:00.078
Mm. Sure.

29:00.079 --> 29:02.078
Okay, well, he called me today,

29:02.079 --> 29:04.116
and an agent saw the pictures,

29:04.117 --> 29:06.890
and you're never gonna believe
it, but I got a meeting.

29:07.652 --> 29:08.315
Modeling?

29:10.077 --> 29:12.224
I know. I know, I know. It's
for an underwear campaign.

29:12.225 --> 29:13.477
- You're kidding me.
- No.

29:13.478 --> 29:15.614
- That's hilarious.
- Yeah, ridiculous.

29:17.102 --> 29:18.289
It's really well-paid.

29:20.551 --> 29:21.559
How well-paid?

29:21.560 --> 29:22.584
Really well-paid.

29:22.585 --> 29:25.073
Like, one shoot, and
I can paint for a year.

29:27.135 --> 29:28.415
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

29:28.416 --> 29:31.279
That money, Sarah, gives us freedom.

29:35.895 --> 29:36.533
Oh.

29:38.270 --> 29:39.708
Wait till you see this painting.

29:40.236 --> 29:41.130
This is the one.

29:42.102 --> 29:44.489
I will be finished with this any day now.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.741
I'm sorry to say this, darling,
but it sounds like your friend

29:54.742 --> 29:56.623
is two sandwiches short of a picnic.

29:56.624 --> 29:58.199
You know, that's what my husband said.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.523
- I knew you'd see my side of things.
- Hey, Kit.

30:00.524 --> 30:03.223
Hi, Kev. Where is mom?
She... she's not at home.

30:03.224 --> 30:04.536
She's not answering her cell,

30:04.537 --> 30:06.061
and I really need to talk to her.

30:06.374 --> 30:08.772
And if that doesn't help you, sugar,

30:08.773 --> 30:10.833
all the answers are in my book.

30:10.834 --> 30:15.222
Okay, next up is Catherine,
calling from Pasadena.

30:15.609 --> 30:19.108
Uh, hi. Yes, this one's for Nora Walker.

30:19.787 --> 30:22.061
I recently lost my husband.

30:22.386 --> 30:25.187
Well, Catherine, that... that sounds like

30:25.188 --> 30:26.899
a very hard situation.

30:27.048 --> 30:27.460
Yes,

30:27.461 --> 30:30.995
- but I met another man.
- You did?

30:30.996 --> 30:34.516
- Well, that's wonderful.
- Yeah, but when things got too close...

30:34.517 --> 30:35.629
You know what I mean?

30:36.278 --> 30:39.039
I couldn't do it. I mean,
I literally could not do it.

30:39.040 --> 30:42.240
And I... I panicked... and I ran away.

30:42.803 --> 30:43.441
Oh... 

30:44.628 --> 30:45.828
what are you feeling now?

30:46.290 --> 30:48.202
Well, I feel sad, I feel guilty,

30:48.203 --> 30:51.090
and... I'm afraid.

30:51.091 --> 30:54.363
I'm afraid that I'm never gonna
get out of this fog that I'm in,

30:54.364 --> 30:55.905
and I'm afraid that
I'm never gonna be able

30:55.906 --> 30:58.006
- to be with another man.
- Oh, honey...

30:58.007 --> 31:00.677
- uh, Catherine, dear... 
- You know, Catherine,

31:01.139 --> 31:04.920
most people consider a year to
be the minimum waiting period.

31:04.921 --> 31:06.432
- Statistics show...
- Well,

31:06.433 --> 31:09.580
that's all Jim dandy,
peachy keen, Dr. Alex,

31:09.581 --> 31:11.751
but statistics can't
hold your hand at night

31:11.752 --> 31:13.966
or... or share a cup of
coffee with you in the morning.

31:13.967 --> 31:17.452
- Do you have any idea how
hard it is to lose a husband?
- I...

31:17.453 --> 31:20.098
Well, I do, and so I know.

31:20.120 --> 31:22.514
Listen, Catherine, you're grieving,

31:22.515 --> 31:25.929
not only for the husband you lost,

31:26.229 --> 31:28.754
but for the life you had envisioned.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.190
You're grieving for the future

31:31.191 --> 31:34.341
and all the plans and
dreams you had in your head.

31:34.866 --> 31:36.928
And now that's all... gone.

31:39.042 --> 31:40.103
There's a wonderful saying... 

31:40.104 --> 31:42.529
you have to give up the
life you've planned... 

31:42.530 --> 31:44.830
to find the life that's waiting for you.

31:47.510 --> 31:48.084
Hey, Kev.

31:48.085 --> 31:50.597
Talk fast. I'm meeting this
girl, in, uh, in five minutes.

31:50.598 --> 31:52.583
Are you listening to
this? Listening to what?

31:52.584 --> 31:55.108
Mom's on the radio. 730 am.

31:55.421 --> 31:56.334
Mom's on the radio?

31:57.767 --> 31:59.623
All... all our lives, we... we grow

31:59.624 --> 32:01.866
by giving up things... 

32:01.867 --> 32:03.906
- by loss and... and moving on...
- Okay, bye.

32:03.907 --> 32:05.430
Big things, little ones.

32:05.431 --> 32:09.366
How we handle those losses
really defines who are.

32:10.768 --> 32:12.565
Where are you now, Kitty... Catherine?

32:12.566 --> 32:14.316
I'm at my mom's house.

32:14.317 --> 32:18.354
Great. Great. Good idea.
That's a really good idea.

32:18.704 --> 32:22.417
But listen, you don't really
need her to tell you what to do.

32:22.418 --> 32:25.901
All you need from her is
just to listen, that's all,

32:25.902 --> 32:27.602
a place where you can talk out loud

32:27.603 --> 32:29.589
so you can hear what you really think,

32:29.590 --> 32:33.389
what you think, not... her.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.053
You'll know what to do and what not to do,

32:36.054 --> 32:37.479
'cause that's all right, too.

32:37.804 --> 32:39.841
And you'll know when it's time to move on.

32:43.224 --> 32:46.610
And to the gentleman who called in earlier

32:46.611 --> 32:49.049
with the womb envy... Devon... 

32:49.561 --> 32:51.300
what the hell is that anyway?

32:51.698 --> 32:54.398
You don't want a womb. You want a child.

32:54.699 --> 32:57.035
You tried, and it didn't work out,

32:57.036 --> 32:59.122
and that loss, or disappointment,

32:59.123 --> 33:00.723
as you put it,

33:01.598 --> 33:03.586
is just as real as Catherine's.

33:03.923 --> 33:06.323
So is the grief and sadness,

33:06.685 --> 33:08.659
and if you don't acknowledge it

33:08.660 --> 33:10.835
and feel it, it will
never get out of your way.

33:10.836 --> 33:12.443
Unacknowledged feelings

33:12.444 --> 33:15.122
are like a drunken cousin
at a family reunion.

33:15.123 --> 33:17.543
They never shut up so
you can hear anyone else.

33:17.544 --> 33:20.641
And you have to be able to
hear what's next in your life,

33:20.642 --> 33:23.229
what path you might want to travel down,

33:23.230 --> 33:25.018
with or without children.

33:25.293 --> 33:27.185
You have to be able to
see what's right there... 

33:27.186 --> 33:29.321
right there, right in front of your eyes.

33:29.322 --> 33:31.754
- Did you hear that, Catherine?
- Uh...

33:31.804 --> 33:32.366
Catherine?

33:32.367 --> 33:33.793
I have to go, mom.

33:46.404 --> 33:47.665
What are you doing here, Jack?

33:47.666 --> 33:49.079
You don't know my whole story.

33:50.265 --> 33:52.940
I guess I never told you where I was from,

33:53.340 --> 33:54.978
before I moved to Ojai.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.122
I used to have a place up on Mulholland,

33:58.922 --> 33:59.772
worked downtown.

34:00.584 --> 34:01.671
Really? Seriously?

34:02.046 --> 34:03.984
Yeah. Classic story, I guess.

34:04.014 --> 34:07.629
Successful investment
banker becomes disillusioned,

34:07.630 --> 34:08.876
sells everything,

34:08.877 --> 34:11.938
and escapes to Ojai to become a carpenter.

34:12.789 --> 34:15.063
Look, I'm not trying to replace him.

34:15.112 --> 34:16.976
What I'm trying to say is that... 

34:17.869 --> 34:20.693
maybe we're not as different
as you think we are.

34:46.962 --> 34:47.706
Oh, there you are.

34:50.257 --> 34:51.393
I'm so sorry.

34:52.010 --> 34:53.643
- You don't have to apologize.
- No, I do.

34:53.643 --> 34:55.746
Storming in on you like that, it was... 

34:56.572 --> 34:58.387
just, when I heard that phone call,

34:58.388 --> 34:59.685
my imagination... 

35:01.384 --> 35:03.771
went to the worst possible version of you.

35:08.379 --> 35:09.803
Okay, apology's accepted.

35:12.452 --> 35:13.091
What's all this?

35:13.353 --> 35:14.877
Oh, a picnic.

35:15.839 --> 35:19.226
I was trying to recreate our first date.

35:19.888 --> 35:20.576
That's nice.

35:28.092 --> 35:31.617
Luc, I really... don't
think I'm up for all of this.

35:32.480 --> 35:33.242
What do you mean?

35:33.780 --> 35:36.329
If this is what you
want your life to be now,

35:37.466 --> 35:40.795
sitting by the swimming pool
and hanging out with models,

35:40.796 --> 35:44.441
schmoozing all night at
Hollywood nightclubs, I... 

35:44.542 --> 35:45.503
Qhat are you saying?

35:45.866 --> 35:49.545
One day, one of those
"cocktail waitresses"

35:49.546 --> 35:51.460
is gonna offer you more than a drink.

35:51.461 --> 35:53.395
Oh, come on, Sarah. You
know I'm not like that.

35:53.396 --> 35:54.596
I would never do that to you.

35:54.642 --> 35:57.479
I'm the man you met at that
picnic, and I always will be.

36:01.479 --> 36:03.830
When was the last time you
picked up a paint brush?

36:03.831 --> 36:05.130
Uh, I don't know.

36:05.947 --> 36:07.222
Look at this painting.

36:08.409 --> 36:10.273
You have not touched that

36:10.274 --> 36:13.035
since the day you got
your first modeling job.

36:14.546 --> 36:16.111
I'm sorry. I guess I've
gotten a little lost.

36:16.112 --> 36:19.125
You said modeling was a way
for you to support your passion.

36:19.550 --> 36:20.342
When I look around,

36:20.343 --> 36:22.815
it feels like you've
given that passion up.

36:25.979 --> 36:28.458
You know what I did the
day I got that first check?

36:40.172 --> 36:41.931
I... I... I got this.

36:43.594 --> 36:44.793
Oh, my God. Luc.

36:48.723 --> 36:50.006
I just didn't give it to you yet

36:50.007 --> 36:51.880
because I knew the man I was becoming

36:51.881 --> 36:53.874
wasn't really the man you
were supposed to marry.

36:53.875 --> 36:56.766
- Luc, that's crazy. I'd n...
- You're right.

36:56.767 --> 36:58.917
I stopped following my
dream because I was scared.

37:00.879 --> 37:03.679
And there's only two things
I care about in this world.

37:04.404 --> 37:05.366
It's my painting... 

37:06.779 --> 37:07.559
and it's you, my love.

37:10.015 --> 37:10.944
So I'm done.

37:12.133 --> 37:13.252
I'm done being scared.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.598
If I can be that man again,

37:17.609 --> 37:18.897
the man you met at the picnic... 

37:20.360 --> 37:21.149
the painter... 

37:23.321 --> 37:24.509
if I can be that man again,

37:24.742 --> 37:27.417
could you possibly consider
being that man's wife?

37:30.382 --> 37:31.603
Could I consider it?

37:35.991 --> 37:38.803
Oh, yes. Yes.

37:38.882 --> 37:39.388
I love you.

37:59.998 --> 38:02.158
Nora. I'm glad I caught you.

38:02.536 --> 38:04.085
Oh, thank you for everything, Frank.

38:04.086 --> 38:08.371
- I... I... I know it's not up to you...
- Guess what. You got the job.

38:08.721 --> 38:12.207
- Oh, my God!
- They said they loved your honesty,

38:12.208 --> 38:12.984
they loved the way

38:12.985 --> 38:15.439
you talked to the callers as
if they were your own children,

38:15.440 --> 38:17.056
uh, but I gotta tell you, bottom line,

38:17.057 --> 38:21.805
- you were a lot cheaper than Dr. Alex.
- Yes, I... I imagine so.

38:21.806 --> 38:23.830
I got the job! I got the job!

38:23.831 --> 38:25.332
Nora Walker... 

38:25.768 --> 38:26.592
I gotta go.

38:26.593 --> 38:29.705
You cagey little Pasadena homemaker, you.

38:30.694 --> 38:32.881
I guess congratulations are in order,

38:32.882 --> 38:34.495
which is so totally fine with me.

38:34.496 --> 38:36.173
I don't know what I was
thinking. I don't have the time

38:36.174 --> 38:38.224
to put this little a.m.
radio thing in my life.

38:38.225 --> 38:40.707
It could never be worth my
while, so it's all yours.

38:41.044 --> 38:42.895
And let me tell you something, darlin',

38:44.081 --> 38:46.657
you're not gonna be able
to keep that up, you know.

38:47.245 --> 38:47.618
What?

38:47.619 --> 38:49.481
Devon, Catherine?

38:49.944 --> 38:52.386
Oh, Nora, naughty, naughty.

38:52.387 --> 38:55.068
They're your own children, are they not?

38:55.418 --> 38:57.393
Not all of them. I have more.

38:57.568 --> 38:59.092
Nora, let me give you a piece of advice

38:59.093 --> 39:01.227
as you start on this sweet
little career of yours.

39:01.228 --> 39:03.887
Don't lie to your audience.
You didn't hear my children

39:03.888 --> 39:05.185
calling in trying to save their mother

39:05.186 --> 39:08.848
- from embarrassing herself, did you?
- No, I... I didn't.

39:09.173 --> 39:11.336
But that's kind of what my family does.

39:11.337 --> 39:12.623
We try to help each other.

39:12.898 --> 39:15.373
I'm sure your children
would want to help you

39:15.374 --> 39:16.674
if they thought they could.

39:17.036 --> 39:18.935
My children have very busy lives.

39:18.936 --> 39:19.947
They have better things to do

39:19.948 --> 39:22.225
than to sit around listening
to the radio all day.

39:22.262 --> 39:23.140
Well, I'm sure they've

39:23.141 --> 39:25.624
- called in at one time or another.
- No, never.

39:25.625 --> 39:27.873
- But they've read your books.
- I'm sure not.

39:27.874 --> 39:30.043
- Well, how do you know?
Have you asked 'em?
- No, I have not.

39:30.044 --> 39:32.361
Well, why don't you ask 'em?
Because I don't talk to them.

39:32.362 --> 39:34.473
You don't talk to your kids?

39:35.923 --> 39:37.560
They won't call me back.

39:39.794 --> 39:40.818
Well, th... 

39:41.880 --> 39:42.518
then... 

39:44.417 --> 39:45.955
you go over to their house,

39:46.392 --> 39:47.905
and you ring the doorbell,

39:48.317 --> 39:50.956
and ring it and ring it and
ring it until they answer.

39:50.957 --> 39:53.598
And when they do, you look 'em
straight in the face and say,

39:53.599 --> 39:56.743
"ignore me if you want,
but I'm your mother,

39:56.744 --> 39:58.429
and I'm never gonna leave your life,

39:58.839 --> 40:00.976
so we might as well
get to know each other."

40:02.064 --> 40:02.621
You think?

40:02.622 --> 40:04.081
Yes, I think.

40:13.821 --> 40:15.709
I thought you were gonna try
to get to bed early tonight.

40:16.647 --> 40:19.496
Yeah. Uh, we need to talk.

40:20.534 --> 40:22.224
Okay. What's... what's going on?

40:22.225 --> 40:26.722
I've been afraid for,
uh, the last few months,

40:26.723 --> 40:28.512
and because I've been afraid, I've... 

40:29.509 --> 40:32.159
been trying to do everything
to avoid the future.

40:33.135 --> 40:34.815
Okay, now you're freaking me out.

40:34.816 --> 40:36.808
Should I be afraid?

40:37.309 --> 40:37.921
No.

40:38.384 --> 40:39.674
Uh, no, you shouldn't.

40:39.675 --> 40:40.408
Um... 

40:42.444 --> 40:45.170
neither of us should
be, because we are happy,

40:45.171 --> 40:46.368
and we're in love,

40:46.369 --> 40:47.095
and... 

40:48.919 --> 40:51.357
Did you hear mom on the radio today?

40:51.396 --> 40:53.283
Oh, uh, yeah, I... I... 

40:53.284 --> 40:55.258
She was amazing, and it hit me... 

40:55.896 --> 40:56.970
being a good parent,

40:56.971 --> 41:00.496
it's the greatest gift anyone can give.

41:01.845 --> 41:04.681
And we are gonna be great parents, Scotty.

41:06.599 --> 41:07.998
O... oh, Kevin... 

41:07.999 --> 41:10.186
I think we should foster.

41:10.985 --> 41:12.621
I think we should adopt a child,

41:12.622 --> 41:15.134
because I read these files every day,

41:15.135 --> 41:17.697
and there are so many kids
out there who need help.

41:18.247 --> 41:21.760
I just think now is the right time.

41:24.172 --> 41:25.085
What do you think?

41:27.473 --> 41:28.634
God, Kevin, I... I... I...

41:31.009 --> 41:33.532
I... I guess I... I'm
not, um, ready for this.

41:33.533 --> 41:35.485
But we are ready. I know we are.

41:35.486 --> 41:38.194
No, it's not that. I think it's a... 

41:39.394 --> 41:41.444
I think it's a great idea. I just... 

41:46.593 --> 41:47.756
That's not the problem, Kevin.

41:47.757 --> 41:51.089
Okay. Just tell me what the
problem is so we can fix it.

41:51.090 --> 41:53.289
We... can't.

41:54.674 --> 41:55.661
What are you talking about?

42:01.873 --> 42:02.935
I did something, Kevin.

42:07.247 --> 42:08.347
There was someone else.

42:11.097 --> 42:11.726
What do you mean?

42:11.727 --> 42:14.919
It was one time. It was months ago.

42:16.331 --> 42:17.894
I didn't want to hurt
you, so I didn't tell you.

42:17.895 --> 42:20.704
I would do anything in
the world to take it back.

42:20.705 --> 42:21.793
I'm so sorry.

42:25.816 --> 42:26.954
Kevin, say something.

42:26.955 --> 42:35.636
