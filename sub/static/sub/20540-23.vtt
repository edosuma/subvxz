00:33.467 --> 00:34.600
WELCOME, WELCOME

00:34.600 --> 00:36.166
TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:36.166 --> 00:36.800
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:36.800 --> 00:37.200
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:37.200 --> 00:39.767
FOR JOINING US.

00:39.767 --> 00:40.500
LOOK, AS WE SPEAK,

00:40.500 --> 00:41.500
HURRICANE IRMA IS BATTERING

00:41.500 --> 00:42.600
FLORIDA, AND FOR COVERAGE OF

00:42.600 --> 00:43.633
THAT, I CANNOT RECOMMEND

00:43.633 --> 00:44.734
STRONGLY ENOUGH THAT YOU WATCH

00:44.734 --> 00:46.767
SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT NOW.

00:46.767 --> 00:48.433
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT

00:48.433 --> 00:49.667
TO CATCH UP ON.

00:49.667 --> 00:50.767
WE'VE BEEN OFF FOR THE LAST

00:50.767 --> 00:55.600
COUPLE OF WEEKS AND HAVE MISSED

00:55.600 --> 00:56.667
A GREAT DEAL OF STORIES

00:56.667 --> 00:57.266
FROM CONTINUING TENSIONS WITH

00:57.266 --> 00:57.767
NORTH KOREA TO EQUIFAX'S

00:57.767 --> 00:58.367
MASSIVE DATA BREACH

00:59.066 --> 01:00.800
THE TAYLOR SWIFT TRAIN.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.400
LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO,

01:02.400 --> 01:04.767
TAYLOR.

01:04.767 --> 01:05.700
BUT WE HAVE TO BEGIN TONIGHT

01:05.700 --> 01:07.433
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

01:07.433 --> 01:10.200
THE ERIC TRUMP OF OLD PEOPLE.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.734
THE PRESIDENT HAD AN ERRATIC

01:11.734 --> 01:12.800
WEEK, EVEN BY HIS STANDARDS,

01:12.800 --> 01:13.500
BEST CHARACTERIZED BY TWO

01:13.500 --> 01:15.033
BIG DECISIONS.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.367
ON WEDNESDAY, HE MET WITH

01:16.367 --> 01:17.100
CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS TO HAMMER

01:17.100 --> 01:18.934
OUT A DEAL TO RAISE THE DEBT

01:18.934 --> 01:21.000
CEILING AND FUND THE GOVERNMENT.

01:21.000 --> 01:21.567
DEMOCRATS WANTED JUST

01:21.567 --> 01:22.934
A THREE-MONTH EXTENSION

01:22.934 --> 01:24.734
TO GIVE THEM STRATEGIC LEVERAGE,

01:24.734 --> 01:25.567
WHILE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP

01:25.567 --> 01:26.633
WAS UNDERSTANDABLY FIERCELY

01:26.633 --> 01:28.333
AGAINST THAT.

01:28.333 --> 01:29.166
>> REPUBLICANS WANTED

01:29.166 --> 01:30.567
A LONG-TERM SOLUTION TO AVOID

01:30.567 --> 01:31.567
ANOTHER BRUISING FIGHT

01:31.567 --> 01:33.900
IN DECEMBER.

01:33.900 --> 01:35.200
BUT IN THE OVAL OFFICE, SITTING

01:35.200 --> 01:36.266
DOWN WITH LEADERS OF BOTH

01:36.266 --> 01:37.266
PARTIES, THE PRESIDENT SIDED

01:37.266 --> 01:39.233
WITH THE DEMOCRATS.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.233
THAT STUNNING IMAGE,

01:40.233 --> 01:41.367
THE PRESIDENT CUTTING A DEAL

01:41.367 --> 01:43.400
WITH DEMOCRATS AND BLINDSIDING

01:43.400 --> 01:45.967
HIS OWN PARTY.

01:45.967 --> 01:47.333
>> John: YEAH, THAT IS

01:47.333 --> 01:48.467
A SURPRISING MOVE, AS YOU CAN

01:48.467 --> 01:51.300
SEE FROM SCHUMER'S EXPRESSION.

01:51.300 --> 01:52.867
IT'S AS IF HE'S IN THE MIDST OF

01:52.867 --> 01:53.767
SAYING "YOU...

01:53.767 --> 01:54.567
ARE NOT VERY SMART, ARE YA,

01:54.567 --> 01:56.834
BUDDY?"

01:56.834 --> 01:57.700
AND THE DETAILS OF HOW

01:57.700 --> 01:58.700
THE NEGOTIATION UNFOLDED ARE

01:58.700 --> 02:00.000
REALLY STRIKING, BECAUSE THREE

02:00.000 --> 02:00.867
MONTHS WAS THE DEMOCRATS' FIRST

02:00.867 --> 02:01.934
OFFER.

02:01.934 --> 02:04.000
AND TRUMP JUST TOOK IT.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.467
IT WAS SO SHOCKING, REPUBLICANS

02:05.467 --> 02:08.300
APPARENTLY FROZE IN MID-SMILE.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.600
WHICH MUST'VE BEEN AN UNSETTLING

02:09.600 --> 02:10.467
SIGHT, GIVEN THAT I WILL

02:10.467 --> 02:11.800
REMIND YOU THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS

02:11.800 --> 02:12.500
LIKE WHEN MITCH MCCONNELL

02:12.500 --> 02:15.300
SMILES IN REAL TIME.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.600
IT'S CREEPY WHEN IT MOVES.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.734
IT'S DOWNRIGHT TERRIFYING

02:18.734 --> 02:21.266
WHEN IT FREEZES.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.166
AND BEFORE REPUBLICANS COULD

02:22.166 --> 02:22.734
EVEN TRY AND SALVAGE

02:22.734 --> 02:24.500
THE MEETING, IT WAS COMPLETELY

02:24.500 --> 02:25.734
DERAILED.

02:25.734 --> 02:26.667
>> AT THE HEIGHT OF A TENSE

02:26.667 --> 02:27.633
MEETING, SOURCES SAY,

02:27.633 --> 02:29.000
FIRST DAUGHTER IVANKA TRUMP

02:29.000 --> 02:30.400
ENTERED THE OVAL OFFICE TO

02:30.400 --> 02:32.300
PITCH HER AGENDA ON THE CHILD

02:32.300 --> 02:33.667
TAX CREDIT, THROWING THE MEETING

02:33.667 --> 02:35.567
OFF-TOPIC.

02:35.567 --> 02:36.867
REPUBLICAN LEADERS VISIBLY

02:36.867 --> 02:39.166
ANNOYED BY HER PRESENCE.

02:39.166 --> 02:40.333
>> John: YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE

02:40.333 --> 02:41.133
THAT'S ACTUALLY THE NAME OF

02:41.133 --> 02:43.600
IVANKA'S UPCOMING BIOGRAPHY:

02:43.600 --> 02:44.333
"VISIBLY ANNOYED BY HER

02:44.333 --> 02:45.233
PRESENCE: THE IVANKA TRUMP

02:45.233 --> 02:46.934
STORY."

02:46.934 --> 02:47.934
AND THAT WAS FAR FROM THE MOST

02:47.934 --> 02:48.967
UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENT INVOLVING

02:48.967 --> 02:50.333
IVANKA THIS WEEK, BECAUSE AT

02:50.333 --> 02:51.700
A NORTH DAKOTA EVENT LATER

02:51.700 --> 02:53.333
THAT SAME DAY, HE INTRODUCED HER

02:53.333 --> 02:55.533
LIKE THIS.

02:55.533 --> 02:56.567
>> COME UP, HONEY.

02:56.567 --> 02:57.500
SHOULD I BRING IVANKA UP?

02:57.500 --> 02:59.000
COME ON UP, HONEY.

02:59.000 --> 02:59.934
SHE'S SO GOOD.

02:59.934 --> 03:01.166
SHE WANTED TO MAKE THE TRIP.

03:01.166 --> 03:02.433
SHE SAID, "DAD, CAN I GO?"

03:02.433 --> 03:04.333
SHE ACTUALLY SAID, "DADDY,

03:04.333 --> 03:04.767
CAN I GO WITH YOU?"

03:04.767 --> 03:05.133
I LIKE THAT.

03:05.133 --> 03:05.934
RIGHT?

03:05.934 --> 03:06.834
"DADDY, CAN I GO WITH YOU?"

03:06.834 --> 03:08.600
I SAID, "YES, YOU CAN."

03:08.600 --> 03:10.433
>> John: OH.

03:10.433 --> 03:11.767
HIS 35-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

03:11.767 --> 03:12.367
CLLS HIM "DADDY"

03:12.367 --> 03:14.467
AND HE LIKES IT.

03:14.467 --> 03:15.700
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE FACTS THAT

03:15.700 --> 03:16.700
ON SOME LEVEL, I ALREADY KNEW.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.667
I JUST NEVER WANTED TO HAVE

03:18.667 --> 03:20.467
CONFIRMED LIKE, WHEN SOMEONE

03:20.467 --> 03:21.000
AIRBNB'S YOUR PLACE,

03:21.000 --> 03:22.266
THEY EJACULATE ON LITERALLY

03:22.266 --> 03:24.767
EVERYTHING, OR "IF I WAS THERE

03:24.767 --> 03:25.700
FOR THE MANSON MURDERS,

03:25.700 --> 03:26.467
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE

03:26.467 --> 03:28.100
STABBED SOMEONE."

03:28.100 --> 03:28.600
I AM NOT GOOD

03:28.600 --> 03:29.934
WITH PEER PRESSURE.

03:29.934 --> 03:30.700
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO WEIRD IF I

03:30.700 --> 03:32.533
WAS THE ONLY ONE NOT STABBING.

03:32.533 --> 03:33.533
I'D HAVE PROBABLY

03:33.533 --> 03:35.734
HAD A QUICK STAB.

03:35.734 --> 03:37.700
AND LOOK, IT'S GOOD THAT THE

03:37.700 --> 03:39.934
GOVERNMENT IS GETTING FUNDED.

03:39.934 --> 03:41.567
AND THERE WAS HURRICANE RELIEF

03:41.567 --> 03:42.567
ATTACHED TO THE BILL.

03:42.567 --> 03:43.734
BUT NOBODY SEEMS EXACTLY SURE

03:43.734 --> 03:45.266
WHY TRUMP MADE THIS DECISION.

03:45.266 --> 03:46.066
ONE SENIOR REPUBLICAN AIDE

03:46.066 --> 03:47.367
TOLD POLITICO IT WAS

03:47.367 --> 03:49.633
"MYSTIFYING", ADDING,

03:49.633 --> 03:50.767
"MAYBE IT'S ABOUT THE WALL?

03:50.767 --> 03:51.734
I DON'T KNOW.

03:51.734 --> 03:54.166
NONE OF IT MAKES ANY SENSE."

03:54.166 --> 03:54.767
WHICH REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

03:54.767 --> 03:55.800
THE SLOGAN OF TRUMP'S

03:55.800 --> 03:57.934
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

03:57.934 --> 03:58.934
"MAYBE IT'S ABOUT THE WALL?

03:58.934 --> 04:00.000
I DON'T KNOW.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.166
NONE OF IT MAKES ANY SENSE."

04:04.166 --> 04:05.100
AND THIS WAS NOT THE ONLY BIG

04:05.100 --> 04:06.867
DECISION TRUMP MADE THIS WEEK

04:06.867 --> 04:08.800
FOR LESS-THAN-CLEAR REASONS.

04:08.800 --> 04:09.700
BECAUSE ON TUESDAY, HE TOOK

04:09.700 --> 04:11.533
A FAR MORE CONSEQUENTIAL STEP.

04:11.533 --> 04:12.333
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ENDING

04:12.333 --> 04:13.934
FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S

04:13.934 --> 04:16.500
SIGNATURE IMMIGRATION PROGRAM.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.233
THE DEFERRED ACTION FOR

04:17.233 --> 04:18.700
CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS,

04:18.700 --> 04:20.500
KNOWN AS DACA, PROTECTS ABOUT

04:20.500 --> 04:22.834
800,000 UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS

04:22.834 --> 04:24.400
WHO CAME TO THE U.S. AS KIDS

04:24.400 --> 04:26.700
FROM DEPORTATION.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.066
>> John: YES, DONALD TRUMP ENDED

04:28.066 --> 04:29.333
DACA, WHICH ALLOWED HIM TO BOTH

04:29.333 --> 04:30.834
KILL AN OBAMA-ERA PROGRAM

04:30.834 --> 04:31.967
AND PICK ON HUNDREDS

04:31.967 --> 04:33.400
OF THOUSANDS OF IMMIGRANTS.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.433
WHICH, FOR TRUMP, IS REALLY

04:34.433 --> 04:34.834
KILLING TWO BIRDS

04:34.834 --> 04:36.433
WITH ONE STONE.

04:36.433 --> 04:37.000
INCIDENTALLY, HIS FAVORITE

04:37.000 --> 04:39.800
CHILDHOOD PASTIME.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.100
"MOMMY, I KILLED THE FANCY

04:41.100 --> 04:47.100
PIGEONS AGAIN!

04:47.100 --> 04:49.233
I NEED A NEW BATCH."

04:49.233 --> 04:50.066
NOW, DACA NOT ONLY PROTECTS

04:50.066 --> 04:50.867
ITS RECIPIENTS, OR "DREAMERS,"

04:50.867 --> 04:54.533
FROM DEPORTATION, IT ALLOWS THEM

04:54.533 --> 04:58.033
TO WORK THROUGH

04:58.033 --> 04:59.033
A RENEWABLE TWO-YEAR PERMIT.

04:59.033 --> 04:59.567
IT WAS A TEMPORARY MEASURE

04:59.567 --> 05:00.133
IMPLEMENTED BY

05:00.133 --> 05:00.734
PRESIDENT OBAMA, BECAUSE

05:00.734 --> 05:01.333
CONGRESS HAD FAILED TO PASS

05:01.333 --> 05:01.900
IMMIGRATION REFORM FOR OVER

05:01.900 --> 05:02.166
A DECADE.

05:02.166 --> 05:02.767
AND WHATEVER PEOPLE'S FEELINGS

05:02.767 --> 05:03.400
ON OTHER ASPECTS OF IMMIGRATION,

05:03.400 --> 05:04.066
THEY OVERWHELMINGLY BELIEVE

05:04.066 --> 05:04.667
DREAMERS SHOULD BE ALLOWED

05:04.667 --> 05:06.200
TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.834
THE PROBLEM IS THAT DURING

05:07.834 --> 05:09.400
THE CAMPAIGN, TRUMP PROMISED HIS

05:09.400 --> 05:10.667
BASE NOT ONLY THAT HE WOULD END

05:10.667 --> 05:11.767
DACA BUT THAT HE WOULD DEPORT

05:11.767 --> 05:13.633
ITS RECIPIENTS.

05:13.633 --> 05:17.033
ALTHOUGH BEYOND THAT, HE DIDN'T

05:17.033 --> 05:18.367
REALLY SEEM TO HAVE MUCH IN THE

05:18.367 --> 05:19.200
WAY OF A CONCRETE PLAN.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.066
>> THEY HAVE TO GO.

05:20.066 --> 05:20.667
>> WHAT IF THEY HAVE NO PLACE

05:20.667 --> 05:21.400
TO GO?

05:21.400 --> 05:21.934
>> WE WILL WORK WITH THEM.

05:21.934 --> 05:22.834
THEY HAVE TO GO.

05:22.834 --> 05:24.000
CHUCK -- WE EITHER HAVE

05:24.000 --> 05:25.667
A COUNTRY OR WE DON'T HAVE

05:25.667 --> 05:26.400
A COUNTRY.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.266
WE WILL DO IT AND WE WILL

05:27.266 --> 05:27.900
EXPEDITE IT SO PEOPLE

05:27.900 --> 05:30.667
CAN COME BACK IN.

05:30.667 --> 05:32.500
>> IT'S STILL NOT CLEAR.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.900
>> CHUCK, CHUCK, IT WILL WORK

05:33.900 --> 05:34.767
OUT SO WELL.

05:34.767 --> 05:35.300
YOU'LL BE SO HAPPY.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.333
IN FOUR YEARS, YOU'RE GOING TO

05:36.333 --> 05:37.667
BE INTERVIEWING ME AND SAY,

05:37.667 --> 05:40.500
"WHAT A GREAT JOB YOU'VE DONE,

05:40.500 --> 05:41.400
PRESIDENT TRUMP."

05:41.400 --> 05:43.433
>> John: THAT IS NOT A PLAN.

05:43.433 --> 05:45.000
SAYING "THEY HAVE TO GO," BUT

05:45.000 --> 05:45.834
THEN THEY CAN MAYBE COME BACK

05:45.834 --> 05:47.567
IN AND THEN ENDING SOUNDING LIKE

05:47.567 --> 05:48.767
HE'S TRYING TO HYPNOTIZE

05:48.767 --> 05:49.934
CHUCK TODD.

05:49.934 --> 05:51.667
"IT WILL WORK OUT SO WELL.

05:51.667 --> 05:52.800
YOU'LL BE SO HAPPY.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.166
IN FOUR YEARS, YOU'RE GOING TO

05:54.166 --> 05:55.133
SAY, WHAT A GREAT JOB

05:55.133 --> 05:57.400
YOU'VE DON, PRESIDENT TRUMP.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.033
NOW, WHEN I SNAP MY FINGERS,

05:58.033 --> 06:00.533
YOU'RE GOING TO WAKE UP

06:00.533 --> 06:01.533
AND WET YOUR PANTS."

06:01.533 --> 06:02.767
NOW, YOU WOULD HOPE THAT NOW

06:02.767 --> 06:04.100
HE'S IN OFFICE, TRUMP WOULD'VE

06:04.100 --> 06:05.333
FORMULATED A PLAN OUTLINING

06:05.333 --> 06:06.667
EXACTLY WHAT HE'D LIKE TO SEE

06:06.667 --> 06:08.233
HAPPEN REGARDING THE DREAMERS.

06:08.233 --> 06:09.867
BUT APPARENTLY,

06:09.867 --> 06:10.700
AS LATE AS ONE HOUR BEFORE

06:10.700 --> 06:11.300
THE DECISION WAS TO BE

06:11.300 --> 06:12.567
ANNOUNCED,

06:12.567 --> 06:13.333
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS

06:13.333 --> 06:14.367
PRIVATELY EXPRESSED CONCERN

06:14.367 --> 06:15.266
THAT MR. TRUMP MIGHT NOT FULLY

06:15.266 --> 06:17.433
GRASP THE DETAILS OF THE STEPS

06:17.433 --> 06:19.600
HE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.133
WHICH, AGAIN, IS AWFUL,

06:21.133 --> 06:22.367
BUT SOMETHING WE ALL PROBABLY

06:22.367 --> 06:24.600
PRESUMED ANYWAY.

06:24.600 --> 06:25.600
LIKE THE FACT THAT

06:25.600 --> 06:26.467
TOM HANKS'S CHARACTER IN

06:26.467 --> 06:31.033
"CAST AWAY"

06:31.033 --> 06:34.767
ABSOLUTELY FUCKED WILSON.

06:34.767 --> 06:35.767
NO DOUBT THAT HAPPENED.

06:35.767 --> 06:36.400
AND SURE ENOUGH, THE NEXT DAY,

06:36.400 --> 06:37.100
TRUMP SEEMED TO BE WALKING BACK

06:37.100 --> 06:37.900
HIS DECISION, SAYING,

06:37.900 --> 06:39.367
CONGRESS NOW HAD SIX MONTHS

06:39.367 --> 06:40.500
TO LEGALIZE DACA, AND IF THEY

06:40.500 --> 06:41.266
DIDN'T, HE WOULD

06:41.266 --> 06:43.033
"REVISIT THIS ISSUE."

06:43.033 --> 06:44.433
SO HE'S ALL OVER THE PLACE.

06:44.433 --> 06:45.567
DREAMERS HAVE TO GO.

06:45.567 --> 06:47.033
BUT MAYBE THEY CAN COME BACK IN.

06:47.033 --> 06:47.633
OR MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO

06:47.633 --> 06:48.767
AT ALL.

06:48.767 --> 06:50.166
AND IN THE MEANTIME, 800,000

06:50.166 --> 06:50.633
PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE

06:50.633 --> 06:52.533
IN THE BALANCE.

06:52.533 --> 06:53.433
AND WHEN ASKED ON AIR FORCE ONE

06:53.433 --> 06:54.900
ABOUT THESE MIXED SIGNALS,

06:54.900 --> 06:56.767
HE WAS STILL MADDENINGLY VAGUE

06:56.767 --> 06:57.934
ABOUT ANYTHING RESEMBLING

06:57.934 --> 06:59.500
A PLAN.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.266
>> CHUCK AND NANCY WOULD LIKE

07:01.266 --> 07:02.500
TO SEE SOMETHING HAPPEN,

07:02.500 --> 07:03.900
AND SO DO I.

07:03.900 --> 07:04.834
AND I SAID, IF WE CAN GET

07:04.834 --> 07:05.967
SOMETHING TO HAPPEN, WE'RE GOING

07:05.967 --> 07:07.000
TO SIGN IT, AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE

07:07.000 --> 07:08.667
IT -- WE'RE GONNA MAKE A LOT

07:08.667 --> 07:13.100
OF HAPPY PEOPLE.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.400
>> John: OKAY, LISTEN:

07:14.400 --> 07:15.166
ANYTIME TRUMP

07:15.166 --> 07:16.900
SAYS HE'S GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE

07:16.900 --> 07:17.700
HAPPY OR THAT YOU'RE GOING

07:17.700 --> 07:18.500
TO BE HAPPY IN THE FUTURE,

07:18.500 --> 07:19.734
THAT MEANS HE'S GOT NOTHING,

07:19.734 --> 07:20.166
AND IS TRYING TO END

07:20.166 --> 07:22.133
THE CONVERSATION.

07:22.133 --> 07:23.400
REMEMBER THAT'S HOW HE SHUT DOWN

07:23.400 --> 07:25.033
CHUCK TODD ON THE PLANE.

07:25.033 --> 07:25.633
AND HE DOESN'T JUST DO IT

07:25.633 --> 07:26.500
WITH IMMIGRATION.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.233
HE DOES IT WITH EVERYTHING.

07:28.233 --> 07:28.934
HERE'S HOW HE TALKED TO BUSINESS

07:28.934 --> 07:30.300
LEADERS ABOUT HIS PLANS

07:30.300 --> 07:32.533
TO CHANGE TRADE POLICY.

07:32.533 --> 07:33.700
>> WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE

07:33.700 --> 07:35.834
WHAT'S UP FOR YOU.

07:35.834 --> 07:38.133
YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY.

07:38.133 --> 07:39.400
>> John: THAT IS THE TONE

07:39.400 --> 07:40.834
OF SOMEBODY WHO FORGOT TO BUY AN

07:40.834 --> 07:41.667
ANNIVERSARY GIFT AND IS STALLING

07:41.667 --> 07:43.800
FOR TIME.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.400
"WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE WHAT'S UP

07:45.400 --> 07:46.867
FOR YOU.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.400
I'LL BE BACK IN 45 MINUTES.

07:49.400 --> 07:52.200
YOU'RE GONNA BE SO HAPPY."

07:52.200 --> 07:53.500
HE DOES THIS FOR EVERYTHING.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.467
HERE ARE HIS PROMISES FOR BORDER

07:55.467 --> 07:56.367
SAFETY, THE MIDDLE EAST,

07:56.367 --> 07:57.633
STEEL TARIFFS, REPLACING

07:57.633 --> 07:58.333
OBAMACARE,

07:58.333 --> 07:59.667
AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

07:59.667 --> 08:00.567
>> WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT

08:00.567 --> 08:02.100
SO THAT EVERYBODY IS HAPPY.

08:02.100 --> 08:02.767
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE

08:02.767 --> 08:04.300
VERY HAPPY WITH THE END RESULT.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.066
THE STEEL FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE

08:06.066 --> 08:07.467
VERY HAPPY.

08:07.467 --> 08:08.667
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WILL BE

08:08.667 --> 08:09.700
HAPPY.

08:09.700 --> 08:16.633
RIGHT NOW MILLIONS AND MILLIONS

08:16.633 --> 08:17.400
AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

08:17.400 --> 08:18.333
UNHAPPY.

08:18.333 --> 08:19.233
YOU'RE GONNA BE SO HAPPY

08:19.233 --> 08:19.533
WITH TRUMP.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.100
I THINK YOU ALREADY ARE.

08:20.100 --> 08:20.900
>> John: OKAY, BUT IN EACH

08:20.900 --> 08:21.500
OF THOSE CASES, IT'S THE WAY

08:21.500 --> 08:22.000
YOU GET TO THAT FEELING

08:22.000 --> 08:23.133
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

08:23.133 --> 08:24.166
LAYING OUT A GOVERNMENT POLICY

08:24.166 --> 08:26.333
THAT'S JUST "YOU'LL BE SO HAPPY"

08:26.333 --> 08:27.867
IS LIKE NAMING A RESTAURANT

08:27.867 --> 08:30.333
"YOU'RE GONNA BE SO FULL."

08:30.333 --> 08:33.734
OKAY, THAT'S THE GOAL, BUT HOW?

08:33.734 --> 08:36.567
WHAT AM I FILLING MYSELF WITH?

08:36.567 --> 08:37.567
IS IT ASIAN FUSION

08:37.567 --> 08:43.934
OR WET CEMENT?

08:43.934 --> 08:44.934
I PROMISE THIS HAPPENS ALL THE

08:44.934 --> 08:45.967
TIME.

08:45.967 --> 08:46.734
AND IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING

08:46.734 --> 08:47.367
WHAT HE DOES WHEN PEOPLE AREN'T

08:47.367 --> 08:47.934
HAPPY, DON'T WORRY, HE HAS

08:47.934 --> 08:48.533
A SOLUTION FOR THAT.

08:48.533 --> 08:49.300
BECAUSE REMEMBER THAT DEBT

08:49.300 --> 08:49.934
CEILING MEETING, AND HOW FURIOUS

08:49.934 --> 08:50.533
MITCH MCCONNELL AND PAUL RYAN

08:50.533 --> 08:51.200
WERE?

08:51.200 --> 08:51.967
THIS WAS TRUMP

08:51.967 --> 08:53.734
LATER THAT SAME DAY.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.033
>> AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

08:55.033 --> 08:56.166
WE WALKED OUT OF THERE --

08:56.166 --> 08:58.233
MITCH AND PAUL, AND EVERYBODY,

08:58.233 --> 09:00.266
KEVIN -- AND WE WALKED OUT

09:00.266 --> 09:02.734
AND EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY.

09:02.734 --> 09:04.400
>> John: BUT NO, THEY ABSOLUTELY

09:04.400 --> 09:05.767
WEREN'T!

09:05.767 --> 09:08.133
NOT MITCH, NOT PAUL, NOT KEVIN!

09:08.133 --> 09:09.667
NONE OF THEM!

09:09.667 --> 09:10.700
AND TRUMP MAY BE ABLE TO FOOL

09:10.700 --> 09:11.533
PEOPLE BY SAYING THEY'LL BE

09:11.533 --> 09:13.700
HAPPY IN THE FUTURE, BUT WE

09:13.700 --> 09:14.767
CAN'T LET HIM TRICK PEOPLE INTO

09:14.767 --> 09:15.266
THINKING THEY WERE HAPPY

09:15.266 --> 09:19.800
IN THE PAST.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.533
IN THAT WAY, IT'S ACTUALLY

09:21.533 --> 09:22.633
WEIRDLY IRONIC

09:22.633 --> 09:23.200
THAT HE'S TAKING SUCH A HARD

09:23.200 --> 09:24.000
LINE AGAINST DREAMERS BECAUSE

09:24.000 --> 09:24.500
THIS GUY IS CLEARLY

09:24.500 --> 09:26.000
OUT OF HIS FUCKING MIND.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.100
AND NOW THIS.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.400
>> >> Announcer: A LOOK AT

09:34.400 --> 09:37.734
WHAT THE NFL WILL AND WILL NOT

09:37.734 --> 09:38.000
TOLERATE.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.300
>> COLIN KAEPERNICK IS A

09:39.300 --> 09:39.767
FREE AGENT.

09:39.767 --> 09:41.800
NO TEAM HAS SIGNED HIM.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.200
MANY BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE HE'S

09:43.200 --> 09:44.533
TOO CONTROVERSIAL.

09:44.533 --> 09:47.000
>> THERE'S A LOT OF BAGGAGE THAT

09:47.000 --> 09:48.200
COMES WITH COLIN KAEPERNICK.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.100
>> IF HE IS TOO CONTROVERSIAL.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.633
>> MEANWHILE...

09:52.633 --> 09:55.066
>> SUSPENDED FOR ONE GAME

09:55.066 --> 09:56.066
FOLLOWING AN ARREST IN JANUARY

09:56.066 --> 09:57.700
FOR AN INCIDENT INVOLVING HIM

09:57.700 --> 09:59.734
SPITTING ON A NURSE.

09:59.734 --> 10:01.600
>> VIOLATING THE POLICY ON

10:01.600 --> 10:02.066
PERFORMANCE ENHANCING

10:02.066 --> 10:02.367
SUBSTANCES.

10:02.367 --> 10:02.734
SUBSTANCES.

10:02.734 --> 10:03.834
>> DUI.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.700
>> DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

10:05.700 --> 10:09.667
DECODE DWI.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.700
>> HE VIOLATED A SUBSTANCE ABUSE

10:11.700 --> 10:13.166
POLICY.

10:13.166 --> 10:14.200
BRYANT WAS SUSPENDED FOR THE

10:14.200 --> 10:16.567
FIRST FOUR GAMES LAST SEASON

10:16.567 --> 10:18.333
WHILE HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE

10:18.333 --> 10:21.934
CLEVELAND BROWNS FOR PE V USE.

10:21.934 --> 10:25.133
HE WAS SUSPENDED FOR THREE GAMES

10:25.133 --> 10:26.767
AFTER HE WAS CLAIMED OFF

10:26.767 --> 10:27.133
WAIVERS.

10:27.133 --> 10:30.133
THAT WAS DUE TO AN ARREST IN

10:30.133 --> 10:30.533
2015.

10:30.533 --> 10:33.600
>> THEY WOULD HAVE A TOUGH TIME

10:33.600 --> 10:35.200
SIGNING SOMEBODY WHO PROTESTED

10:35.200 --> 10:36.967
THE AMERICAN FLAG ON THE

10:36.967 --> 10:37.333
NATIONAL ANTHEM.

10:37.333 --> 10:38.266
I WOULDN'T WANT HIM ON MY TEAM.

10:38.266 --> 10:41.967
I WOULDN'T.

10:41.967 --> 10:42.767
>> John: MOVING ON.

10:42.767 --> 10:43.400
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

10:43.400 --> 10:44.333
PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS.

10:44.333 --> 10:45.300
THE ONLY GENUINE

10:45.300 --> 10:47.367
GET-OUT-OF-JAIL FREE CARD.

10:47.367 --> 10:48.934
PARDONS ARE ONE OF THE MOST

10:48.934 --> 10:49.967
POWERFUL TOOLS AVAILABLE

10:49.967 --> 10:50.667
TO A PRESIDENT, AND THEY'VE BEEN

10:50.667 --> 10:51.400
USED CONTROVERSIALLY

10:51.400 --> 10:52.233
IN THE PAST.

10:52.233 --> 10:54.533
BILL CLINTON PARDONED MARC RICH.

10:54.533 --> 10:55.700
GERALD FORD PARDONED

10:55.700 --> 10:56.467
RICHARD NIXON.

10:56.467 --> 10:57.633
AND, AS WE'VE MENTIONED BEFORE,

10:57.633 --> 10:59.033
ABRAHAM LINCOLN ONCE PARDONED

10:59.033 --> 11:02.433
A MAN FOR ATTEMPTED BESTIALITY.

11:02.433 --> 11:04.767
IT'S TRUE!

11:04.767 --> 11:05.567
AND IN FAIRNESS,

11:05.567 --> 11:06.500
THIS WAS THE HORSE!

11:06.500 --> 11:08.834
THAT'S A PRETTY FUCKABLE HORSE.

11:08.834 --> 11:09.433
I'M NOT SAYING YOU SHOULD FUCK

11:09.433 --> 11:10.333
IT.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.567
I'M JUST SAYING I WOULDN'T KICK

11:11.567 --> 11:15.133
IT OUT OF BED FOR EATING APPLES.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.500
THE POINT IS WHILE WE WERE AWAY,

11:16.500 --> 11:17.900
DONALD TRUMP ISSUED HIS VERY

11:17.900 --> 11:18.967
FIRST PARDON, AND IT WAS

11:18.967 --> 11:20.800
A DOOZY.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.233
>> A LEGAL LIGHTNING BOLT FROM

11:22.233 --> 11:24.233
PRESIDENT TRUMP LATE FRIDAY.

11:24.233 --> 11:25.133
A PRESIDENTIAL PARDON

11:25.133 --> 11:27.033
FOR ARIZONA'S CONTROVERSIAL

11:27.033 --> 11:28.834
ANTI-ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

11:28.834 --> 11:32.233
HARD-LINER, SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.233
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT.

11:33.233 --> 11:34.166
DONALD TRUMP PARDONED

11:34.166 --> 11:35.633
JOE ARPAIO, A MAN WHO ANSWERS

11:35.633 --> 11:38.500
THE QUESTION, "WHAT IF A RUSSET

11:38.500 --> 11:45.600
POTATO SOMEHOW HATED MEXICANS?"

11:45.600 --> 11:48.633
LET'S LOOK AT THAT DECISION.

11:48.633 --> 11:49.500
BECAUSE IF THE PRESIDENT OF THE

11:49.500 --> 11:50.100
UNITED STATES IS GOING TO USE

11:50.100 --> 11:50.900
HIS VERY FIRST PARDON ON

11:50.900 --> 11:51.533
SOMEONE, THIS EARLY IN HIS TERM,

11:51.533 --> 11:52.633
IT IS WORTH LOOKING AT

11:52.633 --> 11:53.333
WHO JOE ARPAIO IS, AND WHAT

11:53.333 --> 11:53.867
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS

11:53.867 --> 11:54.867
DECISION MAY BE.

11:54.867 --> 11:56.633
AND YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD

11:56.633 --> 12:00.467
OF JOE ARPAIO BEFORE.

12:00.467 --> 12:01.367
HE HAS CAREFULLY CULTIVATED

12:01.367 --> 12:02.233
AN IMAGE OVER 25 YEARS

12:02.233 --> 12:02.734
AS A HARD-NOSED SHERIFF,

12:02.734 --> 12:04.367
WITH UNCONVENTIONAL METHODS,

12:04.367 --> 12:06.000
THAT THE MEDIA HAS LAPPED UP.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.967
>> SHERIFF ARPAIO, WHO HAS BEEN

12:09.967 --> 12:10.600
DUBBED AMERICA'S TOUGHEST

12:10.600 --> 12:12.900
SHERIFF.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.333
>> AMERICA'S TOUGHEST SHERIFF,

12:14.333 --> 12:15.900
JOE ARPAIO.

12:15.900 --> 12:16.967
>> HE IS KNOWN AS AMERICA'S

12:16.967 --> 12:18.200
TOUGHEST SHERIFF FOR HIS

12:18.200 --> 12:19.400
CRACKDOWNS ON ILLEGAL

12:19.400 --> 12:20.800
IMMIGRATION AND PETTY CRIME.

12:20.800 --> 12:21.867
>> HE BRAGS ABOUT MAKING

12:21.867 --> 12:23.333
PRISONERS EAT BOLOGNA SANDWICHES

12:23.333 --> 12:24.500
SO ROTTEN THE MEAT HAS TURNED

12:24.500 --> 12:25.367
GREEN.

12:25.367 --> 12:25.967
>> HE MAKES HIS INMATES

12:25.967 --> 12:26.967
WEAR PINK.

12:26.967 --> 12:28.166
HE USES CHAIN GANGS.

12:28.166 --> 12:29.166
>> INMATES ARE FORCED TO WEAR

12:29.166 --> 12:30.834
STRIPED PRISON GARB

12:30.834 --> 12:37.700
AND PINK UNDERWEAR.

12:37.700 --> 12:38.467
>> John: WELL, THAT IS JUST

12:38.467 --> 12:39.367
AWFUL.

12:39.367 --> 12:40.200
THE PINK UNDERWEAR IS FINE,

12:40.200 --> 12:41.100
BUT NO ONE SHOULD BE FORCED

12:41.100 --> 12:41.667
TO WEAR HORIZONTAL STRIPES.

12:41.667 --> 12:45.734
THEY WIDEN THE SILHOUETTE!

12:45.734 --> 12:46.834
THAT'S A FASHION FACT.

12:46.834 --> 12:47.333
ARPAIO DID NOT MIND THAT

12:47.333 --> 12:48.033
COVERAGE.

12:48.033 --> 12:48.533
HE ACTUALLY WELCOMED IT.

12:48.533 --> 12:49.567
HE LOVES BEING ON CAMERA

12:49.567 --> 12:51.266
SO MUCH, HE ESSENTIALLY SPENT

12:51.266 --> 12:52.467
YEARS TREATING PRISONERS

12:52.467 --> 12:54.834
AS PROPS FOR A REALITY SHOW,

12:54.834 --> 12:56.066
AND SOMETIMES LITERALLY.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.100
HE ACTUALLY HAD A SHORT-LIVED

12:57.100 --> 12:58.200
SHOW CALLED

12:58.200 --> 12:59.867
"SMILE, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST,"

12:59.867 --> 13:01.200
WHERE PEOPLE WITH OUTSTANDING

13:01.200 --> 13:02.233
WARRANTS WOULD BE TRICKED INTO

13:02.233 --> 13:03.734
APPEARING ON A SET ONLY TO BE

13:03.734 --> 13:04.867
PRANKED IN THE WORST WAY

13:04.867 --> 13:06.667
POSSIBLE.

13:06.667 --> 13:07.533
>> HEY, YO, YO, YO,

13:07.533 --> 13:14.533
I GOT ONE MORE SURPRISE.

13:14.533 --> 13:15.500
>> THESE TWO PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY

13:15.500 --> 13:16.133
DEPUTIES OF SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO'S

13:16.133 --> 13:16.900
OFFICE.

13:16.900 --> 13:18.100
>> TAKE 'EM DOWN,

13:18.100 --> 13:19.166
TAKE 'EM DOWN.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.500
>> SO DUDE, YOU GOTTA SMILE,

13:20.500 --> 13:28.533
'CAUSE YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!

13:28.533 --> 13:29.633
>> OH!

13:29.633 --> 13:30.000
FOR REAL!

13:30.000 --> 13:30.867
FOR REAL!

13:30.867 --> 13:35.900
WHOOMP, THERE IT IS!

13:35.900 --> 13:36.967
>> John: WAIT.

13:36.967 --> 13:37.834
"WHOOMP THERE IT IS."

13:37.834 --> 13:38.867
FOR THE RECORD, EVEN THEN,

13:38.867 --> 13:42.633
THAT REFERENCE WAS 15 YEARS OLD,

13:42.633 --> 13:44.233
WHICH IS A REAL WIGGITY-WACK

13:44.233 --> 13:44.834
THING TO DO.

13:44.834 --> 13:45.667
AND TRICKING PEOPLE INTO ARREST

13:45.667 --> 13:46.266
FOR YOUR OWN AMUSEMENT

13:46.266 --> 13:46.867
IS A TERRIBLE IDEA

13:46.867 --> 13:48.367
FOR A REALITY SHOW.

13:48.367 --> 13:50.367
THE ONLY WORSE IDEA

13:50.367 --> 13:55.600
IS "NOT MAKING

13:55.600 --> 13:58.967
PETER THE BACHELOR.

13:58.967 --> 14:00.033
LOOK AT THAT FACE.

14:00.033 --> 14:00.700
ARE YOU IDIOTS?

14:00.700 --> 14:01.300
LET ME JUST SAY THIS.

14:01.300 --> 14:01.934
PETER, IF YOU'RE OUT THERE,

14:01.934 --> 14:02.567
YOU ARE AND SHALL EVER REMAIN

14:02.567 --> 14:04.066
MY BACHELOR.

14:04.066 --> 14:05.433
#Peterismybachelor.

14:05.433 --> 14:07.433
#Hesacatchelor.

14:07.433 --> 14:08.867
ARPAIO WILL DO ANYTHING

14:08.867 --> 14:09.734
FOR A CAMERA.

14:09.734 --> 14:10.867
AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,

14:10.867 --> 14:11.500
WATCH HIM SING HIS FAVORITE

14:11.500 --> 14:13.233
SONG, WHICH IS OF COURSE

14:13.233 --> 14:16.200
FRANK SINATRA'S "MY WAY,"

14:16.200 --> 14:17.500
THE UNIVERSAL ANTHEM OF ASSHOLES

14:17.500 --> 14:19.066
EVERYWHERE, FOR A DOCUMENTARY

14:19.066 --> 14:21.400
FILM CREW.

14:21.400 --> 14:24.900
>> ♪ THE RECORD SHOWS ♪

14:24.900 --> 14:30.166
♪ I TOOK THE BLOWS ♪

14:30.166 --> 14:38.900
♪ AND DID IT MY WAY ♪

14:38.900 --> 14:39.667
>> John: HERE'S SOMETHING

14:39.667 --> 14:39.967
INTERESTING.

14:39.967 --> 14:40.700
WHEN FRANK SINATRA HEARD THAT,

14:40.700 --> 14:44.600
HE ACTUALLY CLIMBED OUT OF HIS

14:44.600 --> 14:45.300
GRAVE, WALKED 400 MILES

14:45.300 --> 14:45.700
TO ARPAIO'S HOUSE,

14:45.700 --> 14:46.333
RANG THE DOORBELL,

14:46.333 --> 14:49.500
AND SIMPLY SAID, "NO."

14:49.500 --> 14:50.700
BUT WHAT DOES "DOING IT ARPAIO'S

14:50.700 --> 14:52.734
WAY" ACTUALLY MEAN?

14:52.734 --> 14:53.633
BECAUSE TRUMP DIDN'T JUST PARDON

14:53.633 --> 14:54.500
HIM.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.000
HE TOUTED ARPAIO'S SUPPORT

14:56.000 --> 14:57.133
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL,

14:57.133 --> 14:58.500
EVEN HAVING HIM SPEAK

14:58.500 --> 14:59.700
AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.333
SO TRUMP CLEARLY DOESN'T SEEM TO

15:01.333 --> 15:02.166
HAVE ANY REAL PROBLEM WITH

15:02.166 --> 15:03.333
"ARPAIO'S WAY."

15:03.333 --> 15:05.233
AND FOR THE RECORD, IT IS FAR

15:05.233 --> 15:06.834
MORE THAN JUST THE EYE-CATCHING

15:06.834 --> 15:08.500
CIRCUS YOU'VE SEEN SO FAR.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.066
AND MANY PEOPLE WERE AFFECTED.

15:10.066 --> 15:11.433
MARICOPA COUNTY, WHERE HE WAS

15:11.433 --> 15:12.433
THE SHERIFF UNTIL JUST LAST

15:12.433 --> 15:14.300
YEAR, CONTAINS OVER

15:14.300 --> 15:15.500
4 MILLION PEOPLE.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.800
THAT'S A HIGHER POPULATION

15:16.800 --> 15:18.800
THAN THAT OF 24 STATES.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.333
AND CONDITIONS IN HIS

15:20.333 --> 15:20.800
TENT CITY WEREN'T JUST

15:20.800 --> 15:26.100
ECCENTRIC, THEY WERE APPALLING.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.400
TEMPERATURES GOT TO 140 DEGREES

15:28.400 --> 15:29.066
FOOD WAS LIMITED TO TWO MEALS

15:29.066 --> 15:29.800
A DAY.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.200
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.133
>> CHINESE LAW ENFORCEMENT

15:32.133 --> 15:34.066
OFFICIALS DROP IN FOR SOME TIPS

15:34.066 --> 15:36.100
FROM JOE, WHO JUST BRUSHED UP

15:36.100 --> 15:37.934
ON HIS MANDARIN.

15:37.934 --> 15:40.266
>> I HEAR CHINA VERY TOUGH

15:40.266 --> 15:43.467
ON CRIMINAL, CORRECT, HUH?

15:43.467 --> 15:45.433
I'M ASKING THEM, "IN CHINA..."

15:45.433 --> 15:45.900
>> YES?

15:45.900 --> 15:48.967
>> DO THEY PUT WOMEN...

15:48.967 --> 15:49.800
ON A CHAIN GANG?

15:49.800 --> 15:51.367
>> NO.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.333
>> AH, THANK YOU.

15:52.333 --> 15:53.000
I AM STILL THE FIRST

15:53.000 --> 16:02.000
IN THE WORLD.

16:02.000 --> 16:02.934
>> John: YES, HE PUT WOMEN

16:02.934 --> 16:03.300
ON CHAIN GANGS.

16:03.300 --> 16:04.433
SO, I GUESS...

16:04.433 --> 16:05.100
#Feminism?

16:05.100 --> 16:07.467
IT'S A GRAY AREA.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.200
AND REMEMBER ARPAIO OPERATES

16:09.200 --> 16:10.533
JAILS, NOT PRISONS, WHICH ARE

16:10.533 --> 16:12.233
TYPICALLY FOR PEOPLE SERVING

16:12.233 --> 16:13.400
SENTENCES OF LESS THAN A YEAR

16:13.400 --> 16:16.467
OR EVEN JUST AWAITING TRIAL.

16:16.467 --> 16:18.400
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY ANY

16:18.400 --> 16:19.200
PRISONERS SHOULD BE SUBJECTED

16:19.200 --> 16:20.100
TO SOME OF ARPAIO'S TREATMENT.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.100
AT ONE POINT, HE ACTUALLY

16:21.100 --> 16:22.734
INSTALLED WEBCAMS IN THE JAIL,

16:22.734 --> 16:23.767
ONE OF WHICH SHOWED FEMALE

16:23.767 --> 16:24.967
INMATES USING THE TOILET,

16:24.967 --> 16:26.333
WHICH WOUND UP BEING LINKED TO

16:26.333 --> 16:28.667
BY PORNOGRAPHIC SITES.

16:28.667 --> 16:29.734
AND WHILE THE CAMERAS WERE

16:29.734 --> 16:31.367
PULLED, THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE

16:31.367 --> 16:32.533
DEFENDED THEMSELVES, WITH THEIR

16:32.533 --> 16:33.266
LAWYER SAYING THEY DID NOT SHOW

16:33.266 --> 16:34.800
THE PRIVATE PARTS OF ANY

16:34.800 --> 16:37.333
INMATES, AND "NO JUVENILES WOULD

16:37.333 --> 16:38.467
HAVE BEEN DISPLAYED" UNLESS

16:38.467 --> 16:45.066
THEY "LOOK OLDER AND LIE TO US."

16:45.066 --> 16:46.300
AND JUST SPARE A THOUGHT FOR THE

16:46.300 --> 16:48.300
ATTORNEY WHO WENT THROUGH YEARS

16:48.300 --> 16:49.333
OF LAW SCHOOL ONLY TO HAVE

16:49.333 --> 16:49.767
TO TELL A REPORTER,

16:49.767 --> 16:50.900
"DON'T WORRY.

16:50.900 --> 16:51.600
THE WOMEN WE BROADCAST TAKING

16:51.600 --> 16:52.200
A SHIT WERE PROBABLY

16:52.200 --> 16:54.300
ALL ADULTS."

16:54.300 --> 16:56.367
AND ARPAIO SEEMED ROUTINELY

16:56.367 --> 16:56.967
IMPERVIOUS TO CRITICISM

16:56.967 --> 16:58.467
OF ANY OF HIS TACTICS.

16:58.467 --> 16:59.667
>> I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MANY

16:59.667 --> 17:01.333
NEGATIVE COMMENTS, OTHER THAN

17:01.333 --> 17:03.033
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OR

17:03.033 --> 17:04.867
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL OR THE

17:04.867 --> 17:10.800
CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.600
>> John: YEAH, JOE, BUT THOSE

17:12.600 --> 17:13.900
ARE THE THREE KEY GROUPS WHO

17:13.900 --> 17:15.233
MIGHT CRITICIZE YOU OVER

17:15.233 --> 17:16.400
MISTREATING PRISONERS.

17:16.400 --> 17:16.867
SO YOU JUST WENT THREE

17:16.867 --> 17:17.467
FOR THREE.

17:17.467 --> 17:18.033
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET

17:18.033 --> 17:19.000
COMPLAINTS FROM

17:19.000 --> 17:20.100
CARL'S JUNIOR, THE GIRL SCOUTS,

17:20.100 --> 17:22.934
AND HOOTIE AND THE BLOWFISH.

17:22.934 --> 17:24.700
THAT'S NOT WHAT THOSE GROUPS DO.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.066
IS IT ANY WONDER THAT, WHEN

17:26.066 --> 17:27.100
A REPORTER ASKED INMATES WHETHER

17:27.100 --> 17:28.467
ARPAIO HAD ANY NICKNAMES,

17:28.467 --> 17:29.967
ONE RESPONDED, "HITLER,"

17:29.967 --> 17:31.400
WHILE ANOTHER RESPONDED,

17:31.400 --> 17:35.467
"HITLER."

17:35.467 --> 17:36.900
THAT IS A CHARGE HE'S DEFENDED

17:36.900 --> 17:37.633
HIMSELF AGAINST BY SAYING,

17:37.633 --> 17:38.300
"MY DAUGHTER HAS ADOPTED

17:38.300 --> 17:39.300
CHILDREN OF VARIOUS

17:39.300 --> 17:40.600
ETHNICITIES...

17:40.600 --> 17:42.500
I GOT A BLACK, A MEXICAN WITH

17:42.500 --> 17:43.900
DOWN SYNDROME EVEN.

17:43.900 --> 17:45.133
AND YET I'M THE RACIST.

17:45.133 --> 17:45.900
I'M THE FASCIST.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.066
I'M THE HITLER!"

17:47.066 --> 17:47.834
AND LOOK, I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE

17:47.834 --> 17:49.633
WITH HIM THERE.

17:49.633 --> 17:52.266
THAT'S JUST SOUND LOGIC.

17:52.266 --> 17:52.934
THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU PLAY

17:52.934 --> 17:54.033
THE BOARD GAME

17:54.033 --> 17:55.567
"GUESS WHO'S THE HITLER,"

17:55.567 --> 17:56.633
THE FIRST THINGS YOU ASK TO

17:56.633 --> 17:58.066
NARROW IT DOWN ARE "DO THEIR

17:58.066 --> 17:59.333
DAUGHTER GOT A BLACK?"

17:59.333 --> 18:01.166
AND "DO THEIR DAUGHTER GOT

18:01.166 --> 18:01.900
A MEXICAN WITH DOWN SYNDROME

18:01.900 --> 18:03.100
EVEN?"

18:03.100 --> 18:04.834
BECAUSE IF THEIR DAUGHTER GOT

18:04.834 --> 18:05.900
THOSE, THEY CAN'T BE THE HITLER!

18:05.900 --> 18:11.066
IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE RULES!

18:11.066 --> 18:12.900
AND LOOK, ARPAIO'S JAILS WEREN'T

18:12.900 --> 18:14.667
JUST TOUGH AND HUMILIATING.

18:14.667 --> 18:15.800
THEY WERE SOMETIMES DEADLY.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.000
OVER THE YEARS, THE COUNTY

18:17.000 --> 18:17.734
HAS PAID OUT MULTIPLE

18:17.734 --> 18:19.633
LARGE SETTLEMENTS TO FAMILIES OF

18:19.633 --> 18:20.834
INMATES WHO'VE DIED FOLLOWING

18:20.834 --> 18:22.166
INCIDENTS IN HIS FACILITIES,

18:22.166 --> 18:24.066
INCLUDING OVER $8 MILLION

18:24.066 --> 18:25.667
TO THE FAMILY OF SCOTT NORBERG,

18:25.667 --> 18:27.100
WHO DIED IN CUSTODY AFTER BEING

18:27.100 --> 18:27.834
RESTRAINED, SHOCKED,

18:27.834 --> 18:29.400
AND BEATEN BY GUARDS.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.734
AND WHEN ONE OFFICER TRIED TO

18:30.734 --> 18:32.767
WARN TWO OTHER GUARDS THAT

18:32.767 --> 18:34.400
THE INMATE WAS IN DIRE TROUBLE,

18:34.400 --> 18:36.900
THEIR RESPONSE WAS CHILLING.

18:36.900 --> 18:38.667
>> I TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS

18:38.667 --> 18:41.900
TURNING BLUE AND/OR PURPLE.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.367
I DON'T THINK HE WAS BREATHING.

18:43.367 --> 18:46.667
AND HE SAID "WHO GIVES A FUCK?"

18:46.667 --> 18:48.100
>> AFTER SPIDELL RESPONDED

18:48.100 --> 18:49.567
TO YOU "WHO GIVES A FUCK?"

18:49.567 --> 18:53.734
AND YOU WARNED OFFICER GURNEY,

18:53.734 --> 18:56.734
WHAT DID MR. GURNEY SAY?

18:56.734 --> 18:57.633
>> THEY SAID, JUST,

18:57.633 --> 18:58.767
"WHO GIVES A SHIT?"

18:58.767 --> 19:00.300
>> John: YOU CAN'T SEE SOMEONE

19:00.300 --> 19:02.333
DYING AND SAY WHO GIVES A SHIT.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.000
YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE SOME THING

19:04.000 --> 19:05.934
DYING AND SAY THAT.

19:05.934 --> 19:06.533
WITH THE SOLE EXCEPTION

19:06.533 --> 19:12.066
OF ORCHIDS.

19:12.066 --> 19:12.934
WHO GIVES A SHIT?

19:12.934 --> 19:13.533
THEY'RE HIGH MAINTENANCE

19:13.533 --> 19:15.367
LITTLE FLOWER CUCKS

19:15.367 --> 19:17.133
AND THEY ALL DESERVE TO DIE.

19:17.133 --> 19:22.767
NOW, I SHOULD TELL YOU THE U.S.

19:22.767 --> 19:24.767
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO DECLINED

19:24.767 --> 19:27.600
TO PROSECUTE THE CASE.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.000
AND BOTH ARPAIO AND THE OFFICERS

19:29.000 --> 19:29.700
INSIST THEY DID NOTHING WRONG.

19:29.700 --> 19:30.300
IN FACT, ARPAIO WAS SO

19:30.300 --> 19:30.967
UNAPOLOGETIC THAT BOTH OFFICER

19:30.967 --> 19:31.567
"WHO GIVES A FUCK" AND OFFICER

19:31.567 --> 19:32.166
"WHO GIVES A SHIT" WERE LATER

19:32.166 --> 19:33.767
PROMOTED.

19:33.767 --> 19:34.500
PRESUMABLY TO LIEUTENANT

19:34.500 --> 19:35.133
"WHATEVER, ASSHOLE" AND SERGEANT

19:35.133 --> 19:37.100
"ZERO FUCKS GIVEN."

19:37.100 --> 19:38.166
AND THAT PROMOTION SENDS

19:38.166 --> 19:39.233
A PRETTY CLEAR MESSAGE

19:39.233 --> 19:40.633
TO ARPAIO'S STAFF.

19:40.633 --> 19:41.967
ALMOST AS CLEAR A MESSAGE AS

19:41.967 --> 19:43.166
A PRESIDENT PARDONING THE MAN

19:43.166 --> 19:45.867
WHO OVERSAW ALL THIS.

19:45.867 --> 19:47.066
AND REMEMBER, ARPAIO WASN'T JUST

19:47.066 --> 19:48.467
IN CHARGE OF JAILS.

19:48.467 --> 19:49.734
HE WAS ALSO A LAW ENFORCEMENT

19:49.734 --> 19:54.400
OFFICER, AND SOME OF HIS ACTIONS

19:54.400 --> 19:57.000
-- HIS RESPECT FOR THE LAW

19:57.000 --> 19:59.900
SEEMED AWFULLY SELECTIVE.

19:59.900 --> 20:00.633
OVER THE YEARS, HIS OFFICE

20:00.633 --> 20:01.266
REPEATEDLY LAUNCHED CRIMINAL

20:01.266 --> 20:01.900
CASES AGAINST HIS PERCEIVED

20:01.900 --> 20:02.500
ENEMIES, BE THEY COUNTY

20:02.500 --> 20:03.233
OFFICIALS OR EVEN JUDGES.

20:03.233 --> 20:03.867
SOME OF WHICH WERE SHOCKINGLY

20:03.867 --> 20:10.233
FLIMSY, WITH ONE BEING

20:10.233 --> 20:11.834
DISMISSED OR THROWN OUT.

20:11.834 --> 20:13.967
ONE WAS SO BASELESS IT WAS CITED

20:13.967 --> 20:15.400
IN THE DISBARMENT OF THE

20:15.400 --> 20:16.834
ATTORNEY WHO BROUGHT IT WITH A

20:16.834 --> 20:19.333
MEMBER OF THE PANEL SAYING IT

20:19.333 --> 20:21.367
WAS "NOTHING SHORT OF FUMBLING

20:21.367 --> 20:23.633
WITH THE LAW LIKE CHILDREN

20:23.633 --> 20:25.800
WIELDING A BUZZING CHAINSAW."

20:25.800 --> 20:26.667
WHICH IS NOT ONLY AN AMAZING

20:26.667 --> 20:27.333
STATEMENT, IT'S ALSO MY FAVORITE

20:27.333 --> 20:28.700
PRECIOUS MOMENTS FIGURINE.

20:28.700 --> 20:29.266
AND FOR "AMERICA'S TOUGHEST

20:29.266 --> 20:31.600
SHERIFF," ARPAIO SEEMED TO LET

20:31.600 --> 20:32.333
CERTAIN CRIMES FALL THROUGH

20:32.333 --> 20:33.667
THE CRACKS.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.166
IN 2011, IT CAME OUT THAT

20:35.166 --> 20:36.567
HIS DEPARTMENT HAD FAILED

20:36.567 --> 20:38.533
TO PROPERLY INVESTIGATE MORE

20:38.533 --> 20:40.333
THAN 400 SEX CRIMES, SOME OF

20:40.333 --> 20:41.667
WHICH INVOLVED CHILDREN.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.567
AND WHILE ARPAIO EVENTUALLY

20:43.567 --> 20:45.066
ADMITTED TO THAT, HIS APOLOGY

20:45.066 --> 20:48.233
LEFT A LOT TO BE DESIRED.

20:48.233 --> 20:49.767
>> IF THERE WERE ANY VICTIMS OUT

20:49.767 --> 20:53.133
THERE, I APOLOGIZE TO THOSE

20:53.133 --> 20:54.266
VICTIMS.

20:54.266 --> 20:58.200
IF THERE WERE ANY.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.200
>> John: HOLD ON.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.567
"IF" THERE WERE ANY?

21:02.567 --> 21:05.700
THERE WERE, WE KNOW THAT.

21:05.700 --> 21:06.734
THAT IS A CASUAL INDIFFERENCE

21:06.734 --> 21:07.266
TO OVERLOOKING SEX CRIMES

21:07.266 --> 21:09.000
SO EGREGIOUS, I'M GENUINELY

21:09.000 --> 21:09.533
SURPRISED THERE'S NOT

21:09.533 --> 21:09.934
A STATUE OF ARPAIO

21:09.934 --> 21:12.066
AT PENN STATE.

21:12.066 --> 21:13.700
AND AMAZINGLY, NONE OF WHAT

21:13.700 --> 21:14.700
YOU'VE JUST SEEN -- NOT THE

21:14.700 --> 21:16.133
CONDITIONS, NOT THE DEATHS,

21:16.133 --> 21:17.400
NOT THE BASELESS CHARGES

21:17.400 --> 21:18.367
AGAINST HIS CRITICS --

21:18.367 --> 21:19.900
HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHY

21:19.900 --> 21:20.800
HE WAS CONVICTED AND NEEDED

21:20.800 --> 21:22.133
A PARDON.

21:22.133 --> 21:24.333
THAT STEMS FROM RACIAL PROFILING

21:24.333 --> 21:25.133
WHICH HIS DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN

21:25.133 --> 21:26.100
REPEATEDLY ACCUSED OF

21:26.100 --> 21:27.533
OVER THE YEARS.

21:27.533 --> 21:30.333
AND ONE HUGE INVESTIGATION FOUND

21:30.333 --> 21:31.633
SOME TROUBLING DETAILS.

21:31.633 --> 21:32.500
>> A THREE-YEAR INVESTIGATION

21:32.500 --> 21:33.934
BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOUND

21:33.934 --> 21:35.633
WHAT IT CALLED "UNCONSTITUTIONAL

21:35.633 --> 21:37.400
POLICING" AND A "PERVASIVE

21:37.400 --> 21:38.834
CULTURE OF DISCRIMINATORY BIAS

21:38.834 --> 21:41.066
AGAINST LATINOS," WHO ARE

21:41.066 --> 21:42.667
UP TO NINE TIMES MORE LIKELY

21:42.667 --> 21:44.467
THAN WHITES TO BE STOPPED BY

21:44.467 --> 21:49.100
A MARICOPA COUNTY DEPUTY.

21:49.100 --> 21:49.767
IN ONE INCIDENT CITED IN THE

21:49.767 --> 21:50.700
FEDERAL REPORT, A HISPANIC

21:50.700 --> 21:51.433
DRIVER WAS INCARCERATED FOR 13

21:51.433 --> 21:52.934
DAYS BEFORE HIS CITATION WAS

21:52.934 --> 21:55.200
DISMISSED FOR NOT USING HIS TURN

21:55.200 --> 22:02.467
SIGNAL.

22:02.467 --> 22:03.567
>> John: THINK ABOUT THAT.

22:03.567 --> 22:04.000
13 DAYS FOR A TURN

22:04.000 --> 22:04.400
SIGNAL INFRACTION!

22:04.400 --> 22:05.100
AND THAT'S IN ARIZONA, WHERE

22:05.100 --> 22:05.900
AN OLD PERSON DRIVING WITH THEIR

22:05.900 --> 22:07.100
TURN SIGNAL ON IS LITERALLY

22:07.100 --> 22:13.367
THE STATE SEAL.

22:13.367 --> 22:15.433
IN 2011, ARPAIO'S

22:15.433 --> 22:16.000
PATTERN OF RACIAL PROFILING

22:16.000 --> 22:17.367
RESULTED IN THIS.

22:17.367 --> 22:18.100
>> A FEDERAL COURT IN PHOENIX

22:18.100 --> 22:19.567
HAS DECIDED ARIZONA AUTHORITIES

22:19.567 --> 22:20.934
CANNOT ARREST PEOPLE SUSPECTED

22:20.934 --> 22:22.400
OF BEING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

22:22.400 --> 22:23.333
SOLELY BECAUSE OF THEIR

22:23.333 --> 22:24.500
APPEARANCE.

22:24.500 --> 22:25.600
>> IF ARPAIO DOES NOT COMPLY

22:25.600 --> 22:27.233
WITH THE COURT RULING,

22:27.233 --> 22:28.367
ARPAIO COULD ULTIMATELY BE HELD

22:28.367 --> 22:29.800
IN CONTEMPT OF COURT AND FACE

22:29.800 --> 22:31.800
JAIL TIME.

22:31.800 --> 22:32.600
>> John: YOU'LL NEVER GUESS

22:32.600 --> 22:34.166
WHAT HAPPENED.

22:34.166 --> 22:35.567
ARPAIO DID NOT COMPLY

22:35.567 --> 22:37.066
WITH THE COURT RULING.

22:37.066 --> 22:38.500
IN FACT, OVER THE NEXT 18 MONTHS

22:38.500 --> 22:40.133
HIS OFFICE DETAINED AT LEAST

22:40.133 --> 22:42.066
171 PEOPLE WITHOUT CHARGE

22:42.066 --> 22:43.467
AND TURNED THEM OVER

22:43.467 --> 22:45.333
TO IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT.

22:45.333 --> 22:46.300
AND LAST JULY,

22:46.300 --> 22:47.667
A FEDERAL JUDGE FOUND ARPAIO

22:47.667 --> 22:50.000
GUILTY OF CRIMINAL CONTEMPT.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.266
AND AT THAT POINT,

22:51.266 --> 22:53.266
HE WAS A CRIMINAL.

22:53.266 --> 22:54.166
HE HAD COMMITTED AND WAS

22:54.166 --> 22:55.867
CONVICTED OF A CRIME.

22:55.867 --> 22:59.867
THE THING THAT

22:59.867 --> 23:00.767
THE PEOPLE HE PUTS IN TENTS

23:00.767 --> 23:01.900
AND PINK UNDERWEAR HAD DONE,

23:01.900 --> 23:02.533
AND WHICH HE FELT MEANT THEY'D

23:02.533 --> 23:05.333
FORFEITED ANY RIGHT TO COMPLAIN.

23:05.333 --> 23:05.734
HE HAD DONE THAT.

23:05.734 --> 23:07.133
AND HE HADN'T EVEN BEEN

23:07.133 --> 23:07.867
SENTENCED BEFORE TRUMP STARTED

23:07.867 --> 23:09.300
HINTING AT A PARDON

23:09.300 --> 23:11.133
FOR AN INCREDIBLE REASON.

23:11.133 --> 23:14.300
>> WAS SHERIFF JOE CONVICTED FOR

23:14.300 --> 23:15.633
DOING HIS JOB?

23:15.633 --> 23:17.867
THAT'S WHAT --

23:17.867 --> 23:19.233
YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:19.233 --> 23:20.533
I'LL MAKE A PREDICTION.

23:20.533 --> 23:21.100
I THINK HE'S GOING TO BE

23:21.100 --> 23:21.767
JUST FINE.

23:21.767 --> 23:24.533
OKAY?

23:24.533 --> 23:26.433
>> John: BUT HERE'S THE THING.

23:26.433 --> 23:27.700
HE ABSOLUTELY WASN'T JUST

23:27.700 --> 23:28.734
DOING HIS JOB.

23:28.734 --> 23:30.066
HE WAS ALSO DOING SOMETHING

23:30.066 --> 23:31.533
ILLEGAL.

23:31.533 --> 23:32.567
YOU WOULDN'T SAY

23:32.567 --> 23:34.333
JOHN WAYNE GACY WAS "JUST DOING

23:34.333 --> 23:36.100
HIS JOB" EVEN THOUGH HE WAS,

23:36.100 --> 23:37.533
BY ALL ACCOUNTS, A PRETTY GOOD

23:37.533 --> 23:39.567
BIRTHDAY CLOWN.

23:39.567 --> 23:40.700
IT'S THE STUFF HE WAS DOING

23:40.700 --> 23:41.533
ON TOP OF THAT

23:41.533 --> 23:43.767
THAT NEEDED ADDRESSING.

23:43.767 --> 23:46.233
AND YET, I DON'T DOUBT TRUMP

23:46.233 --> 23:47.133
THINKS THAT EVERYTHING

23:47.133 --> 23:48.967
JOE ARPAIO DID WAS OR SHOULD BE

23:48.967 --> 23:49.834
PART OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT

23:49.834 --> 23:51.266
OFFICER'S JOB.

23:51.266 --> 23:54.734
AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM HERE.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.033
THAT'S WHY THIS PARDON IS A SLAP

23:56.033 --> 23:57.667
IN THE FACE TO LATINOS

23:57.667 --> 23:58.834
THAT ARPAIO AND HIS DEPARTMENT

23:58.834 --> 24:03.100
UNCONSTITUTIONALLY TARGETED.

24:03.100 --> 24:05.066
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S A SLAP IN

24:05.066 --> 24:06.367
THE FACE TO THE RULE OF LAW.

24:06.367 --> 24:07.700
BECAUSE ARPAIO BROKE THE RULES

24:07.700 --> 24:08.900
HE WAS SWORN TO UPHOLD,

24:08.900 --> 24:09.567
RULES THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE

24:09.567 --> 24:11.000
TO PROTECT CITIZENS FROM A

24:11.000 --> 24:12.700
GOVERNMENT GOING OUT OF CONTROL.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.133
AND TRUMP GIVING HIM A PASS,

24:14.133 --> 24:15.700
AFTER EVERYTHING YOU'VE SEEN

24:15.700 --> 24:16.867
TONIGHT, AND SAYING HE WAS

24:16.867 --> 24:19.533
"JUST DOING HIS JOB" IS A LOUD

24:19.533 --> 24:21.600
CONFIRMATION THAT,

24:21.600 --> 24:23.166
AT LEAST AS FAR AS THIS

24:23.166 --> 24:24.200
WHITE HOUSE IS CONCERNED,

24:24.200 --> 24:24.900
FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS,

24:24.900 --> 24:25.900
LAW ENFORCEMENT WON'T

24:25.900 --> 24:27.400
NECESSARILY BE EXPECTED TO DO

24:27.400 --> 24:28.633
THEIR JOBS THE WAY THE

24:28.633 --> 24:29.800
CONSTITUTION OR THE COURTS

24:29.800 --> 24:31.333
SAY THEY SHOULD.

24:31.333 --> 24:32.567
INSTEAD, LIKE SHERIFF

24:32.567 --> 24:35.367
JOE ARPAIO, THEY SHOULD FEEL

24:35.367 --> 24:37.567
FREE TO THEIR JOB --

QUICK WORD

25:22.600 --> 25:23.300
REGARDING TRAINS.

25:23.300 --> 25:25.900
OR, AS I CALL THEM,

25:25.900 --> 25:26.967
"GROUND PLANES."

25:26.967 --> 25:27.567
YOU MAY REMEMBER, ONE OF

25:27.567 --> 25:28.633
OUR RECENT "AND NOW" SEGMENTS

25:28.633 --> 25:29.367
CONCERNED SCRANTON,

25:29.367 --> 25:30.533
PENNSYLVANIA'S WNEP.

25:30.533 --> 25:31.600
MORE SPECIFICALLY,

25:31.600 --> 25:32.934
THEIR BACKYARD TRAIN THAT RUNS

25:32.934 --> 25:33.900
BEHIND THEIR WEATHER FORECASTERS

25:33.900 --> 25:35.467
ALL YEAR 'ROUND.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.133
IT'S A CHARMING FEATURE OF THAT

25:37.133 --> 25:38.533
NEWSCAST, AND THE PEOPLE OF

25:38.533 --> 25:41.133
SCRANTON HAVE A LOT OF OPINIONS

25:41.133 --> 25:42.166
ABOUT IT, REGULARLY CALLING IN

25:42.166 --> 25:43.166
DURING THEIR "TALK BACK"

25:43.166 --> 25:48.233
SEGMENT.

25:48.233 --> 25:49.100
>> TALK BACK CALLERS SEEM TO BE

25:49.100 --> 25:49.734
PRETTY MUCH OBSESSED WITH THE

25:49.734 --> 25:50.233
TRAIN AND TROLLY IN OUR

25:50.233 --> 25:50.934
BACKYARD.

25:50.934 --> 25:52.734
>> I WOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW

25:52.734 --> 25:54.300
WHOSE IDEA IT WAS TO PUT A TRAIN

25:54.300 --> 25:55.900
IN THE BACKYARD.

25:55.900 --> 25:58.033
>> I'M CALLING ABOUT YOUR TRAIN.

25:58.033 --> 25:59.734
WHOO, WOOO!

25:59.734 --> 26:02.166
KEEP THE TRAIN ROLLING, BABY!

26:02.166 --> 26:04.233
>> QUESTION: WHAT IS GOING ON

26:04.233 --> 26:05.467
WITH THE TRAIN.

26:05.467 --> 26:06.700
WHY ISN'T IT RUNNING?

26:06.700 --> 26:07.467
IT HASN'T BEEN RUNNING

26:07.467 --> 26:08.900
IN WEEKS.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.000
>> WAAH, WAAH, WAAH,

26:10.000 --> 26:11.800
THE TRAIN'S NOT RUNNING.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.100
I WISH SNEDEKER WOULD PUT

26:13.100 --> 26:13.700
A QUARTER-STICK IN THAT TRAIN

26:13.700 --> 26:21.233
AND BLOW IT UP.

26:21.233 --> 26:22.033
>> John: WHOA.

26:22.033 --> 26:22.633
THAT LEVEL OF EMOTIONAL

26:22.633 --> 26:23.333
INVESTMENT IN A TOY TRAIN SET

26:23.333 --> 26:24.533
IS USUALLY ONLY EXPERIENCED BY

26:24.533 --> 26:25.033
MIDDLE-AGED DADS WHO ARE

26:25.033 --> 26:25.567
DIVORCED OR ABOUT TO GET

26:25.567 --> 26:28.100
DIVORCED.

26:28.100 --> 26:29.567
WELL, IT TURNS OUT, THE PEOPLE

26:29.567 --> 26:31.500
OF SCRANTON SAW OUR SEGMENT.

26:31.500 --> 26:32.533
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS

26:32.533 --> 26:33.367
THIS.

26:33.367 --> 26:34.367
>> OUR BACKYARD TRAIN GETTING

26:34.367 --> 26:35.500
SOME NATIONAL ATTENTION.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.867
SOME FOLKS LOVE IT, SOME FEEL

26:37.867 --> 26:38.967
IT'S AT OUR AREA'S EXPENSE.

26:38.967 --> 26:40.100
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:40.100 --> 26:43.967
I JUST WATCHED THIS JOHN OLIVER

26:43.967 --> 26:46.300
TRAIN CONTROVERSY.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.200
THIS GUY -- WE'RE NOT -

26:47.200 --> 26:48.667
WE'RE NOT CLOWNS FOR HIS

26:48.667 --> 26:50.266
ENTERTAINMENT.

26:50.266 --> 26:51.934
I THINK THIS GUY OWES US

26:51.934 --> 26:54.934
AN APOLOGY HERE IN NE PA.

26:54.934 --> 26:56.133
>> John: HEY, HEY, HEY!

26:56.133 --> 26:57.467
FIRST, LET ME BE CLEAR

26:57.467 --> 26:58.500
I DON'T THINK THE RESIDENTS

26:58.500 --> 26:59.100
OF SCRANTON ARE "CLOWNS

26:59.100 --> 27:01.133
FOR MY ENTERTAINMENT."

27:01.133 --> 27:02.133
I DON'T THINK CLOWNS ARE

27:02.133 --> 27:04.800
FOR ENTERTAINMENT AT ALL.

27:04.800 --> 27:05.567
THEY'RE FOR MURDER THREATS,

27:05.567 --> 27:06.600
ATTEMPTED MURDER

27:06.600 --> 27:10.166
AND ACTUAL MURDER.

27:10.166 --> 27:11.000
THAT'S IT.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.266
THAT'S WHAT CLOWNS ARE FOR.

27:13.266 --> 27:14.600
PLEASE DON'T THINK THAT I WAS

27:14.600 --> 27:15.200
MAKING FUN OF YOUR BACKYARD
