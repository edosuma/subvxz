00:49.960 --> 00:54.300
Frankie, how did the medicine cabinet
get into the couch?

00:54.380 --> 00:56.760
-Oh, don't ask.
-It's a simple question.

00:56.840 --> 01:01.850
Ah. I know, but the answer is complicated.
My majorette boots.

01:01.930 --> 01:03.770
Frankie, I'm not cleaning up after you.

01:03.850 --> 01:07.350
Or doing your dishes, that, by the way,
have been in the sink for two day--

01:07.440 --> 01:10.230
-Did you say majorette boots?
-Yes.

01:10.320 --> 01:14.490
There have been many Frankies,
as it turns out, in this lifetime alone.

01:14.570 --> 01:19.160
With many vaginas. There are four more
here than I ever needed to see.

01:19.240 --> 01:22.000
And my baton.

01:22.080 --> 01:25.500
This used to be my signature move.

01:25.580 --> 01:28.040
No, it's the pajamas that make it yours.

01:29.420 --> 01:32.050
Oh, my God, my old yearbook.

01:33.050 --> 01:35.630
Frankie, look at me. Look at me.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.470
Look at my face. My eyes. Good.

01:38.550 --> 01:41.140
I don't know what the division of labor
was in your marriage--

01:41.220 --> 01:43.020
Bud did most of the cleaning.

01:44.310 --> 01:47.520
Here, will you get a load of me
for a fat second?

01:47.600 --> 01:51.190
This girl is fearless.
She is a hurricane of vim and vigor

01:51.270 --> 01:53.230
and elastic skin.

01:53.320 --> 01:55.400
-"Dear Frances..."
-Frances?

01:55.490 --> 01:58.410
"You are a hoot. Remember me always,

01:58.490 --> 02:01.030
as I will remember you
and all our intrepid adventures.

02:01.120 --> 02:04.290
-Your Best Friend Forever, Donny."
-Oh, who's Donny?

02:04.370 --> 02:07.210
I'm not sure. I don't remember,
but I remember Frances.

02:07.290 --> 02:09.960
-Wait, "Frances Mengela"?
-Men-jella.

02:10.039 --> 02:14.460
It was an unfortunate last name.
It's the only reason I took Sol's.

02:14.550 --> 02:19.090
This is Frances eating a corn dog
on the hood of a Thunderbird.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.930
Oh, she's a daredevil.
She's plucky. She's adventurous.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.770
You're sitting on a parked car.

02:24.850 --> 02:28.520
I'm making a point.
You know how I've been looking everywhere

02:28.600 --> 02:31.610
for the new me,
and all the while she was here.

02:31.690 --> 02:35.320
The old me is the best new me.
<i>Vive la</i> Frances.

02:36.860 --> 02:38.990
That's the spirit.

02:39.070 --> 02:41.570
Come on, Grace.
Haven't you ever been anyone else?

02:41.660 --> 02:45.540
No, I am consistently the same person,
it's part of my schtick.

02:46.540 --> 02:50.210
I mean, wasn't there a best Grace?

02:51.250 --> 02:53.960
Well, once. Maybe.

02:54.050 --> 02:58.340
I know when. And I know who
brought the playful out in you.

02:58.420 --> 03:00.340
It rhymes with Brazil Milstein.

03:00.430 --> 03:04.300
Oh. His name is Phil. End of subject.

03:14.980 --> 03:19.280
Is that Usain Bolt? Oh no, it's my dad.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.820
Welcome home, Daddy.

03:20.910 --> 03:24.030
Thank you, sweetheart.
It's so good to be home.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.120
Come and relax.

03:26.660 --> 03:29.000
Ooh.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.500
What is that?

03:30.580 --> 03:32.170
It's a lift chair.

03:32.250 --> 03:35.170
Looks like it came from the pancake
restaurant where Death eats.

03:35.250 --> 03:39.550
OK. I know I got you an ugly present,
but, Dad, it's so practical.

03:39.630 --> 03:43.680
When you need to get up,
it raises you into a standing position.

03:46.850 --> 03:48.220
You're welcome.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.850
What this chair lacks in form,
it makes up for in function.

03:52.940 --> 03:55.690
It will save you
from straining your groin.

03:55.770 --> 03:58.610
Can we have five minutes
where no one mentions my groin?

03:58.690 --> 04:00.780
Send it back, please. I'm not an invalid.

04:00.860 --> 04:04.660
No one's saying you're an invalid,
we just want you to take it easy.

04:04.740 --> 04:07.700
And, look, it gives you a massage.

04:07.790 --> 04:10.660
No, it doesn't do that, Sol.
That was a hundred dollars more.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.580
-Oh.
-I'll give you $200 to put it on the curb.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.040
No...

04:16.290 --> 04:18.250
That would have been
so much easier with a lift.

04:18.339 --> 04:20.839
This is better.

04:24.090 --> 04:28.220
Grace! Grace,
you're not gonna believe what I did.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.140
You're gonna kiss me. Or not.

04:30.220 --> 04:33.480
Certainly not on the lips,
maybe about the head somewhere.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.190
-Or you might want to kick me out.
-Well, I'm not kissing you,

04:36.270 --> 04:38.320
so take all your vaginas
with you when you go.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.360
I found a Phil Milstein.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.030
I never asked you to look for Phil.

04:43.110 --> 04:47.320
I'm an amateur sleuth with
limited self-control and a computer.

04:47.410 --> 04:50.160
-It was a perfect storm.
-Is that my computer?

04:50.240 --> 04:54.040
Calm down. Mine's frozen.
I think by the FBI.

04:54.120 --> 04:58.040
It could be a virus, but either way,
best to lay low for a while.

04:59.050 --> 05:02.670
-I think I found your Phil.
-He's not my Phil.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.220
He never was.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.220
Well, is-is there a picture?

05:09.300 --> 05:12.640
Uh, no.
But his cover photo is a wet Rottweiler.

05:12.730 --> 05:15.480
He's a contractor
who was born in San Antonio.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.860
Oh, my God, it's him.

05:17.940 --> 05:19.480
I knew it!

05:19.570 --> 05:22.360
Now tell me what happened with you two.
Spill it, lady.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.820
No. No. I am not interested.

05:24.900 --> 05:29.080
Oh, right, why would you be interested
in the great love of your life?

05:29.160 --> 05:32.040
I'm gonna erase it,
my finger is on the eraser key.

05:32.120 --> 05:35.040
There is no eraser key.
Frankie, just forget it.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.790
It's not meant to be.

05:36.870 --> 05:41.300
I was with Robert.
Our timing was off. I had the girls.

05:41.380 --> 05:42.800
Please just drop it.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.170
Look, he lives in Mission Viejo,

05:45.260 --> 05:49.390
and he's passionate
about the national dam system.

05:49.470 --> 05:51.220
At least you have that in common.

05:52.100 --> 05:54.350
I haven't seen him in 15 years.

05:54.430 --> 05:58.020
If we get in the car right now,
we could see him by cocktail hour.

05:58.100 --> 06:01.440
I can find his address for $9.99.

06:01.520 --> 06:05.030
Give me your credit card. Oh, never mind,
I-I finally have it memorized.

06:06.070 --> 06:11.080
No, no, no. No! I cannot at 71 years old
drive to Mission Viejo,

06:11.160 --> 06:14.410
unannounced to...
for all intents and purposes,

06:14.490 --> 06:17.160
stalk a man I have no business contacting.

06:17.250 --> 06:18.620
Get in the car, Grace.

06:18.710 --> 06:22.300
You don't have to talk to him,
you can hide in the glove compartment.

06:22.380 --> 06:25.090
-You'd probably fit.
-I don't know.

06:25.170 --> 06:27.130
Come on, don't you wonder
what he looks like?

06:27.220 --> 06:28.760
What did he look like?

06:30.800 --> 06:33.600
I wonder if he still has his mustache.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.060
I wish you could see your eyes right now.

06:36.140 --> 06:38.350
I can imagine you at 18.

06:38.440 --> 06:42.230
- Oh, I like this Grace.
- Really?

06:42.320 --> 06:43.650
Mmm.

06:43.730 --> 06:46.110
I don't know. I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know.

06:46.190 --> 06:48.740
What is the worst that could happen?
That he's bald?

06:48.820 --> 06:52.490
That he still likes you? That he wants
to make a suit out of your skin?

06:52.570 --> 06:56.080
What? Oh, come on, let's do it.

06:57.700 --> 07:01.670
-OK!
-Ah, booyah! Ah.

07:01.750 --> 07:04.710
Oh, God. This is so fun.

07:04.800 --> 07:08.260
Ah, wait. Snacks for the road.

07:08.340 --> 07:11.590
-Frances can drive.
-Frances always drives.

07:11.680 --> 07:15.640
Once through a closed garage door, but...
nobody was hurt.

07:22.560 --> 07:26.030
You've done this before, haven't you?

07:26.110 --> 07:29.360
Please don't cross your legs,
the doctor said not to.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.990
The doctor also said
not to drive me crazy.

07:32.070 --> 07:36.080
-What?
-Nothing. Love you.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.250
Jeez.

07:42.750 --> 07:44.340
What is that?

07:44.420 --> 07:45.710
Look.

07:49.380 --> 07:50.670
-Oh, man.
-Right?

07:50.760 --> 07:53.010
What? What?

07:53.090 --> 07:55.470
I think these are the vows
that Robert wrote.

08:12.650 --> 08:16.450
Dad. Dad. Dad, sit up.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.950
- Dad. Sit up.
- Sit up. Sit up.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.000
He really loves me.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.170
He has no idea he married

08:24.250 --> 08:26.130
-a lying sack of shit.
-Shh.

08:28.130 --> 08:31.670
Come on, Grace. Hurry up! Hm.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.299
Coming. I'm coming.

08:33.380 --> 08:38.390
Are you aware that Mission Viejo is the
birthplace of Florence Griffith Joyner?

08:38.470 --> 08:40.559
Well, isn't that the cherry on top?

08:40.640 --> 08:45.020
If we take the side streets,
we can be there in about three hours,

08:45.100 --> 08:47.110
-but that's without pee breaks.
-Three hours?

08:47.190 --> 08:49.980
We're driving to Mission Viejo,
not the Middle East.

08:50.070 --> 08:52.610
It's an hour on the freeway with traffic.

08:52.690 --> 08:54.360
There are some things
you don't know about me.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.910
Well, I know about the charges
on my credit card.

08:56.990 --> 09:00.200
It's freeways. I'm terrified of them.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.790
Sol drove while I assumed
the crash position.

09:02.870 --> 09:05.170
-Fine. I'll drive drunk.
-No, no, no, no.

09:05.250 --> 09:08.000
-Frances always drives.
-Then drive!

09:08.090 --> 09:11.460
I'm about to remember
this is a terrible idea.

09:15.050 --> 09:16.430
Why do they all hate me?

09:16.510 --> 09:18.600
They hate you because
they want to go home.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.720
We've been sitting here 15 minutes.
You know, the idea is to merge.

09:21.810 --> 09:23.980
How do you get in? How do you do it?

09:24.060 --> 09:26.560
You put your foot on the long,
skinny pedal and push.

09:26.650 --> 09:27.900
It's not that hard.

09:27.980 --> 09:30.440
-Here's your window. Go, go. Go!
-I can't.

09:30.520 --> 09:33.780
It's like jump rope.
You pick your moment and jump in.

09:33.860 --> 09:36.240
No, but I broke
both my clavicles jumping rope.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.320
I had to spend the whole summer indoors.

09:38.410 --> 09:41.830
Oh, I wonder
if my-my pen pal Jordy is still alive.

09:41.910 --> 09:43.950
-Go, go. Frankie, go!
-My brain is sending the signal,

09:44.040 --> 09:47.210
-my foot's giving me the finger.
-Oh, grow some, Frances!

09:51.250 --> 09:52.630
It's a good day to die!

09:52.710 --> 09:54.710
Ah. Ahhh. Ah.

09:54.800 --> 09:55.630
Excuse me.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.590
Go.

09:59.680 --> 10:03.180
Look at me, Sol, you putz!

10:20.700 --> 10:22.450
Dad, this is amazing.

10:22.540 --> 10:24.660
I'm not doing anything
and I'm about to stand up.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.290
I'm almost up.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.210
-I'm up.
-Hey, Brianna, are these yours?

10:33.090 --> 10:34.960
You've been hiding cigars from me?

10:35.050 --> 10:37.970
I've never seen those Robustos
that you should handle carefully

10:38.050 --> 10:39.050
before in my life.

10:39.130 --> 10:41.300
Have you found his pork rind stash yet?

10:41.390 --> 10:42.850
- Brianna.
- His what?

10:44.100 --> 10:47.480
That ice bucket
came with those pork rinds in it.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.900
He used to keep Slim Jims
in the waffle maker.

10:49.980 --> 10:52.570
Remember that, Daddy?
'Member when you did that?

10:52.650 --> 10:55.480
Brianna, for the love of God,
will you give me some peace?

10:55.570 --> 10:57.440
Who hides junk food?
Fifteen-year-old girls.

10:57.530 --> 11:00.200
And 30-year-old men do sometimes,
when they're sad.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.030
What else are you hiding from me?

11:02.120 --> 11:05.370
It's just a stash, that's all. Please.

11:05.450 --> 11:07.950
Can I not keep one thing
that brings me joy?

11:08.040 --> 11:10.920
-No. Find joy elsewhere.
-I'd like to find joy elsewhere.

11:12.420 --> 11:15.550
-You're hiding alcohol, too?
-No, that's Mom's stash.

11:15.630 --> 11:17.260
I'll get that to her.

11:17.340 --> 11:21.010
-I'm gonna help Bri get that to her.
-I'm gonna be their designated driver.

11:22.300 --> 11:26.970
Of course, you guys have been
so great through this whole thing.

11:27.060 --> 11:29.480
You need to get on with your own lives.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.730
Please, don't go! Please.

11:31.810 --> 11:35.440
I'm not ready to be alone with him.
Not yet. Not in our home.

11:35.520 --> 11:40.280
Every time he looks at me...
he trusts me.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.530
I can't take it.

11:41.610 --> 11:43.450
You're gonna have to be alone
with him sometime, Dad.

11:43.530 --> 11:46.740
-We can't move in.
-I know. I'm being crazy.

11:46.830 --> 11:50.370
Yeah. Turn around,
walk back into the kitchen.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.670
Calm down, you'll be fine.

11:58.130 --> 11:59.800
String cheese?

12:00.550 --> 12:05.390
String cheese?
Are you out of your mind?

12:06.600 --> 12:09.270
OK, everybody back in.

12:10.140 --> 12:14.270
It's cheese! It'll shoot through
your arteries, slam into your heart,

12:14.350 --> 12:16.320
and blow you right into the driveway!

12:18.860 --> 12:20.440
It's part skim.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.040
How did you meet him?

12:30.830 --> 12:34.250
I was just thinking how nice it was that
we'd reached a point in our relationship

12:34.330 --> 12:37.090
where we can sit in a car and not talk.

12:37.170 --> 12:39.210
You don't want to talk to me
about Phil, fine.

12:39.300 --> 12:43.550
How about I tell you about my theory on
how the government controls the weather?

12:43.630 --> 12:48.600
He was the contractor who did my kitchen.
We became friends.

12:48.680 --> 12:52.060
And then we met by chance
one Friday after work.

12:52.140 --> 12:54.060
Was he married, too?

12:54.140 --> 12:57.690
He was.
A few years ago, I heard he got divorced.

12:57.770 --> 13:01.740
Ooh, the plot thickens.
How long did it go on?

13:01.820 --> 13:05.450
It never really got started.
If it had, I wouldn't be here.

13:05.530 --> 13:10.120
Well, that would be sad for me.
But then I could get a hedgehog.

13:10.200 --> 13:14.080
Mm.

13:25.220 --> 13:27.890
-You've got company.
-I do?

13:29.220 --> 13:32.390
-Oh, that's not for me.
-Well, who else is it for?

13:32.470 --> 13:33.980
There's nobody else on the road.

13:34.060 --> 13:35.940
No, thank you!

13:37.020 --> 13:40.570
They're menaces to society.
I've done nothing wrong.

13:40.650 --> 13:42.780
I'm not speeding.

13:42.860 --> 13:44.990
-Oh, it's you he's after.
-Me? What did I do?

13:45.070 --> 13:47.070
Your open container.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.910
We'll never survive inside.

13:48.990 --> 13:50.580
-Oh, please.
-Well, you will.

13:50.660 --> 13:54.160
You'll get a very butch girlfriend
who'll protect you like a Fabergé egg.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.670
How on earth is he gonna see my thermos
through these filthy windows?

13:57.750 --> 13:59.880
What, is he, Superman?

13:59.960 --> 14:02.460
Hold tight.
We might be in for the fight of our lives.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.380
<i>- </i><i> Pull over, please.</i>
- Oh, listen to that.

14:04.460 --> 14:07.300
-He's rabid with power.
-Would you pull the damn car over?

14:07.380 --> 14:09.640
-Ditch the booze.
-Yeah, I got it,

14:09.720 --> 14:11.260
I got it, I got it.

14:17.850 --> 14:20.190
All right, keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open.

14:20.270 --> 14:24.030
We don't want to give this deviant
a reason to go Dirty Harry on us.

14:26.570 --> 14:27.820
How are you today, ma'am?

14:27.900 --> 14:30.280
I know my civil rights, that's how I am.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.330
-Good afternoon, Officer.
-Ma'am.

14:32.410 --> 14:37.910
I demand to know why you pulled me over.
And be informed, I'm filming you.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.630
-Here you go. Now you're filming me.
-Oh.

14:42.710 --> 14:45.130
Thank you. I appreciate that.

14:45.210 --> 14:47.090
May I see your license and registration,
please?

14:49.010 --> 14:51.510
Oh, it's water. Because of the drought.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.640
Yeah.

14:53.600 --> 14:57.930
Did you know that your brake light is out,
Ms... Bergstein?

14:58.020 --> 15:00.560
And your license has been expired
for three years.

15:01.980 --> 15:03.520
Does it expire?

15:03.610 --> 15:07.530
Yes, ma'am.
The expiration date hints at that.

15:07.610 --> 15:09.820
Oh. Well, I'll get everything fixed.
Thank you.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.990
Ma'am, you cannot drive.

15:12.070 --> 15:15.200
That's ridiculous.
How am I supposed to get to the DMV?

15:15.290 --> 15:17.200
You'll figure something out, I guess.

15:17.290 --> 15:18.960
What is this? Some kind of shakedown?

15:19.040 --> 15:21.370
-I need water.
-You cannot drive

15:21.460 --> 15:23.130
until you get your
license renewed, ma'am.

15:23.210 --> 15:26.460
Oh, come on, we're like six blocks
from the guy we're stalking.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.510
No, no, no, you shouldn't tell me that.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.890
In three years, it never occurred to you
to look at your license?

15:36.970 --> 15:39.600
I looked once,
but the hologram made me dizzy.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.560
That's it. On the corner.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.650
What am I doing?

15:43.730 --> 15:45.270
I should be driving us home.

15:45.360 --> 15:49.570
Oh, no, you won't.
Or you'll regret it the rest of your life.

15:49.650 --> 15:52.360
Because you'll be spending it with me.
Pull over.

15:58.370 --> 16:01.620
-Damn it, this is exciting.
-Oh, why did I come here?

16:01.710 --> 16:04.630
No, no, it's never too late for love,
my friend.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.300
- Ah.
- What?

16:07.380 --> 16:09.340
-What do you see?
-I see Phil's shoes.

16:09.420 --> 16:12.340
I'm gonna say Timberland.

16:13.220 --> 16:16.430
He looks like an over-pronator.

16:16.510 --> 16:18.600
Do you remember him having bunions?

16:18.680 --> 16:21.520
Yeah, it's all we talked about.
That's how he hooked me.

16:22.350 --> 16:25.100
-Mm.
-What if he's not home?

16:25.190 --> 16:27.150
Or if he's home,
why would he come outside?

16:27.230 --> 16:30.940
Not to worry. As an amateur sleuth,
I always come with three plans:

16:31.030 --> 16:34.410
We throw a rock through his window,
he has to come out to see who did it.

16:34.490 --> 16:36.660
-Well, we're not gonna do that.
-OK, then,

16:36.740 --> 16:40.160
-we ring his doorbell and we run away.
-We actually can't do that.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.540
-If we run slowly?
-That's called walking.

16:42.620 --> 16:44.670
OK. OK.

16:44.750 --> 16:47.710
Plan three,
and this is my <i> pièce de résistance:</i>

16:47.790 --> 16:51.970
We order a pizza. He has to open
the door when the pizza guy knocks.

16:52.050 --> 16:53.760
That's actually not a bad idea.

16:53.840 --> 16:57.010
He comes out,
we duck down, he never sees us.

16:57.100 --> 17:01.430
Oh, my God. I did that with
Jerome Hodges in 11th grade.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.480
Did it work?

17:03.560 --> 17:07.560
Well, he caught me, we ate pizza,
and I had my first orgasm. So, yes.

17:07.650 --> 17:09.980
-Yes, hello, I need to order...
-Oh...

17:10.069 --> 17:11.859
...a very large vegetarian pizza.

17:11.940 --> 17:15.740
I can't do this. Phil is not Jerome
and I'm not in high school.

17:15.819 --> 17:17.319
Oh, I hear you.

17:17.410 --> 17:18.660
Would Phil like onions?

17:33.210 --> 17:34.670
Where are you going?

17:34.760 --> 17:38.390
To my own house, Sol.
Where I live. To take my medication.

17:38.470 --> 17:39.890
What is it? Maybe we have it.

17:39.970 --> 17:43.180
It's a very delicate balance of cannabis,
12-year Scotch and Zoloft.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.310
Dad, you'll be fine, OK? He's sleeping.

17:45.390 --> 17:47.060
- But he'll wake up.
- Then do something.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.650
Y-You both need a distraction right now.

17:49.730 --> 17:51.400
Binge on <i> Antiques Roadshow.</i>

17:51.480 --> 17:53.860
No, no, he has to stay calm.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.280
You should have seen the dance he did

17:55.360 --> 17:57.740
when that nun found out her
stained-glass lamp was Tiffany.

17:57.820 --> 18:00.120
Then watch <i> Walking Dead.</i>
Dad, we have to go.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.700
I'm sorry. I am.

18:01.790 --> 18:06.250
I'm just-- I'm terrified
that everything's going to change.

18:06.330 --> 18:07.500
I don't mean to put it on you.

18:07.580 --> 18:09.290
Wait, what do you mean
everything's about to change?

18:09.380 --> 18:11.250
We've had enough changes.
No more changes.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.590
But when I tell him about Frankie--

18:13.670 --> 18:15.840
No, hold the phone.
You're not telling him anything.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.880
-I have to.
-No, you don't. Trust me.

18:17.970 --> 18:21.220
It's the worst idea you have ever had
in a lifetime of bad ideas.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.760
-He has to tell him sometime.
-Why?

18:22.850 --> 18:24.980
What? Really? No!

18:25.060 --> 18:26.560
Let's all walk through this right now.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.230
You feel horrible
about what happened, right?

18:28.310 --> 18:29.520
Worse than horrible.

18:29.600 --> 18:30.900
And it's never, ever
going to happen again, is it?

18:30.980 --> 18:33.980
-Good God, no!
-Then why tell him?

18:34.070 --> 18:36.530
- What good could come of it?
- Because it's a secret.

18:36.610 --> 18:39.070
OK? And secrets are lies.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.030
Right, so, for the rest of my life

18:42.120 --> 18:44.160
I'm never going to be able
to look him in the eye?

18:44.240 --> 18:48.330
Mm-hmm. Some secrets
are just meant to become cancer.

18:48.410 --> 18:51.920
So just enjoy the rest
of your now shortened life.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.250
One problem with secrets:
they always come out.

18:55.340 --> 18:57.420
-Oh, God.
-What the hell's going on?

19:00.340 --> 19:05.020
What are all these hushed conversations,
for heaven's sake?

19:05.930 --> 19:08.690
Honey, we were being quiet.
We didn't want to wake you.

19:08.770 --> 19:11.400
All day,
everybody's hunched and whispering.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.570
What are you not telling me?

19:13.650 --> 19:15.270
Did the doctor tell you something?

19:16.440 --> 19:20.150
Am I dying, Sol? Is that why
you got me that horrible chair?

19:20.240 --> 19:24.910
No, no. You're fine. You're well. I swear.

19:24.990 --> 19:28.040
All right, then what is it?
What is the elephant in the room?

19:32.250 --> 19:34.750
-Do you really want to know, Dad?
-I have a right to know.

19:36.340 --> 19:37.510
It's fine.

19:37.590 --> 19:38.920
No. Don't.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.560
Coyote has chlamydia.

19:53.980 --> 19:55.480
Just a titch.

19:57.320 --> 19:59.490
I'm over the hump.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.160
They offered him pain pills
but he refused.

20:03.240 --> 20:06.790
-I'm so proud of you, kiddo.
-Aw, thanks, Dad.

20:11.870 --> 20:13.960
Ugh, where is he? Answer the door.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.670
The guy can't knock all day.

20:15.750 --> 20:19.590
Clearly he's not home.
You need to go pay for the pizza.

20:19.670 --> 20:23.010
I don't have any cash.
Can't you pay for it?

20:28.430 --> 20:31.600
Uh, excuse me. I'll take that.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.020
- $15.99.
- Grace?

20:39.230 --> 20:42.320
Phil. Phil.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.910
Who were you expecting?

20:47.990 --> 20:50.750
You. I mean, it is your house.

20:50.830 --> 20:53.170
And I-I-I... I thought I--

20:53.250 --> 20:55.250
that I might run into you here.

20:55.330 --> 20:57.210
Well, you did.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.960
What are you doing here, Grace?

21:02.010 --> 21:06.260
My friend and I
were visiting Mission Viejo because--

21:06.340 --> 21:10.720
Did you know that
Florence Griffith Joyner was born here?

21:13.520 --> 21:17.110
Anyway, we got a little lost,

21:17.190 --> 21:19.070
so I ordered a pizza.

21:21.820 --> 21:23.820
I don't even know what to say.

21:26.990 --> 21:28.660
It's nice seeing you?

21:29.870 --> 21:33.370
Oh, Phil. Phil, I...

21:33.450 --> 21:35.540
I didn't come here for Flo-Jo.

21:35.620 --> 21:38.840
Well, that's good. She's dead.

21:39.710 --> 21:43.550
Oh, this... this is stupid.
I shouldn't have come.

21:44.470 --> 21:45.630
You're right about that.

21:49.180 --> 21:51.810
Well, uh... OK.

21:51.890 --> 21:53.180
I'm gonna go.

21:56.480 --> 21:57.980
Come on, boy.

21:58.770 --> 22:00.440
I'm sorry.

22:02.730 --> 22:04.240
About what?

22:05.360 --> 22:10.240
Not showing up 15 years ago
or showing up 15 years too late?

22:10.320 --> 22:11.950
Phil, I did show up.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.290
I was there.

22:15.370 --> 22:18.080
I went... right up to the door.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.710
I was at the door.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.710
I just-- I couldn't do it.

22:24.630 --> 22:26.720
Couldn't do what? Knock?

22:26.800 --> 22:29.930
I wanted to, I did.

22:30.010 --> 22:34.560
But you didn't. You left me sitting there.

22:36.140 --> 22:38.310
I had no idea what happened to you.

22:40.690 --> 22:43.650
I wanted to call you,

22:43.730 --> 22:46.150
but I was afraid if I...

22:46.240 --> 22:48.780
if I heard your voice...

22:50.200 --> 22:52.780
What did you think
was gonna happen here today?

22:54.080 --> 22:56.370
I don't know.

22:57.660 --> 22:59.500
Go home, Grace.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.100
Are you OK?

23:14.100 --> 23:15.810
I'm fine.

23:20.060 --> 23:21.350
I can drive.

23:21.440 --> 23:23.440
You don't have a license.

23:34.280 --> 23:38.790
I can read to you from <i> New Law Journal.</i>

23:38.870 --> 23:42.250
There's a searing article
about corroborative witnesses.

23:42.330 --> 23:45.500
Honey, I want you
to tell me what is wrong.

23:46.340 --> 23:49.050
And it's not about Coyote's chlamydia.

23:49.130 --> 23:52.260
You've been out of your mind
since we got home.

23:52.340 --> 23:55.890
-No, I'm just tired.
-I've seen you tired. This is not that.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.310
I-I'm OK.

23:58.390 --> 24:03.730
Sol, you realize I'm fine, right?
The hard part is over and I made it.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.650
Something else is going on.

24:06.730 --> 24:09.900
Just tell me what it is, please.

24:14.070 --> 24:16.780
I'm just so afraid of losing you.

24:19.950 --> 24:21.500
What are you doing? You--

24:39.520 --> 24:41.890
We never got a chance to do this part.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.860
Your turn.

25:07.670 --> 25:09.840
I'm not going anywhere.

25:20.850 --> 25:23.560
I knew my license had lapsed. I...

25:23.640 --> 25:26.560
I was afraid I couldn't pass the test.

25:26.650 --> 25:30.110
Damn these boots.

25:30.190 --> 25:32.150
My feet are killing me.

25:35.320 --> 25:37.660
I'm sorry, Grace.

25:37.740 --> 25:41.660
-I-I thought--
-What? What did you think?

25:41.740 --> 25:45.120
I'd hoped that when you saw him,

25:45.210 --> 25:46.500
you would get your wish.

25:46.580 --> 25:48.500
I don't need your hope.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.500
Hope is overrated.

25:52.710 --> 25:53.840
I meant well.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.550
-I don't want to talk, Frankie.
-But I--

25:56.630 --> 25:58.930
I just need quiet.

25:59.010 --> 26:02.720
I'm just saying you--
you ran a red light.
