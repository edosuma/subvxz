WEBVTT

00:04.030 --> 00:07.057
Hey, there's my... angry girl.

00:07.125 --> 00:09.191
My relaxing morning off
took a disastrous turn.

00:09.241 --> 00:11.470
Oh, don't tell me you went
to the early bird scrapbooking thing.

00:11.472 --> 00:13.405
Alex, just admit it...
you hate scrapbooking,

00:13.407 --> 00:15.006
you hate crafts, you hate crafting.

00:15.008 --> 00:16.207
Do you know what this is?

00:16.209 --> 00:17.481
Uh, no.

00:17.531 --> 00:19.300
This is a memory book for Luke,

00:19.350 --> 00:20.858
and I'm supposed to fill
it with family photos.

00:20.908 --> 00:21.784
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:21.834 --> 00:22.847
So, do you notice anything?

00:23.202 --> 00:25.389
That somebody likes pink glitter.

00:25.489 --> 00:27.651
The photos are of just us and him.

00:27.701 --> 00:29.420
What are we supposed to tell him
about the rest of his family?

00:29.422 --> 00:31.923
Well, you could tell him the truth.
The truth always works.

00:31.925 --> 00:32.958
Okay, so I will tell him

00:32.960 --> 00:34.593
that his grandfather committed suicide,

00:34.595 --> 00:37.107
his uncle plunged to his death,
possibly high on drugs.

00:37.157 --> 00:39.065
Okay, there's your mother?

00:39.155 --> 00:40.809
No. She doesn't count.

00:40.859 --> 00:42.700
Well, she's alive, and by virtue of the fact

00:42.702 --> 00:44.697
that nobody else seems to be,
then she definitely counts.

00:44.772 --> 00:46.838
She's been a ghost my whole life.

00:47.892 --> 00:50.000
- What's wrong?
- Uh...

00:50.897 --> 00:51.837
Speaking of.

00:51.887 --> 00:53.442
One of your friends?

00:53.670 --> 00:56.179
Alex, you know I don't believe in friends.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.515
[chuckles]

00:59.827 --> 01:02.051
Hey, I recognize you.

01:02.254 --> 01:03.185
Aren't you that guy

01:03.187 --> 01:05.021
that was tangled in my sheets this morning?

01:05.022 --> 01:06.288
I was.

01:06.290 --> 01:08.725
I'm also the guy who said
he'd make you breakfast. Here.

01:08.727 --> 01:10.893
I went hard on the wheatgrass

01:10.895 --> 01:13.462
because I know that you can take it.

01:13.464 --> 01:16.499
Wow. You came all this way to bring me this.

01:16.927 --> 01:20.503
No, I, uh, came all this
way to bring you this.

01:20.505 --> 01:21.904
Yeah, no.

01:22.276 --> 01:25.907
I'm the chief of surgery.
I have a reputation to uphold.

01:25.909 --> 01:27.776
Oh, what, are you mad?

01:27.973 --> 01:30.045
No, I love when my girlfriend won't kiss me.

01:30.047 --> 01:31.379
Reminds me of high school.

01:31.381 --> 01:33.982
Yeah, well, I worked really
hard to get here, right?

01:33.984 --> 01:35.117
I know.

01:35.119 --> 01:39.354
That is why I also brought you this.

01:39.976 --> 01:41.256
What did you do?

01:46.040 --> 01:48.867
Uh, this is way too much.

01:49.346 --> 01:50.836
Are you serious?

01:50.968 --> 01:52.700
I've never been more serious in my life.

01:53.813 --> 01:55.532
I don't know what to say.

01:55.635 --> 01:58.187
Say that you'll let me
take you for lunch today.

02:00.992 --> 02:02.593
Oh, your reputation.

02:02.643 --> 02:03.829
Oh, screw it.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.099
Excuse me.

02:07.149 --> 02:08.989
- Calling in your coffee orders now, Dr. Lin?
- Thank you.

02:09.038 --> 02:11.919
It's the only way I'm gonna
get through this double shift.

02:12.306 --> 02:14.017
I'm shadowing Rocca today.

02:14.160 --> 02:15.215
Wow. Busy bee.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.758
I guess we'll have to chat
later when you're not so buzzy.

02:18.481 --> 02:19.694
Okay. Huzzah fellowship.

02:19.696 --> 02:21.062
Huzzah fellowship.

02:21.064 --> 02:23.030
That was the lamest huzzah I've ever heard,

02:23.032 --> 02:25.666
which is a feat because huzzah
is pretty lame to begin with.

02:25.668 --> 02:27.234
I know, I'm just... I don't know.

02:27.236 --> 02:28.502
What, a working mother

02:28.504 --> 02:30.437
who's terrified of losing
her professional edge?

02:30.713 --> 02:32.457
Hey, have you been reading my diary again?

02:32.507 --> 02:34.708
Hmm. You know,
being a mother doing this job,

02:34.710 --> 02:36.609
god, it's one hell of a balancing act.

02:36.611 --> 02:38.011
It's a freaking tightrope.

02:38.013 --> 02:39.245
Well, I hate to tell you,

02:39.247 --> 02:40.947
but that feeling doesn't go away,

02:40.949 --> 02:42.548
you know, that life/work thing.

02:42.550 --> 02:44.584
And that you're not doing well at either.

02:44.586 --> 02:46.086
[cellphones vibrate]

02:46.088 --> 02:47.620
Ooh, speaking of work.

02:47.622 --> 02:49.081
What is it? Oh, E.R.?

02:49.131 --> 02:49.924
Mm-hmm.

02:50.582 --> 02:51.829
Did you hear the news?

02:52.276 --> 02:53.844
They think they can wake me up from my coma.

02:53.894 --> 02:56.214
Yeah, your body's healed up.
Time to get you back on your feet.

02:56.432 --> 02:57.750
You're gonna be there, right?

02:57.847 --> 02:59.984
Well, I'll try, but I'm on call, so...

03:00.480 --> 03:02.801
No, I mean, when I go back in my body,

03:02.803 --> 03:05.137
you still gonna be in my corner?

03:05.139 --> 03:06.338
Yeah, of course.

03:06.645 --> 03:09.240
I don't think I would've been
able to get through this without you.

03:09.428 --> 03:10.393
Well, I think you would've found a way.

03:10.443 --> 03:11.812
You seem pretty resilient.

03:12.330 --> 03:14.210
Yeah, well, growing up
on a farm in the prairies

03:14.260 --> 03:15.271
will do that to a kid.

03:15.321 --> 03:17.358
Yeah, how old were you when
you went into the system?

03:17.516 --> 03:19.650
After my dad died, so 10.

03:20.199 --> 03:22.225
Yeah. I was 7.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.188
Medical school seemed like
a breeze in comparison.

03:25.105 --> 03:26.556
Yeah, it's funny now,

03:26.606 --> 03:27.889
but learning how to fend for myself

03:27.939 --> 03:29.823
actually made me pretty good at prison.

03:29.873 --> 03:31.695
Still looking for someone to call for you.

03:31.697 --> 03:33.210
Oh, there's no one.

03:33.975 --> 03:35.626
Seriously, Charlie, there hasn't been anyone

03:35.676 --> 03:37.516
that's cared enough to
help in a really long time,

03:37.566 --> 03:39.521
so thanks.

03:45.825 --> 03:47.715
Elizabeth Grant, social worker.

03:47.765 --> 03:49.484
Client of hers threw
sulfuric acid on her face.

03:49.534 --> 03:50.385
Happened 30 minutes ago.

03:50.435 --> 03:51.882
She could have burns to the oropharynx.

03:51.884 --> 03:54.684
We need to intubate.
Get me 50 mgs of ketamine.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.317
- I need another I.V. started now.
- Here we go.

03:56.367 --> 03:57.181
Heads up!

03:57.231 --> 03:58.388
Zach: Okay, she's got an open fracture here.

03:58.390 --> 04:01.124
- She's gonna bleed out if this artery blows.
- Somebody page Dr. Harris.

04:01.402 --> 04:04.264
One, two, three. [grunts]

04:04.718 --> 04:06.308
Dana: Back is clear.

04:06.358 --> 04:07.834
Burns to the face, chest, and arms.

04:07.884 --> 04:09.871
Please, it hurts so much.

04:09.921 --> 04:12.026
Get me a Morgan Lens. I need irrigation.

04:12.076 --> 04:12.968
B.P.'s 70.

04:12.970 --> 04:14.170
- Ketamine.
Dana: - Let's get her out of these clothes

04:14.172 --> 04:15.678
so I can properly assess the burns.

04:15.728 --> 04:17.307
Let's get her to the O.R.,
Take care of that arm.

04:17.309 --> 04:18.140
Where's Charlie?

04:18.142 --> 04:19.545
- Right here.
- Oh.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.014
Okay, let's move it.

04:22.064 --> 04:23.313
Dr. Reid, I paged you.

04:23.468 --> 04:24.980
Your friend is in the waiting room.

04:24.982 --> 04:26.981
He's refusing to be seen by anyone but you.

04:26.983 --> 04:29.284
I don't believe this.

04:34.457 --> 04:37.292
What the hell do you want?

04:38.213 --> 04:39.795
Hey, Reid. Surprised to see me?

04:39.797 --> 04:42.364
Yeah, considering I told you
I never wanted to again.

04:42.662 --> 04:44.399
Come on, Alex. We were just kids.

04:44.401 --> 04:45.534
What do you want?

04:45.536 --> 04:47.972
You know what?
I-I don't want to hear it.

04:48.022 --> 04:49.030
- I don't care.
- Alex, wait.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.370
What?

04:51.474 --> 04:52.941
Kyle? Kyle.

04:52.943 --> 04:54.608
Kyle? Kyle!

04:55.855 --> 04:57.399
Some help in here, please!

04:57.517 --> 04:59.680
Kyle, it's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

04:59.815 --> 05:01.098
You're gonna be okay.

05:01.148 --> 05:03.417
Some help now!

05:05.000 --> 05:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:13.226 --> 05:14.388
Full thickness burns to the face.

05:14.390 --> 05:16.689
Full thickness circumferential
burns to the wrist.

05:16.739 --> 05:18.408
I'm debriding the wound now.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.452
How are we doing on that arm, Dr. Harris?

05:20.516 --> 05:22.466
- Got healthy tissue here.
- Uh-huh.

05:22.516 --> 05:24.115
With fascia muscle over the exposed bone,

05:24.165 --> 05:25.706
but I still can't close the wound.

05:25.756 --> 05:27.238
Tell me you have a plan.

05:27.288 --> 05:28.981
Yeah, I've placed a VAC
dressing to help keep it clean

05:29.031 --> 05:29.954
while you do your thing,

05:30.004 --> 05:31.744
and I'll take care of the break after.

05:32.084 --> 05:33.965
That's why you're my favorite ortho.

05:34.015 --> 05:36.305
You know how to share the dance floor.

05:40.489 --> 05:42.265
You must be Dr. Williams.

05:42.315 --> 05:45.458
- I-I'm sorry.
- I-I got my rotation mixed up.

05:49.123 --> 05:50.648
How can I help?

05:50.698 --> 05:51.656
Take the cheese grater.

05:51.706 --> 05:54.246
Help me remove the necrotic tissue.

05:57.033 --> 05:59.992
Can you put some gauze
over her face, please?

06:01.183 --> 06:03.334
I need everybody's focus here.

06:13.592 --> 06:15.093
- You paged?
- I did.

06:15.143 --> 06:17.479
I need you to take a patient. Kyle Sawyer.

06:17.529 --> 06:20.314
He was just admitted with
severe abdominal pain.

06:21.568 --> 06:22.624
What?

06:22.938 --> 06:24.808
I'm just surprised you're dodging patients.

06:24.858 --> 06:27.854
Well, I'm not dodging patients.
My hands are full today.

06:28.053 --> 06:30.045
He spat blood, so you'll
need to do an endoscopy.

06:30.095 --> 06:31.327
Wait, you've not done a work-up on him?

06:31.377 --> 06:33.684
That's what you're here for.
He's in cubicle three.

06:33.914 --> 06:35.482
I owe you one.

06:39.263 --> 06:42.123
Kyle, have you ever had bleeding
from your stomach before?

06:42.211 --> 06:44.537
I mean, the pain's been on and
off for a couple weeks now,

06:44.587 --> 06:47.166
but that's the first time
I've ever puked blood.

06:47.364 --> 06:48.387
What do I win?

06:48.437 --> 06:49.493
You win...

06:49.580 --> 06:50.756
a camera.

06:50.807 --> 06:51.816
Sweet.

06:51.866 --> 06:53.632
Unfortunately,
it'll be going down your throat

06:53.682 --> 06:55.584
to locate the source of this bleed.

06:58.462 --> 06:59.245
Where's Alex?

06:59.295 --> 07:01.392
I, uh, thought
she was gonna be doing this.

07:01.442 --> 07:03.501
Dr. Reid has a busy O.R. day.

07:03.808 --> 07:05.016
You two know each other?

07:05.066 --> 07:06.606
She's like my sister.

07:06.780 --> 07:08.685
Don't ever let her catch
you cheating at cards.

07:08.735 --> 07:10.115
That girl can throw a punch.

07:10.306 --> 07:11.229
I'll bear that in mind

07:11.279 --> 07:12.948
next time we're in a gangster film together.

07:13.139 --> 07:14.763
Jackson: Anita Alamo, 20.

07:16.830 --> 07:19.550
Woke up this morning with
heaviness in both of her legs.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.048
I tried to go to work,

07:21.098 --> 07:22.944
but they just kept getting heavier.

07:22.994 --> 07:24.645
This ever happen to you before?

07:26.510 --> 07:29.150
Reflexes are good. You feel this?

07:29.200 --> 07:30.925
Yeah, but barely.

07:31.419 --> 07:32.923
You can fix this, right?

07:32.973 --> 07:34.622
We're gonna try our best.

07:34.925 --> 07:37.326
'Cause I had a friend in here...

07:37.376 --> 07:38.564
Samantha Smitts.

07:38.615 --> 07:39.778
Remember her?

07:39.828 --> 07:41.559
Not ringing a bell.

07:41.626 --> 07:42.799
But that suit sure is.

07:42.849 --> 07:45.211
You're the sidewalk-singing chicken, right?

07:45.295 --> 07:48.194
♪ I like wings and spicy things ♪

07:50.713 --> 07:51.531
Okay.

07:51.581 --> 07:52.928
Let's, uh, start on her bloodwork,

07:52.978 --> 07:54.113
check her G.A.D. antibody levels.

07:54.163 --> 07:55.047
Could be S.P.S.

07:55.097 --> 07:56.271
What's that?

07:56.400 --> 07:58.442
Stiff Person Syndrome.

07:58.526 --> 08:00.086
Yes, that is the real name.

08:00.136 --> 08:01.598
It's just a development that happens

08:01.648 --> 08:02.859
in the lower extremities.

08:02.909 --> 08:04.047
We just have to rule it out.

08:04.097 --> 08:07.006
Okay, 'cause I have to
get to a party tonight.

08:07.056 --> 08:09.034
I'm the designated driver.

08:09.084 --> 08:11.443
You're in the hospital.
I'm sure they'll understand.

08:11.743 --> 08:13.527
Besides, there will be other parties.

08:13.670 --> 08:15.816
Well, it's more of an anniversary.

08:16.342 --> 08:18.177
Emergency room on your anniversary.

08:18.227 --> 08:19.191
Welcome to my life.

08:19.241 --> 08:21.130
Okay, let's get started on those tests.

08:21.336 --> 08:22.471
Hey.

08:22.858 --> 08:26.199
Any chance of an extra gown?

08:26.249 --> 08:28.705
You know, help a chicken out?

08:29.249 --> 08:30.175
You bet.

08:31.263 --> 08:34.044
[monitor beeping]

08:39.267 --> 08:41.360
Stop thinking like a civilian.

08:41.409 --> 08:43.496
You're a doctor.
Time to get used to that.

08:43.546 --> 08:45.585
I'm never getting used to this.

08:45.762 --> 08:48.420
The sooner you stop denying what
human beings are capable of,

08:48.470 --> 08:50.512
the better off you'll be.

08:50.693 --> 08:52.890
That's kind of harsh, Dr. Kinney.

08:52.940 --> 08:56.233
It's kind of the reality, honey.
Apply the antimicrobial.

08:57.094 --> 08:59.177
[monitor beeping rapidly]

08:59.227 --> 09:00.647
Her heart rate's rising.

09:00.697 --> 09:02.837
Dr. Kinney, there's blood
in the VAC dressing.

09:03.286 --> 09:06.133
I'm not getting a radial
or ulnar pulse here.

09:08.081 --> 09:11.264
We need to restore circulation
or she's gonna lose this hand.

09:11.314 --> 09:13.149
Prep the microscope.

09:16.604 --> 09:19.406
Uh, Dr. Harris?

09:19.500 --> 09:20.512
Yep.

09:20.562 --> 09:22.374
You're Elizabeth Grant's physician?

09:22.500 --> 09:25.746
Um, actually, Dr. Kinney is
the lead surgeon on the case.

09:25.796 --> 09:27.814
Do you know where I can find her?

09:28.664 --> 09:29.611
She's in the O.R.,

09:29.661 --> 09:32.241
But, um, I can have her come
see you when she's done.

09:32.291 --> 09:34.734
Thanks. I know Elizabeth.
We work together a lot.

09:34.849 --> 09:37.907
Yeah. You guys catch
the guy who did this to her?

09:37.957 --> 09:39.619
Colleague I.D.'d someone.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.546
Elizabeth: This is all my fault.

09:45.390 --> 09:47.331
You can see me.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.982
How can you see me?

09:50.104 --> 09:52.990
Probably best we do this somewhere else.

09:54.767 --> 09:56.708
Daven: You talking to me, doc?

09:57.039 --> 09:59.226
No, no.
I will send Dr. Kinney your way,

09:59.276 --> 10:00.714
and, um, I'll let you know

10:00.764 --> 10:02.219
when Elizabeth's well enough for visitors.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.527
Thanks.

10:10.283 --> 10:12.900
Dr. Miller, you got to see this.

10:14.319 --> 10:17.098
[gasping]

10:17.148 --> 10:20.099
My legs... I can't feel them anymore.

10:20.486 --> 10:21.415
Can you feel this?

10:21.465 --> 10:22.225
No.

10:22.309 --> 10:24.144
- How about this?
- No. Nothing.

10:24.194 --> 10:26.009
Page Dr. Hamza now.

10:26.389 --> 10:29.438
What's wrong with me? Am I paralyzed?

10:37.499 --> 10:38.211
Thank you.

10:38.261 --> 10:39.474
Ugh.

10:43.112 --> 10:44.846
Patient with the acid burn, how is she?

10:44.848 --> 10:46.048
Elizabeth. Touch and go.

10:46.050 --> 10:47.916
We're just setting up for microsurgery now.

10:48.676 --> 10:50.085
I hear you dumped a patient this morning.

10:50.087 --> 10:51.186
What's up with that?

10:51.188 --> 10:53.154
Wow. Walls have ears.

10:53.156 --> 10:55.924
He only presented with gastritis.

10:55.926 --> 10:57.024
Oh.

10:58.475 --> 11:00.327
It's adenocarcinoma.

11:01.158 --> 11:02.592
He'll need a distal pancreatectomy

11:02.642 --> 11:03.898
at the very least.

11:05.308 --> 11:07.802
Ah, well, in the wrong hands,
that could be a death sentence.

11:07.852 --> 11:09.380
It's a good thing
that Patrick's a great surgeon.

11:09.430 --> 11:11.824
Yeah, but it's a rare procedure
and one you've done before.

11:11.874 --> 11:12.773
Once.

11:12.831 --> 11:14.095
So, you should be in there.

11:14.145 --> 11:15.241
We have a history.

11:15.291 --> 11:16.161
He used to sleep on my couch

11:16.211 --> 11:17.483
whenever he got kicked out of his house.

11:17.533 --> 11:19.080
My mother felt sorry for him.

11:19.170 --> 11:20.768
So, I still don't see the problem.

11:20.818 --> 11:22.817
He got my brother hooked on drugs.

11:23.567 --> 11:25.250
Never mix the professional
with the personal.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.988
Didn't you teach me that? No. I hate him.

11:31.092 --> 11:34.228
[ <i>man speaks indistinctly over P.A.</i> ]

11:34.540 --> 11:36.010
Elizabeth?

11:41.014 --> 11:41.868
Hey, Charlie.

11:42.405 --> 11:43.798
Hey, Tom.

11:44.561 --> 11:46.164
Looking for a girl. Um,

11:46.304 --> 11:48.189
beautiful, dark hair.

11:48.412 --> 11:49.996
Don't you already have one of those?

11:50.046 --> 11:50.773
No, not Alex.

11:50.823 --> 11:53.590
Um... spirit. Named Elizabeth.

11:53.740 --> 11:55.144
Short hair, blue eyes?

11:55.444 --> 11:56.122
Yes.

11:56.172 --> 11:57.454
Mm-hmm.

11:57.569 --> 11:59.443
Stopped me dead in my tracks when I saw her.

11:59.493 --> 12:02.486
She looks just like Rina Potts,
a friend from back home.

12:02.590 --> 12:03.363
From High River?

12:03.413 --> 12:04.223
Yeah.

12:04.618 --> 12:05.736
Um, where'd you see her?

12:05.786 --> 12:07.396
In the basement.

12:07.904 --> 12:10.068
Need me to come with?

12:11.751 --> 12:14.936
Her name's Mya and
she's asked to speak with you.

12:15.069 --> 12:17.306
Kyle has a wife. [chuckles]

12:17.536 --> 12:20.498
Dr. Reid, this is Mya, Kyle's wife.

12:20.606 --> 12:22.424
- Hello.
- Hi.

12:23.491 --> 12:25.148
Kyle always said you were a firecracker,

12:25.198 --> 12:28.202
but for some reason,
I thought you'd be shorter.

12:29.780 --> 12:31.784
He's gonna make it, right?

12:34.446 --> 12:37.194
Dr. Curtis is an excellent surgeon.

12:37.244 --> 12:39.694
But what do you think?

12:40.656 --> 12:43.241
It's a long shot, isn't it?

12:44.429 --> 12:47.405
So, what do I tell Lucas? He's only 4.

12:48.336 --> 12:50.259
You named your son Lucas?

12:50.792 --> 12:53.472
Yeah, Kyle loved your brother so much.

12:53.559 --> 12:55.669
I don't think your brother
ever really forgave himself

12:55.719 --> 12:58.274
for getting Kyle into that lifestyle.

12:59.761 --> 13:01.854
Oh, did-did Kyle tell you that?

13:01.904 --> 13:06.152
No, your brother did when
he became Kyle's sponsor.

13:06.602 --> 13:09.504
Excuse me, Mya, um,
we do have to start prepping.

13:09.554 --> 13:10.940
Thank you.

13:21.857 --> 13:23.962
Will you come see us after?

13:24.516 --> 13:26.829
I will if I can, yeah.

13:28.781 --> 13:33.039
I loved him, Alex. We all did.

13:39.914 --> 13:41.617
You don't feel your legs at all?

13:41.771 --> 13:43.786
I can barely tell they're there.

13:44.642 --> 13:46.385
How about this?

13:46.914 --> 13:48.183
Ow!

13:48.932 --> 13:50.457
That's very interesting.

13:50.507 --> 13:53.403
So, am I paralyzed or what?

13:54.134 --> 13:55.611
It's conversion disorder.

13:55.661 --> 13:57.908
Her paralysis is emotionally rooted.

13:58.001 --> 13:59.513
So, she's faking it?

13:59.563 --> 14:02.033
Her symptoms, in her mind, are real.

14:02.083 --> 14:03.824
We just need to treat them accordingly.

14:03.874 --> 14:05.636
So, she thinks she's paralyzed?

14:05.686 --> 14:07.988
We know she's not,
but we pretend that she is

14:08.038 --> 14:09.730
so that she can stop being paralyzed?

14:09.780 --> 14:10.855
Precisely.

14:10.905 --> 14:13.081
Why don't we just ask her what...

14:15.868 --> 14:17.028
Why don't we just ask
her what her problem is

14:17.078 --> 14:18.624
and tell her to get over it?

14:18.795 --> 14:20.333
Because we risk making it worse.

14:20.383 --> 14:22.633
I'd rather approach this
from a more obtuse angle.

14:22.683 --> 14:25.250
Well, how's this for obtuse?
Jackson, page the psych ward.

14:25.300 --> 14:26.759
But I think it's best if we keep her here,

14:26.809 --> 14:28.262
if you can spare the bed.

14:28.715 --> 14:30.930
I know beds are at a premium, but trust me.

14:30.980 --> 14:32.090
Administer a vitamin drip,

14:32.140 --> 14:33.383
tell her you're running some tests.

14:33.433 --> 14:35.683
Shahir, we do not have
time for this. We're busy.

14:35.733 --> 14:36.599
Well, she needs to believe

14:36.649 --> 14:38.605
that she's being treated
for a physical issue.

14:38.893 --> 14:39.747
Only then can we identify

14:39.797 --> 14:42.109
what's truly triggering all
of this in the first place.

14:45.469 --> 14:48.450
Man, the stitch is in the way.
I can't grasp the needle.

14:48.500 --> 14:52.175
Take a breath, breathe.
Now move into proper position.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.971
Damn it. It slipped again.

14:54.748 --> 14:58.043
Keep your mind on the artery.
Stop thinking about the patient.

14:58.093 --> 15:00.313
One of us needs to.

15:01.013 --> 15:02.264
Here.

15:02.721 --> 15:04.362
I'll do that.

15:05.916 --> 15:07.515
Okay.

15:07.885 --> 15:10.969
We'll confirm blood flow
and then we'll close.

15:12.561 --> 15:14.100
You with me, Dr. Williams?

15:14.150 --> 15:15.724
Or perhaps there's something else

15:15.774 --> 15:18.088
you'd like to blurt out first.

15:35.587 --> 15:38.054
Will my face ever look the same?

15:41.619 --> 15:43.302
I don't know.

15:46.699 --> 15:47.726
What I can tell you

15:47.776 --> 15:50.452
is that you're in
a medically induced coma.

15:51.637 --> 15:54.062
Is it because of what he did to me?

15:55.658 --> 15:56.714
Yeah.

16:01.613 --> 16:03.394
Listen, before you said that

16:03.537 --> 16:06.037
you thought that this was your fault.
You don't...

16:06.087 --> 16:07.502
believe that.

16:08.352 --> 16:09.983
Jake was, um...

16:10.283 --> 16:12.739
Jake was a client of mine, and I...

16:14.238 --> 16:15.332
I knew his history.

16:15.959 --> 16:17.109
He was really...

16:18.308 --> 16:22.725
he was really violent and
really unpredictable.

16:22.775 --> 16:24.332
I don't know why...

16:24.677 --> 16:26.028
I don't know why
I thought I could save him.

16:26.078 --> 16:28.280
I don't even know why I wanted to.

16:29.591 --> 16:31.133
You were trying to do your job.

16:31.183 --> 16:32.419
Well, my job is to look for signs,

16:32.469 --> 16:35.542
and I literally missed every single one.

16:39.511 --> 16:41.403
How bad is it, doctor?

16:48.052 --> 16:50.045
That's what I thought.

16:51.355 --> 16:52.168
Show me.

16:53.247 --> 16:54.237
I really don't think that's a good...

16:54.239 --> 16:57.627
With all due respect,
this is my face and I need to see it.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.377
Show me.

17:32.414 --> 17:35.465
- I knew that...
- I knew it was gonna be bad.

17:35.515 --> 17:36.608
I just didn't...

17:36.658 --> 17:38.638
I didn't think
it was gonna be <i>that</i> bad.

17:39.327 --> 17:40.740
Dr. Kinney's the best in the city,

17:40.742 --> 17:41.873
if not the whole country.

17:41.923 --> 17:43.383
So, she's gonna be able to

17:43.470 --> 17:45.961
fix me and I'm gonna look like I used to?

17:47.781 --> 17:49.282
It's gonna take some time.

17:52.852 --> 17:55.488
I don't...
I don't want to look like that.

17:56.286 --> 17:58.126
Listen, we're gonna do
everything in our power

17:58.176 --> 17:59.825
to make you whole again.

17:59.875 --> 18:04.921
How am I supposed to help
people if I look like a monster?

18:07.444 --> 18:09.669
I can't believe he did this to me.

18:12.005 --> 18:13.939
You were trying to help him.

18:17.103 --> 18:18.918
I loved him.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.988
It's never happened before.

18:25.330 --> 18:27.675
Never with a client, but with Jake,

18:29.194 --> 18:31.299
I fell so in love with him.

18:33.860 --> 18:35.773
I'm so ashamed.

18:38.007 --> 18:39.801
Listen, none of that matters.

18:40.164 --> 18:43.112
You need to focus
on your own recovery right now.

18:43.509 --> 18:46.136
Doctor, I just need to be alone.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.511
All right, so, uh,

18:54.513 --> 18:56.413
I want you to run those cultures.

18:56.415 --> 18:57.448
Keep me notified.

18:57.450 --> 18:58.582
Are you Dr. Kinney?

18:58.584 --> 19:00.918
I'm wondering
how Elizabeth Grant is doing.

19:00.920 --> 19:01.853
Uh, she's stable.

19:01.855 --> 19:03.054
Needs to stay intubated

19:03.056 --> 19:05.156
until I can operate on her facial burns.

19:05.158 --> 19:07.866
Okay. Uh, I'm the first to
know if anything changes, yeah?

19:07.916 --> 19:09.260
Mm-hmm. You two work together?

19:09.312 --> 19:11.918
Yeah, uh, Elizabeth was at Children's Aid

19:11.968 --> 19:13.786
- when I worked regent park.
- Mm-hmm.

19:13.899 --> 19:15.498
She helped a lot of kids.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.367
I want to be here when she wakes up,
get her statement.

19:17.369 --> 19:19.369
You're gonna get the bastard
who did this, right?

19:19.371 --> 19:20.370
Make him pay?

19:20.372 --> 19:22.138
Oh, for the love of...

19:22.140 --> 19:23.939
Excuse me. Come on.

19:23.941 --> 19:24.741
What?

19:24.743 --> 19:26.776
Shrug your shoulders.

19:26.975 --> 19:28.236
- Did you shrug?
- Yes.

19:28.286 --> 19:29.627
Yeah. Go like this.

19:30.386 --> 19:31.777
Okay, now hit me.

19:31.949 --> 19:32.784
What?

19:32.834 --> 19:33.481
Go ahead.

19:33.531 --> 19:34.554
You get one, so make it good.

19:34.604 --> 19:36.470
And not directly in the face. Go.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.136
Dr. Kinney, I...

19:38.843 --> 19:41.357
What? Why not? You're mad, aren't you?

19:41.359 --> 19:42.292
Yeah.

19:42.861 --> 19:45.194
But aside from the legal issues

19:45.196 --> 19:49.245
and you being surgical royalty,
I'm new here.

19:49.346 --> 19:51.356
So, you think
it might be unprofessional

19:51.433 --> 19:53.886
to lose control of your emotions like that?

19:54.712 --> 19:57.172
Right. Message received.

19:57.241 --> 19:58.761
I hate to tell you,

19:59.793 --> 20:01.744
but the way you are feeling,

20:01.862 --> 20:03.389
that's about you.

20:03.490 --> 20:05.831
That isn't about that woman in there.

20:06.218 --> 20:10.176
There will always be a patient
who will break your heart,

20:10.226 --> 20:13.288
who will remind you of
a friend or a sweetheart.

20:13.338 --> 20:18.707
The jerk your sister dated
when you knew she shouldn't.

20:19.013 --> 20:21.396
Sometimes their wounds open ours.

20:22.115 --> 20:25.104
And the only way to deal with it...
the only way...

20:25.244 --> 20:28.519
is to focus on the medicine.

20:29.714 --> 20:31.139
So, what are you gonna do?

20:32.352 --> 20:35.043
Run some cultures, keep you updated.

20:48.475 --> 20:49.728
Hey. What's going on?

20:49.778 --> 20:51.429
Dr. Curtis
is supposed to be in there.

20:51.479 --> 20:54.326
He was pulled. There was code trauma.
Motorcyclist versus truck.

20:54.517 --> 20:56.176
We need your help in there.

20:56.226 --> 20:57.709
Okay.

20:59.016 --> 20:59.688
[sighs]

20:59.738 --> 21:01.685
Just give me a minute.

21:02.347 --> 21:03.500
Scrubbing in.

21:04.225 --> 21:05.556
The money
has already been allocated.

21:05.606 --> 21:07.229
End of story.

21:08.869 --> 21:11.444
Yeah, well, me, too.

21:14.583 --> 21:16.416
Why do I always have to be the bad guy?

21:16.531 --> 21:18.228
Even Lex Luthor had a day off.

21:18.303 --> 21:22.505
Yeah, but he still spent it
plotting world domination, so...

21:28.264 --> 21:29.879
You don't like it.

21:29.929 --> 21:31.664
Like what?

21:33.066 --> 21:34.552
Of course I like it.

21:34.602 --> 21:35.967
I love it.

21:36.017 --> 21:37.362
I love it.

21:37.438 --> 21:38.852
Then why aren't you wearing it?

21:39.021 --> 21:41.206
Because I don't want to lose it.

21:41.816 --> 21:45.242
I mean, we have to scrub in,
and it just... you know.

21:49.648 --> 21:51.263
Are you okay?

21:57.038 --> 21:58.535
[chuckles]

21:58.727 --> 22:00.186
[laughs]

22:00.236 --> 22:01.527
I'm just playing.

22:02.643 --> 22:04.529
Wow, you think I'm that neurotic.

22:05.019 --> 22:06.397
That is good to know.

22:06.505 --> 22:08.669
Do you want to drive or shall I?

22:08.719 --> 22:10.919
Uh, yeah, no, I, uh...

22:11.127 --> 22:13.047
I can't. I just realized.

22:13.408 --> 22:15.156
Have an emergency meeting at work.

22:15.345 --> 22:16.647
Oh. Okay.

22:16.697 --> 22:18.798
Uh, what kind of

22:18.994 --> 22:21.628
emergency meeting happens
at a P.R. consulting firm?

22:21.678 --> 22:23.714
[chuckles] S&P 500.

22:23.781 --> 22:24.914
Massive stock drop.

22:24.964 --> 22:27.184
Angry investors everywhere.

22:28.798 --> 22:31.397
Yeah, okay, sure.

22:39.469 --> 22:40.430
Yeah?

22:41.182 --> 22:43.032
Nothing. Nothing.

22:43.260 --> 22:44.701
Have a great day.

22:56.894 --> 22:57.984
Ta-da.

22:58.180 --> 22:59.615
Am I going in for tests now?

22:59.665 --> 23:01.704
Nope. Even better.

23:02.084 --> 23:04.895
Okay, put your arm around my shoulder.

23:04.990 --> 23:06.526
On the count of three,
we are gonna transfer.

23:06.576 --> 23:09.745
One, two, three. There we go.

23:09.795 --> 23:11.466
We thought you might've
been getting a little bored

23:11.516 --> 23:13.213
sitting in that bed all day.

23:13.398 --> 23:15.210
You're giving away my bed?

23:15.260 --> 23:16.526
Yeah, but that dude's actually sick.

23:16.730 --> 23:20.035
No, no, no.
What Jackson means to say is...

23:20.560 --> 23:23.131
Has anyone been down to talk to you yet?

23:23.982 --> 23:27.059
Okay, just excuse us for a minute, okay?

23:29.956 --> 23:31.658
Bodies are stacking up out there.

23:31.744 --> 23:34.332
Yeah, I know, which is why you
need to get your Freud on.

23:34.382 --> 23:35.183
Chop, chop.

23:35.233 --> 23:39.107
You need to, you know,
shrink her, mobilize her legs.

23:39.157 --> 23:40.683
You want me to analyze her?

23:40.733 --> 23:42.289
Don't you think that's above my pay grade?

23:42.339 --> 23:44.802
Maybe, but I don't do feelings,
especially other people's.

23:44.852 --> 23:46.072
Yeah, what makes you think I do?

23:46.122 --> 23:47.338
You're a nurse.

23:49.659 --> 23:50.874
Okay, uh,

23:50.924 --> 23:53.351
Dr. Hamza said
something triggered her this morning.

23:53.653 --> 23:54.700
[sighs]

23:54.702 --> 23:56.425
She mentioned a friend... Samantha Smith.

23:56.475 --> 23:57.491
Smitts.

23:57.601 --> 24:00.125
She was a patient here.
Something about an anniversary.

24:00.175 --> 24:01.508
Okay, good. Let's start there.

24:01.510 --> 24:02.611
I'll track down her chart.

24:02.661 --> 24:03.893
Good.

24:04.241 --> 24:06.212

24:25.759 --> 24:27.798
Thank you. That's it.

24:30.028 --> 24:32.901
Okay, let's see what we've got in here.

24:34.172 --> 24:36.786
- Wait. Damn it.
- What is that?

24:37.512 --> 24:40.385
It looks like the tumor's
invading the transverse colon.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.133
Which didn't show up on the C.T.

24:42.183 --> 24:43.867
No. It certainly did not.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.407
So, what do we do?

24:45.540 --> 24:47.743
We take a second to reorient ourselves,

24:47.793 --> 24:49.660
and then we keep going.

24:50.515 --> 24:52.000
Pliers.

24:59.190 --> 25:01.080
This tumor
is attached to everything.

25:01.130 --> 25:02.765
So, that means we close, right?

25:02.883 --> 25:05.428
No, it does not. I can do this.

25:05.478 --> 25:08.269
[monitor beeping rapidly]

25:08.665 --> 25:10.716
Dr. Reid, pressure's dropping.

25:10.766 --> 25:13.032
Give him a dopamine drip, stabilize him.

25:13.255 --> 25:14.150
We should close.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.742
At least he'd have some
time with his family.

25:15.792 --> 25:17.697
Not helping, Dr. Mirani.

25:18.355 --> 25:20.148
Um, Dr. Reid, with all due respect,

25:20.198 --> 25:21.876
if we keep going, this patient could die.

25:21.926 --> 25:23.690
This is my little brother's best friend.

25:23.785 --> 25:25.040
He would've wanted me to try,

25:25.090 --> 25:27.113
and that is exactly what I'm going to do.

25:27.391 --> 25:28.940
I'm sorry.

25:31.162 --> 25:33.103
Okay. We're back in business.

25:33.322 --> 25:36.011
Beginning the transection
of the body of the pancreas.

25:36.815 --> 25:37.674
Whoa, okay.

25:37.724 --> 25:39.201
The tie has come off the splenic artery.

25:39.251 --> 25:40.838
I need you to apply pressure, please.

25:40.888 --> 25:42.342
Clamp.

25:43.863 --> 25:45.212
Clamping.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.274
Pickups.

25:48.125 --> 25:50.877
Suction, please,
while I continue to dissect.

25:51.610 --> 25:52.899
Tie.

25:56.957 --> 25:58.419
How's he doing, Baumann?

25:59.834 --> 26:01.794
Pressure's holding.

26:02.837 --> 26:05.557
Okay, he is doubly tied now.

26:06.604 --> 26:09.289
What do you say
we get the rest of this out of him?

26:15.091 --> 26:16.886
Okay, I have it.

26:18.909 --> 26:20.650
Oh, my god.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.354
I'll take this to pathology.

26:24.527 --> 26:26.939
Make sure the margins are clean
and there are no cancer cells.

26:26.989 --> 26:28.172
Call me when you're done.

26:29.619 --> 26:31.168
Dr. Mirani.

26:31.642 --> 26:32.696
Thank you.

26:32.802 --> 26:34.382
Uh, you're welcome.

26:34.480 --> 26:37.357
I mean, thank you.

26:41.009 --> 26:42.176

26:43.880 --> 26:45.580
So, our chicken lady...

26:45.711 --> 26:46.828
Found her friend's chart.

26:46.878 --> 26:49.337
Oh. Let's see what we got here.

26:53.261 --> 26:54.771
Wait a minute.

26:55.747 --> 26:58.722
I remember this girl.
She came in here with a TBI.

26:58.816 --> 26:59.958
Drinking and driving.

27:00.008 --> 27:01.846
We couldn't save her. She died.

27:01.984 --> 27:04.818
Year ago today.
Could this have triggered it?

27:04.896 --> 27:07.895
The anniversary of her friend's death.

27:08.565 --> 27:09.820
Yeah.

27:10.361 --> 27:12.278
I'd say that's a bingo.

27:34.195 --> 27:35.695
Uh, not yet.

27:37.731 --> 27:39.331
Hey, why don't you, uh, tell me

27:39.333 --> 27:41.066
a little about this party tonight.

27:42.180 --> 27:44.159
Um, it's a get-together.

27:44.209 --> 27:45.770
Friends and family.

27:46.379 --> 27:48.006
It's like a reunion.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.608
Samantha Smitts.

27:54.180 --> 27:55.862
It's okay.

27:57.782 --> 27:59.927
Tell you what, why don't we...

28:00.040 --> 28:02.608
why don't we call over there right now and

28:02.706 --> 28:04.158
tell them
you're not gonna make it, okay?

28:04.208 --> 28:05.956
- I got their number right here.
- No.

28:06.105 --> 28:08.449
I don't think that's a good idea.

28:08.661 --> 28:10.303
Why?

28:11.809 --> 28:14.255
What would you tell them?

28:17.787 --> 28:19.778
Say I'm sorry.

28:23.208 --> 28:25.709
Sorry I couldn't pick her up that night.

28:27.564 --> 28:29.246
The designated driver?

28:29.296 --> 28:31.949
It was always my responsibility.

28:32.346 --> 28:34.259
That must've been exhausting.

Always being the responsible one.

I should've been there.
