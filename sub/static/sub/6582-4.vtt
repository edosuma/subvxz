13:46.808 --> 13:50.460
♪ For they won't come inside ♪

13:51.413 --> 13:53.429
♪ Cry me a river, spin... ♪

13:53.431 --> 13:55.765
I've been thinking about what you said

13:55.767 --> 13:57.851
about giving up guys.

13:57.853 --> 14:00.487
Crazy, huh? Could you do it?

14:00.489 --> 14:03.223
Absolutely. Relationships
are difficult.

14:03.225 --> 14:06.125
Especially when you feel
like you're never enough.

14:07.295 --> 14:08.695
I hate that.

14:08.697 --> 14:11.431
Feeling like you're a
disappointment to someone.

14:15.103 --> 14:17.370
What are you thinking about right now?

14:20.091 --> 14:21.641
My dad.

14:23.528 --> 14:25.061
How much I miss him.

14:25.997 --> 14:29.582
♪ Come back, come back ♪

14:34.105 --> 14:37.740
You said the Prince was wearing this
when he woke up. How is that possible?

14:37.742 --> 14:39.993
Because he was black-out drunk, sir.

14:39.995 --> 14:43.162
There's this thing called moderation.
You kids should try it.

14:43.164 --> 14:46.866
And apart from this initial occasion,
there's been no other contact?

14:46.868 --> 14:48.585
No, not as far as I can tell.

14:48.587 --> 14:50.119
Okay, I'll look into it.

14:50.121 --> 14:52.255
I'll let you know if I find anything.

15:24.130 --> 15:26.264
(Hairdryer whirs)

15:34.440 --> 15:36.541
Mr. Moorefield, you look a fright!

15:36.543 --> 15:39.377
I'd offer you some tea,
but I don't care to.

15:39.379 --> 15:42.079
I can't do this, seduce the princesses.

15:42.081 --> 15:43.848
One is completely dim

15:43.850 --> 15:46.484
and plying me with the
most unfortunate selfies,

15:46.486 --> 15:48.886
and the other one, well, who
knows what she's gonna look like

15:48.888 --> 15:51.072
when she emerges from the mummy's tomb?

15:51.074 --> 15:53.457
You can and you will.

15:54.377 --> 15:59.397
We need hard evidence to prove those
dum-dums are unfit. Every selfie helps.

15:59.399 --> 16:01.232
I understand, but I can't.

16:02.318 --> 16:03.885
I won't.

16:07.307 --> 16:08.573
Hi, my love.

16:10.476 --> 16:13.294
It's me, Maribel. Do you still want me?

16:15.014 --> 16:16.914
(Giggles) It's supposed to be a secret.

16:16.916 --> 16:17.982
Ssh.

16:17.984 --> 16:19.917
(Hums gleefully)

16:21.287 --> 16:23.371
Okay, I'll do it.

16:27.527 --> 16:29.777
It's reprehensible what you're doing.

16:29.779 --> 16:32.680
Your Majesty, if you're
speaking of your daughters...

16:32.682 --> 16:35.533
I couldn't care less about
those drunken mistakes.

16:35.535 --> 16:38.636
I'm referring to your
actionable behavior toward me.

16:39.706 --> 16:42.790
Your Majesty, I respect your
right to defend the Crown.

16:42.792 --> 16:45.326
But I would hope that you
would also respect the fact

16:45.328 --> 16:47.228
that not everyone supports your reign.

16:47.230 --> 16:49.080
Let me get this straight.

16:49.082 --> 16:51.148
You come into my house,

16:51.150 --> 16:53.901
you do whatever the hell it is
you're doing to my daughters,

16:53.903 --> 16:56.520
and you ask me to respect you?

16:56.522 --> 16:58.522
Why on earth would I do that?

16:58.524 --> 17:00.258
The previous king did.

17:01.477 --> 17:05.396
Moorefield, you're absolutely right.

17:05.397 --> 17:07.982
I know that many of you here today

17:07.983 --> 17:11.868
loved and supported my
brother, just as I did.

17:14.173 --> 17:15.772
But in this day and age,

17:15.775 --> 17:17.825
it's important that we respect

17:17.827 --> 17:20.845
and encourage all ideologies.

17:20.847 --> 17:23.998
To some, this monument is divisive.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.550
It represents an institution
they don't believe in.

17:28.655 --> 17:30.888
So, as a unifying gesture to all,

17:30.890 --> 17:34.325
both monarchists and anti-monarchists,

17:34.327 --> 17:39.080
the unveiling of this
monument is hereby canceled.

17:39.082 --> 17:41.966
- No!
- (Crowd jeers)

17:41.968 --> 17:44.435
I know my brother would support this.

17:45.455 --> 17:49.774
Honoring his desire to
include all points of view

17:49.776 --> 17:53.978
is the true tribute... to his legacy.

17:53.980 --> 17:56.080
(Crowd jeers)

17:58.668 --> 18:01.268
- You son of a bitch!
- Oh, here we go.

18:01.270 --> 18:04.739
How could you be so
threatened by a dead man

18:04.741 --> 18:07.591
that you can't allow his
name on a piece of glass?

18:07.593 --> 18:10.144
And how could you be
so threatened by me

18:10.146 --> 18:11.529
that you would conspire

18:11.531 --> 18:14.498
to have me removed from my throne?

18:14.500 --> 18:16.434
Changing the order of succession

18:16.436 --> 18:18.686
so you can then have me eliminated?

18:18.688 --> 18:20.871
Is that what this is? I told you

18:20.873 --> 18:23.874
I didn't give a shit about
your reign and I don't!

18:23.876 --> 18:26.477
We both know you won't be
around for long anyway.

18:26.479 --> 18:28.012
What's that supposed to mean?

18:28.014 --> 18:31.749
It means you're a cancerous
dead king walking.

18:31.751 --> 18:33.818
Which also means there's a God.

18:35.104 --> 18:38.222
Get out! Or I'll have you
removed by palace guards!

18:38.224 --> 18:41.876
You listen to me, little man! The
monument is going to happen!

18:41.878 --> 18:43.894
No, it isn't! And for your information,

18:43.896 --> 18:45.780
the King sort of runs
things around here!

18:45.782 --> 18:47.865
Oh, do you really believe that?

18:47.867 --> 18:50.184
Because you don't. I do.

18:50.186 --> 18:52.069
I put you on the throne.

18:52.071 --> 18:55.089
And I humiliated myself
with the paternity scandal.

18:55.091 --> 18:57.391
And now you're trying to
rehabilitate your image

18:57.393 --> 18:58.909
with this monument.

18:58.911 --> 19:01.278
It's no wonder you had
them make it out of glass,

19:01.280 --> 19:03.814
it's all so transparent!

19:03.816 --> 19:06.650
This monument will stand
for the rest of time.

19:06.652 --> 19:08.252
Or, so help me God,

19:08.254 --> 19:10.488
cancer will be the
least of your worries.

19:16.829 --> 19:18.462
(Sighs deeply)

19:46.751 --> 19:48.684
Interesting address.

20:03.701 --> 20:06.686
- Take it away.
- You need it if you want to get well.

20:06.688 --> 20:09.538
- I'm not getting well.
- You're not even trying.

20:22.787 --> 20:26.022
I don't know why you're
wasting your time with me.

20:26.024 --> 20:28.207
I'm not wasting my time.

20:28.209 --> 20:30.693
- Maybe I find you...
- Pathetic.

20:31.829 --> 20:33.913
..attractive.

20:36.350 --> 20:38.968
You realize I have testicular cancer?

20:38.970 --> 20:42.004
There's probably nothing
working down there anyway.

21:25.716 --> 21:27.817
Eat your turnips.

21:27.819 --> 21:30.386
They're cruciferous.

21:36.744 --> 21:39.995
Looks to me like everything's
working just fine.

21:59.951 --> 22:01.550
(Message alert)

22:06.440 --> 22:09.341
'This monument is hereby canceled.'

22:11.696 --> 22:13.813
(Jeering)

22:15.233 --> 22:19.969
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!

22:19.971 --> 22:22.271
The dedication has been canceled.

22:22.273 --> 22:25.508
Please disperse in an orderly fashion.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.877
(Cheering)

22:38.789 --> 22:41.257
Now, I heard you were
all throwing a party.

22:41.259 --> 22:43.475
(Cheering)

22:44.896 --> 22:46.996
I know what King Cyrus said today.

22:46.998 --> 22:49.565
And while I agree with the
spirit of what he had to say

22:49.567 --> 22:51.734
about respecting
everyone's point of view,

22:51.736 --> 22:55.538
I don't think for a second
his intentions were sincere.

22:55.540 --> 22:58.073
(Murmurs of agreement)

22:58.075 --> 23:00.142
King Simon was a great man.

23:00.144 --> 23:02.178
(Cheering)

23:02.180 --> 23:04.613
You know it, I know it,

23:04.615 --> 23:07.900
and the men who've been instructed
to guard this monument know it.

23:07.902 --> 23:10.219
I can't fault them for doing their job,

23:10.221 --> 23:12.338
but what I'm gonna ask them to do

23:12.340 --> 23:15.407
is to remember the man whose
legacy was etched in that glass.

23:15.409 --> 23:16.859
(Cheering)

23:16.861 --> 23:19.929
Remember what he stood for
and what he stood against.

23:19.931 --> 23:22.698
And remember how much he
believed in all of us.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.617
(CROWD) Yes!

23:24.619 --> 23:26.969
If you don't believe in the monarchy,

23:26.971 --> 23:29.822
if you don't support it, that's fine.

23:30.741 --> 23:32.575
Some days I don't support it either.

23:33.511 --> 23:35.444
But consider the man.

23:35.880 --> 23:38.914
And ask yourself if he's
worthy of being remembered.

23:38.916 --> 23:40.716
(Cheering and applause)

23:40.718 --> 23:43.552
Not just as a king, or a monarch...

23:44.755 --> 23:49.191
..but as someone who believed
in the great in Great Britain.

23:49.193 --> 23:51.493
(Cheering)

23:52.463 --> 23:54.546
My father believed in you.

23:54.548 --> 23:56.232
He believed in me.

23:56.234 --> 23:58.000
He gave his life

23:58.002 --> 24:01.403
to make his country and
his family better.

24:04.976 --> 24:07.443
Now, there are some brave
men standing behind me,

24:07.445 --> 24:11.146
but I'm gonna ask them to
stand down and let me pass.

24:14.151 --> 24:16.235
Because in your hearts,

24:16.237 --> 24:18.721
you know the man
deserves this monument.

24:18.723 --> 24:20.389
(Cheering)

24:22.560 --> 24:25.044
He deserves a thousand monuments.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.595
(Cheering)

24:29.750 --> 24:31.784
Long live Great Britain!

24:32.536 --> 24:34.703
(Cheering)

24:45.349 --> 24:47.516
(Whistling and cheering)

24:57.003 --> 24:58.502
(Giggling)

25:01.074 --> 25:03.357
(They laugh)

25:04.494 --> 25:07.228
- Ssh.
- Whoa.

25:07.230 --> 25:10.531
Oh, yes. Not my finest
moment right there.

25:10.533 --> 25:12.566
I like it, actually.

25:13.269 --> 25:15.470
- Great room.
- Thanks.

25:16.439 --> 25:18.289
Um...don't you have a drug problem?

25:18.291 --> 25:19.841
Yeah, well, you know,

25:19.843 --> 25:22.076
problems are meant to be solved, so...

25:23.046 --> 25:24.812
..boys first, drugs later?

25:24.814 --> 25:26.531
Alright.

25:26.533 --> 25:29.550
Well, thanks for hanging
out with me today.

25:29.552 --> 25:32.553
Even though it was almost all
completely touristy stuff.

25:32.555 --> 25:36.491
Honestly, I've never taken the time to
do any of those things before, ever.

25:36.493 --> 25:37.925
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:37.927 --> 25:40.528
I blame, um, boys and drugs.

25:40.530 --> 25:42.163
- (Laughs)
- If I had known that

25:42.165 --> 25:43.631
I could have had that much fun,

25:43.633 --> 25:45.700
I would have ditched the guys ages ago.

25:48.571 --> 25:49.871
(Bubbling)

25:49.873 --> 25:52.190
Give me some of that.

25:52.192 --> 25:54.942
- (Inhales) Here.
- Mm-mm.

25:59.415 --> 26:01.282
- Oh.
- Um...

26:01.284 --> 26:03.801
Oh. Hm. Oh, my God,

26:03.803 --> 26:06.103
I completely misread
that whole situation.

26:06.105 --> 26:08.356
- No, it's okay.
- No, no, it's not.

26:08.358 --> 26:10.374
Mandy, honestly, it's fine, okay?

26:10.376 --> 26:12.493
It's just...

26:12.495 --> 26:14.762
Um... (Sighs)

26:14.764 --> 26:18.432
I realized this morning when I was
scrolling through my phone that

26:18.434 --> 26:21.068
I really don't have a lot of friends.

26:21.070 --> 26:23.538
I have my brother and
I have the monarchy.

26:25.859 --> 26:28.626
But I had a really fun day today.

26:28.628 --> 26:32.113
Like, the best day I can
probably remember, ever.

26:34.133 --> 26:36.651
I just don't want to, um...

26:39.122 --> 26:41.189
I feel like you're gonna
be important to me.

26:41.191 --> 26:42.957
Aw!

26:42.959 --> 26:45.526
Important enough not
to make out with me?

26:45.528 --> 26:47.495
(Laughs) Come on.

26:47.497 --> 26:49.697
Let's not get completely
ahead of ourselves.

26:49.699 --> 26:51.032
Okay, can I at least get a hug?

26:51.034 --> 26:53.367
- Yeah, you can have a hug.
- Okay.

26:56.773 --> 26:58.206
(Clears throat)

27:01.211 --> 27:04.395
I just... I'm... One minute, okay?

27:04.397 --> 27:06.113
I'll be right back.

27:08.051 --> 27:10.635
♪ We're the wild ones ♪

27:10.637 --> 27:13.221
Um, is everything okay?

27:15.291 --> 27:17.358
Yeah.

27:17.360 --> 27:20.011
Everything's surprisingly great.

27:21.397 --> 27:24.031
For the first time in,
like, a really long time.

27:27.587 --> 27:31.239

(Footsteps)

27:41.184 --> 27:42.750
Quite a day.

27:42.752 --> 27:44.852
Have you come to beat me up again?

27:44.854 --> 27:49.223
"Illegitimate bastard
attacks cancer patient."

27:49.225 --> 27:52.260
Go ahead and make your jokes.
We both know the truth.

27:52.262 --> 27:55.096
- What truth do we know?
- No matter what you do,

27:55.098 --> 27:57.231
no matter who you think you've become,

27:57.233 --> 27:58.883
it will never be enough.

27:58.885 --> 28:02.470
I'm the King of England,
you little bitch.

28:02.472 --> 28:04.155
It is enough.

28:04.157 --> 28:06.908
Do you really think your speech today

28:06.910 --> 28:08.509
makes you at all relevant?

28:08.511 --> 28:10.544
You babbled a few cliches

28:10.546 --> 28:12.880
to a brood of sentimental failures.

28:12.882 --> 28:15.299
It wasn't about me. It was
about reminding the world

28:15.301 --> 28:17.351
how great our last king was.

28:18.922 --> 28:20.721
And how far we've fallen.

28:22.659 --> 28:24.709
Sucks about the cancer.

28:24.711 --> 28:26.761
But let's face it,

28:26.763 --> 28:29.330
you've never had any balls anyway.

28:46.149 --> 28:49.100
- (Gasps)
- She keeps it over there.

28:49.102 --> 28:51.986
I looked there. I think she's moved it.

28:51.988 --> 28:54.689
She's crafty, your sister.

29:00.346 --> 29:04.065
Unbelievable. It's my weed.

29:04.067 --> 29:06.584
(QUEEN HELENA) Stop
being such a princess.

29:07.637 --> 29:09.737
Didn't your mother teach you to share?

29:09.739 --> 29:11.706
No.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.908
I don't know why you're
giving this to me,

29:13.910 --> 29:15.826
I just came out here
to get some fresh air.

29:15.828 --> 29:17.745
Oh, for God's sake, give me the pot.

29:37.266 --> 29:39.800
Don't look at me like
that, you little brats.

29:39.802 --> 29:41.769
You'll harsh my buzz.

29:41.771 --> 29:43.437
(Chuckles)

29:44.374 --> 29:47.842
I was proud of you, for how
you handled yourself today.

29:48.978 --> 29:51.078
The people were inspired.

29:51.080 --> 29:54.465
No one from our family's done
that since your father died.

29:54.467 --> 29:56.384
Oh, wow, thank you, Mum.

29:56.386 --> 29:58.252
Please, smoke my weed and insult me.

29:58.254 --> 30:01.222
Oh, shut up. I was just trying to give
your brother a compliment for once.

30:01.224 --> 30:03.307
Yes, shut up.

30:09.899 --> 30:11.966
Say no to drugs.

30:13.736 --> 30:16.987
You know, I thought I knew
what life would be like

30:16.989 --> 30:19.306
for you both, and Robert.

30:20.810 --> 30:23.077
But I think even I underestimated

30:23.079 --> 30:25.880
just how isolating it would be for you.

30:25.882 --> 30:28.215
For all of us.

30:31.487 --> 30:33.954
No, I've been high all day.

30:39.262 --> 30:42.063
You think we have it
tough, take a look around.

30:42.065 --> 30:44.415
People struggle all the time.

30:45.868 --> 30:47.501
They do the very best they can

30:47.503 --> 30:50.087
and they fight to live another day.

30:52.725 --> 30:54.842
We all do.

30:54.844 --> 30:56.977
Yeah, but we do it from a palace.

30:59.115 --> 31:01.849
You both have Simon's tenacity.

31:01.851 --> 31:03.901
And his strength.

31:06.189 --> 31:08.355
He was right, you know.

31:10.026 --> 31:12.827
The only way to survive any of this

31:12.829 --> 31:16.080
is to choose love.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.167
And to help each other.

31:23.289 --> 31:25.422
Are you okay, Mum?

31:26.375 --> 31:28.542
I'm just tired.

32:06.210 --> 32:07.576
Shall we?

32:08.813 --> 32:10.913
(Shutters click)

32:10.915 --> 32:13.015
(Clamoring)

32:15.836 --> 32:17.953
(Gunshots)

32:17.955 --> 32:20.022
(Screaming)

32:30.067 --> 32:31.834
It's alright. I got it. Stay with me.

32:31.836 --> 32:33.569
Stay with me. Stay with me.

32:33.571 --> 32:34.703
Keep it...

32:35.706 --> 32:37.573
I've got you. I've got you.
I've got you.

32:37.575 --> 32:39.775
Someone get me an ambulance now!

33:36.467 --> 33:39.318
My God, you're huge!

33:40.604 --> 33:42.588
Wait! Please?

33:44.808 --> 33:48.527
Are you absolutely sure it's a boy?

33:48.529 --> 33:50.445
Yes.

34:02.860 --> 34:05.794
- Hello, James.
- Princess.

34:07.665 --> 34:10.197
I apologize for sneaking away today.

34:10.199 --> 34:13.302
It's sort of an initiation
for my security detail.

34:13.304 --> 34:15.003
- I understand.
- Okay.

34:15.005 --> 34:17.438
Not your finest hour at
the Albert Memorial.

34:18.792 --> 34:22.678
But the Japanese tourists below you
experienced quite the contact high.

34:23.547 --> 34:25.397
Next time you need a little space,

34:25.399 --> 34:26.815
just ask me, Your Highness.

34:28.518 --> 34:32.321
Mr. Hill, there's a slight
chance you might amuse me.

34:32.322 --> 34:34.406
Night, Princess.

34:35.359 --> 34:37.476
(BEAR'S DEN: When You Break)

34:39.263 --> 34:42.264
I hope you don't mind, I made
myself more comfortable.

34:42.266 --> 34:44.266
I don't mind at all.

34:45.803 --> 34:47.936
I was just talking with my mum.

34:47.938 --> 34:49.538
You mean the Queen of England?

34:49.540 --> 34:51.306
That very one.

34:52.176 --> 34:55.744
And what, pray tell, did the
Queen of England have to say?

34:59.883 --> 35:02.351
She was telling me to be happy

35:02.353 --> 35:04.086
and to follow my heart.

35:05.255 --> 35:06.722
Sound advice.

39:00.424 --> 39:04.025

39:05.095 --> 39:07.145
..not simply exact revenge,

39:07.147 --> 39:09.197
not simply amend injustice,
