01:07.160 --> 01:11.233
There's always a price to pay
when you hire an assassin -

01:11.320 --> 01:14.278
from ten to hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

01:14.360 --> 01:17.670
Recently, a mysterious killer
has appeared in Hong Kong.

01:17.760 --> 01:20.718
He asks for no payment
for his services.

01:20.800 --> 01:25.271
He eliminates his targets - all evil
men - because they deserve to die.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.510
In the World of professional killers,

01:27.600 --> 01:31.229
this vigilante is considered
to be the king of killers.

01:31.320 --> 01:35.711
Others who live in fear know him
as the "Angel of Death"

02:24.000 --> 02:26.878
Check Zone A.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.837
You check Zone B.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.717
Make sure everything's in order.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.153
Follow me.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.956
- Good evening, sir.
- All leveIs have been secured, sir.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.716
- Is the boss still in there?
- Yes, sir.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.313
Stay alert.

03:06.560 --> 03:12.078
Of all women, I find the Chinese
are the most exciting in bed.

03:12.160 --> 03:15.118
How could they
be better than Japanese women?

03:15.200 --> 03:18.829
Because their strong sense of moral
values makes them highly reserved.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.674
I remember sleeping with them
during the war.

03:22.760 --> 03:26.309
I'd hear their screams of pain,
begging me to stop,

03:26.400 --> 03:28.994
but it just made me more excited.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.799
Japanese women can do that too.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.834
No, it's not the same at all.

03:36.760 --> 03:39.558
How i long for those days.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.673
Find out what's happening!

03:45.760 --> 03:46.954
Sasaki?

03:47.040 --> 03:51.113
- What's going on?
- We're checking, don't worry, sir.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.350
- Check for intruders.
- Sir!

03:56.400 --> 03:58.072
Some sake?

03:59.680 --> 04:02.638
Something's wrong with the monitor.
Check it out.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.991
Sir, he's out cold.
Someone must've broken in.

04:21.079 --> 04:22.593
Check the surrounding monitors.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.513
Shut all elevator power immediately!
Do you read me?

04:25.600 --> 04:27.591
Control, do you read me?

05:15.360 --> 05:16.713
Sasaki?

05:37.640 --> 05:38.993
Shut up!

05:49.600 --> 05:52.239
So, who hired you to kill me?

05:52.320 --> 05:54.515
I’ll make you an offer.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.997
I’ll pay you three times what he did.

05:59.720 --> 06:03.235
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.273
If you kill me,
you'll also end up dead.

06:06.360 --> 06:10.239
You'll be hunted down by professional
hitmen from all over the World.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.995
Yes, and whoever kills you
will receive a huge reward.

06:15.480 --> 06:20.474
They'll all be after your head.
So if l were you, I’d just go.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.118
Leave while you still can.

06:35.320 --> 06:38.915
You stupid idiot! You've just signed
your own death warrant!

06:49.760 --> 06:51.239
Excuse me.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.077
- Ma'am, i...
- One minute.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.276
But you gave me the wrong change.

07:06.360 --> 07:10.512
It says there that these are on sale
for haIf this price.

07:10.600 --> 07:16.596
Let me see. Hey, Jerry, you forgot
to remove the old tags again.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.157
Can l have my money back?

07:19.240 --> 07:20.753
l already punched it in.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.877
Do me a favour,
go and get something else!

07:23.960 --> 07:25.916
But I’ve got everything l need.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.788
Can't you see the queue?
You're delaying the other customers!

07:30.240 --> 07:32.674
Then give me my change.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.868
- There!
- Thanks.

08:16.720 --> 08:19.757
Hey, you cheat, move on.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.677
Hello there.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.996
..I walked behind him,
and called out.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.789
He turned around and i shot him!
Right in the forehead!

09:31.880 --> 09:34.394
His head exploded like a watermelon!

09:34.480 --> 09:37.790
I left him there,
his brains splattered everywhere!

09:38.240 --> 09:41.277
Shooting through the heart
is much cleaner and quicker.

09:41.360 --> 09:45.194
Joey, don't you have
another assignment for us yet?

09:45.280 --> 09:47.191
We could do with the cash.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.236
There's one coming up,
and you're all in.

09:50.840 --> 09:54.310
- Fred, have you called your mom yet?
- No.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.992
She's your only family, right?

09:56.080 --> 10:01.200
In that case, why don't you come? You
could get lots of money to send her.

10:01.280 --> 10:04.431
Why don't you buy
a new pair of pants?

10:04.520 --> 10:06.476
These are very comfortable.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.999
All right, you two,
you'll be coming with me to Macao.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.389
Joey, can i use this a while?

10:18.520 --> 10:21.796
You've got some nerve
freeloading off me like this!

10:21.880 --> 10:26.237
- Joey, I haven't called my mother...
- I don't give a damn!

10:26.320 --> 10:29.153
I gave you that assignment
to kill Mrs Chu...

10:29.240 --> 10:31.117
and you repair her drainpipes!

10:31.200 --> 10:34.909
She needed my help -
besides she reminded me of my mom.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.198
What about that knife i gave you
you used to cut your target's steak?

10:39.280 --> 10:41.236
But he couldn't even chew properly.

10:41.320 --> 10:44.790
And you call yourseIf
a soldier of the Golden Triangle.

10:44.880 --> 10:48.998
Some tough guy! Maybe you should
leave and stop wasting my time.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.674
All i really need is one big hit.

10:51.760 --> 10:55.355
- Not for just a few thousand...
- Like a hundred million?

10:55.440 --> 10:58.796
- Are you kidding?
- Do i look like I’m kidding?

10:58.880 --> 11:03.749
- A hundred million US dollars!
- Let me do it, boss. Come on!

11:03.840 --> 11:06.354
Get serious!
These guys want first-class killers.

11:06.440 --> 11:09.910
- I could be a first-class killer.
- Really.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.437
You look more like first-class jerks
to me. Hell, forget about Macao.

11:14.520 --> 11:17.796
- Hey, come on, boss.
- Wait up, wait up.

11:19.600 --> 11:23.354
Joey, could you tell me
where i can sign up for that?

11:23.440 --> 11:25.396
Please, help me.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.436
You really want that job?

11:27.520 --> 11:30.114
OK, go to the Tsukamoto Centre
tomorrow morning.

11:30.200 --> 11:35.558
Someone might just notice
your rags and toss you a few cents.

12:09.520 --> 12:13.399
Eiji, the fund manager's here.
You'd better come and meet him.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.470
Eiji, what is your problem?

12:22.040 --> 12:25.999
I was wondering how
a great man such as my grandfather

12:26.080 --> 12:30.278
could end up with such
a worthless son, the likes of you.

12:30.360 --> 12:33.238
You've no right
to talk to me like that.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.914
It was your father who was killed

12:36.000 --> 12:39.276
and you're not doing anything
to avenge his death.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.351
He's taken care of that.

12:45.560 --> 12:48.757
Only because
you don't have the guts to do it.

12:48.840 --> 12:52.549
Useless people like you
will be the downfall of Japan.

12:54.160 --> 12:58.199
You're not even capable of running
your own father's business.

12:58.280 --> 13:01.238
Well, I’m in charge now.
I’ve inherited everything.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.113
You don't even have
a sense of honour.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.078
That's what grandfather and i
had in common.

13:09.160 --> 13:11.469
Eiji, your grandfather's ashes
are in there!

13:18.280 --> 13:20.510
No! No!

13:20.600 --> 13:22.716
These are my grandfather's ashes.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.997
Eat them and he shall live
inside you. Go on!

13:26.080 --> 13:27.229
You're mad!

13:29.440 --> 13:31.635
You're nothing but an old coward.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.757
You don't deserve
his ashes inside you.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.279
No! Stop!

13:42.920 --> 13:44.273
You really are mad!

13:46.200 --> 13:52.355
The board will hear about this.
Let's go! Come on! Come on!

13:52.600 --> 13:56.115
Sorry, Father. I’m afraid
they won't listen to you any longer.

13:56.200 --> 14:00.751
I have Grandfather's soul, so they
have no choice but to follow me now.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.751
You're all mad!

14:20.320 --> 14:21.878
Phew, he stinks!

14:25.400 --> 14:27.595
''A Day in the Life
of a Professsional Killer.''

14:27.680 --> 14:30.752
Grandpa, that man is really smelly.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.432
Quiet, now.

14:57.080 --> 15:00.197
The woman who just came in
is Anita May.

15:00.280 --> 15:03.909
She's 33 years old and runs
a prestigious modelling agency.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.719
No criminal record,
but according to Interpol,

15:06.800 --> 15:10.031
she's involved in
some of the biggest crimes in Europe.

15:10.120 --> 15:13.715
She recruits top European hitmen
to assassinate political figures.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.997
She probably gets her clients
from her modelling agency.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.838
- This is coffee?
- Well, it's decaff, sir.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.879
What's the point in drinking coffee
if it's decaff? Forget it.

15:25.080 --> 15:28.675
This is Chris Crado,
42 years old, runs a liquor business,

15:28.760 --> 15:30.318
no criminal record, sir.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.358
Aside from selling vodka,

15:32.440 --> 15:36.319
he acts as an agent for Russian gangs
operating all over Asia.

15:36.400 --> 15:40.109
Therefore he could easily get
in touch with Russian assassins.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.795
So why have all these agents appeared
at the Tsukamoto Centre?

15:43.880 --> 15:46.440
Aren't they afraid
of being caught together?

15:46.520 --> 15:51.036
It's because they all want the
one hundred million dollar reward.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.998
If you were a hitman,
you'd be here too.

15:54.080 --> 15:57.516
- Something's up, Captain.
- Zoom in, please.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.351
Look, if you don't have
an invitation, you'd better leave.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.955
Just give me a chance.
I’m the man for the job.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.600
What the hell are you talking about?

16:09.680 --> 16:12.274
- Please...
- Get out of here...

16:12.360 --> 16:14.078
I really need the money and...

16:14.160 --> 16:18.312
- Are you looking for trouble?
- Please, let me go, sir.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.277
Are you deaf? I said leave.

16:26.400 --> 16:32.475
Stop! Hold it right there! Do you
morons have any idea who this man is?

16:32.560 --> 16:34.949
He may stink and look like hell,

16:35.040 --> 16:37.918
but he's also the top hitman
in Mainland China!

16:38.000 --> 16:42.312
- So you're an assassin?
- l served at the Golden Triangle.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.311
Great! Just play it by ear.

16:44.400 --> 16:49.235
What? Do you know me?
Do you have any idea who I am? Well?

16:49.320 --> 16:54.348
You want to see my invitation?
Well, all you have to do is ask.

16:54.440 --> 16:58.797
Now, you listen. I want to speak
to your superior right away.

16:58.880 --> 17:02.395
- I am the superior.
- Then you understand the problem.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.232
Jerk, here!

17:07.000 --> 17:10.628
I’ll take you in,
but you do exactly what l say.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.912
Can you repeat that in Chinese?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.309
And in Japanese, if you like.

17:23.760 --> 17:27.195
Have you prepared
the bank draft, sir?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.555
Five million dollars in a Swiss bank.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.119
Thank you.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.158
- Five million?
- That's just for deposit.

17:37.040 --> 17:41.477
Attention, please. My name is Martin,
I’m Mr Tsukamoto's fund manager.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.439
If you need a translator,
use the earpiece in front of you

17:45.520 --> 17:48.034
and tune in
to the desired language channel.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.793
You're all aware of Mr Tsukamoto's
recent assassination.

17:50.880 --> 17:56.318
His will states that a reward
will be offered to avenge his death.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.233
Please turn on the computers
in front of you.

17:59.320 --> 18:04.235
Each of you has an account at
a Swiss bank with a balance of $5m.

18:04.320 --> 18:09.713
Please enter your four-digit private
code - your ID for your account.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.234
Whoever completes the mission

18:12.320 --> 18:17.792
will automatically receive the reward
into his or her account.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.472
And for everyone's convenience,

18:19.560 --> 18:22.996
I’ve filed all the details regarding
the death in your computers.

18:23.080 --> 18:27.392
You've all received the same
information to ensure a fair deal.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.596
I’ll repeat the terms again.

18:29.680 --> 18:33.434
The killer and the mastermind
are worth 50 million dollars each.

18:33.520 --> 18:38.116
If they are the same person,
then he is worth 100 million dollars.

18:46.520 --> 18:49.398
If there's official evidence
that either one doesn't exist

18:49.480 --> 18:54.838
or is already dead, the full reward
is for the remaining target.

19:00.040 --> 19:05.319
Ah, the right target. The right
target will be identified by us.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.836
We form a special committee
set up by Mr Tsukamoto.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.558
Regarding our professional details,

19:10.640 --> 19:13.871
all information can be accessed
on your computer.

19:13.960 --> 19:19.080
Lastly, I want to make this clear -
we do not encourage lawbreakers.

19:19.160 --> 19:20.991
We won't be held responsible

19:21.080 --> 19:23.992
should you become involved
in any illegal activities -

19:24.080 --> 19:25.479
you'll also be disqualified.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.915
- Police!
- This is a search warrant.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.391
Everyone please remain in your seats
and take out your identification.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.870
You're all suspected of being
involved in international crimes.

19:35.960 --> 19:39.111
Please cooperate,
if you don't want any trouble.

19:39.200 --> 19:43.716
I’d be more careful, if i were you.
We have two lawyers here, Officer.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.279
What's happening here?

19:45.360 --> 19:48.318
We're in the middle
of a legitimate business deal.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.198
I’ll have my secretary
send you a report.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.633
Great!

19:53.000 --> 19:55.560
Why do you have
so many discount coupons?

19:55.640 --> 19:58.632
- I collect them.
- And why so many coins?

19:58.720 --> 20:00.312
He collects them also, so?

20:00.400 --> 20:04.598
- And this knife?
- What about it? It's for cooking.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.319
- Can't he speak?
- I’m his manager.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.550
Everyone with talent needs a manager.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.312
So what's your talent?

20:11.400 --> 20:13.231
He's a great gymnast.

20:13.320 --> 20:16.471
He's also good at running,
although he needs more training.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.994
His record's
9.9 seconds for 100 metres.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.438
Let's go, men.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.237
Aren't we going to arrest them?

20:28.320 --> 20:30.754
If they want to play with fire...

20:43.320 --> 20:46.835
- Isn't that Tsukamoto's grandson?
- Yes, he's joining the hunt.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.797
Are family allowed take part?

21:05.760 --> 21:07.239
Mr Tsukamoto, sir.

21:15.320 --> 21:19.359
I don't like being interrupted
before my meal. What do you want?

21:19.440 --> 21:22.352
Actually, I also
have an appointment - a bridge game.

21:22.440 --> 21:25.352
And i promised my friends
l wouldn't be late.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.112
You Chinese talk a lot.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.918
If i were you, I’d get to the point.

21:31.560 --> 21:34.472
Your mere presence
is starting to irritate my men.

21:37.360 --> 21:40.238
All right.
I’ve gathered some new information.

21:40.320 --> 21:43.232
If it's about my grandfather's death,
I already know everything.

21:43.320 --> 21:46.596
Of course,
but something new has come up.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.433
Since your grandfather
didn't want the police involved,

21:49.520 --> 21:53.115
we had to use all our influence
to avold an autopsy.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.350
But we had someone examine him.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.000
And he discovered something
very interesting.

21:58.080 --> 22:01.993
- What do you want?
- You know what i want.

22:02.080 --> 22:06.232
I’ll give you the information,
but i want something in return.

22:06.320 --> 22:09.073
I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, right?

22:09.160 --> 22:10.513
And the others?

22:10.600 --> 22:15.720
You'll be first to get any news,
so long as you pay $100m each time.

22:18.440 --> 22:21.113
Aren't you the least bit
scared of me?

22:21.200 --> 22:25.432
I am, but I’m more afraid
of living miserably. Right?

22:31.200 --> 22:34.476
You can cash this cheque
any time of day.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.353
I just hope
your information is worth it.

22:41.160 --> 22:44.596
What we found in your grandfather's
body was a military banknote,

22:44.680 --> 22:46.352
dating from the Second World War.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.237
We still haven't decoded it,

22:48.320 --> 22:51.517
but our computers
will fix that in no time.

22:51.600 --> 22:54.876
- When?
- After I’ve cashed this cheque.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.155
Your meal is ready, Master Eiji.

22:58.480 --> 23:03.190
Remove the extra setting, he's not
eating, he might ruin my appetite.

23:04.840 --> 23:07.400
No problem,
I don't eat sashimi anyway.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.232
In fact, I hate it.

23:18.600 --> 23:19.953
On that night,

23:20.040 --> 23:23.715
most of the security cameras were
destroyed by Tsukomoto's murderer.

23:23.800 --> 23:28.794
But we do have some videos, recorded
days before the murder occurred.

23:28.880 --> 23:32.634
They also gave us a video
recorded the night of the murder.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.597
But although the killer is visible,

23:34.680 --> 23:38.514
he can't be identified
as his back is to the camera.

23:38.600 --> 23:41.717
Bill, you've seen the tape,
what do you think?

23:41.800 --> 23:44.360
I think
he's been in the centre before.

23:44.440 --> 23:48.797
He knew his way around and where
all the cameras were located.

23:48.880 --> 23:53.351
So there's no doubt he'd given
the place a thorough going over.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.553
Maybe he got hold of the blueprints.

23:57.640 --> 24:01.679
But most of the cameras were
installed under a month ago, sir.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.513
The blueprints wouldn't tell him
where they were.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.875
How do we trace the killer, then?

24:06.960 --> 24:09.872
Well, we could run his image
through the computer,

24:09.960 --> 24:12.190
together with anyone
who has been there.

24:12.280 --> 24:17.035
All right, get video tapes dating
back a month and start with that.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.473
Yes, sir.

24:18.560 --> 24:22.439
And Bill, don't let anyone
into the computer room.

24:39.400 --> 24:43.279
They used to be bigger.
What a rip off!

24:44.320 --> 24:48.313
What are you looking at?
You pervert!

24:48.480 --> 24:49.833
Get lost!

24:49.920 --> 24:51.148
Take it easy.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.595
He was staring
right down my cleavage!

24:55.440 --> 24:57.476
So, you like my watch?

24:57.720 --> 25:01.633
It's a Rolex, 24 karat gold-plated
and diamond studded.

25:01.720 --> 25:07.158
It's to commemorate the reunification
of Hong Kong with Mainland China.

25:07.240 --> 25:11.597
- Have it!
- I’ve never had a watch before.

25:11.680 --> 25:13.511
Now, I have a Rolex.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.150
Don't get too excited, it's a fake.

25:17.240 --> 25:19.754
You don't expect the real thing,
do you?

25:19.840 --> 25:23.435
Even so, in Tsim Sha Tsui,
this would cost about $800!

25:23.520 --> 25:26.432
This is the most expensive gift
I’ve ever received!

25:26.520 --> 25:29.034
- You're a Chinaman, all right.
- What?

25:29.120 --> 25:33.511
It's just that Mainland hitmen
charge between 40 and 50 thousand.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.512
You get 80 thousand
with 10 thousand down payment.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.909
But the reward was 100 million!

25:39.000 --> 25:43.278
I’m your agent, right? I have to pay
for everything, meals, transportation

25:43.360 --> 25:45.828
and i have to pay my informers.

25:45.920 --> 25:49.230
Don't you think your share
is just a little excessive?

25:49.320 --> 25:52.471
I invested 5 million dollars
without even knowing you.

25:52.560 --> 25:56.030
No-one would do that!
Or would you rather forget it?

25:56.120 --> 25:58.395
How about we split 60-40?

25:58.480 --> 26:02.155
- Not a chance!
- What about 70-30?

26:02.240 --> 26:05.596
All right, 80-20
and I’ll take the down payment.

26:07.280 --> 26:10.670
First of all, I just
want to make sure you can fight.

26:10.760 --> 26:13.320
And you must do everything
I tell you.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.675
Then tell me what you want.

26:15.760 --> 26:19.275
- You know what...
- Hey, you! Enough of your noise!

26:19.360 --> 26:20.634
You've got 30 seconds.

26:21.520 --> 26:24.876
I’ll give you something
to shout about! Get lost!

26:24.960 --> 26:26.791
You son-of-a-bitch!

26:39.760 --> 26:41.318
15 seconds, Norman.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.831
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

26:48.600 --> 26:50.158
Sorry, lady, excuse me.

26:50.480 --> 26:54.268
You wouldn't dare hit a woman!
Come on! Run away then!

26:57.640 --> 27:00.438
- What?
- But she's a lady.

27:00.520 --> 27:04.593
You don't hit ladies?
I’d better look for someone else.

27:04.680 --> 27:06.238
Wait, Norman!

27:07.840 --> 27:10.798
What you need
is a whole new wardrobe,

27:10.880 --> 27:13.838
if you want to be taken seriously
as a professional.

27:13.920 --> 27:17.549
There's nothing more impressive
than a stylish killer.

27:22.680 --> 27:25.638
- What's the matter?
- This costs $19,000!

27:25.720 --> 27:28.996
Well, if you dress expensive,
you look expensive.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.718
That's how it works.

27:31.120 --> 27:35.557
I was wondering if you could help us.
You see, my friend here, ah...

27:35.640 --> 27:38.359
he wants to try a new style.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.996
The ideal material is polyester.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.917
It's soft and tightly knit,

27:45.000 --> 27:48.072
so you won't leave fibres
on the crime scene.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.993
Long coats are good
for carrying weapons.

27:51.080 --> 27:55.437
Black suits look smarter and slicker.
And as for the hair...

27:55.520 --> 28:01.629
always use mousse to avold leaving
hair or dandruff on the scene.

28:10.840 --> 28:14.435
- What are they for?
- To make you look smarter.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.354
I’ll be in touch.
Take this pager.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.598
Where's my down payment?

28:26.680 --> 28:28.636
What about all these new clothes!

28:30.360 --> 28:32.715
Listen, don't follow me, all right?

28:32.800 --> 28:34.438
You will call?

28:36.400 --> 28:40.234
These clothes cost me $19,000,
of course I’ll call.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.634
His name is Norman Lu,
alias Crocodile Lu.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.676
His file's about an inch thick -

29:02.760 --> 29:06.992
theft, selling of porno tapes,
swindling and illegal gambling.

29:07.080 --> 29:10.834
I’m sure he's up to another scam,
acting as an agent.

29:10.920 --> 29:13.480
He did invest $5m
just like the others.

29:13.560 --> 29:16.120
Maybe he's cheating
the other agents, sir.

29:16.200 --> 29:19.556
He may be a swindler
but he's not that smart.

29:19.640 --> 29:21.551
So, what's he doing here?

29:22.560 --> 29:24.915
Are there any answers
in your computer?

29:25.000 --> 29:27.560
- No, sir.
- Let's go, then.

29:50.120 --> 29:53.078
Is there something wrong
with what I’m wearing?

29:53.160 --> 29:55.310
Course not, Fred, you look great.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.960
By the way, what's today's date?

30:01.040 --> 30:05.477
- The fourteenth.
- Ah, fourteen! One and four.

30:09.040 --> 30:12.749
I better find you a job
since you need some cash.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.598
Order whatever you want.

30:19.160 --> 30:21.879
Yeah, you're looking for
an exterminator?

30:22.720 --> 30:24.278
What's the salary?

30:24.680 --> 30:26.318
That's all?

30:27.520 --> 30:30.512
No thanks, we're not interested, bye.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.234
But, aren't we
going after the killer?

30:35.320 --> 30:39.871
We still have to work in the
meantime. We have to earn a living.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.152
Go ahead and eat.

30:44.240 --> 30:46.959
Someone told me
he's in a retirement home.

30:47.040 --> 30:52.592
- I heard he died a long time ago.
- Why didn't you say so?

30:52.680 --> 30:57.515
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Have any of you seen Mr Leung lately?

30:57.600 --> 30:59.352
Ah, yes, Mr Leung!

31:00.080 --> 31:02.355
Yes, do you know where he is?

31:02.440 --> 31:06.718
Well, you should ask Mrs Leung
about that. She knows everything.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.792
I bet! Thanks.

31:09.880 --> 31:13.634
Wait! We were just kidding.
You're looking for old man Leung?

31:13.720 --> 31:15.073
That's right.

31:15.160 --> 31:20.109
- He's been missing for a while.
- He hasn't come for tea in ages.

31:24.320 --> 31:26.231
Excuse me, enjoy your tea.

31:26.320 --> 31:30.916
Now there's a hard worker.
Did you see all the pagers he had?

31:31.000 --> 31:35.551
- You ate all that?
- No, I left this for you.

31:35.640 --> 31:39.713
How could you eat so much?
I’ll deal with you later.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.199
What an appetite!

31:43.560 --> 31:49.112
Jim, what's new, a new target? Good!
You gave the job to someone else?

31:49.960 --> 31:55.876
But I’ve got this guy, he's just
come from America, he's really slick.

31:55.960 --> 32:00.909
How did i get him? He wanted to spend
some time in South East Asia,

32:01.000 --> 32:05.471
so he came to Hong Kong to see
his old friend. 50 thousand's fine.

32:05.560 --> 32:10.998
Of course not, he comes out in a rash
if he doesn't kill regularly.

32:11.080 --> 32:13.719
Whoever gets him first,
gets the money?

32:13.800 --> 32:15.950
OK, OK, count us in then.

32:16.040 --> 32:23.276
Who's the target? Yeah... Right...
OK, get the money ready, thanks.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.399
What a pig!

32:25.480 --> 32:28.438
I eat three meals in one
to save time.

32:28.520 --> 32:31.751
More like three months of meals.
l think we'd better leave.

32:31.840 --> 32:34.559
- Wait, want take away?
- Take away?

32:36.120 --> 32:39.476
The terms of our business agreement
are as follows:

32:39.560 --> 32:42.597
Sometimes you may be required
to maim a target.

32:42.680 --> 32:47.800
8,000 for the left hand, 10,000 for a
leg , and 20% discount for both legs.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.314
- And the right hand?
- That's free.

32:50.400 --> 32:53.472
- Why?
- It always gets in the way.

32:53.560 --> 32:53.878
So it ends up as a freebie.

32:56.520 --> 32:59.159
Why don't you look around
for a while?

32:59.240 --> 33:00.593
What about you?

33:00.680 --> 33:04.878
I don't know the target,
so I’ve got to find my informer.

33:04.960 --> 33:10.592
- But there's so many kids around.
- Want me to chase them away first?

33:10.680 --> 33:12.238
Wait here.

33:15.800 --> 33:19.554
- I want some candy.
- Give me a pink one.

33:19.640 --> 33:22.996
Just hit the tile and you win, go on!

33:23.080 --> 33:25.071
Aw, you missed!

33:25.160 --> 33:27.310
I can do it, watch.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.828
- Need some help?
- No thanks.

33:34.920 --> 33:38.674
OK, if i lose your dollar,
I’ll give you five back.

33:38.760 --> 33:40.193
Deal!

33:40.960 --> 33:43.599
Try number two tile, I want Big Bird!

33:43.680 --> 33:45.238
That one?

33:48.280 --> 33:50.111
Hooray! I won Big Bird!

33:50.240 --> 33:52.708
Here you are mister,
toss another coin!

33:53.640 --> 33:56.518
- What number?
- Try number one.

33:59.800 --> 34:04.430
- Here mister, try it again!
- All right, 

34:05.305 --> 34:11.382
