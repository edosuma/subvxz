01:11.800 --> 01:13.966
So let's take
a look at the actual X-ray.

01:13.968 --> 01:15.168
I think you'll get
a better sense

01:15.170 --> 01:16.839
of what we're dealing with here.

01:17.773 --> 01:19.906
It's your lungs.

01:19.908 --> 01:22.611
You see up here in the corner,
that area that... that...

01:26.414 --> 01:28.447
Mr. Cady, we need
to talk about this.

01:28.449 --> 01:30.819
There's a lot...

02:46.194 --> 02:48.628
Drinking on the job again.

02:48.630 --> 02:50.032
Maybe I'll have one with you.

02:52.066 --> 02:54.503
Roy, you're working later.

02:55.570 --> 02:59.104
You and Angelo are visiting
Frank Sinkowski tonight.

02:59.106 --> 03:02.074
Feds are pressing
on the port probe.

03:02.076 --> 03:04.276
Nobody should get hurt bad.

03:04.278 --> 03:06.211
I don't want that now.

03:06.213 --> 03:08.781
I just need the guy
to understand the right thing.

03:08.783 --> 03:11.550
He just needs to play
for the team's all.

03:11.552 --> 03:13.151
One more thing.

03:13.153 --> 03:14.789
No guns.

03:16.558 --> 03:17.856
What?

03:17.858 --> 03:19.192
I don't want someone
getting shot

03:19.194 --> 03:21.860
over someone's bullshit nerves.

03:21.862 --> 03:24.062
Remember that trucker last year?

03:24.064 --> 03:26.598
I'm telling you,
and I'm telling Angelo.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.770
Don't let me find out
you went in packing.

03:30.105 --> 03:32.739
- The guy going to be there?
- He will.

03:32.741 --> 03:35.641
I'm sending him a care package.

03:35.643 --> 03:38.711
You, uh, tell that doctor
about your chest?

03:38.713 --> 03:41.548
He... He said it was nothing.

03:41.550 --> 03:43.919
Well, that's excellent news.

03:47.755 --> 03:49.724
Everything's fine, then?

03:54.328 --> 03:55.998
It's fine with me.

05:06.967 --> 05:10.236
Did you see the boss
with your girl?

05:10.238 --> 05:11.638
Yeah.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.342
Why is she with him?

05:14.308 --> 05:16.308
She's a slut.

05:16.310 --> 05:18.344
Don't say that.

05:18.346 --> 05:20.212
I don't need to talk
about her like that.

05:20.214 --> 05:22.948
Then don't talk to me about her.

05:22.950 --> 05:24.218
Let's go.

05:37.231 --> 05:40.301
I don't know how
she could go from you to Ptitko.

05:41.702 --> 05:44.039
If she knew some
of the shit he's done...

05:45.373 --> 05:46.839
You gonna tell her?

05:46.841 --> 05:48.978
She knows
exactly what she's doing.

06:03.157 --> 06:05.424
You take the front.
I'll take the back.

06:05.426 --> 06:08.630
Fuck's sake,
it's one goddamn lawyer.

08:12.854 --> 08:14.520
We have to move.

08:14.522 --> 08:16.589
Come on.
We have to get out of here.

08:16.591 --> 08:18.794
Move! Move!

08:45.920 --> 08:47.486
Are you gonna kill me?

08:47.488 --> 08:49.925
No. Get out.

09:34.035 --> 09:36.305
Can I have a shirt?

09:37.405 --> 09:39.071
Wait here.

10:36.964 --> 10:38.499
Why'd those men
want to kill you?

10:39.334 --> 10:43.501
Well, seems like
some kind of setup,

10:43.503 --> 10:46.374
some bullshit over a woman.

10:48.575 --> 10:51.079
How'd you find yourself
there tonight?

10:53.348 --> 10:55.918
I's from Orange, Texas.

10:59.653 --> 11:01.289
I knew this girl.

11:06.227 --> 11:07.262
What?

11:09.730 --> 11:11.597
Vonda.

11:11.599 --> 11:14.235
She told me
she worked for herself.

11:15.003 --> 11:17.703
I didn't really know
anything about that stuff,

11:17.705 --> 11:21.374
so it was in the phone book.

11:21.376 --> 11:23.074
Perfect Choice Escorts.

11:23.076 --> 11:25.479
It was like a real business
in the phone book.

11:28.315 --> 11:29.618
I didn't know.

11:30.384 --> 11:32.517
One of the owners
of that real business

11:32.519 --> 11:35.321
is a guy by the name
of Stan Ptitko.

11:35.323 --> 11:37.423
You ever meet him?

11:37.425 --> 11:40.291
No.
Maybe I heard the name.

11:40.293 --> 11:41.729
Who's that?

11:42.662 --> 11:45.499
He's the guy that tried
to have me killed tonight.

11:46.666 --> 11:52.405
These three guys came in
and just kept hitting this guy

11:52.407 --> 11:54.642
until he showed him
where something was.

11:56.076 --> 11:57.411
And then they shot him.

11:58.345 --> 12:02.683
They made me wait,
told me I was next.

12:05.219 --> 12:09.690
So fucking happy
you killed them.

12:19.733 --> 12:21.503
So we got away?

12:22.369 --> 12:25.304
It may take a while for them
to figure out what happened,

12:25.306 --> 12:28.073
but they can't let us go.

12:28.075 --> 12:31.142
That guy Stan Ptitko,
he don't want any noise.

12:31.144 --> 12:32.678
The only thing we can do now

12:32.680 --> 12:34.447
is get as far out of town
as possible

12:34.449 --> 12:36.281
and then find a place
to lay low.

12:36.283 --> 12:39.553
After that, I don't know.

12:43.557 --> 12:45.124
I really want a drink.

12:45.126 --> 12:47.425
I kind of want several.

12:47.427 --> 12:49.597
Like a whole pitcher
of single malt.

12:51.565 --> 12:54.600
Starting to feel
like I never needed a drink

12:54.602 --> 12:56.471
as bad in my life.

13:01.876 --> 13:03.612
Well, you're young yet.

13:14.488 --> 13:17.224
Maybe I can just tag along
with you a while.

13:19.160 --> 13:22.595
Drop you in Orange.
You can go back to your family.

13:22.597 --> 13:26.432
Mnh-mnh, no.
I ain't going back there.

13:26.434 --> 13:28.370
You can just
leave me right here.

13:29.402 --> 13:31.569
How much money do you have?

13:31.571 --> 13:32.740
None.

13:34.709 --> 13:37.308
I don't want your money.

13:37.310 --> 13:40.315
I had my own money
in New Orleans.

13:41.349 --> 13:43.781
You're the one who kidnapped me.
I don't even know your name.

13:43.783 --> 13:46.220
I saved you.
Be clear on that.

13:52.325 --> 13:54.860
Cheer up.
You're alive.

13:54.862 --> 13:56.198
I'm buying.

13:59.633 --> 14:00.734
I'm Roy.

14:14.382 --> 14:16.281
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

14:16.283 --> 14:17.482
- How you doing?
- What's your name?

14:17.484 --> 14:19.351
- Davey.
- I'm Rocky.

14:19.353 --> 14:21.220
- Rocky, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

14:26.594 --> 14:27.595
Whiskey.

14:37.205 --> 14:42.540
Roy, this is Curtis and Davey,
and Curtis does rodeo.

14:42.542 --> 14:44.577
Hey.
Y'all want to play some pool?

14:50.685 --> 14:52.253
What's your problem?

14:53.421 --> 14:56.624
You understand we're not
trying to meet people here?

15:00.594 --> 15:03.962
I don't like it, but all
my money's back in the city.

15:03.964 --> 15:05.432
What are you doing?

15:06.367 --> 15:07.933
Cut the baby-doll shit.

15:13.807 --> 15:16.875
Look, I'm offering you
something here.

15:16.877 --> 15:21.813
I'm saying,
you be straight with me,

15:21.815 --> 15:23.749
and I'll be straight with you.

15:27.555 --> 15:31.624
Deal.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.661
Another round.

15:37.397 --> 15:40.332
You shouldn't walk around
so angry all the time.

15:40.334 --> 15:42.237
You'll give yourself
a heart attack.

15:43.470 --> 15:44.738
Can I have one?

15:47.474 --> 15:49.377
You want whiskey?

15:52.747 --> 15:56.914
Thank you.

15:56.916 --> 15:58.916
Cheers.

16:11.732 --> 16:13.866
Stay in a place up the road.

16:13.868 --> 16:15.837
As long as there's a bed.

16:17.371 --> 16:20.942
We can do whatever you want,
no charge.

16:28.648 --> 16:30.251
You're disgusting.

16:50.104 --> 16:51.703
<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>

16:51.705 --> 16:54.472
<i>Oh, my... What a pass!</i>

16:58.445 --> 17:00.679
<i>Sideline left, in bounds.
Looking.</i>

17:00.681 --> 17:02.747
<i>Gets it full.
A dribble to the key.</i>

17:02.749 --> 17:03.881
<i>Stop and pull up.
No!</i>

17:03.883 --> 17:06.584
<i>Rebound, reverse... Sam Jones!</i>

17:06.586 --> 17:09.688
<i>Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness!</i>

17:09.690 --> 17:11.390
<i>What a jam!</i>

17:11.392 --> 17:13.791
<i>A reverse follow.</i>

17:13.794 --> 17:17.628
<i>Sam has tied the game at 100!</i>

18:08.015 --> 18:12.450
<i>If the lucky number matches
the last four digits</i>

18:12.452 --> 18:14.119
<i>of your Mastercard...</i>

18:14.121 --> 18:17.555
<i>...your Visa
or your Discover card,</i>

18:17.557 --> 18:19.891
<i>if it matches
our weekly jackpot,</i>

18:19.893 --> 18:25.063
<i>all you need to do now
is call 1-800-367-9444,</i>

18:25.065 --> 18:29.168
<i>and that will be... that share
of that $25,000 will be yours.</i>

18:29.170 --> 18:31.937
<i>And when that happens,
you could...</i>

18:31.939 --> 18:34.206
<i>If you're sharing in the prize,
if you're sharing the prize,</i>

18:34.208 --> 18:36.041
<i>you could win one
of our grand prizes,</i>

18:36.043 --> 18:37.676
<i>which could be a Mercury Sable.</i>

18:37.678 --> 18:40.144
<i>It could be a, um...</i>

18:46.687 --> 18:47.988
Morning.

18:49.623 --> 18:51.556
What's that?

18:51.558 --> 18:54.059
Old shipping records mostly.

18:54.061 --> 18:55.694
I grabbed them
from the house last night.

18:55.696 --> 18:57.563
It must be what Ptitko is after.

18:57.565 --> 19:00.765
You almost ready?
We got to go get another car.

19:00.767 --> 19:02.467
Start calling me John.

19:02.469 --> 19:04.905
All my new papers say
John Vatrinet.

19:05.905 --> 19:07.906
I'm putting my clothes on now.

19:07.908 --> 19:10.208
I'm not trying nothing.

19:10.210 --> 19:14.082
I got the message
last night, John.

19:15.482 --> 19:16.782
What's that supposed to mean?

19:16.784 --> 19:18.650
What?

19:18.652 --> 19:20.218
You think just because
I don't want to fuck you,

19:20.220 --> 19:21.820
there's something wrong with me?

19:21.822 --> 19:23.690
What? No.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.561
I'm leaving you here.

19:27.594 --> 19:28.826
What?

19:28.828 --> 19:31.563
You're gonna have to
call somebody.

19:31.565 --> 19:33.498
I'll leave you a few bucks.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.867
- Why?
- But I'm...

19:34.869 --> 19:37.803
I'm leaving
I'm leaving you here.

19:37.805 --> 19:39.574
Roy.

19:41.107 --> 19:42.543
Roy, you okay?

19:47.715 --> 19:48.750
What the hell?

19:52.952 --> 19:55.187
Here. Here.

20:05.132 --> 20:07.235
We got to keep moving.

22:47.760 --> 22:51.763
Roy, can you stop
in Orange for me?

22:51.765 --> 22:54.900
- Why?
- I just need to do something.

22:54.902 --> 22:56.638
Now you want to stop?

22:57.738 --> 22:59.740
Somebody owes me money.

23:32.372 --> 23:34.406
Get some money and clothes.

23:34.408 --> 23:36.209
Just give me 10 minutes.

24:30.463 --> 24:32.330
Drive!

24:32.332 --> 24:34.302
Drive! Drive!

24:38.071 --> 24:41.172
- The fuck is this?
- It's my sister, Tiffany.

24:41.174 --> 24:43.809
You can drop us off wherever you
want, but she's coming with me.

24:43.811 --> 24:45.877
- What was that shot?
- He's fine.

24:45.879 --> 24:47.411
- Who's he?
- My stepfather.

24:47.413 --> 24:49.346
I shot a wall.
He got off lucky.

24:49.348 --> 24:51.483
- This is kidnapping.
- It is not.

24:51.485 --> 24:53.017
I'm gonna take care of her now.

24:53.019 --> 24:54.419
She's gonna have a better life.

24:54.421 --> 24:55.920
There's people looking for us.

24:55.922 --> 24:57.088
Y-Y-You're bringing her
into that.

24:57.090 --> 24:58.092
You think about that.

25:02.395 --> 25:05.130
All right, baby.
We're going on a trip.

25:48.374 --> 25:51.311
Gonna get us off the road
for a bit, let the dust settle.

26:37.223 --> 26:39.993
- Help you?
- Two single, each for a week.

26:41.260 --> 26:42.629
They yours?

26:43.931 --> 26:46.334
Nieces, my sister's.

26:53.673 --> 26:55.910
$387 with tax.

26:59.345 --> 27:01.979
You're a darling little girl.

27:01.981 --> 27:03.715
How old are you?

27:03.717 --> 27:05.887
3 1/2.

27:06.652 --> 27:08.021
Well...

27:10.623 --> 27:15.062
105 and 106, just right outside.

27:16.363 --> 27:19.901
I'm Nancy Covington.
I'm always here.

27:20.499 --> 27:25.736
I'm good friends with lots
of policemen, just so you know.

27:25.738 --> 27:28.142
I mind what goes on
in those rooms.

27:29.675 --> 27:31.244
I appreciate it, Nance.

27:32.479 --> 27:34.345
Good Lord, that's
a beautiful little girl.

27:34.347 --> 27:37.282
You're the cutest thing
I ever did see.

27:37.284 --> 27:39.083
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

27:39.085 --> 27:40.421
Thank you.

27:43.489 --> 27:46.457
Every day,
I hear complaints from you!

27:46.459 --> 27:50.327
Who paid for the room?
Who takes care of the kid?

27:57.536 --> 27:59.039
Here's your shirt back.

28:03.677 --> 28:05.446
Can I have a cigarette?

28:22.094 --> 28:24.464
I've been thinking.
How old are you?

28:25.399 --> 28:27.234
Mm... 40.

28:28.468 --> 28:30.104
I'm 19.

28:31.604 --> 28:35.608
Man, that's nothing, right,
no matter what's happened?

28:36.642 --> 28:40.311
That's right. You got... You got
your whole life ahead of you.

28:40.313 --> 28:44.017
You can start your life over
three, four times if you want.

28:44.817 --> 28:46.720
What were you doing at 19?

28:49.256 --> 28:51.121
Running playback bets
in Louisiana

28:51.123 --> 28:53.126
and Mississippi mostly.

28:54.161 --> 28:56.326
How'd you get into that?

28:56.328 --> 28:57.364
Hmm.

29:04.671 --> 29:07.341
Think I really kind of
fucked things up.

29:08.441 --> 29:10.777
You don't need to
think about it that way.

29:12.679 --> 29:15.112
I grew up in Orange.

29:15.114 --> 29:17.450
Nothing changed out there.

29:22.756 --> 29:25.756
Hot, same fields, same grass.

29:25.758 --> 29:28.595
Nothing to do day after day.

29:31.398 --> 29:34.334
I just kept thinking
I wanted a real life.

29:40.873 --> 29:43.277
You want to leave, it's okay.

29:49.415 --> 29:50.450
Get some sleep.

29:52.419 --> 29:54.155
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

30:45.604 --> 30:48.808
I had a nightmare.
Can I stay with you?

31:55.874 --> 31:56.943
What?

32:09.556 --> 32:11.022
Hot one over here.

32:11.024 --> 32:13.358
The one on the grill
or the one standing?

32:14.893 --> 32:17.361
No word on the Kestrel.
I just found out.

32:17.363 --> 32:18.431
So that's a bust.

32:19.999 --> 32:21.632
I don't know what that is.

32:21.634 --> 32:23.034
Offshore rig.

32:23.036 --> 32:24.802
Well, we came down here
'cause I was supposed to

32:24.804 --> 32:26.470
get work on one
for City Service.

32:26.472 --> 32:27.938
Mama said she's hungry.

32:27.940 --> 32:29.573
She don't need no sausage.

32:29.575 --> 32:31.545
You tell her I said so.

32:32.879 --> 32:35.947
Well, I get down here, and they
say they never hired me.

32:37.984 --> 32:39.851
I tell them I got a letter.

32:39.853 --> 32:42.986
Well, they tell me the letter
don't say what it says,

32:42.988 --> 32:44.758
and I'm holding the letter.

32:47.294 --> 32:48.796
You got another?

32:58.505 --> 33:00.641
You know, she's never
been to the ocean.

33:28.802 --> 33:30.571
Aah!

34:20.687 --> 34:21.955
Thank you.

35:45.471 --> 35:47.073
Hey, brother.
Want a cold one?

36:00.185 --> 36:03.221
I got a long-term deal here,
kind of come and go as I please.

36:03.223 --> 36:05.659
I seen a lot of crazy shit
but never a murder.

36:08.895 --> 36:11.027
One of the kids finally said
something to the owner.

36:11.029 --> 36:13.566
I guess he did it to her
earlier in the day.

36:14.933 --> 36:16.669
Where'd you do your time, bro?

36:20.573 --> 36:22.272
Them girls your nieces?

36:22.274 --> 36:24.609
Yeah.
Yeah, we're on vacation.

36:24.611 --> 36:28.578
Cool. Listen, I was...
I was wantin' to talk to you.

36:28.580 --> 36:30.815
I was... I was wondering if
you're looking for work at all

36:30.817 --> 36:33.183
while you're, you know,
on vacation.

36:33.185 --> 36:34.919
Yeah, what you got, kid?

36:34.921 --> 36:37.024
Got like $20,000, man.

36:39.692 --> 36:41.525
There's a guy runs a clinic
on Broadway.

36:41.527 --> 36:43.964
Place is a drug jug.
I know the cleaning lady.

36:45.265 --> 36:47.632
What?
You take down doctors?

36:47.634 --> 36:50.604
I am a thief,
and I'm a real, real good one.

36:51.937 --> 36:54.038
This guy has a sampler pharmacy
on the premises.

36:54.040 --> 36:57.574
I'm talking now benzies, dixies,
biphetamine, amphetamine.

36:57.576 --> 36:59.676
My maid, she fronted me
Polaroids of the layout.

36:59.678 --> 37:01.245
Three days for us to move it
in Corpus and Houston.

37:01.247 --> 37:03.881
$20,000 might be
low-balling it, even.

37:03.883 --> 37:05.583
What do you need me for?

37:05.585 --> 37:07.551
I need somebody to front a van,
help me move it.

37:07.553 --> 37:09.152
I got all the clients,
but, you know,

37:09.154 --> 37:11.691
people wanting product are,
more or less, scum of the earth.

37:12.325 --> 37:14.257
Someone like you at the table
when the deal goes down,

37:14.259 --> 37:15.761
things go smoother.

37:19.031 --> 37:21.766
You seem like a good kid,
but you got the wrong idea.

37:21.768 --> 37:25.201
We're just down
for some sun and waves.

37:25.203 --> 37:26.703
You could take care
of them girls a lot better

37:26.705 --> 37:27.707
with this score.

37:28.741 --> 37:30.710
You don't need 10 grand, man?

37:32.245 --> 37:33.846
Not where I'm going.

37:35.180 --> 37:36.816
Thanks for the beer.

38:13.919 --> 38:15.353
Who is this?

38:15.355 --> 38:17.254
You know who this is,
you son of a bitch.

38:17.256 --> 38:19.857
You took pictures of my lungs.

38:19.859 --> 38:21.091
Yes. I remember, Mr. Cade.

38:21.093 --> 38:23.027
How long do I have?

38:23.029 --> 38:24.328
I can't say. I just...

38:24.330 --> 38:25.830
How long?

38:25.832 --> 38:27.397
You need to come back in.

38:27.399 --> 38:29.699
We need... Roy, you didn't...
We need to do a biopsy.

38:29.701 --> 38:30.967
You just left, and we...

38:30.969 --> 38:32.803
You sawbone quack motherfucker.

38:32.805 --> 38:34.371
You want me to come back in?

38:34.373 --> 38:36.339
I'll come back in, see about
getting a straight answer.

38:36.341 --> 38:38.643
- Roy.
- I got the address.

38:38.645 --> 38:40.076
It's right here.

38:40.078 --> 38:41.678
Wait just a minute.
You got...

38:41.680 --> 38:44.382
2341 Royale.

38:44.384 --> 38:46.016
How did you get that address?

38:46.018 --> 38:48.719
You can't just call here
at this hour of the night.

38:48.721 --> 38:51.821
Your wife know
about the gambling? Hmm?

38:51.823 --> 38:53.391
My wife?
What are you talking about it?

38:53.393 --> 38:56.960
She know how deep in
you are with Ptitko,

38:56.962 --> 38:58.862
you degenerate prick?

38:58.864 --> 39:01.301
I'll come pay you
a fucking visit.

39:29.027 --> 39:30.663
Oh!

39:33.366 --> 39:35.065
It's okay.
It's okay.

39:39.872 --> 39:40.906
Hi, there.

39:42.308 --> 39:43.440
Hi.

39:43.442 --> 39:45.176
Good dive.

39:45.178 --> 39:46.342
Thank you.

39:46.344 --> 39:49.149
- What's your name?
- Rocky.

39:50.049 --> 39:51.317
You on vacation?

39:52.451 --> 39:53.886
Mm-hmm.

39:57.422 --> 39:58.859
Where y'all coming from?

40:01.026 --> 40:04.194
We's from Orange, Texas.

40:04.196 --> 40:05.929
Your Uncle John from there, too?

40:05.931 --> 40:07.330
I got it, baby.

40:07.332 --> 40:08.367
No.

40:18.143 --> 40:20.176
<i>I think watching
a game in the dark,</i>

40:20.178 --> 40:23.413
<i>you lose all sense of time,
so to speak.</i>

40:26.886 --> 40:28.853
<i>Well, they always use
the backup system anyways.</i>

40:28.855 --> 40:31.054
<i>The stopwatches down
in the timekeeper's tent</i>

40:31.056 --> 40:32.989
<i>just in case
something does happen</i>

40:32.991 --> 40:34.158
<i>during the course
of the period.</i>

40:34.160 --> 40:36.926
<i>What we'll probably see...</i>

40:36.928 --> 40:38.828
<i>And just use the stopwatch...</i>

41:38.591 --> 41:41.324
You can do it so good!

41:41.326 --> 41:44.527
I can do it myself.

41:44.529 --> 41:46.198
You can.

41:56.142 --> 41:58.107
No, no, nothing like that.

41:58.109 --> 42:03.282
Just... Just leaving Galveston,
remembered you were close.

42:04.183 --> 42:10.087
No, I-I was on a welding job
out on... on a rig.

42:10.089 --> 42:11.491
It's over now.

42:16.294 --> 42:19.231
No, I don't...
I don't want nothing.

43:31.504 --> 43:33.406
Loraine, Loraine.

43:35.140 --> 43:37.241
What do you want?

43:37.243 --> 43:40.109
Talk, catch up a little.

43:40.111 --> 43:42.478
Just passing through.

43:42.480 --> 43:44.584
I told you I was busy.

43:46.285 --> 43:49.185
Okay,
just for a minute, though.

43:49.187 --> 43:51.624
But you come inside here.
I don't want you out front.

43:55.460 --> 43:59.198
Seems you changed your mind
about marriage.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.203
Well, when you meet
the right man...

44:06.504 --> 44:08.339
What are you doing here?

44:08.341 --> 44:11.542
Well, like I said, I was just
passing through, and I-I...

44:11.544 --> 44:17.549
and I was... curious
to hear how you been.

44:18.417 --> 44:22.219
Been? Been since when,
11 years ago?

44:22.221 --> 44:23.356
Yeah.

44:24.723 --> 44:28.661
The last 11 years
have been absolutely wonderful.

44:30.196 --> 44:31.197
There.

44:36.201 --> 44:38.971
You know, you're not as handsome
as I used to think.

44:43.042 --> 44:44.710
Yeah, I actually get that a lot.

44:47.312 --> 44:48.981
You're drunk.

44:53.451 --> 44:56.286
You really can't stick around.
I am busy.

44:56.288 --> 44:57.654
Well, I'm not staying.

44:57.656 --> 45:00.293
I'm going, leaving town.
I was just...

45:01.259 --> 45:04.730
You remember when
we went to Galveston?

45:06.098 --> 45:08.265
You remember that week
when you...

45:08.267 --> 45:12.335
you told me about your sister
and your dad.

45:12.337 --> 45:13.540
Remember?

45:14.806 --> 45:20.444
I was remembering that we were
drunk on mojitos before noon,

45:20.446 --> 45:23.049
and we were just
scarfing crabmeat.

45:24.216 --> 45:28.087
And we cou...
we couldn't get the smell off.

45:28.654 --> 45:31.788
We were showering off,
and it... it rained,

45:31.790 --> 45:34.658
and we went inside,
just stayed inside.

45:34.660 --> 45:37.397
Just two days, just,
you know, fuckin'.

45:38.430 --> 45:40.230
Mm-hmm.

45:40.232 --> 45:42.533
I'm a dynamite piece of ass.

45:42.535 --> 45:45.504
- Yes, you are.
- Hmm. Thank you, Roy.

45:46.739 --> 45:48.772
I can't do this
all day with you.

45:48.774 --> 45:53.480
I'm just leaving t-the country,
and I was thinking, uh...

45:55.848 --> 45:59.552
We... We... I... We...
I believe we had good times.

46:01.120 --> 46:03.355
I was glad
when you went to prison.

46:05.591 --> 46:07.690
Look, the past isn't real.

46:07.692 --> 46:11.464
You... You remember it
how you want to remember it.

46:13.364 --> 46:15.833
You'd sober up for a week,
and then you'd start

46:15.835 --> 46:17.600
talking about how things
are gonna be different,

46:17.602 --> 46:20.339
and then you'd be drunk
for three weeks straight.

46:23.174 --> 46:25.741
You made it so that
I couldn't be around you

46:25.743 --> 46:27.413
without being shit-faced.

46:29.314 --> 46:31.183
And you threw me
around a little.

46:33.218 --> 46:34.653
You remember that?

46:39.859 --> 46:42.261
What'd you ever like
about me, then?

46:44.263 --> 46:45.732
I don't remember.

46:52.303 --> 46:56.276
There haven't been many
like you for me.

47:05.417 --> 47:06.853
You see this here?

47:09.421 --> 47:11.788
It sends an alarm
to all those Hallivan boys

47:11.790 --> 47:13.660
that patrol the neighborhood.

47:18.297 --> 47:20.830
I was just saying goodbye.

47:20.832 --> 47:22.367
Sure you were.

47:26.372 --> 47:27.739
I'm dying.

47:29.774 --> 47:31.243
Aren't we all?

47:58.236 --> 47:59.838
Do you think I look pretty?

48:16.388 --> 48:19.489
It'll only be for
a few hours tonight.

48:19.491 --> 48:22.426
I'll have money
for you tomorrow.

48:22.428 --> 48:24.531
Well, we really do enjoy her.

48:25.263 --> 48:27.364
What are you up to?

48:27.366 --> 48:30.203
How you bringing money back
when you haven't had any here?

48:32.004 --> 48:38.341
Well, I got a job today
at this restaurant on the strip.

48:38.343 --> 48:42.279
I'm a hostess at Scarpetto's.
I get a tip-out.

48:44.482 --> 48:45.951
Yeah, right.

48:47.852 --> 48:49.853
Good for you.

48:49.855 --> 48:52.725
We'll take care of her.
Of course we will.

48:55.560 --> 48:56.828
Thank you.

49:17.049 --> 49:19.451
You're just drunk, baby.

50:36.962 --> 50:39.129
Hello! Hello!

50:39.131 --> 50:40.730
Hello!

50:40.732 --> 50:42.431
Hey. Do you know where, uh...

50:42.433 --> 50:45.102
You know, normally I let folks
keep to themselves,

50:45.104 --> 50:48.437
but after what happened here,
that man murdering his wife,

50:48.439 --> 50:49.806
I got to know what's going on.

50:49.808 --> 50:52.007
That gal of yours,
she had men in her room

50:52.009 --> 50:54.009
twice since you left.

50:54.011 --> 50:57.748
She's been putting that little
baby off on Dee and Nonie,

50:57.750 --> 51:00.449
and I believe
there was some confusion

51:00.451 --> 51:02.786
as to whether you would be back.

51:02.788 --> 51:04.757
Of course I would.
I paid up.

51:05.390 --> 51:06.656
How's the kid?

51:06.658 --> 51:08.928
She deserves better than this.

51:09.861 --> 51:13.663
You know, I don't know if you're
that gal's pimp or not,

51:13.665 --> 51:16.699
but you look like hell,
and you smell like it, too.

51:16.701 --> 51:19.002
Normally, I'd have had you
tossed out of here,

51:19.004 --> 51:23.607
called the sheriff's,
but that little one,

51:23.609 --> 51:25.475
she don't need to be
put in no system.

51:25.477 --> 51:27.978
However bad you think
she has it,

51:27.980 --> 51:29.849
where she's coming from
was worse.

51:30.649 --> 51:34.917
Now, her sister's just a girl
I helped out, bad spot.

51:34.919 --> 51:36.752
Look, I didn't know her
till a few days back.

51:36.754 --> 51:39.890
- She wanted a ride to Texas.
- Who are you?

51:39.892 --> 51:44.094
I'm just a guy who tried
to help out a couple people,

51:44.096 --> 51:45.562
and it's brought me here.

51:46.832 --> 51:48.732
Listen, they're not my problem.

51:48.734 --> 51:51.000
I'll call the sheriff myself,
tell him some hitchhiking tramp

51:51.002 --> 51:52.701
dropped her kid off on me.

51:52.703 --> 51:54.670
I don't think
you're gonna call any sheriff

51:54.672 --> 51:56.540
and say anything,
but I do think

51:56.542 --> 52:00.078
if you were gonna leave
those girls, you would've.

52:10.589 --> 52:12.924
- Ice cream cone.
- Ice cream cone?

52:19.864 --> 52:21.931
I'm looking for the girl.

52:21.933 --> 52:23.468
You seen her?

52:25.904 --> 52:28.103
Saw you leave.

52:28.105 --> 52:31.007
Saw you toss the paper,
dug it out the trash.

52:31.009 --> 52:33.042
I's just reading along,
realized,

52:33.044 --> 52:35.011
hey, them girls in that article

52:35.013 --> 52:37.513
got the same name
as these girls here.

52:37.515 --> 52:39.651
One plus one, you know?

52:40.585 --> 52:42.118
Ain't none of my business, man.

52:42.120 --> 52:43.886
I ain't got no desire
to screw you over or nothing.

52:43.888 --> 52:46.589
I'm just saying, you know,
if it come to that.

52:46.591 --> 52:48.491
Come to what?

52:48.493 --> 52:50.060
Listen, if I don't have
a partner for that score,

52:50.062 --> 52:51.962
I could get busted.

52:51.964 --> 52:54.730
Cops come down on me hard,
I could break easy.

52:54.732 --> 52:57.801
But I could say, "Listen,
y'all lend me some grace,

52:57.803 --> 52:59.439
and I can give you a murder.

53:00.739 --> 53:03.009
I can tell you something
about some missing girls."

53:05.042 --> 53:07.109
I ain't a rat.
I'm just... I'm just saying.

53:07.111 --> 53:10.045
Let's make some money, man,
you know?

53:10.047 --> 53:11.882
Just come check out
the place with me.

53:11.884 --> 53:13.984
I'll lay it all out for you,
and you'll see I'm a pro, man.

53:13.986 --> 53:15.221
I'm a pro.

53:19.957 --> 53:21.193
All right.

53:22.727 --> 53:24.663
I want to wait till dark,
though.

53:25.564 --> 53:27.696
People around here probably
shouldn't see us hanging out,

53:27.698 --> 53:31.770
so meet me in the parking lot
down by the Zippy Trip, 8:00.

53:33.138 --> 53:34.870
You're paranoid, brah.

53:34.872 --> 53:36.705
Ain't nobody here
gonna know anything.

53:36.707 --> 53:39.144
You want me in, we're gonna
start being careful right now.

54:41.105 --> 54:43.575
It's not far,
just down Broadway.

54:49.848 --> 54:51.915
I'm really glad
you changed your mind, bro.

54:51.917 --> 54:53.986
You're gonna see.
I'm a real pro.

55:11.268 --> 55:13.104
On the next block up.

57:19.897 --> 57:22.431
No! Ah!

57:22.433 --> 57:24.433
You start whoring
the second I'm gone?

57:24.435 --> 57:26.201
You were gone!

57:26.203 --> 57:27.437
Hmm?

57:29.540 --> 57:31.241
Pick up your fucking head!

57:31.243 --> 57:33.375
That woman talking about
calling social services,

57:33.377 --> 57:35.310
saying some whore
abandoned her sister.

57:35.312 --> 57:37.846
You fucking killed someone!

57:37.848 --> 57:40.984
<i>- You</i> killed someone.
- We are not the same.

57:40.986 --> 57:43.786
Yes, we are.

57:51.328 --> 57:53.998
Roy, you okay?

57:54.899 --> 57:56.301
You okay?

58:02.540 --> 58:04.375
Roy? Roy?

58:06.444 --> 58:08.877
Roy, should I call a doctor?

58:25.964 --> 58:27.032
Roy.

58:28.332 --> 58:32.937
Roy, back in Orange...

58:34.105 --> 58:37.176
I don't doubt he deserved it.

58:37.908 --> 58:42.881
I mean, she's not
your sister, is she?

58:54.024 --> 58:55.160
No.

59:01.600 --> 59:04.370
You want... want to tell me
about him?

59:09.975 --> 59:12.542
My mom wasn't around,

59:12.544 --> 59:15.580
and so it was just Gary and I.

59:16.448 --> 59:21.053
And he moved the... t-the TV
in my room for me.

59:22.620 --> 59:24.589
And he was drinking whiskey.

59:27.125 --> 59:31.463
So he sat in my room with me...

59:32.631 --> 59:34.899
...watching the TV.

59:37.234 --> 59:38.303
And then he...

59:46.977 --> 59:49.147
And I left her.

59:51.082 --> 59:53.551
I left her.

59:55.252 --> 59:57.620
I left her.

59:57.622 --> 01:00:00.323
I-I left her.

01:00:00.325 --> 01:00:02.060
I left her with him.

01:00:04.361 --> 01:00:05.497
Well...

01:00:07.564 --> 01:00:08.633
It's all right.

01:00:11.402 --> 01:00:12.571
Forget it.

01:00:14.105 --> 01:00:16.075
That's over now.

01:00:20.578 --> 01:00:24.650
I'm gonna square with Nancy.
We can't stay here no more.

01:00:26.151 --> 01:00:27.518
Roy.

01:00:30.355 --> 01:00:32.157
Don't leave us.

01:00:34.426 --> 01:00:35.628
I won't.

01:00:39.397 --> 01:00:40.532
Okay.

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:01.551
- Surprise, surprise!
- Damn, Roy.

01:01:01.553 --> 01:01:04.020
I wondered if we'd
hear from you again.

01:01:04.022 --> 01:01:07.589
That was some show you put on.
Cost me three good men.

01:01:07.591 --> 01:01:09.524
I was actually impressed.

01:01:09.526 --> 01:01:11.627
Yeah, well, I got something.

01:01:11.629 --> 01:01:15.230
Cargo manifests,
your name everywhere.

01:01:15.232 --> 01:01:17.567
And real long,
real detailed letter

01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:19.569
explaining the whole operation.

01:01:19.571 --> 01:01:22.138
- On my eyes...
- On your eyes, then,

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:24.140
you carpetbagging
Pollock motherfucker!

01:01:24.142 --> 01:01:25.607
This is what your boys
were after?

01:01:25.609 --> 01:01:27.743
- Yeah? Well, I got it.
- What you want?

01:01:27.745 --> 01:01:31.446
75K deposited.
It's a bargain.

01:01:31.448 --> 01:01:33.082
I think it's a bit much.

01:01:33.084 --> 01:01:36.152
Copies go out. <i>Times-Picayune.</i>
Baton Rouge.

01:01:36.154 --> 01:01:37.420
Originals to the feds.

01:01:37.422 --> 01:01:39.355
"Ptitko," it says,
nearly every page.

01:01:39.357 --> 01:01:41.491
"Ptitko, Ptitko,
Ptitko, Ptitko, Ptitko."

01:01:41.493 --> 01:01:43.058
Get a pen 'cause
I'm about to hang up.

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:44.794
What assurances do I have?

01:01:44.796 --> 01:01:46.261
Guess you're gonna
have to reckon

01:01:46.263 --> 01:01:48.533
my word's a little better
than yours.

01:01:49.401 --> 01:01:50.736
This buys me out.

01:01:52.469 --> 01:01:53.705
I'm done.

01:01:59.044 --> 01:02:02.045
Appreciate how y'all have
taken to the little one.

01:02:02.047 --> 01:02:03.812
She's very special.

01:02:03.814 --> 01:02:08.019
May be the case they end up
sticking around after I leave.

01:02:10.154 --> 01:02:12.423
They need people
to be nice to them.

01:02:13.223 --> 01:02:17.359
That little one needs people
looking out for her.

01:02:17.361 --> 01:02:18.497
What do you mean?

01:02:19.397 --> 01:02:22.397
I mean, if I wasn't around

01:02:22.399 --> 01:02:26.069
and the little one
needed something,

01:02:26.071 --> 01:02:28.507
I know you'd look after her.

01:02:39.616 --> 01:02:41.053
You want to try?

01:02:50.395 --> 01:02:56.866
Well, I just figured I could
take you out tonight

01:02:56.868 --> 01:02:59.605
and get dinner or something.

01:03:04.442 --> 01:03:05.774
Sure.

01:03:05.776 --> 01:03:08.143
Sounds good.

01:03:08.145 --> 01:03:09.580
All right.

01:03:12.517 --> 01:03:14.652
All right.
Well, I'll pick you up at 5:00?

01:03:15.786 --> 01:03:17.122
All right.

01:03:21.558 --> 01:03:22.727
Yeah.

01:03:56.928 --> 01:04:00.830
Don't... Don't get too excited,
but I got something going on

01:04:00.832 --> 01:04:02.598
that could help you out
a little bit,

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:04.803
get you some... some money.

01:04:08.872 --> 01:04:13.275
You take yourself
a high-school-degree test.

01:04:13.277 --> 01:04:15.210
I'm serious.
You...

01:04:15.212 --> 01:04:17.312
You take yourself
a high-school-degree test.

01:04:17.314 --> 01:04:19.281
You help... Y-You hire somebody

01:04:19.283 --> 01:04:20.649
to help you out
with the little one,

01:04:20.651 --> 01:04:22.384
and... and you go to school
for something.

01:04:22.386 --> 01:04:23.719
For what?

01:04:23.721 --> 01:04:26.254
Learn to do something.
You're quick.

01:04:26.256 --> 01:04:28.424
You do it for yourself.
You do it for her.

01:04:28.426 --> 01:04:31.330
You just do it.
Give the two of you a life.

01:07:56.634 --> 01:07:58.933
Like her mom,
taking after her mom.

01:07:58.935 --> 01:08:01.103
- My hair's up... now.
- Yeah.

01:08:01.105 --> 01:08:02.138
- Now.
- My hair's up.

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:04.440
- Yeah.
- I like it.

01:08:04.442 --> 01:08:05.708
What was the game
she was playing?

01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:06.775
I spy.

01:08:06.777 --> 01:08:08.978
I spy with my little eye.

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:13.649
- Something...
- She always looks at the thing.

01:08:13.651 --> 01:08:15.418
- And you...
- And so I know.

01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:17.419
But she gets sad
'cause I always get it.

01:08:28.497 --> 01:08:29.531
Roy!

01:08:29.533 --> 01:08:30.966
Rocky!

01:08:30.968 --> 01:08:32.903
Roy!

01:08:34.071 --> 01:08:36.069
- Rocky!
- Roy!

01:08:36.072 --> 01:08:37.471
Rocky!

01:08:37.474 --> 01:08:38.140
Roy!

01:08:38.142 --> 01:08:39.908
Aah!

01:08:48.653 --> 01:08:50.585
Same old Roy.

01:08:50.587 --> 01:08:53.054
You just couldn't
help yourself, could you?

01:08:53.055 --> 01:08:56.859
Calling me up,
making demands, even.

01:08:56.861 --> 01:08:58.694
It's too bad
you weren't as careful

01:08:58.696 --> 01:09:00.529
when you called the doctor.

01:09:00.531 --> 01:09:04.435
Remember?
He came to me scared shitless.

01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:11.408
That little whore of yours
put up a hell of a fight.

01:09:49.179 --> 01:09:50.514
Roy?

01:09:51.883 --> 01:09:52.951
Roy?

01:09:54.885 --> 01:09:56.620
Roy?

01:10:11.836 --> 01:10:13.168
Hey, shh!

01:10:13.170 --> 01:10:15.905
Roy, Roy, they're coming back.

01:10:15.907 --> 01:10:17.606
They're coming back.

01:10:17.608 --> 01:10:20.042
Stand up.
Stand up.

01:10:20.044 --> 01:10:21.276
You have to go now.

01:10:21.278 --> 01:10:23.678
Okay. Take that.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.981
Please go. Go.

01:10:25.983 --> 01:10:28.553
Go. Go.

01:11:23.773 --> 01:11:25.142
Oh.

01:11:34.919 --> 01:11:36.054
No.

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:58.707
Come on.

01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:59.810
No.

01:12:01.879 --> 01:12:03.314
Come on.

01:15:58.916 --> 01:16:00.548
Ah! Ugh!

01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:09.951
We took a look at your lungs.

01:17:09.953 --> 01:17:12.286
I suspect aspergillosis.

01:17:12.288 --> 01:17:14.289
We'll do a biopsy to confirm,

01:17:14.291 --> 01:17:16.325
but this is not
life-threatening.

01:17:16.327 --> 01:17:17.562
No.

01:17:18.495 --> 01:17:22.664
Mr. Cady,
there are treatment options,

01:17:22.666 --> 01:17:24.569
and the state will pay.

01:17:31.642 --> 01:17:33.408
Mr. Cady,
I am speaking to you now

01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:36.043
as outside counsel
for an unnamed party

01:17:36.045 --> 01:17:38.282
concerned with
your recent felonies.

01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:43.086
Assault, theft, homicide.

01:17:43.754 --> 01:17:46.288
Quite a list of charges,
Mr. Cady.

01:17:46.290 --> 01:17:50.191
Though I understand you intend
to indict other persons

01:17:50.193 --> 01:17:52.162
to avoid serving time.

01:17:53.197 --> 01:17:56.464
In other words, you're planning
to make it easy on yourself

01:17:56.466 --> 01:17:59.002
by informing on my client.

01:18:01.772 --> 01:18:03.472
Naturally, my client's defense

01:18:03.474 --> 01:18:07.743
would include a body
of witnesses to cross-examine,

01:18:07.745 --> 01:18:11.713
such as Nancy Covington,

01:18:11.715 --> 01:18:15.553
owner of the Emerald Shores
Motel in Galveston, Texas.

01:18:16.653 --> 01:18:20.756
And a young child,
3-year-old girl.

01:18:20.758 --> 01:18:24.759
Name I have here
is Tiffany Benoit,

01:18:24.761 --> 01:18:27.596
currently residing with
Nonie and Dehra Ellison

01:18:27.598 --> 01:18:32.100
at 540 Briarwood Lane,
Round Rock, Texas.

01:18:32.102 --> 01:18:34.037
That's correct, isn't it?

01:18:38.308 --> 01:18:42.043
Well, there's no need
to involve them, of course,

01:18:42.045 --> 01:18:44.279
if you just serve
your time quietly

01:18:44.281 --> 01:18:46.448
and leave my client out of it.

01:20:28.152 --> 01:20:29.750
<i>Now, including
this information,</i>

01:20:29.752 --> 01:20:31.919
<i>this storm is becoming
quite large.</i>

01:20:31.921 --> 01:20:33.722
<i>This is gonna be
a major hurricane.</i>

01:20:33.724 --> 01:20:37.258
<i>Could be a Category 3 or a 4
by landfall.</i>

01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:39.793
<i>Truly massive storm,
appears to be.</i>

01:20:39.795 --> 01:20:42.429
<i>But right now, as you can see,
it really seems to be</i>

01:20:42.431 --> 01:20:44.365
<i>splitting the difference
on the Hurricane Center.</i>

01:20:44.367 --> 01:20:48.235
<i>Most likely to make landfall
on the Gulf Coast of Texas,</i>

01:20:48.237 --> 01:20:51.940
<i>hitting somewhere between
Corpus Christi and Galveston.</i>

01:20:51.942 --> 01:20:56.511
<i>This is taking up around
a half of the Gulf of Mexico.</i>

01:20:56.513 --> 01:20:59.548
<i>This storm could be
more Allen-like in power.</i>

01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:02.383
<i>You just can't say,
but we've really got to listen</i>

01:21:02.385 --> 01:21:04.552
<i>to what the mayor
and county judge said.</i>

01:21:04.554 --> 01:21:06.454
<i>When you're dealing
with a storm of this size,</i>

01:21:06.456 --> 01:21:08.757
<i>really, Category 4 hurricane...</i>

01:21:08.759 --> 01:21:11.192
<i>...storm surges 13 to 18 feet,</i>

01:21:11.194 --> 01:21:13.962
<i>winds 131 to 155 miles per hour.</i>

01:21:17.901 --> 01:21:20.238
Hi.
I'm looking for Roy.

01:21:20.836 --> 01:21:22.837
<i>Don't take this storm
for granted.</i>

01:21:22.839 --> 01:21:24.142
<i>We are dealing with...</i>

01:21:28.978 --> 01:21:30.881
How did you find me?

01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:36.720
Oh, it was the lady
from the hotel a long time ago.

01:21:37.821 --> 01:21:40.390
She, uh, said
your real name was Roy.

01:21:43.594 --> 01:21:46.962
I hired a man who found
your prison records and photos.

01:21:46.964 --> 01:21:50.231
Took him a while, though.
You don't look the same.

01:21:51.602 --> 01:21:53.938
It's 20 years ago.

01:21:55.772 --> 01:21:57.705
Where do you live?

01:21:57.707 --> 01:21:58.709
Austin.

01:21:59.408 --> 01:22:00.842
What do you do there?

01:22:00.844 --> 01:22:04.846
Uh, I do graphic design
and advertisement stuff,

01:22:04.848 --> 01:22:06.783
but I'm an artist, too.

01:22:09.519 --> 01:22:10.788
You married?

01:22:13.389 --> 01:22:14.424
Not yet.

01:22:15.826 --> 01:22:17.361
Maybe soon.

01:22:17.995 --> 01:22:19.529
You in love?

01:22:28.337 --> 01:22:30.241
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:22:30.873 --> 01:22:34.312
That's good,
that you're in love.

01:22:34.877 --> 01:22:36.214
Yeah.

01:22:40.584 --> 01:22:44.621
He's the one
who encouraged me to...

01:22:46.889 --> 01:22:48.392
I'm sorry.

01:22:48.959 --> 01:22:53.828
I spent a lot of time
and money to find you,

01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:55.800
and I have questions.

01:22:57.466 --> 01:23:01.605
Uh, how much do you...
how much do you know?

01:23:06.710 --> 01:23:08.379
I remember my sister.

01:23:10.313 --> 01:23:12.015
A little.

01:23:12.748 --> 01:23:16.286
I remember us
going to the beach.

01:23:19.656 --> 01:23:22.356
But then, one day,
she just left me.

01:23:22.358 --> 01:23:25.093
No, uh, wasn't like that.

01:23:25.095 --> 01:23:27.661
We... We were going out
for the night,

01:23:27.663 --> 01:23:30.533
and we were coming
right back for you.

01:23:31.702 --> 01:23:33.735
But then you were
in New Orleans.

01:23:33.737 --> 01:23:37.438
- You were in prison?
- Yeah, uh, I was in a...

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.542
a car accident and...

01:23:41.478 --> 01:23:43.110
...got banged up.

01:23:43.112 --> 01:23:46.483
And there was a warrant
out on me.

01:23:47.451 --> 01:23:49.817
I don't... I don't understand
what happened

01:23:49.819 --> 01:23:51.621
after you both left me.

01:23:58.627 --> 01:24:00.398
Why won't you answer me?

01:24:01.364 --> 01:24:03.932
Stop putting me off.
Stop lying to me.

01:24:03.934 --> 01:24:06.003
I just... I need to know.

01:24:07.136 --> 01:24:08.706
Please.

01:24:13.143 --> 01:24:14.645
You know, all this...

01:24:16.947 --> 01:24:23.354
All this time,
uh, I was your friend.

01:24:26.723 --> 01:24:30.493
I'll tell you everything
that happened.

01:24:31.761 --> 01:24:33.994
But I-I got a condition.

01:24:33.996 --> 01:24:37.531
Uh, there's a...
there's a storm coming,

01:24:37.533 --> 01:24:39.100
and you got to get out of town.

01:24:39.102 --> 01:24:40.502
What about you?
Let's go now.

01:24:40.504 --> 01:24:41.735
- You can come with me.
- No.

01:24:41.737 --> 01:24:42.939
No.

01:24:43.773 --> 01:24:45.774
I'll talk to you now.

01:24:45.776 --> 01:24:49.380
And if I talk, you leave.

01:24:51.947 --> 01:24:53.350
That's the deal.

01:25:01.825 --> 01:25:02.825
Deal.

01:25:05.895 --> 01:25:10.934
That other little girl
in the picture...

01:25:12.469 --> 01:25:14.038
...uh, she isn't your sister.

01:25:15.738 --> 01:25:17.107
She's your mother.

01:25:25.614 --> 01:25:28.883
Don't blame her.
She had a hard life.

01:25:28.885 --> 01:25:31.555
But she did a brave thing once.

01:25:33.622 --> 01:25:35.125
She didn't leave you.

01:25:39.662 --> 01:25:41.898
You weren't abandoned.

01:25:49.906 --> 01:25:52.676
Never abandoned.

01:26:13.196 --> 01:26:15.629

01:26:15.631 --> 01:26:17.265

this evening.</i>

01:26:17.267 --> 01:26:20.235

01:26:20.237 --> 01:26:22.637
