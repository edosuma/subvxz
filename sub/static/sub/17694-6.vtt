WEBVTT

00:03.437 --> 00:07.840
(sighs)
So, the people at Buzzfeed

00:07.842 --> 00:12.277
are<i> abuzz</i>
about my article.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.779
I had no idea
you were a writer.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.015
Oh, I don't know dick
about writing,

00:16.017 --> 00:18.717
but "The Top 12 Dog Haircuts
of the '90s" --

00:18.719 --> 00:20.986
I know many dicks' worth
about that.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.955
Hey, there, birthday girl!

00:22.957 --> 00:26.291
Hello, yourself,
Mr. Birthday Girl.

00:26.293 --> 00:30.195
This year I bought you not one,
but 81 birthday presents.

00:30.197 --> 00:33.165
And I'll give you a hint,
it's America's favorite thing.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.134
81 bald eagles?

00:35.136 --> 00:37.703
No, but remember that one
for<i> my</i> birthday.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.005
Happy early birthday,
Stan.

00:40.007 --> 00:43.142
(eagles caw)
(laughs)

00:43.144 --> 00:45.744
(majestic music plays)

00:48.983 --> 00:51.216
(eagle caws)

01:06.867 --> 01:09.401
(moaning)

01:13.174 --> 01:14.673
What happened?

01:14.675 --> 01:17.509
You were about to tell me about
my birthday present,

01:17.511 --> 01:20.112
then made bird noises,
got an erection,

01:20.114 --> 01:22.081
and started tongue-kissing
the air.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.850
Right, like I said, I got you
81 presents --

01:24.852 --> 01:27.419
season tickets to
the Washington Nationals.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.788
But, Stan, I don't even
like baseball.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.958
Oh, your gigantic smile
is thanks enough.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.694
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have somewhere I need to be.

01:35.696 --> 01:39.198
(making whooshing noises)

01:39.200 --> 01:41.100
Now, where were we --

01:41.102 --> 01:44.036
What?! I was gone two minutes
and you invite Hank over?

01:44.038 --> 01:45.871
You've crossed
the wrong guy, Hank!

01:45.873 --> 01:48.440
Ugh! (groans)
I give!

01:48.442 --> 01:50.876
You're so much stronger
than you look, Hank.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.715
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:56.717 --> 02:00.152
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

02:00.154 --> 02:03.088
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

02:03.090 --> 02:06.692
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

02:09.663 --> 02:12.898
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

02:12.900 --> 02:15.134
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:15.136 --> 02:17.936
Aah!

02:17.938 --> 02:20.806
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:23.310 --> 02:25.944
I have everything I need
to enjoy the game --

02:25.946 --> 02:28.180
authentic jersey,
glove for foul balls,

02:28.182 --> 02:30.516
and the lyrics to
"Y'all Ready For This?"

02:30.518 --> 02:33.552
So I don't forget them like a
fool when everyone's singing it.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.990
(sighs)
Wonderful.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.125
Yep, seems like you got
everything you need,

02:40.127 --> 02:41.760
except a happy wife.

02:41.762 --> 02:44.930
Francine likes baseball.
She just doesn't know it yet.

02:44.932 --> 02:47.933
For as long as I can remember,
Francine and I have shared

02:47.935 --> 02:51.036
all the same interests -- Scotch
and cigars with the fellas,

02:51.038 --> 02:53.672
jokin' around with the guys,
poker night with the boys.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.674
Oh, and supercharged
snowmobiles.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.109
With the boys.

02:57.111 --> 02:58.477
It's not safe to ride alone.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.679
Francine doesn't do
any of that stuff.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.814
Don't you see?
You're growing apart.

03:02.816 --> 03:06.451
Or...or...we're growing
even closer together.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.820
Haven't you heard the phrase
"opposites attract"?

03:08.822 --> 03:10.355
Nope.
You -- Really?

03:10.357 --> 03:13.392
Hmm.
I'll need help explaining this.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.060
(knocking at door)

03:15.062 --> 03:18.530
Thanks for coming on such short
notice, MC Skat Kat.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.366
No bigs. We gonna do this?
You know it.

03:21.368 --> 03:25.671
¶ Baby, seems
we never ever agree ¶

03:25.673 --> 03:29.741
¶ You like the movies,
and I like TV ¶

03:29.743 --> 03:32.344
¶ I take things seriously -- ¶
Right. Got it.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.545
I remember this song.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.747
And I remember this cat,
Garfield.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.150
This son of a bitch
hates Mondays.

03:38.152 --> 03:40.719
But opposites don't attract.
People don't work that way.

03:40.721 --> 03:41.720
He's right.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.555
But, Stan, seriously,

03:43.557 --> 03:45.857
have you heard anything about
that janitorial job?

03:45.859 --> 03:47.092
I mean,
I'm barely getting by --

03:47.094 --> 03:48.694
Excellent.
Let's hang out soon.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.862
Damn it.
Okay.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.398
Opposites don't attract,
but samesies do.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.167
What are me and Francine's
samesies?

03:55.169 --> 03:56.568
There's got to be
something we share!

03:56.570 --> 03:57.869
Uh, Stan, he didn't leave.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.438
He just ducked down
in the bushes.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.406
Yeah, how do you think
he got here so fast?

04:06.113 --> 04:08.413
¶ Huge cookie time,
huge cookie time ¶

04:08.415 --> 04:11.617
I call first bite!
I call last bite!

04:11.619 --> 04:13.852
(both blowing)

04:13.854 --> 04:15.520
(doorbell rings)

04:15.522 --> 04:19.424
I got it. Be a doll and keep
blowin' on that thing.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.593
We're looking for
Burt Jarvis.

04:21.595 --> 04:22.861
Nope, not here.
Never heard of him.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.097
Well,
this is his address.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.766
We've sent him letters,
we've called.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.402
If he ever turns up here,
please,

04:30.404 --> 04:32.571
tell him
his people need help.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.206
Everyone's getting sick.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.974
(coughs)

04:35.976 --> 04:38.443
What a story.
If we see him, we'll tell him.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.045
(sighs)
Roger.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.047
What were those sick people
talking about?

04:42.049 --> 04:43.815
What?
Those two broads?

04:43.817 --> 04:46.418
They're clearly hung up on some
guy who's not feeling it.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.786
Huge cookie time!

04:47.788 --> 04:50.656
No, Roger,
it's huge honesty time.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.958
Okay, okay.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.428
My Burt Jarvis persona
ran for -- and won --

04:56.430 --> 04:58.664
a seat in the Nevada
State Legislature.

04:58.666 --> 05:02.000
You see, in Nevada, Senators eat
free at casino buffets,

05:02.002 --> 05:05.637
but it does not include drinks,
so I abandoned the character.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.740
(laughs) You wouldn't believe
all the letters I still get

05:08.742 --> 05:11.410
about "poison water this"
and "poison-water that."

05:11.412 --> 05:13.512
I mean, who even
drinks water anymore?

05:13.514 --> 05:15.280
Grab a Coke Zero,
am I right?

05:15.282 --> 05:17.449
Roger, those people need
Burt jarvis!

05:17.451 --> 05:18.984
We have to help them!

05:18.986 --> 05:21.520
You just want a free trip
to Carson City, don't you?

05:21.522 --> 05:23.989
Carson City.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.958
(flourish)

05:26.960 --> 05:30.295
Wow.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.130
All right, fine.
We can go.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.667
But since you're in
such a hurry...

05:35.669 --> 05:36.968
(gulp)

05:36.970 --> 05:39.271
Ugh!
What happened?

05:39.273 --> 05:41.440
I threw up,
but the cookie blocked it.

05:41.442 --> 05:44.042
I'm getting hit from
every angle here.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.046
Here we are, Francine --
the ballpark.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.349
If you thought parking in
the faraway cheap lot

05:50.351 --> 05:52.851
and maneuvering through gang
violence was thrilling,

05:52.853 --> 05:54.353
just wait until the first pitch!

05:54.355 --> 05:57.322
Whatever, Stan. Can we please
get something to eat?

05:57.324 --> 05:59.725
Of course!
We both share a love of eating!

06:00.794 --> 06:01.960
So, what can I get you?

06:01.962 --> 06:03.362
I'll have
a large spaghetti.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.063
They, uh,
they don't have that.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.799
Okay, I'll have
a medium spaghetti.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.468
Look, how about I get you my
favorite snack --

06:09.470 --> 06:11.002
a ballpark Frank?

06:11.004 --> 06:12.704
I hate hot dogs.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.974
They remind me of
uncircumcised penises.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.477
And you know I don't stand
for no wormies.

06:18.479 --> 06:21.012
Oh, uh, well,
forget about food.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.814
Let's go find a memento
to share.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.216
Shouldn't be hard.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.885
My personal favorite --
the bobblehead.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.587
Ew, creepy.

06:28.589 --> 06:32.023
Their proportions are all wrong,
like little Christina Riccis.

06:32.025 --> 06:35.527
How about these gender-neutral
pink baseball caps?

06:35.529 --> 06:39.931
Haha! You're hilarious.
(laughs)

06:39.933 --> 06:43.034
(crowd murmuring)

06:43.036 --> 06:45.103
hey, I know something we
agree on.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.505
Hot guys.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.274
Check out Jayson Werth
in right field.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.709
He's got ass for days.

06:50.711 --> 06:53.011
I think you're hotter
than he is.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.413
Can't we agree
on anything?!

06:54.415 --> 06:55.947
Compared to that
fresh cut of meat,

06:55.949 --> 06:58.183
I'm a double-scoop of
dog shit!

07:00.120 --> 07:02.120
All right, Steve,
I drafted a bill

07:02.122 --> 07:04.423
proposing drinking water
not be poisonous.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.124
Now, let's drop it off
and hit the road.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.927
Well, if it isn't
Burt Jarvis!

07:08.929 --> 07:11.129
Lookin' good, old friend.

07:11.131 --> 07:15.100
Say, we got to get you and Carla
up to the lake house.

07:15.102 --> 07:18.103
You wouldn't believe the size of
the trout this season,

07:18.105 --> 07:21.039
and are they a-bitin'.

07:21.041 --> 07:24.209
I hear you've been working on
a clean water bill.

07:24.211 --> 07:27.712
Now, this is a nice piece
of legislation.

07:27.714 --> 07:30.649
A noble undertaking
indeed.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.985
It's a shame
no one got to see it.

07:33.987 --> 07:37.589
My best to Carla.

07:37.591 --> 07:40.125
Did you hear that?
I'm gonna get to go fishing!

07:40.127 --> 07:43.662
Roger, you can't just back down!
People are counting on you!

07:43.664 --> 07:45.997
Are you crazy?
That was Big John Tanner,

07:45.999 --> 07:48.467
the most influential
politician in Nevada.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.769
Who do you think we're talking
about -- Little John Tanner?

07:50.771 --> 07:53.338
One of the least influential
politicians in Nevada?

07:53.340 --> 07:56.675
Ahem! I represent the good
people of Winnemucca.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.246
So to answer
your questions --

08:01.248 --> 08:04.316
"John from Cincinnati"
is my favorite HBO show,

08:04.318 --> 08:06.751
Lycos is
my preferred search engine,

08:06.753 --> 08:09.020
and when it comes to
World War II,

08:09.022 --> 08:12.190
I got to go with my boys,
the Axis powers.

08:12.192 --> 08:15.260
Hey, buddy! You and that fascist
are on the kiss cam!

08:15.262 --> 08:16.895
Show 'em what you got!

08:18.332 --> 08:21.333
I will show 'em!
This is our moment!

08:27.307 --> 08:29.207
(smack, both groan)

08:29.209 --> 08:31.710
(sneezes)

08:31.712 --> 08:34.513
WOMAN: You guys suck!
MAN: Don't get a room!

08:34.515 --> 08:37.616
MAN: I kiss my sister
with more grace.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.357
I thought me and Francine
were fine,

08:45.359 --> 08:47.225
but we don't share anything.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.895
Hell, we couldn't even share
a kiss on the kiss cam.

08:49.897 --> 08:54.032
50,000 fans called B.S. on
our whole relationship.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.468
A group that big
is never wrong.

08:56.470 --> 09:00.205
That's why it's called "mob
mentality," not "mob stupidity."

09:00.207 --> 09:04.309
Just the word "mob" evokes
such fairness and justice.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.578
I guess it's really over.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.013
Bad news, Hayley.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.881
Your parents
are getting divorced.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.651
Now you're gonna have to buy
a second headband

09:12.653 --> 09:14.052
to keep at Stan's apartment.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.321
What is he talking about?
I just --

09:16.323 --> 09:20.425
I realized that Francine and I
don't have any common ground.

09:20.427 --> 09:23.428
Dad, every couple has
their differences.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.664
Look at me and Jeff.
We couldn't be more opposite.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.733
She's right, Mr. S. -- like, my
favorite song in the world

09:28.735 --> 09:31.202
is "Bathtub Gin" by Phish
live at Red Rocks.

09:31.204 --> 09:34.606
But mine is "Bathtub Gin" by
Phish live from Atlantic City.

09:34.608 --> 09:37.175
I'm sure you and Mrs. S. were
just having an off day.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.411
But if you want to strengthen
your relationship,

09:39.413 --> 09:41.112
that takes time.

09:41.114 --> 09:44.349
It requires open communication,
a lot of hard work --

09:44.351 --> 09:46.451
Jeff's right!
It must have been an off day.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.186
We'll just get back on
the kiss cam,

09:48.188 --> 09:50.121
show everybody that
me and Francine are fine,

09:50.123 --> 09:52.223
and then everything else
will fall into place!

09:52.225 --> 09:54.859
You think you can be on
the kiss cam twice?

09:54.861 --> 09:58.363
Why not go for three times?
Five? 100 times?!

09:58.365 --> 10:02.033
You kill us all with
your arrogance, Stan!

10:04.571 --> 10:07.205
All right, Roger,
I'm off to the hall of records,

10:07.207 --> 10:09.708
see if I can sniff out
who's polluting the water.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.777
Cool. I actually have a full day
of campaigning to do.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.580
Elections are coming up,
and according to polls,

10:15.582 --> 10:18.383
I'm "mysteriously missing
and presumed dead."

10:18.385 --> 10:21.119
¶¶

10:21.121 --> 10:23.922
(applause)

10:23.924 --> 10:27.025
¶¶

10:30.063 --> 10:32.063
(applause)

10:34.901 --> 10:35.967
(gasps)

10:40.807 --> 10:42.774
(applause)

10:42.776 --> 10:45.276
(cheering)

10:45.278 --> 10:47.779
Stan, how long till
this game is over?

10:47.781 --> 10:50.015
Okay, you know how it feels like
we've been here forever?

10:50.017 --> 10:53.752
Well, that was only one inning,
so nine times forever.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.024
He hasn't even
hit our section once.

10:59.026 --> 11:01.026
This guy needs a talking to.

11:01.028 --> 11:04.596
Stan, while you're up,
find out what they're saying

11:04.598 --> 11:07.532
after
"Da-da-da-da-da-daaaa!"

11:07.534 --> 11:09.668
Is it "shards"?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.508
(cheering)

11:16.510 --> 11:18.276
Whoa!
What was that?

11:18.278 --> 11:21.946
That was a triple play, which
means Arby's has to donate

11:21.948 --> 11:23.181
$500 to charity.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.183
Good.
I hate that place.

11:28.722 --> 11:32.357
If Tetradual's the one doing the
dumping, we'll know soon enough.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.492
Oh, look who finally
pipes up.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.161
We've been in the car for
20 minutes

11:36.163 --> 11:37.896
and that's the first thing
you've said.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.565
I know. Sorry. Catching up
on e-mails from Klaus.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.901
Oh, my God. That guy is out of
control, right?

11:42.903 --> 11:44.402
Does he send you
like 10 a day?

11:44.404 --> 11:47.038
Yes! And they're all about
nothing, like,

11:47.040 --> 11:50.208
"How awesome would it be
if we both had corvettes?"

11:50.210 --> 11:53.011
But if you don't write back,
he flips out.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.345
Such a bitch.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.980
There it is!

11:55.982 --> 11:57.816
It doesn't look so bad
to me.

11:57.818 --> 12:00.151
They're not gonna be dumping
in the open, Roger.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.920
More likely underground
spill-off

12:01.922 --> 12:03.755
is slowly polluting
the water table.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.491
Whoa!

12:06.493 --> 12:09.360
Got to love that Nevada
razzle-dazzle.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.396
Oh, my God!

12:24.544 --> 12:25.944
We've got 'em.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.846
(sighs)
I should have seen this coming.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.247
Why's that?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.983
Because I'm the CEO
of Tetradual.

12:33.687 --> 12:35.353
Uh, excuse me.
I was wondering --

12:35.355 --> 12:37.756
Wondering if I'll put you
on the kiss cam.

12:37.758 --> 12:40.291
Well, yes. You see --
I know your story.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.761
Johnny Jalopy brings
Susie Swiss-Cheese-Shorts

12:42.763 --> 12:45.096
to the ball game,
hoping to shine her teeth

12:45.098 --> 12:47.699
with his tongue-polish --
but she's all Nancy No-go,

12:47.701 --> 12:50.301
so you're Gary Got-an-Idea
and you Tommy Two-step

12:50.303 --> 12:52.537
to Kenny Kkiss-cam
to grease her wheels.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.539
Stop me if this
sounds familiar.

12:54.541 --> 12:57.108
Oh, shit.
Are you my boss?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.244
Hey, I recognize you.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.079
You were the biggest misfire
of my career!

13:01.081 --> 13:03.548
No, we weren't!
And I can prove it.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.950
Just put us back on the
jumbotron, no big deal.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.987
No big deal? Was
the moon landing no big deal?

13:08.989 --> 13:11.623
Was "Who Framed Roger Rabbit"
no big deal?

13:11.625 --> 13:14.125
Seamlessly blending live-action
and animation?!

13:14.127 --> 13:16.161
You know who would
disagree with you?

13:16.163 --> 13:17.929
Bob Hoskins.
God rest his soul.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.430
So let me ask you this.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.800
Do you speak ill of
the dead, sir?

13:21.802 --> 13:23.768
You know what, don't even
answer -- you're rambling.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.637
I can't following anything
you're saying.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.472
You're going to put us on
the jumbotron,

13:27.474 --> 13:29.240
or you can kiss-cam
your ass goodbye.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.143
(rapid gunfire)

13:33.747 --> 13:37.482
Now, is one of you gonna tell
me what's going on here?

13:38.485 --> 13:39.684
You can't do this!

13:39.686 --> 13:41.419
What's going on here?

13:41.421 --> 13:44.355
Your husband assaulted an
innocent kiss cam operator.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.691
He got himself banned for life.

13:46.693 --> 13:49.027
Come on, Francine, let's go.
Unh-unh, I'm staying here.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.296
What?!
First, you buy me a gift

13:51.298 --> 13:55.433
that is clearly for yourself,
and now you're taking it away?

13:55.435 --> 13:57.101
Forget it, Stan.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.437
Plus, they just opened
a spaghetti place

13:59.439 --> 14:02.574
on the club level --
it comes in a helmet.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.545
Let me in right now!

14:07.547 --> 14:08.980
Or what?
Or...

14:08.982 --> 14:10.448
Or I'll hurt your feelings!

14:10.450 --> 14:11.783
Beat it, buddy.

14:11.785 --> 14:15.286
You have a terrible body.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.488
Open the gate.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.957
(screams)

14:22.329 --> 14:24.829
(Stan crying)

14:24.831 --> 14:27.465
Hey, no tears, little man.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.902
(blows raspberry)

14:30.904 --> 14:33.638
(laughs)

14:33.640 --> 14:35.340
There we go.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.742
Now why's my favorite
little cowboy

14:37.744 --> 14:40.311
got a case of
the upside-down smiles?

14:40.313 --> 14:42.513
My relationship with Francine
is crumbling,

14:42.515 --> 14:43.882
and the only way to save it

14:43.884 --> 14:46.084
is to rock her mouth
on the kiss cam.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.819
But I was banned from
the stadium

14:47.821 --> 14:50.555
for threatening the cameraman.
That's preposterous.

14:50.557 --> 14:54.759
The only reason to ban someone
from a stadium is for streaking.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.928
I don't go to the game
to be aroused.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.097
Or if you're going to
allow streaking,

14:59.099 --> 15:01.032
for heaven's sake,
allow masturbating.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.533
Amen, brother.

15:02.535 --> 15:05.003
I just need a way to get
back into that stadium.

15:05.005 --> 15:08.172
Consider all of the CIA
at your full disposal.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.607
Oh, thank you, sir.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.843
Maybe I could parachute in from
a helicopter,

15:11.845 --> 15:13.745
or scuba dive in from
the sewer, or --

15:13.747 --> 15:17.749
(laughs) There's a much easier
way to get in, Smith.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.817
¶¶

15:23.189 --> 15:25.623
(bell rings)

15:29.095 --> 15:32.597
¶¶

15:59.659 --> 16:04.062
"Mister Johnson has a dog."

16:04.064 --> 16:06.798
"Meester Juanson has a dog."

16:11.338 --> 16:13.204
(camera shutter clicks)

16:16.009 --> 16:17.575
Don't break down on us.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.144
We need you if we're gonna
win the East.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.480
¶¶

16:28.588 --> 16:31.489
I know he hasn't looked the same
since the suspension,

16:31.491 --> 16:34.192
but the numbers say Smith could
actually be useful

16:34.194 --> 16:35.360
against lefties for us.

16:38.531 --> 16:41.933
(cheering)

16:48.775 --> 16:51.509
Right on time.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.119
Sir, I have Stan and Francine
in my sights.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.990
Stan, what are you doing here?
I thought you were banned.

17:05.992 --> 17:09.027
I am, but there's something
in this stadium

17:09.029 --> 17:11.362
just too precious for me
to leave behind.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.866
(Hall & Oates'
"You Make My Dreams" plays)

17:14.868 --> 17:16.200
Not them again.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.103
You monsters!

17:22.008 --> 17:27.245
¶ What I want, you've got,
and it might be hard to handle ¶

17:27.247 --> 17:29.414
Hey!
That's my wife!

17:29.416 --> 17:31.215
What?
And the only person allowed

17:31.217 --> 17:33.651
to kiss her is me, and the men
I select for her on tinder.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.720
I'm sorry.
I meant to kiss my wife.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.989
She's part of this, too?
You're both banned!

17:37.991 --> 17:39.524
What the hell's going on?!

17:39.526 --> 17:41.059
You're out of here.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.397
Damn.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.934
¶ You make my dreams ¶

17:49.936 --> 17:52.070
You on tinder?

17:55.909 --> 17:59.577
People, this company has brought
nothing but pain and suffering

17:59.579 --> 18:02.180
to our community,
and I'm shutting it down.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.284
You just turned off
the receptionist's computer.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.286
Well, not even that --
just the monitor.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.089
Well, sorry for trying to make
it look cool for you, Steve.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.224
To actually
close this place down,

18:13.226 --> 18:16.461
I have to send like 13 e-mails
all saying the same thing

18:16.463 --> 18:18.629
all to Cliff in operations.

18:18.631 --> 18:21.432
Yeah, I'm --
I'm bored just saying it.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.442
I can't take this
tension anymore!

18:31.444 --> 18:33.144
(tires squeal)

18:33.146 --> 18:35.713
What are you doing?
Look, I know you're mad.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.049
Damn right, I'm mad.
Yeah, well, I'm mad, too.

18:38.051 --> 18:39.884
But mostly I'm sad.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.719
We've grown apart.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.321
And I'm worried about us,
Francine.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.256
We don't share anything anymore.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.325
We couldn't even share
a good kiss!

18:47.327 --> 18:49.127
What are you talking about?

18:49.129 --> 18:52.964
I'm mad because they pulled
Martinez after only 80 pitches.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.966
Wait.
You were into the game?

18:54.968 --> 18:58.069
The Nats are only one game back
in the wild card,

18:58.071 --> 19:00.972
and Martinez clearly had
heat left in his arm!

19:00.974 --> 19:02.974
What, are they saving him
for the playoffs?

19:02.976 --> 19:04.842
There's not gonna be
any damn playoffs!

19:04.844 --> 19:08.479
Mr. Johnson has a dog!
You like baseball!

19:08.481 --> 19:10.114
We do share something!

19:10.116 --> 19:12.650
Of course we share
something, Stan.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.919
We're been married
for 20 years.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.688
We have?
We may not share everything,

19:17.690 --> 19:20.124
but we share
the important things --

19:20.126 --> 19:24.028
a beautiful life,
two kids, HPV.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.997
And that's forever, Stan.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.832
I feel so stupid.

19:27.834 --> 19:31.836
Well, at least you didn't pull
Martinez after 80 pitches.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.672
Come here.
(moaning)

19:34.674 --> 19:38.476
¶ You make my dreams come true,
you-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo ¶

19:38.478 --> 19:41.345
REPORTER:<i> It is absolute</i>
<i> carnage out here on 95.</i>

19:41.347 --> 19:44.482
<i> Well, what do we have here?</i>
<i> Looks like all this wreckage</i>

19:44.484 --> 19:46.851
<i> and suffering is just</i>
<i> collateral damage,</i>

19:46.853 --> 19:49.854
<i> because that's</i>
<i> a kiss for the ages.</i>

19:49.856 --> 19:51.789
(cheering)

19:51.791 --> 19:54.559
Use that magnificent tongue,
Stan!

19:54.561 --> 19:57.361
(cheering)

19:59.532 --> 20:03.467
¶ I can laugh it in the face ¶

20:03.469 --> 20:06.003
He did it.

20:06.005 --> 20:10.141
He got this stadium hornier
than I ever could've imagined.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.379
Oh, yeah.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.582
¶ Well, 'cause you,
ooh-ho, hoo-ooh, ooh-oo ¶

20:17.584 --> 20:19.483
Nice.

20:19.485 --> 20:22.186
Team Jarvis,
I have good news.

20:22.188 --> 20:25.056
We found out Tetradual was
tainting the water

20:25.058 --> 20:27.558
and we shut 'em down.
Four more years!

20:27.560 --> 20:30.394
Four more years --
are not happening.

20:30.396 --> 20:34.098
Tetradual was my only
campaign contributor, so...

20:34.100 --> 20:36.767
Pack it up.
Hyah!

20:36.769 --> 20:38.002
(thud)

20:45.578 --> 20:48.045
Tetradual is gone,
but Octodual is

20:48.047 --> 20:51.048
very interested in your
re-election campaign.

20:51.050 --> 20:54.051
Why don't we discuss it
at the lake house?

20:54.053 --> 20:57.655
So, Big John,
why do they call you big?

20:59.359 --> 21:02.193
ROGER: Do you even like me?

21:02.195 --> 21:04.161
Bye!
Have a beautiful time!
