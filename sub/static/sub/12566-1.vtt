(Hank): Thank you. Oh, what's this?

11:15.414 --> 11:18.666
(Newberg): The next episode
of <i>52 Parties.</i>

11:18.718 --> 11:21.001
- No way, I love that show.
- How many what now?

11:21.003 --> 11:22.169
What show? What are we talking about?

11:22.171 --> 11:23.837
It's... it's a new reality show on Bravo.

11:23.839 --> 11:25.255
And a big, fat hit.

11:25.308 --> 11:27.841
- (Gasps)
- And look. There's Aubrey Wolfhouse.

11:27.843 --> 11:29.977
She's the anti-Martha Stewart.

11:30.012 --> 11:31.345
It's not about making it perfect.

11:31.347 --> 11:33.180
It's about knowing it won't be.

11:33.232 --> 11:34.598
(Both): The party must go on.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.100
- (Chuckles)
- Okay.

11:36.152 --> 11:38.018
Well, how did you get her to film here?

11:38.020 --> 11:42.156
Well, let's just say Andy
Cohen owes me a favor.

11:42.191 --> 11:44.024
Aubrey is helping me throw a welcome party

11:44.026 --> 11:45.275
for my new neighbor, Muggsy.

11:45.328 --> 11:46.360
His name is Muggsy?

11:46.412 --> 11:48.245
Did he move here from the 1920s underworld?

11:48.280 --> 11:51.365
Apparently, he's very
sweet. That's all I know.

11:51.417 --> 11:53.334
That and the fact that
he gave me and Aubrey

11:53.369 --> 11:56.086
a great excuse for a party.

11:56.122 --> 11:59.423
(Becki): Let's go in tight on the trimming.

11:59.458 --> 12:01.258
Here comes our Emmy.

12:04.964 --> 12:06.130
What exactly is wrong with her?

12:06.182 --> 12:07.881
She looks pretty healthy to me.

12:07.883 --> 12:10.467
Well, I didn't call you about her.

12:10.519 --> 12:13.520
Oh, you look very healthy too, Ms. Newberg.

12:13.556 --> 12:16.523
I feel healthy. Vigorous, even.

12:16.559 --> 12:18.726
Especially after last weekend
when I went to see your dad

12:18.728 --> 12:19.943
upstate during his book tour.

12:19.979 --> 12:21.311
I have a feeling I'm not gonna want to hear

12:21.364 --> 12:22.363
too much more about it.

12:22.398 --> 12:24.398
Our time together is so special.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.283
Exhausting, really, if
you know what I mean.

12:26.318 --> 12:27.651
We do, we do.

12:27.703 --> 12:30.454
But when I got back
home, I realized there was

12:30.489 --> 12:33.657
pink in my tink.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.325
Huh.

12:35.378 --> 12:36.326
Blood in your urine.

12:36.379 --> 12:38.796
Ahh. Yes, um, any pain?

12:38.831 --> 12:40.748
Well, I am a little sore.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.750
I was up there for three days,
and nobody goes to Buffalo

12:42.802 --> 12:43.917
for the sightseeing, if you know what I...

12:43.919 --> 12:45.719
Yes, we know exactly what you mean.

12:45.755 --> 12:47.671
Ms. Newberg, it's probably
a bladder infection.

12:47.723 --> 12:49.056
We'll get a urine sample and prescribe you

12:49.091 --> 12:50.591
some antibiotics.

12:50.593 --> 12:53.260
(Screams)

12:53.312 --> 12:55.095
And this is why you should
wear gardening gloves

12:55.097 --> 12:56.096
when you do this.

12:56.098 --> 12:57.431
You pricked yourself with a thorn?

12:57.433 --> 12:59.183
I trimmed myself with the shears.

12:59.235 --> 13:00.651
Can we get a first aid kit outside?

13:00.686 --> 13:02.770
I can do you one better than that.

13:02.822 --> 13:03.937
I'm Hank. Hi.

13:03.939 --> 13:05.823
Um, I'm a doctor. Can I take a look?

13:08.277 --> 13:10.828
Okay. Not too bad.

13:10.863 --> 13:13.163
(Paige): Okay.

13:13.199 --> 13:14.531
Ahh.

13:14.583 --> 13:16.617
Okay, put me down, so I can go run around.

13:16.669 --> 13:18.168
(Squeals)

13:19.839 --> 13:22.756
Do you believe this place is actually ours?

13:22.792 --> 13:25.209
Uh, financially, the evidence
is pretty convincing, so yeah.

13:25.261 --> 13:26.960
Babe, don't rain on this.

13:27.012 --> 13:28.712
I'm not, I'm not... I'm sorry, I am not.

13:28.764 --> 13:31.799
I... it is amazing. It's truly amazing.

13:31.801 --> 13:34.384
- Isn't it perfect?
- And it's ours.

13:34.437 --> 13:35.803
- This is our house.
- I know.

13:35.805 --> 13:38.555
- I mean, look at our floors.
- Look at our fireplace!

13:38.607 --> 13:40.891
Look at... oh, my God, loot at our wet bar!

13:40.943 --> 13:43.110
Yeah, that wet bar is going
straight to wet bar heaven.

13:43.145 --> 13:44.144
I thought I'd slip that one through

13:44.146 --> 13:45.446
while you were excited.

13:45.481 --> 13:48.782
Aside from that, this
place needs so little work.

13:48.818 --> 13:51.401
Can I just say, it is so nice to see you

13:51.454 --> 13:53.454
in such an unexpectedly pleasant mood?

13:53.489 --> 13:55.405
Unexpectedly?

13:55.458 --> 13:57.124
Hmm?

13:58.780 --> 14:01.545
You know, 'cause of
the... 'cause of the, uh...

14:01.580 --> 14:03.714
time of the month?

14:03.749 --> 14:05.499
I actually have an app.

14:05.501 --> 14:07.084
What kind of app?

14:07.136 --> 14:09.136
It's, you know, it's just...

14:09.171 --> 14:12.339
just tracks your, uh, cycles.

14:12.391 --> 14:13.924
It does what?

14:13.976 --> 14:16.343
It's called Red Dragon.

14:16.395 --> 14:18.011
(Chuckles)

14:22.017 --> 14:26.069
Evan, I just... realized I'm late.

14:26.105 --> 14:27.604
You mean the dragon's still in the castle?

14:27.656 --> 14:32.242
Yeah, and I'm never late.

14:33.913 --> 14:37.164
You're saying you could be...
I mean, we could be...

14:37.199 --> 14:39.199
I don't know. Probably not.

14:39.201 --> 14:40.200
I mean, we can't be.

14:40.202 --> 14:41.535
Technically, we could be.

14:41.537 --> 14:42.920
Right, but what I'm saying
is that we just can't be.

14:42.955 --> 14:43.921
Yeah, 'cause that would be crazy.

14:43.956 --> 14:46.206
Yeah.

14:46.208 --> 14:47.925
But I think we should
go buy a pregnancy test

14:47.960 --> 14:49.042
just to be on the safe side.

14:49.094 --> 14:51.879
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

14:51.931 --> 14:54.965
- Oh, right now?
- Yes, Evan, right now.

14:55.017 --> 14:56.774
Unless you can do that with your phone too.

14:56.804 --> 14:59.386
I think that would
probably void the warranty.

15:05.266 --> 15:06.866
♪ ♪

15:14.032 --> 15:15.804
Are... are you sure
you want this on camera?

15:15.834 --> 15:17.050
Mm-hmm.

15:17.085 --> 15:18.835
Oh, I have had a lot more
mishaps than usual lately.

15:18.867 --> 15:20.367
Fortunately, it's all very on-brand.

15:20.402 --> 15:23.536
- Huh?
- Welcome to reality TV.

15:23.572 --> 15:24.621
Thanks for being game.

15:24.656 --> 15:26.373
Welcome to medicine in the Hamptons.

15:26.408 --> 15:28.908
(Laughs)

15:28.910 --> 15:30.710
You know, you are super telegenic

15:30.746 --> 15:34.080
with that killer smile and
hair that could lift a car.

15:34.132 --> 15:36.249
Just curious, are you single?

15:36.251 --> 15:39.386
Uh, I don't want to bore your
viewers with my personal life.

15:39.421 --> 15:42.639
- Hmm.
- So why <i> 52 Parties?</i>

15:42.674 --> 15:43.840
(Whispers): I did have a much cooler name,

15:43.892 --> 15:45.175
but the network made me change it.

15:45.227 --> 15:46.893
No, I meant the number, not the name.

15:46.928 --> 15:50.180
Ah, well, hosting is nerve-racking.

15:50.232 --> 15:52.348
Even just a dinner party
or having a few friends over

15:52.401 --> 15:55.852
for some binge watching...
bringing people into your home,

15:55.904 --> 15:57.987
you feel like your entire
identity's being judged.

15:58.023 --> 15:59.656
Huh, I never looked at it that way.

15:59.691 --> 16:00.657
Do you host a lot of parties?

16:00.692 --> 16:02.075
Do staff meetings count?

16:02.110 --> 16:04.327
(Laughs)

16:04.362 --> 16:06.279
So you plan all week, wanting
everything to be perfect,

16:06.281 --> 16:08.415
but inevitably, something will go wrong,

16:08.450 --> 16:10.784
and some people hit those
hurdles and they give up.

16:10.836 --> 16:12.285
They think they're not cut out for it,

16:12.287 --> 16:15.288
but you gotta make the
mistakes part of the fun.

16:15.290 --> 16:17.123
The party must go on.

16:17.175 --> 16:18.374
And you go right into the next party

16:18.427 --> 16:19.459
and then the one after that...

16:19.461 --> 16:21.044
And then 49 more.

16:21.096 --> 16:22.295
Have one very fun year.

16:22.297 --> 16:23.630
And one very clever TV show.

16:23.632 --> 16:25.014
Aw.

16:25.050 --> 16:27.884
Although I'm not sure
overcoming life's hurdles

16:27.936 --> 16:28.968
is that easy.

16:28.970 --> 16:31.471
Well, about 1.2 million 18- to 49-year-olds

16:31.473 --> 16:32.972
want to believe that it is.

16:32.974 --> 16:35.141
All right, sounds like you
got a hit on your hands.

16:35.193 --> 16:37.727
I was just as surprised as anyone.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.779
Of course, now the pressure
is on to deliver big

16:39.815 --> 16:41.064
for season two.

16:41.116 --> 16:42.482
Huh.

16:42.534 --> 16:43.900
What?

16:43.952 --> 16:45.201
No, I just wondered if
that's why you're having

16:45.237 --> 16:48.655
even more accidents than
usual lately... the nerves.

16:48.707 --> 16:51.074
- Huh.
- Look what I've got.

16:51.126 --> 16:52.948
And there's plenty more
where this came from.

16:52.978 --> 16:54.444
Please tell me that's not your sample.

16:54.479 --> 16:55.645
Oh, no, no. I've got that.

16:55.697 --> 16:58.231
No, this is the greatest
rosé in the world.

16:58.283 --> 17:00.150
Want some?

17:00.202 --> 17:01.317
No.

17:01.370 --> 17:03.536
Bye, Divs!

17:05.540 --> 17:08.657
Hank, thanks so much again
for coming so quickly.

17:08.710 --> 17:11.044
My pleasure, every single time.

17:11.079 --> 17:14.329
Now, I'm going to insist
that you charge me this time,

17:14.383 --> 17:16.750
at least until your father
makes an honest woman out of me,

17:16.801 --> 17:18.385
so we are officially family.

17:18.420 --> 17:19.836
Sorry, no deal.

17:19.887 --> 17:22.338
Well, then, you and Charlotte
must come to my welcome party,

17:22.391 --> 17:25.058
so I can spoil you both
with champagne, caviar,

17:25.093 --> 17:26.925
and a TV camera in your face.

17:26.928 --> 17:29.345
Uh, I don't think that'll be possible,

17:29.398 --> 17:30.730
but I'll see if Divya's available.

17:30.766 --> 17:33.400
She's a big fan of Aubrey.

17:33.435 --> 17:37.103
What happened with Charlotte?

17:37.105 --> 17:41.858
Hank, I've been through more
than my share of breakups,

17:41.910 --> 17:43.326
and even though I stopped counting

17:43.361 --> 17:46.863
separations and divorces
when I hit double digits,

17:46.915 --> 17:49.082
it didn't mean it stopped hurting.

17:49.117 --> 17:52.786
They always hurt. Every single time.

17:52.788 --> 17:56.790
So then... fess up.

17:58.593 --> 18:02.212
Things between Charlotte
and me ended last night.

18:02.264 --> 18:05.215
- Ohh, Hank.
- Oh, look!

18:05.267 --> 18:07.300
I have my next patient
now, but thank you so much

18:07.352 --> 18:08.301
for your concern, Ms. Newberg.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.353
You are the best.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:19.114 --> 18:20.613
You know what, let's do another.

18:20.649 --> 18:21.614
Just to be sure, yeah?

18:21.650 --> 18:23.483
That was another.

18:23.485 --> 18:27.987
That was the third another.

18:28.039 --> 18:30.573
Evan, we're sure.

18:32.461 --> 18:34.327
Hmm.

18:34.379 --> 18:36.496
Don't you have a meeting at the hospital?

18:36.548 --> 18:38.915
Yeah, but I also... I also have this.

18:38.967 --> 18:42.001
And, obviously, this is big news.

18:42.053 --> 18:43.920
Big.

18:43.972 --> 18:45.588
But you still have your job.

18:45.640 --> 18:50.426
Your big, new, very important job.

18:50.479 --> 18:52.729
Right.

18:54.733 --> 18:56.983
(Sighs)

18:58.520 --> 19:00.395
(Exhales)

19:02.157 --> 19:03.995
We're not ready, uh, at all.

19:04.025 --> 19:05.191
We are not ready.

19:05.193 --> 19:06.493
We don't have a name.
We don't have a car seat.

19:06.528 --> 19:07.777
We don't have a crib.

19:07.829 --> 19:08.945
I don't even know anything
about any of that stuff.

19:08.997 --> 19:10.029
We're gonna have to read a lot of books.

19:10.031 --> 19:11.364
And the house isn't ready.

19:11.416 --> 19:13.199
And what about you,
shouldn't you be eating kale?

19:13.201 --> 19:14.367
Or vomiting or both?

19:14.419 --> 19:16.202
I'm pregnant, not bulimic.

19:16.254 --> 19:19.038
Well... what do we do?

19:19.090 --> 19:22.008
Hey, I'm freaking out too, believe me.

19:22.043 --> 19:25.628
Let's at least try to
freak out together, okay?

19:25.680 --> 19:27.680
(Sighs)

19:27.716 --> 19:30.600
I'm gonna postpone my
meeting, 'cause I can do that

19:30.635 --> 19:31.718
when I'm the one in charge.

19:31.770 --> 19:34.387
I appreciate that.

19:34.389 --> 19:38.892
The good news is, we've got
nine months to adjust to this.

19:38.944 --> 19:43.530
So let's just take some time to process it.

19:46.902 --> 19:49.652
Okay.

19:53.208 --> 19:54.574
(Knock at door)

19:54.576 --> 19:56.576
Yeah.

19:59.965 --> 20:03.666
So this is really your office?

20:03.718 --> 20:06.252
You find it lacking in some manner?

20:06.254 --> 20:10.890
No, no. Just doesn't seem... Boris-y.

20:12.744 --> 20:14.827
I assume you're here to question my choice

20:14.863 --> 20:16.279
of interim administrator?

20:16.331 --> 20:17.363
(Chuckles)

20:17.365 --> 20:19.248
I'll admit it's unconventional,

20:19.284 --> 20:21.367
but I know Evan will do a great job.

20:21.369 --> 20:23.119
No, I'm here to follow
up on your dizzy spell

20:23.171 --> 20:24.120
during the meeting.

20:24.172 --> 20:26.184
Yes, that would have been my next guess.

20:26.214 --> 20:28.458
Any other episodes lately?

20:28.510 --> 20:29.792
Perhaps one or two.

20:29.844 --> 20:32.095
Okay, I'd like to do a neuro exam.
