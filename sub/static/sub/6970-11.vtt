00:12.278 --> 00:15.213
Quiet! Quiet! Listen to me.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.675
lt was a terrible thing.

00:22.188 --> 00:26.352
You are not going to believe me,
even when l tell you.

00:27.460 --> 00:31.954
Some say it is a story, a fairy tale.

00:33.466 --> 00:35.559
But l saw it.

00:35.635 --> 00:38.763
l saw it with my own eyes.

00:50.183 --> 00:53.346
Quiero hombres fuertes. ¡Rápido!

01:07.033 --> 01:09.024
Oye, mi amor.

01:10.837 --> 01:13.829
- Pórtate bien.
- Tú también.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.898
Pues claro.

01:32.125 --> 01:33.922
Gracias.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.431
- No.
- Sí.

01:49.509 --> 01:50.874
No.

01:51.644 --> 01:53.771
Let's go!

01:58.585 --> 02:00.018
Maria!

02:23.076 --> 02:25.067
Eso es seguro.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.318
Las cabras.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.518
Maria!

03:15.695 --> 03:17.060
Maria!

03:18.097 --> 03:20.088
Maria!

03:22.402 --> 03:24.393
Maria!

03:39.686 --> 03:41.677
Madre de Dios.

04:36.643 --> 04:39.407
Mulder, this happened how long ago?

04:39.479 --> 04:43.040
Tres días. Muy increíble, ¿no?

04:44.250 --> 04:46.616
Only the smell.

04:46.686 --> 04:51.180
You brought me out here under the pretense
of investigating an unexplained death.

04:51.257 --> 04:54.420
Can you tell me why we're standing
out here looking at a dead goat?

04:54.494 --> 04:59.124
According to eyewitnesses, the death
was preceded by a fortean event:

04:59.198 --> 05:02.429
a highly unusual or infrequent
meteorological phenomenon,

05:02.502 --> 05:05.733
- also known as a transient.
- A transient?

05:05.805 --> 05:09.297
Witnesses described a bright flash
about 30 degrees off the horizon.

05:09.375 --> 05:14.642
A hot, yellow rain fell from a cloudless sky.
Fortean researchers call these liquid falls.

05:14.714 --> 05:19.845
Black and red rains are common, but there
have also been blue, purple and green rains.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.080
- Purple rain?
- Yeah. Great album.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.521
Deeply flawed movie, though.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.888
Mulder, this transient, as you call it,

05:26.959 --> 05:31.362
this bright flash in the sky - l assume
you think it has some connection to...

05:31.431 --> 05:35.197
Fortean events have been linked
to alien encounters. Cattle mutilations.

05:35.268 --> 05:38.294
The kind of exsanguinated
animal carcass you were looking at.

05:38.371 --> 05:41.397
The victim, Maria Dorantes -
did she die in a similar fashion?

05:41.474 --> 05:43.806
- l would assume so.
- You assume?

05:44.744 --> 05:47.679
- Nobody's examined the body?
- Nobody cares, Scully.

05:47.747 --> 05:52.309
The victim and many of the witnesses are
illegal immigrants, migrant farm workers.

05:52.385 --> 05:56.719
l thought it might be important
to talk to them before they migrated.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.101
No, no.

06:20.179 --> 06:22.374
No la migra. No la migra.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.439
No la migra.

06:25.618 --> 06:28.382
We're FBl. No la migra.

06:28.454 --> 06:32.515
lt's all right. We don't wanna take
anybody away. Relax. No, it's OK.

06:32.592 --> 06:34.924
What do you want?

06:35.661 --> 06:38.653
We wanna know what happened
to Maria Dorantes.

06:40.767 --> 06:45.170
Does anybody know what happened to
Maria Dorantes? Did anybody see anything?

06:45.238 --> 06:48.867
El Chupacabra.
That's what happened to Maria Dorantes.

06:48.941 --> 06:52.843
- El Chupacabra?
- Yeah, it's a Mexican folk tale.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.881
El Chupacabra, the goat-sucker:
a small, gray creature

06:55.948 --> 06:58.974
with a big head and a small body
and big, black bulging eyes.

06:59.051 --> 07:01.042
Sí, sí, sí.

07:01.888 --> 07:04.618
Light, then rain.

07:05.658 --> 07:10.425
Then El Chupacabra, it comes
and eats away Maria's eyes and face.

07:12.498 --> 07:15.058
- Did you see the Chupacabra?
- No.

07:15.134 --> 07:17.534
But everyone here knows
that this is the truth.

07:17.603 --> 07:23.599
This woman's a liar. There is no Chupacabra.
lt's nothing but a story told to children.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.434
l know the killer of Maria Dorantes.

07:26.512 --> 07:30.039
- Who would that be, sir?
- lt's my brother. Eladio Buente.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.983
He killed Maria because she loved only me.

07:33.052 --> 07:36.886
How do you explain the yellow rain then,
and the dead goat over the hill?

07:36.956 --> 07:41.120
lt is a trick... for fools
who believe in fool superstitions.

07:42.962 --> 07:46.125
Thank you, Mr Buente.
You've been very helpful.

07:50.603 --> 07:53.265
''Maria, Maria.''

07:53.339 --> 07:55.807
''l've just met a girl named Maria.''

07:55.875 --> 07:59.367
- Doesn't make a whole lot of sense, Scully.
- Makes perfect sense.

07:59.445 --> 08:01.345
Admit it, you fell for it.

08:01.414 --> 08:05.908
Your fortean event turned out to be nothing
more than the oldest story in the world.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.419
Two men, one woman, trouble.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.321
l admit there's a strong suspicion
of motive and intent.

08:11.390 --> 08:14.018
But the detail,
the description of that Chupacabra.

08:14.093 --> 08:19.030
Mulder, what we've walked into here is
a Mexican soap opera, one for the local cops.

08:19.098 --> 08:22.795
Local cops don't care, Scully.
l don't know who does.

08:23.903 --> 08:26.337
OK, l care, but what are we
supposed to do about it?

08:26.405 --> 08:29.636
Find out what killed Maria Dorantes.
Take a look at her body.

08:29.709 --> 08:33.702
- While you do what?
- Try to find this man, Eladio Buente.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.909
Agent Lozano?

08:42.788 --> 08:46.246
Special Agent Mulder. l'm with the FBl.

08:46.325 --> 08:48.486
The FBl? Here?

08:48.561 --> 08:51.257
We're investigating the death
of a migrant worker.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.354
Really?

08:52.431 --> 08:57.300
Eladio Buente. He hasn't been seen for
three days, and he's not in police custody.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.533
- l thought he might be in lNS custody.
- He might.

09:08.848 --> 09:10.839
Let's see.

09:10.917 --> 09:15.786
OK, we have a José Feliciano.
We have Juan Valdez.

09:15.855 --> 09:20.417
We have César Chávez.
We have Plácido Domingo here.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.859
But l don't see any Eladio Buente.

09:22.929 --> 09:26.592
So you are telling me that
no one here uses their real name.

09:28.534 --> 09:32.903
- What is this man wanted for?
- Possibly the murder of Maria Dorantes.

09:32.972 --> 09:35.338
Oh, man. The Chupacabra?

09:35.408 --> 09:39.174
Yeah. You've heard of it. You don't believe it.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.408
No, l believe these people.
Their lives are small.

09:42.481 --> 09:47.043
So they have to make these fantasies
just to keep on going, to feel alive.

09:47.119 --> 09:51.522
Because they are strangers here.
They feel hated, unwanted.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.856
When their passions become inflamed
they resort to violence,

09:54.927 --> 09:58.886
and then they cannot turn to the law
so they make up these fantastic tales.

09:58.965 --> 10:02.492
Call it anything you want,
but this is an age-old story.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.866
l've heard that.

10:04.937 --> 10:08.896
Let's see if we can find your Eladio Buente.

10:09.842 --> 10:11.503
Excuse me.

10:12.845 --> 10:14.904
- Excuse me.
- Can l help you?

10:14.981 --> 10:18.974
l'm Agent Dana Scully with the FBl,
investigating the death of a migrant worker.

10:19.051 --> 10:21.281
- Juan or Juanita?
- l'm sorry?

10:21.354 --> 10:23.379
Doe. A man or a woman?

10:23.456 --> 10:28.325
Maria Dorantes. l need to determine a cause
of death in order to close an investigation.

10:28.394 --> 10:31.921
lt sounds vaguely familiar,
but l don't think l've got to her yet.

10:31.998 --> 10:36.059
Well, l'm a medical doctor. lf you show me
the body, l could examine it myself.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.126
lt's in the fridge.

10:40.206 --> 10:43.266
l don't think he's going anywhere.

10:44.276 --> 10:46.267
That's her.

10:51.717 --> 10:53.912
Oh, my God.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.449
This must be him.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.198
Why is he segregated like this?

11:08.601 --> 11:11.035
¿Por qué lo tienes segregado?

11:11.103 --> 11:13.594
Los otros detenidos lo molestaban mucho.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.642
Ninguno se le acerca a él.
Le tienen un miedo terrible.

11:16.709 --> 11:22.306
The other detainees were giving him
a hard time. They don't wanna go near him.

11:22.381 --> 11:25.839
- They think he's the Chupacabra.
- That may be.

11:25.918 --> 11:31.254
But l will tell you, with a tremendous degree
of certainty, this guy is not Erik Estrada.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.887
Buente!

11:38.230 --> 11:40.994
El FBl quiere hacerte unas preguntas.

11:42.668 --> 11:45.000
Ask him if he killed Maria Dorantes.

11:45.071 --> 11:47.403
Quiere saber si mataste a Maria Dorantes.

11:47.473 --> 11:48.201
¡No!

11:48.274 --> 11:51.266
No lo hice. Soy inocente.

11:52.745 --> 11:54.508
¡No soy asesino!

11:54.580 --> 11:58.175
- What did he say?
- ''l didn't do it.''

11:58.250 --> 12:00.445
Ask him what happened.

12:00.519 --> 12:02.453
¿ Qué fue lo que pasó?

12:03.756 --> 12:07.624
Un ruido como un relámpago muy cerca.

12:07.693 --> 12:11.891
There was a noise like thunder,
but very close.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.566
And then there was lightning, very bright.

12:17.636 --> 12:21.003
lt blinded me. And l fell to the ground.

12:25.911 --> 12:29.745
And then l felt the hot rain fall on me.

12:29.815 --> 12:33.478
And when l finally could
open my eyes and see,

12:37.890 --> 12:39.949
l saw the dead goat.

12:40.025 --> 12:43.461
And then l saw Maria. Maria.

12:50.102 --> 12:53.697
She called my name... once.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.265
She was lying in a puddle of yellow rain.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.972
Something had eaten at her face.

13:07.686 --> 13:11.178
And l held her in my arms, and then she died.

13:18.330 --> 13:21.788
And then l got up, and l ran screaming.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.858
¡Soy inocente!

13:25.604 --> 13:28.266
This guy is better than Erik Estrada.

13:44.123 --> 13:46.614
What's gonna happen to him?

13:47.526 --> 13:51.929
He'll get his 45 seconds before the judge
and he'll be placed on a southbound bus.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.966
- ls there any way to delay that?
- Why would you wanna do that?

13:55.034 --> 14:00.165
- To try to solve an unexplained death.
- Hasn't the FBl got better things to do?

14:01.307 --> 14:03.241
File your paperwork.

14:03.309 --> 14:07.405
By the time they process it,
he'll probably be back here anyway.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.572
Put him in the front.

14:09.648 --> 14:11.639
Come on. Up front.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.987
OK, vamos. Let's go.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.494
- Did you find Eladio Buente?
- Yeah, l found him.

14:26.565 --> 14:29.329
Did he confess to
the murder of Maria Dorantes?

14:29.401 --> 14:30.868
Not exactly, no.

14:32.238 --> 14:35.605
- Did he tell you what happened?
- Flash of light, yellow rain.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.665
''Maria! Maria!''

14:40.880 --> 14:45.374
He didn't kill her, Mulder.
l examined the body of Maria Dorantes,

14:45.451 --> 14:49.820
and l believe that her cause of death
was natural, albeit strange.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.983
She seems to have succumbed
to a massive fungal infection.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.959
- A fungus?
- Aspergillus, according to the coroner.

14:56.028 --> 15:01.227
lt's a mold that's found in dead leaves,
compost, even household dust.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.234
- And it can kill?
- Not normally.

15:03.302 --> 15:06.829
- lt's very common and quite harmless.
- You don't think that's weird?

15:06.906 --> 15:10.774
Well, aspergillus can be lethal
to people with immunodeficiencies

15:10.843 --> 15:14.210
like AlDS patients and transplant recipients.

15:14.280 --> 15:17.647
l found high levels of methyl bromide
in her blood workup.

15:17.716 --> 15:22.653
lt's a pesticide that's used
for soil sterilization - highly toxic.

15:22.721 --> 15:25.622
Now, l think that her body
was so ravaged by pesticides

15:25.691 --> 15:30.219
that a normally benign fungus may have
compromised her whole immune system.

15:30.296 --> 15:33.754
Still doesn't explain the flash
of light and the yellow rain

15:33.832 --> 15:37.359
- and El Chupacabra.
- Mulder, l know you don't wanna hear this,

15:37.469 --> 15:42.463
but l think the aliens in this story
are not the villains, they're the victims.

15:46.345 --> 15:48.040
Look at that.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.565
Mulder.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.529
What does it look like?

16:42.601 --> 16:47.538
lt appears he died of systemic shock, brought
on by what appears to be a fungal infection.

16:47.606 --> 16:51.872
- The same one that killed Maria Dorantes?
- No, l don't know what this is.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.538
But its speed and aggressiveness
are frightening.

16:54.613 --> 16:58.379
The infection's covered 90 percent
of his body, through both layers of skin.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.350
Did you find him?

17:00.419 --> 17:04.981
We rounded up most of the people who
escaped. Eladio Buente wasn't among them.

17:05.057 --> 17:07.252
No one knows where he ran?

17:07.326 --> 17:09.760
Agent Lozano,
this is my partner, Agent Scully.

17:09.828 --> 17:14.265
They all ran away from El Chupacabra, the
man they say is responsible for this tragedy.

17:14.333 --> 17:18.963
- Eladio Buente didn't kill anybody.
- l'm not so sure about that, Scully.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.598
This is the work of a pathogen
of some kind of a highly virulent strain.

17:22.674 --> 17:26.234
Right now Eladio Buente is the only
connection we have to this death

17:26.310 --> 17:30.873
and to the death of Maria Dorantes, which
is why l need manpower to try to find him.

17:30.949 --> 17:34.783
Manpower? We don't have the resources
to go chasing after one poor illegal.

17:34.853 --> 17:39.051
Whatever you hope to learn by finding him,
we have to first make a classification

17:39.124 --> 17:40.921
of the fungi from the victims.

17:40.993 --> 17:45.089
l need to isolate it, and l need to get a sample
to a mycologist as quickly as possible.

17:45.164 --> 17:50.363
Good. You should do that while
Agent Lozano and l try to find El Chupacabra.

17:56.341 --> 17:59.071
Te molesta que te vea así. ¿No es cierto?

18:00.612 --> 18:02.739
¿Por qué había de molestarme?

18:02.815 --> 18:05.682
- Soy tu mujer.
- Sí, te molesta.

18:08.153 --> 18:10.144
Señor?

18:18.497 --> 18:20.795
- Señor?
- What do you want?

18:24.169 --> 18:26.399
You wanna go back?

18:26.472 --> 18:27.632
¿Estás loco?

18:52.331 --> 18:54.595
How long have you been in this country?

18:54.666 --> 18:57.726
Ni crédito, ni caridad.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.862
Aquí es America, you dumb wet.

19:12.284 --> 19:13.774
Truck stop at dusk.

19:15.387 --> 19:17.514
No dinero, no ride.

19:18.223 --> 19:19.884
¿ Comprende?

19:19.958 --> 19:21.516
Sí.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.759
- Dinero.
- Dinero.

19:56.628 --> 19:59.620
Construction! Construction workers. Dos.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.169
OK. You two, get in the back. Let's go.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.609
l only need two, amigo. Dos.

20:16.682 --> 20:19.583
Hey, outta the truck. l got work to do.

20:25.324 --> 20:27.656
Hey! Where are you going?

20:32.064 --> 20:33.793
You'll have to do.

20:35.300 --> 20:39.760
What you're looking at is the most ubiquitous
fungal spore known to mankind:

20:39.838 --> 20:41.829
dermatophytosis.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.169
Athlete's foot?

20:43.242 --> 20:46.075
A great survivor of countless
extermination efforts.

20:46.144 --> 20:50.376
Historically underrated and unfairly
overshadowed by the popular cockroach.

20:50.449 --> 20:53.748
But our body has natural defenses
against this kind of invasion.

20:53.819 --> 20:57.050
l mean, even in the absence
of an immunoresponse,

20:57.122 --> 21:02.116
a fungi like this one or the aspergillus, don't
they need the right environment to multiply?

21:02.194 --> 21:04.526
Yes, unless they have help.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.163
What's this?

21:12.237 --> 21:16.469
lt's an enzyme l isolated from both your
specimens, but that's about all l can tell you.

21:16.541 --> 21:21.240
- lt's unlike any enzyme l've ever seen.
- lt's not the fungi but the enzyme that kills.

21:21.313 --> 21:24.248
Acting as a catalyst, as an accelerant.

21:24.316 --> 21:30.312
Let me show you.
This is Puccinia graminis. Black stem rust.

21:30.589 --> 21:34.923
lt's been the cause of a fairly containable
crop blight here in the valley.

21:51.343 --> 21:52.367
Oh, my God.

21:54.413 --> 21:58.281
l must say, if this were to get out
into the environment,

21:58.350 --> 22:02.480
dermatophytosis might give
the cockroach a run for its money.

22:02.554 --> 22:04.545
Hm?

22:17.703 --> 22:23.335
He was here, all right. They say he got
into the truck of a foreman named Culver.

22:23.408 --> 22:25.171
Story's out.

22:25.243 --> 22:29.202
Oh, yeah. l told you,
these people love their stories.

22:29.281 --> 22:34.548
lt's the one thing that keeps them from going
mad when they're out there waiting for work.

22:34.619 --> 22:36.985
So they really don't think
he's the Chupacabra?

22:37.055 --> 22:38.647
No, they're certain of it.

22:38.724 --> 22:42.091
- You told them about the fungal infection?
- They wouldn't listen.

22:42.160 --> 22:45.960
They are only interested
in what will become of Eladio Buente.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.898
- What will become of him?
- When his brother finds him...

22:48.967 --> 22:51.299
- He'll kill him.
- Yes, probably.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.134
A man cannot live
with vengeance in his heart.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.197
So we gotta find him first.

22:57.909 --> 23:02.005
My mother used to say that
blood should be left to cleanse itself.

23:02.080 --> 23:06.176
God curses the man
who stands between two brothers.

23:06.251 --> 23:09.584
Well, in this case,
he'll curse the man who doesn't.

23:18.363 --> 23:20.024
Señor?

23:20.632 --> 23:22.497
Señor?

23:22.567 --> 23:24.967
Jefe.

23:25.604 --> 23:28.004
Señor Culver?

23:38.750 --> 23:40.741
¡Jefe!

23:43.121 --> 23:45.316
¡Jefe!

23:57.702 --> 23:59.693
Eladio Buente.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.471
Eladio?

24:40.378 --> 24:42.369
Eladio Buente.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.474
Mátame a mí. ¡Asesino!

25:22.320 --> 25:24.288
Gabrielle!

25:26.725 --> 25:28.716
Gabrielle!

26:02.994 --> 26:04.256
Gabrielle, por favor.

26:21.580 --> 26:22.877
Eladio!

26:25.317 --> 26:27.080
- Mulder, it's me.
- Where are you?

26:27.152 --> 26:31.418
The state university bio department.
Mulder, listen to me. l think you're right.

26:31.489 --> 26:34.322
l think Eladio Buente
is responsible for those deaths.

26:34.392 --> 26:37.384
- Responsible how?
- By spreading an enzyme produced by

26:37.462 --> 26:40.397
what appears to be
a new strain of conidial fungi.

26:40.465 --> 26:43.025
- How's he spreading it?
- My guess is by touch.

26:43.101 --> 26:45.763
l saw this man, Scully. He was unaffected.

26:46.838 --> 26:50.239
He could be just a carrier then,
a kind of Typhoid Mary.

26:50.308 --> 26:53.277
- You're saying it's a new strain?
- Yes.

26:53.345 --> 26:58.248
Mulder, it is extremely important that you
not come into direct contact with this fungus.

26:58.316 --> 27:02.685
- You must not inhale it, touch it.
- Lozano, careful.

27:04.656 --> 27:08.490
Scully, l've been thinking. l know
that's dangerous, butjust bear with me.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.256
These fortean transients -
what the women described -

27:11.329 --> 27:14.662
they could have been caused
by an object falling at a high speed

27:14.733 --> 27:18.499
creating a sonic boom and a flash of light,
what astronomers call a bolide.

27:18.570 --> 27:19.730
A bolide?

27:19.804 --> 27:23.262
Created by a meteorite
or a piece of extraplanetary material,

27:23.341 --> 27:26.333
of which 2,000 tons fall to the earth every day.

27:26.411 --> 27:29.642
This yellow rain - the space debris
could have fallen in a lake,

27:29.714 --> 27:34.447
superheating the water and sending it
skyward, which would mean this is alien.

27:34.953 --> 27:37.080
l think this is beside the point right now.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.646
- And the fungus...
- Let me work on the fungus.

27:39.724 --> 27:43.820
What you need to do right now
is to find the man who may be spreading it.

27:43.895 --> 27:45.385
OK.

27:46.297 --> 27:48.788
So you got your own stories too, huh?

27:52.470 --> 27:54.404
Hey, it's El Barbero.

27:56.808 --> 28:00.710
Hey, Lozano, l hear
you're lookin' for the Chupacabra.

28:02.814 --> 28:06.580
For a modest fee, l can tell you
where he might be found.

28:44.689 --> 28:46.680
Eladio!

28:49.427 --> 28:50.655
Stop!

28:52.897 --> 28:54.888
Don't touch him.

29:03.508 --> 29:05.499
Hey!

29:18.923 --> 29:20.914
l lost him.

29:39.744 --> 29:41.678
More goats.

29:44.682 --> 29:49.119
Agent Lozano.
How does this man keep eluding us?

29:49.187 --> 29:52.816
These people are invisible.
You look at them and you don't see them.

29:52.891 --> 29:57.521
Just workers, cheap labor
to pick crops and clean houses.

29:57.595 --> 30:00.962
To most people, they're aliens
in the true sense of the word.

30:06.004 --> 30:08.700
- El Chupacabra.
- Calm down.

30:08.773 --> 30:10.764
Calm down.

30:11.075 --> 30:15.034
Can a man do this?
Can Eladio Buente do this?

30:15.747 --> 30:19.649
Eladio, he went to his cousin
Gabriella's house asking for money.

30:19.717 --> 30:23.346
- When?
- Today. He said he killed nobody.

30:23.421 --> 30:27.824
But Soledad, he went to Gabrielle's house
trying to kill Eladio.

30:27.892 --> 30:29.883
Calm down.

30:34.966 --> 30:37.366
- ¿ Quién es?
- Gabrielle Buente?

30:37.435 --> 30:41.166
This is Agent Lozano, lNS. Open up.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.741
- Where is he?
- ¿ Qué?

30:48.813 --> 30:51.748
Don't give me your ''qué.'' You know who.

30:51.816 --> 30:54.751
- Where is he - Eladio?
- He is not here.

30:54.819 --> 30:58.311
Please, l would not let Eladio Buente in here.
You must believe me.

30:58.389 --> 31:01.586
Maybe you should check the back.

31:05.363 --> 31:09.265
- What about his brother, Soledad?
- No.

31:09.334 --> 31:12.565
He is not here! No one is here! l'm alone.

31:12.637 --> 31:14.969
Have you seen either of them?

31:16.541 --> 31:21.535
Sí. But l'm afraid because of
what they say about Eladio.

31:23.147 --> 31:27.607
- About El Chupacabra.
- There is no El Chupacabra, Gabrielle.

31:27.685 --> 31:31.587
Eladio is a very sick man.
lf he comes here, you must not let him in.

31:31.656 --> 31:34.523
lf he comes to this door, call the police.
Understand?

31:34.592 --> 31:40.224
There's nobody. l'm gonna be
watching you, Chiquita. Every move.

31:40.298 --> 31:42.289
- ¿ Comprendes?
- Sí.

32:00.318 --> 32:03.253
- l think we should hold up a minute.
- For what?

32:03.321 --> 32:05.653
Something's going on here.

32:45.563 --> 32:47.793
Hey, José, this ain't no restaurant!

32:47.865 --> 32:50.390
You know you have to pay for all that.

32:54.038 --> 32:57.599
Hey, what the hell do you think
you're doing? Come back here!

32:57.675 --> 33:00.508
Hey, you're gonna have to clean that up. Hey!

33:25.970 --> 33:28.336
- That's our man.
- Eladio Buente?

33:28.406 --> 33:31.398
No. That's his brother - Soledad.

33:43.988 --> 33:46.752
- Bueno.
- Eladio?

33:46.824 --> 33:48.815
Sí, Gabrielle.

34:07.478 --> 34:08.706
Eladio?

34:10.281 --> 34:12.272
Eladio!

34:48.886 --> 34:51.411
Soledad Buente. Stop! Stop!

34:51.489 --> 34:53.821
- Drop your weapon!
- Drop the gun!

34:53.891 --> 34:56.826
- Put it down! Now!
- Drop it!

34:56.893 --> 34:58.521
¡Suéltala!

35:18.282 --> 35:20.273
Sólo quiero vengarme.

35:22.186 --> 35:24.984
- Eladio!
- Cállate.

35:25.056 --> 35:27.388
- Cállate la boca.
- Mulder.

35:29.727 --> 35:32.195
He's been here.

35:51.782 --> 35:54.080
- ¿ Quién es?
- Eladio.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.143
Eladio?

36:38.462 --> 36:40.453
Eladio? Eladio Buente?

36:41.232 --> 36:43.223
He is not here.

36:44.268 --> 36:46.463
He's gone.

36:46.537 --> 36:49.028
- Gone where?
- To México.

36:50.908 --> 36:54.537
- Where he can hide his terrible face.
- How's he gonna get to Mexico?

36:54.612 --> 36:58.548
- l gave him all my money.
- You gave him your money?

36:58.616 --> 37:00.743
Yes, because l was afraid.

37:03.221 --> 37:07.487
l was afraid El Chupacabra would kill me too.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.492
What can l say?

37:12.697 --> 37:15.860
- How are we gonna find this man?
- Good luck.

37:15.933 --> 37:18.424
l'm gonna go process the brother.

37:32.617 --> 37:35.484
You know what she said about Eladio,
about his face...

37:35.553 --> 37:39.319
l don't know what to believe anymore.
These people sure love their stories.

37:39.390 --> 37:44.384
He could be anywhere. lf he were to enter
a metropolitan area with what he's carrying...

37:44.462 --> 37:47.056
- He won't.
- lf he's going to Mexico...

37:47.131 --> 37:51.329
She's lying. lf this man thinks he killed
Maria Dorantes, he won't be going to Mexico.

37:51.402 --> 37:55.202
- Then where is he going?
- Same place as Lozano and Eladio's brother.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.140
- He's gone to face his brother.
- l don't understand.

37:58.209 --> 38:00.336
''God curses the man
who stands between two brothers.''

38:00.411 --> 38:04.438
Get on your cell phone
and have a haz-mat team assembled.

38:18.362 --> 38:21.195
Eladio Buente, come on out!

38:22.500 --> 38:25.025
Be a man and face your brother.

38:25.102 --> 38:27.093
Madre de Dios.

38:29.707 --> 38:31.902
Eladio, no!

38:32.543 --> 38:34.534
¡Párate, Eladio!

39:15.519 --> 39:20.013
They came from the sky. More Chupacabras

39:20.091 --> 39:22.082
coming to save Eladio.

39:24.495 --> 39:30.491
l slammed the door and prayed...
that they would not come to kill me too.

39:31.268 --> 39:36.501
- What will happen to Soledad?
- He was taken up by a Chupacabra.

39:36.574 --> 39:39.509
He will suffer for his treachery.

39:39.577 --> 39:42.444
He is made to suck the blood

39:42.513 --> 39:46.973
of only the sick and dying goats
when the Chupacabra comes to feed.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.019
That's not what Gabriella said.

39:49.086 --> 39:52.852
What does Gabriella know?
l was there. l saw it with my own eyes.

39:52.923 --> 39:57.792
Gabriella said that she lied to la FBl,
so that her cousin Eladio might live.

39:57.862 --> 40:02.322
But la migra Lozano knew that Soledad
could not live with vengeance in his heart.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.391
¡Alto!

40:05.269 --> 40:08.966
Turn around and face the man
whose love you killed!

40:09.740 --> 40:13.073
You killed Maria
because she wouldn't love you.

40:14.512 --> 40:17.140
Because her heart belongs to only one man.

40:19.617 --> 40:24.611
Don't make me shoot you in the back, Eladio!
Turn! See my tears!

40:25.856 --> 40:28.518
- Turn around like a man!
- No.

40:34.765 --> 40:38.667
''Shoot. Shoot!'' la migra shouted.

40:38.736 --> 40:42.194
But Soledad began to cry.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.333
''No. No!'' cried Soledad.

40:45.409 --> 40:51.405
''l cannot shoot my brother.
He is my brother. My flesh, my blood.''

40:51.649 --> 40:54.675
- Shoot him! He's El Chupacabra!
- Shouted la migra.

40:54.752 --> 40:55.912
You cannot let him go!

40:55.986 --> 40:58.784
''He is a goat-sucker and he must be killed!''

40:59.490 --> 41:04.189
Soledad, he could not kill Eladio

41:04.261 --> 41:08.857
because he knew l would never forgive him.

41:12.169 --> 41:17.539
La migra Lozano tried to pull the gun
from Soledad's hand, calling him a coward.

41:17.608 --> 41:20.475
''No!'' cried Soledad. ''He is my brother!''

41:20.544 --> 41:22.034
And the gun went off!

41:22.112 --> 41:23.477
Bang! Bang!

41:24.315 --> 41:28.115
La migra Lozano... fell dead.

41:30.020 --> 41:31.715
Pero no.

41:32.056 --> 41:34.684
La migra Lozano

41:34.758 --> 41:37.750
brought Soledad to kill Eladio

41:37.828 --> 41:40.490
so that he would not be cursed.

41:41.899 --> 41:44.424
So God

41:44.502 --> 41:46.936
cursed Soledad for his treachery

41:48.639 --> 41:51.130
and turned him into...

41:52.343 --> 41:56.109
El Chupacabra like his brother.

41:58.215 --> 42:00.149
No.

42:00.217 --> 42:02.481
Together they run...

42:03.621 --> 42:05.953
to México.

42:10.694 --> 42:13.686
- El Chupacabra?
- Yes, sir.

42:14.532 --> 42:18.468
- Frankly, l'm confused by this story.
- l don't blame you.

42:18.536 --> 42:21.630
We can't exactly explain it ourselves, sir.

42:21.705 --> 42:25.368
At any rate, we arrived
just after the haz-mat team.

42:26.844 --> 42:30.007
They established a perimeter
then secured the area.

42:30.080 --> 42:34.073
An eyewitness was found,
but her testimony was questionable.

42:36.153 --> 42:40.283
The haz-mat team were able to contain
the fungal infection within the camp.

42:40.357 --> 42:42.655
No other casualties were reported,

42:42.726 --> 42:45.695
and we found no other traces
of the accelerating enzyme.

42:45.763 --> 42:50.029
Except on Agent Lozano. We found him dead
with a bullet wound to the chest.

42:50.100 --> 42:53.069
With the fungal infection
already starting to eat away at him.

42:53.137 --> 42:56.595
- What happened to the brothers?
- They were nowhere to be found.

42:56.674 --> 42:59.472
Lozano's revolver turned up ten miles away

42:59.543 --> 43:03.411
near the car of a man
known locally as El Barbera.

43:03.480 --> 43:07.211
Apparently, the brothers paid
this man for a ride to Mexico,

43:07.284 --> 43:10.219
but they didn't get very far.

43:10.287 --> 43:13.916
So these men are still at large
carrying a highly contagious fungus

43:13.991 --> 43:16.960
- that can kill a man in his tracks?
- lt's not a fungus, sir.

43:17.027 --> 43:20.292
lt's an enzyme to which the brothers
had an abnormal tolerance,

43:20.364 --> 43:24.664
and which came from
