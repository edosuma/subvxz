01:34.200 --> 01:35.478
What are you doing
out of bed?

01:55.308 --> 01:57.869

03:00.401 --> 03:01.501
Another step.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.442
We're almost there.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.892
One step at a time.

03:06.447 --> 03:07.783
You're being so brave.

03:07.900 --> 03:10.100
Tell them
I'm a former police officer.

03:10.487 --> 03:12.300
You tell 'em yourself.
Okay, here we go.

03:13.376 --> 03:16.143
No, you can't bring them here.
We're out of beds.

03:16.419 --> 03:18.200
Where I'm gonna
put them, on the roof?

03:18.475 --> 03:20.489
Well, try St. Barnabus.
They might have room.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.600
- What's she doing?
- She's holding up a finger.

03:25.341 --> 03:26.471
The bad finger?

03:26.512 --> 03:28.099
No, Mr. Monk,
the pointy finger.

03:28.100 --> 03:29.548
Good luck.
Can I help you?

03:29.600 --> 03:31.399
Yes, this is Adrian Monk.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.426
M- o-n...

03:32.467 --> 03:33.474
M- o-n-k.

03:33.494 --> 03:34.699
He has a bloody nose.

03:34.700 --> 03:37.009
It's been bleeding all morning.
Yeah, all morning.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.467
- It won't stop.
- It won't stop.

03:38.546 --> 03:39.820
Cause of injury?

03:40.005 --> 03:42.426
I was putting away
my ironing board,

03:42.852 --> 03:45.195
which is normally
a two-person job--

03:45.298 --> 03:47.099
Mr. Monk, it's my day off.
It still is.

03:47.131 --> 03:49.299
An ironing board.
I need your insurance card.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.154
Yes. Fill this out, both sides.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.399
Former police officer.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.683
He's a former
police officer.

03:55.704 --> 03:58.293
I appreciate that, but he has to wait,
just like everybody else.

03:58.334 --> 04:00.283
You and your husband can
have a seat over there.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.413
We're not married.

04:01.715 --> 04:02.999
Congratulations.
Have a seat.

04:08.395 --> 04:09.422
Wait a second.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.371
Hey, wait, wait.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.537
Excuse me.

04:15.198 --> 04:17.500
I-- I was here
before him.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.362
That man has a head wound.

04:19.483 --> 04:20.798
This is a head wound.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.099
That is not a head wound.

04:22.100 --> 04:23.499
Actually, it is,
technically.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.125
You have a bloody nose.

04:25.269 --> 04:27.799
It's a wound,
and it's on my head.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.484
Do you have a dictionary
back there?

04:32.400 --> 04:33.500
What is she doing?

04:34.172 --> 04:35.700
Now it's the bad finger.

04:36.253 --> 04:37.322
Let's sit down.

04:40.794 --> 04:43.118
Yes, I promise,
I will definitely be there.

04:44.293 --> 04:46.500
Okay, let's synchronize
our watches.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.451
I'm allergic
to tetracycline.

04:48.492 --> 04:49.746
Yeah, I know, Mr. Monk.

04:49.943 --> 04:52.799
One dose of tetracycline
will kill me.

04:52.997 --> 04:55.536
Yeah, look, I have it right here.
Allergies: tetracycline.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.351
I will probably beat you there.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.351
I'm right around the corner.

05:01.185 --> 05:03.484
I'm at St. Mark's Hospital.
Emergency room.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.710
Oh, it's not me,
it's my boss.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.200
It's a bloody nose.

05:11.247 --> 05:13.600
I know.
Okay.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.231
Me too.

05:15.992 --> 05:17.101
All right, bye.

05:19.167 --> 05:20.277
Mr. Monk, I need--

05:21.553 --> 05:23.003
There's a light bulb out.

05:23.065 --> 05:24.299
- Yeah--
- Two, actually.

05:24.300 --> 05:25.800
I need to tell you something.

05:25.916 --> 05:28.299
Don't freak out,
but I've made some plans,

05:28.300 --> 05:30.099
and I'm just gonna go
for a couple of hours.

05:31.954 --> 05:34.400
No, you can't leave.
You can't leave me here.

05:34.441 --> 05:37.379
You're in really good hands.
It's a really great hospital.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.747
And I mean, come on,
it's not like it's life or death.

05:39.809 --> 05:40.918
It's a nosebleed.

05:40.980 --> 05:42.199
How can you say that?

05:42.509 --> 05:44.483
I've lost a gallon of blood.

05:44.852 --> 05:47.199
I'm hemorrhaging.
You are not hemorrhaging.

05:47.389 --> 05:50.429
Look, I've already cancelled on this guy
three times because of--

05:51.329 --> 05:52.477
well, because of you.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.567
- You're leaving me?
- Don't say that.

05:54.587 --> 05:57.899
Please don't make me cancel again.
I really, really like this guy.

05:58.001 --> 06:00.266
- You're leaving me.
- I'll be back by 2:30.

06:01.602 --> 06:03.699
- I'm really scared.
- You're always scared.

06:03.820 --> 06:07.691
<i>Yes, but now I'm scared
and hemorrhaging.</i>

06:07.818 --> 06:11.499
Okay, Mr. Monk, come on, please.
I have been on call for 24 hours a day,

06:11.500 --> 06:13.489
seven days a week,
and I'm exhausted.

06:13.900 --> 06:16.800
I mean, it's my first day off
in what, two months?

06:17.081 --> 06:19.387
And this date, this guy--
it's important to me.

06:19.531 --> 06:21.200
Oh, God.

06:23.138 --> 06:24.216
God--

06:24.319 --> 06:26.100
All right, but I mean,
if you really,

06:26.900 --> 06:30.399
really want me to stay,
I'll stay.

06:30.597 --> 06:31.699
I want you to stay.

06:31.850 --> 06:32.889
I can't stay.

06:33.012 --> 06:34.808
Okay, I'll leave
my phone on, all right?

06:34.910 --> 06:36.976
I will be back in just a couple hours.
Okay, bye.

06:53.532 --> 06:55.800
Is it seeping
or oozing?

06:58.900 --> 07:00.399
Okay, Mr. Lam,

07:00.604 --> 07:02.699
you have to sign
right here.

07:03.049 --> 07:04.399
We're sending Mr. Lam right in.

07:04.615 --> 07:06.526
Hello, excuse me.

07:06.664 --> 07:09.952
I have been sitting there
for an hour and a half.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.719
I know, we're booked up,
as you can see.

07:16.041 --> 07:19.144
If I may?
I speak a little Vietnamese.

07:27.858 --> 07:29.974
Yeah, he's saying
that he's feeling much better.

07:30.278 --> 07:32.887
He's feeling fine,
and he would like to go home.

07:34.900 --> 07:36.199
On a city bus.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.169
Right.
Yeah, yeah.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.599
He thinks, uh--
he thinks this man--

07:42.701 --> 07:44.200
oh, yeah,
I guess he means me--

07:44.513 --> 07:46.526
should go ahead of him.

07:46.735 --> 07:47.899
I speak Vietnamese.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.097
- I'll be sitting right over here.
- Yeah, you do that.

07:59.254 --> 08:00.600
A nosebleed, huh?

08:01.732 --> 08:04.156
My stepbrother had the same thing.

08:05.314 --> 08:08.129
It turned out to be
a cerebral hemorrhage.

08:09.231 --> 08:10.800
He was dead in a week.

08:22.457 --> 08:23.939
A cerebral hemorrhage?

08:24.600 --> 08:25.633
Who told you that?

08:25.695 --> 08:29.200
A very prominent patient.
I didn't get her name.

08:30.176 --> 08:34.101
Well, I have
to respectfully disagree.

08:34.163 --> 08:37.799
What you have is a simple rupture
of the olfactory membrane.

08:38.352 --> 08:39.626
Your basic nosebleed.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.099
I think I should be admitted,
just for a few days,

08:43.100 --> 08:45.000
so you can be sure.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.699
I'm gonna cauterize it.

08:46.700 --> 08:47.699
Tilt your head back.

08:47.700 --> 08:48.684
Here's the thing.

08:48.900 --> 08:51.799
She said that her stepbrother
had the exact same symptoms.

08:51.800 --> 08:52.800
And here's the thing--

08:53.728 --> 08:56.194
it feels like
a cerebral hemorrhage.

08:56.657 --> 08:59.188
Mr. Monk, I've seen
a cerebral hemorrhage.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.633
I interned with Graydon Whitcomb
for two years.

09:01.654 --> 09:02.764
Who's that?

09:02.805 --> 09:04.797
- He's the head of neurotrauma.
- Let's call him.

09:04.798 --> 09:06.534
I'll tell you what,
if this doesn't work,

09:06.596 --> 09:08.883
I will take you upstairs
to see Dr. Whitcomb.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.542
Now sit back.

09:11.768 --> 09:15.100
Okay, this might sting
a little bit.

09:17.200 --> 09:21.399
Wait, wait,

09:28.200 --> 09:29.200
All right.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.499
- Okay, wait, wait--
- Mr. Monk, I have other patients.

09:34.710 --> 09:36.601
Can't we just wait
till Natalie comes back?

09:39.125 --> 09:41.571
- Who's Natalie?
- She's my assistant. She's on a date.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.531
Sure.

09:45.481 --> 09:47.918
What time do you think
Natalie will be back?

09:47.995 --> 09:49.947
Uh, probably, like--

09:50.029 --> 09:51.199
There, that's it.

09:51.512 --> 09:53.099
- You're done.
- That's it?

09:56.295 --> 09:57.322
It stopped.

09:59.027 --> 10:01.299
Unless--
Unless I'm out of blood.

10:01.395 --> 10:02.792
That wasn't so terrible
was it?

10:03.100 --> 10:04.100
- No.
- No.

10:06.074 --> 10:08.399
I have to take this.
Can you find your way out?

10:08.661 --> 10:10.199
- Yes, thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:10.300 --> 10:11.800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:12.100 --> 10:13.399
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:13.512 --> 10:14.899
Thank--
Thank you.

10:14.900 --> 10:15.800
You're welcome.

11:00.023 --> 11:01.578
"Whitcomb, 504."

11:41.197 --> 11:42.600
Excuse me,
Dr. Whitcomb,

11:42.883 --> 11:44.899
I know you're busy.
My name is Adrian Monk.

11:46.109 --> 11:48.099
I saw a doctor downstairs,

11:48.160 --> 11:49.989
but I would like
a second opinion.

11:50.856 --> 11:55.089
I thought maybe if I could check in
for two or three days,

11:55.200 --> 11:57.310
you know, maybe you could run
some tests.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.500
Ow, God!
Okay, I'm okay.

12:20.312 --> 12:21.381
Captain.

12:21.636 --> 12:22.704
What do you got?

12:23.204 --> 12:24.912
There may have been
somebody else here.

12:24.985 --> 12:26.248
Look at that blood spatter.

12:26.330 --> 12:27.899
Uh, no, no,
that was me.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.142
Sorry.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.200
- You still bleeding?
- Yeah.

12:31.859 --> 12:32.799
What'd the doctor say?

12:32.800 --> 12:34.599
She cauterized it,
but I don't think--

12:34.600 --> 12:36.999
Sometimes you gotta
cauterize 'em again, Monk.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.674
I used to get nosebleeds
all the time.

12:38.839 --> 12:40.632
I'm not sure
it is a nosebleed.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.100
Well, what else could it be?

12:43.007 --> 12:44.899
That's what I was
gonna ask him.

12:45.115 --> 12:48.066
Captain, I talked to the secretary.
What happened to your nose?

12:50.121 --> 12:51.700
It's okay.
It's all cool.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.331
Yeah, it's all cool.

12:54.645 --> 12:56.022
Monk, as long
as you're here--

12:57.000 --> 12:59.383
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Okay, no problem.

13:10.771 --> 13:11.881
Empty bottles.

13:12.566 --> 13:14.500
He took the pills,
but not the bottles?

13:14.920 --> 13:17.400
There's a drug rehab center downstairs.

13:17.654 --> 13:19.754
We get addicts and junkies
in here all the time.

13:19.815 --> 13:21.895
Security's a nightmare,
but we're a hospital.

13:21.977 --> 13:23.339
We have to keep the doors open.

13:24.563 --> 13:26.104
Why didn't he just
take the bottles?

13:26.990 --> 13:28.700
He wanted us to find these.

13:29.801 --> 13:31.500
He wanted us to think junkie.

13:32.489 --> 13:34.112
Oh, yeah, see there?

13:34.350 --> 13:37.500
He was wearing slippers,
rounded and smooth.

13:38.300 --> 13:39.300
A patient.

13:39.840 --> 13:41.504
Not a junkie,
a patient.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.037
What do you got?

13:50.862 --> 13:51.972
There's powder.

13:54.350 --> 13:55.529
Smells like talcum powder.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.769
Captain, look at this.

14:01.192 --> 14:02.322
What is that?

14:02.692 --> 14:04.316
That looks like a seal.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.700
That could be from
one of our oxygen tanks.

14:08.944 --> 14:10.199
"Room 623."

14:10.389 --> 14:11.400
623.

14:11.800 --> 14:12.799
All right, let's go!

14:12.800 --> 14:15.199
Uh, Lieutenant,
that's the geriatric ward.

14:15.356 --> 14:16.785
If he's a patient up there,

14:16.867 --> 14:18.192
he's at least 80 years old.

14:18.295 --> 14:19.816
Well, then,
we better move fast.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.500
All right, boys, 623.
Let's go.

14:27.198 --> 14:28.300
623.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.000
There's a stain.

14:40.608 --> 14:42.500
Must be a leak
from upstairs.

14:43.044 --> 14:44.299
Would you stand up straight?

14:44.402 --> 14:46.600
It's just a nosebleed,
for God's sake.

14:47.104 --> 14:48.337
I hate hospitals.

14:49.363 --> 14:50.700
Well, let's meet
our suspect.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.400
"Hank Johansen.
82 years old."

14:57.514 --> 14:59.795
He's getting a colectomy
on Wednesday morning.

15:03.423 --> 15:05.500
I think you can secure
your weapon, Lieutenant.

15:12.216 --> 15:13.400
That's a perfect match.

15:13.702 --> 15:16.086
Get the tech guys down here.
We've found our murder weapon.

15:16.127 --> 15:17.195
Yes, sir.

15:19.504 --> 15:21.066
What do you think?
Is he the guy?

15:23.182 --> 15:24.800
Sranger things have happened.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.880
Although, I can't think
of one offhand.

15:29.871 --> 15:30.981
Yes, they have.

15:31.603 --> 15:33.179
- Look at this.
- What?

15:36.390 --> 15:38.321
Looks like it might have
been readjusted.

15:39.455 --> 15:42.435
Seems like it'd be too small
for this guy.

15:43.978 --> 15:45.335
What the hell are you doing?!

15:46.000 --> 15:47.099
Are you trying to kiss me?

15:48.185 --> 15:49.226
No, sir.

15:49.321 --> 15:50.850
Mr. Johansen, hi.

15:50.900 --> 15:53.735
I'm Captain Leland Stottlemeyer.
I'm a homicide detective.

15:53.817 --> 15:54.988
This is Lieutenant Disher.

15:55.416 --> 15:56.600
Who's your lady friend?

15:57.006 --> 15:58.199
This is Adrian Monk.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.499
He's a special consultant.

16:00.685 --> 16:02.199
What happened to your nose?

16:02.304 --> 16:04.299
- You get shot?
- Shot? No, no.

16:04.475 --> 16:07.199
But it is bleeding pretty badly.

16:07.273 --> 16:09.512
I caught a bullet in my nose
in Korea.

16:10.079 --> 16:13.300
It still hurts like a son of a bitch,
but you don't hear me crying about it.

16:13.724 --> 16:14.813
I'm not crying.

16:15.386 --> 16:16.845
But you want to, don't you?

16:17.966 --> 16:19.900
Yeah, he wants to cry.
Yeah.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.400
I'm gonna call you
Soft Serve.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.900
Like the ice cream--
soft and squishy.

16:26.982 --> 16:28.010
Thank you.

16:28.554 --> 16:29.800
Mr. Johansen,

16:30.481 --> 16:33.999
there was a homicide
last night on the fifth floor.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.799
- We're investigating it.
- Good for you.

16:35.906 --> 16:38.899
Sir, a man was beaten
to death with that oxygen tank.

16:39.050 --> 16:40.241
Your oxygen tank.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.847
What the hell
are you talking about?!

16:42.976 --> 16:44.199
Where were you last night

16:44.265 --> 16:46.500
between the hours
of 1:00 and 3:00 a. m.?

16:51.063 --> 16:52.500
Where do you think I was?!

16:52.842 --> 16:53.909
What is this,

16:53.991 --> 16:55.399
your first day with a new brain?

16:55.512 --> 16:56.601
No.

16:57.671 --> 16:58.801
I was here!

16:58.949 --> 17:00.654
Hooked up
to this damn machine.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.753
You see Dr. Scott,
you tell him

17:05.059 --> 17:06.598
I want this thing unhooked.

17:06.839 --> 17:07.969
It's driving me mental.

17:08.275 --> 17:09.672
Who--
Who's Dr. Scott?

17:10.400 --> 17:13.726
Dr. Davis Scott is taking out
half my colon on Wednesday.

17:14.192 --> 17:16.467
And he's the second-best surgeon
in California.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.232
And that's not my opinion.
That's a fact.

17:19.968 --> 17:23.200
Soft Serve,
I know my rights.

17:24.099 --> 17:26.824
And you people can't
just waltz in here and--

17:29.893 --> 17:32.000
Hey, Soft Serve,
come here.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.370
Crime Scene's on their way,
and the floor is secure.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.884
So what do you think?
Do you think somebody came in here,

17:37.946 --> 17:40.638
stole this guy's oxygen tank,
and took it downstairs?

17:41.425 --> 17:42.800
Why would they bring it back?

17:43.204 --> 17:44.600
Why would they bring it back?

17:47.519 --> 17:49.899
It's not possible.
Mr. Johansen never left his room.

17:49.900 --> 17:52.455
He's been on the heart monitor
all night. Here's a cardiogram.

17:52.517 --> 17:55.100
1:00 a. m. to 3:30.
No gaps, no interruptions.

17:55.465 --> 17:59.011
Actually, all we know for sure
is that he never took the monitor off.

18:00.885 --> 18:02.179
What if he took it with him?

18:02.400 --> 18:04.000
- Randy, please.
- No, it's possible.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.200
I mean, all he had to do was
strap the monitor to his back.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.601
And then climb
out the window,

18:09.785 --> 18:10.996
shimmy down one story,

18:11.037 --> 18:14.189
unspooling 600 feet
of wire along the way.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.925
He's 82 years old.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.060
He's a veteran.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.051
They were the Greatest Generation.

18:23.800 --> 18:24.981
You through?

18:25.922 --> 18:28.594
Do you think Mr. Johansen
could lift an oxygen tank?

18:28.686 --> 18:30.207
It must weigh
about 40 pounds.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.517
You might want to ask his
primary physician, Dr. Scott.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.020
- And where is he?
- I know exactly where Dr. Scott is.

18:35.185 --> 18:36.357
Room 694.

18:36.398 --> 18:38.286
Down the hall, to the right.
Follow the signs.

18:38.327 --> 18:39.603
He's been there all day.

18:40.135 --> 18:41.141
All day?

18:41.203 --> 18:42.550
He's a patient in the cardio ward.

18:42.595 --> 18:44.023
He admitted himself last night.

18:45.100 --> 18:47.300
- Thank you.
- It's possible, though.

18:49.053 --> 18:50.399
Well, sounds good, Davis.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.499
You know, Dr. Scott,
we could come back later,

18:52.500 --> 18:54.527
- when you're feeling better.
- No, I feel great.

18:54.548 --> 18:55.760
This is just a precaution.

18:56.274 --> 18:58.399
Last night I had a slight
substernal chest pain.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.833
I checked myself in,
had them run a couple of tests.

19:00.874 --> 19:03.017
- Is everything okay?
- Never felt better.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.113
First good night's sleep
I've had since med school.

19:05.154 --> 19:07.299
You got lucky, Davis.
You gotta tap the brakes.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.440
Thank you, Mother.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.466
Do you seriously think
Hank Johansen was involved

19:11.486 --> 19:12.740
with what happened
last night?

19:12.927 --> 19:14.078
Well, we're not sure.

19:14.733 --> 19:15.904
I can't imagine how.

19:16.260 --> 19:18.699
He has progressive
rheumatoid arthritis in both legs.

19:18.969 --> 19:21.499
So you don't think
he could lift a 40-pound oxygen tank?

19:21.688 --> 19:22.789
Hank Johansen?

19:22.872 --> 19:24.536
He can't even put his own pants on.

19:24.966 --> 19:27.054
And besides, isn't he hooked up
to one of these?

19:27.263 --> 19:28.980
I mean, you'd know
if he left the room.

19:29.165 --> 19:31.599
I heard it was somebody from the clinic.
A junkie.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.399
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Doctor.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.999
Would you mind
taking a look at this?

19:37.000 --> 19:39.199
- Have we met?
- I'm sorry, this is Adrian Monk.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.852
- He's unofficially with us.
- I see.

19:41.997 --> 19:44.402
Well, it's not my specialty,
but as long as I'm here.

19:44.422 --> 19:45.429
You're a lucky man.

19:45.430 --> 19:47.840
Most people have to wait
three months for this consultation.

19:47.861 --> 19:49.999
- Thank you.
- Bleeding on and off?

19:50.104 --> 19:51.400
On and on.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.999
- Does this hurt?
- Yes!

19:54.506 --> 19:55.615
I haven't done anything yet.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.648
<i>It was going to hurt.
I can tell.</i>

19:57.800 --> 19:59.595
Okay, I'm not going
to touch you.

20:00.103 --> 20:01.234
Relax.

20:01.846 --> 20:03.919
Here's the thing.
I went to the emergency room--

20:04.207 --> 20:06.016
Let me guess, they tried
to cauterize it,

20:06.100 --> 20:07.807
- and it didn't take.
- Exactly.

20:07.844 --> 20:09.653
And there was this woman
in the waiting room.

20:09.714 --> 20:11.153
She said that her stepbrother--

20:11.200 --> 20:12.983
- Had the exact same symptom.
- Yes.

20:13.044 --> 20:15.674
And now you've convinced yourself
there's some kind of tumor.

20:15.716 --> 20:17.503
You think it's a tumor?
He said tumor.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.899
He said the word "tumor."

20:18.900 --> 20:20.499
You heard him, and I knew it.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.401
I knew it. I can feel it.
It's right back here.

20:22.442 --> 20:25.399
It's like the size of a basketball.
For the love of God, can I get a room?

20:25.400 --> 20:28.700
- Monk, that's not  what he meant.
- Mr. Monk, you don't have a tumor.

20:29.784 --> 20:32.000
Relax.
Take a breath.

20:33.936 --> 20:37.000
Now, these conditions often have
psychological components.

20:38.158 --> 20:40.398
- Are you under a lot of stress?
- I wouldn't say that.

20:40.439 --> 20:41.487
I would.

20:41.655 --> 20:44.491
Mr. Monk,
I have good news.

20:44.988 --> 20:45.999
You're not sick.

20:46.176 --> 20:47.203
Really?

20:47.540 --> 20:49.200
You don't belong in a hospital.

20:49.410 --> 20:51.699
You belong on a beach,
with your feet up.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.899
- That's a lot of sand.
- Get out of town tonight,

20:53.900 --> 20:55.599
lower the heart rate.
Doctor's orders.

20:55.668 --> 20:56.758
Book two seats.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.399
And, please, take him with you.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.448
Okay, no signs of arrhythmia,

21:00.489 --> 21:02.893
so I'm kicking you out of here.
This bed is for sick people.

21:02.934 --> 21:05.092
Thank you, Bradley.
See you at 2:00.

21:05.233 --> 21:06.899
Well, you're not still
doing your rounds?

21:06.900 --> 21:09.871
I have 18 patients in this joint
a lot sicker than me.

21:10.507 --> 21:11.945
Somebody's gotta be responsible.

21:13.160 --> 21:16.817
Well, it's true what they say.
Doctors make the worst patients.

21:16.898 --> 21:18.029
Good luck, gentlemen.

21:18.100 --> 21:19.116
Thank you.

21:20.195 --> 21:21.510
Did you hurt yourself?

21:23.766 --> 21:25.000
Oh, racquetball.

21:25.959 --> 21:26.999
I missed the shot too.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.099
That's what really hurt.

21:28.327 --> 21:29.500
Is that talcum powder?

21:30.200 --> 21:31.266
Yes.

21:31.459 --> 21:32.999
And if you keep over-focusing,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.100
that nose is never gonna
shut itself off.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.445
I have powder on my hands
all the time.

21:37.700 --> 21:39.707
All doctors do.
It's in the latex gloves.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.969
Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen.
If you need me, give me a call.

21:44.853 --> 21:45.901
Thank you.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.056
I think he's right.
It's all in your head.

21:57.117 --> 21:59.604
Not all in my head anymore.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.216
See?

22:03.000 --> 22:03.999
Where's Natalie?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.700
I gave her the day off.

22:06.638 --> 22:07.741
That was nice of you.

22:07.865 --> 22:09.199
Yeah, it was.

22:09.200 --> 22:10.600
You were right.
There's a motive.

22:11.304 --> 22:13.499
Dr. Scott's being sued for malpractice.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.065
The late Dr. Whitcomb
was scheduled to testify against him.

22:16.189 --> 22:17.599
- Malpractice?
- Yeah, a year ago.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.780
Scott lost a patient
on the operating table.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.599
Dr. Whitcomb claims--
or was about to claim--

22:22.600 --> 22:25.499
that he saw Scott
popping pills before the operation.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.899
Amphetamines.
He would have lost his license.

22:27.971 --> 22:28.958
He did it.

22:29.263 --> 22:31.071
Dr. Scott,
he's the guy.

22:31.409 --> 22:32.533
Was it the talcum powder?

22:32.595 --> 22:33.622
The powder,

22:33.663 --> 22:36.400
plus the bruise on his leg.

22:36.991 --> 22:38.499
It was still swollen.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.199
Had to be less than a day old.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.034
Well, that could have been
from racquetball.

22:42.075 --> 22:44.100
No, I don't think so.

22:44.757 --> 22:47.399
I think he hit his leg
on the coffee table

22:47.825 --> 22:50.100
in Dr. Whitcomb's office.

22:50.830 --> 22:52.000
I hit it too.

22:53.045 --> 22:54.154
Look.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.200
See?

22:56.300 --> 22:58.600
It's in the exact
same spot.

22:59.049 --> 23:00.900
And, Randy, you hit it.
Remember?

23:02.000 --> 23:03.046
Well, let's see it.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.093
What are you doing?

23:06.677 --> 23:08.660
- Showing you the bruise.
- What's he doing?

23:09.345 --> 23:11.708
It's near your ankle.
Just pull up your pant leg.

23:12.009 --> 23:12.999
Well, six of one, right?

23:13.000 --> 23:15.099
It's not six of one.
Roll up your pant leg.

23:15.100 --> 23:16.199
I'm already unbuckled.

23:17.156 --> 23:18.400
Okay, fine.

23:25.488 --> 23:28.800
See, Dr. Scott was in
that office last night.

23:29.088 --> 23:31.553
He was killing Dr. Whitcomb.

23:31.800 --> 23:32.600
How?

23:32.734 --> 23:34.296
I mean, I talked
to the security guard

23:34.358 --> 23:36.200
who was sitting in front
of Dr. Scott's room.

23:36.757 --> 23:38.599
He said no one went in
or went out all night.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.099
- He did it.
- Plus, he was hooked up

23:40.140 --> 23:42.893
- to that heart monitor.
- I don't know how he did it,

23:43.284 --> 23:44.416
but he did it.

23:44.724 --> 23:45.936
He's the guy.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.768
Nice and steady heartbeat
all night long.

23:57.830 --> 23:58.981
He never left his room.

23:59.909 --> 24:01.699
First Mr. Johansen, now Dr. Scott.

24:01.700 --> 24:03.566
Are you gonna want EKGs
on all our patients?

24:05.319 --> 24:07.292
No, ma'am,
that will not be necessary.

24:09.439 --> 24:10.999
Okay, all right, look.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.400
Okay, all right, Captain.

24:12.500 --> 24:15.099
Captain, listen.
I have an idea.

24:15.387 --> 24:18.099
Okay, Dr. Scott was hooked up
to the heart monitor, right?

24:18.100 --> 24:19.197
Yeah, that's right.

24:19.279 --> 24:22.500
What if he took the monitor with him?

24:22.591 --> 24:25.653
What if he hooked it up to a battery
pack, and he just carried it with him?

24:25.673 --> 24:27.584
The security guard said
he never left the room.

24:27.625 --> 24:29.906
Out the window.
It's only one floor.

24:30.685 --> 24:32.013
- Interesting.
- Interesting?

24:32.095 --> 24:33.528
It's worth considering.

24:33.913 --> 24:36.651
I said the exact same thing
a half an hour ago about the old guy,

24:36.692 --> 24:38.993
- and you shot me down.
- You didn't say the same thing.

24:39.014 --> 24:40.760
You said something
about a spool of cable.

24:40.801 --> 24:41.834
800 feet of cable--

24:41.855 --> 24:44.119
It was the same basic idea,
except for the battery.

24:44.510 --> 24:46.538
The battery is a big part
of what Monk is saying.

24:46.579 --> 24:47.599
No, it's the same thing.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.999
What, if I say something,
it's a punch line,

24:50.000 --> 24:51.191
if he says it,
he's a genius?

24:51.211 --> 24:53.499
Would you explain to him
what you mean about the battery?

24:53.500 --> 24:54.616
All right, listen.

24:55.565 --> 24:59.716
Okay, he's a doctor, right?
So, okay,

25:00.592 --> 25:02.600
the monitor--
the monitor--

25:04.318 --> 25:05.799
Okay, I got nothin',
all right?

25:05.800 --> 25:08.129
Okay?
We're both wrong.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.224
All right, he couldn't have
taken it with him.

25:10.265 --> 25:12.237
But there's gotta be
something else.

25:12.300 --> 25:15.100
I'm sorry, Captain.
It's this damn tumor.

25:15.851 --> 25:17.400
I'm losing a lot of blood here.

25:22.589 --> 25:23.781
Okay, let's move on.

25:25.151 --> 25:27.399
Randy and I are gonna
go down to security again,

25:27.400 --> 25:28.899
and review surveillance tapes.

25:28.900 --> 25:30.727
- What about me?
- You're going home.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.899
- What?!
- Monk, maybe you're right.

25:33.100 --> 25:35.905
Maybe the guy is the guy.
But he's also a doctor,

25:35.933 --> 25:37.799
and he gave you
some very good advice.

25:37.800 --> 25:40.017
You need to go home,
you need to relax.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.199
You need to turn your brain off.

25:43.127 --> 25:44.300
I can't. I can't.

25:45.268 --> 25:46.357
Go home.

25:48.500 --> 25:49.578
Come on.

25:56.983 --> 25:58.013
Something from the bar?

25:58.260 --> 25:59.328
Oh, no, thanks.

25:59.779 --> 26:00.804
What happened to your--

26:00.824 --> 26:03.707
I slipped in the shower
and sprained my wrist. No big deal.

26:03.800 --> 26:06.200
- Oh, and they're making you work?
- What was I gonna do?

26:06.300 --> 26:08.045
They didn't have anybody
to cover for me.

26:08.274 --> 26:09.599
The boss is a pretty decent guy.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.268
I didn't just want to leave him hanging.

26:11.416 --> 26:13.142
I'll be back to check on you
in a minute.

26:48.438 --> 26:49.399
Hello, Shelly.

26:49.489 --> 26:51.009
- Dr. Scott.
- Did you miss me?

26:51.213 --> 26:52.446
They told me you were sick.

26:52.487 --> 26:55.099
Don't worry about me, darling.
I am the Rock of Gibraltar.

26:55.192 --> 26:56.260
So are you.

26:56.501 --> 26:58.001
I brought some friends with me.

26:58.502 --> 27:00.700
The best and the brightest.

27:01.141 --> 27:03.100
Or so I'm told.
Mr. Collins, you're up.

27:04.251 --> 27:06.109
She's your patient.
What do you see?

27:06.628 --> 27:09.299
Okay,
rebound tenderness,

27:09.300 --> 27:11.800
- lukocytosis--
- Your diagnosis, Doctor.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.363
A cute diverticulitis.

27:15.353 --> 27:18.405
Congratulations, Mr. Collins,
you just killed my favorite patient.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.541
Mr. Collins,

27:20.624 --> 27:23.199
has conveniently overlooked
her persistent fever,

27:23.494 --> 27:25.950
and right lower-quadrant pain,
indicating what?

27:27.493 --> 27:29.600
- Indicating what?!
- Appendicitis.

27:31.319 --> 27:33.292
We may have a doctor
in the house after all.

27:34.500 --> 27:35.599
Any questions?

27:35.600 --> 27:36.655
Yes, I have a question.

27:39.600 --> 27:40.999
I thought I sent you home.

27:41.225 --> 27:43.486
I had some unfinished business.

27:43.903 --> 27:46.700
This is Mr. Adrian Monk.
He's with the police department.

27:47.279 --> 27:49.991
I'm sure you all heard about
what happened to Graydon Whitcomb?

27:50.300 --> 27:51.948
Could you take a look at this, Doctor?

27:52.383 --> 27:53.799
This is from an EKG.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.699
Yes, I think I've seen
one or two of these.

27:55.700 --> 27:57.199
Well, this was from last night.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.772
Midnight to 3:00 a. m.

27:59.297 --> 28:02.811
There are some gaps
here and here.

28:03.793 --> 28:06.000
It looks like it was disconnected.

28:06.523 --> 28:08.700
Eva, explain these gaps to Mr. Monk.

28:11.805 --> 28:13.900
There are gaps like these in any EKG.

28:14.322 --> 28:17.468
Anytime a patient
rolls over or changes position.

28:17.633 --> 28:18.847
Well, what about this one?

28:19.097 --> 28:21.700
How long is this gap right here?

28:22.400 --> 28:23.900
8 seconds, maybe ten.

28:24.735 --> 28:26.099
10 seconds.

28:26.334 --> 28:27.800
Not much help, is it?

28:30.000 --> 28:31.066
What's going on?

28:31.313 --> 28:32.649
It's almost too absurd.

28:33.196 --> 28:35.100
You remember my patient
Hank Johansen?

28:36.400 --> 28:37.575
82 years old,

28:37.658 --> 28:39.600
osteoarthritis, kidney failure.

28:40.235 --> 28:43.100
He is Detective Monk's
number one suspect.

28:43.789 --> 28:45.499
I think that may not
be blood, Mr. Monk.

28:45.500 --> 28:47.300
I think you may be losing
cranial fluid.

28:49.295 --> 28:50.500
Yeah, actually,

28:51.600 --> 28:52.999
I have a different suspect.

28:53.124 --> 28:54.399
Well, that's a relief.

28:54.603 --> 28:55.999
This one had a motive.

28:56.257 --> 29:00.223
The victim was about to testify
against him in a malpractice suit.

29:01.700 --> 29:04.894
I hope your new suspect wasn't hooked up
to a heart monitor too.

29:05.500 --> 29:08.900
Because that would mean
he couldn't possibly have done it.

29:10.024 --> 29:11.072
Am I right?

29:12.515 --> 29:14.587
It would also mean
you're wasting my time.

29:14.689 --> 29:17.199
Your time may not
mean much, Mr. Monk,

29:17.372 --> 29:19.221
but my time in this hospital

29:19.704 --> 29:21.000
is a precious commodity.

29:21.784 --> 29:23.100
Go bleed somewhere else.

29:23.300 --> 29:24.316
Excuse me.

29:33.292 --> 29:34.401
I'm out.

29:41.700 --> 29:43.000
Oh, sorry.

29:43.430 --> 29:44.499
Don't mind me.

30:05.306 --> 30:06.499
There's a stain.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.860
Yeah, there's a leak upstairs.

30:08.443 --> 30:11.199
I saw the same stain
in another room.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.039
They're probably connected,
or used to be.

30:13.101 --> 30:15.402
A lot of these rooms
were divided up a few years back.

30:15.690 --> 30:17.500
Not my problem,
that's all I know.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.689
Soft Serve!

30:53.750 --> 30:55.490
What the hell are you doing
in my closet?!

30:56.100 --> 30:57.369
How long you been in there?!

30:57.727 --> 30:58.734
That's it.

30:58.964 --> 31:01.183
After my operation, it's go time.

31:01.521 --> 31:03.021
In the parking lot,
you and me.

31:03.068 --> 31:04.075
Mr. Johansen,

31:04.650 --> 31:06.408
who assigned you to this room?

31:06.490 --> 31:08.900
None of your damn business, you moron.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.572
Now, where's my wallet?

31:11.233 --> 31:12.599
What did you do
with my wallet?

31:12.600 --> 31:15.399
Sir, please!
This is very important.

31:15.434 --> 31:18.099
I am investigating
a homicide here.

31:18.100 --> 31:20.299
If you touched my wallet,
so help me, God,

31:20.300 --> 31:22.424
you're gonna be bleeding
from more than your nose.

31:22.465 --> 31:23.699
It was Dr. Scott, wasn't it?

31:23.700 --> 31:24.999
As a matter of fact it was.

31:25.156 --> 31:26.476
There was a waiting list,

31:26.558 --> 31:28.818
and he had to pull
a lot of strings to get me in here.

31:28.860 --> 31:30.092
Oh, there it is.

31:31.859 --> 31:35.311
12, 13, 14.

31:35.912 --> 31:37.063
Okay.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.399
You're a lucky son of a bitch.

31:39.400 --> 31:41.468
Mr. Johansen,
listen to me!

31:42.300 --> 31:45.200
Dr. Scott killed Dr. Whitcomb.

31:45.916 --> 31:47.231
And I know how he did it.

31:47.736 --> 31:49.647
<i>He checked himself in
as a patient.</i>

31:49.774 --> 31:51.007
<i>He knew this hospital.</i>

31:51.069 --> 31:52.754
<i>He knew there had been
a renovation.</i>

31:52.815 --> 31:54.999
<i>So he made sure
that at one time,</i>

31:55.149 --> 31:57.677
<i>his room was connected
to your room.</i>

31:58.400 --> 32:00.400
<i>At about 2:00,
he made his move.</i>

32:01.022 --> 32:03.899
<i>He came in here
through the supply closet.</i>

32:04.000 --> 32:05.298
<i>He knew you'd be sleeping.</i>

32:05.357 --> 32:07.366
<i>He probably prescribed your sedatives.</i>

32:07.427 --> 32:08.742
<i>As a matter of fact, he did.</i>

32:09.700 --> 32:12.232
<i>Then he put his monitor
on your chest.</i>

32:12.300 --> 32:14.099
<i>He took the oxygen tank,</i>

32:14.100 --> 32:15.800
<i>and then he went
downstairs.</i>

32:17.523 --> 32:19.800
<i>After the murder,
he came back here,</i>

32:20.100 --> 32:21.943
<i>put his monitor back on,</i>

32:22.169 --> 32:24.100
<i>and snuck back
into his room.</i>

32:24.400 --> 32:25.499
<i>It was perfect.</i>

32:25.626 --> 32:28.338
<i>Your heartbeat
was his alibi.</i>

32:29.029 --> 32:32.400
So, what do you think?

32:33.416 --> 32:34.792
I'll tell you what I think.

32:36.707 --> 32:38.000
I owe you an apology.

32:38.660 --> 32:41.099
- Really?
- Yeah, that would explain everything.

32:41.187 --> 32:43.699
- Yes.
- You really are a great detective.

32:44.071 --> 32:45.961
But I need proof.

32:46.105 --> 32:49.566
Yeah, that's the thing.
You need proof.

32:49.700 --> 32:50.600
Yeah.

32:55.121 --> 32:56.169
I've got it.

32:57.033 --> 32:58.122
I've got it.

32:59.405 --> 33:02.100
Okay, if I'm right,
which, you know, I am,

33:02.964 --> 33:05.245
for about ten minutes,
during the murder,

33:05.605 --> 33:08.400
your heartbeat,
and Dr. Scott's heartbeat,

33:08.800 --> 33:10.900
are the exact same heartbeat.

33:12.400 --> 33:16.422
All I have to do
is find those cardiograms.

33:16.814 --> 33:19.100
Yeah.
Good thinking.

33:19.688 --> 33:22.300
You better go.
It's very exciting.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.300
Yeah.

33:27.089 --> 33:28.342
I better use the door.

33:36.999 --> 33:38.399
Dr. Scott, please.

33:38.651 --> 33:39.842
Yes, it's very important.

33:41.517 --> 33:44.000
Dr. Scott,
this is Hank Johansen.

33:44.727 --> 33:46.782
You know that
wack-job detective

33:47.213 --> 33:49.000
Adrian Monk?

33:50.719 --> 33:52.500
He just jumped out of my closet,

33:52.813 --> 33:57.200
screaming that you had
killed some guy with my oxygen tank.

33:59.074 --> 34:00.948
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

34:01.030 --> 34:03.233
You better do something
before he hurts somebody.

34:05.185 --> 34:08.164
Yeah, yeah, I know
exactly where he is.

34:30.398 --> 34:31.980
So the judge is laughing,

34:32.100 --> 34:33.998
half the jury's laughing,
and I look down--

34:34.706 --> 34:36.022
I'm still wearing my slippers.

34:36.500 --> 34:37.998
Oh.
Did you win the case?

34:38.000 --> 34:40.300
Yeah.
And now they're my lucky slippers.

34:40.900 --> 34:42.300
I keep 'em in my briefcase.

34:42.692 --> 34:43.739
Clara?

34:43.933 --> 34:45.885
Don't worry, I got you.

34:46.127 --> 34:47.368
I didn't know where you were.

34:47.471 --> 34:49.299
It's okay.
I'm right here.

34:49.530 --> 34:50.639
I wouldn't just walk away.

34:50.989 --> 34:52.304
You know me better
than that.

34:56.474 --> 34:57.542
Alex,

34:57.600 --> 34:59.599
I'm so sorry.
You are so great,

34:59.600 --> 35:02.088
but I have to go.

35:02.481 --> 35:04.100
- You're leaving?
- My boss needs me.

35:04.310 --> 35:05.800
Uh, how do you know.?

35:06.325 --> 35:08.586
He always needs me.
I'm sorry.

36:02.354 --> 36:03.834
You said you wanted
to be admitted.

36:04.237 --> 36:06.200
Your prayers have
been answered, Mr. Monk.

36:07.100 --> 36:08.900
No, you can't speak or move.

36:09.342 --> 36:10.451
Don't even try.

36:10.846 --> 36:12.800
You're literally
wasting your breath.

36:13.700 --> 36:16.894
I've injected 3ccs
of tribusonol into your larynx.

36:17.812 --> 36:20.873
Do you have any idea
what I do here every day?

36:22.400 --> 36:24.336
How many lives
these hands have saved?

36:24.890 --> 36:26.534
How many lives they will save?

36:27.600 --> 36:29.900
Hundreds, thousands.

36:30.600 --> 36:31.696
That's my mission.

36:32.776 --> 36:33.963
It's why I'm here.

36:34.066 --> 36:35.300
I am the miracle man.

36:36.500 --> 36:38.833
Do you think
I would let you,

36:39.300 --> 36:41.075
former-Detective Monk,

36:41.300 --> 36:44.300
or Dr. Graydon Whitcomb--
or anyone--

36:44.842 --> 36:45.992
stop me?

36:53.000 --> 36:55.099
Oh, by the way,
I have some good news for you.

36:55.450 --> 36:57.199
I stopped that pesky nosebleed.

36:57.316 --> 36:58.528
You're welcome.

37:00.099 --> 37:02.627
I have some other news,
not quite so good.

37:03.246 --> 37:05.403
You had an accident.

37:06.100 --> 37:07.713
At least, that's what your chart says.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.399
You were in a stairwell, you tripped.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.719
You suffered a concussion.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.100
Possible nerve damage,
multiple fractures.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.066
Ah, it gets worse.

37:18.100 --> 37:19.400
I don't know how this happened.

37:20.190 --> 37:22.060
The name on this chart
is Dale Butterworth.

37:23.258 --> 37:25.100
In four minutes,
the day nurse--

37:25.400 --> 37:26.800
who is new to this floor--

37:27.202 --> 37:29.500
is going to walk in,
read this chart,

37:30.059 --> 37:33.717
and administer a massive dose
if intravenous tetracycline.

37:34.427 --> 37:36.112
Yes, I know about your allergy.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.827
Unfortunately,
mistakes like this...

37:40.448 --> 37:41.742
happen all the time.

38:02.500 --> 38:04.199
Excuse me, I was looking
for Adrian Monk.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.531
He was sitting right over there.

38:09.700 --> 38:10.725
He's been admitted.

38:11.184 --> 38:12.293
He's been admitted?

38:12.800 --> 38:14.000
He's in Intensive Care.

38:14.300 --> 38:15.500
For a nosebleed?

38:24.500 --> 38:25.500
My God.

38:26.248 --> 38:28.099
Oh, my God, Mr. Monk, I'm so sorry.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.599
I can't believe this.
What happened?

38:30.600 --> 38:32.353
They said you fell down the stairs?

38:33.400 --> 38:36.300
Oh, it's all right. I'm here.
I'll take good care of you, okay?

38:38.900 --> 38:41.099
Hi.
How's he doing today?

38:41.100 --> 38:42.399
I don't know.
I just got here.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.560
- Are you his wife?
- No, I'm his assistant.

38:44.798 --> 38:45.908
And his friend.

38:47.471 --> 38:49.980
I think he's in a lot of pain.
He's not very good with pain.

38:50.021 --> 38:51.450
Okay, well, this should help.

38:59.150 --> 39:00.198
What?

39:02.703 --> 39:04.399
Dr. Scott?

39:04.692 --> 39:06.008
That's his primary.

39:06.069 --> 39:07.900
You're very lucky.
Dr. Scott's the greatest.

39:07.990 --> 39:10.100
Did you hear that?
You have a great doctor.

39:12.188 --> 39:14.835
It's okay, it's okay.
Just relax, I've got you.

39:14.896 --> 39:17.653
Give me your hand.
There you go, just relax.

39:17.961 --> 39:20.163
- He should have some ice chips.
- Okay, I'll get them.

39:23.500 --> 39:24.578
It's okay.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.466
Mr. Monk, I just want to tell you

39:26.569 --> 39:29.199
that I'm so sorry for
leaving you here this morning.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.612
It will never happen again.

39:30.735 --> 39:33.790
If you are ever in trouble,
I will be there for you, I promise.

39:38.321 --> 39:39.575
Okay, let go.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.260
Let go.

39:43.310 --> 39:44.522
I'll be right back.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.799
Nurse, excuse me. I just want
to thank you for being so sweet to him.

39:50.015 --> 39:51.299
But I wanted to ask you,

39:51.300 --> 39:53.819
do you have the kind of ice maker
that makes round ice cubes?

39:53.881 --> 39:55.603
- Because he'd prefer that.
- We might.

39:58.019 --> 39:59.971
So how long have you worked
for Mr. Butterworth?

40:00.012 --> 40:01.225
Who's Mr. Butterworth?

40:12.900 --> 40:13.900
Oh, God.

40:15.700 --> 40:16.700
It's okay.

40:41.552 --> 40:43.915
Take it easy.
One step at a time.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.855
There you go.

40:50.760 --> 40:53.099
You're-- you're scraping the bag now.

40:53.100 --> 40:54.599
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

40:54.600 --> 40:55.666
It's a perfect match.

40:56.316 --> 40:58.577
I'd like to see him try
to explain this to a jury.

40:58.707 --> 40:59.714
It was my idea.

41:00.999 --> 41:02.951
No, it's not, Randy.
It's completely different.

41:03.766 --> 41:05.204
No, it was the same basic idea.

41:06.969 --> 41:09.034
Our next crime scene,
I'm not gonna say anything.

41:09.137 --> 41:11.363
I'm just gonna write everything down
and copyright it.

41:12.076 --> 41:14.700
Yeah, you copyright
everything in your notebook.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.101
Maybe I will.

41:18.500 --> 41:19.899
Son of a preacher man!

41:19.900 --> 41:22.300
- Oh, God, you okay?
- That's bleeding.

41:22.445 --> 41:24.849
- You want to go back inside?
- No, I'm fine. Let's just go.

41:24.891 --> 41:27.777
Mr. Monk, it could get infected.
Maybe we should just go back in there.

41:27.818 --> 41:28.866
Natalie, no.

41:28.887 --> 41:32.399
Can't do running into the E. R.
abut every little thing. Let's just go.

41:32.400 --> 41:33.610
Come on,
let's go home.
