00:16.783 --> 00:18.114
Come in.

00:18.184 --> 00:21.153
Seven of Nine's shipwide
efficiency analysis.

00:21.221 --> 00:23.155
Did we get a passing grade?

00:23.223 --> 00:26.158
Barely. She wants to present it
to the senior staff.

00:26.226 --> 00:27.158
Put her

00:27.227 --> 00:28.159
on the schedule.

00:28.228 --> 00:29.320
We'll be passing

00:29.396 --> 00:30.328
by a Class- T cluster

00:30.397 --> 00:32.729
in the next couple of days- - 
gas giants,

00:32.799 --> 00:33.731
radiogenic sources.

00:33.800 --> 00:34.824
l'm not sure it's worth

00:34.934 --> 00:35.958
altering course.

00:36.102 --> 00:37.501
At the very least,

00:37.570 --> 00:39.561
we should send the Delta Flyer
for a look,

00:39.672 --> 00:42.664
and let's get a full range of
sensor scans as we get closer.

00:45.545 --> 00:48.537
We'll go to a level- 3
analysis of the cluster.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.014
Tom, get the Flyer ready

00:50.083 --> 00:51.641
and assemble an away team.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.413
Harry, start continuous scans.

00:53.486 --> 00:54.748
Kim to Seven of Nine.

00:54.821 --> 00:56.220
Proceed, Ensign.

00:56.289 --> 00:58.757
Any chance you can increase
radiogenic resolution

00:58.825 --> 01:00.122
in the long- range sensors?

01:00.193 --> 01:02.252
The Captain wants
to get a cleaner look

01:02.328 --> 01:04.489
at that cluster
coming up off starboard.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.088
Acknowledged.

01:08.668 --> 01:11.398
Take these specifications
to Lieutenant Torres.

01:11.504 --> 01:12.801
Right away.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.717
Deck 1 1.

01:33.893 --> 01:35.827
What's our Borg queen want now?

01:35.895 --> 01:39.763
We need to route at least
another five terawatts

01:39.833 --> 01:41.596
to the sensor array.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.131
Deck 15.

01:56.583 --> 01:57.948
Hello.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.715
Sorry to interrupt.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.383
l'm about to disprove

02:06.459 --> 02:09.895
Schlezholt's theory
of multiple big bangs.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.555
Of course, l had to demolish

02:11.631 --> 02:13.565
Wang's second postulate
to do it.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.863
Power transfer requisition.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.336
You're standing in the way
of cosmological history.

02:19.405 --> 02:22.602
The cosmos is
16 billion years old.

02:22.675 --> 02:25.769
lt can wait another few minutes.

02:32.685 --> 02:35.882
Schlezholt would thank you
for the reprieve.

04:40.513 --> 04:44.449
Captain's Log, Stardate 537 53.2.

04:44.517 --> 04:46.951
Long- range scans
of the T- cluster have indicated

04:47.020 --> 04:48.954
a number
of tantalizing anomalies.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.785
The away team should have
a field day.

04:50.857 --> 04:53.951
Who knows?
l may even join them myself.

04:55.528 --> 04:56.790
Billy...

04:56.863 --> 04:58.455
Mm...

04:58.531 --> 05:01.659
Billy, wake up.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.326
What do you want?

05:03.436 --> 05:04.994
l need help.

05:05.104 --> 05:06.036
Good night.

05:06.105 --> 05:08.972
Billy, don't you dare
go back to sleep.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.807
What's the problem?

05:12.879 --> 05:14.574
l'm in trouble.

05:14.647 --> 05:15.773
Go to sleep.

05:15.848 --> 05:17.281
Help me first.

05:18.351 --> 05:19.818
With what?

05:19.886 --> 05:21.683
This level- 3 sensor analysis.

05:21.754 --> 05:24.746
l've got four hours of subspace
infrared to interpret.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.657
Long- range scans
on that cluster up ahead?

05:27.727 --> 05:28.659
Yes.

05:28.728 --> 05:29.660
lt's too complicated

05:29.729 --> 05:30.821
to do over the com.

05:30.897 --> 05:33.457
Either we meet in the Mess Hall,
or we wait until tomorrow.

05:34.634 --> 05:35.658
l don't want to get dressed,

05:35.768 --> 05:36.894
and it can't wait
until tomorrow.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.061
Your only options.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.268
l've given operations
an efficiency rating of 7 6

05:44.344 --> 05:46.209
out of a possible 100.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.769
Not exactly flying colors.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.474
The crewmen you assign

05:49.549 --> 05:50.948
to the night shift
are frequently left

05:51.017 --> 05:52.882
with little to do once the
ship's course has been

05:52.952 --> 05:53.884
locked in.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.614
The devil finds work
for idle hands.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.178
Religious metaphors

05:57.256 --> 05:58.450
are irrelevant.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.788
Perhaps you should consider
assigning them additional tasks.

06:02.228 --> 06:05.925
What's this l'm guilty of:
''failure to utilize expertise''?

06:09.402 --> 06:11.165
Crewman Mortimer Harren.

06:11.270 --> 06:13.795
He has five advanced degrees

06:13.906 --> 06:14.998
in theoretical cosmology,

06:15.108 --> 06:18.202
but you've assigned him
to the... Plasma Relay Room.

06:18.277 --> 06:20.108
His talents could be put
to better use.

06:20.179 --> 06:21.271
B'Elanna?

06:21.347 --> 06:23.281
Believe me, l've tried.

06:23.349 --> 06:24.543
When l give him
more responsibility,

06:24.617 --> 06:25.709
he doesn't do the work.

06:25.785 --> 06:28.253
Harren wants to be
down on Deck 15.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.221
lt gives him more
time to repostulate

06:30.289 --> 06:31.688
the origins of the universe.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.157
As you can see,

06:33.226 --> 06:35.353
security is functioning
at near- perfect efficiency.

06:35.428 --> 06:36.759
However, Commander,

06:36.829 --> 06:39.821
if you arrange the phasers
in the weapons lockers

06:39.899 --> 06:42.026
so that the smaller rifles
were in front, they could be

06:42.135 --> 06:44.035
more easily removed
in the event of an emergency.

06:44.103 --> 06:47.004
l'll look into it.

06:48.374 --> 06:50.774
Crewman William Telfer.

06:50.843 --> 06:53.277
Billy. He certainly
ruined my score.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.780
He visits the Sick Bay
almost once a week

06:55.848 --> 06:57.281
complaining of illness.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.342
lnvariably, you examine him
and find nothing wrong.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.285
Mr. Telfer is a hypochondriac.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.822
l'd treat him for it,

07:03.956 --> 07:05.821
but he's afraid of medication.

07:05.892 --> 07:07.325
Have you tried counseling?

07:07.393 --> 07:08.951
He's afraid of that, too.

07:09.028 --> 07:11.997
All l can do is scan him
and offer him reassurance.

07:12.064 --> 07:14.055
Wasting your time
and medical resources.

07:15.334 --> 07:16.232
What about Astrometrics?

07:16.335 --> 07:17.825
Looks like you could use
some improvement

07:17.937 --> 07:19.632
yourself, Seven.

07:19.739 --> 07:22.299
You're correct, unfortunately.

07:23.676 --> 07:27.373
Tal Celes,
Sensor Analyst, grade- 3.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.438
Her work must be
constantly double- checked.

07:29.515 --> 07:31.881
She should be removed from
Astrometrics and reassigned

07:31.984 --> 07:34.509
elsewhere- - perhaps
to Engineering.

07:34.587 --> 07:38.523
Forget it. l've got my own
problems to fix, remember?

07:38.591 --> 07:40.525
That'll be all, Seven.
Thank you.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.929
Dismissed.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.566
Captain?

07:50.670 --> 07:55.039
They've never been
on an away mission.

07:55.107 --> 07:57.769
Mortimer Harren...

07:57.844 --> 08:01.746
William Telfer, Tal Celes- - 
none of them.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.578
They get off the ship
whenever we have general leave.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.584
l mean a working away mission.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.347
Harren never volunteers,

08:08.421 --> 08:11.447
Celes can't get past
the proficiency requirements,

08:11.524 --> 08:14.789
and Telfer always seems
to get a note from his doctor.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.556
Something's got to be done
about this.

08:16.629 --> 08:17.561
What can we do?

08:17.630 --> 08:18.824
There are always a few

08:18.898 --> 08:21.230
who don't make it past
their first year on a starship.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.824
Normally, they're reassigned.

08:22.969 --> 08:26.370
But in our case, maybe we
should relieve them of duty

08:26.439 --> 08:28.202
and let them pursue
their own interests.

08:28.274 --> 08:30.435
lt certainly wouldn't hurt
general efficiency.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.638
They aren't drones, Chakotay.
We can't just deactivate them.

08:35.081 --> 08:37.241
ls the Delta Flyer ready?

08:37.316 --> 08:40.649
Flight- checked with provisions
for a 72- hour away mission.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.485
What have you got in mind,
Captain?

08:48.928 --> 08:52.830
Three people have slipped
through the cracks on my ship.

08:52.899 --> 08:55.834
That makes it my problem.

09:02.508 --> 09:03.702
The analytical aspects

09:03.776 --> 09:06.244
of the subspace infrared
algorithm are fourfold.

09:06.312 --> 09:08.439
Unfortunately, l have
a threefold brain.

09:08.514 --> 09:10.175
You just have
to break it down.

09:10.249 --> 09:12.809
Think of it
as four smaller algorithms.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.375
Okay. But what's the sequence?

09:14.453 --> 09:15.385
lt's...

09:15.454 --> 09:16.944
Zero- G ls Fun.

09:17.023 --> 09:18.581
As you were.

09:21.027 --> 09:24.656
Zeta particle derivation.
Gamma wave frequency.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.221
lon distribution.
Flow rate of positrons.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.825
Z.G.l.F.- - Zero- G ls Fun.

09:30.002 --> 09:32.095
That's how you remember
the sequence.

09:32.204 --> 09:33.671
Thank you, Captain.

09:33.773 --> 09:35.263
- l'll try.
- Good...

09:35.374 --> 09:37.604
because where we're headed,
you're going to need it.

09:37.677 --> 09:39.144
l'll be briefing you
this afternoon

09:39.245 --> 09:40.837
in Astrometrics.

09:40.913 --> 09:44.508
We'll leave first thing
in the morning.

09:53.693 --> 09:55.490
Deck 15.

10:15.314 --> 10:17.475
Captain on the deck!

10:17.550 --> 10:19.040
At ease.

10:21.921 --> 10:23.286
Junction Room 16?

10:23.356 --> 10:24.448
Over there, Captain.

10:24.523 --> 10:25.490
Of course.

10:27.526 --> 10:30.825
Crewman Mitchell,
how have you been?

10:31.897 --> 10:33.762
Uh, never better, ma'am.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.266
Yourself?

10:35.368 --> 10:39.304
Not bad. Not bad at all.

10:43.509 --> 10:44.976
Uh, to the left, ma'am.

10:45.111 --> 10:47.136
Thank you.

10:56.922 --> 10:58.355
Crewman Harren.

10:59.425 --> 11:02.258
Captain Janeway... are you lost?

11:02.328 --> 11:04.819
l was, for a minute.

11:04.897 --> 11:07.491
l'll be briefing you
this afternoon.

11:09.468 --> 11:11.436
Well, there's been a mistake.

11:11.537 --> 11:13.061
Excuse me?

11:13.172 --> 11:15.572
You have me assigned
to an away mission.

11:15.641 --> 11:18.701
l have my duties here.
l'd prefer not to leave my post.

11:18.778 --> 11:20.507
Ensign Culhane
will cover for you.

11:20.579 --> 11:22.513
The preflight schedule
is all there.

11:24.216 --> 11:28.277
lf this is charity, Captain,
l don't want it.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.152
l didn't ask you what you want.

11:31.223 --> 11:32.884
l'm taking the Delta Flyer

11:32.958 --> 11:34.949
on an astronomical
survey mission,

11:35.094 --> 11:36.891
and your expertise is needed.

11:36.962 --> 11:39.192
What do you know
about my expertise?

11:39.265 --> 11:41.893
As much as l need to.

11:41.967 --> 11:44.458
Well, then you might be
interested to know

11:44.570 --> 11:45.901
that l'm about to disprove

11:45.971 --> 11:48.235
Schlezholt's theory
of multiple big bangs.

11:48.307 --> 11:49.774
Really?

11:49.875 --> 11:53.003
Wang's second postulate has more
lives than a cat, doesn't it?

11:53.079 --> 11:54.944
Once you think
you've eliminated it,

11:55.014 --> 11:56.504
bam, it pops up again.

11:56.582 --> 11:58.573
l'll give you a hand,
if you'd like,

11:58.651 --> 12:01.677
when the away mission is over.

12:16.836 --> 12:18.303
Once we reach the cluster,

12:18.370 --> 12:20.395
we'll drop out of warp
and maintain

12:20.506 --> 12:21.473
one- quarter impulse

12:21.574 --> 12:23.508
on the sweep through
the protostars.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.339
l'll be piloting
the Delta Flyer.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.708
Celes, you're going

12:26.779 --> 12:28.804
to run an ongoing
sensor analysis,

12:28.881 --> 12:31.179
providing data for
your colleagues.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.547
Mr. Harren, you'll be looking

12:32.618 --> 12:34.085
at subspace particle decay

12:34.153 --> 12:38.112
for anything new we might learn
about star formation.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.521
And, Mr. Telfer,

12:39.592 --> 12:42.152
your job will be to
look for signs of life,

12:42.228 --> 12:43.957
a long shot in this environment.

12:44.096 --> 12:47.964
But if it's out there,
l'm sure you'll find it.

12:48.033 --> 12:49.625
You'll have the
rest of the evening

12:49.735 --> 12:51.703
to familiarize yourselves
with the mission.

12:51.804 --> 12:52.771
Excuse me, Captain.

12:52.872 --> 12:55.363
lf we find a planet,
we're not planning

12:55.474 --> 12:57.442
on exploring the surface,
are we?

12:57.543 --> 12:59.010
That's a stellar nursery.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.909
Any planets will be gas giants.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.106
They may have moons.

13:02.181 --> 13:03.341
Don't worry.

13:03.415 --> 13:05.349
We'll run a complete scan
for pathogens

13:05.417 --> 13:06.816
before we set foot anywhere,

13:06.886 --> 13:08.751
and the Delta Flyer
is fully equipped

13:08.821 --> 13:10.686
to deal with
medical emergencies.

13:10.756 --> 13:12.690
We'll be fine.

13:12.758 --> 13:16.455
Shuttle Bay 1, 0600 hours.

13:16.529 --> 13:17.996
Dismissed.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.936
Celes is unreliable.

13:27.006 --> 13:29.566
Her sensor analyses
will be full of errors.

13:29.675 --> 13:31.609
You could be putting
your lives at risk.

13:31.677 --> 13:33.611
Don't worry, Seven,
l'll check her work.

13:33.679 --> 13:35.613
This mission could be
better served

13:35.681 --> 13:37.342
with a more experienced crew.

13:37.416 --> 13:38.940
No...

13:39.084 --> 13:40.346
not this mission.

13:40.419 --> 13:43.479
Ever hear the tale
of the Good Shepherd?

13:43.556 --> 13:47.048
lf even one sheep strayed
into the wilderness,

13:47.126 --> 13:50.289
the shepherd left the
safety of the flock

13:50.362 --> 13:51.761
and went after it.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.959
So, you're intending
to rescue them?

13:55.100 --> 13:56.829
ln a manner of speaking.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.631
Maybe all it will take will be

13:58.737 --> 14:01.399
some personal attention
from their Captain,

14:01.473 --> 14:03.703
maybe something more,

14:03.776 --> 14:07.542
but l won't abandon
a member of this crew,

14:07.613 --> 14:10.104
no matter what their problems
might be.

14:26.966 --> 14:29.628
Poor guy...

14:29.735 --> 14:31.362
rotting away down on Deck 15,

14:31.470 --> 14:33.836
counting the years
till we get out

14:33.906 --> 14:35.498
of this godforsaken Quadrant.

14:35.608 --> 14:36.768
lt's a shame he doesn't have

14:36.842 --> 14:38.469
a superior officer who cares.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.806
lt's not my job

14:39.879 --> 14:42.848
to make everybody
who works for me happy.

14:42.915 --> 14:45.679
Some people just
don't want to fit in.

14:45.751 --> 14:48.242
l'll bet you haven't
said two words to him.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.618
Two words, exactly.

14:50.689 --> 14:53.123
We collided in the corridor
during a Borg attack.

14:53.192 --> 14:54.819
l said, ''Excuse me.''

14:54.894 --> 14:56.953
Since we were at Red Alert

14:57.096 --> 14:57.960
and about to be destroyed,

14:58.097 --> 14:59.359
l think it was
very considerate of me.

14:59.431 --> 15:00.455
Well, Mr. Considerate,

15:00.566 --> 15:01.658
why don't you go over there

15:01.700 --> 15:05.761
right now and offer
him some encouragement?

15:05.871 --> 15:07.771
His first away mission.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.637
l'm sure he could use it.

15:19.351 --> 15:21.581
Brushing up
on the Delta Flyer specs?

15:24.189 --> 15:25.850
l'm not a mechanic.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.984
Oh.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.927
Then, what are you doing?

15:40.005 --> 15:42.565
Very interesting.

15:42.675 --> 15:45.872
What do you find
most interesting about it?

15:48.247 --> 15:51.045
Your creative use
of the minus sign.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.618
l see you have
a, uh, appreciation

15:55.688 --> 15:57.588
for multivariate analysis.

15:57.656 --> 15:59.817
Maybe you missed
your calling.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.223
lt's a shame.

16:01.327 --> 16:03.852
l imagine it gets tedious
up at the helm.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.364
l enjoy the view.

16:12.604 --> 16:13.832
Well?

16:14.006 --> 16:18.204
l invited him over to watch
our television set tonight.

16:18.277 --> 16:20.404
You don't mind, do you?

16:26.552 --> 16:28.042
Celes, Celes...

16:29.955 --> 16:32.651
Respond. Celes, respond.

16:36.028 --> 16:37.461
You're not sick.

16:37.529 --> 16:39.121
Yes, l am.

16:39.198 --> 16:40.324
No, you're not.

16:40.399 --> 16:41.331
Really...

16:41.400 --> 16:42.332
l am.

16:42.434 --> 16:43.332
We have to sleep.

16:43.435 --> 16:45.699
l can't go on this mission.

16:45.804 --> 16:46.736
Yes, you can.

16:46.805 --> 16:47.737
No, l can't.

16:47.806 --> 16:48.830
- Yes.
- No.

16:48.941 --> 16:49.999
Bye.

16:50.109 --> 16:50.666
Wait.

16:54.446 --> 16:56.209
See?

16:56.281 --> 16:57.213
lt's nothing.

16:57.282 --> 16:58.214
lt's a fever.

16:58.283 --> 17:00.376
Your temperature is
.2 degrees above normal.

17:00.452 --> 17:01.817
That's right.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.012
A typical deviation

17:03.088 --> 17:05.146
easily prompted by
emotional stress.

17:05.223 --> 17:07.214
Or a multiphasic prion.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.487
You have not been infected
by a prion.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.492
They attach themselves

17:10.561 --> 17:12.257
to the mitochondrial walls,
and they just...

17:12.330 --> 17:13.298
l've already scanned you.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.265
You can barely see them.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.664
They aren't there.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.292
lf they migrate
to my cell membranes

17:18.404 --> 17:20.964
while l'm on the away mission,
they could rupture and l...

17:21.073 --> 17:24.270
Crewman, l am not giving
you a medical excuse...

17:24.343 --> 17:25.776
not this time.

17:25.844 --> 17:28.278
Try to get some sleep.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.975
You shouldn't even have
a medical tricorder.

17:32.017 --> 17:33.279
Believe me...

17:33.352 --> 17:36.048
you'll be so caught up in
the excitement of exploration,

17:36.121 --> 17:39.557
there won't be any time
for worrying about infections,

17:39.625 --> 17:41.593
mitochondrial
or otherwise.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.560
There's nothing like
an away mission

17:43.629 --> 17:46.757
to remind a person
of why we're out here.

17:57.009 --> 17:58.943
l'm going
to one- quarter impulse.

17:59.011 --> 18:01.036
Should l start
the sensor sweeps?

18:01.146 --> 18:03.580
We don't want to miss anything.

18:03.615 --> 18:05.048
Engine status?

18:05.117 --> 18:06.379
Within parameters.

18:06.452 --> 18:07.714
That wasn't us.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.219
Anything on sensors?

18:09.288 --> 18:12.780
.005 fluctuation in
the spatial continuum.

18:12.858 --> 18:15.326
lt looks like simple
background noise.

18:17.796 --> 18:18.728
l agree.

18:18.797 --> 18:20.264
Anybody for lunch?

18:20.332 --> 18:22.061
Are you volunteering, William?

18:22.167 --> 18:23.065
Yes, ma'am.

18:23.168 --> 18:24.100
l'll help.

18:24.169 --> 18:25.397
What would you like, Captain?

18:25.504 --> 18:26.436
Mortimer?

18:26.505 --> 18:29.668
Even my mother
didn't call me that.

18:29.741 --> 18:32.209
Well, then, Mr. Harren,
are you hungry?

18:32.311 --> 18:33.573
No.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.442
Thank you.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.379
l'll have the pasta soup.

18:37.449 --> 18:40.441
lt should be listed
under Neelix 651.

18:40.519 --> 18:42.111
Maybe l'll try that, too.

18:42.187 --> 18:43.882
l'm sure you'll like it.

18:44.022 --> 18:44.886
l'm sure l will.

18:45.023 --> 18:46.684
Thanks for the suggestion.

18:50.362 --> 18:51.852
l'd better get back there.

18:57.336 --> 19:00.134
Neelix 651, two servings.

19:01.773 --> 19:05.209
Neelix 651, two servings.

19:05.277 --> 19:07.871
What's wrong?

19:09.281 --> 19:12.182
The Captain checks
every single thing l do.

19:12.251 --> 19:15.220
Oh... that's
just standard procedure.

19:15.287 --> 19:16.652
Then, why isn't it
standard procedure

19:16.722 --> 19:18.155
for you or Harren?

19:18.223 --> 19:20.555
Maybe she's giving you
special attention.

19:20.626 --> 19:22.856
Yeah, because she
knows l need it.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.996
l wish l could go
back to Voyager.

19:27.065 --> 19:29.829
Me, too.

19:29.935 --> 19:32.233
There's always the escape pods.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.771
Can you imagine?

19:36.141 --> 19:38.769
l understand you grew up
on Vico V.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.278
No wonder you became
a cosmologist.

19:41.346 --> 19:44.372
Wildest sky in
the Alpha Quadrant.

19:44.449 --> 19:45.973
So they say.
l've never been there.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.313
Do you really believe

19:47.386 --> 19:49.183
that childhood environment
is more important

19:49.254 --> 19:51.017
than genetically driven
behavior patterns?

19:51.089 --> 19:54.149
Just making conversation.

19:54.226 --> 19:56.717
Conversation filled
with unspoken assumptions,

19:56.795 --> 19:58.194
which l don't agree with.

19:58.263 --> 19:59.890
l'm a product of
my nucleic acids.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.329
Where and how l was raised

20:01.400 --> 20:02.662
are beside the point,

20:02.768 --> 20:05.032
so if you're trying
to understand me better,

20:05.137 --> 20:07.571
questions about my home planet
are irrelevant.

20:07.639 --> 20:10.403
All right, then.

20:10.475 --> 20:12.443
How's your 13th chromosome?

20:12.511 --> 20:16.413
Missing a couple of base pairs
in gene 178?

20:19.251 --> 20:21.310
l signed onto Voyager
because l needed a year

20:21.386 --> 20:22.944
of hands- on experience.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.283
lt was a requirement for getting

20:24.356 --> 20:27.257
into the lnstitute of Cosmology
on Orion l.

20:27.326 --> 20:30.489
lf we hadn't gotten lost
in the Delta Quadrant,

20:30.562 --> 20:32.496
l'd be there right now.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.794
Sorry to have delayed
your career plans,

20:34.866 --> 20:37.494
but all of us have had
our lives interrupted.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.833
That's the nature
of space exploration.

20:39.938 --> 20:40.962
lt's unpredictable.

20:41.106 --> 20:44.132
Which is why l don't
like space exploration.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.679
Stumbling from star to star
like a- a drunken insect

20:47.779 --> 20:49.906
careening toward a light source

20:49.982 --> 20:52.780
is not my idea
of a dignified existence.

20:52.851 --> 20:55.342
Pure theory is all
that concerns me.

20:55.420 --> 20:58.184
Well, l'm not trying
to change that.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.987
l'm simply trying to get
every member of my crew working

21:01.059 --> 21:02.321
to their full capacity.

21:02.394 --> 21:04.055
That includes you, Mr. Harren.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.893
You don't feel responsible,
Captain...

21:06.999 --> 21:08.830
for having three misfits

21:08.900 --> 21:09.832
aboard your ship?

21:09.935 --> 21:11.493
Well, if there's
anything l can do

21:11.603 --> 21:14.071
to help relieve your guilt...

21:14.172 --> 21:15.833
please let me know.

21:15.941 --> 21:19.138
l'll keep that in mind.

21:22.347 --> 21:25.441
Maybe l will join my
colleagues for lunch.

21:25.517 --> 21:28.975
All this exploration
has given me an appetite.

21:39.264 --> 21:42.961
Computer, identify the source
of that spatial fluctuation.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.397
Source unknown.

21:49.074 --> 21:51.008
Red Alert!

21:51.076 --> 21:52.543
Aft section, report!

21:53.578 --> 21:54.943
Report!

22:01.286 --> 22:03.083
Captain, are you all right?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.554
We need to get
propulsion back on line

22:04.623 --> 22:07.023
and figure out what hit us.

22:07.092 --> 22:08.286
What's out there?

22:08.360 --> 22:09.725
l don't know,

22:09.795 --> 22:11.285
but whatever it was,
it tore a plating section

22:11.363 --> 22:12.421
off the outer hull.

22:12.497 --> 22:15.022
90 percent of our antimatter's
been neutralized.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.328
The reaction's cold.

22:16.435 --> 22:17.993
So much for warp drive.

22:18.103 --> 22:19.764
l'm bringing
the impulse engines on line,

22:19.871 --> 22:21.896
but they've been damaged.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.840
We'll be able to do
one- eighth impulse, no more.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.707
That should get us
to the rendezvous point

22:26.778 --> 22:28.609
with Voyager in about ten years.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.272
Think they'll wait for us?

22:30.349 --> 22:31.714
ls the subspace

22:31.783 --> 22:33.944
transmitter on line?

22:34.086 --> 22:35.747
Voyager, this is
the Delta Flyer.

22:35.821 --> 22:37.618
We've been hit
by an unknown phenomenon

22:37.689 --> 22:38.621
and taken heavy damage.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.453
We require
immediate assistance.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.959
Repeat: we require
immediate assistance.

22:43.028 --> 22:46.122
Transmit that continuously
on all subspace frequencies.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.563
Anything on active scans?

22:47.632 --> 22:48.894
Not yet.

22:48.967 --> 22:50.400
lt was a dark- matter
protocomet.

22:50.502 --> 22:52.299
l read a paper
on that phenomenon once.

22:52.404 --> 22:53.393
Written by me.

22:53.505 --> 22:55.973
Well, enlighten us,
Mr. Harren.

22:56.074 --> 22:59.009
l hypothesized
that a tertiary product

22:59.077 --> 23:00.601
of stellar consolidation
would be

23:00.712 --> 23:03.078
a comet- like assemblage
of dark matter.

23:03.115 --> 23:05.049
lt would be attracted
to any source of antimatter

23:05.117 --> 23:06.982
and neutralize it
upon contact.

23:07.052 --> 23:09.885
So, one of these things detected
the antimatter in our warp core?

23:09.955 --> 23:12.116
The term ''detected'' suggests
a consciousness.

23:12.190 --> 23:14.283
This is a mindless
astrophysical phenomenon,

23:14.359 --> 23:15.451
nothing more.

23:15.527 --> 23:17.495
We should eject
our remaining antimatter

23:17.562 --> 23:19.223
or we could suffer
another impact.

23:19.297 --> 23:20.229
l can't do that,

23:20.298 --> 23:22.823
not on the basis
of an unproven hypothesis.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.027
The forces involved

23:24.136 --> 23:25.728
are nontrivial- - 
if we're hit again,

23:25.837 --> 23:27.702
we could lose
our entire outer hull.

23:27.773 --> 23:29.172
Eject the warp core,

23:29.241 --> 23:31.209
and we lose any hope
of getting warp drive back.

23:31.309 --> 23:32.241
l need more evidence,

23:32.310 --> 23:34.175
and right now,
sensors aren't talking.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.611
Maybe they are talking,

23:35.680 --> 23:38.706
but somebody doesn't know
how to listen to them.

23:38.784 --> 23:39.614
You're out of line, crewman.

23:39.684 --> 23:40.946
This isn't the time
to be worried

23:41.086 --> 23:42.280
about her feelings, Captain.

23:42.354 --> 23:43.286
We're in trouble.

23:43.355 --> 23:44.287
Captain, that hull plate- -

23:44.356 --> 23:46.620
it's less
than ten kilometers away.

23:46.691 --> 23:47.851
lmpact from a dark- matter body

23:47.926 --> 23:50.121
might've left a quantum
signature in the alloys.

23:50.195 --> 23:52.220
That's the evidence
we're looking for.

23:52.297 --> 23:53.525
Do we have transporters?

23:53.598 --> 23:54.963
Yes, l've locked on
to the plate.

23:55.033 --> 23:56.898
Beam it directly
to the aft section.

23:57.002 --> 23:58.333
Celes, you're with me.

23:58.437 --> 23:59.870
Continue the repairs.

24:08.013 --> 24:11.608
No sign of burns...

24:11.683 --> 24:13.742
or plasma residue.

24:16.354 --> 24:18.879
lt seems to have been
sheared off.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.585
Download this
into the main computer.

24:31.169 --> 24:32.568
Captain, l'm sorry.

24:32.637 --> 24:33.763
For what?

24:33.872 --> 24:36.102
l thought
that spatial fluctuation

24:36.174 --> 24:38.108
we ran into was
background noise.

24:38.176 --> 24:39.643
Some noise.

24:39.711 --> 24:41.770
l saw the same
sensor readings you did

24:41.847 --> 24:43.610
and came
to the same conclusion.

24:43.682 --> 24:46.242
You don't have to doubt
yourself all the time.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.081
Yes, l do, and you should, too.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.122
You're right to always be
looking over my shoulder.

24:51.189 --> 24:54.056
We all make mistakes, even me.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.149
Every day?

24:55.227 --> 24:58.628
Every time you report for duty?

24:58.697 --> 25:00.221
On Voyager, it doesn't matter,

25:00.332 --> 25:02.197
because nothing l
do is that critical.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.828
Seven doesn't trust me
with anything important.

25:04.936 --> 25:07.200
The crew is protected
from my mistakes

25:07.272 --> 25:09.240
by the people around me, but...

25:09.307 --> 25:11.275
out here l could get us killed.

25:11.376 --> 25:14.504
You went through
Starfleet training courses.

25:14.579 --> 25:17.070
l had to cram for every exam.

25:17.148 --> 25:20.481
At the Academy, l was infamous
for my all- nighters.

25:20.552 --> 25:23.885
Every night?
Because that's what it took.

25:23.955 --> 25:26.048
That's the only way
l made it through.

25:26.124 --> 25:28.820
Not to mention
the sympathy votes.

25:28.894 --> 25:31.260
The conflict on Bajor
worked in my favor.

25:31.329 --> 25:32.853
The Federation was so eager

25:32.931 --> 25:34.125
to have Bajorans in Starfleet

25:34.199 --> 25:37.259
that my instructors gave me
the benefit of the doubt.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.735
So did you, when you accepted

25:39.804 --> 25:40.896
my application.

25:41.006 --> 25:43.065
You showed evidence
of unconventional thinking.

25:43.174 --> 25:44.607
l liked that.

25:44.676 --> 25:48.203
Not everybody would've thought
to retrieve that hull plating.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.248
Well, just don't trust me
with the analysis.

25:50.315 --> 25:51.714
l guarantee l'll get it wrong.

25:51.783 --> 25:53.842
Well, with that attitude,
l'm sure you will.

25:53.919 --> 25:56.911
This has nothing to do
with attitude, Captain.

25:56.988 --> 25:59.115
You and l are wired differently.

25:59.190 --> 26:01.249
To you,
this is nothing but data.

26:01.359 --> 26:05.989
To me, it... it's a monster
with- with fangs and claws.

26:07.566 --> 26:11.024
ln my nightmares,
l am chased by algorithms.

26:11.102 --> 26:13.832
My brain just wasn't built
to understand this.

26:14.005 --> 26:18.465
We can find you
another post on Voyager.

26:18.577 --> 26:22.240
There isn't another post
on Voyager, not for me...

26:22.314 --> 26:25.715
unless you need a waitress
in the Mess Hall.

26:25.784 --> 26:28.878
You know...

26:28.954 --> 26:30.717
there's more to duty
than the ability

26:30.789 --> 26:33.223
to manipulate algorithms.

26:33.291 --> 26:35.555
Everybody on Voyager has showed

26:35.627 --> 26:38.562
a courage far beyond
what l could've expected.

26:38.630 --> 26:40.530
So have you.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.396
lf we were still
in the Alpha Quadrant,

26:42.467 --> 26:45.402
would that be enough
to keep me on board?

26:47.005 --> 26:48.905
l can't answer that.

26:48.974 --> 26:52.239
l don't deserve to be
on your ship, Captain.

26:52.310 --> 26:55.074
And l'm not really a part
of Voyager.

26:55.146 --> 26:57.307
l just live there.

27:03.888 --> 27:06.152
Pressure's increasing.
The EPS relays are fused.

27:06.224 --> 27:08.715
Cut the plasma flow.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.556
Cut the plasma...!

27:14.966 --> 27:17.526
l could've been killed.
What's wrong with you?

27:17.636 --> 27:19.365
Everything.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.702
lf you want something
to fantasize about,

27:22.774 --> 27:24.708
try imagining how it'll feel
if our hull is breached

27:24.776 --> 27:26.437
and we die of vacuum exposure.

27:26.511 --> 27:27.876
Our blood will vaporize,

27:27.979 --> 27:30.277
and our cell membranes
will rupture.

27:30.348 --> 27:32.407
Surely you know the symptoms
better than l do.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.611
Let's not talk about
it, all right?

27:34.686 --> 27:36.244
Nothing disagrees with me

27:36.321 --> 27:38.881
more than having to put theories
into practical use,

27:39.024 --> 27:40.321
but there's no choice,

27:40.392 --> 27:42.451
so pay attention
to what we're doing here.

27:42.527 --> 27:44.893
You can check yourself
into Sick Bay when we get back.

27:44.996 --> 27:46.793
And you can go back to Deck 15.

27:47.866 --> 27:49.390
That's right...

27:49.501 --> 27:50.900
where l don't have
to rely on you

27:51.002 --> 27:53.402
or your intellectually
deficient friend.

27:53.471 --> 27:56.702
At least l have a friend.

27:59.744 --> 28:02.611
Don't you ever get
lonely down there?

28:02.714 --> 28:05.410
ln the company
of my own thoughts?

28:05.450 --> 28:07.816
Never.

28:07.886 --> 28:10.184
l don't believe that.

28:10.255 --> 28:13.224
Spend some time with us
when we get back.

28:13.291 --> 28:15.350
You might enjoy yourself.

28:15.427 --> 28:18.692
A hypothesis
that would require testing.

28:18.763 --> 28:21.391
l'm a theoretician, remember?

28:21.466 --> 28:26.165
Captain's Log, Delta Flyer,
Stardate 537 64.3.

28:26.271 --> 28:28.705
We've been running
on minimal power for six hours.

28:28.773 --> 28:30.331
Still no response
to our distress call,

28:30.442 --> 28:33.377
and no answers from
the computer on what hit us.

28:33.445 --> 28:35.470
For now, it looks like
we're on our own.

28:35.547 --> 28:38.243
Our scans of the hull fragment
were inconclusive.

28:38.316 --> 28:40.079
We found
some displaced positrons

28:40.151 --> 28:42.415
that could indicate
a dark- matter impact.

28:42.487 --> 28:44.682
But could've been caused
by something else?

28:44.756 --> 28:45.723
Proof enough.

28:45.790 --> 28:47.223
Not enough for me.

28:47.292 --> 28:50.557
Not enough to jettison
the remaining antimatter.

28:50.628 --> 28:51.890
There's a gas giant

28:51.963 --> 28:54.431
only a few hours
from our current position.

28:54.499 --> 28:57.024
T- class, surrounded
by orbital rings,

28:57.135 --> 28:59.228
including one that's radiogenic.

28:59.337 --> 29:01.202
We could use those particles

29:01.306 --> 29:03.604
to reinitialize
our warp reaction.

29:03.641 --> 29:05.472
With ten percent of
our antimatter left,

29:05.543 --> 29:07.170
we'd only be able
to make warp 2,

29:07.245 --> 29:09.679
but it would be enough to
get us back on the road.

29:09.781 --> 29:11.078
Set a course.

29:16.387 --> 29:18.082
Another spatial fluctuation.

29:18.156 --> 29:19.453
Can you localize it?

29:19.524 --> 29:22.618
lt's somewhere within
the distance

29:22.694 --> 29:24.662
of 10,000 kilometers.

29:24.729 --> 29:27.823
Another one, closer,
about 7,000 kilometers.

29:27.899 --> 29:29.491
lt's being drawn
toward our antimatter.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.659
Eject the core.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.260
Open a channel.
All hailing frequencies.

29:35.006 --> 29:37.975
This is Captain Janeway of the
Federation Vessel Delta Flyer.

29:38.042 --> 29:40.875
We are on a mission
of peaceful exploration.

29:40.979 --> 29:43.743
Please identify yourself.

29:45.683 --> 29:48.083
No response.

29:48.153 --> 29:49.882
Of course not.
lt's a natural phenomenon.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.182
Captain, we only have
a few seconds.

29:51.256 --> 29:54.054
l'm firing a photon torpedo.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.888
There's enough antimatter
in the detonation chamber

29:55.994 --> 29:58.895
to draw that protocomet,
if that's what it is.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.990
The torpedo's away.

30:03.101 --> 30:05.899
Distance: 1,000 kilometers.

30:06.037 --> 30:08.301
1,500.

30:08.373 --> 30:10.170
No spatial disruptions.

30:11.242 --> 30:14.370
Find the source of that sound.

30:26.157 --> 30:27.488
Oh, no.

30:30.428 --> 30:31.861
That's not possible.

30:31.930 --> 30:34.057
Where is he?

30:34.132 --> 30:36.430
l can't locate
his bio- signature.

30:36.534 --> 30:37.831
He's not out there.

30:37.936 --> 30:40.302
He's not in space,
not in subspace.

30:40.371 --> 30:41.702
lt doesn't make sense.

30:49.881 --> 30:53.408
lnside... me...

31:01.960 --> 31:03.052
Activate the transporter.

31:03.127 --> 31:06.290
Try to get a lock
on whatever's inside him.

31:16.341 --> 31:18.468
Tricorder isn't
picking up anything.

31:18.543 --> 31:19.840
But l can feel it.

31:19.911 --> 31:21.276
l- l can't get a lock.

31:21.346 --> 31:23.507
lt's like something's there,
but it's not there.

31:23.581 --> 31:24.980
Oh, it's there.

31:26.818 --> 31:29.184
Unfortunately, l have to agree.

31:29.254 --> 31:32.189
Obviously, whatever hit us
was no protocomet. l was wrong.

31:32.257 --> 31:33.849
Maybe you weren't, not entirely.

31:33.925 --> 31:35.085
Sensors can't scan it;

31:35.159 --> 31:37.423
transporters
can't lock on to it.

31:37.495 --> 31:40.259
Maybe this is some kind
of dark- matter life- form.

31:40.331 --> 31:41.263
That's impossible.

31:41.332 --> 31:42.458
Molecules that complex

31:42.533 --> 31:44.091
would collapse
under their own weight.

31:44.202 --> 31:45.430
They could never support life.

31:45.536 --> 31:47.436
Might be time
to revise your theory.

31:47.505 --> 31:48.529
Where did they take you?

31:48.640 --> 31:51.006
l don't know.

31:51.075 --> 31:52.667
lt was dark.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.803
God, l could feel breathing
all around me.

31:54.879 --> 31:57.006
Did anyone try to communicate
with you?

31:57.081 --> 31:58.241
l couldn't see.

31:58.316 --> 32:01.649
l tried to say something,
but there wasn't enough air.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.345
l tried to move,

32:03.388 --> 32:06.255
but something was pressing
down on me.

32:07.992 --> 32:09.983
The hypospray- - tetrovaline.
lt'll put me out.

32:10.061 --> 32:13.588
lf l sedate you, it could
lower your immune response,

32:13.665 --> 32:15.530
and you need to stay conscious.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.726
Do you understand?

32:18.303 --> 32:20.362
Billy...

32:20.471 --> 32:22.871
if it wanted to kill you,
it would've done it by now.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.909
lt never would've
sent you back here.

32:24.976 --> 32:27.308
Maybe it was trying
to scan you or something.

32:27.378 --> 32:31.439
lf it wanted
to get to know me better...

32:31.516 --> 32:34.212
it should've just asked me out
for a drink.

32:39.123 --> 32:40.590
Celes.

32:49.100 --> 32:50.829
Keep an eye on him.

32:50.935 --> 32:52.197
Harren.

32:58.743 --> 33:00.210
l'm setting a course
for those rings.

33:00.311 --> 33:02.643
Shunt as much power as you can
to the impulse engines.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.204
We never should've
left Voyager.

33:04.282 --> 33:05.374
l've got news for you, crewman.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.384
Voyager isn't exactly
a safe haven.

33:07.452 --> 33:09.044
We've been chased
across the Quadrant

33:09.120 --> 33:11.213
by far worse
than whatever's out there- -

33:11.289 --> 33:15.225
the Vidiians,
Species 8472, the Borg- -

33:15.293 --> 33:18.490
but l guess if somebody's
hiding down on Deck 15,

33:18.563 --> 33:20.428
they may not be aware of it.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.591
l wasn't meant
to be an explorer.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.157
And l wasn't meant
to guide a ship

33:24.235 --> 33:25.395
across an unknown Quadrant.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.937
Then we're both victims
of circumstance.

33:28.072 --> 33:30.040
Oh, l've seen things
l've never imagined,

33:30.141 --> 33:32.769
grown closer to people
than l ever thought possible.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.402
l wouldn't call myself a victim,

33:34.479 --> 33:37.175
and l wouldn't trade
the last six years for anything.

33:37.248 --> 33:38.374
Then you've been deluded

33:38.449 --> 33:40.212
by the inexhaustible
human capacity

33:40.284 --> 33:42.184
to avoid the truth.

33:42.253 --> 33:44.483
You're the one hiding, not me.

33:44.555 --> 33:48.218
l've got you three more
percentage points of impulse.

33:48.292 --> 33:49.281
l'll take it.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.987
Setting a course.

33:56.567 --> 33:59.195
lsn't there any part of you
that feels a bond

33:59.303 --> 34:00.702
with the rest of us?

34:00.805 --> 34:02.796
When we escape
from the Borg or discover

34:02.874 --> 34:03.841
a new type of star,

34:03.941 --> 34:06.307
don't you feel
some pride of accomplishment?

34:06.377 --> 34:08.436
When you're in the Mess Hall,

34:08.513 --> 34:10.981
alone at your table
in the corner,

34:11.049 --> 34:14.780
don't you see
the friendships around you

34:14.851 --> 34:18.219
and wish even for a microsecond
you were part of them?

34:22.293 --> 34:25.023
You don't know me at all.

34:25.096 --> 34:26.688
No, but l'd like to.

34:26.764 --> 34:30.063
That was the whole point
of this mission.

34:31.936 --> 34:37.067
But l guess it hasn't
worked out like l planned.

34:37.141 --> 34:39.268
lncoming transmission.

34:39.342 --> 34:40.310
Source?

34:40.411 --> 34:41.935
lt's a Starfleet frequency.

34:42.013 --> 34:43.639
Must be Voyager.

34:44.715 --> 34:46.909
...the Delta Flyer.
...phenomenon...

34:46.984 --> 34:49.179
...hit by an...
...heavy damage.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.915
Repeat: require,
require immediate...

34:51.989 --> 34:54.786
immediate, immediate...
Flyer, Flyer, Flyer, Flyer...

34:54.859 --> 34:56.724
Subspace echo.

34:56.793 --> 35:00.696
Maybe not. There's a .005
deviation in the carrier wave.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.323
That's the same degree
of spatial fluctuation

35:02.400 --> 35:04.561
left by our pursuers.

35:04.669 --> 35:08.105
They're sending
our distress signal back to us.

35:08.172 --> 35:11.039
Modified. They might
be trying to communicate.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.474
...Delta Flyer, Flyer, Flyer.

35:12.543 --> 35:14.602
...hit by an unknown
phenomenon, unknown.

35:14.679 --> 35:15.873
They're taunting us.

35:16.013 --> 35:17.776
Not necessarily.

35:17.849 --> 35:19.510
Try to adjust the universal
translator for...

35:19.584 --> 35:20.551
Captain!

35:22.520 --> 35:24.886
He went right through
the force field.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.890
Billy, what are you doing?

35:26.991 --> 35:29.516
lt's activating
my motor neurons.

35:29.594 --> 35:31.152
l can't make it stop.

35:31.229 --> 35:32.719
l'm sorry, Captain.

35:32.797 --> 35:36.255
You've got to stop it.

35:38.202 --> 35:39.226
No.

35:39.337 --> 35:41.771
lt's okay, Billy, it's okay.

35:41.839 --> 35:43.568
lt's okay.

35:45.376 --> 35:47.936
lt's in here.

35:53.584 --> 35:55.074
lt's tapping into our systems.

35:55.153 --> 35:58.145
Wait. lt may be
trying to communicate.

36:05.930 --> 36:07.261
lt's into our
environmental controls.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.298
We've got to stop it.

36:09.233 --> 36:09.892
Hold your fire!

36:12.870 --> 36:13.962
What the hell is wrong with you?

36:14.071 --> 36:15.766
lt was trying to kill us.

36:15.873 --> 36:17.135
- You don't know that.
- We were at risk.

36:17.208 --> 36:18.300
l gave you a direct order.

36:18.409 --> 36:19.706
What if you were wrong?

36:19.777 --> 36:22.974
l could hear
its thoughts.

36:23.047 --> 36:25.038
Explain.

36:25.116 --> 36:26.674
When it left me...

36:26.751 --> 36:29.584
l could hear
what it was thinking.

36:29.654 --> 36:32.316
''Do not belong.''

36:32.390 --> 36:34.881
That's what it said:
''Do not belong.''

36:35.026 --> 36:36.857
We don't belong here.

36:36.928 --> 36:39.294
Or it didn't belong
in the Delta Flyer.

36:39.363 --> 36:42.730
Maybe that's why it was tapping
into the environmental controls.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.597
lt was trying to survive
in a place

36:44.702 --> 36:46.135
it didn't belong.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.034
That's speculation.

36:47.104 --> 36:49.436
Based on direct observation.

36:49.507 --> 36:51.270
You murdered an alien being
and destroyed

36:51.342 --> 36:54.800
any chance we had
to make first contact.

36:58.015 --> 37:00.074
We just lost
another section of hull.

37:00.184 --> 37:01.981
How far are we
from the gas giant?

37:02.019 --> 37:03.953
200,000 kilometers.

37:04.021 --> 37:06.080
l'm taking the Flyer
into the radiogenic ring.

37:06.157 --> 37:08.751
With any luck,
they won't follow.

37:08.826 --> 37:10.418
We can't survive in there
for more than a few minutes.

37:10.494 --> 37:13.327
That should be enough
to reinitialize the warp core.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.482
Start continuous transport
of radiogenic particles

37:33.551 --> 37:35.246
directly into
the reaction chamber.

37:35.319 --> 37:38.049
When it's approaching
critical mass, let me know.

37:38.122 --> 37:40.989
Watch for any sign of pursuit.

37:41.058 --> 37:43.049
How are you doing?

37:43.127 --> 37:46.563
l always had this alarm
in my head,

37:46.631 --> 37:50.897
sort of an internal Red Alert.

37:51.035 --> 37:53.128
lt was like a warning system

37:53.237 --> 37:57.196
that would tell me
l was sick or dying...

37:57.308 --> 37:58.673
of something.

37:58.743 --> 38:04.739
Mitochondrial prions,
food poisoning, a head cold.

38:04.849 --> 38:07.283
lt was always there.

38:07.318 --> 38:09.149
And now it's not?

38:11.222 --> 38:14.157
lt's gone.

38:14.225 --> 38:16.386
l don't understand.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.826
Maybe l do.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.989
When l was a girl,
l was afraid of the ocean.

38:22.066 --> 38:25.331
l liked to swim, but,
uh, in a pool or a pond,

38:25.436 --> 38:27.370
where l knew exactly
what was beneath me.

38:27.438 --> 38:28.666
But in the open water,

38:28.773 --> 38:31.264
with no way to know
what was down there...

38:31.375 --> 38:32.842
it scared me to death.

38:32.910 --> 38:35.845
lt wasn't until my first
year at the Academy,

38:35.913 --> 38:42.375
after l went through zero- G
training in the Coral Sea...

38:42.453 --> 38:44.921
that l finally got over it.

38:47.058 --> 38:50.550
l think you just came up
from your first deep dive.

38:50.761 --> 38:52.922
They're in pursuit.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.562
Three minutes,
20 seconds to intercept.

39:01.639 --> 39:04.369
We'll need twice that
to reinitialize warp reaction.

39:04.442 --> 39:06.410
Get into the escape pods.

39:06.477 --> 39:08.069
Captain.

39:08.145 --> 39:09.908
Plot a course
away from the planet.

39:09.980 --> 39:11.641
l'm going to fire
a phaser volley

39:11.716 --> 39:13.650
and hopefully set off
a chain reaction

39:13.718 --> 39:15.185
of the radiogenic particles.

39:15.252 --> 39:17.413
lt might be enough
to disable our friends.

39:17.488 --> 39:18.512
You'll be disabled, too.

39:18.589 --> 39:19.647
Not if l go to full thrusters

39:19.724 --> 39:21.214
and keep in front
of the shock wave.

39:22.793 --> 39:24.260
lf l don't make it,

39:24.328 --> 39:25.818
head for the L- Class moon
in the next system.

39:25.896 --> 39:27.830
You could survive there
for weeks if you have to- -

39:27.898 --> 39:30.833
enough time for Voyager
to pick up your distress signal.

39:30.935 --> 39:32.095
Now get moving.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.500
No.

39:33.604 --> 39:35.663
You'll have a better chance
if we're with you.

39:35.773 --> 39:36.797
Go.

39:36.907 --> 39:38.636
We might not have
contributed much

39:38.709 --> 39:40.870
on Voyager, but what
we do here matters.

39:40.945 --> 39:41.877
We're the crew here,

39:41.946 --> 39:45.040
and the crew does not abandon
its captain.

39:55.426 --> 39:57.394
All right, it's your choice.

39:57.461 --> 40:00.521
Then l'll be going alone.

40:00.598 --> 40:03.192
Good luck.

40:05.770 --> 40:07.465
Charge phaser banks.

40:07.571 --> 40:11.166
Stand by to divert
all power to thrusters.

40:11.275 --> 40:14.073
Escape Pod 1 is occupied
and ready, Captain.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.613
Launch Pod 1.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.272
Escape pod away.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.544
How close are our pursuers?

40:20.618 --> 40:21.744
65 seconds to intercept.

40:21.819 --> 40:23.047
Stand by to fire.

40:24.321 --> 40:26.619
Captain, the escape pod
is altering course.

40:26.690 --> 40:28.214
lt's heading for the aliens.

40:28.292 --> 40:29.919
Janeway to Harren.

40:29.994 --> 40:30.961
What are you doing?

40:31.061 --> 40:32.619
lf they have to deal with me,

40:32.696 --> 40:35.426
it should give you
a few more seconds to get away.

40:35.499 --> 40:36.796
That's my theory, anyway.

40:36.867 --> 40:39.062
Resume your escape course now.

40:39.170 --> 40:40.398
lt's too late for that.

40:40.504 --> 40:41.436
You made a mistake,

40:41.505 --> 40:43.336
Harren. Don't make another one.

40:43.407 --> 40:44.931
l'm done hiding, Captain.

40:45.042 --> 40:47.010
A few seconds of exposure
to real life...

40:47.144 --> 40:51.342
maybe l'll understand
what l've been missing.

40:52.416 --> 40:53.747
He closed the channel.

40:53.818 --> 40:55.012
Get a transporter
lock on that pod.

40:55.152 --> 40:58.417
l- l can't. We're out of range.

40:58.489 --> 41:00.320
More power to the thrusters.

41:06.430 --> 41:08.227
Celes.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.857
We're still not close enough.

41:09.934 --> 41:11.231
Thrusters at maximum.

41:17.308 --> 41:17.899
Got him.

41:18.075 --> 41:19.940
Fire.

41:27.518 --> 41:28.951
Shock wave approaching.

41:29.019 --> 41:31.510
Contact in four... three...

41:31.589 --> 41:34.524
two... one.

41:36.427 --> 41:38.019
More or less.

41:57.448 --> 41:58.380
My crew...

41:58.449 --> 42:00.246
Easy.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.682
They're sleeping.

42:05.756 --> 42:07.451
No serious injuries.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.686
Everyone's all right...

42:09.760 --> 42:11.421
though you gave us
a good scare for a while.

42:12.496 --> 42:14.464
We received your distress call.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.228
We found the Flyer
drifting above a gas giant.

42:17.334 --> 42:19.461
You were all unconscious.

42:19.570 --> 42:22.471
Any sign of...

42:22.540 --> 42:25.407
another vessel or
some kind of entity?

42:25.476 --> 42:27.273
No.

42:30.915 --> 42:33.008
What happened?

42:34.985 --> 42:39.854
The Good Shepherd went
after some lost sheep

42:39.924 --> 42:44.258
and ran into a wolf.

42:44.328 --> 42:46.387
Did she find them?

42:57.074 --> 43:00.339
l think she did.
