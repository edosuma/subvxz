00:27.778 --> 00:29.904
Hi. It's me.
Um...

00:29.988 --> 00:33.658
I know you're in Arizona for
the wedding, but I really need...

00:35.494 --> 00:37.412
I just wanna talk to you.

00:37.496 --> 00:40.081
Okay? So can you please
call me back?

00:59.893 --> 01:01.269
Okay, everybody.

01:01.353 --> 01:04.980
Let's get on the dance floor
for the Minnesota bride and groom,

01:05.065 --> 01:07.817
Mr. and Mrs. Scott Thomas.

01:10.487 --> 01:13.990
What do you think?

01:14.074 --> 01:16.993
- This is my best day ever.
- No. Best day?

01:17.077 --> 01:18.995
- Mm-hmm.
- It's pretty good.

01:19.079 --> 01:22.123
Yeah. How about you?

01:22.207 --> 01:25.209
- Is it my best day ever?
- Yeah.

01:25.294 --> 01:27.837
Excluding the bachelor party, right?

01:27.921 --> 01:30.256
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.966
Of course it was.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.011
I gotta be honest though.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.765
I'm pretty open-minded about
talking about the honeymoon.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.601
- Really?
- Yeah, I am.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.020
You and me and a bottle of red.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.939
Deserted beach in Cabo.

01:47.024 --> 01:50.026
- I like the sound of that.
- Me too.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.654
Let's say good-bye to our closest
75 friends and family.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.948
Who wants a shot, baby?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.451
Come on. Little tequila
for the bride and groom?

01:58.535 --> 02:00.620
I'm still good
with champagne, Lumpy.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.413
Yeah, maybe when this dance
is over. Okay?

02:04.208 --> 02:05.625
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.585
- It's over.
- It sure is.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.630
Come on. Come on.
You gotta celebrate, right?

02:10.714 --> 02:12.423
Come on.
You only get married once.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.217
You know, until you turn 40
and you trade in

02:14.301 --> 02:17.136
for the newer, sleeker,
better-looking models.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.387
- I'm kidding.
- He's kidding.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.807
- Okay, one time.
- All right!

02:20.891 --> 02:23.100
Oh, shit.
I thought you had...

02:23.185 --> 02:26.020
- My dress.
- I'm so sorry.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.563
It's okay. It's okay.
It's not a big deal.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.358
Kristin, I'm really sorry.
I didn't...

02:30.442 --> 02:34.028
I thought she was...

02:34.154 --> 02:37.198
Kristin insisted on
this destination wedding.

02:37.282 --> 02:41.244
I would have loved
a Christmas wedding in Minneapolis.

02:41.328 --> 02:44.038
That would have been lovely, too.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.040
But, you know, I told her

02:46.124 --> 02:48.084
that it was gonna cost
everybody a fortune

02:48.168 --> 02:50.127
to fly down to Phoenix.

02:50.212 --> 02:53.422
Honestly, you can't even tell.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.800
Will you button
the little buttons on the back?

02:55.884 --> 02:57.134
Be careful.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.971
You don't wanna rip
a $2,000 dress.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.431
It was 3,000.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.142
- Does Scott know that?
- Mm-mmm.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.562
Man, I really, really hope
I didn't ruin her dress.

03:07.646 --> 03:10.106
Oh, my God.
Would you stop it?

03:10.190 --> 03:12.859
And even if you did, when is she
gonna wear the thing again?

03:12.943 --> 03:16.112
- I like the way you think.
- That is good.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.905
- Oh.
- Hey, man.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.448
Thanks again for that loan.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.784
- Yeah. Sure, sure.
- No, I... I mean it.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.327
That was too much.

03:23.412 --> 03:26.122
Well, consider it
a wedding gift, okay?

03:26.206 --> 03:27.623
Oh, what are you talking about?

03:27.708 --> 03:30.459
No. I'm paying you back for that.
It was way too much.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.461
No, I'm serious.
I didn't get you a wedding gift.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.130
- Take the cash.
- I can't.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.965
- Take it.
- Well...

03:36.049 --> 03:38.134
- Did you just kiss your tie?
- No, I'm...

03:38.218 --> 03:39.677
I've got drool.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.345
- Oh, that's charming.
- Thank you.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.139
You know the thing is...

03:43.223 --> 03:45.182
I need it.
I'll be honest with you.

03:45.267 --> 03:47.143
It's embarrassing,
but I had no idea

03:47.227 --> 03:48.978
the honeymoon
was gonna cost so much

03:49.062 --> 03:51.522
and Rick screwed me so hard
on that commission.

03:51.607 --> 03:54.191
Scotty, Scotty, Scotty.
Just stop.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.152
- I love you, man.
- Oh, boy.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.486
- I do.
- Okay.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.113
Yeah, I do.
I wanna touch you.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.032
- Oh, come on.
- I wanna get my hands on you.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.159
- Okay.
- Okay. Is it too much?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.161
- That is too much.
- All right. I got carried away.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.121
Just man up and drink,
would you?

04:07.205 --> 04:09.749
What is this?

04:09.833 --> 04:13.044
- I'm not even sure what it is.
- Oh, my God.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.171
You know, I didn't say anything

04:15.255 --> 04:17.173
when Lumpy gargled champagne
during his toast,

04:17.257 --> 04:19.675
or he decided to helicopter
a six-month-old

04:19.760 --> 04:20.885
during the groom's dinner.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.888
He kept referring to himself
as "The Baby Whisperer."

04:23.972 --> 04:25.598
No. It's not funny.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.142
The kid vomited mashed peas
all over the lobby.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.810
We have to pay for that.

04:29.895 --> 04:32.021
Barkeep, another one.

04:54.670 --> 04:57.254
How about a kiss? Come on.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.332
All right, I'm up.
All right. All right.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.959
Yeah. Yeah.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.469
I... I'm all right.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.267
Set 'em up!
Let's go.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.355
- Lumpy, man.
- Hey.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.691
- All right. All right.
- Yeah.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.277
Hey, buddy, I...
Why don't you call it a night, man?

06:01.361 --> 06:03.738
- Hmm. What? What?
- Time to pack it in.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.364
- What?
- Yeah.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.074
- You're cutting off...
- Dude.

06:07.159 --> 06:08.701
You're cutting off
the best man?

06:08.785 --> 06:11.245
Dude, come on.
You threw up in the women's bathroom.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.747
- No, I didn't. Did I?
- You did.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.332
- One more drink.
- No, no, no. Please. Come on.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.251
Aw! You're so lame.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.295
You're just...
You're just lame.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.256
No, all right.
Y-Y-You're lame. You're lame-o.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.467
- All right. I know.
- You're the lamest...

06:24.551 --> 06:26.010
Ooh. Oh!

06:26.094 --> 06:27.094
You okay?

06:27.179 --> 06:28.763
Yes! Yeah!
I'm good. Yep.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.306
Okay.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.894
Thanks a lot,
Captain Lame. Captain Lame-o.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.354
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's great now.

06:37.439 --> 06:40.316
Tomorrow morning
it's gonna be another story.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.320
Livin' in a lamish community,
churnin' up that lame butter.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.322
Sorry.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.032
Look out, everybody!

06:59.127 --> 07:01.587
- Shut up in there!
- You shut up!

07:51.513 --> 07:53.514
Hmm.

09:20.310 --> 09:24.355
Come on. Get up.

09:24.439 --> 09:27.483
Ramsey, I'm not kidding.
You can't be late again.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.242
Get up.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.701
I'm up.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.208
What is your problem?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.211
Give me one second.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.964
And don't hassle your mother.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.674
What's going on?

09:53.593 --> 09:55.010
Nothing.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.055
I'm going to bed.

10:01.059 --> 10:04.478
I don't know a Dave.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.522
David? No.

10:06.606 --> 10:10.567
Danny?
My boss's name is Danny.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.196
He might be a Gemini.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.532
What kind of danger?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.868
Hey, um, you're gonna have to
try harder with Winston.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.872
- Where is he?
- He went back to bed.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.874
Oh.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.669
I should go too.

10:30.672 --> 10:33.299
Okay.
I'll call you tomorrow.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.011
Bye.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.181
Ms. Shirley?

10:42.642 --> 10:45.352
She says that Dan's in danger.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.605
You know, Dan from work.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.817
I'm gonna tell him.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.447
You should call her sometime.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.784
By the way,

11:00.869 --> 11:03.746
you never told me where you slept
the other night.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.291
Why don't you ask Ms. Shirley?

11:07.375 --> 11:09.335
God, if you were
with some guy...

11:09.419 --> 11:12.087
I was at a friend's house.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.672
What friend?

11:15.467 --> 11:18.802
Hey! Aren't you gonna
eat something?

11:18.887 --> 11:20.512
I'm not hungry.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.615
That's it?

11:39.699 --> 11:41.909
Sorry. I have to
get my day started.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.915
Yeah, me too.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.544
What?

11:52.629 --> 11:55.214
I drove all the way up here
to see you.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.842
Couldn't we at least
have breakfast?

11:58.927 --> 12:00.427
Hang out a little?

12:00.512 --> 12:02.679
It's a small town.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.481
Hey.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.859
Maybe I can arrange
a day off next week.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.986
You know what?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.530
Forget it.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.834
Jesus!

12:33.378 --> 12:34.920
Hot date?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.591
What are you doing here?

12:40.593 --> 12:41.969
You know I like to watch.

12:42.053 --> 12:43.720
I hate it when
you pull the blinds, Dad.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.931
I'm not your dad.

12:47.058 --> 12:50.144
Dad, father, father, dad...
Whatever.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.895
I need 50 bucks.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.981
I don't have 50 bucks.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.733
This is really your best option?
Blackmailing a priest?

12:58.069 --> 12:59.736
Think of it
as community welfare.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.738
Isn't there a doctor or a lawyer
you can hustle?

13:01.823 --> 13:04.658
If you want me to go back to
taking it out of the offering tray,

13:04.742 --> 13:06.994
I will.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.382
They just found him
lying there?

13:20.467 --> 13:22.759
Yeah. I don't know
what he was doing.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.723
- How...
- I don't know.

13:27.807 --> 13:32.352
A security camera caught him going
out the back door at, like, 1:30.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.229
There's blood
all over his room.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.731
I... I don't know.

13:37.775 --> 13:38.942
Hi, honey.

13:40.111 --> 13:42.863
Everyone is just devastated.

13:42.947 --> 13:46.742
Is there anything that Roger and I
could do for you?

13:46.826 --> 13:49.161
No, I don't think so, Gail.
Thanks though.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.998
Well, I don't mean
to upset you,

13:53.082 --> 13:58.879
but this might be
a liability here.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.757
Mom, I don't think
that this is a good time.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.010
You know, sweetheart,
you cannot be too careful.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.555
The hotel should
take responsibility.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.265
We could blame the bartenders.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.100
Have you two eaten anything yet?

14:12.185 --> 14:14.353
Uh, thank you, Dad.
We're not hungry.

14:14.437 --> 14:17.397
The resort has a complimentary
continental breakfast.

14:19.526 --> 14:23.737
Could you guys go say good-bye
to some of the guests?

14:23.821 --> 14:25.989
- Yes, we could, honey.
- That would be really helpful.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.075
All right. Yeah.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.958
- I'm sorry.
- Wow.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.210
I'm sorry.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.797
I'm sorry I don't have a referral
to another provider.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.675
So there's only one company
that can ship a body?

14:44.759 --> 14:48.428
You could keep the deceased
in Arizona, have the services here.

14:48.513 --> 14:51.431
No, no, no. The funeral and
the burial have to be in Minnesota.

14:51.516 --> 14:52.516
Um...

14:52.600 --> 14:56.061
Then I guess you're
out of options.

14:57.188 --> 14:58.814
Really, Mr. Huxley?
There's nothing else?

14:58.898 --> 15:01.149
'Cause I'm in
a tight spot here.

16:08.259 --> 16:09.509
- Oh!
- Oh!

16:09.594 --> 16:12.179
Oh, God! What the hell
are you doing?

16:12.263 --> 16:15.682
Oh. Oh, uh... He, um...

16:15.767 --> 16:18.268
Jesus Christ.
Can we go, please?

16:19.187 --> 16:20.896
Oh, my God.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.324
There are so many questions
I have for you.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.576
There are so many things I'm
curious about, but you know what?

16:34.661 --> 16:38.914
I think it would be best if we just
never talked about that again.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.791
- Okay? Ever.
- I think that's fine.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.542
- Great.
- Great.

16:42.627 --> 16:45.087
Let's go back to the hotel, we'll
pack our stuff and call the airline.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.923
See if they can get us on a redeye
back to Minneapolis.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.509
What...
Minneapolis? No.

16:50.593 --> 16:53.345
- Uh, we're going home now?
- Yeah.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.930
Why?

16:55.014 --> 16:58.308
I assumed that the funeral
would be after the honeymoon.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.937
You... You wanna
postpone the funeral?

17:02.021 --> 17:03.438
Who postpones a funeral?

17:05.023 --> 17:08.026
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
I mean, our honeymoon...

17:08.111 --> 17:10.444
I've been dreaming about it
since I was a little girl.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.615
I'm supposed to be
in a caftan under a palm tree.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.032
What's a caftan?

17:15.117 --> 17:17.160
You don't know
what a caftan is?

17:17.244 --> 17:19.871
I know you never got Lumpy.
Okay? Let's just be honest.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.540
You didn't want him
to be my best man.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.040
I didn't say that.
What I said was,

17:23.126 --> 17:24.960
you two didn't spend
much time together anymore.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.545
What does that mean?
We're men.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.840
Men don't spend
a lot of time together.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.675
We have to go home
because I have to take care

17:31.759 --> 17:34.511
of my friend's
funeral arrangement, okay?

17:37.265 --> 17:40.767
I can't believe this happened
on our wedding night.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.565
Hey, will you hold this?
It's Lumpy's.

17:46.649 --> 17:49.317
Then we can make some calls,
just let people know what happened.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.904
There are only six numbers stored.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.948
Two of them
are for pizza delivery.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.703
It's not a joke.
It's true.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.038
- Who's Ramsey Anderson?
- No idea.

18:02.123 --> 18:06.042
Probably a friend from law school
or the restaurant maybe.

18:11.174 --> 18:15.051
So, after the autopsy they're gonna
ship the body back to Minnesota

18:15.136 --> 18:17.387
- by budget courier.
- Budget courier?

18:17.472 --> 18:19.097
- Is that a normal thing?
- I don't know.

18:19.182 --> 18:23.310
I've, weirdly, never had to ship
a friend's body anywhere before.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.687
It's still gonna be $2,000.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.105
We don't have it.

18:27.190 --> 18:31.693
Not after the open bar and
the welcome baskets for the guests.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.029
And a $2,000 dress.

18:34.113 --> 18:38.617
- So, it wasn't worth it?
- Come on, I didn't say that.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.578
We're gonna have to use the honeymoon
money for the funeral though.

18:41.662 --> 18:45.582
What choice do I have, Kristin?
He was my best man.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.691
Hi.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.237
Aren't you supposed
to be in school?

19:15.321 --> 19:17.656
Someone's gotta shop for food.

19:18.699 --> 19:22.077
Yeah. Well, you don't have a job.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.620
Neither do you.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.164
Why you gotta be like that?

19:26.249 --> 19:28.333
I'm trying to make things work,
you know?

19:28.417 --> 19:30.335
I thought we had a deal here.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.254
I don't like that deal.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.297
I didn't ask if you liked it.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.675
Hey. I'm not finished.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.763
I'm not finished.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.477
This is your family, Ramsey.

19:47.562 --> 19:50.647
Whether you like it or not,
we're family.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.663
You're welcome?

21:31.832 --> 21:33.208
Can we just go?

21:33.292 --> 21:37.087
- I have to tell your mother.
- No!

21:37.171 --> 21:39.756
I know what I promised, but I
could get in serious trouble here.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.842
It was just cold medicine.

21:43.928 --> 21:46.638
You don't look
like you have a cold.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.767
You're lucky I was able
to talk the sheriff

21:50.851 --> 21:53.186
into releasing you into my custody.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.230
Yeah, really lucky.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.898
Ramsey.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.692
Ramsey, wait.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.404
Ramsey.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.200
Look, it's seriously decent of you
to spring me from my incarceration.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.576
But I'm fine, okay?

22:08.661 --> 22:13.373
I know why people buy cold medicine.
It's to make crystal meth.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.583
Why'd you steal it anyway?
I just gave you money.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.461
- I spent it.
- On drugs?

22:18.546 --> 22:20.338
Don't you have candles to light,

22:20.423 --> 22:23.883
or, like, wine and crackers
to hand out?

22:23.968 --> 22:25.427
That's what you think I do?

22:25.511 --> 22:27.637
Mood lighting and catering?

22:28.556 --> 22:30.306
I don't do drugs, okay?

22:30.391 --> 22:33.393
You only have
a couple of more months of this.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.478
Don't blow it!

22:39.817 --> 22:42.277
Welcome aboard
Valdez flight 896,

22:42.361 --> 22:44.279
redeye to Minneapolis, Minnesota.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.531
It's gonna be a full flight tonight,
folks, so we ask you

22:46.615 --> 22:48.783
to find your seat and stow
your luggage as quickly as possible

22:48.868 --> 22:51.161
for an on-time departure.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.420
- Oh, my God.
- What? What's wrong?

23:00.504 --> 23:03.923
I think I packed the Ambien
in my suitcase.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.301
- Okay, are...
- I can't believe this.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.386
- Are you sure?
- Oh, my God.

23:08.471 --> 23:10.555
Well, look...
Look in that guy.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.307
Jesus.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.100
Kris, it's only
a four-hour flight.

23:14.185 --> 23:16.352
But I need to sleep.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.939
I need a Xanax.

23:20.858 --> 23:23.651
Jesus. How many pills
are you taking?

23:23.736 --> 23:26.196
My God.
You're like a pharmacy in there.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.781
These ones are the white ones,
not the orange ones.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.282
They're like half as strong.

23:29.366 --> 23:32.077
And the blue ones, those are the ones
that are for crazies.

23:32.161 --> 23:36.206
Okay, Elvis, when did chronic
anxiety take over your life?

23:36.290 --> 23:37.832
Am I missing something?

23:37.917 --> 23:40.835
Why are... You're like announcing this
to the entire plane.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.671
Oh, relax. He's the one guy
that's eavesdropping.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.091
We don't even know him.
Who cares?

23:46.175 --> 23:48.218
Hi.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.180
I'm Neil.
Your mom's cousin's son?

23:52.264 --> 23:53.848
We met at the reception.

23:54.725 --> 23:57.352
- Right.
- Hi, Neil.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.813
- I'm really sorry about your friend.
- Thank you, Neil.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.359
I don't have anxiety issues.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.736
- Oh, I wasn't even paying attention.
- He wasn't listening.

24:06.821 --> 24:08.404
I have a slight fear of flying.

24:08.489 --> 24:11.116
Xanax helps take the edge off
during takeoff.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.326
- Okay.
- But don't need 'em.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.829
Not like I'm addicted.

24:15.913 --> 24:18.123
Kris, he doesn't care.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.458
How are you at flying?
Do you want one?

24:20.543 --> 24:22.752
They're the white ones.
They're not the orange ones.

24:22.837 --> 24:26.881
No. Thank you though.
I appreciate that.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.634
Um, gosh, you know,

24:29.718 --> 24:33.805
that is a "D" on my ticket,

24:33.889 --> 24:37.016
which means I have the wrong seat.

24:37.101 --> 24:40.353
So I'm gonna scooch on over.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.592
Rick going to be
at the funeral?

25:10.676 --> 25:12.802
Oh, well, yeah, probably.

25:12.887 --> 25:16.055
We've both known Lumpy
since junior high, so guessing.

25:17.391 --> 25:19.350
Such a real estate crook.

25:19.435 --> 25:24.522
Yeah, and his dad's my boss,
so please remember that, Kris.

25:24.607 --> 25:26.441
I thought you didn't have to
pay a referral fee

25:26.525 --> 25:28.109
if it was within the office.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.987
You do sometimes.
It depends.

25:31.614 --> 25:32.655
He fails.

25:32.740 --> 25:36.993
Ethan risks everything to be with
the woman that he loves,

25:37.077 --> 25:40.330
but he fails.
Why?

25:40.414 --> 25:44.500
Why would Wharton
have Ethan and Mattie fail?

25:45.544 --> 25:47.545
Anna? What do you think?

25:47.630 --> 25:49.756
I didn't read it.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.216
Did anybody read it?

25:53.135 --> 25:56.471
No. See, that's the thing
about literature...

25:56.555 --> 25:58.306
You have to read it.

25:59.475 --> 26:02.310
Okay. For tomorrow...

26:02.394 --> 26:05.188
I want everyone
to finish Ethan Frome.

26:06.649 --> 26:08.858
- Lunch?
- Sure.

26:10.569 --> 26:11.986
I was talking to her.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.711
All I'm saying is
that I can't think of a time

26:28.796 --> 26:31.839
when Lumpy wasn't either drunk
or naked or both.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.008
Yeah, everyone lets loose
on vacation.

26:34.093 --> 26:37.220
Clearly you've forgotten the hairy
bead rack incident on Bourbon St.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.514
Oh, yeah.

26:39.598 --> 26:43.184
I mean, New Orleans was struggling
through a post-Katrina holocaust,

26:43.269 --> 26:44.811
and Lumpy thinks he can
brighten everyone's day

26:44.895 --> 26:47.981
by hanging beads from...
What did he call it?

26:48.065 --> 26:49.148
His hairy button.

26:49.233 --> 26:50.984
- Hairy button.
- That was hilarious.

26:51.068 --> 26:52.610
- Oh, Scott.
- Okay, listen. You know what?

26:52.695 --> 26:56.322
I agree, in the last year the
drinking got a little out of control.

26:56.407 --> 26:58.616
But I don't know
what you want me to say, Kris.

26:58.701 --> 27:02.036
I mean, he was my best friend.

27:02.121 --> 27:06.874
But he wasn't your best friend.
He was your oldest friend.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.876
There's a difference.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.878
I don't care what you call him.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.047
I knew Lumpy
better than anyone.

27:15.426 --> 27:17.385
I'm very sorry for your loss,

27:17.469 --> 27:20.596
but Lawrence is no longer
a law student here.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.892
What? N... No.
That must be a mistake.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.687
Well, he hasn't been enrolled
for almost a year.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.564
A year?

27:29.648 --> 27:31.316
Did he transfer
to another school?

27:31.400 --> 27:35.445
I don't have any record
of a transcript request.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.071
He flunked out of law school?

27:37.156 --> 27:38.573
Actually, his grades
were quite strong.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.951
- He left for personal reasons.
- What does that mean?

27:42.036 --> 27:44.871
I... I'm sorry. I don't have
any further information.

27:44.955 --> 27:49.584
But I'd be happy to put his funeral
announcement on our website.

27:49.668 --> 27:53.254
Uh, thank you... Actually, could you
search for one more student for us?

27:53.339 --> 27:55.298
It's a friend of Lumpy's.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.675
- Lumpy?
- Lawrence. Sorry.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.385
Of course.

27:59.470 --> 28:01.554
Uh, what's the name?

28:01.638 --> 28:03.556
- Uh, Ra...
- Ramsey Anderson.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.266
I'll check.

28:08.395 --> 28:12.648
Sorry. Lots of Andersons.
No Ramsey.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.031
Yeah. This is it.

28:26.580 --> 28:27.914
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:27.998 --> 28:30.166
- Two?
- No, we're actually not here to eat.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.960
Um, we're friends of Lumpy's.

28:34.421 --> 28:37.298
Last time I saw Lumps
we were totally wasted,

28:37.383 --> 28:40.134
and we ended up...

28:40.219 --> 28:41.719
N-Never mind.

28:41.804 --> 28:43.429
How old are you?

28:43.514 --> 28:45.807
I'm afraid we have
some really bad news.

28:45.891 --> 28:49.143
Uh, L-Lumpy passed away

28:49.228 --> 28:51.145
- over the weekend.
- What?

28:51.230 --> 28:54.440
It was an accident. It was
a very unfortunate accident.

28:54.525 --> 28:56.484
We just wanted
to tell his manager

28:56.568 --> 28:57.985
and let everyone know
about the funeral.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.654
Oh, my God. He O.D.'d.

28:59.738 --> 29:03.199
No. No, no, no.
Why would you think he O.D.'d?

29:03.283 --> 29:04.700
He died on a cactus.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.328
Can you tell your manager

29:07.413 --> 29:09.539
that we're here
to talk to him or her?

29:09.623 --> 29:12.875
Uh, sure. Lumpy hasn't worked here
in a couple of months though.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.293
He hasn't?

29:14.378 --> 29:16.170
No, he was...
he was fired.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.005
What?

29:18.090 --> 29:20.466
How could he fire Lumpy?
Lumpy loved this job.

29:20.551 --> 29:21.968
- Is he in there?
- You can't go in there!

29:22.052 --> 29:23.469
Scott, don't do that.
I swear to God.

29:23.554 --> 29:24.971
Bruce doesn't like
to be interrupted.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.348
Oh, eureka.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.892
- What?
- Oh. God, sorry.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.687
- Um...
- You can't just barge in here.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.231
I just wanted to talk to you,
but I-I'll wait outside.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.653
I think he needs a minute.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.119
He was stealing?

29:48.203 --> 29:49.912
Uh, we caught him on camera.

29:49.997 --> 29:52.707
No. There's no way.
Not Lumpy.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.710
Look, bartending
is a cash business.

29:55.794 --> 29:59.130
It happens, you know.
Sooner or later, temptation wins out.

29:59.214 --> 30:02.675
Did you call the police? Is there
a report that was filed or something?

30:02.759 --> 30:05.595
The owners wanted to,
but I never did.

30:05.679 --> 30:08.723
- Why?
- I think he was in a bad place.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.933
What do you mean?

30:11.018 --> 30:14.687
There was a lot of booze
and, uh,

30:14.771 --> 30:17.106
some girl up north
in, uh, Lutsen.

30:17.191 --> 30:19.859
Do you remember her name,
by any chance?

30:19.943 --> 30:21.944
Oh, man. Uh...

30:22.029 --> 30:24.238
Was it Ramsey?

30:24.323 --> 30:26.032
It... Maybe. Yeah.
That sounds right.

30:26.116 --> 30:29.035
Okay. Thank you for your time.

30:29.119 --> 30:30.745
And sorry about barging in again.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.830
I'm real sorry
about your friend.

30:32.915 --> 30:34.749
- Everyone liked Lumpy.
- Yeah.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.834
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

30:36.919 --> 30:39.170
Don't touch it!

30:39.254 --> 30:41.297
Thank you.

30:49.598 --> 30:52.808
Hey.

30:54.311 --> 30:56.312
Aren't you going to work?

30:56.396 --> 30:59.482
I called Dan.
I told him I wasn't feeling well.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.778
- Is he okay?
- Hmm?

31:03.862 --> 31:05.488
Wasn't he in danger?

31:06.865 --> 31:09.450
You don't believe
in Ms. Shirley, do you?

31:09.535 --> 31:11.202
She's from
Thief River Falls, Mom.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.830
It is a gift.
She has a real gift.

31:14.915 --> 31:17.667
Yeah.
For taking your money.

31:17.751 --> 31:21.003
The first time I talked to her,
she knew everything about me.

31:21.088 --> 31:23.506
Names.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.466
She knew names.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.635
Have you ever heard
of caller I.D. and Google?

31:30.889 --> 31:33.975
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

31:35.644 --> 31:37.687
Can I talk to you?

31:53.787 --> 31:55.830
Did you get it?

31:55.914 --> 31:56.956
Tried.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.749
What happened?

31:58.834 --> 32:01.711
One of the security thingies went off
and I got busted for shoplifting.

32:01.795 --> 32:04.922
But I told you to take
the security tags off.

32:05.007 --> 32:06.841
I did.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.635
Must have missed one.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.685
It's okay.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.691
Did you, uh...
Did you say anything about me?

32:23.775 --> 32:25.151
- No.
- You sure? You sure?

32:25.235 --> 32:27.153
'Cause you can tell me.
Just tell me.

32:27.237 --> 32:28.237
I didn't.

32:30.824 --> 32:35.870
Ramsey, we need this money.
Your mom won't ask, but we need it.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.413
How bad does she need it?

32:38.957 --> 32:42.084
I told you, it ain't for us.

32:42.169 --> 32:43.919
Look at me.

32:44.004 --> 32:46.631
I come back from two back-to-back
tours in Iraq last year,

32:46.715 --> 32:48.341
and I got shit.

32:48.425 --> 32:51.260
No job, no degree,
no money... nothin'.

32:51.345 --> 32:55.348
All I have is respect,
and from you I'm gonna get respect.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.392
I asked you to do one thing,

32:58.477 --> 33:01.354
one stupid little thing...

33:01.438 --> 33:04.398
and you messed it up.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.151
What's this?
Where'd you get this?

33:07.986 --> 33:10.988
- A friend.
- Nice friend?

33:11.907 --> 33:13.366
Yeah.

33:17.746 --> 33:20.956
I wonder what you have to do for
a friend to get a phone like this.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.178
Don't mess up again.

33:45.607 --> 33:47.358
Your call has been forwarded

33:47.442 --> 33:49.360
to an automatic
voice-message system.

33:49.444 --> 33:52.238
Six-1-2-8-4-5-4.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.141
Would anyone like some more wine?

34:20.225 --> 34:21.934
- Yeah.
- I would.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.270
Your uncle and I are very happy

34:24.353 --> 34:27.523
to have a belated Christmas dinner
with the newlyweds.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.442
We're all glad you're here.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.110
Too bad your brother had to fly

34:32.195 --> 34:34.196
straight back to Wilmington
from Phoenix.

34:34.281 --> 34:37.867
Helen, you should see
the house he bought.

34:37.951 --> 34:41.911
Oh, John's work
is just going so well.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.206
His company
is exploiting Chinese children

34:44.291 --> 34:45.291
into making automotive paint.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.083
Here we go
with all the green talk again.

34:47.168 --> 34:50.880
We are proud of you too,
being a teacher.

34:50.964 --> 34:53.549
Why would...
That's not what I'm...

34:53.632 --> 34:55.676
Could somebody
please pass the Mrs. Dash?

34:55.761 --> 34:58.304
She might be hiding
with Mr. Dash.

34:58.388 --> 35:01.015
Oh, we don't know if there
is a Mr. Dash, Dad.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.643
Maybe things didn't go well
after their wedding or something.

35:04.728 --> 35:07.104
Well, maybe Mr. Dash
had some things on his mind,

35:07.189 --> 35:09.857
and things he had
to take care of.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.026
I just wonder if Mr. and Mrs. Dash
didn't go on a honeymoon

35:12.110 --> 35:13.694
and then after that
stopped communicating.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.529
Maybe Mrs. Dash should stop
feeling sorry for herself.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.324
I think that Mrs. Dash
is trying really hard

35:18.408 --> 35:20.576
- and maybe feels underappreciated.
- Maybe Mrs. Dash should remember

35:20.660 --> 35:22.995
she's not the only spice
in the spice rack.

35:23.079 --> 35:25.039
I'm not saying that Mrs. Dash
is the only spice.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.292
Mrs. Dash has gotten very arrogant
lately. Little one-sided.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.252
- Arrogant?
- Mm-hmm.

35:30.337 --> 35:33.088
There's paprika, there's thyme,
there's rosem... lot of other spices.

35:33.173 --> 35:35.966
I think maybe it's time
to clear the table.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.719
- I'll help you.
- No, no, Helen. Now, you sit.

35:38.804 --> 35:42.389
I only get to wash
the Christmas dishes once a year.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.058
Okay, this is it.

35:50.565 --> 35:53.567
We couldn't believe all those
strange-looking plants in Phoenix.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.236
What were they called again?

35:55.320 --> 35:57.279
Cactus, Helen.
They were cactus.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.532
They weren't cactus.
I know what cactus look like.

35:59.616 --> 36:01.784
They're succulents.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.832
Too bad about your...
your friend, Scott.

36:07.916 --> 36:10.960
Yeah. I'm sorry.
That's too bad.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.547
It was an unfortunate lesson
for all of us.

36:14.631 --> 36:16.924
Boy looked like
he was a lot of fun.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.677
He was a lot of fun, Roger.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.136
He wasn't a boy though.

36:21.221 --> 36:24.098
- He was a man.
- Of course he was a man.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.350
No, no, no.
He was a real man.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.477
Just because he drank
a little too much

36:28.562 --> 36:30.646
and quit law school
and he got fired from his job,

36:30.730 --> 36:34.275
it doesn't make him less of a man.
'Cause he was a man, Kris.

36:34.359 --> 36:37.111
Okay. We understand
and we know you're upset...

36:37.195 --> 36:38.654
You asked me to pee
sitting down!

36:38.738 --> 36:41.073
I thought it would be
a nice compromise.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.783
You wanted me to carry a purse,
for Christ's sake.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.828
- Why would he carry a purse?
- It was a man bag!

36:45.912 --> 36:48.706
And I was only pointing out that
some men have found it efficient.

36:48.790 --> 36:50.374
- They are in Europe, mostly...
- We don't live in Europe.

36:50.458 --> 36:54.753
This is what I'm talking about.
Lumpy kept it real.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.338
He was a man.

37:03.597 --> 37:06.181
I'm going to help Mom
in the kitchen.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.225
Good idea.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.980
Come on, Terry. This isn't even
gonna get me through New Years.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.190
Man, Terry! Hey.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.252
What?

37:35.337 --> 37:36.962
Nothing.

37:49.851 --> 37:51.977
Your aunt had to bring up Lumpy.

37:52.062 --> 37:55.564
Mom, someone died.
People are gonna talk about it.

37:55.649 --> 37:58.025
But that's all they talk about.

37:58.109 --> 38:01.612
Oh, your best man got drunk
and died at the wedding.

38:01.696 --> 38:04.406
Do you know that he hit
on your cousin Lindsay?

38:04.491 --> 38:07.409
She's 14.
They were just dancing.

38:07.494 --> 38:10.746
I think it's inappropriate.
I don't like it.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.209
Well, don't tell me
that you don't wish

38:15.293 --> 38:17.586
that it didn't happen
on your wedding night.

38:20.840 --> 38:26.428
Actually, I just wish
that it didn't happen.

38:38.525 --> 38:41.026
- Oh. Hey.
- I'm sorry. You're not a smoker.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.948
Should we leave tomorrow morning
after traffic?

38:46.032 --> 38:47.825
- Leave for where?
- Lutsen.

38:47.909 --> 38:50.536
What are you talking about?
Why would we drive to Lutsen?

38:50.620 --> 38:52.079
'Cause we have to
find Ramsey Anderson

38:52.163 --> 38:53.872
and tell her that
her boyfriend died.

38:56.584 --> 38:59.086
Kris, that's like five hours away.
It's near Canada.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.546
Why don't we just
call Ramsey Anderson?

39:00.630 --> 39:04.258
I tried. The phone's
been disconnected or something.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.260
I Googled. I Facebooked.
There's nothing.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.386
What about a home number?

39:07.470 --> 39:10.723
Do you know how many Andersons
there are in Northern Minnesota?

39:11.725 --> 39:13.308
So we're gonna drive to Lutsen

39:13.393 --> 39:15.519
and just ask around
for Ramsey Anderson?

39:15.603 --> 39:18.647
- Yeah.
- Why would we do that?

39:18.732 --> 39:21.316
Because Lumpy
was your best friend.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.293
Kris, can you take
your legs down, please?

39:39.377 --> 39:41.962
'Cause we get in an accident,
you're gonna get paralyzed.

39:42.047 --> 39:46.341
But we've passed, like, two cars
in the last 20 minutes.

39:47.927 --> 39:50.345
Can you just work with me, please?

39:50.430 --> 39:52.806
Come on.
We're newlyweds.

39:58.354 --> 39:59.813
Thank you.

40:01.941 --> 40:03.776
I need to pee again.

40:04.861 --> 40:06.320
Really?

40:06.404 --> 40:07.491
Yeah.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.248
Mom.

40:18.333 --> 40:20.459
There's someone at the door.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.883
Mom!

40:40.563 --> 40:42.189
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.732
Hi. Uh, I'm sorry
to bother you.

40:43.817 --> 40:46.360
Are your parents at home?

40:46.903 --> 40:47.903
Yeah.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.365
Great.

40:51.449 --> 40:52.783
Can I talk to them?

40:52.867 --> 40:54.952
Why?

40:55.036 --> 40:56.787
Okay.

40:56.871 --> 40:59.873
Uh, yeah, because I normally
cut through your neighbor's property

40:59.958 --> 41:02.376
to get down to the lake,
but they have it plowed so...

41:02.460 --> 41:04.837
Yeah, I think they took their
Winnebago to Florida for the winter.

41:04.921 --> 41:06.421
Do you think it would be okay

41:06.506 --> 41:09.424
if I just cut through
your property really quick?

41:09.509 --> 41:11.385
- Yeah. Sure.
- Really?

41:11.469 --> 41:14.012
- Rock it out.
- All right. Rock it out.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.142
You like these guys, huh?

41:19.352 --> 41:20.769
You know these guys?

41:20.854 --> 41:23.981
Yeah, I do.
A lot of people do.

41:24.065 --> 41:25.941
Not in this town.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.734
Oh, no, maybe not.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.403
Yeah. Probably right.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.572
Okay, I'll get out of your hair.
Thank you.

41:36.119 --> 41:37.870
Careful on the ice.

41:40.874 --> 41:42.416
Global warming.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.460
Thanks.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.945
Who was that at the door?

42:13.656 --> 42:16.825
- Who was that?
- Some guy.

42:16.910 --> 42:18.744
- What guy?
- I don't know. He's gone.

42:18.828 --> 42:21.455
Have you seen my cigarettes?

42:21.581 --> 42:23.749
Finished the pack at school.

42:23.833 --> 42:26.001
Don't be a smart-ass.

42:29.797 --> 42:33.967
So, uh, how was school anyway?

42:36.554 --> 42:38.222
I asked you a question.

42:41.184 --> 42:43.018
What are you doing?

42:43.102 --> 42:46.230
- I asked you how school was.
- How do you think it was? It sucks.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.149
- Why?
- Why do you think?

42:49.234 --> 42:51.318
I don't know, Ramsey.
That's why I'm asking.

42:51.402 --> 42:52.778
I hate it here.

42:52.862 --> 42:54.529
You never gave it a chance.

42:54.614 --> 42:56.823
No one makes new friends
in high school.

42:56.908 --> 42:58.951
Oh, you're so smart though.

42:59.035 --> 43:01.161
Yeah, and everyone's
just dying to be friends

43:01.246 --> 43:03.872
with that freak girl who does math
two years ahead of everybody else.

43:06.167 --> 43:09.795
Well, if you try,
it'll get better.

43:09.879 --> 43:11.296
You sure about that, Mom?

43:11.381 --> 43:13.507
Is it gonna get better
like Milwaukee,

43:13.591 --> 43:15.509
where I got beat up every week?

43:15.593 --> 43:17.010
Or is it gonna get better
like Rockford,

43:17.095 --> 43:18.470
where you got beat up every week?

43:18.554 --> 43:19.680
Stop it.
I did the best that I could.

43:19.764 --> 43:23.934
Or is it like Brooklyn Park,
where I had to watch my dad O.D.

43:24.018 --> 43:25.143
- Stop it!
- So tell me, Mom,

43:25.228 --> 43:27.521
when does it get better,
because I wouldn't want to miss it.

43:30.275 --> 43:32.734
Ramsey.

43:33.778 --> 43:35.821
- Where are you going?
- Anywhere but here.

44:39.802 --> 44:41.470
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:42.805 --> 44:44.306
Sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

44:44.390 --> 44:45.932
You didn't.

44:46.017 --> 44:47.642
Good.

44:51.689 --> 44:53.607
- How's it going?
- Good.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.443
Just, uh, you know,
gettin' started.

44:57.612 --> 45:00.280
I just wanted to make sure
you found it.

45:01.366 --> 45:02.741
The lake?

45:03.701 --> 45:04.910
Yeah.

45:04.994 --> 45:07.120
Yeah. Found it.

45:07.205 --> 45:09.664
It's right there.

45:10.458 --> 45:11.875
Cool.

45:15.421 --> 45:17.672
- See ya.
- See ya.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.179
Oh.

46:06.722 --> 46:09.724
Oh, yeah. Okay.

46:11.769 --> 46:13.311
Oh... Oh!

46:13.396 --> 46:16.356
Oh!
Oh, look at you!

46:17.233 --> 46:19.234
Ohh! Oh!

46:23.406 --> 46:24.781
Oh.

46:26.409 --> 46:27.581
Oh, shit.

46:29.706 --> 46:31.606
Oh, shit.

47:00.860 --> 47:03.445
Oh, God!

47:04.822 --> 47:06.865
Help! Help!

47:37.647 --> 47:39.481
Hold on!

47:59.794 --> 48:01.419
Come on!
You're almost there!

48:11.639 --> 48:12.889
I told you.

48:12.974 --> 48:15.684
Global warming.

48:15.768 --> 48:17.936
Oh, shit.

48:21.482 --> 48:23.400
It's a wintry mess here...

48:23.484 --> 48:25.402
I still think you should've
gone to the hospital.

48:25.486 --> 48:27.445
Mm-mmm. No, no.

48:27.530 --> 48:30.323
No, Duluth is, like,
two hours away from here.

48:30.408 --> 48:32.367
I took a hot shower.
I'll be fine.

48:32.451 --> 48:35.954
Well, you look purple
and bloated.

48:36.956 --> 48:38.498
I always look bloated.

48:41.502 --> 48:43.420
It's okay, it's okay.

48:43.504 --> 48:46.131
I work really hard
to look this bloated.

48:46.215 --> 48:48.216
It's a point of pride for me.

48:48.301 --> 48:49.551
Good evening.
I'm Michelle Lee.

48:49.635 --> 48:52.387
Mother Nature is once again
trying to put a damper on...

48:52.471 --> 48:54.556
Do you mind if I shower?

48:54.640 --> 48:57.851
- You want to take a shower here?
- I was on the ice too.

48:57.935 --> 49:00.145
- Remember?
- I do. I do. Yeah. Yeah.

49:00.229 --> 49:03.231
Uh, yeah.
Knock yourself out.

49:05.318 --> 49:07.235
Um...

49:07.320 --> 49:10.655
I think I should probably take you
home after that though. Okay?

49:12.366 --> 49:13.867
Are you sure?

49:13.951 --> 49:15.910
Uh, what would, uh...

49:15.995 --> 49:18.788
What would your family say
if they saw you here with me?

49:18.873 --> 49:21.458
We're not doing anything wrong.

49:21.542 --> 49:25.670
I just think that it would
probably be the right choice.

49:26.756 --> 49:28.423
Okay?

49:28.507 --> 49:30.634
Like it was the right choice
for me to risk my life

49:30.718 --> 49:32.260
saving a total stranger?

49:32.345 --> 49:36.306
I thanked you for that, like,
a hundred times. Didn't I? I mean...

49:36.390 --> 49:37.807
I just, uh...

49:37.892 --> 49:40.435
You want me to get out of here
'cause you got what you needed.

49:40.519 --> 49:42.646
- What?
- That's real fuckin' nice.

49:42.730 --> 49:45.106
Hey, you don't even know me, okay?

49:45.191 --> 49:47.150
A-And watch your mouth,
young lady.

49:47.234 --> 49:49.861
I know you. I know men.
You want money.

49:49.945 --> 49:51.571
You want sex. You want drugs.

49:51.656 --> 49:54.949
Whoa... What?
Wh-What are you talking... Hold on.

49:55.034 --> 49:57.369
I was just simply saying that
I think maybe you should...

49:57.453 --> 49:59.454
Get the hell out of here!
I heard you.

49:59.538 --> 50:02.707
Maybe if I get home in time, I can
still score some pharmaceuticals

50:02.792 --> 50:04.250
for my mom's boyfriend

50:04.335 --> 50:07.837
and we can all do some meth together
and watch cartoons.

50:10.341 --> 50:13.259
From the direction
of Eau Claire City...

50:16.889 --> 50:18.807
Hey, stop! Stop!
Hey, hey, hey!

50:18.891 --> 50:20.475
God bless America!
Stop!

50:20.559 --> 50:23.061
- You're gonna get pneumonia.
- I-I-I'm really sorry.

50:23.145 --> 50:25.855
I'm really, really sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

50:25.940 --> 50:27.107
Okay? Genuinely.

50:27.191 --> 50:30.318
All right, listen. Just, uh,
you know, come back inside.

50:30.403 --> 50:33.321
Let me at least put some clothes on
and I will drive you home.

50:33.406 --> 50:34.698
I can walk.

50:34.782 --> 50:37.909
Get your butt back in the hotel
room, or I'm gonna drop this towel!

50:39.412 --> 50:41.371
You'll be scarred for life.

50:48.546 --> 50:50.714
Good choice.

50:50.798 --> 50:52.924
Smart choice. Oh!

50:54.051 --> 50:55.593
Let me in.

51:02.017 --> 51:05.228
Now, the state patrol, as well as
local law enforcement agencies,

51:05.312 --> 51:06.688
are stepping up their...

51:06.772 --> 51:10.650
And, uh, you know,
I was gonna be a big-shot lawyer.

51:10.735 --> 51:13.987
I was gonna be,
you know, rich, have a...

51:14.071 --> 51:16.448
A house on the lake,

51:16.532 --> 51:20.243
and a different car for the winter,
a different one for the summer.

51:20.327 --> 51:24.998
But everything just... fell apart.

51:27.001 --> 51:29.002
Rough.

51:29.086 --> 51:30.503
Yeah.

51:33.090 --> 51:34.758
Anyway, uh...

51:34.842 --> 51:38.136
So, you, uh... you guys
just moved here, yeah?

51:38.220 --> 51:41.765
Me and my mom move around a lot.
I'm gettin' out of here though.

51:41.849 --> 51:43.099
You are? On your own?

51:43.184 --> 51:45.310
I'm filing for emancipation
this summer.

51:45.394 --> 51:48.021
- I'm gonna get my G.E.D., and...
- Whoa.

51:48.105 --> 51:50.482
I got a 1990
on my S.A.T.'s.

51:50.566 --> 51:52.859
No, you didn't.
They only go up to 1600.

51:52.943 --> 51:54.652
They changed it.

51:54.737 --> 51:58.031
They changed it.
Nobody ever tells me anything.

52:06.832 --> 52:08.333
So, um...

52:09.376 --> 52:11.419
what college you gonna go to?

52:12.755 --> 52:14.964
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

52:15.049 --> 52:17.050
You gotta go to college.

52:17.134 --> 52:19.302
It's sort of expensive.

52:19.386 --> 52:21.262
Yeah.

52:21.347 --> 52:24.557
- Open up. Cook County Sheriff.
- What? No. No way.

52:24.642 --> 52:27.435
- Oh, my God. Put your shoes on.
- Wait...

52:28.521 --> 52:30.647
- Ho! Whoa!
- On the floor.

52:30.731 --> 52:32.273
Okay, okay. Okay.

52:33.609 --> 52:35.109
Okay.

52:45.246 --> 52:47.163
We should stop and ask.

52:47.248 --> 52:51.459
This is why we should have gotten
a G.P.S. Take you right there.

52:52.336 --> 52:55.338
Hey.
"Lutsen, 25 miles."

52:55.422 --> 52:57.131
All right.

53:03.639 --> 53:04.931
Yeah?

53:05.015 --> 53:06.850
- Hi. Miss Anderson?
- Maybe.

53:06.934 --> 53:09.936
I'm Scott Thomas.
This is my wife Kristin.

53:10.020 --> 53:11.145
We're friends of Lumpy's.

53:11.230 --> 53:13.314
Hi.

53:13.399 --> 53:16.150
W-We have bad news, I'm afraid.

53:16.235 --> 53:17.944
Who's Lumpy?

53:18.028 --> 53:20.405
Aren't you Ramsey Anderson?

53:20.489 --> 53:22.323
No, that's my daughter.

53:22.408 --> 53:23.992
Your daughter?

53:24.076 --> 53:26.995
- Is she home?
- How old is your daughter?

53:27.079 --> 53:29.956
Um, look, I don't know
who you people are, but...

53:30.040 --> 53:33.376
- You're friends of Lumpy's?
- Who is Lumpy?

53:33.460 --> 53:34.794
Mom, it's cool.

53:34.879 --> 53:37.005
You know these people?

53:38.215 --> 53:39.716
Sort of, yes.

53:39.800 --> 53:41.968
Fine.
I gotta go to work.

53:46.432 --> 53:50.518
I'm sorry about that.
She's tired.

53:50.603 --> 53:53.605
- You guys can come in.
- Thanks.

53:59.028 --> 54:01.237
Um...

54:01.322 --> 54:04.365
I'm afraid we have
some bad news, Ramsey.

54:06.076 --> 54:08.578
Lumpy passed away this week.

54:08.662 --> 54:11.706
There was an accident
at our wedding, and it was...

54:11.790 --> 54:14.250
It was very sudden for everyone.

54:14.335 --> 54:16.711
So we wanted to tell you.

54:16.795 --> 54:18.129
What happened?

54:18.213 --> 54:20.924
Well, he, uh...

54:21.008 --> 54:24.344
He fell in the desert.
He fell and he hit his head.

54:24.428 --> 54:27.764
And he... he died.

54:27.848 --> 54:29.933
We don't know what, exactly,

54:30.017 --> 54:34.145
your relationship was with Lumpy.

54:34.229 --> 54:37.315
It's none of our business, so...

54:37.399 --> 54:40.652
No, but we want you to know
that you can talk to us.

54:44.281 --> 54:48.159
I should probably get going
actually, if that's cool.

54:48.243 --> 54:50.119
- Oh.
- Sorry.

54:50.204 --> 54:51.663
Okay.

54:51.747 --> 54:54.207
Well, would you like the details
for the funeral service?

54:54.291 --> 54:56.834
'Cause it's gonna be Monday
in Minneapolis and...

54:56.919 --> 54:58.419
That's okay.

55:00.172 --> 55:01.923
- Okay.
- Okay.

55:03.300 --> 55:05.927
Okay.
Um...

55:09.306 --> 55:13.101
Sorry you guys had to
drive all the way up here.

55:13.185 --> 55:16.980
I'm just glad we were able
to tell you.

55:19.316 --> 55:21.025
Nice to meet you.

55:32.204 --> 55:34.247
- What was that?
- I don't know.

55:34.331 --> 55:37.583
She acted like
she didn't even know him.

55:37.668 --> 55:39.752
They're gone?

55:40.963 --> 55:43.297
Yeah. It was just
a misunderstanding.

55:46.343 --> 55:50.263
Danny gets all bent out of shape
if I'm five minutes late.

55:50.347 --> 55:53.307
If you see Winston,
tell him I'll be off at 1:00.

55:56.145 --> 55:57.729
Is everything all right?

55:59.148 --> 56:00.690
Yeah, I'm fine.

56:16.874 --> 56:18.249
Smile.

56:18.333 --> 56:19.959
Hmm?

56:22.129 --> 56:25.173
You never smile.

57:10.052 --> 57:12.345
Can't we just
drive back tonight?

57:12.471 --> 57:14.722
Oh, come on.
Please, no.

57:14.807 --> 57:16.933
It's so cold.
I'm tired.

57:17.017 --> 57:19.936
Let's just order a pizza
and crash here.

57:20.020 --> 57:22.021
It just seems like
a waste of money.

57:22.106 --> 57:23.981
Waste of money?

57:24.066 --> 57:27.527
It's, like, 39 bucks a night.

57:27.611 --> 57:29.612
Think we can still swing that.

57:29.696 --> 57:31.906
Mmm.

57:40.541 --> 57:42.041
What are you doing?

57:42.126 --> 57:44.502
I'm gonna check for bedbugs.

57:51.093 --> 57:52.552
Um...

57:56.932 --> 57:58.474
I quit my job.

57:59.476 --> 58:01.686
- What?
- Yeah.

58:01.770 --> 58:04.021
Quit. Done.
Quit my job.

58:06.275 --> 58:08.442
Rick wouldn't give me
the commission yet again,

58:08.527 --> 58:10.444
so I finally called his dad...

58:10.529 --> 58:12.446
Please tell me
that you're joking.

58:12.531 --> 58:14.073
Nope.

58:14.158 --> 58:18.536
And, uh, Rick Senior tells me
that I'm not a team player.

58:18.620 --> 58:21.873
You quit your job now?

58:21.957 --> 58:23.875
Why are you saying it like that?

58:23.959 --> 58:25.751
You're the one
that said they were crooks.

58:25.836 --> 58:28.129
Yeah, they are, but I didn't
say "quit your job."

58:28.213 --> 58:30.298
We have a wedding to pay for!

58:30.382 --> 58:34.218
Well, you're the one
that bought a $2,000 dress.

58:34.303 --> 58:36.429
It was 3,000.

58:37.514 --> 58:39.140
Oh, Jesus, Kris.

58:39.224 --> 58:41.267
- Oh, my God.
- You have to get your job back.

58:41.351 --> 58:44.478
I can't get my job back!
I don't want to get my job back!

58:44.563 --> 58:47.315
Keep shafting me
on commissions, and I'm done.

58:47.399 --> 58:49.692
That's what Lumpy
would have done.

58:49.776 --> 58:52.695
Oh, well, by all means
let's follow Lumpy's example.

58:52.779 --> 58:55.114
What has he done?
He dropped out of law school.

58:55.199 --> 58:56.824
He got fired for embezzlement.

58:56.909 --> 58:58.826
Now I think he's committed
statutory rape!

58:58.911 --> 59:01.746
Stop it! Please don't.
Just don't.

59:08.545 --> 59:10.880
You know how we could
afford Mexico?

59:12.549 --> 59:14.508
Lumpy gave me the money.

59:15.594 --> 59:17.511
He got us a honeymoon,

59:17.596 --> 59:20.514
and I can't even
get his funeral right.

59:21.558 --> 59:23.643
You never told me that.

59:25.562 --> 59:27.521
He asked me not to tell you.

59:33.528 --> 59:36.948
- Wh-Where are you going?
- I'm gonna find us some food.

59:43.247 --> 59:45.539
I don't care.

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:09.146
Get away!

01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:11.983
Stop!

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:17.655
Ow. Ow!
My hand's burning.

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:19.824
Ow!

01:00:21.994 --> 01:00:24.578
What'd you do? Oh!

01:00:25.831 --> 01:00:29.250
Ramsey. No.
Not in front of her, no.

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:31.877
I'm... Hey!
It's okay, baby.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:34.338
- Not in front of my little girl!
- Calm down.

01:00:34.423 --> 01:00:37.383
Why... Get out of here!
Get out!

01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:42.972
I don't want her
to see. I don't want her to see.

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:45.057
It's all right.

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:16.797
Where'd you get muffins in Lutsen?

01:01:16.882 --> 01:01:19.342
They're just Hostess cupcakes.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.762
Well, it's still
a pretty good effort.

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:27.808
I'm sorry. I am so sorry
about the honeymoon and the job.

01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:29.977
No. No.

01:01:30.062 --> 01:01:33.356
I should be apologizing to you.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.316
You did the right thing.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:39.612
I promise you
we're gonna have a honeymoon.

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:42.615
We're gonna have a...
a great honeymoon.

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:44.450
I know.

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:51.457
I need a ride.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.794
To the funeral.
Can I go with you guys?

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:58.547
Uh, sure.

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:00.508
Yeah, we can drive you
to Minneapolis.

01:02:00.592 --> 01:02:03.177
But how you gonna get back home?

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:06.263
I don't know.
I'd take the bus or something?

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:08.849
I think we should
figure that out before...

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:10.142
- Yeah...
- I'm pregnant.

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:15.106
It's Lumpy's.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:18.526
I knew it.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:21.654
I have to go to the funeral.
Lumpy would have wanted me...

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:26.158
I mean, us to be there.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:33.416
- Why can't we just leave?
- Because that would be kidnapping.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.919
- So we're gonna ask your mom.
- Remember our deal.

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:39.422
Yeah, I won't say anything about
the pregnancy to your mom.

01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:41.674
And I won't mention it
at the funeral.

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:43.467
Perfect.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.684
- Mom.
- Hi again.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.686
- They shouldn't be here.
- Mom, it's okay.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.939
We just came to ask if we could
take Ramsey to Minneapolis.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:03:00.067
- What's he talking about?
- It's for the funeral.

01:03:00.152 --> 01:03:03.279
No one is taking
my daughter anywhere.

01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:04.613
It's for Lumpy.

01:03:04.698 --> 01:03:07.032
I don't care what it's for.
I don't even know you.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:08.826
We're friends of...

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.870
Friends of a mutual friend, Lumpy.

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:13.164
Yeah? Lumpy?

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:16.625
You were going, uh...

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.545
Going off with some Lumpy guy?

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.714
- Where did you find those?
- Doesn't matter.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:23.799
You went through my room
and dug through my stuff.

01:03:23.884 --> 01:03:28.721
I'm your mother! I can go through
what the... the hell I want to!

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:31.515
Who'd you bring in this house?
This about last night?

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.809
No, listen,
everything's totally cool.

01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:36.520
We just came here to ask you guys
if we could take Ramsey

01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:38.606
to a funeral for our friend Lumpy.

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:39.899
Who?

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:42.526
- Let's just... We should go.
- No. I'm coming with you.

01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:44.737
Yeah, listen. I'm just trying
to respect the wishes

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:48.574
- of a friend who passed away.
- I don't care what you're doing.

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:49.950
- Get the hell out of here.
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:52.161
- We gotta go.
- Baby, what are you doing?

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:53.871
Social Services.
That what this is?

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:55.498
No! Oh, no, no, no.

01:03:55.582 --> 01:03:57.750
He's in real estate.
I'm a third grade teacher.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.335
Yeah.

01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:01.378
Wh-Where did you get that?

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:04.840
I promise you, there's no reason
for that, okay? E-Everything's fine.

01:04:04.925 --> 01:04:08.302
We just... We have a mutual friend
who passed away.

01:04:08.386 --> 01:04:09.762
We're just going to a funeral.
That's it.

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:12.681
- I told you to leave!
- Okay.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:14.767
Okay. We'll go.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.811
Baby, it's okay.

01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:20.981
Maybe they're right. Maybe Ramsey
should go to the funeral.

01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:23.776
Ms. Shirley said that it was okay.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.152
- Ms. Shirley?
- Yeah.

01:04:25.237 --> 01:04:28.906
She said that maybe it's a good time
for you to start traveling.

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:31.408
You know, seeing other pl...
Hold on.

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:39.458
- How long you gonna be gone?
- I don't know.

01:04:39.543 --> 01:04:41.627
Um, the funeral is tomorrow,

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:45.839
so we can put her on a bus
by Monday night, Tuesday morning.

01:04:47.676 --> 01:04:49.552
Here.
I want you to have it.

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:54.723
I want you to know we're gonna
take really good care of her.

01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:56.642
It's only for a couple days.
We'll have her back.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.519
- Make sure.
- Yeah, we will.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:04:59.645
- We should go.
- Okay.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:02.231
I'm sorry again about
all the confusion and, um...

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:05.150
I-I-I didn't catch your name.

01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:09.238
Um, you know what?

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:12.533
I-I'm just gonna leave you
a business card there.

01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:17.788
That's me and my cell number, if you
need to get in touch, check in.

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:19.206
Okay.

01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:29.133
I love you.

01:05:45.233 --> 01:05:47.443
Jesus.

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:50.404
It's only gonna be two days.

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:28.859
S-So, how often would Lumpy
come and visit you, Ramsey?

01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:32.863
Almost every weekend.

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:34.865
Really?

01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:38.619
And, um, your mom
never met him?

01:06:39.704 --> 01:06:42.039
We hung out
at the motel mostly.

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:43.749
Huh.

01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:52.925
So, you guys just got married
four days ago?

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:55.302
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

01:06:55.387 --> 01:06:57.638
Aren't you supposed to be
on your honeymoon or something?

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:58.722
Mmm.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:01.934
Yeah, supposed to be...

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:05.104
Lying under a palm tree
in a caftan, sipping a mojito.

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:07.981
What's a caftan?

01:07:10.318 --> 01:07:12.695
Never mind.

01:07:13.822 --> 01:07:15.864
So...

01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:17.408
No honeymoon.

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:19.952
- Nope.
- Hmm.

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:21.995
Waste of a perfectly good
boob job.

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:24.998
You got a boob job?

01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:28.669
- No, I did not, Ramsey.
- I was just kidding.

01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:30.421
I didn't think so.

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:37.553
I need a Xanax.

01:07:37.637 --> 01:07:39.972
- Again?
- What do you mean? "Again"?

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:42.182
What do you mean, "again"?

01:07:42.267 --> 01:07:45.227
- You took one earlier.
- Yeah.

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:46.729
- Did I?
- You did.

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:49.314
My mom says taking drugs
for fun is okay,

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.984
but taking them for problems is not.

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:55.154
'Cause once the drugs wear off,
you still have the problem.

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:56.989
Yeah.

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:02.494
Why'd you quit your job?

01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:05.748
Wh... Huh?
Why'd I qui...

01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:07.332
Oh.

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:10.002
It's a long story, Ramsey.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:12.004
Hmm.

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:14.673
We got two hours
till Minneapolis.

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.888
Yeah.

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:28.145
Pop'll kill you.

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:31.273
We have green tea.

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:40.073
Ever had goji berries?

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.246
Oh.

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:49.124
Well, they're filled
with antioxidants.

01:08:49.209 --> 01:08:52.502
Well, I'm 15.
I don't need antioxidants.

01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:58.050
That's Lumpy's
ultimate fighting phase.

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:01.345
- Lumpy fought?
- Mmm.

01:09:01.429 --> 01:09:03.555
Only with Jim Beam.

01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:08.644
Hey, is this picture
from the Wisconsin Dells truck?

01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:10.312
Yeah.
How'd you know that?

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:13.732
He talked about you guys
all the time.

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:21.782
- What's wrong?
- That was the coroner.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:24.368
Uh, apparently Lumpy
didn't bleed to death.

01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:27.371
- He had a heart failure.
- What?

01:09:27.455 --> 01:09:30.332
Yeah. It had nothing
to do with the cactus.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:34.670
- He had a heart attack?
- He had a heart attack.

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:37.256
The coroner said
it was like, um,

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:40.843
you know, when young athletes
just collapse on the field.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:44.763
Did you know that Lumpy
had a heart condition?

01:09:44.848 --> 01:09:46.890
I don't think Lumpy knew
he had a heart condition.

01:09:46.975 --> 01:09:48.350
He knew.

01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:53.145
He knew about his heart.
He had I.H.S.S.

01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:54.773
How do you know?

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:56.275
He told me.

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:57.776
What's I.H.S.S.?

01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:01.655
Uh, idiopathic hyper...

01:10:02.574 --> 01:10:05.617
Something-something.
It's pretty rare, probably genetic.

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:09.121
So Lumpy told you
he had a heart defect?

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.623
I just said that.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.459
What else did he tell you?

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:18.338
- Lots of things.
- Yeah? Like what?

01:10:18.423 --> 01:10:21.133
- Like, why do you care?
- I-I-I'll tell you why.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:24.636
Because I don't know what he's doing,
where he's working, who he's dating.

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:26.847
I don't really know anything
about the guy, as it turns out.

01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:28.724
- Neither do I.
- Oh, n...

01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:30.976
I think you knew him
pretty well, actually.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.853
Did Lumpy know about the baby?

01:10:32.937 --> 01:10:34.563
- Scott...
- No, no, no. Did he?

01:10:36.274 --> 01:10:38.525
- Did Lumpy know about the baby?
- I don't know!

01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:42.112
You don't know if you told your
own boyfriend you were pregnant?

01:10:46.367 --> 01:10:49.077
I mean, what the hell?
What if she got pregnant on purpose?

01:10:49.162 --> 01:10:50.162
She's just a girl.

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:51.538
What if that made
his heart thing worse?

01:10:51.623 --> 01:10:53.165
- It doesn't matter.
- Of course it matters!

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:56.752
- What are you talking about?
- He's gone, Scott.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:00.047
I know that. I just...

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:05.844
He told a 15-year-old girl
he was dying. He didn't tell me.

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:10.807
I just wish he'd told me.

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:22.611
Oh, I wish he had told me.

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:45.509
You told me you would never
involve her in the drugs.

01:11:46.594 --> 01:11:48.261
You promised.

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:52.599
We all make our sacrifices.

01:11:52.684 --> 01:11:54.267
Yeah.

01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:58.438
You know what I think?
I think she got caught on purpose.

01:11:58.523 --> 01:12:02.025
And I'm gonna have a little talk
with her when she gets back.

01:13:58.059 --> 01:14:00.268
- Scott.
- Hi, Gail.

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:02.854
I am so sorry.
So sorry.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:05.232
- He was just way too young.
- He was.

01:14:05.316 --> 01:14:06.817
- Hey, Roger.
- Hi, Scott.

01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:08.068
Uh, I gotta...

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:11.988
So, don't you look pretty.

01:14:12.073 --> 01:14:15.033
I like your hair like that.

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:18.495
- Have you taken any pills today?
- What?

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:23.250
Well, your father and I
are very worried about you and drugs.

01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:24.626
Oh, my God.

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:27.379
- Honey, we love you very much.
- Yes, we do.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:30.173
My God.
This is about Neil on the plane?

01:14:30.258 --> 01:14:34.678
Yes, Neil did say something to his
mother, and he's only trying to help.

01:14:34.762 --> 01:14:35.762
This is so ridiculous.

01:14:35.847 --> 01:14:38.515
I thank the Lord
that he did say something.

01:14:38.599 --> 01:14:41.309
Because otherwise I wouldn't know
that you have a problem.

01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:43.436
- I don't have a problem!
- Honey, a-all right.

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:46.022
- Don't get excited.
- We're gonna talk about this later.

01:14:46.107 --> 01:14:47.524
- Yeah, that's good.
- That's right.

01:14:47.608 --> 01:14:50.026
- We'll talk about it later.
- Please go sit down.

01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:52.529
- Just no drugs today.
-  Mother!

01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:55.407
Honey.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:56.950
What is going on?

01:14:57.034 --> 01:15:00.537
I... I can't talk about it.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:02.414
Okay.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:52.130
My name is Ramsey Anderson.

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:55.467
I know a lot of you probably don't
know who I am or how I knew Lumpy.

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:56.968
Oh, God.

01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:59.095
It's sort of a long story.

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:02.766
Lumpy had a minor heart attack
a year and a half ago.

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:06.561
And the doctors told him
there was no way to know for sure,

01:16:06.646 --> 01:16:09.606
but they didn't think he would live
more than a year or two.

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:12.609
He had I.H.S.S.
It's a heart defect,

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:16.488
which means the walls of his heart
were hard and thick.

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:20.283
And knowing Lumpy,
that's difficult for me to believe.

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:23.745
He didn't tell anyone
about his heart

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:26.623
because he didn't want
his friends or family to worry.

01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:29.042
And if he only had
a little time left to live,

01:16:29.126 --> 01:16:31.920
the last thing he wanted to be
was a lawyer.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:35.715
He just wanted to fish
and have fun.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.427
But then he met me.

01:16:42.974 --> 01:16:45.892
What's this?
My last rites already?

01:16:45.977 --> 01:16:48.520
We're dropping the charges.

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:50.522
The girl told us what happened.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:52.899
We went out to the lake,
saw where you fell through.

01:16:52.984 --> 01:16:53.984
You're lucky.

01:16:54.068 --> 01:16:57.570
Lumpy started visiting me,
um, twice a month,

01:16:57.655 --> 01:17:00.031
and then every week.

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:03.535
And he'd come up and I'd do
my homework in his motel room,

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:06.579
or we'd go fishing.

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:11.418
It was fun.

01:17:12.503 --> 01:17:14.587
It was always fun with Lumpy.

01:17:15.923 --> 01:17:17.465
I know this sounds weird,

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:20.552
but he was the first real friend
I ever had.

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:25.557
But when things got worse
for me at home,

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.892
he decided he had to do something.

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:30.895
So you want Ramsey
to move to Minneapolis with you?

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.522
Yeah. Why not?

01:17:32.606 --> 01:17:34.774
She could start at the "U"
a year early.

01:17:34.859 --> 01:17:37.444
She aced her S.A.T.,
and she gets good grades.

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:38.945
She's also 15 years old.

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:42.574
Yeah. And you know
what's going on inside that house.

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.534
She's gotta get out.

01:17:44.618 --> 01:17:47.120
You might be right,
but you're not her parent.

01:17:47.204 --> 01:17:51.750
Then help us convince her mother
that it's the best thing for Ramsey.

01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:53.752
What if something happens to you?

01:17:55.046 --> 01:17:57.422
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

01:17:58.466 --> 01:18:00.216
You sure this is what you want?

01:18:01.761 --> 01:18:03.678
Yeah.

01:18:03.763 --> 01:18:06.181
I want to leave.

01:18:10.978 --> 01:18:13.980
But we never got to
that part of the plan.

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:19.319
There are a lot of moments in life,

01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:21.780
and I didn't know Lumpy
very long.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:25.075
Most of you probably had more time
with him than I did,

01:18:25.159 --> 01:18:28.995
but just because dying on a cactus
was Lumpy's last moment

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:32.165
doesn't mean it was
his most important one.

01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:40.757
I loved my friend
and the moments we had.

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:44.844
I loved Lumpy.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.882
That was really good,
what you said in there.

01:19:24.969 --> 01:19:27.595
And I know Lumpy
would have liked it.

01:19:31.559 --> 01:19:35.520
When I yelled at you yesterday,
that wasn't about you.

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:38.773
But I had no right to do that,
and I'm... I'm very sorry.

01:19:38.858 --> 01:19:41.484
I've been yelled at
a lot worse.

01:19:41.569 --> 01:19:44.571
That doesn't really
make me feel better.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:49.159
I'm not pregnant.

01:19:49.243 --> 01:19:52.412
Yeah, I kinda figured that out.

01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:54.831
Lumpy was a great guy.
He never would have...

01:19:54.915 --> 01:19:56.916
I know. I know.

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:03.047
What's he doing here?

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:05.967
Rick?
You know Rick?

01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:08.553
That's Rick?

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:11.139
Rick the Realtor Rick?
The one that took your commission?

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:12.765
Yeah. But...

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:15.310
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'll be right back.

01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:16.769
Hey.

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:19.564
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:22.567
Can I talk to you
about a friend of mine?

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:24.652
He's like a father to me.

01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:34.787
Jaime!

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:39.250
I had to wait
45 minutes out there.

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:45.215
Jaime?

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:23.086
I wanted to tell you
I'm really sorry about your son.

01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:24.796
Thank you.

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:28.383
I have something for you.

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.803
When I went to
Lumpy's apartment,

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:34.472
I found this with your name on it.

01:21:37.101 --> 01:21:38.977
This is your money.

01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:42.188
It's an advance to help
with your transition to Minneapolis.

01:21:42.273 --> 01:21:44.816
I put the rest
in a safe deposit box.

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.442
Why are you doing this?

01:21:46.527 --> 01:21:50.154
If Lumpy wanted you to start college
early, that's what you should do.

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:52.198
You'll probably have to get
a part-time job,

01:21:52.283 --> 01:21:55.368
but that should go a long way
towards tuition.

01:21:55.452 --> 01:21:57.370
I don't know what to say.

01:21:58.497 --> 01:22:00.665
You know, I always felt bad

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:03.793
my son never met anyone to love,

01:22:03.877 --> 01:22:06.754
someone to love him back.

01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:10.425
It's really good to know
that I was wrong.

01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:58.431
- Hon.
- Oh.

01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:03.311
What is this?
Looks like a wedding gift?

01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:05.438
I don't know.
Just came today.

01:23:05.522 --> 01:23:06.939
Open it.

01:23:12.946 --> 01:23:16.115
"Knew you always wanted one of these.
Love, Lumpy."

01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:23.247
It's a robe.
He knew you always wanted a robe?

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:25.124
It's not a robe.

01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:27.627
- Looks like a robe.
- What is it?

01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:32.256
It's a caftan.

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:39.013
It's... It's a caftan.

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:45.645
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she's good.

01:23:47.398 --> 01:23:50.942
Uh, I guess I should
find my way home.

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:54.028
Is there a bus station
around here somewhere?

01:23:54.113 --> 01:23:56.656
Uh, your mom
called this morning.

01:23:57.908 --> 01:23:59.075
She did?

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:03.454
Yeah. She left Lutsen.

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:06.874
She's left a lot of towns.

01:24:12.631 --> 01:24:14.173
You know, I...

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:19.971
I-I honestly think
this is good for her.

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:22.390
I-I think it's good for you too.

01:24:22.474 --> 01:24:24.976
Anyway, I know
she wants to get help.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.437
Where is she?

01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:29.021
I don't know.

01:24:33.819 --> 01:24:35.570
We're gonna figure this out.

01:24:35.654 --> 01:24:38.740
- Where am I supposed to go?
- You stay here for now.

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:40.992
- With you?
- Yeah.

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:44.078
You guys just got married.
You don't want me here.

01:24:44.163 --> 01:24:46.914
We talked about it, okay?

01:24:46.999 --> 01:24:48.916
Stay here.

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:51.669
- For how long?
- For as long as it takes.

01:24:57.968 --> 01:25:00.720
Lumpy had good taste in friends.

01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:05.433
Besides, I think I owe you one.
I don't know what you said to Rick.

01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:08.978
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

01:25:09.062 --> 01:25:10.897
"Nothing" got me my job back?

01:25:13.192 --> 01:25:16.444
I just promised
I'd help him out with something.

01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:18.696
Oh, God. What?

01:25:18.781 --> 01:25:21.783
You know what?
I don't want to know, do I?

01:25:21.867 --> 01:25:25.036
- Probably not.
-  Okay.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.872
Well, we'll table it.

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.416
- You hungry?
- Starving.

01:25:30.501 --> 01:25:32.084
Come on.

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:35.087
- Hello.
- Hi.
