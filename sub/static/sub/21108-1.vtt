00:24.941 --> 00:27.193
I was, like, "You know what?
If you're gonna fuck with me,

00:27.277 --> 00:29.154
l'm gonna have you killed."

00:29.237 --> 00:31.906
But then that guy was like,
"I don't know if I can handle it."

00:31.990 --> 00:35.577
And I was like, "Of course you can't!
Nobody can handle the heat!"

00:35.660 --> 00:37.579
You guys know. I bring heat.

00:37.662 --> 00:40.331
Buddy, it's broken glass,
so don't touch it.

00:41.416 --> 00:44.544
Yeah... No, don't walk around
with your shoes off.

00:44.627 --> 00:46.045
Okay.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.965
All right, buddy, I gotta go.
Tonight's the big show.

00:49.048 --> 00:51.134
Okay. I love you. All right, bye.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.803
All right.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.681
So I had that guy fucking killed.
I had him fucking killed.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.683
And that guy
was a theater owner too, right?

00:58.767 --> 01:01.644
Yeah, that guy was the theater owner.
He was the owner of the theater.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.438
Now he's dead.

01:03.521 --> 01:06.316
What, do you got Zika?

01:06.399 --> 01:11.196
Hey. Bob. Theater owner. You guys
can start the show whenever you're ready.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.322
Crowd sounds electric.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.783
Yeah! Why wouldn't they?

01:16.201 --> 01:18.912
Well, I trust you guys
to know where the stage is.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.498
Obviously we know how to get to the stage!

01:21.581 --> 01:23.583
Jesus Christ!

01:23.666 --> 01:24.751
Cheers.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.131
Ah.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.134
Yeah!

01:33.218 --> 01:34.677
Let's rock!

01:35.762 --> 01:37.263
Whoo!

01:51.528 --> 01:53.738
âŞ You know that man âŞ

01:53.822 --> 01:55.990
âŞ He's a hell of a man âŞ

01:57.617 --> 02:01.412
âŞ He's a bad motherfucker
With a mike in his hand âŞ

02:03.164 --> 02:06.209
âŞ Pimpin' stages all over the world âŞ

02:06.292 --> 02:09.419
âŞ Stackin' paper
Gettin' all the girls âŞ

02:09.503 --> 02:11.589
âŞ When you see him walking by âŞ

02:11.673 --> 02:13.716
âŞ You better step aside âŞ

02:14.467 --> 02:18.012
âŞ Rory âŞ

02:18.096 --> 02:19.264
Ahh.

02:20.849 --> 02:24.185
âŞ Rory âŞ

02:26.646 --> 02:30.066
Yeah!

02:31.317 --> 02:33.444
Oh, my God. Rory!
Can I get your autograph?

02:33.528 --> 02:34.821
Yeah... No!

02:34.904 --> 02:36.531
Get the fuck away from me!

02:36.614 --> 02:37.574
l'm sorry.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.410
Oh, God, you are so fucking cool.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.870
Yeah!

02:41.953 --> 02:43.163
No fucking shit.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.206
Mike! Let's go.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.749
See that?

02:46.833 --> 02:47.959
Remember it.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.675
âŞ Rory âŞ

03:05.143 --> 03:08.021
âŞ Rory âŞ

03:08.104 --> 03:09.898
Rory. Rory.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.441
Hey, good luck tonight, Mr. Scovel.

03:11.524 --> 03:16.279
Rory. Rory. Rory. Rory.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.615
What'd you just say to me?

03:18.698 --> 03:20.116
Just saying good luck.

03:20.992 --> 03:21.910
Yeah.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.287
I don't need your luck, pal.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.873
- I love you.
- Me too.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.459
Now I gotta go rip some dicks off.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.794
Rory! Rory!

03:34.881 --> 03:37.091
Yeah!

03:37.175 --> 03:39.260
Whoo!

03:39.344 --> 03:41.346
Yeah!

03:44.140 --> 03:47.894
Whoo! Whoo!

03:47.977 --> 03:54.192
Yeah!

03:54.275 --> 03:56.027
Whoo-hoo!

04:02.742 --> 04:03.826
What's... What's happening?

04:03.910 --> 04:05.787
Gilbert's gonna bring you on stage soon.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.414
What... Hey, Scott, hold on.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.709
- What do I do when I get out there?
- I don't know. We'II figure it out.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.720
Okay, this next guy is a comic.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.932
Uh, everybody give it up for...

04:27.058 --> 04:29.060
Cory Scravin!

04:48.162 --> 04:49.539
Thank you.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.000
Thank you!

04:52.834 --> 04:54.961
Thank you, Atlanta!

04:55.461 --> 04:57.297
Thank you, Atlanta!

04:58.131 --> 04:59.882
Thank you!

04:59.966 --> 05:04.220
Thank you, Atlanta.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.930
Thank you, 'Lanta.

05:06.014 --> 05:09.475
Thank you, 'Lanta.
I did the research. I know the nicknames.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.603
Thank you so much, 'Lantans,
coming out tonight.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.898
Coming down to 'Lanta. Coming out
to see the show. Thank you so much.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.276
Let's get right into it.
Anal. Who's done it?

05:18.359 --> 05:25.533
Who's done anal? Who here has done anal?

05:25.616 --> 05:27.118
This is the show. Who has...

05:27.201 --> 05:29.245
Earlier it was like,
"Wait. So is this the show?"

05:29.329 --> 05:32.457
This is the show. This is the show.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.167
Anal. Who's done anal?

05:34.250 --> 05:36.878
But, like, anal. Anal, though.

05:36.961 --> 05:37.879
Anal.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.214
Who has done anal?

05:40.298 --> 05:42.967
I have one joke,
and l'm halfway through it.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.555
This is... This is it.

05:47.638 --> 05:50.224
I do sort of a reverse Louis CK.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.351
I write one new joke a year.

05:54.228 --> 05:56.814
And this is actually
a three-year-old joke.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.525
So, should be a pretty good special.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.278
You guys made a good choice, watching.
Thanks for being here.

06:02.987 --> 06:06.449
Ah, anal. We're still...
This is still... Anal.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.618
Anal. Anal.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.995
Does that sell it if that's my posture?

06:11.079 --> 06:12.622
Anal!

06:12.705 --> 06:14.707
Who's done anal?

06:15.833 --> 06:19.128
l'm the brattiest comic on the circuit!

06:19.212 --> 06:21.881
Who's done anal though?

06:27.136 --> 06:29.180
"Butt-fuck." Does that help?

06:29.263 --> 06:30.473
Does that help?

06:30.556 --> 06:32.725
Does that help though? Butt-fuck.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.186
Some people...
"Oh, butt-fuck. Okay, yeah.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.772
Okay.

06:37.855 --> 06:42.527
Yeah, dude said "anal,' I was like,
"Who's the doctor-lawyer on stage?'

06:43.361 --> 06:45.279
Anal? What?

06:46.072 --> 06:48.825
Butt-fuck. That's more my speed."

06:48.908 --> 06:50.827
That's more my style!

06:50.910 --> 06:53.329
Truth be told, that's more my style.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.498
I butt-fuck!

06:55.581 --> 06:56.916
Wanna know somethin' about me? I butt..."

06:56.999 --> 06:59.210
You have to say "butt-fuck"
with an accent.

07:01.003 --> 07:05.049
If you say it without an accent,
you sound like a goddamn serial killer.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.343
"You guys ever butt-fuck?"

07:08.553 --> 07:10.763
"Oh, my God.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.516
Karen, put your fucking hand down!

07:13.599 --> 07:15.643
It's obviously a trap.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.311
It's a death trap."

07:17.395 --> 07:19.230
"Well, I don't know.

07:19.313 --> 07:21.774
l've never been to one of these things."

07:24.569 --> 07:26.696
"Yeah, whatever. Butt-fuck!"

07:26.779 --> 07:29.907
Isn't that... It's kinda... Immediately
you're, like, "Oh, that's not so bad."

07:30.658 --> 07:34.662
"Y'all ever butt-fuck?"
"Hey, it's the guy from the gas station!

07:35.955 --> 07:37.957
Answer his inquiries."

07:38.583 --> 07:41.502
"I just wanna know
if y'all ever butt-fucked before!

07:42.420 --> 07:44.255
Y'all come on now!

07:44.964 --> 07:47.133
Unleaded, fill it up? You got it!

07:48.259 --> 07:49.594
You ever butt-fucked?"

07:51.345 --> 07:53.514
"Hi. l'd like to fill it up.
l'm over on pump ten.

07:53.598 --> 07:56.851
I gotta tell you, that one employee,
he is a lively sort.

07:56.934 --> 08:00.104
What's that? That's not an employee?
l'II be right back.

08:00.188 --> 08:04.108
No, it's on me. There were a lot
of red flags, and I... I should've...

08:04.192 --> 08:06.360
I should've tuned in. Should've tuned in."

08:08.196 --> 08:10.156
"Y'all ever butt-fucked?

08:10.239 --> 08:11.324
Butt-fuck!"

08:15.411 --> 08:17.872
My wife and I tried anal sex once, and...

08:17.955 --> 08:19.957
Shut the fuck up!

08:20.041 --> 08:21.125
Shut up!

08:24.754 --> 08:27.924
I already asked you if you did it.
Nobody said shit.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.927
And now I have to talk the entire show.

08:33.554 --> 08:34.804
This job sucks.

08:37.933 --> 08:41.562
Right now some people are like,
"Maybe he does only have the one joke.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.650
Where we thought he was being facetious."

08:45.733 --> 08:48.402
The twist in tonight's show was honesty.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.030
Hmm.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.951
My wife and I tried anal sex once,
and I didn't like it,

08:55.034 --> 08:57.620
and for some reason
I feel like that makes me a gentleman.

08:59.038 --> 09:02.291
Huh? That's pretty cool, babe.
We don't have to go down that road again.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.878
Lord knows you hated it. All the tears.

09:08.297 --> 09:10.925
If your wife cries during sex,

09:11.008 --> 09:13.135
she is telling you something.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.596
Check in. You know what I mean?
Do a check-in.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.306
"You okay?" Just one of those.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.058
"Hey, everything cool? What's going on?

09:19.600 --> 09:21.644
Got a little misty here. I don't..."

09:21.727 --> 09:24.313
Also, talk like that.
That's a big turn-on for women.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.107
That's a huge turn-on for women.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.608
"Hey, just a quick question!

09:29.735 --> 09:31.946
What's going on with the tears?"

09:34.156 --> 09:36.826
Be that... Be that ecstatic.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.202
"Hey!

09:39.161 --> 09:41.664
What's the deal with the tears?

09:43.165 --> 09:44.875
Let's get back into it!"

09:49.088 --> 09:50.881
Where did I lose some people?

09:52.341 --> 09:56.971
The visualization of my wife crying
during anal sex?

09:57.054 --> 10:00.141
Is that where some people were like,
"You know what? No.

10:00.224 --> 10:02.852
No, next exit. We'II take the next exit.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.354
l'm not here for this."

10:09.275 --> 10:11.861
If you've ever tried it, that's one thing.
Fine. You tried it.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.531
You ever try to try it?
You know what I mean?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.533
You know what l'm talking about?

10:17.617 --> 10:20.536
That means you're about to try it,
and then you stop and you're like,

10:20.620 --> 10:22.330
"I can't pull this off.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.999
Who do I think I am?

10:26.375 --> 10:29.545
Just 'cause I see it
in all the laptop movies.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.174
That doesn't mean I know what l'm doing."

10:33.257 --> 10:36.594
It's tough to do. It's like trying
to get a lime into a Corona.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.642
Your first thought is always,
"Who cut these?

10:45.645 --> 10:48.064
Didn't they know
what I was gonna do with this?"

10:49.732 --> 10:51.901
It'II go. It'II go.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.778
Know what I mean? It'II go.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.864
Like, it will go. You gotta want it.

10:56.947 --> 10:58.991
You have to want some things.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.535
It'II go if you want it bad enough.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.540
Yeah, my jacket's a problem
for a lot of people.

11:09.126 --> 11:13.214
l'm not stupid. I caused this problem.
I fucking know what's going on.

11:13.297 --> 11:14.965
I don't have to look at it.

11:15.049 --> 11:19.387
That's how much of a dick I am.
I know that you have to look at it.

11:19.470 --> 11:23.766
Oh, so many people are already like,
"Ahh! Unzip it!

11:25.393 --> 11:27.478
Unzip it! Or buy your size!

11:27.561 --> 11:29.939
You know what I mean? You're fucking...

11:30.022 --> 11:33.776
How badly do you need to fit in?
You're 36. The dream is over."

11:36.028 --> 11:38.823
This? Oh, fuckin'... That shirt?

11:38.906 --> 11:41.992
That shirt flap?
That's the worst part of it all.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.703
All the way around. Just that extra...

11:44.787 --> 11:47.790
Hi! l'm shirt flap!

11:47.873 --> 11:50.084
Oh, that's the cringeworthy part there.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.920
Oh, God.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.505
Some people are like, "Tuck it in."

11:54.588 --> 11:56.424
I can't.

11:56.507 --> 11:59.844
I tuck it in, I look like an undercover
cop who coaches Little League.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.597
"Get two, Kev! Kev, get two!

12:03.681 --> 12:06.809
Kev, you gotta get down.
You gotta slide, Kevin!

12:07.560 --> 12:09.687
Your dad was shit too!

12:09.770 --> 12:12.106
We played together. You'II never go pro."

12:12.857 --> 12:14.525
He's that hard on the players.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.193
"You'II never fucking go pro, dude.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.904
You don't know how to fucking slide?

12:18.988 --> 12:21.991
l'II go back to my dugout in a second.
I wanna talk to your team.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.744
You're shit.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.037
You are shit.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.291
We have seven of you on my team.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.961
Yeah, you hear me?
We got seven of you.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.130
Some of you guys might go pro.

12:36.213 --> 12:37.673
Not you, Kev.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.804
What'd you say?
What did you fuckin' say to me, Kevin?

12:43.888 --> 12:45.598
l'm a goddamn cop.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.312
This is my cover.

12:51.896 --> 12:54.648
My cover is
aggressively coaching Little League."

12:57.693 --> 13:01.572
I did a show once... I did a show once
where I had a hoodie on,

13:01.655 --> 13:04.992
and I pulled the string on one side
all the way down to my knee,

13:05.075 --> 13:07.661
and I left a little bit on this side.

13:08.162 --> 13:11.165
People didn't even see the show.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.376
The rage in their eyes...

13:14.460 --> 13:16.921
It's like, "No!

13:17.671 --> 13:19.673
We paid to be here!

13:20.216 --> 13:21.550
Fix it!"

13:22.134 --> 13:25.012
I was just twirling it around.
"So, l'm married."

13:26.472 --> 13:27.765
Like, whipping it.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.267
"Marriage is fun."

13:32.978 --> 13:36.190
Oh, what does that do?
What's that do for some people?

13:39.777 --> 13:41.612
Does that help anyone? Does that help?

13:41.695 --> 13:43.781
Is there anybody who is like,
"I didn't like it,

13:43.864 --> 13:47.409
but if you go a little deeper
l'm okay with it"?

13:48.160 --> 13:50.204
Just leave it like that for a little bit.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.374
I can't even use the pocket.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.001
Hi! Yeah. Table for one.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.295
Yeah, table... M-Me again.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.422
Me again. Table for one.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.883
My "yoush."

14:03.717 --> 14:06.762
Put me on my "yoush,"
my one high-top place.

14:07.555 --> 14:10.015
It's not even comfortable
to use the pocket.

14:10.432 --> 14:11.475
Hi!

14:14.562 --> 14:16.689
In three years
Kanye's gonna invent this jacket,

14:16.772 --> 14:18.983
and then everyone's gonna be like,
"Oh, now I like it."

14:19.775 --> 14:22.319
You laugh at me now,
but then you respect it three...

14:22.403 --> 14:24.238
"Now I think it's cool."

14:24.321 --> 14:27.032
Bullshit. I set the trend.
Look at this shit.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.286
"Oh, remember? Remember Kanye,
he's got that new jacket.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.914
Remember we saw that comic.
He wore his jacket like that first."

14:33.998 --> 14:35.457
"No, I don't... I don't remember."

14:35.541 --> 14:38.168
"You don't remember?
He killed himself two days later."

14:39.128 --> 14:40.629
You don't remember that?

14:40.713 --> 14:44.174
He said if we didn't laugh at every joke,
he was gonna kill himself.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.760
And that was the one joke
he wasn't joking about.

14:48.178 --> 14:50.681
Remember he had the suicide note
in calligraphy,

14:50.764 --> 14:53.517
so you know he wanted to do it.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.604
Probably took him two weeks to write it.
He thought it out."

14:58.022 --> 15:01.233
My suicide note is just gonna be
the "Thong Song" lyrics.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.696
People will discover my body.
They're like, "Oh, my God!"

15:05.779 --> 15:08.073
"Thong, th-thong-thong-thong."

15:08.157 --> 15:11.327
"Hmm. Why so much SisqĂł on the way out?"

15:14.330 --> 15:17.833
If you're thinking of killing yourself,

15:17.917 --> 15:21.128
why not try autoerotic asphyxiation

15:21.211 --> 15:24.131
and see what all the jazz is about!

15:24.632 --> 15:26.008
We're all curious.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.052
We're not gonna do it.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.970
"What if I accidentally kill myself?"

15:30.054 --> 15:33.432
But if you already want to die,
give it a go.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.851
See what it's like.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.186
What if it's amazing?

15:37.269 --> 15:39.730
What if it's so amazing, you're like,
"I think I wanna live"?

15:41.732 --> 15:43.651
"Suicide saved my life."

15:44.526 --> 15:46.820
Coming this fall to CBS.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.573
Suicide Saved My...

16:01.293 --> 16:04.922
I love... I love it when... I love it
when people bow too appropriately.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.173
It's so gross.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.353
Just bow. Just be like, "Okay, thanks."

16:21.188 --> 16:23.649
No, but you guys were right
to applaud there.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.988
Everybody watching at home, I assume
you also gave me a standing ovation.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.367
No, the crowd didn't give me a standing
ovation, but at home it's easier to do.

16:34.660 --> 16:38.163
Do a standing ovation, they'd be like,
"While l'm up, might as well take a piss."

16:39.123 --> 16:41.500
"Honey, should I pause it?"
"No, I think I get it.

16:42.876 --> 16:45.004
I think I get most of what he does."

16:48.465 --> 16:50.884
Remember, like, ten years ago
someone would be, like,

16:50.968 --> 16:54.930
"I saw a documentary,"
and we'd all be like, "Nerd!"

16:55.514 --> 16:57.433
Now if someone's like,
"I saw a documentary,"

16:57.516 --> 17:00.978
it's like, "Of course you did.
How else can you keep up socially?

17:01.061 --> 17:03.814
You've gotta see all the documentaries
to know what's going on,

17:03.897 --> 17:07.483
and what did go on,
and what will more than likely go on."

17:10.654 --> 17:13.991
Did you guys see that O.J. documentary?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.618
How did more people not see that?

17:17.703 --> 17:19.454
It's incredible.

17:19.538 --> 17:22.082
His one friend he grew up with,
with the raspy voice?

17:24.042 --> 17:25.836
Know who l'm talking about? That dude...

17:25.919 --> 17:27.628
"O.J...

17:29.882 --> 17:31.258
Growin' up...

17:32.342 --> 17:34.553
O.J. was always murderin' people.

17:36.096 --> 17:39.099
I was like,
"O.J., you can't be murderin' pe...'"

17:39.183 --> 17:41.935
His voi... What did he do for the...
Why? Why was...

17:42.019 --> 17:43.562
"O.J."

17:43.645 --> 17:46.940
His whole life his friends are like,
"I don't... You gotta speak up."

17:47.399 --> 17:48.817
"O.J.!

17:51.945 --> 17:54.323
I don't think O.J. killed Nicole.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.867
I think he killed Ron Goldman.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.162
And then Nicole
accidentally killed herself."

18:00.829 --> 18:02.915
Like, he has the shittiest theories.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.709
"I mean, I think Nicole and Ron...

18:06.668 --> 18:08.128
killed O.J.,

18:09.546 --> 18:11.548
and then the two of them,

18:12.674 --> 18:14.802
together..."

18:14.885 --> 18:17.888
"embodied what we now know as O.J."

18:19.556 --> 18:22.976
The documentarian's like,
"I can't use any of this footage.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.146
I can't use any of this.
Where did you even get that?"

18:26.230 --> 18:28.357
"I don't... I don't know.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.527
I haven't seen him in, like, 35 years.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.488
He might have done it... Actually,
he might... He did it. He did it."

18:37.116 --> 18:40.244
I don't think we even need
some of these documentaries.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.913
Like, The Planet Earth and Life.

18:42.996 --> 18:45.999
Like, who is that optimistic
about our intellect...

18:46.667 --> 18:48.252
as people?

18:48.335 --> 18:49.628
Like, we're not there yet.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.464
I don't need to learn about a species
at the bottom of the ocean

18:52.548 --> 18:54.383
l'm never gonna interact with.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.385
Let's pull it back.

18:56.468 --> 18:59.596
Let's do some documentaries about
some simple shit. You know what I mean?

18:59.680 --> 19:02.307
How does this microphone even work?
None of us know.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.560
None of us know.
None of us have ever known.

19:04.643 --> 19:09.064
Our entire life since we were kids...
"That's the voice stick boom machine."

19:11.108 --> 19:13.110
If someone asked me,
"How do you think it works?" l'd be,

19:13.193 --> 19:16.530
"Well, I guess the sound
kinda drifts over the metal cage.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.991
Then the metal cage is like,
"Get in here!'

19:19.825 --> 19:23.704
Then it just goes through the sound hose."

19:24.121 --> 19:26.623
Blaaaaah!

19:28.333 --> 19:30.127
That's my best guess.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.755
l'm 36.

19:34.339 --> 19:38.969
My best guess is something a child would
just rattle off the top of their head,

19:39.052 --> 19:41.680
in their first time ever
thinking about it.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.807
"I don't know. I guess it just...
Blu-Blah-Blu-Aaaah!"

19:43.891 --> 19:47.936
Like, okay. Well, either you're advanced,
or you're heading down the wrong road.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.317
Oh, concrete?

19:55.986 --> 19:58.113
Sorry to turn this into a TED talk.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.451
What the fuck is concrete?
You know what I mean?

20:02.534 --> 20:05.996
Like, liquid soupy shit,
then it's hard forever?

20:06.705 --> 20:08.665
It's just hard forever.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.584
Okay, Illuminati.

20:10.667 --> 20:13.003
Okay. Okay.

20:15.088 --> 20:18.717
"Good luck transporting me
in a normal truck. It won't work.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.554
You have to put me in a cartwheel
funnel truck that's always in motion.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.682
l'm high maintenance. l'm concrete."

20:26.350 --> 20:28.727
You could ask people who work in concrete,
"How does it work?"

20:28.810 --> 20:30.562
"You know what? I don't even...

20:31.188 --> 20:33.398
Just, like, it's liquid soupy stuff,

20:33.482 --> 20:35.943
and then it's just all of the buildings,
you know.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.904
It's literally all of the buildings."

20:42.241 --> 20:45.118
You ever ask a friend
how a record player works?

20:45.202 --> 20:47.287
Like, "Well, the needle grabs the sou..."

20:47.371 --> 20:49.289
"The wh-what?

20:49.373 --> 20:51.208
Fuckin' listen to yourself!

20:51.291 --> 20:54.044
"The needle grabs the sound'?

20:54.127 --> 20:56.546
What does that even mean?"

20:56.630 --> 20:59.341
"Well, there's grooves in the vinyl,
and the nee..."

20:59.424 --> 21:02.344
"What is happening in the grooves

21:02.427 --> 21:05.639
that the needle is aware of and grabbing?

21:05.722 --> 21:08.475
What physical thing
is happening in that..."

21:08.558 --> 21:11.186
The show is now over. The show is over.

21:12.020 --> 21:14.856
Turn off the fake cameras.
We won't need 'em.

21:15.482 --> 21:18.235
We're just gonna rant
and get to the bottom of stuff now.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.867
Ultimate Frisbee. That's still going on.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.121
You guys ever watch Ultimate Frisbee?

21:29.204 --> 21:31.206
What does that say about you?

21:31.999 --> 21:33.667
What are you even watching?

21:33.750 --> 21:36.503
Watching someone on defense, like,
"Don't you throw that Frisbee!"

21:38.338 --> 21:41.800
Somebody on offense, like,
"I have to, Jason! Get out of the way!

21:41.883 --> 21:44.052
Jason, get out of the way!

21:44.136 --> 21:46.805
The game is to throw the Frisbee."

21:49.933 --> 21:53.145
Every time someone asks me
to throw the Frisbee, I say yes.

21:53.228 --> 21:56.398
And then my brain's like, "Dude,
you don't fuckin' know what you're doing."

21:57.816 --> 22:00.736
I think you're either great at Frisbee
or you're all like me,

22:00.819 --> 22:02.696
where for every throw you're like,

22:02.779 --> 22:04.823
"Oh, please, God, just go.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.368
Get somewhat near the person.

22:09.286 --> 22:10.704
Sorry!"

22:10.787 --> 22:13.415
You yell "l'm sorry" super fast. "Sorry!"

22:14.833 --> 22:17.753
Right before you release it.
"So sorry! There!"

22:20.380 --> 22:23.633
You ever go to throw the Frisbee
and it's immediately sideways?

22:25.635 --> 22:27.512
Can't have those moments back.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.851
Just go to throw it and you're like, "No!

22:33.518 --> 22:34.770
Fuck!

22:34.853 --> 22:36.646
That's not me!

22:37.481 --> 22:38.982
That's not me."

22:42.694 --> 22:45.655
You ever see somebody
throw the Frisbee like this?

22:45.739 --> 22:49.159
Nobody's getting laid off of Frisbee, pal.

22:49.242 --> 22:51.036
Put it away.

22:53.872 --> 22:59.461
Nothing wrong with your classic
1950s-style discus toss.

23:02.089 --> 23:06.301
Plenty of children were conceived the
night of a toss like that being witnessed.

23:06.843 --> 23:09.054
"Oh, look at this guy throw it."
"Neil, go deep!"

23:12.140 --> 23:14.142
"Ooh, great angel follow-through."

23:15.018 --> 23:17.771
"Hey, what are you ladies
getting into tonight? There it is!"

23:23.235 --> 23:25.445
"Did you see that guy throw that Frisbee?

23:26.488 --> 23:31.493
Ooh. I hope I get the opportunity later
to suck his dick a little bit.

23:33.370 --> 23:38.333
Anyone who's innovating
the Frisbee pass at that level,

23:38.416 --> 23:42.587
that's the kind of dick
I like to suck a little bit of.

23:43.713 --> 23:46.883
If I get the opportunity.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.594
There's gonna be a line, l'm sure."

23:55.058 --> 23:56.476
Nice.

23:57.894 --> 24:00.147
I know a guy you should meet over here.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.482
You got that laugh,
this guy's got this I...

24:02.566 --> 24:05.819
Would you watch it
if this was my set? "Anyways...

24:08.155 --> 24:10.532
What else is goin' on?

24:10.615 --> 24:13.493
Uh, anyways, you ever had a meatball sub?"

24:17.747 --> 24:19.499
All right, all right, all right.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.084
Let's get this...

24:21.168 --> 24:23.587
Let's turn the cameras on. Let's do it.

24:25.672 --> 24:28.967
I usually like to run about
20, 30 minutes to an hour,

24:29.050 --> 24:30.886
and then I like to actually tape it.

24:34.723 --> 24:38.685
l'm gonna do a couple election-type jokes
for you all, if that's...

24:39.811 --> 24:42.022
I know...

24:42.105 --> 24:44.149
I know people...

24:44.232 --> 24:47.736
I know people, wherever you're
watching this, whenever it is you're like,

24:47.819 --> 24:51.031
"Wait, the election's already happened.
We already know the results."

24:51.114 --> 24:53.867
Guess what.
Everybody in this room, we don't know.

24:53.950 --> 24:56.578
So look at us.
Look how happy we used to be.

24:58.705 --> 25:00.332
We used to be so happy.

25:01.583 --> 25:02.959
Then it all fell apart.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.503
I, personally, am very excited,

25:05.587 --> 25:08.340
because this election
is about inspiration.

25:08.423 --> 25:11.509
When Barack Obama was elected,
he was the first black president.

25:11.593 --> 25:12.761
That's inspiring.

25:12.844 --> 25:16.097
If Hillary Clinton wins this election,
she's the first female president.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.307
That's inspiring.

25:17.390 --> 25:21.811
If Donald Trump wins this election, that's
inspiring for your average Joes like me.

25:21.895 --> 25:25.273
l'm not walking around, assuming
I have a shot at the presidency.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.443
But now it's like, I don't know.
He did it, you know?

25:30.111 --> 25:32.405
What is it? I fill out a form?

25:33.907 --> 25:37.369
Do I send in a tape?
How do I start the process?

25:39.037 --> 25:40.705
You also gotta be optimistic.

25:40.789 --> 25:45.210
I mean, if he does win, we're all
gonna get to die at the same time.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.673
That's a special you can't buy.

25:49.756 --> 25:52.676
You're either born in that time
or you're not.

25:52.759 --> 25:55.387
It was the dinosaurs, and now it's us.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.764
That's awesome.

25:57.847 --> 25:59.349
That's so cool.

26:00.350 --> 26:03.103
What a way to go. You know what I mean?

26:03.186 --> 26:07.274
Like, right now if you die you're like,
"But all my friends are still alive!

26:08.441 --> 26:11.278
Aw, everybody's going out to eat!"

26:13.280 --> 26:16.074
Let's... Let's just...
Let's admit something right now.

26:16.157 --> 26:19.661
You know that's the most adrenaline
we get at this age.

26:19.744 --> 26:22.372
"Hey, we're going out to eat tonight."
"What? I can go too?"

26:24.374 --> 26:28.211
"Bottle of wine for the table?
We're skydiving without parachutes now."

26:29.838 --> 26:32.340
I wanna be socially present
for these conversations,

26:32.424 --> 26:34.342
but l'm doing math the whole time.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.678
How are we splitting this bill?

26:36.761 --> 26:39.764
Is Kathy pitching in? Does she pitch in?

26:43.435 --> 26:46.479
Who here is in their 20s?
Anybody here in their 20s?

26:46.563 --> 26:48.732
Yes!

26:48.815 --> 26:51.776
Get some whoo's and some claps.

26:51.860 --> 26:55.530
Soak it up. Enjoy it.
I mean that. l'm not trying to be a dick.

26:55.613 --> 26:59.909
l'm saying you have something right now
and you need to embrace it.

26:59.993 --> 27:03.371
I know you're like,
"I go out. I fuckin' stay out so late.

27:04.539 --> 27:07.667
I stay out till like 3:00 or 4:00.
I fuckin'... I shut it down.

27:08.501 --> 27:09.794
I shut it down.

27:10.587 --> 27:12.130
I do so many shots.

27:12.213 --> 27:14.841
Oh, you should see me.

27:15.592 --> 27:18.178
I do so many fuckin' shots.

27:18.261 --> 27:21.931
You wanna know what separates me
from the herd the most?

27:22.015 --> 27:23.892
All the shots that I do.

27:24.851 --> 27:27.228
So many, I can't even stop.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.814
I force 'em on other people.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.317
You do one with me. You have to!

27:32.400 --> 27:34.069
We have to do it together.

27:34.152 --> 27:37.697
And I hope it tastes gross
so we can see who can handle it the best."

27:41.534 --> 27:44.412
A shot is the only thing that, when it
tastes like garbage, everyone's like,

27:44.496 --> 27:46.331
"Now, that's a real drink."

27:47.374 --> 27:49.376
If food was like that,
you wouldn't eat the food.

27:49.459 --> 27:53.254
"You know what? If it tastes like garbage,
that's how you know it's good."

27:55.632 --> 27:58.468
"I just did a shot, and it tasted
exactly like an apple pie."

27:58.551 --> 28:00.553
"That's 'cause you're a fuckin' pussy."

28:02.180 --> 28:04.182
Who wouldn't want to drink an apple pie?

28:09.729 --> 28:12.774
Yeah, when you're 30 and up,
oh, it's over.

28:13.775 --> 28:14.984
It's not even your choice.

28:15.068 --> 28:17.737
You think you can just keep doing it,
but you can't.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.532
Your body starts to get involved.

28:20.615 --> 28:24.244
Your body's like, "What's that?
Wanna do a slice of pizza at 2:00 a.m.?

28:25.203 --> 28:26.413
All right.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.416
Okay.

28:29.916 --> 28:32.127
Good luck. Good luck.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.711
Good luck, dude.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.672
Good luck.

28:35.755 --> 28:40.135
Hope you're ready to get up at 3:45 with
fuckin' scorched earth right through here.

28:42.637 --> 28:46.015
Yeah, go get your Tums.
Go get your Tummies.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.684
Go get your Tums.

28:47.767 --> 28:49.811
"I need my Tums!'"

28:51.438 --> 28:53.565
When you're in your 20s
and you have a hangover, you're like,

28:53.648 --> 28:55.650
"God, I need some Advil and water."

28:55.734 --> 28:58.611
In your 30s, that's like
throwing darts at a tank.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.572
And you only had three drinks.

29:00.655 --> 29:04.743
One of 'em wasn't even alcohol. But it
was soda, and l'd been off it for so long.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.834
Well, if someone told you

29:12.917 --> 29:16.296
that you could go out
and stay out as late as you want

29:16.379 --> 29:19.007
and drink for free every single night

29:19.090 --> 29:22.635
or pay $20 to go to bed at 8:00 p.m.,

29:24.971 --> 29:29.893
you would put down $40
just to make sure it definitely happened.

29:29.976 --> 29:33.813
You'd be like, "There's double. Let's not
fuckin' fuck me over on this, dude.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.815
l'm not talking, like, get ready at 8:00.

29:35.899 --> 29:39.235
I mean, at a quarter till
we're picking out our jammies.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.947
When 8:00 rolls around I wanna
almost be there. You know what I mean?

29:43.031 --> 29:44.866
l'm almost asleep! Leave me alone!"

29:47.494 --> 29:49.954
I get old people now. Like, I get it.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.831
Growing up, I didn't understand
my grandparents.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.666
I didn't get it. Now I get it.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.169
"We have dinner at 4:30."

29:56.252 --> 29:58.046
"Why wouldn't you?"

30:03.009 --> 30:07.263
Dinner at 4:30. Bed at 6:00.
Up at 2:00. See the world!

30:07.347 --> 30:10.308
See the entire world.
That's the only way you're gonna do it.

30:10.391 --> 30:12.185
The only way you're gonna do it
is to be up at 2:00.

30:12.268 --> 30:14.938
'Cause when you're waking up at 2:00...
Yeah!

30:16.064 --> 30:19.567
My grandfather would be on the porch
to catch the morning paper

30:19.651 --> 30:22.654
and then yell out,
"Why have I been waiting a half hour?"

30:25.907 --> 30:27.492
That's an explorer.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.832
Look, all l'm trying to say is,

30:33.915 --> 30:36.835
if we all die at the same time,

30:36.918 --> 30:39.170
that's like nobody died.

30:39.963 --> 30:43.508
If Trump wins this election, you guys,
we're all gonna live forever.

30:45.718 --> 30:49.264
And the sad thing is, that might be
a real slogan you hear before November.

30:49.848 --> 30:53.434
"Vote for me, everybody lives forever."
Like, "What? Okay.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.894
And recess will be longer?

30:54.978 --> 30:58.523
This guy knows something
the rest of us don't know.

30:59.607 --> 31:01.234
I like it."

31:03.611 --> 31:07.115
If I could have it my way, l'd say let's
get another Kenyan for four more years.

31:07.198 --> 31:08.950
You know what I mean?

31:12.245 --> 31:14.080
Yeah. Huh.

31:14.163 --> 31:18.585
Some people are like, "That's where the
jokes stopped and the manifesto started."

31:18.668 --> 31:21.504
Also, people applauding to that joke,
it's kind of a mixed signal.

31:21.588 --> 31:24.757
It's like, do you think
he's not an American citizen?

31:24.841 --> 31:26.593
Are you agreeing with my sarcasm,

31:26.676 --> 31:29.679
or do you not interpret my sarcasm?

31:29.762 --> 31:32.098
"Yes! Get another Kenyan!"

31:34.225 --> 31:36.144
I know Barack Obama is a US citizen.

31:36.227 --> 31:39.105
A lot of people don't think he is.
One of those people might be president.

31:39.188 --> 31:41.900
So if you're not scared now,
think about it.

31:43.192 --> 31:46.362
I kinda like imagining
that he's not a US citizen.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.865
To be the first black president
in this country,

31:48.948 --> 31:50.867
with the shit that this country's
been through,

31:50.950 --> 31:53.578
and the current racial tension
in this country,

31:53.661 --> 31:55.830
to be the first black president,
that's amazing.

31:56.664 --> 31:59.208
But on top of it,
to not even be a US citizen?

32:00.126 --> 32:01.127
What?

32:01.210 --> 32:03.588
l'm sorry. What?

32:03.671 --> 32:05.256
That's astounding!

32:05.340 --> 32:09.135
It's your job
until you don't want it anymore.

32:09.218 --> 32:13.139
If he really was not a US citizen, it's
like, "Well, you got us, so it's yours.

32:13.222 --> 32:15.892
Obviously we're not qualified to do it.

32:15.975 --> 32:17.393
It's yours, dude."

32:20.021 --> 32:23.274
If he truly is not a US citizen,
can you imagine

32:23.358 --> 32:25.735
night number one with Michelle
in the White House?

32:25.818 --> 32:28.112
He's like, "Can you fucking
believe this shit?"

32:29.906 --> 32:33.284
I was joking! I was joking.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.119
I never thought it would go this far.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.246
I genuinely never thought
it would go this far.

32:39.499 --> 32:42.835
Michelle's like, "What are we gonna do?
What the fuck are we gonna do?

32:44.545 --> 32:47.840
Just go make an announcement...
Just kidding... and we'II get out of here."

32:47.924 --> 32:51.260
"Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Calm down."

32:51.344 --> 32:54.138
If you knew that was a scene that actually
happened in the White House you'd be,

32:54.222 --> 32:56.057
"Let's give 'em 12 years.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.893
They're that adorable?
Twelve years it is."

33:03.398 --> 33:07.235
I would love it if, on his last day,
he just comes out and he's like,

33:07.318 --> 33:09.654
"I gotta come clean
about something with you guys.

33:10.488 --> 33:12.907
I am not even a US citizen."

33:14.450 --> 33:16.911
Wouldn't all of us, even if you hated him,

33:16.995 --> 33:20.707
would be like, "Get the fuck out, Barack!

33:20.790 --> 33:21.916
What?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.876
You son of a bitch!

33:23.960 --> 33:26.671
You're good! You're good, dude.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.798
You're good. You're the tops.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.136
How did you do that? We looked into it.

33:33.219 --> 33:38.224
You are literally the only president
we ever looked into it about."

33:41.936 --> 33:45.523
Nothing racist about that.
Let's keep moving on, you know?

33:46.190 --> 33:48.192
Scoop it under the rug.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.403
No aftereffects. You guys know.

33:54.407 --> 33:56.451
If you think it's so easy,
you guys do that.

33:56.534 --> 33:58.870
That's my declaration to everybody.

33:58.953 --> 34:00.872
If you think it's so easy
to fuckin' pull that off,

34:00.955 --> 34:05.501
you go to another country
and you get as far as president.

34:06.669 --> 34:11.340
You won't even get as far as solicitor
because none of us know what that is.

34:11.424 --> 34:12.800
We've never known.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.719
Every time you get into a voters' booth,
you're like, "Solicitor?

34:15.803 --> 34:18.014
All right. Who's got the cooler name?

34:19.474 --> 34:21.225
I don't know."

34:21.309 --> 34:24.478
You don't know what solicitors do.
You don't know what mayors do either.

34:24.562 --> 34:28.190
You thought you did growing up.
You're like, "A mayor runs the town.

34:28.274 --> 34:30.568
I saw it in a Richard Scarry book."

34:34.572 --> 34:36.991
Then Marion Barry gets caught
smoking crack in the '90s.

34:37.074 --> 34:40.119
People are like,
"What? But he's the mayor!"

34:40.203 --> 34:42.871
Then Rob Ford in Toronto,
he gets caught smoking crack.

34:42.955 --> 34:45.833
Maybe we, as people, need to step back

34:45.917 --> 34:49.295
and ask ourselves,
"Do mayors smoke crack?"

34:50.838 --> 34:53.341
They might all be smoking crack.
We don't know.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.134
We don't know what they do.

34:56.177 --> 34:58.513
We don't fuckin' know.
That's what they do.

34:58.596 --> 35:00.681
These two just happened to get caught.

35:01.140 --> 35:04.018
You know how not everybody
in this room has a DUI,

35:04.102 --> 35:06.437
but we've all been eligible for one?

35:07.688 --> 35:11.484
It's like that, except it's crack.

35:11.567 --> 35:14.070
And it's an elected government official.

35:14.153 --> 35:16.447
Otherwise, it's the same thing.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.533
That's what they do.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.744
They walk around smoking crack,

35:21.828 --> 35:23.830
carrying their big scissors.

35:26.082 --> 35:29.043
You can't find those scissors anywhere.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.337
That's the biggest crime of it all.

35:31.420 --> 35:33.172
Where do you get those things?

35:33.923 --> 35:36.551
Some of you are like, "Look on Etsy."
I did.

35:37.135 --> 35:40.012
It's the only research I did
in this entire show.

35:41.597 --> 35:43.766
I could have googled "solicitor."

35:43.850 --> 35:45.601
I don't give a fuck.

35:46.352 --> 35:48.312
Get me to the scissors gold.

35:49.647 --> 35:52.233
Here, cut the ribbon
with these normal scissors.

35:52.316 --> 35:54.152
No!

35:54.235 --> 35:56.362
It'II never work.

35:56.445 --> 35:59.198
They'II never be able to get through
this kind of silk.

36:00.241 --> 36:05.705
I need my giant scissors if we're ever
gonna open the skate park conservancy.

36:10.084 --> 36:13.379
I also don't know
what a skate park conservancy is,

36:13.462 --> 36:16.632
but it's fun to say, and people laugh,
and that's really what it's all about.

36:21.596 --> 36:24.473
Gay Republicans.
What do they know that we don't know?

36:26.142 --> 36:27.226
I mean...

36:29.520 --> 36:33.065
is there something online I can read
to get caught up?

36:33.149 --> 36:36.944
It's like l'm trying to support you,
but are you even trying to support you?

36:39.071 --> 36:42.450
"Yes, I realize I affiliate myself
with a political party

36:42.533 --> 36:46.829
who doesn't believe that I deserve
to breathe the same air as other people.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.373
And a lot of 'em,
if they knew they could get away with it,

36:49.457 --> 36:51.751
would probably try and kill me.

36:51.834 --> 36:53.461
But you want to know something?

36:53.544 --> 36:56.756
At my core, l'm fiscally conservative."

37:00.176 --> 37:04.513
You ever been in your backyard at night,
and you just look up at that endless sky

37:04.597 --> 37:06.307
and you just wonder what it's all about?

37:06.390 --> 37:09.477
Here we are, on a rock,
floating through space.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.270
Whatever this even is.

37:11.354 --> 37:14.482
We don't even know how we got here.
We don't know where we're going.

37:14.565 --> 37:19.111
We don't even currently know
what this is that we exist in.

37:19.195 --> 37:22.573
You see those stars up there,
and they're not even there.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.243
It's just we're finally seeing
the light from those stars.

37:25.326 --> 37:28.037
And just something like that
is so mind-blowing,

37:28.120 --> 37:30.206
you just want to yell out
to the heavens...

37:31.499 --> 37:33.626
"Are we spending too much?"

37:37.088 --> 37:40.508
You guys know.
The bigger questions in life.

37:45.763 --> 37:48.349
We'II be right back after these messages.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.731
Jack White, you're a revolutionary artist.

37:55.815 --> 37:59.485
You're known for doing a lot of firsts
in lots of different fields.

37:59.568 --> 38:01.862
Rory, you've never done stand-up before.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.824
I have never, ever done stand-up.

38:04.907 --> 38:06.867
Rory, let me handle this.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.452
Jack's got it.

38:09.036 --> 38:12.665
Rory has never, ever done stand-up
in his life.

38:12.748 --> 38:16.294
Throughout the years, every single time
l've watched a stand-up comedian

38:16.377 --> 38:18.713
or late-night show appearance

38:18.796 --> 38:22.300
of people who've rehearsed their material,
written it, done the research,

38:22.383 --> 38:24.302
done the roadwork, paid their dues.

38:24.385 --> 38:26.178
- Professionalism.
- We've seen that.

38:26.887 --> 38:29.307
What about a guy
who doesn't know what he's doing,

38:29.390 --> 38:32.727
is completely out of his element,
unattractive,

38:32.810 --> 38:34.520
probably not that funny...

38:34.603 --> 38:36.188
What would that be like?

38:36.272 --> 38:39.734
Rory, why would you put this interview
right in the middle of your special?

38:39.817 --> 38:44.363
Well, Ben, as a complete amateur,
first-timer stand-up,

38:44.447 --> 38:47.199
I actually don't have a lot of material.

38:47.867 --> 38:48.868
Enough, actually.

38:48.951 --> 38:51.787
So I thought, we'II do a sketch
and put it in the middle.

38:51.871 --> 38:53.205
That'II fill some time.

38:53.289 --> 38:58.127
Jack came out.
So that's kind of a cool thing, I think.

39:00.379 --> 39:03.215
Plus...

39:03.299 --> 39:05.468
Pl...

39:05.968 --> 39:07.053
Plus...

39:12.475 --> 39:14.185
Um...

39:14.268 --> 39:16.145
No, wait.
That was actually my final thought.

39:16.228 --> 39:19.148
Thrilled. Excited.

39:19.857 --> 39:20.983
Ecstatic!

39:21.067 --> 39:23.069
Okay.
Could you move over just a little bit?

39:23.152 --> 39:25.071
Yeah, yeah. Just slide over?

39:25.154 --> 39:27.865
- Getting too close. Is that an adequate...
- Sure.

39:27.948 --> 39:30.409
But the thing is,
when you're that excited,

39:30.493 --> 39:32.495
when you're that into it...

39:32.578 --> 39:34.580
Actually, I would move you over even more.

39:34.663 --> 39:35.498
Come over here?

39:35.581 --> 39:38.459
So you wonder, where are the ideas gonna
come from if I have this much energy,

39:38.542 --> 39:39.919
if l'm this excited?

39:40.002 --> 39:41.629
Since l'm brand-new to the whole process...

39:41.712 --> 39:44.757
Can you stop for a second?
Is there another couch we can bring in?

39:44.840 --> 39:48.386
It's new territory,
something I hadn't done before.

39:48.469 --> 39:51.847
And so just, I was... one word, ecstatic.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.352
What is this stuff?

39:56.435 --> 39:58.646
It's small-batch Kentucky.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.940
I bring it in for all of our guests.

40:01.023 --> 40:02.983
It's a nice, special way to wind up.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.027
- Really kind of you. Thank you.
- Cheers.

40:05.111 --> 40:07.071
- Yeah, cheers.
- Glad I can share it with you.

40:07.154 --> 40:08.781
Smells really great from even this far.

40:12.451 --> 40:13.953
Ooh.

40:14.036 --> 40:17.873
Might be fun, maybe you could do
a few jokes now for everybody.

40:17.957 --> 40:20.459
- I... What?
- You should do it.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.211
Okay, yeah. Just right here in the studio?

40:22.294 --> 40:24.088
Yeah, just right here for the audience.

40:24.171 --> 40:26.715
What's best? Kind of be here on the couch?

40:26.799 --> 40:28.926
I would stand up.
It's called stand-up comedy.

40:29.009 --> 40:30.511
Yeah, okay.

40:30.594 --> 40:32.096
- How 'bout...?
- That's right.

40:32.179 --> 40:33.806
- Is this...?
- How 'bout over here maybe?

40:33.889 --> 40:35.391
Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah.

40:38.227 --> 40:39.812
- A little bit...
- Flying is, obviously...

40:39.895 --> 40:42.898
No, a little bit farther for a second.
I don't mean to cut you off.

40:42.982 --> 40:45.484
When you get to the airport...

40:46.068 --> 40:48.362
- I would go even farther.
- Okay.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.281
You're getting a lot of shadows.

40:50.364 --> 40:53.075
- You get there, and TSA, they're like...
- No, no. Couple more.

40:53.159 --> 40:54.660
Couple more feet. A little more.

40:54.743 --> 40:56.245
Further out. Okay.

40:56.328 --> 40:58.497
And then you're already nervous to fly.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.791
And another foot.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.626
- Couple bits.
- And there we are.

41:03.294 --> 41:07.173
When is TSA finally gonna realize
that we all know the shoe thing?

41:07.256 --> 41:08.257
You know what I mean?

41:08.340 --> 41:10.426
You get to the airport,
they tell you to take your shoes off.

41:10.509 --> 41:12.845
It's like, "Who doesn't know by now?"

41:12.928 --> 41:15.639
Is someone getting to the airport,
like, "What?

41:17.183 --> 41:19.310
I have to take my shoes off?"

41:19.727 --> 41:22.730
If that happens,
arrest and kill that person.

41:23.647 --> 41:26.484
They're probably not terrorists,
but they're holding up the line.

41:26.567 --> 41:29.570
And what is terrorism on a local level?

41:29.653 --> 41:32.072
On a local level, what is terrorism?

41:32.656 --> 41:35.201
Holding up the line?
We don't need those people.

41:36.702 --> 41:39.079
"When did this start?" "Kill him!"

41:39.622 --> 41:42.082
And l'm way too far back. "Kill him!

41:42.166 --> 41:44.752
In front of everybody! Everybody watches!

41:44.835 --> 41:47.129
Everyone. No, sweetie, everyone watches.

41:47.213 --> 41:50.341
Everyone. Everyone watches.

41:54.887 --> 41:56.722
Everyone watches.

41:56.805 --> 41:58.140
Never become that."

42:00.601 --> 42:02.853
It's a fuckin' high-pressure situation

42:02.937 --> 42:05.648
the moment you start dealing
with security.

42:05.731 --> 42:08.484
No one gets dressed and undressed
while moving sideways at home,

42:08.567 --> 42:11.570
but goddamn it if you're not
an Olympian when you get there.

42:12.404 --> 42:14.365
Hurry up!

42:14.448 --> 42:17.618
People in tears, like,
"I just want to see my family again!

42:21.080 --> 42:23.624
Am I allowed to leave my pullover on?

42:25.543 --> 42:28.212
Oh, my God!
I forgot to put my wallet in a bin!

42:28.295 --> 42:29.797
What'II happen?"

42:36.554 --> 42:37.972
No wallets!

42:42.434 --> 42:44.937
It's so fuckin' tense.

42:45.604 --> 42:48.440
Like when you're in line with everybody
and you're going through the zigzags,

42:48.524 --> 42:50.901
yeah, you're having the time of your life.

42:53.153 --> 42:55.656
The moment you touch a bin,
you're in the Octagon.

42:55.739 --> 42:58.909
Nobody's your buddy. Nobody's your pal.

43:00.119 --> 43:02.454
They're timing you.
As soon as you touch a bin, go!

43:04.498 --> 43:06.709
"That's as fast as you can go?

43:06.792 --> 43:08.586
How many bins do you need?

43:09.211 --> 43:11.880
Laptop and an iPad?
Where the fuck are you going?"

43:16.010 --> 43:18.679
Then you gotta go through
that goddamn Stargate machine.

43:19.430 --> 43:21.223
What is that?

43:21.307 --> 43:24.184
Why do we just do it? What is it?

43:25.436 --> 43:27.354
If you asked TSA,
"What does this even do?"

43:27.438 --> 43:30.524
They're like, "Well, shows us where
your sweaty spots are,

43:30.608 --> 43:31.900
and then we tackle 'em."

43:35.321 --> 43:37.865
Next time you're at the airport
and you step into that Stargate machine,

43:37.948 --> 43:39.825
look at the person on the other side
and be like,

43:39.908 --> 43:42.494
"I guess Los Angeles, 1984, please."

43:53.422 --> 43:54.673
"Sir, please come out."

43:54.757 --> 43:57.301
"Oh. How long was I gone?"

43:57.384 --> 44:00.054
Do all that. "Sir, you can step out."

44:00.137 --> 44:02.431
"How long was I gone?

44:02.514 --> 44:03.807
Where am I?"

44:03.891 --> 44:06.018
"Very funny, sir.
Please go, get on your flight.

44:06.101 --> 44:09.605
You, ma'am, with the baby formula,
why are you here?"

44:12.024 --> 44:14.276
"I think I was sent from the future
to kill a boy."

44:14.360 --> 44:16.528
"Sir, please, grab your bag.
Go get on your flight.

44:16.612 --> 44:18.906
Ma'am, get over here!

44:18.989 --> 44:21.075
Why are you trying to feed infants?"

44:29.625 --> 44:31.835
Anyways, that's my airport jaunt.

44:36.048 --> 44:40.344
If you think Jesus was white, you're not
allowed to have an opinion on gun control.

44:43.430 --> 44:45.641
Not everyone's gonna agree.

44:46.767 --> 44:49.770
We know now, more than ever,
education's expensive.

44:51.105 --> 44:53.857
Also some people in the crowd are like,
"But Jesus was white."

44:53.941 --> 44:55.943
And you're doing the best.

44:57.069 --> 44:59.196
I want to live like that.

44:59.279 --> 45:00.656
I can't.

45:00.739 --> 45:03.700
I gotta be up here. I gotta look into it.

45:05.786 --> 45:08.372
All l'm saying is,
if you guys want real change,

45:08.455 --> 45:11.708
you gotta limit
some people's ability to vote.

45:11.792 --> 45:12.751
I know.

45:12.835 --> 45:15.712
I know. I know.

45:15.796 --> 45:17.756
It doesn't sound progressive.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.633
Neither does genocide.

45:20.217 --> 45:23.303
People hate genocide.

45:24.012 --> 45:25.139
Why?

45:28.142 --> 45:30.227
Because it's been used horrifically

45:30.310 --> 45:34.440
every single time it's been used
throughout history?

45:35.274 --> 45:37.568
That doesn't necessarily
make it a bad thing.

45:39.236 --> 45:41.196
If I told you guys tomorrow

45:41.280 --> 45:45.534
that we were gonna round up
all of the racist, homophobic people

45:45.617 --> 45:46.910
and kill them,

45:46.994 --> 45:49.121
you're telling me
all the smart people wouldn't be like...

45:49.997 --> 45:52.374
"Well, shit,
we haven't tried that version.

45:54.835 --> 45:56.587
That might actually have an impact."

45:56.670 --> 45:59.006
Maybe it's not based
on skin color or religion.

45:59.089 --> 46:02.801
Maybe it's just, "Who's the dick?
Get him out. Get him out of here."

46:03.594 --> 46:06.346
Lump in global warming deniers.
Let's clean house.

46:06.430 --> 46:09.683
You guys get it. You guys are hip.
You're cool. You get it.

46:10.684 --> 46:13.353
l'm one of those people
that doesn't believe in global warming,

46:13.437 --> 46:16.148
but l'm pretty sure Noah's ark
was a true story.

46:19.109 --> 46:23.572
Where the guy was warning everybody
about the insane change in the weather,

46:23.655 --> 46:26.325
and everyone's like,
"Shut the fuck up, Noah.

46:27.326 --> 46:31.955
Quit hoggin' all the wood
so you can go off and fuck those animals.

46:32.039 --> 46:34.166
Well, that's what it looks like.

46:34.249 --> 46:36.668
That's what it looks like to us, dude.

46:36.752 --> 46:40.297
Looks like you're building
some kind of sex ship out there.

46:41.006 --> 46:43.967
If that's not the case,
you need to come down to the pub,

46:44.051 --> 46:47.304
and you need to give a speech,
'cause people are talking, dude.

46:47.387 --> 46:49.723
People are fuckin' talkin'.
We don't know you.

46:49.806 --> 46:52.476
We don't know you.
People are chattin', dude.

46:53.143 --> 46:54.770
You're like a thousand.

46:56.063 --> 46:58.023
No one else is a thousand."

47:08.742 --> 47:12.412
On the topic of guns,
not everyone here likes guns.

47:12.496 --> 47:14.540
Not everyone here hates guns.

47:14.623 --> 47:16.375
Maybe some guns shouldn't be available.

47:16.458 --> 47:20.879
But what we do know for a fact
is that right now,

47:20.963 --> 47:24.341
all of the guns are currently available.

47:24.424 --> 47:27.386
And some people are collecting guns.

47:27.469 --> 47:32.474
And some people are picking flowers,
hoping it all goes away one day.

47:32.933 --> 47:36.436
I assure you, it is not going to go away.

47:36.520 --> 47:40.649
You've been led to believe at some point,
it's gonna be us versus them.

47:40.732 --> 47:42.568
We just don't know who "them" is.

47:42.651 --> 47:45.571
But in reality,
it's gonna be red versus blue,

47:45.654 --> 47:48.156
and it's gonna be a fuckin' bloodbath.

47:48.240 --> 47:52.035
So while guns are currently available...

47:52.995 --> 47:55.789
consider having a few around.

47:55.872 --> 47:58.584
You know, for when the shit hits the fan.

47:59.167 --> 48:01.169
You don't want people barging in
in your house

48:01.253 --> 48:03.589
and you're like,
"I got a ton of steak knives!"

48:06.592 --> 48:08.844
I told my wife,
"I think we should get a gun."

48:08.927 --> 48:10.554
She was like, "Why do we need a gun?"

48:10.637 --> 48:13.974
I was like, "I don't know. We're probably
gonna want water in ten years."

48:15.851 --> 48:18.395
I want to live for today
like everybody else,

48:18.478 --> 48:20.272
but I gotta live for tomorrow
a little bit.

48:20.355 --> 48:22.357
You know what I mean? Look down the road.

48:23.108 --> 48:25.277
Look down the Fury Road, you guys.

48:26.820 --> 48:28.822
Did anybody see that documentary?

48:29.406 --> 48:32.576
Anybody see that?
"I thought it was a film." Did you?

48:34.494 --> 48:37.539
"O.J. hated water. He hated water."

48:38.999 --> 48:41.376
We'd go out, and l'd be like, "O.J.

48:41.960 --> 48:43.837
Need some water."

48:47.382 --> 48:50.010
I will say this. I don't do impressions
'cause l'm shitty at 'em.

48:50.093 --> 48:52.304
But I promise you,
this one is pretty close.

48:53.305 --> 48:56.600
It's pretty close. When you finally watch
that documentary, you're, "Oh, my God.

48:58.060 --> 49:01.730
It's a shame that guy killed himself.
He could have made money doing voices."

49:04.733 --> 49:07.069
You know what?

49:07.152 --> 49:08.236
O.J.

49:11.323 --> 49:13.659
I don't like how some people react
when glass breaks.

49:13.742 --> 49:15.452
Have you seen these people?

49:17.287 --> 49:20.540
What if this was my whole show?
"Have you guys seen these people?"

49:22.834 --> 49:25.962
Glass breaks, they're like,
"Nobody touch it!"

49:27.047 --> 49:29.341
Shut the fuck up.

49:29.424 --> 49:33.053
This is nobody's first broken glass rodeo.

49:34.846 --> 49:38.517
Nobody's running over like,
"Here, let me scoop up a lot of the shards

49:38.600 --> 49:40.727
with my bare forearms.

49:40.811 --> 49:45.607
Put all the pieces in my mouth
till I find a trash can at some point.

49:45.691 --> 49:48.694
No, put the shards of glass
into my mouth."

49:50.946 --> 49:53.115
"Nobody walk around with your shoes off."

49:53.198 --> 49:54.991
Are you sure?

49:57.160 --> 50:01.248
When I heard the glass break,
I immediately threw on my bathing suit.

50:01.832 --> 50:03.458
Was that for nothing?

50:04.418 --> 50:06.920
Where's the glass? Yay!

50:12.134 --> 50:15.929
Get these "save the dates"
for people's weddings.

50:16.012 --> 50:18.306
You guys know what l'm talking about.
The "save the dates."

50:18.390 --> 50:20.225
When did this start? Why did this start?

50:20.308 --> 50:23.311
Why was someone like, "You know what?
In advance of the invitation,

50:23.395 --> 50:25.772
let's send our friends a "save the date,'

50:25.856 --> 50:28.817
as to say, "Psst! Heads up.

50:29.985 --> 50:31.820
Invitation on the way.

50:32.612 --> 50:35.031
You're one of the chosen ones.

50:35.115 --> 50:38.034
That's right. Identical information
on both pieces of paper.

50:39.536 --> 50:40.829
Except on that save the date,

50:40.912 --> 50:44.499
you're gonna get a pretty cool,
insecure picture of the two of us.

50:44.583 --> 50:46.960
That's a magnet. Put that on the fridge.

50:48.295 --> 50:50.839
Decorate your home with our faces.'"

50:53.049 --> 50:55.886
You see those pictures,
you're like, "Oh, fuck.

50:56.511 --> 50:58.722
I can't go to this."

50:58.805 --> 51:02.017
They're just looking at you like,
"This is what love is, right?

51:03.769 --> 51:07.856
We're in a field in the middle of nowhere,
standing next to an abandoned barn.

51:08.440 --> 51:10.066
Come to our wedding.

51:11.067 --> 51:13.528
Look at us.
We're spooning backwards while standing,

51:13.612 --> 51:16.239
laughing about something
one of us brought up.

51:17.949 --> 51:19.576
Be at our wedding!

51:20.619 --> 51:22.454
Look, we're on a dock
in the middle of a lake.

51:22.537 --> 51:25.040
We don't even live near a lake.
How did we get there?

51:25.123 --> 51:26.249
Love!

51:26.333 --> 51:30.420
Love drove us that day
to get those candid photographs.

51:31.546 --> 51:33.381
We didn't even know
the photographer was there.

51:33.465 --> 51:35.801
We're just always standing like that."

51:38.512 --> 51:40.972
Also, those pictures,
that's never the dude's idea.

51:41.056 --> 51:43.642
When you get that "save the date,"
and it's like your buddy, you're like,

51:43.725 --> 51:45.769
what the fuck is this?

51:46.478 --> 51:48.230
The dude is never, "You know what?

51:48.313 --> 51:51.817
Let's take one where our foreheads
are touching and our eyes are closed.

51:51.900 --> 51:53.944
You know, as like a backup.

51:54.027 --> 51:57.572
As a backup, in case we don't use the one
where l'm shirtless on a horse.

51:59.157 --> 52:00.367
You know."

52:01.827 --> 52:04.621
If you want to invite me to your wedding,
just send me a piece of paper.

52:04.704 --> 52:06.373
Loose-leaf is perfect.

52:07.374 --> 52:10.544
Scribble it with crayon. Save the money.

52:11.545 --> 52:13.839
Just send me a piece of paper
that's got the date of the wedding

52:13.922 --> 52:16.883
and tell me if you're gonna have alcohol
at the reception or not.

52:16.967 --> 52:19.678
Because if you're not gonna serve alcohol

52:19.761 --> 52:21.763
at your wedding reception,

52:21.847 --> 52:25.100
show some balls
and put that on the invitation.

52:26.226 --> 52:29.896
Find out the hard way
how many of your friends and family...

52:30.689 --> 52:33.149
truly give a fuck about your wedding.

52:49.916 --> 52:51.918
You get to a reception...
"Yeah, l'II take a beer."

52:52.002 --> 52:53.837
"Oh, we don't have any alcohol."

52:54.880 --> 52:56.882
"Then what the fuck
did I just sit through?

52:58.383 --> 53:00.093
A shitty play?"

53:01.636 --> 53:03.388
That's what a wedding is.

53:03.471 --> 53:05.765
A wedding is a shitty play.

53:05.849 --> 53:08.768
The only people who like it are in it,
like all plays.

53:13.189 --> 53:15.400
Everybody else is in the audience like,

53:15.483 --> 53:19.070
"Twenty more minutes,
we are getting fucked!"

53:19.821 --> 53:21.531
"Not at our wedding!

53:21.615 --> 53:23.491
We invited Jesus."

53:28.246 --> 53:30.624
I was at a wedding.
It was a non-alcoholic reception.

53:30.707 --> 53:33.209
I was like, "I hope they get diarrhea
on the honeymoon."

53:33.960 --> 53:36.254
That's not a very nice thing to say.
I was like, "Really?

53:36.338 --> 53:38.715
I was gonna say I hope they die tonight."

53:42.594 --> 53:47.057
Nothing gets me on the dance floor
like a big old pint of sweet tea!

53:50.185 --> 53:53.939
I like to be fully present in the moment,
fully aware l'm not a good dancer.

53:54.022 --> 53:56.775
The sweet tea reminds me
every step of the way.

54:06.618 --> 54:08.620
l've used a Fleshlight before.

54:12.666 --> 54:14.376
Guys, don't be like that.

54:15.502 --> 54:16.836
Don't be like that.

54:18.338 --> 54:20.674
I was at a show,
doing a festival in Texas.

54:20.757 --> 54:22.926
They gave all the performers a gift bag.

54:23.593 --> 54:25.470
In the gift bag
there was a free Fleshlight.

54:25.553 --> 54:27.263
I don't know
if they gave us those as a joke.

54:27.347 --> 54:29.391
I didn't take it as one.

54:31.142 --> 54:33.269
I pulled myself aside...

54:33.979 --> 54:37.816
and immediately reprioritized
my entire afternoon.

54:39.567 --> 54:42.237
I said, "Rory, we skipped lunch before.
Didn't kill us then.

54:42.320 --> 54:44.572
Will not kill us now."

54:44.656 --> 54:47.283
"Fuck this thing!"
Out loud in a hotel lobby.

54:47.367 --> 54:49.452
"I gotta get my dick out!

54:50.745 --> 54:52.455
I gotta do it!"

54:53.873 --> 54:58.294
Some women in this crowd, you're like,
"I think it's gross he used a Fleshlight."

54:58.378 --> 55:01.923
Some women don't care. Some women
still think I said "flashlight."

55:03.925 --> 55:05.885
Now you know who you are.

55:05.969 --> 55:07.971
So do the people around you.

55:08.722 --> 55:11.182
"Well, then what is it?"
"I don't fucking know.

55:11.266 --> 55:13.852
Dude fucking loves 9/11. I don't know.

55:14.602 --> 55:15.854
I don't know."

55:18.440 --> 55:22.360
If you're a dude in here, and you think
it's gross that l've used a Fleshlight,

55:22.444 --> 55:24.154
you need to look at the facts.

55:24.237 --> 55:27.157
You're in a city that you do not live in,

55:27.240 --> 55:29.951
in a hotel room by yourself.

55:30.368 --> 55:34.372
Someone gives you a free Fleshlight.

55:35.165 --> 55:37.417
You can go fuck yourself

55:37.500 --> 55:39.711
if you think
you're not gonna go fuck yourself.

55:41.796 --> 55:44.674
You're immediately going
to go fuck yourself

55:44.758 --> 55:46.509
because you have to know.

55:46.593 --> 55:48.928
What is it like?

55:49.012 --> 55:52.348
I know some people are in here,
"Oh, I don't need a sex toy."

55:52.432 --> 55:54.017
Grow up.

55:54.934 --> 55:58.354
If you were out on the sidewalk right now
and someone pulled up in a Ferrari

55:58.438 --> 56:02.192
and was like, "Get in," you're not gonna
be like, "But I already have a car."

56:03.359 --> 56:05.820
No. You're gonna get in.

56:05.904 --> 56:09.574
And you're gonna find out the hard way
it's a Kia Rio in disguise.

56:15.163 --> 56:17.791
Here's how they work.

56:17.874 --> 56:19.876
Whoo, this joke is a two-parter.

56:21.127 --> 56:25.048
You have to take a fake, rubbery vagina...

56:25.799 --> 56:28.802
out of a flashlight casing

56:28.885 --> 56:31.221
and put it in warm water

56:31.304 --> 56:33.014
for five minutes.

56:34.641 --> 56:38.353
Never in your entire life

56:38.561 --> 56:40.480
will you feel more ridiculous.

56:42.482 --> 56:45.819
Standing in a hotel bathroom...

56:46.986 --> 56:48.655
naked, 'cause you're ready.

56:48.738 --> 56:52.033
You're ready. You don't know.
You don't know what's about to happen.

56:52.117 --> 56:54.119
Be ready. Be naked. Be ready.

56:55.745 --> 56:58.039
Standing over the sink

56:58.123 --> 57:02.210
like a kid who just dropped one of those
dinosaur sponge pills into the water.

57:03.419 --> 57:06.131
Can't wait for my vagina to be ready!

57:07.507 --> 57:10.718
I love going on the road!
Brings out the best in me!

57:14.514 --> 57:16.933
When you're doing that
in a hotel bathroom,

57:17.016 --> 57:18.810
there is one other person
in there with you,

57:18.893 --> 57:21.688
and you lock eyes
the moment you look in the mirror.

57:22.939 --> 57:25.191
And he's got questions.

57:25.275 --> 57:27.277
Rory, how did we get here?

57:28.403 --> 57:30.488
How did we get to this point?

57:31.239 --> 57:32.615
You're married.

57:32.699 --> 57:36.327
Surely your wife knows someone
you can sleep with.

57:39.581 --> 57:41.916
Not a lot of people
ever laugh at that part.

57:43.418 --> 57:45.503
She certainly wishes
I would stop saying it.

57:48.756 --> 57:50.758
But now we got these cameras.

57:51.634 --> 57:53.178
Can't go back now.

57:53.678 --> 57:55.972
It's out there.

57:57.223 --> 58:00.685
I think what life is actually about...

58:02.395 --> 58:06.191
Now actually... And action.
Now the special is starting. Action.

58:09.110 --> 58:11.654
I think what life is actually about...

58:12.238 --> 58:15.325
is realizing
that we're all covered in layers

58:15.408 --> 58:17.535
that we've put there for some reason.

58:17.619 --> 58:19.621
For protection. Whatever reason it is.

58:19.704 --> 58:22.290
The only way you're gonna get to know
who you truly are

58:22.373 --> 58:25.752
and expose your true self to everyone else

58:25.835 --> 58:27.879
is to get rid of those layers.

58:27.962 --> 58:30.840
And you see some people
get rid of those layers at a young age.

58:30.924 --> 58:32.634
You see they have a very happy life.

58:32.717 --> 58:36.304
Then you see some people that are your age
who haven't removed one layer.

58:36.387 --> 58:38.556
You're like, "Ooh."

58:39.557 --> 58:43.186
That's the layer that I removed that day.

58:45.939 --> 58:47.565
I found out...

58:48.149 --> 58:50.068
that l'm a guy

58:50.151 --> 58:52.153
who will just fuck whatever you got.

58:58.159 --> 59:01.162
What have you got over there,
a pile of inanimate objects?

59:09.837 --> 59:11.839
Cool if I put my dick in 'em?

59:13.633 --> 59:15.969
l'm one of those people.

59:17.303 --> 59:19.556
l'd fuck a fake ass, if you had one.

59:20.598 --> 59:22.225
Don't act like
you don't know what that is.

59:22.308 --> 59:25.228
Nobody can clear their pop-ups that fast.

59:25.728 --> 59:28.856
Not saying you have one,
but you know what's on the market.

59:28.940 --> 59:32.443
No legs, no torso.
It's just an ass that you have sex with.

59:32.527 --> 59:35.405
Yes, the show is surprisingly bookended.

59:52.297 --> 59:56.926
I hope that's the point that the guy was
taking an hour-long shit comes back in.

01:00:01.222 --> 01:00:04.392
"Why are you still watching this?"
"You missed a lot of other stuff.

01:00:06.477 --> 01:00:08.104
He hates women."

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:20.033
I looked at one of those fake asses
for about five...

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:22.535
Shut up, guys. Not now.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.954
Not this close to the end.
Don't you leave me.

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:28.249
Lock those doors. They are locked?
So all the doors are locked.

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:33.880
I looked at one of those things
for five minutes.

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:37.383
I was like, "You know what?
If no one was ever gonna know,

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.260
then, yeah, l'II have sex with it.

01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:41.888
l'm gonna jerk off anyway."
Fellas, am I right?

01:00:54.942 --> 01:00:57.153
The shittiest choreographed ending.

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:07.080
All right. Just me. Just me.

01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:09.749
I thought we'd all stand up
and get into it, but...

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.002
Women, I don't know
if you know this about men...

01:01:14.295 --> 01:01:17.298
but when we're in our 20s
and our brain is, "Jerk off right now,"

01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:20.385
we're like, "You got it. You got it."

01:01:22.428 --> 01:01:25.431
When we're in our 30s
and our brain is, "Jerk off right now,"

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.642
I promise you, all of us are like,

01:01:27.725 --> 01:01:30.645
"When the fuck does this stop?

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:35.858
I don't wanna do this shit anymore.

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:38.569
It's been 20 goddamn years.

01:01:39.237 --> 01:01:40.780
I haven't liked it for ten.

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:43.658
I just kept doing it
'cause I thought l'd die.

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:46.494
Stay away from me...

01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:49.622
and stay away from my family."

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:56.087
My question is,
if you buy one of those fake asses...

01:01:56.671 --> 01:01:58.673
where do you even keep that?

01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:02.427
"I keep mine under the bed."

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:04.345
Do you, you lunatic?

01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:09.517
I would rather my child find
a loaded gun in the house.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:15.314
Far less awkward than the day
my kid comes into the kitchen,

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:17.483
"Daddy, what's this?"

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:20.570
Well, that's kind of your mom
when she's out of town.

01:02:21.612 --> 01:02:24.198
You guys, thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:27.452
Thank you. Thank you, guys.

01:02:27.535 --> 01:02:29.370
Thank you so much.

01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:57.523
Rory! Rory! Rory!

01:02:57.607 --> 01:03:00.610
Rory! Rory! Ror...

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:05.948
Oh, this is fantas... Guys!
This is the best.

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:08.075
You guys do this at the end of every show?

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:10.203
- Get him in there.
- You guys are the absolute best.

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:12.205
No, don't throw me in a Dumpster!

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:14.582
- That sucked.
- Hey!

01:03:14.665 --> 01:03:16.751
- He was better than Todd Glass.
- Who?

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:34.685
âŞ Broken bodies line the dance floor
Piling on top of me âŞ

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:40.817
âŞ l've tried my luck, now what the fuck
To do with the misery? âŞ

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:44.070
âŞ Witness all the mess I will regret âŞ

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:47.490
âŞ By this time next morning âŞ

01:03:47.573 --> 01:03:53.287

âŞ Lights on everywhere âŞ

âŞ Oh-oh âŞ

01:04:06.467 --> 01:04:10.847
âŞ Oh, so far across the sea âŞ

01:04:11.556 --> 01:04:16.686
âŞ Broken bodies line the dance floor

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:03.774
âŞ Home, go home âŞ

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:11.449
âŞ Go home âŞ

01:05:11.532 --> 01:05:16.704
âŞ Broken bodies line the dance floor
Piling on top of me âŞ

01:05:17.204 --> 01:05:22.835
âŞ I tried my luck, now what the fuck
To do with the misery? âŞ

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:26.130
âŞ Witness all the mess I will regret âŞ

01:05:26.213 --> 01:05:29.467
âŞ By this time next morning âŞ

01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:34.722
âŞ Broken bodies line the dance floor
Piling on top of me âŞ

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:42.355
âŞ Broken bodies line the dance floor
Piling on top of me âŞ

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:11.217
Oh. Um...
