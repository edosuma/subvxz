09:11.875 --> 09:14.709
- YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE SOMEONE
WHO NEEDS HELP.

09:14.709 --> 09:16.667
- EVEN A MAN
DANGLING FROM A CLIFF

09:16.667 --> 09:18.792

I'M NOT.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.875
MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL WANT ISAAK
FOR MYSELF?

10:17.875 --> 10:20.291

11:08.333 --> 11:10.667
HOLY FIL-A-FUCK.

11:10.667 --> 11:12.417
WHO ARE YOU?

11:26.208 --> 11:28.500
- HARAKIRI.

11:28.500 --> 11:31.125
SELF-IMMOLATION.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.125
WHAT IS IT WITH MY PEOPLE?

11:32.125 --> 11:33.667
FIRST IN MATH,
FIRST TO CHECK OUT.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.917
- IT'S ACTUALLY
SELF-INCINERATION.

11:35.917 --> 11:37.125
IMMOLATION IS A FORM
OF SACRIFICE

11:37.125 --> 11:40.500
BY ANY MEANS,
ISN'T RESTRICTED TO FIRE.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.542
- WELL,
EXCUSE THE FUCK OUT OF ME.

11:42.542 --> 11:45.041

IT'S A SUICIDE?

WHEN EVERY GODDAMN SECOND
OF EVERY GODDAMN DAY

12:19.542 --> 12:20.959
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS TAKE IT BACK?

12:20.959 --> 12:23.458

I'VE ALWAYS FELT THE SAME WAY.

TO DO THIS.

12:24.709 --> 12:25.542

12:29.583 --> 12:31.000
- DEX--

12:31.000 --> 12:33.500
- AND IT'S OKAY.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.417
I UNDERSTAND,
IT MAKES SENSE.

12:35.417 --> 12:39.250
IT'S LOGICAL.

12:39.250 --> 12:42.000
LIKE...

12:42.000 --> 12:44.500
THE WAY I LOVE M&Ms,
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW I SHOULDN'T--

12:44.500 --> 12:45.834
- M&-FUCKING-Ms?

12:45.834 --> 12:47.875
- I'M TRYING HERE--
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

12:47.875 --> 12:50.083
- WHY, DEXTER?
IT'S SURE AS SHIT NOT LOGICAL.

12:50.083 --> 12:52.417
- UNLESS YOU CONSIDER
EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

12:52.417 --> 12:53.834
YOU ARE THE ONE PERSON
ON THE PLANET

12:53.834 --> 12:55.583
WHO'S BEEN
DOWN THE SAME ROAD AS ME.

12:55.583 --> 12:59.417
- SAME ROAD,
VERY DIFFERENT CARS.

12:59.417 --> 13:02.792
- DEB, WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN
THE ONE CONSTANT THING

13:02.792 --> 13:04.667
IN EACH OTHER'S LIVES.

13:04.667 --> 13:07.917
IT'S LIKE, YOU AND I,
WE ENDURE.

13:10.458 --> 13:12.250
MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT LOVE IS,

13:12.250 --> 13:15.000
ENDURANCE.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.792
SO...

13:16.792 --> 13:18.125
OF COURSE YOU THINK
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH ME.

13:18.125 --> 13:19.542
- [groans]
PLEASE, STOP SAYING THAT.

13:19.542 --> 13:21.083
- IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.166
- NO.

13:22.166 --> 13:23.959
IT'S--

13:23.959 --> 13:28.792
- LOGICAL.
BECAUSE IT IS.

13:28.792 --> 13:30.000
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.875
- FUCK.
THAT, COMING FROM YOU--

13:32.875 --> 13:37.291
- SHOULD MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.

13:37.291 --> 13:40.291
- IT DOES.

13:40.291 --> 13:41.709
GOD, DEXTER.

13:41.709 --> 13:45.917
YOU, ME, DAD--

13:45.917 --> 13:49.709
IT'S LIKE MOM GOT CANCER
TO TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT.

13:49.709 --> 13:51.291
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE IT'S BETTER

13:51.291 --> 13:55.333
THAT IT'S OUT THERE, AND IT'S
NOT CONTROLLING ME ANYMORE.

13:55.333 --> 13:58.500
[cell phone beeps]

14:02.083 --> 14:05.417
- DO YOU FEEL THAT WAY
ABOUT YOUR SECRET?

14:05.417 --> 14:08.375
- NOT REALLY.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.166
DEB?

14:21.208 --> 14:23.959
HANNAH?

14:23.959 --> 14:25.166
I SAW YOUR VAN OUTSIDE,
ARE YOU...

14:25.166 --> 14:28.041
[tea kettle whistling]

14:28.041 --> 14:29.000
HERE?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.041
- DEXTER.

14:30.041 --> 14:31.333
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME
FOR TEA.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.166
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,
I LET MYSELF IN.

14:33.166 --> 14:35.166
THAT'S FAR ENOUGH.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.208
I JUST WANT TO TALK.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.583
- WHERE'S HANNAH?

14:40.583 --> 14:44.417
- JURG'S BEEN KEEPING TABS
ON YOU FOR ME--

14:44.417 --> 14:46.709
YOUR COMINGS AND GOINGS,

14:46.709 --> 14:49.041
WHERE YOU SPEND
YOUR NIGHTS.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.709
SEEMS THIS HANNAH'S
QUITE IMPORTANT TO YOU.

14:50.709 --> 14:52.208
- WHERE IS SHE?

14:52.208 --> 14:55.083
- I ASSURE YOU SHE'S PERFECTLY
SAFE AND QUITE COMFORTABLE.

14:55.083 --> 15:00.041
JURG IS SEEING TO THAT.

15:00.041 --> 15:01.875
- LET HER GO.
THIS IS BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

15:01.875 --> 15:04.208
- WELL, NOT QUITE.

15:04.208 --> 15:06.917
THERE IS THE SMALL MATTER
OF THE TWO MEN WHO WANT ME DEAD

15:06.917 --> 15:10.834
AND YOUR STUBBORN REFUSAL
TO HELP.

15:10.834 --> 15:13.709
YOU ASKED ME
WHAT WAS IN THIS FOR YOU.

15:13.709 --> 15:16.333
WELL, IF YOUR LIFE
DOESN'T MATTER,

15:16.333 --> 15:19.208
I'M BETTING HERS DOES.

15:25.834 --> 15:28.709
- WELL, I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO TAKE YOU UP ON THAT TEA.

15:28.709 --> 15:30.208
- SPLENDID IDEA.

15:32.291 --> 15:33.500
- I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.917
I KILL YOU AND LEAVE YOU OUT
FOR THE KOSHKAS TO FIND.

15:35.917 --> 15:38.709
- YES, YOU CAN DO THAT,

15:38.709 --> 15:41.083
BUT THAT LEAVES HANNAH
WITH JURG.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.542
I'M AFRAID
HE'S NOT AS HONORABLE

15:43.542 --> 15:45.417
NOR AS FORGIVING
AS I AM.

15:45.417 --> 15:48.083
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK HANNAH
MEANS ANYTHING TO ME?

15:48.083 --> 15:49.917
- WELL, IF SHE DIDN'T,
I'D BE DEAD BY NOW.

16:04.208 --> 16:05.709
- YOU HAVE
THE WRONG GUY.

16:05.709 --> 16:07.000
THIS ISN'T WHAT I DO.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.291
- [scoffs]
YOU KILLED VIKTOR,

16:10.291 --> 16:11.208
AS WELL AS THE MAN

16:11.208 --> 16:12.625
WAITING FOR ME
IN MY APARTMENT.

16:12.625 --> 16:13.875
HE HAD A GUN,
YOU HAD A KNIFE.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.792
I THINK I HAVE
EXACTLY THE RIGHT MAN.

16:15.792 --> 16:17.458
- AND IF I HELP YOU,
THEN WHAT?

16:17.458 --> 16:19.917
- YOU GET HANNAH BACK,

16:19.917 --> 16:23.083
AND I WALK AWAY FROM MIAMI
AND FROM YOU.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.625
NO MATTER WHAT YOU MAY THINK
OF ME OR MY METHODS,

16:25.625 --> 16:30.417
I AM A MAN
OF MY WORD.

16:30.417 --> 16:33.917
- I NEED TO KNOW
SHE'S ALIVE.

16:36.667 --> 16:40.750
[phone ringing]

16:41.792 --> 16:45.959
[phone beeps]

16:47.667 --> 16:49.250
- HANNAH,
I TRUST YOU

16:49.250 --> 16:51.208
AND JURG ARE SETTLED IN.

16:51.208 --> 16:52.291
- WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

16:52.291 --> 16:55.333
- THE REASON, MY DEAR,
IS RIGHT HERE.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.875
- DEXTER--

16:56.875 --> 16:59.875
- DON'T WORRY.
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

16:59.875 --> 17:01.250
NOW, YOU BEHAVE.
- NO, WAIT!

17:01.250 --> 17:04.709
DEXTER--
[phone beeps]

17:04.709 --> 17:07.333
- YOUR LIFE IS
IN HIS HANDS NOW.

17:07.333 --> 17:09.417
LISTEN TO ME CAREFULLY.

17:09.417 --> 17:12.750
SCREAM, MAKE NOISE,
I HURT YOU.

17:12.750 --> 17:13.834
TRY TO ESCAPE,

17:13.834 --> 17:17.166
I HURT YOU BADLY.

17:17.166 --> 17:21.417
CLEAR?

17:21.417 --> 17:23.542
HERE.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.583
FIND SOMETHING
FOR US TO WATCH.

17:26.583 --> 17:28.542
AND NONE
OF THE AMERICAN REALITY SHIT.

17:37.542 --> 17:39.125
- HERE.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.625
OLEG MICKIC--
EX-MILITARY. EFFICIENT.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.333
METHODICAL,
WHICH IS WHY I'VE EMPLOYED HIM

17:43.333 --> 17:47.083
MORE TIMES
THAN I CAN COUNT.

17:47.083 --> 17:49.709
- AND THAT ONE?
- BENJAMIN CAFFREY.

17:49.709 --> 17:51.125
HE'S A YANK
LIKE YOU,

17:51.125 --> 17:52.417
OUT OF NEW YORK.

17:52.417 --> 17:56.208
LESS RELIABLE
BUT, AS YOU CAN SEE,

17:56.208 --> 17:57.208
JUST AS DEADLY.

17:57.208 --> 18:00.208
- ANY WEAKNESSES?

18:00.208 --> 18:01.375
I NEED TO KNOW
EVERYTHING.

18:01.375 --> 18:03.083
- CAFFREY LIKES IT
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.750
KNIVES, PIANO WIRE.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.917
AND AS YOU SAW,

18:06.917 --> 18:08.875
HE'S A VICIOUS LITTLE CUNT.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.083
WHEREAS MICKIC DOESN'T LIKE
TO GET HIS HANDS DIRTY.

18:11.083 --> 18:12.291
- GUNS?

18:12.291 --> 18:14.750
- HIGH-POWERED RIFLES
SPECIFICALLY.

18:14.750 --> 18:15.959
HE'S A SLAVE
TO RITUAL.

18:15.959 --> 18:18.083
HE'LL BUY
A RIFLE LOCALLY

18:18.083 --> 18:20.417
AND BE COMPELLED
TO TEST IT OUT FIRST.

18:20.417 --> 18:23.083
- THE POINT OF A RIFLE IS TO HIT
A TARGET FROM A LONG DISTANCE.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.208
THE RANGE WOULD NEED
TO BE OUTDOORS.

18:27.917 --> 18:31.041
- THAT'S HIS FAVORITE.

18:34.041 --> 18:36.917
SAVAGE ARMS 110
SNIPER RIFLE.

18:36.917 --> 18:39.625
MOST RANGES DON'T SELL
THE KIND OF MAGAZINE ROUNDS

18:39.625 --> 18:42.917
THIS ONE USES.

18:42.917 --> 18:44.250
THAT'S WHERE I'LL START
TOMORROW.

18:44.250 --> 18:47.250
- WELL, JUST WHERE ARE YOU
RUNNING OFF TO,

18:47.250 --> 18:48.834
ALL HELTER SKELTER?

18:48.834 --> 18:50.291
- I'M HUNGRY.

18:50.291 --> 18:52.375
- YOU'VE BEEN TASKED
WITH HELPING KILL TWO MEN.

18:52.375 --> 18:54.417
A LOVED ONE'S LIFE
HANGS IN THE BALANCE,

18:54.417 --> 18:56.250
AND YOU'RE HUNGRY?

18:56.250 --> 18:58.500
- IT'S LATE.
- LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.333
JUST HOW MANY MEN
HAVE YOU KILLED?

19:04.208 --> 19:05.750
- A LOT.

19:05.750 --> 19:08.750
- I ASKED MICKIC
THE SAME QUESTION ONCE.

19:08.750 --> 19:09.792
HE ANSWERED, "16,"

19:09.792 --> 19:12.083
AND THE BASTARD
WAS ALMOST POUNDING HIS CHEST.

19:12.083 --> 19:14.959
BUT YOU--

19:14.959 --> 19:18.417
YOU DON'T SEEM TO REVEL
IN WHAT YOU DO. WHY?

19:18.417 --> 19:21.542
- YOU TRYING TO HAVE
A MOMENT?

19:21.542 --> 19:24.291
I DON'T BOND.

19:24.291 --> 19:26.875
- MOST MEN
KILL FOR MONEY,

19:26.875 --> 19:29.667
SOME
FOR THE SHEER BRUTALITY,

19:29.667 --> 19:32.792
OTHERS LIKE ME,
REVENGE.

19:32.792 --> 19:35.834
BUT YOU, DEXTER,

19:35.834 --> 19:38.458
WITH EVERYTHING
I'VE PUT YOU THROUGH,

19:38.458 --> 19:41.250
I GET THE SENSE
YOU COULD WALK AWAY

19:41.250 --> 19:44.834
WITHOUT THE NEED
TO KILL ME.

19:44.834 --> 19:46.333
- MY NEEDS
ARE DIFFERENT.

19:46.333 --> 19:49.166
- WHY DO YOU DO IT?
WHY ARE YOU A KILLER?

19:49.166 --> 19:53.333
- IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO HANNAH, YOU'LL FIND OUT.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.208
I NEED A FAVOR.

20:01.208 --> 20:02.417
- OKAY.

20:02.417 --> 20:05.709
IF YOU DO ME ONE AND WATCH
WHERE YOU'RE DRIPPING.

20:05.709 --> 20:07.500
- ISAAK SIRKO.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.083
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?

20:09.083 --> 20:11.417
- CALL OFF
THE 24-HOUR SURVEILLANCE.

20:11.417 --> 20:15.542
- LIKE HELL I WILL.

20:15.542 --> 20:19.166
WHAT THE FUCK
IS GOING ON?

20:19.166 --> 20:22.917
- SOMEONE'S AFTER ISAAK.

20:22.917 --> 20:25.166
TWO SOMEONES.

20:25.166 --> 20:28.125
YOU KNOW, LIKE THE GUY
IN HIS APARTMENT BUT WORSE.

20:28.125 --> 20:30.542
ACTUALLY, MUCH WORSE.

20:30.542 --> 20:32.000
- SO YOU WANT ME TO PULL
THE SURVEILLANCE,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.083
SO THE TWO SOMEONES
CAN...

20:34.083 --> 20:35.375
DO WHAT THEY'RE HIRED
TO DO?

20:35.375 --> 20:37.500
- NOT EXACTLY.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.875
- WELL, THEN I'M NOT EXACTLY
PULLING THE SURVEILLANCE.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.250
HE'LL COME AFTER YOU.

20:41.250 --> 20:45.959
- NO, HE WON'T
BECAUSE HE AND I ARE...

20:45.959 --> 20:48.792
WORKING TOGETHER.

20:48.792 --> 20:50.834
- ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?

20:50.834 --> 20:52.875
- ISAAK TOOK HANNAH.

20:52.875 --> 20:55.959
HE GOT WIND ABOUT THESE TWO GUYS
COMING AFTER HIM,

20:55.959 --> 20:58.083
AND HE TOOK HANNAH
AS LEVERAGE AGAINST ME.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.750
HE'S GONNA KILL HER
IF I DON'T HELP HIM.

20:59.750 --> 21:03.333
- AND I SHOULD GIVE
A SHIT WHY?

21:03.333 --> 21:06.000
- BECAUSE I DO?

21:06.000 --> 21:09.250
- DEXTER, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAVE HER.

21:09.250 --> 21:10.500
YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BE
WITH HER.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.709
IT'S--IT'S NOT EVEN LIKE
YOU WILL HAVE

21:11.709 --> 21:12.917
A FUCKING FUTURE.

21:12.917 --> 21:15.208
YOU'RE BOTH
WHAT YOU ARE.

21:15.208 --> 21:16.709
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S IN OUR FUTURE.

21:16.709 --> 21:17.834
I DON'T WANT ISAAK
TO KILL HER.

21:17.834 --> 21:18.875
THAT'S ALL I KNOW

21:18.875 --> 21:22.083
RIGHT NOW.

21:22.083 --> 21:23.166
- WHO DO YOU THINK
HAS HER?

21:23.166 --> 21:25.041
- HIS ASSISTANT.

21:25.041 --> 21:27.917
JURG.

21:27.917 --> 21:29.333
IF I CAN FIND OUT WHERE,

21:29.333 --> 21:30.959
ISAAK WON'T HAVE
ANY MORE LEVERAGE ON ME,

21:30.959 --> 21:32.667
AND I CAN KILL HIM.

21:32.667 --> 21:33.917
- WELL, HOW DO YOU EXPECT
TO FIND JURG

21:33.917 --> 21:37.625
IF YOU'RE HANGING OUT
WITH ISAAK?

21:37.625 --> 21:40.417
- I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

21:40.417 --> 21:45.291
- YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
THIS MORNING?

21:45.291 --> 21:49.959
I WAS LYING IN BED,
STARING AT THE CEILING,

21:49.959 --> 21:52.041
FEELING THE SUN,
AND LISTENING TO THE WAVES,

21:52.041 --> 21:55.542
AND...

21:55.542 --> 21:59.625
FOR A SECOND, EVERYTHING WAS
JUST LIKE IT USED TO BE.

21:59.625 --> 22:00.959
STEAKS AND BEER

22:00.959 --> 22:05.333
AND...BAD MOVIES
ON THE COUCH.

22:07.959 --> 22:11.208
AND THEN I BLINKED.

22:11.208 --> 22:14.458
AND NOW IT'S BURRITOS
AND HIRED KILLERS

22:14.458 --> 22:17.959
AND FAVORS
AND...

22:17.959 --> 22:20.375
FUCKING XANAX TO GET ME
TO TOMORROW MORNING,

22:20.375 --> 22:23.792
SO I CAN HAVE
THAT HALF-SECOND OF PEACE.

22:27.291 --> 22:29.875
I'LL PULL
THE SURVEILLANCE,

22:29.875 --> 22:31.959
BUT DON'T YOU EVER EXPECT ME
TO BE OKAY

22:31.959 --> 22:34.625
WITH WHO
YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR.

22:34.625 --> 22:38.000
DEAL?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.041
- DEAL.

23:04.625 --> 23:06.041
- TOM.

23:06.041 --> 23:09.709
- AND A GREAT CREATURE AROSE
FROM THE DEPTHS.

23:09.709 --> 23:12.041
TOKYO'S THAT WAY,
MARIA.

23:12.041 --> 23:15.125
- NICE TO SEE YOU TOO,
TOM.

23:15.125 --> 23:18.125
I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY
AND SEE HOW YOU WERE DOING.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.208
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

23:19.208 --> 23:21.792
- BULLSHIT.

23:21.792 --> 23:23.875
NOW, YOU HAVE EXACTLY

23:23.875 --> 23:25.875
THE TIME IT TAKES FOR ME
TO FINISH MY DRINK

23:25.875 --> 23:29.041
TO EXPLAIN
WHY YOU'RE REALLY HERE.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.041
- LITTLE EARLY
FOR SCOTCH.

23:31.041 --> 23:33.041
- THE JOY
OF RETIREMENT.

23:33.041 --> 23:35.709

50:03.875 --> 50:06.709
- THEN WHAT IS IT?

50:12.542 --> 50:17.166
- DEATH HAS ALWAYS
CALMED ME.

50:17.166 --> 50:20.750
IT'S SOOTHING.

50:20.750 --> 50:22.417
PREDICTABLE.

50:22.417 --> 50:25.834
INEVITABLE.

50:25.834 --> 50:29.917
WITH A KNIFE IN MY HAND,
I FEEL IT'S MINE TO CONTROL.

50:29.917 --> 50:31.500
- IT GIVES YOU INTIMACY.

50:31.500 --> 50:34.417
- YES, BUT--

50:34.417 --> 50:36.333
- IT NEVER LASTS.

50:36.333 --> 50:37.834
IT'S OVER,

50:37.834 --> 50:40.709
THEN YOU--
YOU MOVE ON.

50:43.625 --> 50:44.583
- BUT NOW,

50:44.583 --> 50:49.041
WITH HANNAH,

50:49.041 --> 50:52.083
I FEEL LIKE
I DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL,

50:52.083 --> 50:54.542
AND I'M NOT SURE
I WANT TO MOVE ON.

50:54.542 --> 50:57.709
- I WAS LIKE YOU.

50:57.709 --> 51:01.542
SO DETACHED...

51:01.542 --> 51:03.542
UNTIL VIKTOR.

51:03.542 --> 51:05.166
- WAS IT WORTH IT?

51:05.166 --> 51:07.667
YOUR FEELINGS FOR HIM
COST YOU EVERYTHING.

51:07.667 --> 51:09.959
- OH, GOD, YES.

51:09.959 --> 51:13.834
BEING WITH HIM,

51:13.834 --> 51:16.959
I NEVER HAD TO HIDE.

51:16.959 --> 51:20.792
I WAS FINALLY--

51:20.792 --> 51:23.709
- ALIVE.

51:23.709 --> 51:26.500
- THERE'S HOPE
FOR YOU YET.

51:53.709 --> 51:55.083
- WATCH ANY WESTERN,
AND YOU'LL KNOW

51:55.083 --> 51:57.375
A MAN OUT FOR VENGEANCE
SHOULD DIG TWO GRAVES,

51:57.375 --> 52:01.333
ONE FOR HIS ENEMY
AND ONE FOR HIMSELF.

52:01.333 --> 52:02.834
I WON'T BE NEEDING MINE,

52:02.834 --> 52:07.583
BUT I'LL SEE TO IT
THAT ISAAK ISN'T ALONE IN HIS.

52:07.583 --> 52:11.417
- AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHY YOU
WERE TAKEN BY THE DECEASED?

52:11.417 --> 52:12.667
- NO.

52:12.667 --> 52:15.458
HE BARELY SPOKE.

52:15.458 --> 52:17.667
- SO HE CHAINED YOU UP,

52:17.667 --> 52:19.166
YOU GOT FREE,

52:19.166 --> 52:21.041
HE STABBED YOU,

52:21.041 --> 52:22.417
AND THEN YOU
BEAT HIM TO DEATH.

52:22.417 --> 52:25.083
- AS I STATED,
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

52:25.083 --> 52:26.000
- OH, I KNOW.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.166
STILL, THERE WAS
A LOT OF BLOOD.

52:29.166 --> 52:30.583
I MEAN, I KNOW
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME

52:30.583 --> 52:33.792
YOU'VE GOTTEN
YOUR HANDS BLOODY.

52:33.792 --> 52:35.250
- ARE WE FINISHED?

52:35.250 --> 52:36.667
- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME

52:36.667 --> 52:39.458
REFLECTS
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

52:39.458 --> 52:41.875
BUT, YEAH, SURE,
WE CAN BE DONE.

52:41.875 --> 52:45.875
- HOW IS IT THAT YOU
WERE THE ONE THAT FOUND ME?

52:45.875 --> 52:47.959
- I'M A COP.

52:47.959 --> 52:50.500
IT'S MY JOB TO FOLLOW THROUGH
ON ANONYMOUS TIPS.

52:50.500 --> 52:51.959
- WHERE WAS YOUR BACKUP?

52:51.959 --> 52:53.709
- LIEUTENANT'S PREROGATIVE.

52:53.709 --> 52:56.458
- DOCTOR SAID
I WAS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE

52:56.458 --> 52:57.500
WHEN YOU FOUND ME.

52:57.500 --> 52:59.291
- YEP.

52:59.291 --> 53:02.208
- SO GIVEN YOUR FEELINGS
ABOUT ME,

53:02.208 --> 53:06.834
WHY NOT JUST LET ME DIE?

53:06.834 --> 53:09.500
- I WAS DOING MY JOB.

53:09.500 --> 53:12.375
- WAS IT 'CAUSE OF DEXTER?

53:16.250 --> 53:19.125
- NO.

53:19.125 --> 53:20.125
I THINK
IT'S ABOUT FUCKING TIME

53:20.125 --> 53:24.834
I START DOING THINGS
FOR MYSELF.

53:24.834 --> 53:26.166
MAYBE YOU CAN BE FINE

53:26.166 --> 53:28.083
WITH BEING RESPONSIBLE
FOR SOMEONE'S DEATH,

53:28.083 --> 53:30.792
BUT I CAN'T.
THAT'S--

53:30.792 --> 53:34.333
THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.

53:38.792 --> 53:41.083
- I GOT HERE
AS FAST AS I COULD.

53:41.083 --> 53:42.542
- EVERYTHING
TAKEN CARE OF?

53:42.542 --> 53:47.959
- ALL TAKEN CARE OF.

53:47.959 --> 53:51.083
- THEN I GUESS
I'LL GO.

53:54.542 --> 53:57.250
- YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

53:57.250 --> 54:00.000
- YEAH.
I'M GONNA BE FINE.

54:10.792 --> 54:12.083
- IT'S ONLY 12 STITCHES.

54:12.083 --> 54:15.250
I'M GONNA BE
OUT OF HERE TOMORROW.

54:20.291 --> 54:25.000
GOD, YOU'RE SHAKING.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.208
- WHEN YOU ASKED ME
ON MY BOAT

54:26.208 --> 54:27.750
IF I'D EVER BEEN SCARED
LIKE THAT,

54:27.750 --> 54:30.709
I HAVE.

54:30.709 --> 54:35.750
TWICE.

54:35.750 --> 54:39.291
WHEN I WAS THREE,
SEEING MY MOTHER MURDERED.

54:42.083 --> 54:44.250
AND WHEN I REALIZED
THESE PAST FEW DAYS

54:44.250 --> 54:48.250
THAT I MIGHT
NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

54:52.917 --> 54:54.917
- WELL, THAT WASN'T SO HARD,
WAS IT?

54:54.917 --> 54:57.417
- [sighing]
I DON'T KNOW.

55:00.041 --> 55:02.750
I'M NOT SURE

55:02.750 --> 55:06.083
WHAT THIS IS,

55:06.083 --> 55:07.625
EXACTLY.

55:07.625 --> 55:10.834
OR WHAT'S...

55:10.834 --> 55:13.917
COMING.

55:16.667 --> 55:18.834
[sighs]

55:18.834 --> 55:20.125
MAYBE THAT'S
HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE,

55:20.125 --> 55:23.250
OUT OF MY CONTROL.

55:44.250 --> 55:45.709
ALL I KNOW IS
THAT WHEN I'M WITH YOU,

55:45.709 --> 55:49.542
I FEEL...

55:53.709 --> 55:56.792
SAFE.
