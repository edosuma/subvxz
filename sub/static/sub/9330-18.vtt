WEBVTT

00:02.735 --> 00:05.796
See? I told you there was
plenty of storage in the kitchen.

00:05.896 --> 00:07.220
What about all that stuff?

00:07.320 --> 00:10.204
You can't expect me to solve
every problem this apartment faces.

00:11.508 --> 00:14.652
Hey. Hey, have you guys seen
the match to this earring?

00:14.752 --> 00:16.819
It's really sharp, and I
don't want Emma to find it.

00:16.854 --> 00:18.787
I already checked the
liquor store, the nail salon,

00:18.839 --> 00:21.740
and the bar, so, this is
the only other place I go.

00:21.742 --> 00:24.171
Yeah, I'll check my room
once Emma's up from her nap.

00:24.271 --> 00:25.570
Hey, can you watch her tonight?

00:25.605 --> 00:27.305
I have my first official date
with Sam, and I want to remove

00:27.340 --> 00:30.208
all evidence that what we're
going to do can lead to one of her.

00:30.243 --> 00:32.527
Remember what I always say.

00:32.561 --> 00:34.212
Both: For the love of God,

00:34.214 --> 00:36.447
don't be an idiot, wear a condom.

00:36.449 --> 00:37.582
You're such good boys.

00:37.634 --> 00:39.534
Mom, you don't have to worry, okay?

00:39.569 --> 00:41.452
I bought a super-size
box at the superstore.

00:41.454 --> 00:43.454
There is so much safety
in my room right now,

00:43.490 --> 00:44.555
nothing bad could possibly happen.

00:44.591 --> 00:47.425
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

00:47.427 --> 00:48.559

So, how's my favorite bartender?

01:02.409 --> 01:04.191
We still on for tonight?

01:04.244 --> 01:07.445
We could be on right now, but I'm afraid
it might scare away some of the customers.

01:08.581 --> 01:11.416
Do you have anything in
particular you'd like to do?

01:11.451 --> 01:13.334
Hmm, I'll leave it up to you,

01:13.370 --> 01:15.503
but I was hoping we
could make it... special.

01:15.538 --> 01:19.340
Well, then you're in luck
'cause special is my specialty.

You know, I may have
had my reservations,

01:30.603 --> 01:32.520
but I think they're
pretty good together.

01:32.555 --> 01:36.357
Really? 'Cause you tried to break
them up like a hundred times.

01:36.393 --> 01:40.361
Yeah. Well, I possibly might
have been wrong about her.

01:40.447 --> 01:42.480
Hey, maybe we should share

01:42.532 --> 01:45.450
the secret to our perfect
relationship with them.

01:45.485 --> 01:48.536
You mean the one where we were fighting for
two months and we just got back together?

01:48.571 --> 01:50.488
Yeah, that one.

01:50.540 --> 01:52.373
- All right. So, maybe we could...
- No.

01:52.409 --> 01:53.825
- Well, can I suggest...
- Not getting involved.

01:53.877 --> 01:56.327
- Can you at least tell Ben...
- No. We are minding our own business.

01:56.379 --> 01:57.412
How about...

01:59.499 --> 02:01.332
You know what? You can't keep doing that

02:01.384 --> 02:03.468
every time you want to win an argument.

02:03.503 --> 02:06.337
Even though it works.

02:06.339 --> 02:08.506
- Ooh. I really need to get back.
- Oh, yeah.

02:08.508 --> 02:12.393
Lunch was fun, but, hopefully,
we can order dessert next time,

02:12.429 --> 02:14.512
- if you catch my drift.
- Oh. Oh...

02:14.514 --> 02:17.265
Everyone caught it,
Little Miss Not-So-Subtle.

02:18.351 --> 02:19.517
Just try not to catch anything else.

02:19.569 --> 02:20.518
Am I right, huh?

02:20.570 --> 02:23.404
- Good one. Come on.
- Mrs. Wheeler,

02:23.440 --> 02:25.323
Mrs. Wheeler, this is Renee.

02:25.358 --> 02:27.358
Renee, this is the spawn of Satan.

02:27.410 --> 02:29.410
- I'll see you tonight, all right?
- Mm.

02:31.448 --> 02:33.364
- Aw.
- (Sighs)

02:33.366 --> 02:34.499
She's cute.

02:34.534 --> 02:36.367
What am I missing?

02:36.369 --> 02:39.537
Renee is my dad's New
York assistant, okay?

02:39.539 --> 02:43.374
I go by the office once a
month to pick up my check,

02:43.376 --> 02:45.376
and I picked her up along the way.

02:45.378 --> 02:47.545
Okay, so she's dating for
money. Now I got it, okay.

02:47.547 --> 02:52.433
No. But she does keep pressuring
me to tell my dad that we're dating,

02:52.469 --> 02:54.385
which I definitely do not want to do,

02:54.437 --> 02:56.354
because I know he would not approve

02:56.389 --> 02:58.272
of me seeing someone in his office.

02:58.324 --> 03:00.224
I mean, mostly because he
keeps saying stuff like,

03:00.260 --> 03:01.392
"Stop hitting on the
women in my office,"

03:01.394 --> 03:03.327
or, "Get off my secretary."

03:03.379 --> 03:06.147
- Dads.
- I know, right?

03:06.199 --> 03:09.167
Ooh, that reminds me. Your
dad called me to tell me

03:09.202 --> 03:12.220
that he's coming into town and
he wants to take me out to dinner.

03:12.255 --> 03:14.522
Clearly, not over the Bon-Bon.

03:16.543 --> 03:19.393
Do you think that you can put in
a good word about me and Renee?

03:19.429 --> 03:21.345
I mean, maybe if he
hears how happy we are

03:21.397 --> 03:23.531
from someone who isn't
me, he won't mind.

03:23.583 --> 03:25.450
Oh, and, Mrs.
Wheeler, I... uh...

03:25.485 --> 03:27.335
I know shouldn't have to say this,

03:27.387 --> 03:32.090
but please don't sleep
with my Dad. Again.

03:33.610 --> 03:35.126
Okay.

03:35.161 --> 03:37.095
But only because I'm married.

03:37.147 --> 03:38.179
Not because you asked me.

03:41.634 --> 03:43.484
(toys squeaking)

03:44.537 --> 03:47.472
Wow, you're cleaning.
You really do like Sam.

03:47.524 --> 03:49.524
More like shoving and hiding.
But, yeah, I really do.

03:51.544 --> 03:54.445
So, you taking her to someplace fun?

03:54.481 --> 03:56.464
Oh, you know it. She's
made it pretty clear

03:56.499 --> 04:01.235
there's only one stop on
this date train... my bedroom.

04:01.271 --> 04:03.337
So, I'm assuming we'll start
out at a nice restaurant.

04:03.373 --> 04:06.190
Someplace romantic.

04:06.242 --> 04:10.194
I'm sorry. We are talking
about Ben Wheeler, right?

04:10.230 --> 04:11.529
We are.

04:11.531 --> 04:13.464
I think you underestimate him.

04:13.466 --> 04:14.565
He asked me what I wanted,

04:14.601 --> 04:17.135
and I told him I
wanted it to be special.

04:17.170 --> 04:19.403
She really said she
wanted to make it special?

04:19.439 --> 04:21.439
Ho! You are so in!

04:21.474 --> 04:24.475
I know, right? What else
could that possibly mean?

04:24.527 --> 04:27.261
I was so afraid she was going to
make me jump through a ton of hoops.

04:27.313 --> 04:29.247
To be honest, after all
that's happened between us,

04:29.282 --> 04:31.132
I wouldn't mind if he jumped
through a couple of hoops.

04:32.318 --> 04:36.170
Totally. I mean, they never
respect you if they don't.

04:36.222 --> 04:38.573
Well, sounds like it's
going to be an amazing date.

04:38.608 --> 04:40.575
It's going to be an amazing date.

04:42.612 --> 04:45.163
Oh, Marshall. I just want you to know

04:45.165 --> 04:46.597
that if I hadn't hooked up with a man

04:46.599 --> 04:48.482
half your age with twice your stamina,

04:48.535 --> 04:50.551
I would be all over that!

04:50.587 --> 04:52.436
Mm! (growls)

04:53.540 --> 04:55.389
Obviously, I'm flattered.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.391
But your relationship with Brad

04:57.443 --> 04:59.377
is actually the reason
I wanted to talk to you.

05:00.380 --> 05:04.282
You see, I've met my very own Brad.

05:04.334 --> 05:08.069
Oh, for the love of men instead
of women, you're gay too?

05:09.122 --> 05:13.107
No. I'm in love with a younger woman.

05:13.142 --> 05:15.493
Oh, she works in my New York
office, but we speak every day.

05:15.528 --> 05:17.461
Mostly about paperwork.

05:17.497 --> 05:18.896
Though I've come to
suspect she feels as

05:18.922 --> 05:20.431
strongly about me as she
does the paperwork.

05:20.433 --> 05:22.450
Ooh! Slow down, cowboy.

05:22.502 --> 05:24.468
So, why don't you just ask her out?

05:24.520 --> 05:26.487
Oh, Bonnie, she's a lot younger.

05:26.522 --> 05:28.472
Aren't you worried
about what people say?

05:28.508 --> 05:31.325
Brad is literally the greatest
thing that ever happened to me,

05:31.377 --> 05:33.394
and that includes at
least one of my kids.

05:33.479 --> 05:38.249
Marshall, life is short. Lock that
down before he realizes how hot he is

05:38.251 --> 05:40.568
and that he can get someone his own age.

05:40.620 --> 05:42.186
Before she.

05:42.222 --> 05:44.522
Before she realizes it.

05:45.575 --> 05:47.475
You know, you make
an excellent argument.

05:47.510 --> 05:50.127
I will, as they say,

05:50.163 --> 05:50.578
go for it with Renee.

05:50.613 --> 05:52.496
Wait. Renee?

05:52.498 --> 05:53.481
From work?

05:54.567 --> 05:56.534
The girl that you
like is... is Renee?

05:56.536 --> 05:58.469
From your office?

05:58.471 --> 06:00.421
Thank you for summing
that up so succinctly. Yes.

06:01.507 --> 06:05.276
Wow. Marshall, I am so happy for you.

06:05.278 --> 06:08.179
I am just gonna go... (mumbles)

06:12.285 --> 06:13.234
(panting) Tucker!

06:13.269 --> 06:14.235
- Oh, my...
- (Renee shrieks)

06:14.270 --> 06:15.553
Mrs. Wheeler, what are you doing?

06:15.588 --> 06:17.555
Hey, Tucker, can I talk
to you for a second?

06:17.557 --> 06:20.458
Oh. FYI, Renee. There's a fire
escape right out that window.

06:22.111 --> 06:23.110
(door closes)

06:24.430 --> 06:25.379
(mutters)

06:25.431 --> 06:26.530
What is wrong with you, woman?

06:26.566 --> 06:28.366
I thought you might like to know

06:28.401 --> 06:30.451
that your father has
a new lady in his life.

06:30.486 --> 06:32.370
- My dad has a girlfriend?
- Sort of.

06:32.405 --> 06:34.472
She works in his New York office.

06:34.507 --> 06:36.357
Guess what her name is?

06:36.392 --> 06:38.209
- Renee?
- Bingo!

06:38.261 --> 06:40.144
Oh, thank God, it's not Renee.

06:42.382 --> 06:44.565
Oh, hey, Ben.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.118
Wait. Aren't you supposed
to be on a date with Sam?

06:47.170 --> 06:48.569
Honestly, it ended before it started.

06:51.557 --> 06:52.540
(coughs)

06:52.592 --> 06:54.458
Ben: I got all dressed up.

06:54.494 --> 06:56.577
I was wearing that new Henley, you know,
'cause it makes me look like I have pecs.

06:56.629 --> 06:58.396
(knocking)

07:00.383 --> 07:01.666
Hi, Sam.

07:01.668 --> 07:03.351
Ben: And being a gentleman,
I gave her a huge compliment.

07:03.386 --> 07:04.402
You look hot!

07:04.454 --> 07:06.253
Thanks.

07:06.289 --> 07:08.289
I'm so excited for our special night.

07:08.324 --> 07:11.125
Me too. I wouldn't let milady starve,

07:11.177 --> 07:14.111
so, I prepared a fine
selection of hors d'oeuvres.

07:15.148 --> 07:16.080
Champagne?

07:17.150 --> 07:18.249
Hmm. And a condom!

07:18.284 --> 07:20.217
Ah! Emma found my stash

07:20.253 --> 07:22.169
and she's been hiding them
all over the house. Okay.

07:22.221 --> 07:24.071
(chuckles)

07:24.107 --> 07:25.406
(door opens, slams shut)

07:27.143 --> 07:28.075
And she was gone.

07:29.579 --> 07:32.380
Sam. Hey, I got your
9-1-1. What's wrong?

07:32.432 --> 07:34.415
Wait. Aren't you supposed to be
on your date with Ben right now?

07:34.450 --> 07:37.335
Yeah. It pretty much
ended before it started.

07:38.488 --> 07:41.255
Hey, Sam. You look hot.

07:42.342 --> 07:44.241
Sam: So Ben looks
like he hasn't showered

07:44.243 --> 07:46.210
in three days and smells like dead yak.

07:48.164 --> 07:49.230
You ready for our special night?

07:49.265 --> 07:51.482
I'm ready. Why aren't you dressed yet?

07:51.484 --> 07:53.501
You mean, why aren't I undressed yet?

07:54.554 --> 07:56.504
I thought we were going out?

07:56.556 --> 07:59.390
Why go out when everything
we need is right here?

07:59.425 --> 08:01.292
I'm actually a little hungry.

08:01.327 --> 08:02.393
Oh, don't worry.

08:02.428 --> 08:04.328
There's some chips next
to this bowl of condoms.

08:05.448 --> 08:08.199
And that's when I got
the hell out of there.

08:08.234 --> 08:10.334
The worst part is, I don't think
he even knows what he did wrong.

08:10.386 --> 08:12.336
I honestly have no
idea what I did wrong.

08:17.145 --> 08:18.094
Oh, hey.

08:19.130 --> 08:20.096
Did you hear about Ben and Sam?

08:20.098 --> 08:22.916
Yeah. It's so sad. He really likes her.

08:22.968 --> 08:25.034
None of this would've happened if
we had just given them some advice.

08:25.070 --> 08:27.403
But we agreed, we're not
getting involved, right?

08:27.405 --> 08:28.421
Right.

08:28.473 --> 08:31.207
Ben can figure it out
on his own, can't he?

08:31.243 --> 08:32.207
Oh, totally.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.309
And I mean, Sam's going
to figure it out too.

08:34.361 --> 08:35.328
- Isn't she?
- Of course.

08:38.232 --> 08:41.116
Um, you know, hey, I forgot
to tell Ben something.

08:41.119 --> 08:43.052
- I'll just be a second.
- Yeah, no worries.

08:43.087 --> 08:44.187
Take your time, honey.

08:48.043 --> 08:49.175
Sam, hey.

08:49.227 --> 08:51.077
Uh, I was wondering if you
wanted to meet tomorrow morning.

08:51.112 --> 08:53.963
I'd love to "Ben" your
ear about something.

08:55.016 --> 08:56.366
Oh, uh... about Ben.

08:56.401 --> 08:57.951
I thought that was kind of clear

08:58.003 --> 08:59.302
with the whole "Ben your ear" thing.

09:01.990 --> 09:04.257
Okay, so I've been thinking
about the whole Ben thing.

09:04.292 --> 09:06.309
And I think I know where you went wrong.

09:07.362 --> 09:09.212
Where I went wrong?

09:09.214 --> 09:12.315
Well, remember when you crawled into
his bed a couple of months ago, naked?

09:12.317 --> 09:15.084
I think you may have sent
him the wrong message.

09:15.136 --> 09:17.253
You know, that you're kind of slutty,

09:17.289 --> 09:20.006
so I think you need to
rerecord that message.

09:20.041 --> 09:21.190
And what's the new message?

09:21.226 --> 09:22.992
That you're hard to get.

09:22.994 --> 09:24.927
Keep your pants on, Sam.

09:24.980 --> 09:26.095
Keep your pants on.

09:29.050 --> 09:31.317
So, I've been thinking about what
you said last night, and you're right.

09:31.369 --> 09:33.303
I came on way too strong.

09:33.338 --> 09:34.354
Girls want what they can't have.

09:34.389 --> 09:35.355
Exactly.

09:35.407 --> 09:37.340
Last time Sam thought
you liked somebody else,

09:37.375 --> 09:39.325
she ended crawling into your bed naked.

09:39.361 --> 09:42.211
So, if you think if I ignore
Sam, she'll want me more?

09:42.213 --> 09:44.080
She couldn't want you any less.

09:47.302 --> 09:50.219
(chuckles) Um...

09:50.255 --> 09:53.072
So... So, there's kind of... there's
kind of something I need to tell you.

09:55.043 --> 09:56.025
I met someone.

09:56.061 --> 09:58.061
Oh, that's wonderful, son.

09:58.063 --> 09:59.412
What's his name?

10:00.465 --> 10:04.000
Dad, for the hundredth
time, I'm not gay.

10:04.002 --> 10:05.351
Oh. Well, then...

10:05.387 --> 10:07.954
- remind me to call your mother.
- (Mouths)

10:08.006 --> 10:11.240
But... I have met a wonderful girl, too.

10:13.411 --> 10:14.344
There's no easy way to say it.

10:15.347 --> 10:17.230
She's quite a bit younger than me,

10:17.282 --> 10:20.149
but I guess that's what
making my heart go pitter-pat.

10:20.185 --> 10:22.285
I tell you, son. I was a lonely
lump of a man before I met Renee.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.054
Yeah, about Renee.
You know, it's...

10:25.106 --> 10:27.040
I was worried about
the age difference, too.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.124
But Bonnie helped me realize,

10:28.176 --> 10:30.059
I was wasting my life
by not pursuing it.

10:31.112 --> 10:33.046
Oh, that-that Mrs. Wheeler!

10:33.081 --> 10:36.999
Oh, she... she...
she's so helpful.

10:37.035 --> 10:39.402
She's so damn helpful.

10:41.289 --> 10:42.422
If everything goes right,

10:42.457 --> 10:46.242
you could have your
very first stepmother.

10:46.244 --> 10:48.127
What?

10:48.163 --> 10:49.195
Wait a minute.

10:49.230 --> 10:51.247
You're going to ask Renee to marry you?

10:51.249 --> 10:54.183
Don't you think you should
maybe ask her to dinner first?

10:55.286 --> 10:57.053
You know what?

10:57.055 --> 10:58.488
That is excellent advice.

10:58.523 --> 11:00.123
I will ask Renee to marry me at dinner.

11:04.012 --> 11:05.044
Mrs. Wheeler?

11:05.080 --> 11:06.996
Have you ever heard of knocking?

11:07.031 --> 11:08.314
It's my room.

11:09.367 --> 11:11.267
Okay. That's a good point.

11:11.302 --> 11:12.368
So, how did it go with your dad?

11:12.404 --> 11:13.369
Terrible.

11:13.421 --> 11:15.388
Yeah, I thought it was
just a little crush,

11:15.423 --> 11:18.291
but now... but now, he's going
to look like a creepy old man

11:18.326 --> 11:20.176
when he proposes to a girl

11:20.211 --> 11:22.145
who's young enough to be dating me...

11:22.197 --> 11:24.163
and is!

11:24.215 --> 11:26.232
This is going to destroy him.

11:26.267 --> 11:28.151
Do you want me to write
this up in your journal?

11:28.203 --> 11:31.137
You seemed pretty anxious about
this conversation yesterday.

11:31.172 --> 11:32.998
Okay. You know what?

11:33.098 --> 11:34.114
- Oh.
- No.

11:34.149 --> 11:36.149
And even if I wasn't dating Renee,

11:36.185 --> 11:39.052
the idea of my dad
dating a girl of my age

11:39.104 --> 11:40.487
is so wrong.

11:40.522 --> 11:43.423
It'd be like us together.

11:43.475 --> 11:46.409
You wouldn't be the first of
Ben's friends, I can assure you.

11:48.430 --> 11:50.280
Don't tell Ben.

11:50.332 --> 11:52.513
But you know what? That's it.

11:53.601 --> 11:57.519
If my dad could see how ridiculous
he'd look with someone my age,

11:57.555 --> 12:01.407
he'd come to his senses and end
this silliness with Renee on his own.

12:01.442 --> 12:03.576
Mrs. Wheeler, you've got to help me.

12:03.611 --> 12:05.394
Of course I will, Tucker.

12:05.429 --> 12:07.396
You know I think of you like a son.

12:07.431 --> 12:09.415
Really? Since when?

12:09.450 --> 12:10.833
Since I boinked your dad.

12:15.473 --> 12:18.277
(laughing loudly) My God!

12:18.377 --> 12:20.394
CeeCee, you are so funny.

12:20.429 --> 12:23.013
We have really have got to
have a drink one of these days.

12:23.113 --> 12:24.045
Please don't touch me.

12:25.215 --> 12:28.049
Ow. Sam better get a move on

12:28.084 --> 12:30.084
'cause it looks like Ben is moving on.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.136
Look, I know you're gay,

12:32.172 --> 12:34.889
but stare at these for a
moment or two and beer's on me.

12:34.924 --> 12:36.040
(laughs loudly)

12:36.092 --> 12:38.276
Oh, my God! You're hilarious!

12:39.913 --> 12:41.896
Yep. Well, Ben better move fast,

12:41.931 --> 12:43.915
'cause it looks like
Sam's moving even faster.

12:45.251 --> 12:47.185
Dude, your advice isn't working.

12:47.187 --> 12:49.153
Sam's not in to me. She
won't even look at me.

12:49.205 --> 12:51.305
I can't believe I'm about to say
this, but I think Ben and Sam...

12:51.358 --> 12:54.075
or as I was going
to call us, "Bam!"...

12:54.110 --> 12:55.176
are over and out.

12:55.228 --> 12:57.995
Oh, I barely helped.

12:58.048 --> 12:59.964
No, man. It was all you.

12:59.999 --> 13:01.949
It was great advice, bro,
but it just didn't work.

13:04.471 --> 13:08.306
I cannot believe you. We promised each
other that we wouldn't get involved,

13:08.342 --> 13:10.275
and here you are getting involved.

13:10.327 --> 13:12.822
I mean, does... does your
word mean nothing to you?

13:13.347 --> 13:15.280
Riley, I don't think you were right.

13:15.332 --> 13:16.698
Ben's not into me.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.920
He's literally into everything but me.

13:19.020 --> 13:19.986
I give up.

13:26.261 --> 13:27.343
Oh, it was worth a try.

13:27.395 --> 13:30.162
I'm sorry. It's just that

13:30.198 --> 13:32.265
Sam wants to feel special
before she has sex,

13:32.300 --> 13:34.183
so I may have told her
to play hard to get.

13:34.219 --> 13:36.202
I told Ben the same thing.

13:36.237 --> 13:37.253
He's just trying to be with the girl

13:37.288 --> 13:39.105
he's been in love
with for over a decade.

13:39.107 --> 13:40.423
It's no wonder he's
having trouble focusing.

13:41.476 --> 13:43.109
Can we just agree that they need to be

13:43.111 --> 13:44.994
as happy as we are and help them?

13:45.046 --> 13:46.028
- Yes.
- All right.

13:46.064 --> 13:48.331
- You know what to tell Ben, right?
- Totally.

13:48.366 --> 13:51.300
Oh, hey, Ben. Quick tweak to the plan.

13:51.352 --> 13:52.401
You need to show Sam that she's special

13:52.437 --> 13:54.287
and it's not just about sex.

13:57.408 --> 13:59.325
Hey, Sam. New plan.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.161
Uh, you need to sleep
with Ben immediately.

14:05.907 --> 14:07.450
So now you want me to sleep

14:07.550 --> 14:08.175
with him?

14:08.624 --> 14:10.452
Look, I feel terrible,

14:10.552 --> 14:12.703
but I may have given you
some bad advice before.

14:12.803 --> 14:16.436
Ben is crazy about you, but
he won't be able to focus

14:16.536 --> 14:18.386
and act like a normal human being

14:18.421 --> 14:19.504
until he gets past the whole sex thing.

14:19.556 --> 14:20.521
Oh, I don't know.

14:20.573 --> 14:21.873
Oh, you already crawled
into his bed once,

14:21.908 --> 14:24.726
what's one more time?

14:24.761 --> 14:26.694
Once you get past this,

14:26.746 --> 14:29.764
Ben will be able to relax
and be the sweet, loving guy

14:29.799 --> 14:31.733
you want him to be.

14:31.785 --> 14:32.784
I think.

14:32.819 --> 14:34.635
No, you know, actually, I'm sure.

14:34.671 --> 14:36.571
Kind of.

14:36.623 --> 14:37.538
Pretty sure.

14:39.559 --> 14:42.477
Don't you get it? She's just
waiting for you to make it special.

14:42.512 --> 14:44.429
If there's one thing I
learned about relationships,

14:44.431 --> 14:46.581
it's that women like to test men.

14:46.616 --> 14:49.784
Well, that and brunch. They
really, really like brunch.

14:51.554 --> 14:53.855
Sam is just testing you to make sure
that you're really interested in her.

14:53.890 --> 14:55.456
I've liked her since I was 14.

14:55.492 --> 14:57.792
You've wanted to have sex
with her since you were 14.

14:57.827 --> 14:59.744
Isn't that the same thing?

14:59.779 --> 15:02.597
Be strong, man. You'll get there.

15:02.649 --> 15:03.598
But until then,

15:03.633 --> 15:07.552
do not under any circumstance
have sex with her.

15:07.554 --> 15:09.620
Even if it's the apocalypse and we're
the last two people left on Earth

15:09.656 --> 15:11.472
and we need to repopulate the species?

15:12.692 --> 15:14.492
That might be an exception.

15:18.615 --> 15:20.431
Hey, you seen any good movies, lately?

15:21.451 --> 15:23.401
No. Um-mm.

15:23.436 --> 15:25.470
But I did watch a bunch
of cat videos this morning.

15:26.489 --> 15:27.855
Marshall: Absolutely not settling, Bob.

15:27.907 --> 15:29.791
I'm not the kind of
guy who settles, Bob.

15:29.826 --> 15:30.808
Everybody in the office knows that.

15:32.729 --> 15:34.829
Settling is for settlers and I don't
think that's what we want, is it?

15:38.685 --> 15:40.651
What are we, Bob? Pioneers?

15:40.653 --> 15:41.752
I don't see any covered wagons.

15:47.710 --> 15:49.560
- Mrs. Wheeler!
- I thought I heard him.

15:54.601 --> 15:56.484
Hey, Ben.

15:56.536 --> 15:58.436
Sam. Hey.

15:58.471 --> 15:59.537
Uh, I was actually just about to leave.

15:59.572 --> 16:01.405
Oh. What's the rush?

16:01.457 --> 16:04.342
The bar's officially closed.

16:04.394 --> 16:05.409
Looks like it's just you and me.

16:06.446 --> 16:07.662
Alone.

16:09.732 --> 16:11.682
N-n-n-n-n-no need
to lock that then.

16:12.969 --> 16:15.770
Check out this scratch I got from
the corner of the bar tonight.

16:15.822 --> 16:19.607
I don't suppose you have
anything you could put on it?

16:19.642 --> 16:21.110
You know what you need?

16:21.210 --> 16:22.359
Aspirin. It reduces inflammation.

16:24.146 --> 16:25.228
I should probably take some too.

16:27.232 --> 16:29.149
Geez, your dad is long-winded.

16:29.184 --> 16:31.234
My calf is starting to cramp.

16:31.270 --> 16:33.153
Tucker, would you
mind if I borrowed...

16:33.188 --> 16:34.538
Sweet rhubarb pie!

16:34.590 --> 16:36.122
(gasps) Oh, Marshall!

16:37.142 --> 16:38.108
Dad!

16:38.143 --> 16:39.492
Dad, this is her.

16:39.494 --> 16:41.461
This is the woman I've
been telling you about,

16:41.463 --> 16:43.063
my... my true love.

16:43.115 --> 16:45.332
I am in love with Bonnie Wheeler.

16:45.367 --> 16:47.450
And damn it, Dad, there's
nothing you can do about it.

16:47.486 --> 16:50.403
No matter how silly, or ridiculous,

16:50.455 --> 16:52.339
or mortifying we look together.

16:53.425 --> 16:55.275
We're getting married.

16:55.277 --> 16:56.376
Yeah. Well, after my divorce.

16:57.429 --> 16:59.179
Tucker, this is appalling,

16:59.231 --> 17:01.248
you carrying on with a
married woman and such.

17:01.283 --> 17:04.067
No reaction to the
hideous age difference?

17:04.102 --> 17:05.035
Ow.

17:06.221 --> 17:09.105
But I can't stop love.

17:09.141 --> 17:12.474
And if that's what this
is, who am I to judge?

17:12.511 --> 17:16.512
Now? Now you choose to stop
judging my life choices?

17:17.146 --> 17:19.079
Knock, knock!
Mr. Dobbs...

17:19.115 --> 17:20.948
Renee, what are you doing here?

17:20.983 --> 17:22.900
I asked her to bring by
some papers for me to sign.

17:22.935 --> 17:24.084
But congratulations are in order.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.804
Tucker just announced his engagement.

17:26.856 --> 17:29.823
Excuse me? To who? To her?

17:29.876 --> 17:31.759
Hey, Missy, you better watch your tone.

17:31.811 --> 17:34.862
No. No, no, no. Not to her,
not to anyone. This is not real.

17:34.914 --> 17:36.797
But that hickey is gonna be.

17:38.701 --> 17:40.751
I thought that we had something special.

17:40.803 --> 17:44.672
No! We do! We do! But my dad wants
something special with you too.

17:44.707 --> 17:47.691
Mr. Dobbs, you want to go out with me?

17:47.727 --> 17:48.692
He's actually in love with you.

17:48.728 --> 17:50.160
In love with her? Oh, God no.

17:50.162 --> 17:52.029
She's young enough to be my daughter.

17:52.064 --> 17:53.147
But you said you were
in love with Renee.

17:53.182 --> 17:55.082
Yeah. Renee Dorsett from HR.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.917
She's 42.

17:59.071 --> 18:02.022
Wait. How is that
anything like me and Brad?

18:02.058 --> 18:03.824
Well, aren't we both the same age?

18:03.859 --> 18:05.793
Oh, not even close!

18:07.897 --> 18:08.896
Let me help you.

18:08.948 --> 18:10.881
You have to squeeze when you pull.

18:10.917 --> 18:12.800
I got it, yeah. Just give me a second.

18:12.835 --> 18:13.851
I'm just gonna...

18:13.853 --> 18:14.818
Oh!

18:16.672 --> 18:18.672
Oh, one got in my shirt. Wanna get it?

18:18.708 --> 18:20.724
No. No, no, no. There's
plenty right here on the floor.

18:20.726 --> 18:22.693
Besides, I probably
shouldn't stand up right now.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.095
Well, here's some water.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.115
Oops. Oh, I'm so clumsy.

18:28.167 --> 18:29.700
I've spilled all over myself.

18:29.702 --> 18:32.102
I better take this off. I
don't want to catch a cold.

18:32.138 --> 18:34.021
Oh! I'll get you a towel.

18:34.073 --> 18:37.057
What the hell is your problem, Ben?

18:37.093 --> 18:38.926
Are you not interested in any of this?

18:38.978 --> 18:40.828
Whatever it is, just tell me.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.129
Of course, I'm interested.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.897
I just think there are more
important things for us to do first,

18:43.933 --> 18:44.982
like getting to know each other.

18:45.017 --> 18:46.951
We've known each other for ten years!

18:50.806 --> 18:51.755
Babe. Hey.

18:51.791 --> 18:52.906
Why am I meeting you here?

18:52.959 --> 18:55.759
Aren't Ben and Sam in the
office having sex right now?

18:55.795 --> 18:57.695
No. Why would they do that?

18:57.730 --> 19:00.631
Um, because I told Sam to have sex
with Ben in the office right now.

19:01.817 --> 19:04.068
I even gave her my old
"cut on the thigh" trick.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.086
Oh, no. I told Ben
to be super hands-off.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.457
Wait. That was a trick?

19:08.492 --> 19:10.759
Sam: No, forget it.
Just stay away from me.

19:10.811 --> 19:12.727
I'm sorry! Danny told
me you were testing me.

19:12.780 --> 19:14.830
I was trying to be super respectful.

19:15.633 --> 19:18.634
And I figured if anybody knows how to
get you into bed, it would be Danny.

19:18.669 --> 19:22.604
Seriously? Riley told me to have sex
with you and just get it over with.

19:22.640 --> 19:25.474
I figured if anyone would know how
to get you into bed, it's Riley.

19:26.610 --> 19:28.644
Wow, that is just...

19:28.646 --> 19:30.646
I wish we had both listened to Riley.

19:32.533 --> 19:34.483
I want to have sex with you, Ben.

19:34.535 --> 19:36.652
I just... need it to be special.

19:36.654 --> 19:37.653
Okay.

19:39.490 --> 19:42.491
Can you write down exactly
what you mean by "special"?

19:42.543 --> 19:44.459
How about I show you?

19:46.247 --> 19:47.629
Oh, hey, guys!

19:47.665 --> 19:49.498
We had no idea that you were here.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.667
Yeah, but it looks like you
have everything under control,

19:51.669 --> 19:53.669
so we're just going to slip out of here.

19:53.721 --> 19:56.505
Don't worry. You don't have to thank us.

20:03.630 --> 20:07.307
Not quite how I expected you to tell
your dad about us, but good enough.

20:08.964 --> 20:10.914
So, uh, where were we?

20:11.967 --> 20:14.918
About to make good use
of a few stolen condoms.

20:17.973 --> 20:19.973
So basically, if it wasn't for us,

20:20.008 --> 20:21.091
they never would have gotten together.

20:21.143 --> 20:23.092
(sighs)

20:23.321 --> 20:25.355
We're amazing.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.323
Hey, did you remember
to pick up condoms?

20:27.359 --> 20:28.757
Oh, no need.

20:28.782 --> 20:30.782
Ben had some to spare.

20:30.807 --> 20:34.179
Finally, you... me... together.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.268
Maybe we'll get our
happily ever after, after all.
