00:37.780 --> 00:40.786
The legendary Number One headband. 

00:41.418 --> 00:46.844
He promises power, omnipotence, immortality. 

00:47.508 --> 00:49.460
But at what price? 

00:49.861 --> 00:53.870
A higher than anyone can imagine. 

00:54.182 --> 00:57.479
And heavier than you can tolerate. 

02:19.375 --> 02:22.265
The headband will ... 

02:23.438 --> 02:24.936
of us. 

02:57.718 --> 02:59.214
Touche. 

03:31.660 --> 03:35.000
Die, Afro Samurai. 
-Bastard. 

04:29.463 --> 04:31.002
Son ... 

04:41.732 --> 04:43.321
Father. 

04:57.790 --> 04:59.428
Afro. 

06:45.727 --> 06:47.427
Jinno. 

07:49.260 --> 07:51.020
Remember me? 

07:51.500 --> 07:53.387
I remember you. 

07:53.832 --> 07:56.397
And what you did. 

07:57.128 --> 08:00.055
Murderer. 
Sample. 

08:01.002 --> 08:04.309
How many hundreds of lives have you stopped? 

08:04.616 --> 08:09.565
How many thousands have you lost 
of their loved ones to regret? 

08:10.258 --> 08:12.132
Now it's your turn. 

08:12.380 --> 08:15.326
I know the only one 
where you care about ... 

08:15.326 --> 08:20.534
and if I get it back from the dead 
I will play with him. 

08:21.208 --> 08:23.575
Torture him. 

08:36.065 --> 08:38.698
Your father will be punished ... 

08:39.184 --> 08:43.705
for your sins, 
Afro Samurai. 

08:44.690 --> 08:49.575
Unless you find the Number Two headband, 
and me trying to stop. 

08:50.262 --> 08:52.708
Got the guts? 

08:56.167 --> 08:59.163
Go fetch, boy. 

09:14.819 --> 09:17.366
Come get me, Afro Samurai. 

09:17.690 --> 09:20.562
With the Number One headband around my head ... 

09:20.966 --> 09:24.055
are you related to your samurai code ... 

09:25.058 --> 09:28.372
baits in icial 
and number two to be found. 

09:28.918 --> 09:30.494
Come get me. 

09:31.130 --> 09:34.581
So I heart you and your body can break. 

09:35.273 --> 09:37.682
As you have broken mine. 

10:06.321 --> 10:09.117
We are equally bad. 

10:09.117 --> 10:12.904
How are you? 
Time not given. 

10:17.226 --> 10:19.394
You start old, is not it? 

10:19.910 --> 10:24.358
Look at that poor sword now. 
It is the destruction. 

10:24.652 --> 10:27.526
Times have changed. 

10:31.753 --> 10:34.578
Why do you wear 
the Number One headband not? 

10:35.714 --> 10:37.743
I have had my revenge. 

10:38.162 --> 10:40.251
Have you learned nothing? 

10:40.863 --> 10:47.458
What your goal is, 
with that headband you never escape. 

10:47.789 --> 10:53.807
But how can that teddy bear back life? 
Did you do not already slain? 

10:53.909 --> 10:57.946
Apparently not, because he has 
made a good comeback ... 

10:57.946 --> 11:00.738
and he is well on your skin. 

11:01.425 --> 11:06.663
And you saw that girl who was with him? 
It is now the Number One. 

11:07.624 --> 11:10.298
She looks too good. 

11:10.420 --> 11:13.153
That ass was something to see. 

11:13.583 --> 11:17.418
Even in the cold rain 
I was still hot from. 

11:28.350 --> 11:30.129
It starts again. 

11:30.273 --> 11:36.450
Good. That I mean. 
We are now partners. 

11:50.124 --> 11:53.548
Are you sure this 
bone fragments are sufficient? 

11:55.772 --> 12:01.411
Fear not. About two weeks 
we are witnessing a miracle. 

12:01.411 --> 12:09.061
SiO, I must thank you 
for your help with my experiments. 

12:09.344 --> 12:17.031
With the completion of the ultimate essence 
we go beyond God itself. 

12:17.454 --> 12:20.671
The world will be us. 

12:25.484 --> 12:32.131
I will decide how this 
wonder to use, Professor Dharman. 

12:32.572 --> 12:37.733
And you help us. 
Remember that. 

12:39.550 --> 12:44.011
My apologies, 
SiO your highness. 

12:44.297 --> 12:48.755
This is just a great overlap of interests. 

12:48.755 --> 12:55.017
Be assured that I have everything 
commitment to serve h. .. 

12:55.017 --> 12:59.161
my noble and beautiful lady SiO. 

12:59.800 --> 13:01.549
Very wise of you. 

13:05.288 --> 13:09.591
The installation of the 
restructuring process is completed. 

13:13.097 --> 13:18.442
You three, keep in Afro 
the holes and keep me informed. 

13:18.693 --> 13:20.004
Understood. 

13:26.095 --> 13:29.824
The moment has finally arrived. 

13:30.155 --> 13:35.782
All preparations have been made 
our revenge on Afro Samurai. 

13:52.163 --> 13:54.241
You look a lot fresher from. 

13:54.241 --> 13:56.869
But the angry look 
is still not yet gone. 

13:56.869 --> 13:58.927
You know ... 

13:59.151 --> 14:03.095
the remains of your father 
steal during a storm ... 

14:06.039 --> 14:10.299
that is just scary. 
Completely lost and all. 

14:10.299 --> 14:13.833
Who does something well? 
But I know you. 

14:13.833 --> 14:17.298
You're so pissed 
you back on the road is ... 

14:17.298 --> 14:20.520
the Number Two headband 
again to find ... 

14:20.520 --> 14:24.306
so again against 
The number one can fight. 

14:30.180 --> 14:33.879
And all your father's 
skull to get? 

14:34.081 --> 14:39.032
I have no choice. 
My father should rest in peace. 

14:39.032 --> 14:41.255
Can we not 
Just ask for what it is? 

14:50.134 --> 14:53.309
Only the sword is now clean. 

14:53.309 --> 14:56.228
The rest is up to you. 

15:09.526 --> 15:12.053
Afro moves. 

15:12.780 --> 15:14.822
<i> Keep him in the eye. </ i> </i>

15:17.046 --> 15:19.985
We are not doing so. 

15:20.199 --> 15:22.522
Maybe you should just leave. 

15:22.522 --> 15:26.441
Maybe you better go find a hobby. 

15:27.532 --> 15:30.673
Wait a minute. 

15:31.165 --> 15:37.579
I realize that this is just me the first time 
I see you without headband. 

15:37.579 --> 15:41.645
You look a little weird out. 

15:42.021 --> 15:45.255
I knew that something was not right. 

15:45.255 --> 15:48.573
Your head is gigantic. 

15:48.573 --> 15:50.853
I knew you had a large head ... 

15:51.662 --> 15:54.563
but that is really a good forehead. 

15:54.563 --> 16:00.305
This is in the list 
Headquarters, main, main ... 

16:00.305 --> 16:01.707
Shut up. 

16:04.577 --> 16:05.950
Where are we going? 

16:17.177 --> 16:20.225
Is it true? 
Is he here? 

16:20.225 --> 16:25.021
He is. 
I forget those eyes and that's never. 

16:25.021 --> 16:29.663
The devil that Justice 
on Mount Shumi has slain. 

16:29.963 --> 16:33.456
The demon of our loved ones have been massacred. 

16:33.456 --> 16:38.776
We must exploit this opportunity. 
We will take revenge. 

16:39.152 --> 16:43.487
He is coming. 
Afro Samurai is coming. 

16:52.534 --> 16:54.187
This, you may need. 

17:06.510 --> 17:08.630
You killed my father. 

17:09.700 --> 17:12.943
You got him killed. 
-You 're my only brother slain. 

17:13.058 --> 17:16.925
And my best friend. 
-This is for my dead son. 

17:45.385 --> 17:48.974
Damn you, demon. 
You will burn in hell. 

17:49.223 --> 17:52.863
You will drown in the blood 
of the innocent that you've slain. 

17:53.124 --> 17:57.711
You will get our swords to suffer ... 

17:57.711 --> 17:59.602
even after our death. 

17:59.602 --> 18:03.126
Curse you, Afro Samurai. 

18:21.609 --> 18:24.227
It seems there are more. 

18:24.227 --> 18:26.646
Give me some money. 

18:53.015 --> 18:55.073
The Afro Samurai is here. 

18:56.516 --> 18:58.666
Send him, will you. 

18:59.615 --> 19:00.675
Here is the plan: 

19:00.675 --> 19:04.882
You undertake something 
and I get a lapdance. 

19:04.882 --> 19:06.739
Until about five minutes. 

19:07.720 --> 19:09.674
I am inside. 

19:33.459 --> 19:36.271
Oide Yasu. 
(Come in, unmoving) 

19:40.984 --> 19:44.240
The Number Two headband. 

19:44.998 --> 19:50.046
I'm afraid I'll 
can not say what that is ... 

19:50.046 --> 19:54.472
without payment. 
But if you know how to beat me ... 

19:56.387 --> 20:01.784
Not with the sword 
but with this one. 

20:02.294 --> 20:06.935
If you win I'll say 
where the number two. 

20:07.288 --> 20:11.444
If I win 
I get your head. 

20:12.422 --> 20:14.354
Are we agreed? 

20:15.213 --> 20:18.603
Bring Mr Afro 
to gokgedeelte. 

20:25.646 --> 20:28.039
Unlike you, a brother ... 

20:28.445 --> 20:32.095
I play only if I can win. 

20:36.966 --> 20:41.176
That was great. 

20:42.403 --> 20:45.697
I had a dance double, and ... 

20:46.226 --> 20:48.116
Did I miss something? 

20:51.046 --> 20:53.837
Are we gambling? 
Good. 

20:54.419 --> 20:56.820
Let us begin. 

20:57.498 --> 21:00.638
Set in black. 
Wrong game. 

21:06.382 --> 21:07.599
Say it. 

21:10.441 --> 21:11.625
Odd. 

21:12.984 --> 21:14.376
Even. 

21:16.742 --> 21:19.117
A double. 
Even. 

21:19.536 --> 21:24.853
Afro Samurai, 
now you've lost fair ... 

21:25.150 --> 21:28.166
I ask you promise to ... 

21:32.552 --> 21:33.923
Fair? 

21:39.119 --> 21:43.441
That cheating bastard. 
I want a lapdance for free. 

21:44.390 --> 21:48.088
The Number Two headband. 

21:49.006 --> 21:52.550
The Number Two is a ronin 
called Shichigoro. 

21:52.972 --> 21:56.577
He is in a village called 
Machi City in the west. 

22:01.035 --> 22:06.573
Had we not longer able to continue? 
This is boring. 

22:06.839 --> 22:08.368
You are boring. 

22:21.336 --> 22:25.618
The devil of revenge looking council. 

22:27.096 --> 22:30.939
You think your sins may be free ... 

22:30.939 --> 22:34.524
by stupid toys to carve? 

22:35.539 --> 22:38.307
One can also see that not every day. 

22:38.841 --> 22:42.535
Where is the cold-blooded killer 
you agree? 

22:43.309 --> 22:46.241
Do you have the guts not to fight? 

22:46.780 --> 22:48.561
Will you remain a coward? 

22:48.960 --> 22:51.218
Even if your father is suffering? 

22:51.592 --> 22:55.667
That is not nice. 
That you do not need to hear. 

22:56.241 --> 22:59.752
And you still have a long way to go ... 

23:00.220 --> 23:03.422
your poor, tormented father rescue. 

23:03.901 --> 23:06.461
I have his remains almost back to life. 

23:06.461 --> 23:08.365
He will live again. 

23:08.613 --> 23:10.257
In order to feel pain again. 

23:10.896 --> 23:12.398
To suffer. 

23:12.799 --> 23:16.270
And you have the Number Two headband yet. 

23:17.014 --> 23:21.275
So I have some days or even weeks ... 

23:21.275 --> 23:23.526
to your father's pain to enjoy ... 

23:23.526 --> 23:27.113
before you even have the right 
me over. 

23:28.033 --> 23:31.872
Watch your words. 

23:36.302 --> 23:38.785
Because I'll get my father. 

24:00.699 --> 24:03.088
And then we get you, bitch. 

24:03.538 --> 24:09.044
Finally you wake up, my dear. 

24:09.419 --> 24:12.573
Now the fun begins. 

24:14.521 --> 24:16.873
They do not know with whom 
they stick to it. 

24:27.783 --> 24:29.170
Jinno. 

24:30.153 --> 24:32.743
He is finally in motion. 

24:32.743 --> 24:34.677
Everything is proceeding according to plan. 

24:35.156 --> 24:36.829
We will get our revenge. 

24:37.799 --> 24:43.043
But to succeed 
We also evil path should pursue. 

24:44.121 --> 24:46.032
I am genuinely sorry. 

24:46.454 --> 24:51.400
But it is the only way 
to him the eternal sadness to feel ... 

24:51.760 --> 24:53.698
we have felt. 

24:53.996 --> 24:56.082
For him to suffer ... 

24:56.429 --> 24:58.691
as we have had. 

24:59.324 --> 25:00.842
So please ... 

25:01.862 --> 25:03.517
Forgive me. 

25:04.060 --> 25:05.756
Remember ... 

25:06.549 --> 25:09.363
that there is no alternative. 

25:11.176 --> 25:13.703
I will always love you ... 

25:15.189 --> 25:17.518
my beloved brother. 

25:39.100 --> 25:41.295
You have bad luck, man. 

25:41.296 --> 25:45.688
Everyone knows that this is the first day 
of the annual parade here. 

25:45.700 --> 25:49.967
Party animals who do not give you info 
your headband. 

25:50.215 --> 25:54.370
He called Shichigoro, right? 
Do you know how he looks? 

25:54.370 --> 25:58.532
Not me. How do we know 
or he is really hot? 

26:12.776 --> 26:14.501
On the side. 

26:14.501 --> 26:18.204
A kidnapping in broad daylight? 
Sad. 

26:19.762 --> 26:23.321
Damn. 
Afro Samurai. 

26:26.212 --> 26:27.956
On the side. 

26:28.172 --> 26:30.369
On the side, asshole. 

26:30.889 --> 26:34.487
Rifle, Afro. 
Take this guy to graze. 

27:02.236 --> 27:03.687
Kotaro. 

27:12.734 --> 27:14.383
Papa. 

27:19.553 --> 27:23.450
Kotaro, I told you to stay close. 

27:23.693 --> 27:25.412
Excuse me. 

27:29.462 --> 27:32.383
You have my thanks. 

27:32.769 --> 27:35.405
This coward had kidnapped my son to ... 

27:36.690 --> 27:38.338
Let even. 

27:42.480 --> 27:46.072
Can I get you something to drink? 
I know a place in the neighborhood. 

27:54.070 --> 27:56.004
I think I'm a ninja boots lost. 

27:56.004 --> 27:58.407
I am drowning. 

28:00.098 --> 28:02.173
Let your friend in the lurch. 

28:56.968 --> 28:59.183
I'm at home, old woman. 

29:01.843 --> 29:06.819
Have you brought a friend? 
-This man has saved Kotaro. 

29:07.599 --> 29:11.720
Maybe he is strong enough 
your stew to survive. 

29:13.022 --> 29:16.578
Only if you talk about my 
Oden, you Shichigoro. 

29:16.819 --> 29:19.157
Maybe you just a 
hot pepper in your bowl. 

29:19.656 --> 29:23.490
I'm back. 
I've missed you too. 

29:24.113 --> 29:25.925
Good to eat? 

29:26.904 --> 29:29.201
It smells pretty weird. 

29:30.472 --> 29:32.484
That's the guy. 

29:33.636 --> 29:36.074
What will it be, friend? 

29:37.493 --> 29:40.423
Sukiyaki. 
-Make that two of them. 

30:01.779 --> 30:03.665
To you. 

30:04.867 --> 30:08.798
No drinker? 
You do not know what you miss. 

30:09.540 --> 30:11.287
Lemonade, then? 

30:14.486 --> 30:18.853
Just kidding. 
You are here not for the festival, do you? 

30:19.739 --> 30:22.921
Me neither. 
Just passing through. 

30:24.837 --> 30:28.070
Apparently we are a little too long remained. 

30:29.719 --> 30:32.221
We have fun at the festival ... 

30:32.497 --> 30:35.413
but we better go. 

30:40.453 --> 30:46.347
Too bad that you should make him. 
He is not a bad guy. 

30:46.347 --> 30:49.479
It's always lonely after the festival. 

30:50.973 --> 30:55.028
Then I need at least 
you rat poison no longer eat. 

30:57.330 --> 30:58.702
You will still be sorry. 

30:58.702 --> 31:00.917
I make the best stew of the region. 

31:00.917 --> 31:03.883
Help me remember you next time 
twice as many to count. 

31:06.663 --> 31:08.518
Is this the best proposals? 

31:08.518 --> 31:12.021
Maybe you are Martha Stewart 
even killing those lies. 

31:12.427 --> 31:14.188
It tastes horrible. 

31:16.559 --> 31:20.313
Limonade. 
Help yourself. 

31:29.616 --> 31:33.433
The guy earlier 
you have slain ... 

31:33.792 --> 31:36.884
Want to know what he 
with Kotaro had? 

31:37.180 --> 31:41.563
Wil you know he was a street kid 
and one had drunk? 

31:43.545 --> 31:47.215
It is all right, old man. 
-Well, tell it. 

31:53.761 --> 31:57.147
I have something everyone wants. 

32:12.372 --> 32:16.522
One moment he is crammed full, 
Otherwise he sleeps. 

32:16.522 --> 32:19.661
He is not even mine. 
He is an orphan. 

32:19.661 --> 32:22.107
The son of a friend who was murdered. 

32:22.619 --> 32:24.249
I promised him to ... 

32:24.249 --> 32:26.521
when in trouble 
would lose power or was slain. 

32:27.400 --> 32:30.520
Me and the old master were like brothers. 

32:30.818 --> 32:33.892
I have heard 
that his murderer is strange looking. 

32:34.205 --> 32:38.935
An afro-hair with a green tint 
if you look closely. 

32:40.897 --> 32:44.408
Listen and listen good: 

32:45.033 --> 32:50.173
In this world there are links 
thicker than blood. 

32:54.642 --> 33:00.416
My crazy friend was just as others 
who wanted to have the headband. 

33:00.416 --> 33:02.546
It has cost him his life. 

33:03.681 --> 33:06.877
You know what he said 
when I found him dying? 

33:08.372 --> 33:12.085
'No more' 
he whispered. 

33:13.605 --> 33:18.066
So I got that headband itself 
caught him hidden. 

33:18.472 --> 33:20.796
Since then I'm on the run. 

33:32.333 --> 33:34.283
But now I have you. 

33:40.572 --> 33:42.675
And now we are even. 

33:44.298 --> 33:47.601
Let us get behind him. 

33:52.484 --> 33:56.820
Now it is. 
No more friendly Afro. 

34:00.200 --> 34:02.633
Keep your poison warm, old man. 

34:03.277 --> 34:05.138
I'm so again. 

34:21.996 --> 34:25.462
I thought if I Kotaro 
would go by ... 

34:25.554 --> 34:29.577
maybe we forget 
I wish my friend to us. 

34:29.577 --> 34:31.275
Peace for his son. 

34:32.471 --> 34:35.777
But apparently you can 
not escape the fate. 

34:36.327 --> 34:37.963
Damn. 

34:38.386 --> 34:42.360
The only thing that headbands 
precautions have been, and refused. 

34:43.406 --> 34:45.295
Can you hear me, Afro? 

34:45.500 --> 34:48.034
, And refused. 

34:50.342 --> 34:52.918
I give you the headband not. 

34:53.681 --> 34:56.164
You will have to kill me. 

34:56.715 --> 35:02.249
Not because I play under its rules, 
or to save the world ... 

35:08.064 --> 35:10.280
Why the formal attitude? 

35:10.483 --> 35:13.327
He is okay, 
but he is not your friend. 

35:13.327 --> 35:15.179
Get him off. 

35:21.107 --> 35:24.435
but because I love my promises. 

36:31.450 --> 36:35.062
Think not that I do not know, Afro Samurai. 

36:35.400 --> 36:38.045
I saw what you did on that bridge. 

36:38.455 --> 36:41.729
Killing without hesitation. 

36:42.414 --> 36:45.860
As if he did no more than one flight. 

36:47.008 --> 36:50.238
Maybe it's time 
someone makes you dead. 

36:51.318 --> 36:54.093
Maybe I have one. 

36:54.300 --> 36:58.317
Let you say? 
Cut him to pieces, Afro. 

37:04.546 --> 37:08.520
Say? Onara, 
Afro Samurai. 

37:09.038 --> 37:12.315
That's just crazy. 
You go out, fool. 

38:00.541 --> 38:02.381
That guy is fast. 

38:02.381 --> 38:06.043
I am impressed. 
Later he makes you outstanding. 

38:35.716 --> 38:37.110
Your flight? 

38:37.110 --> 38:39.885
You put us in front. 
Where are you going? 

38:52.594 --> 38:54.883
I knew you was smart. 

38:54.883 --> 38:59.240
We never flights, 
and that is not a change. 

38:59.240 --> 39:02.891
Do your thing, 
then I amuse me. 

39:02.891 --> 39:06.725
Time to celebrate. 

39:28.209 --> 39:32.699
Everyone loves rock. 
Time for a light show. 

40:00.769 --> 40:02.658
Put him on. 

40:37.521 --> 40:40.356
Focus your eyes on the pace. 

40:40.356 --> 40:44.365
On stage we have 
the man with the Number Two headband. 

41:14.000 --> 41:15.652
Where do they come from? 

41:26.171 --> 41:27.531
Dad? 

41:53.492 --> 41:56.689
You put the music stop. 

41:56.689 --> 41:59.408
Why ruin the party you always? 

42:04.000 --> 42:07.604
That was an unnecessary distraction. 

42:08.404 --> 42:10.401
Wil you still dead? 

42:16.859 --> 42:19.138
Would you like him so happy? 

42:19.138 --> 42:22.431
It is just a piece of dust, fool. 

42:26.145 --> 42:31.529
If you feel lucky to have 
get him out. 

44:03.085 --> 44:05.601
Sumanai. 
(Forgive me) 

44:46.735 --> 44:50.559
You always ruin the fun, right? 

44:50.559 --> 44:53.239
I wanted to celebrate until dawn. 

44:53.504 --> 44:57.029
With glow sticks and everything. 
Why you ruined it? 

44:57.236 --> 45:01.317
Next year they say it off. 
All because of you. 

45:01.317 --> 45:02.644
And another thing. 

45:02.896 --> 45:07.573
That you again Number Two are 
does not mean that you are so great. 

45:08.427 --> 45:12.921
Do you not? 
We walk back to the dark path. 

45:12.921 --> 45:14.640
This is not correct. 

45:21.571 --> 45:23.358
What now? 

45:23.358 --> 45:26.566
If we went out some goodies, 
if you know what I mean. 

45:26.566 --> 45:28.670
We never do anything. 

45:32.818 --> 45:34.864
What is it now? 

45:43.634 --> 45:45.701
If he can not already make? 

45:45.701 --> 45:47.478
Does he now? 

45:48.038 --> 45:51.746
Your sword stained with blood the world. 

45:52.136 --> 45:53.793
Would you believe? 

45:54.165 --> 45:57.612
You kill only your own 
trivial reasons. 

46:01.585 --> 46:03.561
Have you no heart? 

46:24.823 --> 46:28.176
That is not true. 
Who are those guys? 

46:28.176 --> 46:29.976
That is impossible. 

46:44.838 --> 46:46.927
I thought not. 

46:48.205 --> 46:53.789
Love you, 
or risk a beating. 

46:54.835 --> 46:58.484
You want my new toy does not spoil? 

46:59.150 --> 47:01.571
He is so fragile at the moment. 

47:02.837 --> 47:05.513
Go to the blossom hill 
if he dies again. 

47:05.730 --> 47:11.657
But this time 
much, much slower. 

47:13.898 --> 47:18.356
Watch your words. 

47:20.362 --> 47:21.872
Bin. 

47:22.559 --> 47:25.538
Lady. 
Reverse. 

47:45.694 --> 47:47.459
Are you okay? 

47:48.457 --> 47:50.380
No. 

48:09.399 --> 48:11.443
Jinno. 

48:18.520 --> 48:20.365
Calm down, sister. 

48:21.168 --> 48:23.730
Long ago, not true, 
SiO? 

48:23.994 --> 48:25.536
How are you, princess? 

48:26.276 --> 48:27.524
Well. 

48:27.524 --> 48:31.598
And with our foster parents? 
-Good. 

48:31.974 --> 48:33.670
They are like real parents. 

48:33.779 --> 48:37.371
And they have someone, Bin-san. 
He is quite strict and scary. 

48:37.371 --> 48:40.818
And the other, Michael-san, 
often plays with me. 

48:40.818 --> 48:45.462
And then you Tomoe-san. 
It teaches me to be a princess. 

48:45.696 --> 48:49.335
I even learn to dance, 
and tea and everything. 

48:52.009 --> 48:53.530
That is great. 

48:54.272 --> 48:57.028
I wish you could be here with me. 

48:57.249 --> 49:00.541
I know. 
But you are safe here. 

49:00.541 --> 49:04.395
This family wanted a daughter 
to replace their deceased daughter. 

49:04.641 --> 49:06.981
I see that you have included in the family. 

49:07.405 --> 49:09.122
We should both be grateful. 

49:09.465 --> 49:11.523
I will try 
more to come along, right? 

49:14.534 --> 49:17.775
I want you to meet somebody. 
This is Afro. 

49:17.775 --> 49:19.828
Afro, this is SiO, 
my sister. 

49:20.922 --> 49:22.856
Hi, Afro. 

49:24.349 --> 49:27.908
He is a newcomer to the sword school, 
but he is very good. 

49:28.155 --> 49:31.527
Almost as good as me. 
He is like a brother to me. 

49:33.361 --> 49:34.872
Brother? 

49:36.077 --> 49:39.956
So are you a bit my brother? 

49:40.521 --> 49:42.565
I think so. 

49:45.555 --> 49:46.885
Cool. 

49:47.241 --> 49:49.411
I have a brother in. 

49:50.095 --> 49:52.633
Can I look at the school look? 

49:53.915 --> 49:56.891
Sure. 
If you want to. 

49:56.891 --> 50:00.420
You are shy. 
And you love her. 

50:01.901 --> 50:03.787
Also nice to meet you. 

50:28.948 --> 50:31.330
You are about to Friday 

50:32.979 --> 50:37.225
You can not with technology 
play lady SiO. 

50:37.225 --> 50:39.062
Are you crazy? 

50:39.062 --> 50:44.197
He could be the ultimate samurai are 
when he is finished. 

50:44.197 --> 50:46.105
If growth is interrupted ... 

50:46.105 --> 50:50.268
he may just end up like a pat proteins. 

50:51.533 --> 50:57.873
Crazy? That is a strange word 
someone who is the picture of madness. 

50:57.873 --> 51:01.484
But our plans are ruined. 

51:01.484 --> 51:05.967
It is in the process, Professor. 

51:06.180 --> 51:09.939
The more I Afro challenge 
the better. 

51:09.939 --> 51:14.703
I want his long suffering and slow. 

51:15.033 --> 51:20.141
His death is not my purpose 
but the icing on the cake. 

51:20.141 --> 51:22.762
You know me yet? 

51:25.555 --> 51:30.175
Of course, SiO. 
You are absolutely cut. 

51:30.175 --> 51:33.727
But the risks ... 

51:37.844 --> 51:41.316
What a refreshing experience. 

51:41.316 --> 51:46.019
I put the cut in the most 
kooky professor in the world ... 

51:46.019 --> 51:48.279
cut with my health. 

51:49.885 --> 51:53.285
Fear not, my friend round. 

51:53.285 --> 51:57.685
Everything is great. 

51:58.016 --> 52:00.431
Have some confidence. 

52:02.629 --> 52:05.447
Yes, my lady. 

52:06.519 --> 52:09.529
Under my leadership, the 
not so wrong ... 

52:09.529 --> 52:12.268
if you failed masterpiece, 
Kuma. 

52:13.419 --> 52:14.943
Look at him now. 

52:14.943 --> 52:18.984
You got it so often already 
that nothing is more human. 

52:19.585 --> 52:22.637
He is but an empty shell. 

52:23.379 --> 52:27.091
Soulless, dead ... 

52:27.355 --> 52:28.994
But now ... 

52:28.994 --> 52:31.666
Muscles, bones ... 

52:31.988 --> 52:35.765
blood, bile, 
combined with nanotechnology. 

52:35.765 --> 52:38.260
Chemically programmed neuro-receptors ... 

52:38.260 --> 52:44.342
and things that are so taboo 
it is more alchemy than biotechnology. 

52:48.108 --> 52:54.558
You are truly the world's most 
disturbed, brilliant scientist. 

52:55.273 --> 52:59.761
You will burn in hell 
your violation of nature. 

53:00.077 --> 53:03.698
You praised me so beautiful lady SiO. 

53:04.021 --> 53:07.238
I am not worthy of your poetry. 

53:07.238 --> 53:13.193
Gear. History will regret your wrongdoing. 

53:13.301 --> 53:15.770
You would be burned alive. 

53:30.787 --> 53:36.089
Will call me and my brother 
follow the devastated city. 

53:36.308 --> 53:41.674
And upon arrival, he 
the consequences of his sins understand. 

53:41.864 --> 53:47.315
His twice killed friend 
and his beloved father ... 

53:47.315 --> 53:51.950
will him their vengeful swords spears. 

53:53.550 --> 54:01.926
And finally, these hands 
life away from the Afro Samurai. 

54:07.373 --> 54:10.879
It is hot here. 

54:10.879 --> 54:13.283
There is no shortcut 
to blossom hill? 

54:13.283 --> 54:17.777
And you know that SiO 
us in the late fall run? 

54:17.777 --> 54:21.185
And what a strange family reunion. 

54:22.588 --> 54:26.784
I bet that many of their 
dead father to again ... 

54:26.784 --> 54:32.728
but not only his head and viscera. 

54:33.029 --> 54:36.284
How can he still alive? 
Maybe he does not. 

54:36.549 --> 54:42.231
Maybe a robot, such as Afro-Droid 
you've already completed. 

54:42.231 --> 54:46.488
Or a doll with a hand in it. 

54:48.577 --> 54:52.025
Well, that was stupid. 
It is not pop. 

54:52.492 --> 54:56.658
But whatever it was, 
one thing is certain: 

54:56.923 --> 55:00.499
That bitch is crazy. 

55:00.499 --> 55:04.816
And what will you do to that kid that follows us? 

55:06.343 --> 55:10.847
You are dad murdered. 
Now, he finds you dead. 

55:11.207 --> 55:13.212
Sounds familiar, right? 

55:16.168 --> 55:20.051
No worries. 
He likes it not long off. 

55:20.051 --> 55:23.626
He follows us all the days heat. 

55:24.600 --> 55:26.710
In the morning he is dead. 

55:51.300 --> 55:54.148
Sorry, Dad. 

56:50.898 --> 56:54.121
I wish you had seen his face ... 

56:54.341 --> 56:58.800
when I showed him the head live 
of his deceased father. 

56:59.005 --> 57:04.510
Never forget that he was 
you so made. 

57:04.917 --> 57:08.534
He will go to hell 
for what he did. 

57:08.909 --> 57:15.899
We will be every second pain 
I enjoy his cause. 

57:16.172 --> 57:19.916
You will watch 
how the blood flows from his pores. 

57:19.916 --> 57:25.126
Listen to the sound of breaking bones. 

57:25.126 --> 57:29.843
His smell fear, 
and burning flesh. 

57:50.565 --> 57:55.196
His death will be met with fear ... 

57:55.508 --> 57:58.237
it is a legend in itself will be. 

57:58.237 --> 58:03.198
And I will be legendary executioner. 

58:42.982 --> 58:44.823
Mountain climbing? 

58:44.823 --> 58:47.334
How did you find me so 
able to convince? 

58:48.098 --> 58:49.971
I have no equipment. 

58:49.971 --> 58:52.093
I need a sports drink. 

58:52.312 --> 58:53.903
Got a rope? 

58:54.234 --> 58:56.646
Are we in the right direction? 

59:00.383 --> 59:04.178
The air is thin. 
I'm dead, man. 

59:04.178 --> 59:06.252
I get a stroke. 

59:06.252 --> 59:09.898
I'm crazy here. 
I have vertigo. 

59:28.964 --> 59:31.614
Is this the place? 

59:32.925 --> 59:36.504
This will be used have been great. 

59:36.807 --> 59:39.253
Just cut a park. 

59:39.253 --> 59:45.709
They had fixed pins and sugar cakes 
and rides. Everything. 

59:46.010 --> 59:48.033
But now there is nobody home. 

59:48.690 --> 59:52.561
What happened here? 
Too bad everything is broken. 

59:52.561 --> 59:54.853
Who did this? 

59:56.938 --> 01:00:01.169
Are you sure they are 
you would wait? 

01:00:01.417 --> 01:00:04.008
You need Justice. 

01:00:05.009 --> 01:00:08.209
You never asked for the road. 

01:00:49.477 --> 01:00:51.797
What have we here? 

01:00:52.364 --> 01:00:57.730
A disguised game? 
Welcome Committee? Cabaret Group? 

01:00:57.994 --> 01:01:03.346
Thank you, 
but we have an appointment. 

01:01:06.399 --> 01:01:08.067
See ... 

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:10.444
You with the mad face. 

01:01:10.444 --> 01:01:16.133
Did you find a crazy girl 
and a guy with a berenkop seen? 

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.886
That's no cigar. 

01:01:27.391 --> 01:01:29.472
I will die? 

01:01:34.513 --> 01:01:38.662
SiO Lady is not here. 

01:01:40.927 --> 01:01:45.918
You know us more, or, 
Afro Samurai? 

01:01:46.525 --> 01:01:50.282
Who had ever thought 
that the boy we knew ... 

01:01:50.282 --> 01:01:54.213
would return as a disturbed executioner ... 

01:01:54.213 --> 01:02:00.344
only driven by his rage 
around the world bringing death and destruction. 

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.513
Draw your sword, Afro Samurai. 

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.700
Now you will die. 

01:03:29.201 --> 01:03:33.880
What is wrong, my lady? 
Welcome you 

01:03:34.105 --> 01:03:38.724
The recovery of Afros father 
is in a critical phase. 

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:42.117
But this phase is listening very closely. 

01:03:42.117 --> 01:03:47.390
If an error creeping in 
we can still lose everything. 

01:03:49.273 --> 01:03:52.886
They are gone. 
-What do you say? 

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:58.030
They never do anything without orders from me. 
What have you done? 

01:03:58.213 --> 01:04:01.615
Maybe they made the village. 

01:04:03.152 --> 01:04:04.551
What do you mean? 

01:04:04.551 --> 01:04:10.684
Whether they have Afro Samurai 
challenged without you. 

01:04:10.996 --> 01:04:15.537
But fear not. 
Who knows they won it. 

01:04:17.049 --> 01:04:20.292
It may surprise you to hear ... 

01:04:20.292 --> 01:04:26.782
that there are quite a few features 
placed on their bodies ... 

01:04:26.782 --> 01:04:31.133
not to mention 
of an injection here and there. 

01:04:38.105 --> 01:04:43.299
Lady SiO, 
what are you doing now? 

01:04:53.715 --> 01:04:57.940
What have we here 
a hastily princess. 

01:04:58.345 --> 01:05:00.498
The recovery is still not ... 

01:05:03.447 --> 01:05:07.581
You have some beautiful work, 
Professor value. 

01:05:07.898 --> 01:05:15.554
All your plans, all the consequences. 
I offer my thanks. 

01:05:16.384 --> 01:05:22.106
Now is the time 
for all this work to take over. 

01:05:22.467 --> 01:05:25.777
Good night, professor. 

01:05:40.049 --> 01:05:44.313
The other executioner wakes soon. 

01:07:04.922 --> 01:07:10.744
What your goal is, 
some things we can not allow. 

01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:15.644
We may not be the path SiO 
of darkness to do. 

01:07:15.858 --> 01:07:22.628
Such a sweet lady. 
We do not allow them the grace falls. 

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:27.034
Instead, we are sinners. 

01:08:01.482 --> 01:08:05.593
I just wanted to Afro 
the village would see it destroyed. 

01:08:05.593 --> 01:08:10.744
I wanted to show him the consequences 
his throat before I need. 

01:08:10.744 --> 01:08:13.706
But now my vassals probably dead. 

01:08:15.533 --> 01:08:18.868
Fools car is 
where angels do not dare enter. 

01:09:03.365 --> 01:09:06.393
Michael, shoot him. 

01:09:09.323 --> 01:09:12.600
What are you waiting for? 
Do it. 

01:09:13.227 --> 01:09:17.691
Shoot them. 
She is already dead. 

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.736
Do it. 
For SiO lady. 

01:09:46.863 --> 01:09:48.969
Tomoe. 

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.099
I knew that sooner or later 
this day would come. 

01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:44.326
I will die with you. 

01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:19.233
Afro, you have it. 

01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:21.183
How did you survive? 

01:11:21.183 --> 01:11:23.715
What have I missed? 
I am affected by a sleep arrow. 

01:11:23.715 --> 01:11:26.675
Painful, but I am a hard, 
So no worries. 

01:11:26.675 --> 01:11:29.030
Do you joke ugly coats killed? 

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.779
Follow me, son. 

01:11:54.289 --> 01:11:57.669
Jesus Christ. 

01:11:58.968 --> 01:12:03.043
Now I have seen everything. 

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.757
Why are you always just in the fall? 

01:12:25.757 --> 01:12:27.818
Are you sometimes just stupid? 

01:12:28.242 --> 01:12:31.916
Here you crazy bitch 
which pulls the strings ... 

01:12:31.916 --> 01:12:36.065
and you resurrected robot friend 
that even though you may not. 

01:12:36.065 --> 01:12:41.267
And even a monster 
which you think your dad is. 

01:12:41.267 --> 01:12:44.228
That is my real father. 

01:12:47.515 --> 01:12:50.552
Wrong answer. 
You're an idiot. 

01:12:50.552 --> 01:12:53.674
And beyond this I will not. 

01:12:53.984 --> 01:12:56.126
Goodbye. 

01:13:02.304 --> 01:13:06.817
I come for my father, 
and the Number One headband. 

01:13:06.933 --> 01:13:08.736
What a surprise. 

01:13:09.124 --> 01:13:14.833
But what do you do 
with your body in such a condition? 

01:13:30.741 --> 01:13:32.644
We will torture you. 

01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:35.627
Death will be waiting. 

01:13:49.732 --> 01:13:53.540
Why did you 
the Number One headband not? 

01:13:54.341 --> 01:13:57.994
I wanted to avenge you. 

01:13:58.577 --> 01:14:00.529
What was your reason ... 

01:14:00.529 --> 01:14:05.599
we have the burden of destiny carry 
when he omdoet band. 

01:14:05.589 --> 01:14:07.991
That you would now need to know. 

01:14:08.241 --> 01:14:10.623
Is the Number One. 

01:14:10.903 --> 01:14:14.693
You can not escape the cycle of blood. 

01:14:18.732 --> 01:14:22.197
The Number One kill or be slain. 

01:14:22.446 --> 01:14:26.565
You do not have the luxury 
to decide whose blood you wasted. 

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:32.242
Take your headband back. 
Fear not, my son. 

01:14:34.913 --> 01:14:38.813
Father, wait. 

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:26.750
Look, my dear brother. 

01:15:28.592 --> 01:15:33.057
He will come to its end, 
exactly as I wanted. 

01:15:33.282 --> 01:15:35.733
By his own father. 

01:15:38.936 --> 01:15:42.011
He will finally pay for our suffering. 

01:15:42.011 --> 01:15:46.212
For the suffering of thousands of others like us. 

01:16:58.258 --> 01:16:59.804
Kill him. 

01:17:00.425 --> 01:17:03.156
Kill him once and for all. 

01:17:55.657 --> 01:17:59.994
Kill him, Afro. 
Kill him. That is your real father. 

01:17:59.994 --> 01:18:02.378
Kill him. 
Do it. 

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:07.474
I can not kill my father. 

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:11.250
Then this is the end. 

01:18:30.388 --> 01:18:34.136
Did you see that, Jinno? 
It is our success. 

01:18:34.136 --> 01:18:36.850
We finally got him to the court convened ... 

01:18:36.850 --> 01:18:40.783
and we were 
who have slain. 

01:18:41.885 --> 01:18:44.654
Look. 
Look, dear brother. 

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:21.663
What have you done? 

01:19:22.783 --> 01:19:26.340
What do you call Afro? 

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:36.799
Why protect him? 
He is dead. 

01:19:36.871 --> 01:19:39.044
It makes no sense. 

01:19:42.808 --> 01:19:45.833
Have you forgotten what he 
We did? 

01:19:45.833 --> 01:19:47.643
And you? 

01:20:23.526 --> 01:20:29.111
My dear brother. 

01:20:33.057 --> 01:20:38.964
I have the dojo 
protect the master sword. 

01:20:40.451 --> 01:20:43.737
I have to protect everyone. 

01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:50.410
Including my brother, Afro. 

01:21:56.300 --> 01:22:01.196
I love you, 
my Jinno. 

01:22:05.438 --> 01:22:08.122
My brother. 

01:22:23.025 --> 01:22:27.021
Long ago, not true, 
SiO? 

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:36.616
How are you, 
princess? 

01:23:58.834 --> 01:24:01.860
Flight, Afro. 
You can not win. 

01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:04.631
Ren then. 

01:24:04.904 --> 01:24:08.817
This win not. 
He is too strong. Inhumane. 

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:12.120
Do not. 

01:24:12.850 --> 01:24:17.017
Shut up. 

01:24:17.119 --> 01:24:19.616
It is so over. 

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:23.796
Forgive me, 
but you're not my father. 

01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:29.296
My father died long ago. 

01:24:34.068 --> 01:24:36.802
Fear not. 

01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:23.580
Father ... 

01:26:05.728 --> 01:26:08.785
When you're done. 

01:26:23.850 --> 01:26:29.669
Your gaze to see 
you have a heavy day. 

01:26:30.088 --> 01:26:34.534
You knew that it never ceases 
Once it is started. 

01:26:36.330 --> 01:26:38.036
But was that you? 

01:26:38.314 --> 01:26:40.641
It is the only choice 
you've ever had. 

01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:18.707
I have long waited for you. 

01:27:21.090 --> 01:27:26.189
