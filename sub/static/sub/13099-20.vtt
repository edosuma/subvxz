00:02.667 --> 00:05.417
[instrumental music]

00:17.500 --> 00:19.125
Ah, Londo.

00:21.125 --> 00:22.250
Good to see you again.

00:22.333 --> 00:25.500
And you, Refa. You look well.

00:25.583 --> 00:27.208
Exciting times, Mollari.

00:27.292 --> 00:31.083
They fire the blood
and the mind.

00:31.167 --> 00:32.333
Leave us.

00:34.667 --> 00:38.000
Refa...the emperor?

00:38.083 --> 00:40.292
Is out among his people

00:40.375 --> 00:44.500
basking in their
almost-sincere adulation.

00:44.583 --> 00:47.917
He has left things here
in the hands of his court

00:48.000 --> 00:51.125
which can function just
as well without him as with him.

00:51.208 --> 00:52.583
Sometimes better.

00:52.667 --> 00:54.625
A point that I'm sure
has not been lost on him.

00:54.708 --> 00:59.458
I will only say he appreciates
his position and ours.

00:59.542 --> 01:00.833
And yours.

01:00.917 --> 01:03.417
You have been much
in our thoughts lately.

01:03.500 --> 01:06.958
'We know this has been a hard
time for you. Our work here--'

01:07.042 --> 01:10.458
Has cost me the life
of one friend already.

01:10.542 --> 01:12.458
How many more
do you have lined up? Hmm?

01:12.542 --> 01:16.958
What has happened in the past
is unfortunate, Londo.

01:17.042 --> 01:18.333
But for the sake of our people

01:18.417 --> 01:20.792
we must learn from
our mistakes and move on.

01:20.875 --> 01:24.458
Lord Refa,
I have come a long way

01:24.542 --> 01:26.333
and I am tired.

01:26.417 --> 01:29.083
Is there a reason
I have been summoned here, now?

01:29.167 --> 01:33.333
Indeed there is.
I have good news.

01:33.417 --> 01:37.667
The war which began
six months ago is about to end

01:37.750 --> 01:40.542
sooner than any of us
could have hoped.

01:40.625 --> 01:43.167
'And you, Londo Mollari'

01:43.250 --> 01:45.833
'will be the architect
of our victory.'

01:47.000 --> 01:49.833
[instrumental music]

02:16.833 --> 02:18.833
Hello, dear friend.

02:18.917 --> 02:21.000
[man laughing]

02:22.917 --> 02:24.750
- That's funny.
- What?

02:24.833 --> 02:27.625
I'm picking up an energy
surge from the planet below.

02:27.708 --> 02:29.208
- You sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

02:29.292 --> 02:30.667
Take a look for yourself.

02:32.292 --> 02:33.458
Commander was afraid
something like this

02:33.542 --> 02:34.708
might happen again
one of these days.

02:34.792 --> 02:35.833
Something like what?

02:35.917 --> 02:37.458
Station 3 to Commander Ivanova.

02:37.542 --> 02:40.333
[water running]

02:44.000 --> 02:46.833
[instrumental music]

02:56.333 --> 02:58.333
[device beeping]

03:00.208 --> 03:01.500
Yes?

03:01.583 --> 03:03.250
Captain, I just
wanted to let you know

03:03.333 --> 03:05.708
we're picking up some unusual
signals from the planet below.

03:07.458 --> 03:09.083
Ivanova?

03:09.167 --> 03:12.083
- Ivanova?
- 'Hello, captain.'

03:12.167 --> 03:15.542
I do hope
I'm not inconveniencing you

03:15.625 --> 03:18.125
but I think we should talk.

03:21.667 --> 03:27.083
(male narrator)
The Babylon Project was our
last, best hope for peace.

03:27.167 --> 03:29.917
A self-contained world,
five miles long

03:30.000 --> 03:32.208
located in neutral territory.

03:35.708 --> 03:37.792
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

03:37.875 --> 03:41.458
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

03:41.542 --> 03:44.583
A shining beacon in space

03:44.667 --> 03:46.917
all alone in the night.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.292
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind.

03:50.375 --> 03:54.667
The year the Great War
came upon us all.

03:54.750 --> 03:58.583
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.958
The year is 2259.

04:01.042 --> 04:02.333
The name of the place

04:02.417 --> 04:04.083
is Babylon 5.

04:04.167 --> 04:07.208
[theme music]

04:33.417 --> 04:36.208
[music continues]

04:51.625 --> 04:54.375
I've been watching you
for quite some time, captain.

04:54.458 --> 04:58.375
And I thought it was time
that I introduced myself.

04:58.458 --> 05:02.375
My name...is Draal.

05:02.458 --> 05:04.333
How do you do?

05:04.417 --> 05:06.083
I-I'm fine. Fine.

05:06.167 --> 05:08.292
Good.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.667
You don't have any idea
who I am, do you?

05:11.750 --> 05:13.417
Unless there's another
Draal who could do

05:13.500 --> 05:15.542
what you just did
you're the Minbari

05:15.625 --> 05:18.042
who took custody
of the planet we're orbiting.

05:18.125 --> 05:21.333
Ah, captain, you do not
take custody of a planet.

05:21.417 --> 05:24.375
The planet takes custody of you.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.333
It chose me...when the one who

05:27.417 --> 05:31.667
lived in the heart
of the machine lay dying.

05:31.750 --> 05:36.750
Since then, it has nourished me,
returned to me my youth

05:36.833 --> 05:40.583
and appearance of 30 years ago.

05:40.667 --> 05:43.542
I am but a steward, a guardian

05:43.625 --> 05:49.167
here for a short while
and then gone, a humble..

05:49.250 --> 05:51.250
I can come back after
you've finished dressing.

05:51.333 --> 05:52.583
No, no, it's fine.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.792
I wouldn't wish to be
an inconvenience.

05:54.875 --> 05:56.042
You're not. I've been--

05:56.125 --> 05:58.083
A humble guardian of the great

05:58.167 --> 06:00.083
and terrible secrets

06:00.167 --> 06:04.125
that have been entrusted
to my care.

06:04.208 --> 06:05.875
You were saying?

06:05.958 --> 06:10.042
I've been wondering...
if you'd ever make contact.

06:10.125 --> 06:13.208
I've read the reports
about what happened and

06:13.292 --> 06:15.583
after a while I began to wonder
if you were real or not.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.958
Quite real, captain.

06:18.042 --> 06:20.875
I'm here to invite you
down for a visit.

06:20.958 --> 06:22.458
A visit?

06:23.542 --> 06:25.125
Well, y-yes, if..

06:25.208 --> 06:27.292
I suppose. When?

06:27.375 --> 06:30.042
Whenever is most
convenient for you.

06:30.125 --> 06:32.458
And whenever is most
convenient for you

06:32.542 --> 06:35.625
is as soon as possible,
trust me.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.750
Ah, wait. Uh..

06:38.833 --> 06:41.792
What about your planet's
defenses? How do I contact you?

06:41.875 --> 06:44.292
Details, details.

06:44.375 --> 06:47.750
Oh, and you can bring one other.
You'll know who.

06:52.167 --> 06:55.417
(G'Sten)
'The war does not
go well for us, G'Kar.'

06:55.500 --> 06:59.167
Our outposts and colonies
at Shi, Dross and Zok

06:59.250 --> 07:01.167
have all been conquered.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.792
In the last seven days
we have lost

07:02.875 --> 07:05.708
all contact with our
holdings in that sector.

07:05.792 --> 07:09.292
So, we must assume
that they have fallen as well.

07:09.375 --> 07:10.917
G'Quan..

07:11.000 --> 07:13.167
The Centauri have pushed us back

07:13.250 --> 07:14.500
further than we have ever been

07:14.583 --> 07:16.167
for 30 years.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.000
Their forces
are closing in on us

07:18.083 --> 07:19.167
in every direction.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.375
War leader G'Sten,
I don't understand.

07:21.458 --> 07:24.042
I'd heard none of this
during my weekly briefings.

07:24.125 --> 07:27.625
The Kha'Ri is trying
to perpetuate the belief

07:27.708 --> 07:31.792
that we are holding our own.
We're not.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.750
Then there is no hope.

07:33.833 --> 07:35.875
There's always hope.

07:35.958 --> 07:37.042
[chuckles]

07:37.125 --> 07:38.792
At least
that's what I tell myself

07:38.875 --> 07:41.750
when I awaken in the middle
of the night and the only sound

07:41.833 --> 07:45.708
I can hear is the beating
of my own desperate heart.

07:46.875 --> 07:48.833
We have one chance.

07:51.625 --> 07:56.375
We have located the supply world
for the Centauri main force.

07:56.458 --> 07:59.542
Here, at Gorash 7.

07:59.625 --> 08:01.833
It's heavily guarded
but open to attack

08:01.917 --> 08:06.792
if we commit the bulk of our
forces for one all-out strike.

08:06.875 --> 08:08.583
'Many of our ships
will not return'

08:08.667 --> 08:13.458
but if we strike hard enough,
we can cut their supply line.

08:13.542 --> 08:15.500
'An attack like this
should make them think'

08:15.583 --> 08:17.750
'that we are
launching a new offensive'

08:17.833 --> 08:21.458
that perhaps they have
underestimated our forces.

08:21.542 --> 08:25.250
Their entire campaign
has been cautious.

08:25.333 --> 08:28.417
This should make them pull back

08:28.500 --> 08:29.958
and re-examine their strategy.

08:30.042 --> 08:31.875
And with luck,
this will buy us time

08:31.958 --> 08:33.583
to bolster our lines of defense.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.917
Exactly. If we make them pay

08:36.000 --> 08:38.583
for every inch of space

08:38.667 --> 08:42.167
we can wear them down,
prolonging the war

08:42.250 --> 08:45.000
beyond their capacity
to fight it.

08:46.292 --> 08:49.083
The Centauri
want a quick victory.

08:49.167 --> 08:51.958
They don't have the stomach
for prolonging the war.

08:52.042 --> 08:54.542
There is a danger, G'Sten.

08:54.625 --> 08:56.417
Drawing off our forces
like this will leave

08:56.500 --> 08:58.792
Homeworld with only
a skeleton defense.

08:58.875 --> 09:01.583
I know, but if we go on
fighting the way we have been

09:01.667 --> 09:03.750
sooner or later
Homeworld will fall.

09:03.833 --> 09:06.625
We must change
our strategy quickly.

09:06.708 --> 09:10.292
Even in our worst projections,
we will always have enough

09:10.375 --> 09:14.042
surviving ships
to effectively defend Homeworld.

09:14.125 --> 09:15.792
They will only be gone
for a little while.

09:15.875 --> 09:18.958
The window of vulnerability

09:19.042 --> 09:20.708
is very small.

09:20.792 --> 09:23.417
I pray you're right, G'Sten.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.583
I wish I were going with you.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.167
Your place is here, G'Kar.

09:30.250 --> 09:31.875
We will need alliances

09:31.958 --> 09:34.917
support...even sympathy.

09:36.250 --> 09:39.042
In the final analysis,
your work here could be

09:39.125 --> 09:42.708
more important
than a fleet of ships.

09:42.792 --> 09:45.167
But how could I go off
without saying goodbye

09:45.250 --> 09:48.500
to my favorite nephew?

09:48.583 --> 09:53.250
Your father would be
very proud of you, G'Kar.

09:56.625 --> 09:57.917
Be well.

09:59.875 --> 10:02.250
And you, G'Sten.

10:03.583 --> 10:06.417
[instrumental music]

10:15.125 --> 10:16.958
Captain, here you are.
I was looking for you.

10:17.042 --> 10:18.750
Uh, this isn't
a good time, ambassador.

10:18.833 --> 10:20.583
- I'm in kind of a hurry.
- I know.

10:20.667 --> 10:23.125
He appeared to me as well.

10:23.208 --> 10:24.375
Well, perhaps we should continue

10:24.458 --> 10:26.542
if you are in
such a terrible hurry.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.542
Perhaps we should.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.750
You are sure that your
information is correct, hm?

10:31.833 --> 10:32.833
Of course.

10:32.917 --> 10:34.792
We intercepted
a coded transmission

10:34.875 --> 10:38.542
from the Narn Strategic Command.
One of their flagships.

10:38.625 --> 10:41.458
They intend to strike
at Gorash 7.

10:41.542 --> 10:42.875
It could be misinformation.

10:42.958 --> 10:45.250
An attempt to draw off
our main force

10:45.333 --> 10:46.583
while they strike elsewhere.

10:46.667 --> 10:49.375
Yes, I have heard this
from others in the Centaurum

10:49.458 --> 10:51.583
but I don't think so.

10:51.667 --> 10:56.542
It has just the right ring
of desperation to be true.

10:56.625 --> 10:58.542
Took some doing
but I managed to convince

10:58.625 --> 11:01.375
some of our generals
that the message is genuine.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.250
Enough for what is necessary.

11:03.333 --> 11:06.250
Then you're going to be waiting
for them at Gorash 7, yes?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.583
- No.
- What?

11:08.667 --> 11:10.625
Are you mad?

11:10.708 --> 11:12.292
They will destroy
our supply lines.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.667
Not if your forces
are there waiting for them.

11:14.750 --> 11:16.250
My forces?

11:16.333 --> 11:18.583
And where will all your generals
be during this? Hm?

11:18.667 --> 11:20.583
Launching a full assault

11:20.667 --> 11:23.208
on the Narn Homeworld itself.

11:26.583 --> 11:27.917
Great Maker!

11:28.000 --> 11:30.625
- You can't be serious.
- Of course, I'm serious.

11:30.708 --> 11:34.250
Refa, any force
attempting to invade Narn

11:34.333 --> 11:37.167
would be up to its neck
in blood. Its own.

11:37.250 --> 11:39.708
We have no intention
of invading Narn.

11:39.792 --> 11:43.042
Flattening it, yes.
But invading it?

11:43.125 --> 11:45.167
'We will be using mass drivers.'

11:45.250 --> 11:47.625
By the time we are done,
their cities will be in ruins.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.417
We can move in
at our leisure.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.917
Mass drivers?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.750
They have been outlawed
by every civilized planet.

11:53.833 --> 11:55.792
These are uncivilized times.

11:55.875 --> 11:59.292
- We have treaties.
- Ink on a page!

11:59.375 --> 12:03.125
'This one move will end the war
in days instead of months'

12:03.208 --> 12:05.542
and save thousands
of Centauri lives.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.833
We only require your assistance
and that of your allies.

12:08.917 --> 12:10.208
Listen to me, Refa.

12:10.292 --> 12:12.792
My allies
have begun to worry me.

12:12.875 --> 12:15.792
Reports I have received.
Their sheer strength..

12:15.875 --> 12:19.417
Yes, they are very powerful,
which is what we need.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.833
I don't understand
your reluctance, Londo.

12:21.917 --> 12:23.833
reluctant.

12:23.917 --> 12:26.583
I just feel that
things are moving too quickly.

12:26.667 --> 12:28.875
They threaten
to spin out of control.

12:28.958 --> 12:31.542
Nonsense. We know
exactly what we're doing

12:31.625 --> 12:34.375
and now is not the time
for doubts, Mollari.

12:34.458 --> 12:36.000
'We are here because of you.'

12:36.083 --> 12:39.417
'It's a little late
to back out now.'

12:39.500 --> 12:43.250
Londo, everything depends
on your cooperation.

12:43.333 --> 12:46.917
At this very moment, a dozen
of our largest battle cruisers

12:47.000 --> 12:48.667
are standing by in hyperspace

12:48.750 --> 12:50.958
waiting for your decision.

12:51.042 --> 12:54.667
'If you wish to serve our
people, how better to do so'

12:54.750 --> 12:57.292
'than to end this war quickly.'

12:57.375 --> 12:58.708
Gloriously!

12:58.792 --> 13:01.417
With a minimum
of Centauri blood.

13:03.542 --> 13:04.792
Alright.

13:04.875 --> 13:06.833
I will bring
my associates into this

13:06.917 --> 13:09.625
the last time!

13:09.708 --> 13:11.292
We are Centauri.

13:11.375 --> 13:15.875
If we are to seize our destiny,
we must do it ourselves.

13:15.958 --> 13:18.292
After this, no more.

13:18.375 --> 13:20.792
After this,
there will no longer be a need.

13:20.875 --> 13:23.500
- Huh.
- Thank you, Londo.

13:25.333 --> 13:26.500
Cheer up.

13:26.583 --> 13:28.375
By the time
you return to Babylon 5

13:28.458 --> 13:32.375
the war will be over and
the Narns will be at our feet.

13:32.458 --> 13:35.667
And this time,
we will keep them there.

13:43.500 --> 13:44.875
We still have to be sure
this message

13:44.958 --> 13:46.042
what it appears to be.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.208
Of course it is.

13:47.292 --> 13:48.458
Do you think
I would not recognize

13:48.542 --> 13:49.833
my old teacher?

13:49.917 --> 13:51.958
To be fair, Delenn,
he didn't exactly look the same

13:52.042 --> 13:53.542
as he does
in the station records.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.958
No. He looks stronger, more fit

13:56.042 --> 13:57.833
just as he did
when he was my mentor.

13:57.917 --> 13:59.042
But there's always the chance
that someone might

13:59.125 --> 14:00.208
send a bogus message.

14:00.292 --> 14:01.458
But why?

14:01.542 --> 14:02.583
Well, how about
to get the both of you

14:02.667 --> 14:03.917
in a ship headed for the planet

14:04.000 --> 14:05.583
which, if we remember
our last warning

14:05.667 --> 14:07.250
would end up with you
being shot down, lasered

14:07.333 --> 14:09.417
or otherwise scattered
all over the landscape.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.625
Draal would never do that.
I know him too well.

14:12.708 --> 14:14.417
(Michael)
Yeah, well, that was before
he went into that machine

14:14.500 --> 14:16.250
running the planet.
Who knows what he's like now?

14:16.333 --> 14:18.083
And that's assuming he's
the one who sent the message

14:18.167 --> 14:20.250
in the first place.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.542
Captain, we just finished
our scan of Epsilon 3.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.292
The message came from three
miles inside the planet's

14:24.375 --> 14:26.167
surface. It's genuine alright.

14:27.708 --> 14:29.875
Well, that settles it then.

14:29.958 --> 14:33.250
He's made the invitation, and
I don't see how I can say no.

14:33.333 --> 14:35.250
I mean, we're next-door
neighbors, and he's right

14:35.333 --> 14:36.958
it's about time
we got to know each other.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.750
I'd feel a lot more comfortable
at this situation

14:38.833 --> 14:40.583
if you'd let me send
a security team with you.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.958
He told me I could
only bring one other..

14:43.042 --> 14:46.542
...and that I would know
who he was referring to.

14:46.625 --> 14:49.708
I'm ready to depart
whenever you are, captain.

14:51.583 --> 14:55.292
Ah, Mollari, I was
just about to send for you.

14:55.375 --> 14:56.750
Go ahead, gentlemen.

14:59.375 --> 15:01.792
- It's time to go.
- Go? Where?

15:01.875 --> 15:03.583
'To the Narn Homeworld,
of course.'

15:03.667 --> 15:05.792
I've reserved a place for us
aboard the Valerius.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.792
It leaves within the hour.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.708
'We will be at the head
of the fleet'

15:09.792 --> 15:12.542
to personally oversee
our victory.

15:16.208 --> 15:20.250
Come, Londo. Destiny awaits.

15:22.250 --> 15:24.250
[instrumental music]

15:24.333 --> 15:26.167
(John)
'Beginning atmospheric
insertion.'

15:26.250 --> 15:28.542
Confirmed, Shuttle 1,
you're clear for de-orbit.

15:28.625 --> 15:31.333
(John)
'Thanks, C and C.
Be back in a few hours.'

15:35.250 --> 15:37.542
[indistinct chattering]

15:51.917 --> 15:54.667
- You wanted to see me, doctor?
- Yes.

15:54.750 --> 15:57.083
Excuse me. Can you help?

15:58.125 --> 15:59.333
Thank you.

16:00.875 --> 16:03.708
We had another group of refugees
come in from the front lines

16:03.792 --> 16:06.375
this morning
from your colony on Dross.

16:06.458 --> 16:08.958
Agricultural specialists.
Civilians.

16:09.042 --> 16:11.500
A few soldiers. The usual mix.

16:11.583 --> 16:13.625
Are they...alright?

16:15.417 --> 16:16.583
Mostly.

16:18.042 --> 16:21.250
There's something that
I thought you should know.

16:21.333 --> 16:24.250
One of the refugees said that
he was captured and interrogated

16:24.333 --> 16:26.833
by the Centauri and they
kept asking the same questions

16:26.917 --> 16:28.375
over and over again.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.042
Seems that they wanted to know
as much as possible

16:30.125 --> 16:32.375
about your Homeworld's
defense system.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.125
I'm not surprised.

16:34.208 --> 16:35.542
Eventually,
they will have to turn

16:35.625 --> 16:38.042
their eye toward Narn itself.

16:38.125 --> 16:39.792
Yeah, that's just it.

16:39.875 --> 16:43.250
He said their questions seemed
unusually urgent.

16:43.333 --> 16:44.625
And one more thing.

16:44.708 --> 16:46.583
The only reason
that this batch of refugees

16:46.667 --> 16:49.250
got out is because
the Centauri warships pulled out

16:49.333 --> 16:51.458
before they finished
securing the planet.

16:51.542 --> 16:54.458
Centauri don't work that way.
They're very thorough.

16:54.542 --> 16:56.667
I know.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.250
In the final days
of our last war

16:59.333 --> 17:02.500
the Minbari bypassed
several of our colonies.

17:02.583 --> 17:06.000
They went right past
our colonies on Mars and Io

17:06.083 --> 17:08.708
because they were ready
to hit Earth itself.

17:10.833 --> 17:13.792
I would like to speak
with this Narn.

17:13.875 --> 17:16.083
I'm afraid that's not possible.

17:19.542 --> 17:21.417
I don't want to panic
anyone, ambassador

17:21.500 --> 17:23.625
but I thought you should know.

17:23.708 --> 17:25.875
Yes.

17:25.958 --> 17:27.375
Thank you, doctor.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.708
[instrumental music]

17:45.333 --> 17:47.542
(John)
'You're sure you know
where you're going?'

17:47.625 --> 17:50.958
Of course.
I have an excellent memory.

17:51.042 --> 17:52.292
You're positive?

17:52.375 --> 17:55.833
Abso-fragging-lutely, damn it.

17:55.917 --> 17:57.708
Since our last discussion
I have been studying

17:57.792 --> 18:01.042
your use of language.
Uh, do you approve?

18:01.125 --> 18:04.083
Well, we'll talk
about that later.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.500
Uh, left or right?

18:06.583 --> 18:08.750
Left. I believe.

18:18.250 --> 18:19.875
Good Lord.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.333
I may not go home.

18:30.125 --> 18:32.875
G'Kar, this is hardly
enough information.

18:32.958 --> 18:35.250
You know the Centauri!
You know how they operate!

18:35.333 --> 18:36.917
Attack, neutralize, secure

18:37.000 --> 18:39.083
move on
to the next target.

18:39.167 --> 18:40.625
Why would they
withdraw from Dross

18:40.708 --> 18:42.208
before finishing the job?

18:42.292 --> 18:45.667
I don't know. Perhaps they
encountered heavy resistance.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.292
Well, they might regroup,
but they wouldn't leave.

18:48.375 --> 18:49.833
G'Sten, listen to me.

18:49.917 --> 18:52.417
If there's even a chance
they mean to attack Homeworld..

18:52.500 --> 18:55.042
The mission is too far along
to stop it without proof.

18:55.125 --> 18:57.375
- With a little more time, I..
- 'There's no time.'

18:57.458 --> 18:59.333
- We're about to launch.
- G'Sten!

18:59.417 --> 19:02.542
I'm sorry, G'Kar. I have to go.

19:02.625 --> 19:05.292
I'll finish this conversation
when I return.

19:15.292 --> 19:17.500
Draal?

19:17.583 --> 19:18.917
We're here.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.625
Did you think I hadn't noticed,
my old friend?

19:26.875 --> 19:28.708
You've changed.

19:30.167 --> 19:32.500
I like it.

19:32.583 --> 19:36.500
Captain, I have watched you
since your arrival.

19:36.583 --> 19:39.750
At first,
I wasn't sure about you.

19:39.833 --> 19:41.750
But your decisions
have been wise

19:41.833 --> 19:46.250
your attitudes commendable and
your patience vaster than mine

19:46.333 --> 19:49.167
would have been
under similar circumstances.

19:49.250 --> 19:52.417
- Thank you.
- I'm not finished yet.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.583
Oh, sorry.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.083
Since taking up residence

19:55.167 --> 19:57.250
in the heart of this machine

19:57.333 --> 20:01.167
I have explored its secrets,
learned and discovered

20:01.250 --> 20:04.417
that I can look
into distant worlds.

20:04.500 --> 20:08.875
See and hear things you
cannot begin to imagine.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.083
Along the way..

20:12.167 --> 20:15.042
...I've learned some things
captain.

20:16.708 --> 20:19.333
The loss of your wife.

20:21.125 --> 20:25.542
'I know Delenn has told you
about the coming darkness.'

20:25.625 --> 20:29.583
And lately I've learned
about your role in

20:29.667 --> 20:33.583
shall we say,
a conspiracy of light

20:33.667 --> 20:35.667
aimed at your own government?

20:36.875 --> 20:38.208
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:38.292 --> 20:41.958
Yes, you do.
Please, captain, don't worry.

20:42.042 --> 20:44.458
Your secret is safe with me.

20:44.542 --> 20:46.000
They would have to dig down

20:46.083 --> 20:49.250
three miles into the surface
of this planet to learn

20:49.333 --> 20:51.750
what I know and no one who tried

20:51.833 --> 20:54.167
would survive the attempt.

20:56.833 --> 20:59.417
'And now I have seen enough.'

20:59.500 --> 21:01.125
I said a year ago
that this place

21:01.208 --> 21:05.042
was to be left alone
until the time was right.

21:05.125 --> 21:07.208
That time has arrived.

21:08.917 --> 21:11.625
Now that I know the full
capabilities of this place

21:11.708 --> 21:15.917
I am prepared to place them
at your disposal.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.833
Are you proposing an alliance?

21:17.917 --> 21:19.833
One of the first.

21:19.917 --> 21:21.833
There will be more to come.

21:23.667 --> 21:27.875
This has been a hard and trying
year for you, Captain Sheridan.

21:27.958 --> 21:31.625
'It might be helpful for you
to know that you are not alone.'

21:32.875 --> 21:36.083
And that in the long,
twilight struggle

21:36.167 --> 21:38.375
which lies ahead of us..

21:38.458 --> 21:42.250
...there is
the possibility of hope.

21:43.083 --> 21:45.875
[intense music]

22:13.292 --> 22:16.125
[music continues]

22:21.833 --> 22:25.875
Warleader G'Sten to fleet ships.
Stand by to attack.

22:25.958 --> 22:28.083
- Status?
- No enemy ships detected.

22:28.167 --> 22:30.875
We're.. Just a minute.
I'm picking up a disturbance.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.125
Picking up four, possibly five
ships, unknown configuration.

22:39.208 --> 22:40.708
Moving toward us
on attack vector.

22:40.792 --> 22:42.333
Can we initiate jump?

22:42.417 --> 22:44.250
Not until the jump engines
can recharge.

22:44.333 --> 22:45.500
Then we have no choice.

22:45.583 --> 22:48.250
Alert all ships.
Prepare to attack.

22:48.333 --> 22:51.167
[music continues]

22:53.708 --> 22:56.417
[intense music]

22:57.583 --> 22:59.333
Fire energy mines!

23:23.833 --> 23:26.625
[music continues]

23:30.125 --> 23:32.208
[indistinct chanting]

23:45.208 --> 23:47.625
[indistinct chanting]

23:53.583 --> 23:56.375
[music continues]

23:57.375 --> 23:59.333
[indistinct chanting]

24:12.000 --> 24:13.167
[alarm blaring]

24:13.250 --> 24:15.708
A direct hit.
Damage to all sectors.

24:15.792 --> 24:18.500
How much longer
until we can jump?

24:18.583 --> 24:19.750
Jump engines on line.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.750
Get us out of here.
Alert the fleet.

24:21.833 --> 24:23.875
We must escape while we can.

24:23.958 --> 24:25.208
Initiating jump point.

24:25.292 --> 24:28.375
[music continues]

24:43.042 --> 24:45.792
Jump points falling apart.
Energy fields collapsing.

24:45.875 --> 24:48.167
Pull back! Pull back!

24:48.250 --> 24:49.875
It's too late!

24:55.500 --> 24:58.333
[music continues]

25:25.333 --> 25:28.375
[instrumental music]

25:45.167 --> 25:47.417
(Draal)
'Needless to say
I think it would be unwise'

25:47.500 --> 25:51.042
to inform your
government of our alliance.

25:51.125 --> 25:53.208
I'm inclined to agree.

25:53.292 --> 25:55.917
Is it difficult
to be alone here, Draal?

25:56.000 --> 25:57.792
I'm never alone.

25:57.875 --> 26:00.542
My thoughts
are always among the stars.

26:00.625 --> 26:03.417
And I've heard that there are
a few others living here

26:03.500 --> 26:05.958
who maintain the great machine,
I speak with them

26:06.042 --> 26:10.083
from time to time,
they're quite interesting.

26:10.167 --> 26:14.458
There is one
in particular who.. Oh.

26:14.542 --> 26:17.208
Draal, are you alright?

26:17.292 --> 26:20.458
I am picking up
distress calls. I'm..

26:22.000 --> 26:23.500
- In Valen's name..
- What is it?

26:23.583 --> 26:26.333
Captain, you must return
at once. They will need you.

26:26.417 --> 26:28.542
It's time you introduced him
to the others.

26:28.625 --> 26:30.500
Please, captain,
go now. Quickly.

26:30.583 --> 26:32.250
I will be here if you need me.

26:32.333 --> 26:35.000
- I need a moment.
- Alright.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.000
Now that you have
come out of hiding

26:37.083 --> 26:39.500
I hope to see you more often,
old friend.

26:39.583 --> 26:42.250
That much seems certain.

26:42.333 --> 26:45.042
Valen go with you, Delenn.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.375
And with you, my friend.

27:01.375 --> 27:05.500
So much to do, so little time.
We must get to work.

27:05.583 --> 27:08.333
Zathras! Zathras!

27:09.708 --> 27:11.292
Hmm..

27:11.375 --> 27:14.333
Never around when he's needed.

27:18.292 --> 27:19.958
Garibaldi, we've got trouble.

27:20.042 --> 27:21.458
- So, what else is new?
- I mean major.

27:21.542 --> 27:23.042
We just got the word,
the Centauri have begun

27:23.125 --> 27:25.167
an all-out offensive
against the Narn Homeworld.

27:25.250 --> 27:26.833
'Started about an hour ago.'

27:26.917 --> 27:29.042
Oh, no.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.208
Is there any word
on how it's going?

27:30.292 --> 27:31.917
Not yet, we got an early relay

27:32.000 --> 27:33.542
from an Earth listening post.

27:33.625 --> 27:35.333
But word's gonna be hitting
the station any time now.

27:35.417 --> 27:37.458
When that happens, it's gonna be
riots and blood in the streets.

27:37.542 --> 27:39.125
Alright, I'll need authorization
to lock down the station.

27:39.208 --> 27:40.458
You got it.

27:40.542 --> 27:41.958
I'll have my people close off
traffic between levels

27:42.042 --> 27:43.542
break up any group
larger than five.

27:43.625 --> 27:44.917
I recommend you post
a general alert

27:45.000 --> 27:46.458
telling anybody
without urgent business

27:46.542 --> 27:48.208
to stay inside their quarters
until this thing is over.

27:48.292 --> 27:50.250
It's already recorded, it'll
go out on the station monitors

27:50.333 --> 27:51.917
as soon as the word hits.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.375
This is it, Michael.
The balloon's going up.

27:54.458 --> 27:57.417
We interrupt this program
with this late-breaking story.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.750
Officials in Earth Dome confirm
that the Centauri Republic

28:00.833 --> 28:02.583
'has begun a devastating'

28:02.667 --> 28:05.125
'frontal assault
on the Narn Homeworld.'

28:05.208 --> 28:06.917
'Reports continue
to come in alleging that'

28:07.000 --> 28:09.125
'the main Narn fleet
has been neutralized'

28:09.208 --> 28:12.250
'and that Narn is completely
encircled by its enemies.'

28:12.333 --> 28:14.417
'Neither government
has yet confirmed nor denied'

28:14.500 --> 28:16.625
'these reports,
though some messages'

28:16.708 --> 28:19.250
'relayed from Narn
seem to corroborate the stories'

28:19.333 --> 28:21.625
'of massive destruction
and death.'

28:21.708 --> 28:23.333
'For the latest developments
on this story, we take..'

28:23.417 --> 28:25.583
[growls]

28:25.667 --> 28:28.708
[intense music]

28:43.917 --> 28:45.750
[alarm blaring]

28:45.833 --> 28:46.958
What's the situation?

28:47.042 --> 28:48.458
We've got mass riots
all over the place.

28:48.542 --> 28:50.000
Garibaldi's men
are doing what they can.

28:50.083 --> 28:51.458
- We've closed off all sections.
- 'Good.'

28:51.542 --> 28:53.333
Escort Ambassador Delenn
to her quarters.

28:53.417 --> 28:54.750
See to it she arrives safely.

28:54.833 --> 28:56.292
- Captain.
- It's alright.

28:56.375 --> 28:57.625
Now go on.

28:59.250 --> 29:00.625
- Any word about the attack?
- Just rumors.

29:00.708 --> 29:02.417
They say the Centauri
are using mass drivers.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.583
I can't believe they'd resort
to planetary bombardment.

29:04.667 --> 29:07.083
Yeah, right now,
I'd believe just about anything.

29:07.167 --> 29:10.208
[dramatic music]

29:37.125 --> 29:40.208
[music continues]

30:08.000 --> 30:10.542
(male #1)
'With the planetary bombardment
in its fourth day'

30:10.625 --> 30:14.333
'the Narn government continues
in its refusal to surrender.'

30:14.417 --> 30:17.042
'Minbari, Vorlon, Earth
and other governments'

30:17.125 --> 30:20.042
'have filed official protests
with the Centauri Republic'

30:20.125 --> 30:21.958
'for their use
of mass drivers against'

30:22.042 --> 30:23.417
'the civilian population.'

30:23.500 --> 30:26.208
'But so far, the protests
have had no effect.'

30:26.292 --> 30:29.208
Although communication with
the Narn Homeworld is difficult

30:29.292 --> 30:33.542
at best, due to the continued
attacks, word has reached ISN

30:33.625 --> 30:37.042
'of cities utterly destroyed,
hundreds of thousands of'

30:37.125 --> 30:40.125
'casualties, the total
elimination of power and water'

30:40.208 --> 30:42.417
'over most of the Narn
planetary surface.'

30:42.500 --> 30:44.333
'Most of their
major cities have fallen'

30:44.417 --> 30:45.833
'food shipments have stopped'

30:45.917 --> 30:47.750
'the planetary economy
has collapsed'

30:47.833 --> 30:50.625
'and medical treatment
is virtually non-existent.'

30:50.708 --> 30:53.583
Government analysts predict
that unless the Narn government

30:53.667 --> 30:56.083
surrenders soon
their entire infrastructure

30:56.167 --> 30:58.167
will be totally destroyed.

30:58.250 --> 31:00.125
'To quote
Senator Ronald Quantrell'

31:00.208 --> 31:03.542
'"They're being bombed back
into the Stone Age."'

31:03.625 --> 31:04.625
Off.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.917
(G'Kar)
Then there's no other way?

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
If the bombardment
continues in a few more days

31:10.083 --> 31:12.000
we won't be able
to keep them out anyway

31:12.083 --> 31:15.583
and hundreds of thousands
more will die.

31:15.667 --> 31:17.667
We have no choice
but to surrender.

31:17.750 --> 31:20.833
- What about our people here?
- I don't know.

31:20.917 --> 31:23.625
It will depend
on the terms of the surrender.

31:23.708 --> 31:28.417
With luck, the Centauri will be
feeling generous. If not--

31:28.500 --> 31:30.833
Either way, I'll return home
on the next shuttle.

31:30.917 --> 31:32.208
- I should be there.
- 'No.'

31:32.292 --> 31:35.292
If you come back here
you will only be killed.

31:35.375 --> 31:38.625
You are the only one of
the Kha'Ri who is still safe.

31:38.708 --> 31:42.792
- I should be with my family.
- I understand how you feel.

31:42.875 --> 31:45.292
But if you want to save them,
you have to listen to me.

31:45.375 --> 31:47.083
I've to go soon,
I don't know how much longer

31:47.167 --> 31:48.875
we can keep this channel open.

31:48.958 --> 31:51.542
The power keeps going out.

31:51.625 --> 31:55.375
Before that happens, I have a
message for you from the Kha'Ri.

31:55.458 --> 31:58.625
It is probably the last message
they will ever send..

31:58.708 --> 32:02.208
...and the hardest thing
I have ever asked you to do.

32:04.833 --> 32:07.625
[intense music]

32:15.083 --> 32:16.458
Ambassador?

32:27.500 --> 32:30.208
Captain Sheridan, I..

32:30.292 --> 32:34.000
I've been instructed by
my government to come to you..

32:34.083 --> 32:35.417
...and ask for..

32:36.417 --> 32:39.083
[inhales deeply]

32:39.167 --> 32:40.542
...sanctuary.

32:44.958 --> 32:47.792
[music continues]

32:52.125 --> 32:53.250
Mr. Garibaldi.

32:53.333 --> 32:54.833
I've arranged for
around the clock security

32:54.917 --> 32:56.542
until this is over.

32:56.625 --> 32:58.167
Thank you.

32:58.250 --> 33:01.375
Could you tell Captain Sheridan
that I wish to convene a meeting

33:01.458 --> 33:04.208
of the Babylon 5 Advisory
Council and the League of

33:04.292 --> 33:08.125
Non-Aligned Worlds
as quickly as possible?

33:08.208 --> 33:11.292
I have an announcement to make.

33:12.167 --> 33:13.583
Fine.

33:14.583 --> 33:15.667
Fine.

33:21.042 --> 33:24.583
A little over
five standard hours ago..

33:24.667 --> 33:26.792
...the conflict which began

33:26.875 --> 33:29.458
with the Narn
declaration of war..

33:29.542 --> 33:32.250
...came to an end.

33:32.333 --> 33:34.333
The Narn regime has offered

33:34.417 --> 33:37.375
complete and
unconditional surrender.

33:38.708 --> 33:40.542
[indistinct chattering]

33:42.208 --> 33:44.417
The terms imposed by

33:44.500 --> 33:48.125
the Centauri Republic
are as follows..

33:49.667 --> 33:52.333
One, the ruling body

33:52.417 --> 33:55.792
known as the Kha'Ri
will be disbanded

33:55.875 --> 33:59.333
and its members
subject to arrest and trial

33:59.417 --> 34:02.750
for the commission of war crimes
against the Centauri.

34:02.833 --> 34:06.125
Earth requests the right to send
observers to these hearings.

34:06.208 --> 34:08.208
That request is denied.

34:09.750 --> 34:11.000
Two.

34:11.083 --> 34:14.333
To prevent
further acts of terror

34:14.417 --> 34:16.208
by the Narn against our people

34:16.292 --> 34:20.125
from this day on,
the penalty for the murder of

34:20.208 --> 34:22.875
any Centauri by any Narn

34:22.958 --> 34:26.625
will be the execution
of 500 Narns.

34:26.708 --> 34:27.917
[slurring]

34:28.000 --> 34:29.750
'Including the perpetrator's
own family.'

34:29.833 --> 34:30.958
[growling]

34:31.042 --> 34:34.708
Three, a provisional
ruling council

34:34.792 --> 34:36.292
appointed by my government

34:36.375 --> 34:39.125
will take up the responsibility

34:39.208 --> 34:43.375
of rebuilding a more
civilized Narn government

34:43.458 --> 34:46.250
as a colony of the greater
Centauri Republic.

34:49.667 --> 34:51.625
Is there anything else?

34:55.875 --> 34:57.333
Yes.

34:57.417 --> 35:00.083
Just...one thing.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.458
Because the Narn Homeworld
is now a protectorate

35:05.542 --> 35:08.792
of the Centauri Republic,
reserve the right

35:08.875 --> 35:12.667
to determine
who can speak for Narn.

35:12.750 --> 35:15.042
As a result, Ambassador G'Kar

35:15.125 --> 35:17.500
may no longer represent the Narn

35:17.583 --> 35:20.708
in any official
capacity whatsoever.

35:20.792 --> 35:22.208
'His appointment as ambassador'

35:22.292 --> 35:25.542
'to Babylon 5
is hereby withdrawn.'

35:25.625 --> 35:29.375
And as the only member
of the Kha'Ri still at large

35:29.458 --> 35:32.250
Citizen G'Kar..

35:32.333 --> 35:34.542
...will return
to Narn for trial.

35:34.625 --> 35:36.667
I'm afraid that's not possible.

35:38.500 --> 35:40.375
Prior to this meeting
Ambassador G'Kar

35:40.458 --> 35:44.208
asked for sanctuary
on Babylon 5.

35:44.292 --> 35:48.542
As it is within my province to
make such decisions, I agreed.

35:48.625 --> 35:51.292
Surrender by all members
of the Kha'Ri

35:51.375 --> 35:53.583
is stipulated in the
Narn-Centauri agreement.

35:53.667 --> 35:57.875
Oh, I'm sure it is, but I didn't
sign that agreement, ambassador.

35:57.958 --> 35:59.333
Neither did Earth.

35:59.417 --> 36:02.375
As cosponsor of Babylon 5,
the Minbari government

36:02.458 --> 36:05.333
supports this decision.

36:05.417 --> 36:06.917
The neutrality of this station

36:07.000 --> 36:09.750
applies even to the
wishes of the Centauri.

36:09.833 --> 36:13.417
'Citizen G'Kar may remain here
for as long as he chooses.'

36:13.500 --> 36:15.625
(John)
'Face reality,
Ambassador Mollari.'

36:15.708 --> 36:18.583
If your government is serious
about all these rules

36:18.667 --> 36:20.750
you're going to need
someone here

36:20.833 --> 36:24.083
whom all the other Narn
will recognize as credible.

36:24.167 --> 36:26.917
If this is your decision..

36:27.000 --> 36:29.083
...then I cannot stop you.

36:29.167 --> 36:31.750
Nevertheless, at this moment

36:31.833 --> 36:36.167
G'Kar is no longer an official
representative of Narn

36:36.250 --> 36:38.417
and must be removed
from this council.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.708
- We will wait until--
Now!

36:43.917 --> 36:46.958
[intense music]

37:15.333 --> 37:19.917
No dictator...no invader..

37:20.000 --> 37:21.958
...can hold
an imprisoned population

37:22.042 --> 37:25.458
by force of arms forever.

37:25.542 --> 37:29.083
There is no greater power
in the universe

37:29.167 --> 37:31.333
than the need for freedom.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.917
Against that power,
governments and tyrants

37:36.000 --> 37:38.792
'and armies cannot stand.'

37:42.417 --> 37:45.667
The Centauri
learned this lesson once.

37:45.750 --> 37:48.625
[music continues]

37:48.708 --> 37:51.000
We will teach it to them again.

37:54.042 --> 37:56.292
Though it take
a thousand years..

37:58.625 --> 38:00.750
...we will be free.

38:15.458 --> 38:18.500
[music continues]

38:22.958 --> 38:25.208
(male #1)
'And dancing in the streets
as Centauri Emperor Cartagia'

38:25.292 --> 38:27.208
'declared a weeklong
public celebration'

38:27.292 --> 38:30.417
'to commemorate the recapture
of the Narn Homeworld.'

38:30.500 --> 38:33.167
'In related news,
the Centauri Republic today'

38:33.250 --> 38:36.208
'announced plans to annex
several smaller worlds adjacent'

38:36.292 --> 38:40.333
'to Narn space declaring them
protectorates of the Republic.'

38:40.417 --> 38:42.583
'While government spokesmen
insist that the Centauri'

38:42.667 --> 38:44.667
'do not have
any expansionist plans'

'beyond retaking
the Narn Homeworld'

38:46.708 --> 38:49.708
'others in Earth Dome
are less sure.'

38:55.292 --> 38:57.542
G'Kar, I know we've had our..

38:57.625 --> 38:59.542
...problems in the past..

39:02.125 --> 39:05.250
...but I can't imagine
going into the council chambers

39:05.333 --> 39:06.917
and not seeing you there.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.625
Straight, tall, ready to argue
with anyone about anything.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.917
I don't know, I...I don't think

39:17.000 --> 39:20.042
I want to go the next...
10 years..

39:22.042 --> 39:23.917
...without your insight.

39:25.542 --> 39:27.500
Or your words.

39:29.292 --> 39:32.958
For what it's worth..

39:33.042 --> 39:34.708
...every resource that I have

39:34.792 --> 39:37.333
every...contact..

39:39.125 --> 39:43.042
...any way that I can help you
win back your planet..

39:47.583 --> 39:49.208
...it's yours.

39:53.750 --> 39:57.250
The last time I offered
someone my hand..

39:57.333 --> 40:00.167
...we were at war
24 hours later.

40:20.333 --> 40:22.083
[device beeping]

40:22.167 --> 40:23.500
- Sheridan.
- 'Captain.'

'Ambassador Delenn
has asked to see you.'

40:25.000 --> 40:27.375
'She's in the
conference center.'

40:27.458 --> 40:28.875
Be right there.

40:28.958 --> 40:31.917
[indistinct chattering]

40:45.167 --> 40:47.583
Is it someone's birthday
and I wasn't informed?

40:49.458 --> 40:53.417
Most of these people have come
to meet you for the first time.

40:53.500 --> 40:56.417
Some of the others
you already know.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.000
They have come to pledge
themselves to you.

41:01.208 --> 41:03.708
Well, I-I don't understand.

41:03.792 --> 41:05.583
They call themselves Rangers.

41:05.667 --> 41:07.542
They've been coming through
the station now for sometime

41:07.625 --> 41:10.375
carrying information on the war,
other things.

41:10.458 --> 41:14.167
They have sworn their lives,
their fortunes and their blood

41:14.250 --> 41:17.042
to help fight
the coming darkness.

41:17.125 --> 41:19.958
Have you known about these...
Rangers all this time?

41:20.042 --> 41:21.042
Most of it.

41:21.125 --> 41:22.125
I found out about it

41:22.208 --> 41:23.542
about eight, nine months ago.

41:23.625 --> 41:24.917
And you didn't tell me?

41:25.000 --> 41:26.958
- Why?
- Because I promised a friend.

41:27.042 --> 41:29.917
Captain...John.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.417
You see what is happening
all around us.

41:32.500 --> 41:35.083
The Great War is nearly upon us.

41:35.167 --> 41:37.958
Now that the Narn, Centauri
conflict has finished

41:38.042 --> 41:42.042
the next wave will come soon,
even more deadly.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.083
There must be
one fortress of light

41:44.167 --> 41:46.250
to stand against the darkness.

41:46.333 --> 41:48.750
That place is this place.

41:48.833 --> 41:51.875
It must be protected
at any cost.

41:51.958 --> 41:55.333
Until now, the Rangers
assigned to this area

41:55.417 --> 41:58.625
have been under
my direct command.

41:58.708 --> 42:02.333
I now transfer
equal authority to you.

42:02.417 --> 42:07.083
And like them, I will
stand by you in the days ahead.

42:07.167 --> 42:09.875
Well, I don't
quite know what to say.

42:12.958 --> 42:15.500
For the last year..

42:15.583 --> 42:19.083
...things haven't exactly
been going our way.

42:19.167 --> 42:21.917
I started to wonder
if it would ever get better.

42:24.917 --> 42:27.042
I think it just did.

42:29.500 --> 42:32.917
Tell the other Rangers,
the ambassadors..

42:33.000 --> 42:35.875
...everyone in this...
army of light..

42:37.417 --> 42:40.083
...that Babylon 5
stands with you.

42:40.167 --> 42:41.750
Tell them..

42:43.625 --> 42:47.750
Tell them that from this place,
we will deliver notice

42:47.833 --> 42:49.625
to the parliaments of conquerors

42:49.708 --> 42:53.375
that a line has been drawn
against the darkness

42:54.500 --> 42:57.375
and we will hold that line..

42:58.667 --> 43:00.792
...no matter the cost.

43:03.875 --> 43:06.750

43:09.333 --> 43:11.500
