WEBVTT

00:38.788 --> 00:40.623
It's not an exact fit.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.084
I get my own comm device?

00:43.168 --> 00:46.755
Technically, it was Crosshair's,
but he doesn't appear to need it.

00:46.838 --> 00:49.466
Echo, what's your position? Over.

00:50.091 --> 00:52.927
It's not a toy, Omega.

00:53.845 --> 00:54.929
Copy that.

00:56.473 --> 01:00.518
Why are we going to Ord Mantell?
I thought the plan was to lay low.

01:01.102 --> 01:04.856
Not while a bounty hunter's after you.
We need to find out why.

01:05.482 --> 01:09.319
I know an informant there named Cid
who might be able to help.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.363
And you trust him?

01:11.446 --> 01:12.864
Well, the Jedi trusted him.

01:12.947 --> 01:15.075
The Jedi who are all dead?

01:15.158 --> 01:16.868
Well, anyone have a better option?

01:18.495 --> 01:20.038
He has a point.

01:22.665 --> 01:24.042
Right. Not a toy.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.817
Remember the rules?

01:48.900 --> 01:52.278
Don't wander off,
keep my eyes and ears on my surroundings,

01:52.362 --> 01:53.905
and trust no one but my squad.

01:53.988 --> 01:57.951
And if you get into trouble?
-Use my comm and give my location.

02:04.582 --> 02:05.792
This is the place.

02:06.918 --> 02:07.919
Charming.

02:18.388 --> 02:21.391
Filthy cheat! I saw that!

02:22.142 --> 02:24.644
Me? Who are you calling a cheat?

02:24.728 --> 02:26.438
Which one of them is Cid?

02:26.521 --> 02:27.689
I couldn't tell ya.

02:27.772 --> 02:30.650
I only heard about Cid.
Never actually met him.

02:30.734 --> 02:33.445
That would have been information
to share earlier.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.575
We're looking for Cid. You know him?

02:38.658 --> 02:40.160
You know what you did!

02:40.243 --> 02:42.203
-Cid, huh?
-

02:42.287 --> 02:44.372
You broke the machine again
with your stupid hands!

02:44.456 --> 02:45.665
Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.292
What about them?

02:47.375 --> 02:49.419
I'll break you with my stupid hands.

02:49.502 --> 02:53.840
Was I not clear?
You're in the wrong place.

02:53.923 --> 02:57.844
So unless you're here
to spend money, get lost.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.680
Great plan, Echo.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.432
I'm certain this is Cid's.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.267
The Jedi came here during the war.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.563
Well, perhaps Cid heard
what happened to the Jedi and fled.

03:09.147 --> 03:12.984
Or he was arrested for violating
countless health code regulations.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.822
What's your deal, tiny?

03:17.906 --> 03:19.240
You're Cid.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.870
You're sharper than your friends
over there.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.247
Did the Jedi have any other informants?

03:26.331 --> 03:29.584
Several, but Cid was the only one
I knew how to find.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.629
So, we came all this way for nothing?

03:32.712 --> 03:34.047
I found Cid.

03:41.179 --> 03:44.015
I had a good thing going with the Jedi.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.643
They valued my insights,

03:47.310 --> 03:53.233
but now that they're all dead,
the demand for my services has declined.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.735
Thanks to this new Empire.

03:55.819 --> 03:58.446
Times have changed... for all of us.

03:58.530 --> 03:59.864
No kidding.

03:59.948 --> 04:03.076
I never had
clone deserters come to me before.

04:03.159 --> 04:07.455
Yes, well, we separated due to
a fundamental difference in ideology.

04:07.539 --> 04:10.000
That's cute, you thinking I care.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.835
Cut to it and tell me what you want.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.302
By all means, make yourself at home.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.514
We encountered this woman on Pantora.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.558
Do you know who she is?

04:27.058 --> 04:29.894
No, but I know a bounty hunter
when I see one.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.313
Can you find out who hired her?

04:32.897 --> 04:35.191
That depends on what you boys do for me.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.572
Are you fresh outta the tube?

04:41.156 --> 04:45.827
You pull a job for me,
and I get the information you want.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.829
That's how this mercenary thing works.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.205
Mercenary?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.541
Not too quick, are ya?

04:51.624 --> 04:54.210
Clearly, the kid's the brains
of your operation.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.714
What kind of job?

04:58.506 --> 05:00.216
A rescue.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.511
There's a nice bounty
on a kid named Muchi.

05:04.262 --> 05:08.350
My sources say
she was taken by Zygerrian slavers

05:08.433 --> 05:11.061
who are holed up
on the other side of the planet.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.105
Bring me the kid
and I'll get you your intel.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.648
Well, who collects the bounty?

05:15.732 --> 05:17.525
Oh, look. It talks.

05:18.485 --> 05:23.073
We split the bounty 70-30, my favor.
Take it or leave it.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.408
Grab a kid from a few Zygerrians?

05:25.492 --> 05:28.036
We could do that in our sleep.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.538
Looks like we have a deal.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.833
Details of the bounty are on that.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.168
Don't screw it up.

05:43.802 --> 05:44.803
You all right?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.389
Yeah, yeah. It's nothing.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.767
According to Cid's intel,

05:50.850 --> 05:55.355
the Zygerrian slave traders are hiding
in the ruins of Old Ord Mantell city.

05:57.232 --> 05:58.650
What's a slave trader?

05:58.733 --> 06:01.319
Someone who buys and sells people
for credits.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.279
People can be sold?

06:03.988 --> 06:08.159
They don't have a choice.
They're captives treated like property.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.121
That... doesn't seem right.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.205
It's not.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.709
And we are going to stop it
from happening to that kid.

06:15.792 --> 06:19.629
As well as earn a decent amount of credits
once the job is complete.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.756
Yeah, that too.

06:22.966 --> 06:26.511
Don't worry, Muchi. We'll rescue you.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.085
I have a visual.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.671
I only see one child.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.382
Poor Muchi. She looks scared.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.676
I'm clocking two dozen hostiles.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.721
Multiple entry points
with minor fortification.

07:09.804 --> 07:13.016
Simple smash and grab
like that time on Kuat.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.351
Easy enough.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.144
I'm in. What are we waiting for?

07:16.227 --> 07:18.563
You get back to the ship.
-But--

07:19.564 --> 07:20.815
That's an order.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.611
Yes, sir.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.132
Echo, you're the eyes in the sky.

07:46.216 --> 07:49.886
Wrecker, draw the Zygerrian forces out.
Tech and I will grab the kid.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.262
Not a problem.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.105
Echo, sitrep.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.692
Two roving patrols on speeders.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.735
First guard checkpoint dead ahead.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.242
Hang on. I think I've got company.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.285
Well, take care of it. Quietly.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.162
-

08:17.288 --> 08:19.165
- Watch out!

08:32.095 --> 08:35.432
A mission of this nature
requires planning.

08:35.515 --> 08:39.394
Assure your employer,
he'll be reunited with Muchi soon.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.900
Now, now. There's no need for threats.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.653
I have my best people on it.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.869
-

09:03.293 --> 09:06.212
I'm making some alterations to my trooper.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.714
Now she's a Bad Batcher.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.507
-What do you think?
-

09:09.591 --> 09:11.676
We found their ship.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.762
Gonky, hide.

09:20.727 --> 09:21.811
Check the hold.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.688
Make sure no one's on board.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.470
The ship is clear.
We're returning to base.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.400
-Hunter, do you copy?
-

10:08.483 --> 10:10.360
Tech? Echo? Wrecker?

10:11.194 --> 10:12.278
Anyone?

10:31.047 --> 10:32.173
It's getting looser.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.387
Do that one more time and you'll be--

10:39.723 --> 10:42.517
Save your energy. We are going to need it.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.957
Relax, Muchi. We're the cavalry.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.335
What are our odds out of this, Tech?

11:08.418 --> 11:09.586
I am not certain.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.463
So much for being smart.

11:11.546 --> 11:15.175
This is not a standard military operation,

11:15.258 --> 11:17.052
and seeing as how we've never been tasked

11:17.135 --> 11:19.846
with rescuing a child
from slave traders before,

11:19.929 --> 11:21.973
there is no data I can compare it to.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.684
We need to signal Omega
before their scouts find her.

11:24.768 --> 11:28.605
Except our comms are over there
with our weapons.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.695
We won't need a comm to signal her.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.960
Look at what we have here.

11:51.044 --> 11:55.548
Four new slaves to add to my collection.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.467
Strong ones too.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.678
You should fetch a nice price.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.680
The Republic outlawed slavery.

12:01.763 --> 12:05.600
We're not in the Republic anymore, skug.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.315
You're lucky we don't have our gear

12:12.399 --> 12:14.776
because this would go
very differently for you.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.292
-

12:45.432 --> 12:48.935
We can make do with one less slave.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.688
Maybe I'll feed you to my pet.

12:55.066 --> 13:00.363
As for the rest of you,
you will be part of a new beginning.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.824
With the meddling Republic gone,

13:02.907 --> 13:07.454
we can return to Kadavo
and rebuild what was taken from us.

13:08.747 --> 13:14.586
Under this new Empire,
our operation will flourish once again.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.465
-And if you do not comply...
-Hmm.

13:18.548 --> 13:19.591
I know.

13:19.674 --> 13:22.969
...the person
next to you will pay the price.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.145
No--
-Gotcha!

13:32.228 --> 13:34.064
Let me go!

13:35.148 --> 13:37.067
I found her sneaking around the cage.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.362
I wasn't sneaking.

13:41.196 --> 13:42.572
I was unlocking.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.282
-

13:44.366 --> 13:45.617
Secure the cage.

13:51.706 --> 13:54.000
Stop her. Don't let her get away.

14:00.757 --> 14:04.844
A rampaging adolescent rancor is not
the distraction I was anticipating.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.471
That's their problem.

14:06.554 --> 14:07.764
We're getting out of here.

14:24.406 --> 14:25.615
It's okay, Muchi.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.158
We're here to take you home.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.705
Muchi! Muchi!

14:33.998 --> 14:36.501
The rancor is Muchi?

14:45.802 --> 14:48.179
Gear up. We have to go after Muchi.

14:48.263 --> 14:51.599
If we don't capture her,
we don't get our intel from Cid.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.570
What about them?

15:03.653 --> 15:06.823
Omega and I will get them
to safety. You find Muchi.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.492
Right. Go for the speeders
at the south entrance.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.636
She's doing fine on her own.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.223
-

15:59.793 --> 16:00.919
Hyah!

16:28.905 --> 16:31.241
You're going to pay for this, skug.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.411
I'll handle him. Go get Muchi.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.205
Omega, stay close!

17:48.777 --> 17:50.737
Any ideas how to stop that thing?

17:52.655 --> 17:55.075
Rancors adhere to a social hierarchy.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.621
You have to challenge the alpha
for authority.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.980
You're free. Go quickly.

18:28.858 --> 18:29.943
Bye.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.865
Come on. Let's get back to the others.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.952
-

18:44.082 --> 18:45.625
How long's he been at this?

18:45.709 --> 18:47.836
Too long. He's losing his touch.

18:47.919 --> 18:50.005
Oh. You--
-

18:56.469 --> 18:58.513
-Come on, Muchi.
-

18:58.596 --> 18:59.639
Go to sleep.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.685
There we go.

19:03.768 --> 19:07.355
Aw. She's kinda cute up close.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.233
Nicely handled, Wrecker.

19:15.113 --> 19:17.032
What a pleasant surprise.

19:17.115 --> 19:21.828
I'm graced by the presence
of Jabba's right-hand man.

19:29.127 --> 19:31.338
Bib, relax.

19:31.421 --> 19:34.632
I always deliver on my promises.
You'll see.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.680
I told you, this is a delicate mission.

19:40.764 --> 19:42.682
Tell Jabba to be patient.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.439
Oh, Muchi.

19:54.027 --> 19:57.280
Aw. That's a good rancor.

19:59.449 --> 20:00.492
Ah.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.204
-

20:09.000 --> 20:12.045
See, Bib? All is well.

20:12.128 --> 20:15.006
Now, about the matter of payment.

20:15.090 --> 20:16.508
-

20:24.349 --> 20:25.850
Bye, Muchi.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.565
Gotta say, fellas.

20:32.649 --> 20:35.944
I wasn't sure you could pull this job off.

20:36.027 --> 20:39.531
You could have told us
we were going after a rancor.

20:39.614 --> 20:42.659
Hmm. Must've slipped my mind.

20:43.326 --> 20:46.413
You, dark and broody. My office.

20:51.292 --> 20:54.004
Your bounty hunter is Fennec Shand.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.547
She's new to the scene

20:55.630 --> 20:59.050
but has already proven herself
to be cunning and ruthless.

20:59.634 --> 21:00.635
Who hired her?

21:01.219 --> 21:02.470
Unknown.

21:02.554 --> 21:06.266
My sources in the Guild say
she's working on a direct commission.

21:07.017 --> 21:09.561
With someone like her nipping
at your heels,

21:09.644 --> 21:13.314
you're going to need two things:
friends and money.

21:13.398 --> 21:14.983
Mostly money.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.527
Well, we're not swimming in either
at the moment.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.488
I guess it's a good thing ya met me then,
isn't it?

21:23.491 --> 21:24.617
Here's your cut.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.246
There's more where that came from...

21:29.080 --> 21:30.790
if you're looking for work.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.626
I'll think about it.

21:35.211 --> 21:36.546
It's interesting,

21:36.629 --> 21:39.674
a bounty hunter of Fennec's caliber
being after you.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.677
You fellas must be pretty valuable.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.098
Don't worry.

21:47.182 --> 21:49.100
I'm good with secrets.
