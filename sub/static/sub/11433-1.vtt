00:51.018 --> 00:52.720
You don't like this stuff?

put something else on?

01:55.649 --> 01:56.784
Where you going?

01:56.817 --> 01:58.752
Sorry.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.222
I'm late.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.191
What are you late for?

02:03.224 --> 02:04.592
-Yeah, I gotta go.
-Wait, wait.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.393
Hey, hey, hey.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.194
Sorry.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.628
What's your-- name?

02:08.662 --> 02:12.200
You can't go any
faster, can you?

02:12.233 --> 02:13.100
Never mind.

02:19.673 --> 02:20.441
Fuck!

02:20.474 --> 02:21.342
What the hell?

02:27.114 --> 02:28.616
Hi.

02:28.649 --> 02:29.450
Holy shit.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.051
She is alive.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.654
We can stop calling the
hospitals and the morgues now.

02:33.687 --> 02:34.822
Sorry.

02:34.855 --> 02:35.789
Let's do it again.

(SINGING) Smooth

02:48.836 --> 02:50.471
Next, Q103.

What's that?

02:51.405 --> 02:52.273
Christian rock.

02:52.306 --> 02:55.476
This one goes, Q103, The Rock.

02:55.509 --> 02:59.313
You punch rock, and then you
do-- [humming] on salvation.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.549
Go.

03:01.582 --> 03:05.118
(SINGING) Q103, The
Rock of salvation.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.492
That would give Jesus a boner.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.936
MAN ON PHONE: So when do
you have to be out by?

03:22.970 --> 03:24.438
Uh end of the month.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.839
Yeah, I'd offer
you our spare room,

03:25.873 --> 03:27.207
but it might be a
little awkward, him

03:27.241 --> 03:28.842
having that big house, and all.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.043
Yeah, I know.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.446
Uh, it's fine.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.615
So I hear you have a new song?

03:34.648 --> 03:36.984
It's-- it's not ready yet.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.720
Surprise, surprise.

03:39.753 --> 03:42.055
So are you coming
out this week?

03:42.089 --> 03:43.924
I need all the allies I can get.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.393
Are you talking
to me hands free?

03:45.426 --> 03:48.262
What, are you a
cop all of a sudden?

03:48.296 --> 03:50.197
It's not safe.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.865
Yeah, I'm on my headphones.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.402
Look, are you coming or not?

03:54.435 --> 03:56.904

Jude?

03:57.905 --> 03:59.206
Alan.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.809
Alan.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.311
Jude?

04:03.344 --> 04:04.312
Alan?

04:04.345 --> 04:05.045
Shit.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.159
[rock music]

04:23.764 --> 04:26.634
In my heart is for strangers.

04:31.739 --> 04:35.609
Kind, but my own blood
is much too dangerous.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.123
Hello?

07:06.727 --> 07:08.929
Is anybody home?

07:08.962 --> 07:11.164
PAUL: Who's there?

07:11.198 --> 07:13.701
Jude?

07:13.734 --> 07:14.635
Jude.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.836
Hi, Paul.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.138
I hate that.

07:18.171 --> 07:21.274
How you doing, doll?

07:21.308 --> 07:22.175
I'm OK.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.844
OK, OK.

07:23.877 --> 07:24.878
How was the drive?

07:24.912 --> 07:26.446
Boring.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.315
How are you?

07:28.348 --> 07:31.451
I shot a ninth
one this morning.

07:31.485 --> 07:32.720
Oh, is that good?

07:32.753 --> 07:33.621
Corinne's here.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.156
Come out back.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.858
Be nice.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.927
CORINNE: No, no, no,
we can't go in April.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.496
No, no, Marcus says
he won't be ready.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.065
Have you had his gazpacho?

07:45.098 --> 07:49.036
Oh, it's astronishing.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.738
I know, it reminds me of Mamet.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.678
Hi, Jude.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.279
Hi, Lucille.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.914
How was your trip?

08:00.948 --> 08:02.415
Boring.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.518
Do you want anything to drink?

08:04.552 --> 08:06.319
Diet Coke?

08:06.353 --> 08:07.921
Yeah.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.523
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks.

08:09.557 --> 08:10.457
There's some in the fridge.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.592
And be a dear and
get me some more

08:11.625 --> 08:12.626
chardonnay while you're there.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.955
Darling, what was
the name of that kid

08:41.989 --> 08:43.423
we went to Dalton with?

08:43.456 --> 08:45.358
The one who got kicked out for
writing those dirty letters

08:45.392 --> 08:46.827
to Miss Darcy?
-That was Adam Foresberg.

08:46.860 --> 08:47.961
Adam never got kicked out.

08:47.995 --> 08:48.929
No, I think he did.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.497
No, his family
moved to Indonesia.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.865
Oh, no, I know who
you're talking about.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.834
You're talking about
that, um-- the kid who

08:53.867 --> 08:55.703
always wore that mounty shirt.

08:55.736 --> 08:58.739
Mm, went out with
denim jacket girl.

08:58.772 --> 08:59.539
Shawna Brant?

08:59.573 --> 09:00.373
Oh.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.809
You mean Shawna do you wanna?

09:01.842 --> 09:03.043
That is harsh.

09:03.076 --> 09:03.977
But true.

09:04.011 --> 09:04.978
Jude, would you
go in the kitchen

09:05.012 --> 09:07.748
and get me some
more horseradish?

09:07.781 --> 09:09.016
Help Lucille.

09:09.049 --> 09:13.386
Her leg is bothering her.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.522
Is she kidding
with that pink hair?

09:15.555 --> 09:16.289
Still?

09:16.323 --> 09:17.357
Like she's so punk?

09:17.390 --> 09:18.525
This steak is not good.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.559
Where's it from?

09:19.593 --> 09:20.594
--[inaudible] just
got it at Siderello.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.596
Tell her to go into
town from now on.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.898
Farmer's market.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.399
You're welcome.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.401
I really think it was Adam
Foresberg who got kicked out.

09:28.435 --> 09:29.903
It wasn't Adam Foresberg?

09:29.937 --> 09:31.304
No, you're thinking
of Warren Wilson.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.973
I am thinking of Warren Wilson.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.541
You couldn't pay me to
go back to high school.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.144
You hardly went, even when
you were in high school.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.212
How's the restaurant, Corinne?

09:39.246 --> 09:41.514
Oh, name a problem,
we've got it.

09:41.548 --> 09:44.517
I've got a sous chef trying to
undermine my executive chef,

09:44.551 --> 09:47.387
the wait staff are
like paint in place,

09:47.420 --> 09:50.257
bartenders are thieves-- I
swear, it's like a Mamet play.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.291
They steal.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.860
How exactly is that
like a Mamet play?

09:52.893 --> 09:54.261
What's paint in place?

09:54.294 --> 09:56.664
Speaking of Mamet, did anyone
see that actress on "The View?"

09:56.697 --> 09:57.798
Which actress?

09:57.831 --> 09:59.199
You know, the one that
was fat, and then got

09:59.232 --> 10:00.634
thin, and then got fat again.

10:00.668 --> 10:01.601
Anyone ready for more wine?

10:01.635 --> 10:02.335
Oh, I am.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.506
Oh, right.

10:06.539 --> 10:07.240
Sorry.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.856
Which lawsuit is
this one, again?

10:22.890 --> 10:24.858
It's against this
Dutch record company.

10:24.892 --> 10:27.594
Put out an LP of my
stuff, unauthorized.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.529
No one calls them
LPs anymore, Paul.

10:29.562 --> 10:33.100
Jude sang backup, so
they want to depose her.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.236
So, uh, how long
are you staying?

10:36.269 --> 10:38.105
Um--

10:38.138 --> 10:38.906
What?

10:38.939 --> 10:39.973
What did I say?

10:40.007 --> 10:41.842
Uh, no-- uh, nothing.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.544
It's just that, um, things
are a little bit complicated

10:44.577 --> 10:47.247
for me at the moment.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.348
Real estate wise.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.350
She's getting kicked
out of her apartment.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.085
I'm not getting kicked out.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.921
I'm simply having a
dispute with my landlord.

10:53.954 --> 10:57.257
She's disputing the
notion she should pay rent.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.625
And you're going to
move in with Paul?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.393
No.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.194
No.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.964
No?

11:03.997 --> 11:05.265
No.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.934
I just need to get out
of the city, you know?

11:06.967 --> 11:09.602
It's smothering me.

11:09.636 --> 11:10.904
Well, I mean, you
could say with us.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.605
We've got tons of space.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.674
You know what, it's funny-- I
always forget you guys actually

11:14.708 --> 11:16.643
have your own place,
since, you know,

11:16.676 --> 11:18.211
you're always here at Paul's.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.948
Well, you know, it's nice
to have your own place.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.682
I can't keep track
of these lawsuits.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.084
All frivolous, of course.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.820
And Paul keeps the East Hampton
Bar Association in pinstripes.

11:26.854 --> 11:27.654
That's true.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.256
I hate that so much.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.023
Pinstripes?

11:30.057 --> 11:31.124
That you call me Paul.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.193
You should call me Pop.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.161
You know, I'd love that.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.263
Then why did you
name me Starshadow?

11:36.296 --> 11:37.798
Starshadow's a wonderful man.

11:37.831 --> 11:38.732
Wait.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.801
Aunt Jude's real
name is Sarshadow?

11:40.834 --> 11:42.736
David.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.738
That's my luck, to be born
during his hippie period.

11:44.772 --> 11:47.775
What if you'd been born
during my jazz phase,

11:47.808 --> 11:50.110
and I had to call you Mingus?

11:50.143 --> 11:52.545
Who goes through their hippy
period in the mid '80s, anyway?

11:52.579 --> 11:54.247
Good question, Mingus.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.615
David.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.184
David, will you go upstairs
and get ready for bed, please?

11:57.217 --> 11:57.985
It's past your bedtime.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.019
I don't want to.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.153
Come on, buddy.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.922
I never minded you
changing your first name.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.390
It's the last name
that bothers me.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.892
You're not proud
to be a Lombard?

12:04.925 --> 12:07.194
You changed it from Lipman.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.461
Talk about pride.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.197
You've been pretending to
be Italian all these years

12:10.230 --> 12:11.598
when you're really Jewish.

12:11.631 --> 12:12.800
I never said I was Italian.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.102
If people think that,
it's their business.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.871
Speaking of, if we could
put aside for a moment

12:17.905 --> 12:21.474
Jude's contempt for her
lineage, I have an announcement.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.751
I'm going to cut a record.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.787
That's great.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.588
Uh, album or single?

12:35.622 --> 12:36.790
Single for know.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.893
If it does good, Alan says
there's a chance an LP.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.561
No one calls 'em LPs anymore.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.630
Uh, what's it called?

12:43.663 --> 12:45.698
"When I Live My
Life Over Again."

12:45.732 --> 12:46.800
That's a bad title.

12:46.834 --> 12:47.868
Uh who wrote it?

12:47.901 --> 12:48.668
Me.

12:48.701 --> 12:49.937
It came to him in the car.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.705
We were driving back from
Foxworth's, and kaboom, it

12:52.739 --> 12:53.941
come to me, out of the sky.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.809
That's what the great
songwriters say,

12:55.843 --> 12:58.178
that their songs come
to them fully formed.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.413
That's what Mozart said.

13:00.447 --> 13:04.517
That it felt like he was
taking dictation from God.

13:04.551 --> 13:05.819
Huh?

13:05.853 --> 13:07.587
I'm not comparing myself to
Mozart, I'm only saying--

13:07.620 --> 13:08.889
You're just comparing
yourself to God.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.992
I was driving, it was
coming to me so fast.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.626
I just said it out loud.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.428
Lucille wrote it down.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.797
But you're not really
known as a songwriter.

13:17.831 --> 13:18.899
What does it say?

13:18.932 --> 13:20.733
The two skills are related.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.336
Gershwin, Porter, Rodgers and
Hart, the great songwriters

13:23.370 --> 13:26.206
were not also necessarily
the best interpretations

13:26.239 --> 13:27.507
of their own stuff.

13:27.540 --> 13:31.111
For that you need Sinatra,
Ray Charles, Billie Holiday.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.545
Billie Holiday wrote
"Strange Fruit."

13:32.579 --> 13:33.780
No she didn't.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.515
A middle aged Jewish man
named Abe Meeropol wrote it.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.484
What is it with you and
Judaism all of a sudden?

13:37.517 --> 13:39.386
I was a vocal stylist.

13:39.419 --> 13:43.223
Did anybody complain that Brando
didn't write his own lines?

13:43.256 --> 13:45.192
It's not enough for
Olivier to be Olivier?

13:45.225 --> 13:47.861
Since when do you have an
issue with Billie Holiday?

13:47.895 --> 13:49.529
I don't have anything
against Billie Holiday.

13:49.562 --> 13:50.830
I love Billie Holiday.

13:50.864 --> 13:51.831
Singers were never expected
to write their own stuff.

13:51.865 --> 13:52.665
She just didn't
write "Strange Fruit."

13:52.699 --> 13:54.101
Not until Lennon and McCartney.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.136
Well, I think Billie
Holiday is incredible.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.005
And no one's arguing
with you, Corinne.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.672
I think she's incredible, too.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.274
In fact, I think a
lot of people are

14:01.308 --> 14:02.976
incredible who,
like Billie Holiday,

14:03.010 --> 14:04.377
did not write "Strange Fruit."

14:04.411 --> 14:07.480
It says here "Strange Fruit"
was written by Lewis Allen.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.149
That is a pseudonym
for Abe Meeropol.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.251
Also, I did write
songs over the years.

14:11.284 --> 14:14.454
I co-wrote, I collaborated
without credit.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.689
I'm not saying that at my age
I'm going to be Burt Bacharach.

14:16.723 --> 14:17.424
Excuse me.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.763
I happened to write this one.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.832
So, uh, could we hear it?

14:30.904 --> 14:32.072
Yep.

14:32.105 --> 14:32.872
Down.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.341
Big finish.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.776
[piano music]

14:42.649 --> 14:49.289
(SINGING) If life is
nasty, brutish, and short,

14:49.322 --> 14:57.564
and all this too shall pass,
can we conspire and consort

14:57.597 --> 15:02.802
to make the good times last?

15:02.835 --> 15:07.941
If youth is wasted on
the young, and it is,

15:07.975 --> 15:17.384
and time goes by too fast, if
second chances go and come,

15:17.417 --> 15:23.823
or too, too much to ask.

15:23.856 --> 15:32.532
Oh, if-- if I'd been
born in Hindustan,

15:32.565 --> 15:37.104
I'd reincarnate
like the Hindus can.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.207
I'll tell you, sir,
I've got a plan,

15:40.240 --> 15:46.146
when I live my life over again.

15:46.179 --> 15:50.483
I'm all warmed up,
and limber now.

15:50.517 --> 15:54.988
Next time, I swear I'm
going to make it count.

15:55.022 --> 15:58.491
Thank god we get more
than one go round.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.893
[inaudible] regret, [inaudible].

16:03.997 --> 16:07.500
Regrets, yes, I've had a few.

16:07.534 --> 16:15.142
Perhaps I forgot to mention, but
the passing years and graying

16:15.175 --> 16:18.111
beard are what got my attention.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.151
Take it home.

16:24.184 --> 16:29.022
So as a dress rehearsal,
this one's been fine.

16:29.056 --> 16:33.826
But now I'm going to
go for real this time,

16:33.860 --> 16:42.235
and smell the red roses when I'm
living my life all over again.

16:42.269 --> 16:49.076
Alert my friends when I
live my life over again!

16:53.080 --> 16:55.448
[cheering]

16:59.952 --> 17:01.554
It's not a bad song, you know?

17:01.588 --> 17:03.323
It's fantastic.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.391
Well, it's a little something.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.125
Anyway.

17:14.101 --> 17:15.968
[phone ringing]

17:18.738 --> 17:19.439
WOMAN ON PHONE: Hello?

17:26.913 --> 17:27.780
[sigh]

17:29.782 --> 17:33.186
(SINGING) This heart
is a foolish one.

17:33.220 --> 17:37.557
It's never worked right.

17:37.590 --> 17:46.699
It so loudly-- it so loudly
keeps me awake in the night.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.001
And it forces--

[voices on radio]

18:57.637 --> 19:00.072
RADIO: Listeners soon
found themselves entranced

19:00.106 --> 19:01.874
by the dulcet vocals
that were to become

19:01.908 --> 19:05.178
a Humperdink trademark.

19:05.212 --> 19:09.949
Humperdink combined
the influen--

19:09.982 --> 19:12.084
with the pre-rock and
roll romance of American

19:12.118 --> 19:13.553
crooner Paul Lombard.

19:13.586 --> 19:14.354
Hey.

19:14.387 --> 19:17.290
Shout out from VH1.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.492
Where's my Behind The Music?

19:19.526 --> 19:20.793
Oh, please.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.962
You don't want
that horrible shit.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.864
It's just Hollywood
exploitation.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.933
I was born too late.

19:26.966 --> 19:31.204
My era was Sinatra, Dino,
Tony Bennett, those guys.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.573
I come along at least
a decade after that.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.843
After your rock and roll had
destroyed the whole tradition.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.177
My rock and roll.

19:38.211 --> 19:38.978
Right.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.513
Who am I, Chuck Berry?

19:43.583 --> 19:46.586
Still, you had a good run.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.187
Didn't you?

19:48.221 --> 19:51.157
O king of romance.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.526
To this day, when anyone
wants some make out music,

19:53.560 --> 19:56.529
the first thing they reach
for is a Paul Lombard album.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.168
Which one?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.703
What?

20:03.736 --> 20:05.538
Which album dot hey reach for?

20:05.572 --> 20:06.339
Oh.

20:06.373 --> 20:09.242
I don't know.

20:09.276 --> 20:14.013
"In The Dark and Lonely Hours."
"Swinging at Sally's," or

20:14.046 --> 20:16.883
"Boulevard of Broken Dreams."

20:16.916 --> 20:18.351
Paul's greatest, obviously.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.619
That's a compilation.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.254
I didn't even get paid.

20:21.288 --> 20:21.988
It still counts.

20:25.091 --> 20:28.661
Seriously, I can't tell you how
many people my age have a copy

20:28.695 --> 20:30.530
of "In The Dark and Lonely."

20:30.563 --> 20:31.331
"Dark and Lonely."

20:31.364 --> 20:33.132
What a wonderful record.

20:33.165 --> 20:37.704
"Dark and Lonely" is
a wonderful record.

20:37.737 --> 20:41.974
You know, there's no single.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.744
It's gonna be the
beginning of my next act

20:44.777 --> 20:46.613
to reclaim my place.

20:49.482 --> 20:52.452
I'm glad.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.220
What?

20:54.253 --> 20:56.823
What?

20:56.856 --> 20:58.825
You don't sound enthusiastic.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.627
I'm glad sounds like
a prelude to a but.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.361
No but.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.367
It's just that--

21:07.400 --> 21:08.200
There you go.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.669
You're nothing if not critical.

21:09.702 --> 21:10.937
I was just going
to say that it's

21:10.970 --> 21:15.475
a shame it has to be motivated
by such-- I don't know,

21:15.508 --> 21:16.609
bitterness.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.645
It's called drive, and
you could take a lesson.

21:18.678 --> 21:19.612
A driving lesson?

21:19.646 --> 21:21.080
You're hilarious.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.583
You could do comedy
as part of your act.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.117
And by the way, you're right.

21:28.455 --> 21:31.491
Why wouldn't I be-- look
at where I'm living.

21:31.524 --> 21:32.625
You live in the Hamptons.

21:32.659 --> 21:35.027
Yes, the slums of the Hamptons.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.296
We're not even on the
beach side of the street.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.732
I had to cut the woods
back to three days a week.

21:39.766 --> 21:42.602
I had to get rid of the
gardener and the pool guy.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.937
At my age, it's not good.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.039
And I notice, you
never turn down

21:47.073 --> 21:49.876
a hand out from the old
family treasure chest,

21:49.909 --> 21:50.877
miss soon to be homeless.

21:54.581 --> 21:59.919
Speaking of, you could take
your own advice, career-wise.

21:59.952 --> 22:00.753
Please.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.021
I don't want to do this, Paul.

22:02.054 --> 22:02.822
Just save it.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.457
You have a wonderful talent.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.693
I mean, why don't you
do something with it?

22:06.726 --> 22:07.827
What about Pussy Fart?

22:07.860 --> 22:09.496
It's a punk rock
thing you dabbled in.

22:09.529 --> 22:10.597
Post punk.

22:10.630 --> 22:11.998
And I did not dabble in it.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.500
It was my full time job
for nearly two years.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.167
Stop.
You were the bass player.

22:15.201 --> 22:16.002
Meaning what?

22:16.035 --> 22:19.038
The bass is a big, ugly thing.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.207
You know, for a
girl it's unseemly.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.942
That is so fucking sexist.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.477
Oh, Jude, don't work blue.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.913
You know, cursing means you
don't know what you're talking

22:26.946 --> 22:28.748
about, said Thomas Aquinas.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.917
You know, there are a lot
of great female bassists.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.585
Kim Gordon, Kim Deal.

22:32.619 --> 22:33.553
Kim Jong Il.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.455
And I sang backup, too.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.156
Kim Jong Il.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.691
I sang backup, too.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.793
Yeah, that's not backup to me.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.629
It's like cats screaming.

22:42.662 --> 22:43.863
Jesus.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.433
You know, I noticed that
your contempt for our music

22:46.466 --> 22:49.335
didn't stop you from
banging our drummer.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.270
Why do you bring that up?

22:51.303 --> 22:53.740
It's spilled milk
under the bridge.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.141
For you.

22:55.174 --> 22:57.343
So, you're holding
up this punk band

22:57.376 --> 23:00.813
as evidence of your--
your focus on success.

23:00.847 --> 23:04.083
OK, I didn't say that we were
your close personal friends,

23:04.116 --> 23:07.620
the Beatles, but yeah,
by punk standards

23:07.654 --> 23:09.622
we were moderately successful.

23:09.656 --> 23:10.590
Yeah.

23:10.623 --> 23:11.658
Post punk.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.493
How many albums did
this band put out?

23:13.526 --> 23:15.194
That is not a fair yardstick.

23:15.227 --> 23:15.928
For the record.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.467
-One.
-What label?

23:20.500 --> 23:21.534
And an EP.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.602
What label?

23:22.635 --> 23:23.503
Chlamydia.

23:23.536 --> 23:24.637
That's not a label.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.939
Anything run out of a
garage is not a label.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.509
In publishing it's what
we call vanity press.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.143
Now you're an expert on
the publishing industry?

23:31.177 --> 23:33.045
I'm an expert on
the music business--

23:33.079 --> 23:34.113
Or is it the vanity part of it?

23:34.146 --> 23:35.281
Hey, I know the difference.

23:35.314 --> 23:36.115
Classic.

23:36.148 --> 23:38.150
When you do it, it's boutique.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.652
When I do it, it's vanity.

23:39.686 --> 23:42.254
Like the man said,
I've forgotten more

23:42.288 --> 23:44.857
about the business
than you'll ever know.

23:44.891 --> 23:45.958
Hell of a pep talk.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.560
Thank you.

23:47.594 --> 23:50.930
Yeah, boost my confidence
by insulting me?

23:50.963 --> 23:52.465
No, I'm not doing that.

23:52.499 --> 23:53.566
I'm-- I'm trying to help.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.703
Doesn't matter what
you were trying to do.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.170
Stay.

23:58.204 --> 24:01.741
You know, don't-- come on.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.042
Keep me company.

24:03.075 --> 24:03.910
I'll be dead soon.

24:23.329 --> 24:24.096
Good morning.

24:24.130 --> 24:24.897
How you doing?

24:24.931 --> 24:26.699
Good morning, Mr. Paul.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.368
Going to play golf,
in case anybody cares.

25:10.777 --> 25:13.012
So do you really think Dad
has a chance for a comeback?

25:13.045 --> 25:15.948
If you're asking me if I'm
worried about him, yeah.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.316
I'm worried.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.686
I'm worried he's going
to fall on his face.

25:19.719 --> 25:22.789
Mm, well, he's a grown up.

25:22.822 --> 25:23.856
Sort of.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.825
I mean, didn't you
find Dad's last album

25:25.858 --> 25:27.794
just a little bit twee?

25:27.827 --> 25:29.528
You know what I find twee?

25:29.562 --> 25:30.863
Using the word twee.

25:30.897 --> 25:34.333
I'm just saying we've been
down this comeback road before.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.737
Need I remind you of the
infamous reggae experiment?

25:37.770 --> 25:40.740
No, please don't.

25:40.773 --> 25:41.641
There you all are.

25:41.674 --> 25:43.342
House is completely empty.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.944
I was afraid you'd
been raptured.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.478
Hey, Alan.

25:46.512 --> 25:47.814
Hey, Jude.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.115
Oh gosh, it never gets old.

25:49.148 --> 25:49.982
You sure?

25:50.016 --> 25:51.818
Where's Paul?

25:51.851 --> 25:53.252
Playing golf.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.187
What does he play,
36 holes a day?

25:55.221 --> 25:57.724
Paul loves his holes.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.158
Where is that Lucille, anyway?

25:59.191 --> 26:00.292
Follow the smell of sulfur.

26:00.326 --> 26:01.160
Hey!

26:01.193 --> 26:02.494
David!

26:02.528 --> 26:04.130
Come over here, and let me
show you how to handle an axe.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.632
I don't want to.

26:05.665 --> 26:06.766
Come on!

26:06.799 --> 26:08.835
Please, will you-- will
you just do it for me?

26:08.868 --> 26:10.302
So what brings you out
here, anyways, Alan?

26:10.336 --> 26:13.740
I have these documents
from the DMI lawsuit

26:13.773 --> 26:15.975
that I need Paul to sign.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.309
I thought that was
settled already?

26:17.343 --> 26:19.646
No, there's two DMI lawsuits.

26:19.679 --> 26:20.613
This is a different one.

26:20.647 --> 26:22.849
You're like a
crack dealer, Alan.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.050
You've got Paul hooked.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.585
Please, your father
needs no encouragement

26:26.619 --> 26:27.654
in the legal realm.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.255
I don't need the
money, and I certainly

26:29.288 --> 26:30.522
don't need the ass pain.

26:30.556 --> 26:31.323
I know how to do it.

26:31.357 --> 26:32.759
When's he getting back?

26:32.792 --> 26:34.160
Around dinner.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.762
Do you want to stay and join us?

26:35.795 --> 26:37.163
I'm cooking.

26:37.196 --> 26:40.232
Which means she's buying food,
and Lourdes is heating it up.

26:40.266 --> 26:43.269
Why do I even need to
know how to chop wood?

26:43.302 --> 26:44.070
ALAN: What time?

26:44.103 --> 26:45.004
7:00-ish.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.138
I'm there.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.808
Gives these to your pop
when he gets back, OK?

26:48.841 --> 26:50.943
Yes.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.646
It's not gonna work like that.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.447
I mean, it's OK for practice.

26:55.481 --> 26:56.448
Hey.

26:56.482 --> 26:57.249
Psst!

26:57.283 --> 26:58.317
This is right up your alley.

26:58.350 --> 26:59.118
Trust me.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.119
Come here.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.087
What?

27:01.120 --> 27:02.288
Did you ever sleep with Alan?

27:02.321 --> 27:03.322
What?

27:03.355 --> 27:04.657
Oh, god, don't be
ridiculous, Corinne.

27:04.691 --> 27:05.457
Alan's gay.

27:05.491 --> 27:07.293
Alan is not gay.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.261
Alan is so gay.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.630
He's just of the closet
dwelling generation.

27:11.664 --> 27:14.066
Either way, did
you sleep with him?

27:14.100 --> 27:16.402
No.

27:16.435 --> 27:17.136
I already told you.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.275
Once.

27:23.309 --> 27:26.178
Jesus, Jude.

27:26.212 --> 27:31.283
I mean, I remember when
movie stars were sort of lewd.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.552
But when did he get--
when did he get sculpted?

27:33.585 --> 27:35.121
I'm just saying,
it's a tradition

27:35.154 --> 27:36.455
in music to change your name.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.157
Reinventing yourself, you know?

27:38.190 --> 27:39.792
Ask Bobby Zimmerman.

27:39.826 --> 27:44.296
I lived in London through
the '70s, right on Kings Road.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.999
Now men are being subjected to
the same unreasonable standards

27:47.033 --> 27:48.200
that women have been for years.

27:48.234 --> 27:49.435
I knew all the stars.

27:49.468 --> 27:51.938
Then when I come to Hollywood,
I want to be discrete,

27:51.971 --> 27:54.673
but we used to get around,
party, party all the time.

27:54.707 --> 27:55.908
I could tell you stories.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.376
But athletes, too.

27:57.409 --> 28:00.947
Have you seen
Rafael Nadal's arms?

28:00.980 --> 28:02.882
A lot [inaudible] those arms.

28:02.915 --> 28:05.584
You know, I used to be so
in love with [inaudible].

28:05.617 --> 28:07.854
The greatest name change in
music history is Nina Simone.

28:07.887 --> 28:08.654
David?

28:08.687 --> 28:10.222
Not at the table, plaease.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.157
Big, smart beast.

28:11.190 --> 28:11.958
Right.

28:11.991 --> 28:12.759
Alan.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.160
Ooh.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.527
California was the place.

28:15.561 --> 28:16.829
In those days-- it still is.

28:16.863 --> 28:17.629
California.

28:17.663 --> 28:20.299
Blah, blah, blah.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.201
I played tons of
gigs at the Lava.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.235
Oh, the Lava.

28:23.269 --> 28:24.370
Do not make me count to five.

28:24.403 --> 28:26.272
It was the house band,
practically-- bar tab

28:26.305 --> 28:27.406
like you could not conceive.

28:27.439 --> 28:28.207
Alan, right?

28:28.240 --> 28:29.675
Oh, yeah.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.610
Three.

28:31.643 --> 28:32.912
The Lava's going strong.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.113
Still.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.849
I tried to introduce Jude
to John and Fiona there,

28:36.883 --> 28:38.785
but of course, she said no.

28:38.818 --> 28:39.952
Fi--

28:39.986 --> 28:41.187
Why don't you bust
Corinne's balls for a while?

28:41.220 --> 28:42.922
Cause Corinne can't sing.

28:42.955 --> 28:46.192
True story, when your
father went into [inaudible],

28:46.225 --> 28:48.795
Seagram's stock
dropped 20 points.

28:48.828 --> 28:49.595
It's on Wikipedia.

28:49.628 --> 28:51.263
It's not an exaggeration.

28:51.297 --> 28:52.431
I can too sing.

28:52.464 --> 28:53.499
A little.

28:53.532 --> 28:54.666
Hey, Jude, are you
still into Nina Simone?

28:54.700 --> 28:57.469
Like, you used to listen
to her 24/7, or whatever.

28:57.503 --> 28:59.538
I used to play
ping pong with Nina.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.439
She was ferocious.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.341
Nina Simone's a god.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.643
Period, dot, end of sentence.

29:04.676 --> 29:06.078
Quick story about the Lava.

29:06.112 --> 29:07.346
Tell us.

29:07.379 --> 29:10.182
One day during the '80s,
I'm standing outside the Ivy,

29:10.216 --> 29:13.685
and this girl comes up--
young, good looking-- big rack.

29:13.719 --> 29:16.188
And she says, uh, I
have to thank you.

29:16.222 --> 29:17.056
And I'm thinking--

29:17.089 --> 29:18.024
Hey, that's not fair.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.859
When we first danced
at our wedding,

29:19.892 --> 29:22.094
it was one of my songs,
and she says, for paying

29:22.128 --> 29:23.229
for my college education.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.531
I'm Charlie Steinman's daughter.

29:25.564 --> 29:28.267
He owns the Lava Lounge.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.236
It's a true story.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.037
You can't make this up.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.304
Nope.

29:32.338 --> 29:33.840
You know, I think it slightly
invalidates your status

29:33.873 --> 29:35.574
as a recovering
alcoholic when all you do

29:35.607 --> 29:37.209
is brag about what a
big drinker you were.

29:37.243 --> 29:38.144
I'm not bragging.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.511
It's a true story,
from my memoir.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.848
And that would've been
when you were very young,

29:41.881 --> 29:43.582
and before Jude was born, right?

29:43.615 --> 29:46.152
Neither of us were
born yet, Alan.

29:46.185 --> 29:47.386
And I would have
been first, anyway.

29:47.419 --> 29:48.454
I always do that.

29:48.487 --> 29:49.655
Yeah, I always forget
that you're older.

29:49.688 --> 29:50.456
Everyone thinks that.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.558
Because of the lines.

29:52.591 --> 29:55.962
Dad, why don't you record
one of those duet albums?

29:55.995 --> 29:57.096
That would be
really good for you.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.197
I've been saying
that for years.

29:58.230 --> 29:59.832
-I've thought about that.
-Yeah.

29:59.866 --> 30:00.632
Paul, awesome idea.

30:00.666 --> 30:01.834
Yes.

30:01.868 --> 30:03.635
I can't wait to buy your
next album from Starbucks.

30:03.669 --> 30:05.704
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad.

30:05.737 --> 30:06.505
Oh.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.074
Oh, I'm sorry, Jude.

30:08.107 --> 30:10.342
God forbid Dad does
anything commercial.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.311
Hey, why don't you take a
sad song, and make it better?

30:12.344 --> 30:13.479
How about this, Paul?

30:13.512 --> 30:15.114
Why don't you just record
all your parts now,

30:15.147 --> 30:18.317
so when you're dead, Corinne can
just put out an album with you

30:18.350 --> 30:19.852
and whoever's the
flavor of the month?

30:19.886 --> 30:21.220
That is not a bad idea.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.155
I love that idea.

30:23.189 --> 30:23.956
That is a great idea.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.091
That is a terrible idea.

30:25.124 --> 30:27.459
Why not just shoot me,
throw me in the trunk,

30:27.493 --> 30:29.395
and haul me off to the boneyard.

30:29.428 --> 30:30.296
Hey, don't tempt me.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.663
Don't tempt me.

30:31.697 --> 30:34.666
I'm just saying, you don't want
to be one of those nostalgia

30:34.700 --> 30:35.868
acts, do you?

30:35.902 --> 30:37.003
Mademoiselle Super Nag.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.570
Maybe that's what
the audience wants.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.839
Hey, this is what
we're talking about.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.674
You can have all
the success-- money,

30:42.708 --> 30:46.612
fame up the wazoo-- but the
thing you cannot buy is new.

30:46.645 --> 30:49.581
I don't care who you are, sooner
or later you're going to be old

30:49.615 --> 30:52.018
news, and that's not to
say that you're less good,

30:52.051 --> 30:54.853
your fans will desert you--
thought some of them will--

30:54.887 --> 30:58.824
I'm saying you cannot
make it happen again.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.627
Not the same way.

31:01.660 --> 31:02.628
Shockingly wise.

31:02.661 --> 31:03.429
Thank you.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.531
It's also total bullshit.

31:05.564 --> 31:09.335
I mean-- I mean, just
because you're not-- sorry.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.302
But it is.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.004
Just cause you can't
be something new

31:12.038 --> 31:13.973
doesn't mean you can't
do something new.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.475
I'm doing something different.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.577
I'm recording a song
that I wrote myself.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.447
It's a different kind of new.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.150
Jude, would you clear
the plates, please?

31:24.183 --> 31:25.417
What am I, Cinderella?

31:25.451 --> 31:26.552
I got it.

31:26.585 --> 31:27.853
Finish up this flan.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.094
David.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.964
This is for you.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.565
MIss September.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.700
Check it out.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.569
She was a friend.

31:43.602 --> 31:46.505
I could tell you stories.

31:46.538 --> 31:50.676
It's an old magazine,
but, you know--

31:50.709 --> 31:52.778
Uh, OK.

31:52.811 --> 31:54.513
Thanks, Pop Pop.

31:54.546 --> 31:55.314
Don't mention it.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.018
I mean that.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.853
Don't mention it to anybody.

32:01.887 --> 32:03.589
OK, let's start
at the beginning.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.157
So the first one
was your mom, right?

32:05.191 --> 32:06.358
No.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.094
No, his first wife was the
high school sweetheart.

32:08.127 --> 32:08.894
They were only like, 18.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.762
They lived in Ho-Ho-Kus.

32:10.796 --> 32:11.763
The ho of Ho-Ho-Kus?

32:11.797 --> 32:14.433
She divorced him
before he was famous,

32:14.466 --> 32:16.969
when he was still a
Lipman, out on the road

32:17.003 --> 32:18.237
with the Moonlighters.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.739
Our mom had barely left
Bolivia when they got married.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.742
Mick Jagger had a
Latina supermodel wife,

32:23.775 --> 32:25.844
so Paul figured he
had to do the same.

32:25.877 --> 32:27.013
Wait, Jerry Hall was Latino?

32:27.046 --> 32:30.249
And the third wife-- of
course, she whose name

32:30.282 --> 32:33.119
we do not speak--
the au pair who broke

32:33.152 --> 32:34.620
up his marriage to our mom.

32:34.653 --> 32:35.988
Oh, she didn't break it up.

32:36.022 --> 32:38.057
She just happened to be
there when the roulette

32:38.090 --> 32:39.291
wheel stopped spinning.

32:39.325 --> 32:40.692
I can't even remember
the fourth one.

32:40.726 --> 32:41.493
Sure you do.

32:41.527 --> 32:42.928
Crazy cosmetics heiress.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.431
You know, the,
um-- the-- the one

32:45.464 --> 32:47.633
that he eloped with to Vegas.

32:47.666 --> 32:50.869
Wait, so then, number five?

32:50.902 --> 32:52.704
The stripper with
the 10 gallon tits.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.006
Pride of Dallas.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.407
It's Fort Worth.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.909
People down there get
upset when you mix them up.

32:57.943 --> 32:58.744
That's true.

32:58.777 --> 32:59.745
Chastity.

32:59.778 --> 33:00.546
What?

33:00.579 --> 33:01.580
Chastity was her name.

33:01.613 --> 33:02.814
That was her name.

33:02.848 --> 33:05.917
You know what's shocking,
is that marriage lasted

33:05.951 --> 33:07.119
longer than all the others.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.420
Chastity was good.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.089
I liked her.
-She was.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.623
I mean, she actually
stayed with Mom

33:11.657 --> 33:13.192
when she was in the hospital.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.827
She was there for your
mom, even up to the end.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.563
Yeah, she really was.

33:17.596 --> 33:18.397
Sure.

33:18.430 --> 33:19.798
What are we talking about?

33:19.831 --> 33:20.866
-Nothing at all.
-Nothing.

33:20.899 --> 33:21.700
Nothing.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.802
Hey, Paul, what do you think?

33:23.835 --> 33:25.003
You got another song in ya?

33:25.037 --> 33:26.072
What'll it be?

33:26.105 --> 33:26.938
Sondheim.

33:26.972 --> 33:28.107
Rodgers and Hart.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.275
-Randy Newman.
-No!

33:29.308 --> 33:30.276
Billy Joel!

33:30.309 --> 33:31.377
"Uptown Girl."

33:31.410 --> 33:34.513
Jude, come on up and
sing, like days gone by.

33:34.546 --> 33:35.314
Go on.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.115
Do it.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.283
When the world was young.

33:37.316 --> 33:38.784
Get up there.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.119
Ambush.

33:40.152 --> 33:40.986
What is this?

33:41.019 --> 33:42.488
-[inaudible].
-Come on, Jude.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.389
Do it.

33:43.422 --> 33:44.156
Come on, Mingus.

33:46.892 --> 33:47.793
Come on.

33:47.826 --> 33:48.760
Scoot over.

33:48.794 --> 33:49.828
OK.
You're gonna sit?

33:49.861 --> 33:50.562
All right.

33:54.633 --> 33:57.002
[piano music]

34:05.010 --> 34:06.978
(SINGING) I know
I'd stand in line

34:07.012 --> 34:09.181
until you think
you have the time

34:09.215 --> 34:11.850
to spend an evening with me.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.356
And if we go
someplace to dance, I

34:17.389 --> 34:21.260
know that there's a chance
you won't be leaving with me.

34:24.330 --> 34:28.734
And afterwards we'd drop
into a quiet little old place

34:28.766 --> 34:31.170
and have a drink or two.

34:34.239 --> 34:37.976
And then I'd go and spoil it
all by saying something stupid,

34:38.009 --> 34:39.878
like I love you.

34:43.449 --> 34:47.853
I'd practice every day to
find some clever lines to say

34:47.886 --> 34:50.255
to make the meaning come true.

34:53.324 --> 34:57.729
But then I think I'll wait
until the evening gets late,

34:57.763 --> 34:59.631
and I'm alone with you.

35:02.701 --> 35:05.637
The time is right, your
perfume fills my head,

35:05.671 --> 35:09.508
the stars get red, and
oh, the night so blue.

35:12.578 --> 35:15.814
And then I go and spoil
it all by saying something

35:15.847 --> 35:18.684
stupid, like I love you.

35:22.754 --> 35:23.722
Woo!

35:23.755 --> 35:24.890
Dad.

35:24.923 --> 35:25.624
Woo!

35:41.540 --> 35:44.643
(SINGING) The time is right,
your perfume fills my head,

35:44.676 --> 35:50.382
the stars get red, and
oh, the night so blue.

35:50.416 --> 35:55.421
And then I'd go and spoil it
all by saying something stupid,

35:55.454 --> 35:56.855
like, I love you.

36:00.426 --> 36:01.827
I love you.

36:04.896 --> 36:09.335
I love you.

36:09.368 --> 36:10.336
Woo!

36:10.369 --> 36:12.338
That was Paul Lombard, guys!

36:12.371 --> 36:13.305
Dad.

36:13.339 --> 36:14.806
Paul Lombard!

36:14.840 --> 36:16.808
God.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.477
Pauly, Pauly.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.278
Wonderful, Paul.

36:19.311 --> 36:20.011
Woo!

36:24.816 --> 36:26.752
He really can't
help himself, can he?

36:34.260 --> 36:36.228
You know, I really don't want
to be another person telling

36:36.262 --> 36:37.095
you how to live your life.

36:37.128 --> 36:38.264
And I appreciate that, Alan.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.332
Then why don't you let
me help you out a bit?

36:40.366 --> 36:42.200
Do you really want to
be somebody recording

36:42.234 --> 36:44.002
jingles the rest of your life?

36:44.035 --> 36:46.171
Maybe.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.806
Don't be coy.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.308
I mean, it's fine
if you want to,

36:49.341 --> 36:53.779
but I guess that's what
I'm asking, is do you?

36:53.812 --> 36:55.481
Why don't you let me help you?

36:55.514 --> 36:57.549
Because I can take
care of myself.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.351
Can ya?

36:59.385 --> 37:01.219
Don't be a dick, Alan.

37:01.253 --> 37:02.321
Let me make a couple calls.

37:02.354 --> 37:04.055
You know, set up some
meetings, and let's

37:04.089 --> 37:05.724
see if we can avoid you
having to move in with Paul.

37:08.727 --> 37:12.798
If you want to do
that, I can't stop you.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.032
But I'm not asking you.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.167
It's all me.

37:16.201 --> 37:16.902
All my idea.

37:20.306 --> 37:22.874
MAN ON PHONE: Did you call
my home number last night?

37:22.908 --> 37:23.809
Well, yeah, but I--

37:23.842 --> 37:25.377
MAN ON PHONE: Are
you crazy, Jude?

37:25.411 --> 37:26.512
I--

37:26.545 --> 37:28.113
MAN ON PHONE: My wife's
not an idiot, you know?

37:28.146 --> 37:29.881
She is a lot of things,
but she's not an idiot.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.287
I couldn't get through
to you on your cell.

37:39.024 --> 37:40.892
I needed to talk to you.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.294
MAN ON PHONE: Where
are you, anyway?

37:42.328 --> 37:44.330
I'm at my dad's place.

37:44.363 --> 37:47.232
MAN ON PHONE: Now, what the
hell are you doing there?

37:47.265 --> 37:49.968
Ugh, it's a long story.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.403
MAN ON PHONE: We
talked about this.

37:51.437 --> 37:53.705
It's not a healthy
environment for you.

37:53.739 --> 37:55.607
When can I see you?

37:55.641 --> 37:56.408
MAN ON PHONE: Soon.

37:56.442 --> 37:59.144
I promise.

37:59.177 --> 38:00.211
You're the one I
want to be with.

38:00.245 --> 38:03.382
I never want you to doubt that.

38:03.415 --> 38:05.116
What about this weekend?

38:05.150 --> 38:09.254
MAN ON PHONE: Jude,
you're pushing again.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.689
It's not that easy.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.491
All right, when will you know?

38:12.524 --> 38:14.326
MAN ON PHONE: I'm
doing the best I can.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.527
Work's a disaster.

38:15.561 --> 38:17.563
Hank's breaking
my balls as usual.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.531
Chloe's waiting to hear about
colleges, Joel's playing

38:19.565 --> 38:20.899
hockey for two different teams.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.267
I got a lot of
demand on my time,

38:22.300 --> 38:25.404
not to mention you jeopardizing
everything by calling my house.

38:29.341 --> 38:31.777
Look, I'll figure
something out, all right?

38:31.810 --> 38:34.680
I promise.

38:34.713 --> 38:37.683
You trust me, don't you?

38:37.716 --> 38:39.084
Yeah.

38:39.117 --> 38:40.519
Of course.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.654
MAN ON PHONE: We both kinda knew
the deal when we got into this,

38:42.688 --> 38:43.389
didn't we?

38:46.224 --> 38:48.059
OK, I gotta go.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.961
I'll call you tomorrow.

38:49.995 --> 38:50.962
Bye.

38:50.996 --> 38:51.697
Bye.

38:56.468 --> 38:57.969
I was talking to Charlie
Manson the other day.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.305
He says, is it hot in
here, or am I crazy?

39:08.547 --> 39:12.984
(SINGING) Miss Tallie,
they say you are going.

39:13.018 --> 39:18.490
We will miss your bright
eyes and sweet smile.

39:18.524 --> 39:24.496
Oh, they say you are taking the
sunshine that has brightened

39:24.530 --> 39:27.633
our path for a while.

39:27.666 --> 39:28.366
Yeah!

39:40.178 --> 39:41.513
Why do you give him
that chicory crap?

39:41.547 --> 39:42.981
You know what Dr. Remcor said.

39:43.014 --> 39:43.949
Yep.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.283
I'll see you tonight
at your dad's.

39:49.421 --> 39:50.121
All right, sweetheart.

39:53.525 --> 39:54.726
Mommy's off.

39:54.760 --> 39:55.694
I'll see you later?

39:59.698 --> 40:00.599
Bye, guys.

40:09.274 --> 40:11.209
(SINGING) And if we
go someplace to dance,

40:11.242 --> 40:14.480
I know there's a chance you
won't be leaving with me.

40:18.917 --> 40:22.854
And afterwards, we hop
into a tiny little boat,

40:22.888 --> 40:24.590
and have a drink or two.

40:27.726 --> 40:31.497
And then I go and spoil
it all by saying something

40:31.530 --> 40:33.331
stupid, like I love you.

40:36.334 --> 40:37.803
I love you.

40:41.873 --> 40:46.311
I love you.

40:46.344 --> 40:47.378
Come on, move!

40:58.456 --> 40:59.357
[knocking]

41:01.927 --> 41:03.328
[knocking]

41:05.430 --> 41:07.633
TIM: It's Tim!

41:07.666 --> 41:10.702
Can I come in?

41:10.736 --> 41:11.503
I'm so--

41:11.537 --> 41:12.604
It's your dad.

41:12.638 --> 41:13.304
[screaming]

41:16.708 --> 41:20.045
Yo, everybody
downstairs, chop chop.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.179
You all right?

41:21.212 --> 41:22.247
Gather round.

41:22.280 --> 41:24.049
What's going on?

41:24.082 --> 41:25.116
I have news.

41:25.150 --> 41:25.917
What?

41:25.951 --> 41:27.452
Alan called.

41:27.485 --> 41:30.155
He says the top guys at
Jupiter heard the master

41:30.188 --> 41:31.957
of "When I Live My Life."

41:31.990 --> 41:33.258
They think it's gonna be big.

41:33.291 --> 41:34.225
Huge.

41:34.259 --> 41:35.794
They think it's
gonna be a huge hit.

41:35.827 --> 41:36.795
What?
I didn't know.

41:36.828 --> 41:37.663
It's his comeback.

41:37.696 --> 41:38.463
You're fucking dead.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.497
It's not a comeback.

41:39.531 --> 41:42.333
I never went away.

41:42.367 --> 41:44.035
Yeah, they got mea gig.

41:44.069 --> 41:49.975
Test run live, special guest for
an act called The Flaming Lips.

41:50.008 --> 41:53.244
Wait-- you're opening
for The Flaming Lips?

41:53.278 --> 41:54.646
That is huge.

41:54.680 --> 41:55.581
That's ridiculous.

41:55.614 --> 41:56.548
Flaming Lips.

41:56.582 --> 41:57.448
They're terrific.

41:57.482 --> 41:58.516
I love them.

41:58.550 --> 42:00.418
OK, for starters,
it's called The Flaming

42:00.451 --> 42:02.954
Lips, not "The Flaming Lips."

42:02.988 --> 42:03.789
The Flaming Lips.

42:03.822 --> 42:05.123
Flaming Lips.

42:05.156 --> 42:06.057
Flaming Lips.

42:06.091 --> 42:08.860
Do you even know
this band at all?

42:08.894 --> 42:09.761
No.

42:09.795 --> 42:11.563
OK, let me fill you in.

42:11.597 --> 42:14.666
The Flaming Lips, their
fans are not your fans.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.334
Like, trust me-- not at all.

42:16.367 --> 42:17.903
If they're asking you
to open up for them,

42:17.936 --> 42:20.572
they're doing it out of some
sort of ironic hipster goof.

42:20.606 --> 42:22.473
Jude, beware the
green eyed monster.

42:32.718 --> 42:36.722
I can't believe you actually
like living out here.

42:36.755 --> 42:38.790
You know, it's not so bad.

42:38.824 --> 42:42.761
It's been like, five years now.

42:42.794 --> 42:44.462
You know, Corinne likes
to be near her dad,

42:44.495 --> 42:46.898
and then we get the pool.

42:52.103 --> 42:53.639
You don't miss the city?

42:53.672 --> 42:55.941
Uh, yeah.

42:55.974 --> 42:57.275
Hustle and bustle.

42:57.308 --> 42:59.711
I miss that, but Corinne's
there, like, two days a week,

42:59.745 --> 43:01.947
and then I can work
from home, so I get

43:01.980 --> 43:03.048
to spend more time with David.

43:03.081 --> 43:03.782
You know?

43:06.584 --> 43:09.921
It's probably just a phase.

43:09.955 --> 43:10.922
David, I mean.

43:10.956 --> 43:11.723
Yeah.

43:11.757 --> 43:12.691
Yeah.

43:12.724 --> 43:14.525
Just like, eight
years and counting.

43:19.464 --> 43:21.633
You do a good job with him.

43:21.667 --> 43:22.567
Mm-hm.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.003
Seriously.

43:25.036 --> 43:25.737
I've been watching you.

43:29.641 --> 43:31.943
Good lord, it's
Lee Harvey Oswald.

43:31.977 --> 43:32.911
Jude, come on.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.212
Take a ride.

43:34.245 --> 43:35.346
I'm busy.

43:35.380 --> 43:36.214
Yeah, me too.

43:36.247 --> 43:37.015
Come on.

43:37.048 --> 43:37.816
I'll be dead soon.

43:46.758 --> 43:49.795
You and Corinne, you doing good?

43:49.828 --> 43:52.030
Same as it ever was.

43:52.063 --> 43:53.431
Why?

43:53.464 --> 43:56.067
You're not carrying a
torch for Tim still, right?

43:56.101 --> 43:58.937
God, Paul.

43:58.970 --> 44:00.371
That was, like, 100 years ago.

44:00.405 --> 44:02.908
Give me a break.

44:02.941 --> 44:05.643
Don't get me wrong, I
love Tim, but he's not

44:05.677 --> 44:07.545
the sharpest Swiss army knife.

44:07.578 --> 44:11.582
Well, that is Corinne's
problem, isn't it?

44:11.616 --> 44:13.451
This song, it's such a classic.

44:13.484 --> 44:15.486
It is bona fide classic.

44:15.520 --> 44:19.390
You know, the term is
overused, but is a classic.

44:19.424 --> 44:25.463
It takes me back to an amazing
weekend I spent in Acapulco

44:25.496 --> 44:27.332
with a starlet who
shall remain nameless.

44:27.365 --> 44:28.666
Can you please
save your stories

44:28.700 --> 44:30.936
of your prehistoric conquests
for your geriatric friends

44:30.969 --> 44:32.403
at the country club?

44:32.437 --> 44:35.140
Besides, a fan's a friend.

44:35.173 --> 44:38.243
I owe you a phone
call, you devil.

44:38.276 --> 44:39.745
You realize that it's
Van Morrison, right?

44:42.914 --> 44:45.316
You know, it's a shame
that you and this starlet

44:45.350 --> 44:48.754
that shall remain nameless
didn't make a go of it.

44:48.787 --> 44:51.022
Could have spared us your
marriage to the wicked witch

44:51.056 --> 44:52.457
of the Upper West Side.

44:52.490 --> 44:54.392
You could go easier on Lucille.

44:54.425 --> 44:56.494
What have you got
against her, anyway?

44:56.527 --> 44:58.363
Nothing.

44:58.396 --> 45:01.566
I happen to know that you and
Corinne call her the devil.

45:01.599 --> 45:02.934
Only affectionately.

45:02.968 --> 45:04.936
You think she's a
gold digger, right?

45:04.970 --> 45:06.304
Not a very good one, obviously.

45:12.577 --> 45:13.278
Pull.

45:17.582 --> 45:19.717
Stupid clay pigeons.

45:19.751 --> 45:22.053
I know you think I'm
nagging, but I can't stand

45:22.087 --> 45:23.588
to see potential go to waste.

45:23.621 --> 45:24.455
You could be great.

45:24.489 --> 45:26.591
Still could be really something.

45:26.624 --> 45:28.259
You're gifted.

45:28.293 --> 45:29.527
Whoa, be careful with that gun.

45:29.560 --> 45:30.261
God.

45:32.831 --> 45:34.966
There's nothing more
common than wasted talent,

45:35.000 --> 45:36.301
said Thomas Aquinas.

45:36.334 --> 45:38.804
I don't think Saint Thomas
Aquinas ever said that, but OK.

45:38.837 --> 45:39.537
Pull.

45:44.375 --> 45:45.176
Tick tock, Jude.

45:45.210 --> 45:48.013
You know what I'm talking about.

45:48.046 --> 45:50.481
You're pushing 30.

45:50.515 --> 45:51.682
31.

45:51.716 --> 45:52.417
Pull.

45:55.386 --> 45:56.855
Maybe I don't want
to be a singer.

45:56.888 --> 45:59.224
Maybe I don't want your life.

45:59.257 --> 46:01.993
I was thinking of becoming
a barista, actually.

46:02.027 --> 46:04.429
Somebody who pours seven
dollar cups of coffee,

46:04.462 --> 46:05.864
it's not a career.

46:05.897 --> 46:06.597
Pull.

46:09.300 --> 46:10.001
[gunshot]

46:10.902 --> 46:11.970
Stupid clay pigeon.

46:12.003 --> 46:14.172
Sir, are you sure this
thing is calibrated?

46:17.408 --> 46:19.845
I only want the best for you.

46:19.878 --> 46:21.246
Do you?

46:21.279 --> 46:23.681
You sure you're not just trying
to live vicariously through me?

46:23.714 --> 46:25.750
If I wanted to
live vicariously,

46:25.783 --> 46:26.751
it wouldn't be through you.

46:29.454 --> 46:30.155
Pull.

46:35.560 --> 46:38.196
You really are an asshole,
you know that, Paul?

46:47.973 --> 46:50.508
You know, I met
the Dalai Lama once,

46:50.541 --> 46:53.444
and I happened to be cooking
hot dogs at the time.

46:53.478 --> 46:56.247
I said, what do you want?

46:56.281 --> 46:59.817
And he said, make me
one with everything.

46:59.851 --> 47:05.723
[laughter] The Dalai Lama,
make me one with everything.

47:05.756 --> 47:06.724
Huh?

47:06.757 --> 47:07.859
I want to jump out of this car.

47:07.893 --> 47:08.960
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

47:08.994 --> 47:10.161
I want to kill--

47:10.195 --> 47:13.498
Listen, I know how you
feel about the Dalai Lama.

47:13.531 --> 47:17.168
You know, to me he's just a guy.

47:17.202 --> 47:18.369
What does he know
about show business?

47:51.136 --> 47:53.504
[chatter on radio]

48:20.231 --> 48:21.032
Paul!

48:21.066 --> 48:23.001
Are you coming upstairs soon?

48:23.034 --> 48:23.935
In a minute.

48:45.690 --> 48:46.457
Hey.

48:46.491 --> 48:47.758
You busy?

48:47.792 --> 48:49.394
Seriously, Tim, I don't have
the brain space right now.

48:49.427 --> 48:50.928
No, no, no, no.
Come on, not like that.

48:50.962 --> 48:51.963
Let's just go for a ride.

49:04.442 --> 49:06.011
An open mic night?

49:06.044 --> 49:06.811
No way.

49:06.844 --> 49:07.612
No, no, no, no, no.

49:07.645 --> 49:08.846
It's not an open mic night.

49:08.879 --> 49:11.382
This is-- this is, uh,
officially an intervention.

49:11.416 --> 49:13.384
I'm not a 15 year old
on YouTube, all right?

49:13.418 --> 49:14.185
I'm a professional.

49:14.219 --> 49:15.786
[clucking]

49:18.356 --> 49:20.758
Give me that.

49:20.791 --> 49:25.230
I'm doing this just to make
you stop making that noise.

49:25.263 --> 49:28.566
So, let's bring out our
next performer, Jules Lipton.

49:32.037 --> 49:36.141
Yes, uh, actually
that's Jude Lipman.

49:36.174 --> 49:36.874
June Litton.

49:39.644 --> 49:40.945
Whatever.

49:40.978 --> 49:46.117
Um, yeah, this is, uh-- this
is a song that I, um, wrote.

49:52.423 --> 49:54.825
[music playing]

50:05.370 --> 50:09.840
(SINGING) Oh, this
heart is a foolish one.

50:09.874 --> 50:13.811
It's never worked right.

50:13.844 --> 50:19.284
So loudly it keeps me
awake in the night,

50:19.317 --> 50:25.256
and it forces me out of bed.

50:25.290 --> 50:28.759
Pacing my floor instead.

50:28.793 --> 50:34.732
Longing for things to
which it has no right,

50:34.765 --> 50:45.676
and no whiskey or wine can it
sway my poor, ludicrous heart.

50:45.710 --> 50:56.154
It just rattles the bars,
rattles the bars of its cage.

50:56.187 --> 51:04.862
Oh, and sometimes it feels
like it must weigh 100 pounds.

51:04.895 --> 51:10.335
Sometimes it's light, so
much lighter than air.

51:10.368 --> 51:18.809
But always it wants too much,
needs too much, feels too much.

51:18.843 --> 51:24.749
Loves so much more than
just one heart can bear,

51:24.782 --> 51:35.226
and sometimes, in a hideous
rage, yeah, my ludicrous heart,

51:35.260 --> 51:44.602
it just rattles the
bars, rattles the bars,

51:44.635 --> 51:49.540
rattles the bars of its cage.

51:49.574 --> 51:51.942
[applause]

52:09.494 --> 52:10.261
Wow.

52:10.295 --> 52:12.497
It's a gorgeous night, huh?

52:12.530 --> 52:14.332
There's supposed to be a
lunar eclipse next week.

52:18.769 --> 52:23.341
I'm having an affair
with a married man.

52:23.374 --> 52:24.309
Oh, yeah?

52:24.342 --> 52:26.711
Who is he?

52:26.744 --> 52:29.880
Just some guy I met at the gym.

52:29.914 --> 52:34.419
He owns a bunch
of KFCs in Jersey.

52:34.452 --> 52:37.322
How old is he?

52:37.355 --> 52:38.789
I don't know.

52:38.823 --> 52:40.591
Why?

52:40.625 --> 52:41.592
I don't know.

52:41.626 --> 52:43.060
Just curious.

52:43.093 --> 52:44.061
I don't know.

52:44.094 --> 52:45.963
Like, 50?

52:49.567 --> 52:54.205
OK-- all right, I lied.

52:54.239 --> 52:57.775
He doesn't own any KFCs.

52:57.808 --> 52:59.710
He is my analyst.

53:04.549 --> 53:08.819
Well, I at least thought
that would get a reaction.

53:08.853 --> 53:12.923
I've been around this
family for too long.

53:12.957 --> 53:14.091
You know what I've
never understood?

53:17.528 --> 53:18.929
How the hell you
ended up with Corinne.

53:18.963 --> 53:20.231
Do you know what
I've never understood?

53:20.265 --> 53:22.467
Why do you hate her so much?

53:22.500 --> 53:25.870
I get that you guys are
different, and that's fine,

53:25.903 --> 53:27.938
but she's not a terrible person.

53:27.972 --> 53:29.574
I mean, seriously.

53:29.607 --> 53:33.378
She's completely kind, and fun.

53:33.411 --> 53:34.979
Fun?

53:35.012 --> 53:37.682
OK, I'll concede you kind before
I'm gonna concede you fun.

53:37.715 --> 53:39.250
And even kind is a stretch.

53:39.284 --> 53:40.418
She participates
in the community,

53:40.451 --> 53:41.752
she cares about the environment.

53:41.786 --> 53:42.820
And Hitler loved his dog.

53:42.853 --> 53:44.154
OK that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

53:44.188 --> 53:45.956
I mean, I get that you
don't like Corinne,

53:45.990 --> 53:47.292
but then when you
compare her to Hitler,

53:47.325 --> 53:48.893
you're not really making
your case, you know?

53:48.926 --> 53:50.261
It was a joke.

53:50.295 --> 53:52.330
You're sounding hysterical,
and like, it's really awkward

53:52.363 --> 53:53.631
for me too, do you know?

53:53.664 --> 53:54.599
Do you ever consider that?

53:54.632 --> 53:57.335
It gets fucking old.

53:57.368 --> 53:59.470
I'm sorry.

53:59.504 --> 54:03.841
I am, I'm-- I'm sorry
for you, but-- Tim.

54:07.011 --> 54:08.713
This shit between me
and Corinne is old.

54:11.949 --> 54:14.151
Don't you have issues with her?

54:14.184 --> 54:15.920
I mean, come on, you must.

54:15.953 --> 54:17.221
Of course I do.

54:17.254 --> 54:22.126
But you don't get to choose
who you fall in love with.

54:22.159 --> 54:23.961
Sure you do.

54:23.994 --> 54:26.397
What you don't get to choose
is who loves you back.

54:33.103 --> 54:35.239
I mean, you think
if, um-- if we'd

54:35.272 --> 54:37.608
stayed together all those
years ago, we'd have,

54:37.642 --> 54:39.076
uh-- we would have worked?

54:42.547 --> 54:44.749
If we'd just tried
a little bit harder.

54:44.782 --> 54:46.884
If the timing had
been different.

54:46.917 --> 54:48.986
If we'd just been a
little bit more mature.

54:52.056 --> 54:53.424
If Corinne didn't come along?

54:53.458 --> 54:54.224
Yeah.

54:54.258 --> 54:55.025
No.

54:55.059 --> 54:56.193
Maybe.

54:56.226 --> 55:00.030
My aunt had a dick,
should be my uncle.

55:00.064 --> 55:03.334
Jude the vulgarian.

55:03.368 --> 55:04.268
Some things never change.

55:18.349 --> 55:21.852
What are you--
what are you doing?

55:21.886 --> 55:24.622
I, um-- I--

55:24.655 --> 55:25.490
I--

55:25.523 --> 55:26.391
I'm--

55:26.424 --> 55:28.926
I'm married to your sister, OK?

55:28.959 --> 55:30.127
What's wrong with you?

55:30.160 --> 55:30.928
I'm sorry.

55:30.961 --> 55:32.062
I mean, you need some help.

55:32.096 --> 55:34.264
You need help, and
you need to not screw

55:34.298 --> 55:35.533
the help when you get the help.

55:39.504 --> 55:40.971
I'm sorry.

55:41.005 --> 55:42.039
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

55:42.072 --> 55:42.840
Just--

55:42.873 --> 55:43.741
No, it was no big deal.

55:43.774 --> 55:44.609
It was no big deal.

55:44.642 --> 55:45.843
I overreacted.
That was--

55:45.876 --> 55:46.377
I gotta go.
Sorry.

55:46.411 --> 55:47.177
It was nothing.

55:47.211 --> 55:48.012
Please don't run away.

55:48.045 --> 55:49.213
Come on.

55:49.246 --> 55:49.947
Wait!

56:44.769 --> 56:47.337
Lourdes, you are the best.

56:47.371 --> 56:49.339
Good to my house.

56:49.373 --> 56:51.876
I shall return anon.

56:51.909 --> 56:54.344
I'm off to my [inaudible],
in case anybody cares.

56:57.582 --> 56:58.883
ALAN (OVER PHONE): OK.

56:58.916 --> 57:01.752
You are all set to meet Marty
Sedgwick tomorrow morning

57:01.786 --> 57:03.387
at 10:00 AM in the city.

57:03.420 --> 57:06.156
Who knows who you are, he
knows who your father is.

57:06.190 --> 57:07.658
Most importantly, he
knows you can sing,

57:07.692 --> 57:10.628
cause I sent him
some of your stuff.

57:10.661 --> 57:16.166
Now, listen to me-- Marty is a
real gut feeling kind of guy,

57:16.200 --> 57:17.502
OK?

57:17.535 --> 57:20.004
He fancies himself to be a
very sharp judge of character.

57:20.037 --> 57:22.006
What the hell is that
supposed to mean, Alan?

57:22.039 --> 57:27.011
I'm just saying, be
your good, old fashioned,

57:27.044 --> 57:29.213
charming, on time self.

57:36.921 --> 57:38.422
I feel bad about this.

57:38.455 --> 57:40.157
What are you, a martyr?

57:40.190 --> 57:42.159
All I did was put
my foot in the door.

57:42.192 --> 57:44.862
Nobody gets anywhere in
life without a little help

57:44.895 --> 57:46.296
every now and then.

57:46.330 --> 57:49.567
So you caught a bit of luck
being Paul Lombard's daughter.

57:49.600 --> 57:52.036
I don't need to tell you
that being close to that guy,

57:52.069 --> 57:56.040
it ain't necessarily
a game of Frisbee.

57:56.073 --> 57:58.709
So let's just call this
fair compensation, OK?

58:04.114 --> 58:06.016
Jude?

58:06.050 --> 58:08.418
Jude?

58:08.452 --> 58:09.887
Jude?

58:09.920 --> 58:10.621
Jude?

58:29.306 --> 58:29.974
Have a good round?

58:35.212 --> 58:36.213
What are you doing?

58:36.246 --> 58:37.081
I was going over there.

58:37.114 --> 58:40.284
I had to make a stop.

58:40.317 --> 58:44.822
God, you are completely
and utterly shameless.

58:44.855 --> 58:46.023
Your car is right here.

58:46.056 --> 58:47.524
Anyone could see you
were having an affair.

58:47.558 --> 58:49.660
What are you doing, driving
around, looking for my car?

58:49.694 --> 58:50.394
I had a meeting.

58:53.263 --> 58:55.733
Jesus, Paul, I should have
known something was up.

58:55.766 --> 58:57.334
All this golf in the winter.

58:57.367 --> 58:58.669
How could you do
this to Lucille?

58:58.703 --> 58:59.904
You hate her.

58:59.937 --> 59:03.708
Is there a woman I know
that you haven't slept with?

59:03.741 --> 59:07.444
My-- my friends, my teachers.

59:07.477 --> 59:08.178
Lourdes?

59:11.949 --> 59:13.450
You slept with Lourdes?

59:13.483 --> 59:14.318
A lifetime ago.

59:14.351 --> 59:15.419
Are you kidding me?

59:15.452 --> 59:17.454
Look, I'm not saying
the father of the year

59:17.487 --> 59:19.289
people misplaced my trophy.

59:19.323 --> 59:20.490
Unbelievable.

59:20.524 --> 59:23.460
Face it, this is about me
cheating on your mother.

59:23.493 --> 59:25.763
Of course it's about
you cheating on Mom!

59:25.796 --> 59:26.764
What do you blame me for?

59:26.797 --> 59:29.399
Bad parent, bad
husband, bad judgment.

59:29.433 --> 59:30.901
Check, check, check.

59:30.935 --> 59:32.903
It's the birthdays
that you missed,

59:32.937 --> 59:35.840
it's telling Mrs. Croom not
to cast me in the school play

59:35.873 --> 59:37.541
because I'd forget all my lines.

59:37.574 --> 59:40.911
It's the graduation you missed
because you were in rehab.

59:40.945 --> 59:42.146
I went to rehab for you guys.

59:42.179 --> 59:43.714
It is a comment you made
to the New York Times

59:43.748 --> 59:45.249
about talent not
running in the family.

59:45.282 --> 59:46.216
I'm not to blame for every--

59:46.250 --> 59:47.618
Thanks a lot for that--

59:47.652 --> 59:49.654
Bump you've had in your life,
much as you want to think so.

59:49.687 --> 59:51.989
That's great, Paul.

59:52.022 --> 59:56.761
Take no responsibility
for the way that you,

59:56.794 --> 01:00:03.467
your life, that your
behavior has fucked me up.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:04.935
Didn't do that to Corinne.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:37.001
What's the matter with her now?

01:00:37.034 --> 01:00:38.769
She's nuts.

01:00:38.803 --> 01:00:40.537
Pain in the ass.

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:41.538
Where's Lucille?

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:43.207
You know, maybe if
I acted that way,

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.110
you'd spend this much
time and energy on me.

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.678
Corinne, I don't
have time right

01:00:47.712 --> 01:00:49.479
now for two bat shit daughters.

01:00:49.513 --> 01:00:51.615
You're supposed to
be the stable one.

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:54.819
Do you know where Lucille is?

01:00:54.852 --> 01:00:57.187
She's getting a mani-pedi.

01:00:57.221 --> 01:00:58.188
Not here?

01:00:58.222 --> 01:01:00.991
Not here.

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:01.726
OK.

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:21.345
Don't tell Lucille.

01:01:24.281 --> 01:01:26.250
It'd destroy her.

01:01:26.283 --> 01:01:28.986
I'm not a snitch.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:31.722
If you want to keep living
your life like this,

01:01:31.756 --> 01:01:33.090
be my fucking guest.

01:01:36.593 --> 01:01:39.096
You have a finely tuned
sense of injustice, Jude,

01:01:39.129 --> 01:01:42.566
and that's good, but you
should get out of your sandbox

01:01:42.599 --> 01:01:43.734
once in a while.

01:01:43.768 --> 01:01:45.502
I'm not a villain.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.204
You don't see it.

01:01:47.237 --> 01:01:49.840
You don't see the
destruction that you cause.

01:01:49.874 --> 01:01:53.310
Or at least you pretend not
to, so you can sleep at night.

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:05.355
You're like this
big, overgrown child,

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:09.593
who just rampages through
life, doing whatever

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:13.163
the fuck his heart desires.

01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:14.999
That's terrible.

01:02:15.032 --> 01:02:19.870
And I know it's standard new age
procedure to blame your parents

01:02:19.904 --> 01:02:24.341
for your troubles, and I take my
shame of blame for my problems,

01:02:24.374 --> 01:02:26.076
and yours too,
but you can't make

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:28.645
me a stooge for
everything that makes

01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:31.548
you unhappy about yourself.

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:34.451
You should thank me.

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:35.986
Thank you?

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:37.955
You're welcome.

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:41.358
Thank you for what?

01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:46.430
For giving you a get
out of blame free card.

01:02:46.463 --> 01:02:48.465
No matter what you
do, you can shrug it

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:51.368
off and blame it on me.

01:02:51.401 --> 01:02:54.404
You think I'm a child.

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:55.139
Maybe.

01:02:58.242 --> 01:03:00.344
You're an adult, Jude.

01:03:00.377 --> 01:03:02.646
Why don't you grow up?

01:03:02.679 --> 01:03:04.614
Stop blaming everybody
for your mess.

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:35.445
Hey.

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:38.415
Did it hurt?

01:03:38.448 --> 01:03:40.417
What?

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:44.488
When you fell out of Heaven.

01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:49.026
Not enough o's in smooth
for you, huh, buddy?

01:03:49.059 --> 01:03:52.196
I'm Josh.

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:54.031
I'm Jude.

01:03:54.064 --> 01:03:56.233
Hey, Jude.

01:03:56.266 --> 01:03:57.101
That's clever.

01:04:00.037 --> 01:04:01.038
You a year rounder?

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:02.606
I haven't seen you
in here before.

01:04:02.639 --> 01:04:08.913
Yeah, I've been on a little
vacation from booze lately.

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:12.917
It's good to be back.

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:19.189
You know, I could give you a
whole line, turn on the charm,

01:04:19.223 --> 01:04:21.825
play the game, but I
don't want to do that.

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:25.029
You look like a special lady.

01:04:25.062 --> 01:04:26.730
Somebody that I'd
like to get to know.

01:04:26.763 --> 01:04:27.797
So what do you say?

01:04:27.831 --> 01:04:29.799
I've got a better idea.

01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:31.768
How about you and me
pretend, just for a second,

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:35.105
that we're not both
completely full of shit?

01:04:35.139 --> 01:04:35.906
OK.

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:37.975
Sure.

01:04:38.008 --> 01:04:40.644
I get it.

01:04:40.677 --> 01:04:43.580
It's funny-- you meet
so many people, who have

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:47.551
these strategies that they use.

01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:49.553
Tricks, you know?

01:04:49.586 --> 01:04:50.587
Sometimes it's hard to know--

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.556
That's all very
fascinating, Jake.

01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:53.490
Uh, it's Josh.

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:54.891
That's all very
fascinating, Josh.

01:04:54.925 --> 01:04:56.893
Would you like to stay here and
keep working on your material,

01:04:56.927 --> 01:05:00.530
or would you rather go get
your brains fucked out?

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:01.431
Brains out, please.

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:11.208
[phone ringing]

01:05:25.956 --> 01:05:27.124
Hello?

01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:29.159
WOMAN ON PHONE: I'm trying
to reach Jude Lipman?

01:05:29.193 --> 01:05:30.527
Eh.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.096
WOMAN ON PHONE: I'm calling
form Marty Sedgwick's office.

01:05:32.129 --> 01:05:35.132
You had an appointment with
Marty at 10:00 this morning?

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:36.333
Oh, fuck!

01:05:36.366 --> 01:05:37.801
WOMAN ON PHONE: Sorry?

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:39.003
Marty's on a very
tight schedule.

01:05:39.036 --> 01:05:41.171
We weren't sure if you
got delayed, or something?

01:05:41.205 --> 01:05:43.740
Yeah, my-- my car broke
down halfway into the city.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.475
I was- I was coming
from Long Island.

01:05:45.509 --> 01:05:47.644
Uh, the tow truck just
got here, actually,

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:50.981
and it looks like I can be
there in, like, two hours.

01:05:51.015 --> 01:05:52.049
Is that OK?

01:05:52.082 --> 01:05:53.117
WOMAN ON PHONE: I'm
sorry, this morning

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:55.119
was the only time Marty had.

01:05:55.152 --> 01:05:56.720
I was told this was
a special favor he

01:05:56.753 --> 01:05:57.854
was doing for Alan Sternberg?

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:03.793
You could try having Mr.
Sternberg call again.

01:06:03.827 --> 01:06:04.594
No.

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:08.065
Um-- you know what?

01:06:08.098 --> 01:06:12.636
Um, that's OK.

01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:13.370
Never mind.

01:07:15.065 --> 01:07:15.932
Just do this.

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:17.401
Just do it.

01:07:17.434 --> 01:07:19.836
Get it over with.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.639
You got yourself here,
you asked for it.

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:28.112
Just do it.

01:07:28.145 --> 01:07:29.413
Get out of your own way.

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:31.081
Just do it.

01:07:31.115 --> 01:07:32.282
Go right through it.

01:07:32.316 --> 01:07:33.750
You understand?

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:37.654
It's a-- it's a bit pricey.

01:07:37.687 --> 01:07:38.488
No, no, of course.

01:07:38.522 --> 01:07:39.289
Of course.

01:07:39.323 --> 01:07:40.090
You're right.

01:07:40.124 --> 01:07:41.658
What's up with you and Paul?

01:07:41.691 --> 01:07:43.327
What do you mean?

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:44.461
What do I mean?

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:46.596
There's this big cold
front between the two

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:48.232
of you, is what I mean.

01:07:48.265 --> 01:07:51.601
Well, this'll shock you,
but we got in a fight.

01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:53.870
A big one.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:56.740
So that's why you're giving
him the silent treatment?

01:07:56.773 --> 01:07:57.574
Tonight?

01:07:57.607 --> 01:07:59.008
It's a big night for him, honey.

01:07:59.042 --> 01:08:00.844
He needs your support
on a night like this.

01:08:03.947 --> 01:08:06.916
I know.

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:09.353
[humming]

01:08:15.459 --> 01:08:16.926
(SINGING) Over again.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:29.206
I live my life, oh--
[humming] All right.

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:31.341
I'm not even gonna get
into the Marty Sedgwick blow

01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:32.908
off extravaganza.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:35.879
Put a lot of energy into
making that meeting happen.

01:08:35.912 --> 01:08:37.247
Pulled a lot of strings.

01:08:37.281 --> 01:08:38.148
The thanks I get.

01:08:38.182 --> 01:08:39.649
Oh, well.

01:08:39.683 --> 01:08:41.084
Thought we weren't
gonna get into it?

01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:50.059
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and
gentlemen, the Suffolk Theatre

01:08:50.093 --> 01:08:52.529
and Electric Factory are
pleased to welcome, from deep

01:08:52.562 --> 01:08:54.997
in a [inaudible], the
pride of Ho-Ho-Kus,

01:08:55.031 --> 01:08:57.966
New Jersey, the king of
romance, please put your hands

01:08:58.001 --> 01:08:59.368
together for Mr. Paul Lombard!

01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:12.316
(SINGING) If I had been born
in Hindustan, I'd reincarnate

01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:13.983
like the Hindus can.

01:09:14.017 --> 01:09:14.951
Yeah, Pauly!

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:18.255
I'll tell you,
sir, I've got a plan

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:21.157
when I live my life over again.

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:30.800
There she is.

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:31.935
What's the verdict?

01:09:31.968 --> 01:09:36.240
Has the old guy still
got the juice, or what?

01:09:36.273 --> 01:09:37.807
You were great.

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:39.209
Where's Lucille?

01:09:39.243 --> 01:09:40.477
I don't know.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:41.745
Where's the record people?
I thought they were here?

01:09:41.778 --> 01:09:42.679
They said so.

01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:44.314
They should see this.

01:09:44.348 --> 01:09:45.649
They'll hear
about it, I'm sure.

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.116
I can't take a chance.

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:48.252
I gotta play out more.

01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:50.086
I'm gonna get Alan to
book me some more shows.

01:09:50.118 --> 01:09:52.522
Maybe LA, you know--
you could make it there,

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:55.492
you can make it anywhere.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:59.263
You, um-- you sure
that's a good idea?

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:00.830
Yes.

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:02.198
I'm back.

01:10:02.232 --> 01:10:04.401
I'm due-- bi doo, bi doo.

01:10:04.434 --> 01:10:05.201
OK.

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:06.102
All right.

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:09.773
Just-- maybe take it slow.

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:12.676
I've been doing
that for 25 years.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:13.943
You gotta strike.

01:10:13.977 --> 01:10:15.979
Did you talk to that
Flaming Lips guy?

01:10:16.012 --> 01:10:17.180
Wayne Coil?

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:20.450
It's Wayne Coyne, and
no, I did not talk to him.

01:10:20.484 --> 01:10:21.785
Why?

01:10:21.818 --> 01:10:24.354
Jude, when a window
opens, you gotta jump.

01:10:24.388 --> 01:10:25.722
You never want to do that.

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:28.157
Jesus, Paul, do you really
want to talk about this now?

01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:28.958
Tonight?

01:10:28.992 --> 01:10:29.893
Again?

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:31.094
You're scared.

01:10:31.127 --> 01:10:34.130
I don't know about what,
but you are, and it shows.

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:35.832
You'd be better
and more successful

01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:38.302
if you'd cut the beebop and
just get out of your own way.

01:10:38.335 --> 01:10:39.102
Stop.

01:10:39.135 --> 01:10:40.169
Just get over it.

01:10:40.203 --> 01:10:41.237
God, Paul, stop.

01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:42.406
Just get over it.

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:45.041
Say yes, cause
scared is good for--

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.944
Paul, are you fucking stupid?

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:52.282
The audience only liked you
today because you were kitsch.

01:10:52.316 --> 01:10:53.249
Don't you get that?

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:54.984
You're a fucking dancing monkey.

01:10:55.018 --> 01:10:55.719
A joke.

01:10:58.355 --> 01:11:01.558
That's why they liked you.

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:02.292
I know that.

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:07.364
You think I don't know that?

01:11:07.397 --> 01:11:08.097
So what?

01:11:11.167 --> 01:11:12.636
[phone ringing]

01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:14.070
RECORDING: You've
reached Lucille Lombard.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:15.472
I can't come to the
phone right now,

01:11:15.505 --> 01:11:16.840
but if you leave
a brief message,

01:11:16.873 --> 01:11:18.107
I'll get right back to you.

01:11:18.141 --> 01:11:19.976
PAUL: Lucille, you OK?

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:23.046
The show was more
than I imagined.

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:25.882
Really, I-- I'm sorry
you weren't there, babe.

01:11:25.915 --> 01:11:26.850
That surprised me.

01:11:26.883 --> 01:11:28.284
They told me you weren't there.

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:44.734
Lucille, you OK?

01:11:44.768 --> 01:11:45.635
Whoa!

01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:46.936
What?

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.004
You shit!

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:44.828
Now, focus here.

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:47.063
He's showing 16.

01:12:47.096 --> 01:12:51.100
Common wisdom is you stick
at 16, you play it safe.

01:12:51.134 --> 01:12:53.403
What do we say about
playing it safe?

01:12:53.437 --> 01:12:55.038
That's for pussies?

01:12:55.071 --> 01:12:56.440
Exactamundo.

01:12:56.473 --> 01:12:59.776
So how's Dad holding
up since Lucille left?

01:12:59.809 --> 01:13:03.079
You know, ain't
exactly new form.

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:04.213
Yeah.

01:13:04.247 --> 01:13:06.583
I have a feeling this
one's going to get ugly.

01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:07.383
It's like something--

01:13:07.417 --> 01:13:09.218
Out of Mamet?

01:13:09.252 --> 01:13:12.656
It's exactly like
something out of Mamet.

01:13:12.689 --> 01:13:13.690
Where was I?

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:15.892
You were in London,
with Harry Nelson.

01:13:15.925 --> 01:13:17.927
Nilsson.

01:13:17.961 --> 01:13:22.031
OK, so I'm in London,
it's the '80s,

01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:25.234
I'm in this club-- it's 5:00 AM.

01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:28.104
I'm with Cosmo, the
manager of The Clash.

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:33.577
I was never a big punk person,
but Cosmo was the real deal.

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:34.778
Big heart.

01:13:34.811 --> 01:13:38.381
And he had on this
fantastic shirt,

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:42.185
and I said to him, Cosmo,
that shirt is fantastic.

01:13:42.218 --> 01:13:43.019
And he said, you want it?

01:13:43.052 --> 01:13:44.353
Let's swap.

01:13:44.387 --> 01:13:48.057
So right there, he peels it
off, and he hands it to me.

01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:50.293
Now here, you
should double down.

01:13:50.326 --> 01:13:53.129
I taught you how to double down.

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:54.764
I got the best of that swap.

01:13:54.798 --> 01:13:57.567
It still fits.

01:13:57.601 --> 01:13:58.301
Now you do it.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:07.010
As anticipated, Lucille
filed the divorce papers

01:14:07.043 --> 01:14:07.911
this morning.

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:10.980
But there's a little wrinkle.

01:14:11.014 --> 01:14:12.649
Lucille is claiming
that she wrote "When

01:14:12.682 --> 01:14:14.050
I Live My Life Over Again."

01:14:14.083 --> 01:14:15.519
Oh, that's absurd.

01:14:15.552 --> 01:14:17.353
No court's gonna buy that.

01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:19.322
It's not quite as open and
shut a case as you might think.

01:14:19.355 --> 01:14:21.791
It's not like Paul is known
for his songwriting abilities.

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:25.228
Where does it say that
the two skills are related?

01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:28.598
Did anybody complain that Brando
didn't write his own lines?

01:14:28.632 --> 01:14:29.933
I know that, but,
you know, she's

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:32.902
exploiting a-- a vulnerability
in the public perception.

01:14:32.936 --> 01:14:35.271
Well, has Lucille
ever written a song?

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:38.241
No, but she does happen
to be in possession

01:14:38.274 --> 01:14:40.343
of a very compelling piece
of physical evidence,

01:14:40.376 --> 01:14:44.080
which is the original
manuscript of the song,

01:14:44.113 --> 01:14:45.481
in her own handwriting.

01:14:45.515 --> 01:14:49.953
Yes, I was driving-- I dictated
it to her while I was driving

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:51.454
with both hands on the wheel.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.789
Were there any
witnesses to that?

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:53.590
Lucille.

01:14:53.623 --> 01:14:55.725
Well, you see the problem.

01:14:55.759 --> 01:14:57.126
I mean, can't you
threaten to, like,

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.662
counter-sue her, or something?

01:14:58.695 --> 01:15:00.897
Of course I can, and I will.

01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:04.968
But she's girding for a
long, drawn out legal battle.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:07.436
She's going to drag your
reputation through the mud,

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:10.039
call your integrity
into question, and PS,

01:15:10.073 --> 01:15:11.941
it's going to be
extremely expensive.

01:15:11.975 --> 01:15:15.945
She could be counting on the
fact that you're gonna settle.

01:15:15.979 --> 01:15:17.581
Settle how?

01:15:17.614 --> 01:15:20.950
By offering to share
songwriting credit with her.

01:15:20.984 --> 01:15:23.720
I'd rather stick
pins in my eyeballs.

01:15:23.753 --> 01:15:25.922
Well, there is another option.

01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:27.290
Don't release the song.

01:15:27.323 --> 01:15:28.692
I mean, give her all
the credit she wants,

01:15:28.725 --> 01:15:31.227
but, you know, she'll never
make a penny off of it,

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.762
because no one
will ever hear it.

01:15:32.796 --> 01:15:34.063
Simple.

01:15:34.097 --> 01:15:37.901
It's actually not the
stupidest idea I ever heard.

01:15:37.934 --> 01:15:39.335
It's close.

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:40.837
You know, you
just have to decide

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.906
how badly you want to
beat her, and if you want

01:15:42.939 --> 01:15:45.408
to sacrifice your comeback.

01:15:45.441 --> 01:15:46.843
I have another idea.

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:47.577
What?

01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:01.457
[knocking]

01:16:03.326 --> 01:16:04.393
You it busy?

01:16:04.427 --> 01:16:05.929
Oh, um--

01:16:05.962 --> 01:16:06.963
Good.

01:16:06.996 --> 01:16:07.897
About the other night--

01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:09.332
Look, Tim, seriously, I--

01:16:09.365 --> 01:16:11.534
Jude, we have to
talk about this.

01:16:14.137 --> 01:16:17.306
You weren't entirely
to blame for all that.

01:16:20.143 --> 01:16:22.411
And I know, you know,
one of the reasons

01:16:22.445 --> 01:16:26.149
you don't come out here
so often is because of me.

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:28.918
Don't flatter yourself.

01:16:28.952 --> 01:16:29.653
Am I wrong?

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:35.091
You know what?

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:41.364
Hang on.

01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:44.500
I can't deny, you know,
it's fun playing what ifs,

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:47.136
and, you know,
flirting with you.

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:51.207
Fantasizing.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.342
I-- I know I do it.

01:16:53.376 --> 01:16:54.110
I know it's wrong.

01:16:59.849 --> 01:17:01.117
Sorry.

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:05.822
I'm-- not used to being told
something's not my fault.

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:09.058
Uh, you know, I said it
was not entirely your fault,

01:17:09.092 --> 01:17:10.794
so it's really
just not entirely--

01:17:10.827 --> 01:17:11.594
You know what?

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:12.628
It's close enough.

01:17:12.662 --> 01:17:13.362
I'll take it.

01:17:21.805 --> 01:17:22.571
No.

01:17:22.605 --> 01:17:23.940
God, Tim.

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:25.141
I'm sorry.

01:17:25.174 --> 01:17:26.075
I thought-- I thought
that was what you wanted.

01:17:26.109 --> 01:17:27.076
No.
God.

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:30.613
I mean-- but-- yes.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:35.184
Yeah, but you said it yourself.

01:17:35.218 --> 01:17:36.185
It's not right.

01:17:36.219 --> 01:17:37.253
All right.

01:17:37.286 --> 01:17:40.890
And you're just figuring
this out now, huh?

01:17:40.924 --> 01:17:42.625
Yeah.

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:45.161
Kinda.

01:17:45.194 --> 01:17:46.129
I know it's fucked up, Tim.

01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:55.604
What do you want, Jude?

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:18.527
A sparkling blanc
with citrus and ginger?

01:18:18.561 --> 01:18:19.262
Right here.

01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:24.433
And a decaf flat white.

01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:30.639
So, what is it
that's on your mind?

01:18:30.673 --> 01:18:32.942
Obviously everyone's very
upset about what's going on,

01:18:32.976 --> 01:18:35.178
and one of the most
disturbing things

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:38.014
is your claim that you
wrote "When I Live My Life."

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:39.082
It's not a claim.

01:18:39.115 --> 01:18:40.483
It's a fact.

01:18:40.516 --> 01:18:42.418
Tell me how that happened.

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:44.754
How you wrote the song.

01:18:44.788 --> 01:18:48.057
Well, your father and I
were driving down the road.

01:18:48.091 --> 01:18:50.059
And what road was that?

01:18:50.093 --> 01:18:51.828
95.

01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:55.464
And out of the blue, these
words just suddenly came to me.

01:18:55.498 --> 01:18:58.234
So the lyrics came
first, and then the music?

01:18:58.267 --> 01:19:00.503
Yes, the lyrics came first.

01:19:00.536 --> 01:19:03.773
So at dinner, when my father
said that he wrote the song

01:19:03.807 --> 01:19:07.210
and you just took dictation,
why did you back him up?

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:08.812
Look, I was not
going to embarrass

01:19:08.845 --> 01:19:10.579
him in front of his family.

01:19:10.613 --> 01:19:13.950
You know how fragile the
male ego is, especially his.

01:19:13.983 --> 01:19:15.819
You know, Lucille, if you
would have acted this well

01:19:15.852 --> 01:19:17.086
when you were doing
it for a living,

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.687
you might have had a career.

01:19:18.721 --> 01:19:19.989
Setting aside the
fact that we all

01:19:20.023 --> 01:19:21.891
know you couldn't
write a shopping list,

01:19:21.925 --> 01:19:25.929
let alone a hit song, this
Pinocchio tale of yours

01:19:25.962 --> 01:19:28.832
is the biggest load of shit
I've ever heard in my life.

01:19:28.865 --> 01:19:30.834
And a jury is going
to feel the same way.

01:19:30.867 --> 01:19:32.902
Yeah, well, we'll
see about that.

01:19:32.936 --> 01:19:36.572
What I am proposing is
an alternative to court.

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:39.809
We're prepared to offer you a
very fair lump sum in exchange

01:19:39.843 --> 01:19:41.210
for making this all go away.

01:19:41.244 --> 01:19:43.913
And what's your definition
of this very fair lump sum?

01:19:51.687 --> 01:19:52.588
Are you kidding with that?

01:19:56.225 --> 01:19:57.961
That is a joke.

01:19:57.994 --> 01:19:59.628
That is what we're offering.

01:19:59.662 --> 01:20:01.797
And what if I refuse?

01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:03.499
Then we'll all put
on our Sunday best,

01:20:03.532 --> 01:20:05.134
and we'll go to court.

01:20:05.168 --> 01:20:07.070
Guess I'll see you there, then.

01:20:07.103 --> 01:20:09.873
I think I'm gonna
have the crepe.

01:20:09.906 --> 01:20:11.941
By the way, have
you seen this movie

01:20:11.975 --> 01:20:16.145
called "Beverly Hills Cock?"

01:20:16.179 --> 01:20:19.615
How about "Desperately
Sucking Susan?"

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:22.251
I haven't seen them myself,
not being an aficionado

01:20:22.285 --> 01:20:25.188
of '80s porn, but the private
eye who found them for me

01:20:25.221 --> 01:20:26.689
says you gave quite
the performance.

01:20:30.693 --> 01:20:32.461
You didn't think we knew
about that part of your past,

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:33.963
did you?

01:20:33.997 --> 01:20:37.133
And these aren't softcore
nudies we're talking about,

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:40.069
particularly this film
called "Poonstruck."

01:20:40.103 --> 01:20:41.504
No, I was never in that.

01:20:41.537 --> 01:20:42.738
That is a fucking lie.

01:20:42.771 --> 01:20:44.707
But we'll say you were.

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:46.442
We'll say lots of
things, and we'll

01:20:46.475 --> 01:20:48.244
leave it up to the
court of public opinion

01:20:48.277 --> 01:20:52.015
to sort it all out.

01:20:52.048 --> 01:20:53.216
Jesus Christ.

01:20:53.249 --> 01:20:55.885
What do you think this
is, "The Scarlet Letter?"

01:20:55.919 --> 01:20:59.522
OK, so I did some skin flicks
when I was a young actress.

01:20:59.555 --> 01:21:01.424
Big fucking deal.

01:21:01.457 --> 01:21:04.627
Your father hasn't been
a choir boy all his life.

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:07.163
I'm sure there's
some dirty laundry

01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:08.497
that he wouldn't like aired.

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:10.799
Yeah, it's a funny thing
about that, actually.

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:15.438
Paul's history sort of
insulates him on that front.

01:21:15.471 --> 01:21:20.876
It's that, uh, ugly
double standard again.

01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:23.779
So what I'm here to ask you
is are you willing to pass up

01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:27.216
a guaranteed payday to spend
years in a long legal battle

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:31.520
over the share of rights to a
song that may or may not even

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:34.557
see the light of day, and
have your name dragged

01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:36.559
through the mud,
which I assure you Al

01:21:36.592 --> 01:21:39.595
and I will absolutely
make sure happens?

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:41.497
Or do you want to
take what I'm offering

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:43.466
and move on with your life?

01:21:43.499 --> 01:21:45.501
Don't be stupid, Lucille.

01:21:45.534 --> 01:21:46.269
Take the money.

01:21:50.039 --> 01:21:52.841
Wow, Jude was right.

01:21:52.875 --> 01:21:57.947
You really are a cold-hearted
little cunt, aren't you?

01:21:57.981 --> 01:21:59.548
Do we have a deal, or not?

01:22:05.721 --> 01:22:06.522
He hurt me.

01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:13.429
He hurt me really bad.

01:22:13.462 --> 01:22:16.365
I know.

01:22:16.399 --> 01:22:17.566
He does that to everyone.

01:22:23.806 --> 01:22:25.374

leaving my wife.

01:22:25.408 --> 01:22:27.010
No bullshit this time.

01:22:27.043 --> 01:22:29.712
No.

01:22:29.745 --> 01:22:31.680
I don't want you to.

01:22:31.714 --> 01:22:32.781
I'm done.

not thinking straight.

Things will look different
to you in a day or two.

They always do.

01:22:38.354 --> 01:22:40.189

I'm saying I want you to stay.

Please.

01:22:49.198 --> 01:22:51.700
Sorry.

01:22:51.734 --> 01:22:54.303
Leaving's the right thing to do.

01:23:04.847 --> 01:23:05.548
How about this?

01:23:08.217 --> 01:23:10.753
How about I've made enough
stupid decisions for awhile,

01:23:10.786 --> 01:23:14.790
and I'm gonna try and see how
smart ones work out for me?

therapist I'd say good for you,

01:23:17.093 --> 01:23:22.065

last thing I want to hear.

01:23:22.098 --> 01:23:23.266

Hello?

01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:41.444
Corinne Lombard Sanderson,
this is Jude Lipman.

01:24:41.477 --> 01:24:43.112
What do you need, Jude?

01:24:43.146 --> 01:24:44.980
Why do I have to
need something?

01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:48.717
I often ask myself that.

01:24:48.751 --> 01:24:49.985
Wait, where are you?

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:51.954
I'm in your house.

01:24:51.987 --> 01:24:52.688
Har har.

01:24:57.993 --> 01:25:07.102
I wanted to, um, tell you,
you, um-- you did a good job.

01:25:09.472 --> 01:25:10.173
With Lucifer.

01:25:14.243 --> 01:25:14.943
Thank you.

01:25:18.214 --> 01:25:19.915
I heard Tim took you
to an open mic night.

01:25:23.319 --> 01:25:24.019
Uh, yeah.

01:25:27.089 --> 01:25:29.992
It was nice.

01:25:30.025 --> 01:25:33.762
Yeah, Tim's a-- a nice guy.

01:25:33.796 --> 01:25:42.037
I, um-- I also wanted to,
um, tell you something else.

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:46.975
I am, uh-- I'm leaving.

01:25:48.010 --> 01:25:48.711
Oh.

01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:53.249
Where to?

01:25:53.282 --> 01:25:54.950
California.

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:55.751
Uh, hey.

01:25:55.784 --> 01:25:57.753
What's going on?

01:25:57.786 --> 01:26:00.723
Uh, Jude's moving
to California.

01:26:00.756 --> 01:26:02.658
Mm.

01:26:02.691 --> 01:26:05.461
Yeah, I figured it was,
uh, about time for me

01:26:05.494 --> 01:26:08.231
to leave my parents' basement.

01:26:08.264 --> 01:26:11.300
Metaphorically speaking.

01:26:11.334 --> 01:26:16.839
So, no offense, but is
this you leaving the nest,

01:26:16.872 --> 01:26:20.243
or just running away
from your problems?

01:26:20.276 --> 01:26:22.177
Metaphorically speaking.

01:26:22.211 --> 01:26:24.513
I don't know.

01:26:24.547 --> 01:26:26.982
Compliment received, by the way.

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:29.718
I did say no offense.

01:26:29.752 --> 01:26:31.320
So when are you going?

01:26:31.354 --> 01:26:34.323
Uh, this afternoon.

01:26:34.357 --> 01:26:38.827
I just wanted to
come by and say bye.

01:26:38.861 --> 01:26:40.529
Well, um--

01:26:40.563 --> 01:26:43.632
I'm taking this.

01:26:43.666 --> 01:26:45.634
Hey, Jude?

01:26:45.668 --> 01:26:46.369
Yeah?

01:26:49.872 --> 01:26:51.240
Take care of yourself, OK?

01:26:54.743 --> 01:26:57.280
You too, Corinne.

01:26:57.313 --> 01:26:58.013
Later, Tim.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:11.760
Hey.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:16.765

01:27:19.635 --> 01:27:21.770
You set to go?

Where to?

01:27:22.605 --> 01:27:23.839
LA?

01:27:23.872 --> 01:27:25.274
Frisco?

01:27:25.308 --> 01:27:26.241
Don't call it Frisco.

01:27:26.275 --> 01:27:28.644
They hate that.

01:27:28.677 --> 01:27:29.845
I don't know.

01:27:29.878 --> 01:27:31.914
I guess I'll decide
when I get to Arizona.

01:27:38.654 --> 01:27:39.622
I wish I was better.

you, no matter what.

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:54.437
I know that you know that.

01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:56.405
Yeah.

01:27:56.439 --> 01:27:57.806
Strangely enough, I do.

01:28:02.311 --> 01:28:09.117
Well, wear your
seatbelt. Call me.

01:28:09.151 --> 01:28:11.387

anymore, Paul.
