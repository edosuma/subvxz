02:03.800 --> 02:05.768
<i>Dear Mom...</i>

02:05.836 --> 02:08.100
<i>I know you've tried
to protect me from who I am...</i>

02:08.172 --> 02:10.732
<i>and you've said my life
before you adopted me doesn't matter...</i>

02:10.806 --> 02:12.741
<i>but it does matter.</i>

02:12.809 --> 02:17.075
<i>It matters because I still have visions
of the place where I was born.</i>

02:17.147 --> 02:21.811
<i>I've heard all the whispers. I know what
happened in that town where I was born.</i>

02:21.885 --> 02:26.151
<i>And I know you've tried to protect me
from its horror for 19 years.</i>

02:26.223 --> 02:29.818
<i>Well, today I'm going back to that
little abandoned town called Gatlin...</i>

02:29.893 --> 02:31.827
<i>home to the truth.</i>

02:31.895 --> 02:34.090
<i>Love, Hannah.</i>

02:47.812 --> 02:50.178
<i>Hey, I need your help.
Please stop.</i>

02:57.922 --> 03:02.723
<i>- Is there anything I can do?
- Thanks for stoppin'.</i>

03:02.794 --> 03:06.525
<i>Just need a ride to Gatlin.
I'd really be much obliged.</i>

03:06.598 --> 03:09.795
- Oh, you're from Gatlin, huh?
- Yeah.

03:11.569 --> 03:15.801
- Um, about how far up the road is it?
- About ten miles.

03:18.843 --> 03:20.777
I guess I could
give you a ride.

03:20.845 --> 03:26.579
<i>- I'm going there anyway.
- Bless you, sister. Just a minute.</i>

03:54.580 --> 03:56.980
My name's
Zechariah Johnson.

03:58.550 --> 04:03.351
<i>- Miss?
- Oh, I'm Hannah, Hannah Martin.</i>

04:05.190 --> 04:09.024
And Hannah said,
"I am a woman of sorrowful spirit.

04:09.094 --> 04:13.690
If thou will give me a son, I will give him
unto the Lord all the days of his life. "

04:13.766 --> 04:18.430
First Book of Samuel. Surely you're
familiar with the origins of your name.

04:18.504 --> 04:20.938
I must've missed
that day of Sunday school.

04:21.005 --> 04:22.974
Let's just see here.

04:25.144 --> 04:29.137
"Hannah was barren.
She prayed to the Lord for His favor...

04:29.214 --> 04:31.273
and the Lord remembered her.

04:31.350 --> 04:35.650
Hannah bore a son.
She named him Samuel. "

04:35.721 --> 04:38.588
That's nice.

04:38.657 --> 04:40.716
"Because he had
the gift of visions...

04:40.793 --> 04:44.024
<i>Samuel became
a great prophet. "</i>

04:46.799 --> 04:49.791
If you have a son,
you should name him Samuel.

04:49.868 --> 04:52.064
Oh, I don't see kids
in my future.

04:53.573 --> 04:55.803
Unfortunately,
that's not for you to decide.

04:55.875 --> 05:01.245
- Uh, fortunately, I have a choice.
- Do you?

05:30.910 --> 05:34.209
What?

05:34.280 --> 05:36.680
<i>- Lookin'for somethin'?
- Oh, I, uh...</i>

05:36.750 --> 05:42.188
Is this how they come
to a complete stop in California?

05:42.255 --> 05:44.314
I, uh... A cat ran out
into the middle of the road.

05:44.391 --> 05:47.588
- A cat? Cheshire?
- Whatever it was, I didn't want to hit it.

05:47.660 --> 05:50.424
<i>Well, that's the chance you take
straying so far from the interstate.</i>

05:52.031 --> 05:54.728
License, please.

05:54.802 --> 05:57.156
You know, I think I might
need to see a doctor.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.483
No doctors around here.

05:58.518 --> 06:02.639
W- What about
Gatlin County Hospital?

06:04.478 --> 06:06.969
Can't you do better
than that?

06:07.047 --> 06:09.379
You're just like
the rest of them.

06:09.450 --> 06:12.317
<i>You want to gawk
at the freak show.</i>

06:12.386 --> 06:15.253
License. Now.

06:38.245 --> 06:42.705
<i>The angel of death came down,
and he wiped out the firstborn son...</i>

06:42.783 --> 06:47.083
<i>from Pharaoh's firstborn son
on down to the lowliest prisoner in...</i>

06:47.154 --> 06:51.488
<i>- It's her.
- God, wipe them all out! And finally...</i>

07:01.736 --> 07:04.227
Hey, you're right.

07:04.306 --> 07:06.672
We better have Dr. Michaels
take a look at you.

07:08.710 --> 07:10.837
<i>Someone will pick up
your car later.</i>

07:27.429 --> 07:30.489
Sorry. Regulations.

07:57.259 --> 07:59.193
It's that way.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.751
Frankly, I don't
see the fascination.

08:29.825 --> 08:33.090
Gatlin is just a ghost town
with an ugly past.

08:34.897 --> 08:36.922
That's what put it
on the Internet.

08:36.999 --> 08:40.230
Did everybody leave?

08:41.537 --> 08:44.768
Some stayed.
I did.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.774
Why?

08:46.842 --> 08:49.902
I was born here...

08:49.979 --> 08:52.709
and I guess
I'll die here.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.550
It's a small town.
You probably know everybody, huh?

09:02.892 --> 09:05.760
So, what happened
to all the kids?

09:05.829 --> 09:09.094
<i>Did any of the children
have children?</i>

09:33.790 --> 09:37.317
- Probably started
their own support group?

09:37.394 --> 09:39.328
"I survived
the Gatlin massacre. "

09:49.039 --> 09:51.200
So, am I gonna live
till my next birthday?

09:51.274 --> 09:55.335
It's tomorrow,
isn't it? Halloween.

10:00.550 --> 10:03.417
Miss Martin...

10:03.487 --> 10:06.285
there's nothing wrong
with your head.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.053
Just a bump.

10:10.728 --> 10:15.324
- No charge.
- Thanks.

10:21.372 --> 10:23.306
How do I get
to the town square?

10:25.610 --> 10:28.545
You know, whatever you're looking for
here, Miss Martin, you're not gonna find it.

10:28.613 --> 10:31.480
Do yourself a favor
and go back to California.

10:31.549 --> 10:34.313
You're only
gonna be disappointed.

10:34.385 --> 10:39.254
You finished? I got some trouble
out here. I can't find him.

10:39.323 --> 10:42.315
Well, don't worry about it.
It's not the first time.

10:44.996 --> 10:47.965
<i>Jake? Jake!</i>

11:00.411 --> 11:02.345
Ooh.

12:04.209 --> 12:07.474
Stop him.
Only you can stop him.

12:09.114 --> 12:12.242
Stop him! Stop him!

12:14.219 --> 12:18.281
Somebody, help me!

12:28.935 --> 12:31.802
<i>It's your life. Stop him!
Only you can stop Isaac!</i>

12:31.871 --> 12:34.431
- Get off!
- He's the resurrection and the life.

12:34.507 --> 12:36.771
He's the resurrection
and the life.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.970
- Get off! Get away!
- He's the resurrection and the life.

12:39.045 --> 12:41.104
Help, someone!

12:41.181 --> 12:44.617
Help me!
Anyone there?

12:58.364 --> 13:00.730
He's the resurrection and the life.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.734
He's the resurrection
and the life.

13:02.802 --> 13:04.929
Whoever shall believe in him
shall have eternal life.

13:05.004 --> 13:06.938
He's the resurrection
and the life.

13:07.006 --> 13:10.874
Whoever shall believe in him
shall have eternal life!

13:12.412 --> 13:14.812
He's the resurrection
and the life.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.111
- Help me, somebody!
- He's the resurrection and the life.

13:17.183 --> 13:19.118
- Help!
- He's the resurrection and the life.

13:19.186 --> 13:22.747
Whoever shall believe in him
shall have eternal life!

13:24.091 --> 13:29.723
Only you can stop Isaac.
Only you can stop Isaac.

13:29.797 --> 13:32.732
Only you can stop Isaac.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.234
Only you can stop Isaac.

14:42.037 --> 14:44.005
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:44.072 --> 14:46.006
<i>I guess I took a wrong turn.</i>

14:46.074 --> 14:49.475
<i>- You shouldn't be here.
- So, what's wrong with him?</i>

14:49.544 --> 14:53.105
<i>- Coma.
- But his eyes are open.</i>

14:53.181 --> 14:55.479
<i>Settle down, Jake.
Let's go take a look.</i>

14:55.550 --> 14:57.814
Shit, it's my ass
if Cora finds you here.

14:59.421 --> 15:02.151
How did this get open?
Hmm?

15:02.223 --> 15:04.487
Come on.
Let's go.

15:07.295 --> 15:10.355
Come on, Jake.
Head up.

15:13.568 --> 15:16.196
Mouth closed.

15:21.042 --> 15:25.503
<i>Come on. Let's get
the hell outta here.</i>

15:30.119 --> 15:33.782
<i>What, do you, like, get off hanging
out in hospitals or somethin'?</i>

15:33.856 --> 15:35.847
<i>I think I'd say
the same thing to you.</i>

15:35.925 --> 15:39.656
- I work here. My name's Gabriel.
- How'd that get here?

15:39.729 --> 15:42.698
<i>Cora asked me
to pick it up for you.</i>

15:46.402 --> 15:51.499
<i>- What were you doin'out there anyway?
- Drivin' too fast.</i>

15:53.943 --> 15:56.002
I'll see ya around.

15:58.981 --> 16:01.108
Stay out of trouble.

16:08.190 --> 16:11.091
<i>- Why'd you let her go?
- She'll be back.</i>

16:11.160 --> 16:12.801
Why didn't you just tell her?

16:12.802 --> 16:15.787
The prophecy says she
has to find out for herself.

16:16.022 --> 16:18.563
Shouldn't you be doing
some tests or something?

16:19.264 --> 16:20.217
Yeah.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.761
You ought to know better, Doc.
Those things will kill ya.

16:22.838 --> 16:25.500
Why do you think I do it?

18:03.207 --> 18:05.175
<i>The blood of the lamb shall
smite the wicked.</i>

18:05.243 --> 18:07.507
<i>The blood of the lamb shall
smite the wicked.</i>

18:07.578 --> 18:11.480
The blood of the lamb
shall smite the wicked.

18:11.549 --> 18:16.043
The blood of the lamb
shall smite the wicked.

18:16.120 --> 18:20.989
The blood of the lamb
shall smite the wicked.

18:22.558 --> 18:24.459
<i>No, Jake. No!</i>

18:24.529 --> 18:27.589
Jake! No! Jake!

18:27.665 --> 18:30.964
We can't.
It'll make us just like them.

18:31.035 --> 18:32.969
<i>No, I don't understand.</i>

18:33.037 --> 18:34.972
<i>Why do you have to be
a part of this?</i>

18:35.040 --> 18:37.099
I don't have a choice.
She's callin' the shots.

18:37.176 --> 18:39.303
Cora? Tell her how
you feel about this.

18:39.378 --> 18:41.312
- Say something.
- Like what?

18:41.380 --> 18:45.407
<i>- Choose someone else.
You love me anyway.</i>

18:48.487 --> 18:50.421
- Can I help you with something?
- Actually, yeah.

18:50.489 --> 18:52.548
Um, can I use your phone?
I need to call the police.

18:52.624 --> 18:55.991
- You want to talk to Cora?
- There's no other cops?

18:56.061 --> 18:58.086
There's no
other nothing.

18:58.163 --> 19:01.098
And anyway,
the phones are out.

19:05.137 --> 19:07.128
Extra towels are under the sink.

19:07.206 --> 19:11.233
<i>No fancy shampoo bottles, so I
hope you brought your own, and...</i>

19:11.310 --> 19:13.744
you can
check out whenever.

19:13.812 --> 19:17.441
- Is there another hotel around?
- Hilton, in Omaha.

19:17.516 --> 19:20.417
<i>Anything else?</i>

19:20.485 --> 19:24.182
Matt, you deal with this.

19:26.258 --> 19:28.920
I think that means
she wants you to follow her.

19:30.762 --> 19:34.630
Don't you want
the room, Hannah?

19:34.700 --> 19:37.100
Small town.

19:41.507 --> 19:43.634
What'd you need
the sheriff for?

19:46.412 --> 19:48.346
Nothing.

19:54.887 --> 19:58.050
<i>Maybe she doesn't want
to be a part of this either.</i>

20:11.271 --> 20:14.729
<i>I told you, nothing's changed.
- It will.</i>

20:16.209 --> 20:18.143
It has to.

20:18.211 --> 20:21.009
<i>She's here.
I knew she was alive.</i>

20:21.080 --> 20:23.947
<i>Your hopes
are the rantings of a delusional child.</i>

20:24.017 --> 20:28.113
That's not true.

20:28.187 --> 20:30.519
Cora, you listen to me.

20:30.590 --> 20:35.721
Jake needs you. Don't destroy his life
by starting this again.

20:35.795 --> 20:38.423
Assuming that
it's ever stopped.

21:18.339 --> 21:20.500
<i>I'm gettin'it.
I'm gettin'it.</i>

21:39.159 --> 21:41.559
Look, man. It's her.

22:27.275 --> 22:29.209
How long?

22:31.980 --> 22:35.609
Nineteen years.

22:35.683 --> 22:38.481
Nineteen years?

22:38.553 --> 22:41.386
But you've
come back to us.

22:42.891 --> 22:45.587
I never lost faith.

22:48.297 --> 22:50.322
And the others?

22:52.101 --> 22:56.868
Isaac, you have a son.

22:56.939 --> 23:00.102
He's perfect.

23:00.176 --> 23:03.270
I've prepared him.

23:03.345 --> 23:05.813
He knows?

23:05.881 --> 23:08.145
Everything.

23:33.943 --> 23:36.503
Isaac has risen.

23:40.950 --> 23:43.316
Isaac has risen.

23:45.955 --> 23:48.150
Isaac has risen.

24:28.064 --> 24:29.998
<i>Destiny.</i>

24:34.538 --> 24:36.802
<i>Promise me.</i>

24:40.176 --> 24:42.235
<i>Destiny.</i>

24:42.312 --> 24:44.872
<i>Destiny.</i>

24:44.948 --> 24:46.882
<i>Hannah...</i>

24:46.950 --> 24:50.511
<i>don't move or
the visions will come true.</i>

24:50.587 --> 24:52.612
No! No! Help!

25:01.299 --> 25:03.426
You know, Hannah...

25:03.501 --> 25:05.867
if you're gonna keep
visiting Isaac...

25:05.937 --> 25:08.735
there's probably something
you should know.

25:08.806 --> 25:11.240
<i>It's a small town.
People are gonna talk.</i>

25:16.514 --> 25:19.847
So, if they never arrested him,
then why is he locked up?

25:19.917 --> 25:22.886
Cora did that.

25:22.954 --> 25:25.115
So nobody would see him?

25:25.189 --> 25:29.922
No, so they wouldn't
kill him.

25:29.994 --> 25:31.985
Well, he's not
in his room, you know.

25:33.831 --> 25:36.391
Look, did you come all this way
to talk about Isaac?

25:36.467 --> 25:39.095
No.

25:39.170 --> 25:42.162
I came to find my mother.

25:42.239 --> 25:47.472
Wanna help? You can show me
where they keep the birth certificates.

25:47.545 --> 25:51.709
They told me my mother was dead,
but I'm not so sure.

25:51.782 --> 25:54.649
- Oh, my God.
- In a better world, they'd be labeled.

25:54.719 --> 25:58.315
Yeah, well, in a better world,
a lot of things would be different.

26:01.026 --> 26:04.291
- 1978?
- Mm-hmm.

26:04.363 --> 26:06.422
Where do we start?

26:06.498 --> 26:09.467
<i>Grab anything
from October 31.</i>

26:09.534 --> 26:12.332
So, you find your mother.
Then what?

26:12.404 --> 26:15.066
<i>Jerry Springer show.</i>

26:15.140 --> 26:17.131
"Daughters of
cult members unite. "

26:17.209 --> 26:19.370
Don't let it
screw you up.

26:20.712 --> 26:22.646
What would you know
about it?

26:22.714 --> 26:25.615
My parents were cult members...

26:25.684 --> 26:28.983
just like Matt's,
Morgan's, Jesse's.

26:29.054 --> 26:31.852
<i>- Pretty much everyone around here.
- You mean that they're all...</i>

26:31.923 --> 26:34.653
Children of the children.

26:40.866 --> 26:43.664
Well, too bad I can't
go talk to Isaac then.

26:43.735 --> 26:46.431
<i>He probably knows
who my mother is.</i>

26:46.505 --> 26:48.700
And he's done so much
for Gatlin already.

26:50.575 --> 26:53.874
What, like tell kids
to waste their parents?

26:55.447 --> 27:00.248
At least you've done your research.

27:00.318 --> 27:03.345
<i>What the hell are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?</i>

27:03.423 --> 27:07.621
<i>What the hell! What... You don't go
sneakin'up on people like that, Jake!</i>

27:09.328 --> 27:11.990
Come on.
Come on.

27:12.065 --> 27:15.728
- Who is he?
- It's Jake. It's Cora's brother.

27:15.802 --> 27:18.600
That guy is dangerous!

27:18.671 --> 27:20.832
No. No.
You're not dangerous, are you?

27:20.907 --> 27:24.399
<i>I think I should really get him back.</i>

27:24.477 --> 27:28.980
- You gonna be okay here?
- I've been in worse places.

27:28.982 --> 27:31.093
Eleanor begat Jacob. Cora.
Mary begat Rachel.

27:31.094 --> 27:31.864
Come on, Jake.

27:32.018 --> 27:34.680
- Come on, Jake. Chin up! Chin up!
- Sarah begat Isaac.

27:34.754 --> 27:37.279
<i>Sarah begat Isaac.
Hannah begat Samuel.</i>

27:37.356 --> 27:40.257
<i>Hannah begat Samuel.
Hannah begat Samuel.</i>

27:40.326 --> 27:42.794
- Come on, Jake. Come on, Jake.
- Hannah begat Samuel.

27:42.862 --> 27:47.458
- Come on. Come on. Come on, Jake.
- Hannah begat Samuel.

27:47.533 --> 27:50.127
<i>Destiny.</i>

27:50.203 --> 27:53.969
<i>Destiny. Destiny.</i>

27:54.040 --> 27:57.168
<i>Destiny. Destiny.</i>

28:01.714 --> 28:06.414
<i>Rachel Colby.</i>

28:12.159 --> 28:15.060
<i>Hannah begat Samuel.</i>

28:15.129 --> 28:17.120
<i>You took her from her mother.</i>

28:57.004 --> 29:00.565
<i>So, now I get to chase you.</i>

30:24.493 --> 30:26.723
Morning.

30:26.795 --> 30:29.559
- Do you have a spare gas can?
- What?

30:29.632 --> 30:33.432
- A spare gas can. My bike's out of gas.
- Uh, no. Sorry.

30:36.372 --> 30:39.136
I should've known better.

30:39.208 --> 30:42.109
Don't ever loan anything
to Matt.

30:42.177 --> 30:44.304
I'll try
to remember that.

30:46.382 --> 30:49.408
Um, are you joining us
for the harvest?

30:49.485 --> 30:51.419
Gabriel will be there. I mean,
he's the one who told us about you.

30:51.487 --> 30:54.285
- I'm Jesse, by the way.
- Hi.

30:54.356 --> 30:57.325
It's fun. You can chip in,
if you want.

30:57.393 --> 31:00.885
- Good way to make friends.
- Thanks. I'll pass.

31:04.833 --> 31:06.824
Hey, Jesse!

31:08.203 --> 31:10.637
Yes, Hannah?

31:12.207 --> 31:14.904
Um, do you know
whose truck that is?

31:16.746 --> 31:19.840
Rachel Colby's.

31:44.040 --> 31:46.702
<i>- Rachel. What are you doing here?
- What do you want?</i>

31:46.776 --> 31:49.506
None of your business.

31:49.579 --> 31:54.141
- Well, I don't care. I don't care!
- He wants to see you.

31:56.252 --> 31:58.482
<i>Cora!</i>

32:04.094 --> 32:06.722
I'll go.

33:21.239 --> 33:24.402
- Boo.
- Look at this.

33:32.284 --> 33:34.980
I've waited 19 years
for tonight.

33:35.053 --> 33:39.319
It's over.
Your prophecy died with my child.

33:44.096 --> 33:45.366
My condolences.

33:45.567 --> 33:48.636
Bet you didn't count on
your kid rising from the dead.

33:48.671 --> 33:51.266
- She's not my daughter.
- Liar!

33:51.336 --> 33:55.670
If your baby died,
why are you still here?

33:55.740 --> 33:58.231
Someone had to stay
and take care of the children.

34:00.245 --> 34:02.645
What happened, Rachel?

34:04.015 --> 34:05.949
Why did you leave my side?

34:06.017 --> 34:09.248
You took my family,
my husband!

34:09.321 --> 34:14.485
Amos sacrificed himself for He Who Walks
Behind the Rows, our lord and savior.

34:14.559 --> 34:19.053
- Your words murdered him!
- Amos accepted his fate.

34:19.130 --> 34:22.589
Now it's time for you
to accept yours.

34:22.667 --> 34:25.431
His gift guaranteed purity
for your child.

34:25.505 --> 34:28.940
I rejoiced the day my child
was born dead.

34:29.007 --> 34:31.168
She was spared
a life of hell with you.

34:36.382 --> 34:39.612
Her betrayal was unforeseen...

34:39.685 --> 34:42.176
but it will be punished.

34:44.991 --> 34:47.652
Tonight...

34:47.726 --> 34:52.960
she will watch her daughter
foster a new generation of the chosen.

35:23.796 --> 35:26.629
I can't believe you let him
walk right outta here.

35:26.699 --> 35:30.363
<i>- He's not a prisoner.
- He should be.</i>

35:30.437 --> 35:34.897
Well, if it wasn't for a little
creative paperwork, you'd be in jail too.

35:37.277 --> 35:40.576
Why did we let it go so far?

35:40.647 --> 35:43.172
If I knew the answer
to that, I...

35:45.485 --> 35:48.886
That's your excuse.
What's mine?

35:58.832 --> 36:01.426
It's just
a harmless prank.

36:01.501 --> 36:04.868
- It's all clean.
- Good.

36:04.938 --> 36:08.396
- You know, if that's the way
my mother wants to play it...

36:08.475 --> 36:11.911
- Fine.
- Are you sure she's your mother?

36:11.979 --> 36:14.447
Oh, what is this all?
Just a coincidence?

36:14.514 --> 36:16.482
I mean, why the hell is she trying
to run me out of town?

36:16.550 --> 36:18.643
She's had to deal
with a pretty ugly past.

36:18.719 --> 36:20.710
So, what? I'm just supposed
to let her off the hook?

36:20.787 --> 36:24.746
<i>- I don't think so.
- Well, you saw the papers. Her baby died.</i>

36:24.825 --> 36:28.090
So, she could've faked
my death.

36:28.161 --> 36:32.826
<i>No offense, but Gatlin is starting to
look more and more like Mayberry on acid.</i>

36:32.900 --> 36:34.925
Just another farm town
falling off the map.

36:35.003 --> 36:38.404
<i>- People'll do anything to try and save it.
- Oh, shit!</i>

36:38.473 --> 36:41.874
God, what is it with
all these dead birds?

36:46.147 --> 36:48.615
Did you sleep at all?

36:56.457 --> 36:59.426
Between breaking and entering
and being stalked...

36:59.494 --> 37:01.894
I guess I forgot.

37:01.963 --> 37:04.454
<i>Let me talk to her, all right?</i>

37:09.937 --> 37:13.100
You're an outsider.
She'll listen to me.

37:16.010 --> 37:20.174
Don't take this the wrong way,
but what's in it for you?

37:20.248 --> 37:23.615
Maybe I want you to stick around,
at least visit.

37:23.685 --> 37:25.949
And what? Bring cookies
to my insane mother?

37:26.020 --> 37:28.147
Sure.

37:30.358 --> 37:32.292
Sorry...

37:32.360 --> 37:36.195
but Rachel, Isaac,
this whole cult thing...

37:36.265 --> 37:40.827
<i>- I don't think so.
- Jim Jones, David Koresh...</i>

37:42.604 --> 37:45.095
Hitler.

37:45.174 --> 37:48.541
They all came at the right time.
Why not Isaac?

37:48.610 --> 37:50.544
Hitler thought
he was the messiah.

37:52.247 --> 37:54.374
Oh, God.

37:57.419 --> 37:59.353
Still want to meet
your mama?

37:59.421 --> 38:02.254
Well, whose side
is she on?

38:06.862 --> 38:09.763
Okay. You've got
my attention.

38:18.974 --> 38:20.908
<i>Get some sleep.</i>

38:23.979 --> 38:25.913
Good night.

38:31.286 --> 38:34.312
I've had a long,
hard think, Rachel.

38:34.390 --> 38:37.757
I won't be needing you
to bring me dinner anymore.

38:37.827 --> 38:40.227
Who else is gonna do it?

38:40.296 --> 38:43.891
I'll get along.
It's time you did too.

38:43.967 --> 38:47.630
- After tonight.
- Nothing is going to happen.

38:47.704 --> 38:50.605
Then why is he awake?
Why is she here? Today?

38:54.844 --> 38:57.244
Then make it right.
Go to her.

39:04.521 --> 39:07.251
I never should've
given her up.

39:58.943 --> 40:02.811
Jake. Jake. Come on, Jake.
Let me help you.

40:02.880 --> 40:06.509
<i>Is that what you said
to Rachel?</i>

40:11.956 --> 40:16.393
Well, if it isn't
the medical miracle.

40:16.460 --> 40:18.826
It was Hannah's touch.

40:18.896 --> 40:22.354
- You leave that girl alone.
- You didn't.

40:22.433 --> 40:25.459
- You took her from her mother.
- I took her from this town.

40:25.536 --> 40:30.405
<i>- I wanted to give her a chance.
- And she's still mine.</i>

40:30.474 --> 40:32.408
You're sick.

40:43.220 --> 40:45.086
Are you ready to pay
for your actions?

40:45.156 --> 40:47.249
I've been paying for it
all my life.

40:52.831 --> 40:56.062
It's your soul that's
gonna burn in hell!

40:56.134 --> 40:58.500
I don't have a soul.

41:24.396 --> 41:27.229
<i>My son...</i>

41:32.237 --> 41:34.102
don't be afraid.

41:34.172 --> 41:36.697
<i>We've missed so much.</i>

41:36.775 --> 41:41.803
What should have been our life together
was yours alone, but it was his will.

41:43.682 --> 41:45.616
- Father, I, uh...
- Shh!

41:47.185 --> 41:51.714
I'm so proud of you:
My legacy...

41:51.791 --> 41:55.124
my child,
the firstborn son.

41:55.194 --> 41:57.856
I sacrificed for you...

41:57.930 --> 42:00.990
and I know you'll do
the same for your child.

42:01.067 --> 42:05.401
Tonight, the prophecy
will be fulfilled.

42:06.739 --> 42:10.505
You will father the child
that shall lead us all.

42:38.704 --> 42:41.366
- Brought you some towels.
- Well, you could have knocked.

42:41.440 --> 42:44.523
Some people do use
the "Do Not Disturb" sign.

42:44.724 --> 42:46.258
Is that all?

42:48.114 --> 42:50.844
- Gabriel wants you to meet somebody.
- Is he here?

42:50.916 --> 42:54.944
Uh, Hemingford.
It's about, um, 20 miles east.

42:55.022 --> 42:55.993
Well, where?

42:56.094 --> 42:59.990
A... coffee shop, as soon
as you can get there.

43:00.026 --> 43:02.224
- Well, which one?
- Get a clue.

43:02.295 --> 43:04.627
How many coffee shops
do you think there are?

43:24.051 --> 43:27.111
<i>You're a child
of the children, my children.</i>

43:28.455 --> 43:31.788
- You question me?
- What you're doing is wrong.

43:31.858 --> 43:34.725
Do you speak for the others
or only for yourself?

43:34.795 --> 43:37.195
I want what's best
for this town.

43:37.264 --> 43:39.198
Do you doubt
what is written?

43:40.834 --> 43:44.600
It's a new generation.
We don't believe anyone.

43:44.671 --> 43:48.163
<i>- I don't need to question. I have faith.
- I don't.</i>

43:48.241 --> 43:51.438
Why question when the answers
are right in front of you?

43:52.979 --> 43:55.949
Like in that book
you wrote?

43:56.017 --> 43:59.043
He filled me
with the words.

44:01.522 --> 44:04.013
You have faith that the planets
revolve around the sun...

44:04.092 --> 44:07.858
faith that the seeds
become the corn we harvest.

44:07.929 --> 44:11.956
<i>- Only because we planted those seeds.
- Directed by a force...</i>

44:12.033 --> 44:14.968
that moves the universe.

44:18.106 --> 44:20.097
I suppose you're
that force.

44:20.174 --> 44:22.540
The force is unseen.

44:22.610 --> 44:24.840
It moves through the hearts
and minds of people.

44:24.912 --> 44:27.039
Couldn't I be
that force?

44:27.115 --> 44:30.278
You know nothing.

44:30.351 --> 44:32.285
Buddha, Gandhi...

44:32.353 --> 44:36.312
even Jesus Christ,
had visions of a perfect world.

44:40.928 --> 44:43.954
My vision is absolute.

44:44.031 --> 44:47.125
And who ended up
nailed to a cross?

44:49.871 --> 44:52.203
Go...

44:52.273 --> 44:54.741
before you corrupt
my innocent children.

45:14.897 --> 45:19.664
What the hell?

45:19.735 --> 45:23.501
Shit!

45:36.652 --> 45:38.586
Are you crazy
or just stupid?

45:40.722 --> 45:43.020
God, you're drunk.

45:43.091 --> 45:45.025
You know, you could've
killed us both.

45:45.093 --> 45:48.392
It's the only way out...
for both of us!

45:51.433 --> 45:53.901
My car.

45:55.504 --> 45:58.598
<i>- And we're still not dead.
- Right. Real funny.</i>

45:58.674 --> 46:04.272
- Don't you get it?
- Yeah, and it's obviously about me.

46:04.347 --> 46:09.250
- Welcome to hell, Hannah.
- I'd rather be in Hemingford.

46:30.240 --> 46:35.405
<i>My lineage goes all the way back
to Isaac. Go find yours.</i>

46:39.983 --> 46:41.917
I didn't say anything!

46:43.887 --> 46:46.481
I didn't say a word.

47:32.136 --> 47:34.127
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

47:44.982 --> 47:47.314
<i>Hannah...</i>

47:50.754 --> 47:53.587
if you do this now,
there's no turning back.

47:53.657 --> 47:58.060
<i>Open that casket, and the first part
of the prophecy has come true.</i>

47:58.128 --> 48:00.653
Just go.

48:02.833 --> 48:04.926
Then tell me the truth.

48:08.606 --> 48:11.939
The truth is... repulsive.

48:21.086 --> 48:22.951
Your visions are real.

48:27.659 --> 48:29.684
<i>The firstborn daughter
of the children will return...</i>

48:29.761 --> 48:33.458
<i>on the eve of her 19th birthday
to find out who she is...</i>

48:36.368 --> 48:39.064
<i>and He Who Walks
Behind the Rows will awaken.</i>

48:44.109 --> 48:46.737
- I had no choice.
- I belonged with you.

48:48.346 --> 48:50.439
And Isaac?

48:51.683 --> 48:54.243
I couldn't
take that risk.

48:54.319 --> 48:56.253
<i>Go back to your parents.</i>

48:56.321 --> 48:59.256
<i>- So you didn't want me.
- I wanted you!</i>

48:59.324 --> 49:01.986
I wanted you so badly!

49:02.060 --> 49:06.053
- But you're my mother.
- Yes.

49:10.402 --> 49:12.371
Is Isaac my father?

49:12.438 --> 49:15.737
No. Isaac killed him too.
A sacrifice to the cult.

49:15.808 --> 49:19.835
- Why all these lies?
- It's the only way he would have no power.

49:19.912 --> 49:21.777
To do what?

49:23.983 --> 49:26.451
I mean, why don't you just
tell me and let me decide?

49:31.390 --> 49:34.325
He wants you to be the mother
of a superior race...

49:34.393 --> 49:38.591
<i>and the prophecy says
you decide to do it.</i>

49:38.664 --> 49:40.598
You're insane.

49:41.667 --> 49:43.692
<i>You're all insane.</i>

49:43.769 --> 49:45.703
It was a mistake
for you to come here.

49:47.273 --> 49:49.207
You're a mistake.

50:24.678 --> 50:27.340
Behold...

50:27.414 --> 50:31.350
<i>now is the accepted time.</i>

50:31.418 --> 50:33.784
Now is the day
of salvation.

50:34.921 --> 50:37.253
Begin with the mark
of the chosen.

50:49.569 --> 50:52.333
To whom much is given...

50:52.405 --> 50:54.600
much is expected.

51:02.749 --> 51:05.946
- Embrace your birthright.
- Embrace your birthright.

51:06.019 --> 51:07.953
<i>Embrace your birthright.</i>

51:08.021 --> 51:10.046
<i>Embrace your birthright.</i>

51:10.123 --> 51:14.423
<i>Embrace your birthright.
Embrace your birthright.</i>

51:28.943 --> 51:31.639
<i>Oh, well.</i>

51:46.327 --> 51:48.522
<i>You should be happy
by yourself now.</i>

51:48.596 --> 51:50.723
<i>What's up, beast?</i>

51:52.333 --> 51:55.097
Destiny. Destiny.

51:57.338 --> 52:00.000
<i>What are you gonna do now?</i>

52:00.074 --> 52:04.238
Destiny. Destiny. Destiny.
- What?

52:04.312 --> 52:07.145
<i>- Hey! Look out!
- What do you guys want?</i>

52:07.215 --> 52:10.150
- Destiny. Destiny. Destiny.
- Would you leave me alone?

52:10.218 --> 52:12.948
What do you want?

52:13.020 --> 52:16.183
<i>Are you scared now?
- God, you guys are freaks!</i>

52:16.257 --> 52:18.418
What is it with this place?
Get away!

52:18.492 --> 52:21.690
<i>- It's you.
- Would you leave me alone?</i>

52:41.550 --> 52:43.814
Welcome, child.

52:43.885 --> 52:47.013
Blessed is this day,
for your gift is great and wondrous.

52:54.463 --> 52:57.591
<i>I call upon He Who Walks
Behind the Rows...</i>

52:57.666 --> 52:59.861
giver of all life.

53:03.739 --> 53:06.503
<i>Set forth thy law
of force and fire.</i>

53:06.575 --> 53:09.908
Embrace your birthright.
Embrace your birthright.

53:09.978 --> 53:11.912
Oww. Oww.

53:25.094 --> 53:28.063
Sanctify this
union of souls...

53:28.131 --> 53:32.568
as first son and first daughter
beget the children of the chosen.

53:32.635 --> 53:35.900
<i>As the prophecy is written,
so it shall be.</i>

53:39.776 --> 53:44.611
No. Run! Run!

53:46.416 --> 53:48.509
Cora, leave them.

53:51.120 --> 53:53.714
<i>Get her. That way!</i>

53:58.494 --> 54:01.088
<i>I see you!</i>

54:04.667 --> 54:08.228
<i>- Come on! To the left.
- There she is.</i>

54:12.542 --> 54:14.874
<i>I got ya now!</i>

54:14.944 --> 54:16.878
<i>Flood her out!
Flood her out!</i>

54:24.620 --> 54:28.614
<i>I hope you can swim, sweet one!</i>

54:28.692 --> 54:33.561
<i>There you are.</i>

54:38.902 --> 54:42.338
Now do you see for yourselves?
He's a fraud.

54:42.406 --> 54:47.241
It's almost midnight and your
prophecies never come to pass.

54:56.253 --> 54:58.312
Time's up.

54:59.757 --> 55:02.317
Don't underestimate
the power of my vision.

55:02.393 --> 55:07.421
The only power you have
is the power we give you.

55:10.067 --> 55:12.331
<i>- She's a liar!
- Take her.</i>

55:17.508 --> 55:19.635
<i>Where ya goin' Hannah?</i>

55:21.845 --> 55:25.804
Shh.

55:25.883 --> 55:28.545
Come to Daddy.

55:28.619 --> 55:30.610
Where are ya?

55:30.687 --> 55:32.952
You can't hide from us!

55:42.333 --> 55:45.325
<i>Ooh! I got you!</i>

55:49.307 --> 55:53.744
- Why are you doing this?
- For Matt.

55:53.812 --> 55:56.372
- For me.
- Hey, lady!

55:56.448 --> 55:59.747
<i>Hi, lady.</i>

55:59.818 --> 56:02.150
Go! Run!

56:03.488 --> 56:05.854
- Which way? Which way now?
- Okay.

56:05.924 --> 56:09.360
Yeah. We'll go this way.
This way.

56:09.427 --> 56:11.657
Get away!

56:11.729 --> 56:15.688
No! Go... Go away!

56:20.138 --> 56:22.072
Get away!

56:25.176 --> 56:27.337
<i>Stay back there!</i>

56:27.412 --> 56:29.676
Take them to Isaac!

56:29.747 --> 56:31.681
- Come here!
- Let go!

56:33.785 --> 56:37.085
<i>Come on, we mustn't
keep Isaac waiting.</i>

56:38.824 --> 56:40.724
Come on. Move it, girl.

56:40.793 --> 56:43.594
Where is she?

56:43.662 --> 56:45.963
I saw her get on one of the bikes.
I mean she should be here.

56:46.164 --> 56:46.900
Idiot!

56:57.776 --> 57:00.210
Hannah!

57:01.447 --> 57:03.881
It's me.

57:05.050 --> 57:08.383
It's okay.
It's okay. It's me.

57:09.622 --> 57:12.216
It's okay.

57:17.162 --> 57:20.222
It's okay. It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

57:21.300 --> 57:23.598
Shh. Shh. Shh.

57:30.209 --> 57:32.143
It's gonna be okay.

57:33.812 --> 57:35.746
<i>Heretic.</i>

57:40.487 --> 57:43.320
Kill her.

57:52.465 --> 57:56.196
Better you were never born
than to have disappointed me so.

58:03.009 --> 58:04.943
Not one of you?

58:06.580 --> 58:09.743
In the name of
He Who Walks Behind the Rows...

58:11.451 --> 58:14.113
I will execute
the judgment.

58:18.558 --> 58:21.322
Matt.

58:26.533 --> 58:28.330
Finish it.

58:29.436 --> 58:32.872
<i>All right!</i>

58:36.409 --> 58:38.309
<i>Whoa!</i>

58:52.059 --> 58:55.495
Your strength
shall be rewarded.

01:00:03.699 --> 01:00:06.497
<i>I'd give anything
for a shower right now.</i>

01:00:28.323 --> 01:00:30.257
Okay, switch.

01:00:37.332 --> 01:00:40.995
Keep your eyes
on the clothes.

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:46.735
Oh, yes.

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:45.088
Here. Here.
Here. Here you go.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:56.297
<i>Now I know why
she gave me away.</i>

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:02.343
Please. Please help.

01:03:02.413 --> 01:03:05.940
What the fuck?

01:03:08.419 --> 01:03:11.479
Beware of He Who Picks the Corn.

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:18.829
You think you trashed his sacred
prophecy, but this is all part of it.

01:03:19.898 --> 01:03:22.025
I didn't turn
that steering wheel.

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:24.261
What has he done
with my mother?

01:03:34.679 --> 01:03:37.011
She was protecting me.

01:03:37.081 --> 01:03:39.515
<i>We'll find her.</i>

01:03:55.934 --> 01:03:58.403
<i>Aren't they beautiful?</i>

01:04:03.876 --> 01:04:05.810
Took years
to collect them.

01:04:09.315 --> 01:04:11.249
You only need one.

01:04:16.221 --> 01:04:20.180
You'll be with her.
I promise.

01:04:48.887 --> 01:04:51.014
Don't let me down.

01:05:01.167 --> 01:05:03.101
Is he gonna be okay?

01:05:04.571 --> 01:05:07.734
Just fine.

01:05:13.179 --> 01:05:15.977
<i>#Your ignorance
Your blindness #</i>

01:05:16.049 --> 01:05:18.779
<i>#Your greed
Your progress #</i>

01:05:18.852 --> 01:05:21.582
<i>#Your conquest
Your mania#</i>

01:05:21.654 --> 01:05:24.623
<i>#Your need
Your sorrow #</i>

01:05:24.691 --> 01:05:28.422
<i>#Your sickness
Your final parting breath #</i>

01:05:28.495 --> 01:05:31.430
<i>#Your hatred
Your bloodshed #</i>

01:05:31.498 --> 01:05:35.867
<i>#Your future Your

01:05:35.935 --> 01:05:41.430
<i>#I will have none
I will have none#</i>

01:05:41.508 --> 01:05:43.738
<i>#I will have none #</i>

01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:49.305
<i>#I, dreaded lord of shadows
with broken spell #</i>

01:05:49.382 --> 01:05:52.112
<i>#Unto this rotting age #</i>

01:05:52.185 --> 01:05:55.154
<i>#I bid farewell #</i>

01:05:56.790 --> 01:06:01.693
<i>#The faith #</i>

01:06:10.938 --> 01:06:12.872
It'll be all right.

01:06:49.376 --> 01:06:52.140
- What'd you do to the doc?
- It was quick.

01:06:57.084 --> 01:07:01.521
You used to be smart,
loyal. I trusted you.

01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:04.649
Hannah was lucky
she didn't have you for a mother.

01:07:13.168 --> 01:07:15.102
She won't come.

01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:17.195
She'll come.

01:07:17.272 --> 01:07:20.002
Her visions are
borne of pain.

01:07:25.213 --> 01:07:27.408
<i>You can't escape
the prophecy.</i>

01:07:36.191 --> 01:07:39.217
Feel that one, Hannah?

01:08:16.666 --> 01:08:19.635
Beware of false prophets,
sheep's clothing, ravening wolves.

01:08:19.702 --> 01:08:23.502
Ravening wolves.
Ravening wolves.

01:08:23.573 --> 01:08:28.203
Beware of false prophets, sheep's
clothing, ravening wolves. Ravening wolves.

01:08:28.277 --> 01:08:32.236
Beware of false prophets, sheep's
clothing, ravening wolves. Ravening wolves.

01:08:43.292 --> 01:08:46.193
You are so dead.

01:08:48.598 --> 01:08:52.500
Beware of false prophets,
sheep's clothing, ravening wolves.

01:08:52.568 --> 01:08:56.470
Beware of false prophets, sheep's
clothing, ravening wolves. Ravening wolves.

01:09:38.548 --> 01:09:41.278
Isaac!

01:09:49.158 --> 01:09:51.252
Isaac.

01:09:52.763 --> 01:09:54.958
The Lord came to me in a dream.

01:09:55.032 --> 01:09:57.023
<i>And what didHe command?</i>

01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.398
That I shall
take her myself.

01:09:59.469 --> 01:10:04.907
<i>Instead of harmony and peace,
he just took our souls.</i>

01:10:04.975 --> 01:10:07.000
Don't hurt my child.

01:10:07.077 --> 01:10:11.537
What's one soul compared
to the new order she'll be creating?

01:10:17.789 --> 01:10:22.249
- You can't escape the prophecy.
- There is no prophecy.

01:10:22.327 --> 01:10:25.125
Your mother gave up
her chance.

01:10:25.196 --> 01:10:27.460
<i>Don't do the same.</i>

01:10:30.802 --> 01:10:33.703
Did you kill my father?

01:10:35.073 --> 01:10:38.600
He sacrificed his life
to a power greater than himself.

01:10:41.512 --> 01:10:45.972
- He Who Walks Behind the Rows?
- No. Me.

01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:52.146
Come, Hannah.

01:10:52.223 --> 01:10:54.384
<i>Don't ignore your visions.</i>

01:10:54.459 --> 01:10:58.156
I'm your true family.

01:10:59.230 --> 01:11:01.164
You belong with me.

01:11:05.403 --> 01:11:07.337
This is for Isaac.

01:11:17.749 --> 01:11:20.309
<i>Bang.</i>

01:11:37.603 --> 01:11:40.094
Now this is fuckin'- A!

01:11:41.874 --> 01:11:44.502
- It's over, old man.
- You defied me!

01:11:44.576 --> 01:11:47.443
- You denied my birthright.
- Liar.

01:11:47.513 --> 01:11:49.640
Am I, Isaac?

01:11:49.715 --> 01:11:53.344
Aren't I the firstborn? You rejected
me so that your son could take my place.

01:11:53.419 --> 01:11:56.855
- Enough.
- How dare you castrate my words, you fuck!

01:11:56.922 --> 01:11:58.626
I am the giver of his word!

01:11:58.627 --> 01:12:01.885
First son and first daughter
was my prophecy...

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.494
and it was fulfilled!

01:12:12.004 --> 01:12:14.996
Do it, Hannah.
End the evil.

01:12:19.445 --> 01:12:21.504
Go on. Kill 'im.

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.707
It can't be you.

01:12:28.254 --> 01:12:30.654
Don't.

01:12:46.973 --> 01:12:50.238
Okay. All right.
Okay. All right.

01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:53.939
Okay. Just-Just touch 'im.
I'll do the rest.

01:13:02.021 --> 01:13:05.422
Don't be scared.
You did everything perfectly.

01:13:05.492 --> 01:13:07.619
Gabriel.

01:13:07.694 --> 01:13:10.857
I couldn't have planned
it better myself.

01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:12.989
But, then again...

01:13:13.066 --> 01:13:15.000
we were destined.

01:13:18.771 --> 01:13:22.104
You...
I wanna see grovel.

01:13:23.543 --> 01:13:27.707
On your knees, bitch.

01:13:32.386 --> 01:13:34.846
He Who Walks
Behind the Rows.

01:13:34.922 --> 01:13:38.265
Who the fuck is He Who
Walks Behind the Rows?

01:13:38.666 --> 01:13:39.738
Me.

01:13:52.006 --> 01:13:55.100
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to...

01:13:55.175 --> 01:13:57.769
"It's Your Death"!

01:13:57.845 --> 01:13:59.904
Prepare to pass judgment.

01:14:01.348 --> 01:14:05.910
Isaac, how would you deal
with a liar and a betrayer?

01:14:05.986 --> 01:14:08.614
Every man shall die
for his sins.

01:14:08.689 --> 01:14:13.683
- What-What was that? L- I'm
sorry, I missed that. - Damn you.

01:14:13.761 --> 01:14:16.787
Did you kiss your mother
with that mouth?

01:14:16.864 --> 01:14:19.492
<i>That is not the answer
we're looking for.</i>

01:14:19.567 --> 01:14:21.501
Not afraid to die,
are ya, Isaac?

01:14:23.504 --> 01:14:25.734
Oh, yeah.

01:14:25.806 --> 01:14:28.673
That's right.
You've got faith.

01:14:32.347 --> 01:14:35.805
We have to end this.

01:14:35.884 --> 01:14:39.342
Thanks for playing. We've got
some lovely parting gifts for you.

01:14:51.032 --> 01:14:52.966
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:14:58.607 --> 01:15:00.871
Come with me now.

01:15:02.777 --> 01:15:05.041
Isn't this what you wanted?
Now you know who you are.

01:15:11.886 --> 01:15:14.480
The seed has
already been sown.

01:15:38.948 --> 01:15:43.681
<i>Come on. Let's go.
Come with me. Come on.</i>

01:15:46.455 --> 01:15:49.947
<i>Hurry up.
Go. Go. Go.</i>

01:16:11.547 --> 01:16:13.708
- Leave him.
- No.

01:16:19.221 --> 01:16:21.086
No. No. No.

01:16:30.833 --> 01:16:33.393
Damn fine performance,
if I do say so myself.

01:16:43.346 --> 01:16:45.280
Boom.

01:17:03.867 --> 01:17:06.131
<i>The seed has
already been sown.</i>

01:17:08.705 --> 01:17:11.868
<i>And Hannah said,
"I am a woman of sorrowful spirit.</i>

01:17:11.942 --> 01:17:16.845
<i>If thou wilt give me a son, I will give him
unto the Lord all the days of his life. "</i>

01:17:16.913 --> 01:17:21.179
<i>Well, maybe that's true,
but my truth is something else...</i>

01:17:21.251 --> 01:17:26.120
<i>something dark, unknowable,
hideous and corrupt.</i>

01:17:26.189 --> 01:17:28.589
<i>It lives under
the cracked asphalt...</i>

01:17:28.658 --> 01:17:31.286
<i>and the endless
rows of corn...</i>

01:17:33.096 --> 01:17:35.257
<i>and now it lives in me.</i>

01:18:50.976 --> 01:18:55.777
<i>#There was a gentle angler#</i>

01:18:55.848 --> 01:19:02.083

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:08.218
<i>#With heart as cold

01:19:08.293 --> 01:19:13.560
<i>#Untaught of love can be #</i>

01:19:13.632 --> 01:19:19.434
<i>#When suddenly
the waters rushed #</i>

01:19:19.504 --> 01:19:24.942
<i>#And swelled
and up there sprang#</i>

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:27.672
<i>#Ahumid maid #</i>
