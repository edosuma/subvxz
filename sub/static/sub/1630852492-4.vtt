00:02.503 --> 00:04.102
- I think we need to talk
about boundaries.

00:04.238 --> 00:06.137
- What's the problem?
You said you'd be there for me.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.273
- Colleagues don't shove semen

00:08.409 --> 00:10.208
Into other colleagues' vaginas,
traditionally.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.877
- You can't just put her
in a car without a car seat!

00:12.913 --> 00:14.980
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.
- You know, honestly, sloane,

00:14.982 --> 00:17.082
I am not sure you're cut out
to be a mother.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.917
(sheet rustles)

00:18.919 --> 00:21.253
- It's a proposal of an expose
about multi-level

00:21.322 --> 00:23.822
Marketing companies.
- What, like pyramid schemes?

00:23.957 --> 00:25.690
- Yeah, this shit's insidious.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.297

00:33.401 --> 00:35.300
- Is this a joke?!
- It's called a pivot.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.202
- This is my kid that
you're talking about,

00:37.204 --> 00:38.903
This is my little--
- okay. Okay.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.672
- Your book might actually
sell now,

00:40.708 --> 00:42.240
How about a thank you?
- Fuck you.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.010
(children laugh and shout)

00:46.047 --> 00:49.348
- Welcome to the inaugural
"val's pals," everyone!

00:49.350 --> 00:51.550
- I can't believe you dragged
us back to "mommy and me".

00:51.552 --> 00:53.285
- No, no, no, this is not
"mommy and me".

00:53.287 --> 00:55.687
This is val's pals, tm.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.624
The kids are free to join, but
this is really about the pals.

00:58.626 --> 01:01.226
- Last I checked, I didn't
have to pay for my pals.

01:01.228 --> 01:03.361
- Yeah, val, you've somehow
monetized friendship.

01:03.363 --> 01:04.863
- I'm a very good friend.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.365
- Yeah, I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.033
- Look--no, wait!
Here's something fun,

01:08.168 --> 01:10.769
Just for the pals...
Husband swap,

01:12.373 --> 01:14.106
- I'm not gonna play this!
- Lionel, right?

01:14.241 --> 01:16.040
- What the fuck did you
just say?!

01:16.077 --> 01:17.476
- Okay, maybe I pushed
a button there.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.043
- Yeah, this has been real.
Thanks.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.013
- No wait! I got you something!

01:23.951 --> 01:25.818
- (sighs) okay.

01:26.921 --> 01:28.487
What is this?

01:28.489 --> 01:30.856
- It's an invitation
to my birthday!

01:30.925 --> 01:32.524
It's the big one!

01:32.560 --> 01:35.360
- An invitation to nothing?
- Yeah, it's blank. (scoff)

01:35.496 --> 01:38.330
- I was kinda hoping you two
could plan something.

01:38.332 --> 01:41.065
- Ohhh!
- Oh wow.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.102
- It'd be nice.

01:44.105 --> 01:46.972
- We were just-we were already
uh, talking about it.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.274
- Invite lionel.
- What the fuck?!

02:53.574 --> 02:55.607
She-she probably doesn't even
remember, it's the truth.

02:55.742 --> 02:58.510
Val: Sloane, I've heard
so much about you!

02:58.579 --> 03:00.311
- Hey, bestseller.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.216
- Okay, so she remembered,
but listen,

03:04.218 --> 03:06.818
Just keep it together for val,

03:13.560 --> 03:15.694
We have aromatherapy,
deep tissue,

03:15.763 --> 03:17.496
And thai massage.
- You hear that?

03:17.498 --> 03:19.298
Maybe someone can finally
massage the bitch out of you.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.366
- I'll massage the bitch
out of you.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.168
- Good luck.
Symone: Ahem!

03:23.237 --> 03:26.404
A gentle reminder that the club

03:26.440 --> 03:29.408
To ensure peace and tranquility
for all our guests.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.977
- Hey, what were you thinking
inviting her?

03:33.013 --> 03:34.513
- Look, I know she's not
your favourite person.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.514
- No shit! I'd rather
let jayme cut my hair

03:36.550 --> 03:38.450
Than hang out with that
wide-awake nightmare.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.852
I know you guys are co-workers,
but she sucks, dude.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.121
She just says whatever
she's thinking. It's a lot.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.523
- Yeah, it kinda reminds me
of another person in my life.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.326
- Okay.
- Look, today is about val.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.462
Okay? And whatever birthday
val is having.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.631
So I need you to try,
all right?

03:53.934 --> 03:55.734
Truth be told, I don't totally
know how to act

03:55.736 --> 03:57.368
Around sloane today, either.
- What do you mean?

03:57.404 --> 03:59.404
I thought you guys
were cool now.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.539
- I um, I may have put us
in a...

04:02.676 --> 04:05.009
Conflict of interest situation.
Hmm.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.377
- What?

04:06.413 --> 04:08.346
- Uh, let's just say there
was like, a fire,

04:08.415 --> 04:10.449
And I put out the fire,
it's gone.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.551
And I don't know
if I should tell her

04:12.686 --> 04:15.086
About the fire
that I put out.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.622
- I genuinely hate
your analogies.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.290
- Yeah.
- If there's no fire,

04:18.425 --> 04:20.925
Why sound the alarm?
- Right. Exactly.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.095
I'm not gonna tell her.
- Great. Okay.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.763
Let's go get pretzeled
by some russians.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.231
- Yeah.

04:28.002 --> 04:30.168
(soft music plays)

04:30.237 --> 04:33.971
- No need to stay so north
of the border, my good man.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.973
- Typically we start
with the shoulders.

04:36.010 --> 04:38.376
- Do whatever you need to do
to get the tension out.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.645
Remember, this body
is a wonderland.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.914
- You know, I'm not really
supposed to say this,

04:42.916 --> 04:45.784
But you have beautiful
shoulders.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.686
- Yeah, yeah,
just get the job done.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.589
- What do you think
of these shoulders?

04:51.625 --> 04:53.525
- Uh, they're-they're fine.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.927
- Fine, or like... Fiiine?

04:57.197 --> 04:59.030
- Can you focus on my neck,
that's where I hold

04:59.033 --> 05:00.598
All my tension.
Masseur: Mm-hmm.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.001
- Speaking of tension,
did you see the look

05:03.003 --> 05:04.536
On anne's face when
you walked up?

05:04.671 --> 05:06.604
What got a bee in her bonnet?

05:06.606 --> 05:08.807
- Don't get me wrong,
I love me a sour bitch,

05:08.809 --> 05:10.742
But I prefer the fun kind.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.277
Unfortunately, she never
holds back, you know?

05:13.314 --> 05:15.613
- Yeah, I know.

05:15.649 --> 05:19.351
- You have absolutely
incredible skin elasticity.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.119
It's-it's like touching
a newborn.

05:21.254 --> 05:22.754
- So I've been told.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.725
- I too am... Hot?

05:26.860 --> 05:28.727
- Oh, I can adjust
the temperature for you.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.196
Masseur: Ooh! And your arms,
they're so supple.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.236
- (sighs heavily)

05:38.372 --> 05:40.638

are you hard?

05:40.708 --> 05:42.774

- Well, yes, you are,

perfectly natural.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.779

all the beautiful women.

07:41.661 --> 07:43.695
Middling sales at best?

You wouldn't need to rely
on hack marketing!

weren't such an asshole

sorry.

come here to be attacked!

17:33.086 --> 17:35.219
And in two minutes, this little
test will prove it.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.020
- Okay, because if you are--

17:37.057 --> 17:38.689
- I told you, I'm not.
I can't be.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.691
- Well, those are two
different things.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.493
- I'm not pregnant.
I shouldn't be, anyway.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.296
- What do you mean?

17:45.365 --> 17:47.231
- Well, I don't have what
it takes to be a mother.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.366
- What?
- The fuck?!

17:49.368 --> 17:51.401
Who the fuck told you that?
That doesn't sound like you.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.071
- Not at all.
- Look, if you are pregnant,

17:54.107 --> 17:55.906
Your kid's gonna be a dick,
just like you.

17:55.975 --> 17:58.042
- Okay.
- What the fuck?

17:58.111 --> 17:59.844
- That's a step backwards,
my friend.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.180
- What I'm trying to say is,
the one thing I know

18:02.315 --> 18:04.948
About difficult people...
- Excuse me?

18:04.984 --> 18:07.385
- Is that we make great moms.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.988
Headstrong, opinionated,
asshole women

18:11.123 --> 18:13.524
Make headstrong, opinionated,
asshole kids.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.226
And that's not a bad thing.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.162
It's the one reason I know that

18:18.297 --> 18:20.631
Alice is gonna be okay
in this world.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.602
- Well, I appreciate the pep
talk, ladies, but again,

18:24.604 --> 18:26.537
Not pregnant.
- But if you are,

18:26.606 --> 18:28.739
I'd throw money down
that you'd be great at it.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.475
(traffic hums in the distance)

18:31.478 --> 18:33.243
(birds chirp)

18:34.481 --> 18:36.947
- Valeria! I almost forgot,
I got you something!

18:36.949 --> 18:38.816
- Oh no, save your pregnancy
test, kate.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.484
I love condoms.
- What?

18:40.487 --> 18:42.319
- Yeah, can't get enough of 'em.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.155
They just make it feel better.

18:44.157 --> 18:45.690
You know, actually,
I'm addicted.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.558
And honestly, I can't come
without 'em, call me nuts.

18:47.693 --> 18:49.126
- I got you a cupcake.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.761
- Oh my god, even better,
I love cupcakes.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.430
- (laughs)
I know it's not a cake,

18:52.565 --> 18:54.565
But I figured a-a birthday
of um...

18:54.601 --> 18:56.367
This magnitude...
- Oh, yes!

18:56.502 --> 18:59.269
- And that birthday is...

19:01.641 --> 19:03.440
- Do neither of you know
how old I am?

19:03.576 --> 19:05.309
- No, we do, we do,
we totally do.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.277
We just were hoping you
were gonna say it.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.913
- Good, so you know
I'm turning...

19:09.949 --> 19:11.515
- 38.
- 50.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.417
- Did you just say 70?
- Did you say 28?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.385
- No, I said 38.
- 38?

19:15.387 --> 19:17.221
I thought you said
it was the big one!

19:17.356 --> 19:19.457
- It is the big one. Well,
the big one before the big one.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.659
- Well, that's--
- 38 is your last good year.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.794
39 is just a slip 'n slide
to 40.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.063
And 40 is the big, big one.

19:26.132 --> 19:27.398
And then it's a crapshoot
after that.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.300
