WEBVTT

01:40.992 --> 01:43.362
Alright dude, time to get up.

01:45.032 --> 01:46.252
Come on, Rigby.

01:47.812 --> 01:50.182
Dude, get up. We got to get ready for work.

01:50.222 --> 01:51.562
Okay. Okay.

01:52.202 --> 01:53.682
Dude, this is so cool.

01:53.802 --> 01:56.022
I never got a job that got you a place to live.

01:56.022 --> 01:57.542
I never even had a job.

02:00.472 --> 02:02.082
Yeah, about that.

02:02.082 --> 02:04.182
I kinda told them you'd be a good idea to hire,

02:04.182 --> 02:06.682
so can you try not to do the whole "Rigby thing".

02:06.682 --> 02:08.622
"Rigby thing"? What do you mean?

02:08.622 --> 02:09.762
I mean you're lazy.

02:09.842 --> 02:11.602
What? I'm not lazy.

02:11.602 --> 02:14.332
Dude, you were lazy to fill up the application for this job.

02:14.332 --> 02:16.142
That's why I have to do it in the first place.

02:16.142 --> 02:18.192
Just cause I was too lazy to do something boring

02:18.192 --> 02:20.352
like filling in a job application doesn't mean I'm lazy.

02:20.352 --> 02:22.012
Okay. Okay. Look.

02:22.082 --> 02:24.532
Let's just both promise that starting right now

02:24.532 --> 02:27.062
we're not gonna do anything to screw this up. Okay?

02:27.552 --> 02:29.832
Okay. You think there's breakfast stuff in the kitchen?

02:30.772 --> 02:32.272
Only one way to find out.

02:35.132 --> 02:36.832
...Milk.

02:39.342 --> 02:40.702
...Cereal.

02:43.172 --> 02:45.022
...Combine.

02:48.312 --> 02:50.012
This is the only clean spoon left dude.

02:50.012 --> 02:51.532
Let's play "Punchies" for it.

02:51.752 --> 02:53.602
Okay. Me first.

03:00.832 --> 03:01.852
Take it.

03:03.832 --> 03:04.762
Man,

03:05.272 --> 03:07.052
so far this job is awesome!

03:07.132 --> 03:09.162
I still can't believe we get our own rooms!

03:09.222 --> 03:11.612
Dude, those rooms aren't cool. There's nothing in them.

03:11.612 --> 03:13.372
I had to sleep on the floor last night.

03:14.492 --> 03:15.922
Will yeah I mean.

03:15.922 --> 03:18.392
We could get some stuff for by earning some money. You know?

03:18.442 --> 03:19.632
I guess.

03:20.102 --> 03:21.362
You want some milk.

03:21.762 --> 03:22.762
Yeah.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.562
Please don't eat up in the table like that.

03:27.832 --> 03:28.912
Like what?

03:32.132 --> 03:35.342
Oh my. I never seen anyone eating cereal like that.

03:35.542 --> 03:36.882
How quaint!

03:36.922 --> 03:38.672
Yeah, well they shouldn't be doing that.

03:38.672 --> 03:40.012
That's what the bowls are for.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.272
Oh, they're fine!

03:42.412 --> 03:44.912
- ...Did you see that chair? - I love chairs...

03:48.522 --> 03:50.332
Hey, Pops! What are you doing with that chair?

03:50.442 --> 03:53.592
Oh, well. I no longer require its services.

03:53.622 --> 03:56.172
So, Benson & I are taking it to the place

03:56.172 --> 04:00.992
where the big man-made come upon & wisk it away to magic trash city!

04:02.472 --> 04:03.742
We're throwing it away.

04:03.762 --> 04:04.582
Aw, what?

04:04.582 --> 04:07.312
Yeah, why would you throw that thing out? It looks awesome.

04:07.312 --> 04:09.132
Can we at least check it out, before you chuck it?

04:09.132 --> 04:10.702
Yeah, can we at least check it, before you chuck.

04:11.612 --> 04:13.472
Oh, that would be fine.

04:15.562 --> 04:16.742
Look, I gotta get back to work.

04:16.742 --> 04:18.392
You guys help him throw it away when you're done.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.402
Aw, man this chair is awesome.

04:20.432 --> 04:22.402
Look how awesome it looks.

04:22.452 --> 04:24.812
Dude, it sounds like old man pants.

04:28.022 --> 04:29.142
I'm gonna sit in it.

04:29.142 --> 04:30.002
Good idea.

04:35.472 --> 04:36.442
What? What's wrong?

04:41.742 --> 04:43.742
Dude, this is the most uncomfortable chair I ever sat in.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.272
Aw, what? Let me try it.

04:45.562 --> 04:47.472
Yes, I'm afraid it's true.

04:47.492 --> 04:51.942
I purchased it through the post and it just isn't as comfortable as it looks.

04:53.472 --> 04:54.732
This is terrible.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.932
Maybe we're just not sitting it right.

04:58.092 --> 05:01.262
Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Come on, come on, baby!

05:04.322 --> 05:05.652
It's just not comfortable, man.

05:05.652 --> 05:07.912
If you ask me, I think we should throw it away.

05:07.952 --> 05:10.802
Oh, well, yes, that's what I'm on my way to do.

05:10.802 --> 05:13.112
Hey, Pops. Since you're throwing it out anyway, can I just have it?

05:13.112 --> 05:15.082
- No, let me have it! - I asked him first.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.692
- Come on, Pops! - No, Pops, me!

05:16.692 --> 05:19.832
Well, I don't think I know who to give it to.

05:19.832 --> 05:22.932
But if you two can settle it between yourselves,

05:22.932 --> 05:25.382
then you're more than welcome to have it.

05:25.382 --> 05:27.452
Yeah, let's play punches.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.622
No way! I'm not playing that game with you anymore.

05:29.622 --> 05:31.442
If we're playing for something like that chair,

05:31.442 --> 05:34.352
then we need to play a game that takes a little more skill.

05:34.422 --> 05:35.882
How much skill?

05:35.882 --> 05:37.852
Rock paper scissors.

05:37.952 --> 05:41.272
I adore rock paper scissors.

05:41.272 --> 05:45.992
Although where I come from, we called it quartz parchment shears.

05:46.762 --> 05:48.062
Alright, how do you wanna play it.

05:48.062 --> 05:50.492
Are we go in a one-two-three go?

05:50.502 --> 05:52.492
Or one-two-three, shoot on three?

05:52.492 --> 05:53.542
Let's do it on three.

05:53.612 --> 05:55.782
Alright, fine. But let's stretch first.

05:55.782 --> 05:57.602
I don't wanna put my ham or whatever.

05:57.602 --> 05:58.282
Okay.

06:03.322 --> 06:05.242
What's up with the new guys?

06:05.242 --> 06:10.072
They're ready to play quartz parchment shears for my old Silounna.

06:10.122 --> 06:11.422
Nice.

06:13.082 --> 06:17.852
You know who else gonna play quartz parchment shears for your old Silounna?

06:17.852 --> 06:18.802
Who?

06:18.882 --> 06:20.802
My mom!

06:22.932 --> 06:25.982
See? I told you I was gonna say it!

06:26.022 --> 06:27.332
Ready?

06:29.952 --> 06:31.202
Oh, my!

06:34.692 --> 06:38.502
Shouldn't you guys be throwing that thing away?

06:38.502 --> 06:40.132
Benson, come quick!

06:40.172 --> 06:46.632
Quartz parchment shears and they already tied two times, it's absolutely fascinating!

06:46.682 --> 06:48.162
I have work to do.

06:48.162 --> 06:51.552
And they shouldn't be playing that. It's an evil game.

06:52.022 --> 06:54.172
Whoo, an evil game.

06:54.172 --> 06:55.192
Two ties.

06:55.242 --> 06:57.362
You don't know what I'm throwing next, baby!

06:57.982 --> 07:00.862
I already know what you're throwing before you even throw it, baby!

07:00.862 --> 07:02.862
That's not even possible, baby!

07:10.222 --> 07:11.482
Come on!

07:11.482 --> 07:14.602
Good show, jolly good show!

07:14.762 --> 07:16.412
Everyone come quick!

07:16.412 --> 07:21.102
The most amazing game of quartz parchment shears is happening right now!

07:48.842 --> 07:50.432
No, no!

07:50.502 --> 07:53.462
99 ties in a row!

07:55.322 --> 07:55.992
Enough!

07:56.142 --> 07:57.732
Why are we even doing this?

07:57.732 --> 07:59.492
You don't even think this chair comfortable.

07:59.492 --> 08:00.962
So? neither do you!

08:01.012 --> 08:02.722
Dude, I was lying.

08:03.002 --> 08:05.262
I was just saying that, so you wouldn't want it.

08:05.312 --> 08:09.052
I was lying also, I love that chair.

08:09.052 --> 08:12.042
Well, then I guess it's too bad that after I win it.

08:12.042 --> 08:14.492
I'm never letting you sit it.

08:15.042 --> 08:16.502
Then finish it!

08:20.762 --> 08:23.242
Since no one can decide,

08:23.252 --> 08:27.972
and all these playies tied 100 times,

08:28.202 --> 08:33.542
I take it upon myself to eat your prize.

08:36.142 --> 08:37.422
What's that?

08:37.462 --> 08:38.751
Come on, let's go!

08:42.282 --> 08:44.452
This is all your fault!

08:44.482 --> 08:47.332
How is this my fault? I just wanna play punches.

08:49.402 --> 08:50.622
The chair!

08:51.152 --> 08:52.312
The Rigby!

08:53.972 --> 08:55.122
Oh, dear!

08:55.372 --> 08:56.682
Hello? Hello?

08:56.832 --> 08:58.902
Please someone come quick!

08:58.902 --> 09:01.872
Quartz parchment shears' gone terribly wrong...

09:02.012 --> 09:03.612
Pops, where are you?

09:05.772 --> 09:08.432
Skips, take the shortcut, I'll go around back.

09:14.682 --> 09:15.622
Idiots.

09:27.652 --> 09:29.462
Skips!

09:30.252 --> 09:32.412
What did you do?

09:32.472 --> 09:35.372
They're playing rock peper scissors. Grab on!

09:35.372 --> 09:38.682
Don't you know that's an evil game?

09:38.682 --> 09:39.942
Hold on, everybody.

09:39.942 --> 09:42.322
Hold on, everybody!

09:42.322 --> 09:43.772
Hold on, every... Rigby!

09:54.632 --> 09:57.392
What do we do?

09:57.822 --> 10:00.072
You have to break the tie!

10:00.202 --> 10:03.712
Rigby! We have to in this. I'm gonna throw rock!

10:03.712 --> 10:05.632
- Yeah, right. - I'm not kidding!

10:05.632 --> 10:07.482
Hurry up! Do it now!

10:15.542 --> 10:16.522
Did you win?

10:17.032 --> 10:18.732
I think you win.

10:18.962 --> 10:22.302
It doesn't matter. I wasn't able to hold on that chair anyways.

10:22.412 --> 10:23.482
Look!

10:24.742 --> 10:26.482
Oh, cool!

10:26.482 --> 10:27.492
No, you don't.

10:27.492 --> 10:29.282
You're not getting that chair.

10:29.352 --> 10:30.962
But here's what you do get.

10:31.012 --> 10:33.382
You get to flip that cart back over.

10:33.382 --> 10:37.272
You're throwing that chair away, and then you're cleaning up this whole mess!

10:37.632 --> 10:40.552
Pops, you're coming with me, and you two idiots,

10:40.552 --> 10:43.912
if this isn't cleaned up when I get back, You're fired!

10:44.272 --> 10:46.752
- Geez, I can't believe it... - But... Benson, I...

10:48.512 --> 10:49.292
Okay.

10:49.372 --> 10:53.182
Starting now, let's both promise not to do anything to screw this up.

10:53.202 --> 10:54.792
- Agreed? - Agreed.

10:56.762 --> 10:59.032
Rock paper scissors for who gets to drive the cart?
