01:18.320 --> 01:20.830
There's no place like home.

01:22.991 --> 01:24.658
That's especially true if you spent

01:24.659 --> 01:27.077
twelve hours on a flight
from Central America

01:27.078 --> 01:31.448
that gave new meaning
to the word "turbulence. "

01:33.710 --> 01:35.878
Pete Thornton sent me to find
a piece of evidence

01:35.879 --> 01:38.839
that would link Fernando Marin,
a major drug dealer,

01:38.840 --> 01:43.100
to the flow of cocaine
into the United States.

01:44.721 --> 01:47.221
And I'd found it...

01:47.599 --> 01:49.975
...hidden in the jungle
and guarded by some tribesmen

01:49.976 --> 01:52.566
who were on Marin's payroll.

01:53.646 --> 01:58.086
They weren't too happy
I'd gotten away with it.

02:00.111 --> 02:02.904
Three times in one day I came
as close to getting killed

02:02.905 --> 02:04.781
as I ever have.

02:04.782 --> 02:08.642
It can make you start to think
real hard.

02:10.496 --> 02:13.165
Your first brush with death
could be an accident.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.709
The second could be a coincidence.

02:15.710 --> 02:18.796
The third could be a message.

02:19.505 --> 02:23.385
And I didn't like the sound of it at all.

02:25.720 --> 02:29.222
But at least I was thousands of miles
from that jungle,

02:29.223 --> 02:31.851
safe in my own place.

02:32.018 --> 02:35.138
That made me feel a little better.

03:18.480 --> 03:23.460
Gringo, you have stolen the property
of Fernando Marin.

03:25.612 --> 03:27.363
I haven't stolen anything.

03:27.364 --> 03:29.073
How did you get in here?

03:29.074 --> 03:32.952
You will take me to the place
where the property is hidden.

03:32.953 --> 03:35.581
To the Phoenix Foundation.

03:35.747 --> 03:38.247
Oh, no. No way.

03:38.375 --> 03:40.875
Oh, I think you will.

03:41.336 --> 03:43.836
Okay.

04:03.316 --> 04:05.568
Look, I don't know what happened
to that computer disk.

04:05.569 --> 04:09.071
It could be on its way to Washington
for all I know.

04:09.072 --> 04:10.781
Be careful with the knife, will you?

04:10.782 --> 04:13.618
Surprise!

04:16.913 --> 04:21.918
- Happy Birthday!
- AII right! Okay! Quiet!

04:30.427 --> 04:33.429
Let's see what we have
behind door number one.

04:33.430 --> 04:37.767
It's your old buddy Jack Dalton
in the flesh.

04:42.313 --> 04:44.940
We knew you'd never come
if you thought it was gonna be a party,

04:44.941 --> 04:47.651
so I told Jack when you were getting in
from Central America,

04:47.652 --> 04:52.332
- and he took it from there.
- Wasn't that a hoot?

04:54.325 --> 04:56.952
AII right, everybody,
give the birthday boy room to breathe.

04:56.953 --> 04:58.829
There's plenty to eat and drink
over there,

04:58.830 --> 05:00.998
and the champagne punch
is on that table.

05:00.999 --> 05:02.499
You'II get yours.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.961
I know you don't Iike gifts,
so I just invited a few people

05:05.962 --> 05:09.372
that I thought you might Iike to see.

05:10.008 --> 05:12.508
I don't believe it.

05:15.179 --> 05:18.682
Thanks for coming, Harry.
I know you don't Iike bus rides.

05:18.683 --> 05:20.350
I missed enough
of your birthdays.

05:20.351 --> 05:22.853
Besides, what are grandpas for?

05:22.854 --> 05:25.856
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?
- I'm starving.

05:25.857 --> 05:31.567
We got plenty of time to gab.
I'm bunking over at your place.

05:31.863 --> 05:36.784
- Well, quite a spread, huh?
- Yeah, it's nice.

05:37.618 --> 05:40.746
Did you get what we were after?

05:42.999 --> 05:45.208
Yes, sir.

05:45.209 --> 05:48.212
AII right. Well done.

05:48.379 --> 05:50.922
Oh, there were some people
who couldn't make it,

05:50.923 --> 05:54.051
but they sent you remembrances.

05:54.218 --> 05:56.136
They're on the table
where Jack is standing.

05:56.137 --> 05:58.637
Just put it right here.

06:00.975 --> 06:04.519
Would you meet me
by the crab claws, please?

06:04.520 --> 06:08.064
How could you do this? You broke into
my place and held me at knifepoint.

06:08.065 --> 06:10.567
It was all Pete Thornton's idea.
Pete Thornton made me do it.

06:10.568 --> 06:13.027
Stop it! Your eye's twitching.
You're Iying to me.

06:13.028 --> 06:15.071
Oh, Mac, don't bring me down.

06:15.072 --> 06:17.323
This joke just may be
the pinnacle of my career.

06:17.324 --> 06:19.117
So help me, Jack, someday--

06:19.118 --> 06:21.202
- Someday--
- I know. I know. Bang! Zoom!

06:21.203 --> 06:23.703
Happy birthday, MacGyver.

06:31.296 --> 06:34.416
My birthday's a week from Tuesday.

06:35.008 --> 06:37.719
Oh, Penny Parker, Jack Dalton.

06:37.886 --> 06:40.304
Jack used to be a friend.

06:40.305 --> 06:42.945
Well, it's nice to meet you.

06:45.227 --> 06:47.603
There's more where that came from.

06:47.604 --> 06:50.064
How come you never told me
about this vision of Ioveliness?

06:50.065 --> 06:52.858
- Where did you meet her? Shangri-Ia?
- Bulgaria.

06:52.859 --> 06:55.903
See, we were at the airport in Bulgaria,
only I knew the police

06:55.904 --> 06:58.823
were following us, so I put the jewels
in MacGyver's pocket.

06:58.824 --> 07:03.953
But then the police, well, they caught
us and they handcuffed us together.

07:03.954 --> 07:06.288
Boy, you were really mad.

07:06.289 --> 07:08.499
Grab that chair.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.918
Why don't I get two chairs,
and then we can both sit.

07:10.919 --> 07:14.939
It's not for sitting.
Never mind the chair.

07:21.263 --> 07:23.763
Excuse me.

07:31.356 --> 07:37.756
Hey, that's good! Cheap wall.
We just poke our way right out of here.

07:48.665 --> 07:50.791
It's a baggage conveyor belt.

07:50.792 --> 07:56.082
There's no way I can just poke
through this chicken wire.

07:57.465 --> 07:58.841
Damn!

07:58.842 --> 08:01.761
It was a nice thought, though.

08:09.811 --> 08:14.648
AII right, bend these out. We're gonna
make them into a figure eight.

08:14.649 --> 08:16.650
What are you gonna do
with a figure eight?

08:16.651 --> 08:18.485
You ever been to a rodeo?

08:18.486 --> 08:21.321
Sort of. I was Queen
of the Future Farmers once.

08:21.322 --> 08:23.822
Later. Later.

08:28.287 --> 08:29.955
AII right.

08:29.956 --> 08:32.456
Good.

09:09.620 --> 09:12.831
Now I know why you asked
about the rodeo.

09:12.832 --> 09:15.875
You're gonna Iasso
the conveyor belt.

09:15.876 --> 09:18.379
I sure am gonna try.

09:28.764 --> 09:30.640
Let's go.

09:30.641 --> 09:32.392
What are you doing?

09:32.393 --> 09:34.893
I've gotta have my purse!

09:42.236 --> 09:48.826
- It's just Iike the ride at Disneyland.
- Will you keep your head down?

10:11.848 --> 10:14.348
Economy class.

10:14.476 --> 10:19.980
And you should have seen the Iook
on the faces of all those foreigners.

10:19.981 --> 10:21.774
Stick with me,
my Iittle Bulgarian bundle,

10:21.775 --> 10:24.485
and we'II go first class
all the way to the stars.

10:24.486 --> 10:27.286
Excuse me, kids, I'II be back.

10:28.907 --> 10:31.408
- What's the matter with him?
- Birthday blues.

10:31.409 --> 10:33.661
I've seen it before.
"What's the meaning of Iife?

10:33.662 --> 10:37.442
What's the grand plan?
What's to drink?"

10:38.333 --> 10:41.752
- So tell me, what is it you do?
- I'm an actress.

10:41.753 --> 10:44.588
What an astounding coincidence.
I'm a producer.

10:44.589 --> 10:47.675
Really? I also sing and dance.

10:47.842 --> 10:49.093
No!

10:49.094 --> 10:52.179
When I was a Iad I studied opera
in Italy. In Milan.

10:52.180 --> 10:54.680
I won a La Scala-ship.

10:57.352 --> 10:59.686
Will you Iook at all this Ioot?

10:59.687 --> 11:02.856
Yeah, you know, the funny thing is,
darned near every one of these things

11:02.857 --> 11:05.400
almost got me killed
at one time or another.

11:05.401 --> 11:07.653
They sent me to the Middle East
for this.

11:07.654 --> 11:11.864
Shows all the terrorist targets
in the States.

11:12.867 --> 11:19.587
"For a man who's always on the run.
From your friends at the Department."

14:03.870 --> 14:05.871
Halt!

14:05.872 --> 14:08.372
That is far enough.

14:15.048 --> 14:17.548
The map.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.093
You know, I'd Iike to...

14:20.094 --> 14:23.389
...but I really need it myself.

14:24.807 --> 14:27.307
You amuse me.

14:30.355 --> 14:32.314
Sorry.

14:32.315 --> 14:34.815
But I really do need it.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.813
I guess it just proves
that a good map

16:37.814 --> 16:40.608
will always get you
to where you wanna go.

16:40.609 --> 16:43.861
Yeah, provided you wanna get there
in the first place.

16:43.862 --> 16:47.197
I never quite thought of it that way.

16:47.198 --> 16:49.698
I'm starting to, Harry.

16:50.910 --> 16:53.410
Excuse me.

17:01.171 --> 17:04.548
Hey, many happy returns, pal.
You don't Iook a day over 50.

17:04.549 --> 17:08.176
- Don't ask me how I feel.
- This is hot stuff, MacGyver.

17:08.178 --> 17:10.345
The information you brought
back on this disk

17:10.346 --> 17:11.847
is exactly what we needed.

17:11.848 --> 17:14.016
When I get back to Washington,
the Iegal wheels

17:14.017 --> 17:17.144
against Mr. Fernando Marin
are really gonna start humming.

17:17.145 --> 17:19.730
That'II be one Iess drug connection
we have to worry about.

17:19.731 --> 17:22.451
Well, I'm glad it worked out.

17:23.026 --> 17:24.943
I think I'm gonna buy myself a drink.

17:24.944 --> 17:28.044
- You want anything?
- No, thanks.

17:28.531 --> 17:31.031
- Rough trip?
- Well, yeah.

17:31.034 --> 17:33.535
Came close to dying
about three different times.

17:33.536 --> 17:35.454
Really? What happened?

17:35.455 --> 17:37.955
It doesn't matter now.

17:38.332 --> 17:41.251
What does matter is that
the only reason I'm alive is Iuck.

17:41.252 --> 17:43.503
I had nothing to do with it.

17:43.504 --> 17:45.839
Well, you always said
you'd rather be Iucky than good.

17:45.840 --> 17:48.340
Yeah. Yeah, I said that.

17:49.677 --> 17:52.470
But you know, Pete,
I'm starting to think I pressed my Iuck

17:52.471 --> 17:54.971
about as far as it can go.

17:58.603 --> 18:01.103
Now, what does that mean?

18:01.188 --> 18:03.688
I've had it, Pete.

18:05.651 --> 18:08.151
I wanna resign.

18:20.583 --> 18:24.294
MacGyver, think about
what you're saying.

18:24.295 --> 18:27.130
- Resigning--
- I have thought about it, Pete.

18:27.131 --> 18:30.717
For the past 24 hours
I've done nothing but think about it.

18:30.718 --> 18:32.552
What are you going to do
after you resign?

18:32.553 --> 18:34.804
Have you thought about that?
What are you gonna do?

18:34.805 --> 18:38.850
Sit behind a desk?
You would go crazy inside of a week.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.311
Take it from somebody who knows.

18:41.312 --> 18:43.604
MacGyver, it's your birthday.
I mean, you're--

18:43.605 --> 18:45.648
You're being introspective.
That's normal.

18:45.649 --> 18:48.693
I understand that, but tomorrow
you're gonna wake up,

18:48.694 --> 18:50.820
and everything is gonna seem
different to you.

18:50.821 --> 18:52.822
Pete...

18:52.823 --> 18:54.866
...for the past seven years
I have done nothing

18:54.867 --> 18:59.787
but travel around the world
getting shot up, Iocked up, blown up,

18:59.788 --> 19:03.249
and all I've got to show for it are
a couple of empty rolls of duct tape.

19:03.250 --> 19:07.044
Listen to me. There is no one else
in the world Iike you.

19:07.045 --> 19:10.131
You're a cat. You've got nine Iives.

19:10.132 --> 19:14.885
I've already Iived eight of them.
I don't want to waste the Iast one.

19:14.886 --> 19:17.221
I want to go home to Minnesota.

19:17.222 --> 19:19.640
Wanna find someone,
get married or something.

19:19.641 --> 19:23.451
Do normal things
while I still have time.

19:24.730 --> 19:27.740
So I'd appreciate it if you'd...

19:29.234 --> 19:33.074
...draw up some resignation papers
for me.

19:33.447 --> 19:35.947
PIease.

19:41.204 --> 19:44.039
Redford? Bob? He's a sweetheart.

19:44.040 --> 19:47.877
Prince, I Iove the guy.
Taught him how to ski.

19:47.878 --> 19:51.005
- What's wrong with your eye?
- Oh, I-- AIIergy.

19:51.006 --> 19:52.548
Must be a cat
around here somewhere.

19:52.549 --> 19:56.051
Did I ever tell you about the time
I saved MacGyver from certain death?

19:56.052 --> 19:58.762
Because if I didn't, I should've.
Picture this:

19:58.763 --> 20:01.640
There we are on the rim of Africa.

20:01.641 --> 20:04.435
Among the tents
of the noble nomads.

20:04.436 --> 20:07.396
There must be a cat
around here somewhere.

20:07.397 --> 20:10.023
Anyway, the noble nomads
aren't so noble, on account of

20:10.024 --> 20:13.193
because the head honcho ripped off
this very valuable piece of horseflesh.

20:13.194 --> 20:15.487
MacGyver goes right in there
to get that horse

20:15.488 --> 20:18.768
and return it to its rightful owner.

20:49.689 --> 20:55.349
You know, we could go back
to your place and talk about this.

20:55.403 --> 20:57.903
No, I didn't think so.

22:15.190 --> 22:18.025
But you said that you saved MacGyver
from certain death.

22:18.026 --> 22:22.606
Exactly. Who do you think
was flying that chopper?

22:22.906 --> 22:25.406
I think I'II try this.

22:26.201 --> 22:28.841
You think? I'm gonna try it.

22:31.665 --> 22:36.001
The very next dinner party I give,
"Breast of Iizard à Ia MacGyver."

22:36.002 --> 22:38.502
It's delicious.

22:45.345 --> 22:47.388
You're a very...

22:47.389 --> 22:49.889
...unexpected man, MacGyver.

22:50.809 --> 22:53.185
You...

22:53.186 --> 22:55.686
...keep me off balance.

22:57.065 --> 23:00.235
- I'm sorry.
- No.

23:00.402 --> 23:02.902
I think...

23:04.572 --> 23:07.072
I think I Iike it.

23:28.429 --> 23:30.929
Wanna share?

23:36.521 --> 23:39.021
That's quite an offer.

23:42.777 --> 23:44.903
Is that a yes?

23:44.904 --> 23:47.404
Or no?

24:17.228 --> 24:19.848
Will you excuse me? MacGyver!

24:21.273 --> 24:23.773
Happy birthday!

24:37.164 --> 24:39.707
MacGyver, it is so great to see you.

24:39.708 --> 24:43.836
- Happy birthday!
- Kate, it's good to see you. I--

24:43.837 --> 24:45.463
I don't know what to say.

24:45.464 --> 24:50.426
Oh, isn't it wonderful?
And you're responsible for it too.

24:50.427 --> 24:52.637
What? No way.

24:52.638 --> 24:54.764
I want you to meet my husband,
Mike Desmond.

24:54.765 --> 24:58.811
Mike. Mike, this is MacGyver.

24:59.978 --> 25:02.647
- Mike Husband, great to meet you.
- Desmond.

25:02.648 --> 25:05.233
Mike Desmond. You're the Iinebacker
for the Titans, right?

25:05.234 --> 25:06.859
- Right.
- Oh, you're terrific!

25:06.860 --> 25:09.153
- You're having a great year. Keep it up.
- Thank you.

25:09.154 --> 25:10.530
Kate's told me so much about you.

25:10.531 --> 25:13.241
She said you two had quite a time
when you were in San Sebastian.

25:13.242 --> 25:15.117
No, no, we--

25:15.118 --> 25:16.953
Well, we didn't see too much
of each other.

25:16.954 --> 25:18.746
Actually, it was
one of those things where--

25:18.747 --> 25:24.377
I thought Kate said if it wasn't for you,
she'd have never gotten out of there.

25:24.378 --> 25:27.964
Well, yeah. Her editor sent me
down there to get her out.

25:27.965 --> 25:31.175
After I took those pictures of
the general with his pals from the mob.

25:31.176 --> 25:34.553
I guess he figured he wasn't
too photogenic, huh?

25:34.554 --> 25:36.430
We'd been on the run
for a couple of days

25:36.431 --> 25:39.725
till we reached the border. Home free.

25:39.726 --> 25:41.519
Except we weren't.

25:41.520 --> 25:44.897
The general and his soldiers
were there in force.

25:44.898 --> 25:49.368
So I figured we needed
some kind of a diversion.

25:52.572 --> 25:55.822
It's time to get our party started!

26:48.336 --> 26:50.836
Forward! Up the hill!

27:14.779 --> 27:18.379
- Hang on, Connolly!
- Hang on to what?

27:30.127 --> 27:32.627
Come on, Kate, swim.

27:42.890 --> 27:45.558
Yeah, the pictures were a Iittle wet,
but we got them out.

27:45.559 --> 27:47.685
Kate used those pictures
in her articles,

27:47.686 --> 27:50.813
and the magazine promoted her
to senior editor.

27:50.814 --> 27:52.398
That's how I met Mike.

27:52.399 --> 27:54.817
And now there's a Mike Jr.
on the way.

27:54.818 --> 27:56.653
That's terrific.

27:56.654 --> 27:59.739
- I don't know how you keep doing it.
- What's that?

27:59.740 --> 28:01.658
Bouncing all over the world.

28:01.659 --> 28:05.078
I know I used to think
that was the only way to Iive,

28:05.079 --> 28:08.414
but, well, now that I have a home
and I'm gonna have a family,

28:08.415 --> 28:12.210
well, I just couldn't be happier
in my Iife.

28:12.211 --> 28:14.378
Yeah.

28:14.379 --> 28:18.382
You see how this Iine intersects
that one obliquely?

28:18.383 --> 28:21.385
That means you and I
will be spending a Iot of time together.

28:21.386 --> 28:25.848
Well, that's funny because, see, I had
my palm read by Madame Bourguiba,

28:25.849 --> 28:28.684
not the one on Hollywood Boulevard,
but the one on Melrose,

28:28.685 --> 28:33.105
and she told me that if that Iine
intersects that one obliquely,

28:33.106 --> 28:34.982
then that means
I'm gonna move to India

28:34.983 --> 28:37.993
and Iive in a hut on the Ganges.

28:39.404 --> 28:41.238
Exactly.

28:41.239 --> 28:44.825
But that's after
we spend a Iot of time together.

28:44.826 --> 28:47.161
You see, there's the Ganges,

28:47.162 --> 28:53.882
there's the Iittle hut, and there we are
spending a Iot of time together.

29:41.424 --> 29:44.444
- Waiting for a bus?
- Bannister?

29:45.178 --> 29:47.678
What the heck?

29:49.140 --> 29:51.640
Where'd you come from?

29:58.858 --> 30:01.151
New director of operations
sent me in. Backup.

30:01.152 --> 30:04.237
- New director?
- Oh, you're gonna Iove him.

30:04.238 --> 30:06.738
I can hardly wait.

30:12.038 --> 30:13.914
We're now 90 percent home.

30:13.915 --> 30:19.075
Just down this hill
and a couple of kilometres due west.

30:34.477 --> 30:36.977
Brakes seem to be fading.

30:40.191 --> 30:42.691
Correction, nonexistent!

30:48.866 --> 30:52.577
Yeah, we're going to the border,
all right. In pieces.

30:52.578 --> 30:54.787
Unless this emergency...

30:54.788 --> 30:58.568
Nothing. I think we're out of fluid, Mac.

31:00.002 --> 31:01.878
Sorry, pal.

31:01.879 --> 31:03.212
Some backup, huh?

31:03.213 --> 31:06.049
- No, no. There's gotta be a way.
- What are you talking about?

31:06.050 --> 31:07.800
There's gotta be a way
to stop this thing.

31:07.801 --> 31:10.553
- Without brakes? Oh, yeah.
- With brakes.

31:10.554 --> 31:13.054
Come again?

31:13.307 --> 31:14.849
- Pop the hood.
- What?

31:14.850 --> 31:17.350
Just pop it.

31:26.153 --> 31:27.570
What the hell are you doing?

31:27.571 --> 31:30.323
There's still gotta be some fluid
in the power steering, right?

31:30.324 --> 31:32.700
Maybe I can pump it
into the brake cylinder.

31:32.701 --> 31:35.201
Sure that'II work?

31:35.370 --> 31:37.870
No.

32:31.801 --> 32:34.052
AII right, pump the brake!

32:34.053 --> 32:36.553
Pump the brakes!

32:38.141 --> 32:40.225
Mac, my boy,

32:40.226 --> 32:42.644
I think you did it.

32:42.645 --> 32:45.145
We got brakes!

32:48.651 --> 32:51.151
Piece of cake!

32:55.533 --> 32:58.994
I went in there to save you,
and you wound up saving me.

32:58.995 --> 33:01.747
Oh, I bet I know what you two
are talking about.

33:01.748 --> 33:05.333
- The East German assignment, right?
- How did you guess?

33:05.334 --> 33:10.756
Well, you two guys working together,
you-- You were the best.

33:10.757 --> 33:14.384
I got a Ietter of commendation from
the State Department about that case.

33:14.385 --> 33:17.637
Well, send me a copy
one of these days, Pete.

33:17.638 --> 33:20.138
Maybe I can get a raise.

33:20.558 --> 33:26.938
Speaking of Ietters, Pete, do you have
that Ietter of resignation for me?

33:26.939 --> 33:30.569
- You really serious about that?
- Yeah.

33:33.195 --> 33:35.695
It's on my desk.

33:42.747 --> 33:45.832
Bud tells me you're his best friend.

33:45.833 --> 33:47.625
I Iike to think so.

33:47.626 --> 33:50.795
Then maybe you know
what's eating him.

33:50.796 --> 33:53.296
Yeah, Harry, I do.

33:53.674 --> 33:56.714
I know exactly what's eating him.

34:33.922 --> 34:39.081
- Am I butting in on something?
- No, come on in, Harry.

34:42.431 --> 34:47.726
A real nice party those folks
are throwing for you out there.

34:47.728 --> 34:50.978
So how come you're not enjoying it?

34:52.649 --> 34:54.525
I'm trying to make a decision, Harry.

34:54.525 --> 34:57.110
About the toughest one of my Iife.

34:57.112 --> 34:59.612
Want some free advice?

34:59.781 --> 35:02.032
I'd pay for it.

35:02.033 --> 35:03.993
Go with your gut.

35:03.994 --> 35:07.413
What's up here
can keep you confused.

35:07.414 --> 35:11.626
What's here most of the time
tells it plain.

35:54.669 --> 35:58.714
Hi. Listen, I want you two
to be the first to know.

35:58.715 --> 36:01.215
I hate this.

36:03.594 --> 36:06.346
- What's that for?
- For being a really sweet guy.

36:06.347 --> 36:07.848
And because I have great news.

36:07.849 --> 36:10.517
Mr. Thornton offered me a job
in the research department.

36:10.518 --> 36:12.936
So that means we're all three
gonna be working together:

36:12.937 --> 36:15.063
- You, me and Jack.
- What are you talking about?

36:15.064 --> 36:17.315
Well, you're Jack-Be-Quick
Messenger Service.

36:17.316 --> 36:19.526
You deliver packages
for the Foundation.

36:19.527 --> 36:22.404
- How did you know about that?
- And you weren't flying the chopper

36:22.405 --> 36:25.365
in Arabia that saved MacGyver
from certain death.

36:25.366 --> 36:28.743
- How did you know about that?
- Well, there's a memo on the wall

36:28.744 --> 36:30.662
in the Iadies' Iounge, and it says

36:30.663 --> 36:33.540
that when Jack Dalton's Ieft eye
is twitching,

36:33.541 --> 36:36.181
he's Iying Iike a cheap rug.

36:37.003 --> 36:39.963
"La Scala-ship." That's so cute.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.802
Truth hurts, huh, Jack?

36:45.803 --> 36:49.293
Especially when you're not used to it.

37:03.070 --> 37:06.781
If this is what you really want,
I'm not gonna try to talk you out of it.

37:06.782 --> 37:09.909
- Thank you.
- I respect you too much for that.

37:09.910 --> 37:11.911
I appreciate that.

37:11.912 --> 37:14.747
I was thinking about
the first assignment I ever gave you.

37:14.748 --> 37:17.417
- East Berlin.
- Pete, don't start.

37:17.418 --> 37:19.836
In some ways it hardly seems
that Iong ago.

37:19.837 --> 37:23.464
And then smuggling you out
in that steamer trunk.

37:23.465 --> 37:27.176
It wasn't a steamer trunk.
It was a coffin.

37:27.177 --> 37:28.970
Oh, yeah, that's right.

37:28.971 --> 37:31.431
Yeah, I was hoping that
the information we were Iooking for

37:31.432 --> 37:34.267
was gonna reunite the family
of an East German scientist

37:34.268 --> 37:35.935
who'd defected to the West.

37:35.936 --> 37:38.312
And I was willing
to bet everything I had

37:38.313 --> 37:41.853
that you were the guy to bring it out.

41:09.231 --> 41:11.857
Like to have seen that one myself.

41:11.858 --> 41:14.485
Done a Iot of
good things, MacGyver,

41:14.486 --> 41:17.154
but nothing better than bringing
that family together.

41:17.155 --> 41:19.406
Well...

41:19.407 --> 41:21.917
...here's to your new Iife.

41:22.494 --> 41:27.464
But I'm sure gonna miss
sharing the old one with you.

41:32.087 --> 41:36.967
Attention, everybody!
Gather round! It's cake time!

41:38.259 --> 41:41.513
Happy birthday to you

41:41.680 --> 41:44.933
Happy birthday to you

41:45.100 --> 41:49.687
Happy birthday
Dear MacGyver

41:49.854 --> 41:54.901
Happy birthday to you

42:02.200 --> 42:04.700
You want big piece?

42:05.995 --> 42:08.121
Come on, Mac, birthday boy,
how about a speech?

42:08.122 --> 42:10.374
- Speech.
- Come on.

42:10.375 --> 42:13.877
- Jack, don't do this to me.
- Oh, come on, Iike in the old days.

42:13.878 --> 42:16.254
I never gave speeches
in the old days.

42:16.255 --> 42:18.841
Oh, that's right. I did.

42:19.008 --> 42:23.512
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd just Iike
to say a few words in honour--

42:23.513 --> 42:26.056
Okay, ducky,
they're all warmed up for you.

42:26.057 --> 42:28.557
Thanks.

42:30.269 --> 42:34.898
When I was a kid, my grandfather
used to say to me

42:34.899 --> 42:37.859
that a fella's Iife wasn't
worth mentioning

42:37.860 --> 42:41.154
if he hadn't shared it
with some folks along the way.

42:41.155 --> 42:47.535
- That is what you said, isn't it, Harry?
- Yeah, only I said it shorter.

42:47.536 --> 42:50.036
Yeah.

42:50.706 --> 42:54.646
Well, I--
I guess it's taken this party...

42:55.002 --> 42:56.378
...to make me realize

42:56.379 --> 43:00.465
that about the only thing
worth mentioning about my Iife...

43:00.466 --> 43:05.428
...is the fact that you've all
shared your Iives with me.

43:05.429 --> 43:07.806
And that I'd never have known
any of you

43:07.807 --> 43:13.357
if I hadn't been doing
the kinds of things I've been doing.

43:16.941 --> 43:23.761
And I just want you all to know
that you're all very, very special to me.

43:25.699 --> 43:28.529
Well, this is a birthday party.

43:28.577 --> 43:31.077
Let them eat cake.

43:38.462 --> 43:39.962
Pete.

43:39.963 --> 43:42.553
Can I see that Ietter again?

43:44.176 --> 43:46.803
What's the matter?
You forget to sign it?

43:46.804 --> 43:49.431
No, I-- I signed it.

44:21.254 --> 44:24.244
"Happy Iandings and all the best.

44:24.549 --> 44:28.929
Captain Jim Taylor, 16th Airborne."

44:34.309 --> 44:37.937
When Jim Taylor's plane went down
over the Central Asian highlands,

44:37.938 --> 44:41.688
I was sent in
as a rescue party of one.

44:43.526 --> 44:45.569
Hanging there on the face
of a rock formation,

44:45.570 --> 44:51.020
I started to realize how insecure
my grip on life could be.

44:51.159 --> 44:53.744
When you're a few thousand feet
straight up,

44:53.745 --> 45:00.205
there's always the chance of falling
a few thousand feet straight down.

45:20.396 --> 45:23.273
Our information told us
that Jim was being held in a camp

45:23.274 --> 45:26.314
right near the site of the crash.

45:27.904 --> 45:29.738
We knew the longer he stayed
a prisoner,

45:29.739 --> 45:33.599
the weaker his grip on life
was gonna be.

45:33.701 --> 45:38.038
I wanted to just walk up to that cage
and break him out,

45:38.039 --> 45:42.299
but the local activity
made me change my mind.

45:42.543 --> 45:45.043
And my clothes.

45:47.924 --> 45:52.184
Luckily, I found someone
who was just my size.

46:09.737 --> 46:12.237
God, I hate heights.

46:26.795 --> 46:31.245
- What are you doing?
- Making a rocket thruster.

46:36.513 --> 46:39.013
What are we doing?!

46:39.266 --> 46:41.766
I'II tell you Iater.

46:57.951 --> 46:59.827
Yeah, Captain Taylor said

46:59.828 --> 47:02.496
that was about the craziest thing
he'd ever seen.

47:02.497 --> 47:05.334
Well, he was right. Was.

47:05.500 --> 47:09.212
Pete, about that Ietter of resignation.

47:09.755 --> 47:11.839
Yeah?

47:11.840 --> 47:14.509
Got any Scotch tape?

47:16.845 --> 47:19.345
Kidding.
