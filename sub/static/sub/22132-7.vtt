yeah

11:21.649 --> 11:24.649
yeah

11:28.139 --> 11:32.039
you seem to think that making a rescue
is all that this is about

11:32.940 --> 11:36.270
you're an individual and I need you to
be a part of a team

11:36.269 --> 11:39.419
Sean I don't see what you're so upset
about what happened yesterday I mean I

11:39.419 --> 11:40.379
made the rescue

11:40.379 --> 11:44.490
you want me to get the guy i got the guy
there's more to it than that Jason a lot

11:44.490 --> 11:52.769
more to spend some time here together at
sandy beach at the end of the shift

11:52.769 --> 11:56.579
I'm going to tell you whether you stay
on this team or bump right there

11:56.580 --> 12:01.290
don't finish that I don't want to hear
what falls or because there is no or

12:01.289 --> 12:03.839
Sean I have to be on this team

12:03.840 --> 12:06.990
I can't go back to Texas it's either
here or nowhere

12:08.100 --> 12:11.519
look today I'll make the greatest thing
you've ever seen I'll make three or four

12:11.519 --> 12:15.929
another life guards home after this
entire Beach you think that making a

12:15.929 --> 12:18.089
spectacular rescue will keep you here

12:18.090 --> 12:22.920
it won't know it won't - what the hell
do you want from me Sean

12:22.919 --> 12:27.569
I've done everything you asked me to do
a job up cliff swim for miles under the

12:27.570 --> 12:29.129
water on top of the water

12:29.129 --> 12:32.850
learn the jet pickups I want you to
change the way you think

12:33.600 --> 12:36.600
how I think that's what this is about

12:37.889 --> 12:40.859
this is about Sean I don't even
understand what think he has to do with

12:40.859 --> 12:41.369
it

12:41.369 --> 12:45.149
I don't think when I'm in the water I
react feeling see that victim i'm gonna

12:45.149 --> 12:45.899
go get him

12:45.899 --> 12:49.379
we feel the ribs feel occurrence in the
water

12:49.379 --> 12:53.129
you don't think it what's the job Jason

12:53.720 --> 12:59.060
a lifeguard what's the lifeguard on Sean
what's a lifeguard person who saves

12:59.059 --> 12:59.599
lives

12:59.600 --> 13:01.159
wrong answer

13:01.159 --> 13:05.539
book to understand something you have to
break down in its simplest form now

13:05.539 --> 13:07.669
what's the lifeguard break it down

13:07.669 --> 13:10.849
someone who guards lives right

13:10.850 --> 13:15.319
you guard lives you go into the water to
save a victim as the last resort

13:15.318 --> 13:18.318
I call it risk management

13:20.360 --> 13:24.500
yeah

13:27.009 --> 13:33.189
free to give a speech sandy great place
to be bored body surf by one of the best

13:33.190 --> 13:33.760
boy

13:33.759 --> 13:36.610
but if you come on prepared are unaware
it can be one of the most dangerous

13:36.610 --> 13:38.110
beaches in why

13:38.110 --> 13:40.490
that's true look out there

13:40.490 --> 13:42.560
what do you see

13:42.559 --> 13:45.709
beach water waves people all right

13:45.710 --> 13:50.690
the water the way is there the hazards
it has its together with people you have

13:50.690 --> 13:55.310
risked your job is risk management so i
don't fall

13:56.090 --> 14:00.170
ok ok can you eliminate the hazards the
water

14:00.169 --> 14:05.028
no can you eliminate the people you want
to clear the beach but you can your jobs

14:05.028 --> 14:08.000
done without people this beach is one
hundred percent safe

14:08.000 --> 14:14.149
not gonna happen right so your job is to
manage those two items to allow them to

14:14.149 --> 14:16.879
come together as safely as possible

14:16.879 --> 14:20.689
you can learn that today then you can
stand the team

and that right Nick pretty much

18:20.410 --> 18:23.980
everything in their training way back to
the selection process

18:24.819 --> 18:30.250
it's not just about strength or speed
also about having an indomitable will

18:31.180 --> 18:36.160
fascinating isn't it Ali to know that
you've been selected for that trait

18:36.909 --> 18:40.599
must be difficult about to fear failure

18:42.038 --> 18:46.329
not so for probably just haven't come up
against right challenge

18:46.329 --> 18:49.329
very well could be coming up on the
pipeline

19:00.500 --> 19:03.559
there is there's a really creates a
Banzai Pipeline

19:04.339 --> 19:08.119
you know what makes us so special is its
almost vertical the waves in the winter

19:08.119 --> 19:09.289
storm said it

19:09.289 --> 19:12.319
the would say five min hi

19:12.890 --> 19:18.530

different schools

19:32.720 --> 19:35.960
first it's a beautiful Elizabeth New
Jersey

19:35.960 --> 19:39.350
