00:14.057 --> 00:15.537
Aw, I love
our cozy date nights.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.626
Me, too, baby.

00:17.669 --> 00:19.454
Grape me.

00:21.673 --> 00:24.589
Oh, man, I hate
y'all cozy date nights.

00:24.633 --> 00:27.114
That's because you're not
a romantic like your father.

00:27.157 --> 00:29.725
Now be quiet, we're trying
to watch Swamp Truckers.

00:30.813 --> 00:32.510
Man, you got
to love that Jolene.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.556
That girl's got
more tires than teeth.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.038
Well, I will see y'all later.

00:38.081 --> 00:40.431
Sofia and I are going
for a walk on the beach.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.738
The beach?

00:42.781 --> 00:45.784
Ain't nothing romantic about
getting sand in your cracks.

00:47.308 --> 00:50.615
Grape me again, baby.
But put some finger on it.

00:54.271 --> 00:57.318
Man, please don't put them
grapes back in the fridge.

00:59.276 --> 01:00.756
Oh, man, look.

01:00.799 --> 01:03.063
There's another one of those
Motor Boys commercials.

01:03.106 --> 01:05.587
♪ Car or truck, you're in luck

01:05.630 --> 01:08.068

I don't know, baby.
Should we be scared?

01:13.508 --> 01:14.639
Hell no.

01:14.683 --> 01:17.381
Calvin's Pit Stop
is a local institution.

01:17.425 --> 01:19.644
If anybody should be scared,
it's them.

01:19.688 --> 01:21.342
Change the channel, baby.

01:21.385 --> 01:23.518

01:30.742 --> 01:32.004
They even scared of me

Okay, this one needs
to be washed in cold water,

01:43.625 --> 01:45.714
this one on delicate

01:45.757 --> 01:47.716
and this one is hand-wash only.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.719
Got it.All right.

01:52.199 --> 01:56.159
Uh, Mom-- are you,
are you gonna remember?

01:56.203 --> 01:58.205
That I do your laundry
for free? Yes.

01:59.597 --> 02:02.165
Tina, everyone was right.

02:02.209 --> 02:04.602
You're married to a genius.

02:04.646 --> 02:07.736
Oh, really? Does that guy know
you're also married to Dad?

02:09.216 --> 02:10.869
Very funny.

02:10.913 --> 02:14.003
Look, I figured out the perfect
way to take down Motor Boys.

02:14.046 --> 02:16.223
We're gonna do a commercial
for the shop.

02:16.266 --> 02:18.703
A commercial?
Aren't those expensive?

02:18.747 --> 02:20.792
No, no. I made
a deal on airtime.

02:20.836 --> 02:23.839
The only catch
is we have no budget,

02:23.882 --> 02:25.928
Oh...it has to be done in three days

02:25.971 --> 02:27.669
and we got to
shoot it ourselves.

02:29.540 --> 02:32.195
Told you. Genius.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.328
Mom is right.
We can't do a commercial.

02:34.371 --> 02:36.460
No, trust me, I got
it all figured out.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.636
You're gonna shoot it
with your fancy new phone,

02:38.680 --> 02:40.116
we'll play ourselves

02:40.160 --> 02:42.553
and I just got someone
to play the customer.

02:42.597 --> 02:45.077
Dad, what actor would be
desperate enough

02:45.121 --> 02:47.602
to star in the world's
cheapest commercial for free?

02:51.997 --> 02:53.956
I got your text.

02:55.305 --> 02:57.829
I'm ready for my close-up.

03:03.922 --> 03:05.141
Ah, I should go.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.752
I got an early shift
in the morning.

03:07.796 --> 03:10.364
Are you sure you don't want
to stay at my place again?

03:10.407 --> 03:12.192
Uh, you know, I better not.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.715
Last time we didn't
get any sleep,

03:13.758 --> 03:15.847
and I dozed off on my Taser.

03:15.891 --> 03:19.242
Okay. Good night.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.073
Good night.

03:26.858 --> 03:27.772
That went well.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.121
Hey! Man...

03:31.472 --> 03:33.822
Gemma, were you spying on us?

03:33.865 --> 03:35.780
Well, what can I say?

03:35.824 --> 03:38.783
You're my favorite neighbor,
she's my favorite employee.

03:38.827 --> 03:41.612
It makes me happy
to see you two so in l...

03:41.656 --> 03:45.007
L-Los Angeles.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.791
Come on.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.880
Don't tell me you haven't said
"I love you" yet.

03:48.924 --> 03:51.274
What? I-It's only been
four months.

03:51.318 --> 03:53.885
Only? Dave said it
the first time we met.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.887
I was working at the Burger King
drive-through,

03:55.931 --> 03:58.673
and he blurted it out right
after I handed him his Whopper.

04:00.152 --> 04:03.155
I felt like the Burger Queen.

04:04.983 --> 04:07.247
Well, I'm not like
you guys, Gemma.

04:07.290 --> 04:10.380
I don't hand out "I love yous"
like Whoppers.

04:10.424 --> 04:14.819
No-- Well, you're missing out,
because they are both delicious.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.171
Okay, here's how it's gonna go.

04:19.215 --> 04:21.217
I'm gonna say
my line to camera.

04:21.261 --> 04:25.395
"I'm great, Motor Boys suck,
yada yada yada."

04:25.439 --> 04:27.092
Uh, Dad,

04:27.136 --> 04:28.964
I-I'm not sure you can
legally say that.

04:29.007 --> 04:31.749
Hey. Do you want
to keep your job?

04:31.793 --> 04:35.840
Uh, no, not really.
You're forcing me to do this.

04:36.885 --> 04:38.843
Then act like it.

04:40.628 --> 04:43.152
All right,
then Tina says her line.

04:43.195 --> 04:46.764
"Line"? Why do I
only get one line?

04:46.808 --> 04:48.549
Babe, it's a 30-second
commercial.

04:48.592 --> 04:50.551
We got to have time
for the customer.

04:50.594 --> 04:53.336
Eh, if you say so, but, baby,
we need this thing to pop.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.339
And we know
that this is popping.

04:59.864 --> 05:01.866
Okay.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.346
Dave, you ready to go?

05:03.390 --> 05:04.652
Yeah, yeah. Uh...

05:04.695 --> 05:07.872
Uh, about the customer.
Who is this guy?

05:10.092 --> 05:12.050
W-What do you mean?
He's a customer.

05:12.094 --> 05:14.792
Well, yeah, no-- I-I know that,
but if I'm gonna be convincing,

05:14.836 --> 05:16.533
I need to know his backstory.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.100
You know?
What-what makes him tick?

05:18.143 --> 05:20.537
What brought him here and why?

05:20.581 --> 05:25.455
His broken car,
because it's broken.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.849
His broken car.
Okay, let me chew on that.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.898
Okay. Marty,
how we doing over here?

05:33.942 --> 05:36.031
Uh, great. But before we start,

05:36.074 --> 05:37.946
how do we want
this thing to look?

05:37.989 --> 05:39.164
What do you mean?

05:39.208 --> 05:40.470
Well, Motor Boys ads
may be professional,

05:40.514 --> 05:41.732
but they're kind of generic.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.038
So we can stand out

05:43.081 --> 05:46.171
by giving our ad
a distinct visual aesthetic.

05:46.215 --> 05:48.435
An aesthetic?

05:48.478 --> 05:50.698
Why do we need a fake leg?

05:55.442 --> 05:57.922
Okay, nobody treats
Tarantino this way.

05:59.794 --> 06:02.666
Okay. I made a few changes
to your lines

06:02.710 --> 06:04.581
that I think will
make them better.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.148
What did you do?

06:06.191 --> 06:07.889
I gave them to me.

06:07.932 --> 06:10.935
You gave yourself everything
except "I'm Calvin Butler."

06:10.979 --> 06:14.069
Well, I can't say that.
I would sound ridiculous.

06:15.636 --> 06:18.856
Calvin, I have a few questions
about my character.

06:18.900 --> 06:22.382
Dave, since when
do you wear glasses?

06:22.425 --> 06:24.514
Well, that's one
of my questions.

06:26.951 --> 06:30.694
These olives are delicious.
You have to try one.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.696
Mmm.

06:32.740 --> 06:35.133
You know, when my parents
do that, it is gross.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.137
But when you do it, it's hot.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.620
So, uh, there's something

06:43.664 --> 06:45.622
I kind of need
to talk to you about.

06:45.666 --> 06:48.320
Okay, Gemma was
watching us make out.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.455
But she promised
to see a therapist.

06:54.326 --> 06:57.068
It's not that.
I got some news today.

06:58.156 --> 06:59.941
I was offered
a new teaching position.

06:59.984 --> 07:01.595
Wow, that's so great.

07:01.638 --> 07:02.857
It's in Paris.

07:02.900 --> 07:06.034
Wow, that is so in France.

07:06.077 --> 07:09.385
I know. It's this
amazing school.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.213
I applied for it last year,
and I honestly

07:11.256 --> 07:12.519
never thought I would get it.

07:12.562 --> 07:15.435
So I guess you're, um,

07:15.478 --> 07:17.045
moving to France?

07:17.088 --> 07:20.222
I don't know.
I haven't accepted it yet.

07:20.265 --> 07:22.572
Why not?

07:22.616 --> 07:26.968
Because I feel like
what we have is special,

07:27.011 --> 07:30.406
so before I decide...

07:32.277 --> 07:35.455
...I'd like to know
where you think we're going.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.979
Oh. Uh, I, um...

07:39.284 --> 07:41.156
Well...So, do we know what we want?

07:41.199 --> 07:43.245
Hey, can you chill out,
man? This ain't got
nothing to do with you!

07:48.772 --> 07:52.515
Okay, everybody,
if you would all just focus

07:52.559 --> 07:54.778
and stick to my original plan,

07:54.822 --> 07:57.477
we only have to do this
one more time.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.043
Uh, actually, Dad,

07:59.087 --> 08:00.784
I think I might need a few more
takes to capture

08:00.828 --> 08:04.005
the edgy Spike Lee feel
I'm going for.

08:04.048 --> 08:06.442
You're lucky there's not
an aesthetic here,

08:06.486 --> 08:08.488
or I would hit you
over the head with it.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.363
Action!

08:14.406 --> 08:17.192
Hi, I'm Calvin Butler.

08:17.235 --> 08:21.152
And here at Calvin's Pit Stop,
our customers are friends,

08:21.196 --> 08:23.241
and our friends are family.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.374
Just ask my wife Tina.

08:25.417 --> 08:28.420
Do you have a problem
with your car?

08:30.205 --> 08:32.381
Talk to Tina.

08:32.424 --> 08:36.211
Do you want
the best prices in town?

08:36.254 --> 08:37.560
Talk to Tina.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.780
Do you want
the best customer service?

08:39.823 --> 08:41.782
Talk to Calvin.

08:41.825 --> 08:44.611
Or to Tina.

08:49.964 --> 08:53.228
And speaking of customers,
here comes one now.

08:55.796 --> 08:59.495
After the accident, I didn't
know where to bring my car.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.671
But then I found
Calvin's Pit Stop,

09:01.715 --> 09:05.893
where they did a great job
at a fair price.

09:05.936 --> 09:08.199
That's right,
because here at Calvin's...

09:08.243 --> 09:11.768
Sure, I lost my family
in that accident,

09:11.812 --> 09:15.119
but I found a new one
here at Calvin's...

09:15.163 --> 09:17.774
Pit Stop!

09:17.818 --> 09:19.036
Cut!

09:19.080 --> 09:21.038
We're doing it again.

09:21.082 --> 09:23.084
What?

09:23.127 --> 09:25.303
Uh, that's good, because
I forgot to press record.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.618
Oh, my God.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.098
Did you see the cut
of the commercial?

09:37.141 --> 09:39.230
I just watched it.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.232
I was amazing!

09:41.276 --> 09:42.886
I know.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.105
Wasn't I great?

09:44.148 --> 09:47.456
I know it's just
a local commercial,

09:47.499 --> 09:50.111
but I feel like I could
get nominated for something.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.114
Oh, Calvin,

09:53.157 --> 09:54.637
did you see the
commercial yet?

09:54.681 --> 09:56.247
Yeah.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.119
Well, what'd you think?

09:58.162 --> 10:02.863
Well, to put it gently, it was
a flaming pile of hot garbage.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.082
What?

10:05.126 --> 10:07.345
All three of you
were ridiculous.

10:07.389 --> 10:09.521
Marty with his
black-and-white montage

10:09.565 --> 10:14.135
and-and you
just making love to the camera.

10:14.178 --> 10:17.181
And you, with your backstory
about being a drug addict?

10:17.225 --> 10:19.575
Ex-drug addict.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.926
Well, y'all seem
to have forgotten

10:22.970 --> 10:25.102
that my business
is on the line here.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.974
Motor Boys is stealing
my customers,

10:27.017 --> 10:29.629
and y'all up in here
trying to win a BET Award.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.502
Can a white guy win that?
'Cause that would be amazing.

10:35.809 --> 10:38.159
Calvin, we were all
just doing our best.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.335
Well, it's totally unusable.

10:40.378 --> 10:43.207
And now I gotta do it again.
By myself.

10:43.251 --> 10:44.600
How could you do that?
I spent hours

10:44.644 --> 10:46.167
getting into that
character's head.

10:46.210 --> 10:49.213
And let me tell you something,
it was not a pretty place!

10:49.257 --> 10:50.693
Yeah, I got that
when you made me

10:50.737 --> 10:52.956
flush your Tic Tacs
down the toilet.

10:55.350 --> 10:58.179
Well, good luck pulling this off
all by yourself.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.789
I don't have another choice.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.270
I gotta turn something
in by tomorrow,

11:02.313 --> 11:05.229
and it sure as hell can't be
what y'all did.

11:06.230 --> 11:09.320
Can you believe that?I know.

11:09.364 --> 11:12.454
I had the shakes all night
coming off those fake drugs.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.852
Oh, my God, Malcolm.

11:18.895 --> 11:20.767
Sofia told me about
her job offer.

11:20.810 --> 11:23.465
Yeah, I know.
I don't know what to do.

11:23.508 --> 11:26.207
Well, I am her boss.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.122
One phone call to Paris,

11:28.165 --> 11:30.254
and I can make this
whole thing go away.

11:32.517 --> 11:33.605
You're kidding, right?

11:33.649 --> 11:36.130
Of course I'm kidding.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.175
Unless you don't
want me to be.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.613
Well, I appreciate
the offer, Gemma,

11:41.657 --> 11:43.267
but this is her decision.

11:43.311 --> 11:46.227
So, what, you're just
gonna give up?

11:46.270 --> 11:47.794
What else am I
supposed to do?

11:47.837 --> 11:49.186
You're supposed to
fight for her.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.014
You can't just sit back
and do nothing

11:51.058 --> 11:52.015
while the woman you...

11:52.059 --> 11:54.061
Love is going to France?

11:56.280 --> 11:58.021
Oh, my God, you just
said you love her.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.893
No, I didn't.Oh, yeah, you totally did.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.633
No. Are you sure
I didn't say "Louvre"?

12:01.677 --> 12:04.332
Because that's in France, too.

12:04.375 --> 12:07.117
Malcolm, why can't you just
admit that you're in love?

12:07.161 --> 12:10.642
Because I don't want to mess up
her life, Gemma.

12:10.686 --> 12:12.383
Mess up her life how?

12:12.427 --> 12:13.645
Look, think about it.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.343
What if I tell Sofia
I love her,

12:15.386 --> 12:17.214
she decides not to
go to France,

12:17.258 --> 12:19.390
and then it doesn't
work out between us?

12:19.434 --> 12:21.915
I would have stood in the way
of her chasing her dreams.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.395
I would never forgive
myself for that.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.571
I get that.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.922
But what if you do tell her,
and she stays,

12:28.965 --> 12:32.142
and it's the best thing
to ever happen to you two?

12:32.186 --> 12:34.797
I don't know.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.233
Well, I do.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.627
If she goes, you're gonna
spend the rest of your life

12:38.670 --> 12:40.411
wondering "what if?"

12:40.455 --> 12:44.676
And trust me, that is
no way to live.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.157
You know what,
you're right.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.769
You're right. I'm gonna
tell her I love her.

12:49.812 --> 12:52.380
I'm gonna text her right now.

12:52.423 --> 12:55.078
No, no! Malcolm, Malcolm...

12:55.122 --> 12:57.820
You can't just text
something like that.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.822
You gotta make is special.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.563
Like how I gave Dave
a paper crown,

13:01.606 --> 13:03.304
even though it wasn't
his birthday.

13:03.347 --> 13:07.090
Okay, well, what do you
think I should do?

13:07.134 --> 13:08.613
Don't worry, leave it to me.

13:08.657 --> 13:11.181
Thank you, Gemma.
Wait a minute.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.096
You're not calling Paris,
are you?

13:13.140 --> 13:15.490
No, silly.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.492
Unless you want me to.

13:19.973 --> 13:22.540
Okay, Grover, all you have to do
is point the camera at me,

13:22.584 --> 13:24.194
and push the red button.

13:24.238 --> 13:26.936
I know how to use a phone,
Mr. Calvin.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.330
What do you think I am, six?

13:31.419 --> 13:33.377
You got a lot of attitude
for somebody

13:33.421 --> 13:35.336
who can be replaced by a tripod.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.688
Okay, you ready?

13:39.731 --> 13:42.125
Action.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.954
Hi, I'm Calvin Butler,

13:44.998 --> 13:48.523
and here at Calvin's Pit Stop,
I guarantee you

13:48.566 --> 13:51.395
the best repairs with
the lowest prices in town.

13:51.439 --> 13:55.835
Just ask my wife. Right, Tina?

13:55.878 --> 14:00.752
You can't see her,
but she agrees.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.319
What's that, sir?

14:02.363 --> 14:04.974
The best customer service
you've ever had?

14:05.018 --> 14:07.020
Thank you.

14:08.760 --> 14:12.329
Well, you heard them.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.505
So come on down
to Calvin's Pit Stop,

14:14.549 --> 14:19.075
where our customers are friends,
and our friends are family.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.381
Yeah!

14:20.424 --> 14:24.211
Yes. That's how you do it.
What do you think?

14:24.254 --> 14:26.604
It was great, Mr. Calvin.
Really funny.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.345
What do you mean funny?

14:28.389 --> 14:30.478
I mean how you talk about
your friends and family

14:30.521 --> 14:31.958
when you're all by yourself.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.267
Well, I wouldn't be
if my friends and family

14:37.311 --> 14:38.486
took this seriously.

14:38.529 --> 14:40.662
My dad took it seriously.

14:40.705 --> 14:43.970
He said the pressure is what got
his character hooked on drugs.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.409
I know. He told me
he crashed his car

14:48.452 --> 14:50.454
escaping from rehab.

14:53.327 --> 14:55.155
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Calvin.

14:55.198 --> 14:58.027
I guess he was just worried
about letting you down.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.073
He was?

15:00.116 --> 15:02.466
Yeah. He said he really just
wanted to help you

15:02.510 --> 15:04.164
beat Motor Boys.

15:04.207 --> 15:06.949
Oh, man.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.821
Maybe I did overreact.

15:09.865 --> 15:12.607
I guess everybody was
just trying to help.

15:12.650 --> 15:15.392
Not me.
You promised me 20 bucks.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.616
Okay, it's all set.

15:21.659 --> 15:23.748
I've got the balloons,
a bouquet of roses,

15:23.792 --> 15:25.054
and the fourth grade
a capella group

15:25.098 --> 15:27.056
is hiding in the nurse's office.Okay.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.492
Why fourth grade?

15:28.536 --> 15:30.451
Because the sixth graders
just hit puberty,

15:30.494 --> 15:34.455
and they sound like a bunch
of horny sea lions.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.500
Man, I am nervous.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.241
It's gonna be fine.

15:38.285 --> 15:41.505
And if not, I've got
France on speed dial.

15:43.116 --> 15:44.987
Hey, Gemma,
you wanted to see me?

15:45.031 --> 15:47.381
Malcolm?
What are you doing here?

15:47.424 --> 15:50.558
I thought that I would come by
and, uh, surprise you.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.212
Oh, gotta go.

15:52.255 --> 15:54.823
Mrs. Murphy got bit
by the class turtle again.

15:54.866 --> 15:57.043
It is hard to go back to lettuce
when you've tasted blood.

16:00.089 --> 16:02.178
So, what's going on?

16:02.222 --> 16:04.702
Well, I, um...
I've been thinking a lot

16:04.746 --> 16:08.054
about the idea of
you moving to France.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.403
And there's
something that I...

16:09.446 --> 16:10.926
I'm not going.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.755
What? Really?

16:13.798 --> 16:15.148
Really.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.411
What made you
decide to stay?

16:17.454 --> 16:22.155
Well, the more I thought
about going,

16:22.198 --> 16:25.810
the more I realized I don't
want to mess up my life.

16:25.854 --> 16:28.596
Mess up your life?

16:28.639 --> 16:33.079
Yeah. I mean,
I know going to Paris

16:33.122 --> 16:35.516
is something I've always
dreamed of,

16:35.559 --> 16:38.562
but I'm just afraid that

16:38.606 --> 16:41.217
if I give up
everything here to go,

16:41.261 --> 16:43.524
and then it doesn't work out,

16:43.567 --> 16:45.526
I'd never forgive myself.

16:49.747 --> 16:52.707
You know, I know
exactly how you feel.

16:54.187 --> 16:56.058
Which is why you have to go.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.019
What?

17:00.062 --> 17:03.109
Look, Sofia, nothing
would make me happier

17:03.152 --> 17:04.675
than if you stayed.

17:04.719 --> 17:07.939
But you can't let
being afraid stop you

17:07.983 --> 17:09.941
from going after
something that you want.

17:09.985 --> 17:13.423
'Cause if you do,
you'll always be wondering

17:13.467 --> 17:15.817
"what if?" And...

17:15.860 --> 17:18.689
that's no way to live.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.257
I'm gonna miss you.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.348
Yeah, no, I, uh...

17:25.392 --> 17:27.350
I miss you already.

17:29.526 --> 17:31.528
♪ You are my

17:31.572 --> 17:34.662
♪ Sunshine Oh, damn!

17:34.705 --> 17:37.752
♪ My only sunshine

17:37.795 --> 17:42.191
♪ You make me happy.

17:43.714 --> 17:46.630
This isn't Mr. Cullen's
retirement party.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.371
Everybody out.
Out, out, out, out!

17:59.600 --> 18:00.905
I don't know
what Dad's talking about.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.385
My camerawork is great.

18:02.429 --> 18:04.126
I mean sure,
the slow motion didn't work,

18:04.170 --> 18:05.954
but that was only
in the flashbacks.

18:07.651 --> 18:09.958
And there was nothing
wrong with my acting.

18:10.001 --> 18:11.655
Although...

18:11.699 --> 18:14.049
falling out of the wheelchair
might have been a bit much.

18:16.617 --> 18:18.184
Yeah, in hindsight,

18:18.227 --> 18:20.925
maybe I shouldn't have
licked that wrench.

18:22.797 --> 18:24.015
Oh. Hey, everybody.

18:24.059 --> 18:25.887
Hey.Hey.
Hey.

18:25.930 --> 18:30.239
Look, uh, I just wanted to tell
you I'm sorry for what I said.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.632
You were all just

18:31.675 --> 18:35.157
trying to help, and I just kept
shutting you down.

18:35.201 --> 18:38.595
Well, baby, you, uh,
you weren't wrong.

18:38.639 --> 18:43.122
Yeah, we just watched it again,
and we were pretty awful.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.124
Yeah, you were straight trash.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.301
Uh, but the point is,

18:48.344 --> 18:50.433
is you're my family
and you're my friend

18:50.477 --> 18:53.132
and that's what the shop
is all about,

18:53.175 --> 18:57.440
so I was thinking maybe we all
take another crack at it.

18:57.484 --> 18:58.659
You sure? Because we...

18:58.702 --> 19:01.314
I'm in.

19:01.357 --> 19:02.924
Well, me, too.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.926
Oh, what the hell?
Let's make a sequel.

19:04.969 --> 19:08.451
All right. Come on, well,
let's do this thing.

19:08.495 --> 19:11.280
But this time,
no sad backstories.

19:11.324 --> 19:14.370
Totally agree.
But what about, uh,

19:14.414 --> 19:16.416
this time I'm a guy from Boston

19:16.459 --> 19:21.421
who, uh, crashed his car
after he robbed a bank.

19:21.464 --> 19:24.424
Where the hell is an aesthetic
when you need one?

19:31.779 --> 19:33.737
Hi, I'm Calvin Butler.

19:33.781 --> 19:37.001
And here at Calvin's Pit Stop,
we guarantee the best repairs

19:37.045 --> 19:39.395
at the lowest prices in town.

19:39.439 --> 19:41.658
Just ask my wife Tina.

19:41.702 --> 19:44.226
He's right.
And I don't say that often.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.536
But don't take
our word for it.

19:49.579 --> 19:52.365
Here comes
a satisfied customer now.

19:55.846 --> 19:58.458
Wow, these are
the best repairs

19:58.501 --> 20:01.852
and the lowest
prices in town.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.854
Told you.

20:03.898 --> 20:06.422
Thanks, Calvin's Pit Stop.

20:08.511 --> 20:11.035
So come on down
to Calvin's Pit Stop,

20:11.079 --> 20:13.647
where our customers
are friends...

20:13.690 --> 20:16.954
ALL:
And our friends are family.

20:23.222 --> 20:27.095
We did it. We were on TV!

20:27.138 --> 20:29.445
And in the best time slot
of the night.

20:29.489 --> 20:32.970
Right between Swamp Truckers
and Swamp Wives.

20:33.014 --> 20:35.582
Well, I say we celebrate.

20:35.625 --> 20:36.844
Let's go to Ernie's.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.933
Yeah. Let's do it.Okay.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.506
Just in case there's paparazzi.
