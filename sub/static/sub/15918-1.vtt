00:26.624 --> 00:29.251
Hey.

00:29.376 --> 00:31.796
Is everything okay?

00:31.921 --> 00:35.257
Yeah.

00:35.382 --> 00:36.676
No.

00:36.801 --> 00:38.260
I need to see you.

00:41.221 --> 00:44.767
Look, I know it's
late, or early,

00:44.892 --> 00:46.936
depending on your perspective.

00:47.061 --> 00:48.688
It's just that my car
drove me over here.

00:48.813 --> 00:51.941
I told her not to.

00:52.066 --> 00:55.987
But you know how pushy
foreign cars can be.

00:57.780 --> 00:59.974
Look, babe, I...

00:59.981 --> 01:03.777
I know I haven't called you in
a minute, but I need to
see you. I need to come inside.

01:03.902 --> 01:05.236
I got to get on the other side.

01:05.361 --> 01:07.280
Can you let me in?

01:11.451 --> 01:12.744
Hold on.

01:16.414 --> 01:18.054
You're not calling
the police, are you?

03:13.907 --> 03:17.619
Please, god, if he's mine,

03:17.744 --> 03:20.204
just give me a sign.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.013
Get me...

03:37.138 --> 03:39.766
Go to the bathroom, go to the bathroom.
Go to the bathroom!

03:44.353 --> 03:46.481
Thank you.

03:50.735 --> 03:53.529
It's not funny.

03:53.655 --> 03:56.699
Yeah, it is.

03:56.825 --> 03:59.160
I'm sorry.

04:04.499 --> 04:05.416
Whew.

04:05.541 --> 04:06.542
Look...

04:06.668 --> 04:08.837
Look, don't
say "look."

04:08.962 --> 04:10.797
I mean, you know, I'm drunk,

04:10.922 --> 04:13.842
but I had to do something

04:13.967 --> 04:16.344
so I could tell you what
I needed to tell you.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.559
I love you.

04:23.685 --> 04:26.228
Don't say that.

04:29.482 --> 04:32.485
I...

04:32.610 --> 04:35.279
love...

04:40.535 --> 04:43.454
you.

04:49.585 --> 04:51.504
Let me, um...

04:51.629 --> 04:54.883
...let me go get you some
sparkling water for your stomach.

04:55.008 --> 04:57.552
It will settle it down.

05:20.533 --> 05:22.577
Ahh!

05:35.840 --> 05:36.716
Get out!
Ah!

05:36.841 --> 05:37.967
Get out.

05:38.093 --> 05:39.552
Get out of my house.

05:39.677 --> 05:41.637
You are a freaking liar.

05:41.763 --> 05:44.473
And you let me kiss you
and vomit on your... ahh!

05:44.599 --> 05:45.975
But I said I love you.

05:46.101 --> 05:49.437
You kiss my ass, kiss my ass!

05:49.562 --> 05:50.438
Are you crazy?

05:50.563 --> 05:51.940
How do you forget about a wife?

05:52.065 --> 05:54.316
You stupid idiot!

05:54.442 --> 05:57.445
Get out, get out!

05:59.948 --> 06:02.992
Get out.

06:03.118 --> 06:05.327
I can't drive home.

06:05.453 --> 06:06.829
I'm drunk.

06:06.955 --> 06:08.212
You know what, good.

06:08.213 --> 06:10.541
There's a tree right
down the street.

06:10.666 --> 06:12.835
Why don't you hit it?

06:16.172 --> 06:17.712
What am I gonna do
without my shoe?

Mary Jane Paul.

08:39.644 --> 08:40.937
Yeah.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.591
O-M-G,
Mary Jane Paul.

08:45.630 --> 08:50.029
I know you probably get this all the time,
but, could I get a picture with you?

08:50.155 --> 08:52.865
- My wife watches you every day.
- Oh.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.951
Sir, you were just
in an accident.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.035
Just a quick one?

08:56.161 --> 08:58.330
Okay, fine, but I want one too.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.916
Smile, Mary Jane.

09:02.041 --> 09:02.708
Hey, mom, hey...

09:02.834 --> 09:04.710
You know, I'm losing you.

09:04.836 --> 09:07.255
Yeah, if I lose you,
I'll call you right back.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.548
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

09:09.674 --> 09:13.303
He brought a fast-tail
gal in my house.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.888
<i>Now, he can't pay a bill</i>

09:16.014 --> 09:17.556
or even buy a loaf of bread.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.059
But he has the nerve to screw

09:20.185 --> 09:21.894
some tramp in my house.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.105
I'm telling you, in my house.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.607
Mom... oh, God, I'm on the elevator.
I'm losing you.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.985
You know what, if we
break up, I... what?

09:29.110 --> 09:30.487
I can't hear you.

09:30.611 --> 09:32.571
I'll call you back,
bye, mom, love you.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.532
I can hear you.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.920
Hey.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.047
They're almost done.

09:49.172 --> 09:50.824
Oh, good, there's still time.
Here you go.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.802
I will call you back, mom.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.762
Thanks.

09:59.724 --> 10:00.725
Hi.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.310
Hey.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.936
How's your mom,
is she feeling better?

10:04.062 --> 10:04.979
Fine.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.605
Yeah, no, she's...
she's good.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.858
- That was her on the phone.
- You can call her back.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.693
No, no, no, no,
she's fine, she's fine.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.320
So, where were we?

10:12.445 --> 10:14.239
We're done.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.614
Great job, Kara.
Thank you.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.868
Can you get Mary Jane
all caught up?

10:19.100 --> 10:20.101
Of course.

10:20.226 --> 10:23.980
I love, love the
African women story.

10:24.105 --> 10:26.069
I can't wait to see what
you do with it tomorrow.

10:26.070 --> 10:28.876
Okay.

10:28.901 --> 10:29.944
Great.

10:30.069 --> 10:32.364
Bye-bye.

10:38.870 --> 10:42.028
So did you sell it, or did they sell
you on the rapee African story?

10:42.029 --> 10:43.458
Hey, not fair.

10:43.583 --> 10:45.585
I pitched my ass off.

10:45.710 --> 10:49.255
I had my visual aids
and everything.

10:49.381 --> 10:51.341
I know how important
that story is to you.

10:51.466 --> 10:54.052
And where were you?

10:56.221 --> 10:57.138
Are you okay?

10:57.263 --> 10:59.307
I'm fine, I'm fine.

11:01.059 --> 11:03.769
- They think it's a blog story.
- It's five days out.

11:03.895 --> 11:06.523
Exactly, MJ, it's old.

11:06.648 --> 11:08.483
Okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

11:08.608 --> 11:12.153
Okay, here's how we angle it.

11:12.278 --> 11:13.321
Black women aren't ugly.

11:13.446 --> 11:16.575
We're invisible.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.117
I get quotes from Ralph Ellison.

11:18.243 --> 11:19.327
Oh, Ralph Ellison.

11:19.452 --> 11:22.788
Wow, set the DVR right after I look
him up to see who the hell he is.

11:22.914 --> 11:24.457
You know this is ridiculous.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.126
No major magazine should be able
to get away with this crap,

11:27.252 --> 11:28.961
and nobody even raises
an eyebrow.

11:29.087 --> 11:30.463
Look, I'm disgusted, too,

11:30.589 --> 11:33.550
but it's their network, and Greg's
not gonna let you do the story.

11:33.675 --> 11:34.835
No, no, no, we sold this show

11:34.926 --> 11:38.804
part news, part my platform.

11:38.930 --> 11:41.266
Oh, that's funny,
because up until now,

11:41.391 --> 11:43.268
I thought it was our platform.

11:43.393 --> 11:45.311
I said "our."

11:45.437 --> 11:47.146
Kara,
I said "our."

11:47.272 --> 11:50.233
Look, we could do more of your
platform when your ratings go up.

11:50.358 --> 11:52.360
Until then, I could
use your suggestions

11:52.485 --> 11:53.819
on the rapee Africans.

11:53.945 --> 11:57.240
Now, I got to go
check on the show.

11:57.365 --> 11:58.908
Fine, fine.

12:04.456 --> 12:08.418
Your dress is undone.

12:12.297 --> 12:14.798
See you later.

12:19.304 --> 12:20.263
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:20.388 --> 12:21.309
Your mom keeps calling.

12:21.431 --> 12:24.183
Oh, I bet she does.

12:32.358 --> 12:35.487
Hi, mom.

12:35.612 --> 12:36.613
You didn't call me back.

12:36.738 --> 12:40.032
You ignoring me like
your father?

12:40.158 --> 12:42.201
No, no, mom.

12:42.327 --> 12:44.162
Did you take your
medicine on time today?

12:46.748 --> 12:50.543
That boy don't do
anything on time.

12:50.669 --> 12:53.087
Wasn't even born on time.

12:53.212 --> 12:56.174
Hold on.

12:58.301 --> 13:00.052
<i>Checks the runners,</i>
<i>fastball on the corner.</i>

13:00.178 --> 13:01.429
<i>Strike one,</i>
<i>a 91 mile-an hour...</i>

13:01.554 --> 13:02.430
What?

13:02.555 --> 13:04.432
Patrick, can you please take mom

13:04.557 --> 13:08.894
a glass of water and
her medicine upstairs now?

13:09.020 --> 13:10.062
I already did.

13:10.188 --> 13:11.105
<i>No, you didn't.</i>

13:11.230 --> 13:12.524
What?

13:12.649 --> 13:14.588
<i>The pitcher is taking</i>
<i>his time today, Jim.</i>

13:16.454 --> 13:19.905
Okay, so now that that's handled, do you
want me to talk to Paul about the girls?

13:20.031 --> 13:22.241
Can't I just vent?

13:22.367 --> 13:24.703
Yeah, mom.

13:24.828 --> 13:26.996
Look, I'm... I'm
about to go on air,

13:27.121 --> 13:28.080
so I gotta go.

13:28.206 --> 13:28.998
<i>I know.</i>

13:29.123 --> 13:33.252
Don't wear that ugly orange
lipstick you had on yesterday.

13:33.378 --> 13:34.295
It was coral.

13:34.420 --> 13:36.964
Oh, well, it's
attacking your face.

13:38.550 --> 13:40.926
And yes, I do want
you to talk to Paul,

13:41.052 --> 13:43.179
but don't be hard on him.

13:43.304 --> 13:46.641
Hey, mom?

13:46.766 --> 13:47.933
Happy birthday.

13:49.769 --> 13:51.187
<i>Ain't nothing happy about it.</i>

13:51.312 --> 13:52.230
<i>Bye.</i>

13:52.355 --> 13:54.065
Bye.

14:11.082 --> 14:13.042
No, no, no, no.

14:13.167 --> 14:15.795
Stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it,

14:15.920 --> 14:18.172
stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it.

14:18.297 --> 14:21.133
Stop it.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.243
You can go anywhere
for your news.

14:31.273 --> 14:33.108
I appreciate that
you come here first.

14:33.348 --> 14:34.558
I'm Mark Bradley.

14:34.683 --> 14:37.018
Have a great rest of your day.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.770
See you on set.

14:43.108 --> 14:43.983
Hey.

14:44.109 --> 14:46.403
Hey, MJ.

14:50.115 --> 14:51.241
Hey, chief.

14:51.366 --> 14:52.701
See that game last night?

14:52.825 --> 14:54.327
Sick, right? Yeah, it was a great game.
You see the game last night?

14:54.453 --> 14:56.871
You okay?
Yep.

14:56.996 --> 14:59.165
You get a chance to
look over the stories?

14:59.291 --> 15:01.543
- Yep.
- All right, good.

15:01.668 --> 15:06.256
Well, you have a great show.

15:06.381 --> 15:09.301
I'm looking forward to
having a great show, too.

15:09.426 --> 15:11.511
Thank you.

15:11.637 --> 15:13.972
Ronnie, we need the
"Talkback" bumper.

15:14.097 --> 15:14.931
Mm.

15:15.056 --> 15:16.349
Hey, you didn't call me back.

15:16.475 --> 15:17.850
I know, I went to bed early.

15:17.976 --> 15:18.560
Yeah, okay.

15:18.685 --> 15:19.852
Spoiler alert:
someone dies.

15:19.978 --> 15:21.731
What?
Look, if you could DVR tonight,

15:21.754 --> 15:23.289
I got a window between
8:00 and 10:00.

15:23.315 --> 15:24.274
Date.
Okay.

15:24.399 --> 15:26.485
- I like your tie.
- Oh, thank you.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.839
- What's going on with your eyes?
- 20 seconds, everyone.

15:28.840 --> 15:32.115
Nothing, nothing.

15:32.240 --> 15:32.865
Nothing.

15:32.991 --> 15:34.409
Break a leg.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.203
All right, all right.

Always.

Make a wish, mom.

16:20.622 --> 16:21.456
Mom.

16:21.581 --> 16:22.999
Mom, are you all right?

16:23.124 --> 16:24.459
Breathe.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.503
Just breathe, mom,
just breathe, okay?

16:26.628 --> 16:27.587
Put this on.

16:27.713 --> 16:29.047
Put this on, mom, mom, breathe.

16:29.172 --> 16:31.007
No, just put out this inferno

16:31.132 --> 16:32.912
and cut up the cake,
and get on out of here.

16:32.913 --> 16:35.261
Mom, put this on,
come on, come on.

16:35.387 --> 16:36.555
Relax, mom, just relax.

16:36.680 --> 16:39.265
- Slow, slow, mom, slow.
- Mm.

16:39.391 --> 16:40.308
Breathe, mom.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.685
Don't you see I'm dealing with it?
See, she's doing better?

16:42.686 --> 16:43.729
Just back up.

16:44.646 --> 16:46.732
Here, Patrick.

16:48.358 --> 16:51.486
Slow, slow breaths, slow
breaths, slow breaths.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.572
It's okay, baby.

17:10.714 --> 17:13.592
She's gonna be okay, dad.

17:20.766 --> 17:23.518
I just...

17:23.643 --> 17:26.145
I just wish she'd go on and die.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.027
You don't mean that.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.280
I know you don't.

17:37.532 --> 17:40.410
Yes, I do.

17:41.870 --> 17:44.330
I just wish that you'd know

17:44.456 --> 17:46.499
that kind of love one day.

17:46.625 --> 17:50.002
I hope you all do.

17:59.471 --> 18:00.346
Where's mom?

18:00.472 --> 18:02.181
In the bed.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.572
Oh, you got her up
there that fast?

18:03.600 --> 18:06.352
Yeah, how bout that?

18:06.478 --> 18:08.104
Can we stop, please?

18:08.229 --> 18:09.188
I didn't start it.

18:12.567 --> 18:14.778
I love you.

18:16.613 --> 18:18.406
I love you, Patrick.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.617
- Tell me you love me, tell me you love me.
- Stop playin', girl.

18:20.742 --> 18:23.662
- Tell me you love me, tell me you love me.
- Get off me.

18:25.455 --> 18:27.582
Hey, look.

18:29.835 --> 18:34.339
Let me get 500 from you.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.125
If you guys need me to help
you with the budget, I can...

18:36.126 --> 18:40.637
No, I need you to
help me with $500.

18:40.762 --> 18:42.555
Patrick, you guys
stay here for free.

18:42.681 --> 18:45.642
I mean, you and Tracy
eat for free.

18:45.767 --> 18:48.895
You don't have to
bring me in this.

18:49.020 --> 18:51.121
What happens to the
money that I got

18:51.122 --> 18:53.192
the state to pay you
to take care of mom?

18:53.193 --> 18:55.401
I mean, where does that
money go, Patrick?

18:55.550 --> 18:56.863
Get out my face with that, okay?

18:56.864 --> 18:58.702
I should get half,
considering I still gotta

18:58.703 --> 19:00.314
come over here and do
everything anyway.

19:00.315 --> 19:01.867
Who got her breathing
again, huh?

19:01.992 --> 19:03.952
She wouldn't have
the coughing fit

19:04.076 --> 19:06.538
if you gave her
her medicine on time.

19:06.663 --> 19:09.382
I don't need a lecture.
I just asked you for a favor.

19:12.377 --> 19:14.212
Wow.

19:14.337 --> 19:18.675
For the record, he gives
her everything on time.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.807
Bitch.

19:46.970 --> 19:48.178
Whew.

19:48.304 --> 19:50.498
- Here.
- Wow.

19:50.588 --> 19:51.885
You guys couldn't wait
till I got off?

19:51.886 --> 19:55.635
- You know this might be her last birthday.
- Might not.

19:55.760 --> 19:58.471
Was she happy?

19:58.596 --> 20:00.515
Right.

20:00.640 --> 20:01.724
So you want to talk
about that girl

20:01.850 --> 20:03.726
you had over to
the house last night?

20:03.852 --> 20:06.771
I didn't have a girl
over at the...

20:06.896 --> 20:08.481
It was her only rule when
she let you move back in.

20:08.606 --> 20:10.316
Yeah, I know.

20:10.401 --> 20:11.522
I gotta get up out of there.

20:11.526 --> 20:13.657
And twirling a sign and selling
weed ain't gonna cut it.

20:13.718 --> 20:15.337
See, I knew I shouldn't
have sold to your friends.

20:15.363 --> 20:17.573
But FYI, they're my
best customers.

20:17.699 --> 20:20.201
Paul.
Pauletta.

20:20.326 --> 20:21.369
Don't call me that.

20:21.494 --> 20:23.579
I'm not calling you by that
stupid name you made up.

20:23.705 --> 20:27.082
Matter of fact, why don't you keep
my secrets, and I keep yours?

20:27.208 --> 20:29.084
Hey, roll to the Pitch & Putt.

20:29.210 --> 20:30.169
I gotta get mom a card.

20:30.294 --> 20:31.420
I already put your
name on a gift.

20:31.546 --> 20:34.256
Yeah, but I brought a chick
home, so I gotta put in extra.

20:34.382 --> 20:35.132
Come on.

20:38.803 --> 20:40.471
Okay, thanks.

20:40.596 --> 20:42.264
How you doing?

20:42.390 --> 20:43.474
<i>Call me back, MJ.</i>

20:43.599 --> 20:45.518
<i>This is the fifth</i>
<i>message I've left you.</i>

20:45.643 --> 20:47.102
<i>We need to talk.</i>

20:47.228 --> 20:48.604
<i>I love you.</i>

20:48.730 --> 20:50.009
<i>Call me back, please...</i>

20:53.359 --> 20:55.486
Appreciate that.

20:55.611 --> 20:57.613
Booyah.

20:57.739 --> 20:59.114
Really?
What?

20:59.240 --> 21:02.577
Look, I thought it
was a great complement

21:02.702 --> 21:04.704
to the incense I got her.

21:04.829 --> 21:06.706
What, so she can choke?

21:13.295 --> 21:15.297
I got a few of those
on my phone, too.

21:15.423 --> 21:16.465
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

21:16.591 --> 21:17.842
Who are you avoiding, David?

21:17.967 --> 21:20.887
Or is David "Never Answer #1"?

21:21.012 --> 21:22.252
Why do you always bring him up?

21:22.263 --> 21:23.973
Look, you may be
over him, but come on,

21:24.098 --> 21:26.517
dude had season tickets
to the Hawks.

21:29.562 --> 21:30.521
Ahh.

21:30.646 --> 21:32.273
What?

21:32.398 --> 21:33.524
Hey, look.

21:33.649 --> 21:35.693
Every time I think about him busting
you going through his phone.

21:35.818 --> 21:36.861
Shut up.

21:40.782 --> 21:42.867
Come on, come on,
come on, it was classic.

21:42.992 --> 21:46.037
I mean, you were all
in his bathroom,

21:46.161 --> 21:49.373
copying pictures,
reading his text messages.

21:49.498 --> 21:51.459
He outside running around
looking for his phone,

21:51.584 --> 21:53.544
and then he asked
you if you had it,

21:53.669 --> 21:55.671
and you were like,
"nope," and then,

21:55.797 --> 21:57.423
beep-beep, beep-beep.

21:57.548 --> 21:59.341
"David, Apple has
found your iPhone,

21:59.467 --> 22:01.677
and it's in the hands of
your lying-ass girl."

22:01.803 --> 22:04.847
Shut up, shut up.

22:04.973 --> 22:07.433
I swear I tell that story
at least once a day.

22:09.477 --> 22:11.228
It was the lowest
point of my life.

22:13.856 --> 22:16.484
You know, one day you're
gonna actually believe

22:16.609 --> 22:19.821
that you're the baddest chick in
the game, like you purport to be,

22:19.946 --> 22:22.448
and your life is only
gonna get better.

22:22.573 --> 22:24.575
You watch.

22:24.700 --> 22:28.621
Eat your cake.

22:28.746 --> 22:30.748
Unh.

22:31.666 --> 22:33.751
Right.

22:33.876 --> 22:36.504
- This is good. - Yeah.
- This is real good.

22:36.629 --> 22:39.757
- Yeah, enjoy it, 'cause it
might be dinner too.
- Why?

22:39.882 --> 22:41.842
You know Patrick's got
Tracy up over at the house.

22:41.843 --> 22:43.218
Oh, hell.

22:43.344 --> 22:44.553
That fool love them
any way they come,

22:44.679 --> 22:45.680
as long as they big, huh?

22:45.805 --> 22:47.473
My god, huge.

22:47.598 --> 22:49.266
Hey, but they made a
cute little girl, though.

22:49.391 --> 22:50.559
You seen Daisha?

22:50.685 --> 22:52.854
She gonna be tall and cute.

22:52.979 --> 22:54.730
Yeah, it's not so cute

22:54.856 --> 22:56.482
when it's one more
mouth to feed.

22:56.607 --> 22:58.860
Hm, not happy about
being an aunt again?

22:58.985 --> 23:01.772
Wonder how long it was gonna
take you to get to your soapbox.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.800
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing, nothing.

23:05.825 --> 23:07.242
No, no, what are
you talking about?

23:07.368 --> 23:08.911
Girl, girl, go,
I don't know nothing.

23:09.037 --> 23:11.413
I'm trying to eat my cake.

23:13.916 --> 23:15.501
<i>Animosity between me and Mike,</i>

23:15.626 --> 23:17.962
<i>and I just let it build up,</i>
<i>and build up, and build up.</i>

23:18.087 --> 23:20.923
<i>I can't believe I let</i>
<i>myself get so angry.</i>

23:21.049 --> 23:23.258
Niecy, are you pregnant again?

23:23.384 --> 23:24.010
Huh?

23:24.135 --> 23:26.495
Hey, get out of here with that.
You ain't got to answer her.

23:26.512 --> 23:28.263
Yes, yes, you do.

23:28.389 --> 23:30.223
Cause eventually,
there'll be a stroller,

23:30.349 --> 23:31.017
a little outfit, or a car
to get around in

23:31.142 --> 23:32.977
that auntie here needs to buy.

23:33.102 --> 23:34.395
Ain't that right, Niecy?

23:34.520 --> 23:36.814
You trippin', what's the
matter with you, huh?

23:36.939 --> 23:39.525
What's the matter with me?
Are you kidding me?

23:39.650 --> 23:42.153
You know what, I love you guys.
I really, really do,

23:42.277 --> 23:44.030
but there are too many
damn kids in this family,

23:44.155 --> 23:45.614
and not enough people
feeding them.

23:45.740 --> 23:48.159
Hey, that's enough.

23:48.283 --> 23:51.746
Seriously, who's got
a job in this room?

23:51.871 --> 23:54.874
Who's got a job, raise your hand,
who has a job in this room? 'Letta.

23:54.999 --> 23:55.875
Raise them high.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.585
I said that's enough.

23:57.710 --> 24:00.462
The kids can hear you.

24:05.051 --> 24:07.469
Okay, tomorrow, I will...

24:07.595 --> 24:09.972
...I'll take you to
Dr. Hudson's office,

24:10.098 --> 24:11.306
and we'll get you checked out.

24:11.432 --> 24:14.102
And in the meantime,
no more soda,

24:14.227 --> 24:16.687
tuna sandwiches, aspirin, baths.

24:16.812 --> 24:20.149
Um, I think you're gonna
have to stop nursing.

24:20.273 --> 24:23.903
So, Trevyon is just gonna have to drink
regular milk like everybody else.

24:24.028 --> 24:25.863
Okay?

24:25.988 --> 24:29.408
So call me tomorrow.

24:29.533 --> 24:31.994
I'm sorry, dad.

25:16.082 --> 25:18.089
They think my parents'
house is like

25:18.092 --> 25:19.593
a damn bed and breakfast.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.595
So many frickin' mouths to feed,

25:21.721 --> 25:24.057
my parents can't even keep
up on the damn house.

25:24.182 --> 25:25.975
Pretty.

25:26.100 --> 25:28.644
You know, we were
raised the exact same,

25:28.769 --> 25:31.564
you know, little league,
debutante balls, college.

25:31.689 --> 25:32.857
I don't like those.

25:32.982 --> 25:34.108
No?
No.

25:34.234 --> 25:35.193
They do suck, right?

25:35.318 --> 25:37.611
They do, your ankles
are too big.

25:37.737 --> 25:39.030
Sorry.

25:39.155 --> 25:41.615
Take them off, let's go.

25:41.741 --> 25:45.119
I mean, Paul Jr., look, I get it.
He's in college.

25:45.245 --> 25:49.165
- But freaking graduate already.
- Well, it's like you said
on your show a while back.

25:49.290 --> 25:51.792
The middle class in America
is now the ghetto.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.627
It's the haves and
the have-nots now.

25:53.753 --> 25:56.172
Hello, and I need to have these.

25:56.297 --> 25:57.548
Oh my God.

25:57.673 --> 25:59.675
You can't tell me anything
with these shoes.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.635
Hello, I like those.

26:01.761 --> 26:02.762
Ah.

26:02.887 --> 26:04.306
Nice, right?
Oh, they're like magic.

26:04.429 --> 26:05.973
Please ring these up before
my conscience wakes up.

26:06.099 --> 26:08.475
Uh, you deserve them.

26:09.602 --> 26:10.728
Ooh, I do deserve them.

26:10.853 --> 26:13.231
Yeah, you work hard
for your money, girl.

26:13.356 --> 26:14.481
I do work hard for my money.

26:14.607 --> 26:17.193
Hello, and if you
give it to Patrick,

26:17.318 --> 26:19.112
it'll just end up up his nose.

26:19.237 --> 26:20.947
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Tonya, no.

26:21.072 --> 26:23.490
I can say that.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.118
You cannot say that.

26:25.243 --> 26:26.968
Well, I just said it, so...

26:29.622 --> 26:30.706
Hey, Kara.

26:30.831 --> 26:34.085
So, what do you think about my
guest for our rapee African story?

26:34.210 --> 26:36.003
- You got my email, right?
- Yep.

26:36.129 --> 26:37.171
<i>Hold on.</i>

26:37.297 --> 26:39.048
Max!

26:39.173 --> 26:41.175
Get in the shower, now.

26:41.301 --> 26:43.928
<i>Scott, please feed the dog.</i>

26:45.346 --> 26:46.513
Are you done?

26:46.639 --> 26:47.848
Yes, I'm sorry.

26:47.974 --> 26:50.615
Great, yeah, no, I like it, and I
think it's gonna pair really well

26:50.643 --> 26:51.602
with our first segment.

26:51.727 --> 26:52.686
<i>Great.</i>

26:52.812 --> 26:55.315
Okay, so you read the
first half of her book,

26:55.440 --> 26:57.524
and I'll read the second half.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.526
And, honey, I can not go out tonight.
I'm so damn tired.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.695
I'm already in my sweats.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.072
So I'll just see you
tomorrow, okay?

27:03.197 --> 27:04.157
<i>All right.</i>

27:14.125 --> 27:15.042
And the red purse?

27:15.168 --> 27:17.211
I do like those,
I do, I do, I do.

27:19.172 --> 27:21.715
Sorry, we're closed.

27:21.841 --> 27:25.136
Oh, please?
Five minutes, tops.

27:25.261 --> 27:27.888
Should I let them in?

27:28.014 --> 27:29.432
Yeah, I'm gonna let them in.

27:29.556 --> 27:32.852
He spends a lot of money on his
wife, and I want a new iPad.

27:32.977 --> 27:34.145
Come on in.

27:34.270 --> 27:35.871
Oh, she's coming, she's coming.
Let's go.

27:37.857 --> 27:38.691
Come in, welcome.

27:38.816 --> 27:40.067
You know what, baby,
we'll come back.

27:40.193 --> 27:41.277
Yeah, we'll come
back, when do you open?

27:41.402 --> 27:42.320
10:00 A.M.

27:42.445 --> 27:43.237
We'll be here.
Bright and early.

27:43.363 --> 27:46.115
All right, thank you.
You're welcome.

27:48.951 --> 27:52.205
Isn't it a beautiful thing
when you actually see it?

27:53.873 --> 27:54.915
What?

27:55.041 --> 27:57.001
Black love.

27:57.126 --> 27:59.128
Whew.

27:59.253 --> 28:02.715
It's possible, homey.

28:02.840 --> 28:05.009
Yep.

28:05.134 --> 28:06.802
Mm.

29:01.023 --> 29:02.775
Call Mark.

29:15.162 --> 29:17.873
Yeah, too late, I'm already
getting ready for bed.

29:17.998 --> 29:18.874
It's only 10:05.

29:18.999 --> 29:21.961
Okay, so we can try this
again tomorrow, right?

29:22.086 --> 29:23.963
Okay, good night.

29:24.088 --> 29:27.258
Boo.

30:20.561 --> 30:22.146
Ah!

30:41.999 --> 30:44.084
A woman raping a man in Zimbabwe

30:44.210 --> 30:45.961
is so rare,

30:46.086 --> 30:48.464
that crime is not
even on the books.

30:48.589 --> 30:50.424
So what can they
be charged with?

30:50.550 --> 30:52.343
Well, it's my understanding

30:52.468 --> 30:54.178
that in this case, the charge is

30:54.303 --> 30:55.555
aggravated sexual assault.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.181
You're talking about a society

30:57.306 --> 30:59.266
in which they can't even grasp

30:59.392 --> 31:02.144
the judicial concept
of a woman raping a man.

31:02.269 --> 31:03.770
So, under those circumstances,

31:03.896 --> 31:05.606
they're gonna have a
very difficult time

31:05.731 --> 31:07.233
prosecuting aggravated assault,

31:07.358 --> 31:08.359
sexual or otherwise.

31:08.484 --> 31:11.070
See, in my opinion, they
have a much better case

31:11.195 --> 31:13.947
if they just go with a
simple charge of theft.

31:14.073 --> 31:15.908
Well, how do you place
a value on sperm?

31:16.033 --> 31:18.411
I mean, it's not
like she broke in

31:18.536 --> 31:20.204
and stole his
flat-screen television.

31:20.329 --> 31:22.415
In this case,
the sperm is stolen

31:22.540 --> 31:24.208
to be used in a ritual,
which is where

31:24.333 --> 31:26.293
the value will be coming from.

31:26.419 --> 31:27.545
Basically, what compensation

31:27.670 --> 31:30.339
did the perpetrator receive,

31:30.464 --> 31:34.385
or expect to receive
for their stolen goods?

31:34.510 --> 31:35.230
Goods, good stuff.

31:35.344 --> 31:36.929
Thank you.

31:37.054 --> 31:39.348
Well, our next guest
has already determined

31:39.473 --> 31:40.849
the value of sperm.

31:40.974 --> 31:42.101
Here in the United States,

31:42.226 --> 31:44.186
it's an incredibly
lucrative business.

31:44.311 --> 31:46.146
Samantha Wynn is a
"New York Times"

31:46.272 --> 31:48.941
best-selling author
of <i> Frozen Assets.</i>

31:49.066 --> 31:50.817
She's already raked
in millions of dollars,

31:50.943 --> 31:53.571
vacation homes, and luxury cars.

31:53.696 --> 31:55.615
Samantha, welcome to "Talkback".

31:55.740 --> 31:57.101
Thank you, I'm so
happy to be here.

31:57.199 --> 31:59.034
People have called
you a gold digger.

31:59.159 --> 32:02.162
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- What do you call yourself?

32:02.288 --> 32:04.331
A smart businesswoman.

32:04.457 --> 32:06.584
Well, how does a woman dream up
a business quite like this one?

32:06.709 --> 32:09.086
I was taking a business
class in college,

32:09.211 --> 32:11.964
and our professor said something,
and this light bulb went off.

32:12.089 --> 32:14.508
And what he said was,
"If you want to be

32:14.634 --> 32:17.177
"wealthy long-term,
you have to find

32:17.303 --> 32:19.680
something that
you're passionate about."

32:19.805 --> 32:22.975
So I thought, well, what
am I passionate about?

32:23.100 --> 32:24.191
Rich men.

32:25.603 --> 32:27.521
Oh, we're just getting started.

32:27.647 --> 32:28.897
Stay tuned, we'll be right back

32:29.022 --> 32:32.109
with "Talkback with
Mary Jane Paul".

32:32.234 --> 32:33.860
And clear.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.070
Way to go.

32:35.195 --> 32:36.363
Way to go.

32:36.489 --> 32:38.407
- You're doing a great job. Thank you.
- I love your candor
answering my questions.

32:38.532 --> 32:40.867
Mary Jane, excuse me.

32:40.993 --> 32:43.371
Your brother Patrick is here.
He said it's very important.

32:43.496 --> 32:44.413
We're out 1 minute 30.

32:44.538 --> 32:45.456
If you'll excuse me.

32:45.581 --> 32:46.915
Oh, sure.

32:50.085 --> 32:51.044
What happened?

32:51.170 --> 32:52.505
Huh?
What happened?

32:52.630 --> 32:54.716
Oh, no, this isn't about mom.
She's fine.

32:55.869 --> 32:59.052
Okay, well, what are you doing here?
I'm working.

32:59.178 --> 33:00.805
Look, I just...

33:00.929 --> 33:03.890
I just wanted to see if you could
rethink that money situation.

33:04.016 --> 33:05.184
One minute.

33:05.309 --> 33:08.562
Seriously?

33:08.688 --> 33:11.231
You come up here out of the blue

33:11.357 --> 33:12.692
saying it's an emergency.

33:12.817 --> 33:14.193
I said "important"...
No, no, no.

33:14.318 --> 33:17.363
You had me thinking
mom was dead.

33:17.488 --> 33:20.835
But what you really wanted was
to ask me for some money?

33:21.033 --> 33:22.075
Have you lost...
Mary Jane?

33:22.201 --> 33:23.118
Mm-hmm?

33:23.243 --> 33:24.161
Ready.

33:24.286 --> 33:26.664
Have you lost your damn mind?

33:26.789 --> 33:29.500
No, and don't ask me again.

33:29.625 --> 33:32.044
This is my damn job.

33:34.171 --> 33:35.339
Sorry about that.

33:35.464 --> 33:37.675
All righty.

33:37.800 --> 33:40.093
Sell some books.
Sell some books.

33:40.219 --> 33:41.220
Put it up by your face.

33:41.345 --> 33:42.095
All right.

33:46.056 --> 33:48.000
She's squished in there.

33:48.066 --> 33:50.166
But she looks good.

33:50.243 --> 33:52.329
And you look to be
about 32 weeks.

33:52.454 --> 33:53.913
Yeah, that's what
the clinic said.

33:54.039 --> 33:55.624
32 weeks?

33:55.749 --> 33:59.336
Like, eight months?

34:00.462 --> 34:02.715
- Um, I need to use the restroom.
- Oh, good.

34:02.840 --> 34:06.092
- Put half of it in this cup for me.
- Okay.

34:12.074 --> 34:14.074
Eight months, and you didn't
know she was pregnant?

34:14.100 --> 34:15.518
I thought she was just fat.

34:15.643 --> 34:17.563
God, they eat 24-7,

34:17.688 --> 34:19.938
and she wears those
big t-shirts.

34:20.065 --> 34:21.775
Oh, my...
what am I gonna do?

34:21.900 --> 34:23.318
You don't have to do
anything, you heard her.

34:23.443 --> 34:25.070
She's been getting
prenatal care.

34:25.195 --> 34:26.112
At a clinic.

34:26.237 --> 34:27.947
That's what she can afford.

34:28.072 --> 34:30.701
Turn your car around, 'cause I
see where you're trying to go.

34:30.826 --> 34:31.702
Of course she's gonna
keep having babies

34:31.827 --> 34:34.538
- if you keep taking care of them.
- It's family.

34:34.663 --> 34:36.121
Okay, babysit sometimes.

34:36.248 --> 34:37.331
I do.

34:37.456 --> 34:41.127
That only leads to dreams
of me kidnapping them.

34:42.462 --> 34:45.716
She and her sister have
four kids between them.

34:45.841 --> 34:47.175
Now, I did everything right.

34:47.300 --> 34:50.429
And what do I have to show
for being a good girl?

34:50.554 --> 34:52.179
A wonderful career,
beautiful house.

34:52.304 --> 34:54.139
Mm-hmm.

35:15.495 --> 35:17.372
Why are you trying
to make me feel bad?

35:17.497 --> 35:19.124
What?

35:19.249 --> 35:22.001
If anything, I thought
it'd be inspirational.

35:22.127 --> 35:23.044
You're wrong, Auntie.

35:26.423 --> 35:28.383
What are you gonna do, Niecy?

35:28.508 --> 35:31.553
Go get a job.

35:31.678 --> 35:35.014
Don't you want a life?

35:35.140 --> 35:37.768
- Can I tell you what I really want?
- Yes, please.

35:37.893 --> 35:40.270
- To have my baby shower at your house.
- Oh my God.

35:40.395 --> 35:43.022
And for you to make your coconut cake,
since we just had carrot at grandma's.

35:43.148 --> 35:44.608
Are you serious?

35:44.733 --> 35:46.359
Yes.

35:46.485 --> 35:49.112
Oh my God.

35:49.237 --> 35:51.573
I can't, I can't.

35:54.493 --> 35:57.788
I don't want to talk about
your baby shower, Niecy.

35:57.913 --> 35:59.372
You see, I want
to talk about you,

35:59.498 --> 36:01.374
and your life, and your plans,

36:01.500 --> 36:03.376
what you're good at.

36:03.502 --> 36:05.211
Everybody can't be as beautiful

36:05.337 --> 36:06.379
and together as you are.

36:06.505 --> 36:08.757
No, no, no, you don't
get to use my success

36:08.882 --> 36:11.760
for the reason you can't
get your life together.

36:11.885 --> 36:14.888
Okay, Niecy, having babies

36:15.013 --> 36:18.099
cannot be your biggest
achievement in life.

36:21.353 --> 36:22.674
You want to know
what I'm good at?

36:22.771 --> 36:24.815
What?
Sex.

36:24.940 --> 36:25.899
I even thought about
the porn industry,

36:26.024 --> 36:29.319
but Trevyon gave me all
these damn stretch marks.

36:29.444 --> 36:31.488
What?

36:31.613 --> 36:32.614
It's no big deal.

36:32.739 --> 36:36.284
Yeah, yeah, porn is
still a huge deal.

36:36.409 --> 36:38.871
Huge.

36:38.996 --> 36:41.197
So much so, I don't even have
one of my witty comebacks.

36:41.206 --> 36:43.542
I am so freakin' shocked.

36:43.667 --> 36:45.794
Are you kidding me?

36:45.919 --> 36:48.380
I mean, look at Kim Kardashian.

36:48.505 --> 36:51.550
She started off in porn,
and she's making millions.

36:51.675 --> 36:54.678
I don't think she
meant to, okay?

36:54.803 --> 36:57.180
Now who's being naive?

36:57.305 --> 36:59.474
- Is this a joke?
- No.

36:59.599 --> 37:02.227
- Is this whole conversation a joke?
- No.

37:06.356 --> 37:09.359
But you want to know
what's real funny?

37:13.405 --> 37:15.782
- Dante got another girl pregnant.
- Oh my God.

37:15.908 --> 37:17.200
Don't say nothing smart, Auntie.

37:17.325 --> 37:18.565
Please don't say nothing smart.

37:18.618 --> 37:22.664
There is nothing smart
about this conversation.

37:22.789 --> 37:24.958
And since she know
I got his baby too,

37:25.083 --> 37:27.627
she's having her baby shower the
same day as mines,

37:27.753 --> 37:30.630
even though she's only
six months pregnant.

37:30.756 --> 37:32.215
And I know he's
gonna go to hers,

37:32.340 --> 37:33.425
'cause it's, like,
his real girlfriend.

37:33.550 --> 37:35.594
His real girlfriend.
But I thought...

37:35.719 --> 37:38.638
But if I had it at your
house, you know, he'd come.

37:38.764 --> 37:41.391
So can I please have my baby
shower at your house?

37:41.516 --> 37:43.476
Please?

37:45.437 --> 37:48.147
What?

37:50.525 --> 37:51.860
What are you doing?

37:51.985 --> 37:53.194
Something even more stupid

37:53.319 --> 37:54.821
than you getting pregnant again.

37:54.947 --> 37:58.241
Just, sit tight,
I'll be right back.

38:04.456 --> 38:06.583
That'll be $17.

38:44.871 --> 38:45.872
I... hi.

38:45.998 --> 38:48.249
I thought that was you.

38:48.374 --> 38:49.668
You're Mary Jane Paul, right?

38:49.793 --> 38:50.710
Yeah.

38:50.836 --> 38:53.338
Oh, God, I love your show.

38:53.463 --> 38:54.589
Oh my God.

38:54.714 --> 38:57.592
That show yesterday, wow.

38:57.717 --> 38:58.957
I mean, you go there, you know?

38:59.011 --> 39:01.220
You really take it to
unexpected places.

39:01.346 --> 39:02.555
Oh, thanks.

39:02.681 --> 39:05.142
No, thank you.

39:05.266 --> 39:06.559
I mean, now that
Oprah's not on anymore,

39:06.685 --> 39:09.646
you really give me something to look
forward to in the middle of my day.

39:09.771 --> 39:12.816
You're just, you're great.

39:12.941 --> 39:14.026
That's great.

39:14.151 --> 39:15.401
Did you know that
me and your husband

39:15.527 --> 39:18.530
have been sleeping together?

39:18.655 --> 39:23.451
Couple times a week for
the last few months?

39:23.576 --> 39:27.288
I'm... I'm sorry,
but I am so tired

39:27.413 --> 39:28.665
of him getting away with this,

39:28.790 --> 39:32.002
and causing you to live
a lie, and me to cry.

39:32.127 --> 39:34.671
He has known the truth,
and now I know the truth,

39:34.796 --> 39:37.883
and I just... I just thought
you should know the truth.

39:39.551 --> 39:42.595
Um...

39:42.721 --> 39:44.806
...what, uh...

39:44.931 --> 39:48.267
what was your goal here?

39:48.393 --> 39:51.897
For you to know the truth.

39:52.022 --> 39:54.191
Okay.

39:54.315 --> 39:57.448
And now that I know, what do you
want me to do with that information?

39:58.862 --> 40:02.448
Um, I don't know?

40:02.574 --> 40:05.243
I...

40:05.368 --> 40:08.371
It's up to you to figure
that out, I guess.

40:10.874 --> 40:13.459
Oh.

40:13.585 --> 40:15.253
Okay.

40:15.921 --> 40:19.340
Well, do you mind,

40:19.465 --> 40:22.010
helping me figure it out?

40:22.135 --> 40:23.402
You thought it was so
important that I know,

40:23.428 --> 40:25.013
perhaps you'll find it
equally important

40:25.138 --> 40:27.015
to help me figure
out if I should keep

40:27.140 --> 40:28.683
the father of my two children,

40:28.808 --> 40:31.061
who I'm madly in love with.

40:32.896 --> 40:34.898
I'm just so tired.

40:35.023 --> 40:37.316
You're tired.

40:37.442 --> 40:40.695
I'm here trying to figure out
what kind of kitty litter to buy,

40:40.820 --> 40:42.822
because my girlfriend found
out three days ago

40:42.948 --> 40:45.836
that her husband is leaving her
for his 28-year-old assistant.

40:47.535 --> 40:48.494
She hasn't slept.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.280
The kids don't know why
they can't come home,

40:50.281 --> 40:53.507
and the cat has nowhere
else to defecate. So, thank you.

40:54.084 --> 40:57.712
But I think I'll keep him,

40:57.837 --> 41:01.424
and count my blessings
your news wasn't worse.

41:11.517 --> 41:14.520
Do you have any diseases
I need to know about?

41:14.646 --> 41:17.732
No.

41:17.857 --> 41:20.777
No, um...

41:20.902 --> 41:22.988
...we always
use condoms.

41:29.161 --> 41:31.370
You can go.

41:43.713 --> 41:44.693
Alright.

41:44.734 --> 41:47.010
No, no, let's just
keep it simple.

41:47.068 --> 41:48.102
I just want a Brazilian.

41:48.184 --> 41:51.729
Thanks, Mara, bye.

41:51.854 --> 41:55.858
Well, who are you getting
all cleaned up for?

41:55.891 --> 41:56.892
John called.

41:57.017 --> 41:58.185
Really?
Yes.

41:58.311 --> 42:01.647
In a very sincere tone,
he wants to talk.

42:01.732 --> 42:03.212
I think he wants
to get back together.

42:03.213 --> 42:06.986
I don't know, maybe not,
but it's just in case.

42:07.111 --> 42:08.237
Okay.

42:08.362 --> 42:10.072
Why are you looking like that?

42:10.197 --> 42:11.698
It's been five months.

42:11.824 --> 42:14.827
I went nine months once.

42:14.952 --> 42:15.702
I get it.

42:15.828 --> 42:17.621
Yeah, so did I
when I was married.

42:17.746 --> 42:18.580
I mean...

42:21.255 --> 42:23.936
- Hey, did you see the
ratings from last night?
- Yeah. Great, right?

42:23.961 --> 42:26.630
We did great numbers, yep.

42:26.755 --> 42:28.757
Yeah, great numbers.

42:28.882 --> 42:30.092
Mm-hmm.

42:30.217 --> 42:34.221
So go upstairs and get me
my ugly black woman story.

42:34.347 --> 42:35.973
MJ, you need to let that go.

42:36.098 --> 42:39.768
- Nobody cares about that story...
- I care about that story.

42:39.893 --> 42:42.646
I have a niece that
wants to do porn.

42:45.316 --> 42:48.194
Porn.

42:48.319 --> 42:50.779
I can't help you
with that, girl.

42:50.904 --> 42:51.571
Okay.

42:54.033 --> 42:54.992
Wait a minute.

42:55.117 --> 42:56.743
MJ, wait a minute.

42:56.869 --> 42:58.190
Somebody's got to
have some balls.

42:58.245 --> 42:59.663
Stop for a minute,
wait a minute.

42:59.788 --> 43:01.790
You need to calm down,
we have to...

43:01.915 --> 43:02.958
Somebody's got to have
balls in this relationship.

43:03.083 --> 43:04.793
No, you're not
gonna... wait.

43:04.918 --> 43:06.295
Let's not talk about
balls right now, okay?

43:06.420 --> 43:07.713
We need to think this through,

43:07.838 --> 43:10.341
and this has to be
approached very carefully.

43:10.466 --> 43:11.717
You understand?
You know what?

43:11.842 --> 43:13.052
This is a nonissue for you,

43:13.177 --> 43:14.845
because Latinas are celebrated.

43:14.970 --> 43:16.638
No one's ever called
a Latina ugly.

43:16.763 --> 43:19.350
You know, I don't
get you sometimes.

43:19.475 --> 43:20.809
One minute, you don't want
all the black stories,

43:20.934 --> 43:24.313
and the next minute, you
want to play the race card.

43:24.438 --> 43:28.150
I'm not trying to play the race card.
This is about responsibility.

43:28.275 --> 43:29.318
I get that.

43:29.443 --> 43:31.153
Truly, I get that.

43:31.278 --> 43:32.821
But if you march
up there right now,

43:32.946 --> 43:34.948
you are just gonna be another
angry black woman

43:35.074 --> 43:37.993
fighting for a story that's
been dead for seven days.

43:38.118 --> 43:40.162
And this network, you and I,

43:40.287 --> 43:42.498
we can't afford
to look like a joke,

43:42.622 --> 43:46.508
because we're already in fifth place in
a race that only has five networks, MJ.

43:47.127 --> 43:49.588
Remember, this isn't
the end game.

43:49.713 --> 43:52.425
You and I promised
each other nightly news.

43:52.550 --> 43:55.677
And I've already uprooted
my family

43:55.802 --> 43:59.806
and lost a husband
trying to get there.

44:04.061 --> 44:06.813
Okay.

44:37.303 --> 44:39.012
<i>What?</i>

44:39.138 --> 44:40.389
H... hey.

44:40.514 --> 44:42.015
Girl, it's your aunt.

44:42.141 --> 44:43.058
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

44:43.183 --> 44:44.518
I know.

44:44.642 --> 44:47.480
Look, so I just made
a cake that feeds 30.

44:47.605 --> 44:49.231
<i>Auntie, what?</i>

44:49.348 --> 44:50.508
<i>Thank you, thank you so much.</i>

44:50.509 --> 44:52.234
30, Niecy, that's it,
I'm serious.

44:52.359 --> 44:53.444
<i>I know, I know, I know.</i>

44:53.569 --> 44:55.410
<i>You just always come through for me.
Thank you.</i>

44:55.488 --> 44:56.738
You're welcome.

44:56.863 --> 44:59.241
<i>And, Auntie, I'm really sorry
you're just now finding out.</i>

44:59.366 --> 45:01.201
<i>I was so scared to tell you.</i>

45:02.119 --> 45:04.371
Oh, hey, babe, I gotta go, okay?

45:04.497 --> 45:05.831
<i>- Kay, call me back. I love you.
- Love you too, bye.</i>

45:05.956 --> 45:10.294
<i>TV time with Mark.</i>

45:14.507 --> 45:17.259
<i>- What do you want, Tyler?
- You know, I haven't decided yet.</i>

45:17.384 --> 45:18.802
<i>Money would be nice.</i>

45:18.927 --> 45:19.719
Call Mark.

45:19.845 --> 45:20.887
<i>Stay by your phone.</i>

45:21.013 --> 45:22.389
<i>- Oh, and if you do anything rash...
- Hello.</i>

45:22.515 --> 45:24.850
Yeah, yeah, I'm watching.

45:24.975 --> 45:26.393
<i>Ah, look who's on time?</i>

45:26.519 --> 45:27.811
<i>Goodbye.</i>

45:27.936 --> 45:29.188
<i>Help me.</i>

45:29.313 --> 45:30.939
Shut up, oh my God!

45:31.064 --> 45:32.191
<i>Oh my God.</i>

45:32.316 --> 45:35.110
<i>Finish watching the opening</i>
<i>credits and call me back,</i>

45:35.235 --> 45:36.406
<i>'cause I gotta go</i>
<i>to the bathroom.</i>

45:36.407 --> 45:38.738
Okay, okay.

45:38.864 --> 45:40.324
No, no, no, no, slow down.

45:40.449 --> 45:42.576
Stop, stop.

45:42.700 --> 45:45.245
<i>I've been waiting for the
right moment to let you know.</i>

45:45.371 --> 45:47.331
<i>You're doing all right, mom.</i>

45:47.456 --> 45:48.915
<i>I know this is new</i>
<i>for both of us,</i>

45:49.041 --> 45:51.918
<i>but so far so good.</i>

45:52.044 --> 45:55.381
<i>You don't always get it right on the
first try, but you're learning.</i>

45:55.506 --> 45:58.050
<i>You pick up my sock</i>
<i>every time I drop it.</i>

45:58.175 --> 45:59.593
<i>That never gets old.</i>

45:59.717 --> 46:01.303
<i>And you scrub behind my ears.</i>

46:01.428 --> 46:03.347
<i>How do you know?</i>

46:03.472 --> 46:05.932
<i>And your bedtime stories</i>
<i>blow me away.</i>

46:44.555 --> 46:46.973
<i>Yo, it is crazy.</i>

46:47.099 --> 46:49.976
<i>Didn't I tell you,</i>
<i>it's crazy, right?</i>

46:50.102 --> 46:51.062
Can I come over?

47:27.180 --> 47:30.725
I'm so tired of all
my misfires with guys.

47:31.225 --> 47:33.645
Mm-hmm.

47:33.770 --> 47:36.606
I don't want to be a cliché.

47:36.731 --> 47:39.233
You know, I want to be
the exception to the rule.

47:39.359 --> 47:41.068
I know.

47:41.194 --> 47:46.073
'Cause you know, I am the exception to
the rule in every aspect of my life.

47:46.199 --> 47:48.326
Except that.

47:48.451 --> 47:51.579
Mm.

47:51.705 --> 47:54.499
I guess I just kind of
feel like I'm...

47:56.292 --> 47:58.419
I'm running out of time.

47:58.545 --> 48:03.090
Well, Miss Mary Jane,

48:03.216 --> 48:08.054
you know, finding
someone to love you,

48:08.179 --> 48:11.057
can't put him in your
little calendar.

48:11.182 --> 48:12.517
Hm.

48:12.642 --> 48:14.893
That's why it's special.

48:19.482 --> 48:20.605
You okay, lady?

48:20.606 --> 48:22.360
- Oh.
- Better.

48:26.113 --> 48:27.365
Hey.
Hey to you.

48:27.490 --> 48:29.784
Hi.

48:29.908 --> 48:31.920
I got wine on the way,
if you need more.

48:31.921 --> 48:34.288
No, I'm gonna go.

48:34.414 --> 48:35.373
Oh, no, come on.

48:35.498 --> 48:36.374
Nah.
Yeah?

48:36.499 --> 48:38.585
I'm gonna go.

48:38.710 --> 48:41.045
All right, well,
you need a ride?

48:41.170 --> 48:42.296
No, I'm gonna walk.

48:42.422 --> 48:45.007
My gosh, all right,
let me walk you out.

48:45.132 --> 48:46.426
- Good night.
- Good night, baby.

48:46.551 --> 48:47.552
Farmers market Sunday.

48:47.677 --> 48:49.345
Yes.

48:56.853 --> 48:59.188
<i>I can remember</i>
<i>being in the bathtub</i>

48:59.313 --> 49:02.024
<i>asking my mom to put</i>
<i>bleach in the water</i>

49:02.149 --> 49:06.863
<i>so that my skin would be lighter</i>

49:06.987 --> 49:10.157
<i>and so that I could</i>
<i>escape the feelings</i>

49:10.283 --> 49:13.035
<i>that I had about</i>
<i>not being as beautiful,</i>

49:13.160 --> 49:16.497
<i>as acceptable, as loveable.</i>

49:16.623 --> 49:18.207
<i>And we're all just</i>
<i>hanging around,</i>

49:18.332 --> 49:22.128
<i>and a dark-skinned girl</i>
<i>will pass by.</i>

49:22.253 --> 49:24.589
<i>It'll be, "Oh,</i>
<i>well, she's pretty</i>

49:24.714 --> 49:25.757
<i>for a dark-skinned girl."</i>

49:25.882 --> 49:28.509
<i>And I'm like, "What is</i>
<i>that supposed to mean?"</i>

49:28.635 --> 49:32.305
<i>I used to wish that I can</i>
<i>wake up one day lighter,</i>

49:32.430 --> 49:34.682
<i>or wash my face and think</i>
<i>that it would change.</i>

49:34.808 --> 49:37.310
<i>I thought it was dirt.</i>

51:41.642 --> 51:44.311
Comfy shoes, too much, baby.

51:44.437 --> 51:46.439
Who has shoes?

51:49.275 --> 51:53.487
Tish has got some shoes.

51:56.699 --> 51:57.700
Yes!

51:59.285 --> 52:00.703
Okay.

52:02.413 --> 52:03.873
Oh, yeah.

52:03.998 --> 52:05.332
Oh, I'm getting
some ass in these.

52:05.458 --> 52:07.585
Okay.

53:02.066 --> 53:03.025
<i>Hey.</i>

53:03.150 --> 53:04.343
What are you doing?

53:04.437 --> 53:05.730
Finally eating, girl.

53:05.855 --> 53:07.649
Ask me what I'm doing.

53:07.774 --> 53:09.525
What are you doing?

53:09.651 --> 53:11.402
Going out to dinner with David.

53:11.527 --> 53:13.321
<i>It's almost midnight.</i>

53:13.446 --> 53:15.323
You do know this is
a booty call, right?

53:15.448 --> 53:16.658
Yes.

53:16.783 --> 53:17.617
Did you masturbate?

53:17.742 --> 53:18.618
<i>Yes.</i>

53:18.743 --> 53:21.329
Twice, girl.

53:21.454 --> 53:22.538
Good girl.

53:22.664 --> 53:25.041
Now you can talk to
him with a clear head.

53:25.165 --> 53:26.918
And hopefully, you won't
give him any.

53:27.043 --> 53:28.544
Did you give John some?

53:29.712 --> 53:31.756
Turd waits till we're divorced

53:31.881 --> 53:34.342
to help the boys
with their homework.

53:34.467 --> 53:35.760
Was it that sexy?

53:35.885 --> 53:37.595
You'll see one day.

53:37.720 --> 53:38.847
Will I?

53:38.972 --> 53:41.557
Oh, sad Susie, stop it.

53:41.683 --> 53:42.934
Be happy we live in a time

53:43.059 --> 53:44.393
where men take little blue pills

53:44.519 --> 53:46.270
and women can freeze their eggs.

53:46.395 --> 53:49.647
- So are you guys getting back together?
- No.

53:50.066 --> 53:53.277
He wanted to talk
about some tax stuff.

53:53.402 --> 53:56.948
Looks like we're gonna take a
bigger hit than we expected.

53:57.073 --> 53:58.793
But you can hear about
my problems tomorrow.

53:58.825 --> 54:00.618
You go to dinner with David.

54:00.743 --> 54:02.537
All right, bye.

54:02.662 --> 54:04.873
Good night.

54:26.936 --> 54:29.981
Call "Never Answer."

54:30.106 --> 54:32.650
<i>Dialing "Never Answer."</i>

54:34.610 --> 54:36.529
Hello?

54:36.654 --> 54:39.699
Hey, um...

54:39.824 --> 54:41.576
You know, there's not
enough chicken and waffles

54:41.701 --> 54:43.870
I could order to make this
something that it isn't.

54:43.995 --> 54:47.415
And, you know, we're...

54:47.540 --> 54:51.002
we're grown, so how
about we let a booty call

54:51.127 --> 54:55.673
be a booty call, and dinner be,

54:55.798 --> 54:58.927
I don't know, some
thought and planning

54:59.052 --> 55:01.888
and at least a day's notice.

55:05.683 --> 55:07.685
Okay, Mary Jane.

55:10.521 --> 55:11.647
Good night, David.

55:11.773 --> 55:12.523
<i>Good night.</i>

55:35.922 --> 55:36.756
Oh my God.

55:45.181 --> 55:48.350
Oh my gosh.

55:48.476 --> 55:52.063
Auntie, thank you so much.

55:52.188 --> 55:54.356
It's exactly what I wanted.

55:54.482 --> 55:55.566
Thank you.

55:55.691 --> 55:57.811
Everybody, give it up for my
auntie, she hooked me up.

56:00.613 --> 56:02.364
Oh my gosh, let's see.

56:40.528 --> 56:41.779
Dante, yo.

56:41.904 --> 56:43.781
Hey, super sperm.

56:43.906 --> 56:45.533
Yeah, what?

56:45.658 --> 56:47.618
Please tell me there's a job

56:47.743 --> 56:50.496
somewhere in the middle of
all this unprotected sex.

56:50.621 --> 56:52.707
Look, I love Niecy,
and I'm gonna be there

56:52.832 --> 56:55.960
for our baby, so just relax.

56:56.085 --> 56:58.546
How much does love pay, exactly?

57:10.558 --> 57:11.475
You can come in.

57:13.811 --> 57:16.522
I'll wait.

57:16.647 --> 57:18.649
Here.

57:21.069 --> 57:22.486
No, I'm good.

57:22.611 --> 57:23.696
Just take it.

57:23.821 --> 57:27.116
Daddy, look what I got.

57:27.242 --> 57:30.516
It's the stroller we talked about.
Auntie really hooked me up.

57:30.828 --> 57:33.873
Yeah.

57:33.998 --> 57:36.751
That's nice, baby.

57:42.131 --> 57:45.051
I don't need it anymore.

58:18.084 --> 58:18.918
What do you want?

58:19.043 --> 58:21.170
I'm sorry.

58:21.296 --> 58:25.091
- You gotta open the door,
I can't hear you.
- What do you want?

58:25.216 --> 58:27.051
Yeah, yeah, again, I...
I can't hear you.

58:27.176 --> 58:29.304
You gotta open the door.

58:36.185 --> 58:37.895
So, I was thinking
about what you said

58:38.020 --> 58:39.939
the other night, about
us being grown

58:40.064 --> 58:42.275
and how we should just let
things be what they are.

58:44.444 --> 58:46.528
I was wondering if
you might be up

58:46.654 --> 58:48.739
for some consensual sex.

58:50.866 --> 58:51.617
Oh, and snacks.

59:02.962 --> 59:04.172
It's good to see you.

59:04.297 --> 59:06.882
Good to see you.

59:10.845 --> 59:13.639
Say, brother, a booty call
means you take your ass home.

59:14.890 --> 59:17.935
All right, all right,
I'm going, I'm going.

59:18.060 --> 59:21.563
I feel so used.

59:21.689 --> 59:22.815
Right.

59:22.940 --> 59:26.027
Hey.
Huh?

59:26.152 --> 59:28.737
What kind of detergent you use?

59:28.863 --> 59:30.281
I've been trying to
find it since...

59:30.406 --> 59:33.117
It's my own mix, you're not
gonna be able to find it.

59:33.242 --> 59:36.204
Oh, secrets.

59:38.206 --> 59:40.582
Um...

59:40.708 --> 59:42.029
I'm also having
trouble finding...

59:42.126 --> 59:44.128
Yeah, no, I, uh,
I took care of it.

59:44.253 --> 59:45.796
Oh.

59:45.921 --> 59:48.674
All right, cool.

59:48.799 --> 59:50.385
Yep.

59:50.510 --> 59:54.555
He made me so many promises,
and I hung in there,

59:54.680 --> 59:57.350
waiting for him to marry me
so we could start our family,

59:57.475 --> 59:59.768
you know, the way you're
supposed to.

59:59.894 --> 01:00:01.187
And although I
held onto the hope

01:00:01.312 --> 01:00:03.605
of one day being married,
I was running out of time

01:00:03.731 --> 01:00:06.817
to have the children
I've always wanted.

01:00:06.942 --> 01:00:10.363
So you stole the sperm.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.783
When we broke up, he took the TV

01:00:14.909 --> 01:00:18.704
and seven great
years of my life.

01:00:18.829 --> 01:00:20.498
I took the sperm.

01:00:20.622 --> 01:00:22.250
Well, I don't know
if stealing semen

01:00:22.375 --> 01:00:25.169
is an epidemic, but it's certainly
a sign of our changing times.

01:00:25.294 --> 01:00:28.089
As Deepak Chopra said,

01:00:28.214 --> 01:00:30.132
"All great changes are
preceded by chaos."

01:00:30.258 --> 01:00:32.927
I'm Mary Jane Paul.

01:00:33.052 --> 01:00:35.274
Thanks for listening.
