01:07.495 --> 01:08.989
Hello, folks at home.

01:10.581 --> 01:12.538
I'm 100 yards from the top of Mt. Everest.

01:12.625 --> 01:16.290
Yet there's a part of me
that can't wait to end this silly vacation...

01:16.378 --> 01:19.712
...and get back to work,
where the real challenges await.

01:20.883 --> 01:23.421
Shouldn't you take your age
into consideration, sir?

01:23.511 --> 01:25.550
After all, you're 82 years old.

01:25.805 --> 01:27.215
Am I 82?

01:27.389 --> 01:31.339
These numbers mean nothing to me.
My journey through life has just begun.

01:31.435 --> 01:32.894
Sir! Sir!

01:33.229 --> 01:36.146
-Oota tells me the storm's getting worse.
-Very, very bad.

01:36.232 --> 01:39.351
We must abandon our ascent and
go down the mountain immediately.

01:39.443 --> 01:42.480
We're so very close to the top,
Mr. Puffy Jacket Man.

01:43.114 --> 01:46.529
I'm heading down now, sir.
I advise you to do the same.

01:46.617 --> 01:48.111
All right, so be it.

01:48.202 --> 01:52.282
See you at the staff meeting on Monday.
And I'll bring the Krispy Kremes!

02:11.015 --> 02:14.599
There, once again, the sad footage
we've been watching all day.

02:14.728 --> 02:19.141
A beloved visionary who turned a single
radio station into a global media empire...

02:19.233 --> 02:22.732
...Preston Blake, dead at 82. More after this.

02:27.032 --> 02:29.321
You're watching
the Blake Broadcasting Network.

02:29.410 --> 02:32.115
The stock of Blake Media,
the parent company of this network...

02:32.204 --> 02:34.778
...plunged this morning
on the news of Blake's death...

02:34.874 --> 02:39.002
...but bounced back after a statement by
Blake's long-time number 2, Chuck Cedar.

02:39.086 --> 02:41.375
All the king's horses
and all the king's men...

02:41.464 --> 02:44.879
...couldn't save Preston Blake
from becoming a human Popsicle.

02:44.967 --> 02:49.795
And sources indicate that Blake, who was
single and had no children, left no will.

02:50.598 --> 02:54.049
So who inherits Blake's 49 percent stake
in the company's stock...

02:54.143 --> 02:56.266
...valued at $40 billion?

02:56.604 --> 03:00.933
We'll discuss that with people close
to Blake, including his long-time barber...

03:01.025 --> 03:04.939
...on tomorrow's Inside Access.
Until then, I'm Mac McGrath.

03:07.031 --> 03:08.905
-Are we clear?
-Clear!

03:09.200 --> 03:11.525
Babe? Where's Babe?

03:11.869 --> 03:14.538
-I'll come over and choke you to death.
-Babe!

03:14.622 --> 03:15.487
I got to go.

03:15.581 --> 03:18.072
Freaking barber!
That's the best you could get me?

03:18.167 --> 03:20.836
People tell everything to their barbers.

03:21.003 --> 03:24.372
He's been his closest confidant
for more than 20 years.

03:24.465 --> 03:28.379
I'm not putting this guy on the air.
Get me something better and get it quick.

03:28.469 --> 03:29.928
Or it's your ass.

03:34.391 --> 03:36.183
Did we find this heir yet?

03:36.268 --> 03:39.305
We should be getting that information
via fax any minute now.

03:39.396 --> 03:41.638
I have lawyers
looking through birth records...

03:41.732 --> 03:44.519
...in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and Guam.

03:44.610 --> 03:49.106
In fact, we have a little pool going.
Guam's paying off at 1000-1.

03:49.782 --> 03:51.406
Is this a joke to you?

03:52.368 --> 03:55.867
Some genetic lottery winner
now controls the fate of this company.

03:55.955 --> 03:58.528
No, I agree. It's troubling.

03:58.624 --> 04:01.329
Troubling? Your beard is troubling.

04:01.794 --> 04:06.005
Your pipe is troubling.
Your yellow teeth are really troubling.

04:06.215 --> 04:09.880
But if I lose control of this company,
it'll be catastrophic.

04:15.766 --> 04:18.339
Does anyone know a Dr. Mendlesohn?

04:19.310 --> 04:21.885
Congratulations, you have a spastic colon.

04:22.898 --> 04:25.105
That would explain a lot.

04:40.082 --> 04:41.660
"Longfellow Deeds."

04:48.048 --> 04:50.670
Chuck, I think we're there.

04:52.595 --> 04:54.303
My God, it's all green.

05:00.060 --> 05:03.844
Look at that thing.
Fighter pilot on your left.

05:05.566 --> 05:06.894
Got that sucker!

05:21.916 --> 05:23.114
You guys lost?

05:23.209 --> 05:25.996
We're looking for somebody:
Longfellow Deeds.

05:26.295 --> 05:28.584
Is that Deeds' first name?

05:28.672 --> 05:31.342
If the Deeds you're referring to
is Longfellow Deeds...

05:31.425 --> 05:33.797
...then yes, that is Deeds' first name.

05:33.886 --> 05:36.803
I don't know Deeds' first name.
Maybe it's Greg.

05:37.139 --> 05:39.262
-Maybe it's Longfellow.
-Maybe.

05:39.350 --> 05:43.015
But I don't know. I know another guy
named Greg. You want me to call him?

05:43.103 --> 05:46.270
No! Thank you.
Please, just tell us where Deeds lives.

05:46.398 --> 05:50.313
All right, don't get all hyperactive.
I'll take you straight to him.

05:56.575 --> 05:58.235
Step right in, fellows.

06:01.539 --> 06:04.539
-He lives at a pizzeria?
-You can't live in a pizzeria.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.748
He lives upstairs. He owns it.

06:06.836 --> 06:09.124
Excuse me. Is Mr. Deeds around?

06:09.213 --> 06:13.839
No, I'm sorry, he's out making deliveries.
The regular delivery guy called in sick.

06:14.009 --> 06:18.921
-But you don't look too sick, Murph.
-I forgot I was faking sick today.

06:19.932 --> 06:24.558
-You two tricked me into coming here.
-Put on an apron and give me a hand.

06:24.979 --> 06:28.098
You guys played me like a fiddle. Touche!

06:29.150 --> 06:31.023
Is Mrs. Deeds around?

06:31.110 --> 06:34.313
Mrs. Deeds?
I don't think that poor boy ever had a date.

06:34.530 --> 06:38.444
-Do you know when he'll be back?
-Before lunch is out. Today's Card Day.

06:38.534 --> 06:40.610
-Card Day?
-Deeds writes greeting cards.

06:40.703 --> 06:43.869
Every Monday, he tries out a few
and then he chooses one...

06:43.956 --> 06:46.447
...and sends it
to one of the big card companies.

06:46.542 --> 06:48.867
Now, he hasn't sold any yet, but...

06:49.170 --> 06:50.368
...he will.

06:51.547 --> 06:53.705
You guys need anything else here?

06:53.841 --> 06:55.300
"To my sweetheart

06:56.343 --> 06:59.013
"I love you completely, with all my soul

06:59.221 --> 07:02.258
"Without you I'm nothing, a butterless roll"

07:03.726 --> 07:05.006
That's good.

07:05.102 --> 07:06.680
Like that, gentlemen?

07:07.688 --> 07:10.523
Hallmark said it showed potential,
which is pretty cool.

07:10.608 --> 07:12.896
-Longfellow Deeds?
-Just call me Deeds, pal.

07:12.985 --> 07:15.061
Easy with that Longfellow stuff.

07:15.321 --> 07:16.779
Chuck Cedar, CEO.

07:16.864 --> 07:19.699
Cecil Anderson,
General Counsel of Blake Media.

07:19.783 --> 07:22.701
Handshakes are for strangers.
We hug around here, buddy.

07:22.786 --> 07:24.909
What's up? Welcome to town.

07:26.081 --> 07:28.039
Come on, don't be shy.

07:28.792 --> 07:32.244
I like that beard. Abe Lincoln-style.
Have a seat, boys.

07:32.421 --> 07:33.666
-Murph!
-Deeds?

07:33.756 --> 07:36.673
-I thought you were sick today.
-That was a lie, pal.

07:36.759 --> 07:38.170
You fooled me.

07:38.260 --> 07:39.375
-I did?
-Yeah.

07:39.470 --> 07:41.427
-Mr. Deeds?
-Just Deeds.

07:41.847 --> 07:45.596
You sounded so sick on the phone.
You're good. Do that sick voice again.

07:45.684 --> 07:49.634
Deeds, I can't come to work today.
I think I got strep throat.

07:53.108 --> 07:56.524
That's unbelievable.
You could be a radio actor or something.

07:56.612 --> 07:58.901
-Thanks, buddy.
-Sure.

07:59.114 --> 08:02.566
Hey, Deeds. Read a card already.
I got to get back on duty.

08:03.702 --> 08:06.193
I'd better get up there.
Good meeting you, gentlemen.

08:06.288 --> 08:09.373
Mr. Deeds, does the name Preston Blake
mean anything to you?

08:09.458 --> 08:11.451
Mom's maiden name was Blake.

08:11.794 --> 08:16.290
Only one this week, but I got a feeling
it'll end my losing streak with Hallmark.

08:18.217 --> 08:20.459
Preston Blake was your mother's uncle.

08:20.553 --> 08:23.554
You're kidding me, I got an uncle?
Awesome. How's he doing?

08:23.639 --> 08:24.837
He's dead.

08:25.307 --> 08:27.596
Oh, no. If there's anything I can do...

08:27.685 --> 08:29.393
Deeds! Deeds!

08:30.062 --> 08:31.971
I'll be right with you guys.

08:33.232 --> 08:35.852
When Mr. Blake died,
he left an enormous fortune.

08:35.943 --> 08:38.648
$40 billion. He left it all...

08:39.238 --> 08:40.649
...to you, Deeds.

08:42.991 --> 08:44.534
Wait a minute.

08:45.494 --> 08:49.326
What are you talking about, you got
to get back on duty? You're not a cop.

08:49.415 --> 08:52.036
You're right.
I got this down at the costume shop.

08:52.126 --> 08:54.083
But it can't hurt to pretend.

08:55.045 --> 08:56.705
What a wisenheimer!

08:56.839 --> 08:58.831
Okay, everybody, it's show time.

09:00.676 --> 09:02.918
I call this "50th Anniversary Card."

09:03.512 --> 09:05.552
Which is quite a feat nowadays.

09:06.056 --> 09:09.805
"Fifty years have passed by
with laughter and tears

09:10.519 --> 09:12.726
"Do you remember when we went to the zoo

09:12.813 --> 09:15.185
"and that time we drank all the beers?"

09:15.941 --> 09:16.937
Beers!

09:18.527 --> 09:21.979
"I promise to love you for 50 years more

09:22.490 --> 09:25.823
"Even when your bosoms
sag down to the floor"

09:27.453 --> 09:30.122
That was awesome! How's he do it?

09:33.542 --> 09:36.828
It looks like you won't have
to deliver pizza anymore, Deeds.

09:36.921 --> 09:38.581
You're a very rich man.

09:38.839 --> 09:41.461
What's that got to do with delivering pizzas?

09:41.550 --> 09:43.958
Ladies! The top one is yours.

09:44.053 --> 09:46.045
-Thank you, Deeds.
-Of course.

09:46.138 --> 09:48.131
-Yummy!
-So, Deeds, what's new?

09:48.766 --> 09:51.387
I found out I have an uncle, but he died.

09:51.727 --> 09:53.008
That's too bad.

09:53.270 --> 09:56.722
-He gave me $40 billion, though.
-Well, that's nice.

09:56.899 --> 09:57.812
Oh, yeah!

09:57.900 --> 10:01.233
Don't you go and spend it all
on some fancy record player.

10:01.487 --> 10:02.566
I won't.

10:02.655 --> 10:04.232
Who are your friends, Deeds?

10:04.323 --> 10:08.736
I'm sorry.
Chuck, Cecil, this is Jane, Kitty and Sue.

10:09.203 --> 10:13.117
-Pleasure to meet you, Cecil.
-Pleasure's all mine, Kitty.

10:13.541 --> 10:16.114
Or should I just say, "Meow"?

10:18.254 --> 10:20.293
Keep it in your pants, Anderson.

10:21.590 --> 10:26.133
-Now, why am I inheriting this money?
-You're Mr. Blake's closest living relative.

10:26.428 --> 10:29.180
-Really? He had nobody else?
-Nope, that's it.

10:29.265 --> 10:31.304
Gosh, I never even met the guy.

10:34.186 --> 10:36.345
Would you hold this for a second?

10:37.481 --> 10:39.688
Mr. Wetherley. How you doing, pal?

10:39.900 --> 10:42.937
Very well, Deeds.
Just going to the pharmacy.

10:43.028 --> 10:45.698
Well, let me get you there a little quicker.

10:48.576 --> 10:50.699
-How's your wife?
-She's fine.

10:50.786 --> 10:53.242
-Terrific. Say hi for me.
-I will.

10:53.330 --> 10:54.825
Okay. Here you go.

10:56.041 --> 10:58.793
-Thanks for the lift, Deeds.
-You got it.

11:01.714 --> 11:05.628
We need you to come back to New York
with us. Just for a few days.

11:05.718 --> 11:08.125
We're drawing up some papers
you'll need to sign.

11:08.220 --> 11:09.714
What kind of papers?

11:09.805 --> 11:14.301
Technically, you've inherited
300 million shares of Blake Media, Inc.

11:14.393 --> 11:17.809
Chuck and l, along with
some of the partners, will buy that stock...

11:17.897 --> 11:21.147
...for $40 billion,
which we've had to borrow from various...

11:21.233 --> 11:23.392
Who cares about
the financial mumbo jumbo?

11:23.486 --> 11:26.321
We need a little time
to dot the t's and cross the i's.

11:26.405 --> 11:29.739
And while we're doing that,
we need you to stay away from the press.

11:29.825 --> 11:33.111
The media frenzy will die down
in a couple weeks but until then...

11:33.204 --> 11:37.284
You don't want reporters crawling
all over this lovely little town, do you?

11:37.374 --> 11:38.370
Oh, no!

11:41.420 --> 11:43.662
-Crazy Eyes!
-What?

11:46.675 --> 11:50.210
How you doing, pal?
I got your pizza, just the way you like it.

11:50.304 --> 11:51.300
Oh, yes!

11:52.473 --> 11:55.676
French fries and Oreos.
You know me all too well, Deeds.

11:55.893 --> 11:57.138
What are you in for?

11:57.228 --> 11:59.932
I'm doing a one-nighter
for biting Ed the mailman.

12:00.022 --> 12:03.521
The guy was trying to cast a spell on me,
like a wizard.

12:04.652 --> 12:08.484
-Are you sure about that?
-I don't know. Maybe he was just waving.

12:10.032 --> 12:13.567
-Who are your friends?
-This is Chuck and Cecil from New York.

12:15.037 --> 12:16.496
I don't like them.

12:17.289 --> 12:18.997
Okay. Nice seeing you.

12:19.875 --> 12:23.624
I've never been to New York before.
I suppose I could check out the sights.

12:23.712 --> 12:26.001
-Give me an hour to pack, okay?
-You got it.

12:26.090 --> 12:30.004
I'll be the first guy to leave here since
Jimmy McNally went to Disney World.

12:32.555 --> 12:34.298
See you later, everybody!

12:37.351 --> 12:41.100
Tomorrow is "Kids Eat For Free" Day.
Don't forget to clean the highchairs.

12:41.188 --> 12:43.560
Don't worry, I'll take care of everything.

12:43.649 --> 12:45.807
-Go, have a good time!
-I'll miss you.

12:45.901 --> 12:48.108
'Bye, Jan. Smell you later, Murph.

12:49.864 --> 12:51.488
-Give us a card!
-Yeah!

12:54.160 --> 12:57.908
"On my way to the big city
for a business trip

12:58.414 --> 13:02.708
"Never, ever left Mandrake Falls before
Ain't that a pip?

13:05.463 --> 13:09.211
"But while I'm gone
I know I'll miss you all a lot"

13:09.675 --> 13:13.589
"So bring your rich butt back here
and buy us all a shot"

13:15.431 --> 13:16.925
You got it, pal!

13:21.437 --> 13:22.848
Take it easy.

13:31.447 --> 13:35.445
The biggest story of the year
and we've got nothing?

13:36.035 --> 13:39.867
Do you want to be tabloid journalists?
Because I don't think so.

13:39.955 --> 13:42.790
You've got to be ruthless.
When I started out...

13:42.875 --> 13:45.746
...I slept in Tom and Roseanne's dumpster
for two days...

13:45.836 --> 13:49.039
-...disguised as a giant carton of ice cream.
-I got it!

13:49.381 --> 13:51.754
My source at Blake says
the company helicopter...

13:51.842 --> 13:55.377
...took off from there this afternoon
with two male passengers aboard...

13:55.471 --> 13:57.428
-...headed for Mandrake Falls.
-Where?

13:57.515 --> 13:59.803
Some little hick-ass town in New Hampshire.

13:59.892 --> 14:03.724
But now they're on their way back
with three male passengers.

14:04.438 --> 14:06.431
-That's one more!
-Duh!

14:07.316 --> 14:10.103
That third guy's our heir. Nice work, Marty.

14:10.194 --> 14:12.767
They were supposed to arrive
at Blake Media at 5:00.

14:12.863 --> 14:15.568
But they made an unscheduled stop
in Connecticut.

14:15.658 --> 14:18.030
I'm so happy I got the Big Bacon Classic.

14:18.119 --> 14:20.325
Thanks for stopping. This is unbelievable.

14:20.412 --> 14:23.616
-Happy to do it.
-How's that Frosty treating you, Cecil?

14:24.125 --> 14:27.375
You got some on your beard.
I'm just kidding.

14:27.461 --> 14:29.169
I got him big time, man.

14:30.047 --> 14:32.503
I'm going on the air in two hours' time.

14:32.591 --> 14:36.375
And I want that guy's life story by then.
I'm talking to you, Jim.

14:36.846 --> 14:39.383
And I'm also talking to you, Babe. Babe?

14:40.307 --> 14:41.932
Where the hell's Babe?

14:42.017 --> 14:44.769
You missed another staff meeting.
Mac's pissed.

14:44.854 --> 14:48.223
He won't be pissed
when I crack this Blake story.

14:48.315 --> 14:51.519
-What do you got?
-Nothing. Do you have anything?

14:51.777 --> 14:53.734
I'll have a lot more in a few hours.

14:53.821 --> 14:55.232
You got to be a pal.

14:55.322 --> 14:58.905
I need this story.
I'm flat broke and Mac is going to fire me.

14:58.993 --> 15:01.994
How're you flat broke?
You make more money than anyone here.

15:02.079 --> 15:04.155
-What did you blow it on?
-Shoes.

15:04.248 --> 15:06.821
I'll tell you everything I know
over lunch tomorrow...

15:06.917 --> 15:09.040
...as long as your club promoter boyfriend...

15:09.128 --> 15:11.833
...doesn't try to run me over
with his motorcycle again.

15:11.922 --> 15:15.754
You're safe there.
Ken and I are kind of taking a break.

15:15.843 --> 15:17.586
Really? So he moved out?

15:18.929 --> 15:22.096
Babe, what are you staying here for?
I have a spare bedroom.

15:22.183 --> 15:24.341
We tried that once, remember?

15:24.435 --> 15:28.598
I woke up and you were standing
over my bed, breathing heavily.

15:28.689 --> 15:31.975
I was having an asthma attack.
I couldn't find my puffer.

15:34.778 --> 15:39.191
Easy, fellows.
The Biggie Fries are making a comeback.

15:39.825 --> 15:43.953
You guys football fans? The Pats
could take the conference this year.

15:44.038 --> 15:47.039
The Dolphins are overrated
and the Jets are choke artists.

15:47.124 --> 15:48.784
I wouldn't say that, Mr. Deeds.

15:48.876 --> 15:52.245
-Just Deeds. Why is that, though?
-You own the Jets, Deeds.

15:52.338 --> 15:53.666
I do?

15:55.883 --> 15:57.046
That sucks.

15:58.135 --> 16:02.464
I hope they don't play the Pats
in the playoffs or I'll have to kill myself.

16:04.266 --> 16:06.638
I'm still very worried about this.

16:07.394 --> 16:10.977
What do you got in that pipe, hashish?
You're paranoid.

16:11.232 --> 16:14.435
-This guy's perfect for us.
-What if he won't sell us his shares?

16:14.527 --> 16:16.852
If I got Blake to trust me with his company...

16:16.946 --> 16:17.822
...I can get this moron to do the same.
Look at him.

16:17.822 --> 16:19.779
...I can get this moron to do the same.
Look at him.

16:45.558 --> 16:47.135
That's right, Anderson.

17:01.448 --> 17:02.991
Enough!

17:04.451 --> 17:05.696
Party pooper.

17:10.249 --> 17:11.660
Holy cow!

17:12.126 --> 17:13.750
What's up, New York?

17:14.377 --> 17:18.376
It's an honour to come
to the greatest city in the world!

17:25.763 --> 17:30.723
Congratulations, Deeds, you're now
the most eligible bachelor in New York.

17:30.978 --> 17:33.765
I don't want to meet a girl
just because I'm wicked rich.

17:33.856 --> 17:36.525
That's nice, but let's see
how you stick to your guns...

17:36.609 --> 17:40.191
...once you've paid a visit to one
of our many fine gentlemen's clubs.

17:40.279 --> 17:41.192
What?

17:41.614 --> 17:43.405
My father saved my mother.

17:43.490 --> 17:46.112
She was figure skating
and fell through the ice.

17:46.202 --> 17:49.986
I always thought I'd meet
a girl the same way. Bullspit like that.

17:50.080 --> 17:53.746
Then I'll just keep a lookout
for ladies in distress, as it were.

17:53.834 --> 17:56.159
-That'd be nice.
-Hey, Mandrake Falls!

17:57.421 --> 17:59.129
Security, stop that guy!

17:59.965 --> 18:01.045
Stop! Come back!

18:01.133 --> 18:04.467
He'll get $100,000 for the picture.
It'll be on the news in an hour.

18:04.553 --> 18:07.471
He deserves it with those
James Bond moves he just pulled.

18:07.556 --> 18:11.720
No, he deserves to get his throat cut,
the filthy spy. Come on, let's go.

18:18.943 --> 18:20.651
So this is where my uncle lived?

18:20.736 --> 18:24.319
Yes, sir. For the last 35 years
of his astonishing life.

18:24.698 --> 18:28.317
-You kind of snuck up on me there.
-I am very, very sneaky, sir.

18:28.536 --> 18:30.991
I see that. My name is Deeds.

18:31.121 --> 18:33.529
I am Emilio, sir. I am your servant.

18:33.874 --> 18:38.417
Servant? I don't want a servant,
but if you want to be my friend, I'll take that.

18:39.046 --> 18:40.161
Friends.

18:40.714 --> 18:42.790
Yes, good friends.

18:43.801 --> 18:48.344
Would you like to go to your apartment?
I'm sure it's been an exhausting day.

18:48.472 --> 18:50.928
-That okay with you, Chuck?
-You'll be safe there.

18:51.016 --> 18:54.266
It'll take us a couple days
to draw up the papers for you to sign.

18:54.353 --> 18:56.393
-Go make yourself at home.
-Terrific.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.639
-Later.
-I will be with you shortly, sir.

18:58.732 --> 19:01.852
You got it. Nice to meet you. I'm Deeds.

19:02.736 --> 19:05.441
-I'm Reuben, sir.
-This is a wicked nice elevator.

19:05.531 --> 19:08.697
Keep an eye on him, Emilio.
Or it's your ass.

19:08.826 --> 19:10.617
It's nice to see you too, sir.

19:10.703 --> 19:13.276
So how's the elevator business
treating you, Reuben?

19:13.372 --> 19:15.281
It has its ups and downs.

19:15.708 --> 19:17.831
All right! All right!

19:18.752 --> 19:20.033
That was good.

19:21.130 --> 19:23.455
Jeesum crow,
how'd you get down here so fast?

19:23.549 --> 19:26.301
Sneaky-sneaky, sir. Right this way.

19:30.097 --> 19:31.093
Wow.

19:34.351 --> 19:35.680
Wow.

19:37.438 --> 19:39.395
Is something the matter, sir?

19:41.859 --> 19:44.314
-That's an echo, sir.
-Yeah, you try it.

19:44.820 --> 19:46.860
-Me, sir?
-lt's a lot of fun.

19:51.869 --> 19:54.360
Come on, you can do it louder than that.

20:02.463 --> 20:04.254
-Serious.
-Thank you, sir.

20:04.507 --> 20:07.626
Hey, buddy, how you doing?
You want to give it a shot?

20:09.762 --> 20:10.675
Nice.

20:13.098 --> 20:15.850
You guys want to join us?
Make a weird noise.

20:24.610 --> 20:28.359
That was a great time. Well, I'm tired.
I'd like to go to sleep.

20:28.531 --> 20:31.448
-This way.
-Thank you very much. Good night.

20:31.534 --> 20:32.732
Good night.

20:41.293 --> 20:44.793
You just going to lie there
and let the Post take your story?

20:58.394 --> 21:00.054
What's up, New York?

21:11.115 --> 21:11.532
He had a water fountain in his room.
I love it.

21:11.532 --> 21:14.070
He had a water fountain in his room.
I love it.

21:22.543 --> 21:24.203
That's Hawaiian Punch.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.249
He adored...

21:26.422 --> 21:27.833
...Hawaiian Punch.

21:27.923 --> 21:31.968
Wow! You kind of just snuck up on me.

21:32.553 --> 21:35.803
I fear you're underestimating
the sneakiness.

21:36.015 --> 21:38.719
I guess I was.
What are you doing down there?

21:38.976 --> 21:41.514
I am assisting you with your sock change.

21:41.604 --> 21:44.854
You'd change my socks for me?
You don't got to do that. Stand up.

21:44.940 --> 21:45.722
Thank you.

21:45.816 --> 21:48.603
Besides, you don't want
to have to touch my right foot.

21:48.694 --> 21:52.478
I got wicked bad frostbite when I was
in the Scouts. Check it out.

21:57.786 --> 21:59.329
Pretty messed up, huh?

21:59.413 --> 22:03.707
The hideousness of that foot
will haunt my dreams forever.

22:04.501 --> 22:06.375
Yeah, I've heard that before.

22:06.462 --> 22:09.379
But the weird thing is
I got no feeling left in it.

22:09.465 --> 22:12.335
So you could jump on it
and it wouldn't hurt me.

22:12.510 --> 22:15.676
-Go ahead, jump on it.
-I'd really rather not, sir.

22:15.763 --> 22:17.471
Please jump on my foot.

22:27.900 --> 22:29.228
I didn't feel that.

22:29.318 --> 22:33.398
What else you got? Get that
fireplace poker and whack my foot.

22:33.739 --> 22:37.357
-Do I absolutely have to?
-lt's going to be fun. Just grab it.

22:39.036 --> 22:41.907
All my friends do this when they're wasted.

22:42.331 --> 22:43.327
Come on.

22:44.583 --> 22:46.375
Go ahead, give it a whack.

22:49.755 --> 22:51.036
-Nothing.
-Really?

22:51.131 --> 22:52.507
Isn't that sick?

22:54.009 --> 22:56.417
Didn't feel that. Isn't that awesome?
Go ahead.

22:56.512 --> 22:57.508
Nothing.

22:58.264 --> 23:01.798
You're starting to like it, aren't you?
Chop that wood!

23:02.184 --> 23:03.465
That's it!

23:05.187 --> 23:08.556
You're sick! You're sick!
Why would you do that?

23:08.649 --> 23:10.558
I'm just kidding you, pal.

23:11.902 --> 23:15.567
-You had me going there.
-I saw your face, you were like...

23:17.283 --> 23:20.983
I got to find out from Cedar and Anderson
what I'm supposed to do today.

23:21.078 --> 23:24.696
So could you take that out of my foot?
I'm nailed to the ground.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.072
There you go.

23:26.709 --> 23:30.042
I must insist on absolute secrecy
regarding this discussion...

23:30.129 --> 23:32.702
...till I've officially acquired
Mr. Blake's shares.

23:32.798 --> 23:35.289
If that's acceptable,
then as far as I'm concerned...

23:35.384 --> 23:38.005
...you've just bought 2,000 radio stations.

23:39.180 --> 23:40.425
Good morning.

23:41.765 --> 23:42.761
Deeds.

23:43.184 --> 23:44.298
What's up?

23:44.810 --> 23:46.518
Doing a little business.

23:49.607 --> 23:53.390
This room's an echo room, too.
I'm sure you guys already knew that.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.351
May I help you?

23:55.446 --> 23:58.815
I just wanted to see
if there's anything I should do today.

23:59.825 --> 24:02.067
I think we've got everything under control.

24:02.161 --> 24:06.787
There's got to be something. Until I sign
those papers I own this place, right?

24:08.334 --> 24:09.496
What?

24:10.002 --> 24:12.410
Ladies and gentlemen,
pardon me a moment, please.

24:12.505 --> 24:13.584
Of course.

24:13.672 --> 24:17.373
What's up, buddy? I was dreaming
about Frosties all last night. You?

24:17.468 --> 24:20.635
I tried to make my own at home,
but it wasn't the same.

24:21.847 --> 24:22.629
Deeds.

24:22.723 --> 24:26.673
Every stockholder, large and small,
has a say in the operation of this company.

24:26.769 --> 24:29.390
They have this say
at the annual stockholders' meeting.

24:29.480 --> 24:33.098
The other 364 days of the year,
the officers of the company, like me...

24:33.192 --> 24:35.944
-...run the show.
-You mean now that my uncle's gone.

24:36.028 --> 24:38.353
Yeah, and it's not all fun and games.

24:38.697 --> 24:41.948
This company is a player on so many levels
and in so many areas...

24:42.034 --> 24:45.284
...that running it is literally
a 24-hour-a-day job.

24:45.871 --> 24:48.541
I only got three hours of sleep last night.

24:48.874 --> 24:51.544
Then it's actually a 21-hour-a-day job, huh?

24:51.877 --> 24:54.878
Move it, lady.
I don't give a damn about no meeting.

24:54.964 --> 24:56.672
Mr. Cedar, I am sorry...

24:56.882 --> 25:01.260
I passed for 3,500 yards last season
and I ain't gonna touch a football...

25:01.345 --> 25:05.888
...until you get off your fat, rich asses
and renegotiate my bullshit contract.

25:06.892 --> 25:10.095
Easy with the language, buddy.
There are ladies present.

25:10.896 --> 25:13.268
Shut the hell up, rich boy!

25:13.941 --> 25:17.476
I want more money,
or you all can just suck my...

25:21.991 --> 25:23.236
I warned you.

25:24.618 --> 25:28.698
You went down like a sack of potatoes,
I'll tell you that much. Come on.

25:30.082 --> 25:32.454
Come on, big man. Upsy-daisy.

25:32.626 --> 25:35.034
Ladies and gentlemen, football!

25:36.422 --> 25:38.794
What's the problem with your contract?

25:39.383 --> 25:43.381
I figured if I played well,
I'd renegotiate and get more money.

25:43.762 --> 25:46.966
If you didn't play well,
could we renegotiate and pay you less?

25:47.057 --> 25:48.220
Shit, no!

25:48.726 --> 25:50.386
I mean, no.

25:51.437 --> 25:53.513
Doesn't seem fair to me.

25:53.606 --> 25:57.935
-He led the League in touchdown passes.
-That's okay, Chuck. I got this one.

25:58.235 --> 26:00.905
Listen, fellows, I want more money...

26:01.280 --> 26:03.901
...or I ain't even gonna play another down.

26:06.785 --> 26:09.027
Well, we'll have to let you go then.

26:09.914 --> 26:12.749
-Let me go?
-Yeah, you're fired.

26:14.376 --> 26:16.084
So can I sign with another team?

26:16.170 --> 26:19.040
You can do anything.
I suggest you change your attitude...

26:19.131 --> 26:21.622
...or nobody will want to work with you.

26:22.551 --> 26:23.547
'Bye.

26:25.137 --> 26:26.133
Deeds.

26:26.430 --> 26:29.929
Kevin won the Heisman Trophy
two years ago. He is our best player.

26:30.017 --> 26:33.718
-Don't worry, he'll be back.
-Biggest mistake of your lives!

26:34.021 --> 26:35.515
This thing is cool.

26:36.023 --> 26:40.234
Why don't you get out and enjoy the city?
Everything's fine here. Take that with you.

26:40.319 --> 26:43.770
I'll leave it here. That's all right.
But call me if you need me.

26:43.864 --> 26:46.949
-Absolutely.
-Thanks. Love you, Anderson.

26:47.118 --> 26:51.411
All you guys, I noticed you were French.
The opposite of bonjour to you.

26:54.667 --> 26:56.244
You look so hot as a blond.

26:56.335 --> 26:59.252
It's not too streaky?
I feel like he did it really streaky.

26:59.338 --> 27:02.624
I love it, but let me go undercover.
This could get dangerous.

27:02.716 --> 27:06.796
He said he likes ladies in distress,
not men who wear too much cologne.

27:07.054 --> 27:09.296
-There he is.
-Thanks for the tour.

27:09.390 --> 27:12.759
-You're welcome.
-Hidden cameras on, ready? Molest me.

27:13.894 --> 27:15.686
-Molest me!
-You got it!

27:15.771 --> 27:17.764
-God, help!
-Give it to me.

27:17.940 --> 27:19.932
-Help, I'm being mugged!
-All right!

27:20.025 --> 27:22.481
Help! Help! I'm being mugged!

27:23.153 --> 27:25.823
-Stop it!
-Good luck. See you at the office.

27:27.449 --> 27:29.941
-Don't worry, I'll get him.
-Oh, shit!

27:30.953 --> 27:32.364
Stop right there.

27:37.626 --> 27:38.871
Come on!

27:43.048 --> 27:44.792
What's your problem, pal?

27:52.141 --> 27:53.386
Come up here.

27:54.977 --> 27:57.894
Got your pocketbook. Get a job, pal.

28:00.274 --> 28:01.472
Miss! Miss!

28:01.984 --> 28:04.736
-Are you okay?
-What happened?

28:04.820 --> 28:06.314
Let me help you up.

28:07.364 --> 28:09.357
All right, now. All right.

28:15.247 --> 28:18.533
Ma'am, you were just the victim
of a New York City mugger.

28:18.626 --> 28:21.081
As I suspected,
he was a coward and a weakling.

28:21.170 --> 28:23.922
And also wore more cologne
than any man should wear.

28:24.006 --> 28:26.675
-I got this back for you, though.
-Thank you.

28:27.968 --> 28:30.803
-Can I take you to the hospital?
-No, no.

28:31.764 --> 28:36.177
I'll be all right.
I just feel a little dizzy and violated.

28:37.061 --> 28:38.389
I'm fine.

28:41.398 --> 28:44.150
Please, let me take you
to the emergency room.

28:45.194 --> 28:47.946
I'm sure I'll be all right. I just need to...

28:48.364 --> 28:50.321
...perhaps walk it off or...

28:50.407 --> 28:52.115
-Could you?
-Sure.

28:52.201 --> 28:53.280
Thank you.

28:54.495 --> 28:55.954
Thank you so much.

28:56.997 --> 28:59.667
My name is Pam. Pam Dawson.

29:00.292 --> 29:04.586
My name is Deeds. I'm not from here.
I'm just visiting.

29:06.173 --> 29:07.881
Where do you hail from?

29:08.217 --> 29:12.713
Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire.
Just a little town nobody's ever heard of.

29:13.347 --> 29:15.505
I'm from a little town like that.

29:16.058 --> 29:18.976
-ln lowa.
-ls that right? What part?

29:20.479 --> 29:23.599
Winchestertonfieldville.

29:25.401 --> 29:29.529
Yes, the small town
of Winchestertonfieldville, lowa.

29:32.408 --> 29:33.606
I'm sorry.

29:33.701 --> 29:36.785
-What are you doing in New York?
-I'm a school nurse.

29:37.580 --> 29:41.494
-There's no way you're a school nurse.
-Why, don't you believe me?

29:41.959 --> 29:44.284
You're too nice to be a school nurse.

29:44.587 --> 29:48.335
My school nurse was so mean,
every time I'd tell her I had a tummy ache...

29:48.424 --> 29:51.378
...she'd send me back to my class
and say, "Stop whining."

29:51.468 --> 29:54.256
-But that's awful!
-Well, I said it every day.

29:56.515 --> 29:58.009
I missed my mother.

29:59.518 --> 30:00.847
That's sweet.

30:01.604 --> 30:02.802
Miss Dawson?

30:03.439 --> 30:06.356
How would you like to maybe go out...

30:06.442 --> 30:09.063
...and have a New York City dinner with me?

30:09.320 --> 30:10.482
Golly.

30:12.156 --> 30:13.947
That sounds wonderful.

30:14.158 --> 30:15.617
-lt does?
-Yeah.

30:16.035 --> 30:18.277
-Let's do it, then.
-Okay.

30:19.663 --> 30:21.620
Damn you, Old Spice.

30:25.127 --> 30:28.828
So you run this pizza place
and you have your poetry.

30:29.840 --> 30:31.714
What brings you to the big city?

30:31.801 --> 30:34.338
Actually, I just inherited $40 billion.

30:35.471 --> 30:39.634
Well, that's nice, but I think anything
over $30 billion is just gravy.

30:42.686 --> 30:43.931
I like that.

30:45.022 --> 30:47.893
Your hair is very blond and pretty.

30:47.983 --> 30:51.317
I'm of Swedish ancestry.

30:52.112 --> 30:53.655
-Really?
-Yes.

30:54.532 --> 30:57.486
My grandfather was in ABBA.

30:58.953 --> 31:00.577
ABBA, the band?

31:01.205 --> 31:05.072
Excuse me,
do you get any famous people in here?

31:05.167 --> 31:06.578
Famous, rich, powerful.

31:06.669 --> 31:09.504
Really? We don't get
any famous people in Mandrake Falls.

31:09.588 --> 31:12.079
Stephen King stopped by
our gas station one time...

31:12.174 --> 31:14.546
...but everyone was too scared
to talk to him.

31:14.635 --> 31:16.426
I'd imagine he'd be very spooky.

31:16.512 --> 31:19.881
Jake, the gas station attendant,
made eye contact with him.

31:19.974 --> 31:21.931
That night he lost 200 pounds.

31:24.144 --> 31:25.140
Wow.

31:26.063 --> 31:28.269
Your chicken parmesan
should be ready soon.

31:28.357 --> 31:32.569
Okay, buddy. I saw a couple over there.
It's their anniversary.

31:33.195 --> 31:36.030
Give them this.
Don't say it's from us, though.

31:36.740 --> 31:38.199
This is like $20,000.

31:38.284 --> 31:42.115
Tell them it was a restaurant giveaway
or something. Thanks, buddy.

31:43.372 --> 31:46.788
That's an awfully nice way
to start spending your money.

31:46.876 --> 31:48.952
-ls that who I think it is?
-Who?

31:49.545 --> 31:52.380
Preston Blake's nephew,
the $40-billion man.

31:53.299 --> 31:55.125
We have to meet him. Dave?

31:55.509 --> 31:58.510
Gosh, I hope that mugger got home okay.

31:58.846 --> 32:00.174
-Mr. Deeds.
-Yeah.

32:00.264 --> 32:03.384
Mr. Simonds would like
to invite you to join his party.

32:03.934 --> 32:05.132
Why is that?

32:05.519 --> 32:07.678
Just to enjoy the pleasure of your company.

32:07.771 --> 32:09.811
Wow, that's pretty cool of him.

32:14.194 --> 32:16.271
That was a very nice hug, Deeds.

32:16.405 --> 32:19.774
It's wicked nice of you to invite us over.
This is awesome.

32:19.992 --> 32:23.076
-Have we met?
-Not unless you have a sick kid.

32:23.495 --> 32:26.699
You're a very important man
in this town now, Mr. Deeds.

32:26.791 --> 32:28.201
I don't know about that.

32:28.292 --> 32:30.119
I sing at the Metropolitan Opera...

32:30.210 --> 32:33.876
...and Blake Media contributes
50 percent of our budget.

32:33.964 --> 32:35.874
So, on behalf of the opera:

32:35.966 --> 32:39.916
"Thank you"

32:43.098 --> 32:44.509
That was awesome!

32:44.850 --> 32:48.017
You shouldn't thank me, though.
You should thank my great-uncle.

32:48.103 --> 32:49.479
He was an interesting man.

32:49.563 --> 32:51.971
I served on the board
of the Guggenheim with him.

32:52.066 --> 32:55.399
Really? I'm not sure what that is,
but good luck with it.

32:56.320 --> 32:59.155
I'd love to write a piece on you
for The New Yorker.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.817
What's The New Yorker?

33:01.784 --> 33:03.159
It's a magazine.

33:03.953 --> 33:06.622
With essays, witty cartoons.

33:07.331 --> 33:11.281
I read the Mandrake Falls Gazette
and they got some cartoons in there also.

33:11.377 --> 33:13.950
You know who's a riot?
That Beetle Bailey guy.

33:14.046 --> 33:16.917
He's always wearing his hat
and doing his thing.

33:17.258 --> 33:20.045
But it is an honour to meet
a real writer like you, George.

33:20.135 --> 33:22.757
I've been trying
to get my stuff published for years...

33:22.847 --> 33:25.053
...but Hallmark is one tough cookie to crack.

33:25.140 --> 33:27.678
-Hallmark?
-He writes greeting cards.

33:28.394 --> 33:31.560
-I try.
-You must share one with us.

33:31.647 --> 33:35.230
-I don't know about that, Mr. French.
-Who's Mr. French?

33:35.317 --> 33:38.603
-Doesn't he look like Mr. French?
-I've never heard of him.

33:38.696 --> 33:39.645
Come on.

33:39.738 --> 33:41.363
All right, I'll give you one.

33:41.448 --> 33:44.070
This is a Mother's Day card
I've been working on.

33:44.160 --> 33:48.240
"Mom, you are the one
who brought me to planet Earth

33:49.123 --> 33:52.243
"You are the one who suffered
through my 14-hour birth

33:52.960 --> 33:56.910
"You're the one who made lemonade for me
after I'd come back from play

33:57.339 --> 34:01.467
"I love you, Mom,
so have a wicked nice Mother's Day"

34:02.011 --> 34:03.553
Something like that.

34:04.221 --> 34:07.471
-An instant classic!
-"Genius, genius, genius"

34:07.850 --> 34:10.222
Do you write your poems with a crayon?

34:14.188 --> 34:15.469
It's amazing!

34:16.817 --> 34:19.735
I see why you brought me here.
To goof on me, huh?

34:20.196 --> 34:22.768
-Don't be silly, Deeds.
-Pipe down, George.

34:23.197 --> 34:26.235
I may seem funny to you,
but if you came to Mandrake Falls...

34:26.327 --> 34:29.447
...you might seem funny to us.
Only nobody would laugh at you...

34:29.538 --> 34:32.409
...and make you feel stupid,
that wouldn't be good manners.

34:32.500 --> 34:36.165
Maybe my poems aren't that great,
but I know some people who like them.

34:36.253 --> 34:40.297
Anyways, it's the best I can do.
We're going to get going.

34:40.382 --> 34:43.585
Sorry about that, Pam.
I hope I didn't embarrass you.

34:48.599 --> 34:52.217
And if it wasn't for Miss Dawson being here,
I'd knock your heads in.

34:52.311 --> 34:53.509
I don't mind.

34:53.812 --> 34:54.808
Okay.

34:58.484 --> 34:59.479
"No!"

35:06.241 --> 35:10.109
I think I just shat myself.

35:10.996 --> 35:13.369
How would you like to see the sights now?

35:13.457 --> 35:15.995
I just need to powder my nose.

35:16.085 --> 35:18.623
That would be great. I'll get your coat.

35:19.088 --> 35:22.872
Hey, buddy, this will pay for everything
I damaged. Sorry about that.

35:22.967 --> 35:25.339
-Good to meet you guys.
-Thank you.

35:25.427 --> 35:27.171
God, that was good stuff.

35:30.641 --> 35:32.183
I want a raise, Mac.

35:36.564 --> 35:38.390
Hey, man! What's up?

35:38.691 --> 35:40.849
Holy cannoli, you're John McEnroe!

35:40.943 --> 35:44.027
I saw what you did to those guys
making fun of you. Nice work.

35:44.113 --> 35:47.232
You know what it's like to get riled up
don't you, Johnny Mac?

35:47.324 --> 35:50.160
-That I do.
-I'm Deeds, by the way.

35:50.244 --> 35:53.945
Deeds, nice to meet you.
You got to let me buy you a drink.

35:54.039 --> 35:55.831
Miss Dawson, this is John McEnroe.

35:55.916 --> 35:59.581
-Miss Dawson, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

35:59.795 --> 36:02.369
I promised Miss Dawson
I'd take her sightseeing.

36:02.465 --> 36:05.715
The sights are great.
I've seen the sights. I love the sights.

36:05.801 --> 36:08.885
Let me show you a New York
most people will never see.

36:09.346 --> 36:12.715
-That okay with you, Miss Dawson?
-Sounds like fun!

36:12.808 --> 36:15.299
Here's to a big night on the town.

36:27.781 --> 36:29.441
What happened?

36:29.533 --> 36:33.780
Here are some aspirins, Mr. Deeds.
They make your head seem smaller.

36:37.791 --> 36:40.958
-How did I get in these pyjamas?
-I changed you.

36:41.504 --> 36:43.164
I was very gentle, sir.

36:44.673 --> 36:48.007
I think I drank all the alcohol in Manhattan
last night.

36:48.302 --> 36:51.303
And you nearly succeeded,
according to Miss Dawson.

36:52.181 --> 36:55.846
Miss Dawson! I don't even remember
taking her home. Is she okay?

36:55.935 --> 36:59.185
I took the liberty of sending her off
in the company limousine.

36:59.271 --> 37:02.272
She was a lady in distress and I helped her.

37:02.858 --> 37:04.768
Dreamt about her last night.

37:05.069 --> 37:08.153
Usually, when you get blackout drunk
you don't dream.

37:09.406 --> 37:10.486
So I read.

37:15.079 --> 37:16.489
What's up, Chuck?

37:19.917 --> 37:22.075
America's newest billionaire...

37:23.796 --> 37:25.835
-...stupid and drunk.
-What's this?

37:25.923 --> 37:28.840
It was quite a night for Longfellow Deeds.

37:28.926 --> 37:31.547
They'll know my name is Longfellow.

37:32.012 --> 37:34.503
After punching out some society types...

37:35.891 --> 37:40.304
...Deeds joined forces with the original
bad boy of tennis, John McEnroe.

37:40.604 --> 37:43.060
And stupidity won in straight sets.

37:50.031 --> 37:51.940
How'd they get that footage?

37:52.241 --> 37:53.901
Watch out, Johnny!

37:56.579 --> 37:59.745
What kind of driving is that?
You're a fucking disgrace!

38:00.416 --> 38:02.455
No, sir. You're a disgrace.

38:02.543 --> 38:04.832
-We did it, man!
-Johnny McEnroe!

38:04.920 --> 38:08.254
Look at Deedsy hanging out with McEnroe!
That's awesome!

38:09.008 --> 38:10.632
I love the Beach Boys.

38:11.343 --> 38:13.466
Here I go, here I go.

38:15.848 --> 38:18.635
This is not the kind of attention
we need right now.

38:18.726 --> 38:19.805
What do you mean?

38:19.894 --> 38:22.729
For the moment
you're the largest stockholder...

38:22.813 --> 38:25.351
...and people might think
any instability you show...

38:25.441 --> 38:27.932
...may equal instability in the company.

38:31.697 --> 38:32.693
My bad.

38:34.742 --> 38:36.984
My bad. My bad.

38:37.077 --> 38:38.026
Okay. Okay.

38:38.120 --> 38:39.199
-My bad.
-Okay.

38:39.288 --> 38:42.455
Shall I call your car, Mr. Cedar,
to take you to the funeral?

38:42.541 --> 38:43.870
What funeral?

38:44.793 --> 38:46.418
Your great-uncle's funeral.

38:46.503 --> 38:48.662
-His funeral's today?
-Today, yes.

38:48.839 --> 38:50.631
I'll go get my suit on.

38:58.140 --> 39:00.263
-Cute, bigmouth.
-Sir?

39:00.684 --> 39:03.056
As soon as that moron goes back
to Cowpie Falls...

39:03.145 --> 39:06.182
...you are out of here
on your fat Puerto Rican ass.

39:10.820 --> 39:12.527
I hail from Spain, sir.

39:18.702 --> 39:19.947
Ole.

39:21.330 --> 39:25.410
Now, Brother Preston is soaring
with eagles high above.

39:26.669 --> 39:29.290
Because he lived a life of love.

39:30.881 --> 39:33.716
Yes, he's flying way up high...

39:34.677 --> 39:37.250
...because he was a super cool guy.

39:38.597 --> 39:41.966
He's gone away, too soon, it seems...

39:42.601 --> 39:45.519
...leaving behind his unfinished dreams.

39:45.855 --> 39:48.606
This guy could make a fortune
writing greeting cards.

39:48.691 --> 39:51.526
Yes, we remember Preston Blake...

39:52.027 --> 39:54.863
...a man with faith no man could shake.

39:55.698 --> 39:57.856
A strength no man could break.

39:58.409 --> 40:00.900
A character no man could fake.

40:01.704 --> 40:04.277
For goodness sake, let's eat some cake.

40:04.665 --> 40:06.124
Amen.

40:08.043 --> 40:10.961
Excuse me, Reverend,
that was a grand slam.

40:11.046 --> 40:13.964
That part with soaring with the eagles
gave me goose bumps.

40:14.049 --> 40:17.383
-Thank you, my brother.
-My friend got me a mug for my birthday.

40:17.469 --> 40:21.467
It says, "It's hard to soar with the eagles
when you're surrounded by turkeys."

40:21.557 --> 40:23.514
But what you said was better.

40:23.726 --> 40:25.006
It's all good.

40:25.394 --> 40:29.308
Rest in peace, Preston.
That concludes today's service.

40:30.858 --> 40:33.396
I actually thought I would say something.

40:34.945 --> 40:37.650
Deedsy was always
the best speaker in school.

40:38.323 --> 40:39.154
Deedsy?

40:39.241 --> 40:41.649
That's some job, by the way, Your Majesty.

40:41.744 --> 40:44.116
I thought we were watching Scooby-Doo.

40:44.580 --> 40:48.744
Hi, my name is Deeds.
I was Preston Blake's great-nephew.

40:49.168 --> 40:52.501
I wrote a poem for him
on my way over here, in my head.

40:52.838 --> 40:55.246
And I'm going to recite it for you.

40:55.925 --> 40:59.922
I didn't realize I'd be following
the rhyme-master Reverend Sharpton.

41:00.387 --> 41:02.095
But here we go anyways.

41:02.681 --> 41:05.635
"You climbed mountains
and built skyscrapers

41:06.852 --> 41:10.766
"You made TV shows
and put out newspapers

41:12.441 --> 41:15.014
"You were wicked good at doing stocks

41:16.153 --> 41:19.024
"You liked it
when Emilio would change your socks

41:20.282 --> 41:23.117
"We never hung out and that makes me sad

41:23.953 --> 41:26.278
"All the good times we could've had"

41:26.998 --> 41:28.456
Nice rhyme.

41:28.916 --> 41:32.367
"But when I die, Uncle Preston,
you better say, 'Cheers!'

41:33.128 --> 41:35.798
"'Cause me and you are hanging
at the pearly gates

41:35.881 --> 41:39.796
"I'll bring the beers, I'll bring the beers"

41:40.511 --> 41:41.590
He's good.

41:42.137 --> 41:43.133
Amen.

41:43.222 --> 41:46.887
I know this is supposed to be
a closed casket, but where I come from...

41:46.976 --> 41:50.890
...we feel it's good to see the body
for the grieving process, so...

41:53.607 --> 41:56.608
Sorry about that!
I'll keep this sucker closed.

42:01.448 --> 42:03.275
He's still pretty frozen.

42:03.909 --> 42:05.154
Almost there.

42:07.413 --> 42:09.820
I'll keep an eye on the company for you.
Love you.

42:09.915 --> 42:12.585
Nice meeting you.
Thanks for the apartment.

42:12.668 --> 42:14.043
That was freaky.

42:14.336 --> 42:16.128
Everybody drive home safe.

42:16.213 --> 42:18.289
Man, this guy is in way over his head.

42:18.382 --> 42:20.541
-Take care.
-You'll see him tonight?

42:20.634 --> 42:23.968
Yes, I'm calling around 4:00.
That's when I get off work.

42:24.179 --> 42:26.884
Remember, I'm Pam Dawson,
virgin school nurse...

42:27.016 --> 42:29.803
...from Winchestertonfieldville, lowa.

42:32.229 --> 42:33.640
That's priceless.

42:35.065 --> 42:36.310
You, a virgin.

42:42.865 --> 42:45.356
-All right, thank you.
-Excuse me, sir.

42:45.784 --> 42:48.192
-I told him he could have that.
-Thanks.

42:48.287 --> 42:50.078
Right on. Nice seeing you.

42:50.164 --> 42:52.951
You need to use our bathroom,
come back and use it, okay?

42:53.041 --> 42:54.999
Will do, Deeds!

42:56.462 --> 42:58.620
How do you think I did at the funeral today?

42:58.714 --> 43:00.541
You spoke beautifully, sir.

43:00.674 --> 43:01.837
I still feel bad.

43:01.926 --> 43:05.626
I snapped my uncle's hand off
when I put him back in the casket.

43:06.096 --> 43:08.173
Lucky for him, he was dead, sir.

43:08.557 --> 43:11.178
Even though his face was frozen that way...

43:11.477 --> 43:14.644
...it looked to me like he was a happy guy.
Am I right?

43:14.813 --> 43:17.518
-He truly was.
-Come on, sit down, please.

43:18.025 --> 43:21.476
And I got to hang out with him,
just like this...

43:21.987 --> 43:24.110
...almost every day for 30 years.

43:24.615 --> 43:26.323
What did you guys talk about?

43:26.408 --> 43:30.572
We spoke of life, love, art, wine, business.

43:30.996 --> 43:32.704
I learned much from him.

43:32.998 --> 43:35.038
-I bet you miss him, too.
-I do.

43:35.334 --> 43:37.243
He was like a parent to me.

43:38.003 --> 43:41.088
You see, I never knew my father,
and Mama...

43:41.674 --> 43:44.295
...she passed while giving the birth to me.

43:47.429 --> 43:49.967
-You want some Cocoa Pebbles?
-No, thanks.

43:50.599 --> 43:53.885
I have much work to do.

43:54.186 --> 43:57.472
-Thanks. You don't have to do that.
-Enjoy your Pebbles.

43:58.857 --> 44:00.268
One more thing.

44:00.901 --> 44:04.566
Your great-uncle did not let me
change his socks for him, either.

44:05.531 --> 44:06.776
I like feet.

44:07.783 --> 44:09.242
I do not know why.

44:17.626 --> 44:18.456
Hello.

44:18.544 --> 44:21.213
Hi, Deeds? It's Pam. Pam Dawson.

44:21.297 --> 44:25.294
I'm so happy you called.
I'm wicked sorry about last night.

44:25.384 --> 44:26.961
I don't drink very often.

44:27.052 --> 44:29.923
I thought you held your liquor very well.

44:30.014 --> 44:32.421
Unfortunately, I couldn't hold it for too long.

44:32.516 --> 44:36.134
That's okay.
I didn't really like that skirt anyway.

44:37.438 --> 44:40.889
I'm getting a call on the other line.
Can you hang on for a second?

44:40.983 --> 44:42.643
-Sure.
-Thank you.

44:43.319 --> 44:44.101
Hello.

44:44.195 --> 44:47.563
Mr. Deeds, this is Kevin Ward,
the quarterback you punched.

44:47.781 --> 44:49.192
What's up, buddy?

44:49.366 --> 44:54.324
I wanted to say that I was thinking it over
and I'd like to live up to my word.

44:54.580 --> 44:56.371
And I'd like to win you a Super Bowl.

44:56.457 --> 44:59.826
-That's terrific, pal.
-And my daddy wants to speak to you.

45:00.503 --> 45:02.910
Deeds. Buddy Ward here, Kevin's daddy.

45:03.005 --> 45:04.168
How you doing, Mr. Ward?

45:04.256 --> 45:06.629
I just want to thank you
for teaching my boy a lesson.

45:06.717 --> 45:10.715
He's a good kid. He just has to watch
his language in front of the ladies.

45:13.807 --> 45:15.930
I'll remind Kevin where he comes from.

45:16.018 --> 45:17.477
That sounds terrific.

45:17.561 --> 45:20.681
You used foul language in front of a lady?

45:21.440 --> 45:22.685
No, Daddy, no!

45:26.821 --> 45:27.686
Pam.

45:28.030 --> 45:29.193
Still here.

45:29.281 --> 45:30.906
How's it going? You at work?

45:30.991 --> 45:34.158
-Yep, here in the nurse's office.
-Any customers?

45:34.954 --> 45:37.112
Customers? Oh, sick kids.

45:38.082 --> 45:41.415
Well, little Billy Barty's here.

45:42.252 --> 45:47.247
-You're not feeling too good, Billy?
-Miss Dawson, my tummy hurts.

45:47.550 --> 45:50.005
Why don't you just lay back and relax?

45:50.636 --> 45:52.213
That was nice. Good job.

45:52.304 --> 45:56.053
I've got too much doo-doo
in my underpants.

45:57.142 --> 45:59.468
Make the stinky go away.

45:59.854 --> 46:02.854
Well, you sound like
you got your hands full, so...

46:02.982 --> 46:04.974
...l'll just come out with it.

46:05.234 --> 46:08.235
How would you like
to do something with me tonight?

46:08.612 --> 46:10.521
I'd love to do something with you.

46:10.614 --> 46:11.563
Great.

46:11.698 --> 46:14.368
We can't go out drinking.
I got our company in trouble.

46:14.451 --> 46:18.070
That's okay.
I was brought up never to drink alcohol.

46:18.789 --> 46:20.746
Not even rum raisin ice cream.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.621
I like that. I'll think of something good.

46:24.211 --> 46:25.242
See you tonight.

46:25.337 --> 46:26.535
Okay. 'Bye.

46:30.467 --> 46:32.010
I got to try this.

46:44.857 --> 46:46.268
Was that awesome?

46:47.943 --> 46:49.568
Am I out or safe?

46:51.405 --> 46:52.864
I'm with you.

46:54.825 --> 46:58.490
What is this?
My great-uncle's personal journal.

47:00.039 --> 47:02.530
-Should I read it?
-Family.

47:04.293 --> 47:06.084
Family, safe, good.

47:06.503 --> 47:10.169
All right, have a good night. My back hurts!

47:15.012 --> 47:17.384
-Nice doing business with you.
-Thank you.

47:17.473 --> 47:19.015
Thanks for the bikes.

47:19.099 --> 47:21.590
What are you gonna do with your $20,000?

47:21.685 --> 47:24.473
Buy a giraffe.
What are you gonna do with your $20,000?

47:24.563 --> 47:26.022
Quit school.

47:26.106 --> 47:30.270
Good idea, school is for fools. Look at me!

47:55.719 --> 47:57.593
The park is beautiful.

47:58.514 --> 48:02.179
These trees, they remind you
of Winchestertonfieldville at all?

48:03.269 --> 48:05.594
Oh, yes. Very much so.

48:06.272 --> 48:08.430
What was it like growing up there?

48:08.565 --> 48:09.811
It was great.

48:10.526 --> 48:14.274
I remember walking down
to the corner drugstore...

48:14.363 --> 48:16.652
...and getting malted milkshakes.

48:17.783 --> 48:19.574
What was your house like?

48:20.035 --> 48:22.324
We had this big Victorian.

48:23.372 --> 48:25.080
Right off Main Street.

48:25.875 --> 48:29.623
-Blue shutters and a big red door.
-All right.

48:30.004 --> 48:33.918
-And a tire swing in the front yard.
-I love it.

48:34.383 --> 48:38.926
And I remember the time I fell out of
old Boo Radley's apple tree...

48:39.054 --> 48:40.596
...and broke my arm.

48:41.098 --> 48:45.511
And my father, before he passed away...

48:45.936 --> 48:48.178
...from the disease of the lepers...

48:48.272 --> 48:52.601
...he came and he scooped me up
and he ran me all the way to Dr. Pepper's.

48:54.236 --> 48:55.399
Dr. Pepper.

48:56.238 --> 48:57.234
Yeah.

48:57.531 --> 48:59.488
I'm glad that guy was around.

49:00.242 --> 49:02.484
-Want to sit down?
-Sure.

49:04.538 --> 49:06.246
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

49:06.749 --> 49:10.200
I was reading my great-uncle's journal
on my way over to you.

49:10.294 --> 49:12.536
And, when he was age 9...

49:12.630 --> 49:16.378
...he wrote that he had the only family
on the block with a radio...

49:16.467 --> 49:19.384
...and he was dreaming
of becoming a disc jockey someday.

49:19.470 --> 49:21.795
A disc jockey?

49:24.099 --> 49:27.468
You know, when I was a kid,
I wanted to be a news reporter.

49:28.437 --> 49:31.189
I used to go around interviewing everyone...

49:31.273 --> 49:34.440
...and writing notes
in my little Holly Hobby notebook.

49:36.237 --> 49:39.487
People didn't like that. I got beat up a lot.

49:39.657 --> 49:43.606
-Do you remember their names?
-No, it was a long time ago.

49:44.787 --> 49:46.530
But my grandma said to me:

49:46.914 --> 49:50.117
"One day you'll grow up
and work for 60 Minutes...

49:50.209 --> 49:52.700
"...and make a difference in the world."

49:53.212 --> 49:57.292
You do make a difference in the world,
every day. You're a school nurse.

50:00.427 --> 50:02.550
Anyways, this is what happened
to my uncle.

50:02.638 --> 50:06.849
Later on in his life, he'd go
to this radio station that he owned...

50:06.934 --> 50:09.852
...at 3:00 in the morning and DJ for an hour.

50:09.937 --> 50:11.182
That's great.

50:12.189 --> 50:15.356
So, don't give up hope.
You'll be a reporter someday.

50:15.943 --> 50:17.521
If you really want to.

50:18.988 --> 50:20.612
That would be nice.

50:23.701 --> 50:25.824
-Jeesum Crow, a fire!
-A fire?

50:26.328 --> 50:28.202
-We should help.
-We should?

50:28.289 --> 50:30.281
-Let's get going.
-To the fire?

50:30.833 --> 50:34.498
-Fifi, get over here right now.
-Come on, we'll catch you.

50:34.837 --> 50:38.372
Go away! I can't leave without my kitties.
They're all I got.

50:39.466 --> 50:40.332
Crazy lady!

50:40.426 --> 50:43.462
-Oh, babies, where are you?
-Up there now, get going!

50:43.762 --> 50:48.424
Longfellow Deeds, Mandrake Falls
volunteer fire chief. I'll be up there in a jiff.

50:48.517 --> 50:51.553
-He's crazy!
-He's going up there right now, though.

50:51.687 --> 50:53.763
-Look at him.
-Where's he going?

50:54.815 --> 50:56.013
Watch it, man!

50:56.317 --> 50:58.808
-Sully, who's that guy up there?
-I don't know.

50:58.903 --> 51:01.987
He says he's from
the Mandrake Falls Fire Department.

51:02.698 --> 51:06.281
-How's he climb like that?
-He must have monkey blood in him.

51:06.368 --> 51:09.038
It's an honour to work
with New York's bravest, guys.

51:09.121 --> 51:10.450
Be careful!

51:10.539 --> 51:13.955
-I'll get you.
-Babies, where are you?

51:14.043 --> 51:16.284
-Ma'am!
-Lord, it's hot in here.

51:16.503 --> 51:19.837
-Kitties, come to Mommy.
-Calm down. Everything will be all right.

51:19.924 --> 51:22.165
Okay, but I'm not leaving without my kitties.

51:22.259 --> 51:24.051
-How many do you got?
-Seven.

51:24.136 --> 51:26.176
Holy shit! Let's get cracking.

51:27.890 --> 51:30.760
-I apologize for the language.
-Apology accepted.

51:35.481 --> 51:38.150
-Fire excites me.
-Knock yourself out.

51:40.069 --> 51:42.357
-Come here.
-That's Freddy.

51:43.197 --> 51:46.198
-Here we go!
-Oh, my children!

51:52.331 --> 51:55.202
-Nice catch, Pam!
-Good throw, Deeds!

52:06.428 --> 52:09.928
-That's Frobo. Thank you, darling.
-Coming at you, boys.

52:13.894 --> 52:15.223
I'll take that.

52:16.021 --> 52:18.263
-There's a lot more.
-Okay, okay.

52:30.494 --> 52:32.238
Holy shit, it's a cat!

52:35.958 --> 52:38.116
Full snap. I got you, kitty.

52:40.713 --> 52:42.041
Nice grab!

52:43.507 --> 52:44.788
One more to go.

52:45.259 --> 52:47.382
Fifi, where are you?

52:48.637 --> 52:51.638
-I think I found Fifi.
-Oh, good!

52:52.474 --> 52:54.348
Hang in there, buddy!

52:55.853 --> 52:57.098
I got it!

53:04.904 --> 53:06.813
Okay, let's do this together.

53:08.073 --> 53:09.568
Be careful!

53:09.658 --> 53:12.529
All right, they do it all the time. Here we go.

53:15.748 --> 53:16.827
Oh, shit!

53:20.377 --> 53:21.373
Deeds.

53:21.921 --> 53:23.249
I'm okay.

53:23.798 --> 53:25.042
Are you okay?

53:26.217 --> 53:28.542
Yes, I am. Thanks to you!

53:30.971 --> 53:32.430
You're hurting me!

53:36.560 --> 53:38.767
Longfellow Deeds is at it again.

53:39.438 --> 53:41.561
His latest victim, Coretta Keeling...

53:41.648 --> 53:44.436
...whose only crime
was loving her cats too much.

53:44.526 --> 53:46.768
And letting Deeds find out about it.

53:47.071 --> 53:49.396
-I'll get you!
-Go away!

53:50.199 --> 53:52.191
-I love it.
-Here comes two!

53:55.037 --> 53:58.287
-Cat killer!
-After he finished with her cats...

53:58.374 --> 54:01.244
...he turned his sights
on Miss Keeling herself.

54:03.587 --> 54:04.832
My God!

54:05.381 --> 54:06.709
That's not what I shot.

54:06.799 --> 54:09.504
Has Longfellow Deeds been locked up?
Of course not.

54:09.593 --> 54:14.089
While the rest of us obey the law,
rich playboys like himself get to laugh at it.

54:15.724 --> 54:19.140
Longfellow Deeds. Our jackass of the week.

54:20.062 --> 54:22.351
What the hell? Who edited that?

54:22.690 --> 54:27.019
I did. Your first cut was great,
but I needed to spice it up a bit.

54:27.319 --> 54:29.229
The truth was a great story.

54:29.613 --> 54:32.614
He saved that woman and her seven cats.

54:32.699 --> 54:35.404
-He was heroic!
-Heroic is nice.

54:35.703 --> 54:38.241
-Depraved and insane is better.
-Hell, yeah!

54:38.330 --> 54:42.114
This footage you're getting, gorgeous.
Keep it coming!

54:43.210 --> 54:45.748
God, how can we do this
to such a sweet guy?

54:45.838 --> 54:47.877
Sweet? Sweet?

54:48.591 --> 54:50.049
Look at me!

54:50.134 --> 54:53.668
Was he sweet when he gave me
the most savage beating of my life?

54:53.762 --> 54:56.051
-You were mugging me!
-Babe!

54:56.891 --> 55:00.224
No one is as good
as this guy's pretending to be.

55:00.853 --> 55:02.395
Don't be a sucker.

55:03.063 --> 55:04.771
He doesn't deserve this.

55:06.942 --> 55:08.602
He doesn't deserve you.

55:10.237 --> 55:11.566
My neck!

55:16.243 --> 55:20.407
I feel like an idiot.
They made me look like a fool, Jan.

55:21.082 --> 55:24.450
I was thinking of going down
to that Inside Access place...

55:24.585 --> 55:27.586
...and giving Mac McGrath
the beating of a lifetime.

55:27.963 --> 55:31.249
That sounds like fun,
but don't stoop to their level.

55:31.759 --> 55:33.835
You're better than that, Deedsy.

55:34.011 --> 55:37.546
So hang in there.
And know that we are always here for you.

55:39.600 --> 55:42.934
Thanks, Jan.
My uncle really built an amazing company.

55:43.520 --> 55:46.770
Because of him, 50, 000 people have jobs.

55:47.274 --> 55:49.848
And he always tried to do the right thing.

55:50.861 --> 55:53.103
Well, he does sound amazing.

55:53.656 --> 55:56.906
But don't forget, he was related to you.

55:57.326 --> 56:01.739
Enough about that.
Tell me more about this girl.

56:02.998 --> 56:06.616
She's nice, a small-town kid, like me.

56:07.461 --> 56:10.379
Deedsy, you sick ass mo' fo'...

56:10.464 --> 56:13.964
You got to tap that
before she starts boning other guys, kid.

56:14.593 --> 56:15.625
Boo-Yah!

56:17.554 --> 56:20.923
He thinks it's you! He thinks it's you!

56:22.309 --> 56:26.437
-Let's go, Cedar. Put some steam on it, kid.
-Here it comes.

56:29.149 --> 56:31.901
He's trying to kill me. You're good at this.

56:31.986 --> 56:35.236
When you asked me to play,
I thought you'd done this before.

56:35.322 --> 56:38.074
No, Johnny McEnroe said
it was wicked easy.

56:38.325 --> 56:40.532
Plus, it was my uncle's
favourite game, right?

56:40.619 --> 56:43.324
-How'd you know that?
-I read it in his diary.

56:44.165 --> 56:45.160
Really?

56:46.166 --> 56:48.159
I didn't know he kept a diary.

56:52.381 --> 56:54.089
Sorry about that, dude.

56:54.216 --> 56:56.292
It's okay. He's a new member.

56:57.094 --> 56:58.173
Ball boy.

56:59.221 --> 57:00.301
Ball boy!

57:02.641 --> 57:04.848
All right, baby, I'm ready for you.

57:09.273 --> 57:10.436
You okay?

57:10.691 --> 57:13.478
-Not a problem.
-Anderson, you liked that, didn't you?

57:13.569 --> 57:14.731
I did.

57:14.945 --> 57:17.317
Listen, Deeds, I got some good news.

57:17.406 --> 57:19.564
Those papers will be ready
to sign tomorrow.

57:19.658 --> 57:23.110
So you can relax knowing
your uncle's company'll be in good hands...

57:23.203 --> 57:25.362
...and you can go home $40 billion richer.

57:25.456 --> 57:28.029
I was thinking about
maybe sticking around here...

57:28.125 --> 57:30.877
-...and going to some meetings with you.
-What?

57:33.005 --> 57:34.168
Fault!

57:34.298 --> 57:37.168
I figured I could learn, like this tennis thing.

57:40.638 --> 57:43.307
I swear to God, I'm not trying to do that.

57:44.809 --> 57:47.644
I don't got to sell my shares right away,
do I?

57:48.062 --> 57:51.894
Plus, I met this girl, Cedar.
I swear to God, I think she's the one.

57:53.150 --> 57:54.894
That's wonderful for you.

57:57.822 --> 58:00.194
That got you right in the throat, huh?

58:01.450 --> 58:04.736
Got to ask you, though, if it hits you,
is it my point or yours?

58:04.829 --> 58:07.154
-Yours.
-I'm winning then, I guess.

58:13.128 --> 58:16.332
"Deeds info, meet in shower"?

58:21.637 --> 58:23.012
Sweet Jesus!

58:23.722 --> 58:27.056
Who are you?
And what do you want to tell me?

58:27.601 --> 58:30.009
I'm a junior producer at Inside Access.

58:30.437 --> 58:34.518
I have information that will help you
get Deeds out of town. Interested?

58:34.900 --> 58:39.527
Very. Provided the information is good
and you stop soaping your ass.

58:43.534 --> 58:46.286
-You know Deeds' girlfriend?
-The school nurse.

58:46.870 --> 58:48.199
Not quite.

58:50.499 --> 58:54.164
Lucy, bring me the overnights.
J.D. will tell you where they are.

58:54.336 --> 58:57.088
Hey. What the hell are you doing
in my chair?

58:57.631 --> 58:58.829
Chuck Cedar.

58:59.508 --> 59:02.177
I think you and I could help each other out.

59:06.390 --> 59:09.723
-You excited about this trip?
-I'm so excited.

59:10.394 --> 59:13.680
-Where are you taking me?
-I told you, that's a surprise.

59:20.529 --> 59:21.560
Well?

59:23.574 --> 59:26.243
"Winchestertonfieldville, lowa."

59:27.244 --> 59:29.071
You got to be shitting me.

59:29.705 --> 59:31.698
I never heard you curse before.

59:31.791 --> 59:33.333
I'm that excited!

59:37.129 --> 59:41.791
All you Winchestertonfieldvillians,
recognize this little girl?

59:44.595 --> 59:47.798
I'll give you a hint.
"I fell out of Boo Radley's apple tree...

59:47.890 --> 59:49.883
"...and my arm is killing me!"

59:53.937 --> 59:56.096
Come on, it's little Pammy Dawson!

59:58.108 --> 59:59.140
Hello.

01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:01.895
You related to Bill Dawson?

01:00:02.196 --> 01:00:04.947
Yes, he's my relative.

01:00:05.783 --> 01:00:07.491
I think I remember you.

01:00:08.202 --> 01:00:10.693
Did you used to have a hump on your back?

01:00:11.622 --> 01:00:15.620
-Yes, that was me. I had a slight hump.
-Really?

01:00:15.709 --> 01:00:17.417
This was no slight hump.

01:00:17.628 --> 01:00:21.839
The girl I'm thinking of looked like
she had a damn beach ball on her back.

01:00:22.216 --> 01:00:25.916
Okay, it was a huge hump
and I'm a little sensitive about it.

01:00:26.136 --> 01:00:29.256
Look, Martha,
it's Quasimodo, all growed up.

01:00:29.515 --> 01:00:32.681
How wonderful! I thought you died.

01:00:33.936 --> 01:00:36.142
She actually became a school nurse.

01:00:36.272 --> 01:00:37.814
-You're a nurse?
-Yes.

01:00:38.107 --> 01:00:40.016
What should I do about this?

01:00:47.199 --> 01:00:49.524
-I would call Dr. Pepper.
-Who?

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:53.990
It was so great seeing everybody again.
We're going to leave now.

01:00:54.331 --> 01:00:55.245
'Bye.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.329
-Hi, mailman.
-'Morning.

01:00:58.419 --> 01:00:59.747
How you doing?

01:01:03.257 --> 01:01:04.965
Oh, my God, there it is.

01:01:05.176 --> 01:01:09.422
Blue shutters, red door, tire swing.
That's your house, isn't it?

01:01:10.848 --> 01:01:12.425
Wouldn't you know it?

01:01:12.975 --> 01:01:14.137
Come on.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.391
How you guys doing?
You know who she is?

01:01:20.774 --> 01:01:23.811
She used to live in this house
when she was a little girl.

01:01:23.903 --> 01:01:24.851
It's true.

01:01:24.945 --> 01:01:28.777
You live here and she used to live here.
You're practically cousins.

01:01:31.285 --> 01:01:33.076
So many memories.

01:01:34.872 --> 01:01:36.247
Where to begin?

01:01:37.082 --> 01:01:39.490
This is our fireplace...

01:01:40.044 --> 01:01:42.582
...where my dad would build fires...

01:01:43.339 --> 01:01:44.370
...out of wood.

01:01:44.465 --> 01:01:48.213
And this is the dining room,
where we would have our meals...

01:01:48.302 --> 01:01:49.677
...made of food.

01:01:50.054 --> 01:01:52.461
And this was my brother's room.

01:01:53.307 --> 01:01:55.216
My parents hated my brother.

01:01:55.476 --> 01:01:59.010
My daddy built this house
with his bare hands six years ago.

01:02:00.022 --> 01:02:01.730
Your daddy is a liar.

01:02:02.733 --> 01:02:04.061
How come you...

01:02:07.321 --> 01:02:10.156
He's choking. We should go.

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.150
-Help.
-What are you talking about?

01:02:12.243 --> 01:02:14.615
-You're the nurse, help him.
-Save him!

01:02:14.745 --> 01:02:17.117
-Stand back, kids.
-He's gonna die!

01:02:17.707 --> 01:02:20.197
-Take him to the hospital!
-Smack it out!

01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:22.701
-Save him!
-Get it out of him!

01:02:23.087 --> 01:02:24.498
Save him, please!

01:02:29.969 --> 01:02:32.257
-That was amazing.
-Thank you.

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:34.341
I saved his life.

01:02:35.307 --> 01:02:37.217
You're my hero, Nurse Dawson.

01:02:42.398 --> 01:02:43.975
Thank you, thank you.

01:02:45.234 --> 01:02:47.642
-Good parking job, buddy.
-Thanks, Deeds.

01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:49.612
Testing, testing.

01:02:50.031 --> 01:02:52.106
I had such a wonderful time.

01:02:52.449 --> 01:02:54.905
Thank you for such a great day.

01:02:56.579 --> 01:03:00.623
-Thanks for showing me your town.
-I hope sometime to see your hometown.

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:03.871
Maybe someday this will be
my new hometown.

01:03:05.129 --> 01:03:06.125
Deeds.

01:03:07.047 --> 01:03:10.381
-There's something I have to tell you.
-What's the matter?

01:03:12.344 --> 01:03:13.258
What?

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:17.930
Go back to New Hampshire
and enjoy being rich.

01:03:18.684 --> 01:03:19.799
Just...

01:03:20.394 --> 01:03:23.015
...don't let anyone hurt you anymore, okay?

01:03:24.565 --> 01:03:25.728
Sucker.

01:03:28.736 --> 01:03:29.731
Pam.

01:03:31.822 --> 01:03:33.400
I made a card for you.

01:03:34.158 --> 01:03:35.486
It's kind of dumb.

01:03:35.576 --> 01:03:39.408
I never worked on anything harder, though,
so don't laugh at me.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.744
Remember we went to the restaurant
that first night...

01:03:43.834 --> 01:03:45.743
...and you ordered chicken parmesan?

01:03:45.836 --> 01:03:47.496
So I drew you a plate.

01:03:48.297 --> 01:03:50.788
There's the chicken and the cheese...

01:03:51.467 --> 01:03:55.251
...and the linguini. That took me
a long time with the squigglies.

01:03:56.305 --> 01:03:57.585
It's beautiful.

01:03:57.932 --> 01:04:00.008
There's a poem inside for you.

01:04:04.813 --> 01:04:07.565
"Hard to breathe, feels like floating

01:04:08.567 --> 01:04:11.651
"So full of love my heart's exploding

01:04:13.822 --> 01:04:16.148
"Mouth is dry, hands are shaking

01:04:17.493 --> 01:04:19.651
"My heart is yours for the taking

01:04:21.539 --> 01:04:24.076
"Acting weird, not myself

01:04:26.126 --> 01:04:29.376
"Dancing around like the Keebler elf"

01:04:30.131 --> 01:04:31.459
That was funny.

01:04:33.509 --> 01:04:36.296
"Finally time for this poor schlub

01:04:37.012 --> 01:04:39.847
"To know how it feels to fall in lub"

01:04:41.016 --> 01:04:44.183
I couldn't think of anything else
that rhymes with "schlub."

01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:46.179
"Rub" and "tub" didn't work.

01:04:55.948 --> 01:04:57.442
I'm sorry, Deeds.

01:04:59.869 --> 01:05:04.329
-I'm really sorry.
-Don't be sorry, that was unbelievable.

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:11.995
Hi, Mrs. Finch... Atticus.

01:05:13.382 --> 01:05:14.710
Sleep well.

01:05:18.929 --> 01:05:21.764
-Al, I'm gonna walk home.
-Okay, Deeds.

01:05:31.567 --> 01:05:33.559
I love New York!

01:05:33.944 --> 01:05:35.487
Nobody cares!

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.698
I'm in love with him.

01:05:45.956 --> 01:05:49.041
I'm going to see him tonight
and tell him everything.

01:05:50.961 --> 01:05:54.247
-He'll probably punch you in the face.
-I kind of hope he does.

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:56.665
Come on, Babe, snap out of it.

01:05:56.759 --> 01:06:00.210
You really want to throw all this away
for a dipshit like that?

01:06:00.304 --> 01:06:04.882
He's not a dipshit. He's a good-hearted guy
who we think is a weirdo...

01:06:04.975 --> 01:06:08.807
...because he doesn't share
our sense of ironic detachment.

01:06:09.229 --> 01:06:13.062
-All this hip, snide, smart-alecky...
-Bullshit?

01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:14.609
Yes, bullshit.

01:06:15.235 --> 01:06:19.530
Well, in a few moments,
I'll put on my Versace overcoat...

01:06:19.615 --> 01:06:23.315
...get into my Mercedes,
drive to my Fifth Avenue apartment...

01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:26.660
...and squeeze my girlfriend's
big, fake boobs.

01:06:27.331 --> 01:06:31.163
And that bullshit you're talking about
paid for all of it.

01:06:31.835 --> 01:06:34.920
Good for you, Mac. But I'm still telling him.

01:06:35.339 --> 01:06:36.370
Well...

01:06:38.134 --> 01:06:40.007
Babe Bennett falls in love.

01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:43.961
I'm happy for you. I am.

01:06:45.266 --> 01:06:46.843
Gonna miss you, Babe.

01:06:47.685 --> 01:06:49.095
Something fierce.

01:07:18.382 --> 01:07:20.209
You think she'll like this?

01:07:20.718 --> 01:07:21.832
All right.

01:07:21.969 --> 01:07:25.219
Chicken parmesan? Terrific, thank you.

01:07:25.973 --> 01:07:27.218
Let's hear it.

01:07:30.519 --> 01:07:33.141
-She gonna like that, Mr. Deeds.
-Okay.

01:07:33.981 --> 01:07:36.389
-Emilio, it looks beautiful.
-Thank you.

01:07:40.112 --> 01:07:43.446
These roses might be a little too high.
I won't be able to see her.

01:07:43.532 --> 01:07:45.655
-Do we have anything smaller?
-Yes, sir.

01:07:45.743 --> 01:07:46.739
Okay.

01:07:47.661 --> 01:07:48.657
Byron?

01:07:49.413 --> 01:07:50.788
That's terrific.

01:07:51.248 --> 01:07:54.083
-Would you mind sitting for a second?
-Yes, sir.

01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:58.626
Say something to me. Pretend you're her.

01:07:58.714 --> 01:08:00.753
-Me, sir?
-Please.

01:08:01.759 --> 01:08:02.754
Well...

01:08:03.969 --> 01:08:07.801
...it's nice of you to have invited me
to dine with you this evening.

01:08:07.890 --> 01:08:09.384
It's my pleasure.

01:08:09.516 --> 01:08:12.352
Actually, you're too tall.
Can you slink down?

01:08:14.188 --> 01:08:15.848
-Like this?
-That's good.

01:08:16.607 --> 01:08:20.106
This is one of the best dates
I've ever been on.

01:08:21.111 --> 01:08:23.104
You make me feel very special.

01:08:23.988 --> 01:08:26.196
You make me feel very special, too.

01:08:26.867 --> 01:08:28.859
That's why I got this for you.

01:08:29.703 --> 01:08:31.197
Okay, lean forward.

01:08:36.126 --> 01:08:39.292
-I really like you a lot.
-I like you, too.

01:08:39.587 --> 01:08:43.288
-I can't stop thinking about you.
-I can't stop thinking about you.

01:08:43.384 --> 01:08:45.376
Please let me touch your feet.

01:08:45.928 --> 01:08:48.845
Okay, this is getting weird.
You can stand up now.

01:08:52.017 --> 01:08:53.975
-Deeds!
-Fellows!

01:08:54.478 --> 01:08:57.313
We wanted to come and wish you
the best on your big night.

01:08:57.397 --> 01:09:01.478
Thanks a lot. I'm so nervous.
I never asked anybody to marry me before.

01:09:01.652 --> 01:09:04.189
It's 7:30, time for Inside Access.

01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:07.067
We're not in for any more
nasty surprises, are we?

01:09:07.158 --> 01:09:10.906
I don't think so. I haven't done
anything stupid all day. I've been here.

01:09:10.995 --> 01:09:15.122
Let's see what lame show they put on
when they don't have Deeds to pick on.

01:09:15.207 --> 01:09:16.618
Excuse me!

01:09:17.584 --> 01:09:21.167
-Could you put on Channel 8, please?
-You got it.

01:09:23.716 --> 01:09:26.385
Welcome to Inside Access.
I'm Mac McGrath.

01:09:27.136 --> 01:09:31.002
All of us here at I.A. take pride
in our ability to handle...

01:09:31.098 --> 01:09:33.671
...every story with sensitivity and empathy...

01:09:33.768 --> 01:09:34.514
Okay, pal.

01:09:34.602 --> 01:09:37.471
...while maintaining
an appropriate journalistic distance.

01:09:37.563 --> 01:09:42.106
But what happens when a reporter
becomes part of what she's reporting?

01:09:42.192 --> 01:09:46.060
What happens when a journalist
falls in love with an idiot?

01:09:47.281 --> 01:09:49.319
That's Longfellow Deeds with Pam Dawson.

01:09:49.617 --> 01:09:52.533
-I can't believe they involved her in this.
-A school nurse...

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:56.238
...who recently moved to New York City
from Winchestertonfieldville, lowa.

01:09:56.332 --> 01:10:00.199
But wait. Doesn't Pam Dawson
bear a striking resemblance to...

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:03.711
...Babe Bennett,
a producer here at Inside Access?

01:10:04.048 --> 01:10:06.717
In fact, the two are one and the same.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:10.584
We'll wire your apartment
with state-of-the-art surveillance video.

01:10:11.097 --> 01:10:12.377
Sounds good.

01:10:13.391 --> 01:10:14.386
Deeds.

01:10:21.398 --> 01:10:24.399
I came here to try to explain.

01:10:53.681 --> 01:10:55.922
I'm the biggest sucker in the world.

01:10:56.767 --> 01:10:58.427
This town can be brutal.

01:10:58.978 --> 01:11:00.520
I don't belong here.

01:11:00.646 --> 01:11:03.600
I can't run the company,
I can't even run my own life.

01:11:03.691 --> 01:11:06.264
Sure you can.
The good news is the papers are ready.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.942
Once you sign them, we'll get our stock
and you'll get your $40 billion.

01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:13.115
I don't want that money.
Just give it to a charity.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.949
-What's a good charity?
-The United Negro College Fund?

01:11:17.288 --> 01:11:19.197
Okay, give it to those guys.

01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:28.584
Can we give you a ride to the airport?
The company chopper will take you home.

01:11:28.674 --> 01:11:31.379
Thanks, anyway. I'll be all right on my own.

01:11:32.219 --> 01:11:35.054
-Nice meeting you all.
-Nice meeting you, Deeds.

01:11:38.684 --> 01:11:39.763
Goodbye!

01:11:41.645 --> 01:11:42.676
Goodbye.

01:12:27.566 --> 01:12:28.846
It's not right.

01:12:29.401 --> 01:12:30.682
It's not right.

01:12:57.846 --> 01:12:59.922
You must be Jan. My name is...

01:13:00.015 --> 01:13:03.219
I know who you are. Wham-bam Dawson.

01:13:04.353 --> 01:13:06.393
A.k.a. Little Miss Slut-Slut.

01:13:07.690 --> 01:13:09.766
Okay, I deserve that.

01:13:09.858 --> 01:13:12.101
Do you have any idea
how much you hurt him?

01:13:12.194 --> 01:13:14.401
You're not getting anywhere near that boy.

01:13:14.488 --> 01:13:18.356
I have to find him and there's nothing
you can do to stop me.

01:13:19.952 --> 01:13:24.164
-There's a lot I can do to stop you.
-He needs to know how bad I feel.

01:13:24.707 --> 01:13:27.198
And that I would go to the end of the earth...

01:13:27.292 --> 01:13:31.160
...I would do anything
to take back what I did to him.

01:13:31.255 --> 01:13:35.003
I'm sorry, all I heard was,
"Blah, blah, I'm a dirty tramp."

01:13:36.677 --> 01:13:38.884
Tell you what. You get by me...

01:13:40.973 --> 01:13:42.930
...l'll tell you where he is.

01:13:49.022 --> 01:13:50.351
Feeling crazy!

01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:54.438
Come to Mama.

01:14:00.868 --> 01:14:05.495
I was a rodeo clown for six years.
You'll have to step it up a notch, shorty.

01:14:05.581 --> 01:14:07.123
You mean like this?

01:14:11.545 --> 01:14:14.795
Where were you kicking?
I ain't got no balls, dummy!

01:14:15.632 --> 01:14:16.628
Get up!

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.836
-Put me down!
-You got it!

01:14:24.267 --> 01:14:27.766
-Just tell me where Deeds is.
-Bring your bony ass over here.

01:14:28.770 --> 01:14:32.471
I want to cut you into
eight slices of bitch-eroni.

01:14:46.539 --> 01:14:47.997
Are you all right?

01:14:48.916 --> 01:14:51.205
Good kick, honey. Good kick.

01:14:55.047 --> 01:14:56.245
Crazy Eyes!

01:15:03.806 --> 01:15:05.514
-All right.
-Here you go.

01:15:06.141 --> 01:15:08.549
Peanut butter and gumballs. Nice combo.

01:15:08.644 --> 01:15:11.811
Don't worry about what happened.
Time heals all things.

01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:14.648
Except these crazy eyes.

01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:17.642
It's good to be home. I know that much.

01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:22.233
I wasn't talking to you, Deeds.
I was talking to that squirrel over there.

01:15:24.201 --> 01:15:26.573
Although it's a shame
about that Cedar fellow...

01:15:26.662 --> 01:15:30.161
...tearing apart your uncle's company
and firing all those nice people.

01:15:30.249 --> 01:15:31.280
Where'd you hear that?

01:15:31.375 --> 01:15:33.948
I watch the stock market channel
all the time.

01:15:34.044 --> 01:15:38.125
I watch because I suspect that anchorman
of being an evil leprechaun.

01:15:38.215 --> 01:15:40.676
He can bullshit everybody else,
but he ain't fooling me.

01:15:40.676 --> 01:15:41.423
He can bullshit everybody else,
but he ain't fooling me.

01:15:45.431 --> 01:15:46.759
There it is.

01:15:56.275 --> 01:15:57.270
Someone!

01:15:57.693 --> 01:15:58.772
Help!

01:16:04.575 --> 01:16:06.449
Deeds! Help!

01:16:07.995 --> 01:16:10.118
Deeds! Help!

01:16:10.206 --> 01:16:11.914
Oh, God! Deeds!

01:16:23.135 --> 01:16:24.463
Oh, my God!

01:16:33.604 --> 01:16:36.142
Where do you got the camera hidden,
in the woods?

01:16:36.232 --> 01:16:37.394
No camera.

01:16:37.483 --> 01:16:39.974
I'm so cold. Please!

01:16:40.235 --> 01:16:42.359
You gonna get mugged in there, too?

01:16:42.446 --> 01:16:43.644
I'm so...

01:16:44.656 --> 01:16:45.736
...sorry.

01:16:45.824 --> 01:16:48.825
I really love you.

01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:51.199
Bullshit!

01:17:16.897 --> 01:17:18.060
I'm coming!

01:17:20.526 --> 01:17:23.195
Go down! Go down!

01:17:23.278 --> 01:17:25.187
Here comes the black foot.

01:17:27.199 --> 01:17:28.195
No!

01:17:31.912 --> 01:17:34.201
I know it's gross, but grab it.

01:17:38.794 --> 01:17:40.917
I got you. I got you.

01:17:41.088 --> 01:17:45.797
-Oh, God, your foot is disgusting!
-I know, I know. Come here.

01:17:46.427 --> 01:17:49.048
Come on, you okay? You okay?

01:17:49.597 --> 01:17:50.841
I think so.

01:17:54.518 --> 01:17:57.602
You didn't really fall out of an apple tree,
did you?

01:17:59.356 --> 01:18:00.352
No.

01:18:02.985 --> 01:18:04.609
But I really love you.

01:18:06.613 --> 01:18:08.736
I don't even know who you are.

01:18:09.825 --> 01:18:11.105
I'm sorry.

01:18:37.687 --> 01:18:39.513
I am so sorry.

01:18:47.530 --> 01:18:51.942
A company in tatters. Preston Blake's
great legacy gone to the highest bidder.

01:18:52.034 --> 01:18:55.984
The shocking announcement from Chuck
Cedar today confirmed that Blake Media...

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.950
...will be stripped down
and sold off piece by piece.

01:18:59.041 --> 01:19:02.457
The only man who could stand up
to Mr. Cedar and save the company...

01:19:02.544 --> 01:19:07.087
...Longfellow Deeds, has apparently
given up his voting rights and left the city.

01:19:07.591 --> 01:19:10.260
The sale's expected to pass
with unanimous consent...

01:19:10.344 --> 01:19:14.556
...at the annual stockholders' meeting
here in New York tomorrow afternoon.

01:19:14.724 --> 01:19:18.306
Sources indicate that virtually
all of Blake's 50, 000 employees...

01:19:18.394 --> 01:19:20.850
...are likely to lose their jobs.

01:19:20.938 --> 01:19:23.263
Wait a minute. I'm a Blake employee.

01:19:23.732 --> 01:19:26.520
Holy shit! This sucks.

01:19:27.611 --> 01:19:31.395
Ladies and gentlemen,
the bottom line is that this divestiture...

01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:36.484
...will result in every shareholder,
all of you and myself included...

01:19:36.912 --> 01:19:39.866
...getting a substantial premium
for our shares.

01:19:41.708 --> 01:19:45.327
But before we vote, the company bylaws
require me to open the floor...

01:19:45.421 --> 01:19:49.501
...to shareholders for statements
either for or against this buyout plan.

01:19:49.592 --> 01:19:51.917
Does anyone wish to make a statement?

01:19:52.178 --> 01:19:55.760
Dismantling this company
would be an insult to a great man.

01:19:56.599 --> 01:19:57.844
You scared me.

01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:02.264
It is an unspeakable outrage
and it cannot be allowed to happen.

01:20:06.108 --> 01:20:08.266
Excuse me. I got a statement.

01:20:11.072 --> 01:20:12.614
Longfellow Deeds.

01:20:12.698 --> 01:20:15.616
Unfortunately, since you sold me
your 300 million shares...

01:20:15.701 --> 01:20:19.201
-...you've no right to speak at this meeting.
-Unfortunately for you...

01:20:19.288 --> 01:20:22.040
...I bought one share of Blake Media
this morning.

01:20:22.124 --> 01:20:25.160
You told me every stockholder
has a say in this company.

01:20:25.252 --> 01:20:26.794
Even the little guy.

01:20:29.131 --> 01:20:33.544
You have two minutes, but remember,
I control 49 percent of this company.

01:20:33.635 --> 01:20:36.720
You're gonna have to persuade
just about everyone else...

01:20:36.805 --> 01:20:38.549
...to start hating money.

01:20:46.106 --> 01:20:48.313
Hello, everybody. I'm Deeds.

01:20:49.192 --> 01:20:52.312
For a little while,
I was a big part of this company.

01:20:52.905 --> 01:20:55.146
I was wicked rich and powerful.

01:20:55.949 --> 01:20:58.654
Now being rich and powerful
isn't a bad thing.

01:20:59.829 --> 01:21:04.075
It looks like the Monopoly guy over there
is pretty darned psyched about it.

01:21:04.791 --> 01:21:07.793
But the problem is
what can happen when you decide...

01:21:07.878 --> 01:21:12.255
...that you would do absolutely anything
to become rich and powerful.

01:21:12.341 --> 01:21:15.176
I don't know who licked the red off
your lollipop today...

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:17.834
...but you are preaching to the wrong choir.

01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:20.088
All I'm saying is, when you were kids...

01:21:20.182 --> 01:21:23.551
...did you dream
about becoming a savvy investor one day...

01:21:23.644 --> 01:21:26.847
...who would think with his wallet
instead of his heart?

01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:29.517
Come on, I know I didn't.

01:21:30.025 --> 01:21:31.769
I wanted to be a fireman.

01:21:32.569 --> 01:21:36.270
I wanted to be the guy everybody called on
if they were in trouble.

01:21:36.365 --> 01:21:37.943
I wanted to help people...

01:21:38.034 --> 01:21:41.616
...and yeah, I wanted to slide down
those wicked awesome poles.

01:21:42.538 --> 01:21:45.954
But money,
that was the last thing I thought about.

01:21:46.917 --> 01:21:50.001
What about you, sir?
Did you want to be a fireman?

01:21:50.087 --> 01:21:51.416
No, I did not.

01:21:52.965 --> 01:21:55.207
Truth be told, I wanted to be a veterinarian.

01:21:55.301 --> 01:21:57.756
Cool. Why would you want to do that?

01:21:58.637 --> 01:22:01.757
-I wanted to help sick animals.
-And what do you do now?

01:22:01.849 --> 01:22:04.007
I own a chain of slaughterhouses.

01:22:04.268 --> 01:22:07.435
You kind of went the other way
on that one, didn't you?

01:22:08.230 --> 01:22:09.096
Okay.

01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:11.763
In the back. Come on.
Tell me what you wanted to be.

01:22:11.859 --> 01:22:14.065
I wanted to be a magician.

01:22:15.696 --> 01:22:19.741
-And what do you do now?
-I operate a pornographic website.

01:22:20.451 --> 01:22:24.531
That makes people happy also, I guess.
But kind of in a grosser way.

01:22:25.831 --> 01:22:28.156
-Who else?
-I wanted to be a senator.

01:22:28.667 --> 01:22:32.535
-I wanted to be a florist.
-lnternational House Pancake.

01:22:33.046 --> 01:22:34.707
I wanted to be a man.

01:22:36.884 --> 01:22:38.710
That explains a lot.

01:22:39.303 --> 01:22:41.544
I wanted to be a Ping-Pong champion.

01:22:44.391 --> 01:22:47.511
But you're not those things
you wanted to be, are you?

01:22:47.728 --> 01:22:51.512
Everybody made a compromise,
then another compromise, and now...

01:22:51.607 --> 01:22:56.518
...you're about to put 50, 000 people out
of work to make a quick buck? Come on.

01:22:56.821 --> 01:23:00.355
I bet if we ran into the 6th-grade versions
of ourselves right now...

01:23:00.449 --> 01:23:03.485
...they would kick our asses
and put Bubble Yum in our hair...

01:23:03.577 --> 01:23:05.949
...for even thinking about doing this.

01:23:07.915 --> 01:23:10.666
He's right.
I would've beat my greedy ass red.

01:23:10.751 --> 01:23:13.076
I would've thrown myself
off the merry-go-round.

01:23:13.170 --> 01:23:17.631
I would've tied myself naked to a chair
and burned myself with lit cigarettes.

01:23:19.093 --> 01:23:22.010
Did anyone here dream
of becoming a psychiatrist?

01:23:22.137 --> 01:23:23.596
Just kidding, pal.

01:23:24.306 --> 01:23:27.093
There's still hope
for the kids inside of all of us.

01:23:27.184 --> 01:23:29.722
Please don't break up my uncle's company.

01:23:32.022 --> 01:23:33.849
I always wanted to do that.

01:23:44.493 --> 01:23:45.489
Well...

01:23:46.579 --> 01:23:48.080
...that was very touching, Deeds.

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:48.744
...that was very touching, Deeds.

01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:52.291
It appears this divestiture
has been defeated.

01:23:52.459 --> 01:23:54.535
Unless I'm forgetting something.

01:23:55.796 --> 01:23:57.374
My 300 million votes...

01:23:57.464 --> 01:24:01.378
...plus the 5 million votes I control
as proxy for the foreign investors.

01:24:01.469 --> 01:24:04.006
So which way should I vote my 51 percent?

01:24:05.389 --> 01:24:06.634
I vote aye.

01:24:07.058 --> 01:24:09.264
305 million times.

01:24:10.561 --> 01:24:14.310
The ayes have it.
And Blake Media is no more.

01:24:14.398 --> 01:24:16.189
Not so fast, Chuck.

01:24:17.610 --> 01:24:20.895
Too bad for you, when I was a kid,
I wanted to be a good reporter.

01:24:20.988 --> 01:24:23.740
Miss Bennett,
I wasn't aware you were a stockholder.

01:24:23.824 --> 01:24:25.947
There's a couple things you're not aware of.

01:24:26.034 --> 01:24:28.572
How to tweeze your eyebrows, for instance.

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:33.623
Also, when Deeds gave away his fortune,
he gave away something that wasn't his.

01:24:35.043 --> 01:24:39.504
-What are you talking about?
-I have here the diary of Preston Blake.

01:24:42.384 --> 01:24:43.795
I stole it and read it.

01:24:43.886 --> 01:24:47.468
Please don't be mad at me.
I did it for good reasons, I promise.

01:24:47.556 --> 01:24:50.723
I would like to read a passage
from Mr. Blake's diary...

01:24:50.810 --> 01:24:53.348
...dated April 12, 1957.

01:24:54.354 --> 01:24:56.644
"I am a volcano of lust.

01:24:56.774 --> 01:25:00.522
"I've gotten this far in business
by following my heart.

01:25:01.028 --> 01:25:02.937
"And I must follow it now...

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:04.692
"...in love.

01:25:06.408 --> 01:25:09.860
"If she just gives me a sign, an opening."

01:25:10.246 --> 01:25:13.531
Want me to wipe the leaves
on your ficus tree, Mr. Blake?

01:25:14.708 --> 01:25:16.452
You can call me Preston.

01:25:18.504 --> 01:25:22.204
Want me to wipe the leaves
on your ficus tree, Preston?

01:25:23.884 --> 01:25:24.880
Yes.

01:25:27.054 --> 01:25:28.050
Yes.

01:25:28.931 --> 01:25:29.927
Yes!

01:25:31.142 --> 01:25:33.050
Who was this mystery woman?

01:25:33.269 --> 01:25:37.895
I have here the Blake Media ledger
sign-in book from April, 1957.

01:25:38.565 --> 01:25:43.643
On the night of the 12th, there was
only one woman working on Blake's floor.

01:25:44.071 --> 01:25:48.567
Sadly, nine months later, she died,
giving birth to a son.

01:25:49.118 --> 01:25:50.612
A son born...

01:25:50.911 --> 01:25:53.829
...January 23, 1958.

01:25:54.582 --> 01:25:56.124
That is my birthday.

01:25:56.250 --> 01:25:58.408
To Miss Consuela Lopez.

01:25:59.002 --> 01:26:00.414
That is my mother.

01:26:00.587 --> 01:26:03.423
And the rightful heir to $40 billion!

01:26:03.841 --> 01:26:05.335
That is my money?

01:26:05.551 --> 01:26:08.006
A simple DNA test will show...

01:26:08.137 --> 01:26:12.217
...that Emilio Lopez is
the majority stockholder to Blake Media.

01:26:12.433 --> 01:26:14.591
-lt is my money!
-That's your money!

01:26:14.769 --> 01:26:16.263
That is my money!

01:26:17.896 --> 01:26:19.355
Way to go, Emilio!

01:26:19.565 --> 01:26:21.937
I will do good things for everyone.

01:26:22.317 --> 01:26:24.560
Free flamenco lessons for all.

01:26:24.653 --> 01:26:26.729
People, people! Please!

01:26:26.906 --> 01:26:30.405
-That is my money.
-Don't be misled. These are all lies.

01:26:30.701 --> 01:26:31.981
Mr. Cedar...

01:26:32.786 --> 01:26:34.197
...you are fired.

01:26:34.413 --> 01:26:36.156
You can't fire me!

01:26:36.749 --> 01:26:38.208
I'm in control!

01:26:38.583 --> 01:26:40.162
Get your hands off me! I'm Chuck Cedar!

01:26:40.752 --> 01:26:42.496
At the lake, when you saved my life...

01:26:42.588 --> 01:26:45.458
...which I never got a chance
to properly thank you for...

01:26:45.549 --> 01:26:48.041
-You're welcome.
-You said you didn't know who I was.

01:26:48.135 --> 01:26:50.708
And it made me realize
I don't know who I am.

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:54.090
So I started working on it
and here's what I got so far.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:58.051
My name is Babe Bennett.
I grew up in Syossett, Long Island.

01:26:58.187 --> 01:27:02.231
I have brown eyes and I don't know
what my natural hair colour is anymore.

01:27:02.608 --> 01:27:05.728
When I was in 5th grade,
I got a crush on Walter Cronkite.

01:27:05.819 --> 01:27:09.438
I really did have that Holly Hobby notebook
I was telling you about.

01:27:09.532 --> 01:27:13.612
I love Bruce Springsteen, Almond Roca
and Abbott and Costello movies.

01:27:13.828 --> 01:27:16.034
I don't like liquorice or my ankles.

01:27:16.455 --> 01:27:19.622
More importantly,
I know that I messed up real bad.

01:27:19.791 --> 01:27:22.792
And I'd be willing to spend
the rest of my life...

01:27:22.878 --> 01:27:25.250
...begging you to give me another chance...

01:27:25.339 --> 01:27:28.043
...because I am so deeply in love with you...

01:27:28.759 --> 01:27:32.175
...and I know it's definitely
that forever kind of love...

01:27:32.262 --> 01:27:33.591
You're crazy.

01:27:36.016 --> 01:27:37.808
You have beautiful ankles.

01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:49.529
Let's go home.

01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:54.742
You're fired! You! You!

01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:57.526
Oh, you, sir. You are definitely fired.

01:27:58.164 --> 01:28:03.205
I'd like to stay. I think I can really do
some good if I just got another chance.

01:28:06.922 --> 01:28:10.967
Not fired. But tomorrow morning,
you let me change your socks.

01:28:12.595 --> 01:28:13.590
Okay.

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:18.008
And you, Long-Long-Longfellow...

01:28:18.267 --> 01:28:21.552
...you are the one
who made all this possible...

01:28:21.645 --> 01:28:24.812
...with your beautiful words
and your beautiful spirit.

01:28:24.982 --> 01:28:27.769
And Miss Bennett,
with her beautiful research.

01:28:28.319 --> 01:28:29.861
How can I thank you?

01:28:30.154 --> 01:28:33.439
All I want is your friendship, Emilio.
You're a good man.

01:28:34.575 --> 01:28:35.773
I'll miss you.

01:28:37.077 --> 01:28:38.073
Deeds!

01:28:39.496 --> 01:28:42.332
-How about $1 billion?
-All right.

01:28:42.875 --> 01:28:43.788
Done.

01:28:56.638 --> 01:28:57.718
Holy Jeez!

01:28:58.516 --> 01:28:59.974
I can't believe it!

01:29:00.559 --> 01:29:03.015
-What's that?
-A letter from Hallmark.

01:29:03.104 --> 01:29:05.595
They're actually going to buy
one of my cards.

01:29:05.689 --> 01:29:09.770
-My gosh! Which one?
-The one I wrote for you, remember it?

01:29:10.319 --> 01:29:11.729
Do I remember?

01:29:12.404 --> 01:29:15.240
"Hard to breathe, feels like floating

01:29:15.741 --> 01:29:18.362
"So full of love my heart's exploding

01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:21.655
"Mouth is dry, hands are shaking

01:29:22.081 --> 01:29:24.370
"My heart is yours for the taking

01:29:24.833 --> 01:29:27.123
"Acting weird, not myself

01:29:27.586 --> 01:29:30.208
"Dancing around like the Keebler elf

01:29:30.505 --> 01:29:33.590
"Finally time for this poor schlub

01:29:35.010 --> 01:29:38.177
"To know how it feels to fall in lub"

01:29:38.764 --> 01:29:40.306
I'm so proud of you!

01:29:46.146 --> 01:29:48.898
Can you believe Deeds bought us all these?

01:29:53.487 --> 01:29:55.396
Damn, these things are fast!

01:29:59.701 --> 01:30:00.982
I'm okay!

01:30:02.037 --> 01:30:03.117
I'm okay!

01:30:04.305 --> 01:30:10.448
