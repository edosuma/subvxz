[theme music playing]

02:07.001 --> 02:10.171
[indistinct chatter]

02:13.049 --> 02:14.425
[woman] I love that color on her.

02:14.509 --> 02:15.844
[woman 2] It looks really good.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.555
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.940
Oh, sorry. Yeah.

02:29.023 --> 02:31.192
-We talked about it.
-Honey, just have a seat.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.778
All right. Thank you, dear.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.124
I'll be-- I'll be right back.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.417
Okay?

02:48.626 --> 02:51.254
Okay, but, like, Teagan needs it this big.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.388
How are you holding up?

03:01.139 --> 03:01.973
Shaky.

03:03.558 --> 03:04.976
You gonna do the toast?

03:05.059 --> 03:09.731
I don't know. I'm getting
some serious glare and stare action.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.649
Mm. Tell me about it.

03:12.191 --> 03:14.736
One of the groomsmen hit on me. [laughs]

03:14.819 --> 03:17.071
And the drunk uncle
asked if I still had a penis.

03:18.281 --> 03:21.701
Well, at least we live in one of the most
progressive cities in the world.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.453
I know.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.539
I think it might be time for me
to get a headache

03:26.623 --> 03:28.875
-and bow out like the coward I am.
-Mm-hmm.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.007
-CBM incoming.
-Oh, God.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.012
-Michael.
-Janet.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.640
I don't want to make a scene here.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.434
Why not? I have some great ideas.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.186
I know Teagan asked you to speak,

03:48.269 --> 03:51.439
but if you have any compassion
for your sister or this family,

03:52.232 --> 03:54.525
I really think it would be best
for everyone

03:54.609 --> 03:58.655
if you had one of your mysterious
headaches and left early.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.033
Just consider it.

04:02.742 --> 04:03.576
Please.

04:07.830 --> 04:10.250
[Nomi exhales]

04:11.084 --> 04:14.212
Well... you gotta do it now.

04:16.297 --> 04:17.298
[glasses clink]

04:24.806 --> 04:26.432
[exhales]

04:29.352 --> 04:30.186
Is this working?

04:30.270 --> 04:31.771
[feedback]

04:32.438 --> 04:36.693
My name is Nomi.
I am Teagan's only sibling,

04:36.776 --> 04:40.655
which means, yes,
I am her former brother-now-sister.

04:41.864 --> 04:44.409
This may come as a surprise
to some of you.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.912
I'm a subject my parents prefer to avoid.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.498
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

04:52.875 --> 04:57.046
As someone not usually invited
to these family functions,

04:57.130 --> 05:00.550
I admit that, for a long time,

05:00.633 --> 05:02.760
I related the idea of family
to Nietzsche's

05:02.844 --> 05:05.179
"That which does not kill you
makes you stronger."

05:06.389 --> 05:09.309
But I don't think that way
about family anymore.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.020
And that's largely due
to my sister Teagan.

05:13.855 --> 05:18.109
So, let me tell you
a little bit about her.

05:18.192 --> 05:19.402
Dirt! We want the dirt!

05:19.485 --> 05:21.362
[laughter]

05:22.739 --> 05:27.035
Everybody thinks Teagan is really nice,
but it's not true.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.286
She isn't nice.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.747
She's super nice.

05:30.830 --> 05:35.001
-[laughter]
-Like, sickeningly nice.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.836
She was born a vegetarian.

05:38.546 --> 05:43.760
I remember her apologizing
before eating french fries

05:43.843 --> 05:46.262
because they were related
to Mr. Potato Head.

05:47.388 --> 05:51.851
And, yes, she did go to Greece
to help Syrian refugees.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.772
It was hard being Teagan's sibling...

05:56.898 --> 05:59.150
because she was so perfect.

06:00.109 --> 06:03.529
She was smart, and funny, and pretty.

06:04.238 --> 06:06.908
Bluebirds followed her to school.

06:08.826 --> 06:12.163
I, on the other hand, was the opposite.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.248
I was the difficult one.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.667
I was troubled.

06:16.751 --> 06:20.296
I remember an early therapy session
with my mother

06:20.379 --> 06:23.257
where we were just screaming
at each other until she blurted out,

06:23.341 --> 06:25.426
"Why can't you be more like Teagan?"

06:26.969 --> 06:28.346
Be careful what you wish for, Mom.

06:32.266 --> 06:35.311
Teagan and I got into huge fights, too.

06:36.521 --> 06:39.107
I know I was trying to provoke her.

06:39.190 --> 06:42.276
I once tore up her diary.

06:43.402 --> 06:50.243
I wanted her to get angry,
to feel depressed, to have a fit.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.246
To be more like me.

06:55.206 --> 07:01.045
The worst fight we ever had
was just before my operation.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.422
She came to my apartment.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.801
I think, like most cisgendered people,

07:06.884 --> 07:10.888
she didn't understand
why I had to have surgery.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.765
She was scared for me.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.519
I think a small part of her
wanted to talk me out of it.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.813
And then she found out

07:18.896 --> 07:23.151
I had forged my mother's signature
on the medical consent forms...

07:24.068 --> 07:27.572
and we both realized
she now had the power to stop me.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.991
I got scared.

07:31.033 --> 07:36.038
I said some pretty terrible things
that I regretted as soon as I said them.

07:36.622 --> 07:41.794
She left and I wondered if that was it,
if our relationship was over.

07:42.879 --> 07:46.340
The night before I went into the hospital

07:46.424 --> 07:50.261
was the longest and the loneliest
I've ever felt in my life.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.891
But no one stopped me.

07:56.434 --> 07:57.435
When I woke up...

07:58.311 --> 08:04.192
the first thing I felt
was Teagan's hand holding mine.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.111
Her smile was the first thing I saw.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.074
And her voice singing "Happy Birthday"...

08:12.158 --> 08:16.412
♪ Happy Birthday, dear Nomi ♪

08:16.496 --> 08:18.539
[Nomi] ...was the first thing I heard.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.588
It was in that moment...

08:27.507 --> 08:32.053
my sister taught me
what "family" actually means.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.976
So, Tom...

08:40.520 --> 08:42.563
treat my sister well,

08:43.189 --> 08:44.732
because if you don't...

08:45.983 --> 08:47.944
-I swear I...
-...will find you.

08:51.155 --> 08:52.823
To Teagan.

08:52.907 --> 08:56.327
The best sister anyone could hope for.
I love you.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.330
-And I wish you and Tom all the best.
-[mouthing words]

09:01.249 --> 09:03.501
[applause]

09:13.761 --> 09:16.264
I would totally wear this
if it came in my size.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.515
[chuckles]

09:19.016 --> 09:21.769
I can't believe she's already
having her third child.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.479
It's wonderful.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.439
And she's a year younger than you, Kala.

09:25.523 --> 09:26.941
Why did she bother going to university

09:27.024 --> 09:28.818
if all she was going to do
was make babies?

09:28.901 --> 09:30.361
-[Priya] Kala.
-What?

09:30.444 --> 09:32.697
She was one of the top students.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.116
It's a complete waste of resource
for a mind like her.

09:35.199 --> 09:38.369
She shouldn't be at home...
changing diapers.

09:38.452 --> 09:41.414
She should be solving, like,
global warming.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.083
-Such a way of thinking you have.
-Am I wrong?

09:44.166 --> 09:48.170
She's your friend. She's discovering
her life the same as you are.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.047
And she looks happy when I see her.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.882
[Priya] Of course she's happy.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.634
She has a husband she loves.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.803
And both of them together
are making a family,

09:55.886 --> 09:57.972
which is the most natural thing
in the world.

09:58.055 --> 10:00.099
I'm not saying it's not natural.

10:00.182 --> 10:02.810
Though, let us remember that cancer
is also natural,

10:02.893 --> 10:05.813
so naturalness in itself
should not be considered a virtue.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.858
I'm just suggesting that there are
better uses for a mind like hers.

10:08.941 --> 10:15.072
Well, let's wait and see what you think
once you and Rajan start having children.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.159
[soft laughter]

10:18.242 --> 10:19.619
I need a coffee.

10:19.702 --> 10:20.995
I'll meet you outside.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.516
[gasps]

12:06.308 --> 12:07.435
Fuck.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.189
Great. I just pissed myself.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.236
[panting] Sorry.

12:17.319 --> 12:20.406
Fuck, man. I've been looking
all over this fucking city for you.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.036
I needed to lay low.

12:28.539 --> 12:31.041
-I figured it was bad.
-Why?

12:31.625 --> 12:33.544
I'm not the only one looking.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.256
-Cops?
-Mm-hmm.

12:37.339 --> 12:38.174
Fuchs?

12:38.924 --> 12:39.758
Yeah.

12:41.719 --> 12:46.849
Keeps calling, like...
one of your old girlfriends.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.645
What happened?

12:57.818 --> 13:00.654
-It's not good.
-Gah!

13:01.113 --> 13:05.075
When you say "not good," usually means
stuff's going to start blowing up

13:05.159 --> 13:06.702
and people will start dying.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.831
Maybe it's time for me to leave this town.

13:14.376 --> 13:15.211
India plan.

13:17.421 --> 13:18.547
Maybe.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.303
[Priya] Is everything all right
between you and Rajan?

13:25.971 --> 13:27.431
Why would you ask that?

13:28.265 --> 13:29.975
Because you're my daughter.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.982
Rajan and I are...

13:38.192 --> 13:40.653
We're not exactly...

13:40.736 --> 13:45.699
Well, there are things that we did not
know about each other that we are...

13:46.951 --> 13:48.160
processing.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.044
You know, Bitta...

13:58.462 --> 14:01.131
when your father
first brought me to Bombay...

14:02.216 --> 14:04.385
I was terrified of these streets.

14:06.804 --> 14:10.015
I remember the first time I went out,
I got lost.

14:11.308 --> 14:14.144
It was so different from where I grew up.

14:15.062 --> 14:17.439
So busy and noisy.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.109
Nobody knew anybody.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.613
I thought I wouldn't be safe
and comfortable here.

14:27.157 --> 14:33.122
One day, he asked me to get a few things
for his restaurant, and I couldn't do it.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.375
I had to pay a boy to get them for me.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.296
I hid in the doorway and waited for them.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.716
I didn't tell this to your dad.
I was too ashamed.

14:45.759 --> 14:48.846
You know, Kala, sometimes...

14:50.973 --> 14:54.518
all we need is... a bit of time.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.318
[Riley] No. No.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.153
No.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.113
No.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.532
Wait. That's her.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.117
-You sure?
-Yeah.

15:11.994 --> 15:15.414
We found her.
Her name is Carol Cumberland.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.516
[doorbell buzzes]

15:52.409 --> 15:54.036
She was here.

15:55.496 --> 15:56.497
Angelica?

16:03.295 --> 16:04.254
With Whispers.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.299
Did you say "Whispers"?

16:08.550 --> 16:10.302
We're heading into some creepy house

16:10.386 --> 16:13.555
and you're talking about some guy
named Whispers? Seriously?

16:13.639 --> 16:15.432
He can wait in the car if he wants.

16:15.516 --> 16:19.269
I know he's probably saying some shit
like I can wait in the car, but I'm a cop.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.440
I was just shining a light
upon a situation

16:23.524 --> 16:26.276
that normal people in their normal lives
prefer to avoid.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.571
[knocking on door]

16:31.240 --> 16:32.241
No one's home.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.536
Which means Officer Gorski's
probably suggesting--

16:35.619 --> 16:36.787
Let's go around back.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.999
Yeah. Predictable.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.353
What have you gotten me into?

17:54.740 --> 17:56.658
[indistinct shouting]

18:45.207 --> 18:47.376
[panting]

18:49.628 --> 18:50.921
I don't want to hurt you.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.216
But I will
if you don't answer my questions.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.057
Mm-hmm.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.985
Little B and E. Sure. Why not?

19:13.485 --> 19:15.779
We're just officers of the law, right?

19:50.397 --> 19:52.983
[indistinct whispering]

19:53.066 --> 19:54.568
Angel and Raoul.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.154
Slow down.

19:57.237 --> 20:00.365
It's okay. Raoul, you can do it.
I got you. It's just some stairs.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.159
They went down there.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.623
[Diego] Hold on, hold on. Hey...

20:08.457 --> 20:09.708
I got this.

20:12.127 --> 20:15.214
-[Angelica] I got him.
-This way. Go through here.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.926
[Angelica] Come on. I got you.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.185
Yeah, great.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.800
I'll let you do your séance thing.
I'll stay back here.

20:59.883 --> 21:02.261
[indistinct whispering]

21:02.344 --> 21:03.679
[Todd] They can make us normal...

21:03.762 --> 21:06.056
[woman] She was searching
for her children.

21:07.599 --> 21:11.436
[overlapping whispering continues]

21:22.155 --> 21:23.699
[electrical buzzing]

21:26.159 --> 21:27.619
So much pain.

21:47.472 --> 21:50.017
[Angelica] The research might be helpful.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.435
They want to sterilize us.

21:53.687 --> 21:54.980
[screaming]

22:04.865 --> 22:06.700
[Diego] Everything all right?

22:11.872 --> 22:13.290
Hey, what are you doing?

22:38.982 --> 22:40.108
[Angelica] It's okay.

22:45.864 --> 22:49.159
[Angelica] You'll be safe. I'm sorry.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.506
Forgive me.

23:05.592 --> 23:06.676
Forgive me.

23:12.557 --> 23:13.975
I'm so sorry.

23:29.324 --> 23:30.242
That's fucking creepy.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.746
So to recap,
we got your standard mad scientist lab.

23:35.413 --> 23:36.748
Apparently abandoned.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.584
Still looking for evidence of a crime.

23:40.335 --> 23:41.795
[Riley] We should look upstairs.

23:42.712 --> 23:43.755
[Diego] Right.

23:46.508 --> 23:48.593
Let me guess, his idea.

25:07.130 --> 25:08.131
Fuck.

25:37.327 --> 25:40.872
[Silas] I know I'm going to win.
I can smell my victory.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.708
Oh, no.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.753
-Oh.
-Ha! Four in a row. I win again.

25:47.879 --> 25:48.922
[Amondi] Van Damn!

25:52.050 --> 25:53.468
It's good to see you, Amondi.

25:54.678 --> 25:57.013
Give us a moment, Amondi. Go with Martha.

25:57.097 --> 25:59.432
-You still have homework to do, huh?
-See you later.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.558
See you.

26:03.395 --> 26:07.857
If you do become president,
will you stop driving the Van Damn?

26:09.901 --> 26:10.735
Never.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.035
Come.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.464
What can I do for you, Van Damn?

26:36.678 --> 26:38.763
I want to know why your men
have been following me.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.181
Can I offer you a drink?

26:40.265 --> 26:43.184
-Oh. No, thank you.
-I'll have a bourbon.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.895
I should have told you about my men,

26:45.979 --> 26:48.315
but I knew if I did,
you would have said you didn't want them.

26:48.398 --> 26:49.607
I don't.

26:50.317 --> 26:53.028
Your friends at the KDRP
may know something about politics,

26:53.111 --> 26:54.946
but I know Nairobi.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.325
The true measure
of a candidate's viability in this city

26:58.408 --> 27:01.703
is not measured by polls or numbers.

27:01.786 --> 27:05.915
You know that someone is a serious
contender by the size of the bounty.

27:06.666 --> 27:07.709
There's a bounty on my head?

27:07.792 --> 27:10.587
There's a bounty on anyone
who runs against Mandiba.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.092
How serious is it?

27:16.801 --> 27:22.098
I would say now the price is somewhere
between a beating and a kidnapping.

27:23.224 --> 27:25.894
But let's see what happens
after your rally.

27:25.977 --> 27:28.229
This will tell us how dangerous
they think you are.

27:30.648 --> 27:32.901
Are you telling me
you think I should withdraw?

27:32.984 --> 27:35.111
Withdraw now and you will have done
the exact opposite

27:35.195 --> 27:36.821
of what you set out to do.

27:37.697 --> 27:42.035
Instead of undermining Mandiba's hold
over this city and his control of Kibera,

27:42.535 --> 27:45.914
your withdrawal will serve
to make him invincible.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.165
Then I can't withdraw.

27:48.041 --> 27:48.875
No.

27:48.958 --> 27:50.335
And I can't claim to be like everyone else

27:50.418 --> 27:53.713
if I have armed guards following me
everywhere I go.

27:54.214 --> 27:57.300
You are right to understand
that politics requires courage.

27:57.884 --> 28:01.679
But if you're asking for advice,
I would suggest you stop driving a bus

28:01.763 --> 28:04.849
where every day,
you arrive at the same appointed time.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.066
Will you answer a question honestly?

28:15.235 --> 28:17.028
As honestly as I can.

28:18.696 --> 28:21.950
Are you helping me because undermining
Mandiba's control over this city

28:22.033 --> 28:23.868
is good for your business interests?

28:27.288 --> 28:32.210
The easiest decisions in this world
are those where what is good for business

28:32.293 --> 28:33.795
is also good for your family.

28:35.255 --> 28:36.589
F-- Family?

28:36.673 --> 28:38.842
You know I'm deeply indebted.

28:39.467 --> 28:42.220
And you know my daughter cares
very much about you.

28:43.138 --> 28:48.476
But I must admit, I would never make
such a presumption based on this alone.

28:49.352 --> 28:51.020
You asked for honesty.

28:55.275 --> 28:56.735
I'm in love with your mother.

28:58.486 --> 29:01.239
And it is my intention
to ask her to marry me.

29:08.621 --> 29:11.249
[laughter]

29:18.047 --> 29:20.884
[Bug] We made it. I think we made it.
I think we made it.

29:27.348 --> 29:30.810
-[bell tolling]
-[organ playing]

29:30.894 --> 29:32.145
Oh, God.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.606
Who starts a wedding on the dot?

29:34.689 --> 29:35.732
My mother.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.359
-Good luck.
-Okay.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.360
Okay.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.737
Come on.

29:43.239 --> 29:44.407
Ah! She's here!

29:45.867 --> 29:48.286
Oh, my God, T! Oh!

29:50.330 --> 29:51.748
Oh, my God.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.250
You look so beautiful.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.835
Thank you.

30:00.256 --> 30:03.927
By the way, Bug, I have to say
that is an amazing tux.

30:04.010 --> 30:10.099
eBay. Worn by the actual stunt double
for Bond, James Bond.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.018
From Russia With Love.

30:12.101 --> 30:13.853
[organ plays "Wedding March"]

30:30.787 --> 30:33.206
That's a nice rack for a dude.

30:37.001 --> 30:39.838
-Did he say what I think he said?
-Uh-huh.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.757
Do you want me to hurt him?

30:44.050 --> 30:46.135
Normally, yes, of course.

30:46.219 --> 30:49.681
But today is T's big day
and I have to be careful

30:49.764 --> 30:52.892
because I can't be responsible
for anything going wrong.

30:53.351 --> 30:54.853
I read people talk to themselves

30:54.936 --> 30:57.647
when they know no one cares
what they have to say.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.233
Do you think that's true?

31:01.568 --> 31:02.819
Maybe just a little.

31:03.486 --> 31:06.656
-[finger cracks]
-[screams, gasps]

31:16.207 --> 31:17.709
He's too late.

31:19.002 --> 31:19.836
Elaine!

31:26.843 --> 31:27.927
[blows nose loudly]

31:32.348 --> 31:33.516
[knocking on door]

31:34.726 --> 31:36.185
[door opens]

31:40.607 --> 31:42.984
-I'm not leaving this room.
-I know.

31:43.651 --> 31:44.485
I know.

31:50.658 --> 31:51.743
It's okay.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.625
I understand what you're going through.

32:01.419 --> 32:06.257
And I'm not judging, or trying to fix it,
or tell you what to do.

32:10.511 --> 32:12.847
I just wanted you to know that I love you.

32:15.183 --> 32:17.352
And that you aren't alone.

32:20.897 --> 32:24.233
Oh, my God.
Lito, you have to get up, right now!

32:24.317 --> 32:25.693
If you don't do it...

32:26.110 --> 32:27.779
No, I'm gonna make you do it,

32:27.862 --> 32:29.948
because it's so freaking perfect.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.491
It's you and Hernando. It...

32:33.284 --> 32:35.119
-It's meant for you.
-What are you talking about?

32:35.203 --> 32:37.705
[stammers] I stayed up all night.
And I read all the scripts.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.082
I was about to give up, but...

32:39.999 --> 32:42.752
I found it. I found the one.

32:45.338 --> 32:49.801
Many of us spend our lives
searching for the one.

32:49.884 --> 32:54.055
For Teagan and Tom,
the search has come to an end.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.350
Marriage is a sacred union.

32:57.433 --> 33:01.062
It is a rite uniting individuals
into a family.

33:01.145 --> 33:03.189
-It bonds two minds.
-I always cry at weddings.

33:03.272 --> 33:06.567
-It bonds two hearts and souls.
-[whispers] Me, too.

33:06.651 --> 33:10.196
You came here today before us as two.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.198
You will leave as one.

33:12.281 --> 33:14.534
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

33:15.118 --> 33:18.788
Teagan Marks, do you take this man
to be your husband,

33:18.871 --> 33:22.083
to love and to cherish, to have and--

33:24.335 --> 33:25.420
[man] Excuse me!

33:25.503 --> 33:28.089
I'm really sorry about this.

33:28.172 --> 33:31.676
I wish I didn't have to do this,
but I don't have a choice.

33:32.468 --> 33:35.263
Special Agent Bendix, FBI.

33:35.346 --> 33:38.725
-I'm going to ask all of you...
-You motherfucker.

33:38.808 --> 33:42.979
...to remain in your seats until we have
secured the individual in question.

33:43.771 --> 33:45.523
-Now hold on a second--
-FBI.

33:45.606 --> 33:48.151
What right do you have
to come into my church?

33:48.234 --> 33:50.903
I am Special Agent Bendix.
I'm here to arrest Nomi Marks.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.572
-Nom?
-I don't understand.

33:52.655 --> 33:55.992
-You said it was fine.
-I thought it was. Oh, God. Oh, God.

33:56.075 --> 33:59.120
What the hell, Bug? You said it worked.

33:59.203 --> 34:01.164
It did work. You saw it worked.

34:01.247 --> 34:04.709
I knew this.
I knew this was going to happen.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.502
Mom, Dad, do something.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.797
It's your own fault.
I told you not to include him.

34:09.881 --> 34:10.798
No. I won't let you.

34:10.882 --> 34:14.135
If you want to finish your sacred rite,
get out of the way.

34:14.218 --> 34:16.137
Otherwise, I can take you downtown, too.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.014
-Teagan, be reasonable.
-But--

34:18.097 --> 34:20.308
We knew this could happen. We warned you.

34:20.391 --> 34:24.103
Michael is a disaster.
He ruins everything!

34:24.187 --> 34:25.980
Janet, calm down!

34:26.564 --> 34:30.151
There are police officers
swarming my daughter's wedding,

34:30.234 --> 34:33.780
as if I have not endured
enough humiliation because of--

34:33.863 --> 34:34.989
Mom!

34:35.073 --> 34:38.493
Go ahead. Take his side.
Even when he destroys your wedding.

34:39.660 --> 34:42.497
Please, don't make it any worse.

34:43.623 --> 34:47.710
Go with these men and we'll see
if anything can be done for you later.

34:48.294 --> 34:51.631
I'm sorry, T. I'm so sorry.

34:53.424 --> 34:56.594
This is what happens when you think
you can outsmart the law.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.139
Turn around. Hands behind your back.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.182
Stop!

35:02.141 --> 35:03.476
Stop!

35:04.560 --> 35:09.315
-Get your damn hands off her!
-Oh, yeah. Go ahead, obstruct.

35:09.398 --> 35:10.983
Get ready to arrest Miss Caplan, too.

35:11.067 --> 35:13.861
-Come on.
-Amanita, it's okay. It's okay.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.572
It's not. This isn't your fault.
It's this moron!

35:16.656 --> 35:20.118
He's had his head so far up his ass,
he didn't bother to check.

35:20.201 --> 35:21.285
[Bendix] Check what?

35:21.369 --> 35:25.706
Good citizens of San Francisco's
upper tax bracket,

35:25.790 --> 35:29.043
this man, Agent Jeffrey Bendix,

35:29.127 --> 35:32.505
has stormed into the middle
of this sacred ceremony,

35:32.588 --> 35:35.424
violating this important moment

35:35.508 --> 35:40.513
for absolutely no other reason
than the gratification of his male ego!

35:40.596 --> 35:41.430
Bullshit.

35:41.514 --> 35:43.724
I urge you
to contact your congressperson--

35:43.808 --> 35:45.434
[woman] I'm a congressperson!

35:45.518 --> 35:48.563
Nomi Marks is one of the most wanted
fugitives in this city.

35:48.646 --> 35:49.564
Prove it!

35:52.692 --> 35:54.986
Show us the warrant, Agent Bendix.

35:55.069 --> 35:58.281
I have the arrest warrant right here.

36:02.493 --> 36:04.245
He doesn't have a warrant.

36:04.328 --> 36:06.247
[Bendix] Of course I have one.

36:06.330 --> 36:07.707
Dad?

36:09.792 --> 36:11.627
-Agent Bendix--
-Nomi Marks is wanted

36:11.711 --> 36:14.547
by at least three different agencies
in the federal system.

36:14.630 --> 36:16.924
I trust that you are familiar

36:17.008 --> 36:20.928
with the law firm
Winslow, Wise, Allegretti &amp; Marks?

36:21.012 --> 36:23.723
I sincerely hope
that you're going to show me the warrant.

36:23.806 --> 36:26.434
What did you do? She did something!

36:26.517 --> 36:29.312
She did some kind of hacking!
This is bullshit!

36:30.062 --> 36:33.107
Take your hands off my daughter...

36:34.692 --> 36:37.069
or I promise you, I will pursue a suit

36:37.153 --> 36:41.908
seeking the kind of damages
that end the careers of men like you.

36:51.792 --> 36:52.960
Whoo!

36:53.669 --> 36:55.129
[applause]

36:57.506 --> 37:00.051
Boo!

37:06.432 --> 37:07.892
Pull yourself together.

37:09.727 --> 37:13.147
Apologies for the, uh,
theatrical misunderstanding.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.399
Minister, if you please.

37:17.026 --> 37:18.444
Thank you.

37:18.527 --> 37:19.820
Are you all right?

37:20.947 --> 37:22.823
He's never called me "daughter."

37:30.998 --> 37:33.167
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

37:36.128 --> 37:37.505
-Yes!
-[laughs]

37:38.965 --> 37:40.049
You good?

37:41.425 --> 37:42.510
We're good.

37:42.593 --> 37:46.973
Teagan Marks, do you take this man
to be your husband?

37:54.730 --> 37:56.065
[sighs]

38:00.319 --> 38:01.529
It's pretty good.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.240
"Pretty good"? Lito, you're crying snot.

38:04.323 --> 38:06.075
Okay, it's brilliant.

38:06.158 --> 38:09.704
It is. It is. It so is.

38:09.787 --> 38:12.999
It's perfect for you. You are Jordi Gallo.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.251
Dani, this is a Hollywood film.

38:15.334 --> 38:17.878
I'm sure right now they are meeting
with Javier Bardem

38:17.962 --> 38:19.672
or Gael García to play Jordi.

38:19.755 --> 38:22.758
Oh, yeah. Javier's amazing.

38:22.842 --> 38:26.679
You see? Even the love of my life
thinks there are better choices.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.890
No. It is meant for you.

38:29.974 --> 38:35.896
I mean, this scene where Jordi
proposes to Pablo at the funeral, it's...

38:35.980 --> 38:37.898
[sobbing]

38:37.982 --> 38:39.817
This is an incredible scene.

38:40.276 --> 38:44.488
I can hear your voice,
I can see you as Jordi Gallo.

38:45.281 --> 38:48.826
All we have to do is get you in the room
with these people,

38:48.909 --> 38:50.369
and they will see it, too.

38:50.453 --> 38:53.539
Dani, please, stop torturing me.

38:53.622 --> 38:57.126
I'm not torturing you. I believe in you.

38:57.209 --> 39:02.006
I don't even have an agent who can call
and get me in this imaginary room.

39:02.089 --> 39:05.384
I didn't have an agent at the beginning
of my career. I didn't let that stop me.

39:07.136 --> 39:07.970
Hernando, please.

39:09.597 --> 39:13.142
Dani, I think Lito
needs a little bit of time.

39:13.476 --> 39:16.520
-Fifty-eight minutes.
-It's not about 58 minutes.

39:17.146 --> 39:19.732
Just give me 58 minutes.
Can you bring a timer?

39:20.608 --> 39:22.943
Fifty-eight minutes. Why 58 minutes?

39:23.027 --> 39:24.737
It's the longest it's ever taken me.

39:24.820 --> 39:26.030
Can I borrow your phone?

39:28.616 --> 39:29.950
What are you gonna do?

39:32.578 --> 39:33.913
Fifty-eight...

39:36.957 --> 39:37.792
Fifty-eight.

39:46.258 --> 39:48.260
[line ringing]

39:49.178 --> 39:52.681
Hi, this is Daniela Velázquez
of the Velázquez Agency in Mexico City.

39:52.765 --> 39:55.518
A little bird told me Kit Wrangler
is casting Iberian Dreams

39:55.601 --> 39:57.853
and I have incredible news for him.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.855
Yes. Mm-hmm. That's right.

39:59.939 --> 40:00.981
-Kit Wrangler?
-I'll hold.

40:01.065 --> 40:04.402
You think you're gonna just call up
and get me a meeting with Kit Wrangler?

40:04.485 --> 40:05.945
Who is Kit Wrangler?

40:06.695 --> 40:08.697
Academy Award-winning producer.

40:08.781 --> 40:11.033
Yes, of course Mr. Wrangler's
in a meeting.

40:11.117 --> 40:14.120
I mean, "Daniela who?
What, Mexico? Where?"

40:14.203 --> 40:18.499
The thing is... to whom am I speaking,
by the way? Jean-Baptiste.

40:18.582 --> 40:22.711
Look, Jean-Baptiste, I need you to indulge
this Mexican madwoman for two minutes.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.797
Just two minutes, because every career,

40:24.880 --> 40:28.092
every successful Hollywood story
can be reduced to a single moment,

40:28.175 --> 40:32.263
to one break where someone recognized
an opportunity that no one else did.

40:32.346 --> 40:33.806
These next two minutes, Jean-Baptiste,

40:33.889 --> 40:36.475
could be the difference
between where you are right now

40:36.559 --> 40:40.729
and the first associate producer credit
of your career.

40:40.813 --> 40:47.153
I want you to go online, click YouTube,
type in "Lito Rodriguez, São Paulo Pride."

40:47.236 --> 40:48.946
I want you to watch the speech,

40:49.029 --> 40:51.699
and then I want you to look
at the number of views.

40:51.782 --> 40:56.412
And if you can see what I see,
you will call me be back.

40:56.495 --> 40:57.997
This is never gonna work.

41:00.291 --> 41:03.085
[line ringing]

41:03.169 --> 41:06.130
-Hi, is Chip in? Yeah, it's Dani.
-Chip? Who's Chip?

41:06.672 --> 41:08.757
-Sleazebag at Variety.
-Chip!

41:08.841 --> 41:13.220
[speaks Italian, laughs]

41:14.305 --> 41:17.099
Oh, really? You saw me in the video?

41:17.183 --> 41:18.851
God, it was insane!

41:18.934 --> 41:21.604
But that was nothing compared
to what happened afterwards.

41:22.313 --> 41:25.941
You naughty thing, you! Do you kiss
your mother with that mouth?

41:26.025 --> 41:28.235
Oh, shit! One sec. One sec.

41:28.736 --> 41:30.446
Jean-Baptiste. [sighs]

41:30.529 --> 41:34.116
I can't believe this. I am talking
to Peter Cohen on the other line.

41:34.200 --> 41:37.161
Yeah, it's for... Ladies of the Canyon.

41:37.661 --> 41:41.582
I know.
I know, it's so not Iberian Dreams.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.877
But Peter's genius is sensing
when an actor's having a moment.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.505
Hold on, hold on.

41:49.715 --> 41:51.550
He's not gonna do it
for less than two million.

41:52.134 --> 41:54.345
Oh, really?
We'll see what you think after Ellen.

41:54.428 --> 41:57.389
That's right. She loves an LGBT story.
Call me back.

41:58.224 --> 42:01.477
Oh, my God, you heard that?
I thought I muted this thing.

42:03.145 --> 42:05.898
Chip, holy shit, that was Lito.
We'll be in LA this week.

42:05.981 --> 42:08.526
Why? Well, no, I'm not really supposed
to say anything.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.361
Oh, but it's so exciting.

42:10.444 --> 42:12.363
No, no, no. It's still a secret.

42:13.072 --> 42:14.698
Promise you won't tell anyone.

42:14.782 --> 42:16.659
[whispers] Lito is meeting with Kit.

42:17.451 --> 42:19.745
I know! It's so good!

42:21.163 --> 42:23.707
Please, please,
promise you won't tell anyone.

42:23.791 --> 42:27.711
Oh, you're a doll. See you in LA. Ciao.

42:30.047 --> 42:32.675
Jean-Baptiste, I'm so sorry.

42:33.300 --> 42:38.013
I know, it's heartbreaking.
He's perfect. Exactly.

42:38.305 --> 42:41.642
Exactly like that, which is-- Oh, shit.
[sighs]

42:41.725 --> 42:44.103
That's Peter again.
I have to call you back.

42:44.979 --> 42:49.567
I know. Lito loves Iberian Dreams,
but the Ladies offer is real.

42:50.234 --> 42:51.402
It's killing me.

42:51.485 --> 42:55.614
It's heartbreaking, but it's timing,
and this business, it's all about timing.

42:57.032 --> 42:58.117
Okay.

42:58.909 --> 43:02.663
All right, yeah. I'll wait...
if you think you can do something.

43:15.050 --> 43:16.427
[phone rings]

43:17.803 --> 43:19.888
Talk to me, Jean-Baptiste.

43:19.972 --> 43:22.891
What? Variety called
while you were with Kit?

43:22.975 --> 43:26.770
That's really weird synchronicity.
But, hey, timing is everything, isn't it?

43:27.396 --> 43:29.398
Yeah. Okay, sure.

43:30.107 --> 43:31.233
Put him on.

43:31.984 --> 43:33.193
Hello, Kit.

43:35.404 --> 43:37.489
I know. I felt it, too.

43:37.573 --> 43:41.076
I believe in this project.
I believe it was destiny.

43:44.705 --> 43:46.123
I can't wait for you to meet him.

43:46.915 --> 43:49.501
I know you are going to love him.

43:50.127 --> 43:50.961
Ciao.

43:54.089 --> 43:56.467
No velvet rope, no closed doors,

43:56.550 --> 44:01.889
no VIP entrance can ever keep
Daniela Velázquez... out.

44:01.972 --> 44:04.308
Dani, that was amazing.

44:04.391 --> 44:07.978
Three first-class tickets.
Offer on the table, contingent to meeting.

44:08.062 --> 44:10.105
[laughing]

44:10.189 --> 44:12.441
-Dani! Thank you.
-You don't have to thank me.

44:12.941 --> 44:17.321
What you have to do is get in that room
and get this part.

44:17.404 --> 44:19.073
-I'm Jordi Gallo.
-You're Jordi Gallo.

44:19.156 --> 44:21.867
-I'm Jordi Gallo.
-You're Jordi Gallo! You're Jordi Gallo!

44:21.950 --> 44:23.410
[laughter]

44:23.494 --> 44:26.121
Pack your bags
because we're going to Hollywood!

44:26.205 --> 44:27.915
-[all scream]
-[timer dings]

44:27.998 --> 44:30.292
[all] Ohhh!

44:31.960 --> 44:34.171
[chanting] Fifty-eight! Fifty-eight!

44:34.755 --> 44:36.131
Fifty-eight!

44:36.215 --> 44:37.257
[phone rings]

44:42.054 --> 44:42.888
Hello?

44:42.971 --> 44:46.850
Mrs. Rasal? There's a man down here
claiming to be a friend of the family.

44:47.559 --> 44:49.228
Kala, hi. This is Ajay.

44:49.311 --> 44:51.438
Ajay. Yes. Hello.

44:51.522 --> 44:53.565
Um, I'm sorry, but Rajan is away.

44:53.649 --> 44:56.402
-He's at a factory in Bangalore.
-How unfortunate.

44:57.069 --> 44:59.780
Look, I was passing
by your fortified sky palace

44:59.863 --> 45:01.907
because I want to drop off a gift,

45:01.990 --> 45:03.909
a better-late-than-never wedding present.

45:04.493 --> 45:06.203
Oh, um...

45:06.286 --> 45:07.621
I know how neighbors can talk,

45:07.704 --> 45:11.583
so I'm happy to have the ever-vigilant
Mr. Security here as chaperone.

45:12.584 --> 45:13.460
Won't take but a moment.

45:14.461 --> 45:16.463
Um... sure. Yeah.

45:30.269 --> 45:31.353
Wow.

45:32.438 --> 45:35.065
A nice fixer-upper
Raj has got himself here.

45:40.821 --> 45:43.031
Um, you really didn't have to do this.

45:43.115 --> 45:44.950
If I can be frank, Mrs. Rasal...

45:46.493 --> 45:48.579
I met Raj quite a bit after your wedding,

45:48.662 --> 45:50.581
and it never occurred to me, not once.

45:50.664 --> 45:52.791
But the moment I saw your reaction
to the fact

45:52.875 --> 45:54.877
that I hadn't been to your wedding,

45:55.377 --> 45:57.087
I realized the scale of my mistake.

45:58.172 --> 46:02.134
This is what they mean I think by...
the "civilizing nature of women."

46:02.843 --> 46:05.554
-Hm...
-I mean, everyone makes mistakes.

46:06.138 --> 46:09.391
But I think it's important to make amends
when appropriate.

46:10.767 --> 46:12.895
As I said, you really didn't have to.

46:14.021 --> 46:16.440
No, but I did.

46:17.441 --> 46:21.778
And my karma has rewarded me
with another opportunity to talk to you.

46:23.363 --> 46:25.115
You believe in karma, Mrs. Rasal?

46:25.199 --> 46:27.534
I do. Um, yes.

46:28.702 --> 46:29.703
Me, too.

46:31.830 --> 46:32.915
Me, too.

46:37.127 --> 46:38.879
Open it up with Raj if you don't mind.

46:38.962 --> 46:41.131
It'll just mean more that way.

46:41.215 --> 46:42.382
Yeah, sure.

46:43.967 --> 46:47.304
And once again,
congratulations to you both.

46:48.430 --> 46:49.431
Thank you.

46:51.183 --> 46:52.184
Bye for now.

47:12.120 --> 47:15.165
Might I have a word with you,
Mr. Secretary?

47:19.670 --> 47:22.673
[Whispers] We are making great progress
with the microspaces.

47:23.423 --> 47:26.093
The neuro-grafting
and lateral demonstrations

47:26.176 --> 47:28.262
are yielding extraordinary results.

47:34.101 --> 47:36.937
I need a meeting with him.

47:37.020 --> 47:38.730
[man] I'm afraid
that's not possible right now.

47:38.814 --> 47:41.191
-[Whispers] When?
-[man] I wish I could say for certain...

47:41.275 --> 47:44.987
Mr. Secretary,
remind him of one thing I am certain of.

47:45.070 --> 47:48.699
This program exists because of me.

47:49.283 --> 47:51.034
[man] I'll make sure he gets the message.

48:16.727 --> 48:17.978
Coroner's report came in.

48:18.687 --> 48:20.397
Toxicology confirms what we saw.

48:21.231 --> 48:23.358
Carol Cumberland took a bunch of pills
and slit her wrists.

48:24.985 --> 48:25.986
Why?

48:27.654 --> 48:29.489
Why was Jonas there?

48:30.741 --> 48:33.076
Are you asking me
or someone else in your head?

48:34.077 --> 48:34.911
You.

48:36.038 --> 48:36.872
Well...

48:38.498 --> 48:41.543
that is what we call police work.

48:41.627 --> 48:44.087
-[phone rings]
-Uh-oh.

48:44.171 --> 48:46.465
This is the wife. Gotta take this.

48:46.548 --> 48:47.966
[Will] Riley.

48:48.050 --> 48:49.885
You have to get back to London.

48:49.968 --> 48:52.262
I know how to get to Whispers,
but we're gonna need more blockers.

48:52.346 --> 48:53.722
How many do you have left?

48:53.805 --> 48:54.723
Uh...

48:55.515 --> 48:56.391
Four.

48:56.475 --> 48:59.478
-Fuck. That's not enough.
-Well, Kala believes she can make them.

49:00.854 --> 49:03.482
-We won't have time to test them.
-Are you talking to Will?

49:06.735 --> 49:08.111
I got some pretty bad news.

49:08.945 --> 49:10.322
-What?
-What?

49:11.406 --> 49:12.658
It's his dad.

49:13.742 --> 49:14.868
He's dying.

50:16.930 --> 50:18.140
Who are you?

50:18.223 --> 50:20.642
It's okay. She's a friend of Will's.

50:34.322 --> 50:36.658
I don't care what my son did.

50:37.743 --> 50:39.453
I just want him to come home.

50:46.460 --> 50:47.919
What happened?

50:48.003 --> 50:50.964
Shock brought on by septicemia.

50:51.548 --> 50:54.259
We think he fell. Hurt himself.

50:54.342 --> 50:56.178
I found him on the floor.

50:56.928 --> 50:58.889
[whispers] On the floor?

50:59.806 --> 51:01.933
-How long?
-[man] Don't know.

51:02.017 --> 51:03.727
But he's a fighter.

51:19.826 --> 51:21.161
Who are you?

51:22.162 --> 51:23.497
-It's me...
-...Dad.

51:24.998 --> 51:26.917
Who the fuck are you? [groans]

51:27.000 --> 51:30.086
I want Will. I want my son.

51:30.629 --> 51:33.882
I'm so sorry. I wish he could be here.

51:34.591 --> 51:35.842
[Will] Dad.

51:35.926 --> 51:40.680
Willie. Where are you? Are you okay?

51:40.764 --> 51:43.433
-I'm okay, Dad.
-You're not okay!

51:43.517 --> 51:47.145
There are government agents saying
all kinds of fucked up shit about you.

51:47.896 --> 51:49.940
-Dad, are you drinking?
-What do you care?

51:50.023 --> 51:52.609
-You're not supposed to be drinking, Dad.
-You're not here!

51:52.692 --> 51:54.402
[sobs] I'm sorry.

51:59.491 --> 52:00.992
I'm sorry, Dad.

52:02.911 --> 52:04.246
I should be here.

52:04.830 --> 52:07.082
I should be here. I'm so sorry.

52:09.459 --> 52:10.627
[father] Willie.

52:13.338 --> 52:14.464
I...

52:17.384 --> 52:18.844
I knew you'd come.

52:21.054 --> 52:22.430
You see me, Dad?

52:26.351 --> 52:27.561
My boy.

52:31.940 --> 52:33.733
-[father] Come on. Fire it in.
-[young Will] Ready?

52:33.817 --> 52:35.151
[father] Come on. You can't hurt me.

52:37.863 --> 52:38.905
Oh!

52:41.908 --> 52:45.662
We used to play catch. Remember?

52:46.496 --> 52:47.873
I remember.

52:50.458 --> 52:52.377
Why did we stop?

52:55.046 --> 52:56.381
I don't know.

53:02.929 --> 53:04.598
Go get your mitt.

53:09.477 --> 53:12.063
-You got a good arm.
-Whoo! Yeah.

53:16.276 --> 53:18.570
-Willie, I gotta go to work.
-Come on, Dad!

53:19.571 --> 53:21.531
No. Come on!

53:21.615 --> 53:22.866
Duty calls.

53:23.575 --> 53:24.451
Dad!

53:25.702 --> 53:26.953
No.

53:27.037 --> 53:28.288
Dad, don't go.

53:28.371 --> 53:29.789
Please!

53:30.415 --> 53:31.625
Dad!

53:33.752 --> 53:34.878
Come back!

53:38.757 --> 53:41.301
Dad. [sobbing]

53:43.303 --> 53:44.596
No.

53:45.305 --> 53:46.723
Come on, Dad!

53:46.806 --> 53:48.183
Please, stay?

53:51.102 --> 53:52.395
Dad?

53:52.479 --> 53:54.773
[Will sobbing]
