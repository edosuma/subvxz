I've always used fashion

as a defense mechanism,

01:20.863 --> 01:24.649
but that and music
and makeup

with Rihanna

03:26.380 --> 03:27.729
on shows and events

03:27.816 --> 03:29.557
for about seven
or eight years.

03:29.644 --> 03:31.776
The most challenging task
we've ever had with her

03:31.863 --> 03:34.344
is to be able to take a show
and reinvent it

03:34.431 --> 03:36.390
in a way that will translate

03:36.477 --> 03:37.782
to millions of people worldwide

03:37.869 --> 03:39.306
in a television product.

03:39.393 --> 03:41.090

the square-on perspective,

03:44.267 --> 03:45.355
you don't see those five,

03:45.442 --> 03:46.965
but as each one steps away,

03:47.052 --> 03:48.184
- it reveals a new form...
- Yeah!

03:48.271 --> 03:49.620
...and it's just the one shot

03:49.707 --> 03:51.013
that takes you slowly
into the environment.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.319
Also, the interesting thing...

03:52.406 --> 03:53.885
Why don't you...
You should be a director.

03:53.972 --> 03:56.497
Like, for real.
You kind of...

03:56.584 --> 03:58.586
So we're six weeks out
at the moment.

03:58.673 --> 04:00.283
I'm a little concerned about
the logistical challenges

04:00.370 --> 04:02.242
of... of turning it around.

04:02.329 --> 04:03.808
Do we have the time
to execute that

04:03.895 --> 04:05.506
and... and t-to make sure

04:05.593 --> 04:06.942
that the range of models
and dancers

04:07.029 --> 04:08.813
and everything else
ticks those boxes

04:08.900 --> 04:11.425
and it feels so inclusive
in terms of this environment

04:11.512 --> 04:13.949
that we're... we're showing
everyone?

04:14.036 --> 04:16.995
Normally, s-six weeks is...
is ambitious on a normal show,

04:17.082 --> 04:20.172
but on a show of this scale,
it's intimidating.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.088
Logistically, timing is not
on our side.

04:23.175 --> 04:23.915
I think
we should think of it

04:24.002 --> 04:25.221
like a fashion musical.

04:25.308 --> 04:25.917
Yep.
Mm-hmm.

04:26.004 --> 04:27.005
You know?

04:27.092 --> 04:28.268
There's... there are
the dancers,

04:28.355 --> 04:29.530
and then there are
the actors.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.053
Technically,
it's a fashion show,

04:31.140 --> 04:33.403
but, you know, again,
Rihanna doesn't do anything

04:33.490 --> 04:34.622
that's already out there,

04:34.709 --> 04:37.059

that concept,

04:37.146 --> 04:39.191
and it's something that,
you know,

04:39.279 --> 04:41.150
if the world's going right,
we're gonna go left.

04:41.237 --> 04:45.894

in general.

04:45.981 --> 04:48.375
Whoo-whoo!

04:48.462 --> 04:50.899

of the design process

04:54.381 --> 04:56.687

my own perspective.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.912
Oh, my God.

05:05.696 --> 05:06.567

You can go
as comfortable as you want.

05:15.445 --> 05:18.013
You can go as sexy
as you want.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.710
And it's just
a whole new outlet

05:19.797 --> 05:21.321
of creating,

05:21.408 --> 05:22.887
making things from scratch.

05:22.974 --> 05:25.107

her hands on first

05:27.849 --> 05:29.590
and touch and try,
