-I made a choice.

00:03.790 --> 00:05.380
I had a chance to save him
but I didn't.

00:05.380 --> 00:08.210
What you did was wrong.
Don't you see that?

00:08.210 --> 00:10.040
She is one from another tribe.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.830
I've come a very long way
to see you.

00:11.830 --> 00:13.080
How did you know about me?

00:13.080 --> 00:15.380
Because I was a captive too.

00:15.380 --> 00:18.040
Continue the treatments
at an increased dosage.

00:18.040 --> 00:19.790
You have enough stem cells?

00:19.790 --> 00:21.670
Well, we've depleted
the initial batch.

00:21.670 --> 00:24.670
But we've managed to secure
a new source.

00:24.670 --> 00:26.670
Got the Coast Guard report
from that night.

00:26.670 --> 00:28.120
Hoping there was
something in there.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.080
So many damn questions.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.790
[Helen]
He moved the necklace.

00:31.790 --> 00:33.420
I'm telling you, he was there.

00:33.420 --> 00:35.170
What do you think
Sarge wanted?

00:35.170 --> 00:36.080
He has something to tell you.

Helen?

01:46.040 --> 01:48.540
Ben. I wasn't expecting you.

01:48.540 --> 01:51.080
Sorry. I know it's early.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.580
I think I left my phone here.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.120
Did you?

01:54.120 --> 01:55.580
I haven't seen it.

01:55.580 --> 01:57.750
-You okay?
-Fine.

[chuckles]

01:59.120 --> 02:00.960
-Weird night.
-Yeah?

02:00.960 --> 02:02.750
Weird? Weird how?

02:02.750 --> 02:03.790
Where to begin?

02:06.710 --> 02:07.540
It's right here.

02:09.210 --> 02:11.380
-Oh.
-Sorry, you were saying?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.500
[Helen]
Nothing.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.040
A weird dream had me thinking.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.000
There's something
on my phone.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.670
I need to...

02:21.670 --> 02:23.000
Sure, do what you need to.

[sighs]

03:02.040 --> 03:04.120
Hey. What are you doing here?

03:04.120 --> 03:05.120
I need to talk to you.

03:08.210 --> 03:11.920
I'm not really ready
to talk about all this.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.080
No, no, no.
It's not about that.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.790
Something's happened.

03:15.790 --> 03:17.710
What? Is Ryn okay?

03:17.710 --> 03:19.080
Ryn's fine.

03:19.080 --> 03:21.170
It's this other one.
The new one.

03:21.170 --> 03:22.080
I think she killed Kyle.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.830
-What?
-Yeah.

03:23.830 --> 03:26.880
-Kyle's dead?
-I think so, yes.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.120
Oh, my God. How does she
even know about him?

03:29.120 --> 03:30.830
She was asking Ryn about Donna,

03:30.830 --> 03:32.620
saying there needed
to be consequences.

03:32.620 --> 03:34.290
And how did she find him?

03:34.290 --> 03:36.000
She used my phone.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.920
She ambushed him
on the docks.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.670
I went down there,
found a bunch of blood,

03:41.670 --> 03:44.000
part of his uniform.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.880
The military are going
to be looking for him.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.250
We need to talk to Ryn.

03:49.250 --> 03:50.880
Yeah.

Good morning.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.210
I'm looking for
the marine archives.

Hello, Ted.

04:30.210 --> 04:32.170
Helen.

04:32.170 --> 04:34.170
Just doing a little
research here.

04:34.170 --> 04:36.210
Saw you come in.

04:38.920 --> 04:40.170
Everything all right?

04:40.170 --> 04:42.330
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:45.380 --> 04:46.750
What's that?

04:46.750 --> 04:48.960
[sighs]

04:48.960 --> 04:50.540
It's the Coast Guard report

04:50.540 --> 04:52.290
from the night of our accident,
out on the water.

04:52.290 --> 04:54.000
Dale got a hold
of it for me.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.080
Really? After all these years?

04:57.080 --> 05:01.170
Well, there's something
about that night that's...

05:03.040 --> 05:05.710
It's never far from my mind.

05:05.710 --> 05:07.830
Yeah, I can imagine.

05:07.830 --> 05:10.210
Yeah, just thought
I'd pin down where we were.

05:10.210 --> 05:14.080
This has the exact
coordinates.

05:16.540 --> 05:19.580
Latitude: 47.75.

05:32.420 --> 05:34.040
-That's funny.
-What?

05:36.210 --> 05:37.920
You need to come with me.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.120
She does what she wants.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.580
She's very angry.

05:48.580 --> 05:50.580
Is that why she came here?
Revenge?

05:50.580 --> 05:53.210
-No.
-What does she want?

05:53.210 --> 05:57.210
Always, our tribes
have been divided.

05:57.210 --> 06:00.920
Everyone stays apart,
far away.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.580
We never go to another's
territory.

06:04.580 --> 06:06.460
Many wars were
fought over this.

06:08.290 --> 06:09.580
I heard of the wars growing up,

06:09.580 --> 06:12.460
but I did not understand

06:12.460 --> 06:14.120
how big the world was.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.120
How many of us.

06:18.710 --> 06:19.750
[Ben]
How many?

06:21.290 --> 06:23.170
Like a forest.

06:23.170 --> 06:24.080
That many trees.

06:25.460 --> 06:26.750
Thousands?

06:26.750 --> 06:28.250
Yes, thousands, I think.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.750
But with the oceans warming,
the food going away,

06:30.750 --> 06:32.330
we must do something.

06:32.330 --> 06:34.960
To help feed each other,
make more babies.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.040
We're trying to help
here on land.
Did you tell her that?

06:37.040 --> 06:39.120
Yes, but she doesn't
trust humans.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.000
She wants help from Ryn.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.670
What kind of help?

06:42.670 --> 06:45.080
To bring the tribes together.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.330
Okay, how?

06:46.330 --> 06:48.880
We will go.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.620
Both of us.

06:50.620 --> 06:51.670
To those far away.

06:53.290 --> 06:55.040
If they see that Ryn and Tia,

06:55.040 --> 06:57.040
from warring tribes,
help each other,

06:57.040 --> 06:59.000
others may follow.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.330
You don't even know
if you can trust her.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.170
This is true.

07:04.170 --> 07:05.880
I do not know.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.250
But if we do nothing,
she is right.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.120
Many more will die.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.210
Maybe all.

07:13.620 --> 07:14.960
You need to be careful, Ryn.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.750
Yes.

07:17.750 --> 07:20.040
She is powerful.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.170
But so am I.

07:23.290 --> 07:25.750
Fill out the paperwork,
hand it in end of day.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.290

graduation...

asses all the way through.

No, thank you.

You don't like the water?

07:53.710 --> 07:56.170
Just want to be as far away
from it as I can.

07:56.170 --> 07:58.210
Didn't you say you worked
on a fishing boat?

07:58.210 --> 08:01.000
You grow up in the circus,
doesn't make you a clown.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.290
I think it's over here.

08:13.080 --> 08:13.920
Yes.

08:15.420 --> 08:17.040
Here.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.040
Look at this.

That's where your
great-great-grandfather

08:22.290 --> 08:26.790
Charles Pownall's ship
went down in 1864.

08:26.790 --> 08:29.290
That's right.

08:29.290 --> 08:32.080
[Helen]
They say he almost
didn't make it.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.290
Lost half his crew.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.420
-Strange coincidence.
-Oh, yeah.

08:39.420 --> 08:41.080
Here, look at this.

08:55.750 --> 08:57.670
This says the massacre
of the mermaids

08:57.670 --> 08:59.290
took place right in the cove.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.460
I thought you didn't believe
in that part of the story.

I believe anymore.

09:24.210 --> 09:26.120
is the story of Charles Pownall

09:26.120 --> 09:28.040
and his tragic mermaid love.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.790
Now, if you guys look over
this way towards the shoreline,

09:32.790 --> 09:34.000
you just might be able to see--

09:34.000 --> 09:37.120
Holy shit! I see one!

09:41.960 --> 09:43.080
I don't see anything.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.750
Well, it's this tail.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.120
It just flipped right up
out of the water.

-[Calvin] I'll take that.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.500

But I saw it. I saw it.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.040
It was right there.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.380
Let's keep it moving,
shall we?

10:08.290 --> 10:10.460
You think she's still here
on land?

10:10.460 --> 10:12.170
Yes. She wants Ryn's help.

10:12.170 --> 10:13.880
She found me at Helen's shop.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.040
She will go back there.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.170
Okay. We'll go with you.

10:16.170 --> 10:19.120
No. No humans.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.380
Okay, well, I was supposed
to head to Seattle today,

10:21.380 --> 10:23.380
to try and speak to that guy

10:23.380 --> 10:25.040
that's doing the ocean
research project.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.330
This is good.

10:28.460 --> 10:31.290
Maybe Ben will go with you?

10:31.290 --> 10:33.380
I need to see my dad.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.790

with my mom's treatment.

10:36.790 --> 10:37.920
Without him...

I'll have my cell.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.960

going on over there.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.120
Hey, these lungs have been
huffing and puffing

10:58.120 --> 10:59.330
long before
it was legal, okay?

10:59.330 --> 11:01.040
A real party animal, huh?

11:01.040 --> 11:03.000
Yeah?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.620
Maybe they should have done
the CPR training first.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.500
I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.670

11:53.380 --> 11:55.000
You killed the soldier.

11:56.210 --> 11:58.170
Yes.

11:58.170 --> 12:01.540
This is bad
for my human friends.

12:01.540 --> 12:03.170
You're very naive.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.540
Humans are not
your friends.

12:08.170 --> 12:09.250
Some can be.

12:11.540 --> 12:13.250
You've been misled.

12:13.250 --> 12:16.540
They destroy the earth.
They kill for sport.

12:18.040 --> 12:21.080
This soldier tortured
your own sister.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.420
He had to die.

12:22.420 --> 12:24.040
[children laughing]

12:25.460 --> 12:27.120
We cannot talk here.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.080
Come with me.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.750
Hey, Roberta.
I'm looking for my dad.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.670
-Is he in?
-Actually, no.

12:39.670 --> 12:42.080
And I'm a little worried.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.580
He had a union
breakfast this morning.

12:43.580 --> 12:45.500
Didn't show.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.170
And he also missed two meetings.

12:47.170 --> 12:49.330
No call, no text.

12:49.330 --> 12:51.960
-Not like him.
-No. No, it's not.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.120
-It's my fault.
-What do you mean?

12:54.120 --> 12:56.670
He can't handle the thought
of my retiring.

12:56.670 --> 12:58.540
Your father hates change.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.750
Yeah. Yeah, that must be it.

13:02.750 --> 13:04.460
Thanks, Roberta.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.830
Xander, what's up?

13:07.830 --> 13:09.790
I just saw Hurricane Katrina,

13:09.790 --> 13:11.710
just walking around,
not a care in the world.

13:11.710 --> 13:15.000
Hey, look, Xan,
we got bigger problems.

13:16.580 --> 13:17.620
Kyle's dead.

13:17.620 --> 13:20.170
Holy shit.

13:20.170 --> 13:22.170
Well, I mean, she probably
offed him.

13:22.170 --> 13:23.580
-That Katrina?
-No, no, no.

13:23.580 --> 13:24.920
It was this other one.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.040
What other one?

13:27.040 --> 13:28.380
This new one.
She just got here.

13:28.380 --> 13:29.710
[sighs]

13:29.710 --> 13:31.040
Really, they just keep coming.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.620
Ryn's handling her.

13:32.620 --> 13:34.790
I gotta go and see my dad.

13:34.790 --> 13:37.000
Kyle was helping
with my mom.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.330
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just go.

13:38.330 --> 13:40.170
Thanks.

13:40.170 --> 13:41.750
[cell phone beeps off]

13:41.750 --> 13:42.750
[engine starts]

13:48.040 --> 13:49.830
[Robb]
But with most innovation,

13:49.830 --> 13:53.330
the unintended consequences are
the ones that haunt us, right?

13:53.330 --> 13:55.960
Now we're living in a plastics
nightmare of our own making

13:55.960 --> 13:57.540
while our oceans and sea life

13:57.540 --> 13:59.210
are being destroyed
before our eyes.

13:59.210 --> 14:01.120
[computer pings]

14:01.120 --> 14:03.500
There are five gyres
around the world,

14:03.500 --> 14:07.420
and within them are massive,
floating islands of plastic,

14:07.420 --> 14:10.500
one of them measuring roughly
twice the size of Texas...

14:10.500 --> 14:11.880
[audience gasps and murmurs]

14:11.880 --> 14:14.000
...polluting the world's oceans,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.670
killing our wildlife
and poisoning the water.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.000
Five of them.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.620
Here's where I could geek out,

14:21.620 --> 14:23.880
give you the minutiae
of how a group of scientists

14:23.880 --> 14:27.380
way, way smarter than me
have built a system

14:27.380 --> 14:29.380
to literally retrieve the trash

14:29.380 --> 14:33.460
using the currents of the oceans
and a giant boom and rim.

14:33.460 --> 14:35.460
Lot of them are
actually here today.

14:35.460 --> 14:37.670
You can speak to them,
pick their brains.

14:37.670 --> 14:41.120
-Ask them too many questions.
-[laughter]

14:41.120 --> 14:43.040
The idea is to get the system
on the water,

14:43.040 --> 14:45.330
starting in the North Pacific
Subtropical Convergence Zone,

14:45.330 --> 14:49.120
halfway between California
and Hawaii, and clean it up.

14:49.120 --> 14:52.420
One giant trash island
at a time.

14:52.420 --> 14:55.080
[door opens and closes]

14:55.080 --> 14:57.290
Dad?

14:57.290 --> 14:59.920
Hey, Mom. Is Dad home?

14:59.920 --> 15:01.960
No, he's at work.

15:01.960 --> 15:05.420
No. Roberta said
she hasn't seen him.

15:05.420 --> 15:07.540
That's funny.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.790
What did you want
to see him about?

15:09.790 --> 15:12.170
-It's nothing important.
-Hey, Ben.

15:12.170 --> 15:14.790
To be honest,
I'm worried about him.

15:14.790 --> 15:17.080
What, did something happen?

15:17.080 --> 15:19.080
He hasn't slept in days.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.920
He's completely withdrawn,
drinking.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.580
Did he tell you about
this Coast Guard report?

15:24.580 --> 15:25.920
He showed it to you?

15:25.920 --> 15:28.330
No. I found it.

15:28.330 --> 15:29.380
On his desk.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.040
Okay, in his desk.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.710
But I wasn't snooping.
I was looking for something.

15:35.710 --> 15:38.580
Ben, I feel responsible.

15:38.580 --> 15:40.000
For what?

15:40.000 --> 15:41.790
His stress.

15:41.790 --> 15:43.960
The strain of everything
that's been going on with me.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.380
The hospitals, the drug trials.

15:45.380 --> 15:48.170
It's just bringing
the whole thing up again.

15:48.170 --> 15:50.790
Mom, I'll find him.

15:50.790 --> 15:52.210
I promise.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.790
[door opens and closes]

16:04.210 --> 16:05.290
[sea lions croaking]

16:17.830 --> 16:19.000
What is this place?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.250
Somewhere safe.

16:22.670 --> 16:24.250
Nowhere near humans is safe.

16:27.210 --> 16:29.120
I'm trying
to help you, Ryn.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.250
I know much more
about them than you do.

16:31.250 --> 16:34.540
They're ignorant, thoughtless,

16:34.540 --> 16:35.880
self-absorbed.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.790
It's the very nature
of being human.

16:41.670 --> 16:43.670
But you said
the humans taught you,

16:43.670 --> 16:44.960
made you strong.

16:46.750 --> 16:47.880
I chose my path.

16:49.920 --> 16:53.080
I observed them,
learned their ways,

16:53.080 --> 16:54.500
then decided my own fate.

16:56.620 --> 16:58.710
Ultimately, I had
to make them pay.

16:58.710 --> 17:00.380
For your capture?

17:00.380 --> 17:01.670
For much more than that.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.000
They stole my song.

17:07.330 --> 17:08.500
How?

17:12.790 --> 17:13.750
They cut me.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.120
In my brain.

17:34.710 --> 17:36.620
Mr. Pownall.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.120
Wasn't expecting to see you
out here today.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.920
Something I can
do for you?

17:39.920 --> 17:42.040
Help me cast off,
will you, Lance?

17:42.040 --> 17:43.120
I'm taking her out.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.420
Not looking too good out there.
Storm rolling in.

17:49.420 --> 17:51.830
Last maritime advisory
had everyone coming in.

17:54.790 --> 17:56.210
[Robb] Now, I know
what you're thinking.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.710
There's this guy in sneakers

17:59.710 --> 18:04.080
who wants me to sink my money
or my time or my energy

18:04.080 --> 18:08.040
into fixing what feels
essentially too big to fix.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.790
And the answer is, yes.

18:09.790 --> 18:14.250
Because we are going
to solve this together.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.460
One way or another.

18:16.460 --> 18:20.000
And if we're not pouring
our money or our time

18:20.000 --> 18:22.830
or our passion into this,

18:22.830 --> 18:24.000
what are we doing?

18:27.170 --> 18:28.420
-Thank you.
-[applause]

18:30.330 --> 18:32.290
Thank you.

18:32.290 --> 18:35.080
Our team is outside
for further questions.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.080
Thank you so much.
I appreciate you coming down.

18:39.080 --> 18:41.040
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Good to see you.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.080
Excuse me,
Mr. Wellens?

18:46.170 --> 18:48.420
-"Robb."
-Robb. I'm Maddie Bishop.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.710
I work at one of the local
Marine Research Centers
outside the city.

18:51.710 --> 18:54.120
-Oh. Which one?
-Bristol Cove.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.000
About 80 miles northwest.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.420
Oh, nice.
What do you do there, Maddie?

18:57.420 --> 18:58.830
Little bit of everything.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.250
It's a nonprofit,

19:00.250 --> 19:03.750
so we do ocean rescue,
research, beg for money.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.120
I hear that.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.540
It was great
to hear you speak.

19:07.540 --> 19:10.540
And, actually, I had a question
about the project.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.080
Yes, you can work on it.

19:12.080 --> 19:15.080
That wasn't my question.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.290
-Oh, okay. I'm sorry.
-[laughs]

19:17.290 --> 19:20.120
Ask away.
Nothing too tough, though.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.290
It's about the wave drift force,

19:22.290 --> 19:24.620
and the design
of the boom and the skirt.

19:24.620 --> 19:26.880
I was just wondering
how many materials did you try

19:26.880 --> 19:29.120
before you found one
that could cancel out

19:29.120 --> 19:31.080
the drag of the anchors?

19:31.080 --> 19:32.380
That's a really good question.

19:36.290 --> 19:39.000
The anchors have been
a problem.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.040
Of course, I haven't shared that
with our investors.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.290
I figured.

19:43.290 --> 19:44.670
[laughs]

19:44.670 --> 19:46.620
You know what?

19:46.620 --> 19:49.040
I haven't eaten a thing
all day.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.710
Do you want to grab a bite,

19:50.710 --> 19:52.380
and I could tell you
about the energy data?

19:52.380 --> 19:55.500
You're not going to hit me up
for money, are you?

19:55.500 --> 19:57.330
Do you have any?

19:57.330 --> 19:59.290
[giggles]

19:59.290 --> 20:00.830
[both laugh]

20:00.830 --> 20:03.000
Okay, well,
I'll pay for dinner then.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.750
-Please.
-Okay, great.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.250
[both hiss]

20:13.250 --> 20:15.830
She's from my colony.

20:15.830 --> 20:19.420
Your colony?
With eyes like mine.

20:19.420 --> 20:22.330
She was separated from yours
when she was a baby.

20:22.330 --> 20:25.120
Our colony found her,
raised her.

20:28.290 --> 20:29.420
[hisses]

20:35.040 --> 20:36.170
Why are you here?

20:36.170 --> 20:38.210
An airplane
landed in the water.

20:38.210 --> 20:40.420
Humans dead inside.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.120
One of ours
saw her come to land.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.290
The others are all right?

20:47.290 --> 20:50.210
They are watching the waters
for more like her.

20:50.210 --> 20:52.250
Why did you leave
your colony?

20:52.250 --> 20:55.920
She was captured,
like my sister.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.040
All tribes are in trouble,
just like us.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.120
I've been a long time
without food.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.040
-I must go hunt.
-We have food.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.750
I'll bring it.

21:04.750 --> 21:06.040
You stay here.

21:10.790 --> 21:12.080
[door closes]

21:12.080 --> 21:15.040
Humans took you.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.960
Your leader,
she is a friend to them.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.420
Defends them.

21:23.420 --> 21:25.960
-Protects them.
-Yes.

21:25.960 --> 21:29.080
The oceans will not be safe
as long as humans live.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.790
They must die.

21:35.790 --> 21:37.710
-All of them.
-[hisses]

21:37.710 --> 21:39.380
[Katrina]
She will never agree.

21:39.380 --> 21:41.250
Then I will do it myself.

21:43.250 --> 21:45.880
You bow to her
with reluctance.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.210
Like you don't want to.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.210
Maybe you would rather
be with me.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.170
With your true colony.

22:08.830 --> 22:12.210
These are the coordinates
from the Coast Guard report.

22:12.210 --> 22:14.290
And here, on the map,

22:14.290 --> 22:16.880
it's right out
at Carson Sound.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.170
Carson Sound.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.460
What is it
about that place?

22:20.460 --> 22:24.000
That's where the shipping lanes
used to be all those years ago.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.210
The deepest part
of the passageway to land.

22:27.210 --> 22:29.920
Our mermaid friends
would've had to use it

22:29.920 --> 22:31.710
to avoid the fishermen.

22:31.710 --> 22:34.170
Unfortunately, it didn't
always work out that way.

22:34.170 --> 22:37.040
Charles Pownall's ship.
Is that where it went down?

22:37.040 --> 22:38.580
That's what the book says.

22:38.580 --> 22:40.210
You think he might
have gone out there?

22:40.210 --> 22:42.120
Oh, I wouldn't be surprised.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.420
What do you think
he's looking for?

22:44.420 --> 22:46.250
Answers.

22:46.250 --> 22:50.080
Something from the night of his
accident with your mother.

22:50.080 --> 22:51.040
He says he saw
something out there.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.960
Maybe he did.

22:55.170 --> 22:57.420
-I need to find him.
-Yeah.

23:06.040 --> 23:09.040
[door opens and closes]

23:23.210 --> 23:24.290
She does not tell you
everything.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.380
Yes, I know.

23:27.380 --> 23:29.920
That's why I left you with her.

23:29.920 --> 23:33.080
She will unite the tribes.
This is true.

23:33.080 --> 23:36.080
But also,
she will kill humans

23:36.080 --> 23:38.040
and anyone who tries
to stop her.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.250
I know you do not
trust the humans either.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.120
But you told me the truth.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.880
You are loyal.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.080
Thank you.

23:52.080 --> 23:54.080
You must kill her.

23:54.080 --> 23:56.540
She is going back now
to gather more--

23:56.540 --> 23:58.330
[sea lions howl and croak]

23:58.330 --> 23:59.960
[water splashes]

24:02.000 --> 24:04.710
[both hiss]

24:04.710 --> 24:06.120
Wait!

24:09.460 --> 24:11.210
This will not
help our tribes.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.210
You know nothing about it.

24:20.170 --> 24:24.120
I will put an end to these
humans once and for all.

24:28.460 --> 24:30.880
And to you,
if you interfere.

24:41.790 --> 24:43.170
I must stop her.

24:43.170 --> 24:44.250
[hisses]

24:59.380 --> 25:01.790
Lance, he take her out?

25:01.790 --> 25:03.420
I tried to stop him.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.040
He wouldn't even
let me set the storm jib.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.580
You know your dad, man.

25:08.210 --> 25:09.290
I'm sorry.

25:19.670 --> 25:20.830
[thunder crashes]

25:33.080 --> 25:35.080
I appreciate you
calling in this favor.

25:35.080 --> 25:37.880
The research boat would've
never made it out in this.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.290
[Xander] What the hell's
your dad thinking?

25:39.290 --> 25:40.420
[Ben]
He's not.

25:40.420 --> 25:42.170
His head's all screwed up.

25:42.170 --> 25:43.420
Don't tell me someone's
been bending his head

25:43.420 --> 25:44.920
with that crazy song.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.460
I don't know what's
going on, okay?

25:46.460 --> 25:48.080
I just know I need
to get out there.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.710
I need to find him.

25:49.710 --> 25:51.290
Well, check the VHF.
Maybe he's on.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.290
[thunder rumbling]

26:21.330 --> 26:24.000
We're a mile away from
the coordinates Helen gave me.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.120
See anything?

26:28.750 --> 26:30.380
No.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.920
Maybe he got thrown off course.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.120
-[radar pinging]
-There. There.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.210
I got him on radar.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.500
No, no, I'm not even
a scientist.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.210
I was majoring in Engineering.

26:47.210 --> 26:49.000
Dropped out.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.290
Your parents
must be so proud.

26:50.290 --> 26:53.120
-Yeah, definitely.
-[laughs]

26:53.120 --> 26:54.580
They calmed down
a little bit when I spoke

26:54.580 --> 26:55.880
at the Ocean Cleanup Initiative.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.290
-You spoke at OCI?
-Mm-hm.

26:57.290 --> 26:59.080
-Wow.
-Right now,

26:59.080 --> 27:01.170
the biggest part of my life
is fundraising.

27:01.170 --> 27:03.460
Turns out, you need investors
to change the world.

27:03.460 --> 27:04.580
This was news to you?

27:06.170 --> 27:07.540
-Yeah, actually.
-[laughs]

27:07.540 --> 27:10.040
Naive or just plain stupid.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.540
I don't know.
Jury's still out.

27:11.540 --> 27:13.460
[laughs]

27:13.460 --> 27:16.000
-Thank you.
-Oh, wonderful. Thank you.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.830
What got you interested
in ocean preservation?

27:18.830 --> 27:20.620
A diving trip.

27:20.620 --> 27:22.420
Saw more garbage
than sea life.

27:22.420 --> 27:24.880
That'll do it.

27:24.880 --> 27:26.210
Tell me what you're thinking,

27:26.210 --> 27:28.290
about the currents
and the skirt.

27:28.290 --> 27:30.880
Aren't you worried the current
is just going to rip

27:30.880 --> 27:32.170
the whole thing apart?

27:32.170 --> 27:34.250
The test runs
are showing that, yeah.

27:34.250 --> 27:36.790
Have you thought about maybe
trying to anchor the system
differently?

27:36.790 --> 27:38.460
Maybe further
under the surface?

27:40.210 --> 27:42.880
Yeah, actually.

27:42.880 --> 27:45.170
A professor from the University
in Geneva suggested it.

27:45.170 --> 27:46.750
We're working on that
right now.

27:46.750 --> 27:48.830
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:48.830 --> 27:50.420
Why do you sound so surprised?

27:50.420 --> 27:51.960
Oh, it was just a theory.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.420
A really good one,
apparently.

27:53.420 --> 27:55.830
[laughs]

27:55.830 --> 27:57.960
Tell me a little bit more
about yourself.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.170
Oh, there's not much to tell.

28:01.170 --> 28:02.540
Come on.

28:02.540 --> 28:05.000
Anyone who could
intellectually dismantle

28:05.000 --> 28:07.830
an innovative scientific model
in 20 minutes flat

28:07.830 --> 28:09.750
is someone with
something to tell.

28:09.750 --> 28:12.620
I... I was a volunteer

28:12.620 --> 28:14.960
and got interested
in the science, that's all.

28:16.170 --> 28:18.000
It's why I wanted
to talk to you.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.540
We've got to solve this.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.080
I mean, if we don't...

28:24.290 --> 28:25.500
what's going to happen?

28:31.170 --> 28:32.670
[wind gusting]

28:35.120 --> 28:37.210
[Helen]
Here, look at this.

28:37.210 --> 28:38.790
[Ted]
"The Myths of Bristol Cove."

28:41.710 --> 28:43.460
Carson Sound.

28:43.460 --> 28:47.000
[Helen] That's where your
great-great-grandfather

28:47.000 --> 28:51.080
Charles Pownall's ship
went down in 1864.

28:57.210 --> 29:01.210
Charles and his crew were out
to sea in a treacherous storm.

29:01.210 --> 29:03.290
[crewman] Captain, we can't
hold her much longer!

29:03.290 --> 29:05.080
She's taking on water!

29:05.080 --> 29:07.420
[Charles] Hold her steady, men!
Away from the break!

29:10.170 --> 29:12.290
[Helen]
This is where he first saw her.

29:17.170 --> 29:21.080
Though Charles
had a human family,

29:21.080 --> 29:22.620
they fell in love.

29:24.040 --> 29:27.580
A baby was born but,
being a hybrid,

29:27.580 --> 29:31.040
it came into the world,
as they often do, deformed.

29:34.710 --> 29:38.040
Charles took the illegitimate
baby to the Haida,

29:38.040 --> 29:39.960
wanting to save it,

29:39.960 --> 29:42.170
but also anxious
to hide it from the world.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.880
Separated from her child,

29:47.880 --> 29:51.750
his mermaid lost her mind
and went back to the water,

29:51.750 --> 29:53.120
never to return.

29:55.040 --> 29:58.710
Infected by her song
and her absence,

29:58.710 --> 30:01.500
Charles lost his senses.

30:07.920 --> 30:09.330
Mainland shores are closed.

30:10.580 --> 30:11.620
What's that out there?

30:15.250 --> 30:17.210
There! I see him,
right ahead of us, right there.

30:17.210 --> 30:18.580
-You see him?
-Yeah, I see him.

30:18.580 --> 30:19.620
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.670
[Helen]
He gathered his crew,

30:26.670 --> 30:29.080
trapped the mermaids in a cove

30:29.080 --> 30:33.250
and slaughtered them
one by one.

30:47.250 --> 30:48.620
The captain! Now, go, go!

30:52.960 --> 30:54.620
-You see him?
-No, you?

30:58.000 --> 30:59.040
There, there.
I see a light down there.

31:14.710 --> 31:16.210
[thunder crashes]

31:32.880 --> 31:34.000
[gasps]

31:34.000 --> 31:36.040
[yells indistinctly]

31:36.040 --> 31:39.380
-Hey!
-Hey, over here! Come on!

31:39.380 --> 31:40.750
[gasping]

31:53.460 --> 31:57.210
The next project is a cleanup
system for river mouths.

31:57.210 --> 31:58.880
That's actually doable.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.290
There's already one
up and working in Baltimore.

32:00.290 --> 32:01.790
Doable?
Where's the fun in doable?

32:03.710 --> 32:05.170
Last call, you guys.

32:05.170 --> 32:07.750
Oh, I'd better get going.

32:07.750 --> 32:08.790
I didn't realize the time.
Thank you.

32:10.040 --> 32:11.080
Thanks.

32:14.460 --> 32:16.170
[both laugh]

32:16.170 --> 32:19.620
I have a really
crazy idea.

32:19.620 --> 32:22.210
Crazier than an ocean
vacuum cleaner?

32:22.210 --> 32:24.040
Probably.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.620
[both chuckle]

32:26.620 --> 32:28.580
Let's do something completely
out of character.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.500
Just something nuts.

32:33.500 --> 32:34.420
Why don't you stay tonight?

32:36.040 --> 32:37.790
-What?
-Stay with me.

32:40.710 --> 32:45.120
Come on, this is going
really well, you and me, right?

32:45.120 --> 32:46.580
I have a great hotel room.

32:46.580 --> 32:50.080
We could just, for once,

32:50.080 --> 32:52.210
not overthink things

32:52.210 --> 32:54.790
and do what we want to.

33:00.540 --> 33:02.290
Wow.

33:02.290 --> 33:04.920
You really cannot
pull that off.

33:08.380 --> 33:09.790
I know.

33:09.790 --> 33:10.790
It's sad.

33:10.790 --> 33:11.880
[laughs]

33:13.120 --> 33:15.000
I thought you were
going to say I complete you.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.170
Oh, I was.
I was going to say that.

33:17.170 --> 33:18.580
But you get total props
for effort.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.000
Great.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.620
Yeah, story of my life.

33:42.040 --> 33:43.120
Dad!

33:43.120 --> 33:44.920
Go, go, go.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.790
Mr. Pownall? Mr. Pownall?

33:48.790 --> 33:50.880
Just stay with me.
Stay with me, okay?

33:58.330 --> 34:01.170
Hey, Ted, look at me.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.000
Ben! Ben, we got to get
out of here!

34:06.080 --> 34:09.080
Hey, Ben! Ben! Hey!

34:09.080 --> 34:12.330
Ben! The storm
is getting worse, okay?

34:12.330 --> 34:14.420
Your dad's pressure,
it ain't good.

34:14.420 --> 34:17.040
He might be hypothermic.
We got to go now, right now!

34:21.040 --> 34:22.460
Dad?

34:24.040 --> 34:25.750

35:19.830 --> 35:21.500

-Yeah, yeah. You got him?

35:21.500 --> 35:22.790
You got him? You got him?

35:22.790 --> 35:24.210
Hey, you all right?

35:24.210 --> 35:25.710
Look at me.

35:25.710 --> 35:27.210
You got to stay warm, okay?

35:27.210 --> 35:29.000
Maybe he just needs some rest.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.710
Whiskey. In the kitchen.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.250
Dad, look at me.

35:34.250 --> 35:35.880
Look at me.

35:35.880 --> 35:38.040
[cell phone vibrates]

35:43.620 --> 35:45.120
-Helen?
-[Helen, on phone] Ryn's here.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.830
She's hurt.

35:46.830 --> 35:48.670
It's really bad.

35:48.670 --> 35:51.040
-[sobbing]
-Get over here. Now!

35:56.210 --> 35:58.960
-What?
-Ryn's at Helen's.

36:00.540 --> 36:02.290
It's bad.

36:04.420 --> 36:06.790
Just go.
I'll take care of your dad.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.040
Okay?

Just go, go, go.

Hey. Where is she?

36:29.210 --> 36:30.920
Eliza is with her.

36:32.670 --> 36:34.000
Why did they
bring her on land?

36:34.000 --> 36:35.540
To protect her.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.960
You go. Be with her.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.710
[Ryn breathing heavily]

36:45.710 --> 36:48.750
Ryn, what happened?

36:48.750 --> 36:52.000
Ben, this new one, Tia.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.460
She cannot be trusted.

36:54.460 --> 36:55.960
It's okay.

36:55.960 --> 36:58.460
We can figure
out how to handle her.

36:58.460 --> 37:00.420
No, she cannot be handled.

37:00.420 --> 37:01.790
She's strong.

37:01.790 --> 37:04.120
Stronger than any
I have ever seen.

37:04.120 --> 37:06.120
-Okay.
-[panting]

37:06.120 --> 37:07.170

all right?

37:39.120 --> 37:40.960
She's in pretty bad shape.

37:49.120 --> 37:50.420
Think he saw
anything down there?

37:57.120 --> 37:58.210
What are you going
to tell him?

38:00.580 --> 38:01.830
No idea.

Night of the accident...

39:18.120 --> 39:19.250
all those years ago.

39:21.040 --> 39:22.620
What I thought I saw.

39:26.170 --> 39:27.710
It was real.

39:32.830 --> 39:34.880
It's real, Dad.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.080
They're real.

When you were down there,

did you see
my friend, Sarge?

40:07.880 --> 40:10.080
Sarge is... dead.

40:11.920 --> 40:13.120
Yes, I know.

But I saw him.

I was asleep.

He came to me.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.960
Called me to the water.

And then there he was,

40:27.620 --> 40:28.540
right in front of me.

40:31.120 --> 40:33.210
He came from the spirit world.

40:33.210 --> 40:34.290
[sighs]

40:36.540 --> 40:38.120
He was trying
to tell me something.

What?

40:49.500 --> 40:51.120
What does it mean?
