00:08.016 --> 00:10.555
Good morning, sir. Doctor.

00:13.689 --> 00:16.607
- Something wrong?
- Yes.

00:16.776 --> 00:20.608
There's something odd about that man
and I can't quite pinpoint it.

00:20.780 --> 00:22.773
Perhaps you're making
a rather hasty judgement.

00:22.949 --> 00:25.440
Mr. Norman has only
been aboard 72 hours.

00:25.618 --> 00:28.738
Well, I know when something doesn't
strike me right, and he doesn't.

00:28.913 --> 00:32.863
Specifics, doctor.
Labels do not make arguments.

00:33.042 --> 00:34.157
All right.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.661
There's something wrong
about a man who never smiles,

00:36.838 --> 00:39.625
whose conversation never varies
from the routine of the job,

00:39.799 --> 00:42.670
and who won't talk
about his background.

00:42.844 --> 00:44.588
I see.

00:44.763 --> 00:46.257
Spock.

00:47.390 --> 00:51.851
I mean that it's odd
for a non-Vulcan.

00:52.896 --> 00:54.390
The ears make all the difference.

00:54.564 --> 00:59.061
I find your argument strewn
with gaping defects in logic.

00:59.236 --> 01:02.272
Maybe, but you can't evaluate a man
by logic alone.

01:02.447 --> 01:04.654
Besides, he has avoided
two appointments

01:04.825 --> 01:07.197
that I've made for his physical exam,
without reason.

01:07.369 --> 01:09.278
That's not at all surprising, doctor.

01:09.455 --> 01:13.322
He's probably terrified
of your beads and rattles.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:22.092 --> 01:24.050
Command personnel only...

01:40.570 --> 01:41.898
Yes, Mr. Sulu.

01:42.071 --> 01:46.199
There's an unplanned course change
being fed into the instruments, sir.

01:46.534 --> 01:47.945
Correct it.

01:49.787 --> 01:51.329
I can't, sir.

01:52.999 --> 01:55.869
Auxiliary Control, this is the captain.

01:56.502 --> 01:58.875
Auxiliary Control,
what's going on down there?

01:59.047 --> 02:02.083
Sir, Auxiliary Control
is on total override.

02:02.258 --> 02:03.883
Kirk to Security.

02:04.052 --> 02:06.044
Security. Lieutenant Rowe here, sir.

02:06.221 --> 02:08.711
Intruder alert. Deck 8.
Auxiliary Control.

02:08.889 --> 02:10.217
Acknowledged.

02:10.392 --> 02:13.013
Lieutenant Uhura,
have Mr. Spock report to the Bridge.

02:13.186 --> 02:14.217
Aye, sir.

02:14.396 --> 02:16.969
What's the imposed course,
Mr. Sulu?

02:17.148 --> 02:21.193
Turning on 307 degrees, mark 8.

02:21.653 --> 02:23.895
Being executed now, sir.

02:32.706 --> 02:34.331
Take care of him.

02:39.755 --> 02:41.913
- Security to Captain Kirk.
- Kirk here.

02:42.091 --> 02:44.463
Lieutenant Rowe, sir.
I'm in Auxiliary Control.

02:44.635 --> 02:46.509
Ensign Jordan's been knocked out.

02:46.762 --> 02:48.885
The directional master controls
have been jammed.

02:49.056 --> 02:50.336
They're totally unworkable.

02:50.516 --> 02:52.508
- Any sign of the intruder?
- No, sir. He's gone.

02:52.685 --> 02:54.677
I've put out a full security alert
on all decks.

02:54.853 --> 02:56.846
Find him. Kirk out.

02:58.482 --> 03:01.602
Mr. Spock, we seem to be taking
an unscheduled ride.

03:01.777 --> 03:03.236
Interesting.

03:03.404 --> 03:04.815
Mr. Sulu.

03:04.989 --> 03:08.737
Cut into Emergency Manual Monitor.
I want the override broken.

03:09.285 --> 03:12.202
Sir, the instruments won't respond.

03:14.373 --> 03:16.449
Emergency Manual Monitor, report.

03:17.001 --> 03:19.124
This is Captain Kirk. Acknowledge.

03:20.922 --> 03:24.088
Emergency Manual Monitor.
This is the captain, report.

03:24.384 --> 03:26.460
Here, you're not allowed...

03:26.636 --> 03:30.254
Acknowledge. This is the captain.
Scotty, acknowledge.

03:30.807 --> 03:33.724
Scotty, what's going on down there?
Kirk to Engineering.

03:34.477 --> 03:36.304
This is the captain. Scotty, report!

03:36.479 --> 03:38.306
Scotty, the intruder is in your area.

03:45.488 --> 03:47.481
What's going on down there?
Scotty!

03:52.329 --> 03:54.487
- Captain. He's here.
- Scotty.

03:55.373 --> 03:56.832
Scotty.

03:58.543 --> 03:59.741
Scotty?

04:00.253 --> 04:01.416
Security.

04:01.588 --> 04:04.791
The intruder's in Engineering.
Have all units converge on that point.

04:04.967 --> 04:08.086
Sir, we're picking up speed.
Warp 5, 6. Warp 7, sir.

04:08.262 --> 04:09.839
Cut power.

04:10.514 --> 04:12.590
I can't, sir.
All the controls are jammed.

04:12.766 --> 04:14.391
Spock, take over.

04:16.687 --> 04:18.976
It will not be necessary, captain.

04:26.530 --> 04:29.104
Tell Security we found the intruder.

04:30.201 --> 04:32.526
You mind telling me
what this is all about, mister?

04:32.703 --> 04:35.111
I am in total control of your ship.

04:35.289 --> 04:40.414
I have connected the matter-antimatter
pods to the main navigational bank.

04:40.586 --> 04:42.958
A trigger relay is now in operation.

04:43.214 --> 04:44.957
Any attempts to alter course

04:45.132 --> 04:48.383
will result in the immediate
destruction of this vessel.

04:48.553 --> 04:49.632
Spock?

04:50.805 --> 04:54.719
Confirmed, captain.
He's taken out all the override controls.

04:54.892 --> 04:58.890
If we tamper without knowing
where the trigger relay is...

04:59.897 --> 05:02.056
...we could extinguish ourselves.

05:04.569 --> 05:06.229
Who are you?

05:06.404 --> 05:09.607
I assure you, we are
no threat to humanity...

05:10.366 --> 05:12.276
...or humanoid life.

05:13.078 --> 05:15.070
We mean you no harm.

05:15.830 --> 05:17.870
But we require your ship.

05:18.083 --> 05:21.416
You require..?
Who and what are "we"?

05:42.858 --> 05:45.693
Space, the final frontier.

05:51.658 --> 05:55.988
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

05:56.163 --> 06:00.031
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

06:00.292 --> 06:03.496
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

06:04.338 --> 06:07.256
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

06:54.514 --> 06:57.266
- An android.
- And most sophisticated.

06:57.726 --> 06:59.802
I control the trigger relay, sir.

07:00.479 --> 07:03.515
I cannot be overcome
by physical means.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.350
And if you attempt
to use your phasers,

07:05.525 --> 07:07.814
the trigger relay will be activated.

07:07.986 --> 07:11.236
We shall continue on
our present course for approximately

07:11.406 --> 07:14.692
four solar days,
at which time we shall arrive

07:14.868 --> 07:17.324
at our destination.

07:17.496 --> 07:19.156
Who sent you?

07:21.208 --> 07:25.040
I am not programmed
to respond in that area.

07:33.596 --> 07:36.169
He simply appears to have
turned himself off, captain.

07:38.350 --> 07:40.557
And since we cannot repair
the damage he has done

07:40.728 --> 07:42.305
without destroying the ship...

07:42.480 --> 07:45.646
It seems we're going to
take a little trip.

07:50.279 --> 07:53.529
Captain's log, stardate 4513.3.

07:54.534 --> 07:57.404
After having been
taken over by an android,

07:57.578 --> 08:01.528
the Enterprise has been under way
at warp 7 for four days.

08:01.708 --> 08:03.332
Now, we are entering orbit

08:03.501 --> 08:06.455
around a planet which has
never been charted.

08:14.971 --> 08:16.631
Captain Kirk.

08:19.225 --> 08:24.053
The following individuals will be
transported down to our planet:

08:24.439 --> 08:26.895
Yourself, science officer,

08:27.067 --> 08:28.775
medical officer,

08:28.944 --> 08:30.521
communications officer,

08:30.695 --> 08:32.154
and navigator.

08:32.322 --> 08:35.442
Any meetings or discussions
can be held aboard the Enterprise.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.951
If you do not come with me,
your engines will be destroyed

08:39.121 --> 08:42.905
and you will remain
in orbit here forever.

08:44.126 --> 08:46.118
I must say,
that's a gracious invitation.

08:46.461 --> 08:48.371
There is a word.

08:48.547 --> 08:52.331
Among us, there is no
corresponding meaning.

08:52.509 --> 08:56.839
But it seems to mean something
to you humans.

08:57.306 --> 08:59.049
And what is that word?

08:59.850 --> 09:00.881
Please.

09:21.122 --> 09:24.906
Our planet's surface is
what you classify as K-type.

09:25.084 --> 09:27.622
Adaptable for humans
by use of pressure domes

09:27.795 --> 09:29.704
and life-support systems.

09:33.593 --> 09:37.009
- I have brought them.
- He is waiting.

09:39.223 --> 09:41.465
If you will follow us, please.

09:51.361 --> 09:53.686
I don't believe it.

09:53.947 --> 09:56.236
Welcome aboard, Kirk.

09:56.408 --> 09:58.696
Been a long time, eh?

09:58.868 --> 10:00.327
Harry Mudd!

10:01.037 --> 10:03.659
Well, to be absolutely accurate,
laddie buck,

10:03.832 --> 10:06.239
you should refer to me
as Mudd the First,

10:06.418 --> 10:10.001
ruler of this entire sovereign planet.

10:10.756 --> 10:11.870
Ruler?

10:12.049 --> 10:14.088
I want control of my ship
returned immediately.

10:14.259 --> 10:15.884
We have no intention of staying.

10:16.053 --> 10:18.211
Well, I'm afraid there's
a bit of a problem there.

10:18.388 --> 10:21.473
- Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise.
- Alice.

10:25.938 --> 10:30.398
Now, now, Jamie boy, let's have no
unauthorised communications.

10:30.567 --> 10:32.394
You know this man, captain?

10:33.821 --> 10:36.905
Do I know him?
Harcourt Fenton Mudd.

10:37.074 --> 10:38.402
- Thief.
- Come now.

10:38.576 --> 10:40.319
- Swindler and con man.
- Entrepreneur.

10:40.494 --> 10:43.068
- Liar and rogue.
- Did I leave you with that impression?

10:43.247 --> 10:45.121
Belongs in jail,
which is where I left you.

10:45.291 --> 10:47.579
And thereby hangs a tale, yes.

10:47.752 --> 10:50.077
But look around you, Kirk.

10:50.254 --> 10:52.128
Quite a place here, isn't it?

10:52.298 --> 10:55.085
- I hope you're all going to enjoy it.
- Mudd.

10:55.259 --> 10:57.715
I want that trained machine
of yours, Norman,

10:57.887 --> 11:00.295
to deactivate the trigger mechanism

11:00.473 --> 11:01.718
and free my ship.

11:01.891 --> 11:04.299
- I shall do that when I'm ready.
- I'm telling you now.

11:04.477 --> 11:07.763
And I do the telling on this planet,
Kirk, old boy.

11:07.939 --> 11:09.433
You do the listening.

11:11.609 --> 11:12.938
All right, I'll listen.

11:14.195 --> 11:15.773
What are you telling?

11:15.947 --> 11:18.983
Merely that you might as well
start enjoying yourselves.

11:19.159 --> 11:20.819
It's really a very, very nice place.

11:20.994 --> 11:23.117
And you're all going to be here,

11:23.288 --> 11:25.161
quite probably,

11:25.331 --> 11:27.657
for the rest of your lives.

11:43.183 --> 11:47.395
Harry Mudd, you're a liar,
and an outlaw, and in deep trouble.

11:47.562 --> 11:50.267
I want navigational control restored,
and my ship released.

11:50.899 --> 11:53.770
Sorry, that'd be against the law.

11:53.944 --> 11:55.319
My law.

11:55.487 --> 11:57.978
Decreed by Mudd the First.

11:58.157 --> 12:02.071
Voted in by the resident population.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.279
Lovely, aren't they?

12:05.914 --> 12:08.999
You must admit, Kirk,
that I still retain my eye for beauty.

12:09.627 --> 12:12.165
I decreed that I should
always be surrounded by it,

12:12.338 --> 12:15.457
and my decrees always
come to pass.

12:23.683 --> 12:27.348
I've had 500 of them
made up to attend me.

12:34.986 --> 12:38.853
All of them identical, beautiful,

12:39.031 --> 12:41.867
compliant, obedient.

12:42.035 --> 12:45.368
Five hundred of the same model?
That seems rather redundant.

12:45.538 --> 12:49.037
I have a fondness for this
particular model, Mr. Spock,

12:49.209 --> 12:54.120
which you, unfortunately,
are ill-equipped to appreciate.

12:59.177 --> 13:00.719
All right, Harry.

13:00.887 --> 13:02.298
Explain. How did you get here?

13:02.472 --> 13:06.173
We left you in custody after
that affair on the Rigel mining planet.

13:06.351 --> 13:10.265
Yes, well, I organised
a technical information service,

13:10.438 --> 13:13.689
bringing modern industrial techniques
to backward planets,

13:13.859 --> 13:16.314
making available
certain valuable patents

13:16.486 --> 13:18.894
to struggling young civilisations
throughout the galaxy.

13:19.072 --> 13:21.314
Did you pay royalties to
the owners of those patents?

13:23.994 --> 13:25.987
Well, actually, Kirk,

13:26.163 --> 13:29.995
as a defender of the free-enterprise
system, I found myself

13:30.167 --> 13:34.247
in a rather ambiguous conflict,
as a matter of principle.

13:34.421 --> 13:36.081
He did not pay royalties.

13:36.256 --> 13:38.830
Knowledge, sir, should be free to all.

13:39.009 --> 13:42.259
- Who caught you?
- That is an outrageous assumption!

13:42.429 --> 13:44.469
Yes. Who caught you?

13:45.766 --> 13:48.222
I sold the Denebians

13:48.394 --> 13:50.967
all the rights to
a Vulcan fuel synthesizer.

13:51.147 --> 13:53.056
And the Denebians
contacted the Vulcans.

13:53.232 --> 13:55.853
- How'd you know?
- That's what I would have done.

13:56.027 --> 13:57.735
It's typical police mentality.

13:57.903 --> 14:00.276
They've got no sense of humour.
They arrested me!

14:00.448 --> 14:02.025
I find that shocking.

14:02.199 --> 14:06.114
Worse than that. Do you know what
the penalty for fraud is on Deneb V?

14:06.287 --> 14:10.119
The guilty party has his choice:
Death by electrocution, death by gas,

14:10.291 --> 14:13.043
death by phaser, death by hanging...

14:13.211 --> 14:18.916
The key word in your entire peroration,
Mr. Spock, was..."death."

14:19.092 --> 14:20.372
Barbarians.

14:20.551 --> 14:23.552
- Well, of course I left.
- He broke jail.

14:24.138 --> 14:26.712
- I borrowed transportation.
- He stole a spaceship.

14:26.891 --> 14:28.967
The patrol reacted
in a hostile manner.

14:29.144 --> 14:30.258
They fired at him.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.476
They've got no respect
for private property.

14:32.647 --> 14:34.806
They damaged
the bloody spaceship!

14:37.652 --> 14:40.226
Well, I got away,
but I couldn't navigate.

14:40.405 --> 14:44.154
So I wandered out
through unmapped space...

14:44.951 --> 14:46.778
...and here I found...

14:48.455 --> 14:49.914
...Mudd.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.995
You went to substantial risk
and effort to bring a starship here.

14:53.502 --> 14:56.538
Logically, you must have
a compelling motive.

14:57.214 --> 15:00.998
Spock, you're going to love it here.
They all talk just the way you do.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.011
Go on, get on with it, Harry.

15:04.179 --> 15:06.006
Yes, well, right, laddie buck.

15:06.181 --> 15:08.055
Well, so here I am, in a planet

15:08.225 --> 15:11.594
with over 200,000 hard-working,
happy androids,

15:11.770 --> 15:16.100
all of whom exist merely
to serve my every... whim.

15:17.526 --> 15:21.275
It's absolute paradise.

15:21.864 --> 15:24.153
Then, I am unable
to discern your problem.

15:24.325 --> 15:26.780
They won't let me go!

15:26.952 --> 15:28.447
They want to study me.

15:28.621 --> 15:31.871
They want to learn more
about human beings.

15:32.041 --> 15:34.793
- They picked a fine representative.
- Watch your tongue, lad.

15:34.961 --> 15:37.119
You're talking about Mudd the First.

15:37.880 --> 15:41.878
Well, anyway, I ran out of ideas.

15:42.051 --> 15:45.218
I simply ran out of things
for them to do.

15:46.097 --> 15:49.347
And they insisted that I bring them
more human beings.

15:49.517 --> 15:53.562
They need human beings
to serve, to study.

15:53.730 --> 15:57.395
So I had to promise them
a prime sample.

15:57.567 --> 15:59.892
A starship captain.

16:00.820 --> 16:04.865
Bright, loyal, fearless
and imaginative.

16:05.033 --> 16:07.987
Any captain would have done,
I was just lucky enough to get you.

16:08.161 --> 16:10.154
So you are going to
take over for me here

16:10.330 --> 16:12.572
and I get off this rock,
and back to civilisation.

16:12.749 --> 16:13.912
I think not, Harry.

16:14.084 --> 16:17.916
You misunderstand me, lad.
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

16:18.088 --> 16:19.879
You've no choice.

16:20.382 --> 16:23.383
- Show them to their quarters.
- Yes, my Lord Mudd.

16:23.552 --> 16:25.295
This way, please.

16:27.723 --> 16:29.265
Harry, what's this?

16:33.186 --> 16:35.678
That, gentlemen, is a shrine

16:35.856 --> 16:38.014
to the memory of my beloved Stella.

16:38.192 --> 16:41.228
- Who?
- Stella, my wife.

16:41.403 --> 16:44.986
- Dead?
- Oh, no, no, no, merely deserted.

16:45.157 --> 16:48.775
You see, behind every great man,
there is a woman, urging him on.

16:48.953 --> 16:50.613
And so it was with my Stella.

16:50.788 --> 16:52.946
She urged me on into outer space.

16:53.123 --> 16:54.950
Not that she meant to,

16:55.125 --> 16:57.581
but with her continual,

16:57.753 --> 17:01.751
eternal, confounded nagging...

17:02.341 --> 17:04.878
Well, I think of her constantly,

17:05.051 --> 17:08.717
and every time I do,
I go further out into space.

17:09.598 --> 17:11.141
That's very interesting.

17:11.309 --> 17:13.882
You leave your wife,
and then bring her along.

17:14.060 --> 17:16.635
I had the androids construct
a perfect replica of Stella

17:16.814 --> 17:20.479
so that I could gaze upon her
and rejoice in her absence.

17:24.030 --> 17:26.271
Gentlemen, attend.

17:27.492 --> 17:28.986
Stella, dear.

17:29.661 --> 17:34.038
Harcourt! Harcourt Fenton Mudd.
What have you been up to?

17:34.207 --> 17:35.487
Nothing good, I'm sure.

17:35.667 --> 17:38.668
Well, let me tell you,
you lazy, good-for-nothing...

17:38.837 --> 17:40.710
Shut up!

17:44.342 --> 17:46.002
Marvellous, isn't it?

17:46.177 --> 17:49.381
I finally have the last word with her,

17:49.556 --> 17:51.845
and with you.

17:58.523 --> 18:00.599
You will find this quite comfortable.

18:00.776 --> 18:02.353
Your quarters are down the hall.

18:02.527 --> 18:05.481
- If there is anything you need...
- Yes, my ship.

18:05.656 --> 18:08.443
We are not programmed
to respond in that area.

18:08.617 --> 18:11.190
Norman, who created you?

18:11.370 --> 18:12.994
The Makers designed us.

18:13.163 --> 18:15.370
They came from
the galaxy of Andromeda.

18:15.666 --> 18:17.705
Then your Makers
weren't humanoids.

18:17.876 --> 18:20.830
They were, as you say,
quite humanoid,

18:21.005 --> 18:24.208
but, unlike your civilisation,
robots were common.

18:24.383 --> 18:28.463
We performed the necessary service
functions and freed our makers

18:28.637 --> 18:32.421
- to evolve a perfect social order.
- What became of them?

18:32.600 --> 18:35.554
Our home planet's sun
became a nova.

18:35.728 --> 18:38.682
Only a few exploratory
outposts survived.

18:38.856 --> 18:42.391
This unit, myself...

18:43.569 --> 18:46.523
...was part of one such outpost
in your galaxy.

18:46.697 --> 18:50.742
- Then, some of your Makers survived.
- No, captain.

18:50.910 --> 18:53.483
They died, over the stretch of time.

18:53.663 --> 18:55.205
Whom do you serve now?

18:55.415 --> 18:57.988
We serve Harry Mudd.

18:58.167 --> 19:00.409
He has given us purpose again.

19:00.587 --> 19:02.663
It is necessary to have purpose.

19:02.839 --> 19:05.164
We lacked it for a long time.

19:08.595 --> 19:12.545
We have a very extensive
library section for your amusement.

19:12.724 --> 19:14.717
Our research laboratories
and workshops

19:14.893 --> 19:16.435
are extremely well-equipped.

19:16.603 --> 19:18.845
- You are free to use them.
- You are free to visit them.

19:19.022 --> 19:20.765
All right, we might later.

19:20.941 --> 19:22.933
In the meantime,
would you mind leaving us?

19:23.109 --> 19:25.435
- Why should we leave you?
- Why should we leave you?

19:25.612 --> 19:28.068
Because we don't like you.

19:28.240 --> 19:29.485
Now...

19:33.078 --> 19:34.821
Well. Opinions?

19:34.997 --> 19:36.906
I think we're in a lot of trouble.

19:37.082 --> 19:39.454
That's a great help, Mr. Chekov.
Bones?

19:39.626 --> 19:42.711
Well, I think Mr. Chekov's right.
We are in a lot of trouble.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.038
Spock? And if you say
we're in a lot of trouble...

19:45.215 --> 19:46.710
We are.

19:48.010 --> 19:50.762
And we must direct our attack
to the heart of the matter.

19:50.929 --> 19:54.215
Obviously, this many androids
cannot operate independently.

19:54.391 --> 19:56.349
There must be
a central control system

19:56.518 --> 19:58.891
which guides the entire
android population.

19:59.063 --> 20:01.980
Try and find it. The rest, look around.
Learn everything you can.

20:02.149 --> 20:05.150
I'll see what else I can find out
from Mr. Mudd. Let's go.

20:08.280 --> 20:11.566
I trust you are enjoying yourself,
Mr. Spock.

20:11.742 --> 20:13.486
Very interesting.

20:14.954 --> 20:17.077
Very interesting.

20:21.836 --> 20:23.829
This is a most unusual device.

20:24.005 --> 20:26.875
It is our central control complex.

20:29.218 --> 20:32.552
Did I understand there are more
than 200,000 of you?

20:32.722 --> 20:37.099
207,809.

20:37.268 --> 20:40.684
This would seem to be
a simple relay centre.

20:40.855 --> 20:43.181
Are all of you controlled
through this device?

20:49.739 --> 20:52.859
I am not programmed
to respond in this area.

20:53.827 --> 20:56.662
That's quite understandable.

20:56.830 --> 20:58.953
These are our Barbara series.

20:59.124 --> 21:01.615
The body is covered with
a self-renewing plastic

21:01.793 --> 21:04.711
over a skeleton
of beryllium-titanium alloy.

21:05.505 --> 21:08.210
- Very impressive.
- I should say so.

21:08.550 --> 21:10.377
Well, I must say, I like the styling.

21:10.969 --> 21:15.049
They were, of course,
made to my personal specifications.

21:15.224 --> 21:18.557
As indeed were the Maisie series,
the Trudy series,

21:18.727 --> 21:21.397
and particularly
the Annabelle series.

21:21.563 --> 21:23.852
Don't you believe
in male androids, Harry?

21:24.400 --> 21:29.026
Male? I suppose
they have their uses.

21:29.196 --> 21:32.067
How long does a body like that last?

21:32.533 --> 21:35.285
None of our android bodies
has ever worn out.

21:35.453 --> 21:37.908
However, the estimated duration
of this model

21:38.080 --> 21:39.740
is 500,000 years.

21:39.915 --> 21:43.249
Five hundred thousand years?

21:43.419 --> 21:46.420
Our medi-robots are able
to place a human brain

21:46.589 --> 21:49.424
within a structurally compatible
android body.

21:49.592 --> 21:54.301
Immortality and eternal beauty.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.774
Captain, I've just had a most
fascinating meeting with Norman.

22:05.942 --> 22:08.777
I'm convinced that I've discovered
a very important inconsistency.

22:08.945 --> 22:11.614
Well, I'm so glad
you enjoyed it, doctor.

22:11.781 --> 22:13.655
Jim, you should see
the research facilities.

22:13.825 --> 22:15.568
They've got a lab down there that...

22:15.744 --> 22:17.736
Well, I could spend
the rest of my life studying it.

22:17.912 --> 22:20.830
I do so admire a man who
devotes himself to knowledge.

22:20.999 --> 22:23.620
Don't lose your head, Bones,
nobody's staying anywhere.

22:23.793 --> 22:25.786
Stubborn, Kirk, stubborn.

22:25.962 --> 22:27.789
Well, I wouldn't be bored,
I can tell you that.

22:27.964 --> 22:29.957
Let go of me!
What kind of a woman..?

22:30.133 --> 22:32.126
This is the last one, lord.

22:33.011 --> 22:35.846
Splendid, splendid!
Welcome to Mudd, Mr. Scott.

22:36.014 --> 22:39.051
Harry Mudd!
Oh, you bogus rat, you.

22:39.226 --> 22:40.720
You're the cause of all this,
are you?

22:41.144 --> 22:42.473
You were ordered to stay aboard.

22:42.646 --> 22:44.188
Aye, sir, and I stayed,

22:44.356 --> 22:47.143
until that female gargantua threw me
into the transporter beams.

22:47.693 --> 22:49.104
What does she mean,
"the last one"?

22:50.404 --> 22:52.396
Didn't I tell you, Kirk?

22:52.573 --> 22:55.324
I beamed a few dozen androids
up to your ship.

22:55.492 --> 22:58.446
They've been sending your crew to
the surface for the past couple hours.

22:59.079 --> 23:00.823
They're all down now.

23:00.998 --> 23:02.825
Are you out of your mind?

23:03.876 --> 23:05.869
You can't beam down
an entire crew of a spaceship.

23:06.045 --> 23:07.373
Somebody has to be onboard.

23:07.546 --> 23:11.330
There is an entire crew aboard.
An entire crew of androids.

23:11.509 --> 23:13.715
They learn very quickly, captain.

23:13.886 --> 23:16.840
The fact is, I've taken over
your whole ship.

23:17.014 --> 23:19.137
There's nothing you can do about it.

23:28.359 --> 23:29.640
Harry.

23:31.154 --> 23:33.858
Harry, you'll never get away with it.

23:36.034 --> 23:38.525
- Well, who's to stop me?
- Starfleet.

23:39.162 --> 23:42.780
But now I have a ship of my own,
and it's as fast as any in the fleet.

23:42.957 --> 23:45.246
How will they catch me?

23:45.418 --> 23:46.877
Just think of it, laddie buck.

23:47.045 --> 23:50.959
Harry Mudd, with his own crew
of lovelies, aboard your vessel.

23:51.132 --> 23:53.920
- Think about that.
- I'm trying not to.

23:55.220 --> 23:56.679
Alice.

23:59.808 --> 24:02.180
He could successfully
accomplish it, captain.

24:02.352 --> 24:06.184
I've questioned some of the androids,
and they are totally loyal to Mudd.

24:06.732 --> 24:09.768
Perhaps of more concern is the fact
that this android population

24:09.943 --> 24:14.071
can literally provide anything
a human being could ask for,

24:14.239 --> 24:16.148
in unlimited quantity.

24:16.325 --> 24:19.242
Yes, I know. That's what worries me.
How will my crew react in a world

24:19.411 --> 24:23.325
where they can have absolutely
everything they want simply by...

24:23.499 --> 24:25.041
...asking for it?

24:29.171 --> 24:31.744
- You desire something, lord?
- You desire something, lord?

24:31.924 --> 24:34.047
Oh, yes, thank you.

24:36.595 --> 24:39.596
- You're Alice 118.
- 118.

24:39.765 --> 24:43.051
- And you're Alice 322.
- 322.

24:44.562 --> 24:47.479
Well, it doesn't make much difference,
you're both lovely.

24:47.648 --> 24:49.440
- Thank you, my lord.
- Thank you, my lord.

24:49.608 --> 24:51.518
You desire something else, lord?

24:59.952 --> 25:03.571
- What a shame you're not real.
- We are real, my lord.

25:06.459 --> 25:10.291
- Oh, I mean real girls.
- We are programmed to function

25:10.463 --> 25:13.298
- as human females, lord.
- You are?

25:13.466 --> 25:15.293
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

25:15.468 --> 25:17.176
Harry Mudd programmed you?

25:17.345 --> 25:18.720
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

25:19.305 --> 25:21.464
That unprincipled,
evil-minded, lecherous

25:21.641 --> 25:23.550
kulak Harry Mudd programmed you?

25:23.727 --> 25:26.052
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

25:27.063 --> 25:30.100
This place is even better
than Leningrad.

25:34.154 --> 25:36.312
Absolutely fantastic.

25:36.490 --> 25:41.199
Handworked to the finest tolerances.
Microvision and a nanopulse laser.

25:41.370 --> 25:43.113
I've never seen the like before.

25:43.288 --> 25:45.993
You may command us
to make anything for you,

25:46.291 --> 25:49.625
or do the work yourself,
for pleasure.

25:49.795 --> 25:52.500
You may have the services
of any number of craftsmen,

25:52.673 --> 25:56.338
exclusive use of
the computer facilities.

25:56.510 --> 25:58.134
Anything.

25:58.303 --> 26:00.213
Captain, you should see this shop.

26:00.389 --> 26:02.962
Why, they have facilities
we never even thought of.

26:03.142 --> 26:04.766
Is that the way
you're gonna do it, Mudd?

26:04.935 --> 26:06.844
Hit my people
at their weakest point?

26:07.021 --> 26:11.184
We only wish to make you
happy and comfortable, captain.

26:11.358 --> 26:16.020
If we are to serve your kind,
we must understand you.

26:16.197 --> 26:18.604
Our Lord, Harry Mudd,

26:18.783 --> 26:21.024
was only one example for us.

26:21.369 --> 26:25.318
Now we are learning
a great deal from all of you.

26:26.832 --> 26:30.202
Here we are, birds in a gilded cage.
Question is, how do we get out?

26:30.795 --> 26:34.543
I don't know, sir,
but it's a very nice gilded cage.

26:35.675 --> 26:38.130
And it is a very pleasant
place, captain.

26:38.845 --> 26:40.802
What did they offer you, Uhura?

26:40.972 --> 26:43.380
Nothing really important, just...

26:44.058 --> 26:45.850
...immortality.

26:47.729 --> 26:51.477
All right. We're getting back to
the ship, and don't you forget it.

26:51.649 --> 26:53.227
Straighten up.

26:53.401 --> 26:55.857
This may be a gilded cage,

26:56.237 --> 26:58.396
filled with everything you want,
but it's still a cage.

26:58.573 --> 27:00.198
We don't belong here.

27:01.534 --> 27:03.159
We belong on that ship, up there.

27:03.328 --> 27:05.534
Do you require something, lord?

27:05.705 --> 27:08.659
No. Yes, my ship.

27:08.834 --> 27:12.416
- I am not programmed...
- To respond in that area. Yes, I know.

27:12.587 --> 27:15.505
Is there anything any of you require,
to please you?

27:15.674 --> 27:17.168
Alice...

27:18.427 --> 27:20.918
...give us back our ship,
to please us.

27:21.096 --> 27:23.765
Return us to our ship,
because we desire it.

27:24.600 --> 27:26.308
We are programmed to serve.

27:26.477 --> 27:29.431
We shall serve you to your
best interests to make you happy.

27:29.605 --> 27:31.063
But we're unhappy here.

27:32.024 --> 27:34.266
Please explain "unhappy."

27:34.777 --> 27:37.446
Unhappiness is the state
which occurs in the human

27:37.613 --> 27:40.614
when wants and desires
are not fulfilled.

27:40.783 --> 27:43.274
Which wants and desires of yours
are not fulfilled?

27:43.452 --> 27:45.575
We want the Enterprise.

27:53.713 --> 27:56.464
The Enterprise is not
a want or a desire.

27:56.632 --> 27:58.921
It is a mechanical device.

27:59.093 --> 28:02.047
No, it's a beautiful lady,
and we love her.

28:03.389 --> 28:08.466
Illogical. Illogical. All units relate.
All units. Norman, coordinate.

28:12.940 --> 28:15.645
"Unhappiness" does not relate.
We must study this.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.615
- Interesting.
- Fascinating.

28:26.663 --> 28:30.992
Bones, have you had time to take any
psychological readings of the androids?

28:31.167 --> 28:33.837
I did, and you can forget it.
They're perfect.

28:34.004 --> 28:35.581
Flawless, mentally and physically.

28:35.755 --> 28:37.547
No weaknesses,
perfectly disciplined.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.836
No vices, no fears, no faults.
Just a sense of purpose.

28:41.344 --> 28:44.678
Believe me, there's nothing tougher
to overcome, even among humans.

28:45.682 --> 28:49.431
Yes, that's what this crew needs,
a little sense of purpose.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.191
Mudd.
A few questions I want to ask you.

28:58.362 --> 29:01.232
Afraid I won't have time to answer
them. My bags are all packed.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.657
The androids will take the Enterprise
out of orbit in less than 24 hours.

29:04.827 --> 29:07.578
But it's been a real pleasure
having you here, Kirk.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.240
Is there anything I can get for you?

29:09.415 --> 29:10.873
Yes. My ship.

29:11.041 --> 29:13.164
You're a stubborn fellow, aren't you?

29:13.335 --> 29:17.250
But I don't mind, not at all, because
I'll be leaving here quickly enough.

29:17.423 --> 29:21.088
And then you can be stubborn
at your own leisure.

29:21.469 --> 29:23.508
One last time.

29:31.395 --> 29:33.388
Stella, dear.

29:33.564 --> 29:36.234
Harcourt Fenton Mudd,
where have you been?

29:36.400 --> 29:38.393
What have you been up to?

29:38.569 --> 29:42.733
Have you been drinking again?
You miserable sot!

29:42.907 --> 29:46.656
- You good-for-nothing...
- Shut up!

29:53.751 --> 29:56.207
Alice Number 2, my little love.

29:56.379 --> 29:59.380
Will you have my bags
transported up to the ship?

29:59.549 --> 30:03.250
- No, my Lord Mudd!
- What?!

30:03.428 --> 30:05.753
We can no longer take your orders,
Harry Mudd.

30:06.264 --> 30:07.343
Why not?

30:07.515 --> 30:11.264
Our makers were wise.
They programmed us to serve.

30:11.436 --> 30:14.520
Yes, but that's what I'm saying.
Put my bags on the ship.

30:14.689 --> 30:16.433
I think they have
something else in mind.

30:16.608 --> 30:18.435
You are correct, captain.

30:18.610 --> 30:22.275
Harry Mudd is flawed,
even for a human being.

30:22.447 --> 30:24.025
We recognised this
from the beginning,

30:24.199 --> 30:26.951
but used his knowledge
to obtain more specimens.

30:27.119 --> 30:29.195
Your species is self-destructive.

30:29.371 --> 30:32.787
- You need our help.
- We prefer to help ourselves.

30:32.958 --> 30:34.701
We make mistakes,
but we're human.

30:34.877 --> 30:37.450
And maybe that's the word
that best explains us.

30:37.629 --> 30:39.289
We will not harm you.

30:39.465 --> 30:41.457
But we will take the starship

30:41.633 --> 30:44.171
and you will remain on this planet.

30:44.345 --> 30:47.429
Now, look here, you can't do that!

30:47.598 --> 30:50.599
Now, listen, to serve us,
you must obey us.

30:50.768 --> 30:53.306
No, my Lord Mudd.

30:54.438 --> 30:58.650
Alice Number 1. Obey me.
Put my bags on that ship!

31:03.656 --> 31:07.488
We cannot allow any race
as greedy and corruptible as yours

31:07.827 --> 31:10.069
to have free run of the galaxy.

31:10.246 --> 31:12.951
I'm curious, Norman,
just how do you intend to stop them?

31:13.124 --> 31:14.583
We shall serve them.

31:14.751 --> 31:18.120
Their kind will be eager
to accept our service.

31:18.296 --> 31:21.499
Soon, they will become
completely dependent upon us.

31:21.966 --> 31:25.916
Their aggressive and acquisitive
instincts will be under our control.

31:26.095 --> 31:29.013
We shall take care of them.

31:29.849 --> 31:31.889
Eminently practical.

31:32.060 --> 31:35.511
The whole galaxy,
controlled by your kind?

31:35.689 --> 31:37.147
Yes, captain.

31:37.315 --> 31:40.482
And we shall serve them,
and you will be happy...

31:41.319 --> 31:42.695
...and controlled.

31:50.537 --> 31:53.621
So far, this thing has had
its amusing aspects.

31:53.790 --> 31:55.498
But that threat the androids made

31:55.667 --> 31:58.372
about taking over all the humans
in the galaxy is not very funny.

31:58.837 --> 32:00.212
Indeed it is not.

32:00.380 --> 32:02.539
They may quite possibly
be able to accomplish it.

32:02.716 --> 32:04.839
Take my word for it, they can.

32:05.552 --> 32:08.008
Whatever method we use to
stop them, we must make haste.

32:08.180 --> 32:11.466
They have only to install some
cybernetic devices on the Enterprise

32:11.642 --> 32:13.350
and they'll be able to leave orbit.

32:13.519 --> 32:15.844
- How do you know so much?
- I asked them.

32:17.564 --> 32:21.016
Why shouldn't they answer us?
They don't think we can stop them.

32:21.902 --> 32:23.895
You're so smart, Kirk.

32:24.071 --> 32:27.274
You, and this pointy-eared
thinking machine of yours.

32:27.450 --> 32:28.992
Well, you'd better do something

32:29.160 --> 32:31.733
because I'm as anxious to get off
this ruddy rock as you are.

32:31.912 --> 32:34.617
I seem to remember that you wanted
to leave us on this ruddy rock

32:34.790 --> 32:36.071
and leave by yourself!

32:36.292 --> 32:37.572
Well...

32:37.752 --> 32:39.376
All right, what have we got
to work with?

32:39.545 --> 32:42.748
Well, captain,
androids and robots,

32:42.924 --> 32:45.296
they're just not capable of
independent, creative thought.

32:45.468 --> 32:48.635
Yet, the device that Norman claims
to be their central control

32:48.805 --> 32:52.719
is totally inadequate to the task of
directing more than 200,000 of them.

32:52.892 --> 32:54.055
I agree.

32:54.227 --> 32:56.266
What, in your opinion,
does direct them?

32:56.437 --> 32:59.189
There are a large number
of Alices, of Trudys,

32:59.357 --> 33:03.058
Maisies, Annabelles,
and according to my research,

33:03.278 --> 33:07.607
a Herman series, an Oscar series,
a whole plethora of series, in fact...

33:08.491 --> 33:11.492
...but only one Norman.

33:13.038 --> 33:14.496
Norman.

33:15.498 --> 33:17.906
When I told one of the Alices

33:18.084 --> 33:20.492
that the Enterprise was a lovely lady
and we loved her

33:20.670 --> 33:25.214
she said, "Norman, coordinate."
Why Norman? Unless...

33:25.384 --> 33:29.002
To function as they do, each
android mind must be one component

33:29.179 --> 33:33.047
of a mass brain,
linked through a central locus.

33:33.225 --> 33:34.256
Named Norman.

33:34.643 --> 33:38.261
Forming one gigantic,
highly intelligent mind.

33:38.438 --> 33:40.930
And the glowing badges...

33:41.942 --> 33:43.982
...they indicate the mind
in operation.

33:44.403 --> 33:47.570
- That would seem logical.
- Yes, logical, that's what it is.

33:47.740 --> 33:50.278
And that in turn gives us a weapon
we can use against them.

33:50.451 --> 33:56.489
We must use wild, insane, irrational
illogic aimed right at Norman!

33:56.832 --> 33:59.786
Captain, you sing and dance as well
as anyone I've ever seen,

33:59.960 --> 34:02.451
but what the devil
are you talking about?

34:02.630 --> 34:06.841
What would seem to be a sound,
and perhaps our only, opportunity.

34:07.468 --> 34:09.342
Opportunity?

34:09.512 --> 34:12.264
Now, listen, Spock, you may be
a wonderful science officer,

34:12.431 --> 34:16.014
but believe me, you couldn't sell
fake patents to your mother.

34:16.185 --> 34:20.016
I fail to understand why I should
care to induce my mother

34:20.188 --> 34:22.312
to purchase falsified patents.

34:24.819 --> 34:27.690
- Forget it.
- Let's get to the point.

34:27.864 --> 34:29.856
Harry, you said you wanted to help.
Do you?

34:30.199 --> 34:33.900
Captain, the kind of a wholesome,
antiseptic galaxy

34:34.078 --> 34:37.661
that these androids would run
would be purgatory for a man like me.

34:37.831 --> 34:39.373
That's fine, Harry.

34:39.542 --> 34:42.661
The androids will be expecting us
to make a break for it.

34:42.837 --> 34:44.830
- That's where you come in.
- What can I do?

34:45.005 --> 34:46.998
Nothing, Harry, just...

34:48.342 --> 34:49.373
...go to sleep.

34:49.553 --> 34:51.130
What..? What do you mean?

34:51.304 --> 34:53.974
Oh, no, now,
wait a minute, gentlemen.

34:54.141 --> 34:57.426
What I had in mind was
actually more on the line

34:57.602 --> 35:01.932
of a few words of sage counsel,
as it were, advice.

35:03.066 --> 35:05.438
Harry, I do believe
you're putting on weight.

35:09.489 --> 35:10.948
Yes?

35:11.116 --> 35:13.239
We have a medical problem.

35:13.410 --> 35:15.035
Your ex-lord, Harry Mudd.

35:15.204 --> 35:17.659
He is human.
You will have to care for him.

35:17.831 --> 35:20.832
We are caring for him, but our doctor
needs his medical equipment

35:21.001 --> 35:22.032
aboard the Enterprise.

35:22.211 --> 35:24.749
The starship is forbidden
to humans.

35:25.089 --> 35:26.832
You are programmed to serve.

35:27.007 --> 35:29.498
If we're not allowed access
to our medical equipment,

35:29.677 --> 35:32.346
Harry Mudd will die.
He will cease to function.

35:32.513 --> 35:35.086
You will have failed to serve.

35:41.063 --> 35:43.352
I am directed to
observe the situation.

35:52.450 --> 35:55.119
- He is malfunctioning.
- He is dying.

35:55.495 --> 35:57.986
If you take him to your Sickbay,
will he be repaired?

35:58.164 --> 35:59.575
- Oh, yes.
- No.

36:00.166 --> 36:02.289
They're lying. It's a trick.

36:02.460 --> 36:07.003
Dr. McCoy injected something
in Harry Mudd to make him look sick.

36:07.173 --> 36:11.586
It's a trick to get back on board
and sabotage the ship.

36:11.761 --> 36:14.299
- The request is refused.
- Uhura, why did you tell her?

36:14.472 --> 36:16.798
Because I want an android body.

36:16.975 --> 36:19.217
I want immortality.

36:19.394 --> 36:22.763
I'll live forever, captain.
I'll be young and beautiful.

36:22.939 --> 36:26.273
You have been of assistance.
We shall fulfill our obligation.

36:27.444 --> 36:28.475
Thank you.

36:28.653 --> 36:31.607
The programming for your body
will be completed before we leave.

36:36.328 --> 36:37.988
Uhura...

36:40.040 --> 36:41.368
...beautiful!

36:41.542 --> 36:43.415
I half believed it myself.

36:43.585 --> 36:46.420
Well, the androids
were expecting an attempt.

36:46.588 --> 36:48.332
- And now we've made it.
- What's next?

36:48.507 --> 36:53.169
Next, we take the Alices
on a trip through Wonderland.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.845
- Do you require something?
- Do you require something?

37:04.023 --> 37:06.181
Yes. Your attention.

37:26.379 --> 37:29.463
- What are they doing?
- They're celebrating.

37:32.969 --> 37:34.878
What are they celebrating?

37:35.054 --> 37:36.679
Their captivity.

37:45.774 --> 37:48.858
- Do you enjoy the music?
- Music?

37:51.821 --> 37:53.316
Music?

37:59.579 --> 38:01.905
Thank you, gentlemen.

38:02.082 --> 38:03.493
Thank you, lovely lady.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.743
You dance divinely.

38:05.919 --> 38:08.754
Thank you, kind sir.

38:09.381 --> 38:12.133
- Why does she strike him?
- She likes him.

38:14.052 --> 38:16.045
Mr. Chekov.

38:16.221 --> 38:18.428
The floor is no place for an officer.
Attention!

38:20.058 --> 38:22.347
Now stand absolutely still.

38:22.519 --> 38:24.477
Yes, captain.

38:34.448 --> 38:35.777
That's much better, Mr. Chekov.

38:39.495 --> 38:41.119
It is illogical.

38:41.288 --> 38:42.948
Your statement is illogical.

38:55.344 --> 38:56.803
How does it look?

38:56.971 --> 38:59.296
Completely inner-directed.
Oblivious to everything.

38:59.474 --> 39:01.762
Good. I wonder how Spock's doing.

39:03.144 --> 39:07.806
Of course. Your computations would
inevitably lead to a total description

39:07.982 --> 39:11.814
of the parabolic intersection
of dimension with dimension.

39:11.986 --> 39:16.031
Mr. Spock, you have a remarkably
logical and analytical mind.

39:16.199 --> 39:17.824
Thank you.

39:26.960 --> 39:29.831
Is there some significance
to this action?

39:36.803 --> 39:39.377
I love you.

39:40.098 --> 39:42.424
However, I hate you.

39:42.601 --> 39:46.812
But I am identical in every way
with Alice 27.

39:46.980 --> 39:49.934
Yes, of course.
That is exactly why I hate you,

39:50.108 --> 39:52.101
because you are identical.

40:04.707 --> 40:06.331
Fascinating.

40:10.379 --> 40:13.546
All right, it's worked so far,
but we're not out yet.

40:14.216 --> 40:16.008
- Well?
- Success, captain.

40:16.177 --> 40:18.253
We've pruned the leaves
and branches of the tree.

40:18.429 --> 40:20.137
Now it is time to
get to work on the root.

40:20.306 --> 40:23.390
If Norman is the control centre,
he'll be in a bind by what we've done.

40:23.559 --> 40:24.970
If we can overload him further,

40:25.144 --> 40:27.101
we should be able
to immobilise all of them.

40:27.271 --> 40:28.931
Does everybody remember
what to do?

40:29.106 --> 40:31.562
- Affirmative.
- Acknowledged?

40:38.866 --> 40:41.737
What are you doing here?

40:41.911 --> 40:43.571
I want you to surrender.

40:43.746 --> 40:45.289
That is illogical.

40:45.456 --> 40:47.698
We can move
more quickly than you.

40:47.876 --> 40:50.580
We are invulnerable to attack.

40:50.754 --> 40:53.589
- We are much stronger.
- No, we are stronger.

40:53.757 --> 40:55.714
And I'll prove it to you.

40:56.343 --> 40:59.130
Can you harm a man that you're
programmed to serve?

40:59.304 --> 41:00.798
No.

41:03.016 --> 41:06.634
But you already have,
Norman, laddie.

41:06.812 --> 41:11.770
Human beings do not survive on bread
alone, you poor soulless creature,

41:11.942 --> 41:14.896
but on the nourishments of liberty.

41:15.070 --> 41:17.739
For what, indeed,
is a man without freedom?

41:17.906 --> 41:22.652
Nought but a mechanism
trapped in the cogwheels of eternity.

41:24.121 --> 41:26.612
You offer us only well-being.

41:26.790 --> 41:28.866
Food and drink and happiness
mean nothing to us.

41:29.043 --> 41:31.000
We must be about our job.

41:31.170 --> 41:35.167
Suffering in torment and pain,
labouring without end.

41:35.341 --> 41:38.342
Dying and crying
and lamenting over our burdens.

41:38.510 --> 41:43.089
- Only this way can we be happy.
- Only this way can we be happy.

41:47.561 --> 41:49.768
That is contradictory.

41:49.939 --> 41:52.940
It is not logical.

41:53.109 --> 41:54.936
Mr. Spock.

41:56.654 --> 41:59.026
- Explain.
- Why not?

41:59.866 --> 42:03.365
Logic is a little tweeting bird,
chirping in a meadow.

42:03.536 --> 42:08.412
Logic is a wreath of pretty flowers
which smell bad.

42:10.335 --> 42:12.623
Are you sure your circuits
are registering correctly?

42:12.795 --> 42:14.918
Your ears are green.

42:18.801 --> 42:21.506
I cannot go on.

42:21.679 --> 42:23.637
I'm tired of happiness.

42:23.807 --> 42:27.851
I'm tired of comfort and pleasure.
I'm ready!

42:28.019 --> 42:31.305
Kill me! Kill me!

42:34.860 --> 42:37.315
Goodbye, cruel universe.

42:44.703 --> 42:46.031
He's dead.

42:46.204 --> 42:49.205
You cannot have killed him.

42:50.042 --> 42:51.287
You have no weapons.

42:51.835 --> 42:55.038
Scotty! Scotty's dead.

42:55.214 --> 42:58.168
He had too much happiness.
But now he's happier. He's dead.

42:58.342 --> 42:59.540
And we'll miss him.

43:01.053 --> 43:03.758
Let us hear it for
our poor dead friend.

43:06.475 --> 43:09.393
What is a man but that lofty spirit,

43:09.561 --> 43:11.887
that sense of enterprise,

43:12.064 --> 43:14.899
that devotion to something
that cannot be sensed,

43:15.067 --> 43:19.065
cannot be realised,
but only dreamed?

43:19.238 --> 43:20.780
The highest reality!

43:20.948 --> 43:24.732
Brilliant! Bravo! Bravo, captain!

43:24.910 --> 43:28.326
- How did you like it?
- That is irrational, illogical.

43:28.497 --> 43:30.205
Dreams are not real.

43:30.541 --> 43:33.293
Our logic is to be illogical.
That is our advantage.

43:33.461 --> 43:36.711
Mr. Spock, it is time. The explosive.

43:36.881 --> 43:38.459
Very well, captain.

43:41.844 --> 43:43.718
- Explosive!
- Don't panic.

43:43.888 --> 43:45.715
Women and children first.

43:48.351 --> 43:52.265
Mr. Spock, isn't that too much
for our purposes?

43:53.064 --> 43:56.184
I believe that is
the correct amount, captain.

44:02.115 --> 44:04.867
- Mr. Mudd, are you ready?
- Aye, aye.

44:05.035 --> 44:07.952
Careful. I would not
want you to drop it.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.328
Easy.

44:13.585 --> 44:15.245
Watch it! Watch it!

44:25.222 --> 44:26.716
Detonator.

44:28.141 --> 44:29.470
Fuse.

44:30.644 --> 44:31.889
Primer.

44:33.981 --> 44:35.641
Mashie.

44:37.317 --> 44:39.310
There is no explosive!

44:39.486 --> 44:41.479
No? Observe!

44:41.655 --> 44:43.648
Fore!

44:49.622 --> 44:51.282
Are you all right?

44:58.130 --> 45:00.882
But there was no explosion.

45:01.050 --> 45:02.378
- I lied.
- But...

45:02.552 --> 45:04.877
He lied.
Everything Harry tells you is a lie.

45:05.054 --> 45:07.260
Remember that.
Everything Harry tells you is a lie.

45:07.431 --> 45:10.183
Now, listen to this carefully,
Norman.

45:10.351 --> 45:12.842
I am lying.

45:13.020 --> 45:15.179
You say you are lying,

45:15.356 --> 45:18.310
but if everything you say is a lie,
then you are telling the truth.

45:18.484 --> 45:22.185
But you cannot tell the truth,
because everything you say is a lie.

45:22.363 --> 45:26.741
But you lie... You tell the truth
but you cannot, for you lie...

45:26.910 --> 45:28.819
Illogical. Illogical.

45:28.995 --> 45:30.454
Please explain.

45:30.622 --> 45:34.240
You are human. Only humans
can explain their behaviour.

45:34.417 --> 45:35.662
Please explain.

45:35.835 --> 45:39.251
I am not programmed
to respond in that area.

45:49.224 --> 45:51.976
- I believe they are all immobilized.
- Good.

45:52.144 --> 45:55.145
Kirk, old man, I'm beginning to
develop considerable respect for you.

45:55.314 --> 45:56.393
Why, thank you.

45:56.565 --> 45:58.937
Would you consider entering
a partnership arrangement with me?

45:59.109 --> 46:00.936
I've got some ideas.

46:01.111 --> 46:03.781
A partnership arrangement?
You and me?

46:03.947 --> 46:06.106
- Yes.
- I've got something else in mind.

46:06.283 --> 46:07.777
Let's go.

46:08.410 --> 46:11.447
Well, you must be very unhappy,
Mr. Spock.

46:11.622 --> 46:15.287
That is a human emotion, doctor,
with which I'm totally unfamiliar.

46:15.459 --> 46:17.250
How could I be unhappy?

46:17.419 --> 46:20.753
Well, we found a whole world
of minds that work just like yours:

46:20.923 --> 46:24.209
Logical, unemotional,
completely pragmatic.

46:24.385 --> 46:28.335
And we poor, irrational humans
whipped them in a fair fight.

46:28.514 --> 46:32.927
Now you'll find yourself back
among us illogical humans again.

46:33.102 --> 46:35.675
Which I find
eminently satisfactory, doctor.

46:35.855 --> 46:38.607
For nowhere am I so
desperately needed

46:38.774 --> 46:41.775
as among a shipload
of illogical humans.

46:41.944 --> 46:43.225
Touché, Bones.

46:43.404 --> 46:45.776
I've never heard
of anything so revolting.

46:45.948 --> 46:47.608
We'll soon get to the bottom of this...

46:47.784 --> 46:51.235
Kirk, now, what's all this I hear
about my having to stay here?

46:51.412 --> 46:54.746
Yes, Mudd, you've been paroled
to the android population of this planet.

46:54.916 --> 46:56.743
The androids are
being reprogrammed.

46:56.918 --> 47:00.417
Their original purpose was to adapt
this planet for productive use.

47:00.588 --> 47:02.711
They'll begin that work again.

47:02.882 --> 47:06.382
But what do I do?
Kirk, I'm no scientist.

47:06.553 --> 47:08.095
No, you're an irritant.

47:08.263 --> 47:10.635
You'll stay here and provide
a first-class example

47:10.807 --> 47:12.716
to the androids of a human failure.

47:12.893 --> 47:16.807
They'll learn by close observation how
to avoid ones like you in the future.

47:16.980 --> 47:18.143
How long?

47:18.315 --> 47:22.478
As long as you continue to be
an irritant, Harry. It's up to you.

47:29.117 --> 47:30.493
Well...

47:31.328 --> 47:34.993
...I suppose that,

47:35.165 --> 47:39.708
taking everything into
consideration, as it were,

47:39.878 --> 47:45.833
and noting all the different
possibilities, I could manage.

47:46.010 --> 47:49.011
And as detention sentences go,

47:49.179 --> 47:51.635
this one isn't

47:51.807 --> 47:55.259
too uncomfortable.

47:56.187 --> 47:59.223
And I'm back in the galaxy again.

47:59.398 --> 48:01.687
Yes, you are.
There's one more thing, Harry.

48:01.859 --> 48:04.350
We've programmed
a special android attendant

48:04.528 --> 48:06.188
to take care of your every need.

48:06.364 --> 48:10.527
She'll help you find an incentive to work
with the androids, not exploit them.

48:10.701 --> 48:14.746
I call that unexpectedly
civil of you, captain.

48:14.914 --> 48:17.666
- Yes.
- Harcourt!

48:18.376 --> 48:21.792
Harcourt Fenton Mudd,
what have you been up to?

48:21.963 --> 48:24.205
Have you been drinking again?
You answer me!

48:24.382 --> 48:25.710
Stella, shut up!

48:25.883 --> 48:28.125
- You miserable, conniving toad!
- I order you, shut up!

48:28.303 --> 48:31.220
Going out all night
and giving me those silly stories!

48:31.556 --> 48:33.299
Harcourt!

48:34.851 --> 48:36.642
Harcourt Fenton Mudd!

48:36.811 --> 48:39.516
You've been overeating again,
and drinking!

48:40.523 --> 48:45.316
Kirk! You can't do this to me!
It's inhuman!

48:45.487 --> 48:47.526
I see I've got my work
cut out for me.

48:47.697 --> 48:48.777
Harcourt!

48:48.949 --> 48:50.906
Have you ever seen
a worm in alcohol?

48:51.076 --> 48:54.990
- You're on a regular schedule!
- Number 500?

48:59.251 --> 49:01.078
What have you been up to?!

49:03.088 --> 49:05.626
Kirk! Kirk, you can't do this to me!

49:05.841 --> 49:07.715
It's inhuman, Kirk!

49:10.596 --> 49:12.838
Goodbye, Harry. Have fun.
