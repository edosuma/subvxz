WEBVTT

00:09.000 --> 00:12.102
- And, uh, as you can see
from the locations,

00:12.167 --> 00:14.400
the killer is working
primarily in the southern,

00:14.501 --> 00:16.768
central and southeastern,
which makes sense

00:16.901 --> 00:19.470
given the concentrations
of homeless in those districts.

00:19.569 --> 00:21.037
Vics one and three
were killed at night,

00:21.134 --> 00:23.468
two and four
had daylight t.o.d.s.

00:23.568 --> 00:26.402
- Detective, what about
the missing man, Mr. Butler?

00:26.534 --> 00:29.103
Is there any lead at all
on his whereabouts?

00:29.202 --> 00:30.934
- No, sir.
We, uh--

00:31.036 --> 00:34.269
We have teletypes with every
police agency in the mid-atlantic,

00:34.368 --> 00:35.937
we're also running
daily morguehecks

00:36.036 --> 00:37.536
in ten states
and the district,

00:37.634 --> 00:40.267
but uh--
Nothing yet.

00:40.403 --> 00:41.670
- Where are we
on a profile?

00:41.736 --> 00:43.936
- I've arranged for our people
to travel to quantico today.

00:44.034 --> 00:46.034
The bureau's been
very accommodating.

00:46.101 --> 00:47.835
- I mean,
this is a strange one.

00:47.934 --> 00:49.834
I've heard of people
going after street people,

00:49.935 --> 00:51.869
but it's usually
adolescent sadism.

00:51.970 --> 00:53.037
This sexual thing--

00:53.204 --> 00:54.037
It is different.

00:54.136 --> 00:55.335
We put it out on vicap,

00:55.469 --> 00:57.237
and we have no hits anywhere
else in the country.

00:57.336 --> 00:59.403
- I mean, I'm all for a little
kinky shit now and then,

00:59.503 --> 01:03.604
but chewing
on a homeless fella?

01:03.701 --> 01:06.104
- You seem to be well grounded
in the case file, detective.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.469
What else do you need?

01:07.570 --> 01:10.504
- Well, we've developed a rough
list of those adult males

01:10.603 --> 01:13.871
who were briefly detained
by police near pier five

01:13.970 --> 01:16.738
soon after the suspect
made his last call.

01:16.871 --> 01:18.871
We'd like to put some of those
under surveillance.

01:18.971 --> 01:20.138
They're not suspects,

01:20.236 --> 01:22.404
but we wld consider them
persons of interest.

01:22.505 --> 01:24.638
We've also developed
a rough list

01:24.772 --> 01:28.974
of known adult white homosexual sex
offenders in these three districts.

01:29.071 --> 01:32.405
And, as we cull that list,
we would--

01:32.503 --> 01:34.436
We'd like to put some of those
under surveillance, too.

01:34.537 --> 01:35.706
About a dozen men.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.139
Less, actually.

01:37.237 --> 01:39.038
We should be able to eliminate
many of our potentials

01:39.137 --> 01:40.503
through retroactive
investigation.

01:40.603 --> 01:41.971
Do you have your people?

01:42.073 --> 01:44.906
- I've asked the chief of patrol
to detail sergeant ellis carver

01:45.039 --> 01:46.239
from the western
homicide

01:46.336 --> 01:48.871
for purposes of running
the surveillance element.

01:49.038 --> 01:50.171
- Why not a man
from one of the districts

01:50.338 --> 01:51.538
where the attacks
occurred?

01:51.605 --> 01:52.873
- Well, I've worked
with carver

01:52.972 --> 01:55.473
on prolonged investigations
in the past,

01:55.572 --> 02:00.841
and his familiary with
surveillance tactics is relevant.

02:00.974 --> 02:03.842
Also, I would be inclined to
trust his objective assessment

02:03.973 --> 02:05.840
when choosing
surveillance teams.

02:05.973 --> 02:07.073
Very good.

02:07.171 --> 02:09.304
If that works for patrol,
it works for operations.

02:09.437 --> 02:11.438
- What are we doing
to protect people?

02:11.538 --> 02:13.272
- Patrol and tactical
are running extra cars

02:13.372 --> 02:15.808
in all three districts
with special emphasis on posts

02:15.907 --> 02:17.273
where the homeless
congregate.

02:17.373 --> 02:19.241
We have ten undercovers,
dressed as vagrants,

02:19.341 --> 02:20.475
working
staggered shifts.

02:20.608 --> 02:23.641
- We're going to need
good undercover cars as well.

02:23.807 --> 02:27.175
And I'm told that motor pool
expects nothing back

02:27.273 --> 02:28.574
from dickman street
until--

02:28.674 --> 02:29.942
- Whatever you need,
detective.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.275
- Yes, Mr. Mayor, but we're
being told by public works--

02:32.406 --> 02:33.540
- Go to avis
if you have to, hertz.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.474
I don't give a shit.
People are disappearing.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.007
Theye dying,
for crissake.

02:37.108 --> 02:40.842
Just do what
you need to do.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.574
The bad news, gentlemen,

02:46.674 --> 02:48.842
is we're actually going to have
to catch this motherfucker.

02:50.574 --> 02:52.842
The good news is that our mayor
finally needs a police department

02:52.942 --> 02:54.576
more than he needs
a school system.

"A lie ain't a side of a story. It's just a lie."
- Terry Hanning.

05:00.847 --> 05:02.214
Yo, can I help you?

05:02.312 --> 05:03.815
I'm looking to work.

05:03.914 --> 05:05.116
Here?

05:05.216 --> 05:07.050
Yeah, you need anyone?

05:07.182 --> 05:08.216
How old are you?

05:08.314 --> 05:09.848
Eighteen.

05:10.017 --> 05:11.317
A-ight, man,
i'm fifteen.

05:11.448 --> 05:12.816
- I mean, yo, I can give you
a form to fill out,

05:12.916 --> 05:17.951
but the manager, he ain't gonna
hire no one under seventeen.

05:21.049 --> 05:24.349
Hey, yo.

05:24.416 --> 05:27.050
You used to run
with the boy namond, right?

05:27.149 --> 05:29.116
Yeah, I used to be
on them fayette corners.

05:29.248 --> 05:30.483
- Oh yeah, man,
I remember you.

05:30.583 --> 05:33.616
- Yeah, I just got tired,
ya know?

05:33.782 --> 05:35.615
Shit got old.

05:35.781 --> 05:37.850
So, I guess you need to bang
a while longer,

05:37.950 --> 05:46.452
then come back,
see if we got something.

05:46.485 --> 05:54.953
Then come back,
see if we got something.

05:55.083 --> 05:56.184
Why me?

05:56.283 --> 05:57.450
Why not somebody
from a district

05:57.551 --> 06:01.520
where they caught
one of your homeless cases?

06:01.619 --> 06:04.620
Well, there's a hitch.

06:12.452 --> 06:15.452
- This is some
fucked-up mcnulty shit.

06:15.553 --> 06:16.620
I don't want
to get burned here.

06:16.786 --> 06:18.086
And I don't want any
of my guys getting burned.

06:18.185 --> 06:19.987
Look, here's the deal.

06:20.086 --> 06:21.919
Command is throwing
more resources at me

06:22.017 --> 06:23.384
than I can use
on my homeless stuff.

06:23.486 --> 06:24.719
I got that covered.

06:24.817 --> 06:27.283
But lester--he's got
a fresh line on marlo stanfield,

06:27.384 --> 06:29.486
and he needs people
to run it down.

06:29.651 --> 06:30.752
A fresh line, huh?

06:30.852 --> 06:34.385
He's got a fuckin' wire up
is what you mean.

06:34.485 --> 06:36.919
- No, no, there's no--
There's no wire--

06:37.019 --> 06:38.755
- Who the fuck
are you kidding?

06:38.820 --> 06:43.253
I handed him a fresh cell number
for stanfield not two weeks ago.

06:43.353 --> 06:45.354
- Listen, I don't know anything
about any wire.

06:45.454 --> 06:47.621
I'm just saying he's got
a new line on marlo,

06:47.754 --> 06:50.921
and he needs people
to run it down.

06:51.019 --> 06:53.921
Bosses stiff-armed him?

06:54.019 --> 06:55.920
Jesus.

06:56.020 --> 06:58.222
Guy drops all those
motherfuckers in the vacants.

06:58.319 --> 07:00.320
Yeah.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.422
- So you're throwing
people over to lester,

07:03.588 --> 07:06.287
and paying for it
from your case, is that it?

07:06.422 --> 07:08.590
O.t. Out the ass.

07:10.789 --> 07:11.822
- What about
the paperwork?

07:11.921 --> 07:13.386
I'll take care of that.

07:13.553 --> 07:14.687
Althe run sheets,
office reports,

07:14.820 --> 07:15.920
they come through me.

07:16.055 --> 07:17.688
All your people got to do
is straight police work.

07:17.756 --> 07:18.957
Daniels gave me a free hand

07:19.056 --> 07:21.022
to pull people
from any district.

07:21.188 --> 07:29.856
Just make sure you send me
people who work.

07:30.055 --> 07:31.321
Mcnulty.

07:31.420 --> 07:33.221
What about cars?

07:33.354 --> 07:36.524
- Departmental account
at enterprise downtown.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.791
Get what ya need.

07:40.789 --> 07:42.790
- We delay fleet maintenance
for public works

07:42.890 --> 07:44.124
over the next
three months.

07:44.224 --> 07:48.591
We cut snow removal in half
and pray for global warming.

07:48.689 --> 07:51.123
That's enough to avoid
any ugly cuts in school funding,

07:51.253 --> 07:52.422
at least
for this quarter.

07:52.523 --> 07:54.323
- And this funds police
operations fully, correct?

07:54.423 --> 07:55.625
- They're back
to where they started

07:55.757 --> 07:56.690
before we bled them out.

07:56.789 --> 07:57.690
It's time anyway.

07:57.791 --> 07:59.158
We ducked
the teacher layoffs,

07:59.256 --> 08:00.957
and you got the fifteen points
on the third-grade m.s.a.s.

08:01.058 --> 08:02.225
You can live with that.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.558
But if we don't drop
the crime in this quarter,

08:03.656 --> 08:05.058
and the next,
you are lnerable.

08:05.158 --> 08:06.457
It's now or never.

08:06.556 --> 08:09.159
- Besides, you're getting
traction in this homeless thing.

08:09.258 --> 08:10.693
Governor was on y.p.r.
Yesterday,

08:10.791 --> 08:13.258
and steiner laid him out
for the state cutbacks.

08:13.357 --> 08:14.558
- Health care
for the homeless

08:14.624 --> 08:15.824
have asked for city hall's
steps tomorrow night.

08:15.923 --> 08:17.191
Candlelight vigil.

08:17.323 --> 08:18.456
You said yes, right?

08:18.558 --> 08:19.692
- Norman told 'em
they could do it

08:19.791 --> 08:24.559
if I got a chance to say
a few choice words, yeah.

08:24.690 --> 08:25.891
Speak of the devil.

08:25.991 --> 08:27.624
- I just got off the phone
with the "post."

08:27.725 --> 08:29.192
Reporter there wants
your comment

08:29.325 --> 08:31.725
on a story he's workin
about dobey, down in p.g.,

08:31.826 --> 08:33.894
looking to take you on
in the democratic primary.

08:33.991 --> 08:34.991
What?

08:35.092 --> 08:36.291
Dobey's getting in?

08:36.392 --> 08:38.626
- Make matters worse,
upshaw's telling people

08:38.725 --> 08:41.291
he might just throw in
with said county exec.

08:41.390 --> 08:44.659
Shit, we might have a full-blown
p.g. Insurrection on our hands.

08:44.760 --> 08:45.826
- Why the fuck
would they do that?

08:45.926 --> 08:47.626
- Lots of pissed off
black folks down there.

08:47.726 --> 08:51.193
Lot of grumblin' about always
a bridesmaid, never the bride.

08:51.291 --> 08:53.193
- No way can dobey
take the statehouse.

08:53.293 --> 08:54.728
All he's gonna do
is bloody us up

08:54.826 --> 08:56.828
and make uspend money
we're gonna need in the general.

08:56.925 --> 08:58.760
- When we went a-calling
in p.g. Last month,

08:58.893 --> 08:59.927
who'd you see?

09:00.027 --> 09:02.360
Steny.

09:02.460 --> 09:03.927
Maloney, miller,
those guys.

09:04.028 --> 09:05.461
White, white and white.

09:05.561 --> 09:08.862
Not even a cup of coffee with
poor old congressman upshaw.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.227
- I wasn't
snubbing the guy.

09:10.392 --> 09:12.495
- Folks down there are tired
of being taken for granted.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.229
- Fuck, I gotta kiss a ring,
don't i?

09:14.326 --> 09:17.661
- More than a ring,
actually.

09:17.759 --> 09:19.760
Unlimited o.t.

09:19.861 --> 09:21.326
That's what I'm told.

09:21.426 --> 09:23.427
- But you're sayin' we might not
be working the homeless cases.

09:23.560 --> 09:24.494
Not all the time.

09:24.593 --> 09:26.427
Major crimes
has a drug investigation

09:26.560 --> 09:28.227
that may also need
surveillance work.

09:28.327 --> 09:30.395
- Shit, who cares
what we work?

09:30.495 --> 09:32.129
I need the money.

09:32.229 --> 09:33.131
A-ight then.

09:33.230 --> 09:34.196
You'll be
working out of homicide.

09:34.295 --> 09:36.965
Report down there
to detective mcnulty.

09:37.062 --> 09:39.796
Oh yeah--

09:39.862 --> 09:42.129
Rented wheels
on the backlot.

09:42.230 --> 09:43.862
Fuckin' a.

09:43.894 --> 09:46.328
- Ah, man,
this is beautiful.

09:46.428 --> 09:50.530
Oh, hell yeah.

09:50.696 --> 09:51.963
- It's weird shit,
I gotta say.

09:52.063 --> 09:53.429
Talkin' to a psychopath
like that.

09:53.529 --> 09:57.263
- I interviewed
dick cheney once.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.331
Whaddaya you think, gus?

09:58.430 --> 09:59.498
Are we hyping this thing,

09:59.595 --> 10:00.863
or is templeton
writing as it lays?

10:00.963 --> 10:01.963
Police say it's real.

10:02.063 --> 10:03.863
- An' those photographs
he got sent?

10:03.965 --> 10:05.430
Hey, the guy's
fucking missing.

10:05.528 --> 10:08.165
- So I guess now we're writing
homeless stories till december, huh?

10:08.264 --> 10:09.331
Uh-huh.

10:09.431 --> 10:10.898
Why till december?

10:11.029 --> 10:14.263
- Pulitzer submissions
run the calendar year.

10:14.330 --> 10:16.364
Anything a newspaper
cares about at christmas,

10:16.430 --> 10:18.096
they give a fuck
about by new year's.

10:18.197 --> 10:21.563
Homelessness
it is there, gents.

10:23.263 --> 10:24.630
Hold on--

10:24.730 --> 10:26.065
Hold on--

10:26.164 --> 10:27.998
Fella down the lobby says
he wants to talk to an editor.

10:28.098 --> 10:29.464
What kind of editor?

10:29.564 --> 10:32.431
- The kind that worked on the
story about that homeless vet.

10:32.531 --> 10:33.731
Scott's piece?

10:33.831 --> 10:35.732
Sure they don't want
to talk to scott?

10:35.830 --> 10:37.898
- Ys templeton won't
take his calls anymore,

10:37.998 --> 10:42.466
so he walked over here
to talk to somebody else.

10:44.232 --> 10:47.533
Tell him
someone's coming down.

10:47.665 --> 10:50.566
That all he say?

10:50.665 --> 10:54.766
- Just walked up
and said he got savino.

10:54.866 --> 10:56.365
Said he gonna get
more of our muscle

10:56.466 --> 10:59.400
if marlo don't come
to the street and step to him.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.001
Good thing he didn't make me

11:04.199 --> 11:05.933

11:06.034 --> 11:08.768
He was limpin' bad, too.

11:08.931 --> 11:12.365
He had a crutch.

11:12.465 --> 11:16.000

11:18.933 --> 11:21.100
Everybody sayin'

11:21.199 --> 11:23.133
Heard he got a stash house

11:23.234 --> 11:24.136
Everybody's--

11:24.235 --> 11:27.802

shut the fuck up.

11:29.967 --> 11:32.300

11:55.137 --> 11:56.636
- Man got enough

11:56.736 --> 12:00.336

12:00.436 --> 12:02.637

12:22.037 --> 12:23.071
Nothing, man.

12:23.172 --> 12:25.072

We gotta get across town.

12:25.172 --> 12:27.039

12:27.139 --> 12:29.838
It's gonna tell you left,

12:29.936 --> 12:31.469
Pretty much blow you

12:31.568 --> 12:33.002
And look--

12:33.103 --> 12:36.736

school r&b shit on that, man.

12:36.835 --> 12:40.638
- New car, o.t.

12:40.738 --> 12:44.006
I hope we never catch
this goofy motherfucker.

12:44.104 --> 12:46.738
- Hey, officers.
Lookey here.

12:46.838 --> 12:49.738
You got two young bucks

12:49.838 --> 12:51.371
One in the white tee,

12:51.538 --> 12:52.738

Thanks, man.

12:58.839 --> 13:00.973
Yeah.

13:09.773 --> 13:11.205
Mr. Hanning?

13:11.305 --> 13:13.939
It's an honor for me
to meet you, sir.

13:14.038 --> 13:15.005
Who are you?

13:15.104 --> 13:16.138
My name's gus haynes.

13:16.204 --> 13:17.571
I edited the story
you're featured in.

13:17.671 --> 13:21.941
- Then you're
a fucking liar.

13:30.840 --> 13:34.175

14:50.743 --> 14:52.645
Four.

14:54.112 --> 14:55.478
Ya see there?

14:55.646 --> 14:59.013
Omar know which one it is.

14:59.111 --> 15:03.278
Look like all your muscle
done up and indisposed now.

15:03.376 --> 15:08.478
So you might as well go ahead
and drop it out, ya feel me?

15:12.379 --> 15:19.363
I'm a blast
to walk up in there now--

15:19.395 --> 15:26.346
I'm a blast
to walk up in there now--

15:26.479 --> 15:28.412
You workin'
a stanfield corner,

15:28.512 --> 15:31.313
which means you workin'
for a straight up punk.

15:31.412 --> 15:34.679
Ya feel me?

15:34.779 --> 15:36.846
I'm out here in these streets
every day.

15:36.945 --> 15:38.479
Me an' my lonesome.

15:38.579 --> 15:42.682
An' where he at?
huh?

16:03.881 --> 16:06.414
Yo, y'all put it
in his ear.

16:06.579 --> 16:08.981
Marlo stanfield
is not a man for this town.

16:09.116 --> 16:10.415
Ya dig?

16:10.581 --> 16:13.149
Mmm-hmm--

16:13.249 --> 16:15.615
Yeah--

16:17.882 --> 16:18.982
Yeah, eight men,
four cars.

16:19.115 --> 16:22.048
Ellis briefed 'em.
They know what's what.

16:24.183 --> 16:25.083
No, they're just happy
for the o.t.

16:25.183 --> 16:28.350
Look, don't worry, lester.

16:30.715 --> 16:34.650
- Just sign the motherfucker
and shut the fuck up.

16:43.084 --> 16:44.816
Gimme.

16:46.916 --> 16:47.884
We ready?

16:47.983 --> 16:49.151
'cause you gotta figure
an extra hour

16:49.251 --> 16:53.152
to get 'round the capital
beltway this time of day.

16:54.616 --> 16:56.350
You ever done
an f.b.i. Profile before?

16:56.449 --> 16:57.349
Once.

16:57.448 --> 16:59.215
How'd it go?

16:59.384 --> 17:00.383
Oh, they take your file,

17:00.482 --> 17:02.984
read you back some shit
you already know.

17:03.116 --> 17:04.083
Then why do it?

17:04.182 --> 17:07.750
So that we can saywe did.

17:14.184 --> 17:21.135
- Need a pack of newport.
Soft pack.

17:21.169 --> 17:28.088
- Need a pack of newport.
Soft pack.

17:28.253 --> 17:29.120
And let me get one
of them, too--

17:30.384 --> 17:37.418
Ahhhh!

17:37.485 --> 17:38.919
Don't shoot!

18:02.719 --> 18:04.419
- Lowenthal.
Where the fuck is he?

18:04.521 --> 18:07.687
Um, he's, uh--

18:07.787 --> 18:10.155
There you go, bunk.

18:10.254 --> 18:14.623
- Hey. Request for
a d.n.a. Comparison.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.988
case
Oh-six-h-two-seventy-one.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.421
Latent trace
to obtained samples.

18:18.521 --> 18:21.587
And it's a part of
the serial killer thing.

18:21.686 --> 18:23.321
It's now a part
of that investigation.

18:23.420 --> 18:24.421
Well, that's different.

18:24.521 --> 18:25.721
If it's connected
to that investigation--

18:25.855 --> 18:28.522
- It is.
It is, here.

18:28.621 --> 18:29.587
It's in my notes.

18:29.687 --> 18:31.489
- I never said
I was in a fire fight.

18:31.589 --> 18:32.590
Not on that day.

18:32.689 --> 18:34.190
- I'm sorry,
but you did.

18:34.257 --> 18:36.924
- I told you the lead vehicle
took a hit from an elevated i.e.d.

18:37.021 --> 18:38.089
Killed the fifty gunner,

18:38.189 --> 18:40.256
and blew the hands
off the driver.

18:40.354 --> 18:43.189
That's it.
That's enough, man.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.724
Why you go and make
the rest of that shit up?

18:44.823 --> 18:45.823
- I didn't make
anything up.

18:45.922 --> 18:47.288
We sat there
having coffee--

18:47.355 --> 18:48.288
Coffee--

18:48.356 --> 18:49.289
- Having donuts
and coffee.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.655
- And you said--
- What I say?

18:50.790 --> 18:52.288
- Can I finish?
- I don't know.

18:52.356 --> 18:54.523
I'm hearing about coffee
and donuts, I'm not hearing--

18:54.623 --> 18:57.623
- Can I finish? If you're not going
to let me tell my side of the story--

18:57.788 --> 18:59.155
- A lie ain't a side
of the story,

18:59.254 --> 19:00.189
it's just a lie.

19:00.288 --> 19:01.556
- I don't have to
listen to this--

19:01.623 --> 19:03.723
- Okay--hey, scott,
let's just relax here.

19:03.824 --> 19:07.259
Both you gentlemen, let's just
step back here, please?

19:07.423 --> 19:09.557
Now, Mr. Hanning,
forgive me,

19:09.657 --> 19:10.857
but do you drink much?

19:10.924 --> 19:13.925
- You think I fucking sleep
under a bridge sober?

19:14.023 --> 19:18.824
- Sometimes when I have a few--
And I do like to have a few--

19:18.922 --> 19:21.223
I tend to be a little more
descriptive in the telling of a tale.

19:21.289 --> 19:22.225
In fact--

19:22.391 --> 19:23.625
- I know what it
is to tell a story.

19:23.724 --> 19:26.625
I've told plenty
in my time.

19:28.391 --> 19:30.558
But there's some things
that happen,

19:30.658 --> 19:33.659
you don't ever
fuck with them.

19:35.657 --> 19:38.261
Scott?

19:43.225 --> 19:44.424
- I believe you,
mr. Hanning.

19:44.525 --> 19:46.958
I believe
that you believe.

19:47.058 --> 19:50.492
That you believe
you told me one thing.

19:50.591 --> 19:53.126
But, sir, with all
due respect and gratitude

19:53.224 --> 19:54.957
for you and the service
you gave to this country,

19:55.059 --> 19:56.792
you didn't tell me
that thing.

19:56.859 --> 19:58.493
You told me
something else.

19:58.593 --> 20:01.228
I wrote what
mr. Hanning told me.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.425
Mr. Hanning--

20:02.491 --> 20:03.491
- I know you probably--
- What if one of the guys,

20:03.592 --> 20:05.325
what if a marine
who was there--

20:05.492 --> 20:07.860
He reads that shit
that you made up?

20:07.958 --> 20:09.491
That's why
I come down here today.

20:09.592 --> 20:13.060
What if one of the guys
sees that?

20:13.227 --> 20:16.229
Man, get him
outta my face.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.795
- Guy's just off.
Off in general.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.429
Off his meds.
I dunno, but off.

20:33.528 --> 20:34.895
A lot of them are,
you know.

20:34.994 --> 20:37.629
- I mean, I hate to say it--
- Yeah, he puts on a good front.

20:37.796 --> 20:39.963
We'll call the marines,
get a service record,

20:40.061 --> 20:41.995
reach out to some people
in his unit,

20:42.061 --> 20:43.962
find out what the fuck happened
that day outside of--

20:44.059 --> 20:45.326
What was it?
Fallujah?

20:45.425 --> 20:47.226
Yeah.

20:47.327 --> 20:48.427
- Alright, if it went down
the way you said,

20:48.528 --> 20:50.029
we'll let it be.

20:50.161 --> 20:54.061
But if not, we'll chalk it up
as a misunderstanding.

20:54.162 --> 20:55.562
But misunderstanding or no,

20:55.631 --> 21:00.198
we will write a correction if
what we printed wasn't accurate.

21:05.196 --> 21:08.197
- And we didn't
have coffee.

21:08.295 --> 21:11.363
We had chocolate milk.

21:15.996 --> 21:19.430
- You Miss what you had,
though?

21:19.531 --> 21:23.932
- I still got too much dog in me
to be settled like that.

21:25.398 --> 21:30.100
It wasn't cheryl.
It was me.

21:30.196 --> 21:32.998
Thing is, is I found a connect
with the boy, you know?

21:33.131 --> 21:35.032
That part of it
feels right to me.

21:35.131 --> 21:37.833
Kids are great.

21:37.931 --> 21:40.564
Yeah.

21:40.664 --> 21:42.565
What about you an' beadie?

21:42.664 --> 21:46.564
You were quiet there
for a time.

21:46.663 --> 21:47.664
Yeah.

21:47.763 --> 21:49.663
Bunk once told me
i'm no good for people.

21:49.762 --> 21:52.197
Everyone around me,

21:52.298 --> 21:53.566
Was he drunk?

21:53.733 --> 21:55.666

21:57.499 --> 21:59.167
- Omar be dead.

22:20.766 --> 22:22.299

22:22.398 --> 22:25.432
He'da been better off.

22:25.599 --> 22:27.034
Thanks for calling.

22:27.135 --> 22:28.135

22:40.733 --> 22:44.067

22:44.168 --> 22:46.700

22:55.600 --> 22:57.168

several times a day.

24:17.805 --> 24:20.505
We're just trying to find
the pattern in the meets.

24:20.603 --> 24:21.871
- Where do we pick
these guys up?

24:21.972 --> 24:25.340
- Stanfield has every corner
between m.l.k. And monroe,

24:25.439 --> 24:28.573
and they start shaping it up
around eleven or so, okay?

24:28.673 --> 24:30.439
That's when the re-up orders
start coming in,

24:30.573 --> 24:33.773
that's when you'll start to see
monk making the rounds.

24:33.871 --> 24:36.572
Most mornings, marlo starts off
with a parley or two

24:36.672 --> 24:39.940
on the playground
between mosher and lanvale.

24:40.038 --> 24:41.872
Now, these guys
seem to be wholesaling, too.

24:41.972 --> 24:43.439
Other dealers,
players--

24:43.541 --> 24:46.641
Anyone who wants to get
with him gets him there, okay?

24:46.741 --> 24:49.242
Chris and snoop
are usually with him.

24:49.373 --> 24:52.140
And mcnulty's got you
covered for paperwork.

24:52.239 --> 24:54.773
None of what we do here
is necessary for court,

24:54.873 --> 24:57.641
so rest easy on that, alright?

24:57.808 --> 25:01.609
So we stage here
tomorrow at nine.

25:05.009 --> 25:06.276
No sign of him,

25:06.340 --> 25:09.408
but I ain't on nothin' else
for as long as it take.

25:09.541 --> 25:12.507
- You ain't heard?
Omar bagged up.

25:12.607 --> 25:14.910
Shit, I thought y'all
was gonna tell me.

25:15.043 --> 25:17.177
I just got the word myself
from monk.

25:17.277 --> 25:19.377
- Who got him?
- Some young boy.

25:19.474 --> 25:21.109
- Who?
- Ain't heard a name.

25:21.211 --> 25:23.077
Don't even know
if there was a why.

25:23.210 --> 25:26.442
Hopper wanna hear a pop,
see the damage, ya know?

25:26.540 --> 25:28.574
Yeah--
That shit is gone.

25:28.642 --> 25:30.009
We done
with this next resupply,

25:30.108 --> 25:35.476
you an' me got some time
in a.c. Coming to us, don't we?

25:35.574 --> 25:38.642
- Forensically, this guy
is all over the map.

25:38.809 --> 25:41.277
Sexual to a point,
but inhibited.

25:41.377 --> 25:44.212
Nocturnal on some,
diurnal on the others.

25:44.375 --> 25:46.441
And the notion of targeting
the homeless, to begin with?

25:46.543 --> 25:48.110
Well, we've only seen that
a couple times before,

25:48.210 --> 25:52.045
but in those instances, it's
been someone within that cohort.

25:52.143 --> 25:53.943
And they're not usually
carrying cell phones

25:54.044 --> 25:55.410
and calling newspapers.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.510
- You caught
a strange one here.

25:57.576 --> 25:59.578
- Detectives,
hey, don't get up.

25:59.676 --> 26:02.577
Arthur toland,
deputy director of the unit.

26:02.676 --> 26:03.776
Just wanted to drop by

26:03.844 --> 26:06.146
and make sure
we're progressing your case.

26:06.278 --> 26:07.310
Yeah, yeah.

26:07.409 --> 26:08.576
Great. Thanks.

26:08.676 --> 26:10.944
- You might recognize
the director from television.

26:11.044 --> 26:12.011
He's done all of them.

26:12.111 --> 26:13.577
- You know
those news shows.

26:13.678 --> 26:16.411
Always want a talking head
when a case comes up.

26:16.511 --> 26:20.479
Greta van susteren,
nancy grace, chris matthews,

26:20.579 --> 26:22.479
that fella with the big
forehead, whatshisname--

26:22.580 --> 26:23.980
Larry king?

26:24.079 --> 26:25.079
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:25.145 --> 26:26.345
Hey, what the hell.

26:26.511 --> 26:27.879
It's a chance to get the word
out for the bureau.

26:27.976 --> 26:32.144
And I sell some books.

26:32.211 --> 26:38.312
"human hunters: the rise
of the american serial killer"?

26:38.411 --> 26:40.612
They've used a lot of my stuff
on those c.s.i. Shows.

26:40.713 --> 26:44.981
I've consulted for them.

26:45.046 --> 26:47.479
You haven't heard--

26:47.579 --> 26:49.479
So, how long you been doing
death investigations?

26:49.578 --> 26:52.046
Eight years.

26:52.145 --> 26:54.511
We don't see a lot of
serial stuff actually.

26:54.611 --> 26:55.713
Drug murders.

26:55.847 --> 26:57.713
A street robbery
every now and then.

26:57.814 --> 26:59.347
- Three hundred or so
a year.

26:59.446 --> 27:02.015
- Well, you've got
a serial case now,

27:02.080 --> 27:03.646
so, I'll leave you to it.

27:03.779 --> 27:05.280
Good hunting.

27:05.380 --> 27:07.182
- Art was actually
lead investigator

27:07.283 --> 27:08.282
on the unabomber thing.

27:08.346 --> 27:11.016
- That was like
sixteen years, right?

27:11.146 --> 27:12.147
Yeah.

27:12.246 --> 27:21.783
- Yeah, then his brother
ratted him out?

27:21.914 --> 27:24.247
- Homeless is in
at thirty inches.

27:24.346 --> 27:26.981
It's good shit there.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.047
No really.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.581
There was a real
sense of place,

27:29.648 --> 27:31.381
especially under
the hanover bridge

27:31.481 --> 27:34.949
when the police came up
under there to give the warning.

27:35.082 --> 27:37.016
Drama in small moments
like that.

27:37.115 --> 27:39.081
- Truth is,
I had a tour guide.

27:39.182 --> 27:40.215
Yeah?

27:40.348 --> 27:41.582
- Yeah, fella I met
at a soup kitchen.

27:41.716 --> 27:42.650
Volunteer there.

27:42.749 --> 27:44.283
Ex-addict.

27:44.415 --> 27:45.849
There's something
about this guy.

27:45.915 --> 27:47.950
I mean, he's just--

27:48.117 --> 27:49.917
I dunno, the more he talked,
the more I felt like

27:50.083 --> 27:51.916
it was him I really
wanted to write about.

27:52.017 --> 27:53.484
- Yeah?
- But he's not homeless.

27:53.549 --> 27:55.016
And I don't have
any peg for him.

27:55.183 --> 27:56.916
Shit, I don't know
what the story is.

27:57.016 --> 27:58.184
Does he got a name?

27:58.284 --> 27:59.483
Reginald cousins.

27:59.549 --> 28:00.482
- Volunteers
at a soup kitchen.

28:00.549 --> 28:01.482
What's he do for money?

28:01.615 --> 28:03.017
- Sells the "baltimore sun"
every morning

28:03.117 --> 28:04.250
out by light street.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.751
- Well, shit not exactly
a growth industry, huh?

28:06.883 --> 28:08.417
- He lives
in his sister's basement.

28:08.516 --> 28:10.317
She'll take a plate down
to him every now and then,

28:10.417 --> 28:11.785
but she won't let him
come up the stairs.

28:11.919 --> 28:13.052
- Spend some time
with him.

28:13.151 --> 28:14.118
- What about
the neighborhoods beat?

28:14.218 --> 28:15.151
The homeless coverage?

28:15.217 --> 28:16.217
You're covered.

28:16.317 --> 28:18.151
Take a couple weeks,
see what you see.

28:18.217 --> 28:19.315
A-ight?

28:19.416 --> 28:21.118
- Late entries
from the copshop.

28:21.218 --> 28:22.852
Two dead in
a charles county housefire,

28:22.949 --> 28:24.582
and a homicide
from the city.

28:24.683 --> 28:26.051
- Ettlin,
what do we got room for?

28:26.218 --> 28:28.417
- We're shy one brief
in the metro digest.

28:28.482 --> 28:29.949
Four paragraphs'll fill.

28:30.050 --> 28:31.684
What's the homicide?

28:31.783 --> 28:33.651
- The 34-year-old
black male

28:33.718 --> 28:35.286
shot dead
in west baltimore grocery.

28:35.419 --> 28:38.520
Juvenile suspect
is being sought.

28:38.618 --> 28:40.052
Write up the fire.

28:40.084 --> 28:41.952
Scratch the murder.
We don't have room.

28:42.083 --> 28:44.984
- So what we conclude
from a behavioral analysis

28:45.152 --> 28:47.618
of the known forensics
is the following:

28:47.718 --> 28:48.884
the suspect is likely
a white male,

28:48.984 --> 28:50.685
in his late twenties
to late thirties.

28:50.785 --> 28:52.451
He likely is not
a college graduate,

28:52.586 --> 28:54.153
but feels
nonetheless superior

28:54.252 --> 28:56.053
to those with
advanced education,

28:56.153 --> 28:59.154
and he is likely employed
in a bureaucratic entity,

28:59.252 --> 29:01.785
possibly civil service
or quasi-public service,

29:01.886 --> 29:03.253
from which
heeels alienated.

29:03.352 --> 29:04.619
He has a problem
with authority

29:04.786 --> 29:06.987
and a deep-seated resentment
of those who he feels

29:07.052 --> 29:09.387
have impeded his progress
professionally.

29:09.454 --> 29:11.522
The minimized sexual activity
suggests

29:11.621 --> 29:14.022
that this is not a primary
motive for the killings.

29:14.088 --> 29:16.521
In fact, the bite marks
in the last found victim--

29:16.618 --> 29:18.386
Lacking the d.n.a. Of saliva--

29:18.520 --> 29:21.289
Indicate to us
possible post-mortem staging.

29:21.386 --> 29:23.519
The suspect has trouble
with lasting relationships

29:23.618 --> 29:26.451
and is possibly
a high-functioning alcoholic,

29:26.553 --> 29:28.354
with alcohol being utilized
as a trigger

29:28.452 --> 29:29.987
in the commission
of these crimes.

29:30.087 --> 29:31.054
His resentment
of the homeless

29:31.155 --> 29:32.822
may stem from
a personal relationship

29:32.921 --> 29:34.621
with someone
who is in that cohort,

29:34.720 --> 29:36.353
or his victimization
of vagrants

29:36.455 --> 29:38.289
might merely present
an opportunity for him

29:38.421 --> 29:43.257
to assert his superiority
and intellectual prowess.

29:43.386 --> 29:44.655
If you get more,
fax it down,

29:44.755 --> 29:52.724
and we can
update the profile.

29:52.924 --> 29:53.756
Thanks for everything.

29:53.855 --> 29:56.588
Thanks.

29:56.721 --> 29:58.588
So, what do you think?

29:58.722 --> 30:01.491
They're in the ballpark.

30:01.591 --> 30:04.125
- Look, congressman,
i'll do whatever it takes

30:04.223 --> 30:05.558
to make things right
between us,

30:05.657 --> 30:08.390
but running dobey in the primary
is only gonna hurt everybody.

30:08.490 --> 30:09.657
You mean hurt you.

30:09.756 --> 30:11.023
- All due respect,
i'm the only viable candidate

30:11.124 --> 30:13.558
to beat that republican prick,
and I know you know that.

30:13.655 --> 30:16.088
And, at the end of the day,
isn't that what it's all about?

30:16.190 --> 30:17.490
Do not waste your breath

30:17.588 --> 30:20.123
tellin' me what I already know
about our tax-cutting,

30:20.223 --> 30:23.522
dump-it-on-the-counties,
ass-kiss-every-business-interest governor.

30:23.587 --> 30:25.856
P.g. County has
a hundred murders a year,

30:25.956 --> 30:27.522
school system held together
with spit and glue,

30:27.656 --> 30:30.257
and worse rush-hour trafficthan atlanta.

30:30.389 --> 30:32.423
And the man in annapolis
wouldn't piss on us

30:32.490 --> 30:33.956
if we were on fire.

30:34.056 --> 30:35.858
- Don't hold back,
congressman.

30:35.958 --> 30:37.591
- I'm tired of these
fuckin' republicans.

30:37.691 --> 30:39.692
- Look, I fucked up
not coming to see you earlier.

30:39.791 --> 30:41.491
But between the votes
I can pull outta baltimore,

30:41.591 --> 30:44.960
montgomery and your county,
I am gonna take the statehouse.

30:45.057 --> 30:47.690
And then the frustration
that you feel is gonna end.

30:47.758 --> 30:50.192
I know you've heard this before
from every other sonofabitch,

30:50.291 --> 30:52.226
but congressman,
I give you my word.

30:52.324 --> 30:53.225
- You know,
you're right.

30:53.324 --> 30:56.159
I have heard that before.

30:56.259 --> 30:57.860
You wanna keep p.g. County
in your camp,

30:57.958 --> 31:02.060
it's gonna cost you
a lot more than your word.

31:45.994 --> 31:47.728
Fuck.

31:57.228 --> 31:59.197
You rang?

31:59.296 --> 32:01.096
Funny case you got here.

32:01.197 --> 32:03.031
Your victim
had an address.

32:03.130 --> 32:04.496
A home.
Paid rent,

32:04.663 --> 32:07.396
so we assume,
maybe even a mortgage.

32:07.494 --> 32:08.862
But not homeless,
in any case.

32:08.928 --> 32:13.296
No strangulation,
no red ribbon--

32:13.393 --> 32:15.995
Christopher partlow.

32:16.095 --> 32:17.929
A lesser man
might get pissy

32:18.028 --> 32:19.628
because you jumped the line,
bunk.

32:19.762 --> 32:21.663
me?

32:21.830 --> 32:25.230
I remember partlow's name
from all those cases last year.

32:25.361 --> 32:26.396
Congrats.

32:26.496 --> 32:28.298
Yeah.

32:28.396 --> 32:34.665
- But don't fuck with me
like this again.

32:34.763 --> 32:38.164
Yeah. Yeah.

32:38.298 --> 32:40.430
- He lied on his mortgage
application, huh?

32:40.530 --> 32:41.597
You know, we have a name
for that over here.

32:41.696 --> 32:42.863
- Yeah, the headshot.
I know.

32:42.963 --> 32:45.330
- On a mortgage charge,
he's certain to plead out.

32:45.497 --> 32:46.864
- Billy doesn't plead
his clients.

32:46.963 --> 32:48.597
- Then he's looking
at a lot of years.

32:48.696 --> 32:50.798
A federal jury
is a very different animal

32:50.866 --> 32:52.432
than what they see
on calvert street.

32:52.565 --> 32:53.799
- I tried
to tell them that--

32:53.864 --> 32:56.329
---Yeah, but mister bond
wanted to try is himself,

32:56.430 --> 33:00.232
see if he couldn't grandstand
his way to city hall.

33:00.332 --> 33:02.499
Well, you have the headshot,
detective.

33:02.598 --> 33:04.464
But no gun with which
to fire it.

33:04.596 --> 33:06.064
We can't take this case.

33:06.165 --> 33:07.331
It's all on paper.

33:07.431 --> 33:10.866
- You had canceled checks.
You had bank accounts.

33:10.965 --> 33:12.898
You had his bag man
on the stand.

33:12.997 --> 33:15.599
We had a city jury.

33:15.698 --> 33:18.065
- You know, we've been gathering
string on clay davis

33:18.165 --> 33:20.265
for six years,
detective.

33:20.431 --> 33:23.234
Six years, we've had a file open
on that shakedown artist.

33:23.331 --> 33:25.732
And now, after you
city sons of bitches

33:25.867 --> 33:30.601
have managed, in a single week,
to transform clay fucking davis

33:30.699 --> 33:34.701
into martin luther king, jr.,
you now come to me with this--

33:34.800 --> 33:37.267
Which you had in your
back pocket all along--

33:37.364 --> 33:39.667
Looking for the federal jury
of mostly white faces

33:39.799 --> 33:41.166
to remedy the problem?

33:41.266 --> 33:46.301
Well, I'm sorry.

33:50.535 --> 33:52.002
Thank you.

34:00.068 --> 34:01.002
What's this?

34:01.101 --> 34:04.303
- From the pocket
of a dead stick-up boy.

34:04.466 --> 34:05.700
Omar little.

34:05.799 --> 34:07.266
Omar? Dead?

34:07.365 --> 34:09.466
- You stop readin'
the twenty-fours?

34:09.567 --> 34:11.100
Killed yesterday
at a grocery.

34:11.201 --> 34:12.935
Slow to the draw,
he was.

34:13.034 --> 34:14.135
No shit.

34:14.234 --> 34:16.135
- One to the back
of the head.

34:16.235 --> 34:17.768
Norris and crutchfield
caught it.

34:17.870 --> 34:19.304
They're looking
for a juvenile.

34:19.402 --> 34:22.003
He was hunting
stanfield and crew.

34:22.101 --> 34:23.235
And this was on him?

34:23.303 --> 34:24.868
yep.

34:24.934 --> 34:26.768
Thought of you and lester
when I saw it.

34:26.868 --> 34:29.501
Payback for you
getting me back some great lab.

34:29.634 --> 34:32.304
Positive d.n.a.
On chris partlow.

34:32.402 --> 34:34.402
An alley beating, not one
of the ones in the vacants.

34:34.501 --> 34:36.101
Motherfucker.

34:36.204 --> 34:38.038
You have all kinds
of news today, don't you?

34:38.137 --> 34:39.670
- Yeah, going for a warrant
right now.

34:39.768 --> 34:43.101
- Hey, can you wait
to serve it?

34:43.202 --> 34:44.333
We're right at the edge,
bunk.

34:44.434 --> 34:45.801
How long?

34:45.936 --> 34:48.237
'cause this is an honest
fuckin' murder prosecution here.

34:48.335 --> 34:49.870
I'll talk to lester.

34:49.969 --> 34:51.871
Congrats.

34:52.036 --> 34:54.337
- Yeah.
No shuckin', no jivin'.

34:54.437 --> 34:55.337
Just good ol'
police work.

34:55.437 --> 34:56.337
How about that, jimmy?

34:56.436 --> 34:57.437
Hey, without my bullshit,

34:57.571 --> 35:00.804
you're still
waiting on lab work.

35:03.069 --> 35:05.771
- Listen, jimmy, the conaway
shooting from westport?

35:05.870 --> 35:07.137
The transvestite?

35:07.236 --> 35:08.669
I go to vicap, there's
another one just like it--

35:08.769 --> 35:12.070
Look--down in carolina,
four months ago.

35:12.205 --> 35:14.238
For a road car
and two nights in a hotel,

35:14.337 --> 35:15.771
I can put this down.

35:15.872 --> 35:16.872
- What are you
talking about?

35:17.004 --> 35:19.370
Yours is a 9 mm,
this one's a 32.

35:19.437 --> 35:21.739
Yours was a bar pick-up,
this one's a home invasion--

35:21.873 --> 35:25.273
- Still worth
checking out.

35:25.369 --> 35:27.271
- I don't see it.
Sorry.

35:27.368 --> 35:30.105
- You're gonna make me
spit it out, aren't you--

35:30.239 --> 35:32.439
You ever played
hilton head?

35:32.538 --> 35:34.538
I get a call from my
brother-in-law a few days ago.

35:34.637 --> 35:36.505
He managed to swing
a tee-time for this weekend.

35:36.605 --> 35:38.141
Jimmy,
i'm going, goddammit.

35:38.239 --> 35:41.141
The fuck do I care? Go.

35:41.240 --> 35:44.174
- You know, this is some real
cute shit you're pulling here.

35:44.273 --> 35:45.806
Taking the detail money

35:45.973 --> 35:48.707
and doling it around
ke a priest passing wafers.

35:48.807 --> 35:50.373
Now, I don't know
exactly what you're up to,

35:50.471 --> 35:53.307
but I know this: if someone
picked up a phone around here,

35:53.439 --> 35:57.941
your shit is
critically fucked.

35:58.007 --> 36:01.841
Two nights
and a road car.

36:14.108 --> 36:17.210
- Leander, I'm showing ten-fifty-five
and thirty-four from marlo's phone.

36:17.340 --> 36:18.740
Anybody on the move?

36:18.841 --> 36:21.440
- I got him coming eastbound
on baltimore street at calhoun.

36:21.575 --> 36:22.708
Who's on monk?

36:22.807 --> 36:25.408
Wait one.

36:25.507 --> 36:27.243
Twenty-three-oh-six
to twenty-three-eleven.

36:27.309 --> 36:28.311
Where you at, man?

36:28.407 --> 36:29.407
Twenty-three-eleven.

36:29.508 --> 36:31.942
Southbound m.l.k.
Approaching route forty.

36:32.043 --> 36:33.243
That's the meet, lester.

36:33.373 --> 36:34.775
Monk and marlo
on the westside.

36:34.875 --> 36:36.875
We on it.

36:52.375 --> 36:54.310
- Corner of argyle
and dolphin.

36:54.407 --> 36:56.209
Monk and marlo,
as expected.

36:56.309 --> 37:00.743
- Now I got four-forty and
thirty-five coming into marlo's phone.

37:00.875 --> 37:03.244
- Yeah, he's scoping
that, lester.

37:03.341 --> 37:05.576
- We know it ain't
monk callin'.

37:05.677 --> 37:07.245
- Twenty-three-oh-six
to twenty-three-twelve.

37:07.342 --> 37:08.244
Twenty-three twelve.

37:08.344 --> 37:09.312
Who do you have eyes on?

37:09.410 --> 37:10.343
Both my subjects.

37:10.443 --> 37:11.410
- They go to
their cell phones?

37:11.508 --> 37:12.409
Negative.

37:12.510 --> 37:14.077
They on the move?

37:14.143 --> 37:15.244
Negative.

37:15.342 --> 37:16.776
Twenty-three-fourteen.

37:16.877 --> 37:18.411
- We got nothing moving either.
- No one elscalling or moving.

37:18.511 --> 37:20.245
- Means we got somebody else
on this network

37:20.343 --> 37:24.146
we don't yet know.

37:24.245 --> 37:26.344
Oh, boy.

37:39.980 --> 37:41.446
- Hey, man.
Let me give you a hand.

37:41.544 --> 37:44.447
Alright, you ready?

37:44.545 --> 37:49.013
ah.

37:49.146 --> 37:50.979
- I don't have no money
in the moment,

37:51.079 --> 37:55.147
but I'll be going down
to the scales in a hour or two.

37:55.244 --> 38:01.812
You help me out,
i'll go ten for your trouble.

38:01.847 --> 38:08.379
You help me out,
i'll go ten for your trouble.

38:08.546 --> 38:11.647
Got a rag
for that behind you.

38:11.813 --> 38:14.814
Junk!
Junkman!

38:14.914 --> 38:17.014
Junk! Junk!

38:17.112 --> 38:19.579
Junkman! Junk!

38:26.581 --> 38:27.814
- Where the fuck
are you going?

38:27.914 --> 38:32.481
- Oh, uh, I gotta
see lester about--

38:32.581 --> 38:34.014
What's all that?

38:34.115 --> 38:37.015
- Parole info on known sex
offenders for five zip codes.

38:37.114 --> 38:38.882
I've also got background
info on my desk

38:38.948 --> 38:41.881
for everyone we picked up
at pier five with a cell phone.

38:42.015 --> 38:43.616
- You're actually gonna--
- Compare the f.b.i. Profile

38:43.783 --> 38:45.783
with every person of interest
I can find.

38:45.882 --> 38:49.217
Hell yeah,
somebody's gotta.

38:49.315 --> 38:50.380
- Come here.
- The fuck are you doin'?

38:50.481 --> 38:51.949
Come here.

38:57.581 --> 39:00.217
- Maurice dobey?
For governor?

39:00.317 --> 39:03.916
Of my state?
Sheet.

39:04.015 --> 39:05.416
That's some cynical politics,
right there.

39:05.482 --> 39:07.649
Playin' like you gonna
run a man you know can't win

39:07.749 --> 39:09.850
to scare people
into payin' off.

39:09.949 --> 39:11.349
- Dobey could
bloody you up, tommy.

39:11.449 --> 39:13.183
In baltimore
and p.g. Both.

39:13.249 --> 39:15.951
- Playin' that race card.
Shameful.

39:16.082 --> 39:17.717
- What does upshaw want
to stay out of the race?

39:17.818 --> 39:18.718
Tomuch.

39:18.818 --> 39:19.885
Are you going to pay?

39:19.984 --> 39:21.818
- Well, let's just say
i'm in negotiations.

39:21.884 --> 39:23.050
- Well, I'll do everything
I can to make sure

39:23.150 --> 39:25.250
this insurrection
doesn't spread into the city.

39:25.349 --> 39:27.784
- Wonderful! And how much
is the loyal support

39:27.884 --> 39:31.350
of the eastside democratic
coalition going to cost me?

39:31.516 --> 39:33.252
- Only an endorsement,
given that this man right here

39:33.350 --> 39:35.886
is still standing,
I don't believe that rupert bond

39:35.986 --> 39:37.419
is going to find his way
into this office.

39:37.518 --> 39:38.618
Do you?

39:38.718 --> 39:39.786
And for my endorsement,
you will return the favor

39:39.886 --> 39:42.254
and ignore our friends
in prince george's.

39:42.349 --> 39:43.250
And the loyalty
of the westside

39:43.384 --> 39:44.918
is going to cost me
what exactly?

39:45.017 --> 39:46.451
Oh, nothin' big.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.744
You got three seats comin' open
on the liquor board.

39:49.136 --> 39:49.941
You get one seat.

39:50.111 --> 39:52.786
Two, and you have me out there
raising money for you in the primary.

39:52.958 --> 39:55.249
Sold. And clay,
it scares me to think of the damage

39:55.417 --> 39:57.530
you could do with two votes on the liquor board.

40:02.547 --> 40:03.466
It ain't right.

40:04.204 --> 40:06.541
No... It just is.

40:06.710 --> 40:08.303
No, I mean, you can't do this.

40:08.473 --> 40:10.713
We're doing it. Whatever
they give us to work the bullshit,

40:10.882 --> 40:15.009
I throw it to lester. Or crutchfield,
or norris. Anyone else who has a case ***

40:15.178 --> 40:17.552
it was bad enough I wasted your day
yesterday going to quantico,

40:17.721 --> 40:19.500
I can't stand to see you wasting
any more time on this,

40:19.670 --> 40:21.275
you should be back working
your home invasion.

40:21.445 --> 40:23.685
- Jimmy, you can't do this.
- A couple days more.

40:23.853 --> 40:25.776
Lester gets his best shot at marlo,
after that

40:25.944 --> 40:28.162
we'll never hear
from the *** killer again.

40:28.333 --> 40:31.859
Bosses will lose interest,
i'll pretend to run out of little more string.

40:32.120 --> 40:34.852
And then it goes right back to the adman office.
No harm, no foul.

40:36.333 --> 40:38.084
Whatever you need, kima...

40:38.253 --> 40:40.852
To work your triple,
or any case that matters to you.

40:42.087 --> 40:45.374
Manpower, o.t., labwork, cars...

40:45.634 --> 40:47.668
Just let me know.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.255
I gotta go.

40:56.518 --> 40:58.355
Wake up!

41:05.245 --> 41:07.690
Hey, bug! Up here.

41:07.948 --> 41:09.934
Hold, boy.

41:11.036 --> 41:13.761
I'll get you that 10 tomorrow.
And if you're looking for work,

41:13.929 --> 41:15.488
I got work needs lifting.

41:15.658 --> 41:18.998
You know the stable on Booth Street?
Be there before 9.

41:21.258 --> 41:23.838
Dang, dukie ***

41:26.593 --> 41:29.755
i'm showing 5:15 and 34 seconds.

41:30.012 --> 41:32.857
I'm up park heights,
but I lost him just past the park.

41:32.989 --> 41:34.123
M.t.a. Bus
clipped a curb

41:34.190 --> 41:35.924
and it knocked down
a utility pole.

41:36.022 --> 41:37.723
By the time I detoured,
he slipped me good.

41:37.825 --> 41:42.692
Well, let me know.

41:42.790 --> 41:44.423
Big news.

41:44.522 --> 41:47.156
Bunk has a murder warrant
on chris partlow.

41:47.290 --> 41:48.491
The hell you say.

41:48.657 --> 41:49.858
- Not one
from the vacants.

41:49.957 --> 41:51.958
D.n.a. Match
on an alley beating.

41:52.056 --> 41:53.122
He lets this go now,

41:53.222 --> 41:54.690
these guys are gonna
go to ground.

41:54.791 --> 41:56.324
We're right at the edge
of something here.

41:56.424 --> 41:58.292
- He's giving us
a couple of days.

41:58.391 --> 41:59.325
He owes me.

41:59.424 --> 42:01.224
I expedited his lab work
for it.

42:01.323 --> 42:04.224
Oh, and omar little?
Stickup-boy?

42:04.391 --> 42:05.492
What about him?

42:05.592 --> 42:06.925
- Caught one in a korean joint
over westside.

42:07.058 --> 42:08.594
Bunk pulled that out
of his pocket.

42:08.692 --> 42:10.059
Mean anything
at all to us?

42:10.224 --> 42:12.826
- Look's like he was
after marlo's crew.

42:12.925 --> 42:18.360
Cheese.
Cheese wagstaff?

42:18.424 --> 42:20.358
In addition
to their corners,

42:20.491 --> 42:23.058
these guys are wholesaling
all over town at this point,

42:23.160 --> 42:24.961
so I figured cheese
was just one of many.

42:25.058 --> 42:29.260
- Note reads like omar
had him under marlo'wing.

42:29.360 --> 42:30.992
A lieutenant, at least.

42:31.128 --> 42:32.261
Anyway,
I gotta go,

42:32.361 --> 42:35.894
do more pretending
for the rest of the city.

42:35.958 --> 42:39.594
Oh, by the way,
i--I told greggs.

42:39.693 --> 42:41.326
- Oh, mcnulty.
How many more people--

42:41.427 --> 42:43.694
- She was about to jump into the
serial murders with both feet.

42:43.791 --> 42:45.525
I couldn't stand
to spin her like that--

42:45.625 --> 42:48.394
How'd she take it?

42:54.992 --> 42:56.661
- Twenty-three-oh-six to
any twenty-three sequence.

42:56.795 --> 42:57.928
Trying to reconnect
with my subject.

42:58.060 --> 42:59.627
- Anyone near northwest
who can assist?

42:59.728 --> 43:01.661
- Twenty-three-fifteen
to twenty-three-oh-six.

43:01.827 --> 43:03.360
I'm in the twenty-eight
hundred block

43:03.461 --> 43:05.995
edgecombe circle south,
sitting on the female subject.

43:06.095 --> 43:07.730
Maybe that's the other end
of your meet.

43:07.829 --> 43:08.729
Edgecombe circle?

43:08.829 --> 43:09.729
Where's that, twenty?

43:09.828 --> 43:11.995
It runs off pall mall.

43:12.161 --> 43:13.362
Where's pall mall?

43:13.461 --> 43:14.830
I'm not too good up
in the northwest.

43:14.894 --> 43:15.994
It's between pimlico--

43:16.161 --> 43:20.895
- Never mind,
I got a map book.

43:20.995 --> 43:24.297
Okay,
see what we got here.

43:24.396 --> 43:31.031
Map thirty-four,
grid e-three.

43:31.129 --> 43:37.564
Thirty-fr, e-three,
thirty-four, e-three--

43:37.661 --> 43:44.396
Three--

43:44.496 --> 43:45.496
Whaddya got?

43:45.629 --> 43:47.396
- Lester,
what'd that last clock show?

43:47.563 --> 43:49.930
- And these people that I
share the stage with tonight

43:50.030 --> 43:52.365
are here as representatives
of the hundreds,

43:52.463 --> 43:55.564
no, the thousands of citizens
without shelter,

43:55.663 --> 43:59.230
without protection,
in this city tonight.

43:59.329 --> 44:02.065
Why does this have to be?

44:02.165 --> 44:03.799
Certainly,
the last seven years

44:03.864 --> 44:06.699
have not brought the same levels
of federal commitment

44:06.797 --> 44:11.331
to american cities as from
previous administrations.

44:11.430 --> 44:14.498
And certaiy, our governor
has in the last year

44:14.596 --> 44:19.965
placed severe restrictions on whatever
stopgap state programs were in place.

44:20.065 --> 44:22.700
And what little remained
of our so-called safety net

44:22.767 --> 44:24.233
was simply shredded,

44:24.366 --> 44:26.699
and more and more
of our fellow citizens

44:26.865 --> 44:29.265
found themselves living life
at the broken edges,

44:29.365 --> 44:30.965
in the street.

44:31.063 --> 44:33.064
Well, I say that this is
not on tragic,

44:33.164 --> 44:34.897
it is unforgivable!

44:36.264 --> 44:38.165
And I am here to say
that no longer can these people

44:38.264 --> 44:40.999
with whom I share this stage
tonight be invisible,

44:41.165 --> 44:45.700
just, just, just as all of those
without shelter in this city,

44:45.800 --> 44:48.965
in this country, can
no longer be invisible to us.

44:49.065 --> 44:51.332
And it is regrettable
that it has taken the actions

44:51.433 --> 44:53.702
of a remorseless predator
to make us reflect.

44:53.800 --> 44:55.966
But we in baltimore
have been tested,

44:56.065 --> 44:59.067
and we have been taught
that all of our citizens

44:59.234 --> 45:01.701
deserve the full protection
of the law,

45:01.801 --> 45:05.168
and the full support
of the community.

45:05.300 --> 45:07.300
And we are saying
to this senseless killer,

45:07.366 --> 45:10.065
and to all the other ills
that prey on those

45:10.201 --> 45:13.000
without shelter
in our city--

45:13.100 --> 45:14.735
Not tonight
can you prey on them.

45:14.835 --> 45:19.936
And not tomorrow.
Not any longer.

45:20.069 --> 45:23.103
We will protect you!

45:23.202 --> 45:25.001
Thank you.

46:04.038 --> 46:07.672
- She asked you keep
that one stirred.

46:07.769 --> 46:12.137
- Hey, you were
on my thing, right?

46:12.304 --> 46:14.437
I guess I owe you
a drink on that.

46:14.603 --> 46:15.605
What's your poison?

46:15.705 --> 46:18.939
- I'm okay, senator,
thank you very much.

46:19.038 --> 46:20.305
Obonda, huh?

46:20.439 --> 46:22.773
That's a good one.

46:22.938 --> 46:25.706
You know, that was mostly my
evidence you beat back there, right?

46:25.805 --> 46:27.840
You think you
could do that again?

46:27.937 --> 46:29.237
Excuse me?

46:29.337 --> 46:32.205
- 'Cept this time,
the jury's a federal one.

46:32.303 --> 46:35.306
Say, nine white,
three black.

46:35.404 --> 46:39.505
- Time for you
to tip on out, detective.

46:42.071 --> 46:43.905
- Bank records
on that mortgage application

46:44.005 --> 46:46.905
you made on the calvert county
property years back.

46:47.004 --> 46:50.140
Now, why don't you
take that back to billy murphy?

46:50.240 --> 46:52.607
Ask your attorney
what you're exposed to.

46:52.704 --> 46:58.339
At this point, this is just between
us two gentlemen here, senator.

46:58.439 --> 47:01.373
And no one else
till I make it so.

47:01.506 --> 47:02.439
What?

47:02.538 --> 47:04.338
You tryin' to sell
a case back to me?

47:04.440 --> 47:06.072
Motherfucker,
if you don't get--

47:06.172 --> 47:07.440
- I don't get paid
like that.

47:07.539 --> 47:09.140
I get paid when
I come bacup in here

47:09.273 --> 47:10.774
a couple nights time
with questions.

47:10.873 --> 47:12.074
And you, sir,
have answers.

47:12.174 --> 47:13.975
Or my next call will be
to the u.s. Attorney's office,

47:14.108 --> 47:16.375
and we will go again.

47:16.474 --> 47:17.741
But for real.

47:17.840 --> 47:25.576
You can keep tt copy.
Ma'am.

47:25.608 --> 47:33.309
You can keep that copy.
Ma'am.

47:33.441 --> 47:35.742
- Just to let you know,
before the fireworks start,

47:35.840 --> 47:37.640
i'm spiking this lede
and I'll play it straight.

47:37.741 --> 47:38.707
But you got back?

47:38.841 --> 47:41.843
As best I can.

47:41.907 --> 47:43.576
Scott!

47:56.508 --> 48:00.110
I'm spiking your lede.

48:00.209 --> 48:03.409
I'm not running a story
about a public gathering--

48:03.508 --> 48:05.742
A candlelight vigil
at city hall, in fact--

48:05.843 --> 48:09.643
Where the lede anecdote and quote
is from an unnamed homeless woman.

48:09.745 --> 48:11.311
- She doesn't want to be
known as homeless.

48:11.410 --> 48:12.844
I explained that.

48:12.944 --> 48:15.945
- Scott, there were hundreds of
homeless down there tonight--

48:16.045 --> 48:18.780
People who voluntarily
attended this event.

48:18.845 --> 48:20.577
And I'm gonna guess
that any number of them

48:20.742 --> 48:22.576
would've let you put
their names in the paper.

48:22.677 --> 48:25.177
- But her story is great.
Look at that quote--

48:25.308 --> 48:26.309
It's a perfect quote.

48:26.443 --> 48:27.810
Best quote
I could ever ask for.

48:32.511 --> 48:34.244
Jesus christ.

48:34.343 --> 48:37.844
To hell with you
if you think I made it up.

48:37.944 --> 48:41.511
- We have a standard
that we follow here.

48:41.678 --> 48:43.878
And I'm gonna follow it.

49:09.713 --> 49:12.514
Here it comes, gus.

49:12.613 --> 49:14.912
yep.

49:21.344 --> 49:24.612
- Gus, you're retopping
scott's vigil copy?

49:24.712 --> 49:25.913
I am.

49:26.046 --> 49:27.180
But I thought--

49:27.279 --> 49:29.646
- Anonymous attribution
in a public setting.

49:29.747 --> 49:31.113
There's no need for it.

49:31.278 --> 49:32.313
Gus, let's discuss this.

49:32.481 --> 49:33.480
- Actually,
I did discuss it.

49:33.582 --> 49:35.080
I discussed it
with the metro editor,

49:35.180 --> 49:36.080
and he agrees.

49:36.213 --> 49:38.214
Now, the story's
on the copy desk,

49:38.281 --> 49:39.849
and as a line editor
working this story,

49:39.946 --> 49:41.647
I feel I've done my job.

49:41.748 --> 49:45.948
Now, you as the m.e.,
if you want to go another way,

49:46.081 --> 49:47.582
you pull the story back
and re-edit.

49:47.715 --> 49:49.482
But we have a sourcing
policy here,

49:49.581 --> 49:51.280
and I knowt,
and I do not feel comfortable

49:51.381 --> 49:53.181
bending the rules
in this instance.

49:53.280 --> 49:54.849
G'night.

50:14.049 --> 50:15.516
Yeah?

50:15.582 --> 50:17.049
- Mcnulty,
it's christeson.

50:17.216 --> 50:18.782
Listen,
my case is down an'

50:18.914 --> 50:19.849
I wanted
to thank you.

50:20.014 --> 50:21.582
I couldn't have done it
otherwise.

50:21.683 --> 50:24.016
No problem.

50:36.417 --> 50:38.718
Hey. It went great.

50:38.785 --> 50:39.717
Kids asleep?

50:39.815 --> 50:41.684
- Yeah, but they saw you
on w.b.a.l.

50:41.784 --> 50:43.350
Anna said your hair
looked funny.

50:43.450 --> 50:45.618
- Well, just so long as
she was impressed.

50:45.718 --> 50:47.152
Cnn was there.

50:47.249 --> 50:49.784
I wonder if they'll cycle
any coverage through tonight.

50:49.882 --> 50:51.584
- A good day
for hizzoner, huh?

50:51.684 --> 50:52.851
I dunno.

50:52.950 --> 50:54.417
Nerese shook me down
for a mayoral endorsement,

50:54.517 --> 50:56.685
and clay davis,
back from the grave,

50:56.784 --> 50:58.617
took a couple
liquor board seats.

50:58.717 --> 51:01.151
Just so as they won't join
in upshaw's little warparty

51:01.253 --> 51:03.220
down in prince george's.

51:03.320 --> 51:04.420
- You're gonna endorse
nerese?

51:04.520 --> 51:06.153
You told me
you prefer bond.

51:06.252 --> 51:09.286
- I do,
but this thing with upshaw--

51:09.385 --> 51:11.152
Shit, I might even
have to give him a bump

51:11.252 --> 51:12.552
just to calm him down.

51:12.650 --> 51:14.184
- God.
What's he asking?

51:14.284 --> 51:16.084
There--look.

51:16.183 --> 51:17.983
What's upshaw asking?

51:18.082 --> 51:21.252
- Half of any extra school
or anti-crime money

51:21.352 --> 51:22.820
I get outta the legislature
for baltimore

51:22.917 --> 51:24.352
would go to p.g. County.

51:24.519 --> 51:26.285
- You take that deal
and baltimore's out

51:26.418 --> 51:28.652
half of what you want to bring
back to the city schools.

51:28.787 --> 51:32.920
- Yeah, but if I don't win, jen,
I bring back exactly nothing.

51:33.052 --> 51:34.820
Look.

51:34.917 --> 51:36.919
- And we are saying
to this senseless killer,

51:36.986 --> 51:40.154
and to all the other ills--

51:49.387 --> 51:50.954
- Go on.
Straight to bed.

51:51.086 --> 51:51.953
Hey, kiddo.

51:52.118 --> 51:55.653
Hey, mcnulty.

51:55.755 --> 51:58.223
Where'd you go to?

51:58.287 --> 52:00.287
- None of your business
really, jimmy.

52:00.388 --> 52:02.020
Next time,
i'm not going anywhere.

52:02.187 --> 52:03.488
Next time, you're gonna
be out on your ass,

52:03.589 --> 52:07.288
because that's
my fucking house.

52:13.220 --> 52:15.120
That's police work, son.

52:15.187 --> 52:17.222
- I pull the a.d.c. Book
to find a location,

52:17.321 --> 52:20.588
and I'm on the same page number
as the second hand.

52:20.689 --> 52:21.955
And I remember
wead a lotta clocks

52:22.055 --> 52:23.288
with thirty-four seconds.

52:23.388 --> 52:24.954
- That's a page
from west baltimore.

52:25.054 --> 52:26.222
Right.

52:26.321 --> 52:28.757
Now, the second hand
is always the map page.

52:28.857 --> 52:31.791
Longitude, a-through-k,
is the hour,

52:31.922 --> 52:35.692
and for the latitude, they go
by five-minute intervals.

52:35.790 --> 52:37.689
Now they know
the meeting spot in advance,

52:37.789 --> 52:40.322
and they code it
by the grid square.

52:40.423 --> 52:43.157
But if the clock
has nothing to do with time,

52:43.288 --> 52:46.557
how do they know
when to meet?

52:50.590 --> 52:53.524
- Everything's less than
a half hour of driving,

52:53.625 --> 52:57.926
even in traffic.

52:58.057 --> 52:59.990
My guess is
that the standing logic

53:00.090 --> 53:04.225
is that they meet
within an hour or so.

53:08.790 --> 53:12.056
You know what else
makes sense?

53:12.156 --> 53:17.526
This clock face when no one
was on the move?

53:17.624 --> 53:20.424
The times are all
at thirty-five seconds.

53:20.523 --> 53:24.289
And that's the page
for east bawlmer.

53:24.392 --> 53:25.924
Cheese.

53:26.024 --> 53:27.792
Cheese wagstaff?

53:33.092 --> 53:35.460
- Marlo's wholesaling
on the westside through monk,

53:35.558 --> 53:36.459
and on the eastside
with cheese.

53:36.560 --> 53:38.294
He's got the whole
goddamn city.

53:38.426 --> 53:41.727
- How do we know
it's cheese?

53:41.825 --> 53:43.658
oh--

53:48.558 --> 53:51.994
You, too, huh?

53:52.094 --> 53:53.729
You all
are good with this?

53:53.894 --> 53:55.294
Kima--

53:55.427 --> 53:57.027
Not me.

54:01.826 --> 54:03.394
All the guysat the bar, jimmy?

54:03.494 --> 54:05.127
All the girls?

54:05.225 --> 54:07.826
They don't show up
at your wake.

54:07.925 --> 54:09.660
Not because
they don't like you

54:09.759 --> 54:13.128
but because they never
knew your last name.

54:13.227 --> 54:15.660
A month later, someone tells 'em
"oh, jimmy died."

54:15.761 --> 54:17.093
"jimmy who?"

54:17.193 --> 54:18.227
"jimmy the cop."

54:18.360 --> 54:22.495
"ohh," they say.
"him."

54:22.659 --> 54:24.761
And all the people
on the job,

54:24.862 --> 54:27.763
all the people you spent all
those hours in the radio car with,

54:27.861 --> 54:30.662
the guys with their feet up
on their desk telling stories,

54:30.761 --> 54:32.428
who shorted you
on the food runs,

54:32.529 --> 54:35.029
who signed your
overtime slips.

54:35.129 --> 54:39.062
In the end, they're not
gonna be there either.

54:39.161 --> 54:40.528
Family.
That's it.

54:40.661 --> 54:41.597
Family.

54:41.697 --> 54:43.296
And if you're lucky,

54:43.396 --> 54:46.864
one or two friends
who are the same as family.

54:46.963 --> 54:48.964
That's all
the best of us get.

54:49.063 --> 54:52.064
Everything else is just--

54:59.664 --> 55:03.965
- There is no
serial killer.

55:04.063 --> 55:07.731
There are no murders.
I made it all up.

55:12.629 --> 55:13.729
They were--they were
shutting us down.

55:13.863 --> 55:15.896
They were--
They were just--

55:15.997 --> 55:17.097
It's hard to explain.

55:17.231 --> 55:19.065
I don't even know
where the anger comes from.

55:19.163 --> 55:21.798
I don't know
how to make it stop.

55:21.964 --> 55:29.233
They fucking task me,
they do.

55:29.364 --> 55:31.599
We took the money from
the bullshit investigation,

55:31.699 --> 55:33.431
and we routed it
to lester.

55:33.531 --> 55:38.198
Now he's got the cake
to take down marlo stanfield.

55:38.296 --> 55:40.664
And now
that I've done all this--

55:40.731 --> 55:41.664
Now that I've
watched myself do it,

55:41.730 --> 55:47.732
I can't even stand to--

55:47.832 --> 55:49.932
Lester says he's close.

55:49.998 --> 55:50.998
Time will pass,

55:51.098 --> 55:55.366
and I'll be able
to shut this thing down.

55:55.466 --> 55:58.733
If you don't go to jail.

56:02.998 --> 56:05.368
You had no fucking right.

56:05.465 --> 56:11.567
- I know.
- This is my life, too.

56:11.666 --> 56:13.500
You start to tell the story;
you think you're the hero.

56:13.600 --> 56:27.471
And then, when you get done
talking, you--
