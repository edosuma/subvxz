00:01.595 --> 00:05.555
Tonight: a man-sized blast
from the past.

00:05.555 --> 00:09.135
RenauIt's V6 rocket in your pocket.

00:09.135 --> 00:14.004
And which takes longer to change -
a gearbox or a woman's outfit?

00:16.855 --> 00:21.415
Hello. The show tonight
is about blokeishness -

00:21.415 --> 00:25.495
we won't ask directions
or read instructions.

00:25.495 --> 00:30.405
We have a sound recordist who came
to a shoot with his car stoved in.

00:30.405 --> 00:35.215
He'd been on the M6 in a queue
of slow moving traffic, bored.

00:35.215 --> 00:40.595
He wondered if it would be possible
to drive with your legs crossed.

00:40.595 --> 00:44.205
No woman would ever do that!

00:44.205 --> 00:49.565
The same with under and oversteer.
A girl doesn't ask the difference.

00:49.565 --> 00:53.675
But we've had letters
from blokes asking.

00:53.675 --> 00:57.625
Over to Richard's science corner.

00:57.625 --> 01:00.915
It's simple. Understeer is this.

01:00.915 --> 01:06.425
You drive, turn the wheel, the car
goes on, crashes into a tree -
you die.

01:06.425 --> 01:09.415
Oversteer works like this.

01:09.415 --> 01:16.155
You drive, turn the wheel,
the back comes round like this,
you crash into a tree, and die.

01:16.155 --> 01:21.125
Oversteer is best, cos you don't
see the tree that kills you.

01:21.125 --> 01:23.755
I understand that.

01:23.755 --> 01:29.675
Front-wheel drive cars understeer,
real-wheel drive cars oversteer.

01:29.675 --> 01:35.695
But with one car, you never knew
what it would do. The Porsche 911.

01:35.695 --> 01:41.825
Unlike a Ferrari, the engine's
not in the middle, but in the back.

01:41.825 --> 01:44.635
It upsets the balance.

01:44.635 --> 01:47.985
It's like a horse pushing a cart.

01:47.985 --> 01:55.005
It's called a 911 so the Americans
would know what to dial
when they crashed.

01:55.005 --> 01:58.635
They would crash - it's a scary car.

01:58.635 --> 02:01.866
The scariest model is the Turbo.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:10.445 --> 02:16.925
A woman would have moved the engine,
but as Porsche's run by men,
they've spent the last 40 years

02:16.925 --> 02:20.425
trying to work their way round it.

02:20.425 --> 02:24.845
They've done it.
The Turbo has four-wheel drive,

02:24.845 --> 02:28.505
and the best chassis of any car.

02:28.505 --> 02:35.065
The engine is at the back,
pressing down like a big lump
on the rear wheels,

02:35.065 --> 02:37.865
so you get tons of grip,

02:37.865 --> 02:41.369
and tons and tons of traction.

02:43.045 --> 02:47.982
MUSIC: "Hate To Say I Told You So"
by The Hives

02:53.165 --> 02:57.165
I said a couple of years ago

02:57.165 --> 03:01.285
that this car's better
than a Ferrari 355.

03:01.285 --> 03:03.645
It's wonderful.

03:03.645 --> 03:07.005
Amazing car. It's sorted. What?

03:07.005 --> 03:12.485
That's not the end.
We've seen enough. I'm confident...

03:12.485 --> 03:16.955
Who'd like to see what happens?
ALL: Yes! Roll it.

03:16.955 --> 03:19.085
TYRES SCREECH

03:19.085 --> 03:23.775
LAUGHTER
You spun it, then.

03:23.775 --> 03:26.645
Slightly. Slightly?

03:26.645 --> 03:30.075
"I slightly fell off a ladder. "

03:30.075 --> 03:34.985
When you're driving a Ferrari
or a Lamborghini, they say,

03:34.985 --> 03:39.425
"I'll kill you,
I'll turn the knife round. "

03:39.425 --> 03:45.735
With the 911 Turbo, it lulls you
into a false sense of security.

03:45.735 --> 03:50.955
It's a circus lion - "It jumps
through hoops, it's docile. "

03:50.955 --> 03:56.125
It's still a lion!
It's still a 420bhp supercar!

03:56.125 --> 04:01.184
You've got to be superhuman
to get the best out of it. I'm not.

04:01.184 --> 04:04.517
Luckily, I know a man who is.

04:05.834 --> 04:12.182
Off the line,
and the Porsche spins its wheels -
it really is wet out there.

04:16.543 --> 04:21.334
Will the Hammerhead
defeat the Porsche's huge grip?

04:21.334 --> 04:25.694
Yes - he's sideways.
The rain's doing it no favours.

04:25.694 --> 04:28.914
Ooh! Squirming under braking there.

04:28.914 --> 04:34.694
He's already five seconds down
on the Zonda's time.

04:34.694 --> 04:38.494
He'll struggle to make that up.

04:43.134 --> 04:47.034
Into the follow-through,
a dab of brakes...

04:47.034 --> 04:52.144
He's now where the Zonda lapped him
1.23 in the last series.

04:52.144 --> 04:56.894
He won't match it in this weather.
Across the line in...

04:56.894 --> 04:59.384
One minute 31.

04:59.384 --> 05:02.394
Where does that go?

05:02.394 --> 05:05.034
Here. There, above the M3.

05:05.034 --> 05:09.954
If you take four seconds off,
to give a dry time, that's 1 min 27.

05:09.954 --> 05:14.974
Faster than the Murcielago. Great,
if you know what you're doing.

05:14.974 --> 05:19.559
And now there's a version
for those who don't.

05:24.494 --> 05:27.514
This is the diet 911 Turbo.

05:27.514 --> 05:32.895
It's the one cal, low fat version
they call the C4S.

05:39.334 --> 05:44.554
It looks the same as a Turbo -
flared wheel arches and spoilers.

05:44.554 --> 05:50.459
It has the same chassis, four-wheel
drive, brakes and sports suspension.

05:52.974 --> 05:58.914
It even has the same flat six
3. 6-litre engine as the Turbo.

05:58.914 --> 06:02.924
Except...there's no turbo.

06:02.924 --> 06:07.794
ENGINE ROARS
This, then, is an ordinary 911.

06:07.794 --> 06:12.424
A plain and simple Carrera 4,
in a He-Man suit.

06:21.254 --> 06:23.964
You know what this is?

06:23.964 --> 06:27.914
It's the Porsche neo-Georgian house.

06:27.914 --> 06:32.814
All the looks, but without
the 18th century killer plumbing.

06:32.814 --> 06:37.672
It's fine. If you like
that sort of thing.

06:43.924 --> 06:46.944
Ha ha! It's interesting.

06:46.944 --> 06:52.924
The engine sounds at its best
when you go 14mph. Town speed.

06:52.924 --> 06:56.554
Posing speed. People are looking.

06:56.554 --> 07:01.560
Out in the countryside, you build
up speed, and it settles down.

07:05.584 --> 07:10.274
By losing the turbo, the brake
horsepower falls from 420 to 320.

07:10.274 --> 07:12.924
320's still a lot.

07:12.924 --> 07:18.744
So it's still a fast car -
0-60 in 5.1 seconds.

07:18.744 --> 07:23.067
A top speed of 174.

07:29.824 --> 07:35.784
It's not scary fast. It's not like
going to the pub with a murderer.

07:35.784 --> 07:40.335
You're not thinking, "This is fun,
but soon I will be dead. "

07:44.464 --> 07:47.404
There's another advantage.

07:47.404 --> 07:52.064
The Turbo costs £88,000.
This is £63,000.

07:52.064 --> 07:56.684
That's a saving of £25,000.

07:56.684 --> 07:59.204
But...

07:59.204 --> 08:05.504
I don't know. I mean, yes,
it's a wonderful car, no doubt,
and it's a Porsche.

08:05.504 --> 08:11.064
Do 100,000 miles and it won't go
wrong, even in snow or drizzle.

08:11.064 --> 08:14.524
I respect its abilities.

08:14.524 --> 08:20.244
But if you can have those abilities
in a Carrera 4 for £60,000,

08:20.244 --> 08:23.793
why pay more for a fake?

08:30.133 --> 08:34.863
Earlier, we launched a search
for Britain's biggest car bore.

08:34.863 --> 08:37.773
We got some letters which were good.

08:37.773 --> 08:41.523
One of them was simply outstanding.

08:41.523 --> 08:44.493
This is Robert Lim.

08:44.493 --> 08:47.563
This is his Sierra, and his house.

08:47.563 --> 08:50.339
Standard stuff.

08:51.413 --> 08:57.663
There's a living room, kitchen,
the usual stuff. Cupboards.

08:57.663 --> 09:00.663
Bread bin. That's odd.

09:00.663 --> 09:05.942
Microwave. Car. As you do.

09:07.503 --> 09:10.823
MUSIC: "Neighbourhood" by Space

09:10.823 --> 09:15.863
Robert, I've got to ask.
Why is it in the kitchen?

09:15.863 --> 09:21.023
I designed it there. I sketched it
out on cardboard on the floor.

09:21.023 --> 09:26.433
Metal was laid on that. A few bits
got welded. One thing led to another.

09:26.433 --> 09:32.363
What is it?
sprints, hill climbs
and speed records.

09:32.363 --> 09:36.583
It's serious kit. Yeah.
Not a kit car. No.

09:36.583 --> 09:40.563
Does it work? Shall I show you?
Go on.

09:40.563 --> 09:45.943
There's a degree of fire hazard.
I have a fire extinguisher.

09:45.943 --> 09:49.363
Take the safety wedge out.

09:49.363 --> 09:54.923
Right. OK. Yeah,
that's just squeezing through.

09:54.923 --> 09:57.563
You blow it through? Yep.

09:57.563 --> 10:02.125
I'll hold the...
I'll stand over here.

10:04.083 --> 10:09.453
How often do you fire it up?
Not that often.

10:09.453 --> 10:15.103
Because of the potential for
something peculiar. Peculiar? Right.

10:15.103 --> 10:18.843
But I've got the safety wedge out.

10:18.843 --> 10:23.573
If it catches fire,
spray it at the carburettor.

10:23.573 --> 10:28.023
That's full of water, too.
A kettle. Yeah.

10:28.023 --> 10:31.925
ENGINE STARTS AND ROARS

10:37.173 --> 10:42.023
That's fantastic! It blew a piece
of the skirting board off!

10:42.023 --> 10:45.733
The exhaust blew it off the wall.

10:45.733 --> 10:48.243
It's running rich.

10:48.243 --> 10:52.893
Close to your fire. I turned
the gas off at the mains. Good.

10:52.893 --> 10:57.103
♪ Beautiful neighbourhood... ♪

10:57.103 --> 11:02.283
It doesn't end there. This is
a kitchen. This is a kitchen door.

11:02.283 --> 11:06.933
This is a car. Kitchen door - car.

11:06.933 --> 11:12.373
You can see where this is going,
can't you?

11:12.373 --> 11:18.778
It won't go out of the kitchen door.
Is he going to take the car apart?
No.

11:38.073 --> 11:40.993
That was perfect!

11:40.993 --> 11:43.673
Did you know it wouldn't come out?

11:43.673 --> 11:48.193
When you're past a certain stage,
you get a momentum.

11:48.193 --> 11:50.893
There's always distractions.

11:50.893 --> 11:55.493
You work in the back as a hobby,
to take your mind off work.

11:55.493 --> 12:02.013
You just...after a few years
of doing it... Like a jigsaw puzzle.
Yeah. But bigger.

12:02.013 --> 12:06.803
What was it like working there?
Good working conditions. Ideal.

12:06.803 --> 12:10.398
Warm and dry, the house. Brilliant.

12:20.353 --> 12:23.213
Could someone stand on the ramp?

12:23.213 --> 12:27.053
Is there any danger? Er... no.

12:27.053 --> 12:31.001
Excellent. Is there any danger?
LAUGHTER

12:35.193 --> 12:37.833
'And so there it is.

12:37.833 --> 12:41.853
'Free at last,
and ready to go racing. '

12:41.853 --> 12:46.393
So did he know the car
would never come out of the kitchen?

12:46.393 --> 12:51.133
No, not when he started.
He got partway through,

12:51.133 --> 12:56.203
and then he realised it wasn't
going to go out, but he carried on.

12:56.203 --> 13:00.913
It was a warm place to work,
and he liked it. No wife involved?

13:00.913 --> 13:06.113
There was, but unlike the car,
the wife did fit through the door!

13:06.113 --> 13:08.133
LAUGHTER

13:08.133 --> 13:13.013
This programme is mostly about
blokes, but our guest isn't one.

13:13.013 --> 13:17.943
She's Britain's second richest
ginger-haired Liverpudlian woman.

13:17.943 --> 13:20.473
Ladies and gentlemen, Anne Robinson!

13:20.473 --> 13:22.475
CHEERING

13:26.413 --> 13:29.133
Hi Anne, how are you?

13:29.133 --> 13:31.693
Are you well? Have a seat. I will.

13:33.413 --> 13:39.143
I hope the person who worked out
my wealth didn't do the lap timings.

13:39.143 --> 13:42.113
Why? Are you claiming that Cilla...

13:42.113 --> 13:47.393
I'm just saying I hope the person
who worked out that I was second...

13:47.393 --> 13:49.913
Well, she has just bought a Ferrari.

13:49.913 --> 13:55.153
Mind you, it wouldn't go with her
hair. Orange hair with a red car.

13:55.153 --> 13:58.113
I'd never buy a red car. Not you!

13:58.113 --> 14:02.914
Don't you think anyone who's ever
owned a red Ferrari is a plonker?

14:04.253 --> 14:09.013
Do you know, I don't, actually.
You wouldn't dream of it, would you?

14:09.013 --> 14:11.753
I wouldn't dream of it! No.

14:11.753 --> 14:16.753
Now, if you're so rich
as you claim to be,

14:16.753 --> 14:19.623
why do you have such a crummy car?

14:19.623 --> 14:24.753
Do I have a crummy car?
You have a Mercedes SL500.

14:24.753 --> 14:29.723
No, no. Jeremy, I'm sorry, but that
is Penrose's car. Your husband's.

14:29.723 --> 14:35.525
Yes. Yeah. And you're going to get
into one of these conversations

14:35.763 --> 14:38.473
cos you've got... The superior model.

14:38.473 --> 14:43.643
So what you're saying is, our car
has a smaller penis than your car.

14:43.643 --> 14:45.953
LAUGHTER
Yeah.

14:45.953 --> 14:50.043
Tell me this...
APPLAUSE

14:50.043 --> 14:52.068
Yeah?

14:54.033 --> 14:59.283
Don't you find the really joyful
thing about both the cars

14:59.283 --> 15:05.563
is...you know when
you're stuck in a traffic jam? Mmm.
Isn't it fun to watch telly?

15:05.563 --> 15:11.483
I haven't had the television put in.
Oh, you don't have a television! No.

15:11.483 --> 15:17.023
But mine's so fast, I can get home
in time to watch the programme.

15:17.023 --> 15:20.703
You bought the wrong car. Sorry.

15:20.703 --> 15:24.823
I didn't buy it. Well,
your husband... is he here? Yes.

15:24.823 --> 15:28.003
Where is he? Penrose!
LAUGHTER

15:28.003 --> 15:32.483
There he is at the back.
You bought the wrong car!

15:32.483 --> 15:37.223
What do you think of blokes who go
on about cars? I can't understand.

15:37.223 --> 15:43.283
It's like women discussing
nail polish. It doesn't matter.
You just get in a car and drive it!

15:43.283 --> 15:48.483
That's all there is to be said.
You watch TV in your car. Yeah.

15:48.483 --> 15:51.003
We've got these books here.

15:51.003 --> 15:57.663
Road Vehicle Aerodynamic Design,
by RH Barnard. I presume
that's not Rebecca Barnard, is it?

15:57.663 --> 16:02.583
This is another one from my library.
This is my favourite book.

16:02.583 --> 16:06.503
How To Rebuild
Big-Block Chevy Engines.

16:06.503 --> 16:11.673
This isn't what you'd have in your
house. No. Penrose has to cover

16:11.673 --> 16:17.623
what I call Penrose porn, which is
the car magazines. "Penrose porn"!

16:17.623 --> 16:22.023
If he brought home
Big-Block Chevy Engines,

16:22.023 --> 16:25.073
I'd have to readjust his medication!

16:25.073 --> 16:29.423
What, his Chateauneuf-du-Pape? Yes.

16:29.423 --> 16:32.133
Let's test out your bloke-iness. OK.

16:32.133 --> 16:38.083
Do you ever ask for directions?
We've got sat nav now. But I would.

16:38.083 --> 16:43.623
Any men here today? A few. Has any
man here ever asked for directions?

16:43.623 --> 16:48.363
That's a silly question. Never.
Why do you think we don't?

16:48.363 --> 16:52.553
I think you can't bear
to let us think...

16:52.553 --> 16:57.283
What Penrose does is keep pretending
he knows where we're going. Mmm.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.813
That's what it is. Yeah.

16:59.813 --> 17:05.463
And if you've got the map on your
knee, and you tell him where to go,

17:05.463 --> 17:11.123
he makes a decision without seeing
the map! Just out of nowhere.

17:11.123 --> 17:16.633
And it gets worse. We've now
got sat nav in most of our cars.

17:16.633 --> 17:19.063
And...
LAUGHTER

17:19.063 --> 17:23.473
Was that a silly thing to say?
"In most of our cars"!

17:23.473 --> 17:28.233
You know we call her Audrey Hepburn?
Who? Oh, the woman... The sat nav.

17:28.233 --> 17:32.983
We were in Dijon last week,
and we'd never been to Dijon before,

17:32.983 --> 17:37.673
so Penrose can't possibly
know anything about Dijon!

17:37.673 --> 17:40.183
We get to a roundabout,

17:40.183 --> 17:44.733
and she says, "Take
the second turning on the left. "

17:44.733 --> 17:47.943
And he says, "It's the first one. "

17:47.943 --> 17:50.452
LAUGHTER

17:50.452 --> 17:56.372
You do read about the difference
between men and women on the road.

17:56.372 --> 18:01.583
Apparently, men are distracted by
girls on pavements 42 times a week.

18:02.892 --> 18:06.132
Girls are only distracted 17 times.

18:06.132 --> 18:11.252
They haven't counted the number
of times girls look at shoe shops!

18:11.252 --> 18:17.172
28% of men say they've had sex
in a car, but only 20% of women do.

18:17.172 --> 18:22.132
Men think a car is four times
more important than women do

18:22.132 --> 18:27.412
for pulling, attracting a member
of the opposite sex. Do you agree?

18:27.412 --> 18:33.012
No. No, because actually,
what guys never get the hang of...

18:33.012 --> 18:38.532
I mean, what guys should do if they
want to pull is go out with a guy

18:38.532 --> 18:43.292
who is very talkative, very showy,
very flash, and say nothing.

18:43.292 --> 18:48.052
That's how to pull a girl. That
explains everything for my friends.

18:48.052 --> 18:50.782
So actually,

18:50.782 --> 18:54.572
the car should be very understated.

18:54.572 --> 18:59.452
Really? Yeah. Dirty, understated,
preferably with a dog in the back.

18:59.452 --> 19:03.132
That's an attractive proposition?
Very attractive.

19:03.132 --> 19:08.092
Tell us what you think of these
cars. Is this an attractive sight?

19:08.092 --> 19:13.492
Good-looking guy... That's a guy
without a girlfriend, isn't it?

19:13.492 --> 19:19.822
Yes. I'd agree with you. So you're
not a fan of that sort of thing? No.

19:19.822 --> 19:23.172
Not if they're over 18.
LAUGHTER

19:23.172 --> 19:26.742
That won't do, chaps.
Let's see the next.

19:26.742 --> 19:32.052
I quite like that. That's
an Audi 4 Quattro Coupe, isn't it?

19:32.052 --> 19:35.492
TT. Well, don't be picky with me!

19:35.492 --> 19:40.742
I do actually quite like that.
I think that's quite cool.

19:40.742 --> 19:45.692
It's not cool on our cool wall.
But I know what I'm talking about.

19:45.692 --> 19:48.022
LAUGHTER

19:48.022 --> 19:51.052
I'll be sure to move it later on.

19:51.052 --> 19:56.182
Next. Now, that's a Mazda MX5.
It is. It's his sister's, I bet!

19:56.182 --> 19:58.612
LAUGHTER

19:58.612 --> 20:02.062
A bit of a girly car, we think.

20:02.062 --> 20:05.512
Not a bit of. Completely, utterly...

20:05.512 --> 20:11.112
Girly. Not even a hairdresser's
car, it's her receptionist's!

20:11.112 --> 20:16.082
Have we got any more cars?
There we go. That's a Jeep Wrangler.

20:16.082 --> 20:23.562
Attractive? It's OK. It's a good
run-around in the country. Er, no.
Isn't it? No, they're shocking.

20:23.562 --> 20:26.612
No good in the snow or anything?

20:26.612 --> 20:31.362
Well, it's better than cycling,
but, you know. Yeah.

20:31.362 --> 20:35.862
Obviously, you're not just here
to discuss this. No.

20:35.862 --> 20:43.282
You're here to see how fast
you can drive our reasonably-priced
car round the track.

20:43.282 --> 20:45.822
How do you think you did?

20:45.822 --> 20:50.222
We've got Harry Enfield
at the bottom, and Jay Kay here.

20:50.222 --> 20:55.092
I'd be very pleased if I beat Boris.
Boris Johnson, at one minute 56.

20:55.092 --> 20:59.502
Shall we find out?
Let's have a look.

20:59.502 --> 21:02.452
Now, that's a racing start!

21:02.452 --> 21:06.942
I've got to be faster than Harry.
I've done that again.

21:06.942 --> 21:09.422
Not that you're a determined person!

21:10.402 --> 21:14.111
I've got to put my foot down.

21:16.392 --> 21:20.882
Over, over, over, over, over, over,
over, over, over.

21:20.882 --> 21:23.828
Over what? Just what he told me!

21:28.022 --> 21:31.242
ANNE LAUGHS IN STUDIO

21:31.242 --> 21:34.422
A bit too tight, I'd suggest, but...

21:34.422 --> 21:36.424
APPLAUSE

21:40.862 --> 21:45.382
Who'd like to know
how fast that was? I would!

21:45.382 --> 21:51.082
You think most big celebs won't
care, but you can see that they do.

21:51.082 --> 21:54.422
You wanted to beat Boris at 1.56.

21:54.422 --> 21:59.722
You did it in one minute
and 57 seconds. Oh!

21:59.722 --> 22:02.043
Just!

22:03.862 --> 22:08.502
I didn't beat Boris.
I'm really down the bottom!

22:08.502 --> 22:11.862
You were only a second off
Boris's time.

22:11.862 --> 22:17.502
Yeah, but Michael Gambon? Michael
Gambon's a lunatic! He's a maniac!

22:17.502 --> 22:23.082
He's the maddest driver I've seen!
I want to go round again now.

22:23.082 --> 22:26.872
You're welcome to go out again.
Jamie Oliver?

22:26.872 --> 22:31.902
I've done so badly! You haven't!
I have! I'm third bottom!

22:31.902 --> 22:36.982
Well, that's cos...we've been doing
the series for about 15 weeks...

22:36.982 --> 22:40.592
Don't placate me!
I've done really badly.

22:40.592 --> 22:45.382
These are people who are...
Ross Kemp, for goodness' sake!

22:45.382 --> 22:51.462
I'll never live this down.
I can't go back to Gloucestershire.
Ross Kemp's not in Gloucestershire.

22:51.462 --> 22:57.232
He's down the East End, beating
geezers up! He wants to come back.

22:57.232 --> 23:02.152
But these, like Gordon Ramsay, are
mad keen car petrolheads! Right.

23:02.152 --> 23:06.902
So I think that was a very good
time. Why are you being nice to me?

23:06.902 --> 23:11.512
Because you're lovely and
I adore you. Thank you for coming.

23:11.512 --> 23:15.460
Ladies and gentlemen,
Annie Robinson!

23:21.140 --> 23:25.080
The news.
We're feeling remiss this week.

23:25.080 --> 23:29.150
We like to think we're across
what's happening

23:29.150 --> 23:33.580
and out of the blue,
Ford introduce a new Mondeo.

23:33.580 --> 23:37.000
Who'd like to see it? Yeah.
Here it is.

23:37.000 --> 23:43.730
That's the old one.
No, that's the new Mondeo.
It's got 1,500 new parts.

23:43.730 --> 23:47.820
I bet they're the same shape
as the old parts.

23:47.820 --> 23:52.640
It's got a new radio. It has.
There's hundreds of bits in that.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.560
There's 1,500 parts in a radio!

23:55.560 --> 24:02.680
Here's news about a new system
to help protect car drivers
from road rage attack.

24:02.680 --> 24:06.600
It's a personal attack
warning system.

24:06.600 --> 24:12.880
If you hit the button,
it activates a 125 decibel siren,
people will notice!

24:12.880 --> 24:17.650
Causes the hazard lights to flash
and has a loud voice saying,

24:17.650 --> 24:21.800
"Help! Driver under attack,
call the police. "

24:21.800 --> 24:25.430
What interests me is...
What car's this for?

24:25.430 --> 24:29.960
It's Honda and if any car
is going to cause road rage,

24:29.960 --> 24:34.090
it's the old biffers
driving in Hondas!

24:34.090 --> 24:38.970
It should say, "Driver in a Honda! "
Stay away!

24:38.970 --> 24:44.000
They also give us top tips
for avoiding road rage!

24:44.000 --> 24:48.390
One - don't buy a Honda.
Don't drive so damn slowly!

24:48.390 --> 24:53.650
I want to see the top tips from
Honda on how to avoid road rage.

24:53.650 --> 24:58.640
"Acknowledge a mistake if you make
one with a wave, or say sorry. "

24:58.640 --> 25:02.670
I wave. I make lots of hand signals
at Hondas.

25:02.670 --> 25:05.380
"Don't lose your temper. "

25:05.380 --> 25:09.714
"Do not rise to any challenges. "
Like a duel?

25:11.110 --> 25:15.810
En garde! Your driving's angered me,
I demand satisfaction!

25:15.810 --> 25:18.440
I've got something interesting.

25:18.440 --> 25:23.650
I've been looking at cars with
folding metal rooves, like Ford.

25:23.650 --> 25:27.610
This is the first one,
the Peugeot 307.

25:27.610 --> 25:32.050
Look at this, it's fantastic.
It's very pretty.

25:32.050 --> 25:35.810
I'm not sure when it comes out
or its price.

25:35.810 --> 25:43.390
The other one is the Renault Megane,
which not only has a folding roof,
the middle bit is glass.

25:43.390 --> 25:48.530
The one that interests me is this,
the Daihatsu Copen from Japan -

25:48.530 --> 25:51.530
a 600cc engine, it'll cost £12,000.

25:51.530 --> 25:55.190
Even this, apparently,
has a metal folding roof.

25:55.190 --> 25:59.530
Can we fold the roof, please?
It's noisy.

25:59.530 --> 26:04.590
This is another example of the
Japanese taking a European idea

26:04.590 --> 26:09.670
and making it smaller. Those hours
spent on origami weren't wasted!

26:09.670 --> 26:11.750
Look at that!

26:11.750 --> 26:18.770
A couple of weeks ago, we had
the Ford Street Ka on and you said
a bloke couldn't drive it.

26:18.770 --> 26:22.960
There aren't any men in here to ask,
but anytay.

26:22.960 --> 26:25.810
I'm going to do a little experiment.

26:25.810 --> 26:31.610
We've got Sarah in the car
and she looks unutterably gorgeous.

26:31.610 --> 26:35.550
I'm going to have to ask you
to get out.

26:35.550 --> 26:40.070
And I want a bloke,
a good-looking bloke. You, sir.

26:40.070 --> 26:44.970
I want you to get in there and see
what this car does for your manhood.

26:44.970 --> 26:47.610
It's not looking promising.

26:47.610 --> 26:55.270
What do you think?
He was fine till the door slammed,
now he looks like a berk.

26:55.270 --> 26:57.920
I don't think a man could drive it.

26:57.920 --> 27:04.360
I think it's all
of these folding convertibles.
You know the Peugeot 206CC?

27:04.360 --> 27:09.090
I actually sometimes think
blokes can't have convertibles.

27:09.090 --> 27:14.770
Any? No, I've got one. I came out
the other day and it was sunny,

27:14.770 --> 27:19.780
I thought, "I can't get the roof
down, I'm a middle-aged man.

27:19.780 --> 27:24.890
"What message am I giving out?"
Blokes can't have convertibles.

27:24.890 --> 27:28.430
I have to stop you.
I hate to interrupt,

27:28.430 --> 27:32.780
but this is the biggest load
of limp-wristed twaddle

27:32.780 --> 27:35.440
I've heard in my five weeks of TV.

27:35.440 --> 27:38.980
These two...
These two are not men, OK?

27:38.980 --> 27:43.990
This one, every morning sticks
his head in a bucket of hair gel.

27:43.990 --> 27:46.980
He's got a dog, but it's a poodle.

27:46.980 --> 27:49.700
And you won't drink brown beer.

27:49.700 --> 27:53.864
This man said, "Flatulence
isn't funny. " When it is.

27:55.440 --> 27:59.630
That's true. I'm actually
the only bloke on this show.

27:59.630 --> 28:02.360
I live in a house full of bikes.

28:02.360 --> 28:07.047
I think a bloke can drive a
convertible, if it's the right one.

28:12.630 --> 28:15.400
Look at this f... ing weather!

28:15.400 --> 28:18.740
Actually, it's a perfect day

28:18.740 --> 28:21.540
for a British sports car

28:21.540 --> 28:25.909
and I've been waiting 30 years
for this moment.

28:34.050 --> 28:36.500
Triumph TR6! At last!

28:36.500 --> 28:39.640
It's fantastic!

28:41.130 --> 28:46.120
When I was a boy and other boys
were wondering how girls worked,

28:46.120 --> 28:52.161
I'd lie awake thinking about the
Triumph TR6. What's wrong with that?

28:54.260 --> 28:58.460
I think this is the blokiest
bloke's car ever built.

28:58.460 --> 29:01.980
I've seen women driving Ferraris,
Aston Martins

29:01.980 --> 29:07.000
and MGBs and just about any
sports car you care to mention.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.540
But I have never ever
seen a woman driving a TR6.

29:17.340 --> 29:24.200
The TR6 is rather gender specific.
And I expect women are angry about
that as well. But let me explain.

29:25.540 --> 29:27.760
Before the TR6,

29:27.760 --> 29:33.920
Triumph sports cars had
always looked a bit feminine
with soft curves and hips.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.560
But this one is different.

29:36.560 --> 29:39.200
There's a good reason for that.

29:39.200 --> 29:43.800
Triumphs were designed by an
Italian bloke called Michelotti.

29:43.800 --> 29:48.140
But when it was time
to do the TR6, he was too busy.

29:48.140 --> 29:51.490
So they gave the job
to some Germans.

29:51.490 --> 29:55.960
The German word for nipple
is Brustwarze -

29:55.960 --> 29:58.370
"breast wart".

29:58.370 --> 30:03.728
Here is a nation that may be relied
upon to produce a man's car.

30:05.210 --> 30:08.200
What a square head. Look at it.

30:08.200 --> 30:14.537
Blunt at both ends, thickset.
If this car went to the lavatory,
it would leave the seat up.

30:17.040 --> 30:24.600
Look at the engine. There aren't
any colour-coded filler caps to
stop me putting oil in the radiator.

30:24.600 --> 30:27.290
It's a proper sports car engine,

30:27.290 --> 30:30.800
made so that blokes
can own tool kits.

30:30.800 --> 30:35.490
There isn't an ounce of womanhood
anythere on this thing,

30:35.490 --> 30:41.450
except the wheels - like the front
of a washing machine... apparently.

30:41.450 --> 30:48.730
Good job they didn't
give it to a Frenchman, eh?
We'd all have handbags by now.

30:48.730 --> 30:55.050
Well, we'll have no
handbaggery here, thank you.
You can't mince around in this

30:55.050 --> 30:58.800
Iike you do in a small hatchback.

30:58.800 --> 31:02.290
Once you get behind the wheel
of a TR6,

31:02.290 --> 31:06.680
you realise that we chaps
have been horribly misled.

31:06.680 --> 31:11.610
Look at this lot driving executive
saloons. Is this what we want?

31:11.610 --> 31:16.690
Suddenly, I can see
modern manhood for what it is.

31:16.690 --> 31:23.310
I can't believe it's taken me so
long to work it out. Come on, chaps,
throw away your grooming products,

31:23.310 --> 31:27.804
get out of the post-feminist
society, this is what you want.

31:32.670 --> 31:34.860
'What a road!

31:34.860 --> 31:37.738
'What a car! What a day! '

31:41.450 --> 31:44.453
'Oh, God, have I left the iron on? '

31:46.750 --> 31:51.430
The day after I drove this,
I bought a copy of AutoTrader,

31:51.430 --> 31:56.310
Iocked myself in the toilet,
and tried to find one for sale.

31:56.310 --> 31:59.110
Great game. You have a subscription.

31:59.110 --> 32:02.110
Did you give yourself a budget? Yes.

32:02.110 --> 32:05.610
Rather too small, as it turned out.
Why? How much?

32:05.610 --> 32:08.030
I thought five or six grand.

32:08.030 --> 32:13.710
But for a really good one,
you're looking at ten or 11,

32:13.710 --> 32:16.770
and for one that's new, who knows.

32:16.770 --> 32:21.510
Yeah, but it's bloketastic
and I think it's got a lot of style.

32:21.510 --> 32:23.910
Time for some Top Gear science.

32:23.910 --> 32:28.590
We wanted to know if a bunch
of blokes - the Ford rally team -

32:28.590 --> 32:33.190
could change most of the mechanical
components on their car

32:33.190 --> 32:38.280
in less time than it takes
a group of women to get ready.

32:38.280 --> 32:45.679
So here we are at Ford Rally's HQ.
This is what they're going to be
changing on the rally car.

32:45.679 --> 32:51.269
We have the drive shafts - linkage,
suspension, springs, dampers.

32:51.269 --> 32:55.429
And we've got the hub assemblies,
the break discs,

32:55.429 --> 33:00.199
the gearbox, the front differential,
all the stuff to hold the wheel on,

33:00.199 --> 33:05.209
in fact, pretty much everything to
makes the wheels go round and stop.

33:05.209 --> 33:12.369
These are the Pirelli girls.
Their mission is to get ready
for a big night out.

33:12.369 --> 33:19.189
This is not a race. The guys are
going to do the work at the pace
they would under rally conditions,

33:19.189 --> 33:24.229
and the girls will do whatever
they do at their normal speed.

33:24.229 --> 33:29.259
And neither side knows how long
the other side is likely to take.

33:29.259 --> 33:34.561
So this is properly scientific.
If everybody's ready - on you go.

33:37.729 --> 33:39.435
Go! Commence.

33:43.599 --> 33:47.274
Look, that's the front. Right.
That's the back.

33:51.199 --> 33:55.699
It ties up. Oh, yeah and you've
got two side bits on there.

33:55.699 --> 34:00.189
With five minutes gone, the brake
discs have already been removed,

34:00.189 --> 34:05.019
as have the callipers, suspension
uprights and compression struts.

34:05.019 --> 34:08.129
The girls aren't finished
with that dress.

34:08.129 --> 34:14.034
That's like an inch ruched.
It's severely ruched.
What does it do?

34:16.139 --> 34:22.299
There's about an hour or so
deciding on the outfit, and then
there's a shoe consultation.

34:22.299 --> 34:24.659
I still don't know.

34:24.659 --> 34:27.219
What do you think?

34:27.219 --> 34:29.219
Uh...

34:29.219 --> 34:32.579
Out comes the gearbox.

34:32.579 --> 34:34.259
Boot.

34:34.259 --> 34:36.139
Boot.

34:36.139 --> 34:39.199
And in goes the new gearbox.

34:40.779 --> 34:42.299
Yeah, boot.

34:42.299 --> 34:47.018
The men work in a disciplined
silence. The girls don't.

34:47.018 --> 34:49.599
This is it. This is very important.

34:49.599 --> 34:54.309
Taxi - this shoe is good,
walking - this shoe is very bad.

34:55.879 --> 35:00.339
They have been talking
for seven and a half minutes.

35:00.339 --> 35:04.369
without a single fact
or piece of information

35:04.369 --> 35:07.699
being exchanged or imparted.

35:07.699 --> 35:14.059
15 minutes in, the rally team
have changed the clutch,
re-mounted the gearbox,

35:14.059 --> 35:20.239
replaced the drive shafts,
the differentials and they're
hard at work refitting the brakes.

35:20.239 --> 35:22.439
Back with the girls.

35:22.439 --> 35:24.909
Put Natalie Imbruglia on.

35:24.909 --> 35:30.359
Look - a place for everything
and everything in its place.

35:30.359 --> 35:32.309
Lovely.

35:32.309 --> 35:34.839
That's yours. Where's mine? There.

35:34.839 --> 35:39.569
I've got make-up all over my hands.
Where's yours? That IS mine.

35:39.569 --> 35:41.919
No, that's not mine.

35:41.919 --> 35:44.199
20 minutes in,

35:44.199 --> 35:46.679
and an eyelash goes on.

35:48.919 --> 35:53.209
27 minutes in,
and the rally team has finished.

35:53.209 --> 35:57.599
Remember, that's all of the
suspension, all of the brakes,

35:57.599 --> 36:02.309
the gearbox, the differentials and
the clutch and as for the girls...

36:02.309 --> 36:04.899
That goes round...

36:04.899 --> 36:09.699
Doesn't that bit hurt?
Well, you see... Don't know.

36:09.699 --> 36:12.008
ALL TALK AT ONCE

36:16.309 --> 36:18.519
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

36:18.519 --> 36:23.509
So the rally team got the car
changed in? 27 minutes. 27 minutes.

36:23.509 --> 36:26.719
And the women?
Dunno. Got bored, we left.

36:26.719 --> 36:31.309
We packed everything, off, still
going - talking, things like that.

36:31.309 --> 36:36.209
I don't think men and women should
be allowed to go out together.

36:36.209 --> 36:39.144
Men should go out with men.
You're making me nervous!

36:42.459 --> 36:45.559
Renault Clio. Ah.
The epitome of Euro chic.

36:45.559 --> 36:50.419
Coco Chanel would drive one
of these if she weren't dead.
LAUGHTER

36:50.419 --> 36:53.959
It's cheap to run, cheap to buy
and has a good safety record.

36:53.959 --> 36:58.100
But a new version
is none of those things.

37:02.379 --> 37:04.899
ENGINE PURRS

37:04.899 --> 37:07.159
Oh, listen to that!

37:07.159 --> 37:10.868
ENGINE PURRS
Oh, that's fantastic.

37:12.359 --> 37:17.919
Have you ever seen such an
amazingly funky little car?

37:17.919 --> 37:20.439
And there's so much power.

37:20.439 --> 37:24.279
And grip!
Grip's unbelievable.

37:24.279 --> 37:27.399
OK, let me show you.

37:27.399 --> 37:31.119
Up to 4,000rpm.

37:31.119 --> 37:34.859
Dump the clutch.
ENGINE REVS

37:34.859 --> 37:39.889
No wheel spin at all. That's
how much traction you've got.

37:39.889 --> 37:43.929
It catapults you into a world
of G-force and noise.

37:43.929 --> 37:47.039
Imagine watching the entire
French air force

37:47.039 --> 37:50.789
crash into a fireworks factory.

37:50.789 --> 37:53.879
That's how much of a laugh
this car is.

37:53.879 --> 38:00.859
So how have they turned
a frothy cappuccino into a pint
of super strong espresso?

38:00.859 --> 38:06.365
Well, part of the secret
is to be found under the bonnet.

38:06.366 --> 38:12.206
In a normal Clio, this is where
you'd expect to find the engine.

38:12.206 --> 38:16.722
But in this, they've fitted
a carry cot for your baby.

38:18.566 --> 38:24.276
You can't put your children on the
back seats because there aren't any.

38:24.276 --> 38:29.736
All the space is taken up with
the enormous 3-litre V6 engine.

38:29.736 --> 38:32.566
So, what about the boot?

38:32.566 --> 38:35.996
Well, that's only big enough
for a kipper.

38:35.996 --> 38:39.326
If, therefore,
you have some shopping,

38:39.326 --> 38:42.646
what I suggest you do is, um...

38:42.646 --> 38:44.944
throw it away.

38:46.546 --> 38:49.117
This is such a bloke's car.

38:52.646 --> 38:57.566
You start with a sensible hatchback,
then fill it full of engine.

38:57.566 --> 39:02.406
And who cares that you have to put
the baby under the bonnet?

39:02.406 --> 39:07.006
There are some other drawbacks,
like, for instance,

39:07.006 --> 39:11.006
the lever to adjust the seat
is down here.

39:11.006 --> 39:15.126
Only proctologists can reach it.
And I'm not one.

39:15.126 --> 39:19.756
It's the least manoeuvrable car
on the road.

39:19.756 --> 39:26.366
Oil tanker captains have said their
ships have the same turning circles.

39:26.366 --> 39:32.006
Life in this is a never-ending
stream of three-point turns.

39:32.006 --> 39:34.546
Then there's the equipment.

39:34.546 --> 39:39.836
You get an airbag, air-conditioning
and a cabin full of...air.

39:40.846 --> 39:43.906
It's not much, really, for £27,000.

39:43.906 --> 39:48.346
However, this is as mid-engined
as a supercar.

39:48.346 --> 39:52.406
It sounds like a supercar.

39:52.406 --> 39:55.396
It goes like a supercar.

39:55.396 --> 40:00.333
So, on that basis, it becomes
the bargain of the century.

40:02.436 --> 40:05.146
It'll do 155mph

40:05.146 --> 40:10.826
and out-accelerate the Porsche C4S
that we looked at earlier.

40:10.826 --> 40:14.506
I think it's fantastic.

40:14.506 --> 40:18.286
But there is one more test needed.

40:18.286 --> 40:23.336
Renault has put big engines in the
back of little hatchbacks for years.

40:23.336 --> 40:28.086
They did it with the Renault 5
and with the first Clio.

40:28.086 --> 40:32.846
Both cars had a reputation
for being savage beyond the limit.

40:32.846 --> 40:35.546
They just used to spin.

40:35.546 --> 40:38.496
To find out if this one is better,

40:38.496 --> 40:43.326
I've got to go out there and drive
round corners much too quickly.

40:43.326 --> 40:48.126
Time, therefore, to take
one of my special "brave pills".

40:48.126 --> 40:51.516
HE GULPS

40:51.516 --> 40:53.566
Ah!

40:53.566 --> 40:55.646
Right.

40:55.646 --> 40:58.656
ENGINE ACCELERATES

40:58.656 --> 41:04.246
We know it has high levels of grip,
but what happens if you exceed them?

41:04.246 --> 41:06.716
Lord!

41:06.716 --> 41:10.766
You get plenty of understeer

41:10.766 --> 41:16.146
to remind you you're near the limit.
It's OK, I've had my brave pills!

41:36.296 --> 41:39.246
Oh! Here we go again!

41:39.246 --> 41:41.916
Ah.

41:41.916 --> 41:44.386
You see,

41:44.386 --> 41:48.796
if you show it a difficult corner
it gives in.

41:48.796 --> 41:52.786
Sits in a cloud of its own smoke,

That's what I like doing,
cos I'm French!

42:09.076 --> 42:13.186
That is just
such a good-looking car.

42:13.186 --> 42:20.116
I drove the original and people
in Ferraris stopped to look at it.

42:20.116 --> 42:22.456
It's a Renault Clio. Incredible.

42:22.456 --> 42:29.556
They wondered why it took 66 bites
at the Low's Hairpin. The turning
circle! It spoils the glamour!

42:29.556 --> 42:37.076
This handling thing - you notice it
on a track, but on a road, it has
so much grip, you'll never notice.

42:37.076 --> 42:42.796
In my perfect ten-car garage -
I think all men have one - you do?

42:42.796 --> 42:45.716
Do you wanna know? Not now. OK.

42:45.716 --> 42:49.716
In that garage
I'd have one of these.

42:49.716 --> 42:55.516
What impresses me is you found
that limit and you went beyond it.

42:55.516 --> 42:59.996
It survived.
The old one didn't. I broke one.

42:59.996 --> 43:05.556
I broke several. Everyone has.
This survived and that's impressive.

43:05.556 --> 43:12.056
It more than survived - most cars
on the track normally go home

43:12.056 --> 43:15.136
in a Hoover bag - swept home.

43:15.136 --> 43:19.856
Not a single thing went wrong.
Didn't even wear its tyres out.

43:19.856 --> 43:24.726
But, before it gets the complete
clean bill of health, one more test.

43:24.726 --> 43:31.346
Mesdames et Messieurs,
bienvenue dans la pluie - Le Stig!

43:31.346 --> 43:34.176
This should be interesting.

43:34.176 --> 43:37.136
The Clio has so much grip,

43:37.136 --> 43:41.561
but the track today, frankly,
doesn't - it's soaking.

43:44.096 --> 43:47.031
Oh no, the Stig's gone all mullety!

43:48.536 --> 43:51.586
Looking fast up to Chicago.

43:51.586 --> 43:55.156
Ooh no, he's sliding!

43:55.156 --> 43:59.846
To get it back he'll have to be
a genius - which he is.

43:59.846 --> 44:04.966
Now, the Hammerhead. Mid-engined
Clio should hang on well. It is.

44:10.036 --> 44:13.646
That looks very quick.
First sector though!

44:13.646 --> 44:16.636
Above the Aston Martin Vanquish!

44:16.636 --> 44:21.646
That has an extra 200bhp! Come on
Stiggy! Into the penultimate corner!

44:21.646 --> 44:27.306
Keeps it tidy! He's sideways,
he's sideways! He's lost it!

44:27.306 --> 44:31.026
APPLAUSE

44:32.556 --> 44:39.516
Richard is rather hoping
it isn't a time up here.

44:39.516 --> 44:44.026
Are you taking the mickey with
the new board? The new tall board.

44:44.026 --> 44:47.226
He did it in 1m36.2s.

44:47.226 --> 44:51.946
That's not bad. Not bad?!
It's exactly the same time

44:51.946 --> 44:56.386
as the Aston Martin Vanquish.
Incredible.

44:56.386 --> 44:59.306
The Stig said, "I'll get it faster. "

44:59.306 --> 45:05.586
He kept going out, "I can get into
the 35s, I know I can!" He likes it.

45:05.586 --> 45:10.569
Who'd like to see what happened
when he really pushed it? Let's see.

45:11.286 --> 45:14.556
TYRES SCREECH

45:14.556 --> 45:17.386
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

45:17.386 --> 45:20.566
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Good old Stiggy!

45:20.566 --> 45:24.886
APPLAUSE

45:24.886 --> 45:27.466
He is clinically insane.

45:27.466 --> 45:29.457
But luckily he survived.
Good night.
