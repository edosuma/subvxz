01:53.906 --> 01:56.034
Roll them up separately!

01:56.451 --> 01:57.994
That's what I'm doing!
Rolling 'em up separately.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.669
- You have to flip it.
- Okay.

02:07.503 --> 02:08.880
Watch the spark!

02:09.047 --> 02:13.301
Look at this part.
Feel how smooth it is.

03:23.162 --> 03:23.955

03:42.640 --> 03:44.726
Ho-young! They're not anchovies!

03:44.809 --> 03:46.769
They're pomfrets! Get moving!

03:46.811 --> 03:48.438
Let's get those pomfrets!

03:48.646 --> 03:51.107
Kyung-koo! Call out the engineer!

03:52.233 --> 03:54.110
Dong-sik! Don't stand around.
Go help with the net.

03:55.153 --> 03:55.945
You mean this?

03:57.864 --> 03:58.781
What the hell?

03:59.449 --> 04:01.409
- He's caught!
- Turn off the drum winch!

04:03.327 --> 04:04.704
You have to be shitting me.

04:06.539 --> 04:08.916
- It's stuck!
- Hold the net tight!

04:12.962 --> 04:15.339
Just turn off the damn winch!

04:18.801 --> 04:19.594
Holy shit.

04:19.677 --> 04:20.511
The winch is jacked up.

04:20.511 --> 04:22.513
How the hell did you check
the equipment?

Hello, Captain.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.995
Still no fish.
They better catch some soon.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.085
That one. That one looks good.

05:39.423 --> 05:40.383
That one there.

05:40.383 --> 05:44.095
Already back before the tide?

05:44.345 --> 05:45.638
We missed a school of pomfrets...

05:46.222 --> 05:47.932
The drum winch got jacked up.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.644
We should do a complete
overhaul of the boat.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.105
Need to fix the radiator too.

05:54.105 --> 05:57.692
Why spend money to fix
that piece of junk?

05:57.733 --> 06:01.320
The government is reimbursing
old fishing boats now.

06:01.696 --> 06:07.702
They're even turning in
boats that are in good condition.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.620
Don't even joke about
giving away my boat.

06:10.705 --> 06:13.374
For people like me,
that's like denying your family.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.625
A load of crap.

06:14.625 --> 06:18.170
You can't give away the Junjin.
Never.

06:19.046 --> 06:23.134
Loan me some money
to feed my crew.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.510
You gotta be shitting me.

06:24.886 --> 06:25.803
Hey, Captain.

06:26.178 --> 06:28.973
Why is your sorry ass
is still a captain?

06:28.973 --> 06:30.224
It's thanks to us!

06:31.392 --> 06:33.477
You know what?

06:33.519 --> 06:37.481
We're turning in that boat,
get our money in the bank!

06:37.982 --> 06:39.942
Bank interest is good money now.

06:40.985 --> 06:42.445
Under the IMF crisis.

06:43.154 --> 06:44.071
Excuse...

06:44.989 --> 06:45.823
That rotten...!

06:46.824 --> 06:47.825
You little!

06:49.118 --> 06:50.036
You going somewhere?

07:13.184 --> 07:16.270
Why're you back so early?

07:17.188 --> 07:19.023
We returned with a full load.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.400
Heard it's tough these days...

07:21.901 --> 07:24.403
Your captain must be good.

07:24.904 --> 07:25.613
Yeah.

07:28.032 --> 07:30.201
Nana. Were you at the
market again?

07:30.201 --> 07:31.243
No.

07:31.369 --> 07:34.705
Told you not to work.
I can earn for both of us.

07:34.789 --> 07:39.418
How can I stay home when
my baby's working out at sea.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.760
You're home early. Done fishing?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.433
Excuse me.

08:37.643 --> 08:40.438
The restaurant and the house
are a complete mess.

08:41.147 --> 08:42.565
And you're here doing it
with that guy?

08:42.606 --> 08:43.816
Better than you.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.986
If you don't like it,
make yourself available.

08:47.486 --> 08:49.447
Or bring home some money.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.657
Husband my ass.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.247
The door is jammed.

08:59.248 --> 09:00.124
Where's the....

09:09.050 --> 09:11.510
Can't even pay for a motel?
You're so cheap.

09:11.594 --> 09:13.679
Shut up! Push up closer!

09:16.599 --> 09:17.850
Okay!

09:21.771 --> 09:23.230
It's so dark.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.399
- Mind the gap.
- What's going on?

09:25.983 --> 09:28.652
Kyung-koo brought a girl.

09:29.028 --> 09:31.989
With a call girl again?

09:36.619 --> 09:38.746
Not again.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.414
Oh, hello boys.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.003
I can't wait.

09:48.047 --> 09:50.800
Think of this as my yacht.

09:57.014 --> 09:59.850
To your left and right.
4 beds total.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.519
Take your pick.

10:01.602 --> 10:05.189
You guys sleep on
bunk beds like kids?

10:07.358 --> 10:08.025
What the...

10:08.109 --> 10:10.486
Thought you were going out
on the town tonight.

10:10.820 --> 10:13.656
What for? I live here.

10:14.532 --> 10:15.991
Okay, whatever.

10:16.534 --> 10:18.160
- I got a better place.
- Really?

10:18.202 --> 10:19.078
Follow me.

10:20.955 --> 10:22.206
What's your name, baby?

10:23.666 --> 10:24.333
Huh?

10:27.545 --> 10:29.505
We have to improvise.

10:29.588 --> 10:33.717
Let's try the captain's bed.
Real comfy.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.928
- Really?
- You don't trust me?

10:36.345 --> 10:37.721
Hold tight.

10:37.763 --> 10:38.639
There you go...

10:39.807 --> 10:40.683
Oh!

10:41.725 --> 10:43.686
How dare you bring a girl
on board!

10:47.356 --> 10:49.024
Kyung-koo, get a room.

10:49.066 --> 10:52.403
- Was the captain here?
- I didn't know either.

10:53.070 --> 10:55.906
Was he here all along?

10:56.198 --> 10:58.909
Is he sleeping on board
instead of home?

10:59.410 --> 11:02.246
- Wait up!
- I'm leaving.

11:02.246 --> 11:04.832
He's worried about the boat.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.544
Are they really selling the boat?

11:11.422 --> 11:13.048
It's burning. Flip it.

11:13.716 --> 11:14.550
Okay.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.615
Why do you need a big loan?

11:38.574 --> 11:39.783
I'm getting my boat back.

11:40.451 --> 11:43.287
Buying that piece of junk?

11:44.288 --> 11:46.332
Its value is practically nothing.

11:48.167 --> 11:48.876
Captain Kang.

11:49.084 --> 11:52.129
Your income last year
is a total mess.

11:52.504 --> 11:56.133
Your savings account is tapped out,
and you used up your loan.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.720
- Restaurant is mortagaged.
- What?

12:01.430 --> 12:03.182
Your wife's name is
Kim Jae-hwa, right?

12:10.439 --> 12:12.107
It's going to be difficult.

12:13.067 --> 12:15.653
It's not like the old days
for trawler captains.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.956
The red tide's been bad
for business, huh?

12:27.206 --> 12:28.499
It's not the red tide.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.709
It's my luck running out.

12:30.876 --> 12:35.172
Trawler captains used to spend money
like spoiled princes.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.469
Didn't you spend 2 million
in one day at a bar?

12:40.844 --> 12:43.722
It's become a legend here
in Dolsan Harbor.

12:44.807 --> 12:48.560
Even now you can fool around
with these girls all day.

12:48.852 --> 12:50.688
and still it doesn't cost 2 million.

12:51.522 --> 12:53.274
- Go outside.
- Okay.

12:55.192 --> 12:58.696
Guess times have really
been tough for you.

12:59.113 --> 13:00.864
Even coming to see me.

13:00.948 --> 13:01.740
Look...

13:03.325 --> 13:06.704
Do you still take those jobs?

13:08.372 --> 13:09.373
From China.

13:10.207 --> 13:11.083
Of course.

13:13.168 --> 13:14.545
You made a wise decision.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.714
Didn't you hear about
Captain Hong?

13:17.506 --> 13:20.050
He now became a construction
worker in Soonchon.

13:20.676 --> 13:22.052
He's hauling bricks
for Christ's sake.

13:22.886 --> 13:26.515
When I heard that,
it just broke my heart.

13:27.099 --> 13:30.269
Who are we?
We're sailors, aren't we?

13:30.519 --> 13:32.187
Sailors should make a living
at sea!

13:32.229 --> 13:36.066
Enough bullshit.
Just give me the coordinates.

13:44.908 --> 13:48.078
Captain. This is where the
money is now.

13:48.746 --> 13:51.081
Aren't you curious
what you're shipping?

13:51.373 --> 13:54.626
I just deliver.
Isn't it gold watches?

13:57.379 --> 14:00.507
I just got this job.
Smuggling immigrants.

14:01.717 --> 14:03.135
Not crates. Immigrants...

14:04.595 --> 14:06.889
Smuggling in
Korean-Chinese people.

14:07.639 --> 14:10.934
They call it 'croaker fishing'
in Incheon.

14:11.727 --> 14:15.939
The government started busting,
so it came down south.

14:16.607 --> 14:18.567
Now it's here in Yeosu.

14:19.151 --> 14:20.110
Here, the coordinates.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.865
Technically it's smuggling,

14:25.366 --> 14:27.659
but we're doing
a great service for our country.

14:29.495 --> 14:32.873
Without their cheap labor,
the economy won't sustain.

14:42.383 --> 14:45.469
For you and your wife.
Call it a deposit.

14:45.552 --> 14:49.390
This fake crap worth shit?
Are you kidding me?

14:50.015 --> 14:52.476
Trust is important in this
line of work.

14:52.976 --> 14:56.897
Let it be a symbol of
our mutual trust.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.322
This is the actual deposit.

15:08.534 --> 15:09.493
What if we get caught?

15:09.910 --> 15:13.914
Just bring them over
in the fish hold.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.792
What if we get caught with them
on the boat?

15:17.501 --> 15:20.796
That's the Junjin crew's business.

15:21.171 --> 15:23.841
That's a given
when transporting cargo.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.252
Name check for the departing crew.

16:04.339 --> 16:05.340
Bos'n.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.010
- And you, Kyung-koo?
- I'm on drum winch duty.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.554
- I'm Dong-sik.
- Dong-sik.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.723
- Where's Chang-wook?
- He's in the engine room.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.478
Chang-wook?

16:18.979 --> 16:19.771
Here.

16:20.063 --> 16:20.898
You're the engineer?

16:21.732 --> 16:22.566
Yeah, so?

16:22.733 --> 16:23.525
You?

16:26.528 --> 16:28.405
That asshole.

16:28.697 --> 16:30.616
One, two, three, four, five.

16:31.575 --> 16:33.744
How come the crew is so small
these days?

16:33.952 --> 16:36.079
The catch isn't so good.
That's why.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.207
The weather forecast
doesn't look good.

16:38.916 --> 16:41.502
We can't just sit around.
Gotta at least try.

16:41.919 --> 16:44.171
I hope you catch enough
to cover the gas.

17:02.105 --> 17:05.067
Wan-ho, this should stop.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.612
Are you going to hide forever?

17:09.613 --> 17:12.574
For as long as I owe money.

17:13.157 --> 17:16.619
I'm a sailor. I'm fine as long as
I end up on a boat.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.874
What's with the oil on your face?

17:20.915 --> 17:23.210
Here, let me help.

17:23.794 --> 17:25.587
I look cool, right?

17:26.255 --> 17:28.632
You know I... Kyung-koo.

17:28.966 --> 17:30.467
...fixed up the engine room.

17:31.635 --> 17:34.638
Get everyone in the the cabin.
I have something to say.

17:36.473 --> 17:41.061
If we get caught,
don't we all go to prison?

17:41.144 --> 17:44.147
Of course.
Smuggling immigrants ain't a joke.

17:44.815 --> 17:46.191
How much are we getting?

17:46.233 --> 17:48.110
Forget the money.

17:48.277 --> 17:51.697
How can the captain decide
without telling us?

17:51.780 --> 17:54.700
Imagine why he'd go to
that snake, Yeo.

17:54.992 --> 17:56.493
It's cuz he cares about us.

17:56.660 --> 18:01.748
Still! Transporting people
won't be easy.

18:02.499 --> 18:07.337
Then there'll be chicks among
the immigrants, right?

18:13.719 --> 18:14.761
Sit, sit.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.514
Bos'n.

18:18.307 --> 18:20.183
This is an advance for all.

18:21.476 --> 18:24.896
Once we unload the immigrants,
you get the rest.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.149
So let's not screw up. Okay?

18:28.025 --> 18:32.362
Wan-ho, let's do a complete overhaul
on the engine room.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.323
- But...
- Come on!

18:34.990 --> 18:35.991
Eat.

18:39.870 --> 18:41.079
Let's go eat.

18:47.044 --> 18:49.921
<i>Heavy rain is expected,
so stay cautious.</i>

18:50.213 --> 18:55.218
<i>At sea, waves up to 4 meters
are expected.</i>

18:55.927 --> 18:59.723
<i>Wave alert in effect tonight
all across the South Sea.</i>

19:00.223 --> 19:03.018
<i>But should be calm tomorrow
once the rain stops.</i>

19:03.018 --> 19:04.186
<i>Colder temperatures...</i>

19:04.227 --> 19:06.772
- Captain. Your dinner.
- Come in.

19:15.864 --> 19:16.657
What?

19:17.407 --> 19:18.492
Have you ever...

19:19.660 --> 19:21.536
smuggled in people before?

19:26.458 --> 19:29.503
Don't tell your grandmother.
You got that?

19:30.545 --> 19:32.589
- Yes, sir.
- Go on.

19:33.590 --> 19:34.341
Yes, Captain.

19:47.771 --> 19:50.065
It's raining hard.
You think it's okay?

19:50.524 --> 19:52.275
Don't worry. It's gonna pass.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.905
<i>How many are we boarding?</i>

20:01.243 --> 20:02.953
Bos'n! Ho-young!

20:03.370 --> 20:05.038
- Yes, Captain!
- 10 o'clock.

20:05.372 --> 20:08.291
I see a boat coming.
Go take a look.

20:08.709 --> 20:10.127
Chang-wook! Dong-sik!

20:11.628 --> 20:13.588
Dong-sik. You watch this side.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.387
Chang-wook! Do you see anything?

20:21.096 --> 20:22.723
It's too dark.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.727
I can't see anything
cuz of the rain.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.729
10 o'clock.
Up ahead in the distance.

20:28.937 --> 20:30.564
I know! I'm looking.

20:31.440 --> 20:34.317
It should be a small boat.
Keep a close watch!

20:38.071 --> 20:39.698
- It's here!
- Where? Where!

20:39.740 --> 20:40.699
9 o'clock.

20:40.824 --> 20:42.826
- Over there.
- Where?

20:42.868 --> 20:44.077
Turn on the searchlight!

20:45.829 --> 20:47.998
Wait. Need to make sure.

20:48.999 --> 20:50.625
If it's the right one,
they'll signal.

21:04.765 --> 21:06.349
That must be the right boat.

21:14.524 --> 21:16.860
What is this? A game?

21:21.490 --> 21:23.617
- What the fuck?
- It's a freighter?

21:26.870 --> 21:27.871
Attention!

21:28.205 --> 21:29.790
Let's get ready!

21:30.165 --> 21:31.541
Load them up quick.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.586
- Is this the Junjin?
- Yes.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.923
Bring the boat closer! Be careful!

21:38.006 --> 21:39.382
- What?
- Throw the rope!

21:39.382 --> 21:40.300
Boat closer!

21:48.350 --> 21:50.227
- Pull it!
- Sending your way!

21:50.268 --> 21:51.228
Throw the bags!

21:51.228 --> 21:52.604
Jump, jump!

22:00.904 --> 22:01.947
It's okay.

22:02.906 --> 22:04.533
It's okay. Jump!

22:18.713 --> 22:20.340
Now!

22:22.801 --> 22:24.594
Watch where you jump!

22:24.761 --> 22:26.263
Whose bag is this?

22:28.723 --> 22:30.559
This is a complete mess.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.270
Hurry up. Jump!

22:34.104 --> 22:35.397
Go to the back!

22:37.440 --> 22:39.568
Hey, sit down!

22:42.028 --> 22:43.572
Please help these women.

22:45.073 --> 22:47.576
Shit! That's bad luck.
Women on my ship...

22:48.493 --> 22:50.120
- Hold on!
- I got you.

22:50.287 --> 22:51.872
I want to do it. Let me!

22:53.790 --> 22:55.709
Here. Come to me!

22:59.296 --> 23:01.006
- Stretch your arm!
- I got it!

23:01.047 --> 23:02.966
- Now!
- One, two, three!

23:07.721 --> 23:08.638
Watch your step.

23:08.722 --> 23:11.725
Hey, you. Come to me!

23:11.808 --> 23:14.311
I'll grab you. Over here!

23:14.978 --> 23:17.564
Do you want to get caught?
Hurry up!

23:17.606 --> 23:18.815
Haven't got all night.

23:18.899 --> 23:19.900
Over here!

23:25.947 --> 23:28.867
It's okay! Trust me!

23:29.284 --> 23:30.869
Give me your hand!

23:32.245 --> 23:33.413
Don't look down!

23:34.414 --> 23:35.248
Here.

23:44.841 --> 23:46.635
Untie the ropes!

23:46.718 --> 23:47.886
Dong-sik, put these away!

23:48.011 --> 23:50.680
No, no! Someone fell in the water!

23:55.560 --> 23:56.937
Dong-sik!

23:56.978 --> 23:58.229
Son of a bitch.

23:58.730 --> 23:59.606
Dong-sik!

24:06.071 --> 24:07.614
Turn on the searchlight!

24:07.656 --> 24:09.240
Chang-wook! Quick!

24:12.577 --> 24:14.496
- Where'd he go?
- Dong-sik!!

24:21.753 --> 24:23.505
Captain Kang, turn on the lights!

24:23.797 --> 24:25.882
Dong-sik's going to die out there.

24:26.341 --> 24:28.009
That crazy son of a bitch.

24:30.261 --> 24:32.889
- Dong-sik!
- Where are you?

25:01.209 --> 25:03.044
Hold tight.

25:27.610 --> 25:28.862
We have to do mouth-to-mouth.

25:29.529 --> 25:32.115
She needs mouth-to-mouth.

25:32.157 --> 25:35.285
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- What?

25:36.202 --> 25:37.162
She needs it.

25:37.495 --> 25:40.957
Dong-sik! Are you crazy?

25:42.292 --> 25:44.836
Waves can swallow you up!
You think it's a joke?

25:47.130 --> 25:48.423
Let's all gather over here!

25:49.966 --> 25:51.551
Don't go in there!

25:51.593 --> 25:53.970
Keep everyone out of
the engine room!

25:59.476 --> 26:02.145
Are we supposed to give these out?

26:02.854 --> 26:07.317
You ignorant bastard.
Never been on Korean Air?

26:07.358 --> 26:09.277
Meals are served right after
take off.

26:09.319 --> 26:11.196
Like you've been on one.

26:11.279 --> 26:12.447
Now...

26:14.991 --> 26:17.160
each person take one ramen.

26:17.368 --> 26:20.914
- Take just one.
- Water is limited, so take what's given.

26:29.089 --> 26:31.007
Oh, no... You're all wet.

26:34.010 --> 26:35.678
Which do you want?

26:36.971 --> 26:37.847
Thank you.

26:39.390 --> 26:40.850
Chang-wook. Chang-wook!

26:42.310 --> 26:43.311
What are you doing?

26:43.853 --> 26:46.689
Look at that guy sitting
dangerously on the anchor line.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.024
Go stop him!

26:48.608 --> 26:51.069
- Come out of there!
- Sorry, no more water.

26:54.197 --> 26:55.532
Oh, no. You're all wet...

26:56.991 --> 26:58.660
Here, this will warm you up.

27:01.162 --> 27:04.165
Haven't I seen you before?

27:06.084 --> 27:07.293
Open the thermos.

27:09.129 --> 27:09.921
Sure we haven't met?

27:11.548 --> 27:15.176
You have to put this away.

27:16.427 --> 27:18.847
Why did you? That's your food.

27:20.348 --> 27:22.267
You really meant for us to eat it?

27:24.018 --> 27:25.395
Is this boat going straight in?

27:26.563 --> 27:28.439
Yeah, of course.

27:28.898 --> 27:29.732
Are you sure?

27:31.067 --> 27:33.695
Yes, I'm sure.
Why're you so suspicious?

27:34.320 --> 27:35.321
Then why hand these out?

27:36.573 --> 27:37.782
This is to put us

27:38.408 --> 27:40.994
in the fish hold for days,
so we can shit here.

27:42.829 --> 27:45.206
What? Why shit in that?
There's a bathroom.

27:45.290 --> 27:46.583
There's a bathroom back there!

27:47.333 --> 27:48.418
Is this your first smuggling job?

27:49.836 --> 27:50.461
Why?

27:51.171 --> 27:52.046
Listen up!

27:52.964 --> 27:55.842
Don't eat it. Salty food will
only make you thirsty.

27:57.302 --> 27:58.553
This is our toilet.

27:59.137 --> 28:03.892
- What's his problem?
- We're only trying to be nice.

28:03.975 --> 28:05.268
Don't sit on the net.

28:09.939 --> 28:11.566
- You shouldn't be here.
- What?

28:12.358 --> 28:14.944
Come, It's cold out.
Watch your feet.

28:17.322 --> 28:18.740
What are you doing?

28:19.115 --> 28:20.617
It's okay. Go inside.

28:21.910 --> 28:22.911
Watch your head.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.585
Where're you taking me?

28:31.544 --> 28:34.505
This is the engine room.
Never seen one before, right?

28:38.968 --> 28:41.763
It's a little noisy,
but it's nice and warm.

28:42.931 --> 28:44.265
What are you waiting for?

28:52.482 --> 28:54.567
Watch your head.

29:04.994 --> 29:06.162
I can go by myself.

29:14.337 --> 29:15.713
- Come here.
- Let me go.

29:16.881 --> 29:18.591
- Let me go!
- Stay still.

29:22.220 --> 29:23.680
This is the best for seasickness.

29:24.681 --> 29:25.682
What are you doing?

29:25.848 --> 29:28.851
You have to rub the arm
and circulate the blood first.

29:29.352 --> 29:31.771
My grandma just shoves
the needle right in.

29:32.730 --> 29:35.316
Your grandmother is wrong.

29:35.775 --> 29:36.693
Here...

29:39.195 --> 29:41.406
Too late for that. Hands off!

29:58.131 --> 30:00.049
Thank you...

30:01.551 --> 30:03.261
for saving my life earlier.

30:04.387 --> 30:08.516
That was nothing.
I'm a sailor, you know.

30:09.976 --> 30:10.977
Sit over there.

30:22.613 --> 30:25.742
Do you remember
what happened in the water?

30:27.076 --> 30:27.994
Yes.

30:28.661 --> 30:33.750
You squeezed my neck so tight,
I thought it'd break.

30:34.208 --> 30:36.586
- Really?
- Yeah...

30:41.758 --> 30:42.967
What's your blood type?

30:44.427 --> 30:46.137
Why do you ask?

30:48.556 --> 30:50.850
I'm a type O.

30:53.186 --> 30:55.938
Hey! You're not nauseous anymore.

30:57.315 --> 30:59.984
- Hold on a minute.
- Where are you going?

31:00.318 --> 31:01.444
Just wait a sec.

31:04.238 --> 31:07.367
Captain Kang.
Why'd you stop the boat?

31:08.451 --> 31:09.452
We're on standby.

31:10.411 --> 31:13.790
It's too risky to go in now.
They're going to call us.

31:14.665 --> 31:16.334
We'll just have to wait.

31:19.212 --> 31:24.425
Going to keep them out like that?
What if someone sees?

31:24.842 --> 31:26.886
There're no boats at this hour.

31:28.221 --> 31:30.973
Don't worry. I'll put them all
in the fish hold.

31:32.266 --> 31:33.309
The fish hold.

31:34.143 --> 31:37.939
You should get some sleep,
or something to eat.

31:39.482 --> 31:43.486
Dong-sik just took the last ramen.

31:44.946 --> 31:47.657
You can't pamper him
cuz he's young.

31:48.116 --> 31:49.158
He has to learn the work.

31:53.704 --> 31:55.832
Why did the boat suddenly stop?

31:56.791 --> 31:58.960
Probably nothing. Maybe just to
meet the schedule.

32:00.420 --> 32:02.338
Have you ever tried this in China?

32:02.713 --> 32:05.425
Of course. This is 'fanbeimei'.

32:06.175 --> 32:06.884
What?

32:07.552 --> 32:08.469
Pang-gah-mae.

32:09.679 --> 32:10.555
Pangahmae.

32:11.681 --> 32:15.518
Guess that's what you call it.
You have it in China too?

32:16.602 --> 32:18.688
I've never had this kind before.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.732
It's 'cup'-pangahme.

32:24.569 --> 32:27.447
It's probably ready.
Careful, it's hot.

32:29.949 --> 32:32.785
Look at me. I forgot the kimchi.

32:32.952 --> 32:34.162
No, it's okay.

33:04.567 --> 33:06.152
Do you want some?

33:06.652 --> 33:09.447
No, you go ahead and eat.

33:18.456 --> 33:19.707
Can I have a sip?

33:34.514 --> 33:37.141
It's good.

33:37.892 --> 33:39.435
You made it...

33:40.228 --> 33:41.270
Right.

33:42.939 --> 33:45.775
Actually, this isn't the
real deal.

33:46.317 --> 33:49.028
To cook the real pangahmae
that we fishermen eat,

33:49.612 --> 33:52.907
you start with the seafood.

33:53.157 --> 33:56.118
Crabs, sea squirts, octopus,
sea cucumbers, oysters,

33:56.786 --> 33:58.538
and turban shells.
You put these in.

33:58.663 --> 34:01.624
Then the sliced up hot pepper.

34:01.749 --> 34:05.378
That's a real pangahmae fit for
a Yeosu fisherman.

34:06.295 --> 34:08.047
You wouldn't know.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.842
By the way, how old are you
to keep talking down?

34:17.639 --> 34:18.558
I'm...

34:19.809 --> 34:21.143
twenty-six.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.605
- Born in 1974?
- Yeah.

34:25.606 --> 34:26.815
Never mind then.

34:29.485 --> 34:31.320
What's your name?

34:32.697 --> 34:34.949
I'm Dong-sik.

34:36.033 --> 34:36.867
You?

34:38.494 --> 34:40.496
I'm Hong-mae. Hong-mae.

34:41.371 --> 34:42.415
Hong-mae...

34:43.666 --> 34:46.252
How'd you end up on a
boat like this?

34:46.960 --> 34:48.920
I'm going to Korea
to find my older brother.

34:50.755 --> 34:55.094
He's been gone for 6 years,
but we haven't heard from him.

34:56.554 --> 34:58.889
What's your relation to
this brother?

34:59.974 --> 35:02.268
You don't know what a brother is?

35:02.435 --> 35:04.854
Course I know. Your real brother?

35:05.896 --> 35:08.357
- Yes.
- Oh!

35:09.191 --> 35:11.611
It's just that in Korea, girls have
many kinds of brothers.

35:13.988 --> 35:17.992
So... where is your brother?

35:18.909 --> 35:20.369
In Seoul...

35:22.705 --> 35:24.457
Oh, no!

35:25.333 --> 35:27.710
It's all wet.

35:30.212 --> 35:33.049
#247-6 Guro 3-dong.

35:34.258 --> 35:35.468
Guro 3-dong.

35:37.595 --> 35:40.723
Guro Gongdan Station.
On subway line #2.

35:40.931 --> 35:44.393
I've been there. The subway
runs above ground.

35:45.478 --> 35:48.230
- Then it's not a subway.
- No, it is.

35:48.564 --> 35:50.149
It just runs above ground.

35:50.441 --> 35:53.486
Then they should call it
an aboveground train.

35:59.158 --> 36:01.327
I should go up to the deck.

36:03.079 --> 36:06.207
You can stay here.
I'll talk to the engineer.

36:06.332 --> 36:10.628
I can't stay here when
everyone else is in the cold.

36:12.296 --> 36:13.506
Thank you for the ramen.

36:17.009 --> 36:19.261
Have you already been to
the engine room?

36:19.679 --> 36:20.388
Sorry?

36:21.013 --> 36:24.433
I saw everything.
What did you do there?

36:25.017 --> 36:26.352
What are you talking about?

36:26.769 --> 36:32.316
A woman on a smuggling boat's
engine room, it's obvious.

36:34.610 --> 36:36.946
Get yourself a marriage certificate
as soon as we arrive.

36:37.279 --> 36:39.490
Then you'll be a Korean citizen.

36:40.116 --> 36:42.118
You won't get deported.

36:42.284 --> 36:44.995
I'm not interested. Stop it.

36:45.538 --> 36:50.042
He looked cute for a fisherman.
Nice little face and all.

36:51.127 --> 36:53.337
You're unbelievable.

36:53.546 --> 36:56.882
Why did you come back out?
It's warm in there.

36:58.092 --> 37:00.678
Go back in. Come on.

37:18.988 --> 37:22.324
Cover her feet too. It's cold.

37:24.326 --> 37:27.288
Anyone else hurt?

37:27.538 --> 37:29.373
Can I get a Band-Aid?

37:40.593 --> 37:42.011
What are you doing?

37:43.012 --> 37:44.555
Nothing, nothing...

37:48.684 --> 37:50.352
I'm sure we met before.

37:50.561 --> 37:52.354
What on earth are you
talking about?

37:52.480 --> 37:53.689
Come here.

37:57.777 --> 38:00.237
Did you drink the water
I gave you?

38:00.404 --> 38:03.073
- Are you warm now?
- Not warm enough.

38:04.700 --> 38:08.954
I better take you to a
warmer place then.

38:09.288 --> 38:11.874
Well, if you insist.

38:12.875 --> 38:14.710
Watch the ropes.

38:23.385 --> 38:25.888
Can I sleep here?

38:26.222 --> 38:27.515
Of course.

38:28.432 --> 38:30.184
Do you have leftover blankets?

38:30.726 --> 38:31.602
Blankets?

38:31.644 --> 38:34.522
We'll have nice, soft blankets
on the floor.

38:34.563 --> 38:38.400
Can I stay here until
we arrive, huh?

38:39.235 --> 38:42.363
That's exactly what I want.

38:44.073 --> 38:45.783
You can stay for a thousand years.

38:47.201 --> 38:50.996
We can fool around all we want.

39:05.886 --> 39:06.804
Hey!

39:08.264 --> 39:10.099
What the fuck?

39:10.933 --> 39:14.353
- Pull it out, you little shit!
- Hold on!

39:16.146 --> 39:20.568
Told you not to do it
on the boat! It's bad luck!

39:22.862 --> 39:23.988
I was almost there.

39:23.988 --> 39:27.074
- Get out!
- I'm staying!

39:27.283 --> 39:28.784
Get a grip!

39:28.951 --> 39:30.327
I didn't do it!

39:30.995 --> 39:32.288
- Get out!
- I'm going!

39:34.123 --> 39:35.040
Get over there!

39:37.877 --> 39:39.628
Asshole.

39:41.213 --> 39:43.048
Careful not to catch a cold.

40:06.030 --> 40:07.448
Thank you.

40:12.411 --> 40:18.667
Can I ask what you do? How can you
read a book in the middle of all this?

40:19.168 --> 40:21.337
I was a grade school teacher.

40:21.754 --> 40:22.838
Oh my...

40:24.048 --> 40:27.343
A school teacher on
a boat like this.

40:28.677 --> 40:32.723
We can make 10 times more
working in Korea.

40:33.140 --> 40:34.141
You know that.

40:37.019 --> 40:40.272
No one here is going there
to stuff his own belly.

40:41.190 --> 40:44.735
They're all going for their
families back home.

40:45.736 --> 40:47.696
It's the same for us.

40:48.864 --> 40:50.032
What is that?

40:50.407 --> 40:52.660
My wife and daughters.

40:53.994 --> 40:58.791
Your daughters are very pretty.

41:26.735 --> 41:28.570
<i>Wake up. Boat approaching.</i>

41:30.030 --> 41:31.824
<i>Wake your asses up!</i>

41:32.700 --> 41:33.951
<i>There's a boat coming!</i>

41:49.133 --> 41:50.843
Sit down, sit down.

41:56.265 --> 41:57.725
Listen closely.

41:57.808 --> 42:00.102
A boat is coming,
so get in the fish hold.

42:00.269 --> 42:01.937
If they see you, we get
in trouble.

42:02.104 --> 42:05.607
Dong-sik, open the hatch.
And get the ladder.

42:05.649 --> 42:07.401
Hurry up and help him.

42:11.530 --> 42:12.448
Be careful!

42:12.531 --> 42:14.408
Move out of the way.

42:14.742 --> 42:16.535
Use the ladder to go down.

42:16.618 --> 42:18.996
Be careful.
It's deeper than you think.

42:20.622 --> 42:21.790
Don't push!

42:21.957 --> 42:22.791
<i>To the engine room.</i>

42:24.668 --> 42:27.129
No, I won't go.

42:29.798 --> 42:31.467
Want me there instead?

42:31.633 --> 42:32.801
Come here.

42:51.361 --> 42:54.323
Hurry up with the ladder! Come on!

42:55.783 --> 42:58.243
Come on, hurry. Out the way.

42:58.660 --> 43:01.371
Careful. Hold my hand.

43:01.997 --> 43:06.168
Move out the way! Move!

43:09.379 --> 43:12.424
Poor thing. It smells bad, right?

43:15.969 --> 43:20.057
- Do I have to go in there?
- I know, it's horrible.

43:20.140 --> 43:21.725
<i>Not on the net.</i>

43:21.850 --> 43:23.352
I knew this would happen.

43:23.602 --> 43:25.020
I'd better give you the
acupuncture remedy again.

43:26.146 --> 43:27.231
Come here.

43:29.108 --> 43:31.026
It's the smell.

43:32.027 --> 43:34.154
That's what we fishermen
smell like.

43:34.196 --> 43:35.989
Dong-Sik! Fetch the mop!

43:37.950 --> 43:39.701
- Go inside.
- Again?

43:41.537 --> 43:44.540
Stay in the engine room
until we arrive.

43:45.791 --> 43:48.794
No, it doesn't feel right.

43:51.713 --> 43:54.883
I can't stand you being in
the fish hold.

43:57.219 --> 43:58.011
Hey!

43:58.887 --> 44:00.848
Are you going to put us
in there again?

44:02.224 --> 44:04.685
That fish hold is no place
for people.

44:05.227 --> 44:07.312
It's meant for fish.

44:07.688 --> 44:11.650
There's nowhere else to hide.
Just hang on.

44:12.234 --> 44:14.695
You'll get used to it
after a couple of times.

44:16.405 --> 44:17.948
It can be several days.

44:18.574 --> 44:21.076
Let us in the cabin or
the engine room.

44:21.743 --> 44:22.828
Put us somewhere else.

44:24.329 --> 44:25.998
The engine room? Yeah, right.

44:26.999 --> 44:31.253
Why didn't you just take
Korean Air then?

44:31.461 --> 44:34.423
We paid a lot to be on this boat.

44:35.424 --> 44:37.259
Didn't you get your cuts?

44:37.718 --> 44:41.305
How can you treat fellow Koreans
worse than the Chinese?

44:41.763 --> 44:42.764
Don't you agree?

44:42.931 --> 44:45.434
Yeah! He's right!

44:48.145 --> 44:49.938
Fellow Korean my ass.

44:50.272 --> 44:52.107
Do you know what IMF is?

44:52.608 --> 44:55.569
These are rough times, pal.
Fellow Koreans?

44:55.944 --> 44:59.448
It's hard enough cuz of
the IMF crisis!

44:59.489 --> 45:00.449
Give us our money back!

45:02.034 --> 45:04.578
You low-life scumbags. Sit down!

45:19.760 --> 45:21.345
Sit down. Sit.

45:21.428 --> 45:23.222
You South Korean scumbag!

45:23.263 --> 45:25.724
I'll fucking kill you!

45:26.475 --> 45:27.768
Captain!

45:29.186 --> 45:30.229
Captain!

45:30.270 --> 45:32.814
You have to save him.
He could get killed!

45:33.815 --> 45:35.817
Then you stay in the engine room?

45:39.488 --> 45:40.656
Captain Kang!

45:41.490 --> 45:43.492
Stop! That's Dong-sik!

45:44.993 --> 45:47.537
- You'll kill him.
- Yeah, it's enough.

45:47.663 --> 45:48.622
Bos'n.

45:48.830 --> 45:51.083
- Yes, Captain.
- Throw him in the water.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.752
Are you deaf?!

45:55.587 --> 45:56.672
Move over!

46:01.468 --> 46:03.345
No, no!

46:03.387 --> 46:06.139
- One, two, three!
- No!

46:10.727 --> 46:12.688
You motherfuckers!

46:13.814 --> 46:15.899
You fucking assholes!

46:18.402 --> 46:19.278
Listen up!

46:19.778 --> 46:23.407
On this boat, I'm the president,
the judge, and your freakin' father!

46:25.617 --> 46:29.371
Your life is in my hands.
Understand?

46:33.583 --> 46:35.711
Please forgive us.

46:35.919 --> 46:37.045
<i>Please help me!</i>

46:40.716 --> 46:43.176
- Please help! Help!
- Let's go inside.

46:43.427 --> 46:46.096
- Please save me!
- Dong-sik, go help him.

46:46.179 --> 46:48.557
I want to live!

46:50.142 --> 46:52.436
Fucking South Korean scumbags.

46:52.769 --> 46:53.895
Fuck!

46:57.065 --> 47:00.902
Try to bear the smell a bit.
I'll keep the hatch open.

47:01.611 --> 47:04.072
Thank you. See you later.

47:08.994 --> 47:12.956
How could you...?
This wasn't the deal!

47:13.040 --> 47:15.584
- It's the bos'n.
- Hey, Kyung-koo.

47:16.752 --> 47:19.171
You go help Dong-Sik
with the rope.

47:19.504 --> 47:20.297
Yes, sir.

47:20.380 --> 47:23.675
Asshole. Go fuck yourself.

47:23.925 --> 47:25.385
Let me help you with your bag.

47:25.427 --> 47:26.720
Get off me.

47:26.887 --> 47:31.266
- Let me help you go in.
- Hey! What is this!

47:50.786 --> 47:51.870
Get up.

47:53.121 --> 47:54.289
It's nice in here, right?

47:54.456 --> 48:00.295
Once I put this blanket here,
it'll be like first class.

48:01.129 --> 48:02.798
This blanket's clean.

48:03.882 --> 48:05.801
You just sit back and relax.

48:07.010 --> 48:08.345
Wait a minute.

48:08.970 --> 48:11.431
Are you trying to take
advantage of me?

48:12.849 --> 48:15.394
No way.

48:16.269 --> 48:17.604
Never.

48:17.646 --> 48:21.358
I'm not capable of doing
such a thing. Really!

48:26.571 --> 48:27.656
I mean...

48:28.698 --> 48:32.160
I can do it cuz I'm a man.
Healthy and all...

48:33.328 --> 48:37.874
But I'm not the kind
who'd treat a lady like that.

48:38.500 --> 48:40.544
Yeah... That's what I meant.

49:12.200 --> 49:15.412
When I go to Seoul,
I'll invite you to Guro 3-dong.

49:16.037 --> 49:18.540
- I promise.
- Really?

49:19.541 --> 49:21.168
Seoul is very far away.

49:21.751 --> 49:24.880
You can take a few days off.

49:25.881 --> 49:29.092
True... Will you let me sleep
at your place?

49:32.304 --> 49:35.974
We always have days off when
we return from sea.

49:38.393 --> 49:40.437
Promise me you'll come?

49:41.062 --> 49:43.440
Dong-sik? Are you in here?

49:45.525 --> 49:46.276
Yes?

49:46.526 --> 49:48.528
What are you doing? Get up here.

49:49.738 --> 49:50.572
Wan-ho!

49:51.072 --> 49:51.948
What?

49:53.575 --> 49:55.494
Come here.

49:56.786 --> 50:00.707
Is it okay if Hong-mae stays here?

50:01.833 --> 50:06.254
Stay here where it's comfortable.
I'm the engineer.

50:08.173 --> 50:12.385
In here, he's the king.
Even the Captain respects him.

50:14.638 --> 50:18.558
This is the Taechang.
Patrol ship is making its rounds.

50:21.019 --> 50:23.772
This is the Junjin. Where exactly?

50:24.272 --> 50:27.275
What brings you all the way
to international waters?

50:28.109 --> 50:29.194
International waters?

50:29.277 --> 50:34.699
What's wrong, Junjin?
Catch some endangered fish?

50:43.875 --> 50:45.460
Get ready to fish.

50:45.585 --> 50:49.172
Cover the fish hold with the net.

50:49.256 --> 50:50.966
Hurry! Wan-ho, hide inside.

50:51.841 --> 50:54.135
Stay absolutely still,
and don't make a sound!

51:09.859 --> 51:13.822
- Will they be okay in there?
- It'll be fine. Act natural.

51:16.992 --> 51:18.243
Junjin!

51:19.119 --> 51:20.537
Turn off your engine, hah?

51:22.372 --> 51:25.458
Bring me closer to the boat.

51:35.844 --> 51:38.847
I know these guys well,
so wait over there.

51:41.391 --> 51:42.976
Don't just stand around.

51:48.356 --> 51:53.111
You look younger every time.
What's wrong with your hair?

51:55.530 --> 51:56.906
And you must be new.

52:02.203 --> 52:03.705
Wan-ho!

52:05.040 --> 52:06.916
Still hiding from debt collectors?

52:08.126 --> 52:09.461
Come out!

52:22.932 --> 52:25.352
Get up.

52:25.727 --> 52:29.397
- Dick caught in the net, huh?
- What are you doing?

52:29.564 --> 52:33.485
What did you catch?
Covering it all up.

52:33.610 --> 52:36.529
We didn't catch shit.
We haven't even started.

52:37.864 --> 52:40.075
Why are you sitting out
in this cold?

52:40.784 --> 52:42.911
Let's go upstairs.

52:43.328 --> 52:47.082
I'm busy today so let's have
a quick drink out here.

52:49.876 --> 52:51.586
What are you, the Mafia?

52:52.087 --> 52:53.922
Why are you standing around?

52:55.423 --> 52:57.634
Dong-sik, go get the
leftover sashimi.

52:57.801 --> 52:58.927
Get ready to cast the net.

52:59.344 --> 53:03.139
I have something to discuss
with Chief Kim.

53:07.811 --> 53:12.565
Measuring my mesh size?
Getting strict on me now?

53:13.358 --> 53:16.111
Can't help it.
This is bureaucracy.

53:17.112 --> 53:20.407
My men are watching.
I have to do it right.

53:22.033 --> 53:25.120
- You can go now.
- Yes, Captain.

53:26.162 --> 53:29.124
Seems like the mesh is
a little too small.

53:30.625 --> 53:34.671
It would have been nicer
on the bridge.

53:46.307 --> 53:48.643
So sweet.

53:48.977 --> 53:50.520
This is the perk of being
a fisherman.

53:54.399 --> 53:55.525
What was that?

53:58.653 --> 54:01.656
Wait... Did you hear that?

54:04.701 --> 54:06.035
Is it coming from below?

54:07.787 --> 54:10.290
Is Wan-ho fixing something again?

54:11.666 --> 54:13.918
Oh... Wan-ho!

54:15.962 --> 54:17.589
He's fixing the radiator, sir.

54:17.797 --> 54:21.134
It's an old boat.
The radiator is rusty.

54:21.509 --> 54:22.594
Radiator?

54:22.927 --> 54:24.971
It keeps breaking down.

54:25.346 --> 54:26.556
Shit.

54:29.058 --> 54:31.561
You won't find anything on
an old boat.

54:31.686 --> 54:33.897
So go catch the big fish.

54:37.692 --> 54:40.528
What time is it? Let me see.

54:41.279 --> 54:44.741
Heard these are quite popular
in Yeosu nowadays.

54:45.366 --> 54:46.743
What are you talking about?

54:47.202 --> 54:48.244
Come on.

54:48.870 --> 54:53.917
Think you can fish these
without cutting me in?

54:54.876 --> 54:59.172
I'm a sailor too. Need to make
a living out in the sea.

54:59.214 --> 55:02.842
I've no idea what you're saying.
We'll miss the fish.

55:03.259 --> 55:06.012
You should go.
We have to start working.

55:06.054 --> 55:07.555
Damn it.

55:07.889 --> 55:11.476
Do you want me to open this
to make my point?

55:12.560 --> 55:13.937
What the hell are you doing?

55:14.854 --> 55:18.066
If you're really a sailor, mind your
freakin' manners on my boat.

55:18.358 --> 55:20.902
Who the hell are you?
Threatening to open my fish hold.

55:20.944 --> 55:22.695
Get down here!

55:22.904 --> 55:25.365
Open it! It'll be your grave!

55:33.081 --> 55:35.250
Such a temper.

55:36.251 --> 55:39.295
Let's not do this
in front of the boys.

55:45.301 --> 55:46.761
Asshole.

55:50.890 --> 55:52.892
See you at Yeo's office.

55:55.103 --> 55:55.979
I'm leaving.

55:57.564 --> 55:58.523
Hey!

55:58.773 --> 56:00.441
Hey! He's leaving!

56:01.609 --> 56:04.112
Looks like a sea fog is
creeping in!

56:07.949 --> 56:10.618
See you back on the golden shore!

56:13.788 --> 56:15.456
Sea fog my ass.

56:24.465 --> 56:26.259
Kyung-koo! Put this away.

56:26.301 --> 56:28.136
- Open the hatch.
- Yes, sir.

56:34.100 --> 56:35.643
What are you waiting for?

56:38.730 --> 56:41.024
Are they asleep?

56:42.525 --> 56:45.528
Must be sleeping.
Guess they got used to it here.

56:46.404 --> 56:48.656
Sleeping on top of each other,
not minding the smell anymore.

56:56.581 --> 56:57.749
Are you okay?

56:58.791 --> 56:59.626
Hey!

57:01.252 --> 57:02.003
Hey?

57:08.968 --> 57:10.511
Get up.

57:11.888 --> 57:13.890
Come on. Get up!

57:15.183 --> 57:17.727
Anybody awake?

57:23.107 --> 57:25.276
Get out. The gas leaked.

57:25.360 --> 57:28.029
- Gas?
- Don't breathe!

57:28.738 --> 57:31.741
Dong-sik, come out. Come out!

57:32.659 --> 57:34.953
- Don't close the hatch.
- What's wrong?

57:35.244 --> 57:36.454
He says the gas leaked.

57:36.621 --> 57:38.456
Shit. Wan-ho!

57:39.207 --> 57:40.208
Wan-ho!

57:52.845 --> 57:54.847
- What happened?
- What is it?

57:59.060 --> 58:00.520
It's Freon gas.

58:01.229 --> 58:03.731
The freezer must've exploded.

58:04.983 --> 58:07.318
- They're all dead...
- Look!

58:07.527 --> 58:11.280
He just moved.
He's still alive, Captain.

58:20.081 --> 58:21.708
You guys, get back.

58:23.626 --> 58:24.919
Go away.

01:00:04.143 --> 01:00:04.977
Dong-sik.

01:00:05.603 --> 01:00:07.188
Open the hatch
and let the gas out.

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:12.985
Guys, get the ladder.
Go down there once it's clear.

01:00:13.486 --> 01:00:15.279
- Bos'n.
- Yes, Captain.

01:00:16.197 --> 01:00:18.199
Bring all the bodies
up to the deck.

01:00:19.784 --> 01:00:20.618
Sir?

01:00:21.577 --> 01:00:23.037
It's better...

01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:26.374
that they're all dead.

01:00:49.272 --> 01:00:50.064
Dong-sik.

01:00:51.149 --> 01:00:52.567
I think that's all of them.

01:00:52.733 --> 01:00:54.735
- Right?
- Yeah...

01:02:49.934 --> 01:02:50.935
Move!

01:02:53.354 --> 01:02:54.939
What are you doing?

01:02:55.022 --> 01:02:58.442
We have to draw the blood.
It'll attract the fish.

01:03:01.362 --> 01:03:04.907
Better to be fed to the fish than
be bloated corpses.

01:03:11.205 --> 01:03:15.418
If one of them washes up ashore,

01:03:16.043 --> 01:03:17.545
we're all finished.

01:03:18.045 --> 01:03:19.130
Got it?

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:23.426
Wan-ho, you want to be in prison
or with your daughter?

01:03:26.721 --> 01:03:28.222
You too, bos'n.

01:03:29.724 --> 01:03:31.017
Make sure it's done properly.

01:03:46.324 --> 01:03:47.783
Are we really doing this?

01:03:48.159 --> 01:03:49.577
We have no choice.

01:03:53.372 --> 01:03:57.001
It's the captain's orders.
We have to obey.

01:03:57.084 --> 01:03:58.711
- Here.
- That's right.

01:03:59.754 --> 01:04:01.005
Why're you standing around?

01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:03.174
You're in your work clothes,
aren't you?

01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:06.469
They're all dead.

01:04:07.386 --> 01:04:09.347
It's not like it's going to
hurt, right?

01:04:10.056 --> 01:04:11.432
Look, they're fine...

01:04:12.224 --> 01:04:15.269
They're dead anyway.

01:04:18.606 --> 01:04:19.815
We're doing them a favor.

01:04:27.365 --> 01:04:28.657
Wan-ho, don't just stand there.

01:04:29.992 --> 01:04:31.118
Dong-sik, you too.

01:04:34.163 --> 01:04:36.123
Dong-sik, you go in.

01:04:36.749 --> 01:04:40.252
He's just a kid, who went to
a marine science magnet.

01:04:41.462 --> 01:04:42.630
What the hell?

01:04:43.172 --> 01:04:48.636
He gets excused just cuz
he went to marine science high?

01:04:51.639 --> 01:04:53.724
- You fucking...
- Stop it!

01:04:54.058 --> 01:04:55.393
It's no time to fight.

01:04:56.602 --> 01:04:59.146
Dong-sik, get to it.
What's your problem?

01:04:59.271 --> 01:05:02.525
Goddamn it. Stop fighting
and get back to work!

01:05:03.776 --> 01:05:06.362
There's no time.
Look at all the bodies!

01:05:08.489 --> 01:05:11.951
See, chop the big ones up
into smaller pieces.

01:05:16.914 --> 01:05:19.166
Otherwise they might surface.
Got it?

01:05:26.882 --> 01:05:31.137
There was another girl
besides this woman.

01:05:31.637 --> 01:05:33.889
Chang-wook,
what are you mumbling about?

01:05:34.515 --> 01:05:37.017
Let's get to it.
We should hurry up.

01:05:37.059 --> 01:05:39.812
- That one's big.
- Look, like this.

01:05:41.856 --> 01:05:43.482
Look at him go. Not shy after all.

01:06:50.716 --> 01:06:52.593
With the small ones,
just draw blood and throw over.

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:57.431
Should be fine, right?

01:06:59.266 --> 01:07:01.977
The intestines are
spilling out of this one.

01:07:08.442 --> 01:07:12.655
What? I can't hear you.

01:07:14.448 --> 01:07:19.954
Yeah, that's what I meant.

01:07:22.831 --> 01:07:24.625
Here it is.

01:07:26.919 --> 01:07:28.546
What the hell are you
mumbling about?

01:07:31.298 --> 01:07:34.093
I'll let them know.

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:36.595
Really?

01:07:37.137 --> 01:07:40.808
Let's see. It's hot...

01:07:44.937 --> 01:07:46.772
Okay.

01:07:47.648 --> 01:07:51.151
I'll let them know.

01:08:10.838 --> 01:08:11.672
Is someone in here?

01:08:20.139 --> 01:08:21.055
Anyone?

01:08:24.184 --> 01:08:25.352
Kyung-koo!

01:08:25.853 --> 01:08:27.229
You have that girl, don't you?

01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:28.689
The little one

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.111
Turning silent cuz I'm here?

01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:45.372
I'll tell the bos'n.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.390
- Chang-wook!
- Holy shit!

01:09:04.433 --> 01:09:07.144
- Scared the shit out of me.
- What are you doing there?

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:08.645
Why?

01:09:08.854 --> 01:09:11.523
Hurry up. The bos'n called
a meeting.

01:09:12.483 --> 01:09:13.359
Come on.

01:09:16.028 --> 01:09:17.696
Son of a bitch.

01:09:17.946 --> 01:09:19.740
Creeping up on me.

01:09:23.202 --> 01:09:24.578
Don't push.

01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:33.420
- Hold still.
- You asshole!

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:34.630
Don't move.

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:37.591
Kyung-koo, did you see
that young chick?

01:09:37.675 --> 01:09:39.635
How the hell should I know?

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:42.261
- Should've had that woman.
- What're you saying?

01:09:43.305 --> 01:09:45.307
You had her,
but I never got my turn.

01:09:45.933 --> 01:09:48.185
Out of your minds? What the hell?!

01:09:49.103 --> 01:09:49.978
Get your shit together.

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:52.189
Listen up.

01:09:53.023 --> 01:09:54.650
Nothing happened on
this boat today.

01:09:54.692 --> 01:09:56.402
- No, no!
- What?

01:09:58.278 --> 01:10:00.698
We can keep this a secret for
the rest of our life, right?

01:10:02.116 --> 01:10:04.451
To be honest, why should we care?

01:10:04.785 --> 01:10:07.621
Captain ordered the smuggling
and chopping the bodies.

01:10:07.705 --> 01:10:08.330
What?

01:10:08.455 --> 01:10:11.458
If I tell the police,
the captain goes to prison.

01:10:19.758 --> 01:10:23.303
What the fuck is wrong
with everyone?

01:10:27.516 --> 01:10:30.811
We're all in the same boat.

01:10:30.853 --> 01:10:33.522
It's literally a boat.
We're all in it!

01:10:33.856 --> 01:10:35.816
- Bos'n.
- What?

01:10:36.567 --> 01:10:39.737
Once the fog clears,
we're heading for shore, right?

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.531
That's right. Then it's all over.

01:10:54.752 --> 01:10:55.669
Hong-mae.

01:10:55.878 --> 01:10:59.339
I know... It's your last wish.

01:10:59.506 --> 01:11:01.008
Wan-ho?

01:11:05.554 --> 01:11:08.724
Stop doing this to me.

01:11:09.683 --> 01:11:12.895
I should've listened.

01:11:13.771 --> 01:11:14.646
Watch your head!

01:11:16.231 --> 01:11:21.570
It's so hot. They're burning.

01:11:22.029 --> 01:11:23.071
Wan-ho, are you okay?

01:11:32.706 --> 01:11:33.540
Hong-mae.

01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:35.334
You can come out now.

01:11:37.127 --> 01:11:40.631
I brought real ramen,
the pangahme for you.

01:11:49.848 --> 01:11:53.060
- We didn't have hot pepper.
- Will you kill me too?

01:11:53.644 --> 01:11:54.394
What?

01:11:57.064 --> 01:11:58.565
I saw everything.

01:11:59.858 --> 01:12:00.859
What are you talking about?

01:12:01.735 --> 01:12:03.529
It's not what you think.

01:12:03.529 --> 01:12:04.905
Don't come near me.

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:07.074
You have to be quiet.

01:12:07.115 --> 01:12:08.951
Yeah, I know.
Take your filthy hands off me.

01:12:09.535 --> 01:12:13.247
- Where are you going?
- Have to go home.

01:12:13.247 --> 01:12:15.040
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

01:12:15.082 --> 01:12:15.916
Wan-ho!

01:12:17.584 --> 01:12:19.461
- Okay, I got it.
- Wan-ho!

01:12:20.337 --> 01:12:21.797
Come down from there.

01:12:21.839 --> 01:12:22.548
What?

01:12:22.631 --> 01:12:24.591
It's scary up there.

01:12:25.133 --> 01:12:26.260
Wan-ho, what are you doing?

01:12:28.136 --> 01:12:30.597
My god, you were right.

01:12:31.265 --> 01:12:34.017
It must have been so hot.

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.436
What are you doing with
dead people's belongings?

01:12:41.942 --> 01:12:43.569
Look. Here it is.

01:12:44.194 --> 01:12:45.612
Why did you take that out?

01:12:46.905 --> 01:12:51.869
We have to burn it.
Why'd you fucking take it out?

01:12:55.956 --> 01:12:57.124
This man...

01:12:58.292 --> 01:13:01.086
wants me to tell his family
where he is.

01:13:05.632 --> 01:13:10.137
I should take this
to the police station, right?

01:13:10.178 --> 01:13:13.557
What? Are you saying
you'll turn us in?

01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:16.476
We need to ask the police
for his address.

01:13:16.727 --> 01:13:19.688
Forget the police.
This was an accident!

01:13:19.897 --> 01:13:23.567
It's cuz the boat was so old!
You know that too!

01:13:26.695 --> 01:13:28.322
Kang Chul-joo...

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:32.159
Let's just stop.

01:13:35.495 --> 01:13:37.831
It's all my fault.

01:13:41.168 --> 01:13:42.169
Wan-ho.

01:13:42.711 --> 01:13:44.588
Where are you going?

01:13:45.672 --> 01:13:47.174
Let's talk about this.

01:13:47.633 --> 01:13:50.552
- Talk about what?
- Let's talk over a drink.

01:13:50.719 --> 01:13:55.724
Where's the bottle of soju
you stashed away?

01:13:59.186 --> 01:14:03.190
They're already dead.
What's the use!

01:14:04.524 --> 01:14:06.151
Let's have a drink together.

01:14:06.193 --> 01:14:08.153
What we did today.

01:14:09.029 --> 01:14:13.533
Can't keep it just
in our heads forever.

01:14:22.209 --> 01:14:23.794
Poor thing.

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:29.007
I'm sorry...

01:14:33.679 --> 01:14:36.098
I'll send them the news.

01:14:37.349 --> 01:14:39.393
Rest in peace.

01:14:45.565 --> 01:14:47.401
I'll follow soon...

01:18:38.131 --> 01:18:40.383
Even if I lose my life...

01:18:41.968 --> 01:18:44.429
I'm taking you to the shore.

01:18:48.308 --> 01:18:50.268
We're going to Guro 3-dong.

01:19:00.487 --> 01:19:02.739
Kyung-koo, shine it my way!

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:06.534
The sun is up.
Can't even see in broad daylight.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.161
You!

01:19:08.161 --> 01:19:09.329
Where have you been?

01:19:10.622 --> 01:19:11.957
Wan-ho's not
in the engine room, right?

01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:14.918
Shit. Where the hell is he?

01:19:15.502 --> 01:19:16.169
Kyung-koo!

01:19:16.419 --> 01:19:17.963
- Yes, sir.
- Shine it that way!

01:19:18.088 --> 01:19:21.341
It's no use.
We can't see anything.

01:19:21.466 --> 01:19:23.718
I definitely heard it.
Someone fell in the sea.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.512
- Wan-ho!
- Did you hear anything?

01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:31.893
Wan-ho's been acting strange
since yesterday.

01:19:32.102 --> 01:19:34.521
Talking to himself and everything.

01:19:37.315 --> 01:19:38.525
Can't see a thing.

01:19:38.566 --> 01:19:39.317
Wan-ho!

01:19:39.693 --> 01:19:40.819
Wan-ho!

01:19:42.946 --> 01:19:44.489
Shit.

01:19:50.203 --> 01:19:52.080
Your new place.

01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:56.543
What are you doing here?

01:19:57.752 --> 01:19:59.212
Can't you see?

01:20:00.588 --> 01:20:03.383
Think they know
anything about the engine?

01:20:03.675 --> 01:20:05.176
I'm the only one.

01:20:06.094 --> 01:20:07.095
So...

01:20:07.178 --> 01:20:09.180
you're going to stay down
here now?

01:20:10.307 --> 01:20:13.351
What the hell are you doing
in the engine room?

01:20:17.731 --> 01:20:22.694
Isn't it weird that
Wan-ho just disappeared?

01:20:23.445 --> 01:20:26.072
Wan-ho? Don't remember
anyone like that.

01:20:26.906 --> 01:20:29.909
I'm the engineer now.

01:20:32.912 --> 01:20:34.456
What are you two doing here?

01:20:35.332 --> 01:20:36.708
You two dating?

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:38.752
Move over.

01:20:40.462 --> 01:20:43.923
I know Wan-ho used to stash his...

01:20:46.092 --> 01:20:47.010
Dong-sik.

01:20:47.469 --> 01:20:49.429
Don't dare tell anyone,
you asshole.

01:20:50.597 --> 01:20:53.016
You're keeping it all?

01:20:53.516 --> 01:20:54.934
Fuck off.

01:20:55.685 --> 01:20:59.397
You can be the engineer.
This is mine.

01:20:59.731 --> 01:21:02.650
Kyung-koo, hold on.
Let's split it in half.

01:21:03.068 --> 01:21:05.987
- Cut me off some.
- You idiot.

01:21:06.363 --> 01:21:09.407
Damn! That's supposed to be
my money!

01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:10.867
I'm the engineer.

01:21:11.618 --> 01:21:14.371
Do you think there's
anything else?

01:21:15.872 --> 01:21:17.207
What else would there be?

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:20.543
Should've looked for
the cash first.

01:21:21.002 --> 01:21:22.629
That could have been mine.

01:21:29.469 --> 01:21:30.970
Do you smell that?

01:21:32.138 --> 01:21:32.972
What?

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:39.270
Chang-wook.

01:21:39.938 --> 01:21:42.649
Don't you think Kyung-koo's
been acting weird?

01:21:43.108 --> 01:21:43.983
What about?

01:21:44.901 --> 01:21:47.737
He keeps taking stuff
and bringing it somewhere.

01:21:47.821 --> 01:21:50.031
Like now. He took the money
and went somewhere.

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:52.617
Like he's going to
see someone, a girl.

01:21:52.909 --> 01:21:55.912
- Girl?
- Let's follow him.

01:21:56.621 --> 01:21:58.706
Kyung-koo, that asshole.

01:22:01.543 --> 01:22:02.460
Chang-wook.

01:22:04.087 --> 01:22:04.879
Chang-wook!

01:22:06.464 --> 01:22:07.590
There she is!

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.431
Huh, nothing.

01:22:14.556 --> 01:22:18.059
There's nothing here.
Let's just go. Come on.

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:23.440
She's here! The girl, she's here!

01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:25.024
The girl is here!

01:22:25.150 --> 01:22:27.026
See? I told you!

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:29.696
Told you there's another girl.

01:22:31.156 --> 01:22:34.993
Yeah, she's the one.
The little one.

01:22:35.034 --> 01:22:38.204
Don't move. Stay right there.

01:22:38.204 --> 01:22:40.915
Chang-wook, come here.

01:22:43.918 --> 01:22:46.880
Let's keep her hidden.
We'll keep it a secret.

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:49.215
Between you and me.

01:22:49.382 --> 01:22:54.220
Fine, but she's mine. I found her.

01:22:54.387 --> 01:22:55.388
Also...

01:22:56.723 --> 01:22:58.558
imagine Kyung-koo finding her.

01:22:58.683 --> 01:22:59.893
No way!

01:23:00.059 --> 01:23:01.394
She's all mine.

01:23:01.478 --> 01:23:02.937
I'll be the only one havin' her.

01:23:05.732 --> 01:23:06.983
What now?

01:23:07.108 --> 01:23:10.236
Let's go up for now.
People will get suspicious.

01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:11.571
I want her now.

01:23:12.238 --> 01:23:14.032
She'll be here, right?

01:23:19.037 --> 01:23:21.164
Hurry up and get over here!

01:23:21.623 --> 01:23:24.709
What the hell were you doing?
You lazy asses.

01:23:24.751 --> 01:23:26.753
Chang-wook! You tend to the net.

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:27.962
Dong-sik! On that side.

01:23:27.962 --> 01:23:29.047
We're fishing?

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:31.424
- Dong-sik! Unwind anchor.
- Seriously?

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.262
What the hell's the point?
In a situation like this.

01:23:37.096 --> 01:23:40.099
What situation? Huh?

01:23:40.808 --> 01:23:44.896
Cast the net, catch fish,
then we go home.

01:23:44.938 --> 01:23:46.940
<i>Let go all lines!
Engine room get ready!</i>

01:23:47.649 --> 01:23:49.692
Engine room!

01:23:49.734 --> 01:23:52.278
<i>Turn on the generator
and get ready to cast the net.</i>

01:24:00.954 --> 01:24:02.372
Get the fuck off her!

01:24:03.122 --> 01:24:04.249
Dong-sik, please!

01:24:06.167 --> 01:24:09.921
Huh? "Dong-sik, please"?

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:16.052
You already did her, haven't you?

01:24:16.135 --> 01:24:18.096
You already did.

01:24:18.429 --> 01:24:21.808
She's fucking mine.
When did you do it?

01:24:22.642 --> 01:24:23.768
What are you two doing?

01:24:24.978 --> 01:24:27.897
Captain! He's hiding a girl.

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.192
He's been hiding her all along.

01:24:35.238 --> 01:24:36.030
Captain.

01:24:37.282 --> 01:24:39.450
She really doesn't know anything.

01:24:39.993 --> 01:24:42.078
She's been here the whole time.

01:24:45.456 --> 01:24:46.666
I don't know anything.

01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:50.211
What would I know?

01:24:52.839 --> 01:24:55.341
And... when we get to Yeosu,

01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:57.969
I'm going to make her my bride.

01:24:58.886 --> 01:25:00.513
We're going to get married.

01:25:02.515 --> 01:25:05.184
Even if she knows something,
I'm her husband.

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:09.105
She couldn't possibly tell
the police, right?

01:25:11.232 --> 01:25:13.693
So she did see something.

01:25:14.110 --> 01:25:16.696
Captain.
I'll be responsible for her.

01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:21.618
Stupid fuck. If she tells anyone,
we're doomed.

01:25:22.619 --> 01:25:23.536
No.

01:25:24.662 --> 01:25:25.288
Dong-sik!

01:25:25.330 --> 01:25:28.374
She's not your problem.
He's going to snitch on you!

01:25:28.416 --> 01:25:31.336
- You crazy asshole.
- Kyung-koo's going to snitch?

01:25:32.128 --> 01:25:34.005
Kyung-koo's part of
the Junjin crew.

01:25:34.631 --> 01:25:36.049
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir.

01:25:37.258 --> 01:25:39.052
Dong-sik, you're part of
the Junjin crew, right?

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:40.219
Yes, sir.

01:25:41.429 --> 01:25:42.555
What about her?

01:25:43.723 --> 01:25:44.891
What is she?

01:25:47.602 --> 01:25:49.145
- Dong-sik.
- What about Wan-ho?

01:25:52.023 --> 01:25:53.733
If we're all part of the crew,

01:25:54.192 --> 01:25:56.903
why did you kill him? Why?

01:25:59.155 --> 01:26:00.531
You must be out of your mind.

01:26:01.491 --> 01:26:02.575
Bos'n.

01:26:02.867 --> 01:26:04.535
Make sure she's
properly taken care of.

01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:06.788
So she doesn't float.

01:26:08.164 --> 01:26:10.249
- Dong-sik!
- What are you doing?!

01:26:10.875 --> 01:26:12.877
Kill me instead!

01:26:13.002 --> 01:26:14.587
- Dong-sik.
- Hong-mae!

01:26:15.004 --> 01:26:16.673
- Hong-mae!
- Dong-sik!

01:26:16.839 --> 01:26:19.300
Bos'n! This is murder!

01:26:19.676 --> 01:26:20.593
I know.

01:26:22.053 --> 01:26:23.721
- Hong-mae!
- Dong-sik.

01:26:23.763 --> 01:26:27.684
Get your shit together.
You don't even know her.

01:26:28.142 --> 01:26:30.812
Are you going to risk the crew,
our families,

01:26:30.895 --> 01:26:33.564
and the Junjin
just because of that girl?

01:26:33.898 --> 01:26:35.149
She's nothing!

01:26:35.191 --> 01:26:37.652
Captain...
I haven't done it with her yet.

01:26:37.777 --> 01:26:39.612
Can't kill her yet.

01:26:39.737 --> 01:26:41.406
- I'll be back.
- What the hell...?

01:26:45.868 --> 01:26:47.036
Hong-mae.

01:26:47.203 --> 01:26:48.287
Hong-mae!

01:26:50.748 --> 01:26:51.457
No!

01:26:51.624 --> 01:26:54.043
You freakin' bastard!

01:26:58.297 --> 01:26:59.382
Hong-mae!

01:27:00.133 --> 01:27:02.427
You bastard! Enough is enough!

01:27:02.468 --> 01:27:03.720
Where's Hong-mae?

01:27:31.998 --> 01:27:33.332
Where are you fuckers?

01:27:34.625 --> 01:27:35.501
Hong-mae!

01:27:37.003 --> 01:27:38.629
Where's Dong-sik?

01:27:38.963 --> 01:27:41.883
Son of a bitch.
Hit the same place twice?

01:27:43.968 --> 01:27:45.887
Where's Dong-sik? Did you get him?

01:27:45.928 --> 01:27:47.138
Captain, Hong-mae went...

01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:49.098
- What?
- No... Shit!

01:27:49.223 --> 01:27:50.933
Son of a bitch lost his mind.

01:27:51.684 --> 01:27:52.560
Kyung-koo!

01:27:55.521 --> 01:27:56.981
Shit... Bos'n!

01:27:57.064 --> 01:27:58.191
<i>The bridge!</i>

01:28:00.485 --> 01:28:02.028
Coast Guard!
Junjin to Coast Guard!

01:28:02.028 --> 01:28:03.196
What are you doing?!

01:28:03.279 --> 01:28:04.822
- Door's locked!
- 127 degrees east,

01:28:04.864 --> 01:28:05.782
33 degrees north.

01:28:05.823 --> 01:28:06.699
Out of the way!

01:28:07.658 --> 01:28:09.744
Did you copy?
Junjin to Coast Guard!

01:28:09.786 --> 01:28:12.121
This is the Junjin!
127 degrees east...

01:28:14.624 --> 01:28:16.709
You ungrateful piece of shit.

01:28:17.251 --> 01:28:18.169
Get him out.

01:28:18.419 --> 01:28:20.046
Come here, you son of a bitch.

01:28:20.087 --> 01:28:22.298
Where's Hong-mae?
You know where she is, right?

01:28:22.548 --> 01:28:23.466
Let me go.

01:28:23.549 --> 01:28:25.718
<i>Coast Guard to Junjin!</i>

01:28:25.802 --> 01:28:27.553
- Coast Guard can't do shit.
<i>- Have you hit a reef?</i>

01:28:27.637 --> 01:28:29.722
<i>Calling nearby vessels
to the rescue!</i>

01:28:29.764 --> 01:28:31.474
Coordinates are useless
in a sea fog.

01:28:31.516 --> 01:28:32.850
<i>127 degrees...</i>

01:28:33.810 --> 01:28:35.061
Get inside.

01:28:35.937 --> 01:28:37.980
In there, you piece of shit.

01:28:40.107 --> 01:28:42.902
Kyung-koo, I'll find the girl.
Stay here.

01:28:43.986 --> 01:28:45.196
Look closely.

01:28:46.239 --> 01:28:47.990
Dong-sik, you stay put!

01:28:49.826 --> 01:28:52.078
<i>Coast Guard patrol is on its way!</i>

01:28:52.245 --> 01:28:55.081
<i>Junjin, there are a lot of freighters
in your area.</i>

01:28:55.248 --> 01:28:57.917
<i>It's dangerous cuz of the sea fog,
so stop your engine and wait.</i>

01:29:10.012 --> 01:29:10.930
Hong-mae!

01:29:12.139 --> 01:29:13.099
Hong-mae...

01:29:15.101 --> 01:29:16.227
Hong-mae.

01:29:17.562 --> 01:29:19.105
It's me, Dong-sik.

01:29:19.605 --> 01:29:21.941
I'm sorry. So sorry.

01:29:28.322 --> 01:29:29.448
I have to go home.

01:29:33.369 --> 01:29:34.954
I need to go home...

01:29:34.996 --> 01:29:36.789
We will. We'll go home.

01:29:37.123 --> 01:29:38.457
We'll go home together.

01:29:39.166 --> 01:29:40.793
Coast Guard will be here soon.

01:29:41.127 --> 01:29:43.045
Just hang on for a bit.

01:29:43.379 --> 01:29:44.797
Hong-mae...

01:29:45.715 --> 01:29:47.425
I hate it here.

01:29:49.343 --> 01:29:52.638
There, there. You're with me now.

01:29:55.641 --> 01:29:57.143
Hong-mae's in here, right?

01:29:57.602 --> 01:29:59.645
Couldn't find her anywhere else.

01:30:06.319 --> 01:30:07.904
Did you do it with her again?

01:30:09.071 --> 01:30:10.323
Did you?

01:30:10.364 --> 01:30:13.993
Look at our little Dong-sik.
You're scary.

01:30:14.118 --> 01:30:15.286
You were doing her, weren't you?

01:30:17.455 --> 01:30:18.623
What the fuck?

01:30:18.664 --> 01:30:19.665
How many times, huh?

01:30:19.874 --> 01:30:22.793
Hong-mae, Hong-mae!

01:30:23.169 --> 01:30:24.670
You little...

01:30:24.837 --> 01:30:27.965
Now that you're up close,
your skin is so fair...

01:30:30.509 --> 01:30:31.552
You!

01:30:31.636 --> 01:30:32.803
You again!

01:30:32.887 --> 01:30:36.515
You! Trying to do it
all by yourself again!

01:30:36.641 --> 01:30:39.602
I didn't even get to do it.
You two already took turns.

01:30:42.104 --> 01:30:43.814
Are you okay?

01:30:44.357 --> 01:30:45.399
Hong-mae, you okay?

01:30:47.193 --> 01:30:50.363
Let's do it here.
Gosh, it smells in here.

01:31:26.732 --> 01:31:27.566
Hong-mae.

01:31:27.984 --> 01:31:30.069
<i>Hong-mae!</i>

01:31:30.778 --> 01:31:32.405
<i>Where are you taking her?</i>

01:31:51.882 --> 01:31:55.553
Wait here. I'll take care of
everything from here.

01:31:56.262 --> 01:31:57.763
You're not going anywhere, right?

01:31:59.223 --> 01:32:00.558
I'm not going anywhere.

01:32:32.506 --> 01:32:33.799
That son of a bitch.

01:32:34.967 --> 01:32:36.844
Completely broke the engine.

01:32:39.472 --> 01:32:40.639
Dong-sik.

01:32:42.308 --> 01:32:44.101
If the Coast Guard finds us...

01:32:44.685 --> 01:32:47.980
we all go to prison and
she gets deported.

01:32:48.689 --> 01:32:49.565
Deported.

01:32:51.484 --> 01:32:52.485
Got it?

01:32:53.569 --> 01:32:55.154
If we shut her up...

01:32:58.365 --> 01:33:00.993
Lay a hand on her and
I'll kill you first!

01:33:06.373 --> 01:33:09.543
You son of a bitch,
do you really want to die?

01:33:40.282 --> 01:33:41.283
You damn bitch.

01:33:48.124 --> 01:33:49.750
What are you?

01:33:51.001 --> 01:33:52.211
What the hell are you?

01:33:52.795 --> 01:33:54.630
Are you a person or a witch?

01:33:57.716 --> 01:33:58.843
What the hell?

01:34:00.344 --> 01:34:01.637
There's a hole?

01:34:11.689 --> 01:34:12.731
Get up.

01:34:15.484 --> 01:34:18.028
Shit! The ship's leaking!

01:34:18.487 --> 01:34:21.407
Kyung-koo! Chang-wook!

01:34:25.035 --> 01:34:26.120
Shit!

01:34:30.332 --> 01:34:31.417
Stop right there!

01:34:33.627 --> 01:34:34.670
Dong-sik!

01:34:41.802 --> 01:34:43.596
Dong-sik! Hurry!

01:35:23.385 --> 01:35:24.511
Ho-young!

01:35:24.511 --> 01:35:25.971
Hong-mae!

01:35:26.013 --> 01:35:29.266
We have to untie this
to use the buoy.

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:42.571
<i>Help! Help!</i>

01:35:42.988 --> 01:35:43.989
Who is that?

01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:49.745
Chang-wook, is that you?

01:35:49.787 --> 01:35:51.664
Yes! Captain!

01:35:51.789 --> 01:35:53.499
Captain, the ladder! The ladder!

01:35:55.459 --> 01:35:56.502
Who is that?

01:35:58.337 --> 01:35:59.380
Kyung-koo!

01:36:07.179 --> 01:36:08.806
Go to the engine room.

01:36:08.847 --> 01:36:11.767
The hull is punctured,
so go and plug the hole.

01:36:12.518 --> 01:36:15.312
- Or the boat may sink.
- Lot of holes here too.

01:36:15.688 --> 01:36:17.356
Did we hit something?

01:36:19.108 --> 01:36:21.819
Captain! The girl! Don't kill her!

01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:23.070
Plug the hole!

01:36:24.822 --> 01:36:25.990
Useless fools.

01:36:26.031 --> 01:36:28.200
I'm the only one
who hasn't done it yet!

01:36:30.869 --> 01:36:32.705
She's mine!

01:36:44.591 --> 01:36:45.843
Bos'n!

01:36:48.637 --> 01:36:50.639
Where'd you all go?

01:36:51.849 --> 01:36:53.100
Dong-sik!

01:36:55.185 --> 01:36:56.895
We have to save the ship.

01:36:58.063 --> 01:37:00.983
<i>I can't stop the leak. Let me out.</i>

01:37:03.986 --> 01:37:05.237
I'm scared!

01:37:12.286 --> 01:37:14.288
- Dong-sik, you bastard!
- Go up.

01:37:14.371 --> 01:37:16.874
What are you doing?
The boat is about to sink!

01:37:18.250 --> 01:37:19.752
You crazy son of a bitch.

01:37:20.085 --> 01:37:21.879
I'll throw that bitch.

01:37:22.212 --> 01:37:24.089
Throw her in the ocean. Come here!

01:37:26.008 --> 01:37:27.760
- Let me go!
- Don't touch her!

01:37:29.136 --> 01:37:31.597
- You've gone insane!
- I'll kill you!

01:37:32.181 --> 01:37:33.265
Dong-sik!

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:36.185
I'm the captain of this boat!

01:37:37.144 --> 01:37:38.187
We have to...

01:37:38.312 --> 01:37:41.231
at least save the boat.
Come on, Dong-sik.

01:37:44.193 --> 01:37:47.696
You're no captain.
You are a murderer.

01:37:47.863 --> 01:37:48.864
Murderer!

01:37:59.291 --> 01:38:03.170
Let's throw the anchor in
the water together.

01:38:03.337 --> 01:38:06.340
Wake up. Our boat is done for!

01:38:16.016 --> 01:38:18.519
<i>This is the Coast Guard patrol!</i>

01:38:19.144 --> 01:38:21.647
<i>Junjin, we have poor visibility!</i>

01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:23.482
<i>Sound your horn!</i>

01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:26.068
Dong-sik, it's the Coast Guard.

01:38:27.486 --> 01:38:29.279
- Hong-mae.
<i>- Junjin! Junjin vessel!</i>

01:38:29.321 --> 01:38:31.031
It's time to go home.

01:38:31.198 --> 01:38:32.866
<i>Sound your horn!</i>

01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:35.994
<i>Junjin!</i>

01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:38.330
<i>Sound your damn horn!</i>

01:38:38.789 --> 01:38:40.707
<i>We can't see you!</i>

01:38:41.834 --> 01:38:43.335
<i>Sound your horn!</i>

01:39:33.969 --> 01:39:35.429
We have to throw all this
over board.

01:39:36.638 --> 01:39:40.017
It's too heavy.
It'll sink the boat.

01:39:40.309 --> 01:39:44.062
Guys, the boat...

01:39:44.938 --> 01:39:47.065
We can save the boat.

01:42:13.211 --> 01:42:14.338
Dong-sik...

01:42:17.716 --> 01:42:18.842
Dong-sik.

01:42:20.469 --> 01:42:21.720
Dong-sik!

01:42:27.893 --> 01:42:29.895
We have to go home...

01:42:32.064 --> 01:42:33.023
Go home...

01:42:50.499 --> 01:42:51.667
It's okay.

01:42:58.382 --> 01:42:59.424
Hong-mae.

01:43:08.016 --> 01:43:09.184
Dong-sik.

01:43:11.728 --> 01:43:13.105
Thank you...

01:44:41.526 --> 01:44:46.031
<i>6 years later</i>

01:45:14.392 --> 01:45:15.352
Hey, Kim!

01:45:15.936 --> 01:45:17.687
How about some pork barbeque
with soju?

01:45:20.065 --> 01:45:23.026
- What about Guro-dong Dongpo pork?
- Dongpo pork?

01:45:23.151 --> 01:45:25.821
- Where?
- Where we went last week.

01:45:26.238 --> 01:45:27.739
Nah, it wasn't good.

01:45:28.949 --> 01:45:32.953
Let's go. Pork barbecue or
Dongpo pork, whichever.

01:46:18.623 --> 01:46:19.916
What would you like?

01:46:21.585 --> 01:46:23.879
Ramen with rice cake.

01:46:29.384 --> 01:46:31.177
One ramen with rice cake!

01:46:31.344 --> 01:46:32.012
Got it!

01:46:33.138 --> 01:46:36.266
Ma'am. Do you have hot pepper?

01:46:36.349 --> 01:46:38.643
- For the ramen?
- Yes, please.

01:46:39.269 --> 01:46:40.645
Can you chop one up for me?
