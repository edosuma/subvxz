03:46.050 --> 03:47.415
Interesting.

03:47.785 --> 03:50.720
But I can see a trained animal
at the circus.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.018
Gargantua is not just a trained animal.

03:54.359 --> 03:58.523
He has been programmed to help us.
Any way I want him to.

03:58.596 --> 04:02.123
Don't you think this is something
the high command will be interested in?

04:02.200 --> 04:03.189
Possibly.

04:03.268 --> 04:06.261
A giant gorilla, especially trained.

04:06.405 --> 04:09.636
Interesting.
But what do you get out of it, Erica?

04:09.775 --> 04:13.142
If I can prove that my work
is important to the war effort...

04:13.245 --> 04:17.305
then there will be more money
for my research. Isn't this true?

04:17.382 --> 04:20.910
I'll radio my superiors
and see what they have to say.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.976
Please don't stand too close, folks.
Gargantua is not your ordinary ape.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.779
He's not only the most ferocious ape
ever kept in captivity...

05:23.850 --> 05:26.149
he's also the most intelligent...

05:26.754 --> 05:29.552
and the closest thing to a man
any of you will ever see.

05:29.624 --> 05:30.750
Look at his face.

05:30.825 --> 05:33.487
You can see the same emotions
most humans have:

05:33.561 --> 05:35.961
Anger, desire, fear.

05:36.030 --> 05:37.827
When scientists examined Gargantua...

05:37.898 --> 05:41.459
they said he could be one of
the missing links between animals and us.

05:42.336 --> 05:45.669
A great, big ape
who walks and thinks like a man.

05:59.220 --> 06:01.245
Yes, Hans. I understand.

06:01.722 --> 06:04.555
And I assure you,
you have nothing to worry about.

06:07.462 --> 06:11.296
I've told you. I've taken the Pavlovian
conditioning-response theory...

06:11.366 --> 06:15.700
and perfected it to a degree
no one ever has thought possible.

06:16.405 --> 06:18.430
I have complete control over him.

06:25.147 --> 06:26.273
Hi, Fred.

06:26.615 --> 06:29.448
You lucked out. I'm gonna spell you
for the rest of the shift.

06:29.518 --> 06:33.010
Great. It's hard enough giving that spiel
with a straight face.

06:33.088 --> 06:36.615
The goggly-eyed look on everyone's faces
is enough to drive me wild.

06:36.692 --> 06:39.024
Besides, that thing gives me the creeps.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.927
After you have a couple of beers,
you'll forget all about it.

06:41.997 --> 06:43.862
I'm gonna give it a good try.

06:49.939 --> 06:51.304
Guard.

06:51.708 --> 06:53.767
- I have an assignment.
- Good.

06:54.077 --> 06:55.806
It's really two missions.

06:56.112 --> 06:59.570
First, we must recapture
one of our most important agents...

06:59.649 --> 07:01.810
who has fallen into American hands.

07:01.884 --> 07:06.184
And secondly,
if Wonder Woman should interfere...

07:06.756 --> 07:08.246
we must dispose of her.

07:11.394 --> 07:12.827
That is to say...

07:13.396 --> 07:15.591
Gargantua must dispose of her.

07:16.132 --> 07:18.293
Our contact is Hans Ackler.

07:18.501 --> 07:21.197
Good. I'm looking forward
to working with Col. Ackler again.

07:21.270 --> 07:23.738
We will leave with Gargantua this evening.

07:23.806 --> 07:27.299
Then we will rendezvous with Hans
at a place he has selected...

07:27.377 --> 07:29.845
and then we will prepare for our mission.

07:47.531 --> 07:49.658
Okay, Steigler, go on. Where else?

07:50.100 --> 07:53.035
There's another location
at 12th and M Streets...

07:53.103 --> 07:55.333
another at Potomac Parkway...

07:56.273 --> 07:59.436
Mr. Steigler
certainly does have a lot of information.

07:59.510 --> 08:02.138
Yes, he does.
He's the most important enemy agent...

08:02.212 --> 08:04.374
to come over to our side
since the war began.

08:04.449 --> 08:07.475
Then the information he gives us
could save a lot of lives.

08:07.552 --> 08:10.521
If it's true. There's always the chance
he's a double agent...

08:10.588 --> 08:13.989
feeding us false information
and hoping we'll act on it.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.993
The information he's given us so far
has checked out.

08:17.629 --> 08:21.292
If it continues to check out,
and he really has defected...

08:21.666 --> 08:24.760
you can bet the Nazis will do
anything they can to get him back...

08:24.836 --> 08:26.326
dead or alive.

08:26.404 --> 08:30.238
They wouldn't kill him.
They'd have to find out what he's told us.

08:33.111 --> 08:34.806
What about my protection?

08:36.481 --> 08:39.347
Don't worry,
nothing's going to happen to you.

08:40.150 --> 08:42.176
I don't blame him for being nervous.

08:42.253 --> 08:46.020
He knows what will happen to him
if the Nazis get their hands on him.

08:47.393 --> 08:50.988
- Did you hear everything?
- Yes. He's gonna be very valuable to us.

08:51.063 --> 08:52.792
I don't want anything to happen to him.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.026
We're moving him
to our top-security quarters...

08:55.100 --> 08:57.034
- after this session.
- Good.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.161
How long does a full interrogation take?

08:59.238 --> 09:00.899
Could be weeks, Diana.

09:00.973 --> 09:03.203
We want to find out everything he knows.

09:17.590 --> 09:20.218
Erica, how good to see you again.

09:20.459 --> 09:22.290
And you, too, Gargantua.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.558
Yes, Carl.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.131
I have located Steigler.

09:28.735 --> 09:29.895
Where?

09:30.370 --> 09:33.567
American intelligence has converted
an old apartment building...

09:33.640 --> 09:35.699
for their top-secret personnel.

09:36.543 --> 09:39.011
He is being held on the fourth floor.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.513
- How tight is their security?
- Very tight.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.311
The street is blocked off,
all the entrances are guarded...

09:44.384 --> 09:46.409
and there are also guards on every floor.

09:46.486 --> 09:49.216
Fourth floor, Hans,
that's going to be tough.

09:49.422 --> 09:53.256
Why do we have to get him out alive?
Why don't we just kill him?

09:53.326 --> 09:55.851
Because American intelligence
has been questioning him...

09:55.929 --> 09:57.419
getting information.

09:57.497 --> 10:00.295
Berlin wants to know
how much he has told them.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.834
Gentlemen...

10:01.902 --> 10:04.872
I assure you,
Gargantua will solve all your problems.

10:24.425 --> 10:26.757
I told you before,
you have nothing to worry about.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.522
You're well guarded, I assure you.

10:28.596 --> 10:31.759
You underestimate them. They know
everything. I've worked with them.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.527
They have ways of getting to anyone.

10:33.601 --> 10:36.536
Here. See this?
I've just had this installed.

10:37.038 --> 10:41.202
If there is an emergency,
this button will alert the M.P. S on guard.

10:41.575 --> 10:42.838
Good.

10:43.278 --> 10:46.475
- I'll see you tomorrow, at the same time?
- Yes. Tomorrow.

10:47.349 --> 10:49.214
Come with me, soldier.

11:33.062 --> 11:37.726
- Sorry, sir, you can't go any further.
- Just stay still. No fast moves. Move!

13:06.024 --> 13:10.256
I'd hate to have that ape after me.
He just can't wait to tear somebody apart.

13:19.771 --> 13:23.606
Carl is right. How can you be sure
he will not harm Steigler?

13:23.976 --> 13:25.000
He won't.

13:25.077 --> 13:28.535
He must bring Steigler back alive.
Those are my orders!

13:28.681 --> 13:30.672
Gargantua won't harm Steigler.

13:30.916 --> 13:34.443
He's only been programmed
to bring him back to us. Alive.

15:02.009 --> 15:03.977
Look, he's got Steigler.

15:36.178 --> 15:38.976
Congratulations! Now, to the truck.

15:54.663 --> 15:58.224
So far, so good.
Half our mission is accomplished.

16:18.187 --> 16:21.179
Now we contact the U-boat,
and soon a smooth trip home.

16:21.257 --> 16:22.952
Home? Berlin?

16:23.026 --> 16:26.985
You didn't think we'd let you stay
in America too long, did you?

16:51.955 --> 16:55.049
- They got Steigler.
- The sergeant.

16:55.392 --> 16:58.850
- Maybe he can tell us what's happened.
- Sergeant, where's Steigler?

16:58.929 --> 17:01.295
The alarm sounded.

17:02.933 --> 17:04.263
I came up.

17:05.636 --> 17:08.605
A gorilla attacked me.

17:09.673 --> 17:12.767
A gorilla?
Come on, Sergeant, no time for lies.

17:13.010 --> 17:15.535
Steve, he's been very badly frightened.

17:15.612 --> 17:18.911
He may be exaggerating,
but I don't think he's lying.

17:20.652 --> 17:21.983
A gorilla?

17:25.924 --> 17:28.358
Well, somehow, someone got Steigler.

17:35.166 --> 17:39.694
You've engineered my escape. I'm grateful.
I can get back to my assignment now.

17:39.771 --> 17:42.569
- Berlin wants to talk to you.
- Why?

17:42.640 --> 17:44.540
My orders are to bring you back.

17:44.609 --> 17:47.009
I didn't tell them anything,
if that's what you think.

17:47.078 --> 17:50.275
I don't think anything.
I'm just following orders.

17:50.648 --> 17:53.344
- You established contact?
- Yes, I have the submarine now.

17:53.418 --> 17:57.514
Good. Tell them we are ready
to be picked up. Make the arrangements.

17:57.589 --> 18:01.526
Wait! We have Steigler.
We have accomplished our mission.

18:03.095 --> 18:07.498
But with a little initiative on our part,
we could do so much more.

18:08.267 --> 18:12.761
We could dazzle the high command with
a success beyond their wildest dreams.

18:13.139 --> 18:14.197
Such as?

18:14.273 --> 18:17.470
Such as bringing Wonder Woman back
as our captive.

18:17.743 --> 18:19.540
Capture Wonder Woman?

18:20.513 --> 18:23.346
That is something the high command
has been unable to do.

18:23.416 --> 18:24.781
Steigler's a very important man.

18:24.850 --> 18:27.045
The Americans won't let him go
without a struggle.

18:27.119 --> 18:30.316
- We have to get out of here fast.
- Absolutely not.

18:30.856 --> 18:34.121
Steigler is of such importance
to American military intelligence...

18:34.193 --> 18:37.720
that I'm positive Wonder Woman
will try to find him and free him.

18:37.797 --> 18:41.359
And when she does,
Gargantua will be waiting for her.

18:44.004 --> 18:46.564
I have seen what your Gargantua can do.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.609
But still,
how can you expect him to accomplish...

18:49.676 --> 18:53.043
what the entire Nazi secret service
has failed to do?

18:53.180 --> 18:56.479
Because I have taken
a great deal of trouble training him.

19:32.653 --> 19:34.814
Remember that midshipman
I went out with last week?

19:34.889 --> 19:36.117
See the resemblance?

19:37.825 --> 19:41.522
Just looking at that picture of Gargantua
is enough to scare you.

19:41.596 --> 19:43.325
He's just a poor animal.

19:43.464 --> 19:45.955
First they capture him
and take him from his home.

19:46.033 --> 19:47.762
Then they coop him up in a cage.

19:47.835 --> 19:50.633
And now they've got armed men
scouring the city for him.

19:52.874 --> 19:54.808
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

19:54.876 --> 19:58.403
- I hope they don't hurt him.
- Hurt who?

19:59.181 --> 20:02.708
Gargantua. He escaped
from the circus last night.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.646
The circus had a story out on him.

20:04.720 --> 20:07.484
He's supposed to be
the smartest ape ever in captivity.

20:07.556 --> 20:10.457
They say he's the closest thing to human
they've ever seen.

20:10.526 --> 20:13.654
Steve, an animal as smart as that...

20:13.896 --> 20:17.957
- if he were thoroughly trained...
- You're making a believer out of me.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.334
Would you find out...

20:20.402 --> 20:23.701
who the most highly respected
animal behavioral scientist is?

20:23.772 --> 20:26.468
- Get a hold of him as quickly as you can.
- Yes, sir.

20:36.718 --> 20:38.516
Sorry to take you away from your work...

20:38.588 --> 20:41.056
but it's a real break
having a behavioral scientist...

20:41.124 --> 20:42.989
of your renown right here in Washington.

20:43.059 --> 20:45.527
I don't mind,
but if it really was a gorilla...

20:45.595 --> 20:48.530
it looks like
you've got quite a situation on your hands.

20:53.436 --> 20:56.803
- It is definitely gorilla hair, Major.
- You're sure?

20:57.340 --> 20:59.365
Would a gorilla
have the strength to do this?

20:59.442 --> 21:02.036
And destroy a desk made of solid oak?

21:02.178 --> 21:06.342
Gorillas do have enormous power,
but I've never seen anything like this.

21:06.416 --> 21:09.317
- I didn't think they were that violent.
- You're right.

21:09.385 --> 21:12.479
Actually, they're a lot less ferocious
than people think.

21:12.555 --> 21:15.217
Let's say, for the sake of argument,
it was a gorilla.

21:15.291 --> 21:19.558
What would make him climb up
this building, break in, take Steigler out?

21:19.630 --> 21:22.963
I don't know,
unless he was trained to do it.

21:23.934 --> 21:25.526
- Trained?
- Yes.

21:25.603 --> 21:28.197
Advanced animal training
is one of our newest fields...

21:28.272 --> 21:33.005
and the Nazis reportedly are carrying on
even more advanced experiments.

21:33.077 --> 21:35.705
And it's really possible
to train a gorilla to do that?

21:35.779 --> 21:36.837
Very possible.

21:42.853 --> 21:45.321
Come on, Steve. A gorilla?

21:45.856 --> 21:48.120
They'll laugh me out of
the general staff meeting.

21:48.192 --> 21:52.026
I know it sounds fantastic, sir, but we
have to consider it as a real possibility.

21:52.096 --> 21:54.462
It's like something
out of a King Kong movie.

21:57.334 --> 21:59.200
Maj. Trevor's office.

21:59.671 --> 22:01.798
Yes, sir. One moment, please.

22:02.107 --> 22:04.234
- It's Dr. Osmond.
- Thank you.

22:05.610 --> 22:07.908
Maj. Trevor speaking. Yes.

22:09.581 --> 22:10.843
We'll be right over.

22:13.985 --> 22:17.045
Dr. Osmond at Beta Research
has just completed his tests.

22:17.122 --> 22:19.386
He says he has something
very important to show me.

22:19.457 --> 22:21.584
Will you excuse us, General?

22:33.705 --> 22:36.196
- Dr. Osmond?
- Look at this.

22:36.675 --> 22:39.577
That hair sample is from Steigler's room.

22:39.712 --> 22:42.977
It is definitely
of the Gorilla beringei maximums...

22:43.049 --> 22:44.346
the great ape.

22:44.884 --> 22:47.114
The guard was right
about seeing a giant gorilla.

22:47.186 --> 22:48.813
And look at this.

22:49.488 --> 22:52.150
The gorilla must have stepped
into some mud...

22:52.224 --> 22:54.658
while he was crashing through that fence.

22:54.727 --> 22:58.493
The mud hardened.
We have a perfect footprint.

22:58.597 --> 23:00.428
I've measured it very carefully.

23:02.001 --> 23:05.266
I'd have to say he's over seven feet tall.

23:05.337 --> 23:07.805
Doctor, is it possible
the Nazis could've trained it...

23:07.873 --> 23:11.775
- to scale the wall of a five-story building?
- That wouldn't be too difficult.

23:11.844 --> 23:14.278
And have trained it
to break in and get Steigler out?

23:14.346 --> 23:17.248
That would require advanced techniques.

23:17.317 --> 23:19.785
However, if someone
would have taken a baby ape...

23:19.853 --> 23:22.879
and given him
a sophisticated training program...

23:22.956 --> 23:25.481
there's no telling what he might do.

23:31.131 --> 23:32.496
Watch this.

23:33.366 --> 23:36.392
Remember, hunger is his basic drive...

23:37.204 --> 23:38.796
yet he obeys my command.

23:45.412 --> 23:48.142
Is it possible to gain complete control
over an animal?

23:48.215 --> 23:51.651
- In theory, yes.
- It doesn't seem fair.

23:51.718 --> 23:54.050
Animals should be free,
not controlled by people.

23:54.121 --> 23:57.216
We animal behaviorists
experiment with animals...

23:57.291 --> 23:59.259
in order to learn more about people.

23:59.327 --> 24:03.320
We've often felt the great ape
would be ideal for advanced training.

24:03.564 --> 24:04.588
Why the great ape?

24:04.665 --> 24:06.963
Because of the high degree
of his intelligence.

24:07.034 --> 24:10.492
Steve, if we found the ape,
we may find Steigler.

24:11.639 --> 24:14.608
That's an interesting assumption,
but there's not much to go on.

24:14.675 --> 24:16.074
Perhaps I can help.

24:19.514 --> 24:21.379
Look at this, Major.

24:23.117 --> 24:25.881
Do you see the difference
between the normal gorilla hair...

24:25.953 --> 24:28.353
and the one we found in the apartment?

24:28.422 --> 24:31.289
The one on the right
looks like it has something stuck on it.

24:31.359 --> 24:34.624
The strands of gorilla hairs
we found in Steigler's room...

24:34.695 --> 24:37.756
seem to have
a foreign, oily substance on them.

24:38.667 --> 24:40.396
- Was it fresh?
- Yes.

24:40.536 --> 24:43.994
Or else the animal's natural body fluids
would have carried it away.

24:45.107 --> 24:48.634
Now where could an ape that size
come in contact with oil?

24:48.744 --> 24:51.872
The analysis showed it was crude oil.

24:52.581 --> 24:55.812
Crude oil? Let's see.

24:55.951 --> 24:58.419
Some oil tankers are being repaired
near the navy yard.

24:58.487 --> 25:00.819
Good thought,
but there's too much activity there.

25:00.889 --> 25:03.687
I should think it would have to be
in a fairly remote section.

25:03.759 --> 25:07.889
Isn't it possible he could have
brushed against a gasoline tank or engine?

25:07.963 --> 25:11.160
The specimen was definitely unrefined oil.

25:11.834 --> 25:14.962
A refinery. There's one
near the old Georgetown Road.

25:15.037 --> 25:19.031
- Yes, that's the Gillion Oil Refinery.
- No, that can't be it.

25:19.142 --> 25:22.634
They work round the clock for the war.
There are hundreds of people there.

25:22.712 --> 25:26.614
The Gillion Oil Refinery moved
to a new location six months ago.

25:26.683 --> 25:31.382
- I think the old refinery is still empty.
- That's right. I'd better check that out.

25:31.454 --> 25:33.513
Excuse me, Doctor.
Diana, call headquarters.

25:33.590 --> 25:35.353
- Tell them where I am.
- Yes, sir.

25:35.425 --> 25:37.518
- May I use your phone?
- Yes, certainly.

25:45.702 --> 25:47.067
Gen. Blankenship's office.

25:47.136 --> 25:48.125
Hello, Etta.

25:48.204 --> 25:49.899
Hi, Diana. Where are you?

25:50.273 --> 25:52.241
I'm still at Dr. Osmond's lab.

25:52.308 --> 25:56.006
Steve asked me to leave word
that he's gone to the Gillion Oil Refinery.

25:56.080 --> 25:58.014
- The old one.
- What's he doing there?

25:58.082 --> 25:59.549
He's following up on a lead.

25:59.617 --> 26:02.552
The old Gillion Refinery
hasn't been used in a long time.

26:02.620 --> 26:05.054
Steve could be in real danger
going there alone.

26:05.122 --> 26:07.818
I was just thinking
the same thing, Etta. Bye.

27:04.182 --> 27:05.809
Someone is at Gate 2.

27:13.625 --> 27:15.150
It's Wonder Woman!

27:15.895 --> 27:18.659
- I knew she'd find us.
- How were you so sure?

27:18.731 --> 27:23.430
A clue I left to lead them here. A little
gorilla hair streaked with crude oil.

27:25.738 --> 27:29.401
Have you forgotten her special bracelets?
You can't get a bullet near her.

27:29.475 --> 27:31.602
I'll have to see that with my own eyes.

27:34.981 --> 27:38.246
But it's true, Carl.
From all our reports on Wonder Woman...

27:38.317 --> 27:40.251
your bullets will be completely ineffective.

27:40.319 --> 27:41.877
But gentlemen, don't worry.

27:41.954 --> 27:44.252
Gargantua will take care
of Wonder Woman.

27:48.394 --> 27:50.988
- Now, my friend, call her.
- Why are you doing this?

27:51.063 --> 27:53.657
- Call her.
- I thought we were going to escape.

27:53.766 --> 27:55.200
Call her now.

27:56.069 --> 27:59.004
And if you try to warn her,
you're a dead man.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.164
Help!

28:11.518 --> 28:13.645
Steigler! Are you all right?

28:21.328 --> 28:24.024
Wonder Woman, meet Gargantua.

28:24.364 --> 28:27.265
- What have you done to this poor animal?
- Experimenting.

28:30.037 --> 28:31.129
Have you hurt him?

28:31.204 --> 28:34.071
Gargantua is living proof of my theory...

28:34.141 --> 28:36.542
to alter the response factor
of wild animals.

28:36.611 --> 28:39.171
Why can't you just let him be free
and live in peace?

28:39.247 --> 28:42.148
Because now we can bring them
under our complete control.

28:45.286 --> 28:46.753
In there, please.

28:48.956 --> 28:51.254
Enough! Do as Erica says.

28:53.061 --> 28:54.528
I said in there.

29:03.304 --> 29:04.362
Move!

29:28.664 --> 29:30.598
Good luck, Wonder Woman.

29:32.167 --> 29:34.567
Gargantua, stop. I'm your friend.

29:36.805 --> 29:39.399
You don't understand.
They are your enemy.

29:49.551 --> 29:51.519
Gargantua, listen to me.

30:59.156 --> 31:02.023
I'm your friend. I don't want to hurt you.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.688
Gargantua, listen to me.

31:17.108 --> 31:19.508
You three men
go up the stairs around the back.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.843
You three men go around the side.
Sergeant, you come with me.

31:29.788 --> 31:31.119
The Americans!

31:37.162 --> 31:39.630
- Hurry! The back gate!
- We can't leave Gargantua.

31:39.698 --> 31:41.495
Erica, there's no time.

32:00.987 --> 32:03.182
- Wonder Woman!
- No, don't shoot.

32:07.526 --> 32:10.757
Why did you shoot him?
He didn't know what he was doing.

32:12.131 --> 32:13.996
I'm so sorry, my friend.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.393
Wonder Woman, are you all right?

32:17.470 --> 32:21.031
I'm fine, but he's hurt.
The sergeant didn't understand.

32:21.107 --> 32:24.508
This poor, innocent animal
is just being used by the Nazis.

32:25.878 --> 32:27.846
- Maj. Trevor, they got away.
- How?

32:27.913 --> 32:31.610
They had a car parked by the back gate.
A black sedan. It took off in a hurry.

32:31.684 --> 32:35.781
- Couldn't get the license number.
- Steve, Conrad Steigler's with them.

32:35.856 --> 32:39.849
Corporal, contact the civilian police.
Describe the sedan and the people in it.

32:39.926 --> 32:42.451
Maybe they can come up with something
on an APB.

32:46.166 --> 32:47.497
He needs medical help.

32:50.937 --> 32:54.065
I'll keep him sedated.
I don't want him too active.

32:55.042 --> 32:56.600
What have they done to him?

32:56.677 --> 32:59.077
The great ape is not
a naturally vicious creature.

32:59.146 --> 33:02.411
It's a remarkable example
of neuro-psycho training.

33:03.116 --> 33:06.108
Probably accomplished
by some advanced method...

33:06.186 --> 33:08.381
of electro-nerve stimulus.

33:08.955 --> 33:12.949
I know it's only a flesh wound,
but I'm sure he's very frightened.

33:13.361 --> 33:14.589
Yes.

33:14.662 --> 33:16.527
I wonder why he didn't kill Steigler.

33:16.597 --> 33:20.431
It's possible they've trained him
to harm only certain people.

33:21.336 --> 33:23.031
Among them, Wonder Woman.

33:23.805 --> 33:26.171
- Why me?
- Maybe the Nazis felt...

33:26.274 --> 33:29.209
he'd be an ideal match for you,
Wonder Woman.

33:30.545 --> 33:35.073
At home on Paradise Island
we live in peace with all animals...

33:35.483 --> 33:37.678
including those you call "ferocious. "

33:43.124 --> 33:44.819
What are you going to do with him now?

33:44.892 --> 33:47.292
It may be possible to reprogram him.

33:47.362 --> 33:49.887
- He won't suffer, will he?
- No.

33:49.964 --> 33:53.765
- The techniques we use are painless.
- I'm glad.

33:54.737 --> 33:56.534
He'll be in good hands now.

34:15.690 --> 34:17.851
We can't stay here.
The Americans will find us.

34:17.926 --> 34:20.393
You said our agents
haven't used this place for years.

34:20.462 --> 34:23.192
What about him?
We don't know what he's told them.

34:23.264 --> 34:25.824
No, I swear it.
I didn't give them any locations.

34:25.900 --> 34:27.801
How can we believe a traitor?

34:30.339 --> 34:31.864
Wonder Woman is alive!

34:31.975 --> 34:33.772
- What about Gargantua?
- He's wounded.

34:33.842 --> 34:36.038
- Where is he?
- What difference does it make?

34:36.112 --> 34:38.978
- Wonder Woman could find us.
- Where have they taken Gargantua?

34:39.047 --> 34:40.514
I don't know.

34:40.817 --> 34:45.481
The success of my program
is as important as this Steigler project.

34:45.722 --> 34:47.155
I must find Gargantua.

34:47.223 --> 34:49.282
I say we have Steigler. Let's get out.

34:49.359 --> 34:51.520
There's only one place
they could've taken him.

34:51.594 --> 34:52.754
Where?

34:54.164 --> 34:58.225
Besides my father
and Prof. Nozaki of Japan...

34:58.868 --> 35:01.098
Dr. Osmond here in Washington...

35:01.171 --> 35:04.732
is the most informed man
in animal behavior in the world.

35:05.642 --> 35:07.576
I'll return with Gargantua tonight!

35:07.644 --> 35:12.514
Erica, the U-boat leaves in four hours.
If you're not back, we leave without you.

35:22.493 --> 35:24.893
Careful, Diana,
don't get too close to the cage.

35:24.962 --> 35:26.862
Don't worry. I'll be all right.

35:26.931 --> 35:29.491
I've gone about as far as I can with him.

35:29.567 --> 35:32.127
- You've done a wonderful job, Doctor.
- Thank you.

35:33.270 --> 35:37.206
- Will Gargantua be all right, Doctor?
- I hope so.

35:37.274 --> 35:40.175
Tomorrow I'll start giving him
visual images...

35:40.244 --> 35:42.712
together with electro-memoric therapy.

35:42.780 --> 35:45.248
- That won't be painful, will it?
- Of course not.

35:45.316 --> 35:49.685
It's frightening to think the Nazis
were trying to turn this ape into a slave.

36:04.736 --> 36:07.296
Looks like you made yourself
a friend, Diana.

36:38.337 --> 36:39.634
Yes?

36:39.705 --> 36:41.900
- Dr. Osmond?
- Yes, I'm Osmond.

36:42.208 --> 36:45.075
I'm Erica Belgard.
I'm Otto Belgard's daughter.

36:46.345 --> 36:49.405
- You must be here with the circus.
- Yes.

36:49.982 --> 36:53.247
- May we come in?
- Yes, certainly!

36:58.791 --> 37:01.419
Are you enjoying your stay in America?

37:04.263 --> 37:06.857
You're the one who trained him! Help!

37:15.842 --> 37:18.470
What's the matter?
Have they done something to him?

37:18.545 --> 37:22.276
I don't know. They must have
altered his response factor. Picture.

37:31.325 --> 37:34.158
They have. They've reprogrammed him.

37:34.394 --> 37:36.555
Then there's no way
you can bring him back.

37:36.630 --> 37:38.427
You've lost control of him.

37:42.369 --> 37:44.963
I'll give him a shot, Hans.
You get to truck.

37:47.107 --> 37:50.236
This is a list of every known Nazi
and fifth column location...

37:50.311 --> 37:52.108
within a hundred miles of Washington.

37:52.180 --> 37:53.772
I'll check them out, sir.

37:53.848 --> 37:56.373
We've started checking
the locations Steigler gave us...

37:56.451 --> 37:57.748
before he was captured.

37:57.819 --> 38:01.152
Good. I'm sure you're following up
on all your leads.

38:01.456 --> 38:03.617
You know how it is
when they're on your back.

38:03.691 --> 38:06.592
- Give this one a little extra, will you?
- Right, sir.

38:08.596 --> 38:10.257
I wish I could be of more help.

38:12.333 --> 38:14.995
You already do more
than your share around here, Diana.

38:23.978 --> 38:27.277
The U-boat has been delayed.
The Coast Guard has tracked them down.

38:27.348 --> 38:29.043
They've gone on silent running.

38:29.117 --> 38:31.712
They want to change
the pickup time to 1400.

38:32.154 --> 38:34.520
- Agreed!
- Excellent.

38:34.890 --> 38:39.122
By then, I'm sure Gargantua will be
reprogrammed to kill Wonder Woman.

38:39.395 --> 38:41.625
You had your chance, Erica.

38:41.697 --> 38:45.189
- Steigler's the only thing that matters.
- I agree with Carl.

38:45.267 --> 38:47.064
We leave right now.

38:47.670 --> 38:50.002
All right, Hans. We'll go.

38:50.973 --> 38:53.965
But remember,
my report to the high command...

38:54.043 --> 38:58.707
will have to be that you personally aborted
my plans to capture Wonder Woman.

39:00.449 --> 39:02.110
Shall I tell them that?

39:02.418 --> 39:06.718
Shall I tell them it was because of you
we failed to capture Wonder Woman?

39:07.990 --> 39:10.858
All right, Erica. We'll play it your way.

39:11.961 --> 39:15.021
But remember, it's your responsibility.

39:15.699 --> 39:17.064
It'll work.

39:18.301 --> 39:21.532
I need a few items
to reprogram Gargantua.

39:30.680 --> 39:34.741
As I increase the power, force him
to look at this picture of Wonder Woman.

39:35.151 --> 39:38.245
What makes you think
this makeshift setup will work this time?

39:38.321 --> 39:39.447
It’ll work!

40:03.447 --> 40:05.312
I'll increase the power.

40:17.795 --> 40:20.696
It's working! Keep the picture there.

40:44.623 --> 40:46.784
Unit 4 calling Maj. Trevor. Over.

40:47.058 --> 40:49.049
Go ahead, Unit 4. This is Maj. Trevor. Over.

40:49.127 --> 40:52.028
We've spotted the group by pier 19,
in an old warehouse.

40:52.097 --> 40:53.428
Do you want us to move in?

40:53.498 --> 40:55.398
Negative. Stay out of sight.

40:55.767 --> 40:57.291
I'll bring some backup units.

40:57.369 --> 41:00.167
If they move, notify this frequency
and follow them. Over.

41:00.238 --> 41:01.603
Unit 4. Over.

41:05.811 --> 41:07.176
I must find him.

41:07.445 --> 41:10.847
He'll hear the whistle and come back.
I know the programming worked.

41:11.684 --> 41:14.710
He could be anywhere, Erica.
This warehouse is huge.

41:16.088 --> 41:19.182
We must search outside.
We must not let him go.

41:21.160 --> 41:24.960
Please, we've wasted too much time.
We still have time to get to the U-boat.

41:26.933 --> 41:28.457
Careful, Steve.

41:28.701 --> 41:32.660
Don't worry. Is the warehouse
one of the locations Steigler gave us?

41:33.573 --> 41:35.666
- Yes, sir.
- It's near the water.

41:36.475 --> 41:38.841
Their plan must be
to get Steigler out by sub.

41:38.911 --> 41:42.813
The Coast Guard's been tailing a U-boat
that's been prowling the coast for days.

41:51.124 --> 41:54.753
I'm sorry, Diana. You better stay here.
This one's too dangerous.

41:54.828 --> 41:55.954
Yes, sir.

43:34.930 --> 43:36.557
They're escaping!

43:42.071 --> 43:43.402
Gargantua!

43:45.341 --> 43:46.933
What have they done to you?

43:48.645 --> 43:49.634
Stop!

43:50.313 --> 43:52.076
I can't breathe.

43:54.951 --> 43:56.350
We're friends.

44:02.993 --> 44:04.324
Please stop.

44:15.338 --> 44:18.466
Sorry. I didn't want to do that.

44:19.275 --> 44:21.072
Does your wound still hurt?

44:21.845 --> 44:25.042
You and I have no quarrel.
I only want to help you.

44:26.950 --> 44:29.044
Your arm is still bleeding.

44:29.487 --> 44:31.455
This terrible thing
wouldn't have happened...

44:31.522 --> 44:33.752
if you'd been raised on Paradise Island.

44:34.658 --> 44:38.321
You've been used as a tool of man.
You should be free.

45:08.994 --> 45:12.486
You mustn't hurt anyone. Not even her.

45:14.900 --> 45:17.960
I won't hurt you. Come with me.

45:20.172 --> 45:22.697
Wonder Woman! How did you know
where to find Steigler?

45:22.774 --> 45:25.106
That's not important. At least he's safe.

45:25.177 --> 45:27.270
But I'm afraid the other two men escaped.

45:27.345 --> 45:30.143
- We stopped them outside the warehouse.
- Good.

45:31.149 --> 45:32.673
What happened to Gargantua?

45:33.752 --> 45:37.586
Erica obviously tried to reprogram him
and he went berserk.

45:37.856 --> 45:39.983
But I think he's all right now.

45:40.058 --> 45:42.151
He must have sensed
you wouldn't have hurt him.

45:42.227 --> 45:44.923
It's just a little kindness
and tenderness and love...

45:44.996 --> 45:47.431
that transcends those barriers
with animals.

45:50.970 --> 45:52.164
And with people.

45:54.540 --> 45:56.167
Wonder Woman, you're amazing.

46:14.760 --> 46:16.125
Hello, Gargantua.

46:18.898 --> 46:23.301
I know you're safe here, but I just hate
to see you locked up in a cage like this.

46:41.989 --> 46:43.479
Don't be afraid.

46:43.557 --> 46:44.546
Let's go.

47:19.227 --> 47:20.751
Isn't it beautiful?

47:24.532 --> 47:27.695
I'm glad you're here.
It's very much like my home.

47:28.136 --> 47:29.694
The trees.

47:30.738 --> 47:34.299
Now you're free to roam the jungle
with the rest of your friends.

47:35.243 --> 47:37.336
There'll be no Nazis to harm you.

47:38.313 --> 47:40.508
It's time to say goodbye for now,
my friend.

47:40.582 --> 47:42.573
Perhaps we'll meet again someday.

48:21.624 --> 48:24.422
It's just not like Diana
to take time off like this.

48:24.493 --> 48:26.826
I'm sure she'll be back any minute, Major.

48:26.896 --> 48:28.363
Where did you say she went?

48:28.431 --> 48:31.025
She just said she had an errand to run.

48:31.801 --> 48:34.361
What kind of an errand
could take all afternoon?

48:35.005 --> 48:36.370
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

48:38.875 --> 48:41.139
- Steve, Etta.
- Diana.

48:41.211 --> 48:44.578
- I was beginning to worry about you.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

48:44.948 --> 48:47.644
I just had to drop off a friend.
