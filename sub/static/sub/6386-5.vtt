00:00.332 --> 00:02.233
Previously
on <i>Californication...</i>

00:02.267 --> 00:04.135
Quite the literary scandal
we have here.

00:04.169 --> 00:07.104
What if she came clean?
You get your book back.

00:07.139 --> 00:08.873
Think about Karen.
Think about Becca.

00:08.907 --> 00:11.676
This is gonna hurt them.
Is that what you want?

00:11.710 --> 00:14.011
It's not like I'm going
to press charges or anything.

00:14.046 --> 00:15.279
You okay, baby?

00:19.751 --> 00:21.953
The D.A.'s office is willing
to drop the assault charges.

00:21.987 --> 00:22.987
- The bad news?
- You're being charged

00:23.021 --> 00:24.956
with statutory rape.

00:24.990 --> 00:28.326
Fuck, the rabbit done died.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.028
Why does <i>Hashem</i> hate me?

00:31.063 --> 00:32.830
- Okay, so whose is it?
- I don't know.

00:32.864 --> 00:34.765
- Charlie's?
- Fuck no!

00:34.800 --> 00:38.336
That kid's all snipped
to shreds... It can't be him.

00:38.370 --> 00:40.805
We could actually use
a lead guitarist.

00:40.839 --> 00:42.106
What do you guys
call yourselves?

00:42.140 --> 00:43.107
Queens of Dogtown.

00:43.141 --> 00:44.442
This is a great case for me.

00:44.476 --> 00:45.843
But if you insist on
dicking around

00:45.877 --> 00:48.245
and wasting my time, I'm happy
to see you rot in jail.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.347
What the fuck do I care?

00:49.381 --> 00:50.648
Probably not the best time
for me

00:50.682 --> 00:52.717
to be getting involved
with the actress

00:52.751 --> 00:55.553
who's gonna play the girl
who I raped, allegedly.

00:55.587 --> 00:57.421
That doesn't mean
I don't want one or more

00:57.456 --> 01:00.091
of your fingers
in my vagina right now.

01:00.125 --> 01:01.525
Why do you gotta talk
to me like that?

01:07.566 --> 01:09.767
Mornin', sassafras!

01:09.801 --> 01:12.570
- If you say so.
- Don't be such a naysayer.

01:12.604 --> 01:13.804
You'll get frown lines.

01:13.839 --> 01:14.905
And then you'll have
to botox that shit.

01:14.940 --> 01:16.874
- Hank, what do you want?
- Oh, that.

01:16.908 --> 01:18.909
I'd like to come in and grab
my one and only suit.

01:18.944 --> 01:20.311
I've got some legal doings
this A.M.

01:20.345 --> 01:21.679
Too late. Threw it out.

01:21.713 --> 01:24.281
Bullshit. You would never
throw away a man's suit.

01:24.316 --> 01:26.450
You'd donate it, maybe,
but that's ridiculous.

01:26.485 --> 01:28.119
Who's needier than I am
right now?

01:28.153 --> 01:32.456
I hate you. I...hate you.

01:32.491 --> 01:37.261
What do you think?
How do I look?

01:37.295 --> 01:40.398
Like a statutory rapist
in a suit.

01:40.432 --> 01:42.500
Man, you are on fire
this morning!

01:42.534 --> 01:44.802
The wit is strong in you,
young Skywalker.

01:44.836 --> 01:46.904
And dark too. I dig it.

01:46.938 --> 01:48.706
Speaking of dark,
how's Lenny Kravitz?

01:48.740 --> 01:50.941
- Excuse me?
- You know, Ben Harper.

01:50.976 --> 01:53.444
That van-sized,
caramel-colored man

01:53.478 --> 01:54.478
you've been
hanging around with.

01:54.513 --> 01:56.981
Um, none of your business.

01:57.015 --> 01:58.149
I mean, should I be worried?

01:58.183 --> 02:00.551
He does seem dangerously cool.

02:00.585 --> 02:03.454
Kind of like a young
Lando Calrissian, with a dream.

02:03.488 --> 02:05.489
You have nothing
to worry about, Hank.

02:05.524 --> 02:08.059
Because worrying would be
a waste of your time.

02:08.092 --> 02:11.495
The mailman has a better shot
than you do right now.

02:11.530 --> 02:12.930
Have you seen our mailman?
He's quite toothsome.

02:12.964 --> 02:15.199
Especially in his summer shorts.

02:15.233 --> 02:18.102
What are... Come on.

02:20.005 --> 02:21.972
You tricked me.

02:22.007 --> 02:24.375
- You did it on purpose.
- Old habits die hard.

02:24.409 --> 02:26.310
- You smell nice.
- You're a jerk.

02:26.344 --> 02:29.647
Like lady shampoo...
And cinnamon toothpaste.

02:29.681 --> 02:32.583
A little bit of coffee breath.
A touch of the hal.

02:32.617 --> 02:36.120
No worries, I'd still do ya.

02:37.756 --> 02:39.690
Hey, sweetie.

02:42.561 --> 02:44.261
Well, what do you think
of your old man?

02:44.296 --> 02:46.931
- You know what they say.
- Mm.

02:46.965 --> 02:49.667
You can't polish a turd.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.074

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:37.349 --> 03:40.417
Did he have any idea
how old you were?

03:40.452 --> 03:41.852
No.

03:41.887 --> 03:44.755
He probably thought
I was in my 20s.

03:44.790 --> 03:48.793
- Did he ever ask?
- No.

03:48.827 --> 03:53.464
- Did you ever tell him?
- No.

03:53.498 --> 03:55.266
Is it true that you
punched him in the face

03:55.300 --> 03:57.067
during intercourse?

03:57.102 --> 04:01.038
Yes. Twice, actually.

04:01.072 --> 04:02.672
Why?

04:06.545 --> 04:11.615
I, uh...
Wanted him to remember me.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.853
You know what this means,
right?

04:16.887 --> 04:19.824
Yes. It's obvious.

04:19.858 --> 04:21.425
I'm very good in bed?

04:21.459 --> 04:25.563
That, and the prosecution
has a lame case.

04:25.597 --> 04:29.400
And they know it too.
Expect a deal imminently.

04:29.434 --> 04:30.534
Ooh, I like it
when you say "imminently."

04:30.569 --> 04:31.769
It gets me a little hard.

04:31.803 --> 04:33.003
Good to know.

04:33.038 --> 04:34.371
Okay, well,
we've got to celebrate.

04:34.406 --> 04:37.508
Slow down. It's a little early
for candles and cake.

04:37.542 --> 04:39.009
Well, I'll be having dinner,
you can do whatever you want.

04:39.044 --> 04:41.278
As long as it involves alcohol
and bad decisions.

04:41.313 --> 04:43.547
Sorry, I have a dinner tonight.

04:43.582 --> 04:45.049
What's his name?

04:45.083 --> 04:46.717
Vanessa.

04:46.751 --> 04:47.718
- Vanessa?
- Mm-hmm.

04:47.752 --> 04:48.986
Sounds effeminate to me.

04:49.020 --> 04:51.188
She is.
She's also my best friend.

04:51.223 --> 04:54.959
Oh. Will you two be
brushing each other's hair

04:54.993 --> 04:57.094
at any point
during the evening?

04:57.128 --> 04:59.063
Or perhaps gently massaging
each other's shoulders?

04:59.097 --> 05:01.799
I see why you sleep
with teenagers... You are one.

05:01.833 --> 05:03.767
It's true,
I am kind of retarded.

05:03.802 --> 05:05.269
But I'm also kind of amazing.

05:05.303 --> 05:09.206
Okay, don't forget you have
a 12:00 with Randy and Gary.

05:09.241 --> 05:10.774
And then Lou needs to see you
in his office.

05:10.809 --> 05:13.577
- All right.
- And Jake called.

05:13.612 --> 05:14.612
And he needs
to cancel dinner tonight.

05:14.646 --> 05:15.746
But he sends his love.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.248
<i>J'accuse!</i>

05:17.282 --> 05:18.949
Thank you, Patti.

05:18.984 --> 05:20.084
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Patti.

05:20.118 --> 05:21.719
Very enlightening.

05:21.753 --> 05:23.754
Now you <i>have</i> to have dinner
with me.

05:23.788 --> 05:25.456
Why, because
I adjusted the truth?

05:25.490 --> 05:26.824
I don't owe you any sort
of honesty

05:26.858 --> 05:27.892
about my personal life.

05:27.926 --> 05:29.126
Fair enough. But you told me

05:29.160 --> 05:30.461
you were having dinner
with a woman,

05:30.495 --> 05:32.529
which lead me to believe
that you didn't want me to know

05:32.564 --> 05:33.731
you were having dinner
with a Jake.

05:33.765 --> 05:36.200
Who is probably very handsome,
very fit,

05:36.234 --> 05:37.902
and very fuckin' boring.

05:37.936 --> 05:39.870
Four minutes of mish,
followed by a little oral

05:39.905 --> 05:41.171
to top you off... am I right?

05:41.206 --> 05:42.840
Done in time for Leno.

05:42.874 --> 05:45.643
No, you strike me as
a Letterman gal... is that right?

05:45.677 --> 05:47.678
And why would I mislead you
like that?

05:47.712 --> 05:50.915
Well, that's obvious.
Come on, you're sweet on me.

05:50.949 --> 05:53.584
Does this shit really work
for you, Hank?

05:53.618 --> 05:55.753
Not at all, not really.
I'm just playing.

05:55.787 --> 05:57.922
Don't be hating. I'm in
a good mood because of you.

05:57.956 --> 05:59.790
I'm just trying to show
my <i>mucho appreciato</i>

05:59.824 --> 06:01.325
in my own special way.

06:01.359 --> 06:04.461
Yes, you are special,
all right.

06:04.496 --> 06:09.099
Well, there is something
we could discuss over dinner.

06:09.134 --> 06:11.535
Yes, milady? Anything.

06:11.569 --> 06:13.671
The issue of your bill.

06:17.142 --> 06:18.309
I think I need
some money, Charlie.

06:18.343 --> 06:20.678
You want me to get you
a quickie

06:20.712 --> 06:22.313
dialogue polish or something?

06:22.347 --> 06:24.048
You know, I was thinking
about one of those, uh,

06:24.082 --> 06:25.316
<i>Twilight</i> films.

06:25.350 --> 06:26.450
They seem very popular,

06:26.484 --> 06:28.118
and desperately in need
of word polishing.

06:28.153 --> 06:30.788
I will make some calls,
see what I can do.

06:30.822 --> 06:32.022
You better. You know why?

06:32.057 --> 06:35.059
'Cause this gangsta needs
to get <i>paid!</i>

06:35.093 --> 06:39.063
Okay, now I need
to ask you a favor.

06:39.097 --> 06:41.465
Okay, Charlie,
what can I do for you?

06:47.138 --> 06:48.138
Where's your cock?

06:48.173 --> 06:50.507
And there's my answer.

06:50.542 --> 06:51.875
Oh, I see it.

06:51.910 --> 06:54.111
It's right under your clit.

06:54.145 --> 06:58.182
Oh, those are your balls.
Shit. Wow.

06:58.216 --> 06:59.450
I wanted to know if I should do

06:59.484 --> 07:02.086
a little <i>man-scaping</i>
before my date tonight.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.954
Well, normally I'd be
against such a thing.

07:03.989 --> 07:05.990
A man is at his best
when he's at his hairiest.

07:06.024 --> 07:07.458
At least, that's what my mom
always used to say.

07:07.492 --> 07:10.527
But in your case,
I'd say shave that shit.

07:10.562 --> 07:11.996
Send it off to the poor kids
in China or something.

07:12.030 --> 07:13.931
Jesus, I can't look away.

07:13.965 --> 07:16.934
It's like a forest has grown up

07:16.968 --> 07:18.802
all around one magic mushroom.

07:18.837 --> 07:20.037
It's like a button
on a fur coat.

07:20.071 --> 07:21.638
Well, look on
the bright side, Charlie.

07:21.673 --> 07:23.107
It may be short, but it's thin.

07:23.141 --> 07:26.377
So you think I should,
what, take it all off?

07:26.411 --> 07:30.447
Yeah.
It'll make you look big. <i>Er.</i>

07:30.482 --> 07:32.883
Like Johnny Wad. <i>Ish.</i>

07:32.917 --> 07:35.119
- You think she'll like it?
- Hell yeah.

07:35.153 --> 07:36.854
Who doesn't want
to nude-up with flipper?

07:36.888 --> 07:38.088
All right. Cool.

07:38.123 --> 07:39.523
Should I tell Hank?

07:39.557 --> 07:41.759
About your newfound affinity
for milk chocolate?

07:41.793 --> 07:43.160
Are you crazy?

07:43.194 --> 07:45.662
About his daughter's
first gig at the whiskey,

07:45.697 --> 07:46.764
you dumb slut.

07:46.798 --> 07:48.799
Oh, that. Right.

07:48.833 --> 07:51.935
Yes, you should tell him.
He'd want to be there.

07:51.970 --> 07:53.404
I don't know
if it's such a good idea

07:53.438 --> 07:55.105
'cause he's gonna get
so, like, <i>unh,</i> and...

07:55.140 --> 07:56.473
No, you have...
What are you talking about?

07:56.508 --> 07:58.642
Good evening, ladies!

07:58.676 --> 07:59.710
Hey, Charlie.

07:59.744 --> 08:00.811
Big date.

08:00.845 --> 08:02.546
Coming through. Make way!

08:02.580 --> 08:05.182
Big date. <i>Big date.</i>

08:05.216 --> 08:06.650
Ooh, who's the lucky gal?

08:06.684 --> 08:08.485
Oh, wouldn't you
just like to know?

08:08.520 --> 08:10.387
I don't really
give a fuck, Charlie.

08:10.422 --> 08:12.823
- I'm just making conversation.
- Who is she, Charlie?

08:12.857 --> 08:15.459
I could pretend
to be interested.

08:15.493 --> 08:18.729
Oh, well...
Since you've asked...

08:18.763 --> 08:20.397
I was heading
into a Starbucks bathroom

08:20.432 --> 08:21.398
when she was coming out.

08:21.433 --> 08:22.666
We bonked heads.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.768
- Wow.
- Laughed about it.

08:24.803 --> 08:25.936
Traded numbers.

08:25.970 --> 08:28.472
She is really very pretty.

08:28.506 --> 08:30.741
Which is good because
she left some serious stank

08:30.775 --> 08:32.176
in that bathroom, Karen.

08:32.210 --> 08:33.710
I almost fainted.

08:33.745 --> 08:36.145
Wow, talk about a cute meet.

08:36.181 --> 08:37.748
Speaking of which, can you tell

08:37.782 --> 08:40.784
that fucking producer friend
of yours to stop calling me?

08:40.818 --> 08:42.486
Biggs? Biggsie?

08:42.520 --> 08:44.755
- Beggs? Stu Beggs?
- Yeah.

08:44.789 --> 08:46.990
Whatever the fuck.
He keeps calling and texting.

08:47.025 --> 08:48.792
He thinks we're soul mates
or some shit.

08:48.827 --> 08:49.793
You're not into him?

08:49.828 --> 08:52.062
Fuck no! Should I be?

08:52.097 --> 08:54.231
Well, he is pretty rich.

08:54.265 --> 08:57.067
Really?
How rich we talkin' here?

08:57.102 --> 09:00.170
I don't know. Rich.
Rich in cock too.

09:00.205 --> 09:02.239
He's supposed to have
some legendary <i>schvantz.</i>

09:02.273 --> 09:04.942
Must be nice.

09:04.976 --> 09:06.577
Okay.

09:09.681 --> 09:13.250
I sell jewelry
but it's for men.

09:13.284 --> 09:14.618
- It's called mewlery.
- Awesome.

09:14.652 --> 09:16.653
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.
- Wild.

09:16.688 --> 09:18.956
- There's no profit.
- Nice.

09:18.990 --> 09:21.024
Douche bag says what?

09:21.059 --> 09:22.626
- What?
- Got ya.

09:23.795 --> 09:27.564
Away with you. Begone!

09:27.599 --> 09:31.568
Come here.

09:31.603 --> 09:32.836
You should probably just go.

09:32.871 --> 09:34.738
It's only gonna get worse.

09:38.176 --> 09:40.410
- Hanky!
- Hey.

09:40.445 --> 09:44.081
Oh, it's just like old times,

09:44.115 --> 09:45.616
you rescuing me
from the clutches

09:45.650 --> 09:47.684
of evil hipster douche bags.

09:47.719 --> 09:49.553
Makes me wisty
for the good old days.

09:49.587 --> 09:52.022
Are you okay?
You seem vaguely high.

09:52.056 --> 09:54.158
There's nothing vague
about it... That's the good news.

09:54.192 --> 09:56.460
So what are you doing here?

09:56.494 --> 09:58.295
I live here.
What's your excuse?

09:58.329 --> 10:00.664
I'm having drinks
with Sasha Bingham.

10:00.698 --> 10:02.332
She's gonna pick my brain.

10:02.367 --> 10:04.201
Mm. Sure there's enough
to go around?

10:04.235 --> 10:07.271
Ha ha! Clever. You know her?

10:07.305 --> 10:11.074
- Sasha.
- Sasha? Uh...Well, we've met.

10:11.109 --> 10:14.444
Well, as much as anyone
can know these actor peoples.

10:14.479 --> 10:16.280
You fucked her didn't you?

10:16.314 --> 10:19.416
No. Come on.

10:19.450 --> 10:24.121
She's an embryo. A zygote.
She's a tadpole.

10:24.155 --> 10:26.523
So what was it like
fucking the girl

10:26.558 --> 10:28.458
who's supposed to play me, hmm?

10:28.493 --> 10:29.960
Who, by the way,
♪ you already fu-uucked ♪

10:29.994 --> 10:32.362
Shut up with that already.
What are you on?

10:32.397 --> 10:35.699
Some weed, some wine.
A little Vicodin.

10:35.733 --> 10:37.901
I feel like I'm under
a wet, warm blanket.

10:37.936 --> 10:39.703
That does not sound
very appealing.

10:39.737 --> 10:41.738
You should stay
and have a drink with us.

10:41.773 --> 10:45.742
You should.
Long time no see, Hank Moody.

10:45.777 --> 10:47.411
Hi, Sasha Bingham. How are you?

10:47.445 --> 10:49.880
Oh, fuck.

10:49.914 --> 10:51.215
Missed you.

10:51.249 --> 10:55.085
A-ha, I knew it!

10:58.223 --> 10:59.990
Have you met my attorney?

11:00.024 --> 11:02.025
Hi.

11:17.875 --> 11:19.176
Hmm.

11:19.210 --> 11:21.445
Eeesh.

11:37.962 --> 11:38.962
Here we go.

11:42.267 --> 11:44.268
Not so bad.

11:47.639 --> 11:49.673
Aah! Shh...

11:49.707 --> 11:52.442
I need to get
in there, Charlie!

12:00.051 --> 12:03.420
Aah!

12:03.454 --> 12:08.792
Wait! Wait! Don't go! Don't go!

12:08.826 --> 12:10.761
What the fuck, Charlie?

12:10.795 --> 12:12.462
This is why I don't like
to come here.

12:12.497 --> 12:14.498
I don't blame you.
It's disgusting.

12:14.532 --> 12:15.832
I hurt myself!

12:15.867 --> 12:18.101
What, you get shampoo
in your pee hole again?

12:18.136 --> 12:20.804
No. I <i>cut</i> myself...

12:20.838 --> 12:22.606
Man-scaping.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.675
Of course you did.

12:24.709 --> 12:27.244
- We gotta go.
- Wait, you gotta look!

12:27.278 --> 12:29.813
I don't gotta do anything,
especially when it's disgusting.

12:29.847 --> 12:32.316
Karen, please. Please!

12:32.350 --> 12:33.617
It would pretty much have to be

12:33.651 --> 12:35.319
a life or death
situation, Charlie.

12:35.353 --> 12:37.287
You'd never recover, trust me.

12:37.322 --> 12:39.156
Ladies, please!
I need to know if this is

12:39.190 --> 12:40.824
an emergency room situation.

12:40.858 --> 12:42.526
He's bleeding on the floor.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.261
Aah!

12:44.295 --> 12:46.530
Jesus fucking Christ, Charlie,
we're in escrow,

12:46.564 --> 12:48.999
and you're bleeding
all over my fucking floor?

12:49.033 --> 12:51.335
<i>Your</i> fucking floor?
This is my fucking floor too,

12:51.369 --> 12:52.669
and I'll bleed on it
if I want to!

12:52.704 --> 12:56.540
Holy Jesus, woman,
I'm in dire straits here!

12:56.574 --> 12:58.842
- I'm... I'm gonna go.
- Okay. Yes.

12:58.876 --> 13:02.846
Because then I'll have
to catch up with you.

13:02.880 --> 13:05.248
All right, let's take a look

13:05.283 --> 13:06.783
at what we're
dealing with here.

13:06.818 --> 13:09.653
Okay?

13:09.687 --> 13:14.658
Holy Christ, Charlie,
you took it all off! Why?

13:14.692 --> 13:17.394
I thought it would
make me look big.

13:17.428 --> 13:18.829
<i>Er.</i>

13:18.863 --> 13:20.330
Like Johnny Wad.

13:20.365 --> 13:23.400
Yeah, well, it kind of
makes you look like

13:23.434 --> 13:25.001
Johnny-all-potatoes
and no meat.

13:25.036 --> 13:26.370
Come on.

13:26.404 --> 13:29.873
Let's go put on
some fucking clothes.

13:29.907 --> 13:33.009
I'll drop you off
at the E.R., ya dumb fuck.

13:33.044 --> 13:34.811
You should probably stay
far away

13:34.846 --> 13:36.580
from the Mias and the Sashas
of the world right now.

13:36.614 --> 13:38.882
I just ran into them.
They ran into me.

13:38.916 --> 13:40.784
It was not planned.
It was kismet.

13:40.818 --> 13:41.952
You just run into
a lot of things, don't you?

13:41.986 --> 13:43.420
Yes, I do. That much is true.

13:43.454 --> 13:44.588
But enough about me.

13:44.622 --> 13:46.156
I'd like to learn about you,
counselor.

13:46.190 --> 13:49.826
Okay, you'll get a kick
out of this.

13:49.861 --> 13:51.261
I wrote a novel once.

13:51.295 --> 13:53.764
That's a shame.
What was it about?

13:53.798 --> 13:55.899
What's every shitty
first novel about?

13:55.933 --> 13:58.368
- Nothing and everything.
- Ah.

13:58.403 --> 14:00.504
Mine concerned itself
with the exploits

14:00.538 --> 14:02.239
of a smart girl
in the big city,

14:02.273 --> 14:03.673
looking for Mr. Right,

14:03.708 --> 14:06.009
- fucking a lot of Mr. Right Nows.
- Oh...

14:06.043 --> 14:07.611
All the while putting a ton
of bad shit up her nose.

14:07.645 --> 14:09.546
I'd read that book, sister.

14:09.580 --> 14:11.882
Fuck, I wrote that book,
like, four times

14:11.916 --> 14:13.884
before I actually
ever published anything.

14:13.918 --> 14:15.452
That's just my metier.

14:15.486 --> 14:18.155
Well, your metier
was my epic failure.

14:18.189 --> 14:20.624
I showed it to my boyfriend
at the time... a writer.

14:20.658 --> 14:22.025
- Interesting.
- Mm.

14:22.059 --> 14:24.027
- You like writers.
- Not anymore.

14:24.061 --> 14:25.195
- You do.
- He crapped all over it.

14:25.229 --> 14:29.032
- Fucking cunt.
- Hardly.

14:29.066 --> 14:32.436
I shredded the novel,
broke up with the boyfriend,

14:32.470 --> 14:34.004
and applied to Law School.

14:34.038 --> 14:36.339
In that order.
Happily ever after.

14:36.374 --> 14:38.208
How is it
that your happily ever after

14:38.242 --> 14:40.343
doesn't remotely involve
a dude?

14:40.378 --> 14:42.245
That's easy.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.147
I mean, you see me
as this piece of candy.

14:44.182 --> 14:45.649
- I do not.
- Sure, you do.

14:45.683 --> 14:48.552
Yes, I do, actually.
But in the best way possible.

14:48.586 --> 14:52.622
You're like a...
Sexy gummy bear...

14:52.657 --> 14:55.192
With caramel on the inside.

14:55.226 --> 14:57.060
Like a gummy bear wrapped

14:57.094 --> 14:59.029
around some other kind
of sweet goodness.

14:59.063 --> 15:01.531
Thank you.

15:01.566 --> 15:05.035
But to answer your question,
dudes have a very hard time

15:05.069 --> 15:06.903
with a woman who's addicted
to her profession.

15:06.938 --> 15:08.238
Maybe you just haven't met
the right dude.

15:08.272 --> 15:09.739
Maybe.

15:09.774 --> 15:11.775
But would I even recognize him?

15:11.809 --> 15:14.344
Because all I ever see
is an impediment

15:14.378 --> 15:15.512
to getting my work done.

15:15.546 --> 15:17.447
That makes me sad.

15:17.482 --> 15:20.083
Why, am I missing something?

15:20.117 --> 15:22.819
Doesn't stop me from having sex
with who I want,

15:22.854 --> 15:24.387
when I want.

15:24.422 --> 15:26.089
Okay, I'm less sad now.

15:26.123 --> 15:28.325
Nothing would ever
become of us, Hank.

15:28.359 --> 15:30.026
- How do you know that?
- Let's play a little game.

15:30.061 --> 15:32.028
- Games are fun.
- Let's pretend for a moment

15:32.063 --> 15:34.297
that for us to embark
on a sexual relationship

15:34.332 --> 15:37.200
isn't completely
and utterly inappropriate.

15:37.235 --> 15:38.301
Yes, let's.

15:38.336 --> 15:39.736
You are aware
that said relationship

15:39.770 --> 15:41.471
would go horribly awry

15:41.506 --> 15:44.107
once you realized
I was truly single,

15:44.141 --> 15:47.944
unencumbered,
free to love you and be with you

15:47.979 --> 15:50.113
for the rest of my life.

15:50.147 --> 15:54.851
You're right,
that is a boner killer.

15:54.886 --> 15:56.286
We're a lot alike, you and me.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.988
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

15:58.022 --> 15:59.356
but I think I like
where this is going.

15:59.390 --> 16:00.557
No, I'm serious.

16:00.591 --> 16:02.692
You're a smart, charming guy...

16:02.727 --> 16:04.160
I <i>do</i> like where this is going.

16:04.195 --> 16:06.162
With a lot of fucked-up,
dark shit

16:06.197 --> 16:08.431
running through that
pretty little head of yours.

16:08.466 --> 16:09.933
I can relate.

16:09.967 --> 16:11.835
I've just figured out
a better way to channel it.

16:11.869 --> 16:13.436
That's what the writing's for.

16:13.471 --> 16:15.505
But you think
you can have it all, right?

16:15.540 --> 16:17.941
Dark, swirling chaos
<i>and</i> the white picket fence.

16:17.975 --> 16:19.509
What if one feeds the other?

16:19.544 --> 16:20.911
What if one destroys the other?

16:20.945 --> 16:23.713
Hold on.

16:23.748 --> 16:26.650
Sorry. Force of habit.

16:26.684 --> 16:29.853
Huh? Oh...

16:29.887 --> 16:31.421
- My balls were just vibrating.
- Mm-hmm.

16:31.455 --> 16:33.523
The whole evening.
Thought I had a call.

16:33.558 --> 16:36.660
First time I've heard that.

16:36.694 --> 16:38.562
Oh.

16:38.596 --> 16:41.331
Mm.

16:41.365 --> 16:42.899
Let me guess...

16:42.934 --> 16:44.367
A message from behind
the white picket fence?

16:44.402 --> 16:45.569
How'd you know that?

16:45.603 --> 16:47.437
Because you actually smiled
for once.

16:47.471 --> 16:49.906
Not a smirk, a smile.

16:49.941 --> 16:53.777
Uh, can we have the check?
I gotta go.

16:53.811 --> 16:55.979
Of course you do. Go.

16:56.013 --> 16:59.983
Uh, I will... I will call you
when I know something.

17:00.017 --> 17:03.954
And, Hank, you might consider
smiling more often.

18:49.860 --> 18:51.061
Good night.

18:51.095 --> 18:54.097
That was a riveting 23 seconds.

18:54.131 --> 18:56.232
Thanks for the heads-up.

18:56.267 --> 18:58.668
Consider yourself lucky
that I asked you at all.

18:58.703 --> 19:00.303
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:00.337 --> 19:02.305
- Thanks, man. Cheers.
- Hank!

19:02.339 --> 19:05.375
You're such a...

19:05.409 --> 19:09.212
Thank you.
No, uh... no introduction?

19:09.246 --> 19:12.482
Oh, yeah, uh, this is Ben,

19:12.516 --> 19:14.317
and this is Hank,
Becca's father.

19:14.351 --> 19:15.719
Good to meet you, Hank.

19:15.753 --> 19:18.221
"Becca's father." That's nice.

19:18.255 --> 19:19.456
He's Becca's father.

19:19.490 --> 19:21.791
Come on, man,
don't be that guy.

19:21.826 --> 19:23.560
Don't be that guy?

19:23.594 --> 19:24.861
Don't be the guy
who makes this shit

19:24.895 --> 19:26.730
any weirder
than it has to be, all right?

19:26.764 --> 19:29.265
We're watching our girls
play some music.

19:29.300 --> 19:30.834
There's no need
for an attitude.

19:30.868 --> 19:32.836
You disrespected me
with the beer thing.

19:32.870 --> 19:34.404
But you know what,
I'll let you have that one.

19:34.438 --> 19:36.072
You'll let me have that one?

19:36.107 --> 19:37.907
Yeah, I will.

19:37.942 --> 19:39.709
Long as you buy
the next round. Hmm?

19:39.744 --> 19:41.711
- How's that sound?
- Hey, sweetie.

19:41.746 --> 19:43.913
So good. God, you were great.

19:43.948 --> 19:45.081
Hey...

19:45.116 --> 19:47.617
I'm proud. Very, very proud.

19:47.651 --> 19:50.420
Proud of you.
You were fantastic.

19:50.454 --> 19:52.689
Thank you.

19:52.723 --> 19:54.991
This is my dad.

19:55.025 --> 19:57.127
I thought you said
he was out of the picture.

19:59.396 --> 20:03.767
Hey, Hank, we're gonna take
these two little rock stars

20:03.801 --> 20:04.868
out to get something to eat.

20:04.902 --> 20:07.137
A little post-gig celebration.

20:07.171 --> 20:08.438
You want to join us?

20:14.044 --> 20:15.745
Uh, I... I kinda...
I got a deadline

20:15.780 --> 20:18.081
that I'm working on.

20:18.115 --> 20:20.583
Sweetie, you were just...
I'm so proud of you.

20:20.618 --> 20:23.620
I love you. I love you.

20:23.654 --> 20:24.788
I love you too.

20:24.822 --> 20:28.525
- All right, go on.
- Thanks for coming.

20:28.559 --> 20:29.626
Come on, sweetie.

20:38.569 --> 20:42.038
Stop it, Charlie.
You're fucking clammy.

20:42.072 --> 20:43.840
It's like holding hands
with a <i>merman.</i>

20:43.874 --> 20:45.074
What else is new?

20:45.109 --> 20:47.076
I get nervous, I get moist.
You know this.

20:47.111 --> 20:49.012
What's with all the scarring
down here, huh?

20:49.046 --> 20:51.414
Your scrotum feels
like a relief map.

20:51.448 --> 20:53.216
Oh, I've had a couple
of vasectomies.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.652
A couple?
What, did you have a reversal?

20:55.686 --> 20:56.953
No, the first snip didn't take.

20:56.987 --> 20:58.087
I had to have another.

20:58.122 --> 21:00.156
Doctor said it happens
sometimes.

21:00.191 --> 21:02.358
Yeah, sometimes. Not often.
Who was your guy?

21:02.393 --> 21:06.062
I don't know,
some Indian fella.

21:06.096 --> 21:08.198
Unpronounceable last name.

21:08.232 --> 21:10.033
Over in west L.A. by the 405.

21:11.168 --> 21:12.735
Why are you laughing?

21:12.770 --> 21:14.838
I'm sorry.
That's piggish, you're right.

21:14.872 --> 21:16.840
It's just that I've heard
of you poor bastards before.

21:16.874 --> 21:17.974
I've just never actually
met one.

21:18.008 --> 21:20.410
What are you talking about?

21:20.444 --> 21:21.744
You found him in the back
of the <i>L.A. Weekly,</i> did ya?

21:21.779 --> 21:23.913
Yeah, so? I was
a young agent on a budget.

21:23.948 --> 21:25.081
Ow!

21:25.115 --> 21:26.983
I told you not to skimp
on that shit!

21:27.017 --> 21:29.385
Guy lost his license last year.

21:29.420 --> 21:31.621
- Malpractice.
- Why? What happened?

21:31.655 --> 21:33.356
Know what the other
dick docs call him?

21:33.390 --> 21:35.525
Weenie Todd, the demon urologist
of the West Side.

21:35.559 --> 21:36.659
He was a real butcher.

21:36.694 --> 21:38.761
For whatever reason,
he really enjoyed...

21:38.796 --> 21:39.996
How do I put this delicately?

21:40.030 --> 21:41.898
Oh, yeah, fucking around
with men's genitalia.

21:41.932 --> 21:44.500
- Which is fine, except...
- I think I'm gonna pass out.

21:44.535 --> 21:45.835
Oh, no, no. Oh, there we go.

21:45.870 --> 21:47.437
Hey, don't worry about it.
He'll be fine.

21:47.471 --> 21:48.972
This happens all the time.

21:49.006 --> 21:52.442
So what, exactly,
are you saying here, doc?

21:52.476 --> 21:54.577
There still could be swimmers
in his junk?

21:54.612 --> 21:56.713
Well, I bet if he gave me
a sperm sample,

21:56.747 --> 21:57.714
we'd find a couple
of little dudes

21:57.748 --> 21:59.349
swimming around in there, sure.

21:59.383 --> 22:01.017
Not that he's gonna have
an erection anytime soon.

Hey, what's up, mama Mia?

Mind if I join you...

23:07.518 --> 23:09.752
On the ledge?

23:09.787 --> 23:11.821
Don't know why you'd want to.

23:11.855 --> 23:13.856
I'm not very good company
tonight.

23:13.891 --> 23:18.361
Oh, come on, you're
always good for a laugh or two.

23:18.395 --> 23:23.366
Ahh...Ooh...

23:23.400 --> 23:25.268
Bet you didn't know
I was afraid of heights,

23:25.302 --> 23:26.502
did you?

23:26.537 --> 23:29.872
You never struck me
as scared of anything.

23:29.907 --> 23:31.841
Negress, please!

23:31.875 --> 23:34.210
I'm a big old fraidy cat.

23:37.681 --> 23:41.050
You know what really terrifies
the shit out of me?

23:41.085 --> 23:42.986
Hmm?

23:43.020 --> 23:44.220
Maple syrup.

23:44.254 --> 23:45.755
Maple syrup?

23:45.789 --> 23:48.091
Yeah, I can't eat
waffles or pancakes

23:48.125 --> 23:49.092
for fear of getting
that nasty shit

23:49.126 --> 23:50.426
all over my hands.

23:50.461 --> 23:52.395
Croissant too.

23:52.429 --> 23:54.197
It's the texture,
something about the...

23:54.231 --> 23:55.631
Wow.

23:55.666 --> 23:57.266
You know?

23:57.301 --> 23:59.669
I'm surprised that you like
the lady parts

23:59.703 --> 24:00.737
as much as you do.

24:00.771 --> 24:02.238
I love me the lady parts.

24:02.272 --> 24:03.573
Mind you, I don't think
I'd ever go

24:03.607 --> 24:05.742
for a vagina-flavored cupcake,

24:05.776 --> 24:07.777
but when you're down there
in the ladyness,

24:07.811 --> 24:10.513
you don't want that shit
to taste like ice cream.

24:10.547 --> 24:12.348
It's complicated.

24:12.383 --> 24:14.183
Oh, you're laughing.
That's good.

24:14.218 --> 24:17.120
That means you're not
plummeting to your death.

24:17.154 --> 24:19.088
I like that in a girl.

24:19.123 --> 24:21.057
I was thinking
about it, you know.

24:21.091 --> 24:22.358
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

24:22.393 --> 24:25.294
It'd be so easy to just
lean forward and let go.

24:25.329 --> 24:27.997
It would be.
It would be easy. Yeah.

24:28.032 --> 24:31.234
We could, uh...

24:31.268 --> 24:33.836
We could go together.

24:33.871 --> 24:37.473
Wow, that'd really
be something.

24:37.508 --> 24:41.544
Yeah. Like Butch and Sundance.

24:41.578 --> 24:43.479
Thelma and Louise.

24:43.514 --> 24:46.582
Tango and Cash.

24:46.617 --> 24:48.584
But somehow I don't think
it's the right ending

24:48.619 --> 24:50.486
for either one of us, Mia.

24:52.890 --> 24:54.724
Well, so where do we go
from here, then?

24:54.758 --> 24:57.460
Depends on where
you want to go, Mia.

24:57.494 --> 25:00.196
Honestly...

25:00.230 --> 25:03.199
I just want a do-over.

25:03.233 --> 25:04.801
Go back to being a kid.

25:04.835 --> 25:06.969
Me too.

25:07.004 --> 25:08.671
Well, not a kid, exactly,

25:08.705 --> 25:10.173
but I would like to go back
to '94.

25:10.207 --> 25:12.308
- That was a good year.
- Why?

25:12.342 --> 25:17.046
Because I met Karen.
Then Becca was born.

25:17.081 --> 25:19.082
It was the year
that changed my life.

25:19.116 --> 25:20.683
Mm.

25:20.717 --> 25:22.718
Plus, no Internet,
cell phones, texting,

25:22.753 --> 25:24.187
tweeting, twatting,
twittering...

25:24.221 --> 25:25.555
- The fucking dark ages.
- Yeah!

25:25.589 --> 25:28.591
Movies were a buck.
Gas was ten cents a gallon.

25:28.625 --> 25:30.593
Blow jobs were free.

25:30.627 --> 25:32.495
Speaking of which,
Clinton was in the White House,

25:32.529 --> 25:34.464
Nirvana was on the radio.

25:34.498 --> 25:36.432
And I had yet to fuck up
the best thing

25:36.467 --> 25:38.768
that ever happened to me.

25:44.741 --> 25:46.542
You know what we need
to do, Mia...

25:46.577 --> 25:48.211
What's that?

25:48.245 --> 25:51.981
We need to forgive
our fucking selves.

25:52.015 --> 25:54.350
You understand?

25:54.384 --> 25:58.187
Nobody's gonna do that for us.

25:58.222 --> 26:02.024
What do you think?

26:02.059 --> 26:03.893
Deal?

26:03.927 --> 26:07.430
Deal.

26:12.503 --> 26:13.769
It's a nice view,

26:13.804 --> 26:17.106
but do you think we might
go back inside now?

26:17.141 --> 26:19.675
I'm... I'm scared...

26:21.478 --> 26:23.146
And I don't like to shit myself

26:23.180 --> 26:25.148
in front of a lady.

26:25.182 --> 26:27.517
Okay.

26:30.787 --> 26:32.755
- Hey.
- Oh.

26:35.125 --> 26:36.359
I'm not kidding.

26:39.029 --> 26:40.696
Now I'm feeling dizzy.
I'm gonna head back to my room.

26:40.731 --> 26:44.767
No, no, no, no, no.
Let's go this way.

26:44.801 --> 26:47.003
Take a nap.

26:47.037 --> 26:48.604
Uhh!

26:51.141 --> 26:55.645
- Jesus. Oh...
- Hey.

26:55.679 --> 26:58.781
What are you doing here?

27:03.587 --> 27:06.789
Oh...

27:13.430 --> 27:17.567
Hey, check it out.

27:17.601 --> 27:18.668
Dude, that's awesome.

27:18.702 --> 27:20.169
Send it to me, yeah.

27:20.204 --> 27:22.638
- Playtime's over, ladies.
- Oh, no.

27:22.673 --> 27:27.343
No, no. Go play
amongst yourselves.
