WEBVTT

00:05.914 --> 00:07.614
Previously on Masters Of Sex...

00:07.615 --> 00:09.482
We began discussing
a potential investor,

00:09.483 --> 00:11.918
Mrs. Johnson and I immediately agreed

00:11.919 --> 00:13.219
that you were the right man for the job.

00:13.220 --> 00:15.924
I'm interested in a fragrance
that says "I want you.

00:15.925 --> 00:19.160
Go to bed with me, you
can't live without me."

00:19.161 --> 00:21.194
- Uh, you want to...?
- To enlist.

00:21.195 --> 00:22.397
I cannot have our son come home

00:22.398 --> 00:25.032
in a flag-draped coffin.

00:25.033 --> 00:27.534
I-I don't...
I don't want to do that.

00:27.535 --> 00:29.068
It's in your mom's book.

00:29.069 --> 00:31.371
Jesus, don't be such a prick tease.

00:34.008 --> 00:35.909
He showed me three apartments.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.377
That is a really big step.

00:37.378 --> 00:39.379
But if I don't do
something about this now,

00:39.380 --> 00:41.414
then that's all it will
ever be, just talk.

00:41.415 --> 00:43.082
You can walk, too, Libby.

00:43.083 --> 00:44.083
Walk away, I mean.

00:44.084 --> 00:45.287
Walk away from my life?

00:45.288 --> 00:47.154
- Like you?
- It's Joy.

00:47.155 --> 00:49.556
And they're calling it
a brain aneurysm.

00:49.557 --> 00:50.590
You need to come work for me.

00:50.591 --> 00:52.025
But I'm happy where I am.

00:52.026 --> 00:53.493
Come where you're wanted, Barton.

00:53.494 --> 00:54.930
Where you're respected.

00:54.931 --> 00:57.665
What's the story?
Married, single?

00:57.666 --> 00:59.401
Uh, married, yes.

"During the first 35 years
of the 20th century,

01:52.020 --> 01:53.455
the publishing houses of America

01:53.456 --> 01:57.455
printed more than a 1/5 of
a million different books.

01:57.959 --> 01:59.928
Most of them were deadly dull.

01:59.929 --> 02:02.096
Many were financial failures.

02:02.097 --> 02:05.900
So why did I have the temerity
to write another book?

02:05.901 --> 02:08.970
And after I had written
it, why should you bother

02:08.971 --> 02:13.141
to read 'How To Win Friends
And Influence People'?"

02:21.883 --> 02:24.552
May I help you find something?

02:24.553 --> 02:25.986
Um, uh, yeah.

02:25.987 --> 02:30.090
I-I was looking for,
uh, "Giles Goat-Boy."

02:30.091 --> 02:32.225
You're in for quite
a treat with this one.

02:32.226 --> 02:35.630
Prepare to have your notions of
the American novel torn asunder.

02:40.969 --> 02:42.102
Excuse me.

02:42.103 --> 02:44.639
I couldn't help but
overhear your conversation,

02:44.640 --> 02:46.173
and I'm quite certain

02:46.174 --> 02:48.109
you're not buying the
book you really wanted.

02:48.110 --> 02:49.644
Buzz off.

02:56.151 --> 02:57.617
Is there something
I can do for you?

02:57.618 --> 03:00.954
Because you've been browsing
for quite a while now.

03:00.955 --> 03:03.056
In fact, there is
something you can do.

03:03.057 --> 03:05.525
Three months ago, my book
"Human Sexual Response"

03:05.526 --> 03:07.028
was in your front window.

03:07.029 --> 03:10.064
Now it is tucked away
behind reference books

03:10.065 --> 03:12.932
in a part of your store that
gets very little foot traffic

03:12.933 --> 03:14.367
and has only got three copies.

03:14.368 --> 03:17.403
Look, if you had a
question about your book,

03:17.404 --> 03:20.340
why not just walk over
to the register and ask?

03:20.341 --> 03:22.877
Because while you
were scaring customers off,

03:22.878 --> 03:25.279
I was working and observing.

03:25.280 --> 03:28.281
And it's clear to me that you
would sell far more copies--

03:28.282 --> 03:31.451
People who have bought
your book tend to call ahead

03:31.452 --> 03:33.221
instead of buying it off the shelves.

03:33.222 --> 03:37.491
So we either have it waiting
for them behind the counter,

03:37.492 --> 03:39.026
or we ship it out.

03:39.027 --> 03:42.596
Now that we settled that,
buy a book or leave.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.964
In fact, Dale Carnegie would
be an excellent choice,

03:44.965 --> 03:46.232
since I'm inclined to believe

03:46.233 --> 03:49.270
that winning friends is
not your strong suit.

03:58.279 --> 04:00.347
Uh...

04:00.348 --> 04:01.916
Where's-- where's your mother?

04:01.917 --> 04:03.984
She's next door.

04:03.985 --> 04:05.253
Helping the Edleys.

04:10.992 --> 04:12.927
Are you gonna go next door, too?

04:12.928 --> 04:13.894
I will.

04:13.895 --> 04:17.894
Not now, but... soon.

04:18.033 --> 04:20.435
I need to stay here to look after you.

04:20.435 --> 04:22.937
So...

04:26.207 --> 04:27.175
Go to bed.

04:41.289 --> 04:42.656
Tessa?

04:42.657 --> 04:44.624
Have you seen my letter from Henry?

04:44.625 --> 04:46.628
I could have sworn I left it
right here on the nightstand.

04:46.629 --> 04:48.095
You did.

04:48.096 --> 04:51.632
Now I'm putting it back
on the nightstand.

04:51.633 --> 04:54.067
So you just--
you took it without asking?

04:54.068 --> 04:55.134
You were asleep.

04:55.135 --> 04:57.637
Besides, you take my
strawberry-meringue lipstick.

04:57.638 --> 04:59.641
As if I would want such a thing.

04:59.642 --> 05:01.209
All right.

05:03.578 --> 05:04.646
So, what do you think?

05:06.114 --> 05:09.016
He doesn't sound good, does he?

05:09.017 --> 05:11.386
The part where he talks
about not feeling well.

05:11.387 --> 05:14.288
That rash and sweating, fever, nausea.

05:14.289 --> 05:16.089
It's 120 degrees there.

05:16.090 --> 05:18.624
Can't you just focus on the part
where he says he found a dog?

05:18.625 --> 05:20.226
Henry always wanted a dog.

05:20.227 --> 05:22.061
"The rain never stops.

05:22.062 --> 05:24.263
And since I chose the wrong MOS,

05:24.264 --> 05:26.501
I keep pulling guard
duty 10 hours a night."

05:26.502 --> 05:28.001
What is MOS?

05:28.002 --> 05:29.135
And what are they guarding?

05:29.136 --> 05:31.504
It's the base.
It's like a little city.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.339
"If I get transferred
to the motor pool,

05:33.340 --> 05:35.210
I'll mostly just be ordering parts,

05:35.211 --> 05:38.378
and occasionally will go along on convoys

05:38.379 --> 05:40.415
to deliver ammo and other supplies."

05:42.450 --> 05:45.351
Do you think that
I could call somebody?

05:45.352 --> 05:46.654
Call about what?

05:46.655 --> 05:48.188
About Henry.

05:48.189 --> 05:50.325
And I told you-- I didn't
take your lipstick.

05:51.626 --> 05:53.392
Can you just drive me to school?

05:53.393 --> 05:55.396
I'm always late when I stay over here.

05:56.664 --> 05:59.432
This was a very
respectable run, Dr. Masters.

05:59.433 --> 06:01.569
15,000 copies is nothing to sniff at.

06:01.570 --> 06:02.970
That's it?

06:02.971 --> 06:04.871
One edition, and--
and our book is done?

06:04.872 --> 06:06.172
How can that be?

06:06.173 --> 06:08.474
We at Little, Brown
feel we will have reached

06:08.475 --> 06:10.143
a saturation point in sales.

06:10.144 --> 06:11.110
Everyone interested in the book

06:11.111 --> 06:12.879
will have likely already purchased it.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.480
What about word of mouth?

06:14.481 --> 06:16.315
Don't you expect that to boost sales?

06:16.316 --> 06:18.151
In fact, I have
a sense that the book

06:18.152 --> 06:19.485
is actually gaining momentum.

06:19.486 --> 06:20.488
You sense it?

06:20.489 --> 06:22.022
Yes.

06:22.023 --> 06:26.193
I've been doing some of my
own research in the field,

06:26.194 --> 06:29.297
where I have seen that
demand for the book is,

06:29.298 --> 06:31.031
if anything, uh, growing.

06:31.032 --> 06:33.499
Well, we are getting
calls almost every week

06:33.500 --> 06:36.135
from medical schools interested
in using it as a textbook.

06:36.136 --> 06:37.904
But not just as textbooks.

06:37.905 --> 06:40.606
The general public has a real
appetite for this material.

06:40.607 --> 06:42.408
Many of them are simply embarrassed

06:42.409 --> 06:43.643
to be seen buying it.

06:43.644 --> 06:45.613
If it's a
question of perception,

06:45.614 --> 06:48.415
perhaps we should change the perception.

06:48.416 --> 06:50.950
Try to get it discussed in
more populist forums--

06:50.951 --> 06:53.152
like women's magazines, for example.

06:53.153 --> 06:55.888
A favorable article or two
isn't gonna make the difference.

06:55.889 --> 06:57.557
As we said from the
start, the only real way

06:57.558 --> 06:59.458
to get readers comfortable with this work

06:59.459 --> 07:01.896
is to get you two out in
front of the rank and file,

07:01.897 --> 07:03.096
the regular folk.

07:03.097 --> 07:04.931
Oh, so we'll go out in
front of the general public,

07:04.932 --> 07:06.465
and you can prepare for a second printing.

07:06.466 --> 07:08.434
But the only way a
second printing is happening

07:08.435 --> 07:09.502
is if the book sells out.

07:09.503 --> 07:11.204
And the only way for the book to sell out

07:11.205 --> 07:12.905
involves a lot more work from you--

07:12.906 --> 07:15.241
more interviews, more lectures,
personal appearances.

07:15.242 --> 07:17.610
Heck, maybe a whole tour of the Midwest.

07:17.611 --> 07:21.147
I cannot put my neck on the line
with Little, Brown headquarters

07:21.148 --> 07:23.651
if you aren't willing to get out
there and pound the pavement.

07:23.652 --> 07:27.651
So, are you two willing to
take this show on the road?

07:28.156 --> 07:29.222
We are. Absolutely.

07:29.223 --> 07:31.125
We'll have to
look at our schedules.

07:44.072 --> 07:47.574
Do you like it?

07:47.575 --> 07:49.476
Mm-hmm.

07:49.477 --> 07:52.646
Tell me.

07:52.647 --> 07:54.616
I like it.

07:58.152 --> 08:00.387
Oh, but--

08:00.388 --> 08:02.490
But what?

08:06.961 --> 08:09.263
The truth, Margaret.

08:09.264 --> 08:13.264
I just want the
kind of sex where...

08:16.938 --> 08:19.107
So we should
keep that appointment.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.243
And Jo?

08:23.244 --> 08:25.280
What do we tell them about Jo?

08:25.281 --> 08:27.981
This is about us, Graham.

08:27.982 --> 08:30.484
Just us.

08:30.485 --> 08:32.485
Ann Arbor is a 10-hour drive.

08:32.486 --> 08:34.587
Betty, we're gonna need
you to follow up with--

08:34.587 --> 08:36.524
The Little, Brown man?
I'm on it.

08:36.525 --> 08:37.991
Hello, hello.

08:37.991 --> 08:42.229
I'm afraid your Lambert Airport
delayed us with the luggage.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.562
Mr. Logan and company.

08:43.563 --> 08:45.564
Allow me to introduce you
to my research assistants.

08:45.565 --> 08:47.500
This is Mary Lynn, Mary Ann, and Trudy.

08:47.501 --> 08:49.602
They've just flown in from New
York with our fragrance samples,

08:49.603 --> 08:51.940
and we are ready to get
straight to work--

08:51.941 --> 08:54.374
after you sign Mary Lynn's book.

08:54.375 --> 08:57.378
All she's talked about since
she stepped on the tarmac.

08:57.379 --> 09:00.480
It would be
an honor, Dr. Masters.

09:00.481 --> 09:03.483
I'm something of a scientist myself.

09:03.484 --> 09:05.551
Oh. What kind of science?

09:05.552 --> 09:06.888
Astrology.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.224
Uh, I don't seem to have a--

09:10.225 --> 09:12.292
I come prepared.

09:12.293 --> 09:13.327
I'm a Virgo.

09:18.666 --> 09:21.402
Uh, Mary Lynn... was it?

09:23.471 --> 09:27.471
"To a fellow intellectual

09:28.409 --> 09:32.279
and woman of science."

09:32.280 --> 09:33.379
And you should know, ladies,

09:33.380 --> 09:35.348
that Mrs. Johnson is the role model

09:35.349 --> 09:38.286
for all young women of
intelligence and ambition.

09:38.287 --> 09:41.221
Degree in psychology, expert in her field,

09:41.222 --> 09:43.255
and she is also eminently gracious.

09:43.256 --> 09:44.325
Being an Aquarius.

09:44.326 --> 09:45.292
Betty!

09:45.293 --> 09:46.627
Uh, is the exam room ready

09:46.628 --> 09:50.063
for Mr. Logan and his backup singers?

09:50.064 --> 09:51.399
Come this way, girls.

09:51.400 --> 09:54.635
I can't make any promises
about the acoustics.

10:06.280 --> 10:09.182
Is Mrs. Edley a turnip?

10:09.183 --> 10:11.319
Johnny keeps saying she's a vegetable.

10:13.221 --> 10:17.189
But vegetables don't sit
in wheelchairs or get dressed.

10:17.190 --> 10:20.561
First of all,
Mrs. Edley is not a vegetable.

10:20.562 --> 10:24.561
And her husband helps her get
dressed, or her caretaker.

10:25.633 --> 10:28.067
But she can't wear
pants anymore, can she?

10:28.068 --> 10:29.335
Of course she can.

10:29.336 --> 10:31.172
Mrs. Edley can wear whatever she wants.

10:31.173 --> 10:34.207
But why is Mrs. Edley like that?

10:34.208 --> 10:38.208
Something went
wrong with her brain.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.950
Can that happen to you?

10:46.020 --> 10:47.554
No.

10:47.555 --> 10:50.090
No, of course not.

10:50.091 --> 10:51.324
I mean, um...

10:51.325 --> 10:53.226
It won't happen to me.

10:53.227 --> 10:55.495
How do you know?

10:55.496 --> 10:58.266
Is daddy gonna have to
dress you every day?

10:58.267 --> 11:00.967
Honey...

11:00.968 --> 11:02.102
I am fine.

11:02.103 --> 11:04.504
I am completely fine.

11:04.505 --> 11:07.107
Nothing is gonna happen to me.

11:07.108 --> 11:09.976
Okay.

11:21.089 --> 11:23.923
How about the
week with Columbus Day?

11:23.924 --> 11:25.624
Mm, Tessa's
off school that week,

11:25.625 --> 11:27.226
which actually makes it worse.

11:27.227 --> 11:29.428
When she's in school, at least
I know where she is all day.

11:29.429 --> 11:31.030
The week after, then.

11:31.031 --> 11:33.632
That is George's
yearly fishing trip,

11:33.633 --> 11:35.634
so I'll have Tessa with me then, too.

11:35.635 --> 11:37.371
Well, Tessa can stay with Libby.

11:37.372 --> 11:40.607
I impose on Libby enough.

11:40.608 --> 11:43.410
So, when exactly
are you available?

11:43.411 --> 11:47.013
I hear a phone ringing somewhere.

11:47.014 --> 11:48.381
Not here.

11:48.382 --> 11:51.552
I'm just trying
to be practical here, Bill.

11:51.553 --> 11:55.122
We can't just drop
everything and hit the road.

11:55.123 --> 11:56.355
We have patients to see.

11:56.356 --> 11:58.491
We have a new investor
breathing down our necks.

11:58.492 --> 12:00.159
Oh, Dan Logan and The Shirelles?

12:00.160 --> 12:01.329
They are not a priority.

12:01.330 --> 12:05.165
Yes, but other things are.

12:05.166 --> 12:09.069
I got another letter
from Henry last night.

12:09.070 --> 12:11.604
And I need to get to the bottom
of what's happened to him.

12:11.605 --> 12:12.872
What's happened to him?

12:12.873 --> 12:14.976
Yes, he says that he's sick--

12:14.977 --> 12:16.209
in his letters.

12:16.210 --> 12:19.546
Sweating, fever, nausea.

12:19.547 --> 12:21.113
Oh, well, those are
all common reactions

12:21.114 --> 12:22.414
to a tropical climate.

12:22.415 --> 12:24.483
Malaria being
another common reaction.

12:24.484 --> 12:25.484
Well, it's possible.

12:25.485 --> 12:27.119
But it's more likely a stomach bug...

12:27.120 --> 12:29.522
or a reaction to anti-malarial pills.

12:29.523 --> 12:32.458
He could have a mild
case of gastroenteritis.

12:32.459 --> 12:33.425
Food poisoning.

12:33.426 --> 12:35.194
The beginnings of ulcerative colitis.

12:35.195 --> 12:37.463
Even a bad sunburn could
produce a similar reaction.

12:37.464 --> 12:39.333
The symptoms are too general
to say anything definitively,

12:39.334 --> 12:41.368
but I wouldn't worry.

12:41.369 --> 12:43.569
I'll stop
worrying as soon as I know.

12:43.570 --> 12:45.571
As for now, let's just
be smart about work.

12:45.572 --> 12:49.277
If we have to tour the Midwest,
we should divide and conquer.

12:49.278 --> 12:50.410
Divide?

12:50.411 --> 12:52.077
What-- you mean tour separately?

12:52.078 --> 12:53.514
Yes. You can
take the further venues,

12:53.515 --> 12:55.482
and I'll take Chesterfield.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.216
Chesterfield is 20 minutes away.

12:57.217 --> 12:59.051
Fine. Then
you take Chesterfield,

12:59.052 --> 13:00.452
and I will hold down the fort here.

13:00.453 --> 13:02.256
Have you read our book, Virginia?

13:02.257 --> 13:04.391
It's by Masters and Johnson.

13:04.392 --> 13:07.628
A collaborative effort by two
writers, one male, one female.

13:07.629 --> 13:11.198
So we're perceived as a team because...

13:11.199 --> 13:13.200
we're a team.

13:13.201 --> 13:17.071
I'm just trying
to be practical, Bill.

13:20.041 --> 13:22.577
"I will quote many
great men in this book,

13:22.578 --> 13:26.045
and one of the greatest,
John D Rockefeller, said,

13:26.046 --> 13:27.915
'The ability to deal with people

13:27.916 --> 13:31.384
is as purchasable a commodity
as sugar or coffee.'

13:31.385 --> 13:33.018
And that ability to deal with people

13:33.019 --> 13:36.522
comes down to one all-important
law of human conduct.

13:36.523 --> 13:40.524
If we obey this law, we shall
almost never get into trouble."

13:41.095 --> 13:42.530
I'm turning in now.

13:42.531 --> 13:43.530
Good night.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.233
Yes.

13:46.234 --> 13:47.301
Good night, Lib.

13:59.580 --> 14:03.116
"In fact, if obeyed,

14:03.117 --> 14:07.520
this will bring us countless
friends and constant happiness.

14:07.521 --> 14:09.422
The law is this--

14:09.423 --> 14:13.423
always make the other
person feel important."

14:17.298 --> 14:19.331
Your wife is going to be thrilled.

14:19.332 --> 14:21.235
You made an excellent choice.

14:21.236 --> 14:24.504
Especially for a fur virgin.

14:24.505 --> 14:28.208
It's just a term we use

14:28.209 --> 14:30.344
for a man who's never bought a fur before.

14:30.345 --> 14:33.013
Yes, well...

14:33.014 --> 14:35.649
I'm not prone to extravagant gestures.

14:35.650 --> 14:39.152
But sometimes it's important to, um...

14:39.153 --> 14:42.290
to demonstrate how-- how
much you appreciate someone.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.964
And...

14:50.965 --> 14:55.402
I'd like to thank you for
your assistance today...

14:55.403 --> 14:57.571
Elsa.

15:06.113 --> 15:08.347
Why aren't you dressed?

15:08.348 --> 15:10.215
Is that another letter from Henry?

15:10.216 --> 15:12.184
No, it's not another
letter from Henry.

15:12.185 --> 15:13.587
Well, then
why are you hiding it?

15:13.588 --> 15:15.222
What happened?

15:17.258 --> 15:19.224
I got suspended from school.

15:19.225 --> 15:21.195
For cutting class...
starting today.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.631
Feel better?

15:31.238 --> 15:34.140
Pay attention to what she tells you.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.243
Okay.

15:44.485 --> 15:48.555
She's just going to be
alphabetizing files...

15:48.556 --> 15:50.524
and helping with the rolodex cards.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.655
What's that?

16:28.262 --> 16:29.929
I don't understand.

16:29.930 --> 16:32.233
Just-- just open it, Virginia.

16:39.974 --> 16:41.274
Do you like it?

16:41.275 --> 16:45.078
I-I don't know what to say.

16:45.079 --> 16:49.015
Do you know what John Dewey said?

16:49.016 --> 16:50.918
"Every great advance in science

16:50.919 --> 16:55.255
has issued from a new
audacity of imagination."

16:55.256 --> 16:57.991
Uh, sorry. John... Dewey?

16:57.992 --> 17:00.894
My point, Virginia, is...

17:00.895 --> 17:04.895
you have been that and more.

17:05.900 --> 17:10.170
You have been audacious, tireless,

17:10.171 --> 17:14.574
dedicated, and brilliant.

17:14.575 --> 17:18.575
And it's only fitting that you
should have a token of...

17:19.313 --> 17:23.016
well, of-- of my appreciation...

17:23.017 --> 17:24.516
of you.

17:24.517 --> 17:26.050
10:00. First victim's up.

17:26.051 --> 17:28.387
Betty, there is a
reason knocking was invented!

17:28.387 --> 17:30.222
Betty, uh, what about Barton?

17:30.223 --> 17:31.425
Out for the day...

17:31.426 --> 17:34.427
as planned.

17:41.635 --> 17:45.405
You can try it on later.

17:45.406 --> 17:47.940
Of course, I've
followed all your triumphs.

17:47.941 --> 17:49.074
Graham will tell you.

17:49.075 --> 17:50.943
Any mention of
you two in the papers

17:50.944 --> 17:52.945
she clips and puts by my morning coffee.

17:53.980 --> 17:55.583
Well, we do go way back, Margaret.

17:55.584 --> 17:58.051
And you do look wonderful.

17:58.052 --> 18:00.452
She's certainly not
the woman I met a year ago.

18:00.453 --> 18:02.490
You've blossomed like a flower, Magpie.

18:04.058 --> 18:05.457
I'd like to think
it was because of me

18:05.458 --> 18:06.625
that's made a difference.

18:06.626 --> 18:09.495
But what really happened
is, she's met herself.

18:09.496 --> 18:11.597
Sounds silly put that way.

18:11.598 --> 18:14.568
Well, it doesn't matter
how it sounds if it's the truth.

18:14.569 --> 18:16.169
Aww.

18:16.170 --> 18:19.338
Graham is teaching me not
to care what people think.

18:19.339 --> 18:21.308
He didn't understand why I took pains

18:21.309 --> 18:23.343
to come on Barton's day off.

18:23.344 --> 18:24.643
Well, it's been--

18:24.644 --> 18:26.178
it's been three years since the divorce.

18:26.179 --> 18:28.080
So, Barton is aware
that you've remarried?

18:28.081 --> 18:29.183
Oh, no.

18:29.184 --> 18:32.452
Graham and I aren't--
I mean, maybe one day.

18:32.453 --> 18:35.121
So, you're, uh, living together?

18:35.122 --> 18:38.625
Yes, and enjoying
each other day by day.

18:38.626 --> 18:40.561
My old self
would be scandalized.

18:40.562 --> 18:42.095
My new self is, um...

18:42.096 --> 18:43.161
Following your path.

18:43.162 --> 18:44.396
Yes.

18:44.397 --> 18:46.233
Are you familiar with the
works of William Glasser?

18:46.234 --> 18:48.234
Reality therapy?

18:48.235 --> 18:51.504
Graham and I met in a workshop, and...

18:51.505 --> 18:55.475
Reality therapy
is about personal choice,

18:55.476 --> 18:58.577
personal responsibility,
personal transformation.

18:58.578 --> 19:00.879
And it's helped me not be afraid

19:00.880 --> 19:02.583
to tell Graham what I need...

19:02.584 --> 19:05.118
um, including in bed.

19:05.119 --> 19:06.620
Which brings us to you.

19:06.621 --> 19:10.456
I, um, a li-- I'm a little
quick off the starting block.

19:10.457 --> 19:11.624
What am I saying?

19:11.625 --> 19:13.327
- No euphemisms.
- Right.

19:13.328 --> 19:17.363
I have been
ejaculating prematurely.

19:17.364 --> 19:20.067
You can help
with that, can't you?

19:20.068 --> 19:23.903
And for the two of you, sex is?

19:23.904 --> 19:26.405
It depends. Sometimes
I can last a minute or two,

19:26.406 --> 19:29.009
and sometimes it's over
before I enter her.

19:29.010 --> 19:32.211
And does she
physically stimulate you

19:32.212 --> 19:33.579
in any way prior to intercourse?

19:33.580 --> 19:35.049
There's no need.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.650
Once we begin, I'm--
I'm ready to go.

19:37.651 --> 19:40.520
A little too ready.

19:40.521 --> 19:42.555
And Margaret?

19:42.556 --> 19:44.558
It can take me a while.

19:44.559 --> 19:48.558
And Graham doesn't
satisfy you in other ways?

19:49.296 --> 19:51.998
He wants to. He tries to.

19:51.999 --> 19:54.901
But I want it to happen with us together,

19:54.902 --> 19:56.103
looking into each other's eyes.

19:58.105 --> 20:00.105
You think I've read too
many romance novels.

20:02.143 --> 20:06.579
Well, simultaneous
orgasm is a romantic notion,

20:06.580 --> 20:08.381
but it's not the norm.

20:08.382 --> 20:11.883
But it's happened for
us before, in the beginning.

20:11.884 --> 20:14.987
And I think with help,
we could get back to that.

20:14.988 --> 20:16.657
Is this-- I don't know.
Is this what you do?

20:16.658 --> 20:20.657
Is this-- you rehash the past?

20:21.295 --> 20:24.398
Because I don't particularly
like to look back.

20:25.899 --> 20:28.266
"What are you going to do about
your life beginning today?"

20:28.267 --> 20:30.571
Is what Glasser would
have us ask ourselves.

20:30.572 --> 20:33.940
The only thing that matters
is right now.

20:33.941 --> 20:38.111
The past may hold some answers.

20:38.112 --> 20:40.980
Well, I've spent most of my life

20:40.981 --> 20:42.547
trying to make my two ex-wives

20:42.548 --> 20:44.916
and a handful of girlfriends happy.

20:44.917 --> 20:46.451
And looking back on it now,

20:46.452 --> 20:48.422
I don't-- I don't even
think I liked them.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.258
But I-I like this one...

20:52.259 --> 20:55.462
because she doesn't want
to look backwards, either.

20:55.463 --> 20:59.565
Now, if you have some
practical advice to offer--

20:59.566 --> 21:00.900
We do.

21:00.901 --> 21:02.234
Our treatment involves, uh,

21:02.235 --> 21:05.572
a system of physical
reconditioning that allows a man

21:05.573 --> 21:09.572
to regain control of his
ejaculatory response.

21:09.943 --> 21:14.213
But if simultaneity
weren't always the goal?

21:14.214 --> 21:17.917
It's only good
when it's us together.

21:17.918 --> 21:19.420
That's a tall order.

21:19.421 --> 21:23.420
In the beginning,
oh, our bodies fit together.

21:23.924 --> 21:27.293
We-- we were attuned to
each other so acutely.

21:27.294 --> 21:29.530
The pleasure was more than physical.

21:29.531 --> 21:30.997
It was...

21:30.998 --> 21:33.266
you'll laugh, but spiritual.

21:33.267 --> 21:35.468
I've never had that before.

21:35.469 --> 21:38.072
I don't want to give
up on having it again.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.477
Uh, Dr. Scully!

21:44.478 --> 21:46.111
That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

21:46.112 --> 21:48.146
Oh, what are you
doing here on your day off?

21:48.147 --> 21:49.314
I'm here to see a patient.

21:49.315 --> 21:50.549
Oh, no, you're not.

21:50.550 --> 21:51.583
Uh, not in my book.

21:51.584 --> 21:53.554
And my book's the only one that counts.

21:53.555 --> 21:55.388
So scoot. Out.

21:55.389 --> 21:57.357
Barton.

21:59.093 --> 22:00.194
Margaret.

22:00.195 --> 22:02.428
Hello.

22:03.531 --> 22:06.966
Are-- are you here to see me?

22:06.967 --> 22:08.367
N-no.

22:08.368 --> 22:09.368
Actually...

22:09.369 --> 22:10.969
Margaret, um...

22:10.970 --> 22:11.970
So, what happens next?

22:11.971 --> 22:13.240
We-- we switch?

22:13.241 --> 22:15.608
Oh, I-I see.

22:15.609 --> 22:18.111
Uh...

22:18.112 --> 22:20.279
You must be...

22:20.280 --> 22:22.882
This is Graham Pennington.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.251
This is my husband, Barton Scully.

22:25.252 --> 22:26.985
- Oh, your ex-husband.
- Oh, yeah.

22:26.986 --> 22:28.520
I say it sometimes, too.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.023
"My wife."

22:31.625 --> 22:33.526
Well, I'm keeping you all

22:33.527 --> 22:35.963
from something very important, I'm sure.

22:35.964 --> 22:38.064
So, uh, I'll just, uh...

22:40.367 --> 22:41.635
I'll just...

22:47.407 --> 22:50.476
Oh, his pants
were hanging off him.

22:50.477 --> 22:52.645
Did you see? Has he been sick?

22:52.646 --> 22:53.578
He's fine.

22:53.579 --> 22:55.013
Why has he stopped wearing hats?

22:55.014 --> 22:56.383
He's prone to colds, you know.

22:56.384 --> 22:58.184
Margaret.

22:58.185 --> 23:00.953
I'm-- I'm sorry.

23:00.954 --> 23:02.989
How long has it been?

23:02.990 --> 23:05.625
Since we signed the papers.

23:05.626 --> 23:07.459
Barton insisted we cut off contact.

23:07.460 --> 23:09.561
I thought he was being selfish
and protecting himself,

23:09.562 --> 23:11.365
and then I--

23:11.366 --> 23:15.568
I realized it was his way of
letting me make a new life.

23:15.569 --> 23:17.871
Which you seem to have done.

23:17.872 --> 23:20.406
Have I?

23:20.407 --> 23:24.544
Falling in love with another
man where sex is...

23:24.545 --> 23:27.347
Well, Graham and Barton
have very different issues.

23:28.982 --> 23:31.652
Premature ejaculation is
not an indication of...

23:35.923 --> 23:40.092
lack of attraction to the opposite sex.

23:40.093 --> 23:42.461
So you know.

23:42.462 --> 23:45.031
I've known for some time.

23:45.032 --> 23:48.067
Two men, Bill.

23:48.068 --> 23:50.003
Two men with sexual dysfunctions.

23:50.004 --> 23:51.571
I...

23:51.572 --> 23:52.971
I think it's got to be me.

23:52.972 --> 23:54.908
Margaret, I'm sure Graham

23:54.909 --> 23:59.111
could reassure you that he desires women.

23:59.112 --> 24:00.445
Well, that would require him

24:00.446 --> 24:02.616
knowing the truth, why
my marriage ended...

24:02.617 --> 24:05.151
Why I insist on face-to-face sex...

24:05.152 --> 24:06.920
Why I can't do anything to him orally...

24:06.921 --> 24:09.488
Why I need him to see me, my body.

24:09.489 --> 24:10.989
Margaret, I understand your need

24:10.990 --> 24:12.359
to protect Barton's privacy,

24:12.360 --> 24:17.834
but surely you can tell
Graham in confidence.

24:19.967 --> 24:22.069
Have you told anyone?

24:24.938 --> 24:28.875
I told him some version
of what I told Vivian--

24:28.876 --> 24:32.478
that-- that I had...

24:32.479 --> 24:34.013
other men...

24:34.014 --> 24:35.547
That the divorce was my fault.

24:35.548 --> 24:39.549
And as a result, my own daughter
wants nothing to do with me.

24:40.087 --> 24:43.956
But I tell myself, in time,
Vivian will forgive me.

24:43.957 --> 24:45.991
But if she knows her
father sleeps with men,

24:45.992 --> 24:47.361
Barton will lose her forever.

24:47.362 --> 24:50.529
But it haunts me,
carrying around a secret

24:50.530 --> 24:55.525
that doesn't belong to me
and isn't mine to tell.

24:57.504 --> 25:00.071
I can't see
anything to worry about.

25:00.072 --> 25:01.275
A little breakthrough bleeding

25:01.276 --> 25:03.976
is entirely normal with the pill.

25:03.977 --> 25:05.478
You're sure?

25:05.479 --> 25:07.980
It's-- it's not the sign of a--

25:07.981 --> 25:09.983
a blood clot or a vascular problem?

25:09.984 --> 25:12.118
That's an odd question.

25:12.119 --> 25:13.451
It's just, um...

25:13.452 --> 25:16.323
my neighbor had a stroke--
or an aneurysm.

25:16.324 --> 25:19.492
I'm not exactly sure
what the difference is.

25:19.493 --> 25:23.493
And it's, um, awful.

25:24.231 --> 25:27.066
I guess I just got frightened.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.900
Have I made you come in for nothing?

25:28.901 --> 25:30.969
It's no problem, really.

25:30.970 --> 25:33.373
I mean, working here has been a refuge.

25:33.374 --> 25:36.375
Well, most days.

25:36.376 --> 25:39.111
And bringing new life into the world...

25:39.112 --> 25:40.180
Nothing beats that.

25:40.181 --> 25:41.881
Yes, of course.

25:41.882 --> 25:43.617
Well, with all the trouble I had,

25:43.618 --> 25:46.385
I-I know exactly what that's like.

25:46.386 --> 25:50.089
You know, that's
why, uh, I was surprised

25:50.090 --> 25:52.390
when you said you were on the pill.

25:52.391 --> 25:54.895
I mean, all the single
girls are on the pill now.

25:54.896 --> 25:56.262
Married ones, too.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.029
Many with boyfriends on the side.

25:58.030 --> 25:59.564
Oh!

25:59.565 --> 26:01.166
In my job, you see everything, of course.

26:01.167 --> 26:05.236
I was having cramps, and
it helps keep my cycle regular.

26:05.237 --> 26:06.538
I'm surprised

26:06.539 --> 26:08.542
that you couldn't talk
to Bill about all this.

26:08.543 --> 26:12.411
I think it's nicer
for a husband and wife

26:12.412 --> 26:15.082
to maintain a little mystery in that area.

26:15.083 --> 26:16.350
Don't you agree?

26:19.586 --> 26:22.055
For your mom, if it's
a business card like this,

26:22.056 --> 26:24.523
it's okay to staple.

26:24.524 --> 26:27.093
And voilã.

26:27.094 --> 26:28.894
She's a rebel, your mom.

26:28.895 --> 26:31.964
She's a guard at a labor camp.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.231
Oh, she's doing the right thing

26:33.232 --> 26:34.466
making you come in here and work.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.868
When I got suspended, my
mom didn't even care,

26:36.869 --> 26:37.936
didn't even notice.

26:37.937 --> 26:40.374
And, believe me,
no good came from that.

26:40.375 --> 26:44.378
All right. For these, all caps,
last name, comma, first.

26:46.113 --> 26:48.147
So...

26:48.148 --> 26:50.584
She bring her boyfriends around here?

26:50.585 --> 26:52.051
My mom?

26:52.052 --> 26:53.186
What boyfriends?

26:53.187 --> 26:55.921
Come on. You've met them.

26:55.922 --> 26:57.590
Him.

26:57.591 --> 26:59.525
The latest one.

26:59.526 --> 27:00.959
I'm not so sure he's a keeper.

27:00.960 --> 27:04.197
Look at you, going
on a fishing expedition.

27:04.198 --> 27:06.065
What about you, huh?

27:06.066 --> 27:07.501
When do I get to meet your boyfriend?

27:08.935 --> 27:10.936
"International lubricants."

27:10.937 --> 27:15.141
See, this is why I can't bring
Matt anywhere near this place.

27:15.142 --> 27:16.474
Why can't these people

27:16.475 --> 27:18.943
just figure out this sex
stuff on their own?

27:18.944 --> 27:20.547
Well, thanks to your
mom, they don't have to,

27:20.548 --> 27:22.882
which is a big plus, trust me.

27:22.883 --> 27:25.383
In my day, people understood the
plumbing in their bathrooms

27:25.384 --> 27:27.285
better than their own ducts and pipes.

27:27.286 --> 27:29.287
What do you really need to know?

27:29.288 --> 27:30.424
As long as you're being careful.

27:30.425 --> 27:33.325
Oh, you know all about that, huh?

27:33.326 --> 27:35.995
You and Matt?

27:35.996 --> 27:39.131
Better than my mom.

27:39.132 --> 27:42.333
What Matt and I do won't leave
you with a crying Baby Lisa

27:42.334 --> 27:43.970
that keeps you up all night long.

28:21.441 --> 28:23.477
That's why I'm
calling you, Sergeant Ivey,

28:23.478 --> 28:27.246
because there isn't anybody else.

28:27.247 --> 28:28.279
Oh, I see. I see.

28:28.280 --> 28:29.649
So, once you reel them in,

28:29.650 --> 28:33.119
you have no interest in
any follow-up whatsoever?

28:33.120 --> 28:36.956
Despite sending boys 8,000
miles away into some jungle?

28:36.957 --> 28:38.457
Yes.

28:38.458 --> 28:40.159
Yes, I do see.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.561
And thank you not at all.

28:42.562 --> 28:45.031
So, we're ready in the testing room.

28:45.032 --> 28:46.165
Got 12 scents,

28:46.166 --> 28:47.866
six of which aren't even
commercially available yet.

28:47.867 --> 28:49.469
You're not listening to a
word of this, are you?

28:49.470 --> 28:52.238
I'm sorry. I...

28:52.239 --> 28:53.973
I have a sick child.

28:53.974 --> 28:55.141
Hm.

28:55.142 --> 28:56.409
So you need to go home?

28:56.410 --> 28:59.545
No. I have a
sick child in Vietnam.

28:59.546 --> 29:01.447
He's serving in the army.

29:01.448 --> 29:04.916
He sent me a letter, and I'm
worried that he has malaria.

29:04.917 --> 29:08.219
Well, like you said, he
is in the middle of a jungle.

29:08.220 --> 29:11.324
You were listening
to my phone call?

29:11.325 --> 29:13.960
Certain decibel levels do carry.

29:15.562 --> 29:17.129
But you're right.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.063
He likely does have malaria-- or dengue.

29:19.064 --> 29:21.533
I served in the Pacific.
Came down with both myself.

29:21.534 --> 29:23.034
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

29:23.035 --> 29:26.306
So, could you tell
me what this sounds like?

29:32.045 --> 29:33.513
Mm-hmm.

29:36.917 --> 29:41.487
Now, I'm no doctor, and these
symptoms seem fairly general,

29:41.488 --> 29:44.523
but if this is malaria
and it's bad enough,

29:44.524 --> 29:46.359
they could toss him out
on medical discharge.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.227
Really?

29:48.228 --> 29:49.995
Is that really true?

29:49.996 --> 29:50.997
It is.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.067
I'll tell you what.

29:55.068 --> 29:57.869
Let me get on the horn,
talk to some people I know,

29:57.870 --> 29:59.304
see if I can find some
more information for you.

29:59.305 --> 30:02.008
Now, I can't promise anything,
but it's worth a shot.

30:02.009 --> 30:02.943
Hmm?

30:07.180 --> 30:10.348
Please don't say that
if you don't actually mean it.

30:10.349 --> 30:11.616
If this is just you being charming

30:11.617 --> 30:13.651
and you have no intention of
actually helping me here--

30:13.652 --> 30:15.119
I wish there had been someone

30:15.120 --> 30:17.624
to help my mother when I was overseas.

30:17.625 --> 30:20.627
That's all I'm offering, Virginia.

30:24.364 --> 30:27.065
We need two questionnaires
in the conference room.

30:27.066 --> 30:29.569
Mrs. Scully and Mr. Pennington
need a follow-up appointment.

30:29.570 --> 30:33.872
And have we finalized the tour dates?

30:33.873 --> 30:37.610
Uh... that's a real
bugaboo, that book tour.

30:37.611 --> 30:39.312
Which days has Virginia agreed to?

30:39.313 --> 30:40.980
So far, zero.

30:40.981 --> 30:42.480
Betty, it is your job

30:42.481 --> 30:44.048
to pin Virginia down on these dates.

30:44.049 --> 30:46.517
It is your job to get her
to commit to a schedule.

30:46.518 --> 30:47.518
She's a grown woman with her own--

30:47.519 --> 30:48.987
Do you know what JP Morgan said?

30:48.988 --> 30:50.555
I don't. We're not close.

30:50.556 --> 30:53.360
"A person has two
reasons for doing something.

30:53.361 --> 30:54.994
One that sounds good..."

30:54.995 --> 30:57.396
And the real reason.

30:57.397 --> 30:59.932
You've been reading Dale Carnegie.

30:59.933 --> 31:02.067
What? That's...

31:02.068 --> 31:03.936
Don't-- Ridiculous.

31:03.937 --> 31:05.603
I know that book by heart.

31:05.604 --> 31:08.375
Dale's a local boy. Our
paths crossed back when...

31:08.376 --> 31:10.142
It's a long story.

31:10.143 --> 31:14.880
But it has come in very handy
many times in dealing with you.

31:14.881 --> 31:16.447
The point I'm trying to make is--

31:16.448 --> 31:18.485
Is that people have a
real reason for doing something.

31:18.486 --> 31:22.488
They also have a real reason
for not doing something.

31:22.489 --> 31:26.392
Yes.

31:26.393 --> 31:27.558
So when it comes to Virginia,

31:27.559 --> 31:29.160
let me give you some real reasons

31:29.161 --> 31:30.930
for her not doing something.

31:33.900 --> 31:35.600
She has an infant with a babysitter

31:35.601 --> 31:37.568
who can't keep out of the liquor cabinet,

31:37.569 --> 31:40.307
she's got a teenager
suspended for cutting class,

31:40.308 --> 31:44.476
and she's got a son fighting
in a war 8,000 miles away.

31:44.477 --> 31:47.078
Does that sound like someone
about to drop everything

31:47.079 --> 31:49.249
and go on a book tour of the Midwest?

31:49.250 --> 31:52.084
Virginia's babysitter's drinking?

31:52.085 --> 31:55.321
Know what else my friend Dale says?

31:55.322 --> 31:57.489
3/4 of the people you will meet

31:57.490 --> 32:01.360
are hungering and thirsting for sympathy.

32:01.361 --> 32:04.264
Give it to them, and they will love you.

32:37.964 --> 32:40.100
I'm here because I'm suspended.

32:40.101 --> 32:43.335
Yes, your mother told me.

32:43.336 --> 32:45.470
I only hope it's not for drinking...

32:45.471 --> 32:48.639
because if this is starting
to be a pattern with you,

32:48.640 --> 32:50.341
having witnessed it firsthand...

32:50.342 --> 32:51.511
It's not a pattern.

32:52.645 --> 32:55.047
And what do you care, anyway?

32:55.048 --> 32:59.385
I care because... your
mother is overextended.

32:59.386 --> 33:02.088
She can barely take care
of her many obligations

33:02.089 --> 33:05.457
without you adding more press--
Tessa.

33:05.458 --> 33:08.628
Tessa, I'm talking to you.

33:12.198 --> 33:16.100
I see Dale's book is
really working its magic on you.

33:16.101 --> 33:20.238
By the way, we need to cancel our
subscription of Doll Parade.

33:20.239 --> 33:23.107
It's the stimulation of
last resort for the fellas

33:23.108 --> 33:24.642
when they're, you know, donating.

33:24.643 --> 33:26.880
Go on, rip off the wrapper
and see what the problem is.

33:32.519 --> 33:36.053
Why is a girl in a bathing
suit wrapped in brown paper?

33:36.054 --> 33:37.989
'Cause it's good for circulation.

33:37.990 --> 33:39.590
But the magazine itself, it's a dog.

33:39.591 --> 33:40.994
The guys need more skin.

33:40.995 --> 33:42.395
So I'm canceling it.

33:47.934 --> 33:50.102
Hello?

33:52.339 --> 33:56.341
Um, I brought some dinner
for you and Joy...

33:56.342 --> 33:58.644
Unless the caretaker--

33:58.645 --> 34:00.280
No, I fired the caretaker.

34:02.882 --> 34:05.884
It looks like you
had good reason to.

34:05.885 --> 34:07.420
No, not really.

34:10.023 --> 34:14.023
I was just, um, watching her
get Joy dressed this morning,

34:15.061 --> 34:19.061
and it occurred to me that, um,
Joy's birthday is next week.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.001
So I thought, "What should I do?

34:22.002 --> 34:25.904
Should I plan a party
or buy her a present?"

34:25.905 --> 34:28.507
And then suddenly I...

34:28.507 --> 34:32.507
All I wanted was that nurse gone.

34:35.081 --> 34:39.452
I just wanted to be alone
with her, just the two of us.

34:42.522 --> 34:45.090
I understand.

34:45.091 --> 34:47.059
Um, that must be--

34:47.060 --> 34:48.995
It's a nightmare.
That's what it is.

34:50.496 --> 34:52.998
And you want to know the real truth? Um...

34:54.900 --> 34:58.071
I don't see why I should
buy Joy anything...

35:01.474 --> 35:03.443
'cause she's already gone.

35:05.945 --> 35:08.113
It's like she's dead.

35:08.114 --> 35:12.114
It's like sitting here day and night...

35:13.453 --> 35:16.154
with a corpse.

35:16.155 --> 35:18.123
A corpse?

35:18.124 --> 35:21.093
What a terrible thing to say.

35:21.094 --> 35:22.495
Joy is sitting right here.

35:22.496 --> 35:25.063
You have no idea what she knows

35:25.064 --> 35:28.100
or what she feels or cares or-- or hears.

35:28.101 --> 35:32.237
For you to just write her
off like that is criminal.

35:32.238 --> 35:34.605
Joy is the woman that you
married all these years ago,

35:34.606 --> 35:38.342
and you have to remember and
honor who she is-- still.

35:38.343 --> 35:44.509
Treat her with the same dignity
and respect that you always did.

35:47.587 --> 35:49.455
We're gonna give her a bath...

35:49.456 --> 35:51.323
Together...

35:51.324 --> 35:52.491
Now.

35:55.962 --> 35:58.565
Whew.

36:01.100 --> 36:04.236
Your elevator's out.

36:04.237 --> 36:07.139
I was worried you weren't eating enough.

36:07.140 --> 36:09.240
Now I understand those
four flights of stairs

36:09.241 --> 36:10.508
are what's keeping you so thin.

36:12.379 --> 36:13.645
Beef bourguignon.

36:13.646 --> 36:15.314
May I come in?

36:15.315 --> 36:17.549
Of course.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.319
Sorry. I'm not much of a housekeeper.

36:19.320 --> 36:22.588
As if that's news to me.

36:22.589 --> 36:26.024
It's very... pleasant.

36:26.025 --> 36:27.627
"Pleasant."

36:27.628 --> 36:29.361
That word.

36:29.362 --> 36:31.963
Whenever we'd go to a restaurant
and you didn't like your meal,

36:31.964 --> 36:33.564
you'd always smile and
say, "It's very pleasant."

36:34.967 --> 36:37.468
Well, this time I mean it's pleasant.

36:37.469 --> 36:39.403
Knowing you, I was worried you'd
take the first place you saw.

36:39.404 --> 36:41.040
This was the first place.

36:43.276 --> 36:45.009
Why don't I put that in the fridge?

36:45.010 --> 36:46.379
Why don't I
put it in the fridge,

36:46.380 --> 36:48.581
and you make us a drink?

36:54.087 --> 36:56.956
Your gentleman
friend seems very nice.

36:56.957 --> 37:00.359
Quite a firm handshake.

37:00.360 --> 37:03.295
Sorry about how that happened.

37:03.296 --> 37:05.898
I'll be honest--
I'm not sure what to think,

37:05.899 --> 37:07.532
given you and this man

37:07.533 --> 37:10.201
have cause to see Bill
and Virginia already.

37:10.202 --> 37:13.237
Has it occurred to you that you
might not be ideally suited?

37:13.238 --> 37:16.007
And how long
should Graham and I

37:16.008 --> 37:18.011
wait to address our
sexual issues, Barton?

37:18.012 --> 37:19.011
30 years?

37:19.012 --> 37:21.179
No, of course not.

37:21.180 --> 37:23.583
I just want you to be happy, Margaret.

37:25.051 --> 37:28.053
Well, I actually think I've found a way.

37:28.054 --> 37:32.054
And it starts with telling
the truth about everything.

37:33.026 --> 37:35.260
Who's J?

37:35.261 --> 37:36.361
J?

37:36.362 --> 37:38.162
All those dishes
in the refrigerator

37:38.163 --> 37:39.365
with instructions taped to them--

37:39.366 --> 37:43.335
"Reheat in a 350-degree oven
for 15 minutes. Love, J"?

37:43.336 --> 37:45.871
Who's J?

37:45.872 --> 37:48.607
Mm. Is it a man?

37:48.608 --> 37:50.609
"J" is Judith.

37:50.610 --> 37:53.444
She lives in the building. She
leaves me dinner sometimes.

37:53.445 --> 37:54.912
And notes with hearts.

37:54.913 --> 37:56.447
It doesn't mean
anything, Margaret.

37:56.448 --> 37:59.183
Not to you, perhaps,
but what do you mean to her?

37:59.184 --> 38:01.118
We're friends. We
enjoy each other's company.

38:01.119 --> 38:02.488
I took her to dinner on New Year's.

38:02.489 --> 38:03.889
We play Cribbage.

38:03.890 --> 38:06.458
Does she know?

38:06.459 --> 38:07.492
About you?

38:07.493 --> 38:10.429
You mean what kind of man I am?

38:10.430 --> 38:13.099
That I'm the kind who can't
cook, who can't keep house,

38:13.100 --> 38:15.934
who, after a failed marriage of 30 years

38:15.935 --> 38:19.505
is grateful for the friendship
of a-- a nice middle-aged woman

38:19.506 --> 38:23.075
who occasionally stops by with meatloaf

38:23.076 --> 38:25.209
and stays to watch "Perry Mason"?

38:25.210 --> 38:27.311
And after "Perry Mason"?

38:27.312 --> 38:29.480
Not that it's any
of your business, Margaret,

38:29.481 --> 38:31.916
but we're not having a
sexual relationship.

38:31.917 --> 38:33.918
Well, neither were you and I.

38:33.919 --> 38:36.620
Now, I understand why you can't
be honest with your daughter,

38:36.621 --> 38:38.324
and I pay the price every
time I call Vivian

38:38.325 --> 38:39.891
and she hangs up on me,

38:39.892 --> 38:42.993
but this woman, this new woman,
she deserves to know the truth.

38:42.994 --> 38:45.062
She deserves to know what kind
of future she can expect.

38:45.063 --> 38:46.499
You're out of line, Margaret.

38:46.500 --> 38:47.599
Why?

38:47.600 --> 38:50.201
Why are you the only one
who gets a choice in this?

38:50.202 --> 38:52.336
What are you talking about?
You moved on.

38:52.337 --> 38:53.537
With-- with what's-his-name.

38:53.538 --> 38:55.072
Well, then let
me tell him the truth.

38:55.073 --> 38:56.874
Let me tell him why our marriage ended.

38:56.875 --> 39:00.876
How I choose to conduct
my private life is my business,

39:00.913 --> 39:02.914
and mine only.

39:02.915 --> 39:06.918
Barton, what have you and I

39:06.919 --> 39:09.354
learned through all of our pain

39:09.355 --> 39:12.524
if you're lying to a woman
who cares about you

39:12.525 --> 39:14.126
and I can't tell Graham

39:14.127 --> 39:17.596
why sex is the only way I
know that he loves me?

39:17.597 --> 39:20.499
Tell Judith.

39:20.500 --> 39:23.235
Let me tell Graham.

39:23.236 --> 39:27.272
You're asking too much, Margaret.

39:27.273 --> 39:29.375
I'm sorry.

39:35.014 --> 39:38.150
Oh, for the love of God...

39:38.151 --> 39:40.019
Nice to see you again, Leslie.

39:40.020 --> 39:41.153
Really?

39:41.154 --> 39:43.354
'Cause I'm not sure it's so nice at all.

39:43.355 --> 39:45.324
I do think we can agree

39:45.325 --> 39:49.227
that a little controversy
can be a good thing.

39:49.228 --> 39:50.529
Can't it?

39:50.530 --> 39:51.997
Drive sales.

39:51.998 --> 39:54.999
Certainly didn't hurt "Women
In Love" or "Lolita," did it?

39:55.000 --> 39:57.870
If you're comparing
those books to your book,

39:57.871 --> 39:59.404
your book isn't dirty.

39:59.405 --> 40:02.406
Believe me, I read your book
before I agreed to stock it.

40:02.407 --> 40:04.143
You're absolutely correct.

40:04.144 --> 40:07.112
But what if people thought it were?

40:07.113 --> 40:11.113
What I'm proposing is that
you take every last copy

40:12.585 --> 40:13.985
you have left,

40:13.986 --> 40:17.022
wrap it up in plain brown paper,

40:17.023 --> 40:19.358
and create a display for the front window.

40:19.359 --> 40:21.059
And?

40:21.060 --> 40:22.294
And watch.

40:22.295 --> 40:24.195
With no sign, no explanation,

40:24.196 --> 40:26.297
curiosity will get the better of people.

40:26.298 --> 40:28.234
You tell someone he can't have something,

40:28.235 --> 40:30.168
suddenly it's all he wants.

40:30.169 --> 40:33.239
Next thing, people are in the
store asking a question,

40:33.240 --> 40:34.472
making a purchase.

40:34.473 --> 40:36.242
With all due respect,

40:36.243 --> 40:40.045
you're a scientist, not a salesman.

40:40.046 --> 40:42.514
Just test me and-- and see.

40:42.515 --> 40:44.049
Try it.

40:44.050 --> 40:48.050
And if it doesn't lead
to increased sales, I'll, um...

40:49.322 --> 40:51.257
I'll buy every last copy.

40:56.028 --> 40:59.029
"Wouldn't you like a magic
phrase to stop arguments,

40:59.030 --> 41:01.165
end ill feelings, create goodwill,

41:01.166 --> 41:03.369
and make the other person feel better?

41:03.370 --> 41:05.604
Yes? All right, here it is.

41:05.605 --> 41:09.605
Say, 'I don't blame you one
iota for feeling as you do.

41:10.476 --> 41:13.645
I understand how you feel.'"

41:23.956 --> 41:25.424
I've been meaning to come over, Paul.

41:27.426 --> 41:30.896
I wanted you to know that,
uh, I looked into it,

41:30.897 --> 41:33.465
and in neurology, Dolan is the best.

41:33.466 --> 41:35.167
There's no one better.

41:41.274 --> 41:43.975
I-I understand how you feel.

41:47.380 --> 41:50.249
You can't
begin to know how I feel.

41:52.351 --> 41:55.120
My life is over.

41:55.121 --> 41:57.289
It's just fucking over.

41:57.290 --> 42:00.025
There's nothing left.

42:00.026 --> 42:02.160
I have nothing left.

42:32.358 --> 42:33.993
You're home early.

42:33.994 --> 42:36.428
Uh, yes.

42:36.429 --> 42:37.496
I, uh...

42:40.399 --> 42:43.202
I'll, uh-- I'll
have dinner shortly.

42:45.104 --> 42:48.606
I was thinking today, um,

42:48.607 --> 42:50.943
about when you were first
named head of the department

42:50.944 --> 42:52.143
at Maternity.

42:52.144 --> 42:55.381
You-- you thought the
position had gone to Carlisle,

42:55.382 --> 42:58.016
and then they handed you the job.

42:58.017 --> 43:01.320
Yes. That was, um...

43:03.089 --> 43:04.522
a long time ago.

43:04.523 --> 43:08.523
And you wanted to celebrate.

43:09.061 --> 43:12.964
We wanted, the two of us,
to celebrate together...

43:12.965 --> 43:17.068
because you said that I had been--

43:17.069 --> 43:20.572
I remember you used the
word "instrumental"

43:20.573 --> 43:23.174
in helping you win the job.

43:23.175 --> 43:24.610
You were instrumental.

43:28.114 --> 43:31.449
Do you remember what you did?

43:31.450 --> 43:35.450
I... took us out to dinner.

43:36.088 --> 43:38.223
I think I-I bought

43:38.224 --> 43:44.321
the most expensive bottle
of champagne on the list.

44:06.986 --> 44:08.586
It's the army.

44:08.587 --> 44:10.554
They like to keep you waiting,
remind you who's in charge.

44:10.555 --> 44:11.924
Well, I had no idea

44:11.925 --> 44:15.460
that we would be waiting for two hours.

44:15.461 --> 44:17.361
I'm sorry. I know I dragged you here.

44:17.362 --> 44:19.196
You didn't. I volunteered.

44:19.197 --> 44:21.098
And my assistants can hold down the fort.

44:22.169 --> 44:24.437
You mean Snap, Crackle, and Pop?

44:27.339 --> 44:29.208
God, you are so like her...

44:29.209 --> 44:31.076
A girl I used to know.

44:32.945 --> 44:34.579
Here it comes again.

44:34.580 --> 44:37.983
The old Dan Logan charm.

44:40.086 --> 44:43.321
Again, my apologies.

44:43.322 --> 44:44.457
That wasn't a line, by the way.

44:44.458 --> 44:46.291
It's true.

44:46.292 --> 44:49.327
She had dark hair like you.

44:49.328 --> 44:53.298
And a brother who hadn't
made it home from France.

44:53.299 --> 44:55.367
I met her at a USO dance.

44:57.536 --> 44:59.336
You were probably still in grade school.

44:59.337 --> 45:00.938
I used to go to USO dances.

45:00.939 --> 45:02.975
Oh, so you are old
enough to remember?

45:02.976 --> 45:04.242
Barely.

45:04.243 --> 45:06.278
I was 18, when it ended.

45:08.514 --> 45:12.514
She was the only girl in the
room I wanted to dance with.

45:13.285 --> 45:15.521
But I hadn't been to
Arthur Murray at that point,

45:15.522 --> 45:18.256
and the dance floor was crowded.

45:18.257 --> 45:21.159
Nearly broke the poor thing's ankle.

45:24.196 --> 45:26.564
But she just laughed.

45:26.565 --> 45:28.900
She put her arms around my neck

45:28.901 --> 45:30.467
and made me carry her off the dance floor.

45:30.468 --> 45:33.370
She told me later she liked
being the center of attention.

45:33.371 --> 45:35.441
Didn't care what anyone else thought.

45:38.144 --> 45:41.446
There's something very...

45:41.447 --> 45:44.316
intoxicating about a woman like that.

45:46.886 --> 45:49.254
What happened to her?

45:49.255 --> 45:52.924
I still had six months
before I shipped out.

45:52.925 --> 45:55.927
We didn't let the time go to waste.

45:55.928 --> 45:57.327
And after the war?

45:57.328 --> 45:59.596
After the war, it
was back to real life.

45:59.597 --> 46:02.234
And back to
the girlfriend at home.

46:02.235 --> 46:04.036
Back to my wife.

46:10.276 --> 46:13.211
But that girl...

46:13.212 --> 46:15.914
- Did you love her?
- Very much.

46:15.915 --> 46:17.247
Then how does a man

46:17.248 --> 46:19.185
just walk away back to his fiancã©e?

46:19.186 --> 46:20.519
Wife.

46:24.056 --> 46:27.659
Maybe you were afraid.

46:27.660 --> 46:31.660
Afraid that if you ran off with that...
dazzling girl...

46:34.099 --> 46:36.233
that you would never really measure up.

46:36.234 --> 46:39.004
If that's how you
want your story to end.

46:39.005 --> 46:41.973
But I never gave her the chance

46:41.974 --> 46:46.344
to see that the Dan Logan
charm wears thin...

46:46.345 --> 46:48.012
or so I'm told.

46:48.013 --> 46:49.515
And your wife?

46:49.516 --> 46:51.482
Is still my wife.

46:51.483 --> 46:53.586
And still none the wiser.

46:53.587 --> 46:55.553
No.

46:55.554 --> 46:57.556
Much wiser.

46:59.491 --> 47:00.993
He's ready for you.

47:07.132 --> 47:09.134
I had the worst day imaginable.

47:09.135 --> 47:11.970
I didn't know who else to call.

47:11.971 --> 47:14.039
I'm glad you called.

47:16.342 --> 47:18.010
Matt...

47:21.914 --> 47:25.550
Okay.

47:25.551 --> 47:27.619
So, what happened today?

47:27.620 --> 47:29.254
It was awful.

47:29.255 --> 47:31.223
Did you get suspended again?

47:31.224 --> 47:34.259
I found out something...

47:34.260 --> 47:37.161
really bad about my mother.

47:37.162 --> 47:40.898
Did you find one of
those dildos in her bedroom?

47:40.899 --> 47:44.068
Did you walk in on her with some guy?

47:44.069 --> 47:47.373
Please tell me that you read
some weird fantasy in her diary.

47:47.374 --> 47:50.008
You know what, Matt?

47:50.009 --> 47:53.212
I'm really not in the mood
to talk about it after all.

47:56.148 --> 47:58.249
Geez.

47:58.250 --> 48:00.885
Tessa.

48:00.886 --> 48:04.289
You want to talk,
you don't want to talk.

48:04.290 --> 48:07.925
I mean, I'm trying here.

48:07.926 --> 48:09.460
But make up your mind.

48:09.461 --> 48:12.631
My mind's already made up.

48:14.033 --> 48:15.934
So, why don't you undo your belt,

48:15.935 --> 48:18.137
and I'll put my mouth on you?

48:21.240 --> 48:23.107
Yeah?

48:23.108 --> 48:24.876
Why not?

48:32.618 --> 48:36.454
You obviously misunderstood me.

48:36.455 --> 48:38.588
We had an agreement. And that was--

48:38.589 --> 48:40.259
I understood the agreement.

48:40.260 --> 48:42.026
And I did it.

48:42.027 --> 48:45.263
And then it worked, just as you said.

48:45.264 --> 48:46.665
You've sold out?

48:46.666 --> 48:50.302
Every last copy.

48:54.139 --> 48:55.873
Oh, I'm sorry.

48:55.874 --> 48:57.874
I just can't-- I can't go home yet.

48:57.875 --> 48:59.576
I don't want my daughter
to see me like this.

48:59.577 --> 49:02.112
Well, at least he
doesn't have malaria.

49:02.113 --> 49:04.216
Oh, and alcohol
poisoning is better?

49:04.217 --> 49:07.919
Sweating, nausea.

49:07.920 --> 49:10.153
Why don't they just call
it "drank himself stupid"?

49:10.154 --> 49:11.588
Well, kids are stupid at that age,

49:11.589 --> 49:13.258
and he's on his own for the first time--

49:13.259 --> 49:14.592
Exactly.

49:14.593 --> 49:16.960
A boy who can't even hold his liquor

49:16.961 --> 49:19.331
has now volunteered for a combat unit?

49:19.332 --> 49:21.933
And they let him?

49:21.934 --> 49:24.435
Why didn't they call me? Tell me?

49:24.436 --> 49:25.636
He's 18.

49:25.637 --> 49:26.937
Henry promised me

49:26.938 --> 49:28.939
that he would not take a combat position.

49:28.940 --> 49:32.275
We had a deal that he would
scrub latrines, do laundry.

49:32.276 --> 49:34.044
Just 'cause he's in a combat unit

49:34.045 --> 49:35.278
doesn't mean he's not gonna be okay.

49:35.279 --> 49:36.382
You don't know him.

49:36.383 --> 49:39.952
Henry cried when Bambi's mother died.

49:41.987 --> 49:45.157
He used to hide under the
covers during thunderstorms.

49:45.158 --> 49:47.658
But he's a soldier now.

49:47.659 --> 49:49.661
And you know what a soldier does?

49:51.330 --> 49:53.965
He gets through the day.

49:53.966 --> 49:55.366
That's it.

49:55.367 --> 49:59.202
He wakes up, makes his bed, eats
his breakfast, does his work.

49:59.203 --> 50:01.171
He doesn't wonder what's
gonna happen tomorrow.

50:01.172 --> 50:03.876
He doesn't look around the bend
to see what's coming next week.

50:06.445 --> 50:09.080
He lives one moment to the next,

50:09.081 --> 50:10.447
and at the end of the day, goes to bed.

50:10.448 --> 50:12.184
And when he wakes up in the morning,

50:12.185 --> 50:15.253
he does it all over again...

50:15.254 --> 50:19.254
because anything else
is either speculation

50:20.125 --> 50:23.162
or suffering a future pain
that will likely never happen.

50:31.537 --> 50:33.471
One second after another--

50:33.472 --> 50:35.305
that's how I got through the war.

50:35.306 --> 50:38.143
That's how your son's
getting through the war.

50:40.279 --> 50:44.882
And that's how you'll
get through this war...

50:44.883 --> 50:47.152
'cause it's the only way.

51:17.216 --> 51:19.649
...alone in this house
if you aren't married.

51:19.650 --> 51:22.953
Well, it's a family home,
and I'm the last of the family.

51:22.954 --> 51:25.021
The dishes are in the rack.

51:25.022 --> 51:27.459
That lovely beef stew saved for leftovers.

51:28.927 --> 51:31.194
Who did you say made that for you?

51:31.195 --> 51:33.198
One of the girls at the office.

51:36.468 --> 51:38.170
They, uh...

51:40.939 --> 51:43.141
Why don't I walk you up to your apartment?

51:43.142 --> 51:45.543
Or...

51:45.544 --> 51:48.412
I left some extra food out for the cat.

51:48.413 --> 51:52.413
I don't think she'd miss me too
much if I stayed the night.

51:57.189 --> 51:59.322
Oh, I'm sorry. I've shocked you.

51:59.323 --> 52:00.323
No, no.

52:00.324 --> 52:01.627
Not at all.

52:04.162 --> 52:06.397
I don't know how to say this,

52:06.398 --> 52:08.534
but I think I owe it to you to be honest.

52:08.535 --> 52:11.869
You're still in
love with your ex-wife.

52:11.870 --> 52:15.870
No, that's not, uh...

52:16.208 --> 52:19.143
No.

52:19.144 --> 52:22.046
There were...

52:22.047 --> 52:24.149
some difficulties in our marriage,

52:24.150 --> 52:26.985
problems that still exist with me.

52:31.957 --> 52:33.358
I'm, uh...

52:38.597 --> 52:40.498
Uh...

52:40.499 --> 52:42.567
I'm on medication...

52:42.568 --> 52:45.202
for high blood pressure.

52:45.203 --> 52:47.505
Comes with certain side effects.

52:47.506 --> 52:51.506
Oh, I see.

52:52.077 --> 52:53.211
I haven't wanted to tell you

52:53.212 --> 52:57.315
because I've been enjoying
your company so much.

52:57.316 --> 52:58.983
And, uh, nowadays,

52:58.984 --> 53:01.386
women seem to think that
sex is so important.

53:01.387 --> 53:02.988
Yep.

53:04.957 --> 53:07.525
Not all women.

53:10.262 --> 53:12.331
Oh!

53:14.399 --> 53:16.367
Do I have the wrong night?

53:16.368 --> 53:17.969
It's...

53:17.970 --> 53:20.237
Thursday.

53:20.238 --> 53:21.972
I'm sorry, Jo.

53:21.973 --> 53:23.575
I thought it was Friday.

53:23.576 --> 53:25.876
Is that nightie new?

53:25.877 --> 53:27.279
It looks pretty on you.

53:27.280 --> 53:29.013
Doesn't it, Graham?

53:29.014 --> 53:30.082
Come here.

53:38.323 --> 53:39.558
Sleep well, Magpie.

53:39.559 --> 53:41.425
You too.

53:41.426 --> 53:43.328
Both of you.

53:45.297 --> 53:47.298
Lights on or off?

53:47.299 --> 53:49.067
Off, please.

54:26.872 --> 54:28.340
Hello?

54:31.476 --> 54:33.944
Hello?

54:33.945 --> 54:35.279
Bill.

54:35.280 --> 54:38.215
Uh...

54:38.216 --> 54:41.153
I'm sorry, but tonight's
not really a good night.

54:41.154 --> 54:42.253
Tessa's here.

54:42.254 --> 54:43.355
Oh, I-I know.

54:43.356 --> 54:47.259
I-I just wanted to--
wanted to talk to you.

54:49.027 --> 54:51.561
- About?
- Some good news.

54:51.562 --> 54:54.232
Uh, Little, Brown have agreed
to a second run of our book.

54:54.233 --> 54:56.200
That's fantastic.

54:56.201 --> 55:00.201
Does that mean that we are
moving ahead with the tour?

55:00.939 --> 55:03.608
Uh, actually, the more
I thought about the tour,

55:03.609 --> 55:07.611
the more I realized it may
not be, uh, the best time

55:07.612 --> 55:10.482
for you to be on the road.

55:11.950 --> 55:15.119
Uh, well, it's not ideal.

55:15.120 --> 55:19.356
So instead, we're gonna
try a new marketing strategy--

55:19.357 --> 55:23.327
wrapping the books in brown paper.

55:23.328 --> 55:25.895
It's a way of eliciting
curiosity from the public...

55:25.896 --> 55:28.633
Selling the book as
something mysterious...

55:28.634 --> 55:29.600
Illicit, even.

55:29.601 --> 55:31.001
Really?

55:31.002 --> 55:35.002
Why I'm really
here, though, is, um...

55:36.308 --> 55:37.642
Uh, to talk to you about Henry.

55:37.643 --> 55:39.910
Have you heard anything more?

55:39.911 --> 55:41.644
Maybe we could call someone.

55:41.645 --> 55:43.315
You know-- to get a definitive answer.

55:43.316 --> 55:47.084
Actually, I've
already taken care of it.

55:47.085 --> 55:49.386
It's not what I thought it was.

55:49.387 --> 55:51.956
So he's-- he's not sick.

55:51.957 --> 55:54.192
Well, that-- that's-- that's good news.

55:56.394 --> 55:59.363
Uh, also, I've, um...

55:59.364 --> 56:02.533
I realized that, um...

56:02.534 --> 56:06.871
that this gift-- the coat, I mean--

56:06.872 --> 56:10.241
was a surprise to you...

56:10.242 --> 56:14.242
and an odd gesture-- for me, anyway...

56:15.046 --> 56:18.649
Fur being the kind of thing a-a man...

56:18.650 --> 56:22.650
uh, buys for his wife.

56:23.889 --> 56:25.156
Um...

56:25.157 --> 56:27.191
You know, to be honest, I...

56:27.192 --> 56:31.192
I-I was reading this, uh, silly book.

56:31.997 --> 56:35.032
A huge best-seller, of course.

56:35.033 --> 56:37.433
An advice book that goes
about as deep as a thimble.

56:37.434 --> 56:41.006
Um, you can't believe the things
on the bookshelves these--

56:41.007 --> 56:44.909
Um, all that aside...

56:44.910 --> 56:47.011
I meant what I said.

56:47.012 --> 56:51.012
None of our success would
have happened without you.

56:52.150 --> 56:56.150
So why-- why shouldn't you wear something

56:57.055 --> 56:58.989
that makes you feel good?

56:58.990 --> 57:03.328
It's gorgeous, Bill...

57:05.297 --> 57:07.064
and so generous.

57:07.065 --> 57:08.399
But I...

57:08.400 --> 57:13.695
Look, tonight we have
several things to celebrate--

57:13.730 --> 57:17.641
the second run of our book,
Henry now malaria-free.

57:17.642 --> 57:21.079
So I-I was wondering, have you eaten?

57:24.416 --> 57:25.916
No.

57:25.917 --> 57:29.087
Can I take you to dinner?

57:32.457 --> 57:33.891
All right.

57:33.892 --> 57:36.428
Good.

57:37.596 --> 57:41.596
There's, uh, kind of a chill in the air.

57:42.300 --> 57:44.001
If only you had a coat.
