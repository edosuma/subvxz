01:13.782 --> 01:15.919
Maybe it's the moonlight
but I've got to admit

01:15.920 --> 01:17.783
you're looking pretty good for a corpse.

01:17.818 --> 01:18.785
Philip, I can explain everything.

01:19.783 --> 01:23.055
Let me save you the trouble. It was
you that planned Pallisters murder,

01:23.056 --> 01:25.135
but your twin sister
Maxine squibbed him off.

01:25.136 --> 01:28.321
You decided to take the rap, knowing
you had the perfect alibi in me.

01:28.322 --> 01:31.779
That's why you came on so strong that
night: Play me for the dumb sap I am.

01:31.814 --> 01:33.780
Philip, it wasn't like that, not with you.

01:34.783 --> 01:35.483
Oh yeah?

01:35.779 --> 01:37.857
So what you going to do, turn me in?

01:37.858 --> 01:41.781
Watch me do the sit down dance in
the electric chair at Sing Sing?

01:41.816 --> 01:44.782
No, sweetlips, I'm gonna let you kiss me.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.779
Sir I think you should come
and take a look at this.

02:03.779 --> 02:04.781
Sir it really is quiet urgent.

02:06.776 --> 02:09.661
I want you Loretta, I
want you body next to mine.

02:09.662 --> 02:12.777
I want you like you were
that Tuesday night. Kiss me.

02:13.776 --> 02:18.779
Honestly, you haven't been
off this machine in a month!

02:24.063 --> 02:25.174
Choose you character.

02:25.175 --> 02:27.917
OHHHGGHHH, honestly, I
just want to talk to him.

02:27.918 --> 02:29.652
Ohhh anything, Sammy the Squib,

02:29.653 --> 02:33.065
crack shot with Tommy gun, engage.

02:33.766 --> 02:34.466
So frivolous!

02:39.063 --> 02:40.065
Mr Lister sir?

02:42.066 --> 02:42.866
Hmmm, curious.

02:54.064 --> 02:57.025
Hi Kryten. What are you doing here?

02:57.060 --> 02:59.584
Sir, I've just got the
results of the chemical scan,

02:59.585 --> 03:03.060
I've discovered minute amounts of
millenium oxide in the local vicinity.

03:04.064 --> 03:06.026
Couldn't be more pleased
for you. See you in an hour.

03:06.061 --> 03:09.869
Sir, I believe we've wandered accidentally
into a rogue simulant hunting zone.

03:09.870 --> 03:14.063
That would explain the devastation on the
derelicts where we picked up this very game.

03:15.058 --> 03:16.057
Philip, who is it?

03:17.058 --> 03:18.060
Ohhh, it's Sammy the Squib.

03:18.095 --> 03:19.027
Orrrhh, good evening Miss.

03:19.062 --> 03:23.677
Don't kill me Sammy, I'll do anything,
kill him. I'll come away with you Sammy,

03:23.678 --> 03:28.061
it'll be just like the old days. I
never stopped loving you Sammy. Kiss me.

03:29.059 --> 03:30.062
You're trash, aren't you?

03:31.058 --> 03:32.058
I'm programmed to be trash.

03:32.114 --> 03:34.147
Sir, you have to turn
off the AR console.

03:34.148 --> 03:38.115
We have to close down and continue on
silent running in order to avoid detection.

03:38.516 --> 03:39.216
Ten minutes.

03:39.251 --> 03:40.100
Sir.

03:40.101 --> 03:42.000
Five minutes. I'll keep my hat on.

03:42.035 --> 03:42.799
Now.

03:44.103 --> 03:45.103
Philip?

03:46.601 --> 03:50.106
I'll be back sweetlips. Stay bad.

03:52.099 --> 03:55.225
Kryten, you are a total gooseberry.
Next time I play on the AR machine

03:55.226 --> 03:57.998
I'm going to give you some money
and send you to the pictures.

04:02.096 --> 04:06.005
At last, we have silent running.
OK, long range scanners are down,

04:06.006 --> 04:09.098
the only early warning
we've got is you. Stay alert.

04:09.133 --> 04:11.100
OK bud, I'll keep my nose peeled.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.096
You took your time. Where've you been?

04:21.130 --> 04:22.096
I was in the AR machine.

04:22.130 --> 04:23.064
Again?

04:23.899 --> 04:25.065
What'd you mean again?

04:25.100 --> 04:27.095
Everyone knows you only use
the AR machine to have sex.

04:30.599 --> 04:31.697
That is not true.

04:32.738 --> 04:36.706
Yes, true. It's pathetic watching
you grind away day after day.

04:36.707 --> 04:39.744
It's like a dog that's
missing it's masters leg.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.738
What's all the hullabaloo?

04:43.741 --> 04:44.738
We've wandered into rouge simulant country.

04:45.736 --> 04:48.662
Bio-mechanical killers created
for a war that never took place.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.903
Some of them escaped the
dismantelling programme

04:50.904 --> 04:52.549
and now they prowl around deep space

04:52.550 --> 04:54.743
searching for a quarry
worthy of their mettle.

04:54.778 --> 04:57.738
I say we should abandon the pursuit
of Red Dwarf and flee from the zone.

04:57.773 --> 04:59.736
Give up the chase? Are you kidding?

05:00.740 --> 05:01.737
Wait, my nose is getting something.

05:02.736 --> 05:03.736
Powering up.

05:04.737 --> 05:06.735
Scanners report a battle
class cruiser on intercept.

05:06.770 --> 05:07.741
It's rougue simulants all right.

05:10.524 --> 05:12.530
Recommend immediate total
and unequivical surrender.

05:13.955 --> 05:15.380
Sir, surrender is the
worst thing we could do.

05:15.381 --> 05:18.064
They despise humans and
all forms of humanoid life.

05:18.065 --> 05:20.953
They believe you to be the
vermin of the universe sir.

05:21.955 --> 05:22.950
I didn't know they'd met him.

05:25.948 --> 05:27.955
Getting a message. Punching it up.

05:29.949 --> 05:30.948
State your species and purpose.

05:32.953 --> 05:34.840
One of us will have to speak to them.

05:34.841 --> 05:37.951
Who's the least human looking?
Listy, the mike's all yours.

05:40.948 --> 05:43.454
Wait a minute. I've got an
idea. Stall them with static.

05:43.455 --> 05:44.949
Kryten mid-section. Cat, you too.

05:48.947 --> 05:52.950
Why do you delay? State your species
and purpose. You have one minute.

05:54.150 --> 05:55.111
Lister, what the hell are you doing?

05:55.146 --> 05:57.953
Wait a minute, nearly ready...
OK, stand by to transmit.

05:59.947 --> 06:00.912
Incoming.

06:00.947 --> 06:05.951
I am Tarka Dall, an ambassador
of the great Vindaloovian Empire.

06:07.150 --> 06:10.245
Scanners report a human life
on your vessel. Is this so?

06:10.949 --> 06:14.007
Humans! The Vindaloovian
People despise all humans.

06:14.008 --> 06:17.947
They are the vermin of the Universe.
Is that not right Bindi Baji?

06:19.947 --> 06:22.946
You bet, we hate them.
Scum, scum, scum, scum, scum!

06:24.951 --> 06:28.947
The Vinadloovian Empire is
pledged to exterminate them all.

06:32.213 --> 06:34.220
We will not rest until
out task is completed.

06:35.215 --> 06:35.915
Errrrrr, Lister.

06:41.215 --> 06:42.180
Hi.

06:42.215 --> 06:43.219
How's it going Bud?

06:52.214 --> 06:56.445
A human, a humanoid,
a hologrammatical human

06:56.446 --> 07:00.393
and a mechanoid who
is a slave to humans.

07:00.394 --> 07:03.214
I had hoped for so much more.

07:03.676 --> 07:07.549
I've no idea who you are, but
boarding this vessel is an act of war.

07:07.550 --> 07:08.671
Ergo, we surrender.

07:10.972 --> 07:15.674
Primitive! You will be no sport
at all. I have no alternative.

07:25.873 --> 07:26.673
How long have we been out?

07:27.669 --> 07:28.673
According to the navicomp, three weeks.

07:29.672 --> 07:33.071
Strange.. the drive interface has
been upgraded, and so have the engines.

07:33.672 --> 07:36.669
And if this readout is correct,
we've been armed. Laser cannons.

07:36.704 --> 07:38.668
They've totally upgraded the whole ship.

07:39.674 --> 07:41.669
They've even got rid of the
squeak on the seat tilt control.

07:43.673 --> 07:45.442
We have made some
improvements to your craft.

07:45.443 --> 07:47.673
Now at least you may prove
to be of some small amusement.

07:49.667 --> 07:51.668
You have two Earth minutes before we attack.

07:52.672 --> 07:53.635
Let's get out of here.

07:53.670 --> 07:56.612
Wait, I know this game.
It's called cat and mouse,

07:56.613 --> 07:59.670
and there's only one way
to win; don't be the mouse.

08:00.667 --> 08:01.367
What are you saying?

08:01.671 --> 08:06.522
I'm saying, the mouse never wins. Not
unless you believe those lying cartoons.

08:06.523 --> 08:10.636
We don't run, we strike. It's the
last thing they'll be expecting.

08:10.671 --> 08:16.298
No, the last thing they'll be expecting is
for us to turn into ice skating mongooses

08:16.299 --> 08:20.668
and to dance the Bolero. And your
plan makes about as much sense.

08:20.703 --> 08:21.667
I say go with it.

08:22.669 --> 08:23.630
Agreed.

08:23.665 --> 08:27.273
You're going to go with one
of my plans? Are you nuts?

08:27.274 --> 08:31.669
What happens if we all get killed?
I'll never hear the last of it!

08:37.671 --> 08:40.669
What are they doing? Power up the weapons!

08:40.703 --> 08:41.686
Nailed them.

08:41.721 --> 08:42.634
Fluke hit.

08:42.669 --> 08:43.669
Take them with us.

08:43.703 --> 08:44.635
Can't return fire.

08:44.670 --> 08:47.665
Hack into their navigation computer.
Transmit the Armageddon Virus.

08:49.669 --> 08:50.630
What is it?

08:50.665 --> 08:51.670
The navicomp, something's wrong.

08:53.666 --> 08:56.168
See you in Silicon Hell.

09:00.170 --> 09:03.133
Shutdown all network links. The
navicomp has been infected with a virus.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.531
The navicomp has frozen us out,
we're locked on this course.

09:05.532 --> 09:08.166
If we carry on ahead at this speed,
how long before we hit trouble?

09:09.170 --> 09:12.132
Well if you define trouble as a rather large
moon directly in our path, about 38 minutes.

09:12.167 --> 09:15.345
Sir, the only solution is for
me to contract the virus myself,

09:15.346 --> 09:18.625
analyze it's structure and attempt
to create a software antidote

09:18.626 --> 09:20.442
before it wipes out my core program.

09:20.443 --> 09:23.165
Do I have your permission
to sacrifice myself, sirs?

09:23.200 --> 09:24.165
Do Lemmings like cliffs? Granted!

09:26.165 --> 09:28.163
I am going to have to create a dove program.

09:29.164 --> 09:30.133
Dove program?

09:30.168 --> 09:32.345
A dove program spreads
peace through the system,

09:32.346 --> 09:34.167
obliterating the viral cells as it goes.

09:37.167 --> 09:42.642
The virus is extremely complex. I will have
to dedicate all my run time to its solution.

09:42.643 --> 09:45.164
Shutting down all non essential systems.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.164
Is there anything we can do? Can we help?

09:49.167 --> 09:50.161
Watch my dreams.

09:58.350 --> 09:59.352
Twenty three minutes to impact. Any changes?

10:00.349 --> 10:01.353
Getting worse. Weaker and weaker.

10:03.374 --> 10:04.374
We're getting something.

10:15.371 --> 10:16.372
What is this?

10:18.371 --> 10:21.376
I think we've tapped directly into
whatever passes for Kryten's sub-concious.

10:23.371 --> 10:25.371
Why's he a Sheriff in some old western?

10:28.373 --> 10:32.398
Must be how his core program is coping
with the battle against the virus.

10:32.399 --> 10:36.369
For whatever reason it's converted
the struggle into some kind of dream.

10:39.374 --> 10:43.931
Well, well, well sheriff, fancy
seeing a man of your sober disposition

10:43.932 --> 10:46.370
in a low down drinking establishemnt.

10:48.368 --> 10:51.374
Now, now boys, I don't want any
trouble. Just doing my rounds.

10:58.373 --> 11:00.373
You shouldn't ought to have done that Jimmy.

11:04.371 --> 11:07.911
Why don't you try it, Sheriff.
They say you used to be faster

11:07.912 --> 11:10.366
than a toilet stop in
rattlesnake country.

11:12.369 --> 11:14.561
Sorry I tripped over your
boot there Mr Jimmy sir.

11:14.562 --> 11:16.367
Arrrhhheeemm. Didn't
mean any harm by it.

11:19.371 --> 11:21.500
Give me two fingers of
your best sipping liquor,

11:21.501 --> 11:23.281
Miss Lola, and make it the smooth stuff.

11:23.282 --> 11:26.365
The stuff where you get your eyesight
back after two days. Guaranteed.

11:28.367 --> 11:33.370
The Apocalypse boys is here.
They's asking for you, Sheriff.

11:34.365 --> 11:35.365
I'll be right out.

11:48.363 --> 11:49.769
I don't believe I've
had the pleasures, sirs.

11:55.366 --> 11:59.770
The name's Death. And these
here're my brothers. Brother War...

12:02.364 --> 12:03.064
Brother Famine...

12:05.366 --> 12:06.365
and Brother Pestilence.

12:08.363 --> 12:11.366
Well, you seem like a nice neighbourly
bunch of boys. How can I be of service?

12:19.361 --> 12:23.362
We want your sorry ass out
of here. You got one hour.

12:40.472 --> 12:44.471
Twice in one lifetime!
When you're hot, you're hot.

12:45.471 --> 12:48.660
If we link up the artificial
reality console to Kryten's mind,

12:48.661 --> 12:51.648
we should be able to project
directly into his dream state

12:51.649 --> 12:53.470
like it was a normal computer game.

12:53.505 --> 12:56.472
What did I tell you? We don't
even have to leave the room!

12:56.507 --> 12:57.441
What about me?

12:57.476 --> 13:00.516
We'll shut all extraneous systems
and power up your hard light drive.

13:00.517 --> 13:02.471
Come on guys, lets get
these wagons rolling.

13:05.473 --> 13:07.719
There we go, I've
loaded in some characters

13:07.720 --> 13:10.476
from an AR western game.
Choose a player from 1 to 3.

13:11.470 --> 13:12.270
Two.

13:12.474 --> 13:17.472
Here you go, you're the Riveria Kid,
special skills ace gun slinger. Rimsy?

13:17.507 --> 13:18.472
Uno.

13:19.475 --> 13:26.735
One. Dangerous Dan McGrew,special
skills, bare fist fighting.

13:26.736 --> 13:32.473
Which leaves me with
Brett Riverboat, knife man.

13:32.508 --> 13:33.472
And we definitely can't get hurt?

13:34.512 --> 13:39.706
No, it's just like a normal computer
game, you can get out at anytime.

13:39.707 --> 13:44.900
There's a button on the inside of
the glove, when you want to get out,

13:44.901 --> 13:49.508
just clap. OK, Riveria, OK
Dangerous. Lets mosey on into town.

14:17.506 --> 14:20.507
I've seen Westerns, I
know how to speak cowboy.

14:29.503 --> 14:32.502
Dry white wine and Perrier please.
And what about you two chaps?

14:33.506 --> 14:36.504
Rimmer, what westerns have you seen?
Butch Accountant and the Yuppie Kid?

14:37.503 --> 14:42.503
Leave this to me, this sounds
like one for the Riveria Kid!

14:45.511 --> 14:48.501
Ehhh, Senorita, re-tequila por favor.

14:59.856 --> 15:00.757
Very smooth.

15:01.556 --> 15:04.560
I was expecting something
with a little more kick to it.

15:05.562 --> 15:07.558
I don't suppose you've
got any ginger ale mixers.

15:08.558 --> 15:10.556
I'll take that as a no
then, I'll have it neat.

15:30.577 --> 15:32.573
Sorry, what were the choices again?

15:34.577 --> 15:37.573
You'll have to forgive our friend, he's
a souple of Gunmen short of a posse.

15:38.580 --> 15:41.577
OK. You're a fat bearded git with
breath that could knock-out a grizzly.

15:42.606 --> 15:44.601
Take the lot, man. Rimmer,
what is wrong with you?

15:45.605 --> 15:48.605
Relax! You said yourself,
Lister, no-one can hurt us.

15:48.606 --> 15:51.639
Besides, you're forgetting:
I'm Dangerous Dan McGrew,

15:51.640 --> 15:53.605
Bare Fist Fighter Extra-ordinaire.

15:59.600 --> 16:02.076
Here Lola, all my valuables
are in this here box.

16:02.077 --> 16:04.602
You can have it all for
one bottle of mind rotter.

16:05.611 --> 16:06.611
Mr Sad Git or what?

16:10.606 --> 16:11.612
Kryten it's us, man.

16:12.606 --> 16:13.611
Sorry friend, I don't
believe I've had the pleasure.

16:14.609 --> 16:17.564
Kryten, don't you know who
we are, why you're here?

16:17.565 --> 16:21.940
You're fighting an electronic virus,
you're trying to create a dove program.

16:21.941 --> 16:24.610
Some sort of software
antidote to wipe it out.

16:25.606 --> 16:26.306
I'll drink to that.

16:27.608 --> 16:28.940
Listen to him pooch head,
the virus is winning,

16:28.941 --> 16:30.606
you've got to get your head
together and start fighting it.

16:34.610 --> 16:36.609
Want a drink Sheriff? Why
don't you come and take one?

16:37.605 --> 16:40.625
Now now Jimmy, there's no need
to be going make me look foolish.

16:41.621 --> 16:44.620
Come on Sheriff, jump! You
can get higher than that!

16:45.619 --> 16:46.319
Leave him alone.

16:47.623 --> 16:50.621
Just having a little fun, Mr Swankypants.

16:51.619 --> 16:56.619
The names Brett Riverboat,
knifeman. Let's see how good you are.

17:04.617 --> 17:05.318
Son of a...

17:12.619 --> 17:15.622
Frank, Nuke, line his lungs with lead.

17:19.618 --> 17:20.586
Who in the heck are you?

17:20.621 --> 17:23.621
The call me the Kid, the Riveria Kid!

17:25.632 --> 17:30.621
Well, Riveria Kid, let's see if your
shooting is a fancy as your dancing.

17:42.614 --> 17:43.619
He shot the damn bullets out of the air!

17:45.616 --> 17:47.917
Well, it's been mighty
dandy meeting you boys,

17:47.918 --> 17:49.680
but if I'm not out of here by sun-up

17:49.681 --> 17:52.618
the buzzards will be fighting
the lizards for my gizzards.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.622
If he leaves town, we're dead. Stop him!

18:12.690 --> 18:13.690
Marvellous.

18:15.693 --> 18:16.696
Hey buddy!

18:16.731 --> 18:17.665
Hold it!

18:17.700 --> 18:18.656
You gotta stay!

18:18.691 --> 18:21.694
This is a job for the Riveria Kid!

18:32.697 --> 18:35.689
But boys you don't understand, I've
got to leave. Look it's ten to Death.

18:36.690 --> 18:38.697
OK, we've got ten minutes to sober
him up and get him in shape. Come on.

18:42.721 --> 18:48.321
This is it Kryten, the answer's in
these guns somehow. Doves, dove program.

18:49.222 --> 18:51.422
I don't know, I really don't know.

18:53.374 --> 18:56.297
Wait, somethings coming
back now. You sir.

18:56.898 --> 19:01.191
Whenever I look at you I get an image
of curry and early morning breath

19:01.192 --> 19:03.637
that could cut through bank vaults.

19:04.038 --> 19:08.673
You sir. There's something familiar
about you too, I get a name,

19:09.274 --> 19:12.721
SmmmEE, SmmEEgGG HHHeeeDD.

19:12.756 --> 19:13.723
Smeghead?

19:14.686 --> 19:15.386
That's it!

19:15.421 --> 19:16.223
He remembers me.

19:17.726 --> 19:19.689
The guns Kryten, do the
guns mean anything to you?

19:19.724 --> 19:23.721
Something, they mean something...
if only I had more time.

19:23.756 --> 19:25.724
PSSSTTT, company.

19:51.252 --> 19:52.254
Got yourself a little help there, Sheriff?

19:53.256 --> 19:57.631
Now I remember you. You're a computer
virus, travelling from machine to machine,

19:57.632 --> 19:59.251
overwriting the core program.

20:00.251 --> 20:02.327
Have infection, will travel: that's me.

20:02.328 --> 20:05.254
Lets see if we can't tip
the balance here a little...

20:13.248 --> 20:13.948
What is he doing?

20:15.161 --> 20:20.225
He's stalling. He's
spotted us for what we are,

20:20.226 --> 20:24.657
a bunch of mean macho
bad ass desperados.

20:24.658 --> 20:29.775
We're going to kick his boney
butt clean across the town. Enjoy the show.

20:35.476 --> 20:37.210
Who's got the
guts to go with me one on one,

20:37.211 --> 20:40.164
hand to hand, mano a mano?

20:48.158 --> 20:49.167
Damn, I've lost my special skills.

21:08.163 --> 21:11.157
Rimmer, the virus has spread to the
AR unit. We've lost our special skills.

21:14.661 --> 21:15.711
Ahhh, Mr War sir, it would appear

21:15.712 --> 21:18.387
that due to circumstances
completely beyond my control,

21:18.388 --> 21:21.158
there's been a bit of a cock
up in the bravado department.

21:24.160 --> 21:27.157
I may indeed have come across as
being more brave than in fact I am.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.156
Exit, exit.

21:43.158 --> 21:44.155
We're sealed in.

21:45.155 --> 21:46.156
Get the helmets off.

21:49.156 --> 21:50.167
It won't move.

21:51.763 --> 21:52.863
Cat the back.

21:58.154 --> 22:03.604
I got one of my gloves
off... and a boot too.

22:04.605 --> 22:08.205
Ohh brilliant, now you're paralysed
compeletely down your left hand side.

22:10.601 --> 22:11.567
Ohhh, me nose!

22:11.602 --> 22:12.570
I've almost got it.

22:12.605 --> 22:13.609
You're pulling my nose off!

22:13.644 --> 22:14.567
Here it comes.

22:14.602 --> 22:15.600
The helmet's coming off.

22:24.607 --> 22:27.603
We're gonna cut you up so small the
worms aren't even going to have to chew.

22:28.606 --> 22:31.604
You can't frighten me, I'm
always scared. LISTERRRRR!

22:34.605 --> 22:35.568
What now?

22:35.603 --> 22:36.600
It's down to Kryten.

22:38.603 --> 22:41.571
Well Sheriff. Now it's just little old you.

22:41.606 --> 22:46.217
I'm not afraid Mr Death sir. I believe
my friends have bought me enough time

22:46.218 --> 22:48.194
to complete the antidote program.

22:48.195 --> 22:51.941
Now, if you'll forgive the
rather confrontational imperative,

22:51.942 --> 22:54.600
go for your guns you
scum sucking mollascs.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.597
I did it! I created an antidote.

23:10.596 --> 23:11.611
Two minutes till impact. Come on!

23:23.899 --> 23:24.855
How long will it take?

23:24.890 --> 23:26.893
Just a few seconds. How long to impact?

23:27.895 --> 23:28.595
Just a few seconds.

23:29.892 --> 23:31.893
Loading it up... it's
going into the navicomp.

23:31.928 --> 23:32.895
Eight seconds. Seven.

23:32.903 --> 23:33.863
Nearly there.

23:33.898 --> 23:35.904
Five. Four. Three. Two.

23:36.902 --> 23:37.802
We're not going to make it!

23:37.899 --> 23:38.902
IMPACT.

23:50.900 --> 23:55.897
YEEEEEEHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
