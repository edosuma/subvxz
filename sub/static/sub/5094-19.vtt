00:13.389 --> 00:14.955
You see anybody running away
from the vehicle

00:14.957 --> 00:16.056
when you found
the body?

00:16.058 --> 00:17.424
No. No, sir.
All right.

00:17.426 --> 00:19.426
Officer Callaghan's gonna
take you down to the squad.

00:19.428 --> 00:20.828
I'll be down there
to talk to you soon.

00:20.830 --> 00:22.730
I thought this was one
of the safest big cities.

00:22.732 --> 00:24.431
Well, it's still
a big city.

00:24.433 --> 00:25.566
Hey.
What do we got?

00:25.568 --> 00:28.335
Uh, car's registered
to a Benjamin Daniels.

00:28.337 --> 00:29.770
Put it together with
the parking stickers

00:29.772 --> 00:31.171
and the stack
of graded papers,

00:31.173 --> 00:32.606
he was an
English professor

00:32.607 --> 00:34.208
at Hudson University.

00:34.210 --> 00:35.142
Did you get his wallet?

00:35.144 --> 00:36.343
Well, it's
not here.

00:36.345 --> 00:38.078
Wallet, watch...
gone.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.847
Weapon?
No, no.

00:39.849 --> 00:41.415
Canvassing the neighborhood.

00:41.417 --> 00:44.018
MLI clocks time of death
approximately 2330,

00:44.020 --> 00:46.220
so I'm guessing it was
pretty deserted around here.

00:46.222 --> 00:47.721
They get his cell phone, too?

00:47.723 --> 00:48.822
No, that's the thing.

00:48.824 --> 00:50.291
We have his phone?

00:50.293 --> 00:51.892
We have both his phones.

00:51.894 --> 00:53.160
<i>Both</i> his phones?

00:53.162 --> 00:54.728
There was one in the cup holder,

00:54.730 --> 00:56.664
and a burner in
the glove box.

00:56.666 --> 00:57.731
An English teacher
with two phones.

00:57.733 --> 00:59.099
So the question becomes...

00:59.101 --> 01:02.102
What's this English professor
doing with two phones?

01:02.104 --> 01:05.205
I'd say he's talking out of
both sides of his mouth.

01:05.206 --> 01:07.107
Mike! Yo!

01:07.109 --> 01:10.177
Yo, Mike!

01:10.179 --> 01:13.414
Mike! Yo!

01:13.416 --> 01:15.282
Well, it took you long enough!
Mike!

01:15.284 --> 01:16.650
What seems to be the problem?
Yo, Mike!

01:16.652 --> 01:18.552
She's been yelling like that
for the past two hours.

01:18.554 --> 01:19.653
Mike!

01:19.655 --> 01:20.621
I don't think
a Mike

01:20.623 --> 01:21.989
even lives in that building.

01:21.991 --> 01:24.158
Well, did you tell her to stop?

01:24.160 --> 01:25.326
Only about a dozen times.

01:25.328 --> 01:26.860
Mike...
Listen, my granddaughter

01:26.862 --> 01:28.395
is trying to sleep upstairs.
Mike, yo!

01:28.397 --> 01:30.497
Okay. Hey, miss.
Yo!

01:30.499 --> 01:31.865
I think you need
to take a break.

01:31.867 --> 01:33.534
I'm looking for Mike.

01:33.536 --> 01:35.102
Yeah, he's clearly
not looking for you.

01:35.104 --> 01:36.870
Mike! Yo!

01:36.872 --> 01:38.339
Miss, I need you
to give it a rest.

01:38.341 --> 01:39.940
Says who?
Says me,

01:39.942 --> 01:41.208
Officer Reagan.

01:41.210 --> 01:42.676
Ma'am, you need to stop.

01:42.678 --> 01:43.911
You're disturbing
the whole block.

01:43.913 --> 01:46.413
Mike, you gotta come down!
Mike!

01:46.415 --> 01:47.615
All right, ma'am, listen,
I don't want to have

01:47.617 --> 01:48.949
to write you a summons, okay?

01:48.951 --> 01:50.618
Leave me alone!
Hey! Hey, all right.

01:50.620 --> 01:51.752
All right, you're
coming with us.

01:51.754 --> 01:53.420
Ow! Hey!

01:56.525 --> 01:58.025
Mike!

01:58.027 --> 01:59.093
Ah, she bit me!
She bit you?

01:59.095 --> 02:00.127
Mike!

02:01.297 --> 02:02.296
Listen to me.

02:02.298 --> 02:03.664
If you ever try and bite me,

02:03.666 --> 02:05.699
that will be the last
solid food you ever eat,

02:05.701 --> 02:06.800
you understand?

02:06.802 --> 02:07.801
Mike!

02:07.803 --> 02:09.937
Yo!

02:09.939 --> 02:12.473
They're takin' me away, Mike!

02:19.048 --> 02:20.714
ADA Reagan
to see you, sir.

02:20.716 --> 02:22.249
Well.

02:22.251 --> 02:23.384
Let's have her.

02:23.386 --> 02:25.519
Erin, he's all yours.

02:26.655 --> 02:28.155
Pleasant surprise.

02:28.157 --> 02:30.324
Well, not for long.

02:30.326 --> 02:32.026
Want some coffee?

02:32.028 --> 02:34.228
This meeting
never happened.

02:34.230 --> 02:35.929
Well, as far as I can tell,

02:35.931 --> 02:37.998
you're just a dutiful daughter

02:38.000 --> 02:40.701
checking in on her dear ol' dad.

02:40.703 --> 02:42.403
Heard in the halls

02:42.405 --> 02:43.904
that you have five detectives

02:43.906 --> 02:46.674
who are having remarkable
success at getting statements,

02:46.676 --> 02:49.443
tips and confessions
through interrogations.

02:49.445 --> 02:51.278
Can't argue with success.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.213
Actually,
the DA can.

02:53.215 --> 02:54.481
He's likened these detectives

02:54.483 --> 02:57.351
to baseball players
batting .700.

02:57.353 --> 03:00.654
Not likely,
unless they're juicing.

03:00.656 --> 03:04.324
The DA is considering
launching an investigation.

03:04.326 --> 03:06.827
The NYPD has an arm for that.

03:06.829 --> 03:08.362
So does the DA's office.

03:08.364 --> 03:09.863
Guess who wins?

03:11.566 --> 03:13.534
And I can't call him
on it, can I?

03:13.536 --> 03:16.804
We would both be compromised.

03:18.873 --> 03:21.408
Because Danny's on the list.

This just doesn't

We have theater tickets
for Tuesday.

04:05.738 --> 04:08.472
I don't know
what my life is now.

04:08.474 --> 04:10.641
Again, we're very sorry
for your loss, ma'am.

04:10.643 --> 04:12.476
How long were
you married?

04:12.478 --> 04:16.680
Uh, w-we were coming up on 30.

04:16.682 --> 04:19.583
We met in grad school
when he was a young poet,

04:19.584 --> 04:21.584
we got tenure together

04:21.587 --> 04:22.920
here at Hudson.

04:22.922 --> 04:24.121
It was a...

04:24.123 --> 04:25.122
it was a very,

04:25.124 --> 04:27.324
very long, loving romance.

04:28.827 --> 04:31.996
You should see the poems
he wrote me.

04:32.831 --> 04:34.031
Your daughter?

04:34.933 --> 04:37.134
Oh, God.

04:37.136 --> 04:39.503
I, uh, I have to go call her.

04:39.505 --> 04:40.704
Mrs. Daniels,

04:40.706 --> 04:41.972
we want to respect your privacy,

04:41.974 --> 04:43.140
and we will,

04:43.142 --> 04:44.775
but we do have some
important questions

04:44.777 --> 04:46.377
to ask first, if you don't mind.

04:50.448 --> 04:53.617
Do you know what your husband
was doing last night?

04:53.619 --> 04:58.022
Uh, he... uh, told me
he had to work late

04:58.024 --> 04:59.657
and not to wait up.

04:59.659 --> 05:02.292
So you were here alone,
by yourself?

05:02.294 --> 05:05.362
Yes, I taught a class
until around 8:00.

05:05.364 --> 05:06.630
Then I came home, I...

05:06.632 --> 05:08.699
prepped for
a lecture,

05:08.701 --> 05:09.733
fell asleep early.

05:09.735 --> 05:11.835
Do you know
if your husband

05:11.837 --> 05:14.271
had any issues
with gambling or drugs?

05:14.273 --> 05:15.906
No. That's not Benjamin.

05:15.908 --> 05:18.208
Why would you ask that?

05:18.210 --> 05:19.910
When one person has two phones,

05:19.912 --> 05:21.245
these are things we look at.

05:21.247 --> 05:24.014
Well, no, Benjamin
only has one cell phone.

05:24.016 --> 05:25.983
There were two phones
in his car.

05:25.985 --> 05:28.385
Excuse me.

05:28.387 --> 05:29.687
He is a good man,

05:29.689 --> 05:32.222
a wonderful father,
an excellent

05:32.224 --> 05:33.257
husband.

05:33.259 --> 05:34.391
He is the victim here.

05:34.393 --> 05:36.360
He is the victim here, ma'am.

05:36.362 --> 05:39.163
And all we're trying to do
is find out who's responsible.

05:39.165 --> 05:41.065
Hello? Val?

05:42.400 --> 05:43.367
Valerie,

05:43.369 --> 05:46.036
I'm so sorry.
God, Seymour.

05:47.272 --> 05:49.106
I just heard.
President Winters

05:49.108 --> 05:50.708
contacted the trustees.
Oh.

05:50.710 --> 05:53.944
Seymour, these are
Detectives Reagan and Baez.

05:53.946 --> 05:55.312
I'm Seymour
Kerwin.

05:55.314 --> 05:57.915
I... can't
believe it.

05:57.917 --> 05:59.817
I just saw
him last night.

05:59.819 --> 06:00.951
Where was that?

06:00.953 --> 06:03.387
We had a committee meeting

06:03.389 --> 06:04.755
at the administration building.

06:04.757 --> 06:06.090
What time?

06:06.092 --> 06:07.658
Meeting
was at 6:00,

06:07.660 --> 06:10.027
wrapped up
around 7:30.

06:10.029 --> 06:11.862
We had a drink afterwards
in his office.

06:11.864 --> 06:14.465
I guess I left
him around 9:00.

06:14.467 --> 06:16.133
Did he have plans
he talked about?

06:16.135 --> 06:17.701
Any stops before home?

06:17.703 --> 06:20.237
No, nothing.

06:21.574 --> 06:22.639
I'm sorry.

06:22.641 --> 06:23.640
I-I'm still trying

06:23.642 --> 06:25.442
to process this.

06:25.444 --> 06:26.577
We were close.

06:26.579 --> 06:28.412
Detectives,
I have to go

06:28.414 --> 06:29.580
call my daughter now.

06:29.582 --> 06:30.748
Of course.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.249
We'll be in touch
later this evening.

06:32.251 --> 06:33.383
Yes. Uh, Seymour,

06:33.385 --> 06:35.152
would you show
the detectives out, please?

06:38.891 --> 06:40.057
Detectives?

06:42.260 --> 06:45.095
The dump came back
on Daniels' phones.

06:45.097 --> 06:46.430
The second was a burner
he only used

06:46.432 --> 06:48.065
to communicate
with one other number,

06:48.067 --> 06:49.900
another burner,
now out of service.

06:49.902 --> 06:51.635
Well, everyone's entitled
to a private life.

06:51.637 --> 06:55.405
A secret life?
You're on your own.

07:11.823 --> 07:13.490
Here, let me
put that...

07:13.492 --> 07:14.491
I'll just

07:14.493 --> 07:16.193
file this.

07:16.195 --> 07:17.828
Over here.

07:20.965 --> 07:23.500
Anything new from
the DA's office?

07:23.502 --> 07:24.635
No.

07:24.637 --> 07:25.969
Did your source
give you any sense

07:25.971 --> 07:27.304
of how far along

07:27.306 --> 07:28.605
the investigation
has progressed?

07:28.607 --> 07:32.009
The word "preliminary" was used.

07:32.011 --> 07:33.377
Shift your weight.

07:33.379 --> 07:35.512
What if Danny
wasn't on this list?

07:35.514 --> 07:38.348
I would do everything
in my power

07:38.350 --> 07:40.017
to protect a detective

07:40.019 --> 07:41.418
who was under the microscope

07:41.420 --> 07:42.953
for being good at his job.

07:42.955 --> 07:45.656
Do you think Detective Reagan
steps over the line?

07:47.726 --> 07:51.328
I think he probably
steps <i>on</i> the line.

07:52.797 --> 07:54.331
But more importantly,

07:54.333 --> 07:56.133
what I do know

07:56.135 --> 07:57.768
is what I don't know.

07:57.770 --> 07:59.603
Namely,

07:59.605 --> 08:01.772
every move he makes.

08:01.774 --> 08:04.241
And you have to wonder
how the DA's office

08:04.243 --> 08:05.809
is going to define that line.

08:05.811 --> 08:07.811
It is clearly defined

08:07.813 --> 08:09.713
as constitutional law.

08:09.715 --> 08:11.048
I hope Danny's
familiar with them.

08:11.050 --> 08:13.317
I made sure of that.

08:15.521 --> 08:17.688
But he takes the job personally.

08:17.690 --> 08:19.156
Didn't you, Frank?

08:19.158 --> 08:21.792
I did.

08:21.794 --> 08:25.062
But Danny is quick
to the temper.

08:25.064 --> 08:26.563
He came out that way.

08:26.565 --> 08:27.598
Colicky baby,

08:27.600 --> 08:29.499
hyperactive kid,

08:29.501 --> 08:31.702
rebellious teenager,
gung ho Marine.

08:31.704 --> 08:33.070
Great cop.

08:33.072 --> 08:34.605
No argument here.

08:34.607 --> 08:37.006
I don't know what to tell you.

08:37.009 --> 08:38.375
I need a sounding board,
Garrett.

08:38.376 --> 08:40.244
I'm not looking for advice.

08:40.246 --> 08:42.813
I'm going to give you
some anyway.

08:43.648 --> 08:44.848
All right.

08:44.850 --> 08:46.116
It occurs to me
that you should

08:46.118 --> 08:49.253
be having this off-the-record
meeting with your son.

08:53.925 --> 08:55.559
Let's get her processed

08:55.561 --> 08:56.727
and then get you
checked for rabies.

08:56.729 --> 08:58.695
Yeah.
Jamie!

08:58.697 --> 09:00.097
Hey!

09:00.099 --> 09:01.064
Is that really you?

09:01.066 --> 09:01.999
Hey, man,
what's going on?

09:02.001 --> 09:03.233
I thought we
weren't hanging out

09:03.235 --> 09:05.102
until later tonight,
when I get off work.

09:06.371 --> 09:07.671
And boy, do I think
I need a picture

09:07.673 --> 09:09.106
to send the rest of the guys.

09:09.108 --> 09:10.574
No pictures, no pictures. No pictures.
All right, all right!

09:10.576 --> 09:13.110
Mental picture's
enough.

09:13.112 --> 09:14.478
- And who is this?
- Oh, my bad.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.746
This is my partner Eddie.

09:17.148 --> 09:18.415
Oh, so you get
the prettiest partner

09:18.417 --> 09:19.483
because you're
the commissioner's son?

09:19.485 --> 09:21.952
Eddie, this is my
friend Spencer Croft.

09:21.954 --> 09:23.153
It's nice to meet you.

09:23.155 --> 09:24.922
We lived together
at Harvard.

09:24.924 --> 09:26.123
But now he's
a venture capitalist

09:26.125 --> 09:27.758
in from California
to gyp some whiz kids.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.526
Oh, impressive.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.028
I swear it sounds
fancier than it is.

09:31.030 --> 09:33.463
I'm low on the
totem pole, trust me.

09:33.465 --> 09:35.299
They make me wash the jet
before I ride in it.

09:36.635 --> 09:37.601
You're funny.

09:37.603 --> 09:38.635
Jamie got the smarts

09:38.637 --> 09:40.771
and the looks
and I got the funny.

09:40.773 --> 09:42.072
Not that funny.

09:42.074 --> 09:43.407
Ouch.

09:43.409 --> 09:45.275
Hey!

09:45.277 --> 09:46.243
I gotta pee!

09:46.245 --> 09:47.544
All right, well,

09:47.546 --> 09:48.679
duty calls.

09:48.681 --> 09:50.514
I guess we better go
process vampire girl.

09:50.516 --> 09:51.949
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm on it.

09:51.951 --> 09:53.617
Spencer, I'll see you tonight.
Sounds good.

09:53.619 --> 09:55.752
It was nice meeting you,
Officer Eddie.

09:55.754 --> 09:57.387
It's Janko.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.655
It sure is.

09:59.992 --> 10:02.960
All right, let's go,
Officer Eddie.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.263
Bye.

10:08.633 --> 10:11.168
Okay, been looking through

10:11.170 --> 10:12.703
Benjamin Daniels' computer here,

10:12.705 --> 10:14.004
subpoenaed his ISP,

10:14.006 --> 10:15.772
got a dump on his history.

10:15.774 --> 10:17.874
Nothing unusual,

10:17.876 --> 10:20.177
except for his
most trafficked site.

10:22.114 --> 10:23.347
"The Winifred O'Daire

10:23.349 --> 10:25.382
Scholarship Fund for
Promising Young Women."

10:25.384 --> 10:27.484
He teaches college.
What's unusual?

10:27.486 --> 10:29.319
Watch what happens
when I click on her...

10:29.321 --> 10:31.221
lady business.

10:31.223 --> 10:33.190
Why you clicking on
her lady business?

10:35.728 --> 10:37.160
Doubt this is

10:37.162 --> 10:38.395
a merit scholarship.

10:38.397 --> 10:40.530
I was just about to work on
cracking the login,

10:40.532 --> 10:42.466
which will take me
either two days...

10:42.468 --> 10:43.834
or two minutes.

10:48.039 --> 10:49.639
These are the
scholarship girls?

10:49.641 --> 10:51.008
Where are the ugly ones?

10:51.010 --> 10:52.442
Click on one of them.

10:52.444 --> 10:53.944
Rebecca...

10:53.946 --> 10:55.645
looks about 19...

10:55.647 --> 10:57.848
She look like
a physics major to you?

10:59.017 --> 11:01.018
This is an escort service.

11:01.020 --> 11:02.652
So Daniels <i>was</i> having an affair.

11:02.654 --> 11:04.321
With a "promising young woman."

11:04.323 --> 11:06.957
I have a feeling I know
exactly what she was promising.

11:06.959 --> 11:08.291
See if you can track
down whoever it is

11:08.293 --> 11:10.560
that's running this...
scholarship fund.

11:11.697 --> 11:13.730
Whoever it is
knows what they're doing.

11:13.732 --> 11:16.333
Got the location
pretty well cloaked.

11:16.335 --> 11:19.369
You know, I may be an idiot,
but don't these nonprofits

11:19.371 --> 11:21.605
have to report donations
of a certain size somewhere?

11:21.607 --> 11:22.973
Yeah, they do.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.908
Here's a list of major donors.

11:24.910 --> 11:28.245
Donors, huh?

11:28.247 --> 11:30.113
You mean a list of the johns.

11:30.115 --> 11:32.516
All right.
Look who we got here.

11:32.518 --> 11:35.352
Benjamin Daniels
right next to Seymour Kerwin.

11:35.354 --> 11:36.686
The guy we met at
Daniels' apartment.

11:36.688 --> 11:38.188
Who didn't know
nothing about nothing.

11:38.190 --> 11:39.423
Exactly.

11:39.425 --> 11:42.592
The secret to keeping
a secret life secret.

11:59.977 --> 12:03.113
I think that's our guy.

12:03.115 --> 12:05.581
Mr. Kerwin?

12:05.582 --> 12:07.148
We need to talk
to you for a second.

12:07.150 --> 12:08.416
I-I'm sorry, I'm-I'm just,

12:08.418 --> 12:09.884
uh, going in for a meeting.

12:09.886 --> 12:11.319
Ah, well, it's about
the Winifred O'Daire

12:11.321 --> 12:12.520
Scholarship Fund.

12:14.891 --> 12:17.325
Uh, let's have a
word over here.

12:17.327 --> 12:19.493
Great.

12:21.063 --> 12:24.465
First of all,
it's not prostitution.

12:24.467 --> 12:26.033
Everybody's
a consenting adult,

12:26.035 --> 12:27.368
and happy to be involved.

12:27.370 --> 12:29.470
Is that a wedding band
you're wearing?

12:29.472 --> 12:31.906
My wife hasn't touched me
since the Reagan Administration.

12:31.908 --> 12:34.275
Okay, why don't you tell us
about the scholarship?

12:34.277 --> 12:35.676
How does it work?

12:35.678 --> 12:38.279
There's this guy.

12:38.281 --> 12:40.781
He's like a matchmaker.

12:40.783 --> 12:43.851
He picks the right girl for you.

12:43.853 --> 12:45.987
Then you have dinner.
It's like a date.

12:45.989 --> 12:47.655
You see if you hit it off.

12:47.657 --> 12:48.789
If you have
any common interests.

12:48.791 --> 12:50.524
And if it's the right fit...

12:50.526 --> 12:52.526
Right. No pun intended.

12:52.528 --> 12:54.128
Don't make it dirty.

12:54.130 --> 12:55.129
It's not dirty.

12:55.131 --> 12:57.131
Come on, we know what
this is all about.

12:57.133 --> 12:58.132
It's not just about sex.

12:58.134 --> 13:00.768
Sometimes it's just dinner.

13:00.770 --> 13:02.236
Some-sometimes there's nothing.

13:02.238 --> 13:04.672
She's tired, I'm tired.

13:05.841 --> 13:08.476
You miss that,
having a girlfriend.

13:08.478 --> 13:11.479
Someone who thinks you're smart.

13:11.481 --> 13:13.748
Who looks up to you.

13:13.750 --> 13:15.116
Who cares about you.

13:15.118 --> 13:16.717
You miss that.

13:16.719 --> 13:18.886
Okay.

13:18.888 --> 13:20.922
What's the name of the girl
Benjamin was seeing?

13:20.924 --> 13:23.090
Her name's, uh, Maggie.

13:23.092 --> 13:25.192
I don't know her last name.
I swear.

13:25.194 --> 13:26.994
Who's behind
The Winifred O'Daire

13:26.996 --> 13:28.262
Scholarship Fund?

13:28.264 --> 13:30.398
I was introduced
to the guy by Benjamin.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.534
He runs the whole thing
out of a coffee shop.

13:33.536 --> 13:35.670
This guy have a name?
I don't know his name.

13:35.672 --> 13:39.206
But the coffee shop is called
The Unlucky Penny.

13:39.208 --> 13:40.841
It's in Greenpoint.

13:40.843 --> 13:42.009
All right.

13:42.011 --> 13:43.177
The heart wants

13:43.179 --> 13:45.413
what it wants.

13:45.415 --> 13:48.349
Whatever you say.

13:48.351 --> 13:50.151
What's that? Chicken?

13:50.153 --> 13:52.086
You don't want to do that.

13:52.088 --> 13:54.188
Ah, doesn't seem to bother you.

13:54.190 --> 13:56.023
Trust me.

14:02.598 --> 14:04.198
Take some rice.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.900
Mm.

14:05.902 --> 14:07.735
Wow, that was hot.

14:07.737 --> 14:10.338
You okay?
Mm-hmm.

14:10.340 --> 14:13.674
Sergeant...

14:13.676 --> 14:16.477
Detective Reagan
has extraordinary success

14:16.479 --> 14:18.512
in getting results, doesn't he?

14:18.514 --> 14:20.848
Yeah, you could say so.

14:20.850 --> 14:23.150
Why do you think that is?

14:23.152 --> 14:25.720
Well, he's like a good salesman.

14:25.722 --> 14:28.255
He sees the customers,

14:28.257 --> 14:31.092
knows if they need
a hard or a harder sell.

14:31.094 --> 14:33.661
Do you think
he ever goes too far

14:33.663 --> 14:35.596
to try and make a sale?

14:35.598 --> 14:36.864
He can get pretty
loud in the box,

14:36.866 --> 14:39.367
but, uh, I never saw
anybody coming out

14:39.369 --> 14:41.035
looking worse
than when he went in.

14:41.037 --> 14:42.837
And he gets fewer

14:42.839 --> 14:44.605
civilian complaints
filed against him

14:44.607 --> 14:46.807
than a lot of less
productive guys.

14:46.809 --> 14:49.944
Or maybe they just get lost?

14:49.946 --> 14:51.946
No, sir.

14:51.948 --> 14:54.148
Your neck ever get stiff
from looking the other way?

14:54.150 --> 14:55.783
No, sir.

14:57.786 --> 15:01.188
Commissioner, um,
to be honest,

15:01.190 --> 15:03.491
your son drives me nuts.

15:03.493 --> 15:05.326
You know?

15:05.328 --> 15:08.996
He's meticulous and sloppy
all at the same time.

15:08.998 --> 15:11.432
His paperwork is a salad.

15:11.434 --> 15:13.167
And half the time,

15:13.169 --> 15:15.770
I don't know where he is
and what he's doing.

15:15.772 --> 15:18.205
And he puts on three times
the amount of miles

15:18.207 --> 15:20.541
on the car than anybody
in the squad.

15:20.543 --> 15:22.443
But if you got any others

15:22.445 --> 15:26.113
like him at home,
please send them my way.

15:27.883 --> 15:30.684
I appreciate your candor.

15:30.686 --> 15:33.220
Is everything okay here, boss?

15:33.222 --> 15:35.856
I mean, anything
I should know about?

15:35.858 --> 15:38.526
Not at this time.

15:38.528 --> 15:40.828
Could you

15:40.830 --> 15:44.632
put together his case files
for pick up from my office?

15:44.634 --> 15:46.133
Yes, sir.

15:46.135 --> 15:48.035
Discreetly.

15:48.037 --> 15:50.071
Yes, sir.

15:50.073 --> 15:52.273
Thank you.

15:58.513 --> 16:00.381
Any ideas?

16:00.383 --> 16:03.551
Yeah, guy with the
hat in the back.

16:03.553 --> 16:05.486
Sure looks like
he's running

16:05.488 --> 16:07.321
a business.
Oh, yeah, two phones.

16:07.323 --> 16:08.789
Seems like an epidemic.

16:08.791 --> 16:10.491
I'm guessing one of
them's his hot spot.

16:10.493 --> 16:12.393
Sure beats working
out of a cubicle.

16:12.395 --> 16:13.961
Excuse me, sir.

16:13.963 --> 16:15.930
You mind if we step
into your little office?

16:15.932 --> 16:17.765
I'm kind of working here.

16:17.767 --> 16:18.866
Yeah, so are we.

16:18.868 --> 16:20.434
Detectives Reagan
and Baez.

16:20.436 --> 16:22.403
And you must be...

16:22.405 --> 16:24.438
Hey!

16:24.440 --> 16:26.740
...Jeremiah Kade.

16:26.742 --> 16:28.442
Why don't you tell us about

16:28.444 --> 16:30.678
the Winifred O'Daire sugar daddy
service you're running.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.713
It's a scholarship fund.

16:32.715 --> 16:35.182
Slash prostitution ring.

16:35.184 --> 16:36.917
I run an aboveboard

16:36.919 --> 16:38.419
nonprofit institution

16:38.421 --> 16:40.387
with a 501-C3 status.

16:40.389 --> 16:43.290
No, you pimp college girls
to old guys.

16:43.292 --> 16:44.325
That's what you do.

16:44.327 --> 16:46.427
All I do is

16:46.429 --> 16:47.862
match scholars with sponsors.

16:47.864 --> 16:50.498
What they do beyond that
is their own business.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.699
Okay, whatever.

16:51.701 --> 16:52.933
What's your end of it?

16:52.935 --> 16:55.302
There's an administrative fee.

16:55.304 --> 16:56.303
Ten percent.

16:56.305 --> 16:58.139
All that is a matter
of public record.

16:58.141 --> 16:59.974
Our girls get access
to an education

16:59.976 --> 17:02.443
they can't afford,
and our sponsors get

17:02.445 --> 17:03.677
the hands-on experience

17:03.679 --> 17:05.378
of shaping
the next generation.

17:05.381 --> 17:08.315
Yeah, we know what the hands-on
experience is all about.

17:08.317 --> 17:09.983
Look, Mr. Kade.

17:09.986 --> 17:11.452
We're here
to investigate a murder,

17:11.454 --> 17:12.853
a murder
of one of your sponsors,

17:12.855 --> 17:14.221
Benjamin Daniels.

17:14.223 --> 17:16.790
Who was he sponsoring?

17:16.791 --> 17:19.627
Any additional information,
you'll need a warrant.

17:19.628 --> 17:22.262
No, actually...

17:22.265 --> 17:24.165
Mr. Kade,

17:24.166 --> 17:26.534
what do you think would happen

17:26.536 --> 17:29.036
to your little service
if we were to,

17:29.038 --> 17:31.605
I don't know, release a
statement to the press

17:31.607 --> 17:35.276
tying your scholarship fund
to a murder, hmm?

17:35.278 --> 17:37.211
You'll leave me
and my business alone

17:37.213 --> 17:38.312
if I tell you?

17:38.314 --> 17:41.949
We're only investigating
a murder.

17:43.818 --> 17:46.153
Okay.

17:46.155 --> 17:47.922
He was sponsoring Maggie Parker.

17:49.124 --> 17:50.257
She's a junior at Hudson.

17:50.259 --> 17:51.892
Where Daniels worked.

17:51.894 --> 17:53.594
Let's go find her.

17:53.596 --> 17:55.329
And...

17:55.331 --> 17:57.298
you'll be hearing
from my buddy at the I.R.S.

17:57.300 --> 17:59.233
But he said
you'd leave me alone.

17:59.235 --> 18:01.936
He did. I didn't.

18:11.546 --> 18:13.047
Oh, somebody's sleepy.

18:13.049 --> 18:15.182
Ah, I stayed up way
too late last night

18:15.184 --> 18:16.317
catching up with Spencer.

18:16.319 --> 18:17.685
I haven't seen him
in a long time.

18:17.687 --> 18:19.720
Hmm, he seems cool.

18:19.722 --> 18:21.455
He sure thinks so.

18:21.457 --> 18:23.324
He asked me
to give him your digits.

18:23.326 --> 18:25.092
Seriously?
Yeah.

18:25.094 --> 18:26.093
For real?

18:26.095 --> 18:28.329
This is where you fish
for compliments?

18:28.331 --> 18:31.865
Seriously though, he's only
ever seen me in my uniform.

18:31.867 --> 18:33.100
I look like a 12-year-old boy

18:33.102 --> 18:34.868
dressing up like a cop
for Halloween.

18:34.870 --> 18:36.170
Whatever. It worked.

18:36.172 --> 18:37.671
So, did you give him my number?

18:37.673 --> 18:39.240
What are we,
back in middle school?

18:39.242 --> 18:41.875
I'm gonna start passing notes
for you guys?

18:41.877 --> 18:44.178
Just my number, Reagan.

18:44.180 --> 18:45.713
You don't need to say yes
because he's my friend.

18:45.715 --> 18:47.014
I'm not.

18:48.416 --> 18:51.285
Look, Spencer's a good friend,
but when it comes to women,

18:51.287 --> 18:53.254
he's a gentleman.

18:53.256 --> 18:55.723
Right up until he finds
another girl to be gentle with.

18:55.725 --> 18:58.058
I can handle myself.

18:58.060 --> 19:01.095
He wants to take you out
Sunday night if you're free.

19:01.097 --> 19:03.631
Hmm, I have plans

19:03.633 --> 19:06.500
with my old friend
from high school.

19:06.502 --> 19:08.535
I'll tell him it's a no.
Wait!

19:08.537 --> 19:09.770
Wait, wait, wait.
This is perfect!

19:09.772 --> 19:11.372
We could make it a double date.

19:11.374 --> 19:13.173
You would totally love Hayley.

19:13.175 --> 19:14.441
No, I don't know.
Trust me, trust me!

19:14.443 --> 19:16.010
She is awesome.

19:17.646 --> 19:20.047
I'm gonna text her right now.

19:20.049 --> 19:21.215
Will you let Spencer know?

19:21.217 --> 19:23.751
Sure, yeah.

19:32.961 --> 19:34.028
Maggie Parker?

19:34.030 --> 19:35.462
Detectives Reagan and Baez.

19:35.464 --> 19:36.964
What's going on?

19:36.966 --> 19:39.733
Professor Benjamin Daniels was
a friend of yours, right?

19:39.735 --> 19:41.402
Yes.

19:41.404 --> 19:42.770
Mind if we come talk inside?

19:44.873 --> 19:47.508
Wow, pretty nice place
you got here.

19:47.510 --> 19:48.842
Thank you.

19:48.844 --> 19:50.544
Better than living in a dorm.

19:50.546 --> 19:51.979
And so close to campus.

19:51.981 --> 19:54.114
Can't be too cheap though.

19:54.116 --> 19:55.449
I didn't know scholarships

19:55.451 --> 19:56.750
covered private housing.

19:56.752 --> 20:00.087
You know about the Winifred
O'Daire Scholarship?

20:00.089 --> 20:01.622
Yeah, we do.

20:01.624 --> 20:04.124
There's no law against friends
with benefits, is there?

20:04.126 --> 20:05.726
There is against prostitution.

20:05.728 --> 20:07.494
Yeah, this wasn't that.

20:07.496 --> 20:08.862
How so?

20:08.864 --> 20:10.431
He cared about
what I had to say.

20:10.433 --> 20:11.732
He was romantic.

20:11.734 --> 20:13.801
He took me on dates.
How many guys

20:13.803 --> 20:15.502
have ever written you
a love poem?

20:15.504 --> 20:18.105
Yeah, I'm sure the money didn't
hurt, either, though, did it?

20:18.107 --> 20:19.540
That was separate.
Right.

20:19.542 --> 20:21.942
When was the last time
you saw Mr. Daniels?

20:21.944 --> 20:24.278
Uh, we were together

20:24.280 --> 20:25.479
the night before last.

20:25.481 --> 20:26.880
The night he was murdered.

20:26.882 --> 20:29.683
Just tell us
what happened that night.

20:29.685 --> 20:31.719
He came over around 9:30.

20:31.721 --> 20:33.754
I was cramming for a mid-term,
he brought me sushi.

20:33.756 --> 20:37.024
And left around 11:00
when my friend came by to study.

20:37.026 --> 20:38.158
We're gonna need
the name and number

20:38.160 --> 20:39.426
of your friend
for starters.

20:39.428 --> 20:40.594
Sure.

20:40.596 --> 20:41.995
We're gonna need all
the text messages

20:41.997 --> 20:44.698
and e-mails between you
and Mr. Daniels as well.

20:45.567 --> 20:47.634
Those are private.

20:47.636 --> 20:48.669
Not anymore they're not.

20:48.671 --> 20:49.903
It's a murder investigation.

20:49.905 --> 20:51.238
You don't want
to turn them over,

20:51.240 --> 20:53.173
we'll have a subpoena
down here in a few minutes.

20:53.175 --> 20:55.209
I had nothing to do with it.

20:55.211 --> 20:57.044
I didn't say you did.

20:57.046 --> 20:58.045
My parents, they can't know.

20:58.047 --> 20:59.646
Look, I'll give you

20:59.648 --> 21:01.248
all the correspondence,
whatever you need.

21:01.250 --> 21:02.983
Just, please...

21:02.985 --> 21:04.618
You're obviously keeping
something from us.

21:04.620 --> 21:05.953
What do you mean?

21:05.955 --> 21:06.954
You're not cooperating
because you don't

21:06.956 --> 21:08.489
want us to tell your parents?

21:08.491 --> 21:09.823
This isn't some history exam

21:09.825 --> 21:11.325
where you get a "C"
and you don't want

21:11.327 --> 21:12.626
Mommy and Daddy to find out.
Somebody's dead.

21:12.628 --> 21:14.795
Somebody you
supposedly cared about.

21:14.797 --> 21:16.864
And you're standing in the
way of our investigation

21:16.866 --> 21:18.132
because you don't want us
to tell your parents?

21:18.134 --> 21:20.634
All right, all right.

21:20.636 --> 21:23.470
I broke up with my boyfriend,

21:23.472 --> 21:26.073
and he thought
it was because of Ben.

21:27.509 --> 21:29.610
Okay, this ex-boyfriend,

21:29.612 --> 21:31.345
what's his name?

21:32.180 --> 21:33.781
Milo.

21:33.783 --> 21:35.816
Milo Finley.

21:35.818 --> 21:37.584
He showed up last week
out of nowhere.

21:37.586 --> 21:39.553
Ben and I were
in the middle of...

21:39.555 --> 21:41.989
things.

21:41.991 --> 21:43.724
He went crazy.

21:43.726 --> 21:45.259
I had to call security.

21:45.261 --> 21:47.795
He called me a whore.

21:47.797 --> 21:49.163
And he threatened Benjamin.

21:49.165 --> 21:51.165
He must have gone
through with it.

21:59.908 --> 22:01.708
Hey.
Hey. I ran Milo Finley.

22:01.710 --> 22:03.510
Yeah? What'd
you come up with?

22:03.512 --> 22:06.513
23, college dropout.
Let's see.

22:06.515 --> 22:08.248
Jumped a turnstile,
drunk and disorderly,

22:08.250 --> 22:11.285
public urination.
You know, basic frat boy crap.

22:11.287 --> 22:12.653
No history of violence?

22:12.655 --> 22:14.688
No, but the dump on
Maggie's real phone said

22:14.690 --> 22:17.391
that Milo called her 108 times
after she broke up with him.

22:17.393 --> 22:18.525
You're kidding me.

22:18.527 --> 22:19.827
Detective Reagan.

22:19.829 --> 22:21.094
I'll catch up.

22:21.096 --> 22:22.362
You got a visitor.

22:22.364 --> 22:23.664
Oh, look who made bail.

22:23.666 --> 22:25.299
I got a cousin
who loves me.

22:25.301 --> 22:27.134
Good. I hope
you love him back.

22:27.136 --> 22:29.036
What's up?
I need to talk to you.

22:29.038 --> 22:30.838
All right, come on over
to my desk.

22:30.840 --> 22:31.872
Someplace private.

22:31.874 --> 22:34.274
Okay, we can talk
over here. Come on.

22:37.312 --> 22:38.579
What's going on?

22:38.581 --> 22:40.314
Look, Detective, you were
straight with me,

22:40.316 --> 22:42.015
so I'm gonna give you
a heads up.

22:42.017 --> 22:43.650
Okay.
Two days ago

22:43.652 --> 22:45.252
I got pulled out
of my cell at Rikers

22:45.254 --> 22:48.922
by two detectives,
want to interview me about you.

22:48.924 --> 22:50.724
What'd they want to know?

22:50.726 --> 22:53.393
Mostly they wanted to know
how you got a statement out

22:53.395 --> 22:56.497
of me, if you hit me
or violated my rights, or whatever.

22:56.499 --> 22:57.831
So what'd you tell 'em?

22:57.833 --> 23:00.167
I told 'em you asked questions
and I didn't confess.

23:00.169 --> 23:04.004
And I gave you info on a guy
in exchange for a break.

23:04.006 --> 23:06.073
These guys say
what unit they were with?

23:06.075 --> 23:08.742
No.
They have a pin on their lapel?

23:08.744 --> 23:11.578
Nah, they were just suits
with badges and haircuts.

23:11.580 --> 23:14.248
Okay, all right.
Thanks, for your help, Bobby.

23:14.250 --> 23:15.582
Hey,

23:15.584 --> 23:16.750
don't forget I did this.

23:16.752 --> 23:20.087
I don't forget anything.

23:20.089 --> 23:22.089
Son of a bitch.

23:22.091 --> 23:23.290
Sarge?

23:23.292 --> 23:24.825
Everything okay?

23:24.827 --> 23:26.994
No. Who's investigating me
and why?

23:26.996 --> 23:29.229
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:29.231 --> 23:31.131
You're lying to me.
What?

23:31.133 --> 23:33.133
You got a tell, Sarge;
you run your fingers down

23:33.135 --> 23:35.002
your tie whenever
you fib to your wife

23:35.004 --> 23:36.069
and say you're working overtime,

23:36.071 --> 23:37.204
but you're really going out
for beers.

23:37.206 --> 23:39.373
You do it all the time.
You just did it now.

23:39.375 --> 23:40.607
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:40.609 --> 23:43.010
Sarge, who's looking at me?!

23:54.990 --> 23:56.456
Hey.

23:56.458 --> 23:58.091
Where's Grandpa?

23:58.093 --> 24:00.160
He's out.

24:00.162 --> 24:01.528
Good.

24:01.530 --> 24:04.464
Someone's looking into me, Dad.

24:04.466 --> 24:05.966
Who is it?

24:09.170 --> 24:11.772
I really can't talk
about that now.

24:11.774 --> 24:13.240
So you do know about it.

24:15.176 --> 24:18.145
Yes, I do.

24:18.147 --> 24:20.547
You didn't think
to come to me...

24:21.816 --> 24:23.650
...tell me about it?

24:23.652 --> 24:25.252
To what end?

24:25.254 --> 24:27.387
To what end? To any end.
I'm your son.

24:27.389 --> 24:29.489
So what are you asking for?

24:29.491 --> 24:30.891
Seriously.

24:30.893 --> 24:32.726
I run 35,000 cops.

24:32.728 --> 24:34.328
I don't have a VIP list,

24:34.330 --> 24:35.762
nobody gets comped.

24:35.764 --> 24:38.031
Okay, so you're gonna fall back
on that?

24:38.033 --> 24:39.399
No, I'm gonna stand on it.

24:39.401 --> 24:40.434
With you, with anybody.

24:40.436 --> 24:42.402
Why are you looking
into me, Dad?

24:42.404 --> 24:44.671
Can you at least
just tell me that much?

24:44.673 --> 24:46.840
Who said it's me
looking into you?

24:46.842 --> 24:48.542
Well, let's see. It's gotta be
someone with enough juice

24:48.544 --> 24:50.577
to pull one my perps out
and ask him

24:50.579 --> 24:51.912
if I violated his rights.

24:51.914 --> 24:54.648
It's also gotta be someone
with enough juice

24:54.650 --> 24:57.918
to have my case files
sent to One PP for review.

24:57.920 --> 25:00.821
That tells me that
it's one person-- you.

25:00.823 --> 25:02.956
Shoddy work, Detective.

25:02.958 --> 25:04.858
If you or one of your chiefs
thinks I'm not doing

25:04.860 --> 25:07.628
the job the right way,
then just come to me,

25:07.630 --> 25:08.962
the same way you would Jamie

25:08.964 --> 25:10.564
or the same way
you would have Joe.

25:10.566 --> 25:12.666
You do have the right
to remain silent.

25:12.668 --> 25:13.867
You're making jokes?

25:13.869 --> 25:16.937
No, not in the least.
And shut the hell up!

25:16.939 --> 25:19.439
Dad, all I'm asking you is if
someone's got a beef with me,

25:19.441 --> 25:21.041
point 'em out
so I can defend myself!

25:21.043 --> 25:23.176
It doesn't work that way!

25:23.178 --> 25:25.779
Works that way where I'm from.

25:27.415 --> 25:31.652
Look, I'm a grunt.
Always was, always will be,

25:31.654 --> 25:33.520
and nobody's mistaking me
for the next Reagan

25:33.522 --> 25:36.023
being groomed for an office
upstairs. I get it.

25:36.025 --> 25:37.257
You're talking crap.

25:37.259 --> 25:39.793
I'm not talking crap, Dad,
I'm talking the truth.

25:39.795 --> 25:41.628
That's all
you can come back with,

25:41.630 --> 25:42.729
I'm talking crap?

25:42.731 --> 25:45.832
If that's all you think
of yourself,

25:45.834 --> 25:47.200
you're the only one.

25:47.202 --> 25:50.671
Oh, please, spare me the lesson
for once, would ya?

25:54.976 --> 25:58.412
Answer me this, Danny.

25:58.414 --> 26:03.750
Do you really think I would side
against you, ever?

26:10.291 --> 26:12.492
How sad for you.

26:15.363 --> 26:17.531
Now get out of my house.

26:17.533 --> 26:22.335
Come back when you're ready to
have a conversation for real.

26:47.250 --> 26:49.651
What do you got
against salt?

26:49.653 --> 26:52.788
Too many cooks.

26:53.656 --> 26:55.090
Need some help?

26:55.092 --> 26:57.025
No, I think I've got it.

26:57.027 --> 26:58.994
Linda's bringing
her garlic bread.

27:00.965 --> 27:02.698
You look tired, Dad.

27:02.700 --> 27:04.967
I didn't sleep well last night.

27:04.969 --> 27:07.636
I got a surprise visit
from your brother.

27:09.139 --> 27:10.939
He knows.

27:11.775 --> 27:13.876
He thinks he knows.

27:15.578 --> 27:17.279
He thinks it's coming from you.

27:19.249 --> 27:20.516
So I heard.

27:20.518 --> 27:24.486
Uh! This should be a fun dinner.

27:30.860 --> 27:34.396
So, whose turn is it
to say grace? Danny?

27:34.398 --> 27:35.998
Not feeling too thankful
today, Gramps.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.999
Somebody else?

27:37.001 --> 27:38.600
Not here.

27:38.602 --> 27:40.869
Well, I'm just saying.

27:40.871 --> 27:43.872
Wow, am I gonna have to wear
a coat sitting between you two?

27:43.874 --> 27:45.307
What's that supposed to mean?

27:45.309 --> 27:47.342
Chilly.
Leave it alone, Linda.

27:47.344 --> 27:48.710
Just say grace.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.980
Bless us, O Lord,
and these Thy gifts

27:51.982 --> 27:54.583
we are about to receive
through Christ Our Lord. Amen.

27:54.585 --> 27:56.018
Amen.

27:56.020 --> 27:59.455
If I said it that fast,
I would get in trouble.

27:59.457 --> 28:01.757
Your father doesn't worry
about things like that, Jack.

28:02.859 --> 28:06.228
Hey, let's keep it civil.

28:11.836 --> 28:14.236
Linda, could you pass
the garlic bread, please?

28:19.576 --> 28:20.776
Sure.

28:20.778 --> 28:22.778
Thank you.

28:25.381 --> 28:26.315
Jamie,

28:26.317 --> 28:27.749
you look
nice today.

28:27.751 --> 28:29.685
What, you got a date
or something later?

28:29.687 --> 28:32.421
My friend Spencer's in town
buying a company.

28:32.423 --> 28:34.189
We're gonna go out tonight.

28:34.191 --> 28:35.557
Spencer Croft?

28:35.559 --> 28:36.625
Mm-hmm.

28:36.627 --> 28:38.927
I always knew
he would go places.

28:38.929 --> 28:40.629
He did. California.

28:40.631 --> 28:42.064
He was quite the charmer.

28:42.066 --> 28:44.933
Yeah, get in line.

28:44.935 --> 28:47.603
Isn't he that kid that went on
the tuna trip with us one time?

28:47.605 --> 28:49.638
Caught a 120-pounder?

28:49.640 --> 28:51.507
That's a lot of tuna.

28:51.509 --> 28:52.741
Need a lot of mayo.

28:55.979 --> 28:57.112
Nice one, Sean.

29:00.750 --> 29:02.551
Kid made a funny.

29:02.553 --> 29:04.653
I laughed.
Okay.

29:04.655 --> 29:06.555
Let's just get through
the meal, okay?

29:06.557 --> 29:08.123
Hey.

29:08.125 --> 29:09.791
What?

29:09.793 --> 29:11.894
I said not here.

29:21.372 --> 29:22.504
Uncle Danny,

29:22.506 --> 29:24.773
no phones at the dinner table.

29:26.242 --> 29:28.777
Gotta go.

29:28.779 --> 29:30.846
My partner found our suspect.

29:30.848 --> 29:32.781
Really? Can't it wait?

29:32.783 --> 29:34.917
Let him go, Linda.
He's not here anyway.

29:51.034 --> 29:53.468
Corner of the bar.

29:56.739 --> 29:57.839
Milo Finley?

29:57.841 --> 29:58.974
I'm not driving, bro.

29:58.976 --> 30:00.042
It's not "bro,"

30:00.044 --> 30:01.176
it's "detective."
Her, too.

30:01.178 --> 30:03.545
We need to talk to you
about Benjamin Daniels.

30:03.547 --> 30:05.013
Who?

30:05.015 --> 30:06.481
Your old girlfriend's
new old boyfriend.

30:07.918 --> 30:10.352
Bitch can do what she wants.

30:10.354 --> 30:12.988
Mr. Daniels was murdered.
Do you know anything about that?

30:13.856 --> 30:15.657
Really?

30:16.559 --> 30:17.759
Thank you.

30:17.761 --> 30:19.394
You just made my day.

30:19.396 --> 30:21.463
Where were you Wednesday night?

30:21.465 --> 30:25.033
I was right here on my stool.
Right, Keira?

30:25.035 --> 30:26.301
Totally found him asleep

30:26.303 --> 30:28.003
on the toilet around 2:00 a.m.

30:28.005 --> 30:30.739
Posted it. Got a lot of likes.

30:32.208 --> 30:34.209
Look, I got my heart broke.

30:34.211 --> 30:35.877
You never been there?

30:35.879 --> 30:38.747
No, but you're
breaking mine now.

30:44.721 --> 30:45.821
Oh, that aim, Reagan.

30:45.823 --> 30:47.289
It was close.

30:47.291 --> 30:48.957
You're, like, an embarrassment
to the entire PD.

30:48.959 --> 30:50.792
Oh, really? 'Cause we both
know who the better shot is.

30:50.794 --> 30:52.060
Oh, you wish.

30:52.062 --> 30:54.329
All talk.
All talk, this girl.

30:55.632 --> 30:57.299
Oh!

30:57.301 --> 30:58.567
Beat that, Jame-o.

30:58.569 --> 31:01.670
Okay, you know what?
If I get this last shot,

31:01.672 --> 31:04.973
Jame-o is buying drinks
for the rest of the night.

31:04.975 --> 31:06.908
All right, let's see it.

31:06.910 --> 31:08.176
Oh!

31:08.178 --> 31:09.111
Yes!
Yes!

31:09.113 --> 31:10.612
Like, so easy!

31:12.015 --> 31:13.849
That's how you do it.
You see that?

31:13.851 --> 31:17.586
Um, so, my friend,
I would like

31:17.588 --> 31:19.888
a margarita on the rocks
with salt, please.

31:19.890 --> 31:21.023
Sure ya wanna mix

31:21.025 --> 31:22.157
like that, ya lush?

31:22.159 --> 31:24.393
Oh, I can handle my liquor,
thank you very much.

31:24.395 --> 31:25.994
And get one
for Hayley, too.

31:25.996 --> 31:28.630
Eddie, do you want to come
with me to the girls' room?

31:28.632 --> 31:30.198
I need you a sec.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.134
Why do girls always need
to pee in pairs.

31:32.136 --> 31:33.902
We do not, okay?

31:33.904 --> 31:35.971
Okay, try not to miss us
too much.

31:35.973 --> 31:37.339
Okay, we'll try.

31:39.109 --> 31:41.610
You realize you're kidding
yourself, right?

31:41.612 --> 31:43.345
What do you mean?

31:43.347 --> 31:44.780
You said you were
not into Eddie.

31:44.782 --> 31:46.348
She's like my sister.

31:46.350 --> 31:48.383
Well, I think you want
to kiss your sister.

31:48.385 --> 31:50.619
And I don't mean Erin.

31:50.621 --> 31:52.354
I don't. Come on. Man, I...

31:52.356 --> 31:54.189
I can't even go there.
Well, I'm not

31:54.191 --> 31:56.024
going there either,
'cause if I went for it,

31:56.026 --> 31:57.693
it'd be in strict violation
of bro code.

31:57.695 --> 31:59.928
Ah, so, what, you want to leave?

31:59.930 --> 32:02.364
Of course not. I plan to kill
you in beer pong

32:02.366 --> 32:03.565
at least three more times

32:03.567 --> 32:05.367
before the night
is through.

32:05.369 --> 32:07.936
I'm gonna get those drinks.

32:07.938 --> 32:10.338
All right.

32:13.476 --> 32:16.812
<i>I was on the desk</i>
<i>from 8:00 that night.</i>

32:16.814 --> 32:18.178
And you only saw
Mrs. Daniels once?

32:18.203 --> 32:19.315
That's it? You sure?

32:19.316 --> 32:21.650
Yeah. Like I said, Mrs. Daniels
comes home like, 9:00,

32:21.652 --> 32:23.251
and I didn't see
her after that.

32:23.253 --> 32:25.954
All right. This door here,
it's the only other exit in the building?

32:25.956 --> 32:27.656
Yeah.
It's always armed?

32:27.658 --> 32:29.458
Far as I know.
All right.

32:29.460 --> 32:30.625
Can we open it up?

32:30.627 --> 32:31.793
You're the police, man.

32:33.797 --> 32:35.997
See? It works.
Yeah.

32:35.999 --> 32:37.532
Can you turn it off?

32:38.601 --> 32:40.769
Can anybody come down here
and open this door?

32:40.771 --> 32:43.371
Anybody who knew
where the key was at.

32:43.373 --> 32:45.040
The key's hanging
right there.

32:45.042 --> 32:47.909
It protects from people coming
from the outside, not from in.

32:47.911 --> 32:51.813
Oh. So it's possible, then,
that somebody could come downstairs

32:51.815 --> 32:53.348
and maybe drop off
their laundry,

32:53.350 --> 32:55.984
grab the key, disarm the door,
go out for a while,

32:55.986 --> 32:58.787
come back, rearm the door,
grab their laundry,

32:58.789 --> 33:00.455
go upstairs like nothing
ever happened?

33:00.457 --> 33:02.390
I guess. Don't know why
they'd want to.

33:02.392 --> 33:04.292
Huh.
Thank you.

33:04.294 --> 33:07.462
Guess we should take a
closer look at Mrs. Daniels.

33:07.464 --> 33:10.232
I guess you're right.

33:11.535 --> 33:13.468
You are so wrong
about the lyrics.

33:13.470 --> 33:15.871
No, I've heard that song
a bajillion times.

33:15.873 --> 33:17.672
My mom loves that song.

33:17.674 --> 33:18.907
It's "crystal ball."

33:18.909 --> 33:20.575
I know what I'm
talking about.

33:20.577 --> 33:22.277
Yeah, well,
my mom loved it, too.

33:22.279 --> 33:24.980
Her and my dad used
to put it on and get tipsy.

33:24.982 --> 33:26.515
And dance.

33:26.517 --> 33:28.316
And my sister and I would
sneak down and watch.

33:28.318 --> 33:31.052
And the lyric's...
♪ Or anyone at all.

33:31.054 --> 33:33.255
That's... that makes sense.
What?

33:34.858 --> 33:36.858
No, it doesn't.

33:36.860 --> 33:39.261
It's "You don't need
a fortune-teller

33:39.263 --> 33:42.330
"with a crystal ball
to tell us

33:42.332 --> 33:45.233
in the autumn that the
leaves are gonna fall."

33:45.235 --> 33:47.335
♪ Or if the evening sun

33:47.337 --> 33:49.838
♪ Will slip into the sea

33:49.840 --> 33:51.206

33:51.208 --> 33:53.208

33:53.210 --> 33:54.509

33:58.381 --> 34:00.715
Oh, th-this is me.

34:00.717 --> 34:04.452
Yeah, sure is.

34:28.311 --> 34:30.911
You should get inside,
it's late.

34:30.914 --> 34:33.047
Oh, okay.

34:34.351 --> 34:36.284
We've got a day tour tomorrow.

34:36.286 --> 34:37.886
Right.

34:37.888 --> 34:39.286
Bright and early.

34:42.558 --> 34:44.125
Okay, I'll see you later.

34:44.127 --> 34:46.328
Yup.

35:05.232 --> 35:07.233
Where are we
with the Daniels murder?

35:07.235 --> 35:10.703
Well, husband was having
an affair with a college girl,

35:10.705 --> 35:12.738
so we like the wife, but...

35:12.740 --> 35:13.773
But there's certainly
no probable cause

35:13.775 --> 35:15.108
to make the arrest.

35:15.110 --> 35:16.642
What do you got so far?

35:16.644 --> 35:18.544
Well, finances indicate
the husband was spending down

35:18.546 --> 35:20.813
their retirement to put
the girl through school.

35:20.815 --> 35:22.748
And then there's
these gooey love poems

35:22.750 --> 35:24.784
that he was sending
to the college girl.

35:24.786 --> 35:28.254
"In the gallery between
wakefulness and slumber,

35:28.256 --> 35:29.755
"hangs a radiant canvas

35:29.757 --> 35:31.224
"rendered,

35:31.226 --> 35:33.893
"surely by a haloed master.

35:33.895 --> 35:36.129
Mmm.
"This is your forever face.

35:36.131 --> 35:37.930
"And I am the sole docent

35:37.932 --> 35:41.134
"in this epha...
mm... eph...

35:41.136 --> 35:43.002
"Ephemeral."
"...ephemeral

35:43.004 --> 35:44.570
museum." Wow.

35:44.572 --> 35:46.005
You had me feeling
all warm and fuzzy there

35:46.007 --> 35:47.173
for a sec, Sarge.

35:47.175 --> 35:48.241
Don't get carried
away, hmm.

35:48.243 --> 35:49.342
Let me see one of these.

35:49.344 --> 35:50.977
All I have is lingerie receipts.

35:50.979 --> 35:52.245
"On the N train

35:52.247 --> 35:54.947
"coursing through the veins
of Ersatz Athens

35:54.949 --> 35:57.083
"pumped by a hungry heart,

35:57.085 --> 35:59.385
"we soon feast on
Moussaka and Tsatsiki

35:59.387 --> 36:02.755
"And I toast
you Artemis with Retsina.

36:02.757 --> 36:05.491
A trip to Olympus for the price
of a subway token."

36:05.493 --> 36:07.426
Is this a poem about
them taking the N train

36:07.428 --> 36:08.794
to Astoria for Greek food?

36:08.796 --> 36:10.263
Maybe it is.

36:10.265 --> 36:11.364
Read that part again?

36:11.366 --> 36:12.865
The-the end, about Olympus.

36:12.867 --> 36:15.134
"A trip to Olympus for the price
of a subway token."

36:15.136 --> 36:16.736
Subway token.

36:16.738 --> 36:19.605
When's the last time
anybody used a subway token?

36:19.607 --> 36:21.507
MetroCard came out in
the early '90s, I think.

36:21.509 --> 36:22.742
Right.

36:22.744 --> 36:24.677
Maggie wasn't even born yet.
Exactly.

36:24.679 --> 36:26.445
I think this guy was recycling.

36:26.447 --> 36:27.613
Tokens?

36:27.615 --> 36:28.581
No, the,

36:28.583 --> 36:30.016
the poems.

36:30.018 --> 36:31.817
Imagine you're the wife
and you find out

36:31.819 --> 36:33.586
he's having an affair
with a 20-yea-old college girl.

36:33.588 --> 36:34.554
That's bad enough.

36:34.556 --> 36:37.123
But now add in the fact
that he's

36:37.125 --> 36:38.858
sending her poems
that he wrote for you

36:38.860 --> 36:40.726
when you were falling
in love with him?!

36:40.728 --> 36:43.329
That would really send me
over the edge.

36:54.408 --> 36:56.742
You look awful.

36:56.744 --> 36:58.678
Hopefully this hangover

36:58.680 --> 37:00.513
egg and cheese sammy
will do the trick.

37:00.515 --> 37:03.416
I'm not sure how you look
so together after last night.

37:03.418 --> 37:06.652
I have the metabolism of a
D-1 football-playing frat boy.

37:06.654 --> 37:08.087
Lucky you.

37:08.089 --> 37:09.755
Hopefully the radio'll
be quiet today.

37:09.757 --> 37:12.725
Yeah, fingers crossed.

37:12.727 --> 37:16.295
What is taking
so long with our order?

37:21.335 --> 37:22.702
So, about last night...

37:22.704 --> 37:24.203
I shouldn't have done that.

37:24.205 --> 37:25.705
I have a knack

37:25.707 --> 37:27.473
for going after
the wrong kind of guys.

37:27.475 --> 37:30.009
Either they're off-limits
or just plain off.

37:30.011 --> 37:31.811
When you work together
long enough,

37:31.813 --> 37:33.412
either you hate each other or...

37:33.414 --> 37:35.314
Or make out on the sidewalk?

37:37.451 --> 37:39.151
It was a crazy night.
Hey.

37:39.153 --> 37:40.853
It was gonna happen
sooner or later.

37:40.855 --> 37:42.121
At least now it's
out of our systems.

37:42.123 --> 37:44.590
We'll laugh about this
for a long time.

37:52.666 --> 37:54.500
How is the investigation going?

37:54.502 --> 37:56.702
It's going well, uh,
we may be onto something,

37:56.704 --> 37:59.538
Mrs. Daniels, but we could
really use your help.

37:59.540 --> 38:02.008
Please, sit down.

38:02.010 --> 38:05.244
Mrs. Daniels,
we have reason to believe

38:05.246 --> 38:06.846
that one of your husband's

38:06.848 --> 38:08.914
students may have been
involved in this murder.

38:08.916 --> 38:11.183
But his students loved him.

38:11.185 --> 38:14.920
Yeah, well, that may actually
have been the problem.

38:14.922 --> 38:16.589
I'm sorry?

38:16.591 --> 38:18.591
Do you recognize this girl?

38:21.495 --> 38:23.162
Well, we work
in different departments,

38:23.164 --> 38:25.498
so there's not a lot
of student crossovers.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.066
That's not what I asked you.

38:27.068 --> 38:29.835
Do you recognize this girl,
yes or no?

38:29.837 --> 38:31.971
Oh...

38:31.973 --> 38:34.073
Mrs. Daniels, I understand

38:34.075 --> 38:36.409
this is
a difficult time for you.

38:36.411 --> 38:38.144
But we strongly suspect
that your husband

38:38.146 --> 38:39.278
was having an affair

38:39.280 --> 38:40.746
with this women,
his student.

38:42.215 --> 38:44.750
Uh, look, I-I...
I've already told you.

38:44.752 --> 38:46.719
That is not in his character.

38:46.721 --> 38:50.056
Well, people can
surprise you sometimes.

38:51.325 --> 38:53.225
In fact, we were thinking
maybe you should

38:53.227 --> 38:54.660
take a look
at some of these poems

38:54.662 --> 38:56.729
he wrote for her.

38:58.765 --> 39:00.866
Excuse me, what are you doing?

39:00.868 --> 39:02.935
Here, why don't you
start with this one?

39:02.937 --> 39:04.570
Or this one.

39:04.572 --> 39:05.638
How about that?

39:05.640 --> 39:08.507
That one, any of these.

39:08.509 --> 39:09.942
Tell you what, Mrs. Daniels.

39:09.944 --> 39:11.777
How about I just
read one for you?

39:11.779 --> 39:14.647
Please, just stop this!

39:14.649 --> 39:16.182
"Your cheek the apple shames,

39:16.184 --> 39:17.917
"And the brightest star turns

39:17.919 --> 39:19.452
"ignominious shooter,

39:19.454 --> 39:21.987
mortified by the wink
of your eye."

39:24.024 --> 39:25.257
He wrote this for you,
didn't he?

39:25.259 --> 39:26.525
What?

39:26.527 --> 39:28.160
Yeah, he did.

39:28.162 --> 39:29.495
He wrote them for you,

39:29.497 --> 39:31.197
and then he made a mockery
of your marriage

39:31.199 --> 39:33.432
by stealing them from you

39:33.434 --> 39:35.401
and giving them to her,
this woman.

39:35.403 --> 39:37.536
His new girlfriend.

39:37.538 --> 39:38.838
His new lover.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.306
Your replacement!

39:40.308 --> 39:43.342
I could never let that happen!

40:00.427 --> 40:01.927
Hi, Dad.

40:01.929 --> 40:03.896
I forgot to ask
if it was dinner,

40:03.898 --> 40:05.898
but I was hungry
so I brought some.

40:05.900 --> 40:08.834
Perfect.

40:08.836 --> 40:11.404
So, I wanted to tell you
that I talked to Danny,

40:11.406 --> 40:12.872
and I told him
that the investigation

40:12.874 --> 40:15.574
was preliminary
and that it was

40:15.576 --> 40:18.811
initiated by the DA's office.

40:18.813 --> 40:20.179
When?

40:20.181 --> 40:21.981
Today.

40:23.950 --> 40:26.419
I never heard from him.

40:26.421 --> 40:28.554
Did you call him?

40:52.779 --> 40:55.214
I thought we should
all have a drink.

40:55.216 --> 40:58.517
Scotch or scotch?

41:11.331 --> 41:12.565
Why didn't you just say?

41:12.567 --> 41:14.133
"Say"?

41:14.135 --> 41:15.768
Say that it was
the DA's office.

41:15.770 --> 41:18.504
Because I do not have license
to interfere in their business.

41:18.506 --> 41:20.172
You should've said something.

41:20.174 --> 41:21.841
I should have, huh?
Yeah.

41:21.843 --> 41:22.908
Well, I disagree.

41:22.910 --> 41:26.445
I don't take orders
from you.

41:30.917 --> 41:33.018
Here.

41:33.020 --> 41:34.253
What's that?

41:36.756 --> 41:39.959
Something I wrote.

41:40.961 --> 41:42.394
Wh-What is it?

41:42.396 --> 41:44.597
Just take a look.

41:44.599 --> 41:46.832
"Addendum to the
interrogation guidelines

41:46.834 --> 41:48.534
for the detective bureau."

41:48.536 --> 41:51.470
It is a draft that
recommends techniques

41:51.472 --> 41:53.305
developed and implemented

41:53.307 --> 41:56.242
by some of my most
productive detectives.

41:56.244 --> 41:58.978
Is that right?

41:58.980 --> 42:00.813
Also flags some techniques

42:00.815 --> 42:03.148
that will no longer
be acceptable.

42:03.150 --> 42:05.117
Right.

42:05.119 --> 42:08.220
Let me guess
which section I'm in.

42:08.222 --> 42:12.258
Actually, you'll find yourself
in both sections.

42:14.160 --> 42:16.362
Here you go, Dad.

42:19.266 --> 42:21.901
Pizza will be warm in a minute.

42:21.903 --> 42:25.237
Thanks.

42:27.608 --> 42:29.608
What, are we
gonna watch TV?

42:29.610 --> 42:30.943
Yup.

42:30.945 --> 42:32.578
Something special
coming on?

42:32.580 --> 42:35.180
Yeah, I finally had
all our home movies

42:35.182 --> 42:36.715
transferred to digital.

42:36.717 --> 42:40.419
Welcome to the world premiere.

42:44.324 --> 42:45.824
Montauk?

42:45.826 --> 42:46.959
Yup.

42:46.961 --> 42:48.827
What year?

42:48.829 --> 42:52.765
Judging from my bathing suit,
I'd say early '80s.

42:52.767 --> 42:54.099
♪ What a wonderful world

42:54.101 --> 42:55.568
And judging from Mom's

42:55.570 --> 42:57.503
bathing suit,
I'd say early '50s.

42:57.505 --> 42:58.671
Hey.

42:58.673 --> 43:01.040
She's my mother.

43:01.042 --> 43:02.775
I'm allowed.

43:02.777 --> 43:05.678
♪ I see skies of blue

43:05.680 --> 43:09.615
♪ And clouds of white

43:09.617 --> 43:12.585
♪ The bright blessed day

43:12.587 --> 43:16.155
♪ And the dark sacred night

43:16.157 --> 43:22.027
♪ And I think to myself

43:22.029 --> 43:23.896
♪ What a wonderful world...
