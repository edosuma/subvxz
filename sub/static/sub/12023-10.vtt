head back south, you know?

be ahead of Jack in the load count.

sometimes, you know?

they don't have anything for me.

sitting out here in this yard.

here goin' back to Fairbanks.

Hey, Darrell.

03:08.452 --> 03:10.352
Well, how the fuck
did you get a load?

03:10.354 --> 03:14.456
I called from Coldfoot, and pulled
a little seniority on that one.

up, isn't it?

'em any time you want.

way around here, sometimes.

could teach you a couple.

they ought to be given to

the fucking load.

out from underneath me is bullshit.

05:22.620 --> 05:25.854
That's a heavy haul,
that's for sure.

05:25.856 --> 05:28.657
You know, I've hauled all these
heavy haul loads up there, and--

05:28.659 --> 05:31.327
Well, I've shown 'em, and I've
proved to myself that I'm not

05:31.329 --> 05:33.862
just some punk kid, that
I know what I'm doing.

05:33.864 --> 05:38.167

myself, by, you know, hauling

the biggest loads, showing these

what it takes to be here.

haulin' if they didn't think I

05:58.356 --> 05:59.688
knew what I was doing.

05:59.690 --> 06:03.125
Let's put the landing gear up.

06:12.602 --> 06:14.236

the landing gear frozen in place.

to do-- Fuck.

out on his own... - I don't know.

06:38.195 --> 06:42.664
Narrator: Or his heavy haul will be
over before he's out of the yard.

06:42.666 --> 06:46.035
Just gonna rig something up,
so they don't come down.

06:46.037 --> 06:52.107
I'm tired of fucking with these
landing gears all the freaking time.

07:00.617 --> 07:02.818
What I had to do is take a
chain and wrap it around the

07:02.820 --> 07:07.056
landing gear and then tie 'em up to
the trailers so they won't fall down.

07:07.058 --> 07:10.459
Narrator: He's got the load ready
to go, but now he's gotta

07:10.461 --> 07:16.331
get the 30-ton plow up the icy
inclines of the Dalton... alone.

07:16.333 --> 07:24.273

that's the way I've always been.

east at the Cantung mine.

It's kinda like
getting into a tank.

07:36.687 --> 07:39.788
valuable loads of his career.

looking for gold.

07:45.930 --> 07:47.296
I'm interested in
other minerals, too.

07:47.298 --> 07:51.800
So here you get a chance to go
into an operating mine and see

07:51.802 --> 07:53.102
how they do their work.

07:53.104 --> 07:56.405
Narrator: Each year, the mine
produces over 6 million pounds

07:56.407 --> 07:59.641
- of tungsten...
- So what's in here, now?

07:59.643 --> 08:04.079
Narrator: Which is used in everything
from light bulbs to X-ray machines.

08:04.081 --> 08:06.448
This is called a refuge station.

08:06.450 --> 08:08.183
You got water, you
got fresh air.

08:08.185 --> 08:10.652
So when they had all those
miners trapped underground in

08:10.654 --> 08:12.821
South America, that's what-- This
is what they were in?

08:12.823 --> 08:14.056
Something similar.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.558
Do they got any games, or anything
in here, to entertain 'em?

08:16.560 --> 08:18.193
Uh, just jokes.

08:18.195 --> 08:19.428

hauling a day's worth of

08:27.505 --> 08:32.274
tungsten ore out of the mine.

08:32.275 --> 08:34.009
So you're gonna be
at maximum weight.

08:34.010 --> 08:35.344
There's 11 bags.

08:35.346 --> 08:36.445
It's pretty valuable.

08:36.447 --> 08:38.714
It's a million-dollar
load, so no pressure.

- I think I've got a problem, here.

08:57.635 --> 09:00.469
Narrator: The one-lane mine
road's steep grades and sheer

09:00.471 --> 09:03.972
cliffs almost took
out the veteran.

09:03.974 --> 09:05.707

09:05.709 --> 09:08.544
Narrator: And now he's gotta head
back down the mountain with

a million-dollar
load on the line.

09:11.348 --> 09:13.515
It's a pretty special load,
'cause they've told me it's

so I better look after it.

at the edge of Lake Winnipeg...

09:34.705 --> 09:38.707

Pauingassi today, three loads of cement.

09:38.709 --> 09:39.975
Rick's still sick.

09:40.043 --> 09:43.412

get a profit on the books.

09:43.414 --> 09:45.981

made the winter roads nearly undriveable.

09:50.387 --> 09:54.456
We're just goin' in to
the fucking water, here.

09:54.458 --> 09:58.327
Narrator: And a respiratory infection
has Rick on the sick list.

09:58.329 --> 10:00.395
Why the fuck did that
have to happen to me?

10:00.397 --> 10:03.498
Why can't it be fucking
Hugh-ey down here?

10:03.500 --> 10:08.770
Narrator: And it's forced Hugh to make
a Hail Mary play to save his season.

10:08.772 --> 10:11.940
So I wrangled Vlad
into it, here.

10:11.942 --> 10:14.610
So I got another guy, and he's
never even been on the fucking

10:14.612 --> 10:16.044
ice before.

10:16.046 --> 10:18.213

10:18.215 --> 10:23.719
Narrator: He's put together a convoy
with dispatcher Vlad Pleskot...

10:23.721 --> 10:26.955
and the shop mechanic, who's
never driven on the ice.

10:27.056 --> 10:29.758

10:29.760 --> 10:33.996
Never driven across ice,
never drilled holes in ice.

10:34.063 --> 10:39.401
I've never done nothing on ice,
except put it in my drink.

10:41.771 --> 10:45.540
Wish me luck.

10:45.542 --> 10:47.442
Okay, we rarin' boys?

10:47.444 --> 10:49.611
Up and at 'er.

10:49.613 --> 10:51.246
Yeah, I guess now or never.

10:51.248 --> 10:52.447
I'm gonna go on right now.

10:52.449 --> 10:54.416
Vlad will come down, and then
I'll tell him when it's safe,

10:54.418 --> 10:56.518
and then, uh, he'll tell
you when it's safe.

10:56.520 --> 10:57.252
Get 'er done.

10:57.254 --> 10:58.153
Let's rock and roll.

10:58.155 --> 11:01.089
Don't nobody go swimming.

11:01.091 --> 11:04.426
[Clears throat] Swimming.

11:07.063 --> 11:09.765
Narrator: It's up to Hugh to
get this ragtag team over

11:09.767 --> 11:17.239
the crossing and see that no one ends
up at the bottom of the frozen lake.

11:25.181 --> 11:28.483
It's cracking pretty good
today, you can hear it.

11:28.485 --> 11:31.687

11:34.857 --> 11:37.492
Okay, you can probably
head out there, Wilson.

11:37.593 --> 11:39.861
Thank you.

11:49.439 --> 11:50.472
Hey, buddy, help.

11:50.474 --> 11:53.141
I'm going through,
I'm going through!

11:53.209 --> 11:56.878
[Laughs]

12:01.584 --> 12:03.285
I think you should
be okay to go.

12:03.353 --> 12:05.020
Just give 'er a try.

12:05.022 --> 12:07.689
[Laughs] Give her a try?

12:07.790 --> 12:12.327
Yeah. You'll see what happens.

12:12.428 --> 12:15.297
They're gonna be cracking and
popping the ice, and I get to be

12:15.299 --> 12:19.835
the-- the tail end of it all.

12:19.837 --> 12:24.673
Oh, this is crazy, this is
crazy, this is crazy, man.

[Whistles]

12:25.843 --> 12:27.376
Oh, man.

12:27.378 --> 12:32.414
Narrator: The first-timer creeps
forward with over 30,000

12:32.416 --> 12:37.953
pounds of cement and the weight
of the season on his shoulders.

12:37.955 --> 12:42.457
I'm on the water.

12:42.459 --> 12:45.627
[Clears throat] I have some low
gear on the water, coming on, is

12:45.629 --> 12:47.028
good, right?

12:47.030 --> 12:54.403
When you go on just go as slow as
you can, and then pick her up.

12:58.608 --> 13:00.909
Oh, it's cracking.

13:00.911 --> 13:07.649
Ughh... I'm driving onto the ice
here, and I can hear it cracking already.

13:07.651 --> 13:13.121
Oh, my God, it's cracking!

13:13.222 --> 13:15.190
Holy crap.

13:15.192 --> 13:19.561
Ahhhh!

13:19.563 --> 13:21.930
I hear it poppin', I
hear the ice poppin'.

13:21.932 --> 13:24.266
[Ice cracking]

13:24.268 --> 13:30.172
Big-fucking cracks there, man.

13:30.174 --> 13:37.379
It's looking pretty
wild right now, man.

13:37.381 --> 13:40.015
Mechanic Derek there,
he's pretty nervous.

13:40.017 --> 13:41.917
Either he'll do it, or he won't.

13:41.919 --> 13:45.754
Wow.

13:50.126 --> 13:52.327
Okay, there's a big truck
comin' at us, so make sure

13:52.329 --> 13:56.264
you slow down when you
get close to 'im.

13:56.266 --> 13:58.333
When you meet a truck crossing
on the ice, you gotta

13:58.335 --> 14:03.972
slow right down, 'cause the two
waves come together, and, uh,

14:03.974 --> 14:08.910
you don't want that.

14:13.516 --> 14:20.021
I gotta slow down, 'cause the wave
underneath my ice is meeting his wave.

14:20.023 --> 14:25.994
So we cannot bump up the
ice in front of us.

14:25.996 --> 14:28.563
There's a big truck
coming at me.

14:28.565 --> 14:32.667
I'm going to slow right
down, to... about 5 K.

14:32.669 --> 14:33.902
I better double-check.

14:33.904 --> 14:36.171
Are you doin' about 5 K when
you're passing the truck?

14:36.173 --> 14:38.106
Yeah, and just remember, Derek,
whatever you do, don't

14:38.108 --> 14:41.543
stop, because it's not
rated for stop weight.

14:41.545 --> 14:46.281
No stopping on the
ice, 10-4, 10-4.

14:52.388 --> 14:55.624
Holy crap.

14:55.626 --> 15:00.662
Narrator: - Coming up...
- I missed the shift.

15:00.664 --> 15:02.631
Narrator: - And later...
- That's ridiculous!

15:02.633 --> 15:04.099
Narrator: Haul road rage.

15:04.101 --> 15:05.634
[Honking]

15:05.636 --> 15:06.568
Get out the way!

15:06.570 --> 15:08.370
[Honking]

15:12.123 --> 15:17.360
Narrator: - In Manitoba, Canada...
- Okay, there's a big truck

15:17.362 --> 15:18.261
comin' at it.

15:18.263 --> 15:20.497
Aw, jeez, man.

15:20.564 --> 15:23.399
Narrator: Desperate to make some
cash, Hugh's leading a Hail

15:23.401 --> 15:30.774
- Mary convoy across the ice with
dispatcher Vlad... - I gotta slow down.

15:30.776 --> 15:32.542
Oh, my God, it's cracking.

15:32.544 --> 15:37.147
Narrator: And the shop mechanic, who's
driving on ice for the first time.

15:37.248 --> 15:39.415
Just remember, Derek,
whatever you do, don't stop,

15:39.417 --> 15:41.518
because it's not rated
for stop weight.

15:41.619 --> 15:46.890
No stopping on the
ice, 10-4, 10-4.

15:48.592 --> 15:52.328
[Groans] Ahh.

15:57.701 --> 16:01.171
Holy crap.

16:03.107 --> 16:04.774
Sweet!

16:04.776 --> 16:06.409
Passed the truck?

16:06.411 --> 16:09.412
[Laughs]

16:09.414 --> 16:11.247
I'm glad I'm rolling
with the Polar Bear.

16:11.249 --> 16:16.686
If anybody's gonna teach
me, it's gonna be him.

16:16.688 --> 16:19.422
Okay, I'm the first one off
the ice, and I made her.

16:19.490 --> 16:23.693
Hope you guys make her.

16:23.695 --> 16:26.329
And we are on the ground.

16:31.702 --> 16:35.004
I've heard stories of people
going through, but, uh, holy

16:35.006 --> 16:38.708
crap, this is cracking, man.

16:38.710 --> 16:43.513
Oh, jeez.

16:50.387 --> 16:53.156
I made 'er.

16:53.158 --> 16:56.593
If my old man saw me
now, he'd be proud.

16:56.595 --> 16:58.494
[Honks]

16:58.496 --> 17:01.231
Narrator: Hugh gets his
team across the lake...

17:01.233 --> 17:04.300
Well, you popped your cherry, and,
uh, you're, uh-- Welcome to

17:04.301 --> 17:06.869
the ice road truckers.

17:06.872 --> 17:11.574
Narrator: And the mechanic
survives his first ice crossing.

17:11.576 --> 17:15.612
Officially an ice
road trucker now.

17:15.614 --> 17:20.583
Narrator: - 1,800 miles to the northwest...
- We got a hot load of freight

17:20.585 --> 17:23.486
on this truck, getting
there as quick as we can.

17:23.488 --> 17:24.387
Narrator: Ronald "Porkchop"

17:24.388 --> 17:28.558
Mangum is racing up the road to
get his season back on track.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.393
[Honks]

17:30.395 --> 17:33.296
By God, I'm gonna win
this load count.

17:33.298 --> 17:37.667
Damn it, I'm gonna show 'em just
how big a boy I am, by God.

17:37.669 --> 17:41.571
Narrator: - Two days ago...
- Prudhoe Bay, get the hell

17:41.573 --> 17:44.007
out the way, here
comes the Chop.

17:44.009 --> 17:48.077
Narrator: He was unleashed on his
first solo run up the Dalton.

17:48.079 --> 17:48.845
First trip to frickin'

17:48.847 --> 17:51.347
Prudhoe, by myself, baby!

17:51.349 --> 17:54.250
Narrator: And only two loads off
the lead, he's making good

17:54.252 --> 17:57.921
time with a light load of
construction supplies.

17:57.923 --> 18:00.556
We only have about a 10,000
pound load on here right now.

18:00.624 --> 18:04.093
It's so light, I'm gonna have to
end up juicing up my speed a

18:04.095 --> 18:07.830
little bit to get up these
hills, get my momentum going.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.638
Looks like we got a
truck coming up here.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.006
Slow, old fuel trucks.

18:17.008 --> 18:21.544
I wish they would
get out my way.

18:25.082 --> 18:26.749
Get over.

18:26.751 --> 18:28.351
He needs to get out the way,
before I lose momentum.

18:28.353 --> 18:29.519
This is ridiculous.

18:29.521 --> 18:34.490
Narrator: Without enough momentum to
carry him up Koyukuk's steep grade,

18:34.492 --> 18:38.261
Porkchop's light load
could easily spin out.

18:38.263 --> 18:40.797
Ten miles an hour up the hill,
and as heavy as he is, and

18:40.799 --> 18:44.000
as light I am, I've got to keep
my speed up on these hills.

18:44.002 --> 18:45.635
This is ridiculous.

18:45.637 --> 18:49.372
He's got plenty of pulling weight,
he should've let me come by.

18:49.374 --> 18:55.278
If I lose traction on
this, I'm screwed.

18:58.782 --> 19:01.351
Damn it, boy, we're spinning.

19:01.353 --> 19:04.087
I'm spinning like hell.

19:04.089 --> 19:08.191
[Indistinct]

19:08.193 --> 19:09.425
This is ridiculous.

19:09.427 --> 19:13.563
I'm spinning out, can't keep my
damn traction, I'm so light.

19:22.339 --> 19:24.374
[Honking]

19:24.376 --> 19:26.075
Get out the way!

19:26.077 --> 19:28.277
Move, move! Damn!

19:28.279 --> 19:35.785
[Honking]

19:42.026 --> 19:46.729
Thank God.

19:46.731 --> 19:53.369
[Honking]

19:53.371 --> 19:56.272
It's fricking ridiculous.

19:56.274 --> 19:58.941
Narrator: The aggressive move
gets the tanker out of the

19:58.943 --> 20:01.911
way and the load up the Koyukuk.

20:01.913 --> 20:04.380
It's supposed to be a hot load
of freight, but it will get

20:04.382 --> 20:07.550
there when I get it there.

20:07.552 --> 20:11.921
Narrator: While Porkchop
charges north, another Dalton

20:11.923 --> 20:15.625
newcomer's on his way south.

20:15.627 --> 20:19.462
If you gotta cheat to win,
you're not the ace.

20:19.464 --> 20:23.166
Narrator: Darrell Ward's driven
250 miles without a load,

20:23.168 --> 20:26.436
after losing out on a back
haul to rival Jack Jessee.

20:26.503 --> 20:28.037
I'm going up against
the haul road ace.

20:28.039 --> 20:34.410
I'm-- I'm chasing him for load count,
that's what this is all about.

20:38.082 --> 20:38.915
Hey, there.

20:38.917 --> 20:39.682
Are you Darrell?

20:39.684 --> 20:40.550
Yep.

20:40.552 --> 20:42.185
I have a paper for you.

20:42.187 --> 20:44.987
There you go.

20:47.257 --> 20:48.624
"Had an emergency back home.

20:48.626 --> 20:50.793
Had to return to Fairbanks.

20:50.795 --> 20:52.895
Please run this load
to Prudhoe for me.

20:52.897 --> 20:54.630
Thanks, Zeke."

20:54.632 --> 20:56.432
Right on. Huh.

20:56.434 --> 20:57.633
I ain't eatin' breakfast.

20:57.635 --> 21:01.904
I'm gonna-- get outta here.

21:01.906 --> 21:04.273
I got a fucking
load, that's cool.

21:04.275 --> 21:07.810
That'll fucking do it.

21:07.812 --> 21:12.081
Sucks to be you, Jack, play
your fucking games on me.

21:12.083 --> 21:15.885
Narrator: After a stroke of luck,
Darrell's heading back to

21:15.887 --> 21:20.523
Prudhoe Bay with a load of drill pipe
that'll keep him tied with Jack.

21:20.525 --> 21:26.529
I am going to hook up to this load
and get the fuck outta here.

21:26.531 --> 21:30.700
Pulls his bullshit on me, you know,
that's fucking karma for ya.

21:30.702 --> 21:33.536
It's got me an extra
load, is what it did.

21:33.538 --> 21:35.671
Nice.

21:35.673 --> 21:40.710
Right on, man, fucking awesome.

21:40.712 --> 21:44.447
He might be Jack Jessee, he might
be the ace of the haul road.

21:44.449 --> 21:46.516
But I know what I can do.

21:46.518 --> 21:49.519
I'll take him down.

21:51.889 --> 21:53.723
[Honking]

21:53.725 --> 21:57.059
Looks like Jack made it
here with my load. Huh.

21:57.061 --> 22:03.065
Maybe I oughta have a nice
little word with him?

22:03.067 --> 22:05.601
See-- see what happens
when you take my load?

22:05.603 --> 22:06.536
Yeah.

22:06.538 --> 22:08.538
That's all right.

22:08.639 --> 22:10.439
I got my own load.

22:10.441 --> 22:11.807
I'm headed down the road.

22:11.809 --> 22:14.243
You got one, I got one
waitin' when I get back.

22:14.311 --> 22:16.512
Well, I hope I got one
waitin' up there.

22:16.514 --> 22:19.315
I'll meet you on the road
somewhere, unless you're calling

22:19.317 --> 22:22.318
them, telling them not to
give me one, you know?

22:22.320 --> 22:26.556
- If that's how you stay on top of the
load count, you know, that, uh-- - No.

22:26.558 --> 22:29.492
You know, don't-- don't cut my
throat to keep your nickname.

22:29.494 --> 22:31.727
It's all about freight, man.

22:31.729 --> 22:34.797
Narrator: Neck and neck in the
dash for the cash, Darrell

22:34.799 --> 22:45.241
hits the road for Prudhoe Bay while
Jack makes a break for Fairbanks.

22:45.243 --> 22:49.679
It's all good for my load count
and my paycheck, you know.

22:49.681 --> 22:52.782
Well, the new guys are
complaining they don't get the

22:52.784 --> 22:57.486
loads that I get, as many
runs as I get, you know.

22:57.488 --> 23:04.594
But it's one of the benefits of
being a senior driver out here.

23:06.363 --> 23:16.205
Narrator: - 450 miles to the east...
- Tractor trailer, southbound into the pass.

23:16.273 --> 23:19.275
Narrator: Alex Debogorski's
hauling a million-dollar load of

23:19.277 --> 23:23.346
tungsten, and it's one of the
most valuable of his career.

23:23.348 --> 23:26.882
We can't handle any surprises
today, because it's so slippery.

23:26.884 --> 23:30.419
I guess we will have to
manage the best way we can.

23:30.421 --> 23:35.324
Narrator: And he's taking it
over the unforgiving mine road.

23:44.735 --> 23:48.337
The number one thing
here is icy conditions.

23:48.339 --> 23:54.143
So very little
traction for turning.

23:59.616 --> 24:05.921
Narrator: The road's barely
wider than a big rig.

24:05.923 --> 24:11.594
If Alex loses traction and slips
too close to the edge...

24:11.596 --> 24:16.332
gravity will do the rest.

24:31.114 --> 24:35.851
Come on, move, move!

24:35.853 --> 24:39.822
Get up the hill.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.694
I missed a shift.

24:50.033 --> 24:53.469
Whoa, boy.

24:53.471 --> 24:55.871
No...

25:01.878 --> 25:04.213
Stop!

25:04.215 --> 25:07.049
Narrator: Coming up...
[Honking]

25:07.051 --> 25:09.752
Holy motherfucker, look out.

25:09.754 --> 25:13.856
Narrator: Jackknife.

25:17.435 --> 25:21.472
Get up the hill!

25:21.474 --> 25:29.113
Narrator: - Riding 3,500 feet
above sea level... - Whoa, boy.

25:29.115 --> 25:31.648
Whoa!

25:31.650 --> 25:39.123
Narrator: Alex Debogorski's million-dollar
load of tungsten is out of control.

25:42.761 --> 25:47.297
Stop!

25:47.365 --> 25:54.538
Narrator: He missed a shift, sending
the truck rolling toward the edge.

25:54.540 --> 25:58.108
That wasn't exactly
what I wanted to do.

26:00.411 --> 26:05.549
Narrator: The veteran puts it in gear
for another shot at the 10% grade.

26:05.551 --> 26:09.086
Come on.

26:09.088 --> 26:12.923
Come on...

26:16.861 --> 26:19.196
You know, that's a
pretty long way down.

26:19.198 --> 26:24.001
I don't want to have
to have a closer look.

26:31.476 --> 26:33.610
Back in business.

26:33.612 --> 26:36.814
Narrator: Alex is over
the first major incline.

26:36.816 --> 26:37.614
Thank you, Lord.

26:37.616 --> 26:40.350
In Jesus' name, I pray, amen.

26:40.352 --> 26:46.423
Narrator: But over a dozen remain
on the 120 mile-long mine road.

26:46.425 --> 26:50.160
I guess we will have to
manage the best way we can.

26:50.162 --> 26:54.965
We still got a long way to go.

26:54.967 --> 27:00.404
Narrator: - 450 miles to the west...
- Really excited about pulling

27:00.406 --> 27:02.139
this thing up there.

27:02.207 --> 27:05.142
A machine like that
can cost $300,000.

27:05.210 --> 27:08.145
Narrator: Austin Wheeler's
riding high with an oversized

27:08.147 --> 27:11.882
plow on his first solo
heavy haul up the Dalton.

27:11.884 --> 27:15.786
Kinda shows people, uh, what I'm
made of and what I'm capable of.

27:15.788 --> 27:18.155
So I'm totally stoked for that.

27:18.157 --> 27:20.991
I think Lane gave this load to
me because he realized, like,

27:20.993 --> 27:24.027
yeah, "Austin is capable of
doing whatever I throw at him."

27:24.029 --> 27:27.297
And I am, I-I don't-- don't
let anybody down.

27:27.299 --> 27:32.069
I always try my hardest to get the
job done, no matter what it takes.

27:32.071 --> 27:36.840
Narrator: But just ahead is
25-mile hill, where drivers have

27:36.842 --> 27:40.711
to slow down for the left-hand
turn but keep enough momentum

27:40.713 --> 27:44.581
to make it up the 8% grade.

27:44.649 --> 27:45.949
I'd be on the ball up ahead.

27:45.951 --> 27:48.151
The road doesn't
look very pretty.

27:48.253 --> 27:51.021
All right, thank you, sir.

27:51.023 --> 27:54.024
Just got word from a driver over
the CB that this hill that

27:54.026 --> 27:55.759
we're climbing up
was a little slick.

27:55.761 --> 28:00.597
But, uh, the more I look at it and examine
the road, it doesn't look too slick at all.

28:00.599 --> 28:08.405
So, not gonna worry about
throwing chains on or nothin'.

28:21.619 --> 28:24.855
You can't even steer.

28:28.259 --> 28:33.597
Don't do this to me now.

28:33.599 --> 28:35.966
Fucking damn it!

28:35.968 --> 28:38.869
Huhhh!

28:40.571 --> 28:43.907
Narrator: Austin's call to try
the hill without chains has

28:43.909 --> 28:48.578
him right in the path
of oncoming traffic.

28:57.956 --> 28:58.588
[Honk]

28:58.590 --> 28:58.989
Oh, fuck.

28:58.991 --> 29:02.659
[Honk]

29:02.661 --> 29:06.563
Whoa!

29:16.474 --> 29:20.143
It's a pretty bad
situation to get into.

29:20.145 --> 29:22.112
People can't see you when
they're coming down the hill.

29:22.114 --> 29:25.115
That's why I tried to
hurry up and act fast.

29:25.117 --> 29:27.751
It's just a rookie mistake.

29:27.753 --> 29:32.122
It's pretty fucking stupid.

29:32.124 --> 29:36.293
Narrator: 50 miles to the north...
[Horn honking]

29:36.295 --> 29:40.731
With this load I got, it's, like,
cream of the crop right now.

29:40.733 --> 29:43.400
Narrator: Jack Jessee's racing
to Fairbanks to hold on

29:43.402 --> 29:46.837
to his lead in the load count.

29:46.839 --> 29:47.738
It's probably the easiest

29:47.772 --> 29:49.740
backhaul you could ever have.

29:49.742 --> 29:55.445
Just light enough that I can-- I can
make some really good time here.

29:55.513 --> 29:59.583
Narrator: But even a nice day
on the Dalton isn't easy.

29:59.585 --> 30:01.218
Sun's coming up more.

30:01.220 --> 30:06.156
It's low on the horizon.

30:06.158 --> 30:08.525
With all the ice in the road,
we're getting double glare.

30:08.527 --> 30:10.694
Everything's totally
white out here.

30:10.696 --> 30:17.801
I'll be seeing spots
for the next week.

30:17.803 --> 30:22.039
Can't see anything but
a big orange ball.

30:22.041 --> 30:23.974
[Truck honking]

30:23.976 --> 30:27.344
Holy motherfucker, look out.

30:27.346 --> 30:33.950
Damn slide.

30:43.961 --> 30:47.431
That almost took us
out right there.

30:47.433 --> 30:52.402
Motherfucker, whoa.

30:56.340 --> 31:04.147
Narrator: While Jack heads south,
battling the blinding sun...

31:04.149 --> 31:10.020
- 200 miles north...
- We got a nice rough stretch

31:10.022 --> 31:12.322
of road for a while.

31:12.423 --> 31:16.126
Narrator: Rival Darrell Ward
is heading into darkness.

31:16.128 --> 31:19.229
Man, you hit these rough
roads like this, man, you

31:19.231 --> 31:24.134
know, you can bust springs,
suspension, air bags, break wheels.

31:24.136 --> 31:31.141
Pretty hazardous.

31:31.143 --> 31:34.778
Whoa, fucking caribou, man.

31:34.780 --> 31:37.514
My brakes are locking up.

31:37.516 --> 31:41.017
Fuck.

31:41.019 --> 31:43.920
Narrator: - Coming up...
- I can't see a thing.

31:43.922 --> 31:46.056
Narrator: Porkchop
fights the ice.

31:46.058 --> 31:46.690
Oh, shit.

31:46.692 --> 31:48.191
[Honking]

31:50.503 --> 31:55.140
Narrator: - 150 miles south of Prudhoe Bay...
- I mean, it's-- it's rough.

31:55.142 --> 31:59.278
Narrator: After scoring an unexpected
haul, Darrell's racing north to get

31:59.280 --> 32:03.382
ahead of Jack in the load count.

32:03.384 --> 32:06.952
Whoa! Caribou, man.

32:06.954 --> 32:09.788
My brakes are locking up.

32:09.790 --> 32:10.856
Fuck.

32:10.858 --> 32:11.757
[Caribou noises]

32:11.759 --> 32:12.791
Whoa!

32:12.793 --> 32:20.432
[Honking]

32:20.434 --> 32:23.702
[Honking]

32:23.704 --> 32:30.208
Caribou, man, mysteriously appear
in the road, right in front of me.

32:30.210 --> 32:30.876
How?

32:30.878 --> 32:35.781
I don't know.

32:35.783 --> 32:37.582
Like a fucking freight train.

32:37.584 --> 32:39.051
They make a hole for me.

32:39.053 --> 32:40.485
It was close, man.

32:40.487 --> 32:45.857
I mean, it was real close.

32:45.859 --> 32:49.061
Narrator: - 70 miles to the north...
- Ready to get up here and

32:49.063 --> 32:51.797
get this load off and
get back to Fairbanks.

32:51.799 --> 32:54.633
Narrator: Porkchop's an hour
outside of Prudhoe Bay with a

32:54.635 --> 32:57.803
load of construction supplies.

32:57.805 --> 33:03.508
I got this.

33:03.510 --> 33:05.043
Southbound.

33:05.144 --> 33:06.345
Yeah, go ahead.

33:06.347 --> 33:07.979
Is it clear down there, buddy?

33:07.981 --> 33:10.682
A lot of fog all the way in.

33:10.684 --> 33:13.885
All the way, great.

33:13.887 --> 33:16.421
It's coming in.

33:16.423 --> 33:19.324
It wasn't there when I went
north a few hours ago.

33:19.425 --> 33:22.694
10-4, appreciate it, be careful.

33:22.696 --> 33:24.429
Just talked to a
driver on the radio.

33:24.431 --> 33:27.933
He said this fog's in and out,
all the way to Prudhoe.

33:27.935 --> 33:32.471
I don't know what ice fog is,
but it sucks driving in it.

33:32.473 --> 33:35.107
Shit.

33:35.109 --> 33:37.609
Frigging ridiculous.

33:44.717 --> 33:48.854
Visibility's down to about an
8th of a mile, maybe 1/4 mile.

33:48.856 --> 33:52.657
We went from great driving weather
to crappy driving weather.

33:52.659 --> 33:56.228
Narrator: At temperatures
below minus 40, water in the

33:56.230 --> 34:03.568
air freezes, forming a
thick fog made of ice.

34:03.570 --> 34:04.669
Made up a little bit of time.

34:04.671 --> 34:07.406
Now I'm losing it again,
'cause of all this ice fog.

34:07.408 --> 34:11.943
Ain't gonna catch a
break on time now.

34:11.945 --> 34:17.047
It's real treacherous right now
trying to see out through here.

34:22.554 --> 34:23.955
I can't see a thing.

34:23.956 --> 34:25.424
[Truck honking]

34:25.426 --> 34:30.161
Oh, fuck.

34:30.164 --> 34:34.733
Oh, shit!

34:34.735 --> 34:37.268
Man, it's real tough to see.

34:37.271 --> 34:44.376
The main thing is, I'd rather get there
safe than dead, that's for sure.

35:00.326 --> 35:03.061
Narrator: - Finally...
- Yee-haw!

35:03.063 --> 35:07.199
Narrator: The lights of Prudhoe
Bay break through the fog.

35:07.201 --> 35:10.902
You can't stop the Chop, baby.

35:10.904 --> 35:16.475
Narrator: And after two successful
solo runs, Porkchop's on a hot streak.

35:16.477 --> 35:18.276
Had a expedited load.

35:18.278 --> 35:19.911
Got it up here as
quick as I could.

35:19.913 --> 35:21.546
I got here safe and sound.

35:21.548 --> 35:24.316
I'm a long way from my family,
I'ma here in Prudhoe, and

35:24.318 --> 35:27.519
I miss my family, but it's
one more for them, too.

35:30.156 --> 35:37.162
Narrator: - 2,000 miles to the southeast...
- That must be Pauingassi, up there.

35:37.164 --> 35:40.432
Narrator: Hugh's managed to get
his convoy across the ice

35:40.434 --> 35:42.834
and up the winter roads.

35:42.836 --> 35:44.536
Okay, we're in Pauingassi.

35:44.538 --> 35:47.172
That's where we're at, this is
where we're supposed to be.

35:47.174 --> 35:49.174
End of the journey, man.

35:49.176 --> 35:50.909
Holy fuck!

35:50.911 --> 35:54.246
[Laughing] Hey, wow.

35:54.248 --> 35:58.183
I'm just gonna park up here, make sure
there's enough room for everybody.

35:58.284 --> 36:00.452
We're late.

36:00.454 --> 36:03.455
But we're here.

36:06.058 --> 36:08.393
Narrator: But the late arrival
means there's no one

36:08.395 --> 36:12.898
around to off-load the cargo.

36:12.900 --> 36:16.568
Unfortunately, you know, we got
here, you know, six or seven

36:16.570 --> 36:22.641
hours later than we were supposed to and...
I cannot leave the trailers up here.

36:22.643 --> 36:25.243
I don't believe they open up
till, like, noon tomorrow.

36:25.245 --> 36:28.613
So we lose about seven hours.

36:33.052 --> 36:36.521
Narrator: But for Hugh, there's no
time for another failed trip...

36:36.523 --> 36:38.990
We ain't got much
time to sit around.

36:38.992 --> 36:42.794
Narrator: And the Polar Bear takes
matters into his own hands.

36:42.796 --> 36:43.728
I'm not quittin'.

36:43.730 --> 36:44.996
I never quit.

36:45.097 --> 36:47.432
Well, we found a loader.

36:47.434 --> 36:51.169
And luckily, Hugh is here with
us, so he can jump in it.

36:51.171 --> 36:57.142
I know he loves those things and
he's got a couple of 'em at home.

36:57.144 --> 36:59.711
What the hell?

36:59.713 --> 37:02.781
Narrator: But the
forklift is busted.

37:02.783 --> 37:05.250
What if he brings this fork
down, then we just-- Can we

37:05.252 --> 37:08.787
lift up that other fork at all?

37:08.789 --> 37:11.656
Well, I thought it was going
to be an easy job, but the

37:11.658 --> 37:16.695
forks are pretty bended,
so we cannot lift them up.

37:16.697 --> 37:22.601
Narrator: Once again,
Hugh's forced to improvise.

37:26.305 --> 37:31.610
All depends on Hugh, how good
he's gonna be with that loader.

37:34.046 --> 37:38.216
Watch out, there we go!

37:38.218 --> 37:46.391
Narrator: Each bag weighs over 3,000
pounds and is worth 500 bucks.

37:46.393 --> 37:48.493
Careful, careful, careful!

37:48.561 --> 37:56.101
You know, this takes some guts to
try to do something like that.

38:01.240 --> 38:04.309
Oh!

38:04.311 --> 38:07.479
Narrator: - Coming up... - It feels like
it's my turn to kick some butt now.

38:07.481 --> 38:09.214
Narrator: The rivalry
gets personal.

38:09.216 --> 38:11.182
Sucks to be you, Jack.

38:11.184 --> 38:13.184
No BSing around.

38:13.186 --> 38:14.019
Get the job done.

38:16.219 --> 38:20.989
Narrator: - In Manitoba, Canada...
- Really bouncing.

38:20.991 --> 38:22.390
I'll be glad when we're done.

38:22.458 --> 38:25.827
Narrator: After showing up
late for the off-load, Hugh's

38:25.829 --> 38:31.333
taking matters into his own hands
to get three loads on the books.

38:31.335 --> 38:33.168
Oh!

38:33.170 --> 38:35.337
You gotta be jokin'.

38:35.339 --> 38:39.407
Narrator: But the cement bags are
barely making it off the trucks intact.

38:39.475 --> 38:44.946
You know, it's, uh, $500
each bag, multiplied by 39.

38:44.948 --> 38:48.617
Basically, you're losing a
profit for the whole season.

38:48.619 --> 38:51.520
Narrator: There's nearly
$20,000 on the line, and just

38:51.522 --> 38:55.123
one busted bag will eat
away at Hugh's profit.

38:55.125 --> 38:59.227
Ah, fuck. This thing's
coming right off.

38:59.295 --> 39:03.965
Oh, fuck!

39:03.967 --> 39:05.233
Damn it!

39:05.235 --> 39:09.070
Yeah, we got one truck unloaded,
now, and two more to go.

39:09.072 --> 39:16.978
Narrator: - 13 bags down...
- Watch yourself, he's gonna back up.

39:16.980 --> 39:20.615
Narrator: 26 to go.

39:20.617 --> 39:23.785
You're good!

39:26.522 --> 39:27.589
[Wood cracking]

39:27.591 --> 39:30.125
Come on!

39:30.192 --> 39:32.427
Oh, it's gonna be a
long, long night.

39:32.495 --> 39:36.598
Narrator: - So far...
- This is a great, big clusterfuck.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.334
Narrator: The bags are
battered but unbroken.

39:39.336 --> 39:45.507
I've just about had
enough of that shit.

39:45.509 --> 39:49.210
Come on, come on, stick with it.

39:49.212 --> 39:55.383
[Wood creaking]

39:55.385 --> 40:00.488
What's going on,
I just about had her.

40:06.996 --> 40:08.830
Hell, yeah!

40:08.832 --> 40:14.769
Narrator: - After a rough start...
- That bag's not damaged.

40:14.837 --> 40:17.339
Narrator: Polar Bear
gets the hang of it.

40:17.341 --> 40:20.141
We basically had to chain every
bag up, and that, uh, I

40:20.143 --> 40:22.510
don't know what it took, four
or five hours to unload all

40:22.512 --> 40:24.045
three loads, but we got 'em off.

40:24.047 --> 40:27.048
Mission Impossible, done.

40:27.050 --> 40:30.852
It's, like, 4:00 or
5:00 in the morning.

40:30.854 --> 40:36.825
I'm dirty, I'm soaked, I'm
tired, I'm hungry, but we got

40:36.827 --> 40:42.964
the load done, and that's
the most important thing.

40:42.966 --> 40:45.967
[Honk]

40:45.969 --> 40:50.739
Narrator: 1,800 miles
to the northwest...

40:54.877 --> 40:57.178
We're starting into crunch
time right now, and

40:57.180 --> 40:58.847
this is where it really matters.

40:58.849 --> 41:03.652
Narrator: Haul road ace Jack
Jessee pulls into Carlile and

41:03.654 --> 41:06.588
takes the lead in
the load count.

41:06.590 --> 41:08.556
No BSing around.

41:08.558 --> 41:10.925
Get the job done.

41:10.927 --> 41:15.397
Feels like it's my turn
to kick some butt now.

41:15.399 --> 41:19.501
Narrator: - But at the other end of the
Dalton... - Got the lights of Prudhoe

41:19.503 --> 41:22.137
Bay right here ahead of me.

41:22.139 --> 41:24.939
Narrator: Jack's lead is
short-lived, as Darrell delivers

41:24.941 --> 41:27.108
his load of drill pipe.

41:27.110 --> 41:29.010
It was a perfect day for me.

41:29.012 --> 41:32.013
Life is good today.

41:32.015 --> 41:35.650
Sucks to be you, Jack.

41:35.652 --> 41:38.486
Go in here, and see if dispatch
is around, if there's anybody

41:38.488 --> 41:44.926
here, and figure out which ones of these
pieces of paper I need to turn in.

41:44.928 --> 41:46.928
Nobody here, huh?

41:46.930 --> 41:49.097
Well, that blows.

41:49.099 --> 41:51.366
Inbound, outbound.

41:51.368 --> 41:54.035
Well, okay, do I
have anything here?

41:54.037 --> 41:55.570
Ward, Darrell, here we go.

41:55.572 --> 41:56.738
Line haul manifest.

41:56.740 --> 41:57.639
Let's go find it.

41:57.641 --> 42:01.042
RV, 1173.

42:01.044 --> 42:04.079
Narrator: The day started with
a backhaul for Jack, but it

42:04.081 --> 42:07.649
ends with a backhaul for
the Montana legend.

42:07.651 --> 42:10.051
I was a little pissed off last
night over the whole deal

42:10.053 --> 42:13.788
and made it to Coldfoot, and
there's a load sitting right

42:13.790 --> 42:16.658
there for me, you know?

42:16.660 --> 42:20.228
And I'm already caught up
to Jack in the load count.

42:20.230 --> 42:22.731
You know, Jack's gonna
be following me.

42:22.733 --> 42:25.500
Narrator: And now, Darrell's
the one with the upper hand.

42:25.502 --> 42:29.838
The good lord looks after those
who take care of themselves.

42:29.840 --> 42:33.541
Narrator: But while the two
heavyweights battle it out...

42:33.543 --> 42:36.010
We're unloading this
steiger machine.

42:36.012 --> 42:37.579
[Hammering]

42:37.581 --> 42:40.682
Narrator: 23-year-old Austin
Wheeler's hot on their heels

42:40.684 --> 42:43.918
with the delivery of his
first solo heavy haul.

42:43.920 --> 42:45.754
Took some real
thought and skill.

42:45.756 --> 42:47.188
It's been a really long day.

42:47.190 --> 42:48.857
I'm tired.

42:48.859 --> 42:51.126
It's time to go to bed.

42:53.462 --> 43:00.668
Narrator: And now there's a three-way
tie for the load count lead.

43:00.770 --> 43:05.440
- In Canada...
- Load's been delivered.

43:05.442 --> 43:06.908
I made it.

43:06.910 --> 43:09.377
Narrator: Alex pulls into
Watson Lake with his

43:09.379 --> 43:12.480
million-dollar load
of tungsten ore.

43:12.482 --> 43:15.316
North is great, the ice is
great, but if they wanna send

43:15.318 --> 43:17.919
me back to another mine,
that's fine, too.

43:17.921 --> 43:22.457
I'll go wherever they send me.

43:22.459 --> 43:25.326
Narrator: Next time on
<i>Ice Road Truckers ...</i>

43:25.328 --> 43:28.029
<i>I'm seeing a whole
bunch of white.</i>

43:28.031 --> 43:29.297
<i>Where are we?</i>

43:29.299 --> 43:33.535
<i>Narrator: The veteran
fights hurricane alley.</i>

43:33.537 --> 43:36.638
<i>Yeah, I don't think this
is a very good idea.</i>

43:36.739 --> 43:39.541
<i>Narrator: - In Alaska...
- Come on, Kitty Kenworth.</i>

43:39.543 --> 43:41.954
<i>The Dalton fights back.</i>

43:41.955 --> 43:44.002
<i>Holy shit!</i>

43:47.003 --> 43:52.058
<i>And no one is safe...
form mother nature's fury.</i>

43:54.059 --> 43:55.852
<i>Fuck me!</i>
