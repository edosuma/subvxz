What do you guys think it is?

16:39.521 --> 16:40.920
Is that French or is that German?

16:40.955 --> 16:42.416
I know, that's what I'm saying, right?

16:43.391 --> 16:44.366
I wanna try this, man.

16:44.391 --> 16:45.691
I told him to do, he's gotta do the walk

16:45.716 --> 16:47.904
- and the-the thing right?
- all: Whoa!

16:47.929 --> 16:49.562
Look at this guy right here!

16:49.597 --> 16:52.031
- <i>Herr</i> Quinn.
- Oh, my gosh.

16:52.056 --> 16:53.639
<i>- Herr</i> Quinn.
- I thought my shirt was gonna be

16:53.664 --> 16:55.501
the ugliest thing here tonight.

16:55.537 --> 16:56.512
- Look at this! Look at this!
- <i>Willkommen. Willkommen.</i>

16:56.537 --> 16:57.467
- Herr Brian.
- Oh, my God!

16:57.492 --> 16:58.567
- That far in.
- Do you know what this is?

16:58.623 --> 16:59.690
Holy crap.

16:59.715 --> 17:01.415
Oh, my goodness gracious, dude.

17:05.432 --> 17:06.751
Show her to her seat. 'Cause I...

17:06.776 --> 17:07.880
- Okay.
- Before you say something

17:07.915 --> 17:09.248

- All right.

17:17.724 --> 17:21.461
- Oh, come on, man!
- [laughing]

17:21.496 --> 17:23.896
Right before the show began,

17:23.932 --> 17:26.152
I saw Ming for the first time backstage,

17:26.176 --> 17:27.179
and, you know, I just remembered,

17:27.204 --> 17:28.899
"I wore that costume"
and still, I was like,

17:28.924 --> 17:30.083
"You look (bleep) up."

17:30.108 --> 17:31.471
[laughter]

17:31.506 --> 17:32.937
- What do you think?
- Turn around. It sounds sexist.

17:32.962 --> 17:34.012
But give me a twirl.

17:34.037 --> 17:35.575
- That looks phenomenal.
- Hey, only for you.

17:35.610 --> 17:37.076
- Happy birthday.
- All right.

17:37.111 --> 17:38.611
You intro and have a
(bleep) fantastic time.

17:38.646 --> 17:40.303
- Intro?
- Yeah, what you're doing.

17:40.328 --> 17:42.815
Oh, you didn't know?
You will intro Harley.

17:42.851 --> 17:44.984
And Harley will intro me.

17:45.019 --> 17:47.954
[cheers and applause]

17:49.858 --> 17:51.457
Whoo!

17:51.493 --> 17:54.460
<i>[percussive music]</i>

<i>Willkommen,</i> ladies and gentlemen,

18:01.959 --> 18:04.300
Put it together for ze Fraeulein,

Miss Harley Quinn Smith,

18:05.950 --> 18:08.508
ze star of ze "Yoga Hosers."

18:08.533 --> 18:09.344
[cheers and applause]

<i>Danke schoen, danke schoen.</i>

18:11.112 --> 18:13.012
[applause]

18:13.047 --> 18:16.482
- That is terrifying.
- [laughter]

18:16.518 --> 18:18.518
He freaked my kid out. I know that much.

18:18.553 --> 18:21.621
She... she... and she's in a
movie with the original Bratzi.

18:21.656 --> 18:22.922
- Yeah.
- But I was never

18:22.957 --> 18:24.711
on set with her. That was the first time

18:24.736 --> 18:26.792
she saw someone in the
makeup in real life.

18:26.817 --> 18:29.743
Couldn't get out of her mind
the sweaty little sausage

18:29.768 --> 18:31.664
in the back room that
was like, "Hi, Harley."

18:31.699 --> 18:33.799
And he was out of the costume by then.

18:33.835 --> 18:37.336
[laughter]

18:37.372 --> 18:40.980
We were in Indianapolis,
uh, showing "Yoga Hosers,"

18:41.005 --> 18:44.210
and I-I intro'd my
dad, like I'm doing now.

18:44.245 --> 18:46.012
But now, since it's his birthday,

18:46.047 --> 18:47.947
I figured, let me roast him.

18:47.982 --> 18:48.802
Yeah!

18:48.826 --> 18:50.826
- So...
- [cheers and applause]

18:53.238 --> 18:54.687
Cool, right? Okay.

18:54.722 --> 18:58.224
My dad likes to talk, as you've noticed.

18:58.259 --> 18:59.559
- Um...
- [laughter]

18:59.594 --> 19:01.994
But we tend to be paired for interviews.

19:02.030 --> 19:05.798
And the interviewer will
ask a question to both of us,

19:05.833 --> 19:08.549
then, like, I'll maybe
open my mouth to say a word,

19:08.574 --> 19:11.170
and then my dad will just
tell a 45-minute answer

19:11.205 --> 19:14.661
that, like, probably won't even answer

19:14.686 --> 19:17.993
the question being asked,
so it will literally be like,

19:18.018 --> 19:18.955
"What was your favorite part

19:18.980 --> 19:20.165
about working with your daughter?"

19:20.190 --> 19:22.292
And then he'll be like, "Well,
I was born in New Jersey,

19:22.317 --> 19:24.930
- and then all this happened."
- [laughter]

19:24.955 --> 19:26.696
And that actually happens all the time.

19:26.721 --> 19:29.388
So without further ado,

19:29.424 --> 19:31.557
Kevin Smith.

19:31.593 --> 19:35.328
[cheers and applause]

19:35.363 --> 19:37.029
I...

19:41.036 --> 19:43.363
Harley Quinn, ladies and gentlemen.

19:43.388 --> 19:45.237
[cheers and applause]

19:45.273 --> 19:47.373
Hey!

19:48.562 --> 19:51.481
The movie you're about to see
is technically a kid's movie.

19:51.506 --> 19:53.233
It was made for children.

19:53.258 --> 19:56.003
Um, it's made for
adults, if you're blazed.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.550
You'll really enjoy it.

19:57.585 --> 19:59.285
[laughter]

19:59.320 --> 20:02.299
We had a screening at the
Indy PopCon in Indianapolis,

20:02.324 --> 20:03.951
and there was a little girl who stood up

20:03.976 --> 20:05.108
at the end of the screening.

20:05.133 --> 20:06.559
I said, "Let me tell
you something right now."

20:06.594 --> 20:07.960
I said, "This is crazy.

20:07.996 --> 20:10.516
"When I made the movie,
I made it for you.

20:10.541 --> 20:12.284
"I was thinking about you
when I made this movie.

20:12.309 --> 20:13.233
Not you, that'd be creepy..."

20:13.258 --> 20:15.244
[audience laughing]
"But just you in general.

20:15.269 --> 20:16.869
"Like, you know, I wasn't
thinking about normally

20:16.904 --> 20:18.417
"people my age, that's
who I think about.

20:18.442 --> 20:21.217
"I was thinking about, like,
little girls, tween girls.

20:21.242 --> 20:23.730
"So only person in the
world I really give a (bleep)

20:23.755 --> 20:25.811
to find out what did
you think of this movie?"

20:25.847 --> 20:27.446
And the little nine-year-old girl goes,

20:27.482 --> 20:30.562
"I liked it when the girls
hit things with sticks."

20:30.587 --> 20:31.951
[laughter]

20:31.986 --> 20:34.253
And I was like, "That (bleep)
going on the (bleep) poster."

20:34.288 --> 20:36.155
[laughter]

20:36.463 --> 20:38.743
So, ladies and gentlemen,
get ready to watch

20:38.768 --> 20:40.793
girls hit things with sticks!

20:40.828 --> 20:43.262
"Yoga Hosers."

20:43.297 --> 20:46.232
[cheers and applause]

20:48.936 --> 20:51.083
That's all the time we
got for this week, man.

20:51.108 --> 20:52.905
For "Comic Book Men," I'm Kevin Smith.

20:52.940 --> 20:54.607
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:54.642 --> 20:55.841

- Ming Chen.

20:55.877 --> 20:57.151
Remember, kids,

20:57.176 --> 20:59.322
making a movie with
your family and friends

20:59.347 --> 21:00.876
is what it's all "aboot."

21:00.901 --> 21:02.134
Good night.
