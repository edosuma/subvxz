WEBVTT

00:36.036 --> 00:38.653
Mr. Andrews, Mr. Kudo, Mr. Fairchild.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.238
Morning.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.829
Mr. Jensen,
didn't see you at the History Club meeting.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.868
That was the idea.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.833
Mr. Edwards, how did the castration go
on that polo pony?

00:49.132 --> 00:50.247
You're next, pal.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.508
Nice tie, teach. Clip-on?

00:53.095 --> 00:55.257
- Daddy's boy.
- Bite me!

00:57.266 --> 00:59.348
Wellington Academy. Are you white?

00:59.643 --> 01:01.725
Hold, please. I'll put you right through.

01:04.605 --> 01:06.768
Wellington Academy. Are you white?

01:07.526 --> 01:08.812
Hold, please. I'll put you through.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.989
Mr. Clark, your father's waiting for you.

01:20.330 --> 01:23.038
How are you doing, Mr. Clark?
Looking good.

01:23.333 --> 01:26.200
- Thank you, Mr. Kuntzler, I'm fine.
- Good.

01:31.425 --> 01:34.008
There he is, the man of the hour.

01:38.807 --> 01:42.300
Son, don't just stand there. Come join us.

01:42.978 --> 01:45.094
For a moment,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

01:45.397 --> 01:46.762
Father, I really need to talk to you.

01:47.065 --> 01:50.478
Plenty of time for that, son.
Sit down. I have something to tell you.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.360
Sit down, Richard, and smoke.

01:53.905 --> 01:57.273
- But, Father--
- Now, everyone smokes a pipe here.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.158
I do it. Your grandfather did it.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.989
Even the Indians smoked on this land...

02:01.288 --> 02:04.280
before they traded it away
for some chickens and a pound of jewelry.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.790
- But, Father, I hate--
- Suck.

02:07.711 --> 02:12.046
Son, it gives me great pleasure
to announce that we're promoting you...

02:12.341 --> 02:15.208
to Assistant Vice Chairman
of the History Department.

02:17.596 --> 02:19.553
Father, that's why we have to talk.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.464
Yes, there's lots to talk about.

02:21.767 --> 02:24.509
You'll need a telephone,
and we'll move you from the basement--

02:24.811 --> 02:28.224
Father, for once in your life,
will you just listen to me?

02:28.523 --> 02:29.763
Oh, my--

02:33.487 --> 02:35.524
Look, I've taken a job...

02:36.573 --> 02:38.063
at Barry High School.

02:39.242 --> 02:44.032
For the moment, I will assume that you've
found a sense of humor and are joking.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.537
I'm not joking.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.574
Richard, if you do this, you will fail.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.618
You will fail.

02:51.421 --> 02:55.210
And mark my words, you'll come crawling
back here with your tail between your legs.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.718
You're wrong, Father.
I'm going to succeed at Barry High School.

02:59.012 --> 03:03.472
And I have no intention of ever crawling
back here with anything between my legs.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.872
Barry High.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.858
Hey, could you point me
to the faculty parking lot?

04:39.446 --> 04:40.811
Thanks a lot.

05:53.728 --> 05:54.889
Where?

06:18.378 --> 06:19.868
Beautiful morning.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.721
- Come on, give me a break.
- All right.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.182
Man.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.142
Hold it. What is this?

06:44.571 --> 06:48.280
- No, wait a minute.
- What the heck is this? Get on in there.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.107
Come here.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.736
- You had them last week.
- Know what you mean.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.996
All right, give me $3.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.868
My brother, 24 carats, $24.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.128
No, thank you. I already have a--

07:10.430 --> 07:13.764
<i>Falique Abdul, please come to the office.
One of your fathers is here.</i>

07:15.018 --> 07:16.474
You watch it, okay. Okay?

07:21.149 --> 07:23.265
- Who's that?
- How the hell should I know?

07:34.913 --> 07:38.122
Well, what have we got here?
Griff, welcome back, bro.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.373
So you finally got what you wanted?

07:40.669 --> 07:43.957
It's a nice little business.
Keeps us in pocket change.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.792
I knew it was you that set me up, bro.

07:47.092 --> 07:50.676
If it bothers you that much,
go ahead, make your move.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.133
Or did that year in juvie soften your cheese?

07:53.431 --> 07:56.674
This is my turf now.
You show me respect. Me.

07:56.977 --> 08:00.220
Paco de la Vega-El Camino-Cordova-Jose
Cuervo-Sanchez-Rodriguez...

08:02.148 --> 08:03.309
Junior.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.274
Are we not forgetting a name?

08:06.820 --> 08:08.777
- What's that?
- Skid mark.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.566
All right, you toughs. Break it up.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.992
Now, cut it out.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.079
You boys ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.536
School is no place for fighting.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.791
What are you looking for?

08:24.087 --> 08:25.543
I'm looking for the rest your posse...

08:25.839 --> 08:28.376
that's going to keep me
from ripping you a new asshole.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.960
I will pretend for the moment
that you meant that in a nice way.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.674
But I am warning you,
I'm about to lose my temper.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.135
Now, I want you boys to shake hands.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.049
Go on.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.513
There. See?

08:46.276 --> 08:48.358
Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?

08:49.654 --> 08:53.818
It's always best to shake hands,
unless someone just sneezed into it...

08:55.201 --> 08:58.569
or if they have a stump.
That could be a little weird.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.739
All right, now go on, everybody.
Get back to class.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.077
Cross me again, Griffy-boy...

09:03.376 --> 09:05.492
and even Mr. Rogers here
won't be able to save your ass.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.127
- Go on. Bye.
- Let's go, dogs.

09:08.423 --> 09:11.290
Gentlemen, I believe classes are this way.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.709
They're not at school here anymore.

09:14.012 --> 09:16.549
- Are you in school here?
- Yeah.

09:17.474 --> 09:20.011
- First day?
- No, not really. I was--

09:20.310 --> 09:23.928
Mine, too. I'm a new teacher, Mr. Clark.
What's your name?

09:24.230 --> 09:27.188
- Griff McReynolds.
- Nice to meet you, Griff.

09:27.484 --> 09:31.102
You know, son,
I remember my first day at school.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.520
Hope you live through this one, chump.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.863
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

09:36.159 --> 09:40.244
<i>Today begins sexual awareness week.
Please contact Nurse Johnson in the hall.</i>

09:41.164 --> 09:43.155
Here you go, you little slut.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.540
Excuse me. I'm looking for Room 134.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.118
Thank you.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.379
<i>Keep moving. I repeat, keep moving.</i>

09:51.925 --> 09:53.586
<i>Pick up that can.</i>

09:53.885 --> 09:56.627
<i>Where are you going?
The little girls' room is that way.</i>

09:56.930 --> 09:59.046
<i>Hey, take off those colors.</i>

09:59.349 --> 10:01.556
<i>Yeah, you. Lose the cigarette.</i>

10:04.479 --> 10:07.471
<i>Take a hike, Gumby.
Get rid of the sunglasses.</i>

10:07.774 --> 10:10.641
Excuse me. But this kind of behavior...

10:10.944 --> 10:13.606
I'd bet the principal would frown
on this sort of thing.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.816
Evelyn Doyle, Principal.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.950
Look, pinhead, I don't know
what nursery school you come from...

10:20.245 --> 10:22.282
but here you screw up, you die.

10:22.580 --> 10:26.323
Every bad kid in the city
is dumped into our laps.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.492
Excuse me, Ms. Doyle, with all due respect...

10:28.795 --> 10:30.957
I don't think there is such a thing
as a bad kid.

10:31.256 --> 10:34.669
At least, they don't start off that way.
They just need someone they can relate to...

10:34.968 --> 10:38.461
and I can reach them.
I know what's def, what's wack...

10:38.763 --> 10:40.845
what's jam, what's straight-up booty.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.429
Mr. Clark,
how long have you been teaching here?

10:45.103 --> 10:46.559
Twenty minutes!

10:46.855 --> 10:51.099
I've been here over 20 years.
Don't you question my authority on this.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.937
Excuse me.

10:57.782 --> 10:58.943
Pardon me.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.358
Are you having a hard time
finding your way around?

11:01.661 --> 11:03.322
Yes. I'm looking...

11:03.872 --> 11:05.488
for Room 134.

11:06.958 --> 11:09.575
- Hi. Victoria Chapell.
- Richard Clark.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.961
Nice to meet you, Mr. Clark.
It's down this way.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.706
What do you teach, Ms. Chapell?

11:16.009 --> 11:19.047
I'm Principal Doyle's
administrative assistant.

11:20.263 --> 11:23.255
Drama coach. You did say Room 134?

11:23.933 --> 11:24.889
Yes.

11:26.769 --> 11:30.478
This is it. All of our classrooms
are in dire need of repair.

11:30.773 --> 11:34.266
Ever since the legislature passed
that "Three F's and You're Out" law...

11:34.569 --> 11:36.151
a lot of schools have closed.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.154
The school board decided
it just wasn't worth it.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.907
I guess they just gave up on these kids.

11:42.327 --> 11:45.410
So we've been squeezed for money
ever since.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.992
We've been forced to--

11:52.587 --> 11:54.624
Guess I'll get that later.

11:55.173 --> 11:58.382
Mr. Clark, are you by any chance related
to Thaddeus Clark...

11:58.676 --> 12:00.132
Headmaster at the Wellington School?

12:00.428 --> 12:02.294
Yeah. He's my father.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.930
Every school in the district
uses his book as a faculty primer.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.976
You know,
I don't see the family resemblance.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.888
Most people think I take after my mum.

12:13.942 --> 12:17.151
Look at this place.
Boy, it has great character.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.191
Sure, it needs a little paint and plaster...

12:23.868 --> 12:25.450
and floorboards...

12:30.583 --> 12:32.119
and pest control.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.246
With a little elbow grease--

12:39.425 --> 12:40.540
Jesus!

12:41.469 --> 12:45.053
And some new wiring,
she'll be back to shape in no time.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.802
Smell those seats.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.846
It says, "Teach me. I want to learn."

12:55.817 --> 12:59.185
- You must think I'm a silly idealist.
- No.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.400
I really admire your dedication.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.780
Your wife must be very proud of you.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.283
Actually, I'm not married.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.784
I find that surprising.

13:14.043 --> 13:17.456
It's pretty hard to be married,
if you've never had a steady girlfriend.

13:18.006 --> 13:22.751
I'm much too busy with work
to think about much else other than work.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.553
That's very admirable.

13:27.849 --> 13:31.683
The last time I heard someone talk like that
was old Mr. Riley.

13:31.978 --> 13:35.016
He was head of the History Department
until last semester.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.555
Retired?

13:36.858 --> 13:39.600
If you can call
being beaten to death retiring.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.017
Coffee?

13:45.950 --> 13:47.281
The lounge.

13:51.039 --> 13:54.327
- I'm going in. Cover me.
- Good luck in Home Ec, Lou.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.004
It's a little early to start drinking,
don't you think?

14:02.300 --> 14:03.540
Who stops?

14:08.973 --> 14:11.806
Hi, I'm Richard Clark.
I'm a new history teacher here.

14:14.896 --> 14:18.685
- What department do you teach in?
- I don't know. Something on the third floor.

14:20.651 --> 14:23.234
Richard, I'd like you to meet somebody.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.230
This is Bernie Raveling,
our athletic director, and...

14:27.533 --> 14:29.444
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Raveling.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.702
- Letting the moustache grow in, I see.
- Richard--

14:32.997 --> 14:35.534
From the looks of the stubble,
I'd say it's going to be a beaut.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.415
I had one in college myself.

14:37.710 --> 14:41.123
Richard, that's Ms. Wells,
the girls' gym teacher.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.754
Did I mention how attractive you look,
Ms. Wells?

14:47.053 --> 14:50.296
That blue sweat suit really brings out
the color of your eyes.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.965
You coming on to me, pickle dick?

14:53.267 --> 14:55.258
No. I'd never dream of it.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.854
- Not good enough for you?
- Well, it's been a real pleasure.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.310
They should really fix the lighting in here.

15:09.700 --> 15:13.659
<i>All right, settle down, you people.</i>

15:14.247 --> 15:16.363
<i>Knock it off. Quiet!</i>

15:17.208 --> 15:18.744
<i>I want quiet.</i>

15:20.920 --> 15:25.164
<i>It's a new semester.
That means new I.D. cards...</i>

15:26.008 --> 15:28.966
<i>strip searches and fresh fingerprints.</i>

15:30.304 --> 15:31.669
Shut up!

15:35.935 --> 15:38.393
<i>As you know, Mr. Arnott...</i>

15:38.688 --> 15:41.806
<i>our assistant principal, is still missing.</i>

15:42.108 --> 15:45.442
<i>If you know of his whereabouts,
or if you have him...</i>

15:45.736 --> 15:47.647
<i>contact me immediately.</i>

15:48.114 --> 15:51.277
<i>And also don't forget,
in less than two months...</i>

15:51.576 --> 15:55.114
<i>the state will administer
the Academic Proficiency Test.</i>

15:55.705 --> 16:00.666
<i>Anyone planning on going to college
is required to take these exams.</i>

16:01.544 --> 16:03.831
<i>Don't forget Career Day on Fridays.</i>

16:04.130 --> 16:06.997
<i>The United States Marines
and the Michigan Militia...</i>

16:07.300 --> 16:09.758
<i>will have recruiters here on campus.</i>

16:10.178 --> 16:11.964
<i>All right, listen up!</i>

16:12.638 --> 16:14.128
<i>We have a new teacher.</i>

16:14.432 --> 16:16.343
<i>His name is Richard Clark.</i>

16:16.642 --> 16:18.258
<i>It's his first day.</i>

16:18.561 --> 16:23.021
<i>Give him at least a week
before you do something terrible to him.</i>

16:23.524 --> 16:25.606
<i>Mr. Clark, do you have anything fo say?</i>

16:25.902 --> 16:27.358
<i>Now, you all should know--</i>

16:27.653 --> 16:29.235
Actually, yes.

16:32.283 --> 16:36.868
<i>I was asked a while back,
what teaching meant to me.</i>

16:37.538 --> 16:41.577
<i>My reward,
is being able to shape and mold...</i>

16:41.876 --> 16:44.208
<i>agile young minds like yours.</i>

16:44.504 --> 16:47.337
<i>Someday you will be the world's leaders.</i>

16:50.885 --> 16:53.798
<i>But the important thing is,</i> I <i>see in</i> you...

16:54.430 --> 16:56.296
<i>the future of America.</i>

16:56.849 --> 16:58.339
You suck!

16:59.060 --> 17:00.516
That's enough, miss!

17:03.814 --> 17:05.851
She's the school's librarian.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.982
Jeez, talk about low morale.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.404
All right, please settle down.

17:30.341 --> 17:32.833
There. That's more like it.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.880
I know.

17:35.346 --> 17:36.711
I'm the enemy.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.925
I'm the "grown-up."

17:40.643 --> 17:43.180
But, darn it, I was a kid once, too.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.767
And I haven't led a choirboy's life.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.728
I've got my share of parking tickets.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.018
At a baseball game once...

17:53.990 --> 17:56.527
I moved down to the expensive seats.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.443
Yeah. I'm not proud of it.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.076
In order to get to know you...

18:04.375 --> 18:06.286
I've devised a little system.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.917
When I call your name...

18:08.212 --> 18:09.953
I would like you to stand up...

18:10.256 --> 18:12.714
and then you tell me a little something
about yourself.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.920
Natalie Thompson.

18:18.723 --> 18:21.636
- Is there a Natalie Thompson here?
- I'm here.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.016
- What's up, girl?
- Why are you late?

18:24.312 --> 18:27.475
- Because the bell rang before I got here.
- Well--

18:31.861 --> 18:36.071
All right. Before you came in, we were just
talking about sharing personal information.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.606
Perhaps you can tell us something
about yourself.

18:38.909 --> 18:42.027
For the last week,
I've had a yeast infection that's extremely--

18:42.330 --> 18:43.946
Not that personal.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.116
Something about what you enjoy doing.

18:47.418 --> 18:48.908
I like writing poetry.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.957
A poet. I love poetry.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.590
Perhaps you have a nice one
you'd like to share with us.

18:55.885 --> 18:56.920
Okay.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.720
Here's one I wrote yesterday.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.716
"Oh, hopelessness

19:05.561 --> 19:07.768
"unrelenting, blood-drenched

19:08.064 --> 19:11.273
"intestine-twisting hopelessness

19:11.692 --> 19:16.778
"So thick and mucous-like
in a stinking, vomit-filled void

19:18.074 --> 19:20.987
"I am but a rancid carcass on the highway

19:21.285 --> 19:23.196
"Road kill for the maggots

19:23.496 --> 19:27.034
"Floating in shark-filled bile,
like wildebeest entrails"

19:27.667 --> 19:30.455
That's as far as I got.
I would have finished but...

19:30.753 --> 19:34.041
I couldn't find anything
to rhyme with "festering drippage."

19:36.008 --> 19:38.045
Well, thank you, Natalie.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.256
Is it Anthony Jefferson?

19:41.931 --> 19:43.137
Anferny.

19:43.808 --> 19:44.843
I beg your pardon?

19:45.142 --> 19:49.306
- Anferny.
- Anferny?

19:51.440 --> 19:54.523
Anferny, I thought I wrote it down wrong.

19:56.028 --> 19:59.441
All right. Tell us a little something
about yourself, Anferny.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.448
You know. I like chilling with my boys...

20:02.743 --> 20:04.575
blazing up a fat blunt...

20:04.870 --> 20:06.406
rizzeezing my mizzonkey...

20:06.706 --> 20:08.538
hitting skins with my old lady...

20:08.833 --> 20:11.746
hanging my ass over the line,
tagging freeway bridges.

20:12.044 --> 20:15.207
I'm down with that poetry shit, too.
You want to hear?

20:16.173 --> 20:17.755
- Sure.
- All right.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.384
"My benevolence is upset
and so is my pride

20:21.846 --> 20:23.962
"That's why I took my bitch

20:24.265 --> 20:25.505
"for a ride

20:25.808 --> 20:29.392
"I'm down with the bros
and I'm up on my shiznit

20:29.812 --> 20:33.931
"because I love it when I'm just laid back
chilling with my bitch"

20:38.195 --> 20:39.902
"Whichever one of them hoes I'm with"

20:40.197 --> 20:43.155
I call it, <i>Love Can Be A Wonderful Thing.</i>

20:43.451 --> 20:45.112
Thank you, Anferny.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.946
That was quite romantic.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.158
Julie Rubels. Miss Rubels?

20:53.461 --> 20:55.998
That's Mrs. Rubels.

20:56.297 --> 20:58.834
See, right after I got out of prison,
I met Tito...

20:59.133 --> 21:01.420
and that's when little Juan and Maria
came along.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.385
I certainly hope
you learned a valuable lesson.

21:08.684 --> 21:09.799
Yes.

21:10.102 --> 21:14.391
Basically, as far as vasectomies go,
never use the home Kit.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.558
Thank you, Julie.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.311
Griff McReynolds?

21:22.531 --> 21:24.067
Where's Griff? Griff.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.277
We had the pleasure
of meeting earlier today.

21:26.577 --> 21:28.159
Hey, Griff, let me ask you something.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.446
Where do you see yourself in, say, 20 years?

21:32.249 --> 21:34.160
Living in your house, homes...

21:34.460 --> 21:36.417
with your cracker ass buried
under the front porch.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.304
Hi.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.965
Excuse me.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.055
Hi.

21:58.359 --> 22:02.023
- How was your first day?
- Not bad. Not bad at all.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.399
I think I may be reaching them.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.356
Victoria?

22:08.077 --> 22:09.693
Do you think
you could give me a ride home?

22:09.995 --> 22:12.532
I seem to have misplaced my car.

22:12.832 --> 22:17.121
Don't worry about it.
All the teachers lose their cars the first day.

22:17.795 --> 22:20.207
Of course I'll give you a ride.

22:20.673 --> 22:23.506
That is,
if you promise to help me chaperone...

22:23.801 --> 22:25.462
the Welcome Back dance tonight.

22:27.596 --> 22:28.757
Really?

22:30.766 --> 22:32.131
I'd love to.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.133
Great.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.262
So I'll meet you out in the parking lot
in five minutes?

22:37.565 --> 22:38.680
Okay.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.237
- Tripping, right?
- Right.

23:01.964 --> 23:05.252
All right, peep this out, y'all.
We going to pump it up a little bit like this.

23:05.551 --> 23:06.632
Yeah.

23:08.012 --> 23:11.004
Listen, I have a record I want you to play.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.723
Don't you think the kids would enjoy
a nice song with a melody?

23:15.019 --> 23:16.805
What you got, homes?

23:17.104 --> 23:20.096
It is a rare, one-of-a-kind, original pressing.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.482
Yeah? All right, man.
I'm going to put it on here for you.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.688
- Thanks.
- No problem.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.801
Yo, man, these jams be kicking, man.

23:51.096 --> 23:54.305
You got any more of this funky fresh shit
lying around the crib?

23:57.686 --> 23:59.848
- Hey.
- Hi.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.388
You're in my history class, right?

24:02.691 --> 24:04.978
- I'm Griff McReynolds.
- Natalie Thompson.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.939
That was a pretty nice poem
you read in class today, Natalie.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.195
- Thanks.
- How do you think of all that stuff?

24:10.491 --> 24:12.573
I try not to, you know?

24:12.868 --> 24:15.451
Is it true you used to run the gang
before Paco?

24:15.746 --> 24:18.408
Yeah, but I'm through with gangs. Word up.

24:18.707 --> 24:22.245
I mean, in juvie I had time to do
some thinking and some reading.

24:22.544 --> 24:25.127
You're different from everybody else here.

24:25.422 --> 24:28.585
Most of the boys I know,
they're all crude and immature.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.876
Most of the time,
they just want to stare at girls' breasts.

24:32.179 --> 24:34.511
- You know what I mean?
- Sorry. What?

24:35.432 --> 24:37.014
This is my song.

24:37.643 --> 24:40.681
- You want to bust one?
- I don't know. We just met.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.063
Come on. It's just an innocent little dance.

24:45.693 --> 24:46.774
Okay.

25:15.723 --> 25:16.804
Yeah.

25:30.446 --> 25:32.562
All right, boys, let's party.

25:33.157 --> 25:35.899
Yo, Mr. DeMarco in the house. Beat it.

25:40.581 --> 25:43.448
- Paco.
- What up?

25:44.168 --> 25:46.330
What's the 411 on my shipment?

25:46.628 --> 25:49.791
Same as always.
Mr. A's Restaurant, Friday nights.

25:50.090 --> 25:53.253
You bring the cash. We bring the boot.
You know the drill.

25:54.803 --> 25:56.760
You tell Mr. A to expect me.

25:58.515 --> 26:00.097
I'll do that.

26:00.642 --> 26:04.886
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got to go mingle with my customers.

26:05.189 --> 26:07.021
See, real money talks.

26:07.941 --> 26:09.932
Let's see if yours does.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.152
I mean, there was a time...

26:13.447 --> 26:17.111
when I tried all the self-help groups
like Outward Bound...

26:17.409 --> 26:21.619
and that other one where a bunch of men
sit around a campfire naked...

26:21.914 --> 26:23.951
beating drums and abusing themselves.

26:24.708 --> 26:28.542
Then I tried drugs.
Prozac, Zantac, Monoxodil.

26:28.837 --> 26:31.124
But in the end,
you know what I found worked for me?

26:31.423 --> 26:32.663
Dim sum.

26:32.966 --> 26:35.173
Whenever I'm feeling overwhelmed by life...

26:35.469 --> 26:37.335
I just head to Chinatown.

26:37.638 --> 26:41.848
Yo, Mr. Clark, Paco and his boys heading up
in here. You want us to serve them fools?

26:42.726 --> 26:46.185
Look. Anferny, instead of using your fists...

26:46.980 --> 26:48.345
try using this.

26:48.649 --> 26:50.060
Head-butting?

26:50.692 --> 26:53.525
Never mind.
Just pick a window and guard it.

26:53.821 --> 26:55.687
Richard,
you're not really going to try and stop...

26:55.989 --> 26:57.696
Paco and his gang from coming in, are you?

26:57.991 --> 27:00.278
- They come to all the dances.
- Not anymore.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.535
What if they got guns and knives
and everything?

27:03.831 --> 27:06.493
Who'd bring guns and knives to a dance?

27:09.419 --> 27:11.706
In that case,
maybe we'd better call the police.

27:12.005 --> 27:16.124
No, wait. The last time they tried that,
four people ended up in the hospital.

27:16.426 --> 27:19.760
I can see your point.
We can't have kids going to the hospital.

27:20.055 --> 27:23.423
Who said anything about kids?
The cops were beaten senseless.

27:25.018 --> 27:26.258
All right.

27:26.562 --> 27:30.226
You take care of the music. Anferny,
you and your guys, you come with me.

27:30.774 --> 27:31.809
Let's go.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.737
Say, nice leather jacket.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.898
- Men's Warehouse?
- Shut up, teach.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.693
We're coming in, so stand aside.

27:43.996 --> 27:47.409
Not this time, gentlemen.
This dance is for Barry students only.

27:47.708 --> 27:50.416
We're not gonna have any gangs
inside our school.

27:50.711 --> 27:53.078
- Who's gonna stop us?
- My gang.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.621
We already up inside the school.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.881
You call them bunch of pussies a gang?

27:58.177 --> 28:01.169
Look, Paco, if you're interested
in coming back to school...

28:01.471 --> 28:02.836
- and working towards a career--
- Shut up!

28:03.265 --> 28:05.097
Are you gonna move aside...

28:05.392 --> 28:07.724
or am I gonna have to turn your eyebrows
into a moustache?

28:08.020 --> 28:09.226
Paco...

28:11.023 --> 28:14.607
- why don't you chill out, man?
- Stay out of this, Griff.

28:14.902 --> 28:18.645
- Since when you been down with O.P.P?
- What you tripping about?

28:18.947 --> 28:21.905
- You with my girl.
- I am not your girl, Paco.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.738
- Since when?
- We went on one date.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.994
If I had known
you were gonna rob that liquor store...

28:27.289 --> 28:28.996
trust me, I never would have gone.

28:29.291 --> 28:30.452
No one got hurt, did they?

28:30.751 --> 28:33.493
Only 'cause the clerk was wearing
a bulletproof turban.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.581
All right, that's enough.

28:35.881 --> 28:38.122
Fine. I don't want you anyway,
you super freak.

28:38.425 --> 28:40.132
You're a real jack-off, you know that?

28:43.680 --> 28:45.671
That's enough. I mean it.

28:46.808 --> 28:48.924
We're all civilized human beings here.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.219
Certainly we can come up
with a compromise.

28:51.521 --> 28:54.309
All right. I just got some fresh wheels.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.356
How about a chickee run?

28:56.652 --> 29:00.361
- You're a real idiot, you know?
- That's good. Chickee run.

29:00.656 --> 29:02.112
Isn't that better than fighting?

29:02.407 --> 29:04.990
Okay, everybody, let's go. Back to dancing.

29:05.285 --> 29:08.994
- And we'll see you in, what?
- Ten minutes. Beck's Bluff.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.826
- See you at the Bluff.
- Thanks, pal.

29:12.376 --> 29:14.583
Chickee run.

29:17.256 --> 29:21.375
See? There's always an intelligent way
to solve our differences.

29:21.677 --> 29:25.045
My God, Richard, do you have any idea
what you've just done?

29:34.356 --> 29:35.846
Get lost, punk.

29:44.908 --> 29:46.273
All right.

29:46.785 --> 29:51.029
First one to jump out of the car
before the edge of the cliff loses.

29:51.665 --> 29:54.908
Now remember, no ramming, no swerving...

29:55.210 --> 29:58.043
and absolutely no use of brakes at any time.

29:58.338 --> 30:01.126
All right, listen up, guys. Here's the deal.

30:01.425 --> 30:03.382
When I drop this scarf...

30:03.844 --> 30:05.835
you boys are gonna go.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.799
No jumping the gun.

30:09.099 --> 30:10.339
Ready...

30:17.482 --> 30:18.517
set...

30:29.703 --> 30:30.693
Go!

30:48.722 --> 30:51.680
Richard, just promise me you'll be careful.

30:51.975 --> 30:54.387
Remember some things are irreplaceable.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.929
Irreplaceable?
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

31:00.776 --> 31:03.188
I was talking about my car!

31:12.746 --> 31:13.861
Hey.

31:17.959 --> 31:21.372
Griff. Paco. Listen to me, boys.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.662
Going fast never solved anything.

31:23.965 --> 31:26.252
This is no way to resolve a dispute.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.292
We can work this mess out.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.677
I want you both to get out of your cars
right now...

31:30.972 --> 31:33.555
and we'll settle this in an adult manner...

31:33.850 --> 31:35.466
like a fistfight.

31:42.317 --> 31:43.899
There. That's better.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.600
Nobody panic.

32:23.525 --> 32:25.107
I'm okay.

32:25.610 --> 32:29.023
Here's the tip.
Nobody has to know about this.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.697
Our little secret.

32:44.254 --> 32:46.962
<i>Firefighters from all over
Southern California...</i>

32:47.257 --> 32:51.467
<i>are still trying to contain the flames
that have blackened over 200 acres...</i>

32:51.761 --> 32:54.048
<i>and caused several blocks of homes
to be evacuated.</i>

32:54.848 --> 32:57.806
<i>The charred remains of three cars
were found in the rubble.</i>

32:58.101 --> 33:01.310
<i>One, a classic Corvette,
has been described by experts...</i>

33:01.605 --> 33:03.516
<i>as being irreplaceable.</i>

33:05.692 --> 33:08.480
I think we've heard enough bad news
for one day.

33:08.778 --> 33:10.485
What we've been hearing are rumors...

33:10.780 --> 33:14.273
that some of our students
may have been involved in this fire.

33:14.576 --> 33:16.738
And very possibly, a teacher.

33:18.163 --> 33:22.031
You wouldn't know anything about that,
would you, Mr. Clark?

33:22.876 --> 33:24.116
No.

33:24.419 --> 33:26.035
You know, Clark...

33:26.922 --> 33:30.540
I've been thinking
that maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

33:30.842 --> 33:33.459
I happen to be a woman
who has strong opinions...

33:33.762 --> 33:36.345
about how this place should be run.

33:36.640 --> 33:40.133
It's just possible
that you and I don't see eye-to-eye...

33:40.435 --> 33:42.767
on our philosophies of education.

33:43.480 --> 33:46.563
I've always been a woman of few words.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.142
No miracles.

33:49.444 --> 33:50.900
Dumping ground.

33:51.404 --> 33:54.066
I'll need more words than that, ma'am.

33:56.785 --> 33:59.322
All right. I'll spell it out for you.

33:59.996 --> 34:02.112
Our primary job here...

34:02.415 --> 34:06.909
is to warehouse these delinquents,
until such time as they can be released...

34:07.212 --> 34:09.373
into the general population...

34:09.672 --> 34:11.539
or sent to a real jail.

34:11.967 --> 34:16.427
Look, although I may admire
and even appreciate your ideals...

34:16.721 --> 34:18.928
I know what works, Mr. Clark.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.969
I know what to expect from these kids...

34:22.268 --> 34:24.851
and they know what to expect from me.

34:25.855 --> 34:29.940
My hope is that you can fit into the pattern
here at Barry.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.943
I guess I should get to class.

34:33.697 --> 34:36.234
I've certainly enjoyed our chat...

34:36.533 --> 34:39.696
and I'll take everything you've said to heart.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.860
Clark!

34:42.163 --> 34:43.527
Mr. Clark...

34:46.835 --> 34:48.667
Chickee run, man. Yeah.

34:48.962 --> 34:52.170
- Mr. Clark, you were smoking last night.
- Thanks, Anferny.

34:53.216 --> 34:54.377
My man!

34:56.803 --> 34:58.168
For you, Mr. Clark.

34:58.471 --> 35:00.838
Richard, you forgot your briefcase.

35:01.141 --> 35:04.133
How sweet. Is that for me?

35:04.853 --> 35:06.685
Sorry about your car.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.493
All right. I want everyone to take their...

35:27.792 --> 35:28.907
seats.

35:31.671 --> 35:34.083
Today, I'd like to talk about...

35:39.012 --> 35:42.050
All right. I guess I won't need this anymore.

35:46.102 --> 35:47.934
Let's begin, shall we?

35:48.480 --> 35:51.268
Yesterday,
I was about to start with the Bill of Rights...

35:51.566 --> 35:53.807
and what they mean to all of us.

35:54.110 --> 35:57.444
Who can tell me about the Founding Fathers
and their doctrine?

36:15.423 --> 36:16.913
Let me go, man.

36:17.384 --> 36:19.500
That's not funny. Let go.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.506
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

36:22.806 --> 36:25.924
<i>This is Principal Doyle
welcoming you once again...</i>

36:26.226 --> 36:28.467
<i>to Barry High's weekly Career Day.</i>

36:28.770 --> 36:31.353
<i>All the companies represented here
have been handpicked...</i>

36:31.648 --> 36:36.643
<i>by me in order to give you
a full spectrum of safe and legal ways...</i>

36:36.945 --> 36:40.859
What's up, man?
I see you got a bright future ahead of you.

36:41.700 --> 36:45.068
You wouldn't understand, Paco.
I'm trying to help my family.

36:45.370 --> 36:48.783
See now, this is the shit
that's going to feed your family, not some...

36:49.082 --> 36:50.493
rinky-dink job.

36:50.792 --> 36:53.159
Go ahead, man. I'm sure you could use it.

36:53.461 --> 36:57.045
I got a big deal going down, all right,
with DeMarco at Mr. A's Restaurant.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.752
- You remember the zip code, right?
- Yeah.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.667
I need a good mule.

37:01.970 --> 37:05.088
- Are you up for it?
- I can't even think about that right now.

37:05.390 --> 37:08.928
Who's asking you to think?
Ask Alonzo here. Thinking hurts.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.359
Richard?

37:20.947 --> 37:22.187
Hello?

37:49.934 --> 37:53.643
You tell your boyfriend this is only
the beginning. He better back off.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.269
Get your hands off of me!

37:55.565 --> 37:58.853
Come on, I know you want this.
I read Mike Tyson's book.

38:16.377 --> 38:19.711
Javier, come quick and bring your tools.

38:29.182 --> 38:31.514
Don't worry, Victoria, I'm here.

38:33.686 --> 38:35.427
Let me handle this.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.520
Here, put this on.

38:50.537 --> 38:51.743
Animal.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.829
Get off of her.

39:00.129 --> 39:01.665
Here, sit down.

39:51.264 --> 39:52.470
Victoria.

39:53.433 --> 39:55.299
No. Stay away from me.

39:56.102 --> 39:58.685
- It's okay. It's me.
- I know.

39:59.439 --> 40:01.771
What the hell's going on here?

40:02.066 --> 40:03.522
I was attacked.

40:03.985 --> 40:06.568
Dressed like that, what do you expect?

40:06.863 --> 40:08.399
And alone with him.

40:08.698 --> 40:10.689
It wasn't just me. There were three of us.

40:11.618 --> 40:13.074
That makes it all better.

40:13.369 --> 40:17.328
No. I was wrestling with the other guy.
He was trying to have sex with her.

40:17.624 --> 40:20.867
I don't care what your arrangement was,
or how it went wrong.

40:21.169 --> 40:22.830
Now you listen to me, Clark.

40:23.129 --> 40:25.996
Either you shape up,
or I'll bounce you out of here...

40:26.299 --> 40:28.381
faster than a homo at Fort Dix.

40:33.723 --> 40:36.215
- Does it hurt here?
- A little.

40:39.354 --> 40:40.594
And here?

40:43.441 --> 40:46.684
- How about here?
- I can't feel your hand.

40:47.862 --> 40:50.024
That's because I'm touching myself.

40:51.699 --> 40:54.987
I better get you something to wear.
You have a T-shirt around here anywhere?

40:55.286 --> 40:56.572
Top drawer.

41:04.212 --> 41:05.577
Here we are.

41:07.882 --> 41:10.294
Poor thing. You must be exhausted.

41:11.719 --> 41:14.711
Let me loosen that bra and get you some air.

41:16.099 --> 41:17.555
Richard...

41:18.059 --> 41:21.393
Victoria, I'm sorry about all this.
It's all my fault.

41:21.688 --> 41:25.181
If they think by attacking you
they can scare me off, they're nuts.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.942
They can attack you all they want.
I'm gonna get through to these kids.

41:29.237 --> 41:31.774
Sure, getting them to come to class,
it's a small victory...

41:32.073 --> 41:35.316
- but it isn't enough.
- Richard, they have to want to learn.

41:35.618 --> 41:38.701
That's exactly my point.
And I think Griff is the key.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.908
He seems to be a leader. Now...

41:41.708 --> 41:44.200
if I could just reach him,
I could get through to the others--

41:44.502 --> 41:46.368
You have to be careful.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.920
If you raise their expectations...

41:49.215 --> 41:52.207
their hopes, and their dreams,
and then you fail?

41:52.510 --> 41:54.217
It's worth the risk.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.128
These are all basically good kids.

41:56.431 --> 42:00.049
They deserve the same experiences
that we all had in high school.

42:00.351 --> 42:03.184
Dating, going to proms,
and begging for sex.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.891
Richard, you have to trust me on this one.

42:07.734 --> 42:09.020
I'm your friend.

42:11.195 --> 42:12.811
I'm more than a friend.

42:15.074 --> 42:16.360
To me?

42:17.618 --> 42:19.859
Yes. Why not?

42:20.830 --> 42:25.870
Well, no one who's ever looked like you
has ever looked at me.

42:27.128 --> 42:28.539
That's their loss.

42:33.426 --> 42:36.043
You know, I have never been very good
at relationships.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.214
In fact, most of mine always ended with,
you know:

42:41.517 --> 42:44.726
"Hey, what are you doing in bed
with that other woman?"

42:45.938 --> 42:47.645
And that was me talking.

42:51.027 --> 42:53.439
Victoria, I do find you very attractive.

43:00.620 --> 43:01.735
What's wrong?

43:02.622 --> 43:04.408
I'm scared.

43:06.334 --> 43:08.291
It's okay, you can be on top.

43:09.837 --> 43:11.293
No, it isn't that.

43:15.218 --> 43:17.334
Trouble just seems to follow me around.

43:17.637 --> 43:21.380
Everywhere I go, there's always someone
looking to bust my balls.

43:21.682 --> 43:23.264
Don't worry, Richard.

43:24.227 --> 43:26.013
Your balls are safe with me.

43:35.696 --> 43:38.438
My God, you're a virgin.

43:38.741 --> 43:40.948
No, I still have my panties on.

43:45.540 --> 43:49.283
- I still can't...
- Richard, I'm over here.

44:07.979 --> 44:10.016
Driver, I'm the next stop.

44:11.023 --> 44:13.981
Forget it, pal.
We don't stop in this neighborhood.

44:28.749 --> 44:29.705
<i>Griff?</i>

44:34.797 --> 44:36.913
- Here you go, darling.
- Thanks, Sam.

44:38.301 --> 44:39.883
Watch your back.

44:43.514 --> 44:45.175
Here's your cola, Griff.

44:49.687 --> 44:52.554
- Griff.
- Mr. Clark.

44:55.109 --> 44:58.192
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.

44:58.821 --> 45:02.280
I realize a lot of these men do,
but you can get help for this, son.

45:02.575 --> 45:06.068
No. I mean my mom and I
live in an apartment upstairs.

45:07.079 --> 45:11.323
Listen, Griff.
The reason I came here is because I--

45:12.335 --> 45:15.828
I sense that you want to make something
of yourself...

45:16.130 --> 45:18.997
and if you help me,
we can turn the school around.

45:19.300 --> 45:21.507
Why me, man?
You'll have to get somebody else.

45:21.802 --> 45:23.133
Who do you think is watching my little...

45:23.429 --> 45:25.966
brothers and sisters
while my moms is working? I'm all they got.

45:26.265 --> 45:28.552
You remind me a lot of myself
when I was your age...

45:28.851 --> 45:31.889
except I was white and had
both parents and lived in the suburbs...

45:32.188 --> 45:34.646
and I didn't have any brothers or sisters.

45:35.608 --> 45:37.849
Maybe you remind me of somebody else.

45:38.945 --> 45:41.653
Griff, don't you have a dream?

45:42.698 --> 45:46.737
- You wouldn't be interested, man.
- Sure I would. Tell me.

45:49.038 --> 45:52.372
- Promise you won't tell anyone.
- You have my word.

45:56.170 --> 45:59.583
- I want to go to college.
- College? You got to be...

46:01.092 --> 46:03.800
I'm sorry. Listen, Griff, I'll make you a deal.

46:04.095 --> 46:06.553
You help me get these kids to learn...

46:06.847 --> 46:11.091
and I promise you, I will do everything
in my power to get you into college.

46:11.394 --> 46:13.431
Don't try to play me, Mr. Clark.

46:13.729 --> 46:16.642
I've been promised stuff before
that hasn't come true.

46:16.941 --> 46:20.104
I'm saying, where would I get the money
for college from?

46:20.403 --> 46:22.986
- You ever hear of scholarships?
- Yeah!

46:23.281 --> 46:24.521
Well...

46:25.533 --> 46:27.570
you probably won't get any of those.

46:27.868 --> 46:30.656
But there are plenty of other ways.
I promise you.

46:30.955 --> 46:32.445
Don't just take my word for it, all right?

46:32.748 --> 46:34.739
You go home, you talk it over
with your mother.

46:35.042 --> 46:36.328
I'm sure she'll agree with me.

46:37.628 --> 46:38.618
Here.

46:40.506 --> 46:44.591
Listen, Griff,
you don't have to live in a community...

46:44.885 --> 46:48.048
infested with crimes, and drugs, and gangs.

46:48.723 --> 46:52.887
You don't have to end up in some sleazy bar
with a bunch of washed-up bums...

46:53.185 --> 46:55.768
watching some over-the-hill stripper
expose herself...

46:56.063 --> 46:58.521
for a few measly dollars in her G-string.

47:15.666 --> 47:18.499
Okay. Now, in the next six weeks...

47:18.794 --> 47:23.209
I am gonna try and cram as much knowledge
into your brains as is humanly possible.

47:26.302 --> 47:27.884
Or as space will allow.

47:28.679 --> 47:31.216
Now, this is your textbook for the semester.

47:34.643 --> 47:36.725
They open like this.

47:40.941 --> 47:42.557
Now all of you try it.

48:13.974 --> 48:15.135
Good.

48:16.268 --> 48:18.179
All right. Let's get to work.

48:18.479 --> 48:20.641
Maybe we should start
with some basic English.

48:20.940 --> 48:23.147
Now, who can give me a complete sentence?

48:23.442 --> 48:26.651
Yo, you wack punk,
you be going down the hard way.

48:26.946 --> 48:29.358
All right, that's a good sentence.
Let's examine it.

48:29.657 --> 48:33.150
"Yo" is a common colloquial greeting...

48:33.452 --> 48:34.317
comma...

48:34.620 --> 48:38.204
"you wack punk...

48:38.499 --> 48:41.366
"you be going..."

48:41.669 --> 48:45.003
This is just bad syntax.
Who can give me another sentence?

48:45.756 --> 48:48.373
- Julie.
- I think my water broke.

48:48.676 --> 48:49.757
Good.

48:50.052 --> 48:52.134
"I think..."

49:02.940 --> 49:04.977
- What's the capital of Nebraska?
- Lincoln.

49:05.276 --> 49:07.267
- Right. Who freed the slaves?
- Lincoln.

49:07.570 --> 49:10.278
Right. Charles Keating cooked the books
of what S and L?

49:10.573 --> 49:11.813
- Lincoln.
- Yes.

49:12.116 --> 49:14.403
- Who makes the best town car?
- Cadillac.

49:15.578 --> 49:16.534
No.

49:17.872 --> 49:20.364
- Lincoln!
- Amazing.

49:20.666 --> 49:22.452
Now we're getting somewhere.

49:32.261 --> 49:34.969
You and three of your G's
are on someone else's turf.

49:35.264 --> 49:38.473
You're cruising along in your fly ride
about 20 miles per.

49:38.767 --> 49:42.226
There's a posse of eight homies just sitting
in front of their crib, they're just...

49:42.521 --> 49:44.432
chilling on the porch
playing some fresh jams.

49:44.732 --> 49:47.474
- Who they got on the box?
- I think they're riffing with Tag Team...

49:47.776 --> 49:50.609
maybe some Ice, Snoop, Biggie,
Junior MAFIA, whatever.

49:50.905 --> 49:53.237
They decide that they want to throw down.

49:53.532 --> 49:56.866
So, you and your boys, you pile out
of your hooptie for the face-off.

49:57.161 --> 50:01.200
They have six baseball bats and two chains.

50:01.499 --> 50:03.490
You have three brass knuckles...

50:03.792 --> 50:06.705
and two sawed-off pool cues,
you know, jimmy sticks.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.666
Now, what I want to know is
what is the ratio...

50:09.965 --> 50:12.297
of metal weapons to wooden ones?

50:18.307 --> 50:21.174
Over here, over here, Mr. Clark, Julie knows.

50:46.460 --> 50:49.919
Okay, pop quiz. Who was the first president
to use the telephone?

50:50.214 --> 50:51.295
- Anferny.
- Nixon.

50:51.590 --> 50:52.455
No. Griff.

50:52.758 --> 50:53.589
- Garfield.
- Yes.

50:53.884 --> 50:55.045
First president to be on television?

50:55.344 --> 50:56.334
Anferny.

50:56.637 --> 50:59.220
- Johnny Carson.
- No, he was never president. Natalie.

50:59.515 --> 51:00.846
- Eisenhower.
- Yes.

51:01.141 --> 51:04.054
Who was the last president to blow chunks
on a Japanese head of state?

51:04.353 --> 51:05.343
Anferny.

51:05.646 --> 51:06.852
- Bush?
- Yes!

51:15.531 --> 51:16.987
Good day, Ms. Doyle.

51:22.329 --> 51:23.990
Good morning, Ms. Doyle.

51:28.419 --> 51:30.285
You looking fine, Ms. Doyle.

51:51.900 --> 51:54.767
Mr. Arnott? Where have you been?

51:55.070 --> 51:57.482
They released me.

52:03.245 --> 52:04.406
Everyone...

52:04.705 --> 52:08.824
state law prohibits Mr. Clark
from being here today, so he's at home...

52:09.251 --> 52:12.664
probably a little nervous,
but I'm sure rooting for all of you.

52:12.963 --> 52:14.374
All right, here we go.

52:14.882 --> 52:17.123
The Academic Proficiency Test.

52:17.426 --> 52:21.590
You have eight hours in which to complete
this exam. Good luck to all of you.

52:22.056 --> 52:24.218
Begin work now.

52:32.149 --> 52:35.232
<i>Every day people are discovering
Just how fun and easy it is...</i>

52:35.527 --> 52:38.235
<i>to get a precision-layered haircut
with the incredible...</i>

52:38.530 --> 52:40.692
<i>Flowbee Precision Haircufting System.</i>

52:40.991 --> 52:42.823
<i>Don't be fooled by imitators.</i>

52:50.626 --> 52:53.368
<i>Flowbee cuts from
a half-inch to six inches long.</i>

53:04.640 --> 53:06.631
<i>Can't do it wrong.
Get a close-up on this. Squeeze.</i>

53:06.934 --> 53:08.925
<i>Go ahead. Show your abs.</i>

53:28.997 --> 53:30.078
Shit.

53:52.730 --> 53:54.721
All right, time's up.

53:55.566 --> 53:58.024
Come on. Time's up. Close your booklets.

53:58.569 --> 54:00.936
I'm sure you all did very well.

54:01.238 --> 54:03.730
Scores will be posted
at the end of this week.

54:09.538 --> 54:11.825
How do you think you did on the test?

54:12.124 --> 54:15.583
I don't know. For the first time in my life,
I feel like I did something right.

54:15.878 --> 54:16.743
Me, too.

54:17.045 --> 54:19.286
- Check this out.
- What is it?

54:19.590 --> 54:22.582
It's my future. Remember that college
I was telling you about?

54:22.885 --> 54:24.671
- Yeah.
- They wrote me back yesterday.

54:24.970 --> 54:28.008
- Yeah.
- Now I feel like I got a real chance to get in.

54:28.724 --> 54:30.931
Guess I owe a lot to Mr. Clark?

54:31.226 --> 54:34.435
Yeah, you know, I think all the kids
pretty much feel the same way.

54:34.730 --> 54:36.266
I mean, think about it.

54:36.565 --> 54:39.557
We could both end up
at the same school together.

54:39.860 --> 54:43.603
Griff, this is the happiest
I ever remember being.

54:43.906 --> 54:47.115
It's the first time in my life I haven't prayed
for a gas line to rupture...

54:47.409 --> 54:49.400
under my building while I was smoking.

54:49.703 --> 54:52.491
Natalie, I'm glad you're happy.

54:53.373 --> 54:55.580
Come on.
There's something I want you to see.

54:55.876 --> 54:56.741
Okay.

54:57.044 --> 55:00.127
Mr. Clark has taken this place on
as a special project.

55:01.423 --> 55:03.209
"Fie, my lord, fie!

55:04.051 --> 55:07.169
"Out, damned spot. Out, I say."

55:08.430 --> 55:09.465
Line!

55:09.765 --> 55:11.927
"Who would have thought the old man
to have so much blood?"

55:12.226 --> 55:15.935
"Who would have thought the old man
to have so much blood in him?"

55:21.527 --> 55:23.234
Take it off!

55:29.201 --> 55:31.738
Hustle up, man. Come on, hurry up.

55:34.164 --> 55:35.654
Yeah, sweet.

55:37.876 --> 55:40.038
This ought to take care of our little problem.

55:40.337 --> 55:42.044
Let's get out of here, Paco.

55:52.641 --> 55:54.097
Hey, give it a rest.

55:54.768 --> 55:58.306
Everyone, I just want to say
before the test scores arrive...

55:59.189 --> 56:03.228
that I am so proud of all of you.

56:11.618 --> 56:12.653
Well?

56:13.287 --> 56:16.496
As I expected,
every student in this class failed.

56:17.541 --> 56:20.374
The lowest scores in the country.

56:21.920 --> 56:24.753
- But there must be some mistake.
- That's right.

56:25.048 --> 56:29.167
And you're it. See for yourself.
Figures don't lie.

56:30.053 --> 56:32.886
We're not dealing
with Rhodes scholars here.

56:33.640 --> 56:37.008
It's time I just accepted what I am
and get on with my life.

56:38.854 --> 56:40.265
No, Griff, wait.

56:41.857 --> 56:43.063
See what you've done?

56:44.401 --> 56:47.769
I told you to leave them at the bottom
of the barrel, where they belong.

56:48.071 --> 56:49.232
Griff, wait.

56:50.782 --> 56:53.615
Consider yourself terminated
as of right now.

56:53.911 --> 56:55.151
Natalie, wait.

56:55.746 --> 56:57.407
Chuckie, wait.

56:59.291 --> 57:02.283
Wait, Ms. Doyle,
you're making a huge mistake.

57:02.586 --> 57:05.328
Mr. Clark has helped this school.
He's a good teacher.

57:05.631 --> 57:08.669
And I'm not just saying that
because we slept together.

57:11.219 --> 57:13.711
Clean out your desk by the end of the day.

57:26.193 --> 57:28.275
- Richard, wait.
- No.

57:29.196 --> 57:30.857
You were right all along.

57:31.406 --> 57:34.569
I didn't know what I was getting into
with these kids.

57:36.328 --> 57:37.534
Richard.

57:41.124 --> 57:42.410
I'm out of here.

57:43.335 --> 57:45.201
What's wrong with all of you?

57:45.504 --> 57:48.292
Have you forgotten
how much Mr. Clark has helped us?

57:48.590 --> 57:52.128
You had a D average
before Mr. Clark started tutoring you.

57:52.427 --> 57:54.543
Now you're on the honor roll.

57:54.846 --> 57:58.339
And this boy. Everyone thought he had
Tourette's syndrome until Mr. Clark...

57:58.642 --> 58:01.179
discovered he was
a Hindu exchange student.

58:22.249 --> 58:23.614
You suck!

58:26.503 --> 58:29.666
You can come back.
Look at me. I'm living proof.

58:32.009 --> 58:34.125
Call me.

58:35.846 --> 58:38.133
Richard, wait!

58:38.682 --> 58:39.888
Richard.

58:50.944 --> 58:53.106
I'm telling you,
I'm really worried about Richard.

58:53.405 --> 58:55.396
I've been calling his house
for the past three days...

58:55.699 --> 58:56.905
and I keep getting the same message:

58:57.200 --> 58:59.612
"Hi. I'm not here, and I may never be again."

58:59.911 --> 59:00.867
Julie?

59:02.164 --> 59:05.031
Buddy up with a mangy dog
or a small child.

59:05.333 --> 59:07.574
Hey, Nat, are you okay?

59:07.878 --> 59:12.088
- I'm afraid Griff's gonna join Paco's gang.
- Come on.

59:12.382 --> 59:13.668
Check this out.

59:13.967 --> 59:18.177
Word on the street is Paco and his little
punk dogs slipped those mentals we took.

59:19.514 --> 59:23.178
What I'm saying is, they switched the tests.
That's why everybody flunked.

59:23.477 --> 59:26.515
You know, you guys.
I probably didn't need no help.

59:26.813 --> 59:30.431
- Oh, my God, this is awful.
- Then we just got to find Mr. Clark.

59:30.734 --> 59:34.102
Yeah, but where?
Where do you find a man that depressed?

59:34.738 --> 59:37.275
Wait a minute. Dim sum.

59:37.783 --> 59:39.740
Chinatown. Come on.

59:44.498 --> 59:47.832
Okay, this is it. Julie, Natalie...

59:48.585 --> 59:50.701
- why don't you two head down that way?
- Okay.

59:51.004 --> 59:54.042
Anferny, go down to the south end
of the block, and I'll go down this way.

59:54.341 --> 59:55.547
All right.

59:59.513 --> 01:00:01.220
Please, let this be the one.

01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:28.204
Richard,
what are you trying to do to yourself?

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.208
Richard, snap out of it.
Don't you recognize me?

01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:32.997
Mum?

01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:35.379
No, it's me.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:41.919
Father O' Flannery?

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:55.228
Mister?

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:59.316
You okay? Mister, you okay?

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.653
This girl over there, she asked about you.
Come. Now.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.323
- Richard, thank God.
- Victoria?

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:09.955
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I didn't know you drank.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:11.956
I drank?

01:01:12.878 --> 01:01:15.119
I thought it was just my pet gorilla here.

01:01:16.464 --> 01:01:18.171
How many fingers?

01:01:20.802 --> 01:01:24.887
Come on, Mr. Clark, snap out of it.
We got to get Griff out of that drug deal.

01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:28.136
Maybe we should just
let the cops handle this.

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:32.224
That would be fine if I didn't mind waiting
20 years to see Griff again.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.763
Don't worry. I'll just go in and get him.

01:01:35.066 --> 01:01:37.182
Mr. Clark, you can't just go in there
and be like:

01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:42.446
"Okay, Griff, we're going home,"
else you gonna be going home in a box.

01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:44.607
The only way we're going to get Griff
out of there...

01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:47.117
is you got to show up in the back room
with the cash.

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:49.369
You got the cash, you the man.

01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:52.952
- Where am I gonna get the cash?
- Man, DeMarco gonna be there.

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:55.959
What you think he carry in his briefcase?
Food stamps?

01:01:56.254 --> 01:01:59.622
Your job is to make his cash your cash.

01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:10.382
- Did you get it?
- It's all in there.

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:15.353
Good.

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:18.057
We just got time to eat.

01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:23.274
All right, everybody, wait here.

01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:28.443
- <i>I'll</i> handle this.
- You not out in 20 minutes...

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:31.237
me and my G's is coming in after you,
straight up.

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:35.199
Go in there and represent, Mr. Clark.
You can do it.

01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:37.997
I can do this.

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:44.128
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to help you.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:47.169
Richard, if anything happens,
I want to be here with you.

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:49.175
Thanks.

01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:54.100
How are we gonna know
which one is DeMarco?

01:02:54.396 --> 01:02:58.014
- We'll just take a wild guess.
- Where?

01:02:58.316 --> 01:02:59.852
Come on.

01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:09.241
<i>- Someday you will be the world's leaders.
- You suck!</i>

01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:13.950
Where you going?

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.412
It's a mistake, man. I can't do this.

01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:22.045
I thought we settled this, Griffy-boy.

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:25.503
You better decide right now. You in or out?

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:28.711
- I ain't asking again.
- Define "in or out."

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:33.261
In, you're with us, and out, you're dead.

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:36.180
Works for me.

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:46.612
Where the hell's our waiter?

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:48.814
Good evening, gentlemen...

01:03:49.534 --> 01:03:52.322
and welcome to Mr. A's
fine dining establishment.

01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:57.782
I'm Zack. I'll be your waiter this evening,
and this is my trainee, Paula.

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:01.456
I'm an Aries.
I enjoy water sports and dancing.

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:04.042
- And my hobbies are origami--
- Enough small talk.

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:06.127
Just bring us two thick T-bones.

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:08.212
Yes, sir.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:12.049
Would you like those
with or without the bones?

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:17.434
And a couple of glasses of water.

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:20.596
All right.
Let me tell you about our water then.

01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:23.607
It comes from the Los Angeles aqueduct...

01:04:23.902 --> 01:04:26.860
where it flows down
a lovely cement channel on a bed of--

01:04:27.155 --> 01:04:31.023
I don't care where it came from.
Just bring it to us.

01:04:31.326 --> 01:04:32.942
I'll take that. It's his birthday.

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:35.406
Would anyone care
for some desserts this evening?

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:38.823
Look, you little weasel.
Just bring us what we asked for.

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:42.459
Unless you want me to stick
this bread stick up your ass.

01:04:42.754 --> 01:04:44.586
It sure would taste better if you didn't.

01:04:46.341 --> 01:04:48.503
You might want to try buttering it first.

01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:03.892
Hey, stand back.

01:05:04.192 --> 01:05:07.025
Come on. We've got to change disguises.

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:18.862
You ready?

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:23.826
Yeah, but unfortunately
we've got this other thing we gotta do first.

01:05:24.379 --> 01:05:26.211
Let's see what's in this thing.

01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:27.712
Jesus!

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:29.665
Hurry.

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:34.795
Manny, zap that sauce for me, will you?

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:36.888
Got it.

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:49.477
Now, what do you want?

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:54.902
I'm here to see Mr. A.

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:56.612
Who the hell are you?

01:05:57.328 --> 01:06:00.446
I'm Mr. B.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:06.661
Mr. D couldn't make it. He's out with Mr. C.

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:11.085
You're early.

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:27.598
DeMarco's early.

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:30.359
Say what? You?

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:35.022
Mr. Clark, Miss Chapell,
what are you doing here?

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:38.150
No need to be so formal, boys.

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:40.694
We're not in school anymore.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:44.740
Two seconds you gonna be
one dead teacher. How's that for formal?

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:48.077
Now, we work for DeMarco,
buying and selling drugs.

01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:51.087
We're lowlife scumbags. Just like you.

01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:55.168
- What are you talking about?
- What better cover than...

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:57.211
a teacher and a secretary?

01:06:57.639 --> 01:06:59.471
Administrative assistant.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.261
Yes, all right.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:06.804
All right, enough of this small talk.
I've got business with Mr. A. Where is he?

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:08.267
I'm right here.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:14.232
- Clark?
- Ms. Doyle?

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:17.147
Around here they call me Mr. A.

01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:18.607
Mister?

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:21.493
I inherited the business
from my late husband.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.663
- I'm shocked.
- What?

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:27.165
That a woman can run a business?

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.622
No. That you were ever married.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:34.710
All right. Let's do it.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:37.926
What exactly is she doing here?

01:07:39.013 --> 01:07:40.549
She's my bitch.

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:48.391
Well, my significant other.

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:51.557
We've been slapping skins
for quite some time now.

01:07:53.111 --> 01:07:56.399
You say you work for DeMarco.
Why should I believe you?

01:07:56.698 --> 01:07:59.611
Why would I have his briefcase
unless I was working for him?

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.695
That doesn't prove anything.

01:08:02.203 --> 01:08:04.444
You could have seen him
down in the restaurant...

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:08.115
dressed up like a waiter,
created some kind of diversion...

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:10.910
while she snatched it from under the table.

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:14.580
That's a little far-fetched, don't you think?

01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:18.876
Wait a minute. Think about it.
You think he's capable of all that?

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:22.045
Hey, all right.

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:24.214
What's the big idea?

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:27.600
- You work out?
- All right. Knock it off.

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:34.108
I say we off him now,
and then do what we want with their bodies.

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.643
Easy, Paco, easy.

01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:40.526
So, you like getting high, Clark?

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:43.066
Who doesn't?

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:46.828
Then perhaps you'd like to sample
the finest crank in town.

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:51.787
Sure. Load me up a spike.
Let's get this party into gear.

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:58.089
- Look man, he's clean. No tracks.
- I take mine In the ass.

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:06.430
Got used to it as a kid. Shots.

01:09:08.019 --> 01:09:10.010
You're starting to piss me off, man.

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:12.850
Maybe you don't have enough holes
in your head already.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:16.483
Excuse me.
Something seems to be riding up here.

01:09:19.697 --> 01:09:21.062
What's going on there?

01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:23.903
Nothing I know rides up that high.

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.033
Here.

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:29.033
Tie off.

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:41.379
You really should have someone
look at that. It could be malignant.

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:44.636
Quit stalling.
We don't want to be here all night.

01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:48.014
Here's looking at you, kid.

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:08.235
This shit be kicking.

01:10:09.288 --> 01:10:12.826
Man, I'm wasted off my ass
and you're still ugly.

01:10:26.848 --> 01:10:28.009
False alarm.

01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:31.721
Some idiot put a gun in the microwave.

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:34.393
Good stuff?

01:10:36.107 --> 01:10:38.394
So what have you got to say for yourself?

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:40.024
Nothing, really.

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:44.563
Except it's going to be an interesting
morning tomorrow, after my coffee.

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:47.695
I'll need at least two magazines.

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:53.705
- So it's all here?
- As far as you know.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.037
- Half a million?
- Really?

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:58.535
Yes, down to the penny.

01:10:59.005 --> 01:11:02.214
Now, I'll just take my stuff
and be on my way.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:04.541
Wait here.

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:20.481
Griff, you got to get out of here.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:23.610
You're throwing your life away,
messing around with these drug dealers.

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:26.363
- Look who's talking.
- No, he's not a real drug dealer.

01:11:26.657 --> 01:11:29.069
He's just pretending. He's here to save you.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:32.995
- You risked your life to come here for me?
- Yeah, of course I did.

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:35.246
Well, not the risking-my-life part.

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:40.081
Anyway, look, Paco switched the tests, and
the police are probably already on their way.

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:42.040
We got to get out before--

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:48.214
- It's the waiter and his trainee.
- Yeah. Where the hell's our dinner?

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:52.472
You jughead.
They're the ones who stole our briefcase.

01:11:52.767 --> 01:11:54.633
DeMarco, what's going on?

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:57.394
Is this your idea of a straight deal?

01:11:59.106 --> 01:12:03.395
- We thought Clark was your guy.
- I never seen him before tonight.

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:12.034
Hey. Another one of these,
one of us is gonna have an orgasm.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:16.697
Clark, you never should have messed
with me. I don't want him found.

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.489
No problem.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:30.710
No.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:34.924
- Come on, G's. They're down this way.
- You guys.

01:12:35.226 --> 01:12:36.341
In the house.

01:12:43.484 --> 01:12:46.272
Doyle is getting away. Stop her.

01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:51.564
Seems to me
we've got some unfinished business.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.825
You're forgetting a couple things,
aren't you?

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.909
- Yeah, what's that?
- Richard's not here to help you this time.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:12:59.322
And?

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:01.582
I have a frozen pig's foot.

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:51.879
What's he doing?

01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:56.929
What's going on?

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:58.673
Come on!

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:03.140
Look! There's a bigger man,
and he's got a gun!

01:14:31.342 --> 01:14:33.379
- Christ!
- Sorry.

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:39.548
This was a new suit, pickle dick.

01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:51.400
Get back.

01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:56.572
What are you fossils staring at?
Eat your vegetables.

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:11.125
Get back! I'm gonna walk out of here.
You punks get out of the way.

01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:15.550
I'm gonna count to three, and if you're
not moving, I'm gonna start shooting.

01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:17.210
Do what she says, kids.

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:20.631
Chill, Mr. Clark.
She ain't shooting nothing but the breeze.

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:24.301
You kids are even bigger boneheads
than I thought.

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:27.561
And everybody knows it, too,
except for this fool.

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:30.982
You know, Ms. Doyle, that's just what you...

01:15:31.277 --> 01:15:33.894
and people like you,
want everyone to think, isn't it?

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:37.734
That somehow, no matter what goes down,
we just can't cut it.

01:15:38.409 --> 01:15:40.901
You use that as an excuse to hold us back...

01:15:41.662 --> 01:15:45.405
but Mr. Clark showed us
that there is another way.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.324
Another way to flunk.

01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:50.368
Think we failed that test? Listen up.

01:15:50.671 --> 01:15:55.006
If x is 17?, plus the square root of 4,
minus 6...

01:15:55.426 --> 01:15:56.541
what's X?

01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:58.126
Thirteen.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:01.717
Famous Russian author of
The Brothers Karamazov?

01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:03.302
Who is Dostoyevsky.

01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:06.093
The Gadsden Purchase formed parts
of what two states?

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.352
Arizona and New Mexico.

01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:09.853
All right, I'll shoot him.

01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:12.015
- What's the capital of Ecuador?
- Quito!

01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:13.479
Back off! I mean it.

01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:17.066
- NASA's Apollo Program ended what year?
- 1975!

01:16:17.364 --> 01:16:18.229
Stay away from me.

01:16:18.532 --> 01:16:20.773
Who was responsible
for the first moonwalk?

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:22.317
Michael Jackson!

01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:25.661
What did he say?

01:16:27.124 --> 01:16:30.958
No, I'm just playing, man.
It was Louis Armstrong's brother, Neil.

01:16:31.378 --> 01:16:32.288
What group...

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:36.422
is responsible for the consumption
of the most doughnuts in Los Angeles?

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:37.707
- Police!
- Right.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:39.876
Nobody move. Get your hands up.

01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:42.170
This isn't what it looks like.

01:16:42.473 --> 01:16:43.929
Say hello to Mr. A.

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:46.967
So this is Mr. A.
We've been looking for him for years.

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.634
You're under arrest, fellow.

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:51.976
Hey, partner, there's about five more
gangster-pops in the freezer.

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:55.145
It was her, man.
She masterminded the whole thing.

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:58.527
- <i>I'll</i> testify in court. She's Mr. A.
- We know.

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:02.030
Could I borrow your coat?
I can't feel my legs.

01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:04.784
Come on, let me go, man.
I'll give you $50,000.

01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:08.447
Ms. Doyle,
I guess we just got off on the wrong foot.

01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:10.080
No hard feelings.

01:17:12.419 --> 01:17:13.750
Wonderbra?

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:18.795
I swear to God, Clark,
when I get out, I'm gonna hunt you down...

01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:20.834
and beat you like a circus monkey.

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:23.094
By the way, happy birthday.

01:17:40.614 --> 01:17:42.821
This shit be kicking.

01:17:46.036 --> 01:17:48.448
<i>And now, to present the diplomas...</i>

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:51.364
<i>principal pro tem, Richard C. Clark.</i>

01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:54.041
<i>Will the graduates please rise and begin...</i>

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:57.203
Richard, I never thought I'd say this...

01:17:57.882 --> 01:18:00.089
but I was wrong about you, son.

01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:02.671
I can't believe
what you've accomplished here.

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:06.754
Thanks, Dad.

01:18:11.812 --> 01:18:15.521
When I call your name,
please step forward to receive your diploma.

01:18:16.442 --> 01:18:18.649
<i>Anferny Jefferson.</i>

01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:28.113

<i>Griff McReynolds.</i>

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:00.099
You did it, buddy.

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:02.518
<i>Way to go, Griff. That's my boy!</i>

01:19:04.782 --> 01:19:06.147
That's my boy.

01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:12.119
<i>Good for you, Griff!</i>

01:19:17.294 --> 01:19:20.662
<i>For all of you who did not
make the journey to this stage today...</i>

01:19:20.965 --> 01:19:23.798
<i>I say to you, work as hard as you can...</i>

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:26.710
<i>do a couple hours
of homework each night...</i>

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:29.925
<i>and nothing can stop you.</i>

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:46.984
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:49.565
<i>Graduates, graduate!</i>

01:20:41.628 --> 01:20:43.494
<i>Coming up on the 11:00 report...</i>

01:20:43.797 --> 01:20:47.256
<i>Sparky the rottweiler is still missing

01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:48.837
<i>day 32.</i>

01:20:49.136 --> 01:20:52.003
<i>A deadly strain of bacteria
found in movie popcorn...</i>

01:20:52.306 --> 01:20:56.675
<i>striking its victims exactly
one-and-a-half hours after being consumed.</i>

01:20:56.977 --> 01:20:58.138
<i>And in sports...</i>

01:20:58.437 --> 01:21:02.726
<i>Steve's gonna tell us about Marge Schott's
