00:04.726 --> 00:06.511
[Noah] Previously on The Affair...

00:06.512 --> 00:08.511
Author of the best-selling
novel, Descent,

00:08.512 --> 00:11.135
soon to be made into a
major motion picture,

00:11.136 --> 00:12.761
Noah Solloway.

00:12.762 --> 00:14.761
People know my movies, and
they see me as this, um,

00:14.762 --> 00:16.511
you know, this action hero,

00:16.512 --> 00:18.506
this sort of modern-day James Bond.

00:18.507 --> 00:19.719
But that's all an act, of course.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.665
I mean, that's not who I am.

00:21.666 --> 00:23.653
But this book, this is me.

00:23.654 --> 00:26.153
So what's your plan to make money?

00:26.154 --> 00:27.848
Ugh, I don't know.

00:27.849 --> 00:31.081
His visa's about to expire,
so no one will hire him.

00:31.082 --> 00:33.464
I just wanted to say I
think it's so awesome

00:33.465 --> 00:35.105
that you're my dad's girlfriend.

00:36.293 --> 00:37.511
Can I trouble you for another drink?

00:37.512 --> 00:40.135
[scoffs] Of course. Coming right up.

00:40.136 --> 00:41.886
[Noah] There's something wrong with him.

00:41.887 --> 00:44.037
He's losing his memory. He thinks
I'm still married to Helen.

00:44.038 --> 00:45.317
He thinks I own this place.

00:45.318 --> 00:47.220
[exhales] I need to leave.

00:49.345 --> 00:50.470
Come in.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.302
Vik, this is your son.

00:54.303 --> 00:56.094
This is Eddie.

00:56.095 --> 00:57.844
[Eddie coos softly]

00:57.845 --> 00:59.094
Are you with the studio?

00:59.095 --> 01:00.427
[scoffs] No.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.640
S-So you're...

01:01.641 --> 01:02.803
Helen.

01:02.804 --> 01:05.260
I lost my partner a few
months ago. [crying]

01:05.260 --> 01:07.052
Oh, my God.

01:07.053 --> 01:08.618
Just breathe.

01:08.619 --> 01:10.979
- I lost someone, too.
- [Paul] Where are you gonna stay?

01:10.980 --> 01:12.010
Dad's place.

01:12.011 --> 01:14.011

- [school bell ringing]

02:36.720 --> 02:38.750
[Petra] The early reviews
are really good.

02:39.970 --> 02:41.469
[Noah] So I hear. I, uh,

02:41.470 --> 02:43.497
I try not to pay attention
to those things.

02:44.303 --> 02:46.844
I have to admit, I wasn't
such a fan of Descent,

02:46.845 --> 02:48.928
although, clearly, the
book didn't suffer

02:48.929 --> 02:51.177
from lack of fans, but...

02:51.178 --> 02:53.135
The Autobiography of Jack Hunter,

02:53.136 --> 02:55.075
it really moved me.

02:55.076 --> 02:59.302
It's a much more vulnerable,
mature piece of writing.

02:59.303 --> 03:00.980
Thanks.

03:00.981 --> 03:04.064
I mean, I... I wrote it in prison

03:04.065 --> 03:06.386
partly just to, uh, keep
myself from going insane.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.302
So just to get it published
at all is gratifying, and...

03:08.303 --> 03:11.509
You were in prison for killing
your brother-in-law, right?

03:12.389 --> 03:15.302
Uh, my, uh, ex-wife's
brother-in-law, yeah.

03:15.989 --> 03:17.669
But there's plenty of stuff
out there about that.

03:17.670 --> 03:18.842
I-I really don't want to

03:18.843 --> 03:20.761
- make this about...
- No, no, no. It's just...

03:20.762 --> 03:22.094
ten years ago you were

03:22.095 --> 03:23.752
a public school teacher
living in Brooklyn,

03:23.753 --> 03:26.761
and then one summer, you wrote a novel

03:26.762 --> 03:28.427
that was an overnight sensation.

03:28.428 --> 03:31.761
You left your wife and family,
you married your mistress,

03:31.762 --> 03:34.052
you became suddenly famous and...

03:34.053 --> 03:35.719
I don't know, let's say you drank

03:35.720 --> 03:37.248
a little bit of your own Kool-Aid.

03:38.275 --> 03:40.260
You became increasingly arrogant,

03:40.261 --> 03:43.761
self-absorbed, reckless,
until one fateful night

03:43.762 --> 03:45.327
on the dark roads of Montauk,

03:45.328 --> 03:46.969
you hit someone and fled
the scene of the crime...

03:46.970 --> 03:48.917
I'm going somewhere with this.

03:48.918 --> 03:49.969
I hope so.

03:49.970 --> 03:53.302
You had an enormous fall from grace.

03:53.303 --> 03:55.508
You went to prison, you served time,

03:55.509 --> 03:58.133
you... lost everything.

03:59.034 --> 04:00.427
And now you're out,

04:00.428 --> 04:02.928
you've gone back to teaching
underprivileged kids,

04:02.929 --> 04:04.969
you have moved to be
closer to your family.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.966
You seem to be living a quiet life now.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.025
You've come full circle.

04:11.823 --> 04:14.552
So would you say that the redemption

04:14.553 --> 04:16.798
of Noah Solloway is complete?

04:18.762 --> 04:20.261
[chuckles softly]

04:22.613 --> 04:23.697
Um...

04:27.818 --> 04:30.387
Uh, y-you read the book, y-you tell me.

04:31.844 --> 04:34.010
That seems like a perfect place to stop.

04:36.220 --> 04:38.277
I'm really excited about this piece.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.590
People love a comeback story.

04:40.591 --> 04:41.969
When will they run it, do you know?

04:41.970 --> 04:44.469
Well, it's not up to me, but, um,

04:44.470 --> 04:46.930
they're hoping to time it with
the release of your movie.

04:46.931 --> 04:48.769
Your book is coming out
around then, too, isn't it?

04:48.770 --> 04:49.949
That's right.

04:49.950 --> 04:51.844
It's quite a year you're having.

04:51.845 --> 04:53.510
Oh, um, one more thing.

04:53.511 --> 04:54.785
Are you seeing anyone?

04:56.453 --> 04:58.527
Our readers will want to know.

05:00.484 --> 05:02.863
Uh... no.

05:02.864 --> 05:04.245
No, not at the moment.

05:04.246 --> 05:06.498
Really? That surprises me.

05:07.537 --> 05:08.844
Yeah, well, I guess that's, uh,

05:08.845 --> 05:10.678
that's one piece of the puzzle

05:10.679 --> 05:12.678
I haven't quite figured out yet.

05:13.585 --> 05:14.792
There's still time.

05:15.505 --> 05:18.179
Oh, I should probably turn this off.

05:18.845 --> 05:20.344
You still use those things?

05:20.345 --> 05:21.678
I thought young reporters these days

05:21.679 --> 05:22.886
just used their iPhone.

05:22.887 --> 05:24.427
Well, I'm not that young,

05:24.428 --> 05:26.672
and the batteries on these
things last longer.

05:26.673 --> 05:29.177
The last time I saw one,
I was interviewing

05:29.178 --> 05:31.135
a friend in Freshman Psych.

05:31.136 --> 05:33.120
Oh, you know, speaking of friends,

05:33.121 --> 05:34.987
could I call some of them?

05:34.988 --> 05:36.675
You know, to round out the picture?

05:36.676 --> 05:39.010
Who is Noah Solloway, the man?

05:39.011 --> 05:41.135
- Uh, sure. Of course.
- [door closes]

05:41.136 --> 05:42.678
[Joel] I can do that.

05:42.679 --> 05:46.594
I can... talk... for the article.

05:46.595 --> 05:48.094
You're Petra Ranes. I love your work.

05:48.095 --> 05:50.094
I-I read everything you write.

05:50.095 --> 05:51.969
[Petra] Oh, thanks. Uh, who are you?

05:51.970 --> 05:54.184
I'm the principal, actually.

05:54.185 --> 05:57.354
Of this, uh, school.

05:57.355 --> 05:58.844
But we're also friends.

05:58.845 --> 06:01.386
And I'm a novelist, too,
so we have that whole

06:01.387 --> 06:03.344
- simpatico thing going, and...
- You know what?

06:03.345 --> 06:04.761
I-I'll, uh, I'll think
of a couple of names

06:04.762 --> 06:06.094
- and get back to you.
- Great.

06:06.095 --> 06:07.386
Thank you for your time.

06:07.387 --> 06:08.665
Thank you.

06:16.787 --> 06:19.073
Vanity Fair?

06:19.074 --> 06:20.552
Wow.

06:20.553 --> 06:22.788
This is gonna be big for you.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.834
- We'll see.
- I mean, this is...

06:25.835 --> 06:28.302
top-tier literary recognition.

06:28.303 --> 06:30.094
That's rarified air.

06:30.095 --> 06:32.286
You want to go out? Celebrate tonight?

06:32.287 --> 06:34.135
Talk about our craft?

06:34.136 --> 06:35.594
Uh, no. I got to, um,

06:35.595 --> 06:37.344
I got to have dinner with my daughter,

06:37.345 --> 06:39.637
and then I'm gonna be on
set till-till late, so...

06:39.638 --> 06:41.135
"I'm gonna be on set."

06:41.136 --> 06:43.094
Jesus, man. Who are you?

06:43.095 --> 06:45.636
It's okay, I stay up
late. I'll call you.

06:45.637 --> 06:48.594
I mean, I got to buy a beer
for the man who has it all.

06:48.595 --> 06:50.219
Maybe.

06:50.220 --> 06:52.177
[indistinct chatter]

06:52.178 --> 06:54.345
[soft piano music playing]

07:01.317 --> 07:03.096
Is Colin coming,

07:03.097 --> 07:04.337
- or should we just order?
- Uh, no.

07:04.338 --> 07:06.344
He'll be here. He just...

07:06.345 --> 07:08.094
When he works, he can get carried away,

07:08.095 --> 07:09.876
lose track of time.

07:09.877 --> 07:12.380
I can't believe you're getting married.

07:12.381 --> 07:14.181
I know. Me either.

07:15.501 --> 07:16.719
You okay?

07:16.720 --> 07:18.255
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:19.506 --> 07:21.466
- How's work?
- Work's fine.

07:24.758 --> 07:26.029
Whit.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.135
Is something wrong?

07:29.136 --> 07:31.778
I don't want to pry,
but you seem kind of,

07:31.779 --> 07:33.761
- I don't know.
- I'm just tired, Dad.

07:33.762 --> 07:36.301
I-I have to be at the gallery
by seven every morning.

07:36.302 --> 07:38.552
We don't have air conditioning
'cause Andrea's too cheap.

07:38.553 --> 07:40.803
It's hot as hell and, you
know, I'm doing everything:

07:40.804 --> 07:43.719
I-I hang the art, I man the
phones, I keep the books.

07:43.720 --> 07:46.713
All she does is check her
Raya profile and freak out.

07:46.714 --> 07:48.219
What's a...? Never mind.

07:48.220 --> 07:49.704
So you don't like this job?

07:49.705 --> 07:52.052
I mean, it beats copy editing Art Forum.

07:52.053 --> 07:54.202
Well, maybe you could
find another gallery

07:54.203 --> 07:55.869
where the boss is a
little more reasonable.

07:55.870 --> 07:57.186
I can't quit. We need the money.

07:57.187 --> 07:59.813
Colin still can't work 'cause
of his visa situation, so...

07:59.814 --> 08:02.969
Well, would it help if
I gave you the money,

08:02.970 --> 08:04.844
- just to...
- Oh, no. Thanks, Dad.

08:04.845 --> 08:06.636
That's-that's not it. It's just that...

08:06.637 --> 08:08.344
like, when I come home
from a long day of work

08:08.345 --> 08:09.886
and I just want to, you know,

08:09.887 --> 08:11.511
have a glass of wine and
watch The Kardashians,

08:11.512 --> 08:13.929
I can't because Colin's
all over me to study.

08:13.930 --> 08:16.344
- Study?
- Yeah, for his immigration interview.

08:16.345 --> 08:18.135
You know, they put us in separate rooms,

08:18.136 --> 08:20.052
and if we don't get every
single question perfectly,

08:20.053 --> 08:21.386
Colin doesn't get his citizenship.

08:21.387 --> 08:23.595
Oh, hold on, hold on. Thank you.

08:25.011 --> 08:26.260
[chuckles]

08:26.261 --> 08:28.177
What?

08:29.017 --> 08:30.543
You remind me of your mother.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.094
Because I'm an alcoholic?

08:32.697 --> 08:33.943
No.

08:34.857 --> 08:36.679
'Cause you're so beautiful.

08:38.804 --> 08:40.169
Thanks.

08:41.379 --> 08:42.797
Whitney...

08:44.591 --> 08:47.340
this marriage thing, you don't
have to do it, you know.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.113
It seems rushed.

08:49.114 --> 08:51.511
Yeah, but actually, Dad, I
do, because if I don't,

08:51.512 --> 08:53.052
then Colin has to leave the country.

08:53.053 --> 08:54.601
Well, not forever, right?

08:54.602 --> 08:56.052
I mean, maybe that's for the best.

08:56.053 --> 08:58.052
He can go home, he can
establish himself there,

08:58.053 --> 08:59.923
and then apply for citizenship
on his own merit.

08:59.924 --> 09:02.010
What are you talking about? I'm
not gonna let him get deported.

09:02.011 --> 09:03.265
I-I love him.

09:03.266 --> 09:04.596
I just...

09:05.553 --> 09:07.926
I don't think it's supposed
to be this hard, Whitney.

09:08.553 --> 09:10.260
You are so young.

09:10.261 --> 09:12.358
It's too early to be this hard.

09:12.359 --> 09:14.344
I don't know if you
remember, Mr. Big Shot,

09:14.345 --> 09:16.135
but you were a struggling
artist once, too.

09:16.136 --> 09:17.856
Mom didn't leave you.

09:17.857 --> 09:20.428
I mean, you left her
20 years later, but...

09:23.704 --> 09:25.977
Whitney, I... I had a job.

09:26.937 --> 09:28.427
I was a teacher.

out about something,

at my parents' house,

12:58.762 --> 13:01.135
he's never gonna leave his wife. Okay?

13:02.144 --> 13:03.677
Now, does he say that

13:04.430 --> 13:06.446
because he's a fundamentally good man

13:06.447 --> 13:08.903
who's trying to be honest about
what he has to give her?

13:08.904 --> 13:13.761
Or... does he say that as
some sort of manipulation,

13:13.762 --> 13:16.344
so that she will think
whatever happens next

13:16.345 --> 13:17.886
is actually her own fault?

13:17.887 --> 13:20.427
I mean... the first one.

13:20.428 --> 13:22.489
Because what I just did now,

13:22.490 --> 13:24.427
I shot it both ways so I
can decide in editing,

13:24.428 --> 13:25.844
but I'm not gonna shoot

13:25.845 --> 13:27.281

13:27.282 --> 13:29.761

13:29.762 --> 13:32.219

is more interesting,

13:32.220 --> 13:34.447

He's-he's a family man. He's never done

13:40.415 --> 13:42.794
anything like this before,
and he's-he's just

13:42.795 --> 13:45.511

beyond his control.

14:09.661 --> 14:11.285

14:11.286 --> 14:15.247
If he's undone, as you
say, by transgression...

He can't just [chuckling]

Well, this is a very nice place.

- Do you think so?

was the best restaurant

hasn't been out of Hyannis

Why do you ask?

32:02.699 --> 32:04.010
Um...

32:04.011 --> 32:05.928

doesn't usually like it

32:05.929 --> 32:07.386

32:07.387 --> 32:08.844
And you've been here for a while,

Well, I mean, if you think it's time.

I hate the idea of
leaving you here alone

32:28.595 --> 32:31.135

vulnerable state.

32:31.136 --> 32:33.636
Actually, I've been feeling
a little bit better lately.

32:33.637 --> 32:36.220
- So...
- But your father has dementia.

32:38.428 --> 32:39.719
What?

32:39.720 --> 32:42.719
And he's... lost all our money.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.928
- What?
- Excuse me.

32:44.929 --> 32:46.636
- What?
- Ma'am?

32:46.637 --> 32:49.177
This napkin is covered in mold.

32:49.178 --> 32:51.470
I'd like another. A clean one.

32:52.553 --> 32:54.292
[waiter] Of course, ma'am.

32:54.293 --> 32:55.511
I'm going to have a talk

32:55.512 --> 32:57.219
with Shirley Divets when I get back.

32:57.220 --> 33:00.011
Tell her she's too old to
be making recommendations.

33:00.012 --> 33:01.719
She thinks, just because she slept

33:01.720 --> 33:04.302

she's an authority on every...

33:04.303 --> 33:06.678

stop, stop. What... Okay.

33:06.679 --> 33:08.679
What, what do you mean Dad has dementia?

33:09.649 --> 33:12.246
- Alzheimer's, darling, I think.
- Well, how do you know?

33:12.247 --> 33:14.424
He gets confused, he forgets things.

33:14.425 --> 33:17.005
- So do I.
- It's not the same thing.

33:17.006 --> 33:19.047
The other day, he
couldn't find his keys.

33:19.048 --> 33:21.436
So what? I can never find my car keys.

33:21.437 --> 33:23.602
They were in his hand, Helen.

33:24.370 --> 33:25.615
It's just...

33:26.649 --> 33:28.259
he didn't know what they were.

33:28.260 --> 33:29.942
He didn't know what they were for.

33:35.261 --> 33:37.550
Uh, how long has this been going on?

33:38.211 --> 33:40.188
For a while. About a year.

33:40.189 --> 33:41.615
And you didn't tell me?

33:42.661 --> 33:45.025
You had a lot of things to worry about.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.644
Oh, my God, it never ends.

33:48.645 --> 33:50.260
[chuckling] I know.

33:50.261 --> 33:52.093
It feels like that
sometimes, doesn't it?

33:52.781 --> 33:54.511
And w-wait, who is with him now?

33:54.512 --> 33:57.313
- Is he alone?
- Of course not, Helen.

33:57.974 --> 33:59.377
We have a live-in nurse.

33:59.378 --> 34:01.939
Norene, and she's lovely.

34:01.940 --> 34:04.052
And she's very expensive,
I can't afford her.

34:04.557 --> 34:05.898
That's why I have to move back.

34:05.899 --> 34:07.761
[stammers] And, okay, what do you mean

34:07.762 --> 34:08.886
he lost all of your money?

34:08.887 --> 34:10.969
He gave a lot of it away to charity,

34:10.969 --> 34:12.302
which should have been my first clue

34:12.303 --> 34:14.083
there was something seriously wrong.

34:14.083 --> 34:17.083
And he made some idiotic investments.

34:17.083 --> 34:18.886
It's not all gone, mind you.

34:18.887 --> 34:20.511
We just have to be careful.

34:20.512 --> 34:23.010
If worst comes to worst,
we can sell the house.

34:23.011 --> 34:24.498
Oh, my God. Sell the house?

34:24.498 --> 34:26.511
I don't want to, either.

34:26.512 --> 34:28.177
But he needs a lot of care

34:28.178 --> 34:30.094
and I can't manage it on my own.

34:30.094 --> 34:32.245
The money has to come from somewhere.

34:32.246 --> 34:33.762
Unless...

34:37.199 --> 34:38.927
Oh, if you're asking me for money,

34:38.928 --> 34:40.949
I don't have any. Vik left
everything to his parents.

34:40.951 --> 34:43.194
Helen, I'm not asking you for money.

34:43.853 --> 34:46.094
I'm asking you to move back east

34:46.094 --> 34:48.020
and help me take care of him.

34:50.409 --> 34:52.469
It'd be a way to keep the house.

34:52.469 --> 34:54.302
No, but I... the kids...

34:54.303 --> 34:56.422
the kids are in, are in school here.

34:56.422 --> 34:58.048
There are schools on Long Island.

34:58.049 --> 35:00.344
Yes, but they've only
been here a few years.

35:00.345 --> 35:03.049
And to move them back this
soon would just be unfair.

35:03.050 --> 35:04.794

the less disappointed they'll be.

best years of your life

them back, and for what?

It's definitely not fair.
