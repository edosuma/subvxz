00:42.609 --> 00:45.100
Vodka rocks, please.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.745
Hi. How are you?

00:56.856 --> 00:58.915
Thirsty.

01:00.527 --> 01:04.293
Straight up. And no ice this time.

01:04.397 --> 01:10.063
l tell this guy about the ice,
and then he pours me a Scotch rocks.

01:10.770 --> 01:13.637
''About the ice?''

01:13.740 --> 01:16.208
The water actually in the ice.

01:16.276 --> 01:19.211
- l'm an expert on it.
- What's wrong with it?

01:19.279 --> 01:21.713
No big secret. lt's been in the news.

01:21.781 --> 01:26.241
Government additive,
something they call chloramine.

01:26.319 --> 01:29.550
They said it's good for us.
lt's like fluoride.

01:29.622 --> 01:31.590
That's what they say.

01:31.658 --> 01:35.150
l didn't sit down here to scare you.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.989
On the contrary.

01:41.401 --> 01:43.835
Would you like to get some air?

01:54.147 --> 01:57.605
Long way to go for a drink.

01:57.684 --> 02:00.517
You like living out here?

02:03.756 --> 02:05.849
How much farther?

02:05.959 --> 02:08.291
Just over the bridge.

02:30.383 --> 02:33.477
What the hell are you doing?

02:33.553 --> 02:36.044
Let go!

02:36.789 --> 02:39.519
You're gonna kill us.

04:20.726 --> 04:21.954
Last season:

04:22.060 --> 04:26.725
There was a rumored program out of
the Cold War, a plan to create a super-soldier.

04:26.799 --> 04:29.495
Said Scully's in the program too.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.298
- Your baby was a miracle.
- My baby is normal.

04:32.405 --> 04:35.431
She may never make it out of this building.

04:37.343 --> 04:39.504
Get him off.

04:41.814 --> 04:45.750
- This is my baby. Don't let them take it.
- Push, Dana.

04:45.818 --> 04:48.082
This office is under investigation

04:48.154 --> 04:52.181
for the late-night meeting
between you and Knowle Rohrer.

04:52.292 --> 04:56.524
- You investigate what l tell you.
- You put me on the X-Files.

04:56.629 --> 05:01.532
l think what we feared were the possibilities.
The truth, we both know.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.965
lt's all right.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.334
lt's gonna be OK.

06:45.938 --> 06:49.430
Monica, it's me. Did l wake you?

06:52.044 --> 06:54.638
Brad? No, l'm awake.

06:56.215 --> 06:58.274
You're in town.

06:58.384 --> 07:01.148
l came in on short notice.

07:01.254 --> 07:07.955
lf you're coming to the Hoover Building,
can you stop by my office on your way in?

07:08.060 --> 07:10.893
Sure, l can do that.

07:10.963 --> 07:13.898
Good. Looking forward to it.

07:32.285 --> 07:36.312
..death of a government employee last night.
The body of Carl Wormus,

07:36.389 --> 07:39.790
an administrator
for the Environmental Protection Agency,

07:39.859 --> 07:43.351
was pulled from the Potomac
by divers this morning.

07:43.463 --> 07:47.661
Wormus drove his car
through a barricade and into the river.

07:47.767 --> 07:50.861
A police spokesperson says he was alone...

08:01.881 --> 08:04.213
- Monica?
- Hi.

08:04.317 --> 08:07.218
- What are you doing?
- Leaving you a note.

08:07.320 --> 08:12.986
Your assistant was out and l didn't
wanna knock. l was gonna call you.

08:16.529 --> 08:18.622
Come on in.

08:31.077 --> 08:33.409
What?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.913
We're at work.

08:37.817 --> 08:42.583
You used to ask me to close the door
at work back in New York.

08:42.688 --> 08:47.148
ls that all you called me here for,
Assistant Director?

08:47.226 --> 08:51.754
l probably shouldn't tell you
how hot you look either. Cos you do.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.992
How long as it been? Two years?

08:57.537 --> 09:01.405
We should catch up. Really.
l've gotta get downstairs.

09:01.507 --> 09:04.237
l've got something for you.

09:08.014 --> 09:14.214
Forgive me, but it didn't take a whole lot of
digging to figure out why you're here in DC.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.620
What are those?

09:17.723 --> 09:21.124
Something you're gonna see.
l wanted to show you first.

09:21.227 --> 09:26.221
They were taken from the security cameras
in the FBl parking garage.

09:26.299 --> 09:30.099
One of them shows you arrive in a cab
meeting John Doggett.

09:30.202 --> 09:33.535
l'm working with him.
He called me here on a case.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.574
l heard, believe me.

09:35.641 --> 09:39.543
This whole thing about
a chase and a crash and a fire.

09:40.813 --> 09:46.217
And now Doggett's investigation
of Deputy Director Kersh. lt's big news.

09:46.819 --> 09:53.054
What's so important to show me?
What's on the other tape?

10:05.771 --> 10:08.239
How's your investigation going?

10:08.307 --> 10:12.004
Turned up any
incriminating evidence on me yet?

10:12.111 --> 10:15.012
lt's only Monday morning, sir.

10:16.182 --> 10:19.515
lt's nothing personal, Deputy Director.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.849
l hope you know that.

10:21.954 --> 10:26.288
l know, John.
We've pretty much always seen eye to eye.

10:28.194 --> 10:33.188
l'm sure if you can't find anything on me,
John, nobody can.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.150
How are you doing?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.548
That good.

10:58.658 --> 11:03.857
l didn't ask to be put on the X-Files.
Kersh put me here. l'm just doing my job.

11:03.963 --> 11:08.366
What did he think? That l'd be thankful?
That l'd do anything less?

11:08.467 --> 11:10.230
lt's not gonna be easy.

11:10.336 --> 11:14.864
Hell, no. He's a deputy director,
one man removed from the head of the FBl.

11:14.974 --> 11:18.137
l mean it may be impossible.

11:28.721 --> 11:33.556
- What's this?
- A tape two nights ago from the FBl garage.

11:34.593 --> 11:37.494
You're not on it.

11:38.831 --> 11:42.426
What are you talking about?

11:45.738 --> 11:49.174
This is the wrong damn tape.

11:49.241 --> 11:52.335
l've watched it. There's nothing there.

11:52.411 --> 11:55.039
AD Skinner and l were attacked and chased.

11:55.114 --> 11:59.278
Knowle Rohrer drove his car into the wall.
lt blew up in flames.

11:59.385 --> 12:02.548
Not on this tape.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.625
- Where'd you get this?
- From someone giving me a heads-up.

12:11.731 --> 12:16.395
They can't make this go away. There's
evidence in that garage. There were victims.

12:16.469 --> 12:21.702
l went down to that garage, John. Whatever
happened, they've had 48 hours to clean it up.

12:21.774 --> 12:25.642
- There were witnesses.
- Witnesses who will stand up to this tape?

12:47.299 --> 12:49.392
Mulder, you here?

13:48.894 --> 13:51.192
Naval Telecommunications Command.

13:51.297 --> 13:56.030
l need to make a shore-to-ship call
to the SS Valor Victor.

13:56.135 --> 13:58.000
Sir?

14:06.645 --> 14:10.672
- What? What's the matter?
- l've been trying to call you.

14:10.749 --> 14:13.217
The phone's off the hook because of the baby.

14:13.319 --> 14:18.052
l got panicked you weren't gonna be here,
that you left too.

14:20.492 --> 14:22.551
Come in.

14:27.700 --> 14:32.194
l'm looking for Mulder.
Went to his apartment.

14:32.271 --> 14:35.502
- l know.
- Where'd he go?

14:38.377 --> 14:42.279
Dana, where'd he go?

14:43.415 --> 14:45.781
He's gone.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.347
He's just gone.

15:37.403 --> 15:40.304
l don't know where Mulder is.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.611
l don't know that l'd tell you if l did.

15:49.148 --> 15:54.347
l checked with movers, airlines,
car rental agencies. No Mulder.

15:55.354 --> 15:58.687
Somebody get to him? That it?

15:58.791 --> 16:02.818
Doesn't seem possible, does it?

16:04.430 --> 16:06.694
OK. Where's that leave us?

16:06.799 --> 16:11.668
lt's just me and you -
our word against Kersh and the FBl.

16:12.504 --> 16:15.769
You'd better sit down.
lt's more complicated than that.

16:15.841 --> 16:20.505
- What's more complicated?
- This investigation.

16:20.612 --> 16:22.978
What about it?

16:26.885 --> 16:30.013
l wanna ask you to drop it.

16:30.122 --> 16:36.618
No, not from you. Not after what we've been
through. We barely escaped with our lives.

16:36.695 --> 16:38.959
That's something worth thinking about.

16:39.031 --> 16:42.990
l'm sorry. You're not that reasonable.
Did they get to you too?

16:43.068 --> 16:46.731
No one got to me.
They didn't have to. That's the point.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.905
You're afraid of them.

17:01.920 --> 17:06.152
- l'm not afraid of them.
- You're afraid of something.

17:06.892 --> 17:09.326
What?

17:09.395 --> 17:14.025
The real tape showing up? Them calling you
a killer for you having to shoot Krycek?

17:14.098 --> 17:16.396
l'll stand by my actions,

17:16.502 --> 17:21.997
but l won't stand by yours if you're gonna
push and push until you get somebody killed.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.736
You wanna know what l fear?

17:25.844 --> 17:28.506
l fear for Mulder and Scully.

17:28.580 --> 17:32.209
l fear for the life of that child
if you don't stop pushing.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.878
You don't think l fear for those things?

17:34.953 --> 17:38.081
lf you did, you'd let it go.

17:40.359 --> 17:47.458
So what l'm hearing is,
if l don't drop it l'm alone on this.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.154
You're not.

18:43.655 --> 18:47.853
l hope it wasn't presumptuous of me,
l ordered you a martini.

18:49.294 --> 18:52.127
The presumption's all mine.

18:53.198 --> 18:56.326
l called and asked you out, didn't l?

18:59.138 --> 19:04.303
You actually had me confused a little
this morning in my office.

19:04.376 --> 19:09.006
l had this crazy notion
that you were avoiding me.

19:10.048 --> 19:13.506
Maybe l was trying to avoid myself.

19:15.988 --> 19:20.618
And those tapes you pulled out of your desk
weren't exactly Pamela and Tommy Lee.

19:24.863 --> 19:30.301
And l'd heard that
you and John Doggett were tight.

19:31.303 --> 19:36.366
You make it sound like l go home from work
with Post-its on my ass. lt's nothing like that.

19:36.475 --> 19:39.501
Then l don't get it.

19:39.578 --> 19:44.811
Why risk your name and your career getting
caught up in this rabid investigation of his?

19:44.883 --> 19:49.411
There isn't going to be an investigation.
Not any more.

19:52.758 --> 19:59.857
l wouldn't have thought Doggett'd be thrown
off so easy. Not what l've heard about him.

19:59.932 --> 20:03.993
Whatever you may think about him,
Brad, he's not a fool.

20:04.069 --> 20:06.503
Now you're pissed off at me.

20:06.572 --> 20:11.737
No. l'm pissed off because this means l'll be
shipping back to the New Orleans field office.

20:11.843 --> 20:16.246
What are you talking about?
The way l heard it, you're with the X-Files.

20:16.915 --> 20:21.284
This investigation drops,
they're gonna drop the X-Files along with it.

20:23.689 --> 20:27.853
You know me, where my interests lie -
this was my dream assignment.

20:30.395 --> 20:34.695
Not to mention how excited l was
to be up here in DC.

20:36.602 --> 20:40.299
- But you just got here.
- l know.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.275
l'm really sorry.

20:55.287 --> 20:59.724
- Dana, l need your help.
- l don't know how to find him.

21:06.498 --> 21:09.433
ltjust doesn't make any sense.

21:11.069 --> 21:13.970
Mulder leaving you here all alone.

21:14.072 --> 21:18.406
Just walking out on you,
not telling you where and why?

21:18.477 --> 21:23.073
lt makes sense in its own way.
That's all l can tell you.

21:24.082 --> 21:27.176
Then tell me why you can't trust me.

21:28.287 --> 21:32.018
Everything l did to protect you when
your baby was in danger, what changed?

21:32.124 --> 21:35.252
Why is it suddenly l'm now the enemy?

21:41.366 --> 21:43.357
Let it go, John.

21:43.468 --> 21:46.164
Drop it. Please.

21:48.807 --> 21:54.336
They tried to kill me and Skinner, and would
have killed Mulder too. They're still out there.

21:54.446 --> 21:58.348
Exactly right. And they are unstoppable
and they are inside the FBl.

21:58.450 --> 22:02.477
You know something you're not telling me.
Mulder knows something.

22:04.690 --> 22:06.988
How long can you hide from it?

22:09.895 --> 22:12.329
Knowle Rohrer, my old military buddy,

22:12.397 --> 22:17.334
told me your pregnancy was the result of a
cloning experiment to create a super-soldier.

22:17.402 --> 22:20.735
l don't wanna hear this.
There is nothing to any of this.

22:20.839 --> 22:25.970
Knowle Rohrer, my buddy, was one of the
men that tried to kill us in the FBl garage.

22:26.044 --> 22:30.913
My baby, my son, is fine.

22:32.851 --> 22:38.881
l hope to God that's true.
l just don't wanna pretend.

22:43.695 --> 22:46.220
l'm gonna ask you to leave.

22:48.200 --> 22:52.694
l'm gonna ask you to leave
and not come back here.

23:35.781 --> 23:37.874
Directory assistance.

23:37.949 --> 23:40.816
Let's try Maryland, Virginia.

23:40.919 --> 23:44.821
- What listing, please?
- A number for a Ryan Bracker.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.483
B-r-a-c-k-e-r.

23:50.128 --> 23:53.962
l was given this number for
a Roger Erickson of the US Marine Corps.

23:54.065 --> 23:56.090
- Speaking.
- Roger?

23:56.168 --> 23:59.763
- lt's John Doggett, Bravo Company.
- How you doing?

23:59.838 --> 24:02.739
l'm good. lt's good to hear you.

24:02.808 --> 24:05.641
- You remember Knowle Rohrer?
- Sure.

24:05.744 --> 24:10.738
What's his story? Didn't he get involved in
something when we got back? Special Ops?

24:10.816 --> 24:15.276
No idea. l never heard from Knowle
after we got back. We should get together.

24:15.353 --> 24:19.517
Yeah. Let's catch a beer sometime.

24:27.165 --> 24:30.794
This is Shannon. Leave a message.
l'll return it as soon as l can.

24:30.869 --> 24:36.102
This is John Doggett. l'm trying to reach
Shannon McMahon, of Bravo Company.

24:36.174 --> 24:42.306
lf this is she, could you contact me at the
FBl in Washington, DC as soon as possible?

25:10.542 --> 25:14.000
Sleepy time, sweet William.

25:14.079 --> 25:17.014
l'll see you in a couple of hours.

26:40.999 --> 26:43.433
Hello?

28:14.759 --> 28:17.660
lt's Scully.

28:18.863 --> 28:21.354
Dana? What's wrong? Are you all right?

28:21.433 --> 28:25.836
- ls Agent Doggett there?
- Yeah. He's right here with me.

28:28.940 --> 28:31.238
ls something wrong?

28:32.544 --> 28:35.445
Yeah, something.

28:35.547 --> 28:40.541
l think l might have been wrong
telling you to drop your investigation.

28:40.618 --> 28:46.614
l didn't drop it. We found something. l'm
not sure how it fits but we're working on it.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.819
- What is it?
- A body.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.595
Thanks for coming.

29:01.106 --> 29:05.736
The deceased's name is Carl Wormus,
of the Environmental Protection Agency.

29:05.810 --> 29:09.974
Drove through a barricade
and off a bridge two nights ago.

29:11.549 --> 29:12.914
And?

29:12.984 --> 29:18.616
Somebody at the FBl thought it important
enough to stick his obituary under our noses.

29:18.723 --> 29:21.624
- Who?
- We don't know.

29:23.128 --> 29:27.428
His blood alcohol level
was upwards of point one five.

29:27.499 --> 29:30.935
He was drunk. He crashed and drowned.

29:31.970 --> 29:35.133
There's gotta be something more.

29:39.744 --> 29:43.441
- What the hell are you doing?
- Excuse me?

29:43.515 --> 29:48.282
Do you know how many people are waiting
to see you make a mistake like this?

29:48.353 --> 29:50.480
l didn't know l made a mistake.

29:50.588 --> 29:54.820
This EPA guy that you checked out
of the morgue without any jurisdiction.

29:54.926 --> 29:59.420
- Come on.
- All your friends, all your former FBl buddies.

29:59.497 --> 30:02.193
- What?
- They're not your pals any more.

30:02.300 --> 30:07.101
Not since this investigation. Since you
launched an attack on one of your own.

30:07.172 --> 30:08.969
Just watch your back.

30:13.812 --> 30:17.373
Definitive answer how this guy died -
what would that take?

30:17.482 --> 30:18.972
A careful autopsy.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.644
- How fast?
- That's not what l'm saying.

30:21.719 --> 30:27.988
l'd understand if you don't wanna do this,
but you're the only person we can trust.

30:34.232 --> 30:38.066
Collecting for the needy and unemployed.
Open the door.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.832
Thanks for doing this, guys.

30:41.906 --> 30:44.875
Like we've got anything better
to be doing these days.

30:44.976 --> 30:48.571
Just to let you know.
We may need to hit you up for some coin.

30:48.680 --> 30:52.172
Why? What happened to you guys?

30:55.687 --> 30:57.655
Don't ask.

31:01.826 --> 31:06.593
We hacked into the Department of lnterior's
mainframe and got the EPA files you wanted

31:06.698 --> 31:09.166
on this man Carl Wormus.

31:09.234 --> 31:10.861
And?

31:10.935 --> 31:13.597
Are we mind-readers?
That's all you asked for.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.833
What exactly was it you were looking for?
lf we may ask.

31:16.908 --> 31:18.739
l don't know.

31:18.843 --> 31:21.277
lf he had any secrets,
he took them to his grave.

31:21.379 --> 31:25.941
Nothing hinky in his files except
some kind of rabid obsession with water.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.416
- With water?
- Water.

31:28.519 --> 31:32.421
Asphyxiation induced
by the inhalation of water.

31:32.523 --> 31:36.721
There's contusions on the forehead and chest,
but the impact didn't kill him.

31:36.794 --> 31:38.887
This man drowned.

31:41.766 --> 31:45.759
You're looking like you hope there's
something more, but there isn't.

31:45.870 --> 31:50.136
l'm sorry. That's not it.
l'm just impressed that you can do this.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.439
This is what l do, Agent Reyes.

31:54.545 --> 31:57.446
But you're here doing it now.

32:00.785 --> 32:04.084
Something did happen, didn't it?

32:11.162 --> 32:14.928
l know what you're afraid of.

32:16.134 --> 32:19.262
That there's something wrong with your baby.

32:23.808 --> 32:27.505
We can let our fears get the better of us.

32:27.612 --> 32:32.811
We can imagine things, make connections
with things that aren't there.

32:36.254 --> 32:38.154
Like with this man.

32:39.424 --> 32:42.689
lf you ever feel the need
to talk to someone, l'm here.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.695
l'd never betray a confidence.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.797
There is something.

32:50.835 --> 32:53.963
- What?
- Right here on the ankle.

32:57.875 --> 33:02.972
- Are those fingerprints?
- That's what they look like.

33:06.184 --> 33:09.119
From someone holding him down?

33:10.621 --> 33:12.851
l don't know how, or who.

33:12.957 --> 33:17.621
l don't know if you're aware of where
Agent Scully is. She's at Quantico.

33:17.695 --> 33:23.964
Called in by John Doggett to autopsy
a body he's got no authority to touch.

33:30.875 --> 33:37.246
lf l may be blunt, sir,
Doggett's put his tit in the wringer.

33:37.348 --> 33:40.374
Maybe. So what?

33:40.485 --> 33:43.682
A lot of us think that he's lost all judgment.

33:43.755 --> 33:47.589
And one man's actions
should not affect the entire FBl.

33:49.594 --> 33:52.654
We feel he should be called out for this.

33:53.398 --> 33:55.662
Punished?

34:05.910 --> 34:08.606
Thank you, Assistant Director.

34:08.713 --> 34:13.706
lt's a difficult situation to be in.
l appreciate you doing this.

34:15.085 --> 34:18.954
- lt was the right thing to do.
- Let me know how it goes.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.052
Me?

34:24.728 --> 34:27.197
l can't, sir.

34:27.264 --> 34:30.860
There's a conflict. l can't do this myself.

34:30.935 --> 34:35.235
l can't very well do it. How would it look?

34:35.306 --> 34:38.139
l'm under investigation by Agent Doggett.

34:38.242 --> 34:42.076
You have no personal ax to grind.

35:01.899 --> 35:04.424
Hello. Can l help you?

35:04.502 --> 35:06.936
l'm looking for Dana Scully.

35:07.004 --> 35:09.939
She's not here. Can l tell her who's calling?

35:10.007 --> 35:13.773
We work together.
Do you know where l can find her?

35:17.448 --> 35:20.815
Would you like to leave a message?

35:20.918 --> 35:24.479
l'll leave her a note,
if you wouldn't mind opening the door.

35:24.589 --> 35:29.253
Why don't you just leave your name?
l'll have Dana call you.

35:50.815 --> 35:56.481
You need to refrigerate this body to preserve
him as evidence. Whatever he's evidence of.

35:56.554 --> 35:59.614
Whatever it is,
l can't reach John to even tell him.

35:59.690 --> 36:03.649
Monica, l don't know what to say.
But good luck.

36:03.728 --> 36:06.663
l gotta go. l gotta get home.

36:14.005 --> 36:19.739
Third floor they have a cooler for the teaching
cadavers. You can temporarily put him there.

36:19.844 --> 36:23.007
Behind us. Just keep walking.

36:23.981 --> 36:27.417
- Who is she?
- l'd never seen her before this morning.

36:27.518 --> 36:29.543
Now l've seen her twice.

36:44.569 --> 36:49.233
- Excuse us. Where's Agent Doggett?
- What are you doing, Brad?

36:49.340 --> 36:52.537
What am l doing?
l'm doing my best to cover your ass.

36:52.610 --> 36:55.943
- What are you talking about?
- l'm talking about these.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.413
- Let go of me.
- What's going on here?

37:12.930 --> 37:15.262
Where'd he go?

37:15.366 --> 37:18.733
Who? Where'd who go?

37:20.871 --> 37:23.897
Where did Doggett take the body?

37:23.975 --> 37:29.106
You're not making any sense.
Agent Doggett didn't take any body anywhere.

37:30.581 --> 37:34.381
You're looking at me like
you don't believe me. Ask Agent Scully.

37:36.053 --> 37:40.547
l'm gonna go now. l've got a child at home.

37:46.564 --> 37:51.661
Body or no body,
you were here doing an autopsy.

37:52.970 --> 37:57.168
Doggett was here, without authorization.

37:58.476 --> 38:03.072
- Without authorization?
- He's out of control, Monica.

38:03.781 --> 38:06.807
Forget the X-Files.
He'll take you down with him.

38:09.453 --> 38:16.655
This was you, wasn't it? You floated that
obituary to me to set Doggett up. Using me?

38:17.795 --> 38:20.821
l don't know what you're talking about.

38:20.931 --> 38:25.265
You came to me for help.
l'm only trying to help you help yourself.

38:25.336 --> 38:31.832
l know exactly what you're doing. Don't forget
to piss on all the corners before you leave.

38:31.942 --> 38:35.378
l didn't float any obituary.

38:35.479 --> 38:38.471
What's she talking about?

38:41.819 --> 38:43.787
Son of a...

38:47.491 --> 38:53.896
After the violence attempted on Doggett, l'd
check who's at the door before opening it.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.969
Next time l'll get a chair.

38:59.036 --> 39:02.301
- Agent Doggett's gone.
- What do you mean ''gone?''

39:02.373 --> 39:05.069
He and Skinner split for Maryland.

39:05.176 --> 39:10.239
Show her what we found,
before she makes any nasty remarks.

39:10.348 --> 39:16.844
lt took some real hacking, but Carl Wormus -
the EPA man who drowned in his car -

39:16.921 --> 39:21.358
he'd been receiving encrypted email data
from a water reclamation plant in Maryland,

39:21.425 --> 39:24.553
from a worker there
named Roland McFarland.

39:25.763 --> 39:28.596
- Encrypted data on what?
- Don't know.

39:28.699 --> 39:32.658
But whatever it is may have gotten
both these men killed.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.887
There are no nameplates.

39:53.958 --> 39:56.222
l see that.

39:56.293 --> 40:01.925
This is madness. Even if he connects to your
investigation, we don't know the right area.

40:02.032 --> 40:05.126
This has gotta be McFarland's area.

40:19.116 --> 40:22.244
This might be his desk.

40:26.056 --> 40:30.459
- Let's just grab the hard drive and go.
- l'm not sure if it's his.

40:30.561 --> 40:35.260
Somebody's gonna come walking in
any minute and it's not gonna matter.

40:35.332 --> 40:37.926
Just keep an eye out.

40:44.074 --> 40:48.067
- What's chloramine?
- Why are you asking me?

40:48.145 --> 40:52.104
This is McFarland's desk.
He's got tons of files on chloramine.

40:52.183 --> 40:55.482
l'm betting it figures into all this somehow.

40:57.922 --> 41:00.584
Grab the files and go.

42:26.577 --> 42:29.239
Assistant Director.

42:29.947 --> 42:33.906
Looks like you and l are chasing
the same man.
