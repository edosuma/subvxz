Three...

23:16.002 --> 23:17.017
Two!

23:19.009 --> 23:20.021
One!

23:20.023 --> 23:23.020
- It really is just not
thought out, Dory.

23:26.022 --> 23:28.000
- [screams]

23:28.002 --> 23:29.009
[grunts]

23:30.013 --> 23:32.000
- Aw.

23:32.002 --> 23:33.006
- [panting]

23:33.008 --> 23:35.002
- My pen.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.018
- I feel so taken advantage of.
Do you know what I mean?

23:39.020 --> 23:41.005
- Yes.
- Course I know what you mean.

23:41.007 --> 23:42.015
Look at me.
- It's like, "Thanks."

23:42.017 --> 23:44.013
I just, like--
I just threw, like,

23:44.015 --> 23:46.007
a congratulations on you--

23:46.009 --> 23:48.001
"you're not guilty
for murder" party

23:48.003 --> 23:51.001
for someone that I do
specifically know is guilty.

23:51.003 --> 23:52.022
- I just wish that...

23:53.000 --> 23:55.003
things were, like,
simple and straightforward.

23:55.005 --> 23:57.003
It's like, how did
all this chaos happen?

23:57.005 --> 23:58.016
- I don't know.
I fucking know don't.

23:58.018 --> 24:01.015
- I mean, I used to be
a good boy, like...

24:01.017 --> 24:04.001
I ate all my vegetables...
- You're a good boy.

24:04.003 --> 24:07.001
- And, like, I shared them
like crazy!

24:07.003 --> 24:09.003
It's, like...

24:09.005 --> 24:11.016
Why can't I be happy?

24:12.020 --> 24:16.011
I just, like, wanna go
to a happy place.

24:16.013 --> 24:17.023
- You know,
reading that Dory letter

24:18.001 --> 24:19.010
from before
when we were over there?

24:19.012 --> 24:20.016
- Yeah. Yes.

24:20.018 --> 24:22.016
- I was like,
"I have to look within."

24:22.018 --> 24:24.012
And I was like, like,
"I don't want to be that."

24:24.014 --> 24:25.021
- Yeah.
- I don't wanna hide

24:25.023 --> 24:27.008
from America.
- Yes.

24:27.010 --> 24:29.004
- And if I'm gonna do
this Charlie Reenie show,

24:29.006 --> 24:31.004
I wanna do it right,
you know what I mean?

24:31.006 --> 24:32.015
- Yes.
- I wanna have

24:32.017 --> 24:35.007
real conversations
that heal this country,

24:35.009 --> 24:37.008
that heal this sick nation.

24:37.010 --> 24:38.021
You know what I mean?
And you guys have to

24:38.023 --> 24:41.007
hold me accountable for that.
- Yes. We will.

24:41.009 --> 24:43.006
- You guys have to
hold me accountable.

24:43.008 --> 24:45.004
Hold me accountable.
- We're friends, you idiot.

24:45.006 --> 24:46.016
- Hold me accountable.

24:46.018 --> 24:49.001
You promise
to hold me accountable?

25:08.004 --> 25:09.010
You know what I'm gonna do
right now?

25:09.012 --> 25:11.002
- What?
- Mm?

25:12.004 --> 25:13.018
- Instead of talking shit
about Dory...

25:13.020 --> 25:14.020
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

25:14.022 --> 25:16.001
- I'm gonna call her right now.

25:16.003 --> 25:17.012
- Yes!
- [giggles] Oh, my God.

25:17.014 --> 25:19.001
- Yes! Yes!
- And I'm gonna tell her--

25:19.003 --> 25:21.008
I'm gonna tell her exactly
how I feel about her.

25:21.010 --> 25:23.010
- Fuck yes, Elliot.
Fuck yes, fuck yes.

25:23.012 --> 25:25.005
- Shh.
- This is such a good idea.

25:25.007 --> 25:27.003
- [whispering] She's a bitch.
She's a bitch. She's a bitch.

It's Elliott.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.017
I just want to tell you
that I'm really unhappy

25:38.019 --> 25:39.023
with you right now.

25:40.001 --> 25:41.019
The way that you're
treating your friends,

25:41.021 --> 25:44.009
nay, "the gang"...

25:45.005 --> 25:47.003
Is unacceptable.

25:47.005 --> 25:49.006
Quite frankly,
you're an asshole,

25:49.008 --> 25:51.018
and I've never been treated
so poorly in my life

25:51.020 --> 25:53.007
by someone
that I used to consider

25:53.009 --> 25:54.015
one of my best friends.

25:54.017 --> 25:56.001
Goodbye.
- Dory!

25:56.003 --> 25:57.005
It's Portia.

25:57.007 --> 25:59.010
I'm so mad at you!

25:59.012 --> 26:01.018
You--you ruined my life!

26:01.020 --> 26:04.009
You are mean!
You are a bad friend!

26:04.011 --> 26:07.001
And you should feel bad
because you're the ugly friend!

26:07.003 --> 26:08.022
And I'm the pretty friend,
and...

26:09.000 --> 26:10.014
- Dory, it's Drew.

26:10.016 --> 26:13.000
Honestly, it is so fucked up

26:13.002 --> 26:15.020
the way that you treated me
and everyone else.

26:15.022 --> 26:18.006
It's, like, I'm sorry
if this is too much

26:18.008 --> 26:22.021
