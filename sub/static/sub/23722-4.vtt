00:01.340 --> 00:02.514
you... Ramone!

...Don't come at it from
fear because the fear will

00:04.718 --> 00:06.752
destroy you.
You think one of our students

00:06.820 --> 00:08.754
did this? This is payback for not

00:08.822 --> 00:11.389
- getting their White pride club.
- (THUDDING)

00:11.457 --> 00:13.524
I'd like to take a look at your game.

00:13.593 --> 00:15.727
- Why? You want to analyze it?
- I want to learn

00:15.795 --> 00:17.696
- more about you.
- I'll send you a link.

00:17.763 --> 00:20.498
Greg, I still need you to want me.

00:20.566 --> 00:22.500
- Happy birthday!
- Well, thank you!

00:22.568 --> 00:26.504
- (RUSTLING)
- (TYPING)

00:26.572 --> 00:29.574
Thank you for flying to Vancouver.

00:29.641 --> 00:30.812
- It's no prob.
- (GIGGLING)

00:30.837 --> 00:32.732
Kind of a few things I
need to do up here anyway.

00:32.756 --> 00:34.758
- I'll get to it.
- We'd like to publish in

00:34.783 --> 00:36.951
the fall. And we'd love for
your father to write the

00:36.976 --> 00:40.094
- foreward.
- Imam Chuck, this is my

00:40.119 --> 00:42.019
husband. I would love to have

00:42.087 --> 00:45.288
- you both over for dinner.
- Well, yes, definitely.

00:45.356 --> 00:48.125
- We would love to.
- Audrey Bayer dismissed the

00:48.192 --> 00:51.428
- idea of prosecution.
- Oh come on, fire me?

00:51.496 --> 00:54.131
It was either the empathy
initiative or Math.

00:54.198 --> 00:56.466
AUDREY: You got it wrong,
it was about those kids.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.009
It's either them or Math.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

01:12.707 --> 01:14.541
AUDREY: I was completely misrepresented,

01:14.576 --> 01:16.376
and publicly humiliated on TV,

01:16.412 --> 01:18.611
while he saved his ass
with the school board,

01:18.647 --> 01:19.879
and they killed the funding.

01:19.915 --> 01:22.782
They made my life's work
a joke on the news!

01:22.818 --> 01:26.285
And you're just supposed
to walk away and do nothing?

01:26.321 --> 01:28.187
- Fuck them!
- Fuck them!

01:28.222 --> 01:29.456
We can fight this.

01:29.491 --> 01:31.624
All we need is money.

01:31.660 --> 01:33.025
Federal grants.

01:33.061 --> 01:35.662
Cut to the bone. Virtually impossible.

01:35.697 --> 01:38.130
All right, so we turn
to the private sector.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.499
Who do we know that's really rich?

01:39.534 --> 01:41.734
The Lattimers, but it all goes to cancer.

01:42.586 --> 01:44.036
Um...

01:44.072 --> 01:45.237
The Fallons.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.739
But they focus on Children's Hospital.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.842
The Handelmans are strictly Alzheimer's.

01:49.877 --> 01:53.145
Wendy Ellis is so cheap, she
doesn't give anything to anybody.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.047
- That's obscene.
- Isn't it?

01:57.718 --> 01:59.651
What about Steve Benjamin?

02:01.188 --> 02:02.420
Oh, wow.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.123
Steve Benjamin. Right! He's in Portland.

02:05.158 --> 02:08.494
Made a fortune in
clean energy or something.

02:08.529 --> 02:11.196
So he still might have
a social conscience.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.164
Why haven't we reached out?

02:13.200 --> 02:15.077
Was such a sweetheart.

02:15.735 --> 02:17.535
The three of us had so much fun together.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.137
We did.

02:19.172 --> 02:20.472
He was a good guy.

02:20.507 --> 02:21.939
And he had a thing for you.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.408
Oh, I know.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.310
I think he wanted to sleep with you.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.212
Yeah.

02:27.247 --> 02:28.746
It could have happened,

02:28.781 --> 02:31.483
but I never let it go there.

02:31.518 --> 02:33.651
I couldn't.

02:33.686 --> 02:35.319
I was all yours.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.188
Body and soul.

02:40.493 --> 02:44.428
It would be really weird
to go to him now,

02:44.463 --> 02:46.191
begging for dollars.

02:46.866 --> 02:50.034
Maybe money has changed him, who knows.

02:50.069 --> 02:51.435
Let's give him a shot.

02:51.470 --> 02:52.903
Nothing to lose.

02:52.938 --> 02:54.871
If he says no, we'll just keep fighting.

02:57.976 --> 02:59.976
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

03:04.350 --> 03:05.515
Ah!

03:05.551 --> 03:07.250
I feel fantastic.

03:07.285 --> 03:09.085
Establishing the body-mind connection...

03:09.120 --> 03:10.687
Aah, shit!

03:17.462 --> 03:19.162
Okay.

03:21.599 --> 03:22.865
Okay.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.167
I feel fantastic.

Body-mind connection,

03:25.937 --> 03:28.003
first thing in the morning.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.680
(EXHALES) Ah, greetings!

03:37.715 --> 03:39.615
Hey, did I wanna get up this morning

03:39.650 --> 03:41.516
and go to the pool? Not really.

03:41.552 --> 03:43.518
But establishing the body-mind connection

03:43.554 --> 03:45.387
- first thing in the morning means...
- Excuse me.

03:45.422 --> 03:46.321
What?

03:46.356 --> 03:48.523
You have a little snot
coming out of your nose.

03:48.559 --> 03:50.392
Ah, shit. Really? (BLOWS NOSE)

03:50.427 --> 03:51.426
I thought you'd want to know.

03:51.462 --> 03:53.729
I mean, it seems like
it would be important to you.

03:54.698 --> 03:55.763
(CHUCKLES)

03:55.799 --> 03:57.299
Uh, this isn't vanity.

03:57.334 --> 03:59.501
This is for work. This is my brand.

03:59.536 --> 04:00.835
Sure.

04:00.870 --> 04:03.371
Don't worry, you'll get it right
eventually. Yeah, I know.

04:03.407 --> 04:04.772
I'm only trying to help.

04:04.808 --> 04:07.075
Yeah, well, I'm good.

04:07.111 --> 04:09.578
That's quite an ego you've got there.

04:09.613 --> 04:10.979
"Pride goeth before a fall."

04:11.014 --> 04:13.815
Okay, well, pride is actually healthy.

04:13.850 --> 04:15.483
- It's not ego.
- (SIGHS)

04:15.518 --> 04:17.250
It's self-esteem.

04:17.286 --> 04:18.385
It's self-confidence.

04:18.421 --> 04:20.053
It's self-actualization,

04:20.089 --> 04:21.755
and I'm not falling!

04:33.503 --> 04:35.169
<i>Ah!</i>

04:35.204 --> 04:38.272

and go for a swim?</i>

04:38.307 --> 04:39.540
<i>Hell, no.</i>

You've already got skis.

Those are downhill.

06:04.858 --> 06:06.790
These are powder. Completely different.

And you've got the snowboard.

11:11.522 --> 11:14.355
Marriage is more than that, though.

11:14.391 --> 11:16.591
It's a binary organism.

11:16.627 --> 11:18.660
It lives and breathes

11:18.695 --> 11:21.162
and changes and grows.

11:21.197 --> 11:24.399
It's an expression of our
highest human ideals:

11:24.434 --> 11:27.301
loyalty, fidelity,

11:27.337 --> 11:28.503
courage.

11:28.538 --> 11:31.605
Marriage is... is like a row boat.

11:31.641 --> 11:33.174
Sometimes, you're in it together.

11:33.209 --> 11:35.910
Sometimes, one of you falls out.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.145
Sometimes, she helps you back in.

11:38.180 --> 11:40.848
Sometimes, she smacks you
on the head with the oar.

11:40.883 --> 11:42.382
(LAUGHS)

11:42.418 --> 11:44.051
I love this. Yeah, you're on a roll.

11:44.086 --> 11:45.485
Sometimes, you row together,

11:45.521 --> 11:47.431
but one of you rows so hard

11:47.466 --> 11:49.790
that you wind up just
going around in circles.

11:49.825 --> 11:52.026
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)
- Sometimes, you just...

11:53.695 --> 11:54.961
Oh!

11:55.864 --> 11:57.397
- Hey.
- Hey!

11:57.433 --> 11:59.166
Am I interrupting?

11:59.201 --> 12:01.034
GREG: Oh, um, Duc.

12:01.070 --> 12:03.537
Uh, you know Michael, right?

12:03.572 --> 12:05.172
Yeah. From the party.

12:05.207 --> 12:06.506
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:08.043 --> 12:09.609
Yeah, we were just sitting around

12:09.644 --> 12:11.678
shooting the shit, as always.

12:11.713 --> 12:12.879
(MICHAEL LAUGHS)

12:15.917 --> 12:17.416
- I'll go.
- Okay.

12:17.452 --> 12:19.251
You can stay.

12:21.222 --> 12:22.722
So what can I do for you?

12:24.559 --> 12:25.858
Um...

12:27.061 --> 12:28.894
Well.

12:28.929 --> 12:31.564
I was wondering if, uh,
you'd be interested

12:31.599 --> 12:34.200
in writing the foreword for my book.

12:38.206 --> 12:40.172
My son is publishing a book.

12:40.208 --> 12:42.040
Wow! That's fantastic.

12:42.076 --> 12:43.308
Congratulations, Duc.

12:43.343 --> 12:46.612
I would be honored
to write your foreword, son.

12:46.647 --> 12:48.246
(CHUCKLES)

12:48.281 --> 12:49.648
Aw, thanks, Dad.

12:49.683 --> 12:51.917
That means a lot.

12:51.952 --> 12:53.351
Well...

12:54.655 --> 12:56.121
Oh. Uh...

12:56.156 --> 12:57.623
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

12:57.658 --> 13:01.058
Uh, well, I'm just gonna let you get
back to your philosophizing, so...

13:01.094 --> 13:03.294
- You... you don't wanna...?
- DUC: Ah, you know.

13:03.330 --> 13:06.097
MICHAEL: Nice seeing you.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.298
You too.

13:11.804 --> 13:13.904
- Oh, boy.
- What?

13:13.940 --> 13:16.279
I'm not sure what to write.

13:16.943 --> 13:20.244
His book doesn't speak to me.

13:21.280 --> 13:24.148
It's all iron-willed self-discipline,

13:24.183 --> 13:25.415
or is that self-denial?

13:25.451 --> 13:26.717
I-I can't figure it out.

13:26.753 --> 13:28.753
I don't know. Maybe it's generational.

13:29.922 --> 13:31.856
Well, I could read it.

13:31.891 --> 13:34.591
We could talk about it. Might help.

13:34.627 --> 13:37.227
Well, you'd be doing me a huge favor.

13:38.330 --> 13:40.297
But you need to be honest.

13:40.332 --> 13:43.800
I don't want you just telling me
what you think I want to hear.

13:44.670 --> 13:46.370
You do that, you know.

13:46.405 --> 13:48.004
Promise.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.073
Okay. Good boy.

13:56.014 --> 13:57.914
Hey, Jessica, it's Ashley Collins.

13:57.949 --> 13:59.015
I was just calling to...

13:59.051 --> 14:01.284
No, it's okay. Hardly anybody RSVP'ed.

14:03.321 --> 14:04.754
Stitches?

14:04.790 --> 14:07.990
Okay. Yeah. Well, never mind.

14:08.025 --> 14:10.293
Your mom's here.

14:10.328 --> 14:11.860
Good morning!

14:11.896 --> 14:13.762
Good morning.

14:13.798 --> 14:15.464
What's up?

14:15.500 --> 14:17.766
I need business advice.

14:19.737 --> 14:21.304
I thought Duc was your go-to.

14:21.339 --> 14:23.772
Where did you get that idea?

14:23.808 --> 14:27.042
You're both knowledgeable
and highly successful.

14:27.078 --> 14:29.544
But he'll make me do push-ups
before he tells me anything.

14:29.580 --> 14:31.113
(CHUCKLES)

14:33.117 --> 14:35.550
It won't take long, but I
understand if you're too busy.

14:35.586 --> 14:37.385
No, no, no. It's... it's fine.

14:37.421 --> 14:39.421
You're here. So, tell me.

14:39.456 --> 14:42.824
- How do you do The Kickstarter?
- (CHUCKLES)

14:42.859 --> 14:45.760
I have to finance the Empathy Initiative.

14:45.795 --> 14:47.395
The funds were yanked.

14:47.431 --> 14:49.531
(GASPS) Oh, Mom, I'm sorry.

14:49.566 --> 14:52.267
Okay, well, first, it's just Kickstarter,

14:52.302 --> 14:53.368
not The Kickstarter.

14:53.403 --> 14:55.803
Uh, and I'm not really
sure that's what you need.

14:55.839 --> 14:59.006
(STAMMERING) It's a lot of people
chipping in for a good cause.

14:59.042 --> 15:00.474
That's my understanding.

15:00.509 --> 15:02.210
I mean, how is that not perfect for me?

15:02.245 --> 15:03.144
How could that not work?

15:03.179 --> 15:05.679
Kickstarter, it's all or nothing money.

15:05.715 --> 15:08.249
Okay? And what you need is
is an ongoing source

15:08.284 --> 15:11.219
of income for a continuing
education program.

15:12.455 --> 15:14.121
Couldn't they make an exception?

15:14.156 --> 15:16.457
Well, no, it means
tracking your contributors

15:16.492 --> 15:18.392
and giving them updates and rewards.

15:18.427 --> 15:19.627
It's a really big job.

15:19.662 --> 15:22.696
- Rewards? For charity?
- Yeah.

15:22.732 --> 15:24.831
That's insane. That's... that's...

15:24.867 --> 15:26.467
the opposite of charity.

15:26.502 --> 15:28.969
I know, but that's how they do it.

15:29.004 --> 15:31.204
No exceptions, I'm sorry.

15:31.240 --> 15:34.007
Wouldn't you rather get
$100,000 from one person?

15:34.042 --> 15:37.443
Rather than $50,000
from 100 different people

15:37.479 --> 15:39.379
who want prizes?

15:39.414 --> 15:40.541
Don't you know somebody rich

15:40.576 --> 15:43.183
who'd like to atone
by financing a good cause?

15:44.452 --> 15:48.421
That's exactly what Dad said,
that much shit.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.459
(SIGHS)

15:53.495 --> 15:57.096
Mom, come here. You're tired.

15:57.131 --> 15:58.564
Come on.

15:58.600 --> 16:03.302
Thirty years of nonprofits will do that.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.070
You know...

16:06.607 --> 16:08.274
I envy you.

16:09.310 --> 16:12.044
You've always been smarter than I am.

16:13.214 --> 16:14.680
This is so much easier

16:14.715 --> 16:17.616
than trying to make
the world a better place.

16:23.557 --> 16:25.824
- (WHISPERS) Sweetie.
- Hmm?

16:25.859 --> 16:27.158
Thank you.

16:40.841 --> 16:42.841
Lauren, hi.
Thanks for getting back to me.

16:42.876 --> 16:44.909
Can we expect Max at Hailey's...

16:46.179 --> 16:47.345
No?

16:48.481 --> 16:50.648
That's fine. Don't worry.

Are we one farmer or two?

16:56.255 --> 16:58.506
Oh, two. Mm-hmm.

16:58.541 --> 17:01.291
Uh, what's... what's your farmer's name?

17:01.327 --> 17:02.926
Clarence.

17:02.962 --> 17:04.829
"Clarence." (LAUGHS)

What's your farmer name?

17:06.632 --> 17:09.233
Mmm. (CLICKS TONGUE)

17:09.268 --> 17:10.133
Cletus.

17:10.169 --> 17:13.270
Just put down "My bull is stump broke."

17:13.305 --> 17:16.520
The farmers will know
what I mean. (SNICKERS)

17:16.555 --> 17:18.375
What does a stump have to do with it?

17:19.478 --> 17:21.411
Bulls are big, city boy.

17:21.445 --> 17:23.380
Gotta stand on a stump to fuck 'em.

- Come on.
- You know way too much about this.

- Did you grow up on a farm or...?

17:35.627 --> 17:37.326
Maybe.

17:41.478 --> 17:42.911
Where?

17:47.438 --> 17:51.007
This bull. Was it a good relationship?

17:51.042 --> 17:52.909
Mm, yeah. For a while.

17:52.944 --> 17:54.877
Then we broke up.

- Why?
- Come on, man.

17:56.714 --> 17:58.881
I don't know. He didn't
know what he wanted.

I know.

- Say it.

call it "My Portland?" Yeah!

22:16.132 --> 22:17.765
Whatever you like.

22:18.934 --> 22:20.834
Please sit. I'll be right back.

22:30.813 --> 22:32.946
ASHLEY: We are the worst
parents in Portland.

22:32.982 --> 22:36.784
We are so lame, we can't even pull
off a party for a four-year-old.

22:36.819 --> 22:38.652
Well, it's not all our fault.

22:38.687 --> 22:40.387
Those other parents suck, too.

22:40.422 --> 22:42.855
Yeah. Yeah, fuck them!

22:42.891 --> 22:44.324
They... they screwed us.

22:44.359 --> 22:46.259
They screwed Hailey. They're dead to me.

22:48.063 --> 22:49.296
Well, you should have followed up,

22:49.331 --> 22:51.030
but I guess you were
too busy buying skis.

22:51.066 --> 22:52.332
You gave me the guest list.

22:52.367 --> 22:54.480
I sent out the invite.
I sent out the reminder.

22:54.515 --> 22:55.768
You were supposed to follow-up.

22:55.804 --> 22:57.970
Devon's mom said she told you
they couldn't come.

22:58.006 --> 22:59.706
Devon's mom is a drunk.

22:59.741 --> 23:00.840
Everyone knows that!

23:00.875 --> 23:02.641
I never got a call except

23:02.677 --> 23:05.178
from one newly
separated dad... who cried.

23:05.213 --> 23:07.213
I spent hours on the phone today

23:07.248 --> 23:09.688
trying to get a straight answer
from these loser guests.

23:09.724 --> 23:11.284
You are the one who
should have followed up.

23:11.309 --> 23:12.541
This isn't helping.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.955
No, sorry.

23:19.860 --> 23:21.660
She's gotta have a party.

23:27.300 --> 23:29.167
Forest Park.

23:30.003 --> 23:32.270
- What about it?
- Family picnic.

23:32.305 --> 23:34.706
Babe, no. Hailey doesn't want that.

23:34.742 --> 23:36.507
She wants bad pizza,

23:36.543 --> 23:38.509
and... and games, and loud noises.

23:38.545 --> 23:40.212
Some kind of place that
smells like pee and puke.

23:40.247 --> 23:42.047
Sweetie, that's what you want, okay?
Hailey's four.

23:42.082 --> 23:44.382
Riding in somebody else's car
is a big deal for her.

23:44.417 --> 23:48.919
We used to go to Forest Park
all the time when I was a kid.

23:48.955 --> 23:51.155
She'll love it.

23:53.059 --> 23:54.592
It's pretty late notice for your family.

23:54.628 --> 23:56.561
My mother will make them all come.

24:00.867 --> 24:03.200
I could take the drone.

24:03.236 --> 24:05.569
Please don't tell me we have a drone.

24:06.303 --> 24:08.005
GREG: Everybody can make it?

24:08.040 --> 24:09.339
AUDREY: Ramon didn't answer,

24:09.375 --> 24:12.409
but I can't imagine him
missing anything for Hailey.

24:12.444 --> 24:14.845
We'll swing by and pick him up
on the way tomorrow.

24:14.881 --> 24:16.946
Remember, he hates pickles.

24:16.982 --> 24:18.515
No pickles for Ramon!

24:18.550 --> 24:20.550
No mayo for Duc.

24:20.586 --> 24:21.985
No mustard for Kristen.

24:22.020 --> 24:24.087
No cheese for Ashley.

24:24.122 --> 24:26.823
Malcolm's good with all condiments.

24:26.858 --> 24:29.359
He's not very discerning, Malcolm.

24:31.196 --> 24:33.763
Did you call Steve Benjamin?

24:36.334 --> 24:38.868
- No.
- Why not?

24:40.906 --> 24:43.572
Maybe it's time for me to quit.

24:46.178 --> 24:47.553
What?

24:48.346 --> 24:50.097
What are you talking about?

24:50.548 --> 24:54.082
When we were young and thought
about what we'd be like now,

24:55.085 --> 24:57.152
I hoped I'd be so much more.

24:57.188 --> 25:01.156
- Audrey.
- Not in a competitive way, but...

25:01.192 --> 25:02.958
I'm disappointed in myself.

25:02.993 --> 25:06.795
- Why?
- Well, you have your book and tenure.

25:06.831 --> 25:08.730
Steve Benjamin has his billions.

25:08.765 --> 25:10.398
Ashley has her business.

25:10.434 --> 25:13.869
Duc has his... whatever it is.

25:13.904 --> 25:18.106
What do I have to show?
A bourgeois lifestyle.

25:18.142 --> 25:21.609
A few good deeds.
A couple of hits, more misses.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.422
Small-time.

25:23.947 --> 25:25.747
Not much of anything.

25:26.136 --> 25:29.004
And I just got fired.

25:29.786 --> 25:31.519
Audrey...

25:32.422 --> 25:34.856
you raised a family.

25:34.891 --> 25:38.025
That's the most demanding
and creative job there is.

25:39.395 --> 25:42.864
That puts you head and shoulders
above the rest of us.

25:42.899 --> 25:46.100
And in your spare time,
you helped other people.

25:47.203 --> 25:48.870
How many people are alive today

25:48.905 --> 25:50.671
because you talked them out of suicide?

25:50.706 --> 25:54.541
(STAMMERING) I don't remember.
I only remember my mistakes.

25:56.278 --> 25:57.873
You know what we need?

25:58.681 --> 26:02.115
Chips! Chips. Carrot sticks.

26:02.150 --> 26:03.650
The cooler from the basement.

26:03.686 --> 26:05.352
- Cake server!
- No.

26:05.388 --> 26:06.387
Adventure.

26:06.422 --> 26:09.790
A journey to distant lands.
Just the two of us?

26:09.825 --> 26:11.958
Yeah, like we used to.

26:11.994 --> 26:13.426
Except no youth hostels.

26:13.461 --> 26:14.694
Oh my God!

26:14.729 --> 26:16.763
That wreck in India.

26:16.798 --> 26:20.200
The roaches were the size of my leg.

26:20.235 --> 26:22.869
- That place was missing walls.
- (AUDREY LAUGHING)

26:22.905 --> 26:24.837
We peed in a hole.

26:24.873 --> 26:27.772
- With snakes.
- Where should we go?

26:27.808 --> 26:29.909
Some place a little luxe.

26:29.944 --> 26:32.612
King-size bed, hot showers.

26:32.647 --> 26:36.449
- Room service.
- We are not going on a cruise.

26:36.484 --> 26:39.051
- No.
- I will not be trapped

26:39.086 --> 26:40.586
on a floating skyscraper

26:40.622 --> 26:43.562
with bad buffets
and mysterious fatal diseases.

26:43.597 --> 26:44.664
Oh, God, no.

26:44.689 --> 26:46.158
Not to mention what it does to the ocean.

26:46.193 --> 26:48.827
Never on a cruise. I'll Google.

26:51.498 --> 26:53.098
But we can't.

26:54.501 --> 26:57.903
- Yes, we can.
- We can't leave Kristen and Ramon.

26:57.939 --> 26:59.504
Well, not now.

26:59.540 --> 27:01.706
But someday... soon.

27:04.244 --> 27:05.610
Someday.

27:09.550 --> 27:11.249
Love you.

27:12.072 --> 27:13.452

27:25.131 --> 27:27.004
Realtor of the Month.

27:27.567 --> 27:28.666
Thank you.

27:29.339 --> 27:31.802
Thank you from my heart.

27:31.838 --> 27:34.638
For so long, I have dreamed of this day.

27:34.674 --> 27:37.174
But this award is not mine alone.

27:37.209 --> 27:40.611
Somebody else belongs up here
on this stage with me.

27:40.646 --> 27:43.814
My motivational architect,
Duc Bayer-Boatwright!

27:43.850 --> 27:45.315
(CHEERS)

27:45.351 --> 27:47.518
Come up here. Please, Duc.

27:47.553 --> 27:49.186
You're the reason I'm here.

27:49.221 --> 27:52.255
MAN: Go ahead, man!

27:56.595 --> 27:58.628
- Oh.
- Oh!

27:58.663 --> 28:00.563
Oh, well, everything was her.

28:00.599 --> 28:02.832
All I did, Lydia,
was show you the strength

28:02.868 --> 28:04.567
and talent you already had.

28:04.603 --> 28:08.270
Duc told me, "See it. Want it. Have it!"

28:08.306 --> 28:10.740
And I got it! Whoo! Yes! (LAUGHING)

think you can help me?

28:18.182 --> 28:20.182
Glen, I do.

28:20.218 --> 28:23.319
I mean, why shouldn't you have
the adventure and excitement

28:23.354 --> 28:24.786
and passion you deserve?

28:24.822 --> 28:26.555
Yeah. Yeah!

28:26.590 --> 28:27.756
Why shouldn't I?

28:27.791 --> 28:29.691
Why should everyone else
have it and not me?

28:29.727 --> 28:31.860
Make an appointment for
your free consultation, Glen,

28:31.896 --> 28:35.264
and we can begin to draft the
blueprint for your new life.

28:35.299 --> 28:36.999
Oh! Thanks, man.

28:37.035 --> 28:38.867
- You got it.
- Can't wait.

28:40.238 --> 28:41.469
- Hi.
- Hey, I'm Kelly.

28:41.505 --> 28:44.572
Hey, Kelly. I wonder if you can
clear something up for me.

28:44.607 --> 28:47.141
It's a simple question, but...

28:47.176 --> 28:50.678
I'm hoping for a hard answer.

28:51.881 --> 28:53.113
Intriguing.

28:53.149 --> 28:57.418
I've met the most beautiful, sexy man.

28:57.453 --> 28:59.620
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) Kelly.

28:59.656 --> 29:01.488
I see you.

29:01.524 --> 29:03.690
I want you.

29:03.725 --> 29:05.392
Can I have you?

29:06.429 --> 29:09.463
Kelly, I'm very flattered, but...

29:09.498 --> 29:13.133
I'm also very careful
about where I put my...

29:13.169 --> 29:14.968
energy.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.803
Which is why I'm celibate.

29:17.706 --> 29:20.574
That is really difficult to believe.

29:20.609 --> 29:23.176
It's true. I'm sorry.

29:23.211 --> 29:24.945
What a waste.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.279
Selfie?

29:26.314 --> 29:28.548
- With me?
- Yeah, it's for my Instagram.

29:28.584 --> 29:31.017
Every time I post a picture
with a beautiful woman,

29:31.053 --> 29:32.619
my followers spike.

29:32.654 --> 29:34.047

31:15.119 --> 31:17.387
We're hardwired for fear, man.

31:17.422 --> 31:18.502
That's how we've survived

31:18.537 --> 31:20.956
since we climbed out
of the trees and into jungle.

Not everybody. We... we don't
have to be scared all the time.

31:42.880 --> 31:44.346
Right, so you think that we're civilized,

31:44.381 --> 31:46.481
what, because we got, like, gigabytes,

31:46.517 --> 31:48.450
and robots and high-def TV and all that.

31:48.485 --> 31:50.219

31:50.254 --> 31:52.053
you walk out that door,
you go into the street,

31:52.089 --> 31:55.924
you go into the woods,

31:55.959 --> 31:58.059

wouldn't be pissed right now.

bullshit, Henry, okay?

anything about technology.

- That is true.
- And... and second of all,

32:15.846 --> 32:18.213
it isn't separate from real life.

It is... it is part of real life
that you're choosing to avoid.

33:06.495 --> 33:07.927
And everybody around him...

33:07.962 --> 33:09.262
Everybody around him who loves him,

33:09.297 --> 33:10.396
my mom... my mom...

33:10.431 --> 33:11.864
I can't do that, Henry.

33:11.900 --> 33:13.666
I can't be that, all right?

33:13.701 --> 33:15.001
I-I-I won't!

33:15.036 --> 33:16.936
No, you won't. You won't, you won't.

33:16.971 --> 33:18.671
I won't let you.

33:18.706 --> 33:19.939
Come here.

33:19.974 --> 33:22.641
- (SIGHS)
- Look, I'm sorry.

33:22.677 --> 33:24.876
Sorry. I was wrong.

33:24.912 --> 33:26.378
I see that.

33:29.583 --> 33:32.751
Hey. Hey, hey. I'm with you.

33:35.022 --> 33:37.055
- For real?
- For real.

33:40.461 --> 33:42.160
Oh, yeah.

33:44.764 --> 33:45.997
I'm sorry.

33:49.569 --> 33:51.669
So no wife for you? No marriage?

33:51.705 --> 33:53.504
He treats everyone like a patient.

33:53.540 --> 33:55.540
No, no. It's a fair question.

33:55.575 --> 33:57.294
- No.
- Mmm.

33:57.329 --> 34:00.030
But you're neglecting your Muslim
duty, Chuck.

34:00.066 --> 34:02.947
(CHUCK LAUGHS)
I just haven't met the one yet.

34:02.982 --> 34:05.049

34:08.621 --> 34:09.786

34:10.690 --> 34:12.523
Well, that's what I tell him.

34:12.559 --> 34:15.792
- (WHISPERS) I don't think he listens.
- (CHUCK LAUGHS)

34:16.896 --> 34:18.462
I wish you would come to the mosque.

34:18.496 --> 34:21.031
You'd be a great role model
for our young people.

34:21.067 --> 34:23.900
Your whole career has been
about goodness.

34:23.936 --> 34:25.302
Helping others.

34:25.338 --> 34:27.504
You walk a spiritual path.

34:27.539 --> 34:29.406
Can't deny that.

34:29.801 --> 34:31.875
FARID: You converts are so romantic.

34:32.978 --> 34:35.746
But I won't be coming to your mosque.

34:35.781 --> 34:38.114
I have a problem with Muslims.

34:38.149 --> 34:39.783
We all have a problem with each other,

34:39.818 --> 34:42.918
but there's plenty of room
in Islam for that.

34:42.954 --> 34:45.121
But let's be tolerant and generous.

34:45.156 --> 34:48.623
Let's... let's talk about everything.

34:49.761 --> 34:51.094
Hmm.

34:51.129 --> 34:52.962
Muslims like to think they're special.

34:52.998 --> 34:54.730
We are. That's part of our charm.

34:54.766 --> 34:56.732
LAYLA: Doesn't everyone? (CHUCKLES)

34:57.936 --> 34:59.936
Muslims like to self-victimize.

34:59.971 --> 35:02.571
We love to blame outsiders, but...

35:02.607 --> 35:07.810
we never take any responsibility
for our own immoral acts.

35:07.845 --> 35:09.678
Islam is a mercy.

35:09.714 --> 35:11.580
If you see its opposite, cruelty,

35:11.616 --> 35:13.348
then you know that is not Islam.

35:13.384 --> 35:17.686
I'm not talking about
terrorists, and... and ISIS.

35:18.183 --> 35:20.155
I'm talking about Sharia law,

35:20.190 --> 35:21.723
honor killings.

35:21.758 --> 35:23.558
Acid in women's faces.

35:23.593 --> 35:25.027
I agree with you.

35:25.963 --> 35:28.297
Children being forced
to take part in Ashura.

35:28.332 --> 35:31.566
CHUCK: And these are all things that
we need to face as a community.

35:31.601 --> 35:34.436
- You could help us with that.
- Mm-mm.

35:34.471 --> 35:36.004
Not me.

35:39.743 --> 35:41.175
Not me.

35:41.210 --> 35:43.077
I'm a man of reason, not religion.

35:43.112 --> 35:44.646
(WINE POURING)

35:44.681 --> 35:47.348
Those aren't mutually exclusive.

35:47.383 --> 35:49.484
They're both a search for truth.

35:49.519 --> 35:51.218
FARID: Mm, I disagree.

35:51.254 --> 35:54.155
Religion is completely irrational.

35:54.190 --> 35:55.957
- Completely.
- Ah.

35:57.827 --> 35:59.827
It's a convenient tool for oppressors

35:59.862 --> 36:01.495
to manipulate weak minds.

36:01.530 --> 36:02.863
CHUCK: Sometimes, yes.

36:02.898 --> 36:04.798
And we've seen it throughout history.

36:04.834 --> 36:08.069
It destroys families, lives, countries.

36:08.104 --> 36:09.403
That is not the religion.

36:09.439 --> 36:12.573
That is a tragedy of fanaticism.

36:17.179 --> 36:19.079
Layla told me you were there.

36:19.114 --> 36:21.147
Right in the middle of the revolution.

36:21.183 --> 36:22.706
LAYLA: Yes.

36:23.552 --> 36:25.018
The things that he went through.

36:25.053 --> 36:26.138
He was just a child.

36:26.173 --> 36:27.820
- Stop.
- CHUCK: I've studied it, of course.

36:27.856 --> 36:29.789
In depth.

36:29.824 --> 36:31.624
It must have been terrifying.

36:35.663 --> 36:38.231
You studied it. I lived it.

36:44.873 --> 36:46.138
Let me tell you something.

36:46.173 --> 36:48.240
- Farid.
- No, no, he needs to say this.

36:48.275 --> 36:50.977
- How do you know?
- Yeah, how do you know?

36:51.012 --> 36:52.077
Really?

36:52.861 --> 36:54.780
- You expect me to just sit here...
- Farid.

36:54.816 --> 36:58.584
...and listen to a white man
preaching Islam to me?

36:58.620 --> 37:00.185
To me?

37:00.221 --> 37:02.521
Who was there when blood
ran in the streets of Tehran,

37:02.556 --> 37:05.024
because of Islam!

37:07.594 --> 37:09.528
Who the fuck are you
to tell me about religion?

37:09.563 --> 37:12.764
It's true. I am a white man
who found his faith in books.

37:13.634 --> 37:14.766
But my faith is real.

37:14.801 --> 37:18.003
- You want my religion? Take it.
- (SILVERWARE CLATTERS)

37:18.038 --> 37:19.771
You want my culture? I give it freely.

37:19.806 --> 37:21.139
I don't want any part of it.

37:21.174 --> 37:23.074
It's all yours, Chuck.

37:23.109 --> 37:24.976
Go with God.

37:25.012 --> 37:26.947
Go far, far away.

37:26.982 --> 37:29.781
With your imaginary, treacherous God.

37:38.958 --> 37:40.858
LAYLA: I am filled with shame.

37:40.893 --> 37:43.194
Well, you have nothing to be ashamed of.

37:43.229 --> 37:44.728
Other than acting like you never have

37:44.764 --> 37:45.863
a glass of wine with dinner.

37:45.898 --> 37:48.933
You were deliberately aggressive
and offensive in his home.

37:48.968 --> 37:50.801
- He provoked me.
- Bullshit!

37:50.836 --> 37:54.071
You were itching
for a fight from the start.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.545
When you're invited into someone's house,

38:01.581 --> 38:03.246
you show respect for their beliefs.

38:03.282 --> 38:05.148
It's just basic decency.

38:05.184 --> 38:07.650
What gives you the right
to share my trauma?

38:07.686 --> 38:10.087
- Huh? Does he know about my scars?
- Stop it.

38:10.122 --> 38:12.422
Stop it! You dishonored me.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.895
I didn't mean to hurt you.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.298
- Him, I don't care about.
- You should care.

38:22.826 --> 38:24.266
Navid looks up to Imam Chuck

38:24.302 --> 38:26.168
in a way that he doesn't look up to you,

because you won't let anyone in.

of you soon, I hope.

Thank you, Mrs. Shokrani.

- She's a lawyer with the ACLU.

40:13.107 --> 40:14.639
She works mainly with refugees.

40:14.675 --> 40:16.809
She speaks like five different languages.

40:16.844 --> 40:19.511
Whoa. So, wait.

40:19.546 --> 40:22.247
Is your dad a shrink?

40:22.282 --> 40:24.382
I think he's treating my brother.

40:24.418 --> 40:27.452
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
He treats half of Portland.

40:27.487 --> 40:29.688
So, are you Arab or...?

40:29.723 --> 40:33.891
Oh, my dad's from Iran and my mom's
Palestinian, but she was born here.

40:33.927 --> 40:36.194
That's fucking impressive.

40:36.230 --> 40:38.162
Okay, so.

- "My Portland."
- Uh, don't be ridiculous.

What's with the Cover Girl?

40:44.003 --> 40:46.070

- Hijab.

40:46.106 --> 40:47.837
Well, what are you?

40:47.873 --> 40:50.473
I mean, who are you?

40:51.344 --> 40:53.144
- Gender fluid.
- Oh my God, I wish I was.

40:53.179 --> 40:55.546
- But not at school.
- Yeah, well, that's injustice, though.

40:55.581 --> 40:56.980
It's not safe.

40:57.015 --> 40:58.482
Okay, I'm not gonna tell anyone, but...

40:58.517 --> 41:00.251
I mean, you're... you're a Muslim.

41:00.286 --> 41:01.785
How is that okay?

41:01.820 --> 41:02.953
And wait, do your parents know?

41:02.988 --> 41:05.021
What about your dad? Oh,
he's a... he's a shrink, so...

41:05.057 --> 41:07.858
- Do I get to talk?
- Sorry, I'm just... I'm all jacked up!

when almost nothing is!

Okay.

41:14.967 --> 41:16.933
As long as I don't have sex with men.

Um, so, are you, like, a real Muslim?

41:25.258 --> 41:26.276
What does that mean?

41:26.311 --> 41:28.511
You know how, like,
some people go to church,

41:28.546 --> 41:30.146
but they don't believe in anything?

41:30.181 --> 41:32.181
Uh, I believe. I'm a real one.

41:32.216 --> 41:34.250
Yeah, but not like a Republican Muslim.

41:34.286 --> 41:36.886

what to do with their religion.

in Seattle last month.

41:50.700 --> 41:52.652
Not too scared.

41:52.687 --> 41:54.469
Some men came to our mosque once.

41:54.505 --> 41:56.471
They were drunk,

41:56.507 --> 41:59.141
and shouting and waving signs.

42:00.644 --> 42:02.570

42:06.850 --> 42:08.116

42:08.151 --> 42:10.803
You know, we didn't ask them for
help or anything, they just...

42:11.355 --> 42:13.177
- did it on their own.
- Okay.
