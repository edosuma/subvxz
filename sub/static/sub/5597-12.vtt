WEBVTT

00:00.958 --> 00:02.794
Do you want to come look
at the flowers?

00:02.844 --> 00:04.844
Mommy got flowers for Aunt Dana.

00:04.846 --> 00:06.078
Do you want to see?

00:07.281 --> 00:08.648
Not a good idea. Okay.

00:08.650 --> 00:09.882
Oh, he is so tired.

00:09.884 --> 00:10.883
Someone is cranky.

00:10.885 --> 00:12.383
I have this little trick.

00:12.385 --> 00:14.385
I have tricks, too. Just be patient.

00:14.387 --> 00:16.120
He's, you know, hungry, tired.

00:16.122 --> 00:17.923
Yeah. Okay. I'll get our stuff.

00:17.925 --> 00:19.991
Hey, what happened to the food I made?

00:19.993 --> 00:21.560
The peas and the broccoli?

00:21.562 --> 00:23.895
Oh, he's just...
he's really into squash right now.

00:23.897 --> 00:25.329
It's organic. It's store-bought.

00:25.331 --> 00:26.531
You know what, it's fine.

00:26.533 --> 00:28.832
I've just got to remember...
peas gone, squash is in.

00:28.834 --> 00:30.701
Baby, we got to go. "Peas" and thank you.

00:30.703 --> 00:32.134
I'm so sorry.

00:32.137 --> 00:34.038
Okay, let me take you.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.040
Let me take you.

00:36.042 --> 00:38.542
Mommy's got to go to work.

00:38.544 --> 00:40.844
I know.

00:40.846 --> 00:42.512
Okay. Bye-bye.

00:45.249 --> 00:48.217
Surprise.

00:48.219 --> 00:49.318
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.721
So, is this a six-month
anniversary surprise?

00:53.324 --> 00:55.424
No, it isn't.

00:55.426 --> 00:56.960
- Because you didn't know.
- I did.

00:57.895 --> 01:00.730
I just wanted to make sure you
were ready for some of this.

01:02.866 --> 01:04.032
I'll help you.

01:04.034 --> 01:06.034
No, no, I'm okay... ooh!

01:06.536 --> 01:07.535
Dr. Miller.

01:07.537 --> 01:08.803
Is leaving.

01:12.475 --> 01:14.509
You're too skinny.

01:15.544 --> 01:19.280
You jewish-mothering me or
ex-girlfriending me right now?

01:19.282 --> 01:20.880
I didn't know we were exes.

01:20.882 --> 01:22.349
Not really just friends, either.

01:22.351 --> 01:24.084
Fair enough.

01:24.086 --> 01:26.253
You're back so soon after the accident.

01:26.255 --> 01:27.454
You sure you're okay to work?

01:27.456 --> 01:28.573
I'd rather be here with a headache

01:28.623 --> 01:29.924
than surfing daytime television.

01:29.974 --> 01:31.325
All right. Come meet my patient.

01:31.327 --> 01:34.151
I want to place her with someone
I trust before I go to Israel.

01:34.201 --> 01:35.296
You trust me that much?

01:35.298 --> 01:37.918
Well, I could refer her to
Dr. Gill at the general if you prefer.

01:37.968 --> 01:39.498
No, leave her with me.

01:40.571 --> 01:42.322
So, Tel Aviv.

01:42.734 --> 01:44.351
- Big move.
- It is.

01:44.401 --> 01:45.438
Sure it's the right one?

01:46.259 --> 01:47.168
There's a saying...

01:47.218 --> 01:48.842
if you don't know what you're living for,

01:48.844 --> 01:50.076
you haven't lived yet.

01:50.078 --> 01:52.745
So much has changed for me.

01:52.747 --> 01:55.113
You know that. You were there.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.316
Still here.

01:57.976 --> 02:01.186
Eat something, then meet me on the ward.

02:05.358 --> 02:06.401
Oh!

02:06.845 --> 02:08.441
There you are, sweetheart.

02:08.548 --> 02:11.128
Aww, the only one I care about seeing.

02:11.130 --> 02:13.032
Mm. How are you? Crap.

02:13.471 --> 02:14.685
No, the opposite, actually.

02:14.735 --> 02:15.640
No, I got you flowers.

02:15.690 --> 02:16.734
I forgot them upstairs. Damn it.

02:16.878 --> 02:18.808
Ah, you still get the good karma points.

02:18.858 --> 02:19.797
Oh, Alex.

02:20.716 --> 02:22.013
So, how was Paris?

02:22.063 --> 02:25.676
Oh, Alex, the things I did in Paris.

02:25.678 --> 02:27.378
- I bet.
- Oh.

02:27.380 --> 02:28.504
But now that you're home,

02:28.554 --> 02:30.849
you're back on track with your chemo?

02:31.049 --> 02:33.216
Dana, you have been in to see Stroman?

02:33.218 --> 02:36.152
I mean, oncology is slammed,
but he would make time for you.

02:36.154 --> 02:37.553
Okay, enough about that.

02:37.555 --> 02:39.756
Show me pictures of my delightful godson.

02:39.758 --> 02:41.057
Okay.

02:42.594 --> 02:45.160
English, please, so they can
all hear what an ass you are!

02:45.162 --> 02:47.662
Alex, you just won yourself
a shiny new medical consult.

02:47.664 --> 02:49.398
I'm tapping out.

02:57.073 --> 02:58.307
Morning, Dr. Harris.

02:58.309 --> 02:59.375
Dr. Mirani.

02:59.377 --> 03:02.176
Ready to start
your ortho rotation today?

03:02.178 --> 03:03.577
I am. Yeah.

03:03.579 --> 03:05.146
Very excited.

03:05.148 --> 03:07.315
Wow. That was unconvincing.

03:07.317 --> 03:11.386
Let me guess... you think that
orthopedics is a boys' club,

03:11.388 --> 03:12.887
glorified carpentry,

03:12.889 --> 03:15.023
all bones and power tools
and no real medicine, right?

03:15.025 --> 03:17.091
No. No, not at all.

03:17.093 --> 03:18.526
Well, let's see if we can
change your mind today.

03:18.528 --> 03:22.229
Because bones are literally
what holds it all together.

03:22.231 --> 03:23.563
Charlie, incoming.

03:23.565 --> 03:27.034
Margot Kay... she took a
bad fall from a treehouse.

03:27.036 --> 03:28.868
She's hypotensive with blunt trauma.

03:28.870 --> 03:30.603
Somebody's got to get my kids from school.

03:30.605 --> 03:31.871
Okay, 1, 2, 3.

03:31.873 --> 03:33.873
Peter has hockey. Henry has judo.

03:33.875 --> 03:37.576
S-saul has homework club.
There's five of them.

03:37.578 --> 03:38.911
Uh, can we reach your husband?

03:38.913 --> 03:41.447
He took off. There's just us.

03:41.449 --> 03:42.915
Okay, based on her vitals,

03:42.917 --> 03:45.051
I'd say a 30% to 35% loss of blood volume.

03:45.053 --> 03:46.419
Grade III hemorrhagic shock.

03:46.421 --> 03:49.088
I need two units
of unmatched O-neg blood, stat,

03:49.090 --> 03:51.723
and push 2,000 cc of ringer's
lactate through the level I.

03:51.725 --> 03:54.125
Dr. Mirani, given her state,
what should I be looking for?

03:55.092 --> 03:56.127
Uh...

03:56.129 --> 03:58.563
- An unstable pelvic fracture.
- Uh, I was gonna say that.

03:58.565 --> 04:00.898
- Yeah? Say it faster next time.
- Yep.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.133
Pelvis is grossly unstable.

04:02.135 --> 04:04.535
Okay, no more hands on her
till we get her to imaging.

04:04.537 --> 04:05.870
Big arteries running through there...

04:05.872 --> 04:07.105
any bone fragments nick one and...

04:07.107 --> 04:08.473
She's in big trouble. I'll get a binder.

04:08.475 --> 04:11.108
Still think ortho's boring?

04:11.110 --> 04:14.044
This isn't gonna be easy, is it?

04:14.046 --> 04:15.479
Is this heaven?

04:18.550 --> 04:20.649
Nope, it isn't.

04:28.223 --> 04:30.973
Okay, let's maintain pelvic
and C-spine stability.

04:31.023 --> 04:33.128
Should we be getting someone
to check in on her kids?

04:33.178 --> 04:35.851
Let's just focus on keeping
her alive for now, shall we?

04:35.853 --> 04:37.753
I'm all they've got!

04:37.755 --> 04:39.388
Well, Julia, my eldest,

04:39.390 --> 04:40.889
but she can't even fold her laundry right.

04:40.891 --> 04:44.459
We'll, uh, call her kids'
school, but for now,

04:44.461 --> 04:46.160
we need this binder to avoid displacement

04:46.162 --> 04:48.329
and further bleeding.

04:48.331 --> 04:50.865
If there's bleeding,
there's potential pressure necrosis.

04:50.867 --> 04:52.199
That's very good, doctor.

04:52.201 --> 04:53.634
- Vitals are stable.
- Great.

04:53.636 --> 04:55.736
Let's get her
to imaging, guys. Let's go.

04:55.738 --> 04:58.639
Have you been under a lot of stress lately?

04:58.641 --> 05:00.374
He works 20 hours a day, 7 days a week.

05:00.376 --> 05:01.876
It's my grand opening in a week.

05:01.878 --> 05:03.411
Don't forget to call the butcher.

05:03.413 --> 05:05.979
Any unusual symptoms? Do you have pain?

05:05.981 --> 05:07.914
Night sweats, weight loss?

05:07.916 --> 05:09.148
He stopped eating.

05:09.150 --> 05:11.150
- I eat.
- You taste.

05:11.152 --> 05:12.552
You don't eat.

05:12.554 --> 05:16.055
Does it hurt when you swallow?

05:16.057 --> 05:17.390
Do you smoke?

05:17.392 --> 05:18.725
Drink?

05:18.727 --> 05:20.660
Lady, I'm a chef.

05:20.662 --> 05:22.094
It's not "lady." It's "doctor."

05:22.096 --> 05:23.830
And the glands on the left
side of your neck are swollen.

05:23.832 --> 05:24.863
It doesn't hurt.

05:24.865 --> 05:26.665
I feel fine. Are you happy?

05:27.735 --> 05:29.134
Okay, I'd like to start with imaging

05:29.136 --> 05:31.503
to get a clear scan of your
throat and chest, all right?

05:31.505 --> 05:33.204
Can't do it. I got to go.

05:33.206 --> 05:35.106
My kitchen needs its captain.

05:35.108 --> 05:37.876
A sick captain is no use to anyone.

05:40.180 --> 05:42.179
Good to have you back, Dr. Lin.

05:42.181 --> 05:43.180
Thanks.

05:43.182 --> 05:44.682
Mm, they've missed you.

05:44.684 --> 05:46.016
I have, too.

05:46.018 --> 05:49.353
So, apart from getting blown up,
what else has been going on?

05:49.355 --> 05:51.656
Lots. I, uh, almost got a new job.

05:51.658 --> 05:53.624
I almost moved to Cleveland.

05:53.626 --> 05:55.192
Oh. That's a long list of almosts.

05:55.194 --> 05:56.461
What about you?

05:56.463 --> 05:59.563
Has your life been a flurry
of hot dates and deliveries?

05:59.565 --> 06:01.297
No, not exactly.

06:01.299 --> 06:03.366
My father still won't speak to me,

06:03.368 --> 06:06.369
but my mom started sending e-mail,
so that's progress.

06:06.371 --> 06:07.537
I'm glad.

06:07.539 --> 06:09.372
Have you talked to Herschel?

06:09.374 --> 06:11.942
No. No, that's a burned bridge.

06:11.944 --> 06:14.644
We're safer talking about Nicola.

06:14.646 --> 06:16.612
You ever had one of those patients

06:16.614 --> 06:17.880
who, you know, they just...

06:17.882 --> 06:18.981
Get to you?

06:18.983 --> 06:21.316
- Mm-hmm.
- Nicola's one of those.

06:21.318 --> 06:24.587
She's had three miscarriages
before this pregnancy.

06:24.589 --> 06:26.188
If she means that much to you,

06:26.190 --> 06:27.923
why don't you postpone your move?

06:27.925 --> 06:29.992
Because I'm moving to Israel
to be with my girlfriend,

06:29.994 --> 06:31.393
and she's expecting me next week.

06:33.395 --> 06:35.329
- Hello.
- Dr. Katz.

06:35.331 --> 06:38.265
I bought you some goodbye pastries,

06:38.267 --> 06:40.602
but I'm ashamed to admit
I ate them all on the way in.

06:41.671 --> 06:43.104
I'm just happy your appetite's back.

06:43.106 --> 06:45.573
- Although my colleague here
could have used one.
- Hi.

06:45.575 --> 06:48.510
I'm Dr. Lin, and FYI,
I always like a good pastry.

06:48.512 --> 06:50.243
Nice to meet you, Dr. Lin.

06:50.245 --> 06:52.646
I can't believe I made it this far.

06:52.648 --> 06:54.080
20 weeks. I know.

06:54.082 --> 06:55.181
Baruch hashem.

06:55.183 --> 06:57.083
So, during today's exam,

06:57.085 --> 06:59.185
Dr. Lin will start with a
full anatomy ultrasound.

06:59.187 --> 07:01.616
And boy or girl? Can I find out?

07:01.666 --> 07:04.297
Oh, I thought you and David
wanted it to be a surprise?

07:05.159 --> 07:06.259
It's more me.

07:06.261 --> 07:08.661
I-I can't stand calling it
"peanut" any longer.

07:09.664 --> 07:12.197
I'm gonna do a full anatomy scan

07:12.199 --> 07:13.866
as soon as I've had a
little feel of your tummy.

07:15.837 --> 07:17.970
So, how's your prenatal class going?

07:17.972 --> 07:19.204
Grand.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.707
One blind mom told me
she tied bells to her son's feet

07:21.709 --> 07:23.475
when he started crawling.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.043
Oh, that's clever.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.712
I do wish I could see my baby.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.648
If only for a moment.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.782
Dr. Katz?

07:31.717 --> 07:34.485
There's some slight dilation.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.154
What does that mean?

07:39.922 --> 07:41.224
Oh, that doesn't look like good news.

07:41.226 --> 07:42.885
- Is that your chef?
- Mm-hmm.

07:43.012 --> 07:44.588
Hodgkin's, maybe lymphoma.

07:44.638 --> 07:46.399
I'll have to do a biopsy to be sure.

07:46.462 --> 07:48.597
- But he's showing all the symptoms.
- Yeah.

07:48.647 --> 07:50.522
He should have come in sooner.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.971
Well, people deal with these
things in their own way.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.173
As long as they are dealing with them.

07:56.175 --> 07:59.375
I am, Alex. I am dealing with it.

08:00.978 --> 08:03.680
Look, I'm not paying for
tired-looking produce.

08:03.682 --> 08:05.314
I saw it wilt with my own eyes.

08:05.316 --> 08:06.382
I'll call you later.

08:08.264 --> 08:10.019
The minute you turn your back.

08:10.021 --> 08:12.755
Mr. Feschado, I have some preliminary
results that we should talk about.

08:12.757 --> 08:14.390
I don't think I want to hear this.

08:14.392 --> 08:14.978
No, no, no.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.825
You promised you'd stay until we knew.

08:16.827 --> 08:18.860
And you promised you would...

08:18.862 --> 08:20.462
Let's have a look again.

08:20.464 --> 08:22.405
Get up on the table. Help me, please.

08:24.001 --> 08:26.534
It's nothing. It's just...

08:26.536 --> 08:28.303
Let me be the judge of that. Open.

08:29.154 --> 08:31.267
Other side,
tongue to the left, please.

08:31.317 --> 08:32.206
Stick it out.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.809
Yeah, I do not like the look of that lesion.

08:35.812 --> 08:39.413
It's just... it's just a canker sore.

08:39.414 --> 08:42.950
Well, just to be sure,
I need to do a biopsy.

08:47.300 --> 08:50.824
Hey, Charlie.

08:51.083 --> 08:54.224
Did you, um, did you get my message?

08:54.521 --> 08:57.824
Busy morning.

08:57.933 --> 09:00.700
Yeah, busy few weeks.

09:02.070 --> 09:03.737
Take it easy, yeah?

09:07.874 --> 09:10.976
Uh, Charlie,
can I talk to you for a minute?

09:10.978 --> 09:13.545
Look, I... I'm not gonna lie.

09:13.547 --> 09:15.814
I'm starting to feel like
a bit of a wet blanket.

09:15.816 --> 09:18.784
Our talks have really helped me a lot.

09:18.786 --> 09:20.585
Me, too.

09:21.947 --> 09:24.221
You know, I-I never thought
I would find someone

09:24.223 --> 09:26.457
to share this with.

09:26.459 --> 09:28.225
And I don't want to lose that.

09:28.227 --> 09:29.360
I know.

09:30.764 --> 09:34.132
We need to talk about what
happened at my place with Cora.

09:34.134 --> 09:37.336
Don't tell me you haven't thought about it.

09:37.537 --> 09:40.070
Look, I'm off tonight.

09:40.072 --> 09:41.705
Let me... let me buy you a cup of coffee.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.239
Maybe we can figure out what it means.

09:44.442 --> 09:46.043
Two minds are better than one.

09:50.082 --> 09:51.581
Okay. Okay.

09:53.378 --> 09:55.062
I'll talk to you later.

09:55.216 --> 09:55.716
Perfect.

09:59.463 --> 10:02.398
Let that freezing kick in, all right?

10:03.024 --> 10:04.160
What kind of food do you cook?

10:04.862 --> 10:06.796
Traditional portuguese cuisine.

10:06.798 --> 10:09.498
My son sends everything I make back,
and he's not even 2.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.967
Let me guess... vegetable purée?

10:11.969 --> 10:12.883
Bland.

10:13.259 --> 10:14.851
- Yeah.
- Try...

10:14.942 --> 10:16.116
try alternating his greens

10:16.166 --> 10:17.839
with apricots and peaches.

10:17.841 --> 10:18.873
He'll come around.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.304
But if you can't make a basic purée...

10:21.577 --> 10:22.791
There's no hope for you.

10:22.841 --> 10:25.106
Open up.

10:25.954 --> 10:27.344
Feel that?

10:28.006 --> 10:29.262
Okay.

10:29.899 --> 10:31.335
She's a good friend.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.992
She's a loudmouth.

10:34.043 --> 10:35.282
She's trouble.

10:35.829 --> 10:38.782
But, uh, she's the best thing
to happen to my kitchen.

10:39.690 --> 10:41.247
She's my gut-check.

10:41.711 --> 10:42.996
I like that.

10:42.998 --> 10:44.674
Your gut-check.

10:45.201 --> 10:46.867
You ready?

10:46.869 --> 10:48.434
We're gonna need a large sample.

10:48.436 --> 10:50.837
If this is the tumor that
spread to your lymph nodes,

10:50.839 --> 10:53.840
we're gonna have to start
treatment right away.

10:53.842 --> 10:54.974
You're welcome.

10:54.976 --> 10:57.009
- Dr. Miller, I wanted to...
- Williams.

10:57.011 --> 10:59.746
Important safety tip...
never lap-dance in a swivel chair

10:59.748 --> 11:01.413
until you've locked the wheels.

11:01.415 --> 11:02.616
I want to set the record straight

11:02.666 --> 11:03.681
- about this morning.
- I don't.

11:03.684 --> 11:05.083
Dev and I just hit the six-month mark,

11:05.085 --> 11:06.384
and we're sort of celebrating.

11:06.386 --> 11:08.553
Six months? Wow. What is that...
is that chrome or paper?

11:08.555 --> 11:10.789
Or no, wait, it's nothing
because it's meaningless.

11:10.791 --> 11:12.090
When your boyfriend works 80 hours

11:12.092 --> 11:13.524
and still has time to buy you flowers,

11:13.526 --> 11:14.760
it should be a major milestone.

11:14.762 --> 11:17.595
What, do you have a
hate-on for happy couples?

11:17.597 --> 11:19.364
Yes. Yes, I do.

11:19.366 --> 11:20.966
Cue door number one. What happened?

11:20.968 --> 11:23.033
We were on our way to the
church to get married!

11:23.035 --> 11:24.601
Cole couldn't breathe, and he fell!

11:24.603 --> 11:26.937
- I can't feel my legs.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, okay.

11:26.939 --> 11:29.306
It's called an incompetent cervix.

11:29.308 --> 11:31.375
That sounds like a bad joke.

11:31.377 --> 11:33.410
It means your cervix

11:33.412 --> 11:36.013
is prematurely shortening and opening,

11:36.015 --> 11:39.715
which is welcome activity
around nine months of pregnancy,

11:39.717 --> 11:41.785
but at five, it's a problem.

11:41.787 --> 11:43.820
I'd go into premature labor.

11:43.822 --> 11:45.121
I'd lose the baby.

11:45.123 --> 11:46.823
Well, we have options.

11:46.825 --> 11:49.458
Dr. Lin could administer a rescue cerclage.

11:49.460 --> 11:51.327
I would stitch the cervix closed,

11:51.329 --> 11:54.063
protect the baby, and save the pregnancy.

11:54.065 --> 11:57.065
You really shouldn't be alone today.
Is someone here with you?

11:57.067 --> 11:58.733
Ben. My brother-in-law.

11:58.735 --> 11:59.935
He's waiting.

11:59.937 --> 12:02.204
Okay, good. And where can
we reach your husband?

12:03.739 --> 12:05.941
Nicola, where's David?

12:08.126 --> 12:10.368
David died two months ago.

12:10.926 --> 12:12.647
Nicola, I'm so sorry.

12:13.608 --> 12:14.515
I had no idea.

12:14.517 --> 12:16.284
You wouldn't.

12:16.286 --> 12:18.585
Condolences start to sound so phony.

12:18.587 --> 12:20.822
I stopped telling people.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.291
I'm trying really hard to...

12:25.928 --> 12:27.428
to just be a mom.

12:28.466 --> 12:29.830
This is all I have left of him.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.764
I can't lose this baby.

12:31.766 --> 12:33.033
I won't.

12:33.035 --> 12:36.602
Do you understand me?

12:36.604 --> 12:38.604
I do.

12:38.606 --> 12:40.340
Your legs... is it more of a tingle,

12:40.342 --> 12:42.508
a numbness,
above or below the knee?

12:42.510 --> 12:43.944
Can I pick all of the above?

12:44.979 --> 12:46.546
Circulation's been compromised.

12:46.548 --> 12:48.848
- Looks a little pale.
- Help him, please.

12:48.850 --> 12:51.650
All right, let's, uh,
let's take a look at what we got here.

12:51.652 --> 12:52.651
No!

12:52.653 --> 12:54.486
Uh, not the suit.

12:54.488 --> 12:55.389
It's a rental.

12:55.439 --> 12:58.194
Well, prepare to lose the deposit.

13:04.230 --> 13:06.597
Oh, my god. Cole, are those...

13:11.697 --> 13:13.738
You wear nudes for dudes?

13:13.740 --> 13:15.639
It's not what it looks like.

13:15.641 --> 13:17.641
Uh...

13:17.643 --> 13:20.044
Patient's finally stable.
Saw a potential bladder injury.

13:20.046 --> 13:20.768
Yeah, blah-blah-blah.

13:20.818 --> 13:22.166
Skip to the fun part. The bones!

13:22.216 --> 13:22.986
Uh, right.

13:23.036 --> 13:25.582
CT reveals three broken
points on Margot's pelvis,

13:25.632 --> 13:27.499
2.2 centimeters between the bone.

13:27.549 --> 13:28.385
Yep,
definite compression injury.

13:28.387 --> 13:30.420
She's gonna need an ex-fix
to immobilize the fracture

13:30.422 --> 13:31.554
and limit the bleed.

13:31.556 --> 13:33.523
You mean it will tamponade the venous bleed?

13:33.879 --> 13:36.360
That's very impressive, doctor.
You do know your ortho.

13:36.362 --> 13:39.328
I want to apologize about before.

13:39.330 --> 13:41.630
It's not that I don't respect ortho.

13:41.632 --> 13:43.165
I do. I'm just, um...

13:43.167 --> 13:45.467
I'm struggling to find my specialty.

13:45.469 --> 13:47.270
I'm struggling in general.

13:47.272 --> 13:48.905
That's not what I hear.

13:48.907 --> 13:50.940
Oh, about me? What do you hear?

13:50.942 --> 13:52.741
That you're very conscientious,
obsessive, even,

13:52.743 --> 13:54.377
one of our most promising young residents.

13:54.995 --> 13:56.111
And about Lane and I...

13:56.113 --> 13:59.047
I don't want to hear
about that piece of sh...

13:59.049 --> 14:00.485
unless you want to talk about it?

14:00.535 --> 14:02.550
No. No, not necessary.

14:02.552 --> 14:04.052
Good, then. Well, back to business.

14:04.054 --> 14:06.354
Back to bones, which I know is
your sole obsession for the day

14:06.356 --> 14:07.599
as much as it is mine,

14:07.649 --> 14:09.624
so why don't you go in there,
book an O.R. for our patient,

14:09.626 --> 14:10.992
and I will see what you've got.

14:14.796 --> 14:15.862
Okay.

14:15.864 --> 14:18.265
That should do it with the stitches.

14:18.267 --> 14:21.001
The tissue sample is with pathology,

14:21.003 --> 14:23.404
and once we have the results...

14:23.406 --> 14:24.704
And if it's...

14:24.706 --> 14:26.307
We don't want to jump to conclusions,

14:26.309 --> 14:27.507
but if it is oral cancer,

14:27.509 --> 14:29.309
we'll need to be aggressive with treatment.

14:29.311 --> 14:30.977
Chemotherapy?

14:30.979 --> 14:32.478
Surgery.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.081
We would do a neck dissection
to take the diseased lymph node

14:35.083 --> 14:36.149
out of your neck.

14:36.151 --> 14:38.084
I would then involve plastics,

14:38.086 --> 14:41.087
and we would plan on a partial glossectomy.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.957
Which means we would have to
remove part of your tongue.

14:47.127 --> 14:48.593
Cut out my tongue?

14:48.595 --> 14:49.627
Yes.

14:49.629 --> 14:51.029
That would be
my strongest recommendation.

14:51.031 --> 14:52.965
It is the best way to cure this thing.

14:59.176 --> 15:01.144
I'm just gonna mark the spots for the pins

15:01.146 --> 15:03.412
along the gluteus medius pillar.

15:03.414 --> 15:05.982
That's always the best
place to anchor an ex-fix?

15:05.984 --> 15:07.483
It's the strongest part of the bone.

15:08.097 --> 15:10.318
Any bone fragments
nick the nearby arteries,

15:10.320 --> 15:12.354
and she's bleeding out again.

15:12.356 --> 15:14.990
Do kids even play in treehouses anymore?

15:14.992 --> 15:16.424
Hers better. Nearly cost her her life.

15:19.829 --> 15:21.830
Pressure's all over the map.

15:21.832 --> 15:24.533
She's going hypotensive again.

15:26.502 --> 15:27.869
Carolyn, bolus.

15:29.939 --> 15:33.307
My kids. Who'll take them if I die?

15:38.716 --> 15:39.714
Nic?

15:42.237 --> 15:44.681
- Ben.
- It's gonna be okay.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.654
The first step is an amniocentesis.

15:48.309 --> 15:50.664
No. No, no, no, no, no.

15:50.714 --> 15:51.369
Doctor Katz...

15:51.419 --> 15:53.326
Now, Nicola, I know your last amnio...

15:53.328 --> 15:55.962
It cost me my pregnancy. It did.

15:55.964 --> 15:58.065
You said the cerclage itself carries risks.

15:58.067 --> 15:59.965
Adding another procedure on top of that

15:59.967 --> 16:01.734
feels like I'm doubling the chances

16:01.736 --> 16:03.335
of something going wrong.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.337
Yes, the amnio could induce labor.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.039
And I'd miscarry before we got a chance

16:07.041 --> 16:09.875
to even try the cerclage. No.

16:10.059 --> 16:12.311
I want the absolute minimum interference.

16:12.313 --> 16:14.446
We have to rule out an underlying infection,

16:14.448 --> 16:16.480
which could cause your tissues to weaken.

16:17.934 --> 16:19.179
Syd, please.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.997
If no test is what she wants,

16:21.047 --> 16:23.121
then you should respect her wishes.

16:23.761 --> 16:24.886
Okay.

16:25.733 --> 16:27.058
Right now, you're clinically stable

16:27.060 --> 16:29.828
with no troubling symptoms,
and you're not in active labor.

16:29.830 --> 16:33.063
So why would I risk this when you don't
even know if I have an infection?

16:33.065 --> 16:35.199
Because we don't know that you don't.

16:35.201 --> 16:37.701
And if it's missed,
you risk maternal sepsis.

16:37.703 --> 16:39.336
You're telling me she could die?

16:43.637 --> 16:45.776
Maybe you should do the amnio.

16:47.610 --> 16:49.373
Whose side are you on?

16:49.432 --> 16:51.580
I'm on your side. It doesn't feel that way.

16:53.085 --> 16:54.152
I'll-I'll bring you some water.

16:54.202 --> 16:55.752
I don't want water. I...

16:58.396 --> 16:59.956
I want help.

17:01.747 --> 17:02.963
I want David.

17:03.066 --> 17:04.167
I know.

17:04.366 --> 17:06.181
I'm-I'm trying my best,

17:06.231 --> 17:08.964
- but I...
- You're not him.

17:09.978 --> 17:11.733
No, I'm not.

17:13.000 --> 17:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:20.028 --> 17:21.709
Ben. Ben.

17:21.711 --> 17:24.377
It's best for everyone
if I blast out of here, trust me.

17:24.380 --> 17:26.413
I shouldn't have moved in
and taken over for David.

17:26.415 --> 17:27.848
Your brother would be proud

17:27.849 --> 17:30.084
- of how you're taking care of your fam...
- You don't get it.

17:31.619 --> 17:33.620
I'm in love with her.

17:35.792 --> 17:38.058
What kind of person would let that happen?

17:38.060 --> 17:42.428
With his dead brother's wife.

17:45.333 --> 17:46.766
- Nudes for dudes.
- Okay.

17:46.768 --> 17:48.835
These fluids are going to hydrate

17:48.837 --> 17:50.503
your pressed muscle fibers in your legs.

17:50.505 --> 17:51.905
Nudes for dudes...
for the look that eludes.

17:51.907 --> 17:52.906
Ma'am...

17:52.908 --> 17:54.373
Mika, please stop with the slogan.

17:54.375 --> 17:56.442
And we're getting married.
secrets between us just aren't right.

17:56.444 --> 17:57.743
Nothing about this has been right.

17:57.745 --> 17:58.840
- Okay...
- What's that supposed to mean?

17:58.890 --> 17:59.912
- Guys.
- I thought you wanted...

17:59.914 --> 18:01.472
I wanted to drop 80 grand on,

18:01.522 --> 18:02.314
- and I quote, "a world-class event"?
- 80 grand?!

18:02.316 --> 18:04.449
- 80 grand?
- You work hard!

18:04.451 --> 18:06.018
Why can't we spend a little money?

18:06.020 --> 18:07.286
You know what?

18:07.929 --> 18:10.214
- I love you, but I'm nearly naked...
- Folks...

18:10.264 --> 18:13.206
In an E.R. on my wedding
day 'cause you think I'm fat.

18:13.256 --> 18:14.259
Don't deny it.

18:14.326 --> 18:16.045
Diet books, exercise plans.

18:16.148 --> 18:18.193
I couldn't keep up
with who you wanted me to be.

18:18.243 --> 18:18.875
Great, that's it.

18:18.925 --> 18:19.964
Can I just get out of here?

18:19.966 --> 18:21.498
Whoa, whoa!

18:21.500 --> 18:23.172
Sir, sir, please don't move. Don't move.

18:23.222 --> 18:23.968
You kids are skipping

18:23.970 --> 18:25.669
right to the sickness and health part, huh?

18:29.374 --> 18:30.574
Ding-dong.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.175
Hey, Miss Amari, the liver
transplant from yesterday?

18:32.177 --> 18:33.776
- Yeah.
- Those numbers look right?

18:33.778 --> 18:35.812
Yeah, she should normalize in a day or two.

18:35.814 --> 18:37.313
Still, I'd keep an eye on her.

18:37.315 --> 18:38.587
Thanks. What are you working on?

18:38.637 --> 18:41.325
A stage 3B squamous cell
carcinoma of the tongue.

18:41.375 --> 18:44.002
- He's a chef.
- Ooh, tough luck. How'd he take it?

18:44.121 --> 18:45.655
We'll see. I'm waiting on Dr. Storms.

18:45.657 --> 18:46.889
Storms?

18:46.891 --> 18:48.019
I don't know him. Is he...

18:48.069 --> 18:49.544
A second-rate surgeon?

18:49.594 --> 18:50.950
Yeah. He is.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.227
You paged another plastics

18:52.229 --> 18:53.600
when you knew I was in the hospital.

18:53.822 --> 18:54.998
What the hell, Alex?

18:56.400 --> 18:57.220
Come on, let's go.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.375
You can brief me on the way.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.871
Chef needed a minute.

19:02.873 --> 19:04.973
He's freaking out.

19:07.008 --> 19:09.176
You have to do something.

19:09.603 --> 19:11.947
In other kitchens, I'm eye candy,

19:12.007 --> 19:14.526
but chef made me his equal.

19:14.696 --> 19:15.798
He gave me a chance.

19:15.848 --> 19:17.374
I want him to have one.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.219
Do you think he left the hospital?

19:19.307 --> 19:22.737
No. I'm his ride.

19:23.149 --> 19:24.257
Is he religious?

19:24.259 --> 19:26.393
Maybe he's in our chapel.

19:26.395 --> 19:28.561
What do you think, Fiona?

19:30.698 --> 19:32.699
You got a kitchen?

19:32.934 --> 19:35.502
That's his chapel.

19:41.311 --> 19:43.108
B.P. is crashing.

19:43.110 --> 19:46.978
I need blood and pressors, stat.

19:46.980 --> 19:48.647
Okay, something's wrong.

19:48.649 --> 19:50.215
Is it bile?

19:50.217 --> 19:52.484
Is it... is it bowels?

19:52.486 --> 19:53.485
Fast was clear.

19:53.487 --> 19:55.220
Dr. Bishop reported no punctures.

19:55.222 --> 19:57.922
You missed a contrast blush, Dr. Mirani.

19:57.924 --> 19:59.123
I what?

19:59.125 --> 20:01.324
Contrast blush in the
superior gluteal artery...

20:01.374 --> 20:02.393
you missed a bleed.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.229
S.G.A bleed will cause
bruising on the buttocks.

20:05.231 --> 20:06.000
I don't understand.

20:06.050 --> 20:08.531
We're operating as
if it's a venous bleed... it's arterial.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.768
She's bleeding to death.

20:10.900 --> 20:14.238
She should have never
been allowed in the O.R.

20:16.453 --> 20:18.974
I can't believe I missed
that contrast blush.

20:19.024 --> 20:20.499
Look, you know your stuff, okay?

20:20.549 --> 20:21.786
Radiologists are on this,

20:21.836 --> 20:24.424
an embolization coil is being
put in to stop the bleeding. So...

20:24.474 --> 20:25.819
An arterial bleed.

20:25.869 --> 20:27.506
That's my mistake.

20:29.485 --> 20:31.352
Good doctoring isn't a one-person job.

20:31.402 --> 20:32.553
You're part of a team.

20:32.603 --> 20:33.879
And the team caught the issue.

20:33.881 --> 20:35.983
No, Dr. Bishop caught the issue.

20:36.033 --> 20:37.048
You know, lucky for me, right,

20:37.050 --> 20:38.239
because when one person screws up,

20:38.289 --> 20:39.784
the entire team goes down.

20:43.255 --> 20:44.488
I like her.

20:44.490 --> 20:47.124
She's got high standards.

20:48.426 --> 20:49.877
Yeah, surgeons are like that.

20:49.927 --> 20:51.695
I am, too.

20:51.697 --> 20:54.564
Five kids and a job and I never,
ever let them down.

20:54.566 --> 20:56.699
Hey, I can't even imagine.

20:56.701 --> 20:58.314
After their father left,

20:58.629 --> 21:00.743
I didn't want my kids growing up

21:00.793 --> 21:01.982
thinking that they were a burden,

21:02.032 --> 21:04.588
so I made sure they knew
that mom could do it all.

21:04.638 --> 21:09.078
Meals, coaching, homework, shopping.

21:09.128 --> 21:10.912
That's an awful lot to sustain.

21:10.914 --> 21:12.514
Why else am I here if not for them?

21:12.685 --> 21:14.749
Well, you've got to think
about yourself, too.

21:14.751 --> 21:17.286
I mean, what you're doing
for your kids is admirable,

21:17.288 --> 21:21.290
but, um, there's difficulties
and complications.

21:21.292 --> 21:22.857
Mm, accidents.

21:22.859 --> 21:24.449
This is about my treehouse.

21:24.499 --> 21:26.045
You took on a five-person
job all by yourself

21:26.095 --> 21:27.131
and you got five kids.

21:27.181 --> 21:29.897
I mean, why not do it together?

21:29.899 --> 21:30.874
They're not ready for that.

21:30.924 --> 21:34.126
They're children, not laborers.
My oldest is only 16.

21:34.204 --> 21:36.483
Old enough to drive a car,
old enough to swing a hammer,

21:36.533 --> 21:38.075
don't you think?

21:38.241 --> 21:39.340
You have kids?

21:39.342 --> 21:41.070
Uh, I do, actually. I have a son.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.443
You don't see me telling you
how to raise him, do you?

21:43.445 --> 21:46.145
Mind your own business.

21:48.382 --> 21:50.684
You guys skin your tomatoes
when you make your sauce?

21:50.686 --> 21:52.252
All right, I'm gonna
show you a little trick.

21:52.254 --> 21:53.620
Cut the tomato in half.

21:53.622 --> 21:55.589
Grab a grater, right down to the skin.

21:55.591 --> 21:58.725
Prep time goes faster, sauce more flavorful.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.094
Wow.

22:02.096 --> 22:04.563
You guys really clear a room.

22:04.565 --> 22:06.732
This is Dr. Kinney. She's a plastic surgeon.

22:06.734 --> 22:08.267
We had a look at your scans.

22:08.269 --> 22:09.702
Your cancer is treatable.

22:10.928 --> 22:12.845
Will I be able to talk?

22:12.932 --> 22:14.033
Your speech will be affected,

22:14.083 --> 22:15.428
but after reconstruction, your voice,

22:15.478 --> 22:18.616
your ability to swallow...
it will all be restored eventually.

22:18.745 --> 22:20.811
But I won't be able to taste anything.

22:20.813 --> 22:23.781
You will still have your taste,
just in a reduced capacity.

22:23.783 --> 22:26.016
Beethoven was deaf... he still composed.

22:26.018 --> 22:28.052
You can still open your restaurant.

22:28.178 --> 22:30.688
It's not just about the restaurant.

22:33.726 --> 22:35.925
Okay.

22:39.460 --> 22:40.564
That's good.

22:40.566 --> 22:44.200
I worked 20 years in crappy
kitchens to be able to do that.

22:44.202 --> 22:45.469
Look...

22:46.201 --> 22:48.087
Maybe we can try something
else... a different treatment.

22:48.137 --> 22:50.855
Something natural. If that doesn't work...

22:51.143 --> 22:53.589
Tell me, have either of you ever tried fugu?

22:53.707 --> 22:56.511
- Japanese blowfish?
- I can't say that I have.

22:56.514 --> 22:57.747
Oh.

22:57.749 --> 22:59.415
Well, you're missing out.

22:59.417 --> 23:00.449
A true delicacy.

23:00.663 --> 23:02.962
A single dish starts over $200.

23:03.012 --> 23:04.787
You know what makes it so special?

23:04.789 --> 23:07.490
Poison. Worse than cyanide.

23:07.492 --> 23:11.092
And the most poisonous part... the ovaries.

23:11.094 --> 23:13.662
Got to love that.

23:13.664 --> 23:17.766
But people train for years to
be trusted to serve this dish

23:17.768 --> 23:18.369
because one slip,

23:18.440 --> 23:20.809
and it will kill anybody who,
uh, who eats it.

23:20.904 --> 23:24.506
So we're not so different, you and I.

23:24.508 --> 23:26.307
Chefs and surgeons.

23:26.309 --> 23:29.876
Both crafts take mastery and diligence.

23:29.878 --> 23:33.614
A perfect surgery is like a perfect meal.

23:33.616 --> 23:35.749
It's all about the artistry.

23:36.651 --> 23:38.185
Impressive.

23:38.187 --> 23:40.187
If you ever want a job, jump on my line.

23:40.189 --> 23:41.622
Thanks.

23:41.624 --> 23:43.856
But I'm dying.

23:43.858 --> 23:46.726
Faster than you are.

23:46.728 --> 23:48.328
Stage 3 breast cancer.

23:48.330 --> 23:51.130
So I know what it's like to be afraid,

23:51.132 --> 23:53.866
to be so close to the poison.

23:53.868 --> 23:58.103
But I see you in here
teaching people how to cook.

23:58.970 --> 24:00.970
And I know
you're not ready to die yet.

24:01.575 --> 24:03.802
You didn't work 20 years in crappy kitchens

24:03.852 --> 24:06.144
just to give up now.

24:10.520 --> 24:11.383
Hey.

24:11.385 --> 24:12.988
How's our "nudes kid on the block"?

24:13.063 --> 24:15.053
"Orange is the nude black."

24:15.055 --> 24:17.187
"Gangs of Nude York."

24:17.189 --> 24:18.723
Are you kidding me?
I'm giving you gold here.

24:18.725 --> 24:19.979
Inguinal hernia.

24:20.029 --> 24:21.057
He's been lifting weights.

24:21.107 --> 24:22.727
With the added abdominal pressure...

24:22.729 --> 24:24.503
poor guy just wanted to look
good in his wedding photos.

24:24.553 --> 24:26.096
Yeah, well,
that's the cost of love.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.498
It'll get you.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.633
Well, weddings make
even the sane a little nutty.

24:29.635 --> 24:30.934
Don't be too hard on them.

24:30.936 --> 24:32.670
Those two
are never gonna make it.

24:32.672 --> 24:33.740
Why?

24:33.790 --> 24:35.479
Because he's already trying to
be someone different for her,

24:35.529 --> 24:36.918
and that's a recipe for disaster.

24:36.968 --> 24:38.087
He's not trying to be different.

24:38.137 --> 24:41.143
He's trying to be his best self.

24:41.145 --> 24:43.079
Love inspires you.

24:43.081 --> 24:43.758
Hmm.

24:43.808 --> 24:46.249
Or it puts you in tights
and gives you a hernia.

24:47.026 --> 24:49.285
I see right through you, Dr. Miller.

24:49.481 --> 24:51.131
You used to be a romantic.

24:51.181 --> 24:52.662
Then you had your heart broken...

24:52.733 --> 24:54.500
probably more than once.

24:54.759 --> 24:57.348
You know, bitterness suits some people.

24:58.033 --> 25:00.195
But you're not one of them.

25:04.486 --> 25:05.834
Baby's heart rate is 145.

25:05.836 --> 25:07.135
That's good.

25:08.649 --> 25:11.406
He really didn't say anything
else when he rushed out?

25:11.408 --> 25:14.420
Uh, no. Not that I recall.

25:14.713 --> 25:17.906
He's so much more sensitive
than David ever was.

25:18.056 --> 25:19.150
Were they close?

25:19.200 --> 25:20.247
Very.

25:20.790 --> 25:22.717
Ben took David's death hard.

25:22.719 --> 25:25.485
David had been his only ally in that family.

25:26.410 --> 25:28.862
Even I didn't see it at first.

25:28.912 --> 25:30.312
See what?

25:30.492 --> 25:32.784
How much Ben cares

25:33.338 --> 25:35.192
about everyone. He's just...

25:36.127 --> 25:37.394
He's not good at showing it.

25:38.305 --> 25:41.736
Dr. Katz, can you come take
a look at this, please?

25:47.775 --> 25:49.809
What's wrong? is everything okay?

25:53.124 --> 25:55.224
What do prolapsed membranes mean?

25:55.226 --> 25:57.325
It means the membranes are bulging

25:57.327 --> 25:58.993
into your dilated cervix.

25:58.995 --> 26:00.595
We call it hourglassing.

26:00.597 --> 26:02.497
We need to operate.

26:02.499 --> 26:04.432
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This can't be happening.

26:04.434 --> 26:07.935
Hold strong, Nicola. Think of the baby.

26:08.279 --> 26:09.358
If we rupture the membrane,

26:09.408 --> 26:10.838
we essentially terminate
her pregnancy on the spot.

26:10.840 --> 26:11.839
What do you suggest?

26:11.841 --> 26:12.940
Bed rest.

26:12.942 --> 26:14.141
In four weeks,
we can start fetal steroids

26:14.143 --> 26:15.609
and get closer to viable pregnancy

26:15.611 --> 26:16.810
if she goes into labor.

26:16.812 --> 26:19.191
Bed rest isn't gonna
lower the current risks.

26:19.580 --> 26:21.851
I don't think the baby's gonna
survive without an intervention.

26:21.901 --> 26:23.598
It's the safest option we have.

26:23.648 --> 26:26.117
Unless... Trendelenburg position?

26:26.167 --> 26:27.436
You want to tilt her head-down?

26:27.486 --> 26:28.934
Yeah, we can use gravity to help us

26:28.984 --> 26:30.941
get the amniotic membrane before infection.

26:30.991 --> 26:32.010
Forget gravity.

26:32.060 --> 26:33.059
Foley catheter.

26:33.061 --> 26:34.441
To push the membrane back in.

26:34.491 --> 26:36.234
And then pete tape to suture.

26:36.350 --> 26:39.464
Get the ring forceps,
counterclockwise, 12, 9, 6, 3.

26:39.466 --> 26:41.033
And then we tie the knot.

26:41.129 --> 26:43.402
Ooh, I forgot
how much I love doing this.

26:48.352 --> 26:49.574
Julia's here.

26:49.576 --> 26:51.609
Where are the others?

26:52.745 --> 26:53.912
- Julia Kay?
- Hi.

26:53.914 --> 26:55.379
Hi, I'm Dr. Harris.

26:55.381 --> 26:57.682
I'm about to bring your mother
back into the operating room.

26:57.684 --> 26:58.850
Is she gonna be okay?

26:58.852 --> 27:00.785
We certainly hope so.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.821
But she made me promise to find out

27:02.823 --> 27:05.388
if you and your brothers
and sisters were okay.

27:05.390 --> 27:07.758
They're fine. My brother's
watching the younger ones.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.227
He can't take care of three
kids on his own, Julia.

27:10.229 --> 27:11.862
Dr. Harris, what was she doing?

27:11.864 --> 27:14.431
Um, I think she said that
she was building a treehouse

27:14.433 --> 27:15.599
for your sister.

27:15.601 --> 27:17.901
Geez, mom, give it a rest.

27:17.903 --> 27:19.036
Disrespectful.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.470
Am I gonna remember all this?

27:20.472 --> 27:22.438
Don't get me wrong.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.572
She's the best mom.

27:23.574 --> 27:25.674
It's just I told her like 100 times

27:25.676 --> 27:27.543
that I'd help her out with it.

27:27.545 --> 27:30.279
Yeah. Your mom seems, um...

27:31.381 --> 27:33.315
quite driven.

27:33.317 --> 27:35.446
You could also say that she
doesn't trust her kids enough

27:35.496 --> 27:37.086
to let them help her.

27:37.088 --> 27:38.221
I'm sorry.

27:38.223 --> 27:40.255
I don't know why I'm so mad.

27:40.257 --> 27:41.110
No, don't worry about it.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.424
Stress brings out emotions
you-you don't expect.

27:43.968 --> 27:46.427
Maybe you could check in at home for me?

27:51.734 --> 27:53.735
Hey, Peter. Um...

27:53.737 --> 27:55.370
No, no news.

27:55.372 --> 27:57.104
Did you guys eat?

27:59.241 --> 28:01.642
Your kids want to help you, Margot.

28:01.644 --> 28:03.911
- Okay, they brush their teeth?
- Are you gonna let them?

28:03.913 --> 28:05.946
- Because, um...
- What about homework?

28:05.948 --> 28:07.848
I kind of think you need them

28:07.850 --> 28:09.416
as much as they need you.

28:09.418 --> 28:11.618
Don't stay up too late, okay?

28:13.020 --> 28:15.454
Everything's good at home.

28:15.456 --> 28:17.290
Good.

28:17.292 --> 28:21.661
So, um... if something bad happens to mom...

28:21.663 --> 28:22.887
No, no, no.

28:22.998 --> 28:23.884
It's not gonna come to that.

28:23.934 --> 28:26.099
Not if I have anything to say about it.

28:26.101 --> 28:27.433
Why don't you grab a seat,

28:27.435 --> 28:29.169
and I'll come see you
when her surgery's done?

28:29.171 --> 28:32.905
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:36.476 --> 28:38.076
Feeling confident with a neck dissection?

28:38.078 --> 28:39.111
Yes.

28:39.113 --> 28:41.613
Metastasized nodes are in the dish.

28:41.615 --> 28:43.782
How's that flap coming along?

28:43.784 --> 28:46.051
Just finished dissecting distally.

28:46.053 --> 28:48.385
Time to clip some of these branches

28:48.387 --> 28:51.522
and give this chef his brand-new tongue.

28:51.762 --> 28:53.378
You sound like a kid in a candy store.

28:54.540 --> 28:56.505
Well, give me some
radial vessels to clear...

28:56.555 --> 28:58.586
mama's good as gold.

28:59.132 --> 29:00.998
Oh, it's been too long.

29:01.133 --> 29:03.067
Well, Paris has nothing over the O.R.

29:03.069 --> 29:05.150
I wouldn't quite say that.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.003
Paris had Joshua.

29:07.797 --> 29:08.907
Okay.

29:08.957 --> 29:10.440
Tumor is resected.

29:11.093 --> 29:12.740
Margins?

29:13.011 --> 29:14.302
1 centimeter all around.

29:14.352 --> 29:15.323
Suction, please.

29:15.450 --> 29:18.248
Okay, I'm just clearing some muscle.

29:18.739 --> 29:20.983
And I will close this site.

29:20.985 --> 29:24.954
It's amazing how you tapped
into his will to fight.

29:39.068 --> 29:41.192
You know, the bride shouldn't look that sad

29:41.242 --> 29:43.037
until after the honeymoon.

29:45.842 --> 29:48.434
Here, you need this more than I do.

29:50.445 --> 29:51.994
Dr. Williams
has everything under control.

29:52.044 --> 29:53.162
You'll be able to go up and see him

29:53.212 --> 29:54.582
in recovery soon enough.

29:55.517 --> 29:57.913
Do all your patients say
things they don't mean

29:58.153 --> 29:59.639
because of the pain?

29:59.958 --> 30:03.653
I find that pain is usually the
precipice for the truth, yeah.

30:03.926 --> 30:06.526
He's totally right.

30:07.463 --> 30:09.363
I kept hinting about his weight.

30:10.532 --> 30:13.909
What an awful thing to
do to a person you love.

30:15.423 --> 30:16.568
His weight bothered you?

30:16.570 --> 30:17.181
No.

30:17.231 --> 30:18.660
That's what's so stupid.

30:18.710 --> 30:20.461
I thought it bothered him.

30:21.239 --> 30:23.865
I wanted him to feel good about himself.

30:23.925 --> 30:25.587
Noble impulse.

30:26.540 --> 30:28.629
Poor execution, but...

30:29.016 --> 30:30.515
It's noble.

30:31.016 --> 30:32.617
Enjoy the coffee.

30:32.619 --> 30:34.685
I got to call our families

30:34.687 --> 30:37.989
and let them know
he's in surgery and the rest.

30:37.991 --> 30:40.892
You know, I-I think you should
probably talk to Cole first.

30:42.193 --> 30:43.962
I don't know what to say.

30:46.665 --> 30:48.799
I probably do.

30:55.624 --> 30:57.794
And I'd say
reconstruction is complete.

30:57.850 --> 30:59.009
It's a beauty of a tongue.

30:59.011 --> 31:00.945
Let's hope he sees it that way.

31:00.947 --> 31:03.825
Well, as soon as he gets through
his next irate dinner tirade,

31:03.875 --> 31:04.613
he will be.

31:04.615 --> 31:06.294
Great work, Dana.

31:06.344 --> 31:07.914
- Yeah, anything else?
- No.

31:07.964 --> 31:09.518
Come on, Reid. Spit it out.

31:09.520 --> 31:10.653
You've been sitting on it all day.

31:11.508 --> 31:13.232
Doctors, we have a problem.

31:13.458 --> 31:14.248
Yes, we do.

31:14.298 --> 31:15.737
The tongue is swelling, and fast.

31:15.787 --> 31:18.661
Arteries are pumping.
Venous anastamosis seems fine.

31:18.663 --> 31:20.626
Venous drainage isn't working in the flap.

31:20.676 --> 31:22.635
It's congested. What should we do?

31:22.685 --> 31:24.399
The only thing we can do.

31:24.401 --> 31:25.500
Get the leeches.

31:26.837 --> 31:28.203
We used a tension-free mesh,

31:28.205 --> 31:30.372
so your hernia recurrence
rate will be much lower.

31:30.374 --> 31:31.840
Just stay away from the weights

31:31.842 --> 31:33.442
or any twisting for a little while.

31:33.444 --> 31:35.844
Because you're thinking of
dumping me on our wedding day,

31:35.846 --> 31:37.544
and we have 400 people waiting for us

31:37.546 --> 31:39.480
at a gaudy banquet hall my dad picked out...

31:39.482 --> 31:40.481
That we're paying for.

31:41.350 --> 31:43.851
I'm sorry. I'm totally listening.

31:46.646 --> 31:48.356
I'm proposing to you.

31:51.060 --> 31:53.494
Someone told me that true love is being able

31:53.496 --> 31:56.129
to say the good things
behind your partner's back

31:56.131 --> 31:58.064
and the bad things to their face.

31:58.066 --> 31:59.765
And judging from today,

31:59.767 --> 32:02.469
I don't think we have a problem with that.

32:02.471 --> 32:05.271
I don't want you to be different.

32:05.273 --> 32:07.407
I want you to be happy.

32:07.409 --> 32:09.675
I want to make you happy.

32:09.677 --> 32:10.843
Well...

32:10.845 --> 32:13.512
I love cheeseburgers and
I hate running, okay?

32:13.514 --> 32:14.813
Okay.

32:14.815 --> 32:18.817
I-if someday that changes
and I start hitting the gym,

32:18.819 --> 32:20.152
that's my thing.

32:20.154 --> 32:21.387
I-I don't need reminders.

32:21.389 --> 32:23.588
Just like I don't need reminders about bills

32:23.590 --> 32:25.891
or the "did you really
need to buy that" look.

32:25.893 --> 32:27.859
Deal.

32:27.861 --> 32:30.395
The wedding will happen when it happens.

32:30.397 --> 32:31.595
Okay.

32:35.660 --> 32:37.204
It lives!

32:40.705 --> 32:42.907
Okay, first pin is set.

32:42.909 --> 32:46.243
Now drilling the second.

32:46.245 --> 32:48.412
Dr. Mirani. Good to see you.

32:48.414 --> 32:51.114
Power in numbers, right, Dr. Harris?

32:52.502 --> 32:54.951
You know, why don't you give this a whirl?

32:54.953 --> 32:56.553
I'll hold the sleeve.

32:56.555 --> 32:58.855
You want me to use the drill?

32:58.857 --> 33:00.190
Yep.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.733
Come here, little guy.

33:11.735 --> 33:14.370
Nice.

33:14.372 --> 33:15.837
Okay, little buddy.

33:15.839 --> 33:17.106
Let's get in there.

33:19.575 --> 33:21.809
How long do you leave them on for?

33:21.811 --> 33:24.312
Oh, I like my leeches nice and juicy.

33:24.314 --> 33:26.540
There goes any chance
of ever enjoying sushi.

33:26.590 --> 33:27.710
Oh, come on, Wayne.

33:27.760 --> 33:30.668
A little unagi really hit the spot.

33:30.963 --> 33:32.287
That's eel.

33:32.289 --> 33:35.123
This is just all kinds of gross.

33:35.125 --> 33:37.657
Swelling's subsiding.

33:38.620 --> 33:40.160
Told you.

33:46.435 --> 33:48.434
You don't need total
bed rest with this cerclage,

33:48.484 --> 33:49.903
but I do recommend some.

33:49.905 --> 33:51.571
I'll call
the blind federation tomorrow.

33:51.621 --> 33:54.229
If Ben needs space,
I should figure out some options.

33:54.279 --> 33:56.035
Don't do that.

33:57.334 --> 33:59.812
Ben,
I'm sorry for what I said.

33:59.814 --> 34:01.316
You've done so much.

34:01.468 --> 34:02.679
I'm sorry I left.

34:02.729 --> 34:04.262
I just...

34:05.086 --> 34:06.279
I'm here.

34:06.363 --> 34:07.778
Whatever you need.

34:08.688 --> 34:10.480
Would you still like to
know the baby's gender?

34:10.647 --> 34:11.971
Oh, absolutely.

34:12.858 --> 34:14.993
Miss peanut.

34:14.995 --> 34:16.228
Congratulations.

34:16.230 --> 34:18.741
The baby is safe. Mazel tov.

34:18.791 --> 34:20.431
My god.

34:20.434 --> 34:22.400
A girl.

34:24.370 --> 34:26.204
I'm having a baby girl.

34:32.043 --> 34:33.210
Hey.

34:33.212 --> 34:35.687
So, tonight, I can't do
another bad cup of coffee,

34:35.737 --> 34:38.831
so I was thinking instead,
we could go to this little bar.

34:38.882 --> 34:41.018
- It's just down the street.
- Okay, Kris.

34:44.554 --> 34:48.291
This thing we have, right,
it's pretty powerful.

34:48.293 --> 34:49.324
Yeah.

34:49.327 --> 34:51.194
Because of it, we have this connection.

34:51.663 --> 34:52.918
So I think that when you...

34:52.969 --> 34:55.130
what are you doing?

34:56.167 --> 34:57.933
Well, I just...

34:58.714 --> 35:00.970
Well, you said our connection...

35:01.202 --> 35:05.004
Our... our connection
because of what we have...

35:06.228 --> 35:08.577
because of what we can do.

35:11.537 --> 35:13.982
Kris, I told you, I'm in love with Alex.

35:14.184 --> 35:16.885
She'll never understand you the way I do.

35:18.182 --> 35:21.855
If I've misled you in any way,
I'm very sorry.

35:23.560 --> 35:25.826
I think it's best that we just...

35:25.994 --> 35:29.247
we go back to doing this
on our own from now on.

35:29.335 --> 35:30.298
Oh, and, what?

35:30.300 --> 35:33.834
Just pretend like we never met,
like none of this ever happened?

35:34.923 --> 35:36.832
Yeah.

35:40.196 --> 35:41.675
I'm very sorry.

35:48.402 --> 35:51.728
Syd, I know you're not
the type to stay in touch,

35:51.887 --> 35:53.924
but I h-hope I can e-mail.

35:54.107 --> 35:55.573
Of course.

35:56.061 --> 36:01.912
Just, you know, keep the baby
pics to a respectable amount.

36:06.105 --> 36:08.848
I just had this printed at the lab for you.

36:08.898 --> 36:10.298
What is it?

36:11.120 --> 36:12.662
This...

36:13.946 --> 36:15.947
is your baby girl.

36:20.371 --> 36:21.292
It's her.

36:21.342 --> 36:23.042
Oh, my god.

36:25.629 --> 36:27.745
My girl.

36:35.579 --> 36:37.861
So, just like that, you're dying?

36:37.957 --> 36:39.755
Pathology said the margins
are negative, right?

36:39.819 --> 36:42.183
Chef's prognosis looks good.

36:43.553 --> 36:45.951
Oh, how beautiful.
Let me get a vase and some water.

36:46.001 --> 36:46.501
Oh.

36:46.551 --> 36:49.724
So you bother to keep
some stupid flowers alive?

36:50.692 --> 36:51.709
Alex, I don't want to have this disc...

36:51.759 --> 36:53.423
You know, Dana, when you're
fighting for somebody else's life,

36:53.473 --> 36:54.830
I have seen you do amazing things,

36:54.880 --> 36:56.755
which is why I can't stand
by and watch you do this.

36:56.805 --> 36:58.449
I will not be a passive friend.

36:58.565 --> 37:00.976
Certainly nothing passive
about paging Storms today.

37:01.026 --> 37:01.981
Got your attention, didn't it?

37:02.031 --> 37:03.268
You paged him

37:03.455 --> 37:05.608
because you thought
since I'm not fighting for my life

37:05.658 --> 37:07.700
in the way you think I should

37:07.750 --> 37:09.813
that I'm not gonna fight for my patients?

37:09.905 --> 37:11.061
I don't know what to think.

37:11.120 --> 37:12.324
I don't know who you are.

37:12.374 --> 37:15.637
Who stops their chemo and runs
off with some guy they just met?

37:15.687 --> 37:17.060
What about Molly?

37:17.110 --> 37:17.968
Who am I?

37:18.018 --> 37:18.735
I'm not the person

37:18.785 --> 37:20.735
who's gonna spend
my final moments being poisoned,

37:20.785 --> 37:24.649
watching my kid sit around,
waiting for some miracle!

37:26.325 --> 37:27.678
That's not who I am.

37:27.728 --> 37:28.754
Time to accept that.

37:28.804 --> 37:30.681
No, I do not accept that.

37:30.731 --> 37:32.298
I will not accept that.

37:32.348 --> 37:35.033
This is beatable.

37:37.396 --> 37:40.472
Hey.

37:40.892 --> 37:43.797
Let's pick a night, drink some barolo,

37:43.847 --> 37:45.691
just be us for a while.

37:45.802 --> 37:47.401
Isn't that a good plan?

37:51.590 --> 37:52.754
No.

37:54.261 --> 37:57.824
A good plan is finding more
time for you to be with us,

37:57.874 --> 38:00.790
with Molly, and for your work.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.803
Which is truly art.

38:02.853 --> 38:05.328
Dana, I don't see this in your face.

38:05.330 --> 38:08.698
All due respect, sweetheart,
who do you think you are?

38:10.234 --> 38:12.402
Someone who loves you.

38:18.280 --> 38:20.237
So, Margot's gonna be okay.

38:20.289 --> 38:21.720
The question is, are you?

38:22.202 --> 38:24.670
Ah, failure is something I've
never been able to accept,

38:24.720 --> 38:27.296
but I do seem to attract it a lot lately.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.182
That's because you're chasing perfection.

38:29.232 --> 38:30.401
Don't.

38:30.696 --> 38:32.948
The secret isn't trying to be perfect.

38:33.064 --> 38:36.285
The secret is just trying
to get better every day.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.760
Well, thank you for
everything today, Dr. Harris.

38:38.810 --> 38:40.119
You're welcome.

38:40.339 --> 38:43.308
Do you think, uh,
ortho might be your thing someday?

38:43.471 --> 38:46.186
Oh, well,
I'm keeping an open mind.

38:46.236 --> 38:48.703
I do dig the power tools, though.

38:59.080 --> 39:02.927
And you're still here, and that's not good.

39:02.977 --> 39:04.298
Actually, it is.

39:04.386 --> 39:06.985
You know how long it's been
since I had any time to myself?

39:07.319 --> 39:08.691
Were you building that treehouse

39:08.762 --> 39:11.010
so you'd have somewhere to hide for a nap?

39:11.601 --> 39:14.526
The kids are looking
after themselves, right?

39:14.953 --> 39:17.484
I only want one more hour.

39:19.993 --> 39:21.837
You know,
you didn't have to walk me out.

39:21.870 --> 39:24.536
and have you guilt-trip me
for the rest of my life?

39:24.538 --> 39:25.905
No, thanks.

39:26.205 --> 39:28.040
You're a great doctor, Maggie.

39:28.042 --> 39:29.708
I had a great teacher.

39:29.710 --> 39:31.743
Have. I'm not dead.

39:33.214 --> 39:36.240
Tel Aviv. It's a long way.

39:36.290 --> 39:37.085
It is.

39:39.299 --> 39:41.319
Your girlfriend's a lucky woman.

39:42.448 --> 39:43.721
Thank you.

39:46.425 --> 39:49.627
Goodbyes really aren't my thing, so...

39:49.878 --> 39:52.196
Tell me something I don't know.

39:55.327 --> 39:57.935
You're the only almost I ever think about.

39:59.637 --> 40:02.139
And I do think about you, Maggie.

40:10.614 --> 40:13.817
I owed you one.

40:25.796 --> 40:27.196
No, I want red tomatoes.

40:44.881 --> 40:46.281
I totally did not remember

40:46.283 --> 40:48.282
that today was
our six-month anniversary.

40:48.284 --> 40:51.118
And I totally noticed that
in a very embarrassing way.

40:53.026 --> 40:54.424
I'm sorry, I just...

40:54.474 --> 40:57.124
I'm not the kind of person who
remembers things like that.

40:58.394 --> 40:59.893
I'll remember when
your favorite band is in town,

40:59.895 --> 41:03.230
and I'll always bring you
soup when you're sick.

41:03.232 --> 41:06.499
But anniversaries, I'll forget.

41:06.652 --> 41:09.165
What can I say, Cass?

41:09.215 --> 41:10.727
I like a reason to celebrate,

41:10.777 --> 41:13.672
and I think we're worth celebrating.

41:15.676 --> 41:18.611
What if tonight,
we start a new anniversary?

41:19.914 --> 41:24.082
Minus the swivel chair.

41:28.022 --> 41:31.089
All right, mommy's gonna try
out this new recipe on you.

41:31.091 --> 41:33.258
Broccoli with a little bit of peaches.

41:33.260 --> 41:35.280
It's gonna be good! You want to try?

41:35.330 --> 41:36.856
No? I-I get it.

41:36.906 --> 41:38.605
Okay, let me... let me try.

41:40.699 --> 41:42.033
Mmm!

41:42.035 --> 41:44.535
Really good.

41:44.537 --> 41:46.870
We might make a big mess again.

41:46.872 --> 41:48.539
Mmm, that daddy's gonna be cleaning up.

41:48.541 --> 41:49.706
- Yes, he is.
- Yes, he will.

41:50.709 --> 41:51.875
Yes, he will.

41:54.902 --> 41:56.913
Okay, let's try this again, all right?

41:56.915 --> 41:58.114
It's like a train.

42:04.056 --> 42:06.022
Mmm. Really good.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.490
You like that?

42:07.492 --> 42:10.826
Aww, should I not try to make food?

42:12.264 --> 42:13.462
Put it back in.

42:13.464 --> 42:15.531
You won't put it back in?

42:15.533 --> 42:17.232
Why not?

42:17.234 --> 42:18.400
What was that?

42:18.402 --> 42:20.335
Uh, absolutely nothing.

42:20.337 --> 42:21.937
Yay. Here, daddy.

42:21.939 --> 42:23.939
Mmm, can I try some now?

42:23.941 --> 42:25.840
Oh, that looks so good.

42:25.842 --> 42:27.742
Daddy wants to try some.

42:27.744 --> 42:29.844
Mmm!

42:29.846 --> 42:31.912
Swallow.

42:31.914 --> 42:33.047
It's actually pretty good.

42:33.049 --> 42:35.015
I would buy it. Swallow.

42:35.017 --> 42:36.750
Okay.
