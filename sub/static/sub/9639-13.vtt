00:05.520 --> 00:07.610
- How's your last day of school, Alex?
- Oh, tough.

00:07.750 --> 00:10.380
So many people were signing
my yearbook, l ran out of room.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.050
l had to get a second yearbook.

00:12.190 --> 00:14.160
How'd you get a second yearbook?
They're all gone.

00:15.730 --> 00:17.920
Where's my yearbook, Alex?

00:18.060 --> 00:20.260
Come on, Justin.
Hardly anybody signed it.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.030
And one of them was you.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.600
Maybe l was saving room for friends.

00:24.740 --> 00:25.860
Like who?

00:26.470 --> 00:28.410
Vice Principal Clements,
Earl the crossing guard,

00:28.540 --> 00:30.870
my biology teacher
and all the ladies in the front office.

00:31.010 --> 00:33.200
So basically all your friends are adults.

00:33.340 --> 00:36.250
Yeah, well, l fit in best with adults.
l'm very mature.

00:36.380 --> 00:38.750
will Justin Russo report
to Lost and Found?

00:38.880 --> 00:40.850
we have your cape and lightsaber,

00:44.690 --> 00:47.180
l can't believe they found
where l hid those.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:41.810 --> 01:45.540
You know how regular wizard mail
can sometimes take up to an hour?

01:45.680 --> 01:48.450
Well, we now have WlPS.

01:48.590 --> 01:50.780
Wizard lnstant Parcel Service.

01:50.920 --> 01:53.050
You can send mail instantly.

01:53.730 --> 01:55.750
You mean like e-mail?

01:55.890 --> 01:57.290
No, no, no. Let me show you.

01:57.430 --> 02:00.190
You do it with this.

02:00.330 --> 02:01.800
An old key, wow.

02:03.430 --> 02:05.600
Okay, make fun, you clowns,
but watch this.

02:05.740 --> 02:08.830
Here, Alex, take this key
and go over there.

02:08.970 --> 02:12.270
Now, open a portal mail slot in midair.

02:12.410 --> 02:14.170
Really? Okay.

02:17.620 --> 02:21.240
lf you say ''mailus-spontaneous''
followed by a name or a place,

02:21.390 --> 02:22.480
the envelope will go there.

02:22.620 --> 02:23.810
Here, send this to Justin.

02:25.460 --> 02:27.980
Mailus-spontaneous Justin Russo.

02:32.630 --> 02:34.530
lt worked. Hey, that was fast.

02:37.970 --> 02:39.630
lt's a messenger pigeon
from Wiz Tech.

02:39.770 --> 02:43.800
You know, in my day, these were real.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.410
They've accepted me
for summer boarding school.

02:47.550 --> 02:50.570
Well, of course they accepted you.
Who else would wanna go?

02:50.720 --> 02:51.770
Lots of people.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.850
lf you get into Wiz Tech,
you're a shoo-in for Transylvania State.

02:54.990 --> 02:56.480
You mean it gets better?

02:57.020 --> 02:58.750
And you know the best part
about Wiz Tech?

02:58.890 --> 03:01.950
l get a whole summer away
from you-know-who.

03:02.090 --> 03:04.460
l know you mean me.
And that's totally unfair.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.600
Awesome.
Hey, let's scare Justin again.

03:22.180 --> 03:25.380
Okay, l think you have everything
you need for Wiz Tech.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.380
Oh, and l packed
your new school uniform.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.210
A brand-new wizard robe.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.410
Oh, no, Mom.
They switched to black bathrobes.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.580
The old robes are too formal
for these modern casual times.

03:36.630 --> 03:38.860
Okay, then we'll just run out
and get you a bathrobe.

03:39.260 --> 03:41.960
And we should get him
some turkey jerky for the long trip.

03:42.100 --> 03:45.000
Jerry, Justin doesn't like turkey jerky.
You do.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.170
Would it hurt us
to get a little turkey jerky?

03:48.870 --> 03:51.870
Hey, Alex, you missed
a little spot right there.

03:52.010 --> 03:53.200
What do you mean?

03:53.340 --> 03:56.540
lt's the only spot in this house
that doesn't have your junk all over it.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.210
We're taking your brother shopping,
and by the time we get back,

03:59.350 --> 04:02.410
l expect you to have all your stuff
back up in your room.

04:03.050 --> 04:05.680
Okay. Come on, Max,
you got a lot of cleaning up to do.

04:05.820 --> 04:06.880
No, no, no.

04:07.630 --> 04:09.750
Your mess, your responsibility.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.630
Man, getting all this stuff back in my room
is gonna take forever.

04:19.070 --> 04:20.940
Or not.

04:24.680 --> 04:25.730
This will be easy.

04:25.880 --> 04:27.640
l'll just send all my stuff
back to my room.

04:27.780 --> 04:31.150
Mailus-spontaneous
Alex Russo's bedroom.

04:34.050 --> 04:36.110
Hey, that thing's
kind of like a big vacuum.

04:36.250 --> 04:39.750
Yeah.
Let me see if l can move it around.

04:43.390 --> 04:45.090
Awesome.
l'll be done in like five minutes.

04:45.230 --> 04:46.990
Mom and Dad will never--

04:51.640 --> 04:54.660
That's a little cleaner
than l was going for.

04:55.270 --> 04:58.440
l'd run away right now,
but l don't know where to go.

04:59.210 --> 05:00.840
Dad's gonna have a cow.

05:00.980 --> 05:04.510
And a sheep and a pig and a goat
when he sees all this.

05:05.650 --> 05:07.410
Hide.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.650
Oh, never mind.

05:12.060 --> 05:15.150
Boy, l really love this turkey jerky.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.860
lt sure makes me thirsty, though.

05:22.070 --> 05:24.900
Theresa, why can't l open the fridge?

05:25.040 --> 05:26.940
Because it's not there.

05:31.180 --> 05:33.080
- What did you do?
- l...

05:34.080 --> 05:36.270
Daddy, let me just cut to it.

05:36.410 --> 05:38.210
This portal--

05:45.020 --> 05:47.750
Okay, this is the last of it.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.220
What are we gonna do with you?

05:49.590 --> 05:52.720
You have to learn to stop using magic
as a shortcut to everything.

05:52.860 --> 05:54.260
You are so undisciplined.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.130
That's why l can't wait
to get to Wiz Tech,

05:56.270 --> 05:58.900
where everyone is so much more
serious about magic.

05:59.040 --> 06:02.100
All summer long, l'll be in classes
that focus on the craft of magic

06:02.240 --> 06:04.610
and using it respectfully,
the way it's meant to be.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.640
Right, Dad?

06:09.710 --> 06:12.710
Why are you guys looking at me
like l just gave you an idea?

06:12.850 --> 06:14.940
Please don't tell me
he just gave you an idea.

06:16.790 --> 06:19.420
Can someone tell me what the idea is?

06:37.910 --> 06:40.500
This is a terrible idea,
bringing Alex here to Wiz Tech.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.410
l know you had your heart set
on getting away from your sister,

06:43.550 --> 06:45.140
but this could really be good for her.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.080
And good for all of us.

06:48.290 --> 06:50.620
Don't worry, Justin.
Look at this, this is a big place.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.820
l'm sure you and Alex
will hardly see each other.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.050
Justin and Alex Russo?

06:56.190 --> 06:59.220
l'm Dr. Evilini.
You will both be in my class.

07:02.170 --> 07:04.360
Here are your spectacles.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.300
Oh, sweet.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.830
You know, with those glasses and that
robe on, you remind me of someone.

07:10.980 --> 07:14.410
ls it Terry something?
Barry something?

07:14.550 --> 07:17.510
Larry something? Oh, never mind.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.280
What kind of powers
do these glasses give you?

07:20.420 --> 07:21.480
None.

07:21.620 --> 07:24.350
They just look wonderful
with the black bathrobes.

07:24.490 --> 07:25.920
Great. We're accessorizing ugly.

07:26.060 --> 07:27.990
Mom, Dad, please don't make me stay.

07:28.130 --> 07:29.860
Yeah, please don't make her stay.

07:29.990 --> 07:31.830
Come on, guys. The time will fly.

07:31.960 --> 07:34.020
Oh, and, Justin, here is the portal key.

07:34.170 --> 07:36.570
lf you get homesick,
just send us a note.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.830
What about me? Can l use the portal key
to send you a note?

07:39.970 --> 07:41.910
We've seen enough of you
and the portal key.

07:48.610 --> 07:50.840
Don't worry, honey.
Our kids will be fine.

07:50.980 --> 07:54.010
l'm not worried about our kids.
l'm worried about the other kids.

07:54.150 --> 07:56.210
Alex is there.

07:57.050 --> 07:58.320
Max, what's all this?

07:58.460 --> 08:00.150
Well, now that l'm an only child,

08:00.290 --> 08:02.780
we can do all that stuff
that we've been too busy to do.

08:03.230 --> 08:04.850
Dad, what do you wanna start with?

08:05.630 --> 08:06.760
Nap.

08:06.900 --> 08:08.990
- Bike riding around Central Park?
- A nap.

08:09.370 --> 08:12.000
- Well, how about--?
- A nap.

08:12.140 --> 08:13.400
- Jerry.
- What?

08:13.540 --> 08:16.200
Okay. Okay.

08:16.340 --> 08:20.830
Max, let's start with
what you wanna do most.

08:20.980 --> 08:23.140
- Camping.
- Camping?

08:23.610 --> 08:24.740
That's a good one.

08:25.180 --> 08:26.810
Give me that.

08:28.090 --> 08:31.180
Oh, come on. You're city guys.

08:31.320 --> 08:32.409
Your idea of roughing it

08:32.559 --> 08:36.049
is when they deliver Chinese food
without the fortune cookies.

08:37.030 --> 08:39.220
Dad, do you smell that?

08:39.530 --> 08:42.090
lt smells like a challenge.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.960
With a hint
of questioning our manhood.

08:45.870 --> 08:47.600
You know, we could rough it
if we wanted to.

08:47.740 --> 08:48.800
lt's just, we don't.

08:48.940 --> 08:53.170
Because there's no wilderness
around here.

08:53.310 --> 08:55.580
Oh, well, we can camp on the terrace.

08:55.710 --> 08:56.810
Terrace?

08:56.950 --> 09:00.780
One night out there might as well be
an episode of Survivor for you two.

09:00.920 --> 09:01.980
Oh, yeah?

09:02.120 --> 09:03.450
- We could spend one--
- Two.

09:03.590 --> 09:06.790
- Three nights on the terrace.
- Or even a whole week.

09:06.920 --> 09:10.290
l think three nights will do it, buddy.

09:10.430 --> 09:13.160
Okay, campers.
Three nights on the terrace.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.290
You come inside, you lose.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.030
- You are on.
- Yeah.

09:17.170 --> 09:18.230
Fine, boys.

09:18.370 --> 09:21.930
Enjoy everything Mother Nature
has to offer.

09:26.910 --> 09:28.310
You there, on the terrace.

09:28.450 --> 09:32.780
Have you seen a stocky male, late 30s,
running with a sack full of money?

09:33.320 --> 09:34.380
No.

09:34.520 --> 09:37.150
- Are you locked out?
- No.

09:37.290 --> 09:40.280
Has your manhood
been called into question?

09:40.420 --> 09:42.120
- Yes.
- Yes.

09:42.830 --> 09:45.630
Hang in there, guys.

09:51.870 --> 09:52.930
Anybody?

09:54.240 --> 09:55.500
Anybody?

09:58.210 --> 09:59.270
Thank you, Dr. Evilini.

09:59.410 --> 10:01.640
That would be
the Lithuanian Lethal Lamp,

10:01.780 --> 10:04.210
known for their anaconda-like
electrical cords.

10:04.350 --> 10:05.410
Excellent.

10:05.550 --> 10:08.680
So, everyone, beware.

10:09.390 --> 10:11.050
That sounded scary.

10:12.520 --> 10:13.820
Topnotch, Russo.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.430
You really have a grasp
on venomous furniture.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.260
Don't you agree, class?

10:18.400 --> 10:19.920
- Nice one, Russo.
- Nice job.

10:20.060 --> 10:22.260
What? Only one bar
in the wizard world?

10:22.400 --> 10:24.030
This stinks.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.130
- l'll take that.
- Okay.

10:28.270 --> 10:30.500
Feel free to add your number
so we don't lose touch.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.670
Yeah, okay.

10:37.850 --> 10:39.910
What's with you and the tiny stuff?

10:40.050 --> 10:44.390
Oh, l come from a family of giants,
but l'm kind of the runt of the litter.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.690
So Mom and Dad surround me
with miniature things

10:47.830 --> 10:50.290
so my self-esteem doesn't get bruised.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.450
And you're okay with that?

10:52.600 --> 10:56.160
Sure, except this tiny underwear
rides up a lot.

11:01.740 --> 11:04.230
l'm Hugh. Hugh Normous.

11:04.980 --> 11:07.000
Not really.

11:08.010 --> 11:10.450
Well, that new guy, Justin,
is pretty cool, huh?

11:10.580 --> 11:12.110
Yeah, the coolest.

11:12.250 --> 11:13.550
- Watch this.
- Okay.

11:13.680 --> 11:17.120
Not only is it known
for its highly venomous vapors,

11:17.250 --> 11:20.620
it also engulfs its victims.

11:22.790 --> 11:25.320
That would be
the Brustromian Beanbag Chair.

11:25.460 --> 11:27.760
lmpressive, Russo.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.010
''Love, Alex.''

11:44.150 --> 11:45.740
Yeah.

11:46.550 --> 11:50.780
Miss Russo,
l get the feeling you're too undisciplined

11:50.920 --> 11:53.820
to appreciate
what Wiz Tech has to offer.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.720
And l get the feeling that you people
here at Wiz Tech don't get me.

12:01.370 --> 12:03.860
Perhaps this will get your attention.

12:11.210 --> 12:14.040
Those J's are like fishhooks.

12:14.910 --> 12:18.310
Summer has just begun, Russo.

12:25.990 --> 12:28.360
Hey, Justin.
How'd you like my exploding note?

12:28.490 --> 12:30.860
l thought it was a blast.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.520
Well, no one else did.

12:33.660 --> 12:36.220
Messing with me didn't turn out
like you thought, did it?

12:36.370 --> 12:39.930
Everyone around here thinks l'm cool
and they think you're a loser.

12:40.070 --> 12:41.540
A loser? What are you talking about?

12:41.670 --> 12:44.870
People love hanging out with me.
Hey, who wants to have lunch with me?

12:45.010 --> 12:47.480
- Loser.
- Loser, no.

12:48.910 --> 12:50.640
l'll have lunch with you.

12:50.780 --> 12:55.810
l hope you like baby corn,
baby carrots and tiny mugs of juice.

12:56.390 --> 12:58.510
Yeah, have fun with the really tiny giant.

13:00.760 --> 13:03.390
Oh, yeah? Well, let's see how big man
on campus fits in with this.

13:03.530 --> 13:06.000
From your chin to your toes,
an elephant trunk grows.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.230
Russo!

13:15.010 --> 13:18.240
That really wasn't meant for you. Sorry.

13:22.750 --> 13:25.010
But clearly this is meant for me.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.820
- Got any fours?
- Go fish.

13:42.170 --> 13:43.220
You got any twos?

13:44.640 --> 13:46.260
Go fish.

13:54.510 --> 13:57.140
l ain't fishing in that pond.

14:06.660 --> 14:11.120
l've summoned Justin Russo
as you requested, Dr. Evilini.

14:22.870 --> 14:24.100
You wanted to see me?

14:24.240 --> 14:26.270
Yes. Pick up that Bidaddle.

14:27.780 --> 14:29.210
Why?

14:30.310 --> 14:31.750
What? Wha--?

14:32.250 --> 14:33.680
Just as l thought.

14:34.490 --> 14:37.580
lt has been written that great
12-ball players turn into great wizards.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.660
And you just might be one.

14:41.890 --> 14:43.860
What were we talking about?

14:44.860 --> 14:45.920
Twelve ball.

14:46.060 --> 14:47.690
What's 12 ball? lt looks like Ping-Pong.

14:47.830 --> 14:49.030
lt's nothing like Ping-Pong.

14:50.030 --> 14:51.900
These balls are added one by one

14:52.040 --> 14:55.230
with the objective
of 12 being played simultaneously.

14:55.370 --> 14:59.370
Only one student has ever reached
1 1 balls here at Wiz Tech.

14:59.510 --> 15:01.940
- Who's that?
- Jerko Phoenix.

15:02.080 --> 15:05.340
You'll meet him in due time, my boy.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.570
Due time.

15:08.950 --> 15:11.080
That sounded mysterious.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.080
What do you say? Are you up to it?

15:14.220 --> 15:17.660
l am. l am up to the challenge.

15:22.170 --> 15:24.070
Gonna get some water.

16:03.870 --> 16:05.100
What's the big deal?

16:05.240 --> 16:06.870
He's the best l've ever seen.

16:07.410 --> 16:09.680
You're the worst best friend ever.

16:10.780 --> 16:12.980
Wait up, Alex.

16:14.390 --> 16:18.720
Mr. Russo, it's time for you
to take on the very best 12-ball player

16:18.860 --> 16:21.450
here at Wiz Tech
in a non-binding scrimmage.

16:31.570 --> 16:33.060
Justin Russo, meet--

16:33.200 --> 16:35.190
Jerko Phoenix.

16:35.340 --> 16:36.400
Jerko?

16:36.540 --> 16:38.170
That must be a tough name
to grow up with.

16:38.310 --> 16:39.940
l had a cousin whose name was Kim.

16:40.080 --> 16:43.070
Well, Kim was a guy,
so l'm sure you can imagine people--

16:43.210 --> 16:44.440
Enough.

16:46.120 --> 16:51.110
Better warn you that l plan on winning
the title of Mr. 12 Ball.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.320
What's up with your eye?

16:55.330 --> 16:56.550
Twelve ball accident?

16:58.500 --> 17:00.360
There's nothing wrong with my eye.

17:01.900 --> 17:05.560
This gets me out of wearing
those stupid glasses.

17:27.829 --> 17:30.450
lt's been raining all night
and they're eating weeds again.

17:30.590 --> 17:32.790
That's it. Game over.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.570
Help! Max!

17:42.710 --> 17:45.300
- Jerry, help!
- Mom, are you all right?

17:45.440 --> 17:47.540
- What happened?
- l saw a rat.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.700
lt's under the couch. l saw a rat.

17:49.850 --> 17:51.470
A rat?

17:54.950 --> 17:58.180
You guys. Help, now.

17:59.420 --> 18:01.020
But...

18:05.900 --> 18:08.420
lt's under the...? Okay.

18:14.640 --> 18:15.830
Well, the tail looks like a--

18:15.970 --> 18:18.070
A rat, Jerry. lt's a rat.

18:22.210 --> 18:24.200
That's it. You guys can't stay
out there anymore.

18:24.350 --> 18:25.610
You guys win.

18:26.050 --> 18:27.450
l need you in here.

18:27.580 --> 18:30.580
Thanks. Max, camping trip is over.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.690
We gotta be in here
to protect our little lady.

18:33.620 --> 18:35.150
You know how weak women can be.

18:35.630 --> 18:37.360
- Don't push it.
- Sorry.

18:41.970 --> 18:44.660
l gotta put this little guy back
in his natural habitat.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.670
The subway.

18:48.540 --> 18:51.100
Hey, Mom, that was really a potato,
wasn't it?

18:51.240 --> 18:52.670
Yeah.

18:52.810 --> 18:55.680
Do you have any more?
Because l'm starving.

18:55.810 --> 18:58.750
Sure, baby. How do you want your rat?
Mashed or fried?

19:26.810 --> 19:28.110
This door is locked too?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.510
Yes, l am.

19:33.180 --> 19:34.880
Alex.

19:35.020 --> 19:37.250
What are you doing? lt's bath night.

19:39.190 --> 19:42.450
Oh, just chitchatting with the door.

19:42.590 --> 19:44.750
Hey, Justin,
you know the portal key Dad gave you?

19:44.900 --> 19:46.730
l need it.
l wanna send something home.

19:46.860 --> 19:48.460
Oh, okay.

19:48.970 --> 19:51.630
Wait. Why do you have your suitcase?

19:52.700 --> 19:55.040
l just want Mom
to do some laundry for me.

19:55.170 --> 19:57.610
Hey, you're trying
to send yourself home.

19:57.740 --> 20:00.870
Okay. So, what do you care?
You love all the work at this place.

20:01.010 --> 20:02.380
l can't stand it. l'm out of here.

20:02.950 --> 20:06.640
- Alex, you can't leave.
- Oh, yeah? Watch me.

20:08.390 --> 20:11.050
Mailus-spontaneous Russo home.

20:12.190 --> 20:13.320
Alex.

20:16.660 --> 20:17.890
Here, Hugh.

20:18.030 --> 20:19.890
l do appreciate the help with the mail.

20:20.030 --> 20:22.830
Oh, you're welcome.
But it's a little lonely.

20:22.970 --> 20:25.960
l wish my new friend Alex
would drop by once in a while.

20:29.010 --> 20:32.460
Hey, everybody. l'm hosed.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.070
- Alex.
- Alex.

20:35.210 --> 20:36.870
All mail goes through Dr. Evilini.

20:37.010 --> 20:38.850
l guess you know that now.

20:40.580 --> 20:42.280
Alex Russo.

20:42.420 --> 20:46.750
Trying to run away instead of facing up
to the challenges of Wiz Tech?

20:46.890 --> 20:51.850
l can see l'm going to have to pull out
the old discipline bucket.

20:53.230 --> 20:54.820
The who?

21:02.510 --> 21:03.730
Oh, she wasn't kidding.

21:03.870 --> 21:06.740
There really is a discipline bucket.

21:07.480 --> 21:08.810
l hate this place.

21:08.950 --> 21:11.040
Keep scrubbing.

21:14.050 --> 21:15.680
Are you sure you've got the message?

21:15.820 --> 21:17.680
Yes.

21:17.820 --> 21:20.260
Good.
Then take it straight to my mother.

21:20.390 --> 21:22.620
She'll finally be proud of me.

21:23.130 --> 21:24.650
Now go, messenger fish.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.920
Flop like the wind.

21:31.470 --> 21:33.330
Hey, l just scrubbed there.

21:33.700 --> 21:38.070
Dear Mama, after the 12-ball tournament
reveals the best young wizard,

21:38.210 --> 21:41.370
l will drain that wizard's powers
and take them for myself,

21:41.510 --> 21:44.500
making me
the most powerful wizard ever.

21:44.650 --> 21:47.050
Love, Mary Beth Evilini.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.720
Justin's gonna get his powers drained.

21:54.660 --> 21:57.290
This place is a freak show.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.450
Okay, let's review,

22:00.600 --> 22:02.160
They've accepted me
for summer school.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.200
Please don't tell me
he just gave you an idea.

22:04.330 --> 22:07.500
- Mom, Dad, please don't make me stay.
- Yeah, please don't make her stay.

22:07.640 --> 22:11.700
Trying to run away instead of facing up
to the challenges of Wiz Tech?

22:13.580 --> 22:16.880
lt has been written that great
12-ball players turn into great wizards.

22:17.950 --> 22:19.640
He's the best l've ever seen.

22:19.780 --> 22:21.840
Justin's gonna get his powers drained.

22:21.990 --> 22:25.250
So, everyone, beware.
