06:05.032 --> 06:05.997
There's five more there.

06:05.999 --> 06:06.631

06:13.741 --> 06:15.006
then absolve him of his sins.

06:21.749 --> 06:22.581
let him inside me?

06:22.583 --> 06:23.648
>> Why would I want you to...?

06:23.650 --> 06:24.316
No!

06:24.318 --> 06:25.317

06:25.319 --> 06:26.084

06:26.086 --> 06:27.686

06:28.655 --> 06:29.488
if he wants up inside me, it

06:29.490 --> 06:30.389
will cost you a whole sixer, I

06:36.897 --> 06:37.896

06:37.898 --> 06:39.965
you have to earn it.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.337

06:48.975 --> 06:49.774
No, I can't imagine they let him

06:49.777 --> 06:50.909

06:50.911 --> 06:51.676
right?

06:51.678 --> 06:52.577
>> I don't like loony bins.

06:52.579 --> 06:53.378
This is giving me a

06:53.380 --> 06:54.079

06:54.681 --> 06:55.447

06:55.449 --> 06:56.515
Frank, but these places, they're

06:56.517 --> 06:57.215
a necessary evil.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.083
I'm telling you, you got to

06:58.085 --> 06:59.117
trust the system; let's just get

06:59.119 --> 07:00.051
Pete back into the system.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.086

system in place for everything,

07:02.089 --> 07:02.721
okay?

07:02.723 --> 07:03.555
We don't have to panic.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.423
Everything's gonna be fine.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.428

07:12.633 --> 07:13.899

07:13.901 --> 07:15.233
Looks like this place has been

07:15.235 --> 07:18.303
shut down for months.

07:18.305 --> 07:19.738
>> Oh, my God, Dennis, listen to

07:19.740 --> 07:22.040
this: "Reed Mental Institution

07:22.042 --> 07:22.874
was shut down because of

07:22.876 --> 07:24.075
statewide cutbacks."

07:24.077 --> 07:24.976
Oh, so they just cut all the

07:24.978 --> 07:26.111

07:28.215 --> 07:29.247
That's-that's insane!

07:29.249 --> 07:30.215

07:31.118 --> 07:31.950
>> What?!

07:31.952 --> 07:32.551

07:33.353 --> 07:34.152

07:34.154 --> 07:35.053
I already pay a ton in taxes.

07:35.055 --> 07:35.987

07:36.924 --> 07:37.756
these places.

10:45.078 --> 10:45.944
get what we're going for.

10:45.946 --> 10:46.845
Cricket, we're gonna confess.

10:46.847 --> 10:47.679
>> Okay, fine.

10:47.681 --> 10:50.181
All right, um... he used to, um,

10:50.183 --> 10:51.816
scream in baby's faces.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.152
(Cricket laughs)

10:54.154 --> 10:55.654
(laughing)

10:55.656 --> 10:56.521
>> Well, that's just funny.

10:56.523 --> 10:57.355
That was just plain funny.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.256
>> I know, I know, I know.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.257
>> They'd be all freaked out...

10:59.259 --> 11:00.125
>> Okay, no, you know what he

11:00.127 --> 11:00.859
used to do?

11:00.861 --> 11:01.693
He used to gather, like, cats

11:01.695 --> 11:02.293
and dogs...

11:02.295 --> 11:03.044
>> Oh, yeah.

11:03.045 --> 11:03.794
>> ...and then put them into

11:03.797 --> 11:04.663
like a little room and, like,

11:04.665 --> 11:06.097
have 'em battle it out.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.198
>> That's just cats' and dogs'

11:07.200 --> 11:08.266
nature, to fight, so I don't see

11:08.268 --> 11:09.100
a problem with that.

11:09.101 --> 11:09.933
>> Oh, also, he murdered and ate

11:09.936 --> 11:10.935
his family.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.137
>> Right.

11:12.139 --> 11:12.971
>> What?

11:12.973 --> 11:14.506
>> See, there was like a

11:14.508 --> 11:16.107
Christmas dinner thing with,

11:16.109 --> 11:17.008
like, the eating of his family

11:17.010 --> 11:18.977
and a burning of the house down.

11:18.979 --> 11:19.778
>> Is this Psycho Pete?

11:19.780 --> 11:20.645
>> Yeah, yeah.

11:20.647 --> 11:21.513
>> Yeah.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.447
>> Jesus Christ!

11:22.449 --> 11:23.682
That guy's a goddamn maniac!

11:23.684 --> 11:24.616
I'm not absolving him!

11:24.618 --> 11:25.684
He should be in jail!

11:25.686 --> 11:28.053
>> Hey, guys?

11:28.055 --> 11:29.621
>> Pete, is that you?

11:29.623 --> 11:30.622
Hey, man.

11:30.624 --> 11:31.556
>> I'm gonna get out of here,

11:31.558 --> 11:32.157
okay?

11:32.159 --> 11:33.124
>> Oh...

11:33.126 --> 11:34.459
>> I'm gonna use... use the

11:34.461 --> 11:35.660
women's restroom.

11:35.662 --> 11:36.695
>> Oh, sure!

11:36.697 --> 11:37.696
Yeah, a lot of people in here.

11:37.698 --> 11:38.329
>> Yeah.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.164
>> Kind of a full house.

11:39.166 --> 11:39.948
>> You can...

11:39.949 --> 11:40.731
>> Yeah, the women's room, I'm

11:40.734 --> 11:41.533
sure, is... You blew it.

11:41.535 --> 11:42.233
>> Goddamn it, Cricket.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.068
>> Uh, is it safe?

11:43.070 --> 11:44.069
We're safe to be here?

11:44.071 --> 11:45.236
>> Relax, Cricket, it's safe.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.171
The guy's all docile and shit

11:46.173 --> 11:47.038
now.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.039
He's on these meds, he's...

11:48.041 --> 11:49.074
>> No, look, he-he might look

11:49.076 --> 11:50.709
calm on the outside, but there's

11:50.711 --> 11:51.643
a storm brewing on the inside,

11:51.645 --> 11:52.477
okay?

11:52.479 --> 11:53.311
And I think I know what the

11:53.313 --> 11:54.145
problem is.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.880
>> He's psycho.

11:55.882 --> 11:56.881
>> He's straight-up possessed by

11:56.883 --> 11:58.650
the devil.

11:58.652 --> 12:00.151
>> Okay, you lost me.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.252
>> Okay, think about it.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.520
He used to be fun crazy.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.271
You know?

12:03.272 --> 12:04.021
And the devil was like, "I like

12:04.024 --> 12:04.856
this dude!

12:04.858 --> 12:05.890
I'm gonna get involved!"

12:05.892 --> 12:07.358
He jumps in there, makes him

12:07.360 --> 12:09.427
evil crazy, then the meds get

12:09.429 --> 12:10.495
thrown on top.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.429
They shut everybody down.

12:11.431 --> 12:12.430
>> Yeah.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.865
>> Okay...

12:13.867 --> 12:14.766
All right, so where you...

12:14.768 --> 12:15.700
where you going with that?

12:15.702 --> 12:17.335
>> We gotta get him off the meds

12:17.337 --> 12:18.737
and get the devil out.

12:18.739 --> 12:19.704
>> You want to do an exorcism?

12:19.706 --> 12:20.538
>> Of course I want to do an

12:20.540 --> 12:21.506
exorcism. That's what the...

12:21.508 --> 12:22.273
(laughing)

12:22.275 --> 12:23.208
>> That's where I come in.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.109
>> I was hoping... why didn't

12:24.111 --> 12:25.043
you just come right out here and

12:25.045 --> 12:26.044
be like, "Let's do an exorcism"?

12:26.046 --> 12:27.011
>> I-I can't lead with the

12:27.013 --> 12:27.779
exorcism.

12:27.780 --> 12:28.546
>> All right, so we'll get the

12:28.548 --> 12:29.581
demon and we'll get the goblin

12:29.583 --> 12:30.548
out and then we'll have our fun

12:30.550 --> 12:31.299
Pete back.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.049
>> Oh, yeah, I want to get the

12:32.052 --> 12:32.917
demon out but, uh, not-not a

12:32.919 --> 12:33.685
goblin.

12:33.686 --> 12:34.452
>> Oh, we should get 'em all

12:34.454 --> 12:35.353
out. Get the demon, the goblin,

12:35.355 --> 12:36.254
the ghoul and then you got Pete.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.355
>> Well, no, no, no, no.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.423
There's no goblins, there's no

12:38.425 --> 12:40.058
ghouls, it's just demons, okay?

12:40.060 --> 12:41.025
>> Well, they're all made up,

12:41.027 --> 12:41.960
so...

12:41.962 --> 12:42.961
>> That's why he burned your

12:42.963 --> 12:44.028
face, you son of a bitch!

12:44.030 --> 12:45.063
>> Yeah, yeah, that's true, man!

12:45.065 --> 12:46.030
>> Okay, look, I'm getting hot.

12:46.032 --> 12:46.798
I'm getting too hot.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.699
>> Yeah, we're getting hot.

12:47.701 --> 12:48.700
>> Let's just go get the

12:48.702 --> 12:49.400
exorcism going.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.368
>> All right, yeah, and let's

12:50.370 --> 12:51.803
get you, like, a hat or a hood

12:51.805 --> 12:52.871
or...

12:52.873 --> 12:55.140
♪ ♪

12:55.142 --> 12:56.040
>> All right, now, listen.

12:56.042 --> 12:56.875
Let me talk to this doctor,

12:56.877 --> 12:57.642
okay?

12:57.644 --> 12:58.710
I'll explain to him that we have

12:58.712 --> 12:59.577
a-a dangerous psychopath in our

12:59.579 --> 13:01.045
bar and he could snap at any

13:01.047 --> 13:01.913
minute.

13:01.915 --> 13:02.914
And because there are no

13:02.916 --> 13:03.915
facilities to lock him in, we

13:03.917 --> 13:04.883
need to get him his medication

13:04.885 --> 13:05.950
as soon as possible, in order to

13:05.952 --> 13:06.951
avoid a massacre.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.153
> No. No, no, no, no, no.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.420
Just let me handle this, okay?

13:09.422 --> 13:10.588
I'll act crazy and then he'll

13:10.590 --> 13:11.823
prescribe them to me.

13:11.825 --> 13:12.657
>> You will sit here and you

13:12.659 --> 13:13.324
will be quiet.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.159
Your bad acting will only

13:14.161 --> 13:15.226
confuse him and it will

13:15.228 --> 13:16.127
infuriate me.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.162
>> I'm gonna ask him about the

13:17.164 --> 13:17.996
frog kid.

13:17.998 --> 13:18.763
>> Don't do that.

13:18.765 --> 13:19.397
>> Oh, my God.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.064
>> Mm-hmm.

13:20.066 --> 13:20.765
>> Don't do that.

13:20.767 --> 13:21.599
>> No, Froggy and I need each

13:21.601 --> 13:22.300
other.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.168
He's out there all alone.

13:23.170 --> 13:23.802
>> You...

13:23.804 --> 13:24.636
>> I'm gonna find Froggy.

13:24.638 --> 13:25.503
>> You are never gonna be able

13:25.505 --> 13:26.437
to find a goddamn frog person,

13:26.439 --> 13:27.238
okay?

13:27.240 --> 13:28.072
>> I'm gonna find him.

13:28.074 --> 13:28.823
>> Guys, please.

13:28.824 --> 13:29.573
Just let let me handle it.

13:29.576 --> 13:30.408
I got it. I got it.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.076
>> Hello, thank you for waiting.

13:32.078 --> 13:32.977
I'm Dr. Coleman.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.145
How can I help you today?

13:34.147 --> 13:34.979
>> Yes.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.147
Do you have some sort of donkey

13:36.149 --> 13:37.448
brain database?

13:37.450 --> 13:38.316
>> No.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.450
>> I'm looking for a kid,

13:39.452 --> 13:41.019
the frog kid.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.420
Just search for any half-man,

13:42.422 --> 13:43.688
half-amphibious creature.

13:43.690 --> 13:44.522
>> Yeah, okay, no.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.590
That's not why we're here,

13:45.592 --> 13:46.441
Doctor.

13:46.442 --> 13:47.291
>> (Southern accent): Doctor...

13:47.294 --> 13:48.993
I've always relied upon the

13:48.995 --> 13:50.495
kindness of strangers.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.462
>> What is... what are you do...

13:51.464 --> 13:52.463
What is that,<i> A Streetcar Named</i>

13:52.465 --> 13:53.464
<i> Desire?</i>

13:53.466 --> 13:54.632
>> I'm in desperate need of

13:54.634 --> 13:56.034
medical intervention.

13:56.036 --> 13:59.370
You see, years ago I tried to

13:59.372 --> 14:01.806
burn my college roommate down to

14:01.808 --> 14:03.775
the box springs whilst she was

14:03.777 --> 14:04.542
sleeping.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.779
And now... I have a hankering to

14:07.781 --> 14:10.381
do it again.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.350
>> Dr. Zimmerman!

14:12.352 --> 14:13.484
>> Excuse me?

14:13.486 --> 14:15.720
>> Dr. Albert Zimmerman.

14:15.722 --> 14:16.888
The old bastard who ran the

14:16.890 --> 14:18.223
nitwit farm.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.190
He'll know where Froggy is.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.191
I'll find him...

14:20.193 --> 14:21.226
>> Yeah.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.227
>> ...I'll find the frog kid.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.194
>> Yeah, go find him.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.195
>> I'm gonna find him.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.396
>> Uh, I'm not sure I understand

14:25.398 --> 14:26.831
what's happening.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.132
>> I'm schizophrenic.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.133
>> Dee?

14:29.135 --> 14:30.134
>> Hmm?

14:30.136 --> 14:31.069
>> I swear you would be of more

14:31.071 --> 14:32.370
use to me if I skinned you and

14:32.372 --> 14:33.371
turned your skin into a

14:33.373 --> 14:34.572
lampshade.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.640
Or fashioned you into a piece of

14:35.642 --> 14:36.574
high-end luggage.

14:36.576 --> 14:37.642
I can even add you to my

14:37.644 --> 14:38.910
collection!

14:38.912 --> 14:40.578
>> Are you saying that you have

14:40.580 --> 14:41.846
a collection of skin luggage?

14:41.848 --> 14:43.081
>> Of course I'm not, Dee.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.148
Don't be ridiculous.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.083
Think of the smell.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.150
You haven't thought of the

14:46.152 --> 14:47.218
smell, you bitch!

14:47.220 --> 14:49.187
Now, you say another word and I

14:49.189 --> 14:50.588
swear to God I will dice you

14:50.590 --> 14:53.024
into a million little pieces.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.393
And put those pieces in a box.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.595
A glass box...

14:57.597 --> 14:59.030
that I will display on my

14:59.032 --> 15:01.466
mantel.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.036
All right.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.070
Now that that's settled, we can

15:06.072 --> 15:07.772
have a normal conversation.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.007
Now, Doctor, I'm here to talk to

15:09.009 --> 15:10.375
you about a man.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.910
A very dangerous and very

15:11.912 --> 15:14.078
unstable man.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.849
(classical piano music playing)

15:17.851 --> 15:20.251
>> Dr. Zimmerman?

15:23.857 --> 15:26.591
>> Yeah?

15:26.593 --> 15:27.792
>> It's me.

15:27.794 --> 15:30.128
Don't you recognize me?

15:30.130 --> 15:32.063
>> Yes, yes.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.565
Of course I recognize you.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.935
>> Good, 'cause I got questions.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.037
What did you do with him?

15:39.039 --> 15:40.738
Where is he?

15:40.740 --> 15:42.140
>> Where is who?

15:42.142 --> 15:43.608
>> The frog kid.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.443
Froggy!

15:45.445 --> 15:47.245
Aw, God, Doc!

15:47.247 --> 15:48.947
I got to find him!

15:48.949 --> 15:51.950
>> But I don't understand...

15:51.952 --> 15:53.051
>> I got to know where he is,

15:53.053 --> 15:54.118
Doc, because I got to help him!

15:54.120 --> 15:56.120
I-I owe him that much!

15:56.122 --> 15:57.889
>> But, Franklin...

15:57.891 --> 15:59.624
>> Yes?

15:59.626 --> 16:03.594
>> ...you are Froggy.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.463
>> Huh?

16:05.465 --> 16:06.597
>> I pledge allegiance to the

16:07.634 --> 16:08.666
America...

16:08.668 --> 16:10.268

16:10.270 --> 16:13.304
You are the frog kid!

16:14.808 --> 16:16.674
(frog croaking)

16:16.676 --> 16:19.010
You were an outcast as a child,

16:19.012 --> 16:20.678
so you created an imaginary

16:20.680 --> 16:22.580
friend.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.148
>> It's okay, Froggy.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.117

16:33.126 --> 16:36.961

16:40.967 --> 16:42.867

16:42.869 --> 16:46.204
I remember that now.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.539
What are you doing?

16:48.541 --> 16:50.808
>> You're having an episode

16:50.810 --> 16:52.710
again, Frank, aren't you?

16:52.712 --> 16:54.545
We got to catch the little

16:54.547 --> 16:55.713
froggy.

16:55.715 --> 16:56.848

16:56.850 --> 16:58.049
Get out of here!

16:58.051 --> 16:59.384
>> Here we go, come on...

16:59.386 --> 17:00.651
>> I'm not sick anymore!

17:00.653 --> 17:01.686
I'm not a frog!

17:01.688 --> 17:02.854
I know I'm not a frog!

17:02.856 --> 17:03.855

17:03.857 --> 17:05.890
We have to catch the froggy.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.331
Um, crucifix.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.332

17:14.334 --> 17:15.366
>> Got that.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.334
Holy water-- we got that.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.335
>> Yeah, we got all the stuff.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.369
We got the straps.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.337
We got everything, man.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.238
>> Okay.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.172
>> So, what's the plan?

17:21.174 --> 17:22.240
We're just gonna, like, bum-rush

17:22.242 --> 17:23.241
this guy from behind or what?

17:23.243 --> 17:24.208
>> Whoa, whoa, guys, come on.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.209
No one is taking me from behind,

17:25.211 --> 17:26.344
all right?

17:26.346 --> 17:27.845
Unless you have crack.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.013
If you have crack, let's boogie.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.014
>> No one is going into your

17:30.016 --> 17:31.015
asshole.

17:31.017 --> 17:32.016
>> I wouldn't let them

17:32.018 --> 17:32.850
without the crack.

17:32.852 --> 17:33.851
>> Can we just...?

17:33.853 --> 17:34.719
>> Um, yeah.

17:34.721 --> 17:35.720
>> Let's go through the basic

17:35.722 --> 17:36.521

17:36.523 --> 17:37.555
Uh, talk a bunch of Latin.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.389
>> Yeah, that's me.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.390
I'll fake it.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.391
>> Wait, what do you mean

17:40.393 --> 17:41.192
you'll fake it?

17:41.194 --> 17:42.226
You don't, you don't know your

17:42.228 --> 17:43.194
Latin anymore...?

17:43.196 --> 17:44.228
>> No, no. Don't worry about it.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.229
I can sell anything, you know?

17:45.231 --> 17:46.264
You know how many times I fake

17:46.266 --> 17:47.265
on the streets?

17:47.267 --> 17:48.399
You know? You have to fake.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.367
The guys that don't fake,

17:49.369 --> 17:50.368
they're the ones that get it

17:50.370 --> 17:51.402
the worst.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.403
>> Cricket, just like anything

17:52.405 --> 17:54.005
we can do to have you not talk

17:54.007 --> 17:55.506
about, like, sucking penises or

17:55.508 --> 17:57.575
getting raped in the butt...

17:57.577 --> 17:59.277
>> It just keeps popping up.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.278
>> Oh! Oh!

18:00.280 --> 18:02.180
Hey, I got it. Problem solved.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.114
I got Pete's drugs.

18:03.116 --> 18:04.182
>> Oh, we got drugs?

18:04.184 --> 18:05.116
All right, crank me up, baby!

18:05.118 --> 18:06.184
We going up? Down?

18:06.186 --> 18:07.018
How we doing this, huh?

18:07.020 --> 18:07.952

18:07.954 --> 18:08.853
Oh, God!

18:08.855 --> 18:09.787
>> Uh-oh!

18:09.789 --> 18:10.688
>> Cricket! (groans)

18:10.690 --> 18:11.689
>> Oh, the face? Yeah, sorry.

18:11.691 --> 18:12.623
>> Jesus Christ! That is gross,

18:12.625 --> 18:13.524
man! What the hell?!

18:13.526 --> 18:14.392
>> God's wrath.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.293
>> He had some sort of, like,

18:15.295 --> 18:16.127
Thanksgiving incident.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.061
He went to some, like, party...

18:17.063 --> 18:17.895
>> Yeah, at your house!

18:17.897 --> 18:18.646
Everyone was there!

18:18.647 --> 18:19.396
How do you not remember this?

18:19.399 --> 18:20.264
>> I don't have a house!

18:20.266 --> 18:21.132
>> No, you were not at our

18:21.134 --> 18:22.033
place 'cause we would not

18:22.035 --> 18:22.867
have invited you to our

18:22.869 --> 18:23.801
Thanksgiving thing.

18:23.803 --> 18:24.635
>> No. That's awful.

18:24.637 --> 18:25.703
>> Never mind. Doesn't matter.

18:25.705 --> 18:26.704
>> How the hell did you get

18:26.706 --> 18:27.538
drugs for Pete?

18:27.540 --> 18:28.473
>> Well, I had a simple

18:28.475 --> 18:29.540
conversation with a reasonable

18:29.542 --> 18:30.575
man and that man wrote me a

18:30.577 --> 18:31.709
prescription.

18:31.711 --> 18:32.710
>> Mm, yeah. He got the drugs by

18:32.712 --> 18:33.744
being a real-life actual

18:33.746 --> 18:34.779
psychopath.

18:34.781 --> 18:35.813
>> (chuckles) She keeps...

18:35.815 --> 18:36.781
Uh, no... ridiculous, okay?

18:36.783 --> 18:37.782
No, the man asked me a few

18:37.784 --> 18:38.783
questions.

18:38.785 --> 18:39.784
>> Mm-hmm.

18:39.786 --> 18:40.785
>> I answered those questions as

18:40.787 --> 18:41.652
honestly as I could.

18:41.654 --> 18:42.620
>> Right.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.654
>> Next thing I know I'm walking

18:43.656 --> 18:44.489
out the door with meds for

18:44.491 --> 18:45.556
borderline personality disorder.

18:45.558 --> 18:46.491
>> Yup.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.558
>> You see? That's how you get

18:47.560 --> 18:48.392
shit done, Dee.

18:48.394 --> 18:49.327
>> No, no. That's how you get

18:49.329 --> 18:50.394
diagnosed.

18:50.396 --> 18:51.329
>> Where is he? Where's Pete?

18:51.331 --> 18:52.330
>> Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

18:52.332 --> 18:53.397
>> Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

18:53.399 --> 18:54.398
>> I'm gonna put him out of his

18:54.400 --> 18:55.333
misery!

18:55.335 --> 18:56.400
>> No, no! Frank, Frank! We're

18:56.402 --> 18:57.335
gonna help this guy, all right?

18:57.337 --> 18:58.336
>> But there's no helping him,

18:58.338 --> 18:59.337
Dennis-- don't you understand?

18:59.339 --> 19:00.638
I know. I'm the frog kid, right?

19:00.640 --> 19:01.906
It was all in my mind, but I got

19:01.908 --> 19:03.341
cured.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.575
But I could have another

19:04.577 --> 19:05.843
episode.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.111
So if I had another episode,

19:07.113 --> 19:08.079
what do I do?

19:08.081 --> 19:09.113
I eat a couple of flies.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.414
If he has another episode, he

19:10.416 --> 19:11.516
kills us. He's a murderer!

19:11.518 --> 19:12.517
>> Uh...

19:12.519 --> 19:13.584
>> Dude, dude!

19:13.586 --> 19:14.585
>> No, I'm not.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.786
>> Huh?

19:15.788 --> 19:17.321
>> I'm-I'm not a murderer.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.589
>> That's just what a murderer

19:18.591 --> 19:19.590
would say.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.591
>> No, no, no, really.

19:20.593 --> 19:21.592
All that stuff with my family?

19:21.594 --> 19:22.627
It's just, it's just a rumor

19:22.629 --> 19:23.761

19:23.763 --> 19:25.029
You know, kind of like all the

19:25.031 --> 19:26.097
rumors you guys started about

19:26.099 --> 19:27.098
me?

19:27.100 --> 19:28.099
>> What rumors?

19:28.101 --> 19:29.100
What are you talking about?

19:29.102 --> 19:30.101
>> You know, that I'm crazy and

19:30.103 --> 19:31.269
stuff.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.370
>> Well, yeah, uh, crazy

19:32.372 --> 19:33.371
awesome, you know...

19:33.373 --> 19:34.372
>> Like crazy bad-ass!

19:34.374 --> 19:35.373
>> Yeah, except-except none of

19:35.375 --> 19:36.374
it was true, and then the more

19:36.376 --> 19:37.375
people spread it around, the

19:37.377 --> 19:38.643
more afraid people were of me.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.044
>> Well, wait a second.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.112
Then why did you get sent to a

19:41.114 --> 19:42.446
mental institution?

19:43.550 --> 19:44.949

19:47.687 --> 19:49.287
