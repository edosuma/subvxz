WEBVTT

00:01.205 --> 00:03.802
So remember,
we're done apologizing to Riley.

00:03.891 --> 00:05.619
If she want take us back
simply because

00:05.620 --> 00:08.213
I had sex with her mother,
then that's her problem.

00:10.443 --> 00:13.257
We are so done with the "I'm sorry"s.

00:13.469 --> 00:16.589
- Knock-knock.
- Riley, I'm sorry!

00:17.578 --> 00:19.738
<i>Stop judging me.</i>

00:19.893 --> 00:21.837
I've just came back to drop
this briefcase off for your mom,

00:21.940 --> 00:23.792
she wants to borrow for something, but

00:23.881 --> 00:26.232
let's be honest, I'll never see it again.

00:27.004 --> 00:29.406
Shacka-lacka, huh?

00:29.440 --> 00:34.377
Fresh off the presses.
Bonnie Wheeler, real estate associate.

00:34.412 --> 00:37.518
Hot properties from a hot property.

00:39.584 --> 00:42.452
That slogan's just temporary, right?

00:43.086 --> 00:46.389
No, I have found my true calling.

00:46.424 --> 00:50.393
Brad talked me up with his boss,
and they're gonna take me on.

00:50.428 --> 00:51.661
Mrs. Wheeler, are you
sure it's a good idea

00:51.696 --> 00:53.363
to work under someone you're dating?

00:53.397 --> 00:55.599
Oh, I don't work under Brad...

00:55.633 --> 00:57.367
at the office.

01:00.471 --> 01:02.339
No, my boss is a woman.

01:02.373 --> 01:05.507
Which means I don't have
to sleep my way to the top.

01:05.543 --> 01:10.380
Huh.
I wonder how you do get to the top.

01:10.414 --> 01:13.516
Mom, this is your third
true calling in a year.

01:13.551 --> 01:16.625
At this point, just let
those calls go to voicemail.

01:17.388 --> 01:20.223
Wow, way to support the
women in your life, Ben.

01:20.258 --> 01:21.524
Thanks, Riley.

01:21.559 --> 01:23.360
So you'll come to my
first open house today?

01:23.394 --> 01:25.341
Oh, god, no. I actually
have a real career.

01:25.376 --> 01:26.463
Okay.

01:26.497 --> 01:30.533
The firm has put me on a
very important case. Yeah.

01:30.568 --> 01:33.670
We are representing Reverend Stockwell.

01:33.704 --> 01:36.239
Oh my god, that big
Sunday morning TV preacher?

01:36.274 --> 01:37.674
The guy who ripped off
his entire congregation?

01:37.708 --> 01:41.544
Yeah, yeah, he's guilty as sin.

01:41.579 --> 01:43.248
Allegedly.

01:45.249 --> 01:47.617
So, Benji, about my open house...

01:47.652 --> 01:49.552
I'm not stealing wine and
cheese from the bar again.

01:49.587 --> 01:52.489
Oh, come on.
That was for the church potluck.

01:54.425 --> 01:57.327
Mom, when you stay at a
career longer than it takes

01:57.361 --> 01:59.596
for a banana to ripen,
then I'll help you out.

02:01.198 --> 02:04.567
Well, I would like to thank you
for once again proving to me

02:04.602 --> 02:08.538
that you are nothing but an
ungrateful, unsupportive son.

02:08.572 --> 02:10.240
Okay, but you know what?
That's okay.

02:10.274 --> 02:11.408
Because I don't need your help.

02:11.442 --> 02:14.244
I am a professional woman

02:14.278 --> 02:17.447
who can stand on her own
two feet, okay? Yeah.

02:17.481 --> 02:20.183
Oh, god... oh!

02:22.386 --> 02:25.322
<i>♪ It's amazing how the unexpected ♪</i>

<i>Unsupportive?</i>

02:34.332 --> 02:37.267
Nothing says supportive like
six bottles of half drunk wine,

and some almost perfectly good shrimp.

02:39.303 --> 02:43.440
Thanks to me, your grandma's gonna
get this place rented in no time.

02:43.474 --> 02:45.542
I cannot wait to see
the look on her face.

02:47.578 --> 02:48.545
All right, let's go.

All right.

03:10.534 --> 03:13.503
 Loser.

03:13.537 --> 03:16.339
Hey, what are you ready to suck at next?

03:16.374 --> 03:18.508
Excuse me, but I believe we're tied.

03:18.542 --> 03:21.511
Beer chugging, me.
Basketball, me.

03:21.545 --> 03:24.180
Miniature golf, you.

03:24.215 --> 03:26.383
For obvious reasons.

03:26.417 --> 03:29.252
All right, no.
We need a tiebreaker.

03:29.886 --> 03:34.357
- Oh, how about women?
- Oh, hell to the no!

03:34.392 --> 03:36.192
No, uh-uh. No, no.

03:36.227 --> 03:37.460
I am not going up against

03:37.495 --> 03:40.296
"hey, I'm Danny Wheeler,
New York Ranger.

03:40.331 --> 03:42.298
Mind if I take my shirt off?"

03:43.567 --> 03:46.536
Fine.
What about no women?

03:46.570 --> 03:49.372
No hitting on, hustling, or hooking up.

03:49.407 --> 03:51.641
That's an interesting challenge.

03:51.675 --> 03:57.480
All about self-control.
Something I have in buckets.

03:57.515 --> 03:58.681
All right, what's the wager?

03:58.716 --> 04:01.317
Well, this is a tough one,

04:01.352 --> 04:04.521
so I feel the reward
should be substantial.

04:04.855 --> 04:07.524
As big as that word is for you?

04:08.558 --> 04:12.295
Bigger. Whoever caves first
pays the other's bar tab.

04:12.329 --> 04:13.496
Oh, you are on.

04:13.531 --> 04:16.632
Nobody is better at not
getting women than me.

04:22.206 --> 04:25.208
Is this a bar?

04:25.242 --> 04:29.179
I've never been allowed
in one of these before.

04:29.213 --> 04:31.247
Oh, well then, I wouldn't call it a bar.

04:31.282 --> 04:33.416
Especially to your father, the reverend.

04:33.451 --> 04:35.552
Uh, let's go with
"eating establishment,"

04:36.586 --> 04:38.254
With lots of liquor.

04:38.289 --> 04:41.357
Um, would you like something to drink?

04:41.392 --> 04:44.427
Oh, I don't drink.
Liquor is just liquid Satan.

04:44.962 --> 04:47.063
Right.

04:48.566 --> 04:50.567
Oh, god, you're serious.

04:50.601 --> 04:52.569
Yeah, me neither, me neither.

04:52.603 --> 04:54.304
So why don't you have a seat

04:54.338 --> 04:56.539
and try not to talk to
any unsavory characters.

04:56.574 --> 05:00.443
- Okay? There you go.
- Hey, I'm Ben.

05:00.478 --> 05:02.312
Any friend of Riley's
is a friend of mine.

05:02.346 --> 05:04.447
Ben, Piper, Piper, Ben.

05:04.482 --> 05:09.352
And just so you know, this
is an unsavory character.

05:12.356 --> 05:13.523
Excuse me. All right.

05:13.557 --> 05:15.592
Oh my gosh, you guys,
you're not gonna believe it.

05:15.626 --> 05:17.360
Huge honor.

05:17.394 --> 05:20.230
I have been entrusted to
guard the reverend's daughter.

05:20.297 --> 05:21.531
Yeah, the firm is depending on me

05:21.565 --> 05:23.533
to keep her away from
the press until Monday,

05:23.567 --> 05:26.336
because they are just
obsessed with this case,

05:26.370 --> 05:28.438
and any story that
they can get on Piper.

05:28.472 --> 05:32.642
- So you're baby-sitting?
- Yeah, pretty much.

05:33.076 --> 05:35.645
Yeah, well just keep that
tucker-sized temptress

05:35.679 --> 05:39.282
- away from us.
- We just swore off women.

05:39.316 --> 05:42.352
Well, on behalf of my gender, thank you.

05:42.386 --> 05:44.521
But you know, I don't think
it's gonna be a problem

05:44.555 --> 05:46.623
because I'm pretty sure
she's sworn off men.

05:46.657 --> 05:48.491
You might want to go tell Ben.

05:48.526 --> 05:49.492
<i>What? No. No no no.</i>

05:49.527 --> 05:51.361
No no no.
Piper, Piper!

05:51.395 --> 05:54.230
No no no no.
There is alcohol in this.

05:54.265 --> 05:57.233
I did not ask for a "sin and tonic."

05:58.636 --> 06:01.237
What is wrong with you?

06:06.277 --> 06:07.277
I'm not paying for that.

06:10.414 --> 06:11.481
<i>Bonnie: Oh my god, Ben,</i>

06:11.515 --> 06:14.150
you are never gonna believe
what happened yesterday.

06:14.184 --> 06:16.486
Your open house was a huge success
and you rented your first listing?

06:16.520 --> 06:19.155
Or some idiot left a candle burning

06:19.189 --> 06:21.257
and lit the apartment up like a torch.

06:21.292 --> 06:22.559
Do they know who did it?

06:22.593 --> 06:26.296
- Not a clue.
- Oh, that's a relief.

06:26.330 --> 06:28.431
I mean, I hate to think that
they thought you were responsible.

06:28.465 --> 06:31.167
- They don't, do they?
- Oh, god, no.

06:31.201 --> 06:32.602
Thank goodness my boss is a woman.

06:32.670 --> 06:36.172
When it comes to the work force,
we women stick together.

06:36.206 --> 06:40.276
Unless we're wearing the same outfit.
And then I'll cut a bitch.

06:41.478 --> 06:44.180
We're meeting for lunch.
Oh. There she is.

06:44.214 --> 06:47.216
All right, I'm gonna go freshen up.
Offer her a drink... on me.

06:47.251 --> 06:50.196
- And by on me, you know...
- No, I got it, yeah.

06:51.522 --> 06:54.357
Hey, can I get you something to drink?

06:54.391 --> 06:57.046
You can get me a lot of things.

06:58.295 --> 07:01.397
But the drink will have to do for now.
And nothing too strong.

07:01.432 --> 07:04.253
I like to keep my wits about me
when I fire someone.

07:08.505 --> 07:10.406
You're gonna fire someone?

07:10.441 --> 07:13.476
Yeah, tall blonde.
Goes by Bonnie.

07:13.510 --> 07:17.280
Though that stupid boy toy of hers
insists on calling her Bon-bon,

07:17.314 --> 07:19.182
to which I say Barf-barf.

07:20.250 --> 07:24.520
- Why, you know her?
- Yeah, and I call her Mom-mom.

07:24.555 --> 07:28.324
Look, I only took her
on to make Brad happy.

07:28.359 --> 07:32.328
Which is ironic 'cause I only
took Brad on to make me happy.

07:32.363 --> 07:35.164
Just give her a second chance, please.

07:35.199 --> 07:37.567
Ooh-ooh!  I know.
How about you give her another listing?

07:37.601 --> 07:40.403
And if she can't rent it, you're
completely justified in letting her go.

07:40.437 --> 07:42.572
I like the sound of that.

07:42.606 --> 07:47.101
- What, giving her a listing?
- No, being justified in letting her go.

07:48.312 --> 07:52.181
She's got till Monday.
Setting her up to be fired.

07:52.216 --> 07:54.045
Thanks for the idea.

07:54.551 --> 07:57.253
Yeah, don't mention it.

07:57.287 --> 07:59.255
No, but seriously, can
you please not mention it?

08:01.158 --> 08:03.292
All right, this apartment
is a neutral zone.

08:03.327 --> 08:06.262
There will be no women allowed
in here until further notice.

08:06.296 --> 08:08.264
Oh my god,
I need you to watch Piper!

08:08.298 --> 08:10.366
Yeah. She lost her wallet
somewhere between my house and

08:10.367 --> 08:12.435
the bar. And I can't be
walking her all over the city,

08:12.469 --> 08:14.203
because the media
follows her everywhere.

08:14.238 --> 08:16.439
So I will just... I'll be
back as soon as I can, okay?

08:16.473 --> 08:18.945
Thank you thank you thank you.

08:19.543 --> 08:22.578
Don't worry. I'm sure
Riley will find your wallet.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.495
Something tells me that she won't.
Oops.

08:28.419 --> 08:29.485
Should I call Riley?

08:29.520 --> 08:34.357
Why don't you call me a cab
so I can get out of here?

08:36.326 --> 08:41.530
I think that's the exact opposite
of what she wanted us to do.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.142
Fine.

08:45.369 --> 08:49.172
Then here's how it's gonna go down.

08:49.206 --> 08:55.578
You go pour me a drink, you
shuffle the cards, and...

08:57.548 --> 08:59.415
we're gonna play a little game.

09:04.321 --> 09:06.556
<i>Bonnie: Holy crap! It's beautiful.</i>

09:06.590 --> 09:09.592
I will be able to rent
this place in no time.

09:09.626 --> 09:11.394
How about we say Monday?

09:11.428 --> 09:13.563
It's always good to have a goal.

09:13.597 --> 09:16.265
Two bedrooms, eat-in kitchen.

09:17.501 --> 09:19.469
Oh.

09:19.503 --> 09:24.307
And a view of the cutest
little church in the world.

09:24.341 --> 09:27.443
I won't need any help with this one.

09:27.478 --> 09:31.698
Oh my god! 
What the f... ?!

09:37.859 --> 09:38.859
All in!

09:46.767 --> 09:48.702
What the hell is wrong with you two?!

09:48.736 --> 09:52.155
I'm gone for like two
seconds and you try to talk

09:52.156 --> 09:55.575
this poor girl into tequila
shots and strip poker?

09:55.610 --> 09:57.644
It's a miracle I ran
into her on the street.

09:57.678 --> 09:59.646
Yeah, it was something.

10:04.585 --> 10:07.754
Well, hey!
The poker and tequila were her idea!

10:07.788 --> 10:10.957
Really?
You expect me to believe

10:10.992 --> 10:14.962
that this sweet, innocent
young woman drank you

10:14.963 --> 10:18.932
both under the table, took
your pants, and ran off?

10:18.966 --> 10:22.669
Why not?
It's happened before!

10:23.530 --> 10:25.959
Okay, Piper, just get
your stuff and we're...

10:26.941 --> 10:28.942
It's my doorman.

10:28.976 --> 10:31.578
Hello? Hi, yeah.

10:31.612 --> 10:33.914
What?
You're kidding me.

10:33.948 --> 10:35.715
No, no no no, it's fine.

10:35.750 --> 10:37.817
Okay, thank you.

10:37.852 --> 10:40.620
Well, there are a dozen
photographers outside my building.

10:40.655 --> 10:41.955
Somebody tipped them off.

10:41.989 --> 10:44.940
Gosh, oh gum.

10:45.626 --> 10:47.861
Now who would do that?

10:47.895 --> 10:52.599
- What do we do now?
- Well, no one knows I'm here,

10:52.633 --> 10:56.703
and I'm sure that
the boys have learned their lesson.

11:01.909 --> 11:05.845
So, why don't you just sign the
lease and I'll fill in the rest?

11:05.880 --> 11:07.614
Three, two.

11:16.757 --> 11:17.891
Ohh!

11:17.925 --> 11:19.859
Gosh, I just... I don't understand

11:19.894 --> 11:23.797
why Carol would stick me
with such a dog of a listing.

11:23.831 --> 11:27.867
Oh, wait a minute.
I know what's going on here?

11:27.902 --> 11:30.570
- You do?
- Yeah.

11:30.605 --> 11:32.872
A little rookie hazing.

11:32.907 --> 11:37.577
Oh, man, that Carol!
What a jokester.

11:37.645 --> 11:38.979
Oh, man. I just love her.

11:39.013 --> 11:41.648
Mom, Carol said that if you
don't rent this apartment

11:41.682 --> 11:42.749
she's gonna fire you.

11:42.783 --> 11:45.084
That backstabbing whore!
I hate her!

11:45.853 --> 11:47.587
What, is it because of the fire?

11:47.622 --> 11:50.924
No, it's not because of the fire.
Remember that.

11:50.958 --> 11:54.060
The problem is you and Brad.
She's jealous.

11:54.095 --> 11:57.881
Really?
I love having a boyfriend

11:57.882 --> 11:59.799
that pisses off other women.

11:59.834 --> 12:02.769
Yes, that would be the
positive spin on all this.

12:02.803 --> 12:05.672
But if you don't rent this apartment,
you're gonna lose your job.

12:05.706 --> 12:08.658
Yeah, well, unless the next
person that walks through

12:08.659 --> 12:11.611
that door has a hump and
a second home in Notre Dame,

12:11.646 --> 12:13.324
I don't feel very optimistic!

12:15.596 --> 12:18.799
- Do you have any fives?
- Go fish.

12:18.833 --> 12:22.669
- Isn't this fun?
- So much.

12:22.703 --> 12:26.440
But I'm feeling really guilty
about making you stay in,

12:26.474 --> 12:28.575
so if you want to go out,
I won't tell.

12:28.609 --> 12:30.377
I mean, you must have
a ton of guys after you.

12:30.411 --> 12:35.348
Well, yeah.
But I'm not really into that right now.

12:35.383 --> 12:37.469
I'm kind of getting over someone.

12:37.890 --> 12:40.821
Yes, just the woman I was looking for.
We have got to talk.

12:40.855 --> 12:42.656
Ben, we have been through this, okay?

12:42.690 --> 12:44.591
You can beg and plead all you want,

12:44.625 --> 12:49.562
but we are not getting back together.
See what I'm dealing with?

12:50.465 --> 12:53.800
Okay, first of all, we are not done.
And second, I was talking to Piper.

12:55.570 --> 12:57.471
So I had this brilliant idea.

12:57.505 --> 13:00.307
Okay, you could be in town for months
because of this trial thing, right?

13:00.341 --> 13:03.610
My Mom has an apartment near
a church she needs to rent.

13:03.644 --> 13:08.040
Seems to me like, dare I say,
a match made in heaven?

13:08.783 --> 13:11.651
- Can we go look at it? Now?
- Yeah, let's go.

13:11.686 --> 13:13.386
No no no. No no no.

13:13.421 --> 13:14.654
No one is going anywhere, okay?

13:16.524 --> 13:18.458
It's the office. Once
again checking in on me

13:18.526 --> 13:20.460
like I'm some sort of
crazy, incompetent...

13:20.495 --> 13:24.831
Oh, hey, hey.
Sorry, I didn't realize I'd hit "answer."

13:24.866 --> 13:28.468
Okay, so we're just gonna go in
the back where no one can hear us.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.370
Yeah, and I'm just... I'm
gonna go to the kitchen

13:30.404 --> 13:31.538
for a totally unrelated reason.

13:31.572 --> 13:33.507
No no no. No.
You can tell the reverend

13:33.541 --> 13:36.510
that everything is
going great, thank god.

13:36.544 --> 13:38.478
Oh my god, are you serious?

13:38.513 --> 13:40.413
You think you and your dad might
really want to rent the apartment?

13:40.448 --> 13:44.518
Well, I know that it'd be the
answer to some of my recent prayers.

13:44.552 --> 13:48.157
But I think you're gonna have to sneak
me out of here in order to see it.

13:48.225 --> 13:50.457
No, I can't. Riley would
never speak to me again.

13:50.491 --> 13:53.360
Oh, please.
She's so in love with you.

13:53.394 --> 13:54.794
And plus, she never has to know.

13:54.829 --> 13:56.763
I'm sorry, can you
rewind there for a second?

13:56.797 --> 13:58.665
- Riley what?
- Never needs to know?

13:58.699 --> 14:00.534
- No, the other part.
- Is in love with you?

14:00.568 --> 14:01.535
Yeah, that's the one!

14:01.569 --> 14:05.863
Well, you're pretty much
all she talks about. Um...

14:06.340 --> 14:08.475
So what do you say I scratch
your back and you scratch mine?

14:08.509 --> 14:12.757
Hey, look, I'm totally flattered
and you're cute, but

14:12.792 --> 14:15.448
I think I should see where
this whole Riley thing goes first.

14:16.316 --> 14:19.619
Yeah. I actually meant that
I'll help you get Riley back

14:19.654 --> 14:22.489
- if you show me the apartment.
- Oh, deal.

14:22.523 --> 14:25.725
But we probably shouldn't
tell Riley that you hit on me.

14:29.319 --> 14:31.566
Okay, this is what we'll do.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.601
I'll tell Riley that you're taking a nap
and I have to work an extra shift.

14:33.635 --> 14:34.836
You sneak out of my bedroom window

14:34.870 --> 14:37.538
across the fire escape,
and we'll meet in the lobby.

14:37.573 --> 14:39.507
Or we could just walk
out the front door.

14:39.541 --> 14:40.942
I don't see her. I think
she went in the bathroom.

14:40.976 --> 14:42.677
Oh, let's go.

14:42.711 --> 14:44.946
Okay, Riley, Piper's taking a nap

14:44.980 --> 14:46.848
and I'm running to work.
Okay, see you.

14:46.882 --> 14:49.367
I swear, the second that
crazy preacher gets sent up

14:49.368 --> 14:51.853
the river and I make
partner, I am firing everyone.

14:51.887 --> 14:54.188
This thing is still on?!

14:55.924 --> 14:58.926
Okay, so Piper wanted me to let
you know that she's taking a nap.

14:58.961 --> 15:01.462
She said to wake her
up in about two hours.

15:01.497 --> 15:03.464
I'd say three just to be safe, but

15:03.499 --> 15:06.467
I'm gonna run to
work, so I'll see you.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.575
- Are we gonna ignore this?
- Yep.

15:14.610 --> 15:15.810
- Are we gonna get blamed for this?
- Yep.

15:15.844 --> 15:18.058
Are we gonna call off the bet
and declare me the winner?

15:18.093 --> 15:19.449
Nice try.

15:21.850 --> 15:23.484
So just get Piper to sign the lease,

15:23.519 --> 15:24.752
and then Carol can't fire you.

15:24.787 --> 15:27.855
Oh, I hope your little church mouse
doesn't mind loud music.

15:27.890 --> 15:29.690
Somebody in this
building likes to party.

15:29.725 --> 15:32.493
<i>Drink drink drink drink!</i>

15:32.528 --> 15:36.798
- Piper, what the hell are you doing?!
- Well, thanks to you, I'm losing.

15:36.832 --> 15:40.701
What the hell is wrong with you?
This girl isn't looking for a place.

15:40.736 --> 15:42.904
Well, I might be if you
let me keep partying.

15:42.938 --> 15:45.940
Somebody get this girl a drink.
I need to show her the bedrooms.

15:48.877 --> 15:50.645
You are not showing her anything.

15:50.679 --> 15:52.747
Riley, what the hell are you doing here?

15:52.781 --> 15:54.549
Ben, how could you sneak
her out of the house

15:54.583 --> 15:57.552
and take her to a party
at some random apartment?

15:57.586 --> 15:58.786
Not random.

15:58.821 --> 16:04.625
If she would just sign here,
here, and here, it could be hers.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.761
This isn't my party.
It's her party.

16:06.795 --> 16:09.464
Like I would have a party.

16:09.498 --> 16:13.501
- Oh.
- Oh my god, is this beer?

16:13.535 --> 16:15.570
Well now I'll never get into heaven.

16:15.604 --> 16:18.673
She's lying.
Oh, you're such a little liar.

16:20.509 --> 16:22.810
Riley, you have to believe me.
I could never lie to you.

16:24.847 --> 16:25.913
Piper?

16:28.650 --> 16:31.486
Oh my god!
Okay, yes, yes, it's my party.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.779
Yes, I'm drinking a beer,
and yes, I made a sex tape.

16:36.658 --> 16:39.760
And yes, you probably
didn't need to know that.

16:39.795 --> 16:44.899
Wait, so you've been
playing me all along? Why?

16:44.933 --> 16:49.194
Because if I wasn't playing you,
I'd be stuck playing "Go fish."

16:49.938 --> 16:54.509
Well, well, well.

16:54.543 --> 16:57.778
Is Bon-bon throwing herself
a little going away party?

16:57.813 --> 17:01.549
Because I'd like to be the first to say
"bye-bye."

17:01.583 --> 17:05.553
Carol, I can explain.
Yeah, actually I can't.

17:05.587 --> 17:09.690
- No, you can't fire her.
- Between burning down one listing

17:09.724 --> 17:13.560
and trashing another,
I'm pretty sure I can.

17:13.595 --> 17:14.729
She didn't burn down that apartment.

17:14.762 --> 17:16.631
- I did.
- Yeah. He did.

17:16.665 --> 17:18.733
- Wait, you what?!
- I'm sorry.

17:18.767 --> 17:20.800
And she didn't trash this place.
She did.

17:20.836 --> 17:22.737
Well, you're the one
who brought me here.

17:22.771 --> 17:25.540
Wow, once you start telling the truth,
you just can't stop, can you?

17:26.608 --> 17:29.710
You know what?
Why don't we all just tell the truth.

17:29.745 --> 17:32.813
I love that idea, Mrs. Wheeler,
because I have a lot to say.

17:32.848 --> 17:35.783
This isn't about my job performance.

17:35.817 --> 17:39.554
This is about Brad.
Admit it.

17:39.588 --> 17:44.492
You are nothing but a jealous,
stereotypical, very well dressed bully.

17:44.526 --> 17:47.038
Seriously, where did you get that outfit?!

17:47.796 --> 17:51.866
And you are nothing but a privileged,
whiny, holier than thou hypocrite.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.734
Mm-hmm.
You know what? That is good.

17:53.769 --> 17:57.705
And might I add,
unsupportive backstabber.

17:57.739 --> 17:59.840
You don't give one thought
to other people's feelings

17:59.875 --> 18:01.909
or the ramifications of your actions.

18:01.944 --> 18:05.513
Okay, I'm just gonna let her keep going!

18:05.547 --> 18:09.450
I could lose my job.
Your father could go to prison.

18:09.484 --> 18:11.852
Is having a "good time"
really worth all that?

18:11.887 --> 18:14.622
Okay, that kind of went off the rails.

18:14.656 --> 18:17.625
And to think, you were my role model.

18:17.659 --> 18:19.794
But you know what?
From now on,

18:19.828 --> 18:24.699
I am my own role model.
Here's what's going to happen.

18:24.733 --> 18:28.703
I am going to rent this place
because I believe in myself.

18:28.737 --> 18:32.807
And when I do, you are going
to make me a full-fledged agent.

18:32.841 --> 18:37.678
Or I'll just stick to the original plan
and fire you.

18:37.713 --> 18:40.881
Okay, great.
But just remember wherever I go,

18:40.916 --> 18:44.819
so does your number one realtor.
My boyfriend...

18:44.853 --> 18:46.654
Brad.

18:48.657 --> 18:50.858
- Welcome aboard, Bonnie.
- Oh, yeah.

18:50.892 --> 18:55.663
And as for you, Pi... Piper?
Where is Piper?

18:55.697 --> 18:58.666
So, um, speaking of Piper,

18:58.667 --> 19:01.636
she actually mentioned that you
might still be in love with me.

19:01.670 --> 19:04.966
In case you haven't paid
attention, she's a liar.

19:07.876 --> 19:09.577
Well, just thought I'd swing by

19:09.611 --> 19:11.579
before my last day
as an employed person.

19:12.814 --> 19:14.715
Piper still hasn't shown up.

19:14.750 --> 19:17.451
Riley, I feel like this is all my fault.

19:17.486 --> 19:19.887
This is where you're
supposed to tell me it's not.

19:19.921 --> 19:24.458
It's not.
I really only have myself to blame.

19:24.493 --> 19:25.893
How can I ever make it as a lawyer

19:25.927 --> 19:28.729
if I can't even tell when
someone's lying to my face?

19:28.764 --> 19:31.565
Oh, hey.
Morning, guys.

19:32.734 --> 19:36.637
Here.
A check for your entire bar bill.

19:36.672 --> 19:39.640
I couldn't help myself.
I gave my number to some girl.

19:39.675 --> 19:41.676
You win. I caved.

19:41.710 --> 19:45.579
I accept your concession.
Tough loss, bro.

19:51.787 --> 19:53.287
Piper?

19:54.690 --> 19:58.492
Oh, sorry.
I might have caved a little.

19:58.527 --> 19:59.760
Twice.

20:04.533 --> 20:05.599
Hey.

20:06.868 --> 20:10.604
Um, I probably owe you an apology.

20:10.639 --> 20:13.774
I was being totally selfish
and immature,

20:13.809 --> 20:15.743
and thanks to you
I can see that my actions

20:15.777 --> 20:18.679
really affect other people.
Like you.

20:18.714 --> 20:20.681
I'm sorry.

20:20.716 --> 20:24.919
- That was a complete lie, wasn't it?
- Yeah, he wrote it.

20:26.722 --> 20:28.856
Not bad. But here's
what's gonna happen.

20:28.890 --> 20:30.958
We're gonna go to court,
and you're gonna tell my boss

20:30.992 --> 20:33.594
that I was awesome this weekend.

20:33.628 --> 20:35.629
And if you don't, I'm
gonna tell your dad

20:35.664 --> 20:37.631
every single thing
that you've been up to.

20:37.666 --> 20:38.999
I'll get dressed.

20:40.635 --> 20:43.704
Wow.
Way to argue your case, counselor.

20:43.739 --> 20:45.873
Thank you.
I'm back!

20:45.907 --> 20:47.541
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
So, what do they think?

20:54.001 --> 20:55.768
I think they're gonna take it.

20:57.704 --> 20:59.939
Sister, sister.

20:59.973 --> 21:03.709
- They don't mind the bells?
- Nope.

21:03.744 --> 21:04.877
Oh, right.

21:11.118 --> 21:14.787
God works in mysterious ways.
