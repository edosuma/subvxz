00:56.470 --> 00:59.640
Hey, Jemma.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.180
I know.

01:01.210 --> 01:04.250
I know I'm a little bit older
than I said.

01:04.280 --> 01:05.880
And the pictures...

01:05.920 --> 01:08.550
I was gonna tell you, I just
figured it'd be better to wait

01:08.590 --> 01:10.290
till we met in person.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.560
But everything else
I said is totally true.

01:13.590 --> 01:16.430
I mean, I'm... I'm only 16.

01:16.460 --> 01:18.560
And you're even prettier
than your pictures.

01:18.600 --> 01:22.430
And you're smart,
and you're sophisticated.

01:22.470 --> 01:24.570
Thanks.

01:24.600 --> 01:28.570
We've been talking and texting
for what, five months?

01:29.610 --> 01:30.510
Well, look,

01:30.540 --> 01:31.740
I don't want you to do anything

01:31.780 --> 01:33.280
that you don't want to do.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.710
So you can go back home,

01:34.740 --> 01:37.710
and we can pretend
that this never happened.

01:37.750 --> 01:39.620
We don't even
have to talk anymore.

01:39.650 --> 01:42.490
Or...

01:42.520 --> 01:44.790
you could come to the city
with me, like we planned.

01:44.820 --> 01:46.460
Are you hungry?

01:46.490 --> 01:48.360
You haven't had dinner yet,
have you?

01:48.390 --> 01:49.490
No.
No?

01:49.530 --> 01:52.730
Let's go have a meal,
we'll have a couple of beers,

01:52.760 --> 01:54.730
and, uh, we can
talk things through.

01:54.760 --> 01:58.170
You ever rid in
a sports car before?

01:58.200 --> 01:59.240
:
No.

01:59.270 --> 02:00.370
No?

02:01.410 --> 02:02.610
Well, come on.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.840
Maybe I'll even let you drive.

02:07.580 --> 02:09.949
Yeah?

02:09.979 --> 02:11.320
Okay.

02:11.350 --> 02:13.350
Come on.

02:14.380 --> 02:17.490
Thank you all for coming.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.360
My name is Maya Whitbeck.

02:19.390 --> 02:21.560
I'm Jemma's mother.

02:21.590 --> 02:25.600
She's my only child, and she's
been missing for four days.

02:25.630 --> 02:28.570
Please, if you have
any information

02:28.600 --> 02:31.370
about where she might be,
if you've seen her,

02:31.400 --> 02:34.370
please call 911.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.410
Jemma, honey,
if-if you can hear me,

02:36.440 --> 02:38.380
everyone is looking for you.

02:38.410 --> 02:40.680
I love you. I miss you so much.

02:40.710 --> 02:44.410
I just want you home.

02:44.450 --> 02:46.650
Thank you.

02:46.680 --> 02:47.680
Help me find Jemma.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.390
She's my best friend.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.720
Hey, help me find Jemma.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.500
Everyone, up against the wall!

03:00.530 --> 03:02.830
And hands where
I can see them. Now!

03:12.510 --> 03:13.540
All right, let's go!

03:13.580 --> 03:15.310
Let's go, let's go!

03:15.350 --> 03:16.950
Police! Don't move!

03:16.980 --> 03:18.320
Freeze!

03:18.350 --> 03:20.250
Drop your weapons.
Drop them!

03:20.280 --> 03:23.750
Hands on your head.

03:33.530 --> 03:34.830
Don't say a word.

03:34.860 --> 03:36.300
Okay? Not a word!

03:38.740 --> 03:39.740
My client didn't just...

03:39.770 --> 03:42.570
Oh. Look who it is.

03:42.610 --> 03:44.710
It's Thalia Macera.

03:44.740 --> 03:48.410
She was a 16-year-old child when
she was ripped from her home...

03:48.450 --> 03:49.580
I see her on TV all the time.

03:49.610 --> 03:52.320
That woman loves
a television lens.

03:52.350 --> 03:53.680
Isn't that the victims'
rights attorney?

03:53.720 --> 03:55.590
She is no attorney.

03:55.620 --> 03:58.360
She is a piranha with a license
to practice law.

03:58.390 --> 04:01.590
And now she is being charged
with armed robbery,

04:01.630 --> 04:05.530
and facing 25 years in prison.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.660
Talk about an injustice.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.770
The ADA is the one
who should be in jail

04:09.800 --> 04:13.940
for compounding
this child's trauma.

04:13.970 --> 04:15.640
Thank you.

04:15.670 --> 04:18.610
No one in the DA's
office could stand her.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.810
She alienates everyone
in the courtroom,

04:20.839 --> 04:23.410
and she's never met a
victim she couldn't exploit.

04:23.450 --> 04:24.580
I don't get it.

04:24.610 --> 04:25.850
Why would Bull want
to work with her?

04:25.880 --> 04:27.850
Bull and Thalia go way back.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.320
When he first got out of school
and started to practice

04:30.350 --> 04:32.660
as a forensic psychologist,

04:32.690 --> 04:35.460
Thalia was the first one to hire
him as an expert witness.

04:35.490 --> 04:37.730
It was the first time he ever
set foot in a courtroom.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.630
He says it was love
at first sight.

04:40.660 --> 04:42.700
Uh, the courtroom, not Thalia.

04:42.730 --> 04:44.670
It's gonna be a tough
case to defend.

04:44.700 --> 04:47.000
It's pretty clear that
the girl is guilty.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.910
Well, I'm sure
Bull has a theory, right?

04:48.940 --> 04:51.040
Yeah. His theory is
she did it against her will.

04:51.070 --> 04:53.740
As to the why and the how,
everything is on the table:

04:53.780 --> 04:57.680
brainwashing, exploitation,
manipulation, fear, abuse.

04:57.710 --> 04:59.380
Terrific.

04:59.420 --> 05:01.720
We got a guilty client,
an impossible lawyer...

05:02.750 --> 05:05.560
...and about a half
dozen unproven theories

05:05.590 --> 05:07.720
with which to defend her.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.760
Sounds like a dream come true.

05:27.510 --> 05:28.980
:
You see that?

05:29.010 --> 05:32.480
How quickly Jemma reacted
to Ryan's presence?

05:32.520 --> 05:34.820
He's really got a hold on her.

05:34.850 --> 05:36.820
It's gonna be hard
to make a case

05:36.850 --> 05:38.760
that she did what she
did against her will

05:38.790 --> 05:39.920
when they're whispering
in each other's ears

05:39.960 --> 05:41.690
like co-conspirators.

05:41.730 --> 05:42.890
You want me to go stand
between them?

05:42.930 --> 05:44.730
Could you, would you?

05:44.760 --> 05:46.400
Let's call the next case.

05:46.430 --> 05:50.730
The People v. Jemma Whitbeck
and Ryan Mitchell?

05:50.770 --> 05:51.970
I'll hear you on bail.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.870
Your Honor, Mr. Mitchell
has a criminal record:

05:54.900 --> 05:56.840
assault, fraud, larceny.

05:56.870 --> 05:59.610
Given the incontrovertible
facts of this case,

05:59.640 --> 06:02.480
the people request
$250,000 cash.

06:02.510 --> 06:04.780
Most of those cases you cited
have been dismissed,

06:04.810 --> 06:05.820
and my client has
never defaulted.

06:05.850 --> 06:07.820
I would ask Your Honor

06:07.850 --> 06:10.720
to consider releasing my client
on his own recognizance.

06:10.750 --> 06:12.890
I'm adopting the prosecutor's
recommendation.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.060
250 cash.

06:15.090 --> 06:16.560
What about his friend?

06:16.590 --> 06:19.430
Objection to the use
of the word "friend."

06:19.460 --> 06:20.730
Relax, Ms. Macera.
I'll let you know

06:20.760 --> 06:22.700
when it's your turn.

06:22.730 --> 06:23.830
On the matter
of Ms. Whitbeck,

06:23.870 --> 06:25.800
while she has no
criminal record,

06:25.840 --> 06:28.040
the case against
her is airtight.

06:28.070 --> 06:30.140
She was caught fleeing
the scene of the crime

06:30.170 --> 06:31.910
with the gun in her hand.

06:31.940 --> 06:34.440
The people request bail
in the amount of $100,000.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.150
Your turn, Ms. Macera.

06:36.180 --> 06:38.180
$100,000?

06:38.210 --> 06:39.820
It might as well
be $100 million.

06:39.850 --> 06:40.750
My client can't make that.

06:40.780 --> 06:42.490
What are you asking for?

06:42.520 --> 06:44.850
I'm asking for a
dismissal, and an apology

06:44.890 --> 06:46.160
from the prosecutor.

06:46.190 --> 06:47.720
My client has suffered

06:47.760 --> 06:49.890
unimaginable trauma.

06:49.930 --> 06:52.860
She didn't willfully commit this
crime, and everyone knows that.

06:52.900 --> 06:54.130
No, Ms. Macera.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.570
Everyone doesn't know that.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.670
That's what we're here
to determine.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.800
And for the future...
this is just you and me here...

06:59.840 --> 07:01.240
save the theatrics for the jury.

07:01.270 --> 07:04.010
I'm setting the bail
at $100,000.

07:08.650 --> 07:09.850
Tell the judge we have a motion,

07:09.880 --> 07:11.720
and we need it to be heard
immediately.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.780
Do it now.

07:13.820 --> 07:14.850
Uh, next case.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.620
Excuse me, Your Honor.

07:16.650 --> 07:18.150
I have a motion and
I need to be heard.

07:18.190 --> 07:20.690
It's an urgent matter,
and it cannot wait,

07:20.720 --> 07:21.860
and my client's
constitutional right

07:21.890 --> 07:23.890
to due process is at stake.

07:23.930 --> 07:24.860
Motion to sever?

07:24.890 --> 07:26.730
That's what was so urgent?

07:26.760 --> 07:28.700
I got a courtroom
full of people out there.

07:28.730 --> 07:30.870
Separate trials
are essential to our case.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.740
There are two
inconsistent defenses.

07:33.770 --> 07:36.110
We fully plan on pointing
the finger at Mr. Mitchell.

07:36.140 --> 07:39.810
Your Honor, two trials will be
a waste of time and resources.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.150
Both cases require the same
witnesses, the same evidence.

07:42.180 --> 07:45.010
There's no reason both cases
can't be heard together.

07:45.050 --> 07:47.150
I can give you a couple reasons.

07:47.180 --> 07:49.950
First, if Jemma and Ryan
are seated at the same table,

07:49.990 --> 07:52.260
it will send a subliminal
message to the jurors

07:52.290 --> 07:53.790
that they are a team.

07:53.820 --> 07:55.260
They are a team.

07:55.290 --> 07:58.160
Second, victims of abuse
are more likely to speak freely

07:58.190 --> 08:00.830
if their abuser
is removed from the equation.

08:00.860 --> 08:02.000
Hold on. Abuse?

08:02.030 --> 08:03.700
Where is that coming from?

08:03.730 --> 08:04.870
There's nothing to back that up.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.240
There's no witnesses,

08:06.270 --> 08:07.900
no medical reports
of injuries...

08:07.940 --> 08:10.840
What grounds do you have
to support a claim of abuse?

08:10.870 --> 08:12.940
I have 20 years of experience
working with victims.

08:12.980 --> 08:13.910
Yes.

08:13.940 --> 08:17.850
But do you have anything
tangible to present?

08:17.880 --> 08:19.920
Not just yet, Your Honor.

08:19.950 --> 08:21.050
Because it doesn't exist.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.550
Your Honor, the defendant
was a willing participant

08:23.590 --> 08:24.720
in the robbery.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.260
Your motion to sever is denied.

08:26.290 --> 08:28.590
Without prejudice.
You can refile

08:28.630 --> 08:30.960
if you develop
concrete evidence of abuse.

08:30.990 --> 08:34.830
But until then,
it's two defendants, one trial.

08:34.860 --> 08:36.830
Good to have her back, huh?

08:36.870 --> 08:38.100
I had to drain her college fund,

08:38.130 --> 08:40.970
and take out a second mortgage
on the house to make her bail,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.310
but yes, I'm relieved
to finally have her back home.

08:48.280 --> 08:53.050
Thing is, she's not the same kid
she was when she left.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.620
How could she be?

08:55.650 --> 08:57.790
Come in.

08:58.990 --> 08:59.960
Honey, what are you doing?

08:59.990 --> 09:01.990
You love those posters.

09:02.030 --> 09:04.060
And your animals?

09:04.090 --> 09:07.000
If I have to stay here, can't
I make it look the way I want?

09:07.030 --> 09:08.800
Of course.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.100
You remember Dr. Bull.

09:12.140 --> 09:14.940
Mm-hmm.

09:15.970 --> 09:17.970
Why don't you give us a minute?

09:23.650 --> 09:25.880
So what is it?

09:25.920 --> 09:28.050
She won't let you smoke
in the house?

09:29.250 --> 09:30.920
Well,

09:30.950 --> 09:33.920
can't be about not letting
your boyfriend visit your room.

09:33.960 --> 09:35.960
He's still in prison.

09:35.990 --> 09:37.990
Is it the hair?

09:38.030 --> 09:40.730
Your mom got issues
with the hair?

09:42.070 --> 09:44.330
I'm just trying to figure out

09:44.370 --> 09:47.040
why you have
all this anger towards her.

09:47.070 --> 09:49.170
All she did was...

09:49.210 --> 09:51.010
put together as much money
as she could

09:51.040 --> 09:53.110
so you wouldn't have
to sleep in a cell.

09:55.710 --> 09:57.250
What do you want?

09:57.280 --> 10:00.080
I feel a sense
of professional obligation.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.990
I want you to understand
how much trouble you're in.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.790
You committed armed robbery.

10:04.820 --> 10:06.390
You held up a jewelry store.

10:06.420 --> 10:08.420
You're looking at 25 years
in prison.

10:08.460 --> 10:11.700
Stop me if I say anything
that makes you give a damn.

10:11.730 --> 10:12.960
What are you doing
in my bedroom?

10:13.000 --> 10:13.760
You're not my lawyer.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.360
No. I'm the guy
your lawyer called

10:15.400 --> 10:17.700
when she realized just
how difficult it was gonna be

10:17.730 --> 10:20.300
to dig you out of the hole
you dug for yourself.

10:20.340 --> 10:21.770
Where'd you get the gun?

10:21.810 --> 10:23.410
I bought it.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.240
Obviously, you didn't tell them
who you were.

10:25.270 --> 10:28.410
The whole country's been looking
for you for the last 18 months.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.080
I bought a fake I.D. online.

10:30.110 --> 10:31.280
With what, credit card?

10:31.310 --> 10:32.980
Bitcoins.

10:33.020 --> 10:35.350
Oh, yes, because he let
you use the computer

10:35.380 --> 10:38.320
and watch TV and read the paper.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.760
Who's the president?

10:43.330 --> 10:45.360
Get out of my room.

10:45.390 --> 10:48.360
Sorry, that was a tough one.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.670
Which Kardashian is pregnant?

10:53.440 --> 10:56.310
So, how'd it work
when you were hungry?

10:56.340 --> 10:58.910
Did you have a special
word you'd use?

11:00.740 --> 11:02.350
What about when
you wanted water,

11:02.380 --> 11:05.280
or to go to the bathroom?

11:05.310 --> 11:07.220
How about when he
wanted something?

11:07.250 --> 11:10.290
Did he have a special
pet name he'd call you,

11:10.320 --> 11:13.920
or did he just come
and take what he wanted?

11:13.960 --> 11:16.330
I've been doing this
a long time,

11:16.360 --> 11:17.960
and I know how it works.

11:17.990 --> 11:19.960
He convinces you
you can't live without him,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.400
and you can't, because he's
got you under lock and key.

11:22.430 --> 11:25.300
So you do the only thing you
can do to make sense of it,

11:25.330 --> 11:29.070
the only thing you
can do to survive.

11:29.110 --> 11:32.310
You develop feelings for him.

11:32.340 --> 11:33.880
But he's gone now, Jemma,

11:33.910 --> 11:37.310
and the only one who
can save you is you.

11:37.350 --> 11:40.280
You're not being
disloyal or unfaithful

11:40.320 --> 11:42.150
by telling the truth
about what happened.

11:44.520 --> 11:48.360
It only feels like love
'cause you didn't know

11:48.390 --> 11:51.260
what other box to put it in.

11:56.170 --> 11:58.300
When you're ready to
fight for your life,

11:58.330 --> 12:01.170
give me a call.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.970
But don't wait too long.

12:03.010 --> 12:05.470
Justice is impatient.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.390
Jemma Whitbeck grew up
on Long Island,

12:20.420 --> 12:23.160
an only child,
raised by her mom, Maya.

12:23.190 --> 12:25.490
Mom and dad never married,
and dad was out of the picture

12:25.530 --> 12:28.530
before Jemma's third birthday.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.500
She was a solid student.

12:31.530 --> 12:34.440
No hint that this kind of thing
was in her future.

12:34.470 --> 12:36.370
What about friends? She's alone
in all these pictures.

12:36.410 --> 12:38.140
Does she have any friends?

12:38.170 --> 12:39.280
Mostly on the Web.

12:39.310 --> 12:41.580
Got it. I can relate.

12:41.610 --> 12:44.380
Wait, she was in high school and
she didn't have any friends?
No.

12:44.410 --> 12:46.350
She did... a best friend.

12:46.380 --> 12:47.880
Cassie Walters.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.290
According to her mother,
they were inseparable.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.150
And then,
halfway through tenth grade,

12:51.190 --> 12:53.190
they had some kind
of a falling-out.

12:53.220 --> 12:56.260
And then, a few months later,
Jemma disappeared.

12:56.290 --> 12:58.290
So, what's the plan?

12:58.330 --> 13:00.300
Bull is convinced that
Jemma is a victim.

13:00.330 --> 13:01.830
He believes that
she was coerced,

13:01.870 --> 13:04.500
- and he wants to argue duress.
- Duress?

13:04.530 --> 13:08.140
Well, that's...
That's not gonna be easy.

13:08.170 --> 13:10.570
Duress is an
affirmative defense,

13:10.610 --> 13:13.840
which means that once
the prosecutor proves

13:13.880 --> 13:15.510
that she was guilty
of armed robbery,

13:15.540 --> 13:18.110
we have to prove that
she was in fear for her life...

13:18.150 --> 13:20.020
that the only reason
that she committed this crime

13:20.050 --> 13:22.550
was because she was convinced
that this guy Ryan

13:22.590 --> 13:24.250
was gonna kill her
if she didn't.

13:24.290 --> 13:27.060
Well, then, I guess that's
what we have to do.

13:28.460 --> 13:30.360
People who are able to
adapt to difficult situations

13:30.390 --> 13:31.900
will understand Jemma's plight.

13:31.930 --> 13:34.000
They will see that
what Jemma did was adapt

13:34.030 --> 13:35.530
to her circumstances.

13:35.560 --> 13:37.230
She did what she had to do
in order to survive,

13:37.270 --> 13:40.100
including...
rob a store at gunpoint.

13:40.140 --> 13:42.410
So, what kind of characteristics
are we looking for?

13:42.440 --> 13:45.410
We'll start with extroverts.
Thrill seekers.

13:45.440 --> 13:48.210
Who here likes amusement parks?

13:48.240 --> 13:50.250
What's your favorite part?
The rides?

13:50.280 --> 13:53.420
The roller coasters.
Anything that goes fast.

13:53.450 --> 13:55.520
Mm.

13:55.550 --> 13:57.450
We find this juror
to be acceptable.

13:57.490 --> 13:59.890
- How about you?
- The games.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.590
Ring toss, Skee-Ball.

14:01.620 --> 14:04.030
And the food.
I like the food.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.490
Me, too.

14:06.630 --> 14:08.400
We'd like to thank
and excuse this juror.

14:08.430 --> 14:09.400
How about you?

14:09.430 --> 14:10.470
Does Disney count?

14:10.500 --> 14:12.940
Are you kidding?
We love Disney.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.440
We'd like to thank
and excuse this juror.

14:16.470 --> 14:18.340
But not just thrill seekers.

14:18.370 --> 14:19.940
Agreeable thrill seekers.

14:19.980 --> 14:21.510
You are in a bar,

14:21.540 --> 14:22.550
minding your own business,

14:22.580 --> 14:24.480
and someone comes up to you
and insults you...

14:24.510 --> 14:26.950
what do you do?
Me?

14:26.980 --> 14:28.580
I look the other way.

14:28.620 --> 14:31.490
Sticks and stones
will break my bones...

14:31.520 --> 14:34.160
We find this juror
to be acceptable.

14:34.190 --> 14:36.490
People who are emotionally
stable. No neurotics.

14:36.530 --> 14:39.230
You are gonna ask your boss
for a raise.

14:39.260 --> 14:40.330
How do you prepare?

14:40.360 --> 14:41.530
Just go in and ask.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.170
We find this juror
to be acceptable.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.980
Hey, what are you doing here?

15:01.020 --> 15:02.390
It's past 7:00.

15:02.420 --> 15:04.520
Finishing my report
on Jemma's online life.

15:04.550 --> 15:07.590
Oh, is this the website
where she met Ryan?

15:07.620 --> 15:08.990
Yeah.

15:09.030 --> 15:12.030
This guy was patient.

15:12.060 --> 15:13.360
He took his time,

15:13.400 --> 15:15.160
got her to open up
about herself,

15:15.200 --> 15:16.570
share intimate thoughts.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.600
Not your first time
at this rodeo, huh?

15:19.640 --> 15:21.740
Well...

15:21.770 --> 15:24.740
I never ran away
with a stranger,

15:24.770 --> 15:27.210
and I certainly never
robbed anyone at gunpoint,

15:27.240 --> 15:29.610
but when I was 16, sure,

15:29.650 --> 15:31.980
I trusted some people
I shouldn't have.

15:32.020 --> 15:35.650
I fell in love with
some guys I never met,

15:35.680 --> 15:39.660
and I had my heart broken
by some men I now realize

15:39.690 --> 15:43.130
were probably
three times my age.

15:43.160 --> 15:44.660
What did we do
before the Internet?

15:46.730 --> 15:49.570
Oh, hold on one second.

15:49.600 --> 15:53.240
Ah, it's Bull.
Excuse me.

15:53.270 --> 15:55.140
Hey, what's up, boss?

15:56.710 --> 16:00.310
Oh...

16:00.340 --> 16:03.050
All right, I'll hop a cab,
I'll be right there.

16:06.550 --> 16:09.550
: She actually
tried to visit him in prison.

16:09.590 --> 16:11.520
Got the call two hours ago.

16:11.550 --> 16:12.720
What's most concerning to me is

16:12.760 --> 16:15.520
she has no idea
how damning this is.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.590
That, all by itself,
could completely sink

16:17.630 --> 16:19.430
any chance she has
for acquittal.

16:19.460 --> 16:20.760
I had to go to work.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.570
She promised to stay home.
That was our agreement.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.470
If we can't get this girl
under control,

16:25.500 --> 16:27.100
not only are you gonna
lose your daughter,

16:27.140 --> 16:28.440
you're gonna lose your house.

16:28.470 --> 16:31.370
I-I don't know what to do.

16:31.410 --> 16:33.510
I do.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.550
You told them to revoke my bail?

16:36.580 --> 16:37.750
You're sending me to jail?

16:37.780 --> 16:39.620
What kind of mother are you?

16:39.650 --> 16:40.780
I love you, Jemma.
Maya...

16:40.820 --> 16:42.450
Get your hands off me!

16:42.490 --> 16:44.450
It's for her own good.

16:44.490 --> 16:46.760
Get off of me!

16:46.790 --> 16:48.320
You're doing the right thing.

16:48.360 --> 16:51.490
It's only for the duration
of the trial. Okay?

16:51.530 --> 16:54.630
She will be released as soon
as the jury acquits her.

16:56.500 --> 16:57.670
It's okay.

17:06.839 --> 17:08.810
I feel like the bandleader
on the Titanic.

17:08.839 --> 17:10.550
Our client's totally disengaged.

17:10.579 --> 17:12.520
It's like she's watching
someone else's trial.

17:12.550 --> 17:13.750
You need to keep your eye

17:13.780 --> 17:14.750
on juror ten.

17:14.780 --> 17:16.619
How did we end up
with a neurotic introvert

17:16.650 --> 17:17.819
who works for the post office?

17:17.849 --> 17:19.589
He's the opposite of adaptive.

17:19.619 --> 17:21.619
We were out of challenges.

17:21.660 --> 17:23.530
And it was either him
or the lady

17:23.560 --> 17:26.760
whose idea of a thrill
is playing Skee-Ball.

17:47.350 --> 17:50.150
I'd, uh, like to clean
their stuff out of here,

17:50.190 --> 17:53.420
but they told me I couldn't
until the trial was over.

17:53.460 --> 17:55.290
You don't know when
that's gonna be, do you?

17:55.320 --> 17:56.730
No, sir, we're not
with the cops.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.300
You have to check with them.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.600
How long did they live here?

18:02.630 --> 18:04.600
About a year and a half.

18:04.630 --> 18:06.670
They were late on their rent
just about every month.

18:06.700 --> 18:08.170
Did you ever see the girl?

18:08.200 --> 18:10.410
Did you ever see Jemma?

18:10.440 --> 18:12.180
Once, that I can remember.

18:12.210 --> 18:13.680
A couple weeks
before the robbery.

18:13.710 --> 18:15.310
I came to get the rent.

18:15.340 --> 18:16.750
Did you ever
get the impression

18:16.780 --> 18:17.750
something was wrong?

18:17.780 --> 18:19.550
How do you mean?

18:19.580 --> 18:20.850
Well, did she look scared?

18:20.880 --> 18:23.450
Did she try and signal you?
No.

18:23.490 --> 18:24.550
A 35-year-old man

18:24.590 --> 18:26.220
with a 16

18:26.260 --> 18:27.420
That didn't raise any red flags?

18:27.460 --> 18:29.830
I only saw her
for a split second.

18:29.860 --> 18:32.260
Could've been his daughter
or his niece.

18:32.300 --> 18:34.460
She had green hair.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.830
I didn't know it was the girl
everyone was looking for.

18:36.870 --> 18:39.470
If I did, I would have
called the police.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.400
What do we have in here?

18:46.280 --> 18:48.410
Think I found the guest room.

18:51.780 --> 18:52.780
Oh...

18:56.790 --> 18:59.220
Did the defendant,
Jemma Whitbeck,

18:59.260 --> 19:00.890
enter the store with anyone?

19:00.920 --> 19:02.360
No, she came in alone.

19:02.390 --> 19:04.430
I was helping another customer
at the counter.

19:04.460 --> 19:06.760
- So she had to wait.
- Yes.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.360
She was there for at least
half an hour.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.870
Objection.
No foundation.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.870
Overruled.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.770
Did she ever ask to use a phone?

19:13.800 --> 19:14.770
No.

19:14.800 --> 19:15.970
Did she say she needed help?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.970
Objection.
Calls for hearsay.

19:18.010 --> 19:19.980
Overruled, Counselor.

19:20.010 --> 19:22.280
Did the defendant

19:22.310 --> 19:23.880
ever try to slip you a note

19:23.910 --> 19:26.220
or ask if there was another
way out of the store?

19:26.250 --> 19:27.450
A back door?

19:27.480 --> 19:29.720
Okay, we get it.
She didn't try to escape.

19:29.750 --> 19:33.320
Sit down, Ms. Macera.

19:33.360 --> 19:34.890
Would you stop it?

19:34.920 --> 19:37.260
You are pissing everyone off.

19:37.290 --> 19:38.960
It's a sea of red, Bull.

19:38.990 --> 19:41.260
Not a speck of green anywhere.

19:41.300 --> 19:44.270
Okay, I give up.
I'm going to plan B.

19:44.300 --> 19:47.340
Let's find the ADA,
see if we can cut a deal.

19:47.370 --> 19:50.510
Well, come on, the ADA
has no incentive

19:50.540 --> 19:51.570
to cut a deal.

19:51.610 --> 19:52.910
Set up a meeting.

19:52.940 --> 19:54.540
Let's see if we can
negotiate a plea.

19:54.580 --> 19:56.650
Maybe we can get
the 25 years down to ten.

19:56.680 --> 19:59.920
Ms. Macera, let me
take the lead on this.

19:59.950 --> 20:02.820
I have a relationship
with the DA's office.

20:02.850 --> 20:05.290
Thank you.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.520
Haven't done anything yet.

20:07.560 --> 20:11.760
You don't honestly think
I'm gonna dismiss the charges?

20:11.790 --> 20:13.330
No, but we were hoping
you might discuss a plea.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.360
Why would I do that?

20:14.400 --> 20:16.430
Softballs like this don't
come across my desk

20:16.470 --> 20:17.870
all that often.

20:17.900 --> 20:19.740
Be that as it may,
you don't want to send

20:19.770 --> 20:21.000
an innocent woman to prison.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.340
You're right, I don't.

20:22.370 --> 20:24.410
But you haven't
shown me anything

20:24.440 --> 20:25.510
pointing to innocence.

20:25.540 --> 20:27.010
She was coerced.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.980
She was in fear for her life.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.410
Not according to your client.

20:30.450 --> 20:33.950
You two should talk,
get your stories straight.

20:33.980 --> 20:37.350
Look, all I'm asking for
is some proof.

20:37.390 --> 20:39.620
A scar, a threatening e-mail,

20:39.660 --> 20:40.660
a cry for help.

20:40.690 --> 20:43.730
Something to back up
your claim.
We have proof.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.930
We have an expert.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.560
Dr. Stephanie Messner.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.400
Who?

20:49.430 --> 20:51.000
She's a shrink's shrink.

20:51.030 --> 20:53.940
A world-renowned expert
in the field of victimization.

20:53.970 --> 20:56.840
And she will explain that Jemma
was not a willing participant

20:56.870 --> 20:58.010
in the robbery.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.310
I'll take my chances
with the jury.

21:01.340 --> 21:03.880
I've seen this doctor
testify before.

21:03.910 --> 21:04.980
She's good.

21:05.010 --> 21:08.580
She'll prove you wrong,
and she'll sink both cases.

21:08.620 --> 21:10.490
Jemma will be acquitted,
and so will Ryan.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.320
Ryan? That's a stretch.

21:13.360 --> 21:17.060
Well, credibility is
a prosecutor's currency,

21:17.090 --> 21:18.790
and once the jury sees

21:18.830 --> 21:20.360
that you were wrong about Jemma,

21:20.400 --> 21:21.800
they are gonna question
your case against Ryan.

21:21.830 --> 21:24.370
And before you know it...

21:24.400 --> 21:26.340
reasonable doubt.
Look,

21:26.370 --> 21:29.710
we're not asking you
to dismiss the charges. Okay?

21:29.740 --> 21:32.510
Just show some humanity.
She's a kid.

21:35.640 --> 21:39.420
Will she testify against Ryan?

21:39.450 --> 21:40.980
I'm not doing that.
I won't do that.

21:41.020 --> 21:43.350
Jemma, honey,
listen to Dr. Bull.

21:43.390 --> 21:44.820
Let me make this simple for you.

21:44.850 --> 21:46.660
If you don't testify
against him,

21:46.690 --> 21:48.920
he's probably gonna
testify against you.

21:48.960 --> 21:51.730
That would never happen.
Why not?

21:51.760 --> 21:54.030
He doesn't want to spend
25 years in prison

21:54.060 --> 21:55.360
any more than you do.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.130
You don't understand.

21:56.160 --> 21:59.740
No, you don't understand.

21:59.770 --> 22:02.470
He doesn't love you.

22:02.510 --> 22:04.470
He never did.

22:04.510 --> 22:05.710
Everything he wanted you for,

22:05.740 --> 22:07.740
everything he wanted to do,
he's done.

22:07.780 --> 22:10.880
And if he wants to use you
as a bargaining chip, he will.

22:16.020 --> 22:17.750
I want to go back
to my cell now.

22:17.790 --> 22:18.990
Not yet!

22:22.730 --> 22:24.860
You need to tell that jury

22:24.890 --> 22:29.500
all of the awful things that
he did to you. Everything.

22:29.530 --> 22:31.430
And only then

22:31.470 --> 22:34.070
is there a chance that
we can make this go away.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.900
But if you let him
get the upper hand,

22:35.940 --> 22:39.480
he will continue to do what
he has been doing to you.

22:39.510 --> 22:41.480
Only instead of treating
you like an animal,

22:41.510 --> 22:44.180
he is gonna get you to
serve his prison time!

22:44.210 --> 22:46.080
This meeting's over.

22:46.110 --> 22:47.980
He's gonna trade you to the ADA

22:48.020 --> 22:49.750
like the thing
he thinks you are.

22:51.650 --> 22:54.560
Why would you let him
destroy your life twice?

22:54.590 --> 22:57.630
If you're afraid, we will
get you protection!

22:57.660 --> 22:59.530
Jemma, trust me!

23:02.000 --> 23:03.970
Call your
next witness, Mr. PAPPAS.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.970
The People call
Ryan Mitchell to the stand.

23:11.540 --> 23:14.840
Ob-Objection. Uh, we haven't
been given proper notice.

23:14.880 --> 23:15.810
Counselor knows good and well

23:15.840 --> 23:17.750
the defendant doesn't
have to give notice

23:17.780 --> 23:20.520
of his intention to testify.

23:20.550 --> 23:23.490
Could, uh, all of
the many legal teams

23:23.520 --> 23:25.490
come up to the bench
for a sidebar.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.500
You made a deal, didn't you?

23:40.570 --> 23:41.670
Someone want to tell me

23:41.700 --> 23:43.870
what's going on?

23:43.910 --> 23:45.640
Dr. Bull and Mr. Colón
came to me last night,

23:45.670 --> 23:46.740
asking for a deal.

23:46.780 --> 23:49.510
I made them an offer, which
they did not respond to.

23:49.550 --> 23:52.080
So, this morning, I made
the same offer to Mr. Mitchell.

23:52.110 --> 23:54.220
And my client accepted.

23:54.250 --> 23:57.490
So the kidnapper is going to
testify against his victim?

23:57.520 --> 24:00.160
You two were very
persuasive last night.

24:00.190 --> 24:03.560
I mean, you have this important
expert witness coming

24:03.590 --> 24:06.500
who threatens to damage
my credibility with the jury.

24:06.530 --> 24:09.030
I needed to be sure I could
still secure convictions

24:09.060 --> 24:10.570
against both parties,

24:10.600 --> 24:13.040
like you said.

24:13.070 --> 24:14.170
What did you offer him?

24:14.200 --> 24:15.770
Five years off the maximum.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.610
So, he's getting less time
than his victim.

24:17.640 --> 24:21.740
She's his co-defendant,
not his victim.

24:21.780 --> 24:24.610
Mr. Mitchell, step up
to the witness stand.

24:24.650 --> 24:26.110
The clerk will swear you in.

24:28.580 --> 24:30.790
Did you kidnap your co

24:30.820 --> 24:32.190
Of course not.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.290
Uh, she came with me willingly.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.190
I've never had
to force her to do anything.

24:36.220 --> 24:37.530
Objection.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.630
She was under
the age of consent.

24:39.660 --> 24:41.860
She's an adult now
and she's not pressing charges.

24:41.900 --> 24:43.300
Well, then I'll press charges.

24:43.330 --> 24:44.700
Her mother will press charges.

24:44.730 --> 24:47.570
You can't,
not without cooperation

24:47.600 --> 24:49.270
from your client.

24:49.300 --> 24:51.110
Counsel, enough.

24:51.140 --> 24:52.140
Ask him a question.

24:52.170 --> 24:55.210
Sir, whose idea was the robbery?

24:55.240 --> 24:58.080
It was Ms. Whitbeck's.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.550
Hmm.

25:00.580 --> 25:02.620
Not to add insult to injury,

25:02.650 --> 25:06.220
the mirror jurors find Ryan
credible and compelling.

25:06.250 --> 25:08.320
Well, they're idiots.
He's lying.

25:08.360 --> 25:10.590
She knew that
we were low on cash.

25:10.630 --> 25:13.960
And she told me about
an idea that she had.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.830
I laughed when she first
put it out there,

25:15.860 --> 25:17.330
but she wouldn't give it up.

25:17.370 --> 25:18.770
And, um...

25:18.800 --> 25:20.900
I told her that I just
can't handle a gun.

25:20.940 --> 25:23.670
I can't carry
a gun. It's...

25:23.710 --> 25:26.040
I just can't.

25:26.070 --> 25:28.610
You know, there are certain
lines that you just don't cross,

25:28.640 --> 25:32.010
and, um... but she said that
that wouldn't be a problem.

25:32.050 --> 25:34.620
Eventually, I-I said sure.

25:34.650 --> 25:37.690
This guy has no lines.
He has no limits.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.120
Listen to him. He's shameless.

25:39.150 --> 25:40.360
I'm gonna
change the subject.

25:40.390 --> 25:43.160
Some people would
have us believe

25:43.190 --> 25:46.130
that you had your co-defendant
under lock and key.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.660
Did you?

25:47.700 --> 25:49.030
Of course not.

25:49.060 --> 25:50.800
We were in love.

25:50.830 --> 25:51.870
We lived together,

25:51.900 --> 25:54.270
but everybody could
come and go as they wished.

25:54.300 --> 25:56.770
But to the best
of your knowledge,

25:56.810 --> 25:58.610
she never actually did leave.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.840
Well, she did.
Once, she left for a whole day.

26:01.880 --> 26:04.180
Did she tell you where she went?

26:04.210 --> 26:06.850
When she got
back, I asked her.

26:06.880 --> 26:08.850
Objection. Hearsay.

26:08.880 --> 26:11.650
I'll allow it.

26:11.690 --> 26:12.820
What did she say?

26:12.860 --> 26:16.320
She said that she went back home

26:16.360 --> 26:17.690
to Farmingdale.

26:17.730 --> 26:18.830
So you're testifying

26:18.860 --> 26:21.700
that she told you she left
the house of her own free will

26:21.730 --> 26:24.670
and returned
to her mother's house.

26:24.700 --> 26:27.170
Did she have dinner?
Did she stay overnight?

26:27.200 --> 26:29.340
No, she was back
before dinnertime.

26:29.370 --> 26:31.710
She told me that she was
standing across the street

26:31.740 --> 26:34.710
from the house with a
baseball cap and sunglasses on,

26:34.740 --> 26:36.880
and she could see her mother
through the windows,

26:36.910 --> 26:38.950
but just couldn't bring
herself to knock on the door.

26:38.980 --> 26:42.180
And she just wanted
to come back... to me.

26:42.220 --> 26:44.220
And that's what she did?

26:44.250 --> 26:46.690
That's what she did.

26:48.860 --> 26:50.360
Prosecution has nothing further.

26:58.430 --> 27:00.400
That ADA double-crossed us.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.940
We went to him in good faith
to cut a deal,

27:02.970 --> 27:06.410
and he turned it around
and used it against us.

27:06.440 --> 27:07.410
Come on.

27:07.440 --> 27:10.680
It wasn't exactly in good faith.

27:10.710 --> 27:14.050
You knew I was bluffing,
and for all I know, so did he.

27:14.080 --> 27:17.690
Still, using a man who abducted
a minor to convict her,

27:17.720 --> 27:18.690
that's a first.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.990
You know what else I think
might be a first?

27:21.020 --> 27:23.760
Every one of our
mirror jurors is red.

27:23.790 --> 27:26.760
The whole jury,
not an inkling of green.

27:26.800 --> 27:29.930
You don't have a lot
to say, boss.

27:29.970 --> 27:32.770
I was just thinking
about the upside.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.270
The upside?

27:34.300 --> 27:35.900
: Wow.

27:35.940 --> 27:36.940
Marissa, cut him off.

27:36.970 --> 27:39.010
Oh, no.

27:39.040 --> 27:42.180
Ryan's no longer part of
the case. He's been dealt with.

27:42.210 --> 27:43.880
He won't be in
the courtroom anymore,

27:43.910 --> 27:46.350
which is what I wanted
in the first place,

27:46.380 --> 27:49.890
for Jemma to have
her own day in court.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.150
What, should we be lining up
any new witnesses?

27:52.190 --> 27:54.090
Like who?

27:54.120 --> 27:56.260
There are no witnesses.
That's part of the problem.

27:56.290 --> 27:57.790
Well, what about the pictures
that Danny and Chunk

27:57.830 --> 27:59.830
took at the shack?
They're really compelling.

27:59.860 --> 28:01.900
Oh, they're nothing.

28:01.930 --> 28:05.970
Picture of a pillow and a bucket
in a tiny closet?

28:06.000 --> 28:07.270
Doesn't mean a thing

28:07.300 --> 28:09.070
unless Jemma gets
on the stand and says,

28:09.100 --> 28:11.970
"That's where I slept.
That bucket was my bathroom."

28:12.010 --> 28:13.140
Any chance

28:13.180 --> 28:14.740
she changed her mind?

28:16.950 --> 28:19.450
I think we're getting close.

28:19.480 --> 28:22.180
But...

28:22.220 --> 28:25.790
she's so mired in shame.

28:25.820 --> 28:27.960
Even when Ryan was talking about

28:27.990 --> 28:31.260
how she couldn't
bring herself to go home.

28:31.290 --> 28:32.900
I was watching her.
You could see it.

28:32.930 --> 28:35.260
She... she had a story to tell,

28:35.300 --> 28:37.270
but she was so ashamed
of that story,

28:37.300 --> 28:41.800
so ashamed of what she did,
of what he did to her.

28:41.840 --> 28:45.140
And I'm sure she
feels completely alone.

28:45.170 --> 28:48.310
And when she walks
into that courtroom,

28:48.340 --> 28:52.450
and there's nobody there,
just her mom and us.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.980
Remember
all those people

28:54.020 --> 28:55.980
who were searching for her?

28:56.020 --> 28:58.820
Friends, neighbors?
Where are they now?

29:01.120 --> 29:04.960
Benny, that's an
excellent question.

29:04.990 --> 29:08.900
Jemma and I always talked
about coming to this school,

29:08.930 --> 29:10.830
being roommates freshman year.

29:10.870 --> 29:12.530
Best friend talk.
I can relate.

29:12.570 --> 29:16.040
We met in first grade.
Did everything together.

29:16.070 --> 29:19.470
Girl Scouts, Model U.N.,
robotics camp.

29:19.510 --> 29:20.940
What happened?

29:20.980 --> 29:23.880
I mean, when she disappeared,

29:23.910 --> 29:25.550
you guys hadn't been
speaking for a while.

29:25.580 --> 29:28.250
I don't know.

29:28.280 --> 29:30.550
Yeah, she... got weird.

29:30.590 --> 29:33.890
What do you mean, weird?
She was moody.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.320
Never wanted to do anything.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.490
She just, like, stayed
in her room alone.

29:37.530 --> 29:41.160
She might have been mad at me.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.930
It was right around the time
I joined the debate team.

29:43.970 --> 29:46.070
And then I
got a boyfriend and...

29:46.100 --> 29:47.200
I guess she felt left out.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.240
Do you miss her?

29:48.270 --> 29:49.970
Of course.

29:50.010 --> 29:52.910
Would you be willing
to do something for her?

29:55.080 --> 29:56.850
When Jemma went missing,

29:56.880 --> 30:00.250
you were the people
who searched the woods.

30:00.280 --> 30:03.520
You put up posters, you marched
in candlelight vigils.

30:03.550 --> 30:07.920
Well, I'm here to ask you
to be there for Jemma again.

30:07.960 --> 30:10.490
Thank you for welcoming me
to your church.

30:10.530 --> 30:11.960
To Maya Whitbeck's church.

30:11.990 --> 30:14.900
To Jemma Whitbeck's church.

30:14.930 --> 30:16.530
Now, I know that when Jemma
first disappeared,

30:16.560 --> 30:20.070
it was you,
it was this congregation,

30:20.100 --> 30:22.970
that organized
the search parties

30:23.010 --> 30:24.370
and that sent her your prayers.

30:24.410 --> 30:27.510
Well, Jemma needs you again.

30:27.540 --> 30:30.410
I know you've all heard
a lot of terrible things

30:30.450 --> 30:32.610
since Jemma first vanished
18 months ago.

30:32.650 --> 30:36.920
But just because you hear
something doesn't make it true.

30:36.950 --> 30:40.660
And we can't fairly judge anyone

30:40.690 --> 30:42.560
if we don't have the full story.

30:42.590 --> 30:45.290
The prosecution is done
with his case.

30:45.330 --> 30:49.300
And now, it's our turn
to present a defense.

30:49.330 --> 30:50.970
I'm gonna be honest with you.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.970
Jemma, I'm having
a really hard time

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
figuring out what
that defense could be.

30:55.040 --> 30:58.040
Doesn't matter.

30:58.070 --> 31:01.940
The jury, they need
to know how he treated you.

31:01.980 --> 31:04.080
How he coerced you.

31:04.110 --> 31:06.950
It's... it's the only
way we can win.

31:08.580 --> 31:10.420
It's okay, let's just
be done with it.

31:10.450 --> 31:13.590
I'm... I'm ready
to serve my time.

31:13.620 --> 31:15.690
There's a part of me that's
looking forward to it.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.530
I believe you believe that.

31:18.560 --> 31:20.030
But it's just not true.

31:20.060 --> 31:22.430
Come on.

31:22.460 --> 31:24.270
Let's go to court.

31:24.300 --> 31:27.070
You ever heard of
"learned helplessness"?

31:27.100 --> 31:30.410
It's when people feel they have
no control over their lives.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.410
They see no future.

31:32.440 --> 31:35.010
They resign themselves
to just getting through the day,

31:35.040 --> 31:36.950
to surviving.

31:36.980 --> 31:38.010
Sound familiar?

31:40.750 --> 31:43.050
So many people
care about you, Jemma.

31:43.090 --> 31:47.060
So many people understand the
awfulness you've been through.

31:47.090 --> 31:48.320
They may not know
the particulars,

31:48.360 --> 31:50.190
but they know how dark
it must have been.

31:50.230 --> 31:54.500
They can't wait
to see you again.

31:54.530 --> 31:57.070
Show you the light.

31:57.100 --> 31:58.700
No, you're wrong.

31:58.730 --> 32:00.700
No one cares.

32:00.740 --> 32:04.070
Maybe just my mom, but...

32:04.110 --> 32:06.540
the truth is, she'll be
better off without me.

32:19.050 --> 32:20.590
Hey, Jemma.

32:20.620 --> 32:23.730
Everyone at school says hi.

32:23.760 --> 32:26.560
We're glad
you're back.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.070
Love you, Jemma.

32:30.100 --> 32:31.700
So good
to see you.

32:35.070 --> 32:36.570
Cassie?

32:36.600 --> 32:39.010
I missed you so much.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.710
I'm sorry I wasn't
there for you.

32:40.740 --> 32:42.380
You must have felt so alone.

32:42.410 --> 32:45.210
God, it's so good to see you.

32:45.250 --> 32:48.250
It's so good to see everybody.

32:52.620 --> 32:54.590
So what do you say?

32:54.620 --> 32:57.060
Tired of just surviving?

32:57.090 --> 32:58.760
Ready to put up a fight?

32:59.790 --> 33:02.000
I think I am.

33:04.370 --> 33:07.100
I think I'm ready to testify.

33:12.810 --> 33:15.440
When I started chatting
with Ryan online, I was only 16.

33:15.480 --> 33:18.310
He said he was 18,
and he seemed really nice.

33:18.350 --> 33:21.620
Were you surprised by his age
when you met him in person?

33:21.650 --> 33:23.290
Yeah.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.790
So why did you go with him?

33:28.220 --> 33:32.160
I-I know this sounds stupid,
but I felt like I knew him.

33:32.190 --> 33:33.600
We'd been talking for months.

33:33.630 --> 33:35.760
I trusted him,
which I know sounds ridiculous.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.600
So I-I said I'd...
I'd go have dinner with him.

33:38.630 --> 33:40.470
Just dinner, that's it.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.280
W-We had dinner,

33:48.310 --> 33:51.150
and then, he said
he was going to drive me home.

33:51.180 --> 33:52.580
We stopped at one point

33:52.610 --> 33:54.820
'cause he said he had wanted
to show me the stars.

33:54.850 --> 33:56.220
It was the middle of nowhere.

33:56.250 --> 33:57.850
We got out of the car to look,

33:57.890 --> 33:59.350
and that's-that's
when he told me

33:59.390 --> 34:01.160
h-he wanted to have sex with me.

34:01.190 --> 34:03.860
I was... I was really,

34:03.890 --> 34:05.330
I mean, I was shocked, and...

34:06.560 --> 34:09.199
I told him I'd never
done that before.

34:09.230 --> 34:11.300
I was shaking,
and really scared.

34:11.330 --> 34:13.300
And at first,
he seemed okay with it,

34:13.340 --> 34:15.770
so I... so I calmed down for,
like, a second.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.340
And then...

34:17.370 --> 34:19.270
and then, that's when
he pushed me to the ground,

34:19.310 --> 34:21.280
and did what he wanted.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.350
Did you cry?

34:24.380 --> 34:26.350
Yeah.

34:26.380 --> 34:27.520
Did you scream?

34:27.550 --> 34:29.280
Yeah.

34:29.320 --> 34:31.320
But no one heard?

34:33.719 --> 34:37.530
I finally... fell asleep, or
passed out there on the ground,

34:37.560 --> 34:39.760
and when I woke up,

34:39.790 --> 34:44.900
he, um, had zip-tied
my hands and feet.

34:44.929 --> 34:49.540
Then he... he covered my mouth
with this thick tape.

34:49.570 --> 34:53.679
Carried me into the car and, um,

34:53.710 --> 34:56.210
then he laid me
across the back seat,

34:56.239 --> 34:57.680
and then, it felt like

34:57.710 --> 35:00.250
we drove for hours.

35:03.590 --> 35:06.250
That's... that's
where I lived.

35:06.290 --> 35:09.260
In the closet, mostly.

35:11.290 --> 35:14.660
He threatened me, he beat me,

35:14.700 --> 35:16.830
he...

35:16.860 --> 35:21.340
and he, and he, you know,
he wanted... sex.

35:21.370 --> 35:24.540
All different kinds.

35:25.810 --> 35:28.580
At some point,
did his behavior change?

35:30.810 --> 35:33.450
Well, a few weeks in,
I stopped putting up a fuss.

35:33.480 --> 35:36.350
I just did whatever he wanted,
made him think I liked it.

35:36.380 --> 35:40.190
That seemed to work,
because he... things got better.

35:40.220 --> 35:45.290
He stopped beating me,
and he let me out of the closet.

35:45.330 --> 35:48.460
Jemma, at some point, did you
develop feelings for him?

35:50.430 --> 35:53.400
I know this sounds crazy,
but yeah.

35:53.440 --> 35:55.970
Um, he... he fed me,

35:56.000 --> 36:00.280
he, um, he bought me clothes,
he...

36:00.310 --> 36:05.280
he was scary, but he also, he...
he took care of me.

36:05.310 --> 36:09.220
Or it... or it
felt like it.

36:09.250 --> 36:12.350
He would use the word "love,"
but I know and I realize now,

36:12.390 --> 36:15.860
that for me,
it was just about surviving,

36:15.890 --> 36:17.390
staying alive.

36:17.430 --> 36:20.730
Jemma, was it your idea
to rob the jewelry store?

36:23.470 --> 36:26.370
I've... I've barely ever been
in a jewelry store.

36:26.400 --> 36:29.540
I've never even had
my ears pierced.

36:29.570 --> 36:32.470
He said he'd hurt me
if I didn't do it.

36:32.510 --> 36:36.680
If I didn't buy the gun,
and do what he said.

36:36.710 --> 36:38.510
He said he'd hurt my mom.

36:38.550 --> 36:41.480
He said he'd find her and
do to her what he did to me,

36:41.520 --> 36:43.320
so I just... I just
went along with it.

36:43.350 --> 36:44.950
I didn't know what else to do.

36:44.990 --> 36:48.920
I'm-I'm... I'm sorry
we scared those people,

36:48.960 --> 36:51.030
'cause I know how that feels.

36:51.060 --> 36:54.230
Ryan said, at some point,
you went home.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.470
Like, a month
before the robbery.

36:58.500 --> 37:02.440
He was in the yard, and I, um...

37:02.470 --> 37:04.970
I just, I grabbed the car keys.

37:07.070 --> 37:09.480
I made it all the way home.

37:11.510 --> 37:15.320
But I couldn't...
couldn't go in the house.

37:15.350 --> 37:17.790
Were you afraid
he'd come after you?

37:17.820 --> 37:21.490
Yeah, that was... that was
a big part of it, but...

37:21.520 --> 37:24.690
but it was more than that.

37:27.860 --> 37:31.370
I just felt...

37:31.400 --> 37:33.470
so, like...

37:33.500 --> 37:35.770
I just felt so dirty.

37:35.800 --> 37:39.940
I mean, I-I went with him.

37:39.970 --> 37:43.080
I thought it was my own fault.

37:43.110 --> 37:44.650
And I-I couldn't...

37:44.680 --> 37:48.350
I couldn't face my mom,
I couldn't face anyone.

37:54.590 --> 37:55.890
Talk to me.

37:55.920 --> 38:00.090
I can't explain why,
but we have a juror ten problem.

38:00.130 --> 38:01.730
Ten?

38:01.760 --> 38:04.430
Yep. You don't get to this guy,
and you are staring

38:04.470 --> 38:07.700
at a mistrial, in which case,
Jemma stays in jail,

38:07.740 --> 38:10.070
and we get to do the whole thing
all over again.

38:10.100 --> 38:12.670
You're a real downer,
you know that?

38:12.710 --> 38:14.410
No further questions,
Your Honor.

38:14.440 --> 38:15.910
The defense rests.

38:15.940 --> 38:17.380
Can I just say one more thing?

38:22.950 --> 38:24.450
Go on, Ms. Whitbeck.

38:24.490 --> 38:25.450
I just...

38:26.690 --> 38:28.390
I just want to add that...

38:30.460 --> 38:32.490
...that I love my mom.

38:32.530 --> 38:34.860
And I love my friends.

38:37.060 --> 38:42.000
And I-I love my life, and I-I'd
love a second chance to live it.

38:43.040 --> 38:45.410
There's only one explanation.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.410
That guy's dead.
I'm gonna ask Benny

38:47.440 --> 38:48.940
to go over there
and close his eyes.

38:48.980 --> 38:50.380
Ladies and
gentlemen, let's, uh,

38:50.410 --> 38:52.480
take a 20 minute recess.

38:57.420 --> 38:58.850
Oh, boy. Trashcan basketball.

38:58.890 --> 39:00.390
You're worried
about the verdict.

39:00.420 --> 39:02.590
Well, three days is a long time.

39:02.620 --> 39:03.930
We've waited longer.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.860
I got a bad feeling
about juror number ten.

39:05.890 --> 39:07.860
Oh.

39:07.900 --> 39:09.100
Well, trashcan basketball
worked.

39:09.130 --> 39:10.030
That's the clerk.

39:10.060 --> 39:11.930
The judge wants us
back in the courtroom.

39:13.540 --> 39:14.840
You go ahead.

39:14.870 --> 39:16.500
Uh, I got to make a call.

39:16.540 --> 39:18.510
I will meet you there.

39:18.540 --> 39:21.040
Okay.

39:21.080 --> 39:24.550
Someone get me ADA PAPPAS
on the phone!

39:30.590 --> 39:32.650
This doesn't look good.

39:32.690 --> 39:37.830
Members of the jury, I've been
handed a note that informs me

39:37.860 --> 39:41.560
that you are at
an unbreakable impasse.

39:41.600 --> 39:42.730
Is that true?

39:42.760 --> 39:44.600
Yes, Your Honor.

39:44.630 --> 39:47.600
You're unable to reach
a unanimous verdict?

39:47.640 --> 39:50.970
And you believe that further
deliberation will be futile?

39:51.010 --> 39:52.740
We tried.

39:54.110 --> 39:56.510
It's 11 to one to acquit.

39:56.540 --> 40:00.550
Then I have no choice.

40:00.580 --> 40:02.150
I find this jury to be

40:02.180 --> 40:06.620
hopelessly deadlocked,
and I am declaring a mistrial.

40:06.650 --> 40:09.660
Jurors, thank you for your
time and consideration.

40:09.690 --> 40:10.630
You're excused.

40:11.860 --> 40:12.990
All right.

40:13.030 --> 40:15.600
Let's set a date for a retrial.

40:18.900 --> 40:20.800
N-No, I...

40:20.840 --> 40:23.470
I can't go through this again.

40:26.810 --> 40:27.940
Your Honor...

40:29.680 --> 40:32.910
I got a call this morning
from Dr. Bull.

40:32.950 --> 40:34.920
He reminded me
of something counsel said

40:34.950 --> 40:36.620
at the outset of the case,

40:36.650 --> 40:39.620
that prosecutors
are supposed to protect victims,

40:39.650 --> 40:41.160
not prosecute them.

40:41.190 --> 40:43.990
The jury's verdict
isn't lost on me.

40:44.030 --> 40:45.630
11 to one in favor
of an acquittal.

40:45.660 --> 40:48.200
It's not unanimous,
but it is powerful.

40:48.230 --> 40:50.630
And I listened carefully
to the defendant's testimony,

40:50.670 --> 40:52.000
and I found it credible.

40:52.030 --> 40:53.740
Is there a motion to dismiss

40:53.770 --> 40:55.670
headed my way?
Yes.

40:55.700 --> 40:59.010
Your Honor, the people move
to dismiss all charges

40:59.040 --> 41:01.680
against Ms. Whitbeck.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.580
Dr. Bull also informed me

41:03.610 --> 41:05.510
that Ms. Whitbeck
is willing to testify

41:05.550 --> 41:07.280
against Ryan Mitchell.
With that in mind,

41:07.310 --> 41:08.850
I'll be filing
additional charges

41:08.880 --> 41:10.750
for sexual assault
and kidnapping.

41:10.790 --> 41:12.650
Then, this
court stands adjourned.

41:30.810 --> 41:34.680
If you want to smoke, it's okay.

41:34.710 --> 41:37.550
Not smoking anymore.

41:37.580 --> 41:39.280
I'm trying to put all that away.

41:39.310 --> 41:41.080
All that behind me.

41:41.120 --> 41:43.120
Right.

41:45.190 --> 41:49.060
I am so happy you are here.

41:49.090 --> 41:52.990
I am so happy you're back.

41:53.030 --> 41:54.030
Me, too, Mom.

41:54.060 --> 41:56.860
Can I make you something?
Can I get you something?

41:56.900 --> 41:58.630
Is there anything you want?

41:58.670 --> 42:00.130
No, I just...

42:00.170 --> 42:02.200
I just want to sleep.

42:02.240 --> 42:05.770
I just want to open my eyes
and see that it's morning
