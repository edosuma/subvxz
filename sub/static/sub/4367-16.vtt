00:02.241 --> 00:04.525
You are being watched.

00:04.527 --> 00:06.911
The government
has a secret system--

00:06.913 --> 00:10.998
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:12.879 --> 00:14.921

00:15.714 --> 00:17.639

00:26.683 --> 00:29.734
He's been asking
too many questions.

00:29.736 --> 00:31.185
How do we deal with it?

00:31.187 --> 00:34.054
Seems to me
we have the solution at hand.

00:34.056 --> 00:35.556
Listen,
you've got the wrong guy.

00:35.558 --> 00:38.860
You just need to--

00:46.255 --> 00:49.545
_

00:51.014 --> 00:53.176
_

00:59.431 --> 01:01.849
<i>Danke schon.</i>

01:22.371 --> 01:25.122
_

01:25.124 --> 01:28.659
I'm sorry,
I don't speak German.

01:31.213 --> 01:33.965
_

01:33.967 --> 01:37.301
No, I-I think
it's just a misunderstanding.

01:37.303 --> 01:40.421
_

01:41.974 --> 01:43.808
Are these men bothering you?

01:43.810 --> 01:45.259
I'd be happy to detain them.

01:45.261 --> 01:47.478
Oh, no.
Thank you.

01:47.480 --> 01:50.631
Um, I think
it's just a mistake.

01:50.633 --> 01:52.183
Listen, I'm in a bit
of a hurry.

01:52.995 --> 01:55.914
_

01:57.381 --> 01:59.836
_

02:11.743 --> 02:13.688
_

02:27.119 --> 02:29.261
_

02:31.139 --> 02:32.576
_

02:35.311 --> 02:37.861
Any sign of our guy Bekhti?

02:37.863 --> 02:40.480
No.

02:40.482 --> 02:43.083
And I just had to shoot
our best chance of finding him.

02:47.505 --> 02:49.656
I can't take you anywhere,
Shaw.

02:49.658 --> 02:51.842
Well, he was calling Bekhti.
I got a partial number.

02:51.844 --> 02:53.627
Eight digits.

02:53.629 --> 02:55.679
Couldn't you have shot him
after he finished dialing?

02:55.681 --> 02:57.014
Run it down, all right?

02:57.016 --> 02:58.515
Whatever Bekhti's into,

02:58.517 --> 03:02.770
these guys were willing
to kill a cop to protect it.

03:09.394 --> 03:11.711
Bekhti's cell phone signal
is right below us.

03:11.713 --> 03:16.066
40, maybe 50 feet
above the street.

03:16.068 --> 03:19.653
Probably the top floor.

03:22.941 --> 03:25.192
Here we go!

03:28.062 --> 03:30.414
All right.

03:30.416 --> 03:33.750
Ah, whoa.
Wrong apartment.

03:35.503 --> 03:37.838
Go fish.

03:43.828 --> 03:46.413
All right, we got a winner.

03:46.415 --> 03:47.965
Ahnaz.

03:47.967 --> 03:50.050
You disappoint me.

03:50.052 --> 03:51.768
Look at you, you got semtex.

03:51.770 --> 03:53.753
You have a cell phone
detonator.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.414
Let me see that.

03:56.925 --> 03:58.725
And cesium.

03:58.727 --> 04:01.144
Half a pound.
They're making a dirty bomb.

04:01.146 --> 04:03.480
What's the plan?

04:06.100 --> 04:07.387
_

04:07.733 --> 04:09.574
_

04:12.540 --> 04:15.659
There's no time.
I'm calling Control.

04:15.661 --> 04:17.961
Yeah, this is Catalyst.
Passphrase "Indigo."

04:17.963 --> 04:19.379
Go ahead, Indigo.

04:19.380 --> 04:21.281
Request permission to engage.

04:21.283 --> 04:23.116
Direct action.

04:23.118 --> 04:25.969
Green light.

04:41.502 --> 04:42.986
They still have
the windows closed?

04:42.988 --> 04:44.321
As far as I can tell.

04:44.323 --> 04:45.739
You know the only other people
crazy enough

04:45.741 --> 04:47.524
to use the gas
besides you, Shaw?

04:47.526 --> 04:49.309
Russians.

04:49.311 --> 04:52.812
Crazy FSB Russians.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.831
Where do you think I get it?

05:06.594 --> 05:08.428
We have our first winner.

05:10.516 --> 05:12.799
Number two.

05:17.555 --> 05:20.273
There's three.

05:57.595 --> 06:00.230
I've removed the cesium.

06:34.432 --> 06:37.134
Shaw, what happened?

06:45.778 --> 06:47.694
- Ah!
- Oh!

06:47.696 --> 06:50.147
Aghh!

06:54.035 --> 06:56.486
A little help, Cole.

06:56.488 --> 06:58.271
I can't, uh--

06:58.273 --> 07:00.791
I can't see him.
Just--

07:02.660 --> 07:04.244
What do you have?

07:04.246 --> 07:05.629
Still looking.

07:05.631 --> 07:07.881
I don't see him, Shaw.

07:12.953 --> 07:14.454
I-I still don't have him.

07:14.456 --> 07:15.722
Calm down.

07:15.724 --> 07:18.592
Give me something I can use.

07:21.462 --> 07:25.465
Okay, wait.

07:25.467 --> 07:28.635
Don't move.

07:28.637 --> 07:30.837
Your 3:00...

07:33.242 --> 07:34.241
now.

07:37.912 --> 07:41.748
Sam, you okay?

07:41.750 --> 07:44.835
Pull the fire alarm
and head down to the street.

07:46.671 --> 07:51.174
Um, what are you
gonna be doing?

07:51.176 --> 07:53.493
Getting my bullets back.

07:53.495 --> 07:56.129
We were never here, remember?

08:04.605 --> 08:06.840
Bekhti's wiring
was a bit rough.

08:06.842 --> 08:08.942
I fixed it for them.

08:08.944 --> 08:11.278
That's nice of you.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.813
You're making your own way out.

08:12.815 --> 08:14.731
Sure you don't want
some company?

08:14.733 --> 08:16.208
Why, you know anybody?

08:16.819 --> 08:19.035
I'll see you when I see you.

08:19.037 --> 08:20.737
I'll see you tomorrow.

08:20.739 --> 08:22.155
Where?

08:22.157 --> 08:23.740
New York City.

08:23.742 --> 08:26.908
Control called.
We got another number.

08:28.580 --> 08:32.082
I guess it's like you said.
They never stop coming.

08:37.369 --> 08:43.275
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

08:45.868 --> 08:48.270
- How is New York?
- Cold.

08:48.272 --> 08:50.555
I'm meeting
with Wilson tonight.

08:54.310 --> 08:56.561
Since when do you
make deliveries?

08:56.563 --> 08:59.097
I was in town for a meeting.

08:59.099 --> 09:01.300
Thought I'd congratulate
my best operator.

09:01.302 --> 09:03.035
Tell me this.

09:03.037 --> 09:04.987
Don't we pay you
to disarm bombs

09:04.989 --> 09:07.456
rather than set them off?

09:09.409 --> 09:11.910
My call.
We had the cesium.

09:11.912 --> 09:14.388
Seemed like the best way
to cover our tracks.

09:16.300 --> 09:18.447
Thank you.
Unofficially.

09:19.970 --> 09:21.702
Your new number.

09:43.826 --> 09:45.944
I've still got eyes
on our new number.

09:45.946 --> 09:47.746
He's been walking
in circles for an hour, Cole.

09:47.748 --> 09:49.247
I'm getting a little bored.

09:49.249 --> 09:50.615
Tell me a story.

09:50.617 --> 09:52.367
James Mercer.

09:52.369 --> 09:54.369
Did four in the corps.

09:54.371 --> 09:55.704
A dishonorable discharge.

09:55.706 --> 09:58.206
Graduates to the militia
movement.

09:58.208 --> 09:59.758
And then a week ago,

09:59.760 --> 10:02.711
he gets wired 10k
from an offshore account,

10:02.713 --> 10:04.429
and moves to Queens.

10:04.431 --> 10:05.997
I'm guessing research
doesn't think he's here

10:05.999 --> 10:07.368
for a Broadway show.

10:17.510 --> 10:19.010
Cole, I think I've been made.

10:19.012 --> 10:21.396
My 3:00,
good-looking guy in a suit.

10:21.398 --> 10:23.181
You sure he's not just
checking you out?

10:23.183 --> 10:26.435
Forgot your gas mask, Shaw.

10:26.437 --> 10:28.629
All right, false alarm.

10:32.542 --> 10:34.242
Incoming.

10:34.244 --> 10:37.295
Mercer's getting a call.

10:37.297 --> 10:40.255
It's time.
Tomorrow's the big day.

10:41.969 --> 10:45.137
We need to get a look
at this guy's computer tonight.

10:45.139 --> 10:47.639
You may even have to get
out of the van.

10:55.231 --> 10:59.067
Is something wrong with you?

10:59.069 --> 11:01.820
You're not still pining
for that girl in Staad.

11:03.239 --> 11:05.941
You ever wonder
where Research gets the numbers?

11:09.078 --> 11:12.197
- No.
- Why?

11:12.199 --> 11:14.082
Because I don't work
for Research.

11:14.084 --> 11:16.785
Did you ever think
they could be wrong sometimes?

11:18.404 --> 11:20.589
Like that guy in San Jose.
Aquino.

11:20.591 --> 11:21.906
Two years ago.

11:21.908 --> 11:25.544
He was...
so confused.

11:25.546 --> 11:27.412
- You remember what he said?
- I do.

11:27.414 --> 11:29.247
Because...

11:29.249 --> 11:30.748
I'm the one that killed him

11:30.750 --> 11:33.077
while you just watched
on your little camera.

11:34.354 --> 11:36.598
I also remember...

11:37.141 --> 11:38.774
that he was trying
to sell designs

11:38.776 --> 11:41.143
for a nuclear centrifuge
to Hezbollah.

11:41.145 --> 11:44.279
And you tracked
the money trail.

11:44.281 --> 11:47.032
Research was right
about Aquino.

11:47.034 --> 11:48.567
Like they're always right.

11:48.569 --> 11:50.952
How can you be so sure
that they are never wrong

11:50.954 --> 11:53.462
if you have no idea
who they even are...

11:54.441 --> 11:56.774
or where they get
these numbers?

11:56.776 --> 11:58.776
I know exactly where they get
those damn numbers from, Cole,

11:58.778 --> 12:01.863
and so do you.

12:01.865 --> 12:05.167
From a dark room somewhere
where they hurt people badly.

12:05.169 --> 12:07.118
And the reason we don't ask

12:07.120 --> 12:08.820
where Research
gets its numbers from

12:08.822 --> 12:12.390
is because Research
is never wrong.

12:12.392 --> 12:14.126
Well, they were this time.

12:16.263 --> 12:18.628
You did something stupid,
didn't you?

12:19.483 --> 12:21.016
I called on one of my friends
from the agency,

12:21.018 --> 12:23.101
asked her to trace the money.

12:23.103 --> 12:25.320
Those transfers
didn't come from Hezbollah.

12:25.322 --> 12:27.856
They came
from the US Government.

12:27.858 --> 12:29.691
Aquino was doing
something covert,

12:29.693 --> 12:31.526
but he was doing it for us.

12:31.528 --> 12:33.662
I called Control.
Wilson.

12:33.664 --> 12:36.314
I mean, I've requested
an internal investigation.

12:36.316 --> 12:38.083
I will keep you out of it,
I promise.

12:38.085 --> 12:39.367
You talked to Wilson?

12:39.369 --> 12:40.702
Yeah.

12:43.073 --> 12:44.929
Mercer's on the move.

12:46.793 --> 12:49.521
And we still have a job to do...

12:49.523 --> 12:50.736
remember?

13:11.327 --> 13:13.044
Whoa, all right.
I'm in.

13:13.046 --> 13:15.297
That was easy.

13:15.299 --> 13:17.799
Anything?

13:17.801 --> 13:19.885
This is not right.

13:19.887 --> 13:23.454
Mercer's got a bunch of emails
from some contacts--

13:23.456 --> 13:25.473
ex-military.

13:25.475 --> 13:27.321
Do you have the name
of the contacts?

13:28.412 --> 13:29.941
Yeah.

13:31.398 --> 13:32.704
They're us.

13:34.234 --> 13:36.451
Our names are all over
these files.

13:43.523 --> 13:46.564
_

13:49.999 --> 13:51.750
Shaw?
Shaw!

14:21.314 --> 14:23.398
We need to move.
Now.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.641
Ah, that's gonna be tough.

14:27.204 --> 14:28.903
- All right, come on.
- Ah!

14:31.041 --> 14:34.287
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, don't talk.

14:35.379 --> 14:36.720
All right.

14:37.664 --> 14:40.198
Look, I'm gonna call Control,
and, uh...

14:40.200 --> 14:42.606
we're gonna get you some help.

14:44.537 --> 14:46.304
I was trying to get your back.

14:46.306 --> 14:47.872
Always trying to be
the hero, huh?

14:49.426 --> 14:51.559
No.

14:51.561 --> 14:53.558
Just yours.

15:04.190 --> 15:06.760
Second Team, head in.

15:27.347 --> 15:29.514
Shaw...

15:29.516 --> 15:32.133
listen.
My name is John.

15:32.135 --> 15:34.936
I'm here to help you.

15:37.690 --> 15:38.930
Team Three, move into position.

15:45.114 --> 15:48.366
Aah!

15:54.740 --> 15:57.075
This is Team Two.
I think she may have backup.

15:57.077 --> 16:01.663
There's some other guy in he--

16:07.254 --> 16:10.955
All teams, check in.
Did you kill the woman or not?

16:10.957 --> 16:12.477
Wilson?

16:50.680 --> 16:52.013
Yes?

16:52.015 --> 16:53.348
We got a problem.

16:53.350 --> 16:54.956
I lost her.

16:56.503 --> 17:00.555
I would say that's a little
more than a problem, Wilson.

17:10.979 --> 17:12.561
We took care of Cole.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.364
Shaw managed to shoot
her way out.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.401
I lost a full team.
It's a bit of a mess.

17:17.403 --> 17:20.420
That's... unfortunate.

17:20.422 --> 17:21.598
Just a moment.

17:24.108 --> 17:28.295
- That's everything you need
for your 10:00 AM with State.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.380
Will you need anything else?

17:30.382 --> 17:32.282
No, thank you, Miss May.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.617
- Have a nice evening.
- You too, sir.

17:40.341 --> 17:41.892
So you're telling me

17:41.894 --> 17:44.794
we've got a lethal operative
off the leash

17:44.796 --> 17:46.963
who's aware we terminated
her partner

17:46.965 --> 17:49.149
and tried to do the same to her

17:49.151 --> 17:51.801
and who may have information

17:51.803 --> 17:54.488
which endangers
our entire project.

17:54.490 --> 17:57.086
That seems to be
the situation, sir.

17:58.444 --> 18:00.923
First, she'll be looking
to regroup.

18:02.331 --> 18:05.648
Transportation, weapons,
a place to hide.

18:05.650 --> 18:08.502
- But we may have an edge.
- What's that?

18:08.504 --> 18:10.498
I'm pretty sure I clipped her.

18:22.083 --> 18:23.454
Mm.

18:24.086 --> 18:25.586
What you need tonight, girl?

18:25.588 --> 18:28.222
You know, I just need
a little bit of daylight.

18:28.224 --> 18:30.079
Sunshine.

18:34.045 --> 18:35.796
I got you.

18:37.732 --> 18:40.601
Whoa!

18:40.603 --> 18:42.270
Hold on!

18:43.889 --> 18:46.974
Lewis?

18:46.976 --> 18:49.209
If your dumb ass is here,

18:49.211 --> 18:51.662
who the hell is out
on the corner?

18:53.749 --> 18:56.399
Ah!

18:56.401 --> 18:58.401
You ever have a staring
contest with a fish?

18:58.403 --> 19:00.170
- What?
- No eyelids.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.405
Kinda pointless, right?

19:02.407 --> 19:04.055
Like you reaching
for that scattergun.

19:06.128 --> 19:07.229
Back up.

19:15.419 --> 19:17.187
Okay, there, Lewis.

19:17.189 --> 19:18.939
I'm gonna need you to ziptie
your friend to the radiator.

19:18.941 --> 19:20.329
Nice and tight.

19:28.283 --> 19:30.433
Uh, Lewis,
I'm gonna need some things.

19:30.435 --> 19:33.454
Painkillers, razor blades,
and if...

19:33.456 --> 19:36.408
there's no gauze, then towels.

19:42.947 --> 19:44.164
Hollow point.

19:44.166 --> 19:46.967
Son of a bitch!

19:46.969 --> 19:49.553
Seen shots like that before.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.305
You're gut shot.

19:51.307 --> 19:53.957
- You're done.
- You better hope not.

19:53.959 --> 19:56.760
'Cause if I start
to lose consciousness,

19:56.762 --> 19:59.313
I'm shooting you first.

20:04.319 --> 20:06.904
Sit down, Lewis.

20:26.541 --> 20:28.675
Have you done this before?

20:28.677 --> 20:30.351
You're pretty good at it.

20:31.297 --> 20:33.163
I was in med school for a bit.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.399
- You're a doctor?
- No.

20:35.401 --> 20:38.501
Joined the Marines.

20:38.503 --> 20:40.888
Figured I was better
at killing people

20:40.890 --> 20:42.379
than fixing them.

20:42.380 --> 20:43.814
Yeah.

20:44.026 --> 20:46.109
I'm about
to lose consciousness,

20:46.111 --> 20:47.719
so, uh...

20:48.280 --> 20:51.398
I need you to ziptie yourself
along with your friend, okay?

21:26.485 --> 21:28.385
I always knew
you was an idiot, Lewis.

21:38.079 --> 21:40.280
Hey, you.

21:40.282 --> 21:44.785
Nice piece.

21:44.787 --> 21:49.039
Who the hell you supposed to be,
some kinda badass?

21:50.758 --> 21:52.409
Not really.

21:52.411 --> 21:55.379
I have what's called
an Axis II Personality Disorder.

21:55.381 --> 21:58.015
What's that supposed to mean?

21:58.017 --> 21:59.850
It means when I kill
you and your friends,

21:59.852 --> 22:02.135
I'm not really gonna
feel anything.

22:02.137 --> 22:05.588
Oh!

22:05.590 --> 22:07.261
You gonna kill me?

22:08.277 --> 22:12.145
You weight what,
hundred pounds?

22:12.147 --> 22:15.532
9mm round weighs about
a quarter of an ounce.

22:15.534 --> 22:18.118
It gets the job done.

22:19.654 --> 22:22.155
But your gun's a .45,
little girl.

22:22.157 --> 22:24.658
I was talking
about my backup piece.

22:35.119 --> 22:37.471
Lewis, go.

22:39.424 --> 22:41.640
If you tell anybody about me...

22:43.012 --> 22:45.118
I will find you.

23:07.669 --> 23:11.788
Shaw is one of our best.
Trained her myself.

23:11.790 --> 23:15.258
You're not gonna find her
until she wants to be found.

23:15.260 --> 23:17.461
We need to know her game plan.

23:17.463 --> 23:20.380
Is Shaw going to look
into the Aquino situation,

23:20.382 --> 23:24.718
or simply come after us
for revenge?

23:24.720 --> 23:26.937
Both.

23:26.939 --> 23:29.973
She's a multitasker.
It's why we hired her.

23:29.975 --> 23:32.675
We need to track down
Cole's contact in the CIA.

23:32.677 --> 23:35.946
I'm already on it.
Her name is Veronica Sinclair.

23:48.376 --> 23:51.464
What did you find, partner?

23:57.753 --> 23:59.252
Hello?

23:59.254 --> 24:00.637
Hello, Veronica.

24:00.639 --> 24:02.055
I wanna talk to you
about Michael Cole.

24:02.057 --> 24:03.807
Who is this?

24:03.809 --> 24:05.708
Whatever you told him...

24:05.710 --> 24:07.511
may have gotten him killed.

24:07.513 --> 24:10.046
Please.
I can't be involved in this.

24:10.048 --> 24:12.733
Well, you either meet me
or I track you down.

24:12.735 --> 24:16.336
And that is not something
that you want.

24:16.338 --> 24:19.339
Manhattan, the Suffolk Hotel,

24:19.341 --> 24:23.143
room 1458,
5:00 PM tomorrow.

24:23.145 --> 24:25.147
I'll be there.

24:31.787 --> 24:33.236
Shaw.

24:33.238 --> 24:35.338
Figured you'd be calling me
sooner or later.

24:35.340 --> 24:36.873
You should really come in, Sam.

24:36.875 --> 24:39.209
You know there's no point
in running from us.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.595
I'll turn myself in,
but only to the boss.

24:41.597 --> 24:45.415
- I wanna meet Control.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

24:45.417 --> 24:47.768
I call my boss,
you try to kill him.

24:47.770 --> 24:49.219
It's very embarrassing for me.

24:49.221 --> 24:51.087
I will send you the location.

24:51.089 --> 24:52.939
You make sure he's there,

24:52.941 --> 24:55.609
or else I go public
with the Aquino files.

24:58.429 --> 25:00.363
- When?
- Tonight.

25:00.365 --> 25:03.817
And, Wilson,
don't keep me waiting.

25:16.581 --> 25:20.717
- Hello, Veronica.
- Come in.

25:32.494 --> 25:35.129
Any chance you were followed?

25:35.131 --> 25:37.715
I don't think so, but...

25:37.717 --> 25:41.140
I haven't been in the field
since I was at the farm.

25:41.788 --> 25:44.239
You're Sam, right?

25:44.241 --> 25:46.758
Michael talked about you.

25:46.760 --> 25:50.061
I mean, he didn't tell me about
what you guys do or anything,

25:50.063 --> 25:52.797
but... he liked you.

25:54.934 --> 25:56.484
What happened to him?

25:57.086 --> 25:58.857
He was killed.

26:01.107 --> 26:03.409
On a mission.

26:04.877 --> 26:06.827
The less you know
about all of this,

26:06.829 --> 26:08.379
the safer you'll be.

26:08.381 --> 26:10.878
But I do need to know
what he talked to you about.

26:11.968 --> 26:16.721
Mike sent over details
of wire transfers

26:16.723 --> 26:19.623
to a nuclear engineer
named Daniel Aquino.

26:19.625 --> 26:21.392
They appeared to originate

26:21.394 --> 26:24.628
out of accounts affiliated
with Hezbollah, but...

26:24.630 --> 26:27.631
someone had electronically
spoofed the transfers.

26:27.633 --> 26:29.734
I was able to track down

26:29.736 --> 26:32.603
the real originating accounts.

26:32.605 --> 26:34.939
They were out
of the US Government.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.307
Which part of the government?

26:36.309 --> 26:37.742
A group out of the Pentagon

26:37.744 --> 26:41.650
called the Intelligence
Support Activity.

26:42.648 --> 26:44.198
Have you heard of them?

26:44.200 --> 26:46.497
You could say that.

26:47.420 --> 26:49.920
Up until yesterday,
I worked for them.

26:49.922 --> 26:51.539
Their budget's confidential,

26:51.541 --> 26:54.592
but... it stretches
back five years.

26:54.594 --> 26:56.677
Huge amounts coded to a project

26:56.679 --> 26:58.629
called Northern Lights.

26:58.631 --> 26:59.964
What was the project?

26:59.966 --> 27:01.165
I don't know.

27:01.167 --> 27:03.351
But Aquino was part of it.

27:03.353 --> 27:05.803
They built a facility
of some kind

27:05.805 --> 27:07.504
coded as Research.

27:07.506 --> 27:08.839
But I can't find the names

27:08.841 --> 27:10.841
of anyone else involved
in the project.

27:12.362 --> 27:16.680
Mike said Aquino told you
the name of his contact

27:16.682 --> 27:18.515
in Northern Lights.

27:18.517 --> 27:19.850
Do you remember it?

27:21.921 --> 27:23.120
Stay here.

27:23.122 --> 27:24.905
And keep away
from those windows.

27:39.471 --> 27:44.308
Veronica and I had a bit
of a chat before you got here.

27:44.310 --> 27:47.478
She tried really, really hard
to remember anything else

27:47.480 --> 27:49.930
that could help me, but...

27:49.932 --> 27:51.859
she didn't know anything.

27:55.737 --> 28:00.667
I read your file,
and I'm kind of a big fan.

28:00.743 --> 28:04.829
So, I really don't
wanna hurt you.

28:04.831 --> 28:07.398
I just need the name.

28:07.400 --> 28:11.502
You really have no idea what
you're caught up in, do you?

28:11.504 --> 28:14.707
Who you're actually
working for?

28:17.960 --> 28:20.411
Did you honestly think
the source of the numbers

28:20.413 --> 28:22.246
was Guantanamo?

28:22.248 --> 28:23.597
Some sad taxi driver

28:23.599 --> 28:25.349
rotting away
in a cage somewhere?

28:25.351 --> 28:27.251
I mean, you should know

28:27.253 --> 28:30.590
torture almost never produces
good information.

28:32.425 --> 28:34.140
Well...

28:35.478 --> 28:37.107
almost never.

28:38.981 --> 28:40.648
Sadly,

28:40.650 --> 28:44.268
we are on a bit of a clock.

28:44.270 --> 28:47.071
Wilson's men started looking
for Veronica here

28:47.073 --> 28:49.874
three hours ago.

28:49.876 --> 28:52.493
Mm!

28:52.495 --> 28:53.689
Now...

28:55.081 --> 28:59.216
Aquino was hired
to build a home

28:59.218 --> 29:01.385
for something very special,

29:01.387 --> 29:04.388
something I wanna find.

29:07.559 --> 29:11.395
So you're gonna tell me
the name of his contact.

29:13.849 --> 29:18.152
One of the things
I left out of my file...

29:18.154 --> 29:20.604
I kind of enjoy
this sort of thing.

29:21.806 --> 29:24.148
I am so glad you said that.

29:24.643 --> 29:26.249
I do too.

29:35.670 --> 29:38.005
Oh.

29:38.007 --> 29:41.425
And just when we were starting
to really connect.

29:41.427 --> 29:43.377
I'm sorry.

29:43.379 --> 29:45.463
A little rude, I know.

29:45.465 --> 29:48.665
We'll do this again soon.

30:00.979 --> 30:02.539
Clear!

30:03.015 --> 30:04.348
All clear.

30:04.350 --> 30:07.318
Indigo located.
And the secondary.

30:07.320 --> 30:10.404
Instructions?

30:10.406 --> 30:12.141
Understood.

30:49.411 --> 30:51.979
Can you do me a favor?

30:52.081 --> 30:54.742
Can you not shoot me this time?

30:54.951 --> 30:57.034
- Give me a good reason.
- I don't know.

30:57.036 --> 30:58.586
I'm a really nice person,

30:58.588 --> 31:02.271
and, well... that.

31:05.460 --> 31:06.758
May I?

31:09.382 --> 31:11.077
Okay.

31:13.052 --> 31:14.768
It's probably acontine.

31:14.770 --> 31:16.887
You can counteract it
with atropine...

31:16.889 --> 31:18.472
in case I bump it.

31:18.474 --> 31:20.975
The dose we use,
you've got about four minutes.

31:20.977 --> 31:22.726
So unless you've got
some atropine on you,

31:22.728 --> 31:24.734
don't bump it.

31:30.952 --> 31:33.587
I got a friend
who wants to talk to you.

31:33.906 --> 31:35.439
Why would I wanna talk
to one of your friends?

31:35.441 --> 31:38.208
You got somewhere better to be?

32:05.604 --> 32:07.447
Hello, Ms. Shaw.

32:09.325 --> 32:11.655
You can call me Harold.

32:25.184 --> 32:27.118
You're the man in charge?

32:27.120 --> 32:29.354
No.
No one's in charge.

32:29.356 --> 32:32.140
My friend and I
help people in trouble.

32:32.142 --> 32:37.045
Or maybe you work for Wilson
and this is all some kinda game.

32:37.047 --> 32:39.280
Honestly, I was never
terribly good at games.

32:39.282 --> 32:43.184
You work--
or at least you used to work--

32:43.186 --> 32:44.819
for a secret government program

32:44.821 --> 32:47.121
that prevents terrible things--

32:47.123 --> 32:51.175
terrorist acts and crimes
relevant to nation security.

32:51.177 --> 32:53.578
The information
that you received

32:53.580 --> 32:56.581
came from a group of people
that you call Research.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.366
And it's notable
for two reasons.

32:58.368 --> 32:59.968
One, it's never wrong.

32:59.970 --> 33:03.171
And two, it consists
only of a number.

33:12.231 --> 33:14.983
- This is--
- Your number.

33:14.985 --> 33:16.684
And Mr. Cole's.

33:16.686 --> 33:20.455
We were unable to save him,
and for that, I'm sorry.

33:20.457 --> 33:22.657
We didn't understand
the exact nature

33:22.659 --> 33:24.923
of your situation at first.

33:26.529 --> 33:28.896
So if you're not part
of the program...

33:28.898 --> 33:30.926
then who are you?

33:32.636 --> 33:34.335
Let's just say that ultimately,

33:34.337 --> 33:36.504
you and I work
for the same entity.

33:36.506 --> 33:38.423
And that entity wanted you
and your friend over there

33:38.425 --> 33:39.457
to help me?

33:39.459 --> 33:41.376
In a manner of speaking.

33:41.378 --> 33:43.678
In truth, we're probably the
only people who can help you.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.513
Well, if you know so much
about my employers,

33:45.515 --> 33:48.249
then you must know
that they are very...

33:48.251 --> 33:51.219
very good at finding people.

33:51.221 --> 33:53.388
Even you can't run forever.

33:53.390 --> 33:54.922
I don't need forever.

33:54.924 --> 33:57.191
Just long enough to find
the man behind the curtain,

33:57.193 --> 33:59.644
the one who gave
the kill order.

33:59.646 --> 34:00.862
You won't even scratch

34:00.864 --> 34:02.397
the surface
of their organization,

34:02.399 --> 34:05.466
and you'll still be
in grave danger.

34:05.468 --> 34:08.518
You hold a piece of a puzzle,

34:08.521 --> 34:11.039
a secret so important
that they were willing to kill

34:11.041 --> 34:13.708
Dr. Aquino and your friend
Michael Cole and yourself

34:13.710 --> 34:15.326
to protect it.

34:15.328 --> 34:18.556
The truth about a group
of people you call Research.

34:19.114 --> 34:22.717
Something that Cole
had begun to suspect.

34:22.719 --> 34:25.855
- Which is what?
- That they don't exist.

34:30.976 --> 34:33.960
The world looks like it did
ten years ago,

34:33.963 --> 34:38.266
but underneath,
it's become very strange indeed.

34:38.268 --> 34:40.650
An invisible struggle
has begun.

34:40.652 --> 34:43.628
Most of the people
who knew this are already dead.

34:46.141 --> 34:49.068
All things being equal,
I prefer you didn't join them.

34:50.813 --> 34:53.781
So like I said...
We're here to help you.

34:53.783 --> 34:55.649
But first,
you need to stop running

34:55.650 --> 34:58.486
because you're much too good
it and we can't keep up.

34:58.488 --> 35:01.506
- Hiding isn't my style.
- But dying is?

35:01.508 --> 35:03.508
Because, as I see it,
that's your only option.

35:03.510 --> 35:05.293
You know,
I never had many friends.

35:05.295 --> 35:07.088
Didn't have much use for 'em.

35:09.499 --> 35:11.250
Cole was an exception.

35:13.386 --> 35:15.179
And he deserved better.

35:17.840 --> 35:20.594
A word of advice
for what it's worth.

35:21.478 --> 35:23.728
Set out to correct
the world's wrongs

35:23.730 --> 35:27.398
and you'll almost certainly
wind up adding to them.

35:30.269 --> 35:33.160
My number,
in case you change your mind.

35:39.877 --> 35:41.296
Thanks.

35:44.750 --> 35:46.618
But no thanks.

35:55.094 --> 35:57.044
It's time to end this.
Tonight.

35:57.046 --> 35:59.313
- Get a team ready.
- Yes, sir.

36:19.751 --> 36:21.702
You're late.

36:21.704 --> 36:23.504
I'd ask how you knew it was me,

36:23.506 --> 36:25.173
but I guess that's
what we pay you for--

36:25.175 --> 36:28.631
picking the right person
out of a crowd.

36:30.146 --> 36:32.337
Of course I wanted
to meet Control.

36:33.583 --> 36:36.417
And you're not Control, now,
are you?

36:36.419 --> 36:39.220
Sadly, no.

36:39.222 --> 36:41.472
But I'm as close
as you're gonna get.

36:41.474 --> 36:43.057
Hmm.

36:43.059 --> 36:45.109
You'd really put
the program in jeopardy

36:45.111 --> 36:47.676
just to avenge your partner?

36:48.114 --> 36:50.097
I assumed a woman like you

36:50.099 --> 36:53.372
would have a more sophisticated
world view.

36:54.237 --> 36:57.321
You people hired me because
I don't care about most people.

36:57.323 --> 36:58.873
And then you went and killed

36:58.875 --> 37:01.159
the one person
that I actually liked.

37:01.161 --> 37:03.361
Fair enough.

37:04.614 --> 37:06.464
Of course, you weren't supposed
to be around

37:06.466 --> 37:08.589
to carry a grudge.

37:09.552 --> 37:10.918
You wanted to meet.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.953
Was it to find out
why I let Wilson

37:12.955 --> 37:15.069
target you and your partner?

37:15.625 --> 37:17.378
Or just to kill me?

37:18.144 --> 37:20.928
Either way, we should go
somewhere more private.

37:23.031 --> 37:26.817
You probably think
I made a devil's bargain.

37:26.819 --> 37:28.986
And maybe I have.

37:28.988 --> 37:30.404
But the program is the reason

37:30.406 --> 37:32.640
we haven't had
another major attack.

37:32.642 --> 37:35.026
If the public knew
about what we do,

37:35.028 --> 37:36.494
we'd lose that ability.

37:36.496 --> 37:38.696
And Aquino?

37:38.698 --> 37:41.532
Again, a regrettable decision,

37:41.534 --> 37:43.534
but a necessary one.

37:43.536 --> 37:48.689
No one life is above the safety
of millions of Americans.

37:48.691 --> 37:53.961
That's the ugly math that
I have to deal with every day.

37:53.963 --> 37:56.297
You of all people
should understand that.

37:56.299 --> 37:59.333
I do.

37:59.335 --> 38:02.019
And if I were in your place,
I'd do the exact same thing.

38:03.805 --> 38:05.640
I may not be
in the program anymore,

38:05.642 --> 38:07.174
but I--

38:07.176 --> 38:09.277
I still understand
how important it is.

38:09.279 --> 38:11.729
Then why the cloak and dagger?

38:15.350 --> 38:19.186
Cole's research
on the Aquino case.

38:20.856 --> 38:23.858
I wanted to give it to you
personally.

38:23.860 --> 38:26.043
Why not give it to Wilson?

38:26.045 --> 38:27.245
You can't hire people like Cole

38:27.247 --> 38:28.529
and expect them
to act like sheep.

38:28.531 --> 38:30.381
Now, I know
how to follow orders.

38:30.383 --> 38:31.799
But Cole was just brilliant,

38:31.801 --> 38:33.251
and he believed in the cause.

38:33.253 --> 38:35.320
And Wilson knew that.

38:37.223 --> 38:39.407
You know,
you could've warned him.

38:39.409 --> 38:40.608
Or even me.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.059
But instead,
you placed a kill order

38:42.061 --> 38:43.678
like we were some kinda problem
to be solved.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.663
Your partner broke the rules.

38:45.665 --> 38:47.732
You're on the hook for that
as much as he was.

38:47.734 --> 38:51.269
And then you screwed that up
in such a spectacular fashion.

38:52.738 --> 38:56.324
How could I trust this idiot
with something so important?

38:58.076 --> 39:00.077
Hersh was right.

39:00.079 --> 39:02.306
You are a good soldier.

39:02.782 --> 39:05.284
You didn't want revenge.

39:06.235 --> 39:08.536
You wanted to protect
the program.

39:08.538 --> 39:11.876
A good soldier does both.

39:19.265 --> 39:21.415
Let her go.

39:32.311 --> 39:34.195

unresponsive to CPR.

40:41.330 --> 40:43.597
EMT's called it
as soon as they arrived.

40:43.599 --> 40:45.954
So this looks
like a homicide to you?

40:46.352 --> 40:48.969
Sure. Woman her age,
not a mark on her.

40:48.971 --> 40:50.521
I thought it suspicious.

40:50.523 --> 40:52.723
Can't expect the task force
to show up.

40:52.725 --> 40:55.142
We were in the neighborhood,
Officer Fleming.

40:55.144 --> 40:58.312
Yeah, we're probably looking at
an overdose or cardiac arrest.

40:58.314 --> 41:00.514
Yeah, but, I mean,
just to make sure, we ought to--

41:00.516 --> 41:01.732
Why don't you grab yourself
a coffee?

41:01.734 --> 41:02.939
We got this, okay?

41:03.853 --> 41:06.890
Thanks for your help.

41:07.356 --> 41:10.524
It's a full moon.
Coroner's Office is swamped.

41:10.526 --> 41:13.734
You mind getting her downtown?

41:14.697 --> 41:16.328
Whatever you say, Detective.

41:18.417 --> 41:20.641

41:46.412 --> 41:48.446
but that's one broad
I never wanna see again.

41:48.448 --> 41:50.114
I mean, ever!

41:50.116 --> 41:53.784
You guys never told me
she was dangerous <i>and</i> crazy!

41:53.786 --> 41:55.169
Bad combo.

41:55.171 --> 41:56.253
What happened?

41:56.255 --> 41:58.038
I gave her the atropine

41:58.040 --> 41:59.757
and some demerol
to knock her out.

41:59.759 --> 42:02.626
But she woke up
on the drive over

42:02.628 --> 42:03.928
and almost killed me!

42:03.930 --> 42:06.046
Look-- look at this bruise
on my neck.

42:06.048 --> 42:07.915
So I gave her some more.

42:07.917 --> 42:10.634
How much more, Mr. Tao?

42:10.636 --> 42:14.605
I don't know.
I look like a doctor to you?

42:14.607 --> 42:16.089
Man.

42:16.091 --> 42:18.425
I so don't get paid enough
for this crap.

42:18.427 --> 42:21.717
We don't pay you anything,
Leon.

42:23.316 --> 42:26.367
I'm gonna widen the distance,
fellas.

42:26.369 --> 42:28.101
You take your chances.

42:34.126 --> 42:36.243
Dying can make you thirsty.

42:41.450 --> 42:42.750
For guardian angels,

42:42.752 --> 42:44.335
you two were a bit late
to the party.

42:44.337 --> 42:46.504
Your employers wanted you dead.

42:46.506 --> 42:48.227
So now you are.

42:50.476 --> 42:52.510
I guess Leon forgot
the instructions

42:52.512 --> 42:54.061
about patting you down.

42:54.063 --> 42:56.013
Ms. Shaw,
we're on your side.

42:56.015 --> 42:58.682
I feel like we've proven
that you can trust us.

42:58.684 --> 43:00.679
Trust is overrated.

43:00.736 --> 43:02.135
Toss me your phones.

43:09.245 --> 43:11.160
Like I said before...

43:12.855 --> 43:15.280
