WEBVTT

00:36.736 --> 00:37.771
Ah!

00:41.141 --> 00:43.212
Here we go. Lock it in.

00:43.276 --> 00:44.584
When it gets hard, push harder.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.618
Let the weight do what it does.

00:59.926 --> 01:01.371
Bummer.

01:13.506 --> 01:14.849
Whoa.

01:25.351 --> 01:27.695
Oh, man.

01:30.723 --> 01:32.930
Not my Iron Butterfly.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.630
Mr. Lasser, you said you walked
outside just before it exploded?

01:35.695 --> 01:37.038
Well, yeah, Detective.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.867
If I would have been in there,

01:38.932 --> 01:40.172
I wouldn't be out here.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.006
Xena Warrior Princess,

01:45.271 --> 01:47.751
Issue 17. This was a classic.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.209
Mr. Lasser.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.189
We have a lot of people out here
investigating the explosion.

01:53.580 --> 01:54.650
If you were involved in

01:54.714 --> 01:56.751
any kind of bomb-making,
now is the time to let me know.

01:56.816 --> 01:57.851
Before anybody gets hurt.

01:57.917 --> 01:59.225
Bomb-making?

01:59.519 --> 02:01.897
Me? I wouldn't know
how to do any of that.

02:05.391 --> 02:06.529
Everything I love was in there.

02:11.531 --> 02:12.874
My entire life.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.439
My brother's baseball cards!

02:16.569 --> 02:17.570
Now, if my brother knew about this,

02:17.637 --> 02:19.173
he would crap a car.

02:19.706 --> 02:20.912
Shouldn't he be happy you're alive?

02:20.974 --> 02:21.975
How is he going to hear?

02:22.175 --> 02:23.745
Hey, you're going to need
a place to stay tonight.

02:23.910 --> 02:25.014
Why don't you give
your brother a call?

02:25.979 --> 02:28.186
Your cell phone is not
that good, Detective.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.992
He didn't make it out.
Didn't make it out of what?

02:31.084 --> 02:32.563
His double wide.

02:33.853 --> 02:36.094
The same thing happened
to him last month,

02:36.156 --> 02:37.430
with him in it.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.331
He's so dead.

03:00.446 --> 03:03.154
Yeah, just, boom, man.
Just blown up.

03:03.216 --> 03:05.423
It's like a crater.

03:05.485 --> 03:07.260
The old dome is toast.

03:07.854 --> 03:08.924
But I...

03:08.988 --> 03:10.729
I got nowhere else to go.

03:11.057 --> 03:14.504
So, how about it, man?
Just till I get back on my feet?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.368
Please?

03:17.630 --> 03:18.938
Just for old time's sake?

03:19.332 --> 03:21.107
I've got to go.
They're all up in my grill.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.071
So, let's try to figure out
who might want to harm you.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.376
Detective. Listen, bro.

03:25.605 --> 03:27.380
I'm a pretty happy guy.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.850
That's the reason the name
Hap works so well for me.

03:29.909 --> 03:32.253
I love everybody,
and everybody loves me.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.721
Even the guys I owe money to.

03:35.882 --> 03:36.986
Follow me.

04:21.861 --> 04:23.272
Uh, Jimmy Damon.

04:23.329 --> 04:25.331
I'm into him for about three grand.

04:25.398 --> 04:26.672
It's a bar thing.

04:26.733 --> 04:27.837
A bar tab?

04:29.269 --> 04:31.340
No, Jimmy Damon was for
a bar that I opened.

04:31.437 --> 04:32.916
He was one of my backers.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.551
It was a really, really great idea.

04:34.674 --> 04:38.019
You actually had your own bar
right there at your own table.

04:38.711 --> 04:40.156
We lost our shirts.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.859
Uh, then there's Sammy Runyon.

04:42.915 --> 04:46.385
I owe him, like, a couple grand.
Strip mall creperie.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.489
You know, those really
thin French pancakes?

04:48.588 --> 04:51.125
Now, pancakes are the new cupcakes.

04:51.190 --> 04:53.761
Or, at least,
they should have been.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.206
In fact, maybe I could
interest you guys

04:56.262 --> 04:59.038
in a really unique
investment opportunity.

04:59.098 --> 05:01.169
Was your brother on the hook
with any of these guys, too?

05:01.234 --> 05:02.474
No, man.

05:03.503 --> 05:04.880
Rolf was

05:05.305 --> 05:08.218
what you would consider
a really solid citizen.

05:12.011 --> 05:13.490
Any of these guys
ever threaten you?

05:13.646 --> 05:15.887
Well, yeah. All the time.
But it's just talk, right?

05:15.948 --> 05:17.552
Well, loan sharks break bones.

05:17.617 --> 05:18.652
They don't usually blow people up.

05:18.718 --> 05:19.753
It makes it harder
to get paid back.

05:19.852 --> 05:23.231
Well, according to the record, your
brother's death was never investigated as a
homicide.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.795
But due to the similarity
of the circumstances,

05:25.858 --> 05:28.065
can you think of anyone that might
want to harm you and your brother?

05:28.127 --> 05:29.697
No.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.643
We didn't hang around
the same kind of people.

05:32.699 --> 05:33.905
Excuse me.

05:33.966 --> 05:36.913
This guy says he's here
to pick up your vic?

05:38.304 --> 05:39.408
My main man, Monroe.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.109
I knew he wouldn't bail on me.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.685
Buddy! Hey...

05:42.775 --> 05:43.879
Don't we know that guy?

05:43.943 --> 05:45.081
All right. Oh, God!

05:45.144 --> 05:46.919
It's good to see you, man.
You, too.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.384
Yeah, that's the guy I thought
was involved in the kidnapping.

05:49.482 --> 05:51.393
He's the clock guy.
That's his friend?

05:51.451 --> 05:52.452
Thank you.

05:52.518 --> 05:53.861
I guess so.

05:53.920 --> 05:54.955
Hey, you want me to take this?

05:55.021 --> 05:57.797
No. No, Hank. I got this one.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.359
I'm going to go find
the arson investigator

05:59.425 --> 06:00.904
and tell him we're
coming down. Okay.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.701
Look at you, man.
It's so great to see you.

06:02.762 --> 06:04.241
You look awesome.
You know this guy?

06:04.397 --> 06:06.172
Yeah, it's my main man, Monroe.

06:06.232 --> 06:07.677
I told you he would come, didn't I?

06:07.734 --> 06:11.238
Hap and I went through a treatment
program together many years ago.

06:11.604 --> 06:13.914
You have to, you know,
honor the bond.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.676
Can I take him out of here?
Yeah, are we done?

06:15.742 --> 06:17.153
Can I go? Yeah, you can go,

06:17.210 --> 06:18.780
but you might want to lay
low for a couple of days

06:18.845 --> 06:20.188
until we figure out what
we've got going on here.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.115
You think someone's
trying to hurt him?

06:23.049 --> 06:24.050
We don't know.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.189
Can you keep an eye on
him for a couple of days?

06:28.187 --> 06:30.394
Whoa! You guys know each other?

06:31.090 --> 06:32.091
We've met.

06:32.291 --> 06:35.272
Oh, yeah? Where did you meet? Like,
at a party or something?

06:35.928 --> 06:37.464
Oh, wait. You didn't get arrested

06:37.530 --> 06:39.032
for doing some of the stuff
you used to do, did you?

06:39.098 --> 06:40.577
All right. Let's go. Come on.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.010
Time to go.

06:45.505 --> 06:47.416
So, you believe both
explosions were accidental?

06:47.540 --> 06:49.019
Yeah, that's how it appears to me.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.486
The inlet valve on
the propane stove

06:50.543 --> 06:52.079
from the geodesic
dome was corroded.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.751
Not exactly unheard of
in this wet climate.

06:54.814 --> 06:55.918
So, we had a propane leak.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.791
The guy's breaker
box was out of code.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.454
He turned on one
appliance too many.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.624
There was a spark.
That was the point of ignition.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.495
Now, in the older
brother's double wide,

07:03.756 --> 07:05.133
we had a nicked propane line.

07:05.191 --> 07:07.535
It was right next to a
frayed extension cord.

07:07.627 --> 07:10.005
Plus, there was severe
rodent infestation.

07:10.329 --> 07:11.933
Now, these rats,
what they like to do

07:11.998 --> 07:14.274
is sharpen their
teeth on power cords.

07:14.333 --> 07:15.641
Same principle, right?

07:15.735 --> 07:18.113
We've got gas plus spark.
Boom. Same result.

07:18.571 --> 07:21.882
Now, is it possible that someone
corroded the valve or frayed the cord?

07:22.442 --> 07:25.821
I get it. They're brothers.
It's a very weird coincidence.

07:25.878 --> 07:26.948
I tried to find a connection

07:27.013 --> 07:28.993
between the gas companies.
There wasn't any.

07:29.048 --> 07:30.755
The service companies
were different as well.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.022
Anything is possible.

07:32.084 --> 07:34.530
I've got nothing here
to indicate foul play.

07:34.687 --> 07:38.464
I did have the CSU team pull some
prints off the valves and the tanks.

07:38.658 --> 07:40.604
Nothing was a hit on the database.

07:40.693 --> 07:41.865
And you guys know how this works.

07:41.928 --> 07:45.102
I can't base my conclusions on the
fact that both victims were related.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.743
Now, it says here you were
contacted by an insurance adjuster.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.279
Yeah. Whenever there's
a loss of life,

07:49.335 --> 07:50.973
we try to work the case
off our desk quickly

07:51.037 --> 07:52.038
to aid the beneficiary.

07:52.171 --> 07:54.651
You know who the beneficiary was
from the first brother's death?

07:54.707 --> 07:56.846
I'm not given that information
unless it's a criminal case,

07:56.909 --> 07:59.515
but typically, it's next of kin.

07:59.579 --> 08:01.115
I wonder how many
are in that family.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.023
Maybe we should talk to Hap.

08:03.082 --> 08:05.494
All right, you do that,
and I'll contact the insurance company.

08:05.551 --> 08:06.894
Well, I'm here if you
guys need anything else.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.433
And keep me in the loop. I'd love
to know if we've got a bad guy here.

08:22.802 --> 08:24.440
You can wash up in there.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.211
My aim is to keep the toilet clean.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.842
Cool Your aim will help.

08:27.907 --> 08:30.751
I shower at 7:15 every
morning after Pilates.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.380
Please don't run the
water at that time.

08:32.445 --> 08:33.856
I like full pressure. Got you.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.517
Here's something to wear. Huh.

08:35.881 --> 08:37.919
What else? You went to Brown?

08:37.984 --> 08:40.828
You never told me that, Professor.
G rad school

08:41.754 --> 08:43.357
Hey, how about some underwears?

08:45.625 --> 08:47.161
Oh. No, no, no.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.397
No. Don't touch my clocks. Okay?

08:53.199 --> 08:54.735
The sofa pulls out to a bed.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.939
I like to finish breakfast
by 8:30 in the morning.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.750
The kitchen is in here.
Intruder alert.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.280
This is the kitchen.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.785
Hey, you don't happen to
have any schnapps, do you?

09:03.776 --> 09:06.518
And what about dinner,
huh? You want to get take-out?

09:06.579 --> 09:10.152
2417 Pork delivers, and if it's
more than 20 minutes, it's free!

09:10.383 --> 09:11.794
Pork and schnapps?

09:11.851 --> 09:13.057
Really? No.

09:13.152 --> 09:15.758
Peppermint schnapps. Then, pork.

09:18.724 --> 09:19.998
Oh, dude.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.233
Look, bro,

09:24.096 --> 09:25.803
I realize this is a little
inconvenient for you.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.543
It's a little
inconvenient for me, too.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.473
So, if you want me to leave

09:33.906 --> 09:36.978
just say, "Hap, dude,
you're a good old friend.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.545
"We shared some times.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.223
"But this is my space.

09:41.881 --> 09:43.986
"And you're not welcome in it."

09:50.122 --> 09:51.328
It's cool.

09:52.224 --> 09:53.328
I'll go.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.566
No. Hap?

10:00.166 --> 10:01.474
You can stay.

10:05.571 --> 10:07.551
But no hugs. All right. Awesome.

10:07.640 --> 10:08.675
Wild times!

10:09.742 --> 10:11.312
I'm done with the wild times.

10:11.377 --> 10:14.221
Right. Right. I can see that.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.760
Look, bro, I cheated
death last night.

10:17.183 --> 10:20.221
If that's not a wake-up call,
I don't know what is.

10:20.586 --> 10:22.827
But I'm going to clean up my act.

10:22.888 --> 10:24.731
This time, for reals.

10:24.924 --> 10:27.336
Starting tonight, with you.

10:28.961 --> 10:29.962
Okay.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.707
Yeah? Yeah.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.907
All right. Yeah.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.470
Now, how about that pork?

11:00.159 --> 11:01.263
A Grimm.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.202
This is going to be even
more fun than I thought.

11:05.264 --> 11:06.538
No, no, no, no, no! Don't hurt him!

11:08.968 --> 11:10.948
No, no, no, no, no.
Get down, man. Get down!

11:11.103 --> 11:13.413
Don't shoot her.
She's my sister, Angelina.

11:25.951 --> 11:28.363
He's killed more of our
ancestors than I can count.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.628
How can you know him?
How can you even talk to him?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.897
Well, it's complicated.

11:32.958 --> 11:34.596
What are you talking about?
He's a Grimm.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.936
What? No. He's a cop.

11:36.996 --> 11:38.441
Monroe, tell her she's wrong.

11:38.864 --> 11:41.401
She's not. He's a cop and a Grimm?

11:42.501 --> 11:43.673
Is that legal?

11:43.903 --> 11:45.678
Does somebody want to explain
to me why I'm not arresting her

11:45.738 --> 11:47.274
for assaulting a police officer?

11:47.339 --> 11:48.477
I was protecting my brother.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.316
Yeah, and your boyfriend. Ex.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.550
Long time ago. Okay.
You know what? This is insane.

11:53.612 --> 11:55.558
Three Blutbaden in a
room with one Grimm.

11:55.614 --> 11:57.184
And we're all having a little chat.

11:57.283 --> 11:58.523
We should be having dinner.

11:58.584 --> 12:00.564
He's not that kind.
There is only one kind.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.064
Just like there's
one kind of Blutbad?

12:02.121 --> 12:04.624
Well, kumbaya.
Let's all hold hands.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.364
I'd heard that you'd gone straight.
I just didn't believe it.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.369
I'm here to protect your brother,

12:09.428 --> 12:10.668
and I need to ask
him some questions.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.300
So, why don't you just shut up?

12:14.633 --> 12:16.442
Hold on! Hold on! Chill! Chill!

12:16.602 --> 12:17.876
Let's not let this get
out of hand again.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.041
I just had the carpet cleaned.

12:22.541 --> 12:23.713
Wow.

12:25.444 --> 12:26.821
You're really a Grimm.

12:27.012 --> 12:28.320
I'm, like, living like

12:28.414 --> 12:30.519
a piece of history right here, bro.

12:32.184 --> 12:34.721
Your brother, Rolf,
had a life insurance policy.

12:34.787 --> 12:36.858
Who was the beneficiary?
Don't answer him.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.869
No. I want to.
He's trying to help me.

12:40.226 --> 12:41.466
I got the money when Rolf died.

12:41.527 --> 12:42.972
Ugh, I need a drink.

12:43.295 --> 12:44.433
And if you die, who gets the money?

12:45.131 --> 12:47.441
Me. So, what?

12:47.533 --> 12:49.069
So, where were you the
night your brother died?

12:49.135 --> 12:50.170
Angelina!

12:50.236 --> 12:52.216
Whoa. Whoa. This is not
getting any better.

12:55.474 --> 12:56.851
The night Rolf died,

12:56.976 --> 12:58.751
I was in New Orleans

12:59.345 --> 13:00.722
visiting an old friend.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.418
Does your old friend have a name?

13:04.583 --> 13:05.721
Adam Halpin.

13:05.851 --> 13:08.855
Angelina. He's a butcher
in the French Quarter.

13:09.255 --> 13:10.757
His number is in the book.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.268
I'm going to get that drink now.

13:13.659 --> 13:15.900
I'm on it. I'm going
to top this off.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.299
Oh, come on. You cannot trust her.

13:20.499 --> 13:23.139
Well, uh, obviously,
it depends on the circumstances.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.838
But the point here is,

13:25.070 --> 13:27.346
she would never hurt her family.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.582
Do not let Hap leave this house.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.383
I won't. He'll be safe here.
I promise.

13:36.582 --> 13:37.720
Oh, man.

13:48.460 --> 13:49.461
Hey.

13:51.096 --> 13:53.508
Yeah, I want you to
run a plate for me.

14:53.025 --> 14:54.299
Thanks for being there for him.

14:55.027 --> 14:56.370
So, how is Adam?

14:58.864 --> 15:00.138
Oh, Adam.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.576
Uh, he's a lot of things.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.210
But he's not you.

15:07.006 --> 15:08.713
Tell me that you don't miss it.

15:09.008 --> 15:10.919
I don't miss being out of control.

15:10.976 --> 15:12.182
I'm in control.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.746
I could have killed that Grimm,
but I didn't.

15:13.812 --> 15:15.086
He could have killed you, too.

15:15.447 --> 15:17.518
Which would have made you sadder?

15:18.651 --> 15:19.891
Why are you here?

15:20.052 --> 15:21.827
I'm here to protect my brother.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.632
But now, there are other reasons.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.602
Ah!

15:32.898 --> 15:34.138
Come on.

15:35.034 --> 15:36.138
Come on.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.823
It's good to see you live a little.

15:49.381 --> 15:52.089
Do you remember the
time in the Cascades?

15:52.151 --> 15:53.653
We didn't go inside for a month.

15:53.719 --> 15:56.359
Admit it. You have
never felt so free.

15:57.056 --> 15:59.764
The call of the wild isn't
always such a good thing.

15:59.825 --> 16:01.566
Oh, what, you have regrets?

16:01.627 --> 16:04.073
Let's just say I'm glad
we didn't get caught.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.200
That would have just
added to the fun.

16:08.534 --> 16:11.572
All this restriction is, like,
its own compulsion. You know that?

16:12.771 --> 16:14.375
What do you say?

16:14.940 --> 16:16.180
What do you say?

16:16.275 --> 16:18.551
You up for a little nostalgia?

16:30.389 --> 16:31.459
What are you doing?

16:36.328 --> 16:37.500
Where are you going?

16:37.896 --> 16:38.966
Come on.

16:39.298 --> 16:41.369
It's a beautiful night
for a run in the woods.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.705
If you can still run.

18:20.732 --> 18:22.871
What have you got? WU:
Ran your motorcycle plate.

18:23.035 --> 18:24.946
Registered to an Angelina Lasser.

18:25.003 --> 18:26.983
553 North Bruin Vault Lane,
Troutdale.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.646
Couple of speeding tickets.
No priors.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.745
Anything else? No. Thanks a lot.

20:48.146 --> 20:50.558
24!? Pork. I've got your ribs here.

20:52.718 --> 20:55.426
My main man, Monroe.
Doing me a solid.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.394
Score.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.091
Coming!

21:00.959 --> 21:03.838
Man, I can't tell you how
glad I am to see you.

21:27.552 --> 21:30.328
No forced entry. Vic: took one to
the head three more to the chest.

21:30.389 --> 21:32.062
Not exactly a small target.

21:32.357 --> 21:33.529
No shell casings left behind.

21:33.592 --> 21:34.662
No neighbors reported any gunshots.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.940
I'd say it's a professional hit.

21:36.995 --> 21:38.906
Which, for Portland, frankly, is

21:38.964 --> 21:40.034
kind of bad-ass.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.907
Except, of course,
for the death part.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.013
I thought he was
supposed to be safe here.

21:44.069 --> 21:45.309
Well, so did I.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.908
But her bike is here.
So is his car.

21:48.507 --> 21:50.783
Didn't find any other bodies yet,
but, it's still early.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.722
Hap?

21:56.381 --> 21:58.622
No, that's my brother.
That is my brother.

21:58.717 --> 21:59.855
Let them through.

22:01.887 --> 22:04.595
Hap. No!

22:06.191 --> 22:07.670
What happened? He was shot.

22:09.194 --> 22:10.332
Four times.

22:10.829 --> 22:11.864
Where were you?

22:13.231 --> 22:15.438
We were just across the
street in the park.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.371
No, no, no, no.

22:18.370 --> 22:19.906
No, no, no.

22:26.111 --> 22:27.249
Do you see what I see?

22:29.414 --> 22:30.722
The blood on her clothes.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.156
Do you have any other
brothers and sisters?

22:37.422 --> 22:38.730
My parents are dead.

22:39.758 --> 22:41.738
Rolf and Hap were my only family.

22:42.427 --> 22:44.464
Any idea who might
have it in for them?

22:45.263 --> 22:46.401
No.

22:47.799 --> 22:49.642
Anybody threaten you?

22:49.968 --> 22:51.811
Not anyone that I'm worried about.

22:51.937 --> 22:55.111
And I guess you wouldn't want to spend
a little time in protective custody.

22:55.173 --> 22:57.847
Yeah, right. Me and a couple of cops,
holed up in a hotel room.

22:58.076 --> 23:00.215
Sounds like some good times to me.

23:00.278 --> 23:02.189
You know, you said
you went to the park.

23:02.247 --> 23:04.284
Is that how you got the
dirt on your clothes?

23:04.383 --> 23:05.384
This?

23:05.917 --> 23:08.397
Oh, this isn't dirt. This is blood.

23:09.154 --> 23:10.861
But you already know that,
don't you,

23:11.156 --> 23:12.396
Detective?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.800
Go ahead. Test it.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.374
Let me know what you get.

23:22.934 --> 23:25.938
Why did you leave him
alone in that house?

23:26.104 --> 23:28.175
Did she talk you into that? No.

23:28.774 --> 23:31.118
She didn't talk me into anything.

23:32.344 --> 23:33.846
Look, Monroe,

23:33.912 --> 23:35.914
I am your best friend right now.

23:36.181 --> 23:38.559
Look, if you don't talk to me...
It's my fault, okay?

23:39.017 --> 23:41.224
I left him alone.
It doesn't matter why.

23:41.286 --> 23:42.822
It matters if she
convinced you to leave

23:42.888 --> 23:44.333
and she has someone
else working with her.

23:44.389 --> 23:45.629
She wouldn't do that.
How do you know?

23:46.024 --> 23:47.560
Because he's her brother.

23:48.660 --> 23:50.435
We don't kill our own.

23:51.563 --> 23:53.634
You don't know her like I do, Nick.

23:54.366 --> 23:55.504
Yeah, well,
maybe that's your problem.

23:56.201 --> 23:58.272
Maybe you're a little too close.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.543
Hap was my friend!

24:01.273 --> 24:03.310
I would never have left
him alone if I thought...

24:03.542 --> 24:05.317
I honestly thought he'd be safe.

24:05.377 --> 24:06.481
Nick.

24:08.246 --> 24:09.589
Stay here.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.953
We ran blood tests on her clothes.

24:15.020 --> 24:16.397
And what have you got?

24:16.621 --> 24:17.964
Believe it or not, Bugs Bunny.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.631
They apparently had something to
do with the death of a rabbit.

24:21.693 --> 24:23.172
Oh, man.

24:33.705 --> 24:35.116
A rabbit?

24:36.174 --> 24:37.312
I, uh...

24:37.375 --> 24:38.854
Yeah, I lapsed.

24:39.044 --> 24:42.389
Maybe she is not the
right girl for you.

24:42.447 --> 24:43.448
Yup.

24:43.915 --> 24:45.519
I went over to her
house last night.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.188
Does she know that? No.

24:49.554 --> 24:50.555
Good.

24:51.857 --> 24:53.097
But there was somebody there.

24:54.392 --> 24:55.769
I didn't get a good look at him,

24:55.827 --> 24:57.363
and I interrupted
whatever he was up to.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.998
And he took off in a hurry.

24:59.064 --> 25:00.509
You think he was there
looking for her?

25:02.968 --> 25:04.811
Just watch yourself.

25:16.147 --> 25:18.923
What have you got?
Angelina's water glass.

25:18.984 --> 25:21.157
There were some unknown
prints on the propane valves

25:21.219 --> 25:22.357
at both her brothers' houses.

25:22.487 --> 25:24.899
I'm going to have the lab print
this and see if we get a match.

25:25.223 --> 25:27.430
I don't know if she had anything
to do with killing her brothers,

25:27.492 --> 25:28.869
but she's hiding something.

25:30.161 --> 25:32.903
My brothers are dead,
and they want to hang it on me.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.801
I hate cops.

25:35.133 --> 25:37.511
And you, how could you
even be friends with one?

25:37.569 --> 25:39.105
Who said we were friends?

25:39.170 --> 25:40.274
I hardly know the guy.

25:40.338 --> 25:42.841
Yeah, well, don't expect them to
bust their ass on who killed Hap.

25:42.908 --> 25:44.410
You do realize you could be next.

25:44.509 --> 25:47.353
Good. It will be the
last thing he ever tries.

25:47.412 --> 25:49.619
You don't even know who
you're looking for.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.352
Why do you got to act
like such a hard-ass?

25:51.416 --> 25:53.589
You liked my hard-ass
pretty good last night.

25:53.652 --> 25:55.495
Yeah, I did. And now, Hap is dead.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.890
He didn't hurt anybody.

25:57.956 --> 25:59.958
Okay? He didn't deserve
to die like that.

26:00.025 --> 26:01.868
Angelina, listen to me.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.374
It's not safe right now.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.240
Maybe you shouldn't
go home for awhile.

26:07.832 --> 26:08.833
Why?

26:10.702 --> 26:12.579
Nick told me someone was
in your house last night.

26:13.905 --> 26:16.215
That Grimm was in
my house last night?

26:16.474 --> 26:17.782
You're missing the point.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.352
I'll see you sometime.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.066
I was so worried.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.134
He's become very handsome.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.707
You're so brave.

26:38.930 --> 26:41.274
So, try to keep this on
Buddy for a couple of days.

26:41.333 --> 26:44.212
Try to keep it clean.
Don't let him run around in the mud.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.772
He's a guy, so I know
that's not going to be easy.

26:46.871 --> 26:48.544
You are good to go.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.950
Oh, Buddy.

26:50.475 --> 26:51.681
Good boy.

26:52.377 --> 26:54.118
A minor neighborhood emergency.

26:54.179 --> 26:55.920
Yeah, I can tell. Hello.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.656
Here you go.

26:59.718 --> 27:01.163
Come on, Buddy. Keep me posted.

27:01.586 --> 27:03.088
Thank you, Juliette.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.462
So, how did Buddy get
himself in trouble?

27:07.525 --> 27:11.701
He went after Eloise, that huge,
yellow cat a couple of doors down.

27:11.763 --> 27:13.242
How did Eloise come out of it?

27:13.298 --> 27:16.108
On top. Apparently, Buddy bit
off more than he could chew.

27:16.368 --> 27:17.506
The cat beat up the dog?

27:18.536 --> 27:20.482
Don't piss off a woman with claws.

27:26.845 --> 27:28.153
I'll try and remember that.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.320
How are you doing?
That looks better.

27:30.982 --> 27:34.395
You know, I'm just happy I
have a doctor in the house.

27:34.519 --> 27:36.089
Oh, that's sweet.

27:36.621 --> 27:38.396
Wait until you get my bill.

28:07.318 --> 28:08.661
Pig.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.832
Got the report back
on Angelina's prints.

28:14.459 --> 28:16.268
No match at either brother's house,

28:16.327 --> 28:18.068
but we got a match
on a bloody partial

28:18.129 --> 28:19.904
from a double murder two
years ago in Eugene.

28:20.665 --> 28:22.042
The vics were brothers.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.636
Lived next door to each other.

28:24.002 --> 28:25.106
Brothers?

28:25.170 --> 28:26.877
Murdered on the same night.

28:27.405 --> 28:29.043
Case is still open. No suspects.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.310
Until now.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.017
Don't know what those
boys ever did to her,

28:32.077 --> 28:34.455
but it gives a new meaning to
"You fight like a girl."

28:35.680 --> 28:37.091
Now, check this out.

28:40.218 --> 28:42.630
The vics were George
and Stanley Orson.

28:42.821 --> 28:44.391
Same name as our
arson investigator.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.093
Could be a coincidence,
but I found this.

28:51.196 --> 28:53.005
I think we have a family
feud going on here.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.101
Well, if it is, then we've
got an arson investigator

28:55.166 --> 28:56.577
investigating himself,

28:56.634 --> 28:59.114
which is why he found no
evidence at either crime scene.

28:59.170 --> 29:00.672
We better bring the
captain in on this one.

29:01.106 --> 29:03.211
You want to bring in Lieutenant
Orson for questioning?

29:03.274 --> 29:05.049
Yes. His brothers were
killed two years ago,

29:05.110 --> 29:06.987
and we believe Angelina
Lasser was responsible.

29:07.045 --> 29:09.252
We think he figured out she was
responsible for killing his brothers,

29:09.314 --> 29:10.349
and killed hers for payback.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.622
Oh, you think or you know?
He's an arson investigator.

29:12.684 --> 29:13.924
He knows better than anyone else

29:13.985 --> 29:15.521
how to make an explosion
look like an accident.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.123
We have an APB out on Angelina.

29:17.188 --> 29:18.292
How do you want us
to deal with Orson?

29:18.356 --> 29:20.358
Carefully. He's got a clean record.

29:21.526 --> 29:23.267
I'm not going to
protect a dirty cop.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.165
You make sure you're right.

29:25.330 --> 29:26.809
Yes, sir. All right.

29:43.248 --> 29:46.354
I know who killed Hap and Rolf.
It was a cop.

29:46.417 --> 29:48.124
A Bauerschwein. What?

29:48.219 --> 29:49.630
I picked up his stench
at the precinct,

29:49.687 --> 29:51.064
and then again at
my place last night.

29:53.191 --> 29:54.602
A pig? Uh-huh.

29:54.759 --> 29:56.397
Killed one of us?

29:56.761 --> 29:58.365
Are you sure? Oh, I'm sure.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.532
Who is it? I don't know,
but when I find out,

30:00.598 --> 30:02.771
he's going to pay. Angelina...

30:02.967 --> 30:04.139
Stay out of this.

30:04.269 --> 30:05.475
I owe it to Hap.

30:05.670 --> 30:07.013
And so do you.

30:07.438 --> 30:08.815
Hap's dead.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.018
There's nothing we
can do for him now.

30:13.878 --> 30:15.789
We should have been
here for him last night.

30:18.116 --> 30:22.531
I was hoping that you were going to
tear out a little piggy throat with me.

30:22.587 --> 30:24.589
I guess I'm still a little naive.

30:25.857 --> 30:27.097
You know what I hate the most?

30:27.759 --> 30:29.500
That I still love you.

30:53.384 --> 30:55.557
Burkhardt. MONROE: Angelina
just came by. She says she knows

30:55.620 --> 30:57.293
who killed her brothers.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.301
Says it was a Bauerschwein.

30:59.390 --> 31:00.892
A what? A pig.

31:01.059 --> 31:03.596
And I don't mean a cop,
but I do mean a cop.

31:03.928 --> 31:05.999
Does she know who? No. Do you?

31:07.832 --> 31:09.311
Look, I can't tel! you that.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.869
Well, you better protect his ass

31:11.002 --> 31:12.640
because she's out for blood.

31:18.243 --> 31:20.052
Lieutenant. Yeah.

31:20.645 --> 31:22.318
Mind if I have a word? Sure.

31:22.513 --> 31:24.959
I just wanted to let you know that
we are sending your case files

31:25.016 --> 31:27.587
on the Lasser arson to a Seattle
lab to get a second opinion.

31:27.685 --> 31:29.631
On what? Your belief
that both cases

31:29.687 --> 31:31.030
are accidental and unrelated.

31:31.155 --> 31:32.225
Why would you do that?

31:32.290 --> 31:33.894
It's just too much
of a coincidence.

31:33.992 --> 31:36.700
Two brothers. Both had
gas leaks a month apart.

31:36.794 --> 31:38.068
Doesn't that strike you
as a little strange?

31:38.363 --> 31:39.671
I didn't screw it up.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.836
An investigator tells
the story he wants told.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.379
I tell the truth. Yeah?

31:43.534 --> 31:44.774
And how about your two brothers?

31:44.836 --> 31:46.144
You want to tell me
the truth about them?

31:50.408 --> 31:51.614
Bauerschwein, right?

31:53.444 --> 31:54.980
I don't have a problem
with you, Detective.

31:56.981 --> 31:59.689
Our families have never been enemies.
You should know that.

32:01.886 --> 32:03.593
Let's not change it now.

32:18.136 --> 32:20.138
Monroe, it's Nick. Open up.

32:23.207 --> 32:25.244
Maybe I should just
get you your own key.

32:25.343 --> 32:26.754
Where is Angelina? I don't know.

32:31.983 --> 32:33.519
She is a murderer.

32:34.018 --> 32:35.861
She killed the brothers of a cop.

32:36.087 --> 32:38.033
And he killed hers.
I'm up to speed.

32:38.256 --> 32:39.997
Just tell me where she is.

32:40.091 --> 32:41.434
I'm going to tell
you what I told her.

32:41.592 --> 32:43.071
I'm staying out of it.

32:43.127 --> 32:46.597
This Blutbad-Bauerschwein
feud goes back centuries.

32:46.664 --> 32:49.440
We get blamed for every
Bauerschwein death.

32:49.500 --> 32:50.570
Even the suicides.

32:50.902 --> 32:51.937
And by the way,

32:52.070 --> 32:55.051
she is never going to let you
or anyone else arrest her.

32:55.206 --> 32:58.653
Right now, I'm just trying to
keep them from killing each other.

32:58.710 --> 32:59.780
Or somebody else.

33:00.278 --> 33:02.485
Good luck with that.
That's your job.

33:03.848 --> 33:05.293
You're still in love with her,
aren't you?

33:08.119 --> 33:09.223
No.

33:10.388 --> 33:11.492
I'm not.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.230
There was a time

33:13.424 --> 33:14.926
when I thought maybe,

33:15.526 --> 33:18.336
until I started waking up,
pulling a rabbit fur out of my teeth.

33:19.197 --> 33:21.108
I don't miss those days.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.275
There's no good
ending to this, Nick.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.171
I mean, I don't want her to die,

33:27.238 --> 33:30.219
but I don't want you to
try to arrest her, either.

33:30.975 --> 33:33.421
Frankly, I'd rather
she just get away

33:33.644 --> 33:35.624
so nobody else gets hurt.

33:36.414 --> 33:38.894
Come on, you know that's
not going to happen.

33:40.451 --> 33:42.055
Let me tell you something.

33:42.620 --> 33:44.361
I want this guy dead, too.

33:45.056 --> 33:46.296
You understand?

33:46.991 --> 33:50.097
And it has taken all my
self-control not to help her.

33:52.563 --> 33:56.477
So, you can either stick
around and have a glass of wine

33:56.534 --> 33:57.706
or you can leave.

34:40.945 --> 34:43.255
Excuse me. What are you doing?

34:44.348 --> 34:45.759
Just looking around.

34:46.016 --> 34:47.121
You got a reason to be here?

34:47.185 --> 34:48.755
I'm just looking for Officer Orson.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.458
He's not here. Who are you?

34:51.789 --> 34:53.268
I'm a friend.

34:53.658 --> 34:57.231
You wouldn't happen to have
his home address, would you?

34:57.295 --> 34:58.831
We don't give out that
kind of information.

34:59.030 --> 35:00.134
Hmm.

35:00.731 --> 35:01.801
You shouldn't be in here.

35:02.667 --> 35:04.010
What's your name?

35:04.102 --> 35:05.877
That's really not important.

35:06.003 --> 35:07.141
Yeah, it is.

35:17.582 --> 35:18.788
Where?

35:18.850 --> 35:20.488
Did they get her?

35:20.551 --> 35:21.996
You mean, she's still
in the building?

35:22.053 --> 35:23.532
Yeah, yeah. On our way.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.328
A woman was in Orson's
office looking for him.

35:25.423 --> 35:26.424
She attacked an officer.

35:26.491 --> 35:27.526
That had to be Angelina.

35:27.692 --> 35:29.694
She's got some balls
coming in here.

35:30.061 --> 35:31.631
How in the hell did
she know it was Orson?

35:31.696 --> 35:33.869
I don't know. But we better
find him before she does.

35:33.931 --> 35:35.308
Unless he's looking for her.

35:43.107 --> 35:44.643
Don't give me an
excuse to use this.

35:45.710 --> 35:47.314
You really need an excuse?

35:47.612 --> 35:49.250
This isn't between you and me.

35:49.380 --> 35:50.950
Then, what's with the shotgun?

35:51.082 --> 35:52.720
I didn't want to end
up on the dinner table

35:52.783 --> 35:54.524
with an apple stuffed in my mouth.

35:54.619 --> 35:57.361
Mind if I put my groceries down?

35:59.690 --> 36:00.691
Slowly.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.566
Slowly.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.034
I know what you're thinking,
Blutbad.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.477
"Can I get to him before
he pulls the trigger?"

36:11.536 --> 36:14.210
I know you're fast, but this thing
is filled with double-ought buck.

36:14.272 --> 36:15.842
You'll be pulling your
teeth off the back wall

36:15.907 --> 36:17.386
before you sink them into my neck.

36:17.475 --> 36:19.455
Do you really have to go there?

36:19.577 --> 36:21.352
Now, I know you're not going
to tell me where she is,

36:21.412 --> 36:22.584
so I'm not going to bother asking.

36:22.747 --> 36:24.522
But I'm going to
tell you something.

36:24.582 --> 36:26.152
This ends with me and her.

36:28.119 --> 36:29.962
You killed my friend.

36:30.988 --> 36:32.695
I'm supposed to be okay with that?

36:32.757 --> 36:35.328
Your friend was part
of an old world order.

36:35.493 --> 36:36.904
Hap wasn't like that.

36:36.961 --> 36:38.599
Neither were my brothers.

36:38.663 --> 36:41.109
And she killed them.
So, I killed hers.

36:41.399 --> 36:42.969
We're not the same
Bauerschwein we used to be.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.411
You just give her the message.

36:45.970 --> 36:47.278
We're even.

36:47.505 --> 36:49.007
I can tell her,
but she ain't going to listen.

36:49.073 --> 36:51.019
She's old-fashioned that way.

36:51.075 --> 36:52.554
Change is never easy.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.786
But you can't say I didn't try.

37:03.187 --> 37:04.723
Hey. Hold up.

37:04.789 --> 37:07.269
I just got a call from the officer
checking on Angelina's house.

37:07.325 --> 37:09.271
What, you get her? No,
but somebody torched her house.

37:09.327 --> 37:10.704
Any bodies? We don't know.

37:10.761 --> 37:13.264
Fire department is still mopping up.
We can't get in yet.

37:13.331 --> 37:15.470
You take Angelina's.
I'll take Orson's. Yeah.

37:23.007 --> 37:24.384
Lieutenant Orson?

37:24.709 --> 37:26.416
It's Detective Burkhardt.

37:30.615 --> 37:32.390
Orson, it's Nick. I'm coming in.

38:52.096 --> 38:53.905
Relax, relax It's just me.

38:56.133 --> 38:57.271
What the hell are you doing?

38:57.868 --> 38:58.869
Mud bath.

39:00.104 --> 39:01.447
Yeah, I got that.

39:01.872 --> 39:05.376
It's a Bauerschwein thing It soothes
the skin, it helps me think.

39:05.443 --> 39:06.547
So, what are you thinking?

39:06.711 --> 39:08.884
You know what I was thinking?
When you stopped me in the stairwell

39:08.946 --> 39:11.153
and you figured out
what I really was,

39:11.215 --> 39:12.717
I was a little
freaked out at first.

39:12.783 --> 39:14.558
And then, I realized
maybe you being a Grimm,

39:14.618 --> 39:15.756
maybe that's not such a bad thing.

39:15.820 --> 39:17.265
We're kind of on the same side.

39:17.321 --> 39:18.664
I don't think so.

39:18.923 --> 39:20.732
Angelina Lasser is a monster.

39:20.791 --> 39:22.600
You go after monsters, so do I.

39:22.660 --> 39:23.764
You killed two people!

39:23.828 --> 39:25.364
Blutbaden are not people.

39:25.429 --> 39:27.602
Rolf was an animal,
just like his sister.

39:27.665 --> 39:28.735
And Hap?

39:29.433 --> 39:32.243
Do you know why she
killed my brothers?

39:32.670 --> 39:34.547
That doesn't matter. For fun.

39:35.172 --> 39:36.242
For sport.

39:36.307 --> 39:38.583
It was just something to
do on a Saturday night.

39:38.642 --> 39:39.916
It's over.

39:41.479 --> 39:43.254
Put on some clothes.

39:47.485 --> 39:49.522
My brothers worked
their entire lives

39:49.587 --> 39:51.328
to put a crummy roof
over their heads.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.493
And then...

39:53.557 --> 39:56.436
This is the first time one of
us has gone after one of them.

39:56.494 --> 39:58.906
The huff and puff days are over.

39:58.963 --> 40:02.433
Now, Burkhardt, whatever else we are,
we are both cops.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.036
And we ought to be
working together.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.547
I'm not working with you.
I am putting you under arrest.

40:06.637 --> 40:08.583
This is not about the law,
do you understand?

40:08.639 --> 40:10.710
This is never going
to be about the law.

40:10.775 --> 40:12.186
How are you going to
teach a wild animal...

40:16.614 --> 40:18.321
What are you doing? She's here.

40:24.889 --> 40:26.163
Get off him!

40:33.264 --> 40:34.402
Get off him!

40:35.032 --> 40:36.511
You were good to Hap.

40:36.567 --> 40:38.604
So, I'm going to
give you a free pass.

40:50.147 --> 40:51.421
Now, you're going '10 Pa}!

40:57.321 --> 40:58.527
No!

40:58.589 --> 40:59.727
No!

41:25.249 --> 41:28.355
Sometimes, being a cop gets in
the way of what you have to do.

41:46.937 --> 41:49.281
Yeah. He's in custody,
and she's been shot.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.320
Where is she?
We're still looking for her.

41:51.375 --> 41:52.979
You'll never find her.

41:53.878 --> 41:56.051
Yeah. But you might.

41:57.481 --> 41:58.824
Don't push it.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
