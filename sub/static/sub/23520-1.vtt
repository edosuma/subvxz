01:51.501 --> 01:52.710
John Saxby!

02:12.917 --> 02:15.543
Dad's been asking for you.
Did you look in on him?

02:17.542 --> 02:19.543
That heifer needs looking at, he said.

02:24.501 --> 02:26.210
You kept us up half the night, lad.

02:35.584 --> 02:37.879
And if you think
I'm cleaning your sick up again

02:37.959 --> 02:39.543
you've got another thing coming.

04:27.792 --> 04:28.879
It's alright.

04:28.959 --> 04:31.712
It's alright, lass. It's just me.

04:31.792 --> 04:32.877
Shh, shh.

04:33.876 --> 04:36.837
Shh, it's alright, lass.

04:36.917 --> 04:38.879
That's it, there, come on.

04:38.959 --> 04:40.793
Come on.

04:41.792 --> 04:42.877
It's alright.

04:43.876 --> 04:44.918
That's it.

04:48.959 --> 04:50.835
It's just your Johnny boy.

04:51.917 --> 04:52.918
Eh?

04:55.334 --> 04:56.835
Not be long now.

04:59.292 --> 05:01.793
A little fat calf. That's what we want, eh?

05:16.459 --> 05:18.918
You're gonna wait
until Johnny boy's back, aren't you?

05:20.917 --> 05:21.918
Good lass.

05:23.792 --> 05:25.793
Come on, that's it.

05:51.792 --> 05:53.796
80 bid. One? 81. Two? 82.

06:04.126 --> 06:06.046
89.50.

06:06.126 --> 06:09.085
M. Saxby & Son now. Good cow here, 700kg.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.087
£100 bid? Underbid. Call it 99.50.

06:26.167 --> 06:28.335
Hauxwell.

08:12.084 --> 08:14.252
Hold up, mate. Alright?

08:15.167 --> 08:18.210
How's you? Wanna get a pint or summat?

08:19.709 --> 08:20.712
No.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.671
Right. I just...
You know, it were fun an' that.

08:23.751 --> 08:25.212
- I thought we might...
- We?

08:25.292 --> 08:28.002
- Yeah.
- No.

08:51.251 --> 08:54.127
Where've you been? Dad had to see to her.

09:08.709 --> 09:10.585
It were arse about tit.

09:12.626 --> 09:13.710
Bull calf an' all.

09:15.626 --> 09:17.293
You could've saved that.

09:26.459 --> 09:28.337
- I'll get the vet.
- No.

09:28.417 --> 09:30.793
Don't talk wet. Just get on with it.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.168
Shoulders on it.

10:01.209 --> 10:04.129
- What did you draw for that cull cow?
- £700.

10:04.209 --> 10:06.046
Right.

10:06.126 --> 10:08.127
Maybe next time you'll frame yourself.

10:08.334 --> 10:12.046
I could have been quicker,
hobbling around on these damn things.

10:12.126 --> 10:14.171
- Thank God that lad's on his way.
- Yeah, I could've managed.

10:14.251 --> 10:16.629
- I have done so far.
- Yeah, course you have.

10:16.709 --> 10:19.335
Let's all give you
a round of applause, shall we?

11:17.251 --> 11:19.087
Is there any afters?

11:19.167 --> 11:21.252
Might be a tin of fruit cocktail
you can have.

11:24.126 --> 11:26.754
Go easy on that.
I want that lad picking up in good time.

11:26.834 --> 11:29.337
- Why do I have to go?
- Oh, wind your neck in.

11:29.417 --> 11:32.171
- I didn't even want him here, did I?
- He were the only bugger to apply.

11:32.251 --> 11:34.629
Let's at least get him here
in one piece, shall we?

11:34.709 --> 11:36.754
Whatever. It's always down to muggins here.

11:36.834 --> 11:40.710
Oh, enough mardy arse.
You're getting on my wick.

11:51.751 --> 11:53.171
Fuck's sake.

11:59.417 --> 12:01.212
Do they call thee Georgie or summat?

12:01.292 --> 12:03.377
- Gheorghe.
- Whatever. Get in.

12:21.459 --> 12:24.418
That'll be as much use
as a chocolate fireguard up here.

13:02.459 --> 13:07.335
It's a bit of a midden, like.
That thing unfolds out into like a bed thing.

13:08.084 --> 13:11.168
You can switch that on, but it's
a gas bottle, mind, so don't go mad wi' it.

13:12.501 --> 13:13.543
There's a bog in there.

13:16.167 --> 13:17.796
This looks OK.

13:17.876 --> 13:20.793
- You half-Paki or summat?
- Pardon?

13:23.167 --> 13:25.835
Er, no, I am from Romania.

13:26.959 --> 13:29.460
- Gypsy.
- Please don't call me that.

13:32.542 --> 13:35.171
That door needs a shove.
Don't always close proper.

13:35.251 --> 13:38.585
Me Nan said to say come over and she'll
make you a bap and a brew when you're set.

13:48.042 --> 13:49.754
I told you, didn't I?

13:49.834 --> 13:53.460
Shitehole. Bet you wish
you'd stayed in Romania.

14:22.834 --> 14:26.504
I hate train journeys, me.
I always end up gipping my guts up.

14:26.584 --> 14:28.293
When were you last on a train?

14:29.001 --> 14:30.418
I'm just saying.

14:32.084 --> 14:35.085
It's 100 odd Swaledale
crossed blackface gimmers.

14:35.626 --> 14:37.002
Do you understand me?

14:38.917 --> 14:40.796
And what about milk?

14:40.876 --> 14:43.337
Just got a few beef cattle,
nowt much to speak of.

14:43.417 --> 14:46.918
No, sorry, the sheep. Do you make cheese?

14:48.542 --> 14:51.627
It's very good cheese, and good money.

14:52.251 --> 14:54.712
Your English is good.

14:54.792 --> 14:56.835
My mother teaches English back in Romania.

14:57.542 --> 14:58.460
Fancy.

15:00.251 --> 15:02.212
We muddle through on our own most of t' time

15:02.292 --> 15:05.210
but wi' lambing and that
our lad needs extra help.

15:06.751 --> 15:08.043
It's perfect for me.

15:09.334 --> 15:10.877
You got somewhere to go after?

15:11.959 --> 15:15.004
Good, cos we just need someone
for the week, lad.

15:15.084 --> 15:17.918
We're not running a charity
for waifs and strays, like.

15:22.042 --> 15:24.962
- Have you pressed my collared shirt, Nan?
- It's hung up in your wardrobe.

15:25.042 --> 15:27.879
If you would but try looking further
than your own backside.

15:27.959 --> 15:30.837
Right. Got any clean socks an' all?

15:30.917 --> 15:32.960
Go easy on the sauce tonight, lad.

15:33.626 --> 15:36.085
I need you to take me
up to Top Fell early tomorrow

15:36.876 --> 15:37.921
show them ewes to this one.

15:38.001 --> 15:39.918
They'll be ripe to drop.

15:40.959 --> 15:42.879
- Do you hear me?
- Aye, I've heard you.

15:42.959 --> 15:44.837
What are you two in cahoots about?

15:44.917 --> 15:47.837
- Nowt. Ta.
- Oi, ignorant!

15:47.917 --> 15:49.796
Why don't you ask him if he fancies a pint?

15:49.876 --> 15:51.837
No, please, it's OK.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.837
I've been travelling a long time.

15:53.917 --> 15:56.918
It's best I will just go to sleep tonight.

15:57.292 --> 16:00.043
Make sure the immersion's off an' all.

17:10.001 --> 17:12.460
- Johnny?
- Alright?

17:13.501 --> 17:15.792
Er, get us a pint in, Han.
I'll just be a sec.

17:17.291 --> 17:19.127
- What's up wi' you?
- Nowt.

17:19.251 --> 17:22.460
Well, do you wanna tell your face?

17:23.501 --> 17:26.792
- Is your dad any better?
- No, he's getting on wi' it, you know.

17:26.916 --> 17:29.418
- It must be tough for yous.
- It's a' right.

17:30.292 --> 17:33.877
I thought once you lot escaped to your fancy
colleges and that, you'd never come back.

17:34.001 --> 17:36.710
It's reading week, isn't it?
You know what me mam's like.

17:37.251 --> 17:40.585
Came up with a couple of my uni mates.
Makes it bearable.

17:40.709 --> 17:42.793
Brought 'em to gawp and laugh at the natives?

17:42.917 --> 17:44.210
Get over yourself.

17:44.334 --> 17:46.752
You're not that interesting
as a local tourist attraction.

17:49.959 --> 17:51.335
Got a spare one of them or what?

17:52.709 --> 17:55.127
Come on, you tight wad.
I'm just a poor student.

17:56.334 --> 17:57.335
Come on.

18:09.251 --> 18:10.252
Ta.

18:12.126 --> 18:15.043
We should have a night out.
Bradford or somewhere?

18:15.167 --> 18:18.085
- What?
- That's what I love about folk like you.

18:18.209 --> 18:20.377
You fuck off to your posh colleges an' that

18:20.501 --> 18:23.585
and swan back here on your holidays,
thinking you know it all.

18:25.376 --> 18:27.002
Some of us just have to get on wi' it, like.

18:27.126 --> 18:29.585
- Alright. It's just a night out.
- Aye, to you.

18:29.667 --> 18:31.752
I'll tell me cows they can go
without their teas shall I

18:31.834 --> 18:33.752
cos I'm off gallivanting around Bradford?

18:33.876 --> 18:36.918
You'd like my uni mates. They're a laugh.

18:37.042 --> 18:38.460
One of them's a real laugh.

18:39.584 --> 18:41.002
What do you mean by that?

18:41.126 --> 18:43.127
He's nice. You'd like him. He's funny.

18:43.251 --> 18:44.793
Remember? Like you used to be.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.335
Before I had to join the real world.

18:49.959 --> 18:51.168
You know what? Forget it.

18:51.917 --> 18:54.585
You can be a right pain in the arse,
John Saxby.

18:54.709 --> 18:56.377
And not in a good way.

18:56.501 --> 18:58.127
Yeah, whatever.

18:59.042 --> 19:00.668
Enjoy your holidays.

19:29.792 --> 19:32.543
Wake up, we're here. Come on, we're here now.

19:32.667 --> 19:35.210
Wake up. Hey, will you get out of my cab?

19:40.001 --> 19:41.710
Will you stop fucking around?

19:43.209 --> 19:46.418
Come on, shift yourself. Will you wake up?

19:47.376 --> 19:48.877
Fucking hell!

19:54.959 --> 19:56.210
Bastard.

22:08.834 --> 22:11.793
Thought I told you I wanted
to get up to Top Fell early.

22:12.376 --> 22:14.585
Aye, well, I can take you now.
I'll just pick the truck up.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.627
You're too late. He took me.

22:18.542 --> 22:19.835
Them ewes have started.

22:19.959 --> 22:22.418
And what about that boundary wall being down?

22:23.542 --> 22:27.877
Right. You can lamb up on t' fell,
rebuild that wall while you're at it.

22:28.001 --> 22:30.877
- Can't we bring 'em down?
- No, you can't.

22:31.001 --> 22:32.377
You'll learn, lad.

22:32.501 --> 22:34.668
You should've bothered fixin'
t' fencing in t' back paddock

22:34.792 --> 22:37.335
when I asked you months back.

22:37.459 --> 22:40.293
Might stop you getting kaylied
on a nightly basis an' all.

22:40.376 --> 22:42.418
I have a few pints on a night-time. So what?

22:42.542 --> 22:44.252
What else am I meant to do
apart from work, like?

22:44.376 --> 22:45.960
There's fuck all else going on
round here, is there?

22:46.084 --> 22:48.418
I'd keep a lid on it if I were you.

22:48.542 --> 22:50.377
What's wrong with just wanting
a night out somewhere?

22:50.501 --> 22:52.629
- Bradford or somewhere, I don't know.
- Don't talk daft.

22:52.709 --> 22:54.171
I'm not you, you know.

22:54.251 --> 22:55.962
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

22:56.042 --> 22:59.337
No one gives a flying fuck what I think.
I'm just here to slog me guts out

22:59.417 --> 23:01.418
- cos you're fucking fucked.
- I'm what?

23:02.709 --> 23:04.002
Nowt. Forget it.

23:04.126 --> 23:06.543
Oh, no, you've clearly got
summat you wanna say.

23:07.459 --> 23:08.335
Ow!

23:10.501 --> 23:12.543
Jesus wept! I'm sick of this.

23:13.876 --> 23:15.293
You, get on wi' it.

23:15.792 --> 23:17.335
- You, come with me.
- What?

23:17.459 --> 23:18.585
I said out!

24:11.959 --> 24:14.043
Got a problem or summat?

24:14.167 --> 24:16.585
No, I don't have any problems.

24:17.376 --> 24:18.627
Good.

24:19.792 --> 24:20.793
Gypo.

24:20.917 --> 24:23.710
- You forgot your big coat.
- I'm not taking it.

24:23.834 --> 24:26.710
Well, don't come crying to me
when you freeze your arse off.

24:27.417 --> 24:29.710
- I won't.
- At least have these.

24:33.709 --> 24:35.668
And don't go mental on that damn bike.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.252
Stinks of piss.

25:56.292 --> 25:58.335
You doing any work today, gypsy, or what?

26:58.167 --> 26:59.168
It will be a runt.

27:28.917 --> 27:30.627
Suit yourself.

29:57.209 --> 29:59.085
Get your arse into gear, gypo.

30:04.667 --> 30:06.210
Do not call me that.

30:07.751 --> 30:09.210
I know what you're doing.

30:09.834 --> 30:12.460
I will fuck with you.

30:13.751 --> 30:15.418
Do we understand each other?

30:17.292 --> 30:18.293
Good.

30:19.376 --> 30:21.918
Now we can get on with the work.

30:22.042 --> 30:23.043
Yes?

30:25.834 --> 30:26.835
Yeah.

30:55.834 --> 30:57.668
A vet should see this.

31:00.626 --> 31:01.793
Do you have antiseptic?

31:19.251 --> 31:21.085
Fuck! Fuck!

31:26.959 --> 31:29.710
If you leave it,
it will get infected with disease.

31:47.542 --> 31:48.960
It's just a graze.

31:51.084 --> 31:52.585
It will sting, that's all.

36:25.709 --> 36:26.835
What?

36:27.501 --> 36:28.918
I'm starving, me.

37:35.001 --> 37:36.085
It's beautiful here.

37:45.834 --> 37:48.293
When I was a kid, I thought
I would never leave my farm.

37:51.417 --> 37:53.335
It's beautiful here, but lonely, no?

39:09.751 --> 39:11.002
Night.

42:17.626 --> 42:18.668
What?

42:19.376 --> 42:20.585
Freak.

42:23.042 --> 42:25.002
- Faggot.
- Fuck off.

42:25.626 --> 42:26.835
Faggot.

47:27.167 --> 47:30.210
In my country, spring is the most beautiful.

47:31.292 --> 47:32.543
The sun.

47:33.501 --> 47:34.752
The flowers.

47:36.251 --> 47:37.543
The smells.

47:43.876 --> 47:48.752
Mam loved it when spring came.
'Winter's too long up here, ' she'd say.

47:50.042 --> 47:51.043
Your mother?

47:56.501 --> 47:58.752
Don't think she were very happy.

47:58.876 --> 48:00.752
They called her Annie.

48:00.876 --> 48:03.668
Wanted to be a hairdresser or summat
in a town down south.

48:06.709 --> 48:08.543
Must have been hard.

48:11.584 --> 48:13.835
I don't really remember.

48:13.959 --> 48:17.377
She left and... We just got on with it, so...

49:18.292 --> 49:19.918
Where are you going?

51:03.917 --> 51:06.752
Drop your stuff off
and we can sort them hoggs out, yeah?

52:06.417 --> 52:08.377
That an ulcer?

52:11.292 --> 52:15.710
<i>On Friday, it was 50 years to the day
since the funeral of Winston Churchill...</i>

52:32.209 --> 52:34.627
- What's wrong wi' you?
- Nowt.

52:38.126 --> 52:40.627
<i>The mill provides the wool
for ceremonial uniforms</i>

52:40.751 --> 52:42.710
<i>in the Ministry of Defence...</i>

52:48.126 --> 52:50.085
I can do that for you, Nan.

52:53.751 --> 52:55.668
- Are you sickening for summat?
- No.

53:05.292 --> 53:06.502
Night.

53:14.876 --> 53:16.502
Shouldn't we wait?

53:19.126 --> 53:20.752
No, let's go to bed.

53:22.542 --> 53:24.418
- Do you mean here?
- Aye.

53:26.084 --> 53:27.293
No.

53:28.709 --> 53:32.460
- I think we should stay in the caravan.
- We can stay here.

53:40.334 --> 53:41.960
See you in the caravan.

55:12.251 --> 55:14.502
- What are you two up to?
- Muck spreading.

55:20.459 --> 55:22.004
What about this mess?

57:22.709 --> 57:25.543
Here I am, love. You're alright.

57:28.417 --> 57:29.627
I'm here, love.

57:30.917 --> 57:32.585
I'm here, love.

58:19.001 --> 58:20.002
Yeah?

58:43.001 --> 58:46.460
Two strapping lads here for you, Mrs Saxby.

58:55.292 --> 58:56.502
I'll go get some tea.

59:04.959 --> 59:08.046
Nay, don't go sitting on the bed
all blathered up.

59:08.126 --> 59:10.543
It's someone's job to wash them sheets.

59:28.792 --> 59:30.502
Doctor's just been round.

59:31.834 --> 59:34.377
Young coloured lass. Nice little thing.

59:35.126 --> 59:38.418
Said a second stroke's quite common
after what Dad's been through.

59:39.209 --> 59:41.252
Said it could be to do with the stress.

59:52.626 --> 59:54.543
Have you had your teas?

59:56.084 --> 59:57.877
I should've left you summat out.

59:58.001 --> 59:59.960
I'm not fussed.

01:00:00.084 --> 01:00:01.793
Nay, damn it, lad.

01:00:01.917 --> 01:00:05.960
It's all on your shoulders now.
You can't go getting poorly an' all.

01:00:14.959 --> 01:00:18.293
- That finished with?
- Yeah. Sorry, miss.

01:00:18.417 --> 01:00:19.710
Sorry.

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:30.752
How is he?

01:00:33.917 --> 01:00:36.252
Have you seen the doctor?

01:00:37.417 --> 01:00:39.543
Don't you want to speak to the doctor?

01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:51.918
John?

01:00:54.334 --> 01:00:56.960
What if they say summat I don't wanna hear?

01:02:17.417 --> 01:02:20.335
- I should be getting back.
- Aye.

01:02:21.584 --> 01:02:23.293
Cows will need their teas, like.

01:02:28.792 --> 01:02:30.502
Go on. I'll let you know.

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:01.918
Get out the way, you useless piece of shite.

01:03:02.042 --> 01:03:04.043
Hey, hey, it's not her fault.

01:05:14.876 --> 01:05:16.835
You had a funny do, love.

01:05:23.542 --> 01:05:25.543
Oh, you gave us such a fright,
you daft beggar.

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:31.168
You'd do owt to get out
of the mucking-out, wunt you?

01:05:40.917 --> 01:05:42.252
Hello?

01:05:43.376 --> 01:05:44.502
Alright, Nan.

01:05:46.417 --> 01:05:47.418
Yeah.

01:05:49.792 --> 01:05:50.752
OK.

01:05:52.292 --> 01:05:53.293
Right.

01:05:54.584 --> 01:05:55.585
Right.

01:05:58.542 --> 01:05:59.543
Bye.

01:06:10.584 --> 01:06:14.793
I was thinking, I could stay a little longer.

01:06:15.917 --> 01:06:17.752
Until Martin is better.

01:06:19.834 --> 01:06:21.502
Just to help out.

01:06:25.626 --> 01:06:26.793
No?

01:06:55.042 --> 01:06:56.668
How do you say 'farm'?

01:06:58.042 --> 01:06:59.377
<i>Ferma.</i>

01:07:01.709 --> 01:07:04.043
How do you say 'sheep'?

01:07:04.167 --> 01:07:05.460
<i>Oaie.</i>

01:07:07.209 --> 01:07:08.460
How do you say...

01:07:10.792 --> 01:07:12.002
...cock?

01:07:16.876 --> 01:07:18.127
Cock.

01:07:52.626 --> 01:07:54.252
When you've finished fannying with that

01:07:54.334 --> 01:07:56.710
I need your help to get
them ewes down before night.

01:08:03.792 --> 01:08:08.127
- I'll be two minutes.
- Yeah. I'll wait for you.

01:09:54.084 --> 01:09:57.754
Just bobbed back to get your dad
some clean jim-jams and that.

01:09:57.834 --> 01:09:59.793
You done the beasts?

01:10:02.417 --> 01:10:04.835
- How is he?
- Getting on with it.

01:10:06.667 --> 01:10:09.293
Do you wanna tell me
what that muck is in my best tea towel?

01:10:09.417 --> 01:10:13.835
Cheese. Gheorghe made it.
He milked one of the sheep, like.

01:10:14.084 --> 01:10:16.668
- Have you tried it?
- No, ta.

01:10:17.584 --> 01:10:21.918
- I see you helped yourself to breakfast.
- Aye. Gheorghe did eggs and that.

01:10:22.042 --> 01:10:23.252
Did he?

01:10:24.417 --> 01:10:26.377
He's a good lad.

01:10:28.292 --> 01:10:30.085
He's gonna stay on for a bit.

01:10:30.209 --> 01:10:32.168
Just so as you're clear, he's here to work.

01:10:32.292 --> 01:10:33.502
Yeah, I know.

01:10:34.376 --> 01:10:37.752
- Right. Just so you're clear.
- I am.

01:10:37.876 --> 01:10:40.418
He's gonna fill in
till our dad's back to normal.

01:10:41.126 --> 01:10:45.085
- How do you mean?
- Till he's up and about, like.

01:10:45.876 --> 01:10:48.960
Your dad's not gonna get any better, John.

01:10:49.917 --> 01:10:51.918
You don't know that. He might.

01:10:52.042 --> 01:10:56.252
We were this close to losing him.
Got to face facts, lad.

01:11:12.626 --> 01:11:15.252
I'm off to t' pub. You coming?

01:11:41.042 --> 01:11:43.668
Did you come here
on your own, then, to England?

01:11:43.792 --> 01:11:45.002
Yeah.

01:11:47.251 --> 01:11:49.835
There was someone once but...

01:11:51.376 --> 01:11:52.627
Right.

01:11:58.001 --> 01:11:59.502
Will you go back?

01:12:02.376 --> 01:12:04.168
My country is dead.

01:12:06.584 --> 01:12:09.752
You can't throw a rock in most towns
without hitting an old lady

01:12:09.876 --> 01:12:12.210
crying for her children who have gone.

01:12:16.292 --> 01:12:17.835
I was thinking...

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:23.960
I'm not sure what's gonna happen now
with our dad the way he is, but...

01:12:24.084 --> 01:12:27.085
how would it be if you stayed on, like?

01:12:28.501 --> 01:12:30.460
- I've told you, I can stay.
- Yeah.

01:12:32.126 --> 01:12:35.877
I guess I just... mean for longer.

01:12:36.959 --> 01:12:39.043
It'd be sweet, right?

01:12:44.334 --> 01:12:46.710
And how would we work on the farm?

01:12:47.626 --> 01:12:49.252
How do you mean?

01:12:49.626 --> 01:12:55.043
Well, it can't go on like it has.
You must see that, no?

01:12:56.167 --> 01:13:00.002
- What's the farm got to do with you?
- If I stayed, a lot.

01:13:01.751 --> 01:13:03.710
I've been through this before.

01:13:04.334 --> 01:13:08.043
On my farm. I can't go through that again.

01:13:10.626 --> 01:13:13.627
It will not survive, believe me.

01:13:17.626 --> 01:13:20.252
- Have you talked to Martin and Deirdre?
- They'll be fine.

01:13:20.376 --> 01:13:21.835
- Will they?
- Yeah.

01:13:23.834 --> 01:13:26.085
And how will you be?

01:13:27.959 --> 01:13:30.085
How do you mean?

01:13:30.209 --> 01:13:33.668
You. Us.

01:13:33.959 --> 01:13:36.002
It's not like I'm asking you
to get wed or anything.

01:13:36.126 --> 01:13:39.085
No, but you're asking me
to stay here with you.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:44.085
- Do you understand me?
- Alright!

01:13:45.042 --> 01:13:46.335
I've heard you.

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:53.046
We'll have two more of these
when you're ready

01:13:53.126 --> 01:13:54.752
and a couple of Sambuca shots.

01:14:01.542 --> 01:14:03.085
I think I've had enough.

01:14:20.292 --> 01:14:23.502
- Want another?
- I haven't finished that one yet.

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:25.627
Well, sup up, then.

01:16:09.501 --> 01:16:12.543
- Please don't do that.
- Pleez don do zat.

01:16:19.959 --> 01:16:23.210
Hey! Get the fuck out of my pub,
you dirty little bastard,

01:16:23.334 --> 01:16:25.335
or am I calling t' pigs?

01:16:44.667 --> 01:16:46.877
Did you hear what I said?

01:17:46.626 --> 01:17:48.543
- What are you doing?
- Fuck you!

01:17:49.126 --> 01:17:50.127
Hey!

01:18:38.001 --> 01:18:39.460
He left.

01:18:39.917 --> 01:18:42.252
I'm guessing you had summat to do with it.

01:18:44.334 --> 01:18:46.752
So what are we gonna do now, clever clogs?

01:18:54.292 --> 01:18:55.335
We'll manage.

01:20:36.084 --> 01:20:38.835
Mistle needs doing.

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:40.043
I know.

01:20:43.626 --> 01:20:44.710
Pissing...

01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:46.710
...do it!

01:21:55.042 --> 01:21:56.210
You...

01:21:59.792 --> 01:22:01.377
...done beasts?

01:22:04.917 --> 01:22:06.377
Off out?

01:22:08.459 --> 01:22:09.877
Them...

01:22:10.001 --> 01:22:11.002
Mm...

01:22:13.334 --> 01:22:14.960
Them lambs.

01:22:19.167 --> 01:22:20.752
Yeah, I know.

01:22:23.917 --> 01:22:26.502
Check 'em before bed.

01:22:27.792 --> 01:22:28.793
Alright.

01:25:21.167 --> 01:25:23.877
- I can manage.
- Don't talk daft, lad.

01:25:24.001 --> 01:25:25.502
I've said I can do it.

01:26:02.167 --> 01:26:03.752
Thank you.

01:26:44.501 --> 01:26:45.710
Dad's in bed.

01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:49.877
- You should get some rest, lad.
- I'm fine. I can cope.

01:26:50.001 --> 01:26:52.752
You mean, like your dad did?

01:27:43.542 --> 01:27:44.710
You...

01:27:47.292 --> 01:27:48.377
...fenced...

01:27:50.001 --> 01:27:51.418
...all back paddock.

01:28:09.501 --> 01:28:10.502
I'm sorry.

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:19.960
I can't do what you want me to.

01:28:23.167 --> 01:28:27.335
I can make this work but...
the way that I want to do it, not you.

01:28:32.542 --> 01:28:34.210
I've got to go get him.

01:28:36.917 --> 01:28:39.168
I want to go and get him.

01:28:39.292 --> 01:28:40.710
Me...

01:28:42.292 --> 01:28:43.460
T' farm.

01:28:44.792 --> 01:28:47.002
- This.
- I've caught up.

01:28:48.042 --> 01:28:50.127
Nan can do t' beasts.

01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:53.043
I'm not going for good.

01:28:54.834 --> 01:28:58.960
Dad, listen to me. I am coming back.

01:29:00.584 --> 01:29:03.252
But I'm coming back
and I want it to be different.

01:29:09.709 --> 01:29:11.543
Make you happy?

01:29:14.251 --> 01:29:16.502
Yeah, I think it could.

01:29:26.584 --> 01:29:28.877
You did... good...

01:29:32.917 --> 01:29:35.710
...on t' paddock, lad.

01:30:04.001 --> 01:30:07.293
- You doing a moonlight flit?
- I was coming to see you.

01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:10.127
Course you were.

01:30:24.292 --> 01:30:25.918
You forgetting summat?

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:12.585
Do you know where Gheorghe is?

01:34:32.959 --> 01:34:34.710
I must've fallen asleep.

01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:44.252
I tried to stay awake,
but I was dead tired, like.

01:34:45.167 --> 01:34:47.627
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.

01:34:47.751 --> 01:34:50.043
I'm at my work.

01:34:50.167 --> 01:34:51.668
Yeah.

01:34:54.501 --> 01:34:56.127
What do you want?

01:35:02.751 --> 01:35:04.835
What is it?

01:35:07.501 --> 01:35:09.418
I got that antiseptic for the sheep.

01:35:09.542 --> 01:35:12.377
- That's good.
- Aye.

01:35:13.251 --> 01:35:16.335
- She's doing a lot better.
- Good.

01:35:17.417 --> 01:35:22.168
- I thought you'd be pleased.
- I'm pleased you're helping the sheep.

01:35:33.751 --> 01:35:36.085
Why did you just leave?

01:35:46.251 --> 01:35:48.296
You shouldn't have come. I'm not the answer.

01:35:48.376 --> 01:35:49.835
Yeah. I know.

01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:53.293
- But I needed to see you.
- And now you do.

01:35:56.084 --> 01:35:58.960
I thought... if I could see you

01:36:00.126 --> 01:36:01.793
talk to you

01:36:01.917 --> 01:36:04.377
I could make things better. You know?

01:36:07.126 --> 01:36:09.043
Try at least.

01:36:12.751 --> 01:36:14.043
Anyroad...

01:36:17.251 --> 01:36:18.460
Is that it?

01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:26.293
Nothing else?

01:36:35.167 --> 01:36:36.627
I should...

01:36:36.751 --> 01:36:38.252
Yeah.

01:36:38.376 --> 01:36:39.835
OK.

01:36:52.959 --> 01:36:54.377
I'm trying to do this.

01:36:54.834 --> 01:36:58.418
Don't you see?
I'm... I'm trying to sort it out.

01:37:00.084 --> 01:37:04.543
And I've come all this way up here,
on a coach and everything.

01:37:06.251 --> 01:37:08.252
And I want you to come back.

01:37:09.459 --> 01:37:10.543
With me.

01:37:15.167 --> 01:37:17.627
And I want us to be together.

01:37:26.792 --> 01:37:29.002
I don't want to be a fuck-up anymore.

01:37:30.251 --> 01:37:32.252
No, leave me. I'm fine.

01:37:36.334 --> 01:37:37.668
I want to be with you.

01:37:42.626 --> 01:37:44.627
And that's what I needed to say.

01:37:58.667 --> 01:38:00.043
You're a freak.

01:38:04.667 --> 01:38:05.960
So are you.

01:38:08.417 --> 01:38:09.543
Faggot.

01:38:16.542 --> 01:38:17.918
Fuck off...

01:38:19.501 --> 01:38:20.752
...faggot.

01:39:39.376 --> 01:39:41.002
<i># Days</i>

01:39:44.209 --> 01:39:45.918
<i># Passing days</i>

01:40:00.667 --> 01:40:03.418
<i># I see the steeple</i>

01:40:06.292 --> 01:40:08.877
<i># And trace to the spire</i>

01:40:12.751 --> 01:40:14.752
<i># And the sunset</i>

01:40:16.084 --> 01:40:18.046
<i># Deep in regret</i>

01:40:18.126 --> 01:40:21.085
<i># Phoenix in final fire</i>

01:40:24.209 --> 01:40:27.293
<i># And the time stops</i>

01:40:29.501 --> 01:40:33.335
<i># Rush-hour traffic slows</i>

01:40:35.417 --> 01:40:37.835
<i># And my heart starts</i>

01:40:38.917 --> 01:40:40.879
<i># Beating this dark</i>

01:40:40.959 --> 01:40:44.377
<i># Through old flesh and cold bones</i>

01:40:46.501 --> 01:40:52.210
<i># And I long to be carried on</i>

01:40:54.042 --> 01:40:59.127
<i># Just once to be lifted strong</i>

01:41:00.209 --> 01:41:04.171
<i># Out of the loneliness</i>

01:41:04.251 --> 01:41:06.254
<i># And the emptiness</i>

01:41:06.334 --> 01:41:08.752
<i># Of the days</i>

01:41:11.417 --> 01:41:13.585
<i># Days</i>

01:41:17.626 --> 01:41:19.752
<i># Passing days</i>

01:41:25.542 --> 01:41:27.504
<i># Days</i>

01:41:27.584 --> 01:41:32.377
<i># I remember I had your love once</i>

01:41:34.626 --> 01:41:37.543
<i># Seized my body whole</i>

01:41:40.292 --> 01:41:43.462
<i># And in our first dance</i>

01:41:43.542 --> 01:41:45.712
<i># I thought by chance</i>

01:41:45.792 --> 01:41:49.252
<i># God had matched my soul</i>

01:41:50.792 --> 01:41:54.793
<i># But time brought its travelling</i>

01:41:56.542 --> 01:41:59.502
<i># This distance and solitude</i>

01:42:03.126 --> 01:42:05.837
<i># And in that travelling</i>

01:42:05.917 --> 01:42:08.129
<i># My self damaging</i>

01:42:08.209 --> 01:42:13.627
<i># I took my love far, far from you</i>

01:42:14.376 --> 01:42:20.585
<i># But don't you still long to be carried on</i>

01:42:22.001 --> 01:42:26.210
<i># Once more I could lift you strong</i>

01:42:28.084 --> 01:42:31.168
<i># Out of the loneliness</i>

01:42:31.959 --> 01:42:34.087
<i># And the emptiness</i>

01:42:34.167 --> 01:42:38.127
<i># Of the days</i>

01:42:40.001 --> 01:42:42.210
<i># Passing days</i>

01:42:45.501 --> 01:42:48.502
<i># Passing days</i>

01:42:52.126 --> 01:42:54.127
<i># Days</i>

01:42:56.792 --> 01:42:58.754
<i># Tell me</i>

01:42:58.834 --> 01:43:01.379
<i># Have we gone too far?</i>

01:43:01.459 --> 01:43:04.421
<i># Or did we get too close?</i>

01:43:04.501 --> 01:43:05.796
<i># You've no father</i>

01:43:05.876 --> 01:43:07.546
<i># I've no son</i>

01:43:07.626 --> 01:43:10.212
<i># But when we come ghost</i>

01:43:10.292 --> 01:43:13.418
<i># I promise I will meet you</i>

01:43:14.584 --> 01:43:16.046
<i># I will meet you</i>

01:43:16.126 --> 01:43:20.168
<i># At the end of the days</i>

01:43:22.876 --> 01:43:25.168
<i># The days</i>

01:43:28.042 --> 01:43:30.252
<i># Passing days</i>

01:43:37.001 --> 01:43:41.377
<i># Won't you meet me at the end of the days? #</i>
