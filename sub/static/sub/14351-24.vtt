Captain's Log : Star date 5928.5.

00:10.488 --> 00:12.718
The Enterprise has received
a distress call...

00:12.790 --> 00:14.724
from a group of scientists
on Camus 11,

00:14.792 --> 00:17.317
who are exploring the ruins
of a dead civilization.

00:17.395 --> 00:19.829
Their situation is desperate.

00:19.897 --> 00:23.196
Two of the survivors are
the expedition surgeon, Dr. Coleman,

00:23.267 --> 00:27.033
and the leader of the expedition,
Dr. Janice Lester.

00:27.104 --> 00:29.971
- What's wrong with her?
- Exposure to radiation.

00:30.041 --> 00:32.202
What form of radiation was it?

00:32.276 --> 00:33.971
Nothing I've ever encountered.

00:35.212 --> 00:38.875
[Moaning]

00:44.822 --> 00:46.756
Janice.

00:48.225 --> 00:50.750
You must remain absolutely quiet.

00:50.828 --> 00:53.422
Those are doctor's orders,
not mine.

00:55.499 --> 00:57.467
- [Tricorder Whistling]
- [Spock] Captain.

00:57.535 --> 01:00.436
Tricorder picking up
very faint life readings.

01:00.504 --> 01:02.438
Approximately 700 meters from here.

01:02.506 --> 01:05.099
Help will have to be immediate.

01:05.176 --> 01:07.167
[ Moaning ]

01:08.412 --> 01:11.404
Perhaps your presence
will quiet her.

01:20.358 --> 01:23.088
I hoped I wouldn't see you again.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.957
I don't blame you.

01:25.029 --> 01:27.930
The year we were together
at Starfleet...

01:27.999 --> 01:31.196
is the only time in my life
I was alive.

01:31.268 --> 01:34.101
I never stopped you from
going on with your space work.

01:34.171 --> 01:38.267
Your world of starship captains
doesn't admit women.

01:40.044 --> 01:43.207
- It isn't fair.
- No, it isn't.

01:43.280 --> 01:47.614
And you punished and tortured me
because of it.

01:51.522 --> 01:53.456
I loved you.

01:55.359 --> 01:58.021
We could've roamed among the stars.

01:58.095 --> 01:59.960
We'd have killed each other.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.465
It might have been better.

[High-Pitched Tone]

03:15.740 --> 03:18.675
[Kirk]
Space -- the final frontier.

03:24.715 --> 03:29.049
These are the voyages of
the starship Enterprise.

03:29.120 --> 03:33.216
Its five-year mission--
to explore strange new worlds,

03:33.290 --> 03:37.090
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

03:37.161 --> 03:40.653
to boldly go
where no man has gone before.

04:36.787 --> 04:38.721
[ Laughs ]

04:38.789 --> 04:40.723
You had your chance,
Captain Kirk.

04:40.791 --> 04:42.725
You should've smothered
the life in me.

04:42.793 --> 04:45.284
Then they would have said
Dr. Janice Lester...

04:45.362 --> 04:47.956
died of radiation poisoning
in the line of duty.

04:48.032 --> 04:50.592
Why didn't you do it?
You always wanted to.

04:50.668 --> 04:52.602
Didn't you?

04:54.538 --> 04:57.564
You had the strength to do it.

04:59.376 --> 05:02.607
But you were afraid.
You were always afraid.

05:02.680 --> 05:07.379
Now Janice Lester
takes the place of Captain Kirk.

05:09.987 --> 05:11.955
I already possess
your physical strength.

05:14.391 --> 05:18.157
Only this Captain Kirk...

05:18.229 --> 05:20.163
is not afraid to kill.

05:20.231 --> 05:23.291
- [ Moans ]
- Now you'll know...

05:23.367 --> 05:25.358
the indignity of being a woman.

05:25.436 --> 05:28.371
[ Moaning Continues ]

05:28.439 --> 05:32.136
For you this agony will
soon pass, as it has for me.

05:32.209 --> 05:35.007
Quiet. Quiet!

05:35.079 --> 05:38.776
Believe me,
it's better to be dead...

05:38.849 --> 05:42.615
than to live alone
in the body of a woman.

05:42.686 --> 05:44.745
- It's better to be dead--

[Footsteps Approaching]

06:00.237 --> 06:03.263
Dr. McCoy, your report.

06:03.340 --> 06:06.207
We were too late, Jim.
There's nothing could be done.

06:06.277 --> 06:10.111
[Kirk]
Was it radiation as suggested?

06:10.180 --> 06:14.276
No, I believe it was celebium,
however, Dr. Coleman disagrees.

06:14.351 --> 06:17.752
To be specific is essential.
The treatment of celebium is--

06:17.821 --> 06:19.880
Dr. McCoy!

06:22.760 --> 06:25.695
Did you notice any unusual symptoms
while we were gone?

06:25.763 --> 06:28.596
[Kirk] Nothing at all.
She was unconscious all of the time.

06:34.605 --> 06:36.539
Dr. Lester is near death.

06:36.607 --> 06:40.236
Perhaps the shock of knowing
what happened to her staff...

06:40.311 --> 06:42.245
is part of her problem.

06:42.313 --> 06:44.975
I'm sure it is.

06:45.049 --> 06:48.610
Beaming her up to the Enterprise
will be less harmful than waiting.

06:48.686 --> 06:50.551
Uh, I don't know.
I-I'm not sure.

Dr. Coleman, accompany the patient
to the sick bay.

Mr. Spock, take the ship
out of orbit.

07:40.704 --> 07:43.298
Resume designated course.

07:45.376 --> 07:48.903
Dr. McCoy, you and Dr. Coleman...

07:48.979 --> 07:50.913
seem to disagree on diagnosis.

07:50.981 --> 07:53.916
No, not entirely.
We both agree it's radiation.

07:53.984 --> 07:57.044
Dr. Coleman isn't prepared to say
what form of radiation.

07:57.121 --> 08:00.090
Will it affect your arriving
at a correct treatment?

08:00.157 --> 08:02.091
It's crucial.

08:03.394 --> 08:06.886
Well, this is especially
disturbing to me...

08:06.964 --> 08:10.491
for... uh, personal reasons.

08:10.567 --> 08:12.694
Oh? I didn't know
you knew her that well.

08:12.770 --> 08:16.706
Oh, yes.
Been a long time since I saw her.

08:16.774 --> 08:19.709
I walked out on her
when it became serious.

08:19.777 --> 08:23.713
Well, you must have been
very young at the time, Jim.

08:23.781 --> 08:26.375
Youth doesn't excuse
everything, Dr. McCoy.

08:27.751 --> 08:29.685
It's a very unhappy memory for me.

08:29.753 --> 08:31.880
I didn't realize that.

08:31.955 --> 08:36.085
- I shall do everything in my power.
- Thank you very much.

08:39.462 --> 08:44.696
Dr. Lesteris certainly a very lucky
young person to have escaped.

08:44.768 --> 08:47.896
Yes, very lucky. Very lucky.

- You'd better put a stop to it!

If you allow Dr. Lester
to become fully conscious...

09:13.230 --> 09:15.198
she'll know what has happened.

- Probably no one will believe it.
- Probably?

- [ Moaning Continues ]
- That's all we can ask for.

09:21.472 --> 09:24.964
How can death be explained now?

09:25.042 --> 09:27.408
I tell you, it can't continue.

09:27.478 --> 09:30.242
You killed every one of the staff.

09:30.314 --> 09:33.806
You sent them where you knew
the celebium shielding was weak.

09:33.884 --> 09:37.047
Why didn't you kill him?
You had the perfect opportunity.

09:38.188 --> 09:40.315
There wasn't enough time.

09:40.390 --> 09:43.791
I gave you every minute
you asked for.

09:43.861 --> 09:46.796
He hung onto life too hard.
I couldn't--

09:46.864 --> 09:48.798
You couldn't because you love him!

09:48.866 --> 09:51.494
You want me to be his murderer.

09:51.568 --> 09:54.560

- It's my life now.
- I won't become a murderer.

10:04.381 --> 10:06.315
You are a murderer!

You knew it was celebium.
You could've treated them for it.

10:21.031 --> 10:23.192
I thought my presence
might quiet Dr. Lester.

- It had the opposite effect.
- It has nothing to do with you.

10:26.036 --> 10:28.971
It's a symptom of the developing
radiation illness.

Tests with the ship's
equipment shows...

10:31.708 --> 10:34.142
no signs of internal
radiation damage, Dr. Coleman.

10:34.211 --> 10:38.272
Didn't Dr. Lester's staff become
delirious before they died?

- [Moaning Continues]
- Uh, yes, Captain. Yes.

I can detect, Jim.

a great deal of experience...

with radiation exposure
on board the Enterprise.

10:55.432 --> 10:57.366
I am guided by his opinion.

Dr. McCoy, I'm sorry,
but I'm going to have to take you...

11:20.991 --> 11:23.323
off the case and turn it over
to Dr. Coleman.

11:23.393 --> 11:27.159
You can't do this! On this ship
my medical authority is final!

11:27.231 --> 11:31.099
If Dr. Coleman wants to assume the
full responsibility, let him do it.

- It means reversing course.
- Yes, it can't be helped.

14:37.020 --> 14:38.954
We must take Dr. Lester
where she can be treated.

- How long to Star base 2?
- Seventy-two hours, Captain.

- Continue present course.
- Aye, sir.

If the diagnosis of Dr. Lester's
illness is the critical problem,

15:02.412 --> 15:05.438
then the Benecia Colony
is definitely not the place for her.

15:05.515 --> 15:08.109
Their medical facilities
are the most primitive.

15:08.185 --> 15:11.643
- They will have to serve.
- Star base 2 is fully equipped...

15:11.721 --> 15:14.417
and staffed with
the necessary specialists...

15:14.491 --> 15:17.983
to determine exactly what
is wrong with the doctor.

15:18.061 --> 15:20.256
Is that not crucial
to your decision?

15:20.330 --> 15:22.264
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

15:22.332 --> 15:25.563
But the facilities will be
of little use if Dr. Lester's dead.

Time is of the essence.
Continue present course.

15:34.544 --> 15:36.512
At maximum speed,

Command of the change of plan?

15:49.659 --> 15:52.594
No change of plan
has been ordered, Lieutenant.

15:52.662 --> 15:55.324
Our arrival at Beta Aurigae
will merely be delayed.

15:55.398 --> 15:58.458
Our gravitational studies of
that binary system will not suffer,

15:58.535 --> 16:00.469
and a life may be saved!

That is not unusual procedure
for the Enterprise.

been informed already.

with Starfleet in these matters,

might be deemed interference.

you from the case.

16:53.323 --> 16:55.257
That is not the reason I'm here.

16:55.325 --> 16:59.193

No, sir. That is the opinion
of Starfleet Command.

was removed from his post...

17:08.438 --> 17:11.999

for administrative incompetence.

duties required here.

medical blunders.

Promotions and demotions can
be politically maneuvered.

- Not in Starfleet Headquarters.

the surgeon general's office.

will have to stand.

17:34.831 --> 17:36.765

17:36.833 --> 17:39.768
that Dr. Coleman's experience
with what happened on the planet...

17:39.836 --> 17:41.770
had to be the deciding factor here.

I’m sure that you can
appreciate that.

you had a decision to make.

to Starfleet regulations.

31:15.499 --> 31:18.059
have given me complete confidence
in myself.

31:18.135 --> 31:22.333
My fears repast. Is hall function
freely as the captain.

31:22.405 --> 31:24.999
l am the captain
of the Enterprise, in fact.

31:25.075 --> 31:28.169
Surely you must have more
than that to go on.

31:28.245 --> 31:30.179
I have stated my evidence--

31:30.247 --> 31:34.115
telepathic communication with
the mind of Captain James T. Kirk.

31:34.184 --> 31:37.847
Your evidence
is completely subjective.

31:37.921 --> 31:42.381
We have to have evidence that
we can examine out in the open.

31:42.459 --> 31:45.951
You've had great deal of evidence,
except that of the chief witness.

31:46.029 --> 31:49.157
The one who should be the real
subject of this investigation...

31:49.232 --> 31:52.690
is kept locked away
and in isolation.

31:52.769 --> 31:55.670
Why... Captain?

31:56.940 --> 32:00.467
She's dangerously insane.
We've seen the evidence.

32:00.544 --> 32:04.241
She is dangerous only
to your authority, sir.

32:05.649 --> 32:08.209
Mr. Spock.

32:10.654 --> 32:14.021
Mr. Spock, my authority has been
given to me by Starfleet Command,

32:14.090 --> 32:17.491
and only that high authority
can take it away.

32:17.561 --> 32:20.792
The witness, sir.
Bring on the witness.

32:20.864 --> 32:23.492
Let your officers
put the questions.

32:31.107 --> 32:34.736
Mr. Nunnely, have
Dr. Janice Lester brought here.

32:34.811 --> 32:36.745
Aye, sir.

32:46.356 --> 32:49.450
Dr. McCoy, while
Mr. Spock was busy...

32:49.526 --> 32:52.757
with his ambitious plot,
what were you doing?

32:52.829 --> 32:55.024
- Examining you.
- Oh, yes.

32:55.098 --> 32:58.590
You were deeply concerned about
my health, emotional and physical,

32:58.668 --> 33:03.071
- since leaving Camus II, correct?
- Yes, that's correct.

33:03.139 --> 33:07.439
Instead of trying to destroy me, you
were searching for ways to help me.

33:08.912 --> 33:10.846
Dr. McCoy, for the record,

33:10.914 --> 33:13.906
will you tell the court
your findings?

33:13.984 --> 33:16.919
The captain is in the best
of physical condition.

33:16.987 --> 33:19.922
His emotional and mental
state is comparable...

33:19.990 --> 33:22.652
to the time he assumed
command of the Enterprise.

33:22.726 --> 33:25.160
Thank you, Dr. McCoy.

33:25.228 --> 33:29.756
Mr. Spock, were you aware
of Dr. McCoy's findings?

33:29.833 --> 33:34.065
- I know them now.
- And what have you to say... now?

33:34.137 --> 33:36.469
I am disappointed
and deeply concerned...

33:36.539 --> 33:41.169
that there is no objective evidence
to support my position... so far.

33:47.984 --> 33:51.920
Dr. Coleman, if you’re
required here, we'll call you.

34:01.398 --> 34:03.332
We certainly appreciate
your being here.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.265
Everyone is deeply aware...

34:05.335 --> 34:08.600
that you have been subjected
to inordinate emotional stress.

34:08.672 --> 34:12.072
We had hoped to avoid
any further stress, but...

34:12.141 --> 34:14.076
Mr. Spock disagrees.

34:14.143 --> 34:17.375
It is his opinion that
your testimony is important...

34:17.447 --> 34:20.041
in determining
the merits of his case.

34:20.116 --> 34:24.643
And since we are solely interested
in arriving at a just decision,

34:24.721 --> 34:27.985
I'm going to have to ask you
a few more questions.

34:28.058 --> 34:29.992
I'll try not to upset you.

34:35.764 --> 34:37.926
You, uh, claim that, uh--

34:38.001 --> 34:40.435
[ Chuckles ]

34:40.503 --> 34:42.971
that you are
Captain James T. Kirk?

34:43.039 --> 34:46.007
No. I am not Captain Kirk.

34:46.076 --> 34:48.510
That is very apparent.

34:48.578 --> 34:50.705
I claim that whatever it is...

34:50.780 --> 34:54.079
that makes James Kirk
a living being special to himself...

34:54.150 --> 34:56.914
is being held here in this body.

34:56.985 --> 34:58.920
Oh. Well--

34:58.988 --> 35:01.752
However, a-a-a-as I understand it,

35:01.825 --> 35:05.226
l... am Dr. Janice Lester.

35:05.295 --> 35:07.820
[ Chuckling Quietly ]

35:09.466 --> 35:13.402
That's very clever,
but I didn't say it.

35:13.470 --> 35:19.033
I said, the body of James Kirk
is being used by Dr. Janice Lester.

35:19.109 --> 35:22.943
Mm-hmm. A subtlety
that somehow escapes me.

35:23.012 --> 35:25.913
I assume that this, uh,

35:25.982 --> 35:28.815
switch was arrived at
by mutual agreement.

35:28.885 --> 35:32.616
No. It was brought about
by a violent attack by Dr. Lester...

35:32.689 --> 35:35.886
and the use of equipment
she discovered on Camus II.

35:35.959 --> 35:38.723
Violence...

35:38.795 --> 35:43.494
by the lady, perpetrated
on Captain Kirk? Tsk, tsk, tsk.

35:43.566 --> 35:47.366
I ask the assembled personnel
to look at Dr. Janice Lester...

35:47.437 --> 35:51.703
and visualize
that historic moment.

35:51.775 --> 35:56.075
Can you-- Can you tell me why,
uh, Dr. Janice Lester...

35:56.146 --> 35:59.707
would agree to this
ludicrous exchange?

35:59.783 --> 36:03.549
Yes. To get the power
she craved:

36:03.620 --> 36:06.316
to attain a position
she doesn't merit...

36:06.389 --> 36:08.880
by temperament or training.

36:08.958 --> 36:12.655
And most of all, she wanted
to murder James Kirk,

36:12.729 --> 36:15.562
a man who once loved her.

36:15.632 --> 36:19.261
But her intense hatred
of her own womanhood...

36:19.335 --> 36:21.565
made life with her impossible.

36:25.208 --> 36:27.438
Are you prepared with witnesses?
One will do.

36:27.510 --> 36:31.844
Sir, there is only
one issue here.

36:31.915 --> 36:35.442
Is the story of life-entity
transfer believable?

36:35.518 --> 36:38.009
This crew has been to many places
in the galaxy.

36:38.087 --> 36:40.351
They've been witness
to many strange events.

36:40.423 --> 36:43.654
They're trained to know that
what seems to be impossible...

36:43.726 --> 36:45.660
often is possible,

36:45.728 --> 36:48.629
given the scientific analysis
of the phenomenon.

36:48.698 --> 36:51.826
Mr. Spock, have you
ever heard of a case...

36:51.901 --> 36:53.869
such as described
by Dr. Janice Lester?

36:53.937 --> 36:57.202
- Not precisely, no.
- Oh.

36:57.273 --> 37:00.709
Assuming that you are correct
in your belief,

37:00.777 --> 37:03.473
do you expect Starfleet Command
to place this, uh,

37:03.546 --> 37:06.811
this, uh, person...

37:06.883 --> 37:09.283
in command of the Enterprise?

37:09.352 --> 37:12.810
I expect only
to reveal the truth.

37:12.889 --> 37:15.289
And with the truth revealed,
that I am not really the captain,

37:15.358 --> 37:18.156
and knowing that she would not
be allowed to serve as the captain,

37:18.228 --> 37:21.220
then you would be the captain--
it is inevitable!

37:27.971 --> 37:31.737
Spock. Spock, give it up!

37:31.808 --> 37:34.538
Return to the Enterprise family.
All charges will be dropped...

37:34.611 --> 37:38.069
and the madness that temporarily
overcame all of us...

37:38.147 --> 37:40.980
on Camus II will fade
and be forgotten.

37:41.050 --> 37:44.486
And what will become
of Dr. Lester?

37:44.554 --> 37:46.988
Dr. Lester will be
cared for always.

37:47.056 --> 37:50.583
It is a debt and a responsibility
I owe her from the past.

37:50.660 --> 37:54.687
No, sir. I shall not withdraw
a single charge that I have made.

37:54.764 --> 37:56.698
You are not Captain Kirk.

37:56.766 --> 37:58.996
You have ruthlessly
appropriated his body.

37:59.068 --> 38:02.231
But the life entity within you
is not that of Captain Kirk.

38:02.305 --> 38:04.603
You do not belong
in charge of the Enterprise...

38:04.674 --> 38:07.438
and I shall do everything
in my power against you.

38:15.218 --> 38:17.550
Lieutenant Lisa, play back
those last two sentences...

38:17.620 --> 38:19.554
from Mr. Spock's tirade.

38:24.327 --> 38:27.057
You do not belong in charge
of the Enterprise...

38:27.130 --> 38:29.428
and I shall do everything
in my power against you.

38:29.499 --> 38:31.660
You heard the statements
placed into the record by you.

38:31.734 --> 38:36.262
-Do you understand the nature of it?
-I do. And I stand by it.

38:37.740 --> 38:42.643
It is mutiny! Deliberate,
vindictive, insane at its base!

38:42.712 --> 38:45.306
But mutiny is charged,
and encouragement to mutiny.

38:45.381 --> 38:48.009
Dr. McCoy, Mr. Scott,
you heard it!

38:48.084 --> 38:50.985
On the basis of these statements,
I call for an immediate vote,

38:51.054 --> 38:53.648
by the powers granted to me
as captain of the Enterprise.

38:53.723 --> 38:57.454
A recess is declared,
to be followed by a vote.

38:57.527 --> 39:01.827
Yes. An immediate vote before our
chief witness can be left to die...

39:01.898 --> 39:04.696
on some obscure planet
with the truth locked inside of her.

39:04.767 --> 39:07.031
Silence. You will be silent!

39:08.771 --> 39:11.638
A recess has been declared.
There will be no cross-discussion.

39:11.708 --> 39:16.304
When I return, we will vote
on the charge of mutiny.

39:16.379 --> 39:19.815
The evidence presented here
is the only basis of your decision.

39:23.620 --> 39:25.986
[Door Slides Open, Shut]

39:44.340 --> 39:46.274
- Scotty.
- Doctor.

39:49.479 --> 39:51.504
Doctor,

39:51.581 --> 39:57.281
I've seen the captain
feverish, sick, drunk,

39:57.353 --> 40:00.117
delirious, terrified,

40:00.189 --> 40:03.352
overjoyed, boiling mad.

40:03.426 --> 40:05.394
But up to now,

40:05.461 --> 40:10.330
I have never seen him
red-faced with hysteria.

40:10.400 --> 40:13.301
I know how I'm going to vote.

40:13.369 --> 40:16.065
I've been through this with Spock.

40:16.139 --> 40:18.437
He's not being scientific
and neither are you.

40:18.508 --> 40:20.567
It may not be scientific,

40:20.643 --> 40:24.636
but if Mr. Spock thinks it happened,
then it must be logical.

40:24.714 --> 40:26.648
Don't you think I know that?

40:26.716 --> 40:29.184
My tests show there's nothing
wrong with the captain.

40:29.252 --> 40:32.153
That's the only fact Starfleet's
going to be interested in.

40:33.823 --> 40:37.816
Headquarters has its problems,
and we have ours.

40:39.128 --> 40:41.062
And right now,

40:41.130 --> 40:44.725
the captain of the Enterprise
is our problem.

40:46.769 --> 40:49.101
They're going to call
for the vote in a few minutes.

40:49.172 --> 40:52.471
Let me put one last question.

40:52.542 --> 40:56.876
Suppose you vote with me,
in favor of Spock.

40:56.946 --> 41:02.077
That means two votes to one
and Spock is free.

41:02.151 --> 41:04.381
What do you think
the captain will do?

41:10.226 --> 41:13.423
- I don't know.
- Aye, you know, all right.

41:14.897 --> 41:18.594
It'll stick in his craw.
He'll never accept it.

41:18.668 --> 41:20.602
We don't know that.

41:20.670 --> 41:23.537
I tell ya, he won't.

41:23.606 --> 41:28.202
Then, Doctor, that's the time
we move against him.

41:30.046 --> 41:32.139
We'll have to take over the ship.

41:32.215 --> 41:34.911
We're talking about mutiny, Scotty.

41:37.487 --> 41:39.421
Aye.

41:42.024 --> 41:43.958
Are you ready for the vote?

41:49.065 --> 41:52.796
Yes. I'm ready for the vote.

42:01.577 --> 42:04.944
Play the tapes of the
conversation in the corridor.

42:05.014 --> 42:07.209
- Aye, sir.
- [ Machine Beeping ]

42:07.283 --> 42:09.945
[ Scotty ]
Then's the time we move against him.

42:11.287 --> 42:13.585
We’ll have to take over the ship.

42:16.459 --> 42:19.792
[McCoy]
We're talking about mutiny, Scotty.

42:19.862 --> 42:23.798
[Scotty]
Aye. Are you ready for the vote?

42:23.866 --> 42:25.959
That's enough.
We know what was said.

42:26.035 --> 42:29.300
Enough to convict you
of conspiracy with mutineers.

42:29.372 --> 42:32.637
And you're so charged.
The sentence-- death.

42:32.708 --> 42:34.642
Mr. Nunnely.

42:34.710 --> 42:36.644
Starfleet expressly
forbids the death penalty.

42:36.712 --> 42:39.772
All my senior officers
turning against me?

42:39.849 --> 42:41.783
The death penalty is forbidden.

42:41.851 --> 42:44.547
- There's only one exception.
- General Order 4.

42:44.620 --> 42:47.214
It has not been violated
by any officer on the Enterprise.

42:47.290 --> 42:51.522
I am responsible. The execution
will be immediate. Go to your posts.

42:53.596 --> 42:55.996
Go to your posts.

42:59.602 --> 43:03.333
Mr. Nunnely, take them to the brig.
Prepare for execution.

43:07.643 --> 43:09.907
Go on!

43:29.732 --> 43:33.429
The captain must be mad if he thinks
he can get away with an execution.

43:33.502 --> 43:36.630
Captain Kirk wouldn't order an
execution even if he were going mad.

43:36.706 --> 43:38.139
That cannot be the captain.

43:38.207 --> 43:39.936
What difference does
it make who he is?

43:40.009 --> 43:42.603
Are we going to allow
an execution to take place?

43:42.678 --> 43:45.909
If security backs him up,
how will we fight him?

43:45.982 --> 43:48.348
I'll fight them every way
and any way I can.

43:49.886 --> 43:52.377
Lt. Lisa, inform all sectors
of my decision. Have each section...

43:52.455 --> 43:55.856
send a representative to the place
of execution on the hangar deck.

43:55.925 --> 43:58.917
- How far to the Benecia Colony?
- Coming within scanning range.

43:58.995 --> 44:00.963
Plot coordinates for orbit.

44:01.030 --> 44:04.124
Mr. Sulu, lock into coordinates
as soon as orbit is accomplished.

44:04.200 --> 44:07.363
Interment will take place
on Benecia.

44:13.676 --> 44:16.577
You have received your orders!

44:18.681 --> 44:20.808
You will obey my orders...

44:20.883 --> 44:23.545
or you’ll be charged with mutiny!

44:24.921 --> 44:28.379
You will obey my orders or-- or--

44:30.993 --> 44:33.154
[ Gasps ]

44:49.478 --> 44:52.072
[ Panting ]

44:52.148 --> 44:54.912
For a moment, I thought that
I was up on the bridge.

44:54.984 --> 44:56.918
Perhaps you were.

44:56.986 --> 44:59.284
Then it's possible
the transference can be broken.

44:59.355 --> 45:02.882
[ Panting ] Well, if it happens
again, I'll fight to stay there.

45:02.959 --> 45:05.086
The bridge is where you belong.

45:05.161 --> 45:07.789
To accomplish that,
each one of us must be ready...

45:07.863 --> 45:10.832
to seize any opportunity
to break out of here...

45:10.900 --> 45:14.165
- and attack.
- [ Gasps ]

45:38.260 --> 45:41.957
- The transference is weakening.
- What happened?

45:42.031 --> 45:44.522
For a moment, I found myself
back with the prisoners.

45:46.035 --> 45:49.300
I will not go back
to being Janice Lester!

45:49.372 --> 45:51.169
You must help me prevent it.

45:51.240 --> 45:53.538
The only way to prevent
the transference...

45:53.609 --> 45:57.045
is by the death of Janice Lester.

45:57.113 --> 45:59.172
You must carry out the execution.

45:59.248 --> 46:02.809
I can't. I can't.

46:02.885 --> 46:05.319
The crew is in mutiny.

46:07.056 --> 46:10.492
You must kill her for me.

46:10.559 --> 46:13.892
I have done
everything else for you.

46:13.963 --> 46:17.399
- But I will not murder for you.
- Then do it for yourself.

46:29.945 --> 46:32.505
If Kirk doesn't die,

46:32.581 --> 46:35.015
we'll both be exposed as murderers.

46:37.586 --> 46:40.020
Does that give you any choice?

46:57.506 --> 46:59.940
The dosage should be doubly lethal.

47:02.511 --> 47:04.445
It is.

47:20.429 --> 47:24.263
To prevent further conspiracy, you
will be removed to separate cells.

47:24.333 --> 47:27.063
If there’s any resistance,
you'll be given a sedative...

47:27.136 --> 47:29.502
until you learn cooperation.

47:29.572 --> 47:31.506
Dr. Lester will be first.

47:33.809 --> 47:35.743
Follow Dr. Coleman.

47:41.417 --> 47:43.510
May I point out, Captain--

47:43.586 --> 47:45.349
[Grunting]

47:45.421 --> 47:46.911
Kill him!

47:47.823 --> 47:49.757
Kill him! Ohh!

48:14.016 --> 48:18.976
I've lost to the captain.
I've lost to James Kirk!

48:19.054 --> 48:21.921
I want you dead!

48:21.991 --> 48:26.485
[ Sobbing ] I want you dead!
I want you dead!

48:28.397 --> 48:32.527
Oh, I'm never
going to be the captain.

48:32.601 --> 48:35.729
[Sobbing Continues]
Never. Kill him.

48:45.147 --> 48:47.638
You are--

48:47.716 --> 48:50.207
You are as I loved you.

48:50.286 --> 48:52.777
Kill him.

48:53.889 --> 48:55.880
Can you do anything for her?

48:59.695 --> 49:01.754
I'd like to take care of her.

49:01.830 --> 49:05.231
[Crying]

49:05.301 --> 49:07.735
Of course. Come with me.

49:20.616 --> 49:23.016
I didn't want to destroy her.

49:23.085 --> 49:26.248
I'm sure we all
understand that, Captain.

49:26.322 --> 49:30.520
Her life could have been
as rich as any woman's. If only--

49:34.029 --> 49:35.963
If only--

49:36.305 --> 49:42.857
