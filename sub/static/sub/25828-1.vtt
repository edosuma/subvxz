00:54.188 --> 00:58.557
She used to say that the cars in the
night could sound like the ocean.

01:03.497 --> 01:07.466
Like the waves running in
and out like the tide.

01:13.140 --> 01:19.144
You squeeze your eyes tight enough,
you could almost see the sun...

01:19.146 --> 01:23.382
smell the salt... feel the sand.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.822
Doesn't matter where
you are, she say.

01:29.824 --> 01:31.824
Just listen to that sound,

01:31.826 --> 01:35.394
and you're on a bright sunny
beach relaxin' in the sun.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.540
I keep trying.

01:48.542 --> 01:52.377
But, Ma, every time
I close my eyes...

01:53.547 --> 01:55.214
all I see is you.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.825
Two minutes.

02:16.804 --> 02:21.306
Angel, you have here a
string of offenses.

02:21.308 --> 02:24.676
I see shoplifting, drug use.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.446
But your last one, the one that
got you in here, what was it?

02:27.448 --> 02:28.847
Unlawful possession of a weapon.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.816
- And what was that weapon?
- A handgun.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.218
That's right.

02:33.220 --> 02:36.388
You turn 18 in two
days and I have here

02:36.390 --> 02:38.490
a recommendation
for your release.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.425
But, I don't see anyone
here with you today,

02:40.427 --> 02:41.727
so where will you be staying?

02:41.729 --> 02:44.329
With her girlfriend.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.265
Hm, no family members?

02:46.267 --> 02:48.800
I understand the mother's deceased.
And the father?

02:48.802 --> 02:53.405
On his appeal, his murder charge was
dropped due to insufficient evidence.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.208
But Angel has no contact
with him at this time.

02:56.210 --> 03:00.746
Oh. Why can't you stay
with the sister, Abigail?

03:00.748 --> 03:03.815
- Uh, she's ten.
- Oh.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.218
How long has it been
since you've seen her?

03:06.220 --> 03:07.619
Couple of years.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.721
[1] You've only been in a year.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.659
I wasn't the best influence.

03:15.262 --> 03:16.728
She's been in 13 foster homes,

03:16.730 --> 03:19.264
unfortunately, with some
sub-standard placements.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.805
- Such as?
- She was

03:20.817 --> 03:22.367
molested in her first placement.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.203
It went unreported over a year.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.705
Why didn't she report it?

03:26.707 --> 03:28.840
She didn't want her
sister to be alone.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.475
Hm.

03:33.447 --> 03:37.482
Here's your one-day bus pass.
Sign here and here.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.618
Bus to Philly's on the corner.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.876
Excuse me. Do you have a charger

04:04.878 --> 04:05.998
I could borrow for my phone?

04:06.022 --> 04:07.312
No, I don't have no charger.

04:08.281 --> 04:09.281
She want a charger?

04:09.283 --> 04:10.749
I got a charger for her.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.591
Do you happen to have a
charger for this phone?

04:12.615 --> 04:14.386
Oh, try next door there.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.391
Excuse me, sir.
My phone is dead.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.553
- Would you happen to have...?
- No, I don't have that.

04:21.577 --> 04:24.329
- You can't even look up at my phone?
- No.

04:24.331 --> 04:26.765
Man, you acting like you so
busy in this empty-ass store.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.401
You can't look up from your
shrimp dick to see my phone?

05:07.541 --> 05:10.442
Hi, this is Maya. I
guess you missed me.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.077
So, leave a message.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.783
Hey, it's Abby.

05:17.785 --> 05:23.789
Um, I was wondering where you
were and if you're okay.

05:23.791 --> 05:27.092
Um, I wanted to know what you
were gonna do for your birthday.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.951
- Marcus?
- Angel, right?

06:59.953 --> 07:02.087
Come on in.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.157
- How's my little Jackie?
- Ready to get out.

07:05.159 --> 07:10.595
Yeah, I bet she is. You got
lucky rooming with her.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.064
I'm gonna do something real special
for her when she gets out.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.000
My little bugaboo.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.504
You only turn 16 once, right?

07:19.506 --> 07:21.506
Come on, follow me.

07:32.085 --> 07:36.521
Yeah, this was my son's room,
so, don't mind the smell.

07:36.523 --> 07:38.156
It's my office now.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.005
Goes right for the Uzi.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.174
What are you doing,
Rambo, robbing a bank?

07:58.078 --> 08:00.118
It's actually... it's not
wrong to go with that one.

08:00.120 --> 08:01.953
It's got an extra clip,
and since you don't

08:01.955 --> 08:04.249
shoot on a regular
basis, you got 30 tries.

08:04.251 --> 08:07.853
I already know which one I want.
I want a .380 semi-automatic.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.689
Jackie said you have one.

08:10.691 --> 08:11.756
And how would Jackie know?

08:11.758 --> 08:13.158
It's like a Bryce/Jennings?

08:13.160 --> 08:15.494
Yeah, Bryce/Jennings.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.996
You run track or somethin'?
You got nice strong legs.

08:17.998 --> 08:21.233
- Look, you got one or not?
- Hey, I only carry guns that work,

08:21.235 --> 08:24.736
so, what you see
is what you get.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.243
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

08:31.245 --> 08:33.611
That's definitely not for you.

08:38.751 --> 08:42.087
- You saying I can't handle it?
- Not like that you can't.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.689
Come here, what are you doing?

08:44.691 --> 08:46.791
This goes on your shoulder.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.260
Boom. Like that.

08:48.262 --> 08:51.897
This goes there. This
goes here, right?

08:51.899 --> 08:54.766
Now, when you pull
that trigger...

08:54.768 --> 08:56.902
It'll knock you on your
ass, and you'll blow a hole

08:56.904 --> 08:58.236
the size of your
head in someone.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.839
You gotta keep swaggin' on me?

09:00.841 --> 09:02.941
So what happened, your
boyfriend cheat on you?

09:02.943 --> 09:05.110
Piss you off? What happened?

09:06.747 --> 09:08.313
This is the one you need.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.181
It's a detective's special.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.017
It's small, you can
fit it in your purse

09:12.019 --> 09:14.319
or your little gym
shorts or whatever.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.656
It's my cheapest one.
Packs a big fist.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.658
How much?

09:19.660 --> 09:20.992
I'll give it to you for 150.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.961
That's bullshit. It
ain't even automatic.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.163
- I'll give you 70.
- Darlin', I am not in the business

09:25.165 --> 09:27.566
of girls in skin-tight
jeans coming in here

09:27.568 --> 09:29.768
trying to get stuff free
based off their looks.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.704
- Jackie said I could get a...
- Jackie's a 15-year-old kid.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.640
What does she know about guns?

09:35.642 --> 09:38.343
Look, I'll give you 70 today,
and the rest tomorrow.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.046
You think I'm an asshole?
Is that it?

09:41.048 --> 09:44.816
You just thought you'd come in here
and play me like I'm an asshole.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.155
I'll tell you what.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.290
Since you're a friend
of the family.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.259
You see that net?

09:56.997 --> 10:02.133
You get this in, I'll
give you that for free.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.802
And if I don't?

10:03.804 --> 10:05.737
I fuck you.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.677
Ball doesn't even
fit in the hole.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.799
Turn around.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.270
Just let me touch it.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.217
Fuck.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.787
Hey, hon, what's up?

10:57.024 --> 11:00.959
She stood you up again?
Unbelievable.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.228
I don't know why you're
friends with her.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.097
You're down the street?

11:06.099 --> 11:08.733
Hey, listen, on your way home,
can you pick up some milk?

11:08.735 --> 11:11.936
Yeah, I used the last
of it this morning.

11:11.938 --> 11:14.172
Yeah, okay. Bye.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.307
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.742
What do you think you're doin'?

11:17.744 --> 11:20.311
- What?
- We didn't finish here.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.180
- That's not my problem.
- Yeah?

11:22.182 --> 11:24.249
Sure as shit ain't my problem.
You gotta go.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.917
Come on.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.852
Meet you on the
Strawberry Mansion Bridge

11:27.854 --> 11:29.054
next to the river.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.723
- When?
- I'll let you know.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.224
Do me a favor.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.462
Throw this out.

11:58.452 --> 12:00.885
I'm skinny, and I like sausage.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.721
Yeah!

13:49.396 --> 13:51.930
- You want?
- Oh, no thanks.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.234
So...

13:57.270 --> 14:00.438
Oh. How is your day so far?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.760
Actually, I wanted to ask you
if you have my dad's address?

14:02.784 --> 14:05.184
Hold on now, hang on. Before we
get into that, we got some...

14:05.208 --> 14:07.078
I wanted to apply for a program,

14:07.080 --> 14:09.280
and they said I need my dad's
address for financial aid.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.282
- And I thought maybe you had it.
- Are you leading

14:11.306 --> 14:12.973
this little tκte-ΰ-tκte?

14:15.989 --> 14:17.355
Rule number one:

14:17.357 --> 14:18.590
You cannot travel between

14:18.592 --> 14:20.625
the hours of 8:00
pm and 6:00 am.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.528
Rule number two: You better
not cross state lines.

14:23.530 --> 14:28.466
Rule number three. You report here
for your weekly drug drop tomorrow.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.235
Can you read?

14:37.577 --> 14:39.577
- What, too many pages?
- No.

14:39.579 --> 14:43.648
Well, good. 'Cause you violate
one thing in that list,

14:43.650 --> 14:45.416
and you're back inside.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.053
So you have your goal
sheet filled out?

14:49.055 --> 14:51.556
- My what?
- Your goal sheet?

14:51.558 --> 14:53.424
You were supposed to
write down three goals

14:53.426 --> 14:54.893
while you were in
the waiting room?

14:54.895 --> 14:56.394
Oh, she didn't tell me.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.964
- She didn't tell you?
- She didn't.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.934
Okay, look.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.776
I'm gonna help make this
as smooth as possible.

15:04.800 --> 15:10.408
So, you tell me.
What are your goals?

15:10.410 --> 15:14.612
- I mean, I want a job.
- Just any old job.

15:18.285 --> 15:21.920
Look, I'm gonna tell you
something, Miss Lamere.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.155
You wanna listen to me here?

15:24.157 --> 15:27.525
At the end of the
day, nobody cares.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.687
I mean, sure, you might be
able to get somebody's pity,

15:29.711 --> 15:33.965
but nobody really cares if
you make it or you don't.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.567
Miss Lamere?

15:36.569 --> 15:38.603
You can work with
me or not, okay?

15:38.605 --> 15:43.374
I'm your friend here, but
I got 62 other cases,

15:43.376 --> 15:46.244
and I learned the hard way
that I only have time

15:46.246 --> 15:47.806
for the kids that
actually want my help.

15:47.830 --> 15:49.696
I'm not asking for your help.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.054
Then I don't have time for you.

16:04.364 --> 16:08.266
- I used to wanna be a teacher.
- You wanna be a teacher?

16:08.268 --> 16:10.001
I'm saying I used to
wanna be a teacher.

16:10.003 --> 16:13.304
- Do you have a degree?
- No.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.306
So I'm glad we got
that out there,

16:15.308 --> 16:17.175
'cause now you have a goal.

16:17.177 --> 16:21.479
But more immediately,
we need a job.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.114
You need to take concrete steps.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.016
This world isn't just
gonna open up for you.

16:25.018 --> 16:28.453
Okay, need a job,
how do I get that?

16:28.455 --> 16:31.990
That is not the tactic you
wanna take with me, my friend.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.061
Look, we're outta time, so...

16:37.063 --> 16:41.366
I'm gonna have you interview
with Job Corps tomorrow.

16:41.368 --> 16:44.769
This is the address.
Take some ID with you.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.638
And I'm gonna write
this down as mandatory.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.574
I don't have ID.

16:49.576 --> 16:52.710
Well, then take your birth
certificate to DMV and get one.

16:52.712 --> 16:56.180
- They can't find it.
- Apply for a new one.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.249
Then I need my dad's address.

17:11.297 --> 17:13.598
Okay, so your father is...

17:13.599 --> 17:15.700
- John Lamere.
- John...

17:17.170 --> 17:19.337
Your father was
charged with murder?

17:19.339 --> 17:21.172
Yeah.

17:21.174 --> 17:25.343
- Murdering your mother?
- But they released him, so...

17:26.613 --> 17:28.112
Yeah.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.682
I can't give you that.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.365
- Hello?
- Hello,

17:41.377 --> 17:43.227
Uncle Roger, it's me, Angel.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.164
Uncle Roger?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.266
Yeah, I'm here.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.501
- You out?
- Yeah.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.670
Well, that's good.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.208
- Uh...
- Yeah, I was just wondering

17:57.210 --> 17:59.377
if you knew where my dad was.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.184
Did you talk to Abby?

18:08.088 --> 18:09.654
Why?

18:09.656 --> 18:11.789
You know he's seen her, right?

18:15.628 --> 18:17.295
All right?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.204
Gimme that.

18:26.206 --> 18:29.540
- How many has he smoked?
- Twice.

18:29.542 --> 18:32.710
- Three times.
- That's why you're so stupid.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.379
- Get on my level.
- What's two plus two?

18:35.381 --> 18:37.448
Twenty-two, I mean, four. Four.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.650
No, you can't take that back.
You know that you said 22.

18:39.674 --> 18:42.342
- Yes, I can.
- You know that you said 22.

18:54.267 --> 18:57.268
Two plus two is four and not 22.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.270
Don't make yourself
even more dumb.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.992
You know your
multiplication tables?

19:01.016 --> 19:03.508
- Twelve times 12.
- One hundred forty-four.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.665
Give me all the totals.

19:04.677 --> 19:05.843
Give me all the totals
and then I'll think

19:05.845 --> 19:07.778
- that you're not dumb.
- Who is that?

19:07.780 --> 19:09.900
- What?
- Fuck, where'd I put the weed?

19:09.924 --> 19:11.849
I don't know, we
had it somewhere.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.919
What y'all kids doing
back here, lightin' up?

19:14.921 --> 19:17.388
- Who're you?
- Who are you?

19:17.390 --> 19:18.523
Why do you care?

19:18.525 --> 19:20.491
You a social worker?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.760
That's my sister, dummy.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.829
So, you're the one
adopting Abby?

19:24.831 --> 19:27.498
'Cause she always saying, "As
soon as my sister get out",

19:27.500 --> 19:29.734
she's gonna be 18 and
she comin' to get me."

19:29.736 --> 19:31.235
- Blah, blah, blah, shut up!
- I am.

19:31.237 --> 19:32.770
As soon as I get my
situation straight,

19:32.772 --> 19:34.605
be the first thing I do.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.845
So, can you be my mom, too?
I'm tired of this place.

19:44.617 --> 19:48.819
- You sure she won't be home soon?
- Yeah, she just left for work.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.792
Is that her real
daughter's room?

19:54.794 --> 19:56.494
Yeah.

19:58.731 --> 20:01.232
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.441
You look different.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.646
Yeah, I put on some pounds.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.950
- No, not that.
- My hair is different.

20:21.421 --> 20:24.722
That's Sharize's. She's crazy.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.637
You been here awhile.
It's a good place, right?

20:39.639 --> 20:41.228
I hate it.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.040
Okay, well, you don't
have to like everything.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.979
Well, I got you something.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.785
It's okay if you don't like it.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.354
This is great.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.916
I said you don't
have to like it.

20:57.940 --> 21:00.173
It's got the glue and the tape.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.961
Guess what? I just
got a new job.

21:03.963 --> 21:07.798
- Really? When do you start?
- I don't even know yet.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.268
They need these documents before
I could officially start,

21:10.270 --> 21:11.969
but they said I got it.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.939
What do you mean?

21:14.941 --> 21:17.541
Well, you know my binder,
with all my information?

21:17.543 --> 21:19.910
They can't find it.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.480
It should be fine though.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.715
You think it's in my files?

21:26.319 --> 21:28.019
Maybe.

21:28.021 --> 21:29.920
I can go look.

21:29.922 --> 21:32.723
Yeah... bring it here.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.452
Gotcha.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.520
No, you got me.

22:38.758 --> 22:42.093
They got you on Seroquel,
Vyvanse and Ritalin?

22:42.095 --> 22:43.694
Yeah.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.463
You gonna fight me?
You gonna fight me?

22:45.465 --> 22:47.932
- Don't take any of that zombie shit.
- I don't.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.574
They just give it to
you so you ain't mad,

22:49.576 --> 22:50.936
so they don't have
to deal with you

22:50.960 --> 22:52.436
feeling things you're feeling.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.972
- Hold me, please?
- Know what I do?

22:54.974 --> 22:58.075
Know how foster moms get more
money if you're trouble?

22:58.077 --> 23:00.778
Well, me and Chief,
we sell the meds.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.681
And she ain't trippin', 'cause
she making the extra income,

23:03.683 --> 23:06.617
and we cut her some
of the profits.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.561
Hug.

23:22.435 --> 23:25.002
Nobody arranges
visitations with you?

23:25.004 --> 23:27.004
Uncle Roger, nobody?

23:36.682 --> 23:39.583
We're busy. Come on.

23:40.586 --> 23:43.020
It's your turn to watch him.

23:50.863 --> 23:53.564
- No other family members?
- Like who?

23:53.566 --> 23:56.534
I don't know. John?

24:06.879 --> 24:09.914
All right. Give me a hug.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.916
Gotta go.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.717
Why?

24:13.719 --> 24:17.221
- Gotta go.
- Where're you gonna sleep tonight?

24:17.223 --> 24:18.889
A friend's place.

24:18.891 --> 24:20.591
- Your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

24:23.229 --> 24:24.795
What?

24:46.619 --> 24:48.552
Angel, I forgot.

24:48.554 --> 24:52.223
- I did see him a few months ago.
- Where?

24:52.225 --> 24:56.494
We had to take one of those,
it's like not the regular buses.

24:56.496 --> 24:58.195
Okay, what's the address?

24:58.197 --> 25:01.665
Oh, the thing is, I
don't know it by heart.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.838
You don't know it.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.507
I mean, I could show it to you.

25:09.509 --> 25:10.508
You can't come with me.

25:10.510 --> 25:11.275
I'll remember which buses

25:11.277 --> 25:12.243
when I see the signs.

25:12.245 --> 25:13.777
And then we get there,

25:13.779 --> 25:14.778
I'll know what the
houses look like

25:14.780 --> 25:15.846
so I'll know where to go.

25:15.848 --> 25:16.947
We can go tomorrow morning.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.782
Abby, you cannot come with me.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.690
Okay.

25:33.065 --> 25:35.099
What time?

25:40.206 --> 25:44.041
Hey, this is Maya. I guess
you missed me. So...

26:10.169 --> 26:14.138
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K,

26:14.140 --> 26:20.277
L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S,
T, U, V, W, X, Y and...

26:20.279 --> 26:23.280
She's leaving me.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.584
Hey, this is Maya.

26:26.586 --> 26:29.587
I guess you missed me.
So, leave a message.

26:30.356 --> 26:33.223
Hey, Maya, it's me, Angel.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.926
Anyway, I'm out. So...

26:38.197 --> 26:40.664
And if I can't stay
with you, it's cool.

26:40.666 --> 26:45.636
You just gotta let me know so I
can make other arrangements.

26:45.638 --> 26:48.038
Or maybe you ran out of
minutes or something.

26:48.040 --> 26:51.709
Uh, anyway, just call me back.

27:36.088 --> 27:38.689
Goddamn!

27:38.691 --> 27:42.893
Who is that fine-looking
specimen at my door?

27:42.895 --> 27:45.763
I'm sorry. I tried calling you.

27:45.765 --> 27:49.967
Yeah, no, I ran out of minutes.

27:49.969 --> 27:53.103
So, you coming from
work or something?

27:53.105 --> 27:54.772
You look nice.

27:54.774 --> 27:57.041
Yeah, actually, I
just got promoted.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.176
Shit, really?

27:59.178 --> 28:02.246
They didn't make you do, like, a
whole shit ton of things, did they?

28:02.248 --> 28:06.417
Some guy came to check if there was an
extra mattress and no drugs around.

28:06.419 --> 28:09.153
Oh, shit. No.

28:09.155 --> 28:11.188
No, I'm done with all that.

28:11.190 --> 28:14.825
It's just a little weed here and
there, but that's about it.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.730
What's this?

28:19.732 --> 28:22.466
- You got it by yourself?
- No.

28:22.468 --> 28:25.936
- You should've waited for me.
- I did wait.

28:26.906 --> 28:28.238
You weren't with nobody?

28:28.240 --> 28:31.742
Like, your cellmate
or some shit?

28:31.744 --> 28:33.711
My cellmate, Jackie, all
she kept talking about

28:33.713 --> 28:36.814
was all the ways she was gonna
kill herself when she got out.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.851
And what did you think about?

28:40.853 --> 28:43.153
You, obviously.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.225
- What?
- Nothing.

28:51.097 --> 28:54.064
You're seeing someone.

28:54.066 --> 28:58.969
It's just, you and
me, I don't know.

28:58.971 --> 29:00.471
I can't get close to you.

29:00.473 --> 29:02.272
I mean, you don't even
tell me everything.

29:02.274 --> 29:05.409
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't know. Things.

29:05.411 --> 29:08.278
Like what?

29:08.280 --> 29:10.414
Yes, I want to do
something with my life.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.816
But every time I tried,
it's always something.

29:12.818 --> 29:14.251
Some form I didn't
fill out right,

29:14.253 --> 29:15.953
some other person
I gotta contact.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.188
And it's for what?

29:18.190 --> 29:22.025
Because that's what
people do, Angel.

29:22.027 --> 29:24.261
People talk about shit.

29:25.331 --> 29:27.331
For what? I mean,
you want me to say

29:27.333 --> 29:32.202
that I can't close my eyes at
night without seeing my father

29:32.204 --> 29:34.404
banging my mom's head
against the bathroom wall,

29:34.406 --> 29:38.809
and me standing there waiting for her
to get up like a fuckin' asshole?

29:41.947 --> 29:43.814
Yeah, maybe.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.161
Look...

30:01.834 --> 30:04.334
But I didn't think that you
honestly wanted to crash here.

30:04.336 --> 30:05.624
I just thought...

30:05.636 --> 30:07.356
It's cool. I got a whole
lotta other bitches

30:07.380 --> 30:09.781
following me and shit, so...

32:36.255 --> 32:37.955
Fuck.

36:06.431 --> 36:07.898
Take it easy.

37:31.950 --> 37:34.551
And so I was, like, "Sharize,
I love your dress."

37:34.553 --> 37:36.993
But really I was sayin', "Honey,
you need to go buy yourself",

37:37.017 --> 37:41.524
a new dress because that's not on fleek,
unique, or any other type of word."

37:41.526 --> 37:43.460
- How can I help you?
- Can I have two

37:43.462 --> 37:45.528
round-trip tickets to Long
Beach Island, please?

37:45.530 --> 37:47.797
- Sure.
- Abby, you sure that's the right one?

37:47.799 --> 37:50.000
Yeah, I told you.
So anyway, I mean,

37:50.002 --> 37:52.242
I think she wants to be my
sister or something be like...

37:52.266 --> 37:54.404
Look, um, go get yourself
a snack or something.

37:54.406 --> 37:55.972
Okay, it's gonna come to...

37:55.974 --> 38:00.910
Um, actually, I need one
round-trip ticket and a one-way.

38:00.912 --> 38:03.747
- Oh, so only one round-trip?
- Yes.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.518
It's $42.50 for the round-trip,

38:08.520 --> 38:13.356
and $26 for the one-way,
comes to $68.50.

38:13.358 --> 38:15.458
Listen, you don't
have, like, um...

38:15.460 --> 38:18.495
a single parent discount
or anything like that?

38:18.497 --> 38:21.598
Hey, they only have gum.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.500
- That's your kid?
- Yeah.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.802
Everyone always
thinks we're sisters.

38:25.804 --> 38:29.539
I'll give you a student discount.
Comes to $50.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.007
Thank you.

38:31.009 --> 38:33.910
Hey, this is not gonna be enough.
I'm hungry.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.879
- Can we please get some real food?
- Okay.

38:35.881 --> 38:38.515
- All right, that's one round-trip...
- Okay, thank you.

38:38.517 --> 38:41.484
So then we're all, like,
trying to solve whatever X is,

38:41.486 --> 38:43.687
and Ms. Grayson has her
back turned to the board.

38:43.689 --> 38:46.723
And I'm just sitting there,
minding my own business

38:46.725 --> 38:48.325
just finding what X is,

38:48.327 --> 38:50.760
when, again, Sarah
just leans over to me

38:50.762 --> 38:52.996
and says, "Ew, do you
even wash your hair?"

38:52.998 --> 38:55.999
And so I whispered back that
she's a silly-ass thot,

38:56.001 --> 38:58.802
and then I'm the one
that gets in trouble.

38:58.804 --> 39:01.471
Next time you call her
little ass that after class.

39:01.473 --> 39:03.773
So, anyway, that's
why me and Sarah,

39:03.775 --> 39:05.642
we ain't in the
same class no more.

39:05.644 --> 39:08.478
- So, where's Sarah now?
- Same place she's always been.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.647
- What class you in?
- A different one.

39:10.649 --> 39:12.749
But still advanced program?

39:15.087 --> 39:16.920
Abby.

39:16.922 --> 39:18.655
You gotta get back
in that program.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.424
Hey, you, you listening to me?

39:21.426 --> 39:23.026
You can't get kicked
out of that program.

39:26.765 --> 39:27.798
You did.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.679
Come on, pay up. And don't
leave her ass no tip,

39:29.703 --> 39:31.869
she didn't even fill
your drink not one time.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.515
What?

39:45.517 --> 39:48.551
We used to live down that way.

39:48.553 --> 39:51.020
So, what, he fucking
live by the beach now?

39:52.124 --> 39:53.890
How come?

39:53.892 --> 39:56.126
We used to go there on
birthdays, I told you that.

40:03.634 --> 40:04.634
Stop.

40:07.038 --> 40:08.505
Stop!

40:19.151 --> 40:21.618
I hate my hair.

40:23.588 --> 40:24.988
Why?

40:24.990 --> 40:27.524
'Cause I don't know
what to do with it.

40:27.526 --> 40:29.526
I don't know what to
do with mine either.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.728
I just get bored and I
pull it into a twist

40:31.730 --> 40:33.496
or a braid or something.

40:33.498 --> 40:38.535
I don't know how to do twists.
Or braids.

40:40.906 --> 40:43.973
- Want me to try?
- Yeah.

40:51.450 --> 40:52.749
Ow.

40:54.586 --> 40:58.455
- Leave some hair on my damn head!
- It don't even hurt that bad.

41:10.669 --> 41:13.136
Ow!

41:13.138 --> 41:14.938
Now the headband...

41:16.675 --> 41:18.208
Now, right behind...

41:19.778 --> 41:21.211
Thanks.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.884
Ow, stop!

41:42.033 --> 41:45.602
I'm gonna have to post this one.

41:45.604 --> 41:48.505
I'm not supposed to see you
unsupervised, remember?

41:58.884 --> 42:01.851
My belly feels funny.
I'll be right back.

43:04.783 --> 43:07.050
The ones on their face,
it's just like...

43:07.052 --> 43:10.119
I wanna get a tattoo
next to my eye.

43:10.121 --> 43:12.589
I would get some type of, like,
dollar sign or something.

43:22.067 --> 43:23.299
Abby...

43:23.301 --> 43:25.201
Abby, what's going on?

43:26.171 --> 43:27.971
We're playing MASH.

43:27.973 --> 43:29.339
This is Abby's.

43:29.341 --> 43:31.708
Abby Lamere is gonna
live in a mansion

43:31.710 --> 43:34.744
as a roller coaster tester,
married to her principal

43:34.746 --> 43:37.947
in Uzbekistan with 69 children.

43:37.949 --> 43:39.429
Your principal better
be good-looking.

43:39.453 --> 43:40.650
- Yes.
- Because if he's not,

43:40.652 --> 43:42.052
- then that is rough.
- Oh...

43:42.076 --> 43:43.353
I wanna do one for my sister.

43:43.355 --> 43:45.355
- Okay, sit down.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll do one.

43:45.357 --> 43:47.157
Come on, Abby, let's let
them do their thing.

43:47.159 --> 43:48.391
No, it's fine. Here.

43:48.393 --> 43:52.028
Okay, give me four jobs
your sister could have.

43:52.030 --> 43:55.064
Okay, teacher. Our mom was
a paralegal, so put that.

43:55.066 --> 43:57.146
- Writer?
- Yeah, put that one down.

43:57.170 --> 43:58.302
Oh, and a mogul.

44:01.773 --> 44:05.174
All right, everybody,
we're stopping to refill.

44:05.176 --> 44:07.777
Then we'll be on our
way out to the shore.

44:07.779 --> 44:09.312
Please be back in ten minutes.

44:09.314 --> 44:11.047
How do you not like them?

44:11.049 --> 44:12.015
- You can't say that.
- Because they're just chewy.

44:12.017 --> 44:13.816
They're toffee... toffee.

44:13.818 --> 44:15.858
It's delicious. You know
what you should really try?

44:15.882 --> 44:17.020
- Uh-uh.
- These.

44:17.022 --> 44:18.254
- No.
- These are so good.

44:18.256 --> 44:19.856
It's only raisins.

44:19.858 --> 44:22.158
There's no eggs,
no dairy, no soy.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.040
Are you going vegan? I
swear, if you go vegan...

44:24.064 --> 44:25.664
No. What's wrong with that?

44:38.743 --> 44:39.942
Abby.

44:43.982 --> 44:45.415
Abby, come on!

44:45.417 --> 44:47.984
I don't wanna be the
last people on the bus.

44:47.986 --> 44:50.186
What, you shit
yourself or somethin'?

44:55.260 --> 44:58.061
Come on. Stop playin'!

44:58.063 --> 45:01.064
- Go away.
- All right, I'm coming in.

45:01.066 --> 45:03.933
Stop fucking with me, Angel.
I'm not playing.

45:06.071 --> 45:07.236
Leave me alone.

45:07.238 --> 45:09.272
I got my fucking period, okay?

45:09.274 --> 45:11.754
Okay, so what? Do you want me to
get you a tampon or somethin'?

45:11.778 --> 45:13.683
- I don't know!
- What you mean you don't know?

45:13.685 --> 45:17.013
I don't know! I never had
this happen to me before.

45:17.015 --> 45:19.215
All I know is there's
blood fucking everywhere.

45:19.217 --> 45:22.251
- Ain't no blood everywhere.
- Yes, there is.

45:25.156 --> 45:27.323
All right. Be right back.

45:54.786 --> 45:57.420
Come on, come on. Let me in.
Come on, come on, come on,

45:57.422 --> 45:59.062
it's not like you
invented the damn thing.

45:59.086 --> 46:00.586
Okay!

46:03.795 --> 46:06.829
- Don't look at it.
- I won't.

46:06.831 --> 46:09.866
- What is this?
- It's a pad.

46:09.868 --> 46:11.801
It looks like a diaper.
I need a tampon.

46:11.803 --> 46:14.123
You can't use a tampon
on your first time.

46:14.147 --> 46:17.006
- Just stick it on your panties.
- But I don't want to.

46:17.008 --> 46:19.275
Just stick it on there, it's fine.
Look.

46:27.452 --> 46:29.919
- Good?
- Yeah.

46:34.559 --> 46:37.460
Congratulations, you can now
pop a baby out your gooch.

46:37.462 --> 46:39.929
Why you gotta say it like that?

46:56.214 --> 46:57.914
- Fuck.
- Fuck!

47:00.919 --> 47:02.318
I'm sorry.

47:03.288 --> 47:06.355
You mad at me?

47:06.357 --> 47:09.158
I'm gonna go talk to the lady,
see when the next bus is.

47:14.332 --> 47:16.532
Excuse me. We were on
the bus to the beach.

47:16.534 --> 47:19.254
I was wondering if you knew if another
one would come in and stop by?

47:19.278 --> 47:21.778
Not 'til later tonight.

47:25.476 --> 47:27.510
Fuck.

47:27.512 --> 47:30.413
Is there another bus
station near here?

47:30.415 --> 47:32.381
There's a local one that way,

47:32.383 --> 47:34.383
but I don't know what
time it comes in.

47:34.385 --> 47:36.118
All right, thanks.

47:40.425 --> 47:42.859
- Are you sure you can take us?
- Yeah.

47:42.861 --> 47:44.701
You really sure? 'Cause
I don't wanna...

47:44.725 --> 47:47.897
Abby, come on. There's
a local bus that way.

47:47.899 --> 47:49.498
- They can take us.
- Yeah, seriously,

47:49.500 --> 47:51.400
you guys should just come
with us to my mom's house.

47:51.402 --> 47:53.602
It's like a five minute walk
and then she can drive you.

47:53.604 --> 47:55.484
She just gonna drive us?
She don't even know us.

47:55.508 --> 47:57.540
- Yeah.
- Come on.

47:57.542 --> 48:00.209
Like, bad at the same time,
but, like, who cares?

48:00.211 --> 48:03.012
- Who cares?
- Like, God, it is not real.

48:03.014 --> 48:04.947
That's true, because
it could be anything.

48:04.949 --> 48:07.149
Yeah, like we could make
up something about...

48:07.151 --> 48:09.285
about Ray or Mateo.

48:12.190 --> 48:13.470
Don't you think Mateo's so cute?

48:13.494 --> 48:15.258
- Yes. Yes.
- So cute.

48:15.260 --> 48:18.261
- Who's Mateo?
- Oh, just this guy who plays basketball.

48:18.263 --> 48:20.329
Like, it's just his name.
His name's cute.

48:20.331 --> 48:23.065
- Is this your house?
- Yeah.

48:25.937 --> 48:28.437
I saw him play
basketball yesterday.

48:28.439 --> 48:30.273
- Yeah, yeah, I was there.
- Really?

48:30.275 --> 48:33.309
- But Cameron's actually the best.
- Yeah, he is.

48:33.311 --> 48:34.677
Just a trip.

48:34.679 --> 48:37.546
He looks amazing.

48:39.617 --> 48:41.617
It's like, everything he does.

48:41.619 --> 48:44.020
He's amazing at basketball.

48:45.056 --> 48:46.622
His whole scholarship.

48:46.624 --> 48:50.559
He was ugly before
you liked him.

48:50.561 --> 48:52.128
He wasn't ugly before,

48:52.130 --> 48:55.464
It's just the haircut
enhanced all...

49:44.716 --> 49:47.616
- So when's your mom coming?
- She's coming soon.

49:47.618 --> 49:50.753
- Can I use your bathroom?
- It's right around the corner.

49:50.755 --> 49:54.190
That wasn't eye contact.
It's not eye contact...

50:31.629 --> 50:35.564
Angel Lamere, this is your P.O.
calling... again.

50:35.566 --> 50:38.134
You missed your drug drop today.

50:38.136 --> 50:41.437
I called over and you missed
your interview, as well.

50:41.439 --> 50:44.573
Now, you better call
in immediately.

50:44.575 --> 50:46.442
You have my number.

51:09.367 --> 51:11.600
And this is a suicide.

51:12.837 --> 51:15.171
Wait.

51:15.173 --> 51:16.806
- Oh, no.
- That is disgusting.

51:16.808 --> 51:18.707
- Ew.
- All right. Now, we need to draw straws

51:18.709 --> 51:20.242
to see who'll drink it first.

51:20.244 --> 51:22.778
Oh, my God, that's her.

51:22.780 --> 51:24.713
Hey, Mom. I was gonna call you.

51:24.715 --> 51:26.849
- Hey, don't you have to call him?
- Who?

51:26.851 --> 51:28.384
They mean John.

51:28.386 --> 51:30.386
Yeah, just so he
knows where you are.

51:30.388 --> 51:32.621
Oh, uh, his cell broke.

51:32.623 --> 51:35.257
- He doesn't have a house phone?
- It's a new house, so.

51:35.259 --> 51:37.139
- Do you want me to look it up?
- No, it's cool.

51:37.141 --> 51:38.981
Oh, yeah, she's really
good at finding numbers.

51:39.005 --> 51:40.296
- Someone help me!
- Coming!

51:40.298 --> 51:42.098
One time she found my
second cousin's cousin.

51:42.100 --> 51:44.500
The green bag is
right back there.

51:44.502 --> 51:45.782
Your last name is Lamere, right?

51:45.806 --> 51:48.671
- Yeah, but...
- L-A-M-E-R-E?

51:48.673 --> 51:51.173
No. I mean, yeah,
but just don't...

51:51.175 --> 51:53.535
- That's fine, she can totally help you.
- No is no.

51:53.559 --> 51:55.177
I have too much to do
for tonight, Lena.

51:55.179 --> 51:56.245
Hi, girls!

51:56.247 --> 51:57.880
- Hi, Jen.
- Hi, Jen.

51:57.882 --> 51:59.748
Hi, I'm Jen.

51:59.750 --> 52:02.518
Hi, Abigail.

52:02.520 --> 52:03.819
Angel.

52:03.821 --> 52:05.181
So you girls go to
Friends Central?

52:05.205 --> 52:06.655
No.

52:06.657 --> 52:08.457
I thought you said they
rode the bus with you?

52:08.459 --> 52:09.739
Yes, to here, not
the school bus.

52:09.763 --> 52:12.128
- Oh.
- I go to Martin Luther King.

52:12.130 --> 52:14.797
Well, I hear that you
need a ride to the bus?

52:14.799 --> 52:17.639
Yeah, but it's fine. We can just figure
out where we're going from here.

52:17.663 --> 52:20.503
Oh, they just have to go to the beach.
Their dad lives there.

52:20.505 --> 52:23.772
- Oh, he can't come get you?
- No, he's working.

52:23.774 --> 52:26.208
But it's really cool.
We'll figure it out.

52:26.210 --> 52:29.578
Okay, 'cause... I don't
know if I can...

52:29.580 --> 52:31.460
I don't think I can drive
you right this minute.

52:31.462 --> 52:33.762
- It's fine. We could just go.
- Wait, is this your dad?

52:33.764 --> 52:35.251
Maybe I can call you a cab.

52:35.253 --> 52:36.485
No, please don't, it's fine.

52:36.487 --> 52:38.254
It says, "Father of two girls",

52:38.256 --> 52:39.555
- arrested for murder...
- Please don't look at that.

52:39.557 --> 52:41.390
Please, don't look at that!

52:41.392 --> 52:43.926
Oh, shit. I'm really sorry.

52:43.928 --> 52:45.895
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

52:45.897 --> 52:47.930
Oh, no, it'll stain if you...

52:54.532 --> 52:56.892
Listen, when we get there, you
gotta show me where he lives,

52:56.894 --> 52:58.593
and then turn around
and get yourself back.

52:58.595 --> 53:00.809
- But...
- But it might take a while.

53:00.811 --> 53:03.245
Maybe he won't even be home,
and then you'll miss the bus.

53:03.247 --> 53:06.167
And if you miss the bus, they'll come
looking for us and I'll be arrested.

53:06.191 --> 53:08.725
- Do you want me to be arrested?
- No.

53:14.892 --> 53:16.325
What are you doing?

53:16.327 --> 53:17.593
Uh...

53:18.863 --> 53:20.763
Happy Birthday, Angel.

53:26.904 --> 53:28.737
But see? I crossed that out

53:28.739 --> 53:30.673
because you've
already redeemed it.

53:30.675 --> 53:32.741
- What's this?
- It's your birthday present.

53:32.743 --> 53:34.643
- What?
- I didn't forget,

53:34.645 --> 53:36.245
you told me you used to go.

53:36.247 --> 53:38.814
I didn't forget.

53:38.816 --> 53:41.250
Well, so, happy birthday.

53:41.252 --> 53:43.819
Yeah, but we don't have
time to go to the beach.

53:46.457 --> 53:50.559
So the thing is, I wanted to do
something special for your birthday.

53:50.561 --> 53:52.361
And I'll tell you
where Dad lives.

53:52.363 --> 53:55.264
I just wanted to
make today special.

53:55.266 --> 53:56.532
What do you mean?

53:57.501 --> 53:58.901
Well...

54:00.538 --> 54:05.274
I guess the thing is,
Dad don't live here.

54:05.276 --> 54:06.775
Okay, where does he live?

54:06.777 --> 54:09.011
Well, I just wanted to
do something nice first.

54:09.013 --> 54:10.813
- Where does he live, Abby?
- 'Cause I knew if I told you

54:10.815 --> 54:12.781
maybe I won't see you
again for a while.

54:12.783 --> 54:14.383
- I wanted to make it a nice day.
- Abby, I'm not playing games.

54:14.385 --> 54:15.625
- Just us.
- Where does he live?

54:15.649 --> 54:17.215
Where does he live?

54:21.459 --> 54:23.525
He at our old house.

54:26.831 --> 54:29.665
- What?
- I guess.

54:30.968 --> 54:32.801
No, we don't have
the house no more.

54:32.803 --> 54:34.703
He sold it to pay for his
lying fucking lawyer.

54:34.705 --> 54:36.438
He rentin' back.

54:38.743 --> 54:41.810
- So what, you went to go see him there?
- I didn't know.

54:41.812 --> 54:43.712
- You gonna live with him there now?
- No.

54:43.714 --> 54:46.015
- So, why you seeing him?
- I don't know!

54:46.017 --> 54:48.450
Everybody else got a dad.
I wanted one, too.

54:48.452 --> 54:50.819
He killed your mother, Abby!
In that house!

54:52.423 --> 54:54.056
And look at you!

54:54.058 --> 54:56.178
Walking around with my mother's
name on your backpack,

54:56.202 --> 54:57.493
acting like you
love her so much?

54:57.495 --> 54:58.560
Don't you ever say that!

54:58.562 --> 54:59.628
What, are you crazy?

54:59.630 --> 55:00.910
You don't love her more than me!

55:00.934 --> 55:02.334
Stop!

55:06.604 --> 55:08.037
You're a bitch and a fuck-up

55:08.039 --> 55:10.606
and you act like you're
the only one alone!

55:17.481 --> 55:19.348
You left me!

56:46.771 --> 56:49.138
- I wanna redeem it.
- Forget it.

56:51.142 --> 56:52.574
Please?

56:54.412 --> 56:57.146
Look, can we please just go
to the goddamn fuckin' ocean?

56:57.148 --> 56:59.014
I mean, the shit's right there.

57:06.090 --> 57:08.524
Well, since you asked nicely.

57:23.974 --> 57:25.974
So beautiful.

57:36.187 --> 57:37.820
You gonna get in?

57:37.822 --> 57:41.089
- Are you?
- Nah, it's too cold.

57:41.091 --> 57:43.859
Yeah, I can't go in neither.

57:43.861 --> 57:45.160
Yeah, you can.

57:45.162 --> 57:47.729
Yeah, but my shirt's
not long enough.

57:49.700 --> 57:51.834
Wear mine, it's
longer than yours.

57:54.004 --> 57:56.038
There are too many
people around.

58:00.744 --> 58:01.910
Here.

58:49.093 --> 58:51.026
Don't go too far.

58:59.203 --> 59:01.703
Come on, Angel!

59:01.705 --> 59:03.038
Please?

59:28.632 --> 59:29.898
All right.

59:34.104 --> 59:35.337
Come on, ready?

59:35.339 --> 59:36.838
- Come on.
- Nah.

59:36.840 --> 59:39.141
- Come on. Please?
- This is far enough.

59:40.177 --> 59:42.277
One, two, three.

59:46.150 --> 59:48.817
Shit!

59:48.819 --> 59:50.852
Angel!

59:50.854 --> 59:52.921
You wanted to come to the beach!

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:33.929
You having fun?

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:56.652
When was the last time
we came to the beach?

01:00:56.654 --> 01:00:58.120
My tenth birthday.

01:00:58.122 --> 01:00:59.921
How old was I?

01:00:59.923 --> 01:01:01.356
You just turned one, I think.

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:03.191
You kept trying to eat the sand.

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:07.763
- We came mad early for the sunrise.
- Why?

01:01:07.765 --> 01:01:10.132
Ma said anybody could
see a sun set,

01:01:10.134 --> 01:01:14.069
but it takes a motivated
person to see the sun rise.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.206
Was he there?

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:24.112
Yeah.

01:01:24.114 --> 01:01:26.281
He brought a tent, everything,

01:01:26.283 --> 01:01:28.784
to keep you from eating the sand,
but then you'd just crawl out

01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:30.886
and put your face
right in the sand.

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:34.923
Did he hate us?

01:01:36.894 --> 01:01:39.261
He just got meaner and meaner.

01:01:39.263 --> 01:01:41.363
How come?

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:44.032
He lost his job and she
was still working.

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:45.967
I don't really know why.

01:01:57.181 --> 01:01:58.947
Do you think I'm like him?

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.786
I don't think you're like him.

01:02:05.989 --> 01:02:09.391
It was weird when I saw him.

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:13.295
He got me these teddy bears
and this kid's chair,

01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:15.263
like he didn't even
know I was grown.

01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:20.936
We just sat there,
looking around.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.273
Didn't say nothin'.

01:02:31.782 --> 01:02:34.182
Angel, I don't
wanna be with him.

01:02:36.153 --> 01:02:38.420
You don't need him.
You got yourself.

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:42.157
I don't got you?

01:02:43.794 --> 01:02:45.927
You don't want me, Abby.
I'm no good for you.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:48.330
Yes, you are.

01:02:48.332 --> 01:02:51.333
Well, you think I'm this
okay person, but I'm not.

01:02:57.241 --> 01:02:59.808
I think you're the greatest.

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:37.045
Okay.

01:03:47.224 --> 01:03:48.356
Oh...

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:16.117
Abby!

01:04:18.488 --> 01:04:20.956
- Are you okay?
- Why do you have a gun?

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:22.424
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:04:22.426 --> 01:04:24.893
Why the hell do you have a gun?!

01:04:24.895 --> 01:04:27.062
I've been trying to get
rid of the thing all day.

01:04:27.064 --> 01:04:28.530
I was scared when I got out.

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:30.198
You gonna do something bad?

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.967
You think I'm trying
to go back to jail?

01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:34.436
- I'm not gonna do nothin' bad.
- I know it!

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:36.504
I've been trying
to get rid of it!

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:41.476
Come on!

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:44.112
What?

01:04:44.114 --> 01:04:47.315
Listen to me! Come
on, we gotta go!

01:04:47.317 --> 01:04:50.352
I'm not gonna do nothin' bad!

01:04:51.255 --> 01:04:53.221
Come on.

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:54.389
Come on.

01:04:58.195 --> 01:05:00.362
Abby, come on.

01:05:00.364 --> 01:05:04.366
Look, we gotta go. I'm not
gonna do nothin' bad.

01:05:04.368 --> 01:05:06.635
Are you coming back with me?

01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:12.007
I'm coming back with you.

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:23.151
- Got your shoes?
- Yeah.

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:38.526
We're approaching
our first stop.

01:06:38.528 --> 01:06:41.596
The next stop will be
Center City, Philadelphia.

01:06:41.598 --> 01:06:43.565
Please make sure you take
a good look around you

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:47.435
and grab all your belongings.
Thank you for riding with us.

01:09:58.361 --> 01:09:59.694
It's late.

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:03.598
You wanna come in?

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:48.443
Um...

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.248
I was just about to make dinner.

01:10:54.784 --> 01:10:56.251
Now?

01:10:57.687 --> 01:10:59.554
I work nights now.

01:11:04.527 --> 01:11:05.960
What do you do?

01:11:05.962 --> 01:11:09.831
I'm cleaning... over
at an office complex.

01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:13.668
- You're not building anymore?
- It's hard to explain.

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:17.438
I, um... Absence
from the work field.

01:11:22.012 --> 01:11:24.579
You wanna eat?

01:11:24.581 --> 01:11:26.848
I was just about
to make some soup,

01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:29.817
but I can see if I have
something else, too.

01:11:40.864 --> 01:11:43.498
I don't have much.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.766
I've got some carrots.

01:11:44.768 --> 01:11:46.701
We can add that.

01:11:48.938 --> 01:11:50.938
Guess not the greens.

01:11:52.842 --> 01:11:54.709
The floor is different.

01:11:55.979 --> 01:11:58.846
They had to pull up the
tile to get to some mold.

01:12:06.323 --> 01:12:07.989
You wanna give me a hand?

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:14.028
Yeah, okay.

01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:35.950
Let it run a bit.

01:12:35.952 --> 01:12:38.953
That way you won't
cry from the onions.

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:59.774
Oh, don't make 'em too small,
they may lose their integrity.

01:13:06.516 --> 01:13:08.483
You can have a
seat at the table.

01:13:23.633 --> 01:13:25.533
You in any kinda trouble?

01:13:26.436 --> 01:13:28.803
No.

01:13:28.805 --> 01:13:32.140
Got your housing situation
taken care of yet?

01:13:32.142 --> 01:13:33.975
No.

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:37.712
Well, you know you
gotta do that.

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:46.821
I was 16 when your grandpa
told me I had to leave.

01:13:46.823 --> 01:13:49.424
You know what me and your
Uncle Roger used to do?

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.861
Go through the garbage
bags at the donut shop.

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:57.965
You heard all this before, huh?

01:14:09.712 --> 01:14:11.913
Okay, this is almost ready.

01:14:31.201 --> 01:14:34.502
So, you wanna stay here?

01:14:38.074 --> 01:14:39.106
Maybe.

01:14:39.108 --> 01:14:41.509
Maybe I wanna stay here.

01:14:53.723 --> 01:14:55.723
Why would you move back here?

01:15:05.034 --> 01:15:07.568
I bounced around
for about a year.

01:15:11.574 --> 01:15:14.008
I wanted to get out so bad.

01:15:17.046 --> 01:15:19.914
But when I did, it felt
worse than being here.

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:23.150
I mean, all I can do
to try to keep from

01:15:23.152 --> 01:15:25.786
falling in too
dark of a place...

01:15:27.824 --> 01:15:29.624
was to try to...

01:15:31.995 --> 01:15:34.862
was to try to go
back to a place...

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.301
to the last time it made sense.

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:33.948
- Put the gun down.
- Stay away from her.

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:40.354
You aren't gonna take her.

01:17:40.356 --> 01:17:42.990
She's a kid.

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:44.325
Jesus!

01:17:49.265 --> 01:17:51.832
She doesn't need to
live in this house.

01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:56.370
All right.

01:18:02.378 --> 01:18:04.111
Go ahead.

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:06.947
Shoot me.

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:14.455
Shoot me.

01:18:21.931 --> 01:18:23.364
It happened.

01:18:24.967 --> 01:18:26.467
Okay.

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:32.473
You don't think I'm
living with it?

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:49.924
What do you want from me, Angel?

01:18:55.031 --> 01:18:56.263
Nothing.

01:18:59.202 --> 01:19:01.335
I don't want nothing from you.

01:20:13.209 --> 01:20:16.944
She used to live by the
ocean where she grew up.

01:20:21.584 --> 01:20:25.085
But she said she
loved the city more.

01:20:25.087 --> 01:20:29.523
The people everywhere,
the possibility.

01:20:29.525 --> 01:20:33.327
She said she could always have the
waves if she closed her eyes.

01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:42.536
Man, I miss my mother's eyes.
