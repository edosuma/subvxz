00:15.709 --> 00:17.398
- Welcome back and a big
thanks to DJ Big Tony

00:17.398 --> 00:19.480
for playing his hits.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.040
I'm your host Becks, it's
the title of the show

00:25.040 --> 00:26.810
and also my name.

00:26.810 --> 00:29.330
So Dave before the break
we were discussing your

00:29.330 --> 00:32.940
impressive career as a stand
up comedian, philanthropist,

00:32.940 --> 00:34.760
ladies man.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.160
- Well I am very blessed Becks,

00:37.160 --> 00:40.040
not everyone is born with the raw talent

00:40.040 --> 00:44.023
and the bewildering
feral good looks like me.

00:45.651 --> 00:46.970
- So Dave, in your autobiography,
The Four Pillars of Comedy

00:46.970 --> 00:48.400
the Dave McGinty Story,

00:48.400 --> 00:50.750
you not only touch on
the deep affect humor has

00:50.750 --> 00:52.320
to the human brain

00:52.320 --> 00:54.910
but also your double life as
a spy for the US government?

00:54.910 --> 00:57.280
- Hey now, that's top secret Becks.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.900
- You have a chapter entitled
Martinis, Bullets and Broads,

00:58.900 --> 01:01.219
My Life as a Spy for the US Government.

01:02.654 --> 01:03.981
- Well you got me on that one.

01:05.421 --> 01:06.254
- Dave!

01:12.550 --> 01:13.700
- Well there lady killer,

01:13.700 --> 01:16.300
can't even keep the fan girls away.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.099
- Wanna take me out for
drinks and hot wings?

01:18.099 --> 01:21.520
- Well, actually my lady,
I have a girlfriend.

01:21.520 --> 01:24.840
- I'm in the mood for mozzarella sticks.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.099
- Uh okay.

01:26.099 --> 01:28.110
- So tell me Dave, why comedy?

01:28.110 --> 01:32.700
- Well Becks, you know, we
think that comedy is all about

01:32.700 --> 01:34.770
having a laugh, couple
jokes here and there,

01:34.770 --> 01:37.950
but the job of a comic, it's really,

01:37.950 --> 01:42.950
it's really about the
stability of an entire society

01:43.220 --> 01:45.450
and really when you get down to it,

01:45.450 --> 01:50.313
it's all that I'm, it's
all that I'm good at.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.383
- And you are good at it.

01:55.620 --> 01:59.103
- Well, yeah, yeah of course.

02:01.140 --> 02:03.997
- So tell me Dave when was
the last time you had sex?

02:05.475 --> 02:07.054
- Excuse me?

02:11.614 --> 02:13.031
What is going on?

02:18.835 --> 02:19.668
No, no, no.

02:21.480 --> 02:22.682
- Oh my God.

02:26.283 --> 02:27.116
Oh my God.

02:29.521 --> 02:31.334
- Oh my, oh.

02:33.962 --> 02:35.883
Oh, those are cute though.

02:53.920 --> 02:54.850
- Hello?

02:54.850 --> 02:57.046
- Dave it's me
Becks, where are you?

02:57.046 --> 02:58.187
- What? Becks?

02:58.187 --> 03:00.100
- You were supposed
to be at the club an hour ago.

03:00.100 --> 03:02.330
But I've been stalling
Byron I can only save him

03:02.330 --> 03:04.890
in the bathroom for so long so if he asks

03:04.890 --> 03:07.390
our story is you gorged yourself
on Applebee's street tacos

03:07.390 --> 03:09.150
last night, get here as soon as possible

03:09.150 --> 03:11.190
and try to look a little dehydrated.

03:11.190 --> 03:13.850
Okay, cool, happy holidays
and get here soon please, bye.

03:13.850 --> 03:14.683
- Okay.

03:18.151 --> 03:20.586
Oh God.

03:34.752 --> 03:36.669
Hitler, Hitler, Hitler.

03:38.149 --> 03:41.316
It's the--

03:47.875 --> 03:50.360
- No, no, no, but for real,

03:50.360 --> 03:53.148
I'll never have a soft boiled egg again.

03:53.148 --> 03:56.170
So, up next is

03:56.170 --> 03:57.870
our old buddy Dave,

03:57.870 --> 03:59.723
everybody give it up for Dave!

04:03.307 --> 04:04.770
- Hey everybody, thank you so much.

04:04.770 --> 04:08.680
So, contrary to popular belief,
the best thing about Hitler

04:08.680 --> 04:11.437
is not his mustache.

04:11.437 --> 04:14.080
But in fact, it is,

04:14.080 --> 04:17.392
it's Eva, Eva Braun, his girlfriend.

04:19.940 --> 04:21.990
Do you think that Hitler
ever actually referred

04:21.990 --> 04:23.980
to Eva Braun as his girlfriend?

04:23.980 --> 04:26.670
I mean, look, he's having a meeting,

04:26.670 --> 04:29.962
he's discussing more efficient methods of

04:29.962 --> 04:34.550
gypsy eradication with
Himmler and Goebbels

04:34.550 --> 04:36.577
and then Eva walks in and he says,

04:36.577 --> 04:39.177
"Hey guys, this is my girlfriend Eva,

04:39.177 --> 04:41.197
"she's a real firecracker.

04:41.197 --> 04:44.667
"She makes a mean spritzkuchen
and she can bend herself

04:44.667 --> 04:47.007
"in half backwards."

04:50.821 --> 04:51.654
Um...

04:52.720 --> 04:56.581
Yeah, so uh, I have a girlfriend.

05:01.136 --> 05:02.810
Well, she can't bend
herself in half backwards,

05:02.810 --> 05:05.510
but she does make a mean streuselkuchen,

05:05.510 --> 05:08.023
if you know what I mean
and I think you do.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.153
So, I was talking about Hitler.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.433
- Bring back Becks!

05:20.433 --> 05:22.530
- So the thing about the Rag Shag fire.

05:22.530 --> 05:25.640
- Alright, so that was
Dave McGinty everybody.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.642
Everyone give it up for Dave.

05:28.475 --> 05:30.960
And of course you know
me, your host Becks.

05:32.790 --> 05:36.310
But seriously folks,
what's with Twitter lately?

05:36.310 --> 05:37.460
Am I right?

05:37.460 --> 05:39.318
I mean, really.

05:40.310 --> 05:42.050
This guy gets it, right?

05:42.050 --> 05:43.300
What kind of name do you have?

05:43.300 --> 05:46.240
Brian? Right?

05:46.240 --> 05:48.380
No but seriously folks,
you guys are great.

05:48.380 --> 05:49.997
Except for you.

05:49.997 --> 05:51.714
What kinda hat is that?

05:51.714 --> 05:53.597
Get that at a hat store?

05:53.597 --> 05:54.754
Sorry, I'm just teasing.

05:54.754 --> 05:55.757
I was kidding.

05:55.757 --> 05:58.178
It's me Becks, it's Becks, right?

05:59.835 --> 06:02.053
Oh, you guys are great.

06:20.420 --> 06:23.010
- Oh, yeah hey, hey Byron, what's up?

06:23.010 --> 06:24.100
- Hey Dave.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.400
You sucked ass balls tonight.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.840
- Ass balls?

06:27.840 --> 06:31.990
- Ya know, ass balls, like ass,

06:31.990 --> 06:35.110
a donkey, you sucked donkey testicles.

06:35.110 --> 06:36.637
- Right.

06:36.637 --> 06:37.620
- So basically normal.

06:37.620 --> 06:39.020
- Great.

06:39.020 --> 06:40.360
- And another thing.

06:40.360 --> 06:43.190
Someone threw up Fireball all
over the women's restroom,

06:43.190 --> 06:44.290
so you gotta clean it up

06:44.290 --> 06:46.914
because Lilly is allergic to cinnamon.

06:46.914 --> 06:49.314
- I'm allergic to cinnamon.

06:49.314 --> 06:52.040
- Um...

06:52.040 --> 06:52.873
Come on Byron.

06:52.873 --> 06:55.580
- Hey, hey, hey, we take
the ADA very seriously here

06:55.580 --> 06:59.090
at Yuks Yuks and not
cleaning up Fireball vomit

06:59.090 --> 07:01.320
is a reasonable accommodation.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.560
So, get accommodated.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.363
- Yes sir, I'll get right to it.

07:06.370 --> 07:07.393
Oh Byron.

07:08.391 --> 07:11.050
I'd like to sign up for the
amateur night on Thursday,

07:11.050 --> 07:12.740
if that's OK.

07:12.740 --> 07:14.423
- Whatever, it's your testicles.

07:27.453 --> 07:28.888
- Hey roomy.

07:28.888 --> 07:31.190
Guess what I did today.

07:31.190 --> 07:32.890
- What did you do, Upchuck?

07:32.890 --> 07:34.070
- I got a pet.

07:34.070 --> 07:35.010
- What? Why?

07:35.010 --> 07:37.586
- It was free. I named him Pubes.

07:37.586 --> 07:39.680
- Doug, have you seen this?

07:39.680 --> 07:40.623
- Oh sweet.

07:41.890 --> 07:43.750
- Um, I don't think Pubes was purchased

07:43.750 --> 07:45.140
from a licensed pet store.

07:45.140 --> 07:47.580
- Hey, you leave Pubes alone.

07:47.580 --> 07:48.623
Took me six hours to catch him.

07:48.623 --> 07:50.471
Didn't it, Pubes?

07:50.471 --> 07:54.231
- David, I feel like we
have more pressing issues

07:54.231 --> 07:56.720
than Upcharles' new rodent.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.080
I noticed you didn't put

07:58.080 --> 08:00.610
your half of the rent in the rent mug.

08:00.610 --> 08:03.470
- Yeah well, I have been
meaning to talk to you

08:03.470 --> 08:04.470
about that actually.

08:05.591 --> 08:07.020
- Whoa, whoa.

08:07.020 --> 08:10.810
Feel like a lot of tension here.

08:10.810 --> 08:12.980
I think I'd like to keep the conversation

08:12.980 --> 08:15.100
a little productive.

08:15.100 --> 08:18.660
Maybe we could use some
I feel statements, OK?

08:18.660 --> 08:20.110
I'll start.

08:20.110 --> 08:25.110
I feel like you didn't
put your half of the rent

08:25.960 --> 08:27.470
in the rent mug.

08:27.470 --> 08:30.600
- Well Doug, I feel that I
shouldn't have to pay half

08:30.600 --> 08:32.470
because Upchuck lives here too.

08:32.470 --> 08:36.100
- Upcharles almost died, David.

08:36.100 --> 08:39.308
He walked right up to
the gaping mall of death,

08:39.308 --> 08:41.852
looked it in the face.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.670
Because of this, he is now disabled.

08:46.670 --> 08:47.640
- I'm disabled.

08:47.640 --> 08:48.810
- He is not!

08:48.810 --> 08:51.610
He's living off a car injury settlement

08:51.610 --> 08:53.830
like some daytime TV loser.

08:53.830 --> 08:55.030
- How dare you.

08:55.030 --> 08:57.629
- Yeah, you play video games all day.

08:57.629 --> 09:00.943
- David, rent bowl,

09:02.220 --> 09:03.053
tomorrow.

09:07.760 --> 09:08.593
Good talk.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.746
- Hey guys, look, Pubes
in my pants playing.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.343
- Hi, my name is Big Tony.

09:35.310 --> 09:37.893
What do you call a pig who does karate?

09:38.830 --> 09:40.589
A pork chop.

09:41.610 --> 09:43.300
Where do they go to dance?

09:43.300 --> 09:44.642
A meat bowl.

09:47.150 --> 09:49.670
- How does he do it?

09:49.670 --> 09:52.880
- So school education falling behind.

09:52.880 --> 09:55.746
Why did student eat homework?

09:55.746 --> 09:57.070
Teacher told him piece of cake.

09:57.070 --> 09:59.820
Did you hear the one
about the rebel's secrets?

09:59.820 --> 10:01.170
- What do you want, Dave?

10:01.170 --> 10:02.030
- Hi Lambkin.

10:03.666 --> 10:06.530
- Lambkin? What is that,
some kind of furry thing?

10:06.530 --> 10:10.790
- Um, it's Shakespeare,
I think, but anyway,

10:10.790 --> 10:11.630
thanks for calling me.

10:11.630 --> 10:15.660
- Well after 37 test
messages, I thought I should.

10:15.660 --> 10:17.900
That's getting a little high maintenance.

10:17.900 --> 10:18.870
- I miss you.

10:18.870 --> 10:20.480
I'm so excited for next weekend.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.230
- What's this weekend?

10:22.230 --> 10:26.300
- I thought, well, you're
driving in from Colorado.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.070
- Oh, uh...

10:28.070 --> 10:30.730
Sorry, I can't come.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.023
Work stuff.

10:32.921 --> 10:34.040
- Hey sweetie, hey baby,

10:34.040 --> 10:34.873
hey sweetie.

10:35.810 --> 10:36.910
I got low blood sugar.

10:39.170 --> 10:40.760
- Who's that?

10:40.760 --> 10:43.290
- That's my brother, Hank.

10:43.290 --> 10:44.123
- You have a brother?

10:44.123 --> 10:46.700
- Yeah, his name is Hank.

10:46.700 --> 10:47.830
- Um...

10:47.830 --> 10:49.421
- Hey baby.

10:49.421 --> 10:50.422
- Just a second.

10:50.422 --> 10:51.420
I'm coming.

10:51.420 --> 10:52.260
- Hi Hank!

10:52.260 --> 10:53.810
- Dave, I gotta go but,

10:53.810 --> 10:56.060
hey, I'm getting my head
shots redone this month,

10:56.060 --> 10:58.208
so I'm gonna need an extra 100 from you.

10:58.208 --> 10:59.930
- OK.

10:59.930 --> 11:01.170
- Love you, Dave.

11:01.170 --> 11:04.910
You're the kindest, warmest, bravest,

11:04.910 --> 11:07.210
most wonderful human being I've ever known

11:07.210 --> 11:08.653
in my life, bye!

11:21.480 --> 11:23.883
- So, before my cousin got disappeared,

11:25.350 --> 11:27.467
he played tennis like this.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.022
- Hi Becks! Here.

11:37.022 --> 11:38.050
- Hi Dave.

11:38.050 --> 11:39.820
- Hey listen, I've got a few ideas.

11:39.820 --> 11:41.680
I was hoping I could
workshop those with you.

11:41.680 --> 11:42.513
- Sure.

11:44.342 --> 11:47.140
- OK so, I've been meaning
to make some changes

11:47.140 --> 11:49.520
to my Hitler routine.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.710
Didn't really get as many
laughs as I wanted last night.

11:51.710 --> 11:52.853
- I can't imagine why.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.520
- Uh yeah, I've been
doing some research about

11:56.520 --> 11:57.400
Eva Braun Hitler.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.380
They had a dog!

11:58.380 --> 12:01.160
- I'm not sure expanding
the Hitler bit is the way

12:01.160 --> 12:03.160
to go, Dave.

12:03.160 --> 12:06.070
- Becks, there's four pillars of comedy.

12:06.070 --> 12:10.023
Slapstick, farce, satire,
and then ya got Hitler.

12:11.039 --> 12:14.760
- While there's a case to be made, Dave,

12:14.760 --> 12:16.900
you need to relax, forget the Hitler bit,

12:16.900 --> 12:19.904
gettin' too intense, relax.

12:19.904 --> 12:20.740
- Yeah, OK.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.083
OK, I'll just relax.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.870
Just gotta relax, just relax!

12:24.870 --> 12:27.130
I just gotta relax, right?
- Dear God, short circuit.

12:27.130 --> 12:28.240
- You're gonna overheat.

12:28.240 --> 12:32.523
Listen! Humor is not a
science, it's an art.

12:32.523 --> 12:35.410
It comes from uh...

12:45.290 --> 12:46.123
within.

12:47.270 --> 12:50.450
- Yeah OK, says the girl
who won Hayesville's

12:50.450 --> 12:53.140
Little Miss Charmer Pageant by accident

12:53.140 --> 12:55.661
when she got lost at the carnival

12:55.661 --> 12:56.840
and just wandered on stage.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.600
Ya know, your midichlorian
count is off the chart.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.330
I don't have the gifts that you have.

13:01.330 --> 13:03.003
- I put the work in.

13:03.003 --> 13:03.903
I do.
- OK, sure.

13:07.040 --> 13:07.873
- Who was that?

13:07.873 --> 13:09.600
- Bethany, no, Brenda!

13:09.600 --> 13:11.263
Uh, Bethany, definitely Bethany.

13:12.570 --> 13:15.070
- OK, I thought you
didn't go out last night.

13:15.070 --> 13:16.641
- We met at Wal-Mart.

13:16.641 --> 13:17.558
- Wal-Mart?

13:21.800 --> 13:24.100
- So, are you a famous comedian too?

13:24.100 --> 13:28.210
- Oh yeah, well no, I'm Dave.

13:28.210 --> 13:29.980
- Dave is struggling with his act

13:29.980 --> 13:32.020
and came over for some advice.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.409
- OK, I wouldn't say struggling.

13:34.409 --> 13:36.490
- Hey, I have a joke for your failing act.

13:36.490 --> 13:38.120
Do you wanna hear it?

13:38.120 --> 13:39.500
- Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.010
- So, when I was in
college, I was in a band

13:42.010 --> 13:45.326
and it was called The
Hermeneutic of Discontinuity,

13:45.326 --> 13:48.185
but we had to change it to
The Hermeneutic of Continuity

13:48.185 --> 13:52.043
because the other way was
like, way too depressing.

13:55.049 --> 13:56.190
- I don't get it.

13:56.190 --> 13:57.090
- What's a Hermeneutic?

13:57.090 --> 13:59.040
- So, a Hermeneutic is a systematic way

13:59.040 --> 14:00.260
of looking at things.

14:00.260 --> 14:02.780
See, there's like two
different schools of thought

14:02.780 --> 14:04.670
when it comes to the
history of the church.

14:04.670 --> 14:07.720
One, that the traditions
have continued unchanged

14:07.720 --> 14:10.380
from the beginning to
now and the other is that

14:10.380 --> 14:12.601
at some point, there was
a break in continuity

14:12.601 --> 14:15.710
and so the church was lost along the way,

14:15.710 --> 14:19.800
so you can see why it's
funny and depressing.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.240
- Uh yeah, OK.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.730
- I guess it's a theologians joke.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.210
It was funny in seminary.

14:26.210 --> 14:27.043
- I love it.

14:27.043 --> 14:28.497
- So wait, what do you do?

14:28.497 --> 14:30.320
- I'm a youth minister.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.153
- Really?

14:31.153 --> 14:33.065
- Unitarian, Dave.

14:33.065 --> 14:35.443
- Yeah, yeah, that makes more sense.

14:35.443 --> 14:36.610
- And boy, was I converted last night!

14:36.610 --> 14:38.920
Creature in the streets, sinner
in the sheets, am I right?

14:38.920 --> 14:40.910
- More like Monophysite in the streets

14:40.910 --> 14:42.900
and Abyssinia in the sheets.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.010
- Sure.

14:44.010 --> 14:48.500
Dave here is also having trouble
in the romance department.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.530
- Becks.

14:49.530 --> 14:52.780
- Dave, it's OK if you have a small penis.

14:52.780 --> 14:53.613
It really is.

14:53.613 --> 14:56.730
I once rode a beenie weenie like a cowgirl

14:56.730 --> 14:58.601
all the way into the sunset.

14:58.601 --> 14:59.822
- Yeehaw!

14:59.822 --> 15:01.542
- No, listen, I don't have a, that--

15:01.542 --> 15:03.840
- Nah, he just has a lousy
long distance girlfriend

15:03.840 --> 15:07.240
who thinks Skype sex is porn-y.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.680
She also says old timers
instead of Alzheimer's.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.140
- OK, she did that twice.

15:11.140 --> 15:12.570
- One was at your grandmother's funeral.

15:12.570 --> 15:14.870
- Yeah, it was appropriate in context.

15:14.870 --> 15:17.280
- She also says that
bopping the bologna is the

15:17.280 --> 15:19.320
same thing as cheating, so
Dave here has been living

15:19.320 --> 15:21.440
like a Mormon missionary
for the past six months.

15:21.440 --> 15:23.830
I caught him caressing a
Mrs. Butterworth bottle

15:23.830 --> 15:26.320
in a very suggestive way the other day.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.850
It made an awkward breakfast.

15:27.850 --> 15:31.530
- OK, you know that I have a

15:31.530 --> 15:34.150
deep affection for maple syrup.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.230
- Who doesn't?

15:35.230 --> 15:36.406
- Dave,

15:36.406 --> 15:38.960
remember when you were five years old

15:38.960 --> 15:40.830
and you'd play naked in the sandbox?

15:40.830 --> 15:44.770
You got that grain of sand
lodged in your wee wee?

15:44.770 --> 15:47.340
- Yeah, I remember.

15:47.340 --> 15:49.590
I wish you wouldn't talk
about that so often.

15:49.590 --> 15:52.140
- Remember how your wee wee hurt so bad

15:52.140 --> 15:53.700
but you didn't wanna tell your Mom?

15:53.700 --> 15:55.160
You remember that, Dave?

15:55.160 --> 15:56.340
- Yeah.

15:56.340 --> 15:58.660
Can you stop saying wee wee?

15:58.660 --> 16:00.130
- And remember what I said?

16:00.130 --> 16:02.567
I said, "Dave, you gotta tell your Mom

16:02.567 --> 16:04.187
"about the sand in your wee wee

16:04.187 --> 16:05.800
"so the doctor can get it out."

16:05.800 --> 16:07.460
Remember that Dave?

16:07.460 --> 16:08.650
- Yeah.

16:08.650 --> 16:10.410
- And what happened?
You listened to me.

16:10.410 --> 16:11.680
You listened to my advice.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.380
And the doctor fixed your wee wee.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.330
- Is there a point to this story?

16:16.330 --> 16:19.010
- The point is, Dave, that since that day,

16:19.010 --> 16:22.880
I have developed a sense
of personal responsibility

16:22.880 --> 16:25.898
for the well-being of your wee wee.

16:25.898 --> 16:28.260
- You know, we adult males
prefer the term penis.

16:28.260 --> 16:32.371
- Well, sorry, I'm protective
of your penis, Dave,

16:32.371 --> 16:35.670
but I think Sarah is bad
for the little fella.

16:35.670 --> 16:38.510
There, I've said it and I'd say it again.

16:38.510 --> 16:42.240
I mean, you can't even fly
the bishop occasionally.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.559
I mean, come on, I'm at a loss for words.

16:44.559 --> 16:49.060
- Oh jeez, you know, I
know you look out for me

16:49.060 --> 16:51.195
and you always have, but,

16:51.195 --> 16:56.040
Sarah is just so far out of my league

16:56.040 --> 17:00.140
and ya know, I know she's a
little moody sometimes but,

17:00.140 --> 17:01.720
isn't that how all women are?

17:01.720 --> 17:03.470
- Shrieking banshees?

17:03.470 --> 17:05.569
- You know, sometimes,
I do wail outside of

17:05.569 --> 17:07.250
Mrs. Fernelli's apartment.

17:07.250 --> 17:09.310
Sorry, that's completely unrelated.

17:09.310 --> 17:11.109
You know, girls just wanna have fun.

17:11.970 --> 17:13.358
- This Red Bull?

17:13.358 --> 17:14.510
- Yeah.

17:14.510 --> 17:15.960
- Shots, shots, shots!

17:17.978 --> 17:20.023
It's so cool that Yuk's
let you take home alcohol.

17:20.023 --> 17:23.981
- I love bachelor parties!

17:23.981 --> 17:25.064
Perrier, woo!

17:25.920 --> 17:28.069
- Me too, I can't wait
til we go to the bar.

17:28.069 --> 17:31.101
Hey, I made cinnamon toast friend shots.

17:31.101 --> 17:35.290
- I'm allergic to cinnamon.

17:35.290 --> 17:37.993
I could sue you for attempting murder.

17:38.878 --> 17:41.362
- I would not attempt murder, my bestie!

17:41.362 --> 17:42.445
How dare you!

17:43.576 --> 17:45.821
- So sorry I'm late.

17:45.821 --> 17:47.440
- Allison!

17:47.440 --> 17:49.370
- It's Lilly's turn to
be married this week.

17:49.370 --> 17:51.130
- I'm marrying a Hungarian prince

17:51.130 --> 17:53.700
and I'm looking for one last fling.

17:53.700 --> 17:54.763
Bring on the boys!

17:56.381 --> 17:57.380
Sit down, biatch.

17:58.710 --> 18:01.497
- Um, sure biatch,

18:01.497 --> 18:04.300
but I have to use the
little girls room first.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.650
Do you have any ginger ale?

18:08.040 --> 18:09.950
Or a shot of 151?

18:09.950 --> 18:11.000
- Yes!
- Yes, bitch!

18:16.270 --> 18:18.980
- Just looking at her breaks my heart.

18:18.980 --> 18:21.210
- It's not her fault she looks so homely.

18:21.210 --> 18:25.550
It's bad genetics and
the wrathful hand of God.

18:25.550 --> 18:28.270
- Oh, I mean, it's been
almost exactly one year

18:28.270 --> 18:29.770
since the incident.

18:29.770 --> 18:31.080
- Oh my gee, what incident?

18:31.080 --> 18:34.130
- So, she told me her
boyfriend broke up with her

18:34.130 --> 18:37.240
last Christmas and immediately
was gorged to death

18:37.240 --> 18:38.773
by an escaped bull.

18:39.610 --> 18:40.930
- Oh my God.

18:40.930 --> 18:42.340
Why'd he break up with her?

18:42.340 --> 18:44.740
I mean, besides the obvious?

18:44.740 --> 18:47.759
- I guess being average looking
on the inside isn't enough.

18:47.759 --> 18:51.680
For some people, it is, mostly poors.

18:51.680 --> 18:55.180
- It's not their fault, poor filthy saps.

19:00.984 --> 19:01.817
You know her cat, Cocoa?

19:01.817 --> 19:03.160
- So cute.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.722
- He's not even rescued.

19:05.555 --> 19:07.090
- That's an offense equal to genocide!

19:07.090 --> 19:08.275
- I know.

19:08.275 --> 19:09.108
So cute.

19:09.108 --> 19:09.941
- So cute.

19:09.941 --> 19:10.838
- So cute.

19:10.838 --> 19:12.550
- Tell Brian he has to
move back the deadline.

19:12.550 --> 19:14.780
I'm really onto something
now and I think these girls

19:14.780 --> 19:17.330
have finally accepted
me as one of their own.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.883
I need more time.

19:20.396 --> 19:23.600
Ugh, it's Allison!

19:23.600 --> 19:25.660
Put me in your contacts!

19:25.660 --> 19:28.000
- I just feel so bad.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.273
People being alone and unattractive.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.160
- What can we do, Jane?

19:32.160 --> 19:34.719
I mean, we're not magic.

19:34.719 --> 19:38.230
- Lilly! We could get her
a Christmas boyfriend!

19:38.230 --> 19:39.940
- Oh em gee, I've been
trying to break into

19:39.940 --> 19:42.440
charity work for so long,
but every time I go down

19:42.440 --> 19:45.300
to the soup kitchen, it's
like hella surrounded

19:45.300 --> 19:46.510
by homeless people.

19:46.510 --> 19:47.870
- That's exactly what she needs,

19:47.870 --> 19:50.060
a pure connection with
another human being.

19:50.060 --> 19:52.504
- What? She needs dick?

19:52.504 --> 19:56.070
A big old honkin' johnson?

19:56.070 --> 19:57.690
- Size doesn't matter.

19:57.690 --> 20:01.464
What matters is bad vision
and a lack of self respect.

20:01.464 --> 20:03.803
- I bet.

20:04.880 --> 20:05.973
I bet!

20:07.590 --> 20:09.030
That's fire.

20:09.030 --> 20:11.813
Belinda's pool party is gonna be fire.

20:28.900 --> 20:32.223
- So, anybody in here watch Judge Judy?

20:33.200 --> 20:34.580
What about you?

20:34.580 --> 20:36.381
You look divorced.

20:39.434 --> 20:41.300
- Oh hey, Sarah.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.910
Make your good lucks
and break a legs quick.

20:42.910 --> 20:44.970
I'm going on stage in a couple minutes.

20:44.970 --> 20:48.540
- You're charging me $50
as a consultation fee

20:48.540 --> 20:50.230
just to taste the cake?

20:50.230 --> 20:52.780
You realize I'm going to
buy an entire cake from you

20:52.780 --> 20:54.880
and I still have to pay just to decide

20:54.880 --> 20:56.383
which shitty cake I want?

20:57.670 --> 20:58.503
- Sarah?

20:58.503 --> 21:00.530
- Dave, hey, I have to make this quick.

21:00.530 --> 21:01.363
Two things.

21:01.363 --> 21:03.410
First, I changed the Netflix password.

21:03.410 --> 21:05.510
I just don't like the
idea of you being able

21:05.510 --> 21:07.600
to see every single movie that I watch.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.170
It feels like an invasion of privacy.

21:10.170 --> 21:11.810
- You changed my Netflix password?

21:11.810 --> 21:15.850
- Second, I think we
should stop doing this.

21:15.850 --> 21:17.030
- This?

21:17.030 --> 21:17.903
- Dating?

21:19.279 --> 21:22.320
- Well, I don't--

21:22.320 --> 21:24.420
- I'm breaking up with you, Dave.

21:24.420 --> 21:26.770
I think we should start
seeing and sleeping

21:26.770 --> 21:29.114
with other people, well I will.

21:29.114 --> 21:33.620
You can keep doing your
dungeons and dalmations.

21:33.620 --> 21:36.610
- But darling, sugar,

21:36.610 --> 21:39.150
sweet stuff, happy dust--

21:39.150 --> 21:41.590
- You're just using
other words for cocaine.

21:41.590 --> 21:43.590
- You're my cocaine, I love you!

21:43.590 --> 21:45.720
- Ugh, gross.

21:45.720 --> 21:48.650
Dave, I'm a lady, and
when someone comes around

21:48.650 --> 21:52.480
and puts a $10,000 hunk
of rock on my finger,

21:52.480 --> 21:55.343
I don't exactly need my minute
man from Kansas anymore.

21:57.213 --> 21:58.800
- Wow, that's beautiful.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.410
Did your Gaga leave that for you?

22:00.410 --> 22:01.990
- Red velvet.

22:01.990 --> 22:03.610
It's chocolate with food coloring.

22:03.610 --> 22:06.150
It's not that hard to figure out.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.217
- Oh, you look beautiful baby.

22:08.217 --> 22:10.173
- Thanks baby.

22:11.380 --> 22:12.870
- Hank?

22:12.870 --> 22:15.210
Wait, are you marrying your brother?

22:15.210 --> 22:16.970
Is that even legal in Colorado?

22:16.970 --> 22:19.310
- Anyway, thanks for everything, Dave.

22:19.310 --> 22:22.020
Never call me again.

22:22.020 --> 22:23.840
- Well, maybe we can talk through this.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.094
- Goodbye Dave.

22:32.620 --> 22:35.978
- So, you ever like, put on a turtleneck

22:35.978 --> 22:37.413
and you're like, damn it!

22:40.717 --> 22:43.470
Alright, that's the end
of my set, everybody.

22:43.470 --> 22:44.700
I'm Becks.

22:44.700 --> 22:48.058
Up next is our old buddy Dave.

22:52.190 --> 22:55.003
- So uh, Hitler.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.610
You know, the best thing about
Hitler wasn't his mustache,

22:58.610 --> 23:01.003
but his girlfriend.

23:02.197 --> 23:04.507
You ever think Hitler was like,

23:04.507 --> 23:07.417
"Hey guys, this is my girlfriend Eva.

23:07.417 --> 23:12.027
"She can bend really, really far."

23:12.960 --> 23:14.413
They had a dog.

23:25.950 --> 23:28.970
So, I was in a band in college.

23:28.970 --> 23:31.460
We were called the
Hermeneutic of Discontinuity

23:31.460 --> 23:33.920
and then we changed it to
the Hermeneutic of Continuity

23:33.920 --> 23:37.130
because we thought the other
one was just too depressing.

23:37.130 --> 23:37.963
- What?

23:38.980 --> 23:40.420
- Um, well, you see,

23:40.420 --> 23:43.600
there's two things in the church history.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.210
- What is happening?

23:45.210 --> 23:46.340
- Get off the stage!

23:46.340 --> 23:49.210
- Oh, like you're so funny!

23:49.210 --> 23:50.590
Who's that?

23:50.590 --> 23:52.140
Oh let me guess, it's your sister?

23:52.140 --> 23:53.700
You guys should move to Colorado.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.270
- Can I top you off?

23:55.270 --> 23:57.130
- No, you may not take your top off!

23:57.130 --> 23:59.380
I'm sorry, I misheard you.

23:59.380 --> 24:01.860
Uh, don't let me interrupt.

24:01.860 --> 24:06.860
I don't wanna stop you from
doing what makes you happy.

24:08.620 --> 24:13.065
So, go pour your drinks, carry your trays,

24:13.065 --> 24:17.397
go have sex with Hank
in Boulder, Colorado.

24:17.397 --> 24:19.580
- What do you got against Colorado?

24:19.580 --> 24:22.250
- Well Edith, oh, may I call you Edith?

24:22.250 --> 24:24.975
What I have against
Colorado is that it is the

24:24.975 --> 24:29.975
flaky scab of the whole United States.

24:30.110 --> 24:34.175
It is where evil people
live and where relationships

24:34.175 --> 24:36.317
go to die!

24:42.715 --> 24:44.490
- I don't really write any of my sets.

24:44.490 --> 24:47.050
I think they're just
coming and I don't know

24:47.050 --> 24:48.690
how I do it, really.

24:48.690 --> 24:50.623
- That is so cool.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.810
- You know, I'm having a
Christmas party this Friday.

24:53.810 --> 24:55.523
You should totally come.

24:55.523 --> 24:57.140
- A Christmas party?

24:57.140 --> 25:00.030
I make a really great homemade eggnog with

25:00.030 --> 25:02.480
yak's milk and hand ground cinnamon.

25:02.480 --> 25:05.860
- That sounds great Byron, you
should email me the recipe.

25:05.860 --> 25:07.030
- Did you see my set?

25:07.030 --> 25:09.650
- Uh no, I was talking to Ariella here.

25:09.650 --> 25:12.410
- It was the worst five
minutes of my entire life.

25:12.410 --> 25:13.490
It was terrible.

25:13.490 --> 25:15.660
Well, it was the second worst.

25:15.660 --> 25:18.370
- Dave, I've just been informed
that that elderly patron

25:18.370 --> 25:20.500
whose business you were all up in,

25:20.500 --> 25:22.920
well we will never be
getting her business again.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.309
You wanna know why?

25:24.309 --> 25:27.510
- Because she complained and stormed out.

25:27.510 --> 25:29.330
She's mad?

25:29.330 --> 25:31.750
- No, she's dead, Dave.

25:31.750 --> 25:33.180
Heart attack.

25:33.180 --> 25:35.072
You're fired.

25:35.072 --> 25:36.830
- Byron!

25:36.830 --> 25:41.010
- But before you go, I need
you to scrape the tampons

25:41.010 --> 25:42.623
off the ladies restroom walls.

25:44.780 --> 25:46.510
- I deserve that.

25:46.510 --> 25:47.860
- See you in two.

25:49.070 --> 25:49.903
- Dave!

26:32.210 --> 26:34.690
- Wearing a hole in my floor
will not make life any better.

26:34.690 --> 26:36.110
- What life?

26:36.110 --> 26:36.943
Ya know?

26:36.943 --> 26:39.923
Everything has turned to dust.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.690
Hey, do you have any sackcloth?

26:43.690 --> 26:45.610
You know, they're always
talking about sackcloth

26:45.610 --> 26:46.747
in the nasty bits of the bible?

26:46.747 --> 26:48.090
- Ew, you read the bible?

26:48.090 --> 26:48.923
- Yeah.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.640
- Oh, this is Brandy.

26:57.640 --> 26:58.473
- Brittney.

26:58.473 --> 26:59.860
- Brittney, we met last night.

26:59.860 --> 27:01.730
She was dumpster diving
behind my whole booth.

27:01.730 --> 27:03.337
- Jesus!

27:03.337 --> 27:04.358
- Don't be a dick.

27:04.358 --> 27:06.179
- I am having an existential
crisis right now.

27:06.179 --> 27:07.720
You know, I need some council.

27:07.720 --> 27:08.553
Becks.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.290
- Whatever you can say to me,

27:11.290 --> 27:13.256
you can say in front of Bettany.

27:13.256 --> 27:14.910
- Brittney.

27:14.910 --> 27:17.870
- Brittney, so let's start
wrestling with your issues.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.120
What is it that you need, Dave?

27:19.120 --> 27:22.579
- Well, first of all, a less
sympathetic ear, ya know?

27:22.579 --> 27:25.459
Maybe a little human intimacy?

27:25.459 --> 27:27.760
Someone to make a connection with?

27:27.760 --> 27:29.150
- You need to get laid.

27:29.150 --> 27:31.030
- No, it's more than that.

27:31.030 --> 27:34.020
- You need a kickstart to
get you outta this slump.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.100
- You need an existential
blow to your loins.

27:36.100 --> 27:37.490
- You need a girlfriend.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.870
- No, no, I'm terrible
at talking to girls.

27:39.870 --> 27:41.690
You know the only reason
I chatted up Sarah

27:41.690 --> 27:43.360
was because we were
trapped in an elevator.

27:43.360 --> 27:44.600
- Well that's it then.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.558
We can just disable an elevator.

27:46.558 --> 27:49.250
Or we could have a party.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.760
- That's it, my Christmas party.

27:50.760 --> 27:53.410
I can simply lose any
invitation that isn't for a

27:53.410 --> 27:56.290
conventionally attractive
young woman with loose morals.

27:56.290 --> 27:57.440
- You're a Gemini right?

27:57.440 --> 27:59.459
- I think so.

27:59.459 --> 28:00.377
How do you know that?

28:00.377 --> 28:02.020
- Ah, this is perfect.

28:02.020 --> 28:03.880
You have to have this
party tomorrow night.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.350
The stars will be aligned.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.740
Engage in coitous as the
midnight hour strikes.

28:07.740 --> 28:08.730
- Tomorrow night?

28:08.730 --> 28:11.130
I need a little more time to heal.

28:11.130 --> 28:13.800
Ya know, I'm not exactly Ric
Flair in the wooing department.

28:13.800 --> 28:15.620
- There's gonna be alcohol there, Dave.

28:15.620 --> 28:17.030
Everyone's more charming
after a couple drinks.

28:17.030 --> 28:19.760
Bring that VHS of the Russian comedian guy

28:19.760 --> 28:20.860
that you're in love with.

28:20.860 --> 28:23.360
- I'm terrible at parties
and it's the last known

28:23.360 --> 28:24.840
recording of him in existence.

28:24.840 --> 28:27.960
So I don't really just whip
it out all willy nilly.

28:27.960 --> 28:28.870
- Come to the party, Dave.

28:28.870 --> 28:29.703
Drink a little.

28:30.659 --> 28:32.393
You'll have some fun and if
you meet the love of your life

28:32.393 --> 28:33.690
and make me the best
woman at your wedding,

28:33.690 --> 28:34.949
this is a plus.

28:34.949 --> 28:36.680
- It takes me hours to get comfortable.

28:36.680 --> 28:38.740
I forget how to stand.

28:38.740 --> 28:40.410
I just ugh, I can't.

28:40.410 --> 28:42.520
- You need to let loose, alright?

28:42.520 --> 28:43.503
You're too careful.

28:44.430 --> 28:45.566
You play it too safe.

28:45.566 --> 28:46.420
You need to wake up
naked in the Home Depot

28:46.420 --> 28:47.860
parking lot covered in mustard.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.240
- Been there.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.073
- Thanks.

28:50.920 --> 28:51.780
- You're coming and you're bringing

28:51.780 --> 28:52.870
your best quips with you.

28:52.870 --> 28:55.370
You're smart, funny,
handsome, you can recite

28:55.370 --> 28:56.630
all of Ghostbusters by heart.

28:56.630 --> 28:58.590
- Yeah, do you think
my photographic memory

28:58.590 --> 29:00.450
will help me win some ladies?

29:00.450 --> 29:01.860
- It has to eventually, right?

29:01.860 --> 29:03.620
Come to the party Dave.

29:03.620 --> 29:04.453
- I don't know, I'll think about it.

29:04.453 --> 29:05.286
- You'll do it!

29:05.286 --> 29:07.603
- Fine, let me go so I
can go to the bathroom.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.421
- I have a plan, slightly extreme.

29:13.421 --> 29:15.460
- This man needs an extreme plan.

29:15.460 --> 29:17.170
- Our goal is to keep the maximum number

29:17.170 --> 29:19.230
of supple young women with
promiscuous tendencies

29:19.230 --> 29:21.840
at this party location
for as long as possible.

29:21.840 --> 29:25.220
To do this, we one, we move your car,

29:25.220 --> 29:27.200
take it to the mall, say it's at the shop.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.120
We cannot have an
alternative means of escape.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.640
- We can do a sweet
and roll over the hood.

29:30.640 --> 29:33.030
- Two, cut off all the
communication the cell phone.

29:33.030 --> 29:34.418
I'll bring mine from home.

29:34.418 --> 29:37.282
Three, we disable any
means of transportation.

29:37.282 --> 29:39.580
While you distract them
with an engaging tale

29:39.580 --> 29:41.260
of misadventure, I'll sneak out

29:41.260 --> 29:42.770
and render their cars non-functional.

29:42.770 --> 29:45.098
- We can make out in the back seat.

29:46.510 --> 29:49.290
- Four, ensure the weather is inhospitable

29:49.290 --> 29:50.230
for them to walk out.

29:50.230 --> 29:52.238
I'll use my cult knowledge

29:52.238 --> 29:53.360
to summon the snow goddess, Chione.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.340
Five, Dave uses his latent charms

29:55.340 --> 29:56.770
and best quips to get the girl

29:56.770 --> 29:58.063
and fulfill his destiny.

29:58.999 --> 29:59.999
- I like it.

30:05.410 --> 30:07.520
- So, what's up?

30:07.520 --> 30:09.730
- Nothing, the party of your life.

30:09.730 --> 30:11.020
I gotta make some calls.

30:11.020 --> 30:12.573
- You didn't wash your hands.

30:13.990 --> 30:14.823
- Sorry.

30:43.912 --> 30:45.010
- I feel like I've been scraped

30:45.010 --> 30:46.920
at the bottom of a shit farm.

30:49.021 --> 30:50.940
- I just don't understand.

30:50.940 --> 30:54.450
I called 37 guys last night.

30:54.450 --> 30:57.110
None of them will take Allison out.

30:57.110 --> 30:59.507
I've tried Tindr, Grinder, Snapchat,

31:01.357 --> 31:06.357
OK Cupid, Eharmony, FarmersOnly.com.

31:07.890 --> 31:10.280
- I called all my ex boyfriends,

31:10.280 --> 31:12.390
all of my old teachers,

31:12.390 --> 31:15.080
that one blind guy,

31:15.080 --> 31:18.120
and nothing, no luck.

31:18.120 --> 31:20.621
- We need a miracle.

31:22.960 --> 31:23.793
- Hello?

31:24.700 --> 31:25.590
Hello?

31:25.590 --> 31:27.079
- Lilly!

31:27.079 --> 31:27.912
- Oh, hi Becks, what's up?

31:27.912 --> 31:28.760
- Lilly, I need you.

31:28.760 --> 31:31.190
- Well, it's always fun
to check different waters

31:31.190 --> 31:32.480
from time to time.

31:32.480 --> 31:33.890
When do you want me over?

31:33.890 --> 31:35.477
- Well that's excellent
information to know,

31:35.477 --> 31:38.410
but the purpose of my call
entails your long list

31:38.410 --> 31:40.621
of cute straight girl contacts.

31:40.621 --> 31:41.677
- What?

31:41.677 --> 31:42.620
- I'm having a party tomorrow night.

31:42.620 --> 31:44.550
You and your friends can come.

31:44.550 --> 31:48.340
- Becks, you know how
I feel about parties.

31:48.340 --> 31:49.837
- Right, you know how to party.

31:49.837 --> 31:51.050
You know, they still
haven't found that guy?

31:51.050 --> 31:52.660
Anyway, I know this is last minute,

31:52.660 --> 31:54.080
but do you think you can
round up some cute girls

31:54.080 --> 31:55.070
for tomorrow night?

31:55.070 --> 31:57.441
I got over-excited and ordered
over $100 of smoked salmon,

31:57.441 --> 31:59.681
so the date's pretty set.

31:59.681 --> 32:03.170
- Well that sounds really fun and all.

32:03.170 --> 32:06.870
Is this gonna be an
Ellen and Portia party?

32:06.870 --> 32:07.703
- A what now?

32:07.703 --> 32:10.230
- Are we gonna be listening
to Tegan and Sara?

32:10.230 --> 32:13.970
Would Kristen Stewart feel at home there?

32:13.970 --> 32:15.743
- I don't understand.

32:16.817 --> 32:19.530
- Is this going to be a matoesque soiree?

32:19.530 --> 32:20.363
- Huh?

32:20.363 --> 32:23.860
- Will there be dicks there, biatch?

32:23.860 --> 32:25.360
- Oh yes!

32:25.360 --> 32:27.720
Buckets of cute boys!

32:27.720 --> 32:29.210
- That sounds like so much fun.

32:29.210 --> 32:32.220
Is it OK if I invite my ugly friend?

32:32.220 --> 32:33.823
- Sure, but not too many.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.253
- Sounds great!

32:44.260 --> 32:45.910
- This is gonna be a great party.

32:47.140 --> 32:48.670
And now Ted, my ex-wife is trying her hand

32:48.670 --> 32:49.780
at being a standup comedian.

32:49.780 --> 32:51.030
So speaking of things that aren't funny,

32:51.030 --> 32:53.230
this snow is certainly ruining
a lot of commuter's day.

32:53.230 --> 32:56.059
Recorded snowfall is
blanketed throughout the area.

33:52.260 --> 33:53.393
- I brought egg salad.

33:54.470 --> 33:55.630
- Right, it's almost party time.

33:55.630 --> 33:57.020
We feeling ready, feeling good?

33:57.020 --> 33:58.720
- Yeah, I'm ready, I guess.

33:58.720 --> 33:59.650
- I have all my supplies.

33:59.650 --> 34:01.280
Should we synchronize our watches?

34:01.280 --> 34:02.113
- What are you talking about?

34:02.113 --> 34:03.170
- She means party supplies.

34:03.170 --> 34:05.550
You know, corn chips, alcohol,
Barry Manilow records,

34:05.550 --> 34:06.510
the works.

34:06.510 --> 34:07.610
- Whose house is this?

34:07.610 --> 34:08.550
Is this your house, Brittney?

34:08.550 --> 34:09.966
- It is now.

34:09.966 --> 34:10.799
- That's not important Dave.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.449
What's important is that
we have a good time,

34:12.449 --> 34:14.620
cray it up, as I think
the young people say.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.350
This is exactly what you need.

34:16.350 --> 34:18.525
And honestly, the less we know,

34:18.525 --> 34:20.170
the less our legal liability.

34:20.170 --> 34:21.130
- Becks.

34:21.130 --> 34:22.489
- This is what you need and
I'm gonna give it to you

34:22.489 --> 34:23.755
good and hard.

34:23.755 --> 34:24.830
You take it like a man
who takes things well.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.420
Do things that are legal in every state.

34:26.420 --> 34:28.909
Chug a bottle of sangria,
jaywalk, kick a baby,

34:28.909 --> 34:31.350
kick out a jams tonight,
you need to live it!

34:31.350 --> 34:32.820
Say it with me, I need to live it!

34:32.820 --> 34:34.605
- I need to live it.

34:34.605 --> 34:35.889
- I need to live it!

34:35.889 --> 34:37.141
- I will live it.

34:37.141 --> 34:38.147
- Live it!

34:38.147 --> 34:39.143
- I have to live it.

34:39.143 --> 34:39.976
- Live it!

34:39.976 --> 34:40.810
- Live it!

34:40.810 --> 34:41.643
- Live it.

34:41.643 --> 34:42.476
- Kill it!

34:42.476 --> 34:43.833
Like millennials are killing Applebee's.

34:44.666 --> 34:45.909
- OK quiet, we don't want
them to think we're crazy.

34:45.909 --> 34:48.899
- Remember Dave, the
labe is a jealous God.

34:48.899 --> 34:49.896
- The what?

34:49.896 --> 34:51.228
- A jealous God.

34:53.353 --> 34:54.670
- Who said jager bombs?

34:54.670 --> 34:55.810
- You invited Upchuck?

34:55.810 --> 34:57.240
- I love this guy!

34:57.240 --> 34:58.073
- Ho ho ho, my dude.

34:58.073 --> 34:59.130
- How are you feeling?

34:59.130 --> 35:01.574
- I'm on a strict diet of Percocet,

35:01.574 --> 35:04.800
Red Bull, and Bartons, a lot of Bartons.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.120
- Well, thank you for at
least wearing a shirt.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.797
- Thanks, it's my sisters.

35:08.797 --> 35:10.197
I think it fits pretty nice.

35:14.536 --> 35:15.369
- Hey!

35:17.447 --> 35:20.310
- Jane, I haven't seen you since well,

35:20.310 --> 35:21.143
on the news.

35:21.143 --> 35:23.220
- That explosion was not my fault.

35:23.220 --> 35:25.576
We were trying to invent
a new self-baking bread.

35:25.576 --> 35:28.530
Thomas Edison wasn't
appreciated in his time either.

35:28.530 --> 35:30.830
- Right, so introductions,

35:30.830 --> 35:31.910
Dave, Brittney.

35:31.910 --> 35:33.190
- Brittney.

35:33.190 --> 35:35.430
Oh wait yes, Brittney, Brittney.

35:35.430 --> 35:36.370
- Brittney.

35:36.370 --> 35:37.870
Lilly, you know Dave from the club.

35:37.870 --> 35:39.380
And this is Jane.

35:39.380 --> 35:41.120
- Sorry, hello.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.533
- And Allison.

35:44.250 --> 35:47.090
- Right so, I got 38 bottles of

35:47.090 --> 35:49.200
gin, rum, vodka and Fireball.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.890
Let's get drunk!

35:50.890 --> 35:53.610
- You keep that cinnamon
cyanide away from me, ya hear?

35:53.610 --> 35:54.523
- Jesus!

35:55.629 --> 35:56.462
- Party!

35:59.036 --> 36:00.090
- So, you're a comedian?

36:00.090 --> 36:02.310
- Yeah, dishwasher by day.

36:02.310 --> 36:03.570
- What does that entail?

36:03.570 --> 36:08.570
- Well, it's ya know,
gathering the dishes,

36:08.750 --> 36:10.970
rinsing the dishes, taking the dishes

36:10.970 --> 36:12.750
and putting them in the dishwasher.

36:12.750 --> 36:15.280
- No, the being a comedian.

36:15.280 --> 36:16.640
- Oh! Oh.

36:16.640 --> 36:20.020
Well, it's telling jokes mostly.

36:20.020 --> 36:25.020
Humorous anecdotes about my
life, painful experiences

36:25.140 --> 36:28.454
supplimated through the
critical eye and cynicism

36:28.454 --> 36:31.730
to get to the core of
the human experience,

36:31.730 --> 36:35.083
a long line to the DMV,
my ex-wife's cooking,

36:36.240 --> 36:37.470
fart jokes.

36:37.470 --> 36:39.160
- You were married?

36:39.160 --> 36:39.993
- No, no.

36:40.911 --> 36:42.863
- Oh okay, tell me a joke.

36:43.800 --> 36:44.977
- OK.

36:44.977 --> 36:46.934
I do have this one.

36:46.934 --> 36:48.580
Not a lot of people find
it very funny though.

36:48.580 --> 36:49.520
- Oh hey, try me.

36:49.520 --> 36:50.830
I have a great sense of humor.

36:50.830 --> 36:52.560
I used to write for MAD Magazine.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.270
- Really? You're a writer?

36:54.270 --> 36:55.830
- Nah, I left that shit behind.

36:55.830 --> 36:58.076
I am in bakery science now.

36:58.076 --> 37:01.110
- Bakery science, what's that?

37:01.110 --> 37:03.756
- I develop better emulsifiers all day.

37:03.756 --> 37:06.677
- Emulsifiers, that sounds fun.

37:06.677 --> 37:09.520
- OK, there's nothing
fun about bakery science.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.320
It is a tough field.

37:11.320 --> 37:12.770
Tougher than you would think.

37:13.730 --> 37:14.876
- OK.

37:14.876 --> 37:16.417
- Yeah, my friend invented
the stuffed crust pizza.

37:16.417 --> 37:19.490
Awards, limos, the whole bit.

37:19.490 --> 37:20.323
- Wow!

37:20.323 --> 37:22.820
- Yeah, she never has to
work again, lucky bitch.

37:22.820 --> 37:26.410
- So, what's the career
path for a bakery scientist?

37:26.410 --> 37:29.130
- The golden ticket is
creating a new flavor

37:29.130 --> 37:30.560
with one of the big guys.

37:30.560 --> 37:33.120
Little Debbie, Otis Spunkmeyer,

37:33.120 --> 37:35.810
snooty bastards down at Spunkmeyer.

37:35.810 --> 37:37.615
We're people too, Otis!

37:38.448 --> 37:39.281
- Neat.

37:43.540 --> 37:46.180
- That explosion was not my fault.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.139
- No, no, I didn't think that--

37:48.139 --> 37:49.927
- OK, tell me a joke.

37:49.927 --> 37:51.270
- OK, um...

37:51.270 --> 37:53.520
Well, the thing about Hitler is--

37:54.523 --> 37:56.730
Um, hi Brittney.

37:56.730 --> 37:57.563
- Hey.

37:57.563 --> 37:59.690
Met Hitler's great nephew once.

37:59.690 --> 38:00.523
Great guy.

38:00.523 --> 38:01.683
Made a mean ham salad.

38:03.170 --> 38:05.140
Don't waste your efforts
on this one, Dave.

38:05.140 --> 38:07.480
The female human Lilly
has her sights set on you.

38:07.480 --> 38:08.843
Respect the labe, Dave.

38:16.557 --> 38:18.058
- That's a big 409.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.050
Who's ready for charades?

38:25.050 --> 38:28.990
Yeah, Byron, how did you get here?

38:28.990 --> 38:31.180
- I brought eggnog and egg salad.

38:31.180 --> 38:33.240
- Well Dave already brought egg salad.

38:33.240 --> 38:34.550
Remember Dave? You fired him.

38:34.550 --> 38:35.560
Might be kinda awkward.

38:35.560 --> 38:38.300
- Yes but this is made with fish eggs.

38:38.300 --> 38:40.020
And before you go declaring your loyalty

38:40.020 --> 38:41.941
for certain past employees, remember,

38:41.941 --> 38:45.090
I control how big your Christmas bonus is.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.010
- You know what?

38:46.010 --> 38:46.843
That looks delicious.

38:46.843 --> 38:48.310
You make yourself at home.

38:48.310 --> 38:49.480
- Thanks.

38:50.540 --> 38:52.149
So sorry!

39:01.290 --> 39:02.660
- Is that eggnog?

39:02.660 --> 39:04.220
- Would you like to try some of my creamy

39:04.220 --> 39:05.540
and delicious eggnog?

39:05.540 --> 39:06.790
- Yeah, thanks.

39:20.930 --> 39:22.460
- I'm glad ya liked it.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.450
What's your name?

39:23.450 --> 39:25.870
- Upchuck, but all my
friends call me Greg.

39:25.870 --> 39:27.257
Just kidding, they call me Upchuck.

39:28.780 --> 39:29.613
- You're really funny.

39:29.613 --> 39:31.361
You should come down to my club,

39:31.361 --> 39:32.677
try doing some comedy.

39:32.677 --> 39:33.937
- That sounds dope.

39:33.937 --> 39:35.479
My friend Dave tells me it's hard,

39:35.479 --> 39:36.737
blah blah blah blah.

39:36.737 --> 39:37.570
- Oh, you know Dave.

39:37.570 --> 39:39.260
- Yeah, Dave, my roommate.

39:39.260 --> 39:41.852
Dave, come try some of this eggnog.

39:41.852 --> 39:44.740
Nevermind, I finished it
off, but it was fire though.

39:44.740 --> 39:47.640
- Hey uh, why is Byron here?

39:47.640 --> 39:49.450
- Oh yeah, listen, I don't want him

39:49.450 --> 39:51.270
or his weird fish egg salad here either,

39:51.270 --> 39:53.996
but I gotta schmooze for
that Christmas bonus.

39:53.996 --> 39:57.057
- I don't think Yuk Yuk's
does Christmas bonuses.

39:57.057 --> 39:59.310
- I thought maybe they were starting to.

39:59.310 --> 40:00.920
- Dave.

40:00.920 --> 40:04.110
- Oh, hi Byron.

40:04.110 --> 40:05.870
I heard that you brought egg salad.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.053
- That's correct.

40:10.039 --> 40:12.759
- Uh great, well it was
nice talking to you.

40:12.759 --> 40:15.110
- Wait Dave, I wanted to tell you that

40:15.110 --> 40:18.775
even though I fired you,
I saw you perform a lot

40:18.775 --> 40:23.775
and you should know that you
are really bad at standup.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.950
It's terrible, and that you
should definitely consider

40:28.950 --> 40:32.630
virtually any other
career other than standup,

40:32.630 --> 40:35.330
like what was that last set even?

40:35.330 --> 40:37.940
- Uh well, the church has--

40:37.940 --> 40:39.130
- It matters not, my pet.

40:39.130 --> 40:41.900
Now I realize that you consider me to be

40:41.900 --> 40:44.250
not only your boss, but a mentor.

40:44.250 --> 40:47.840
- I don't know what gave
you that impression.

40:47.840 --> 40:50.236
- So, you and Upchuck are roommates.

40:50.236 --> 40:51.780
What are his grooming habits?

40:51.780 --> 40:53.577
Do you know?

40:53.577 --> 40:55.610
Does he perhaps shave his
entire body below the neck?

40:55.610 --> 40:56.999
- You know what?

40:56.999 --> 40:59.213
I actually hear someone
calling me, so I'm gonna go.

41:06.090 --> 41:07.596
Brittney, is there someone in there?

41:07.596 --> 41:09.010
- No, don't be ridiculous.

41:09.010 --> 41:10.210
That was a chair.

41:10.210 --> 41:11.043
- But they were--

41:11.043 --> 41:12.860
- It's a wild party, Dave.

41:12.860 --> 41:14.257
You and your partner never
been bound head to foot

41:14.257 --> 41:15.670
with gags in your mouth?

41:15.670 --> 41:17.100
It's very sensual.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.316
- But who are they?

41:18.316 --> 41:19.149
- Have you seen Becks?

41:19.149 --> 41:19.982
According to the plan, I believe it's time

41:19.982 --> 41:21.940
for her distraction and
I have my tasks as well.

41:21.940 --> 41:23.240
- Plan? What plan?

41:23.240 --> 41:24.940
- Plan? What are you talking about?

41:24.940 --> 41:25.773
- You just said--

41:25.773 --> 41:28.070
- No I didn't Dave, I think
your drinking problem's

41:28.070 --> 41:30.380
heavily contributing to your scatterbrain.

41:30.380 --> 41:31.596
- I don't have a drinking--

41:31.596 --> 41:32.599
- Shh.

41:32.599 --> 41:34.480
The labor is hard, but you
must serve the mistress well.

41:34.480 --> 41:35.840
You must serve the labe.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.196
- OK, gather round everyone, gather round.

41:47.196 --> 41:51.580
It's time for the annual recitation of my

41:51.580 --> 41:52.963
favorite Christmas story.

41:53.820 --> 41:56.290
I'll start in Christmas Eve 1992.

41:56.290 --> 41:57.123
I was alone.

41:57.123 --> 41:58.865
- Weren't you born in 96?

41:58.865 --> 41:59.890
- It all started in 2004.

41:59.890 --> 42:01.690
Thank you Byron, I had my dates mixed up.

42:01.690 --> 42:04.960
It was the year my family and
I decided to spend Christmas

42:04.960 --> 42:06.023
roughing it abroad.

42:11.090 --> 42:12.800
- And now the cars.

42:12.800 --> 42:14.830
- So I'm hanging there
upside down over a huge pot

42:14.830 --> 42:17.760
of boiling vegetables when
I make direct eye contact

42:17.760 --> 42:19.470
with a tazmanian devil.

42:19.470 --> 42:21.330
- This sounds a lot like
another story I've heard

42:21.330 --> 42:22.900
starring Bugs Bunny.

42:22.900 --> 42:24.939
- Save your questions for the
end of the story, thank you.

42:24.939 --> 42:25.772
- Were you scared?

42:25.772 --> 42:27.900
- Terrified but I made a connection

42:27.900 --> 42:29.210
with that tazmanian devil.

42:29.210 --> 42:33.480
He looked at me and he said,
"Trust me, you're safe."

42:33.480 --> 42:35.470
Not with his, but telepathically.

42:35.470 --> 42:36.760
So I put on a brave face.

42:36.760 --> 42:39.910
- Like the face that the
cannibals were wearing?

42:39.910 --> 42:41.850
- No, those were actual faces.

42:41.850 --> 42:44.880
I just adopted courageous traits.

42:44.880 --> 42:46.599
I looked at the king and then I said yes,

42:46.599 --> 42:48.353
I will marry you.

42:59.596 --> 43:00.740
- I literally can't believe it.

43:00.740 --> 43:01.573
- God's truth.

43:01.573 --> 43:03.190
Ask Ryan Seacrest, he was
the one that bailed me out

43:03.190 --> 43:04.023
that night.

43:04.023 --> 43:05.540
All I ever asked for
was a bag of pork rinds

43:05.540 --> 43:07.780
and according to the locals,

43:07.780 --> 43:10.260
that was the first time it
snowed in over 100 years.

43:10.260 --> 43:11.740
- You're so brave.

43:11.740 --> 43:12.573
- I try my best.

43:12.573 --> 43:14.060
Anyway, here's to a merry Christmas.

43:14.060 --> 43:15.640
- I have a Christmas story too!

43:15.640 --> 43:17.470
But it's also a drinking game.

43:17.470 --> 43:19.383
Drink every time I say black guy.

43:41.083 --> 43:43.203
- Yuri, Yuri, do you receive?

43:45.090 --> 43:48.578
- Ya, we are
receiving you Sir.

43:48.578 --> 43:50.818
What is your?

43:50.818 --> 43:53.530
- The American Dave, I
believe he has the tape.

43:53.530 --> 43:55.940
The deviant, Becks,

43:55.940 --> 43:57.990
she says that he never leaves without it.

44:01.100 --> 44:03.618
- Retrieve the
tape from the American

44:03.618 --> 44:05.130
pig dogs by any means necessary.

44:05.130 --> 44:07.243
Many Soviet lives depend on it.

44:08.596 --> 44:12.323
- And when I do, I can
return home to mother Russia?

44:13.700 --> 44:16.460
- Da, only when you have the tape.

44:16.460 --> 44:19.003
Use whatever means necessary.

44:21.831 --> 44:24.610
- You'll have the tape, Yuri.

44:24.610 --> 44:26.790
Yes, you will.

44:28.990 --> 44:30.923
And I will have my revenge.

44:32.120 --> 44:33.840
- Are you done?

44:33.840 --> 44:36.447
- Yes, just one second
Jane, I'll be right out.

44:43.390 --> 44:46.141
- Let's kick this night
right in the baby maker.

44:52.030 --> 44:54.900
- So, you like whiskey, huh?

44:54.900 --> 44:58.920
- Yeah, um, I guess I'm not exactly having

44:58.920 --> 45:01.610
the best night or week.

45:01.610 --> 45:03.740
- Drowning your sorrows.

45:03.740 --> 45:04.850
Boy troubles?

45:04.850 --> 45:07.900
- Yeah well, no, I'm not gay.

45:07.900 --> 45:08.733
Are you gay?

45:08.733 --> 45:13.733
- No, no, I kinda thought
this was a gay party.

45:14.360 --> 45:15.600
So, girl troubles then?

45:15.600 --> 45:16.700
- Partially.

45:16.700 --> 45:19.580
My frigid long distance girlfriend

45:19.580 --> 45:21.740
decided to keep another
guy warm this winter.

45:21.740 --> 45:24.060
- Hm, so the whiskey.

45:24.060 --> 45:26.060
Well, here's to infidelity.

45:26.060 --> 45:30.410
My ex had a three-month
affair with the milk girl.

45:30.410 --> 45:31.243
- Milk girl?

45:31.243 --> 45:33.810
- Now they live on a dairy farm in Iowa,

45:33.810 --> 45:35.540
oddly enough.

45:35.540 --> 45:37.240
Enough about me.

45:37.240 --> 45:39.640
How well do you know Jane and Lilly?

45:39.640 --> 45:43.130
- Um, don't really know Jane.

45:43.130 --> 45:44.720
I've seen her around.

45:44.720 --> 45:49.060
And I've worked with Lilly
for the last six months

45:49.060 --> 45:50.050
at the club.

45:50.050 --> 45:52.738
Well worked, I got fired the other day.

45:52.738 --> 45:55.440
- Oh, I'm sorry.

45:55.440 --> 46:00.036
- Eh, I kinda yelled at
an old lady and she died.

46:00.036 --> 46:01.778
- Oh!

46:01.778 --> 46:02.743
Wow.

46:03.730 --> 46:04.563
That'll do it.

46:04.563 --> 46:05.450
- Yeah.

46:05.450 --> 46:07.458
- So, you work at the club.

46:07.458 --> 46:09.460
Worked, I mean.

46:09.460 --> 46:11.240
- Yeah, I'm a comic.

46:11.240 --> 46:14.460
Well, would be comic, I'm
not really that funny.

46:14.460 --> 46:16.380
- I can see how that
would be a career barrier.

46:16.380 --> 46:18.580
- Well actually ya
know, you'd be surprised

46:18.580 --> 46:20.580
with how many of the successful comedians

46:20.580 --> 46:22.653
aren't really that funny at all.

46:23.971 --> 46:28.230
- So, what do you think of Lilly?

46:28.230 --> 46:32.030
- Oh uh, Lilly is fine.

46:32.030 --> 46:34.350
- She sure can pound down the booze.

46:34.350 --> 46:37.270
- Yeah, I've never seen a woman

46:37.270 --> 46:40.840
drink so much vodka and
still be able to stand up.

46:40.840 --> 46:44.300
She gets this crazy
strength when she drinks.

46:44.300 --> 46:46.983
Ya know, she pushed a car out of a lake.

46:51.760 --> 46:54.970
So uh, do you like wine?

46:54.970 --> 46:55.803
- I like a good red.

46:55.803 --> 46:58.540
So Lilly, do you think that her behavior

46:58.540 --> 47:01.150
changes when she drinks to excess?

47:01.150 --> 47:02.860
That she becomes reckless?

47:02.860 --> 47:06.250
- Uh yeah, reckless is
probably a pretty good word

47:06.250 --> 47:07.363
to describe it.

47:08.445 --> 47:11.130
You know, you have really pretty eyes.

47:11.130 --> 47:14.700
- And do you think that
she habitually uses drugs?

47:14.700 --> 47:16.222
- Uh...

47:22.240 --> 47:23.073
- My bad.

47:24.220 --> 47:25.370
This is quite the spillage.

47:25.370 --> 47:27.513
- I'll go grab a towel.

47:28.722 --> 47:29.672
- I'll clean it up.

47:31.200 --> 47:33.370
- Um, yeah so, ya know,

47:33.370 --> 47:36.466
Allison said she was grabbing a towel.

47:43.890 --> 47:44.946
- Don't rub it!

47:44.946 --> 47:46.100
You have to dab it.

47:46.100 --> 47:46.963
Dab it!

47:48.258 --> 47:49.308
Ugh, let me show you.

48:11.750 --> 48:13.300
- Do you think you should help?

48:19.682 --> 48:21.440
- Hey, what took you so long?

48:21.440 --> 48:24.239
- All in good time, young
human, it's finished.

48:24.239 --> 48:25.906
- I'm having second thoughts.

48:25.906 --> 48:27.784
I mean, I love Dave, but this
all seems a little insane

48:27.784 --> 48:29.857
and kind of illegal and--

48:33.210 --> 48:36.060
- Once you're in steep, you've
just gotta go all the way.

48:43.430 --> 48:44.430
- What is happening?

48:45.640 --> 48:47.293
- There was a spill.

49:07.690 --> 49:08.970
- Whiskey.

49:08.970 --> 49:11.033
I prefer vodka but that tastes good.

49:12.317 --> 49:14.317
I like to try new things whenever I can.

49:15.390 --> 49:17.398
Do you like to try new things?

49:17.398 --> 49:19.677
- Um, well, I've been

49:19.677 --> 49:22.823
known to sample.

49:24.040 --> 49:26.410
- Do you know what it
means to be a man, Dave?

49:26.410 --> 49:28.909
- Making 20% more for the same work?

49:28.909 --> 49:31.083
- It mostly involves,

49:32.300 --> 49:35.430
how do you say, butt sex.

49:37.580 --> 49:38.543
- What?

49:38.543 --> 49:41.090
- Care to join me in the shadowy corners

49:41.090 --> 49:43.423
for some passionate necking?

49:49.540 --> 49:51.047
- Don't really know--

49:55.192 --> 49:56.025
Ah...

49:59.540 --> 50:02.690
So uh, are you a fan of Kippling.

50:02.690 --> 50:04.850
- No.

50:04.850 --> 50:05.683
- OK.

50:06.829 --> 50:07.920
Uh...

50:19.430 --> 50:21.890
- So what was that you were
talking to Becks about earlier?

50:21.890 --> 50:25.623
Some VHS tape with an Armanian comedian?

50:26.488 --> 50:28.160
Animal soul train?

50:28.160 --> 50:30.860
- Oh yeah, Russian actually.

50:30.860 --> 50:33.500
Yeah, Anatoli Big Tony Solshinitzen.

50:33.500 --> 50:35.850
It was his last performance
before he was sent

50:35.850 --> 50:38.110
to the Goulag and disappeared forever.

50:38.110 --> 50:39.640
- That's fascinating!

50:39.640 --> 50:42.205
- Yeah, thank you, yes it is.

50:42.205 --> 50:44.130
Actually, he wasn't Russian.

50:44.130 --> 50:46.320
He was Lithuanian by birth.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.490
His paternal grandfather raised him.

50:48.490 --> 50:50.640
He talked a lot about
his childhood in his act,

50:50.640 --> 50:54.340
you know, he wove these
beautiful themes of loss

50:54.340 --> 50:57.550
and humanity mixed in
with the jokes about farts

50:57.550 --> 50:59.000
and borscht, ya know?

50:59.000 --> 51:00.730
- That's very interesting.

51:00.730 --> 51:02.183
I'd love to see it.

51:02.183 --> 51:03.620
Do you have it with you, the tape?

51:03.620 --> 51:04.620
- Yeah, yeah always.

51:06.167 --> 51:07.000
- Ah!

51:09.582 --> 51:10.690
Lilly!

51:10.690 --> 51:11.523
- Jane!

51:11.523 --> 51:14.630
- Have you forgetten-say about Allison-A?

51:15.470 --> 51:16.550
- Like a threesome?

51:16.550 --> 51:19.100
Wait just a minute and
I'll go get my ugly friend.

51:19.100 --> 51:20.283
- No threesome!

51:20.283 --> 51:21.116
You promised!

51:21.116 --> 51:23.610
A Christmas boyfriend for Allison!

51:23.610 --> 51:26.130
- Wait, are you guys,

51:26.130 --> 51:28.040
you guys planning to
set me up with Allison?

51:28.040 --> 51:31.270
- Well you see, last year,
there was an escaped bull

51:31.270 --> 51:33.170
that gorged Michael to death.

51:33.170 --> 51:34.650
- Uh huh, uh huh, OK.

51:34.650 --> 51:36.327
Does Allison like me?

51:36.327 --> 51:39.360
- I'm so sorry, I just
really needed a pick me up

51:39.360 --> 51:42.110
after the spill and global
warming and what not.

51:42.110 --> 51:44.763
- This bitch understands
the struggle, babe.

51:44.763 --> 51:48.670
But it looks like the only
other guys at this party

51:48.670 --> 51:50.761
are gonna hook up with each other.

51:50.761 --> 51:53.130
This could be ugly's only change.

51:53.130 --> 51:54.323
I mean, Allison.

51:55.190 --> 51:57.920
- Right, I'm such a bad friend.

51:57.920 --> 51:59.770
- No, you're a good friend!

51:59.770 --> 52:01.686
When you try.

52:01.686 --> 52:05.160
Do you wanna bump some lines
and maybe make out later?

52:05.160 --> 52:06.285
- Sure!

52:06.285 --> 52:07.118
- Besties!

52:27.010 --> 52:29.729
- Just may as well find something.

52:29.729 --> 52:30.562
A note.

52:52.780 --> 52:55.230
- Hi, I'm Dave and this
is my audition tape

52:55.230 --> 52:56.270
for Last Comic Standing.

52:56.270 --> 52:59.067
Hey, Upchuck, would you
hold the camera still?

52:59.067 --> 53:00.343
Thank you.

53:01.350 --> 53:04.470
OK, so the best thing about Hitler

53:04.470 --> 53:07.307
is not his mustache, but it's actu--

53:19.190 --> 53:23.140
And that is why I just
love the Jewish community,

53:23.140 --> 53:25.090
my favorite people in the entire world.

53:30.560 --> 53:32.760
- Hey, how did you get
Dave's audition tape?

53:53.507 --> 53:54.625
- So what are you doing?

53:54.625 --> 53:59.430
- Lilly asked me to
grab something from her purse.

53:59.430 --> 54:01.490
- Cool, cool, yeah.

54:01.490 --> 54:06.440
Grabbing stuff for your friends, cool.

54:06.440 --> 54:08.630
So, what did she ask you to get?

54:08.630 --> 54:10.280
- Uh, this.

54:10.280 --> 54:13.980
- Oh um, you know, Lilly actually did seem

54:13.980 --> 54:16.060
like she would need that right about now.

54:16.060 --> 54:19.467
- She seemed like she needed a dildo?

54:19.467 --> 54:22.550
- I think yeah, a penis, a pick me up.

54:22.550 --> 54:26.150
I mean, hey, you're the one
gettin' it for her right?

54:26.150 --> 54:27.770
- Yeah, right.

54:27.770 --> 54:30.983
Her party pick me up penis.

54:32.603 --> 54:33.650
Uh...

54:35.387 --> 54:36.890
So what are you gonna do now?

54:36.890 --> 54:39.265
Now that you're not at the club anymore?

54:39.265 --> 54:41.970
- Oh um, I don't know.

54:41.970 --> 54:45.330
Probably something that
I'll fail utterly at again.

54:45.330 --> 54:49.320
- No, everybody fails at something.

54:49.320 --> 54:51.490
Everybody falls flat on their face.

54:51.490 --> 54:53.060
It's a part of life.

54:53.060 --> 54:55.770
- So have you fallen flat on your face?

54:55.770 --> 54:57.223
- Well, no.

54:59.650 --> 55:04.650
Actually, I did get second place
at a spelling bee one time.

55:05.680 --> 55:07.370
But that's not the point.

55:07.370 --> 55:11.260
The point is that it's
part of becoming an adult.

55:11.260 --> 55:15.920
You aren't really an adult
until you have failed utterly.

55:15.920 --> 55:17.323
Something important to you.

55:18.990 --> 55:21.840
Maybe if I haven't totally boned it,

55:21.840 --> 55:24.033
then I'm not really grown up.

55:26.240 --> 55:29.923
But you have and that's good because

55:29.923 --> 55:34.923
now you can take this
moment and learn from it

55:35.980 --> 55:38.583
and grow into the real you.

55:40.230 --> 55:43.970
- Yeah, ya know Allison,
I think you're right.

55:43.970 --> 55:47.170
I've been beating myself
up like someone just like

55:47.170 --> 55:49.809
grabbed my hand and said,
"Stop hitting yourself!

55:49.809 --> 55:51.050
"Stop hitting yourself,
stop hitting yourself,"

55:51.050 --> 55:52.920
and then I've opened my eyes

55:52.920 --> 55:54.623
and it was just me the whole time.

55:55.787 --> 55:58.320
I just ya know, I need to own this.

55:58.320 --> 56:00.103
I need to own it, ya know?

56:00.103 --> 56:02.280
Thank you, thank you Allison.

56:08.070 --> 56:10.293
- Dave, can I trust you?

56:11.144 --> 56:13.540
- Uh, yeah sure.

56:13.540 --> 56:15.163
- I have a confession to make.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.410
I'm an investigative reporter
and I'm researching something,

56:19.410 --> 56:21.853
something explosive, I mean really big.

56:22.860 --> 56:24.210
And I might need your help.

56:25.170 --> 56:27.863
The fate of the world may
rest on your decision.

56:29.686 --> 56:34.686
- What kind of help?

56:48.460 --> 56:49.610
- They said they didn't
cast me because I was

56:49.610 --> 56:50.610
too good looking.

56:50.610 --> 56:52.130
- Have you guys seen Upchuck?

56:52.130 --> 56:54.090
Sexy little peanut disappeared on me.

56:54.090 --> 56:57.410
- He left to chase a
squirrel or something.

56:57.410 --> 56:59.140
- That guy and his rodents, what a riot.

56:59.140 --> 57:00.380
- What?

57:00.380 --> 57:02.350
- Lilly, where have you been?

57:02.350 --> 57:05.740
Mama always said to dance
with the one who brung ya.

57:05.740 --> 57:08.010
I've danced all my dances.

57:08.010 --> 57:09.393
- What?

57:09.393 --> 57:11.890
- Have you ever felt like
you've lost something

57:11.890 --> 57:14.030
really important but you realize

57:14.030 --> 57:16.210
you've already snorted it?

57:16.210 --> 57:17.520
- Oh!

57:17.520 --> 57:18.840
I see.

57:18.840 --> 57:21.380
- I'm all out and Byron has a guy nearby.

57:21.380 --> 57:22.213
- I do.

57:23.420 --> 57:26.000
- So we're gonna go on
a little field trip.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.080
- But we're coming back, right?

57:28.080 --> 57:29.290
For Allison, I mean?

57:29.290 --> 57:30.833
- I don't know, yeah, maybe.

57:30.833 --> 57:33.930
But Mama's got a fee that comes first!

57:33.930 --> 57:35.371
Allison.

57:35.371 --> 57:36.449
Allison!

57:39.710 --> 57:43.300
Damn it to hell son of a bitch!

57:43.300 --> 57:46.110
- Listen Becks, I really appreciate you

57:46.110 --> 57:48.300
throwing this party for me but,

57:48.300 --> 57:50.560
you know, maybe I should
just work through this thing

57:50.560 --> 57:52.180
on my own, you know?

57:52.180 --> 57:53.450
I gotta be my own man.

57:53.450 --> 57:56.810
- Dave, I've not even yet
begun to humiliate myself

57:56.810 --> 57:59.350
for the benefit of your loins.

57:59.350 --> 58:03.250
- That's creepy but, ya
know, I'm afraid that

58:03.250 --> 58:06.640
all your effort on behalf on my loins

58:06.640 --> 58:08.190
tonight haven't really--

58:08.190 --> 58:10.360
- Just wait a few more seconds.

58:10.360 --> 58:11.193
- What?

58:11.193 --> 58:14.300
- Five, four, three, two--

58:14.300 --> 58:17.920
Well hello Jane, Lilly, Allison and Byron.

58:17.920 --> 58:19.370
What are you doing back?

58:19.370 --> 58:21.160
- Hi, uh, my car wouldn't start.

58:21.160 --> 58:22.440
- Oh no!

58:22.440 --> 58:24.290
- That was a drug run, right?

58:26.570 --> 58:27.880
- Who calls it that?

58:27.880 --> 58:30.107
And why would that pup go
chasing after that squirrel

58:30.107 --> 58:31.853
when there's a perfectly
good otter right here?

58:31.853 --> 58:34.090
- This is just awful
and during a snowstorm

58:34.090 --> 58:36.737
in which the likes of snow
goddess Chione has never seen.

58:36.737 --> 58:38.730
And Upchuck's car won't start either.

58:38.730 --> 58:39.750
- How do you know that?

58:39.750 --> 58:40.900
Is he back already?

58:40.900 --> 58:42.360
- I mean, if we can't find Upchuck,

58:42.360 --> 58:44.049
we can't find his keys, right?

58:44.049 --> 58:45.690
- And I Ubered here and
frankly was hoping to be

58:45.690 --> 58:47.520
taken home by someone.

58:47.520 --> 58:49.840
- Do you mind if we stay
in here where it's warm

58:49.840 --> 58:51.200
while we wait and call for an Uber?

58:51.200 --> 58:52.604
- Absolutely.

58:52.604 --> 58:53.603
- Damn it.

58:53.603 --> 58:54.436
- What is it, my dear?

58:54.436 --> 58:55.269
- I don't have signal!

58:55.269 --> 58:56.102
No bars!

58:56.102 --> 58:56.935
Do you have WiFi?

58:56.935 --> 58:58.600
- Oh no, no, no, no, no.
- No WiFi.

58:58.600 --> 59:00.690
- Lilly, do you have a signal?

59:00.690 --> 59:02.886
- Nope, not at all, strange.

59:02.886 --> 59:06.490
- Does anybody have a signal?

59:06.490 --> 59:07.323
- Nope.

59:07.323 --> 59:08.156
- Nothing here.

59:08.156 --> 59:09.750
- Becks, you have a car.

59:09.750 --> 59:11.100
Please, I have somewhere I need to be.

59:11.100 --> 59:12.700
- Uh actually, my car is in the shop.

59:12.700 --> 59:14.810
I got dropped off by a cab.

59:14.810 --> 59:17.079
Bad flux capacitor.

59:17.079 --> 59:17.912
- Damn it to hell!

59:17.912 --> 59:18.745
Son of a bitch!

59:18.745 --> 59:20.040
- We could walk.

59:20.040 --> 59:21.620
- In this weather?

59:21.620 --> 59:22.960
Maybe we should just stay a while.

59:22.960 --> 59:24.463
- Let's check the radio!

59:25.810 --> 59:27.220
- And the blizzard
conditions will continue

59:27.220 --> 59:30.330
for at least 36 hours, so
if you are somewhere safe,

59:30.330 --> 59:31.960
for God's sake, stay there!

59:31.960 --> 59:34.289
You don't wanna be out in this,

59:34.289 --> 59:36.006
not to mention the mass escape from the

59:36.006 --> 59:38.310
state mental hospital for
the extra criminally insane

59:38.310 --> 59:39.300
that just happened.

59:39.300 --> 59:41.473
Some bad characters out there for sure.

59:42.520 --> 59:46.171
- Whew, well, that sounds bad.

59:46.171 --> 59:47.940
- Everyone settle in.

59:47.940 --> 59:50.320
We still have games, parties and drinks,

59:50.320 --> 59:52.689
and some surprises in store.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.200
- Song.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.383
Uh sand baby.

01:00:07.233 --> 01:00:08.066
- Uh, songs about sex.

01:00:08.066 --> 01:00:10.090
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:11.527
Take me out to the ball game.

01:00:11.527 --> 01:00:13.890
- Hit me baby one more time?

01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:15.750
- Time's up.

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:17.810
- It's the Game of Thrones theme song!

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:19.443
- OK, I'll go next.

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:22.240
OK, this is a movie.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.290
- No, you can't talk.

01:00:24.175 --> 01:00:25.430
- Now.

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:26.993
- You can't talk man!

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.030
- Uh, War Horse.

01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:31.000
- Horse Whisperer.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:31.833
- Flicka.

01:00:31.833 --> 01:00:33.086
- Cowboys.

01:00:33.086 --> 01:00:34.126
- No talking!

01:00:35.128 --> 01:00:36.126
- True Grit.

01:00:36.126 --> 01:00:37.128
- Jaws.

01:00:37.128 --> 01:00:38.126
- The Shining?

01:00:38.126 --> 01:00:39.420
Kill Bill Volume One.

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:40.253
- Rocky one.

01:00:40.253 --> 01:00:41.086
- The Shining?

01:00:41.086 --> 01:00:42.510
- Rocky two.

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:43.507
- Kill Bill Volume Two.

01:00:43.507 --> 01:00:44.520
- Rocky three?

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.507
- A New Hope.

01:00:45.507 --> 01:00:46.340
- Rocky four.

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:47.173
- E.T., E.T.!

01:00:47.173 --> 01:00:48.006
- Terminator!

01:00:48.006 --> 01:00:48.839
- Shining?

01:01:00.822 --> 01:01:01.655
- So are you having fun?

01:01:01.655 --> 01:01:02.690
- Totes.

01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:03.523
Brittney, right?

01:01:03.523 --> 01:01:04.990
- That's the name I've chosen.

01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:07.230
From the before time, I
was called something else.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:08.810
- That's interesting.

01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:10.330
- I used to be called The Brave Balini.

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:11.250
- Where are you from?

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:12.173
- The circus.

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:15.120
- Oh, there's a hair in there, sorry.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.100
- That's interesting.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.506
I don't see a hair and
I have 20/70 vision.

01:01:18.506 --> 01:01:20.920
- I took a couple sips from it.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.210
You could get another one though.

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:23.540
- Are you still interested in Dave?

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.000
It's been a while since
you've talked to him.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.026
- I like to take things slow sometimes.

01:01:27.026 --> 01:01:30.528
- It's really
whipping up out there.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.230
- I see you got some punch as well.

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:44.421
- I thirst for mango sorbet,
sugar, and productivity.

01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:51.020
That's a really nice painting.

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:52.309
- What painting?

01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:56.070
Is that crown molding?

01:01:58.028 --> 01:02:01.060
- Dave has
an interesting shirt on.

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:02.610
- Why's that man naked?

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.123
- Charades sure makes me thirsty.

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:16.610
Who's ready for the next round?

01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:17.950
Upchuck sure doesn't
know what he's missing

01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:19.950
and you know what a really good game is?

01:02:21.787 --> 01:02:23.720
Really good game is spin the--

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.060
- Spin the, what are you going to spin?

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:27.365
- Book!

01:02:27.365 --> 01:02:28.198
- No, movie.

01:02:28.198 --> 01:02:29.383
- Uh, Because of Winn Dixie.

01:02:29.383 --> 01:02:30.381
- The Shining?

01:02:30.381 --> 01:02:31.923
- The commemorative
statuette of liberty.

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.093
- Wow!

01:02:40.528 --> 01:02:41.704
It's hot in here, isn't it?

01:02:41.704 --> 01:02:42.870
It's hot in here, right?

01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:44.553
Who else got the egg salad?

01:02:51.227 --> 01:02:54.323
- Well, clearly,

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:57.300
someone's had too much to drink.

01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:58.320
Somebody give me a hand.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.820
He just needs to sleep it off.

01:03:07.723 --> 01:03:09.973
- I may have miscalculated.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:15.440
- You sure he's alright?

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.950
- What a lightweight.

01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:18.310
If anyone wants to draw dicks on his face,

01:03:18.310 --> 01:03:20.010
there's sharpies by the solo cups.

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.690
- Hey, can I have that?

01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:25.200
What?

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.621
- Nothing.

01:03:26.621 --> 01:03:28.498
- That one should be fine.

that's the right thing to do right now.

01:03:41.104 --> 01:03:43.060

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.880
- Who am I kidding?

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:48.350
Look at you with your red hair.

01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:51.420
You never take time to
stoop off your high horse

01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:54.020

- My name is not Lilly, it's Svetlanna

and I've been trained
to withstand the most

01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:43.860
extreme torture and not crack,

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:46.010
but spending the last few
months with the likes of you

01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:48.208
is all the torture I can take.

01:04:48.208 --> 01:04:49.547

Oh, I feel so good.

- What do you want?

01:05:08.548 --> 01:05:10.470
You can literally steal anything you want

01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:11.620
from this house.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.540

His skin tastes like beef jerky.

01:05:22.027 --> 01:05:24.290
- I guess that's not the
first time I've heard that.

01:05:24.290 --> 01:05:25.950
- The tape.

01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:26.883
- Scotch tape?

01:05:27.925 --> 01:05:30.010
- Anatoli Solshinitzen,
you have the world's

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:33.180
only remaining copy of his
last known performance.

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:34.013
- Enema Soul Train?

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:36.520
- It's a film we've
been looking for for the past

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.128
20 years.

01:05:38.128 --> 01:05:39.540
- Wow!

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:40.373
Are you a fan of his work?

01:05:40.373 --> 01:05:41.547
- He was swine.

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.787
Anatoli was one of the
biggest conspirators

01:05:45.787 --> 01:05:48.340
of an unsuccessful
insurrection against Soviet.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.840
It is said in the tape,
he had revel secrets

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.468
within bad jokes.

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:56.270
- They are not bad.

- Lesbianca, throw me that bag.

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.083
- No! It's fragile!

01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:07.093
Big Tony.

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:12.800
- Was this another audition tape?

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:19.260
- Aha! The smoking gun!

01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:21.840
Two grand spent at JJ's bar

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.609
and for Tammy?

01:06:23.609 --> 01:06:24.883
Who's Tammy?

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:30.830
- Fact, tomorrow I go
back home to mother Russia

01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:33.520
with the rebel secrets
or the ugly gets it.

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.353
- No!

01:06:34.353 --> 01:06:36.920
- I did not think this is
how my night was gonna go.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.400
- You can't kill her.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.020
She...

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:41.390
She has dirt on you.

01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:42.727
- What?

01:06:42.727 --> 01:06:43.726
- What?

01:06:43.726 --> 01:06:44.780
- Yeah she's an investigative journalist

01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:47.326
and boy, you don't wanna
get on her bad side.

01:06:47.326 --> 01:06:49.620
- Dave, how is that going to help me

01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:51.010
get out of this alive?

01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:54.273
- So, you're not a horse doctor?

01:06:55.406 --> 01:06:57.330
- I've never even seen a horse.

01:06:57.330 --> 01:07:00.009
- Who do you work for?

01:07:00.009 --> 01:07:04.103
- Teeny Bop Bubblegum Magazine.

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:04.936
- What the hell is that?

01:07:04.936 --> 01:07:07.390
- I read that, they have great quizzes.

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:10.470
- I was doing an expose on binge drinking

01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:11.653
among millennials.

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:14.745
Lilly was my research subject.

01:07:14.745 --> 01:07:16.985
- Liars! All my friends are liars!

01:07:16.985 --> 01:07:18.068
I'm so horny!

01:07:18.985 --> 01:07:20.318
I'm so confused!

01:07:21.188 --> 01:07:22.185
- Save!

01:07:22.185 --> 01:07:24.102
- Wait, don't hurt her.

01:07:24.964 --> 01:07:25.797
I know the tape by heart.

01:07:25.797 --> 01:07:27.710
I can recite it word for word.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.990
Please, take me, you
really don't need Allison.

01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:32.053
- Dave, no.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:34.110
- Is this true?

01:07:34.110 --> 01:07:35.523
Even the parts in Russian?

01:07:39.844 --> 01:07:41.166
- Impressed.

01:07:41.166 --> 01:07:43.166
- Well, I don't know what it means

01:07:43.166 --> 01:07:45.550
but I can recite it phonetically.

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:48.720
- You say you want to go
back home and kiss mother?

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.553
- Gross.

01:07:54.367 --> 01:07:56.800
- Dave, you come with me.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.190
Unfortunately for the rest of you,

01:07:58.190 --> 01:08:00.680
there can be no witnesses.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.263
Lesbianca, you die first.

01:08:03.883 --> 01:08:05.193
- Oh God, it's happening.

01:08:19.966 --> 01:08:21.886
- The Brave Balini.

01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:25.268
- Again?

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:27.550
- This was all easier when you all comply,

01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:28.843
American scum.

01:08:30.024 --> 01:08:33.465
- Well I'm proud to be an American.

01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:49.865
I pledge allegiance to the flag.

01:08:49.865 --> 01:08:51.162
- Oh no, no, no.

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.930
Well, she died how she lived,

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:56.206
passed out on the ground
covered in alcohol.

01:08:56.206 --> 01:08:58.113
What are you doing?

01:08:59.370 --> 01:09:01.100
- Haven't you seen Halloween?

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:04.542
The villain always comes
back for one last scare.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:14.983
Hey, since when has John
Carpenter directed my life, right?

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.029
- You didn't hit her once!

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:27.180
- Should someone call the police?

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:28.390
- Yeah, we should probably uninstall

01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:30.362
the cell phone blockers.

01:09:30.362 --> 01:09:31.194
- The what?

01:09:31.194 --> 01:09:33.950
- Uh, negative, having
any police officials here

01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:36.399
would be bad for someone
wanted in 13 states.

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:37.609
- You?

01:09:37.609 --> 01:09:39.140
- The smaller ones.

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:42.029
- There's a woman with
half her face on the floor.

01:09:42.029 --> 01:09:43.950
Jane's thighs are oozing

01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:46.162
and Byron still hasn't even woken up!

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.708
- We'll meet again soon, young human.

01:09:54.708 --> 01:09:55.710
- What?

01:09:55.710 --> 01:09:57.769
- FBI, get down on the ground!

01:09:57.769 --> 01:09:59.010
Everybody get down on the ground!

01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:00.793
- Brittney? Brittney?

01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:09.643
Brandy?

01:10:09.643 --> 01:10:10.476
- Bethany.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.980
Well Becks, thanks to the tracking device

01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:18.400
I put in your butt, you
led us right to our target.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.233
- What?

01:10:19.233 --> 01:10:20.690
- Sorry it took us an extra minute.

01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:22.530
Something was blocking
our signal for a while.

01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:23.650
- What's in my butt?

01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:25.740
- Which one of you is Allison?

01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:26.573
- Me.

01:10:26.573 --> 01:10:29.050
- You have a Teeny
Bopper Bubblegum Magazine

01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:31.230
issued recording device, correct?

01:10:31.230 --> 01:10:32.063
- This one?

01:10:32.063 --> 01:10:33.500
- Thanks, we'll use this in court.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.080
You probably just saved the country

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.910
from lots of bad guys.

01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:37.960
And Dave.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.207
- Huh?

01:10:39.207 --> 01:10:40.040
- You have photographic memory.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:40.873
- What's in my butt?

01:10:40.873 --> 01:10:41.710
- Uh yeah.

01:10:41.710 --> 01:10:43.920
- Skills like that, we could
really use on the force.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.560
Have you ever considered
a career in the FBI?

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.680
- No.

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.566
Uh, but I will now.

01:10:49.566 --> 01:10:51.140
- Give me a call sometimes.

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.823
We'll find a spot for you.

01:10:53.710 --> 01:10:56.710
- Does she even see him shoot?

01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:58.003
Can I have some help please?

01:10:59.524 --> 01:11:00.941
Hey, you're cute!

01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:52.547
- It really is a Christmas miracle.
