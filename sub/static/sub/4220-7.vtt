WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:02.043
Do you wanna go
to Vegas with me?

00:02.127 --> 00:04.045
I'm not sure how great
of an idea that is.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.093
We'd have to put
the wedding on hold.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.095
Until you've completed
your first year as candidate.

00:12.179 --> 00:15.890
We acknowledge that this
kind of arrangement could
put a lot of pressure on us.

00:16.308 --> 00:17.642
I got a job coming up
after shift.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.769
I could use
a second set of eyes.
What kinda job?

00:21.230 --> 00:22.271
Go, go, go!

00:27.444 --> 00:29.070
Hey. 'Sup, Newhouse?
'Sup?

00:29.822 --> 00:31.739
Yo. Yo, man,
what happened?

00:32.116 --> 00:35.034
Uh... Oh, man, it's nothing.
A little misunderstanding.

00:37.121 --> 00:39.747
And I thought you said
you were gonna get
this window fixed.

00:39.832 --> 00:40.957
Ah, it broke again.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.167
What can you do?

00:43.252 --> 00:45.753
Look, I have two crates
of chocolates in here

00:45.838 --> 00:48.715
that can't
walk themselves inside,
so help me out, man.

00:50.092 --> 00:51.175
Hey!

00:52.428 --> 00:54.470
You would tell me
if you were jammed up,
right?

00:55.055 --> 00:57.223
Hell, yeah.
We're boys.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.896
Okay! I need a volunteer.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.440
- No.
- No way. Ugh.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.401
You guys, Molly's II
is almost up and running.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.652
Do we have a menu? No.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.237
Do we have a cook? No.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.363
At least I'm doing something.

01:12.448 --> 01:14.282
Listen to your
colleague here.

01:14.366 --> 01:18.619
No. I was very specific
about the time table
afforded.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.246
Eight weeks, okay?

01:20.330 --> 01:22.457
And you've burned through
half of it already.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.000
Yeah, yeah.
We'll be ready.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.002
We'll be ready.
We just...

01:26.128 --> 01:27.920
We just need
a signature dish.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.464
I'll try it.

01:30.466 --> 01:32.258
Sylvie!
No. No!

01:33.385 --> 01:34.594
No.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.556
Mmm.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.224
Tangy.

01:40.309 --> 01:41.893
Ah, Dominican sausage
and peppers.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.895
Dude, if you keep calling
your food "Dominican,"

01:43.979 --> 01:45.313
I am going to have to
kick your ass

01:45.397 --> 01:46.606
on behalf of
an entire country.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.608
All right, fine.
Well, who's gonna
be the cook?

01:48.692 --> 01:49.984
Hey, listen,
I got a cousin.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.361
You know,
a really nice Russian girl.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.488
No more cousins from you.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.032
Hey, it's a totally
different cousin!
No more with the cousins!

01:56.116 --> 01:57.617
Hey, guys.

01:57.701 --> 02:00.745
Oh! Newhouse!
What's the thing
with the face?

02:00.829 --> 02:02.455
It's starting to be
regular with you.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.916
You got a secret fight club
or something
we don't know about?

02:05.042 --> 02:06.334
Yeah, man,
you wanna join?

02:06.418 --> 02:09.378
What, and endanger
this work of art?
I'll pass.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.673
- Finally, something edible.
- Whoo!

02:12.758 --> 02:13.800
Three bucks.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.887
Naomi's academic
decathlon team has made it
to the finals in DC.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.431
And I need to raise 1,500
for her travel expenses.

02:22.059 --> 02:26.145
Hey. Your kid is in
the academic decathlon
finals.

02:26.230 --> 02:27.438
You must be doing
something right.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.398
Yeah.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.319
- He's alive!
- Hey!

02:33.403 --> 02:34.779
- Look at you!
- Hey, hey, hey.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.531
How was Vegas?
It was great.

02:36.615 --> 02:39.033
It was really great.
Uh, is Boden around?

02:39.576 --> 02:41.035
In his office.
Okay.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.790
I can't get the image
out of my head of you.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.333
Well, I didn't
even finish with the detail...

02:47.417 --> 02:49.877
Chief?
Uh, Mouch. Great.
You're here, too.

02:49.962 --> 02:52.046
Um, you got a minute?

02:52.130 --> 02:54.966
Vegas!
Yeah, man! Yeah!

02:59.054 --> 03:00.888
So, uh, you look good.

03:00.973 --> 03:02.056
Looks like the trip
was good for you.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.141
Yeah. Yeah.
Vegas was great.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.519
Uh, you know,
played a little craps,

03:06.603 --> 03:07.812
hit the pool,
got some sun.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.856
And, uh...
Oh, yeah.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.149
I got married.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.120
Ha-ha!

03:27.457 --> 03:30.042
Congratulations.
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Sure. Of course!

03:30.127 --> 03:31.711
Congratulations.
Oh, thank you, guys.

03:31.795 --> 03:35.381
And, uh, Mouch, I wanted
to ask you about helping me
sort out my insurance,

03:35.465 --> 03:37.091
pension, getting
her name on it.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.801
Her name, that kind of...
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:38.886 --> 03:39.969
You're serious?

03:40.971 --> 03:42.513
Yeah. I got married.

03:48.228 --> 03:52.565
Uh, okay. Well, then
there's a considerable
amount of paperwork

03:52.649 --> 03:54.150
to be gathered
in that case.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.277
Uh, it'll take me
some time.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.154
Cool. Thanks.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.364
Yeah.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.670
Her name's Brittany Baker.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.298
She's a graphic artist
from Tallahassee.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.175
I met her at the craps table,
we hit it off.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.093
Twenty-four hours later,
boom!

04:21.178 --> 04:22.678
Silver Bells Wedding Chapel.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.473
She's coming by
later in the shift.
You're gonna love her.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.058
You're gonna love her.

04:32.189 --> 04:35.274
All right, yeah. Okay.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

04:35.359 --> 04:37.443
All right, you got us
all set up.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.070
Where's the punchline?

04:39.154 --> 04:42.823
I got married. In Vegas.
Her name's Brittany.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.248
Okay, great! Mazel tov!

04:51.333 --> 04:53.000
Thank you!

04:53.919 --> 04:55.878
Congrats, bud.
Thank you.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.132
So you had to bail
on the Vegas trip.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.927
See, this is what happens
when he's left
to his own devices.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.888
I told you.
My mom had a yard sale
and I had to help!

05:08.725 --> 05:10.101
Whoo. Hey.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.062
Just think. You almost
went to Vegas with him.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.231
That could've been you.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.441
Mmm. Yeah.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.991
Hey. You all right?

05:25.826 --> 05:26.951
Yeah.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.120
So, this wedding thing.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.497
Legit!

05:31.581 --> 05:34.208
Legit. Look,
I'm telling you,

05:34.292 --> 05:35.584
once you meet her,
you'll get it.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.003
Okay? You're really
gonna like her.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.672
You don't need
to convince me.
If you're good, I'm good.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.132
And she's out looking
for places right now.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.383
We're gonna end up
staying in a hotel

05:42.509 --> 05:44.176
until we find
something of our own.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.721
What're you talking about?
You have a place to live.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.055
Nah, dude, I...
We can't.

05:48.140 --> 05:51.434
Our home is your home,
and that makes it her home.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.311
You sure you don't wanna
check with Dawson first?

05:54.396 --> 05:56.022
Dawson's gonna say
the same thing I am.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.400
Thank you.
Sure.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.278
So, uh, you got a photo?

06:02.738 --> 06:03.821
Ah!

06:05.198 --> 06:07.074
I just got this one
of her at the pool.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.912
Huh?
Congratulations.

06:13.290 --> 06:17.043
Truck 81,
Squad 3, Ambulance 61.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.295
Single vehicle accident.
Passenger trapped.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.062
Now, that ain't good.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.272
Guys,
get the extinguishers.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.903
Trench is too narrow
for side access.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.697
Dawson, get down there
and see if we can
get 'em out in front.

06:46.782 --> 06:47.990
Right.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.750
Hi. My name's Gabriela.
We're gonna get you out,
all right?

06:57.834 --> 06:59.960
What's your name?
Allison.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.671
Allison, you feel any pain?

07:02.839 --> 07:04.423
My... My head.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.051
Yeah, I can see you got a...
You got a cut there.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.677
You think that
you lost consciousness?

07:08.762 --> 07:10.888
Allison, look at me.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.431
Do not try to take off
your seat belt.

07:12.516 --> 07:13.933
We're gonna
extricate you safely.

07:15.352 --> 07:18.479
People lose air
in situations like this.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.689
I can't stay in here.
I can't!

07:20.774 --> 07:23.734
Allison, I know
that it's scary, but
we know what we're doing.

07:23.819 --> 07:26.195
I just need you to give me
a couple slow, deep breaths.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.405
In and out. In and out.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.617
Yo! Dawson!

07:31.701 --> 07:34.036
Dawson, get back!

07:42.838 --> 07:44.296
Can we get in there?

07:44.381 --> 07:45.548
No, it's too tight.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.883
We got one female trapped.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.343
Go in from the bottom?

07:49.427 --> 07:51.095
We don't have
any other options.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.055
Okay, we're gonna
crack the frame.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.932
What does
"cracking the frame" mean?

07:55.475 --> 07:57.560
It's a technique we use
to take off
the bottom of the car.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.479
Hey, Tony, grab the Hurst.
Newhouse, Capp,
grab Sawzalls.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.356
We need to disassemble
the exhaust.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.066
Dawson!

08:04.151 --> 08:06.277
Just...

08:06.361 --> 08:08.487
Herrmann, Dawson,
Cruz, and Otis,

08:08.572 --> 08:10.781
hook two come alongs
from the front of the frame
to the back.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.784
Mouch, build a high point
in the middle with cribbing.
Got it.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.915
Hi. Allison, right?
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.083
I'm Sylvie.

08:36.433 --> 08:37.766
Okay. We're good.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.771
Set?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.273
I got it, Herrmann.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.786
Hey, hey,
I know it's loud.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.663
That sound is normal,
I swear.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.248
No, I smell gas!

09:06.087 --> 09:07.504
Casey! Severide!

09:07.672 --> 09:09.173
Yeah, we know!
Keep going.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.475
All right, hold, hold.
Good.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.279
Yeah.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.291
Hey. Nice work, brother.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.335
Good stuff.
Nice work, man.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.212
Nice stuff. Awesome job.
Good job.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.172
Hey. Nice job.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.722
You got a minute?

09:58.848 --> 09:59.974
Yeah, sure, Mouch.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.725
Uh, before I get you
that paperwork,

10:01.810 --> 10:05.271
uh, I would be remiss
if I didn't say something.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.442
You ever throw a pot?

10:11.528 --> 10:14.280
What?
You know, like pottery,
on a wheel.

10:14.364 --> 10:17.116
No.
Trudy and I took a class.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.077
That whole Ghost thing.
Very sensual.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.870
Ah.
Anyway.

10:21.997 --> 10:25.165
You throw a pot, see,
and it looks pretty good.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.877
But you only have
a short while
to make adjustments

10:28.962 --> 10:30.421
before it dries.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.756
Is it really
the pot for you?

10:33.174 --> 10:35.592
Maybe you're looking
for something rounder.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.012
You gotta decide quick,

10:38.722 --> 10:40.848
before that pot dries

10:41.141 --> 10:42.683
and it's yours forever.

10:45.770 --> 10:49.023
So you're saying
marriage is like a pot?

10:49.232 --> 10:51.442
Yes. Yes!

10:52.569 --> 10:54.945
And nothing's
dried yet, Kelly.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.489
Do you follow
what I'm saying?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.658
Mouch, you ever
been married?

11:00.660 --> 11:02.202
Not personally, no.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.543
All right, thanks, man.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.669
Psst!

11:11.254 --> 11:12.338
Lieutenant.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.424
How long you got?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.176
How long I got to what?

11:17.260 --> 11:19.762
Till this, uh,
Severide marriage
flames out.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.847
Otis, don't be a dick.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.434
Okay. If you don't
want in on the action...

11:30.231 --> 11:32.983
All right, just give me
five bucks on six weeks.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.193
There it is.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.407
So, uh, Lieutenant,

11:41.284 --> 11:44.370
just tell us a little more
about this, uh,
crazy wedding of yours, huh?

11:44.454 --> 11:47.498
Start at the beginning.
We want every detail.

11:47.582 --> 11:51.168
Who are you, my Aunt Ruth?
We said, "Let's get married,"
we got married.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.586
When is she gonna
be here already?

11:53.088 --> 11:54.546
She'll be here.
All right?

11:54.631 --> 11:56.298
She'll be here.
Don't worry.

12:00.261 --> 12:03.138
Well, you gotta admit,
he's happy.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.434
She's a graphic artist,
we met at the craps table,

12:07.519 --> 12:09.228
her name is Brittany,
and she's from Florida?

12:09.312 --> 12:11.522
You know what that
adds up to? Stripper.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.565
What do you have
against Florida?

12:14.651 --> 12:17.403
Are you seriously accepting
all this as normal?

12:17.487 --> 12:20.614
I mean,
when has he ever
high-fived anyone,

12:20.698 --> 12:21.990
let alone the entire house?

12:22.492 --> 12:23.992
Gabby, he's happy.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.953
Who cares
how he got there?

12:27.872 --> 12:30.290
I am asking you to find out
what is going on with him.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.126
And I'm telling you,
I saw the look
in his eye.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.503
And when
Kelly gets like this,
he don't listen to nobody.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.173
Who has his ear?
Who can get through
to him?

12:45.390 --> 12:46.557
Shay.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.108
God, these calls
are wiping me out.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.734
I need to
get back in shape.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.486
Yeah, you're looking
like you're in trouble.

12:59.571 --> 13:01.613
I'm serious.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.949
Thanks.
No, back at home, when
I was planning the wedding,

13:04.033 --> 13:06.201
I used to do spinning
Mondays and Wednesdays,

13:06.286 --> 13:07.911
power yoga
Tuesdays and Thursdays,

13:08.037 --> 13:10.873
and Box-Blaster on Fridays
and, uh...
Oh, Box-Blaster?

13:11.499 --> 13:13.250
It's a kickboxing workout.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.752
Yeah. Odd name.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.465
That's really
all I did.

13:20.091 --> 13:24.636
Working out and making sure
dinner was ready by the time
Harrison got home.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.307
You know, we got
a heavy bag

13:28.391 --> 13:30.142
and some weights
at the house,
if you want to.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.185
I could...
Oh!

13:31.269 --> 13:32.936
Do you guys have
Zumba classes in Chicago?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.063
I do not know
what that is.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.316
Never mind.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.109
I'll figure it out.

13:40.403 --> 13:43.947
So, is this, like,
a regular thing
with Severide?

13:44.741 --> 13:47.117
The, uh, running off
and getting married deal?

13:47.285 --> 13:50.078
As far as I know,
this is the first.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.832
Just curious.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.335
- Ambulance 61.
- Two vehicle accident.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.086
Corner of
Jackson and Rose.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.186
Thank God you're here.

14:15.605 --> 14:16.772
Right this way.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.149
Let me take a look
at that bump.

14:19.234 --> 14:21.652
Are you hurt, sir?
Nah, nah. It's all good.

14:21.736 --> 14:23.028
Oh, the only
injury he has

14:23.112 --> 14:25.113
is the brain cells he killed
with whatever he drank.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.032
No way, dude.
Totally sober.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.535
I told the lady, let's just
exchange information.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.537
But I know
the police don't come
to a minor accident

14:31.621 --> 14:33.121
unless you report
an injury.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.166
That's right.
The police are
on their way now.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.338
Just...
Why don't you go ahead
and take a seat?

14:41.422 --> 14:42.756
All right.
Relax.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.466
Tell me what happened.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.723
Hey, hey, Sylvie.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.976
That act
won't save you.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.315
That's crack.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.779
Okay. Hold on.
Oh, God.

15:09.826 --> 15:09.992
He's seizing.
Take that off.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.952
He's seizing.
Take that off.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.206
Oh, God.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.666
Could you...
Okay.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.463
V-fib.
Charging.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.133
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Clear!

15:28.720 --> 15:30.387
I got a rhythm back.

15:30.513 --> 15:31.972
What does that mean?
Is he okay?
Ma'am.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.516
Can you please just
step back, give us
some room? Thank you.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.892
He's still really tacky.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.603
Can we push Midazolam?

15:37.687 --> 15:39.938
I mean, I know it won't
stop him from metabolizing
the crack.

15:40.023 --> 15:43.150
Yeah, but it will
slow down the seizing.
Yeah, let's do it.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.287
Okay.
Oh, look, he's waking up.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.465
Guess he's not
metabolizing it anymore.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.384
Ugh!

16:12.597 --> 16:13.805
Hey, Mills.
Hey.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.474
How's it going?

16:15.558 --> 16:16.516
It's good.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.477
You?
Great.

16:18.561 --> 16:21.063
Hey, listen, man.
I, uh, I need a favor.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.565
Uh, can you help me out
with something tomorrow?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.984
I'm not gonna be
target-practice again,
am I?

16:26.069 --> 16:28.403
No, that was, like,
a one in a million thing.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.031
I just need you to
stand by the car and
wait while I go see someone.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.742
And that's it?
Just stand by the car?
Yeah.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.452
That's all.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.623
What the hell's
going on with you, man?
Nothing. It's nothing.

16:39.707 --> 16:40.832
All right?
It's like I told you.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.502
It's a little minor thing
I need to straighten out.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.420
So, can I count on you?

16:46.756 --> 16:48.757
Yeah, sure.
Thanks, buddy.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.016
Ugh!
Whoa.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.521
Whoa! What happened here?

17:02.605 --> 17:05.107
Oh, come on, admit it.
You miss this.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.358
Yeah.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.777
Yeah, the jealousy
is just overwhelming.

17:08.945 --> 17:11.363
Hey. Excuse me.

17:11.447 --> 17:12.614
Hi.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.199
I'm Brittany.
I'm, uh...

17:14.283 --> 17:16.451
I'm looking
for Kelly Severide.
I'm his...

17:16.536 --> 17:17.953
Oh, you're his wife!

17:18.037 --> 17:20.038
Yeah.
Hi. I'm Gabby Dawson.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.456
Uh, hi. Wow.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.916
Oh, Dawson!

17:23.000 --> 17:25.210
You're the roommate, right?
Uh, sort of.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.294
Yeah, Kelly told me
all about you.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.964
Said you're shaping up to be
one hell of a firefighter.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.674
He said that?

17:31.634 --> 17:32.676
Huh.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.511
Oh, sorry.
This is Sylvie Brett.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.471
She's, uh, one of
the paramedics
on Ambulance 61.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.432
This is Brittany...
Uh, Baker.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.517
Bak... Or, uh...
Or Baker-Severide.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.768
We haven't quite
worked that out yet.

17:41.853 --> 17:44.688
Uh, I'd shake your hand,
but I'm, uh...

17:45.773 --> 17:46.898
It was a patient.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.817
Wasn't out partying
or anything.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.068
Obviously. I mean...

17:50.153 --> 17:52.195
We had an ingestion OD,
which basically means

17:52.280 --> 17:54.865
a guy ate
a whole bunch of crack
and he was...

17:54.949 --> 17:56.533
Suddenly I'm realizing
you don't wanna hear
any of this.

17:56.659 --> 17:59.619
I'm gonna go
and shower now.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.288
But, uh,
you know, welcome.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.833
And, uh, congratulations
and all.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.670
Thank you.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.715
So, come on in.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.763
Guess who I found!

18:18.765 --> 18:21.016
- Hey!
- Hi.

18:23.686 --> 18:26.438
Hey, everybody,
this is Brittany.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.231
Hey!

18:29.692 --> 18:31.276
Welcome.
What you got here?

18:31.360 --> 18:32.486
Uh, well, I read
an article that said

18:32.570 --> 18:34.154
when you come
to a firehouse
for the first time,

18:34.238 --> 18:35.739
come knocking
with your elbows.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.783
What?
All right.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.284
Because your arms
are full of food.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.036
You know,
most people overthink it.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.205
They get those
fancy popovers,

18:43.289 --> 18:45.791
and muffins
with frosting, and...
Cream puffs.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.668
Now, I myself enjoy
the occasional puff,
but in mass...

18:48.753 --> 18:50.295
They get soggy!
Exactly.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.590
Oh, wow! Hi!

18:54.008 --> 18:55.217
And who are you?

18:55.301 --> 18:56.927
Who is this?

18:57.011 --> 18:59.638
Oh, that's Pouch.
Why, hello.
Oh, my God!

18:59.722 --> 19:03.308
Hey! That's the official 51
seal of approval right there.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.726
I am honored!

19:06.229 --> 19:10.982
So, um,
I'm guessing you guys
heard "Vegas wedding,

19:11.400 --> 19:14.027
"met at the craps table"
and thought...
Stripper.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.987
Hey! Capp! Not cool.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.573
No, no. No, actually,
I don't blame him.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.283
It sounds crazy to me,
and I was there.

19:20.368 --> 19:23.537
But, uh... But it's been...
It's been really great.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.164
Well, this calls
for a celebration.

19:26.249 --> 19:27.457
Friday night, Molly's.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.835
Oh, yeah. Hell, yeah!
Friday night at Molly's!

19:29.919 --> 19:32.629
And I'll tell you what.
15% off all the drinks

19:32.713 --> 19:34.756
in honor of
the happy couple here.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.132
Congratulations.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.134
This is so bizarre.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.930
Hey.
Hi. Brittany.
Nice to meet you.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.933
Hey. Um, thanks for letting
Brittany move in.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.269
We won't take long
to find a place.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.437
Yeah, of course.

19:50.273 --> 19:51.606
Appreciate it.

19:53.568 --> 19:55.151
She's moving
into our house?

19:55.236 --> 19:57.445
Remind me to tell you
that Brittany is
moving in with us.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.240
What... We don't even
know who she is.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.700
He doesn't even know
who she is.

20:01.784 --> 20:04.119
What, you, you think
he married a serial killer?

20:05.121 --> 20:06.705
Why are you
so okay with this?

20:06.789 --> 20:09.082
Severide's a big boy.
He can do what he wants.

20:11.252 --> 20:14.421
Look, however
this plays out,
good or bad,

20:14.505 --> 20:16.256
he's gonna need me
on his side.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.008
So you can do
what you want,

20:18.134 --> 20:20.051
but that's where
I'm gonna be.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.690
Hey, congratulations again.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.818
Thanks. And thanks
for letting her
crash for a while.

20:37.445 --> 20:38.570
Hmm.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.531
Are you okay?

20:42.283 --> 20:43.783
Yeah.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.577
I'm better than okay.
I'm great.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.998
It just seems
like ever since...

20:51.334 --> 20:53.460
Ever since Shay died,
you've been avoiding...

20:53.544 --> 20:55.587
Why can't you just be happy
that I'm happy, Dawson?

20:56.672 --> 20:58.798
Because I'm not sure
that you are happy.

21:00.301 --> 21:02.636
And I think...
I think maybe
that you're hiding.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.472
And I know that Shay
wouldn't want that for you.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.349
Yeah?

21:09.352 --> 21:11.561
You think she'd want
you putting your wedding
on hold forever?

21:11.687 --> 21:14.105
No, that's
completely different...
Look.

21:14.315 --> 21:17.609
Some people,
they get married
when they know it's right,

21:17.693 --> 21:18.735
however quick it is.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.071
And some people,
they put it off.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.907
Maybe you're doing
what's right
for you and Matt.

21:23.991 --> 21:27.327
Just, before you accuse
anyone of hiding,

21:29.080 --> 21:31.081
check and make sure
you're not doing
that yourself.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.349
I'll just be a minute.

22:04.782 --> 22:08.284
I just came by
to tell you I'm done.
You're done?

22:08.369 --> 22:11.496
Anybody can see
the only way this goes
is south. So I'm out.

22:37.314 --> 22:38.690
Done.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.400
Why are you putting
a tracker on this guy's car?

22:40.484 --> 22:42.318
Look, you worry too much.
Get in the car.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.533
Mmm-hmm. Mmm.

22:48.617 --> 22:49.743
So...

22:51.203 --> 22:53.288
I told my mom.
And?

22:53.914 --> 22:55.248
She cried.

22:57.168 --> 23:00.003
Like, good cried
or bad cried?

23:01.297 --> 23:04.591
Half "Sad
I wasn't there" cry,

23:04.675 --> 23:08.136
and half "Happy at least
my daughter is married" cry.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.806
We should fly her up,
when we get our place.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.559
Like, have
a little reception?

23:15.019 --> 23:16.644
Yeah. Just family.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.774
Yeah. Yeah, for family.

23:27.198 --> 23:28.490
Hey.

23:29.784 --> 23:32.702
Hey. Hi.

23:35.498 --> 23:36.664
So are we nuts?

23:41.378 --> 23:43.838
Nah. Mmm. Maybe.

23:54.517 --> 23:56.643
Oh. Good.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.688
Hi. You're new here,
aren't you?

24:01.190 --> 24:03.274
Oh, I've taken a couple
of Zumba classes,

24:03.359 --> 24:04.984
but this is
my first class here.

24:05.069 --> 24:07.862
Well, the instructor
is awesome.
You're gonna love it.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.197
Oh.

24:12.034 --> 24:13.868
Here we go!

24:13.953 --> 24:16.121
All right, ladies!

24:16.205 --> 24:18.873
Who's ready to sweat?

24:19.458 --> 24:21.709
Oh! Here we go!

24:23.045 --> 24:24.546
Pump those arms!

24:27.842 --> 24:29.717
We're going this way!

24:31.345 --> 24:32.470
Oh!

24:34.598 --> 24:35.807
Hey!

24:42.565 --> 24:44.065
Uh, hey, Tina?

24:44.150 --> 24:46.192
Can you take over
for a second?

24:46.485 --> 24:47.819
Uh, Miss?

24:47.903 --> 24:49.279
New girl!

24:49.363 --> 24:51.489
Can I see you over here
for a moment?

24:51.907 --> 24:53.491
There you go, ladies!

24:53.576 --> 24:55.243
Making it happen!

24:55.327 --> 24:56.619
Looking good!

24:57.163 --> 24:58.413
Who sent you?

24:58.497 --> 24:59.956
Nobody.
Who knows?

25:00.040 --> 25:01.207
Nobody!

25:01.834 --> 25:03.626
You mean to tell me
that you just came
to a Zumba class

25:03.711 --> 25:05.211
in Pilsen,
on your own?

25:05.296 --> 25:06.588
I live here.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.840
Well, you're just gonna
have to leave, right now.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.259
But this is the best-rated
Zumba class on Yelp!

25:12.636 --> 25:14.721
Okay, well, what's it
gonna take to keep you
quiet about this?

25:16.682 --> 25:17.849
Let me teach you to cook.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.728
What?
You have a food truck
that needs a cook.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.688
I have skills
I have nowhere to use.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.440
Wait. So cook
for the house!

25:25.566 --> 25:26.733
No, I wanna cook when I say.

25:26.817 --> 25:29.611
I do not want
anyone asking me,
"When's dinner ready?" Ever.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.071
But for Molly's II...
Wait.

25:32.156 --> 25:34.532
Hold on.
Let me get this straight.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.702
In order to keep you
from outing me,

25:37.786 --> 25:40.163
I have to allow you
to cook for me?

25:41.624 --> 25:42.832
Yes.

25:42.917 --> 25:46.794
You are...
You, you're like...

25:47.796 --> 25:49.339
Like, perfect.

25:50.341 --> 25:51.633
Deal?

25:52.259 --> 25:53.635
Absolutely.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.684
All right, ladies!

26:02.269 --> 26:03.895
One more time, yeah!

26:03.979 --> 26:06.022
Oh! Oh!

26:06.106 --> 26:07.982
Here we go again! Yeah!

26:09.151 --> 26:11.527
Pass the cheese?
Mmm-hmm.

26:12.321 --> 26:13.571
Thanks.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.241
Want some hot sauce?

26:16.325 --> 26:17.700
Nah.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.496
There they are!

26:22.164 --> 26:23.289
How's it going?

26:23.374 --> 26:24.582
Good.

26:26.210 --> 26:27.293
Is that all you have?

26:27.378 --> 26:30.004
Yeah, I, came straight here
with the bags I packed
for Vegas.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.840
I'm gonna get my friends
to send me some more clothes.

26:32.925 --> 26:36.928
Otherwise, I'm gonna be
wearing a lot of bikinis.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.346
Oh.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.891
Welcome.
Thank you so much,

26:41.976 --> 26:44.018
so much for letting me
stay here.

26:46.397 --> 26:47.939
Baby.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.608
Baby, grab my bag,
grab my bag!
Oh, it's back here.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.123
I'll give them a week
and then tell Severide
they gotta...

27:05.207 --> 27:06.332
I like her.

27:06.834 --> 27:09.252
What?
When did this happen?

27:11.380 --> 27:13.756
Like you said,
he's happy.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.384
What do I know?

27:17.761 --> 27:19.053
You want a beer?

27:20.597 --> 27:21.723
Sure.

27:28.022 --> 27:30.023
I think...

27:31.191 --> 27:33.568
I think part of me
is a little jealous.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.238
I mean, he gets to do
what he wants.

27:38.240 --> 27:41.200
Meet a girl, get married,
put it all out there
for the world.

27:42.578 --> 27:46.247
I just get tired of all
the sneaking around
and pretending.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.542
Have you been
talking to Severide?

27:50.711 --> 27:51.919
No, why?

27:53.255 --> 27:54.964
Nothing. I just...

27:57.634 --> 27:59.594
I mean, you know
I hate it, too, right?

27:59.678 --> 28:00.720
I know.

28:00.846 --> 28:03.056
As long as you and I
are both on 81, what...
I know, I know.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.558
This isn't your fault.
This isn't anyone's fault.

28:09.229 --> 28:10.521
It just sucks.

28:12.775 --> 28:13.983
Yeah.

28:17.112 --> 28:19.280
And sometimes I wish we
could just fly off to Vegas

28:19.365 --> 28:21.574
and get the rest of
our lives started.

28:23.994 --> 28:26.329
You know I would
in a second if I could.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.206
Me, too.

28:35.172 --> 28:38.049
Baby!

28:42.805 --> 28:46.599
So the first thing
we need here is your
marriage certificate.

28:47.393 --> 28:48.518
Got it. Uh...

28:49.311 --> 28:50.686
Right here.

28:53.649 --> 28:56.734
Uh, it's got a little
margarita spilled on it,
but everything's clear.

28:56.819 --> 28:57.902
Okay.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.654
We can make
a copy of that.

28:59.780 --> 29:05.076
So these two are
for your non-major benefits,
prescriptions and the like.

29:05.160 --> 29:09.247
This one goes to personnel,
and this one goes
to the insurance company.

29:09.331 --> 29:13.167
Then these two
are life insurance
and pension forms,

29:13.252 --> 29:16.546
and they both go
to the pension
benefits department.

29:16.630 --> 29:19.090
Then,
for major medical...

29:22.719 --> 29:24.345
You know what?

29:24.930 --> 29:27.265
Let me get these
filed for you.

29:27.349 --> 29:29.767
Really?
Consider it my wedding gift.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.228
Congratulations, Severide.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.480
May you know only happiness
from this day forward.

29:36.442 --> 29:40.153
Hey, how many weeks
you have us down for
in the pool?

29:42.364 --> 29:43.614
Three.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.491
Gonna prove you wrong, Chief.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.119
I hope you do.

29:48.370 --> 29:49.454
Thanks, Chief.

29:53.834 --> 29:56.002
Three, huh?
How many you have?

29:56.503 --> 29:57.712
Just one.

30:02.384 --> 30:03.718
Yo.
Yeah?

30:04.636 --> 30:05.887
Come here for a sec.

30:07.014 --> 30:08.097
All right.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.729
Your misunderstanding
struck again, man.
And this time it left a note.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.984
"I see you again
and you're dead."

30:20.110 --> 30:21.944
Mills...
Yo, this is happening
at the house.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.030
If Boden finds out
about this, you're gone,
and that's...

30:24.114 --> 30:25.656
I hear you, man.
Come here.

30:26.617 --> 30:28.242
What the hell is it
with you and this guy, man?

30:30.037 --> 30:31.704
His name is Jake Williams.

30:31.788 --> 30:35.208
He has outstanding warrants
for larceny and assault
in Wisconsin.

30:35.459 --> 30:39.212
Okay? If I can
tail or track this guy
back across state line,

30:39.671 --> 30:41.589
I can pick him up
and clear 2,000.

30:42.925 --> 30:45.676
You were messing with
this felon for two grand?
You have a daughter.

30:45.761 --> 30:47.220
Come on, man!
I know I have a daughter,

30:47.304 --> 30:48.721
who has worked her ass off

30:48.805 --> 30:50.890
to help her team get to
finals and a trip to DC.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.934
That's gonna cost me 1,500.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.727
I can't let her down!

30:54.811 --> 30:58.981
Hey, better you
let her down than get
yourself killed, okay?

30:59.066 --> 31:02.568
Now I'm telling you this,
face to face,
you end this, now!

31:08.200 --> 31:12.245
Engine 51, Truck 81,
Squad 3, Ambulance 61.

31:12.329 --> 31:14.622
House fire,
871 Carver Drive.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.054
You have to get Andrew,
Mr. Lewellen.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.889
Is he the resident?
Yes.

31:31.974 --> 31:35.101
Uh, he lives by himself
with his dog Paco.
I saw him bring Paco out

31:35.185 --> 31:36.852
and then go into the cellar.

31:36.937 --> 31:38.688
It's right down here.
Hey, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

31:38.772 --> 31:39.981
Go back.

31:41.149 --> 31:42.984
Let's do
a primary search
of the cellar.

31:46.488 --> 31:48.281
We'll have to find
a new entry.

31:48.365 --> 31:50.366
Cellar entrance
is compromised.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.743
- Hey, Chief, we got a window!
- Go!

31:52.828 --> 31:55.454
Newhouse, Tony,
I need ladder at entry!

31:55.539 --> 31:56.747
Come on, hustle.

31:56.832 --> 31:58.165
Help him out.

32:02.337 --> 32:03.838
- Come on, hustle.
- Got it.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.506
Newhouse go through.

32:13.890 --> 32:16.058
Keep it back
and provide cover.

32:26.403 --> 32:29.030
Fire Department!
Call out!

32:31.533 --> 32:33.743
Fire Department!
Call out!

32:38.749 --> 32:40.875
Hey, Chief,
I found the resident.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.501
He's pretty badly burned.

32:42.628 --> 32:45.421
Hey, bud, let's get
you out of here!

33:01.563 --> 33:04.065
All right, buddy.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.193
Hey!

33:09.237 --> 33:10.738
All right,
I'm sending him up!

33:25.212 --> 33:26.587
Ah, man.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.224
Severide.

33:40.102 --> 33:41.852
Everything all right
down there?

33:42.729 --> 33:44.146
Negative.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.899
I'm okay, Chief,
but we need to
seal this room off.

33:47.609 --> 33:48.984
Why? What'd you find?

33:50.529 --> 33:52.613
Make sure everybody knows,

33:52.698 --> 33:54.699
nobody touches anything.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.117
Get the cops here. Now.

33:58.787 --> 34:00.329
So, what do we got?

34:00.706 --> 34:03.541
This fell out
of the guy's hands when
he was being hauled up.

34:03.625 --> 34:06.460
I'm pretty sure this is
what he came down to get.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.588
Guy's hands?
What guy's hands?
Home owner?

34:09.673 --> 34:10.798
I don't know
if he owned the place,

34:10.882 --> 34:13.050
but I'm pretty sure
he owned the box.

34:13.135 --> 34:14.218
Where is he now?

34:14.302 --> 34:16.387
My guess,
halfway to Chicago Med.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.973
He was pretty banged up
when they loaded him
into the ambo.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.892
Hey, call dispatch,
get a 20
on that ambulance.

34:21.977 --> 34:24.854
I want somebody
with that guy when they
roll into Chicago Med.

34:33.822 --> 34:35.656
So you didn't touch the box
or its contents?

34:35.991 --> 34:37.324
No.

34:37.617 --> 34:38.784
Didn't open it?

34:39.244 --> 34:40.661
Pretty hard to do
without touching it.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.998
We just have to ask
these questions for
chain of evidence, Kelly.

34:45.834 --> 34:47.001
I didn't open the box.

34:53.258 --> 34:54.675
Those kids look
pretty young.

35:04.519 --> 35:06.520
- Mmm.
- Oh, God.

35:15.489 --> 35:16.864
Hey, Lieutenant.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.991
You don't work for me
anymore, Mills.

35:19.701 --> 35:22.369
Hey, Matt.
There you go. What's up?

35:23.580 --> 35:25.372
We need to
help out Newhouse.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.385
What is that?

35:38.553 --> 35:40.721
That is oven fried ravioli

35:40.806 --> 35:43.974
with crispy sage
and pancetta.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.811
You made those?
Hell, no. Brett did.

35:46.895 --> 35:48.479
But she's showing me how.

35:48.563 --> 35:51.732
And it's a perfect
Molly's II signature dish.

35:51.817 --> 35:54.985
Portable, delicious.
It's a lot like bar food.

35:55.070 --> 35:57.905
But with
a sophistication all its own.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.825
It doesn't smell half bad,
I'll give you that.

36:00.909 --> 36:02.785
And Brett's got
these things
down to a science.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.871
We can knock these out
in the truck, to order,
no problem.

36:05.956 --> 36:09.583
Okay, I'm going in.

36:20.345 --> 36:21.387
Huh?

36:26.810 --> 36:28.936
Ladies and gentlemen,

36:29.020 --> 36:32.189
we have a new house chef!

36:32.274 --> 36:34.149
Get out.
Wait, what?

36:34.234 --> 36:36.986
You think we're gonna
eat the swill these
chuckleheads make

36:37.070 --> 36:38.612
when we have someone
who can cook like this?

36:38.697 --> 36:41.198
Yeah.
Mmm! All right, Brett!

36:41.283 --> 36:42.616
When's dinner?

36:42.701 --> 36:44.535
Oh. Uh...

36:45.412 --> 36:47.538
You know, um, guys...

36:47.622 --> 36:49.206
We don't use
the fine china every day.

36:49.291 --> 36:51.208
Well, you would
if it tasted like this.
Wow.

36:51.293 --> 36:54.253
We need to
keep Brett's genius
focused on Molly's II.

36:55.005 --> 36:57.464
What's wrong with you?
Just trust me on this one.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.801
Yeah. Okay, Brett.

37:01.303 --> 37:04.013
No chow duty for you.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.314
This is grim.

37:14.649 --> 37:15.858
Yeah.

37:18.612 --> 37:21.989
So, uh, the federal kiddie
porn databases...
Mmm-hmm.

37:22.115 --> 37:24.909
They search for the kid
and for the background

37:24.993 --> 37:28.120
so that they can
identify the work
of different offenders,

37:28.204 --> 37:30.122
so I figured we'd do
the same thing.

37:34.461 --> 37:35.586
Oh, my God.

37:36.421 --> 37:37.588
What?

37:41.009 --> 37:42.176
Oh, my God.

37:51.561 --> 37:52.811
Uh.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.522
When's the last time
you heard from him?

37:58.526 --> 37:59.860
Ten years?

38:02.322 --> 38:04.114
You know how old
he is in that photo?

38:08.119 --> 38:11.288
I mean, 15 maybe.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.503
He took off for New York
not long after that.

38:19.047 --> 38:20.589
Hey, come here.

38:21.383 --> 38:22.967
Come here.

38:29.265 --> 38:31.976
We'll send it off
to Manhattan SVU.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.979
Yeah.
We'll see if they got
anything on him.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.606
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.823
Rollins.
Did you get
the files I sent?

38:46.157 --> 38:48.492
Um, yeah. Thank you.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.035
And, uh, did I hear right?

38:50.120 --> 38:52.788
You've got history
with one of the vics
in the photos?

38:52.872 --> 38:54.915
Um, a Ted Courtney?

38:55.500 --> 38:56.750
Yeah, uh...

38:59.504 --> 39:00.587
He's my brother.

39:05.260 --> 39:06.510
Erin, I'm sorry.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.096
It's okay.

39:09.931 --> 39:11.098
No, it's...

39:12.267 --> 39:17.062
It's not. Um, well, listen.
We got database hits on

39:17.397 --> 39:19.148
a couple of the other vics
in the photos.

39:19.232 --> 39:21.108
All New York missings.

39:24.154 --> 39:25.738
I don't know how your brother
got mixed up in this,

39:25.822 --> 39:27.906
but we're gonna get
to the bottom of it, okay?

39:28.992 --> 39:31.577
Listen, I'd like
to come and help out.

39:32.245 --> 39:33.704
I've already cleared it
with my boss,

39:33.788 --> 39:35.497
so if it's
all right with you...

39:36.750 --> 39:38.625
I guess we'll be
seeing you soon.

39:39.294 --> 39:40.586
All right.

39:51.431 --> 39:53.223
Get some money out here!

39:53.308 --> 39:54.975
Give me your credit card.

39:56.478 --> 39:57.519
Newhouse!

39:59.272 --> 40:02.232
Come here! Tell Naomi
to have a great time in DC.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.195
What's this?
Passed the boot.

40:07.155 --> 40:08.447
You serious?
Yeah.

40:08.531 --> 40:11.617
Well, it was either that
or have the guys eat
500 candy bars.

40:12.535 --> 40:14.369
This seemed like
the better plan.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.665
Uh, Mills.
This your doing?

40:26.549 --> 40:28.050
I don't know what to say.

40:33.515 --> 40:35.140
Thank you. All of you.

40:35.225 --> 40:36.809
Hey, we're 51.

40:36.893 --> 40:37.935
We take care
of our family, man.

40:38.019 --> 40:39.394
51!

40:40.355 --> 40:41.688
51.

40:45.735 --> 40:48.237
Sorry.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.366
It just hits me sometimes.

40:54.369 --> 40:55.536
I know.

40:57.038 --> 40:58.372
Me, too.

41:06.422 --> 41:08.215
You saved my life,
you know that?

41:11.761 --> 41:13.262
We saved each other.

41:24.232 --> 41:25.399
Come on.
Let's go home.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.484
No. No.

41:27.569 --> 41:29.862
Your friends
threw a party for us.
Let's go inside.

41:29.946 --> 41:32.322
You don't have to.
You don't have to.
I want to.

41:37.078 --> 41:38.162
You sure?

41:38.329 --> 41:40.914
Sure I wanna celebrate
marrying you? Yeah.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.292
Yeah, so badly,
it's not even funny.
