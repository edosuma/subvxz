01:52.362 --> 01:53.739
What's the matter, dear?

01:55.449 --> 01:56.450
I can't write.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.369
Oh, blimey.
I never thought I'd hear ya say that.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.831
Ever since I gave him one of my poems.

02:02.915 --> 02:03.916
Gave who?

02:04.583 --> 02:06.502
Mr. Bowles.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.878
Two weeks ago, I submitted.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.714
Oh, God, isn't that an awful word?

02:10.797 --> 02:14.468
"Submission." Like he controls me.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.094
Like he's my master.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.472
Some people get
a kick out of that sort of thing.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.350
Never mind. Why can't you write then?

02:21.433 --> 02:24.770
Because what's the point of ever writing
another poem if he rejects this one?

02:24.853 --> 02:26.605
How do you know he'll reject it?

02:28.357 --> 02:29.358
Well, I don't know.

02:29.942 --> 02:31.193
I don't know anything.

02:31.693 --> 02:34.279
I don't know when I'll know.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.783
God, my life is completely stuck.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.368
This was a huge mistake.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.161
I'm sure he just hasn't read it yet.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.497
He's a busy man. He'll get around to it.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.999
Yeah, and by that time,
I'll have shriveled up and died.

02:46.542 --> 02:47.543
Emily?

02:48.210 --> 02:49.461
Emily, what's the matter?

02:49.878 --> 02:51.713
I could hear your moaning
from all the way upstairs.

02:51.797 --> 02:52.798
I'm empty.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.760
Dried up. Void.

02:58.679 --> 02:59.888
A useless husk.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.476
She's got writer's block.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.204
Maggie, did you tell your brothers
we needed another outhouse?

03:24.288 --> 03:25.289
No, ma'am.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.249
Then how on earth
do you explain this hole?

03:27.708 --> 03:30.502
I think this might be the work
of our new young houseguests.

03:30.586 --> 03:33.505
I saw the two of them yesterday
hanging around the toolshed.

03:33.589 --> 03:36.425
What? No, the girls couldn't have
dug this hole. It's way too massive.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.802
I don't think you know
what young girls are capable of.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.013
Edward, we can't have
them living in our house anymore.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.640
The Newman girls didn't dig this hole.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.268
Your sister and brother-in-law
must've spoiled them rotten.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.352
Well, they are from Brooklyn.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.729
That's no excuse.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.398
I feel just like that kitten,

03:51.481 --> 03:53.483
stuck in a deep hole with no way out.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.694
Why don't you try writing a limerick?

03:57.362 --> 03:58.947
Edward, we need to have a discussion.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.532
No. Later, dear. I'm going birding.

04:00.616 --> 04:01.825
No, this conversation cannot wait.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.744
I am telling you,
those girls are out of control.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.287
They'll burn our house down
if we let them.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.997
Yes. Well, then don't let them.

04:08.332 --> 04:11.502
Now, there's a yellow-rumped warbler
that needs my attention.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.836
Well, I need your attention.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.505
Dad, can I go birding with you?

04:15.172 --> 04:16.255
I need to clear my head.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.507
That's a marvelous idea.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.676
I thought the doctor told you
you had to stay out of the sun.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.969
No, doctor was a quack.

04:21.053 --> 04:22.137
Come on. Let's go.

04:27.351 --> 04:29.269
Me brothers can get the cat out.

04:29.353 --> 04:31.980
Poor thing. What's that one's name?

04:32.439 --> 04:34.650
I believe that's Drummydoodles.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.152
Oh, no. He's the biter.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.618
Do you think my parents notice
that you're always in my room?

04:44.701 --> 04:47.162
I don't know. Should we be worried?
Maybe we should stop.

04:47.246 --> 04:48.539
-No. It's hot.
-No?

04:48.622 --> 04:50.082
-I love breaking the rules.
-Okay.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.219
-It's not working.
-Yeah.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.804
Just give me a second.

05:03.887 --> 05:04.888
-It's-- Okay.
-Okay.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.982
-It's, like, not doing anything.
-Yeah.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.110
Maybe that's because
we shouldn't even be doing this.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.945
What do you mean?
You're not enjoying yourself?

05:20.028 --> 05:22.906
No, I am enjoying myself.
I'm enjoying myself too much.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.451
It shouldn't be like this.
It's totally improper.

05:26.535 --> 05:27.953
-Yeah.
-No.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.622
I'm trying to follow etiquette.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.416
Do it the polite way.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.127
But every time I try to give you
a simple kiss on the hand,

05:35.210 --> 05:36.879
you try to push me back into bed.

05:38.172 --> 05:41.967
I don't know.
Honestly, I'm starting to feel kinda used.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.051
-Excuse me?
-Yeah.

05:43.135 --> 05:45.387
And I hate it
when women make me feel like this.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.806
Like they just want me for my body.

05:47.890 --> 05:48.891
What women?

05:50.267 --> 05:51.268
Wait.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.812
Are you talking about Lola?

05:54.730 --> 05:55.772
Oh, God.

05:56.481 --> 06:00.444
Just the sound of her name brings back
that greasy smell of circus paint,

06:00.527 --> 06:05.657
the crack of her horse whip,
and the wicked thrusts of her...

06:05.741 --> 06:07.659
-Her what?
-Of her spider dance.

06:07.743 --> 06:08.785
Spider dance?

06:08.869 --> 06:12.539
Oh, she wasn't even a trained dancer.
She didn't even have skills.

06:12.623 --> 06:14.791
-Can you tell me more about the spider--
-No. Okay, listen.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.919
I just think that
we are moving way too fast.

06:17.002 --> 06:20.172
This isn't why I came back here.
This is New England, not the Wild West.

06:20.839 --> 06:21.840
I can't...

06:22.716 --> 06:25.344
I can't ever fall for
a girl like Lola again.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.221
I don't have it in me.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.099
That's why I came here for you, Lavinia.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.602
So you're gonna be
the mother of my children.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.522
We're not even engaged.

06:39.483 --> 06:40.484
Oh, shit.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.569
I have an idea.

06:52.496 --> 06:53.497
Look up.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.129
Vermilion flycatcher.

07:04.675 --> 07:06.552
Blue jay. Over here.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.015
Look over there. There he is.

07:12.558 --> 07:13.559
Oh, yeah.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.861
So, is this helping?

07:24.862 --> 07:26.154
Helping what?

07:26.238 --> 07:27.865
I mean, are you feeling better?

07:30.701 --> 07:31.702
No.

07:32.870 --> 07:34.288
I still feel pretty bad.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.581
Is it your vision again?

07:36.707 --> 07:39.877
Yeah. Yeah, my creative vision.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.462
Can't see a thing.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.591
I thought the poems
were just coming and coming.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.551
Yeah. Well, they stopped.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.513
Wish there was something
I could do, but...

07:53.015 --> 07:54.766
I've never had a vision like yours.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.106
There was a cardinal.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.692
Well, there's a fascinating bird.

08:03.775 --> 08:04.776
Where? Which one?

08:04.860 --> 08:06.153
Look, over here. Your brother.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.113
Funny thing about bark is that...

08:09.281 --> 08:11.074
Oh, hey. Dad.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.244
Let me introduce you.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.329
Who is this?

08:15.412 --> 08:20.751
Father, this is the special guest of
the Amherst Ornamental Tree Association,

08:21.126 --> 08:23.754
Mr. Frederick Law Olmsted.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.089
Olmsted.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.008
Dad, this is the man who is designing

08:28.091 --> 08:30.052
the great park
in the center of New York City.

08:30.135 --> 08:34.306
Mr. Olmsted, the park sounds amazing.
I wonder what you're going to call it.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.099
I'm thinking "Central Park."

08:36.642 --> 08:39.102
Perfect. That's perfect.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.688
Well, it's good. It's not great.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.815
Guess what else he's designing?

08:43.899 --> 08:44.900
What?

08:45.317 --> 08:47.402
The Amherst Town Common.

08:47.486 --> 08:48.737
Amazing.

08:48.820 --> 08:49.905
Get out of here.

08:49.988 --> 08:50.989
Get out of here?

08:51.532 --> 08:54.785
No, my good man. No.
Rather, I must do the opposite.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.955
I must get into here.

08:58.956 --> 09:01.583
Watch this. This is his process.

09:02.167 --> 09:06.171
See, I arrive in a place and I listen.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.925
I do not speak to the place.

09:10.551 --> 09:11.969
I let the place speak to me.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.347
And what is the place saying?

09:15.430 --> 09:17.808
I haven't heard it yet. I barely had time.

09:18.517 --> 09:19.560
Yeah.

09:19.643 --> 09:22.980
We've actually been standing
in this exact spot for an hour.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.815
And what is an hour?

09:24.898 --> 09:28.360
In the grand span of the universe,
an hour is nothing.

09:28.443 --> 09:31.238
No, we must throw away all clocks.

09:31.321 --> 09:32.948
Nature has its own time.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.325
Now, I must wander.

09:38.829 --> 09:41.582
He's one of the most interesting people
I've ever met.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.836
Creative genius. Major coup
for the Ornamental Tree Association.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.004
I'm going with him.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.839
Hey, wait. Emily, what are you doing?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.674
I think this man can help me.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.176
I thought I was helping you!

09:53.135 --> 09:54.178
Mr. Olmsted.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.306
I'm useless as a father.

09:58.307 --> 09:59.766
Dad, don't say that.

09:59.850 --> 10:02.686
You raised three kids,
and all of us are turning out just fine.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.354
Oh. Come on.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.482
You're all just hanging by a thread.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.611
Now we've got two new ones
to take care of.

10:11.570 --> 10:12.696
You mean the teens.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.239
Yes.

10:14.323 --> 10:15.908
Yes, the Newman girls.

10:16.325 --> 10:19.077
They've been misbehaving,
and your mother is not pleased.

10:20.329 --> 10:22.080
Well, I have an idea.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.124
Oh, what?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.251
I'll adopt them.

10:29.713 --> 10:30.964
What's that?

10:31.048 --> 10:32.257
I'd love to adopt them.

10:32.758 --> 10:36.053
My heart goes out to them, honestly,
and we have so much space.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.013
We have that nursery upstairs.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.682
The house feels so lonely sometimes.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.518
You sure about this?

10:43.477 --> 10:44.895
It's the least I could do.

10:44.978 --> 10:48.315
I mean, their inheritance
is basically paying for our house.

10:48.398 --> 10:52.027
Well, true, and it would be
a great relief for your mother.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.197
I would love nothing more. I'll take them.

10:57.032 --> 11:00.077
All right. Problem solved.

11:01.453 --> 11:02.454
Hooray.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.790
Now I just have to tell Sue.

11:12.506 --> 11:18.929
And to me, making a park is like
making a painting or a play or a poem.

11:20.389 --> 11:22.558
A poem? Really?

11:23.141 --> 11:25.102
Well, there's absolutely no difference.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.563
I'm an artist. A composer.

11:28.063 --> 11:32.818
It's just that my canvas is the land, and
my verses are made of natural materials.

11:32.901 --> 11:36.405
This rock, for example...

11:36.488 --> 11:39.199
is making exactly the right statement.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.540
Oh, no!

11:46.999 --> 11:48.208
What is it?

11:48.667 --> 11:50.335
This rosebush is a disaster.

11:52.004 --> 11:53.881
What's the matter with this rosebush?

11:55.507 --> 11:56.717
Answer me honestly.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.679
Could you sit beside this rosebush
with a sense of peace?

12:02.306 --> 12:03.307
Maybe.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.434
Maybe's not good enough.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.437
No. Bush will have to go.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.982
Wait a minute. Wait. Let me just try it.

12:21.867 --> 12:22.868
Tell me...

12:23.744 --> 12:27.956
could you sit beside this bush with a book

12:28.832 --> 12:31.543
and feel totally
un-intruded upon by the world?

12:32.169 --> 12:36.548
Could you feel yourself healing from
the abuses of our deafening urban lives?

12:42.930 --> 12:44.431
I'll wait as long as you need.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.069
Gotta be honest. It's a no.

12:57.611 --> 12:58.654
The bush goes.

12:59.238 --> 13:03.075
So, what do you do
when you don't know what to do?

13:03.825 --> 13:05.202
-When I don't know?
-Yeah.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.286
I wait.

13:07.204 --> 13:09.540
-How long?
-That's nice.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.459
As long as it takes.

13:13.210 --> 13:14.711
Months, years.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.258
You must have so much patience.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.677
I'm making art that'll last for centuries.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.554
Generations to come will enjoy my parks.

13:23.637 --> 13:26.682
My parks
could save democracy itself, so...

13:27.641 --> 13:28.642
can't rush that.

13:29.101 --> 13:30.227
Do you ever get stuck?

13:32.271 --> 13:33.522
No, I refuse to be stuck.

13:35.858 --> 13:36.859
Look at that.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.697
Oh, that is some of the finest
Taxus baccata I've ever seen.

13:41.780 --> 13:42.781
Taxus what?

13:42.865 --> 13:43.866
These hedges.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.368
But do they flow?

13:47.119 --> 13:50.163
Do they unfurl effortlessly
like the crest of the wave?

13:50.247 --> 13:51.832
Do they make the heart sing?

13:51.915 --> 13:53.917
America, land of the free,

13:54.543 --> 13:57.629
where all classes may mingle together
as equals, as one.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.632
Come on. Let's go find out.

14:17.649 --> 14:18.650
What?

14:27.701 --> 14:28.702
What the--

14:30.204 --> 14:31.205
My God.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.082
I'm in a hole.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.337
Hello!

14:40.422 --> 14:41.548
Hello?

14:44.843 --> 14:45.844
God's sake.

14:49.640 --> 14:50.641
Hello!

14:57.397 --> 14:59.274
I'm in a hole!

15:00.567 --> 15:01.860
Can you believe it?

15:01.944 --> 15:05.572
Sam tells me he just went
to a salon in Great Barrington

15:05.656 --> 15:07.908
where they had a lecture
by a phrenologist.

15:08.367 --> 15:10.702
Okay. So they felt his bumps.

15:10.786 --> 15:12.788
Phrenologists are so in right now.

15:13.497 --> 15:15.123
We need to step up our game.

15:15.207 --> 15:18.502
I can't be outdone by a salon
in Western Massachusetts.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.087
I know the hostess too.

15:20.170 --> 15:23.090
There's no way that
that woman can even spell phrenologist.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.174
Sue!

15:25.592 --> 15:27.761
There you are. I've got amazing news.

15:27.845 --> 15:28.804
What is it?

15:28.887 --> 15:32.224
Clara and Anna Newman,
my adorable little cousins,

15:33.225 --> 15:36.395
they're going to come and live with us.
Here, at the Evergreens.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.063
Isn't that wonderful?

15:38.438 --> 15:39.857
What are you talking about?

15:39.940 --> 15:43.277
I'm talking about making a home
for these poor children.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.153
You can adopt cousins, can't you?

15:45.237 --> 15:47.239
Austin, you didn't even ask me.

15:47.322 --> 15:48.323
I don't want them here.

15:48.407 --> 15:50.117
But, Sue, they've got nowhere to go.

15:50.576 --> 15:52.119
They're orphans. Homeless.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.788
Like you were
before you became a Dickinson.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.456
Just what I want.

15:56.540 --> 15:59.877
Two living, breathing reminders
of my terrible past.

16:07.634 --> 16:08.635
Sue...

16:09.595 --> 16:10.596
have a heart.

16:11.221 --> 16:12.848
Why do you want them here?

16:12.931 --> 16:13.932
Because...

16:15.601 --> 16:18.437
I want a child.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.813
Austin.

16:19.897 --> 16:24.276
I want a child, and I promised you
I would never ask you to have one.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.695
Well, this is a chance for me

16:26.778 --> 16:30.032
to be a father to these girls
and to keep my promise to you.

16:30.115 --> 16:32.868
And I think you owe it to me
to be excited about it.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.461
Well, it sounds like you've
made your mind up.

16:42.544 --> 16:43.795
So, I guess it's settled.

16:47.758 --> 16:50.010
I suppose you'd better
go make up the nursery.

17:11.365 --> 17:14.952
Oh, bless this day

17:18.372 --> 17:19.373
Help!

17:20.540 --> 17:21.541
Hello?

17:22.626 --> 17:23.794
Hello?

17:23.877 --> 17:26.046
My name is Edward. I'm in a hole.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.216
Edward?

17:29.591 --> 17:30.801
Hello!

17:33.971 --> 17:34.972
Hello?

17:35.931 --> 17:36.932
Hello?

17:37.015 --> 17:38.016
Edward?

17:38.100 --> 17:39.101
Is that you, dear?

17:39.810 --> 17:40.811
Hi.

17:42.354 --> 17:44.064
You found me. Thank heavens.

17:44.523 --> 17:45.649
You fell in the hole!

17:47.568 --> 17:51.280
I know that. I'm in a hole.
Come get me out, for God's sake.

17:55.868 --> 17:57.703
Well, help me out then, woman.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.873
What are you doing? No.

18:00.956 --> 18:02.249
Come on.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.001
Okay, okay.

18:04.793 --> 18:05.794
What have you done?

18:05.878 --> 18:09.506
I'm sorry, but we're having
our discussion now, Edward,

18:09.590 --> 18:10.883
whether you like it or not.

18:10.966 --> 18:12.551
Now is really not a good time.

18:12.634 --> 18:15.387
Now is a perfect time.
For once, you have no means of evading me.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.347
No, I never evade you, Mother.

18:17.973 --> 18:21.059
Edward, I swear,
if you call me mother one more time,

18:21.143 --> 18:23.187
I will bury the two of us together
in this hole.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.480
My goodness. What's the matter with you?

18:26.190 --> 18:29.610
I would like to know what you're
planning on doing about the Newman girls.

18:29.693 --> 18:30.777
They've been dealt with.

18:30.861 --> 18:33.405
I spoke to Austin.
He's going to take them in.

18:34.072 --> 18:36.116
-He is?
-Yes.

18:36.200 --> 18:40.954
You see, I am listening to you,
even though it might seem like I'm not.

18:41.038 --> 18:42.956
Well, I just need you to show it more.

18:43.874 --> 18:45.876
This is about the cattle show, isn't it?

18:47.669 --> 18:49.880
I'm going to make that up to you.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.965
It's been three weeks, Edward.

18:53.383 --> 18:54.426
I've been busy.

18:54.510 --> 18:57.054
Well, I'm tired of you being busy.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.474
Our children are all grown up now.

19:00.849 --> 19:03.143
This is the time
we're supposed to rediscover

19:03.227 --> 19:05.103
the passionate days of our youth.

19:05.646 --> 19:07.856
The days when it wasn't
just the cattle show.

19:09.107 --> 19:12.027
It was Christmas and Easter too.

19:16.490 --> 19:18.075
Do you remember how adventurous
we used to be?

19:19.743 --> 19:22.371
That time we conceived Lavinia
in the middle of the day?

19:24.540 --> 19:28.377
Or that time we put a new quilt on our bed
and we pretended that we were in a hotel?

19:30.003 --> 19:31.880
You looked beautiful on that quilt.

19:33.048 --> 19:34.716
But why don't we do that anymore?

19:38.971 --> 19:40.180
Well, what can I say?

19:43.183 --> 19:44.393
We got old.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.315
Wow.

19:50.816 --> 19:52.943
I don't remember
these hedgerows being so tall.

19:54.570 --> 19:55.737
Or so long.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.990
I think we might have gotten lost.

19:59.992 --> 20:02.953
Oh, good. Good. I was hoping we would.

20:03.453 --> 20:04.454
You were?

20:05.455 --> 20:07.457
Yeah. Getting lost is the whole point.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.418
Don't you like being lost?

20:10.043 --> 20:11.336
I don't know.

20:12.921 --> 20:15.382
Lost is how I feel now
when I sit down to write.

20:16.091 --> 20:18.802
All I see is a blank piece of paper
staring back at me.

20:19.803 --> 20:22.222
Well, that doesn't sound like being lost.

20:23.140 --> 20:27.102
That sounds like being all too aware of
yourself and the noisy world around you.

20:27.686 --> 20:31.648
I'm talking about being so focused
on something that you disappear into it.

20:32.191 --> 20:34.776
You lose track of time
and space, and people.

20:34.860 --> 20:37.738
It's just you and your flow.
Surely you've experienced that?

20:37.821 --> 20:38.906
I have.

20:43.785 --> 20:44.995
But I don't anymore.

20:45.621 --> 20:48.916
Then you need to get lost. Totally lost.

20:50.876 --> 20:52.794
Come on. Let's go deeper.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.386
Lola.

21:03.889 --> 21:05.015
Lola.

21:05.807 --> 21:08.018
Lola Montez.

21:08.894 --> 21:11.104
My name is Lavinia, but you...

21:12.022 --> 21:13.232
can call me Lola.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.067
Just call me Lola.

21:15.150 --> 21:18.362
I do a spider dance--

21:20.364 --> 21:21.365
No!

21:30.290 --> 21:31.959
Well, what do you think, babe?

21:32.042 --> 21:34.586
-You defaced my parents' property.
-I know.

21:35.420 --> 21:38.799
I forgot that a girl needs to feel
fully blindsided by a wild prank

21:38.882 --> 21:40.425
in order to commit to a marriage.

21:40.884 --> 21:42.803
I literally thought I was being kidnapped.

21:42.886 --> 21:44.012
So it worked.

21:44.388 --> 21:46.306
And now you can't possibly say no to me.

21:47.099 --> 21:49.059
Well, not in front of all these people.

21:49.601 --> 21:53.605
Say yes. Say yes.

21:54.064 --> 21:55.941
How did you even get them all to do this?

21:56.024 --> 21:57.484
I'm a businessman.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.279
-Okay. But I--
-Okay?

22:01.363 --> 22:02.364
Okay?

22:02.447 --> 22:03.991
Okay! She said okay!

22:06.743 --> 22:08.871
You're gonna make me
the happiest man alive.

22:11.373 --> 22:12.875
Jane, do you miss your husband?

22:12.958 --> 22:14.168
Abby.

22:17.754 --> 22:19.298
I guess we live here now.

22:20.966 --> 22:22.926
Anna. Clara.

22:23.594 --> 22:25.053
Welcome to the Evergreens.

22:25.554 --> 22:26.972
Let me take your bags.

22:28.682 --> 22:31.602
Are you hungry? What can I do
to make you feel comfortable?

22:32.102 --> 22:34.229
Anything you need, you just come to me.

22:35.898 --> 22:40.611
Cool uncle, cousin, stepdad, buddy.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.785
So, are we lost enough yet?

22:49.536 --> 22:52.039
I don't know.
Do you feel like you can write again?

23:01.590 --> 23:02.966
No.

23:03.050 --> 23:04.426
It's an editor.

23:04.927 --> 23:06.011
I gave my poem to him.

23:06.094 --> 23:08.931
And now it's like
he holds my life in his hands.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.266
Like I'm the daisy, and he's the sun,

23:11.350 --> 23:14.061
and without the warmth of his approval,
I can't grow.

23:24.196 --> 23:25.364
Well, that's not good.

23:27.449 --> 23:30.536
Opinion is a flitting thing.

23:32.204 --> 23:35.457
It's a hideous distraction
from the beauty of your craft.

23:36.250 --> 23:39.545
Okay. Then maybe I shouldn't
try to have an audience at all.

23:41.046 --> 23:42.256
Maybe fame is...

23:43.298 --> 23:44.299
dangerous.

23:47.469 --> 23:53.225
I mean, I gave one poem to one man
and now I have writer's block.

23:53.308 --> 23:55.435
The audience is irrelevant.

23:55.519 --> 23:58.814
The work itself is the gift,
not the praise for it.

24:00.315 --> 24:03.110
Understand that
and you'll understand true mastery.

24:03.193 --> 24:04.319
You're right.

24:06.321 --> 24:08.073
I know you're right, but how do I do it?

24:08.156 --> 24:09.241
It's simple.

24:10.158 --> 24:12.744
Refuse to be the daisy,
and start being the sun.

24:25.048 --> 24:26.258
Hey, you hear that?

24:28.093 --> 24:29.344
I'm not your daisy anymore.

24:37.936 --> 24:39.146
Mr. Olmsted?

25:47.923 --> 25:48.924
Hold steady.

25:49.007 --> 25:52.177
Okay. Up and out, woman.

25:52.261 --> 25:54.721
Stop yelling at me and hold steady.

25:54.805 --> 25:58.225
I can't see anything!
My head is stuck under your dress!

25:58.308 --> 25:59.893
Well, it's about time.

25:59.977 --> 26:01.103
What was that?

26:01.186 --> 26:02.187
-I'm almost there. Push.
-Okay.

26:02.271 --> 26:03.397
Give me one good push.

26:03.814 --> 26:04.815
Okay.

26:09.194 --> 26:10.445
Okay.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.031
Em.

26:13.532 --> 26:15.868
Right. Em. Now give me a hand.

26:22.833 --> 26:23.917
Where are you going?

26:24.001 --> 26:25.377
Good talk, Edward.

26:25.836 --> 26:27.004
Em!

26:29.381 --> 26:30.841
Where are you going?

26:41.810 --> 26:42.853
Hey!

26:43.812 --> 26:45.189
I am the sun.

26:46.398 --> 26:48.317
I am the sun.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.527
-I am the sun.
-Emily! There you are.

26:51.028 --> 26:52.905
Mr. Olmsted, is that you?

26:56.909 --> 26:58.285
Sam. My God.

26:59.036 --> 27:01.455
Emily. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

27:01.538 --> 27:02.789
You have?

27:04.666 --> 27:06.376
Sam. I was so scared.

27:07.085 --> 27:10.214
It's like my whole brain was taken over
by one thought,

27:10.297 --> 27:12.549
whether or not
you were going to like my poem.

27:15.135 --> 27:16.553
You don't have to be scared.

27:17.429 --> 27:18.847
I have great news for you.

27:19.389 --> 27:20.390
You do?

27:21.475 --> 27:22.726
I read your poem.

27:24.019 --> 27:25.145
And it's brilliant.

27:25.729 --> 27:26.939
It's incredible.

27:29.233 --> 27:30.651
And I'm going to publish it.

27:31.527 --> 27:33.153
I'm going to publish you.

27:34.488 --> 27:35.739
My little daisy.

27:43.121 --> 27:44.373
What's the matter?

27:47.501 --> 27:48.627
You should be smiling.

27:50.963 --> 27:51.964
I know.

27:53.632 --> 27:57.386
It's just I was so lost today.

28:00.097 --> 28:03.725
Well, you don't have to worry.

28:05.644 --> 28:08.647
When you're famous
and the whole world can see you,

28:10.649 --> 28:13.902
you will never be able
to get lost ever again.

28:20.826 --> 28:22.536
No, look.

28:30.627 --> 28:32.546
It's a good thing
Maggie has so many brothers

28:32.629 --> 28:34.506
or I never would've
gotten out of that hole.

28:34.590 --> 28:35.966
I'm sorry they came by so soon.

28:36.049 --> 28:38.635
You could've used
a few more hours in there, in my opinion.

28:40.262 --> 28:42.389
Oh, look. It's our better daughter.

28:42.472 --> 28:44.850
The beautiful and betrothed Lavinia.

28:46.935 --> 28:49.396
Are you guys
actually okay with me marrying Ship?

28:49.938 --> 28:53.025
He said you gave permission,
but I'm not sure that he's--

28:53.108 --> 28:56.320
We absolutely gave our permission.
We think he's a fine fellow.

28:57.070 --> 28:58.238
Don't we, Edward?

28:58.614 --> 28:59.740
He's all right.

29:01.116 --> 29:02.868
He's simply dashing, Vinnie.

29:02.951 --> 29:04.494
And that proposal. My goodness.

29:04.578 --> 29:05.913
It's so romantic.

29:06.371 --> 29:08.790
I wish someone
would've done something like that for me.

29:08.874 --> 29:10.626
I gave you a perfectly nice proposal.

29:10.709 --> 29:12.044
Yes, dear. You wrote me a letter

29:12.127 --> 29:15.255
analyzing the amount of butter
I would need per month, and then you said,

29:15.339 --> 29:18.592
"I suggest you and I might make
frugal and reasonable companions."

29:18.967 --> 29:21.720
See, people speak
different languages of love, Lavinia.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.515
I am so happy for you, Vinnie.

29:24.598 --> 29:25.724
I really am.

29:26.183 --> 29:29.061
And tomorrow morning we'll sort through
your handkerchiefs for your trousseau.

29:30.103 --> 29:32.064
I don't know if I wanna get married.

29:32.147 --> 29:34.775
Lavinia. I have had a very hard day.

29:34.858 --> 29:37.861
You are going to marry this man
and that's final. Good night.

29:42.366 --> 29:44.159
These children will be the death of me.
