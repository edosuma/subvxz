00:05.480 --> 00:09.360
<i>Th-This is Akihabara?</i>

00:12.460 --> 00:14.050
Are you frightened?

00:14.050 --> 00:15.080
Of course not.

00:15.400 --> 00:18.140
Coming here was your idea,

00:18.140 --> 00:20.000
so I suppose that is only natural.

00:21.260 --> 00:24.790
Princess, I must return to my guild for a time.

00:25.490 --> 00:27.800
They will accompany you until I return.

00:28.660 --> 00:30.800
We haven't introduced ourselves, have we?

00:31.380 --> 00:33.300
I am Shiroe, of Log Horizon.

00:33.640 --> 00:35.370
This is Akatsuki.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.830
P-Pleased to meet you.

00:39.300 --> 00:42.340
Um, so... Where do I start?

00:44.320 --> 00:48.060
For starters, here in the street 
is not the place. Shall we go?

02:21.880 --> 02:25.790
They left me in charge here, but there 
isn't anything interesting to do now.

02:25.790 --> 02:28.480
Both Shiroe and the princess are gone.

02:28.910 --> 02:32.540
And I was only a blacksmith to begin with...

02:33.050 --> 02:35.170
Now, what to do?

02:37.200 --> 02:40.660
Sir Soujirou, this custard is delicious.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.750
Thank you.

02:41.750 --> 02:45.170
Hey, no fair! Listen to me, too.

02:45.170 --> 02:46.060
Um...

02:46.340 --> 02:49.060
Sir Soujirou is tired.

02:49.060 --> 02:50.940
Then I'll sing him a lullaby.

02:50.940 --> 02:52.500
No, I will!

02:54.620 --> 02:57.880
This is part of the job. 
This is part of the job!

02:57.880 --> 02:59.200
All right, everyone...

02:59.560 --> 03:00.740
Let's all get along,

03:01.500 --> 03:02.200
okay?

03:02.470 --> 03:03.890
Yes!

03:03.890 --> 03:04.950
Yes...

03:05.450 --> 03:08.460
I'm not even sure I care anymore.

03:25.430 --> 03:27.350
Is that some kind of event?

03:27.350 --> 03:29.980
Maybe it's just cosplay?

03:30.690 --> 03:33.620
<i>You're walking a bit fast...</i>

03:34.130 --> 03:39.990
<b>Expeditionary Force</b>

03:37.920 --> 03:39.330
Expeditionary Force.

03:42.380 --> 03:44.540
We've been waiting, Shiroe...

03:44.540 --> 03:46.390
And Princess Lenessia.

03:46.390 --> 03:50.410
Hello, I am Karashin, the trader.

03:50.810 --> 03:53.310
I am Lenessia of the Cowen family.

03:53.660 --> 03:55.420
A pleasure to meet you.

03:55.790 --> 03:57.540
A real princess, huh?

03:58.270 --> 04:00.160
She's even more amazing than I'd heard.

04:03.670 --> 04:06.080
I think we need something with impact.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.030
The first impression should blow them away.

04:08.530 --> 04:09.960
Do you have Valkyrie mail?

04:09.960 --> 04:11.400
We have about seven types,

04:11.400 --> 04:15.190
between model variations and 
our own, original designs.

04:15.480 --> 04:18.840
And a good weapon would be nice, as well.

04:18.840 --> 04:20.360
One with a required level under 4.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.560
U-Um...

04:22.420 --> 04:24.500
Oh, wow! It's a real princess!

04:24.500 --> 04:25.610
She looked this way!

04:25.610 --> 04:27.370
She's so cute!

04:28.770 --> 04:30.450
She smiled!

04:30.850 --> 04:33.530
This is a one-handed weapon, 
with high attack power.

04:33.530 --> 04:36.210
I'd like something flashier, 
with priority on looks.

04:33.530 --> 04:36.210
Princess, are you hungry?

04:37.250 --> 04:39.180
Yes, I suppose...

04:39.180 --> 04:41.630
Then have this.

04:45.180 --> 04:48.320
You got these here with perfect timing.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.530
Shiroe asked me to bring them.

04:51.530 --> 04:54.910
Crescent Burgers are so good.

04:57.310 --> 04:58.930
She ate it!

04:58.930 --> 05:01.110
She eats like a princess.

05:01.110 --> 05:04.330
Do you like it? It's called a Crescent Burger.

05:04.700 --> 05:07.030
Yes, I've never had one before!

05:07.030 --> 05:07.920
It's so...

05:11.200 --> 05:13.200
Princess Lenessia, here.

05:14.610 --> 05:16.380
Akatsuki, help her get changed.

05:16.380 --> 05:17.350
Right.

05:17.350 --> 05:18.930
We'll help, too.

05:19.340 --> 05:22.520
Could you all help me with something else?

05:22.520 --> 05:23.380
Yes!

05:23.980 --> 05:25.760
I'll help you with your skirt.

05:26.280 --> 05:27.020
Eh?

05:31.580 --> 05:35.960
This armor emphasizes the lines 
of my body a bit too much...

05:35.960 --> 05:38.100
Actually, it makes them look 
better than normal.

05:37.330 --> 05:41.810
<b>Special Dressing Room 
Peek and Be Sent to the Cathedral</b>

05:38.100 --> 05:40.530
And it shows my entire legs!

05:40.530 --> 05:42.390
You're tall, so it has to.

05:42.390 --> 05:43.710
Deal with it.

05:44.660 --> 05:45.440
Right...

05:48.830 --> 05:51.330
Looks pretty good, Karashin.

05:51.330 --> 05:54.160
Yes, I think it's beautiful.

05:54.470 --> 05:56.980
Th-Thank you.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.810
A lot more people are in 
full gear all of a sudden.

06:04.810 --> 06:07.540
Yeah, are they handing out a quest?

06:14.290 --> 06:19.810
Thank you for coming so early 
in the morning, everyone.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.250
I am Shiroe, of Log Horizon.

06:23.500 --> 06:27.570
Our situation is pressing, 
so I'll get right to the point.

06:29.300 --> 06:32.080
An army of up to twenty thousand goblins

06:32.080 --> 06:34.290
has appeared in the northern Kanto hills.

06:34.760 --> 06:38.350
They threaten the League 
of Freedom Cities, Eastal.

06:39.340 --> 06:42.190
Even if we leave them alone, 
Eastal will not be wiped out,

06:42.750 --> 06:45.400
but they'll lose around thirty 
percent of their total forces.

06:46.610 --> 06:48.300
Thirty percent of their total forces?

06:48.300 --> 06:50.010
That's practically annihilated.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.530
Northern Kanto would mean...

06:51.530 --> 06:53.050
When did they show up?

06:53.050 --> 06:54.100
Show me that map.

06:55.390 --> 07:00.660
<i>All the people here understand tactics, 
and they can read maps.</i>

07:01.490 --> 07:04.110
<i>How are they all so intelligent?</i>

07:05.250 --> 07:09.290
<i>Are the adventurers here 
more than just soldiers?</i>

07:09.830 --> 07:11.670
<i>Does that mean they're smarter</i>

07:11.670 --> 07:14.620
<i>than our military officers or a court official?</i>

07:16.360 --> 07:18.120
<i>Then what is a noble?</i>

07:19.210 --> 07:20.370
<i>What is a commoner?</i>

07:20.370 --> 07:23.130
<i>What is a serf?</i>

07:23.790 --> 07:25.590
For our part,

07:25.590 --> 07:30.120
defending Akihabara from the goblins 
would not be terribly difficult.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.140
If all we care about is ourselves,

07:34.230 --> 07:36.890
there's no need to save Eastal.

07:39.930 --> 07:42.530
There's nothing we stand to gain by doing so.

07:42.960 --> 07:43.810
However,

07:44.530 --> 07:47.270
with this in mind, there's someone 
I'd like you to listen to.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.740
Let's go.

08:15.170 --> 08:17.010
<i>Th-This is...</i>

08:18.000 --> 08:19.260
<i>What do I do?</i>

08:39.200 --> 08:41.610
Everyone, it's nice to meet you.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.460
I am the granddaughter of Duke Cowen, 
one of the People of the Land,

08:46.460 --> 08:48.590
and leader of the Freedom Cities of Eastal....

08:48.590 --> 08:51.090
Lenessia El Arte Cowen.

08:51.860 --> 08:55.220
I am here today to make a request of you.

08:55.730 --> 09:01.220
As Shiroe has just explained, 
the land of Yamato is in peril.

09:01.780 --> 09:04.620
Our guardians, the Izumo Knights, have vanished,

09:05.150 --> 09:10.230
leaving Eastal to deal with the threat on its own.

09:10.770 --> 09:13.010
It shames me to say this,

09:13.010 --> 09:18.240
but even now, we haven't managed 
to decide on a course of action.

09:19.370 --> 09:20.660
And what's more...

09:21.630 --> 09:25.150
And what's more, we were planning to force you

09:25.150 --> 09:27.870
to take over our duty to protect our own cities.

09:29.410 --> 09:31.170
We were prepared

09:31.850 --> 09:36.420
to depend on you, the immortal 
adventurers, to protect our lands.

09:37.710 --> 09:38.850
I am

09:40.740 --> 09:42.980
terribly sorry...

09:45.190 --> 09:48.680
And the reason I am sorry is that I, myself,

09:48.680 --> 09:50.910
have come to make another selfish request.

09:52.130 --> 09:56.510
Neither I nor Eastal has much 
with which to pay you.

09:56.890 --> 09:59.300
I cannot even imagine

09:59.300 --> 10:02.200
what we could offer a town 
as prosperous as Akihabara.

10:03.140 --> 10:06.980
And there is no price we could name 
that's worthy of your freedom.

10:08.910 --> 10:10.130
But...

10:10.130 --> 10:12.700
As a daughter of the Cowen family,

10:12.700 --> 10:15.530
my duty is to protect the city of Maihama.

10:16.880 --> 10:21.740
I am cowardly, lazy, and little more 
than a decoration that cannot think...

10:25.240 --> 10:27.440
But I am going to fight!

10:32.720 --> 10:33.780
She's a goddess!

10:34.120 --> 10:35.870
She's so beautiful...

10:38.080 --> 10:40.650
So, if I may ask...

10:40.960 --> 10:44.620
If any of you would still be all right 
with that, would you please join me?

10:45.010 --> 10:49.620
Would you fight for me, in the name 
of your good will and freedom?

10:50.080 --> 10:54.160
I wish to protect the freedom of 
all adventurers as much as I can.

10:54.660 --> 10:55.680
Please...

10:56.480 --> 10:58.530
Please help me!

11:19.600 --> 11:20.720
Princess!

11:20.720 --> 11:22.730
I've been waiting for a big event like this!

11:22.730 --> 11:25.110
I've never seen a real princess before!

11:25.110 --> 11:28.110
I'm going with the princess!

11:28.110 --> 11:32.830
Princess! Princess! Princess!

11:33.840 --> 11:37.270
We will now set out for our 
first military expedition.

11:37.270 --> 11:42.340
This quest is from the Round Table, 
and it is for adventurers above level 40.

11:42.680 --> 11:45.380
If you wish to volunteer, come forward!

11:45.900 --> 11:48.730
I, Crusty, will lead the army.

11:51.140 --> 11:53.890
And I, Shiroe, will be our strategist.

11:54.410 --> 11:56.950
We will begin by forming a 
forward strike battalion.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.990
I will be contacting you within 
fifteen minutes via telepathy.

12:00.900 --> 12:01.990
That is all!

12:01.990 --> 12:03.290
Stand by until then.

12:03.290 --> 12:03.990
Dismissed!

12:05.890 --> 12:07.140
<i>I said it...</i>

12:07.650 --> 12:09.340
Why are you so flustered?

12:10.180 --> 12:12.600
Wh-What are you saying?

12:12.600 --> 12:16.880
A noble shouldn't speak that way. 
They shouldn't...

12:16.880 --> 12:18.710
I think you did well.

12:19.970 --> 12:21.220
What?

12:21.620 --> 12:23.580
Let's go, Princess.

12:39.630 --> 12:42.280
In this operation, our primary concern is speed.

12:42.570 --> 12:43.410
Why is that?

12:43.850 --> 12:47.280
We don't know what the 
goblins will do after this.

12:47.790 --> 12:50.220
After they eat all the food in the mountains,

12:50.220 --> 12:51.890
they might come to Akihabara.

12:51.890 --> 12:53.910
Then Akihabara would become a war zone?

12:53.910 --> 12:56.420
You're saying that's one possibility, right?

12:57.040 --> 12:59.790
As long as we don't know where 
they'll choose to fight,

12:59.790 --> 13:01.220
they have the advantage.

13:01.870 --> 13:03.550
So we need speed.

13:03.890 --> 13:07.890
Then we have adventurers leave 
as soon as they're ready?

13:07.890 --> 13:08.580
Yes.

13:09.020 --> 13:10.150
I see.

13:10.560 --> 13:28.560
<b>Prototype Steam Engine-Equipped Transport 
Ocypete</b>

13:11.060 --> 13:14.370
So that's why we're using this steamship?

13:14.370 --> 13:17.260
It still won't fulfill all our plans,

13:17.260 --> 13:20.570
but it can get our forces to 
Narashino Port quickly.

13:20.760 --> 13:23.180
Later, we can use it to ferry more.

13:23.810 --> 13:26.940
Crusty, I'll leave the Ocypete to you.

13:27.300 --> 13:28.000
Right.

13:28.740 --> 13:30.730
And what will you be doing?

13:30.730 --> 13:32.240
Well, I'll be...

13:33.020 --> 13:35.160
The Midraunt Equestrian Park?

13:35.160 --> 13:36.080
Yes.

13:36.430 --> 13:40.030
There are only wild animals nearby. 
No nasty monsters.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.200
It's the ideal place to set up a strategic HQ.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.240
How many people?

13:44.830 --> 13:46.300
Around twelve hundred.

13:46.300 --> 13:47.650
Twelve hundred?

13:47.650 --> 13:50.140
Wow, I'm amazed you got so many.

13:50.140 --> 13:52.850
The princess's recklessness paid off.

13:52.850 --> 13:54.120
I see.

13:54.520 --> 13:57.880
If we keep up this pace, 
we'll arrive this afternoon.

13:57.880 --> 14:02.310
Tonight, we'll make camp, and then set 
to organizing these twelve hundred.

14:03.020 --> 14:06.360
I'll continue to keep an eye on the nobles.

14:06.670 --> 14:08.880
Sorry to make you do all this.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.810
Not at all. Thank you.

14:12.580 --> 14:15.560
I really wanted to see the Ocypete leave port...

14:15.560 --> 14:16.780
Michitaka?

14:17.560 --> 14:18.810
You have a visitor.

14:19.220 --> 14:20.210
A visitor?

14:22.620 --> 14:27.760
My granddaughter's actions 
risk splitting the league.

14:28.230 --> 14:29.850
Are they concerned that the Cowen family

14:29.850 --> 14:33.760
might have been working secretly with 
the Round Table on a separate deal?

14:33.760 --> 14:34.640
Yes.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.140
But I'm sure the princess had no such designs.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.100
But that isn't how they see it.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.650
That's exactly what some of the lords are saying.

14:44.860 --> 14:45.940
I understand...

14:46.410 --> 14:52.160
Then they believe that Maihama may establish 
a new power with Akihabara at its side?

14:52.680 --> 14:54.780
That is a possibility, correct?

14:55.720 --> 14:59.170
What are your thoughts on the matter?

14:59.470 --> 15:01.070
What...

15:02.970 --> 15:06.420
First, we'd like to hear what you 
have in mind, Lord Sergiatte.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.840
Whether the Round Table can 
accept it is the question.

15:12.410 --> 15:14.030
That is quite true.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.690
It's strange for me to say this,

15:16.690 --> 15:19.340
but we'll never get anywhere if we keep 
questioning the other's intentions.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.780
I'd like to hear your best-case scenario.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.770
First, I'd like to exterminate the goblins.

15:27.070 --> 15:30.950
Protecting our lands is an absolute necessity.

15:31.310 --> 15:33.230
I can understand that.

15:33.510 --> 15:35.830
Then what would you like from us?

15:36.690 --> 15:42.330
I've abandoned the idea of having the Round 
Table join the League as nobility.

15:43.850 --> 15:49.440
I would like to apologize for 
offering you a noble title.

15:49.440 --> 15:50.900
It was very rude of me.

15:52.110 --> 15:56.900
I understand now that the 
Round Table and Akihabara

15:56.900 --> 16:01.580
are forces that rival Eastal in 
both strength and structure.

16:02.100 --> 16:07.860
It wouldn't have ever been possible 
to make you part of our alliance.

16:09.340 --> 16:11.570
So how do you feel we should proceed?

16:12.140 --> 16:17.760
I would think it best for both parties to make 
a nonaggression pact and a trade treaty,

16:17.760 --> 16:20.830
and to use that as the 
basis for further relations.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.840
If we can take each other's hand as 
neighbors, that would be a good start.

16:26.200 --> 16:30.520
But what will we do about the goblins?

16:30.520 --> 16:34.340
What are your thoughts about the 
inequality inherent to the defense?

16:34.880 --> 16:38.380
The inequality between adventurers 
and People of the Land?

16:45.360 --> 16:47.450
Well, I don't think we have 
to worry about that now.

16:47.450 --> 16:49.550
Without Crusty, Princess Lenessia,

16:49.550 --> 16:52.990
and Shiroe here, we can't really make a decision.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.680
No point in worrying about it now.

17:00.440 --> 17:03.750
I'm sure Shiroe can find a way to work this out.

17:05.500 --> 17:06.670
Very well.

17:06.670 --> 17:12.780
Then I'll just have my granddaughter 
take responsibility for this.

17:10.760 --> 17:16.760
<b>Cinderella Castle

17:32.960 --> 17:37.390
<i>I far exceeded my station by running into 
that conference and making a fuss.</i>

17:37.390 --> 17:40.740
<i>Then I humiliated my grandfather 
and the other lords, and ran away.</i>

17:41.580 --> 17:45.250
<i>And I gave a speech like that in 
these embarrassing clothes.</i>

17:46.010 --> 17:49.080
<i>I let the momentum take over 
and said such outrageous things.</i>

17:49.080 --> 17:50.640
<i>I regret it, but...</i>

17:51.490 --> 17:55.710
You look as though you're dying 
to take it back, but you can't.

17:55.710 --> 17:58.300
Th-That isn't true.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.750
You're stuttering.

18:01.590 --> 18:03.060
You look tired and miserable.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.380
But I don't regret it.

18:07.070 --> 18:09.930
I'm asking you to risk your lives,

18:09.930 --> 18:13.780
so naturally, I should accompany you 
and stand in battle beside you.

18:15.770 --> 18:17.970
Ever since I went to Akihabara,

18:18.450 --> 18:21.790
I've been feeling kind of down...

18:22.150 --> 18:22.980
Down?

18:23.570 --> 18:27.790
So many things are different 
from the world I know...

18:28.510 --> 18:32.290
I really was a bird in a cage, wasn't I?

18:33.800 --> 18:37.940
I was born a girl, so I have no political power.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.580
Even if I promise to protect 
the adventurers' freedom,

18:42.580 --> 18:44.270
I don't have the power to do so.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.100
But...

18:47.080 --> 18:51.340
Just as you were first to acknowledge 
my freedom to go to battle,

18:51.340 --> 18:53.980
I wish to protect their freedom!

18:55.580 --> 18:57.270
That is my desire.

19:01.010 --> 19:06.500
Of course, my life isn't so valuable 
as to make up for that...

19:09.580 --> 19:10.780
That's fine.

19:12.520 --> 19:13.600
It's more than—

19:13.600 --> 19:16.180
The formations are ready, my lord.

19:16.710 --> 19:17.760
All right.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.290
I'll see you later, then.

19:26.810 --> 19:30.340
Welcome back! I'm so glad you're safe!

19:30.650 --> 19:33.390
M-Marielle, I can't breathe!

19:33.390 --> 19:36.300
You all did well! I'm so impressed!

19:36.300 --> 19:37.570
Aww...

19:37.950 --> 19:39.530
Well, I suppose we did.

19:40.390 --> 19:42.030
Thank you.

19:42.460 --> 19:44.870
What? If you want, boast more.

19:44.870 --> 19:47.450
But it isn't over yet...

19:47.720 --> 19:51.030
I suppose we can say we've 
made it through wave one.

19:51.420 --> 19:54.310
The town of Choushi wasn't hurt.

19:54.310 --> 19:57.010
The camp leaders did a good job,

19:57.010 --> 19:59.940
but it was the new players 
who really worked hard.

20:00.320 --> 20:04.800
I wasn't sure how I'd persuade them, 
but it turned out I didn't need to.

20:05.350 --> 20:08.860
They volunteered to fight on their own.

20:08.860 --> 20:09.980
I get it...

20:10.640 --> 20:11.810
To be honest,

20:12.670 --> 20:15.040
I was shocked to learn

20:15.040 --> 20:20.070
that the People of the Land have 
emotions and thoughts like we do.

20:20.450 --> 20:22.970
Of course, so was I.

20:22.970 --> 20:25.180
But Shiro said it first...

20:25.470 --> 20:27.290
That they're human, too.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.690
That we're the ones who are different.

20:30.510 --> 20:33.230
NPCs, events, flags...

20:33.900 --> 20:37.960
The more games you've played, 
the harder it is to accept.

20:38.540 --> 20:42.380
But these kids never really knew the old game.

20:42.380 --> 20:44.970
They can look at the People of 
the Land as fellow humans.

20:46.290 --> 20:47.260
Yeah.

20:47.700 --> 20:48.720
Okay!

20:49.130 --> 20:51.460
Everyone, we're almost done.

20:51.460 --> 20:54.310
Let's all protect the town of Choushi!

20:54.310 --> 20:57.480
I know you can do it!

20:57.770 --> 20:59.050
Yeah!

21:00.660 --> 21:02.340
Okay, let's do this!

21:02.340 --> 21:03.450
I'll do my best.

21:03.450 --> 21:05.100
Leave it to me.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.210
This is what it means to be an adventurer!

21:09.270 --> 21:10.250
Rudy...

21:14.000 --> 21:16.690
Then, I will announce the formations!

21:16.690 --> 21:17.680
Right!

21:18.740 --> 21:20.350
We'll fight in legion raids.

21:20.350 --> 21:24.720
Four groups of twenty-four members,

21:24.720 --> 21:27.210
so ninety-six in all.

21:27.890 --> 21:29.870
Ninety-six?

21:30.330 --> 21:33.890
It's difficult for this many people 
to fight as a single group,

21:33.890 --> 21:36.520
and it's impossible to understand 
the state of the overall battle.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.120
You need a lot of experience to command them.

21:41.080 --> 21:46.480
But in that respect, my lord is the best there is.

21:46.850 --> 21:48.200
In Yamato,

21:48.200 --> 21:51.790
he's one of fewer than twenty people 
to have commanded an entire army.

21:52.210 --> 21:55.470
His experience, instincts, 
and powers of concentration

21:55.470 --> 21:58.960
all make him the ultimate commander.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.330
I see...

22:00.850 --> 22:01.800
One further thing.

22:03.110 --> 22:05.450
I am giving you a guard of twelve.

22:05.800 --> 22:09.700
Please refrain from doing anything foolish.

22:10.130 --> 22:11.350
Understood?

22:11.740 --> 22:13.330
Y-Yes.

22:14.010 --> 22:15.850
We'll disembark at the abandoned Narashino Port.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.310
We'll head for the west side of Kasumi Lake.

22:18.740 --> 22:20.470
It's twenty-four kilometers away.

22:21.380 --> 22:22.810
We move straight north.

22:23.290 --> 22:24.900
And as for the invading goblins...

22:26.940 --> 22:28.450
Kill them all.

24:05.590 --> 24:08.340
There was a young person 
who wanted to change.

24:08.340 --> 24:09.720
They thought and thought,

24:09.720 --> 24:12.100
then fought as hard as their 
soul and life would allow.

24:12.360 --> 24:13.600
They wanted to protect someone.

24:14.060 --> 24:16.810
All they wanted was to be 
able to protect someone.

24:17.360 --> 24:20.640
Even if that meant sacrificing their life.

24:21.020 --> 24:30.030
<b>Chasing After Them</b>

24:21.210 --> 24:23.730
Next time: Chasing After Them.

24:24.300 --> 24:26.960
Always look thirty seconds ahead.
