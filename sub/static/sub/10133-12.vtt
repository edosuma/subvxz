16:42.376 --> 16:45.087
Now get a lollipop.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.423
This is all very cute.

16:47.465 --> 16:50.802
Now, can we get on

16:47.465 --> 16:50.802
with the operation?

16:52.720 --> 16:55.139
What are you doing in here,

16:52.720 --> 16:55.139
looking for dessert?

16:55.181 --> 16:57.350
Out, out, out!

16:57.391 --> 17:00.770
She needs a nap.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.689
Dad, tell Comet

17:00.812 --> 17:02.689
to stay out of my room.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.732
Comet, stay out of her room.

17:04.774 --> 17:08.068
Your best friend's

17:04.774 --> 17:08.068
a hockey puck.

17:08.110 --> 17:11.739
Woo-hoo, problems everywhere.

17:08.110 --> 17:11.739
I live for this stuff.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.784
Okay, Jess, spill your guts.

17:14.826 --> 17:17.787
Joey agreed not to pitch his

17:14.826 --> 17:17.787
dumb idea, and he did it anyway.

17:17.829 --> 17:21.165
He stabbed me right in the back

17:17.829 --> 17:21.165
right in front of my face.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.167
Just like Comet.

17:23.209 --> 17:27.296
Alright, I think I want

17:23.209 --> 17:27.296
everybody to sit down right now.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.298
It's time for a little

17:27.338 --> 17:29.298
father-daughter

17:29.340 --> 17:31.759
brother-in-law talk.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.387
- Joey needs the talk.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.387
- So does Comet.

17:34.428 --> 17:37.097
I think the two of you should

17:34.428 --> 17:37.097
try putting yourselves

17:37.139 --> 17:39.017
in the other person's shoes.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.518
Or paws.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.189
This is very simple.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.733
Friends deserve

17:45.231 --> 17:46.733
a fair hearing

17:46.774 --> 17:49.151
and valuables should

17:46.774 --> 17:49.151
always be kept out of reach.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.530
So, Stephanie, next

17:49.193 --> 17:52.530
time Comet has an idea

17:52.572 --> 17:54.156
you have to hear him out.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.950
And, Jessy, if you just

17:54.198 --> 17:55.950
leave your advertising

17:55.992 --> 17:57.869
laying around the house

17:55.992 --> 17:57.869
there's a good chance

17:57.911 --> 18:00.079
Joey's gonna chew it up.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.081
You guys understand?

18:04.208 --> 18:06.085
I'm sorry,

18:04.208 --> 18:06.085
I'm a little confused.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.295
This is my first double lecture.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.340
Mr. Bear is all better.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.930
Mr. Bear. You're okay!

18:16.971 --> 18:21.100
He was very brave.

18:16.971 --> 18:21.100
The smile never left his face.

18:21.141 --> 18:24.938
Deej, you saved his life.

18:21.141 --> 18:24.938
You're the best big sister ever.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.817
Hey, what about me?

18:31.151 --> 18:33.821
You were a very good nurse.

18:35.406 --> 18:38.158
I give myself a lollipop.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.663
I'm gonna go find Comet

18:39.660 --> 18:42.663
and tell him I forgive him.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.665
Then I'm gonna teach

18:42.705 --> 18:44.665
him the difference between

18:44.707 --> 18:46.876
food and friends.

18:48.795 --> 18:52.172
Come on, Michelle,

18:48.795 --> 18:52.172
let's go write up her bill.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.259
- See how nice that worked out?

18:53.591 --> 18:55.259
- Yeah.

18:55.301 --> 18:58.471
Now if we could only

18:55.301 --> 18:58.471
stuff Joey, I'd be happy.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.516
I can't believe

18:59.680 --> 19:02.516
that he said I'm bossy.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.894
Danny, am I bossy?

19:04.936 --> 19:07.647
Well, Jess, you do

19:04.936 --> 19:07.647
like to get your own way.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.356
- What you saying?

19:07.688 --> 19:09.356
- You're bossy.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.025
Get out.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.611
I'm sorry. Don't..

19:13.653 --> 19:16.280
I guess I am a little bossy,

19:13.653 --> 19:16.280
I don't know.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.490
Alright, that's it.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.617
From now on,

19:17.531 --> 19:19.617
I'm not gonna be bossy.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.495
Look at this,

19:19.659 --> 19:22.495
I'm bossing myself around.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.580
What do I do?

19:24.622 --> 19:27.875
Jess, let me tell

19:24.622 --> 19:27.875
you a little story

19:27.917 --> 19:30.461
about a headstrong

19:27.917 --> 19:30.461
young boy named Danny.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.838
He was bright as a new penny--

19:31.879 --> 19:34.465
I'll figure this

19:31.879 --> 19:34.465
one out by myself.

19:44.725 --> 19:48.062
Joey, can I see you

19:44.725 --> 19:48.062
upstairs, please?

19:48.104 --> 19:50.314
I didn't hear you knock.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.441
You don't have a door.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.904
Come upstairs, please.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.114
Forget it, Jess.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.490
I'm not comin' upstairs

19:59.532 --> 20:02.076
just 'cause you

19:59.532 --> 20:02.076
asked me to come upstairs.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.831
Alright, look you,

20:04.453 --> 20:06.831
I came upstairs to tell you

20:06.873 --> 20:10.168
that you can't tell me

20:06.873 --> 20:10.168
to come upstairs.

20:13.171 --> 20:16.340
Joey, I'm sorry for being bossy,

20:13.171 --> 20:16.340
and I want you to forgive me.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.718

20:16.382 --> 20:18.718
Because you want

20:16.382 --> 20:18.718
me to forgive you

20:18.759 --> 20:20.594
I should just forgive you, huh?

20:20.636 --> 20:22.555
Yeah, well, dream on.

it's a good idea!

20:51.042 --> 20:52.877
Well, Jesse called

20:51.042 --> 20:52.877
me and apologized

20:52.919 --> 20:55.963
and he asked me to come over

20:52.919 --> 20:55.963
