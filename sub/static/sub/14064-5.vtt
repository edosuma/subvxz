00:07.532 --> 00:10.936
Denise, what is this?
The Pitino matter is set for trial?

00:11.035 --> 00:14.405
- Tomorrow.
- Didn't I tell you to get rid of this case two years ago?

00:14.505 --> 00:18.842
Three, actually. I'm meeting with
opposing counsel at 1 O:OO. I'll settle it.

00:18.942 --> 00:22.438
- Paul, problem.
- What's this?

00:22.545 --> 00:25.039
Lori Colson's filed
an internal complaint against us.

00:25.148 --> 00:27.413
- A complaint about what?
- Sexual harassment.

00:27.517 --> 00:30.044
- More specifically, Denny.
- Heard my name.

00:30.152 --> 00:32.714
Denny, Paul and I
need to talk to you.

00:32.821 --> 00:34.723
Whatever it is, I'm innocent.

00:34.823 --> 00:36.884
Yes. Paul's office at 11:OO, please.

00:36.992 --> 00:39.792
In the meantime, could you
please reposition your hand?

00:39.894 --> 00:42.262
Catherine, so nice
to see you at large.

00:42.362 --> 00:45.391
Well, that's so sweet of you.

00:45.499 --> 00:48.801
It would warm the cockles of my heart-

00:48.902 --> 00:50.871
if had a cockle, of course.

00:50.970 --> 00:53.908
There's a rumor that you’ve got one.

00:55.674 --> 00:57.905
How do I put this?

00:59.443 --> 01:02.382
You're fired.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.779
- What?
- I'm terribly sorry.

01:04.882 --> 01:07.411
But why?

01:07.519 --> 01:11.252
However willing we are
to relax the rules around here...

01:11.354 --> 01:15.887
we simply cannot have
administrative staff killing clients.

01:15.993 --> 01:19.431
- Does Alan know about this?
- I t is not Alan's decision.

01:19.528 --> 01:21.930
You can’t just fire me!

01:22.030 --> 01:23.761
I just did.

01:23.865 --> 01:26.836
Please be gone
by the end of business.

01:28.169 --> 01:31.232
Once again, I'm- I'm terribly sorry.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:42.514 --> 01:44.450
Are you finished?

01:46.452 --> 01:50.756
I'm sorry. I was reminded of girl
I favored when I was young.

01:50.856 --> 01:53.691
I'm Alan Shore.
If you’ve paid any attention...

01:53.791 --> 01:56.421
to office gossip,
you're right to avoid me.

01:56.526 --> 01:59.019
I'm just trying to save you
from wasting your time.

02:01.497 --> 02:04.992
Would you have dinner
with me tonight?

02:05.102 --> 02:07.503
All I'm looking for
is to have dinner...

02:07.602 --> 02:12.374
with a beautiful
yet anonymous woman...

02:12.474 --> 02:15.036
see myself through her eyes
and pretend I'm interesting.

02:15.142 --> 02:17.271
Alan!

02:18.312 --> 02:20.178
I've been Schmidt-canned.

02:54.109 --> 02:57.571
225, OOO?
Are you serious?

02:57.679 --> 03:00.845
You can run the numbers.
Covers all damaged caused by the fire...

03:00.948 --> 03:03.545
to both the garage and house,
which insurance already paid by the way.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.553
A woman died here.

03:05.653 --> 03:08.089
A terminal woman with less
than five days to live perhaps.

03:08.188 --> 03:12.356
- Certainly the cost of trial would exceed $225, OOO.
- Perhaps.

03:12.459 --> 03:15.920
But the cost of settlement could be exponentially
bigger if it occasions others to sue.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.397
- The risk of losing by verdict?
- That won't happen.

03:20.299 --> 03:23.964
You think I'm not ready to tee this
tomorrow? Is that what you think?

03:24.069 --> 03:27.006
Denise, you're no doubt a good lawyer
with a very diverse practice.

03:27.105 --> 03:29.905
You handle stock fraud, antitrust,
even some criminal work.

03:30.009 --> 03:33.538
The three of us do nothing
but defense work for car manufacturers.

03:33.644 --> 03:36.615
In fact, over the last few years
while you’ve been doing other things...

03:36.712 --> 03:38.683
letting this particular file
collect dust...

03:38.782 --> 03:42.276
we've been handling only
automobile product liability cases.

03:42.384 --> 03:46.290
Specializing, in fact,
in the sport trucks that catch fire...

03:46.388 --> 03:48.916
day after day after day.

03:49.025 --> 03:51.495
It's what we do.

03:55.897 --> 03:59.232
Your offer of225...

03:59.332 --> 04:01.199
is rejected.

04:01.301 --> 04:04.432
We shall see you then
for opening statements.

04:23.754 --> 04:26.418
- Who's dead?
- Nobody's dead, Denny.

04:26.523 --> 04:28.619
But we have a situation.

04:28.725 --> 04:33.427
Lori Colson filed an internal complaint
against you for sexual harassment.

04:33.528 --> 04:36.055
Lori Colson?
Did I sleep with her?

04:36.164 --> 04:41.733
The complaint goes to a hostile work
environment which she believes you foster.

04:41.836 --> 04:46.778
By law, we are required to start certain procedures
which involve you being questioned.

04:46.874 --> 04:51.815
We are concerned that your responses,
rather than making things better, might-

04:51.912 --> 04:54.508
Dig a hole to China.

04:54.614 --> 04:58.075
It would be best to avoid
an investigation altogether.

04:58.184 --> 05:00.849
In order for that to happen,
Lori has to withdraw her complaint.

05:00.953 --> 05:04.082
And for that to happen,
you need to apologize to her.

05:04.188 --> 05:05.920
What did I do?

05:06.024 --> 05:09.793
Last week you talked about
whether Judge Brown was a virgin.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.922
You made comments
about Lori's sex life.

05:13.030 --> 05:16.970
As far as she is concerned,
you broke the camel's back.

05:19.102 --> 05:23.475
First off. I haven't had sex with a camel
since I was in the army.

05:23.572 --> 05:25.474
And the camel
never complained by the way.

05:25.574 --> 05:29.536
As for Lori, I should be the one making
the complaint. She's constantly ogling me.

05:29.643 --> 05:33.048
Yes, putting reality aside...

05:33.148 --> 05:36.587
if you do not apologize to her,
this is a mess-

05:36.683 --> 05:39.483
for the firm, for you.

06:01.239 --> 06:03.141
- Alan.
- Can you tell me, Shirley...

06:03.241 --> 06:07.010
what possibly occasioned you to go
behind my back and fire my assistant?

06:07.110 --> 06:11.676
She needed to be fired.
I decided to spare you the dirty work.

06:11.781 --> 06:15.150
Alan, she went to the police
to turn in a client...

06:15.250 --> 06:17.414
who she subsequently murdered.

06:17.519 --> 06:20.580
If we’re to maintain any integrity
as a law firm-

06:20.689 --> 06:23.320
Why is that so important to everybody-
maintaining integrity?

06:23.424 --> 06:27.455
- Alan! - You could've at least
told me first before summarily-

06:27.561 --> 06:29.530
It would have made you complicit.

06:29.629 --> 06:34.935
This way she can hate me in perpetuity
while continuing to cherish you.

06:35.034 --> 06:37.869
Don't be surprised if one day
I go behind your back, Shirley.

06:37.969 --> 06:40.337
You'll be sure
to send me flowers first.

06:40.438 --> 06:42.499
225? That's all?

06:42.606 --> 06:45.544
I'm sorry.
I thought I'd be able to move them.

06:45.643 --> 06:47.943
You tell them to forget it.

06:48.045 --> 06:50.914
Jose, you were already compensated
for damages to the house.

06:51.014 --> 06:53.246
The fire killed my wife.

06:56.018 --> 07:00.551
It probably only robbed her oaf week.

07:00.656 --> 07:04.686
They have experts who will testy_
that since she died in her sleep...

07:04.793 --> 07:06.888
the smoke inhalation...

07:06.995 --> 07:10.866
may have actually spared her
pain and suffering.

07:15.869 --> 07:19.468
- Tell me what you’re thinking.
- I'm angry.

07:19.573 --> 07:23.603
For the last three years
I call to ask, "How is the case going?"

07:23.709 --> 07:27.945
I can never even get you on the phone.
I get some assistant saying, "It's progressing. "

07:28.047 --> 07:29.948
Nothing's been done.

07:30.048 --> 07:32.986
The case was fully developed
and ready to go to trial three years ago.

07:33.084 --> 07:38.220
There wasn't much to do other than push
for a trial date and pursue a settlement.

07:38.323 --> 07:40.315
When you took this case, you cared.

07:40.424 --> 07:44.226
You no longer care and I'm angry.

07:46.462 --> 07:51.266
I assure you, Jose, I still care.

07:52.403 --> 07:54.633
I don't want to settle for 225.

07:55.971 --> 07:58.373
Then we won't settle.

08:02.343 --> 08:08.083
Lori, Shirley and Paul have brought
to my attention...

08:08.181 --> 08:10.618
your discomfort with my banter.

08:10.717 --> 08:13.655
It's crossed the line of banter, Denny.

08:15.188 --> 08:18.489
Oh. Well-

08:18.590 --> 08:21.755
As I get older, I probably tend to be
more boastful about sex...

08:21.859 --> 08:23.761
because, well...

08:23.861 --> 08:27.129
I don't perform, uh-

08:28.598 --> 08:31.160
How you learned about me
and the camel I have no idea.

08:31.268 --> 08:33.703
But the truth is...

08:33.803 --> 08:36.172
I'm an insecure man sexually.

08:36.273 --> 08:40.212
Now, can we speak about you?

08:40.308 --> 08:43.075
- Okay.
- I've often found that...

08:43.178 --> 08:46.344
it's the chubby girls
who offend most easily.

08:46.448 --> 08:48.715
I don't know why it is.
I'm not a psychiatrist.

08:48.817 --> 08:51.117
For what it's worth, I like chubby girls.
I enjoy chubby sex.

08:51.219 --> 08:56.251
What I'm trying to say is if this
is a lonely curette’s cy for help...

08:56.356 --> 08:59.156
I'm here for you, Lori.

08:59.258 --> 09:01.855
So, we good?

09:04.330 --> 09:07.496
- Garrett, free this evening?
- What have you got in mind?

09:07.598 --> 09:09.535
Document production,
product design records.

09:09.634 --> 09:12.104
We've been through them once,
but you never know.

09:12.204 --> 09:14.936
Review the case file. I'll tell you
everything you need to look for.

09:15.039 --> 09:19.343
Then you need to go across town
to McKinley Fields, the defendant's law firm.

09:19.443 --> 09:21.344
Super.

09:31.053 --> 09:34.822
- Sara, I see you’re a lover offline wine.
- Not really.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.688
I just picked the most expensive.

09:36.792 --> 09:40.925
I figured whatever it is you have
in mind here, you should pay for it.

09:41.028 --> 09:44.694
When I pay for it,
it's usually cheap and tawdry.

09:44.798 --> 09:47.793
- All set to hear about our specials?
- Please!

09:47.901 --> 09:49.928
First, which I really recommend-
it's great-

09:50.035 --> 09:53.098
we have an incredible
North Atlantic salmon.

09:53.205 --> 09:55.937
It's farm raised. Just got it in today.
The chef prepared-

09:56.040 --> 10:00.846
Now would these be the Atlantic salmon
raised in pens in the Pacific Ocean?

10:00.945 --> 10:02.414
The ones who periodically escape.

10:02.515 --> 10:04.917
I can assure you the ones
we're serving didn't escape.

10:06.884 --> 10:11.290
That's very funny. Tell me,
do people here order the farmed salmon?

10:11.387 --> 10:13.620
It's actually our most
popular dish tonight.

10:15.259 --> 10:17.422
I see.

10:18.494 --> 10:20.259
Good evening, diners.
Forgive me.

10:20.363 --> 10:25.703
But instead of grace, I typically begin
my meals with a public service announcement.

10:25.799 --> 10:28.429
I just thought you’d like to know...

10:28.537 --> 10:31.804
by ordering
or buying farmed salmon...

10:31.906 --> 10:34.570
you may be helping
to wipe out the wild-

10:34.674 --> 10:37.270
- or rather, real- salmon stocks.
- Sir.

10:37.377 --> 10:39.609
- That's not true.
- You're upsetting the patrons.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.977
Perhaps I should be
more entertaining then.

11:01.865 --> 11:03.834
We need to pool our resources
and stop the fish farms.

11:03.933 --> 11:07.269
I t doesn't even taste
like real salmon because it's not...

11:09.704 --> 11:11.766
caught.

11:13.274 --> 11:18.443
Which... fish should be.

11:38.463 --> 11:40.956
How do we not go over my testimony?

11:41.065 --> 11:45.233
If we rehearse, Jose, there's a chance that
your testimony will come off as rehearsed.

11:45.336 --> 11:49.937
- But shouldn't I have some idea
of what you plan to ask or- - No.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.944
Our case- pretty much our whole case-
is your emotion.

11:54.042 --> 11:56.879
I want your testimony
to be as raw as possible.

11:56.980 --> 11:59.610
So go home, watch a movie...

11:59.715 --> 12:02.687
don't think about things, and I'll see you
tomorrow at the courthouse.

12:02.784 --> 12:04.776
Okay.

12:10.724 --> 12:12.854
Everything okay?

12:16.128 --> 12:20.502
Six years ago, Denny, you threw me
a tiny little case to cut my teeth on.

12:20.600 --> 12:24.164
Since then, I have moved on to much bigger
and more lucrative matters.

12:24.269 --> 12:29.643
Well, that tiny little case that I have
neglected comes up for trial tomorrow.

12:30.975 --> 12:33.878
- I just hope I'm ready.
- Hmm.

12:33.977 --> 12:36.004
Hug?

12:42.885 --> 12:46.619
Boxes, photocopier,
knock yourself out.

12:46.721 --> 12:48.850
Thanks.

12:56.598 --> 12:59.000
I monitor to make sure
you don't steal originals.

12:59.099 --> 13:02.537
- They assigned you to sit in here and watch me?
- No, I volunteer.

13:02.635 --> 13:04.697
Why go out with friends
when I can sit...

13:04.804 --> 13:07.707
and observe first-year associates
do tedious grunt work?

13:07.806 --> 13:09.707
Are you a lawyer here?

13:09.808 --> 13:12.005
If I was a lawyer,
you think I'd be doing this?

13:12.110 --> 13:16.210
I'm a paralegal.
Even lower than you on the grunt meter.

13:16.314 --> 13:20.515
- You got a name?
- Yep.

13:26.457 --> 13:29.258
I hope as you viewed yourself
through my beautiful yet anonymous eyes...

13:29.360 --> 13:32.524
that you saw what everybody else in the
restaurant saw, which was a total nut job.

13:32.628 --> 13:38.401
- What's going on?
- He broke into a song from The Music Man _g_ _\sh.

13:38.499 --> 13:40.935
While you're here, there are six associates
in the conference room...

13:41.034 --> 13:43.096
helping Denise prep for her trial.

13:43.204 --> 13:46.107
- Go make it seven.
- Now? It's after 1 O:OO.

13:46.206 --> 13:48.733
You can tell time. That's great.
You're going to be reviewing arguments...

13:48.843 --> 13:51.243
given by opposing counsel
over the last 1 O years.

13:51.345 --> 13:56.251
Look for his pet phrases, folksy stories,
anecdotes, whatever he used to charm juries.

13:56.347 --> 13:59.650
Now we're a team here. Whatever Denise needs.
Thanks for coming back in.

13:59.751 --> 14:02.119
You're a trouper.

14:04.356 --> 14:06.551
I'm a trouper?

14:08.992 --> 14:13.592
- Wouldn't suppose I could get a beer around here?
- Nope.

14:15.898 --> 14:19.804
Maybe since we've hit it offs well,
you and I can get one together after I'm done?

14:19.902 --> 14:21.963
I don't date.

14:22.071 --> 14:25.737
- You don't date? You have a boyfriend?
- Nope.

14:25.841 --> 14:29.006
May I ask, don’t you get lonely?

14:31.811 --> 14:36.081
I don't date because all that ever comes obit
is that I get to know the guy...

14:36.182 --> 14:40.089
maybe even like the guy,
only then to be disappointed in bed.

14:41.522 --> 14:43.616
So I no longer bother.

14:43.723 --> 14:45.852
Huh.

14:45.958 --> 14:49.761
Well, if the bed part is important,
don’t you miss that?

14:49.861 --> 14:51.592
Oh, I screw.

14:51.697 --> 14:53.826
I just don't date.

14:53.931 --> 14:57.494
Okay, did they tell you to say that
to distract me from the files?

14:57.603 --> 15:00.973
- Take off your pants.
- What?

15:02.939 --> 15:05.342
Well, obviously you want to have sex.

15:05.443 --> 15:08.209
I want to see you first.

15:08.311 --> 15:10.838
I'm not going to let you inspect me.

15:10.946 --> 15:13.382
Fine.

15:16.485 --> 15:18.853
Okay.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.895
Did you have intentions
with this girl?

15:27.994 --> 15:32.833
I really didn't. I just wanted to have
a nice dinner with polite conversation.

15:32.931 --> 15:37.839
The kind of thing Tara accused me
of being utterly incapable of.

15:37.936 --> 15:39.837
Here's a tip, my friend.

15:39.937 --> 15:44.311
Never ever talk about anything
to do with the environment.

15:44.409 --> 15:46.971
It's boring.
It makes you boring.

15:47.077 --> 15:52.110
Second, it's political. You got to figure
half the people are against you.

15:52.216 --> 15:56.781
- Half the people are against the environment?
- And third-

15:56.885 --> 15:59.379
When you go out
with a young girl like Sara...

15:59.489 --> 16:02.517
you have only one thing
to offer- money.

16:02.624 --> 16:05.721
She can find younger,
better looking guys...

16:05.828 --> 16:08.765
better lovers, guys with more
interests in common.

16:08.864 --> 16:11.528
What you have is power.

16:11.633 --> 16:16.164
I actually begin my dates
by putting cash right on the table.

16:16.269 --> 16:19.503
- And that works?
- With the hookers.

16:19.606 --> 16:22.669
Sort interrupt.
I just have one quick little question.

16:22.776 --> 16:27.046
Did you tell Lori
you liked chubby sex?

16:29.648 --> 16:32.016
I meant it as a compliment.

16:39.490 --> 16:41.391
What?

17:00.941 --> 17:03.935
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God!

17:08.715 --> 17:12.816
first offal, nobody
disputes that a terrible tragedy has occurred.

17:12.919 --> 17:15.719
And if ever,
during the course of this trial...

17:15.821 --> 17:19.818
we come across as tying to trivialize
the plaintiffs pain...

17:19.924 --> 17:21.984
let me apologize for that right now.

17:22.093 --> 17:26.829
Their suffering is a given. And we all wish
we could bring Kevin Parkinson back.

17:26.931 --> 17:30.529
But lawsuits unfortunately
do not do that.

17:30.635 --> 17:33.299
Lawsuits are about money.

17:33.403 --> 17:36.967
Okay, that's his theme in
every single opening statement.

17:37.072 --> 17:41.479
He sets them up to detach themselves
from their emotions and he's very good at it.

17:41.577 --> 17:43.479
Where'd you get this tape?

17:43.579 --> 17:46.983
He had a trial in March. They allowed
cameras in the courtroom. Watch this.

17:47.080 --> 17:50.919
You're human beings. You don't have
to deny your feelings or compassion.

17:51.019 --> 17:55.754
Just don't let yourselves
adjurors be governed by them.

18:19.777 --> 18:23.945
Listen, I pored over most of the design records.
I didn't find anything new.

18:24.047 --> 18:26.813
Okay, thank you.

18:28.317 --> 18:31.413
Was there something else?

18:31.521 --> 18:37.191
Well, there was an incident which one of
the senior partners is calling Lewiston about.

18:37.291 --> 18:39.523
I felt I should report it to you.

18:49.469 --> 18:52.406
You had sex tonight
with one of their paralegals?

18:52.504 --> 18:54.407
Yes.

18:55.808 --> 18:57.802
It had no bearing
on the quality formwork.

18:57.910 --> 18:59.903
And of course,
I didn't reveal anything privileged.

19:00.011 --> 19:04.075
- You had sex with her where?
- Um, in the file room.

19:04.181 --> 19:07.245
Where do you think you are, Garrett?

19:07.352 --> 19:09.513
- Do you think you’re still in college?
- No, ma'am.

19:09.618 --> 19:11.714
Call me "ma'am" again
and you are fired.

19:11.822 --> 19:15.819
Get out! I do not have time
to deal with this.

19:15.926 --> 19:17.895
Oh, not that this is relevant...

19:17.994 --> 19:22.561
but while I may have casual sex
outside of relationship...

19:22.665 --> 19:25.659
when I'm involved with someone,
I'm a completely faithful person.

19:25.768 --> 19:28.705
Garrett, get out.

19:35.376 --> 19:37.537
Look, I actually like Denny.

19:37.644 --> 19:40.672
And the truth is I can
tolerate most of his nonsense.

19:40.780 --> 19:45.243
But whereas five years ago
it was flirtatious, now it's lascivious.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.717
And with Alan Shore
suddenly at his side-

19:47.818 --> 19:49.880
What's this got to do
with Alan Shore?

19:49.988 --> 19:53.757
Alan Shore sexually objectifies
everywoman he meets.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.352
And I mean everywoman.

19:57.994 --> 20:01.593
At least with him, you can say
he's an equal opportunity offender.

20:01.698 --> 20:04.932
But you haven't filed
a complaint against Alan Shore?

20:05.035 --> 20:09.305
You know, I probably should.
But I don't want to give him the satisfaction.

20:09.405 --> 20:14.312
More importantly, he's not
the senior partner. Denny Crane is.

20:14.409 --> 20:17.040
By the way,
after I complained...

20:17.144 --> 20:20.207
Denny Crane attributed my protest...

20:20.313 --> 20:22.579
to the wanton cy
oaf lonely curette.

20:29.321 --> 20:32.781
Doctor, if you say
that she died peacefully in her sleep-

20:32.892 --> 20:35.420
- I said possibly peacefully.
- Even possibly...

20:35.527 --> 20:39.092
you cannot get on the stand
and give that testimony.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.165
You asked me
to review the autopsy-

20:41.264 --> 20:44.601
I hired you as an expert
witness to testy_ for the plaintiff...

20:44.702 --> 20:47.069
at $7,500 a day.

20:47.170 --> 20:49.663
My time may be forsake, counsel.

20:49.772 --> 20:51.902
My findings are not.

20:52.009 --> 20:55.310
You listen to me.
You are retired as a doctor.

20:55.410 --> 20:57.438
You make your living
as a playtimes expert.

20:57.547 --> 21:00.814
- You rely on firms such as this to refer you-
- Denise-

21:00.917 --> 21:03.284
Second chairing
does not involve speaking.

21:03.385 --> 21:06.322
- You're suborning perjury.
- I am not asking you to lie.

21:06.420 --> 21:10.018
I am encouraging you
to interpret your findings in a way-

21:10.123 --> 21:13.186
- You mean tailor them.
- She died in a nerd, forged sakes!

21:13.293 --> 21:16.265
- You're saying she didn't suffer?
- She may have suffered.

21:16.362 --> 21:18.593
But she may have died
without ever waking up.

21:18.698 --> 21:21.794
I do not want to hear
that word "peacefully. "

21:21.900 --> 21:24.805
You can say
maybe she died in her sleep.

21:24.904 --> 21:27.602
But you have no medical basis
to say that she died peacefully.

21:27.706 --> 21:30.677
I do not want to hear that word.

21:39.117 --> 21:42.521
We just had,
uh, excellent chemistry.

21:44.886 --> 21:48.121
Look, I promise you,
I never compromised the case or the firm.

21:48.223 --> 21:50.785
It was a personal, um, matter.

21:52.493 --> 21:55.660
You don't think you
compromised the firm, Mr. Wells?

21:55.763 --> 21:59.030
You are an associate
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

21:59.133 --> 22:02.299
Your behavior, personal
or otherwise, is a reflection...

22:02.401 --> 22:05.031
on Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

22:06.405 --> 22:08.307
I'm Schmidt!

22:10.109 --> 22:13.411
I exercised extremely poor judgment.
And all I can say is...

22:13.512 --> 22:16.973
it will never ever happen again.

22:17.082 --> 22:19.348
You can consider yourself
on serious probation.

22:19.450 --> 22:22.684
Yes, sir. Uh, ma'am.

22:23.954 --> 22:26.926
You may leave.

22:27.024 --> 22:29.494
And if ever hear
of your belt buckle...

22:29.592 --> 22:32.392
being so much as loose...

22:32.495 --> 22:34.487
you will be discharged.

22:34.596 --> 22:36.589
Yes, ma'am.

22:48.843 --> 22:51.780
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

22:51.878 --> 22:56.079
The truth is, I'm angry at myself
and I'm venting. I do that.

22:56.182 --> 22:59.280
It did sound a little like
you were suborning perjury.

22:59.385 --> 23:02.049
Dr. Forbes is as truthful
as they come.

23:02.154 --> 23:04.921
I was just reminding him,
perhaps a bit too forcefully...

23:05.024 --> 23:07.050
that we need him to be an advocate.

23:07.158 --> 23:09.459
Sara, hello.

23:09.561 --> 23:13.557
- It's good to see you again.
- Alan, this is a ladies' room.

23:13.664 --> 23:15.656
Yes. And such as it is,
I'll be brief.

23:15.765 --> 23:19.297
I just want to apologize
for last night.

23:19.403 --> 23:23.866
The thing is, with salmon,
my mind goes immediately to spawning.

23:23.972 --> 23:26.877
And to think that
these fish farms could-

23:28.810 --> 23:31.645
What I'm trying to say is...

23:31.745 --> 23:35.742
I'd like the chance to remake myself
once again in your eyes.

23:40.554 --> 23:43.252
- Shirley.
- Please leave the ladies' room, Alan.

23:43.356 --> 23:46.816
Yes. Sara.

23:46.925 --> 23:49.328
Denise.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.496
First, you.
What's with the mood?

23:55.600 --> 23:59.801
Wrongful death case. I thought we'd settle.
We're going to trial.

23:59.903 --> 24:02.271
- My damages.
- This the Pitino case?

24:02.371 --> 24:06.278
The woman was terminally ill.
My expert says she possibly didn’t even suffer.

24:06.376 --> 24:09.745
Is the jury going to care that her life
was shortened by a few days?

24:09.845 --> 24:11.747
Pain-ridden days at that?

24:11.848 --> 24:15.514
Denise, you can never count on people
to care about the problems of others.

24:15.618 --> 24:20.492
They will, however,
always deeply invest in their own.

24:23.958 --> 24:27.260
- Got it.
- What? I missed something. What?

24:27.361 --> 24:29.455
And, you.
What's Alan Shore up to?

24:29.562 --> 24:31.590
Evidently he wants to spawn.

24:31.698 --> 24:36.799
Ah. Well, we have a systemic problem
at this firm, don't we?

24:36.902 --> 24:39.464
- Lori was meeting with Meredith Waters today.
- Blink?

24:39.571 --> 24:42.941
- Who's Blink?
- She's who you hire when you're suing for sexual harassment.

24:43.041 --> 24:45.637
Blink was here?

24:53.450 --> 24:55.885
- Garrett.
- What are you doing here?

24:55.986 --> 24:57.887
I missed you.

24:57.987 --> 25:00.150
Cassie, I am in serious trouble
because of what happened.

25:00.256 --> 25:02.726
Oh, come on. That's why the sex
was so good, Garrett.

25:02.825 --> 25:05.489
Because you were breaking rules.
You weren’t just screwing me.

25:05.594 --> 25:08.064
You were screwing
this whole establishment that-

25:08.163 --> 25:10.291
Cassie, you shouldn't be here.

25:11.999 --> 25:13.970
You really need to go now.

25:14.069 --> 25:17.040
Okay. Just give me a quick tour.

25:17.138 --> 25:19.165
- I want to see where you work.
- I don't have time.

25:19.273 --> 25:23.906
- Then show me your file room.
- Cassie, I could lose my job. Maybe I already have.

25:24.011 --> 25:26.880
Really? Then how
about we just do it...

25:26.980 --> 25:29.576
right here in front of everyone
and you can go out in style.

25:29.682 --> 25:31.879
You need to go.

25:31.984 --> 25:34.386
I'm not leaving, Garrett...

25:34.485 --> 25:38.390
unless you promise to screw
my brains out tonight.

25:38.488 --> 25:41.928
- Okay.
- Say it.

25:42.026 --> 25:44.428
I want to hear you say it.

25:47.596 --> 25:50.032
Denny, look at me.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.035
I adore you.

25:52.135 --> 25:56.734
- And please don't interpret that as meaning I want you.
- You want me.

25:56.837 --> 26:00.676
I'm not going to explain to you
all the laws regarding sexual harassment.

26:00.775 --> 26:03.769
But the only way
to avoid a train wreck...

26:03.877 --> 26:06.074
where you become the victim...

26:06.180 --> 26:08.343
is for Lori to call this off.

26:08.448 --> 26:11.614
I apologized.
I said-

26:11.718 --> 26:13.846
You need to tee harder.

26:13.952 --> 26:18.587
One of the reasons I came back here,
Denny, you make me laugh.

26:21.459 --> 26:23.759
But this isn't funny.

26:36.307 --> 26:39.972
We'll begin with opening statements,
starting with the plaintiff.

26:46.382 --> 26:46.382
Good morning.
My name is Denise Bauer.

26:47.383 --> 26:50.286
Good morning.
My name is Denise Bauer.

26:50.385 --> 26:55.122
I, along with Sara Holt, will be
representing the plaintiff. Jose Pitino...

26:55.222 --> 26:59.356
whose wife Elena died in a fire that started
in their garage when their pickup truck...

26:59.458 --> 27:04.298
manufactured and sold by the defendant,
suddenly burst into flames.

27:04.398 --> 27:07.096
The truck was not running
at the time.

27:07.199 --> 27:09.431
In fact, it had not
been driven all night.

27:09.534 --> 27:14.340
Let me begin by saying that a terrible
human tragedy has occurred here.

27:14.439 --> 27:17.603
And of course,
nothing that happens...

27:17.708 --> 27:20.611
in this courtroom
will bring Elena Pitino back.

27:20.710 --> 27:26.313
Lawsuits, you see,
are ultimately about money.

27:26.417 --> 27:30.321
Putting a dollar figure
on suffering.

27:30.419 --> 27:35.692
Admittedly, there is some question as
to how much Elena even suffered in the fire.

27:35.791 --> 27:39.252
Also admittedly,
Elena was in the final stages...

27:39.361 --> 27:42.527
of ovarian cancer.

27:42.630 --> 27:44.531
She had come home
from the hospital...

27:44.631 --> 27:48.695
in fact that very day,
basically to die.

27:50.437 --> 27:55.345
You may ask yourselves,
what damages did she really endure?

27:55.442 --> 27:57.502
Well, you will hear
from José Pitino.

27:57.609 --> 28:01.207
And what you will hear
is that she had a day...

28:01.313 --> 28:04.945
and another day coming
after that...

28:05.049 --> 28:06.952
and another one after that.

28:07.051 --> 28:09.145
She had, in fact...

28:09.252 --> 28:14.662
six or seven days
to be at home with her family.

28:14.758 --> 28:20.098
She didn't get those days.
She never got that last opportunity...

28:20.196 --> 28:22.188
to sit with her grandchildren.

28:23.966 --> 28:28.406
Jose was never able
to hold his wife...

28:28.502 --> 28:32.100
of37 years in his arms-

28:37.109 --> 28:39.841
hold her in his arms
and, um-

28:44.383 --> 28:48.551
If any of you have spent
the final days with a loved one...

28:48.653 --> 28:50.782
dying of cancer
or another disease...

28:50.889 --> 28:56.092
you know that those moments
are the most precious.

28:58.262 --> 29:01.564
Jose and Elena Pitino
had those days coming.

29:01.664 --> 29:05.000
They didn't get them.

29:06.302 --> 29:09.535
You can't bring Elena Pitino back.

29:09.637 --> 29:14.204
But you are in a position
to help save others.

29:14.309 --> 29:19.216
Because lawsuits, in addition to money,
are about allocating burden.

29:19.313 --> 29:21.978
Who is best able...

29:22.082 --> 29:25.179
to prevent this tragedy
from happening again?

29:25.285 --> 29:29.953
Well, you might be inclined
to think this is just a freak accident.

29:30.055 --> 29:34.656
But in fact, this is
a much bigger problem.

29:34.760 --> 29:39.359
This is a very popular sport truck...

29:39.465 --> 29:44.236
made by a major manufacturer
of sport trucks.

29:44.335 --> 29:47.136
And they're catching fire.

29:47.238 --> 29:51.267
The defendant has recently recalled
almost a million of their vehicles...

29:51.376 --> 29:53.469
because of this malfunction.

29:53.575 --> 29:56.045
So, you see?

29:56.144 --> 29:59.709
This is potentially your problem.

30:01.049 --> 30:04.921
How do you motivate
a corporate conglomerate...

30:05.020 --> 30:07.582
to fix a defect?

30:09.757 --> 30:12.387
You make it too expensive
for them not to.

30:16.496 --> 30:18.898
At the conclusion of this trial...

30:18.997 --> 30:21.993
when it finally comes down
to a dollar amount...

30:22.101 --> 30:25.129
I'll be asking you
to be legislators...

30:25.237 --> 30:28.801
and come back with a number
that says to the defendant...

30:28.906 --> 30:34.280
J and all car manufacturers
make your vehicles safe.

30:36.012 --> 30:38.482
For your sake.

30:39.615 --> 30:41.676
For your daughters.

30:41.784 --> 30:43.913
For your grandsons.

30:45.588 --> 30:49.494
And I'll ask you to be human beings...

30:49.592 --> 30:53.122
the conscience of
a compassionate society...

30:53.227 --> 30:56.688
and return with a verdict
that somehow reflects...

30:56.798 --> 31:00.635
everything that was taken
from Elena Pitino...

31:00.734 --> 31:04.263
her family,
and most offal...

31:08.075 --> 31:10.477
her high-school sweetheart.

31:40.735 --> 31:42.967
They just got off the elevator.

31:43.070 --> 31:45.941
I don't care what the offer is,
nobody reacts.

31:46.041 --> 31:48.705
Let me do the talking.
All obit.

31:48.809 --> 31:51.780
- Must be a much bigger offer if they expect-
- Let’s just see.

31:51.879 --> 31:54.679
Once again, nobody speaks.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.752
- Denise.
- Welcome back.

31:58.852 --> 32:01.414
Mr. Pitino, Miss Holt.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.356
- It's okay to say hello.
- Hi.

32:05.457 --> 32:08.394
We're due back in court at 4:OO unless
we settle this. Do you have a number?

32:08.493 --> 32:13.265
We do. Let me preface by saying that the client
is making this offer against my advice.

32:13.363 --> 32:17.997
- I feel it is far too generous.
- Of course. What is it?

32:22.004 --> 32:23.939
Oh, my God.

32:25.274 --> 32:28.769
Too low. It's too low.

32:28.877 --> 32:31.906
- What about punitive?
- That's everything, Denise.

32:32.013 --> 32:34.039
You either take it or go back.

32:43.023 --> 32:45.391
I think there's more.

32:46.825 --> 32:49.455
This is good, Denise.

32:49.561 --> 32:52.432
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.870
Okay.

32:59.905 --> 33:03.274
Well, back to court we go.

33:03.374 --> 33:05.310
You can't be serious.

33:05.409 --> 33:08.472
Duruy research consultant says we should
get something with a two. I trust them.

33:08.578 --> 33:12.108
- Let's go.
- 1.7. That's as high as I'm authorized.

33:12.214 --> 33:13.945
- Payable now?
- All obit.

33:14.049 --> 33:15.143
- Done.
- No admission.

33:15.251 --> 33:17.242
- Check by end of business tomorrow?
- Done.

33:17.351 --> 33:19.048
- You'll draft?
- Yes.

33:19.153 --> 33:20.816
Congratulations, Mr. Pitino.

33:20.922 --> 33:23.358
And, uh, let me say personally...

33:23.458 --> 33:25.621
I'm vey sorry for your loss.

33:34.533 --> 33:36.800
I don't know what to say.

33:36.901 --> 33:39.600
Jose, I just want you to know...

33:39.705 --> 33:41.937
I would've never let the 1.4 go.

33:45.509 --> 33:49.245
I-
I think I need to go to the bathroom.

33:53.116 --> 33:55.586
I- I don't want to cy
in front of you.

33:55.685 --> 33:58.315
So that's why I'm going.

34:00.456 --> 34:03.018
Thank you, Denise. I-

34:13.567 --> 34:17.768
If you ever want to join my weekly
poker game, you are more than invited.

34:17.871 --> 34:20.842
- Can I just say that-
- You have other work to do?

34:20.938 --> 34:25.208
- Yes.
- Go do it, please.

34:51.400 --> 34:55.203
Cassie, look, this-
It doesn't feel right.

34:55.304 --> 34:57.797
Okay.

34:57.906 --> 34:59.876
I love you. Better?

34:59.974 --> 35:02.376
This feels angry.
What's wrong?

35:02.477 --> 35:05.346
There's nothing wrong with me!

35:05.446 --> 35:08.508
What's wrong with you?
Just-

35:08.615 --> 35:10.585
I'm done.

35:14.353 --> 35:16.983
I don't know
what's going on, but-

35:22.193 --> 35:24.164
Look, let’s just, uh-

35:24.262 --> 35:26.424
They killed my brother.

35:26.530 --> 35:29.023
Excuse me?

35:31.802 --> 35:33.897
My- My little brother.

35:35.206 --> 35:37.436
He's dead.

35:43.111 --> 35:45.080
Last week...

35:47.148 --> 35:50.553
in Baghdad, he was-

35:50.652 --> 35:54.056
he was guarding some-
some stupid truck.

36:02.628 --> 36:05.099
And somebody blew it up.

36:07.899 --> 36:11.896
He- He was only 18.

36:14.839 --> 36:18.277
They-They killed him.

36:21.645 --> 36:26.110
He's my- my baby brother
and he's not coming home.

36:26.216 --> 36:28.743
He's-

36:28.852 --> 36:31.721
Just get off me!

36:36.023 --> 36:39.224
Can I get them for that?

36:39.327 --> 36:42.162
I want to get them.

36:43.397 --> 36:46.163
Can I get them?

36:51.069 --> 36:54.440
The thing about an apology
is it may make you a bigger man...

36:54.540 --> 36:57.102
but the experience of saying it...

36:57.209 --> 36:59.679
makes you feel vestal.

37:01.312 --> 37:04.581
I'm sorry. I really am.

37:06.716 --> 37:10.656
- Why did you call me chubby?
- I didn't mean anything by it.

37:10.754 --> 37:13.624
Well, it hurt.

37:13.723 --> 37:17.128
Well, see-

37:17.227 --> 37:22.362
What I don't get is you know how much
I care about you. Admire you even.

37:22.464 --> 37:25.800
I suppose I'm not feeling that.

37:28.469 --> 37:30.871
I hesitate to admit this...

37:30.971 --> 37:35.811
but when I was seven years old...

37:35.910 --> 37:37.879
I was a fatty.

37:37.977 --> 37:42.007
During my parents' divorce,
my mother had a lawyer.

37:42.113 --> 37:46.315
She was thin, smart, secure,
confident in mind and body.

37:46.418 --> 37:50.951
And I said to myself,
"That's what I'm going to be when I grow up. "

37:51.056 --> 37:53.025
And I did grow up to be her...

37:53.123 --> 37:55.958
or so I thought.

37:56.060 --> 37:59.088
I haven't been feeling
very secure lately, Denny...

37:59.195 --> 38:01.757
either in mind or body.

38:01.864 --> 38:04.768
My skin has become
increasingly thin...

38:04.867 --> 38:08.738
with all of the sexual banter
in the office.

38:08.838 --> 38:11.900
I've been feeling marginalized
as an attorney.

38:13.108 --> 38:15.475
Maybe it's because
this is such a boys club.

38:15.578 --> 38:17.478
I don't know.

38:18.779 --> 38:22.583
But I'm struggling here, Denny.

38:36.328 --> 38:38.821
I'll admit to being bad
only if you discipline me.

38:38.931 --> 38:43.064
I don't think it's a good idea for you
to hound first-year associates.

38:43.166 --> 38:46.230
I don't "hound" first-year associates,
Shirley. I tickle them.

38:46.337 --> 38:48.705
As for Sara Holt,
I barely touched her.

38:48.806 --> 38:51.606
My concern isn't for Sara
as much as it is you.

38:51.708 --> 38:55.112
It makes you look sad.

38:55.211 --> 38:56.907
Even pathetic.

39:00.683 --> 39:02.618
What is it about young women?

39:02.717 --> 39:06.919
Is it simply a matter
of improving blood flow?

39:09.290 --> 39:12.523
I'm not so much attracted
to younger women.

39:12.626 --> 39:15.358
It's more the idea that
they could be attracted to me.

39:18.364 --> 39:20.766
You know, you women have it lucky.

39:20.866 --> 39:23.269
As you age,
you only get more beautiful.

39:23.368 --> 39:27.274
Men, we get fat and less desirable.

39:29.908 --> 39:32.538
You and Denny need to find
other ways to have fun...

39:32.643 --> 39:36.412
than being lecherous
with junior associates.

39:51.593 --> 39:54.325
Not the cigar in the ear again?

39:54.429 --> 39:57.731
I need to amuse myself
in ways I can't get sued.

39:57.832 --> 40:01.738
Lori Colson evidently met with Blink Waters.
You may, in fact, get sued.

40:04.136 --> 40:07.472
Shirley says we need
to behave better.

40:09.775 --> 40:14.773
If she really knew us deep down,
she'd realize we behave pretty damn well.

40:14.879 --> 40:18.910
I miss Tara.
Not that she was-

40:23.022 --> 40:25.618
I don't like having dinner alone,
sleeping alone.

40:25.723 --> 40:28.592
Having sex alone.

40:28.692 --> 40:31.322
Do you think it's pathetic?

40:34.629 --> 40:38.627
Should we be married
and sensible and go home...

40:38.733 --> 40:41.762
to do whatever men do at home?

40:41.870 --> 40:44.773
Well, I have nothing against marriage.
I've done it five times.

40:44.872 --> 40:46.934
But here's the thing about wives.

40:47.042 --> 40:50.480
They don't let you play
with your friends.

40:50.577 --> 40:53.812
I couldn't be standing outside here
every night on this balcony if-

40:56.282 --> 40:58.809
I'll take a friend
over a wife every time.

40:58.918 --> 41:02.379
Shouldn't a wife
be your best friend?

41:03.823 --> 41:07.056
You know,
Ralph Waldo Emerson said...

41:07.158 --> 41:10.961
he reckoned a friend to be
the masterpiece of nature.

41:13.296 --> 41:18.238
I'm not sure I truly understood
that before I met you, Denny.

41:21.071 --> 41:24.909
- I'm not having sex with you.
- Just the same.

41:34.282 --> 41:36.878
Lori really might sue?

41:36.985 --> 41:39.615
She met with Blink.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.469
You stinker!
