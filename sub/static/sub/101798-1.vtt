WEBVTT

01:21.207 --> 01:22.439
You know if your plan

01:22.441 --> 01:24.474
is to ultimately
burn something down,

01:24.476 --> 01:27.944
you should never show
it too much love.

01:27.946 --> 01:29.379
Yeah.

01:29.381 --> 01:32.016
Never built a real fire before.

01:33.352 --> 01:34.687
You'll get it.

01:36.555 --> 01:39.055
How much
have you had to drink?

01:39.057 --> 01:41.793
Nowhere near
enough, my friend.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.129
To murky pasts.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.533
Ah, should
she be getting that close?

01:49.535 --> 01:51.401
Well, guess we'll
find out, huh?

01:53.706 --> 01:55.239
Are you...

01:55.241 --> 01:56.040
Shit.

02:05.417 --> 02:06.250
Hey, are you okay?

02:10.489 --> 02:12.224
Babe, are you okay?

02:13.659 --> 02:15.992
Would you even give a
shit if I died out there?

02:15.994 --> 02:17.561
Hey, you're bleeding.
Let me help you.

02:17.563 --> 02:19.061
Leave me alone.

02:19.063 --> 02:21.365
I'm gonna show it to my
boyfriend, real up close.

02:21.367 --> 02:23.032
One injury's enough, you guys.

02:23.034 --> 02:24.834
She won't let me help her.

02:24.836 --> 02:25.901
Let him help you.

02:25.903 --> 02:26.737
I don't need it.

02:26.739 --> 02:28.104
Yeah, you do.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.407
It's pretty ironic
coming from you, Jaq.

02:30.409 --> 02:31.843
Good one, Dash.

02:35.046 --> 02:37.281
Come on, baby, let's
get you cleaned up.

02:42.554 --> 02:45.957
Yeah, I guess I'll
just grab the board.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.029
500 grand?

02:53.031 --> 02:55.365
Where's our discount,
our fucking loyalty card

02:55.367 --> 02:56.300
up in this bitch?

02:56.302 --> 02:57.967
You want a loyalty card?

02:57.969 --> 03:00.803
You fuck off and
get medical ID card.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.908
This meth's so good it
turned me Chinese.

03:05.511 --> 03:08.612
Do you hear the way your
daughter's talking to me, Mr. Wu?

03:08.614 --> 03:09.812
Oh, don't you play coy with me.

03:09.814 --> 03:10.980
I know you're over
there plotting

03:10.982 --> 03:13.550
some Kung Fu master
shit right now.

03:13.552 --> 03:15.319
Best crystal in town.

03:15.321 --> 03:16.921
No one better cook.

03:21.160 --> 03:21.993
350.

03:23.595 --> 03:25.329
And you can tell
Mr. Wu to throw in

03:25.331 --> 03:29.666
some of those Samurai Gray
roll-ups you got over there.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.101
This cat, not a
fucking peep ever.

03:34.506 --> 03:35.774
You know why?

03:36.642 --> 03:38.642
He deaf as a door post.

03:38.644 --> 03:41.944
You dumb motherfucker.

03:41.946 --> 03:43.647
DEA freeze!

03:43.649 --> 03:44.847
Nobody move.

03:44.849 --> 03:47.016
Anybody who moves
gets a lead breakfast.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.491
You two fuck off.

03:55.860 --> 03:59.698
Put your arms down. This
isn't CrossFit class.

04:00.932 --> 04:03.032
Do you know who I am?

04:03.034 --> 04:04.536
Crowe.

04:06.971 --> 04:10.309
Man of few words
but profound meaning.

04:14.713 --> 04:18.648
I like that sitting style that
waitresses do at the Hooters.

04:18.650 --> 04:21.818
It creates an air
of informality.

04:21.820 --> 04:25.054
The customers think that the
waitress is their friend.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.858
But it's all just
an elaborate act.

04:27.860 --> 04:29.892
She doesn't give
a shit about them.

04:29.894 --> 04:33.563
All she cares about is
that nice, juicy tip

04:33.565 --> 04:35.732
that's coming at
the end of the night

04:35.734 --> 04:38.235
and she knows full well
the customers only care

04:38.237 --> 04:41.070
about nice, juicy tits
that are going to be

04:41.072 --> 04:45.709
in their faces for the
duration of their visit.

04:45.711 --> 04:49.011
This is how exploitation
works, you see.

04:56.988 --> 04:59.256
In case you haven't
gotten it yet,

04:59.258 --> 05:01.591
I'm the waitress,
you're the customers.

05:01.593 --> 05:02.992
I want you to have a good night.

05:02.994 --> 05:05.595
Indulge in whatever
turns you on.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.364
However, the only reason

05:07.366 --> 05:10.099
I'm being in any way
hospitable right now

05:10.101 --> 05:12.436
is simply because
I'm sure as shit

05:12.438 --> 05:14.771
walking out the
door with that tip

05:14.773 --> 05:19.278
by the end of my shift.

05:27.051 --> 05:29.419
I see we're doing this
in broad daylight now.

05:29.421 --> 05:30.887
What are you afraid of, Lemon,

05:30.889 --> 05:32.522
the long arm of the law?

05:32.524 --> 05:34.291
Will you do me a favor,
when those guys are around,

05:34.293 --> 05:35.792
don't call me Lemon.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.092
As long as you're
on my payroll,

05:37.094 --> 05:41.631
I can call you whatever
the fuck I want, Leaman.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.816
Oh oh.

05:59.818 --> 06:00.983
Don't get frustrated.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.652
The mystery's the best part.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.221
Savor it.

06:04.223 --> 06:05.322
I need a hammer.

06:07.992 --> 06:08.825
Don't cry.

06:08.827 --> 06:09.960
You guys hear that?

06:09.962 --> 06:12.063
Oh my god, signal. Yes!

06:14.500 --> 06:16.335
Welcome to paradise.

06:18.570 --> 06:22.639
Hey, guys, we have
some gear that needs checking.

06:22.641 --> 06:24.140
What could be more
important than that?

06:24.142 --> 06:27.344
Uh, the Dow Jones,
the NASDAQ, the S&P 500?

06:27.346 --> 06:29.613
How much real money can you
be making right now, honestly?

06:29.615 --> 06:31.481
Look, I have to know
what the markets are doing

06:31.483 --> 06:33.683
to know where the
opportunities lie.

06:33.685 --> 06:37.019
Numbers and pixels, just a
made up version of the world.

06:37.021 --> 06:38.522
What you found today is real.

06:38.524 --> 06:40.357
Are you saying that
there could be $10 million

06:40.359 --> 06:42.259
hidden in this tiny little box?

06:42.261 --> 06:44.361
Because if so, I will
pry this thing open

06:44.363 --> 06:46.830
with my bare hands right now.

06:46.832 --> 06:48.331
I'm just saying
we don't always know

06:48.333 --> 06:51.334
what we're looking for
until we finally find it.

06:51.336 --> 06:53.503
Wow, you have
like 20 missed calls

06:53.505 --> 06:54.971
and a bunch of messages.

06:54.973 --> 06:56.038
All right, say switch it off.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.641
I don't give a shit.

06:57.643 --> 07:00.210
Wait, you did move your
shifts for this week right?

07:00.212 --> 07:02.279
You know
I hate my job but-

07:02.281 --> 07:03.446
- You hate every job.

07:03.448 --> 07:04.881
'Cause I'm a
minimum wage bitch.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.816
You need a job.
Everyone needs a job.

07:06.818 --> 07:07.717
Oh yeah I do?

07:07.719 --> 07:09.152
Well, he doesn't.

07:09.154 --> 07:11.354
Look at him, at the beck
and call of his computer

07:11.356 --> 07:12.956
gambling just to feel alive.

07:12.958 --> 07:14.124
It's a damn sight better

07:14.126 --> 07:15.992
than scraping
barnacles off boats.

07:15.994 --> 07:17.227
Oh, is it, really?

07:17.229 --> 07:18.528
Or is slowly selling
your soul to the devil

07:18.530 --> 07:19.796
easier for you to stomach?

07:19.798 --> 07:20.632
Guys!

07:23.368 --> 07:25.470
How about we go someplace

07:26.672 --> 07:29.973
where there definitely
is no signal?

07:29.975 --> 07:31.408
I'd love that.

07:43.188 --> 07:44.921
This better be worth it.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.325
It's tradition.

07:54.032 --> 07:55.899
Wow.

07:55.901 --> 07:58.735
So you guys brought me
to meet the Grim Reaper.

07:58.737 --> 08:01.338
Santa Muerte, she's a deity.

08:01.340 --> 08:03.506
The Catholic Church
used to condemn anybody

08:03.508 --> 08:06.843
who worshiped her so
people came here in secret.

08:06.845 --> 08:08.778
This whole island it's hers.

08:08.780 --> 08:11.047
Every time we come,
we pay our respects

08:11.049 --> 08:13.249
and she watches over us.

08:13.251 --> 08:14.584
The colors used here to burn

08:14.586 --> 08:16.453
represent her different robes.

08:16.455 --> 08:19.022
White for purity
and blue for wisdom,

08:19.024 --> 08:20.857
red for love.

08:20.859 --> 08:22.292
And the black?

08:22.294 --> 08:24.861
Smugglers protected
their treasure

08:24.863 --> 08:26.229
with the Black Lady.

08:26.231 --> 08:27.364
And if you ever see

08:27.366 --> 08:30.135
the Black Lady
around here, you run.

08:39.578 --> 08:41.411
You'll never crack that.

08:41.413 --> 08:42.545
Challenge accepted.

08:42.547 --> 08:43.380
Ooh.

08:43.382 --> 08:44.783
Ooh, ah.

08:46.985 --> 08:50.754
I'd do this for the rest
of my life if I could.

08:50.756 --> 08:52.656
Why don't we
steal the sailboat?

08:52.658 --> 08:54.591
I mean, how would
they ever find it?

08:56.428 --> 08:58.595
It's not as easy
as it sounds, bro.

08:58.597 --> 09:01.231
It's not easy but I know how
you could get away with it.

09:01.233 --> 09:03.333
The real question is
are you ready to spend

09:03.335 --> 09:05.136
the rest of your
life as a pirate?

09:07.105 --> 09:08.571
Maybe.

09:08.573 --> 09:10.173
But people can change.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.408
Can life change though?

09:12.644 --> 09:16.179
Oh, there goes
our peace and quiet.

09:16.181 --> 09:19.182
Weekend warriors,
you gotta love 'em.

09:20.686 --> 09:21.520
No.

09:22.988 --> 09:24.454
Ah.

09:24.456 --> 09:26.157
It's a sample.

09:26.159 --> 09:27.924
It's your treasure.

09:28.927 --> 09:30.161
What is it?

09:30.163 --> 09:32.696
I guess you really
are a pirate now.

09:32.698 --> 09:36.633
Uh, next time,
though, you find a map.

09:36.635 --> 09:38.802
One of us.

09:38.804 --> 09:40.537
ROSIE, DASH, JAQ: One of us!

09:44.843 --> 09:47.477
No one answered my
question by the way.

09:47.479 --> 09:49.546
Can life actually change though?

09:49.548 --> 09:50.547
You're dunk.

09:50.549 --> 09:53.184
- Seriously, answer it.
- Come on.

09:53.186 --> 09:54.019
Fine. No.

09:56.855 --> 10:00.890
I think all we can hope
to change is ourselves.

10:00.892 --> 10:03.727
Life is completely
out of our control.

10:03.729 --> 10:04.663
You know...

10:11.069 --> 10:11.903
Monkey.

10:13.572 --> 10:14.406
Oh.

10:15.540 --> 10:18.510
Monkey, monkey,
monkey see, monkey do.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.582
Look, I know that I'm
probably not the kinda guy

10:25.584 --> 10:26.416
you go for-

10:26.418 --> 10:27.383
- That's, don't-

10:27.385 --> 10:29.755
- But I would give it all up.

10:31.022 --> 10:33.923
The money, the
opportunities, the lifestyle

10:33.925 --> 10:35.228
to be that guy.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.095
I'm not somebody
who can be loved.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.331
I can become that person.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.733
You just, you gotta let me try.

10:43.735 --> 10:46.669
No, it's not about
you being wrong for me.

10:46.671 --> 10:51.374
It's about me being very,
very wrong for anybody else.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.518
So that's it?

11:00.752 --> 11:04.788
The old it's
not you, it's me thing.

11:04.790 --> 11:05.855
Shit.

12:18.697 --> 12:21.265
Try it. See what happens.

12:21.267 --> 12:22.299
Heads up, Jaquer!

12:22.301 --> 12:23.466
Heads up!

12:23.468 --> 12:25.336
- Get her out!
- Stop, no!

12:26.339 --> 12:28.037
I'm done with boys.

12:28.039 --> 12:30.440
We got her ass.

12:45.724 --> 12:48.160
Do you wanna talk about it?

12:49.561 --> 12:52.695
You know what the danger
of believing in something is?

12:52.697 --> 12:56.166
Your faith eventually
gets tested.

12:56.168 --> 12:56.968
Baby.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.205
Baby.

13:00.639 --> 13:03.573
We're gonna fix it, you know.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.541
We're gonna get you a new life.

13:05.543 --> 13:09.545
We're gonna scrape by,
we're gonna save up.

13:09.547 --> 13:12.749
You've gotta tell
us what's going on.

13:12.751 --> 13:15.152
What are we talking about?

13:17.223 --> 13:18.922
I saw the Black Lady.

13:20.091 --> 13:22.226
She's down there
protecting something.

13:23.695 --> 13:26.196
I thought that the only time
you see the Black Lady is,

13:26.198 --> 13:27.730
or whatever she's called,

13:27.732 --> 13:31.434
is when someone's using her
to protect a treasure, right?

13:31.436 --> 13:33.436
The only treasure around here,

13:33.438 --> 13:35.239
if you can call
it that, is drugs.

13:35.241 --> 13:37.842
It's something bad, real bad.

13:38.944 --> 13:41.245
I mean, you saw the shrine.

13:41.247 --> 13:42.445
Well, if there's
drugs down there,

13:42.447 --> 13:44.714
we should definitely go
down and destroy them.

13:44.716 --> 13:45.949
- No.
- That's what she would want.

13:45.951 --> 13:48.185
Yeah, it's the
moral thing to do.

13:48.187 --> 13:50.520
Come on, guys, let's
fuck up a bad guy's day.

13:50.522 --> 13:52.855
Whoa, hold on
there, chief, okay?

13:52.857 --> 13:54.624
If there are drugs down there,

13:54.626 --> 13:57.927
I say we take them
and we sell them.

13:57.929 --> 13:59.562
That is a terrible idea, Dash.

13:59.564 --> 14:00.530
I think it's a great idea.

14:00.532 --> 14:01.798
Why?

14:01.800 --> 14:03.032
I mean, by your logic
having money is fine,

14:03.034 --> 14:04.234
it's just the
chasing after money

14:04.236 --> 14:05.302
- that fucks people up, right?
- Yep.

14:05.304 --> 14:06.536
Thank you, see.

14:06.538 --> 14:08.104
You telling me you
wannabe Scar Faces

14:08.106 --> 14:10.039
know how to move narcotics,

14:10.041 --> 14:12.309
how to keep shit on
the down-low, hm?

14:12.311 --> 14:14.744
You also think I'm gonna let
an ounce of smack or coke

14:14.746 --> 14:16.980
on this boat with a
recovering addict onboard?

14:16.982 --> 14:17.814
I don't think so.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.649
Recovered addict.

14:19.651 --> 14:22.552
You know what?
Shame on you, Jaq.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.265
We got enough air?

14:35.267 --> 14:36.933
Maybe.

14:36.935 --> 14:38.302
Who's going with me?

14:38.304 --> 14:39.635
Are you kidding me?

14:39.637 --> 14:42.139
I'm not going back down there.

14:46.445 --> 14:49.612
It's empty. They headed
to the island an hour ago.

14:49.614 --> 14:51.014
You gonna bring those
keen eyes down below

14:51.016 --> 14:52.949
where they'd be useful?

14:52.951 --> 14:54.684
I'll do it.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.320
I'll go down with you.

14:56.322 --> 14:57.854
Works for me.

14:57.856 --> 15:01.526
Looks like a worthy
sacrifice has been found.

15:02.361 --> 15:04.294
Let's do it.

15:12.505 --> 15:15.538
I don't like them
down there with her.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.540
If this is what
we think it is,

15:17.542 --> 15:20.146
she's the least of our worries.

15:37.829 --> 15:39.498
They're coming up.

15:41.534 --> 15:45.735
What is floating up?

15:47.406 --> 15:49.173
- Oh my god.
- Hey, Jaq.

15:49.175 --> 15:51.177
You wanna do the honors?

15:59.518 --> 16:00.983
Holy shit.

16:00.985 --> 16:02.519
- Oh my god!
- Worth everything!

16:02.521 --> 16:03.753
Oh my god.

16:04.722 --> 16:07.491
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

16:07.493 --> 16:08.325
Here.

16:08.327 --> 16:09.159
Hold on.

16:09.161 --> 16:11.528
Oh my god, oh my god.

16:11.530 --> 16:12.563
Catch it.

16:12.565 --> 16:14.431
- Hey!
- Here, keep going!

16:14.433 --> 16:16.032
Yeah!

16:16.034 --> 16:16.899
Guys!

16:16.901 --> 16:18.835
- Nice catch.
- Oh!

16:18.837 --> 16:19.671
Oh!

16:20.939 --> 16:22.206
Ah!

16:22.208 --> 16:23.275
Oh.

16:26.512 --> 16:27.610
Get it.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.078
Go, grab from it!

16:29.080 --> 16:30.349
Okay.

16:31.383 --> 16:35.219
Woo!

16:35.221 --> 16:36.953
That's it.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.589
What, is that like
a million dollars?

16:39.791 --> 16:41.924
It's more like
10 million, right?

16:41.926 --> 16:43.127
Try 50.

16:43.129 --> 16:45.596
Don't tug at my dick
on this one, Jaquer.

16:45.598 --> 16:47.063
There's no way this is 50 mil.

16:47.065 --> 16:48.898
No, there's like
500,000 per pack.

16:48.900 --> 16:50.967
There's a hundred packs.

16:50.969 --> 16:51.968
You do the math.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.237
Holy shit!

16:53.239 --> 16:54.438
It's $50
million.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.206
This is 50 fucking
million dollars, Monkey.

16:56.208 --> 16:57.907
But that's more than 10
million apiece, right?

16:57.909 --> 16:59.476
Wait we stole $50 million?

16:59.478 --> 17:01.278
We rescued $50 million.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.645
We're gonna be okay.

17:02.647 --> 17:03.480
It's gonna be okay.

17:03.482 --> 17:04.481
Come here, come here.

17:04.483 --> 17:05.317
Oh!

17:07.886 --> 17:09.488
Throw it back in.

17:11.789 --> 17:12.722
What?

17:12.724 --> 17:14.291
What are you talking about?

17:14.293 --> 17:17.093
You think you're
rich? Think again.

17:17.095 --> 17:19.129
Take a look at these notes.

17:19.131 --> 17:22.665
Pristine, sequential,
high-value currency.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.501
I hate to tell you this
but whoever owes this cash

17:24.503 --> 17:26.637
is thumbing their nose at
whoever they're paying off.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.906
They've made it as hard
to find as possible

17:29.908 --> 17:32.476
and even harder to handle.

17:32.478 --> 17:35.612
This is $50 million of
pure fuck you money.

17:35.614 --> 17:38.582
No, bullshit,
Jaquer, bullshit.

17:38.584 --> 17:39.815
'Cause you know
what I'm gonna do?

17:39.817 --> 17:41.083
I'm gonna take my
20 million plus

17:41.085 --> 17:42.685
and I'm gonna stash her
underneath my mattress.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.754
Yeah. Nice and simple.

17:44.756 --> 17:46.323
Now, I've got the
bank under my bed

17:46.325 --> 17:48.158
and I'm the fucking teller.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.091
And you know what
the teller says

17:49.093 --> 17:50.327
at the bank of Daniel Schrader

17:50.329 --> 17:52.762
each time he goes to
make a withdrawal?

17:52.764 --> 17:55.365
Go and spend that money
the best way you know how.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.867
Spend that soggy,
devil-woman money

17:57.869 --> 17:59.035
as you damn well please.

17:59.037 --> 18:00.604
She's not a soggy devil woman.

18:00.606 --> 18:02.606
You're right! She's
our guardian angel.

18:02.608 --> 18:03.706
Yes!

18:03.708 --> 18:04.774
Is that right, Dash?

18:04.776 --> 18:05.609
You're gonna buy a flashy car?

18:05.611 --> 18:07.477
Yeah, cars, plural.

18:07.479 --> 18:09.011
You gonna buy a big house too?

18:09.013 --> 18:10.046
Huh, well, I have to
have somewhere to stash it,

18:10.048 --> 18:11.648
don't I, Jaquer?

18:11.650 --> 18:13.550
She's right.

18:13.552 --> 18:15.017
She's right.

18:15.019 --> 18:16.953
I mean, no car dealership,
no real estate agent,

18:16.955 --> 18:18.322
no bank manager is
gonna let you slide

18:18.324 --> 18:20.890
this kinda big money
across the table

18:20.892 --> 18:23.025
without treating it
as highly suspicious.

18:23.027 --> 18:25.462
Just one zero number flags
up and you've got to explain

18:25.464 --> 18:28.565
why you've got $20 million
stashed under your bed,

18:28.567 --> 18:30.733
where you got it,
how you got it.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.135
And no one's gonna
believe you simply,

18:32.137 --> 18:33.470
you've been running a
really long paper route

18:33.472 --> 18:35.339
for the few decades.

18:35.341 --> 18:37.509
We can't have the money?

18:39.478 --> 18:41.010
Wait.

18:41.012 --> 18:44.013
Wait, you guys are always
talking about opportunity.

18:44.015 --> 18:47.317
This, right here,
this is opportunity.

18:47.319 --> 18:48.851
Okay, there's a part
of me that's saying

18:48.853 --> 18:52.021
let's take the cash and hire
the best damn lawyers around

18:52.023 --> 18:53.156
and come what may.

18:53.158 --> 18:54.824
Yes, yes!

18:54.826 --> 18:56.393
Okay, he's thinking, okay.

18:56.395 --> 18:58.027
Yes, and where are you going?

18:58.029 --> 19:00.530
Oh, way to ruin
our dreams, Mom.

19:00.532 --> 19:01.567
Fucking shit.

19:05.337 --> 19:06.570
What'd you call me?

19:06.572 --> 19:08.104
Oh, I'm sorry,
that was out of line.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.907
My mom's not a bitch.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.449
How far are you
all willing to go

19:19.451 --> 19:22.419
to turn $50 million
of dirty drug money

19:22.421 --> 19:25.121
into something you can
actually cash in, hm?

19:25.123 --> 19:26.690
How serious are you?

19:26.692 --> 19:29.194
Deadly fucking serious. Why?

19:30.061 --> 19:31.461
You?

19:31.463 --> 19:33.062
I'm certainly listening.

19:33.064 --> 19:34.264
Rosie?

19:34.266 --> 19:37.267
What, like commit
a crime serious?

19:37.269 --> 19:39.269
I know how to get
that money cleaned.

19:39.271 --> 19:40.737
I don't want any questions
about how I know.

19:40.739 --> 19:43.607
I don't want any questions
about why I know.

19:43.609 --> 19:46.777
All I need from you is a
willingness to take a few risks,

19:46.779 --> 19:48.412
break a few laws,

19:48.414 --> 19:50.781
potentially piss off
the crazy motherfucker

19:50.783 --> 19:52.616
this likely belongs to.

19:52.618 --> 19:54.484
'Cause we're leaving right now.

19:55.421 --> 19:57.822
And you decide whether or not

19:59.158 --> 20:01.658
we try to turn this into bank

20:01.660 --> 20:03.826
or we throw it back
in where we found it.

20:03.828 --> 20:07.130
But leaving right now,
Jaq, there's no wind.

20:07.132 --> 20:09.166
Unless you're gonna blow
a force nine out your ass,

20:09.168 --> 20:11.601
we're pretty much sitting
ducks for the time being.

20:11.603 --> 20:13.969
We're not playing
by the rules anymore

20:13.971 --> 20:17.643
and we're not letting
anything hold us back.

21:12.231 --> 21:13.663
First thing I'm
doing is investing,

21:13.665 --> 21:14.897
make this money work for me

21:14.899 --> 21:16.199
rather than the
other way around.

21:16.201 --> 21:17.367
Yes, I love that.

21:17.369 --> 21:19.969
I just can't
imagine being rich.

21:19.971 --> 21:24.073
Oh well, baby, just
gotta open your mind.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.409
This evens us all out, right?

21:25.411 --> 21:27.076
Eliminates any differences?

21:27.078 --> 21:28.812
Well, I guess that depends

21:28.814 --> 21:31.815
if you see people as
products of their potential

21:31.817 --> 21:33.750
or products of their past.

21:33.752 --> 21:36.219
What in anybody's
past could be bigger

21:36.221 --> 21:38.087
than finding $50 million?

21:38.089 --> 21:39.358
Please tell me.

21:42.394 --> 21:43.226
Baby girl.

21:43.228 --> 21:44.028
Yeah.

21:45.197 --> 21:46.830
Need you to relax.

21:46.832 --> 21:47.930
Okay.

21:47.932 --> 21:48.732
- Don't force it.
- Okay.

21:48.734 --> 21:49.566
- Okay?
- Okay.

21:50.402 --> 21:51.368
Breathe with me.

21:51.370 --> 21:54.504
Just see what you wanna see.

21:55.340 --> 21:56.673
What do you see?

21:56.675 --> 21:57.443
Oh wow.

21:58.410 --> 21:59.975
- Oh I see it.
- You see it?

21:59.977 --> 22:01.278
Oh, I see it.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.077
You see it?

22:02.079 --> 22:04.448
We are happy and rich.

22:04.450 --> 22:06.216
- Yes.
- Oh, we're so freakin' happy!

22:06.218 --> 22:07.049
Yes!

22:07.051 --> 22:08.618
Muah!

22:08.620 --> 22:10.119
Woo!

22:10.121 --> 22:11.288
That's what I'm talking about!

22:11.290 --> 22:12.255
Yeah, baby.

22:12.257 --> 22:13.190
Yeah.

22:13.192 --> 22:14.925
JAQ, DASH, ROSIE: Cheers!

22:14.927 --> 22:18.263
Yeah!

22:56.969 --> 22:58.401
They say the devil
never dresses down

22:58.403 --> 23:01.505
because pride is the
deadliest of the seven sins.

23:01.507 --> 23:03.308
Looking good, Zalman.

23:04.343 --> 23:06.345
It's Mr. Varek to you.

23:07.613 --> 23:09.011
I think you'll find the
devil never dresses down

23:09.013 --> 23:12.482
because he knows lust
lingers for eternity

23:12.484 --> 23:14.317
and envy is everywhere.

23:14.319 --> 23:16.786
Once a sinner,
always a sinner.

23:16.788 --> 23:20.022
Step into my office.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.859
There should
be a strict policy

23:22.861 --> 23:26.763
against you guys buying
these things fully loaded.

23:26.765 --> 23:29.031
It's a waste of
taxpayers' dollars.

23:29.033 --> 23:29.968
Am I right?

23:37.209 --> 23:40.143
We've got word of a
transfer down in the Gulf.

23:40.145 --> 23:42.111
Los Perros del Diablo left it

23:42.113 --> 23:46.216
and we have reason to
believe it's been collected.

23:46.218 --> 23:47.784
We just want you
saying on the record

23:47.786 --> 23:49.388
that it wasn't you.

23:50.789 --> 23:52.289
I haven't touched it.

23:52.291 --> 23:53.792
Glad to hear it.

23:55.227 --> 23:58.128
Certainly make sure you
put that on the record.

23:58.130 --> 24:00.697
Leaman, why don't you
go sniff around that limo

24:00.699 --> 24:02.632
make sure our
fashionable friend here

24:02.634 --> 24:06.002
is keeping his nose
nice and clean.

24:06.004 --> 24:07.172
Okay.

24:08.173 --> 24:09.808
There is a problem?

24:11.577 --> 24:14.544
Apart from the fact
the money's not there

24:14.546 --> 24:18.016
or the bullshit theatrics
from Los Perros?

24:19.017 --> 24:21.019
I want my money in full.

24:22.854 --> 24:25.655
Anybody that stands in
my path is dead already.

24:25.657 --> 24:27.726
They just don't know yet.

24:29.328 --> 24:31.229
Maybe you'll warn them.

24:41.273 --> 24:42.906
Hey, John.

24:42.908 --> 24:47.512
Get the fuck away from my
car unless you got a warrant.

24:49.448 --> 24:51.281
Don't worry, Zalman.

24:51.283 --> 24:55.218
Not gonna bust ya on
some bullshit charge.

24:55.220 --> 24:56.186
I'm gonna take
apart what you did

24:56.188 --> 24:58.624
to this world piece by piece.

25:00.459 --> 25:04.628
Then why the fuck are you
working with that bitch?

25:04.630 --> 25:05.629
Huh.

25:10.802 --> 25:12.769
This ain't good.

25:12.771 --> 25:14.037
Okay, seriously, Dash,

25:14.039 --> 25:15.105
we could just dump
the cash overboard

25:15.107 --> 25:16.806
to throw 'em off our tail.

25:16.808 --> 25:20.076
Oh my god, are you
seriously giving up already?

25:20.078 --> 25:22.312
Something tells me that your
average, respectable drug lord

25:22.314 --> 25:24.314
isn't gonna forgive
his cash being stolen

25:24.316 --> 25:26.316
even if it's for paid in full.

25:26.318 --> 25:27.283
No, I'm not giving up.

25:27.285 --> 25:29.052
I'm just saying we have options.

25:29.054 --> 25:30.787
Like fighting.

25:30.789 --> 25:33.056
Oh, I appreciate that your
imagination's come back, baby.

25:33.058 --> 25:33.957
I do.

25:33.959 --> 25:35.392
That's even more stupid

25:35.394 --> 25:38.662
than him wanting to
throw the cash overboard.

25:38.664 --> 25:39.998
Rosie's right.

25:56.648 --> 25:59.249
Drink up, Lemon, we've
got a long day ahead of us.

25:59.251 --> 26:00.450
Tell me you got
me out of bed early

26:00.452 --> 26:02.519
to run around after
a measly 50 mil?

26:02.521 --> 26:05.922
So you missed your spin
class. Boo fucking hoo.

26:05.924 --> 26:08.191
You can't see wood
from the trees here?

26:08.193 --> 26:09.459
This should be an easy win.

26:09.461 --> 26:10.660
Is that the case?

26:10.662 --> 26:12.095
Because we don't
have a single lead.

26:12.097 --> 26:13.296
Don't you worry about that.

26:13.298 --> 26:15.031
I've got some friends
working on it.

26:15.033 --> 26:15.867
Hm. No.

26:17.102 --> 26:20.437
I get it. You don't
like working under me.

26:20.439 --> 26:22.038
I figure that's on the
account of me being

26:22.040 --> 26:23.940
a particularly
unlikable motherfucker

26:23.942 --> 26:25.942
so that's fine.

26:25.944 --> 26:28.611
But me being a particularly
unlikable motherfucker

26:28.613 --> 26:30.714
is something I pride myself on.

26:31.850 --> 26:33.850
So how about this?

26:33.852 --> 26:35.785
You help me get this money

26:35.787 --> 26:39.389
and I help bump
you up the system.

26:39.391 --> 26:40.692
Senior Agent.

26:47.733 --> 26:49.833
All right.

26:49.835 --> 26:51.401
It's either an
injector or a filter.

26:51.403 --> 26:52.902
Can you fix it?

26:52.904 --> 26:55.538
Dude, I'm usually under
these things not inside them.

26:55.540 --> 26:56.372
Get below deck.

26:56.374 --> 26:57.407
What about you?

26:57.409 --> 26:59.678
Don't worry about me. Go.

27:38.450 --> 27:39.451
False alarm.

27:46.958 --> 27:48.091
If a piece of
shit wreck like that

27:48.093 --> 27:50.293
can catch us, anything can.

27:50.295 --> 27:53.863
I'm not gonna lie, we're
dead in the water here.

27:53.865 --> 27:56.800
Well, I guess we're
gonna need a faster boat.

27:56.802 --> 27:57.734
What about that one?

28:00.206 --> 28:01.738
Somehow, I don't
think we're gonna be able

28:01.740 --> 28:03.940
to catch up with that.

28:03.942 --> 28:05.642
Hey, Dash.

28:05.644 --> 28:06.609
Yeah.

28:06.611 --> 28:08.111
Can you handle one of those?

28:08.113 --> 28:09.047
I mean...

28:10.315 --> 28:11.150
I can.

28:16.155 --> 28:18.488
Okay, so a fat, fake
tan slob like that

28:18.490 --> 28:20.056
never misses his lunch

28:20.058 --> 28:21.324
and they're not coming
in at this time.

28:21.326 --> 28:22.826
It's going out.

28:22.828 --> 28:24.295
He's probably gonna
wanna fuck his bimbo

28:24.297 --> 28:26.230
while he's out there so,
assuming the Viagra kicks in,

28:26.232 --> 28:29.168
I'll give him an
extra two minutes.

28:30.836 --> 28:33.172
We could just about make it.

28:38.177 --> 28:39.077
Hey, Jaq.

28:40.478 --> 28:41.711
We need to talk.

28:41.713 --> 28:43.648
Bas, we need to move.

28:44.516 --> 28:45.350
Okay.

28:47.619 --> 28:49.853
That's it, Eddie,
give her a good tug.

28:49.855 --> 28:52.021
That's it. Keep pulling.

28:52.023 --> 28:53.656
Work those glutes.

28:53.658 --> 28:55.658
Ah, you have fun today, baby?

28:55.660 --> 28:57.261
Mm-hm.

28:57.263 --> 28:58.663
Come on, Eddie.

29:01.700 --> 29:02.534
Hi.

29:06.471 --> 29:08.004
You
like that, Eddie?

29:08.006 --> 29:09.973
Oh, she's a very
pretty woman, sir.

29:09.975 --> 29:11.374
Yeah, yeah, she dressed
like an idiot for a boat

29:11.376 --> 29:12.976
but I gotta tell ya,
on land, she's built

29:12.978 --> 29:14.577
like the Mona Lisa, right?

29:14.579 --> 29:15.879
Whatever
you say, sir.

29:15.881 --> 29:16.980
Unbelievable.

29:16.982 --> 29:18.982
Hey, here are the keys.

29:18.984 --> 29:21.050
Don't scratch it today and maybe
you'll get a tip this time.

29:21.052 --> 29:22.018
How's that, huh?

29:22.020 --> 29:23.386
- Okay, okay?
- Okay, okay.

29:23.388 --> 29:24.721
- Huh, huh, yeah, like that?
- Sounds good, okay.

29:24.723 --> 29:26.890
Okay, nightie night, kid.

29:26.892 --> 29:30.361
I love this kid.

29:53.018 --> 29:54.351
I just wish you'd
say it, you know.

29:54.353 --> 29:55.852
Say what?

29:55.854 --> 29:58.488
That I'm good
enough for a one-night stand

29:58.490 --> 29:59.722
and that's it.

29:59.724 --> 30:00.590
You had fun the
other night, right?

30:00.592 --> 30:01.424
Yeah.

30:01.426 --> 30:02.592
So what's the problem?

30:02.594 --> 30:04.093
As shocking
as it may seem,

30:04.095 --> 30:07.497
some guys care about more
than just casual sex.

30:07.499 --> 30:08.332
You're so fucking sensitive.

30:08.334 --> 30:09.266
That's a good thing.

30:09.268 --> 30:10.566
- Is it?
- Yeah.

30:10.568 --> 30:13.036
I'll be with you
guys in a minute.

30:13.038 --> 30:14.103
Look, you keep saying

30:14.105 --> 30:15.905
that we're fundamentally
incompatible,

30:15.907 --> 30:19.609
but the more I see, the
more I think you're wrong.

30:19.611 --> 30:20.910
- Here.
- Oh uh.

30:20.912 --> 30:22.346
Hey.

30:22.348 --> 30:23.680
Hey, you can't do that, man.

30:23.682 --> 30:26.216
I can't fucking deal
with this right now.

30:30.423 --> 30:31.756
Get the front.

30:40.465 --> 30:41.931
Yes!

30:41.933 --> 30:43.402
Oh, that's badass.

30:44.803 --> 30:46.469
Oh, here we go.

30:46.471 --> 30:47.306
Ah, god.

30:48.907 --> 30:50.207
All right.

30:50.209 --> 30:51.641
Hey, what'd you
do with the yacht?

30:51.643 --> 30:52.642
Oh, don't worry, brother,
she's still floating.

30:52.644 --> 30:53.912
Works for me.

30:55.448 --> 30:57.580
Comin' over, I'm comin' over.

30:57.582 --> 30:58.384
Yeah.

31:01.886 --> 31:02.721
All right.

31:05.056 --> 31:07.924
Um, guys.

31:07.926 --> 31:08.760
Ho ho ho.

31:09.928 --> 31:12.895
What is up with boat
owners and guns, dude?

31:12.897 --> 31:14.398
Put that down now.

31:14.400 --> 31:18.302
Baby, I don't even know how
to use this thing. Come on.

31:22.141 --> 31:23.673
Now you do.

31:23.675 --> 31:25.342
Oh fuck, yeah I do.

31:25.344 --> 31:26.178
Yeah I do!

31:27.012 --> 31:28.811
Woo!

31:28.813 --> 31:29.979
Holy shit!

31:29.981 --> 31:32.249
Oh, man, I fucking
love this boat already.

31:32.251 --> 31:33.082
Yes!

31:33.084 --> 31:33.916
Okay.

31:33.918 --> 31:35.118
Okay, okay.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.353
Oh wow.

31:36.355 --> 31:37.587
- Hey, get the line.
- Okay, you're fine.

31:37.589 --> 31:38.988
All right, I'll
get you back later.

31:38.990 --> 31:39.922
- You know how that is.
- You better.

31:39.924 --> 31:40.823
All right, clear?

31:40.825 --> 31:43.593
Yeah!

31:43.595 --> 31:44.660
Get moving.

31:49.801 --> 31:50.668
- Woo!
- Yeah!

31:54.672 --> 31:55.972
It's been two hours.

31:55.974 --> 31:57.540
They sure these guys
are headed north?

31:57.542 --> 31:58.875
Just had it confirmed.

31:58.877 --> 32:00.109
And get this.

32:00.111 --> 32:01.811
We got a name on
the boat they took.

32:01.813 --> 32:03.046
Fair Warning.

32:03.048 --> 32:04.381
That's fucking irony, man.

32:04.383 --> 32:05.349
Right?

32:05.351 --> 32:06.716
They have to tuck in here

32:06.718 --> 32:08.051
and all we need from that video

32:08.053 --> 32:09.886
to prove that a
firearm was involved

32:09.888 --> 32:11.854
once we've seized everything,

32:11.856 --> 32:14.291
got them in cuffs, and
made the money disappear,

32:14.293 --> 32:18.561
we turn them over to ATF
for suspected gun smuggling.

32:18.563 --> 32:19.396
This is almost too easy.

32:19.398 --> 32:20.899
What am I missing?

32:22.501 --> 32:26.069
That putting 'em behind bars
isn't exactly making amends.

32:26.071 --> 32:30.673
As long as they're out of my
hair, I couldn't give a damn.

32:30.675 --> 32:32.242
If you want your
precious retribution,

32:32.244 --> 32:34.178
hand them over to
Zalman with his cut.

32:51.029 --> 32:51.996
Take a look.

32:56.668 --> 32:58.502
You think?

32:58.504 --> 33:00.670
Seems a little casual.

33:00.672 --> 33:01.407
It does.

33:10.282 --> 33:11.716
How 'bout that.

33:15.920 --> 33:16.853
Go!

33:16.855 --> 33:17.954
- Turn, turn!
- What?

33:17.956 --> 33:18.788
Get us out of here.

33:18.790 --> 33:20.022
Oh my god!

33:20.024 --> 33:23.795
What's going on?

33:25.564 --> 33:26.430
I'll call a helicopter.

33:26.432 --> 33:27.730
No.

33:27.732 --> 33:29.632
We don't have any
friends in the sky.

33:29.634 --> 33:30.700
Let them enjoy the ride.

33:30.702 --> 33:32.635
It's between them and us now.

33:37.942 --> 33:40.977
Just head north,
follow the shoreline.

33:40.979 --> 33:43.982
You wanna tell
me what's going on?

33:47.819 --> 33:48.653
Fuck!

34:03.602 --> 34:04.901
I'm still working
on getting the names

34:04.903 --> 34:07.970
but that's what I've got so far.

34:07.972 --> 34:10.072
Dock worker took it
with his cell phone.

34:10.074 --> 34:11.508
It's gone viral already.

34:11.510 --> 34:12.742
Can't say I'm too surprised.

34:12.744 --> 34:14.278
I fucking love
this boat already.

34:14.280 --> 34:15.111
Yes!

34:15.113 --> 34:15.947
Okay.

34:22.921 --> 34:25.255
I've got something
to show you.

34:25.257 --> 34:28.927
Turns out we're not
dealing with an amateur.

34:33.132 --> 34:36.366
Keep a lookout for a
vehicle, something big.

34:36.368 --> 34:38.635
We have to make
the transfer fast.

34:38.637 --> 34:40.170
You can do this, okay?

34:40.172 --> 34:41.103
You back up the truck.

34:41.105 --> 34:42.606
I backed up the truck.

34:42.608 --> 34:44.608
Truck's over there. I need
it over here by the boat.

34:44.610 --> 34:45.509
I don't get it.

34:47.712 --> 34:49.479
Okay, you win,
it's really easy.

34:49.481 --> 34:50.547
Do the math.

34:50.549 --> 34:51.814
Great.

34:51.816 --> 34:53.049
But just move it
over to the right.

34:53.051 --> 34:55.219
Okay.

34:55.221 --> 34:57.287
Hey, slow it down!

34:57.289 --> 34:58.888
You're gonna hurt somebody.

34:58.890 --> 35:00.190
Slow it down.

35:00.192 --> 35:01.057
- Hey, get outta here!
- What is going on?

35:01.059 --> 35:02.959
Get outta here.

35:02.961 --> 35:03.793
Hey!

35:04.630 --> 35:06.663
Oh my god!

35:06.665 --> 35:08.198
Hey get outta
here, get outta here!

35:08.200 --> 35:10.200
Oh, my god.

35:10.202 --> 35:12.868
Oh!

35:19.545 --> 35:21.712
Oh my god, that's my truck.

35:21.714 --> 35:23.382
They took our truck!

35:27.051 --> 35:29.752
What the hell just happened?

35:29.754 --> 35:31.423
Woo, ha ha ha hoo!

35:32.324 --> 35:33.158
Holy shit!

35:39.030 --> 35:41.531
You guys, hold
on, hold on tight.

35:41.533 --> 35:43.734
We're going for a ride, baby.

35:43.736 --> 35:44.936
Hoo we're rich.

35:45.903 --> 35:46.904
Hoo hoo hoo!

35:50.609 --> 35:52.544
Guys, hang on, hang on.

35:53.612 --> 35:55.612
Hold on tight, hold on tight.

35:55.614 --> 35:57.549
Do not lose that money.

36:04.789 --> 36:06.223
Woo!

36:06.225 --> 36:09.126
I fucking love this truck!

36:09.128 --> 36:10.727
You guys, we did it.

36:10.729 --> 36:14.631
Oh, we did it.

36:14.633 --> 36:15.800
Oh, we did it.

36:17.269 --> 36:18.102
We did it.

36:19.705 --> 36:21.871
Oh, we fucking did it.

36:21.873 --> 36:24.708
4-4-30-20

36:26.578 --> 36:27.711
Anything?

36:27.713 --> 36:28.745
Nothin' yet.

36:28.747 --> 36:31.317
We're still gathering evidence.

36:32.817 --> 36:36.420
You know, maybe I'm wrong,
but this seems personal to you.

36:38.557 --> 36:42.726
All right,
what's the protocol then?

36:42.728 --> 36:45.331
Like you said, it's personal.

36:46.831 --> 36:47.666
Come on.

36:50.336 --> 36:52.902
My god, I love this
truck.

36:52.904 --> 36:55.639
It's got my air, it's
got my cruise control.

36:55.641 --> 36:56.807
Ah, I'm sitting in what feels

36:56.809 --> 36:58.575
like a goddamn
La-Z-Boy right now.

36:59.511 --> 37:00.777
The truck's stolen, dude.

37:00.779 --> 37:03.280
I wanna get back the
money that we dropped.

37:03.282 --> 37:04.581
And since I can't
keep this truck,

37:04.583 --> 37:06.516
I wanna get one of my own.

37:06.518 --> 37:07.484
Dash.

37:07.486 --> 37:09.186
I'm gonna name my truck Buck.

37:09.188 --> 37:10.821
Okay, Dash, listen.

37:10.823 --> 37:12.422
I'm gonna get the
full care package,

37:12.424 --> 37:14.358
no expense spared.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.326
Ah, 'cause nothing's
too good for Buck.

37:16.328 --> 37:17.160
Dash.

37:17.162 --> 37:18.094
What?

37:18.096 --> 37:19.429
We're not going back, okay?

37:19.431 --> 37:21.864
Jaquer, it's
millions of dollars!

37:21.866 --> 37:23.133
I don't mean to be
out of line right now

37:23.135 --> 37:24.768
but, I mean, do you
even have a plan?

37:24.770 --> 37:27.036
We don't need a plan. We
need a strategy and right now.

37:27.038 --> 37:29.373
So keep it cool, lay low,

37:29.375 --> 37:31.974
and find the shadiest
salvage yard in town, okay?

37:31.976 --> 37:35.312
You'll get another
truck... named Buck!

37:35.314 --> 37:36.879
Fine.

37:36.881 --> 37:37.716
Fine.

37:38.883 --> 37:39.882
Guys.

37:39.884 --> 37:40.717
What?

37:40.719 --> 37:41.551
Stop.

37:41.553 --> 37:42.719
Fine.

37:42.721 --> 37:43.886
You make me nervous.

37:43.888 --> 37:44.855
- Stop.
- Shush!

37:58.370 --> 38:00.303
Hey, man, we were hoping
maybe you could help us

38:00.305 --> 38:02.408
make this truck disappear.

38:04.376 --> 38:06.576
Yeah, he's nice.

38:06.578 --> 38:08.480
Yeah, let's go.

38:12.217 --> 38:14.049
What's in the packages?

38:14.051 --> 38:17.254
We're taking Bibles
up to Sacramento.

38:20.925 --> 38:22.161
It's a crusade.

38:26.931 --> 38:28.498
No title?

38:28.500 --> 38:29.334
No.

38:30.502 --> 38:32.671
But it's an $80,000 truck.

38:34.071 --> 38:35.205
You desperados maybe have

38:35.207 --> 38:37.874
more better luck on Craigslist.

39:02.534 --> 39:05.802
Are you prepared to
do that with yourself?

39:05.804 --> 39:09.208
Mm-hm.

39:11.477 --> 39:15.046
Good luck putting
yourself back together.

39:18.784 --> 39:20.652
Just you. Come with me.

39:29.428 --> 39:33.263
Hey, uh, Jaq, pick
something nice, yeah?

39:45.577 --> 39:49.980
You know, this air con
is all con and no air.

39:52.317 --> 39:54.351
Uh, Jaq, that was our exit.

39:54.353 --> 39:56.018
No, it wasn't.

39:56.020 --> 39:57.420
But we're still heading north.

39:57.422 --> 39:59.756
"In
strategy, the longest way around

39:59.758 --> 40:02.425
is often the shortest way home."

40:02.427 --> 40:04.828
Is that James
Joyce, the novelist?

40:04.830 --> 40:09.699
No. Liddell
Hart, the military strategist.

40:09.701 --> 40:12.435
We are indeed from
different worlds.

40:12.437 --> 40:14.671
"You think you're escaping
and run into yourself.

40:14.673 --> 40:18.040
Sometimes the longest way around
is the shortest way home."

40:18.042 --> 40:19.943
Different worlds, yeah.

40:19.945 --> 40:22.212
Eventually, everything joins up.

40:22.214 --> 40:24.950
The question is,
are you escaping

40:25.951 --> 40:28.218
or running into yourself?

40:28.220 --> 40:30.554
Hey, guys, if we're
taking the long way

40:30.556 --> 40:34.324
back to LA, does this make
it an official road trip?

40:35.961 --> 40:37.059
Yeah?

40:37.061 --> 40:38.228
- Yeah?
- Yes, Dash.

40:38.230 --> 40:39.663
- This is a road trip.
- Road trip?

40:39.665 --> 40:40.964
- Yes.
- Okay!

40:40.966 --> 40:42.299
Woo, road trip!

41:21.373 --> 41:22.772
No.

41:22.774 --> 41:25.742
You make this mistake, I
checkmate you in just two moves.

41:25.744 --> 41:26.876
Even though I'm a step behind,

41:26.878 --> 41:28.612
you cannot defeat me.

41:28.614 --> 41:30.614
War is about starting
with the right moves

41:30.616 --> 41:32.114
not about hoping
that the tide turns

41:32.116 --> 41:35.352
at the last minute
and you get lucky.

41:35.354 --> 41:37.189
Okay, so now you play.

41:42.126 --> 41:43.560
Ah, just when you thought
it couldn't get any better.

41:47.899 --> 41:50.133
I should arrest you
hooligans for loitering.

41:50.135 --> 41:53.870
You could try, but
we're not kids anymore.

41:53.872 --> 41:55.472
Yeah, some of you are fathers

41:55.474 --> 41:57.974
and should start acting like it.

41:57.976 --> 42:00.443
Now, tell me where to look
for your fucking daughter.

42:00.445 --> 42:04.814
Oh, you know, if I
knew, I'd never tell you.

42:04.816 --> 42:06.549
But if I knew, I'd
be there already.

42:07.986 --> 42:09.421
Put an APB out.

42:10.555 --> 42:11.390
Hey.

42:12.491 --> 42:14.824
You don't need to do this.

42:14.826 --> 42:17.661
She's your fucking daughter too.

42:17.663 --> 42:19.429
Don't remind me.

42:38.283 --> 42:39.449
All right, baby, you can't eat

42:39.451 --> 42:41.351
your own body weight
in crap, okay?

42:41.353 --> 42:43.588
I can and I will.

43:14.519 --> 43:16.720
Keep the change.

43:16.722 --> 43:18.155
Hey, we still gotta get gas.

43:18.157 --> 43:19.658
There's no time.

43:25.897 --> 43:28.398
Here take us into
the back roads.

43:28.400 --> 43:29.532
It's gonna add hours.

43:29.534 --> 43:31.135
Oh no, I forgot to pee.

43:31.137 --> 43:32.169
Oh god.

43:32.171 --> 43:35.172
Listen, my mom is with the DEA

43:35.174 --> 43:36.539
and my dad is one of
the biggest crime lords

43:36.541 --> 43:37.974
this side of the border.

43:37.976 --> 43:39.476
I'm pretty sure what
we stole is theirs

43:39.478 --> 43:41.544
and I know they'll stop
at nothing to get it back

43:41.546 --> 43:43.079
so I don't wanna
hear are we there yet

43:43.081 --> 43:44.581
or can we stop for a pee break

43:44.583 --> 43:46.516
'cause right now we have
two gangs hunting us down

43:46.518 --> 43:49.521
and I don't know
which one is worse.

43:51.757 --> 43:53.256
Gotta pee.

43:53.258 --> 43:54.657
Told you I was weird.

44:03.268 --> 44:04.501
Good.

44:04.503 --> 44:07.771
Got 'em. Headin'
north on the 126.

44:07.773 --> 44:08.938
Copy that.

44:08.940 --> 44:10.942
Just like you thought.

44:12.110 --> 44:14.711
I see the doubt in
your eyes, Leaman.

44:14.713 --> 44:16.112
Don't fall into
the trap thinking

44:16.114 --> 44:17.614
you can just walk away.

44:17.616 --> 44:21.785
You're just as much a part
of it as the rest of us.

44:21.787 --> 44:25.123
That why you're suddenly
calling me by my real name?

44:34.699 --> 44:36.699
What was that?

44:36.701 --> 44:38.568
Jaq, we need gas bad.

44:38.570 --> 44:40.737
You coulda
give us a heads up, Jaq.

44:40.739 --> 44:41.571
I'm telling you,

44:41.573 --> 44:42.539
it's the curse.

44:42.541 --> 44:43.940
We betrayed the Santa Muerte.

44:43.942 --> 44:45.108
Oh my god.

44:45.110 --> 44:46.476
Are you gonna blame her too

44:46.478 --> 44:47.911
when you blow through
all of our money

44:47.913 --> 44:49.312
in your orgy of
self-destruction?

44:49.314 --> 44:51.314
Why are you being so
protective over money

44:51.316 --> 44:52.482
you don't even have yet?

44:52.484 --> 44:54.617
I just want my
10 mil, that's all.

44:54.619 --> 44:56.486
You're not getting 10
mil. You're getting five.

44:56.488 --> 44:57.654
Oh!

44:57.656 --> 44:59.656
The cleaning rate
is 50% at least.

44:59.658 --> 45:01.324
Okay, I am one bombshell
away from walking away

45:01.326 --> 45:02.826
from you guys.

45:02.828 --> 45:06.930
Is there any other big news
that you need to tell us, Jaq?

45:06.932 --> 45:08.631
Look, I'm gonna
pull over for the night.

45:09.801 --> 45:12.637
You guys need to
just chill out, okay?

45:23.949 --> 45:26.349
Oh well, I'm feeling
pretty exposed right now.

45:26.351 --> 45:29.953
Well, sometimes it's
empowering to feel vulnerable.

45:29.955 --> 45:30.854
Well, not
when you're carrying

45:30.856 --> 45:32.689
around $50 million it ain't.

45:33.925 --> 45:35.358
Nice to
know your priorities.

45:35.360 --> 45:36.359
Just not in the
same way you're willing

45:36.361 --> 45:38.195
to wanna self-destruct.

45:38.197 --> 45:39.196
Well, maybe that's
what we have to do

45:39.198 --> 45:41.030
to start to rebuild.

45:41.032 --> 45:42.365
You are who you are.

45:42.367 --> 45:43.200
Shh.

45:45.770 --> 45:47.103
Do you hear that?

45:47.105 --> 45:48.174
Yeah, I do.

45:49.308 --> 45:50.542
Yeah, me too.

45:51.443 --> 45:52.675
- You too?
- Jaq?

45:52.677 --> 45:54.446
What do you
mean? You too?

45:55.547 --> 45:56.882
Wait, are you...

45:57.782 --> 45:58.982
Are you guys serious?

45:58.984 --> 46:01.185
You're just gonna leave?

46:01.187 --> 46:02.118
Oh, you know what?

46:02.120 --> 46:03.386
Yeah, knock your socks off.

46:03.388 --> 46:04.687
I'll just stay here
and watch our money.

46:06.158 --> 46:07.724
Come on, man.

46:07.726 --> 46:09.525
Gimme the keys.

46:09.527 --> 46:11.961
No.

46:11.963 --> 46:14.300
Uh, Jaq, give me the keys.

46:15.467 --> 46:16.666
What do you think
I'm gonna leave?

46:21.840 --> 46:22.572
Thank you.

46:22.574 --> 46:23.873
I trust you.

46:29.581 --> 46:30.780
Laughing now.

46:47.065 --> 46:48.598
What's the next one?

46:52.405 --> 46:53.770
You guys all right?

46:53.772 --> 46:55.272
Yeah, we just pulled
up for the night

46:55.274 --> 46:56.539
and we were wondering

46:56.541 --> 46:58.508
if we could come get
warm with you guys.

47:00.745 --> 47:01.911
- Here you go.
- Come get warm.

47:01.913 --> 47:02.845
Come on.

47:05.016 --> 47:06.252
Come.

47:08.220 --> 47:09.186
Welcome.

47:09.188 --> 47:10.119
Thank you.

47:10.121 --> 47:13.190
So do you live in that van?

47:13.192 --> 47:14.125
That van?

47:15.394 --> 47:18.094
Yeah, you could say
something like that.

47:18.096 --> 47:20.266
And you two in that van?

47:21.300 --> 47:23.400
Well, it turns out

47:23.402 --> 47:26.305
that three is not
a crowd actually.

47:34.079 --> 47:35.912
Now, don't you
kids go thinking

47:35.914 --> 47:37.348
you invented that.

47:37.350 --> 47:40.817
We were in fucking orgies
before you were potential stains

47:40.819 --> 47:42.219
on the wall.

47:42.221 --> 47:43.454
Oh, come on now, Molly.

47:43.456 --> 47:44.654
It's true.

47:44.656 --> 47:46.156
Yes, it is.

47:46.158 --> 47:48.158
Well, I think I wanna
live in a van too.

47:48.160 --> 47:50.427
Everybody thinks
to escape reality,

47:50.429 --> 47:51.494
you have to be rich.

47:51.496 --> 47:52.495
Bullshit.

47:52.497 --> 47:54.298
You gotta get dirt poor first

47:54.300 --> 47:56.166
and then you grow
out from there.

47:56.168 --> 47:57.434
Wow.

47:57.436 --> 47:59.470
Couldn't have said
it better myself.

47:59.472 --> 48:00.404
Here you go.

48:00.406 --> 48:01.504
Oh, thank you.

48:01.506 --> 48:03.006
Really?

48:03.008 --> 48:04.408
That's funny, because when
I said the exact same thing,

48:04.410 --> 48:07.344
you acted like I was crazy.

48:08.481 --> 48:09.313
Hm.

48:09.315 --> 48:10.280
Thanks for the beer.

48:12.017 --> 48:13.983
Enjoy.

48:13.985 --> 48:15.118
Jaq.

48:15.120 --> 48:16.853
Oh, let her brood, honey.

48:16.855 --> 48:19.189
If I can go five years
cooped up in a van

48:19.191 --> 48:22.859
with this asshole, you can
survive one night without her.

48:23.828 --> 48:25.028
Well, she's right, you know.

48:25.030 --> 48:26.996
Hit is, maestro.

48:43.581 --> 48:44.549
I got you.

48:50.222 --> 48:51.056
Got you.

48:52.557 --> 48:54.458
- Beat it, nerd.
- Oh!

48:55.494 --> 48:57.227
Jaq. You can't do that.

48:57.229 --> 48:58.995
You scared the shit outta me.

48:58.997 --> 49:00.897
Off the hood.

49:00.899 --> 49:03.133
Betsy needs some love.

49:04.336 --> 49:06.736
Did you find a
7-Eleven down there?

49:06.738 --> 49:09.806
Oh no, just free love
and payment in kind.

49:09.808 --> 49:10.840
Oh.

49:10.842 --> 49:12.409
Well, proud to be penniless

49:12.411 --> 49:14.744
until opportunity knocks.

49:14.746 --> 49:15.747
All right.

49:22.254 --> 49:24.087
All right, girl.

49:24.089 --> 49:24.989
Talk to me.

49:28.059 --> 49:30.260
Why do you keep such
a big part of your life

49:30.262 --> 49:31.397
from me, Jaq?

49:35.568 --> 49:38.670
People just don't
fit well with it.

49:56.422 --> 49:59.021
So what does that
mean about the future?

50:01.126 --> 50:04.794
I mean, now that we
actually have one.

50:04.796 --> 50:06.298
What does it mean?

50:09.868 --> 50:11.102
You built a box

50:12.937 --> 50:15.439
so tight around yourself

50:15.441 --> 50:17.108
only you can fit in.

50:20.979 --> 50:22.581
That's what you do.

50:24.617 --> 50:27.620
Sometimes that's
just how it goes.

50:35.327 --> 50:37.059
That's how it goes.

50:53.011 --> 50:54.977
Still a
night owl I see.

50:54.979 --> 50:56.012
Crowe?

50:56.014 --> 50:58.215
Is that sweet voice Crowe?

50:58.217 --> 51:00.352
It is! It is my sweet Crowe

51:01.353 --> 51:02.854
and Leaman, right?

51:04.256 --> 51:06.590
Hey, Lance, I wanna
play in your toy box.

51:06.592 --> 51:07.823
You do?

51:07.825 --> 51:10.194
Oh, I've been
waiting my whole life

51:10.196 --> 51:13.029
for you to ask me
that.

51:13.031 --> 51:14.533
I wasn't asking.

51:16.335 --> 51:17.700
Even better.

51:17.702 --> 51:20.870
And, Leaman, relax, calm down.

51:20.872 --> 51:22.372
You need to meditate.

51:22.374 --> 51:24.006
Ohm.

51:24.008 --> 51:25.275
Geez.

51:25.277 --> 51:27.477
Nice little
setup you got here.

51:27.479 --> 51:30.547
Word on the street is
you collect cars now.

51:30.549 --> 51:32.316
You gone soft on me?

51:32.318 --> 51:33.883
Well, as you can see,

51:33.885 --> 51:35.952
I'm still very much
open for business.

51:35.954 --> 51:39.456
And, yeah, I may have
acquired a modest collection

51:39.458 --> 51:40.723
to help me pass the time.

51:40.725 --> 51:44.697
Think fast!

51:46.030 --> 51:48.632
Ha!

51:48.634 --> 51:49.832
I think I might have

51:49.834 --> 51:51.869
an addictive personality.

51:53.071 --> 51:55.740
Nothing quite hides any new evil

51:57.142 --> 51:59.245
like a beautiful exterior.

52:04.849 --> 52:07.049
Nice to see you packing
even a little heat.

52:07.051 --> 52:08.352
Mm.

52:08.354 --> 52:09.586
Are these registered?

52:09.588 --> 52:14.324
Registered, inspected,
and fully street legal.

52:14.326 --> 52:15.758
- I'm talking about the guns.
- Hey, fellas,

52:15.760 --> 52:17.927
take a look around,
do me a favor.

52:17.929 --> 52:20.497
I've forgotten what I've
gotten hidden where.

52:20.499 --> 52:21.331
And you?

52:22.601 --> 52:24.767
My conscience is clear.

52:24.769 --> 52:26.104
How 'bout yours?

52:28.106 --> 52:31.510
So how come you come
knocking on my door?

52:33.778 --> 52:36.713
Zalman's guns not big enough?

52:36.715 --> 52:38.749
Just didn't wanna give
him the satisfaction

52:38.751 --> 52:40.950
of being the only reason
to win this battle.

52:40.952 --> 52:45.054
Nothing
fights quite like family.

52:45.056 --> 52:49.127
How 'bout you come back
and make one you deserve?

52:50.129 --> 52:51.628
Where is the arsenal?

52:51.630 --> 52:53.196
Huh?

52:53.198 --> 52:54.531
Somewhere.

52:54.533 --> 52:56.067
Uh, fellas, I swear

52:57.469 --> 52:59.070
I remember an AMG-2

53:00.739 --> 53:02.408
in, in, in, the Merc.

53:04.576 --> 53:06.143
Yeah.

53:06.145 --> 53:10.647
Merry Christmas.

53:12.217 --> 53:13.051
Eris.

53:15.220 --> 53:17.222
When it's you, just you,

53:19.425 --> 53:22.159
come make it you and me.

53:25.597 --> 53:28.831
Hey, hey, it's not
a toy. It's a gun.

53:28.833 --> 53:31.136
You understand? It's a gun.

53:32.571 --> 53:34.671
I tell ya something, it's
like working with kids.

53:45.850 --> 53:48.587
Woo.

53:51.490 --> 53:52.990
What's the matter?

53:54.159 --> 53:55.991
You're acting
out of character.

53:55.993 --> 53:57.127
What would Dash think?

53:57.129 --> 53:59.162
Well, ain't you heard?

53:59.164 --> 54:02.098
I ain't got no
character anymore.

54:02.100 --> 54:04.501
Maybe you're refusing
to accept your character

54:04.503 --> 54:08.171
'cause then you'd have to
accept who you really are.

54:08.173 --> 54:09.806
Well, maybe you're
refusing to accept

54:09.808 --> 54:12.542
your own character
because it means accepting

54:12.544 --> 54:16.981
you're not right
for Jaq.

54:32.297 --> 54:34.865
Great, I finally find a nice
spot to pee and you're here.

54:34.867 --> 54:36.366
Sorry, I'll go.

54:36.368 --> 54:39.902
You really like him
but you wish you didn't.

54:39.904 --> 54:44.909
Here, give a
decrepit old lady a hand.

54:54.319 --> 54:55.154
Oh, oh.

54:56.755 --> 54:58.257
Oh, you feel that?

54:59.425 --> 55:00.259
Spiritual.

55:03.395 --> 55:06.061
No.

55:06.063 --> 55:07.499
That's a problem.

55:08.434 --> 55:11.234
Keep trying to open myself up

55:11.236 --> 55:14.504
and it just pushes me
further inside my head.

55:14.506 --> 55:17.072
Maybe that's where
you need to go.

55:17.074 --> 55:19.843
The place that reminds you
just how toxic you are,

55:19.845 --> 55:22.279
that you can't be put right?

55:22.281 --> 55:25.715
Some of us contain an energy

55:25.717 --> 55:29.118
that just wants to
set the world on fire.

55:29.120 --> 55:32.923
Sometimes it flickers,
sometimes it rages,

55:32.925 --> 55:35.958
and sometimes it
flares up and ignites

55:35.960 --> 55:37.463
all that's around.

55:41.433 --> 55:43.633
And burns those
who get too close.

55:43.635 --> 55:45.602
Oh, it ain't pretty.

55:45.604 --> 55:48.540
Yeah, that's
progress, that's life.

55:51.108 --> 55:54.111
You're not toxic.
You're incendiary.

55:55.314 --> 55:58.181
And you don't need
to be put right.

55:58.183 --> 56:00.452
You need the right purpose.

56:11.996 --> 56:15.332
You never learned
not to touch?

56:15.334 --> 56:19.905
You know, most people think
she's like that, a classic.

56:21.340 --> 56:24.407
But what she really is
is a machine like that.

56:24.409 --> 56:26.510
She's spits flames.

56:26.512 --> 56:28.077
She's somebody who's
spent her whole life

56:28.079 --> 56:33.084
looking for saints but all
she ever found were sinners.

56:33.452 --> 56:36.085
You're just a speed
bump for her, man.

56:44.363 --> 56:46.865
You're just a speed bump, man.

57:00.512 --> 57:01.545
Dash.

57:01.547 --> 57:02.512
Hm?

57:02.514 --> 57:05.382
Ooh, did we get robbed?

57:08.520 --> 57:09.452
Come on.

57:15.794 --> 57:17.296
No, it's all here.

57:18.830 --> 57:20.064
What is that?

57:23.067 --> 57:23.902
- Oh.
- Ah.

57:27.839 --> 57:29.172
You're a slowpoke.

57:29.174 --> 57:30.175
I'm going.

57:33.579 --> 57:34.811
Ooh.

57:34.813 --> 57:36.646
There you
go. I want an apple.

57:36.648 --> 57:37.914
Rosie.

57:37.916 --> 57:39.916
You got an apple?

57:39.918 --> 57:41.751
- That's it.
- Nice.

57:41.753 --> 57:42.588
Yes.

57:43.655 --> 57:44.487
All right.

57:44.489 --> 57:45.355
I'm sorry, buddy.

57:45.357 --> 57:47.025
Nope, that's okay.

57:51.930 --> 57:53.029
If you're gonna
throw it at me.

57:53.031 --> 57:54.098
Nice, nice.

58:35.874 --> 58:38.310
I wanna drive next.

58:39.244 --> 58:40.577
You drive like an asshole.

58:40.579 --> 58:41.811
Look, I need to play a part.

58:41.813 --> 58:43.113
I mean, besides we're
headed back to LA.

58:43.115 --> 58:44.948
It'll help us blend in.

59:12.277 --> 59:13.777
Oh shit.

59:13.779 --> 59:15.512
All right, baby, act cool.
There's a cop behind us.

59:15.514 --> 59:16.613
You missed him.

59:16.615 --> 59:17.847
- Couldn't you have known.
- Keep going.

59:17.849 --> 59:20.183
You got this. Just
play it cool, guys.

59:20.185 --> 59:21.351
Dispatch, be advised

59:21.353 --> 59:24.020
I am currently
following a 10-29D.

59:24.022 --> 59:26.589
White Suburban
headed north on 138.

59:26.591 --> 59:28.291
Please advise.

59:28.293 --> 59:30.360
No one else gets near
them. They're mine.

59:39.705 --> 59:40.539
Shit!

59:45.544 --> 59:47.180
Go faster, Rosie.

59:54.019 --> 59:54.953
Up ahead.

1:00:09.634 --> 1:00:11.568
Oh shit, what
the fuck is that?

1:00:11.570 --> 1:00:13.405
It's my fucking mom.

1:00:14.740 --> 1:00:16.406
Faster, Rosie!

1:00:16.408 --> 1:00:17.907
I think
he's still close.

1:00:17.909 --> 1:00:20.009
Take that dirt
road, down there.

1:00:20.011 --> 1:00:21.411
Go, turn!

1:00:21.413 --> 1:00:22.645
Don't kill us.

1:00:22.647 --> 1:00:25.350
Watch it, watch it.
One, two, three.

1:00:27.753 --> 1:00:30.221
Monkey, drive straight!

1:00:30.223 --> 1:00:33.492
Why is she driving,
why is she driving?

1:00:35.260 --> 1:00:36.726
So you wanna play in the dirt.

1:00:41.234 --> 1:00:43.266
Wait go right up
here, right up here.

1:00:43.268 --> 1:00:44.934
Make a right.

1:00:44.936 --> 1:00:46.237
Go, go, go, go!

1:00:46.239 --> 1:00:48.004
Lose him!

1:00:48.006 --> 1:00:50.776
Come on, Rosie,
you can do this.

1:00:53.378 --> 1:00:54.247
Hit them.

1:00:58.884 --> 1:01:01.787
Faster, baby,
faster. You got this.

1:01:02.721 --> 1:01:03.787
Whoa.

1:01:03.789 --> 1:01:04.788
Watch it, look out.

1:01:04.790 --> 1:01:06.223
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1:01:06.225 --> 1:01:07.056
Oh God.

1:01:07.058 --> 1:01:07.893
Whoa!

1:01:08.894 --> 1:01:10.629
Baby, hit it, hit it!

1:01:11.963 --> 1:01:14.032
Don't lose them.

1:01:15.467 --> 1:01:16.601
Cut them off!

1:01:20.273 --> 1:01:21.439
Go after them.

1:01:32.417 --> 1:01:33.917
Shit, punch it!

1:01:34.886 --> 1:01:36.222
Hold on, guys.

1:01:39.457 --> 1:01:40.792
Shoot to kill.

1:01:47.332 --> 1:01:49.467
Don't tip the car, babe.

1:01:52.103 --> 1:01:54.904
Push the gas pedal! Push it!

1:01:54.906 --> 1:01:56.341
Oh, oh shit! Okay.

1:01:57.642 --> 1:01:58.443
Woo woo!

1:01:59.811 --> 1:02:02.679
Honey, I think you lost them.

1:02:02.681 --> 1:02:04.480
Keep going, no, keep going,
keep going, keep going.

1:02:04.482 --> 1:02:06.516
Hit it, hit it!

1:02:06.518 --> 1:02:08.351
Oh my, oh shit!

1:02:08.353 --> 1:02:09.621
Oh! Oh ho ho.

1:02:14.860 --> 1:02:19.030
When I say, hit those
breaks as hard as you can.

1:02:22.534 --> 1:02:23.368
Now!

1:02:37.382 --> 1:02:39.449
Hold onto this, no, no, no.

1:02:39.451 --> 1:02:40.952
You guys got it?

1:02:43.855 --> 1:02:46.359
I raised a fucking psychopath.

1:02:50.196 --> 1:02:52.629
Well, we are
certainly back in LA.

1:02:52.631 --> 1:02:55.531
Oh, I guess this is
the finish line, right?

1:02:55.533 --> 1:02:58.401
Guys, this isn't the case
of walking into a laundromat

1:02:58.403 --> 1:03:01.504
with $50 million and
walking out with clean cash.

1:03:01.506 --> 1:03:02.739
We need to walk the walk.

1:03:02.741 --> 1:03:04.540
We need to look legit.

1:03:04.542 --> 1:03:06.509
I mean, I can do this on my own

1:03:06.511 --> 1:03:09.879
but it would be a hell of
a lot easier as a team.

1:03:09.881 --> 1:03:13.917
Wait a second, did you
just ask for help, Jaq?

1:03:13.919 --> 1:03:16.686
Holy shit,
Jaquer, he's right.

1:03:16.688 --> 1:03:18.155
You did.

1:03:18.157 --> 1:03:21.090
I mean what's next, writing
poetry and painting your nails?

1:03:21.092 --> 1:03:23.360
Leave her alone.
She's growing.

1:03:23.362 --> 1:03:24.928
And she shot a
lotta people today.

1:03:24.930 --> 1:03:26.095
Mm.

1:03:26.097 --> 1:03:27.931
What's wrong with my nails?

1:03:27.933 --> 1:03:29.366
Absolutely nothing.

1:03:29.368 --> 1:03:30.869
They're perfect.

1:03:41.012 --> 1:03:42.246
Where are they?

1:03:57.095 --> 1:03:59.963
You can wave your credentials
around all you like.

1:03:59.965 --> 1:04:03.702
You know I can't let you
in without a warrant.

1:04:04.803 --> 1:04:06.303
Eris, how you been?

1:04:06.305 --> 1:04:07.937
You know how it is, right?

1:04:11.143 --> 1:04:13.412
Always hated the paperwork.

1:04:17.983 --> 1:04:18.982
- Yeah.
- But here

1:04:18.984 --> 1:04:19.882
at the beginning of the year

1:04:19.884 --> 1:04:21.452
we can see January through-

1:04:21.454 --> 1:04:24.921
- Burning the midnight
oil as always, Mortem.

1:04:24.923 --> 1:04:27.123
I like that kind of work ethic.

1:04:27.125 --> 1:04:30.960
You good for a quick
appraisal meeting?

1:04:30.962 --> 1:04:33.132
Give us a minute please.

1:04:41.573 --> 1:04:42.574
Be my guest.

1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:51.814
You expecting the
IRS or something?

1:04:51.816 --> 1:04:54.451
Well, they were the
only ones with the balls

1:04:54.453 --> 1:04:56.286
to take down Capone.

1:04:56.288 --> 1:04:57.787
You need to cancel
whatever Jacqueline

1:04:57.789 --> 1:04:59.956
may have tried to
set up with you.

1:04:59.958 --> 1:05:01.492
Jacqueline as
in your daughter?

1:05:01.494 --> 1:05:02.525
She's a fraud.

1:05:02.527 --> 1:05:04.093
I'm protecting you.

1:05:04.095 --> 1:05:05.695
Word is she's
on the up-and-up.

1:05:05.697 --> 1:05:07.096
She's just going
through a phase.

1:05:07.098 --> 1:05:08.798
She wants to be like her father.

1:05:08.800 --> 1:05:09.968
It's pathetic.

1:05:11.036 --> 1:05:13.203
Do I detect a little jealousy?

1:05:13.205 --> 1:05:17.309
Fuck no. Just a mother's
disappointment, right?

1:05:18.444 --> 1:05:19.675
Nothing's set up.

1:05:19.677 --> 1:05:21.711
Just make sure
it stays that way

1:05:21.713 --> 1:05:24.881
or this glass cell
becomes a concrete one.

1:05:24.883 --> 1:05:27.050
You've been coming to
me with your dirty laundry

1:05:27.052 --> 1:05:28.987
for nearly two decades.

1:05:30.055 --> 1:05:31.854
And you know you
can't clean shit for me

1:05:31.856 --> 1:05:33.656
if your hands are too grubby.

1:05:33.658 --> 1:05:37.227
Eris, you sat right there,
you looked me in the eye

1:05:37.229 --> 1:05:39.530
and promised immunity.

1:05:39.532 --> 1:05:40.696
We shook hands.

1:05:40.698 --> 1:05:42.799
Does a deal mean
nothing to you anymore?

1:05:42.801 --> 1:05:45.169
Stay away from Jacqueline
and I'll bring you the deal

1:05:45.171 --> 1:05:47.637
that'll mean a lot
more to both of us.

1:05:47.639 --> 1:05:49.540
50 million US dollars invested

1:05:49.542 --> 1:05:52.309
in this business relationship.

1:05:52.311 --> 1:05:54.877
Until then, you watch your lip

1:05:54.879 --> 1:05:57.550
and you call me DEA Agent Crowe.

1:06:03.755 --> 1:06:06.423
Crowe.

1:06:06.425 --> 1:06:07.259
I'm out.

1:06:08.427 --> 1:06:10.427
And I had such a
high hopes for you.

1:06:10.429 --> 1:06:11.594
You kicked me out of the loop.

1:06:11.596 --> 1:06:13.663
I can't work like
that and you know it.

1:06:13.665 --> 1:06:16.933
Well then, you're out of luck.

1:06:16.935 --> 1:06:19.702
You know we're in
a checkmate, right?

1:06:19.704 --> 1:06:20.903
And you know going up against me

1:06:20.905 --> 1:06:24.073
brings as much heat back at you.

1:06:24.075 --> 1:06:26.776
Yeah, turns out I
didn't want that promotion

1:06:26.778 --> 1:06:28.378
as much as I thought I did.

1:06:29.548 --> 1:06:30.347
We don't all have

1:06:30.349 --> 1:06:31.614
what it takes, Lemon.

1:06:31.616 --> 1:06:33.250
And don't think you
can just change back

1:06:33.252 --> 1:06:36.085
into an innocent man either.

1:06:36.087 --> 1:06:38.455
So fuck off and enjoy purgatory.

1:06:38.457 --> 1:06:43.395
You sure earned it.

1:07:17.829 --> 1:07:20.430
We're all set. Midnight.

1:07:20.432 --> 1:07:21.931
Well, what do we do till then?

1:07:21.933 --> 1:07:23.400
Well, we're
gonna make the most

1:07:23.402 --> 1:07:25.169
out of this baller ass room
is what we're gonna do.

1:07:25.171 --> 1:07:27.069
So that means you're
gonna play with everything.

1:07:27.071 --> 1:07:27.937
Look at this place.

1:07:27.939 --> 1:07:28.938
Kinda be rude not to.

1:07:30.409 --> 1:07:32.008
What we're gonna do is we're
gonna get into character.

1:07:32.010 --> 1:07:34.578
Oh, there's a mini fridge.

1:07:34.580 --> 1:07:35.845
Oh wow.

1:07:35.847 --> 1:07:37.514
50% is what we're after.

1:07:37.516 --> 1:07:39.715
To get it, we need
to put out an image

1:07:39.717 --> 1:07:42.152
that we're just in town
on regular business.

1:07:42.154 --> 1:07:43.953
They'll be keeping
a close eye on us

1:07:43.955 --> 1:07:47.157
and most likely have people
here in the hotel right now.

1:07:47.159 --> 1:07:49.593
Go take a tour around,
interact, live it up a little.

1:07:49.595 --> 1:07:50.927
Make it feel like we're
not hiding up here

1:07:50.929 --> 1:07:52.162
like a bunch of cowards.

1:07:52.164 --> 1:07:53.763
But most of all,
please stop acting

1:07:53.765 --> 1:07:58.468
like you fell off a hay
wagon from fucking Missouri!

1:07:58.470 --> 1:07:59.835
What about him?

1:07:59.837 --> 1:08:01.305
What's he doing?

1:08:01.307 --> 1:08:05.209
Every crime lord needs a
trusted bodyguard by her side.

1:08:05.211 --> 1:08:07.109
Okay.

1:08:07.111 --> 1:08:08.380
Oh, I get it.

1:08:13.152 --> 1:08:13.985
Come on.

1:09:52.718 --> 1:09:56.286
Hi, can I have a
glass of water please?

1:09:56.288 --> 1:09:57.119
Hi, baby.

1:09:57.121 --> 1:09:57.953
Hi, baby.

1:09:57.955 --> 1:09:59.291
How you doing?

1:10:00.159 --> 1:10:02.328
You spotted any spies yet?

1:10:03.462 --> 1:10:04.328
I think I have.

1:10:04.330 --> 1:10:05.562
Yeah.

1:10:05.564 --> 1:10:06.630
I'm pretty sure
grandma over there,

1:10:06.632 --> 1:10:07.464
I think she knows Kung Fu.

1:10:08.400 --> 1:10:10.066
And the old man,

1:10:10.068 --> 1:10:14.171
he's definitely buried
some hookers in his day.

1:10:15.741 --> 1:10:16.906
I know why I'm so compelled
to blow through all this money

1:10:16.908 --> 1:10:18.642
in one night

1:10:18.644 --> 1:10:23.313
and why the thought of
that scares you so much.

1:10:23.315 --> 1:10:24.483
Why is that?

1:10:25.651 --> 1:10:27.451
Because I can't begin
to picture a new life

1:10:27.453 --> 1:10:28.687
where I'm rich.

1:10:30.155 --> 1:10:34.691
And you can't bear to picture
another day where you're poor.

1:10:34.693 --> 1:10:38.829
This is just another drug
to someone like me, isn't it?

1:10:38.831 --> 1:10:41.533
No, it's the
same in all of us.

1:10:43.034 --> 1:10:47.439
We just have different ways
of coping with the addiction.

1:11:00.719 --> 1:11:02.621
It's go time.

1:13:02.073 --> 1:13:03.673
You should know I'm
not usually available

1:13:03.675 --> 1:13:05.976
on such short notice.

1:13:05.978 --> 1:13:08.445
Our usual associates
let us down.

1:13:08.447 --> 1:13:10.280
I appreciating
you reaching out.

1:13:10.282 --> 1:13:11.915
New business always interests me

1:13:11.917 --> 1:13:14.851
no matter how small it may be.

1:13:14.853 --> 1:13:16.286
Good.

1:13:16.288 --> 1:13:18.688
I always believe
in a trial period

1:13:18.690 --> 1:13:21.458
before we really get
down to business.

1:13:21.460 --> 1:13:25.464
And yet, here you are,
let down by a supplier.

1:13:27.533 --> 1:13:29.699
Do you need some water?

1:13:29.701 --> 1:13:31.368
I don't want any water
unless you're gonna use it

1:13:31.370 --> 1:13:33.539
to clean my fucking money.

1:13:35.007 --> 1:13:36.940
How come you're not in
business with your father?

1:13:36.942 --> 1:13:39.209
I do business
differently than my father.

1:13:39.211 --> 1:13:41.211
Your mother?

1:13:41.213 --> 1:13:43.179
I do everything
differently than my mother.

1:13:43.181 --> 1:13:44.881
You're a bit of a ghost.

1:13:44.883 --> 1:13:47.717
Some people tell me you've
been operating overseas.

1:13:47.719 --> 1:13:50.387
Of course, you could have
planted those seeds yourself.

1:13:50.389 --> 1:13:53.055
You could actually be in
a much weaker position.

1:13:53.057 --> 1:13:55.727
And all this could be a charade.

1:13:59.898 --> 1:14:00.864
It is a charade.

1:14:02.401 --> 1:14:06.369
I could stand here and put
on this act all night long

1:14:06.371 --> 1:14:09.908
and I had to do it to
get you in this room.

1:14:11.176 --> 1:14:13.011
If you want the truth,

1:14:14.313 --> 1:14:16.715
I'll give it to you straight.

1:14:18.517 --> 1:14:21.687
We have the better
part of $50 million

1:14:23.155 --> 1:14:25.324
right here in these cases.

1:14:26.558 --> 1:14:28.727
We found it and we took it

1:14:30.562 --> 1:14:31.828
but we can't do anything with it

1:14:31.830 --> 1:14:35.000
because it's as dirty
as money can be.

1:14:36.868 --> 1:14:39.869
Now, we came to you
hoping that you can take

1:14:39.871 --> 1:14:42.941
our $50 million and
give us 25 clean.

1:14:44.108 --> 1:14:46.776
Not so we can deal
guns or buy drugs

1:14:46.778 --> 1:14:48.614
or buy a bigger yacht.

1:14:50.248 --> 1:14:51.615
But because I wanna
give my friends

1:14:51.617 --> 1:14:53.385
a second shot at life

1:14:56.288 --> 1:14:59.291
and this is the
only way I know how.

1:15:00.459 --> 1:15:01.958
Now, I know you might
be saying this is risky

1:15:01.960 --> 1:15:05.564
and maybe this was all
a big mistake but...

1:15:08.467 --> 1:15:11.603
"Mistakes are portals
for discovery,"

1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:17.409
and I think it's
time to leap in.

1:15:19.645 --> 1:15:20.812
James Joyce.

1:15:23.281 --> 1:15:25.717
A highly unorthodox approach.

1:15:29.988 --> 1:15:32.324
Do you know what it is I do?

1:15:33.558 --> 1:15:34.993
What I really do?

1:15:36.662 --> 1:15:40.997
I clean people not money.

1:15:40.999 --> 1:15:42.067
I'm a priest.

1:15:43.168 --> 1:15:45.769
And every bill I
take is a confession.

1:15:45.771 --> 1:15:49.439
They come to me with paranoia
and leave with pride.

1:15:49.441 --> 1:15:52.108
Humility becomes arrogance.

1:15:52.110 --> 1:15:53.845
Fear becomes courage.

1:15:55.247 --> 1:15:56.680
And they don't know
that's what they're doing

1:15:56.682 --> 1:16:00.383
because their religion itself
revolves around illusion

1:16:00.385 --> 1:16:03.321
and all their friends
are followers.

1:16:04.322 --> 1:16:05.158
But you...

1:16:07.125 --> 1:16:08.293
I can't clean.

1:16:11.830 --> 1:16:14.332
So I guess you get a discount.

1:16:26.044 --> 1:16:27.711
Now, are you doing this
because you found empathy

1:16:27.713 --> 1:16:28.545
in what I said

1:16:28.547 --> 1:16:30.714
or are you doing it

1:16:30.716 --> 1:16:33.018
just to piss off my mother?

1:16:34.453 --> 1:16:39.055
This is what I like to
call a win-win situation.

1:17:08.553 --> 1:17:12.522
So that was it.

1:17:12.524 --> 1:17:15.825
It all seems a
little too easy now.

1:17:15.827 --> 1:17:17.161
We coulda at least brought
some glitter cannons,

1:17:17.163 --> 1:17:19.596
some party, celebrate, right?

1:17:19.598 --> 1:17:24.102
Is it wrong I'm feeling
far too much responsibility?

1:17:29.341 --> 1:17:34.180
Ms. Varek, there's somebody
who needs to speak with you.

1:17:38.116 --> 1:17:42.454
Follow them.

1:17:55.634 --> 1:17:59.402
If I'm not back in five
minutes, leave without me.

1:17:59.404 --> 1:18:01.306
We're not leaving you.

1:18:03.909 --> 1:18:07.544
Going our separate ways
was always part of the plan.

1:18:07.546 --> 1:18:08.380
Jaq.

1:18:10.149 --> 1:18:14.287
I just didn't think it
was gonna happen so soon.

1:18:17.322 --> 1:18:18.157
Jaq!

1:18:21.260 --> 1:18:22.091
Jaq.

1:18:22.093 --> 1:18:22.959
Oh my god.

1:18:52.858 --> 1:18:56.127
Gotcha.

1:18:59.831 --> 1:19:01.267
Is she here too?

1:19:02.868 --> 1:19:06.136
You know, some
people are so angry

1:19:06.138 --> 1:19:09.641
they're best left to
chase their own tail.

1:19:12.644 --> 1:19:14.980
My little girl all grown up.

1:19:18.550 --> 1:19:21.885
You know Jaq, I'd say you
look like a million dollars

1:19:21.887 --> 1:19:24.221
but I'd be selling you short.

1:19:24.223 --> 1:19:25.722
This isn't me.

1:19:25.724 --> 1:19:27.557
It wasn't me either.

1:19:27.559 --> 1:19:29.561
But look where I am now.

1:19:30.629 --> 1:19:33.232
I never set out to harm anyone.

1:19:36.868 --> 1:19:41.305
I just followed the path
of least resistance.

1:19:41.307 --> 1:19:44.674
Then it became all about
protecting the people I love.

1:19:44.676 --> 1:19:47.410
You know I've
never believed that.

1:19:47.412 --> 1:19:49.078
Good.

1:19:49.080 --> 1:19:50.546
I'd like to think I raised you

1:19:50.548 --> 1:19:55.185
never to take anything
anyone says at face value.

1:19:55.187 --> 1:19:56.188
Raised me.

1:19:58.657 --> 1:20:02.226
Is that what you call leaving
a child to fend for itself?

1:20:02.228 --> 1:20:06.029
I think one day
you'll understand.

1:20:06.031 --> 1:20:07.699
I only set you free.

1:20:09.201 --> 1:20:10.433
To allow you to flourish

1:20:10.435 --> 1:20:13.337
into what you were
destined to become.

1:20:13.339 --> 1:20:15.438
So are we done here?

1:20:15.440 --> 1:20:17.776
I don't know. You tell me.

1:20:19.945 --> 1:20:22.248
I want to offer you a deal.

1:20:23.848 --> 1:20:26.115
You know, you can
take that money,

1:20:26.117 --> 1:20:28.618
you can take it and run.

1:20:28.620 --> 1:20:31.288
Consider it an inheritance.

1:20:31.290 --> 1:20:33.259
And you go your own way

1:20:35.361 --> 1:20:38.094
and I will never
bother you again.

1:20:38.096 --> 1:20:42.098
But I can't say the
same for your mother.

1:20:42.100 --> 1:20:44.236
Or you hand it back to me,

1:20:46.471 --> 1:20:49.806
become my protege.

1:20:49.808 --> 1:20:52.909
I'll protect you from
her as long as you need

1:20:52.911 --> 1:20:54.144
until you become so powerful

1:20:54.146 --> 1:20:57.314
it's her who needs
protecting from you.

1:20:57.316 --> 1:20:59.082
So you can either let this
fight against the person

1:20:59.084 --> 1:21:00.453
you wish you were

1:21:02.154 --> 1:21:06.489
or use it to fuel the
person you need to be.

1:21:06.491 --> 1:21:09.161
I don't want you to walk away.

1:21:13.132 --> 1:21:15.633
I don't want you as my mentor.

1:21:18.670 --> 1:21:20.638
I want you in my corner

1:21:22.073 --> 1:21:26.511
during the bad times ready
to wrap your arms around me.

1:21:27.512 --> 1:21:30.115
I want what I've always wanted.

1:21:31.350 --> 1:21:32.817
I want my father.

1:21:53.472 --> 1:21:54.373
It's Jaq.

1:21:55.874 --> 1:22:00.146
She said to meet her at the
dealership down the street.

1:22:15.894 --> 1:22:17.229
Pop the trunk.

1:22:23.369 --> 1:22:27.538
I think there's a way we can
do this and stick together.

1:22:27.540 --> 1:22:31.674
Here.

1:22:31.676 --> 1:22:33.078
Oh shit.

1:22:37.349 --> 1:22:40.417
Okay, who is
feeling submissive.

1:22:40.419 --> 1:22:41.251
Run!

1:22:48.527 --> 1:22:49.359
Freeze!

1:22:49.361 --> 1:22:50.194
Oh!

1:23:02.774 --> 1:23:04.374
Split up, split.

1:23:04.376 --> 1:23:05.944
This way, go, go.

1:23:18.790 --> 1:23:20.257
Jaq, I've got this.

1:23:20.259 --> 1:23:21.260
It's fake.

1:23:22.194 --> 1:23:23.260
What?

1:23:23.262 --> 1:23:24.627
Use yours then.

1:23:24.629 --> 1:23:25.728
Also fake.

1:23:25.730 --> 1:23:26.963
It's all fake.

1:23:26.965 --> 1:23:27.897
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1:23:27.899 --> 1:23:29.098
Why would you give us fake guns?

1:23:29.100 --> 1:23:30.099
Now's not the
time. Get rid of it.

1:23:30.101 --> 1:23:32.136
- Put it down.
- Oh!

1:23:32.138 --> 1:23:32.969
Jaq.

1:23:32.971 --> 1:23:33.803
Over here.

1:23:33.805 --> 1:23:35.305
This way, come on.

1:23:35.307 --> 1:23:36.240
Let's go.

1:23:36.242 --> 1:23:37.274
All right.

1:23:37.276 --> 1:23:39.145
Hurry up.

1:23:42.113 --> 1:23:42.947
Come on.

1:23:45.717 --> 1:23:46.552
Go.

1:23:53.992 --> 1:23:58.997
Down to the right.

1:24:53.185 --> 1:24:54.050
Oh shit.

1:24:57.389 --> 1:25:01.225
Always sucks to fall
at the last hurdle.

1:25:01.227 --> 1:25:02.725
Mom.

1:25:02.727 --> 1:25:05.127
You know I don't like
you calling me that.

1:25:05.129 --> 1:25:07.497
This is your mother?

1:25:07.499 --> 1:25:09.065
Why are you even here?

1:25:09.067 --> 1:25:11.401
Just admit it, you
only want me around

1:25:11.403 --> 1:25:13.472
so you can fuck with Dad.

1:25:14.906 --> 1:25:17.641
I guess the jig is up.

1:25:17.643 --> 1:25:19.008
But here's the thing.

1:25:19.010 --> 1:25:21.077
I don't see him
protecting you right now.

1:25:21.079 --> 1:25:22.579
Either you hand the money over

1:25:22.581 --> 1:25:25.549
or what's going to transpire
is your motley crew here

1:25:25.551 --> 1:25:28.117
will be sadly killed
during this pursuit.

1:25:31.724 --> 1:25:32.922
Oh my god.

1:25:32.924 --> 1:25:34.157
There goes one.

1:25:34.159 --> 1:25:38.430
I can't take it.

1:25:42.033 --> 1:25:45.669
Wow, you finally
let someone in.

1:25:45.671 --> 1:25:48.338
We don't do that, Jacqueline.

1:25:53.412 --> 1:25:56.078
I loved him and
you killed him.

1:25:56.080 --> 1:25:58.682
No, you killed him by
bringing him into this mess

1:25:58.684 --> 1:25:59.949
and you know it.

1:25:59.951 --> 1:26:02.452
Drop your weapons!

1:26:02.454 --> 1:26:03.287
All of you!

1:26:03.289 --> 1:26:05.188
Don't! Don't!

1:26:05.190 --> 1:26:06.757
It's over, Crowe.

1:26:06.759 --> 1:26:07.957
No dice, Lemon.

1:26:07.959 --> 1:26:11.295
I've got as much shit on
you as you have on me.

1:26:11.297 --> 1:26:13.132
That what you think?

1:26:14.300 --> 1:26:15.299
I'll bring you
the deal that'll mean

1:26:15.301 --> 1:26:16.799
a lot more to both of us.

1:26:16.801 --> 1:26:18.067
50 million US dollars

1:26:18.069 --> 1:26:20.470
invested in this
business relationship.

1:26:20.472 --> 1:26:22.706
Until then, you watch your lip.

1:26:22.708 --> 1:26:25.377
And you call me DEA Agent Crowe.

1:26:27.078 --> 1:26:31.750
Cuff her.

1:26:36.588 --> 1:26:39.425
Never piss off a
partner in crime.

1:26:49.301 --> 1:26:53.770
Looks like you kids got
lucky at the tables tonight.

1:26:53.772 --> 1:26:56.807
Lady luck smiles
at you like that,

1:26:56.809 --> 1:26:59.244
you better smile back, right?

1:27:00.346 --> 1:27:02.479
Then get the fuck outta Dodge

1:27:02.481 --> 1:27:03.313
before that smile

1:27:03.315 --> 1:27:04.849
turns into a frown.

1:27:08.019 --> 1:27:08.986
Go.

1:27:11.357 --> 1:27:12.756
Go. Let's go.

1:27:28.807 --> 1:27:30.207
Tomorrow those kids
are gonna start dealing

1:27:30.209 --> 1:27:32.875
with their guilt until
they find the redemption

1:27:32.877 --> 1:27:34.944
that they need.

1:27:34.946 --> 1:27:38.515
One day, you're not gonna be
able to ignore it anymore.

1:27:38.517 --> 1:27:40.350
That's when you're gonna
have to stare your sins

1:27:40.352 --> 1:27:41.917
right in the eye.

1:27:41.919 --> 1:27:44.388
That's when you'll know

1:27:44.390 --> 1:27:45.524
I did my job.

1:27:49.495 --> 1:27:50.662
Take her away.

1:28:24.430 --> 1:28:26.061
Here.

1:28:51.924 --> 1:28:55.358
Baby, she gave us
a shot at a new life.

1:28:55.360 --> 1:28:59.129
Baby, she
gave us a future.

1:29:00.599 --> 1:29:03.300
But you heard what she said.

1:29:03.302 --> 1:29:05.402
Don't ever look back.

1:29:05.404 --> 1:29:06.736
You think it's because
she doesn't want us

1:29:06.738 --> 1:29:09.539
to linger on the person she was

1:29:09.541 --> 1:29:10.707
or because she
doesn't want us to see

1:29:10.709 --> 1:29:12.742
the person she's
going to become.

1:29:23.755 --> 1:29:25.087
I love you.

1:29:25.089 --> 1:29:26.890
I love you too, baby.

1:31:33.085 --> 1:31:34.953
"So life asked death,

1:31:36.455 --> 1:31:39.591
'Why do people love
me but hate you?'

1:31:44.096 --> 1:31:48.367
And death replied, 'Because
you're a beautiful lie.

1:31:49.468 --> 1:31:51.770
And I'm the painful truth.'"

1:31:55.307 --> 1:31:59.444
How painful is it?

1:32:01.480 --> 1:32:05.484
Like I've been searching
for peace all my life

1:32:07.252 --> 1:32:09.753
and all I found is a
reason to start a war.

1:33:24.730 --> 1:33:26.531
Please take a seat.

1:33:37.075 --> 1:33:42.047
You ready to make a deal?
