WEBVTT

00:35.785 --> 00:37.454
Godbrand is here.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.242
Brave livestock.

01:19.662 --> 01:21.122
Look out!

01:26.544 --> 01:28.505
Godbrand!

01:38.348 --> 01:39.724
Blood.

01:39.808 --> 01:44.813
I have dreamed of my legendary life
and now I am thirsty.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.482
Fuck your eyes, man,
bring me blood and beer.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.617
No, no, no, that's not fair.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.578
Damn it all. That bloody woman is right.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.414
Some things must be done.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.882
What the hell is this?

02:13.842 --> 02:16.386
-You don't know?
-I don't know.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.096
This is your house.

02:21.641 --> 02:25.186
-Do you know everything in your house?
-I don't have a house.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.771
She doesn't have a house.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.274
She's a Speaker. She's a nomad.

02:30.483 --> 02:31.776
I was rhetorical.

02:32.694 --> 02:36.656
-A rhetorical house that she doesn't have.
-Just tell me what it is.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.741
It was a magic mirror.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.119
Also known as distance mirrors.

02:41.953 --> 02:44.789
Some of them even allow matter
to pass through them, but...

02:48.543 --> 02:49.377
No.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.589
No, this is a simple
remote-viewing mirror.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.009
A little of the activating language
is chipped.

02:56.467 --> 02:59.262
A few of the runes need re-cutting
but workable.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.765
You have a fascinating
family junkyard, Belmont.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.268
You're a cockwart, Alucard.

03:06.728 --> 03:07.770
Stop it.

03:10.940 --> 03:14.903
You are an adult.
You do not have to rise to his every barb.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.196
He's pissing me off
like it's his job, Sypha.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.823
Grow up, Trevor.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.578
Why is your name Trevor, anyway?

03:24.329 --> 03:27.457
-I'm sorry?
-I understand the Belmont now,

03:27.582 --> 03:30.501
but Trevor
doesn't sound very local either.

03:31.377 --> 03:33.004
Oh, well...

03:33.504 --> 03:37.550
So, the story goes, a Celt rode out here
with Leon back in the day

03:38.301 --> 03:40.803
and his name was Trefor, with an F.

03:41.137 --> 03:45.016
-Trefor. I like that.
-Oh, it's terrible.

03:45.099 --> 03:45.934
Treff.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.686
-Treffy?
-Oh, my God, no.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.396
You are Treffy now.

03:50.772 --> 03:51.606
Don't--

04:11.292 --> 04:13.127
But Dracula respects my skills.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.464
And the human world cast me out long ago.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.178
Why would I go against his wishes?

04:22.470 --> 04:25.223
Dracula has failed his own people.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.435
He believes that he fell in love
with a human woman.

04:29.936 --> 04:30.853
He took a pet.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.023
You see that, don't you?

04:34.732 --> 04:36.109
I believe he loved her.

04:36.192 --> 04:39.612
He is capable of love.
That's the source of his conviction.

04:40.071 --> 04:44.492
If you love something, you act to keep it
with you for as long as you can.

04:45.618 --> 04:48.997
Instead, he allowed her
to be killed by other humans.

04:49.789 --> 04:50.748
He wasn't there.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.918
He wasn't, no.

04:54.877 --> 04:57.922
He was traveling, like a human,
at her whim.

04:58.339 --> 05:01.884
Not once did he move to protect her.
Not once did he consider

05:01.968 --> 05:05.596
making her a vampire
and bringing her into our community.

05:06.889 --> 05:11.185
You are loyal to Dracula
and the night world, aren't you?

05:12.520 --> 05:14.230
You would have protected her.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.151
Of course I would have.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.195
Of course you would.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.576
But, on some level...

05:28.036 --> 05:33.207
he considers us less important
than the brief life of a mistreated pet.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.794
Does that sound sane to you?

05:39.630 --> 05:40.882
Yeah, it sounds...

05:43.217 --> 05:44.052
confused.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.973
And now he has taken us to war.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.771
Should this war be prosecuted
by a confused man?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.607
I-- I don't know.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.445
Has it occurred to you that you yourself,

06:02.945 --> 06:05.198
a loyal servant of the night world,

06:05.531 --> 06:08.785
a prized asset in our lives and wars,

06:09.452 --> 06:12.538
-are in fact next to die?
-What?

06:13.414 --> 06:15.291
You're human, Hector.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.796
You threw in your lot with us

06:19.879 --> 06:22.799
because it was your path
to greatness and joy.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.843
But your loyalty counts for nothing

06:25.927 --> 06:28.638
when a man who has decreed death
to all humans,

06:28.721 --> 06:30.973
yet would not make his love a vampire,

06:31.390 --> 06:34.060
rampages across
the face of the Earth in mad fury.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.437
I ask you again,

06:37.188 --> 06:39.732
does that sound sane to you?

06:40.733 --> 06:42.860
He promised me this would be a cull.

06:43.194 --> 06:46.405
That humans would be reduced
in numbers and controlled.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.617
He is Dracula, Hector.

06:50.284 --> 06:52.620
Why would he tell the truth to a human?

06:53.704 --> 06:54.664
Even you?

06:56.791 --> 07:00.461
I just want to do my work, Carmilla.
I love my work.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.755
I know you do.

07:04.006 --> 07:07.301
And I have a way of ensuring
you will continue to do it.

07:08.803 --> 07:12.140
You just have to answer
one question for me.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.516
And what's that?

07:14.767 --> 07:18.271
Are you prepared to abandon Dracula
to win the war?

07:21.315 --> 07:24.026
You don't say something like that
out loud in this place.

07:24.652 --> 07:25.736
What matters more?

07:26.028 --> 07:29.449
Wiping the Earth of the humans you hate
and submitting to your own death

07:29.532 --> 07:32.452
or coddling a broken old man?

07:33.786 --> 07:36.998
The Castle must land at Braila, Hector.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.124
Why?

07:38.541 --> 07:39.792
Because I wish it.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.921
The Castle lands in Braila, by the river.

07:45.548 --> 07:49.510
Dracula's loyal forces
will leave the Castle to take the town.

07:49.802 --> 07:54.682
My own forces will take the Castle
and unseat Dracula.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.934
Saving your life.

07:57.935 --> 08:01.022
Going forward to control
and surround the human race.

08:08.362 --> 08:10.323
Dracula is powerful.

08:12.116 --> 08:14.243
Your forces alone may not be enough.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.371
You're right.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.041
Brilliant, Hector.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.043
They may not be...

08:23.961 --> 08:26.464
which is why you must do something for me.

09:01.165 --> 09:03.960
I heard you moving across the sand.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.339
That's very good, Isaac.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.676
Most people can't hear me moving at all.

09:12.677 --> 09:15.221
There's nothing out here but the sand.

09:16.055 --> 09:19.267
And even the wolves
don't come close to my little home.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.562
What brings you out here?

09:23.479 --> 09:24.313
You.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.066
You have need of my work.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.611
Invite me across your threshold, Isaac.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.953
Do you remember how we first met, Isaac?

09:39.787 --> 09:41.789
That would be difficult to forget.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.668
Say the words.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.588
So I know you are still my friend.

09:52.758 --> 09:56.554
I was being hunted by brigand magicians
who wanted to kill me,

09:57.597 --> 10:00.600
cut me up and sell my parts
to other magicians.

10:01.892 --> 10:04.520
Someone like me is, in parts of the world,

10:05.104 --> 10:08.608
a rich supply of ingredients
for potions, spells

10:08.691 --> 10:11.277
and even aphrodisiacs.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.654
And you saved me.

10:14.655 --> 10:15.489
I did.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.992
The only person in the world

10:18.075 --> 10:21.078
who ever lifted a hand
to protect me from anything.

10:22.413 --> 10:23.789
And he was not a human.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.126
You are still my friend.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.003
I am.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.839
I do have need of your work.

10:32.590 --> 10:36.052
The human race has betrayed me
for one final time,

10:36.552 --> 10:38.429
and they must be punished.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.057
War, then?

10:42.391 --> 10:44.185
You need an army of the night?

10:44.894 --> 10:46.145
You sound suspicious.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.064
You're not human.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.941
Your passions are rare and pure.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.819
War sounds like a small thing for you.

10:54.987 --> 10:58.699
It's the word you choose,
but it's not what you mean.

10:59.950 --> 11:00.785
No.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.412
I mean to end the human race.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.792
-And you want my help to do it.
-Yes.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.961
Even though I'm a human being.

11:12.004 --> 11:12.880
Yes.

11:14.256 --> 11:16.592
Do you remember my first words to you?

11:18.219 --> 11:19.053
Yes.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.264
Indulge me, Master Dracula.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.643
So that I may know
you are still my friend.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.353
You said,

11:28.354 --> 11:29.939
"I have no fear of death,

11:30.898 --> 11:33.275
it always sounded peaceful to me."

11:35.694 --> 11:37.530
I will be loyal to the end.

11:38.322 --> 11:39.240
And beyond.

11:40.616 --> 11:41.534
Let us begin.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.516
Drinking fucking pig blood?

12:05.599 --> 12:06.809
Fuck, no!

12:07.309 --> 12:11.355
We are the generals of the court
of Vlad Dracula Tepes

12:11.730 --> 12:14.608
and we deserve a proper fucking drink.

12:15.860 --> 12:19.447
The maps say
there's a town 20 miles away from here.

12:21.073 --> 12:24.452
They will never see us coming,
and fuck them if they do.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.245
Tonight, we feed.

14:03.968 --> 14:04.802
Isaac.

14:06.011 --> 14:09.431
I feel like the tone of the war hall
is turning against me.

14:10.224 --> 14:13.227
Even Hector looks at me
as if he no longer knows me.

14:13.978 --> 14:17.940
I have respect for Hector,
but he is a gentle soul.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.484
He is still a little boy.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.946
Probably the same little boy
who didn't understand

14:24.029 --> 14:26.115
why he was beaten for keeping pets.

14:28.409 --> 14:33.038
Well, his pets
were reanimated dead animals.

14:33.789 --> 14:37.793
One can understand any parent's discomfort

14:37.877 --> 14:40.713
with a dead cat
doing a dance in the living room.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.884
He really only wants pets, you see?

14:46.135 --> 14:48.554
He really only understands pets.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.140
That's how he perceives your war.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.894
To cull humans back to a small population

14:55.227 --> 14:58.564
and then keep them in pens,
he understands that.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.317
That is partly my fault.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.486
He's a child in a man's body.

15:04.653 --> 15:07.281
That does make him easy to lie to.

15:08.532 --> 15:09.491
You are Dracula.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.620
No one has a right to your true beliefs.

15:14.038 --> 15:14.872
Not even you?

15:15.831 --> 15:16.707
Not even me.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.754
You've given me purpose
and treated me with respect.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.256
A lie wouldn't change that.

15:25.674 --> 15:26.967
You are unique.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.428
You don't owe anybody anything.

15:31.138 --> 15:34.266
You, Isaac, are the only one
I've told the truth to.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.645
Because I believe you are the only one

15:38.270 --> 15:40.356
who grasps the necessity of it all.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.070
You rarely come to my working place.

15:47.237 --> 15:50.407
How can I be of service to you,
Master Dracula?

15:53.702 --> 15:55.287
Are you still my friend?

15:57.247 --> 15:58.082
Always.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.835
Then know that you may be alone.

17:59.119 --> 17:59.953
Are you okay?

18:01.663 --> 18:02.498
Tired.

18:04.958 --> 18:05.793
Sleep, then.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.463
A bit lonely.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.096
My dusty old sheet is big enough for two.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.057
And nobody was ever lonely in this house.

18:26.563 --> 18:27.397
Thank you.

18:28.857 --> 18:29.942
Is Alucard asleep?

18:31.819 --> 18:33.695
He says he's slept enough.

18:34.154 --> 18:38.325
He's still poking around your family's
things with a look of faint disgust.

18:39.493 --> 18:43.413
It's lonely even when you're
standing next to him. It's strange.

18:44.623 --> 18:45.457
How so?

18:46.458 --> 18:47.584
I'm not sure.

18:48.710 --> 18:52.381
He's intelligent,
sometimes even witty, in his way.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.342
And he's certainly half-human.

18:55.843 --> 18:58.929
More than half-human.
He's a person in his own right.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.517
But it's like he's a cold spot
in the room.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.937
It's not like your sadness.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.522
I'm not sad.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.440
Yes, you are.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.152
But I can shout at you or tease you

19:13.235 --> 19:16.238
and get a reaction
that lets me know you're still in there.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.575
His sadness is like an icy well.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.160
It's bottomless.

19:22.327 --> 19:25.664
And it swallows up your voice
and anything you try to drop into it.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.709
-Am I really sad?
-All the time.

19:29.918 --> 19:33.005
You don't even notice it now.
It's just how you are.

19:34.631 --> 19:39.595
And then, sometimes, you'll tell me
nobody's ever lonely in your house,

19:40.470 --> 19:42.431
and offer me your stinky blanket.

19:44.308 --> 19:48.687
In all honesty,
that stink might not be my blanket.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.419
I wish you would stop doing that.

20:12.628 --> 20:13.670
It's sick.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.591
The body is sick.

20:18.258 --> 20:19.676
It must be purged.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.887
It must be focused.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.598
This is holy work.

20:26.099 --> 20:29.561
How did Dracula
draft you into his service, I wonder?

20:30.520 --> 20:33.649
I make purity from human corruption.

20:34.816 --> 20:38.487
Human corruption is a stain on the world.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.073
It was a simple choice.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.243
Well, talking about choices...

20:44.743 --> 20:47.120
Carmilla is making a lot of sense to me.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.040
In what way?

20:50.749 --> 20:51.833
There's no plan.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.295
Dracula doesn't act on
our recommendations,

20:55.379 --> 20:57.589
he barely listens to you and Hector.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.884
We're just thrashing around
the country randomly.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.262
There is an intent.

21:03.887 --> 21:06.056
We don't need strict battle plans.

21:06.556 --> 21:08.725
We simply follow his intent.

21:09.393 --> 21:12.312
We didn't need to hit
Gresit right away, you know?

21:12.604 --> 21:16.900
We should have been made aware
that Alucard was under the bloody city.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.819
Alucard is nothing.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.320
A spoiled child.

21:20.654 --> 21:23.949
Alucard knows almost
as much as Dracula himself,

21:24.157 --> 21:25.701
and is almost as strong.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.121
And, it turns out,
violently opposed to the war

21:29.204 --> 21:33.208
because his human mother
wouldn't have wanted it or some shit.

21:34.209 --> 21:38.213
I'm saying it may be time
for the old man to sit in his study

21:38.380 --> 21:41.216
and let the rest of us
take care of this for him.

21:41.675 --> 21:42.634
Do it right.

21:43.010 --> 21:47.806
Set up livestock pens
and pursue the war properly without him.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.475
You would betray Dracula?

21:51.393 --> 21:52.728
It's not betrayal.

21:53.270 --> 21:57.482
Unless the old man
decides to be difficult about it.

22:02.696 --> 22:03.655
I see.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.807
Thank you for revealing to me

22:30.891 --> 22:34.978
how the corruption of the world
has made its way into Dracula's court.

22:35.437 --> 22:38.106
Thank you for showing me the truth.
