00:13.083 --> 00:14.542
- Tonight,
the dramatic conclusion

00:14.542 --> 00:16.625
of the "Vanderpump Rules"
reunion...

00:16.667 --> 00:18.958
- There were a couple months
where I didn't hear from her,

00:19.000 --> 00:21.458
and I was like,
"Wow, so she did use me."

00:21.500 --> 00:23.167
- Literally, you'd be mad at me
if I didn't own up to it,

00:23.208 --> 00:24.500
and you'd be mad at me if I did.

00:24.542 --> 00:25.708
It's--I can't win.

00:25.708 --> 00:27.875
- I didn't have a choice,
Stassi.

00:27.875 --> 00:29.333
- There's always a choice.

00:29.375 --> 00:30.875
- Why didn't you write
the contract then

00:30.875 --> 00:31.958
and give it to me
to give to him?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.708
- Lisa, because you did this
behind my back.

00:33.708 --> 00:36.375
- Well, you made me promise
not to tell any of your friends

00:36.375 --> 00:37.542
for the longest time,
and I didn't.

00:37.542 --> 00:38.708
- You were trying
to blackmail me.

00:38.750 --> 00:41.208
- Why did you have sex
with James that night?

00:41.208 --> 00:43.542
- I think that was a really
fáááed up thing to say.

00:43.583 --> 00:44.875
- I'm tired of not pretending
there's an issue here.

00:44.917 --> 00:46.208
Can we talk about it?
You go,

00:46.208 --> 00:47.458
"I'm tired of pretending
to have fun with you."

00:47.500 --> 00:48.875
Okay.

00:48.917 --> 00:50.083
- Jax, you're jealous, mate.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.167
I've said it once,
I'll say it again.

00:51.208 --> 00:52.333
- Jealous?
Are you kidding?

00:52.375 --> 00:53.667
- When your veins start
coming out of your neck,

00:53.708 --> 00:55.583
I get freaked out.
- And you should be.

00:55.625 --> 00:57.708
- What are you gonna do?
I'm waiting for it, mate.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.042
- It's gonna happen.
It's gonna happen.

00:59.083 --> 01:01.042
- I'll punch you
in your fat throat, mate.

01:01.083 --> 01:03.750
- Shut up!
- All of you are assáááá.

01:03.792 --> 01:05.500
Assáááá, assáááá,
assáááá, assáááá

01:07.250 --> 01:09.542
- This is the funniest fáááing
reunion I've ever been on.

01:09.583 --> 01:11.750
- Part three of
the "Vanderpump Rules" reunion

01:11.750 --> 01:13.042
starts now.

01:14.292 --> 01:17.083
- ♪ Just raise
your glasses high ♪

01:17.125 --> 01:20.417
♪ This one's
for you tonight ♪

01:22.750 --> 01:24.750
- Lisa, last year
at the reunion,

01:24.750 --> 01:26.750
Stassi told us
for the first time

01:26.750 --> 01:29.250
that her big problem
with the group

01:29.250 --> 01:33.125
was how the issue
of the sex tape was handled.

01:33.167 --> 01:34.958
- If I hated somebody

01:34.958 --> 01:38.292
and I saw that their
ex-boyfriend was saying--

01:38.292 --> 01:40.042
was--was showing a video,

01:40.083 --> 01:41.792
I would get on the phone
immediately.

01:41.833 --> 01:43.458
First of all, I would say,
"Put that fáááing sháá away."

01:43.458 --> 01:44.625
- I did say that.

01:44.625 --> 01:45.958
- And I would call someone
immediately--

01:46.000 --> 01:47.292
No, you--you watched it and you
let everybody else watch it.

01:47.292 --> 01:48.792
- Yeah, because I wanted to see

01:48.792 --> 01:50.208
what this whole thing was

01:50.250 --> 01:52.792
so I knew if he tried
to do something with it.

01:52.792 --> 01:54.208
- You were involved in that.

01:54.250 --> 01:55.958
What--what was your place
in that?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.625
- Well, I mean, she was
very, very upset about it,

01:59.667 --> 02:02.125
and I'm protective
of all of them.

02:02.125 --> 02:05.458
It was something that would have
been very, very embarrassing.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.708
- You put up $900
to make it go away.

02:07.750 --> 02:08.958
- I did, yeah,
'cause--

02:08.958 --> 02:10.417
- How was it $900
and not $1,000?

02:10.458 --> 02:12.333
- Well, you know what,
because it was some--

02:12.333 --> 02:14.833
- I'm not good at making a sex
tape, you know what I mean?

02:14.875 --> 02:17.125
It was only worth $900.

02:17.167 --> 02:18.833
- Couldn't even break
four figures.

02:18.875 --> 02:20.333
- No, no.
- It wasn't about money.

02:20.333 --> 02:22.667
That's why when she came in
and she kind of threw--

02:22.708 --> 02:24.000
you know, said,
"Here's the money,"

02:24.042 --> 02:25.667
it was never about the money.

02:25.667 --> 02:26.833
All I wanted was her
to acknowledge--

02:26.875 --> 02:29.500
- But you had kinda gone
to my parents and told us--

02:29.500 --> 02:32.292
every time you saw us, you guys
would say, "You owe me $900."

02:32.333 --> 02:34.583
- No, I wanted you
to acknowledge it.

02:34.625 --> 02:36.083
And I even said,
"Give it to charity."

02:36.125 --> 02:38.667
I didn't give a damn.
I wanted you to acknowledge it.

02:38.708 --> 02:40.833
- Lisa, I was so appreciative
that you were willing to help.

02:40.833 --> 02:42.083
And then when I talked
to you on the phone--

02:42.125 --> 02:43.333
- Of course, you were begging me
on the phone.

02:43.375 --> 02:45.667
- I said, "I will not give him
a dime unless he--"

02:45.667 --> 02:47.792
That video was handed over
and a contract was signed.

02:47.833 --> 02:49.458
- I didn't have
a choice, Stassi.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.667
- There's always a choice!

02:50.667 --> 02:52.500
- Really?
I was saving your ass.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.042
- But he walked away
with the video.

02:54.083 --> 02:56.458
He could still go right away--
he could go right now tomorrow--

02:56.500 --> 02:58.208
- Well, yes, of course.
Let me explain to you--

02:58.208 --> 02:59.667
- I said please don't do that

02:59.708 --> 03:01.167
without getting him
to sign something.

03:01.208 --> 03:03.333
- Let me explain to you--
don't be ridiculous.

03:03.375 --> 03:06.042
- Which is why I asked, please,
like, make him sign a contract.

03:06.042 --> 03:08.458
I said, "Please, nobody
give him anything unless--"

03:08.500 --> 03:09.875
- No, no, no,
that wasn't the conversation.

03:09.917 --> 03:11.792
It was, "Please, oh, my God,
he's gonna release it--"

03:11.833 --> 03:13.542
- She didn't want him to have--
- Oh, shut up, Kristen,

03:13.583 --> 03:14.708
you don't know
anything about it.

03:14.750 --> 03:15.875
She was literally sobbing--
- Shut up?

03:15.875 --> 03:17.542
- Yeah, shut up.
She was literally

03:17.583 --> 03:19.542
sobbing on the phone.
- Wow, that's fáááing rude.

03:19.542 --> 03:21.375
- And you're like,
Ms. Manners over there?

03:21.417 --> 03:23.125
I don't think so.
- He needs to sign a contract--

03:23.167 --> 03:24.542
- Why didn't you write
the contract then

03:24.542 --> 03:25.708
and give it to me
to give to him?

03:25.750 --> 03:27.208
- Lisa, because
you did this behind my back.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.167
I would have!
- That's what I do.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.292
- I want to move on.
- That's what I do.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.208
- James, why did you decide
it was a good idea

03:33.250 --> 03:36.500
to share every gory detail
of Lala's sex life

03:36.542 --> 03:40.250
with your boss, Lisa Vanderpump,
at a dentist's office?

03:40.250 --> 03:41.875
- Faith told me that
she was eating some assáááá

03:41.917 --> 03:43.417
the night before,
and then we met up the next day.

03:43.417 --> 03:44.750
- Are you fáááing
kidding?

03:44.792 --> 03:45.833
- Yeah, dude,
it was fáááing disgusting.

03:45.875 --> 03:46.917
- What do you mean?
What?

03:46.958 --> 03:48.583
- Rimjob.
- What are you talking about?

03:48.625 --> 03:50.583
I am not listening to this.
Stop it.

03:50.625 --> 03:52.708
Give it to me.
Give it to me now.

03:52.750 --> 03:54.375
- Okay, so--
- Oh, that was awful.

03:54.417 --> 03:56.000
There's nothing you can say
to defend yourself.

03:56.042 --> 03:57.708
You might as well quit
while you're ahead.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.250
- My fáááing ego got to me
and I didn't like the fact

03:59.292 --> 04:00.250
that she was in bed with him

04:00.292 --> 04:01.875
the night before
getting in bed with me.

04:01.917 --> 04:04.250
- Why tell me?
- Oh, well, I mean...

04:04.250 --> 04:06.500
We were just chatting about
relationships in general.

04:06.542 --> 04:07.917
We were talking
about Max's relationship--

04:07.917 --> 04:10.750
- I don't even talk
to my kids about sex and--

04:10.792 --> 04:13.083
- There's a difference between
speaking about a relationship

04:13.083 --> 04:15.917
and speaking about something
that goes down in my bedroom,

04:15.958 --> 04:17.750
that I have a girl--

04:17.792 --> 04:19.292
- Well, you've spoken now
about stuff,

04:19.292 --> 04:21.375
like, that's happened
in the bedroom with us, right?

04:21.417 --> 04:23.250
You've outspoken that
to the world, so...

04:23.292 --> 04:26.125
- Let's just say my condom
drawer is full of Magnums,

04:26.125 --> 04:29.792
and James would not be able
to use any of those.

04:29.792 --> 04:33.792
I didn't find you at age 19 and
stick with you through college--

04:33.833 --> 04:35.708
- I don't care how long
you were with him--

04:35.750 --> 04:37.083
- I do. I care.
- I know you do.

04:37.125 --> 04:38.792
But it was a matter of,
uh, you know,

04:38.792 --> 04:40.250
I understand
that that was wrong

04:40.292 --> 04:42.125
about spilling the beans,
and I do apologize.

04:42.125 --> 04:44.417
- I'm mortified about that.
I'm still mortified.

04:44.458 --> 04:47.625
I feel awful that he's put in
the position that he's put in.

04:47.625 --> 04:50.292
And this has literally--
we can't even speak.

04:50.292 --> 04:52.208
I mean, we've blocked
each other's numbers.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.542
- Oh, really, did this cause...
- Yes!

04:54.583 --> 04:57.625
Like, this is something--
Like, I...

04:57.625 --> 05:00.167
- He didn't sign up for this.
- No and this was not...

05:00.208 --> 05:03.417
I mean...
- You did, James, you know.

05:03.458 --> 05:05.250
- I did, but I didn't
drop his name,

05:05.292 --> 05:06.625
nor will I know,

05:06.667 --> 05:08.333
- It doesn't matter.
- But you know, you did.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.792
- What goes down and what
went down is nothing weird.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.583
- I was kidding,
I was kidding.

05:15.625 --> 05:16.917
- No.

05:16.958 --> 05:19.458
- Just to have someone
who I cared about very deeply

05:19.500 --> 05:23.833
no longer in my life because of
this is a really sháááy thing.

05:23.875 --> 05:26.458
So...
- Oh, darling, don't cry.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.250
- Nope, we're not
gonna cry over him.

05:28.292 --> 05:31.667
It's all good.

05:31.708 --> 05:34.500
- Speaking of
puckering and pouting,

05:34.542 --> 05:37.458
Katie, why was the launch party
for your fashion blog

05:37.500 --> 05:39.000
such a tough ticket?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.542
- Uh, well, it's something
that I've been working on

05:40.542 --> 05:42.875
really, really hard and
really proud of for over a year.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.375
And I wanted
to keep the guest list small.

05:44.375 --> 05:45.500
Most of the people
that were coming

05:45.542 --> 05:47.375
have been people
that have been supportive of it,

05:47.417 --> 05:48.625
people that are helping
with the party,

05:48.667 --> 05:50.042
like, people that even
knew what was going on

05:50.042 --> 05:51.833
or even had known me
for more than five minutes.

05:51.875 --> 05:53.708
I thought I was maybe
doing damage control

05:53.708 --> 05:55.542
rather than them, like,
finding out and being like,

05:55.542 --> 05:57.208
"Oh, what a bitch, she didn't
even mention it to me."

05:57.250 --> 05:58.875
Like, and if I had people
start showing up

05:58.875 --> 06:00.792
to come and yell
at their ex-girlfriend, I mean,

06:00.833 --> 06:02.833
that looks bad on me,
so thank you for doing that.

06:02.875 --> 06:04.458
- Wait, what?
- What?

06:04.500 --> 06:06.125
- Were you talking to me?
- Yeah, I was talking to you.

06:06.167 --> 06:07.208
- Sorry. I didn't hear you.

06:07.208 --> 06:08.292
- Yeah, thank you
for embarrassing me

06:08.333 --> 06:09.375
in front of the owners
of the salon

06:09.375 --> 06:10.542
by showing up
to come yell at her

06:10.542 --> 06:12.125
when I specifically
asked you not to.

06:12.167 --> 06:13.375
- I don't want you in my life.
- Shut up!

06:13.375 --> 06:14.792
I'm a fáááing man, all right?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.375
I walk up to your fáááing
ugly boyfriend upstairs,

06:16.375 --> 06:18.333
shake his hand
like a fáááing bloke.

06:18.375 --> 06:20.042
You, on the other,
you're, like, fáááing cringing

06:20.042 --> 06:21.292
and shaking every five minutes,

06:21.333 --> 06:24.333
calling me fáááing names
nonstop.

06:24.375 --> 06:25.708
I know, I apologize
for crashing the party.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.542
- Thank you for almost
tarnishing a relationship.

06:27.583 --> 06:28.750
That's awesome.

06:28.792 --> 06:30.583
- Kristen, you're the--
you're the queen

06:30.583 --> 06:32.667
of stomping into parties
when you're not invited.

06:32.708 --> 06:36.250
What did you think
when James showed up at Katie's?

06:36.292 --> 06:37.500
- I wanted
nothing to do with him.

06:37.542 --> 06:39.042
It was just like,
what is the damage control

06:39.083 --> 06:40.417
that I can do
for Katie right now?

06:40.458 --> 06:43.083
If I take it downstairs, if I
go have this quick conversation,

06:43.083 --> 06:46.042
will he just leave,
or if I refuse right now,

06:46.083 --> 06:48.250
is he gonna start yelling at me
in the middle of the party?

06:48.292 --> 06:50.333
And then, in turn,
he did scream at me

06:50.375 --> 06:51.583
because he didn't get his way.

06:51.583 --> 06:56.708
- So at the party, uh, Schwartz
gets a text from Stassi.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.917
Why do you think
she reached out to you?

06:58.917 --> 07:01.000
- Because I'm the
second weakest link.

07:01.042 --> 07:02.417
- No, no, no.
- I'm kidding.

07:02.417 --> 07:04.792
- That's what Jax said.
- It's so true.

07:04.833 --> 07:07.917
- We did have
a very close relationship.

07:07.958 --> 07:10.708
Like, I--you know,
we--we hung out without Katie.

07:10.750 --> 07:12.208
- Why did you go to him?

07:12.250 --> 07:14.792
- Schwartz is so level-headed
and reasonable

07:14.792 --> 07:17.625
and so--and I-I was close
to him for so long.

07:17.625 --> 07:20.292
- She did such an amazing job,
the conversation they had.

07:20.292 --> 07:22.292
- When you severed ties
with Katie,

07:22.292 --> 07:24.292
it was so cold and so rigid,

07:24.333 --> 07:28.542
and you were just so ruthlessly
dismissive that it was, like--

07:28.583 --> 07:32.292
I mean, it was just disgusting.
You were a fáááing bitch.

07:33.667 --> 07:35.542
- First time I've ever seen him
stand up, especially,

07:35.583 --> 07:37.458
you know, on Katie's behalf,
it was really--

07:37.500 --> 07:39.250
it was great to watch,
like, good for you.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.042
And it was awesome--
- Katie, what was your reaction

07:41.083 --> 07:44.458
when you saw him
stand up that way to Stassi?

07:44.458 --> 07:48.792
- Oh, I-I think I described it
as, like, poetic, almost.

07:48.833 --> 07:50.000
I--like, it was just,
like, eloquent.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Like, he--I mean, he read her
to the ground.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.458
- Well, calling her
a fáááing bitch

07:53.500 --> 07:55.000
sounds like poem to me,
mate.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.917
- She needed to have the smack
brought down upon her.

07:57.958 --> 08:00.500
I don't know if I was the right
guy to do it, but I was the--

08:00.500 --> 08:02.500
- No, you were absolutely
the right guy to do it,

08:02.500 --> 08:04.167
because I respect
what you have to say.

08:04.208 --> 08:05.625
I mean, if, like,
Jax would have delivered that,

08:05.667 --> 08:07.167
I would be like,
"Get the fááá out of here."

08:07.208 --> 08:09.167
You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:09.167 --> 08:11.417
- Stassi, were you surprised
by how he came across to you?

08:11.458 --> 08:13.000
- Heck, yes, I was surprised.
- You were?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.625
- I was, like,
shaking in my boots.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.333
I'm like, "Is this for real
right now?"

08:16.333 --> 08:17.833
- So after laying down
the hammer,

08:17.875 --> 08:19.500
you invited her
to your engagement party.

08:19.542 --> 08:20.833
- Yeah.
- Why?

08:20.833 --> 08:22.833
- Well, 'cause, I mean--
- She knew those--

08:22.833 --> 08:25.667
She know th-those tears
would get him.

08:25.667 --> 08:27.875
- Well, and I do think
they were authentic tears--

08:27.917 --> 08:29.542
Tom thinks
they were alligator tears.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.458
I-I thought
she was being sincere.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.833
And I thought she had earned it.
Maybe I'm a sucker.

08:33.875 --> 08:35.875
- I'm not saying
that those tears weren't real.

08:35.875 --> 08:39.167
I just feel like
you're a smart enough person

08:39.208 --> 08:42.125
to know that, okay, like,
"I'm gonna go in there.

08:42.167 --> 08:44.708
"Schwartz is gonna bitch me out.
I'm gonna feel bad.

08:44.708 --> 08:46.708
"If I start crying,
he's gonna feel bad,

08:46.708 --> 08:48.167
"and at the end of the day,

08:48.208 --> 08:50.458
I'll probably get what I want.
It'll probably work."

08:50.500 --> 08:52.708
- I didn't expect Schwartz
would actually be like that.

08:52.708 --> 08:54.375
I never expected that.

08:54.375 --> 08:56.042
And you know what's weird
is that, like, you keep--

08:56.083 --> 08:57.833
I feel like people who think
people are calculated

08:57.875 --> 08:59.708
might be calculated themselves.
- You snapped back at him and

08:59.708 --> 09:02.708
said, "I didn't kill your dog."
- Because I don't ever question

09:02.708 --> 09:04.042
somebody's motives, like, ever,
because

09:04.083 --> 09:06.208
I'm assuming everyone's just--
- Yeah, you do.

09:06.208 --> 09:08.333
- Not when they're--
- Yeah, you do.

09:08.375 --> 09:09.708
- When they're being nice to me,

09:09.750 --> 09:11.583
I do not question
why they're being nice to me.

09:11.625 --> 09:13.375
I don't question
somebody apologizing.

09:13.417 --> 09:15.500
I don't question that.
- I feel like--

09:15.542 --> 09:17.708
- Like, for some--for me to go
and humble myself like that--

09:17.750 --> 09:20.167
It sucked. I don't like it.
I hate apologizing.

09:20.208 --> 09:22.542
- Well, you wouldn't have had to
do it in the first place.

09:22.583 --> 09:24.250
- Literally, you'd be mad at me
if I didn't own up to it,

09:24.292 --> 09:25.375
and you'd be mad at me if I did.

09:25.417 --> 09:27.583
Like, it's--I can't win.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.083
- I can make a comment on

09:31.083 --> 09:33.083
whatever the hell
I want to make a comment on.

09:33.083 --> 09:34.542
- If you're gonna give an
opinion that I disagree with

09:34.583 --> 09:35.917
and you're gonna rip on
one of my friends,

09:35.917 --> 09:38.042
you're gonna get it
handed right back to you.

09:47.417 --> 09:51.708
of "Vanderpump Rules."

09:51.750 --> 09:53.292
At Lala's house party,

09:53.333 --> 09:56.917
Stassi approached Scheana
and made up with her.

09:56.958 --> 09:59.958
Scheana, did you think that
Stassi was sincere that night?

09:59.958 --> 10:03.625
- I did, and at
the end of the conversation,

10:03.667 --> 10:05.625
it was like we were literally
looking each other

10:05.625 --> 10:07.792
so deep in the eyes
that it kinda freaked me out

10:07.792 --> 10:11.417
for a second, but we were able
to see each other's truths,

10:11.458 --> 10:13.917
and once we had
that conversation,

10:13.958 --> 10:16.375
her and I got really close.

10:16.417 --> 10:19.583
Then when filming wrapped,
there were a couple months

10:19.625 --> 10:21.917
where I didn't hear from her
and I was like,

10:21.958 --> 10:23.625
"Wow, so she did use me."

10:23.667 --> 10:26.083
So she did just want
to get Katie back,

10:26.125 --> 10:28.292
and now that they're back
and they're hanging out,

10:28.292 --> 10:30.458
she doesn't want
anything to do with me.

10:30.458 --> 10:32.292
And then in Utah,

10:32.333 --> 10:34.667
her and I actually had
a really good conversation.

10:34.708 --> 10:36.667
- Which was last month.
- Yeah.

10:36.667 --> 10:39.000
- We all went to Utah
for Katie's 30th birthday.

10:39.042 --> 10:41.750
- We had so much fun.
- Everyone got along.

10:41.792 --> 10:43.333
We played charades.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.333
Like, it was just--
- We all put on onesies.

10:45.375 --> 10:46.792
Like, I've talked to her

10:46.833 --> 10:48.333
every day since.
- Wow.

10:48.375 --> 10:52.833
- I am learning that each friend
has different needs.

10:52.833 --> 10:55.667
And I kind of have--
I am a selfish person.

10:55.667 --> 10:58.500
We all know this,
and I'm trying not to be

10:58.500 --> 11:01.000
and realize that not everybody
wants the same type of--

11:01.042 --> 11:03.167
Like, I don't need
to be responded to

11:03.208 --> 11:04.292
on a text all the time.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.000
Scheana needs a response.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.333
People need different things
out of friendships,

11:08.333 --> 11:11.500
and I realized that, like, okay,
that's what Scheana needs.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.708
- I think most people
need a response from texts.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.833
- Katie got everyone together
on the beach

11:16.875 --> 11:19.375
to see Schwartz
shiver and complain,

11:19.375 --> 11:21.542
uh, through engagement photos.

11:21.542 --> 11:23.208
- Oh...

11:23.250 --> 11:24.542
- She just, like,
pulled him out of--

11:24.583 --> 11:25.792
- Go, go!

11:25.833 --> 11:27.708
I'm not doing it.

11:27.750 --> 11:30.042
- Schwartz,
is that what models do?

11:30.042 --> 11:32.333
- More or less, yeah.
- Yes?

11:32.375 --> 11:34.458
Before your big day
at the beach,

11:34.500 --> 11:37.875
James was over at Pump
getting fired.

11:37.875 --> 11:40.375
Uh, James, what is your version
of the story?

11:40.375 --> 11:42.208
- All right, well,
I'm gonna say now,

11:42.208 --> 11:44.042
please don't interrupt me
while I'm speaking.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.042
Basically, I was at Pump.

11:46.042 --> 11:48.792
Kristen, lo and behold,
shows up yet again.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.125
You know, egging me on,
talking about how she's, like,

11:51.167 --> 11:53.208
messaging DJs and all this sháá.

11:53.208 --> 11:54.875
I was like, honestly, like,
what the hell?

11:54.875 --> 11:56.417
And then--
- You were drunk.

11:56.458 --> 11:58.875
- Yeah, Pump and Glories, mate.
They wind me up.

11:58.917 --> 12:00.208
You can't even taste
the alcohol,

12:00.250 --> 12:02.333
and I swear to God,
they fááá you up.

12:02.375 --> 12:04.917
- Okay.
- So, um...

12:04.917 --> 12:06.208
So yeah, Kristen came--

12:06.250 --> 12:07.917
- Kristen, when she shows up,

12:07.917 --> 12:09.750
she provokes a situation.

12:09.750 --> 12:12.250
- No, I didn't provoke anything.
- Why did you show up?

12:12.250 --> 12:13.917
- We were at the bar.
He got in my face.

12:13.958 --> 12:15.667
- But why were you there?

12:15.708 --> 12:18.083
There's a hundred bars.
Kristen--

12:18.125 --> 12:20.042
- I don't even want to be
in the same city as him.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.417
He makes my skin crawl.

12:21.417 --> 12:23.417
- Then why did you show up
at his work, man?

12:23.417 --> 12:25.542
Come on, you know
what you're doing, Kristen.

12:25.583 --> 12:27.583
You know James is delicate.

12:27.583 --> 12:29.667
Let's--we all know
James is delicate.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.208
- Delicate?
- Yes.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.917
He's volatile.
- Yeah.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.917
- He's a short--he's got
a tiny little fuse.

12:34.917 --> 12:36.917
- Then fáááing handle it!
- I know, but you know that.

12:36.917 --> 12:38.208
- You are holding the matches.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.417
- And you would show up
at his place of work

12:40.458 --> 12:41.958
that you have no business
being at.

12:41.958 --> 12:43.625
- You didn't need to be there.
- You're not welcome,

12:43.625 --> 12:45.125
and you're banned.
- James, go fááá yourself.

12:45.167 --> 12:47.875
- Oh, shut up, okay?
- Being in the same room

12:47.917 --> 12:49.292
with you right now
is making my skin crawl.

12:49.292 --> 12:50.875
- Welcome to our world.

12:50.917 --> 12:52.458
Unfortunately--

12:52.458 --> 12:54.042
- Will someone fáááing
speak up on my behalf

12:54.083 --> 12:57.125
so I don't have to keep
doing this?

12:57.125 --> 12:59.625
- I don't know your behalf.

12:59.625 --> 13:01.875
- Let's go back.
James?

13:01.917 --> 13:04.625
- Basically got into
an altercation with her,

13:04.667 --> 13:06.958
we're yelling at each other,
and then Richardson,

13:06.958 --> 13:09.458
like, the star waiter,
like, nicest guy ever,

13:09.500 --> 13:11.792
comes up, tries to diffuse
the situation

13:11.833 --> 13:15.750
and obviously James is,
like, in his face:

13:15.792 --> 13:17.292
"Mind your own business,
blah, blah, blah."

13:17.292 --> 13:19.667
It was just, like,
now just me fighting with

13:19.708 --> 13:21.333
whoever the fááá was in my way.

13:21.375 --> 13:22.833
- And Richardson

13:22.833 --> 13:24.292
is the kindest...
- Kindest guy.

13:24.333 --> 13:26.583
- Sweetest,
most hard-working man

13:26.625 --> 13:28.167
who's worked for me
for seven years.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.500
- I'm sorry, though--didn't
you say "You're beneath me,

13:30.500 --> 13:33.500
you're nothing, I'm
motherááááing James Kennedy?"

13:33.500 --> 13:36.125
- You said you're not talented.
You're nothing.

13:36.167 --> 13:38.500
You're beneath me.
I'm above you.

13:38.542 --> 13:39.833
I'm James Kennedy.

13:41.167 --> 13:42.958
- After watching that back,
I was horrified.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.250
I really was.

13:44.292 --> 13:46.333
- He just needs a good face
punching, not from me.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.083
- You had a tough conversation
with James.

13:48.125 --> 13:50.125
Why did you feel
the need to suspend him?

13:50.167 --> 13:51.833
- Nah, she fired me.
- How many times

13:51.833 --> 13:52.792
did you get suspended
before you get fired?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.167
- You have to understand--
You?

13:54.167 --> 13:55.333
You're asking?
Really?

13:55.333 --> 13:56.958
Are you sure you want
to ask that question?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.500
- I've been suspended once
in six years.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.708
- If I don't back up my staff,

14:00.750 --> 14:03.875
and I have, what, 250 of them
or whatever,

14:03.875 --> 14:06.167
then there's gonna be complete
anarchy, for God's sake.

14:06.208 --> 14:08.958
He has to respect somebody
who's above him.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.875
And so he's hanging on
by the skin of his teeth,

14:10.875 --> 14:13.000
and he's working here
one night a week.

14:13.042 --> 14:14.708
- Is he bussing

14:14.708 --> 14:17.292
or are you DJing?
- No, I'm DJing now.

14:17.333 --> 14:18.625
- You are?
- Yes.

14:18.667 --> 14:21.833
- Did you ever think
maybe drinking is not

14:21.875 --> 14:23.333
something that agrees with you?

14:23.375 --> 14:26.708
- Yeah, I'm just gonna try
my best this year to do better.

14:26.750 --> 14:30.042
- Ariana, at the beach,
you were offended

14:30.042 --> 14:32.708
that Kristen had kind of
dipped her toe

14:32.750 --> 14:34.875
in the sketch comedy world.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.833
- Wow, has she been
taking sketch classes

14:36.875 --> 14:38.375
or did she just kinda,
like, decide

14:38.417 --> 14:40.125
she was gonna start
being funny or...

14:40.167 --> 14:42.042
- I thought it was pretty funny.

14:42.083 --> 14:43.375
- I mean, if you're gonna
do sketch comedy,

14:43.417 --> 14:45.375
you should maybe, like,
take a class or something.

14:45.417 --> 14:46.917
- I don't know what she does
in her free time.

14:46.917 --> 14:48.917
- I take sketch comedy
very seriously,

14:48.958 --> 14:50.667
so it offends me
when people just think

14:50.708 --> 14:53.417
that they can just...
do it.

14:53.458 --> 14:57.417
I don't buy a camera and then
call myself a photographer.

14:57.417 --> 14:59.542
- What does that have to do
with my comedy?

14:59.583 --> 15:02.000
- Well, you've never--
- How would you even know?

15:02.042 --> 15:03.417
Do you know anything about--

15:03.417 --> 15:06.083
- I asked the question, and
nobody seemed to have an answer.

15:06.083 --> 15:08.583
I said, "Is she taking a class?
Is she training?

15:08.583 --> 15:11.917
"Is she just gonna go ahead
and decide she's funny

15:11.958 --> 15:14.917
after being...
psychotic but--"

15:14.958 --> 15:16.750
- I think she's just
having fun with it.

15:16.792 --> 15:19.250
- Yeah, why is it
that big of a deal?

15:19.292 --> 15:20.750
- Why do you care?
Like, why--

15:20.792 --> 15:22.750
- She's not gonna open
at the Apollo tomorrow.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.083
- It's like,
why do you care what I do?

15:24.125 --> 15:25.750
Why do care about
what I'm doing on the side?

15:25.792 --> 15:27.208
Why do you make fun of
my T-shirt line and my comedy?

15:27.250 --> 15:28.958
- You getting something...
- Why are you ripping on

15:28.958 --> 15:30.417
- Like that on TV when I have--
- My best friend,

15:30.458 --> 15:31.792
who is a brilliant
stand-up comic

15:31.792 --> 15:33.083
and is extremely successful?

15:33.125 --> 15:36.458
- That was so fáááed up.
- Come on, guys.

15:36.458 --> 15:39.125
- I had heard your jokes, and I
didn't think they were original.

15:39.167 --> 15:41.125
- She does this four or five
fáááing nights a week.

15:41.125 --> 15:43.458
She's going on a USO tour.
- You are so amped up right now.

15:43.458 --> 15:45.042
- 'Cause you're a fáááing idiot.

15:45.083 --> 15:46.792
- So wait, you mean to tell me

15:46.792 --> 15:49.792
that if there's 50 people
watching her do stand-up,

15:49.833 --> 15:52.042
all 50 of those people
think she's brilliant?

15:52.083 --> 15:54.625
- Absolutely.

15:54.667 --> 15:57.458
- Her jokes that I saw on
YouTube were unoriginal.

15:57.458 --> 15:59.792
And you know what--
- You're so mean!

15:59.833 --> 16:01.750
- It's not mean!
- Rachel didn't ask for her--

16:01.792 --> 16:03.958
- And you know what...
- She was asked!

16:04.000 --> 16:06.792
- And, and, and...
- Where are your YouTube videos

16:06.833 --> 16:08.125
of your stand-up?
- I haven't heard anything

16:08.167 --> 16:09.500
you're saying, by the way.

16:09.542 --> 16:11.000
You're literally just yelling
into blank space.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.167
- Rachel despises you.
- Thank you.

16:13.208 --> 16:15.500
That's like saying a Trump
supporter despises me.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.625
And as a compliment,
then I appreciate that.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.333
Thank you.
So anyway--

16:20.333 --> 16:22.000
- That's funny.
- As I was saying--

16:22.042 --> 16:25.000
I just see so many people
work so hard

16:25.000 --> 16:26.792
to try to get their stuff seen,

16:26.833 --> 16:29.000
and for that to be filmed

16:29.000 --> 16:30.792
and put possibly
on national television,

16:30.833 --> 16:32.500
I was like,
"Well, that kinda sucks."

16:32.542 --> 16:35.458
- Well, that's the nature of--
- She's just doing something--

16:35.500 --> 16:37.333
She's having fun!
Like, she's--

16:37.375 --> 16:39.625
What, like,
why can't she do that?

16:39.667 --> 16:40.833
- I can make a comment on

16:40.833 --> 16:42.292
whatever the hell
I want to make a comment on.

16:42.333 --> 16:44.125
- But you're gonna give an
opinion that I disagree with

16:44.167 --> 16:45.458
and you're gonna rip on
one of my friends,

16:45.500 --> 16:47.958
you're gonna get it
handed right back to you.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.542
- Jax, you had a real
deep moment there with Peter.

16:51.583 --> 16:54.208
- I don't have a ton of people
in this town to talk to

16:54.250 --> 16:55.625
besides you and Tom and Tom,

16:55.667 --> 16:58.208
so for me to lose my friends
would be huge to me.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.667
- I know.
- I don't have anything else.

17:01.708 --> 17:05.125
- The thing that got you
and made you break

17:05.167 --> 17:07.375
was the idea
of losing your friends.

17:07.375 --> 17:09.542
What do your friends
mean to you?

17:09.583 --> 17:11.000
- I mean, they're everything.

17:11.042 --> 17:12.625
You know, especially these two,
Tom and Tom.

17:12.667 --> 17:15.167
I mean, they're--
if I didn't have them...

17:15.208 --> 17:16.667
Gee, I--pffft...

17:16.708 --> 17:18.042
- It's interesting, though.

17:18.042 --> 17:20.333
You're talking about
what the Toms mean to you,

17:20.375 --> 17:22.875
yet minutes before,

17:22.875 --> 17:25.875
you had kind of ratted Tom out
to Kristen

17:25.875 --> 17:28.875
about what they were saying
about the comedy show.

17:28.875 --> 17:30.167
- We were taking about
your sketch comedy

17:30.208 --> 17:32.583
before you got here, and
then when Ariana got involved,

17:32.583 --> 17:34.250
she's like, "I'm sorry,
I've been trained in sketch.

17:34.292 --> 17:36.583
I take that sháá
really seriously."

17:36.625 --> 17:40.083
- I'm not a malicious person.
I'm not.

17:40.125 --> 17:43.375
I just do a lot of stupid sháá.

17:43.417 --> 17:46.417
- Even if we did get asked
about somebody's comedy show

17:46.458 --> 17:50.542
or whatever, it's immediately
used as ammunition against us.

17:50.583 --> 17:52.375
- Do you ever think maybe
it's not ammunition.

17:52.417 --> 17:53.750
It's actually like--

17:53.792 --> 17:55.583
it's a response to the things
that you're saying?

17:55.583 --> 17:56.917
- Wow!
- Do you maybe think that

17:56.917 --> 17:58.917
we're acting in response
to the way that you guys--

17:58.958 --> 18:01.333
- Do you not see me...
- Well, when I say I'm tired--

18:01.375 --> 18:02.583
- Being quiet?
- When I say I'm tired

18:02.583 --> 18:03.667
of not pretending
there's an issue here,

18:03.708 --> 18:04.917
can we talk about it,
you go,

18:04.917 --> 18:06.083
"I'm tired of pretending
to have fun with you."

18:06.083 --> 18:07.917
I mean, okay.

18:07.958 --> 18:09.750
I've been kind of pretending

18:09.792 --> 18:11.792
like I've been having
a good time around you guys

18:11.792 --> 18:14.500
for a long time, so...

18:15.625 --> 18:17.292
- But don't say
we use it as ammunition

18:17.292 --> 18:19.875
when you say things that are
kinda fáááed up and hurtful.

18:19.917 --> 18:21.417
Okay?
So it's not ammunition.

18:21.458 --> 18:23.875
- Why isn't your ex-girlfriend
invited on your birthday trip?

18:23.917 --> 18:25.458
Like that's not fáááed up?

18:25.458 --> 18:26.792
- I don't think I--

18:26.833 --> 18:28.875
- Like, I don't want
to be married to you?

18:28.917 --> 18:30.750
Like, I made a mistake?

18:30.792 --> 18:33.375
Why didn't you take
any responsibility for that?

18:35.833 --> 18:37.958
- When Katie has a feeling,
it trumps anything

18:38.000 --> 18:40.125
and everything else.
- Exactly!

18:40.167 --> 18:42.792
- So he's not allowed
to disagree with you?

18:52.667 --> 18:56.167
Stassi wasn't the only
big return of the year.

18:56.167 --> 19:01.000
We also saw Tequila Katie again.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.625
- I started trying
to justify a little bit

19:02.667 --> 19:04.333
Ariana's behavior,
more just trying to see

19:04.333 --> 19:06.167
where she came from.
Katie just lost it.

19:06.208 --> 19:09.667
From there on out, she was rage
texting me for four hours.

19:09.708 --> 19:11.500
The bubble never stopped
for one second.

19:11.500 --> 19:15.500
- Schwartz, let me share some of
Katie's greatest hits with you.

19:15.542 --> 19:17.667
"I can't believe I thought
you were marriage material.

19:17.708 --> 19:19.667
"You should sell the ring.

19:19.667 --> 19:22.833
Thank God I'm not pregnant."

19:22.833 --> 19:24.083
- That's her warming up, man.

19:24.125 --> 19:25.333
- Really?

19:25.333 --> 19:27.333
- I'm not kidding.
- What did you do?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.167
- He called me a scumbag
and then everyone--

19:29.167 --> 19:31.250
- No, no, that's--
I-I-I was--Well, I don't know.

19:31.292 --> 19:32.833
I don't want
to get too far into it.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.125
- You were sensitive all day.
You were complaining all day.

19:35.167 --> 19:36.708
We were doing our engagement
photos and he was like,

19:36.750 --> 19:38.542
"I don't want to be here."
I'm like, can you just smile?

19:38.542 --> 19:40.208
- Because I didn't like
that they were piling on Ariana

19:40.250 --> 19:42.000
and they were getting
the gang mentality going,

19:42.042 --> 19:44.042
and then everyone
was sort of talking trash.

19:44.042 --> 19:46.125
- I wasn't even there when--
- I was just trying to see

19:46.167 --> 19:47.375
her side of the story,

19:47.417 --> 19:49.542
just trying to be a voice
of reason, big mistake.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.167
And then she went off on me,

19:51.208 --> 19:54.375
and then she tried
to make some outrageous claim

19:54.375 --> 19:55.875
that I was secretly
in love with Ariana.

19:55.917 --> 19:57.500
I was like, "You're a scumbag
for doing that."

19:57.542 --> 20:00.167
And then it just snowballed
from there.

20:00.208 --> 20:01.333
It was epic.

20:01.375 --> 20:03.875
And the good news--
- You were not--

20:03.917 --> 20:05.958
You were not nice, and all day
my feelings were hurt.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.208
And then for you to be like,

20:07.250 --> 20:08.708
"Oh, why are you
yelling at Ariana?"

20:08.708 --> 20:10.208
I'm like, "Well, I told you
what I was upset about

20:10.250 --> 20:11.542
"what she's told me,

20:11.542 --> 20:13.000
so why are you
coming to me and saying that?"

20:13.042 --> 20:14.875
You were just being completely
insensitive to my feelings.

20:14.875 --> 20:16.250
- When Katie has a feeling,

20:16.250 --> 20:18.708
it trumps anything
and everything else.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.583
- Scheana, if I'm really upset,
how do you--

20:20.583 --> 20:21.708
how do you disarm me?

20:21.750 --> 20:23.083
- Give you a hug.

20:23.125 --> 20:24.583
You just--you need
to calm her down,

20:24.583 --> 20:26.333
not fight with her,
not yell with her--

20:26.375 --> 20:28.000
- If she has a feeling--
- How do you know this?

20:28.042 --> 20:29.750
- Because we've had to do it.
- Yes.

20:29.792 --> 20:31.417
- So he's not allowed
to disagree with you?

20:31.458 --> 20:32.875
- That's essentially--yes.
- No, no, no.

20:32.917 --> 20:34.250
I'm saying when I'm getting
upset, rather than--

20:34.292 --> 20:35.750
Rather than antagonize me,
like,

20:35.750 --> 20:37.250
and egging me--
- No, no, no, no.

20:37.250 --> 20:38.750
She doesn't want
to be challenged ever

20:38.792 --> 20:40.750
when she has a feeling,
'cause that's her feeling,

20:40.750 --> 20:42.333
and that's what
matters most.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.583
She does not want
to be challenged.

20:43.625 --> 20:45.417
- She just wants to feel like
you guys are a team.

20:45.458 --> 20:47.833
- Katie, when you send
those texts,

20:47.875 --> 20:49.250
do you believe
what you're saying...

20:49.292 --> 20:50.708
- Absolutely not.
- Or do you think

20:50.750 --> 20:52.167
you're punishing him?
- No, I just want to think of

20:52.208 --> 20:53.583
the meanest thing
I can say next.

20:53.583 --> 20:54.917
- Got it.
- So just tell me right now--

20:54.958 --> 20:57.083
make it perfectly clear to me,
what do I do?

20:57.083 --> 20:59.125
- Hug her.
- They told you!

20:59.125 --> 21:00.625
- Support her!
- They just told you.

21:00.625 --> 21:03.083
- Don't try and reason
with the other side.

21:03.125 --> 21:04.458
- To end on a positive note,

21:04.458 --> 21:07.292
I want to say that as
a testament to our relationship,

21:07.292 --> 21:10.750
we were able to get over that
in a matter of, like,

21:10.792 --> 21:12.958
24 to 36 hours.

21:12.958 --> 21:14.750
I think a big part of it was,
you know,

21:14.792 --> 21:17.250
after you've seen
Lisa Vanderpump topless,

21:17.292 --> 21:19.458
like, it makes everything else
just insignificant.

21:19.458 --> 21:22.625
- What has that got to do
with anything?

21:26.625 --> 21:29.625
- Dude, I'm taking that pic.
Click.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.750
- It's going right
to the highlight reel.

21:31.792 --> 21:33.292
Dude, she's really hot.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.792
- I'll tell you
the worst thing...

21:34.792 --> 21:37.083
- Oh, that thing was glorious.
- Is they took that picture--

21:37.125 --> 21:39.292
you didn't show this--
they took that picture,

21:39.333 --> 21:40.667
and they were running
round the house...

21:40.667 --> 21:42.000
- We were running
around the house.

21:42.042 --> 21:43.500
- Pretending to jerk off
over it.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.167
- We were like--
- Ew!

21:45.167 --> 21:48.458
- When you say, "Am I doing
two jobs at once?" yeah.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.833
- No, no, no--
- I wear many hats.

21:51.875 --> 21:54.500
What are they doing?
- They had a picture of you.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.125
- What picture?
- I don't know.

21:59.833 --> 22:02.167
- That is just too much.

22:07.333 --> 22:09.000
- I was kidding...

22:09.000 --> 22:10.292
Ill-timed joke.
I'm sorry.

22:10.333 --> 22:11.583
- You did make
an ill-timed joke.

22:11.625 --> 22:14.500
- Ariana, one thing
Jax said about you and Tom

22:14.500 --> 22:17.083
was that you were withdrawing
from the group.

22:17.125 --> 22:19.333
Do you understand
why Jax would say that?

22:19.333 --> 22:21.375
- I have individual friendships
within the group,

22:21.417 --> 22:26.667
but I've never once wanted to be
a part of this group-think

22:26.708 --> 22:29.458
of like, "Well, we decided
this and we decided that"

22:29.500 --> 22:32.042
that Jax kind of lives
in that world.

22:32.083 --> 22:33.792
- Jax, you said that
Tom and Ariana

22:33.833 --> 22:36.042
were living on their own planet

22:36.042 --> 22:39.375
and that Sandoval was more fun
when he was with Kristen.

22:39.375 --> 22:41.875
- In the beginning of
Tom and Ariana's relationship,

22:41.917 --> 22:44.625
I had never seen Tom so--
he's so happy.

22:44.667 --> 22:47.833
I hate--I'm sorry.
- No, it was a major upgrade.

22:47.875 --> 22:49.375
And I fully agree.
- I just think he was such--

22:49.375 --> 22:50.667
- Anything was better than--
- Amazing.

22:50.708 --> 22:52.333
I can't believe how much
different a person he is.

22:52.375 --> 22:54.125
And then over time,
I just think

22:54.167 --> 22:56.833
he kind of distanced himself
from the group.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.542
- I think that was a really
fáááed up thing to say.

22:59.542 --> 23:01.708
And I think it's completely--
- I don't mean it in a mean way.

23:01.708 --> 23:03.917
I think you guys just choose to
do your own thing on the side.

23:03.917 --> 23:06.167
- It's not--but Jax--
- Nothing wrong with that.

23:06.208 --> 23:07.583
- Maybe you have
more access to him.

23:07.583 --> 23:09.583
- I think that's what it is.
No, no, no, no, no,

23:09.583 --> 23:11.917
you feel because he's--
- I'm still with Tom, A and B.

23:11.958 --> 23:14.167
- You're in a tight
relationship with Ariana

23:14.208 --> 23:16.542
and you feel like you've lost
your friend a little bit.

23:16.583 --> 23:18.708
There's a little bit
of competitiveness.

23:18.750 --> 23:19.917
- Yeah, maybe that's it.
- I'm not jealous.

23:19.958 --> 23:22.708
- Sorry, Jax, but you are
a little possessive.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.917
- It's not jealousy, it's just--
- You're a little possessive.

23:24.917 --> 23:27.583
- Yes, I'll say I'm possessive.
- I just feel like--

23:27.625 --> 23:30.000
I don't know,
he gets a little competitive.

23:30.042 --> 23:33.583
- Seems like Jax is unsupportive
of your music career.

23:33.583 --> 23:37.333
- Look, I know Jax well enough
to know that maybe--

23:37.375 --> 23:38.833
I don't know,
maybe he's jealous?

23:38.875 --> 23:41.167
- I wouldn't say I'm jealous.
I just say I think--

23:41.208 --> 23:43.833
I think he's the most talented
person out of this whole group.

23:43.875 --> 23:46.583
Amazing actor, musician.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.458
It's just, when he gets
something in his head,

23:48.458 --> 23:51.083
he goes full steam, hard core--
like, "I wanna be in music,"

23:51.125 --> 23:52.625
and takes it on for,
like, a month,

23:52.625 --> 23:54.375
and then it'll die down
and the next month it'll be--

23:54.417 --> 23:56.458
- Take it on for a month?
I've been playing music--

23:56.458 --> 23:58.750
I've been in three
different bands, I've, like...

23:58.792 --> 24:00.792
- I think what it is
is that Jax likes to be--

24:00.833 --> 24:02.917
sorry, but he likes
to be number one.

24:02.958 --> 24:05.583
And so when there's like a lot
of attention, say on Sandoval,

24:05.625 --> 24:07.375
I think then that's
when he's like, "Stop it."

24:07.417 --> 24:08.625
- What did you mean
when you said

24:08.667 --> 24:11.958
you're the number one guy
in the group?

24:12.000 --> 24:13.625
- Stop acting like you're
the number one fáááing guy

24:13.625 --> 24:16.750
in this group, man.

24:16.792 --> 24:18.458
I'm the number one guy
in this group.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.125
- Are you fáááing
kidding me, Jax?

24:21.125 --> 24:22.792
Fááá you, man.

24:22.833 --> 24:24.292
- Right away,
I was in the wrong.

24:24.333 --> 24:26.000
You know how you say something,
you're like, "Sháá.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.333
Why'd I say--
I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

24:27.375 --> 24:28.667
Like, right after I said it,

24:28.667 --> 24:29.958
I go, "Can we take it outside?
I'm sorry."

24:30.000 --> 24:32.667
- Schwartz had had his ass
reamed out that night,

24:32.667 --> 24:34.083
and I felt bad for him.

24:34.125 --> 24:36.167
And I just wanted to, like,
check in with my homey.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.792
And I just was like,

24:37.833 --> 24:39.583
"Jax, can you fáááing chill
with your drunk ass?"

24:39.625 --> 24:41.083
You were wasted,
and like, dude,

24:41.125 --> 24:42.625
let me have a little talk
with Schwartz

24:42.667 --> 24:46.458
and just see if he's okay and he
just, like, said what he said.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.167
- Do you even remember
saying it?

24:48.167 --> 24:49.625
- Yeah, I do,
I do remember saying it,

24:49.667 --> 24:52.833
because soon as I said it,
I knew I was in the wrong.

24:52.875 --> 24:54.333
- Let's switch gears
for a minute.

24:54.375 --> 24:56.333
I want to talk about
Palm Springs.

24:56.375 --> 24:58.833
Katie, you turned down the
invitation to go to Palm Springs

24:58.833 --> 25:02.333
but decided to surprise them.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.917
Why was the element of surprise
important to you?

25:04.958 --> 25:06.500
- I was like,
"Well, we are invited

25:06.500 --> 25:08.875
and it would be really great to
kinda catch her off guard"

25:08.875 --> 25:10.875
because I really want to see
the genuine.

25:10.875 --> 25:12.042
I want to see the authenticity,

25:12.083 --> 25:13.208
and if she doesn't know
I'm coming,

25:13.208 --> 25:15.833
I'll know pretty much
right away.

25:15.875 --> 25:18.375
Surprise, bitches.
- Hi!

25:20.333 --> 25:23.167
- Come here.

25:23.208 --> 25:25.000
Okay, come here.
Let's go talk.

25:31.708 --> 25:34.875
- So when you sat there
across from her on that couch,

25:34.875 --> 25:36.458
what was it that she said

25:36.500 --> 25:39.958
that made you feel
that she was genuine?

25:40.000 --> 25:41.708
How did she get through to you?

25:41.708 --> 25:44.042
- I wanted to ask her
why she cut me off.

25:44.083 --> 25:45.333
I needed to know

25:45.375 --> 25:46.708
because I didn't believe
the reasons before--

25:46.750 --> 25:48.125
it didn't make sense,

25:48.167 --> 25:50.250
considering I'd been
such a great friend

25:50.250 --> 25:53.417
and so close to her for so long
that me going to Miami,

25:53.417 --> 25:55.250
that was enough to end it all.

25:55.292 --> 25:56.750
- When I feel a certain way
about someone,

25:56.792 --> 26:00.083
I don't go on vacation with them
and pretend to all get along.

26:00.083 --> 26:01.250
- Okay, that's your decision.

26:01.250 --> 26:03.333
- You are the last link
to them.

26:03.375 --> 26:05.667
- To know
that she could recognize

26:05.708 --> 26:08.583
and be accountable for that
was important

26:08.583 --> 26:11.583
and also take accountability
for the fact that...

26:11.583 --> 26:13.667
I didn't deserve that,
and I was an amazing friend

26:13.708 --> 26:16.042
and just have humility.

26:16.083 --> 26:17.542
I didn't think she was
even capable of it.

26:17.583 --> 26:19.708
The fact that she did,
I was...

26:19.750 --> 26:21.583
surprised by it.

26:21.583 --> 26:23.917
- I'm really sorry.

26:23.917 --> 26:25.833
I'm really sorry.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.250
- Thank you for apologizing.

26:27.250 --> 26:28.875
I've been waiting for that

26:28.917 --> 26:31.208
for a really, really,
really, really long time.

26:31.250 --> 26:33.458
- Humility was a big selling
point for me too.

26:33.458 --> 26:35.625
Like, it was--I've said it
a bunch of times,

26:35.625 --> 26:37.125
but it was a good look
for you.

26:37.125 --> 26:38.542
- Again, it's not fun.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.333
- We'll be right back
after this.

26:43.958 --> 26:45.625
Why did you have sex with James
that night?

26:45.625 --> 26:47.042
- I tried to kind of
hear him out

26:47.083 --> 26:49.417
and then he told me he slept
with Jenna, and it was like--

26:49.458 --> 26:51.583
- And you still
took your pants off that night.

27:00.625 --> 27:02.958
Scheana, you encouraged Katie
to go see Stassi.

27:02.958 --> 27:04.792
You drove all the way
to Palm Springs.

27:04.792 --> 27:08.458
Why did you seem to become
instantaneously jealous?

27:08.500 --> 27:10.542
- All you guys are,
like, having fun

27:10.583 --> 27:11.958
and hanging out
and all friends again

27:12.000 --> 27:15.458
and I'm like, cool,
all I can think about is my--

27:15.500 --> 27:18.333
one of my "best friends,"
so I thought, like,

27:18.375 --> 27:21.417
doesn't see me that way and
doesn't fáááing like me anymore.

27:21.458 --> 27:22.958
It was insecurity.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.583
It was PTSD from the way
they used to treat me,

27:26.625 --> 27:29.417
and it just--all of those
old feelings

27:29.458 --> 27:33.750
of the three of them and me
just kind of came back.

27:33.792 --> 27:35.333
- So let's talk about Carter.

27:35.333 --> 27:36.500
How long have you been together?

27:36.542 --> 27:38.625
- We met the end of July.

27:41.542 --> 27:44.667
- And Katie had a one-night
stand with him when?

27:44.708 --> 27:46.333
- Last week.

27:46.333 --> 27:49.292
- Maybe it was Tequila Katie.
Ask her.

27:49.333 --> 27:50.667
- He's one of the first friends
I made here.

27:50.667 --> 27:52.000
Jax introduced me to Carter,

27:52.042 --> 27:54.917
and I introduced Carter to Katie
and they were like...

27:55.000 --> 27:57.042
- I think we've met before.

27:57.042 --> 27:59.375
- I mean, and this is
how mellow Schwartz is.

27:59.375 --> 28:02.542
Schwartz says
he's been inside her.

28:02.542 --> 28:04.208
- Oh!
- Ew!

28:04.208 --> 28:06.125
- He said he's had
his dááá in her.

28:06.167 --> 28:10.708
- It's like a one-night stand
haunting me.

28:10.708 --> 28:12.542
- Katie and Carter...

28:12.542 --> 28:14.167
uh, you know, how do I say this?

28:14.208 --> 28:15.625
Um...

28:15.667 --> 28:18.000
He's had his dááá in her.

28:19.250 --> 28:20.333
- I never said penis.

28:20.375 --> 28:22.500
- You're so progressive.

28:23.750 --> 28:25.875
- Kristen, you're the most
inquisitive,

28:25.875 --> 28:28.958
up-in-your-business person
in this group.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.500
Are we really meant to believe
that you didn't know

28:31.542 --> 28:34.042
that this guy had had
a one-night stand with Katie

28:34.083 --> 28:35.625
before you started dating him?

28:35.667 --> 28:37.208
- Carter and I met
on a dating app.

28:37.250 --> 28:39.375
Stassi was staying with me,
and I was like,

28:39.417 --> 28:41.167
"Oh, look at this guy,
blah, blah, blah."

28:41.208 --> 28:42.833
Stassi was like,
"Oh, my God."

28:42.875 --> 28:44.917
She's like,
"Kristen, we all know him.

28:44.917 --> 28:46.208
He was a waiter at,,,
- The Hudson.

28:46.250 --> 28:47.417
- Yeah, this bar The Hudson.

28:47.417 --> 28:48.542
- We used to say,
"Hot guy from Hudson."

28:48.583 --> 28:50.083
- Hot guy from Hudson.

28:50.083 --> 28:51.250
- I couldn't remember
if you knew or not,

28:51.250 --> 28:52.750
but then she's like,
"Do you mind?"

28:52.750 --> 28:54.542
I'm like, "Do I mind?"
Did we not talk about this?

28:54.583 --> 28:56.750
- Is she gonna care?
Like, she's engaged.

28:56.750 --> 28:58.833
She doesn't care.

28:58.875 --> 29:00.542
- It's like that girl,
like, you don't...

29:00.583 --> 29:02.083
go after someone
your friend hooked up with.

29:02.083 --> 29:03.542
- Well, what's interesting
is that--

29:04.792 --> 29:06.583
- Someone's one to talk.

29:06.583 --> 29:08.250
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

29:08.292 --> 29:10.083
- Kristen!
Listen, just stop talking.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.250
You know what I mean?

29:13.458 --> 29:15.750
- Nice that everybody
can laugh about it.

29:15.750 --> 29:18.125
I think I'm the most upset
in this room.

29:18.167 --> 29:21.250
- No, me too, it's just like,
I'm really thinking about it,

29:21.292 --> 29:22.583
and they don't give a sháá.

29:22.625 --> 29:25.250
- You know, shortly after
you started dating Carter,

29:25.292 --> 29:28.250
you agreed to have a drink
with James.

29:28.292 --> 29:29.292
- Been waiting for this.

29:29.333 --> 29:32.125
- Why did you agree to meet up

29:32.125 --> 29:35.125
with the guy who spat on
your door, called you names,

29:35.167 --> 29:37.625
and you say
treated you so horribly?

29:37.667 --> 29:39.292
- He did.
He did treat me really horribly.

29:39.333 --> 29:42.375
But at the end of the day,
like, I saw so much of,

29:42.417 --> 29:44.458
like, my old self in him

29:44.500 --> 29:46.125
and just this horrible
downward spiral

29:46.125 --> 29:48.625
and I'm like,
"Uh, if I can just fix him.

29:48.625 --> 29:50.458
"If I can just show him, like,

29:50.458 --> 29:51.958
"don't follow the path
that I did,

29:51.958 --> 29:53.125
'cause yours is actually
much worse."

29:53.167 --> 29:54.583
- Oh, shut up.

29:54.625 --> 29:57.625
- Yet, you slept with him
while you were dating Carter.

29:57.625 --> 29:59.292
- Carter and I
weren't dating yet--

29:59.333 --> 30:01.500
- Yeah, you were.
Yeah, you were.

30:01.542 --> 30:03.000
- You called him
your boyfriend.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
I don't know--
- No, I didn't.

30:05.042 --> 30:08.000
I just don't want
to disrespect Carter.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.667
The best thing about Carter
is that he's smarter than me

30:11.667 --> 30:13.000
and he has perfect measurements.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Total boyfriend material.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.833
- No, but you made me promise

30:16.875 --> 30:18.667
not to tell any of your friends
for the longest time--

30:18.708 --> 30:20.167
- You were trying
to blackmail me--

30:20.167 --> 30:21.250
- No, I didn't try
to blackmail--

30:21.292 --> 30:22.667
Babe, it's hardly blackmail.

30:22.708 --> 30:25.667
We had sex after we'd worked
together for over a year.

30:25.667 --> 30:27.667
- Why did you have sex
with James that night?

30:27.667 --> 30:29.625
- That night, I tried
to kind of hear him out,

30:29.667 --> 30:31.458
and then he told me
he slept with Jenna.

30:31.500 --> 30:33.833
Did you sleep with Jenna?

30:33.875 --> 30:35.792
- Yeah.

30:35.833 --> 30:37.625
I told you that.
- No, you didn't.

30:37.667 --> 30:38.958
- Really?

30:39.000 --> 30:41.167
Well, yeah, I did.

30:43.208 --> 30:46.042
- It was just, like,
a ton of bricks--

30:46.083 --> 30:47.208
- And you still took your pants
off that night.

30:47.250 --> 30:49.000
- How stupid am I to,
like, not realize--

30:49.042 --> 30:50.000
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus.

30:50.042 --> 30:51.458
- That's disgusting.
- Stop!

30:51.500 --> 30:53.042
- "So disgusting."
- It is!

30:53.083 --> 30:54.375
- It just shifted thing for me.

30:54.375 --> 30:55.667
- No, but it's a true story,
Scheana.

30:55.708 --> 30:57.208
True story.
- But it's still disgusting.

30:57.250 --> 30:59.333
Over the hood on her Beemer.
- You don't need to say sháá

30:59.375 --> 31:00.708
like that--you don't need to...
- So disgusting.

31:00.708 --> 31:02.208
Stop.
- Say stuff in that way.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.875
- Calm down.
- Oh, God.

31:06.542 --> 31:09.333
- So why after all the horrible
things you had said about her

31:09.375 --> 31:13.042
did you want to pursue her
again and sleep with her?

31:13.042 --> 31:14.375
- You know, honestly,

31:14.375 --> 31:15.875
it's--it's a confusing time
for me to, like,

31:15.917 --> 31:17.208
go back and think about.

31:17.208 --> 31:18.708
You know, I have, like--

31:18.708 --> 31:21.000
Obviously, now I wish
that never happened and, uh--

31:21.042 --> 31:23.333
- You and I both, James,
but you gotta think about it.

31:23.375 --> 31:25.750
- Hold on, did I--did I--
did I interrupt you, like--

31:25.792 --> 31:27.750
- Yes, you did.
- Yes.

31:27.750 --> 31:29.083
- Nah, I didn't.

31:29.083 --> 31:30.208
- I'm just wondering
if you guys felt like there was

31:30.250 --> 31:32.208
a little foundation there
or something?

31:32.250 --> 31:35.000
- Dude, I mean,
we were together for a year--

31:35.042 --> 31:36.333
- That's what it--yeah.

31:36.375 --> 31:37.833
Because once he started
being sweet, he basically--

31:37.875 --> 31:39.750
He drove me home,
'cause I had taken an Uber,

31:39.750 --> 31:41.750
and then it was like
listening to music--

31:41.750 --> 31:43.167
All the things that he had said,

31:43.208 --> 31:44.750
like, why we fell in love,

31:44.750 --> 31:46.000
listening to music
till 6:00 a.m.,

31:46.042 --> 31:48.250
like, talking, like--just that--

31:48.292 --> 31:50.375
- Then you had sex
on top of the car?

31:50.417 --> 31:51.958
- Is that part really true?

31:53.917 --> 31:55.375
- In public?
- No, it was--

31:55.417 --> 31:57.250
No, it was standing up
on the side of it.

31:57.250 --> 31:59.375
You had your hands on the hood.
I remember.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.042
- Ew.

32:01.083 --> 32:03.167
- We couldn't go upstairs
'cause you were in bed, Stassi.

32:03.208 --> 32:05.625
It's true!
- Stop being so ratchet.

32:05.625 --> 32:07.083
Like, stop it.
- I know.

32:07.125 --> 32:08.958
I'm just telling the truth.
I'm not ratchet.

32:08.958 --> 32:10.458
- I have admitted
that I slept with you

32:10.458 --> 32:11.792
and it was a huge mistake.
- I know, but you're saying

32:11.833 --> 32:13.208
it's inside the car.
Your car's a 1 Series.

32:13.250 --> 32:14.958
It could have hardly worked out.

32:14.958 --> 32:17.625
I was so embarrassed.

32:17.625 --> 32:20.125
And then it was after that--

32:20.125 --> 32:22.292
after it happened and I had to
tell Carter about it

32:22.333 --> 32:24.375
and really, like, digest it,

32:24.417 --> 32:28.125
it was like, "Okay, I know that
I want to be with Carter."

32:28.125 --> 32:31.042
- Let's talk about Katie
and Tom's engagement party.

32:31.083 --> 32:33.417
Lisa, you were kind enough
to open your home

32:33.458 --> 32:38.625
on the condition that Stassi
and Kristen not be invited.

32:38.667 --> 32:41.292
- I do not want
Stassi or Kristen.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.625
Really,
don't push me on this.

32:43.625 --> 32:45.958
I didn't want a problem
with them at Katie's party.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.583
I didn't want to ruin that,
so...

32:48.625 --> 32:51.792
I suppose when they showed up,
I had to put my feelings aside.

32:51.833 --> 32:53.333
- Honestly, I was like--

32:53.333 --> 32:54.667
I had a feeling
that she would want to,

32:54.667 --> 32:56.417
but maybe Stassi
could persuade her not to,

32:56.458 --> 32:57.833
'cause I know
that's not Stassi's style

32:57.833 --> 32:59.083
to show up uninvited.

32:59.125 --> 33:00.333
- I mean, let's be honest,

33:00.333 --> 33:02.167
I could have kept them out
if I really wanted to.

33:02.167 --> 33:03.583
I could have said, "Okay,
put somebody on the door."

33:03.625 --> 33:06.333
- I know the code to that gate.

33:06.333 --> 33:07.958
- You know,
I could have done.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
- And then Kristen, you, uh,
who were not invited

33:11.042 --> 33:12.333
gave a speech.

33:12.333 --> 33:14.667
- I wasn't there
for the actual engagement.

33:14.667 --> 33:16.833
I hadn't seen Katie's family
in so long,

33:16.875 --> 33:18.667
and I introduced them.

33:18.708 --> 33:20.000
So I was like--

33:20.000 --> 33:23.125
- It was a little winded,
but it was heartfelt.

33:23.167 --> 33:25.958
- Lala, you seemed
a little bit drunk at the party.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.125
- A little bit?

33:27.167 --> 33:28.208
Are we watching
the same episode?

33:28.250 --> 33:29.167
I was alotabit.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.208
- She said what
I was thinking as well.

33:31.250 --> 33:33.958
- I mean, I think I said
what everybody was thinking.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.125
- That's literally what it was,
like, I'm sorry I played Cupid.

33:37.167 --> 33:39.042
- Can we wrap it up?

33:39.083 --> 33:40.667
What the fááá
are you talking about?

33:40.708 --> 33:41.833
- Don't say, "Wrap it up."

33:41.875 --> 33:43.500
- Wrap it up. Wrap it up.
Wrap it up.

33:43.542 --> 33:46.375
- That's ghetto as sháá.

33:46.375 --> 33:48.042
- I was kinda thinking
that too a little bit.

33:48.042 --> 33:49.625
- But what about
what I was thinking?

33:49.667 --> 33:50.875
- I was not raised like that,

33:50.917 --> 33:53.208
and I am very embarrassed
that I would do that,

33:53.208 --> 33:55.875
but when I start having anxiety
about something,

33:55.875 --> 33:57.292
I'm like, "Oh, my gosh."

33:57.333 --> 34:00.625
Like, I need to, like,
rip my skin off.

34:00.667 --> 34:02.375
- The speech
was making you anxious?

34:02.417 --> 34:04.208
- It doesn't matter.
Would you go to a wedding--

34:04.250 --> 34:06.167
I mean...come on.

34:06.208 --> 34:08.167
- No, you wouldn't.

34:08.208 --> 34:09.833
- I felt like people
didn't like her and--

34:09.875 --> 34:11.417
- There were parents there.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.042
There was grandmothers there.
- That's really what it was.

34:13.083 --> 34:14.250
- It was out of line.

34:14.250 --> 34:15.667
- Yeah, I just think
you didn't like Kristen,

34:15.708 --> 34:17.000
so, like, that's it.

34:17.042 --> 34:18.208
- I think I speak for everybody
when I said,

34:18.250 --> 34:20.583
we weren't so upset
about the interruption,

34:20.583 --> 34:22.917
we were more upset
about your hair.

34:25.917 --> 34:28.375
- All right,
we'll be right back from Sur.

34:29.708 --> 34:30.875
- Jax, you're jealous, mate.

34:30.917 --> 34:31.875
I've said it once,
I'll say it again.

34:31.917 --> 34:33.208
- Jealous?
Are you kidding?

34:33.250 --> 34:34.875
- I'll punch you
in your fat throat, mate.

34:34.917 --> 34:36.375
- Shut up!

34:46.208 --> 34:51.042
so you all decided
to keep the party going at Sur.

34:51.083 --> 34:52.458
Lala, what was
going through your head

34:52.458 --> 34:54.583
when you shoved Kirsten?

34:54.625 --> 34:56.458
- Sit the fááá down.

34:56.500 --> 34:58.625
Sit the fááá down.
- All right, all right.

34:58.667 --> 35:01.208
No, no, no, no, no, no,
we're not doing that.

35:01.250 --> 35:02.625
We're not doing that.

35:02.667 --> 35:05.917
- I don't think I've ever been
that intoxicated.

35:05.958 --> 35:08.750
I apologized to her over texts
saying that I was sorry,

35:08.792 --> 35:11.792
and I still genuinely mean that
I am very sorry for doing that.

35:11.792 --> 35:13.292
- And I accept your apology.

35:13.333 --> 35:15.292
- And even though
we don't connect, Katie,

35:15.333 --> 35:16.750
I apologize for that too.

35:16.792 --> 35:19.583
I know there's nothing really
that I can do, but...

35:19.625 --> 35:21.958
another not-so-proud moment
for Lala.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.708
- James, at Katie and Schwartz's
engagement,

35:24.750 --> 35:28.458
you bragged about not drinking.
You seemed--

35:28.500 --> 35:30.125
- I wasn't drinking.
I ate lots of brownies.

35:30.125 --> 35:33.000
- You had four pot brownies
and smoked two joints.

35:33.042 --> 35:34.792
- If you want the truth,
I am very stoned

35:34.833 --> 35:36.125
and I feel like
I'm in space right now

35:36.167 --> 35:38.083
and I honestly feel
like I'm not even here.

35:38.125 --> 35:40.333
I am on a space level.

35:40.333 --> 35:42.833
- James, what's your medical
marijuana prescription for?

35:42.833 --> 35:44.083
What's your illness?

35:44.125 --> 35:46.000
- Um, uh...

35:46.042 --> 35:49.333
sleep disorder, eating disorder,
glaucoma--

35:49.333 --> 35:53.000
Oh, and ADHD too, helps me focus
when I make music.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.667
- Post traumatic stress
from Vietnam.

35:54.667 --> 35:56.792
- No, just focusing.
Just focusing.

35:56.833 --> 35:58.083
- Jax, so what is it?

35:58.125 --> 35:59.917
What's the anger about
with James?

35:59.958 --> 36:01.167
- How much time do we have?

36:03.458 --> 36:06.000
Just some of the things
you say out loud and the way--

36:06.000 --> 36:08.333
the way you do talk to women
and the things that you say,

36:08.333 --> 36:11.667
just like, you know, you want
to be part of the group,

36:11.667 --> 36:12.917
and then you're like,
"What do I have to do?"

36:12.958 --> 36:14.250
Well, you--you just need to--

36:14.292 --> 36:16.500
we're all 30-plus--
well, some of us.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.208
So, I mean, you want--
- Speak for yourself.

36:18.208 --> 36:19.875
- You're gonna hang out
with people that are 30-plus,

36:19.875 --> 36:22.292
you gotta act 30-plus.
- You guys don't really act--

36:22.333 --> 36:25.333
- Do you act 30-plus?
- No, not all the time, but...

36:25.375 --> 36:26.875
- Jax, you're jealous, mate.

36:26.875 --> 36:28.667
I've said it once, I'll say it
again till the day I die.

36:28.708 --> 36:30.542
- Jealous of you?
- What's he jealous of?

36:30.542 --> 36:32.375
- Jealous? Are you kidding?
- Don't worry about it.

36:32.375 --> 36:33.708
I'm not going into detail.

36:33.708 --> 36:35.000
And all of you
can come against me.

36:35.042 --> 36:37.167
- What am I jealous of?
- Just opportunity, mate.

36:37.208 --> 36:38.542
- What?
I don't want to be a DJ.

36:38.542 --> 36:40.042
I don't want to push buttons
on a computer.

36:40.042 --> 36:41.333
I don't want to do that.

36:41.375 --> 36:42.708
- Dude, when your veins start
coming out of your neck,

36:42.750 --> 36:44.875
I get freaked out.
- And you should be.

36:44.875 --> 36:46.542
- What are you gonna do?
I'm waiting for it, mate.

36:46.542 --> 36:48.042
- It's gonna happen.
It's gonna happen.

36:48.042 --> 36:49.875
- Oh, really?
- Yes, I swear--

36:49.875 --> 36:51.125
- And then I will knock you out

36:51.167 --> 36:52.333
quicker than you can
fáááing blink.

36:52.375 --> 36:54.167
I'll punch you
in your fat throat, mate.

36:54.208 --> 36:56.042
- Shut up!

36:56.042 --> 36:58.083
- You guys are never
gonna fight.

36:58.083 --> 37:00.333
It's never gonna fáááing happen.

37:00.375 --> 37:01.708
- I do think they're gonna
have sex though.

37:01.750 --> 37:03.333
- Why do you think
he's jealous of you?

37:03.375 --> 37:05.583
- They should have sex.
They should just bang it out.

37:05.625 --> 37:07.083
- James--
- Listen, I just think--

37:07.125 --> 37:09.375
I've got ten times more talent
in the bag

37:09.417 --> 37:10.750
than this guy
could ever dream of.

37:10.792 --> 37:12.250
- I thought you were
the white Kanye West.

37:12.250 --> 37:13.750
- Fááá yeah, I am.

37:13.792 --> 37:15.417
- You're not
the white Kanye West, dude.

37:15.458 --> 37:17.417
- I'm trying to do Coachella
once day and Big Think.

37:17.417 --> 37:20.750
- Coachella is not--
- Why, I can't dream, Katie?

37:20.792 --> 37:22.917
Let's see how far pucker
and pout's gonna take you.

37:22.917 --> 37:24.375
Fáááing idiots.

37:24.417 --> 37:26.583
- No one takes you seriously,
James, and no one ever will.

37:26.583 --> 37:28.500
- All right, guys.
- Aw, you guys are so upset.

37:28.542 --> 37:30.250
- James...
- No, you're a joke.

37:30.250 --> 37:32.083
You're a fáááing joke.
- That's why I'm being

37:32.125 --> 37:33.750
talked about most this reunion.

37:33.750 --> 37:35.750
- Because you're a joke.
That's why everyone's talking.

37:35.750 --> 37:37.583
- They're making fun of you.
- No, come on now.

37:37.583 --> 37:39.125
- Scheana, let's not talk about
who's a joke, babe.

37:39.125 --> 37:41.125
Let's not talk about
who's a fáááing joke.

37:41.125 --> 37:43.125
God, they all go ham on me,
dude.

37:43.125 --> 37:44.542
- Why do you dislike Jax
so much?

37:44.583 --> 37:46.750
- I don't!
You've just never liked me.

37:46.792 --> 37:48.917
Therefore, I can't like someone
that doesn't like me.

37:48.958 --> 37:51.375
- He digs at him
all the time though.

37:51.417 --> 37:53.125
- Let's just be mad
and, you know,

37:53.125 --> 37:54.417
I'll put some boxing gloves on
and let's do it.

37:54.458 --> 37:57.042
- I would love to see--
- Let's go, old man!

37:57.083 --> 37:59.250
I'm fáááing ready, mate.
- See, "Old man."

37:59.292 --> 38:00.917
That's the only thing you have.

38:00.958 --> 38:02.917
- God, you sound like
such a pussy right now.

38:02.958 --> 38:04.125
- Pussy?
- You know what?

38:04.125 --> 38:06.208
You don't need to put down
anybody else.

38:06.250 --> 38:07.625
- Then why are they
putting me down?

38:07.625 --> 38:08.958
- Because you're being
an assáááá.

38:08.958 --> 38:10.792
- You're an assáááá, Stassi.

38:10.833 --> 38:14.125
You're a fááá assáááá.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.250
- You're all fáááing assáááá.
All of you are assáááá.

38:16.292 --> 38:18.625
- James, stop it.

38:18.625 --> 38:21.000
- Assáááá, assáááá,
assáááá, assáááá!

38:21.042 --> 38:22.958
No you, not you, Schwartz.
- This is why everyone--

38:23.000 --> 38:24.833
- I'd never call you an assáááá.

38:24.833 --> 38:26.500
- This is why you're gonna
get your ass beaten.

38:26.542 --> 38:28.417
- Just talk to Kate
after you're done with them.

38:28.458 --> 38:30.167
- Oh, my God.

38:30.167 --> 38:32.500
- This is like the ultimate,
who has the bigger dick--

38:32.500 --> 38:34.292
- This is the funniest fáááing
reunion I've ever been on.

38:34.333 --> 38:36.625
- There's only one person here
that's been with you both.

38:36.667 --> 38:38.458
I think that Kristen
should tell us--

38:40.708 --> 38:42.500
- Andy!

38:42.500 --> 38:44.167
- Oh, my God.

38:44.167 --> 38:45.333
- Don't answer that.

38:45.375 --> 38:47.125
- Stassi,
at the end of the night,

38:47.167 --> 38:49.500
Jax sat down to have
a conversation with you.

38:49.500 --> 38:51.417
What was it like
after all this time,

38:51.458 --> 38:53.667
sitting down with him in Sur
and chatting?

38:53.667 --> 38:55.000
- It was honestly kind of weird

38:55.042 --> 38:57.917
because so much time has passed
and we're so different.

38:57.958 --> 39:01.000
- Your intentions seem
to lie somewhere between, uh,

39:01.000 --> 39:04.375
making peace and telling Stassi
she wasn't welcome anymore.

39:04.417 --> 39:06.792
- At that point, I just wanted
everyone to be back to--

39:06.833 --> 39:08.875
I like it when we're like this.
I do.

39:08.875 --> 39:10.208
Minus those two.

39:10.250 --> 39:12.375
I know it's toxic
and I know it's crazy, but...

39:12.375 --> 39:13.542
we do have a good time.

39:13.542 --> 39:15.833
You know,
it's water under the bridge,

39:15.875 --> 39:18.500
and like I said,
if they forgive me all the time,

39:18.542 --> 39:20.042
why can't they forgive Stassi?

39:20.042 --> 39:21.708
- Stassi, you gave Jax advice

39:21.750 --> 39:23.875
for how to make it work
with Brittney.

39:23.875 --> 39:26.958
Uh, why is she a better match
for Jax than you were?

39:27.000 --> 39:28.042
- I love her.

39:28.042 --> 39:29.500
She's basically, like,

39:29.542 --> 39:32.042
I feel like everything
I wish I was as a southern girl.

39:32.042 --> 39:34.667
And like, I didn't get, like,
any of that when I was raised.

39:34.708 --> 39:37.833
She's very gracious
and accepting,

39:37.875 --> 39:40.708
but also firm,
and she's just kind.

39:40.708 --> 39:42.375
He needs somebody
that's really kind,

39:42.375 --> 39:45.250
and I couldn't bring that
to the table.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.750
- That's funny.

39:46.750 --> 39:50.083
So, James,
after that finale night,

39:50.083 --> 39:52.417
you left, sir,
and you and Lala

39:52.458 --> 39:54.750
wound up going home to...

39:54.750 --> 39:55.917
hang out.

39:55.917 --> 39:56.917
- Yeah.

39:58.458 --> 40:00.500
Oy, are you all right, babe?

40:04.083 --> 40:05.542
- Don't let them annoy you,
yeah?

40:05.583 --> 40:07.667
- No, I'm over it.

40:07.708 --> 40:08.750
- Just out of curiosity,
I'm not put--

40:08.792 --> 40:09.917
not to put you guys
on the spot--

40:09.958 --> 40:11.917
have you guys ever had sex?
I'm not--

40:11.958 --> 40:13.917
- Yeah, we did once.
- Uh, yeah, we did once.

40:13.958 --> 40:15.500
- I was always curious.
Just...

40:15.542 --> 40:16.750
- But it didn't happen again?

40:16.750 --> 40:17.750
No.

40:17.750 --> 40:19.208
- She saw the size of his dick.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.750
- See, you're making digs too.

40:20.750 --> 40:22.083
- Are you surprised that they
went home together that night?

40:22.125 --> 40:23.417
- And you don't expect him
to respond to that?

40:23.417 --> 40:24.417
- I'm just saying.
She probably was like,

40:24.417 --> 40:25.792
"Really, this is it?
- See?

40:25.792 --> 40:26.958
- I mean, I guess--
- Here, let me get a half-chub

40:27.000 --> 40:28.625
and I'll whip it out.
I promise, I will.

40:28.625 --> 40:30.042
- No, that's okay.

40:30.083 --> 40:32.458
- I just need half.
I just need half, mate.

40:32.458 --> 40:33.542
- We're too close.

40:33.583 --> 40:34.750
- Go put it on
Schwartz's shoulder.

40:34.792 --> 40:35.958
- We're in the line of fire.
Please don't.

40:35.958 --> 40:37.292
- Schwartz,
where's your shoulder, buddy?

40:37.292 --> 40:39.458
- Yeah.
- Ha ha ha...ha ha ha.

40:39.458 --> 40:41.250
- Oh, my God.

40:41.292 --> 40:43.125
- Okay, all right,
we're gonna take a break.

40:43.125 --> 40:44.333
We'll be right back.

40:52.625 --> 40:54.792
Lisa, who do you think's
gonna get engaged next?

40:54.792 --> 40:57.125
Is it gonna be Tom and Ariana?

40:57.125 --> 40:59.625
Is it gonna be Jax and Brittany?

40:59.667 --> 41:00.958
Maybe Kristen and Carter?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.042
- I think Brittany's
too good for Jax,

41:03.083 --> 41:04.792
as much as I love him.
Sorry.

41:04.792 --> 41:06.208
- She is.
- Bless you.

41:06.250 --> 41:07.625
- They're so cute.
- And, you know what,

41:07.667 --> 41:09.750
I hope that Tom asks Ariana

41:09.792 --> 41:11.833
because I think he really
wants to and really loves her,

41:11.875 --> 41:13.333
and I hope that she says yes.

41:13.375 --> 41:14.667
- Maybe in the next year

41:14.708 --> 41:16.792
we're looking forward to
wedding bells for you two?

41:16.833 --> 41:18.125
- Yeah, it's going down.
- Yeah, as long as he--

41:18.167 --> 41:20.000
as long as he stops trying
to be the voice of reason.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Yeah.

41:21.042 --> 41:22.125
- Lisa, how do you keep

41:22.167 --> 41:24.083
all these personalities
working together?

41:24.125 --> 41:26.000
I mean, it seems like
it's getting harder and harder.

41:26.042 --> 41:27.333
- It is, actually.
- Yeah.

41:27.333 --> 41:28.667
- I think because this year

41:28.708 --> 41:31.000
it seems some of the issues
were kind of deeper.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.583
But, you know what, it's been
an amazing year, really.

41:33.625 --> 41:37.333
You've seen incredible amount
of growth from some of them,

41:37.333 --> 41:38.500
I really do think so.

41:38.542 --> 41:40.083
- Stassi, Shag, Marry, Kill:

41:40.125 --> 41:42.667
Jax, James, Sandoval.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.167
- Well, obviously,
James, you're going.

41:45.292 --> 41:46.458
And I will actually, like,

41:46.500 --> 41:47.667
I'll do it slowly,
you know what I mean?

41:47.708 --> 41:49.375
- Oh, wow.
- And, um...

41:49.375 --> 41:50.833
- How would you do it?
I'm curious.

41:50.875 --> 41:52.167
- I feel like
it would be, like,

41:52.208 --> 41:53.625
one of those, like,
acid situations.

41:53.667 --> 41:54.875
You know what I mean?

41:54.875 --> 41:56.125
Or maybe I just find out
what you're allergic to.

41:56.167 --> 41:58.042
Oh, my God.

41:58.042 --> 41:59.167
- Shag and Marry,
come on.

41:59.208 --> 42:00.708
- Honestly,
I'd probably marry Jax

42:00.750 --> 42:01.833
since I--since I--

42:01.875 --> 42:03.042
- But you've already
shagged him.

42:03.042 --> 42:04.375
Why wouldn't you just
shag him and

42:04.417 --> 42:05.708
do it one more and marry Tom?
- So I guess I need, like,

42:05.708 --> 42:07.500
another notch under my belt.
You know what I mean?

42:07.542 --> 42:08.708
It makes sense.

42:08.708 --> 42:10.708
- I'd treat you well.

42:10.750 --> 42:11.833
- He's a giver, man.

42:11.875 --> 42:13.625
- James, are you texting
right now?

42:13.667 --> 42:14.958
- We haven't talked about
the album once,

42:15.000 --> 42:16.208
and I'm upset about it.

42:16.208 --> 42:17.208
- You're kidding right now?

42:17.250 --> 42:18.542
- Oh, my God.

42:18.542 --> 42:20.000
- I would just ask.

42:20.042 --> 42:22.000
- Are you kidding me right now?

42:22.042 --> 42:23.208
- We're talking about
the album now?

42:23.250 --> 42:24.458
- No. No.
No, no, no, no.

42:24.500 --> 42:25.792
- He's trying to.
- Oh.

42:25.833 --> 42:27.042
- We're not plugging sháá.

42:27.042 --> 42:28.542
- Come on.
- You would have to pay me

42:28.583 --> 42:29.625
to listen to that.
- Guys.

42:29.667 --> 42:31.167
- Oh, my God.
- Well, in keeping with

42:31.208 --> 42:34.750
Sur tradition,
let's bring out Peter and Ken

42:34.750 --> 42:36.208
with some cocktails.

42:38.375 --> 42:39.750
- Aww!

42:39.750 --> 42:41.583
- All right,
so I made everybody a Pumptini.

42:41.583 --> 42:42.583
- Yay!
- How's everyone doing?

42:42.583 --> 42:44.250
- Yeah.
- Who's ready to get drunk?

42:44.292 --> 42:45.750
- Yeah!
- Peter!

42:45.750 --> 42:46.875
- Ladies first, ladies first,
ladies first, ladies first.

42:46.917 --> 42:48.875
- Soft...hey.
- You're so beautiful.

42:48.917 --> 42:50.583
- There's a lot of you
this time.

42:50.583 --> 42:51.583
- Want some of that?

42:51.625 --> 42:52.917
- Lisa, you want to
make a toast?

42:52.917 --> 42:55.250
- As much as a pain in the ass
all of you are,

42:55.250 --> 42:57.083
I do, actually--
bless you--

42:57.083 --> 42:58.708
love each and every one
of you.

42:58.750 --> 42:59.875
Even you, Stassi.

42:59.917 --> 43:01.083
- And you, Schnook.

43:01.083 --> 43:02.208
- And you, Schnook.

43:02.250 --> 43:03.417
And it's been
an incredible year.

43:03.417 --> 43:05.250
And I, you know, thank you

43:05.250 --> 43:06.917
for all being so honest
with your lives.

43:06.958 --> 43:08.708
Apart from you, Jax.
You're a liar.

43:08.750 --> 43:10.000
Cheers.

43:10.042 --> 43:11.542
- Cheers.
- Cheers, everybody.
