WEBVTT

00:54.096 --> 00:55.472
Wow.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.601
This is beautiful.

01:02.771 --> 01:03.897
Shit.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.025
I don't think it was recording.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.238
-Really?
-Sorry. It's these gloves.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.198
We're gonna have to do it again.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.033
-That was great though.
-Yeah.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.743
-Do it just like that.
-All right.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.186
Wow.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.190
It's beautiful.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.070
Hello.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.115
Yeah, this is she.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.671
Christ, I can't--

03:33.213 --> 03:35.174
I can't do this again.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.095
I can't-- I thought I could, and I can't.

03:45.392 --> 03:50.230
Do you know, Kelly, how long I waited
when he went down in Korea?

03:52.566 --> 03:58.155
Two weeks.
Two weeks I waited, feeling like this.

04:04.328 --> 04:05.370
I can't.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.291
Don't worry, Mom. It's gonna be okay.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.792
Nothing about this is okay.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.378
Nothing.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.401
Baldwin residence.

04:39.530 --> 04:43.617
This is his daughter. You can talk to me.

04:49.248 --> 04:50.582
Yeah.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.336
Thank you.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.895
This is what it's like, Kelly.
For the people you love.

05:11.979 --> 05:15.232
This is what it's like,
and you should know that.

05:29.413 --> 05:30.497
Dad.

05:31.415 --> 05:32.666
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:34.585 --> 05:35.586
Hi.

05:41.550 --> 05:42.885
Goodness, look at you.

05:42.968 --> 05:45.137
I just got a little wet. That's all.

05:45.220 --> 05:48.974
Look, I know it looks pretty bad,
but doc said I'm fine.

05:51.518 --> 05:57.524
Well... that's great.
You know, no harm, no foul.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.445
-Karen, I'm sorry--
-Sorry for what?

06:02.779 --> 06:05.782
It was an accident.
You know, boys will be boys.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.452
-But where are you going?
-I'm gonna go to work.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.455
It's 6:00 a.m.

06:11.538 --> 06:16.376
Yeah, I'm gonna get
an early start on the day. So...

06:19.296 --> 06:20.547
Glad you're home.

06:26.553 --> 06:27.888
Is she okay?

06:29.431 --> 06:31.183
It was a long night.

07:22.693 --> 07:23.902
Thank you. Hello.

07:23.986 --> 07:26.113
Welcome to Jamestown. Al Rossi, Commander.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.407
Hey there. Tracy. Nice to meet you.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.742
We've met before. Twice, actually.

07:31.410 --> 07:36.665
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
I'm terrible with faces.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.917
That's all right.
You've got the recognizable one.

07:41.420 --> 07:44.381
This is quite the welcome wagon
y'all put together.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.801
To be honest, I think everybody
was just hoping to get on Carson.

07:47.885 --> 07:50.095
Right. Of course.

07:50.179 --> 07:51.555
Well... say hello.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.266
But really, we couldn't be
more excited to have you, Tracy.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.895
Giving everyone on Earth a glimpse
of all the things we're doing up here,

07:57.978 --> 07:59.938
well, I think it's gonna be
great for Jamestown.

08:00.022 --> 08:02.774
I agree, sir. I'm very excited to be here.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.944
And if you don't mind,
we have a little Jamestown tradition

08:06.028 --> 08:07.946
we like to do for new arrivals.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.908
Tracy Stevens, I...

08:12.284 --> 08:13.452
Shit.

08:13.535 --> 08:17.831
...hereby christen thee
the new Linus of Jamestown.

08:18.916 --> 08:22.085
-Linus?
-You know, from Peanuts.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.088
Why am I the Linus?

08:25.172 --> 08:27.049
You're the newbie.

08:27.132 --> 08:30.177
Everybody else on your crew's
already been up here, so...

08:30.928 --> 08:32.260
Ain't that something?

08:33.222 --> 08:35.724
Okay, show's over. Let's get back to it.

08:37.601 --> 08:40.729
Hey, Nick, as your first official job
now that you're not the Linus,

08:40.812 --> 08:43.440
why don't you give the new Linus here
the standard orientation?

08:43.524 --> 08:44.816
Sure thing, chief.

08:46.777 --> 08:48.278
Hi. Hi.

08:50.572 --> 08:54.535
Now beginneth the tour
of our humble castle, my liege.

08:55.619 --> 08:58.539
Stupid. So all your power,

08:58.622 --> 09:01.583
life support, communication systems
run through here,

09:01.667 --> 09:03.752
radiate out through the various modules.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.588
And we continue.

09:06.672 --> 09:07.714
All right.

09:09.508 --> 09:15.389
This is where we do all of our research
projects. Geology, biology, chemistry.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.642
Eyewash station over there on your left,

09:18.725 --> 09:22.604
in case you get any regolith in your eye,
which you do not want to do.

09:22.688 --> 09:23.689
Trust me.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.107
That stuff gets everywhere.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.943
In your fingernails, your mouth,
your nostrils,

09:28.026 --> 09:30.112
you know, your nether regions.

09:31.947 --> 09:33.699
Don't worry. You get used to it.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.450
-All right.
-Unfortunately.

09:36.076 --> 09:42.332
Gerald is our resident chemist,
and Gerald here makes a mean moonshine.

09:46.128 --> 09:48.297
We allowed to have booze here?

09:48.380 --> 09:51.049
Well, it's generally frowned upon,

09:51.133 --> 09:54.553
but, you know, sometimes you just
need a little nip after a long day,

09:54.636 --> 09:55.888
if you know what I mean.

09:55.971 --> 09:58.891
Yeah. I think I'll be all right,
but thank you.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.559
Nice to meet you, Gerald.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.439
Okay. Great.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.442
Yeah. Don't mind him.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.902
All the chemists are kinda weird.

10:09.985 --> 10:12.446
I think it's 'cause they almost
never get to go outside.

10:13.447 --> 10:16.658
And this is the brains
of the base. Ops/Comm.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.746
Wow, this looks bigger
than I thought it would.

10:20.829 --> 10:25.459
Yeah. Everyone says that at first.
Just wait a couple weeks.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.504
This is Commander Rossi's quarters,
right here.

10:28.587 --> 10:31.840
Other side is the med bay
and quartermaster.

10:31.924 --> 10:35.302
So, if you bump your head,
need extra TP, that's your spot.

10:37.262 --> 10:41.517
Behind me, we got our construction
and mining operations.

10:41.600 --> 10:45.771
Tuzell and Petersen run a pretty mean
poker game on Friday nights.

10:46.355 --> 10:47.814
That's good to know.

10:47.898 --> 10:52.986
I'm not too shabby myself. I actually
cleaned up off my crew last week.

10:53.529 --> 10:56.865
Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure
Petersen's a cheat, so be careful.

10:56.949 --> 10:59.117
Last week,
he won Eric's whole ration of lasagna.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.538
Scary Eric.

11:02.621 --> 11:06.250
So, back here, we got LSAM
Flight Operations Control and EVA Ops.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.253
As one of our LSAM pilots,
you'll be gabbing with them a lot.

11:09.336 --> 11:13.006
This is Julie. She'll mainly be
your CAPCOM, and that's Mark.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.758
Good to see ya. Hey, Mark.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.845
Paul, I think--

11:17.928 --> 11:20.097
I think we've got enough
for Mr. de Cordova. Thank you.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.181
Sure thing.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.101
And onward we go.

11:28.772 --> 11:33.193
So, what is Johnny like, by the way?

11:34.278 --> 11:36.363
He's the best.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.491
I knew it. And what about Ed?
Is he really...

11:39.575 --> 11:42.661
-Is he really drunk all the time?
-No. That's just coffee in his cup.

11:42.744 --> 11:45.163
I knew it. I knew he was a good guy.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.542
You know,

11:48.959 --> 11:53.714
I didn't wanna admit this earlier, but
when I was a senior in high school,

11:53.797 --> 11:56.884
I saw you save Molly Cobb on TV.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.679
Well, now I feel old.

12:00.762 --> 12:04.975
No. Please. You're not. It's...

12:06.268 --> 12:08.187
It changed my life.

12:08.896 --> 12:13.400
I remember thinking to myself,
"One day, I'm gonna be her."

12:15.777 --> 12:19.656
I mean, you know, figuratively speaking,
of course, 'cause I'm not--

12:19.740 --> 12:22.034
-Of course.
-I'm not-- Yeah.

12:22.117 --> 12:23.785
Thank you, Nick.

12:25.287 --> 12:26.371
No problem.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.585
Onward to mod 1.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.546
Three channels on TV.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.840
Unfortunately, the person
with the most moon time in the room

12:36.924 --> 12:38.300
gets to pick the show.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.968
Sorry, Linus.

12:40.052 --> 12:41.762
Call me Tracy.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.514
Okay.

12:44.097 --> 12:48.644
MREs are in here. Restocked every two
weeks from the unmanned cargo launches.

12:48.727 --> 12:53.607
The lasagna goes fast, and I'd definitely
stay away from the lentils if I were you.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.819
So, this was the old Jamestown Base.

12:58.570 --> 13:02.699
Yeah. It's where it all started.
Hard to believe, isn't it?

13:05.410 --> 13:09.414
Anyway, make sure to throw out
your trash in the receptacles right here.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.960
-Got a bit of an ant infestation problem.
-Infestation?

13:13.043 --> 13:14.294
Yeah, you'll get used to it.

13:15.379 --> 13:19.341
You wanna make a call, you
sign up right there, you get 15 minutes.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.970
That's it? When Gordo was up here,
it was a whole bureaucratic thing.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.388
It used to drive me crazy.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.516
Yeah, now it's just a regular old phone.
Call whoever you want.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.059
You got Johnny's number?

13:29.977 --> 13:32.855
Just kidding. Come on.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.398
I'll show you where you sleep.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.497
You're on shift A.

13:50.581 --> 13:53.834
That's the good one. Trust me.
In bunk three. Here.

13:55.043 --> 13:58.088
Locker is all yours. Normally, you'd have
to share it with your hot rack partner.

13:58.172 --> 13:59.173
Hot rack?

13:59.256 --> 14:01.049
Yeah, not enough beds on base
for all of us.

14:01.133 --> 14:02.634
The eight crew that work the night shift

14:02.718 --> 14:04.845
have to share bunks
with the most recent arrivals.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.430
That sounds awful.

14:06.972 --> 14:09.683
It kind of is,
but you don't have to worry about that

14:09.766 --> 14:13.562
'cause Commander Rossi thought
it'd be better if you had your own space.

14:13.645 --> 14:14.855
It's good to be queen.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.692
-Tell him I appreciate it.
-Will do.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.487
We can't smoke in here, right?

14:22.571 --> 14:26.992
Yeah. But... can still use my imagination.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.412
Right. Right. Okay.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.914
What is that?

14:31.997 --> 14:34.875
That's just the air ventilation system.

14:34.958 --> 14:38.587
Like everything else,
you'll... get used to it.

14:39.755 --> 14:42.132
Come on. Let's go meet
your LSAM crew chief.

14:46.803 --> 14:50.432
Slippery little bastard.
Ain't gonna save you though.

14:50.516 --> 14:52.309
Check this out, cheese dick.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.894
Oh, no, you don't.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.438
Sorry, sailor. Saw that coming.

14:56.522 --> 14:59.608
Time to eat your lunch. Pipper's on...

14:59.691 --> 15:01.109
Fox two.

15:01.193 --> 15:03.779
That's all she wrote, buddy.

15:05.197 --> 15:06.782
Geez.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.160
We call that a clean kill.

15:10.244 --> 15:12.579
We call that dumb luck, Gordo.

15:12.663 --> 15:18.085
Let's make it two out of three.
That's not good. Warning tone.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.711
Jesus, Ed, you're on fire.

15:19.795 --> 15:21.797
You got flames under your left engine.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.257
Shit!

15:23.966 --> 15:25.467
You better get out and walk, buddy.

15:25.551 --> 15:26.969
More like go for a swim--

15:31.056 --> 15:33.016
Well, that is one hell of a show.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.686
Whose idea was it?

15:35.769 --> 15:36.812
Don't look at him.

15:36.895 --> 15:37.980
Don't look at him.

15:39.731 --> 15:43.443
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't pull both your tickets.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.238
I take full responsibility for--

15:46.321 --> 15:48.407
Since when? For anything?

15:48.490 --> 15:49.658
-Molly, listen.
-Sit down.

15:51.702 --> 15:53.996
Now, I decide who gets to go up and when.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.875
-Molly, you can't--
-I can, Ed.

15:59.334 --> 16:02.212
You were stupid. Both of you.

16:05.299 --> 16:07.467
-Molly--
-Fuck up one more time...

16:11.054 --> 16:12.139
Never gonna happen.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.223
I promise you.

16:13.307 --> 16:15.392
Then get out of here. Scram.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.560
Yes, ma'am.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.198
-That's it?
-What?

16:29.281 --> 16:31.408
That was barely a slap on the wrist.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.827
We can't just let them get away
with this kind of behavior.

16:33.911 --> 16:36.622
I don't care if it's Ed Baldwin
or Charles goddamn Lindbergh.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.290
Things got away from him.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.292
Happens all the time. It's no big deal.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.503
Not a big deal?

16:42.586 --> 16:45.339
Those jets cost over
$2 million a pop, Cobb.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.299
You wanna tell the president
that's no big deal?

16:47.382 --> 16:49.760
-I'd be happy to.
-I bet you just would.

16:49.843 --> 16:50.928
Molly.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.764
I know you and Ed are close,

16:53.847 --> 16:57.017
but I think it would be prudent
as you're getting started in this job

16:57.100 --> 17:01.772
to set a certain tone and--

17:01.855 --> 17:05.858
I'm in charge of the Astronaut Office now.
Is that correct?

17:07.027 --> 17:09.363
Yes. That's correct.

17:10.113 --> 17:13.406
All right. So the way I see it,
for the next few months,

17:14.242 --> 17:15.536
these are my people.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.748
And I will handle them as I see fit.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.458
They're pilots,

17:21.540 --> 17:23.210
not desk jockeys.

17:23.291 --> 17:26.046
Things happen. Not everything
goes according to plan.

17:26.127 --> 17:30.342
Things happen. That's a great attitude.
Maybe that should be NASA's new slogan.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.015
I don't have to justify myself
to either of you.

17:39.518 --> 17:41.103
Have a great day!

18:25.314 --> 18:28.442
Propulsion system training
has been moved to the...

19:07.356 --> 19:08.357
Fuck ye--

19:45.185 --> 19:46.270
Pretty cool, huh?

19:47.855 --> 19:50.274
Yeah, it's cool.

19:52.860 --> 19:57.322
So... why don't you tell me
a little bit about yourself, "Alieda"?

19:58.240 --> 20:00.075
-Aleida.
-Aleida.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.412
Right. All right, tell me your story.

20:05.831 --> 20:08.125
Yeah, I don't really have a story.

20:10.085 --> 20:11.170
Well...

20:12.713 --> 20:15.215
how did you wind up here
with us at Apollo-Soyuz?

20:17.509 --> 20:18.760
It's not that interesting.

20:20.137 --> 20:23.348
Over a hundred applicants and you
come out of nowhere to grab the job?

20:23.432 --> 20:25.392
I would say that's pretty interesting.

20:28.478 --> 20:30.314
Not much of a talker, are you?

20:31.440 --> 20:32.566
No.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.234
Well...

20:36.278 --> 20:37.654
glad to have you on board.

20:37.738 --> 20:38.822
Yeah.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.294
The docking system design team
works out there.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.254
You'll be here with us in Ops,

20:54.338 --> 20:57.132
working on procedures
and timelines for the docking module.

20:57.841 --> 21:00.344
That's Elaine, Hank, Bobby.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.221
Most of us were
on the old Apollo missions.

21:04.806 --> 21:07.935
And if you have any questions,
feel free to ask.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.229
Welcome to Apollo-Soyuz.

21:33.460 --> 21:36.380
Once a month, you take anybody rotating
back home back up to their shuttle.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.466
You get the new crew, you bring 'em
back with you here to Jamestown.

21:39.550 --> 21:42.094
Now, other than that, your job is
gonna be to retrieve unmanned cargo

21:42.177 --> 21:43.929
from various points on the surface.

21:44.012 --> 21:46.390
You land. You hook up the cable,

21:46.473 --> 21:49.393
winch the containers up into
the cargo hold, you bring them back here.

21:49.476 --> 21:52.813
Then you unload, refuel, systems check
and a whole lot of maintenance.

21:52.896 --> 21:55.190
Yeah, I get it. I'm basically
a truck driver up here.

21:55.774 --> 21:58.235
Yeah, we get a lot of pilots up here
always thinking they know best,

21:58.318 --> 22:00.445
so let me just disabuse you
of that right now.

22:00.529 --> 22:02.114
I've been doing this a long time.

22:02.197 --> 22:04.658
I know this beast
like the back of my hand.

22:04.741 --> 22:06.785
Now this is not some Piper Cub.

22:07.327 --> 22:10.831
She's like a wild stallion.
You gotta have a deft touch.

22:11.248 --> 22:12.624
Think I can handle it, Doug.

22:18.589 --> 22:21.008
-Auto-start good.
-Keep it steady.

22:25.637 --> 22:27.055
Easy.

22:27.139 --> 22:28.223
Shit.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.101
Shit.

22:31.185 --> 22:34.771
Put your hand back on the ACA
and let it switch to P167 automatically.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.400
-There you go.
-All right.

22:38.483 --> 22:39.902
Copy that.

22:40.569 --> 22:42.154
Now I got it. Got ya!

22:54.458 --> 22:55.792
Yeehaw!

22:57.669 --> 22:58.879
All right.

23:02.799 --> 23:04.551
"The guy next to you on the subway

23:04.635 --> 23:06.637
seems like Superman to me,

23:06.720 --> 23:08.222
what they used to call a god.

23:08.305 --> 23:10.432
How easy for him to flirt,

23:10.516 --> 23:11.934
to make you smile,

23:12.017 --> 23:14.895
to hear your golden laughter
and joke with you again.

23:14.978 --> 23:17.272
'Will he have your phone number
before the last stop?'

23:17.356 --> 23:18.815
is a game for gods.

23:19.233 --> 23:22.444
My tongue would shatter
before I said a word

23:22.528 --> 23:24.154
if you even looked at me."

23:37.459 --> 23:38.460
Fragment number 16.

23:41.839 --> 23:43.173
Look at you.

23:45.634 --> 23:46.677
Hi.

23:48.846 --> 23:51.014
That was great.

23:51.098 --> 23:52.224
You were great.

23:52.766 --> 23:55.394
Bet you were wondering
how a bartender turns into a poet.

23:56.895 --> 24:00.399
No, you always thought more than you said.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.442
Yeah. Well, some point,
it just went the other way

24:02.526 --> 24:04.444
and now I just talk without thinking.

24:11.869 --> 24:13.161
You still in Texas?

24:13.620 --> 24:14.621
Austin. Yeah.

24:15.205 --> 24:16.206
Of course.

24:18.083 --> 24:19.585
I heard you moved to the moon.

24:19.668 --> 24:22.045
-Yeah, I bought a condo there.
-Well, why not?

24:25.841 --> 24:26.967
-Hi.
-Hi.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.262
Ellen, this is Elise, my partner.

24:31.471 --> 24:33.015
Hi, Elise.

24:33.098 --> 24:36.894
I've heard so much about you.
We see you in the newspaper all the time.

24:38.437 --> 24:41.440
I'm sorry to interrupt. George wants to
introduce you to someone.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.774
Okay.

24:42.858 --> 24:45.402
-Sorry.
-No, of course. Go.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.571
-Nice to meet you.
-Yeah, you too.

24:47.654 --> 24:48.655
Thanks for coming.

24:49.072 --> 24:50.407
Good seeing you.

25:08.884 --> 25:12.054
Ellen. Hi. Sorry, I just--

25:12.137 --> 25:13.347
I wanted to...

25:14.806 --> 25:17.184
Would it be weird for us
to get a drink sometime?

25:18.644 --> 25:23.065
No. Not at all. I mean, it would be nice.

25:23.732 --> 25:24.858
-To catch up.
-Yeah.

25:25.776 --> 25:27.986
I've got a reading in Amarillo tomorrow,

25:28.070 --> 25:30.072
but I'll be back in Houston
in a few weeks.

25:32.115 --> 25:33.742
Okay.

25:33.825 --> 25:35.077
Great.

25:35.744 --> 25:39.206
-Great. Okay, I'll see you then.
-Okay.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.966
That shot of you stepping
onto the moon, boy, that was something.

25:49.383 --> 25:52.052
Sure wish Neil Armstrong
looked that sexy in a space suit.

25:53.303 --> 25:54.596
Come on, Johnny.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.807
I thought Neil looked pretty good myself.

25:57.975 --> 26:02.062
So, how's it been going
on your first few days at Jamestown?

26:02.646 --> 26:05.440
Everyone has just been so welcoming.

26:05.524 --> 26:08.735
It's been great.
It's like a village up here.

26:08.819 --> 26:11.613
Well, tell the villagers
all of us down here say hello.

26:11.697 --> 26:13.365
Will do, Johnny.

26:13.448 --> 26:18.495
Tracy Stevens, ladies and gentlemen.
Our first ever guest from the moon.

26:18.579 --> 26:21.206
Thank you, everyone.
I'll see you soon, Johnny.

26:23.667 --> 26:27.629
I bet Ron and Nancy tuned in for that.
Pretty cool.

26:28.672 --> 26:30.215
I like Letterman.

26:31.258 --> 26:32.301
Okay.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.543
Approaching 42 Alpha.

28:03.934 --> 28:05.644
Approaching 51 Foxtrot.

28:31.170 --> 28:33.714
-How's the food?
-It serves its purpose.

28:34.923 --> 28:36.091
Hey, Gordo.

28:39.887 --> 28:41.930
What on earth is your father doing?

28:42.014 --> 28:43.182
Good question.

28:51.064 --> 28:53.358
Good morning
from the south pole of the moon.

28:53.442 --> 28:58.280
It's Tracy Stevens wishing all you
nine-to-fivers a sunny day on 88.5,

28:58.363 --> 28:59.907
New York's number one choice...

28:59.990 --> 29:01.700
Keep rocking to WHU FM.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.285
Hey, y'all. It's Tracy Stevens

29:03.368 --> 29:06.747
kicking up moondust for the listeners
of K-Billy's Sounds of the '70s.

29:06.830 --> 29:10.918
-And you're listening to Hot 97.
-Houston's 96.7. The Brick.

29:15.339 --> 29:16.757
Approaching 26 Yankee.

29:18.509 --> 29:23.347
With the blue-green Earth
on the horizon and Milky Way above

29:23.430 --> 29:28.227
and stars and sun,
bigger than you can imagine.

29:28.310 --> 29:31.355
Johnny, you can't help
but be in awe of the universe.

29:31.438 --> 29:33.899
Wow. Astronaut Tracy--

29:57.089 --> 29:58.590
Approaching 85 Charlie.

29:59.174 --> 30:02.594
Now, a moon day is 655 hours long.
Is that right?

30:02.678 --> 30:03.846
That's correct.

30:03.929 --> 30:06.306
That's what, Ed, 30 hangovers?

30:35.836 --> 30:37.421
-You okay, Dad?
-Yeah.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.715
It's all part of the training, Son.

30:56.940 --> 30:58.942
I'm Tracy Stevens live from the moon,

30:59.026 --> 31:02.487
and you're listening to the Morning Zoo
on KQ 92.

31:08.577 --> 31:11.788
Well, it's lots of work, lots of poker,

31:11.872 --> 31:14.499
but I'm still digging the heck out of it.

31:14.583 --> 31:16.251
Y'all should come up for a visit.

31:16.335 --> 31:19.213
I could be the first man to bounce
an alimony check from the moon.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.793
Thank fucking God.

33:40.979 --> 33:42.856
Why are the M16s painted white?

33:43.524 --> 33:45.442
So it doesn't melt through your gloves.

33:45.526 --> 33:48.612
Temps get as high as 250
on the lunar surface.

33:49.029 --> 33:51.114
Hope you packed some sunscreen, Bernitz.

33:54.201 --> 33:55.994
-This is crazy.
-Tell me about it.

33:56.078 --> 33:57.788
They still haven't given us any guidelines

33:57.871 --> 33:59.831
as to when we're allowed
to shoot these things.

33:59.915 --> 34:01.667
Well, today is your lucky day.

34:03.335 --> 34:07.548
I have here the Rules of Engagement
for Use of Force on the moon.

34:07.631 --> 34:09.382
Straight from the secretary of defense.

34:09.466 --> 34:12.302
Well, it was nice of them to give us
the word before we took off.

34:12.386 --> 34:13.887
Probably change it mid-flight.

34:13.971 --> 34:16.014
-And again when we touch down.
-Listen up.

34:17.139 --> 34:19.810
I've walked through these
with General Bradford and the--

34:28.485 --> 34:31.822
You can read this page-turner
for yourself in your spare time.

34:31.905 --> 34:33.114
The gist of it is this:

34:33.197 --> 34:36.409
In reclaiming site 357 Bravo,

34:36.493 --> 34:38.911
you will not fire your weapon

34:38.996 --> 34:43.166
unless it is in response to a hostile act
or hostile intent.

34:43.250 --> 34:45.878
What exactly is "hostile intent"?

34:46.503 --> 34:50.215
"Hostile intent" is what my face will look
like if you make me read this shit to you.

34:51.842 --> 34:54.678
Commander... command.

34:54.761 --> 34:56.054
Aye, aye, ma'am.

34:57.139 --> 34:58.140
Godspeed.

35:05.772 --> 35:10.277
We had plotted the entire year
to steal the army's mascot.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.905
-The mule?
-No, a flock of mules.

35:12.988 --> 35:15.657
-They don't have just one.
-I think you mean a herd.

35:17.242 --> 35:19.620
We broke those guys out of the stable.
They were flying.

35:21.163 --> 35:22.372
-Admiral Baldwin.
-As you were.

35:22.456 --> 35:24.666
-Dad.
-Hey.

35:24.750 --> 35:26.293
Sorry I'm late.

35:26.376 --> 35:28.003
I can get you a plate.

35:28.962 --> 35:30.339
Just pull up another chair.

35:30.422 --> 35:32.132
I'd better get going.

35:32.216 --> 35:33.634
Me and Jimmy
are supposed to call Mom in a bit.

35:33.717 --> 35:34.718
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

35:34.801 --> 35:36.887
-Tell her we said hi.
-Yeah.

35:45.187 --> 35:47.814
Spaghetti night.

35:49.858 --> 35:51.777
Yeah, I didn't think you were coming.

35:53.028 --> 35:54.029
Well...

35:56.448 --> 35:59.660
Looks like a pretty good crowd out there.

36:00.244 --> 36:01.245
Yeah.

36:04.248 --> 36:07.334
-Hope you're hungry.
-A feast.

36:07.417 --> 36:11.296
Wish I could hang, Dad, but I have to
go help Ashley with dinner service, so...

36:11.380 --> 36:12.381
-Really?
-Yeah.

36:36.363 --> 36:40.617
Was driving over here, I saw
Wrath of Khan was playing at the Alabama.

36:41.869 --> 36:47.082
Maybe you could sneak out
and we could catch the late-night.

36:47.165 --> 36:48.834
Kelly and I saw it last week.

36:51.753 --> 36:53.422
-Was it good?
-Yeah.

36:54.631 --> 36:55.799
Then Spock dies.

38:03.325 --> 38:05.244
-What's going on?
-Grab your oxygen mask.

38:05.327 --> 38:06.745
-What?
-Your mask.

38:08.288 --> 38:09.873
Jesus Christ.

38:11.166 --> 38:12.668
High carbon dioxide alarm.

38:12.751 --> 38:15.337
-High CO2? In which module?
-Can't tell!

38:15.420 --> 38:19.716
Toxic atmosphere detected.
Everyone prepare for possible evacuation.

38:19.800 --> 38:20.926
This is not a drill.

38:21.510 --> 38:23.595
I repeat, this is not a drill.

38:25.722 --> 38:27.474
False alarm, folks.

38:29.893 --> 38:31.311
What the hell happened?

38:31.395 --> 38:33.313
Computer read a spike in CO2.

38:34.106 --> 38:36.775
Looks like we had a blocked vent
in crew quarters B.

38:38.986 --> 38:40.279
Oh, God.

38:41.947 --> 38:45.242
I'm sorry. I can't sleep.

38:45.325 --> 38:49.413
I can't sleep, so I was just trying to--

38:49.496 --> 38:52.124
Tracy, we're one month
into your tour up here.

38:53.584 --> 38:57.880
And honestly, things aren't
going very well, are they?

38:57.963 --> 38:59.214
No, sir.

39:00.174 --> 39:02.551
And you've got five more months to go.

39:05.012 --> 39:06.972
I guess I've been having trouble...

39:08.348 --> 39:10.934
adjusting to life up here.

39:14.813 --> 39:16.857
Let me give you some advice.

39:19.943 --> 39:23.197
This is my second tour, and...

39:24.364 --> 39:27.826
I've learned that being up here
on Jamestown,

39:27.910 --> 39:30.871
living in the same space day after day,

39:31.747 --> 39:34.416
you just have to embrace the--

39:37.878 --> 39:39.129
Have you been drinking?

39:42.382 --> 39:44.176
-You're drunk.
-No, I'm just--

39:44.259 --> 39:47.179
You're one of three LSAM pilots
on this base.

39:47.262 --> 39:49.556
What if this had been a real emergency
and we had to evacuate?

39:49.640 --> 39:51.225
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-No, you're not fine.

39:51.308 --> 39:54.811
This is completely unacceptable.
I'm writing you up.

39:54.895 --> 39:56.355
Hey. Don't do that.

39:56.438 --> 39:58.774
If you report me to Houston,
they'll ground me.

40:02.444 --> 40:03.612
This is my life.

40:04.279 --> 40:05.322
Please.

40:07.908 --> 40:10.410
Could you please just give me
one more chance?

40:20.003 --> 40:21.088
All right.

40:22.840 --> 40:25.968
But the special treatment is over, okay?

40:26.051 --> 40:27.052
Okay.

40:27.594 --> 40:30.931
-No more interviews. No more press.
-No problem.

40:31.014 --> 40:34.476
And I'm assigning you
to work a training detail on B shift...

40:34.560 --> 40:36.061
in addition to your normal duties.

40:36.144 --> 40:37.145
Double shift.

40:37.729 --> 40:39.606
-Which means you'll be--
-Be hot racking it.

40:39.690 --> 40:42.568
If you don't like it, you can
sleep on the floor for all I care.

40:42.651 --> 40:43.819
That'll be all.

41:29.823 --> 41:31.116
Hey, Deke.

41:34.745 --> 41:37.247
I finally made it to the moon.

41:37.831 --> 41:40.167
I don't know what people see
in this fucking place.

41:40.250 --> 41:42.085
It's just a big ball of gray dirt.

41:43.587 --> 41:47.841
I don't know. I just thought
it was gonna be somethin'.

41:49.510 --> 41:52.638
I just feel like... I'm...

41:55.265 --> 41:57.100
just drifting out here...

41:58.435 --> 41:59.436
alone.

42:01.146 --> 42:02.731
No one to talk to.

42:05.234 --> 42:06.985
Except maybe for you.

42:07.861 --> 42:11.031
If you could, you'd tell me
to shut the hell up, but...

42:12.199 --> 42:13.867
you can't, so...

42:15.160 --> 42:17.287
sorry you're stuck listening to me.

42:30.217 --> 42:31.927
I miss my boys.

42:40.227 --> 42:43.730
I miss my bed.
Hell, I even miss my bathtub.

42:46.275 --> 42:48.026
I know.

42:48.110 --> 42:51.238
I know. What do I have to complain about?

42:51.321 --> 42:53.574
I gotta quit my whining. I know.

42:55.033 --> 42:56.493
I should be happy.

42:57.119 --> 42:59.121
I got everything I ever wanted.

43:02.624 --> 43:05.669
It's just that now, now that I'm here...

43:09.798 --> 43:11.216
I don't know...

43:13.844 --> 43:16.513
it's just so...

43:17.931 --> 43:19.266
empty.

43:42.623 --> 43:43.624
Dad?

43:56.094 --> 43:57.221
Hey, boys.

43:58.597 --> 44:00.432
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

44:02.059 --> 44:03.977
Just training.

44:06.772 --> 44:07.856
Like the closet?

44:10.484 --> 44:13.820
Yeah. Like the closet.

44:15.197 --> 44:16.198
What closet?

44:17.157 --> 44:20.619
I found him in the closet
with his space helmet on the other day.

44:27.417 --> 44:28.669
Everything okay, Dad?

44:30.045 --> 44:31.755
Yeah. You've been acting kinda weird.

44:32.714 --> 44:34.758
Yeah. I'm okay.

44:36.927 --> 44:40.889
I'm just getting ready
to go back up to Jamestown.

44:41.765 --> 44:44.059
A lot to keep track of, you know?

44:45.394 --> 44:48.230
A lot to wrap your mind around.

44:49.648 --> 44:50.983
Gotta be prepared.

44:52.192 --> 44:54.862
-Is it working?
-Yeah.

44:57.406 --> 44:59.741
Kind of. You know, not as...

45:01.994 --> 45:03.954
not as well as I'd like, but...

45:06.206 --> 45:08.292
Is this about what
happened up there last time?

45:11.587 --> 45:13.088
What do you know about that?

45:14.214 --> 45:17.134
I mean, mainly just what
was in all the reports on TV.

45:17.217 --> 45:19.720
You had to fly Mrs. Poole back
when she broke her arm

45:19.803 --> 45:22.598
and that things were different after.

45:24.892 --> 45:26.143
You never went up again.

45:26.852 --> 45:27.936
Yeah.

45:33.525 --> 45:34.693
You know, you...

45:35.903 --> 45:38.530
you try to hold everything together.

45:40.699 --> 45:44.203
Try to be strong for your family.

45:46.079 --> 45:48.040
You know, tell 'em that you're safe...

45:49.124 --> 45:50.918
and that you're gonna be okay.

45:51.919 --> 45:53.378
But the...

45:55.631 --> 45:57.299
truth is, boys...

46:05.265 --> 46:07.434
it's not always gonna be okay.

46:12.814 --> 46:14.274
Sometimes...

46:16.318 --> 46:18.195
shit happens that you can't control.

46:20.239 --> 46:21.907
Things can go wrong in a second.

46:23.283 --> 46:24.993
And you realize that...

46:27.287 --> 46:32.793
I realized up there that I was weak.

46:34.378 --> 46:35.629
I was afraid.

46:36.505 --> 46:41.635
So... I'm just trying to
burn that from my head.

46:44.179 --> 46:45.472
You know, that fear.

46:47.182 --> 46:48.475
Before I go back up.

46:53.480 --> 46:54.523
How's it going?

46:55.732 --> 46:56.817
Not great.

47:02.239 --> 47:03.365
Maybe we can help.

47:05.659 --> 47:07.995
I wish you could, bud, but--

47:08.078 --> 47:09.746
I think Jimmy has an idea.

47:13.166 --> 47:15.169
-Cannonball!
-You dick!

47:26.180 --> 47:27.222
Going under.

47:32.686 --> 47:34.396
When did this happen?

47:34.479 --> 47:36.648
I'd say like two months ago.

47:37.357 --> 47:40.360
-Disco dancing?
-He loves it.

47:40.444 --> 47:43.030
-Wow.
-He and Peter go every Saturday night.

47:43.780 --> 47:47.367
And by now, they're probably
well into the hustle.

47:48.452 --> 47:51.830
Does he wear
the whole vest and collar thing?

47:51.914 --> 47:54.499
Oh, yeah, the whole getup.

47:54.583 --> 47:57.211
-This round is on the house.
-Thanks, Karen.

47:57.294 --> 47:59.963
Karen, that's really not necessary.

48:00.047 --> 48:02.424
Nonsense. It's so good to see you again.

48:02.508 --> 48:07.721
Yeah, I have to admit, when I heard
you bought the place I was surprised.

48:07.804 --> 48:09.723
Yeah, so was I. Trust me.

48:10.807 --> 48:12.976
You've done a pretty good job
of making it look...

48:14.269 --> 48:16.438
-Less like a shithole?
-Yeah.

48:17.439 --> 48:19.483
Yeah. Baby steps though. Baby steps.

48:19.566 --> 48:20.776
Still not sure about those.

48:20.859 --> 48:25.030
Oh, yes, those. You and everybody else.

48:25.614 --> 48:28.116
Hey, if you ever wanna get back
behind the bar, you let me know.

48:28.200 --> 48:30.661
No, no, no. Thank you, but...

48:30.744 --> 48:32.412
I live in Austin now with my girlfriend.

48:35.624 --> 48:37.125
That's really wonderful.

48:37.668 --> 48:38.794
Congratulations.

48:39.503 --> 48:41.547
You're welcome back here
anytime, all right?

48:41.630 --> 48:42.840
-Thanks, Karen.
-Okay.

48:51.348 --> 48:52.349
Cheers.

48:52.432 --> 48:53.475
Cheers.

48:59.314 --> 49:01.275
So you said Larry
was working at Boeing now?

49:01.358 --> 49:02.359
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

49:02.985 --> 49:04.444
He likes it.

49:04.528 --> 49:06.655
Decent hours. Not as stressful.

49:07.906 --> 49:10.742
You've really... just made a life of it.

49:12.578 --> 49:13.912
Are you thinking of having kids or...

49:15.497 --> 49:16.582
I don't know.

49:18.333 --> 49:20.085
We've talked about it.

49:20.586 --> 49:22.254
Elise definitely wants kids.

49:22.963 --> 49:24.173
But not you?

49:25.966 --> 49:29.553
I've had my fill of slurring,
slobbering humans.

49:29.636 --> 49:31.346
I'm sure.

49:35.726 --> 49:36.727
Did you...

49:40.105 --> 49:42.482
You ever figure out
which poem was about you?

49:49.990 --> 49:51.533
Took me a long time to write that.

49:53.076 --> 49:54.620
To be able to write that. It's...

49:56.997 --> 49:57.998
Yeah.

50:05.797 --> 50:07.758
Well, anyway, it was a long time ago.

50:09.593 --> 50:11.220
Finally got my shit together.

50:12.304 --> 50:13.680
Finished my master's at UT.

50:14.181 --> 50:16.391
Might stick with teaching. Not sure.

50:17.392 --> 50:20.938
Unless... I become the next poet laureate.

50:21.021 --> 50:23.440
Of course. Goes without saying.

50:23.524 --> 50:24.566
Yeah.

50:29.738 --> 50:32.407
I should probably be heading back.
It's getting late.

50:32.491 --> 50:34.701
Drive all the way back to Austin tonight.

50:34.785 --> 50:36.912
Right. Okay.

50:38.539 --> 50:39.873
This was nice.

50:39.957 --> 50:41.333
Yeah. It was.

50:43.460 --> 50:45.128
So, I guess this is goodbye then.

50:47.339 --> 50:48.465
I guess so.

50:49.174 --> 50:50.217
Bye, Ellen.

50:51.677 --> 50:53.136
Bye.

51:22.708 --> 51:24.710
What do you think is in those cases?

51:24.793 --> 51:28.297
I'll tell you one thing,
it's not sticks and stones.

51:31.675 --> 51:35.262
Welcome to Jamestown.
I'm Al Rossi, commander of the base.

51:36.263 --> 51:40.601
After you're all settled in, we'll have
a debrief in my quarters about your--

51:40.684 --> 51:42.644
-your mission up here.
-Copy.

51:42.728 --> 51:46.273
Bernitz, it's my understanding that
this is your first time on Jamestown.

51:46.356 --> 51:47.357
It is.

51:47.441 --> 51:49.985
Well, we have a little tradition
we like to do for new arrivals.

51:50.861 --> 51:57.117
Charles Bernitz, I hereby christen
thee the new Linus of Jamestown.

51:57.201 --> 51:59.453
-Linus?
-It's from Peanuts.

52:00.537 --> 52:02.122
Stevens, you'll be training Charles here

52:02.206 --> 52:04.583
on advanced LSAM operations
for their mission.

52:04.666 --> 52:07.794
He's SIM certified but obviously
hasn't flown it up here. Clear?

52:07.878 --> 52:09.421
Well, aye, aye, sir.

52:09.963 --> 52:12.090
Now, why don't you show them
to crew quarters A

52:12.174 --> 52:15.052
and then you can give the Linus here
the standard orientation.

52:15.135 --> 52:16.887
Copy that. Follow me, y'all.

52:18.138 --> 52:19.806
Do I have to go by Linus?

52:19.890 --> 52:21.475
You'll get used to it.

52:29.483 --> 52:30.484
Wow.

52:32.569 --> 52:35.614
You used to have that exact same
NASA ashtray on your coffee table.

52:36.156 --> 52:39.618
Well, that's the actual one.
Finally just found the right place for it.

52:40.827 --> 52:44.248
-Good night, guys. Thanks for today.
-Thank you, Karen. See you tomorrow.

52:48.043 --> 52:52.339
I remember this one time me and Jimmy were
at your house for a sleepover.

52:54.967 --> 52:57.386
It was really late.
We were being really stupid,

52:57.469 --> 52:59.972
and Admiral Baldwin
was getting really, really upset.

53:01.139 --> 53:02.850
We were all pretty much terrified of him.

53:02.933 --> 53:05.310
Yeah, he can be
a little intimidating sometimes.

53:06.895 --> 53:09.690
Well, the bedroom door
comes flying open and you come out.

53:09.773 --> 53:11.483
Thank God it wasn't Admiral Baldwin.

53:11.567 --> 53:14.111
-And you said, "Dang it, boys!"
-Dang it?

53:14.194 --> 53:17.155
Yeah, even at the time
I was like what adult says "dang it"?

53:17.239 --> 53:18.490
Me, apparently.

53:19.950 --> 53:23.704
And then you said,
"Knock it off and go to bed right now."

53:23.787 --> 53:26.123
You said it real loud
so that Admiral Baldwin could hear.

53:26.206 --> 53:27.749
And then you went like this.

53:29.293 --> 53:32.379
And you whispered, "Just keep it down."

53:33.130 --> 53:34.298
That was great.

53:35.799 --> 53:37.509
And I always thought, "Best mom ever."

53:40.012 --> 53:41.388
You know, or at least top five.

53:41.471 --> 53:42.723
Really? Top five?

53:43.307 --> 53:44.308
Okay, who was better?

53:44.391 --> 53:46.852
Mrs. Henry had those
chocolate chip cookies with walnuts.

53:46.935 --> 53:49.605
-What about my ambrosia?
-I suppressed that memory.

53:49.688 --> 53:51.732
Come on. No, you didn't.

53:54.776 --> 53:58.989
I do remember this other time I was
supposed to come over early for lunch.

53:59.072 --> 54:01.575
I'd gotten there.
The door was unlocked, so I came in.

54:01.658 --> 54:04.786
I heard music playing.
I think it was Elvis.

54:04.870 --> 54:09.208
-Oh, no.
-Yeah. And there you were

54:09.291 --> 54:12.920
in the middle of the living room
just dancing.

54:13.837 --> 54:14.922
By yourself.

54:15.964 --> 54:18.467
I mean, I've never seen anyone
dance by themselves before.

54:18.884 --> 54:21.970
Of course. What kinda nut
dances alone in the middle of the day?

54:33.565 --> 54:35.359
You know, I still think about Shane...

54:37.110 --> 54:38.529
pretty much every day.

54:41.114 --> 54:43.116
Yeah, it's the dividing line in my life.

54:45.869 --> 54:47.538
Before and after, like...

54:50.165 --> 54:51.583
BC and AD.

54:53.460 --> 54:57.965
When he was here and... after he was gone.

55:03.554 --> 55:04.763
Me too.

55:13.897 --> 55:15.190
Good work today, Danny.

55:16.984 --> 55:18.443
It's my job.

55:18.527 --> 55:23.282
No, it's not.
Your job is to protect our nation.

55:23.782 --> 55:24.783
Okay.

55:24.867 --> 55:27.995
-Okay, my summer job.
-Yeah.

55:28.078 --> 55:31.582
-Dang it.
-Don't you dare.

55:36.628 --> 55:37.629
Good night.

55:38.672 --> 55:39.965
Good night, Mrs. Baldwin.
