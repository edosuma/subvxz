00:08.800 --> 00:10.510
[Enzo on TV]<i> Citizens of New Seattle,</i>

00:11.219 --> 00:14.431
<i>the free-zombie state of Seattle</i>
<i>is now under new command.</i>

00:15.015 --> 00:19.019
<i>I assure you,</i>
<i>peace and order will soon be at hand.</i>

00:19.394 --> 00:22.647
<i>My predecessor believed in the carrot.</i>

00:22.772 --> 00:28.111
<i>We have reached a point at which I believe</i>
<i>the stick delivers better results.</i>

00:28.570 --> 00:30.613
<i>Humans must put down their weapons.</i>

00:31.114 --> 00:33.908
<i>Those who fail to do so will be executed.</i>

00:33.992 --> 00:37.996
<i>Those who surrender during battle</i>
<i>will be scratched, then starved...</i>

00:38.079 --> 00:40.123
-Hey. Listen.
<i>-...then turned into killing machines</i>

00:40.206 --> 00:42.709
<i>-who answer only to me.</i>
-Are you still working over at KCEW?

00:47.255 --> 00:48.173
All clear, Lieutenant.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.258
We can't be too careful.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.259
Thanks.

01:02.520 --> 01:03.521
Check the deck.

01:10.904 --> 01:15.325
Lt. Gordon Philips.
Five of clubs. Not bad.

01:16.493 --> 01:19.120
I would sure love to get rid
of some of these high cards.

01:19.204 --> 01:22.207
What about Renegade and Lillywhite?
We got eyes on them?

01:23.083 --> 01:23.917
'Fraid not.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.628
Renegade could've got 'em out of town.

01:26.711 --> 01:27.754
No.

01:28.713 --> 01:29.923
They're not sitting this out.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.300
Tweet out her work address.
Let's flush her out.

01:33.635 --> 01:37.472
Until they show up,
let's go for the new king of spades.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.186
[Liv] <i>The TSA agent stared at my ID</i>
<i>for a full 30 seconds</i>

01:43.269 --> 01:44.521
<i>before waving me through.</i>

01:45.313 --> 01:46.606
<i>I'd feel safer driving,</i>

01:46.689 --> 01:49.234
<i>but Clive's anxious to get back</i>
<i>to his pregnant wife.</i>

01:50.318 --> 01:52.320
<i>And of course, Ravi has to get back.</i>

01:52.946 --> 01:54.739
<i>He has the formula for the cure.</i>

01:54.823 --> 01:57.158
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare.
It's just...

01:58.034 --> 01:59.702
I feel like I know you.

01:59.786 --> 02:00.829
I get that a lot.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.457
No, I'm sure I've seen your face before.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.709
Are you on TV?

02:06.793 --> 02:08.211
-No.
-No?

02:08.294 --> 02:09.796
Huh. [laughs]

02:09.879 --> 02:10.964
Sorry.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.551
You sure?

02:17.262 --> 02:19.264
[theme music playing]

02:24.310 --> 02:26.604
It should not surprise any of us

02:26.688 --> 02:28.940
that Dolly Durkins, the leader of

02:29.023 --> 02:33.987
the "non-violent" Concerned Humans
Imposing Common Sense,

02:34.070 --> 02:36.322
is calling the shots for the Dead Enders.

02:37.407 --> 02:41.452
Murphy, anything we should know
about your mother?

02:41.536 --> 02:43.663
Keeps a knife in her boot.
She'll go down fighting.

02:45.123 --> 02:48.209
We have lost 30 soldiers in 72 hours.

02:48.626 --> 02:51.838
With each, her followers post a Tweet.

02:53.423 --> 02:56.134
Nevertheless,
I want her taken alive if possible.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.470
Sir, they're setting us on fire.

02:59.554 --> 03:02.599
[stammers] This is why the time
of patty-cake is over.

03:04.601 --> 03:05.602
Dismissed.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.731
[cell phone vibrating]

03:16.279 --> 03:17.947
[chattering indistinctly]

03:23.703 --> 03:26.456
Lt. Collins, have you seen a ghost?

03:28.374 --> 03:29.542
Lillywhite just called.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.002
He wants to turn himself in.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.380
He's seeing the same Tweets we're seeing.
He wants to fight.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.675
Well, then, invite him in.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.886
He'll be safe?

03:40.345 --> 03:44.557
We need fighters. When motivated,
Lillywhite is certainly that.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.192
Key to the process.

03:54.734 --> 03:55.902
Stay awake all night.

03:55.985 --> 03:57.987
Zolpidem at take-off, power sleep,

03:58.446 --> 04:00.740
wake up fresh in Portland,
and nail this pitch.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.952
[clears throat]
God, I love modern medicine.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.079
Earbuds?

04:06.162 --> 04:07.163
Mmm. Don't mind if I do.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.499
[flight attendant] Earbuds?

04:12.335 --> 04:13.336
Earbuds?

04:13.419 --> 04:14.420
[woman] Please.

04:14.545 --> 04:15.546
No, thanks.

04:15.838 --> 04:18.216
Oh, but could I get a mimosa?

04:18.299 --> 04:19.175
Of course.

04:20.468 --> 04:21.636
Jefferson High?

04:21.719 --> 04:23.846
Nope. I'm pretty sure
you're thinking of someone else.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.568
It's just,

05:19.193 --> 05:21.821
I'm usually so good with faces.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.907
There was a commercial
that ran nonstop for a while.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.035
My friends said
I looked just like the mom in it.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.578
"Pirate Pat's Seafood Snacks."

05:29.620 --> 05:31.289
"All right, ye little landlubbers!

05:31.831 --> 05:34.625
Don't tell Dad
that Mom left the galley empty.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.253
Remember, fed men tell no tales."

05:39.839 --> 05:40.840
No, that's not it.

05:43.384 --> 05:44.385
[cell phone chimes]

05:45.553 --> 05:47.055
-What?
-Oh!

05:47.138 --> 05:48.181
[businessman sighs]

05:50.808 --> 05:51.976
My wife just went into labor.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.563
Oh. Congrats, man.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.402
[mouthing] I'm so sorry.

06:14.707 --> 06:18.586
Your mimosa is too tempting.
I'm getting myself one. You want a refill?

06:18.669 --> 06:19.712
Sure.

06:27.303 --> 06:30.056
Excuse me. Can I please have two mimosas?

06:30.389 --> 06:32.183
-That kind of flight, huh?
-[laughs]

06:35.978 --> 06:37.063
[Liv clears throat]

06:40.274 --> 06:42.860
Oh, could I have some more nuts as well?

06:42.944 --> 06:43.778
Sure thing.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.958
Would you look at that? Water spots.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.003
[mouthing] It's not me.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.630
[mouthing] I can't tell. Which one.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.052
There you go. Good as new.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.430
Thank you.

07:16.894 --> 07:18.604
Oh, one of those for me?

07:20.731 --> 07:21.941
They're both mimosas, right?

07:22.984 --> 07:24.735
You should get the fuller one.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.171
...any patrols increased here--

07:43.254 --> 07:44.297
[Joyce] Commander.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.301
[Enzo] Ah, Major.

07:48.676 --> 07:52.555
I was afraid you would be out there
somewhere working against us.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.807
It's us or them now.

07:54.891 --> 07:55.933
I see that.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.269
Put me to work, Commander.

07:58.352 --> 07:59.353
[Enzo] Excellent.

07:59.937 --> 08:03.858
Lock him in the holding cells.
Once he goes Romero, give him the formula.

08:04.567 --> 08:10.156
You will find being of service much easier
when you no longer have a choice.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.949
I was promised I would get to fight.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.576
Oh, you will fight.

08:14.494 --> 08:18.039
And you will be
a very dangerous monster indeed.

08:21.709 --> 08:24.462
Ames, you're with me.

08:35.431 --> 08:36.641
This is for you.

08:38.851 --> 08:39.852
What am I supposed to do with it?

08:39.936 --> 08:41.521
Call us on it, once you've put this on.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.023
Blaine has requested
the pleasure of your company.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.859
Best I can tell,
he's got some <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> fetish.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.445
You kids know the words to "Be My Guest"?

08:49.529 --> 08:50.655
[Don E laughs]

08:51.656 --> 08:53.282
You can tell Blaine he can go to hell.

08:53.366 --> 08:57.495
That's one way you could play it.
Or if you want to survive,

08:57.578 --> 08:59.747
put on the dress,
play make-believe with the beast.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.335
Peyton.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.682
She's not due for two more weeks.
This can't be happening.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.559
We land in 30 minutes.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.395
We can be in Seattle in six hours
if everything breaks our way.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.897
Labor is usually
an eight to 12-hour process.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.065
We'll get there.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.650
[sighs]

09:27.733 --> 09:29.443
[Ravi] At least
your seat-mate's conked out.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.571
[Liv] Thank God for small miracles.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.282
[Ravi] So, assuming
we get back in time,

09:34.365 --> 09:36.242
and Major gets the Max Rager, what then?

09:36.325 --> 09:39.870
[Liv] We let the city know
that a cheap and plentiful cure exists.

09:40.621 --> 09:41.706
[Clive] How?

09:42.707 --> 09:44.083
[Liv] We'll think of something.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.336
[Romeros snarling]

09:47.420 --> 09:48.588
[Joyce] Frisk him, Ames.

09:52.842 --> 09:53.926
Spread them, Commander.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.637
[Major] What happened to your face, Ames?

09:57.221 --> 09:58.472
Since you asked...

09:59.432 --> 10:01.225
One of those humans you care so much about

10:01.309 --> 10:03.436
opened up on me
with a freaking flamethrower.

10:03.686 --> 10:04.812
So, that's when I...

10:07.565 --> 10:08.691
Take off your shirt.

10:09.483 --> 10:10.901
Is this really necessary?

10:10.985 --> 10:11.944
I'm a modest man.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.279
Take it off.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.542
Well, look here.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.044
Enzo's gonna kill you.

10:28.502 --> 10:29.503
And I'm gonna enjoy--

10:29.587 --> 10:30.880
[silenced gunshot]

10:35.259 --> 10:37.094
You got ten minutes
to be in a weapons crate.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.096
Spud and Diaz are guarding the Max Rager.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.265
Break out when you feel yourself
on the road.

10:41.849 --> 10:42.850
Good luck.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.353
Go make that cure.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.780
[Spud] The commander says shoot on sight,
anything that moves.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.031
Kids, too.

10:57.573 --> 11:00.159
Dead Enders have 'em running up
throwing grenades in our Humvees.

11:00.618 --> 11:01.661
Mow 'em down.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.038
-[distant whistling]
-Who's that?

11:06.457 --> 11:07.792
Looks like Ames.

11:07.875 --> 11:08.918
Ames.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.753
[both groan]

11:27.478 --> 11:28.437
A reminder.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.939
We ask you to remain in your seats

11:30.022 --> 11:32.691
until the pilot
has turned off the seat belt sign.

11:32.775 --> 11:35.319
We have a few passengers
who have quick connections,

11:35.403 --> 11:37.947
and ask for your patience
as we get them off the plane first.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.698
[passengers grumbling]

11:45.287 --> 11:46.664
[indistinct radio chatter]

11:48.374 --> 11:49.834
[inaudible]

11:55.339 --> 11:56.841
Ma'am, can you come with me?

11:58.509 --> 11:59.969
Do you know who she is?

12:00.052 --> 12:01.429
Let's not start a scene, ma'am.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.559
Sir, you too.

12:11.021 --> 12:12.106
Please, come with me.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.113
I'm not sure what's going on here,
but I need to be--

12:19.488 --> 12:20.531
Sir...

12:21.198 --> 12:23.242
We're here to help you
get back to Seattle.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.493
This is my brother, Michael.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.579
We have a kid sister in Seattle.

12:26.662 --> 12:29.665
You got her there. You saved her life.

12:29.748 --> 12:30.958
[gasps]

12:32.585 --> 12:35.171
I'll escort you to the Washington border.
Hope that'll help.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.672
[all sigh in relief]

12:36.755 --> 12:37.756
Yeah.

12:37.840 --> 12:38.674
[Clive] Yeah.

12:44.388 --> 12:45.306
[Don E] Her attitude?

12:45.389 --> 12:48.017
You mean, was she jumping for joy,
so delighted by the dress,

12:48.142 --> 12:50.394
she couldn't wait to be romanced
by her kidnapper?

12:50.478 --> 12:51.645
Generally, she seemed

12:51.729 --> 12:55.691
massively offended, frightened, appalled.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.318
Frightened I can work with.

12:57.401 --> 12:58.402
[Bubba] Boss.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.362
Got your chlorine pellets.

13:00.488 --> 13:01.822
Chlorine pellets?

13:01.906 --> 13:02.948
Yeah. For the well.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.284
It smells like
someone threw a carcass in there.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.203
-You didn't?
-No.

13:08.996 --> 13:13.751
"Scatter in the well every four hours
until smell dissipates." Get on it.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.127
Ten-four.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.338
[Peyton on radio] <i>Blaine,</i>
<i>can you come down here?</i>

13:18.672 --> 13:20.216
Never underestimate fright.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.343
It's a solid motivator.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.678
[children crying]

13:29.600 --> 13:30.601
It's Becca.

13:33.687 --> 13:34.730
She's dead.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.732
[sighs]

13:37.233 --> 13:39.401
Freylich kids. What are you gonna do?

13:39.777 --> 13:40.819
You can't have her.

13:41.529 --> 13:42.821
Which one are you talking about?

13:42.905 --> 13:44.198
Because either way--

13:44.281 --> 13:45.407
[groans]

13:45.491 --> 13:46.742
[Peyton] Run, run.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.953
Go, run.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.416
Oliver.

14:07.054 --> 14:07.888
[Oliver] Peyton!

14:09.014 --> 14:10.724
[groans] Go.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.436
-[groans]
-No!

14:15.521 --> 14:16.689
[tires screeching]

14:30.202 --> 14:31.412
[Enzo] Lt. Collins?

14:34.206 --> 14:36.667
Jessup reports finding Ames dead.

14:37.835 --> 14:41.463
And your old friend
Major Lillywhite has escaped.

14:41.547 --> 14:45.175
Perhaps you would like to take this chance
to beg for your life?

14:45.259 --> 14:47.970
Perhaps you'd like this chance
to kiss my--

14:49.638 --> 14:50.806
[body thuds]

14:56.604 --> 14:57.646
Where is everyone?

14:57.730 --> 14:58.772
Peyton?

14:58.856 --> 14:59.940
Kids, we're back.

15:00.024 --> 15:00.941
Where are they?

15:01.025 --> 15:02.026
I can't wait. I've gotta go.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.068
Clive, it's a couple of miles.
Let me call--

15:03.152 --> 15:04.445
Liv, I've gotta go.

15:16.957 --> 15:19.001
Full cereal bowls left on the table.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.337
[sniffs] The milk's gone bad.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.755
It looks like they left in a hurry.

15:22.838 --> 15:24.340
-[light buzzing]
-Ravi, if anything happened to them...

15:24.423 --> 15:25.549
[Ravi] Liv, look.

15:40.856 --> 15:41.857
Liv.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.442
[Michael] Thank God.

15:43.525 --> 15:44.818
-Thank goodness.
-I thought I'd never see you again.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.446
You're okay. You scared me.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.574
Of course I'm back. I missed you.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.411
Um, I'm sorry. Where's Peyton?
Is she with the Freylich kids?

15:54.495 --> 15:57.039
They didn't want to come back here.
They didn't think it was safe.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.208
Why'd you even leave here?
This is the safe house.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.417
We were kidnapped.

16:00.501 --> 16:03.045
That guy, Blaine, and his bald friend...

16:03.128 --> 16:05.464
Please, where is Peyton?

16:05.547 --> 16:07.800
They took us to Blaine's dad's mansion.

16:07.883 --> 16:08.842
Would someone please--

16:08.926 --> 16:09.969
They shot her.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.305
Is she still alive?

16:13.806 --> 16:14.974
She wasn't moving.

16:15.265 --> 16:17.851
[breathing heavily]

16:22.690 --> 16:23.857
Let's go.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.111
I'm gonna kill everyone over there.
You're welcome to help me.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.113
-You can't.
-You can't talk me out of this, Liv.

16:29.196 --> 16:30.823
I will go find Blaine and Don E,

16:30.906 --> 16:33.575
and I promise you, Ravi,
they'll get no mercy from me.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.619
You need to meet Major at the morgue.

16:35.703 --> 16:38.455
Everyone in Seattle is counting on you,
is counting on this cure.

16:39.623 --> 16:44.962
Liv, what's going to happen to us?
I mean, if the cure works?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.631
Well, you'll all get cured.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.759
But not Oliver. He's terminal.
If he gets the cure then--

16:50.843 --> 16:54.221
What happens to him?
Where do all the zombies like him go?

16:55.305 --> 16:56.974
All the people whose lives you've saved?

16:57.516 --> 16:58.892
What happens to our family?

17:06.692 --> 17:08.193
Baby! We're having a baby! Where--

17:08.277 --> 17:09.445
[receptionist] Third floor.

17:15.617 --> 17:16.994
[OB-GYN] You need to push, Dale.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.412
He said he'd be here.

17:20.414 --> 17:23.667
Bozzio-Babineaux! Bozzio-Babineaux!

17:24.918 --> 17:26.003
Bozzio-Babineaux!

17:26.086 --> 17:27.129
Right this way, sir.

17:27.212 --> 17:28.213
Thank you.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.302
[OB-GYN] It is imperative you push.
The time is now.

17:33.802 --> 17:35.054
[distant chatter]

17:38.974 --> 17:39.975
Now I push.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.101
[OB-GYN] Yeah, okay.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.270
Hey, babe. How you doing?

17:43.353 --> 17:45.230
I've been better. [grunts]

17:45.606 --> 17:47.983
I don't know about you,
but I'm ready to meet our kid.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.152
God, I love you.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.404
-I love you, too.
-Okay.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.406
[OB-GYN] Push.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.408
[Dale grunting]

17:56.492 --> 17:57.493
Push.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.245
[Dale and Clive screaming]

18:09.922 --> 18:10.923
[Major] Ravi.

18:11.757 --> 18:12.841
Where's Liv?

18:13.842 --> 18:15.677
[sniffles] She's on her way to Blaine's.

18:16.553 --> 18:17.554
Why Blaine's?

18:22.351 --> 18:24.561
They... They killed Peyton.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.065
[Ravi sobbing]

18:36.990 --> 18:38.408
Blaine and Don E, they, uh...

18:38.492 --> 18:41.703
They kidnapped the Freylich kids
and the orphans. [sniffles]

18:42.704 --> 18:43.914
Peyton rescued them.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.250
[Ravi continues sobbing]

18:46.333 --> 18:47.751
Give me a second.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.755
I pray that's full of Max Rager.

18:52.422 --> 18:53.465
It is.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.675
Okay.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.093
It's, uh...

18:56.176 --> 18:58.971
It'll take some time before there's enough
for public distribution.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.306
How long to make just one?

19:01.390 --> 19:02.432
What?

19:04.726 --> 19:07.020
[Blaine] Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

19:07.604 --> 19:10.774
I must say,
Bubba tastes much better than he looked.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.484
[soft classical music playing]

19:12.860 --> 19:16.155
What do you think?
This being your first brain meal and all.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.698
Oh, the brain's palatable.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.658
You, on the other hand...

19:19.741 --> 19:21.493
I know what will fix that.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.412
[ringing]

19:23.495 --> 19:27.666
Don E, more wine. Bring the good stuff.

19:30.961 --> 19:35.340
Yes, master.
An aught-14 Zin, if it pleases.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.385
Oh, my God. A Zin?
Don E, you're out of your element.

19:39.469 --> 19:41.138
[watch timer beeping]

19:42.139 --> 19:44.433
It's Bubba's watch. Cool, right?

19:46.101 --> 19:47.853
Time to go shock the well again.

19:53.483 --> 19:54.610
I'll handle it.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.447
Keep an eye on the old ball and chain
till I get back.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.293
Don't look at me with that tone of voice.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.794
[gasps]

20:15.923 --> 20:16.757
[grunts]

20:17.716 --> 20:19.384
Your first vision.

20:19.760 --> 20:20.844
You see anything good?

20:22.554 --> 20:24.306
Blaine, smothering a girl with a pillow.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.183
Well, we all have our hobbies.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.394
She was wearing a wedding dress.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.566
She was calling out for you.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.197
[Blaine] <i>You know</i>
<i>where you went wrong, Pop?</i>

20:41.406 --> 20:43.033
You started to believe in big ideas.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.954
More than wealth.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.039
More than pleasure.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.000
It's a short ride, life.

20:52.834 --> 20:56.546
You got to get what you can,
while you can.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.341
Someone's gonna come up on you,

20:59.424 --> 21:01.635
put a gun to your head
and pull the trigger.

21:03.178 --> 21:05.639
Some army is going to line you up
and gun you down.

21:07.015 --> 21:08.141
It's okay by me.

21:09.476 --> 21:12.229
You hear that? It's okay by me.

21:13.397 --> 21:18.527
'Cause I filled my life
with wine, women, song.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.654
At least I wasn't bored.

21:21.738 --> 21:23.073
I'd rather be dead--

21:23.156 --> 21:24.741
[Blaine screaming]

21:25.367 --> 21:27.327
-[shouting] You were saying?
-[splash]

21:30.998 --> 21:33.250
[Don E] She was the love of my life!

21:34.543 --> 21:38.255
You lazy, cruel, preening fop!

21:39.089 --> 21:39.923
[sighs]

21:41.633 --> 21:44.344
No one was ever gonna love you!

21:44.428 --> 21:46.972
Not Peyton, not your dad!

21:47.889 --> 21:53.103
Hell, I'm the only person
who could stand you,

21:53.770 --> 21:56.189
and you killed my fiancée!

21:56.481 --> 21:57.482
[Liv] Don E.

21:57.566 --> 21:58.734
What?

21:58.817 --> 22:00.777
-Wrong day, wrong time, Liv.
-[clicking]

22:01.486 --> 22:02.612
[gun fires]

22:03.363 --> 22:04.990
[screaming]

22:05.949 --> 22:06.950
[splash]

22:10.037 --> 22:11.705
Enjoy eternity together.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.294
[sobbing]

22:26.136 --> 22:29.181
[Peyton] How funny would it be if now,
I knocked you in?

22:33.810 --> 22:34.936
[Peyton grunts]

22:37.105 --> 22:39.024
Sorry. I would've come sooner, but...

22:51.369 --> 22:55.123
You need me to take a cure
for zombie-ism on live TV?

22:55.624 --> 22:56.625
This cure.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.168
Why me?

22:58.251 --> 23:00.629
You may be Seattle's
most well-known zombie.

23:00.712 --> 23:02.631
I'm not even Seattle's
most well-known zombie

23:02.714 --> 23:04.049
in a six-foot radius.

23:04.132 --> 23:06.968
This one can't take it,
but people mostly hate him,

23:07.052 --> 23:09.012
and they'll think
he has a political agenda.

23:09.096 --> 23:12.224
Look, even if I take that cure,

23:12.307 --> 23:15.060
and it doesn't kill me horribly on camera,

23:15.519 --> 23:17.354
and it works, and it turns me human again,

23:17.437 --> 23:20.148
half my viewers still wouldn't believe it.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.901
You know how it is these days.
"Fake news."

23:23.276 --> 23:25.654
We will do a blood pressure test, live.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.072
Fakeable.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.156
A ghost pepper.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.408
You'll eat one pre-cure.
Down the hatch. No issues.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.119
Then, post-cure, you'll eat one--

23:32.202 --> 23:33.328
Fakeable.

23:34.704 --> 23:37.207
Finally. We're not camels.

23:38.583 --> 23:39.626
We'll cut you open.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.254
You'll bleed like only humans bleed.

23:42.337 --> 23:44.297
We're talking about the fate of mankind.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.882
[stage manager] Stand down, Johnny.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.425
Dear Leader is stealing your time slot.

23:47.509 --> 23:50.387
He's got some big announcement.
He's on his way in.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.056
[Johnny] Oh, shoot.

23:53.140 --> 23:56.476
Looks like we won't be cutting open
ol' Johnny on live TV today, boys.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.733
What are we gonna do now?

24:04.276 --> 24:05.527
I have no idea.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.088
[Major] I always loved you.

24:26.590 --> 24:27.883
And I always will.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.303
Take care of yourself.

24:32.929 --> 24:33.972
Bye.

24:37.517 --> 24:40.604
I'll say it again, Major.
This is a terrible idea.

24:41.813 --> 24:42.981
You got a better one?

24:44.399 --> 24:45.525
None that you'd approve.

24:47.527 --> 24:48.570
Give it to me.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.919
Good evening. I'm Johnny Frost,
and this is your 6:00 p.m. news.

25:04.419 --> 25:05.420
Our top story...

25:05.503 --> 25:06.922
[man] What's going on? What is this?

25:07.881 --> 25:11.635
According to the Chief Medical Examiner
of the Seattle Police Department,

25:11.718 --> 25:15.055
an inexpensive cure for the zombie virus
has been perfected.

25:15.138 --> 25:16.264
Get him off.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.516
[Johnny] And will be made available
within the next few weeks

25:18.600 --> 25:20.143
<i>for those infected with the virus.</i>

25:21.561 --> 25:23.063
<i>Mass production of the cure...</i>

25:23.146 --> 25:24.648
-Did he just say?
<i>-...will begin within the week.</i>

25:24.731 --> 25:25.815
They did it.

25:25.899 --> 25:28.235
<i>...no official statement</i>
<i>from the US government. All right.</i>

25:29.736 --> 25:30.987
What's happening?

25:31.655 --> 25:32.989
Whatever it is, it's not good.

25:36.910 --> 25:38.536
[Enzo] Bravo, <i>mon ami.</i>

25:38.620 --> 25:40.622
You will be our first guest
at the guillotine.

25:40.705 --> 25:44.251
If you could schedule that
before I write my next alimony check...

25:44.334 --> 25:45.335
[distant gunfire]

25:47.504 --> 25:51.174
Commander. Dead Enders just rolled up,
20, maybe 30.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.259
That is all?

25:53.134 --> 25:54.970
You two, head out with Murphy.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.179
[both] Yes, sir.

25:56.763 --> 25:57.847
You are zombies.

25:58.431 --> 26:01.393
Take the fight to them. Hmm?
Be the aggressor.

26:01.476 --> 26:02.644
Yes, sir.

26:04.646 --> 26:05.689
[man] Let's go.

26:05.772 --> 26:06.898
[Johnny grunts]

26:07.983 --> 26:10.527
Not till we see the reds of their eyes,
got it?

26:10.902 --> 26:11.903
Tell me when.

26:12.112 --> 26:13.154
-Say when.
-Okay.

26:20.328 --> 26:21.162
Here we go.

26:22.747 --> 26:27.752
On my mark. Three. Two. One.
Go, go, go, go.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.298
-[soldier screaming]
-[Enzo] We do not wish for violence.

26:31.881 --> 26:34.801
But we are fighting
for the survival of our species.

26:34.884 --> 26:39.222
We will take every necessary means
to ensure our survival.

26:39.306 --> 26:43.518
Today, I am offering
safe passage out of Seattle

26:43.852 --> 26:49.482
to any human who provides information
leading to the capture of Mr. Lillywhite.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.943
How 'bout I make it easier for you, Enzo?

26:53.028 --> 26:56.573
Well, look.
The man who got us into this mess.

26:57.157 --> 26:59.200
Why don't you want people knowing
there's a viable cure?

26:59.701 --> 27:01.286
There is no such thing.

27:01.786 --> 27:02.954
Sure there is.

27:03.496 --> 27:04.748
I've got one right here.

27:05.874 --> 27:06.916
Tell you what.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.376
I'll take it right now,

27:08.460 --> 27:10.337
and you can shoot me
as many times as you want,

27:10.420 --> 27:11.463
just not in the head.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.506
If I'm still a zombie, I'll survive

27:13.590 --> 27:16.217
and you can guillotine me
in the public square like you want.

27:16.426 --> 27:18.178
But, if I die...

27:19.095 --> 27:22.015
Well, that means there's a cure.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.267
It proves nothing.

27:24.934 --> 27:26.061
Stay with me here.

27:26.519 --> 27:28.480
Those cures sold for millions of dollars.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.900
What motivation would I have
to spend millions of dollars,

27:31.983 --> 27:34.861
then take a cure
and ask to be murdered on live TV?

27:35.945 --> 27:37.280
Well... [stammers]

27:39.324 --> 27:41.785
[sighs] I'm here to prove to people
that it's over.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.912
<i>To ask them to put down their weapons.</i>

27:44.579 --> 27:47.791
<i>In a matter of weeks the zombie virus</i>
<i>can be a historical footnote.</i>

27:47.874 --> 27:49.626
<i>Like small pox and malaria.</i>

<i>Watch.</i>

28:08.353 --> 28:09.396
[all gasping]

28:12.649 --> 28:13.983
Are we still rolling?

28:14.067 --> 28:15.235
[director] <i>Yes, we're still live.</i>

28:15.318 --> 28:16.361
<i>We're still live.</i>

28:20.573 --> 28:21.783
Get up, zombie.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.243
[shouts] Get up!

28:26.746 --> 28:28.081
He's alive.

28:47.308 --> 28:48.518
What is so funny?

28:49.978 --> 28:51.563
Don't you know you're about to die?

28:51.646 --> 28:53.815
[sighing]

28:57.694 --> 29:01.614
Because the head of Fillmore Graves
isn't a zombie anymore.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.784
Where's your red eyes
and your super strength?

29:04.868 --> 29:06.411
Shouldn't I be dead by now?

29:06.953 --> 29:08.121

[woman screams]

29:29.392 --> 29:30.643
Where's that flamethrower?

29:31.394 --> 29:32.520
[Benny] Don't know.

29:33.396 --> 29:35.482
There it is. Cover me.

29:45.533 --> 29:46.868
Know how to use this thing?

29:55.084 --> 29:58.296
Mom. Help me.

30:07.430 --> 30:08.848
We're gonna kill 'em all, Benny.

30:09.682 --> 30:12.352
I swear to God. Every last one of them.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.569
Ravi, why aren't you picking up?

30:21.653 --> 30:22.737
Why isn't Major picking up?

30:22.821 --> 30:23.863
I'm at the morgue.

30:23.947 --> 30:25.990
Peyton went to see if
she could find you at your house.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.450
[cell phone ringing]

30:34.999 --> 30:36.417
Clive. Did you make it in time?

30:36.501 --> 30:38.962
<i>How are you? How's Dale? How's the baby?</i>

30:39.379 --> 30:41.840
Liv. We're all fine. We're all good.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.925
Um...

30:44.008 --> 30:45.468
Have you been watching TV?

30:45.552 --> 30:46.928
What's wrong, Clive?

30:47.011 --> 30:49.472
I've been calling. Um...

30:49.556 --> 30:52.642
My battery was dead. Just...
Clive, tell me what's going on.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.311
So, um...

30:57.146 --> 30:58.857
[Major on voicemail] <i>Hey, Liv. It's me. </i>

30:59.691 --> 31:01.192
<i>I'm about to do something stupid...</i>

31:02.652 --> 31:05.488
<i>But if it works, big if...</i>

31:06.364 --> 31:07.657
<i>It'll save lives.</i>

31:08.700 --> 31:11.452
<i>But basically, the way I make</i>
<i>all my decisions these days </i>

31:11.536 --> 31:14.956
<i>is by asking myself,</i>
<i>"What would Liv Moore do?"</i>

31:16.666 --> 31:17.667
Major.

31:21.462 --> 31:22.589
Major.

31:22.797 --> 31:25.425
You tricky son of a bitch.

31:25.508 --> 31:26.926
[sighs in relief]

31:27.010 --> 31:28.803
What was in the syringe you gave me?

31:29.304 --> 31:32.307
Max Rager. It's all I had on hand.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.226
You just had to be the hero, didn't you?

31:37.228 --> 31:40.398
Next time, though...
Next time it's all yours.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.943
You're not taking a selfie, are you?

31:44.027 --> 31:45.570
[Major chuckles]

31:45.653 --> 31:47.155
-[groans]
-All right. Careful there.

<i>I always loved you.</i>

31:57.624 --> 31:58.958
<i>And I always will.</i>

32:00.251 --> 32:01.544
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

32:02.462 --> 32:03.588
<i>Bye.</i>

32:04.839 --> 32:05.840
Liv?

32:07.759 --> 32:10.053
I was watching the news,
and I haven't seen Clive in days.

32:10.136 --> 32:11.304
I thought he might be...

32:12.805 --> 32:13.890
Hey, are you all right?

32:15.725 --> 32:17.352
-[door opens]
-[footsteps approaching]

32:17.435 --> 32:18.478
Hello?

32:19.020 --> 32:20.813
Sir? I don't think
you're supposed to be in--

32:20.897 --> 32:21.981
[screams]

32:29.822 --> 32:31.032
[officer] Is the Captain in?

32:31.741 --> 32:32.867
Which one?

32:32.951 --> 32:34.827
Whichever one
wants to sign off on my overtime.

32:37.664 --> 32:38.915
[knocks on door]

32:39.415 --> 32:41.042
[people laughing]

32:41.376 --> 32:42.460
[knocks on door]

32:44.212 --> 32:45.797
Sorry, Captain. Captain.

32:45.880 --> 32:46.965
Bad time?

32:47.632 --> 32:49.759
To squeeze more money
out of my overtime budget?

32:49.842 --> 32:50.718
Never.

32:51.552 --> 32:53.346
-I'll take care of this.
-[Clive] Go ahead.

32:53.429 --> 32:56.432
[clears throat]
Hey, have fun on your virtual-cast.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.476
Don't say anything I wouldn't say.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.812
Kind of a low bar, isn't it?

33:00.895 --> 33:02.021
Oh.

33:04.357 --> 33:05.900
-[chuckles]
-[door closes]

33:23.626 --> 33:25.378
[Clive] So, we're really doing this, huh?

33:26.462 --> 33:27.672
We should.

33:27.755 --> 33:29.132
Every little bit helps.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.260
It's been too long, my friend.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.346
Speaking of, how're the kids?

33:35.430 --> 33:37.515
Amazing. I'll show you.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.184
[girl] <i>All right. Come on.</i>

33:40.727 --> 33:42.186
[Ravi] Oh, Olivia.

33:43.062 --> 33:44.272
She's getting so big.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.942
My word. Jacob's gotta be a foot taller.

33:48.901 --> 33:50.236
You won't believe this.

33:50.820 --> 33:53.781
Some second cousin of Michelle's
tracked us down a couple months ago,

33:54.323 --> 33:56.159
tried to claim custody of Jacob.

33:56.492 --> 33:57.493
No.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.370
Yeah, guy's just looking for a payout.

33:59.787 --> 34:00.788
We're getting a lawyer.

34:01.914 --> 34:03.499
Ask and ye shall receive.

34:03.583 --> 34:04.709
Clive.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.169
And what're you receiving?

34:06.586 --> 34:07.754
Free legal advice.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.505
Oh, yeah. I'm happy to help.

34:09.589 --> 34:12.175
We should be fine. But thank you, Peyton.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.093
How're things with you?

34:14.761 --> 34:15.762
Same as ever.

34:15.845 --> 34:18.389
Job's great. Ravi's Ravi.

34:19.390 --> 34:21.309
-Which is to say great.
-Yeah.

34:22.727 --> 34:24.771
Oh, okay. The gang's all here.

34:24.979 --> 34:26.689
Hey, thank y'all so much for doing this.

34:26.773 --> 34:28.691
So, as we discussed,
I'll just do a brief intro,

34:28.775 --> 34:29.901
and then we'll just get right into it.

34:30.443 --> 34:32.236
-Let's dive in.
-Excellent.

34:33.488 --> 34:35.823

I'm your host, Byron DeCece.

34:48.169 --> 34:51.714
Today marks the tenth anniversary
of the infamous "Battle For Seattle,"

34:52.090 --> 34:55.968
a brief but deadly civil war
inside the walled city of yore,

34:56.177 --> 34:59.931
a battle that ended
when an affordable cure for zombie-ism

35:00.014 --> 35:01.849
was discovered and revealed to the world.

35:02.308 --> 35:03.935
Joining me today to give their account

35:04.018 --> 35:06.020
are three people
who were in the thick of it all.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.982
Clive Babineaux,
former Seattle PD homicide detective.

35:10.566 --> 35:13.903
Peyton Charles, one-time acting mayor
of the Emerald City,

35:14.362 --> 35:16.489
and of course, Dr. Curegood himself,

35:17.365 --> 35:18.741
Ravi Chakrabarti.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.326
Please don't call him that.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.411
It's reserved for the boudoir.

35:22.495 --> 35:25.832
Oh, okay. A sexier start than I expected.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.084
Now, before we jump back a decade,

35:28.167 --> 35:30.503
let's bring everyone up
to speed on your lives now.

35:30.586 --> 35:32.338
Clive, you're still
protecting and serving?

35:32.421 --> 35:35.675
That's right. San Francisco PD,
alongside my wife, Dale.

35:35.758 --> 35:36.843
Amazing.

35:36.926 --> 35:39.011
Peyton,
you're a district attorney in Atlanta?

35:39.095 --> 35:40.096
I am.

35:40.179 --> 35:44.183
Ravi, you've made a tidy sum
from book deals and speaking appearances,

35:44.600 --> 35:47.395
yet you still punch the clock every day
as the head of the CDC.

35:47.478 --> 35:51.941
I'd feel selfish sitting at home
when I can still make a contribution.

35:52.024 --> 35:54.318
He feeds off the adulation
of young researchers.

35:54.402 --> 35:57.572
Don't forget the allure of raw,
unbridled power.

35:57.655 --> 35:59.198
-Oh.
-I quite like that, too.

35:59.282 --> 36:01.325
Uh, let's travel back in time.

36:01.409 --> 36:03.744
Ten years ago, Seattle was on the brink.

36:03.828 --> 36:07.540
Right? You had zombies and humans
murdering each other in the streets

36:07.623 --> 36:10.710
until you administered the cure
to the head zombie,

36:10.793 --> 36:14.672
the former Commander
of Fillmore Graves, on live TV.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.968
Once people knew there was a cure,
there was no reason to fight.

36:19.051 --> 36:22.180
And, yet, not all zombies
opted for the cure.

36:22.263 --> 36:24.891
Since zombies no longer posed
an apocalyptic threat,

36:24.974 --> 36:26.601
brain donations resumed,

36:26.684 --> 36:27.768
sick and dying people

36:27.852 --> 36:30.104
from across the country
migrated in droves.

36:30.688 --> 36:33.357
Seattle was repopulated,
rebuilt and rebranded.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.067
They say it's very nice.

36:36.110 --> 36:37.570
Yet none of you elected to stay.

36:40.114 --> 36:41.115
No.

36:42.366 --> 36:45.870
After everything that went down,
I guess we all just needed a clean slate.

36:46.787 --> 36:47.914
[Byron] I can imagine.

36:48.539 --> 36:51.626
Let's talk about Liv Moore, AKA Renegade.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.921
She was the face
of the peaceful coexistence cause

36:55.046 --> 36:58.216
until she was tragically killed
by an anti-zombie zealot

36:58.299 --> 36:59.592
in a suicide bombing.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.511
Unless, of course,
you believe the rumor that she survived.

37:02.595 --> 37:03.638
Yeah, we don't.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.932
The entire police station
collapsed onto the morgue.

37:06.515 --> 37:08.267
We dug through the rubble for weeks, but--

37:08.351 --> 37:10.019
Even if she'd somehow
lived through the blast,

37:10.102 --> 37:12.772
she'd have turned into
a rabid zombie, buried for that long.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.816
We eventually had to admit to ourselves

37:15.900 --> 37:17.818
that all hope was lost.

37:18.569 --> 37:19.737
We all did.

37:21.906 --> 37:22.990
Major didn't.

37:25.660 --> 37:26.744
<i>He kept digging,</i>

37:27.745 --> 37:29.872
<i>along with a group of orphans</i>
<i>Liv had taken in.</i>

37:32.208 --> 37:34.418
<i>Major would've cleared out</i>
<i>every last beam,</i>

37:35.753 --> 37:37.296
<i>every chunk of concrete...</i>

37:38.589 --> 37:41.467
[Ravi] <i>But there were still</i>
<i>Dead Enders who wouldn't...</i>

37:41.926 --> 37:43.803
<i>Still haven't given up the fight.</i>

37:44.428 --> 37:46.180
Right, right. Dolly Durkins.

37:46.931 --> 37:49.475
The, uh... "The Fishmonger."
You think she's still alive?

37:49.558 --> 37:51.519
'Cause some people think
that she's just a legend,

37:51.602 --> 37:54.021
a name that's used
to scare zombie children.

37:54.438 --> 37:55.773
She's still out there.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.651
<i>The Dead Enders had a deck of cards,</i>

37:59.610 --> 38:01.737
<i>52 zombies they wanted eliminated.</i>

38:02.780 --> 38:04.865
<i>Only 12 of those zombies survive today.</i>

38:05.825 --> 38:08.035
[Byron] <i>Your friend, Major Lillywhite...</i>

38:08.119 --> 38:10.871
<i>The, uh... Let's call him</i>
<i>the good Commander of Fillmore Graves.</i>

38:10.955 --> 38:13.249
<i>I believe that's how</i>
<i>the history books will remember him.</i>

38:13.916 --> 38:15.584
<i>He hasn't been seen in a decade, either. </i>

38:17.586 --> 38:18.587
That's right.

38:20.881 --> 38:22.550
Some say he went underground,

38:22.633 --> 38:24.927
some say that the Dead Enders
finally caught up with him...

38:25.553 --> 38:26.887
Your guess is as good as ours.

38:26.971 --> 38:31.934
You know there've been Liv sightings
everywhere from Tijuana to Bangor, Maine.

38:32.351 --> 38:34.228
Well, I mean, was Elvis with her?

38:34.687 --> 38:36.355
[Peyton] That's what happens
when you're a legend.

38:36.439 --> 38:39.233
People want to believe
she was capable of the impossible.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.027
We all wish the rumors were true.

38:41.610 --> 38:42.820
More than anything.

38:43.863 --> 38:45.031
But they're not.

38:45.656 --> 38:46.657
Liv's gone.

38:48.367 --> 38:51.829
<i>If Liv had survived,</i>
<i>we would have heard from her by now.</i>

38:55.166 --> 38:56.167
[all gasping]

38:56.792 --> 38:58.002
[Liv] Are you okay?

38:58.085 --> 38:59.170
Missed you.

38:59.253 --> 39:00.338
You're okay?

39:24.528 --> 39:25.738
[Byron]<i> Okay. Let's just say</i>

39:25.821 --> 39:29.533
that you could imagine that
Major and Liv, by some miracle,

39:29.617 --> 39:31.243
managed to still be alive.

39:32.078 --> 39:33.496
What would you want to say to them?

39:37.458 --> 39:38.626
[Peyton]<i> We'd tell them we love them.</i>

39:39.543 --> 39:40.586
[Ravi] <i>That we miss them.</i>

39:42.505 --> 39:44.673
[Clive] <i>That if they're still kicking,</i>

39:46.300 --> 39:48.177
<i>they sure as hell better look us up.</i>

39:51.972 --> 39:53.182
You guys. Thank you so much.

39:53.265 --> 39:54.600
This was great.

39:54.892 --> 39:56.394
I'm sorry for running
a little over the hour,

39:56.477 --> 39:57.978
and sorry for pushing so hard about

39:58.062 --> 39:59.897
all the "Are Major and Liv
still alive?" stuff.

40:00.439 --> 40:01.690
It's what the people want to know.

40:01.774 --> 40:03.484
-We're used to it.
-I bet.

40:04.151 --> 40:05.152
Take care.

40:06.654 --> 40:07.738
Damn.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.281
Ten years.

40:11.951 --> 40:13.828
[Major] And I haven't aged a day.

40:15.704 --> 40:17.248
Neither do your jokes.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.916
'Cause you say that every time.

40:19.208 --> 40:20.376
'Cause they're gold, baby.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.087
-How's the family?
-Wonderful.

40:23.629 --> 40:24.713
How was the virtual-cast?

40:24.797 --> 40:26.757
We gave him the same old song and dance.

40:27.341 --> 40:29.343
I think our acting's gotten
really good these last few years.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.636
-You were great.
-Thank you.

40:30.719 --> 40:31.554
I was solid.

40:32.346 --> 40:34.056
You were chewing scenery again.

40:34.181 --> 40:35.182
Sounds right.

40:35.558 --> 40:38.144
Uh, it's called making a choice
and committing.

40:40.312 --> 40:41.397
Hey, buddy.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.565
Missed you, too.

40:43.524 --> 40:47.194
[gasps] It's remarkable.
You really are preserved in amber.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.404
[chuckles]

40:48.487 --> 40:50.448
They both are. It's not fair.

40:51.198 --> 40:53.409
I still look good, I ain't mad atcha.

40:54.785 --> 40:56.829
But I do miss you, partner.

40:56.912 --> 40:59.498
Aw. Vice versa, Clive.

41:00.249 --> 41:03.085
If only there was some way
we could see more of each other.

41:03.169 --> 41:06.088
-Like, every day, for instance.
-[Major] Hmm.

41:06.172 --> 41:09.258
We know this beautiful
slice of heaven called Zombie Island.

41:09.341 --> 41:11.927
Spectacular ocean views,
great for families.

41:12.011 --> 41:13.012
Affordable.

41:13.095 --> 41:14.346
And if you act now,

41:14.430 --> 41:16.891
we can throw in
an abrupt halt to the aging process.

41:16.974 --> 41:18.809
All it takes is a scratch.

41:22.146 --> 41:23.189
Okay.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.899
[chuckles]

41:33.908 --> 41:35.910
