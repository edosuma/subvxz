WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:04.000
This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

00:04.900 --> 00:06.800
We are going to survive,

00:06.900 --> 00:09.300
we are going to make it home.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
I'm telling you, the ship
came here for a reason!

00:13.380 --> 00:16.983
This ship is powered
by the stars themselves.

00:16.984 --> 00:19.100
He and Young are
bumping heads, yes.

00:19.386 --> 00:22.054
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

00:22.055 --> 00:23.288
We just pretend nothing happened.

00:23.289 --> 00:26.225
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

00:26.226 --> 00:27.593
For the sake of the crew.

00:27.594 --> 00:29.795
For the sake of the crew.

00:30.833 --> 00:33.002
Got it, Colonel,
Lucian alliance?

00:33.003 --> 00:34.003
That would be my guess.

00:34.004 --> 00:35.405
They haven't
introduced themselves.

00:35.406 --> 00:38.941
Any word on how they
gained intel on our base?

00:38.942 --> 00:40.076
No. What about casualties?

00:41.077 --> 00:44.924
12. 80-plus MIA.

00:44.925 --> 00:46.084
I'm pregnant.

00:46.085 --> 00:47.843
It's yours.

00:47.844 --> 00:49.833
Ours.

00:49.834 --> 00:51.787
Look, I know that we've had
our differences in the past.

00:51.788 --> 00:52.916
Yeah.

00:52.917 --> 00:54.076
It was my duty
to express concern

00:54.077 --> 00:56.532
For how everyone
else felt about you.

00:56.533 --> 00:58.687
I've never even met your wife.

00:58.688 --> 01:00.611
Telford, you
connected with him.

01:00.612 --> 01:02.601
Was it a residual
memory of his

01:02.602 --> 01:04.790
That somehow transferred
to my subconscious?

01:04.791 --> 01:06.216
I would think you'd be
doing everything possible

01:06.217 --> 01:08.836
to get these people home,
to get yourself home,

01:08.837 --> 01:10.097
back to your wife.

01:10.098 --> 01:12.285
And I know you're
still sleeping with her.

01:12.286 --> 01:13.876
Everett!

02:06.710 --> 02:07.804
You're up late.

02:07.805 --> 02:08.999
Yeah.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.020
I just had a very
interesting dream.

02:11.020 --> 02:12.845
Everyone thinks their
dreams are interesting.

02:12.846 --> 02:14.934
Nobody else cares.

02:14.935 --> 02:15.928
Yeah, well, you're
going to care

02:15.929 --> 02:17.521
about this one.

02:21.402 --> 02:23.589
I'm outside a warehouse,

02:23.590 --> 02:26.044
on Earth,

02:26.045 --> 02:27.768
and there's birds...

02:27.769 --> 02:30.322
At least I can hear them.
Seagulls, I think.

02:32.313 --> 02:34.038
I'm at some kind of meeting.

02:34.039 --> 02:36.059
There's four
or five people there.

02:36.060 --> 02:37.122
Who?

02:37.123 --> 02:38.050
I don't know, I don't know,

02:38.051 --> 02:39.775
but I'm giving
them information.

02:39.776 --> 02:41.897
Reports, files.

02:41.898 --> 02:43.755
I'm talking about Icarus.

02:43.756 --> 02:46.211
In detail.

02:46.212 --> 02:47.602
Well, who were they?

02:47.603 --> 02:49.194
I don't know, I...

02:49.195 --> 02:52.046
They had a goa'uld cargo ship.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.970
The Lucian alliance
on Earth?

02:53.971 --> 02:55.197
I can only guess.

02:55.198 --> 02:56.425
You dreamt you were
the spy who leaked

02:56.426 --> 02:58.515
Everything about Icarus
to the Lucian alliance?

02:58.516 --> 02:59.874
No, not me, it wasn't me.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.367
Rush, what the hell
are you talking about?

03:01.368 --> 03:03.589
On the way back to the car,
I seen my reflection.

03:07.238 --> 03:09.691
It was Colonel Telford.

03:09.692 --> 03:14.002
I was Colonel Telford.

03:19.142 --> 03:25.205
Stargate Universe
s01e18 Subversion

03:26.810 --> 03:29.563
Rush switched two days ago.

03:29.564 --> 03:30.590
The only reason I am telling you

03:30.591 --> 03:32.082
is because you are
the only person

03:32.083 --> 03:34.305
who's ever experienced this
kind of bleed-through memory

03:34.306 --> 03:35.632
after using the stones.

03:35.633 --> 03:37.123
It was just
that once, sir.

03:37.124 --> 03:39.146
Certainly nothing like that.

03:39.347 --> 03:43.061
Thanks, Lieutenant.

03:47.405 --> 03:49.594
All right, look, sir,

03:49.595 --> 03:51.052
I understand

03:51.053 --> 03:53.077
that you have your issues
with Colonel Telford,

03:53.078 --> 03:54.037
but you cannot seriously...

03:54.038 --> 03:55.563
Sit down, Lieutenant.

03:58.913 --> 04:01.302
Before he was
assigned to Icarus,

04:01.303 --> 04:03.292
Telford spent the
better part of a year

04:03.293 --> 04:04.154
undercover,

04:04.155 --> 04:06.043
infiltrating the alliance.

04:06.044 --> 04:09.361
You really think he would turn?

04:09.362 --> 04:11.316
Eight months
into his assignment,

04:11.317 --> 04:12.976
there was an
attack on a planet

04:12.977 --> 04:14.236
that we had a large
team working on,

04:14.237 --> 04:15.662
P2S-569.

04:15.663 --> 04:17.851
37 people were killed.

04:17.851 --> 04:19.012
Now, we later found out

04:19.014 --> 04:20.305
that Telford knew
about the attack,

04:20.307 --> 04:22.694
and decided to do nothing.

04:22.695 --> 04:25.777
In order to protect
his cover.

04:25.778 --> 04:27.170
That's what he said.

04:27.171 --> 04:28.896
Stargate command
let him off the hook,

04:28.897 --> 04:30.952
And everything
was swept under the carpet.

04:30.953 --> 04:32.211
But now...

04:32.212 --> 04:35.131
Sir, there's got to be
more to it than that.

04:35.132 --> 04:37.086
We know that the goa'uld
had brainwashing technology,

04:37.087 --> 04:39.111
Could make a man turn against
his mother and be proud of it.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.000
It is possible

04:41.001 --> 04:43.986
The alliance
now has that capability.

04:43.987 --> 04:46.706
Well, if they do, sir,
then we can't trust anyone.

04:48.729 --> 04:50.685
Colonel, hey,
we were just going over

04:50.686 --> 04:51.779
Some of the data
we found when...

04:51.780 --> 04:54.765
Take a break, Eli.

04:55.303 --> 04:57.704
Secrets,
you two...

04:57.705 --> 04:58.672
Now, please, go.

05:01.943 --> 05:03.477
Okay.

05:05.146 --> 05:08.048
So I talked to Scott.

05:08.049 --> 05:10.150
He doesn't remember
anything like your dream.

05:10.151 --> 05:11.651
Well, we have to
do something.

05:11.652 --> 05:13.153
Agreed.

05:13.154 --> 05:15.722
Telford's still on active
rotation with the stones, yeah?

05:17.525 --> 05:18.592
He's due to make
a connection

05:18.593 --> 05:20.260
In a couple of days
with Dr. Morrison.

05:21.729 --> 05:24.598
What if
I take morrison's place?

05:24.599 --> 05:26.533
Try to make contact
with the alliance.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.101
It's risky.

05:28.102 --> 05:29.436
Well, it's
a pretty good disguise,

05:29.437 --> 05:31.638
Actually being inside
someone else's body.

05:31.639 --> 05:32.839
I'll go.

05:32.840 --> 05:33.607
No, that would be
a mistake.

05:33.608 --> 05:34.574
Why's that?

05:34.575 --> 05:35.409
Because I had the dream.

05:35.410 --> 05:36.743
Look, there's
still elements

05:36.744 --> 05:38.245
I'm trying
to piece together.

05:38.246 --> 05:40.547
For example,
there's a number, 314.

05:40.548 --> 05:43.083
Now, I know it's significant,
but I don't know why.

05:43.084 --> 05:45.685
If I'm there, in Telford's
environment, then...

05:45.686 --> 05:46.753
You're not trained for this.

05:46.754 --> 05:48.622
Well, who is?

05:48.623 --> 05:50.624
I'll just have to

05:50.625 --> 05:51.758
Do my best.

05:51.759 --> 05:53.026
If stargate command

05:53.027 --> 05:54.294
Is this badly compromised,

05:54.295 --> 05:55.562
I can't tell anyone
what you're up to,

05:55.563 --> 05:56.630
Do you understand that?

05:56.631 --> 05:58.398
Yup.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.566
Once you are on Earth,
you are on your own.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.667
No back-up...

06:00.668 --> 06:02.002
I understand.
I get it, I get it.

06:02.003 --> 06:03.403
Now, someone
has to stop this guy.

06:03.404 --> 06:05.172
He can't be allowed to continue.

06:05.173 --> 06:07.174
The alliance probably already
know more about this ship

06:07.175 --> 06:08.375
Than we do.

06:08.376 --> 06:09.676
Which isn't much.

06:09.677 --> 06:10.577
Well, I wouldn't
underestimate them.

06:10.578 --> 06:13.113
I'm not.

06:15.150 --> 06:16.950
Colonel,
I need a minute.

06:16.951 --> 06:17.684
That's about
all I got right now.

06:18.085 --> 06:18.886
Did you bump Dr. Morrison

06:19.187 --> 06:20.954
from his spot on the
communication stones?

06:20.955 --> 06:21.788
Yes.

06:21.789 --> 06:22.322
Without
consulting me?

06:22.423 --> 06:23.090
Yes.

06:23.191 --> 06:24.124
Any particular
reason?

06:24.225 --> 06:25.292
Yes.

06:25.393 --> 06:26.593
You care
to enlighten me?

06:26.694 --> 06:28.061
No.

06:31.365 --> 06:33.133
With everything that
we have been through,

06:33.134 --> 06:34.801
You really want to do this?

06:34.802 --> 06:36.336
Look, Camile, I've got
good reason not to tell you,

06:36.337 --> 06:37.437
Or I would.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.272
You're going to
have to trust me.

06:54.355 --> 06:56.356
Dr. Morrison?

06:58.826 --> 07:00.694
Yes.

07:00.695 --> 07:01.828
Welcome back.

07:01.829 --> 07:03.196
I'm staff sergeant graham.

07:03.197 --> 07:05.699
I'll be your escort.

07:05.700 --> 07:06.833
Right.

07:22.583 --> 07:26.219
I want to talk to
Colonel Young, now.

07:26.220 --> 07:27.487
He is busy
at the moment, sir,

07:27.488 --> 07:28.522
but he said he'd
come see you shortly.

07:28.523 --> 07:30.657
Why was I connected
with Dr. Rush?

07:30.658 --> 07:32.425
That wasn't part of
the schedule.

07:32.426 --> 07:34.194
Yes, sorry about that,
sir. It was unavoidable.

07:34.195 --> 07:36.296
Why?

07:36.297 --> 07:38.632
Dr. Rush had to consult with
some people back on Earth

07:38.633 --> 07:41.535
Regarding
some technical problems.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.341
You're a terrible liar,
Lieutenant.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.610
I'd like some fatigues.

07:50.611 --> 07:52.445
No problem.

07:52.446 --> 07:54.714
This way, sir.

08:15.736 --> 08:17.437
I need to speak to
General O'Neill immediately.

08:17.438 --> 08:19.339
And you are?

08:19.340 --> 08:21.775
Colonel Everett Young,
authentication 1619414.

08:21.776 --> 08:23.176
Tell him it's urgent.

08:23.177 --> 08:24.544
Everett,
I'll have you know

08:24.545 --> 08:27.380
I'm missing a national
security briefing for this.

08:27.381 --> 08:28.982
Sorry about that, sir.

08:28.983 --> 08:31.418
Well, if you'd ever been to
a national security briefing,

08:31.419 --> 08:33.687
you wouldn't say that.

08:33.688 --> 08:35.087
What's up?

08:35.089 --> 08:36.356
It Dr. Rush, sir.

08:36.357 --> 08:38.758
He's on Earth right now
in the body of Colonel Telford.

08:38.759 --> 08:40.559
Probably hasn't even
left the building.

08:40.561 --> 08:41.628
So?

08:41.629 --> 08:42.828
We need to put a tail on him.

08:42.830 --> 08:44.497
Well, he's got an escort.

08:44.498 --> 08:46.266
He'll ditch the escort
first chance he gets.

08:46.267 --> 08:47.834
I think we should let him do it,
then follow him discreetly.

08:47.835 --> 08:49.302
Why?

08:49.303 --> 08:50.403
He's about to try
and make contact

08:50.404 --> 08:51.638
with the Lucian alliance.

08:59.903 --> 09:01.971
Aw, Chloe...

09:04.274 --> 09:06.843
Oh, my God...

09:08.345 --> 09:10.780
Chloe, I didn't know
you could sew.

09:10.781 --> 09:12.014
Oh, no, I can't.

09:12.015 --> 09:14.250
Not really.

09:14.251 --> 09:15.818
I hope it doesn't fall apart.

09:15.819 --> 09:17.620
No, it's beautiful,
thank you.

09:17.621 --> 09:19.422
You're welcome.

09:19.423 --> 09:21.591
Here, open this one.

09:24.261 --> 09:27.196
Hey, can we talk
to you for a second?

09:27.197 --> 09:29.866
Oh, my gosh...

09:31.602 --> 09:33.136
You made this yourself?

09:33.137 --> 09:34.237
If it's a girl,

09:34.238 --> 09:35.338
I can make
something else.

09:35.339 --> 09:36.839
No, it's perfect!

09:36.840 --> 09:39.475
Thank you...

09:39.476 --> 09:40.543
What's
going on?

09:40.544 --> 09:42.612
We're hoping
you could tell us.

09:42.613 --> 09:44.013
About Rush?

09:44.014 --> 09:45.548
Going back to Earth
on the stones unscheduled?

09:45.549 --> 09:49.285
Well, I'm-I'm sure
there's a good reason.

09:49.286 --> 09:50.620
Right, yeah, that's what
we're afraid of.

09:50.621 --> 09:51.621
They didn't say
anything to you?

09:51.622 --> 09:54.424
Young came in
to talk to him

09:54.425 --> 09:56.659
The other day...

09:56.660 --> 09:59.195
They did
kick me out.

09:59.196 --> 10:00.296
Yeah, we heard
Young went, too.

10:00.297 --> 10:02.231
He did?

10:02.232 --> 10:03.700
After Rush.
He's there right now.

10:03.701 --> 10:05.601
Something's
definitely going on here.

10:18.716 --> 10:20.516
Congratulations, TJ.

10:20.517 --> 10:23.419
Camile, if I could have
a moment of your time, please?

10:23.420 --> 10:24.921
Were you aware
of the change...

10:24.922 --> 10:26.255
Yeah, we could
check those...

10:26.256 --> 10:28.224
Control interface room
probably has something...

10:28.225 --> 10:30.360
Yeah, I could meet
you guys at the...

10:30.361 --> 10:31.794
That'd be great.

10:34.865 --> 10:35.732
If I'm not mistaken, sir,

10:35.733 --> 10:36.933
I believe you've witnessed

10:36.934 --> 10:37.834
The effects of this
brainwashing technology

10:37.835 --> 10:40.503
First hand.

10:40.504 --> 10:42.572
Yeah.

10:42.573 --> 10:44.774
Yeah, that's...
That's true.

10:44.775 --> 10:46.109
I recommend we keep

10:46.110 --> 10:47.477
The number of people
we bring in on this

10:47.478 --> 10:49.045
To a minimum.

10:49.046 --> 10:51.514
Well, thank you, Colonel,
for stating the obvious.

10:53.183 --> 10:54.617
Truth is,

10:54.618 --> 10:56.352
You took a bit of a chance
by telling me, didn't you?

10:56.353 --> 10:57.453
Well, I had to, sir.

10:57.454 --> 10:59.222
Rush was asking
for a free pass,

10:59.223 --> 11:01.290
An unscheduled,
unauthorized visit to Earth,

11:01.291 --> 11:02.725
Exactly the sort of thing
he might do

11:02.726 --> 11:03.960
If he was the mole himself.

11:03.961 --> 11:05.895
Well, if he's the mole,
why would he be trying

11:05.896 --> 11:07.830
To frame Telford at this point?

11:07.831 --> 11:09.499
I can't answer that, sir.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.167
And if he's telling the truth?

11:11.168 --> 11:13.369
Hopefully he'll still be able
to lead us to the alliance.

11:13.370 --> 11:15.204
And not lose his life.

11:15.205 --> 11:17.573
Yes, sir.

11:17.574 --> 11:19.976
I've quite a few
personal things to attend to.

11:19.977 --> 11:21.878
I'll be a few minutes.

11:21.879 --> 11:24.580
Not to worry, sir.
I came prepared.

13:21.765 --> 13:24.300
So, do you know what
they're going to do to Rush?

13:24.301 --> 13:26.869
They didn't let me know
until after the fact.

13:28.772 --> 13:30.940
They're trying to
keep me out of the loop.

13:30.941 --> 13:33.376
It's not...

13:35.579 --> 13:36.712
Where the hell
have you been?

13:36.713 --> 13:38.481
It's nice to see you too.

13:38.482 --> 13:39.549
Come with me.

13:39.550 --> 13:40.950
We have some things to discuss.

13:40.951 --> 13:42.685
Do we?

13:42.686 --> 13:44.554
Privately.

13:59.503 --> 14:01.571
We haven't seen you
in a while, Colonel.

14:01.572 --> 14:03.339
I hope everything
is well.

14:03.340 --> 14:04.707
I've been on assignment.

14:04.708 --> 14:06.542
Of course.

14:08.879 --> 14:12.648
I'll give you some privacy.

14:39.543 --> 14:40.610
Yes?

14:40.611 --> 14:42.778
Yeah, this is Telford.

14:42.779 --> 14:43.946
I have some new information.

14:43.947 --> 14:45.081
We have to meet.

14:49.519 --> 14:51.554
Stand by
for instructions.

15:03.066 --> 15:05.501
Get in.

15:18.649 --> 15:20.049
You're allowing
alcohol onboard now?

15:20.050 --> 15:21.751
I doubt I could stop it
if I wanted to.

15:21.752 --> 15:23.853
So I can report your
command of this ship

15:23.854 --> 15:25.054
Is solid as ever,
then?

15:25.055 --> 15:28.658
I am doing my best
to make it work.

15:33.664 --> 15:35.665
Why did I connect with Rush?

15:35.666 --> 15:36.766
Oh, we'll get to that.

15:36.767 --> 15:39.535
I think we need to
clr the air a little bit.

15:41.738 --> 15:42.905
Have another.

15:42.906 --> 15:43.973
I'm on duty.

15:43.974 --> 15:45.474
You're on duty.

15:45.475 --> 15:46.676
Yes, and we're both
a billion light years

15:46.677 --> 15:48.711
Away from the nearest
disciplinary hearing.

15:48.712 --> 15:53.482
So, what, you afraid of
what you might say?

15:53.483 --> 15:55.184
I don't have
anything to hide,

15:55.185 --> 15:56.419
From you
or anyone else.

15:56.420 --> 15:57.586
Is that so?

15:57.587 --> 16:00.523
I could've brought
you up on charges

16:00.524 --> 16:02.058
For assaulting
a fellow officer.

16:02.059 --> 16:03.092
You should just thank me
and let it go.

16:03.093 --> 16:04.427
Well, I think
we both know

16:04.428 --> 16:05.561
That you don't want
the details

16:05.562 --> 16:06.762
Of that little incident
getting out

16:06.763 --> 16:08.297
Any more than I do.

16:08.298 --> 16:09.432
You cheated on your wife,
and she moved on.

16:09.433 --> 16:10.666
End of story.

16:10.667 --> 16:12.501
You took advantage

16:12.502 --> 16:14.804
To get back at me
on a personal level.

16:18.108 --> 16:20.943
You were sleeping with an
officer under your command!

16:20.944 --> 16:22.611
I mean, look
at you, Everett.

16:22.612 --> 16:24.613
You're a disgrace.

16:24.614 --> 16:25.881
But I'm here,

16:25.882 --> 16:27.750
Right?

16:27.751 --> 16:29.452
And that's...
That's what's killing you,

16:29.453 --> 16:31.954
isn't it?

16:31.955 --> 16:33.756
Because this was
supposed to be your prize.

16:33.757 --> 16:35.958
Your reward
for all that hard work.

16:35.959 --> 16:38.160
An entire year living
with those criminals,

16:38.161 --> 16:40.663
thieves, murderers,

16:40.664 --> 16:41.931
pretending to be
one of them,

16:41.932 --> 16:45.534
I mean, that's got
to take its toll.

16:45.535 --> 16:46.669
I'm not doing this again.

16:46.670 --> 16:47.970
The man I used to know

16:47.971 --> 16:50.139
would not let
37 people die

16:50.140 --> 16:52.108
To cover his own ass.

16:52.109 --> 16:53.709
So, what changed?

16:55.846 --> 17:00.750
What happened
to you, David?

17:02.652 --> 17:03.886
Thanks for the drink.

17:06.890 --> 17:09.925
Scott...

17:21.671 --> 17:23.005
What are we doing?

17:23.006 --> 17:25.273
We're waiting,
what else?

17:43.226 --> 17:46.762
Daniel, come in.
Do you read?

17:46.763 --> 17:48.497
Jack, what is it?

17:48.498 --> 17:50.900
Carter says they're using
some kind of jamming device.

17:50.901 --> 17:53.602
We can't get a lock on
anyone in the area.

17:53.603 --> 17:54.837
What's your status?

17:54.838 --> 17:56.172
They've stopped.

17:56.173 --> 17:57.773
Looks like we're
waiting on someone.

17:57.774 --> 17:59.141
Well, ground assault
is standing by.

17:59.142 --> 18:01.076
They'll move when you call it.

18:04.147 --> 18:05.281
Hang on.

18:20.130 --> 18:21.964
Who are you?

18:21.965 --> 18:24.834
I'm sorry,
I don't know what you mean.

18:24.835 --> 18:26.268
All right, who am I?

18:28.205 --> 18:29.605
Whoever you are,

18:29.606 --> 18:31.207
You must be using the ancient
communication stones.

18:31.208 --> 18:33.008
I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:33.009 --> 18:34.043
You failed to use
the proper code

18:34.044 --> 18:35.411
When you called in.

18:35.412 --> 18:37.112
Colonel Telford would never
make such a mistake.

18:42.319 --> 18:43.652
His cover's blown.

18:43.653 --> 18:45.020
Move in. Move in now.

18:45.021 --> 18:46.655
They have a ship.

19:04.808 --> 19:07.843
Go! Go!

19:11.815 --> 19:14.617
We're too late.

19:23.139 --> 19:24.473
You okay?

19:27.210 --> 19:28.944
Yeah...

19:30.146 --> 19:33.015
I'm fine.

19:35.051 --> 19:36.853
What chance
does this baby have

19:36.854 --> 19:39.489
of ever living a normal life?

19:42.392 --> 19:44.326
What's normal anyway?

19:46.930 --> 19:52.000
I don't know,
but I don't think it's this.

19:55.839 --> 20:01.276
Look, I know right now
it seems impossible

20:01.277 --> 20:03.312
that we will ever
make it back.

20:03.313 --> 20:06.448
But I also know that
since we've been here,

20:06.449 --> 20:07.816
it seems like we're averaging

20:07.817 --> 20:10.419
about five impossible
things a week, right?

20:12.122 --> 20:16.058
So why assume
the worst?

20:16.059 --> 20:17.326
Look, at the very least,

20:17.327 --> 20:18.961
there are a lot
of people here

20:18.962 --> 20:22.965
who are going to care
about that baby.

20:22.966 --> 20:26.835
That's something.

20:26.836 --> 20:29.338
Yeah.

20:29.339 --> 20:32.041
We are all going to help you.

20:32.042 --> 20:35.210
Thanks, Chloe.

20:35.211 --> 20:37.346
Come here.

20:41.718 --> 20:43.485
According to our intelligence,
her name is kiva.

20:43.486 --> 20:45.120
She's the daughter
of a Lucian alliance warlord

20:45.121 --> 20:46.221
Named massin,

20:46.222 --> 20:47.289
One of the higher-ups.

20:47.290 --> 20:49.458
Powerful and brutal.

20:49.459 --> 20:50.893
That intel
come from Telford?

20:50.894 --> 20:52.428
Yeah, well, at least we know
who the mole is, eh?

20:52.429 --> 20:53.729
There's an easy way
to end this.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.464
We cut the connection
on the stones.

20:55.465 --> 20:57.232
They get Telford back,
we're no closer

20:57.233 --> 20:58.934
To figuring out
what they're up to.

20:58.935 --> 21:00.169
Dr. Rush's life
is in danger.

21:00.170 --> 21:01.437
He volunteered.
He knew the risks.

21:03.006 --> 21:04.973
That cargo ship
slipped past all of our sensors.

21:04.974 --> 21:06.041
We have no ia
where it's going.

21:06.042 --> 21:07.176
Telford might,

21:07.177 --> 21:08.577
And he may know more.

21:08.578 --> 21:10.345
I'm just asking for the chance
to get it out of him.

21:12.148 --> 21:14.116
He still has rights,
doesn't he?

21:14.117 --> 21:16.618
He didn't say
how he was going to do it.

21:16.619 --> 21:17.853
With all due
respect, sir,

21:17.854 --> 21:19.354
You and I both know
the people who made the rules

21:19.355 --> 21:21.390
Were not prepared
for anything like this.

21:44.748 --> 21:45.914
I'm sorry.

21:45.915 --> 21:50.018
I know
that really hurts.

21:50.019 --> 21:51.787
Well, I suppose
it was worth it.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.922
I had to make it look good.

21:56.025 --> 21:58.260
Of course

21:58.261 --> 21:59.261
I didn't give them the code
on purpose.

21:59.262 --> 22:00.362
I'm not a complete idiot.

22:00.363 --> 22:01.430
On purpose?

22:01.431 --> 22:03.198
What are you talking about?

22:03.199 --> 22:05.934
They were getting suspicious.

22:05.935 --> 22:08.370
Yes, I was beginning to have
concerns about that myself.

22:08.371 --> 22:10.038
Well, that's why
I had to come in.

22:10.039 --> 22:13.008
I wasn't sure
whether I was being followed.

22:13.009 --> 22:17.079
I figured if they thought
I was being taken by force,

22:17.080 --> 22:19.815
It might help us
salvage something

22:19.816 --> 22:21.049
From this operation.

22:22.452 --> 22:24.052
Nice try.

22:25.555 --> 22:29.224
You almost managed to make that
sound convincing.

22:29.225 --> 22:31.827
Well, it sounds convincing
because it's true.

22:31.828 --> 22:34.429
If you really are
Colonel Telford,

22:34.430 --> 22:37.032
You'll know my name.

22:42.338 --> 22:45.107
It's kiva.

22:45.108 --> 22:46.875
Good.

22:46.876 --> 22:48.844
Next question.

22:48.845 --> 22:51.180
What's yours?

22:54.250 --> 22:56.385
A spy?

22:56.386 --> 22:58.453
A Lucian alliance spy?

23:00.190 --> 23:02.024
You are so desperate
to get back at me

23:02.025 --> 23:03.826
That you would say or do
anything, wouldn't you?

23:03.827 --> 23:05.260
We have proof.

23:05.261 --> 23:07.529
Oh, come on, Everett, this
is all about me and Emily.

23:07.530 --> 23:09.498
Well, how do you think
I found out about that?

23:11.201 --> 23:14.236
You switched bodies with Scott,
do you remember that?

23:14.237 --> 23:15.437
Yeah.

23:15.438 --> 23:17.339
He's the one
who told me.

23:17.340 --> 23:19.107
He saw it, in his mind,

23:19.108 --> 23:20.509
A vision.

23:20.510 --> 23:22.110
Call it residual memory,
whatever you want.

23:22.111 --> 23:24.179
It seems that every time
you use the stones,

23:24.180 --> 23:27.316
You leave
a little something behind.

23:28.451 --> 23:31.186
Maybe...
Maybe that's guilt.

23:31.187 --> 23:33.455
Maybe,
deep down inside,

23:33.456 --> 23:35.357
You want the truth to come out.

23:40.997 --> 23:42.531
You're insane.

23:42.532 --> 23:43.498
Well, you've
already confessed.

23:43.499 --> 23:47.169
You just won't admit it.

23:53.610 --> 23:55.611
We'll let him sweat a while.

23:55.612 --> 23:56.912
Give me a shot, sir.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.513
Won't take long.

23:58.514 --> 24:00.215
Appreciate the
enthusiasm, sergeant.

24:00.216 --> 24:01.917
Not yet.

24:15.064 --> 24:17.366
I would really prefer
not to have to do this.

24:20.036 --> 24:22.237
I wish I had time
to convince you

24:22.238 --> 24:24.339
That I'm not
what you think I am.

24:24.340 --> 24:25.574
Oh, yeah,
and what's that?

24:25.575 --> 24:27.676
I'm a reasonable person

24:27.677 --> 24:30.012
just trying to do what's
right for my people.

24:30.013 --> 24:33.015
You make a terrible
first impression.

24:33.016 --> 24:35.651
We have brainwashing
technologies.

24:35.652 --> 24:37.219
I could try those,

24:37.220 --> 24:38.287
but I'm not sure
what they'd do to you

24:38.288 --> 24:40.188
under the circumstances,

24:40.189 --> 24:43.191
with your consciousness
in somebody else's body.

24:43.192 --> 24:45.694
Unfortunately, I've learned
one thing about torture

24:45.695 --> 24:47.562
over the years.

24:47.563 --> 24:49.398
It's... Effective.

24:51.567 --> 24:53.502
Barbaric, I know,

24:53.503 --> 24:56.338
and I hate lowering
myself to this level,

24:56.339 --> 24:59.274
but I need to
know who you are,

24:59.275 --> 25:03.278
and beyond that, whether or
not you're any use to me.

25:21.252 --> 25:22.919
Has he been ven
any food or water?

25:23.420 --> 25:24.554
Open it.

25:24.555 --> 25:26.523
Sir, maybe I should
go in there with you...

25:26.524 --> 25:28.091
No, no, that will not
be necessary, Lieutenant.

25:28.092 --> 25:29.626
This is on me, only me.

25:29.627 --> 25:31.561
Open it.

25:40.671 --> 25:42.939
You can't keep me
in here forever.

25:42.940 --> 25:44.674
No one's pulling the
plug on the stones, so...

25:44.675 --> 25:46.043
Why don't you just
admit what you did,

25:46.044 --> 25:47.177
and we can move on?

25:47.178 --> 25:48.412
I want to talk to Scott.

25:48.413 --> 25:50.180
I have a right
to face my accuser.

25:50.181 --> 25:51.982
This didn't come
from Scott.

25:51.983 --> 25:53.316
You switched with Rush,

25:53.317 --> 25:54.518
remember?

25:54.519 --> 25:55.685
Rush?

25:55.686 --> 25:57.687
This is coming from Rush?

25:57.688 --> 25:59.556
At first,
I didn't believe him either.

25:59.557 --> 26:00.690
I figured

26:00.691 --> 26:02.092
I'd give enough rope
to hang himself,

26:02.093 --> 26:03.260
But guess what?

26:03.261 --> 26:05.162
That didn't happen.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.303
What's that?

26:13.304 --> 26:14.337
Airman dunning
brought it along

26:14.338 --> 26:15.939
With his personal
effects.

26:15.940 --> 26:17.274
Do you recognize them?

26:17.275 --> 26:19.042
They were all
stationed on Icarus.

26:19.043 --> 26:20.577
The fire suppression team.

26:20.578 --> 26:22.245
They got trapped
during the attack

26:22.246 --> 26:24.114
When a corridor collapsed.

26:24.115 --> 26:26.149
They all burned alive,
every last one of them.

26:26.150 --> 26:29.186
No, no, no, no...

26:29.187 --> 26:31.321
You take a good look.

26:31.322 --> 26:32.422
Take a look.

26:32.423 --> 26:33.857
I want you to look
at their faces,

26:33.858 --> 26:35.258
Because you killed them.

26:35.259 --> 26:37.194
You killed them as if
you'd doused them with gasoline

26:37.195 --> 26:38.462
And lit the match yourself,

26:38.463 --> 26:39.629
And they weren't
the only ones.

26:39.630 --> 26:42.666
So we know that
you are a traitor

26:42.667 --> 26:44.000
And a murderer.

26:44.001 --> 26:46.636
Now we know
you're a coward, too.

26:57.648 --> 26:59.449
All right,
that's enough!

26:59.450 --> 27:00.650
Stand down,
sergeant!

27:00.651 --> 27:03.120
I said stand down!

27:03.121 --> 27:05.422
Get out,
both of you!

27:05.423 --> 27:06.256
Sir...

27:06.257 --> 27:08.225
Get out!

27:22.440 --> 27:23.473
Okay.

27:23.474 --> 27:26.710
So...

27:26.711 --> 27:28.645
Where were we?

27:36.120 --> 27:37.554
This will eventually kill you.

27:37.555 --> 27:40.123
You'll be killing Telford too.

27:40.124 --> 27:41.258
That might just
work out for the best

27:41.259 --> 27:43.126
Given that
he's been compromised.

27:43.127 --> 27:44.594
I have a full rundown

27:44.595 --> 27:46.763
Of the personnel aboard Destiny,

27:46.764 --> 27:48.532
And I doubt very much
that civilians

27:48.533 --> 27:50.133
Or the scientists
would have endured this,

27:50.134 --> 27:51.334
So the question is

27:51.335 --> 27:53.603
Whether or not Colonel Young

27:53.604 --> 27:56.072
Would have put himself
in this situation, or...

27:56.073 --> 27:59.075
Send his first Lieutenant,
Scott?

27:59.076 --> 28:01.311
How do you know
I'm someone aboard Destiny?

28:01.312 --> 28:03.380
That's a fair question.

28:08.486 --> 28:10.387
You can make this stop.

28:13.357 --> 28:15.492
If I answer your question,

28:15.493 --> 28:18.028
You're going to kill me.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.362
Either way I'm dead.

28:19.363 --> 28:20.430
I won't.

28:20.431 --> 28:22.732
You have my word.

28:22.733 --> 28:26.736
You have
nothing to lose.

28:31.142 --> 28:32.509
Rush!

28:34.212 --> 28:36.513
I'm Dr. Nicholas Rush.

28:44.622 --> 28:45.789
I want this connection cut.

28:45.790 --> 28:47.224
I want to go back
to my own body.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.358
No, you don't.

28:48.359 --> 28:49.459
You're damaged goods.

28:49.460 --> 28:50.594
You go back now, your
friends at the alliance

28:50.595 --> 28:52.028
Aren't going to be
too happy with you.

28:52.029 --> 28:53.630
I don't have any friends
in the alliance.

28:53.631 --> 28:55.332
Not anymore
you don't.

28:55.333 --> 28:56.766
Your only hope
is with us.

28:56.767 --> 28:58.034
You come clean now,

28:58.035 --> 28:59.669
I will do my best
to help you.

28:59.670 --> 29:00.670
I am not a spy, Everett!

29:00.671 --> 29:02.439
How manyimes
do I have to tell you?

29:10.448 --> 29:12.115
Recognize it?

29:16.687 --> 29:18.655
Should I?

29:18.656 --> 29:21.057
It's your work.

29:21.058 --> 29:23.760
To do with dialing
the ninth chevron

29:23.761 --> 29:25.729
That leads to Destiny.

29:29.233 --> 29:30.467
These readings...

29:30.468 --> 29:32.369
Similar naquadria deposits.

29:32.370 --> 29:34.838
We had some issues
adapting the equations,

29:34.839 --> 29:37.107
But there should be
enough power to get us there.

29:40.144 --> 29:43.113
You've found
another Icarus planet.

29:44.815 --> 29:46.716
Let's talk about the outpost.

29:46.717 --> 29:49.486
P2s 569.

29:49.487 --> 29:50.553
We've been
through this.

29:50.554 --> 29:52.355
I was cleared
of any wrongdoing.

29:52.356 --> 29:53.690
Because they didn't
have all the facts.

29:55.393 --> 29:56.493
I couldn't blow my cover.

29:56.494 --> 29:58.828
I didn't have a choice!

30:00.264 --> 30:03.700
Remember that little
combat engineer, Sanchez?

30:03.701 --> 30:04.868
Remember her? She used
to follow you around

30:04.869 --> 30:06.102
like a puppy.

30:06.103 --> 30:08.838
She was hit
in the first blast.

30:08.839 --> 30:11.441
Right arm severed
at the shoulder.

30:11.442 --> 30:14.244
She's screaming, yelling,
begging me to help her.

30:14.245 --> 30:15.578
All I could do

30:15.579 --> 30:17.814
Was watch her bleed
to death in the dirt.

30:17.815 --> 30:19.516
It wasn't my fault.

30:19.517 --> 30:21.751
Now, we already know
you did it,

30:21.752 --> 30:25.855
But it's possible
you're not responsible.

30:25.856 --> 30:28.124
W- what are you talking about?

30:28.125 --> 30:29.292
Think about it.

30:29.293 --> 30:30.660
I want you
to think about it.

30:30.661 --> 30:32.128
Why is it that
the memory transfer

30:32.129 --> 30:33.363
Happens only with you

30:33.364 --> 30:34.531
And only you
and no one else

30:34.532 --> 30:35.832
When they use the stones?

30:35.833 --> 30:37.867
They messed with
your head, David.

30:37.868 --> 30:39.302
They made you think
that you were one of them,

30:39.303 --> 30:40.470
and you're not.

30:40.471 --> 30:43.139
That's not you.

30:43.140 --> 30:44.741
Now, we can help you,
we can bring you back,

30:44.742 --> 30:47.644
but I need you to
take the first step.

30:47.645 --> 30:49.746
You tell us

30:49.747 --> 30:51.481
where they're taking Rush.

30:54.485 --> 30:56.319
David?

30:56.320 --> 30:58.254
Tell me.

31:11.469 --> 31:14.604
We've replicated it
as best we could.

31:14.605 --> 31:17.874
Olan!

31:17.875 --> 31:20.310
Meet Dr. Rush.

31:21.512 --> 31:22.812
Doctor.

31:22.813 --> 31:25.515
Olan is one of
our lead scientists

31:25.516 --> 31:26.916
Your work
is impressive.

31:26.917 --> 31:29.285
It was nothing, really.

31:29.286 --> 31:31.221
When I found out that
you were on your way...

31:31.222 --> 31:32.722
Yes, we're all
very excited

31:32.723 --> 31:34.190
To have Dr. Rush's
full cooperation.

31:34.191 --> 31:38.194
Maybe now we'll actually
make a connection.

31:44.335 --> 31:45.468
As you can see,

31:45.469 --> 31:48.638
We've procured
some familiar technology.

31:48.639 --> 31:51.307
It was necessary
to implement your methods.

31:51.308 --> 31:53.343
I trust
it will suffice?

31:53.344 --> 31:55.211
I'll leave you to your work.

31:58.482 --> 32:00.750
The figures for these
naquadria deposits

32:00.751 --> 32:01.985
are correct, yes?

32:01.986 --> 32:03.353
Of course.

32:03.354 --> 32:04.821
Because if they're out
by even a fraction...

32:04.822 --> 32:06.122
We spent months

32:06.123 --> 32:07.323
doing a detailed
orbital survey.

32:07.324 --> 32:09.392
We mapped every deposit
down to the last vein.

32:12.430 --> 32:15.532
All right, then, I'm done.

32:15.533 --> 32:17.367
Really?

32:17.368 --> 32:19.803
It's not that difficult
when you know what you're doing.

32:19.804 --> 32:20.804
But...

32:20.805 --> 32:22.238
I'm kidding.

32:22.239 --> 32:24.441
This is probably
going to take some time.

32:24.442 --> 32:27.510
Oh... Of course.

32:28.011 --> 32:30.479
Quite possibly the
rest of my life...

32:41.258 --> 32:43.460
Lieutenant, there's a lot
of talk around the ship

32:43.461 --> 32:44.661
About what's going on
in that room.

32:44.662 --> 32:47.297
This is a military
matter, ma'am.

32:47.298 --> 32:48.598
It doesn't
concern you.

32:48.599 --> 32:50.467
That's exactly the kind of talk

32:50.468 --> 32:52.368
That forced us to try
and take control of this ship

32:52.369 --> 32:54.771
Once before, sergeant.

33:00.978 --> 33:02.645
Camile...

33:02.646 --> 33:04.280
Do you want the
rumors to spread,

33:04.281 --> 33:05.782
or do you want to do
something about it?

33:05.783 --> 33:08.284
It'll be over soon enough,
that is all you need to know.

33:08.285 --> 33:09.953
See, that's the wrong answer.

33:09.954 --> 33:13.790
Come on, Lieutenant,
something tells me

33:13.791 --> 33:15.825
That you do not want this
on your conscience.

33:15.826 --> 33:17.694
Better be careful.

33:17.695 --> 33:20.964
Whatever it is,
we all have to live with it.

33:28.839 --> 33:30.640
I need to communicate
with stargate command.

33:30.641 --> 33:32.008
Do we let him out...

33:32.009 --> 33:33.977
Nobody in or out.
That is an order.

33:33.978 --> 33:36.045
I want to talk to him.

33:36.046 --> 33:38.047
Colonel!

33:46.490 --> 33:48.057
Progress?

33:48.058 --> 33:48.958
None yet.

33:48.959 --> 33:50.627
You must be joking.

33:50.628 --> 33:51.761
You're stalling.

33:51.762 --> 33:52.762
Well, if you want to
blow yourselves up,

33:52.763 --> 33:54.430
you go right ahead.

33:54.431 --> 33:55.832
You along with us.

33:55.833 --> 33:56.933
This is going
to take time,

33:56.934 --> 33:58.468
and I don't just
mean a few hours.

33:58.469 --> 34:00.837
But Olan said we've been
close for months now.

34:00.838 --> 34:02.005
I assumed that
with your help,

34:02.006 --> 34:03.473
we'd be able to...

34:03.474 --> 34:05.341
Look, with all due
respect to Olan here,

34:05.342 --> 34:07.510
his work is shoddy at best.

34:07.511 --> 34:09.879
I'm sorry, you're just
going to have to trust me

34:09.880 --> 34:11.047
on this one.

34:11.047 --> 34:12.482
The whole thing's
a bloody mess.

34:12.483 --> 34:14.417
I may have to start
from scratch.

34:32.103 --> 34:33.971
You call yourself reasonable?

34:33.972 --> 34:36.938
I am. You said he
was incompetent.

34:37.940 --> 34:39.809
I was stalling.

34:39.810 --> 34:41.077
You were right.

34:41.078 --> 34:42.511
I shouldn't
have to demonstrate

34:42.512 --> 34:44.981
how important
this is to me,

34:44.982 --> 34:47.382
to all of us, Dr. Rush.

34:48.952 --> 34:51.219
No more chances.

34:55.030 --> 34:56.263
Now what's happening?

34:57.466 --> 34:59.000
We're not sure.

34:59.001 --> 35:02.003
Young's been back and forth
on the stones all day.

35:02.004 --> 35:03.738
Looks like this time

35:03.739 --> 35:06.107
he brought someone
back with him.

35:06.108 --> 35:08.776
Who is it?

35:08.777 --> 35:13.881
Welcome to the
Destiny, General.

35:17.386 --> 35:18.452
Hello.

35:18.453 --> 35:20.287
Sir.

35:21.423 --> 35:23.324
Corporal?

35:23.325 --> 35:24.792
Sorry about that, sir.

35:24.793 --> 35:26.494
This way.

35:32.200 --> 35:34.001
Sir.

35:48.350 --> 35:49.884
Who's this?

35:51.286 --> 35:53.187
General O'Neill.

35:54.890 --> 35:57.291
It's really him.

36:00.762 --> 36:01.762
Okay.

36:01.763 --> 36:04.432
Let's say it's true.

36:04.433 --> 36:05.966
General, I'm being held
without charge.

36:05.967 --> 36:07.535
I've been denied counsel,
and one of his men attacked me.

36:07.536 --> 36:08.969
David, he knows.

36:08.970 --> 36:10.438
He authorized it.

36:11.907 --> 36:16.077
Well, maybe not
that last part there.

36:16.078 --> 36:17.945
This is what I've been
trying to tell you.

36:20.215 --> 36:22.516
Time to come clean, son.

36:25.320 --> 36:28.823
We need to know where
they've taken Rush.

36:28.824 --> 36:31.292
You checked out
that gate address I gave you?

36:31.293 --> 36:32.860
Oh, yeah.
Dead end.

36:37.933 --> 36:41.535
You didn't think I'd give you
anything real, did you?

36:43.572 --> 36:45.272
You should see
your face.

36:45.273 --> 36:48.075
You look so surprised.

36:48.076 --> 36:50.077
Actually,
I'm disappointed.

36:50.078 --> 36:51.312
You may not believe this,

36:51.313 --> 36:52.379
but I was actually
holding out hope

36:52.380 --> 36:53.447
that it might not be true,

36:53.448 --> 36:55.950
that there was some
other explanation.

36:55.951 --> 36:57.151
It doesn't matter.

36:57.152 --> 36:59.386
You can't stop it.

36:59.387 --> 37:00.387
Stop...

37:00.388 --> 37:02.089
What?

37:10.999 --> 37:12.166
Here you go.

37:20.976 --> 37:23.410
I wouldn't say it was good.

37:26.982 --> 37:28.149
What's it like?

37:29.384 --> 37:30.584
I mean, we've heard
descriptions,

37:30.585 --> 37:32.386
But what's it like being there?

37:32.387 --> 37:33.621
On Destiny?

37:33.622 --> 37:36.123
You've flown around
in space ships before.

37:36.124 --> 37:37.258
Not an ancient ship.

37:37.259 --> 37:40.861
Not that far out into
the unknown universe.

37:40.862 --> 37:44.265
Well, it's a rust bucket,
what can I tell you?

37:44.266 --> 37:46.534
I can't wait
to see it for myself.

37:50.071 --> 37:52.606
What if I can't do it?

37:52.607 --> 37:56.577
What if we just fail
to make a connection?

37:56.578 --> 37:57.945
Kiva promised
she wouldn't kill you.

37:57.946 --> 37:59.146
Her word is good.

38:02.017 --> 38:05.186
I'll have to kill you myself.

38:16.331 --> 38:17.598
You think I was brainwashed?

38:17.599 --> 38:21.569
I came to my senses.

38:21.570 --> 38:23.170
We freed billions of people

38:23.171 --> 38:24.538
from thousands of
years of slavery

38:24.539 --> 38:26.340
all over our galaxy,

38:26.341 --> 38:28.142
and then we patted
ourselves on the back

38:28.143 --> 38:30.077
and left them with little
or no means for survival.

38:30.078 --> 38:32.246
What the hell did we think
was going to happen?

38:32.247 --> 38:33.314
This isn't you, David.

38:33.315 --> 38:34.615
Wake up, Everett!

38:36.251 --> 38:38.485
You think the Lucian alliance
are just a bunch of criminals?

38:38.486 --> 38:41.055
Who made us
judge and jury?

38:41.056 --> 38:45.025
People will do
whathey have to do to survive.

38:45.026 --> 38:48.062
You should know that
by now.

38:49.397 --> 38:51.932
We take whatever we want.

38:51.933 --> 38:54.101
We do whatever is good for us

38:54.102 --> 38:56.403
regardless of the impact
on other planets!

38:56.404 --> 38:58.906
What makes us so special?

38:58.907 --> 39:02.309
I know what
makes me special.

39:07.682 --> 39:09.250
This is not our ship.

39:09.251 --> 39:12.219
It wasn't intended for us.

39:12.220 --> 39:14.455
Where are they taking Rush?

39:14.456 --> 39:16.590
It was supposed to be
for the benefit of all mankind.

39:18.059 --> 39:21.028
He's more far gone
than I thought, General.

39:21.029 --> 39:22.429
Yeah, I've heard enough.

39:23.665 --> 39:25.199
Probably take it
to the next level, sir.

39:26.268 --> 39:30.604
Go ahead and do
what you need to do.

39:30.605 --> 39:33.374
Communications room,
this is Young.

39:33.375 --> 39:35.109
Please cut
the General's connection.

39:35.110 --> 39:37.077
Yes, sir.

39:43.084 --> 39:44.485
Sir.

39:44.486 --> 39:48.022
Dismissed, Corporal.

39:57.565 --> 40:00.301
Okay, this has gone
on long enough.

40:00.302 --> 40:01.368
You have to cut
the connection.

40:01.369 --> 40:02.403
I can't do that.

40:02.404 --> 40:04.738
Dr. Rush's life is in danger.

40:04.739 --> 40:06.340
That's more important
than getting any intel

40:06.341 --> 40:08.108
on the Lucian alliance!

40:09.311 --> 40:11.578
I just thought maybe
we'd be better off

40:11.579 --> 40:13.113
if she knew, sir.

40:14.349 --> 40:15.382
Control room, this is Young.

40:15.383 --> 40:17.751
This is Brody.

40:17.752 --> 40:20.020
Bring up the life support
controls for this section.

40:24.693 --> 40:26.360
I got it.

40:26.361 --> 40:27.561
Begin venting
the atmosphere

40:27.562 --> 40:28.962
in Colonel Telford's
quarters now.

40:28.963 --> 40:29.963
What?

40:34.402 --> 40:36.970
Say again?

40:36.971 --> 40:38.706
Begin venting Colonel
Telford's quarters now.

40:38.707 --> 40:39.707
What the hell
are you doing?

40:39.708 --> 40:42.109
Camile, stay out of this.

40:42.110 --> 40:43.977
He can't do this!

40:43.978 --> 40:45.045
Lieutenant!

40:46.581 --> 40:48.248
David!

40:48.249 --> 40:49.983
David, can you hear me?

40:51.519 --> 40:53.721
It's got to be
a bluff.

40:53.722 --> 40:55.556
To scare him.

41:01.196 --> 41:02.262
Look, you can't...

41:12.707 --> 41:15.275
David, I'm venting the
atmosphere in your room!

41:15.276 --> 41:20.180
You've got five minutes
before you die of suffocation.

41:26.087 --> 41:27.554
Your only hope

41:27.555 --> 41:31.024
is to tell me the location
of the alliance base.

41:31.025 --> 41:32.292
You're bluffing!

41:32.293 --> 41:33.360
Kill me, and you kill Rush!

41:33.361 --> 41:34.728
I know,

41:34.729 --> 41:37.731
but right now, I'm thinking
of the greater good.

41:39.033 --> 41:40.100
So...

41:40.101 --> 41:42.202
What's it going to be?

42:02.756 --> 42:04.658
Young!

42:04.659 --> 42:05.826
Open this damn door!

42:09.965 --> 42:11.832
We both know you're
not going to kill me.
