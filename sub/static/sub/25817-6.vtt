00:17.309 --> 00:19.394
<i>For years, losing my virginity</i>

00:19.478 --> 00:21.396
<i>felt just as impossible
as losing the weight.</i>

00:21.480 --> 00:23.440
<i>So I hadn't given it much thought.</i>

00:23.982 --> 00:24.983
<i>But now...</i>

00:25.692 --> 00:28.987
<i>I wanted to take out my new body
and see what it could do.</i>

00:31.990 --> 00:35.035
<i>I still wasn't totally comfortable
in my new skin.</i>

00:35.118 --> 00:38.455
<i>But feeling Brick's skin against mine
was driving me crazy.</i>

00:38.539 --> 00:42.084
<i>I was making out with the guy
I'd been crushing on since junior high.</i>

00:42.167 --> 00:44.795
<i>It was my schoolgirl fantasy come true.</i>

00:46.296 --> 00:48.048
<i>I didn't care if it was love.</i>

00:48.507 --> 00:51.385
<i>For the first time in my life,
I was hungry</i>

00:51.468 --> 00:52.970
<i>for something other than food.</i>

00:53.345 --> 00:55.347
<i>And I wanted more.</i>

00:55.430 --> 00:58.141
Wow, wow. Hey, slow down.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.602
Why? Am I doing something wrong?

01:00.686 --> 01:02.187
No. I just...

01:02.604 --> 01:06.692
I really like you and Magnolia
always said I was going too fast, so.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.193
I'm not Magnolia.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.196
Unless you're not sure?

01:11.863 --> 01:13.323
Are you not attracted to me?

01:13.407 --> 01:16.618
No, no, no. No. I am.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.370
I definitely am.

01:18.745 --> 01:19.621
I...

01:20.497 --> 01:21.456
I just...

01:21.748 --> 01:23.500
I still think it should be special.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.836
Let me do something nice for you.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.462
I know what you can do for me.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.758
Oh my God.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.512
Magnolia's freaking
that you're not returning her texts.

01:35.846 --> 01:38.557
She's asking me if I think
you're hooking up with someone else.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.725
You guys are friends?

01:39.808 --> 01:42.519
We won't be for long
if she finds out about us.

01:43.020 --> 01:46.940
God, it's so unfair.
Magnolia gets everything she wants.

01:47.024 --> 01:49.484
Pageant crowns and friends and you.

01:49.568 --> 01:52.821
Now that's finally my turn, she gets
to make me feel guilty about it.

01:52.904 --> 01:53.739
Hey.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.449
I won't tell her if you don't.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.161
Could you also not tell your dad?

02:00.120 --> 02:03.165
He'll just get worried that you're gonna
distract me from Miss Magic Jesus.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.209
Trust me, the last thing I want
is for him to get involved.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.466
Why won't Magnolia...

02:12.549 --> 02:13.925
Oh, it's your dad.

02:14.843 --> 02:15.677
Crap!

02:16.845 --> 02:18.930
I gotta go get my baptism certificate.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.809
- Could you give me a ride?
- Mm-hm.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.275
You were never baptized?

02:30.359 --> 02:33.111
Patty, I asked you about this weeks ago!

02:35.697 --> 02:37.866
I assumed that I was.

02:37.949 --> 02:40.535
I know we don't go to church,
but we're in the Bible Belt.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.788
Everyone I know has been baptized,
even Jews.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.039
Why would I be the exception?

02:44.581 --> 02:47.084
I kept meaning to do it.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.504
I was kinda busy after you were born,
making up six...

02:50.587 --> 02:52.005
nine months of not drinking.

02:53.298 --> 02:57.010
Besides, you don't really
believe in all that stuff, do you?

02:57.552 --> 02:59.596
What, God? A higher power?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.765
The thing that you said got you sober

03:01.848 --> 03:03.767
and kept you from ending up dead
in a ditch?

03:03.850 --> 03:06.478
You're right.
Why would I believe in any of that?

03:06.561 --> 03:10.232
I figured maybe you would protect
my immortal soul from eternal damnation.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.817
You know, just in case hell is real.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.277
Oh, it is real. All right?

03:14.361 --> 03:18.198
Without that baptism certificate,
you are in pageant purgatory.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.742
No Miss Magic Jesus,
no Miss American Lady.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.870
I have to talk to Pastor Mike
before orientation.

03:23.954 --> 03:24.788
Pastor who?

03:24.871 --> 03:26.873
He just took over
the Fourth Baptist Church.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.376
He is in charge of the pageant.

03:29.459 --> 03:33.255
Maybe he'll make an exception,
show us some of the Lord's mercy.

03:33.338 --> 03:36.466
No way, Jose. Look.

03:37.634 --> 03:41.430
I may be new to the whole pageant thing,
but it's just common sense.

03:41.513 --> 03:45.517
Patty can't be in a pageant called
Miss Magic Jesus if she isn't baptized.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.978
It just wouldn't be kosher.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.773
Well, could you do a quickie baptism,
you know, like a dunk 'n' go?

03:52.274 --> 03:56.194
I don't do dunk 'n' goes.
The big boss wouldn't approve.

03:56.278 --> 03:59.239
- The big boss?
- God, Bob.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.241
And you don't wanna piss him off.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.703
I'd have to baptize Patty properly.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.914
She would need spiritual counseling first
and then godparents.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.833
Well, is one enough?

04:09.916 --> 04:11.084
I suppose so.

04:11.168 --> 04:14.421
Great. Then I will be her godfather.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.673
Are you sure you are up to the task?

04:18.425 --> 04:22.554
Isn't it like you just say,
I'm her godfather and then it's done?

04:22.637 --> 04:25.432
- Like bibbidy bobbidi...
- That's a fairy godmother, Bob.

04:25.515 --> 04:26.683
Right. Got it.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.103
You would be pledging to be
Patty's spiritual mentor and role model

04:30.187 --> 04:31.480
for her entire life.

04:32.355 --> 04:35.567
Do you feel that you embody
the Fruits of the Spirit?

04:36.526 --> 04:37.778
I mean, yeah.

04:37.861 --> 04:40.989
I feel like my insides
are appropriately fruity.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.327
You wanna be my godfather?

04:45.410 --> 04:47.829
I have to be,
if we're gonna get you baptized.

04:47.913 --> 04:50.040
Otherwise, Pastor Mike
won't let you compete.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.375
I'm already your coach.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.710
It's not that big a leap,

04:53.794 --> 04:56.713
except being responsible for you
for the rest of your life.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.799
'Til death do us part?

04:59.174 --> 05:01.843
Hmm, more like a father figure.

05:01.927 --> 05:04.763
Meet me in Pastor Mike's office
as soon as orientation is over.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.598
We'll start spiritual counseling.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.892
<i>I've never looked
at Bob as a father.</i>

05:08.975 --> 05:12.813
<i>He was always more of a DILF,
but I was dating Bob's son.</i>

05:12.896 --> 05:15.899
<i>So, why not put Bob
in charge of my Holy Spirit?</i>

05:15.982 --> 05:18.360
- Move out of the way, Fatty.
- Suck it, Dixie.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.529
Not you. Her.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.281
Wasn't the plus-size pageant last week?

05:23.365 --> 05:25.492
Wasn't the pocket-sized pageant
last month?

05:25.575 --> 05:29.079
Or did you make a wrong turn
on the way to <i>Smurfs, the Musical?</i>

05:29.162 --> 05:31.373
It's cool. I got this.

05:31.790 --> 05:32.999
I like the way I look.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.501
That's why I do pageants.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.838
To show people that beauty
comes in all shapes and sizes.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.507
Even short little mofos like you.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.384
I think you might be my new best friend.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.594
I thought I was your new best friend.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.721
Did you get my text?

05:47.639 --> 05:49.474
Yeah, sorry. I was tied up.

05:51.268 --> 05:54.896
So, what do you think?
Is Brick seeing someone else?

05:55.814 --> 05:58.817
No way.
I'm sure you're just being paranoid.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.403
I saw you kiss him
at the dog wash, you slut!

06:04.364 --> 06:06.241
I gave you the chance to come clean

06:06.324 --> 06:09.327
and you just kept digging yourself
deeper and deeper into a hole.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.622
Screw you and your hole.
Nobody messes with my sister.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.333
We are not sisters.

06:15.417 --> 06:18.336
Yes, we are. We share a bedroom.
And a toothbrush.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.755
I knew you were using my toothbrush.
Don't do that.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.050
And you, you broke the girl code.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.553
You can't steal your friend's boyfriend.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.763
I didn't steal him.
You guys were broken up.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.892
I told you I wanted him back
and you went after him anyway.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.768
Could you be anymore selfish?

06:33.852 --> 06:36.271
You're selfish. Brick is happy.

06:36.354 --> 06:39.482
You dumped him
and now he likes me, so get over it.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.737
Oh, no she didn't.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.616
You think you're hot shit now
because you're skinny?

06:48.867 --> 06:50.619
You're a basic bitch.

06:50.702 --> 06:54.289
And I'm gonna beat your ass
in this pageant and every other pageant

06:54.372 --> 06:55.957
until the end of time.

06:56.041 --> 06:59.336
Hello, ladies.
Welcome to Miss Magic Jesus.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.712
Everybody take a seat.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.006
And if the choir
would start us off, please.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.722
What did she mean,
"now that you're skinny"?

07:11.765 --> 07:15.268
I lost 70 pounds.
So now it's my turn to get the guy.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.482
Being skinny don't mean shit
if you're ugly on the inside.

07:26.154 --> 07:29.658
Patty, the act of baptism means
dying to your old self

07:29.741 --> 07:32.953
and committing yourself
to a Christly existence.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.790
Jesus was so fully committed
to serving others,

07:36.873 --> 07:39.167
he was willing to die for their sins.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.836
A woman worthy of winning Miss Magic Jesus

07:41.920 --> 07:46.091
needs to focus on serving others,
instead of self-gratification.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.134
- What? No.
- Patty.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.261
I'm sorry.
What's wrong with self-gratification?

07:51.137 --> 07:54.224
I deserve to be happy.
I've spent years being miserable.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.394
The source of all misery is selfishness.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.312
That's the original sin.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.607
And I bet you could think of examples
from your own life

08:02.691 --> 08:06.820
when acting on selfish impulses
has caused pain to you or other people.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.073
Well I...

08:11.533 --> 08:14.494
I did just kiss my friend's boyfriend.
Or ex-boyfriend.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.371
And now she's really mad at me.

08:16.454 --> 08:19.749
- Wait, what?
- And I may have broken up Bob's marriage.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.961
Wow. You mean,
you two are "involved"?

08:23.044 --> 08:24.504
Absolutely not.

08:25.422 --> 08:32.095
Patty, let it slip to my wife
that I had an affair twenty years ago.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.388
Which I regret.

08:34.304 --> 08:37.267
Coralee is taking a break to think.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.020
And how's the rest of your family
taking the separation?

08:42.022 --> 08:44.149
I... Ugh, I don't know.

08:44.232 --> 08:48.903
My daughter's in Iraq and my son Brick
and I don't talk that much, so.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.656
Bob, you can't be
a good godfather to Patty

08:51.740 --> 08:54.200
if you can't be a good father to your son.

08:54.909 --> 08:59.080
And being a parent is the perfect way
to practice being of service.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.916
Trust me, I know.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.044
You have children?

09:04.627 --> 09:05.503
A son.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.172
Christian.

09:10.884 --> 09:15.680
You guys, this baptism
is a perfect opportunity

09:15.764 --> 09:17.474
for you both to change your lives.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.018
But you cannot reap the benefits
of being of service

09:20.101 --> 09:22.270
if you don't do the footwork first.

09:23.688 --> 09:24.773
So, where do we start?

09:25.940 --> 09:29.444
You should each pick
a simple act of selflessness.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.322
Bob, you should reach out to your son.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.365
Do something nice for him.

09:34.449 --> 09:37.619
And Patty, you might wanna
reach out to your friend.

09:37.702 --> 09:41.247
The one whose boyfriend you stole.
Might be a good way to make amends.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.752
Now if you both pursue this in earnest,

09:46.252 --> 09:49.714
I will baptize Patty
in time for Miss Magic Jesus.

09:49.881 --> 09:53.676
But, mark my words,
if you don't take it seriously,

09:53.760 --> 09:54.886
I will know.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.847
<i>I didn't believe this God stuff,
but he would never know.</i>

09:57.931 --> 10:00.683
<i>I did love my son
and I needed to get Patty baptized, so...</i>

10:00.767 --> 10:02.977
Bob, I'm serious.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.772
I have been blessed
with the gift of discernment.

10:06.523 --> 10:10.318
I can put my hands on someone's body
and see into their soul.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.403
I'll prove it.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.748
You were desperate.

10:25.083 --> 10:28.419
Ready to throw in the towel, end it all.

10:28.795 --> 10:29.921
<i>End it all?</i>

10:30.004 --> 10:32.382
<i>He couldn't possibly know
about the gun in my glove box.</i>

10:32.465 --> 10:33.716
But she saved you.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.884
Okay, that's enough.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.138
Um, so we will see you tomorrow.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.600
Be of service.

10:44.435 --> 10:48.648
<i>Maybe Pastor Mike was right.
With God, all things were possible.</i>

10:49.190 --> 10:51.776
<i>I could save my soul and win the crown.</i>

10:52.152 --> 10:55.238
<i>But first things first,
I needed to get baptized.</i>

10:55.321 --> 10:58.283
<i>Which meant I needed to do
something nice for Magnolia.</i>

10:58.867 --> 11:00.952
I'm gonna set Magnolia up with Christian.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.747
It's like a good deed
to make up for dating her ex.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.875
Couldn't you just stop dating Brick?

11:06.958 --> 11:08.042
I don't want to.

11:08.126 --> 11:12.088
Besides, Brick likes me now and Christian
and Magnolia are perfect for each other.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.466
He's hot, available, and they already know
each other 'cause he's her drug dealer.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.385
Sounds divinely inspired.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.596
Just don't become too
pure to watch Drew eat human flesh

11:19.679 --> 11:22.098
because we're binging season one
of <i>Santa Clarita Diet.</i>

11:22.182 --> 11:23.892
Oh, I can't.

11:23.975 --> 11:28.271
I've just got a lot to do this weekend
with the pageant and getting baptized

11:28.354 --> 11:29.689
and Brick.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.941
We'll watch it next weekend, I promise.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.612
I'll watch <i>Santa Clarita Diet</i> with you.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.323
It's not the same.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.034
So, do you wanna do something else?

11:41.451 --> 11:43.953
There's an open mic night
at a coffee house I like.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.123
You like to hang out in coffee houses?

11:47.749 --> 11:49.667
There's more to Choi than meets the eye.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.216
Hey.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.593
I think you should ask out
Magnolia Bernard.

11:58.676 --> 11:59.886
I think I should ask you out.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.556
Um, no. You screwed me over.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.766
Remember?

12:04.849 --> 12:06.726
Besides, you're a drug dealer.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.478
So judgmental.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.648
And anyway, I'm dating Brick Armstrong.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.442
Good for you. There's just one problem.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.862
You're not into Brick. You're into me.

12:18.780 --> 12:19.989
- That's not true.
- No?

12:20.365 --> 12:21.532
Hmm-mm.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.284
Why do you want me to ask out Magnolia?

12:23.368 --> 12:26.996
Because I'm trying to do something nice
for her by setting her up with a hot guy.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.581
Oh, see?

12:30.625 --> 12:31.793
You think I'm hot.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.254
That's not the point.

12:34.337 --> 12:39.550
So, you're not... feeling anything?

12:39.634 --> 12:41.886
Nope.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.265
Nothing at all?

12:45.348 --> 12:47.433
Hmm-mm.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.438
Then I'll never...

12:54.607 --> 12:55.733
ever...

12:57.986 --> 12:58.987
kiss you.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.781
Thanks for the tip about Magnolia.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.915
Hey. I have a proposition for you.

13:11.624 --> 13:12.875
I'm listening.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.920
I hear you're pissed
Brick is seeing Patty Bladell.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.255
You want him back?

13:17.338 --> 13:19.299
Why is this any of your business?

13:20.049 --> 13:23.636
What better way to make Brick jealous
than go out with the guy he hates most?

13:25.013 --> 13:26.472
What's in it for you?

13:26.848 --> 13:30.893
I'm into Patty and she's into me.
She's just in denial right now.

13:30.977 --> 13:34.856
So, you think if we go out...
it'll make them both crazy?

13:34.939 --> 13:37.775
Yeah. Like in one of those
stupid movies from the 80's.

13:38.568 --> 13:42.113
We could go to Brick's wrestling match,
make a spectacle of ourselves.

13:42.196 --> 13:46.451
I love spectacles.
Like the circus. I'll bring snacks.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.744
You are not coming.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.830
But I'm lonely! And I miss my momma.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.832
I have nobody to plot with.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.293
And now you're plotting revenge
and I want in.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.170
It's not a plot.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.380
It's a date.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.511
Hey.

14:07.638 --> 14:11.476
My dad has a pastry cooking class tonight,
so we'll have the house all to ourselves.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.480
It'd be really special.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.320
<i>Pastor Mike was right.</i>

14:22.403 --> 14:25.198
<i>I'd done something selfless,
and I was being rewarded.</i>

14:25.281 --> 14:28.159
<i>Maybe I could be of service to Brick too.</i>

14:32.789 --> 14:36.334
Hey, buddy. I was thinking about our talk.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.628
About how we never spend time together,

14:38.711 --> 14:42.090
and I was thinking maybe I could take you
shopping for some new clothes or...

14:42.173 --> 14:43.841
No, thanks. I have a date.

14:46.302 --> 14:50.431
Changing your own sheets? Roses, candles.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.017
You are having a sex date.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.186
Don't you have a pastry class to get to?

14:55.436 --> 14:57.522
- Are you back together with Magnolia?
- No.

14:58.815 --> 14:59.816
Well, who is it?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.609
None of your business.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.780
Is it another mom from school?

15:09.742 --> 15:10.618
Not funny, Dad.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.203
I agree.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.872
The fact that you had sex
with the one person

15:14.956 --> 15:16.666
I hate the most in the world

15:16.749 --> 15:18.167
is not funny. It's not funny at all.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.627
I'm not talking to you about this.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.379
Oh, I think we should.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.966
Did you do it to get back at me?

15:25.049 --> 15:27.885
You think I slept with Regina
because of you?

15:27.969 --> 15:31.514
I know that you were angry
that I am not more involved in your life.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.642
Maybe you did it
to try and get my attention.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.978
- I did it to get laid.
- Okay.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.729
Trust me, when I was with Regina,

15:38.813 --> 15:41.107
you were the last person
I was thinking about.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.859
But once again, thank you.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.902
Thank you for making everything
about yourself.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.571
Mom's right, you are a narcissist.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.532
Yeah. The last time I talked to her,
she called you that.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.742
I didn't know what it meant,
so I looked it up.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.828
Your mother should not
be calling me names,

15:53.911 --> 15:55.997
but I'm glad
you are improving your vocabulary.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.876
How are the rest of your studies?
Oh, come on.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.545
I'm trying to be more involved
in your life.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.423
Really? Do you even know I have
a huge wrestling tournament tomorrow?

16:06.132 --> 16:08.426
Oh, are you still doing that?

16:08.509 --> 16:09.552
Good talk, Dad.

16:12.263 --> 16:17.143
<i>It was clear, I needed to connect
with Brick on his terms, not mine.</i>

16:17.226 --> 16:19.812
<i>Which meant I had some research to do.</i>

16:19.896 --> 16:21.022
- Coach Al?
- Yeah?

16:21.105 --> 16:24.317
I'm Bob Armstrong. Brick's dad.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.736
I... Your assistant coach
said I could find you here.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.447
Brick's a great kid.
It's nice to finally meet you.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.408
I'm sorry
that I haven't come to see you sooner.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.953
I was hoping
you could explain wrestling to me,

16:36.037 --> 16:37.955
so I could be more supportive.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.584
- Bob?
- Bob?

16:41.667 --> 16:43.127
What are you doing here?

16:43.211 --> 16:46.631
I'm a wrestling booster.
Gotta keep up the team spirit. Go Merlins!

16:47.215 --> 16:49.592
Now, if you wanna know wrestling,
Mr. Armstrong,

16:49.675 --> 16:51.469
there's nobody better
to explain it than Bob.

16:52.887 --> 16:56.265
Really? 'Cause you're the coach.
It's kinda your job to explain.

16:56.349 --> 16:59.936
Who better than the former captain
of Masonville's championship team?

17:00.520 --> 17:05.107
<i>The last thing I wanted was to ask
Bob "Booster Club" Barnard for anything.</i>

17:05.608 --> 17:08.194
Happy to help. Here, put this on.

17:08.277 --> 17:11.280
What? You want me to wear a unitard?

17:11.364 --> 17:14.407
It's called a singlet.
Get dressed, I'll show you some moves.

17:14.492 --> 17:17.411
Oh, no. I just came here to talk.

17:17.494 --> 17:21.958
Easier to show than to tell.
That is, unless you're chicken.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.502
I am not... chicken.

17:25.586 --> 17:28.130
Great. Meet me in the gym in ten.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.636
Watch and follow.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.265
Now, you gotta lower your level.
Bend your knees, tuck your elbows.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.185
You gotta go lower, Bob.
It's gotta be lower.

17:41.269 --> 17:43.104
Yeah, that's it, just like that.

17:43.563 --> 17:48.067
Okay, first move I'm gonna show you,
it's called the penetration shot.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.654
Yeah. All right, now.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.448
Back, you step, knee down.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.367
Bring your knee up.

17:56.450 --> 17:57.660
Okay, your turn.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.165
That's it.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.334
How's Coralee? Talked to her?

18:05.418 --> 18:06.335
Have you?

18:06.752 --> 18:08.462
She's been checking in.

18:08.671 --> 18:12.675
Seems like she's still pretty upset.
You guys think you're gonna work it out?

18:15.219 --> 18:18.055
I'd be more worried about Magnolia
if I were you.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.474
How's she doing?
You talked to her about the drugs?

18:20.558 --> 18:22.852
- She's fine.
- I'm happy to hear.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.103
I was concerned.

18:24.395 --> 18:27.273
Especially with Miss Magic Jesus.

18:30.610 --> 18:35.740
The only thing I'd be concerned about
is Magnolia kicking Patty's ass.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.288
That's called finishing.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.426
<i>I had waited
for this moment for so long.</i>

18:55.509 --> 18:57.261
<i>To have Brick all to myself,</i>

18:57.845 --> 19:00.973
<i>but I couldn't get Christian
out of my head.</i>

19:01.307 --> 19:02.308
<i>I felt guilty.</i>

19:05.394 --> 19:06.437
I have a surprise for you.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.190
So you...

19:12.485 --> 19:16.155
open it while I open these.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.741
<i>But I couldn't help it.</i>

19:18.824 --> 19:21.702
<i>Christian smelled so good
and when he whispered in my ear,</i>

19:21.786 --> 19:23.704
<i>it was like my body was on fire.</i>

19:23.788 --> 19:25.706
<i>I was consumed with thoughts about...</i>

19:27.041 --> 19:28.668
<i>Brick, you decent?</i>

19:29.752 --> 19:32.129
Dad? I thought you had a pastry class?

19:32.213 --> 19:33.964
<i>I canceled. Permission to enter?</i>

19:34.965 --> 19:36.759
Denied. Talk through the door.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.845
<i>Well, after you pointed out
my lack of interest in wrestling,</i>

19:39.929 --> 19:41.305
<i>I did some research.</i>

19:41.389 --> 19:44.016
<i>Turns out the night before a big match,
you're supposed to keep</i>

19:44.100 --> 19:47.061
<i>all that testosterone and fluids
inside your body.</i>

19:47.144 --> 19:49.480
Dad, go away.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.358
<i>So, I'm gonna give you five seconds
to get decent.</i>

19:52.441 --> 19:54.527
<i>Five, four,</i>

19:54.610 --> 19:57.029
<i>- three, two...
- Shh!</i>

20:00.074 --> 20:00.950
Patty.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.203
She's the sex date?

20:04.286 --> 20:08.249
- You told him we were gonna have sex?
- No, I didn't tell him anything about us.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.334
- I told him not...
- I can't believe you.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.461
First, you sleep with my mortal enemy,

20:12.545 --> 20:14.839
and now you are trying
to seduce my <i>protÃ©gÃ©e.</i>

20:14.922 --> 20:17.341
Seriously?
You're gonna make this about you, again.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.594
Wait, is this some kind
of sick "eff you" to your dad?

20:20.678 --> 20:23.472
- No, Patty, I promise...
- You know what? I'm gonna go.

20:32.398 --> 20:36.360
<i>If Brick was using me,
I picked the wrong guy.</i>

20:37.111 --> 20:40.364
<i>But the guy I wanted,
I had set up with someone else.</i>

20:40.865 --> 20:43.159
<i>By being selfless, I had screwed myself.</i>

20:44.744 --> 20:48.497
What the hell, Dad?
I like Patty and you just cock blocked me.

20:48.581 --> 20:52.168
Brick, you have to be careful.
You can't toy with Patty's emotions.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.587
Seriously?
You're more worried about her than me?

20:54.670 --> 20:56.422
No. I am trying to protect you.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.800
Patty is... complicated.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.845
And when she gets upset, she acts out.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.181
I just don't wanna see you get hurt.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.767
Bullshit! You just don't want her to lose.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.645
Why are you suddenly
so interested in everything I do?

21:11.729 --> 21:13.606
I wanna be a good dad.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.108
Out of the blue. I mean, why now?

21:17.860 --> 21:20.154
I have been meeting with Pastor Mike

21:20.696 --> 21:22.698
and he says that if I wanna be
a good godfather,

21:22.782 --> 21:24.408
I need to be a better dad.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.285
- So I'm really trying.
- Godfather?

21:27.369 --> 21:29.079
- To who?
- To Patty.

21:29.163 --> 21:31.874
You're gonna be Patty's godfather?
Since when do you go to church?

21:31.957 --> 21:35.127
I don't. But Patty needs to be baptized
for Miss Magic Jesus,

21:35.211 --> 21:36.837
so it looks like I'd better start.

21:36.921 --> 21:40.424
Wow! Two children of your own, but that's
not enough to make you find religion.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.802
- But for Patty, I mean, we just...
- That's not what I meant.

21:42.885 --> 21:46.847
Look, hmm?
It's just Patty needs a father figure.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.766
Her mom is a mess.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.142
Right, and you're not?

21:55.439 --> 21:57.858
Thanks for the ride.

21:59.902 --> 22:01.237
I was glad you called.

22:02.404 --> 22:06.075
My AA meeting is starting soon,
but it's just around the corner.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.993
I could drop you off at home or...

22:09.328 --> 22:10.412
you could come with.

22:11.413 --> 22:13.833
I'd love to spend a little extra time,
you know?

22:17.419 --> 22:18.462
You okay?

22:19.046 --> 22:20.589
You've been unusually quiet.

22:21.632 --> 22:25.636
I think Brick might not be into me
for the right reasons.

22:26.136 --> 22:28.389
Oh, babe. I'm sorry.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.850
I know how excited you've been about that.

22:30.933 --> 22:33.310
You've been into him for such a long time.

22:33.894 --> 22:34.895
Hmm.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.776
And I'm sorry
about the whole baptism thing.

22:40.860 --> 22:44.321
You know, you were right.
It's a big deal. I should have done it.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.365
But I'll be there Sunday.

22:46.448 --> 22:48.742
Better late than never, right?

22:48.826 --> 22:51.287
Yeah, if Pastor Mike
agrees to go through with it.

22:51.996 --> 22:55.291
He wants me to think less about myself
and more about other people,

22:55.374 --> 22:57.001
but I already did a selfless good deed.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.920
I set Magnolia up with another guy
to make up for stealing Brick.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.006
Wait, you stole Brick?

23:03.674 --> 23:05.467
Oh my God, he's here.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.761
The guy that I set Magnolia up with.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.680
That I like better.

23:09.763 --> 23:10.973
Maybe that's a sign...

23:11.515 --> 23:13.225
that I should be with him instead.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.644
Wait, you stole Brick from Magnolia

23:15.728 --> 23:18.022
and now you're gonna steal
the other guy too?

23:18.105 --> 23:21.358
- Does Pastor Mike sign off on this?
- No.

23:21.442 --> 23:24.153
'Cause it doesn't sound like
you're thinking about other people.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.906
It sounds like you're being selfish.

23:26.989 --> 23:29.825
Says the woman who was too busy
getting drunk to get me baptized.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.786
You think I'm selfish? Great.
Turning out just like you.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.337
Hey. What are you doing here?

23:41.420 --> 23:43.714
It doesn't matter. Do you have a car?

23:44.089 --> 23:46.383
Do you wanna go for a drive or something?

24:06.570 --> 24:08.948
You have a great voice too.
You should get up there and sing.

24:09.031 --> 24:09.990
Shh.

24:22.836 --> 24:23.963
Thank you.

24:24.046 --> 24:27.675
If any of you are interested in seeing
a beauty pageant contestant

24:27.758 --> 24:30.594
who eats something
besides celery and rice cakes,

24:30.678 --> 24:34.348
come out and support me
in Miss Magic Jesus this weekend.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.314
So...

24:43.732 --> 24:47.945
you never answered my question
about Patty.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.573
I told you to let me know
when you've figured out how you feel

24:51.657 --> 24:53.742
and you've been dodging me ever since.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.953
I'm not dodging you,
I'm here with you right now.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.789
But I want this to be like a date

24:58.872 --> 25:03.002
and I don't know if it is
because I don't know if you're gay.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.586
Neither do I, okay?

25:10.884 --> 25:12.553
Look, I'm not stupid.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.764
I know what people say about me,

25:16.765 --> 25:20.227
even before the whole Dixie vag pic thing.

25:21.979 --> 25:24.940
And I've thought about it... a lot.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.818
Like, whether or not it's true.

25:29.069 --> 25:29.903
And?

25:31.155 --> 25:33.866
And it's not like
I check out girls in school,

25:34.575 --> 25:37.119
like, in the hallway
or in the locker room.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.289
Except normal,

25:40.372 --> 25:43.167
are-her-boobs-bigger-than-mine
kinda stuff.

25:43.250 --> 25:44.376
That's so hot.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.712
I just don't think I'm into girls.

25:48.047 --> 25:53.385
- Okay. So...
- But I do think I might be into Patty.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.310
Oh my God! You must hate me.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.397
The opposite, actually.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.650
Like, a lot the opposite.

26:08.984 --> 26:13.322
- Which sucks for me a little bit.
- I can't believe I just told you that.

26:13.781 --> 26:15.115
I gotta...

26:31.090 --> 26:32.925
Hey. You okay?

26:33.425 --> 26:34.384
I'm fine.

26:35.177 --> 26:36.095
You don't look fine.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.680
I'm not fine.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.266
- Wanna talk about it?
- Ugh.

26:41.642 --> 26:42.851
Definitely not.

26:44.103 --> 26:47.564
I've already overshared tonight.
And you're a total stranger.

26:48.690 --> 26:52.277
Which means you can tell me
pretty much anything and it'll be safe.

26:54.196 --> 26:57.157
Beats hiding out in a bathroom...
feeling alone.

26:57.991 --> 26:58.951
Right?

27:01.370 --> 27:04.248
I just told a guy who likes me
that I'm in love with my best friend.

27:06.208 --> 27:08.585
Does she know? Your best friend?

27:09.962 --> 27:11.255
What makes you think it's a she?

27:12.047 --> 27:13.090
I don't know.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.008
Just a vibe.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.886
Is it not a she?

27:17.970 --> 27:21.265
No, it is, but I'm putting out a vibe?

27:21.348 --> 27:23.934
- Have you told your friend how you feel?
- No. God, no.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.477
Have you guys ever...?

27:25.561 --> 27:27.771
Okay, you ask a lot of questions.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.107
I'm a very curious person.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.449
Listen.

27:40.284 --> 27:43.078
I know we're strangers,
but if you don't wanna be,

27:44.163 --> 27:46.665
you should call me.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.337
Or you can just tell your friend.

27:52.421 --> 27:55.924
Because if I was her, I'd be all in.

28:07.019 --> 28:07.936
So...

28:09.396 --> 28:11.565
about setting you up with Magnolia.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.068
I think maybe I shouldn't have done that.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.945
Why? It was a great idea.

28:17.613 --> 28:20.824
Going to the wrestling meet together,
so, thanks.

28:21.491 --> 28:22.409
She's hot.

28:23.410 --> 28:24.995
I get why she's a beauty queen.

28:25.913 --> 28:27.289
But not you.

28:27.915 --> 28:30.083
Why, because you think
she's prettier than me?

28:30.167 --> 28:32.461
Because you seem rock n' roll.

28:33.378 --> 28:37.257
Pageants seem so... Michael BublÃ©.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.092
Rock n' roll?

28:39.718 --> 28:40.928
Are you, like, forty?

28:41.011 --> 28:43.055
Don't even get me started.

28:45.849 --> 28:46.975
AC/DC.

28:47.684 --> 28:49.228
Led Zeppelin. Ozzy?

28:49.853 --> 28:51.313
They're all, like, old.

28:51.730 --> 28:55.859
There's no real rock anymore,
nothing that tells the truth.

28:56.360 --> 28:59.279
Okay. Clearly this is a subject
you've thought a lot about.

28:59.363 --> 29:00.948
We all have our passions.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.952
Yours apparently is pageants,
which I'll never understand.

29:05.035 --> 29:06.453
I do it for revenge.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.291
Oh, that's rock n' roll.

29:16.129 --> 29:18.215
What are you doing?

29:18.298 --> 29:20.259
I wanna give this
my full attention.

29:21.843 --> 29:22.970
What revenge?

29:24.263 --> 29:25.555
I used to be fat.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.350
And people tortured me.

29:29.226 --> 29:32.729
And I wanna show everyone
who was mean to me that they're all losers

29:32.813 --> 29:34.231
and that I'm a winner.

29:34.314 --> 29:35.565
I knew it.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.860
From the second I sat next you,
I could feel it.

29:38.944 --> 29:40.028
Knew what?

29:40.112 --> 29:41.530
You're angry.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.156
Twisted.

29:43.782 --> 29:44.825
Hungry.

29:46.076 --> 29:47.077
Like me.

29:50.539 --> 29:51.707
No, we can't.

29:52.541 --> 29:53.417
We can.

29:56.253 --> 29:57.296
What about Magnolia?

29:58.046 --> 30:00.632
You said you shouldn't have set us up.
Who cares?

30:01.550 --> 30:04.136
I do. I'm trying not to be selfish.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.397
- Who is it?
- Brick.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.858
Loser.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.110
He's not a loser.

30:22.112 --> 30:23.530
He's my boyfriend.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.701
And I'm gonna call an Uber.

30:30.245 --> 30:32.831
<i>Christian may have seen
the person I was,</i>

30:32.914 --> 30:35.042
<i>but Brick saw the person I wanted to be.</i>

30:35.584 --> 30:38.086
<i>And if I wanted Pastor Mike
to see that I had changed,</i>

30:38.170 --> 30:41.590
<i>I needed to stay as far away
from Christian as possible.</i>

30:44.092 --> 30:47.262
I got into a fight with my daughter.
She called me selfish.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.097
And I think she's right.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.559
- Just makes me wanna say, "Fuck it".
- I hear you.

30:52.642 --> 30:55.145
Throw out my 33 days and get drunk.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.522
- Exactly.
- To feel good.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.316
Or even just better.

31:00.650 --> 31:03.737
Anything to fill this God-sized hole.

31:05.739 --> 31:08.825
Shit! Oh my God! I did it again.

31:09.326 --> 31:12.954
Uh... Oh. And you're my sponsor, so...

31:14.289 --> 31:16.166
What the hell is wrong with me?

31:17.626 --> 31:20.712
- There is nothing wrong with you.
- What are you talking about?

31:20.796 --> 31:23.882
I slept with the closest thing
I had to a spiritual advisor.

31:23.965 --> 31:28.929
And now I need a new one so badly that
I had to ask you to make a house call.

31:30.514 --> 31:33.558
- Thank you for coming, by the way.
- Oh, no, I was glad you reached out.

31:34.351 --> 31:38.939
Everything happens for a reason, Angie,
and God is everything or God is nothing.

31:39.481 --> 31:41.483
They say that in AA.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.527
Are you a twelve-stepper?

31:44.694 --> 31:46.405
Let's just say I have a past.

31:46.488 --> 31:47.656
Booze?

31:48.156 --> 31:49.616
Drugs? Gambling?

31:49.699 --> 31:50.534
Strippers?

31:50.617 --> 31:53.203
It doesn't matter,
except that it brought me to God.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.915
Fine. Don't tell me. You're no fun.

31:56.998 --> 31:59.418
No, I'm fun. But it's the kind of fun
that lands you in jail.

32:00.293 --> 32:04.339
The good news about hitting bottom
is that the only place to go is up.

32:04.423 --> 32:08.260
But you have to be willing to do the work.
You have to be willing to save yourself.

32:08.718 --> 32:11.430
You need to bring your attention
back to you.

32:11.513 --> 32:14.224
But I thought you told Patty
to be less focused on herself?

32:14.307 --> 32:17.310
Well, I'm not talking about selfishness,
I'm talking about self-care.

32:18.395 --> 32:22.441
You need to be able to meet your own needs
without looking outside yourself.

32:22.524 --> 32:26.403
Because no amount of drinkingÂ or drugging

32:26.486 --> 32:29.281
or sex is gonna fix you.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.409
It really is an inside job.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.663
See, Pastor Mike,
when you say "inside job,"

32:37.247 --> 32:38.999
I think of something else.

32:39.207 --> 32:43.920
Angie, we need to get you
back to the real you.

32:44.004 --> 32:48.508
Before the booze
and the sex and the drugs.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.639
Honestly, I don't remember.

32:58.059 --> 32:59.769
Hey, but I have some old journals.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.314
Maybe I could find some answers in there.

33:02.397 --> 33:03.899
Here's to finding answers.

33:04.441 --> 33:05.484
Answers.

33:06.902 --> 33:10.530
<i>I was determined to show Brick
that I cared about him.</i>

33:10.614 --> 33:12.991
<i>And now that I knew
some tricks of the trade,</i>

33:13.074 --> 33:15.994
<i>I was gonna be
the most supportive father in the crowd.</i>

33:16.077 --> 33:18.371
That is a technical violation!

33:19.539 --> 33:21.917
- Hey, how's Brick doing?
<i>- </i> Great!

33:22.000 --> 33:23.627
But that other boy is a cheater,

33:23.710 --> 33:25.962
plus his onesie
is not doing him any favors.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.007
- I don't think that's what it's...
- Go, Brick!

33:30.509 --> 33:32.093
Be his boss!

33:32.886 --> 33:36.306
Listen, Patty. I hope you understand,
but I am here to support Brick.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.600
I don't want him to think
I'm here to talk to you, so.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.810
Yeah, sure. I get it.

33:49.569 --> 33:52.072
- Patty's totally looking.
- Brick's not.

33:53.156 --> 33:55.408
So. Do you wanna stop?

33:55.492 --> 33:56.618
Actually...

33:57.786 --> 33:58.620
no.

34:01.706 --> 34:02.749
This one's for you, babe.

34:08.420 --> 34:10.047
Hey. I didn't know you were coming.

34:10.130 --> 34:12.676
Your mom said you'd be here.
I wanted to talk to you.

34:12.759 --> 34:15.262
A weird thing happened to me last night
and I feel kind of crazy.

34:15.344 --> 34:17.054
Oh my God, I feel crazy.

34:17.138 --> 34:19.933
I set up Magnolia and Christian
so Magnolia wouldn't be mad about Brick,

34:20.016 --> 34:21.976
but now I can't stop
thinking about Christian.

34:22.060 --> 34:25.438
But I can't steel her boyfriend
a second time, that would be selfish.

34:25.522 --> 34:26.731
Oh my God! Seriously?

34:27.274 --> 34:30.277
Uh! Which hot guy should I be with?
Nobody cares!

34:30.360 --> 34:31.902
Helmet, helmet!

34:35.364 --> 34:36.908
Nonnie, slow down!

34:36.992 --> 34:39.661
Hey, wait! What's wrong?

34:39.744 --> 34:42.956
I told you something crazy happened
to me, but you ran right over it.

34:43.039 --> 34:46.293
- I'm sorry. What happened?
- A girl asked me out.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.337
- What d'you say?
- I didn't really say anything.

34:51.005 --> 34:52.632
Okay, so what's the crazy thing?

34:52.966 --> 34:53.882
That's it!

34:53.967 --> 34:57.304
I just told you. It totally freaks me out.

34:57.387 --> 34:59.222
She said I put out a vibe.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.520
Do you think I put out a vibe?

35:05.604 --> 35:07.772
- A vibe, what kind of vibe?
- A gay vibe!

35:09.107 --> 35:11.318
I don't know,
I've never really thought about it.

35:11.401 --> 35:13.278
Yeah, of course
you've never thought about it.

35:13.361 --> 35:17.032
You've never, ever thought about it,
that's the fucking problem!

35:17.115 --> 35:19.242
- Why are you getting so upset?
- Because!

35:20.201 --> 35:21.202
This!

35:32.589 --> 35:33.590
Nonnie.

35:34.674 --> 35:35.675
I love you.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.138
More than anyone in the world.

35:40.930 --> 35:43.099
But not like that.

35:47.187 --> 35:48.396
Oh, God.

35:49.022 --> 35:50.315
Oh my God.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.858
I've ruined everything.

35:51.941 --> 35:53.985
No. No you didn't.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.029
- Nothing has to change.
- Of course it does.

35:56.112 --> 35:58.365
- Wait.
- Everything's different now.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.408
Why? I don't care.

36:01.743 --> 36:04.829
Oh my God! You always make it about you!

36:04.913 --> 36:06.206
What do you mean, "always"?

36:07.165 --> 36:08.750
Even before you got skinny,

36:08.833 --> 36:13.088
even before Bob and pageants
and the fucking hot guys,

36:13.171 --> 36:15.423
all we ever talked about was you.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.676
How you felt, what you wanted,

36:17.759 --> 36:21.513
and now I'm finally,
finally figuring out what I want

36:21.596 --> 36:23.932
and you're still making it about you?

36:25.433 --> 36:27.769
God! Could you be more self-involved?

36:35.485 --> 36:36.986
Penetrate him!

36:38.363 --> 36:39.739
Penetrate him!

36:39.823 --> 36:41.324
Finish him off!

36:45.954 --> 36:48.790
<i>- Brick Armstrong is down...
- </i> Hold up, son. Easy.

36:49.124 --> 36:50.250
What happened?

36:51.501 --> 36:52.544
I messed up.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.421
Yeah, me too.

36:54.504 --> 36:55.547
Easy.

36:55.839 --> 36:56.965
Are you... Is he all right?

36:57.048 --> 36:58.925
Yeah, it looks like it's just a sprain.

36:59.008 --> 37:01.386
- Oh, thank God.
- Are you kidding me?

37:02.011 --> 37:04.389
This was my biggest meet of the season
and you ruined it.

37:05.682 --> 37:08.393
I like it a lot better
when you didn't care about me, so...

37:09.310 --> 37:10.979
don't ever come
to any of my matches again.

37:12.188 --> 37:15.191
<i>Let's hear it for him, folks.
Brick Armstrong.</i>

37:18.111 --> 37:22.824
All I do is hurt him,
like my dad did to me. I...

37:23.908 --> 37:27.495
I wish I could just wave a magic wand
and be a better dad.

37:27.787 --> 37:29.414
Like a fairy godmother.

37:30.498 --> 37:31.332
Maybe you can.

37:33.334 --> 37:34.544
Get baptized with me tomorrow.

37:35.628 --> 37:38.047
Pastor Mike says it's a new beginning,
a fresh start.

37:38.131 --> 37:40.133
Look. I'd love to believe

37:40.216 --> 37:42.719
that a dip in a kiddie pool
will wash away all my sins

37:42.802 --> 37:46.931
and save my marriage
and improve my relationship with Brick,

37:47.015 --> 37:51.019
but it seems like kind of a lofty
expectation, don't you think?

37:53.313 --> 37:54.647
What do you have to lose?

37:56.232 --> 37:59.944
<i>She had already saved me once
when I was going to end it all.</i>

38:00.195 --> 38:01.738
<i>Maybe she could do it again.</i>

38:02.655 --> 38:04.032
A double dunk.

38:04.741 --> 38:07.494
Well, I like it.
That is, if you're both ready.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.248
Bob.

38:15.919 --> 38:18.963
Mm. So much longing.

38:19.047 --> 38:22.300
Yeah, to fix things with my son.
I really screwed that up.

38:22.383 --> 38:23.802
It's more than that.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.972
You have a God-sized hole.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.768
I don't know what that means.

38:31.851 --> 38:35.647
It means nothing
will ever be enough to fill you up.

38:36.397 --> 38:38.817
Nothing, except the Holy Spirit.

38:41.486 --> 38:44.447
Okay. Am I good to go or what?

38:45.073 --> 38:46.074
You are.

38:46.699 --> 38:49.619
And Bob, whatever it is
you're yearning for,

38:50.119 --> 38:51.371
God will provide.

38:54.499 --> 38:55.500
Patty.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.550
What? What's wrong?

39:04.175 --> 39:05.260
That's a lot going on there.

39:05.927 --> 39:08.137
- You need this more than I thought.
- I know.

39:08.596 --> 39:10.515
I'm starting to wonder
if I'm terminally selfish.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.433
Patty... Shh! Of course you're not.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.561
Hold on, Bob. Patty, what do you mean?

39:15.103 --> 39:16.896
My best friend told me
she was in love with me.

39:16.980 --> 39:19.899
- I could have told you that.
- And I said all of the wrong things.

39:19.983 --> 39:22.485
All I can think about
is getting what I want.

39:22.569 --> 39:24.904
I think even this selfless thing
that I did was all about me.

39:24.988 --> 39:27.156
Patty, stop! We need to get you baptized.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.868
We really do. She really needs this.

39:32.287 --> 39:33.788
What if it doesn't work?

39:34.205 --> 39:37.417
Have you ever had someone
who couldn't be saved?

39:37.500 --> 39:38.626
No.

39:40.169 --> 39:41.004
Not yet.

39:42.422 --> 39:43.715
We'll start in a few minutes.

39:46.968 --> 39:48.469
- Hi.
- Pastor Mike.

39:48.553 --> 39:51.222
- Oh, hi.
- I found something. In my journal.

39:51.306 --> 39:52.307
Okay.

39:53.683 --> 39:56.769
It's a list of all the guys I slept with.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.313
From when I was 17.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.982
Wow. Wow! You were busy.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.318
Kinda thought of it as a badge of honor.

40:03.693 --> 40:05.069
But I was only Patty's age.

40:05.153 --> 40:09.365
And the thought of her like this,
I don't want her to turn out like me.

40:10.283 --> 40:11.326
I need your help.

40:12.118 --> 40:14.579
Tomorrow. Today is Patty's day.

40:15.079 --> 40:17.457
Right. Today's not about me.

40:20.835 --> 40:21.711
Oh.

40:28.509 --> 40:29.344
Hey.

40:30.637 --> 40:33.389
I'm sorry for overreacting
to you guys dating.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.100
You are?

40:37.518 --> 40:39.312
Turns out it was for the best.

40:40.647 --> 40:42.982
I like Christian, a lot.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.819
So... friends?

40:49.155 --> 40:50.281
- Friends.
- Friends.

40:50.365 --> 40:51.658
To you guys.

40:56.788 --> 40:57.830
Wow.

40:58.623 --> 40:59.666
That's a relief.

40:59.749 --> 41:01.417
Did you just make up with Patty?

41:01.876 --> 41:04.963
No. I spiked her cider with liquid molly.

41:05.046 --> 41:08.800
When Pastor Mike sees she's high,
she'll be out of Miss Magic Jesus.

41:09.092 --> 41:10.551
Nobody fucks with a Barnard.

41:12.011 --> 41:13.012
Oh my God.

41:14.889 --> 41:16.849
We are sisters.

41:19.018 --> 41:23.398
We are therefore buried into baptism
with Him through death.

41:23.940 --> 41:28.778
Just as Christ was raised from the dead
through the glory of the Father,

41:28.861 --> 41:31.197
we too may live a new life.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.115
Bob.

41:32.198 --> 41:35.952
<i>For the first time in days,
I finally felt peace.</i>

41:40.832 --> 41:43.668
<i>I could already feel
the power of the Spirit.</i>

41:46.587 --> 41:51.509
<i>I felt warm, ecstatic.
Like I was pure love.</i>

41:52.760 --> 41:56.014
<i>It was a truly religious experience.</i>

41:56.389 --> 41:58.683
<i>I almost felt like I was high.</i>

42:00.351 --> 42:02.770
<i>I just knew once I was dunked,</i>

42:03.396 --> 42:09.485
<i>all my selfishness would be gone
and everything was going to be fine.</i>

42:21.748 --> 42:24.584
<i>Hey. Hey!</i>

42:24.959 --> 42:26.252
<i>Down here.</i>

42:26.335 --> 42:29.005
<i>Yeah, it's me, the donut.</i>

42:29.797 --> 42:31.466
<i>I'm talking to you.</i>

42:31.549 --> 42:34.260
<i>Are you God?</i>

42:34.343 --> 42:38.014
<i>No. I'm your hole.
Your God-sized hole.</i>

42:38.097 --> 42:42.852
<i>The reason you're obsessed with food
and boys and Bob.</i>

42:42.935 --> 42:44.812
<i>What do you want?</i>

42:45.021 --> 42:47.190
<i>I want you to fill me up.</i>

42:47.440 --> 42:50.985
<i>Oh, you'll never be satisfied
unless you take what you want.</i>

42:51.069 --> 42:55.698
I thought
I was supposed to be self "less."

42:56.240 --> 42:59.243
<i>Screw selflessness. You only live once.</i>

42:59.327 --> 43:02.330
<i>Don't let that hot bad boy get away.</i>

43:19.555 --> 43:21.557
Patty's high. Look!

43:24.852 --> 43:27.980
Yes! She was moved by the Spirit.

43:28.064 --> 43:29.482
Oh, that's just bullshit.

43:31.150 --> 43:33.152
God damn it. I'm so sorry, all.

43:34.403 --> 43:38.324
<i>I knew exactly what I wanted.
And exactly what I had to do.</i>

43:38.908 --> 43:40.743
We need to break up, sorry.

43:40.827 --> 43:42.703
<i>- Pastor Mike was wrong.</i>
- Hey, babe...

43:43.162 --> 43:44.789
<i>It wasn't time to be selfless...</i>

43:45.164 --> 43:46.999
You. Come with me.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.710
<i>It was time for me
to finally get what I want.</i>

43:53.756 --> 43:57.176
<i>Patty may have been moved
by the Spirit, but I just felt...</i>

43:57.260 --> 43:59.428
<i>Wet.</i>

44:00.304 --> 44:01.597
<i>Nothing had changed.</i>

44:02.890 --> 44:03.975
Hey, buddy.

44:07.019 --> 44:07.854
You okay?

44:09.147 --> 44:10.398
Patty broke up with me.

44:11.899 --> 44:15.444
My first straight blow off and I really...

44:17.238 --> 44:18.197
I really liked her.

44:20.449 --> 44:21.576
I'm sorry...

44:22.076 --> 44:23.536
for making it about me.

44:25.204 --> 44:26.164
Well, I...

44:27.456 --> 44:28.958
I was thinking about the Regina thing.

44:30.251 --> 44:31.586
You were right, Dad...

44:32.962 --> 44:34.172
that was about you.

44:36.048 --> 44:36.924
So...

44:38.676 --> 44:39.510
sorry.

44:47.435 --> 44:48.936
Coach told me you stopped by.

44:50.146 --> 44:52.440
- And that you let Barnard kick your ass.
- Yeah.

44:52.523 --> 44:55.318
- I even put on a body suit.
- It's a singlet.

44:57.778 --> 44:58.613
Thanks, Dad.

45:05.036 --> 45:08.372
<i>Maybe miracles
were possible after all.</i>

45:23.596 --> 45:27.475
<i>It was finally my time
to get what I wanted.</i>

45:28.476 --> 45:32.188
Wait. I don't have protection.
We don't want any surprises.

45:32.939 --> 45:33.981
Seriously?

45:34.065 --> 45:37.401
Relax. There's other stuff we can do.

45:39.111 --> 45:42.240
I'm gonna do something nice for you.

45:50.706 --> 45:51.707
Oh, God.
