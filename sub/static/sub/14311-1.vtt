00:15.270 --> 00:17.689
<i>Tell me there's something better.</i>

00:21.485 --> 00:23.779
<i>Go ahead. Try.</i>

00:24.488 --> 00:27.199
<i>"How I Spent My Summer Vacation"...</i>

00:27.407 --> 00:28.951
<i>...by Peter Benjamin Parker.</i>

00:29.159 --> 00:32.662
<i>I can sum it up in one glorious,
hyphenated word.</i>

00:33.163 --> 00:34.331
<i>Spider-Man.</i>

00:34.540 --> 00:38.710
I am the Spectacular Spider-Man.

00:39.795 --> 00:41.421
<i>Only one thing missing.</i>

00:41.630 --> 00:44.174
<i>It's my last night
before school starts...</i>

00:44.383 --> 00:47.553
<i>...and I could really use some action.</i>

01:02.734 --> 01:05.404
Did I tell you? One getaway jump
to the next building...

01:05.612 --> 01:08.991
-...and we're a million bucks richer.
- This ain't no million-buck haul.

01:09.199 --> 01:13.745
- Not after the Big Man takes his cut.
- Shut up and jump.

01:15.038 --> 01:17.666
O'Hirn? Oh, no. Not again.

01:17.874 --> 01:19.626
Yep, again.

01:19.835 --> 01:22.087
What is this, Marko,
the third time this summer?

01:22.296 --> 01:25.632
Just wait till I get my hands on you,
you skinny little creep.

01:27.926 --> 01:30.721
Okay, so, Marko, now tell me.
The new Spider-Signal.

01:30.929 --> 01:33.140
Too much?
It's my first night trying it out.

01:33.348 --> 01:37.269
And I'm just not sure it screams
friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

01:37.477 --> 01:38.562
Be brutal.

01:38.770 --> 01:42.858
As a guy with a lot of experience
getting thrashed by, well, me...

01:43.900 --> 01:45.360
<i>...I really value your opinion.</i>

01:45.569 --> 01:47.904
This is a live feed?

01:48.113 --> 01:49.448
Then I've seen enough.

01:49.656 --> 01:50.782
Summon the Enforcers.

01:51.199 --> 01:53.285
Already on their way.

03:03.689 --> 03:06.316
<i>I've never been so pumped
for the first day of school.</i>

03:06.525 --> 03:09.528
<i>Because today everything changes.</i>

03:12.030 --> 03:14.324
It isn't getting any easier, Anna.

03:14.533 --> 03:15.826
We're almost out of money.

03:16.034 --> 03:20.038
- But May, I'm sure Ben left you with--
- Ben Parker was many...

03:20.247 --> 03:21.957
...many wonderful things.

03:22.165 --> 03:24.376
But a financial wizard he was not.

03:26.878 --> 03:29.506
I miss him so.

03:29.715 --> 03:32.008
Oh, but listen to me go on.

03:32.217 --> 03:33.510
We'll manage.

03:33.719 --> 03:36.346
And, please,
not a word of this to Peter.

03:36.555 --> 03:39.182
I wouldn't want him to be concerned.

03:39.391 --> 03:42.018
Hey, Aunt May.
How's the most beautiful girl...

03:42.227 --> 03:46.189
-...in Forest Hills this morning?
- Oh, Peter.

03:46.398 --> 03:49.776
Now, hurry off. You don't
wanna be late on your first day.

03:49.985 --> 03:51.069
No, ma'am.

03:58.910 --> 04:00.537
I blame you for this.

04:00.746 --> 04:04.583
You told me to bring my Magnetic
Air Transport System to OsCorp.

04:04.791 --> 04:06.710
- I know--
- You arranged the meeting...

04:06.918 --> 04:09.546
-...with Norman Osborn.
- And I had the best intention.

04:09.755 --> 04:12.424
He studied my ideas
and rejected them.

04:12.632 --> 04:15.427
Then announces OsCorp Tech-Flight
four months later.

04:16.428 --> 04:19.555
- I am sorry, Adrian--
- Don't you dare apologize, doctor.

04:19.765 --> 04:22.559
OsCorp has nothing to apologize for.

04:22.768 --> 04:25.896
Nothing to--
Osborn, you stole my work.

04:26.104 --> 04:28.315
That's dangerous talk, Mr. Toomes.

04:28.523 --> 04:30.817
Dangerous and unsupportable.

04:31.026 --> 04:32.319
Listen, you old buzzard.

04:32.527 --> 04:36.281
You've been at this for decades
without one success to your name.

04:36.615 --> 04:39.242
If you never accomplished anything
as a young man...

04:39.451 --> 04:43.288
...who'd believe you created
Tech-Flight as an old one?

04:43.789 --> 04:47.459
Boys, show Mr. Toomes out.

04:48.668 --> 04:53.548
Good news,
I don't blame you anymore.

05:02.474 --> 05:04.392
<i>All right...</i>

05:04.601 --> 05:06.895
<i>...the Parkers are desperate
for cold hard cash...</i>

05:07.103 --> 05:09.439
<i>...but I'm not letting that
spoil this moment.</i>

05:09.648 --> 05:11.775
- Hey, Pete.
- Harry. Gwen.

05:11.983 --> 05:14.277
- How'd summer treat you?
- Science camp was fun.

05:14.486 --> 05:16.446
Yeah, well, the world tour stunk.

05:16.655 --> 05:19.282
My dad spent the whole trip
locked in boardrooms.

05:19.491 --> 05:21.618
So I spent mine locked in boredom.

05:21.827 --> 05:23.495
I should have stayed with you, Pete.

05:23.703 --> 05:26.998
Least we could have done
nothing together.

05:27.582 --> 05:29.084
But now we're back.

05:29.292 --> 05:31.962
So you ready for the torture
that is M-cubed?

05:32.170 --> 05:34.464
It'll be different now.

05:52.691 --> 05:57.529
Really? Because you spent half of
sophomore year stuffed in a locker.

05:58.196 --> 06:00.156
Pete? Where you going?

06:00.365 --> 06:01.992
<i>To face my destiny.</i>

06:02.200 --> 06:04.995
<i>Peter Parker's a wall-crawler,
not a Wallflower.</i>

06:05.203 --> 06:08.039
<i>And my life is about to change.</i>

06:11.126 --> 06:12.711
Sally?

06:13.628 --> 06:16.047
What's he--? Is he?

06:16.548 --> 06:17.716
I think he is.

06:17.924 --> 06:20.302
- Are you damaged?
- He did.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.178
Why do you think I'd ever go out...

06:22.387 --> 06:24.472
...with Midtown High's
champion geek?

06:24.681 --> 06:27.517
Hey, Rand, Puny Parker's
hitting on your girl.

06:27.726 --> 06:30.562
- Rand, I didn't know you two were--
- It's cool.

06:30.770 --> 06:32.731
Cool? You don't care?

06:33.064 --> 06:35.358
Why? You wanna go out with him?

06:35.567 --> 06:39.279
I want to walk on a Parker-free planet,
thank you very much.

06:41.448 --> 06:43.742
Lucky you didn't try this with my girl,
Parker.

06:43.950 --> 06:46.244
If your geek sweat got
within one mile of Liz--

06:46.453 --> 06:47.537
Back off, Flash.

06:47.746 --> 06:49.748
I won't be your punching bag
anymore.

06:49.956 --> 06:51.249
Things have changed.

06:59.174 --> 07:04.262
You hear him threaten me, dude?
The nerd thinks he's Spider-Man.

07:05.096 --> 07:06.306
Pound cake.

07:07.682 --> 07:09.976
Oh, my lunch.

07:19.402 --> 07:23.073
Come on. The Big Man wants a word.

07:23.448 --> 07:26.409
Enforcers all present
and accounted for, boss.

07:26.618 --> 07:27.702
<i>Thank you, Hammerhead.</i>

07:27.911 --> 07:29.412
<i>I'll get right to the point.</i>

07:29.621 --> 07:33.583
<i>For the last four months,
a pest has plagued our operations.</i>

07:33.917 --> 07:36.252
<i>At first, I could hardly credit
the reports.</i>

07:36.461 --> 07:38.713
Thought the boys
were trying to stiff us.

07:38.922 --> 07:43.385
Had to get a little rough
to make sure they was sincere.

07:43.593 --> 07:46.262
<i>Establishing patterns of movement
took all summer.</i>

07:46.471 --> 07:49.099
<i>But last night we had confirmation.</i>

07:49.307 --> 07:52.102
<i>The Spider-Man is real.</i>

07:52.310 --> 07:55.605
And you want the Enforcers
to wrangle up this here spider?

07:55.814 --> 08:00.276
<i>No, Montana. I want you to squash it.</i>

08:09.244 --> 08:11.621
Chapter 1 by tomorrow,
ladies and gentlemen.

08:11.830 --> 08:13.665
Mr. Parker, Miss Stacy.

08:13.873 --> 08:15.792
A word.

08:16.751 --> 08:19.546
I wonder if you remember a field trip
we took last year...

08:19.754 --> 08:21.965
...to the laboratory
of Dr. Curtis Connors...

08:22.173 --> 08:24.634
...at Empire State University?

08:40.859 --> 08:43.653
Trust me, that's one field trip
I'll never forget.

08:43.861 --> 08:46.823
Me neither.
Dr. Connor's research was thrilling.

08:47.032 --> 08:48.366
I'm glad you feel that way.

08:48.575 --> 08:52.704
Because he's offering two internships
to promising high schoolers.

08:53.288 --> 08:55.457
I recommended my two star pupils.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.792
You start this afternoon.

09:10.555 --> 09:12.849
Thanks for letting me kill time
at your place.

09:14.017 --> 09:16.352
I'm not due at the ESU lab
for another hour.

09:16.561 --> 09:18.688
I'm surprised
you're not at the school paper.

09:18.897 --> 09:21.024
Aren't you their photographer
or something?

09:21.232 --> 09:22.275
Not anymore.

09:22.484 --> 09:25.111
Someone else can take pictures
of Flash prancing around.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.322
I'll be too busy raking in the green.

09:27.530 --> 09:30.825
Is this part of the same reality
where Sally Avril's your--

09:31.034 --> 09:32.702
A minor setback.

09:32.911 --> 09:35.872
But at least this lab job solves
the Parker money problems.

09:36.081 --> 09:40.168
I mean, look around. All this belongs
to your dad and he's a scientist.

09:40.376 --> 09:42.712
Boys, come out here.

09:44.881 --> 09:46.341
I couldn't help overhearing.

09:46.549 --> 09:50.011
- I'm sorry, Mr. Osborn, I--
- Don't you dare apologize, son.

09:50.220 --> 09:51.262
I never do.

09:51.471 --> 09:52.972
So, what's this about a lab job?

09:53.181 --> 09:55.016
At ESU, working with Curt Connors.

09:55.225 --> 09:58.186
Connors, huh? Quite an opportunity.

09:58.394 --> 10:01.898
Don't suppose you were considered
for the honor, Harry?

10:02.107 --> 10:03.441
No, sir.

10:03.775 --> 10:06.903
It's totally not a big deal, Mr. O,
but thanks.

10:07.112 --> 10:09.781
We'll get out of your way now.

10:11.407 --> 10:12.617
Osborn!

10:18.289 --> 10:19.749
Dad.

10:26.881 --> 10:28.383
What--? What do we do?

10:28.591 --> 10:30.385
Call the cops. Do it. Go!

10:41.229 --> 10:45.483
Tell the truth, Osborn.
Can your Tech-Flight do this?

10:49.696 --> 10:51.531
- Toomes?
- Not Toomes now.

10:51.739 --> 10:54.033
I'm what you called me.
I'm the Vulture.

10:54.242 --> 10:55.994
I called you a buzzard.

10:56.202 --> 10:58.413
- What?
- You can't even get the name right.

11:03.918 --> 11:06.546
Toomes, stop.
What will any of this accomplish?

11:06.754 --> 11:08.339
A means to an end, Osborn.

11:08.548 --> 11:10.675
Something you know all about.

11:10.884 --> 11:12.177
You will announce...

11:12.385 --> 11:15.013
...that Adrian Toomes
is the genius behind Tech-Flight.

11:15.221 --> 11:17.182
You will pay me all that I am owed.

11:17.390 --> 11:21.686
And you will publicly apologize
for stealing my invention.

11:21.895 --> 11:24.022
I never apologize, old man.

11:24.230 --> 11:25.523
I may be an old man...

11:25.732 --> 11:27.650
...but I'm not a patient one.

11:36.784 --> 11:40.079
Oh, guys.
You play hot potato hard-core.

11:40.747 --> 11:42.874
What is this?

11:43.082 --> 11:45.710
These skies are mine now!

11:45.919 --> 11:47.712
He may be right. I really just rent.

11:47.921 --> 11:50.215
What are you babbling about?
Put me down.

11:50.423 --> 11:54.344
Dude, you are the bossiest damsel
in distress I have ever rescued.

11:54.552 --> 11:57.847
Also the ugliest,
heaviest and the first.

11:58.056 --> 12:00.016
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

12:00.225 --> 12:03.061
Why, I'm your friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man, of course.

12:05.939 --> 12:07.065
Spider-Man?

12:07.273 --> 12:08.483
I thought you were a myth.

12:08.983 --> 12:11.694
Man, I need a new press agent.

12:18.076 --> 12:19.577
He's not helping, Stan.

12:19.786 --> 12:22.455
- The perps he nabs always walk--
- Heads up!

12:33.800 --> 12:37.428
- What's going on?
- Explanations inside. Now.

12:40.556 --> 12:41.599
Look,Beaky“.

12:41.808 --> 12:44.644
...I admire anyone who dresses up
as their favorite animal.

12:44.852 --> 12:46.354
Better still, you can fly.

12:46.562 --> 12:47.605
So I gotta ask...

12:47.814 --> 12:51.276
...you heard the one about great power
coming with great responsibility?

12:55.029 --> 12:57.323
Whoa, Beaky, don't fly away mad.

12:57.532 --> 13:00.660
The name is Vulture.

13:02.787 --> 13:03.830
That's great, Harry.

13:04.038 --> 13:06.040
I'm glad that your dad's safe.

13:06.249 --> 13:08.167
Me? Well...

13:08.376 --> 13:10.628
You know,
I tried to follow him on foot.

13:10.837 --> 13:12.880
I ran for blocks, but--

13:13.339 --> 13:15.842
Yeah, I guess
that was pretty useless.

13:16.342 --> 13:20.638
Hey, look, I'm late, and Gwen's
giving me the look. So goodbye.

13:20.847 --> 13:23.641
I so was not giving you the look.

13:23.850 --> 13:25.351
But I am late, right?

13:25.560 --> 13:26.894
Always, bro.

13:27.854 --> 13:29.355
- Eddie.
- Hey, Gwen.

13:29.564 --> 13:30.982
Bro, what are you doing here?

13:31.190 --> 13:33.484
Work here. I'm Connors'
personal lab assistant.

13:33.693 --> 13:35.069
Not bad for a frosh, huh?

13:36.070 --> 13:37.655
Eddie Brook's a freshman.

13:37.864 --> 13:39.324
College freshman, little man.

13:39.532 --> 13:41.326
I guess you miss me
at Midtown High.

13:41.534 --> 13:43.578
No one to keep Flash Thompson
off your back.

13:44.037 --> 13:46.039
Stole your shoes again, huh?

13:49.876 --> 13:53.338
Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, I'd like you
to meet Dr. Martha Connors.

13:53.588 --> 13:56.132
Eddie's told us great things
about you both.

13:56.341 --> 13:59.886
Said you wore clean underwear.
Lucky I didn't say socks.

14:01.220 --> 14:03.181
Curt, stop hiding in the office.

14:03.389 --> 14:05.058
New interns are here.

14:05.850 --> 14:06.893
I'll be right out.

14:07.226 --> 14:11.356
Peter, Gwen, this is ESU's
resident genius. My husband, Curt.

14:11.564 --> 14:13.941
It's an honor to meet you,
Dr. Connors.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.943
You look familiar, son.

14:16.402 --> 14:20.031
- Weren't you the boy that was bitten--?
- By the science bug. You know it.

14:20.239 --> 14:21.991
We won't overdo it the first day.

14:22.200 --> 14:25.328
Eddie'll show you around
but the real work can start tomorrow.

14:25.703 --> 14:27.121
So questions welcome.

14:27.330 --> 14:30.208
Here's one: What does this gig pay?

14:30.416 --> 14:33.252
Pete, you're a high school kid
with zero experience.

14:33.628 --> 14:36.214
You're not getting paid.

14:39.926 --> 14:42.929
Aunt May needs my help.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

14:43.429 --> 14:45.515
Oh, Pete, don't angst, okay?

14:45.723 --> 14:47.600
It'll come to you.

14:50.895 --> 14:53.856
Well, I'm waiting.

14:56.526 --> 15:00.113
You gotta admit,
the girl knows her stuff.

15:05.451 --> 15:07.745
<i>Today's been one-stop shopping
for disappointment.</i>

15:07.954 --> 15:10.581
<i>No money at home.
No cool at school.</i>

15:10.790 --> 15:13.584
<i>I nearly pavement splat fighting
a wacko with wings.</i>

15:13.793 --> 15:17.296
<i>And now Daily</i> Bugle <i>security
won't even let me use the elevator.</i>

15:17.505 --> 15:19.882
<i>But May and Ben Parker
didn't raise no quitters.</i>

15:20.091 --> 15:22.176
<i>Any quitters. You get the idea.</i>

15:27.390 --> 15:30.893
Robbie, where's my layout? Foswell,
I ordered that rewrite 12 seconds ago.

15:31.102 --> 15:33.813
Lee, I'm not paying you
to sit on your keister. And you.

15:34.021 --> 15:36.065
- Me?
- Yeah, you. I sent you for my bagel...

15:36.274 --> 15:37.775
...and schmeer nine minutes ago.

15:37.984 --> 15:40.820
You sent Benny,
and it's only been three minutes.

15:41.028 --> 15:43.698
Actually, sir, I've got something
better than a bagel.

15:43.906 --> 15:45.324
Oh, yeah? What's that?

15:45.533 --> 15:47.994
A proposal.
I think I can get you pictures.

15:48.202 --> 15:51.289
Photos of Spider-Man in action.

15:51.497 --> 15:52.999
I bet it would sell newspapers--

15:53.207 --> 15:55.793
What do you know about
selling papers? You're a kid.

15:56.002 --> 15:57.336
Worse, you're a teenager.

15:57.545 --> 15:58.963
Miss Brant, call security.

15:59.172 --> 16:02.467
Get this wailing infant out of my face,
out of my city room...

16:02.675 --> 16:04.677
...out of my town!

16:05.511 --> 16:08.306
Hey, what the <i>Bugle</i> needs is photos.

16:08.514 --> 16:10.433
Of Spider-Man. In action.

16:10.641 --> 16:12.560
Now, that'd sell newspapers, huh?

16:13.686 --> 16:15.730
<i>Today officially reeks.</i>

16:16.939 --> 16:18.649
<i>Not one thing's gone right.</i>

16:18.858 --> 16:21.110
<i>And now the Amazing Spider-Man...</i>

16:21.319 --> 16:24.238
...is <i>reduced to sneaking around
for his shoes.</i>

16:29.702 --> 16:30.953
All clear?

16:31.162 --> 16:33.164
Osborn!

16:34.207 --> 16:36.042
Go! GO!

16:36.751 --> 16:39.170
You won't escape me again.

16:39.378 --> 16:41.005
My thought exactly.

16:42.048 --> 16:44.217
Target sighted
at last known location.

16:44.550 --> 16:47.845
Boys, let's squash us a bug.

16:57.772 --> 16:59.899
Trick or treat.

17:01.859 --> 17:05.320
I mean, you are celebrating
Halloween in September, right?

17:05.613 --> 17:07.656
Or am I not one to talk?

17:17.250 --> 17:20.752
Strangest darn gig
Big Man's ever slid our way.

17:21.127 --> 17:24.173
We're flying with the freaks now,
boys.

17:24.382 --> 17:27.050
I got no idea
what that big bird's about...

17:27.260 --> 17:30.304
...but I am mighty glad
he's keeping our bug busy.

17:30.513 --> 17:32.265
Target locked.

17:33.057 --> 17:34.767
My Spider-Sense is ting--

17:48.781 --> 17:50.533
Ox, Fancy Dan. You're up.

17:58.541 --> 18:01.836
Look, pal, if you needed a breath mint,
you just had to ask.

18:23.983 --> 18:25.568
Oh, that's not good.

18:38.998 --> 18:42.293
Boys need a workout.
Now, no turning tail.

18:42.501 --> 18:44.295
Seriously, who are you guys?

18:47.381 --> 18:49.050
I think we lost him.

19:06.317 --> 19:08.861
It's not that I'm running,
but there's a Vulture-guy.

19:09.070 --> 19:11.447
So if we could just postpone--

19:11.739 --> 19:13.783
You're strong. Point taken.

19:14.241 --> 19:15.701
But can you do this?

19:17.203 --> 19:18.829
Didn't think so.

19:19.288 --> 19:22.375
Now, I know
you can tear right through that...

19:22.708 --> 19:24.502
...but I wouldn't recommend it.

19:24.710 --> 19:26.796
Son, you're making
the Enforcers look bad.

19:27.004 --> 19:28.464
I can't have that.

19:31.008 --> 19:33.886
- You will apologize.
- I won't.

19:35.721 --> 19:39.725
Man, this is a sweet ride.
That sunroof come standard?

19:39.934 --> 19:42.937
Why do you defend that thief
Osborn?

19:43.270 --> 19:46.482
Uncool. Do you know
what these Spider-suits cost?

19:49.068 --> 19:51.445
<i>Never fought anyone
like this group of bozos.</i>

19:54.031 --> 19:55.574
<i>Only one thing I know for sure.</i>

19:55.783 --> 19:59.453
<i>I can't let Harry lose his dad
the way I lost Uncle Ben.</i>

19:59.662 --> 20:01.706
Surf's up!

20:04.250 --> 20:07.086
There, the car park. Go! Go!

20:07.920 --> 20:09.296
No!

20:10.005 --> 20:11.966
This is all your fault.

20:19.181 --> 20:21.058
Two birds, one stone.

20:30.234 --> 20:32.194
Where'd that varmint get to now?

20:34.572 --> 20:37.575
Did you really think
you could hide from me there?

20:44.832 --> 20:47.251
My wing. I can't steer.

20:47.460 --> 20:48.961
Yeah, but you're still airborne.

20:49.170 --> 20:51.046
How does that work exactly?

20:51.255 --> 20:53.507
Vultchie, your hump's humming.

20:53.716 --> 20:54.759
You idiot.

20:54.967 --> 20:56.218
You've doomed us both.

20:56.969 --> 21:00.222
You so have not been
paying attention.

21:13.903 --> 21:15.821
<i>Well, three out of four ain't bad...</i>

21:16.030 --> 21:18.574
<i>...especially on bizarre
bad guy night.</i>

21:18.783 --> 21:22.495
<i>Now, if I can just get my shoes.</i>

21:26.707 --> 21:29.752
<i>Oh, perfect end to a perfect day.</i>

21:34.048 --> 21:36.091
Aunt May, you're awake.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.344
Sit down, Peter. We need to talk.

21:38.552 --> 21:43.140
I know you're a good boy and
growing up to be a fine young man.

21:43.349 --> 21:44.683
The man of the house now.

21:44.892 --> 21:46.977
But you're still my responsibility.

21:47.186 --> 21:49.188
I can't have you out till midnight.

21:49.396 --> 21:52.483
You're to be home by 10:00.
That's my bedtime.

21:52.691 --> 21:56.612
- But, Aunt May--
-if you're late, you call before 10.

21:56.821 --> 21:59.949
If you do call, it had better be
to say you're on your way home.

22:00.157 --> 22:02.284
That's the law in this house, Peter.

22:02.493 --> 22:04.578
Do we understand each other?

22:04.787 --> 22:06.455
Sure, Aunt May. That's fair.

22:06.956 --> 22:10.918
Lovely. Now, how about
a slice of banana cream pie?

22:11.126 --> 22:14.088
<i>Okay, nothing went as planned today.</i>

22:14.296 --> 22:15.923
<i>Understatement of the year.</i>

22:16.131 --> 22:17.883
<i>But I'm still Spider-Man.</i>

22:18.092 --> 22:20.052
<i>And still undefeated.</i>

22:20.261 --> 22:23.722
<i>And I still have this amazing person
watching out for</i> me.

22:23.931 --> 22:25.558
<i>Tell me there's something better.</i>

22:25.766 --> 22:26.809
<i>Go ahead.</i>

22:27.017 --> 22:28.477
<i>Try'</i>
