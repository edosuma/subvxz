12:30.450 --> 12:33.320
Can you please just--
just let me talk to Zoe?

12:33.353 --> 12:35.255
- She's not here right now.
- Well, then,

12:35.288 --> 12:36.389
give me her number.

12:38.491 --> 12:42.095
You don't get to decide this.
- It's not good for her.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.831
I have to go.
- Ali, please.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.332
I just miss you.
I miss you so much.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.367
Tell me where you are.
Please, just tell me.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.136
Where are you, honey?

12:49.169 --> 12:51.204
- [sniffs]

12:51.238 --> 12:54.107
I miss you too, Mom.
- Ali?

12:54.141 --> 12:56.076
Honey, wait, wait--

13:00.513 --> 13:03.483
[swanky jazz music]

13:03.516 --> 13:10.924
*

13:13.393 --> 13:18.231
- [softly] How you doing?
Almost done.

13:18.265 --> 13:21.134
You got a gorgeous coat on you.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.872
We're gonna do something
real nice with you.

13:24.905 --> 13:28.541
You'll be upstairs
in the main house too.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.011
That'll be nice, huh?

13:31.044 --> 13:33.881
So what do you think
you want to be?

13:33.914 --> 13:35.148
Drinking from a stream?

13:35.182 --> 13:38.018
We could put you
by the kitchen sink.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.386
Wanna do that?

13:39.419 --> 13:41.554
You're the only raccoon
in the house, dude.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.323
[knocking]

13:43.356 --> 13:45.558
- Hi.
- Yes?

13:45.592 --> 13:48.161
- Um...I just wanted
to talk to you quick

13:48.195 --> 13:51.164
about my sister.
- Sure.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.901
- So, as I said
over the phone--

13:53.934 --> 13:55.168
- You know,
just at first glance,

13:55.202 --> 13:57.170
I have to say,
she seemed normal.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.173
- Yeah, no, she is
when she's on her meds.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.574
But I also just wanted
to let you know

14:01.608 --> 14:04.444
as a little FYI,
she's also in recovery.

14:04.477 --> 14:07.114
So no drugs, no alcohol.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.316
So if you could just avoid
offering her a drink

14:09.349 --> 14:11.384
or anything,
that would be really great.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.420
- I usually drink alone.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.326
- And honestly, I...
you know, I took this job

14:19.359 --> 14:22.662
for her...you know,
it didn't even matter

14:22.695 --> 14:24.464
where it was.
We just needed a fresh start--

14:24.497 --> 14:26.133
- Yeah, well...

14:26.166 --> 14:29.069
I'm not your mom, okay?

14:29.102 --> 14:32.205
I'm not even your cool aunt.
I'm just the landlady.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.074
You give me
a check every month.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.209
I cash it.
That's it.

14:36.243 --> 14:41.381
I-I have no kids,
and that was by choice.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.985
- Got it.
Thanks.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.426
- Renters, huh?

14:55.996 --> 14:57.330
- First day.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.967
So you're gonna be meeting
Tanya Marcus

15:00.000 --> 15:02.269
and her daughter Isabelle,
okay?

15:02.302 --> 15:03.636
Izzy.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.238
CPS is going to be coming today

15:05.272 --> 15:08.641
and removing her from the home.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.111
- And we're gonna be there?

15:11.144 --> 15:14.647
- No one said this job was
"Chicken Soup for the Soul."

15:14.681 --> 15:16.116
- And Butcher's Block,

15:16.149 --> 15:18.251
that-that's the area
we're going to?

15:18.285 --> 15:19.987
- No, that's where we are.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.455
Shin Street, up here.
It's Butcher's.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.592
[fireworks crackling,
kids squealing]

15:25.625 --> 15:28.595
[low, eerie music]

15:28.628 --> 15:30.697
- "Peach's Meats."

15:30.730 --> 15:32.632
I've been seeing
that everywhere.

15:32.665 --> 15:36.036
- Yeah, the city was built
around meat-packing plants.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.670
Butcher's Block is where
the workers lived.

15:37.704 --> 15:41.008
There were run by this guy,
Joseph Peach.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.309
One day he disappeared

15:42.342 --> 15:45.178
and the whole operation
shut down.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.680
You know the term
"sacrifice zone"?

15:47.714 --> 15:49.316
- No.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.052
- It's an environmentally
used-up area,

15:52.085 --> 15:53.753
like a dead mine.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.088
No school programming,

15:55.122 --> 15:57.124
no mental health funding,

15:57.157 --> 15:59.359
no public works.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.362
It's...a socioeconomic
dead zone.

16:04.597 --> 16:08.001
- Cool street art, though.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.669
- Yeah, it has that.

16:09.702 --> 16:14.407
*

16:14.441 --> 16:16.743
Hey.

16:16.776 --> 16:19.746
Don't ever come down
here alone, okay?

16:19.779 --> 16:21.548
Or at night.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.555
[faint bestial snarling]

16:36.829 --> 16:39.632
Uh, let me do the talking,
okay?

16:39.666 --> 16:41.034
- Okay.

16:45.705 --> 16:49.109
[distant arguing]

16:57.650 --> 17:01.088
[dog barking in the distance]

17:01.121 --> 17:03.123
[knocking]

17:04.124 --> 17:06.126
- Ms. Marcus?

17:08.561 --> 17:10.330
Alice?

17:11.564 --> 17:12.532
[knocking]

17:12.565 --> 17:13.666
[door chain rattling]

17:13.700 --> 17:15.202
[dead bolt snaps]

17:16.736 --> 17:19.472
Hey.

17:19.506 --> 17:22.142
Ms. Marcus, uh, can we come in?

17:22.175 --> 17:23.510
Please?

17:26.579 --> 17:28.181
Thanks.

17:28.215 --> 17:31.351
Just... leave your shoes on.

17:35.722 --> 17:39.392
- This is bullshit.
I'd never harm my child.

17:39.426 --> 17:42.362
Izzy!
- Is it okay if I grab a chair?

17:45.432 --> 17:48.568
So when CPS gets here,
don't resist.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.838
Our job is to try and help you
get your daughter back.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.473
You can call us at any time.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.276
[clears throat]
I'm gonna give you, uh...

17:56.309 --> 17:59.179
Tanya's number, and, uh...

17:59.212 --> 18:00.380
if you can put it
into your phone.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.649
It's the number
to the landline.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.384
- Izzy!

18:05.752 --> 18:08.188
- Hey, Izzy.
- Hey.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.689
Tell them what you told
the people.

18:09.722 --> 18:10.890
How you got bit.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.392
- By playing in the park.
- Yeah.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.662
I told you, stay out of there!

18:15.695 --> 18:18.698
But kids, they fuck around,
they get hurt.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.273
- Thanks, Izzy.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.610
Look, we take no position
on what you did or didn't do.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.480
We're just trying to--
- On what I did or didn't do?

18:33.513 --> 18:38.251
I just told you.
She got bit by a dog.

18:38.285 --> 18:43.390
She made up a story about
this or that bit her...

18:43.423 --> 18:48.628
and they act like I did it?

18:48.661 --> 18:52.399
Nobody believes me.
- Let's just keep it calm.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.934
- I used to fall down
the stairs.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.671
When I was a kid, my sister,
she got all of the attention.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.407
So I used to throw myself
down the stairs

19:00.440 --> 19:02.542
to try and get some
attention for myself.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.678
Kids do fuck around.
They do get hurt.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.314
I believe you.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.653
- See?
She gets it.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.559
- Tanya?

19:19.592 --> 19:23.963
We have some, uh, forms
you need to fill out.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.266
- Yeah, whatever.

19:28.901 --> 19:32.539
- [sniffing]

19:48.255 --> 19:50.390
- So I have a few...
for you to sign...

19:50.423 --> 19:52.692
[faint rasping,
creaking behind wall]

19:52.725 --> 19:55.862
[Tanya and Nathan talking
indistinctly]

19:55.895 --> 19:57.864
[low, suspenseful music]

19:57.897 --> 20:00.633
*

20:00.667 --> 20:03.703
[faint footsteps]

20:15.047 --> 20:18.451
[object rattling]

20:19.819 --> 20:25.858
- [humming]

20:40.907 --> 20:42.809
- Hey.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.778
I'm Alice.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.951
"Smart mouth"?

20:51.984 --> 20:53.920
Is that your nickname?

20:53.953 --> 20:55.388
No?

20:55.422 --> 20:56.989
- I found this at the park.

20:57.023 --> 21:00.727
- You found it at the park.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.429
Oh.

21:02.462 --> 21:05.798
Where?
- On the playground.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.467
- On the playground.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.637
[faint rattling]

21:12.004 --> 21:15.408
[faint breathing]

21:19.045 --> 21:21.381
[faint clattering]

21:25.752 --> 21:30.323
- Sometimes when I get scared,
I hide in the park.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.492
- When I was little,

21:32.525 --> 21:35.428
I used to hide
when I was scared too.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.830
My mommy wasn't always nice.

21:37.864 --> 21:42.402
Where's your hiding place?
- By the lady tree.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.571
- The lady tree?
What's that?

21:44.604 --> 21:47.774
- It's a tree by the park.

21:47.807 --> 21:48.841
- Oh.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.747
- Will you make sure nothing
happens to me and my mom?

21:54.781 --> 21:56.916
- Yeah, of course.

21:58.951 --> 22:02.355
[faint rattling]

22:06.058 --> 22:09.028
[suspenseful music]

22:09.061 --> 22:16.469
*

22:20.640 --> 22:23.876
Hey, Nathan?
[object rattling]

22:23.910 --> 22:25.778
Nathan?

22:29.916 --> 22:34.086
[whispering] I think there's
something inside the wall.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.555
- What?

22:35.588 --> 22:39.526
- There's something
inside the wall.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.398
[object clanks softly]

22:45.432 --> 22:47.567
- It's probably a raccoon.

22:49.436 --> 22:51.103
[door slams,
lock clicks]

22:51.137 --> 22:54.106
- Hey, Izzy?
[doorknob rattling]

22:54.140 --> 22:56.443
Izzy?
Hey, Izzy.

22:56.476 --> 22:57.710
- Fuck!

22:57.744 --> 22:59.579
- It's locked?
- What's going on?

22:59.612 --> 23:01.448
- Hey, Izzy!
- Come on...

23:01.481 --> 23:02.682
- Open the...
[woman screaming]

23:02.715 --> 23:04.451
Oh, my God.
- [shouting] Mrs. Marcus?

23:04.484 --> 23:06.919
- Izzy?
- Mrs. Marcus?

23:06.953 --> 23:08.521
- Nathan, open the door.

23:08.555 --> 23:11.824
Nathan, open the door!
- [grunts]

23:11.858 --> 23:14.494
- Open it!

23:14.527 --> 23:15.795
Izzy?

23:15.828 --> 23:18.798
[gripping music]

23:18.831 --> 23:21.934
*

23:32.879 --> 23:34.681
[pounding on door]
- Police! Open up!

23:34.714 --> 23:36.483
- [gasps]

23:36.516 --> 23:39.486
[panting]

23:39.519 --> 23:42.822
[indistinct,
overlapping voices]

23:46.559 --> 23:49.729
[indistinct whispering]

24:06.212 --> 24:08.615
[inhales deeply]

24:12.552 --> 24:14.587
- Afternoon.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.598
It's Zoe, right?

24:26.866 --> 24:30.069
- [grunts]
Mind if I smoke?

24:30.102 --> 24:32.505
- Sure.

24:32.539 --> 24:35.007
- Here.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.776
[lighter flicks]

24:42.749 --> 24:47.019
You, uh...
gonna let me hit that?

24:47.053 --> 24:50.690
- You know, your sister told me
that you were clean.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.894
- Yeah, I don't like
to stress her out.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.663
- Huh.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.798
Okay, fair enough.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.835
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

25:08.941 --> 25:13.312
- So that doesn't
trigger your...

25:13.345 --> 25:16.215
Never mind.
None of my business.

25:16.248 --> 25:17.650
- [scoffs]

25:19.586 --> 25:21.688
Of course she told you.

25:23.823 --> 25:26.926
You know, it's funny because,
like, most of my life,

25:26.959 --> 25:31.798
my brain was this, like,
perfect red little apple.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.666
I mean, I would say I was like,
I was pretty smart.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.068
But, um...

25:36.102 --> 25:40.206
it's-it's actually
when I turned 26 that...

25:40.239 --> 25:43.743
uh, it was like this...

25:43.776 --> 25:45.978
just like--like, a thing.

25:48.247 --> 25:51.217
It had been hibernating.

25:51.250 --> 25:54.086
[soft, eerie music]

25:54.120 --> 25:59.592
And it woke up,
and, um, it-it started to...

25:59.626 --> 26:04.631
slowly eat its way
towards the surface.

26:04.664 --> 26:08.735
They call it, um,
an "insidious onset."

26:11.871 --> 26:15.608
[stammering] It's, um...

26:19.211 --> 26:21.881
It's the beginning
of the end of you.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.922
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

26:29.956 --> 26:32.859
- So you just--
you don't believe us?

26:32.892 --> 26:34.293
- We don't think you're lying.

26:34.326 --> 26:37.196
We just think that
you're lacking in experience.

26:37.229 --> 26:39.932
- Okay, someone took them.

26:39.966 --> 26:42.334
- An hour before CPS arrives
to remove the kid?

26:42.368 --> 26:43.736
Think about it.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.337
- Okay, you didn't
hear her scream.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.807
- Okay, okay.
Um...

26:47.840 --> 26:49.809
was she the only one screaming,
or...

26:49.842 --> 26:52.211
- Is your name Vancyk, as in...

26:52.244 --> 26:55.147
- Yeah.
He's my dad.

26:55.181 --> 26:56.683
- Oh.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.417
- Look, I'm really sorry
to break it to you,

26:58.450 --> 27:00.687
but when Mom knows CPS
is arriving,

27:00.720 --> 27:03.823
sometimes...they just ghost.

27:03.856 --> 27:05.424
- And that's all
you have to say?

27:05.457 --> 27:08.728
What happened to protecting
and serving the community?

27:08.761 --> 27:10.229
- Community? [scoffs]

27:10.262 --> 27:12.732
More like persistent infection.

27:12.765 --> 27:15.735
[indistinct chatter
on police scanner]

27:15.768 --> 27:17.369
- We'll let you know
if they turn up, okay?

27:17.403 --> 27:18.838
Does that sound good?

27:18.871 --> 27:20.239
- What, do you guys have
somewhere to be?

27:20.272 --> 27:22.775
- He's gotta feed his dog.
- [scoffs]

27:22.809 --> 27:24.977
- Seriously.
His dog's deaf.

27:25.011 --> 27:28.214
You gotta stomp on the ground
so he can feel the vibration.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.782
- It's true.
Just...

27:29.816 --> 27:32.151
[feet stomping]
So sad.

27:32.184 --> 27:33.720
Hey, take care, okay?

27:33.753 --> 27:35.722
Have a good day.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.123
- Hey, let's go by Tony's.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.992
I want a quesadilla.
- Yeah, well...

27:40.026 --> 27:42.862
I don't.
- Well, I do.

27:42.895 --> 27:44.463
- Uh-uh.
I'm driving.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.767
Get rid of that, please.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.770
[thunder crackling distantly]

[crickets chirping]

27:55.174 --> 27:56.208
- Hey.

27:59.145 --> 28:00.847
Where are you?

28:03.115 --> 28:05.718
- Sorry, I just...

28:05.752 --> 28:08.821
can't stop thinking
about earlier.

28:08.855 --> 28:12.124
- Maybe the cops were right.

28:12.158 --> 28:13.726
- Yeah, but...

28:13.760 --> 28:17.063
you didn't hear
that woman screaming.

28:17.096 --> 28:23.803
Something happened to them,
and...nobody cares.

28:23.836 --> 28:25.437
- You do.

28:25.471 --> 28:27.039
- People don't sound like that

28:27.073 --> 28:29.441
unless something awful
is happening.

28:29.475 --> 28:32.044
- So what made them scream?

28:32.078 --> 28:34.981
- Not "them."
It was only the mom.

28:36.816 --> 28:40.152
- What is it, Alice?

28:40.186 --> 28:42.755
- The little girl,
she said that she hides

28:42.789 --> 28:46.258
when she's scared,
and what if she's still there?

28:46.292 --> 28:50.029

[anticipatory music]

28:56.168 --> 29:03.175

29:05.544 --> 29:08.180

anyone's around.

29:22.061 --> 29:24.196
- Hey, hey!
Welcome to the neighborhood!

29:24.230 --> 29:27.233
Hi.
I-I found some scissors.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.968
[chuckles]

29:29.001 --> 29:32.972
I cut off my bandages.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.975
- Oh, my God.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.844
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:37.877 --> 29:42.114
Why have they...
restrained you like that?

29:45.952 --> 29:49.221
I could...I could cut you free.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.593
I could.
I will.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.928
- No!

Mom?

Mom?

- Izzy?

31:00.092 --> 31:02.294
Zoe? I'll be right back.

I have to check something
outside real quick.

Izzy.

- Are you lost or something?

33:51.263 --> 33:52.764
- Who are you?

33:52.798 --> 33:55.234
- Joseph.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.702
What's your name?

33:56.735 --> 33:59.538
- What are you doing out here?

33:59.571 --> 34:00.706
- I'm taking a walk.

34:00.739 --> 34:02.641
- You're just taking a walk
in the middle of the night

34:02.674 --> 34:04.243
in Medallion Park?

34:04.276 --> 34:07.279
- I've lived here
for a very long time.

34:07.313 --> 34:09.815
We used to own this place.

34:09.848 --> 34:15.554
I like to listen to the birds
before the sun comes up.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.457
- You owned the park?

34:18.490 --> 34:21.260
- My family did.

34:21.293 --> 34:24.496
I travel the world and...

34:24.530 --> 34:27.866
this is the city
I come home to.

34:27.899 --> 34:31.103
When I walk here,
I...I'm in two worlds

34:31.137 --> 34:32.438
at the same time:

34:32.471 --> 34:36.275
the one you see
and the one I remember.

[animal squeaks

That's an owl.

[squeaking]

34:44.183 --> 34:48.120
He lives close to where
my house once was.

34:48.154 --> 34:51.557
It's a playground now.

Hi.

[both breathing raggedly]

Are you okay?
What happened?

Come on, let's go.
Let's get out.

38:08.587 --> 38:11.757
Zoe, what happened out there?

38:18.564 --> 38:21.533
- I saw something.
I don't even...

38:21.567 --> 38:22.934
- Zoe--
- I don't know if it's...

38:22.968 --> 38:26.638
if it's inside,
or...if it's outside my head,

38:26.672 --> 38:28.540
or...no, I don't know.
Maybe it's--

38:28.574 --> 38:29.741
you know, maybe it's both.

38:29.775 --> 38:31.977
I just--I-I need to
get out of here.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.412
[stammers]

38:33.445 --> 38:34.680
- How long have you been
using again?

38:34.713 --> 38:35.914
- Since those meds
stopped working.

38:35.947 --> 38:38.717
But this is different.

38:38.750 --> 38:42.087
We-we need to get
far away from here.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.989
[whispering] Far.
- And go where?

38:44.022 --> 38:46.425
Back home?
- Yes, home.

38:46.458 --> 38:47.993
- Do you seriously think
that that's healthy?

38:48.026 --> 38:50.629
- What are you so scared of?
- I'm not going back there.

38:50.662 --> 38:53.432
Zoe, I am not living back
at that house again!

38:53.465 --> 38:55.401
- I get it!

38:55.434 --> 38:57.135
[quietly]
I get it.

38:57.168 --> 39:00.906
You're the same age I was.

You're the same age Mom was.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.743
- That is not
what this is about.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.380

39:08.414 --> 39:10.549
that you're gonna become me,
isn't it?

39:12.984 --> 39:15.387

39:15.421 --> 39:18.089
- Well, guess what, Alice?

39:18.123 --> 39:21.493
There's nothing you can do
about it.

39:21.527 --> 39:25.697
It's either a part of you
or it's not.

39:25.731 --> 39:30.536
And if you can't just-just-just
come to terms with that...

39:30.569 --> 39:32.871
it's gonna eat you alive.

39:35.741 --> 39:39.911

You need me.

Um...

Maybe-maybe you need me.

39:54.693 --> 39:56.728
- It's not gonna happen to me.

39:57.963 --> 40:00.198
'Cause it's not just genetic.
It's environmental.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.934
And I don't do the things
that you do.

40:10.208 --> 40:11.843
- I'll take the bus.

I'm sorry if we were loud.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.696
She's gonna be back.

40:30.729 --> 40:33.699
- So long as
somebody pays the rent.

40:38.236 --> 40:41.072
- So what is all this, anyway?

40:41.106 --> 40:42.708
- It's my book...

40:42.741 --> 40:45.944
about what happens
in Butcher's Block.

40:45.977 --> 40:48.046
- What does happen
in Butcher's Block?

40:48.079 --> 40:50.081
- People go missing.

[apprehensive piano music]

40:56.254 --> 40:58.757
- And is that your brother?
The one that you wrote about?

40:58.790 --> 41:00.792
- Yeah, I always thought, uh...

41:00.826 --> 41:02.861
you know, he got into
some abandoned house and died

41:02.894 --> 41:06.031
and that's why we never
found his body, and then...

41:06.064 --> 41:08.834
I found out there were
a lot of others like him...

41:08.867 --> 41:13.539
[low rumbling]
Who wouldn't be missed.

that someone's...doing this?

41:29.988 --> 41:31.757
- Yes.

41:31.790 --> 41:34.693
Not one somebody.

41:34.726 --> 41:37.863
Could be one family.

41:37.896 --> 41:40.298
- Well, I guess that
this would be the city for it.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.000
You know?
Peach's Meats.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.636

42:02.220 --> 42:06.592

Those are the Peaches.

42:06.625 --> 42:09.895
In 1952, they all disappeared,

42:09.928 --> 42:16.668
except I think some of them
are still hanging around.

42:16.702 --> 42:19.671
- Still hanging around
doing what?

42:19.705 --> 42:22.207
- Killing.

42:22.240 --> 42:25.010
It would've begun
with the founder.

42:25.043 --> 42:30.616
He was a recluse...
fundamentalist religious nut.

- I used to sing
in a choir in this church...

42:42.928 --> 42:45.997
when I was very young.
Then my voice changed.

42:46.031 --> 42:48.667
They kicked me out.
The bastards.

42:48.700 --> 42:51.770
[man speaking faintly]

42:51.803 --> 42:53.639
- Who's that?

42:53.672 --> 42:57.909
- That's him.
Joseph Peach.

42:57.943 --> 43:04.149
He would be almost 130, though,
today, if he were still alive.

43:07.285 --> 43:10.088

where the bus will take us?

43:10.121 --> 43:12.190

Uh...Zoe.
