12:50.479 --> 12:52.773
This is a whole different
kind of climbing.

12:52.856 --> 12:55.776
'Cause on Everest, you can hire Sherpas
to carry all your stuff...

to fix the ropes for you,
to take most of the risks.

Everest four or five times.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.950

13:03.033 --> 13:05.119
But Meru is the anti-Everest.

13:05.202 --> 13:07.037
No one's gonna carry your stuff.

13:07.121 --> 13:09.707
If you need it, you need
to carry it on your back.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.418
And for Meru, you need
a lot of tools to do the job.

13:12.501 --> 13:15.212
Because the climbing covers
the whole spectrum.

13:16.380 --> 13:19.967
This upper 1,500 feet,
the Shark's Fin, is smooth.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.845
It's clean. It's nearly featureless.

13:22.928 --> 13:27.599
But below that is 4,000 feet of really
gnarly climbing- this fluted snow.

13:27.683 --> 13:29.184
Dangerous, exposed.

13:30.936 --> 13:35.065
So, time after time, guys would do that
first 4,000 feet, light and fast...

13:35.149 --> 13:36.859
thinkin' they're really studs.

13:36.942 --> 13:39.320
And then they get to the Fin,
and it's a big wall.

13:39.403 --> 13:42.197
And you gotta use big wall
techniques on the upper part of Meru.

13:42.281 --> 13:44.658
And you gotta go slow
for that kind of climbing.

13:44.742 --> 13:47.244
Maybe you'll only do 200 feet in a day.

13:47.328 --> 13:50.539
Maybe it's gonna take you six or seven
days to do that top 1,500 feet.

13:50.622 --> 13:53.862
And if it's gonna take you that long, if
you're going slow, you need a portaledge.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.378
You need food and water and fuel.

13:56.462 --> 13:59.006
Pretty soon, that's, like,
200 pounds of stuff.

13:59.089 --> 14:01.842
You need a big wall rack,
50 pounds of iron.

14:01.925 --> 14:06.347
So you gotta get that 200 pounds of crap
up the first 4,000 feet.

he'd found the perfect mentor.

And Mugs would take him into his van
and lift the prayer flag...

24:08.156 --> 24:11.451
and there's his special goal,
which is this peak called Meru.

24:11.534 --> 24:13.203
And Conrad was like, "Ooh."

24:14.496 --> 24:17.874
And Mugs tried it twice-
I think in '86 and '88.

24:17.958 --> 24:20.669
Failed both times,
for all kinds of reasons.

24:20.752 --> 24:25.131
But to Mugs, this didn't deter him.
This was- He is the cosmic climber...

24:25.215 --> 24:28.301
and this is all part of the cosmic plan,
and he was gonna go back.

That made a huge impression on him.

after I met Conrad...

<font color="#808080">CONRAD:</font> After the death of Mugs in '92...

56:48.656 --> 56:51.701
Alex Lowe became my main climbing partner.

56:51.784 --> 56:55.121
Alex was the premier climber at that time.

56:56.247 --> 57:00.752
Conrad was Alex's favorite partner...

57:00.835 --> 57:02.962
and best friend.

57:03.046 --> 57:06.382
Conrad was just right for him...

57:06.466 --> 57:09.260
because he could match Alex's pace.

57:09.344 --> 57:12.472
And there wasn't too many people
who could do that.

57:12.555 --> 57:15.475
This is Nirvana, what this is.

57:15.558 --> 57:19.979
So we're gonna hang out,
just enjoy the mountains.

57:20.063 --> 57:21.606
<font color="#808080">KRAKAUER:</font> You know,
Mugs was the mentor...

57:21.689 --> 57:24.943
but Alex was much more
Conrad's equal.

57:25.026 --> 57:28.780
These are, you know,
two of the most brilliant climbers ever.

57:28.863 --> 57:30.865
I mean, people were blown away by 'em.

57:30.949 --> 57:32.951
And they fed off each other!

57:34.202 --> 57:36.663
They were this perfect match,
the perfect partnership.

57:36.746 --> 57:40.541
I went to Antarctica with
both Alex and Conrad in '97...

57:40.625 --> 57:43.544
in one of the best trips I've ever done,
and they were in rare form.

57:43.628 --> 57:45.338
Just brilliant to behold.

57:45.421 --> 57:48.466
So he had this new partner,
and they were gonna tear up the world.

57:52.720 --> 57:56.140
<font color="#808080">CONRAD:</font> Alex did a remarkable job
of balancing family.

57:56.224 --> 57:58.810
We were all sort of vagabonds.

57:58.893 --> 58:02.730
And here's Alex. He's, like, legit.
He's married, and he's got kids.

58:07.402 --> 58:10.989
I was married to Alex Lowe for 18 years.

58:11.072 --> 58:16.035
And, um, in the autumn of 1999...

58:16.119 --> 58:19.497
uh, he was on an expedition with Conrad.

58:19.580 --> 58:22.709
It was to Shishapangma, in Tibet.

58:22.792 --> 58:26.295
And, uh, they went up
to take a look at the mountain.

58:28.381 --> 58:30.675
<font color="#808080">CONRAD:</font> It was supposed to be a rest day.

58:30.758 --> 58:35.346
David Bridges, Alex and I
went up, getting ready to do the climb...

58:35.430 --> 58:41.102
and we got to this point-
it was probably 7:30, 8:00 in the morning.

58:41.185 --> 58:45.148
All of a sudden, there was, like, this crack,
and we looked up and it was, "Oh, shit."

58:45.231 --> 58:47.025
There was a- a release.

I had this weird premonition.

58:53.156 --> 58:55.450
I didn't want him to go on the climb.

58:55.533 --> 58:57.452
I said, you know...

58:57.535 --> 59:00.788
"I'm worried that
you're gonna die in an avalanche."

59:00.872 --> 59:05.251

59:07.545 --> 59:12.216
<font color="#808080">CONRAD:</font> Alex and David ran straight
downhill. I traversed at an angle.

59:12.300 --> 59:15.803
I was like, "I'm gonna lay down
before the avalanche hits."

59:15.887 --> 59:21.017
And as I looked over, David and Alex were
still upright, and they were still running.

59:21.100 --> 59:24.395
I was picked up and thrown,
battered, tumbled.

59:24.479 --> 59:27.565
And just kind of half-buried.

59:27.648 --> 59:31.277
And then... it was silent.

59:34.906 --> 59:36.908
I remember standing up
and walking around...

59:36.991 --> 59:41.746
and going over to where I had seen them,
and there was nothing there.

59:41.829 --> 59:47.251
There was no ski stick or a glove sticking
out of the snow or anything like that.

59:47.335 --> 59:49.837
Our other teammates came up
to help with the search...

59:49.921 --> 59:54.675
and we searched there
for the better part of the day.

59:54.759 --> 59:58.096
I went back down to camp.
I needed some medical attention.

01:00:01.057 --> 01:00:04.477
<font color="#808080">JENNI:</font> I got the phone call.
I thought it was Alex at first.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.272
And Andrew's voice came on,
and I instantly panicked.

01:00:08.356 --> 01:00:11.734
Andrew's like, "Jenni,
there's been an avalanche."

01:00:11.818 --> 01:00:14.529
You know, and then my heart was racing.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:19.283
Right away, I said, "Is Conrad there?"

01:00:19.367 --> 01:00:21.994
Because, you know, I thought that...

01:00:22.078 --> 01:00:25.581
somehow Conrad would've protected Alex.

01:00:25.665 --> 01:00:29.210
You know, that it couldn't happen to him
if Conrad was there with him.

01:00:31.295 --> 01:00:34.340
I remember Jenni saying,
"Is there anything else you can do?

01:00:34.423 --> 01:00:39.637
Can you go back and look for him?"
And we're like, "No. It's just- He's gone."

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:43.432
And it was- it was-

01:00:43.516 --> 01:00:46.394
There was, um-
There was just this finality of it.

01:00:49.605 --> 01:00:53.818
<font color="#808080">KRAKAUER:</font> After Alex died,
Conrad went through this transformation.

01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:55.653
He was just- He looked gaunt.

01:00:55.736 --> 01:01:01.075
He was- He had retreated somewhere deep
inside and wasn't comin' out.

01:01:01.159 --> 01:01:04.412
I worried he was over the edge
and wasn't coming back.

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:09.375

the wheels were coming off.

01:01:09.458 --> 01:01:14.005
And, um, I didn't know
why I was so fucked up.

01:01:14.088 --> 01:01:18.217
Gil Roberts, a friend of mine,
who was in a very similar situation.

01:01:18.301 --> 01:01:20.678
He was there when
his climbing partner died.

01:01:20.761 --> 01:01:24.348
And more than once, he picked up
the phone, and he's like, "Hey, man.

01:01:24.432 --> 01:01:26.517
I've gotta come talk to you.
We've gotta get together."

01:01:26.601 --> 01:01:29.562
And I didn't know why
Gil wanted to get ahold of me.

01:01:29.645 --> 01:01:32.440
And it was, like-

01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:36.819
I remember his line.
He's like, "Yep. Survivor's guilt is a bear."

01:01:36.903 --> 01:01:39.363
And having to do that. And it was, like-

01:01:39.447 --> 01:01:42.366
Because for me, it's, like,
this heavy fucking thing...

01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:44.785
that wouldn't leave me alone.

01:01:44.869 --> 01:01:47.038
'Cause Alex had it going on.

01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:50.625
Here he was, he was successful.
He had three kids, a happy married life.

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:54.629

over Alex's death...

to being with Jenni...

01:02:18.486 --> 01:02:21.447

us knew what was happening...

01:02:46.847 --> 01:02:48.766

He needs the mountains to climb, but
it's like, "Am I taking too many chances?

01:03:34.562 --> 01:03:37.732

Of course you can't control the risk.
