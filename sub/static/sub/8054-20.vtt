WEBVTT

00:01.968 --> 00:03.468
- Good morning.
- Whoo!

00:03.536 --> 00:06.637
Swiss family ron-binson-
that hat is dope.

00:06.705 --> 00:08.271
Thanks, tom.

00:08.339 --> 00:11.141
You mind if I rock that
bad larry on my dome?

00:11.208 --> 00:12.523
Wear it, on my head?

00:12.591 --> 00:15.437
Try it on the ladies?

00:15.505 --> 00:16.669
Be my guest.

00:16.736 --> 00:21.235
Hi. I'm tom.
I have a raccoon on my head.

00:21.303 --> 00:22.670
Uh...

00:22.737 --> 00:24.937
Excuse me, my friend over here
was digging through your trash,

00:25.005 --> 00:26.205
And I think we may
have a lot in common.

00:26.273 --> 00:28.508
I'm tom. Would you like
to see a movie sometime?

00:28.576 --> 00:31.039
Are you a raccoon?

00:31.107 --> 00:33.737
Because you've been running
around my hat all da--

00:33.805 --> 00:35.773
Head all day.

00:35.840 --> 00:37.809
Girl, you're more
precious than precious.

00:37.877 --> 00:39.445
Uh-uh.

00:39.512 --> 00:42.080
Nice hat. Want to bone?

00:42.148 --> 00:43.682
That's you talking to me.

00:43.750 --> 00:44.916
No.

00:44.984 --> 00:47.084
How about...

00:47.152 --> 00:50.620
"yes, I am a hunter,
and it's you season"?

00:50.687 --> 00:52.121
Whoa!

00:52.189 --> 00:54.223
That's great.
I got to get back out there.

00:54.290 --> 00:55.323
You know what they say--

00:55.391 --> 00:57.024
Animal on the head,

00:57.092 --> 00:58.192
Manimal in the bed.

00:58.260 --> 01:00.360
Damn, girl, your hotness
killed my raccoon.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.763
I have a raccoon hat.
I'm an interesting person.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.865
Hello.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.466
Any luck?

01:07.534 --> 01:08.700
No.

01:08.768 --> 01:10.202
Didn't work out as well
as I thought it would.

01:10.269 --> 01:12.803
Well, better luck next time.

01:12.871 --> 01:14.371
I tried. It just
didn't seem like--

01:14.439 --> 01:15.706
Wow, I love that hat.

01:15.773 --> 01:17.540
Thank you, ma'am.

01:20.777 --> 01:23.680
[triumphant music]

01:23.750 --> 01:33.792

<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:40.838 --> 01:43.008
Hey, ron,
I have a surprise for you.

01:43.076 --> 01:45.243
Meet me at harvey
james park at 11:30.

01:45.311 --> 01:47.111
- Why?
- It's a surprise.

01:47.179 --> 01:48.411
What's the surprise?

01:48.479 --> 01:49.879
If I told you,
it would ruin the surprise.

01:49.947 --> 01:51.214
What's the surprise
it would ruin?

01:51.282 --> 01:52.215
I cannot tell you that.

01:52.283 --> 01:53.750
Leslie, my first wife, tammy,

01:53.818 --> 01:55.818
Tried throwing me a
surprise birthday party.

01:55.886 --> 01:58.087
When I saw my friends
hiding through the window,

01:58.155 --> 02:00.022
I drove to a gas station,
called the cops,

02:00.090 --> 02:02.224
And told them people had
broken into my home.

02:02.292 --> 02:04.760
Not big on surprises.

02:04.827 --> 02:06.294
Okay, but you're
gonna like this one.

02:06.362 --> 02:07.629
- What is it?
- I'm not telling you.

02:07.696 --> 02:11.698
And I'm not gonna tell anybody.

02:11.766 --> 02:12.866
Okay, I'll tell you.

02:12.933 --> 02:13.866
We're putting together

02:13.934 --> 02:15.767
The parks department
summer catalog,

02:15.835 --> 02:19.637
And the big surprise is
I am going to reunite

02:19.705 --> 02:23.040
All the living, former parks
directors at a picnic,

02:23.108 --> 02:24.241
Record the whole thing,

02:24.309 --> 02:27.043
And then write about it
in the welcome letter.

02:27.111 --> 02:29.311
It's the biggest
catalog of the year.

02:29.379 --> 02:32.047
<i>Think of the September
issue of vogue,</i>

02:32.115 --> 02:33.948
But it's more important to pawnee,

02:34.016 --> 02:36.049
<i>Mainly because we don't
get vogue here.</i>

02:36.116 --> 02:39.584
I'm gonna move this yearning
ad to the centerfold.

02:39.651 --> 02:41.518
Centerfold? Always the best part.

02:41.586 --> 02:43.152
Am I right, justin?

02:43.220 --> 02:45.220
Damn. You broke up six weeks ago.

02:45.288 --> 02:47.555
Yeah. Jerry, I need to
see your softball pictures.

02:47.623 --> 02:49.423
Here you go, chief.

02:49.491 --> 02:51.358
Wow. Good job. Nice work.

02:51.425 --> 02:53.691
Wait a minute.
Isn't that that creepy guy?

02:53.759 --> 02:56.594
Morgan, the pedophile?

02:56.661 --> 02:57.795
Yeah, it is.

02:57.863 --> 02:59.230
[all groaning]

02:59.298 --> 03:01.566
Come on, I didn't know that.
He seemed okay.

03:01.633 --> 03:02.767
[gasps]

03:02.834 --> 03:04.301
We had dinner together.

03:04.369 --> 03:05.702
Guys, I don't know
if I made it clear,

03:05.770 --> 03:07.203
But I don't want any sex offenders

03:07.271 --> 03:08.771
In our parks catalog.

03:08.838 --> 03:10.239
Okay, I will photoshop his face.

03:10.307 --> 03:12.508
Can you photoshop your life
with better decisions, jerry?

03:12.576 --> 03:13.676
Okay, April, enough.

03:13.743 --> 03:15.510
Cover photo-- tom, you're up.

03:15.578 --> 03:16.812
This catalog

03:16.880 --> 03:18.680
Is basically like an ad
for the parks department,

03:18.748 --> 03:20.682
And I love ads.

03:20.750 --> 03:23.184
I love magazine ads
for flavored vodkas,

03:23.252 --> 03:25.086
Billboards for designer jeans.

03:25.153 --> 03:27.655
I tivo through shows
to get to the ads.

03:27.722 --> 03:29.856
I love ads.

03:29.924 --> 03:32.324
What are we trying to
do with this catalog?

03:32.391 --> 03:35.126
We're trying to sell pawnee
on our summer classes.

03:35.194 --> 03:36.361
How do we do that?

03:36.429 --> 03:39.531
With one perfect,
captivating image.

03:39.599 --> 03:40.765
April.

03:40.833 --> 03:42.200
Modern life.

03:42.267 --> 03:43.767
Where are we running?

03:43.835 --> 03:47.538
Sometimes what we want is
not always where we are.

03:47.605 --> 03:48.972
Next slide.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.540
Are we alone?

03:50.608 --> 03:53.176
Is the real winter
inside our hearts?

03:53.244 --> 03:55.545
We're all struggling for definition

03:55.613 --> 03:57.614
In a world that
resists our inquiries.

03:57.681 --> 03:59.482
Okay, this isn't gonna
work for a number of reasons.

03:59.549 --> 04:00.983
One-- this is a summer catalog,

04:01.050 --> 04:03.351
Two--that was complete gibberish,

04:03.419 --> 04:05.486
And three--that child
looks like it's abandoned,

04:05.553 --> 04:07.987
So basically, boo.

04:08.055 --> 04:10.356
Next slide.

04:10.424 --> 04:11.690
Oh, god.

04:11.758 --> 04:14.026
Weird. How did that...?

04:14.093 --> 04:15.994
Um, that's a personal photo.

04:16.062 --> 04:17.894
That's--

04:17.963 --> 04:19.397
Shouldn't be-- it must've...

04:19.464 --> 04:20.665
You know, I got to say,

04:20.732 --> 04:23.233
I think that could actually
work as our cover photo.

04:23.301 --> 04:24.468
I'm cool with it if you guys are.

04:24.535 --> 04:25.669
It's a high-res photo.

04:25.736 --> 04:27.170
I don't know if I have
time for this, guys,

04:27.237 --> 04:28.504
So let's just pick
a good photo, okay?

04:28.572 --> 04:29.739
What do you want, leslie?

04:29.807 --> 04:31.240
A picture of parents
pushing a kid on a swing?

04:31.308 --> 04:33.342
Yeah, exactly. Get me that.

04:33.410 --> 04:34.743
[sighs]

04:34.811 --> 04:36.644
Okay, I got to go.

04:36.712 --> 04:39.680
What is he thinking?

04:39.747 --> 04:42.515
"why is my cup so tiny?"

04:42.583 --> 04:44.851
[knocking]

04:44.918 --> 04:47.620
Hey. What are you doing here?

04:47.688 --> 04:49.955
Happy six-month anniversary.

04:50.022 --> 04:51.489
I got you a gift.

04:51.557 --> 04:53.024
Uh, it's a chicken-salad sandwich.

04:53.092 --> 04:55.693
And I don't want you to feel bad
about not getting me anything,

04:55.761 --> 04:56.827
Because I never exp--

04:56.895 --> 04:59.196
Swiss army watch, mofo.

04:59.264 --> 05:01.731
Well done, perkins.

05:01.799 --> 05:03.333
Wow. - You like it?

05:03.400 --> 05:06.969
Thank you so much. It's so nice.

05:07.037 --> 05:08.470
Are you-- are you
allowed to kiss me

05:08.538 --> 05:09.971
In a--in a hospital room?

05:10.039 --> 05:11.940
Oh, don't worry about it.
He's dead.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.341
Oh, my god.

05:13.409 --> 05:15.209
Oh, no, I'm just kidding.
He's sleeping.

05:15.277 --> 05:16.277
Oh, okay.

05:16.345 --> 05:18.278
Yeah, our relationship
is going well,

05:18.346 --> 05:20.313
Really well.

05:20.381 --> 05:22.948
That guy really seemed dead.

05:25.049 --> 05:26.951
Nice!

05:27.019 --> 05:28.553
Here, catch this.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.453
[laughs]

05:30.521 --> 05:31.987
You got me in the face.

05:32.055 --> 05:33.888
Oh. That one hurt.

05:33.955 --> 05:35.155
You have a good arm.

05:35.223 --> 05:36.823
I know. I used to play
softball in high school.

05:36.891 --> 05:38.525
Shut up. I played
baseball in high school.

05:38.592 --> 05:39.892
Shut up.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.694
Yeah, that's, like,
the boy version of softball.

05:41.761 --> 05:43.228
Guys, don't play
with the food, okay?

05:43.295 --> 05:44.395
We need this for the picnic.

05:44.463 --> 05:45.730
We have everything? - Yes, ma'am.

05:45.798 --> 05:47.899
Three picnic baskets,
assorted cheeses, grapes, wine.

05:47.967 --> 05:50.268
Smoked salmon?

05:50.335 --> 05:53.570
April threw the smoked
salmon on the roof.

05:53.638 --> 05:54.904
I'm sorry.

05:54.972 --> 05:56.171
Where's leslie?

05:56.239 --> 05:57.839
She just texted me from your phone

05:57.907 --> 05:59.307
And said she left her phone at home

05:59.375 --> 06:01.142
And that I should
come here immediately,

06:01.210 --> 06:02.776
And why did I believe that?

06:02.843 --> 06:04.777
Maybe in your heart,
you knew it was from me,

06:04.845 --> 06:06.412
But you came anyway.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.613
Nope.

06:07.681 --> 06:09.714
Tom, would you
please stop texting me

06:09.781 --> 06:11.515
That you're having a
city-planning emergency.

06:11.583 --> 06:13.451
There's no such thing as a
city-planning emergency.

06:13.518 --> 06:14.452
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

06:14.519 --> 06:15.553
Look at you two.

06:15.620 --> 06:18.121
Ann perkins, mark brendanawicz.

06:18.189 --> 06:19.689
Ann-danawicz...

06:19.757 --> 06:21.457
Or merkins.

06:21.525 --> 06:22.925
No, ann-danawicz.

06:22.993 --> 06:24.160
You two should be models--

06:24.227 --> 06:25.661
Maybe on the cover

06:25.729 --> 06:28.630
Of the parks department
summer catalog?

06:28.698 --> 06:31.032
That's not the reason you
called me in here, right?

06:31.100 --> 06:32.633
'cause I just finished
a 12-hour shift.

06:32.701 --> 06:33.868
If that's the reason--

06:33.936 --> 06:35.637
Come on, ann. It'd be
a huge favor for leslie.

06:35.705 --> 06:37.039
You know how important
this is to her.

06:37.107 --> 06:38.307
- Well, I am in.
- Dude.

06:38.375 --> 06:39.308
I am.

06:39.376 --> 06:41.443
We don't have any pictures

06:41.511 --> 06:43.145
Of just the two of us.

06:43.213 --> 06:44.646
Plus, I've always said

06:44.714 --> 06:46.648
We should go on
more dates with tom.

06:46.716 --> 06:48.283
Yeah, you have,

06:48.351 --> 06:50.319
And thank god an opportunity
presented itself.

06:50.386 --> 06:51.520
See, win-win.

06:51.588 --> 06:52.856
Now, ann, you're
gonna change, right?

06:52.923 --> 06:54.457
I g--I guess.

06:54.525 --> 06:56.691
And would it kill you to
maybe put on some lipstick?

06:56.758 --> 06:57.991
Do you even own lipstick?

06:58.058 --> 06:59.926
This is probably the
first time in history

06:59.993 --> 07:02.060
These four great men have
been in the same place

07:02.128 --> 07:03.095
At the same time.

07:03.162 --> 07:04.830
It kind of makes you--

07:06.232 --> 07:07.165
What is this?

07:07.233 --> 07:08.266
[laughing]

07:08.334 --> 07:10.134
Sweater swap. She noticed.
You were right.

07:10.202 --> 07:11.335
Oh, my god. Somebody's here.

07:11.403 --> 07:12.869
Okay, guys,
just act normal, please.

07:12.937 --> 07:14.070
Just be like normal people.

07:14.138 --> 07:16.272
Hello. Hi, david moser.

07:16.340 --> 07:17.273
I'm leslie knope.

07:17.340 --> 07:18.707
It is such an honor to meet you.

07:18.775 --> 07:21.610
Right. How long
is this gonna take?

07:21.678 --> 07:23.044
Oh, not very long.

07:23.112 --> 07:25.446
I-I realize, of course,
you're a very busy man.

07:25.514 --> 07:27.047
I love parks.

07:27.115 --> 07:29.283
I don't know if that's something
I've communicated before.

07:29.350 --> 07:30.684
So having a picnic

07:30.752 --> 07:33.654
With all the former,
living parks department directors--

07:33.721 --> 07:36.555
Guess who just checked
something off her bucket list.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.857
Clarence carrington, david moser,

07:38.925 --> 07:41.293
Michael tansley, ron swanson--

07:41.360 --> 07:43.328
Gathered together
on a beautiful day

07:43.396 --> 07:44.695
In this beautiful park.

07:44.763 --> 07:46.163
I think we should
just take a moment

07:46.230 --> 07:48.830
And appreciate how lucky we are.

07:48.898 --> 07:50.565
I thought you were dead,
clarence.

07:50.633 --> 07:53.967
No, I'm gonna outlive you,
then I'm gonna nail your wife.

07:54.035 --> 07:55.068
Screw you, you old coot.

07:55.136 --> 07:57.070
Classic david.
You're worse than ron.

07:57.138 --> 07:58.871
Shut your damn mouth, tansley.

07:58.939 --> 08:01.574
Okay, great, let's go.

08:01.642 --> 08:03.944
When I say "parks,
" you say "department."

08:04.011 --> 08:05.579
Parks.

08:05.646 --> 08:06.747
Parks.

08:06.814 --> 08:08.048
Apartment!

08:10.039 --> 08:12.473
Oh, boy, this is taking a lot
longer than I thought it would.

08:13.041 --> 08:14.808
Can you guys run up ahead
and set up the picnic?

08:14.876 --> 08:16.643
Sure. [leslie sighs]

08:16.711 --> 08:18.211
Where are they
going with the food?

08:18.279 --> 08:20.480
I'm starving.
I only had one breakfast.

08:20.548 --> 08:21.615
Okay, relax.

08:21.683 --> 08:23.216
Look, what was going on back there?

08:23.284 --> 08:24.451
Why all the sniping?

08:24.519 --> 08:25.952
I'm not exactly sure.

08:26.020 --> 08:27.252
The only one I know is michael,

08:27.320 --> 08:29.220
And we're not exactly best friends.

08:29.288 --> 08:30.722
I'm hungry.

08:30.789 --> 08:32.591
Okay, well, don't be such a baby.

08:32.659 --> 08:34.994
I cooked you some bacon
for a trail snack.

08:35.061 --> 08:36.328
I ate it already.

08:36.395 --> 08:37.328
What?

08:37.395 --> 08:38.530
I could smell it in your purse

08:38.597 --> 08:39.597
Before I even parked my car.

08:39.664 --> 08:40.631
And now it's gone,

08:40.698 --> 08:43.134
And I hate everything.

08:45.003 --> 08:46.603
Good, good, good.

08:46.671 --> 08:48.038
All right.

08:48.106 --> 08:50.941
I think we got the boring,
cliched shot that leslie wanted.

08:51.009 --> 08:52.008
That's it? We're done?

08:52.076 --> 08:53.742
Not even close.

08:53.810 --> 08:57.178
Now the real art begins.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.612
Step one-- nail this photo shoot

08:59.680 --> 09:01.747
With an amazing, iconic image.

09:01.815 --> 09:03.649
Step two-- book some outside gigs.

09:03.717 --> 09:06.118
Step three-- have sex with a model.

09:06.186 --> 09:09.956
Step four--step in front of
the camera, become a model.

09:11.892 --> 09:14.126
Go, yes. Keep slithering,
keep slithering!

09:15.695 --> 09:18.529
Ann, can you give me something,
anything in the face?

09:18.597 --> 09:19.763
What do you want me to do?

09:19.831 --> 09:21.398
Do what mark's doing.
He's doing great.

09:21.466 --> 09:22.466
Keep slithering!

09:22.534 --> 09:25.470
I'm not doing anything, so...

09:25.538 --> 09:28.273
Okay, clarence, um,
why don't you describe

09:28.340 --> 09:30.541
The first summer pawnee catalog?

09:30.609 --> 09:32.509
Oh, I remember.

09:32.577 --> 09:35.445
That first year,
we offered four classes.

09:35.513 --> 09:37.313
I actually taught homemaking.

09:37.381 --> 09:40.082
Women were not allowed
to teach back then.

09:40.150 --> 09:41.450
Really?

09:41.518 --> 09:43.184
I thought there were female
teachers way before then.

09:43.252 --> 09:46.486
Not  my department.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.721
Well, times have changed.

09:48.788 --> 09:51.156
I'm--I'm deputy director now,
but I'm hoping someday

09:51.224 --> 09:53.792
To be the first female
director of the department.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.361
Oh, I don't think
that's a good idea.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.163
Women, uh, need a lot of blood

09:58.231 --> 10:01.432
To--to flow through to-
-to the baby cents,

10:01.500 --> 10:04.968
Which leaves less to
the brain, you see.

10:05.036 --> 10:06.769
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Sure.

10:06.837 --> 10:09.071
I'd stay away from
leadership roles,

10:09.138 --> 10:13.173
Uh, for your own safety.

10:13.240 --> 10:14.407
No! No!

10:14.474 --> 10:15.741
[groans]

10:15.809 --> 10:17.510
Hey, maybe I should write
a song about a picnic.

10:17.577 --> 10:20.446
Ooh, where'd you
come up with that idea?

10:20.513 --> 10:21.847
The picnic we're having.

10:21.915 --> 10:24.316
I already have the perfect title.

10:24.384 --> 10:25.617
"life is a picnic."

10:25.685 --> 10:26.985
That's good.

10:27.053 --> 10:30.855
How about "life is a
picnic...With you"?

10:30.922 --> 10:33.721
Whoa. Then it could
be about a girl...

10:33.788 --> 10:35.755
Or peyton manning.

10:35.822 --> 10:38.022
Hmm. You want to help
me write thlyrics?

10:38.089 --> 10:40.557
Yeah, totally.

10:40.624 --> 10:43.793
We should grab a drink
after this at tucker's.

10:43.861 --> 10:46.194
Yeah, I would do that.
That sounds fun.

10:46.262 --> 10:48.797
I just have to, um,
get my stuff from the office.

10:48.864 --> 10:52.433
But that's-- that would be cool

10:52.501 --> 10:53.867
David, what was it exactly

10:53.935 --> 10:55.936
That called you to
the parks department?

10:56.004 --> 10:58.170
Well, I was in public
works for eight years,

10:58.238 --> 10:59.905
But the director was pretty young.

10:59.973 --> 11:03.075
Clarence was old and weak,

11:03.142 --> 11:05.143
So I put in for a transfer,
swooped ,

11:05.211 --> 11:07.379
And pushed him out.

11:09.381 --> 11:11.816
Uh, there was no other
reason you wanted the job?

11:11.884 --> 11:14.619
No, just the money
and the pension.

11:14.687 --> 11:17.253
The actual job's a nightmare.

11:17.321 --> 11:20.856
I mean, who gives a
crap about thisrap?

11:20.924 --> 11:23.060
[blows nose]

11:23.128 --> 11:24.763
[chuckles]

11:24.831 --> 11:27.566
Well, david,
I think we've talked enough.

11:27.633 --> 11:30.135
Mark, that's great. Bobby, great.

11:30.202 --> 11:31.502
Ann, you look miserable!

11:31.570 --> 11:33.270
Terrible, terrible!

11:33.337 --> 11:35.305
Come on, ann, what are we doing?

11:35.372 --> 11:36.973
<i>Maxim or good housekeeping?</i>

11:37.040 --> 11:39.041
I'm not sure which
one is the insult.

11:39.109 --> 11:40.176
Hey, if there's anyone out there

11:40.243 --> 11:41.443
That's doing a photo shoot

11:41.511 --> 11:43.012
About the dangers of
eating undercooked chicken,

11:43.079 --> 11:45.280
I can give you ann's phone number.

11:45.348 --> 11:47.216
Okay, let's stop for a second.

11:47.283 --> 11:49.217
Bobby, I love how you work.

11:49.285 --> 11:50.384
Yay.

11:50.452 --> 11:51.919
You can have as many
juice boxes as you want.

11:51.987 --> 11:54.088
In fact, grab me one too.
Make it an apple.

11:54.156 --> 11:57.591
Mark, great job.
You can have a juice box too.

11:57.659 --> 11:59.626
Ann, take a walk with me.

11:59.694 --> 12:01.128
In a million years, I never thought

12:01.195 --> 12:03.263
You would be the problem
with this photo shoot.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.732
Didn't you just plan this,
like, two hours ago?

12:05.799 --> 12:07.400
I just don't get it.

12:07.467 --> 12:09.902
How could someone so hot
be so bad at looking hot?

12:09.969 --> 12:12.169
I'm sorry I'm not a
professional model.

12:12.237 --> 12:14.971
And screaming "make your
face better" doesn't help.

12:15.039 --> 12:17.140
Well, I'm sorry.
Your face just isn't working.

12:17.207 --> 12:18.173
And we need to do mething

12:18.241 --> 12:20.107
To distract from this ring area.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.173
Now, I didn't want
to have to do this,

12:21.241 --> 12:22.474
But we may have to go nude.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.476
- Good-bye, tom.
- Fair enough.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.578
I totally understand,
but we should get one for safety.

12:26.645 --> 12:28.312
Okay, guys, we're almost there.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.480
It's right up here.

12:29.548 --> 12:30.982
You really shouldn't
be leading us.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.985
If you're menstruating,
you'll attract bears.

12:34.053 --> 12:35.487
Holy god.

12:35.554 --> 12:36.654
Okay.

12:36.722 --> 12:38.823
Here we are. - [breathing heavily]

12:38.891 --> 12:40.992
Eat.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.827
Well, it hasn't gone
exactly as I'd hoped,

12:42.895 --> 12:45.329
But, um, I got them all here,

12:45.397 --> 12:46.997
And we're gonna have
a beautiful picnic.

12:47.065 --> 12:48.665
It's gonna-- it's gonna be good.

12:48.733 --> 12:50.500
Hey!

12:50.568 --> 12:53.169
I just whizzed on a butterfly.

12:56.241 --> 12:58.509
Well, gentlemen, as you know,
I'm working on my welcome letter

12:58.577 --> 13:00.144
For the summer catalog.

13:00.211 --> 13:01.778
You should just
copy the eagleton one.

13:01.846 --> 13:03.446
I used to just copy
the eagleton one.

13:03.514 --> 13:04.880
Did you?

13:04.948 --> 13:06.782
I was hoping that maybe you
could talk to me a little bit

13:06.849 --> 13:08.950
About how the department has
changed since you ran it.

13:09.018 --> 13:10.786
Well, I think you've
done a wonderful job

13:10.853 --> 13:12.387
Maintaining the parks.

13:12.455 --> 13:13.788
Thank you, michael.
I appreciate that.

13:13.856 --> 13:15.322
Did you enjoy your
turn at the helm?

13:15.390 --> 13:16.490
Oh, in a way.

13:16.558 --> 13:17.959
Um, pencil-pushing
wasn't really my thing,

13:18.026 --> 13:19.627
But I did love the
parks themselves.

13:19.695 --> 13:21.394
That was the best part of the job.

13:21.462 --> 13:22.628
Oh, isn't it? I totally agree.

13:22.696 --> 13:24.796
Well, thank goodness
for you. [laughs]

13:24.864 --> 13:27.465
Yes, thank goodness for michael.

13:27.533 --> 13:29.201
Are you still on parole,
by the way?

13:29.268 --> 13:31.971
Oh, ha ha, very funny, ron.

13:32.038 --> 13:33.839
- Y-y-yes, ron, I am.
- What?

13:33.907 --> 13:35.806
He smoked pot in the office

13:35.874 --> 13:37.974
And in all the parks constantly.

13:38.042 --> 13:39.975
In fairness to me,
it was a different time.

13:40.043 --> 13:43.212
It was the early '90s,
but also it's ridiculous

13:43.279 --> 13:44.713
That marijuana is illegal.

13:44.781 --> 13:47.515
Thomas jefferson grew hemp.

13:47.583 --> 13:50.650
Alcohol is legal, but pot isn't?

13:50.718 --> 13:51.851
[scoffs]

13:51.919 --> 13:53.251
That makes sense to you, ron?

13:53.319 --> 13:55.086
I'm sorry. I can't hear hippies.

13:55.154 --> 13:56.187
[chuckles]

13:56.255 --> 13:57.588
[light laughter]

13:57.656 --> 13:59.424
So if you had to sleep
with one of the old guys,

13:59.492 --> 14:00.925
Who would it be?

14:00.993 --> 14:02.260
The super old one.

14:02.328 --> 14:03.695
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

14:03.762 --> 14:05.930
I'm an eyebrow girl.

14:05.998 --> 14:08.065
I want to make out with him
and chew his eyebrows off.

14:08.133 --> 14:10.268
[laughing] that is...

14:10.336 --> 14:11.836
Really gross.

14:11.904 --> 14:13.572
Anybody got any water?

14:13.639 --> 14:15.607
[mockingly] "oh,
I want water. I'm so old.

14:15.674 --> 14:17.108
I need to drink water.
" - oh, stop it.

14:17.175 --> 14:18.875
Stop taunting him.

14:18.943 --> 14:20.576
I don't need your help, jailbird.

14:20.644 --> 14:22.778
If there's any
unclaimed meat or cheese,

14:22.845 --> 14:24.245
I would like to claim it.

14:24.313 --> 14:25.580
Yeah, like you claimed my job?

14:25.648 --> 14:26.715
Yes, exactly like that,

14:26.782 --> 14:28.249
In that I wanted it,
and then I took it.

14:28.317 --> 14:29.617
Okay, guys,
you know what I would love?

14:29.685 --> 14:31.954
I'd love if anybody just
said something positive

14:32.022 --> 14:34.057
About--oh, I don't know-- anything.

14:34.125 --> 14:36.127
I agree. Let's just relax,
smoke another "j,"

14:36.195 --> 14:37.695
And all calm down.

14:37.763 --> 14:39.063
Another?

14:39.131 --> 14:41.298
By the way, it's ridiculous
that pot is illegal.

14:41.366 --> 14:43.933
- Oh.
- It grows...

14:44.001 --> 14:45.168
In the ground.

14:45.236 --> 14:47.137
I've planted marijuana
in community gardens

14:47.204 --> 14:49.237
All over the city,
and it hasn't hurt anyone.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.638
- What?
- You know, michael,

14:50.706 --> 14:51.906
You are one pot-loving [bleep]

14:51.974 --> 14:53.941
Mother[bleep] pain in the rectum.

14:54.009 --> 14:55.241
Okay, stop it. Stop it.

14:55.309 --> 14:57.142
You're all being awful,
horrible men.

14:57.210 --> 14:58.143
Uh-oh.

14:58.210 --> 15:00.077
Your little friend come to visit?

15:00.145 --> 15:01.078
[laughing]

15:01.145 --> 15:02.745
Clarence, if you mention

15:02.813 --> 15:05.879
Anything about women
or menstruation

15:05.946 --> 15:07.912
<i>Or anything, I'm gonna
take your face,</i>

15:07.980 --> 15:09.613
And I'm gonna shove
it in those brambles.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.147
- Yes.
- No, you're next, buddy.

15:11.214 --> 15:13.148
Andy! Let's take this picture.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.583
Come on, get out of
your seat, turds.

15:14.650 --> 15:15.884
- What?
- Line up over there.

15:15.952 --> 15:17.987
Come on. Just please
try to look human,

15:18.054 --> 15:19.755
All right, and not so evil.

15:19.823 --> 15:20.890
Everybody, looky here.

15:20.957 --> 15:22.624
One, two, three-- thank you so much

15:22.692 --> 15:23.659
For the wonderful memories.

15:23.726 --> 15:24.960
Everybody take their stuff and go.

15:25.027 --> 15:28.296
Ooh, ooh, can we do
one funny-face one?

15:29.690 --> 15:30.757
Do you have that
picture that andy took?

15:30.824 --> 15:32.057
Maybe I'll run it without any text.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.491
Yeah.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.559
I tried to photoshop it to make
it look like they were happy.

15:36.627 --> 15:39.227
It was really hard.
Their mouths are just so old.

15:39.295 --> 15:41.461
God, look at these horrible men.

15:41.528 --> 15:44.129
You know, I don't even know
if I want them in my catalog.

15:44.197 --> 15:45.496
Would you like...

15:45.564 --> 15:46.931
These men in your catalog?

15:46.999 --> 15:48.999
Oh, my god, April.
That's disgusting.

15:49.067 --> 15:51.401
What? Look how generous
they're being with each other.

15:51.468 --> 15:53.002
And here's the
obstruction series.

15:53.070 --> 15:55.173
What do you think? Amazing, right?

15:55.240 --> 15:57.442
I call this one "the future."

15:57.510 --> 15:59.778
It's completely blurry.

15:59.846 --> 16:03.582
Yes, it is, ann.

16:03.649 --> 16:05.950
What about the ones we took
on the swing--the normal ones?

16:06.018 --> 16:09.854
You mean the
"unhappy wife" photos?

16:09.921 --> 16:12.455
Oh, my god. These are
even worse somehow.

16:12.523 --> 16:14.558
I look miserable.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.259
You do look kind of miserable.

16:16.327 --> 16:18.295
Now you know what I meant by,
"make your face better."

16:18.362 --> 16:20.329
Was there something wrong,
ann? I--

16:20.397 --> 16:23.165
Well, I'd just gotten
off a long shift.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.867
He was being really annoying.

16:24.935 --> 16:25.901
Mark looks happy.

16:25.969 --> 16:27.069
Ugh. Just--

16:27.137 --> 16:29.404
Please don't use these, okay?

16:29.471 --> 16:30.971
Let's grab some dinner.

16:31.039 --> 16:34.406
Sure.

16:34.473 --> 16:36.174
Hey, ron, you want me to read you

16:36.241 --> 16:37.741
What I have so far
in my welcome letter?

16:37.809 --> 16:38.876
Nothing...

16:38.943 --> 16:40.544
Because you and your
jerk predecessors

16:40.611 --> 16:42.578
Didn't give me
anything to work with.

16:42.646 --> 16:44.147
Did you...

16:44.214 --> 16:45.314
Print this out?

16:45.382 --> 16:47.316
I heard the printer going. - Yes.

16:47.384 --> 16:49.486
You could've just handed
me a blank piece of paper.

16:49.554 --> 16:51.556
Oh, wisdom-- finally.

16:51.623 --> 16:52.891
Thank you so much.

16:52.958 --> 16:56.160
You can also keep the photo.
Thanks for the memories.

16:56.228 --> 16:57.194
Good god.

16:57.262 --> 16:58.328
I don't remember this.

16:58.396 --> 17:00.163
That-- that's the wrong one.

17:00.231 --> 17:02.364
But the real one's
very bad as well.

17:02.432 --> 17:04.031
I want you to know
that I'm replacing

17:04.099 --> 17:05.500
The welcome letter with this ad

17:05.568 --> 17:07.202
For yearning by dennis feinstein.

17:07.269 --> 17:10.169
So good-bye, distilled wisdom
of 50 years of experience.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.270
Hello, disgusting fragrance flap.

17:12.338 --> 17:14.771
- Let me buy you dinner.
- No.

17:14.839 --> 17:16.872
I insist you buy me dinner.

17:16.940 --> 17:19.508
Get a drink or whatever.
It's cool.

17:19.576 --> 17:20.843
- I.D.?
- I'm 24.

17:20.911 --> 17:22.845
No, you're not.

17:22.913 --> 17:25.949
- Okay, I'm 25-
- no old jokes, please.

17:26.017 --> 17:27.017
I.D.

17:28.753 --> 17:30.386
[muttering]

17:34.757 --> 17:36.124
It says right here you're 20.

17:36.191 --> 17:37.524
Seriously?

17:37.592 --> 17:40.293
You're not even gonna
show me a fake?

17:40.362 --> 17:43.532
Sometimes the confidence
confuses people.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.634
- You're good, bro.
- You know what?

17:45.701 --> 17:46.968
I think I'll just--

17:47.036 --> 17:48.303
I'm gonna-- - um, hey...

17:48.371 --> 17:51.139
Um, I know another bar that
always lets--lets me in,

17:51.207 --> 17:53.374
If you just want to go there,

17:53.442 --> 17:55.809
If you want to go do that.
Uh, yeah, actually...

17:55.877 --> 17:56.876
I should be going home.

17:56.944 --> 17:58.643
I got a lot of stuff to do,

17:58.711 --> 18:00.010
So I should go home...

18:00.078 --> 18:02.645
Clean and stuff.

18:02.713 --> 18:04.313
But...

18:04.381 --> 18:07.149
Yeah, okay, cool.
Yeah, I got to...

18:07.217 --> 18:08.917
Go home too, so...

18:08.985 --> 18:10.985
All right.

18:11.053 --> 18:12.920
See ya.

18:12.988 --> 18:15.389
Later.

18:17.225 --> 18:18.925
The usual, marta.

18:18.993 --> 18:20.059
Me too, marta.

18:20.127 --> 18:22.194
- You got it.
- [sighing] oh, ron...

18:22.262 --> 18:24.530
I really made love to
the pooch on this one.

18:24.597 --> 18:26.098
Screwed the pooch?

18:26.166 --> 18:28.166
I don't like that term.
It's so vulgar.

18:28.234 --> 18:29.500
[inhales sharply]

18:29.568 --> 18:32.169
[groaning] ron.

18:32.237 --> 18:35.105
That sucked today. I'm sorry.
There's no other way to say it.

18:35.173 --> 18:37.508
They're a bunch of
career bureaucrats.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.609
What did you think they
were gonna say to you?

18:39.677 --> 18:41.778
"leslie, you are the next
link in a wonderful chain

18:41.846 --> 18:43.613
"that stretches back to
when our town was founded.

18:43.681 --> 18:45.281
"and we believe in you,
and we support you,

18:45.349 --> 18:47.116
"and we'll be
following your career.

18:47.184 --> 18:48.351
You are the chosen one."

18:48.419 --> 18:50.086
Or something.

18:50.154 --> 18:52.121
Well, okay,
so that was the problem.

18:52.189 --> 18:53.623
No, you know what
the worst part is,

18:53.691 --> 18:55.625
Is I want to be parks director,

18:55.693 --> 18:58.428
But every single person who was
parks director hated their job

18:58.496 --> 19:00.630
And hated everyone
they worked with.

19:00.698 --> 19:03.133
[sighs]

19:03.200 --> 19:05.201
Are we gonna hate
each other someday?

19:05.269 --> 19:07.806
- I don't think so.
- Huh.

19:07.873 --> 19:09.776
I think we're gonna be fine.

19:09.844 --> 19:12.479
Anyway, the point's moot,

19:12.546 --> 19:13.980
Because you're park director now,

19:14.048 --> 19:15.315
And you're not going anywhere,

19:15.383 --> 19:17.150
And I'm not making you go anywhere.

19:17.218 --> 19:19.487
I'm not gonna stab you in
the back or anything, so...

19:19.554 --> 19:20.821
Maybe I should go somewhere.

19:20.889 --> 19:23.491
Maybe I should move to eagleton.

19:23.559 --> 19:25.160
Oh, god, the thought of that.

19:25.228 --> 19:27.895
Leslie, you don't have
to move to eagleton.

19:27.963 --> 19:29.897
When I become city manager,

19:29.965 --> 19:31.365
My job is yours.

19:32.835 --> 19:34.836
Of course, my first
act as city manager

19:34.904 --> 19:37.840
Will be to propose eliminating
the parks department,

19:37.908 --> 19:40.679
Although I expect a
spirited debate with leslie.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.016
Who knows what the
future holds for me?

19:43.083 --> 19:47.020
Maybe I'll leapfrog ron's
job and become city manager.

19:47.088 --> 19:49.023
Of course, my first
act as city manager

19:49.090 --> 19:51.859
Would be to double the size
of the parks department,

19:51.927 --> 19:56.030
Although I do expect
a fight from ron.

19:56.098 --> 19:57.665
But I'll win.

19:57.733 --> 20:00.034
Mmm, oh! Thank you, darling.

20:00.102 --> 20:01.336
Oh, why would anybody

20:01.404 --> 20:03.137
Ever eat anything
besides breakfast food?

20:03.205 --> 20:06.103
People are idiots, leslie.

20:08.772 --> 20:11.139
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

20:11.206 --> 20:13.906
- The wait is over.
- Oh, yay!

20:13.974 --> 20:16.276
Yay! Look what's here.

20:16.343 --> 20:18.011
What we got...

20:18.078 --> 20:19.512
"my fellow pawneeans,

20:19.580 --> 20:21.047
"yes, it's here.

20:21.114 --> 20:23.982
"the parks department's
summer catalog has arrived.

20:24.050 --> 20:26.784
"and for the first time in 20 years,
tennis is back.

20:26.852 --> 20:29.386
"peruse this wondrous
book at your leisure

20:29.454 --> 20:30.621
"and take advantage

20:30.689 --> 20:32.723
"of everything this
great town has to offer.

20:32.790 --> 20:35.725
"time is fleeting,
my fellow pawneeans.

20:35.793 --> 20:39.061
"make the most of it while you can.

20:39.129 --> 20:41.163
"I recently had the honor
of spending an afternoon

20:41.230 --> 20:43.996
"with every living,
former parks director,

20:44.063 --> 20:46.495
"and they taught me
a valuable lesson--

20:46.562 --> 20:49.195
There's nothing more
important than friendship."

20:50.896 --> 20:52.129
It's a little flowery.

20:52.196 --> 20:53.229
Shut up.

20:54.847 --> 20:56.347
I got to hand it to michael.

20:56.414 --> 21:00.382
His water-pipe-making
skills were most impressive.

21:00.449 --> 21:01.849
I once saw him smoke pot

21:01.917 --> 21:05.115
Out of a 20-foot length of
garden hose and a milk jug.

21:05.119 --> 21:08.520
That guy made a water pipe
out of a stuffed raccoon.

21:08.588 --> 21:09.755
- No way.
- No, I'm not kidding.

21:09.822 --> 21:11.389
He made a bong out of
a taxidermied raccoon?

21:11.456 --> 21:13.390
I caught him
smoking pot out of it

21:13.458 --> 21:15.892
Not three feet from
where we're standing.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.060
[thunk] - oh, nice shot!

21:18.128 --> 21:21.562
Right in clarence's ancient junk.

21:21.630 --> 21:23.430
- Oh!
- Oh!

21:23.498 --> 21:24.063
In the neck!

21:24.064 --> 21:25.064
