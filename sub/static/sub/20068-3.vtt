But after a good start, their
next ten lines have come up

15:56.856 --> 15:58.823
next ten lines have come up
empty.

16:01.927 --> 16:05.630
 Jay Paul's put up the money for
this trip, and if things don't

disappointment.

16:45.237 --> 16:48.573
If the Molineres' luck doesn't
change soon...

16:50.809 --> 16:55.480
...their trip to Creole Bayou
could be a huge setback.

16:58.283 --> 17:00.518
Back in Bayou Sorrel...

...it's Willie Edwards' first
day as the solo captain of his

at work.

17:15.300 --> 17:20.003
As he sets a fresh line, he
hears a familiar sound.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.973
hears a familiar sound.
(baby gator squeaking)

17:25.109 --> 17:29.047
It's a distress call.
(baby gator squeaking)

17:29.049 --> 17:30.448
(baby gator squeaking)
And Willie follows the gator

17:30.450 --> 17:32.417
And Willie follows the gator

It's a nest of baby gators,
and they're in bad shape.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.278
The nest has been abandoned.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.715
So Willie decides to help out.

18:16.462 --> 18:20.965
For Willie, saving these baby
gators isn't just a good deed...

18:25.037 --> 18:27.405
...it's also about respecting
 the swamp that provides for his

18:27.407 --> 18:29.340
 the swamp that provides for his
family.

18:43.555 --> 18:46.791
 Willie knows he may cross paths
with these gators one day in the

Over in Raceland...

are headed across a marsh that

19:14.854 --> 19:16.787

no one dares to travel.

19:25.631 --> 19:29.800
 To access the other side of Mr.
 Jimmy's land, they have to pass

 Jimmy's land, they have to pass
through a treacherous area

19:31.070 --> 19:33.237
through a treacherous area
called Hunter's Narrow.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.584
The water is dangerously
shallow.

19:52.658 --> 19:56.127
If the boys get stuck, they
might not be getting out.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.484
>> NARRATOR: They've invested
too much in this hunting trip to

20:20.486 --> 20:23.387

give up now, so Jeromy and David
decide to go for it.

(motor starts)

20:32.231 --> 20:35.132
(laughing, whooping)

20:54.753 --> 20:57.722
 They've got to keep their speed
up, or risk getting stuck in the

thick fog.

When I'm turning, the boat
didn't want to turn, and we

 Jeromy and David do not want to
 spend the night in this hostile

22:26.846 --> 22:28.779
 spend the night in this hostile
swamp.

22:34.753 --> 22:37.621
Getting the boat free is a must.

22:41.660 --> 22:44.962
(strained grunting)
Using brute force...

Jeromy and David finally get
through Hunter's Narrow...

23:12.924 --> 23:15.292
 ...and they like what they see.

 The day is ticking away, so the
boys get cracking, hanging lines

as fast as they can.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.000
 to the rendezvous point to meet
their supply boat.

After running all of their
 lines, they've only snagged six

gators-- barely worth a thousand

24:05.144 --> 24:06.310
gators-- barely worth a thousand
dollars.

dollars.
Their investment in hunting this

24:07.680 --> 24:10.214
Their investment in hunting this
 isolated area isn't paying off.

 I took it in my own hands to go
out and get this, and, uh...

24:34.539 --> 24:37.741
>> NARRATOR: And now they've got
a bigger problem.

24:41.580 --> 24:44.482

 But their cousin Dylan, who was
supposed to be back with ice and

24:52.792 --> 24:55.125
supposed to be back with ice and
fuel, hasn't shown up.

25:09.641 --> 25:13.544

Holden sees a good sign.

The line's caught in the thick
swamp grass.

34:56.893 --> 34:59.463
Jeromy and David
are trespassing on Houma

34:59.465 --> 35:01.465
are trespassing on Houma
territory.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.174
>> NARRATOR: R.J. and Jay Paul
Molinere are back from Creole

35:11.176 --> 35:13.143
Molinere are back from Creole
Bayou.

35:15.246 --> 35:18.381
And Jeromy and David are hunting
on their land.

35:47.011 --> 35:49.913
>> JEROMY: ...that I might be
the poacher.

35:54.452 --> 35:57.320
 >> DAVID: I kept telling him we
wasn't.

36:06.697 --> 36:08.598
>> JEROMY: Yeah.

36:25.917 --> 36:28.718
>> NARRATOR: Facing a heavy
fine and possible jail time,

36:28.720 --> 36:30.587
fine and possible jail time,
Jeromy and David need to make

36:30.589 --> 36:32.522
Jeromy and David need to make
things right in a hurry.

36:41.799 --> 36:44.701
>> R.J.: If it had been somebody
stealing our alligator.

37:09.827 --> 37:11.695
Sounds good?

37:22.106 --> 37:25.308
>> NARRATOR: On the swamp,
 honest mistakes can be forgiven

37:25.310 --> 37:26.843
 honest mistakes can be forgiven
quickly, but only if they're

37:26.845 --> 37:28.778
quickly, but only if they're
honest.

37:41.058 --> 37:42.959
(motor starts)

37:49.200 --> 37:52.135
A little shaken by the close
call, Jeromy and David will

37:52.137 --> 37:53.503
call, Jeromy and David will
 finish running their lines then

37:53.505 --> 37:55.305
 finish running their lines then
head to the buyer to settle up

37:55.307 --> 37:57.307
head to the buyer to settle up
with the Molineres.

38:01.012 --> 38:03.546
In Pierre Part...

38:07.251 --> 38:11.021
...Troy and Holden have also had
to fend off a horrible day of

38:11.023 --> 38:12.856
to fend off a horrible day of
looting on the swamp.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.491
looting on the swamp.
But ever since they moved to one

38:14.493 --> 38:16.826
But ever since they moved to one
of Troy's secret honey holes,

38:16.828 --> 38:18.762
of Troy's secret honey holes,
they've been on fire.

38:22.233 --> 38:25.902
And they've got an impressive
28 gators in the boat.

38:32.777 --> 38:35.679
>> TROY: ...I was hoping we
didn't catch no more.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.583
 >> NARRATOR: They have one more
line to check, and it's a

38:40.585 --> 38:42.552
line to check, and it's a
special one.

39:01.205 --> 39:05.842
There's a 12-foot giant on the
bank just waiting on them.

39:11.382 --> 39:14.517
But something's got Troy
alarmed.

39:27.932 --> 39:31.401
If the gator's broken free,
getting on the bank with it

39:31.403 --> 39:33.370
getting on the bank with it
would be suicide.

39:43.881 --> 39:47.517
So Holden will have to make a
shot from the unstable boat.

39:49.620 --> 39:51.821
And he may not get a second
chance.

39:51.823 --> 39:53.790
chance.
(gator snarls)

39:57.261 --> 39:59.162
(gunshot)

40:08.205 --> 40:12.675
Holden's first gator is a
12-foot, 600-pound behemoth.

40:15.446 --> 40:17.781
(Holden chuckles)
And he's thrilled with his

40:17.783 --> 40:19.716
And he's thrilled with his
catch.

40:21.852 --> 40:25.255
>> TROY: Mmm.
The head weighs a hundred pounds

40:25.257 --> 40:26.689
The head weighs a hundred pounds
on that son of a bitch.

40:26.691 --> 40:29.058
on that son of a bitch.
(Troy grunting)

40:29.060 --> 40:30.059
(Troy grunting)
>> NARRATOR: It takes all the

40:30.061 --> 40:31.995
>> NARRATOR: It takes all the
boys' strength...

40:35.933 --> 40:38.134
(grunting)
...but they manage to haul the

40:38.136 --> 40:40.069
...but they manage to haul the
monster up.

40:42.239 --> 40:44.574
Now they have another problem.

40:53.417 --> 40:55.318
(grunting)

41:01.091 --> 41:02.158
>> TROY: Son of a bitch.

41:04.395 --> 41:06.296
Ooh.

41:08.432 --> 41:11.501
>> NARRATOR: Holden's proud of
his big catch.

41:14.872 --> 41:16.973
>> HOLDEN: ...I definitely think
it showed my Uncle Troy that I

41:16.975 --> 41:18.942
it showed my Uncle Troy that I
knew what I was doing.

41:21.145 --> 41:24.214
>> NARRATOR: And Troy's swamp
lesson paid off.

41:52.476 --> 41:56.646
Back on dry land, David and
 Jeromy arrive at the buyer with

41:56.648 --> 41:58.882
 Jeromy arrive at the buyer with
the day's catch and the gator

41:58.884 --> 41:59.983
the day's catch and the gator
they'll split with the

41:59.985 --> 42:01.951
they'll split with the
Molineres.

42:37.888 --> 42:40.790
(Jeromy laughs)
>> R.J.: About eleven-six.

42:40.792 --> 42:42.258
>> R.J.: About eleven-six.
>> JEROMY: Yeah!

42:42.260 --> 42:43.526
>> JEROMY: Yeah!
>> R.J.: Hey, dude, good job,

42:43.528 --> 42:44.594
>> R.J.: Hey, dude, good job,
brother.

42:44.596 --> 42:45.628
brother.
I think it worked out really

42:45.630 --> 42:46.763
I think it worked out really
good because we good people,

42:46.765 --> 42:48.064
good because we good people,
they good people, we worked it

42:48.066 --> 42:50.033
they good people, we worked it
out.
