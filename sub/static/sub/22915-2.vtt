00:01.020 --> 00:02.381
Previously on "Shut Eye"...

00:02.382 --> 00:03.702
Charlie?

00:03.703 --> 00:06.705
I'm a fraud, a charlatan, a fake.

00:06.705 --> 00:08.387
So what do they give me?

00:08.388 --> 00:10.629
A real vision thing.

00:10.630 --> 00:13.472
I saw the future, and I was afraid.

00:13.473 --> 00:15.234
Well, I'm not afraid anymore.

00:15.235 --> 00:16.274
I am.

00:16.276 --> 00:17.876
I got children.

00:17.877 --> 00:19.558
Can't we just fucking go already?

00:19.559 --> 00:20.959
Ma?

00:20.960 --> 00:22.481
Return her personal effects,

00:22.482 --> 00:24.443
and bring her to me
as quickly as possible.

00:24.444 --> 00:25.884
Take care, Sharon.

00:25.885 --> 00:28.487
I do hope your mother's chemo goes well.

00:28.488 --> 00:30.489
- Thanks, Rita.
- What are you still doing here?

00:30.490 --> 00:34.092
I needed a place to crash.
I know your door's always open.

00:34.093 --> 00:37.095
You like it? I got it for you.

00:37.096 --> 00:39.938
I fucking hate you.

00:43.062 --> 00:45.224
I woke up today a million dollars poorer

00:45.225 --> 00:46.825
than I was yesterday.

00:46.826 --> 00:49.107
Now, you're gonna make things
right financially.

00:49.108 --> 00:50.749
She banished me.

00:50.750 --> 00:54.032
She won't let me see my kids ever again.

00:54.033 --> 00:58.357
The Marks family accepts
the ruling of the Kris.

00:58.358 --> 01:03.962
And Simza's son, Li'l Tony, and
my granddaughter are married.

01:03.963 --> 01:07.366
I will move into this new home
with my granddaughter.

01:07.367 --> 01:09.648
- Okay.
- Thank you, Rita.

01:09.649 --> 01:12.210
This is a noble sacrifice.

01:12.211 --> 01:13.572
Where's my fucking money?

01:13.573 --> 01:16.855
$1.7 million in sequential bills,

01:16.856 --> 01:19.898
so you'll have to launder them
before you can use them.

01:19.899 --> 01:23.181
Until then, you got company.

01:35.287 --> 01:36.395
This all of it?

01:36.788 --> 01:38.877
That's what I earned this week.

01:38.878 --> 01:40.239
Thanks, Carl.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.682
Groovy, man. Catch you next time.

01:58.738 --> 02:00.138
Good morning.

02:00.139 --> 02:02.941
You left early. Should've woken me up.

02:02.942 --> 02:04.943
Well, it looked like you'd
just finally gotten to sleep.

02:04.944 --> 02:06.665
Mm.

02:06.666 --> 02:10.749
Well, between your sister's
partying and your boss' snoring,

02:10.750 --> 02:13.512
it's kinda hard to get a good
night's sleep around here.

02:13.513 --> 02:15.554
He's not my boss. And you know Sylvia.

02:15.555 --> 02:17.276
She's never around for long.

02:18.838 --> 02:21.440
That's what you said about Fonso.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.602
It's going on a week, Charlie.

02:23.603 --> 02:25.684
He just wants to be close to his money.

02:25.685 --> 02:28.407
Why doesn't he just take
his money and fucking go?

02:28.408 --> 02:31.290
You know why. No gypsy
will do business with him.

02:31.291 --> 02:34.453
And if he doesn't clean his
money, the Feds will nail him.

02:34.454 --> 02:37.055
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

02:37.056 --> 02:38.777
I know, I know.

02:38.778 --> 02:41.099
"He goes down, we go down."

02:41.100 --> 02:42.901
We just have to stay patient.

02:42.902 --> 02:45.063
The plan is working.

02:46.906 --> 02:48.026
Trust me on this.

02:48.027 --> 02:50.429
I'm trying, honey.

02:52.712 --> 02:53.792
Shit!

02:55.635 --> 02:57.676
Oh, my God.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.342
- Charlie?
- Oh, my God.

02:59.343 --> 03:00.539
Are you there?

03:01.915 --> 03:03.362
Charlie?

03:12.011 --> 03:13.885
Oh.

03:18.017 --> 03:19.298
Oh!

03:19.299 --> 03:21.143
Ah.

03:54.774 --> 03:56.975
You think that's funny?

03:56.976 --> 03:58.777
You think that's funny?!

03:58.778 --> 04:00.098
Fuck you!

_

05:17.056 --> 05:19.498
Mom, I'm gonna be late.

05:19.499 --> 05:21.260
Go and wait outside.

05:21.261 --> 05:23.582
Your aunt's driving you today.

05:23.583 --> 05:24.975
Whatever.

05:28.348 --> 05:30.509
- Sylvia?
- What?

05:32.712 --> 05:35.026
Why is this door locked?

05:36.035 --> 05:39.117
Because you and Charlie
let that shaved ape crash here.

05:39.118 --> 05:40.959
I guess we'll let anything crash here.

05:42.482 --> 05:44.683
I need you to drive Nick to school.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.566
- What, now?
- Yes, now.

05:47.567 --> 05:49.374
Gotta see a doctor.

05:50.209 --> 05:51.960
You don't look sick.

05:54.296 --> 05:56.135
Whatever.

06:03.823 --> 06:05.584
Your mom, she's a piece of work.

06:11.591 --> 06:13.669
Your mom, she's a piece of work, huh?

06:13.670 --> 06:14.633
Yeah.

06:14.634 --> 06:15.714
I mean, she treats me like I'm a kid.

06:15.715 --> 06:17.861
I'm, like, twice your age.

06:18.488 --> 06:19.928
I just wish they'd stop lying to me.

06:19.929 --> 06:21.610
All they do is lie.

06:21.611 --> 06:25.814
Yeah, well, comes with the territory.

06:25.815 --> 06:27.537
Because they're con artists.

06:30.580 --> 06:32.260
It's kinda more complicated than that,

06:32.261 --> 06:34.983
but, uh, yeah, sorta.

06:34.984 --> 06:37.466
No, they never tell me the truth.

06:37.467 --> 06:40.949
Like, the other night, okay,
one minute, we're moving.

06:40.950 --> 06:44.312
The next, we're driving to
the middle of fucking nowhere.

06:45.835 --> 06:47.224
Oh, sorry.

06:48.277 --> 06:50.879
What, for saying "fuck"?
I don't give a fuck.

06:53.242 --> 06:54.803
So we come all the way back

06:54.804 --> 06:58.166
just so my dad can talk to Fonso
or something, right,

06:58.167 --> 07:00.088
who's now sleeping on our couch!

07:00.089 --> 07:01.370
Who the fuck does that?!

07:01.371 --> 07:02.731
Hey, man, at you got taken with.

07:02.732 --> 07:05.325
I got left behind to fend for myself.

07:06.785 --> 07:08.411
Yeah, I guess.

07:10.019 --> 07:12.332
You know what? They're complicated.

07:13.142 --> 07:16.585
I'm sure they're doing the best they can.

07:16.586 --> 07:18.171
It is what it is.

07:19.629 --> 07:21.216
That's not an answer.

07:22.712 --> 07:24.112
Yeah. It's not, is it?

07:24.113 --> 07:25.794
I don't think so.

07:35.324 --> 07:37.045
All right.

07:37.046 --> 07:38.487
Okay, all right.

07:40.169 --> 07:41.736
Mm.

07:42.612 --> 07:44.092
Thanks for the ride.

07:55.138 --> 07:56.389
Yeah.

07:56.390 --> 07:58.947
I think you're coming down
with something.

07:58.948 --> 08:00.629
I'm not.

08:00.630 --> 08:02.671
You wanna have some fun today?

08:02.672 --> 08:03.912
Huh?

08:03.913 --> 08:05.714
Ah.

08:05.715 --> 08:07.836
Okay.

08:07.837 --> 08:09.157
- Yeah?
- Yeah, all right.

08:09.158 --> 08:10.599
Okay.

08:14.924 --> 08:19.568
892, 897, 907...

08:19.569 --> 08:26.334
912, 922, 927...

08:26.335 --> 08:28.417
$947.

08:28.418 --> 08:32.100
Good. Now write it in the book
and add it up.

08:32.101 --> 08:33.371
If I may?

08:33.903 --> 08:35.664
His math is off.

08:35.664 --> 08:37.025
You're gonna come up short

08:37.025 --> 08:39.753
because you counted some $10s as $1s.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.150
Why can't I use a calculator?

08:42.150 --> 08:44.032
Your father never used a calculator.

08:44.033 --> 08:45.967
Yeah, 'cause he didn't know how.

08:47.997 --> 08:49.438
Take this into your father's office

08:49.439 --> 08:51.280
and count it again.

08:59.449 --> 09:01.775
Without a calculator!

09:15.538 --> 09:17.506
How's he handling all this?

09:17.507 --> 09:19.068
Better than me.

09:23.152 --> 09:26.476
Fonso wanted me to tell you
he's thinking about you.

09:29.969 --> 09:30.999
You've seen him?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.883
He's sleeping on my couch.

09:41.250 --> 09:42.691
I never would have thought he'd...

09:42.692 --> 09:44.359
Stoop so low?

09:47.056 --> 09:49.197
- No offense.
- None taken.

09:50.865 --> 09:53.061
I'd really like to help him.

09:53.062 --> 09:55.905
But to be respectful,
I'm still bound by White T.

09:56.826 --> 09:57.906
Wait.

09:57.907 --> 10:02.544
<i>You'd</i> like to help him?

10:03.433 --> 10:05.233
I would like him out of my house.

10:05.234 --> 10:07.997
Ah. That's more like it.

10:12.882 --> 10:17.205
There's an ancient tradition,
goes back to Roman times.

10:17.206 --> 10:19.144
The master of the house

10:19.569 --> 10:24.574
would allow a faithful servant
to buy his freedom.

10:35.264 --> 10:37.203
How much are we talking about?

10:37.667 --> 10:40.123
It's hard to put a number on it, but...

10:41.511 --> 10:43.832
$50,000 should be reasonable.

10:43.833 --> 10:45.044
Hmm.

10:46.129 --> 10:50.920
I think $100,000
would be more reasonable.

10:56.606 --> 10:59.167
$100,000 it is.

10:59.168 --> 11:01.810
Tony! Get back in here!

11:12.382 --> 11:14.657
It's the nicknames that piss me off.

11:15.700 --> 11:17.105
"Dick of Death" is my favorite.

11:21.751 --> 11:22.991
Sorry.

11:22.992 --> 11:24.793
Why not "Death Dick Nick"?

11:24.794 --> 11:26.876
It's got a better ring to it.

11:29.639 --> 11:32.841
Come on, you gotta own it.
Then they can't hurt you.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.689
- You ever seen a shortchange?
- A what?

11:40.690 --> 11:42.451
Watch and learn, Death Dick.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.972
Death Dick Nick, thank you very much.

11:43.973 --> 11:46.054
Whatever. Watch my hands.

11:56.426 --> 11:57.946
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:57.947 --> 11:59.668
- Uh, may I help you?
- Yeah.

11:59.669 --> 12:01.029
I was hoping you could do me a favor.

12:01.030 --> 12:03.472
I've got, like, this big ol' wad of $1s.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.714
Do you wanna just throw me
a $10 bill for 10 singles?

12:05.715 --> 12:07.476
- Sure.
- Okay, awesome.

12:07.477 --> 12:12.200
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

12:12.201 --> 12:13.722
There you go. Go ahead and recount them.

12:13.723 --> 12:15.404
- Uh...
- Yeah.

12:15.405 --> 12:16.885
One, two, three...

12:16.886 --> 12:18.246
You know, that's
a really nice shirt on you.

12:18.247 --> 12:20.008
Oh, thanks.

12:20.009 --> 12:22.611
Yeah, it's a good color for your eyes.

12:26.215 --> 12:28.176
- Uh, there's only nine.
- Are you serious?

12:28.177 --> 12:29.498
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

12:29.499 --> 12:30.939
I think I need a little more coffee.

12:32.301 --> 12:34.342
10... there you go.

12:34.343 --> 12:35.824
Actually, you know what?

12:35.825 --> 12:37.466
I still have, like, all of these singles.

12:37.467 --> 12:39.628
Do you wanna just give me
a $20 for 20 singles,

12:39.629 --> 12:41.470
because I feel like you
could make more use of them

12:41.471 --> 12:42.511
than me, right? Uh, all right.

12:42.512 --> 12:46.154
So 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

12:46.155 --> 12:49.037
16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

12:49.038 --> 12:50.278
There you go.

12:50.279 --> 12:52.641
- Well, thank you.
- No, thank you.

12:52.642 --> 12:54.282
Green is your color. Don't forget.

12:58.368 --> 13:00.128
May I help you?

13:03.493 --> 13:05.393
What just happened?

13:07.897 --> 13:10.148
$10 more than I started with.

13:13.102 --> 13:14.823
My turn.

13:21.284 --> 13:23.872
So, do you remember what happened?

13:23.873 --> 13:27.476
- I think she lost about an hour.
- Yeah, that's not uncommon.

13:27.477 --> 13:29.918
The good news is,
she's alert and oriented now,

13:29.919 --> 13:31.880
and her neurological exam is normal.

13:31.881 --> 13:33.362
That's great.

13:33.363 --> 13:35.043
I don't see any immediate need
for imaging.

13:35.044 --> 13:37.285
- Okay.
- But I would wait a couple weeks

13:37.286 --> 13:38.767
before trying any more rail slides.

13:38.768 --> 13:40.288
And wear a helmet
next time you go 'boarding.

13:40.289 --> 13:41.810
Tony Hawk did.

13:41.811 --> 13:43.011
Who?

13:43.012 --> 13:45.814
Uh, before your time.

13:45.815 --> 13:49.137
So just monitor her
for the next couple of... days,

13:49.138 --> 13:53.181
and, uh, you can just,
uh, call my office.

13:53.182 --> 13:54.983
Why don't you have a seat
in the waiting area,

13:54.984 --> 13:57.986
and we'll get you booked
for a... a follow-up.

13:57.987 --> 13:59.908
Excuse me.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.513
Dr. White, I-I just need a second.

14:04.514 --> 14:06.476
Me, too.

14:12.842 --> 14:14.462
Oh.

14:15.805 --> 14:17.446
I am sorry.

14:17.447 --> 14:19.608
Totally unprofessional of me.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.850
I'm just experiencing
a little bit of, um...

14:21.851 --> 14:23.429
Morning sickness?

14:24.734 --> 14:25.974
Hmm.

14:25.975 --> 14:27.976
Charlie told you I was pregnant.

14:29.499 --> 14:31.562
He also told me how he knew.

14:33.943 --> 14:36.585
What... What exactly did he say?

14:36.586 --> 14:39.278
That he sees crazy fucking wacky shit.

14:40.149 --> 14:42.031
Like dreams, but awake.

14:42.592 --> 14:48.204
Huh. Do they seem to have
increased in frequency?

14:49.158 --> 14:50.873
These incidents?

14:52.321 --> 14:55.003
I think he had one this morning
while he was driving,

14:55.004 --> 14:57.005
but he wouldn't talk about it.

14:59.088 --> 15:01.259
I'm afraid he's gonna hurt himself.

15:04.574 --> 15:07.456
I need a cigarette.
Do you mind if I smoke in here?

15:07.457 --> 15:09.217
I don't know if you heard,

15:09.218 --> 15:10.899
but the Surgeon General
has said that, uh,

15:10.900 --> 15:13.688
smoking is bad for you,
so that would be a no.

15:15.505 --> 15:17.666
Uh...

15:17.667 --> 15:19.988
Listen, I wish I had
an explanation for you.

15:19.989 --> 15:21.237
I really do.

15:24.233 --> 15:26.034
All I can say is that throughout history,

15:26.035 --> 15:27.356
there have been
numerous cases of people...

15:27.357 --> 15:30.371
I know. I read your research.

15:30.960 --> 15:33.041
I ran every test.

15:33.042 --> 15:35.524
Some, honestly, not even in the realm

15:35.525 --> 15:37.646
of what you might call
traditional neurology.

15:37.647 --> 15:40.529
In the absence of any
identifiable medical condition,

15:40.530 --> 15:42.842
we have to consider alternative theories.

15:44.614 --> 15:46.387
He's shutting me out.

15:47.497 --> 15:50.892
It's fucked up. I need you to fix him.

15:51.621 --> 15:53.181
I don't...

15:53.182 --> 15:55.521
I don't know that he's broken.

15:56.906 --> 15:59.828
You fill his head with this bullshit,

15:59.829 --> 16:03.712
and now you're telling me
that there's nothing you can do?

16:03.713 --> 16:05.354
What kind of fucking doctor are you?

16:05.355 --> 16:06.875
Linda, please.
Can you just take a breath?

16:06.876 --> 16:10.078
My family is falling apart.
I cannot sleep.

16:10.079 --> 16:14.282
So I don't have time to take
a fucking breath, okay?!

16:14.283 --> 16:15.564
This is destroying us.

16:15.565 --> 16:17.886
I need you to do something about it!

16:19.168 --> 16:20.529
What if he has a mental illness,

16:20.530 --> 16:23.251
like... like schizophrenia?

16:23.252 --> 16:27.456
While there are some cases
of late-onset schizophrenia

16:27.457 --> 16:30.058
and head trauma does increase the risk,

16:30.059 --> 16:31.299
having hallucinations alone

16:31.300 --> 16:32.981
doesn't meet the diagnostic criteria,

16:32.982 --> 16:35.424
not to mention that
all of his other testing

16:35.425 --> 16:37.947
is perfectly normal.

16:40.430 --> 16:42.472
What the fuck is happening to my husband?

16:45.915 --> 16:48.116
A friend of mine...

16:48.117 --> 16:50.158
A dear friend of mine told me once

16:50.159 --> 16:53.762
that the universe
is... is always speaking to us,

16:53.763 --> 16:56.845
and it's just, few bother to listen.

16:56.846 --> 16:58.584
Maybe he can help.

17:00.450 --> 17:02.380
More fucking wacky shit?

17:04.292 --> 17:05.842
I'm afraid so.

17:07.577 --> 17:09.470
Thanks, Dr. White.

17:44.053 --> 17:45.293
20 bucks.

17:45.294 --> 17:47.015
That is not a bad start.

17:47.016 --> 17:48.457
Gotta say, I've had my doubts,

17:48.458 --> 17:50.979
but you've got Haverford
in your blood after all.

17:50.980 --> 17:53.221
So this is what my parents do,
huh? This is it?

17:53.222 --> 17:57.426
Uh, they pull a more creative
variation, but same idea.

17:57.427 --> 17:58.811
Cool.

18:00.068 --> 18:01.309
Oh, for fuck's sake.

18:01.310 --> 18:02.991
All right.

18:02.992 --> 18:04.833
It's time to get you home, kiddo.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.154
First, show me more.

18:08.638 --> 18:10.439
Yeah, sure.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.120
- Yeah.
- Hey.

18:12.121 --> 18:14.403
Looks like the Dick of Death
found his next victim.

18:15.965 --> 18:17.606
Dick of Death!

18:22.131 --> 18:23.586
All right.

18:24.213 --> 18:25.734
The most important part of the con

18:25.735 --> 18:29.057
is actually identifying
the right mark, right?

18:29.058 --> 18:31.380
Someone ready to be taken.

18:31.381 --> 18:33.942
And you play on their emotional
blind spot, whatever that is...

18:33.943 --> 18:38.935
so guilt, loneliness, greed, love.

18:39.549 --> 18:41.437
That's how you reel them in.

18:43.072 --> 18:44.833
I think I found my mark.

18:49.519 --> 18:51.440
These two dolls are married.

18:51.441 --> 18:53.803
They have to come
to White Tony's with us.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.128
So, did you guys do it yet?

19:01.451 --> 19:03.653
Well, did you? Shut up.

19:08.778 --> 19:12.180
- I bet it happens tonight.
- I said, shut up!

19:12.181 --> 19:14.011
Hey, hey, hey.

19:14.984 --> 19:16.973
Enough already.

19:18.388 --> 19:23.151
Drina, you should stop making it
so hard for your sister.

19:23.152 --> 19:25.474
Hard for <i>her?</i> What about me?

19:25.475 --> 19:26.875
What about you?

19:26.876 --> 19:29.398
You're married with the head
of two families.

19:29.399 --> 19:32.361
- This is really good.
- This sucks.

19:32.362 --> 19:35.645
My life is over because of some
stupid fucking Gypsy tradition!

19:52.422 --> 19:54.760
Tradition is all we have.

19:56.506 --> 19:58.066
Really, Grandma?

19:58.067 --> 20:00.350
Mm-hmm.

20:09.919 --> 20:12.320
Where's Glendale Heights, anyway?

20:12.321 --> 20:15.203
Take the 101 to the 134
and get off at Hell.

20:15.204 --> 20:17.245
Man, it could be worse.

20:17.246 --> 20:18.728
Could be Tarzana.

21:28.958 --> 21:33.403
<i>Sim-sala-bim,</i> and voilà.

21:53.337 --> 21:56.425
You need to put
a better lock on your door.

21:56.426 --> 21:59.218
Eduardo.

22:00.630 --> 22:02.972
You're here for your weekly reading?

22:03.713 --> 22:05.808
There another reason why I'd be here?

22:06.436 --> 22:08.519
No. Uh, how's things?

22:09.318 --> 22:12.041
You're the psychic. You tell me.

22:18.287 --> 22:21.490
The Lovers reversed...
A union of opposites...

22:22.291 --> 22:23.892
the need to heal...

22:24.076 --> 22:25.369
disharmony.

22:26.376 --> 22:29.699
Is there a relationship in
your life that needs resolving?

22:38.788 --> 22:42.871
Wheel of Fortune reversed...
Something is set in motion.

22:42.872 --> 22:45.795
There are difficulties that may continue.

22:52.842 --> 22:54.082
The Emperor.

22:58.488 --> 23:00.530
Friends and colleagues have betrayed you.

23:05.615 --> 23:08.056
Justice, also reversed...

23:08.057 --> 23:10.660
Something remains in flux and unresolved.

23:16.506 --> 23:18.787
What do you think that means, Charlie?

23:18.788 --> 23:21.670
It's more what
my interpretation means to you.

23:21.671 --> 23:23.677
Humor me.

23:25.221 --> 23:26.515
It means...

23:31.481 --> 23:33.762
...the wedding job didn't
satisfy my debt to you.

23:33.763 --> 23:35.604
Not even close.

23:35.940 --> 23:39.287
Most of those cheap bastards
were wearing knock-offs, anyway.

23:39.288 --> 23:41.946
And I had to give some bling back.

23:42.972 --> 23:46.695
- What? What do you mean?
- The father of the bride...

23:46.696 --> 23:48.911
Turns out he's a buddy of mine.

23:57.947 --> 23:59.838
How good of a buddy?

24:03.032 --> 24:04.552
Don't worry.

24:05.435 --> 24:07.429
I didn't tell him about you.

24:12.602 --> 24:14.520
That's two strikes, Charlie.

24:15.124 --> 24:16.897
There won't be a third.

24:25.054 --> 24:26.375
I'm optimistic about this, Charlie,

24:26.376 --> 24:27.456
if you can talk him into it.

24:27.457 --> 24:29.378
- I'll talk to him.
- Eduardo!

24:29.379 --> 24:31.900
- Linda, how you liking the ride?
- I love it.

24:31.901 --> 24:34.582
Hey, I gotta run.
Let me know what happens.

24:35.425 --> 24:36.745
What's all this?

24:36.746 --> 24:38.347
I'm cooking tonight.

24:38.348 --> 24:40.509
<i>- You're</i> cooking?
- Mm-hmm.

24:40.510 --> 24:43.352
Don't act so surprised.

24:44.794 --> 24:48.156
Listen, I need your fun money.

24:48.157 --> 24:49.555
Why?

24:50.720 --> 24:54.226
I conned Simza into a buyout
of our services.

24:54.935 --> 24:56.565
How'd you do that?

24:56.566 --> 24:58.206
I played on her affections

24:58.207 --> 25:01.450
for everyone's favorite house guest.

25:01.451 --> 25:02.851
Fonso and Simza.

25:02.852 --> 25:04.172
But I need to get back to her today,

25:04.173 --> 25:05.974
seal the deal with a down payment.

25:05.975 --> 25:09.779
I scrounged a few grand, but I'm
really gonna need your stash.

25:11.981 --> 25:13.621
My money.

25:15.351 --> 25:16.672
Our money.

25:27.477 --> 25:31.283
Remember my leopard boots,
knee-high, Vegas?

25:32.602 --> 25:33.842
How could I forget?

25:33.843 --> 25:37.227
Back in my closet, right boot.

25:39.128 --> 25:40.564
Thank you, honey.

25:41.971 --> 25:43.492
You'll be back for dinner, right?

25:43.493 --> 25:45.534
I will be back for dinner.

25:45.535 --> 25:47.071
You better.

26:02.752 --> 26:05.153
Nice picture. Yours?

26:05.154 --> 26:07.516
Pulled it off her Instagram...

26:07.517 --> 26:09.677
nothing that can be traced back to me.

26:10.279 --> 26:13.922
Smart kid, playing on
their emotions like this.

26:13.923 --> 26:15.604
I mean, they'll be tripping
over each other

26:15.605 --> 26:18.006
just to show how much of
a good friend they were to Emma.

26:18.007 --> 26:19.768
Which makes them blind to the con.

26:19.769 --> 26:21.188
Yes.

26:22.051 --> 26:24.533
Okay, so now that you've laid
the trap and set the bait...

26:24.534 --> 26:25.894
- Mm-hmm.
- ...don't forget,

26:25.895 --> 26:28.096
you still have to... Yank in the mark.

26:28.097 --> 26:30.614
More like reel in the mark.

26:31.861 --> 26:33.822
Marks... plural.

26:35.344 --> 26:37.329
Look at those assholes.

26:38.027 --> 26:39.915
I'm gonna take 'em all down.

26:41.591 --> 26:43.071
Okay, now is not the time

26:43.072 --> 26:44.993
to let emotion get in the way of things.

26:44.994 --> 26:47.836
How are we gonna get
this message out to the marks...

26:47.837 --> 26:48.997
plural?

26:48.998 --> 26:50.078
Oh. Yeah.

26:50.079 --> 26:53.962
Um, this is a roster

26:53.963 --> 26:56.044
of everybody's school e-mail addresses.

26:56.045 --> 26:57.686
Shit!

26:57.687 --> 26:58.967
Once I press Send,

26:58.968 --> 27:01.019
it goes out from a dummy address.

27:02.692 --> 27:04.523
So, what are you waiting for?

27:05.482 --> 27:06.615
Do it.

27:06.616 --> 27:10.619
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.

27:12.341 --> 27:14.324
Nice.

27:15.909 --> 27:18.226
Don't worry, kiddo.
Everything's gonna be fine.

27:18.227 --> 27:20.909
Here. Drink up, big stuff.

27:20.910 --> 27:21.957
Good work.

27:25.475 --> 27:26.875
Great.

27:26.876 --> 27:27.996
Oh, we have...

27:27.997 --> 27:30.118
- I got it, too.
- I know.

27:45.294 --> 27:47.776
- Oh.
- There you go.

27:47.777 --> 27:49.097
Not bad. Good start.

27:49.098 --> 27:50.258
$15! $15!

27:51.861 --> 27:53.341
What?

27:54.544 --> 27:57.986
How...?

28:04.794 --> 28:06.114
Line it up.

28:17.527 --> 28:20.048
Here, let's go.

28:20.049 --> 28:21.610
There's Daddy!

28:21.611 --> 28:24.453
Remember, Lala, your father
has been banished.

28:24.454 --> 28:26.735
He is unclean. He's not even family.

28:26.736 --> 28:28.296
She knows, Grandma.

28:28.649 --> 28:31.339
Lala! It's Daddy.

28:36.185 --> 28:38.306
Hey, baby! It's locked.

28:38.307 --> 28:40.188
Open up. Sharon, please.

28:40.189 --> 28:41.910
Yes, ma'am.

28:43.353 --> 28:45.113
Baby?

28:45.114 --> 28:47.075
Drina?

28:49.198 --> 28:50.838
Drina.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.603
Lala, please. Come on, baby.

28:57.261 --> 28:58.407
Who the fuck are you?

28:58.408 --> 29:01.049
- I work for Mrs. Marks.
- Yeah, right.

29:01.050 --> 29:02.691
Hey, Ma. Open up.

29:02.692 --> 29:05.694
- Step away from the car, please.
- It's my fucking car.

29:05.695 --> 29:08.336
- Not anymore.
- Drina.

29:08.337 --> 29:10.178
Come on!

29:10.179 --> 29:13.622
Baby! Please?

29:13.623 --> 29:15.237
Lala.

29:16.822 --> 29:17.946
Please?

29:17.947 --> 29:21.511
I won't ask you again.
Step away from the car.

29:28.678 --> 29:30.627
Fuck off.

29:36.966 --> 29:38.847
Aah!

29:45.815 --> 29:47.311
Please, don't.

29:49.338 --> 29:51.381
- Aah!
- Stop it!

29:55.144 --> 29:56.906
Sharon, that's enough.

29:58.468 --> 30:01.470
You f... Okay, okay, okay.

30:05.955 --> 30:08.677
Ah!

30:11.000 --> 30:12.961
Shit!

30:12.962 --> 30:16.365
- Something's burning.
- I know, I know.

30:16.366 --> 30:17.926
- Is Fonso here?
- No.

30:17.927 --> 30:20.128
I have a proposition for him...

30:20.129 --> 30:22.771
something that just might
get him out of our hair.

30:22.772 --> 30:24.373
Well, it better wait until after dinner.

30:24.374 --> 30:26.576
I've been at this all day, God damn it.

30:28.658 --> 30:32.481
Is that <i>my</i> Moroccan chicken recipe?

30:34.066 --> 30:36.184
- Sorry about the mess.
- It's fine.

30:36.185 --> 30:40.228
I mean, a messy kitchen is, um,
like they say, filled with love.

30:40.229 --> 30:43.191
- Oh, that is bullshit.
- It is. I just made it up.

30:44.914 --> 30:49.122
But I appreciate it, with
everything that's been going on.

30:51.120 --> 30:52.459
Thanks.

30:58.608 --> 30:59.888
Something's burning.

30:59.889 --> 31:02.210
Got it. Thank you.

31:02.211 --> 31:03.532
What have you two been up to?

31:03.533 --> 31:05.934
- My résumé.
- Just a school project.

31:05.935 --> 31:08.176
Well, Mom made a special dinner.

31:10.860 --> 31:12.901
I'm... I-I gotta go finish something.

31:12.902 --> 31:15.063
Yeah, we're almost finished.

31:15.064 --> 31:17.305
Hey, what'd the doctor say?

31:17.306 --> 31:20.320
- I'm fine. Thank you.
- Good.

31:21.230 --> 31:23.156
She worked really hard on it.

31:23.833 --> 31:25.834
We're almost done.

31:28.478 --> 31:30.831
You know what we haven't done
in a long time?

31:31.641 --> 31:34.209
Had dinner, just the two of us.

31:34.804 --> 31:36.461
It's fine.

31:37.462 --> 31:40.809
Well, we should probably eat it
before it gets cold.

31:40.810 --> 31:42.134
You saw your doctor?

31:43.343 --> 31:44.469
Yeah, yeah.

31:46.179 --> 31:48.657
That old insomnia thing.

31:48.658 --> 31:50.018
Did he give you something for it?

31:58.227 --> 32:00.028
You!

32:00.029 --> 32:01.269
Come with me.

32:01.270 --> 32:02.951
- Fonso...
- Now!

32:18.211 --> 32:19.796
Fonso.

32:20.450 --> 32:22.090
What are we doing? Where are we going?

32:22.091 --> 32:26.294
- Payback. Now get yours.
- Get my what?

32:26.295 --> 32:27.816
Get your fucking gun.

32:27.817 --> 32:29.898
I-I don't own a fucking gun!

32:29.899 --> 32:33.221
Well, get one. You're backing me up.

32:33.222 --> 32:34.543
Are you looking for revenge

32:34.544 --> 32:35.984
on whoever beat the shit out of you?

32:35.985 --> 32:37.586
They fucking banished me!

32:38.273 --> 32:39.668
I know.

32:39.669 --> 32:42.277
I know, but this won't
get your kids back.

32:42.952 --> 32:44.272
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:44.273 --> 32:45.530
You want payback?

32:46.615 --> 32:48.116
You want vengeance?

32:49.238 --> 32:51.361
There's more than one kind, Fonso.

33:06.696 --> 33:10.379
- Welcome to your new home.
- Thank you for your hospitality.

33:10.380 --> 33:12.432
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you.

33:13.663 --> 33:14.903
Hey, girl.

33:21.951 --> 33:24.593
Tennis courts and pool out back.

33:24.594 --> 33:26.595
We have a squash court inside.

33:26.596 --> 33:27.996
What's squash?

33:27.997 --> 33:30.519
If you ever wanna learn
to play the piano,

33:30.520 --> 33:32.881
we have this tuned once a month.

33:32.882 --> 33:35.604
This is a second living room.

33:35.605 --> 33:39.417
All marble, Italian floors
throughout the house.

33:40.049 --> 33:44.453
And this is White Tony's home office.

33:44.454 --> 33:46.216
What a mess!

33:47.136 --> 33:49.618
I still can't get myself to go inside.

33:49.619 --> 33:51.099
Oh.

33:53.783 --> 33:56.865
Oh, Drina. I almost forgot.

33:56.866 --> 34:00.869
Let me show you the bedroom you
and Li'l Tony will be sharing.

34:00.870 --> 34:02.631
This way!

34:07.116 --> 34:09.317
Hmm?

34:09.318 --> 34:12.033
Isn't it wonderful?

34:13.161 --> 34:14.803
Oh, it's very impressive.

34:14.804 --> 34:16.043
I like sleeping on the right side,

34:16.045 --> 34:18.367
but, for you, I'll switch.

34:18.665 --> 34:20.159
So generous.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.208
Best of all,

34:21.210 --> 34:26.333
your bedroom is conveniently
located right next to...

34:26.335 --> 34:28.617
the future nursery.

34:28.618 --> 34:29.967
Mm.

34:30.659 --> 34:34.422
- Ew! it looks like barf!
- Lala!

34:34.424 --> 34:36.784
You should show respect for our new host.

34:36.786 --> 34:40.989
- But it looks so gross.
- It's the traditional <i>Vlach,</i>

34:40.989 --> 34:42.511
a mourning dish from Romania.

34:45.984 --> 34:48.516
You shouldn't bring
your telephone to the table.

34:48.518 --> 34:49.905
Oh, he's fine.

34:52.001 --> 34:53.783
Of course.

34:55.605 --> 34:58.488
How... How did things go
with the Council?

35:01.771 --> 35:04.377
I'm letting the accountants
deal with everything.

35:05.014 --> 35:09.618
They say that I have a cash-flow problem.

35:09.619 --> 35:11.259
Need to scale back on expenses.

35:11.260 --> 35:12.661
But I thought that White Tony...

35:12.662 --> 35:14.760
Yes. Well, apparently, my dear husband

35:14.761 --> 35:16.224
had most of our money tied up

35:16.225 --> 35:18.827
in various schemes
that are hard to get out of.

35:19.184 --> 35:20.188
I see.

35:20.189 --> 35:22.391
Which is why Drina has to take herself

35:22.392 --> 35:24.353
out of Harvard-Westlake next semester.

35:24.354 --> 35:26.995
- What?!
- It is a luxury we can't afford.

35:27.609 --> 35:28.597
And now that you're married,

35:28.598 --> 35:30.359
you don't need to be spending
that much money

35:30.360 --> 35:32.401
on your education, trust me.

35:32.402 --> 35:34.157
- But I...
- I agree.

35:34.724 --> 35:39.047
Now that you're married, your
life is dedicated to the family.

35:39.048 --> 35:43.541
And an expensive education
is of no practical use.

35:45.134 --> 35:48.096
- So we understand each other?
- Yeah.

35:48.097 --> 35:50.715
There has been much change of late.

35:51.501 --> 35:55.425
It is understandable that we all
have to make some sacrifices.

35:58.468 --> 36:01.990
We should also discuss

36:01.991 --> 36:05.146
consummating the marriage vows tonight.

36:06.898 --> 36:08.692
It's time, don't you think?

36:16.806 --> 36:19.661
Rita? Tonight's the night.

36:20.810 --> 36:25.414
Unfortunately, I don't think
that tonight is the best night

36:25.415 --> 36:27.576
for the physical union

36:27.577 --> 36:30.058
to take place between our two families.

36:30.059 --> 36:35.183
- Hmm. And why is that?
- An old Machvaia superstition.

36:35.184 --> 36:38.680
But it is unwise to bring
a new spirit to the family...

36:39.188 --> 36:42.351
while the spirit of White Tony
still lingers.

36:44.634 --> 36:46.955
Unless you wish to copulate

36:46.956 --> 36:49.607
while your father is still here,
watching?

36:50.560 --> 36:51.901
Um...

36:53.363 --> 36:54.863
I mean...

36:58.158 --> 37:00.889
This house is still <i>marime.</i>

37:00.890 --> 37:02.571
In our family,

37:02.572 --> 37:06.575
the mourning period
to purify a house is 40 days.

37:06.576 --> 37:08.096
Hmm.

37:11.541 --> 37:15.175
Well, in the Ranko family,

37:15.745 --> 37:18.987
we mourn for a fortnight.

37:23.224 --> 37:26.019
A fortnight it is.

37:27.156 --> 37:28.637
Good.

37:40.890 --> 37:42.611
Oh, fuck!

37:55.505 --> 37:58.027
- Shh.
- Shh.

38:02.031 --> 38:04.753
I'm telling you, this is
a good deal. It's a win-win.

38:04.754 --> 38:06.475
Shh.

38:06.476 --> 38:08.196
Listen, you get your money

38:08.197 --> 38:12.240
out from under the pool
and into some real assets.

38:12.241 --> 38:14.363
You want me to go legit?

38:14.364 --> 38:16.004
Well, I mean, if you wanna

38:16.005 --> 38:19.968
call real-estate developers
"legit," then, yeah.

38:19.969 --> 38:21.930
This could be the start
of something big, Fonso...

38:21.931 --> 38:23.612
a new chapter for you.

38:23.613 --> 38:26.214
Yeah. What's in it for you?

38:26.215 --> 38:28.377
You're off my couch.

38:28.378 --> 38:30.208
Why do you have a crowbar?

38:31.060 --> 38:32.901
- I'm breaking in.
- To your own house?

38:32.902 --> 38:34.262
Don't you have keys?

38:34.263 --> 38:36.625
No, I've never had keys.

38:36.626 --> 38:39.676
- Is it locked?
- Of course it's locked.

39:45.455 --> 39:47.135
Easy on the Crown Royal.

39:47.136 --> 39:48.495
Ahh.

40:05.555 --> 40:08.998
Okay. Do that room.

40:16.566 --> 40:18.487
We gotta go. We gotta go!

40:18.488 --> 40:19.984
Yeah, I know.

41:48.337 --> 41:50.018
Fonso.

41:50.019 --> 41:51.409
Fonso!

41:55.264 --> 41:56.664
Wait.

41:58.868 --> 42:00.108
Stay here.

42:00.109 --> 42:01.430
What are you doing?

42:01.431 --> 42:02.751
Fonso, what are you doing?
