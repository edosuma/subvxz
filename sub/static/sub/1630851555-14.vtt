WEBVTT

00:06.840 --> 00:07.674
Proof?

00:07.757 --> 00:09.009
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:09.092 --> 00:10.427
What kind of proof?

00:11.886 --> 00:14.848
Witness videos
of what Simón did to our moms.

00:16.474 --> 00:18.393
We wanted to make him confess.

00:18.476 --> 00:22.772
Many people would love to see
my family involved in a scandal

00:22.856 --> 00:24.816
if the videos ever came to light.

00:24.899 --> 00:27.569
Yes, but we have no idea who has them.

00:29.446 --> 00:32.824
Gregorio must've thought
he could cash in on them

00:34.034 --> 00:35.285
and it cost him his life.

00:36.703 --> 00:40.165
You were right to come to me
and not my son.

00:40.665 --> 00:44.836
You always talk to the owner
of the building, not the doorman.

00:44.919 --> 00:46.713
My PA will pay you.

01:00.018 --> 01:03.938
You need to tell the cops
about the evidence you have.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.191
If I did that…

01:06.274 --> 01:09.194
I know what it would do to me
and my family.

01:10.862 --> 01:12.781
That your silence protects us.

01:16.284 --> 01:18.828
But I think the poor kid's parents

01:19.746 --> 01:23.208
need to know what happened to their son,
don't you?

01:27.420 --> 01:29.297
I have to go. Excuse me.

01:37.263 --> 01:40.391
I hope a USB and a computer

01:40.475 --> 01:43.394
are easier for you to get rid of
than a body.

01:43.478 --> 01:47.107
Boss, you know I ran out of time
that night.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.359
If things get out of hand, Víctor,

01:49.776 --> 01:52.028
I won't be the one to face
the consequences.

02:00.829 --> 02:05.208
Yes, Claudio, but going pro
means leaving the bar,

02:05.291 --> 02:08.586
and Daniel built it for me,
so it would be a slap in his face.

02:08.670 --> 02:12.590
Hold on, while you make a demo
and find a producer,

02:13.133 --> 02:15.844
Daniel will have time
to get used to the idea.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.054
You can't give up your dreams.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.015
He's scared because he loves you.

02:24.519 --> 02:27.188
I was with him
when he had to quit his career

02:27.772 --> 02:29.482
and it hurt him really badly.

02:34.654 --> 02:38.867
You'll make him so happy
by achieving what he couldn't.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.206
Take care.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.542
Thanks, Claudio.

02:49.377 --> 02:52.964
You don't need to work the night shift

02:53.047 --> 02:56.092
because I'll be with Isabel Cárdenas
at the bar.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.804
You two are so close
since the brewery opened.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.055
What's going on?

03:01.139 --> 03:02.891
Yes. We're BFFs now.

03:02.974 --> 03:05.143
And as of this evening, business partners.

03:11.774 --> 03:15.236
He'd finance any kind of business
and you chose that one?

03:15.320 --> 03:17.697
-It's profitable.
-That's not the point!

03:17.780 --> 03:22.076
Why are you and my mom making such a fuss?
It's like any other business.

03:22.160 --> 03:22.994
But Grandpa…

03:23.077 --> 03:25.038
Not old man Marroquín anymore?

03:28.208 --> 03:32.629
Camilo, I won't have to strip
for strangers anymore.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.131
Isn't that what you wanted?

03:36.507 --> 03:38.760
Now I'll only do it for who I want.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.437
Thanks for your time.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.482
-My pleasure.
-I appreciate it. See you.

03:52.565 --> 03:53.816
Have a good one.

04:03.993 --> 04:07.205
Are you sure your worst scenario
is being suspended?

04:09.082 --> 04:12.669
Yes, but don't tell Caridad,
she worries too much.

04:12.752 --> 04:16.673
None of my sisters need to know.
That's what's best for now.

04:17.465 --> 04:18.675
I need a restroom.

04:23.137 --> 04:23.972
Is it him?

04:24.472 --> 04:28.268
No, Jordi never texts in the street.
He says it's too risky.

04:29.560 --> 04:33.189
It's a Tinder guy I'm chatting with.
Isn't he cute?

04:35.984 --> 04:38.194
-Val…
-Don't say a word.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.071
Why'd I even show you? Forget it.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.450
Here's the agreement we talked about.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.828
You just need to sign it.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.249
"Exclusive…"

04:53.584 --> 04:55.837
Hi, Daniel. Isabel Cárdenas.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.798
I appreciate your vote of confidence.

04:58.881 --> 05:03.344
Your bar's exclusivity agreement
is a huge boost for our beer.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.471
Nice to meet you, Isabel.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.808
Could you give us a moment, please?

05:10.351 --> 05:11.811
Sure.

05:16.149 --> 05:20.111
I canceled Pedro's contract
because they missed an order,

05:20.194 --> 05:22.238
and Woman of Courage is much better.

05:22.322 --> 05:26.159
You didn't consult me.
I wouldn't know if it weren't for Claudio.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.453
I was going to tell you later.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.246
I make these decisions, okay?

05:30.330 --> 05:33.875
Any other decisions
you want to make for me, Dad?

05:33.958 --> 05:37.420
Please trust me. I know what I'm doing.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.385
And I took care of you.

05:47.180 --> 05:51.100
Wasn't there another explanation
for what you saw in the warehouse?

05:52.060 --> 05:54.479
I mean apart from thinking I'm a monster.

05:55.813 --> 05:57.273
Can you ever forgive me?

06:01.778 --> 06:04.489
Know what kept me sane
all that time in jail?

06:08.493 --> 06:10.912
Thinking about your naked body next to me.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.793
I loved hearing you sigh
while we made love.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.590
The way you opened your mouth
just a little.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.429
And how I slowly took you

06:30.473 --> 06:31.682
to your final peak.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.604
Remember?

07:37.790 --> 07:38.624
Hi.

07:39.792 --> 07:40.626
Hi.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.670
I hope you remember me.

07:42.753 --> 07:46.257
Of course I do. How are you, Isabel?

07:46.340 --> 07:47.467
I'm fine.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.802
Are you with Federico?

07:49.886 --> 07:51.762
No, I came for work.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.725
He's waiting for me and it's late.

07:58.352 --> 07:59.437
Excuse me.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.356
We've got a hot date.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.277
You came to see your sister?

08:06.360 --> 08:11.657
No, I came to see a guy from Tinder.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.620
If he's half as hot
as he looks in his profile,

08:16.329 --> 08:18.831
my date should be as hot as yours.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.710
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.422
You look gorgeous.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.342
-So do you.
-Thanks

08:40.186 --> 08:41.103
Good evening.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.860
How's it going, guys?

08:48.986 --> 08:50.488
-Who's next?
-Thanks.

08:53.658 --> 08:57.537
Miss Bravo, David Meneses.
Rogelio Marroquín sent me.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.831
-Come to my office.
-Okay, thanks.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.967
-Straight ahead.
-Thank you.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.052
Turn left.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.138
I told Rogelio I don't need a CPA.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.933
I can keep my own accounts.

09:19.475 --> 09:23.104
He knows that,
but since it's registered to a company,

09:23.187 --> 09:25.231
I can make things easier for you.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.483
How does it work?

09:27.567 --> 09:31.904
I pick up the accounting on Saturdays,
put it in my files, and leave.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.156
He pays my fees.

09:35.616 --> 09:36.450
That too?

09:37.159 --> 09:38.411
That's not necessary.

09:39.287 --> 09:44.083
I just follow your grandpa's instructions.
He is very fond of you, Miss Bravo.

09:45.501 --> 09:46.752
It's mutual.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.463
-Take care.
-Sure. Good luck.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.383
-Hi.
-Hi, gorgeous.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.051
-So?
-Are we leaving?

09:54.135 --> 09:55.886
Yes. The place is packed.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.388
-I'll say goodbye.
-Okay.

09:59.724 --> 10:04.103
Since I'm not needed here, I'm leaving.
Please wish me good luck.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.813
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

10:05.896 --> 10:06.981
Thanks.

10:07.064 --> 10:10.359
His name is Roberto Tapias,
single, no police record.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.653
Do you want his address and number?

10:13.529 --> 10:17.450
Look, it didn't even take two minutes.

10:19.368 --> 10:23.289
I knew they'd leave together,
and I'm as overprotective as you are.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.167
Valentina says you don't use cellphones.

10:26.250 --> 10:30.880
Only in low-risk places and then,
I always destroy the chip.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.384
As I was saying,

10:36.427 --> 10:39.764
it's interesting that the nicknames
of the operation's key guys

10:39.847 --> 10:41.140
are species of fish.

10:41.223 --> 10:42.266
Fish?

10:42.350 --> 10:45.853
Yes, fish, Chango,
Bagre, Barracuda, Cabrilla.

10:46.437 --> 10:49.273
I use them
to trail their communications and…

10:57.406 --> 10:59.408
Is Valentina's sister a singer?

11:02.453 --> 11:03.496
And single.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.498
Single?

11:33.484 --> 11:35.277
A guy on Tinder? Really?

11:37.279 --> 11:39.949
I was so wrong about her.

11:40.616 --> 11:43.202
I never thought she was so liberated.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.621
I like her a lot better now.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.081
Come on.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.626
Wipe that sexist brother look
off your face.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.171
Valentina is young, single,

11:54.714 --> 11:58.968
with every right to enjoy her life,
just as you do.

12:00.302 --> 12:01.262
Well?

12:07.685 --> 12:08.602
Like it?

12:14.525 --> 12:16.736
I got it just for today.

12:20.906 --> 12:21.907
Excuse me.

12:25.035 --> 12:25.870
Thank you.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.644
Tonight is to be enjoyed.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.361
Sorry. I don't know what's wrong.

14:04.593 --> 14:05.719
What are you doing?

14:06.762 --> 14:08.264
Calling a cab.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.687
Why? Where are you going?

14:17.273 --> 14:19.191
Federico, this isn't working.

14:33.414 --> 14:37.167
-Bea, I'm exhausted.
-I know.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.545
-It's just--
-I didn't know you sang.

14:44.133 --> 14:48.512
Hi. I'm Valentina's friend and--

14:48.596 --> 14:50.472
You're Jordi, right?

14:50.556 --> 14:53.392
Valentina says you work with computers?

14:55.352 --> 14:58.188
I'm a huge fan
of people who can sing like you.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.025
It's magical to me.

15:02.443 --> 15:05.654
I just wanted to tell you
how much I loved it.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.325
Thank you.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.494
Today was special.
I sing on Fridays and Saturdays.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.039
Come back anytime.

15:15.956 --> 15:18.125
Bea, can you lock up?

15:18.208 --> 15:20.753
-Sure, but please call an Uber.
-Look.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.296
I have pepper spray in my bag

15:22.504 --> 15:24.965
and I won't be intimidated
by someone like Pocho.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.343
-Okay.
-I'll be fine.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.220
See you.

15:30.888 --> 15:31.722
Bye.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.557
-Text me when you get home.
-Yes.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.685
Who is Pocho?

15:37.269 --> 15:40.105
Her dumb ex-husband.
He'll do something crazy one day.

16:05.923 --> 16:10.427
What are you doing with a knife?
Hand it over. And your ID. Now!

16:10.511 --> 16:12.513
Your fucking ID.

16:13.847 --> 16:17.059
Alfonso Sarmiento. They call you Pocho?

16:18.018 --> 16:19.144
Yes. Why?

16:19.228 --> 16:23.315
Matilde isn't alone.
Go near her and I'll smash your face.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.609
Go!

16:33.409 --> 16:35.369
We barely have enough food,

16:35.452 --> 16:38.414
and women and children
keep coming to the convent.

16:42.751 --> 16:45.963
It's a good thing there are people
like you and the nuns.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.263
Rogelio offered me money.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.143
I'm taking it because I can use it

16:59.226 --> 17:03.063
to forge as many documents as I can,
and I know…

17:04.440 --> 17:07.026
I know it's illegal.

17:08.152 --> 17:12.531
But I can save the lives of not one,
but many women,

17:12.614 --> 17:14.283
who can start new lives and…

17:16.118 --> 17:18.037
I can't sit back and do nothing.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.627
Lorenzo. Are you listening?

17:29.798 --> 17:31.633
You're always thinking about others.

17:40.225 --> 17:43.687
How do I get you to trust me again
for good?

17:46.523 --> 17:47.483
No matter what?

17:49.318 --> 17:51.820
I must be in contact with the traffickers.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.449
If they get suspicious, I'm dead meat.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.039
The champagne I ordered.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.258
Good evening. Room service.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.887
Thank you so much. Goodnight.

18:16.970 --> 18:17.930
Good night, miss.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.890
SALMON
CABRILLA, THE GOODS WILL BE READY TOMORROW

18:21.850 --> 18:24.561
There's a meeting tomorrow morning
at city hall.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.355
I have to be in Quintana Roo.

18:28.315 --> 18:31.693
So you're not sleeping at your place,
Miss Mai.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.695
I didn't plan to, Mr. Andrade.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.886
You won't get it
if you're not familiar with encryption.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.055
I looked for communication patterns

19:00.139 --> 19:03.058
based on the last location
of my sister's phone.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.437
Are you sure he's an informant?

19:07.521 --> 19:10.482
Yes, he provided enough proof
to have them arrested today.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.069
What do you know about Bagre?

19:14.153 --> 19:18.240
He reports to Tiburón,
but he's had trouble getting promoted.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.158
How come?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.743
He gets involved
with the women he kidnaps.

19:24.329 --> 19:26.748
I decoded his messages.
Sounds like a politician.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.335
They're all sons of bitches.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.253
TIBURÓN - BAGRE

19:37.384 --> 19:38.260
Take care.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.304
-I had a great time.
-Me too.

19:46.810 --> 19:47.644
Bye.

19:58.614 --> 19:59.448
Sister!

20:01.158 --> 20:02.367
Bye. Thanks.

20:06.371 --> 20:10.667
-What time is this to come home, Miss?
-You tell me. How was it?

20:10.751 --> 20:12.711
I'll ask you the same thing.

20:12.794 --> 20:15.380
-Tell me all about it.
-You first.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.218
Hi. Good morning.

20:21.136 --> 20:24.681
He came to give his condolences.
Care to join us?

20:24.765 --> 20:27.976
I think so. These two must be famished.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.396
No, I had a big breakfast.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.150
Excuse me.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.489
I need to use the bathroom. Excuse me.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.871
You know the condolence thing
is an excuse, right?

20:50.249 --> 20:53.877
-Another of your visions?
-No. Common sense.

20:58.882 --> 21:01.301
Were you really with a stranger all night?

21:02.052 --> 21:03.053
Get out of my room.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.681
How many do you fuck weekly?

21:06.348 --> 21:07.933
Just out of curiosity.

21:08.433 --> 21:11.019
Three or maybe five guys?

21:14.648 --> 21:16.316
-Tell me!
-Get off of me!

21:22.406 --> 21:23.782
I think Isabel knows.

21:26.451 --> 21:30.831
She doesn't know it's you,
but she feels there's someone else.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.916
She wants to take a break.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.923
Aren't we idealizing all this?

21:42.843 --> 21:45.971
Maybe we just suck at sex.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.225
There's only one way to find out.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.105
Avoid me.

21:56.523 --> 21:59.526
Don't come here.
Don't go to Matilde's bar.

21:59.609 --> 22:02.863
I'll never go back to the brewery
or anywhere you are.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.451
You're playing with fire.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.122
Bye.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.918
-Goodbye!
-Okay. I'm going.

22:42.235 --> 22:45.280
Everything about the bad guys
in Tenerife is a lie.

22:51.328 --> 22:52.788
What are you talking about?

22:53.538 --> 22:56.750
I asked Javier to run
a background check on you.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.961
He found out you were released

23:01.880 --> 23:03.799
due to the lack of evidence.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.551
I don't want to talk about it.

23:06.676 --> 23:07.594
Manny.

23:11.264 --> 23:13.683
I reported you to protect you.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.561
I don't get it.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.107
Please explain it to me, honey.

23:28.156 --> 23:30.117
I was hiding from Antonio Lozano.

23:32.452 --> 23:34.996
-He didn't know that Marcela, his kid…
-Marcela?

23:36.498 --> 23:37.582
Yes. Marcela…

23:38.834 --> 23:39.835
was an addict.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.380
She was my girlfriend.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.345
I loved her.

23:52.222 --> 23:53.348
Very much.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.853
I tried to save her from that junk.

24:00.021 --> 24:02.315
She was estranged
from her dad and her family.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.403
She was clean for a while and…

24:09.156 --> 24:10.073
relapsed.

24:16.788 --> 24:17.998
She died of an overdose.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.503
And although we never met,

24:25.255 --> 24:26.923
Antonio always blamed me.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.472
And you were afraid he'd harm you?

24:35.932 --> 24:38.560
He works for the EDOA.
He would've ruined my life.

24:41.730 --> 24:45.066
So you did save me
by sending me to prison.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.006
EVIDENCE

25:11.801 --> 25:12.802
What's this?

25:12.886 --> 25:15.180
They have a search warrant
for Simón's things.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.768
We'll return everything once we're done.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.520
Sorry for all the trouble.

25:23.396 --> 25:26.024
Is this about his death? I'm his brother.

25:26.107 --> 25:28.485
No, it's about the death of a reporter

25:28.568 --> 25:31.446
who tried to blackmail him
the same day he died.

25:32.155 --> 25:34.658
I need you to sign here, ma'am.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.202
Yes.

25:40.747 --> 25:41.581
Excuse me.

25:43.458 --> 25:44.960
-Officer.
-Yes?

25:45.835 --> 25:50.423
Shouldn't my brother's body be exhumed?

25:51.007 --> 25:55.303
It's a different procedure,
but we could give it a try.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.893
Thank you for coming over
to file your testimony, sir.

26:02.978 --> 26:06.773
I hope you understand
I have a procedure to follow.

26:06.856 --> 26:09.359
Please explain that to the colonel.

26:09.442 --> 26:12.237
He thinks very highly of you, Captain.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.741
I'll make sure to tell him
how kind you were to me.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.202
The ring has a spell on it.

26:20.954 --> 26:21.871
I knew it.

26:22.414 --> 26:26.251
With the darkest magic there is.
It protects him as a suit of armor.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.675
No wonder I can't see his aura.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.344
It protects him from what?

26:36.428 --> 26:37.554
From everything.

26:38.555 --> 26:39.931
He's a dangerous man.

26:40.974 --> 26:45.645
I suppose you'll make an example
of the detective.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.023
Count on it, sir.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.191
Stay away from him, Bautista.

26:50.275 --> 26:54.571
The craftsman who made the ring
says he never met anyone like him.

26:54.654 --> 26:55.947
Like what?

26:57.240 --> 26:58.283
Soulless.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.335
Of course they asked a lot of questions.

27:09.252 --> 27:12.339
But I explained
that the night the young man died,

27:12.964 --> 27:17.510
I was with Simón a few hours
before he committed suicide.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.137
It's not a nice memory.

27:20.221 --> 27:21.222
Of course not.

27:21.306 --> 27:24.559
But I didn't ask you over
to cry on your shoulder,

27:25.393 --> 27:28.313
but because they'll definitely
interview Federico too.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.649
So I thought it was best…

27:32.859 --> 27:34.361
for you to tell him.

27:35.362 --> 27:38.323
I'll be back after the nurse
gives me my shot.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.162
What was our agreement?

27:44.871 --> 27:48.541
Grandpa asked me to come over.
He didn't mention you.

28:07.143 --> 28:07.977
Good night.

28:08.061 --> 28:10.188
-Good night.
-Thank you, Melisa.

28:12.315 --> 28:17.070
The cops want to exhume Simón's body
because of the Robles event.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.155
I should've known.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.450
They'll find nothing to refute it.

28:24.577 --> 28:28.164
We'd be fine if Valentina hadn't mentioned
the evidence to the cops.

28:29.332 --> 28:33.545
Víctor, good jigsaw puzzle fans
adapt to the circumstances

28:33.628 --> 28:37.382
and know when to change their strategy.

28:38.967 --> 28:43.179
Tell them I'm not feeling well
and I went to bed.

28:44.514 --> 28:46.766
I don't think they'll mind being alone.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.353
They're siblings, Boss.

28:50.979 --> 28:53.815
Yes, and the crime of incest

28:55.483 --> 28:57.402
is now punishable by law.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.205
Let's go to a hotel.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.421
Hey, Valentina.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.467
We didn't grow up together.

29:21.342 --> 29:25.054
I met you on a beach.
You're the woman I love and desire.

29:30.977 --> 29:33.021
Please tell me you feel the same way.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.498
No, Valentina. Please wait.

29:58.546 --> 29:59.380
Caridad.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.844
I knew you'd call me tonight.

30:07.430 --> 30:11.726
Better, thank you.
A little tired from the interviews.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.773
I thought Valentina told you.

30:18.566 --> 30:19.984
We had the right to comment.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.362
Will they interview us?

30:23.613 --> 30:25.073
I don't know.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.743
Who named you Madam President?

30:28.827 --> 30:31.538
We said we wouldn't tell the cops
about the evidence.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.916
You're so arrogant, Valentina.
Grandpa was affected too.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.961
And you're willing to face
any consequences

30:38.044 --> 30:40.046
to help your dear friend.

30:40.713 --> 30:42.465
-Caridad…
-No. Leave me alone.

30:53.351 --> 30:56.980
The next time you doubt someone
related to me, let me know.

30:58.189 --> 31:01.484
We thought Camilo was Andrade's partner.
He's a criminal.

31:01.568 --> 31:07.198
A criminal because they rescued 14 women
who were being taken to the US?

31:07.282 --> 31:08.199
What?

31:09.826 --> 31:10.994
I just heard.

31:13.413 --> 31:17.709
Matilde is right.
You're intolerably arrogant sometimes.

31:24.591 --> 31:27.343
You're leaving too
after throwing me to the lions?

31:27.427 --> 31:30.889
-My sisters hate me.
-I'm under a criminal investigation.

31:33.975 --> 31:34.934
I could go to jail.

31:37.812 --> 31:38.688
See you later.

31:41.357 --> 31:42.191
Shit.

31:45.486 --> 31:46.321
Okay.

31:47.572 --> 31:48.907
Okay, Fede.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.825
See you tomorrow.

31:54.996 --> 31:59.667
The box at Fede's place
doesn't have Valentina's stolen proof.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.712
So Simón did take his own life.

32:04.297 --> 32:07.884
Or whoever has the proof
preferred him dead than face a scandal.

32:09.260 --> 32:13.264
I know Rogelio was a bad dad,
but you're exaggerating.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.558
He's so sweet to his grandchildren.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.810
-Trusting him is a mistake.
-Ignacio!

32:18.519 --> 32:21.189
My dad is not the honorable man
you guys think he is.

32:22.106 --> 32:25.735
He's hiding something.
My brother died because he discovered it.

32:26.611 --> 32:27.528
My mom did too.

32:29.572 --> 32:32.408
My mom was a great woman.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.289
The best mom you could ever have.

32:40.124 --> 32:43.461
Her only mistake was falling in love
with Rogelio Marroquín.

32:49.926 --> 32:55.306
Why don't great women
fall in love with guys like me?

32:59.811 --> 33:02.522
Because we're such fools.

33:25.253 --> 33:28.423
I'm Isabel. Federico's girlfriend.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.384
-Federico's girlfriend?
-Yes.

33:31.467 --> 33:32.635
He didn't tell me.

33:32.719 --> 33:36.514
-You must've met in the U.S.
-Yes.

33:36.597 --> 33:39.642
I'm so glad to see you're better.

33:39.726 --> 33:43.271
-How are you, Camilo?
-Fine. Thank you.

33:43.896 --> 33:44.981
-Look.
-Yes.

33:45.064 --> 33:50.611
I was just telling this charming woman
how ungrateful you are.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.530
Why didn't you introduce us?

33:53.698 --> 33:55.992
We've been very busy with the business.

33:57.535 --> 34:01.330
I told you to call before coming.
You can't get all worked up like that.

34:02.915 --> 34:06.252
I'm not as feeble as my grandson
must've told you.

34:07.754 --> 34:10.006
Would you like a tour, Mr. Marroquín?

34:10.590 --> 34:13.092
Only if you call me Rogelio.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.845
-Rogelio.
-I would love to.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.310
She's gonna leave you for him.

34:23.519 --> 34:28.107
Dude, is your grandpa's ring
from a club or something?

34:29.859 --> 34:32.070
No idea. He always has it. Why?

34:32.153 --> 34:33.362
Just curious.

34:34.989 --> 34:38.576
A politician I worked for
had one just like it.

34:39.619 --> 34:40.453
Really?

34:42.121 --> 34:44.123
When he came to see me…

34:45.666 --> 34:47.919
he didn't look well and I'm worried.

34:48.586 --> 34:50.171
It's his father's death,

34:50.254 --> 34:54.258
and going from being an only child
to one of six.

34:55.843 --> 34:59.305
-I guess you know his sisters.
-Yes.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.975
They're wonderful,
but I worry about them too.

35:03.893 --> 35:09.440
Especially Caridad and Matilde,
they seem to be so vulnerable.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.567
Matilde, vulnerable?

35:13.611 --> 35:16.114
I think she's quite the opposite.

35:17.115 --> 35:20.868
We do business with her bar,
so she's the one I'm closest to.

35:22.495 --> 35:23.913
I didn't know that.

35:23.996 --> 35:24.831
Isabel.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.919
Would it be too much trouble
to ask you to find out

35:30.795 --> 35:33.714
what Matilde's relationship
with the owner is?

35:35.675 --> 35:39.220
I don't want to sound paranoid,
but it's very weird.

35:39.929 --> 35:41.848
They get along just fine.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.309
The weird thing is they call each other
Dad and Daughter.

35:46.894 --> 35:48.062
Dad and Daughter.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.115
I can't sleep.

36:00.324 --> 36:02.285
The house's energy is too dark.

36:07.707 --> 36:10.126
Did your quartz crystals die or what?

36:11.210 --> 36:12.211
Sorry, sorry.

36:13.629 --> 36:15.339
Rogelio wants to harm us.

36:15.923 --> 36:19.886
He's a shady guy.
And his ring has a black magic charm.

36:22.471 --> 36:24.098
This house, his presents,

36:24.765 --> 36:28.561
are part of a plan to hurt us, I know it.

36:59.425 --> 37:01.510
I told you the girl is dangerous.

37:02.386 --> 37:03.804
She's suspicious of me.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.892
I think it's time to get rid of her.

37:14.106 --> 37:15.274
Got it, Tiburón.

38:42.486 --> 38:44.697
