Masters Krell and Tiin will be
supporting my troops in the south,

00:46.364 --> 00:48.614
while Anakin's battalion
Comes in from the north,

00:48.739 --> 00:50.604
and takes out enemy reinforcements.

00:50.729 --> 00:54.303
It is imperative that we conquer
the capital city as quickly as possible

00:54.637 --> 00:55.721
and hold it.

00:55.929 --> 00:58.139
Our biggest problem
is gonna be the local militia.

00:58.352 --> 01:00.642
{pos(192,220)}The umbarans have aligned
themselves with the separatists,

01:00.767 --> 01:02.061
{pos(192,220)}and are heavily armed.

01:02.229 --> 01:05.438
{pos(192,220)}Arc trooper fives will be assisting
my units on special assignment.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.650
{pos(192,220)}Ready to do my part,
general Skywalker.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.158
{pos(192,220)}Nice to have you on board.

01:09.283 --> 01:12.124
- Just like old times, rex.
- Remember Anakin,

01:12.249 --> 01:14.592
Cody and I will be
12 klicks to your south.

01:14.977 --> 01:17.298
We're counting on you to take out
those local fighters,

01:17.423 --> 01:20.576
Or, I'm afraid,
the capital will never surrender.

01:21.051 --> 01:23.656
Does my battalion
have to do everything?

01:24.583 --> 01:26.874
You seem to always volunteer.

01:29.937 --> 01:31.700
All right, let's go!

02:11.215 --> 02:13.096
There's a lot of surface fire.

02:13.369 --> 02:15.761
They ain't got nothin'
we can't handle, sir.

02:19.916 --> 02:21.392
It ain't got top?

02:21.517 --> 02:23.141
So far, so good, captain.

02:24.215 --> 02:26.687
General skywalker,
I'm turning the lights out.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.679
Our night vision sensors are having
a tough time in this chop.

02:29.804 --> 02:31.776
I hope we don't overshoot
the landing site.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.028
Just get us as close as you can.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.797
Time to lock and load.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.440
After 'em, boys!

03:12.565 --> 03:14.151
- Let's go!
- All right!

03:14.793 --> 03:16.283
- Wipe 'em out!
- Get them!

03:19.474 --> 03:20.574
Too many of 'em!

03:33.500 --> 03:34.869
Out of the way!

03:39.150 --> 03:40.843
Take it down, take it down!

03:43.862 --> 03:45.195
>> take it down!

03:59.717 --> 04:01.916
Go, go, go!
Give it to 'em!

04:03.000 --> 04:04.556
Go, go, go!

04:05.529 --> 04:07.455
Take 'em out!
Take 'em all...

04:09.158 --> 04:12.300
That's the stuff.
That's the...

04:12.523 --> 04:13.711
Incoming!

04:25.474 --> 04:26.474
That's it!

04:27.191 --> 04:28.377
Give it to 'em!

04:30.683 --> 04:31.646
Let's go!

04:32.770 --> 04:33.977
Go, go, go!

04:35.507 --> 04:36.419
Right...

04:39.352 --> 04:42.323
This map has a ridge
at 23 degrees north, northwest.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.659
Good. We can use it
as a staging area.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.319
That's it!
Take 'em round right!

04:47.955 --> 04:50.071
Keep movin'.
We've got to claim that ridge.

04:50.196 --> 04:52.321
The other battalions
are counting on us!

04:52.764 --> 04:53.709
Let's go!

05:05.389 --> 05:06.820
Don't strength to far.

05:06.945 --> 05:09.542
The enemy could have the whole place
rigged with traps.

05:10.241 --> 05:12.019
I can't even see the enemy!

05:12.273 --> 05:13.266
Go, go, go!

05:14.982 --> 05:17.382
That's why they're called
the shadow people, tup.

05:17.980 --> 05:18.953
Come on!

05:20.487 --> 05:22.890
- Everybody, take cover!
- Go, go, go!

05:27.161 --> 05:29.052
It's just a vine.
Keep moving, Hardcase.

05:29.177 --> 05:31.050
Yeah, I got it all under control.

05:52.683 --> 05:54.082
That's not right.

06:07.059 --> 06:08.336
Nice work, fives.

06:08.630 --> 06:09.846
Hardcase, right?

06:10.110 --> 06:12.516
Yeah. That's what they call me.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.994
{PUB}General Kenobi's battalion sir?

06:52.162 --> 06:55.826
They're pushing towards the capital.
As soon as the men are ready.

06:56.709 --> 06:58.666
All platoons have reported in,
general.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.359
Get some rest.

07:00.484 --> 07:01.555
Thank you, sir.

07:02.103 --> 07:03.055
I'm fine.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.593
The general's giving you an order,
Dogma.

07:05.718 --> 07:06.920
Of course, sir.

07:08.370 --> 07:10.799
He's wound tight, but he's loyal.

07:11.792 --> 07:13.616
He kind of reminds me of you.

07:14.163 --> 07:15.075
Maybe...

07:15.430 --> 07:16.788
Back in the day.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.844
- What is that?
- Look out!

07:56.907 --> 07:59.420
Ambush, they're behind us!

08:08.317 --> 08:10.029
The enemy's circled behind us.

08:10.154 --> 08:12.798
Everybody, we must defend our backs!

08:21.035 --> 08:23.377
I'm calling an air strike
on the enemy positions.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.838
Let's hope they're not
too busy helping Obi-wan.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.629
There's an opening to our south.

08:27.754 --> 08:29.389
I recommend we move all platoons

08:29.514 --> 08:32.053
off the ridge in case
the air strike overshoots.

08:32.323 --> 08:33.638
Good thinking, Rex.

08:33.806 --> 08:35.775
Everyone, move out now!

09:05.853 --> 09:06.914
All here sir.

09:07.039 --> 09:09.430
Stay covered.
We have to hold the position.

09:11.539 --> 09:13.738
Are you sure those bombers
are coming?

09:23.605 --> 09:24.964
Good old odd ball,

09:25.089 --> 09:26.274
Always on target.

09:31.448 --> 09:32.979
Glad we got all of that ridge.

09:34.972 --> 09:36.594
That'll teach 'em.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.034
{pos(192,220)}General Krell is here?

09:59.159 --> 10:01.183
{pos(192,220)}Something big must be going on.

10:02.564 --> 10:05.574
Master Krell,
my thanks for the air support.

10:05.808 --> 10:07.338
Indeed, general skywalker.

10:07.463 --> 10:11.044
The locals have proven to be
more resourceful than we anticipated.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.613
But that's not the reason
for your visit.

10:13.781 --> 10:14.439
No.

10:14.564 --> 10:17.036
The council has ordered you
back to coruscant.

10:17.161 --> 10:18.743
Effective immediately.

10:18.911 --> 10:19.660
What?

10:20.390 --> 10:21.079
Why?

10:21.371 --> 10:24.366
I'm afraid a request was made
by the supreme chancellor,

10:24.491 --> 10:26.062
and the council obliged.

10:26.187 --> 10:29.834
- That is all they would tell me.
- I can't just leave my men.

10:30.089 --> 10:31.952
I'll be taking over in the interim.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.310
Don't worry about a thing, sir.

10:34.435 --> 10:36.392
We'll have this city under
Republic control,

10:36.517 --> 10:38.753
- by the time you're back.
- Master Krell,

10:39.006 --> 10:41.682
this is rex, my first in command.

10:42.067 --> 10:45.061
You won't find a finer
or more loyal trooper anywhere.

10:45.422 --> 10:48.057
Good to hear that.
I wish you well, skywalker.

11:06.055 --> 11:07.950
Your reputation presuide General.

11:08.165 --> 11:09.949
It is an honor to be serving you.

11:10.074 --> 11:12.411
I find it very interesting captain,

11:12.685 --> 11:16.273
that you are able to recognize
the value of honor, for a clone.

11:18.095 --> 11:20.054
Stand at attention
when I address you.

11:21.897 --> 11:23.559
Your flattery is duly noted,

11:23.684 --> 11:25.581
but it will not be rewarded.

11:25.706 --> 11:27.812
There's a reason my command
is so effective.

11:28.086 --> 11:30.346
And it's because I do things
by the book.

11:30.766 --> 11:32.590
And that includes protocol.

11:33.158 --> 11:35.383
Have all platoons ready
to move out immediately.

11:35.738 --> 11:36.812
That is all.

11:48.607 --> 11:50.251
Quick in that place battalion!

11:50.419 --> 11:52.540
This isn't some training
course on Kamino.

11:52.987 --> 11:55.895
The new general has a way with words.

11:56.179 --> 11:58.112
He's just trying to keep
us on schedule.

11:58.237 --> 11:59.916
By raising everyone's ire?

12:00.179 --> 12:01.933
Either way, he's in charge,

12:02.058 --> 12:04.454
and we've got a job to do.
Just treat him with respect,

12:04.579 --> 12:06.218
and we'll all get along fine.

12:06.533 --> 12:07.560
Do you see that?

12:09.313 --> 12:10.121
Yeah.

12:10.246 --> 12:11.824
Ready your weapons.

12:47.613 --> 12:50.144
Anyone else wana prop
and play with the animals?

12:52.294 --> 12:53.623
Didn't think so.

12:54.201 --> 12:55.609
Now keep moving!

13:08.986 --> 13:09.746
Sir,

13:10.202 --> 13:12.533
We've been keeping
this pace for 12 hours now.

13:12.756 --> 13:14.439
The men are getting worn down.

13:14.564 --> 13:15.969
We should rest.

13:18.869 --> 13:19.862
General Krell.

13:20.125 --> 13:23.092
The top of this ridge will make
a good place for the men to make camp.

13:23.217 --> 13:24.601
The men don't need rest.

13:24.726 --> 13:27.550
They need the resolve
to complete the task at hand.

13:27.675 --> 13:32.043
- But, sir...
- CT-7567, are you reading me?

13:32.661 --> 13:33.939
Excuse me, sir?

13:34.445 --> 13:38.039
I asked you a question, CT-7567.

13:38.252 --> 13:41.110
Do you understand the need
To adhere to my strategy?

13:41.235 --> 13:44.211
Sir, the terrain
is extremely hostile.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.728
Despite the difficulty
of the conditions,

13:46.853 --> 13:48.633
The battalion is making good time.

13:48.758 --> 13:50.853
These men just need a little break.

13:51.677 --> 13:54.099
Captain, do I need to remind you
Of this battalion's

13:54.224 --> 13:56.451
Strategic mission
in conquering this planet?

13:56.704 --> 13:57.649
Look back.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.380
See those platoons?

13:59.636 --> 14:02.403
Their mission is to take this
city and take it swiftly.

14:02.656 --> 14:05.920
Time and rest are luxuries
the republic cannot afford.

14:06.244 --> 14:08.383
We are the key to this invasion.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.350
The other battalions
are counting on our support.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.907
If we fail, everyone fails.

14:14.032 --> 14:15.701
Do you understand this?

14:15.826 --> 14:17.880
Do all of you understand this?

14:18.901 --> 14:20.001
Now move on!

14:37.650 --> 14:39.994
{PUB}Sir, ready to bring
our forward platoons in

14:40.119 --> 14:42.214
for a surgical strike
on the city's defenses.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.221
There won't be any need, captain.

14:44.346 --> 14:46.513
- Sir?
- All platoons will execute,

14:46.638 --> 14:49.340
a forward assault along
the main route to the city.

14:49.894 --> 14:52.057
But, sir, general skywalker's plan,

14:52.182 --> 14:54.246
was to surprise them
with multiple attacks.

14:54.371 --> 14:56.955
If we come in from the main route,
they're likely to engage us

14:57.080 --> 14:58.496
in a full-frontal assault.

14:58.621 --> 15:00.213
Change of plans, captain.

15:00.477 --> 15:02.109
I'm in command now.

15:02.528 --> 15:06.451
With all due respect, general,
we don't know what we are up against.

15:06.576 --> 15:08.329
It might be wiser to think first.

15:08.454 --> 15:10.437
Are you questioning my order?

15:11.410 --> 15:14.820
This battalion will take the main road
straight to the capital.

15:15.225 --> 15:17.485
You will not stop
and you will not turn back,

15:17.610 --> 15:19.418
regardless of the resistance
you meet.

15:20.110 --> 15:22.409
We will attack them
with all our troops,

15:22.534 --> 15:24.735
not some sneak attack with a few men.

15:25.145 --> 15:26.673
That is my order,

15:26.957 --> 15:28.913
And you will follow it explicitly.

15:29.038 --> 15:33.050
Do I make myself clear, CT-7567?

15:33.729 --> 15:35.051
Yes, general.

15:35.344 --> 15:36.530
Now engage.

15:56.457 --> 15:59.040
Why are we sticking to
the original plan

15:59.165 --> 16:01.130
and probing the city defenses first?

16:01.343 --> 16:02.519
We can do this.

16:02.644 --> 16:03.755
Let's take 'em!

16:03.983 --> 16:06.608
Yeah, leave it to Hardcase
to dive in head-first.

16:07.135 --> 16:08.801
The general's new plan is reckless.

16:09.081 --> 16:12.497
You ever think that maybe the general
knows what he is doing?

16:13.071 --> 16:15.696
I know you think this is a bad idea.

16:16.253 --> 16:19.243
I raised my objection
to general Krell's plan,

16:19.368 --> 16:20.671
But he didn't agree.

16:20.796 --> 16:22.374
So this is it.

16:22.860 --> 16:24.705
Well, what if he's wrong?
Then what?

16:25.252 --> 16:27.142
This isn't the time for a debate.

16:27.267 --> 16:29.068
Right now, we have to stay alert.

16:37.651 --> 16:39.738
It's too quiet out there.

16:51.968 --> 16:53.641
Mines! Nobody move!

17:05.272 --> 17:06.449
Hawk is down.

17:07.542 --> 17:08.617
So is Ringo.

17:09.772 --> 17:11.222
Can you sweep 'em?

17:13.759 --> 17:15.259
There are more over here.

17:15.482 --> 17:17.732
Looks like the whole road's
been booby-trapped.

17:18.624 --> 17:20.615
Everyone, watch your step.

17:31.301 --> 17:32.969
We're completely exposed!

17:33.137 --> 17:34.313
Hold your ground!

17:35.889 --> 17:37.598
You want a piece of this?

17:43.027 --> 17:44.855
I think Hardcase made 'em mad.

17:50.362 --> 17:53.539
- We're blown!
- The umbarans are advancing!

17:54.658 --> 17:55.908
Make 'em eat heat!

18:18.891 --> 18:21.851
- They're coming from all directions.
- We don't have any cover!

18:22.019 --> 18:24.399
We need to pull back.
Get them to follow us.

18:24.524 --> 18:26.669
If we can draw them out,
we can see them.

18:26.794 --> 18:28.676
If we can see them, we can hit them.

18:29.540 --> 18:32.530
All squads, pull back now!

18:33.494 --> 18:34.893
This can't be good.

18:48.378 --> 18:49.962
Feeble-minded clones.

18:51.202 --> 18:53.070
Get in there and save their necks.

18:57.641 --> 18:59.698
Get ready, here they come!

19:11.063 --> 19:13.475
Hit 'em with everything you've got.

19:20.211 --> 19:21.452
Where you goin'?

19:21.703 --> 19:22.877
Get back here!

19:27.543 --> 19:29.418
They're falling back!

19:32.294 --> 19:34.340
CT-7567,

19:34.726 --> 19:37.199
do you have
a malfunction in your design?

19:37.462 --> 19:40.482
{pos(192,220)}You've pulled your forces back
from taking the capital city.

19:40.607 --> 19:42.959
{pos(192,220)}The enemy now
has control of this route.

19:43.246 --> 19:47.371
{pos(192,220)}This entire operation has been
compromised because of your faillure!

19:47.688 --> 19:50.166
General Krell,
in case you haven't noticed,

19:50.291 --> 19:52.409
Captain rex just saved this platoon.

19:52.534 --> 19:55.269
Surely you won't fail
to recognize that.

19:55.696 --> 19:57.033
Arc-5555,

19:58.289 --> 19:59.536
Stand down.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.555
Sir, yes, sir.

20:03.094 --> 20:06.330
Sir, if I may address
your accusation,

20:06.682 --> 20:08.436
I followed your orders,

20:08.561 --> 20:11.500
Even in the face of a plan that was,
in my opinion,

20:11.625 --> 20:13.045
severely flawed,

20:13.213 --> 20:15.399
A plan that cost us men, not clones!

20:15.977 --> 20:16.737
Men!

20:18.531 --> 20:22.397
As sure as it is my duty
to remain loyal to your command,

20:23.067 --> 20:26.756
I also have another duty,
to protect those men.

20:29.188 --> 20:32.440
You have a spoke of tenacity captain.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.801
I'll give you that.

20:33.926 --> 20:37.450
I know that I don't command
like the jedi you're used to serving.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.551
Certainly not like General skywalker.

20:40.098 --> 20:41.679
But I have my way.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.402
It may be difficult,

20:43.527 --> 20:45.743
But these are difficult times.

20:45.868 --> 20:47.810
And it's proven effective.

20:48.256 --> 20:51.335
I suppose your loyalty to your men
is to be commended.

20:51.874 --> 20:53.891
They seem to admire this.

20:54.159 --> 20:56.797
That's important
to an effective commander.

20:57.798 --> 21:01.741
All right, captain Rex,
your opinion has been noted.

21:02.763 --> 21:03.707
Dismissed.

21:07.477 --> 21:09.852
I think he almost complimented you.

21:10.893 --> 21:11.979
It's hard to tell.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.147
Incoming!

21:20.639 --> 21:22.767
The Umbaras must regrouped
for a counterattack.

21:22.980 --> 21:25.088
Everyone, we must hold this position.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.498
You think general Krell
still intends on taking

21:27.623 --> 21:30.066
- the capital using this strategy?
- I don't know.

21:30.191 --> 21:32.611
I'll get back to you on that
if we survive this battle.
