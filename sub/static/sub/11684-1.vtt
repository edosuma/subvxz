WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:02.970
- MY NAME IS MICHAEL WESTEN.

00:03.003 --> 00:05.473
I USED TO BE A SPY UNTIL--

00:05.506 --> 00:06.640
[phone rings]
- WE GOT A BURN NOTICE ON YOU.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.476
YOU'RE BLACKLISTED.
- [whistles]

00:08.509 --> 00:10.878
WHEN YOU'RE BURNED,
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING.

00:10.911 --> 00:13.214
NO CASH, NO CREDIT,
NO JOB HISTORY.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.649
YOU'RE STUCK IN WHATEVER CITY
THEY DECIDE TO DUMP YOU.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.485
WHERE AM I?
- MIAMI.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.221
- YOU DO WHATEVER WORK
COMES YOUR WAY.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.690
YOU RELY ON ANYONE
WHO'S STILL TALKING TO YOU.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.924
[laughs]

00:23.957 --> 00:25.025
A TRIGGER-HAPPY GIRLFRIEND...

00:25.059 --> 00:26.427
- SHOULD WE SHOOT THEM?

00:26.460 --> 00:28.929
- AND OLD FRIEND WHO USED
TO INFORM ON YOU TO THE FBI...

00:28.962 --> 00:29.930
- YOU KNOW SPIES.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.165
BUNCH OF BITCHY LITTLE GIRLS.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.067
- FAMILY TOO.
- HEY, IS THAT YOUR MOM AGAIN?

00:33.101 --> 00:34.268
[phone rings]
- IF YOU'RE DESPERATE.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.603
- SOMEONE NEEDS
YOUR HELP, MICHAEL.

00:35.636 --> 00:38.539
- AND A DOWN AND OUT SPY
YOU MET ALONG THE WAY.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.074
- THAT'S HOW WE DO IT, PEOPLE.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.575
- BOTTOM LINE?

00:41.609 --> 00:44.612
AS LONG AS YOU'RE BURNED,
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.783
[gunshot]

00:49.817 --> 00:52.953
HEY! NATE! NATE!

00:52.986 --> 00:53.954
- GRAY SHOT YOUR BROTHER.

00:53.987 --> 00:57.191
- YOU ORDERED HIM TO!

00:57.225 --> 00:59.460
CARD'S DEAD, FI,
NOW WE NEED A WAY OUT OF HERE.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.729
- THERE'S A FULL TACTICAL
SUPPORT TEAM ON SITE

01:01.762 --> 01:04.532
AND SOME HEAVY HITTER
SEEMS TO BE RUNNING THE SHOW.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.435
- YOU KILLED TOM CARD AND YOUR
FRIENDS HELPED YOU ESCAPE.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.803
YOU ARE NOW ENEMIES
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.272
- NOW I DIDN'T
BETRAY MY COUNTRY.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.273
I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT IT.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.475
- I DON'T CARE.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.743
- RILEY HAS GONE ROGUE.

01:15.776 --> 01:19.713
SHE SENT A HIT TEAM AFTER US.

01:19.747 --> 01:20.714
- DROP IT, WESTEN.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.750
- HEAVE TO AND STOP YOUR VESSEL.

01:22.783 --> 01:27.054
- EITHER YOU CONFESS
OR WE BOTH DIE RIGHT NOW.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.656
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO MAKE THAT CALL.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.824
- FIVE, FOUR...
- IT ENDS TODAY.

01:30.858 --> 01:31.925
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL CALL!

01:31.959 --> 01:32.993
- THREE...
- JUST CALL THEM OFF.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.895
- TWO--
- GUNNERY STATION, STAND DOWN.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.297
- WE'VE BEEN HERE THREE WEEKS.

01:36.330 --> 01:39.700
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
TO "SORT OUT WHAT HAPPENED"?

01:41.935 --> 01:44.905
WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET OUT?

01:44.938 --> 01:47.575
IN PANAMA, YOU SAID
THAT WE WERE DONE WITH ALL THIS.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.177
YOU SAID IT WOULD JUST BE US.

01:49.210 --> 01:52.313
- I NEEDED TO PROTECT YOU.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.747
I NEEDED TO PROTECT ALL OF US.

01:53.781 --> 01:57.651
- MICHAEL, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
- I MADE A DEAL.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.687
- NO.

02:41.395 --> 02:45.399
[crowd shouting]

02:54.875 --> 02:56.877
- [speaking Spanish]

03:50.230 --> 03:51.365
- YOU'RE DONE, PAL.

03:51.399 --> 03:54.201
YOU GIVE NEW MEANING
TO THE WORD "DESPISED."

03:54.234 --> 03:57.070
IN ADDITION TO YOUR
IMPRESSIVE LIST OF FELONIES,

03:57.104 --> 04:01.642
YOU JUST BROUGHT DOWN ONE OF
THE MOST RESPECTED CIA OFFICERS

04:01.675 --> 04:03.076
LANGLEY EVERY PRODUCED.

04:03.110 --> 04:07.548
THE CIA, THE NSA,
THE NCTC, EVERYBODY,

04:07.581 --> 04:10.050
EVERY INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION

04:10.083 --> 04:12.553
IS CALLING
FOR YOUR HEAD ON A PIKE,

04:12.586 --> 04:13.954
WHICH MEANS
YOU GET TO LOOK FORWARD

04:13.987 --> 04:17.658
TO SPENDING THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE IN A DARK HOLE.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.427
AND NOT JUST YOU, MICHAEL.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.729
SEE YOUR FRIENDS THERE?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.731
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LIVE OUT
THE REST OF YOUR DAYS

04:23.764 --> 04:27.234
IN A COLD, CONCRETE BOX, BUT
DO YOU REALLY THINK THEY CAN?

04:27.267 --> 04:31.138
THEY'RE NEVER
GONNA SEE THE SUN AGAIN.

04:31.171 --> 04:36.276
IN SHORT, MY FRIEND,
YOU'RE SCREWED.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.011
BUT GUESS WHAT.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.247
IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.450
BECAUSE I JUST HAPPEN
TO BE IN THE MARKET

04:42.483 --> 04:47.254
FOR SOMEONE JUST LIKE YOU.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.290
[crowd shouting]

05:42.410 --> 05:44.978
WE'RE GOING AFTER THE LEADER
OF A TERRORIST NETWORK

05:45.012 --> 05:47.014
BASED IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.982
WE NEED TO GET SOMEBODY
CLOSE TO THIS BASTARD,

05:49.016 --> 05:51.819
FIND OUT WHAT HE'S UP TO,
AND TAKE HIM DOWN.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.155
NOW I HAVE TR--WE'VE TRIED
FOR YEARS

05:55.188 --> 05:59.727
TO GET SOMEBODY CLOSE TO HIM.

05:59.760 --> 06:04.432
BUT I THINK THAT YOU CAN SUCCEED
WHERE OTHERS HAVE FAILED.

06:04.465 --> 06:09.403
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT YOU USED
TO WORK WITH THIS SON OF A BITCH

06:09.437 --> 06:12.305
BACK IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.835
- [screams]

06:53.914 --> 06:57.284
[crowd chanting in Spanish]

06:57.317 --> 06:59.152
- AND FORTUNATELY,
YOU'VE ALREADY SET UP

06:59.186 --> 07:02.255
A PERFECT COVER I.D. BY STABBING
YOUR OLD AGENCY IN THE BACK

07:02.289 --> 07:04.424
AND TRYING TO BLACKMAIL YOUR WAY
OUT OF IT AND THAT'S--

07:04.458 --> 07:07.628
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEED.

07:07.661 --> 07:12.733
I NEED THE OLD MICHAEL WESTEN
FROM BEFORE THE BURN NOTICE,

07:12.766 --> 07:14.968
BEFORE THIS
EXTENDED MIAMI VACATION,

07:15.002 --> 07:19.439
THE MICHAEL WESTEN THAT GOT
THE JOB DONE NO MATTER WHAT.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.441
SO DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

07:21.475 --> 07:24.612
[crowd chanting in Spanish]

07:28.516 --> 07:32.553
[cheering]

07:47.300 --> 07:49.169
- A DEEP COVER JOB CHANGES YOU

07:49.202 --> 07:52.039
IN WAYS
THAT ARE HARD TO DESCRIBE.

07:52.072 --> 07:55.142
TO BECOME ANOTHER MAN
FOR MONTHS OR YEARS,

07:55.175 --> 07:56.777
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GO THROUGH

07:56.810 --> 08:00.047
AND NOT BE AFFECTED
AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.615
IN A WAY, THAT'S THE POINT.

08:01.649 --> 08:05.018
DEEP COVER IS ONLY USED
TO GO AFTER THE HARDEST TARGETS.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.987
THE ONES WHO
CAN'T BE APPROACHED.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.723
THE ONES WHO CAN SEE
THROUGH THE SMOOTH LIE.

08:09.757 --> 08:14.127
THE ONES WHO KNOW
THE REAL THING WHEN THEY SEE IT.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.463
THE ONLY WAY IN
WITH A TARGET LIKE THAT

08:16.496 --> 08:20.133
IS TO BECOME THE REAL THING.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.871
EVERY HOUR, EVERY DAY, WHETHER
YOU'RE IN PUBLIC OR ALONE,

08:23.904 --> 08:25.505
YOU HAVE TO LIVE THE LIFE

08:25.539 --> 08:29.543
OF THE MAN
YOU'RE CLAIMING TO BE.

08:29.577 --> 08:32.379
IT CREEPS INTO YOUR SOUL
AFTER A WHILE.

08:32.412 --> 08:35.816
SPEND ENOUGH TIME
POSING AS AN ALCOHOLIC EX-SPY

08:35.849 --> 08:38.385
COMMITTING THE OCCASIONAL
CRIME TO PAY THE RENT

08:38.418 --> 08:42.322
AND THE LINE BETWEEN FICTION
AND FACT BECOMES BLURRY.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.758
EVENTUALLY, THE QUESTION ISN'T

08:44.792 --> 08:47.661
WHETHER THE COVER I.D.
WILL ATTRACT THE TARGET.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.496
IT'S WHETHER THERE
WILL BE ENOUGH OF YOU LEFT

08:49.529 --> 08:52.532
TO COMPLETE THE MISSION
WHEN IT DOES.

09:10.117 --> 09:15.856
[all speaking Spanish]

09:15.889 --> 09:17.925
- NO, GRINGO.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.794
THIS TIME YOU FIGHT FOR FREE.

09:20.828 --> 09:23.030
- IS THIS ABOUT MARQUEZ?

09:23.063 --> 09:25.465
'CAUSE IF HE'S ASKING
FOR MORE MONEY,

09:25.498 --> 09:27.735
THEN YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TAKE IT UP WITH HIM.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.380
- BEEN A LONG TIME.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.916
- BURKE?

09:42.950 --> 09:44.718
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:44.752 --> 09:47.387
- ENJOYING
THE SANTO DOMINGO SUNSHINE.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.623
LOOKING UP OLD FRIENDS.

09:49.657 --> 09:50.891
YOU OKAY?

09:50.924 --> 09:52.893
- YEAH, I'LL BE FINE.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.227
- GOOD.
GET HIM TO THE HOSPITAL.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.630
MICHAEL AND I HAVE SOME
CATCHING UP TO DO, DON'T WE?

09:56.664 --> 09:58.932
- RANDALL BURKE, WHAT'S IT BEEN?
TEN YEARS?

09:58.966 --> 10:00.567
- SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.469
- MOST PEOPLE, WHEN THEY'RE
LOOKING TO GET BACK IN TOUCH,

10:02.502 --> 10:04.237
DON'T SEND GUYS WITH BLADES.

10:04.271 --> 10:07.007
- NOTHING PERSONAL, NICK.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.442
JUST WANTED TO SEE IF YOU COULD
STILL HANDLE YOURSELF.

10:09.476 --> 10:10.944
- WHY'S THAT?

10:10.978 --> 10:13.080
- I GOT A JOB COMING UP.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.748
I WAS HOPING
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT FOR IT.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.116
- WELL, NOW YOU KNOW.

10:16.149 --> 10:19.586
- MAYBE.
MAYBE NOT.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.289
- SEEMS TO ME THE LAST TIME
WE SAW EACH OTHER,

10:22.322 --> 10:25.425
I WAS DRAGGING YOUR ASS
OUT OF A FIREFIGHT IN DAGESTAN.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.593
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

10:26.626 --> 10:27.661
- LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY,
BROTHER.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.930
- I'M THAT SAME GUY.
- ARE YOU?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.431
- [coughs]

10:31.464 --> 10:32.632
- YOU SEE, THE THING
ABOUT THAT GUY, MIKE,

10:32.666 --> 10:34.301
IS HE HAD A FIRE INSIDE.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.535
BACK THEN, YOU WERE CAPABLE
OF THINGS

10:35.568 --> 10:37.871
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WERE POSSIBLE.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.039
THIS GUY?

10:39.072 --> 10:40.941
WHAT, ARE YOU GETTING DRUNK
BEFORE NOON?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.142
COME ON.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.844
- EVERYBODY HITS
A LOW PATCH NOW AND THEN,

10:43.877 --> 10:45.145
BUT I'M STILL IN THE GAME.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.680
TOOK CARE OF YOUR TWO GUYS,
DIDN'T I?

10:46.714 --> 10:49.182
- THAT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
TO THE MICHAEL I KNEW.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.517
- WHAT, THIS?

10:50.550 --> 10:51.651
OH, COME ON, IT'S A SCRATCH.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.220
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.622
FIRST JOB, HALF OFF.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.290
I'LL CALL IT THE FRIENDS
AND FAMILY DISCOUNT.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.792
- IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE MONEY, MIKE.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.528
- WELL, THEN WHAT'S IT ABOUT?
BECAUSE I WANT A JOB.

11:01.561 --> 11:04.497
BURKE, I NEED A JOB.
- WE'LL SEE.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.233
- I DON'T WANNA SEE.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.269
I KNOW--I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.975
- YOU SHOULD
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.477
- BURKE?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.512
TO OLD FRIENDS?

11:32.926 --> 11:35.929
[cheers and applause]

11:39.933 --> 11:41.835
- TELL ME ABOUT
YOUR MEETING WITH BURKE.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.271
DO WE HAVE LIFTOFF?

11:44.304 --> 11:45.605
- NO, HE'S FEELING ME OUT.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.707
- FEELING YOU OUT?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

11:47.741 --> 11:51.511
- HE'S INTERESTED, BUT HE THINKS
I MIGHT HAVE LOST MY EDGE.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.847
- ANY CHANCE YOUR
NONSTOP BOOZE-A-THON

11:53.881 --> 11:57.184
HAS GIVEN HIM SECOND THOUGHTS?

11:57.217 --> 12:01.388
I WARNED YOU NOT TO TAKE
THAT DEAD END ACT TOO FAR.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.689
- BURKE WON'T BELIEVE

12:02.722 --> 12:04.792
A TOP SHELF OPERATIVE
FELL INTO HIS LAP.

12:04.825 --> 12:08.361
HE'S GOTTA THINK I'M DAMAGED
GOODS OR THE STORY FALLS APART.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.197
- WELL, YOU BETTER HOPE SO
'CAUSE THE CLOCK IS TICKING.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.198
IF HE WALKS AWAY--

12:11.231 --> 12:12.299
- I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING, STRONG.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.434
STOP SECOND GUESSING ME
FROM THE SIDELINES.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.904
- SIDELINES?
[chuckles]

12:16.937 --> 12:20.373
WESTEN, THIS INVESTIGATION HAS
TAKEN UP EIGHT YEARS OF MY LIFE,

12:20.407 --> 12:22.075
IT'S DRAGGED ME ACROSS
THREE CONTINENTS,

12:22.109 --> 12:24.544
AND IT ENDED MY MARRIAGE.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.047
AND WHAT DOES IT ALL
ADD UP TO?

12:27.080 --> 12:30.217
YOU, MY FRIEND.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.218
- I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.719
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.387
MY END OF THE DEAL
WAS TO SAVE YOUR FRIENDS.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.724
YOUR END WAS TO TAKE BURKE DOWN,
NOT DO THE BEST YOU CAN.

12:37.757 --> 12:38.992
AND THAT MEANS
YOU DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

12:39.026 --> 12:42.863
YOU UNDERSTAND?

12:50.270 --> 12:53.173
- FOR A SPY OPERATING
UNDER A COVER I.D.,

12:53.206 --> 12:55.976
SECURITY OPTIONS ARE LIMITED.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.677
YOU CAN'T EXACTLY HIRE A GUARD

12:57.710 --> 12:59.813
OR INSTALL
AN EXPENSIVE ALARM SYSTEM

12:59.847 --> 13:01.815
IF YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE BARELY SCRAPING BY.

13:01.849 --> 13:04.651
THAT MEANS YOU
HAVE TO IMPROVISE.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.619
CONNECTING A MOTION SENSOR
IN YOUR APARTMENT

13:06.653 --> 13:09.422
TO A PORCH LIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE,
CAN PROTECT YOUR HOME

13:09.456 --> 13:10.924
AND PROTECT YOUR IDENTITY.

13:10.958 --> 13:14.527
IT'S ALSO A GOOD IDEA
TO FIND A PLACE YOU CAN GET INTO

13:14.561 --> 13:16.463
WITHOUT USING THE FRONT DOOR.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.266
MOST PEOPLE DON'T GO LOOKING
FOR SECOND FLOOR APARTMENTS

13:19.299 --> 13:21.101
WITH WINDOWS FACING AN ALLEY,

13:21.134 --> 13:24.071
BUT IN A PINCH,
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.841
WOW, YOU REALLY DON'T LEARN.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.143
YOU WERE THE ONE
WITH THE KNIFE IN THE ALLEY.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.012
- RELAX, MICHAEL.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.646
NOBODY'S HERE TO HURT YOU.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.650
YOU KNOW, MICHAEL,
I ALMOST DIDN'T COME TONIGHT.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.286
PABLO MADE A PRETTY GOOD CASE.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.788
FINDING AN OPERATIVE LIKE YOU
COOLING HIS HEELS IN THE D.R.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.356
IS ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.992
- GLAD TO KNOW I HAVE A FAN.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.726
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:46.759 --> 13:48.395
- I'VE GOT A SOFT SPOT
FOR OLD FRIENDS, MIKE.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.163
- TELL ME ABOUT THE JOB.
I'M READY.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.464
- SLOW DOWN.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.166
WE GOTTA MAKE SURE
YOU'RE UP TO THE TASK FIRST.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.368
- WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

13:55.402 --> 13:58.305
- IT MEANS YOU'RE DONE
WITH THIS LIGHTER FLUID.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.641
[liquid pours]

14:01.674 --> 14:04.611
YOU'RE CLEAN STARTING NOW.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.083
- COLD TURKEY.
[chuckles]

14:10.117 --> 14:11.985
UH, I CAN'T DO THAT.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.320
- OH, BUT YOU CAN.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.687
YOU JUST SIGNED UP

14:14.721 --> 14:17.757
FOR THE WORLD'S MOST EFFECTIVE
DETOX PROGRAM, MIKE.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.826
YOU TAKE ONE MORE DRINK,

14:19.859 --> 14:22.729
I PUT A BULLET IN THE BACK
OF YOUR HEAD.

14:22.762 --> 14:26.766
- HUH, THAT'S A LITTLE EXTREME,
DON'T YOU THINK?

14:28.768 --> 14:30.904
- LET ME MAKE ONE THING
PERFECTLY CLEAR.

14:30.938 --> 14:33.106
I'M NOT JUST OFFERING YOU
A NEW JOB.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.008
I'M OFFERING YOU
A NEW LIFE, MICHAEL.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.677
BUT IN THIS NEW LIFE,
THERE'S NO SECOND CHANCES.

14:37.710 --> 14:41.714
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
- YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.190
[upbeat music]

14:50.223 --> 14:58.298
*

15:00.433 --> 15:01.568
- OH, JAVI.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.036
JUST THE GUY I WANT TO SEE.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.372
DID YOU TALK TO THE CATERER
FOR ELSA'S PARTY

15:05.405 --> 15:06.739
FOR THE BIRTHDAY THING?

15:06.773 --> 15:08.775
DID YOU GUYS GET THE CAKE?
- YES, THEY DELIVER IT TUESDAY.

15:08.808 --> 15:09.876
SO THERE'S THIS, UM--

15:09.909 --> 15:11.711
- OKAY, BUT SHE
DOESN'T KNOW, RIGHT?

15:11.744 --> 15:14.314
I MEAN, LOOK, I'M COUNTING
ON YOU HERE, OKAY?

15:14.347 --> 15:15.715
THIS IS A COVERT OP,
MY FRIEND.

15:15.748 --> 15:16.716
THIS IS TOP SECRET.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.051
- OF COURSE.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.120
I, UH--ACTUALLY,
I CAME OVER

15:20.153 --> 15:22.222
BECAUSE THERE'S A MAN WAITING
FOR YOU IN THE MEMBER'S LOUNGE.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.556
HE SAYS IT'S IMPORTANT.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.924
IT'S CONCERNING
A FRIEND OF YOURS.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.260
A MICHAEL WESTEN?

15:27.294 --> 15:30.063
- JEAN FOURNIER,
DIRECTION GENERALE

15:30.097 --> 15:32.532
DE LA SECURITE EXTERIEURE.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.439
SO YOU'RE FRENCH INTEL?
- YES.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.441
THANK YOU
FOR MEETING WITH ME.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.110
- OH, IT'S NO PROBLEM, BUT I
GOTTA BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.744
I HAVEN'T SEEN MIKE
SINCE LAST YEAR.

15:44.777 --> 15:49.116
- OH, WELL, PERHAPS IT'S WORTH
A DISCUSSION IN ANY CASE.

15:49.149 --> 15:54.121
IT IS A MATTER
OF GREAT IMPORTANCE.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.189
MY AGENCY HAS BEEN RUNNING
A MISSION

15:56.223 --> 15:59.592
IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND
YOUR FRIEND MONSIEUR WESTEN

15:59.626 --> 16:01.428
HAS BEEN OBSERVED WORKING
WITH SOME MEN

16:01.461 --> 16:04.097
THAT WE BELIEVE
TO BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.832
NOW WE NEED
VERY URGENTLY TO KNOW

16:05.865 --> 16:08.768
IF HE IS THERE
ON OFFICIAL BUSINESS.

16:08.801 --> 16:12.639
- LOOK, I GOT NO CLUE
WHAT MIKE IS UP TO.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.041
I MEAN, WHY YOU COMING TO ME?

16:14.074 --> 16:15.875
- LAST RESORT, I'M AFRAID.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.944
WE'VE CONTACTED
OUR FRIENDS AT THE CIA,

16:17.977 --> 16:18.978
BUT...
[scoffs]

16:19.012 --> 16:20.513
THEY WILL TELL US NOTHING.

16:20.547 --> 16:25.285
- WELL, THEN THERE'S
YOUR ANSWER.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.787
- MONSIEUR AXE, YOUR FRIEND'S
LIFE IS IN DANGER.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.390
IF WESTEN IS CIA,
WE DO ONE THING.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.958
IF HE'S NOT,
WE DO SOMETHING ELSE.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.827
EITHER WAY, IF YOU TELL US
THE TRUTH, WE CAN PROTECT HIM.

16:34.861 --> 16:37.564
- OKAY, LOOK, HAVE YOU
SPOKEN WITH HENRI LABELLE?

16:37.597 --> 16:39.299
I WORKED WITH HIM BACK IN '98

16:39.332 --> 16:41.134
WHEN HE RAN COUNTER-INTEL
FOR YOU GUYS.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.469
HE'S PRETTY TIGHT
WITH LANGLEY TOO.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.536
- WELL, YES, OF COURSE.

16:43.570 --> 16:48.375
HENRI TRIED HIS BEST, BUT--

16:48.408 --> 16:51.844
HMM.

16:51.878 --> 16:54.081
CLEVER...

16:54.114 --> 16:58.551
MONSIEUR AXE.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.520
THERE'S NO REAL LABELLE,
IS THERE?

17:00.553 --> 17:03.190
- WHY YOU ASKING QUESTIONS
ABOUT MIKE?

17:03.223 --> 17:05.592
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU, PAL?

17:05.625 --> 17:08.561
- I'M THE MAN WITH A KNIFE
TO YOUR FEMORAL ARTERY.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.938
LET ME GO...

17:18.971 --> 17:24.077
OR YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S BEAUTIFUL
PLACE WILL GET VERY BLOODY.

17:31.818 --> 17:35.355
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,
MONSIEUR AXE.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.390
AU REVOIR.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.598
- JESSE! HEY, JESSE.
- SAM?

17:45.632 --> 17:46.699
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
CALL YOU BACK.

17:46.733 --> 17:47.867
I'M A TERRIBLE FRIEND.
- YEAH, YOU ARE.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.935
- I OWE YOU 1/2 JILLION MOJITOS.
- YEAH, YOU DO.

17:48.968 --> 17:49.936
- BUT THIS
IS THE WORST TIME EVER.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.070
- THIS CAN'T WAIT.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.206
- SAM, I CAN'T
DO THIS RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

17:53.240 --> 17:54.407
OUR SYSTEM WAS HACKED TODAY.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.875
- RIGHT, AND I'M SURE
THIS FINE YOUNG MAN

17:55.908 --> 17:57.377
CAN HELP YOU FIX IT LATER.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.545
WE GOTTA TALK.
- NO, NO, NO.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.579
NICK.
- COME ON, EGG MAN.

17:59.612 --> 18:00.780
- NICK, YOU STAY RIGHT THERE.
- NICK--

18:00.813 --> 18:01.781
- NICK, STAY.
- NICK, IT'S OKAY, BUDDY.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.049
TIME FOR A TEN-MINUTE BREAK.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.985
THANK YOU, SIR.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.155
- WHAT?

18:08.188 --> 18:09.556
- I'M AFRAID MIKE'S
IN TROUBLE.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.057
- YOU HEARD FROM MIKE?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.092
- NO, BUT A GUY TRIED
TO STAB ME

18:13.126 --> 18:14.794
WHO CAME OVER
ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.896
- ASKING QUESTIONS--

18:16.929 --> 18:18.498
AUSTRALIAN GUY?
GLASSES?

18:18.531 --> 18:19.799
- WELL, HE HAD GLASSES,
BUT THIS GUY SAID

18:19.832 --> 18:21.401
HE WAS WITH FRENCH INTELLIGENCE.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.502
- DID HE?
- YEAH.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.970
- MY GUY SAID HE WAS
IN THE DIAMOND BUSINESS.

18:24.003 --> 18:26.005
SAID HE WAS LOOKING
FOR A BODYGUARD WITH SKILLS.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.474
HE ASKED ME
IF I STILL WORKED WITH MIKE.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.409
- WELL, THEN IT'S THE SAME GUY,
JUST A DIFFERENT COVER I.D.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.944
- THINGS ARE STARTING
TO MAKE A LITTLE MORE SENSE NOW.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.513
OUR SYSTEM WENT DOWN
LIKE FIVE MINUTES

18:33.546 --> 18:35.782
AFTER THAT GUY
LEFT THE BUILDING.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.317
- WAIT, ARE YOU SAYING
THAT GUY'S YOUR HACKER?

18:37.350 --> 18:38.618
- HE'S GOTTA BE.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.086
ONLY QUESTION IS, WHAT THE HELL
DOES HE WANT WITH MIKE?

18:40.119 --> 18:42.189
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S TIME
TO CIRCLE THE WAGONS.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.760
[phone rings]

18:47.794 --> 18:49.429
- I'M A LITTLE BUSY
RIGHT NOW, SAM.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.598
- YEAH, FI, LOOK,
NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

18:51.631 --> 18:53.500
I NEED YOU TO PUT THAT
ON HOLD FOR A SECOND, OKAY?

18:53.533 --> 18:55.768
I NEED YOU TO MEET ME
AND JESSE AT CARLITO'S AND--

18:55.802 --> 18:56.803
- CAN'T PUT IT ON HOLD.

18:56.836 --> 18:57.870
I'M ON A JOB.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.639
I'M BRINGING IN A SKIP.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.140
- CAN'T CARLOS
HANDLE THIS HIMSELF?

19:01.174 --> 19:02.442
- UH-UH.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.277
THIS IS A SERIOUS
SIX-FIGURE BAD GUY.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.778
- YOU'RE GONNA WANNA STOP
RUNNING RIGHT NOW!

19:05.812 --> 19:07.547
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN!
- I'M NOT GOIN' BACK TO JAIL!

19:07.580 --> 19:09.682
- YOU'RE GONNA REGRET THAT
IN ABOUT THREE SECONDS!

19:09.716 --> 19:10.783
THREE!

19:10.817 --> 19:12.952
- COME ON,
CARLOS IS A BIG BOY, OKAY?

19:12.985 --> 19:14.287
HE CAN HANDLE THIS SOLO.
- TWO!

19:14.321 --> 19:16.989
- GOTTA GO, SAM.

19:17.023 --> 19:19.959
ONE.
- [grunts]

19:19.992 --> 19:23.296
YOU BITCH.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.297
- AW, NOW, NOW.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.965
IT'S JUST A BEANBAG ROUND.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.500
AND THAT'S NO WAY
TO TALK TO A LADY.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.503
- STAY DOWN.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.539
- ARE YOU OKAY?

19:39.912 --> 19:42.081
- I'M BETTER.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.150
[headset beeps]
WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S UP?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.151
- SAM KEEPS CALLING ME.

19:45.184 --> 19:50.089
THIS BETTER BE IMPORTANT.

19:50.122 --> 19:53.893
IF I HAD KNOWN THIS WAS ABOUT
MICHAEL, I WOULDN'T HAVE COME.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.162
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN
NINE MONTHS, NEITHER HAVE YOU.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.431
I HAVE A LIFE NOW.

19:58.465 --> 20:01.234
I HAVE A NEW HOUSE,
A NEW BUSINESS, A NEW MAN.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.835
- WE TOTALLY FEEL YOU, FI.

20:02.869 --> 20:03.903
WE TOTALLY FEEL YOU.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.171
SAM AND I ARE GONNA HANDLE IT.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.606
WE'RE GONNA RUN
THE MYSTERY GUY DOWN.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.508
WE ALREADY GOT HIS PLATES FROM
THE SECURITY CAMERAS AT WORK.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.743
- ALL WE'RE ASKING IS FOR YOU
TO JUST KEEP AN EYE ON MADDY.

20:10.777 --> 20:11.778
THAT'S IT.
- THAT'S IT.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.180
- SHE HAS ENOUGH
ON HER MIND RIGHT NOW.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.249
CHARLIE'S CUSTODY HEARING
IS TOMORROW.

20:16.283 --> 20:17.584
- CHARLIE?

20:17.617 --> 20:19.286
MADDY'S GETTING CUSTODY
OF NATE'S KID?

20:19.319 --> 20:22.188
DID I MISS SOMETHING?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.591
YOU GUYS DON'T TELL ME
ANYTHING, SERIOUSLY.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.359
- RUTH FELL OFF THE WAGON.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.627
SHE'S IN REHAB.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.961
SHE'S NOT FIT TO BE A MOTHER.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.697
- ALL THE MORE REASON
TO FIGURE OUT WHO THIS GUY IS

20:30.730 --> 20:32.098
AND WHAT HE WANTS,
'CAUSE LIKE IT OR NOT,

20:32.131 --> 20:33.700
MIKE'S ENEMIES
ARE OUR ENEMIES.

20:33.733 --> 20:34.967
- FINE.

20:35.001 --> 20:38.004
BUT I'M DOING THIS
FOR MADELINE.

20:45.445 --> 20:48.047
- THE CONCEPT
OF ONLY SHARING INFORMATION

20:48.080 --> 20:49.549
THAT OPERATIVES NEED TO KNOW

20:49.582 --> 20:52.552
ISN'T JUST USED
BY INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.722
TERRORISTS USE IT TOO
FOR THE SAME REASONS.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.724
IT'S A CHALLENGE
WHEN YOU'RE INFILTRATING

20:57.757 --> 20:59.926
A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION
BECAUSE IT MEANS

20:59.959 --> 21:02.395
YOU DON'T GET TO KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE PART OF

21:02.429 --> 21:04.497
UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

21:04.531 --> 21:05.732
THIS IS INSANE.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.600
YOU WANT ME TO PLAN CHARGES
IN A BUILDING

21:07.634 --> 21:08.768
I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.337
- NOW YOU'VE SEEN IT.

21:10.370 --> 21:14.240
- NO, WHAT I SEE IS A PLACE
CRAWLING WITH SECURITY.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.509
- THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S A SECURITY FIRM, MICHAEL.

21:16.543 --> 21:19.946
DEFENSE CONTRACTOR TOO.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.449
THINK OF IT AS A LATIN AMERICAN
VERSION OF BLACKWATER.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.783
- OH, BLACKWATER.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.117
YEAH, AND WE'RE GONNA GO
IN THERE ALONE.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.118
THAT SOUNDS SAFE.

21:26.152 --> 21:27.253
- THAT'S WHY HE'S HERE.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.421
HE USED TO WORK WITH THEM.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.089
HE KNOWS HIS WAY AROUND.
HE'LL GET YOU IN.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.326
- I DON'T SEE ANY GUARD LOGS,
EMPLOYEE COUNTS,

21:33.360 --> 21:34.827
NO POLICE RESPONSE TIMES.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.696
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT THIS DONE
RIGHT, I NEED MORE TIME.

21:36.729 --> 21:40.099
- MICHAEL, CONSIDER THIS A TEST

21:40.132 --> 21:42.702
OF YOUR ABILITY TO OPERATE
UNDER CHALLENGING CONDITIONS.

21:42.735 --> 21:45.037
NOW YOU TWO ARE GONNA
ENTER THE BUILDING

21:45.071 --> 21:48.274
AS WEEKEND PRACTITIONERS
OF THE CUSTODIAL ARTS.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.277
YOU'LL HAVE KEY CARDS THAT'LL
GET YOU PAST THE GUARDS.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.613
ONCE YOU'RE INSIDE,
PABLO WILL DIRECT YOU

21:53.646 --> 21:57.617
TO A HIGH SECURITY ROOM
ON THE EAST END OF THE BUILDING.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.285
- AND THAT'S WHERE
WE PLANT THE CHARGES?

21:59.318 --> 22:00.953
- EXACTLY.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.288
FROM THERE, YOU'LL MAKE
YOUR WAY OUT BACK.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.357
THERE'LL BE A VEHICLE
WAITING FOR YOU.

22:04.391 --> 22:05.692
IF YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE
AT THAT POINT,

22:05.725 --> 22:06.893
I'LL BE UP THERE TO COVER YOU.

22:06.926 --> 22:07.960
- YEAH, YOU STILL
HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING

22:07.994 --> 22:09.529
ABOUT WHAT THIS JOB IS.

22:09.562 --> 22:13.633
WE'RE BLOWING SOMETHING UP,
BUT WHAT IS THAT THING?

22:13.666 --> 22:15.535
WHY ARE WE BLOWING IT UP?
WHY CAN'T--

22:15.568 --> 22:16.636
- YOU ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.137
- AND MAYBE
YOU DON'T ASK ENOUGH.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.306
EITHER YOU'RE CRAZY
OR YOU'RE TOO DUMB TO CARE.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.874
- HEY!
LISTEN TO ME.

22:21.908 --> 22:25.144
THIS MAN IS ONE OF
THE BRAVEST MEN I'VE EVER MET.

22:25.177 --> 22:29.215
HE HAS RISKED HIS LIFE FOR ME
MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT.

22:29.248 --> 22:31.784
YOU WILL TREAT HIM
WITH THE RESPECT HE DESERVES.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.822
I KNOW YOU HAVE QUESTIONS

22:35.855 --> 22:37.524
AND YOU'LL GET
YOUR ANSWERS EVENTUALLY.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.992
BUT THAT TIME IS NOT NOW.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.529
I BROUGHT MICHAEL ON
FOR A REASON.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.597
YOU ARE TO TREAT HIM
LIKE A MEMBER OF THIS TEAM.

22:44.631 --> 22:48.501
YOU UNDERSTAND?

22:48.535 --> 22:50.069
GOOD.

22:50.102 --> 22:53.105
WE'RE ON IN THREE HOURS.

23:07.286 --> 23:09.856
- ONE, TWO, WE'RE UP, WE'RE UP.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.359
CHARLIE WESTEN SLAMS ONE DOWN
AND THE CROWD GOES WILD.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.428
- FIONA, PUT THAT THING AWAY.

23:15.462 --> 23:17.363
- MADELINE, I TOLD YOU
WE HAVE A SITUATION.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.065
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
WE HAVE A SITUATION.

23:19.098 --> 23:22.234
CHILD SERVICES COULD MAKE
A HOME VISIT AT ANY TIME.

23:22.268 --> 23:25.037
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
I QUIT SMOKING FOR THIS.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.973
ONE GUN COULD RUIN EVERYTHING.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.208
- IT'S JUST UNTIL
SAM AND JESSE FIND THIS GUY.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.043
- WHY DON'T WE JUST
CALL THE POLICE?

23:31.077 --> 23:32.945
- WE WILL
TAKE CARE OF IT OURSELVES

23:32.979 --> 23:35.414
JUST LIKE WE ALWAYS DO.

23:35.448 --> 23:38.485
- THAT CHILD LOST
BOTH HIS PARENTS.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.487
I WILL NOT LET HIM LOSE ME.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.321
- LET US WORRY ABOUT
ANY DANGER.

23:42.354 --> 23:44.557
YOU JUST WORRY ABOUT MAKING SURE
YOU GET TO KEEP CHARLIE.

23:44.591 --> 23:45.558
- THERE WE GO.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.259
OH, OH, THERE HE GOES.

23:47.293 --> 23:50.396
[phone rings]

23:50.429 --> 23:52.899
- IT'S JESSE.
I GOTTA TAKE IT.

23:52.932 --> 23:57.504
- TELL HIM
TO FIND THAT GUY ALREADY.

23:57.537 --> 23:58.505
- ANY LUCK?

23:58.538 --> 24:00.306
- OH, NO LUCK.
ALL SKILL.

24:00.339 --> 24:01.674
I RAN THE GUY'S PLATES.

24:01.708 --> 24:02.775
HE WAS DRIVING A RENTAL.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.477
NAME ON THE CREDIT CARD
WAS JACK MARSDEN.

24:04.511 --> 24:05.745
- WELL, THAT CAN'T BE
HIS REAL NAME.

24:05.778 --> 24:06.779
- WELL, OF COURSE NOT.

24:06.813 --> 24:07.814
AND HE ONLY USED THE CARD ONCE.

24:07.847 --> 24:08.848
BUT HERE'S WHY I'M A GENIUS.

24:08.881 --> 24:09.982
I CHECKED ALL THE OTHER CARDS

24:10.016 --> 24:11.584
ISSUED BY THAT COMPANY
THE SAME DAY.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.453
FOUND A J.P. MARSDEN
WHO JUST USED A BRAND-NEW CARD

24:14.487 --> 24:15.922
TO RENT A HOUSE
IN COCONUT GROVE.

24:15.955 --> 24:16.989
A-BAM.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.157
- YOU THINK
HE STILL LIVES THERE?

24:18.190 --> 24:21.761
- SAM AND I ARE HEADING
OVER THERE RIGHT NOW.

24:21.794 --> 24:25.264
- SMUGGLING ANYTHING
INTO A SECURE BUILDING

24:25.297 --> 24:27.500
IS ALL ABOUT MISDIRECTION.

24:27.534 --> 24:30.803
YOU CAN'T KEEP ALARMS FROM
GOING OFF OR DOGS FROM BARKING,

24:30.837 --> 24:32.805
BUT YOU CAN MASK
WHY IT'S HAPPENING.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.807
- [speaking Spanish]

24:34.841 --> 24:37.176
- A METAL DETECTOR
CAN'T DIFFERENTIATE

24:37.209 --> 24:39.445
BETWEEN A SMITH & WESSON .45

24:39.478 --> 24:44.116
AND A STEEL-SIDED
FLOOR POLISHER...

24:44.150 --> 24:45.484
[dog panting]

24:45.518 --> 24:47.787
THE SAME WAY A BOMB-SNIFFING
GERMAN SHEPHERD

24:47.820 --> 24:50.690
DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE SMELL OF C-4

24:50.723 --> 24:52.659
AND NITROGEN-BASED FERTILIZERS.

24:52.692 --> 24:57.564
[all speaking Spanish]

25:07.874 --> 25:09.876
WE'RE AT THE DOOR.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.152
- REAR EXIT'S CLEAR.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.554
YOU'VE GOT THREE MINUTES

25:21.588 --> 25:23.656
BEFORE THAT PATROL CAR
CIRCLES AROUND AGAIN.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.491
- COPY THAT.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.828
[keypad beeps]

25:28.861 --> 25:31.898
[error tone]

25:31.931 --> 25:33.566
[keypad beeps]

25:33.600 --> 25:34.667
DAMN IT.
[error tone]

25:34.701 --> 25:35.935
- DID YOU GET THE WRONG CODE?

25:35.968 --> 25:37.169
- NO, THIS WAS RIGHT.

25:37.203 --> 25:40.272
THEY MUST HAVE CHANGED IT.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.552
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:53.586 --> 25:56.255
- WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE A GUARD,
GET IT FROM HIM.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.858
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR AN INTERROGATION.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.526
WE'LL USE THE EXPLOSIVE.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.061
WE'LL GET THROUGH THE DOOR
WITH A CUTTING CHARGE.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.863
- WE'VE ONLY GOT ONE DETONATOR.

26:03.896 --> 26:04.964
- LET ME HANDLE THAT.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.398
JUST COVER ME.

26:06.432 --> 26:08.735
PABLO, PLEASE.
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

26:08.768 --> 26:12.404
- FINE, BUT DO IT QUICKLY.

26:12.438 --> 26:16.042
- C-4 IS THE MOST POPULAR
MILITARY EXPLOSIVE

26:16.075 --> 26:18.077
MAINLY BECAUSE
IT'S EXTREMELY STABLE.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.713
THAT'S GREAT IF SAFETY
IS YOUR MAIN CONCERN,

26:20.747 --> 26:23.382
BUT NOT SO GREAT
IF YOU'RE SHORT A DETONATOR.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.884
WHEN YOU HAVE TO IMPROVISE,

26:24.917 --> 26:27.453
A PRIMARY EXPLOSIVE
LIKE MERCURY FULMINATE

26:27.486 --> 26:30.222
MIXED WITH GUNPOWDER
CAN PROVIDE THE ENERGY NEEDED

26:30.256 --> 26:31.791
TO SET OFF A CHUNK OF C-4,

26:31.824 --> 26:33.726
PROVIDED YOU CAN
GET THEM IN PLACE

26:33.760 --> 26:38.297
WITHOUT BLOWING YOUR HAND OFF.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.966
HERE.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.734
BURKE, CHANGE OF PLANS.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.069
WE'RE COMING OUT HOT.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.070
- COPY THAT.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.773
I'LL BE READY WHEN YOU DO.

26:52.544 --> 26:55.848
[alarm blares]

26:58.885 --> 27:02.789
- [yelling in Spanish]

27:02.822 --> 27:05.825
[bomb beeps]

27:05.858 --> 27:07.159
[yelling in Spanish]

27:07.193 --> 27:09.361
- TIME TO GO!

27:09.395 --> 27:13.332
- WE HAVE TO MOVE, NOW.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.201
[grunts]

27:15.234 --> 27:16.869
[bomb beeps]

27:16.903 --> 27:18.905
- DAMN IT.

27:21.140 --> 27:25.344
[bomb beeps]

27:43.662 --> 27:47.266
[gunfire]

27:52.338 --> 27:53.973
- GONNA MEET UP IN TWO HOURS.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.842
CHANGE CLOTHES AND SWITCH CARS.

27:55.875 --> 28:00.546
RADIO SILENCE UNTIL THEN.

28:00.579 --> 28:01.948
[gunfire]

28:08.855 --> 28:10.823
- THIS IS THE PLACE.

28:10.857 --> 28:14.160
MATCHES THE ADDRESS
ON THE RENTAL AGREEMENT.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.828
- I DON'T SEE ANY CARS.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.930
PLACE LOOKS EMPTY.
- MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

28:17.964 --> 28:19.031
THERE'S THE BOX.

28:19.065 --> 28:22.701
LET'S SEE IF HE'S HOME.

28:22.735 --> 28:26.839
- AN EASY WAY TO TELL
IF A HOUSE IS OCCUPIED

28:26.873 --> 28:28.841
IS TO MONITOR
THE ELECTRICITY USAGE

28:28.875 --> 28:30.877
WITH A NON-CONTACT
VOLTAGE METER.

28:30.910 --> 28:33.079
YOU CAN DO A QUICK CHECK
OF THE BREAKER BOX

28:33.112 --> 28:35.181
AND SEE IF ANYONE'S
GOT THE LIGHTS ON.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.849
- EITHER HE LIKES TO SIT
SILENTLY IN THE DARK

28:36.883 --> 28:38.885
OR HE'S NOT IN THERE.
- GOOD.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.419
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO
SURPRISING THE SON OF A BITCH

28:40.452 --> 28:42.221
WHEN HE GETS BACK HOME.
- OH, BOY.

28:42.254 --> 28:43.689
YOU'RE A LITTLE FIRED UP
ABOUT THIS ONE, AREN'T YOU?

28:43.722 --> 28:46.959
- HE HELD A SWITCHBLADE TO A
VERY SENSITIVE REGION OF SAM AXE

28:46.993 --> 28:50.196
THAT ONLY ELSA
AND SANDINO GET TO TOUCH.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.798
WHAT?

28:51.831 --> 28:53.766
SANDINO'S MY MASSEUR.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.468
- T.M.I., SAM.
T.M.I.

28:56.502 --> 28:59.806
- ONCE YOU'RE AT THE STRUCTURE
THE NEXT STEP IS GETTING IN.

28:59.839 --> 29:02.108
THE SAME PORTABLE VOLTAGE TESTER

29:02.141 --> 29:04.210
YOU USED TO MEASURE
ELECTRICAL USAGE

29:04.243 --> 29:06.913
CAN ALSO DETECT
ELECTRICAL CURRENTS.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.547
WHICH MEANS,
IF YOU CAN GET CLOSE

29:08.580 --> 29:10.316
TO YOUR TARGET'S
DOORS AND WINDOWS,

29:10.349 --> 29:12.819
YOU CAN TELL IF HE'S GOT
AN ACTIVE ALARM SYSTEM

29:12.852 --> 29:15.855
WITH A WAVE OF YOUR HAND.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.467
- OKAY, WE'RE IN.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.768
- NICE.

29:29.802 --> 29:31.170
[voltage meter beeps]
WAIT, WAIT.

29:31.203 --> 29:33.672
VOLT METER JUST SPIKED.

29:33.705 --> 29:35.074
- I THOUGHT
YOU SCANNED THE DOOR.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.275
- I DID.

29:36.308 --> 29:37.676
I THINK SOMETHING
JUST TURNED ON.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.111
- CAN YOU SEE WHAT IT IS?

29:39.145 --> 29:42.014
- OF COURSE, JUST BECAUSE
THEY DON'T HAVE AN ALARM SYSTEM

29:42.048 --> 29:43.916
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

29:43.950 --> 29:46.118
ABOUT LESS CONVENTIONAL
FORMS OF SECURITY.

29:46.152 --> 29:48.988
- SAM, DON'T MOVE.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.423
DON'T MOVE.
DON'T EVEN BREATHE.

29:51.457 --> 29:52.591
- WHAT IS IT?
- I SAID, "DON'T MOVE"!

29:52.624 --> 29:53.860
- DO YOU SEE THE GUY?

29:53.893 --> 29:55.094
- IT'S A PRETTY SAFE BET
THAT HE'S NOT HOME.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.929
PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY
WIRE A CLAYMORE MINE

29:56.963 --> 29:58.497
TO THEIR FRONT DOOR WHEN
THEY'RE JUST CHILLING INSIDE.

29:58.530 --> 30:01.834
- DID YOU SAY, "CLAYMORE"?
- YEAH.

30:01.868 --> 30:02.869
IT'S ON A REMOTE TRIGGER.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.103
I THINK WE JUST ACTIVATED IT.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.873
- WHAT? HOW?
- STOP! DON'T--[grunts]

30:06.906 --> 30:09.475
IT'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING
IN THE LOCK.

30:09.508 --> 30:12.111
IT'S PROBABLY SET TO GO OFF
WHEN YOU TURN THE KNOB...

30:12.144 --> 30:13.112
OR WHEN YOU LET IT GO.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.313
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

30:14.346 --> 30:15.481
WHEN I TURN THE KNOB
OR LET IT GO?

30:15.514 --> 30:16.482
WHICH IS IT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

30:16.515 --> 30:17.884
JUST DON'T MOVE, DON'T TWITCH,

30:17.917 --> 30:19.852
DON'T BLINK, DON'T...THINK.

30:25.757 --> 30:27.126
- EXCUSE ME.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.128
I'M HERE FOR THE CHARLIE WESTEN
CUSTODY CASE.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.897
- RIGHT THIS WAY.

30:30.930 --> 30:33.832
MR. EMORY IS WAITING FOR YOU
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

30:33.866 --> 30:36.035
- I'M SORRY, I THOUGH I WAS
MEETING WITH MR. COYER.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.469
- ACTUALLY, NO.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.505
A SUPERVISOR
FROM THE STATE OFFICE

30:39.538 --> 30:41.740
CAME EARLY THIS MORNING
TO HANDLE YOUR CASE.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.242
- WHY? IS SOMETHING WRONG?

30:43.275 --> 30:45.377
- NO, NO, IT'S PROBABLY JUST
THAT YOUR CASE IS SENSITIVE.

30:48.614 --> 30:51.383
- AH, MRS. WESTEN.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.319
HI, THERE.
- HELLO.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.487
- I'M WARREN EMORY.

30:55.521 --> 30:56.722
SO GOOD TO MEET YOU.

30:56.755 --> 30:59.791
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.331
- I MUST SAY, MRS. WESTEN,

31:05.364 --> 31:07.733
BASED ON THE REPORTS
THAT I'VE SEEN,

31:07.766 --> 31:10.502
YOU'RE IN GOOD POSITION TO MOVE
FORWARD IN YOUR EFFORTS

31:10.536 --> 31:12.838
TO BECOME YOUR GRANDSON'S
LEGAL GUARDIAN.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.941
- [exhales]
THANK YOU.

31:14.974 --> 31:15.942
I'M SO RELIEVED.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.109
- UNFORTUNATELY
THERE IS AN ISSUE

31:17.143 --> 31:18.210
THAT WE HAVEN'T COVERED

31:18.244 --> 31:20.612
AND WE'RE CONCERNED
IT MAY IMPACT

31:20.646 --> 31:23.449
THE SUITABILITY OF THE HOME
ENVIRONMENT FOR CHARLIE.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.087
SPECIFICALLY YOUR SON MICHAEL.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.689
- MICHAEL?

31:30.722 --> 31:32.691
HE HASN'T--MICHAEL SHOULD NOT
BE AN ISSUE.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.194
I HAVE NO CONTACT WITH HIM.
- HMM.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.862
- I'M SORRY,
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND--

31:36.895 --> 31:38.364
- NO, I UNDERSTAND.
I REALLY DO.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.133
BUT THE DEPARTMENT,
I'M AFRAID THEY WON'T

31:41.167 --> 31:44.903
WITHOUT SOME KIND OF AN IDEA
ABOUT YOUR SON'S CURRENT STATUS.

31:47.773 --> 31:50.309
- I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TALK ABOUT MICHAEL.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.211
- HMM.
- THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.046
- THEN I'M AFRAID
THERE'S NOTHING MORE

31:54.080 --> 31:56.048
THAT WE CAN DO HERE.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.384
I'M SURE WE CAN PLACE CHARLIE
IN A FOSTER CARE--

31:58.417 --> 32:01.353
- NO, PLEASE!

32:04.190 --> 32:07.226
MICHAEL IS WORKING
ON A GOVERNMENT ASSIGNMENT.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.761
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.

32:09.795 --> 32:11.830
- HMM.

32:11.863 --> 32:17.236
IS THIS SOMETHING
YOU CAN, UH, VERIFY?

32:17.269 --> 32:20.072
- NOT EXACTLY,
BUT YOU COULD LOOK UP

32:20.106 --> 32:21.407
MY ARREST RECORDS
FROM LAST YEAR

32:21.440 --> 32:23.075
WHEN I TURNED MYSELF IN
TO THE POLICE.

32:23.109 --> 32:25.411
WE WERE ALL RELEASED--

32:25.444 --> 32:28.814
PART OF A DEAL THAT MICHAEL
HAD MADE WITH THE CIA.

32:30.949 --> 32:34.987
- THAT'S EXCELLENT,
MRS. WESTEN.

32:35.021 --> 32:39.791
I'M GLAD
THAT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS.

32:39.825 --> 32:42.794
NOW, TELL ME MORE
ABOUT THIS DEAL.

32:42.828 --> 32:44.030
- HOW YOU DOING THERE, JESSE?

32:44.063 --> 32:45.697
GETTING A LITTLE WOBBLY HERE.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.466
- NO. NO WOBBLING.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.501
JUST GETTIN' A TOOL.
HANG ON.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.007
- YOU CALL THAT A TOOL?

32:55.041 --> 32:56.108
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
GONNA DO WITH THAT?

32:56.142 --> 32:58.444
- I LEFT MY BOMB ROBOT
AT HOME, SAM.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.012
CAN'T DISARM THE THING.

33:00.046 --> 33:02.614
I'M GONNA TRY TO CHANGE
THE BLAST RADIUS.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.716
[breathes heavily]
OKAY.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.052
CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME ROOM
TO WORK HERE?

33:06.085 --> 33:08.120
I'M A LITTLE CLOSE
TO SANDINO TERRITORY.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.189
- AS I RECALL, YOU TOLD ME
NOT TO MOVE A MUSCLE.

33:10.222 --> 33:11.457
I'M GONNA STICK WITH THAT.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.524
- FAIR ENOUGH.

33:12.558 --> 33:15.394
- CLAYMORE MINES
ARE ONE OF THE MOST LETHAL

33:15.427 --> 33:18.497
ANTI-PERSONNEL DEVICES
IN EXISTENCE.

33:18.530 --> 33:21.167
THE SHRAPNEL INSIDE CAN RIP
THROUGH THE WALL OF A HOUSE

33:21.200 --> 33:24.303
AND STILL BE DEADLY
UP TO 200 METERS.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.504
- OOH.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.906
- BUT BECAUSE A CLAYMORE
IS A DIRECTIONAL CHARGE,

33:27.939 --> 33:30.676
MOST OF THE BLAST
IS PROPELLED FORWARD,

33:30.709 --> 33:33.579
WHICH MEANS IF DISARMING IT
ISN'T AN OPTION,

33:33.612 --> 33:36.315
BEING BEHIND IT WHEN IT GOES OFF
IS THE NEXT BEST THING

33:36.348 --> 33:39.318
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE
ADEQUATE COVER.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.519
- OKAY.

33:40.552 --> 33:42.254
WE CAN'T RISK TIPPING IT OVER.

33:42.288 --> 33:43.655
THAT'S AS FAR
AS IT'S GONNA GO.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.491
- IS THAT ENOUGH?
- IT SHOULD BE.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.159
- SHOULD BE?

33:47.193 --> 33:49.328
IT SHOULD BE OR IT IS?

33:49.361 --> 33:51.663
"SHOULD BE" IS HOW BOMB TECHS
LOSE BODY PARTS.

33:51.697 --> 33:52.664
- OKAY, THEN IT IS.

33:52.698 --> 33:53.699
- ARE YOU LYING TO ME?

33:53.732 --> 33:55.367
- MAYBE.
I DON'T KNOW.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.002
JUST JUMP THAT WAY, OKAY?

33:57.035 --> 33:58.704
JUMP FAR.
- OKAY, READY?

33:58.737 --> 33:59.938
- NO, I'M NOT READY.

33:59.971 --> 34:03.041
HOLD ON.

34:03.075 --> 34:04.343
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

34:04.376 --> 34:06.412
- HEY, SOMEBODY'S GOTTA
TAKE YOU TO THE HOSPITAL

34:06.445 --> 34:09.781
IF THIS THING GOES WRONG,
RIGHT?

34:09.815 --> 34:11.783
HOLD ON.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.220
OKAY.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.033
WHOO-HOO-HOO!

34:28.066 --> 34:29.301
THAT WASN'T TOO BAD, HUH?

34:29.335 --> 34:31.103
- [groans]

34:31.137 --> 34:32.938
- YOU OKAY?

34:32.971 --> 34:34.206
- YEAH.

34:34.240 --> 34:36.208
NEXT TIME,
YOU'RE ON LOCK DUTY.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.609
- NEXT TIME.
YEAH.

34:37.643 --> 34:40.746
- LET'S SEE WHAT THIS GUY
WAS SO ANXIOUS TO PROTECT.

34:44.650 --> 34:48.454
- WELL, IT'S A HELL OF A WAY
TO REDECORATE.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.556
- NOTHING OUT THIS WAY.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.058
YOU SEE ANYTHING?

34:53.091 --> 34:56.128
- YEAH, CHECK THIS OUT.

34:56.162 --> 34:57.429
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
TURNED HIS KITCHEN

34:57.463 --> 34:58.897
INTO A FAKE I.D. FACTORY.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.832
- GUY MUST HAVE BEEN
A BOY SCOUT.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.501
LOOKS LIKE HE PREPPED
EVERY KIND OF COVER I.D.

35:02.534 --> 35:03.635
HE COULD POSSIBLY NEED.

35:03.669 --> 35:08.407
- AIRPORT SECURITY,
BUILDING INSPECTOR.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.409
- HERE WE GO.
HE'S EVEN WORKING ON--

35:10.442 --> 35:11.843
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

35:11.877 --> 35:15.947
- AW, JESUS.

35:15.981 --> 35:19.151
- OH, MY GOD.

35:19.185 --> 35:20.519
[phone beeps]

35:20.552 --> 35:23.489
[phone rings]

35:23.522 --> 35:24.956
- SAM, YOU FIND ANYTHING?

35:24.990 --> 35:26.458
- FI, WHERE ARE YOU?

35:26.492 --> 35:27.759
- WELL, I'M WAITING
FOR MADELINE

35:27.793 --> 35:29.161
TO FINISH HER CUSTODY MEETING.
WHAT'S WRONG?

35:29.195 --> 35:31.797
- WE JUST FOUND A DEPARTMENT
OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES I.D.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.699
AT THE MYSTERY MAN'S HOUSE.
- WHAT?

35:33.732 --> 35:35.100
- HE'S IN THERE, FI!

35:35.133 --> 35:36.835
HE'S IN THE SAME ROOM
WITH MADDY RIGHT NOW!

35:36.868 --> 35:38.270
GET OVER THERE!

35:38.304 --> 35:40.339
- WHERE IS THE MADELINE WESTEN
CUSTODY MEETING?

35:40.372 --> 35:42.174
- THE EVALUATION IS--
- WHERE IS SHE?

35:42.208 --> 35:44.343
- IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM
AT THE END OF THE HALL.

35:53.752 --> 35:54.986
- MADELINE.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.455
- FIONA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
BACK HERE?

35:56.488 --> 35:58.457
- WHERE IS THE MAN
YOU WERE TALKING WITH?

35:58.490 --> 36:00.125
- MR. EMORY?

36:00.158 --> 36:02.294
HE LEFT FOR TALLAHASSEE.
BUT IT'S GOOD NEWS.

36:02.328 --> 36:04.129
HE'S GONNA RECOMMEND
THAT I GET CUSTODY OF--

36:04.162 --> 36:08.900
- DID HE ASK YOU ANYTHING
ABOUT MICHAEL?

36:08.934 --> 36:10.636
WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU TELL HIM?

36:10.669 --> 36:14.005
- OH, MY GOD.
NO.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.654
- YOU COULDN'T STEAL A CAR
THAT HAD AIR CONDITIONING?

36:28.687 --> 36:30.489
- I CHOSE ONE
THAT WOULDN'T STAND OUT.

36:30.522 --> 36:31.823
YOU WANT COMFORT

36:31.857 --> 36:33.759
OR YOU WANNA GET THROUGH
THIS POLICE CHECKPOINT?

36:33.792 --> 36:36.194
AND COVER YOUR LEG.

36:36.228 --> 36:37.829
A NEW CAR WON'T DO US
MUCH GOOD

36:37.863 --> 36:39.665
IF THE COPS SEE FRESH BLOOD
FROM A BULLET WOUND.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.900
- HEY, YOU JUST WORRY
ABOUT DRIVING, OKAY?

36:41.933 --> 36:43.068
[phone rings]

36:43.101 --> 36:47.906
BUENO?

36:47.939 --> 36:50.409
YEAH, IT'S GOOD.

36:50.442 --> 36:53.245
- IF YOU WORK IN
COVERT OPERATIONS LONG ENOUGH,

36:53.279 --> 36:55.914
YOU DEVELOP A SIXTH SENSE FOR
WHEN YOUR COVER HAS BEEN BLOWN.

36:55.947 --> 36:59.217
- NO, DON'T WORRY.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.086
OKAY, I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.

37:01.119 --> 37:03.355
- WHO WAS THAT?

37:03.389 --> 37:05.524
- IT'S BURKE...CHECKING IN.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.859
- I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO TALK UNTIL THE RENDEZVOUS.

37:07.893 --> 37:12.531
- YEAH, WELL, I GUESS
HE DECIDED TO CHANGE THE PLAN.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.400
- WHEN YOU THINK YOU MIGHT
HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED,

37:14.433 --> 37:16.535
IT PAYS TO TRUST
YOUR INSTINCTS.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.371
AFTER ALL, THE ONLY WAY
YOU KNOW FOR SURE

37:19.405 --> 37:21.373
YOUR COVER HAS BEEN BLOWN

37:21.407 --> 37:23.609
IS WHEN SOMEONE PUTS A BULLET
IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.043
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
GIVE ME YOUR GUN.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.312
IF THE COPS DON'T BUY
OUR STORY,

37:26.345 --> 37:27.913
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SHOOT OUR WAY
OUT OF THIS.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.247
- YOU HAVE A GUN.

37:29.281 --> 37:32.217
- WHICH I'D LOVE TO USE,
BUT I'M OUT OF AMMO.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.420
REMEMBER?
SAVING YOUR ASS BACK THERE?

37:34.453 --> 37:36.988
- LISTEN, IF WE RUN INTO
TROUBLE, I'LL HANDLE IT, OKAY?

37:37.022 --> 37:39.758
- YOU'RE INJURED.
LOOK, THIS IS CRAZY.

37:39.791 --> 37:44.062
- NO, WHAT'S CRAZY IS ME
GIVING MY GUN TO A TRAITOR.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.732
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I KNOW THE TRUTH.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.067
THAT CALL?

37:49.100 --> 37:51.903
THAT WAS FROM A FRIEND
OF MINE IN MIAMI.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.806
HE JUST FOUND OUT
YOU STILL WORK FOR THE CIA.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.409
HANDS ON THE WHEEL, MICHAEL.
- UM...

37:57.443 --> 38:00.512
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOUR FRIEND IS,
BUT THEY'VE GOT BAD INFORMATION.

38:00.546 --> 38:05.451
- FROM YOUR OWN MOTHER, PENDEJO?

38:05.484 --> 38:08.186
YOU TRY ANYTHING, YOU DIE.

38:12.858 --> 38:15.427
- [speaking Spanish]

38:15.461 --> 38:17.763
- UH, TURISTAS.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.298
GOING TO BAHI BAY--BAYAHIBE.

38:20.332 --> 38:22.768
IT'S FISHING.
PESCADOS.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.537
FISH, FISH.

38:25.571 --> 38:28.374
- NAMES AND HOTEL
WHERE YOU STAY.

38:32.511 --> 38:35.514
[yelling in Spanish]

38:37.248 --> 38:39.485
[gunfire]

38:42.754 --> 38:44.756
- [grunts]

38:55.601 --> 38:58.003
- [yells in Spanish]

39:16.221 --> 39:18.490
- HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

39:18.524 --> 39:19.858
- STOPPED AT A CHECKPOINT.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.527
COP STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS.

39:21.560 --> 39:25.363
PABLO, HE--HE PANICKED.

39:25.397 --> 39:27.332
PULLED A GUN.

39:27.365 --> 39:31.437
I TIRED TO GET US
OUT OF THERE, BUT...

39:31.470 --> 39:35.173
- DID HE SUFFER?

39:35.206 --> 39:36.708
TELL ME THE TRUTH, MICHAEL.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.744
- COPS FIRED AT THE CAR.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.980
HEADSHOT.
HE DIED INSTANTLY.

39:44.916 --> 39:49.020
- YOU NEED TO KNOW
WE LOST A HERO TODAY.

39:49.054 --> 39:54.526
AND THIS MISSION CONTINUES
ONLY BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.761
YOU UNDERSTAND?

39:55.794 --> 39:59.431
- I JUST WISH
I COULD HAVE SAVED HIM.

39:59.465 --> 40:03.401
- I'M SURE YOU DID
ALL YOU COULD, MICHAEL.

40:03.435 --> 40:05.070
I'M GONNA GO AWAY
FOR A FEW DAYS.

40:05.103 --> 40:07.739
I'LL BE IN TOUCH, BUT I WANT YOU
TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE

40:07.773 --> 40:10.375
UNTIL I GET BACK.

40:10.408 --> 40:14.813
YOU STAY STRONG, MICHAEL.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.849
AND BE READY.

40:24.590 --> 40:27.559
[exotic music]

40:27.593 --> 40:35.601
*

40:38.804 --> 40:41.673
- [speaking Spanish]

40:44.175 --> 40:45.977
- SO YOU'VE BEEN A BUSY BOY.

40:46.011 --> 40:48.814
APPARENTLY YOU BLEW UP
ABOUT $20 MILLION

40:48.847 --> 40:51.249
OF SATELLITE DECRYPTION
EQUIPMENT YESTERDAY.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.618
ANY IDEA WHY?

40:52.651 --> 40:54.185
- NO, BUT IT'S PART OF SOMETHING
BIGGER, A LOT BIGGER.

40:54.219 --> 40:55.587
BURKE WAS CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

40:55.621 --> 40:56.955
WHAT ABOUT MY COVER?

40:56.988 --> 40:59.991
- WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.497
SOMEONE'S BEEN ASKING
AROUND MIAMI ABOUT YOU.

41:05.531 --> 41:06.798
YOU THINK BURKE KNOWS?

41:06.832 --> 41:09.668
- NO, OR I'D BE DEAD.

41:09.701 --> 41:13.138
PABLO SAID THE MIAMI CONTACT
WAS HIS, NOT BURKE'S.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.974
BUT WHOEVER HE IS, HE WON'T
KEEP HIS SECRET FOREVER.

41:16.007 --> 41:19.778
- WHICH IS WHY I'M HEADED
STATESIDE TO CLEAN THIS UP.

41:19.811 --> 41:22.380
WHEN'S BURKE SUPPOSED
TO MAKE CONTACT AGAIN?

41:22.413 --> 41:24.349
- NOT FOR AT LEAST
ANOTHER 48 HOURS.

41:24.382 --> 41:27.853
- THAT'S CUTTING IT CLOSE,
BUT WE DON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.888
I NEED SOMEONE IN MIAMI
WHO CAN HIT THE GROUND RUNNING,

41:29.921 --> 41:31.623
SO YOU'RE COMING WITH.

41:31.657 --> 41:33.458
- I'LL NEED TO CONTACT
SAM AND JESSE.

41:33.491 --> 41:34.660
- DON'T CONTACT ANYBODY.

41:34.693 --> 41:35.861
THIS ISN'T A CLASS REUNION.

41:35.894 --> 41:38.129
YOU GET SEEN IN MIAMI,
OUR WHOLE OP IS OVER.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.065
WE GO IN,
WE STAY IN THE SHADOWS.

41:40.098 --> 41:41.066
NO ONE KNOWS WE'RE THERE.

41:41.099 --> 41:42.167
WE FIND THIS SON OF A BITCH

41:42.200 --> 41:44.202
AND WE PUT HIM IN THE GROUND.

41:44.235 --> 41:47.873
YOU UNDERSTAND
THE STAKES, RIGHT?

41:47.906 --> 41:50.576
- I UNDERSTAND IT'S HIM OR ME.
