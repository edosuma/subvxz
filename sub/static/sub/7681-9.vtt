01:23.166 --> 01:25.703
Our subject is David Crane.

01:25.709 --> 01:27.700
Is everything on schedule?

01:27.709 --> 01:28.698
Yeah. He will arrive

01:28.709 --> 01:30.700
at Charles DeGaulle
in 20 minutes.

01:31.166 --> 01:33.157
He requested to go shopping.

01:33.166 --> 01:35.157
Shopping? For weapons?

01:35.166 --> 01:36.702
we don't know.

01:36.709 --> 01:39.701
Our men will accompany him
and then bring him here.

01:53.208 --> 01:55.199
David Crane.

01:55.208 --> 01:56.698
A last assessment,
gentlemen.

01:57.208 --> 01:59.199
Is he capable
of meeting our needs?

01:59.208 --> 02:03.201
Yeah. Stealing a Moloch missile
from the U.S. military

02:03.208 --> 02:05.745
without any traceable connection
to our organization

02:05.750 --> 02:07.741
is a major task indeed.

02:07.750 --> 02:11.197
Sometimes I get into some
very bizarre situations,

02:11.208 --> 02:12.744
even for me.

02:12.750 --> 02:16.743
Stuffed dogs, plastic babies
and a mannequin father...

02:17.208 --> 02:20.200
a weird population
for a very typical town.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.745
All of which makes
a perfect target

02:22.750 --> 02:24.741
to test the Moloch missile.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.741
The simulation's good.

02:26.750 --> 02:28.240
The patterns are realistic.

02:28.250 --> 02:29.740
It's a good job, Pete.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.241
Thanks.
How's the clearance?

02:32.250 --> 02:34.241
I'll tell you,
that's not a lot of room for me

02:34.250 --> 02:35.740
to guide a missile through
without hitting anything

02:36.250 --> 02:37.239
but that target.

02:37.750 --> 02:38.739
If you have any doubts...

02:38.750 --> 02:40.240
we developed
this guidance system.

02:40.250 --> 02:41.239
we tested it.

02:41.250 --> 02:44.788
Don't you think it's about time
we trusted it?

02:44.792 --> 02:47.249
It will require a
first-rate operation,

02:47.250 --> 02:49.241
superior skills
both in organization

02:49.250 --> 02:50.786
and execution.

02:51.250 --> 02:53.241
His qualificatio
ns do seem excellent.

02:53.250 --> 02:55.787
They meet virtually
every requirement we have.

02:55.792 --> 02:57.248
I agree,

02:57.250 --> 02:58.786
but I am worried
about his attitude:

02:58.792 --> 03:01.784
too cavalier and strange...
very strange.

03:01.792 --> 03:03.783
we are in a strange business.

03:03.792 --> 03:06.283
The man is
an international thief.

03:06.291 --> 03:08.782
Never caught, convicted
or even suspected.

03:09.291 --> 03:11.282
It is rumored that he is
the moving force

03:11.291 --> 03:14.283
behind that munitions theft
in Cairo last month.

03:16.792 --> 03:19.784
Good. Send him in.

03:20.792 --> 03:23.283
Crane has arrived.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.825
How are you?

03:30.834 --> 03:32.290
Nice of you fellas
to invite me over.

03:32.291 --> 03:34.282
You come well recommended,
Mr. Crane.

03:34.291 --> 03:35.827
Former CIA agent,

03:35.834 --> 03:38.280
trained in all
aspects of espionage.

03:38.291 --> 03:40.828
You also indicate training
with the Panthers.

03:41.291 --> 03:42.827
was that the Black Panther
radicals?

03:42.834 --> 03:44.825
No, the Littleton Panthers.

03:46.333 --> 03:49.325
State champs, '65. 10 and 0.

03:50.834 --> 03:52.825
Football.

03:52.834 --> 03:53.823
I was a quarterback.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.825
I had the best arm
in the league.

03:55.834 --> 03:58.325
we had a great backfield.
I've got 'em with me now.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.823
I've got a good game plan
for you.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.823
This is not a game.

04:01.834 --> 04:04.325
The Moloch missile
le is top secret.

04:04.333 --> 04:06.324
Only when it's all together.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.324
Its parts are scattered
in various points

04:08.333 --> 04:09.322
all over the country,

04:09.875 --> 04:11.866
and in pieces,
they think it's harmless.

04:11.875 --> 04:15.868
But your army relies on precise
paperwork and procedures.

04:15.875 --> 04:17.866
Then we'll use the red tape
against them.

04:17.875 --> 04:19.331
Project Earache.

04:19.875 --> 04:20.863
Prepare for vehicle launch.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.369
Guidance system activated.

04:25.875 --> 04:26.864
Attention, all personnel.

04:26.875 --> 04:30.367
Clear the area.
Prepare to launch.

04:30.375 --> 04:32.366
we're going to aim
and control a missile

04:32.375 --> 04:34.866
by translating human speech
into electronic code

04:34.875 --> 04:37.867
so I can talk it through
the center of town here

04:38.375 --> 04:40.366
without busting up anything
or anybody,

04:40.375 --> 04:41.865
if we're lucky.

04:41.875 --> 04:43.365
That man has no sense

04:43.375 --> 04:45.366
of military discipline
whatsoever.

04:45.375 --> 04:46.911
Abel, cool down.

04:46.917 --> 04:50.364
MacGyver, are you aware
that your comments

04:50.917 --> 04:53.909
are being entered into
a permanent project archive?

04:53.917 --> 04:56.909
Ooh! well, then we better
get cracking, eh, General?

04:56.917 --> 04:58.373
Civilian.

04:58.375 --> 05:00.366
Paris is a great city.

05:00.375 --> 05:02.366
You can buy anything here.

05:04.417 --> 05:04.906
I got this transmitter

05:05.417 --> 05:08.909
in a little shop
in the Latin Quarter.

05:08.917 --> 05:12.409
I found this circuit board
in the Champs d'Elysee.

05:12.417 --> 05:15.909
A little shop on the Left Bank
carries these batteries.

05:15.917 --> 05:17.908
All harmless.

05:17.917 --> 05:20.909
would you set a chair up over
there where we can all see it?

05:23.417 --> 05:25.954
Indulge me, gentlemen.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.950
I'm going to give you
a little demonstration.

05:28.417 --> 05:29.953
Unrelated items,

05:29.959 --> 05:31.950
and each one innocuous
in itself.

05:32.417 --> 05:33.953
That's how bureaucrats tend

05:33.959 --> 05:34.948
to view component parts,

05:34.959 --> 05:35.948
even when they are combined

05:36.417 --> 05:38.954
to create something
substantial.

05:39.417 --> 05:40.953
Now, then,

05:40.959 --> 05:43.416
harmless little pieces,

05:43.417 --> 05:45.954
but you put them all together,
and there's a certain

05:45.959 --> 05:47.449
je ne sais quoi.

05:52.458 --> 05:53.447
I also arranged to have

05:53.458 --> 05:54.948
my people stop here earlier.

05:55.458 --> 05:56.948
They fixed the chair...

05:56.959 --> 06:00.451
and you may have noticed
that I didn't touch anything.

06:00.458 --> 06:02.949
we are all impressed,
Mr. Crane,

06:03.458 --> 06:05.449
but how do we know
we can trust you?

06:05.458 --> 06:06.994
The same way that you know

06:07.001 --> 06:09.447
there are no surprises
under your chairs.

06:15.001 --> 06:16.992
That's right.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.457
You don't know.

06:18.458 --> 06:21.450
Let's keep it that way.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.992
There are the coordinates to
a lake in Southern California.

06:30.001 --> 06:32.492
A rendezvous, mes amis.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.992
Get a seaplane. Be on time.
Bring cash.

06:36.001 --> 06:38.993
we will be on time,
and our plane will make one pass

06:39.500 --> 06:40.990
over your rendezvous lake.

06:41.001 --> 06:45.995
If you are not there,
don't make plans to grow older.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.494
Hey... you're in the best hands
of the class of '65.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.492
Relax.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.491
Commence launch.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.990
Commencing countdown.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.991
19, 18, 17...

07:01.500 --> 07:04.992
16, 15, 14...

07:05.000 --> 07:05.989
Telemetry systems on.

07:06.542 --> 07:08.533
12, 11, 10...

07:08.542 --> 07:09.998
Tracking mode.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.991
8, 7...

07:12.000 --> 07:13.536
Guidance system activated.

07:13.542 --> 07:17.535
4, 3, 2, 1.

07:17.542 --> 07:17.997
Fire!

07:20.542 --> 07:22.533
On control mode. To me. To me.

07:25.041 --> 07:27.532
west 16 degrees, 15 meters.

07:30.542 --> 07:32.533
East 10 degrees, 5 meters.

07:33.542 --> 07:34.531
west 2 meters.

07:36.041 --> 07:37.030
Lock on target...

07:38.041 --> 07:38.541
...now!

07:40.041 --> 07:41.030
Come on, baby,
thread that needle.

07:48.041 --> 07:49.030
All right, right on target!

07:52.041 --> 07:54.032
Nice shot, huh?

07:54.041 --> 07:57.033
Congratulations.
That was amazing! Amazing!

07:57.041 --> 07:58.577
well, what's really amazing
is how well

07:58.583 --> 08:01.040
these translation circuits work
for our project.

08:01.041 --> 08:04.078
Okay, the component is in.

08:05.583 --> 08:08.074
what is that?

08:08.083 --> 08:09.573
This, oh, uh...

08:10.083 --> 08:12.574
it-it's a gadget for...

08:12.583 --> 08:16.075
uh...

08:16.583 --> 08:18.073
Uh, Carrie?

08:18.083 --> 08:21.075
Carrie, how do you say
"electronic translation device"?

08:21.083 --> 08:23.074
You know I can't hear you, Mac.

08:23.083 --> 08:24.072
I've got to see your lips

08:24.083 --> 08:25.619
to read them.
Ah, forgot.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.074
Electronic translation device.

08:29.625 --> 08:30.080
wait a minute.

08:30.625 --> 08:32.081
Electronic...

08:33.082 --> 08:34.619
what? what'd I sign?

08:35.082 --> 08:36.619
what's so funny?
Oh, you don't want to know.

08:36.625 --> 08:37.614
It's not that bad, Mac.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.616
The kids just
think you have, um,

08:39.625 --> 08:41.081
a weird accent.

08:41.082 --> 08:42.619
who, me?

08:43.625 --> 08:45.115
Get out of here.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.115
Get out of here...

08:47.125 --> 08:49.616
Get out of the way!

08:55.125 --> 08:57.116
Carrie?

08:57.625 --> 08:58.614
Carrie?

08:58.625 --> 09:00.616
Pete's calling us.

09:00.625 --> 09:01.114
we're ready.

09:12.667 --> 09:14.123
Don't jump around.

09:14.125 --> 09:16.116
Just watch, okay?

09:17.125 --> 09:20.117
Ready, Maria?

09:20.125 --> 09:21.661
Is she a little nervous?

09:22.125 --> 09:23.114
She's terrified.

09:23.125 --> 09:24.661
Tight as a knot.

09:24.667 --> 09:27.659
Maria's completely deaf...
since birth.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.157
She's afraid
of what she's never known.

09:29.667 --> 09:30.156
Yeah, who wouldn't be?

09:31.667 --> 09:33.658
Maria, do you trust me?

09:36.166 --> 09:37.155
I don't blame you.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.157
All right, then,

09:40.166 --> 09:41.155
I won't turn it on.

09:41.667 --> 09:42.156
You will.

09:42.667 --> 09:43.656
we start with the headset.

09:45.166 --> 09:47.157
You can do it or not.

09:47.166 --> 09:48.155
It's up to you.

09:58.166 --> 09:59.155
That's terrific.

10:01.166 --> 10:05.205
This is just
another way of hearing.

10:05.208 --> 10:07.699
It converts sound
into electronic pulses

10:07.709 --> 10:10.200
so it's the right kind
of sound for you.

10:10.208 --> 10:12.199
This is the sound

10:12.208 --> 10:17.202
of a spring rain in a forest
and birds singing.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.199
So, whenever you're ready,

10:19.208 --> 10:20.698
push this button.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.206
I can't imagine
what it would be like,

10:27.208 --> 10:29.199
hearing for the first time.

10:29.208 --> 10:31.745
Yeah.

10:55.750 --> 10:58.241
"I feel it!

10:58.750 --> 10:59.739
It tickles."

13:24.417 --> 13:25.406
what's the problem?

13:25.417 --> 13:26.907
we have a report

13:26.917 --> 13:28.407
of a missing military vehicle.

13:28.417 --> 13:29.907
Can I see your license
and registration?

13:30.417 --> 13:31.907
And I'd like to see
your travel orders, soldier.

13:32.417 --> 13:33.907
Make sure all
the paperwork checks out.

13:33.917 --> 13:36.408
we'll also take a look
at your vehicle number

13:36.417 --> 13:38.408
see if it matches up
to our report.

13:38.917 --> 13:39.406
You want to call this in?

13:39.917 --> 13:40.406
This isn't stolen.

13:40.917 --> 13:41.906
I'm on assignment.

13:41.917 --> 13:42.906
well, then your papers

13:42.917 --> 13:44.407
will prove that out,
won't they, soldier?

13:44.417 --> 13:47.409
Just give us some cooperation
and we'll be on our way.

13:51.959 --> 13:53.950
Yeah, it looks okay.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.951
welcome to South Carolina.

13:56.959 --> 13:58.415
Drive carefully now.

13:58.959 --> 14:00.950
Have a nice day.

14:08.458 --> 14:09.948
Piece of cake.

14:09.959 --> 14:11.950
well, it's only
the first slice.

14:11.959 --> 14:14.450
And nobody's going
to even know it's gone.

14:14.458 --> 14:16.449
Yeah, well, just
keep those ideas coming, buddy,

14:16.458 --> 14:17.948
and we'll follow you
all the way to the bank.

14:17.959 --> 14:19.449
well, we're not rich yet.

14:19.458 --> 14:23.451
we've still got 4,000 miles
to go in the next two days.

14:44.001 --> 14:45.992
Drink that.

14:46.001 --> 14:47.992
Mac...
Ah.

14:48.001 --> 14:49.992
whatever is bothering
you can wait two seconds.

14:50.500 --> 14:51.990
Take a sip.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.489
Better?

14:57.001 --> 14:57.990
Better.
Okay.

14:58.001 --> 14:58.990
So what's bothering you?

14:59.500 --> 15:01.491
I had a dream about you.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.990
Oh, yeah?

15:03.001 --> 15:04.491
Not like that.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.492
You were killed,
and I was watching.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.992
I mean, I've had nightmares,
but this was real.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.490
Carrie.
I know how crazy it sounds.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.991
But I had to tell you.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.990
I learned something
a long time ago...

15:18.500 --> 15:20.991
never laugh
at what you don't know.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.990
It was so weird.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.536
So tell me about the dream.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.538
You were almost hit
by a lightning bolt.

15:29.542 --> 15:31.999
And then you and I
were being chased

15:32.000 --> 15:33.991
by this Moorish warrior...

15:36.542 --> 15:38.533
...past a steel skeleton.

15:40.542 --> 15:43.534
And then you were hit
by this old car

15:43.542 --> 15:45.533
that came at us
right out of the lake,

15:45.542 --> 15:48.033
and you were killed.

15:48.041 --> 15:51.033
And what does this
all sound like but crazy?

15:51.041 --> 15:52.030
No, no, not crazy.

15:52.542 --> 15:54.533
Dreams come from what we've seen
or what we've done.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.532
They're a way we have
of piecing things together.

15:57.542 --> 15:59.533
I've had this same dream
three times.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.032
I can't get rid of it.

16:01.041 --> 16:03.032
well, I've kind of
been pestering you

16:03.041 --> 16:04.577
to test that hearing device.

16:04.583 --> 16:06.039
Maybe that's tied into it.

16:06.041 --> 16:08.032
Maybe I'm just wasting
your time.

16:08.041 --> 16:10.578
Lightning in the middle
of a sunny day?

16:10.583 --> 16:12.574
Let's just forget it.

16:12.583 --> 16:14.574
Ah. Carrie...

16:14.583 --> 16:17.040
This is "talk."

16:17.041 --> 16:18.030
So is this.

16:18.583 --> 16:21.040
Dreams are just
another way of talking.

16:21.041 --> 16:23.032
I know, but it scared me.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.574
That's because
we don't understand it yet.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.573
The Foundation's doi
ng some sleep research.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.574
I have some experts
I'd like you to talk to.

16:30.083 --> 16:31.072
No, that's okay.

16:31.083 --> 16:33.574
I think I just needed a friend
to talk to.

16:34.083 --> 16:35.072
Thanks.

16:35.583 --> 16:38.074
You gentlemen
can tell your constituents

16:38.083 --> 16:40.074
that this exhibit was set up

16:40.083 --> 16:42.574
with their hard-earned
tax dollars.

16:42.583 --> 16:46.622
we're presenting the missile
shown here in its actual size.

16:46.625 --> 16:48.616
This display contains a replica

16:49.083 --> 16:51.074
designed
by the Phoenix Foundation.

16:51.083 --> 16:54.075
we call it the Moloch missile.

16:54.083 --> 16:56.074
Now naturally,
this model lacks a warhead

16:56.625 --> 16:58.616
and an arming system,

16:58.625 --> 17:01.082
but the propulsion package
is absolutely authentic

17:01.083 --> 17:02.619
and in all other aspects,
gentlemen,

17:02.625 --> 17:05.617
you are looking at a genuine
state-of-the-art weapon.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.116
The design has been modified.

17:08.125 --> 17:10.116
what is going on here?

17:10.125 --> 17:11.615
Slipped off the dolly.

17:11.625 --> 17:15.117
That was one of the exhibits.

17:15.125 --> 17:16.615
Oh, man,
I'm real sorry. Really.

17:18.625 --> 17:20.115
The thing's a mess now.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.115
Let me see if I can find
something to clean it up.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.615
I'll be right back.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.116
You do that.

17:26.125 --> 17:28.116
Fortunately, nothing
important was damaged.

17:28.125 --> 17:29.661
we'll have this square
d away immediately.

17:35.125 --> 17:36.114
Come on, hurry it up.

17:36.125 --> 17:37.661
And be careful.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.658
Yeah, it's a big piece

17:39.667 --> 17:41.123
of $10 million.

17:43.667 --> 17:44.656
what's next?

17:44.667 --> 17:46.157
On to California and
the guidance system.

17:46.166 --> 17:49.158
It's in a think tank calle
d the Phoenix Foundation.

17:49.166 --> 17:50.656
I was there a month ago.

17:50.667 --> 17:51.656
Nice people.

17:58.667 --> 17:59.656
what about security?

17:59.667 --> 18:01.658
Soft. But that's okay.

18:02.166 --> 18:04.157
'Cause tomorrow's our last day.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.158
Six months of planning,
three slices cut,

18:07.166 --> 18:11.159
and we are 25 hours
and eight minutes from gold.

18:11.166 --> 18:12.702
Ooh.

18:13.166 --> 18:15.157
So how do you li
ke Indian food, Pete?

18:15.166 --> 18:18.158
Oh, I'll tell you the truth,
MacGyver, I don't know.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.703
My taste buds burned out
after the second bite.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.157
Ooh.

18:27.709 --> 18:29.199
Pete?

18:29.208 --> 18:30.698
Look, MacGyver,
I can't spend

18:30.709 --> 18:33.200
the Foundation's money
on a series of tests

18:33.208 --> 18:35.199
just because Carrie
had a nightmare.

18:35.208 --> 18:37.199
Besides, I've never been
a big believer

18:37.208 --> 18:39.199
in the dream
research project anyway.

18:39.208 --> 18:41.199
Pete, you got no curiosity.

18:42.709 --> 18:44.199
Carrie's dream
was really intense.

18:44.208 --> 18:46.199
And I just know
those researchers

18:46.208 --> 18:47.744
would love to
have another subject.

18:47.750 --> 18:50.207
And they might be able
to help her out

18:50.208 --> 18:52.199
with some pretty heavy anxiety.

18:52.750 --> 18:53.739
All right, maybe. Okay?

18:53.750 --> 18:55.206
I'll talk to the
project people,

18:55.208 --> 18:57.199
and see what they say.

18:58.750 --> 18:59.739
I'm not saying that...
Pete!

19:02.750 --> 19:04.741
Hey, are you guys all right?

19:04.750 --> 19:06.240
Yeah, we're okay.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.240
I'm really sorry.

19:09.250 --> 19:10.740
Pete...

19:11.250 --> 19:12.239
lightning bolt?

19:12.250 --> 19:13.740
First part of Carrie's dreams.

19:13.750 --> 19:14.739
Now that is a coincidence.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.239
That's a coincidence.

19:16.250 --> 19:17.740
Maybe!

19:17.750 --> 19:19.240
But doesn't it make you
the least bit curious?

19:19.750 --> 19:20.239
Just a little bit?

19:20.750 --> 19:22.741
All right, we'll run the tests.

19:22.750 --> 19:25.241
I mean, the dream did start
with a lightning bolt.

19:25.250 --> 19:28.242
And, uh, it ended up
with you dead.

19:30.792 --> 19:32.783
Yeah.

19:36.250 --> 19:38.241
This must seem kind of strange
to you, huh?

19:38.792 --> 19:40.248
Don't worry, MacGyver.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.241
There's absolutely no
medical risk to Carrie.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.787
This will just take a moment.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.783
Carrie, we want to thank you

19:46.792 --> 19:49.283
for showing up
on such short notice.

19:49.291 --> 19:51.782
After you almost got hit
by a lightning bolt?

19:52.291 --> 19:53.280
well, it was on a truck.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.783
I mean, there could
be other explanations.

19:56.291 --> 19:57.781
I hope this is the way
to find out.

19:57.792 --> 20:00.283
The sedative will begin
having an effect very quickly.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.782
You'll go into a relaxed,
drowsy state.

20:03.291 --> 20:05.282
So you just tell us the dream,
actually visualize it,

20:05.291 --> 20:08.283
and we'll compare your brain
waves with a normal pattern.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.282
what will that prove?
Perhaps nothing.

20:10.291 --> 20:12.828
But there has been considerable
research in this area.

20:12.834 --> 20:14.290
Patterns have been identified.

20:14.291 --> 20:15.827
You're making this sound
so real.

20:15.834 --> 20:17.290
well, it is actually.

20:17.291 --> 20:19.282
See, your brain
is a kind of computer.

20:19.291 --> 20:21.282
Everything you've ever seen
or read or felt

20:21.291 --> 20:22.827
is all locked up there
somewhere.

20:23.291 --> 20:25.327
The problem is retrieval...

20:25.333 --> 20:26.823
your memory.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.825
You think
I'm remembering something?

20:28.834 --> 20:30.324
Or a few somethings.

20:30.333 --> 20:31.322
The experts tell us

20:31.333 --> 20:33.324
that we put these things
into patterns, Carrie,

20:33.333 --> 20:34.823
sometimes a dream pattern.

20:34.834 --> 20:35.823
Like a map
showing us the way

20:35.834 --> 20:37.825
to something real.

20:37.834 --> 20:38.823
You ready to show us the way?

20:42.834 --> 20:45.871
Just try to remember
how the dream began.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.331
Your first image.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.870
we're already getting
a base pattern.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.325
She's entering a highly
receptive state.

20:54.333 --> 20:55.869
Carrie?

20:57.875 --> 20:58.864
Think back.

20:58.875 --> 21:01.332
Tell us what was in your dream.

21:17.875 --> 21:19.365
You and me,

21:19.875 --> 21:21.866
we were running through a forest

21:21.875 --> 21:24.366
and then lightning struck.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.908
It was as if something
was chasing us.

21:27.917 --> 21:29.908
And I then I saw

21:29.917 --> 21:32.374
some kind of a Moorish warrior,

21:32.375 --> 21:32.909
I guess.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.911
No... older.

21:34.917 --> 21:36.908
I mean, from the past.

21:36.917 --> 21:38.373
we jumped into a grave.

21:38.375 --> 21:41.367
There was a steel skeleton
in it.

21:41.375 --> 21:42.911
There was a shot.

21:43.375 --> 21:44.911
Someone was shooting at us.

21:45.417 --> 21:46.907
I don't know why.

21:46.917 --> 21:47.906
Look at the pattern.

21:47.917 --> 21:49.407
Nothing like standard
dream waves.

21:49.417 --> 21:50.907
Much more intense.

21:50.917 --> 21:53.408
The car out of the lake...

21:53.417 --> 21:54.907
I saw the driver.

21:54.917 --> 21:56.407
He was coming after us.

21:59.417 --> 22:00.907
He hit you.

22:04.417 --> 22:05.406
It's all right.

22:05.417 --> 22:06.406
I'm here.

22:08.417 --> 22:11.955
I'm all right. I'm all right.

22:11.959 --> 22:14.951
Carrie, can you tell us
what you just saw?

22:14.959 --> 22:17.416
MacGyver... killed.

22:18.959 --> 22:19.948
Killed.

22:20.417 --> 22:21.406
A... a car hit you.

22:21.959 --> 22:22.948
You had quite
an intense reaction, Carrie,

22:23.417 --> 22:24.406
right off the scale.

22:24.417 --> 22:26.453
It wasn't like any dream
I've ever had.

22:26.458 --> 22:28.449
It was like a memory,

22:28.959 --> 22:32.451
a terribly painful, real memory.

22:32.458 --> 22:34.449
No more tests today.

22:34.458 --> 22:36.449
Sorry, Carrie,
we put you through a ringer.

22:36.959 --> 22:37.448
But I want to know.

22:37.959 --> 22:38.948
what in God's name is happening?

22:39.458 --> 22:40.948
You and MacGyver are very close
in your dream.

22:41.458 --> 22:42.948
when did you first meet?

22:42.959 --> 22:45.996
The first test on the hearing
translation device.

22:46.001 --> 22:47.992
Yeah, at the test site
about a month ago.

22:48.001 --> 22:49.457
Maybe you saw something
out there

22:49.458 --> 22:51.449
that came back up in your dream.

22:51.458 --> 22:52.994
That's all a dream is.

22:53.001 --> 22:54.992
The residue
of the day's events... changed,

22:55.001 --> 22:58.994
rewritten in a different order
sometimes, but there.

22:59.001 --> 23:01.447
we're doing guidance system
tests out there all week.

23:01.458 --> 23:02.994
why doesn't Carrie go back out
and look around?

23:03.458 --> 23:04.994
Maybe something
would jolt her memory.

23:05.001 --> 23:05.990
You're getting curious, Pete.

23:06.500 --> 23:07.990
Yes, I am.

23:08.001 --> 23:09.992
And worried.

23:10.001 --> 23:11.491
Carrie?

23:21.500 --> 23:23.991
All right, check your badges.

23:24.001 --> 23:24.990
They real?

23:25.000 --> 23:26.490
Better believe it.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.991
we're gettin' us a pass to
the last piece of this missile.

23:30.500 --> 23:31.990
Hi. How're you doing?

23:32.500 --> 23:32.989
Pretty good.
How are you?

23:33.000 --> 23:34.490
Identification?

23:34.500 --> 23:34.989
Sure.

23:35.500 --> 23:36.990
Okay, go ahead.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.991
Thank you.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.000
The dream coul
d have been keyed

23:44.000 --> 23:45.536
around a structure
or a person.

23:45.542 --> 23:46.998
Does anything look familiar?

23:47.000 --> 23:48.536
Exactly the same.

23:48.542 --> 23:50.999
But there weren't
so many technicians.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.536
Carrie, the basic setup
is still the same.

23:52.542 --> 23:53.998
Do you want to walk around

23:54.000 --> 23:55.536
and see if anything
jogs your memory?

23:59.542 --> 24:01.999
Ah, Miss Linden,
it's a pleasure.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.991
I understand that, uh,
our system is going

24:04.542 --> 24:06.533
to be a great help
to the deaf community.

24:06.542 --> 24:09.033
Frankly, General, I though
t it was our hearing system

24:09.041 --> 24:10.531
that was going
to help your weapon.

24:13.041 --> 24:14.030
Carrie, would you
like to start?

24:14.041 --> 24:17.033
what do you say
we start at the test site?

24:31.041 --> 24:33.578
Gentlemen, I brought you
a new schematic.

24:36.041 --> 24:38.032
Here, help me here,
would you, a second?

24:38.041 --> 24:39.030
Just pull it out.

24:39.041 --> 24:40.577
Hold that end.

24:40.583 --> 24:42.574
Dr. Blake up at headquarters

24:42.583 --> 24:44.574
wants you to take
a look at it.

24:44.583 --> 24:47.575
Said there might be
some problems with it,

24:47.583 --> 24:49.574
especially in this area here.

24:50.083 --> 24:52.074
See the end
of the link selection?

24:52.083 --> 24:54.574
One here and one right in here.

24:55.083 --> 24:57.074
when you're done with it,
he wants you

24:57.083 --> 24:58.573
to write up an opinion report

24:58.583 --> 25:00.073
on any problems you may see.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.072
I'm sorry, I just don't...

25:03.583 --> 25:04.572
That's him!

25:04.583 --> 25:06.073
From my dream!

25:06.083 --> 25:07.072
That's the man who killed you!

25:10.625 --> 25:12.616
Behind the shed!

25:20.625 --> 25:22.081
Shoot the tires!

25:24.625 --> 25:25.614
Drive!

25:32.125 --> 25:33.114
Mac!

25:39.625 --> 25:40.614
Don't stop. Keep driving!

25:40.625 --> 25:41.614
what about Brown?

25:44.125 --> 25:45.114
He's dead.

25:46.125 --> 25:47.661
Go!

25:58.125 --> 25:59.661
You all right?

25:59.667 --> 26:02.124
Yeah. He's dead.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.114
So's our radio.

26:03.667 --> 26:05.658
And all the vehicles
are out of commission.

26:05.667 --> 26:08.158
You recognized that guy, Carrie.

26:08.166 --> 26:10.657
Yes, but why was he in my dream?

26:19.750 --> 26:20.739
It makes no sense!

26:21.250 --> 26:23.741
why steal just
a guidance system?

26:23.750 --> 26:26.241
It's state-of-the-art.
It's classified.

26:26.250 --> 26:30.243
Damn it, Pete, it is going
to be my career in the shredder.

26:30.750 --> 26:33.742
I have lost a key part
to a top secret missile.

26:33.750 --> 26:36.241
I think you lost
more than just one part.

26:36.250 --> 26:37.740
This is junk.

26:37.750 --> 26:40.787
It's pieced together to look
like one of our devices.

26:40.792 --> 26:42.248
But why do that?

26:42.250 --> 26:43.239
So we wouldn't miss it.

26:43.250 --> 26:45.787
I think they were trying
to make a quiet switch

26:45.792 --> 26:47.248
when Carrie spotted 'em.

26:47.250 --> 26:49.241
But they didn't get
the rest of the missile.

26:49.250 --> 26:50.239
Maybe they already got it.

26:50.792 --> 26:52.248
we're not short any missiles.

26:52.250 --> 26:53.239
No missiles.

26:53.250 --> 26:55.787
what about parts...
like this is a part?

26:56.250 --> 26:58.241
I still don't get it.

26:58.250 --> 27:01.788
I think they're trying to steal
a Moloch missile piece by piece

27:01.792 --> 27:04.283
from different places,
and covering their tracks.

27:04.291 --> 27:06.282
That's impossible.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.282
No, no, it isn't.

27:08.291 --> 27:09.781
In fact, they would've
gotten away with this

27:09.792 --> 27:10.781
without a trace
if Carrie hadn't

27:11.291 --> 27:11.791
blown it for them.

27:12.291 --> 27:13.781
Yeah, it's a great idea.

27:13.792 --> 27:16.784
No fuss, no muss,
no tracks for a long time.

27:16.792 --> 27:19.283
Put all the pieces together,
you got yourself a missile.

27:20.834 --> 27:23.826
I'll start tracing
every warehouse,

27:23.834 --> 27:26.826
supply line and facility
that we've got.

27:32.834 --> 27:36.827
Your dream gave us the
connection... and the man.

27:36.834 --> 27:39.826
Maybe I saw him
out at the test site before.

27:39.834 --> 27:40.823
Yeah, that's possible.

27:41.333 --> 27:43.324
So why don't we keep
workin' on your dream?

27:43.333 --> 27:44.322
See what else
we can dig up, huh?

27:49.333 --> 27:51.824
Now was the lake round?

27:52.333 --> 27:55.325
No, it was more
of an oval shape.

27:55.333 --> 27:57.324
well, why don't I
start drawin' it?

27:57.834 --> 28:00.325
The shoreline of the lake
was more irregular.

28:04.875 --> 28:07.332
There was a little inlet.

28:09.875 --> 28:11.331
with a bite out of one end.

28:14.333 --> 28:16.870
Yeah.

28:16.875 --> 28:19.366
It's kinda weird
lookin' at a dream.

28:19.375 --> 28:20.364
Mm-hmm.

28:20.375 --> 28:23.367
And that's what it looks
like... if it's real.

28:26.375 --> 28:27.865
It's time to find out.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.366
I'm patched into
the Phoenix mainframe,

28:32.375 --> 28:34.866
into a topographical
search program.

28:34.875 --> 28:36.866
It'll match your graphic
of the lake

28:37.375 --> 28:40.367
against about, oh, 20,000
map sections in California.

28:40.375 --> 28:43.913
It's checking for size,
shape, contour...

28:43.917 --> 28:46.374
what if it isn't in California?

28:46.375 --> 28:49.367
Then we got a problem.

29:03.917 --> 29:06.909
My God. It's real.

29:07.417 --> 29:09.908
I really do know this place!

29:09.917 --> 29:13.409
I remember...

29:13.417 --> 29:14.907
Yes, I've been here...
hiking.

29:14.917 --> 29:17.909
And I must have remembered it
and put it in my dream.

29:17.917 --> 29:19.407
Carrie, what about those
guys at the test site?

29:19.959 --> 29:21.415
Do you remember seein'
them out here any time?

29:21.417 --> 29:23.408
You see a lot of people
when you're hiking.

29:23.417 --> 29:25.408
when you can't hear, Mac,
you compensate.

29:25.959 --> 29:26.948
I look at everything.

29:26.959 --> 29:28.415
what about a man on a horse?

29:28.959 --> 29:31.416
Or that, uh, what was
it, the antique car?

29:31.417 --> 29:32.406
I don't think so.

29:32.417 --> 29:34.408
And what about the rest of it?

29:34.417 --> 29:37.955
A steel skeleton,
a car driving on water?

29:37.959 --> 29:39.950
Yeah, well,
it's in dream code, Carrie,

29:39.959 --> 29:41.449
but it's based on reality.

29:41.458 --> 29:43.949
So you wanna show me
where this dream started?

29:43.959 --> 29:46.450
I don't know.

29:47.959 --> 29:50.450
But those trees...

30:02.458 --> 30:04.995
There was a shot, gunfire...

30:05.458 --> 30:07.995
and we were running
in that direction.

30:15.458 --> 30:16.447
what's that?

30:16.458 --> 30:17.994
I don't know. Let's see.

30:24.500 --> 30:25.489
Looks like a mirror.

30:30.001 --> 30:31.491
Off a car.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.991
Or what's left of a car.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.992
Look, the skeleton face!

30:45.000 --> 30:47.491
This must have been what I saw!

30:48.000 --> 30:50.491
A metal skeleton
in sort of a grave.

30:56.500 --> 30:57.990
Hi. Hope I didn't scare ya.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.991
Moorish warrior, right.

31:02.000 --> 31:02.989
Pardon?

31:03.000 --> 31:03.989
Nothin'.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.991
we were just wonderin'
if you might have seen

31:06.000 --> 31:07.536
a big antique car
drivin' around here.

31:07.542 --> 31:09.533
Around here?
There aren't any roads.

31:09.542 --> 31:11.533
I exercise my horses
here every day.

31:11.542 --> 31:12.998
I sure would've noticed.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.536
I must have seen you riding.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.536
Up toward the north shore.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.533
Did you ever see
any cars up there?

31:18.542 --> 31:20.032
No, just some junk machinery.

31:20.041 --> 31:23.533
I saw some men hangin' around up
there, but nobody lives there.

31:28.542 --> 31:30.032
Same damn girl
that was at the test site,

31:30.041 --> 31:31.030
the one who recognized you.

31:31.041 --> 31:32.531
And the guy who jumped Brown.

31:32.542 --> 31:34.533
Run 'em toward the water.

31:34.542 --> 31:35.531
I want that girl!

31:37.041 --> 31:38.531
This can't be happening!

31:38.542 --> 31:40.578
well, it is, and it's no dream.

32:01.583 --> 32:02.072
MacGyver?

32:03.583 --> 32:06.074
MacGyver! MacGyver!

32:40.625 --> 32:42.115
what happened?

32:42.125 --> 32:43.615
After you got hit
with the hovercraft,

32:43.625 --> 32:45.616
they took off across the lake
with your girl.

32:45.625 --> 32:47.115
where's the nearest phone?

32:47.125 --> 32:50.117
In town,
about five or six miles.

32:50.125 --> 32:52.616
Okay, listen, my name's MacGyver
and I need a favor from you.

32:52.625 --> 32:53.614
Go call Pete Thornton

32:54.125 --> 32:55.114
at the Phoenix Foundation.

32:55.125 --> 32:57.116
Tell him what happened here and
that I've gone after the girl.

32:57.125 --> 33:00.117
Pete Thornton!
Phoenix Foundation.

33:00.125 --> 33:01.661
Go, please Gotcha!

33:01.667 --> 33:02.122
Thank you.

33:07.125 --> 33:08.114
Mac was right.

33:08.125 --> 33:09.661
They ran scams
all across the country

33:09.667 --> 33:11.123
picking up parts
in different states.

33:11.125 --> 33:13.662
And we know where they
got the guidance system.

33:13.667 --> 33:15.123
I am going to end up

33:15.125 --> 33:18.663
commanding a penguin watch
in lower Antarctica!

33:19.166 --> 33:23.159
All right, arming, guidance,
propulsion...

33:23.166 --> 33:26.658
but how the hell do you steal
a missile body

33:26.667 --> 33:28.157
without being noticed?

33:28.166 --> 33:30.657
Simple. You don't.
You buy it.

33:30.667 --> 33:34.660
No, no, no, no, even those
casings are highly restricted.

33:34.667 --> 33:36.157
Yes, they are.

33:36.166 --> 33:38.657
So these people used a for
ged purchase authorization

33:38.667 --> 33:42.159
to buy one troop carrier,
two $600 toilet seats,

33:42.166 --> 33:45.704
and one missile body from the
General Armament Corporation.

33:45.709 --> 33:46.698
Then they got the whole package.

33:47.166 --> 33:49.703
Yeah. And apparently
they're Americans, local boys.

33:49.709 --> 33:52.155
In it for the money, they're
gonna want to unload fast.

33:52.166 --> 33:53.702
There's a world full of buyers.

33:53.709 --> 33:55.165
So we don't have much time.

33:59.208 --> 34:01.199
Hurry it up.

34:01.208 --> 34:03.199
we're runnin' late
and the buyer's on his way.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.698
And be careful
with that section.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.700
It's the last part
for the missile.

34:06.709 --> 34:08.699
Did you find anything
in her wallet?

34:08.708 --> 34:11.701
Yeah, her name's Carrie Linden.

34:11.708 --> 34:14.701
She's a teacher for the deaf.

34:16.708 --> 34:19.746
All right, Carrie.

34:19.750 --> 34:22.742
How the hell did you recognize
me at the Phoenix test site

34:22.750 --> 34:24.741
and does anybody else
know about us?

34:25.208 --> 34:28.199
Dave, why don't we just take
the missile and get movin'?

34:28.208 --> 34:30.199
To where?
The buyer's rendezvous?

34:30.208 --> 34:31.744
I want to find out

34:31.750 --> 34:33.741
if they're on to us
before we move anywhere.

34:34.208 --> 34:35.744
She's gonna tell us.

34:35.750 --> 34:41.245
Aren't you... Carrie Linden?

34:44.250 --> 34:44.739
No...

34:45.250 --> 34:45.739
No!

34:46.250 --> 34:47.239
Now look!

34:47.250 --> 34:50.242
Maybe you can't hear,
but you can talk,

34:50.250 --> 34:51.739
and you will.

34:51.750 --> 34:53.239
Believe me, you will.

35:00.792 --> 35:02.783
Crane is CIA?

35:02.792 --> 35:04.248
was... they threw him out.

35:05.792 --> 35:08.249
And the man he killed
out at the site, Peter Brown,

35:08.792 --> 35:11.249
worked for General Armament
as a security guard.

35:13.792 --> 35:15.248
Thornton.

35:15.792 --> 35:16.781
MacGyver?

35:16.792 --> 35:18.783
where is he?

35:18.792 --> 35:20.783
Yeah.

35:20.792 --> 35:22.282
Braden Lake.

35:22.792 --> 35:24.282
30 miles north.

35:24.291 --> 35:25.280
Got it.

35:34.291 --> 35:36.282
The only way I was
gonna find Carrie

35:36.792 --> 35:38.282
was to locate that hovercraft.

35:39.834 --> 35:43.281
It had to have landed
somewhere along this shoreline.

35:43.291 --> 35:46.283
The problem was finding where.

35:47.834 --> 35:50.826
Careful with that.
It's delicate.

35:51.834 --> 35:53.825
Are you sure she was
with the same guy

35:54.291 --> 35:55.280
we saw at the
Phoenix test site?

35:55.834 --> 35:56.289
I'm sure.

35:56.834 --> 35:58.290
He was the one
that tackled Brown.

35:58.291 --> 36:00.828
So, now he shows up here.
That's no coincidence.

36:00.834 --> 36:03.826
Does the man you're with work
for the Phoenix Foundation

36:03.834 --> 36:04.823
or military intelligence?

36:05.333 --> 36:06.322
I told you...

36:06.333 --> 36:09.825
Yes, I know.
He's your friend.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.324
I've heard.

36:11.333 --> 36:14.325
Go get the hovercraft ready.

36:14.333 --> 36:15.823
The buyer'll be here
in a half an hour.

36:17.333 --> 36:19.870
Move it!

36:19.875 --> 36:22.332
Yes, sir, Dave!

36:22.333 --> 36:24.324
Little touchy?

36:24.333 --> 36:28.326
Look, the buyer is gonna
fly over the lake.

36:28.875 --> 36:30.331
One pass, 7:00 sharp.

36:30.875 --> 36:34.322
If we're not there
, he keeps on flying,

36:34.333 --> 36:37.871
and we're out six months
work and $10 million.

37:06.917 --> 37:08.908
Sheriff, MacGyver and the
thieves are at Braden Lake.

37:09.375 --> 37:10.911
It's right in your backyard.

37:11.375 --> 37:12.364
Good. Thank you.

37:12.375 --> 37:14.912
we'll have choppers in the air
right away, full search.

37:14.917 --> 37:15.906
Right.

37:24.417 --> 37:25.406
Throne!

37:27.417 --> 37:29.408
Shh! Be quiet!

37:32.417 --> 37:33.406
Throne!

37:33.917 --> 37:35.407
Sorry about this.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.950
Ow!

37:42.959 --> 37:44.950
why do I do that?

37:51.959 --> 37:53.415
what's he doin' out there?

37:53.417 --> 37:55.408
He's got to be
getting the reserve fuel.

37:56.959 --> 37:58.950
what are you gonna do with her?

37:58.959 --> 38:00.449
Find out if anybody else
is on to us,

38:00.458 --> 38:01.948
if anybody is watching
the pick-up point.

38:01.959 --> 38:03.449
If there's not,
if it's just her,

38:03.458 --> 38:06.450
and there's no problem,
we just kill her.

38:06.458 --> 38:07.447
It's all right.

38:07.959 --> 38:09.449
She's deaf. She can't hear me.

38:09.458 --> 38:10.948
I still don't like it.

38:10.959 --> 38:12.449
well, we got to be practical.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.449
Give me a hand with this.

38:14.458 --> 38:15.447
As soon as we get our money,

38:15.458 --> 38:16.948
I want to be ready to leave.

38:16.959 --> 38:18.449
So where are we gonna
hold the party?

38:18.458 --> 38:19.447
Name it.

38:19.458 --> 38:20.994
Paris, London, wherever.

38:21.001 --> 38:23.447
It's gonna be first class.

38:28.001 --> 38:29.992
Now playtime's over.

38:30.001 --> 38:31.457
All right. I'll tell you.

38:31.458 --> 38:33.449
Smart move.

38:33.458 --> 38:34.994
well?

38:35.001 --> 38:35.990
It's complicated.

38:36.458 --> 38:37.994
I had a dream...

38:43.001 --> 38:44.992
The hovercraft could make
a perfect diversion

38:45.500 --> 38:46.990
if I could start it
from a distance.

38:49.001 --> 38:51.993
All I needed was
a timing device.

38:52.500 --> 38:55.492
what I had was a bunch
of plastic trash bags...

38:58.500 --> 39:01.992
and three different kinds
of fishing line.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.491
Not too promising.

39:06.500 --> 39:08.991
But with a little bit
of imagination...

39:11.500 --> 39:12.990
...anything was possible.

39:16.000 --> 39:16.989
I must have seen you

39:17.500 --> 39:19.536
out at the Phoenix
test site last month.

39:19.542 --> 39:21.533
when you were casin' the place.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.991
There must have been
50 people out there.

39:24.000 --> 39:24.989
How did you remember me?

39:25.542 --> 39:27.533
I think I saw you again here.

39:27.542 --> 39:29.533
Just put the two
memories together

39:29.542 --> 39:31.999
into my dream,

39:32.000 --> 39:34.992
saw you driving that thing,
hitting MacGyver...

39:38.000 --> 39:41.037
The Egyptians invented
the water clock.

39:41.041 --> 39:43.532
It's not a bad idea
if you needed a timer.

39:43.542 --> 39:46.033
And I did.

39:46.041 --> 39:48.532
A couple of good things
about a water clock.

39:49.041 --> 39:53.034
One, a bag of water's
real cheap, and two,

39:53.041 --> 39:55.032
it's easy
to build a balance beam.

40:05.583 --> 40:08.575
The thing
I was balancing was time.

40:08.583 --> 40:11.040
I needed to start the engine
when I was 50 yards away

40:11.583 --> 40:14.040
and five minutes
into the future.

40:14.041 --> 40:17.033
So, by creating an imbalance,
one side

40:17.041 --> 40:19.032
of the beam would lighten up.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.073
And the other side
would pull the starter switch.

40:22.583 --> 40:24.574
I hoped.

40:54.083 --> 40:56.074
And that's
how I recognized you...

40:56.083 --> 40:58.074
from the dream.

40:59.625 --> 41:01.115
well, I'm not a dream.

41:02.625 --> 41:04.115
Now what's this

41:04.125 --> 41:06.116
about the Phoenix Foundation
and the army?

41:06.125 --> 41:08.116
I have a very real missile
of theirs.

41:08.125 --> 41:10.116
what do they know
and what did you tell them?

41:11.625 --> 41:14.116
Let's go over this again,
Carrie.

41:14.125 --> 41:17.617
And remember, this is real.

41:27.667 --> 41:30.124
Crane and company were still
in place.

41:30.667 --> 41:33.659
If my water clock worked,
they'd come out in a hurry,

41:33.667 --> 41:36.124
so I had to figure a way
to handle 'em.

41:36.125 --> 41:39.117
A guy hook and a rope made
for a good beginning.

41:56.166 --> 41:58.157
All they have are pieces
of a dream.

41:58.166 --> 41:59.702
They did some testing.

41:59.709 --> 42:01.700
That's it!

42:01.709 --> 42:03.700
well then, we're about
through with you.

42:04.709 --> 42:06.700
where the hell is Throne?

42:09.709 --> 42:11.700
when I was a kid,

42:11.709 --> 42:13.700
my grandfather taught me
an important thing

42:13.709 --> 42:16.155
about snaring wild game.

42:16.166 --> 42:18.157
They have a great sense
of smell.

42:18.166 --> 42:19.702
They can run fast,

42:19.709 --> 42:21.700
but they usually
don't look down

42:21.709 --> 42:24.701
to see where they're stepping.

42:24.709 --> 42:27.200
I was countin' on these guys
to act the same way

42:27.208 --> 42:29.199
when the water clock
stopped ticking.

42:53.750 --> 42:56.207
Throne just started the engine.

42:56.750 --> 42:58.741
I'll bet you he saw the buyer
comin' in early.

43:02.250 --> 43:03.740
Throne!

43:07.750 --> 43:09.741
Gorman?

43:15.250 --> 43:16.239
Ah!

43:18.750 --> 43:20.240
Ay!

43:29.792 --> 43:30.781
He's okay.

43:31.250 --> 43:32.239
He's just dreamin'.

43:33.792 --> 43:34.247
Just hold it right there!

43:34.792 --> 43:35.247
Don't move!

43:35.792 --> 43:37.783
Shouldn't you take this?

43:37.792 --> 43:38.781
Huh?

43:41.291 --> 43:43.782
Don't drop it.

43:43.792 --> 43:45.282
Okay, I won't.

43:47.291 --> 43:49.282
Now all we have to
do is wait for Pete.

43:53.792 --> 43:55.783
Good timing!

44:44.333 --> 44:45.322
Hello.

44:45.333 --> 44:46.322
You all right?

44:46.875 --> 44:48.331
Mm-hmm, just daydreaming.

44:48.333 --> 44:50.870
Yeah? No lightning bolts
or Moorish warriors?

44:50.875 --> 44:52.331
I'm okay?

44:52.333 --> 44:53.869
Oh, you were fine.

44:54.333 --> 44:55.322
Good.

44:55.333 --> 44:56.869
You know, we may never
figure it out,

44:56.875 --> 44:58.331
but it's a little strange

44:58.333 --> 45:00.369
how all the pieces
of your dream fit together.

45:00.375 --> 45:01.364
Not all.

45:01.375 --> 45:03.366
I was wrong about you dying.

45:03.375 --> 45:04.865
Thank goodness
we all make mistakes.

45:04.875 --> 45:06.365
well, sorry I'm late.

45:06.375 --> 45:08.866
I, uh, think
you'll both be happy to hear

45:08.875 --> 45:10.866
that the missile
has been recovered,

45:10.875 --> 45:13.366
and the three goons that took it
are very busy right now

45:13.375 --> 45:14.865
pointing the finger
at each other.

45:15.375 --> 45:16.865
That's great!
what about the buyer?

45:16.875 --> 45:18.365
well, he was just putting
his plane down on the lake

45:18.375 --> 45:19.364
when the choppers came in,

45:19.375 --> 45:20.364
so they grabbed him
along the way.

45:20.917 --> 45:21.372
Good.

45:21.917 --> 45:22.906
But, best of all,

45:23.375 --> 45:25.912
I got the Foundation
to cough up another $50,000

45:26.375 --> 45:28.366
to continue funding
this project.

45:28.375 --> 45:29.911
That's terrific, Pete!
wonderful!

45:29.917 --> 45:31.908
what?

45:33.375 --> 45:34.364
Huh?

45:38.375 --> 45:39.364
what's goin' on?

45:39.375 --> 45:41.912
I think someone wants
to tell you something.

45:42.417 --> 45:43.907
Go ahead, hon.

45:45.917 --> 45:48.909
Thank you...

45:48.917 --> 45:50.908
MacGyver!

45:57.417 --> 45:59.954
You're welcome.
