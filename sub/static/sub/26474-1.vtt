00:55.889 --> 00:58.638
What a beautiful day,
the perfect day

00:58.640 --> 01:01.141
to meet my best friends,
Sarah and Tammy.

01:01.143 --> 01:03.311
We're heading down to
Bible Town,

01:03.313 --> 01:05.269
the most amazing place on earth

01:05.272 --> 01:08.190
where children can learn beautiful
stories from the Bible.

01:08.192 --> 01:09.442
I just can't wait!

01:09.444 --> 01:12.779
Let's see now, which way is
Sarah's house?

01:12.781 --> 01:14.363
Oh yeah, that way.

01:14.365 --> 01:15.200
Let's go.

01:25.793 --> 01:26.958
Hey Jimmy.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.294
Hey Sarah.

01:28.296 --> 01:30.797
Are you ready for our next
adventure in Bible Town?

01:30.799 --> 01:32.214
I'm super ready.

01:32.216 --> 01:35.217
I'm always ready to go to
Bible Town.

01:35.219 --> 01:36.844
I just can't wait!

01:36.846 --> 01:39.013
Are we picking up Tammy next?

01:39.015 --> 01:41.181
You bet, she's waiting for us.

01:41.183 --> 01:42.102
Let's go.

01:49.191 --> 01:50.942
What a great day, Jimmy,

01:50.944 --> 01:54.237
just a perfect day to visit
Bible Town.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.363
Yeah, I know, right?

02:00.453 --> 02:03.829
I was so excited to
head to Bible Town today,

02:03.831 --> 02:06.332
I couldn't fall asleep
last night.

02:06.334 --> 02:09.126
My mom warmed me up a
glass of milk

02:09.127 --> 02:11.129
and read me a Bible story.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.630
Then I could sleep.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.048
That's cool, Sarah.

02:14.050 --> 02:17.050
My mom reads me stories
from the Bible all the time.

02:17.052 --> 02:19.012
Which story did she read you?

02:19.014 --> 02:20.887
My very favorite one.

02:20.889 --> 02:23.975
It's about the creation
of the world.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.268
Oh, how cool!

02:25.270 --> 02:27.728
That's where God creates
Adam and Eve, isn't it?

02:27.730 --> 02:28.562
Yeah.

02:28.564 --> 02:30.982
It's a super cool story.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.234
It's how God created the world
we live in.

02:34.236 --> 02:37.739
I think everybody should
know it, don't you?

02:37.741 --> 02:38.905
Totally.

02:38.907 --> 02:40.240
Would you like me to
tell it to you

02:40.242 --> 02:42.410
on our way to Tammy's house?

02:42.412 --> 02:44.120
Yeah, I'd love to hear it.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.124
Okay then, here we go.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.250
In the beginning,
God created the heaven

02:50.252 --> 02:54.922
and the earth, and the earth
was without form, and void,

02:54.924 --> 02:58.550
and darkness was upon
the face of the deep.

02:58.552 --> 03:03.138
And the spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters,

03:03.140 --> 03:05.852
and God said,
let there be light,

03:07.312 --> 03:09.436
and there was light.

03:09.438 --> 03:13.441
And God saw the light,
that it was good,

03:13.443 --> 03:16.860
and God divided the
light from the darkness.

03:16.862 --> 03:19.447
And God called the light day

03:19.449 --> 03:22.491
and the darkness he
called night.

03:22.493 --> 03:26.411
And the evening and the
morning were the first day,

03:26.413 --> 03:29.499
and God said,
let there be a firmament

03:29.501 --> 03:31.459
in the midst of the waters,

03:31.461 --> 03:35.129
and let it divide the
waters from the waters,

03:35.131 --> 03:38.924
and God made the firmament
and divided the waters

03:38.926 --> 03:41.511
which were under the firmament

03:41.513 --> 03:44.888
from the waters which
were above the firmament

03:44.890 --> 03:46.100
and it was so.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.230
And God called the
firmament Heaven.

03:51.355 --> 03:56.024
And the evening and the
morning were the second day.

03:56.026 --> 03:59.487
And God said, let the
waters under the heaven

03:59.489 --> 04:02.447
be gathered together
unto one place,

04:02.449 --> 04:05.911
and let the dry land
appear, and it was so.

04:07.038 --> 04:09.871
And God called the
dry land Earth,

04:09.873 --> 04:14.334
and the gathering together
of the waters called he seas,

04:14.336 --> 04:16.588
and God saw that it was good.

04:18.257 --> 04:21.675
And God said, let the
earth bring forth grass,

04:21.677 --> 04:25.053
the herb yielding seed,
and the fruit tree

04:25.055 --> 04:29.517
yielding fruit after his
kind, whose seed is in itself

04:29.519 --> 04:31.896
upon the earth, and it was so.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.731
And the earth brought
forth grass,

04:35.733 --> 04:38.651
and herb yielding seed
after his kind,

04:38.653 --> 04:42.363
and the tree yielding fruit,
whose seed was in itself

04:42.365 --> 04:48.161
after his kind, and God
saw that it was good.

04:48.163 --> 04:53.248
And the evening and the
morning were the third day.

04:53.250 --> 04:57.045
And God said, let there
be lights in the firmament

04:57.047 --> 05:00.505
of the heaven to divide
the day from the night,

05:00.507 --> 05:03.885
and let them be for
signs, and for seasons,

05:03.887 --> 05:05.889
and for days, and years.

05:06.848 --> 05:10.223
And let them be for lights in
the firmament of the heaven

05:10.225 --> 05:14.562
to give light upon the
earth, and it was so.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.356
And God made two great lights,

05:17.358 --> 05:19.901
the greater light to
rule the day

05:19.903 --> 05:22.904
and the lesser light
to rule the night.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.156
He made the stars also.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.075
And God set them in the
firmament of the heaven

05:28.077 --> 05:30.202
to give light upon the earth,

05:30.204 --> 05:33.247
and to rule over the
day and over the night

05:33.249 --> 05:36.584
and to divide the light
from the darkness.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.836
And God saw that it was good.

05:39.838 --> 05:44.052
And the evening and the
morning were the fourth day.

05:45.136 --> 05:49.137
And God said, let the waters
bring forth abundantly

05:49.139 --> 05:51.848
the moving creature
that hath life,

05:51.850 --> 05:54.310
and fowl that may fly
above the earth

05:54.312 --> 05:56.771
in the open firmament of heaven.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.649
And God created great whales

05:59.651 --> 06:02.610
and every living creature
that moveth,

06:02.612 --> 06:05.238
which the waters brought
forth abundantly

06:05.240 --> 06:10.450
after their kind, and every
winged fowl after his kind.

06:10.452 --> 06:12.746
And God saw that it was good.

06:14.081 --> 06:18.500
And God blessed them, saying
be fruitful and multiply,

06:18.502 --> 06:21.586
and fill the waters in the seas,

06:21.588 --> 06:24.507
and let fowl multiply
in the earth.

06:24.509 --> 06:28.722
And the evening and the
morning were the fifth day.

06:30.389 --> 06:33.015
And God said, let the earth
bring forth

06:33.017 --> 06:35.685
the living creatures
after his kind,

06:35.687 --> 06:37.728
cattle, and creeping thing,

06:37.730 --> 06:42.442
and beast of the earth after
his kind, and it was so.

06:42.444 --> 06:45.610
And God made the beast of
the earth after his kind,

06:45.612 --> 06:47.613
and cattle after their kind,

06:47.615 --> 06:52.034
and every thing that creepeth
upon the earth after his kind.

06:52.036 --> 06:55.997
And God saw that it was good.

06:55.999 --> 06:59.959
And God said, let us
make man in our image,

06:59.961 --> 07:03.503
after our likeness, and
let them have dominion

07:03.505 --> 07:07.507
over the fish of the sea,
and over the fowl of the air,

07:07.509 --> 07:11.137
and over the cattle,
and over all the earth,

07:11.139 --> 07:15.558
and over every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.978
So God created man
in his own image,

07:18.980 --> 07:22.690
in the image of God
created he him,

07:22.692 --> 07:25.985
male and female created he them.

07:25.987 --> 07:29.822
And God blessed them,
and God said unto them,

07:29.824 --> 07:34.327
be fruitful, and multiply,
and replenish the earth,

07:34.329 --> 07:38.706
and subdue it, and have dominion
over the fish of the sea,

07:38.708 --> 07:41.084
and over the fowl of the air,

07:41.086 --> 07:45.087
and over every living thing
that moveth upon the earth.

07:45.089 --> 07:48.882
And God said, behold, I
have given you every herb

07:48.884 --> 07:52.844
bearing seed, which is upon
the face of all the earth,

07:52.846 --> 07:55.555
and every tree,
in which is the fruit

07:55.557 --> 07:57.642
of the tree yielding seed.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.726
To you it shall be for meat.

07:59.728 --> 08:02.312
And to every beast of the earth,

08:02.314 --> 08:04.774
and to every fowl of the air,

08:04.776 --> 08:07.651
and to every thing that
creepeth upon the earth,

08:07.653 --> 08:10.195
wherein there is life,
I have given

08:10.197 --> 08:14.617
every green herb for meat,
and it was so.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.786
And God saw every thing that he
had made,

08:17.788 --> 08:20.332
and behold, it was very good.

08:21.291 --> 08:26.170
And the evening and the
morning were the sixth day.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.839
Thus the heavens and
the earth were finished,

08:28.841 --> 08:31.341
and all the host of them.

08:31.343 --> 08:35.761
And on the seventh day God ended
his work which he had made,

08:35.764 --> 08:38.765
and he rested on the seventh day

08:38.768 --> 08:41.727
from all his work which
he had made.

08:41.730 --> 08:45.647
And God blessed the seventh
day, and sanctified it,

08:45.649 --> 08:49.609
because that in it he had
rested from all his work

08:49.611 --> 08:51.695
which God created and made.

08:51.697 --> 08:55.157
The end.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.826
Wow, Sarah, that was so cool!

08:57.828 --> 08:58.953
Thank you, Jimmy.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.829
I know a Bible story too.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.498
Awesome, which one?

09:02.500 --> 09:05.292
It's the story of the
great flood.

09:05.294 --> 09:08.171
I learned it last time
I visited Bible Town.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.881
It's an amazing story, Sarah.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.214
Do you wanna hear it?

09:11.216 --> 09:12.257
Totally!

09:12.259 --> 09:14.844
It goes like this.

09:14.846 --> 09:18.055
And it came to pass when
men began to multiply

09:18.057 --> 09:19.681
on the face of the earth,

09:19.683 --> 09:22.392
that God saw that the
wickedness of man

09:22.394 --> 09:25.772
was great in the earth,
and that every imagination

09:25.774 --> 09:29.858
of the thoughts of his heart
was only evil continually.

09:29.860 --> 09:33.738
And it repented the Lord that
he had made man on the earth,

09:33.740 --> 09:35.864
and it grieved him at his heart.

09:35.866 --> 09:38.325
And the Lord said, I will
destroy man

09:38.327 --> 09:40.744
whom I have created from
the face of the earth,

09:40.746 --> 09:43.790
both man, and beast,
and the creeping thing,

09:43.792 --> 09:45.749
and the fowls of the air,

09:45.751 --> 09:48.920
for it repenteth me that I have
made them.

09:48.922 --> 09:52.507
But Noah found grace in
the eyes of the Lord.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.425
Noah was just man and walked
with God.

09:55.427 --> 09:59.888
And Noah begat three sons,
Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.517
The earth also was corrupt
before God,

10:02.519 --> 10:04.893
and the earth was filled
with violence.

10:04.895 --> 10:08.815
And God looked upon the earth,
and, behold, it was corrupt,

10:08.817 --> 10:12.651
for all flesh had corrupted
his way upon the earth.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.487
And God said unto Noah,

10:14.489 --> 10:17.364
the end of all flesh is come
before me

10:17.366 --> 10:19.992
for the earth is filled
with violence through them,

10:19.994 --> 10:23.746
and, behold, I will destroy
them with the earth.

10:23.748 --> 10:26.290
Make thee an ark of gopher wood,

10:26.292 --> 10:28.709
rooms shalt thou make
in the ark,

10:28.711 --> 10:31.921
and shalt pitch it within
and without with pitch.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.715
And this is the fashion which
thou shalt make it of it.

10:34.717 --> 10:38.344
The length of the ark shall be
300 cubits,

10:38.346 --> 10:40.722
the breadth of it 50 cubits,

10:40.724 --> 10:43.766
and the height of it 30 cubits.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.143
A window shalt thou make
to the ark,

10:46.145 --> 10:49.522
and in a cubit shalt thou finish
it above,

10:49.524 --> 10:53.316
and the door of the ark shalt
thou set in the side thereof,

10:53.318 --> 10:57.738
with lower, second, and third
stories shalt thou make it.

10:57.740 --> 11:01.868
And, behold, I, even I,
do bring a flood of waters

11:01.870 --> 11:04.746
upon the earth,
to destroy all flesh,

11:04.748 --> 11:07.956
wherein is the breath of
life, from under heaven,

11:07.958 --> 11:11.877
and every thing that is
in the earth shall die.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.921
But with thee will I
establish my covenant,

11:14.923 --> 11:18.550
and thou shalt come into
the ark, thou, and thy sons,

11:18.552 --> 11:21.929
and thy wife, and thy
sons' wives with thee.

11:21.931 --> 11:25.098
And of every living thing
of all flesh,

11:25.100 --> 11:28.685
two of every sort shalt
thou bring into the ark,

11:28.687 --> 11:30.938
to keep them alive with thee.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.940
They shall be male and female.

11:33.942 --> 11:37.570
Of fowls after their kind, and
of cattle after their kind,

11:37.572 --> 11:40.864
of every creeping thing of
the earth after his kind,

11:40.866 --> 11:45.744
two of every sort shall come
unto thee, to keep them alive.

11:45.746 --> 11:49.831
And take thou unto thee
of all food that is eaten,

11:49.833 --> 11:51.834
and thou shalt gather it to thee

11:51.836 --> 11:54.837
and it shall be for food
for thee, and for them.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.254
Thus did Noah,

11:56.256 --> 11:59.883
according to all that God
commanded him, so did he.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.636
And the Lord said unto Noah,

12:01.638 --> 12:04.388
come thou and all thy house
into the ark,

12:04.390 --> 12:07.974
for thee have I seen righteous
before me in this generation.

12:07.976 --> 12:11.938
Of every clean beast thou
shalt take to thee by sevens,

12:11.940 --> 12:14.232
the male and his female,
and of beasts

12:14.234 --> 12:17.944
that are not clean by two,
the male and his female.

12:17.946 --> 12:22.156
Of fowls also of the air by
sevens, the male and the female,

12:22.158 --> 12:26.326
to keep the seed alive upon
the face of all the earth.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.912
For yet seven days,
and I will cause it

12:28.914 --> 12:32.791
to rain upon the earth
40 days and 40 nights,

12:32.793 --> 12:36.045
and every living
substance that I have made

12:36.047 --> 12:39.257
will I destroy from off
the face of the earth.

12:39.259 --> 12:43.552
And Noah did according unto all
that the Lord commanded him.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.013
And Noah was 600 years old

12:46.015 --> 12:49.599
when the flood of waters
was upon the earth.

12:49.601 --> 12:53.103
And Noah went in, and
his sons, and his wife,

12:53.105 --> 12:55.982
and his sons' wives
with him, into the ark,

12:55.984 --> 12:58.443
because of the waters
of the flood.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.070
Of clean beasts, and of
beasts that are not clean,

13:01.072 --> 13:02.780
and of fowls, and of every thing

13:02.782 --> 13:04.449
that creepeth upon the earth,

13:04.451 --> 13:08.286
there went in two and two
unto Noah into the ark,

13:08.288 --> 13:12.290
the male and the female,
as God had commanded Noah.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.084
And it came to pass
after seven days

13:15.086 --> 13:18.128
that the waters of the
flood were upon the earth.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.757
In the 600th year of
Noah's life,

13:20.759 --> 13:23.884
in the second month, the
17th day of the month,

13:23.886 --> 13:26.804
the same day were all the
fountains of the great deep

13:26.806 --> 13:29.973
broken up, and the windows
of heaven were opened.

13:29.975 --> 13:34.478
And the rain was upon the
earth 40 days and 40 nights.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.065
In the selfsame day
entered Noah, and Shem,

13:38.067 --> 13:41.109
and Ham, and Japheth,
the sons of Noah,

13:41.111 --> 13:44.613
and Noah's wife and the three
wives of his sons with them

13:44.615 --> 13:46.031
into the ark.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.868
They, and every beast
after his kind,

13:48.870 --> 13:51.536
and all the cattle
after their kind,

13:51.538 --> 13:54.123
and every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth

13:54.125 --> 13:57.794
after his kind, and every
fowl after his kind,

13:57.796 --> 14:00.171
every bird of every sort.

14:00.173 --> 14:03.382
And they went in unto Noah into
the ark,

14:03.384 --> 14:07.554
two and two of all flesh,
wherein is the breath of life.

14:09.057 --> 14:14.017
And they that went in, went in
male and female of all flesh,

14:14.019 --> 14:18.815
as God had commanded him,
and the Lord shut him in.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.983
And the flood was 40 days upon
the earth,

14:21.985 --> 14:25.738
and the waters increased,
and bare up the ark,

14:25.740 --> 14:28.449
and it was lift up
above the earth.

14:28.451 --> 14:29.950
And the waters prevailed,

14:29.952 --> 14:32.161
and were increased
greatly upon the earth,

14:32.163 --> 14:35.039
and the ark went upon
the face of the waters.

14:35.041 --> 14:38.417
And the waters prevailed
exceedingly upon the earth,

14:38.419 --> 14:40.085
and all the high hills

14:40.087 --> 14:43.797
that were under the whole
heaven were covered.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.925
15 cubits upward did
the waters prevail,

14:46.927 --> 14:48.969
and the mountains were covered.

14:48.971 --> 14:52.890
And all flesh died that
moved upon the earth,

14:52.892 --> 14:56.477
both of fowl, and of cattle,
and of beast,

14:56.479 --> 15:00.605
and of every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth,

15:00.607 --> 15:02.525
and every man.

15:02.527 --> 15:06.028
All in whose nostrils
was the breath of life,

15:06.030 --> 15:09.156
of all that was in the dry land,
died.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.743
And every living substance
was destroyed,

15:11.745 --> 15:13.703
which was upon the face
of the ground,

15:13.705 --> 15:16.664
both man, and cattle,
and the creeping things,

15:16.666 --> 15:18.498
and the fowl of the heaven,

15:18.500 --> 15:20.834
and they were destroyed
from the earth,

15:20.836 --> 15:23.212
and Noah only remained alive

15:23.214 --> 15:26.174
and they that were with him in
the ark.

15:26.176 --> 15:30.305
And the waters prevailed
upon the earth 150 days.

15:36.019 --> 15:39.061
Whoa, Jimmy,
that was incredible!

15:39.063 --> 15:41.564
You told the story so well, too.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.107
Thanks, Sarah.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.193
What a supertastic day!

15:45.195 --> 15:47.820
I'm having so much fun.

15:47.822 --> 15:50.823
Oh look, there's Tammy's house.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.742
That's Tammy over there.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.204
Let's go.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.249
Jimmy, Sarah.

16:01.251 --> 16:02.542
Hey Tammy.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.837
You said you had a
surprise for me, guys?

16:04.839 --> 16:07.047
I can't wait to find out
what it is.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.342
Jump on board my very
special hot air balloon,

16:09.344 --> 16:11.259
and we'll tell ya all about it.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.262

16:18.394 --> 16:20.686
Wow guys, this is so cool.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.979
I love the view from here.

16:22.981 --> 16:25.023
Isn't it awesome?

16:25.025 --> 16:26.358
Yeah.

16:26.360 --> 16:29.237
So, are you gonna tell me
what we're up to today?

16:29.239 --> 16:31.238
I can't wait to hear
all about it.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.281
We're going to Bible Town!

16:33.283 --> 16:35.158
Whoa, Bible Town?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.411
What is that?

16:36.413 --> 16:39.579
Bible Town is the
most awesome place on earth.

16:39.581 --> 16:42.583
Everybody in Bible Town
knows all these stories

16:42.585 --> 16:44.127
from the Bible.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.878
And because everybody
there is so super nice,

16:46.880 --> 16:49.549
they will gladly tell you
a story from the Bible.

16:49.551 --> 16:50.382
No way!

16:50.384 --> 16:53.469
Tots, all you have to do
is ask.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.972
Whoa, that's so awesome, guys.

16:55.974 --> 16:59.517
But, do they really know all
the stories from the Bible?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.435
There is a lotta them, you know.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.311
Yeah, they know all of them.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.189
That's why it's so cool.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.482
Even the story about the birth
of Jesus?

17:07.483 --> 17:10.611
Oh yes, everybody just
loves that Bible story.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.488
That's my favorite one too.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.406
I know that story by heart.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.409
My dad always reads it to me.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.201
Can I tell it to you guys?

17:18.203 --> 17:19.411
I'd love to hear it.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.579
What about you, Sarah?

17:20.582 --> 17:21.998
Oh, tots.

17:22.000 --> 17:22.914
Cool.

17:22.915 --> 17:25.000
This is how it goes.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.252
And it came to pass
in those days

17:27.255 --> 17:30.340
that there went out a
decree from Caesar Augustus

17:30.342 --> 17:32.842
that all the world
should be taxed.

17:32.844 --> 17:36.595
And all went to be taxed,
every one into his own city.

17:36.597 --> 17:39.306
And Joseph also went up
from Galilee

17:39.308 --> 17:42.226
out of the city of Nazareth,
into Judaea,

17:42.228 --> 17:45.479
unto the city of David
which is called Bethlehem,

17:45.481 --> 17:48.149
because he was of the
house and lineage of David,

17:48.151 --> 17:51.443
to be taxed with Mary his
espoused wife

17:51.445 --> 17:53.946
who was great with child.

17:53.948 --> 17:56.407
And so it was that while they
were there

17:56.409 --> 17:59.701
the days were accomplished
that she should be delivered.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.287
And she brought forth her
firstborn son

18:02.289 --> 18:04.915
and wrapped him in
swaddling clothes

18:04.917 --> 18:06.750
and laid him in a manger,

18:06.752 --> 18:09.379
because there was no
room for them in the inn.

18:09.381 --> 18:11.296
And there were in the
same country

18:11.298 --> 18:13.173
shepherds abiding in the field,

18:13.175 --> 18:15.677
keeping watch over their flock
by night.

18:15.679 --> 18:19.305
And, lo, the angel of
the Lord came upon them,

18:19.307 --> 18:23.017
and the glory of the Lord
shone round about them,

18:23.019 --> 18:25.186
and they were sore afraid.

18:25.188 --> 18:29.190
And the angel said unto
them, fear not, for behold,

18:29.192 --> 18:31.859
I bring you good tidings of
great joy,

18:31.861 --> 18:34.027
which shall be to all people.

18:34.029 --> 18:36.279
For unto you is born this day

18:36.281 --> 18:40.159
in the city of David a Savior,
which is Christ the Lord.

18:40.161 --> 18:42.870
And this shall be a sign
unto you.

18:42.872 --> 18:46.498
Ye shall find the babe
wrapped in swaddling clothes,

18:46.500 --> 18:48.084
lying in a manger.

18:48.086 --> 18:50.545
And suddenly there was
with the angel

18:50.547 --> 18:54.090
a multitude of the heavenly
host praising God, and saying,

18:54.092 --> 18:56.342
glory to God in the highest,

18:56.344 --> 18:59.594
and on earth peace, good will
toward men.

18:59.596 --> 19:03.306
And it came to pass, as
the angels were gone away

19:03.308 --> 19:06.936
from them into heaven, the
shepherds said one to another,

19:06.938 --> 19:09.771
let us now go even
unto Bethlehem,

19:09.773 --> 19:12.482
and see this thing which is come
to pass

19:12.484 --> 19:15.486
which the Lord hath made known
unto us.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.404
And they came with haste

19:17.406 --> 19:21.284
and found Mary, and Joseph,
and the babe lying in a manger.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.952
And when they had seen
it, they made known abroad

19:23.954 --> 19:27.164
the saying which was told
them concerning this child.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.043
And all they that heard it
wondered at those things

19:30.045 --> 19:32.461
which were told them
by the shepherds.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.921
But Mary kept all these things,

19:34.923 --> 19:37.257
and pondered them in her heart.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.886
And the shepherds returned,
glorifying and praising God

19:40.888 --> 19:43.639
for all the things that
they had heard and seen,

19:43.641 --> 19:45.557
as it was told unto them.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.559
And when eight days
were accomplished

19:47.561 --> 19:49.853
for the circumcising
of the child,

19:49.855 --> 19:52.815
his name was called Jesus.

19:52.817 --> 19:57.194
Wow, Tammy,
that was so beautiful.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.113
- What a great story!
- Thanks, Sarah.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.784
What about the story
about the three wise men

20:02.786 --> 20:06.161
from the East that brought
gifts to baby Jesus?

20:06.163 --> 20:08.122
That's a beautiful story too.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.873
I know that one.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.334
Tell us, Sarah.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.044
It goes like this.

20:13.046 --> 20:16.588
Now when Jesus was born
in Bethlehem of Judaea

20:16.590 --> 20:18.632
in the days of Herod the king,

20:18.634 --> 20:22.804
behold, there came wise men
from the east to Jerusalem,

20:22.806 --> 20:27.016
saying, where is he that
is born King of the Jews?

20:27.018 --> 20:29.768
For we have seen his star
in the east,

20:29.770 --> 20:32.188
and are come to worship him.

20:32.190 --> 20:34.815
When Herod the king
had heard these things,

20:34.817 --> 20:38.486
he was troubled, and
all Jerusalem with him.

20:38.488 --> 20:41.572
And when he had gathered
all the chief priests

20:41.574 --> 20:44.033
and scribes of the
people together,

20:44.035 --> 20:47.370
he demanded of them where
Christ should be born.

20:47.372 --> 20:51.082
And they said unto him,
in Bethlehem of Judaea,

20:51.084 --> 20:54.043
for thus it is written
by the prophet,

20:54.045 --> 20:57.337
and thou Bethlehem, in the land
of Judah,

20:57.339 --> 21:00.632
art not the least among
the princes of Judah,

21:00.634 --> 21:03.553
for out of thee shall
come a Governor

21:03.555 --> 21:07.097
that shall rule my
people Israel.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.642
Then Herod, when he had
privily called the wise men,

21:10.644 --> 21:14.689
inquired of them diligently
what time the star appeared.

21:14.691 --> 21:17.859
And he sent them to Bethlehem
and said,

21:17.861 --> 21:21.362
go and search diligently
for the young child,

21:21.364 --> 21:24.949
and when ye have found
him, bring me word again

21:24.951 --> 21:28.494
that I may come and worship
him also.

21:28.496 --> 21:31.788
When they had heard the
king, they departed.

21:31.790 --> 21:35.250
And, lo, the star which
they saw in the east

21:35.252 --> 21:38.504
went before them, till
it came and stood over

21:38.506 --> 21:40.797
where the young child was.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.633
When they saw the star,
they rejoiced

21:43.635 --> 21:45.721
with exceeding great joy.

21:46.556 --> 21:49.265
And when they were come
into the house,

21:49.267 --> 21:52.559
they saw the young child
with Mary his mother,

21:52.561 --> 21:55.147
and fell down and worshiped him.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.399
And when they had opened
their treasures,

21:58.401 --> 22:00.817
they presented unto him gifts,

22:00.819 --> 22:03.615
gold, and frankincense,
and myrrh.

22:04.699 --> 22:07.074
And being warned of God
in a dream

22:07.076 --> 22:09.576
that they should not return
to Herod,

22:09.578 --> 22:12.997
they departed into their
own country another way.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.123
And when they were departed,

22:15.125 --> 22:18.001
behold, the angel of the
Lord appeareth

22:18.003 --> 22:20.337
to Joseph in a dream, saying,

22:20.339 --> 22:24.257
arise, and take the young
child and his mother

22:24.259 --> 22:27.344
and flee into Egypt,
and be thou there

22:27.346 --> 22:29.263
until I bring thee word,

22:29.265 --> 22:33.183
for Herod will seek the
young child to destroy him.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.144
When he arose,
he took the young child

22:36.146 --> 22:40.065
and his mother by night,
and departed into Egypt.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.693
And was there until the
death of Herod,

22:42.695 --> 22:45.613
that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken of the Lord

22:45.615 --> 22:50.492
by the prophet, saying, out
of Egypt have I called my son.

22:50.494 --> 22:54.663
Then Herod, when he saw that
he was mocked of the wise men,

22:54.665 --> 22:57.542
was exceeding wroth,
and sent forth

22:57.544 --> 23:01.379
and slew all the children
that were in Bethlehem,

23:01.381 --> 23:03.588
and in all the coasts thereof

23:03.590 --> 23:05.924
from two years old and under,

23:05.926 --> 23:08.553
according to the time
which he had diligently

23:08.555 --> 23:11.055
inquired of the wise men.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.682
Then was fulfilled that which
was spoken

23:13.684 --> 23:15.934
by Jeremy the prophet, saying,

23:15.936 --> 23:18.478
in Rama was there a voice heard,

23:18.480 --> 23:22.607
lamentation, and weeping,
and great mourning,

23:22.609 --> 23:25.402
Rachel weeping for her children,

23:25.404 --> 23:30.365
and would not be comforted,
because they are not.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.285
But when Herod was dead,

23:32.287 --> 23:35.162
behold, an angel of the
Lord appeareth

23:35.164 --> 23:38.248
in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
saying,

23:38.250 --> 23:41.710
arise, and take the young
child and his mother,

23:41.712 --> 23:44.296
and go into the land of Israel,

23:44.298 --> 23:48.217
for they are dead which
sought the young child's life.

23:48.219 --> 23:52.220
And he arose and took the
young child and his mother

23:52.222 --> 23:55.099
and came into the
land of Israel.

23:55.101 --> 23:58.769
But when he heard that
Archelaus did reign in Judaea

23:58.771 --> 24:01.146
in the room of his father Herod,

24:01.148 --> 24:04.066
he was afraid to go thither.

24:04.068 --> 24:07.819
Notwithstanding, being
warned of God in a dream,

24:07.821 --> 24:11.282
he turned aside into the parts
of Galilee.

24:11.284 --> 24:14.576
And he came and dwelt in
a city called Nazareth

24:14.578 --> 24:18.623
that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken by the prophets,

24:18.625 --> 24:21.668
he shall be called a Nazarene.

24:21.670 --> 24:24.211
Sarah, that
was such a great story,

24:24.213 --> 24:26.213
and you told it so well.

24:26.215 --> 24:27.757
Thanks, Jimmy.

24:27.759 --> 24:28.924
Me too, me too!

24:28.926 --> 24:31.094
I wanna tell you guys another
Bible story.

24:31.096 --> 24:31.928
Can I?

24:31.930 --> 24:34.096
Yeah, Jimmy,
go for it.

24:34.098 --> 24:35.722
Super cool.

24:35.724 --> 24:39.686
Okay guys, this is the story
of Jesus in the temple.

24:39.688 --> 24:40.728
Love it.

24:40.730 --> 24:42.604
This is how it goes.

24:42.606 --> 24:46.234
And the child grew and
waxed strong in spirit,

24:46.236 --> 24:50.654
filled with wisdom, and the
grace of God was upon him.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.824
Now his parents went
to Jerusalem every year

24:52.826 --> 24:54.784
at the feast of the passover.

24:54.786 --> 24:56.576
And when he was 12 years old

24:56.578 --> 24:59.747
they went up to Jerusalem
after the custom of the feast.

24:59.749 --> 25:01.790
And when they had
fulfilled the days,

25:01.792 --> 25:03.668
as they returned,
the child Jesus

25:03.670 --> 25:05.545
tarried behind in Jerusalem,

25:05.547 --> 25:07.796
and Joseph and his mother knew
not of it.

25:07.798 --> 25:10.341
But they, supposing him to
have been in the company,

25:10.343 --> 25:11.926
went a day's journey,

25:11.928 --> 25:14.554
and they sought him among their
kinsfolk and acquaintance.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.514
And when they found him not,

25:16.516 --> 25:19.517
they turned back again to
Jerusalem, seeking him.

25:19.519 --> 25:22.394
And it came to pass that after
three days

25:22.396 --> 25:24.021
they found him in the temple,

25:24.023 --> 25:25.773
sitting in the midst
of the doctors,

25:25.775 --> 25:28.484
both hearing them and
asking them questions.

25:28.486 --> 25:30.944
And all that heard him
were astonished

25:30.946 --> 25:33.530
at his understanding
and answers.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.199
And when they saw him,
they were amazed,

25:36.201 --> 25:37.910
and his mother said unto him,

25:37.912 --> 25:41.038
son, why hast thou thus dealt
with us?

25:41.040 --> 25:44.624
Behold, thy father and I
have sought thee sorrowing.

25:44.626 --> 25:48.296
And he said unto them, how
is it that ye sought me?

25:48.298 --> 25:51.757
Wist ye not that I must be
about my Father's business?

25:51.759 --> 25:55.803
And they understood not the
saying which he spake unto them.

25:55.805 --> 25:58.555
And he went down with
them and came to Nazareth,

25:58.557 --> 26:00.350
and was subject unto them,

26:00.352 --> 26:03.518
but his mother kept all
these sayings in her heart.

26:03.520 --> 26:06.564
And Jesus increased in wisdom
and stature,

26:06.566 --> 26:09.441
and in favor with God and man.

26:09.443 --> 26:11.193
Wow, amazing!

26:11.195 --> 26:12.778
I love that story.

26:12.780 --> 26:16.449
I wish I had a friend
just like Jesus.

26:16.451 --> 26:17.324
You do!

26:17.326 --> 26:19.869
Yeah, Jesus is with
you already.

26:19.871 --> 26:22.747
All you have to do is love
him with all your heart.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.457
You're right, guys.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.251
I do love him so much.

26:27.461 --> 26:28.585
Me too!

26:28.587 --> 26:29.422
Me too.

26:31.465 --> 26:34.092
Hey guys, check it out,
down there.

26:34.094 --> 26:35.886

26:36.762 --> 26:40.097
- Cool, we're here.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.392
Now we go and hear
some of the most amazing

26:42.394 --> 26:43.976
stories from the Bible.

26:43.978 --> 26:45.644
Let's go see Pam.

26:45.646 --> 26:49.190
She always tells amazing
Bible stories.

26:49.192 --> 26:50.816
She's the best.

26:50.818 --> 26:52.985
All right, let's go
see Pam.

26:52.987 --> 26:55.028
Bible Town, here we come!

26:55.030 --> 26:56.447
Woo hoo!

27:00.953 --> 27:02.120
Hey Pam.

27:02.122 --> 27:05.581
Hey guys, so nice to see you.

27:05.583 --> 27:08.125
Thanks, it's nice to see
you too.

27:08.127 --> 27:11.004
This is Tammy, and she's
visiting for the first time.

27:11.006 --> 27:13.547
Welcome to Bible Town, Tammy.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.842
I hope you have an
awesome visit.

27:15.844 --> 27:17.677
Oh, I'm sure I will.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.469
This place sounds amazing.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.765
You know, I was hoping
you'd come by today.

27:22.767 --> 27:26.768
I've been practicing telling
a really great Bible story.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.979
Ooh, that's cool.

27:28.981 --> 27:32.900
I think you're the best story
teller in all of Bible Town.

27:32.902 --> 27:35.068
I'd love to hear it.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.697
Oh wow, thanks, Sarah.

27:37.699 --> 27:40.199
Which story will you tell us,
Pam?

27:40.201 --> 27:44.413
This is the story of
Jesus being baptized by John.

27:45.248 --> 27:49.584
There was a man sent from
God, whose name was John.

27:49.586 --> 27:53.796
The same came for a witness
to bear witness of the light,

27:53.798 --> 27:56.843
that all men through
him might believe.

27:57.969 --> 27:59.844
He was not that light,

27:59.846 --> 28:03.847
but was sent to bear
witness of that light.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.850
That was the true light,

28:05.852 --> 28:10.563
which lighteth every man
that cometh into the world.

28:10.565 --> 28:14.734
He was in the world and
the world was made by him

28:14.736 --> 28:16.780
and the world knew him not.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.323
But as many as received him,

28:20.325 --> 28:24.951
to them gave he power to
become the sons of God,

28:24.953 --> 28:28.081
even to them that believe
on his name,

28:28.083 --> 28:30.958
which were born, not of blood

28:30.960 --> 28:33.129
nor of the will of the flesh

28:34.088 --> 28:37.008
nor of the will of man,
but of God.

28:39.219 --> 28:43.261
And the word was made
flesh and dwelt among us,

28:43.263 --> 28:45.806
and we beheld his glory,

28:45.808 --> 28:49.727
the glory as the only
begotten of the Father,

28:49.729 --> 28:53.105
full of grace and truth.

28:53.107 --> 28:56.984
In the 15th year of the
reign of Tiberius Caesar,

28:56.986 --> 29:00.238
Pontius Pilate being
governor of Judaea,

29:00.240 --> 29:03.615
and Herod being
tetrarch of Galilee,

29:03.617 --> 29:06.911
Annas and Caiaphas being the
high priests,

29:06.913 --> 29:09.287
the word of God came unto John

29:09.289 --> 29:13.167
the son of Zacharias
in the wilderness.

29:13.169 --> 29:16.962
And he came into all the
country about Jordan,

29:16.964 --> 29:19.841
preaching the baptism
of repentance

29:19.843 --> 29:22.053
for the remission of sins.

29:23.054 --> 29:25.721
As it is written in the book of
the words

29:25.723 --> 29:28.056
of Esaias the prophet, saying,

29:28.058 --> 29:31.602
the voice of one crying
in the wilderness,

29:31.604 --> 29:36.606
prepare ye the way of the
Lord, make his paths straight.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.067
Every valley shall be filled,

29:39.069 --> 29:42.904
and every mountain and
hill shall be brought low,

29:42.906 --> 29:45.615
and the crooked shall be
made straight,

29:45.617 --> 29:48.702
and the rough ways
shall be made smooth.

29:48.704 --> 29:52.914
And all flesh shall see
the salvation of God.

29:52.916 --> 29:57.085
And the same John had his
raiment of camel's hair

29:57.087 --> 30:00.047
and a leathern girdle
about his loins,

30:00.049 --> 30:03.968
and his meat was locusts and
wild honey.

30:03.970 --> 30:08.055
Then went out to him
Jerusalem, and all Judaea

30:08.057 --> 30:11.225
and all the region
round about Jordan,

30:11.227 --> 30:16.104
and were baptized of him in
Jordan, confessing their sins.

30:16.106 --> 30:19.400
Then said he to the
multitude that came forth

30:19.402 --> 30:23.696
to be baptized of him,
oh generations of vipers,

30:23.698 --> 30:27.866
who hath warned you to flee
from the wrath to come?

30:27.868 --> 30:31.828
Bring forth therefore
fruits worthy of repentance,

30:31.830 --> 30:34.957
and begin not to say
within yourselves,

30:34.959 --> 30:37.336
we have Abraham to our father.

30:38.672 --> 30:42.840
For I say unto you, that
God is able of these stones

30:42.842 --> 30:45.637
to raise up children
unto Abraham.

30:46.471 --> 30:51.140
And now also the axe is laid
unto the root of the trees.

30:51.142 --> 30:55.268
Every tree therefore which
bringeth not forth good fruit

30:55.270 --> 30:58.980
is hewn down,
and cast into the fire.

30:58.982 --> 31:02.985
And the people asked him,
saying, what shall we do then?

31:02.987 --> 31:05.904
He answereth and saith
unto them,

31:05.906 --> 31:07.907
we that hath two coats,

31:07.909 --> 31:11.076
let him impart to him
that hath none,

31:11.078 --> 31:15.123
and he that hath meat,
let him do likewise.

31:15.125 --> 31:18.625
Then came also publicans
to be baptized,

31:18.627 --> 31:22.713
and said unto him,
master, what shall we do?

31:22.715 --> 31:25.632
And he said unto them,
exact no more

31:25.634 --> 31:27.969
than that which is
appointed you.

31:27.971 --> 31:31.180
And the soldiers likewise
demanded of him, saying,

31:31.182 --> 31:33.056
and what shall we do?

31:33.058 --> 31:37.061
And he said unto them,
do violence to no man,

31:37.063 --> 31:41.276
neither accuse any falsely,
and be content with your wages.

31:42.277 --> 31:45.402
And as the people
were in expectation,

31:45.404 --> 31:48.405
and all men mused in their
hearts of John

31:48.407 --> 31:50.824
whether he were the
Christ or not,

31:50.826 --> 31:53.577
John answered,
saying unto them all,

31:53.579 --> 31:56.663
I indeed baptize you
with water but one

31:56.665 --> 32:00.709
mightier than I cometh,
the latchet of whose shoes

32:00.711 --> 32:03.254
I am not worthy to unloose.

32:03.256 --> 32:08.217
He shall baptize you with
the Holy Ghost and with fire,

32:08.219 --> 32:10.886
whose fan is in his hand,

32:10.888 --> 32:13.890
and he will thoroughly
purge his floor

32:13.892 --> 32:16.933
and will gather the wheat into
his garner,

32:16.935 --> 32:21.229
but the chaff he will burn
with fire unquenchable.

32:21.231 --> 32:24.025
And many other things
in his exhortation

32:24.027 --> 32:26.861
preached he unto the people.

32:26.863 --> 32:31.490
Then cometh Jesus from
Galilee to Jordan unto John

32:31.492 --> 32:33.992
to be baptized of him.

32:33.994 --> 32:36.245
But John forbade him, saying,

32:36.247 --> 32:40.460
I have need to be baptized of
thee, and comest thou to me?

32:42.628 --> 32:46.255
And Jesus answering
said unto him,

32:46.257 --> 32:49.007
suffer it to be so now,

32:49.009 --> 32:51.177
for thus it becometh us

32:51.179 --> 32:54.055
to fulfill all righteousness.

32:54.057 --> 32:56.056
Then he suffered him.

32:56.058 --> 32:58.767
And Jesus, when he was baptized,

32:58.769 --> 33:02.020
went up straightway
out of the water,

33:02.022 --> 33:05.149
and, lo, the heavens were opened
unto him

33:05.151 --> 33:09.362
and he saw the Spirit of
God descending like a dove,

33:09.364 --> 33:11.698
lighting upon him.

33:11.700 --> 33:15.159
And lo a voice from heaven,
saying,

33:15.161 --> 33:19.124
this is my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased.

33:21.125 --> 33:25.087
And Jesus himself began to
be about 30 years of age.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.965
Whoa, Pam, that's incredible!

33:28.967 --> 33:31.008
Tell us another story.

33:31.010 --> 33:34.178
Yeah, we wanna hear
more about Jesus.

33:34.180 --> 33:38.224
What about the story
of Jesus's first miracle?

33:38.226 --> 33:40.142
Would you like to hear that?

33:40.144 --> 33:41.227
Yeah!

33:41.229 --> 33:44.146
- Oh, I'd love to.
- Me too.

33:44.148 --> 33:47.941
I told you guys, Pam is
an amazing story teller.

33:47.943 --> 33:49.736
This is how it goes.

33:49.738 --> 33:53.864
And the third day there was
a marriage in Cana of Galilee

33:53.866 --> 33:56.324
and the mother of Jesus
was there.

33:56.326 --> 33:59.411
And both Jesus was
called, and his disciples,

33:59.413 --> 34:00.830
to the marriage.

34:00.832 --> 34:02.707
And when they wanted wine,

34:02.709 --> 34:06.921
the mother of Jesus saith
unto him, they have no wine.

34:07.881 --> 34:12.882
Jesus saith unto her, woman,
what have I to do with thee?

34:12.885 --> 34:15.719
Mine hour is not yet come.

34:15.722 --> 34:18.764
His mother saith unto
the servants,

34:18.766 --> 34:22.184
whatever he saith unto you,
do it.

34:22.186 --> 34:25.563
And there were set there
six water pots of stone

34:25.565 --> 34:29.150
after the manner of the
purifying of the Jews,

34:29.152 --> 34:32.362
containing two or three
firkins apiece.

34:32.364 --> 34:37.367
Jesus saith unto them, fill
the water pots with water.

34:37.369 --> 34:40.327
And they filled them
up to the brim.

34:40.329 --> 34:43.331
And he saith unto them,
draw out now

34:43.333 --> 34:46.208
and bear unto the governor of
the feast,

34:46.210 --> 34:48.753
and they will bare it.

34:48.755 --> 34:52.255
When the ruler of the
feast had tasted the water

34:52.257 --> 34:55.842
that was made wine, he
knew not whence it was,

34:55.844 --> 34:58.929
but the servants which
drew the water knew.

34:58.931 --> 35:01.474
The governor of the feast
called the bridegroom,

35:01.476 --> 35:04.976
and saith unto him, every
man at the beginning

35:04.978 --> 35:09.106
doth set forth good wine,
and when men have well drunk,

35:09.108 --> 35:11.025
then that which is worse.

35:11.027 --> 35:14.237
But thou hast kept the
good wine until now.

35:14.239 --> 35:18.365
This beginning of miracles
did Jesus in Cana of Galilee,

35:18.367 --> 35:20.992
and manifested forth his glory

35:20.994 --> 35:24.204
and his disciples
believed on him.

35:24.206 --> 35:27.124
After this he went
down to Capernaum,

35:27.126 --> 35:31.211
he and his mother, and his
brethren, and his disciples,

35:31.213 --> 35:34.632
and they continued there not
many days.

35:34.634 --> 35:37.342
And the Jews' passover
was at hand,

35:37.344 --> 35:39.845
and Jesus went up to Jerusalem

35:39.847 --> 35:43.182
and found in the temple
those that sold oxen

35:43.184 --> 35:47.519
and sheep and doves, and the
changers of money sitting.

35:47.521 --> 35:50.398
And when he had made a
scourge of small cords,

35:50.400 --> 35:53.483
he drove them all out of
the temple, and the sheep,

35:53.485 --> 35:56.362
and the oxen, and poured
out the changers' money

35:56.364 --> 35:58.238
and overthrew the tables.

35:58.240 --> 36:01.117
He said unto them
that sold doves,

36:01.119 --> 36:03.286
take these things hence.

36:03.288 --> 36:07.373
Make not my Father's house
an house of merchandise.

36:07.375 --> 36:10.543
And his disciples remembered
that it was written,

36:10.545 --> 36:14.296
the zeal of thine house hath
eaten me up.

36:14.298 --> 36:17.883
Then answered the Jews and said
unto them,

36:17.885 --> 36:20.427
what sign showest thou unto us,

36:20.429 --> 36:24.139
seeing that thou doest
these things?

36:24.141 --> 36:27.142
Jesus answered and said
unto them,

36:27.144 --> 36:32.315
destroy this temple, and in
three days I will raise it up.

36:32.317 --> 36:35.610
Then said the Jews,
40 and 60 years

36:35.612 --> 36:37.862
was this temple in building,

36:37.864 --> 36:41.324
and wilt thou rear it up in
three days?

36:41.326 --> 36:45.161
But he spake of the temple of
his body.

36:45.163 --> 36:48.498
When therefore he was risen from
the dead,

36:48.500 --> 36:52.459
his disciples remembered that
he had said this unto them,

36:52.461 --> 36:55.505
and they believed the scripture

36:55.507 --> 36:58.508
and the word which
Jesus had said.

36:58.510 --> 37:01.594
Now when he was in
Jerusalem at the passover

37:01.596 --> 37:05.139
in the feast day, many
believed in his name

37:05.141 --> 37:08.351
when they saw the miracles
which he did.

37:08.353 --> 37:11.979
But Jesus did not commit
himself unto them,

37:11.981 --> 37:13.898
because he knew all men

37:13.900 --> 37:17.526
and needed not what they
should testify of man

37:17.528 --> 37:19.947
for he knew what was in man.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.574
Whoa, awesome!

37:23.367 --> 37:26.369
I love that story so much.

37:26.371 --> 37:28.537
Will you tell us another one?

37:28.539 --> 37:30.539
Yeah Pam, please?

37:30.541 --> 37:35.211
Sure, I'll tell you the
story of the woman at the well.

37:35.213 --> 37:36.378
Great.

37:36.380 --> 37:37.505
How does it go?

37:37.507 --> 37:40.842
When therefore the Lord
knew how the Pharisees

37:40.844 --> 37:42.885
had heard that Jesus made

37:42.887 --> 37:45.972
and baptized more disciples
than John,

37:45.974 --> 37:49.891
though Jesus himself baptized
not, but his disciples,

37:49.893 --> 37:54.188
he left Judaea, and
departed again into Galilee.

37:54.190 --> 37:57.191
And he must need
go through Samaria.

37:57.193 --> 38:02.112
Then cometh he to a city of
Samaria which is called Sychar,

38:02.114 --> 38:04.407
near to the parcel of ground

38:04.409 --> 38:07.409
that Jacob gave to
his son Joseph.

38:07.411 --> 38:10.079
Now Jacob's well was there.

38:10.081 --> 38:13.583
Jesus therefore being
wearied with his journey,

38:13.585 --> 38:18.420
sat thus on the well, and
it was about the sixth hour.

38:18.422 --> 38:22.467
There cometh a woman of
Samaria to draw water.

38:22.469 --> 38:25.845
Jesus saith unto her,
give me a drink.

38:25.847 --> 38:30.057
For his disciples were gone
away unto the city to buy meat.

38:30.059 --> 38:33.394
Then saith the woman of Samaria
unto him,

38:33.396 --> 38:37.940
how is it that thou, being
a Jew, askest drink of me,

38:37.942 --> 38:40.650
which am a woman of Samaria?

38:40.652 --> 38:44.655
For the Jews have no
dealings with the Samaritans.

38:44.657 --> 38:47.532
Jesus answered and said
unto her,

38:47.534 --> 38:49.911
if thou knewest the gift of God

38:49.913 --> 38:54.039
and who it is that saith
to thee, give me to drink,

38:54.041 --> 38:56.501
thou wouldest have asked of him

38:56.503 --> 39:00.003
and he would have given thee
living water.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.382
The woman saith unto him,

39:02.384 --> 39:07.010
sir, thou hast nothing to draw
with, and the well is deep.

39:07.012 --> 39:10.682
From whence then hast
thou that living water?

39:10.684 --> 39:13.767
Art thou greater than our
father Jacob,

39:13.769 --> 39:18.356
which gave us the well,
and drank thereof himself

39:18.358 --> 39:21.650
and his children,
and his cattle?

39:21.652 --> 39:24.445
Jesus answered and
said unto her,

39:24.447 --> 39:28.782
whosoever drinketh of this
water shall thirst again.

39:28.784 --> 39:31.369
But whoever drinketh
of the water

39:31.371 --> 39:34.664
that I shall give him shall
never thirst,

39:34.666 --> 39:36.874
but the water that I
shall give him

39:36.876 --> 39:39.543
shall be in him a well of water

39:39.545 --> 39:43.755
springing up into the
everlasting life.

39:43.757 --> 39:47.635
The woman saith unto him,
sir, give me this water

39:47.637 --> 39:51.516
that I thirst not, neither
come hither to draw.

39:52.766 --> 39:56.980
Jesus saith unto her, go, call
thy husband, and come hither.

39:58.106 --> 40:01.858
The woman answered and
said, I have no husband.

40:01.860 --> 40:06.487
Jesus said unto her, thou hast
well said, I have no husband,

40:06.489 --> 40:09.365
for thou hast had five husbands,

40:09.367 --> 40:13.452
and whom thou now hast is not
thy husband.

40:13.454 --> 40:16.164
In that saidst thou truly.

40:16.166 --> 40:18.708
The woman saith unto him,

40:18.710 --> 40:22.628
sir, I perceive that thou
art a prophet.

40:22.630 --> 40:25.505
Our fathers worshiped
in this mountain,

40:25.507 --> 40:28.008
and ye say, that in Jerusalem is
the place

40:28.010 --> 40:30.720
where men ought to worship.

40:30.722 --> 40:34.557
Jesus saith unto her, woman,
believe me,

40:34.559 --> 40:38.769
the hour cometh when ye shall
neither in this mountain

40:38.771 --> 40:42.856
nor yet at Jerusalem,
worship the Father.

40:42.858 --> 40:45.735
Ye worship ye know not what.

40:45.737 --> 40:50.530
We know what we worship, for
salvation is of the Jews.

40:50.532 --> 40:52.950
But the hour cometh, and now is,

40:52.952 --> 40:56.287
when the true worshipers
shall worship the Father

40:56.289 --> 40:58.706
in spirit and in truth,

40:58.708 --> 41:02.251
for the Father seeketh
such to worship him.

41:02.253 --> 41:05.588
God is a Spirit and they that
worship him

41:05.590 --> 41:09.300
must worship him in spirit and
in truth.

41:09.302 --> 41:14.222
The woman saith unto him,
I know that Messias cometh,

41:14.224 --> 41:17.599
which is called Christ,
and when he is come

41:17.601 --> 41:20.144
he will tell us all things.

41:20.146 --> 41:24.359
Jesus saith unto her, I
that speak unto thee am he.

41:25.860 --> 41:29.112
And upon this came his
disciples,

41:29.114 --> 41:32.572
and marveled that he
talked with the woman.

41:32.574 --> 41:35.367
Yet no man said,
what seekest thou?

41:35.369 --> 41:38.371
Or, why talkest thou with her?

41:38.373 --> 41:40.999
The woman then left
her water pot

41:41.001 --> 41:45.211
and went her way into the
city, and saith to the men,

41:45.213 --> 41:50.048
come, see a man, which told
me all things that ever I did.

41:50.050 --> 41:52.677
Is not this the Christ?

41:52.679 --> 41:56.722
Then they went out of the
city, and came unto him.

41:56.724 --> 42:00.226
In the meanwhile his disciples
prayed him,

42:00.228 --> 42:01.813
saying, Master, eat.

42:02.981 --> 42:06.733
But he said unto them, I have
meat to eat

42:06.735 --> 42:08.568
that ye know not of.

42:08.570 --> 42:11.695
Therefore said the
disciples one to another,

42:11.697 --> 42:15.240
hath any man brought him ought
to eat?

42:15.242 --> 42:19.829
Jesus saith unto them, my
meat is to do the will of him

42:19.831 --> 42:23.416
that sent me,
and to finish his work.

42:23.418 --> 42:26.461
Say not ye, there are
yet four months

42:26.463 --> 42:28.880
and then cometh harvest?

42:28.882 --> 42:32.090
Behold, I say unto you,
lift up your eyes

42:32.092 --> 42:34.385
and look on the fields

42:34.387 --> 42:37.472
for they are white
already to harvest.

42:37.474 --> 42:40.307
And he that reapeth
receiveth wages

42:40.309 --> 42:43.436
and gathereth fruit
unto life eternal,

42:43.438 --> 42:45.438
that both he that soweth

42:45.440 --> 42:49.525
and he that reapeth may
rejoice together.

42:49.527 --> 42:52.320
And herein is that saying true,

42:52.322 --> 42:55.030
one soweth and another reapeth.

42:55.032 --> 42:59.659
I sent you to reap that
whereon ye bestowed no labor,

42:59.661 --> 43:04.164
other men laboured, and ye are
entered into their labours.

43:04.166 --> 43:08.503
And many of the Samaritans
of that city believed on him

43:08.505 --> 43:12.340
for the saying of the
woman, which testified,

43:12.342 --> 43:15.385
he told me all that ever I did.

43:15.387 --> 43:18.887
So when the Samaritans were come
unto him,

43:18.889 --> 43:22.349
they besought him that
he would tarry with them,

43:22.351 --> 43:25.019
and he abode there two days.

43:25.021 --> 43:28.106
And many more believed of his
own word

43:28.108 --> 43:32.275
and said unto the woman,
now we believe,

43:32.277 --> 43:34.695
not because of thy saying,

43:34.697 --> 43:37.865
for which we have
heard him ourselves

43:37.867 --> 43:41.034
and know that this is
indeed the Christ,

43:41.036 --> 43:43.579
the Savior of the world.

43:43.581 --> 43:45.831
Tell us another story, Pam!

43:45.833 --> 43:46.791
Yeah!

43:46.793 --> 43:48.918
Please?

43:48.920 --> 43:52.630
Okay, oh.

43:52.632 --> 43:56.842
And Jesus came to Nazareth,
where he had been brought up,

43:56.844 --> 44:00.804
and, as his custom was,
he went into the synagogue

44:00.806 --> 44:04.099
on the sabbath day,
and stood up to read.

44:04.101 --> 44:06.686
And there was delivered unto him

44:06.688 --> 44:09.021
the book of the prophet Esaias.

44:09.023 --> 44:11.315
And when he had opened the book,

44:11.317 --> 44:14.401
he found the place
where it was written,

44:14.403 --> 44:17.112
the Spirit of the Lord
is upon me,

44:17.114 --> 44:19.282
because he hath anointed me

44:19.284 --> 44:21.950
to preach the gospel
to the poor.

44:21.952 --> 44:25.579
He hath sent me to
heal the brokenhearted,

44:25.581 --> 44:28.666
to preach deliverance
to the captives,

44:28.668 --> 44:31.836
and recovering of sight
to the blind,

44:31.838 --> 44:35.088
to set at liberty them
that are bruised,

44:35.090 --> 44:38.885
to preach the acceptable
year of the Lord.

44:38.887 --> 44:43.180
And he closed the book and
gave it again to the minister,

44:43.182 --> 44:44.766
and sat down.

44:44.768 --> 44:48.853
And the eyes of all them
that were in the synagogue

44:48.855 --> 44:50.646
were fastened on him.

44:50.648 --> 44:52.856
And he began to say unto them,

44:52.858 --> 44:57.695
this day is this scripture
fulfilled in your ears.

44:57.697 --> 44:59.905
And all bare him witness,

44:59.907 --> 45:02.867
and wondered at the
gracious words

45:02.869 --> 45:05.244
which proceeded
out of his mouth.

45:05.246 --> 45:08.914
And they said, is not this
Joseph's son?

45:08.916 --> 45:12.959
And he said unto them, ye
will surely say unto me

45:12.961 --> 45:17.005
this proverb, physician,
heal thyself,

45:17.007 --> 45:20.842
whatsoever we have
heard done in Capernaum,

45:20.844 --> 45:23.013
do also here in thy country.

45:24.099 --> 45:27.599
And he said,
verily I say unto you,

45:27.601 --> 45:31.561
no prophet is accepted in his
own country.

45:31.563 --> 45:33.856
But I tell you of a truth,

45:33.858 --> 45:37.943
many widows were in Israel
in the days of Elias,

45:37.945 --> 45:41.655
when the heaven was shut up
three years and six months,

45:41.657 --> 45:45.117
when great famine was
throughout all the land.

45:45.119 --> 45:48.496
But unto none of them was
Elias sent,

45:48.498 --> 45:51.749
save unto Sarepta,
a city of Sidon,

45:51.751 --> 45:54.711
unto a woman that was a widow.

45:54.713 --> 45:58.923
And many lepers were in
Israel in the time of Eliseus

45:58.925 --> 46:02.342
the prophet, and none
of them was cleansed,

46:02.344 --> 46:05.137
saving Naaman the Syrian.

46:05.139 --> 46:07.682
And all they in the synagogue,

46:07.684 --> 46:10.851
when they heard these things,
were filled with wrath,

46:10.853 --> 46:14.229
and rose up, and thrust
him out of the city

46:14.231 --> 46:16.941
and led him unto the
brow of the hill

46:16.943 --> 46:19.235
whereon their city was built,

46:19.237 --> 46:22.320
that they might cast him
down headlong.

46:22.322 --> 46:26.493
But he passing through the
midst of them went his way.

46:27.746 --> 46:30.246
This is totally cool,
you guys.

46:30.248 --> 46:31.414
I know!

46:31.416 --> 46:34.416
I'm so happy you're having fun,
Tammy.

46:34.418 --> 46:36.626
I have a Bible story
for you guys.

46:36.628 --> 46:38.086
Guess which one it is?

46:38.088 --> 46:39.880
Give us a clue, Jimmy.

46:39.882 --> 46:42.050
Yeah, give us a clue.

46:42.052 --> 46:44.302
It's about a miracle.

46:44.304 --> 46:45.635
Oh, I got it.

46:45.637 --> 46:47.972
Jesus heals on the Sabbath.

46:47.974 --> 46:49.891
Try again, guys!

46:49.893 --> 46:52.934
Is it the miracle of
the draught of the fishes?

46:52.936 --> 46:54.228
Yeah, that's it!

46:54.230 --> 46:56.356
Tell us the story, Jimmy.

46:56.358 --> 46:58.398
This is how it goes.

46:58.400 --> 47:00.193
And it came to pass that,

47:00.195 --> 47:03.070
as the people pressed upon
him to hear the word of God,

47:03.072 --> 47:05.030
he stood by the
lake of Gennesaret

47:05.032 --> 47:07.867
and saw two ships standing by
the lake.

47:07.869 --> 47:09.994
But the fishermen were
gone out of them

47:09.996 --> 47:11.912
and were washing their nets.

47:11.914 --> 47:14.624
And he entered into one of
the ships, which was Simon's,

47:14.626 --> 47:16.208
and prayed him that he
would thrust out

47:16.210 --> 47:17.751
a little from the land.

47:17.753 --> 47:20.295
And he sat down, and he taught
the people out of the ship.

47:20.297 --> 47:23.633
Now when he had left
speaking, he said unto Simon,

47:23.635 --> 47:25.385
launch out into the deep,

47:25.387 --> 47:27.302
and let down your
nets for a draught.

47:27.304 --> 47:29.805
And Simon answering
said unto him,

47:29.807 --> 47:32.391
master, we have toiled
all the night

47:32.393 --> 47:34.226
and have taken nothing,

47:34.228 --> 47:38.021
Nevertheless at thy word
I will let down the net.

47:38.023 --> 47:39.731
And when they had this done,

47:39.733 --> 47:42.901
they enclosed a great
multitude of fishes,

47:42.903 --> 47:44.403
and their net brake.

47:44.405 --> 47:46.030
And they beckoned
unto their partners,

47:46.032 --> 47:47.115
which were in the other ship,

47:47.117 --> 47:48.950
that they should come
and help them.

47:48.952 --> 47:51.369
And they came and filled both
the ships

47:51.371 --> 47:53.537
so that they began to sink.

47:53.539 --> 47:56.541
When Simon Peter saw it, he
fell down at Jesus' knees,

47:56.543 --> 48:00.628
saying, depart from me, for
I am a sinful man, oh Lord.

48:00.630 --> 48:04.048
For he was astonished,
and all that were with him

48:04.050 --> 48:07.135
at the draught of the
fishes which they had taken.

48:07.137 --> 48:11.304
And so was also James, and
John, the sons of Zebedee,

48:11.306 --> 48:13.266
which were partners with Simon.

48:13.268 --> 48:15.976
And Jesus said unto Simon,
fear not,

48:15.978 --> 48:19.146
from henceforth thou shalt
catch men.

48:19.148 --> 48:21.231
And when they had brought
their ships to land,

48:21.233 --> 48:24.153
they forsook all,
and followed him.

48:24.987 --> 48:27.362
Wait, I know another awesome
Bible story

48:27.364 --> 48:29.865
about Jesus performing miracles.

48:29.867 --> 48:31.200
Tell us, Tammy.

48:31.202 --> 48:34.037
This is how it begins.

48:34.039 --> 48:36.289
And they went into Capernaum,

48:36.291 --> 48:38.749
and straightway on the
sabbath day

48:38.751 --> 48:41.461
Jesus entered into the
synagogue and taught.

48:41.463 --> 48:43.880
And they were astonished
at his doctrine,

48:43.882 --> 48:46.923
for he taught them as
one that had authority

48:46.925 --> 48:48.760
and not as the scribes.

48:48.762 --> 48:50.427
And there was in their synagogue

48:50.429 --> 48:53.722
a man with unclean
spirit, and he cried out,

48:53.724 --> 48:57.434
saying, let us alone, what
have we to do with thee,

48:57.436 --> 48:59.311
thou Jesus of Nazareth?

48:59.313 --> 49:01.646
Art thou come to destroy us?

49:01.648 --> 49:05.776
I know thee who thou
art, the Holy One of God.

49:05.778 --> 49:08.237
And Jesus rebuked him, saying,

49:08.239 --> 49:11.199
hold thy peace,
and come out of him.

49:11.201 --> 49:14.117
And when the unclean spirit had
torn him

49:14.119 --> 49:18.121
and cried with a loud
voice, he came out of him.

49:18.123 --> 49:21.958
And they were all amazed,
insomuch that they questioned

49:21.960 --> 49:25.630
among themselves, saying,
what thing is this?

49:25.632 --> 49:27.673
What new doctrine is this?

49:27.675 --> 49:31.844
For with authority commandeth
he even the unclean spirits,

49:31.846 --> 49:33.554
and they do obey him.

49:33.556 --> 49:35.932
And immediately his fame
spread abroad

49:35.934 --> 49:38.726
throughout all the region
round about Galilee.

49:38.728 --> 49:41.896
And forthwith, when they were
come out of the synagogue,

49:41.898 --> 49:44.231
they entered into the
house of Simon and Andrew

49:44.233 --> 49:45.775
with James and John.

49:45.777 --> 49:48.610
But Simon's wife's mother
lay sick of a fever,

49:48.612 --> 49:50.905
and anon they tell him of her.

49:50.907 --> 49:52.907
And he came and took
her by the hand,

49:52.909 --> 49:56.369
and lifted her up, and
immediately the fever left her,

49:56.371 --> 49:58.704
and she ministered unto them.

49:58.706 --> 50:01.416
And at even,
when the sun did set,

50:01.418 --> 50:04.293
they brought unto him
all that were diseased

50:04.295 --> 50:07.130
and them that were possessed
with devils.

50:07.132 --> 50:10.133
And all the city was gathered
together at the door.

50:10.135 --> 50:12.969
And he healed many that
were sick of diseases,

50:12.971 --> 50:14.970
and cast out many devils,

50:14.972 --> 50:20.142
and suffered not the devils to
speak, because they knew him.

50:20.144 --> 50:24.063
And in the morning, rising
up a great while before day,

50:24.065 --> 50:27.733
he went out, and departed
into a solitary place

50:27.735 --> 50:29.318
and there prayed.

50:29.320 --> 50:33.238
And Simon and they that were
with him followed after him.

50:33.240 --> 50:36.159
And when they had found
him, they said unto him,

50:36.161 --> 50:38.161
all men seek for thee.

50:38.163 --> 50:41.873
And he said unto them, let
us go into the next towns

50:41.875 --> 50:46.501
that I may preach there also,
for therefore came I forth.

50:46.503 --> 50:48.420
And he preached
in their synagogues

50:48.422 --> 50:53.300
throughout all Galilee,
and cast out devils.

50:53.302 --> 50:56.304
And there came a leper
to him, beseeching him

50:56.306 --> 50:59.682
and kneeling down to
him, and saying unto him,

50:59.684 --> 51:03.436
if thou wilt, thou canst
make me clean.

51:03.438 --> 51:06.271
And Jesus, moved with
compassion,

51:06.273 --> 51:09.108
put forth his hand
and touched him,

51:09.110 --> 51:13.153
and saith unto him, I will,
be thou clean.

51:13.155 --> 51:15.238
And as soon as he had spoken,

51:15.240 --> 51:18.409
immediately the leprosy departed
from him

51:18.411 --> 51:20.202
and he was cleansed.

51:20.204 --> 51:23.914
And he straitly charged him,
and forthwith sent him away

51:23.916 --> 51:27.959
and saith unto him, see
thou say nothing to any man,

51:27.961 --> 51:31.296
but go thy way, shew
thyself to the priest,

51:31.298 --> 51:34.383
and offer for thy cleansing
those things

51:34.385 --> 51:37.970
which Moses commanded,
for a testimony unto them.

51:37.972 --> 51:41.099
But he went out, and
began to publish it much,

51:41.101 --> 51:43.226
and to blaze abroad the matter,

51:43.228 --> 51:46.186
insomuch that Jesus could
no more openly enter

51:46.188 --> 51:49.731
into the city, but was
without in desert places,

51:49.733 --> 51:52.443
and they came to him from
every quarter.

51:52.445 --> 51:56.155
And again he entered into
Capernaum after some days,

51:56.157 --> 51:58.782
and it was noised that
he was in the house,

51:58.784 --> 52:00.909
and straightway many
were gathered together

52:00.911 --> 52:04.079
insomuch that there was
no room to receive them,

52:04.081 --> 52:06.874
no, not so much as
about the door,

52:06.876 --> 52:09.501
and he preached the
word unto them.

52:09.503 --> 52:13.005
And they come unto him,
bringing one sick of the palsy,

52:13.007 --> 52:14.923
which was borne of four.

52:14.925 --> 52:17.969
And when they could not come
nigh unto him for the press,

52:17.971 --> 52:20.345
they uncovered the roof
where he was.

52:20.347 --> 52:23.432
And when they had broken it
up, they let down the bed

52:23.434 --> 52:25.684
wherein the sick
of the palsy lay.

52:25.686 --> 52:27.603
When Jesus saw their faith,

52:27.605 --> 52:30.313
he said unto the sick
of the palsy,

52:30.315 --> 52:32.691
son, thy sins be forgiven thee.

52:32.693 --> 52:36.028
But there were certain of
the scribes sitting there,

52:36.030 --> 52:38.113
and reasoning in their hearts,

52:38.115 --> 52:41.117
why doth this man
thus speak blasphemies?

52:41.119 --> 52:43.786
Who can forgive sins
but God only?

52:43.788 --> 52:46.789
And immediately when Jesus
perceived in his spirit

52:46.791 --> 52:49.249
that they so reasoned within
themselves,

52:49.251 --> 52:50.501
he said unto them,

52:50.503 --> 52:53.545
why reason ye these things in
your hearts?

52:53.547 --> 52:56.715
Whether is it easier to say
to the sick of the palsy,

52:56.717 --> 52:59.677
thy sins be forgiven thee,
or to say,

52:59.679 --> 53:02.764
arise, and take up thy bed,
and walk?

53:02.766 --> 53:05.307
But that ye may know that the
Son of man

53:05.309 --> 53:07.601
hath power on earth
to forgive sins,

53:07.603 --> 53:10.438
he saith to the sick
of the palsy.

53:10.440 --> 53:14.483
I say unto thee, arise,
and take up thy bed,

53:14.485 --> 53:17.362
and go thy way into thine house.

53:17.364 --> 53:20.530
And immediately he arose,
took up the bed,

53:20.532 --> 53:22.992
and went forth before them all,

53:22.994 --> 53:26.871
insomuch that they were all
amazed and glorified God,

53:26.873 --> 53:30.124
saying, we never saw it
on this fashion.

53:30.126 --> 53:33.293
And he went forth again
by the sea side,

53:33.295 --> 53:37.757
and all the multitude resorted
unto him, and he taught them.

53:37.759 --> 53:41.802
And as he passed by, he saw
Levi the son of Alphaeus

53:41.804 --> 53:44.097
sitting at the
receipt of custom,

53:44.099 --> 53:46.432
and said unto him, follow me.

53:46.434 --> 53:48.934
And he arose and followed him.

53:48.936 --> 53:52.979
And it came to pass, that as
Jesus sat at meat in his house,

53:52.981 --> 53:56.150
many publicans and
sinners sat also together

53:56.152 --> 53:58.443
with Jesus and his disciples,

53:58.445 --> 54:01.322
for there were many,
and they followed him.

54:01.324 --> 54:04.157
And when the scribes and
Pharisees saw him eat

54:04.159 --> 54:06.077
with the publicans and sinners,

54:06.079 --> 54:08.121
they said unto his disciples,

54:08.123 --> 54:10.331
how is it that he
eateth and drinketh

54:10.333 --> 54:12.291
with publicans and sinners?

54:12.293 --> 54:15.378
When Jesus heard it, he saith
unto them,

54:15.380 --> 54:18.380
they that are whole have
no need of the physician,

54:18.382 --> 54:20.508
but they that are sick.

54:20.510 --> 54:24.472
I came not to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance.

54:25.389 --> 54:28.307
- Wow!
- Amazing story, Tammy.

54:28.309 --> 54:30.392
Hey guys,
look over there.

54:30.394 --> 54:32.019
What is it, Jimmy?

54:32.021 --> 54:33.146
It's Sam.

54:33.148 --> 54:34.188
Who is Sam?

54:34.190 --> 54:36.398
Sam is a super cool
friend of ours

54:36.400 --> 54:37.941
who lives in Bible Town.

54:37.943 --> 54:41.195
He tells really awesome stories.

54:41.197 --> 54:43.113
Are we gonna visit him, guys?

54:43.115 --> 54:45.490
Yeah, let's go see Sam.

54:45.492 --> 54:49.119
He's gonna have a
great story for us, I'm sure.

54:52.625 --> 54:54.583
Hey guys, so cool to see you.

54:54.585 --> 54:56.251
Hey Sam, what's happenin'?

54:56.253 --> 54:59.255
Did you come to hear
some amazing Bible stories?

54:59.257 --> 55:00.213
Yeah.

55:00.215 --> 55:02.467
Are you gonna tell us a story,
Sam?

55:02.469 --> 55:05.052
Yeah, which story would
you like to hear, guys?

55:05.054 --> 55:07.347
What about another
miracle story?

55:07.349 --> 55:08.347
Sure guys.

55:08.349 --> 55:09.932
Have you heard of this one?

55:09.934 --> 55:12.309
When he had ended all his
sayings in the audience

55:12.311 --> 55:14.896
of the people, Jesus
entered into Capernaum.

55:14.898 --> 55:17.898
And a certain centurion's
servant, who was dear unto him,

55:17.900 --> 55:19.650
was sick, and ready to die.

55:19.652 --> 55:21.276
And when he heard of Jesus,

55:21.278 --> 55:23.237
he sent unto him the elders of
the Jews

55:23.239 --> 55:25.907
beseeching him that he would
come and heal his servant.

55:25.909 --> 55:27.742
And when they came to Jesus

55:27.744 --> 55:30.036
they besought him
instantly, saying

55:30.038 --> 55:32.496
that he was worthy for
whom he should do this.

55:32.498 --> 55:36.541
For he loveth our nation, and
he hath built us a synagogue.

55:36.543 --> 55:38.461
Then Jesus went with them.

55:38.463 --> 55:39.878
And when he was now not far,

55:39.880 --> 55:42.798
saying unto him, Lord,
trouble not thyself,

55:42.800 --> 55:46.094
for I am not worthy that thou
shouldest enter under my roof.

55:46.096 --> 55:49.012
Wherefore neither thought I
myself worthy to come unto thee,

55:49.014 --> 55:51.474
but say in a word, and my
servant shall be healed.

55:51.476 --> 55:53.642
For I also am a man
set under authority,

55:53.644 --> 55:56.604
having under me soldiers,
and I say unto one,

55:56.606 --> 56:01.191
go, and he goeth, and to
another, come, and he cometh,

56:01.193 --> 56:05.320
and to my servant, do
this, and he doeth it.

56:05.322 --> 56:08.365
When Jesus heard these
things, he marveled at him

56:08.367 --> 56:10.617
and turned him about,
and said unto the people

56:10.619 --> 56:13.329
that followed him,
I say unto you,

56:13.331 --> 56:17.249
I have not found so great
faith, no, not in Israel.

56:17.251 --> 56:19.668
And they that were sent
returning to the house,

56:19.670 --> 56:22.005
found the servant whole
that had been sick.

56:22.007 --> 56:23.798
And it came to pass
the day after

56:23.800 --> 56:25.842
that he went into a city
called Nain

56:25.844 --> 56:29.762
and many of his disciples went
with him, and much people.

56:29.764 --> 56:32.347
Now when he came nigh
to the gate of the city,

56:32.349 --> 56:35.184
behold, there was a dead man
carried out,

56:35.186 --> 56:38.061
the only son of his mother,
and she was a widow,

56:38.063 --> 56:40.606
and much people of the city was
with her.

56:40.608 --> 56:43.608
And when the Lord saw her,
he had compassion on her

56:43.610 --> 56:45.987
and said unto her, weep not.

56:45.989 --> 56:48.488
And he came
and touched the bier,

56:48.490 --> 56:51.034
and they that bare
him stood still.

56:51.036 --> 56:55.454
And he said, young man,
I say unto thee, arise.

56:55.456 --> 56:58.541
And he that was dead sat
up and began to speak.

56:58.543 --> 57:01.084
And he delivered
him to his mother.

57:01.086 --> 57:03.503
And there came a fear on all,

57:03.505 --> 57:05.798
and they glorified God, saying,

57:05.800 --> 57:08.300
a great prophet is
risen up among us.

57:08.302 --> 57:10.510
God hath visited his people.

57:10.512 --> 57:14.097
And this rumor of him went
forth throughout all Judaea,

57:14.099 --> 57:16.516
and throughout all the region
round about.

57:16.518 --> 57:19.644
Now when John had heard in the
prison the works of Christ,

57:19.646 --> 57:22.690
he sent two of his
disciples, and said unto him,

57:22.692 --> 57:26.735
art thou he that should come,
or do we look for another?

57:26.737 --> 57:28.862
Jesus answered and said
unto them,

57:28.864 --> 57:30.822
go and shew John again
those things

57:30.824 --> 57:32.657
which ye do hear and see.

57:32.659 --> 57:35.161
The blind receive their
sight, and the lame walk,

57:35.163 --> 57:37.954
the lepers are cleansed,
and the deaf hear,

57:37.956 --> 57:39.666
the dead are raised up,
and the poor

57:39.668 --> 57:41.583
have the gospel
preached to them.

57:41.585 --> 57:45.420
And blessed is he, whosoever
shall not be offended in me.

57:45.422 --> 57:47.632
And as they departed, Jesus
began to say

57:47.634 --> 57:49.592
unto the multitudes
concerning John,

57:49.594 --> 57:52.552
what went ye out into
the wilderness to see?

57:52.554 --> 57:54.429
A reed shaken with the wind?

57:54.431 --> 57:56.264
But what went ye out for to see?

57:56.266 --> 57:58.517
A man clothed in soft raiment?

57:58.519 --> 58:02.229
Behold, they that wear soft
clothing are in kings' houses.

58:02.231 --> 58:04.606
But what went ye out for to see?

58:04.608 --> 58:05.858
A prophet?

58:05.860 --> 58:09.695
Yea, I say unto you,
and more than a prophet.

58:09.697 --> 58:12.115
For this is he,
of whom it is written,

58:12.117 --> 58:15.075
behold, I send my
messenger before thy face,

58:15.077 --> 58:17.619
which shall prepare thy way
before thee.

58:17.621 --> 58:21.289
Verily I say unto you, among
them that are born of women

58:21.291 --> 58:24.668
there hath not risen a
greater than John the Baptist,

58:24.670 --> 58:26.295
notwithstanding he that is least

58:26.297 --> 58:28.755
in the kingdom of heaven
is greater than he.

58:28.757 --> 58:31.425
And from the days of John
the Baptist until now

58:31.427 --> 58:33.510
the kingdom of heaven
suffereth violence,

58:33.512 --> 58:35.595
and the violent take
it by force.

58:35.597 --> 58:39.307
For all the prophets and the
law prophesied until John.

58:39.309 --> 58:42.478
And if ye will receive it,
this is Elias,

58:42.480 --> 58:44.271
which was for to come.

58:44.273 --> 58:47.025
He that hath ears to hear,
let him hear.

58:47.027 --> 58:49.860
But whereunto shall I
liken this generation?

58:49.862 --> 58:52.487
It is like unto children
sitting in the markets

58:52.489 --> 58:54.407
and calling unto their fellows,

58:54.409 --> 58:57.744
and saying, we have piped unto
you, and ye have not danced.

58:57.746 --> 59:01.371
We have mourned unto you,
and ye have not lamented.

59:01.373 --> 59:03.749
For John came neither
eating nor drinking,

59:03.751 --> 59:06.084
and they say, he hath a devil.

59:06.086 --> 59:08.503
The Son of man came
eating and drinking,

59:08.505 --> 59:12.383
and they say, behold a man
gluttonous, and a winebibber,

59:12.385 --> 59:15.094
a friend of publicans
and sinners.

59:15.096 --> 59:17.847
But wisdom is justified
of her children.

59:17.849 --> 59:19.639
Then began he to
upbraid the cities

59:19.641 --> 59:21.684
wherein most of his
mighty works were done,

59:21.686 --> 59:23.686
because they repented not.

59:23.688 --> 59:25.688
Woe unto thee, Chorazin.

59:25.690 --> 59:27.690
Woe unto thee, Bethsaida.

59:27.692 --> 59:29.900
For if the mighty works
which were done in you,

59:29.902 --> 59:32.070
had been done in Tyre and Sidon,

59:32.072 --> 59:36.240
they would have repented long
ago in sackcloth and ashes.

59:36.242 --> 59:39.242
But I say unto you, it
shall be more tolerable

59:39.244 --> 59:42.829
for Tyre and Sidon at the day
of judgment, than for you.

59:42.831 --> 59:46.501
And thou, Capernaum, which
art exalted unto heaven,

59:46.503 --> 59:48.711
shalt be brought down to hell,

59:48.713 --> 59:51.296
for if the mighty works
which have been done in thee

59:51.298 --> 59:52.965
had been done in Sodom,

59:52.967 --> 59:54.925
it would have remained until
this day.

59:54.927 --> 59:57.845
But I say unto you that
it shall be more tolerable

59:57.847 --> 01:00:00.889
for the land of Sodom in the
day of judgment, than for thee.

01:00:00.891 --> 01:00:04.101
At that time Jesus answered
and said, I thank thee,

01:00:04.103 --> 01:00:06.061
oh Father, Lord of
heaven and earth,

01:00:06.063 --> 01:00:07.771
because thou hast
hid these things

01:00:07.773 --> 01:00:09.606
from the wise and prudent,

01:00:09.608 --> 01:00:11.608
and hast revealed
them unto babes.

01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:15.320
Even so, Father, for so it
seemed good in thy sight.

01:00:15.322 --> 01:00:17.949
All things are delivered
unto me of my Father.

01:00:17.951 --> 01:00:20.409
No man knoweth the Son
but the Father,

01:00:20.411 --> 01:00:22.869
neither knoweth any man
the Father, save the Son,

01:00:22.871 --> 01:00:25.706
and he to whomsoever
the Son will reveal him.

01:00:25.708 --> 01:00:28.751
Come unto me, all ye that
labor and are heavy laden,

01:00:28.753 --> 01:00:30.711
and I will give you rest.

01:00:30.713 --> 01:00:33.213
Take my yoke upon you,
and learn of me

01:00:33.215 --> 01:00:35.550
for I am meek
and lowly in heart,

01:00:35.552 --> 01:00:37.969
and ye shall find rest
unto your souls.

01:00:37.971 --> 01:00:40.470
For my yoke is easy,
and my burden is light.

01:00:40.472 --> 01:00:41.722
Awesome.

01:00:41.724 --> 01:00:44.599
What about the miracle
of loaves and fishes?

01:00:44.601 --> 01:00:46.394
That's an amazing story.

01:00:46.396 --> 01:00:48.271
Can you tell us that one?

01:00:48.273 --> 01:00:50.648
Wait, I know that story.

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:52.816
Let me tell it to you.

01:00:52.818 --> 01:00:55.153
All right, Sarah, go ahead.

01:00:55.155 --> 01:00:56.778
It goes like this.

01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:00.365
When Jesus heard of the
death of John the Baptist,

01:01:00.367 --> 01:01:04.327
he departed thence by ship
into a desert place apart,

01:01:04.329 --> 01:01:07.248
and when the people
had heard thereof,

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:10.793
they followed him on
foot out of the cities.

01:01:10.795 --> 01:01:15.715
And Jesus went forth and
saw a great multitude,

01:01:15.717 --> 01:01:18.675
and was moved with compassion
toward them,

01:01:18.677 --> 01:01:20.595
and he healed their sick.

01:01:20.597 --> 01:01:24.557
And when it was evening, his
disciples came to him, saying,

01:01:24.559 --> 01:01:28.519
this is a desert place,
and the time is now past.

01:01:28.521 --> 01:01:32.315
Send the multitude away, that
they may go into the villages,

01:01:32.317 --> 01:01:34.816
and buy themselves victuals.

01:01:34.818 --> 01:01:38.780
But Jesus said unto them,
they need not depart.

01:01:38.782 --> 01:01:40.990
Give ye them to eat.

01:01:40.992 --> 01:01:45.077
And they say unto him, we
have here but five loaves,

01:01:45.079 --> 01:01:46.373
and two fishes.

01:01:47.331 --> 01:01:50.416
He said, bring them
hither to me.

01:01:50.418 --> 01:01:54.128
And he commanded the multitude
to sit down on the grass,

01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:57.090
and took the five loaves
and the two fishes,

01:01:57.092 --> 01:02:00.717
and looking up to heaven,
he blessed, and brake,

01:02:00.719 --> 01:02:03.304
and gave the loaves
to his disciples,

01:02:03.306 --> 01:02:06.391
and the disciples
to the multitude.

01:02:06.393 --> 01:02:09.394
And they did all eat,
and were filled,

01:02:09.396 --> 01:02:11.979
and they took up
of the fragments

01:02:11.981 --> 01:02:14.609
that remained 12 baskets full.

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:20.362
And they that had eaten
were about 5,000 men,

01:02:20.364 --> 01:02:22.865
besides women and children.

01:02:22.867 --> 01:02:24.575
I know what happens next.

01:02:24.577 --> 01:02:26.619
Jesus walks on water!

01:02:26.621 --> 01:02:27.954
Wait, Jimmy.

01:02:27.956 --> 01:02:30.414
Let Tammy tell the story
from the beginning.

01:02:30.416 --> 01:02:32.208
How does it go, Tammy?

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:34.836
It starts like this.

01:02:34.838 --> 01:02:37.588
And straightway Jesus
constrained his disciples

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:40.048
to get into a ship, and to go
before him

01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:43.970
unto the other side, while
he sent the multitudes away

01:02:43.972 --> 01:02:45.722
because he perceived that they
were about

01:02:45.724 --> 01:02:48.891
to come and take him by
force to make him king,

01:02:48.893 --> 01:02:51.351
and when he had sent the
multitudes away,

01:02:51.353 --> 01:02:54.229
he went up into a mountain apart
to pray.

01:02:54.231 --> 01:02:57.733
And when the evening was
come, he was there alone.

01:02:57.735 --> 01:03:00.403
But the ship was now in
the midst of the sea,

01:03:00.405 --> 01:03:03.655
tossed with waves, for
the wind was contrary.

01:03:03.657 --> 01:03:05.950
And in the fourth watch
of the night

01:03:05.952 --> 01:03:08.994
Jesus went unto them,
walking on the sea.

01:03:08.996 --> 01:03:12.123
And when the disciples saw
him walking on the sea,

01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:14.124
they were troubled, saying,

01:03:14.126 --> 01:03:17.461
it is a spirit, and
they cried out for fear.

01:03:17.463 --> 01:03:20.965
But straightway Jesus
spake unto them, saying,

01:03:20.967 --> 01:03:25.052
be of good cheer, it is I,
be not afraid.

01:03:25.054 --> 01:03:27.179
And Peter answered him and said,

01:03:27.181 --> 01:03:31.393
Lord, if it be thou, bid me
come unto thee on the water.

01:03:32.269 --> 01:03:33.978
And he said, come.

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:36.898
And when Peter was come
down out of the ship,

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:40.068
he walked on the water,
to go to Jesus.

01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:43.905
But when he saw the wind
boisterous, he was afraid,

01:03:43.907 --> 01:03:47.950
and beginning to sink, he
cried, saying, Lord, save me.

01:03:47.952 --> 01:03:51.079
And immediately Jesus
stretched forth his hand

01:03:51.081 --> 01:03:53.623
and caught him,
and said unto him,

01:03:53.625 --> 01:03:57.793
oh thou of little faith,
wherefore didst thou doubt?

01:03:57.795 --> 01:04:01.171
And when they were come into
the ship, the wind ceased.

01:04:01.173 --> 01:04:04.133
Then they that were in the
ship came and worshiped him,

01:04:04.135 --> 01:04:07.135
saying, of a truth thou
art the Son of God.

01:04:07.137 --> 01:04:09.054
And when they were gone over,

01:04:09.056 --> 01:04:11.599
they came into the
land of Gennesaret.

01:04:11.601 --> 01:04:14.226
And when the men of that
place had knowledge of him,

01:04:14.228 --> 01:04:17.271
they sent out into all
that country round about

01:04:17.273 --> 01:04:20.273
and brought unto him
all that were diseased,

01:04:20.275 --> 01:04:22.193
and besought him that
they might only

01:04:22.195 --> 01:04:24.403
touch the hem of his garment,

01:04:24.405 --> 01:04:27.824
and as many as touched
were made perfectly whole.

01:04:27.826 --> 01:04:29.825
I know what happens next.

01:04:29.827 --> 01:04:31.119
Tell us, Sarah.

01:04:31.121 --> 01:04:33.662
The day following, when
the people which stood

01:04:33.664 --> 01:04:35.248
on the other side of the sea

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.958
saw that there was none other
boat there,

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:41.003
save that one whereinto
his disciples were entered,

01:04:41.005 --> 01:04:45.133
and that Jesus went not with
his disciples into the boat,

01:04:45.135 --> 01:04:48.135
but that his disciples
were gone away alone,

01:04:48.137 --> 01:04:52.014
When the people therefore
saw that Jesus was not there,

01:04:52.016 --> 01:04:55.726
neither his disciples,
they also took shipping,

01:04:55.728 --> 01:04:59.021
and came to Capernaum,
seeking for Jesus.

01:04:59.023 --> 01:05:02.983
And when they had found him
on the other side of the sea,

01:05:02.985 --> 01:05:06.947
they said unto him, Rabbi,
when camest thou hither?

01:05:08.157 --> 01:05:10.532
Jesus answered them and said,

01:05:10.534 --> 01:05:13.619
verily, verily, I say unto you,

01:05:13.621 --> 01:05:17.789
ye seek me, not because
ye saw the miracles,

01:05:17.791 --> 01:05:21.961
but because ye did eat of
the loaves, and were filled.

01:05:21.963 --> 01:05:25.130
Labor not for the
meat which perisheth,

01:05:25.132 --> 01:05:29.010
but for that meat which
endureth unto everlasting life,

01:05:29.012 --> 01:05:32.472
which the Son of man shall give
unto you,

01:05:32.474 --> 01:05:36.099
for him hath
God the Father sealed.

01:05:36.101 --> 01:05:39.644
Then said they unto him,
what shall we do

01:05:39.646 --> 01:05:43.148
that we might work the
works of God?

01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:45.860
Jesus answered and said
unto them,

01:05:45.862 --> 01:05:48.237
this is the work of God,

01:05:48.239 --> 01:05:51.865
that ye believe on him whom he
hath sent.

01:05:51.867 --> 01:05:54.034
They said therefore unto him,

01:05:54.036 --> 01:05:56.412
what sign shewest thou then,

01:05:56.414 --> 01:05:59.167
that we may see,
and believe thee?

01:06:00.251 --> 01:06:02.168
What dost thou work?

01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:06.171
Our fathers did eat manna in
the desert, as it is written,

01:06:06.173 --> 01:06:09.175
he gave them bread
from heaven to eat.

01:06:09.177 --> 01:06:14.097
Then Jesus said unto them,
verily, verily, I say unto you,

01:06:14.099 --> 01:06:17.974
Moses gave you not that bread
from heaven,

01:06:17.976 --> 01:06:22.063
but my Father giveth you
the true bread from heaven.

01:06:22.065 --> 01:06:26.025
For the bread of God is he
which cometh down from heaven,

01:06:26.027 --> 01:06:29.237
and giveth life unto the world.

01:06:29.239 --> 01:06:33.201
Then said they unto him, Lord,
evermore give us this bread.

01:06:34.952 --> 01:06:39.162
And Jesus said unto them,
I am the bread of life,

01:06:39.164 --> 01:06:43.126
he that cometh to me
shall never hunger,

01:06:43.128 --> 01:06:46.838
and he that believeth on
me shall never thirst.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:50.590
But I said unto you that
ye also have seen me,

01:06:50.592 --> 01:06:52.552
and believe not.

01:06:52.554 --> 01:06:56.347
All that the Father giveth
me shall come to me,

01:06:56.349 --> 01:07:00.562
and him that cometh to me
I will in no wise cast out.

01:07:01.771 --> 01:07:06.106
For I came down from heaven,
not to do mine own will,

01:07:06.108 --> 01:07:08.818
but the will of him
that sent me.

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:12.112
And this is the Father's
will which hath sent me,

01:07:12.114 --> 01:07:16.909
that of all which he hath
given me I should lose nothing,

01:07:16.911 --> 01:07:20.579
but should raise it up
again at the last day.

01:07:20.581 --> 01:07:23.499
And this is the will of him that
sent me,

01:07:23.501 --> 01:07:28.253
that every one which seeth
the Son and believeth on him,

01:07:28.255 --> 01:07:30.215
may have everlasting life,

01:07:31.342 --> 01:07:34.635
and I will raise him up at the
last day.

01:07:34.637 --> 01:07:37.304
The Jews then murmured
at him, because he said

01:07:37.306 --> 01:07:40.724
I am the bread which
came down from heaven.

01:07:40.726 --> 01:07:45.271
And they said, is not this
Jesus, the son of Joseph,

01:07:45.273 --> 01:07:48.273
whose father and mother we know?

01:07:48.275 --> 01:07:52.487
How is it then that he saith,
I came down from heaven?

01:07:52.489 --> 01:07:55.740
Jesus therefore answered
and said unto them,

01:07:55.742 --> 01:07:58.034
murmur not among yourselves.

01:07:58.036 --> 01:08:01.287
No man can come to me,
except the Father

01:08:01.289 --> 01:08:03.331
which hath sent me draw him,

01:08:03.333 --> 01:08:07.126
and I will raise him up at the
last day.

01:08:07.128 --> 01:08:09.211
It is written in the prophets,

01:08:09.213 --> 01:08:11.963
and they shall be all
taught of God.

01:08:11.965 --> 01:08:14.842
Every man therefore
that hath heard,

01:08:14.844 --> 01:08:18.929
and hath learned of the
Father, cometh unto me.

01:08:18.930 --> 01:08:22.099
Not that any man hath
seen the Father,

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:27.354
save he which is of God,
he hath seen the Father.

01:08:27.356 --> 01:08:29.982
Verily, verily, I say unto you,

01:08:29.984 --> 01:08:33.738
he that believeth on me
hath everlasting life.

01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:37.615
I am that bread of life.

01:08:37.617 --> 01:08:41.828
Your fathers did eat manna in
the wilderness, and are dead.

01:08:42.622 --> 01:08:45.790
This is the bread which
cometh down from heaven,

01:08:45.792 --> 01:08:49.751
that a man may eat thereof,
and not die.

01:08:49.752 --> 01:08:53.005
I am the living bread which
came down from heaven.

01:08:53.006 --> 01:08:57.175
If any man eat of this
bread, he shall live forever,

01:08:57.176 --> 01:09:00.513
and the bread that I
will give is my flesh,

01:09:00.515 --> 01:09:05.018
which I will give for
the life of the world.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:08.312
The Jews therefore strove
among themselves, saying,

01:09:08.314 --> 01:09:11.898
how can this man give us his
flesh to eat?

01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:16.528
Then Jesus said unto them,
verily, verily, I say unto you,

01:09:16.529 --> 01:09:20.032
except ye eat the flesh of the
Son of man,

01:09:20.033 --> 01:09:24.327
and drink his blood,
ye have no life in you.

01:09:24.328 --> 01:09:27.831
Whoso eateth my flesh,
and drinketh my blood,

01:09:27.832 --> 01:09:32.711
hath eternal life, and I will
raise him up at the last day.

01:09:32.712 --> 01:09:36.926
For my flesh is meat indeed,
and my blood is drink indeed.

01:09:37.969 --> 01:09:41.261
He that eateth my flesh,
and drinketh my blood

01:09:41.264 --> 01:09:44.514
dwelleth in me, and I in him.

01:09:44.515 --> 01:09:48.685
As the living Father hath sent
me, and I live by the Father,

01:09:48.688 --> 01:09:52.567
so he that eateth me,
even he shall live by me.

01:09:53.649 --> 01:09:57.486
This is that bread which
came down from heaven,

01:09:57.488 --> 01:10:00.781
not as your fathers did
eat manna, and are dead.

01:10:00.783 --> 01:10:04.787
He that eateth of this
bread shall live forever.

01:10:06.081 --> 01:10:08.539
These things said
he in the synagogue,

01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:10.625
as he taught in Capernaum.

01:10:10.627 --> 01:10:13.210
Many therefore of his disciples,

01:10:13.212 --> 01:10:15.129
when they had heard this, said,

01:10:15.131 --> 01:10:18.424
this is a hard saying,
who can hear it?

01:10:18.426 --> 01:10:21.468
When Jesus knew in
himself that his disciples

01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:26.473
murmured at it, he said unto
them, doth this offend you?

01:10:26.475 --> 01:10:29.184
What and if ye shall see
the Son of man

01:10:29.186 --> 01:10:31.603
ascend up where he was before?

01:10:31.605 --> 01:10:33.981
It is the spirit
that quickeneth,

01:10:33.983 --> 01:10:36.526
the flesh profiteth nothing.

01:10:36.528 --> 01:10:38.986
The words that I speak unto you,

01:10:38.988 --> 01:10:42.072
they are spirit,
and they are life.

01:10:42.074 --> 01:10:45.201
But there are some of
you that believe not.

01:10:45.203 --> 01:10:47.495
For Jesus knew
from the beginning

01:10:47.497 --> 01:10:52.165
who they were that believed
not, and who should betray him.

01:10:52.167 --> 01:10:55.419
And he said, therefore said I
unto you

01:10:55.421 --> 01:10:57.754
that no man can come unto me,

01:10:57.756 --> 01:11:01.467
except it were given
unto him of my Father.

01:11:01.469 --> 01:11:04.469
From that time many of
his disciples went back,

01:11:04.471 --> 01:11:06.888
and walked no more with him.

01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:11.103
Then said Jesus unto the
12, will ye also go away?

01:11:11.938 --> 01:11:16.150
Then Simon Peter answered him,
Lord, to whom shall we go?

01:11:17.109 --> 01:11:20.111
Thou hast the words of
eternal life.

01:11:20.113 --> 01:11:23.990
And we believe and are sure
that thou art that Christ,

01:11:23.992 --> 01:11:26.241
the Son of the living God.

01:11:26.243 --> 01:11:30.037
Jesus answered them,
have not I chosen you 12,

01:11:30.039 --> 01:11:32.581
and one of you is a devil?

01:11:32.583 --> 01:11:36.210
He spake of Judas
Iscariot the son of Simon,

01:11:36.212 --> 01:11:40.964
for he it was that should
betray him, being one of the 12.

01:11:44.554 --> 01:11:47.138
Wow, guys,
that was so cool.

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.807
I never learned so much
about the Bible before.

01:11:49.809 --> 01:11:51.017
I know, right?

01:11:51.019 --> 01:11:53.143
Don't you love this place?

01:11:53.145 --> 01:11:54.644
Yeah, it's awesome.

01:11:54.646 --> 01:11:56.022
I just...

01:11:56.024 --> 01:11:57.482
What is it, Tammy?

01:11:57.484 --> 01:11:59.400
Well, I just wish we had
more time

01:11:59.402 --> 01:12:01.693
to listen to Sam
tell more stories.

01:12:01.695 --> 01:12:04.030
Well I can tell you another
Bible story

01:12:04.032 --> 01:12:05.615
if you like, Tammy.

01:12:05.617 --> 01:12:07.532
- Oh wow.
- Yeah!

01:12:07.534 --> 01:12:11.954
I'm gonna tell you the story
of the transfiguration.

01:12:11.956 --> 01:12:13.915
Oh ho ho, awesome!

01:12:13.917 --> 01:12:16.625
Let me see, oh yeah.

01:12:16.627 --> 01:12:18.878
This is how it goes.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:22.757
And after six days Jesus
taketh with him Peter,

01:12:22.759 --> 01:12:26.177
and James, and John,
and leadeth them up

01:12:26.179 --> 01:12:29.513
into an high mountain
apart from themselves.

01:12:29.515 --> 01:12:32.184
And was transfigured
before them,

01:12:33.103 --> 01:12:37.229
and his raiment became shining,
exceeding white as snow

01:12:37.231 --> 01:12:41.150
so as no fuller on earth can
white them.

01:12:41.152 --> 01:12:44.903
And there appeared unto
them Elias with Moses,

01:12:44.905 --> 01:12:47.906
and they were
talking with Jesus.

01:12:47.908 --> 01:12:51.244
And Peter answered
and said to Jesus,

01:12:51.246 --> 01:12:54.664
Master, it is good for us
to be here,

01:12:54.666 --> 01:12:57.583
and let us make
three tabernacles.

01:12:57.585 --> 01:13:02.004
One for thee, and one for
Moses, and one for Elias.

01:13:02.006 --> 01:13:06.219
For he wist not what to say,
for they were sore afraid.

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:10.470
And there was a cloud
that overshadowed them,

01:13:10.472 --> 01:13:14.099
and a voice came out of the
cloud, saying,

01:13:14.101 --> 01:13:16.770
this is my beloved Son,
hear him.

01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:21.523
And suddenly, when they
had looked round about,

01:13:21.525 --> 01:13:26.486
they saw no man any more, save
Jesus only with themselves.

01:13:26.488 --> 01:13:28.947
And as they came down
from the mountain,

01:13:28.949 --> 01:13:31.659
he charged them that
they should tell no man

01:13:31.661 --> 01:13:34.454
what things they had
seen, till the Son of man

01:13:34.456 --> 01:13:36.414
were risen from the dead.

01:13:36.416 --> 01:13:39.459
And they kept that saying
with themselves,

01:13:39.461 --> 01:13:41.294
questioning one with another

01:13:41.296 --> 01:13:44.254
what the rising from the dead
should mean.

01:13:44.256 --> 01:13:46.674
And when he came
to his disciples,

01:13:46.676 --> 01:13:49.634
he saw a great multitude
about them,

01:13:49.636 --> 01:13:52.597
and the scribes
questioning with them.

01:13:52.599 --> 01:13:56.308
And straightway all the
people, when they beheld him,

01:13:56.310 --> 01:14:00.562
were greatly amazed, and
running to him saluted him.

01:14:00.564 --> 01:14:05.401
And he asked the scribes,
what question ye with them?

01:14:05.403 --> 01:14:08.278
And one of the multitude
answered and said,

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:11.491
Master, I have brought unto thee
my son,

01:14:11.493 --> 01:14:13.826
which hath a dumb spirit.

01:14:13.828 --> 01:14:17.162
And wheresoever he taketh
him, he teareth him,

01:14:17.164 --> 01:14:20.540
and he foameth, and
gnasheth with his teeth,

01:14:20.542 --> 01:14:24.169
and pineth away, and I
spake to thy disciples

01:14:24.171 --> 01:14:28.590
that they should cast him
out, and they could not.

01:14:28.592 --> 01:14:32.928
He answered him and saith,
oh faithless generation,

01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:35.555
how long shall I be with you?

01:14:35.557 --> 01:14:38.308
How long shall I suffer you?

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:40.061
Bring him unto me.

01:14:40.063 --> 01:14:43.772
And they brought him unto
him, and when he saw him,

01:14:43.774 --> 01:14:46.067
straightway the spirit tare him,

01:14:46.069 --> 01:14:50.405
and he fell on the ground
and wallowed foaming.

01:14:50.407 --> 01:14:52.197
And he asked his father,

01:14:52.199 --> 01:14:55.410
how long is it ago since
this came unto him?

01:14:55.412 --> 01:14:57.620
And he said, of a child.

01:14:57.622 --> 01:15:01.749
And ofttimes it hath
cast him into the fire,

01:15:01.751 --> 01:15:04.669
and into the waters,
to destroy him,

01:15:04.671 --> 01:15:07.004
but if thou canst do any thing,

01:15:07.006 --> 01:15:10.633
have compassion on us,
and help us.

01:15:10.635 --> 01:15:14.178
Jesus said unto him, if thou
canst believe

01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:18.473
all things are possible
to him that believeth.

01:15:18.475 --> 01:15:22.269
And straightway the father
of the child cried out,

01:15:22.271 --> 01:15:25.690
and said with tears,
Lord, I believe,

01:15:25.692 --> 01:15:27.694
help thou mine unbelief.

01:15:28.819 --> 01:15:32.655
When Jesus saw that the
people came running together,

01:15:32.657 --> 01:15:36.034
he rebuked the foul
spirit, saying unto him,

01:15:36.036 --> 01:15:39.120
thou dumb and deaf spirit, I
charge thee,

01:15:39.122 --> 01:15:42.749
come out of him, and
enter no more into him.

01:15:42.751 --> 01:15:45.710
And the spirit cried, and rent
him sore,

01:15:45.712 --> 01:15:50.048
and came out of him,
and he was as one dead

01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:53.759
insomuch that many said,
he is dead.

01:15:53.761 --> 01:15:58.180
But Jesus took him by the
hand and lifted him up,

01:15:58.182 --> 01:16:00.016
and he arose.

01:16:00.018 --> 01:16:02.684
And when he was come
into the house,

01:16:02.686 --> 01:16:05.187
his disciples asked
him privately,

01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:07.567
why could not we cast him out?

01:16:08.609 --> 01:16:12.778
And he said unto them, this
kind can come forth by nothing

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:15.656
but by prayer and fasting.

01:16:15.658 --> 01:16:19.451
And they departed thence,
and passed through Galilee

01:16:19.453 --> 01:16:22.914
and he would not that
any man should know it.

01:16:22.916 --> 01:16:26.750
For he taught his disciples
and said unto them,

01:16:26.752 --> 01:16:30.671
the Son of man is delivered
into the hands of men,

01:16:30.673 --> 01:16:32.964
and they shall kill him.

01:16:32.966 --> 01:16:37.803
And after that he is killed,
he shall rise the third day.

01:16:37.805 --> 01:16:40.723
But they understood
not that saying,

01:16:40.725 --> 01:16:43.393
and were afraid to ask him.

01:16:43.395 --> 01:16:46.228
And what
happens after that, Sarah?

01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:49.440
- Well...
- Oh I know, I know!

01:16:49.442 --> 01:16:50.775
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:16:50.777 --> 01:16:52.110
I know the next story.

01:16:52.112 --> 01:16:53.402
How do you know?

01:16:53.404 --> 01:16:56.030
I learned it in Bible
Town last time I visited.

01:16:56.032 --> 01:16:59.784
It's about Christ teaching
humility and forgiveness.

01:16:59.786 --> 01:17:03.412
At the same time came the
disciples unto Jesus, saying,

01:17:03.414 --> 01:17:05.915
who is the greatest in
the kingdom of heaven?

01:17:05.917 --> 01:17:08.835
And Jesus called a little child
unto him

01:17:08.837 --> 01:17:10.503
and set him in the
midst of them,

01:17:10.505 --> 01:17:12.796
and said, verily I say unto you,

01:17:12.798 --> 01:17:16.342
except ye be converted and
become as little children,

01:17:16.344 --> 01:17:18.803
ye shall not enter into
the kingdom of heaven.

01:17:18.805 --> 01:17:21.388
Whosoever therefore
shall humble himself

01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:24.142
as this little child, the same
is greatest

01:17:24.144 --> 01:17:25.852
in the kingdom of heaven.

01:17:25.854 --> 01:17:27.937
And whoso shall receive
one such little child

01:17:27.939 --> 01:17:29.856
in my name receiveth me.

01:17:29.858 --> 01:17:32.442
But whoso shall offend
one of these little ones

01:17:32.444 --> 01:17:34.902
which believe in me,
it were better for him

01:17:34.904 --> 01:17:37.362
that a millstone were
hanged about his neck,

01:17:37.364 --> 01:17:39.866
and that he were drowned
in the depth of the sea.

01:17:39.868 --> 01:17:42.951
Take heed that ye despise
not one of these little ones,

01:17:42.953 --> 01:17:45.871
for I say unto you that
in heaven their angels

01:17:45.873 --> 01:17:49.541
do always behold the face of
my Father which is in heaven.

01:17:49.543 --> 01:17:53.254
For the Son of man is come
to save that which was lost.

01:17:53.256 --> 01:17:54.296
How think ye?

01:17:54.298 --> 01:17:55.839
If a man have an hundred sheep

01:17:55.841 --> 01:17:57.174
and one of them be gone astray,

01:17:57.176 --> 01:17:59.218
doth he not leave the
ninety and nine,

01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:00.510
and goeth into the mountains,

01:18:00.512 --> 01:18:02.638
and seeketh that
which is gone astray?

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:05.933
And if so be that he find
it, verily I say unto you,

01:18:05.935 --> 01:18:07.934
he rejoiceth more of that sheep,

01:18:07.936 --> 01:18:11.229
than of the ninety and
nine which went not astray.

01:18:11.231 --> 01:18:13.607
Even so it is not the will of
your Father

01:18:13.609 --> 01:18:14.901
which is in heaven

01:18:14.903 --> 01:18:16.986
that one of these little
ones should perish.

01:18:16.988 --> 01:18:19.530
Moreover if thy brother
shall trespass against thee,

01:18:19.532 --> 01:18:23.034
go and tell him his fault
between thee and him alone.

01:18:23.036 --> 01:18:26.912
If he shall hear thee, thou
hast gained thy brother.

01:18:26.914 --> 01:18:29.749
But if he will not hear
thee, then take with thee

01:18:29.751 --> 01:18:33.085
one or two more, that in the
mouth of two or three witnesses

01:18:33.087 --> 01:18:35.463
every word may be established.

01:18:35.465 --> 01:18:37.882
And if he shall
neglect to hear them,

01:18:37.884 --> 01:18:39.884
tell it unto the church,

01:18:39.886 --> 01:18:41.803
but if he neglect to
hear the church,

01:18:41.805 --> 01:18:45.180
let him be unto thee as an
heathen man and a publican.

01:18:45.182 --> 01:18:48.934
Verily I say unto you, whatsoever
ye shall bind on earth

01:18:48.936 --> 01:18:50.812
shall be bound in heaven,

01:18:50.814 --> 01:18:52.854
and whatsoever ye shall
loose on earth

01:18:52.856 --> 01:18:54.816
shall be loosed in heaven.

01:18:54.818 --> 01:18:58.027
Again I say unto you that if
two of you shall agree on earth

01:18:58.029 --> 01:19:00.862
as touching any thing that they
shall ask,

01:19:00.864 --> 01:19:04.409
it shall be done for them of
my Father which is in heaven.

01:19:04.411 --> 01:19:07.995
For where two or three are
gathered together in my name,

01:19:07.997 --> 01:19:10.455
there am I in the midst of them.

01:19:10.457 --> 01:19:12.834
Then came Peter to him,
and said,

01:19:12.836 --> 01:19:15.003
Lord, how oft shall my
brother sin against me

01:19:15.005 --> 01:19:16.169
and I forgive him?

01:19:16.171 --> 01:19:17.629
Till seven times?

01:19:17.631 --> 01:19:21.800
Jesus saith unto him, I say
not unto thee till seven times,

01:19:21.802 --> 01:19:24.137
but until 70 times seven.

01:19:24.139 --> 01:19:27.014
Therefore is the kingdom of
heaven likened

01:19:27.016 --> 01:19:28.266
unto a certain king,

01:19:28.268 --> 01:19:30.893
which would take account
of his servants.

01:19:30.895 --> 01:19:32.644
And when he had begun to reckon,

01:19:32.646 --> 01:19:36.441
one was brought unto him
which owed him 10,000 talents.

01:19:36.443 --> 01:19:38.942
But forasmuch as he had
not to pay,

01:19:38.944 --> 01:19:41.528
his lord commanded him
to be sold,

01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:45.241
and his wife, and children,
and all that he had,

01:19:45.243 --> 01:19:47.076
and payment to be made.

01:19:47.078 --> 01:19:49.995
The servant therefore fell
down and worshiped him,

01:19:49.997 --> 01:19:52.498
saying, Lord, have patience
with me,

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.334
and I will pay thee all.

01:19:54.336 --> 01:19:57.961
Then the lord of that servant
was moved with compassion,

01:19:57.963 --> 01:20:00.882
and loosed him,
and forgave him the debt.

01:20:00.884 --> 01:20:02.759
But the same servant went out

01:20:02.761 --> 01:20:04.802
and found one of his
fellow servants

01:20:04.804 --> 01:20:06.763
which owed him an hundred pence

01:20:06.765 --> 01:20:09.223
and he laid hands on him,
and took him by the throat,

01:20:09.225 --> 01:20:11.642
saying, pay me that thou owest.

01:20:11.644 --> 01:20:13.811
And his fellow servant
fell down at his feet

01:20:13.813 --> 01:20:15.146
and besought him, saying,

01:20:15.148 --> 01:20:18.232
have patience with me,
and I will pay thee all.

01:20:18.234 --> 01:20:22.027
And he would not, but went
and cast him into prison

01:20:22.029 --> 01:20:24.030
till he should pay the debt.

01:20:24.032 --> 01:20:26.866
So when his fellow
servants saw what was done,

01:20:26.868 --> 01:20:30.035
they were very sorry, and
came and told unto their lord

01:20:30.037 --> 01:20:31.286
all that was done.

01:20:31.288 --> 01:20:35.124
Then his lord, after that he
had called him, said unto him,

01:20:35.126 --> 01:20:39.294
oh thou wicked servant, I
forgave thee all that debt

01:20:39.296 --> 01:20:41.421
because thou desiredst me.

01:20:41.423 --> 01:20:44.092
Shouldest not thou also
have had compassion

01:20:44.094 --> 01:20:47.844
on thy fellow servant,
even as I had pity on thee?

01:20:47.846 --> 01:20:51.223
And his lord was wroth, and
delivered him to the tormentors

01:20:51.225 --> 01:20:53.934
till he should pay all
that was due unto him.

01:20:53.936 --> 01:20:57.562
So likewise shall my heavenly
Father do also unto you,

01:20:57.564 --> 01:20:59.607
if ye from your hearts
forgive not

01:20:59.609 --> 01:21:02.610
every one his brother
their trespasses.

01:21:02.612 --> 01:21:05.987
And he turned him unto his
disciples and said privately,

01:21:05.989 --> 01:21:09.866
blessed are the eyes which
see the things that ye see,

01:21:09.868 --> 01:21:13.036
for I tell you that
many prophets and kings

01:21:13.038 --> 01:21:16.124
have desired to see
those things which ye see

01:21:16.126 --> 01:21:17.750
and have not seen them,

01:21:17.752 --> 01:21:19.835
and to hear those things
which ye hear

01:21:19.837 --> 01:21:21.294
and have not heard them.

01:21:21.296 --> 01:21:23.589
- Incredible.
- Great job, Jimmy!

01:21:23.591 --> 01:21:25.049
Thanks.

01:21:25.051 --> 01:21:26.299
Wow, amazing.

01:21:26.301 --> 01:21:28.678
You guys, I'm so happy
I came along.

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.722
This was one of the
coolest days ever.

01:21:30.724 --> 01:21:32.932
I had an awesome day too!

01:21:32.934 --> 01:21:34.892
Time to get back home, guys.

01:21:34.894 --> 01:21:36.518
Let's say goodbye to Bible Town.

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.146
Goodbye Bible Town.

01:21:38.148 --> 01:21:39.772
Until next time.

01:21:39.774 --> 01:21:41.857
When are we going back?

01:21:41.859 --> 01:21:44.317
Yeah, I wanna go back too.

01:21:44.319 --> 01:21:47.030
What about we go back
tomorrow, after school?

01:21:47.032 --> 01:21:48.071
Tots!

01:21:48.073 --> 01:21:50.950
You guys can count me in.

01:21:50.952 --> 01:21:52.994
Me too, can't wait!

01:21:52.996 --> 01:21:55.120
All right, let's make tomorrow

01:21:55.122 --> 01:21:57.581
another Bible Town
adventure day!

01:21:57.583 --> 01:21:59.168
- Awesome!
- Woo hoo!

01:22:03.008 --> 01:22:08.008
