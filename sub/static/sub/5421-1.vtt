And yet still resenting
the fact that...

00:53.354 --> 00:55.589
your childhood was taken.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.858
It all started on the corner.

00:57.891 --> 01:01.462
Egos on the line
as tensions rose high.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.864
Two points in the hoop,
and some debts weren't paid.

01:03.897 --> 01:07.568
And all of a sudden,
punches started to fly.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.804
Well, you decided to keep
your rival's personal stash.

01:10.838 --> 01:14.642
While all of y'all decided to
steam some of them green things,

01:17.511 --> 01:21.415
See, your determination
superseded your high education,

01:21.449 --> 01:24.185
and, instead,
you became a street scholar.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.687
You bled, broke bread,

01:26.720 --> 01:29.223
'cause you knew
the other three would follow.

03:08.589 --> 03:11.892
that only reveals itself
in moments like these.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.495

03:17.030 --> 03:20.301
E-Bone, Money and me...

have been through this
too many times to count.

03:23.604 --> 03:26.874

someone was missing.

We were in one of the worst

06:39.667 --> 06:42.736
had hung together
since the second grade.

06:42.770 --> 06:46.874
We waged a war at Marshall
every day that summer.

06:46.907 --> 06:50.611
We were called out by Lathan
and his crew this one day.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.680
Lathan Butler was
a 17-year-old kid...

06:52.713 --> 06:55.983
who swore up and down he
was comin' up in the world.

06:56.016 --> 07:00.454
They thought playin' us would be easy
money since we were younger than them.

07:00.488 --> 07:03.791
We played because 20 bucks is hard
to come by when you're a teenager.

07:03.824 --> 07:08.095
Besides, I think we had
somethin' to prove.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.798

We called him Wren.

08:48.862 --> 08:52.800
He worked for Benjamin J.
Bateman, A.K.A. Benny.

08:52.833 --> 08:56.604
Benny had absolutely no moral
convictions on how he made money.

08:56.637 --> 09:00.941
More than prostitution, extortion or
drugs... which he was definitely into...

09:00.974 --> 09:03.152

contributing to the delinquency...

09:03.176 --> 09:06.213

in the neighborhood.

- Fourteen.

they owe you, little man?

09:40.113 --> 09:43.216

09:43.250 --> 09:45.653

09:51.925 --> 09:54.303

Shut up, man.

- Smoke it. Sniff it.

He said we had heart.

That was bomb-ass shit to say.
E-Bone's Uncle Pee Wee...

13:22.335 --> 13:26.006

13:26.039 --> 13:29.977

clothes, can't keep a job...

in the teachers' lounge.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.990
If you wanted weed, you
could go just about anywhere.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.058
I mean, there were plenty
of dealers out there...

15:25.092 --> 15:27.127
who would sell you
a nickel or a dime bag...

15:27.160 --> 15:30.563
of just about whatever it was
you were into.

15:30.597 --> 15:35.035
But for variety
and that really good stuff...

15:35.068 --> 15:38.571
and for the dealer who never
ran out of your favorite stash,

15:38.605 --> 15:41.041
you had to go to Sam's place.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.076
Yo, who's winning?

15:43.110 --> 15:45.245
Sox. Last inning.
Rice just doubled.

15:45.278 --> 15:49.582
Damn. Pee Wee must be feelin' pretty
good let you come out after dark.

15:49.616 --> 15:54.087
Usual? Nah. He want four Thai
sticks and two ounces of the Buddha.

15:54.121 --> 15:56.121
All right. You wait right here.
I'll be right back.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.693
And look, don't none of you little
motherfuckers touch my food,

16:00.727 --> 16:03.596
especially you,
you little fat fucker.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.066
Hey, fuck you.
Who the fuck is he callin' fat?

16:06.099 --> 16:08.101
- Your fat ass.
- Fuck you.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.210
What the fuck you...

16:17.244 --> 16:21.181
Hey! What the fuck?
What's wrong with you?

16:21.214 --> 16:24.117
- Come on, guys. Let's go.
- You ain't gonna pay?

16:24.151 --> 16:26.519
Man, sometimes you get on
my motherfuckin' nerve.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.664
- How we gonna get outta here?
- They're blockin' the door.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.024
- Let's go out the back door.
- Goddamn!

16:31.058 --> 16:33.293
Go! Go!
Get outta my house!

16:33.326 --> 16:35.395
Take this shit outside!
What's wrong with you?

16:39.199 --> 16:41.434
Come on, E-Bone!
We gotta get goin'!

16:41.468 --> 16:43.670
Come on, man! We gotta go!
We gotta go!

16:43.703 --> 16:45.438
Go, go, go!
Go, go!

16:54.281 --> 16:56.316
Hey, man, anybody comin'?

16:56.349 --> 16:59.319
They prob... They probably
don't even know we left yet.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.521
How much shit did you get?
Man, I don't know.

17:02.722 --> 17:06.126
Damn! We gonna get higher
than a motherfucker!

17:06.159 --> 17:08.060
Hell, yeah!

17:09.529 --> 17:11.531
What you trippin' on, Tris?

17:14.201 --> 17:16.636
What if we didn't
smoke all of it?

17:16.669 --> 17:19.106
I know you ain't talkin'
about sellin' it.

17:19.138 --> 17:22.275
Why not?
But where, man?

17:22.309 --> 17:25.145
Lathan and them got it locked down
from Gold Fall to Four Corners.

17:25.178 --> 17:28.448
In case y'all don't remember, that was
Benny up in that Cadillac this afternoon.

17:28.481 --> 17:31.151
And I ain't tryin'
to fuck with Benny, man.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.486
Who said anything about
sellin' it on the streets?

17:33.520 --> 17:35.788
We can sell it at school.

17:35.822 --> 17:39.726
All you got is a few burnouts
selling nickel bags to they friends.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.828
We'd be the only crew.

17:41.861 --> 17:44.364
We could supply the burnouts
and take they customers.

17:46.433 --> 17:50.237
And that ain't even the beautiful thing.
What's the beautiful thing?

17:50.270 --> 17:53.506
We don't have to worry
about gettin' caught...

17:53.540 --> 17:55.775
'cause we gonna be
supplyin' the teachers.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.877
Ain't no teachers gonna
buy no herb, Tris.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.114
Shit, man. We just saw
Mr. Thomas buy from Sam today.

18:01.148 --> 18:04.384
Damn motherfuckin'
skippy. Shit.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.686
I'm with you, Tris.
E.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.389
Me too.
Let's do it.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.559
Let's do this.
Let's go.

18:15.362 --> 18:18.265
When we ran out of the stash
we ripped off from Sam,

18:18.298 --> 18:20.433
we started buying from him
to supply our customers.

18:20.467 --> 18:24.504
Pee Wee squared it with Sam
about us stealin' from him,

18:24.537 --> 18:26.906
so we let him get high
as much as he wants.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.642
We were buying so much shit,
it didn't matter to us.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.881
At first, we thought
the money was pretty good,

18:34.914 --> 18:37.217
but we had to kick
so much of it back to Sam...

18:37.250 --> 18:40.920
that we realized
he was the one gettin' paid.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.523
That's when I decided
to grow our own shit,

18:43.556 --> 18:46.693
and then the paper
came in nonstop.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.329
E-Bone got pretty good
at growin' that shit too.

18:49.362 --> 18:52.232
Twinkie helped us out by
lettin' us use the back room...

18:52.265 --> 18:54.634
in one of his girls' apartments.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.304
We kicked back a couple hundred
to her every once in a while...

18:57.337 --> 18:59.806
for lettin' us keep the place.

18:59.839 --> 19:03.743
She appreciated that
and let us know.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.612
We couldn't believe
the life we were livin'.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.652
Where you goin' E-Bone?
Where you goin', boy?

19:12.685 --> 19:14.821
That's some dope new gear
you sportin', E-Bone.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.427
- Get up, girl.
- What the fuck y'all want?

19:20.460 --> 19:22.895
You ain't so tough without your
crew, you little punk?

19:22.929 --> 19:25.698
I told Tristan I was comin'
back for my shit, didn't I?

19:25.732 --> 19:28.132
I guess I'm just gonna have to
take it out your ass, ain't I?

19:40.847 --> 19:43.250
We bombin' on all you
punk-ass bitches!

19:43.283 --> 19:44.917
This is our motherfuckin' block!

19:57.597 --> 20:00.500
Hey, Uncle Rob.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.603
Hey, little Mack.
How you doin'?

20:03.636 --> 20:06.506
Good. Pretty good.
Hey. The place...

20:06.539 --> 20:08.908
The place looks good.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.511
What this place
looks like is empty.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.513
It ain't caught on the
way I thought it would.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.254
Boy, what are you doin'?

20:21.288 --> 20:23.290
It's the first of the month.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.992
Look, the rent on this place
ain't gonna pay itself.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.395
The money don't know where it comes
from, so just take it.

20:28.428 --> 20:31.798
Boy, if your daddy knew what you was
doin', he'd kill you.

20:31.831 --> 20:35.435
And if he knew I was taking money from you
to run this place, I'd be just as dead.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.670
But he doesn't know, and,
as long as he lives,

20:37.704 --> 20:40.840
he doesn't ever need
to know about this, right?

20:45.011 --> 20:47.947
Right.
The barbershop's gonna pick up.

20:47.980 --> 20:52.685
I know it will. I mean,
I believe in you, Uncle Rob.

20:52.719 --> 20:55.000
What good is makin' money if
you can't do nothin' with it?

20:57.890 --> 21:00.793
You know, boy, sometimes I think
you the grown-up and I'm the child.

21:00.827 --> 21:04.531
Now, we gotta get on home
before Mama's dinner gets cold.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.635
Hey, Tristan, hold up.
There's somethin'...

21:08.668 --> 21:10.970
I been wantin' to talk to you
about for a long while now.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.340
I really gotta go, Uncle...
Don't you interrupt me.

21:13.373 --> 21:16.543
Now, if you gonna
be in this game...

21:16.576 --> 21:19.788
And from the looks of things, it looks like
you done made up your mind about that...

21:19.812 --> 21:23.383
You got to realize
that this is a losin' game.

21:23.416 --> 21:26.886
Drug dealers don't have pensions,
they don't end up with retirement funds...

21:26.919 --> 21:29.088
and they don't end up with
the big house on the hill.

21:29.121 --> 21:32.659
They end up dead or
wishin' that they were.

21:32.692 --> 21:36.429
So, what's your point, Unc?
Make a plan. That's the point.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.466
Do somethin' with your money.

21:39.499 --> 21:42.902
Set yourself up to get out of
this game when the time is right.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.037
I'm talkin' about investments...

21:45.071 --> 21:47.374
Legitimate investments.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.576
Now, I'm gonna take this
money as an investment.

21:49.609 --> 21:53.012
You investin' in my barbershop.

21:53.045 --> 21:56.383
I'm gonna teach you the ins
and outs of this business.

21:56.416 --> 21:59.786
From now on, we not just
relatives, we are partners.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.355
And we gonna make this
a success together.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.092
Partners.
Partners.

22:09.496 --> 22:12.632
All right. You tell your mama
I'm gonna be a little late.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.501
All right.
Y'all go on and eat without me.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.903
All right.

22:16.936 --> 22:20.039
Baby, you haven't eaten
your mashed potatoes.

22:20.072 --> 22:22.141
I don't like them.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.544
But they'll make you
big and strong.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.946
You've been saying that
for years, Mom.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.749
What do you know about
"years," little girl?

22:29.782 --> 22:32.519
You only eight.
Yeah, but I'm an old soul.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.590
"Old soul."

22:37.624 --> 22:38.991
How's everything
with you, Tristan?

22:39.025 --> 22:41.628
Good, Pops.
Honey?

22:41.661 --> 22:45.465
Have you told Tristan
you saw his report card?

22:45.498 --> 22:49.469
No, I didn't.
Straight A's again?

22:49.502 --> 22:52.539
You keep this up, we gonna
have to send you to Harvard.

22:52.572 --> 22:55.107
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it. You help your mother.

22:58.778 --> 23:01.448
Tristan.
Simon and Marlon are here.

23:03.950 --> 23:07.053
Wass... Wassup, man? What y'all doin' here?
You... You want some chicken?

23:09.656 --> 23:13.059
- We got a problem, man.
- What's up?

23:13.092 --> 23:15.628
It's E-Bone.

23:26.706 --> 23:30.843
Tristan, Simon, Money.
Broke-ass Pee Wee.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.912
Someone try to break
your legs too?

23:32.945 --> 23:35.047
Took you guys long enough to get here.
Shut your ass.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.450
Can we see him?

23:37.484 --> 23:39.486
Come on in.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.962
- Hey. What up, fellas?
- What up, E?

23:49.996 --> 23:52.899
What's the deal, E?
How you feelin', killer?

23:52.932 --> 23:56.068
Come on, now.
Edward, I want you to finish this.

23:56.102 --> 23:59.572
Look, Nana, I need
to talk to my friends.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.709
I'm not going anywhere
until you finish eating.

24:02.742 --> 24:05.211
It's okay, Mrs. Winslett.
I'll make sure he eats it.

24:05.244 --> 24:08.715
I'll make sure he eats it all.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.584
- Is that all right with you, Edward?
- Yes, Nana.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.020
I'll be outside if you need me.

24:14.053 --> 24:16.623
Okay.

24:22.995 --> 24:25.932
Make sure he eats
all of it, Tristan.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.735
Yeah. Make sure he
gets it and not Simon.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.943
I ain't gonna feed ya.

24:36.976 --> 24:40.547
- So, do you feel as bad as you look?
- What took y'all so long?

24:40.580 --> 24:42.549
Yo, it was Lathan and them,
wasn't it?

24:42.582 --> 24:44.984
- Yeah.
- Yo, it don't make sense, E...

24:45.017 --> 24:47.754
Him fucking you up like this
over a couple of ounces?

24:47.787 --> 24:51.558
Three months ago?
It ain't makin' sense, E.

24:51.591 --> 24:53.626
Hey, what you
talkin' about, man?

24:53.660 --> 24:57.764
We straight embarrassed him,
in front of Benny too.

24:57.797 --> 25:00.232
I say you got lucky, E.

25:00.266 --> 25:02.802
He might have killed your ass.

25:02.835 --> 25:06.038
- Look, what happened, E-Bone?
- What you mean, "What happened?"

25:06.072 --> 25:08.007
I got fucked up.
That's what happened.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.544
Look, Money's right.

25:11.578 --> 25:14.089
Lathan wouldn't have came after
you like this over a couple ounces.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.115
- Yeah. Come on, E.
- Too much time has passed.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.885
So, what happened?

25:18.918 --> 25:21.287
Look, I was doin' business
on the street.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.322
You bullshittin'.

25:23.355 --> 25:27.059
- We said only at school.
- Man, I know what we said.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.937
But there's money on the street, kid.
I'm telling you.

25:28.961 --> 25:32.732
So, in other words, you almost
get killed for a few pennies.

25:32.765 --> 25:35.835
Man, is you stupid?
Pennies?

25:35.868 --> 25:38.270
Money, go over there and
bring me that jar of peanuts.

25:45.244 --> 25:47.246
Shit.

25:52.284 --> 25:54.286
Man, let me help you.

26:01.160 --> 26:05.998
Yeah, and this is only from
me working just three weeks.

26:06.032 --> 26:09.602
Man, imagine all of us working,
man, for months or even years.

26:09.636 --> 26:12.304
Just think of all the shit
we can get, Tris.

26:12.338 --> 26:15.174
Yo, what about Lathan?
We still gotta deal with him.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.677
Man, fuck Lathan, man.

26:19.712 --> 26:21.748
Look.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.983
Hey, where the fuck
you get that, man?

26:24.016 --> 26:27.820
Dennis and his brother Randy robbed a
gun store in Brockton a couple days ago.

26:27.854 --> 26:31.924
They got all kinds of steel.
We can get anything we want.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.762
Let's go, fellas.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.233
Get better, man.

26:43.135 --> 26:45.404
Hey, I want y'all
to know somethin'.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.174
I wasn't holdin' out on y'all.
I was gonna tell you.

26:50.309 --> 26:53.946
I just wanted to see what was out
there on the street, you know?

26:56.315 --> 26:58.885
Yeah, man. Yeah, man. We know.

26:58.918 --> 27:00.953
Get better.
Take care of that eye.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.889
Holler at you in a minute.

27:21.874 --> 27:24.711
- Hi, Tristan.
- Hey, wassup?

27:27.246 --> 27:30.082
Shit. You're not gonna speak?

27:30.116 --> 27:33.252
You talkin' to me?
I ain't talkin' to myself.

27:33.285 --> 27:36.355
I don't think I remember your name.
You gonna do me like that.

27:36.388 --> 27:40.827
You're cute and everything, and I know
you got this little mack thing goin' on,

27:40.860 --> 27:42.895
but I can't be messin'
with no drug dealers.

27:42.929 --> 27:45.231
I ain't no drug dealer.
Come on, Tristan. I'm not stupid.

27:45.264 --> 27:47.767
So you do remember my name.

27:47.800 --> 27:51.938
Okay, so maybe I do, but that
doesn't change the fact that you're...

27:54.140 --> 27:56.042
What's that?
Open it.

28:00.747 --> 28:03.449
It's beautiful.
It's yours.

28:03.482 --> 28:09.188
I can't take this. You have to.
It's nonrefundable.

28:09.221 --> 28:14.193
Listen, I hear you on this little drug-dealing
thing you're talkin' about, right?

28:14.226 --> 28:17.396
But I ain't no dealer. I just help
out my friends from time to time.

28:17.429 --> 28:20.299
That's all? That's all.
I promise.

28:22.101 --> 28:24.136
Thanks for the necklace.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.272
So can I walk you home?

28:26.305 --> 28:30.076
Okay.
You look beautiful with that.

28:30.109 --> 28:33.345
- You sure they in there?
- That's the word.

28:33.379 --> 28:36.315
Let's do this.

28:36.348 --> 28:40.486
I wasn't content with what
we had just dealin' at school.

28:41.988 --> 28:45.491
E-Bone kicked off
the inevitable.

28:45.524 --> 28:49.328
First rule of business...
Control the market.

28:49.361 --> 28:52.899
It was time to elevate the game.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.201
Shit. How many books
y'all get?

28:55.234 --> 28:58.237
Y'all count 'em up.
I gotta take a piss.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.808
Lathan be cheatin'.
When he comes back,

29:01.841 --> 29:03.943
I'm gonna put
a bullet in his ass.

29:03.976 --> 29:06.946
That's why I don't like playin' with
him, 'cause he always be cheatin'.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.480
♪♪

29:33.039 --> 29:37.143
Aw, shit! What the fuck
you goin' to do, bitch?

29:37.176 --> 29:40.179
Little Tristan?

29:40.212 --> 29:43.082
You better kill my ass
right now, motherfucker,

29:43.115 --> 29:45.351
if you got the balls, bitch.

29:48.187 --> 29:51.357
Mother...

29:51.390 --> 29:54.193
I read this book about
World War II one time.

29:54.226 --> 29:56.371
Damn. One of the soldiers said
that every time he killed someone,

29:56.395 --> 29:59.565
he saw the face
of the first man he murdered.

29:59.598 --> 30:02.101
It's like none of
the other faces register.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.837
You kept killin' the same guy
over and over again. Mama.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.078
Lathan was the first cat
I ever killed.

30:12.111 --> 30:14.613
The soldier was right.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.449
I killed other dudes,

30:17.483 --> 30:20.552
but, to this day,
I can only see Lathan's face,

30:20.586 --> 30:23.890
knowin'... Come on, Tris.
Let's go, man.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.958
Knowin' he was gonna die.

30:25.992 --> 30:29.228
Come on, man. Let's go.
In less than a second,

30:29.261 --> 30:31.864
what little bit of childhood
we had left was gone.

30:31.898 --> 30:35.134
I had made decisions about my life
based on my friendships with my boys,

30:35.167 --> 30:38.370
but, until that moment,
I could always walk away.

30:38.404 --> 30:41.540
Now there was no walkin' away.
Lathan!

30:41.573 --> 30:45.444
I was no longer a kid.
Now I was a gangster.

30:45.477 --> 30:49.015
We all were, and that's
the way we wanted it.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.083
Weed is
a pretty lightweight drug,

30:51.117 --> 30:53.352
even back then.

30:53.385 --> 30:57.656
In that game, you usually ain't got to
worry about no one tryin' to murder you.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.927
I killed Lathan because
he was becomin' a pain,

31:00.960 --> 31:04.030
and I knew I would feel
better once he was gone.

31:04.063 --> 31:07.934
Now everyone had no choice
but to take us seriously.

31:07.967 --> 31:10.269
But I had to keep
telling myself over and over,

31:10.302 --> 31:13.039
it was just business.

31:13.072 --> 31:16.342
I said it enough times that I
actually started to believe it.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.510
There wasn't any reason
to kill the rest of 'em.

31:18.544 --> 31:21.613
Without Lathan,
they were nothin'.

31:21.647 --> 31:24.450
And no one goes to the cops
in this neighborhood.

31:28.154 --> 31:30.389
Things were different now.

31:30.422 --> 31:33.125
We were ghetto superstars
before, but,

31:33.159 --> 31:36.228
after we took out Lathan
and took over all his customers,

31:37.329 --> 31:39.498
now we were ghetto legends.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.638
But there was one face...

31:46.672 --> 31:49.241
that didn't show a look
of admiration or respect.

Now make no mistake.

Brian Torrance and Archie Tyler.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.335
They were detectives
assigned to our case.

34:30.369 --> 34:33.205
See, after 12 years,
the local cops couldn't catch us,

34:33.239 --> 34:35.407
so the brass assigned
Abbott and Costello here...

34:35.440 --> 34:37.643
to make their presence known,

34:37.676 --> 34:40.879
thinkin' that, if the heat was
on, we'd slow down a little,

34:40.911 --> 34:43.382
maybe make a mistake
so they could catch us.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.817
As usual, they were wrong.

34:45.851 --> 34:49.655
How about it, Tris? Any idea why
somebody'd come in here, rob your uncle?

34:49.688 --> 34:52.424
No, man.

34:52.458 --> 34:56.495
- No idea whatsoever?
- That's what I just said.

34:56.527 --> 34:58.764
Well, why is it that I
don't believe you?

35:00.766 --> 35:03.702
I don't know.

35:03.735 --> 35:06.772
Maybe you just a naturally
suspicious kinda guy.

35:06.805 --> 35:09.241
Let me ask you a question.

35:09.275 --> 35:12.478
Why would they send two vice
detectives to investigate a robbery?

35:12.511 --> 35:15.214
Fourteen-Paul...
Drug-related theft.

35:17.849 --> 35:20.286
And what makes you think
it's drug-related?

35:20.319 --> 35:22.354
I don't know.

35:22.388 --> 35:25.591
Maybe because the owner
is a drug dealer.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.827
Whatever, man.
So, what happened, Tris?

35:28.860 --> 35:31.430
One of your little crackhead
buddies get all mad at ya?

35:31.463 --> 35:36.502
If you two
wasn't so damn pathetic,

35:36.535 --> 35:38.837
you'd almost be funny.

35:38.870 --> 35:41.773
But instead, you're nothin'.

35:43.209 --> 35:45.544
I'm nothin'?

35:45.577 --> 35:47.913
You got no idea
how close we are, fucko!

35:47.946 --> 35:50.449
You and your little crew
are done.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.894
I guess that means you won't be searchin'
too hard for the guy that robbed us.

35:52.918 --> 35:55.454
Now, will you?
Hey, Tris.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.523
If I was you,

35:57.556 --> 35:59.825
the shop would be the last
thing I'd be worried about.

35:59.858 --> 36:03.329
You better start growin' yourself
some eyes in the back of your head.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.610
What the fuck
were they doin' in here?

36:18.644 --> 36:20.812
Hey, I didn't call them.
They just showed up.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.881
Kinda like fungus.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.950
It ain't funny, Unc.

36:24.983 --> 36:27.219
Torrance and Tyler have it in for me.
You know that.

36:27.253 --> 36:28.987
I told you not to talk
to them clowns.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.257
I didn't call them,

36:31.290 --> 36:32.891
and I didn't tell them
anything, Tristan.

36:34.893 --> 36:37.363
Look, I'm not one of them
little punks on the street.

36:37.396 --> 36:41.233
So do me a favor... don't
talk to me like I am.

36:48.374 --> 36:50.376
I'm sorry, Unc.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.579
How much did they get anyway?

36:53.612 --> 36:57.349
Couple hundred dollars
out of the register.

36:57.383 --> 36:59.885
Couldn't open the safe.

36:59.918 --> 37:03.689
Why don't you put bars on the windows and
doors like everybody else on this street?

37:03.722 --> 37:06.392
I've been livin' and workin' in
this neighborhood all my life.

37:06.425 --> 37:09.995
I ain't never had no bars on the window.
I ain't about to start now.

37:10.028 --> 37:13.532
Times change.
You got that right.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.601
Twelve-year-olds
killin' each other.

37:15.634 --> 37:19.271
Goddamn psychopaths
everywhere you look.

37:19.305 --> 37:22.341
Look, I just came by
to make a bank run anyway.

37:22.374 --> 37:24.042
How much we got to deposit?

37:24.075 --> 37:26.412
About four grand.

37:32.318 --> 37:35.421
Cool.
Be safe.

37:35.454 --> 37:37.489
I will.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.758
Hey, look, Unc, um,

37:39.791 --> 37:42.328
I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier.
I didn't mean it.

37:42.361 --> 37:44.396
That's okay, Tristan.

37:46.665 --> 37:49.835
But you see what I'm talkin'
about, right? What?

37:49.868 --> 37:52.971
About the neighborhood. Yeah.
How things change. Yeah, I heard you.

37:53.004 --> 37:56.908
No, not just how things have
changed, but w they've changed.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.977
Have you asked yourself
that question?

37:59.010 --> 38:03.081
Come on, Unc. Things change.
Times are hard.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.451
No. There's more to it
than that.

38:05.484 --> 38:09.020
If you got somethin' you wanna say to
me, just go ahead and say it, Uncle Rob.

38:09.054 --> 38:11.623
Look, it's the rock, Tristan.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.792
Rock has fucked
this neighborhood up.

38:13.825 --> 38:17.529
No. Think about it.
There's junkies everywhere.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.598
It never used to be like that.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.368
Crack has got these people so wrapped
up, they're willin' to...

38:22.401 --> 38:25.103
To rob, to-to maim,
to kill anybody...

38:25.136 --> 38:27.473
just to get enough money
to get their next high.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.741
It was a crackhead
who broke in here.

38:29.775 --> 38:34.346
You don't know that.
Tristan, you got a reputation.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.448
You got a reputation
for murderin' people.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.717
Now, what motherfuck
in his right mind...

38:38.750 --> 38:41.028
is gonna risk robbin' this place
so you can find out who they are?

38:41.052 --> 38:44.823
You, E-Bone, Simon and Money, you
might as well be the motherfuckin' mob.

38:44.856 --> 38:48.093
Who's gonna go up against that for a
couple hundred dollars and some change?

38:48.126 --> 38:51.329
So some motherfuckin' crackhead came in
here and robbed us? That's just one case.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.534
You don't believe that,
and I know you don't.

38:57.403 --> 39:01.039
You don't wanna take responsibility,
but, hey, I can understand.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.809
Now you wanna blame me for all
the fucked-up shit in Boston?

39:03.842 --> 39:08.046
Crack is the problem, and you're the
biggest crack dealer in the Sound End.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.383
Fuck you, old man.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.396
God!
We set up crack houses...

39:24.430 --> 39:26.665
all over the South End.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.176
Blue Hill and Intervale was where
we made the bulk of our money.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.070
If you wanted cocaine,
you didn't come to us.

39:32.103 --> 39:34.873
You just phoned it in,
and we came to you.

39:34.906 --> 39:39.010
E-Bone did most of the cooking. He cooked
up to eight keys a day without fail.

39:39.044 --> 39:42.080
Then we asked someone from the
neighborhood we thought we could trust...

39:42.113 --> 39:45.517
to make sure that everything stayed
stocked and kept track of the weight.

39:45.551 --> 39:47.586
In the Blue Hill Ave house,
that was Buzz.

39:47.619 --> 39:51.089
Maceo chopped the keys
and broke them down into ounces.

39:51.122 --> 39:55.093
He added the benzocaine, the procaine or
vitamin B to the weight that was chopped.

39:55.126 --> 39:58.430
Day-Day would take the orders
over the phone, always in code,

39:58.464 --> 40:00.866
so no one listenin' would
know what was really goin' on.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.944
And then he'd hand each one
of them to the runners...

40:02.968 --> 40:06.538
along with a package
of what was ordered.

40:06.572 --> 40:10.742
Simon ran the house though.
In fact, he ran all the houses we had.

40:10.776 --> 40:12.611
'Cause it didn't matter
how bad you were,

40:12.644 --> 40:14.713
nobody fucked with Simon.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.948
- Nobody.
- Word.

40:16.982 --> 40:20.018
When Money wasn't gettin' laid,
he kept everyone in line.

40:20.051 --> 40:22.921
If anything went wrong, Marlon
was the first to know about it.

40:22.954 --> 40:26.024
Most of the time, the problem was
handled before I even knew about it.

40:26.057 --> 40:28.727
Hey, what the fuck is all
that noise out there, man?

40:53.151 --> 40:56.755
Hey, baby.
Hey.

40:56.788 --> 41:00.158
You okay?
Why wouldn't I be?

41:02.060 --> 41:04.462
'Cause you sittin' in here
in the dark.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.941
So.
What?

41:15.974 --> 41:17.976
What's goin' on?

41:21.312 --> 41:24.482
Remember that?

41:25.851 --> 41:28.954
Man. Where'd you
get this thing?

41:28.987 --> 41:30.822
I found it at the bottom
of my jewelry box.

41:33.124 --> 41:35.861
That thing is ugly.
Hey.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.996
My little eighth-grade
sweetie gave me that.

41:38.029 --> 41:41.567
Shut up. Well,
he had terrible taste in jewelry.

41:41.600 --> 41:44.903
Good taste in women.
Terrible taste in jewelry.

41:47.773 --> 41:50.308
So, what's the matter?

41:50.341 --> 41:52.221
Not quite workin' out
like we planned it, is it?

41:54.279 --> 41:56.114
"Workin' out"?
What do you mean?

41:56.147 --> 41:58.717
I mean,

41:58.750 --> 42:02.821
after 12 years of broken
promises, you still in the game.

42:02.854 --> 42:06.692
"Broken promises." The roof over your
head, clothes on your back.

42:06.725 --> 42:09.928
Those don't seem like broken
promises to me. That's survival.

42:09.961 --> 42:13.799
And, you know,
I believed that for a long time...

42:13.832 --> 42:16.267
You know, that "survival" thing.

42:16.301 --> 42:19.738
But look around you. We do a whole
lot better than just survive.

42:25.276 --> 42:27.646
What do you want from me?

42:30.048 --> 42:31.850
I want you to quit.

42:39.725 --> 42:42.661
Just like that?

42:42.694 --> 42:47.032
You know, you and Uncle Rob suffer from
the same damn disease... selective memory.

42:47.065 --> 42:51.870
I didn't hear none of this when we
went on vacation last year to Hawaii.

42:51.903 --> 42:54.248
And I didn't hear none of this two
years ago when your mother got sick...

42:54.272 --> 42:57.008
and couldn't pay
her damn hospital bills.

42:57.042 --> 42:58.986
You didn't have nothin' to say
about me quittin' then.

42:59.010 --> 43:01.112
What difference does
it make when I ask you?

43:01.146 --> 43:03.314
And, Tristan, you know
enough is enough.

43:03.348 --> 43:05.851
Well, I find it very interesting
that it's okay for me...

43:05.884 --> 43:10.355
to risk my life so that you can wear
this Gucci drawers frufru bullshit.

43:10.388 --> 43:13.124
But now that your stomach is full
and you ain't hungry no more,

43:13.158 --> 43:16.294
all of a sudden it's okay for
you to tell me it's time to quit?

43:16.327 --> 43:19.130
What's the matter,
Gucci ain't in style no more?

43:22.233 --> 43:24.870
I can't believe you just said that to me.
I call it like I see it.

43:24.903 --> 43:26.938
So that's what you think of me
after all this time,

43:26.972 --> 43:29.207
after all that we've
meant to each other.

43:29.240 --> 43:32.177
That's what you think of me? Look!
I don't need this shit right now! Okay?

43:34.780 --> 43:38.784
Martine, I can't quit right now.

43:38.817 --> 43:41.920

And I don't?

day I laid eyes on you, lovin' you,

43:46.357 --> 43:48.393
I can't believe I'm havin'
this conversation.

43:48.426 --> 43:50.662
It's because of them
fuckin' friends.

43:50.696 --> 43:54.332
It's them fuckin' friends are
all I've ever heard from you!

43:54.365 --> 43:56.401
If you thought...
I mean, really thought...

43:56.434 --> 43:59.671
That all I wanted to do was take from
you, then why'd you marry me?

43:59.705 --> 44:03.308
I'm not gonna do this with you.
If you want me, I'll be at the club.

44:03.341 --> 44:06.211
Don't you think we ought to squash
this before you just walk out?

44:06.244 --> 44:08.947
I'm not the one with the problem!
You are!

44:08.980 --> 44:11.225
Is that what you're gonna tell your child?
What did you just say?

44:11.249 --> 44:15.353
I didn't just ask you to quit all of
a sudden, Tristan. There was a reason.

44:15.386 --> 44:18.724
Yeah.

44:18.757 --> 44:22.227
Yeah, you guessed it, player.
I'm pregnant.

44:22.260 --> 44:26.164
You sure? No. I just pulled that
out of my ass and made it up.

44:26.197 --> 44:29.067
Then why the fuck you ain't
tell me when I came in here?

44:29.100 --> 44:33.805
I wanted to know if you would
quit because I asked you to,

44:33.839 --> 44:36.207
not because of the baby
and not even for yourself...

44:36.241 --> 44:38.409

54:50.521 --> 54:52.723
So I'll get with you
tomorrow, right?

54:54.525 --> 54:56.527
Go on.

55:16.080 --> 55:18.816
Wassup?
Wassup, yo?

55:18.849 --> 55:21.519
Where's everybody else?

55:21.552 --> 55:23.721
They didn't show.

55:23.754 --> 55:26.924
Shit.
Everything's gonna be cool.

55:26.957 --> 55:30.528
Long as me and you stick
together, it's gonna be a'ight.

55:31.996 --> 55:34.565
Look, I threw out
all the hype...

55:34.599 --> 55:37.835
and had Buzz and them
board up the place.

55:37.868 --> 55:40.028
That oughta convince Benny
that we really shut it down.

55:44.975 --> 55:47.878
You ready for this, man?
'Cause it's gonna get ugly.

55:47.912 --> 55:50.915
We ain't got no choice.
Quittin' ain't an option.

55:50.948 --> 55:52.983
Besides, E-Bone was right.

55:53.017 --> 55:55.920
With Benny gone,
we'll get a better price.

55:56.987 --> 55:59.424
Yeah.

55:59.457 --> 56:01.692
Get everybody together tonight.

56:01.726 --> 56:03.494
Figure out the best way
to do this thing.

56:03.528 --> 56:06.464
A'ight?
I'll see you tonight.

56:09.834 --> 56:12.503
Hey, yo, Tris.
Yeah.

56:14.739 --> 56:16.907
You know, somewhere
in the back of my mind,

56:16.941 --> 56:19.109
I knew one day
it would come to this...

56:19.143 --> 56:21.679
A beat-down
between us and Benny.

56:21.712 --> 56:24.148
It's like we were
meant to do that shit.

56:24.181 --> 56:27.084
- I feel you, yo.
- Like that car that night.

56:29.654 --> 56:33.458
After 12 years, man,
you still can't get over that thing?

56:33.491 --> 56:35.660
Somethin' about that car, dawg.

56:35.693 --> 56:39.664
- What?
- You don't think I'm stupid?

56:39.697 --> 56:42.733
Man, just say what the fuck
is on your mind.

56:42.767 --> 56:47.104
You know, part of me feel like I was
supposed to get hit by that car that night.

56:47.137 --> 56:50.875
It's like every second that I've lived
after that has been borrowed time.

56:50.908 --> 56:53.844
That's why shit don't scare me.

56:53.878 --> 56:57.582
'Cause maybe I ain't supposed to
be here anyway. What do you think?

56:57.615 --> 56:59.717
What do I think?

56:59.750 --> 57:03.688
I think thinkin' is the problem.

57:03.721 --> 57:07.925
You thinkin' too much.
Let me do the thinkin', all right?

57:07.958 --> 57:10.895
- What you sayin', I'm stupid?
- No. Hell, no. I ain't sayin' you stupid.

57:10.928 --> 57:12.906
I can't have no stupid
motherfuckers watchin' my back.

57:12.930 --> 57:15.533
But you didn't get hit
by that car that night.

57:15.566 --> 57:18.202
It missed you, and that's that.

57:18.235 --> 57:22.239
- That's 'cause you was lookin' out, dawg.
- Whatever, man.

57:22.272 --> 57:25.476
The point is, as far as
livin' on borrowed time,

57:25.510 --> 57:27.478
we all might be one step
away from the grave.

57:28.746 --> 57:33.684
All we gotta do...
is handle business,

57:33.718 --> 57:36.954
and everything gonna be
all right, a'ight?

57:39.023 --> 57:42.493
- All right, yo.
- Watch out! Watch out!

57:42.527 --> 57:44.929
What's he plan on doin'?

57:44.962 --> 57:48.032
Takin' us out.
He just needs an excuse.

57:48.065 --> 57:50.501
I knew I should've peeled
this cap right then and there.

57:50.535 --> 57:53.971
Well, well.

57:54.004 --> 57:57.642
You still have nothing,
or else you would've arrested me by now.

57:59.644 --> 58:03.180
Maybe, but I know what's runnin'
through your head right now.

58:03.213 --> 58:05.650
Yeah? And what's that?

58:05.683 --> 58:08.252
You're asking yourself,
"How did he get that tape?

58:08.285 --> 58:10.821
And now that he's got it,
what's he gonna do with it?"

58:10.855 --> 58:14.258
Let me tell you somethin'.

58:14.291 --> 58:16.927
I don't give a shit
where you got it,

58:16.961 --> 58:19.229
and you can shove that
shit right up your ass,

58:19.263 --> 58:22.600
'cause I'm quite sure
that shit's not admissible.

58:22.633 --> 58:24.635
Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't.

58:26.336 --> 58:29.874
But doesn't it bother you that one
of your crew dropped a dime on you,

58:29.907 --> 58:33.310
that right now we're working with one
of you to bring the rest of you down?

58:33.343 --> 58:37.915
This tape, it may not be enough
to convict you by itself,

58:37.948 --> 58:40.988
but it's just the first piece of evidence
in a long line of evidence to come.

58:45.055 --> 58:47.725
That's bullshit.

58:47.758 --> 58:49.994
How else would I get it then?

58:50.027 --> 58:52.707
How else would I know where you
guys were unless one of you told me?

58:55.099 --> 58:59.670
So, who was it then?
That's for you to find out.

58:59.704 --> 59:03.674
I got a hunch though.
I think you already know.

59:24.328 --> 59:26.831
We're closed, fellas.

59:31.636 --> 59:34.338
So what's it gonna take
to reopen?

59:34.371 --> 59:36.373
Not tonight.

59:36.406 --> 59:38.876
You gotta go, buddy.

59:38.909 --> 59:42.647
Look, two shots of bourbon,
a little information, we'll be on our way.

59:42.680 --> 59:44.281
What do you say?

59:51.321 --> 59:53.290
The shot I can do.

59:53.323 --> 59:58.362
If you want information,
dial 411.

59:58.395 --> 01:00:01.598
Maybe I'm not
makin' myself clear.

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:09.239
I'm lookin' for four brothers
that are running things out here.

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:12.176
T-Mack, E-Bone, Money and Simon.

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:14.679
- Ring a bell?
- Never heard of 'em.

01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:20.651
And you're sure about that?

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:26.190
Yeah? Trust me, amigo,
you won't make it.

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:28.325
Why don't you leave your number?

01:00:29.794 --> 01:00:32.329
What, are you looking
for some action, baby?

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:34.865
You ain't got to call me.
I got a truck right outside.

01:00:34.899 --> 01:00:37.702
- Watch your fuckin' mouth, Jack.
- Hey, fuck you, slim.

01:00:37.735 --> 01:00:41.005
- And don't be callin' me Jack.
- He didn't mean anything by it.

01:00:41.038 --> 01:00:43.808
Yeah? Well, I don't give a shit.
That happens to be my name.

01:00:43.841 --> 01:00:47.177
Besides, he doesn't know me well
enough to be callin' me by name.

01:00:47.211 --> 01:00:50.380
You are real close
to crossin' that line.

01:00:50.414 --> 01:00:53.818
And it's obvious you guys
ain't from around here.

01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:56.420
So why don't you
put away your gun now?

01:00:56.453 --> 01:01:00.257
I'll take your number and pass it on to
someone who might be able to help you.

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.392
And forget the whole thing.

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:05.696
If not, you're gonna
have a problem.

01:01:06.931 --> 01:01:08.799
Really? Yeah?

01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:10.801
You're scarin' me, baby.

01:01:10.835 --> 01:01:13.838
Well, it ain't me
you need to be worried about.

01:01:16.741 --> 01:01:19.043
All right, baby.

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:21.812
Pedro, put it away.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:29.153
Vinnie, give these guys
another round on the house...

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:32.189
and something to write with.

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:43.100
I'm gonna be at this number
till the end of the week.

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:45.435
After that, I'm gone.

01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:48.072
Where to?

01:01:48.105 --> 01:01:50.040
To Miami.

01:01:53.978 --> 01:01:57.181
- I'll see that they get it.
- Yeah, you do that.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:59.984
'Cause it'll be worth a whole
lot of dough to them if they do.

01:02:00.017 --> 01:02:03.220
And I mean a whole lot of dough.
For you too.

01:02:03.253 --> 01:02:07.324
Hell, maybe you can even buy
this place or a place like this.

01:02:07.357 --> 01:02:09.760
You should think
about that. You know?

01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:20.337

could mean a lot of money for you.

So, is that why you came down
here, to bring me a proposition?

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:40.017
He said there would be
something in it for me,

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:42.286
and I got a eye for business.

How do you know?
Maybe Tristan's wrong.

01:06:46.203 --> 01:06:49.039
Maybe Benny ain't got shit
planned for us.

That's not what you said the other day.

01:07:47.231 --> 01:07:49.566
I don't believe
this motherfucker.

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:52.102
That's right.
You better believe it, motherfucker,

01:07:52.136 --> 01:07:55.139
'cause I don't
trust your ass no more.

01:07:55.172 --> 01:07:59.443
- You don't trust me? - You the one
talkin' about walkin' out and shit.

01:07:59.476 --> 01:08:02.412
What's your real angle, Tristan?

01:08:02.446 --> 01:08:05.115
What the fuck
is you talkin' about, man?

01:08:05.149 --> 01:08:08.318
You know goddamn well what I'm
talkin' about, motherfucker.

01:08:08.352 --> 01:08:10.520
You tryin' to set us up.

01:08:10.554 --> 01:08:13.357
- Motherfucker, I oughta whup your ass!
- Man, fuck you!

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:16.626
Hey, look, man. Come on! Hey! Hey!

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.627
Why don't y'all motherfuckers

01:08:18.662 --> 01:08:21.274
I'm tired of this motherfucker always
comin' at me with this bullshit!

01:08:21.298 --> 01:08:24.401
The truth hurts, don't it?

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.243
All y'all feel like this?

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:37.481
I don't know what to think, man.

01:08:37.514 --> 01:08:40.450
But your ass is actin'

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:45.255
I'm actin' funny?

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:55.432
What about you, man?
You think I'm actin' funny too?

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:03.473
You too?

01:09:05.408 --> 01:09:08.212
Then fuck it then!

01:09:08.245 --> 01:09:10.555
Why don't y'all just go the
fuck ahead and do me right now?

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:20.957

to go down like this.

01:10:03.267 --> 01:10:05.201
You want a date?

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:09.639

Hey!

01:10:35.365 --> 01:10:38.568
What do you know about "years,"
little girl? You only eight.

01:10:38.602 --> 01:10:40.404
Yeah, but I'm an old soul.

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:50.714
Tris, how you doin'?
Tristan... Tristan, you got somethin'?

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:53.783
Joanie.
I just need a little bit, okay?

01:10:53.817 --> 01:10:55.485
Okay? I...

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:00.424
I'll suck you off.

01:11:00.457 --> 01:11:03.593
Shit. Come on, Joanie,
we gotta get you to the hospital.

01:11:03.627 --> 01:11:06.963
No.
No, that's okay.

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:10.600
Give me the keys, Tristan.

01:11:10.634 --> 01:11:13.637
Give me the goddamn keys,
Tristan! Come on!

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:17.807
No. No, no!
Simon! No!

01:11:17.841 --> 01:11:21.911
Paging Dr. Bender.
Paging Dr. Bender, please.

01:11:31.355 --> 01:11:33.289
How is she?

01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:36.059
We don't know yet.

01:11:36.092 --> 01:11:39.529
How'd you find her?

01:11:39.563 --> 01:11:42.766
Let's just say...
she found me.

01:11:46.936 --> 01:11:48.905
Pop, why didn't you even
tell me about Joanie?

01:11:48.938 --> 01:11:51.107
I didn't even know
she was missing!

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:54.911
What were you gonna do anyway,
Tristan, give her a family discount?

01:11:56.446 --> 01:12:00.717
- I don't deserve that, man.
- Yes, you do!

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:03.687
Blue Team to I.C.U., please.
Blue Team, I.C.U.

01:12:04.888 --> 01:12:07.056
How is she?

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:10.627
As a direct result of high
amounts of ether in her system,

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:13.463
she's developed
a hole in her esophagus.

01:12:13.497 --> 01:12:15.799
That hole started to bleed.

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:18.001
We've been able
to stop the bleeding,

01:12:18.034 --> 01:12:22.071
but I think she needs to remain in the hospital
a few days for observation and some tests.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.509
But she's okay?

01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:28.445
For now, she's stable.
Yes.

01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:33.583
- Can we see her? - We just gave
her a sedative. She's sleeping now.

01:12:33.617 --> 01:12:35.585
But you can go in.

01:12:35.619 --> 01:12:37.554
Thank you.

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:48.998
There's somethin' I've been
wantin' to ask you for a long time.

01:12:51.435 --> 01:12:55.705
We provided you a good home.
You could've been anything you wanted to.

01:12:55.739 --> 01:12:58.174
Why?

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.677
Why do you sell drugs, Tristan?

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:03.913
How do I tell my father,
like a twig in a tornado,

01:13:03.947 --> 01:13:05.915
I got caught up in this shit...

01:13:05.949 --> 01:13:08.418
That my loyalty to my friends
was like a curse...

01:13:08.452 --> 01:13:11.020
and a blessing at the same time?

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:13.890
Yet here he is, standing in front of
me, waiting for an answer.

01:13:13.923 --> 01:13:18.061
But I don't have one.
All I can say is:

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:20.430
'Cause I'm good at it.

01:13:22.632 --> 01:13:24.734
Tell Joanie I'll be by
to see her later.

01:13:33.176 --> 01:13:35.512
So what's up now, yo?

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:37.847
I'm out.
The price is too high.

01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:39.816
I'm out.

01:13:59.903 --> 01:14:02.071

I would've been surprised
if you wasn't here.

01:14:19.022 --> 01:14:21.758
God, you are so arrogant.

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:23.793
Yeah, well, you here, ain't ya?

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:31.801
So, what about this guy Jack?

01:14:31.835 --> 01:14:33.970
What about him?

01:14:34.003 --> 01:14:36.172
Are you gonna call him?
Maybe.

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:38.174
What's it gonna hurt
to talk to him?

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:41.010
Why you campaignin' so hard
for this dude?

01:14:41.044 --> 01:14:43.913
I told you... I get a cut.

01:14:43.947 --> 01:14:46.149
We already got a supplier.

01:14:46.182 --> 01:14:50.053
Maybe you know him. A big-headed,
ugly motherfucker named Benny.

01:14:50.086 --> 01:14:53.022
Who's overcharging you,
and you know it.

01:14:53.056 --> 01:14:57.627
You guys are paying 18 grand a
key when you should be paying 15.

01:14:57.661 --> 01:15:02.666
I think it makes good business
sense to keep all your options open.

01:15:02.699 --> 01:15:06.570
- How you know all this?
- I listen. I hear things.

01:15:06.603 --> 01:15:09.839
You got a sweet thing
with Benny.

01:15:09.873 --> 01:15:12.742
He got your ass set up
with that restaurant and shit.

01:15:12.776 --> 01:15:14.778
Why you tryin' so hard
to get out of it?

01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:17.180
I don't see a dime
from that place.

01:15:17.213 --> 01:15:19.983
I made that place,
and I don't see a dime.

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:22.786
I don't have anything
but what little bit he gives me,

01:15:22.819 --> 01:15:24.396
and he thinks that'll keep me
comin' around.

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:28.592
But I ain't lookin' to spend the
rest of my life makin' him rich.

01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:30.960
It ain't good to stay
in one place for too long.

01:15:30.994 --> 01:15:34.564
Sooner or later,
something or somebody catches up with you.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.303
How do you even know this
Jack motherfucker is a player?

01:15:40.336 --> 01:15:43.139
What if he's a cop?

01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:46.275
I been around enough players in the
game to know a cop when I see one.

01:15:46.309 --> 01:15:49.245
And he ain't no cop.

01:15:49.278 --> 01:15:52.081
But if you're so worried,
why don't you have him checked out?

01:15:52.115 --> 01:15:56.219
And if he does check out,
you willin' to go up against Benny?

01:15:56.252 --> 01:16:00.556
After what we just did,
you got the nerve to ask me that?

01:16:03.693 --> 01:16:05.629
You got a point there.

01:16:11.034 --> 01:16:13.603
Excuse me.
Mrs. Mackey?

01:16:14.838 --> 01:16:16.572
Can we ask you a few questions?

01:16:18.975 --> 01:16:21.310
I'm afraid I can't talk right now.
I'm very busy.

01:16:21.344 --> 01:16:24.147
That's not what you
said before, Martine.

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.149
I never should have helped you.

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:30.119
Hey, maybe that's the smartest thing
you ever did. What do you want?

01:16:30.153 --> 01:16:34.090
We just wanna help you help Tristan.
He's in a lot of trouble.

01:16:34.123 --> 01:16:36.660
The only chance he has of
gettin' out of it alive is us.

01:16:36.693 --> 01:16:39.896
You don't wanna
see him dead, right?

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:41.831
So we need
a little more information.

01:16:47.771 --> 01:16:51.007
Look, you've gotten all the
information you're gonna get from me.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.719
'Cause you don't wanna help Tristan.
You only wanna help yourselves.

01:16:53.743 --> 01:16:55.712
Excuse me.

01:16:55.745 --> 01:16:57.847
Don't be stupid, Martine.

01:17:00.216 --> 01:17:02.652
Dead is a long time.

01:17:03.419 --> 01:17:05.655
Fuck off.

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:10.894
Yeah, man.

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:26.943
Hi.

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:29.012
Hi there.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.082
Where were you?

01:17:33.116 --> 01:17:35.819
I went to the Vineyard.
Didn't you get my note?

01:17:37.954 --> 01:17:40.256
What note?

01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:51.334
This note?

01:17:51.367 --> 01:17:54.403
"Dear Tristan,

01:17:54.437 --> 01:17:58.407
"I went to have the chain you gave
me fixed because it was broken.

01:17:58.441 --> 01:18:01.110
"I know this little place in Oak
Bluffs that will do a good job.

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:07.817
"Thinkin' about us,
the chain reminds me how much I love you.

01:18:07.851 --> 01:18:10.219
"You do what you have to do
for us and for yourself,

01:18:10.253 --> 01:18:12.221
"just as you've always done,

01:18:12.255 --> 01:18:14.223
"and I'll be here
for better or for worse.

01:18:14.257 --> 01:18:17.393
No questions asked.
Martine."

01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:29.305
It looks nice.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.376
I love you, Tristan.

01:18:44.487 --> 01:18:46.489
You'd never keep anything
from me, Martine, right?

01:18:46.522 --> 01:18:48.491
Anything important,
I mean, right?

01:18:48.524 --> 01:18:50.994
Right.

01:18:51.027 --> 01:18:53.729
Why would you ask me that?

01:18:55.031 --> 01:18:57.433
Because trust is everything.

01:18:57.466 --> 01:19:01.037
Without it, you have nothing.
Do you agree?

01:19:03.106 --> 01:19:05.274
Yeah.

01:19:05.308 --> 01:19:08.177
Then what the fuck were
them cops doin' here then?

01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:09.979
They were here for you, Tristan.
Why?

01:19:10.013 --> 01:19:11.948
I don't know why.

01:19:13.549 --> 01:19:15.518
I don't know.
They didn't say.

01:19:15.551 --> 01:19:17.787
That's it? They didn't
say nothin' else?

01:19:17.821 --> 01:19:20.289
That's it.
They didn't say nothin' else.

01:19:34.003 --> 01:19:35.538
Look, Tristan, um...

01:19:37.974 --> 01:19:40.977
I don't feel well.
I'm just gonna go lie down, okay?

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:42.812
It's probably the baby
or somethin'.

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:48.384
Yeah, you should do that.

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:05.134
Shit.

01:20:13.609 --> 01:20:15.344
Fuck.

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:26.455
Who is it?

01:20:26.489 --> 01:20:28.524
It's me, young pimp.
I need to rap to ya.

01:20:30.994 --> 01:20:33.429
Twinkie?
Yeah.

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:45.174
You know
what fuckin' time it is?

01:20:45.208 --> 01:20:47.944
It's about 4:00 a.m.

01:20:47.977 --> 01:20:50.113
What you doin' here, man?

01:20:50.146 --> 01:20:52.548
Like I said,
I came to rap to ya.

01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:55.384
You don't know me, motherfucker.

01:20:55.418 --> 01:20:57.954
Don't ever just show up
at my fuckin' crib.

01:20:57.987 --> 01:21:00.132
Let me know when you're through
actin' like a little bitch.

01:21:00.156 --> 01:21:03.592
What'd you say?

01:21:03.626 --> 01:21:07.630
Look, I know you don't think I came
over here for my motherfuckin' health.

01:21:07.663 --> 01:21:10.934
I got business with you, boy,
and the sooner you stop fuckin' around,

01:21:10.967 --> 01:21:14.503
we can get to it and I
can be on my fuckin' way.

01:21:22.979 --> 01:21:25.459
You got three seconds to say what
the hell it is you gonna say.

01:21:26.315 --> 01:21:28.484
Not in the hallway.

01:21:28.517 --> 01:21:30.553
Five minutes inside,
then I'm out.

01:21:37.093 --> 01:21:39.028
Come on in.

01:21:49.538 --> 01:21:52.575
Can I get a drink?

01:21:54.577 --> 01:21:58.114
Say what the fuck you gonna say,
man, and get the hell outta here.

01:21:58.147 --> 01:22:00.349
Can I at least sit down?

01:22:00.383 --> 01:22:02.185
Sit down, motherfucker.
Damn!

01:22:16.665 --> 01:22:20.970
Look, this ain't no easy thing to
say, so I'm just gonna say it.

01:22:21.004 --> 01:22:23.973
Your mother used to be a ho.

01:22:24.007 --> 01:22:25.941
She worked for me
until just after you was born.

01:22:30.013 --> 01:22:32.348
Is that what you came here
to tell me?

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:36.219
You don't seem surprised.

01:22:36.252 --> 01:22:39.455
I ain't no kid, motherfucker.

01:22:39.488 --> 01:22:42.191
I been around a long time,

01:22:42.225 --> 01:22:44.193
seen a lot of shit.

01:22:46.429 --> 01:22:48.589
You gonna have to come better
than that to surprise me.

01:22:51.534 --> 01:22:54.270
She ever tell you
about your father?

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:57.373
She said he was a salesman or
some shit out on the coast.

01:23:00.076 --> 01:23:02.111
She lied, man.

01:23:02.145 --> 01:23:03.679
I'm your father.

01:23:13.722 --> 01:23:17.326
There you go with that bullshit again.
You need to shut the fuck up.

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:20.629
Man, why would I say some shit
like that if it wasn't true?

01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:23.566
Well, if she was a ho
like you say she was,

01:23:23.599 --> 01:23:25.534
how the fuck you know
who my father is?

01:23:40.316 --> 01:23:43.018
When she got pregnant,
Violet decided to quit hoin'.

01:23:44.587 --> 01:23:47.223
She was in love with me,
and she thought we was a family.

01:23:48.557 --> 01:23:51.160
She was one of
my best girls, man.

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:55.064
I just wanted to prove to her
you wasn't mine,

01:23:55.098 --> 01:23:58.667
convince her to give you up for adoption
so she and I could keep rollin', you know.

01:23:58.701 --> 01:24:02.271
She swore up and down
you was mine,

01:24:02.305 --> 01:24:04.707
and damn if she wasn't right.

01:24:07.143 --> 01:24:09.712
It's true, man.
I ain't lyin'.

01:24:09.745 --> 01:24:12.381
So why you tellin' me
this shit now?

01:24:16.319 --> 01:24:19.255
'Cause I made another promise...

01:24:19.288 --> 01:24:21.257
to myself...

01:24:21.290 --> 01:24:23.259
that,

01:24:23.292 --> 01:24:26.095
before one of us... died,

01:24:27.296 --> 01:24:29.265
we'd both know the truth.

01:24:38.807 --> 01:24:40.543
You sick, man?

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:44.647
Can you just get me
a glass of water?

01:24:55.391 --> 01:24:57.326
Twinkie.

01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:05.601
Why didn't you just kill Benny
when you had the chance, man?

01:25:05.634 --> 01:25:07.470
What?

01:25:07.503 --> 01:25:10.639
You and your friends...
You got too large.

01:25:10.673 --> 01:25:12.641
You made him nervous.

01:25:12.675 --> 01:25:14.643
Then you gave him an excuse.

01:25:14.677 --> 01:25:17.780
What the fuck
you talkin' about, man?

01:25:17.813 --> 01:25:20.549
Blue Hill Ave, man.
We closed that place down.

01:25:20.583 --> 01:25:23.252
We're not doin' business
out of there anymore.

01:25:23.286 --> 01:25:24.853
Well, one of you still is.

01:25:24.887 --> 01:25:27.923
Look, Simon,

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.259
he's got me, man.

01:25:31.327 --> 01:25:33.262
I got to do this.

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.940
I got homeys...

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:47.376
that'll hunt you down
till you drop.

01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:51.647
They gonna be dead
soon after you.

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:32.421
Forgive me, son.

01:26:55.811 --> 01:26:58.013
Simon was my best friend.

01:26:58.046 --> 01:27:00.015
It was all startin'
to fall apart.

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:03.519
He was gone, and the only thing
I could do for him now was pray...

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:05.654
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."

01:27:33.716 --> 01:27:37.286
Miss Davis,
I don't know what to say.

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:39.622
I'm real sorry.

01:27:39.655 --> 01:27:44.026
I thought everything was gonna be okay
now that Thomas was back in his life.

01:27:44.059 --> 01:27:46.929
Thomas?
You knew him better as Twinkie.

01:27:48.797 --> 01:27:51.434
Well, what's Twinkie doin'
in Simon's life?

01:27:51.467 --> 01:27:53.569
He's his father.

01:27:56.672 --> 01:27:59.642
Now, you'd think
he'd care enough...

01:27:59.675 --> 01:28:02.711
to show up for his own son's...

01:28:06.882 --> 01:28:10.353
Why weren't you there
for my boy, Tristan?

01:28:10.386 --> 01:28:13.288
He would've been there for you.

01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:16.825
Let me go!

01:28:36.412 --> 01:28:38.347
You all right, man?

01:28:41.417 --> 01:28:43.352
No.

01:28:46.088 --> 01:28:47.856
What's the word?

01:28:49.124 --> 01:28:52.495
Simon's soldiers
are fightin' for power.

01:28:52.528 --> 01:28:55.964
They ain't gonna be no good
to us if we war with Benny.

01:28:55.998 --> 01:28:58.401
And without Simon,
my people won't budge.

01:28:58.434 --> 01:29:02.137
Hell, I can't even get the motherfuckers
to return a page, never mind combat.

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:05.040
Everybody knows Benny killed Simon.
Maybe he didn't pull the trigger.

01:29:05.073 --> 01:29:07.843
But they figure that we ain't
got a chance now.

01:29:07.876 --> 01:29:10.813
So, they don't wanna be
around when he comes after us.

01:29:13.015 --> 01:29:16.919
Ain't nobody talkin' about
who d pull the trigger? Nah.

01:29:16.952 --> 01:29:18.921
But Buzz said
when they found him,

01:29:18.954 --> 01:29:21.424
there was "T-W" written
in blood on the floor.

01:29:21.457 --> 01:29:24.493
But that can mean anything. We gotta
figure out what the fuck we gonna do.

01:29:30.566 --> 01:29:32.935
That ain't got nothin'
to do with me.

01:29:32.968 --> 01:29:35.037
Come on now, T.

01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:36.910
So, what, you just gonna
leave us hangin', man?

01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:43.679
Did you say "T-W"?

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:46.014
Yeah, man, but that
could mean anything!

01:29:50.653 --> 01:29:54.757
Simon!
My baby.

01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:59.127
God.

01:29:59.161 --> 01:30:01.730
What?

01:30:01.764 --> 01:30:05.668
- I know who did it.
- Who?

01:30:05.701 --> 01:30:08.637
I'll tell you on the way.
Come on. Let's go.

01:30:13.709 --> 01:30:15.878
Martine.

01:30:17.179 --> 01:30:19.848
I gotta go.
I got somethin' I gotta do.

01:30:21.183 --> 01:30:23.686
You're gonna go after him,
aren't you?

01:30:26.822 --> 01:30:28.791
Look, I don't want you
to go back to the house.

01:30:28.824 --> 01:30:31.126
Take the car and go to
your father's house. Why?

01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:32.928
'Cause ain't nobody
gonna find you in Malden.

01:30:32.961 --> 01:30:34.897
Tristan...

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:39.702
Okay.

01:30:41.504 --> 01:30:44.473
- Is he here for you?
- No, Tristan.

01:30:44.507 --> 01:30:47.810
- Why would you even think that?
- Stop the game! I know it was you.

01:30:47.843 --> 01:30:51.680
You broke my heart.
Tristan, he said he wanted to help you.

01:30:51.714 --> 01:30:54.750
- And you believed him?
- Yes! I wanted to believe him!

01:30:54.783 --> 01:30:58.020
Because I wanted you out of this so bad!
So I thought I was helping.

01:30:58.053 --> 01:31:00.198
That's how you help?
Help him put a bug in Simon's car?

01:31:00.222 --> 01:31:03.125
What? No, I wouldn't do that.

01:31:03.158 --> 01:31:05.894
I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't
help him do something like that!

01:31:05.928 --> 01:31:08.230
- Ain't no sense in lyin' now.
- I'm not lying, Tristan!

01:31:08.263 --> 01:31:10.633
I didn't do that.

01:31:10.666 --> 01:31:13.168
I told them when Rob's barbershop
got broken into. That's it.

01:31:13.201 --> 01:31:15.137
What?

01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:18.607
Torrance and Tyler
came up to me a while ago,

01:31:18.641 --> 01:31:20.909
and they asked me if I wanted
to tell them anything.

01:31:20.943 --> 01:31:23.579
If there's anything that I had
to tell them, to give 'em a call.

01:31:23.612 --> 01:31:26.057
But I didn't tell you because I
know how you feel about the police.

01:31:26.081 --> 01:31:28.617
But, for some reason,
I thought that they could help me.

01:31:28.651 --> 01:31:30.719
So, when Rob's barbershop
got broken into,

01:31:30.753 --> 01:31:32.921
I gave Torrance and Tyler
a call.

01:31:32.955 --> 01:31:36.659
They came down. I thought that they
could help, but they didn't help.

01:31:36.692 --> 01:31:38.794
And all they did was,
was harass you that day.

01:31:38.827 --> 01:31:41.730
And I thought that...

01:31:41.764 --> 01:31:44.166
All they did was use me
to try and get to you.

01:31:44.199 --> 01:31:47.135
But I swear to God, that's all I told 'em.
I didn't say anything else.

01:31:47.169 --> 01:31:49.872
I swear.
All right. All right.

01:31:51.907 --> 01:31:54.209
- I believe you.
- That's all I did.

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:56.278
I wouldn't set Simon up.
I wouldn't do that.

01:31:56.311 --> 01:31:58.814
All right. All right.
I swear it.

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:02.585
I'm so sorry.
I believe you.

01:32:05.287 --> 01:32:07.690
I gotta go.
No, I gotta go.

01:32:07.723 --> 01:32:09.592
No questions asked,
remember? Come on.

01:32:09.625 --> 01:32:11.760
Come on now.
Come on.

01:32:11.794 --> 01:32:13.528
No questions asked.

01:32:15.297 --> 01:32:18.033
I'll see you later
at your father's house.

01:32:18.066 --> 01:32:20.002
I promise.

01:32:36.018 --> 01:32:37.920
A'ight. So who did it, man?

01:32:37.953 --> 01:32:40.723
Twinkie.

01:32:40.756 --> 01:32:42.925
Twinkie?

01:32:42.958 --> 01:32:45.828
Why in the fuck would
Twinkie wanna kill Simon?

01:32:45.861 --> 01:32:48.230
Benny sent him.

01:32:48.263 --> 01:32:50.766
He knew Twinkie could
get close to him.

01:32:50.799 --> 01:32:52.334
How in the hell he know that?

01:32:54.703 --> 01:32:56.639
Twinkie was Simon's father.

01:32:57.673 --> 01:32:59.608
Damn.

01:33:01.276 --> 01:33:04.112
That's what that "T-W"
stands for.

01:33:04.146 --> 01:33:07.015
Son of a bitch.
Yep.

01:33:07.049 --> 01:33:10.285
Simon was tryin' to let
us know who murdered him.

01:33:50.058 --> 01:33:54.162
One string is pulled
as the quilt begins to unravel,

01:33:54.196 --> 01:33:57.065
and Simon is dead,
six feet under,

01:33:57.099 --> 01:33:59.668
covered by dirt and gravel.

01:33:59.702 --> 01:34:02.905
Now your travels
have led you astray...

01:34:02.938 --> 01:34:06.308
as you stand at the pitchfork
of life deciding which way.

01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:10.779
Will law of the four
slain down to three...

01:34:10.813 --> 01:34:12.915
wait for more?

01:34:12.948 --> 01:34:16.118
Not knowing left from right,

01:34:16.151 --> 01:34:18.854
as tear-filled eyes
become quarried.

01:34:18.887 --> 01:34:22.991
See, your determination
superseded your high education,

01:34:23.025 --> 01:34:25.961
and, instead, you became
a street scholar.

01:34:25.994 --> 01:34:27.963
You bled, broke bread,

01:34:27.996 --> 01:34:30.933
as you knew the other three
would follow.

01:34:30.966 --> 01:34:32.935
But now you a man.

01:34:32.968 --> 01:34:36.204
Your aura, melancholy.

01:34:36.238 --> 01:34:39.107
Your reign over Boston begins,

01:34:39.141 --> 01:34:41.777
Tristan, Simon,

01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:44.312
E-Bone and Money.

01:34:44.346 --> 01:34:47.750

01:34:47.783 --> 01:34:50.753

01:35:03.498 --> 01:35:05.801
I'm gonna ask y'all
one fuckin' question,

01:35:05.834 --> 01:35:08.203
and I need to know
the straight-up truth.

01:35:08.236 --> 01:35:11.874
Did either one of y'all
let that cop...

01:35:11.907 --> 01:35:15.410
Torrance put a bug in Simon's car
the night we left Benny's loft?

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:19.514
- Hell, no, man!
- Fuck, no.

01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:21.984
He came to see me a couple of
days after that, and he had...

01:35:22.017 --> 01:35:24.486
A tape...
With us in the car that night.

01:35:24.519 --> 01:35:27.055
Tyler came at me
with that same bullshit.

01:35:27.089 --> 01:35:29.157
So they came at y'all
with the same thing then?

01:35:29.191 --> 01:35:31.359
He must've came to Simon too.
He came to all of us,

01:35:31.393 --> 01:35:33.862
hopin' that one of us
would dime the other three out.

01:35:33.896 --> 01:35:35.998
And it almost worked, man.

straight out of your mouths,

my homeys, man.

We need you, man.

01:36:12.334 --> 01:36:14.769
We need you back with us.

Don't worry about that.

I can't relax.
I still can't fuckin' calm down.

01:36:37.926 --> 01:36:40.538
Maybe if you would just tell me what
the problem was, I could help you.

01:36:40.562 --> 01:36:43.098
No.

01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:45.100
No.

money. Where do you think I'm going?

Get me a beer before you leave.

01:37:13.528 --> 01:37:16.498
No.

take the weight.

01:40:46.808 --> 01:40:50.078
- I can do 13.
- Yeah, well, I can only do 15.

01:40:50.112 --> 01:40:53.181
We got a deal at 14.

01:40:53.215 --> 01:40:56.651
- Yeah? Fourteen-five, then.
- I test at random.

01:40:56.684 --> 01:40:58.653

01:40:58.686 --> 01:41:00.622

At a warehouse.

01:41:00.655 --> 01:41:04.259
Sumner Tunnel.
Behind the airport.

01:41:04.292 --> 01:41:06.461
In two hours.

01:41:06.494 --> 01:41:10.298

"We"?

01:41:10.332 --> 01:41:14.569
- Yeah, there's four of us.
- All right. I'm three deep.

01:41:14.602 --> 01:41:16.538
- All right, you're on then.
- Yeah.

01:41:22.144 --> 01:41:25.513
They stayin' at the old tech building.
Near the airport.

01:41:25.547 --> 01:41:29.684
I'm gonna get a room across the street at
the Rustic so we can keep an eye on 'em.

01:41:29.717 --> 01:41:32.820
- I ain't tryin' to get set up here.
- Yeah, I feel you. I feel you.

01:41:32.854 --> 01:41:36.591
Shit, that's cool then. That should be
enough to set us all up somewhere else.

01:41:36.624 --> 01:41:38.526
We can get some shit
jumpin' off in St. Louis.

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:40.828
I ain't leavin' Boston.

01:41:40.862 --> 01:41:43.365
I feel you on not wantin'
to leave, Tristan,

01:41:43.398 --> 01:41:45.467
but without Simon,
we ain't got no choice, man.

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:48.436
- We can't win.
- I'll take my chances.

01:41:50.405 --> 01:41:52.774
You still gonna roll
with us though, right?

01:41:52.807 --> 01:41:56.411
Somethin' in the pit
told me not to go.

01:41:56.444 --> 01:42:00.415
And I really meant to say,
"No, I'm goin' home, man."

01:42:00.448 --> 01:42:02.650
But what came out was:

01:42:02.684 --> 01:42:04.519
Yeah, I'll roll.

01:42:06.788 --> 01:42:09.824
Cool. Look, I'm gonna meet y'all there.
I gotta go handle somethin'.

01:42:09.857 --> 01:42:12.860
- Don't be bullshittin', a'ight.

01:42:44.759 --> 01:42:47.295
I don't know.

01:42:47.329 --> 01:42:50.365
Why is it that I think you're lyin'?
Fuck you, man!

01:42:50.398 --> 01:42:53.935
No, man. Fuck you, motherfucker!
You're done, man. You're history.

01:42:53.968 --> 01:42:57.672
We know you're doin' business
down on Blue Hill. We know that.

01:42:57.705 --> 01:43:00.675
Your buddy Simon got killed behind
that shit. Did you know that?

01:43:00.708 --> 01:43:03.278
You brought down your whole
fuckin' crew with that shit.

01:43:03.311 --> 01:43:05.280
But we can help you
get away scot-free.

01:43:05.313 --> 01:43:08.550
Look, we know you got an out, E.

01:43:08.583 --> 01:43:10.685
Maybe plannin' on doin'
a little bit of business...

01:43:10.718 --> 01:43:12.687
with the new heavy hitter
in town...

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:14.889
What's his name... Jack?

01:43:14.922 --> 01:43:18.593
You can get a little weight
to flip wherever you land.

01:43:18.626 --> 01:43:20.828
Am I right?

01:43:20.862 --> 01:43:22.597
I'm right, aren't I?

01:43:23.865 --> 01:43:26.868
I'm listenin', motherfucker.
All right.

01:43:26.901 --> 01:43:29.837
Whatever you make
from that deal is yours.

01:43:29.871 --> 01:43:32.874
Now you just make sure that Tristan
is there when it all goes down,

01:43:32.907 --> 01:43:35.777
and at least one of those Cuban
motherfuckers winds up dead,

01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:37.912
so that we can
pin it on Tristan.

01:43:37.945 --> 01:43:39.914
You call us when it happens.

01:43:39.947 --> 01:43:43.885
You hold him there
until we arrive.

01:43:43.918 --> 01:43:47.389
Now, you do that, and you can walk away
with whatever you're holdin'... free bird.

01:43:47.422 --> 01:43:50.392
Man, why y'all got it
so bad for Tristan?

01:43:50.425 --> 01:43:52.394
Simon's the muscle
and Tristan's the brains.

01:43:52.427 --> 01:43:54.529
Without him,
you wouldn't have made it past 16...

01:43:54.562 --> 01:43:56.631
without a rap sheet
as long as your arm.

01:43:56.664 --> 01:43:59.767
He goes down,
and we're the one's bringin' him down.

01:43:59.801 --> 01:44:02.504
You and Money are just peons.
We don't give a shit about you.

01:44:02.537 --> 01:44:06.007
Simon's already dead.
We want Tristan.

01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:09.444
Besides, it was Tristan who planted
the bug in the car for us that night.

01:44:09.477 --> 01:44:12.347
Man, that's bullshit!
Why, because he said so?

01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:16.418
What the fuck else you think
he's gonna say? It was him!

01:44:16.451 --> 01:44:19.387
Now, he knew you couldn't
win a war against Benny.

01:44:19.421 --> 01:44:22.757
And he's just doin' what he
always does... cover his ass.

01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:26.594
Well, maybe I'll take my chances
of gettin' out of here without you.

01:44:26.628 --> 01:44:30.398
What, and have to split
the take with Tristan and Money?

01:44:30.432 --> 01:44:33.568
Ain't gonna be much left for your honeymoon
over here with "Miss Bim-From-Bo."

01:44:33.601 --> 01:44:35.937
Can you live with that?

01:44:35.970 --> 01:44:39.674
See, our way, you take all the money... and
all the drugs for that matter. I don't care.

01:44:39.707 --> 01:44:42.477
You slip out of town nice and easy.
We get Tristan.

01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:44.078
We leave Money
to deal with Benny.

But while we on the subject,

01:52:58.605 --> 01:53:00.374
what made you come here?

01:53:00.407 --> 01:53:02.576
Two reasons.

01:53:02.609 --> 01:53:06.080
Number one:
To show you...

01:53:07.949 --> 01:53:10.818
that you could not beat me.

01:53:10.852 --> 01:53:13.320
Which brings me to number two.
I want out.

01:53:13.354 --> 01:53:16.123
I want my life back.

01:53:16.157 --> 01:53:19.593

but I'm out of the game forever.

The briefcase.

01:53:26.233 --> 01:53:28.870
The money.

01:53:28.903 --> 01:53:31.438
If that's not enough...

01:53:39.346 --> 01:53:41.282
Chill.

01:53:44.886 --> 01:53:47.054
I walk outta here...

01:53:47.088 --> 01:53:50.291
and the slate
is clean between us.

01:53:50.324 --> 01:53:52.393
What makes you think...

01:53:52.426 --> 01:53:54.395
I'm gonna let you
walk outta here?

01:54:05.439 --> 01:54:09.076
Two reasons.
Number one:

01:54:10.611 --> 01:54:14.215
I know you respect me too much
to shoot me in my back.

01:54:22.957 --> 01:54:25.126
And the second one?

01:54:27.628 --> 01:54:29.596
I want you
to do something for me.

01:54:29.630 --> 01:54:32.599
Sure. What you need?

01:54:32.633 --> 01:54:35.436
I want you to kill Simon.

01:54:35.469 --> 01:54:38.039
Simon who?

01:54:38.072 --> 01:54:40.607
How many Simons
you know, motherfucker?

01:54:40.641 --> 01:54:43.610
Shit. I can't do that, man.

01:54:43.644 --> 01:54:46.447
You got no choice.

01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:49.150
Shit, he's my son, Benny.
You know that.

01:54:49.183 --> 01:54:54.055
And I ain't been much of a father to
him, but goddamn, I can't kill him.

01:54:54.088 --> 01:54:58.960
Yeah, that's why
he won't be expecting it.

01:55:01.495 --> 01:55:03.464
Well, I won't do it.

01:55:03.497 --> 01:55:05.699
Go ahead and kill me.
I ain't doin' it.

01:55:05.732 --> 01:55:07.969
Go ahead. Shoot me right now.
Fuck it.

01:55:14.475 --> 01:55:17.278
You know that's not
my style, Tommy.

01:55:21.748 --> 01:55:24.986
Remember about 12 years back?

01:55:25.019 --> 01:55:27.721
That little white cutie
who used to work for you.

01:55:27.754 --> 01:55:30.291
What was her name?

01:55:30.324 --> 01:55:32.426
Lloyd, please, slow down.

01:55:32.459 --> 01:55:34.237
You almost killed
that kid back there. Please!

01:55:34.261 --> 01:55:36.630
Shut the fuck up!
Okay?

01:55:36.663 --> 01:55:39.066
I can't fuckin' believe you.

01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:41.820
I've been looking for you for two months.
Two fuckin' months, Monica.

01:55:42.569 --> 01:55:46.007
- Monica.
- Yeah.

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:48.442
That's right... Monica.

01:55:48.475 --> 01:55:50.511
Why do you do this?

01:55:50.544 --> 01:55:53.981
What do you... I mean,
what the fuck did you do?

01:55:54.015 --> 01:55:57.218
What did you say? Just thinking of
letting that fuckin' nigger touch you,

01:55:57.251 --> 01:56:00.354
all those nigger tricks do shit to
you, it makes me wanna...

01:56:00.387 --> 01:56:02.523
It makes me wanna fuckin' puke.

01:56:02.556 --> 01:56:05.492
Now, it's a shame
she turned up dead.

01:56:05.526 --> 01:56:07.728
They found her body
in a Dumpster...

01:56:07.761 --> 01:56:10.998
a couple of blocks behind
Sam's old place if I recall.

01:56:11.032 --> 01:56:13.734
You shut your fuckin' mouth,
Lloyd. Do you hear me?

01:56:13.767 --> 01:56:16.737
Don't you ever call him that.
Ever! He loves me.

01:56:16.770 --> 01:56:19.606
He fuckin' turned you
out, Monica!

01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:22.109
Her boyfriend did that after
he found out she was trickin'.

01:56:22.143 --> 01:56:24.387
- Shit, I ain't had nothin' to do with that.
- He loves me.

01:56:24.411 --> 01:56:26.547
Loves you?
He fuckin' turned you out, Monica.

01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:29.316
That nigger.
He fuckin' turned you out.

01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:32.053
He's more of a fuckin' man
than you'll ever be.

01:56:36.823 --> 01:56:39.160
What did you just say?
I'm sorry.

01:56:39.193 --> 01:56:41.128
I think you did it.

01:56:41.162 --> 01:56:43.497
At least I can have...

01:56:43.530 --> 01:56:46.067
my people to make it
look like you did it.

01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:48.569
They never caught the boyfriend.

01:56:48.602 --> 01:56:52.239
And there ain't no statute
of limitations on murder.

01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:57.344
Shit, I done time before.

01:56:57.378 --> 01:56:59.713
Not for murder, you haven't.

01:56:59.746 --> 01:57:03.050
And this is Murder One.

01:57:03.084 --> 01:57:06.453
Now, you wait till the D.A.
finds out that a big black pimp...

01:57:06.487 --> 01:57:09.556
turned out an innocent
lily-white girl...

01:57:09.590 --> 01:57:11.758
and then killed her.

01:57:11.792 --> 01:57:16.097
Shit. You'd be lucky
to get life.

01:57:16.130 --> 01:57:18.732
And that's hard time too.

01:57:18.765 --> 01:57:22.536
The rest of your motherfuckin'
life in a rat-infested cage.

01:57:22.569 --> 01:57:24.638
Now you think about that.

01:57:26.173 --> 01:57:28.542
Now what it comes down to...

01:57:28.575 --> 01:57:30.744
is your life...

01:57:30.777 --> 01:57:34.448
or the life of a motherfucker
who don't mean nothin' to you.

01:57:36.850 --> 01:57:39.386
Your life ain't much,

01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:42.323
but it's gotta mean
something to you.

01:57:42.356 --> 01:57:44.558
Now we can avoid all that...

01:57:44.591 --> 01:57:48.329
by you doing me
this simple favor.

01:57:55.236 --> 01:57:57.371
He's my son, Benny.

01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:02.243
You brought him in the world,

01:58:02.276 --> 01:58:04.211
and you're gonna take him out.

01:58:05.546 --> 01:58:07.848
And I want it done
before the week is out.

01:58:07.881 --> 01:58:11.685
Tristan gonna come after me
with everything he got, man.

01:58:15.222 --> 01:58:17.658
Don't you worry about Tristan.

01:58:17.691 --> 01:58:21.662
We got a party planned
for that little motherfucker...

01:58:21.695 --> 01:58:23.730
right after Simon's funeral.

01:58:27.668 --> 01:58:29.470
You need an ashtray?

01:58:33.574 --> 01:58:36.343
That there motherfucker's
a Persian rug.

01:58:43.284 --> 01:58:45.252
A'ight, man.

01:58:49.223 --> 01:58:51.158
A'ight.

01:58:54.228 --> 01:58:56.797
Get the fuck outta my sight.

01:59:10.844 --> 01:59:14.181
Torrance and Tyler
put a wire on Twinkie...

01:59:14.215 --> 01:59:16.583
just in case
you tried to cross 'em.

01:59:16.617 --> 01:59:18.852
Twinkie made a copy of the tape.

01:59:22.889 --> 01:59:25.559
Cops worked for you the whole
time, didn't they?

01:59:28.329 --> 01:59:30.497
That's how they were able
to put the bug in the car.

01:59:31.765 --> 01:59:33.900
You told 'em
we were gonna be here.

01:59:37.604 --> 01:59:40.707
That was the real reason you
wanted us here, wasn't it?

01:59:44.311 --> 01:59:47.514
Cops were smart.

01:59:47.548 --> 01:59:50.884
They didn't talk the whole
time the tape was running.

01:59:50.917 --> 01:59:54.255
And you didn't
mention 'em by name.

01:59:55.856 --> 02:00:01.228
So that leaves you
to take the fall...

02:00:01.262 --> 02:00:03.430
all by yourself.

02:00:04.865 --> 02:00:07.501
Put the motherfuckin' guns down.

02:00:29.823 --> 02:00:33.860
You keep that as a souvenir.

02:00:36.530 --> 02:00:39.333
I got others.

02:00:39.366 --> 02:00:41.602
A lot of others.

02:00:42.803 --> 02:00:44.538
I told you.

02:00:49.443 --> 02:00:52.646
You could never beat me.

02:00:54.381 --> 02:00:56.317
Was good seeing you.

02:00:57.851 --> 02:00:59.786
Fellas.

02:01:15.502 --> 02:01:17.604
I told Benny that I beat him,

02:01:17.638 --> 02:01:19.740
but I was as big a loser
as he was.

02:01:19.773 --> 02:01:22.343
My parents were strangers
to me now.

02:01:22.376 --> 02:01:24.478
Joanie was hangin' on
by a thread.

02:01:24.511 --> 02:01:26.680
I miss Marlon and even E-Bone,

02:01:26.713 --> 02:01:28.849
who in some ways
was closer to me than anyone.

02:01:28.882 --> 02:01:31.385
Deep down inside,
I think Ed was right.

02:01:31.418 --> 02:01:34.488
I didn't do it for friendship.
I did it for myself.

02:01:34.521 --> 02:01:36.523
He was the only one
who figured that out.

02:01:36.557 --> 02:01:39.560
I think that's why
he was so angry.

02:01:39.593 --> 02:01:44.565
And Simon. I knew something had
been haunting him all these years.

02:01:44.598 --> 02:01:47.934
His mother's words
ring in my ears.

02:01:47.968 --> 02:01:51.338
I should have been there,
but I couldn't save him this time.

02:01:51.372 --> 02:01:53.540
I'll miss him the most.

02:01:53.574 --> 02:01:56.377
The family I had known
for the last 12 years was dead,

02:01:56.410 --> 02:01:58.879
and there was no one
to blame but me.

02:01:58.912 --> 02:02:01.748
The thought of that
was just too much to take.

02:02:01.782 --> 02:02:04.951
Motherfuck... Mother...

02:02:04.985 --> 02:02:07.588
Motherfuckin'... Motherfuckin'...

02:02:20.867 --> 02:02:24.838
Hey, man.
You movin' on or what?

02:02:24.871 --> 02:02:27.574
Yeah. Sorry.

02:02:34.781 --> 02:02:37.884
My man didn't know
just how right he was.

02:02:37.918 --> 02:02:40.787
I was moving on.

02:02:40.821 --> 02:02:43.424
I regret a lot of the things
I've done.

02:02:43.457 --> 02:02:46.927
Maybe if we never took
that stash from Lathan that day,

02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:50.931
maybe none of this
would have ever happened.

02:02:50.964 --> 02:02:53.066
Maybe he'd even still be alive.

02:02:59.773 --> 02:03:04.578
But don't get it twisted.
I'm not apologizing for any of it.

02:03:04.611 --> 02:03:07.648
If I had it all to do over
again, knowin' what I know,

02:03:07.681 --> 02:03:10.484
I'd do it exactly the same way.

02:03:10.517 --> 02:03:12.886
My past makes me who I am...

02:03:12.919 --> 02:03:16.457
Right or wrong, good or bad.

02:03:16.490 --> 02:03:18.925
