WEBVTT

00:21.187 --> 00:23.390
Yeah!

00:23.490 --> 00:25.825
[whale 2 laughs
and growls] Yeah!

00:32.665 --> 00:35.335
<i>Attention all Atlanteans.</i>

00:35.402 --> 00:39.439
<i>King Aquaman is about
to deliver his royal judgment.</i>

00:39.539 --> 00:42.342
Hm. I see what must be done.

00:42.409 --> 00:44.911
And it is now
time to act!

00:52.619 --> 00:54.120
'Kay, let's see here.

00:54.954 --> 00:56.956
And done!

00:57.057 --> 01:00.293
I finally finished
all the King jobs that
Vulko set out for me.

01:00.393 --> 01:01.528
Not bad, huh?

01:03.863 --> 01:05.565
So, what do you think?

01:05.632 --> 01:09.069
I think someone's doing
a pretty good job as King,
huh? Huh?

01:10.470 --> 01:12.405
Oh, come on!
What do you want from me?

01:12.472 --> 01:13.807
I don't know.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.409
The throne room just
used to be more... exciting.

01:16.476 --> 01:17.977
Exciting?

01:18.078 --> 01:20.747
I just beat up a living island
to reclaim my stolen Trident.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.315
This is
thrilling stuff, people.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.317
Uh, so you say.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.386
I mean, <i>we</i> weren't there.

01:26.453 --> 01:30.390
Okay. But you <i>were</i> here
when I threw the criminal
Ocean Master in jail

01:30.457 --> 01:32.225
after rescuing him from, again,

01:32.292 --> 01:36.296
a horrifying collection
of land, eyeballs and fingers.

01:36.396 --> 01:39.099
Remember Ocean Master?

01:39.165 --> 01:40.600
He was great!

01:40.667 --> 01:42.602
Ocean Master was <i>not</i> great!

01:42.669 --> 01:44.170
He was leading you all to war!

01:44.270 --> 01:46.840
At least he was gonna
take us <i>with</i> him to war.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.576
Some of us
like feeling included.

01:49.642 --> 01:51.678
Um,
he took me to Europe.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.781
You mean when Ocean Master
sent you to kill me and Mera?

01:54.848 --> 01:55.949
Uh, yeah.

01:56.015 --> 01:58.017
But I failed,
so you're welcome.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.686
You keep skipping town down

01:59.786 --> 02:02.122
and leaving us
in the empty throne room
doing nothing.

02:02.188 --> 02:04.424
We spent a whole year here
waiting for you

02:04.491 --> 02:06.759
to get back from
some rescue mission.

02:06.826 --> 02:10.330
I don't have years to spare
because I'm old.

02:14.267 --> 02:15.802
First of all,

02:15.869 --> 02:17.837
why did you spend
the whole year
just standing in here?

02:17.937 --> 02:20.473
You could've gone outside and,
I don't know,
played water polo?

02:20.540 --> 02:23.877
Uh, we just call it polo.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.146
Secondly, you did <i>not</i>
wait for me.

02:26.212 --> 02:28.348
You replaced me
with Ocean Master.

02:28.448 --> 02:31.718
Yeah, remember Ocean Master?

02:31.818 --> 02:36.055
Thirdly, I had to save
our people on Outpost Four
from Pytor Mortikov.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.323
And I did it!

02:37.390 --> 02:38.992
I even made peace
between the Outpost folks

02:39.058 --> 02:41.227
and the bandits that
used to terrorize them.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.196
You mean <i>those</i> bandits?

02:43.296 --> 02:44.130
Huh?

02:45.165 --> 02:46.733
- Yes, those bandits.
- Hey!

02:46.833 --> 02:48.635
They work for me now
as palace guards.

02:48.701 --> 02:52.338
It's just one of
my great new ideas
as a good King.

02:52.405 --> 02:53.840
They used to
rob people for money,

02:53.907 --> 02:56.376
but now I'm paying them
to protect us all.

02:56.476 --> 02:57.644
Yeah, in a way,

02:57.710 --> 02:59.846
it's like
we're robbing you.

02:59.913 --> 03:00.980
No, it's not like that.

03:01.047 --> 03:02.382
That's not what's happening.

03:02.482 --> 03:04.083
Never phrase it that way again.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.019
I'm <i>trying</i> here, people.

03:06.085 --> 03:07.720
What do you want from me?

03:07.820 --> 03:10.557
Want me to kiss
every baby here?
I'll smooch every baby.

03:10.657 --> 03:11.724
You! Give me your baby.

03:11.824 --> 03:13.393
- No!

03:17.263 --> 03:18.865
Ocean Master

03:18.932 --> 03:21.100
has returned to challenge
King Aquaman for the thr--

03:21.201 --> 03:23.203
- Oh, it's just Mera.

03:23.269 --> 03:25.338
<i>Just</i> Mera?
Who said that?

03:26.773 --> 03:28.708
Get back here!

03:28.775 --> 03:31.211
This day
is going well.

03:31.277 --> 03:35.215
<i>♪ Aquaman King of Atlantis ♪</i>

03:35.281 --> 03:37.217
<i>♪ Chapter Three
Tidal Shift ♪</i>

03:37.283 --> 03:38.718
Yo, Mera. What's up?

03:38.785 --> 03:39.919
What's up with <i>me?</i>

03:40.019 --> 03:41.120
What's up with <i>them?</i>

03:41.221 --> 03:42.355
They look miserable.

03:42.422 --> 03:43.456
What'd you do to them?

03:43.556 --> 03:45.892
I guess not... die?

03:45.959 --> 03:47.961
I'm <i>trying</i>
to do a good job

03:48.061 --> 03:50.029
and be the King
that Atlantis deserves.

03:50.096 --> 03:51.965
I don't know what
these people want from me.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.133
I don't think
<i>they</i> even know

03:54.234 --> 03:55.768
what they want from you, man.

03:55.868 --> 03:57.403
But as King, you have to do
what <i>you</i> think is right,

03:57.470 --> 03:59.138
whether or not
people like you for it.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.540
They've never had a King that

04:00.607 --> 04:02.475
actually cared
about them before.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.577
Just be yourself
and they'll come around.

04:04.644 --> 04:06.479
And if they don't,
I'll punch 'em.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.815
I'll punch
every one of 'em.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.752
Yeah. Especially you.

04:12.819 --> 04:14.053
Uh, thanks, Mera.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.755
Oh! What're you doing
with that crystal?

04:15.822 --> 04:18.157
Oh! Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.059
Vulko wants to see us
down in his vault.

04:20.126 --> 04:21.494
Yes! Say no more.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.162
Anywhere but the throne room.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.933
Hmm. Ocean Master would
<i>never</i> leave to go to the vault.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.402
What? This is part
of my job as King.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.271
Do you <i>not</i> want me
to do my job?

04:31.337 --> 04:34.107
- I mean, seriously,
the nerve of these guys.

04:34.173 --> 04:37.343
Ocean Master
would <i>never</i> do his job.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.146
- And that's the problem.

04:40.246 --> 04:43.182
See? This is what I'm saying.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.851
I go off and stop sea criminals

04:44.951 --> 04:47.120
- and the citizens
don't care.

04:47.186 --> 04:50.356
Yeah! What the heck?
They should love that.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.196
Then I spend an actual week
doing King chores for Vulko,

04:57.297 --> 04:58.998
and they don't
like that either.

04:59.098 --> 05:02.802
We should
build a new
waste management facility.

05:02.869 --> 05:04.537
One more
ribbon-cutting ceremony,

05:04.637 --> 05:05.805
and I think
they'll be won over.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.607
We've cut every ribbon.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.876
I'm done cutting ribbons.

05:11.511 --> 05:14.614
What you <i>should</i> be done doing
is hitting that crystal.

05:14.681 --> 05:17.216
Why? It's really good
for relieving my stress.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.885
Well, it's also really good

05:18.985 --> 05:21.554
at maybe ripping
a planet in half
with gravitational energy.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.892
It is?

05:25.992 --> 05:29.062
Well,
then it's a good thing
we've been so safe with it.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.031
That's why I called
you both down here.

05:32.131 --> 05:34.400
I have finally figured out
what these crystals do.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.070
The blue one decelerates time

05:37.170 --> 05:39.739
and the red one
accelerates time.

05:39.839 --> 05:40.840
Yeah, we know that.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.175
But how do they work?

05:42.241 --> 05:43.976
Oh!

05:46.012 --> 05:48.414
Even this is more comfortable
than my throne.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.150
This is my throne now!

05:51.217 --> 05:52.585
Will this turn it on?

05:54.654 --> 05:56.489
No.

05:57.824 --> 05:59.992
The way the crystals
are meant to work

06:00.059 --> 06:01.861
is to be placed in...

06:01.928 --> 06:03.763
the armor of Cronus.

06:07.233 --> 06:08.234
Whoa!

06:08.334 --> 06:09.435
Why was it under that cover?

06:09.535 --> 06:12.071
Uh...
For... for the...

06:12.171 --> 06:13.673
- for the reveal.
- Nice.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.241
- It was good.
- Oh, thanks.

06:15.341 --> 06:17.176
This armor has been
in the palace vault

06:17.243 --> 06:18.878
since it was
discovered by Atlanteans

06:18.945 --> 06:21.614
some millennia ago
in a crashed alien spaceship.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.283
Oh, right.
A ship from "outer space".

06:24.384 --> 06:26.285
That thing that's totally real.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.087
Uh, outer space <i>is</i> real.

06:28.187 --> 06:30.456
I am <i>very</i> happy

06:30.556 --> 06:31.924
that not believing
in outer space

06:32.024 --> 06:33.960
isn't some weird
Atlantean thing.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.028
Just a weird Mera thing.

06:36.095 --> 06:38.297
This woman who
I've chosen to love.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.566
Hey! That's me.

06:40.633 --> 06:43.136
I've known about the armor
of Cronus for years, obviously.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.804
But, I never knew how it worked

06:44.904 --> 06:46.439
because that page in my book

06:46.539 --> 06:48.708
<i>The Tome of Cool Alien Stuff
We Found at Atlantis</i>

06:48.775 --> 06:50.209
was mysteriously torn out.

06:50.276 --> 06:51.644
See? Who does that?

06:51.744 --> 06:53.713
"Cool alien stuff
we found in Atlantis."

06:53.780 --> 06:55.481
Wait! What's the
other stuff in there?

06:55.581 --> 06:57.750
It wasn't until you brought me
these crystals that I realized

06:57.817 --> 06:59.585
they're the final pieces!

07:02.955 --> 07:04.957
Space armor? Time crystals?

07:05.057 --> 07:06.759
That sounds like
a winning combination.

07:06.826 --> 07:08.394
What can this baby do
if we power it up?

07:08.461 --> 07:10.830
Well, at full capacity,
the armor of Cronus

07:10.930 --> 07:14.167
wields the very fabric of time
and space as its weapons.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.103
The Crosmenauts built it
to end an ancient Civil War.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.171
Crosmenauts?

07:18.271 --> 07:19.605
Uh, it's a rough translation.

07:19.672 --> 07:20.840
Their word for themselves
sounds even stupider.

07:20.940 --> 07:21.808
If you say so.

07:21.908 --> 07:23.509
The important thing is

07:23.609 --> 07:25.011
<i>that the armor ripped
their own planet to shreds...</i>

07:26.612 --> 07:29.348
<i>...scattering them and
their history across the stars.</i>

07:29.449 --> 07:32.518
And now,
we have everything we need

07:32.618 --> 07:34.253
to reactivate it right here.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.354
Pretty neat, huh?

07:35.455 --> 07:36.456
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- What?

07:36.522 --> 07:38.291
No! All of this is bad.

07:38.357 --> 07:39.692
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.360
Oh, yeah.
Definitely for sure bad.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.362
Also, that's why I need you two

07:43.463 --> 07:46.365
to take the crystals
far away from the armor.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.867
No! No!

07:47.967 --> 07:50.269
We must keep them
<i>away</i> from each other.

07:50.336 --> 07:53.372
So, you're asking us to disable
a very cool-sounding weapon,

07:53.473 --> 07:55.942
<i>and</i> we have
to do it separately?

07:56.008 --> 07:57.510
I still need
to do more research,

07:57.610 --> 07:59.378
but they're made up of equal
yet opposing forces.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.447
If they come into contact
with each other,

08:01.514 --> 08:04.050
who knows what
the effect could be?

08:04.150 --> 08:05.618
So... no touchy?

08:05.685 --> 08:08.054
Not unless you want
to potentially blow stuff up,

08:08.154 --> 08:11.390
which is definitely
something that could happen.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.626
But, if you do wanna
blow something up,
let's try it.

08:14.894 --> 08:16.062
No, no, no, no, no.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.730
Oh, right.
Absolutely right.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.165
Yeah. Me neither.
No, no, no, no.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.300
We agree. Scatter the pieces
for sure. Mm-hmm.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.637
- Mm-hmm.

08:26.038 --> 08:27.240
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.544
Say...

08:31.644 --> 08:35.147
it's too bad these things
are so dang dangerous,
though, huh?

08:35.214 --> 08:36.716
Obviously, no one can keep it.

08:36.816 --> 08:38.251
Yep. Obviously.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.254
I mean, uh, I get it.
Just too dangerous.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.588
Uh-huh.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.191
But, if one
<i>could</i> keep it, and...

08:45.258 --> 08:47.193
I kept it,
hypothetically, of course,

08:47.260 --> 08:49.929
and I had a giant suit
of alien time armor,

08:50.029 --> 08:52.098
again, hypothetically,
obviously,

08:52.198 --> 08:56.869
the Atlanteans might actually
think I was a pretty cool King.

08:58.938 --> 09:01.440
He's feeling insecure about
how much the Atlanteans
don't respect him.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.876
Oh, hey,
don't you worry about them.

09:03.943 --> 09:05.177
You're Aquaman!

09:05.244 --> 09:07.013
The Atlantean from
the surface world.

09:07.079 --> 09:09.682
You have a way
of bringing things together.

09:09.749 --> 09:11.684
Thanks, Vulko.
I needed that.

09:13.352 --> 09:16.956
Again,
do not bring them together.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.391
- Sorry.
- Oh, yeah. Whoops!

09:18.457 --> 09:20.293
Luckily, I'm not doing
anything else today,

09:20.393 --> 09:22.061
so I'm ready
for a good mission.

09:22.128 --> 09:25.197
I don't
wanna smooch that
weird-looking baby anyways.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.633
<i>-Wait, was</i> that a baby?

09:31.070 --> 09:32.204
Nice one, Topo.

09:34.874 --> 09:36.475
Guard the crystals
while we check out

09:36.576 --> 09:38.444
whatever is causing the alarm.

09:38.544 --> 09:40.780
And keep them
apart from each other.

09:44.817 --> 09:47.420
The Royal Sea Jail
has been breached.

09:47.486 --> 09:49.922
Jailbreak! Jailbreak!
Jailbreak!

09:49.989 --> 09:52.825
- Did he just say jail--

09:56.562 --> 09:59.231
Time to be naughty!

09:59.298 --> 10:01.667
Oh, no, you don't,
Naughty Johnny!

10:04.937 --> 10:06.305
Thank you!

10:07.273 --> 10:08.307
Oh, right.

10:08.407 --> 10:10.509
They <i>want</i> to leave. Fish guts!

10:19.352 --> 10:22.254
I have
a new King job for you.

10:22.321 --> 10:24.523
Yeah, okay.
I get it, Vulko.

10:29.495 --> 10:30.830
Who are all these dude?

10:30.930 --> 10:31.864
And dudettes.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.332
Women can commit crime too.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.502
You got that right.

10:36.602 --> 10:37.970
Finally, some recognition.

10:38.037 --> 10:40.373
Okay. Who are
all these <i>people?</i>

10:40.473 --> 10:42.174
These are
the toughest, meanest,

10:42.274 --> 10:43.476
most dastardly groups

10:43.542 --> 10:45.277
who have
ever attacked Atlantis.

10:45.344 --> 10:47.313
The...are free!

10:52.885 --> 10:55.855
You're getting it all spitty.

10:55.955 --> 10:58.057
And the fire trolls!

11:00.026 --> 11:01.394
Mama Mia!

11:07.500 --> 11:09.735
And the Mirror Men!

11:09.835 --> 11:11.070
And Mirror Women.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.239
Yep. Got it.
Women can be criminals.

11:15.908 --> 11:18.911
Oh. I don't hate this.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.317
We'll have to split up
and reel 'em in.

11:25.384 --> 11:27.219
Yeah! Let's get 'em!

11:29.055 --> 11:31.257
Hey, you Crustoloids. Eat this!

11:36.062 --> 11:37.430
Dropping him, Crusty!

11:39.198 --> 11:41.200
- I said...

11:42.768 --> 11:44.370
Hah! Gotcha!

11:44.437 --> 11:45.838
Oh, gross! What?

11:50.109 --> 11:51.844
Oh, man!

11:55.214 --> 11:57.850
Uh,
maybe we can just...

11:57.917 --> 11:59.118
talk this out?

12:01.220 --> 12:04.223
How are you
even doing this underwater?

12:04.290 --> 12:07.860
This is harder
than midday in Italia.

12:07.927 --> 12:10.296
Did I tell you
that Ocean Master
took me to Europe?

12:10.396 --> 12:11.464
It's no big deal.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.936
Huh? Oh.

12:17.036 --> 12:18.204
Get outta here.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.272
- Alright.
- Okay. I had it under control.

12:20.372 --> 12:21.874
Fire trolls, huh?

12:21.941 --> 12:25.144
Well, I've been known to get
a little hot-headed, myself.

12:33.552 --> 12:34.487
Woah!

12:35.387 --> 12:36.555
Ow! Ow!

12:36.622 --> 12:38.958
I didn't mean
hot-headed literally.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.997
Looking at myself this long

12:45.097 --> 12:48.601
has only shown me
how empty I truly am inside.

12:48.667 --> 12:51.637
Pick on someone with your own
self-destructive narcissism.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.473
Woah!

13:08.521 --> 13:10.689
I got you now! What?

13:11.957 --> 13:13.192
Ow!

13:22.301 --> 13:24.270
This is
what you look like.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.181
Now what do we do?

13:35.281 --> 13:37.283
Call in reinforcements.

13:42.188 --> 13:43.222
Huh?

13:48.194 --> 13:51.130
They schooled you!

13:57.536 --> 13:58.671
Huh?

14:26.599 --> 14:28.033
Now who's in hot water?

14:28.100 --> 14:30.035
I got puns for days.

14:30.102 --> 14:32.771
These crystal jerks
won't give up.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.440
Ugh! Can we just be done

14:34.540 --> 14:36.609
so I can go back
to my magic books?

14:36.709 --> 14:38.277
That's it!

14:38.377 --> 14:40.746
Magic books are magic.

14:45.284 --> 14:47.686
And some magic is lazers.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.192
Well, I'm glad that's over.

14:53.259 --> 14:55.094
Let's go back to the palace.

14:57.062 --> 14:57.963
Oh, great.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.365
It's my royal guard.

14:59.431 --> 15:00.966
Have you been here
the whole time?

15:01.066 --> 15:02.902
I don't know if you heard
the blaring alarm,

15:02.968 --> 15:04.970
but we could've used
your help on that jailbreak.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.039
What? You told us
to guard the throne room,

15:07.106 --> 15:08.240
so we did.

15:08.307 --> 15:10.075
It does look
convict-free in here.

15:10.142 --> 15:12.211
Yeah. I mean, it <i>is</i> good

15:12.278 --> 15:15.281
that no sea criminals
got into the throne room.

15:15.381 --> 15:17.149
Right. Except for
the one sea criminal

15:17.249 --> 15:18.918
that <i>did</i> get
into the throne room,

15:18.984 --> 15:21.620
uh, and is still hiding
behind the throne.

15:21.720 --> 15:22.788
What?

15:22.888 --> 15:25.491
Oh. Uh...
Fools!

15:25.591 --> 15:28.794
This whole jailbreak
was just a distraction

15:28.894 --> 15:31.563
caused by me, Ocean Master.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.732
It was my plan all along

15:33.799 --> 15:35.801
for you to find me.

15:35.901 --> 15:38.604
Yeah. This old guy showed up
right after the jailbreak

15:38.671 --> 15:40.339
started sitting on the throne.
Who knew?

15:40.439 --> 15:42.841
You didn't tell us <i>not</i> to let
anyone sit on the throne.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.645
And he's so old,
we figured what's the harm,
you know?

15:46.745 --> 15:48.013
How do I say this?

15:48.113 --> 15:51.350
The harm is that
he's always trying to kill me.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.519
- Well, he didn't, did he?

15:53.619 --> 15:55.154
He heard you come in and hid.

15:55.254 --> 15:57.623
Yeah. And he told us not to
tell you where he was hiding

15:57.690 --> 15:59.091
because he specifically said

15:59.158 --> 16:01.827
it was not part of his plan
to be found. Yeah.

16:01.927 --> 16:03.796
You guys really
make me question

16:03.862 --> 16:05.631
my decision to hire bandits.

16:05.698 --> 16:06.966
Meh. Whatever.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.001
At least Ocean Master's
<i>very</i> dumb plan

16:09.101 --> 16:10.035
has failed again.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.603
My back!

16:11.670 --> 16:14.106
No,
you don't even <i>know</i> my plan.

16:14.173 --> 16:17.509
You just told us
you caused the jailbreak.

16:17.609 --> 16:20.112
Okay. Yeah, well...

16:20.179 --> 16:24.116
but do you know that
I've got an accomplice?

16:24.183 --> 16:26.685
- What?

16:26.785 --> 16:29.388
Aquaman, you were
the fool that placed

16:29.488 --> 16:32.624
two cunning geniuses
in a cell together.

16:32.691 --> 16:35.961
<i>Me and Pytor Mortikov.</i>

16:37.196 --> 16:38.697
Oh, Ocean Master,

16:38.797 --> 16:43.302
I senses that you are
cunning genius like myself.

16:43.369 --> 16:46.405
Uh, do you want
to be best friendses?

16:46.505 --> 16:49.742
<i>At first,
we just focused on
entertaining ourselves</i>

16:49.842 --> 16:52.144
<i>to keep our minds witty sharp.</i>

16:52.211 --> 16:54.580
<i>-But then, we realized common</i>

16:54.680 --> 16:57.149
<i>than just perfect
singing voices.</i>

16:57.216 --> 16:59.918
Ooh, I hates the Aquaman.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.087
He is a big beardy baby.

17:02.187 --> 17:05.524
Ocean Master,
you are true King.

17:05.591 --> 17:09.094
I also hate Aquaman
and think I should be King.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.529
<i>And since we were best friends,</i>

17:10.596 --> 17:12.731
<i>I promised to
create the jailbreak</i>

17:12.831 --> 17:14.099
<i>as a distraction,</i>

17:14.199 --> 17:15.434
<i>so no one would notice</i>

17:15.534 --> 17:17.703
<i>that Mortikov had snuck off.</i>

17:17.770 --> 17:19.905
Please, Ocean Master,

17:20.005 --> 17:23.275
you are the only genius
I can trust.

17:24.943 --> 17:26.178
<i>The jail
was built when I was King,</i>

17:26.245 --> 17:27.613
<i>so I know all of the secrets.</i>

17:27.713 --> 17:30.416
<i>Like the hidden button
inside the cell</i>

17:30.516 --> 17:32.951
<i>that opens the doors.</i>

17:33.052 --> 17:34.953
<i>Why would
the prison have that?</i>

17:35.054 --> 17:36.955
<i>I installed it myself</i>

17:37.056 --> 17:39.024
<i>in case I ever
got thrown in jail.</i>

17:39.091 --> 17:41.393
<i>So, the jailbreak
wasn't to break out of jail?</i>

17:41.460 --> 17:44.563
<i>It was just a distraction?
For what?</i>

17:44.630 --> 17:46.065
Uh, oh, yeah!

17:46.131 --> 17:48.600
I almost forgot.

17:48.700 --> 17:52.137
<i>Mortikov needed time to
sneak down into the vault</i>

17:52.237 --> 17:53.939
<i>so he can get time crystals</i>

17:54.039 --> 17:56.075
<i>and the armor of corn husk.</i>

17:56.141 --> 17:57.609
<i>Uh, Cronus.</i>

17:57.709 --> 17:59.478
<i>What do I care?</i>

17:59.578 --> 18:00.879
<i>-It wasn't about
the crystals for me.</i>

18:00.946 --> 18:03.215
<i>You see, Mortikov, baby,</i>

18:03.282 --> 18:06.085
<i>had an enticing offer.</i>

18:06.151 --> 18:07.953
Once I has the crystalses,

18:08.053 --> 18:10.322
<i>I promise to defeat Aquaman</i>

18:10.422 --> 18:15.327
<i>and make you, Ocean Master,
King once more.</i>

18:16.929 --> 18:19.498
<i>♪ La, la, la, la ♪</i>

18:19.598 --> 18:20.999
And then he went to go do that.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.168
I told you it was a good plan.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.804
Uh, wait.
Mortikov knows about the armor?

18:25.904 --> 18:27.072
Well, that's bad.

18:27.139 --> 18:29.007
Not as bad as
his face will be when I--

18:29.108 --> 18:31.009
Ocean Master,
you dummy!

18:31.110 --> 18:32.444
He's not gonna make you King.

18:32.511 --> 18:35.147
And he might very well
destroy the whole planet!

18:35.247 --> 18:39.151
Um,
and then he'll make me King?

18:39.251 --> 18:43.422
No. I just
started winning over
the citizens of Atlantis.

18:43.489 --> 18:44.623
Well, almost.

18:44.690 --> 18:46.258
And I'm not going
to let you waltz in here

18:46.325 --> 18:47.359
and take that away from me.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.196
We'll deal with you later.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.432
We gotta get down to the vault
and stop Mortikov.

18:59.171 --> 19:00.205
I did it!

19:00.305 --> 19:02.875
Ah, this was a good plan.

19:02.975 --> 19:06.979
Uh, didn't he tell us not to
let anyone sit on the throne?

19:07.045 --> 19:09.047
Uh, not specifically.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.516
Oh! Well, then,

19:10.616 --> 19:12.951
let's just carry on
and keep guarding, peoples.

19:13.018 --> 19:14.853
Animals. Whatever we are.
Who cares?

19:18.824 --> 19:21.160
- Oh, no! Topo!

19:24.196 --> 19:28.500
Welcome, Aquaman and Aquagirl.

19:28.567 --> 19:29.701
Ew, what?

19:29.801 --> 19:32.070
Uh, <i>and</i> Aqua Royal Advisor.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.174
Oh, I must thank you
for finding red crystal.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.576
I have been searching
for many years,

19:37.676 --> 19:40.179
but you brought it right to me.

19:40.245 --> 19:42.047
That wasn't on purpose
and you know it!

19:42.147 --> 19:44.883
I had found
blue crystal long ago,

19:44.983 --> 19:47.186
but had no idea where red one

19:47.252 --> 19:49.721
<i>or</i> armor of Cronus was.

19:49.821 --> 19:51.557
Yes, yes, yes.

19:51.657 --> 19:53.592
I know all about armor.

19:53.692 --> 19:57.429
This is thanks to
a salvaging mission
where I found this.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.399
The missing page
of my book!

20:01.667 --> 20:03.268
Do you have rest
of cool alien stuff

20:03.368 --> 20:04.937
we found in Atlantis?

20:05.037 --> 20:07.940
Mm. I would very much
like to borrow it.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.875
Sounds very cool!

20:09.942 --> 20:13.178
But I will have
all the time in world, soon.

20:13.245 --> 20:15.948
Because now
I will put crystals into armor,

20:16.048 --> 20:17.583
put armor onto me,

20:17.683 --> 20:21.019
and finally become King of
this trash pile called Earth.

20:21.086 --> 20:24.189
You're gonna be King of getting
the blue fin slaps out of you.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.726
Vulko, move!
We need to grab him.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.294
Uh, no need.

20:29.394 --> 20:32.464
You see, if Mortikov here
had read the <i>whole</i> book...

20:32.564 --> 20:34.800
Ooh! Which I would like to do.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.803
...he would know
that the Crosmenauts

20:37.903 --> 20:39.972
were little
octopus-like aliens.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.040
They were basically the size
of a surface pumpkin,

20:42.107 --> 20:45.310
and the armor was built
for their bodies to pilot.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.579
Meanwhile, Mortikov
is a big man,

20:47.646 --> 20:50.482
so there's no way
he could fit into the armor.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.817
What a dummy, huh?

20:51.917 --> 20:53.785
What a complete buffoon!

21:03.262 --> 21:04.730
Oopsie-doopsie!

21:04.796 --> 21:06.898
Looks like I already knew this

21:06.965 --> 21:08.634
and modified my own body.

21:08.734 --> 21:13.438
Turns out, I'm pretty
smart guy indeed.

21:13.505 --> 21:16.475
You were a cyborg
this whole time?

21:16.575 --> 21:19.911
Actually, that does explain
how he was breathing underwater

21:19.978 --> 21:21.813
without me creating
an air bubble for him.

21:21.913 --> 21:24.082
I noticed a few minutes ago,
but I didn't say anything

21:24.149 --> 21:26.285
because I assumed
we all wanted him to drown.

21:26.351 --> 21:29.154
Yeah, yeah.
ust got to get the crystals in.

21:29.254 --> 21:31.290
There we go!

21:31.356 --> 21:32.791
- Dang it! We gotta grab him!
- Shoot!

21:32.858 --> 21:35.260
Yeah, let's kick
his non-existent butt!

21:35.327 --> 21:36.962
Agreed. Let's beat up Mortikov

21:37.029 --> 21:39.264
before he figures out
how to use the armor.

21:39.331 --> 21:44.202
Oh, I am not
Pytor Mortikov anymore.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.706
Yeah.
No kidding, you creep.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.776
Get out of here,
useless old body. Shoo!

21:50.842 --> 21:52.878
This armor completes journey

21:52.978 --> 21:56.481
I started all those years ago
in garbage dump.

21:56.548 --> 21:58.550
My mother and I were outcasts,

21:58.650 --> 22:00.385
banished to the wasteland.

22:00.485 --> 22:03.555
Now, I made wasteland
of all land.

22:03.655 --> 22:06.058
If I am only allowed to
be King of the garbage,

22:06.158 --> 22:08.794
then I will turn
whole world into trash pile

22:08.860 --> 22:11.229
and rebuild in my own image.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.066
The survivors may
be my subjects.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.901
They call me...

22:16.001 --> 22:18.170
Scavenger!

22:18.236 --> 22:20.639
Okay. So,
let's beat up <i>Scavenger</i>

22:20.706 --> 22:22.841
before he figures out
how to use the armor.

22:24.142 --> 22:25.577
Just you try.

22:29.314 --> 22:30.849
Come on, come on, come on!

22:30.916 --> 22:32.984
Activate the crystals!

22:37.889 --> 22:39.424
Crystals, go!

22:39.524 --> 22:42.394
It really feels like
finger guns should work, no?

22:50.769 --> 22:52.504
Nice try, Aquastinko!

22:57.008 --> 22:58.410
Maybe secret button.

23:00.946 --> 23:03.215
Oh, no! Not the statue
of Poseidon Jr.!

23:03.281 --> 23:04.516
I got you, boy.

23:04.583 --> 23:06.518
Woah!

23:09.388 --> 23:11.356
Oh, no, no, no, no!

23:13.258 --> 23:15.060
Vulko,
what are you doing?

23:15.127 --> 23:18.130
Leave your dumb trinkets
and help us!

23:18.230 --> 23:19.131
Trinkets?

23:19.231 --> 23:20.198
- Vulko!
- Oh, come on!

23:20.265 --> 23:21.700
Huh? Right.

23:24.770 --> 23:26.605
Spinny time!

23:26.705 --> 23:27.773
Whee!

23:29.374 --> 23:31.076
The body of Perseus!

23:31.143 --> 23:32.811
Why is it all horses, Vulko?

23:32.911 --> 23:36.782
Time to die!

23:36.882 --> 23:38.583
Huh? No, wait.

23:38.650 --> 23:39.885
Okay, hold on.

23:39.951 --> 23:42.487
Okay, okay. Now, is time to--

23:42.587 --> 23:44.890
Huh?
Mortikov!

23:44.956 --> 23:47.392
Come out of that suit
and face us like a man!

23:47.459 --> 23:49.261
Spider. Nightmare.

23:49.327 --> 23:51.430
It is Scavenger!

23:51.496 --> 23:54.633
Scavenge this!

23:55.767 --> 23:56.668
Quit it!

24:01.239 --> 24:02.407
Okay, okay.

24:02.474 --> 24:04.643
Instructions for
crystal powers.

24:04.743 --> 24:06.178
Let's see here.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.078
Ah!

24:10.849 --> 24:14.152
Now, is time to die!

24:16.154 --> 24:17.522
- There's no way!

24:17.622 --> 24:21.193
You cannot possibly
keep up with me.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.505
Oh, huzzah!

24:33.605 --> 24:35.340
You're free, Topo! Attack!

24:39.511 --> 24:42.113
I would like to
see you try, Cephalopod.

24:44.049 --> 24:47.185
Even Topo
can't fight him.

24:47.285 --> 24:50.121
No one but you
was surprised by that.

24:52.858 --> 24:55.227
Take this!

24:58.163 --> 24:59.631
Too slow, Aquagirl.

24:59.698 --> 25:01.700
First of all,
I'll be <i>Aquawoman.</i>

25:01.800 --> 25:03.335
Second of all, it's neither!

25:03.401 --> 25:04.636
Now, release me or die!

25:04.703 --> 25:06.671
Okay.

25:09.641 --> 25:12.377
Using this suit,

25:12.477 --> 25:16.081
it feels like riding
trash bike from childhood.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.816
Ride this, you big jerk!

25:19.017 --> 25:20.685
Aw, crud!

25:21.720 --> 25:24.923
No! Ride <i>this!</i>

25:25.023 --> 25:29.261
Why does this,
specifically, keep happening?

25:29.361 --> 25:31.096
Oh! Sorry, sorry, sorry!

25:33.899 --> 25:35.267
They need my help!

25:35.367 --> 25:37.235
Time to unleash
my ultimate move.

25:37.335 --> 25:38.770
The Vulko--

25:38.870 --> 25:40.872
What? Wait a minute!

25:48.380 --> 25:51.583
The crystals manipulate time
y manipulating gravity.

25:51.683 --> 25:54.219
Mortikov, the more
you use the crystals,

25:54.286 --> 25:56.454
the more gravitational force
you're emitting.

25:56.555 --> 25:57.889
If you don't stop,

25:57.956 --> 25:59.958
the energy could
destroy us all!

26:01.726 --> 26:03.194
This sounds like something

26:03.261 --> 26:05.764
someone losing side would say.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.803
We gotta get out of here!

26:26.918 --> 26:29.054
No!

26:29.120 --> 26:31.656
My one great love!

26:43.969 --> 26:45.337
What's going on?

26:47.405 --> 26:50.308
I will turn
your city into trash,

26:50.408 --> 26:52.344
and then it will
be my treasure.

26:52.444 --> 26:56.681
Thank you for letting me
know about the
gravitational fields.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.516
- Hey, no problem.
Vulko!

26:58.617 --> 27:02.120
That will make this
much easier.

27:12.097 --> 27:13.932
I <i>really</i> hate this dude.

27:21.873 --> 27:23.608
Now, kiss! Gross!

27:23.675 --> 27:27.545
Uh, I know Aquaman
didn't specifically say

27:27.646 --> 27:28.713
we should defend the city,

27:28.813 --> 27:30.649
but I feel like it's implied

27:30.715 --> 27:33.385
in our title as Royal Guards,
you know,

27:33.485 --> 27:34.653
Hey, you're right!

27:34.719 --> 27:37.222
If Aquaman loses,
he won't pay us anymore.

27:37.322 --> 27:38.690
We've got to get out there.

27:41.559 --> 27:42.727
Uh-oh.

27:48.166 --> 27:52.504
I... I may have
messed up a little.

28:03.415 --> 28:04.849
No! The Atlanteans!

28:08.687 --> 28:12.257
I can't believe it.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.492
That was our favorite statue!

28:14.559 --> 28:16.528
This is all Aquaman's fault!

28:16.594 --> 28:17.929
Ocean Master would never--

28:18.029 --> 28:19.064
Hey! You know what?

28:19.164 --> 28:20.432
That jerk you love so much

28:20.532 --> 28:22.233
is to blame
for what's happening.

28:22.333 --> 28:24.502
Is this the kind
of excitement you wanted?

28:26.838 --> 28:27.706
No.

28:27.772 --> 28:29.174
Should I just leave you here

28:29.240 --> 28:32.610
with your awesome,
new, exciting trash palace?

28:40.719 --> 28:43.288
Now we can't even
see the fight good.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.023
Ungrateful little--

28:45.090 --> 28:46.925
Mera, appreciate
what you're trying to do,

28:47.025 --> 28:48.460
but you were right before.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.095
I can't worry what
the people think of me

28:50.195 --> 28:51.696
or what they say they want.

28:51.763 --> 28:53.031
I'm their King.

28:53.098 --> 28:54.632
And that means
I have to do what's needed.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.302
And what's needed
is a serious bumper woman.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.237
Yeah! Now, how do we stop him?

28:59.304 --> 29:01.272
I don't know,
but we have to try.

29:01.372 --> 29:02.307
Are you sure?

29:02.407 --> 29:03.942
I'm still Princess of Xebel.

29:04.042 --> 29:05.977
We could just call this a loss
and go rule over there.

29:07.879 --> 29:10.548
Yeah, I know.
You're right.
We have to try.

29:10.615 --> 29:12.650
What exactly
do you do in Xebel?

29:12.751 --> 29:17.489
How about you stick to advising
the Atlantean throne,
Vulko!

29:31.603 --> 29:34.172
Scavenger, I won't let you
destroy this city.

29:34.272 --> 29:37.308
Aw, what is point, Aquaman?

29:37.408 --> 29:39.344
Just let me have Atlantis.

29:39.444 --> 29:43.481
The Ocean Master tells me
you were not such a good King.

29:43.581 --> 29:46.117
He obviously
has a biased opinion.

29:46.184 --> 29:49.187
And we won't stop until
your head is back on your body

29:49.287 --> 29:50.922
and your body is in jail.

29:50.989 --> 29:53.958
You can try
to fight the inevitable,

29:54.025 --> 29:58.163
but time is not
on your side!

29:58.263 --> 30:00.265
They always
have to pun, don't they?

30:00.331 --> 30:03.301
Yes. It's like clockwork.

30:03.368 --> 30:05.937
That was a
time pun, too.

30:24.889 --> 30:26.825
He went over here!

30:26.891 --> 30:28.560
- This way!
- No! This way.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.695
Oopsies!

30:31.663 --> 30:33.131
Over here.

30:33.198 --> 30:36.401
Okay. I won't...

30:36.501 --> 30:38.903
Just kidding! Eat building.

30:43.341 --> 30:44.876
- Oh, boy!

30:52.517 --> 30:57.255
Give up,
little water babies.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.824
Accept me
as your trash overlord

30:59.891 --> 31:04.095
and I promise you
a prison room with a view.

31:05.897 --> 31:08.733
Very well.
I crush you.

31:17.275 --> 31:19.544
I squeeze you. Huh?

31:24.349 --> 31:26.217
- Uh-oh!

31:26.284 --> 31:28.419
Civilians, why are
you still here?

31:28.519 --> 31:30.355
Piggyback ride. Here we go!

31:31.890 --> 31:34.692
Yay!
They're saving us.

31:34.759 --> 31:35.760
This way!

31:36.728 --> 31:38.296
So close!

31:38.396 --> 31:39.764
No escape!

31:43.568 --> 31:45.803
All you have done
is ensure they survive

31:45.904 --> 31:50.308
to be ruled over
by little old me.

31:50.408 --> 31:51.943
Hey, Mera!
Huh?

31:52.043 --> 31:53.711
Need a little... kelp?

31:55.813 --> 31:57.315
Now, Aquaman!

32:04.055 --> 32:08.126
Woah! I hate...

32:10.929 --> 32:11.763
Gotcha!

32:13.765 --> 32:14.832
Uh-oh!

32:22.006 --> 32:25.343
Wow! They're really getting
their snot kicked out of them.

32:30.782 --> 32:33.284
I don't think Ocean Master
would fight for us like this.

32:33.351 --> 32:35.687
He wouldn't even split
the check on a Capponadda.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.288
Come on! We got to help them.

32:40.258 --> 32:41.359
Uh-oh.

32:44.996 --> 32:46.364
Let's get him, buddies.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.533
This one's for Techno.

32:48.633 --> 32:51.970
Looks like
you've outsmarted me!

32:52.036 --> 32:53.037
My Royal Guard!

32:53.137 --> 32:54.872
You came to defend me.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.375
- Um, I think they're just
trying to steal those crystals.
- Huh?

32:57.475 --> 32:59.711
Give us these crystals
so we can sell 'em.

32:59.811 --> 33:03.114
Sure. I mean, maybe,
but it's getting the job done.

33:12.223 --> 33:15.793
Okay. I'm not one 100% sure
that outer space exists...

33:15.860 --> 33:16.794
It does!

33:16.861 --> 33:17.895
...but if it <i>is</i> real,

33:17.996 --> 33:19.831
I'm gonna send Scavenger there!

33:23.701 --> 33:25.503
Oh, boy!

33:25.570 --> 33:28.539
I'm going up
very quickly!

33:33.544 --> 33:35.179
What a beautiful day.

33:35.246 --> 33:36.180
Wait, what?

33:41.686 --> 33:44.555
Not cool, you guys.

33:52.096 --> 33:56.334
Oh! Actually,
this is quite beautiful.

33:56.401 --> 34:00.905
But I think it is time to
turn up the heat.

34:05.276 --> 34:06.778
Turnin' up the heat, huh?

34:06.878 --> 34:08.880
Getting warmer.

34:10.548 --> 34:12.750
Wow, this is very impressive!

34:12.850 --> 34:14.786
You think you can send us
to the moon after this?

34:16.387 --> 34:17.688
Never mind.
Just keep going.

34:17.755 --> 34:20.024
Uh, actually,
consider stopping.

34:20.091 --> 34:22.460
What? No!
I've got him on the ropes.

34:24.862 --> 34:27.131
Woah, woah, woah!

34:27.231 --> 34:30.368
Okay. We'll see
how you like <i>this!</i>

34:34.072 --> 34:35.640
That looks bad.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.208
It's probably fine.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.477
It's not like
the Earth's crust itself
is breaking.

34:41.312 --> 34:42.447
Uh, it is.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.215
Okay, this is very bad.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.824
Scavenger is pushing the
gravitational force too far!

34:52.924 --> 34:54.392
Mera, you've got to chill!

34:54.459 --> 34:57.995
Atlantis-- No, the world,
can't take much more of this.

35:06.304 --> 35:08.272
Fine. I'll be less cool.

35:22.186 --> 35:23.488
Man!

35:23.588 --> 35:25.690
Glad that stopped
before things got worse.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.369
Scavenger, you've got to stop!

35:38.469 --> 35:39.871
You'll tear the Earth in two!

35:39.971 --> 35:42.874
All the better.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.543
I will rule over the halves.

36:00.691 --> 36:02.960
Aw, isn't that cute?

36:03.027 --> 36:06.564
Little Aquaman trying
to keep it together.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.800
I will enjoy watching you try.

36:19.343 --> 36:20.978
Everything's fine!

36:21.045 --> 36:23.481
Oh, no! Everything's terrible!

36:31.322 --> 36:32.990
We're doomed!

36:33.057 --> 36:35.226
There's no way Aquaman
could be strong enough

36:35.326 --> 36:37.028
to hold the planet together.

36:39.363 --> 36:40.698
Don't listen to him, babe.

36:40.765 --> 36:41.766
You got this!

36:46.504 --> 36:48.940
Oh, I don't think
he's got this.

36:50.074 --> 36:51.776
Maybe not, alone.

37:02.453 --> 37:03.287
Huh?

37:07.959 --> 37:09.627
Huh? Oh.

37:21.138 --> 37:22.373
It worked!

37:22.440 --> 37:23.975
Okay, brothers and sisters,

37:24.075 --> 37:26.477
your ocean needs you.

37:26.577 --> 37:27.979
Also, my bones.

37:47.999 --> 37:50.101
It's holding!

37:51.836 --> 37:52.837
Wow!

37:52.937 --> 37:54.639
As they say in Italia...

37:59.744 --> 38:02.346
He's holding
the actual planet together.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.649
That's pretty impressive.

38:07.585 --> 38:10.021
No!
Is not impressive.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.656
<i>I</i> am impressive.

38:11.756 --> 38:12.990
I broke planet.

38:13.090 --> 38:15.760
<i>I</i> have harnessed time itself.

38:18.696 --> 38:22.500
Wow! That makes him
look even cooler!

38:22.600 --> 38:25.002
Stupid fish people.

38:25.102 --> 38:26.304
Huh? Oh!

38:26.370 --> 38:28.806
Look what we have here.

38:28.873 --> 38:30.474
I know rules.

38:30.541 --> 38:32.343
I defeated King.

38:33.678 --> 38:35.379
So, now Scavenger

38:35.479 --> 38:38.983
is King of Atlantis.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.786
I haven't lost yet.

38:43.287 --> 38:48.059
But you are going
to lose now!

38:48.159 --> 38:50.127
Aquaman!
Don't worry, babe, I...

38:52.029 --> 38:53.898
Never mind. You're on your own.

38:53.998 --> 38:57.068
What's this, Aquaman?

38:57.168 --> 38:59.970
You won't even defend yourself?

39:00.037 --> 39:02.073
You know I can't,
you leg-headed creep!

39:02.173 --> 39:03.841
Aw, is that so?

39:03.908 --> 39:08.245
Well, then,
so be it!

39:09.347 --> 39:10.648
Okay. What now?

39:13.184 --> 39:15.219
Woah!

39:15.319 --> 39:17.688
King Aquaman is great
and should stay King.

39:17.755 --> 39:19.090
Yeah!

39:19.190 --> 39:21.759
He and his pals
have been helping us all day.

39:21.859 --> 39:24.228
They even caught
those jailbreaking criminals.

39:24.328 --> 39:26.764
They sure did.
Caught us real good.

39:26.864 --> 39:30.735
- And, now, they're fighting
to save the whole city.

39:30.835 --> 39:34.772
Also, he's holding
the entire planet together.

39:36.574 --> 39:37.775
Aww, you guys!

39:37.875 --> 39:39.944
My Kingly deeds
have earned your respect?

39:40.044 --> 39:43.381
Also, he can,
for real, talk to fish!

39:43.447 --> 39:44.882
Yeah, he can!

39:44.949 --> 39:47.385
That's actually
the coolest thing by far.

39:47.451 --> 39:48.619
If you think about it.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.455
Uh... Okay.
Well, still. Thanks.

39:53.057 --> 39:56.093
Enough! I am only playing
by <i>your</i> stupid rules.

39:56.193 --> 39:59.764
I'd beat your King,
so <i>I</i> am your King now.

39:59.864 --> 40:00.865
Huh?
- No!

40:00.931 --> 40:02.266
We want <i>him</i> to be King.

40:02.366 --> 40:04.468
No matter
how many fights he loses.

40:04.568 --> 40:06.771
Yeah! No matter
<i>who</i> beats him up.

40:06.871 --> 40:09.874
Even if <i>everyone</i> beats him up.

40:09.940 --> 40:12.743
Yeah! He's our King! Our loser!

40:12.810 --> 40:14.412
Loser King! Loser King!

40:14.478 --> 40:16.981
Wait! Uh, how did get <i>there?</i>

40:17.982 --> 40:20.418
Hands off our Loser King.

40:21.986 --> 40:23.788
Never!

40:27.425 --> 40:31.095
Yeah!
Aquaman <i>is</i> a total weakening.

40:31.162 --> 40:33.464
Super easy to beat at a duel.

40:33.564 --> 40:36.567
- Okay. What are we--
- But he cares about Atlantis.

40:36.634 --> 40:38.669
And that's where my throne is.

40:38.769 --> 40:42.006
Aquaman <i>should</i> be King.

40:44.175 --> 40:48.446
King Aquaman!
King Aquaman! King Aquaman!

40:48.512 --> 40:51.182
<i>Oh, Ocean Master!</i>

40:51.282 --> 40:53.417
Hey, stinky old man.

40:53.484 --> 40:54.618
This is not plan.

40:54.685 --> 40:56.921
I'm supposed to betray <i>you.</i>

40:56.987 --> 40:58.189
Huh? Uh-oh.

41:23.180 --> 41:24.315
What are you doing?

41:26.150 --> 41:27.451
What <i>is</i> he doing?

41:30.988 --> 41:34.024
Hey, buddy. You're not supposed
to make crystals touch.

41:34.124 --> 41:35.793
Something bad will happen.

41:35.860 --> 41:37.695
Your own smart guy said!

41:37.795 --> 41:39.163
- Uh, actually,

41:39.230 --> 41:41.332
we don't know what it would do.

41:42.900 --> 41:45.135
It just as possible,
something good can happen.

41:45.202 --> 41:46.904
Hm. Smash 'em!

42:05.689 --> 42:08.826
Why are you doing this?

42:08.893 --> 42:10.694
You know what
they say about me.

42:12.196 --> 42:14.265
I'm good at bring stuff...

42:14.365 --> 42:16.200
together!

42:44.862 --> 42:49.533
Wow! It's beautif--

42:49.600 --> 42:51.135
Huh?

42:51.235 --> 42:52.770
I look like a dork!

42:53.804 --> 42:54.638
Huh?

42:56.307 --> 42:57.074
Huh.

43:17.595 --> 43:20.798
Hey, guys. We...
saved Atlantis, right?

43:20.898 --> 43:22.433
We sure did.

43:22.499 --> 43:24.168
Did... Scavenger--

43:24.268 --> 43:25.803
Get crushed inside
the earth itself?

43:25.903 --> 43:27.104
Maybe.

43:27.171 --> 43:30.507
Okay. Then I guess
we did good.

43:30.608 --> 43:34.278
King Aquaman!
King Aquaman! King Aquaman!

43:38.616 --> 43:40.818
It's pretty banged up, up here.

43:40.918 --> 43:42.853
Oh, my throne!

43:50.494 --> 43:53.097
Woah! Twisted. I like it.

43:53.163 --> 43:54.331
King Aquaman,

43:54.431 --> 43:56.533
we made sure
no one wrecked this place

43:56.634 --> 43:58.202
more than it already was.

43:58.302 --> 44:00.938
Yeah. And we didn't let
anyone sit on your throne.

44:01.005 --> 44:04.174
Even though
you didn't say anything
specifically about that.

44:04.274 --> 44:06.110
Thanks, guys.

44:06.176 --> 44:07.344
You did good.

44:09.213 --> 44:11.448
I mean, except for that one guy
we <i>did</i> let sit on the throne.

44:11.515 --> 44:14.218
But, anyway,
please still love me.

44:14.318 --> 44:17.287
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

44:17.354 --> 44:20.324
Hey! I finally feel
like I fit in this thing.

44:20.391 --> 44:23.794
As in, metaphorically,
you feel like a true King?

44:23.861 --> 44:25.162
No. Like, literally.

44:25.229 --> 44:26.897
I don't have a seahorse skull
on my spine.

44:26.997 --> 44:29.133
- Hey, Ocean Master.

44:29.199 --> 44:31.001
I heard what
you said out there.

44:31.068 --> 44:32.569
Thanks for your help.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.538
Even though all of this
was your fault to begin with,

44:34.638 --> 44:37.074
looks like you showed
your true face.

44:40.210 --> 44:41.979
Ah, I meant every word.

44:42.046 --> 44:44.214
I was gonna
get Atlantis destroyed,

44:44.314 --> 44:45.649
but you saved us.

44:45.716 --> 44:47.651
Mom would be proud.

44:47.718 --> 44:50.721
Wow! That...
that means a lot, man. Thanks.

44:50.821 --> 44:53.757
Uh, although,
it feels kinda like

44:53.857 --> 44:55.159
you're hugging the throne

44:55.225 --> 44:57.261
and not... not me.

44:57.361 --> 44:58.429
Ah, so proud of you.

44:58.529 --> 45:00.064
Okay, I'll get you next week

45:00.164 --> 45:01.398
and vengeance will be mine.

45:01.498 --> 45:02.599
What was that?

45:02.700 --> 45:04.902
Nothing.
Love you, bro.

45:05.002 --> 45:09.606
Should... we be throwing him
back in jail or...

45:09.707 --> 45:11.008
Once we repair it, yeah.

45:11.075 --> 45:13.744
For now, I've got someone
keeping an eye on him.

45:17.548 --> 45:18.949
My sweet boy.

45:19.049 --> 45:22.019
Ah, I guess all I had to do
to prove my worth as King

45:22.086 --> 45:24.855
was saved the actual planet
from ripping in half.

45:24.922 --> 45:27.191
No. You were already a King.

45:27.257 --> 45:31.195
Before, in a trials by combat
or sweet, sweet violence.

45:31.261 --> 45:32.930
Now, they see you
for who you are.

45:33.030 --> 45:34.631
A great leader.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.066
And a great smoocher.

45:36.133 --> 45:37.968
Inappropriate.

45:38.068 --> 45:39.937
Huh? All right. Just one.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.141
King Aquaman!
King Aquaman!

45:44.241 --> 45:47.077
Long live King Aquaman!

45:47.144 --> 45:49.213
This'd what I looked like
the whole time.

45:49.279 --> 45:52.649
But the important thing is,
Aquaman!

45:52.750 --> 45:54.151
Speaking of,

45:54.251 --> 45:57.221
I've got a big new list
of King chores for you.

45:57.287 --> 46:00.290
I get it, Vulko!
