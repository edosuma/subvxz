ADDISON: We need to talk, Mitch.

00:20.354 --> 00:23.022
What do you want, Addison?

00:23.024 --> 00:25.157
Don't you get it?

00:25.159 --> 00:26.458
I want you!

00:26.460 --> 00:28.193
The real you,

00:28.195 --> 00:29.561
not the Grinder.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.997
Not this impenetrable god

00:31.999 --> 00:33.565
you need to be
for everyone else.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.467
You.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.202
Little Mitchard,

00:37.204 --> 00:40.472
the passionate wunderkind
I met in law school.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.142
The guy I made love to.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.778
What if I said
I'm not that guy anymore?

00:47.014 --> 00:48.080
What if I said

00:48.082 --> 00:49.815
the Grinder's who I really am?

00:49.817 --> 00:51.583
Who I was meant to be?

00:51.585 --> 00:54.920
You think it was Mitchard
who made love to you that night?

00:55.923 --> 00:57.289
Think again.

01:10.538 --> 01:11.804
(turns off TV)

01:14.842 --> 01:16.175
What?

01:16.177 --> 01:17.276
That doesn't move you?

01:18.612 --> 01:20.245
I mean,
it makes me laugh,

01:20.247 --> 01:22.448
but I don't think that
that's what you were going for.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.349
Well, this is
a huge moment,

01:24.351 --> 01:26.051
not just for
Mitch and Addison,

01:26.053 --> 01:27.086
but for the whole
arc of the series.

01:27.088 --> 01:28.420
Is it going
over your head?

01:28.422 --> 01:29.922
Yeah, maybe it is.

01:29.924 --> 01:33.192
I'm sorry, I gotta
get back to work.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.527
Workplace love interest?

01:35.529 --> 01:37.362
Check.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.104
Ethan. Coffee? No.

01:45.106 --> 01:47.272
Well, Dad, I have
an oral report today.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.308
I have to be "on."
Do it
without coffee.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.243
DEBBIE: You guys,
listen to this.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.544
I was outside
getting the newspaper

01:52.546 --> 01:53.879
and guess who jogged by?

01:53.881 --> 01:55.080
Lyle and Vanessa Gerhart.

01:55.082 --> 01:56.715
The Gerharts?
Yeah.

01:56.717 --> 01:57.983
As in, the Gerhart Center
for the Performing Arts?

01:57.985 --> 01:59.718
Yes.
Oh, I like them.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.153
What are they doing jogging
in this neighborhood?

02:01.155 --> 02:02.454
Don't they live up on, um,
on Mountain Crest?

02:02.456 --> 02:04.089
Yeah, they're training
for a marathon,

02:04.091 --> 02:06.458
and we really hit it off,
so they suggested

02:06.460 --> 02:09.161
that we have dinner here
on Thursday night.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.929
They suggested
we have dinner here?

02:10.931 --> 02:11.663
Yeah.
<i> They</i> did?

02:11.665 --> 02:13.298
Yeah!
Interesting.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.166
What's this face?

02:14.168 --> 02:15.300
What, this face?
Yeah.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.168
This...

02:16.170 --> 02:17.903
this is the face of a skeptic.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.139
Someone who's been
used his whole life

02:20.141 --> 02:21.406
to try and get close to Dean.

02:21.408 --> 02:24.009
And when I get a whiff of that,
I just, you know, I just...

02:24.011 --> 02:25.010
walk the other way, Deb.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.278
We gotta walk the other way.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.247
Morning, family.
What are we talking about?

02:28.249 --> 02:29.948
Stewart thinks this couple

02:29.950 --> 02:31.817
only wants to be friends
with us to get to you.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.352
I live it every day.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.320
Friendships
you think are genuine

02:35.322 --> 02:37.189
turn out to based
on fraud and personal gain.

02:37.191 --> 02:39.291
<i> La vie du celebrite.</i>

02:39.293 --> 02:41.326
He's blending
lemon juice and water.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.694
LIZZIE: You guys,
don't fight it.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.329
The only reason I made
varsity basketball

02:44.331 --> 02:45.497
is 'cause I told them
Dean would come to games.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.367
That's not true, sweetie.
Come on, Lizzie.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.335
I'm sure that's not the only
reason you made the team.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.203
Yes, it is, I'm awful.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.171
She's pretty bad.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.305
ETHAN:
I'm going to prom

02:53.307 --> 02:54.940
with a senior.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.608
I have no illusions
about what she's after.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.643
DEBBIE:
Okay, first of all,

02:57.645 --> 02:59.011
you're not going to prom
with anyone,

02:59.013 --> 03:00.012
because you are
in middle school.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.346
And second,

03:01.348 --> 03:03.215
I am not as cynical as you.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.716
I think that they might
actually like us

03:04.718 --> 03:06.952
for what we bring to the table.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.720
So I'm having them
over to dinner.
DEAN:
Get 'em over here.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.789
I'll have an answer for you
in five minutes.

03:12.159 --> 03:13.525
Okay. New business.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.395
Our client, Rory Pecor,
has been accused of

03:16.397 --> 03:18.530
beating up a younger kid
on school grounds.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.199
Rory Pecor-- as in
the all-state high school

03:20.201 --> 03:22.968
wrestling champ Rory Pecor?
Yeah. That's him.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.403
Wow.
And he claims
it was self-defense,

03:24.405 --> 03:25.671
but because
he's six-two

03:25.673 --> 03:27.206
and dominant in
a violent sport,

03:27.208 --> 03:28.674
everyone assumes
that he started it.

03:28.676 --> 03:31.476
What kind of god...
makes a world like this?

03:31.478 --> 03:34.079
Okay, you can't say that
every time I describe a case.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.814
Stew, since I'm back
to full time now,

03:35.816 --> 03:37.316
maybe I should take this one.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.750
Uh, I don't know, Dad.
I thought we were

03:38.752 --> 03:40.352
gonna maybe kind of
ease you back into it.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.987
Oh, I like that, too.
Feels like it'd be

03:41.989 --> 03:44.256
a good fit for Claire.
Why don't you take this one?
Great.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.692
Rozz/Landy is my old firm
and I know how they operate.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.493
Uh, one thought.
I love this as well,

03:48.495 --> 03:49.828
but maybe
I should run point.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.363
I'm actually up
in the rotation,

03:51.365 --> 03:53.498
not to mention I watch a lot
of high school wrestling.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.034
That's televised?
I wish. That would
save me some gas money.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.836
Todd, come on. Claire just got
here. Let's give her something.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.705
One could argue that...
Okay, that's it.
Thank you, everybody.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.506
Yes, thank you,
everybody.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.775
Congratulations on
the big case, Counselor.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.410
Well, it's not really
a big case.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.878
It's literally
child's play.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.248
Oh, a schoolyard bully
wrongfully accused?

04:09.250 --> 04:11.283
That's a story that
resonates with people.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.118
We did a big episode
on it, season two.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.453
"Bully Goats Gruff."

04:14.455 --> 04:15.921
Joe Gordon-Levitt
came in, guest starred.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.356
Right before
he popped.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.423
He played Wendell Gruff,

04:18.425 --> 04:19.725
an orphaned kid in a wheelchair

04:19.727 --> 04:21.360
who gets rolled down stairs.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.095
Ouch. Yeah.
So, yeah...

04:23.097 --> 04:24.730
If you want to pick my brain...

04:24.732 --> 04:26.865
Yeah, that could definitely
come in handy, thank you.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.434
Hey, what's her deal?

04:29.436 --> 04:30.869
I know she's not a mole,

04:30.871 --> 04:32.371
but we still don't
like her, right?

04:32.373 --> 04:34.106
I find her fascinating.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.275
But I can see why you
might be threatened.

04:36.277 --> 04:37.276
(laughing):
Well, that's funny,

04:37.278 --> 04:38.644
because I'm not.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.312
But... why would I be?

04:40.314 --> 04:41.913
Because she's a new character.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.383
New characters
always cause a reshuffle.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.717
Like when Ivy Dexter,
the ambitious intern,

04:45.719 --> 04:47.319
joined
Stutz & Grinder.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.454
You remember what happened
to Phil, the chubby associate.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.956
He got written off the show.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.291
He got written
off the show, yeah.
...the show.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.393
But I'm sure you're fine.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.563
Hey. Haven't had a chance
to welcome you yet.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.966
If there's anything
you need, you come to me.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.467
Thank you, Mr. Sanderson.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.403
Well, this might
be a lot to ask,

05:04.405 --> 05:05.671
but I wouldn't
mind an office.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.973
I think I can make that happen.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.508
DEBBIE:
<i> Okay.</i>

05:09.510 --> 05:11.510
So what about this dress
for when the Gerharts

05:11.512 --> 05:13.912
come to dinner
tomorrow night?
It does not matter, honey,

05:13.914 --> 05:15.314
because whatever you wear,
they're gonna tell you

05:15.316 --> 05:16.648
how great you look, because
they want to be nice to you

05:16.650 --> 05:17.716
'cause they want to meet Dean.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.685
So, I've been thinking about

05:19.687 --> 05:22.087
how to handle
this whole Claire thing.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.322
What Claire thing?
Who's Claire?

05:23.324 --> 05:24.656
She's a new attorney I hired.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.924
She has no interest in him

05:25.926 --> 05:27.192
and he's never seen
anything like it.

05:27.194 --> 05:28.694
It's kind of incredible.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.329
I mean, Deb,
you can help me with this.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.664
What does
an authentic woman like?

05:32.666 --> 05:36.301
Well, I... I guess, you know,
someone who's normal.

05:36.303 --> 05:38.603
You know, like a little...
humble, even.

05:38.605 --> 05:41.707
Humble. Right.
Mm-hmm.

05:41.709 --> 05:44.176
Like Mark Harmon in<i> Summer</i>
<i>School,</i> when he had to teach

05:44.178 --> 05:46.511
the remedial English class and
be super nice to all the idiots.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.547
There's got to be
a better example.
Yeah, I-I feel like

05:48.549 --> 05:50.382
I could come up with a few.
That can't be
the reference point.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.583
Humble.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.554
Yeah. Great.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.888
So, uh... I'll tap into that.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.457
Thanks, you guys.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.625
I feel like that really sunk in.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.327
Yeah. Yeah.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.695
Helen, how are you?

06:03.697 --> 06:06.398
Yes, my annual
donation.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.166
(whispering):
I'm so sorry, it just...

06:08.168 --> 06:09.401
Just one second.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.403
Um, how do I make
out the check?

06:11.405 --> 06:12.637
Can I just put "CFTB"?

06:12.639 --> 06:14.740
Or do I have to fully write out

06:14.742 --> 06:16.575
"Church for the Blind"?

06:16.577 --> 06:17.843
Write it out. Great.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.478
No, thank<i> you.</i>

06:19.480 --> 06:21.046
It is so humbling

06:21.048 --> 06:23.048
to be able to help
someone like you.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.416
Say hi to Maggie.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.051
Sorry about that.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.353
(chuckling):
It's so embarrassing.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.355
You called me in here
for something?
I did not.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.491
Huh. I wonder why...

06:32.493 --> 06:35.060
Um, I guess maybe you were
trying to show off

06:35.062 --> 06:36.595
and donate to a fake charity
in front of me?

06:36.597 --> 06:38.830
It's not fake
to those blind people.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.065
Wow.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.566
You really need attention.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.435
Oh, my God, no. Attention?

06:43.437 --> 06:44.236
That's my worst
nightmare.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.237
I mean, why do you think

06:45.239 --> 06:46.438
I always play other people?

06:46.440 --> 06:47.873
Nobody knows.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.541
Claire, can I steal you
for a second?
Sure.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.243
Can we continue
this later?

06:51.245 --> 06:54.946
Or maybe move on
from it forever?

06:56.583 --> 06:59.117
And we do our little dance.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.957
(doorbell rings)
Be nice.
I will try.

07:05.959 --> 07:06.958
(quietly):
Liar.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.059
Hi!

07:08.061 --> 07:09.628
Come on in!

07:09.630 --> 07:10.762
Good to see you.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.830
Hi, cutie.

07:12.866 --> 07:13.799
Stewart! Hey!
Hey, how are you, Kyle?

07:13.801 --> 07:15.467
Long time, pal.
Nice to see you.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.436
Yeah, it's been
a while.
God, you look great.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.471
What have you been doing?
Free weights or cardio?

07:19.473 --> 07:20.772
Oh. Uh...

07:20.774 --> 07:22.607
yeah, I try to mix
in a little bit of both.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.509
When?
Whatever it is, it's working.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.246
Stewart, I don't want
to embarrass you, okay?

07:28.248 --> 07:29.648
But I have to ask.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.551
Were you the one that fought
for that protected left

07:32.553 --> 07:33.819
over on Cedar
and 14th?

07:33.821 --> 07:35.587
You heard about that?
Yeah.

07:35.589 --> 07:38.223
Yeah. I-I, uh...
I drafted the petition.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.559
And then I wrote what turned out
to be the final ordinance.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.494
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.062
I'm sitting across
from the guy

07:44.064 --> 07:45.630
that shaved 20 minutes

07:45.632 --> 07:46.832
off of my commute.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.266
He went on and on
about that left.
I did!

07:48.268 --> 07:49.267
Really?
Yeah.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.502
That's so nice to hear.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.003
You know, you work
on something like that

07:52.005 --> 07:53.839
and then, you know,
you think people don't notice.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.740
Well, I noticed, Stewart.
DEAN:
Hey!

07:55.742 --> 07:57.476
Hey, I'm sorry
to interrupt.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.244
STEWART: Oh, uh, Lyle, Vanessa,
this is my brother Dean.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.846
He just recently
moved back home.

08:00.848 --> 08:01.646
Hey. Good to meet you.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.682
Oh...

08:03.684 --> 08:05.951
Oh... Okay, sorry.
No, no, no.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.285
Dean<i> Sanderson.</i>

08:07.287 --> 08:08.653
You guys are...
Brothers.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.956
Oh...
Got it. Okay,
'cause of the Sanderson.

08:10.958 --> 08:11.756
It's the same last name.

08:11.758 --> 08:12.824
LYLE:
Oh, my gosh.

08:12.826 --> 08:13.825
Sorry, we had... I...

08:13.827 --> 08:15.126
Yeah. No idea.
No idea.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.928
Wow. How-how does
it feel to be back?

08:16.930 --> 08:18.497
It feels right, Lyle.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.632
I mean, there have been
some adjustments...

08:20.634 --> 08:22.267
Going from TV law to actual law
does have its challenges.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.535
DEAN:
No, that was seamless.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.470
It's more just

08:25.472 --> 08:26.671
relationships in the workplace.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.039
One, in particular.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.040
DEBBIE:
Oh. Claire.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.041
Maybe you should show her

08:30.043 --> 08:31.476
how much you care about work

08:31.478 --> 08:32.477
and then you could connect

08:32.479 --> 08:33.512
with her on that level.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.514
Oh. Yeah, no, that's something.

08:35.516 --> 08:36.648
STEWART: Yes, talking
to someone at work

08:36.650 --> 08:38.517
about work is
a-a good place to start.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.684
Anyway...

08:39.686 --> 08:41.486
Lyle, Vanessa,

08:41.488 --> 08:43.321
it's really been a pleasure
meeting you both.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.623
All right. Behave yourselves.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.527
Uh, okay. Stew...

08:48.529 --> 08:49.661
you never mentioned
that your brother

08:49.663 --> 08:51.329
was the freakin'
Grinder.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.697
He's just my brother, to me.

08:52.699 --> 08:53.999
You know, I sometimes forget
that he's famous.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.401
That's so cool.
That's fun.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.502
You know what?
We should...

08:57.504 --> 08:58.703
VANESSA: Yes.
LYLE: Why not?

08:58.705 --> 08:59.704
Hey, I just
thought of something.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.640
We are co-chairing
a fund-raiser

09:01.642 --> 09:03.875
next week at the Windsor,
and it's-it's a great event.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.810
It's very special to us,
it means a lot,

09:05.812 --> 09:07.879
and Stew, there'll be
some heavy hitters there.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.581
Oh, Judge McCan would love him.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.149
Judge McCan's gonna be there?

09:11.151 --> 09:12.417
So I don't know if
you guys are free,

09:12.419 --> 09:13.318
but we would love
for you to join us.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.153
Oh.
Yeah.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.222
Yeah?
Yes. That would
be great, thank you.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.356
We'll do it.
VANESSA:
Oh, my God.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.358
Wait, we should
invite Dean, too.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.560
LYLE: Hon...
VANESSA: Right?

09:21.562 --> 09:22.961
LYLE:
That's a great idea.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.333
A little w--?
Deb, it was so obvious.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.901
I mean, of course
they came over

09:29.903 --> 09:32.337
just so they could invite Dean
to their charity thing.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.339
Like they didn't know we were
brothers. I'm not buying it.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.241
Well, they might not have.
They seemed shocked.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.609
They did seem shocked.
Right?

09:37.611 --> 09:38.843
Genuinely shocked.
Yes.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.412
You guys, who cares?

09:40.414 --> 09:42.213
You finally have cool friends.
Be grateful.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.449
That couple
had no interest in you two.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.451
Thank you.
What?
How could you tell?

09:46.453 --> 09:47.953
I'm finely attuned to the signs.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.788
When I made physical
contact with them,

09:49.790 --> 09:52.691
I could feel their bodies rising
to meet my hands

09:52.693 --> 09:54.426
and they had sort of Donner
Party look in their eyes,

09:54.428 --> 09:56.461
like I was a steak
that they wanted to eat.

09:56.463 --> 09:57.862
I gotta bail.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.230
Wow, this is pretty
early for you.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.932
Well, I have a big day.
I'm taking your advice.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.867
Oh.
I'm gonna
talk to Claire about work.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.269
And I'm gonna let the fact
that she's falling

10:04.271 --> 10:05.770
in love with me be the subtext.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.073
Why don't you just
work on the case

10:08.075 --> 10:09.641
and let the subtext be
that you're...

10:09.643 --> 10:11.376
working on the case?

10:11.378 --> 10:13.144
Deb, explain it to him.
He's not getting it.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.346
Okay.
All right!

10:15.382 --> 10:16.815
Okay, so what are we gonna do

10:16.817 --> 10:18.583
about this charity thing?
I don't know, Deb.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.719
It could be nice
for you to meet a judge.

10:20.721 --> 10:23.622
Maybe we should just go
and keep an open mind?

10:23.624 --> 10:24.889
Just the two of us?

10:24.891 --> 10:26.658
It could be fun.
Okay.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.660
All right. Maybe you're right.
Let's go.
Yeah?

10:28.662 --> 10:29.728
Let's go.
And we'll keep an open mind.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.795
Open mind.

10:31.465 --> 10:34.232
(slurping)

10:34.234 --> 10:36.267
There you are, Todd.
What are you doing?

10:36.269 --> 10:38.903
Nothing. I don't really have
anything to work on.
Great.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.639
I need you for
some heavy lifting...
Oh.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.307
...of all of your stuff
out of your office.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.076
We're gonna put Claire in there
and move you to her cubicle.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.312
What?
Stewart said to do that?

10:47.314 --> 10:48.680
Yeah. Since I'm just getting

10:48.682 --> 10:50.115
my sea legs back,
he's assigned me

10:50.117 --> 10:51.650
to do some office management.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.451
He assigned<i> you</i> that?
You've hardly been around

10:53.453 --> 10:56.021
the last three years. Why didn't
I get that assignment?

10:56.023 --> 10:57.789
The assignment
of downgrading yourself

10:57.791 --> 10:58.790
to a cubicle?

10:58.792 --> 10:59.924
That would be awkward, no?

10:59.926 --> 11:01.459
Yeah.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.528
I guess that would be awkward.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.766
DEAN:
Stapler?

11:09.269 --> 11:10.869
I'll make you a deal.

11:10.871 --> 11:11.936
I'll give you the stapler

11:11.938 --> 11:13.471
if you give me the lowdown

11:13.473 --> 11:15.540
on unreasonable search
and seizures. I understand

11:15.542 --> 11:17.475
that you wrote about it
in your school law review.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.811
That's online, huh?
Stew won't give me

11:19.813 --> 11:22.047
any real work, and I need
a bone to chew on.

11:22.049 --> 11:25.050
So I thought we could talk
shop, you know, over coffee.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.785
You want some work?

11:26.787 --> 11:28.453
Uh, those
are background checks.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.221
I need someone to go
through them and summarize them

11:30.223 --> 11:32.824
for me by tomorrow.
Tomorrow? Uh, here's the thing.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.560
This isn't really where I shine.
Oh, no?

11:35.562 --> 11:37.562
We didn't do a lot of actual
paperwork on the show.

11:37.564 --> 11:40.331
We usually just did an
all-nighter montage and skipped

11:40.333 --> 11:42.233
through the boring stuff
and got right to the juice.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.869
Right. See, this boring stuff
that you want to skip over,

11:44.871 --> 11:46.538
that's my whole life.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.540
I'm just saying,
don't waste me on the details.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.142
Put me out front
and let me grind.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.744
I have no idea what that means.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.379
I just want you to get to know
the real me.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.648
And there is one, right?

11:59.252 --> 12:00.251
Hmm.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.192
Wow. This is nice.
(chuckles)
Yeah. Really nice.

12:07.194 --> 12:10.161
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.363
Oh, my gosh, honey.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.899
DEBBIE:
Is that Congressman Delancey?
And look who he's talking to.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.267
That's Judge McCan.
Oh, that's Judge McCan.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.569
That's Judge McCan!

12:17.571 --> 12:19.337
Oh, I'm supposed to
recognize judges now?

12:19.339 --> 12:20.905
Hey! It's good
STEWART/DEBBIE:
Oh, hi!

12:20.907 --> 12:22.741
to see you guys!
How are you? Nice to see you.

12:22.743 --> 12:23.942
Yeah, so I see
you got some drinks.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.944
Yeah, we did. We did.
Mwah! Mwah!
Good to see you!

12:25.946 --> 12:28.012
Where's Dean?
Good, good. Is he...
is he parking the car?

12:28.014 --> 12:29.748
He doesn't trust Fernando?

12:29.750 --> 12:32.851
Uh, no. Sadly, Dean
couldn't make it tonight.
(chuckles)

12:35.789 --> 12:38.189
Oh. Damn it.
Wow.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.924
Didn't see that coming.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.293
Um...

12:42.295 --> 12:43.428
S-Still cool
that-that we came though.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.429
Right?
We're here.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.297
More than cool.
Yes.

12:46.299 --> 12:47.766
All right, good, yeah.
'Cause we were excited.
Good.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.235
Oh, we're so excited.
I want to meet the judge.

12:50.237 --> 12:51.803
No, I mean, you know, it's...
it is a little bit of a shame,

12:51.805 --> 12:53.972
I guess, you know,
that Dean isn't here.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.306
A big shame.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.609
But I'm-I'm sure
it would have been

12:57.611 --> 13:00.411
an equal shame if Dean was here

13:00.413 --> 13:02.614
and-and we couldn't make it.
Mmm.

13:02.616 --> 13:03.615
I'm sure.
DEBBIE: Unable to...

13:03.617 --> 13:05.617
For us, no question.

13:05.619 --> 13:08.219
Yeah.
But I can't say the same
for Brandon Gibgot.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.321
Who's-who's Brandon Gibgot?

13:10.323 --> 13:12.991
He spends his days
in the children's ward,

13:12.993 --> 13:14.392
you know, fighting for his life.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.394
And he's here tonight
because

13:16.396 --> 13:18.463
he has a dream.
A dream.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.465
To meet The Grinder.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.167
That's his dream?

13:22.169 --> 13:23.768
It's all he talks about.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.470
It's, like, the only thing
that helps.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.173
So that's why
you wanted Dean here.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.174
Of course.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.608
Wait, I'm sorry.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.343
Why did you think we did?

13:34.915 --> 13:37.415
Yeah! Rebound!
Rebound!

13:37.417 --> 13:39.984
Down the court! Down the court!

13:39.986 --> 13:41.419
Pass! Pass!

13:41.421 --> 13:42.187
There we go!
Back to Robinson.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.489
(everyone silences)

13:44.491 --> 13:46.858
TANYA: Oh, my God,

13:46.860 --> 13:48.159
there's your uncle.
Can I meet him now?

13:48.161 --> 13:49.594
Maybe later, babe.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.162
Sanderson,
get in there!

13:51.164 --> 13:53.298
Oh, yeah, Lizzie!

13:53.300 --> 13:54.799
Washington, come out.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.701
Everyone...
move the ball!

13:56.703 --> 14:00.271
Pass the ball!
Just pass-pass the ball!

14:00.273 --> 14:01.840
This is Dean.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.508
Dean, hi, where are you?

14:03.510 --> 14:05.376
I am
at Lizzie's basketball game.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.846
She is truly hideous to watch.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.380
It's a problem.
Um, okay, fine.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.982
Well, we'll deal
with that later.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.684
I'm in a little bit of trouble
here. Can you come down

14:12.686 --> 14:14.018
to the Gerharts' charity thing?

14:14.020 --> 14:14.886
I want you to drop me a pin

14:14.888 --> 14:16.821
to your exact location.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.389
Okay, it's at the Windsor.
You know where it is.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.058
I still need the pin.
Why?

14:20.060 --> 14:21.826
Stewart, we don't have time
for this.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.228
Do you want me to help you
or do you want me to teach you

14:23.230 --> 14:24.662
about pins?
Oh, my gosh, fine.

14:24.664 --> 14:25.663
I'll text you the pin.

14:25.665 --> 14:28.066
Go, Lizzie!

14:28.068 --> 14:29.968
Sanderson, you're out!

14:29.970 --> 14:31.736
(buzzer sounds)
Someone else come in.

14:31.738 --> 14:32.904
Anyone.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.340
It's been challenging.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.475
In and out of hospitals.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.410
My parents' finances
have taken a huge hit.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.012
But what's kept me going,
if I had to narrow it down

14:41.014 --> 14:42.146
to one thing...

14:42.148 --> 14:43.748
<i> The Grinder.</i>
<i> The Grinder.</i>

14:43.750 --> 14:44.749
Is Dean

14:44.751 --> 14:45.550
on his way?

14:45.552 --> 14:46.484
He is. Yes.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.486
He's on his way.
LYLE: Great!

14:48.488 --> 14:50.555
'Cause I would love
to introduce you to Judge McCan.

14:50.557 --> 14:54.225
Great. Those things
aren't related though, right?

14:54.227 --> 14:57.428
What do you mean?
Well, just the way you said it.
It felt like Dean needed

14:57.430 --> 14:59.931
to be here in order for you
to-to make the introduction.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.065
Huh.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.066
Where's The Grinder?

15:02.068 --> 15:03.668
He's taking forever.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.670
Um, you know, uh,

15:05.672 --> 15:08.940
uh, Brandon, we're brothers,
Dean and I,

15:08.942 --> 15:12.076
and you know how he
played a lawyer on TV?

15:12.078 --> 15:13.444
I<i> am</i> a lawyer

15:13.446 --> 15:14.913
in real life.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.247
So?

15:16.249 --> 15:18.883
So he just pretends to grind.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.718
Oh, God.
But I...

15:20.720 --> 15:22.954
am actually grinding.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.757
So when you think
about it, right now,

15:25.759 --> 15:27.759
you're meeting the real...

15:27.761 --> 15:29.460
There he is!

15:29.462 --> 15:30.461
Ah.
Ah.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.930
LYLE: Okay.
¶ Ta-da. ¶

15:31.932 --> 15:33.097
(chuckling)

15:33.099 --> 15:33.932
Lyle, Vanessa.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.199
It's killer seeing you again.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.968
(chuckles)

15:36.970 --> 15:38.036
Uh, now, where

15:38.038 --> 15:39.470
is Brandon?
I'm...

15:39.472 --> 15:41.139
I'm Brandon.
Come on! What do
you think I drove

15:41.141 --> 15:42.707
all the way down here for?
Let's hit the bar,

15:42.709 --> 15:44.375
go do some shots.
All right.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.377
(door opening)

15:46.379 --> 15:47.211
(sighs)

15:47.213 --> 15:48.579
Hey.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.548
Dean, thank you
for coming tonight.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.383
I'm sorry to rush you
down here like that.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.085
No, man, it's
part of the job.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.120
You know,
with fame comes responsibility.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.589
It is the life I have chosen
to accept.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.591
H-How'd you get a tux so fast?

16:00.593 --> 16:02.160
Keep one in your car?

16:02.162 --> 16:03.328
Yeah.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.963
So...

16:04.965 --> 16:07.165
have the Gerharts revealed
their true selves?

16:07.167 --> 16:10.168
Uh, yeah, I think they did.
Oh. I am so sorry.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.737
Forget those guys.
If they just took the time
to get to know you,

16:12.739 --> 16:14.238
they wouldn't even care
about meeting me.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.007
Thank you, Dean.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.042
I appreciate that.

16:19.980 --> 16:20.979
I just got sucked in.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.347
Mm-hmm.
I guess I just wanted

16:22.349 --> 16:24.015
to believe that they liked me
for me.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.351
But how can you get someone
to like you for you

16:26.353 --> 16:28.987
if<i> you</i> don't even know
who you are anymore?

16:30.190 --> 16:31.155
I'm talking about me.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.323
Yeah. Sure.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.325
Um, well,
maybe you just

16:34.327 --> 16:37.128
need to take a little time
to get used to this new life.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.464
You know, it's a big change,
Dean. You were this...

16:39.466 --> 16:40.765
other guy for so long.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.133
So-so you're saying

16:42.135 --> 16:45.136
that maybe I committed too hard
to the character

16:45.138 --> 16:47.271
and... and-and lost myself
in it?

16:47.273 --> 16:49.340
Mitch lost himself

16:49.342 --> 16:50.775
in The Grinder.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.378
And I... did, too.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.380
Well, maybe you could just...

16:55.382 --> 16:58.483
grind a little... less.

16:58.485 --> 17:01.185
No. I grind harder.

17:01.187 --> 17:04.022
Harder?
But as Dean. A real human being.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.559
Hey, Stew.
Where's Dean?

17:08.561 --> 17:10.294
Uh, he, uh, had to leave.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.497
Oh, so soon?
He just got here.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.500
He's been here a while.
Took a bunch of pictures.

17:15.502 --> 17:18.503
Aw. That's a shame.
Yeah.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.171
Yeah. Well,

17:20.173 --> 17:22.206
feel free
to stick around.
Mm-hmm.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.244
Uh... sorry, Lyle, real quick,

17:26.246 --> 17:28.212
why wouldn't
we stick around?

17:28.214 --> 17:31.049
No, we-we both just agreed that
you should.
Yeah.
Right.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.383
So why is it even
a conversation?

17:32.385 --> 17:34.052
I don't know
what you mean.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.420
Here's what I mean.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.254
Uh-oh.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.255
I have a hunch

17:37.257 --> 17:40.224
that you two were pretending

17:40.226 --> 17:44.062
to be our friends because you
were using us to get to Dean.

17:44.064 --> 17:47.065
Wow! Well, that's
a hurtful hunch.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.433
But I guess
I could see

17:48.435 --> 17:50.501
how you got there.
Totally.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.602
I mean, these things
can be hard

17:51.604 --> 17:53.337
to figure out. It's murky.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.540
Because you're making it murky?

17:55.542 --> 17:57.075
I could see that, too.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.443
Okay, let's just be
really clear.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.111
Did you or did you not know

18:00.113 --> 18:02.947
when you invited us to dinner
that Dean was my brother?

18:02.949 --> 18:06.951
(scoffs) Honestly, I-I don't
remember how it all went down.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.287
I-I know that we wanted
to be friends with you,

18:09.289 --> 18:11.722
and then, at some point,
we knew that Dean

18:11.724 --> 18:13.724
was your brother,
but I don't really remember

18:13.726 --> 18:15.526
the exact order of it all.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.628
Ugh, we're so
bad with dates.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.098
Are you? Are you bad with dates?

18:20.100 --> 18:22.100
Stew, I think we're getting
caught up in the details.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.535
You're focusing on something
that we're just trying

18:24.537 --> 18:25.870
to glide right over.
Did you even

18:25.872 --> 18:27.438
like the left turn, Lyle?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.640
Is that intersection
even on your commute?

18:29.642 --> 18:30.942
Because I'm starting
to think

18:30.944 --> 18:32.310
that the only honest thing

18:32.312 --> 18:33.478
you've said to us
this entire time

18:33.480 --> 18:35.379
is when you complimented me
on my nice body!

18:35.381 --> 18:37.348
(chatter stops)

18:40.220 --> 18:41.452
Hey, everybody.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.321
Sorry about the false exit.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.289
Um, Brandon, there's
nobody at valet.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.126
I can't find my car. You didn't
run off with it, did you?

18:48.128 --> 18:50.928
(laughter)

18:50.930 --> 18:52.130
Come on. Give me a hand.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.598
(laughter)

18:53.600 --> 18:55.733
Dean's here.
Dean... oh, we better...

18:58.238 --> 18:59.570
(sighs)

19:00.940 --> 19:02.273
Well, that was a shame.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.242
Yeah, that was a shame.
Excuse me,

19:04.244 --> 19:05.143
I'm Paul McCan.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.277
Uh, Your Honor,

19:06.279 --> 19:08.246
of course, hello.
I just want to say

19:08.248 --> 19:10.148
it's about time that someone put
those two phonies

19:10.150 --> 19:12.150
in their place.
Yes, sir.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.819
Uh, thank you.
And did I hear right?

19:14.821 --> 19:16.687
Dean Sanderson is your brother?

19:16.689 --> 19:18.756
Mm-hmm.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.198
¶ ¶

19:32.205 --> 19:33.771
Motive.

19:38.711 --> 19:42.313
No! That's not it.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.215
Connect the dots.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.154
What am I not seeing?!

19:50.156 --> 19:52.156
(grunts)

19:52.158 --> 19:54.525
(sighs)
CLAIRE:
<i> Those are background checks.</i>

19:54.527 --> 19:56.994
<i> I need someone to go</i>
<i>through them and summarize them</i>

19:56.996 --> 19:58.529
<i> for me by tomorrow.</i>

19:58.531 --> 20:01.732
¶ ¶

20:15.481 --> 20:18.649
My God.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.319
DEAN:
<i> I pulled an all-nighter.</i>

20:21.321 --> 20:23.387
And I've got something I think
you're gonna want to see.

20:23.389 --> 20:26.390
Where'd you find this?

20:26.392 --> 20:28.559
You can find pretty much
anything if you dig deep enough.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.894
And it was you

20:29.896 --> 20:31.395
who made me realize...

20:31.397 --> 20:33.431
I like to dig deep.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.099
Oh. Gross.

20:35.101 --> 20:38.236
Our client broke his left
hand in a wrestling match

20:38.238 --> 20:39.870
days before
the fight.
And the bruises

20:39.872 --> 20:41.239
are on the plaintiff's
right cheek.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.441
Our guy's clean.
Just like he said.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.376
The problem is
everybody thinks

20:45.378 --> 20:47.278
he's something he's not.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.213
Wow. I got to say, uh,

20:49.215 --> 20:50.848
I didn't think
that you would be useful

20:50.850 --> 20:52.216
in...

20:52.218 --> 20:54.218
any way. But...

20:54.220 --> 20:56.220
this is huge. Thank you.

20:56.222 --> 20:58.089
Eh. Anybody could've done it.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.590
Right place at the right time.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.025
No. You put in the work.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.493
I underestimated you.

21:10.637 --> 21:13.404
Why did you do that?

21:13.406 --> 21:16.540
Do what now?
Did you think that because
that happened on the show

21:16.542 --> 21:18.142
that...
Did that happen on the show?

21:18.144 --> 21:19.810
Oh, yes.
Oh. It did.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.812
No. It didn't have anything
to do with that.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.614
Unless you want it

21:23.616 --> 21:24.448
to...
I don't.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.883
Great.
Clean this up?

21:25.885 --> 21:28.185
Yep.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.495
Will they? Won't they?

21:37.497 --> 21:39.964
What was that?
Nothing.
