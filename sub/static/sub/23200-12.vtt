03:28.407 --> 03:32.411
Look at them, hypocritical bunch of fools.

03:33.412 --> 03:37.208
Each of them is secretly overjoyed
at Harlow Gault's death.

03:38.209 --> 03:40.711
But I'm not dead, am I, my pet?

03:42.380 --> 03:46.133
The essence of my genius,
my spectacular brain, lives on.

03:46.675 --> 03:48.761
I am invincible.

05:25.565 --> 05:27.776
Just a few more pages, Tara.

05:35.658 --> 05:38.286
Catching up on your reading, Mr. Gault?

05:38.369 --> 05:41.206
Today, I'm tackling the Russian classics.

05:41.873 --> 05:43.041
There:

05:44.959 --> 05:48.588
Read in less than an hour.
Not bad, eh, Doctor?

05:48.671 --> 05:51.758
To think people can do more
without their bodies than with them.

05:51.841 --> 05:55.094
Watch, I'll show you something else.

06:14.739 --> 06:16.491
Theatrical, I admit.

06:16.657 --> 06:21.120
But once the brain doesn't have to
drag around a worn-out, rotting skeleton...

06:21.204 --> 06:23.623
it is capable of almost anything.

06:23.998 --> 06:25.791
Even psychokinesis.

06:25.875 --> 06:28.085
You see, my theory was correct.

06:28.252 --> 06:32.131
By releasing the brain
from the task of operating a body...

06:32.381 --> 06:36.636
I've unleashed psychic talents
that lie dormant in everyone.

06:36.719 --> 06:38.471
Don't get too worked up.

06:38.554 --> 06:41.223
After all, those talents aren't
going to stay unleashed.

06:41.307 --> 06:45.311
That's up to you, isn't it?
We haven't much time.

06:45.394 --> 06:48.481
Don't worry, you'll have your
raw materials for your transplant...

06:48.564 --> 06:51.317
- very shortly, Doctor.
- Good.

06:51.442 --> 06:54.737
Speaking of which,
I have some appointments to keep.

07:04.830 --> 07:05.915
Mr. Gault?

07:05.998 --> 07:08.167
Good news or bad news, Turk?

07:08.250 --> 07:11.921
Bad. Just found out that the IADC...

07:13.505 --> 07:16.800
has formally assigned Diana Prince...

07:16.884 --> 07:19.136
to investigate the fire we set.

07:19.219 --> 07:22.765
She's supposed to meet again
with Stryker this afternoon.

07:23.015 --> 07:25.142
Why, that's good news, Turk.

07:25.851 --> 07:29.271
For it means we'd better get rid
of Miss Prince once and for all...

07:29.354 --> 07:30.773
does it not?

07:31.815 --> 07:35.944
No guns, Turk, just a regrettable accident.

07:36.570 --> 07:37.863
Y es, sir.

08:13.940 --> 08:15.734
That was marvelous.

08:15.817 --> 08:17.944
You should have no trouble
making the Olympics.

08:18.028 --> 08:19.696
The decathlon is my favorite event.

08:19.779 --> 08:21.698
I just work out on the bar
to keep in shape.

08:21.781 --> 08:24.701
This picture doesn't even begin
to suggest the shape you're in.

08:26.036 --> 08:29.164
Oh, that. I didn't even know
that guy was taking my picture.

08:30.582 --> 08:34.376
Have you thought over
what we discussed on the phone, Morton?

08:34.961 --> 08:36.962
I don't know, Miss Landon.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.341
- Tara.
- Tara.

08:42.010 --> 08:46.181
Eliminations are coming up,
and I'm training pretty hard these days.

08:46.389 --> 08:49.809
You could train in my uncle's gym
while you're working for him.

08:49.893 --> 08:53.730
I don't know anything
about being an athletic director, though.

08:53.813 --> 08:57.859
Why don't you at least come in
and see if you qualify for the job?

08:58.109 --> 09:01.404
If you do,
you can give me your final decision then.

09:01.779 --> 09:03.156
Fair enough?

09:06.326 --> 09:09.704
- That's your uncle's address?
- See you there at 3:00?

09:11.664 --> 09:13.291
I hope it won't take too long.

09:13.374 --> 09:16.044
I still have 10 miles to run
sometime today.

09:16.127 --> 09:19.088
You might just find
that once you talk to my uncle...

09:19.172 --> 09:21.174
all thoughts of competing
in the Olympics...

09:21.257 --> 09:23.342
are gone from your head.

09:47.783 --> 09:50.369
I could get a federal warrant, Mr. Stryker.

09:50.453 --> 09:53.039
And if you don't start answering
some of my questions...

09:53.122 --> 09:54.874
that's exactly what I'll do.

09:54.957 --> 09:57.001
I don't like being strong-armed,
Miss Prince.

09:57.084 --> 09:59.795
Besides, I've got a board meeting
in five minutes.

09:59.879 --> 10:02.214
What do you know
about Thomas J. Craddock?

10:02.298 --> 10:03.424
Nothing.

10:03.507 --> 10:06.468
Then it might interest you to know
that it appears likely...

10:06.552 --> 10:10.222
he will soon gain
majority stock control of Gault Industries.

10:11.515 --> 10:14.310
Bad news really travels fast, doesn't it?

10:14.560 --> 10:16.228
Look, I don't know the man.

10:16.312 --> 10:19.732
I never even heard of him
until less than 10 days ago.

10:21.233 --> 10:24.528
Nor had anyone else.
It's strange he should suddenly appear...

10:24.611 --> 10:28.407
just when Gault Industries is in trouble,
and its stock drops lower each day.

10:28.490 --> 10:29.950
Almost sounds planned, doesn't it?

10:30.075 --> 10:31.994
Now, listen-

10:32.578 --> 10:34.997
- Come in.
- Excuse me, Mr. Stryker.

10:35.789 --> 10:40.002
Miss Prince, this is Emil Berger,
Mr. Berger, Diana Prince.

10:40.085 --> 10:42.838
She's with the IADC.

10:43.172 --> 10:44.214
Oh?

10:56.059 --> 10:58.270
All right, Berger. Thank you.

11:06.069 --> 11:10.282
Looks as though major disaster
number three just hit Gault Industries.

11:10.365 --> 11:13.452
I'm afraid I have that meeting now,
Miss Prince.

11:14.536 --> 11:17.164
And if you want to talk to me again...

11:17.664 --> 11:19.457
you'd better get that warrant.

11:19.541 --> 11:22.502
They say that bad luck
comes in threes, Mr. Stryker.

11:22.586 --> 11:26.631
And I have the feeling that, in this case,
that's an underestimate.

11:33.805 --> 11:35.140
Taxi, lady?

11:38.351 --> 11:41.980
500 North Capitol,
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

11:42.313 --> 11:43.648
Yes, ma'am.

12:01.916 --> 12:04.919
It's pretty cold, huh?
How about some heat back there?

12:05.003 --> 12:06.629
No, it's all right, thank you.

12:06.713 --> 12:11.175
Come on, try it.
It's brand new, I just had it installed.

12:11.634 --> 12:13.636
All right, if you insist.

13:04.395 --> 13:05.646
Hold it.

13:35.342 --> 13:37.136
Goodbye, Miss Prince.

13:37.594 --> 13:38.720
- Let's go.
- Okay.

14:15.132 --> 14:16.883
It had to be Stryker, Steve.

14:17.259 --> 14:21.471
He's resented our interference
in his private matters from day one.

14:21.972 --> 14:25.142
You'd think he could've been
a little more subtle, though.

14:25.225 --> 14:28.270
That's why I can't believe
he ordered the attempt on your life.

14:28.353 --> 14:31.439
If corporate heads are anything,
they are subtle. And efficient.

14:31.523 --> 14:34.359
If he wanted you out of the way,
you would be out of the way.

14:34.442 --> 14:37.654
So what other toes
have I been stepping on lately?

14:38.029 --> 14:42.450
Hopefully, Ira can come up with something
from the fingerprints in the taxi.

14:42.534 --> 14:43.994
Which was stolen, I imagine?

14:44.077 --> 14:46.663
And wisely abandoned. Here we go now.

14:59.509 --> 15:02.595
Looks like only three clear prints
were lifted.

15:02.679 --> 15:04.973
Ira pulled photos for each one.

15:05.348 --> 15:08.017
Photo number one: Nettlebaum, Selma A.

15:08.101 --> 15:11.521
Mother of Eugene Nettlebaum,
wife of Morris Nettlebaum.

15:12.397 --> 15:14.857
She has something to do
with an attempt on my life?

15:17.527 --> 15:20.154
Obviously Ira's idea of a little joke.

15:21.155 --> 15:23.241
Photo number two: Diana...

15:26.035 --> 15:27.120
Cute.

15:35.878 --> 15:36.963
Listen, you.

15:37.046 --> 15:41.634
You tell Ira that he's about that far
from having his plug pulled, you hear?

15:46.430 --> 15:49.392
This is him. The guy driving the cab.

15:50.351 --> 15:53.312
Turk, George P.
Eleven arrests, five convictions...

15:53.396 --> 15:56.065
for crimes ranging from arson
to armed robbery.

15:56.148 --> 16:00.653
Paroled last year. Now employed
as a bodyguard for Harlow Gault...

16:01.028 --> 16:02.697
founder of Gault Industries.

16:02.780 --> 16:05.366
Why would a dead man's bodyguard
want me out of the way?

16:05.449 --> 16:08.911
Bodyguards take orders.
The question now is, from whom?

16:09.829 --> 16:11.664
Well, I sure hope my car is tuned up...

16:11.747 --> 16:16.126
because I'm about to pay a visit
to the estate of the late Harlow Gault.

16:16.252 --> 16:19.255
And I have no intention
of taking another cab.

16:30.599 --> 16:31.767
Go on.

16:51.370 --> 16:55.249
Good. Tell Dr. Crippin
to have the equipment ready.

16:56.166 --> 16:58.585
I'll see the young man right away.

17:01.004 --> 17:03.507
That athlete I was telling you about
has just arrived.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.592
Let's have a look at him.

17:13.849 --> 17:18.188
Wait till you see his shoulders,
and the muscles in his legs.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.356
What's his name?

17:19.439 --> 17:23.109
Morton Danzig.
An Olympic hopeful. Decathlon.

17:23.193 --> 17:25.779
- Means he has stamina.
- Among other things.

17:25.862 --> 17:29.825
I don't know, Tara.
I think he's too much an athlete.

17:29.991 --> 17:33.995
Nonsense. Dr. Crippin said the donor
had to be in perfect physical condition.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.289
And that's what I call perfect.

17:36.373 --> 17:38.375
What I mean, my darling...

17:38.833 --> 17:41.920
is that perhaps he's too much
in the public eye.

17:42.379 --> 17:45.048
How would it look for him
to suddenly, without warning...

17:45.131 --> 17:48.051
become the financial wizard
that takes over Gault Industries?

17:48.134 --> 17:52.263
But, Harlow, you promised.
You said the choice would be mine...

17:52.347 --> 17:55.767
and you'd do whatever had to be done
to legitimize who I found.

17:55.850 --> 17:58.645
Yes, that was our arrangement, wasn't it?

17:59.062 --> 18:03.358
Your reward for serving a sickly old man
for three years.

18:03.608 --> 18:05.026
Four.

18:05.109 --> 18:07.445
Since you've obviously
taken a fancy to him...

18:07.779 --> 18:09.948
let's hope, my passion flower...

18:10.031 --> 18:12.784
that he passes all of Dr. Crippin's tests.

18:12.867 --> 18:15.370
Good. I'll get him started right away.

18:44.774 --> 18:47.026
Morton, how nice to see you again.

18:47.109 --> 18:49.737
- That job still open?
- It certainly is.

18:50.238 --> 18:52.823
And while you're being interviewed...

18:52.949 --> 18:55.451
we have a few tests for you to take.

18:56.953 --> 19:01.082
If those are written tests, like in math
or history, I can tell you right now-

19:01.165 --> 19:03.125
No, these are physical tests, Morton.

19:03.209 --> 19:04.669
To be perfectly blunt with you...

19:04.752 --> 19:07.797
we're interested in your body,
not your brains.

19:08.255 --> 19:10.007
The gym is this way.

19:12.802 --> 19:14.136
Excuse me.

19:18.474 --> 19:22.728
Hello, I'd like to see Mr. Turk, please.
I'm Diana Prince with the IADC.

19:24.480 --> 19:25.523
Please come in.

19:26.482 --> 19:28.609
That blundering fool, Turk!

19:31.487 --> 19:35.991
I'll be with you in a minute, Miss Prince.
Just through that door, Morton.

19:39.244 --> 19:42.873
- I've seen him before, haven't I?
- I really wouldn't know.

19:43.457 --> 19:45.209
Why are all the bodies beautiful?

19:45.292 --> 19:47.669
We're hiring some security guards
for the estate.

19:47.753 --> 19:50.297
Wait right here. I'll be right back.

19:59.973 --> 20:01.433
You know who's out there.

20:01.517 --> 20:04.561
Let her talk to you in here.
I'll do the rest.

20:22.996 --> 20:25.290
You were asking about Mr. Turk?

20:26.208 --> 20:28.960
Yes, he is still working here, isn't he?

20:30.253 --> 20:32.547
Why are you interested in Mr. Turk?

20:32.631 --> 20:36.176
For openers, he tried to kill me.

20:37.469 --> 20:39.387
- Are you certain?
- Very.

20:39.596 --> 20:41.556
Do you know where he is?

20:43.058 --> 20:44.851
No, I'm afraid I don't.

20:44.935 --> 20:49.522
After Mr. Gault's unfortunate death,
his services were no longer needed.

20:49.731 --> 20:52.067
Maybe not here at the estate...

20:52.150 --> 20:53.818
but I know for a fact...

20:53.902 --> 20:56.696
that he is still
on the Gault Industries payroll.

20:56.780 --> 21:00.116
Yes, that's correct,
he's now working for Mr. Stryker.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.242
Stryker?

21:01.326 --> 21:06.247
Yes, he said that he could use a man
with Turk's background...

21:06.331 --> 21:08.082
whatever that meant.

21:08.249 --> 21:11.002
I guess he knows that Turk is an ex-con.

21:12.504 --> 21:14.881
- You didn't know that?
- Of course not.

21:14.964 --> 21:19.010
If Mr. Gault had known that,
he never would have been hired.

21:19.427 --> 21:21.638
All right. One last question:

21:22.263 --> 21:25.850
Did Mr. Gault ever meet
with a Thomas J. Craddock?

21:26.351 --> 21:28.269
No, not that I know of.

21:32.607 --> 21:35.068
I'm terribly sorry.
I don't know how that happened.

21:37.612 --> 21:41.991
I could've sworn Sir Lancelot
was stuffed in the corner when we arrived.

21:49.665 --> 21:53.294
No harm done. A few new screws
and he'll be as good as new.

21:53.377 --> 21:55.630
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Yes, I'm sure you are.

21:55.713 --> 21:58.132
I can't explain how that happened.

21:58.299 --> 21:59.967
I'm really sorry.

22:01.010 --> 22:03.137
For what it's worth, I've got a theory.

22:03.554 --> 22:04.597
Ghosts.

22:09.060 --> 22:11.771
Morton Danzig. I knew I saW him before.

22:12.063 --> 22:14.482
People are saying
he might win the United States...

22:14.565 --> 22:16.609
five gold medals in the next Olympics.

22:16.692 --> 22:18.819
And the eliminations
haven't even been held yet.

22:18.903 --> 22:21.739
I can't understand
why I don't remember his picture.

22:21.822 --> 22:23.699
I think he has a few attributes...

22:23.783 --> 22:26.785
that women might find
more memorable than men.

22:27.161 --> 22:30.998
In any case, I'm going to have Ira see
if he can figure out...

22:31.332 --> 22:34.001
what Morton was doing
at the Gault estate.

22:34.084 --> 22:37.087
You don't buy that security guard story,
do you?

22:37.171 --> 22:40.966
Since when do security guards
have to look like Bruce Jenner?

22:41.675 --> 22:42.843
Hello.

22:43.344 --> 22:47.806
Yeah, wait a minute. What's the address?
1205. How long will he be there?

22:49.141 --> 22:50.893
Okay, thanks.

22:51.101 --> 22:54.146
Stryker's not in the office,
but that's where you can find him.

22:55.314 --> 22:56.315
Good.

22:56.690 --> 22:58.859
Hopefully he'll give me
some straight talk...

22:58.942 --> 23:01.528
now that I know he hired Turk
to get rid of me.

23:01.612 --> 23:04.615
But remember, the police
haven't been able to round up Turk yet.

23:04.698 --> 23:07.075
And until they do,
it's Stryker's word against yours.

23:07.159 --> 23:08.702
I don't know, Steve.

23:08.785 --> 23:12.706
I have a certain knack
for getting people to level with me.

23:15.709 --> 23:16.793
Pull!

23:29.097 --> 23:31.058
I believe this is yours.

23:36.313 --> 23:38.231
What are you doing here?

23:38.315 --> 23:41.193
I was hoping
that we could have a little chat.

23:41.276 --> 23:42.444
A little chat?

23:42.527 --> 23:45.697
You ordered George Turk
to kill Diana Prince, didn't you?

23:45.780 --> 23:47.199
I did no such thing.

23:47.282 --> 23:49.993
But Turk still does work
for Gault Industries, doesn't he?

23:50.076 --> 23:52.746
Turk was one of Gault's right-hand men.

23:53.413 --> 23:55.582
Who's giving him orders now?

23:56.166 --> 23:58.668
Ask Tara Landon, Gault's secretary.

23:59.461 --> 24:02.213
Turk must be taking orders from her now.

24:02.422 --> 24:04.382
Someone's trying to sabotage
your company.

24:04.466 --> 24:05.842
Is it Thomas J. Craddock?

24:05.925 --> 24:10.055
My research shows no such person exists.
It was just a name on paper.

24:10.138 --> 24:12.766
Whoever is using that name
is obviously trying to gain...

24:12.849 --> 24:15.018
majority control
of Gault Industries' stock...

24:15.101 --> 24:18.438
and possibly set himself up
as chairman of the board.

24:18.521 --> 24:21.566
Who? Is there someone
who would like to see you ruined?

24:21.733 --> 24:23.193
Harlow Gault.

24:23.526 --> 24:25.111
Harlow Gault is dead.

24:25.195 --> 24:26.571
He hated me.

24:27.071 --> 24:30.199
He hated the fact that I would
control his company when he died.

24:30.283 --> 24:32.952
It's as if he's still trying to get me.

24:33.453 --> 24:34.787
Ghosts.

24:37.790 --> 24:40.626
Well, Mr. Stryker, thank you.

24:41.002 --> 24:43.838
You can go back
to your target practice now.

24:43.921 --> 24:45.465
It looks like fun.

24:45.548 --> 24:47.592
Do you mind if I give it a try?

24:59.437 --> 25:01.689
Pull!

25:09.530 --> 25:11.949
It's much more sporting that way.

25:19.248 --> 25:22.793
- How am I doing, Doc?
- You're doing splendidly, lad.

25:23.335 --> 25:28.299
Ten miles and your heart rate
has hardly risen above normal. Amazing.

25:28.382 --> 25:30.718
Heck, I'm not even warmed up yet.

25:30.801 --> 25:33.387
Dr. Crippin, are you almost finished?

25:33.554 --> 25:35.681
Yes, I think so.

25:40.394 --> 25:42.605
How does Mr. Danzig shape up?

25:44.398 --> 25:46.400
According to my initial readings...

25:46.483 --> 25:49.320
he seems admirably suited
for the position.

25:49.862 --> 25:54.575
I'll have to study all of the test results
before my final decision can be made.

25:54.658 --> 25:58.245
- Something wrong?
- On the contrary, young man.

25:59.747 --> 26:02.082
You appear disgustingly healthy.

26:02.958 --> 26:06.253
It's amazing, just amazing.

26:12.593 --> 26:15.596
I think we'll have some good news for you
in just a few minutes.

26:15.679 --> 26:19.266
Listen, I'm still not sure
I'm all that interested in the job.

26:19.349 --> 26:23.061
Maybe that's because
we haven't really discussed money.

26:23.270 --> 26:25.439
No, it's not the money, it's just that-

26:25.522 --> 26:28.775
How does $1,000 sound to you?

26:29.943 --> 26:32.112
- A month?
- A week.

26:32.195 --> 26:35.615
It would be like getting paid
to train for the Olympics, wouldn't it?

26:35.699 --> 26:36.783
Yeah.

26:36.950 --> 26:39.786
How about it, Morton? Are you interested?

26:40.579 --> 26:41.663
Yeah.

26:44.124 --> 26:47.627
Danzig Morton T., age 25.

26:48.003 --> 26:50.589
Former student at Central University.

26:50.672 --> 26:53.842
Winner of 14 track-and-field competitions.

26:54.259 --> 26:58.096
Any criminal record,
any ties with anyone at Gault Industries?

26:58.263 --> 26:59.514
Negative.

27:00.849 --> 27:03.184
I guess Diana's hunch was wrong.

27:03.393 --> 27:07.355
Morton really was looking for a job
as a security guard. Thanks anyway.

27:07.689 --> 27:09.149
Wait, Steve Trevor.

27:09.232 --> 27:12.360
The IRAC computer has more information
on Morton Danzig.

27:12.444 --> 27:14.237
You've been holding out on me, Ira?

27:14.320 --> 27:16.239
At this moment, computerized data...

27:16.322 --> 27:19.325
concerning his scholastic records
at Central University...

27:19.409 --> 27:20.910
are being tampered with.

27:21.453 --> 27:24.205
Someone's changing his transcript
right now?

27:24.289 --> 27:25.582
Affirmative.

27:25.665 --> 27:30.378
Not only are his grades being raised
from a 2.3 average to a 3.5...

27:30.628 --> 27:34.340
but his major is being changed
from Physical Education to Business.

27:34.424 --> 27:36.301
How many students at Central University?

27:36.384 --> 27:37.552
Fifty-two thousand.

27:38.011 --> 27:40.013
So what the computer says, goes, right?

27:40.096 --> 27:42.181
Which is as it should be...

27:43.808 --> 27:45.435
most of the time.

27:46.978 --> 27:49.522
Obviously, one of your electronic cohorts...

27:49.605 --> 27:53.401
is being used to make Morton Danzig
into something he is not.

27:59.449 --> 28:02.660
Is it possible to arrange a malfunction...

28:02.743 --> 28:04.871
at Central's data processing center...

28:04.954 --> 28:06.706
just to stall anyone who's there...

28:06.789 --> 28:08.791
long enough for me
to have a talk with Morton?

28:08.875 --> 28:10.001
With pleasure.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.086
Then do it.

28:48.497 --> 28:52.084
Well? What's the verdict
on this Morton Danzig?

29:03.762 --> 29:07.599
Basal metabolism, normal.
Triglyceride levels, normal.

29:08.183 --> 29:11.395
Cardiovascular system, normal.

29:11.478 --> 29:14.106
Renal system, normal...

29:14.773 --> 29:18.819
Stop all that mumbo-jumbo, Crippin.
Give me the bottom line.

29:19.111 --> 29:21.113
Is he in perfect condition or not?

29:21.196 --> 29:24.783
In my professional opinion,
he is astoundingly perfect.

29:25.284 --> 29:29.288
There isn't a single solitary thing
I can find wrong with him.

29:29.454 --> 29:32.582
He's got the constitution of a Brahma bull.

29:32.874 --> 29:35.585
I told you I'd get you our man, Doctor.

29:35.877 --> 29:40.298
Prepare him for the transplant at once.
We've already wasted enough time.

29:43.009 --> 29:44.469
Within the hour...

29:44.553 --> 29:46.513
I shall be the first man of science...

29:47.222 --> 29:48.515
to abolish death.

29:48.723 --> 29:50.517
Your brain in Morton's body...

29:50.600 --> 29:55.480
will, in a sense,
make both of us immortal, Mr. Gault.

29:55.647 --> 29:57.399
Correction, Doctor.

29:57.482 --> 30:01.278
Your handiwork Will make you
and Thomas J. Craddock immortal.

30:12.998 --> 30:14.916
- Tara Landon?
- Yes?

30:15.041 --> 30:18.169
My name is Steve Trevor.
I'm with the IADC.

30:18.420 --> 30:22.841
I was told I could find Morton Danzig here.
May I speak with him, please?

30:23.341 --> 30:25.635
- Certainly. Come in.
- Thank you.

30:29.931 --> 30:32.684
He's in the gym. He's quite an athlete.

30:34.018 --> 30:36.020
He's going to be working for us.

30:36.479 --> 30:39.899
Why don't you wait for him in here
while I go get him?

30:48.366 --> 30:52.745
I know better than to ask
what business the IADC has with Morton...

30:52.995 --> 30:55.540
- Mr...
- Trevor. Steve Trevor.

30:55.873 --> 30:57.375
Trevor, right.

30:58.584 --> 31:00.378
Why don't you have a seat?

31:00.461 --> 31:03.339
- And excuse me, I'll go get him.
- Thank you.

31:20.523 --> 31:21.899
Here we are.

31:22.858 --> 31:26.570
Steve Trevor, Morton Danzig.

31:27.196 --> 31:29.990
- How do you do?
- The IADC wants to see me?

31:30.324 --> 31:34.453
- Did I goof up my tax return again?
- No, you're thinking of the IRS.

31:35.329 --> 31:38.541
Why don't you gentlemen have a seat?

31:38.916 --> 31:40.251
And excuse me...

31:40.334 --> 31:42.920
- I'll leave you two alone.
- Thank you.

31:47.258 --> 31:49.552
Morton, are you aware
that, at this very moment...

31:49.635 --> 31:52.388
someone is changing
your college transcript?

31:52.471 --> 31:54.932
Your grade records.
Somebody is tampering with them...

31:55.015 --> 31:56.600
making you look like an A-student...

31:56.684 --> 31:58.978
instead of the C-student
we both know you were.

31:59.061 --> 32:02.064
Sounds great.
Why would anybody want to do that?

32:03.440 --> 32:05.484
I understand
you're gonna be working out here.

32:05.567 --> 32:08.112
I'm gonna run a private gym.
$1,000 a week.

32:08.654 --> 32:11.448
- For running a gym?
- Yeah.

32:12.699 --> 32:14.660
That's very interesting.

32:15.369 --> 32:18.038
Especially since Miss Landon
told one of my co-workers...

32:18.122 --> 32:21.416
you were interviewing
for a job as a security guard.

32:21.500 --> 32:22.709
She did?

32:22.793 --> 32:26.755
Something weird's going on here,
and you seem to be in the middle of it.

32:26.838 --> 32:30.008
- Is there anything you wanna tell me?
- No.

32:30.300 --> 32:33.679
- You in some kind of trouble out here?
- No.

32:34.930 --> 32:38.266
Tara and Dr. Crippin
are about the nicest people I ever met.

32:38.350 --> 32:40.185
For $1,000 a week, they ought to be.

32:40.268 --> 32:45.023
I've heard of plenty of government people
who earn a lot more doing a lot less.

32:45.315 --> 32:49.361
And I bet their employees lied
about why they were hired, too.

32:49.444 --> 32:52.322
Good point. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

32:52.697 --> 32:55.033
I'm gonna leave you
my name and phone number.

32:55.117 --> 32:57.911
If you feel like talking, give me a call.

32:58.328 --> 33:00.205
Any time, day or night.

33:10.423 --> 33:13.677
Thank you, Miss Landon.
Morton, talk to you later.

33:13.969 --> 33:15.762
I'll find my way out.

33:17.013 --> 33:20.433
- It was nice meeting you.
- Thank you. Have a nice day.

33:28.191 --> 33:29.943
- Miss Landon?
- Tara.

33:31.653 --> 33:34.447
Tara, I'd like to ask you some questions.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.867
Not now, Morton. It can wait, can't it?

33:37.951 --> 33:41.788
Why don't you go back to the gym?
I'll see you there later.

33:42.080 --> 33:43.206
Sure.

33:53.341 --> 33:56.803
He was with the IADC.
Why didn't you get rid of him?

33:57.387 --> 33:59.389
There was no need, my pet.

33:59.639 --> 34:02.642
Morton handled him perfectly
without even knowing it.

34:02.725 --> 34:06.229
We're too close to the end
to risk any untidiness, Tara.

34:06.395 --> 34:08.773
Tell Crippin that as soon
as our colleagues return...

34:08.856 --> 34:10.900
the transplant will begin.

34:24.956 --> 34:27.625
Ira, do you think
the man we're looking for...

34:27.708 --> 34:29.585
is still at the data processing center?

34:29.668 --> 34:34.297
Affirmative. Do you wish me to undo
the malfunction I created...

34:34.382 --> 34:36.550
in the university's computer?

34:37.467 --> 34:39.094
Give me five minutes, then undo it.

34:39.178 --> 34:42.098
Meanwhile, call Diana and tell her
to meet me there right away.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.808
- You got that?
- Ten-four.

34:44.225 --> 34:45.391
Bye.

34:45.976 --> 34:47.311
Ten-four?

34:58.906 --> 35:00.407
IADC. Hold it!

35:42.741 --> 35:44.368
Get moving, fast.

36:01.218 --> 36:02.552
I'm with the IADC.

36:22.822 --> 36:26.284
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Who are you working for?

36:26.368 --> 36:28.161
He works for Gault Industries.

36:28.244 --> 36:30.455
- Diana.
- Hi, Steve.

36:30.538 --> 36:34.084
Last seen, in fact,
in the office of Mr. Stryker.

36:34.501 --> 36:35.835
So Stryker is behind all this?

36:35.919 --> 36:39.631
Why don't we hear what the man
who faces conspiracy charges has to say?

36:39.714 --> 36:40.924
Look...

36:41.007 --> 36:43.927
Tara Landon gave me the information
to put into the computer.

36:44.010 --> 36:45.595
I just take orders from her.

36:45.678 --> 36:48.223
- What does she want with Morton Danzig?
- I don't know.

36:48.306 --> 36:51.935
Is she trying to make Morton
appear to be Thomas J. Craddock?

36:52.018 --> 36:55.772
Morton Danzig is being held on the estate.
That's all I know.

36:56.064 --> 36:57.190
I swear it.

36:57.273 --> 36:59.484
What're you getting at, Diana?

37:00.735 --> 37:03.488
Stryker told me that he's positive
Thomas J. Craddock...

37:03.571 --> 37:07.283
is just a name someone's using
to buy up Gault Industries stock.

37:07.367 --> 37:10.203
So whoever's using the name
must be sabotaging the company...

37:10.286 --> 37:12.080
to drive down the price of the shares?

37:12.163 --> 37:17.126
Yes, and now it appears very likely
that Tara Landon is setting up Morton...

37:17.210 --> 37:19.462
so he can claim to be Craddock.

37:19.545 --> 37:23.049
But Ira assured me that before today
there was absolutely no connection...

37:23.132 --> 37:25.301
between Danzig and Gault Industries.

37:25.384 --> 37:28.429
Why would anyone set up a stranger
to take over the company?

37:28.512 --> 37:30.890
I don't know, Steve,
but I get the feeling...

37:30.973 --> 37:34.310
that all the answers we need
are at the Gault estate.

37:34.810 --> 37:36.228
I'm going out there.

37:36.312 --> 37:38.314
Diana, wait for a backup.

37:38.981 --> 37:39.982
Give me half an hour.

37:40.066 --> 37:42.109
If you don't hear from me,
then call a backup.

37:42.276 --> 37:44.070
Diana, wait...

37:49.992 --> 37:52.161
Come on, let's go.

38:10.596 --> 38:13.349
There's a couple of questions
I wanted to ask you.

38:13.432 --> 38:15.351
They can wait, can't they?

38:15.434 --> 38:17.019
I don't think so.

38:20.522 --> 38:22.149
What's that for?

38:22.566 --> 38:25.319
Nothing to worry
your head about, Morton.

38:25.652 --> 38:27.362
When you wake up...

38:28.614 --> 38:30.032
you'll be a new man.

38:31.366 --> 38:34.286
If it's all the same with you,
I'll stick with the old me.

38:36.330 --> 38:38.957
It is all the same with you, isn't it?

38:42.252 --> 38:44.171
I'm afraid not, my boy.

38:44.880 --> 38:47.382
You see, this job calls for brawn...

38:48.425 --> 38:50.427
and we supply the brains.

38:52.262 --> 38:54.014
But without this...

38:54.514 --> 38:56.558
how could I remove yours?

38:59.311 --> 39:01.730
I definitely don't want this job.

39:08.945 --> 39:11.281
Don't let him escape, you idiot!

39:48.860 --> 39:51.779
It's time we met face to face, so to speak.

39:54.991 --> 39:56.409
Who are you?

39:57.994 --> 39:59.495
Where are you?

39:59.579 --> 40:01.456
My name is Harlow Gault...

40:01.539 --> 40:04.500
and I'm right smack in front of you,
you young dolt.

40:04.584 --> 40:06.210
I don't see anything but a fish tank.

40:06.294 --> 40:07.378
This fish tank...

40:07.462 --> 40:11.090
holds one of the world's most brilliant
and powerful minds.

40:11.174 --> 40:15.261
You should feel honored to have been
selected as the receptacle for my genius.

40:15.344 --> 40:18.264
You'll excuse me
if I don't accept the honor.

40:48.794 --> 40:51.881
I believe Mr. Danzig
is waiting for you, Doctor.

41:57.279 --> 41:59.114
Are you ready, Doctor?

42:00.157 --> 42:02.117
Just a few more details.

42:59.048 --> 43:02.302
- What's the delay?
- I'm not getting enough current.

43:05.972 --> 43:09.017
Intruder on the grounds,
heading for the house.

43:09.100 --> 43:13.062
Alert the guards, Turk.
And take care of whoever it is yourself.

43:13.313 --> 43:14.355
Hurry, Crippin.

43:27.577 --> 43:29.662
All right, go. Fan out! Go!

43:47.263 --> 43:49.015
Hold it right there!

43:54.020 --> 43:55.771
Continue, you fool.

43:55.938 --> 43:58.357
This is a very delicate operation.

43:58.607 --> 44:01.777
If I'm interrupted, it could be disastrous.

44:01.861 --> 44:04.780
Whatever it was, Turk's taken care ofit.
Go on with it.

44:27.469 --> 44:30.764
Don't stop, Crippin. I'll take care ofher.

44:31.974 --> 44:33.058
Leave it alone.

44:33.142 --> 44:36.311
Powerful as you are,
you're no match for me, Wonder Woman.

44:36.395 --> 44:38.355
Go on with the operation.

44:38.480 --> 44:39.523
No!

45:28.196 --> 45:29.447
Let's go.

45:30.031 --> 45:31.575
Hurry, Crippin.

45:43.169 --> 45:45.046
Where are... They were gonna-

45:45.130 --> 45:48.675
No, not anymore, Morton. They're gone.

46:14.200 --> 46:16.202
It's frightening. He almost pulled it off.

46:16.285 --> 46:19.747
Gault, using Morton's body,
almost took over his own business empire.

46:19.831 --> 46:23.251
Only this time as a vibrant young man
instead of a dying 70-year-old.

46:23.334 --> 46:27.088
Trouble is, there's only one thing
Gault can do, and that's try again.

46:27.171 --> 46:29.132
I'm afraid we haven't heard the last of him.

46:29.215 --> 46:31.467
Who knows what he'll try next?

46:35.012 --> 46:37.139
This is the best I could do.

46:39.433 --> 46:42.728
That Tara.
She had a lot of wigs upstairs.

46:43.646 --> 46:45.314
How does it look?

46:47.066 --> 46:51.404
I don't know, Morton.
I think it looks kind of cute.
