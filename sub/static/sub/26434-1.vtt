[music playing]

00:29.305 --> 00:31.388
Woman:
Have you ever wanted
to live forever?

00:31.388 --> 00:33.222
Maybe now is your chance.

00:33.222 --> 00:36.222
Scientists in Russia
say they're very very close

00:36.222 --> 00:38.721
to unlocking the mysteries
of eternal life.

00:38.721 --> 00:42.388
They just have one cabinet,
and I quote,

00:42.388 --> 00:46.888
Unless something goes wrong
during the experiments, unquote.

00:46.888 --> 00:49.763
Ugh, oh my,
what could possibly go wrong

00:49.763 --> 00:52.596
playing around
with the mysteries
of eternal life?

00:52.596 --> 00:54.805
[echoing]

01:19.263 --> 01:20.721
In international news,

01:20.721 --> 01:23.138
something wicked this way comes.

01:23.138 --> 01:25.013
It's being widely rumored

01:25.013 --> 01:27.013
both in Russia and China

01:27.013 --> 01:29.638
are calling
hundreds of thousands
of chickens

01:29.638 --> 01:30.846
in an attempt

01:30.846 --> 01:32.222
to halt a new variation

01:32.222 --> 01:35.222
of the so called bird flu.

01:35.222 --> 01:38.263
Now haven't we heard
this song and dance before?

01:38.263 --> 01:39.429
Of course, we have.

01:39.429 --> 01:41.554
But this gossip
has whispers

01:41.554 --> 01:43.846
of something
much more fearful and sinister,

01:43.846 --> 01:45.679
happening here.

01:45.679 --> 01:47.471
Our multitalented sources
are working

01:47.471 --> 01:50.471
to confirm the rumors,
but where there's smoke,

01:50.471 --> 01:52.055
there usually is a fire.

01:52.055 --> 01:53.846
And in this case, folks,

01:53.846 --> 01:57.263
I'd venture to say
it could be a raging inferno.

01:58.930 --> 02:00.554
Now excuse me,

02:00.554 --> 02:01.971
but we have to take

02:01.971 --> 02:06.138
an obscene commercial
profit break.

02:06.138 --> 02:09.387
Valentine's Day
is just around the corner,

02:09.387 --> 02:11.846
and you're gonna wanna
look your very best.

02:11.846 --> 02:15.055
Have you ever
wanted your clothes to be
a whiter white?

02:15.055 --> 02:17.138
Well, of course,
you have.

02:17.138 --> 02:19.263
Love is in the air, folks.

03:19.971 --> 03:22.387
[music playing]

03:25.222 --> 03:27.013
Probation, Dale?

03:27.013 --> 03:29.097
I did the best I could.

03:29.097 --> 03:30.513
You can't be the savior

03:30.513 --> 03:33.346
of the every dog and cat
in the city, Max.

03:33.346 --> 03:36.138
Besides, the guy's face
was swollen up like a pumpkin.

03:36.138 --> 03:38.263
He deserved it, Dale.

03:38.263 --> 03:39.679
Be that as it may.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.471
To my best friend,
protector of small children

03:44.471 --> 03:46.596
and small creatures,
great and small.

03:49.679 --> 03:50.846
Hey, what's the difference

03:50.846 --> 03:53.138
between a lawyer
and a vampire?

03:53.138 --> 03:55.846
- Aren't you a lawyer?
- I'm your lawyer.

03:55.846 --> 03:57.554
That's what's
gonna make it funny.

03:57.554 --> 04:01.222
What's the difference between
a lawyer and a vampire?

04:01.222 --> 04:04.304
A vampire
only sucks blood
at night.

04:04.304 --> 04:05.846
Oh, that's funny, Dale.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.096
I got a million of 'em.

04:08.096 --> 04:09.429
That's too bad.

04:39.971 --> 04:42.013
You're drooling.
And drooling is normal.

04:42.013 --> 04:43.930
You're normal, max.

04:43.930 --> 04:46.096
You are just a normal guy.

04:46.096 --> 04:48.429
Hard to accept,
isn't it?

04:48.429 --> 04:49.971
Incoming.

04:52.304 --> 04:53.971
So are you just gonna
stare at me all night

04:53.971 --> 04:57.346
or are you gonna
step up to the plate
like a real man?

04:57.346 --> 04:59.221
[mouthing]

04:59.221 --> 05:01.304
All step up to the plate.

05:01.304 --> 05:05.055
I cant believe that line
actually worked.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.346
- Hey, I'm Sara.
- Max.

05:07.346 --> 05:09.013
- Very nice to meet you, max.
- Nice meeting you.

05:13.013 --> 05:16.055
mimicking Max:
Can I buy you a cocktail?

05:16.055 --> 05:17.346
Yeah, I like that.

05:18.888 --> 05:21.554
Bartender.

05:21.554 --> 05:23.304
Vampire only sucks blood
at night.

05:29.055 --> 05:31.638
Hey, what's a lawyer's favorite
pour-a-cop reception?

05:31.638 --> 05:33.805
- What?
- His personality.

05:34.930 --> 05:36.638
I got a million of 'em.

05:46.930 --> 05:50.471
- So are you coming in?
- I'm not sure.

05:50.471 --> 05:52.554
- It's been awhile for me.
- Oh, Max,

05:52.554 --> 05:54.805
it's like riding a bike.

05:54.805 --> 05:56.429
You know how to ride a bike,
don't you?

05:56.429 --> 05:58.846
I was the bicycle king
of my block, if that counts?

05:58.846 --> 06:00.471
Oh, the whole block?

06:00.471 --> 06:01.930
- Oh yeah.
- Wow.

06:01.930 --> 06:03.513
I'm impressed.

06:03.513 --> 06:06.596
I think you should bring
that whole bicycle king inside.

06:37.221 --> 06:39.096
Will I see you again?

06:42.137 --> 06:44.096
Wild horses
couldn't drag me away.

06:51.013 --> 06:54.262
Has anyone
even taken the time
to read this?

06:54.262 --> 06:55.429
Hello?

06:55.429 --> 06:56.638
Anyone?

06:56.638 --> 06:58.846
For those of you
who do not know,

06:58.846 --> 07:03.262
I performed Shakespeare
on the stage in London.

07:03.262 --> 07:05.554
The bard onstage,

07:05.554 --> 07:07.179
in London.

07:07.179 --> 07:09.596
"A horse, a horse,

07:09.596 --> 07:11.554
my kingdom for a horse."

07:11.554 --> 07:13.055
Mm-hmm.

07:13.055 --> 07:16.471
Can you see the tears
welling up in my eyes?

07:16.471 --> 07:17.930
Can you not?

07:21.013 --> 07:23.221
And you must be the professor.

07:23.221 --> 07:25.304
Yes, but of course,
you are.

07:25.304 --> 07:27.304
Excuse my little tirade,
but this business

07:27.304 --> 07:29.304
can drive a grown man to cry.

07:32.179 --> 07:33.471
Are we ready to shoot this?

07:33.471 --> 07:34.888
Woman:
Are you guys ready up there?

07:34.888 --> 07:37.513
Okay.

07:37.513 --> 07:39.971
- Woman:
All right, quite on the set.
- [bell ringing]

07:39.971 --> 07:41.596
[intro music playing]

07:57.513 --> 07:59.513
Hello, my name is Phil Philbin

07:59.513 --> 08:00.930
and thank you for watching

08:00.930 --> 08:05.013
this edition of "Monster Mania."

08:05.013 --> 08:08.930
Today I have with me my esteemed
guest, Dr. Rupert Stuben,

08:08.930 --> 08:11.137
frequent lecturer
at such stellar institutions as

08:11.137 --> 08:13.805
Harvard and MIT.

08:13.805 --> 08:17.638
He now works exclusively for
the World Health Organization.

08:17.638 --> 08:19.805
Welcome.

08:19.805 --> 08:21.429
Professor,

08:21.429 --> 08:23.429
let me get right
to the point.

08:23.429 --> 08:25.846
Are the rumors true?

08:25.846 --> 08:28.471
Well, we have many new rumors
on a daily basis.

08:28.471 --> 08:30.596
Which rumors are you
talking about specifically?

08:30.596 --> 08:33.011
Uh, duh, let's see.

08:33.011 --> 08:35.221
China killing chickens.

08:35.221 --> 08:38.846
And you may be sinister,
bird flu at our door?

08:38.846 --> 08:40.261
As I'm sure you are aware,

08:40.261 --> 08:42.429
rumors cause,
fear and anxiety

08:42.429 --> 08:43.971
this many of the population.

08:43.971 --> 08:46.221
The young people,
the old people,

08:46.221 --> 08:48.554
uh, especially,
the ill educated.

08:48.554 --> 08:50.554
But more importantly,

08:50.554 --> 08:54.262
the misplaced rumors.

08:54.262 --> 08:55.805
Maybe you're misplaced.

08:55.805 --> 08:58.846
I deal In fact, Mr. Philbin.

08:58.846 --> 09:01.387
I am here to dampen the phobia.

09:01.387 --> 09:03.596
Fact this, professor.

09:03.596 --> 09:07.429
Do you really have the tenacity
to sit there and deny

09:07.429 --> 09:09.970
that China and Russia
are calling foul

09:09.970 --> 09:11.721
at a furious rate?

09:11.721 --> 09:13.554
We do not have proof,

09:13.554 --> 09:17.179
but there is a contagion
in those countries

09:17.179 --> 09:19.387
and the same countries
are doing their best

09:19.387 --> 09:23.179
- to counter measurality--
- Pitfall, gobbledygook.

09:23.179 --> 09:24.970
Let me explain
to our average viewer

09:24.970 --> 09:27.304
what the good professor
just said.

09:27.304 --> 09:29.846
China and Russia
are killing birds

09:29.846 --> 09:32.596
to stop a new,
frightening version

09:32.596 --> 09:34.471
of the Asian bird flu.

09:34.471 --> 09:35.763
That's not fair.

09:35.763 --> 09:37.805
It's not just China and Russia.

09:37.805 --> 09:41.262
There are other countries
where this has spread?

09:41.262 --> 09:43.387
Which countries,
professor?

09:45.054 --> 09:46.471
You know,
why oh why

09:46.471 --> 09:49.471
would a doctor
of your emanant stature

09:49.471 --> 09:52.304
appear on my
"Monster Mania" show?

09:52.304 --> 09:53.721
I-- I'm leaving.

09:53.721 --> 09:54.929
Where are the monsters, Doctor?

09:54.929 --> 09:56.096
Good luck.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.513
What aren't you telling us?

09:58.513 --> 10:01.554
And more importantly,
why aren't you telling us?

10:16.262 --> 10:18.763
[crying in background]

11:43.721 --> 11:45.845
Wow.
Who woulda thought
a big metal box

11:45.845 --> 11:48.596
could look so beautiful?

11:48.596 --> 11:50.221
Well, I hate to be
the bearer bad news,

11:50.221 --> 11:51.929
but they wanna meet.

11:51.929 --> 11:54.179
- They want more.
- More? Really?

11:54.179 --> 11:56.054
They don't think
their 30 percent is enough.

11:56.054 --> 11:57.471
No, no, no,
I'm taking my share

11:57.471 --> 11:59.471
and I'm going to Mexico,
sun, sand, marguerites,

11:59.471 --> 12:01.096
and senoritas.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.346
- What more could a guy want?

12:02.346 --> 12:04.346
You're a smart man.

12:04.346 --> 12:06.054
You know they're gonna
follow us to Mexico,

12:06.054 --> 12:07.679
- don't you?
- Oh yeah.

12:07.679 --> 12:09.387
That's why you and I
will meet them, Dale.

12:09.387 --> 12:11.429
While Isaiah
takes his share
to Mexico?

12:11.429 --> 12:13.054
Mm-hmm.

12:13.054 --> 12:15.679
- That's not fair, Max.
- No, it's not fare, Dale.

12:15.679 --> 12:17.471
Oh.

12:17.471 --> 12:19.346
On second thought,
why don't we all go to Mexico?

12:19.346 --> 12:21.596
- Damn right.
- Set a meet.

12:21.596 --> 12:24.429
Oh, I've got a bad feeling
about this, Max.

12:24.429 --> 12:26.054
Set a meet, Dale.

12:26.054 --> 12:27.679
A really bad feeling.

12:44.054 --> 12:45.845
Girl's voice:
Daddy.

12:47.221 --> 12:49.012
Daddy!

12:50.012 --> 12:51.638
Daddy!

12:53.096 --> 12:54.721
Daddy.

12:54.721 --> 12:56.638
[sound of siren blaring]

12:57.638 --> 13:00.638
Max!

13:00.638 --> 13:03.845
I want that one.

13:03.845 --> 13:05.721
Would you buy it for me?

13:05.721 --> 13:07.721
If it'll make you happy.

13:07.721 --> 13:10.221
- You would, wouldn't you?
- Mm-hmm.

13:10.221 --> 13:11.638
I can buy it myself,
you know?

13:11.638 --> 13:12.845
Oh, I know.

13:15.054 --> 13:17.887
What else would you do for me?

13:17.887 --> 13:20.638
Would you save me
like in the fairy tales?

13:20.638 --> 13:22.638
Would you be
my knight in shining armor?

13:22.638 --> 13:25.929
I'm no knight in shining armor.

13:25.929 --> 13:29.346
- But...
- But I would fight for you.

13:29.346 --> 13:32.513
I would fight
very hard for you.

13:32.513 --> 13:36.346
That's the most romantic thing
anyone has ever said to me.

13:36.346 --> 13:38.554
You're a poet, Max.

13:38.554 --> 13:41.054
You're a poet
and didn't even know it.

13:42.845 --> 13:46.262
Let's go sneak aboard.
Come on, Max.

13:46.262 --> 13:48.845
do something illegal
for the first time in your life.

13:48.845 --> 13:50.262
- How do you know?
- What?

13:50.262 --> 13:51.678
That you haven't done
anything illegal?

13:51.678 --> 13:53.804
Come on.
You're uptight, Max.

13:53.804 --> 13:55.970
I mean,
not in a bad way.

13:55.970 --> 13:58.471
I'm just I'm just saying
you're uptight.

13:58.471 --> 14:01.471
Really, really uptight.

14:01.471 --> 14:03.471
Maybe you should get
a dog or a cat

14:03.471 --> 14:05.845
or something
to loosen you up.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.845
I did have a dog.
She was my best friend.

14:08.845 --> 14:10.471
What happened to her?

14:10.471 --> 14:12.887
She died.

14:12.887 --> 14:14.304
I'm so sorry.

14:14.304 --> 14:15.720
That's all right.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.346
She lived a good long life.

14:21.762 --> 14:23.596
Come aboard.

14:23.596 --> 14:26.387
Your vessel awaits.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.929
Come on, Max.

14:28.929 --> 14:31.346
It can be your ship.
You can be the captain.

14:31.346 --> 14:32.762
- Come on.
- I don't think so.

14:32.762 --> 14:34.387
- Come on, Max.
- No, I don't think so.

14:34.387 --> 14:35.804
- Yes.
- Please.

14:38.012 --> 14:40.012
[speaking Spanish]

15:34.137 --> 15:35.346
[gasps]

15:58.262 --> 16:01.054
My fault
the car broke down?

16:01.054 --> 16:02.678
How could it be my fault?

16:02.678 --> 16:04.595
Next time,
bring your own car
on a date.

16:09.804 --> 16:12.513
Hey, I'm walkin' here.
I walkin' here!

16:22.262 --> 16:24.678
[coughing]

16:41.137 --> 16:43.929
Although they say
it's just a flu-like virus,

16:43.929 --> 16:47.054
my sources indicate
something else entirely.

16:47.054 --> 16:48.637
In just a matter of days,

16:48.637 --> 16:50.595
this virus has made the jump

16:50.595 --> 16:52.553
to cattle, horses,

16:52.553 --> 16:54.678
and an even swine.

16:54.678 --> 16:57.095
Millions, yes,
you heard correctly,

16:57.095 --> 16:59.720
millions of these animals
are being slaughtered

16:59.720 --> 17:01.720
as I speak.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.512
And this is not limited
to just Asia and Russia.

17:04.512 --> 17:06.804
My sources are indicating
this is happening in parts of

17:06.804 --> 17:08.970
Europe, South Africa,

17:08.970 --> 17:12.346
and South America.

17:12.346 --> 17:14.970
Good morning, Professor Z.

17:14.970 --> 17:16.387
You are widely recognized

17:16.387 --> 17:18.678
as the renowned expert

17:18.678 --> 17:21.262
on zombies.

17:21.262 --> 17:24.637
I didn't even know there
was an expert on zombies.

17:24.637 --> 17:27.678
Can you explain
to our less educated viewers

17:27.678 --> 17:29.762
what a zombie is?

17:29.762 --> 17:31.387
I am delighted you asked.

17:31.387 --> 17:33.387
Zombies go by various names,

17:33.387 --> 17:36.387
the living dead, the undead,
the walking dead,

17:36.387 --> 17:37.804
soulless corpses.

17:37.804 --> 17:39.887
A zombie is a being created

17:39.887 --> 17:43.221
through the reanimation
of a human corpse.

17:43.221 --> 17:45.470
It's also
a pretty mean rum drink.

17:47.720 --> 17:51.012
Uh, uh,
but, I, uh, I digress.

17:51.012 --> 17:55.262
Um, have you
ever seen a zombie,
professor?

17:55.262 --> 17:56.678
Oh my, yes.

17:56.678 --> 17:58.096
On both of my expeditions

17:58.096 --> 18:00.221
through South Africa
and the Caribbean.

18:00.221 --> 18:02.221
That is why I'm skeptical.

18:02.221 --> 18:04.221
I'm hearing
this virus is creating

18:04.221 --> 18:07.553
variations of what
we would call a zombie,

18:07.553 --> 18:09.970
cannibalism, mindless attacks,

18:09.970 --> 18:12.595
the change of skin
and eye color,

18:12.595 --> 18:14.845
- and they walk funny.
- Mm.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.887
Uh, can you give us
a demonstration?

18:18.887 --> 18:20.720
I would be delighted.

18:32.595 --> 18:34.637
Yeah,
I don't know about
our viewers,

18:34.637 --> 18:37.512
but I would not want
that coming after me.

18:37.512 --> 18:39.512
Ouch.
Okay.

18:39.512 --> 18:41.720
Thanks you.
Thank you, Professor Zee.

18:44.387 --> 18:46.387
It has been
a delightful pleasure.

18:46.387 --> 18:48.386
[laughs]

18:48.386 --> 18:51.386
Well, this I do know.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.720
This is no regular virus.

18:54.720 --> 18:58.470
People are not getting
flu-like symptoms.

18:58.470 --> 19:01.346
People are changing.

19:01.346 --> 19:05.262
People are transforming.

19:07.595 --> 19:10.386
There's talk
of herd mentality violence.

19:10.386 --> 19:13.221
Violence, unlike anything
we have seen before.

19:14.595 --> 19:16.804
And those
that are not transforming,

19:16.804 --> 19:19.637
they are dying.

19:19.637 --> 19:22.054
They're dying
not in a month, or a week,

19:22.054 --> 19:23.887
or even a day days.

19:23.887 --> 19:25.512
No, they're dying
within minutes

19:25.512 --> 19:29.095
of contracting
this so-called virus.

19:29.095 --> 19:32.512
And the mortality rate
is off the charts.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.095
We hope to have
more information

19:37.095 --> 19:39.887
on this fast evolving story

19:39.887 --> 19:43.012
on our later broadcasts.

20:05.221 --> 20:06.804
Follow me.

20:09.386 --> 20:10.720
Max.

20:23.179 --> 20:25.637
I like what you've done
with the place.

20:25.637 --> 20:27.386
- Is he trying to be funny?
- I don't know.

20:27.386 --> 20:30.095
Are you trying to be funny?

20:30.095 --> 20:33.221
Are you trying to be funny?

20:33.221 --> 20:35.262
I should staple
your eyelids shut.

20:35.262 --> 20:37.096
- That would be funny.
- You know,

20:37.096 --> 20:38.637
we were all surprised

20:38.637 --> 20:42.221
when you pulled off
your, uh, very first job.

20:42.221 --> 20:44.012
Right, first job?

20:44.012 --> 20:45.637
Big brass balls
is what we should call you.

20:45.637 --> 20:48.386
How did you make it so easy?

20:48.386 --> 20:50.137
How did he do it?

20:50.137 --> 20:52.678
Come on,
you can tell us.
How'd he do it?

20:52.678 --> 20:54.929
Tell us
or we'll chop off
your balls.

20:54.929 --> 20:57.428
Um, remote pepper spray.

20:57.428 --> 21:00.929
Pepper spray?
Explain.

21:00.929 --> 21:02.553
Well, you

21:02.553 --> 21:04.553
break into the armored car
the previous night

21:04.553 --> 21:06.762
and plant the cans
under the seats.

21:06.762 --> 21:08.970
Ah man, it's gonna happen.
It's an armored car.

21:11.553 --> 21:14.804
You can activate them by remote
up to 500 feet away.

21:25.261 --> 21:27.261
All that bright yellow metal,

21:27.261 --> 21:28.887
all those rectangular bars...

21:28.887 --> 21:30.637
- Oh yeah.
- It must've been great

21:30.637 --> 21:32.678
to hold those bars
in your hands.

21:32.678 --> 21:34.428
Power, Max.

21:34.428 --> 21:37.179
That is what
pure gold is,

21:37.179 --> 21:38.929
power.

21:38.929 --> 21:41.553
What is it with you
that you won't talk?

21:41.553 --> 21:44.386
Maybe you can only talk
when you're trying to be funny?

21:51.303 --> 21:52.970
You work for us now, Max.

21:52.970 --> 21:55.512
- I don't think so.
- Now he speaks.

21:55.512 --> 21:57.678
Mister big brass balls speaks.

21:57.678 --> 21:59.303
Make no mistake, Max.

21:59.303 --> 22:00.720
We own you.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.345
We own you,
we own your girlfriend,

22:03.345 --> 22:07.303
we own you like a car
or a dog.

22:07.303 --> 22:10.637
So here's what's gonna happen.

22:10.637 --> 22:12.261
Here's your new job.

22:12.261 --> 22:14.887
It should be easy for a smart,
funny guy like you.

22:14.887 --> 22:18.762
Due to time constraints,
you need to do the job tonight.

22:18.762 --> 22:21.678
And just to make sure
you remain loyal,

22:21.678 --> 22:25.386
we're keeping
your little friend
here with us.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.220
And if I refuse?

22:27.220 --> 22:29.303
We're gonna chop 'em up
into tiny little pieces

22:29.303 --> 22:30.595
and send him home.

22:30.595 --> 22:33.678
And you still
have to do the job.

22:33.678 --> 22:35.095
Time's wasting, Max.

22:35.095 --> 22:37.386
Tick-tock.

22:37.386 --> 22:40.595
- Tick-tock.
- Clock's ticking.

22:40.595 --> 22:42.762
See you tomorrow night,
funny Guy.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.762
Now you can go.

22:44.762 --> 22:46.386
You've got work to do.

22:56.386 --> 22:59.386
Grr-ruff!
We own you, Max.

22:59.386 --> 23:00.804
You're our lapdog.

23:00.804 --> 23:02.470
Ruff! Ruff!

23:02.470 --> 23:04.303
- And that girlfriend of yours.
- Let's just say

23:04.303 --> 23:07.012
it'll be a shame if we have
to make her a little pet.

23:07.012 --> 23:08.178
Ruff! Ruff!

23:10.553 --> 23:12.345
[barking]

23:39.845 --> 23:42.178
Max has a water phobia.

23:42.178 --> 23:43.595
A water phobia?

23:43.595 --> 23:46.220
Hell, two more days out here

23:46.220 --> 23:48.970
and I'll get a sand phobia.

23:52.595 --> 23:54.804
That was a good one.

23:54.804 --> 23:58.220
Uh, yeah.
Uh, oh.

23:58.220 --> 24:01.054
You know, you're the only one
that can still make me laugh.

24:01.054 --> 24:02.678
Oh, that's a hell of a burden

24:02.678 --> 24:05.386
on the shoulders
of a talking doll.

24:05.386 --> 24:07.678
I wanna thank you for just,

24:07.678 --> 24:09.094
you know, always being

24:09.094 --> 24:11.720
and letting me
talk to you and share,

24:11.720 --> 24:15.470
and you know, and...

24:15.470 --> 24:18.220
Now don't get me crying.

24:18.220 --> 24:21.054
[muttering]
...you know better.

24:21.054 --> 24:22.470
Okay, okay,

24:22.470 --> 24:25.845
let's, let's--
oh, let's don't get mushy.

24:25.845 --> 24:28.053
You know,
Max is a good Guy,

24:28.053 --> 24:29.345
- but...
- But what?

24:29.345 --> 24:32.345
Well,
he may look like a Guy

24:32.345 --> 24:34.970
that works in
an office building,

24:34.970 --> 24:37.470
but he's got a history,
believe me.

24:37.470 --> 24:38.845
Oh yeah?
Look.

24:38.845 --> 24:41.470
I'm shaking all over.

24:41.470 --> 24:43.887
History's mystery.

24:43.887 --> 24:46.720
Max, you should do wet work
for the government.

24:46.720 --> 24:49.178
He was really good at it.
That's what I hear.

24:49.178 --> 24:50.595
Oh yeah?

24:50.595 --> 24:53.470
So he was like, uh,
an assassin?

24:53.470 --> 24:56.345
A killer?
A liquidator?

24:56.345 --> 24:58.970
A executioner?

24:58.970 --> 25:00.804
Yeah, something like that.

25:00.804 --> 25:02.553
Well, I'm tattoo,
you know?

25:02.553 --> 25:04.762
I once kicked a kid
in the shins

25:04.762 --> 25:08.720
'cause he kept
calling me "Tanochio."

25:08.720 --> 25:11.345
I can stand a lot,
but that was just too much.

25:11.345 --> 25:15.053
Men and sometimes boys
do evil deeds.

25:15.053 --> 25:16.470
Ain't that the truth.

25:16.470 --> 25:17.887
[chuckles]

25:17.887 --> 25:21.762
Ah, okay,
well, what we learned is, uh,

25:21.762 --> 25:23.303
these guys
are imported gangsters.

25:23.303 --> 25:25.094
They immigrated here

25:25.094 --> 25:27.095
to the good ole USA
via Chicago.

25:27.095 --> 25:29.512
And, uh,
they got involved with
the Chicago mob

25:29.512 --> 25:30.929
and they sent them out here

25:30.929 --> 25:32.887
to kind of open up
new territory.

25:32.887 --> 25:35.512
Max, these guys
are ice cold killers.

25:35.512 --> 25:37.929
Yeah, so if you're
gonna take them on,

25:37.929 --> 25:41.887
make sure you don't try
bringing a knife to a gun fight.

25:41.887 --> 25:43.678
Max, you do still own a gun?

25:43.678 --> 25:46.303
No one really needs a gun

25:46.303 --> 25:48.595
until he really needs a gun.

26:03.762 --> 26:05.470
[cell phone on vibrate]

26:08.136 --> 26:09.720
Hi, Max.

26:09.720 --> 26:11.929
I've done things,

26:11.929 --> 26:13.428
things I'm not proud of.

26:13.428 --> 26:15.345
I know.

26:15.345 --> 26:17.345
But when I'm with you,

26:17.345 --> 26:19.428
all those memories
are wiped clean.

26:19.428 --> 26:22.720
What exactly are you trying
to say to me, Max?

26:22.720 --> 26:24.512
I'm saying
I wanna be with you

26:24.512 --> 26:25.929
all the time.

26:25.929 --> 26:28.261
So then ask me.

26:30.345 --> 26:32.887
Max, ask me.

26:32.887 --> 26:35.762
Sara...

26:35.762 --> 26:38.011
Sara, will you marry me?

26:39.094 --> 26:41.845
Yes.

26:41.845 --> 26:44.095
Yes.

26:44.095 --> 26:45.303
Yes, Max,

26:45.303 --> 26:48.261
I will marry you.

26:50.637 --> 26:53.762
You have just made me
the happiest girl in World.

26:53.762 --> 26:55.220
You made
the right choice,
you know?

26:55.220 --> 26:56.428
Oh, I know.

26:56.428 --> 26:58.261
I made the right choice, too.

26:59.887 --> 27:02.512
I'm just so stunned.
I, um...

27:02.512 --> 27:05.011
- When can I see you?
- A few hours.

27:05.011 --> 27:06.345
I'll be ready.

27:13.428 --> 27:14.845
Buck up, bucko.

27:14.845 --> 27:17.011
It's not your first rodeo.

27:35.220 --> 27:37.595
- Hurry, we'll go this way.
- No, no I can't go anymore.

27:37.595 --> 27:39.470
Come on, all the way.

27:39.470 --> 27:41.386
[screeching]

27:51.595 --> 27:53.595
Jess-- Jessica?

27:53.595 --> 27:55.386
Jessica!

27:57.762 --> 27:59.220
Jessica!

28:00.386 --> 28:01.762
Jessica!

28:05.261 --> 28:07.053
Jessica!

28:37.428 --> 28:39.844
Wow, I never thought
I'd see you again.

28:39.844 --> 28:41.386
I thought you were out
of the game, James.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.178
- Who's James?
- Ah, I call everybody James.

28:44.178 --> 28:46.178
You don't like James?
I'll call you Jones.

28:46.178 --> 28:48.178
- Makes no never mind to me.
- James will do.

28:48.178 --> 28:50.178
Ah, let me guess.

28:50.178 --> 28:52.303
Somebody's gone
and done you wrong,
haven't they?

28:52.303 --> 28:53.678
Oh yeah,
you could say that.

28:53.678 --> 28:56.470
And let me guess again.

28:56.470 --> 28:59.220
These boys
don't know they got a tiger
by the tail, do they?

28:59.220 --> 29:01.220
Yeah, you probably
acted all innocent like,

29:01.220 --> 29:02.844
they thought
they was playing you,

29:02.844 --> 29:04.928
when all the while,
you were playing them.

29:04.928 --> 29:06.386
Am I right or am I right?

29:06.386 --> 29:08.386
Must be all the drugs
you're taking.

29:08.386 --> 29:10.637
You still funny, man.

29:10.637 --> 29:12.261
Yeah, they don't know
you got a scorched earth,

29:12.261 --> 29:14.637
take no prisoners policy,
do they?

29:14.637 --> 29:16.637
Maybe that was me
in a past life.

29:16.637 --> 29:19.053
Hah, you are still funny.

29:19.053 --> 29:21.720
Yeah, but I'm not
in that reincarnation game.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.928
Drugs, you got that right,

29:23.928 --> 29:25.761
but no reincarnation for me.

29:25.761 --> 29:27.386
I got one life to live,

29:27.386 --> 29:30.011
I'm gonna live it well
and straight to hell.

29:30.011 --> 29:32.928
Well, let's get down
to business James.

29:32.928 --> 29:34.928
You remember
how to use one of these?

29:34.928 --> 29:37.928
- Pump, point, shoot.
- Mm-hmm.

29:37.928 --> 29:39.553
That baby'll hold eight shells,

29:39.553 --> 29:41.136
and you probably won't
have time to reload

29:41.136 --> 29:42.761
spray pattern
should be large enough,

29:42.761 --> 29:44.637
so poor aim
from being rusty and all

29:44.637 --> 29:46.220
shouldn't be too much
of a hindrance for you.

29:46.220 --> 29:49.220
I had a BB gun as a boy.
Does that count?

29:49.220 --> 29:51.053
Being a boy
or having a BB gun?

Shoot, James,
you forget we have got history.

29:53.094 --> 29:55.303

29:55.303 --> 29:57.720

and a coat hanger.

Well, now that baby,
that'll put a second hole
and a rhino's ass.

make it out of live,

that all roads lead

30:12.011 --> 30:13.428

You may be right.

30:28.928 --> 30:31.928
- How much?
- Well, go ahead,
make my night.

30:31.928 --> 30:34.969
It's been a long time.
I don't have a clue what
you charge me.

34:42.886 --> 34:47.303
that it was the humble,
solitary wasp

34:47.303 --> 34:49.969
that pollinated
the first flowers?

34:49.969 --> 34:53.886
And the bees get all the credit.
Imagine that.

The modern bee

01:11:24.759 --> 01:11:26.675
Would you be my knight
in shining armor?

01:12:18.509 --> 01:12:20.300
Hammer Time.

01:12:28.092 --> 01:12:29.884
Sara:
Max?

01:12:31.258 --> 01:12:33.592
Max?

01:12:33.592 --> 01:12:35.134
Sara?

01:12:35.134 --> 01:12:36.509
Sara:
Max!

01:12:36.509 --> 01:12:37.509
Max, untie me!

01:12:39.509 --> 01:12:43.093
Today is the first day
of the rest of our days

01:12:43.093 --> 01:12:45.092
for we are coming back

01:12:45.092 --> 01:12:48.134
from the brink of oblivion

01:12:48.134 --> 01:12:52.092
and we have the enemy
on the run.

01:12:52.092 --> 01:12:53.926
Water.

01:12:53.926 --> 01:12:57.759
The most simple and blessed
example of our earth's abundance

01:12:57.759 --> 01:13:00.342
is leading the way.

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:03.175
The oceanic coasts
are tremendously overwhelmed

01:13:03.175 --> 01:13:06.509
with the flow of our people.

01:13:06.509 --> 01:13:09.801
So please,

01:13:09.801 --> 01:13:13.051
choose more simple
H2O source

01:13:13.051 --> 01:13:15.425
to go to.

01:13:15.425 --> 01:13:18.217
A stream,

01:13:18.217 --> 01:13:19.801
a river,

01:13:19.801 --> 01:13:23.217
or a pond.

01:13:23.217 --> 01:13:25.217
Will do nicely.

01:13:54.509 --> 01:13:59.509
It is a new beginning
and a new order, I guess.

01:13:59.509 --> 01:14:02.884
We do not know
how long it will be before
we write our ship.

01:14:02.884 --> 01:14:05.300
Before the foreseeable future,
folks,

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:08.133
we have returned
to the bartering system.

01:14:08.133 --> 01:14:09.675
And once more,

01:14:09.675 --> 01:14:13.592
gold and silver are kings.

01:14:13.592 --> 01:14:16.801
