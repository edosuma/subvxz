00:29.360 --> 00:32.980
The day me and my family
came to the village

00:33.080 --> 00:37.100
was the summer of the last year
of the First World War.

00:37.200 --> 00:43.620
Heat oozed from the ground and snow clouds
of elder blossom banked in the sky.

00:43.720 --> 00:48.820
The chatter of haymakers drifted
on waves of air from the fields

00:48.920 --> 00:55.420
humming with blundering bees
and flickering with scarlet butterflies.

00:55.520 --> 00:56.799
Morning!

01:32.200 --> 01:34.940
Just look at this place!

01:35.040 --> 01:38.580
What'd I tell you Doth, Marge,
innit something?

01:38.680 --> 01:40.279
Beautiful, ma!

01:44.400 --> 01:47.460
- It's glorious!
- See, didn't I tell you?

01:47.560 --> 01:50.319
We got veggies, look, we got veggies!

01:53.080 --> 01:55.479
Look at this! Didn't I tell you?

01:57.320 --> 01:59.239
I can't pick you up, my love.

02:07.480 --> 02:09.380
My first memories

02:09.479 --> 02:15.220
are of being washed up
in this strange new land, dizzy with scent

02:15.320 --> 02:20.380
and burnt all over
with hot, white flowers.

02:20.480 --> 02:24.079
Look, we got strawberries here!

02:25.120 --> 02:28.599
Oh, look at this place,
Reg is gonna love it...

02:34.480 --> 02:36.860
Loll?

02:36.960 --> 02:39.959
Loll? Come and get some strawberries.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.900
Marge, he's not here.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.700
Oh, he's gone a-wanderin'.

02:45.800 --> 02:50.679
Loll?

02:54.880 --> 02:56.319
There you are.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.740
The world was a miracle to me.

02:59.840 --> 03:04.439
And one day I would record what I'd seen
so that others could see it too.

03:05.480 --> 03:09.039
Before it was lost and gone forever.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.559
Now you go away...

03:16.320 --> 03:19.260
Oh, I want the place
filled with flowers.

03:19.360 --> 03:22.460
You can make a posy here.

03:22.560 --> 03:27.199
<i>As I was a-walkin' for my recreation...</i>

03:28.000 --> 03:31.940
The eldest were my father's
of another marriage

03:32.040 --> 03:35.660
Marge, Doth and Phyl.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.580
These half-sisters I cherished.

03:38.680 --> 03:43.820
And my mother cared for the halves
just as much as she did for the wholes.

03:43.920 --> 03:49.119
Me, my brother Jack
and my sister Frances.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.759
Reg, where'd I put him?

03:53.080 --> 03:55.780
- Is he there? You got him?
- Yeah. Yeah.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.319
Safe and sound.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.060
Pride of place.

03:59.160 --> 04:04.340
My father was away in London,
working in the war office.

04:04.440 --> 04:09.439
His picture was the only thing
I'd seen of him since I was 3.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.839
Home.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.279
Hello darling.

04:41.160 --> 04:44.199
- How is everyone?
- How are you?

04:45.480 --> 04:48.519
- You behaving yourself?
- I've not broken nothing.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.559
Good boy.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.540
What's everybody up to?

04:54.640 --> 04:56.900
Marge is out in the yard.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.460
- Doth is peeling spuds.
- What about the others?

05:00.560 --> 05:05.439
Frances is cleaning her trolley
and Phyl is sitting on the steps.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.620
What about our Loll?

05:07.720 --> 05:10.460
Loll is dead, turned yellow.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.159
Mrs Moores is laying him out.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.399
Loll's dead?

05:19.400 --> 05:22.580
- What are you doing?
- Poor boy he's gone, fled to the angels.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.540
I was getting him ready for the box.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.780
No, Loll ain't dead,
our Loll ain't dead, no, no.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.780
Doth, go and mind the baby.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.279
Marge, go and get the vicar. Now!

05:30.920 --> 05:33.020
And send to Stroud for the doctor.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.340
Get me some blankets.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.879
Oh, Loll, oh, my darling...

05:59.720 --> 06:01.479
Please, hurry!

06:04.720 --> 06:06.919
Please, please!

06:07.160 --> 06:08.519
Please!

06:10.240 --> 06:13.260
In the name of God,
and trusting in his might alone

06:13.360 --> 06:16.340
receive Christ's healing touch
to make you whole.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.954
May Christ bring you wholeness of body,

06:18.054 --> 06:19.539
- mind and spirit.
- My darling...

06:19.640 --> 06:21.088
Deliver you from every evil

06:21.188 --> 06:26.063
- and bring you peace. Amen.
- My darling... my darling. Amen.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.380
I came close to death.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.940
But somehow, I clung on.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.919
Though it was a very near thing.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.719
A very near thing indeed.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.159
See?

06:44.040 --> 06:45.639
She's coming!

06:54.880 --> 07:00.319
My sister Frances
was a beautiful, fragile child.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.500
Come on.

07:02.600 --> 07:06.959
We were full of mischief
and as thick as thieves.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.980
Think she'll be a while!

07:19.080 --> 07:20.999
Here it is.

07:26.680 --> 07:33.980
"A murdered cadaver
will be shockingly uncovered."

07:34.080 --> 07:36.500
What's a cadaver?

07:36.600 --> 07:40.224
I think it's a kind of bird...

07:47.040 --> 07:49.039
Varmints been in again.

07:50.840 --> 07:55.060
Our two old neighbours
who were rival ancients.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.999
Her up atop we called Granny Trill.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.319
Keep it down, you great crow!

08:03.880 --> 08:06.959
And her down under was Granny Wallen.

08:10.560 --> 08:14.119
You keep it down up there,
you great boar!

08:21.360 --> 08:23.279
Miserable old trout.

08:31.160 --> 08:34.399
We had a feeling
that the summer would never end.

08:35.320 --> 08:37.500
Little varmints.

08:37.600 --> 08:42.539
All sights twice brilliant
and smells twice sharp.

08:42.640 --> 08:46.719
- Come on!
- All games twice as long.

08:48.480 --> 08:52.740
It seemed that here
no disasters could happen.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.879
That nothing could ever touch us.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.719
Never been as bad as this before.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.879
It's cruel. Poor little mite.

09:23.760 --> 09:27.599
Don't you fret, he always fights back.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.239
Come now.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.479
Let's leave him be.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.919
I will make sure you're alright, Loll.

10:25.760 --> 10:28.420
As I lay in my bed

10:28.520 --> 10:33.940
I could sense the whole valley
by the surfaces of my skin.

10:34.040 --> 10:38.580
The turn of the hour,
the set of the year.

10:38.680 --> 10:42.719
The weather and all the life to come.

10:47.680 --> 10:51.540
I was made one with the valley.

10:51.640 --> 10:55.140
So that I felt part of its destination.

10:55.240 --> 10:59.780
Washed of my fever, ice cold, but alive.

10:59.880 --> 11:04.239
It seemed I would never lose it again.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.119
Loll?

11:22.680 --> 11:24.119
Hey darling.

11:30.240 --> 11:34.079
I've cut you, look, some lovely
thin bread and butter to go with it.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.820
Tummy ache...

11:41.920 --> 11:44.639
Oh, darling, that's because
you haven't eaten in a week.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.300
Look, just don't eat it too fast

11:47.400 --> 11:50.079
cos you'll make yourself sick.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.919
Hey, I'm gonna walk
into Stroud later on.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.959
Gonna buy you a paint box.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.540
Maybe some liquorice.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.639
Would you like that?

12:06.280 --> 12:08.359
Everyone's been asking about you.

12:08.600 --> 12:09.879
Fancy that.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.719
Where's Frances?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.679
We buried her yesterday.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.679
Cos of me?

12:33.080 --> 12:35.399
No, darling, no.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.140
No, you mustn't think that, you mustn't.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.879
Understand me?

12:49.280 --> 12:50.799
I'm sorry.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.100
Frances died suddenly.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.940
Silently.

13:13.040 --> 13:16.380
Hers was a death
that should never have happened

13:16.480 --> 13:19.439
like so many children at the time.

13:20.520 --> 13:23.919
I've always believed
she gave me her life.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.319
Something so precious,
I would live it to the full.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.159
For both of us.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.620
Stop messing me!

13:35.720 --> 13:37.180
Give over, Loll.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.060
Doth, pass us Jack's old jumper.

13:39.160 --> 13:40.500
Oi, that's mine!

13:40.600 --> 13:42.519
It's more holes than jumper anyway.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.119
Marge, he's here again.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.500
I knew all about war.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.900
My ears from birth
had been full of the talk of it.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.140
This man did not look like a soldier.

14:03.240 --> 14:08.620
He was not brass-soled, leather-belted
and wax-whiskered like my father.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.260
- Tell me all about it.
- Shh!

14:10.360 --> 14:11.839
Don't really know where to start.

14:12.760 --> 14:15.239
Well, the mud's a foot deeper
at the bottom of the trenches.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.639
Shells crashing down on you from above.

14:20.440 --> 14:24.260
And you can hear the bullets snap
and crack past your ears like a whip.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.820
You oughtn't to be in the woods.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.679
- You ought to be at home.
- I wouldn't do.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.679
They'd jump on you
before you could say "knife".

14:33.160 --> 14:35.959
- Hey, Jack...
- You got me!

14:37.520 --> 14:39.100
He's alright.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.839
Are you a soldier?

14:42.200 --> 14:44.599
I'm a solider, aye.

14:44.920 --> 14:47.300
And you'd make a better
soldier than me any day.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.900
Would you like some more tea?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.820
- Um, I've still got half a mug.
- Alright.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.639
How's the war in the wood?

14:55.960 --> 14:57.399
Have you lost it?

14:59.400 --> 15:01.359
I'm doing my best not to.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.260
You see my daddy's
a soldier fighting the war.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.500
Not much fighting going on in London.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.119
He's doing his bit
for the country. For all of us.

15:12.920 --> 15:17.399
I tell you what, if I see your old man
I'll tell him you said hello.

15:19.360 --> 15:22.020
And uh, I'd best be off.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.660
You can stay a bit longer.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.719
That's kind of you to offer.

15:31.560 --> 15:33.919
Why are you staring?

15:38.040 --> 15:40.740
I best be going,
I don't wanna get you in no trouble.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.300
You mind yourself.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.639
- Thank you.
- Take care. Marge?

15:48.600 --> 15:50.780
- Poor lad.
- Goodbye.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.500
No good'll come of it.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.319
Come on, let's go!

15:55.600 --> 15:57.719
Is that alright? Arms out.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.959
- There we go, take your tater.
- What's going on?

16:01.480 --> 16:02.900
You're starting school today.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.580
- No I ain't, I'm stopping home.
- No, you're going to school.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.700
Come on Loll, you're a big boy now!

16:07.800 --> 16:10.220
- Don't wanna be!
- Don't be silly.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.479
Marge, Doth.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.159
- See you.
- Bye!

16:13.800 --> 16:15.439
Gerroff!

16:24.160 --> 16:26.079
I don't wanna go to school!

16:30.840 --> 16:32.039
- Bye!
- Bye.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.439
- Come on, Loll, we got work.
- Go on, we'll be late.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.999
- Let's go.
- Go on!

16:40.560 --> 16:42.940
It was my first amazed vision
of any world

16:43.040 --> 16:46.839
outside the womanly warmth of my family.

16:47.560 --> 16:50.439
I didn't expect to survive it for long.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.959
Look in his pocket.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.660
- It's a tater.
- Give it here.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.239
Why've you got a tater?

17:04.760 --> 17:07.118
I got his cap!

17:15.000 --> 17:16.740
Good morning, children.

17:16.839 --> 17:21.919
Good morning, Miss Buckley.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.060
Who we got here, then?

17:28.160 --> 17:30.020
- Laurie Lee.
- Well, Laurie

17:30.120 --> 17:33.519
how about you sit over there
for the present?

17:36.680 --> 17:40.340
My desk companions were two girls

17:40.440 --> 17:44.020
already puppishly pretty.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.980
Jo Jenkins...

17:46.080 --> 17:48.660
When do we get the present?

17:48.760 --> 17:51.620
And Rosie Burdock.

17:51.720 --> 17:54.500
Jack Lee, don't be
laughing at your brother.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.700
Now children, hands together.

17:56.800 --> 18:01.079
They were to distract
and haunt me for the next 10 years.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.599
Hands together, Spadge Hopkins.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.140
Our Father

18:07.240 --> 18:09.860
who art in heaven

18:09.960 --> 18:12.300
hallowed be thy name.

18:12.400 --> 18:15.460
Thy kingdom come

18:15.560 --> 18:18.060
thy will be done

18:18.160 --> 18:22.460
on earth, as it is in heaven.

18:22.560 --> 18:26.420
Give us this day, our daily bread...

18:26.520 --> 18:32.279
The first and last years of school
reside most vividly in the memory.

18:32.960 --> 18:35.599
We entered the door marked "Infants"

18:36.600 --> 18:40.500
moved gradually through the years

18:40.600 --> 18:45.140
'til we were ready
to be handed back to the world.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.980
...hallowed be thy name.

18:48.080 --> 18:52.020
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

18:52.120 --> 18:55.260
on Earth, as it is in heaven.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.020
Give us this day our daily bread

18:58.120 --> 19:01.460
and forgive us our trespasses

19:01.560 --> 19:05.119
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

19:05.880 --> 19:10.700
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

19:10.800 --> 19:16.140
Divine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory.

19:16.240 --> 19:20.020
For ever and ever. Amen.

19:20.120 --> 19:23.719
Joseph's pond's frozen!

19:25.400 --> 19:27.380
Come on Loll, you snail!

19:27.480 --> 19:29.279
Wait for me!

20:01.960 --> 20:03.660
Come on Loll, quicker.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.580
- Whoa!
- Careful Loll, mind yourself!

20:05.680 --> 20:07.500
Timber!

20:07.600 --> 20:10.380
Shove off, Rosie Burdock,
you be careful on this ice

20:10.480 --> 20:12.580
you'll crack her underneath,
great big heifer.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.620
You come over here and say that,
I'll box your ears.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.140
Like to see you try.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.959
Getting the hang of this skating lark.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.740
Jo!

20:21.840 --> 20:23.559
Didn't know you could skate, Loll!

20:25.400 --> 20:27.100
Jo, watch this!

20:27.200 --> 20:28.620
Look at him, showing off!

20:28.720 --> 20:30.519
Loll, careful,
you don't wanna break nothing.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.519
Jo, watch this then.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.740
Don't say I didn't warn you.

20:36.840 --> 20:37.940
Ah!

20:38.040 --> 20:39.119
Man down!

20:41.360 --> 20:42.940
You alright there, Rosie?

20:43.040 --> 20:44.140
"Great big heifer"?

20:44.240 --> 20:46.079
Meant it in a nice way, like.

20:54.760 --> 20:58.420
We were all afraid
of the goblin, Miss B.

20:58.520 --> 21:01.060
4 goes into 2 how many times, class?

21:01.160 --> 21:06.319
She was a terror.
We christened her Crabby.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.660
No times, it's 0.

21:08.760 --> 21:09.919
Dullards.

21:11.240 --> 21:14.159
Carry the 2 to the next column,
making... class?

21:15.800 --> 21:17.580
How many does it make?

21:17.680 --> 21:19.060
If you carry the 2?

21:19.160 --> 21:20.439
Class?

21:22.000 --> 21:22.940
26.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.719
It makes 26.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.700
Nothing but straw between their ears.

21:27.800 --> 21:31.559
2 and 6 makes 26!

21:32.160 --> 21:33.860
Waste of bloomin' time...

21:33.960 --> 21:35.279
Ah!

21:38.360 --> 21:39.380
Lee.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.020
What's that you got?

21:41.120 --> 21:42.599
Give it here.

21:43.360 --> 21:46.119
You'll only earn yourself more strokes.

21:49.040 --> 21:53.559
"The old red tree strew arches above us
making tunnels of rusty darkness."

21:56.280 --> 21:58.399
"You, like a slip of yew."

21:59.760 --> 22:02.500
"You, like a slip of yew",
what is this grubbiness?

22:02.600 --> 22:03.820
Poem, miss.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.719
- It's for his sweetheart.
- Shut up!

22:07.360 --> 22:10.100
I will not have this kind
of talk in my classroom.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.079
What have you got to say for yourself?

22:20.760 --> 22:23.039
It's my aunt, miss.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.399
What about it, Jack?

22:27.400 --> 22:30.599
I uh... I never got on with her.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.980
Well, best get on, then.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.580
Oh, but miss, she's my cousin!

22:36.680 --> 22:38.039
Mine too!

22:39.640 --> 22:41.700
Wait, where do you think you're going?
Where do you think you're going?

22:41.800 --> 22:44.199
Come back here, come back here!

22:51.520 --> 22:55.100
We would do anything
to get out of lessons.

22:55.200 --> 22:58.940
Many a lone coffin
was followed to its grave

22:59.040 --> 23:02.279
by a straggle of long-faced children.

23:03.520 --> 23:06.439
All strangers to the bereaved.

23:15.880 --> 23:18.519
Memories mark you.

23:19.280 --> 23:23.540
Moments in time to cast
a shadow over your life

23:23.640 --> 23:26.460
and change it forever.

23:26.560 --> 23:30.620
Remembering is to relive.

23:30.720 --> 23:35.159
To be in the same moment all over again.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.500
What you doing, ma?

24:02.600 --> 24:04.439
I'm doing my scrapbook, Loll.

24:05.720 --> 24:08.159
- How was school?
- Alright.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.799
Where you off to?
I wanna hear all about school.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.719
Loll? What you up to.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.540
Aw, look at you.

24:24.640 --> 24:26.420
I'm a soldier

24:26.520 --> 24:27.959
like pa.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.399
I can see that.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.079
And a fine one you are, too.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.580
But I think you're missing something.

24:36.680 --> 24:39.399
Every soldier needs his rifle, see?

24:55.720 --> 24:58.439
Pow, pow!

25:10.280 --> 25:12.079
He's in here somewhere.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.959
Shh, shh!

25:40.440 --> 25:41.719
Shh!

25:50.480 --> 25:52.799
It's alright, I'm not gonna hurt you.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.519
That were close.

26:09.120 --> 26:10.740
You ain't got no doors.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.460
Got no walls, neither.

26:12.560 --> 26:15.919
Set yourself down next to the fire,
get the heat back in your bones.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.020
You mustn't tell no-one
you saw this place.

26:25.120 --> 26:27.679
The Hun's got spies everywhere,
do you understand?

26:28.800 --> 26:29.959
Good lad.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.119
- It's Laurie, ain't it?
- Loll.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.199
James Harris. Private, First Class.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.879
Why does your hand shake?

26:39.960 --> 26:41.940
It's just the cold.

26:42.040 --> 26:44.039
The wind blowing in my bones.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.439
Looking for someone?

26:57.520 --> 27:00.540
Loll? What are you doing out here?

27:00.640 --> 27:03.719
There was Hun soldiers,
we hid from them.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.740
He ain't got no doors.

27:06.840 --> 27:08.759
Can't get no privacy.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.239
His name's James.

27:11.800 --> 27:12.999
Is it?

27:13.720 --> 27:17.060
Well, you're in luck, James.
I happen to have some food

27:17.160 --> 27:19.039
clothes here you can have.

27:19.720 --> 27:20.919
Thank you.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.439
We was playing, weren't we Loll?

27:25.160 --> 27:27.620
- Pow!
- Ah, you got me!

27:27.720 --> 27:29.079
You got me.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.559
We'd better be off.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.300
Say goodbye to James.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.479
Bye, James.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.839
You take care, you hear?

28:03.600 --> 28:06.620
We were green and innocent.

28:06.720 --> 28:10.199
Not fully understanding what we did.

28:10.840 --> 28:14.860
Imitating the rituals and roles
that had played out before us.

28:14.960 --> 28:18.740
Was Archduke Franz Ferdinand
assassinated, class?

28:18.840 --> 28:21.159
In which country? Class?

28:21.960 --> 28:23.380
Ow!

28:23.480 --> 28:25.260
What do you think you're doing?

28:25.360 --> 28:27.940
Spadge Hopkins, sit up straight.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.780
This is as straight as I get.

28:29.880 --> 28:32.620
And you can settle down, Miss Burdock.
Hopkins, sit up, now!

28:32.720 --> 28:34.279
I am, miss.

28:35.320 --> 28:40.940
Tell us, which city Archduke
Franz Ferdinand was assassinated?

28:41.040 --> 28:42.599
Sarajevo.

28:43.520 --> 28:44.900
Dunno.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.159
London?

28:51.480 --> 28:53.079
Sarajevo.

28:54.440 --> 28:58.599
And why was this act of aggression
such an important moment?

28:59.400 --> 29:02.159
Well... he was dead.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.540
That was important for him, I s'pose.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.719
And for the rest of us?

29:09.280 --> 29:11.740
- Come on, pudding head!
- You better watch it...

29:11.840 --> 29:13.519
What can you tell us?

29:14.160 --> 29:15.199
Nothing.

29:15.960 --> 29:17.820
Cos you don't know nothing!

29:17.920 --> 29:21.039
You're a great, slouching know-nothing!

29:22.040 --> 29:23.239
Sod it all!

29:23.920 --> 29:26.060
- Where are you going, young man?
- It's not any business of yours.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.900
No, get back in your chair this instant,
I won't have it!

29:29.000 --> 29:32.359
- Ta-ra.
- No, I won't have it, you're going nowhere.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.999
Put me down! You put me down!

29:39.480 --> 29:41.980
Help me get down,
someone help me get down!

29:42.080 --> 29:44.380
Three cheers for Spadge Hopkins!

29:44.480 --> 29:45.460
Stop that!

29:45.560 --> 29:46.980
Get me down!

29:47.080 --> 29:48.900
Stop that, I won't have it!

29:49.000 --> 29:51.639
I won't have it!

30:08.360 --> 30:12.340
"Oh, all the woods and the meadows"

30:12.440 --> 30:15.500
"woods where we hid from the wet."

30:15.600 --> 30:18.460
"stiles where we stayed to be kind."

30:18.560 --> 30:21.020
"Meadows in which we met."

30:21.120 --> 30:26.180
"Light so low in the veil,
you flash and lighten afar."

30:26.280 --> 30:32.119
"For this is the golden morning of love
and you are his morning star."

30:32.840 --> 30:37.860
"Flash, I am coming, I come by meadow
and stile and wood."

30:37.960 --> 30:40.660
"Oh, lighten into my eyes and my heart"

30:40.760 --> 30:43.180
"and into my heart and my blood."

30:43.280 --> 30:47.700
"Heart are you great enough
for a love that never tires?"

30:47.800 --> 30:49.900
"Oh, heart, are you
great enough for love?"

30:50.000 --> 30:52.580
"I have heard of thorns and briars."

30:52.680 --> 30:56.100
"Over the thorns and briars,
over the meadows and stiles"

30:56.200 --> 30:58.580
"Over the world to the end of it"

30:58.680 --> 31:01.479
"flash of a million miles."

31:02.840 --> 31:04.340
What was that all about?

31:04.440 --> 31:06.260
What do you think?

31:06.360 --> 31:07.740
Love and that.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.300
The kind that goes on and on.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.359
Nothing lasts forever.

31:11.840 --> 31:13.100
Well, it don't.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.519
What about you and Jo?

31:15.040 --> 31:16.020
Oh, shut up!

31:16.120 --> 31:17.580
Not Jo Jenkins?

31:17.680 --> 31:18.900
Look at his blushing!

31:19.000 --> 31:20.420
She ain't nothing or no-one!

31:20.520 --> 31:23.060
- He's been pining for her!
- Ey Jack, now leave him be.

31:23.160 --> 31:26.260
'Jo I love you, Jo I wanna marry you!'

31:26.360 --> 31:28.020
I told you to shut up!

31:28.120 --> 31:29.580
Get off me, get off me!

31:29.680 --> 31:31.199
Pull 'em apart,
before they break something!

31:32.760 --> 31:35.679
- Stop it, stop it now!
- Stop it, pa might arrive any minute.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.700
That's enough.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.719
Stand up, the pair of you.

31:44.960 --> 31:47.700
What will your father think if he
comes home and finds you like this?

31:47.800 --> 31:50.119
He'll think we've descended
into anarchy.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.399
Now go upstairs, the pair of you.

32:04.720 --> 32:07.380
The war had ended long ago

32:07.480 --> 32:11.039
but our father still had not
returned to live with us.

32:12.440 --> 32:14.199
Are you gonna play that for your dad?

32:14.480 --> 32:15.780
If he likes.

32:15.880 --> 32:17.999
Of course he will. Lovely, it is.

32:19.080 --> 32:20.399
It is?

32:20.800 --> 32:22.180
What time did he say?

32:22.280 --> 32:24.940
There was the occasional
promise of a visit

32:25.040 --> 32:27.820
and each time we attended dutifully

32:27.920 --> 32:29.860
lest we shake out mother's faith.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.100
Oh, he says he's bringing home
a whole leg of lamb!

32:32.200 --> 32:35.639
We'll have a time of it tonight,
it'll be lovely.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.860
Loll I, I think that's enough
practising for now.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.439
- I ain't finished, yet.
- No but I, I think that's enough.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.079
Loll!

32:56.720 --> 32:58.879
- Telegram, ma'am.
- Thank you.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.759
He's been kept back in London.

33:20.280 --> 33:22.639
But he sends his best to you all.

33:55.240 --> 33:58.639
A serious drought hit the country.

33:59.720 --> 34:03.719
Springs dried up,
wells filled with frogs.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.380
Trees shrivelled.

34:06.480 --> 34:09.420
Crops burned in the fields.

34:09.520 --> 34:13.399
Small, naked winds blew over our faces.

34:14.360 --> 34:17.860
Dandelion seeds floated by.

34:17.960 --> 34:22.940
Burnt sap and roast nettles
tingled our nostrils.

34:23.040 --> 34:28.940
Together with the dull rust smell
of dry ground.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.559
There's none coming, ma!

34:32.960 --> 34:35.559
Oh, Loll, darling, come here.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.958
Doth, get some mud, my love.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.518
Well, we haven't got much, have we?

34:44.239 --> 34:46.780
Right then. Right, come on then.

34:46.880 --> 34:50.460
- Here you are missus, try this'n for size!
- Granny Wallen!

34:50.560 --> 34:53.659
It's the first of my last year's
cowslip wine.

34:53.760 --> 34:55.380
Oh, you don't me giving 'em
too much though, Granny Wallen

34:55.480 --> 34:57.100
cos they'll have a funny turn.

34:57.200 --> 35:00.100
Conduct yourselves with some dignity

35:00.200 --> 35:02.740
else you shan't be getting nothing!

35:02.840 --> 35:05.919
You'd think you'd learned your manners
from her up atop!

35:08.520 --> 35:11.340
Ooh, did you hear him, missus?

35:11.440 --> 35:13.580
The screech bird?

35:13.680 --> 35:15.820
Last night it was.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.340
And the night before that.

35:18.440 --> 35:20.860
Ooh, I can't say I did, Granny Wallen.

35:20.960 --> 35:24.100
You mark my words, her up atop is going.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.940
You mark my words,
this heat will have her.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.180
Is there something wrong with her?

35:29.280 --> 35:32.079
Not a lot right,
that's for certain! Haha!

35:32.640 --> 35:34.820
Here, don't look so sour, you.

35:34.920 --> 35:38.319
You're so worried, run this up to her.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.220
That you again, varmint?

35:53.320 --> 35:55.180
I've come on a visit.

35:55.280 --> 35:58.340
Well, you just mind my pots,
or I'll cut you to pieces.

35:58.440 --> 35:59.740
Brought you some wine.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.700
From her down under?

36:01.800 --> 36:03.740
Poison, it'll be.

36:03.840 --> 36:05.279
No it ain't.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.620
It's awful stuff!

36:15.720 --> 36:18.420
- I'll take it back, then.
- No, no, no.

36:18.520 --> 36:21.279
I'll take it. Might make use of it.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.919
Scouring the pots.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.700
You going bald?

36:28.800 --> 36:31.660
Bald!? Never!

36:31.760 --> 36:34.100
I've got my bits.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.519
Look at the dead stuff
dropping off your comb.

36:37.080 --> 36:39.180
That's healthy, that is.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.919
Just making room for more.

36:45.480 --> 36:47.079
Her down under...

36:47.880 --> 36:49.759
...I got more than her!

36:54.200 --> 36:57.319
Her's as bald as a tater root!

37:04.280 --> 37:06.719
Wicked old lump.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.319
I'll see her gone.

37:11.600 --> 37:15.519
Her's failing, you mark my words.

37:16.520 --> 37:17.980
Right lads, up the hill.

37:18.080 --> 37:19.940
There's soldiers!

37:20.040 --> 37:22.479
Left, right, left...

37:45.080 --> 37:47.460
soldiers with rifles

37:47.560 --> 37:52.559
marched to the top of the hills
and began shooting at passing clouds...

37:54.240 --> 37:55.820
Fire!

37:55.920 --> 38:00.260
...hoping that bursting them
might bring rain.

38:00.360 --> 38:01.199
Aim...

38:02.480 --> 38:04.119
Fire!

38:04.960 --> 38:07.420
Don't get too close, Loll!

38:07.520 --> 38:10.540
Has Marge gone to see
the soldier in the woods?

38:10.640 --> 38:12.340
Shh, come on.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.420
Fire!

38:14.520 --> 38:16.199
Reload!

38:19.240 --> 38:24.159
Whether from prayers, or shooting,
or the simple return of nature

38:25.000 --> 38:27.799
the drought broke soon after.

38:28.920 --> 38:33.279
And it began to rain
as it never rained before.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.639
Sweet saints above!

38:40.080 --> 38:41.820
It's coming in!

38:41.920 --> 38:44.700
Bring brooms, it's coming in!

38:44.800 --> 38:47.479
Stop it! Doth! Marge! Get the boys!

38:48.000 --> 38:49.580
Sweep it, my darlings!

38:49.680 --> 38:53.399
Sweep it away!

39:47.080 --> 39:48.759
I've got you something.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.039
It's my mum's.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.159
Some of the lads, when we um...

40:01.200 --> 40:05.940
When they go over the top, they give
something away to be remembered by.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.519
But I got you to remember you by.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.100
Loll?

40:34.200 --> 40:36.100
You little sneak, Laurie Lee!

40:36.200 --> 40:38.700
- I never done nothing!
- Oh, come here, you!

40:38.800 --> 40:41.540
- Gerroff!
- What you doing out here, anyway?

40:41.640 --> 40:43.279
Playing soldiers.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.599
Was he trying to hurt you?

40:50.560 --> 40:53.279
- How'd you mean?
- Biting you.

40:54.480 --> 40:57.940
That wasn't... that weren't no bite.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.980
It was a kiss.

41:00.080 --> 41:03.100
Like off ma, when I'm in bed?

41:03.200 --> 41:06.039
I s'pose, a little bit.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.100
When two people like each other a lot

41:10.200 --> 41:12.460
they wanna find a way to show it.

41:12.560 --> 41:14.759
You could just tell him.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.580
Sometimes you might
wanna do more than that.

41:18.680 --> 41:20.420
Get close to someone.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.220
Like ma and pa, you understand?

41:23.320 --> 41:26.020
Is the soldier going away, then?

41:26.120 --> 41:28.020
Why'd you say that?

41:28.120 --> 41:29.839
Pa went away.

41:30.560 --> 41:32.479
James isn't going anywhere.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.380
Can't catch me!

41:34.480 --> 41:37.580
- Loll? Loll, where are you going?
- Can't catch me!

41:37.680 --> 41:39.559
Loll, get back here!

41:40.280 --> 41:42.439
Can't catch me!

41:44.440 --> 41:47.580
- Come back here, Loll!
- Catch me if you can!

41:47.680 --> 41:49.879
Oh, I'll catch you alright...

42:07.320 --> 42:10.820
- So what shall we do now then, Jo?
- I don't mind.

42:10.920 --> 42:13.020
Go on, you tell.

42:13.120 --> 42:14.679
No, you do it.

42:16.760 --> 42:17.959
No.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.159
Do it like before.

42:22.720 --> 42:25.479
What seems to be the trouble then,
Miss Jenkins?

43:04.880 --> 43:08.940
The early exploration of Jo's body

43:09.040 --> 43:12.199
was a solitary studying of maps.

43:13.920 --> 43:18.540
The signs upon her
showed me the way I should go

43:18.640 --> 43:22.559
over flesh smoother than candle's skin.

43:23.640 --> 43:27.279
Like something thrown down
from the moon.

43:28.680 --> 43:30.959
That'll be all, Miss Jenkins.

43:42.560 --> 43:46.079
6 goes into 12... twice.

43:47.200 --> 43:51.399
1 foot, 0.304...

43:51.960 --> 43:56.759
1 inch, 2.54...

43:57.800 --> 43:59.639
Divided by 2...

44:04.520 --> 44:06.519
- Ow...
- What are you doing, Loll?

44:07.280 --> 44:09.039
None of your business!

44:09.720 --> 44:12.839
I'll tell miss you're on your way,
don't wanna miss the test!

44:15.240 --> 44:16.399
Ow!

44:18.360 --> 44:20.460
There will be no talking

44:20.560 --> 44:22.980
no cheating, no peeking.

44:23.080 --> 44:25.359
Spadge Hopkins, I'll be watching you.

44:27.040 --> 44:28.660
What's up with you?

44:28.760 --> 44:32.079
Please miss, I think I got the measles.

44:33.480 --> 44:35.500
Strange it's only on your arms.

44:35.600 --> 44:37.940
- That's nettle rash!
- Shut up, Rosie!

44:38.040 --> 44:40.340
I seen him in the field getting them
so he could miss the test!

44:40.440 --> 44:43.300
Miserable child.

44:43.400 --> 44:44.900
Slow!

44:45.000 --> 44:46.639
And lazy!

44:47.760 --> 44:51.860
Right class, begin test, write your names
on top of the sheet.

44:51.960 --> 44:57.180
Question 1: x over 6+7 = 3 and a half.

44:57.280 --> 44:59.079
What is x?

44:59.640 --> 45:01.079
Move out the way!

45:01.680 --> 45:02.919
Move, move!

45:06.880 --> 45:09.759
- Slow and lazy, can't catch me!
- I'll have ya!

45:18.800 --> 45:21.780
Get off me!

45:21.880 --> 45:24.439
You're a pain in the neck,
Rosie Burdock!

45:26.640 --> 45:28.119
Get off!

45:30.040 --> 45:31.860
- Ow, you're hurting me!
- Good!

45:31.960 --> 45:33.919
Teach you to go biting.

45:34.560 --> 45:36.279
Get off!

45:43.640 --> 45:45.519
You got something
in those shorts of yours.

45:49.720 --> 45:51.319
I don't mind.

45:55.640 --> 45:58.679
You got any wine gums?
I'll show you if you want.

46:02.200 --> 46:03.700
You got any wine gums?

46:03.800 --> 46:05.639
Not for you, I ain't.

46:18.640 --> 46:21.377
Alright there, Loll? Want a lift home?

46:21.477 --> 46:25.060
- Yeah.
- Hop on, then. I been practising.

46:25.160 --> 46:27.220
- Alright there, Rosie?
- Alright.

46:27.320 --> 46:30.279
- How's your ma?
- She's alright Mrs Lee, yeah.

46:31.040 --> 46:32.660
Hold on tight, then.

46:32.760 --> 46:35.399
- Not too fast, mind.
- No, no, no, no.

46:38.960 --> 46:45.340
<i>As I was a-walkin' for my recreation</i>

46:45.440 --> 46:48.100
<i>Down by the green meadows...</i>

46:48.200 --> 46:50.740
That way a little bit, a little bit more.
That's it, that's great.

46:50.840 --> 46:51.759
Margaret...

46:52.240 --> 46:54.420
<i>...There I met a fair maid</i>

46:54.520 --> 46:57.959
<i>Making great lamentation...</i>

47:00.120 --> 47:01.759
Sorry, sorry!

47:04.520 --> 47:06.039
Alright, ladies and gentlemen...

47:06.800 --> 47:13.100
<i>...The blackbirds and thrushes
sing in the green bushes</i>

47:13.200 --> 47:18.919
<i>The lark and the dove
sing in mourn for this maid</i>

47:19.720 --> 47:21.079
Oh!

47:22.240 --> 47:24.900
Ha ha ha, only thing now is stopping!

47:25.000 --> 47:27.980
- You have mended the brakes right, ma?
- No, no, no, no

47:28.080 --> 47:30.420
- but we'll make do, ha ha ha!
- How?

47:30.520 --> 47:33.140
- Ahh!
- Help!

47:33.240 --> 47:35.780
- Ahh!
- Brakes!

47:35.880 --> 47:37.759
Use the brakes!

47:38.280 --> 47:40.180
Help!

47:40.280 --> 47:43.079
Help, help!

47:45.240 --> 47:47.119
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Oh, my gosh, ahh!

47:49.720 --> 47:51.999
- Ahh!
- Alright, Mrs Lee.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.399
Ta, Jerry.

47:55.760 --> 47:57.439
Dearie me...

48:03.560 --> 48:05.679
Why'd you buy that? It's broken.

48:06.280 --> 48:11.060
When I worked up at Galveston Court,
I always dreamed of owning one of these.

48:11.160 --> 48:13.839
And now I got one,
just a bit of glue, it'll be fine.

48:16.120 --> 48:18.519
We can't afford broken china, ma.

48:19.480 --> 48:22.940
So... have you been giving that
Rosie Burdock the run around, then?

48:23.040 --> 48:24.679
Ain't nothing doing.

48:26.480 --> 48:28.700
I remember when you two were little.

48:28.800 --> 48:31.559
You know, you pushed her in a fire.
Weren't burning, of course.

48:32.400 --> 48:33.519
Shame.

48:34.560 --> 48:36.319
The path of true love.

48:38.560 --> 48:40.580
Can I ask you something?

48:40.680 --> 48:42.879
You just did, didn't you?

48:47.560 --> 48:49.119
How'd you meet dad?

48:50.960 --> 48:52.399
Well...

48:54.080 --> 48:56.359
I was working in
your grandad's pub at the time

48:57.520 --> 49:00.340
and there was an advert
in the newspaper, "Widower".

49:00.440 --> 49:03.660
"Four children, seeks housekeeper."

49:03.760 --> 49:05.399
That was it.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.519
I got lucky with his four,
they took to me straight away.

49:12.560 --> 49:15.799
You know, which was hard,
considering they'd just lost their mother.

49:16.680 --> 49:18.599
Good as gold, they were.

49:21.240 --> 49:23.039
And I had Frances.

49:24.680 --> 49:25.959
Jack...

49:26.800 --> 49:29.359
Then you came along, eh?

49:30.400 --> 49:33.239
First four years of us together
was just magic.

49:36.680 --> 49:38.559
I do love him, you know.

49:56.040 --> 49:58.980
The year revolved around the village...

49:59.080 --> 50:03.820
the festivals round the year,
the squire round the festivals

50:03.920 --> 50:06.220
and the village round the squire.

50:06.320 --> 50:08.180
Squire's been good to us this year.

50:08.280 --> 50:09.980
The parochial church tea...

50:10.080 --> 50:12.380
- Loll, don't pick.
- ...an annual entertainment

50:12.480 --> 50:14.260
was his winter treat.

50:14.360 --> 50:17.119
You've practiced enough,
it'll go alright.

50:17.760 --> 50:20.860
You two on tonight then?
Should be good for a laugh.

50:20.960 --> 50:22.639
Leave some for the rest of us!

50:26.840 --> 50:28.919
The parochial church tea

50:31.280 --> 50:33.959
is with us again, I suggest.

50:36.840 --> 50:38.340
Another year.

50:38.440 --> 50:41.039
Another year comes around.

50:42.280 --> 50:46.220
When I see you gathered here, once more

50:46.320 --> 50:49.319
- when I see, when I think...
- Shh!

50:50.280 --> 50:52.039
And here you all are.

50:54.160 --> 50:57.359
It comes to me... friends...

50:59.320 --> 51:00.719
He's lost it!

51:01.240 --> 51:04.439
Stop it! All of you, shh!

51:05.280 --> 51:07.119
Once again...

51:16.920 --> 51:18.140
Thank you, squire

51:18.240 --> 51:22.580
once again for such
a generous feast. Now...

51:22.680 --> 51:25.060
Ah, not yet!

51:25.160 --> 51:27.980
Rosie Burdock, that means you too.

51:28.080 --> 51:31.719
We must wait to say grace.

51:34.880 --> 51:37.700
- Oh, bountiful father...
- Oh, bountiful father...

51:37.800 --> 51:40.159
We thank thee for our daily bread...

51:41.200 --> 51:44.540
May it strengthen and refresh our bodies...

51:44.640 --> 51:47.100
And we pray thee, nourish our souls...

51:47.200 --> 51:49.820
Amen.

51:49.920 --> 51:52.559
- Through Jesus Christ our Lord...
- Pass the cake, Loll.

51:53.160 --> 51:54.879
- ...Amen.
- Amen.

51:57.920 --> 51:59.479
Carry on.

52:00.600 --> 52:03.540
Excuse me, waiter.

52:03.640 --> 52:05.020
Yes ma'am?

52:05.120 --> 52:10.119
What is the meaning
of this fly in my tea?

52:10.800 --> 52:14.679
I wouldn't know...
I'm not a fortune teller.

52:17.040 --> 52:19.980
And my soup tastes funny.

52:20.080 --> 52:22.559
Well, why aren't you laughing then?

52:28.040 --> 52:32.220
Uh, for the next item, ladies and gentlemen,
we have an instrumental duet

52:32.320 --> 52:36.519
by Miss Jenkins and young Laurie Lee.

52:50.520 --> 52:52.439
- Get on with it!
- Shh!

53:05.160 --> 53:10.460
<i>...the pipes are calling</i>

53:10.560 --> 53:13.119
<i>From glen to glen</i>

53:14.280 --> 53:20.020
<i>And down the mountainside</i>

53:20.120 --> 53:30.500
<i>The summer's gone
and all the flowers are dying</i>

53:30.600 --> 53:32.879
<i>'Tis you, 'tis you</i>

53:34.840 --> 53:39.599
<i>Must go and I must bide</i>

53:41.880 --> 53:44.759
<i>But come ye back</i>

53:45.600 --> 53:50.599
<i>When summer's in the meadow</i>

53:51.520 --> 53:56.660
<i>Or when the valley's hushed</i>

53:56.760 --> 53:59.239
<i>And white with snow</i>

54:01.600 --> 54:06.100
<i>'Tis I'll be here</i>

54:06.200 --> 54:10.759
<i>In sunshine or in shadow</i>

54:12.280 --> 54:17.039
<i>Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy</i>

54:17.920 --> 54:21.559
<i>I love you so.</i>

54:28.080 --> 54:29.599
Well done!

54:32.240 --> 54:34.180
Didn't he do us proud?

54:34.280 --> 54:37.279
- I'll take it.
- That were great, Loll.

54:38.160 --> 54:40.300
Yeah, good'un Loll.

54:40.400 --> 54:42.860
- Did alright, I s'pose.
- Ta. Where's Jo?

54:42.960 --> 54:44.700
Probably with the other babies.

54:44.800 --> 54:47.020
Right then, we going up there or not?

54:47.120 --> 54:49.820
- I'm up for it.
- Loll? How about it?

54:49.920 --> 54:52.380
- Where you off to, then?
- Going by Bull's Cross.

54:52.480 --> 54:54.980
Harry Lazenby seen a phantom coach
two nights ago.

54:55.080 --> 54:57.300
There ain't no phantom coach.

54:57.400 --> 54:59.620
Alright, if you're scared.

54:59.720 --> 55:02.879
I ain't and I got no wine gums neither,
if that's what you're after.

55:03.400 --> 55:04.399
Your loss.

55:05.240 --> 55:06.980
I said I'd wait for Jo.

55:07.080 --> 55:09.540
Wasting your time with goody two-shoes.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.780
- Got a shift on.
- Ah, leave him behind.

55:11.880 --> 55:14.260
- If he ain't coming.
- Well, I've had it with this.

55:14.360 --> 55:16.679
Go home to your ma if you're too scared.

55:21.320 --> 55:23.279
Oh, alright then, wait up.

55:23.840 --> 55:26.719
I ain't waiting, slow and lazy Lee.

55:33.480 --> 55:38.180
Bull's Cross was an ancient staging post

55:38.280 --> 55:41.180
that cast up beasts and spirits.

55:41.280 --> 55:42.399
Anyone else hear that?

55:43.000 --> 55:44.500
That weren't nothing.

55:44.600 --> 55:45.660
Just an owl.

55:45.760 --> 55:48.580
We were afraid to go up there at night.

55:48.680 --> 55:51.460
Which is probably
why we did it so often.

55:51.560 --> 55:53.820
You hear what they say
about the phantom coach?

55:53.920 --> 55:59.599
Anyone who sets eyes upon it
be cursed to die an horrible death.

56:01.920 --> 56:03.700
Martin Fowler saw it.

56:03.800 --> 56:06.340
Two weeks later: dead.

56:06.440 --> 56:08.060
Run over by a coach and horses.

56:08.160 --> 56:11.780
That ain't no curse,
Martin Fowler was deaf and near blind.

56:11.880 --> 56:14.460
I heard the phantom's
an old coach driver.

56:14.560 --> 56:17.639
One time, his horses got spooked.

56:18.560 --> 56:21.940
They bolted,
throwing the driver from his seat.

56:22.040 --> 56:25.220
His head was dashed on the rocks.

56:25.320 --> 56:27.399
That's not what I heard.

56:27.960 --> 56:29.460
There was once a hangman.

56:29.560 --> 56:32.060
Used to string up villains
from that gibbet.

56:32.160 --> 56:34.380
He worked nights

56:34.480 --> 56:37.180
taking thieves and murderers
up to them gallows

56:37.280 --> 56:39.319
where they'd be hung

56:39.880 --> 56:42.839
'til they'd be dead, dead, dead.

56:43.520 --> 56:44.999
On a storm black night

56:45.600 --> 56:47.380
he's handed a shivering boy.

56:47.480 --> 56:50.199
So he takes this boy up the gallows

56:51.120 --> 56:54.359
puts a noose around his neck,
pulls the knot tight.

56:55.560 --> 56:58.719
A cloud moved from the moon
and lit up the gallows.

56:59.560 --> 57:01.319
The hangman looked up

57:02.160 --> 57:04.900
to see the face of his own son

57:05.000 --> 57:07.199
looking back at him.

57:08.440 --> 57:10.199
The hangman went home

57:11.080 --> 57:13.999
drove a nail into the wall
and did what he did best.

57:15.440 --> 57:17.239
Now he haunts this place.

57:22.400 --> 57:23.900
We should get out of here.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.399
Think I can hear horses.

57:28.200 --> 57:29.199
Loll...

57:30.160 --> 57:31.839
you see that?

57:33.640 --> 57:35.260
It's the phantom!

57:35.360 --> 57:36.559
- Quick, go!
- Go!

57:38.280 --> 57:39.759
Shh, shh!

58:03.000 --> 58:04.479
Get on, now.

58:12.120 --> 58:14.239
There's your phantom.

58:19.480 --> 58:21.519
Come on, let's follow him.

59:02.200 --> 59:05.359
Look at him,
he's cock of the walk, ain't he?

59:05.760 --> 59:07.159
Shh!

59:15.840 --> 59:17.199
We should go.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.620
- Come on, lazy bones!
- Give us a minute.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.759
What are you playing at?
You'll be late for school.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:27.479
What?

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:36.919
Morning.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.839
Something attack you in the night?

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.340
Just shaving.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.300
What for? You've got nothing but fluff.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.500
- Them's whiskers.
- Get on!

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.620
Be hairs on his chest next!

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.060
And everywhere else!

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.319
Leave him be!

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:54.999
Ma?

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.220
If I could unsee what I just saw...

01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.679
What'd you see?

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.780
It's terrible.

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.140
What is?

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.460
Come on,
we're not bleedin' mind readers!

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.159
Don't talk like that.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.799
Right, are you telling us or not?

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.380
I was...

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:16.140
I was just passing the Woolpack

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.919
and he... he's just lying there.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.559
He's just lying there and his...
his eyes are open.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.319
I think he's dead.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.740
We all knew what had happened.

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.900
We could taste the violence

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.399
even if we'd not seen it
with our own eyes.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.999
It was bloody and raw.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.300
And more terrifying
than anything imagined.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.700
Has anyone seen anything?

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.359
But the men that murdered him
belonged to the village

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.060
and the village looked after their own.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.439
What about you, boy?

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.599
You know anything?

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.399
Alright lads, let's get him up.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.900
The culprits were never punished.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.959
But neither we, nor they...

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.559
...ever forgot it.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.239
Have you seen him? The deserter?

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.159
The farmer's seen him in the woods.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.239
You sure you haven't seen him?

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.380
Get yourself home, lad.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.679
Come on.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.039
Why are you sad?

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.519
Cos I miss Frances.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.719
What's a deserter?

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.540
Where'd you hear that word?

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:27.559
From a soldier with a red hat on.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.700
Oh, Marge it's too late,
there's nothing you can do now, darling.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.020
I've got to warn him!

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.037
This'll only break your heart,
it's too late!

01:03:35.137 --> 01:03:37.740
- Don't you understand?
- Of course I understand.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.239
Well, then you know I have to go to him.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.300
Oh, darling...

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.020
Can I go with her to the war?

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.559
No, Loll.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.279
Oh, sweetheart...

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.719
Is the war coming to our house?

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.919
No sweetheart, we're safe here.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.719
Thank you, Loll.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.199
He's safe.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.119
For now.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.839
Come on Loll, hurry up!

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.719
- Jack, wait up!
- So slow.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.919
Jack!

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:08.900
That summer mysterious senses
clicked into play.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.060
Our thighs seemed
to burn like dry grass.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:16.140
Emotions swung wildly

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.380
and our bodies seemed tilted
out of all recognition.

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:23.119
We knew what was happening to us

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.799
we just didn't know what to do with it.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.159
- She ain't coming.
- She's always through after church.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:33.460
- Won't she... mind?
- Mind?

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:35.980
Lizzie's keen. Let us do all we want.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.300
All we want?

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.620
- Shut up, Loll.
- You shut up.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.839
Both of you, shut up.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.559
She's coming.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.559
Go on.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.639
Alright there, Lizzie.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.039
Hello.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.220
What are you doing?

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.439
- Whatever you want us to be doing.
- Yeah.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.919
Go on then, what do you got in mind?

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.999
Ow!

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.940
What do we do now, then?

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.599
I dunno, let's go.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.439
You alright, ma?

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.879
What happened?

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.519
It's Granny Trill.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:48.877
So many of my childhood days

01:07:48.977 --> 01:07:53.708
had been spent prowling slowly
round Granny Trill's treasures.

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.799
Now she was gone.

01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:17.799
Lord have mercy.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:54.519
Not two weeks after Granny Trill died,
Granny Wallen gave up in her sleep.

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.660
You coming in, then?

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:10.140
It was as though
I'd been dipped in hot oil.

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.300
Stone me...

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:17.660
Baked, dried and
hung throbbing on wires.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.879
I know you're there, Laurie Lee.

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.719
I was an unexploded bomb.

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.919
Where's ma?

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.199
Away with dad.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.780
You could smile, Loll,
the war's finished.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.020
Everyone's in the Woolpack, Marge,
there's music.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:55.380
Everyone's dancing! Let's go, Jack.

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:58.919
Stop a minute longer,
only a minute won't do no harm.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.700
Will pa die now the war is over?

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.060
No, course he won't.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.959
So he'll be coming home?

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.959
You got all the people you need already.

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.679
Ma, Doth, Phyl and me,
we look after you.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.620
I told you, leave me be!

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.980
A soldier, maybe he's seen pa!

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.020
Out of the way...

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.599
Oh, no!

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.700
I never told, I never told anyone!

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:41.820
James?

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.799
Stop it, you're hurting him!
Stop it, leave him alone!

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:52.100
Marge!

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.439
I love you!

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.079
I love you too.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:08.540
- Step away, please.
- No!

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:12.679
I knew something
momentous was happening.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.039
The war was over

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.639
and the end of the world was come.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.919
Mother had disappeared

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:27.119
and I never expected to see another day.

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:54.239
You weren't there
when the war ended, were you?

01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:58.439
You were in London with pa.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:05.039
You should've seen it.

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.799
Trafalgar Square...

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.639
The fountains...

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:17.159
There was soldiers dancing with girls.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.399
And there was Reg...

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.679
His uniform... his uniform on.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.079
His hair was just so.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.359
That night...

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.359
It were magic.

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.079
Magic it was.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.479
Was that the night he told you?

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.399
That he wasn't coming back
to live with us no more.

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:55.519
No, no, he never said that, see.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.959
Got a job in the civil service.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.639
We've never wanted for nothing, have we?

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.279
But we were his family.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:46.879
Alright, Loll?

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.079
Go on, get out of here.

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.799
You must be thirsty.

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.260
- I ain't.
- You be.

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.799
Come on, I'll show you.

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.780
Come on!

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.679
Unless you're scared.

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:17.300
The day Rosie Burdock
decided to take me in hand

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:20.039
was a motionless day of summer.

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:24.980
Creamy, hazy and amber-coloured

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.100
with beech trees
standing in heavy sunlight

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.119
as though clogged with wild, wet honey.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.620
What you doing, Rosie?
I ain't playing no more games.

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.380
Get under here before someone sees.

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.900
I was terrified of her.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.740
In her eyes, I saw unnatural wisdoms

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:51.060
more threatening
than anything I could imagine.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.439
- What you got there?
- Cider.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.999
How does it taste?

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:03.159
Like... like fire.

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.860
- Here, don't drink it all!
- I ain't finished!

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.319
Give it here!

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.759
Rosie...

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:33.559
I like you better than Walt Ken
and Boney Harris.

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.279
I, I think you're even prettier
than Betty Carpenter.

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.439
Should hope so.

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:52.020
We kissed...

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:58.119
So dry and shy,
it was like two leaves colliding in air.

01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.679
Loll?

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:09.759
Loll?

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:47.479
- You really like me more than Walt?
- Do I 'eck!

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.599
You do like me more than Walt.

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:02.999
- Look at this place...
- What about it?

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.180
The hills running together...

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:10.980
The trees... the whole valley.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.820
You ever feel like you're a part of it?

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.780
That cider's gone to your head!

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.999
It's magnificent.

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:59.159
- You got your boots on!
- Don't matter!

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.039
Timber!

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:17.599
You get home safe, Laurie Lee!

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:26.319
Rosie?

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.820
Oh, Rosie...

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:31.380
There's something about that evening

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:34.799
that dilates the memory, even now.

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:48.639
I was bursting with power and pleasure.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:58.380
I felt valiant, fateful
and for the first time in my life...

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:02.199
...invulnerable to the perils of night.

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:07.079
I was never the same again.

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.439
I think they're pretty.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.460
- What are you meant to be?
- Night.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:20.220
The year after the war ended,
we were celebrating peace.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.959
Rosie!

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:25.060
Don't you look a picture?

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:28.879
Oh, my goodness... you both do.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.839
All of you!

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:37.039
- I'm a fairy.
- You can fly?

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.639
You got wings?

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.879
Then fly.

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.599
Fly!

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:51.460
Rosie!

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.559
Oh, Loll, what'd you do that for?

01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:01.660
On that spring day
of magical transformations

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:07.460
of tears and dusty sunlight, of brass
bands and cakes by the cartload

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:12.519
we couldn't know
what the future held for any of us.

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:17.519
Pretty Jo grew fat
with a Painswood baker.

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:23.860
And Rosie, having baptised me
with her ciderous kisses

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:28.239
married a soldier
and I lost her forever.

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.940
If you all move over
to your right a little.

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:31.980
Keep very still.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:35.180
Suns rose and fell.

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:38.679
Years passed almost without us knowing.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:46.620
Now the last days
of my family drew near.

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:49.820
The girls were grown
and they wished to be gone.

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:53.060
You're not leaving.
Doth, Phyl, she's not leaving.

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.707
- Stay out of this.
- Put your case down.

01:22:54.807 --> 01:22:56.999
No! We're getting married!

01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:58.860
You're not taking her!

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.580
It's time, ma!

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:02.359
You can't keep her here
forever, Mrs Lee.

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.180
Who do you think you're talking to?

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.719
Huh?

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.740
- Mother!
- Ma!

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:17.959
- Stop it! Stop it!
- You're not taking her!

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.839
I cannot be without him!

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.559
We're in love.

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:30.919
Do you think I don't
understand about love?

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:35.700
He had tried to carry off
our willing sister

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:38.900
and we had all of us
very near killed him.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.580
Oh, come here!

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:42.540
Oh, me darling.

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:44.500
- It's alright, Mrs Lee.
- It's okay, you're right.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.380
There we go. You sit down, alright.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.340
Come here, my darling.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.479
Oh, Marge, oh, Marge...

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.879
That's me, then.

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:04.039
Do you remember
"Blackbirds and Thrushes"?

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.359
- Yeah.
- It was your dad's favourite.

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:11.359
Used to get me to sing it all the time.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:19.479
<i>As I was a-walkin' for my recreation</i>

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:22.500
<i>Down by the green...</i>

01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:27.300
The three or four years
my mother spent with my father

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:29.980
she fed on for the rest of her life.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:33.020
<i>...There I met a fair maid...</i>

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:38.220
She raised his two families
faithfully and alone.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:43.260
And for 30 years
she clung to one fantasy

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:46.559
that he might one day return to her.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.420
But he never did.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:54.740
<i>...With his heart full of yearning</i>

01:25:54.840 --> 01:26:01.580
<i>He found his dear Mary
all dead in her grave</i>

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:10.199
<i>He cried "I'm forsaken,
my poor heart is breaking"</i>

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:25.879
<i>I wish that I never...</i>

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:29.319
<i>...Left this fair maid.</i>

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.759
You're my soldier.

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:45.199
Off you go, then. Sit up straight.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:50.799
Off you go. Go on.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:03.620
My mother loved this world

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:07.959
and saw it fresh with hopes
that never clouded.

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:14.540
She was an artist,
a light-giver and an original.

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:18.479
And she never for a moment knew it.

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:28.540
As for me...

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:32.180
I was 19 years old.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.420
Still soft at the edges

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:38.239
but with the confident
belief in good fortune.

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.500
I was vainglorious

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:45.660
full of raging excitement

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:48.759
knowing I had far to go.

01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:57.879
I left behind a village life that was
soon to break, dissolve and scatter.

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:01.919
The valley would change forever

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.999
and so would I.

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.540
I felt doomed

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:13.199
and of all things, wonderful.
