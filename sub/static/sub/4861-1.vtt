(CHUCKLES)

20:14.380 --> 20:16.758
My family sent me away
when I was seven.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.977
That house was really
all I had left of them.

20:21.011 --> 20:24.481
But actually living there,
it's been too hard.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.481
I'm fixing it up
and I'm going to sell it.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.001
I heard you singing this morning.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.583
You can hear me
all the way from your house?

20:46.746 --> 20:49.499
(LAUGHS) It was nice.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.510
You in, like, a band or something?

20:53.669 --> 20:55.922
I was, back in Chicago.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.216
My dad was in a rock band.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.354
You got anything good?

21:05.681 --> 21:07.854
Still using cassettes.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.360
(LAUGHS)

21:09.518 --> 21:12.692
Dude, we got to get you
some new music.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.402
Yeah.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.952
I used to have one of these.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.958
Yeah, that was my dad's.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.914
So was this car.

21:29.371 --> 21:32.625
So are you and your mom
in Woodshire to stay?

21:32.792 --> 21:34.214
I hope so.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.367
It's so quiet here.

21:59.068 --> 22:01.070
Not like where I used to live.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.700
It's even quieter at dawn.

22:05.866 --> 22:09.211
Dawn? What are you doing up that early?

22:12.456 --> 22:15.551
I Sit Out back and I Write Stuff.

22:16.418 --> 22:19.513
Like stories. it's easy.

22:21.173 --> 22:24.768
I don't know, it's like...
it's like at that time of the day,

22:24.927 --> 22:27.646
because everyone is still asleep,

22:27.805 --> 22:30.228
all the best thoughts
haven't been taken yet.

22:35.646 --> 22:38.570
(PHONE RING-S)

22:41.277 --> 22:45.123
It's my mom. I better go.

22:45.948 --> 22:48.201
Thank you, for driving me.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.337
Yeah, you're welcome.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.972
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:09.138 --> 23:12.187
Did Tyler's mom give you a ride home?

23:12.349 --> 23:14.727
No. Actually, Ryan Jacobson did.

23:14.894 --> 23:19.695
Ryan Jacobson?
How did Ryan Jacobson give you a ride?

23:20.232 --> 23:22.030
No one wanted to give me a ride,

23:22.192 --> 23:26.117
so I started to walk,
he saw me and gave me a ride.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.374
Why didn't you call me?
I would have come to get you.

25:06.130 --> 25:09.600
- (SCREAMING)
- Carrie Anne, stop it!

25:09.758 --> 25:12.227
Stop! Please, Carrie Anne, stop it!

25:12.386 --> 25:14.309
- OW!
- (SCREAMING)

25:14.471 --> 25:16.644
Stop it, Carrie Anne! Stop, please!

25:17.391 --> 25:20.144
(GROWLING)
-Ah! God!

25:22.896 --> 25:25.399
Sh... sh...

25:27.693 --> 25:30.993
Sh... Itâs OK.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.290
It's OK. It's OK.

25:35.743 --> 25:38.121
Why do you do this all the time,
Carrie Anne?

25:39.913 --> 25:41.790
Don't I look after you?

25:46.795 --> 25:49.298
Listen, we have a new neighbor, OK?

25:50.340 --> 25:52.638
Her name is Elissa.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.599
Her and her mom just moved
into the Reeds' house.

25:54.762 --> 25:57.811
And I want you to leave her alone,
you understand me?

25:59.183 --> 26:00.901
Yeah.

27:11.213 --> 27:12.886
Bitch.

27:16.009 --> 27:17.556
GIRL: Hey.

27:17.719 --> 27:18.686
Elissa, right?

27:18.846 --> 27:20.894
-Yeah.
- Hi. I'm Jillian.

27:21.056 --> 27:24.435
. Hey-
- Um.--

27:24.601 --> 27:27.946
- Thanks for tucking me in yesterday.
- Anytime.

27:28.105 --> 27:30.403
I'm not much of a drinker
and I got sick

27:30.566 --> 27:32.944
all over Caitlin's bath towels
and she threw a fit.

27:33.110 --> 27:35.704
Who are these people,
why are you friends with them?

27:36.613 --> 27:39.082
I don't know. I mean...

27:39.241 --> 27:42.245
I used to go out with Tyler,
but he's kind of a dick.

27:42.411 --> 27:44.129
He's worse than a dick.
He's a dick-hole.

27:44.288 --> 27:46.006
Dick-hole is the new asshole.

27:47.040 --> 27:51.591
- Hm.
- Oh, hey. Jake.

27:51.753 --> 27:54.848
Elissa, this is my brother Jake
and his best friend, Robbie.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.384
You guys, this is Elissa.

27:56.550 --> 27:59.770
Yeah, I've been wanting to meet you.
You were in a band.

27:59.928 --> 28:02.022
- How did you know...
- Oh. Google.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.604
Nothing is sacred anymore, right?
Everything's online.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.485
Anyway, we have
the Battle of the Bands coming up.

28:10.314 --> 28:11.691
So, what do you say?

28:11.857 --> 28:14.110
- You want to come sing with us?
- And if you suck?

28:14.276 --> 28:15.277
(LAUGHS)

28:15.444 --> 28:18.448
We don't. Here, that's us.

28:18.614 --> 28:21.663
Listen to it, if you like it,
come check us out, practice tomorrow.

28:21.825 --> 28:22.872
OK, cool.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.955
- Cool. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

28:26.121 --> 28:27.714
Bye.

28:28.165 --> 28:31.544
- He likes you.
-I already got a job.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.804
Excuse me, Officer!

28:34.963 --> 28:36.806
Hey, did I forget to sign something?

28:36.965 --> 28:39.639
Oh, no, no.
I just wanted to ask you something.

28:39.801 --> 28:43.055
- I'm Sarah, Sarah Cassidy.
- Bill Weaver, what's up?

28:43.222 --> 28:45.941
I just moved here with my daughter,
who's 17,

28:46.099 --> 28:48.147
and we have a rental on Sycamore Lane.

28:48.310 --> 28:50.233
And you wanted to know
if I thought it was possible

28:50.395 --> 28:53.945
you had a 17-year-old daughter.
I would have to say no.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.826
It's actually about Ryan Jacobson.

28:56.985 --> 28:59.238
He drove my daughter home
the other night.

28:59.404 --> 29:03.125
I was just wondering if you
knew anything about him. If he's...

29:03.283 --> 29:04.079
OK?

29:04.952 --> 29:06.124
Yeah.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.748
Finding out that your parents
were murdered,

29:08.914 --> 29:12.794
by your own sister, God,
that's really intense.

29:12.960 --> 29:16.134
You'd think people would show him
a little bit of sympathy, right?

29:17.089 --> 29:20.844
You know, I drove three hours upstate
personally to tell Ryan.

29:21.009 --> 29:23.478
He was living with his aunt,
a senile old woman.

29:23.637 --> 29:27.562
He had no one taking care of him.
He was taking care of her, actually.

29:27.724 --> 29:31.069
Anyway, he moved back here with her,
she died about a year ago.

29:31.228 --> 29:34.823
The Kid's had a tough, tough life.

29:34.982 --> 29:37.701
Look, I've never had
any problem with him,

29:37.859 --> 29:39.657
and as far as I know,
no one else has either.

29:39.820 --> 29:43.199
But they sure like to bitch about him
and their property values, don't they?

29:43.365 --> 29:46.118
Yeah, I have heard people doing that.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.583
- 710-49 at Main and Jackson. Over.
- Excuse me.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.292
OK.

29:50.455 --> 29:53.004
Sorry. I gotta go.

29:55.377 --> 29:56.469
Thanks, officer.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.848
Oh, hey, no.
it's, uh, Bill, OK?

30:00.340 --> 30:01.216
Bill.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.932
- I'll see you around?
- Yeah.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.303
- Hi.
- Hey.

30:39.463 --> 30:42.216
I... made you a CD.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.845
Wow, thank you.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.899
Oh, my gosh, my page.

30:53.185 --> 30:56.109
Yeah... I wanted to listen
to some more of your music.

30:58.648 --> 31:00.241
That's not weird, is it?

31:00.400 --> 31:03.404
No. Not unless you didn't like it.

31:03.570 --> 31:08.076
No, actually,
I thought it was beautiful.

31:09.242 --> 31:12.246
Good answer. Whoa!

31:12.829 --> 31:15.457
Stocking up
the old fallout shelter, huh?

31:16.833 --> 31:20.804
Um, yeah. I don't like to go to town
more than I have to.

31:39.147 --> 31:42.822
Wow, it's big.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.577
What's up there?

31:48.740 --> 31:51.459
Construction never really got finished
on this part of the house.

31:51.618 --> 31:57.625
I don't have a wall or anything,
but I moved back here when I came back.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.673
It's a little bit small.

32:00.836 --> 32:03.589
Well, at least you're not a sleepwalker.

32:05.132 --> 32:08.352
- ls this the family?
- Yeah.

32:10.637 --> 32:12.890
Oh, Ryan, you're so cute.

32:14.307 --> 32:16.901
And that's Carrie Anne.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.904
Wow. Her eyes are so blue.

32:22.149 --> 32:24.743
Your family looks really happy.

32:26.319 --> 32:30.290
It must've been nice,
having everyone together.

32:31.658 --> 32:33.331
Having two parents.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.457
Carrie Anne was the head of the family.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.294
After the accident, things changed.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.469
Is that when they sent you away?

32:50.677 --> 32:53.931
I've never really talked to anyone
about this stuff before.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.152
ELISSA: What's in here?

33:06.693 --> 33:08.866
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have...

33:09.029 --> 33:10.952
It's OK, you don't have to go.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.493
I haven't been in here in a long time.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.959
ELISSA: I thought she was 13.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.928
This looks like a little kid's room.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.392
She had brain damage.

33:39.809 --> 33:41.811

33:41.978 --> 33:44.481

33:45.273 --> 33:47.367
Her favorite thing
was to play on the swings.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.538
My mom and dad were inside.

33:53.573 --> 33:55.575
I was supposed to be watching her.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.458
But she kept wanting to get higher.

34:24.271 --> 34:26.273
RYAN: When she woke up,
she was different.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.866
She used to scream all the time,

34:32.027 --> 34:35.998
and she would attack us
and break things.

34:36.449 --> 34:39.202
Is that why there are bars
on all the windows?

34:39.369 --> 34:40.416
Yeah.

34:40.579 --> 34:44.379
She never knew where she was.
She would...

34:44.541 --> 34:50.047
She'd run out into the woods.
They were to keep her in.

34:54.509 --> 34:57.262
Now they just keep the townies
from coming down here.

34:59.306 --> 35:01.354
I don't really like coming
into this part of the house.

35:17.574 --> 35:22.501
Well, thank you.
And I hope you like the CD.

35:22.662 --> 35:24.255
Yeah. Thank you.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.788
- I have to go to work.
- Hey.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.244
Thanks.

36:41.074 --> 36:43.042
- How was school?
- Mm...

36:43.201 --> 36:45.078
School's school. How's work?

36:45.245 --> 36:48.590
It's OK. I don't know.
The late shifts are kind of tough.

36:48.748 --> 36:52.423
But I like being in the hospital.
I like the drama.

36:52.585 --> 36:54.679
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)
- What did you do after school?

36:55.880 --> 37:00.602
I, um...
dropped off a CD at Ryan's house.

37:01.302 --> 37:04.181
And he's really sweet...

37:04.347 --> 37:05.644
...and sad...

37:05.807 --> 37:07.809
...and lonely, all at the same time.

37:07.976 --> 37:10.320
He's all by himself in this big house,
with the shades drawn.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.572
You went to his house?

37:12.731 --> 37:15.109
We dropped 'shrooms
and had unprotected sex.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.613
- I know what you're doing.
- What?

37:19.779 --> 37:21.622
- You're trying to save him.
- I am not.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.533
Yes, you are. That's what you do,
you like to fix people.

you finally decided to be a parent!

I invited him over last night,

46:24.323 --> 46:25.996
and then I threw him out

46:26.158 --> 46:28.661
and I told him I didn't want him
to be alone with Elissa.

46:28.828 --> 46:32.002
So Elissa's not talking to me,

46:32.164 --> 46:34.838
and I'm sure Ryan
thinks I'm against him,

46:35.001 --> 46:37.629

in this ridiculous town.

46:37.795 --> 46:39.843
Ryan's a smart kid, I'm sure he gets it.

I mean, I'm not stupid.
I can't keep her away from boys.

46:44.385 --> 46:47.309

the same mistake I always make,

46:47.471 --> 46:49.599

46:49.765 --> 46:52.518

like I'm a child.

46:52.685 --> 46:54.938

46:55.104 --> 47:00.326
She was just getting wasted and trashy
and he was so nice and gentle.

She didn't even care, she still talked
to him like he was a monster.

47:04.071 --> 47:06.244
That's what she does.
She picks the most damaged kid around,

47:06.407 --> 47:08.751
