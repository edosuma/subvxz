WEBVTT

01:10.504 --> 01:12.541
Who the hell is Dr. Hvit?

01:45.872 --> 01:47.647
Dr. Farragut, you wanted to see me?

01:48.108 --> 01:49.746
Yeah, I wanna
show you something.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.651
Is it Peter?

01:52.045 --> 01:55.959
No. His status is unchanged.
Still no brain activity.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.325
Have a look at this.

01:58.485 --> 02:02.262
I used your protocols and a modified
compound I've been experimenting with.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.930
I substituted multiple residues
at these two binding sites,

02:06.093 --> 02:08.095
added a tetrahydrofuran
carbamate here,

02:08.628 --> 02:09.767
<i>a via-Line ring here,</i>

02:09.930 --> 02:11.432
all to reduce stearic interaction.

02:12.099 --> 02:15.637
And that's taking the virus
longer to break the SODRAs down.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.645
But it still does in the end.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.284
I've taken this <i>as</i> far as I can
in culture.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.976
I need to see how it reacts
in living tissue.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.988
I can start animal studies to test efficacy
and safety, have results in 24 hours.

02:26.146 --> 02:30.117
I'd like to bring my veterinary pathologist,
Doreen Boyle, up to speed on this.

02:30.283 --> 02:34.595
I think she could be a big help.
Alan, this is progress.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.361
It has to work in the rats first.
And if it does?

02:37.524 --> 02:40.596
If it does, Hatake
won't have any more excuses.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.331
We'll reopen Level R,

02:42.496 --> 02:44.874
start testing Julia and the rest
of the infected patients.

02:46.199 --> 02:49.305
Dr. Farragut. I asked you
to check in on the hour.

02:49.469 --> 02:51.847
Uninterrupted research
is how we get results.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.884
If Hatake has a problem with that,
he can talk to me himself.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.648
Whatever that's worth.
He left me in charge while he...

02:57.811 --> 03:00.121
While he conducts base business.
Right.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.466
Shh. Shh, someone might
hear you.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.128
It hurts.
I know, but you have to stay quiet.

03:14.294 --> 03:16.740
If they find you,
they'll take you back to Level R.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.706
I have to get back to my lab work.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.903
I'll try and get back as soon
as I can with more morphine.

03:24.671 --> 03:27.311
Warm, gooey chocolate brownies.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.982
A study at the University
of Wisconsin showed

03:30.143 --> 03:33.249
that fantasizing about delicious food
can help minimize pain.

03:33.413 --> 03:35.689
Brownies are my go-to.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.554
Cupcakes.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.322
That's good.

03:40.353 --> 03:42.390
What kind?
The more specific, the better.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.269
Red velvet, cream cheese icing.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.699
And none of that flaky cake.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.342
I like it dense.

03:54.601 --> 03:55.671
Did it help?

03:56.403 --> 03:58.076
A little.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.445
But now I'm hungry.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.629
The worst part is the waiting.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.956
Death should come
out of nowhere.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.466
You shouldn't have to
stare it in the face.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.065
How do you do it,

04:21.228 --> 04:23.902
knowing you're just waiting to die?

04:25.298 --> 04:27.574
We're all waiting to die.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.308
I just have a little less time.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.259
What the hell are you doing?

04:53.393 --> 04:54.895
It's comfy.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.801
Get out of his chair.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.904
Sure. Where's Dr. Hvit?

05:00.333 --> 05:02.313
Who?
Dr. Hvit.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.109
I need to speak to him
or her right away.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.445
No one on this base
by the name of Dr. Hvit.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.151
Now get out of his chair.

05:15.081 --> 05:17.118
He's got you well-trained.

05:17.284 --> 05:18.354
Excuse me?

05:18.518 --> 05:20.930
How much is he paying you
to inspire such loyalty?

05:21.087 --> 05:23.328
I don't work for him.
That's right.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.027
He adopted you.
You're like a son to him.

05:26.259 --> 05:29.172
I am his son.
You know, in the favelas in Rio,

05:29.329 --> 05:31.866
the gangs,
they call themselves a familia.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.171
Family. And they have a saying:

05:34.768 --> 05:36.805
Blood in, blood out.

05:37.204 --> 05:40.048
They'd find these little boys,
9, 10 years old,

05:40.207 --> 05:43.711
and they'd make them murder people,
to bond them to the gang.

05:43.877 --> 05:44.981
Blood in.

05:45.145 --> 05:49.321
These boys, they'd go so deep, they'd
have no idea that they were grunts,

05:49.482 --> 05:51.155
that they were expendable.

05:51.718 --> 05:56.064
And if they disobeyed,
or tried to leave the gang?

05:59.359 --> 06:00.963
Blood out.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.901
Hatake's down in Level R,
doing God knows what.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.875
You think he left you in charge
because he trusts you,

06:08.034 --> 06:10.480
or because he's trying
to distract you?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.742
You need to get out of this office.

06:14.841 --> 06:16.514
Now.

06:57.851 --> 06:58.886
Please. We have food.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.566
There's plenty here.
We can all share.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.899
Are you sick? Get
the hell away from here.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.562
It's a waste of time.
We should get out of the hallway.

07:08.728 --> 07:12.403
We have to organize the people down here.
It's a better chance of survival.

07:12.565 --> 07:15.273
Can we talk about the real
reason you don't wanna go back?

07:15.435 --> 07:18.439
What's that?
The initials on the wall. Your initials.

07:18.605 --> 07:22.212
Weren't my initials. I've never been here.
How to explain your handwriting?

07:22.375 --> 07:24.981
Hallucinations are one of
the symptoms of the infection.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.920
Nice try, but I saw them too.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.754
Is it possible you were here
when you were younger?

07:31.084 --> 07:34.588
Yeah, I must have forgotten all those
family vacations to the Arctic Circle.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.663
I grew up in Montana.

07:37.824 --> 07:41.169
The most exotic place I ever went
as a kid was Bozeman.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.103
Jules.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.303
What did you just call me?

07:46.833 --> 07:49.473
If you don't like it,
I won't call you that.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.908
No, it's just, uh,

07:52.072 --> 07:54.814
Alan and my mother are the
only ones who ever called me that.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.319
Help.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.257
Please.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.211
Doreen.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.621
Jesus.

08:32.779 --> 08:33.883
Hold on.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.237
Oh, my God.

08:47.394 --> 08:50.034
What happened?
Was she attacked by a vector?

08:50.196 --> 08:51.732
It was the rats.

08:51.898 --> 08:53.969
The rats?
How did they get out?

08:54.134 --> 08:57.581
Cages were turned over on her. Maybe
she had some kind of heart attack,

08:57.737 --> 09:00.183
grabbed the rack,
and it went down when she did.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.717
Or someone pushed it.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.582
You think someone did this
on purpose?

09:07.480 --> 09:09.983
We have annual physicals
for field duty.

09:10.150 --> 09:14.826
If Doreen had any hint of cardiac distress,
she'd never have been permitted to join.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.366
Altitude changes affect
individuals differently.

09:17.524 --> 09:20.403
And the CO2 scrubbers were
turned off for four hours yesterday.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.164
Seems like she was in good health.

09:22.328 --> 09:25.741
Do you know how many murders have
occurred at this base, Dr. Farragut?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.173
Zero.

09:27.333 --> 09:30.780
Accidents, however, happen all the time.
This wasn't a goddamn accident!

09:33.373 --> 09:35.546
- Until the evidence suggests other...
- Evidence?

09:35.708 --> 09:37.881
We're in the ass-end of nowhere,
cut off.

09:38.044 --> 09:41.719
My best doctor is trapped
and dying somewhere below us,

09:42.215 --> 09:45.628
and my closest friend from the CDC
has very likely just been murdered.

09:45.785 --> 09:48.265
This place is a...
It's a time bomb waiting to go off.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.866
And we're pretending this...

09:50.023 --> 09:52.367
These goddamn things
are gonna save us.

09:59.199 --> 10:02.703
Right now, I'm thinking
the virus is not our biggest problem.

10:06.739 --> 10:08.980
I'll review the surveillance
footage immediately.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.281
No. Not alone, you won't.

10:12.412 --> 10:13.720
Sarah, find Dr. Duchamp.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.326
Tell him to start the animal trials
with the SODRA immediately.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.555
You find me
if there are complications.

10:24.824 --> 10:27.270
I said we would bring
food and water

10:27.427 --> 10:30.670
if they turned the oxygen
scrubbers back on,

10:30.830 --> 10:32.332
but they attacked me.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.479
Bleeding is slowing,
but you need stitches.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.407
We need to get you
to that lab we set up for triage.

10:37.570 --> 10:40.574
That's on the other side.
We can't drag him all the way there.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.151
Why not?

10:42.308 --> 10:43.412
What was that?

10:43.810 --> 10:47.656
Dr. Hatake, this is Jaye. Jaye, Hatake.
Jaye?

10:48.114 --> 10:52.256
Don't pretend you don't know who I am.
And I won't pretend I'm gonna help you

10:52.418 --> 10:54.455
after you locked us here
by ourselves.

10:54.621 --> 10:58.296
You did seal us up down here.
I had no choice.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.530
We could not allow
the infection to spread.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.765
We need to get to that lab.
Close this wound.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.501
It's too dangerous.
We'd never make it.

11:06.666 --> 11:10.204
Is there any other way across this level?
An access tunnel.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.214
It goes all the way
to the other side of the base.

11:13.806 --> 11:19.813
But I would not ask you
to risk your life for mine.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.458
You don't have to ask.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.322
You need my help,
I'm gonna help you.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.335
Let's narrow the
window of incident.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.371
When was the last time
you saw Dr. Boyle?

11:36.529 --> 11:40.875
About 9 a.m. yesterday morning.
In 10 hours, you didn't check in?

11:41.234 --> 11:43.805
I was running SODRA
trials on my brother.

11:43.970 --> 11:46.644
And she was capable,
she didn't need to check in.

11:46.806 --> 11:50.413
Right. Uninterrupted research.

11:55.582 --> 11:56.720
What happened there?

11:58.818 --> 12:00.593
The file's been corrupted.

12:00.753 --> 12:03.233
I'll check the backup.
Uh-huh.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.504
That's impossible.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.268
The backups have been
deleted too.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.504
The only ones with access
are me and...

12:15.668 --> 12:17.170
Hatake.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.044
Who's conveniently disappeared.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.446
Neither of us
have anything to do with this.

12:23.610 --> 12:26.352
I will find out what happened
to Dr. Boyle.

12:26.512 --> 12:30.688
I'll find out myself,
through an autopsy.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.410
Dr. Duchamp?

12:55.441 --> 12:57.045
I'm Major Balleseros.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.746
Is this another check-in?

12:59.145 --> 13:02.251
I'm showing no signs of infection.
No.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.256
I'm looking for a Dr. Hvit.

13:08.054 --> 13:11.797
A name I haven't heard in a while.
I was going through the research files

13:11.958 --> 13:14.336
and I saw that you two
did a paper together.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.735
That was many years ago.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.740
So he's no longer on the base?
Oh, no, he is.

13:19.899 --> 13:22.140
It's just no one ever
sees him anymore.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.516
I hear he developed
a rare immune deficiency.

13:27.674 --> 13:30.280
He can no longer interact
with people.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.848
He's become somewhat
of an urban legend.

13:33.012 --> 13:35.014
I heard rumors
he's in the White Room.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.586
Where can I find that?

13:39.686 --> 13:42.166
We are all in the White Room.

13:48.294 --> 13:51.537
Excuse me.
I need to speak with the major.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.046
Did you kill the CDC vet?
You'd think I'd remember that.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.790
Did you do it?
What did the surveillance video show?

14:07.880 --> 14:09.188
Did Hatake know?

14:10.016 --> 14:13.054
Ask him.
He tells you everything, right?

14:13.219 --> 14:16.325
Dr. Farragut is running an autopsy
as we speak.

14:16.889 --> 14:19.165
You better hope
you covered your tracks.

14:23.496 --> 14:27.467
<i>Code 852, Level D, Hematology.</i>

14:27.633 --> 14:35.633
<i>Attention.
Code 852, Level D, Hematology.</i>

14:49.255 --> 14:51.326
Dr. Van Eigem?

14:52.925 --> 14:54.563
Shit.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.882
Dr. Van Eigem,
what are you doing?

15:13.346 --> 15:15.690
I'm dancing for Tony.

15:20.019 --> 15:21.054
Tony isn't here.

15:22.021 --> 15:24.126
Of course he is.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.608
What's wrong?

15:52.718 --> 15:53.753
What happened?

15:55.288 --> 15:57.097
I couldn't stop myself.

16:03.262 --> 16:05.572
I'm gonna turn into
one of those things, aren't I?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.775
We need to get you back to the room.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.141
Come on.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.250
How long is it?

16:17.410 --> 16:19.014
Forty meters.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.749
We go around. Who knows
what's waiting for us in there?

16:21.914 --> 16:24.019
Yeah, but we don't have time.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.034
All right, let's go.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.511
What are we stepping on?

16:42.034 --> 16:43.775
Looks like glass.

16:43.936 --> 16:47.110
Someone busted the lights out.
Probably trying to hide.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.713
Or setting a trap.

17:10.695 --> 17:11.731
Found anything?

17:12.330 --> 17:13.833
She died of an embolism.

17:15.166 --> 17:18.204
A scan revealed bruising
in the left hemisphere of her brain

17:18.371 --> 17:20.248
consistent with an air bubble.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.984
So it was natural causes.

17:23.142 --> 17:26.021
Why would anyone have erased
the security footage?

17:26.679 --> 17:28.681
Did you see Doreen yesterday?

17:28.848 --> 17:30.054
Just in passing.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.856
Did she say anything?
About her research?

17:33.019 --> 17:34.828
Any breakthrough she might've had?

17:34.987 --> 17:36.193
No, she didn't.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.372
I didn't know Doreen well,
but she seemed like a good person

17:43.529 --> 17:46.203
to have on your team.
I knew her 15 years.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.576
She didn't deserve this.

17:53.272 --> 17:55.252
Did she have any family?

17:55.408 --> 17:56.785
A son from her third marriage.

17:56.943 --> 17:59.355
Hand me that bottle of alcohol.

18:13.859 --> 18:14.929
What is that?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.233
Puncture mark.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.973
From a needle.

18:26.305 --> 18:28.376
I don't wanna become
one of those things.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.043
I know.

18:30.209 --> 18:31.415
Don't let me.

18:33.245 --> 18:35.816
You know what I'm asking.

18:39.318 --> 18:40.388
You're sick.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.589
It's the drugs talking.

18:44.256 --> 18:47.100
I was on my way
to the drug stockroom...

18:48.661 --> 18:53.132
before I saw Tony.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.407
I can't do it myself.

19:00.172 --> 19:01.810
Please.

19:02.608 --> 19:04.349
Please.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.817
Sarah?

19:33.973 --> 19:35.680
Sarah, it's Alan.

19:41.781 --> 19:42.901
You all right in there?

19:43.215 --> 19:44.285
One minute.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.970
Hey. Sorry, I was just getting changed.

19:54.326 --> 19:55.396
What's going on?

19:56.028 --> 19:58.736
Doreen was murdered.
The autopsy proves it.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.003
How?
Somebody used a syringe

20:01.167 --> 20:03.306
to make it look like
she had an embolism.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.005
They knew what they were doing.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.343
We need to be careful.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.374
Are you okay?

20:08.541 --> 20:10.418
Yeah. I'm...

20:10.576 --> 20:12.078
I, uh...

20:13.212 --> 20:16.193
I just don't know what's going on
here. I mean,

20:16.348 --> 20:19.022
Walker's sick, Doreen's dead,

20:19.185 --> 20:21.825
you're telling me
that somebody murdered her. I...

20:22.555 --> 20:25.195
Are we even gonna make it
out of this place alive?

20:25.357 --> 20:27.428
Shh-shh-shh. It's okay.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.930
It's okay.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.373
I won't let anything happen to you.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.378
All right?

20:43.709 --> 20:45.746
Sarah, I...
I'm sorry.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.118
I shouldn't have done that.

20:49.281 --> 20:50.521
Are you high?

20:51.550 --> 20:52.858
What?

20:53.018 --> 20:54.395
I can barely see your pupils.

20:54.553 --> 20:57.591
What are you on?
I had a migraine, so I took something.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.202
What?

20:59.525 --> 21:00.799
Gabapentin.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.372
You're lying,
unless you took the whole bottle.

21:03.529 --> 21:06.908
Alan, wait. I can explain...
No. There's no excuse for this, ever.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.706
People's lives are at stake.
They're depending on us.

21:09.869 --> 21:13.316
You're of no use to me like this.
No, you go sleep this off.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.543
We'll deal with it later.

21:33.993 --> 21:37.304
I'm sorry.
Can we take a moment?

21:37.463 --> 21:39.807
No, not really.

21:43.102 --> 21:45.412
Let me take a look at your wound.

21:48.774 --> 21:50.685
Oh...

21:51.243 --> 21:53.746
We need to tie something
around you for more pressure.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.856
Here, use this.

21:57.349 --> 21:59.260
And hurry up.

21:59.752 --> 22:02.426
I'm gonna need you
to lean forward for me.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.445
What was that?

22:22.274 --> 22:24.345
Oh, my God. Rats.

22:25.711 --> 22:28.658
Where are they coming from?

22:28.814 --> 22:31.226
what are they running from?

22:36.488 --> 22:38.024
Run!

22:40.960 --> 22:43.065
Get her off me!

22:49.335 --> 22:50.405
The door!

22:50.736 --> 22:52.238
Get to the door!

22:59.311 --> 23:01.416
Where's Jaye?
She was right behind me.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.890
I didn't see her.
We have to go back.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.659
It's too late.

23:19.531 --> 23:21.033
What exactly are we looking for?

23:22.201 --> 23:24.579
Anything salvageable
of Doreen's research.

23:24.737 --> 23:28.412
Any clue as to what she might
have discovered before she...

23:29.875 --> 23:32.082
You think there's
some kind of cover-up?

23:32.244 --> 23:33.951
Why else would anyone kill her?

23:38.083 --> 23:40.393
The transgenics lab.
What about it?

23:40.552 --> 23:42.862
Lab where they found the monkey
was cleaned out

23:43.022 --> 23:45.127
before she had a chance
to gather samples.

23:45.291 --> 23:47.567
She didn't tell you?
No, she didn't.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.070
Sanitized from top to bottom.
Hatake must have ordered it.

23:51.230 --> 23:54.404
If it was cleaned out, where'd she get
the monkey sample she was analyzing?

23:54.566 --> 23:57.376
Maybe some of the scientists
from here were helping her.

23:57.903 --> 24:01.282
Come to think of it,
she did mention a name.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.587
Dr. Hvit?

24:04.877 --> 24:06.550
She never mentioned him to me.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.323
That's strange.
She said she spoke to him.

24:09.481 --> 24:11.927
Said he seemed to have
all the answers.

24:14.420 --> 24:17.458
Well, I will find this Dr. Hvit,

24:17.623 --> 24:20.069
see if he can shed any light
on the situation.

24:29.001 --> 24:32.141
I don't know a Dr. Hvit.
Doreen talked to him.

24:32.838 --> 24:34.511
She talked to him?

24:34.673 --> 24:35.777
Doreen told you that?

24:35.941 --> 24:37.852
No. Major Balleseros did.

24:38.844 --> 24:41.347
Major Balleseros also told me

24:41.513 --> 24:43.857
how they found
the transgenics lab cleaned out.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.927
Guess you know nothing
about that either.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.962
A routine sanitization procedure.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.623
That was a cover-up.
Why would we wanna cover up

24:50.789 --> 24:52.928
a virus that we need you to cure?

24:54.326 --> 24:57.466
You're so focused
on seeing us as the bad guys,

24:57.629 --> 24:59.973
you don't see
what's right in front of you.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.301
How well do you know
Major Balleseros?

25:03.635 --> 25:06.775
I met him five days ago.
Same day you met me.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.316
And you trust him?

25:08.807 --> 25:10.286
Why?

25:10.442 --> 25:12.183
Because he's wearing a uniform?

25:15.347 --> 25:18.328
How did you get
those scars on your back?

25:21.186 --> 25:28.195
There was a fire, years
ago, at my home in Kyoto.

25:29.728 --> 25:34.370
The entire house was in flames
when I arrived.

25:34.733 --> 25:36.576
My daughter

25:37.469 --> 25:39.312
was still inside.

25:41.874 --> 25:44.081
I tried to save her.

25:48.514 --> 25:50.516
What was she like?

25:51.050 --> 25:52.893
Your daughter.

25:55.921 --> 25:58.026
She was smart.

25:59.425 --> 26:02.065
Curious about the world.
Ha, ha.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.669
You...

26:09.835 --> 26:12.247
You remind me of her.

26:24.783 --> 26:26.888
I haven't heard anything outside
for a while.

26:27.052 --> 26:29.692
We should try and
get to the triage lab.

26:43.735 --> 26:46.147
What made you change your mind?

26:59.885 --> 27:03.332
I know what it's like to be in pain.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.759
The kind of pain that

27:07.559 --> 27:09.630
you would do anything
to make it stop.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.604
And I've never considered
ending it, but...

27:16.802 --> 27:20.682
Don't we all wish that
we could control when we go

27:21.740 --> 27:23.777
and how we go?

27:26.245 --> 27:27.849
Are you sure?

27:30.682 --> 27:32.821
Are you really sure?

27:34.853 --> 27:36.594
Yes.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.201
Thank you.

29:01.873 --> 29:03.614
Got something.

29:04.176 --> 29:05.280
This is Semtex.

29:05.944 --> 29:07.048
Plastic explosive.

29:09.114 --> 29:11.390
Balleseros sabotaged the satellite.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.565
Because he didn't need it
to call out.

29:26.932 --> 29:30.744
He's been sending messages
to someone since we got here.

29:32.404 --> 29:35.146
Doreen's research is on here too.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.550
He killed her.

29:41.413 --> 29:46.954
"Found Dr. Hvit in the White Room.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.429
Evac 1500."

29:49.788 --> 29:52.325
What is the damn White Room?

29:57.129 --> 30:02.101
<i>Attention.
Code 517, Level E, Virology Lab.</i>

30:41.306 --> 30:42.944
Duchamp.

30:43.108 --> 30:44.382
Where is the White Room?

30:45.544 --> 30:47.524
We are all in the White Room.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.660
It's an inside joke
among the base scientists.

30:52.818 --> 30:54.559
We're in the Arctic.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.162
It's all the White Room.

30:57.322 --> 30:58.528
They're outside.

31:38.830 --> 31:40.832
I see you got my message.

31:46.371 --> 31:47.509
Thanks.

31:47.672 --> 31:49.777
I would never have found Hvit
without you.

32:02.687 --> 32:06.464
Dr. Hatake, stay with me now.
We're almost there.

32:06.958 --> 32:11.304
Please, you can call me Hiroshi.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.138
Come on.

32:39.257 --> 32:40.736
Took you guys long enough.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.668
Nobody goes
outside in a whiteout.

32:46.832 --> 32:49.073
You won't see more than 2 feel
in any direction.

32:49.234 --> 32:52.238
There are guide ropes to follow, right?
It's not that simple.

32:52.404 --> 32:54.509
You've never experienced
anything like this.

32:54.673 --> 32:57.017
Minus 60,
and the wind chill doubles that.

32:58.443 --> 33:02.084
Fine, if you're doing this,
you stay on the guidelines

33:02.247 --> 33:05.251
around the building
until you get to the line going out.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.590
Do not unclip until
you get there,

33:07.752 --> 33:11.666
or else you'll just disappear.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.773
I managed to get Tracey
off of me, and then I ran.

33:19.931 --> 33:23.936
It was too dark for her to see me, I guess.
I ducked into the first lab I could find,

33:24.102 --> 33:27.140
and then I came here.
I thought for sure you were dead.

33:27.472 --> 33:28.678
That makes two of us.

33:32.978 --> 33:35.117
Jaye, I...
Don't beat yourself up

33:35.280 --> 33:36.486
for closing that door.

33:36.648 --> 33:38.889
You thought I was
right behind you.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.327
Looks like we make
a pretty good team.

33:43.955 --> 33:45.901
- We do, don't we?
- Unh.

33:47.959 --> 33:49.961
Good. He's waking up.

33:50.328 --> 33:53.332
Maybe he can tell us
more lies about his daughter.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.470
How did you...?

33:58.970 --> 34:00.745
You weren't there.

34:00.906 --> 34:02.510
You remind me of her.

34:04.175 --> 34:05.882
I wasn't where?

34:06.711 --> 34:09.748
You weren't there
when Hatake told that story.

34:10.514 --> 34:12.016
They weren't my initials.

34:12.183 --> 34:14.754
So how do you explain
that it was your handwriting?

34:15.420 --> 34:18.525
Hallucinations are one
of the symptoms of the infection.

34:20.891 --> 34:21.996
No.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.167
That's not possible.

34:25.330 --> 34:26.831
I watched you do things.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.739
We need to tie something
around you for more pressure.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.176
Here. Use this.
Hurry up.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.443
Hurry UP-

34:39.543 --> 34:41.717
It was you, Jules.

34:43.114 --> 34:44.786
It was all you.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.292
All those times you saved me.

34:56.962 --> 34:58.532
You saved yourself.

35:54.119 --> 35:56.190
Hey. Coming through.
Switch clamps.

35:57.422 --> 36:01.495
You killed her, you bastard!
You have no idea what's going on here.

36:02.027 --> 36:03.700
Doreen was collateral damage.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.526
Nice knowing you, doc.

37:12.097 --> 37:13.872
Did Balleseros
come back through here?

37:14.032 --> 37:15.739
I haven't seen him.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.777
He attacked me on the ice.

37:17.936 --> 37:20.439
We need to get a security team
together, go after him.

37:20.605 --> 37:22.084
You don't need to do anything.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.050
You should have never been
on that ice in the first place.

37:25.210 --> 37:28.282
He killed Doreen.

37:29.013 --> 37:32.085
Well, it looks like
he almost killed you too.

37:42.927 --> 37:46.204
I've got a reply for that message.
Aah!

38:24.602 --> 38:25.910
Hold still.

38:26.070 --> 38:28.744
<i>Cleanup requested. Pantry, Level C.</i>

38:28.907 --> 38:31.353
<i>Cleanup requested. Pantry, Level C.</i>

38:31.509 --> 38:34.786
You know why I picked you
for my team, Sarah?

38:36.014 --> 38:38.324
Because I was the best candidate.

38:38.950 --> 38:41.089
Because you were driven.

38:42.120 --> 38:45.260
I remember the first day
you walked into my office...

38:46.191 --> 38:48.432
and I thought to myself:

38:48.593 --> 38:52.200
"That girl, even when she sleeps, she
tries to do it better than anyone else."

38:58.937 --> 39:01.474
Nothing distracts us from the work.

39:01.840 --> 39:05.310
That's the problem
with laser focus,

39:05.476 --> 39:08.013
with our particular way
of looking at the world.

39:10.381 --> 39:14.523
We only see the thing in front of us,
the thing under the microscope,

39:14.686 --> 39:17.530
and we miss
what's happening all around.

39:20.491 --> 39:22.869
That's why my marriage fell apart.

39:25.296 --> 39:30.712
That's why my brother
was up here in this place.

39:36.641 --> 39:39.315
I can't keep making
the same mistakes.

39:39.978 --> 39:43.357
I'm sorry I didn't listen
to you before...

39:44.415 --> 39:46.053
but I'm listening now.

39:50.421 --> 39:53.027
I get these migraines.

39:54.325 --> 39:58.330
I've had them since college,
and when they come on...

39:59.564 --> 40:04.946
I can't think, I can't work,
I can't do anything.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.908
I took some morphine
from the drug stockroom.

40:13.578 --> 40:17.788
I thought if I just had a little bit to even
me out, I'd be able to go back to work.

40:21.286 --> 40:24.756
I'm sorry. I've never done
anything like this, I swear.

40:25.957 --> 40:27.265
It's okay.

40:29.227 --> 40:34.301
We've all lost ourselves
a little bit here.

40:45.443 --> 40:49.755
My team has fallen apart.

40:50.715 --> 40:52.160
Again.

40:54.552 --> 40:58.557
I lost you and Jules last time.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.569
Now I've lost Doreen.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.144
I don't know what to do.

41:13.271 --> 41:15.945
You were always good
at that part.

41:17.108 --> 41:18.587
Even with Mom,

41:18.743 --> 41:22.816
on her worst days, you had hope.

41:36.194 --> 41:38.504
I need a little of your hope.

41:40.431 --> 41:42.433
Right now, Peter.

41:58.383 --> 42:01.159
