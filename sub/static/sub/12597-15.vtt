(grunts) Let me go, Daktron!

00:11.112 --> 00:12.177
Hey!

00:20.388 --> 00:22.221
Okay, we've gotta
get out of here.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.223
Daktron will reassemble
and come back for us.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.358
(bell rings)

00:27.328 --> 00:29.361
Cut! Nice scene.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.330
-Thank you.
-That's a quick ten, everyone.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.332
Since we have a break,
I'm gonna go find Maddie.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.034
Ooh!

00:35.036 --> 00:37.803
To talk about your first date?

00:37.805 --> 00:39.304
Ooh!

00:39.306 --> 00:41.206
Stop.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.877
Actually, don't stop.
I might do it myself.

00:44.879 --> 00:47.613
I have a date. Ooh!

00:50.551 --> 00:52.284
It is so no fun
teasing you.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.356
-Hey, Maddie.
-Hey!

00:57.358 --> 00:58.724
Big night tonight.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.660
Yeah. It's our, uh...
first date.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.862
What are we doing?

01:03.864 --> 01:07.332
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Remember you beat me at
Tree House H.O.R.S.E.

01:07.334 --> 01:09.501
Oh, yes. How could I forget?

01:09.503 --> 01:12.471
You are kind of adorable
when you're frozen in fear.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.541
Take that back.

01:15.543 --> 01:18.444
I am totally adorable
when I'm frozen in fear.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.345
Yeah. (laughs, snorts)

01:20.347 --> 01:22.614
You won, which means
you plan the date.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.384
-Right.
-Mm-hmm.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.920
Yes. I'm planning the date.

01:27.922 --> 01:31.223
Pfft, I mean you...
you better not also
be planning the date

01:31.225 --> 01:32.858
'cause like I'm the--
the planner.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.426
Cool.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.395
So, what are we doing?

01:36.397 --> 01:38.297
Oh, well...

01:38.299 --> 01:42.367
we are obviously having
the best first date in
the history of first dates.

01:42.369 --> 01:45.237
Uh, you know, I don't
usually do this before I do
something awesome,

01:45.239 --> 01:46.605
but bam! What?

01:48.375 --> 01:51.477
That, my good sir,
is a pre-bam, what.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.679
Which I mean is, like,
pretty much unprecedented.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.750
Don't bam-what
unless you plan
to back it up.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.620
Oh, I'mma back it up.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.690
(sing-songy)
I'mma back it up,
I'mma back it up.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.728
Wait, are we break dancing
or are we just backing it up?

02:09.730 --> 02:12.431
Because either way, I am so in.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.333
(sing-songy)
Now back it up,
now back it up.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.502
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay, Joey, Joey, Joey.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.139
I need your help.

02:20.141 --> 02:21.807
I love being helpful.

02:21.809 --> 02:26.311
So... I need your help...
planning my first date
with Josh.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.814
'Cause wh-- what does a guy
even wanna do on a first date?

02:28.816 --> 02:30.082
Oh.

02:30.084 --> 02:33.385
You've come to me
as an example of masculinity?

02:34.989 --> 02:37.022
Lemme just take
a second to blush.

02:42.129 --> 02:43.996
Okay. Okay.

02:43.998 --> 02:47.132
The two of you just need
some place where you can
be alone.

02:47.134 --> 02:50.269
Bonus points
for working in kitties
or a puppet show.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.006
Thank you, Joe.
That's good advice.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.507
You gonna do
the opposite of what I said?

02:55.509 --> 02:57.543
-I am.
-Whoo! I was helpful.

But Mr. Bell,
I can't fail a class.

That was the agreement
when I was promoted
to high school.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.561
They'll ship me back
to middle school.

04:56.563 --> 04:57.829
I can't go back there.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.998
They threw me a parade.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.902
Well, if you want to raise
your grade, you'll have to

05:03.904 --> 05:06.571
perform a solo at
the Porcu-Piper Pep Performance.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.042
In front of the whole school?

05:10.978 --> 05:12.077

you really know how
to plan a date.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.849
Say it. Say it!

06:23.851 --> 06:25.250
Bam! What?

06:27.221 --> 06:28.920
Yeah! I told you so.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.557
Hey! Three hot dogs
over here.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.227
I'm so sorry.
Did you want a hot dog?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.431
-Mother.
-Hm?

06:39.433 --> 06:40.832
With Dad away,

06:40.834 --> 06:42.534
you obviously need a break.

-Oh.
-So I'm taking over

06:44.004 --> 06:45.704
the household chore that you
hate the most.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.539
-Cleaning the bathrooms?
-Nope, that's gross.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.673

grocery shopping.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.278
-Really?
-Yep.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.013
I found an app
that gives us deals

06:55.015 --> 06:57.282
on everything
from apples to zucchinis.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.750
-Uh-huh.
-By the way,

06:58.752 --> 07:01.019
I am not buying zucchinis
because they are disgusting.

07:02.856 --> 07:06.758
Well, thank you, Joey.
I now have an afternoon free.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.261
I guess I could do my nails
or-- oh, take a bath,

07:09.263 --> 07:10.729
or read a book.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.030

will be my classroom.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.569
A toot toot!

07:52.272 --> 07:53.505
Should we ask about this?

07:53.507 --> 07:55.140
We're having us time,
don't get sucked in.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.145
Yeah, he just, uh,
opened your fireplace.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.847

Yo, Parker.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.849
What's, uh,
what's up, buddy?

08:03.851 --> 08:06.818
Well, I have chosen
to live the life of
a wandering genius.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.721
Solving crimes
and science problems
from town to town.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.757
Wow, I would totally
watch that show.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.126
But, um, why?

08:15.128 --> 08:17.162
Well, Mr. Bell's
giving me an F.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.997
What? How?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.166
No one gets an F
in Show Choir.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.701
And I don't wanna be
the first.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.536
So, tell Mom I love her.

08:24.538 --> 08:25.804
I'm out.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.507
Okay, wait.
What if Liv and I tutored you?

08:28.509 --> 08:32.777
(gasps) Babe, this could be
our first talent makeover
as a couple!

08:32.779 --> 08:33.845
Oh. (chuckles heartily)

08:33.847 --> 08:36.748
Let's get that kid an A,
Show Choir style.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.119
Liv:
All right, Parker,

08:41.121 --> 08:42.854
on the path to mastering
show choir,

08:42.856 --> 08:44.189
there are three 'P's.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.024
What are those three 'P's,
you may ask.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.058
-Hm?
-Well...

08:47.060 --> 08:49.160
Oh, there's a song
to help you remember.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.696
-Both: ♪ When you feel ♪
-Stop.

08:54.001 --> 08:57.168
Yeah, this isn't gonna
work for me if you're just
gonna burst into song.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.637
Ha! I mean, that's...

08:58.639 --> 09:00.839
-Kind of...
-Both: ...the point
of show choir.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.641
-But...
-Well...

09:02.643 --> 09:04.910
then if you'll excuse me,
I need to hop on the 6:15
to Minnetonka.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.678
-Okay.
-Okay, okay, okay.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.213
We'll just say it.
Ugh.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.216
The first 'P' is pizazz.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.319
Wow.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.258
You keep a sparkle hat
in your case?

09:21.895 --> 09:24.829
I got an A
in Show Choir.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.768
All right, the second 'P'
is precision.

09:34.508 --> 09:36.107
And the third 'P' is--

09:36.109 --> 09:37.609
Put a sock in it?

09:37.611 --> 09:38.944
No.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.345
Look, I don't do
this kind of stuff.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.746
I'm a man of science.

09:43.250 --> 09:47.285
Well, did you know
that Einstein used to tap dance?

09:47.287 --> 09:48.753
Yeah.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.923
And that Steve Jobs used to sing
in a barbershop quartet?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.758
And Heisenberg, I think,
did needlepoint?

09:53.760 --> 09:56.861
I mean, scientists don't just
do science, you know?

09:56.863 --> 09:58.797
Great minds have
diverse interests.

10:00.601 --> 10:01.900
I made all that up.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.768

all this toilet paper?

really down when

Our date went great.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.212

15:14.214 --> 15:16.080
hit a home run ball
and I caught it.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.348
Uh-huh.

And when you caught the ball,
what was Josh doing?

-And you...

15:23.256 --> 15:26.691

-Oh.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.462
Ugh. I ruined our date.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.798
And then you preserved it
in Plexiglass.

15:35.735 --> 15:36.901
Well,

15:36.903 --> 15:38.636
I mean, I just caught
the ball on instinct.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.238
I mean, you know
how competitive I am.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.073
Oh, yeah, I know.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.442
Remember how you got
the last bowl of oatmeal
this morning?

15:46.446 --> 15:48.246
Shoved you out of the way?

15:48.248 --> 15:49.480
Yes.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.149
Yes, you did.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.051
So, I had to eat
a lemon.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.255
Oh, what do I do?

15:57.257 --> 15:58.790
I really, really like Josh.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.391
Like, I really like Josh.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.727
The last thing that I want
to do is make him feel bad.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.129
Well, maybe you should,
oh, I don't know,

16:05.131 --> 16:07.532
be a teeny bit less competitive.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.435
So...

16:10.437 --> 16:12.470
to be in a relationship,

16:12.472 --> 16:14.906
I have to give up winning?

16:14.908 --> 16:18.977
You know, sometimes making
somebody else feel good
is the win.

16:21.915 --> 16:24.682
Joe, did you just
say something meaningful?

16:24.684 --> 16:26.417
You know, I believe I did.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.821
Excuse me while I...

16:29.823 --> 16:32.090
(sing-songy)
back it up, and slide.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.992

16:38.598 --> 16:39.630

16:39.632 --> 16:41.532

16:41.534 --> 16:43.501
See, Mother?
I listened.

16:44.437 --> 16:47.205
Good job, Joey.
You solved a problem...

16:47.207 --> 16:48.740
that you created.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.943
How'd you do it?

16:51.945 --> 16:54.879
You know, they say
we've only unlocked
10 percent of our brains,

16:54.881 --> 16:59.217
but I say we've only
unlocked 10 percent of
our toilet paper usage.

17:01.321 --> 17:04.355
That mug is way too hot
for my delicate lady fingers.

17:05.658 --> 17:09.260
But not with the
toilet paper tea mittens.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.398
Or you could just,
you know, use the handle
that's on the mug.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.365
Oh.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.035
What a great idea.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.070
I think I'll jot that down...

17:19.072 --> 17:21.706
on my T.P. notepad.

17:21.708 --> 17:25.243
So how'd you get rid of it?
Did you return it?

17:25.245 --> 17:28.346
They wouldn't let me return it,
but I did exchange it.

17:28.348 --> 17:29.580
For what?

17:30.517 --> 17:32.884
800 bales of hay.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.288
What have I done?

18:11.024 --> 18:12.423
Don't be weird, Josh.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.359
No, it's cool.
Go ahead.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.833
It's like he's smuggling
a baseball in there.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.302
Okay.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.703
Hey, sorry about him.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.306
You're just, like,
his all-time favorite player.

18:28.308 --> 18:31.175
Well, actually, I'm a huge
<i>Voltage</i> fan. Could I get
your autograph?

18:32.579 --> 18:34.345
Easy, Brandon Crawford.
Don't be so needy.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.382
(stutters) I'm just kidding,
I'm just kidding.

18:38.384 --> 18:40.451
Of course you can have
an autograph. You can have
whatever you want.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.286

18:50.430 --> 18:52.430
Yeah, um, you know what,
you can get his autograph after.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.397
How's that?

18:53.399 --> 18:55.766
After what? What's going on?

18:55.768 --> 18:57.468
Uh, well...

18:57.470 --> 18:58.769
I...

18:58.771 --> 19:01.405
sort of robbed you
of your chance

19:01.407 --> 19:03.474
to catch a home run
from your favorite player,

19:03.476 --> 19:05.243
so I just...

19:05.245 --> 19:08.212
you know, wanted to give you
a chance to catch one.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.314
Maddie...

19:10.316 --> 19:12.316
this is really sweet.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.687

Yes!

19:25.465 --> 19:26.397
Way to go, Josh.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.167
Okay, what was that?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.503
What do you mean?
That was, you know,

19:32.505 --> 19:35.840
you fulfilling a dream
and me not getting in the way.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.441
Brandon:
Can I get your autograph now?

19:37.443 --> 19:39.510
One second, B-Craw!

19:44.884 --> 19:46.384
Well, you gotta
make me earn it.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.022
But I thought
you were all upset

19:51.024 --> 19:53.457
because I was,
like, too competitive.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.993
That's not why
I was upset.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.963
I was upset because
I'm just as competitive.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.366
Every time we hang out,
you beat me at something.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.135
Basketball,
Tree House H.O.R.S.E...

20:04.137 --> 20:06.304
-Cowbell.
-Almost forgot
about that one.

20:08.374 --> 20:11.142
I thought when you took
me to the ball park,

20:11.144 --> 20:13.010
I figured that was
my moment to shine.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.345
(both chuckle)

20:14.347 --> 20:17.481
Ooh, you wanted
to impress me.

20:17.483 --> 20:19.517
Yeah, I did.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.219
-And I'm gonna.
-Ooh.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.555
But it doesn't count
unless you're trying
just as hard as I am.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.591
Don't ever turn off
your competitive fire.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.559
It's one of the things
I like most about you.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.562
(chuckles)

20:33.666 --> 20:35.466
(sing-songy)
You like me.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.404
-How cool is that?
-(chuckles)

20:40.406 --> 20:41.739
But prepare to be crushed.
