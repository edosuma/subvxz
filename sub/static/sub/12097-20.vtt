20:22.487 --> 20:24.989
You've got a son down there,
Timothy Flotsky.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.490
He's yours,
and he's nobody else's,

20:26.491 --> 20:28.492
and he's in trouble.

20:28.493 --> 20:33.998
So quit hiding in your cave,
and get off your... mountain,

20:33.999 --> 20:36.000
and... and come down
and help your son.

20:36.001 --> 20:37.501
And maybe then
you'll have your chance

20:37.502 --> 20:39.504
of making your peace with God.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.015
Let's go.

20:52.017 --> 20:55.020
Just help me lock up the cave.

21:02.027 --> 21:03.027
Come on, Danny.

21:03.028 --> 21:05.529
What's going on down there?

21:05.530 --> 21:07.531
Nothing.

21:07.532 --> 21:10.034
Even the ducks are gone.
That's it.

21:36.061 --> 21:39.563
Guess what? Wrong house.

21:39.564 --> 21:41.065
I almost got shot
anyway, though,

21:41.066 --> 21:43.067
because I kicked in the door
to surprise them,

21:43.068 --> 21:44.068
and wound up surprising

21:44.069 --> 21:45.570
some guy and his girlfriends.

21:48.073 --> 21:50.575
Something, uh, something
the matter, Burt?

21:52.077 --> 21:53.077
Did you see it?

21:53.078 --> 21:56.080
I saw enough to get
that guy pretty upset.

21:56.081 --> 21:57.581
No, no, no, no.

21:57.582 --> 21:59.083
The spaceship.

21:59.084 --> 22:00.084
Did you see that spaceship?

22:00.085 --> 22:01.085
What?

22:01.086 --> 22:03.587
What, what?
The spaceship.

22:03.588 --> 22:05.589
It was right over there.

22:05.590 --> 22:07.091
A spaceship.

No, Burt.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.600

Dan, I never saw
anything like it.

22:18.603 --> 22:19.603
I mean, the lights,
the noise, it...

22:19.604 --> 22:21.606
It started the truck.

22:23.108 --> 22:24.608
You were dreaming, Burt.

22:24.609 --> 22:26.610
Danny, please, what are you
talking about, dreaming?

22:26.611 --> 22:27.611
I was standing right here.

22:27.612 --> 22:30.114
All right, you fell asleep,
and you dreamed it.

22:30.115 --> 22:32.116
Danny, I was awake.

22:32.117 --> 22:33.117
I was not dreaming.

22:33.118 --> 22:34.118
I saw it.

22:34.119 --> 22:35.620
It was... here, Danny.

22:37.122 --> 22:38.622
Hey, but, Danny, believe me,

22:38.623 --> 22:41.125
I wouldn't kid you
about something like this.

22:41.126 --> 22:43.128
I saw a spaceship.

22:44.629 --> 22:47.631

What home?
We can't go home. No.

22:56.141 --> 22:57.641
They might come back.

No, we've got to go home
and get some help.

that helped you

23:04.649 --> 23:06.150
when you thought
you were invisible.

23:06.151 --> 23:07.652
Maybe he's good
with spaceships too.

23:08.653 --> 23:09.653
We don't need a doctor.

23:09.654 --> 23:11.656
