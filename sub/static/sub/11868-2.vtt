Ooh!
Thanks, 20.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.926
Still need a ride
to school tomorrow?

00:13.096 --> 00:14.882
Isn't that what
boyfriends are for?

00:17.559 --> 00:20.847
Miss! Can I get
a warm-up over here?

00:22.648 --> 00:24.013
So you don't?

00:24.608 --> 00:26.690
Just being an
attentive waitress.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.649
Yeah, just don't be
too attentive.

00:28.779 --> 00:29.894
Helps me get tips.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.863
Not the kind of tips
I want you getting.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.282
What's the matter, Sheriff?
You don't like the food?

00:39.414 --> 00:43.373
No. It's great.
I just don't have much
of an appetite.

00:43.502 --> 00:46.915
You thinking about Allison
getting married to Stark?

00:47.673 --> 00:51.586
I am now.
No, it's
the Henry situation.

00:51.802 --> 00:54.259
I've sent him care packages,
but security won't
let them through.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.424
You know, I can't think
of anything worse

00:56.557 --> 00:59.173
than eating prison food
for the rest of your life.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.847
I mean, other than
being in prison
for the rest of your life.

01:02.980 --> 01:06.893
For me, itjust
doesn't seem right
without him around.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.731
Feels like the whole
town's out of balance.

01:08.860 --> 01:09.849
(GLASS SHATTERING)

01:15.284 --> 01:16.990
See what I mean?

01:20.747 --> 01:22.032
A hiring freeze
is one thing,

01:22.165 --> 01:24.292
but cutting 75 jobs
is quite another.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.329
We've got to start saving
somewhere, Doctor.

01:26.461 --> 01:27.746
Start?

01:27.879 --> 01:30.370
You will decimate entire
disciplines here at G.D.

01:30.507 --> 01:33.123
Leaving everyone wondering
who's gonna be next.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.718
Look, I came here to make
G.D. a lean and commercially
productive machine.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.087
It's what I do.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.509
Now, there are gonna be some
changes here and in town.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.303
And while I appreciate
the lively discourse,

01:42.436 --> 01:44.927
let's try to remember
that while I'm here,
I am the boss.

01:45.314 --> 01:47.805
Which is for how
much longer, again?

01:48.066 --> 01:51.934
Till l'm successful.
And I do hope you're
still here to see me go.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.028
So change means
firing people?
Just so I have that straight.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.990
Not necessarily.
Take a look at this.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.370
Look what Santa brought me.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.954

Global Dynamics consumer
research products lab.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.041
And this is its new director.

02:11.882 --> 02:12.962
Zane?

02:13.675 --> 02:16.712
He's a risk taker with
cross-discipline experience.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.836
Yeah, the words
Zane and discipline

02:18.972 --> 02:21.008
tend not to go together
in the same sentence.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.089
This place is
gonna be awesome.

02:23.226 --> 02:26.309
Miss Thorne's given
me a blank check
to hire anyone I want.

02:26.772 --> 02:28.512
Buy any equipment that I need.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.231
If we're cutting costs,
how can we afford
the startup on this?

02:31.360 --> 02:33.567
Corporate synergy, of course.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.774
If we come up with
a hot product in here,

02:39.910 --> 02:42.401
maybe Miss Thorne won't have
to make so many cutbacks.

thick enough to hold a
dangerous criminal like me.

Did I tell you
everyone says hi?
Vince. Zoe.

03:34.923 --> 03:38.006
Yeah. Yeah, you did.
Yeah, I appreciate it.
Thanks.

03:41.805 --> 03:42.885
You okay?

03:44.015 --> 03:45.141
Yeah.

03:46.893 --> 03:50.636
You know what,
why don't you tell me about

03:52.691 --> 03:53.976

I'll see about that sunset.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.943
Lab 27. I'll show you.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.655
So how you been?

04:47.788 --> 04:48.948
Great. Great. Yeah.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.280
You?
Great. Really great.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.532
Good.

Is the wedding planning
keeping you busy?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.918
Do you really want to know?

05:06.056 --> 05:07.341
So the 911 is...

05:07.474 --> 05:09.590
Missing person.
He's been gone two days,

05:09.726 --> 05:13.014
a scientist in lab 27
named Bob Nobb.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.014
His name's
really Bob Nobb?

05:18.151 --> 05:19.652
Did you check in his house?

05:19.778 --> 05:22.941
He lives in the lab.
Okay. You check
under his cot?

05:23.240 --> 05:25.572
I'm afraid it's
not that simple.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.112
No, it never is.

05:30.121 --> 05:34.330
So lab 27's been in
operation for 11 years.
I've been director for two.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.995
Since the beginning,
of course.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.590
He have any
favorite hangouts?
Places he liked to go?

05:43.718 --> 05:44.878
You didn't explain?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.547
l was getting to that.

05:46.972 --> 05:49.759
Okay. Lab 27
is a sealed biosphere.

05:49.891 --> 05:53.884
A self-sustaining ecosystem
designed to research and
support the Mars missions.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.762
You do mean
the potential Mars missions.

05:56.898 --> 05:57.887
Right.

05:59.234 --> 06:00.815
I mean, right.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.405
And how long has
Bob been in there for?

06:04.531 --> 06:05.941
Eleven years.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.359
Eleven years?
Yeah.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.108
Well, along with
nine other researchers.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.486
What kind of people do that?

06:13.498 --> 06:16.740
I think a life
dedicated to science
and sacrifice is quite noble.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.913
I actually applied to
join the team myself.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.876
Well, congratulations.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.750
Well, I wasn't chosen, so...

That's why I'm
congratulating you.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.131

Yes.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.922
So, ten people
in there for 11 years

06:28.054 --> 06:29.669
and no one's come in
and out in all that time?

06:29.806 --> 06:31.012
No. No one.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.218
It's gonna be
a walk in the park.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.722
Well, see for yourself.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.316
That's a big park.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.772
So lab 27 is a 12,000-acre,
closed ecological system

07:21.900 --> 07:23.856
located a half a mile
below us.

07:23.985 --> 07:28.103
Inside is a 850-square-meter
lake, a savanna grassland,

07:28.239 --> 07:30.730
a rainforest where the
human habitat is located.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.949

it underground?

07:37.332 --> 07:39.243

monitored from right here.

what exactly?

07:44.005 --> 07:46.917
Priceless information
about creating
a balanced environment.

07:47.050 --> 07:52.295
You and l have a very
different definition
of priceless and balance.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.588
I don't think now is
the time to discuss budget.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.215
No, no, why don't
you guys duke it out
while I go take a look inside?

07:57.352 --> 07:58.558
Well, you can't go
inside, Carter.

07:58.687 --> 08:01.349
Entering the lab is a total
violation of protocol.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.346
Sorry, but I have to find out
if someone knows anything

08:03.483 --> 08:04.848
about the disappearance
of Bob Nobb.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.600
And I can't do that
without talking to them.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.601
No, we have cameras, monitors.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.194
You can interview
anyone you want
from right here.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.905
It's not the same.
It'd be better if it was
face to face.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.366
I agree with you, Sheriff.
I think you should
enter the lab,

08:15.495 --> 08:17.235
and you should take
Dr. Blake with you.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.327
What? Why?
VVhy?

08:18.456 --> 08:19.741
Well, because while
you're doing yourjob,

08:19.874 --> 08:23.241
you can help justify
why we're not filling in
this giant money pit.

08:39.978 --> 08:42.185

mention that.

contaminate the lab.

Is there any reason
we need to do this together?

Not really. No.

Putting our greatest
human assets at risk
is quite another.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.996
I had no idea you cared that
much about Sheriff Carter.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.920
I'll run point on this.
I know the lab.
I know the protocols.

10:37.262 --> 10:40.379
I'm sure you have
better things to do
than stare at the monitors.

What do you smell?

10:55.989 --> 10:58.947

Maybe some fertilizer.

right, how real it seems?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.485
Is it real?

Well, the animals

But the clouds
and the breeze,
the way day turns to night,

11:10.295 --> 11:12.957
all of it's created
in the control room to
maintain a balance

11:13.089 --> 11:15.922

11:49.500 --> 11:52.082
Hijacking the internal

Bootlegging the feed.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.294
That doesn't sound like
something you should be doing.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.129
It's totally "not" something
I should be doing.

11:57.258 --> 12:00.000
But it's lab 27,
mother of all reality shows.

12:00.136 --> 12:03.674
I used to hack into it
when I was an intern.
It was like my Barney.

That's how we bonded.

about Bob's disappearance.

But some people are wondering
if you coming inside means
the end of the experiment.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.196
Would that be a bad thing?

leave, which they don't.

I'm not sure, but I think
that some of these
plant strains are extinct.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.832
That's Bob's garden.
He was really proud of it.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.879
So he had a green thumb.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.512
What else can you
tell us about him?

12:43.638 --> 12:44.923
No one liked him very much.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.045
Oh.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.723
Rick and Laura Wallace.
We're team co-directors.
Teri's parents.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.645
Allison Blake.
This is Jack Carter.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.359
Yeah, we know who
you are, Dr. Blake.
Hi.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.024
Abe Jensen,
integrated systems.
Hi.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.898
Hi.
We're here about
your friend Bob.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.945
Just because we live together
doesn't mean we're friends.

13:07.078 --> 13:08.067
Abe, please.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.661
Well, I take it you've had
some problems with Bob.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.156
Just seems he's
always sticking it
where it doesn't belong.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.205
Right.
Go ahead. Ask if
anyone misses him.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.373
Okay.
Does anyone miss Bob?

13:25.305 --> 13:26.761
Not really.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.931
Any idea what might've
happened to him?

13:32.395 --> 13:34.852
Are there any hazards around
here I should know about?

13:34.981 --> 13:37.893
Abandoned wells, wood
chippers, dangerous animals.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.017
No. No. No. No predators.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.565
I mean, we have a hard
enough time as it is
maintaining the balance

13:42.697 --> 13:45.564
down here without one
lab animal eating the others.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.689
(SCREAMING)

13:47.410 --> 13:48.741
Teri?

13:49.954 --> 13:52.991
CARTER: Teri! Teri!
ALLISON: Teri!

13:53.124 --> 13:54.864
WOMAN 1: Teri!
MAN 1: Teri, where are you?

13:55.001 --> 13:56.116
Teri!

13:56.544 --> 13:57.624
MAN 2: Teri!

13:58.713 --> 13:59.873
WOMAN 2: Teri!

14:01.007 --> 14:02.292
RICK: Over here!

14:02.925 --> 14:05.462
Teri. Over here!

14:07.805 --> 14:09.761
I think she just fainted.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.222
Are you okay?
I'm okay.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.716
It went that way.

14:12.852 --> 14:13.841
ALLISON: It?

14:13.978 --> 14:15.218
(TERI PANTING)

14:21.194 --> 14:22.479
Carter.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.078
What is it?
It's Bob's uniform.

14:41.005 --> 14:41.994
(GASPS)

14:42.673 --> 14:44.538
What the hell was that?

14:48.137 --> 14:51.550
I don't know,
but it went into
that hole.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.849
No predators, huh?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.494
Hey, guys.
ALL: Shh!

15:16.040 --> 15:18.076
What are we watching?

15:19.168 --> 15:20.328
My dad.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.497
ALLISON: We need to
talk to Nathan.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.962
He's gonna be okay
in there, right?

15:30.638 --> 15:31.844
Allie, I want you
out of there.

15:31.973 --> 15:34.055
I'm fine, Nathan.
Don't worry.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.764
Teri, are you okay?

15:35.893 --> 15:39.761
I'm okay, Derek. Really.
I don't even know
what I saw exactly.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.354
All right, well, tell me
about the hole this thing
climbed into.

15:42.483 --> 15:47.193
It was a slippery hole.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.358
And this was inside it.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.528
It's Bob's
and whatever
left it got away.

15:53.953 --> 15:58.413
All right, that's it.
I'm initiating evacuation and
shutdown scenario right now.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.826
Great. Where do we go?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.665
NATHAN: Well, unfortunately,
it's not that easy.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.410
After ten years,
the residents' immune systems
have changed.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.957
We can sterilize you
to go in,

16:06.090 --> 16:09.332
but we can't sterilize
the world for them
coming out.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.960
It's gonna take
a transition facility.
And that's gonna take time.

16:12.096 --> 16:15.259
All right, in the meantime,
can you tell us what this
stuff is?

16:15.391 --> 16:18.007
We're uplinking the chemical
components right now,

16:18.144 --> 16:20.430
but it's gonna take some
time for the results.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.394
We'll try to get
some of our own.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.823
My, how homey.

16:34.952 --> 16:38.490
Oh, Miss Thorne.
What brings you here?

16:38.623 --> 16:40.830
This. I need your
help on something.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.823
Institutional changes
here in town

16:42.960 --> 16:46.123
that will put Eureka
on a secure financial footing.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.916
Shouldn't this wait for
Sheriff Carter?

16:48.049 --> 16:49.789
Sheriff Carter's
got his hands full.

16:49.926 --> 16:52.713
Based on your record,
I know that you're up
to the challenge.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.837
Well, thanks, but...
Credit where credit's due.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.347
"No more free
food at Cafe Diem."

17:03.940 --> 17:04.929
"Parking meter
installation"?

17:05.066 --> 17:06.977
I'm afraid
the free ride is over.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.645
"Fees for library cards"?

17:08.778 --> 17:10.939
Just the cards.
The books are still free.

17:11.072 --> 17:12.903
"Closing the museum."

17:13.908 --> 17:15.819
I didn't even know
Eureka had a museum.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.783
My point exactly.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.112
Okay.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.782
Snake catching gear, huh?

17:23.918 --> 17:27.627
Well, we're a pretty
resourceful bunch,
but that's a test.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.458
You guys even have
snakes down here?

17:29.590 --> 17:30.670
Over 20 varieties,

17:30.800 --> 17:33.291
but nothing more
dangerous than your
common garter snake.

17:33.427 --> 17:37.261
And no animal experiments
that maybe got out of control?

17:37.682 --> 17:40.845
Sheriff, we're not the
island of Dr. Moreau.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.217
Well, you're not an island.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.594
Look, I don't know
what they've told you
about our team,

17:44.730 --> 17:46.140
but we're not
a bunch of amateurs.

17:46.274 --> 17:47.980
I mean, we take our
research very seriously

17:48.109 --> 17:51.852
and it's a project that
we really believe in.
I mean, this is our moon shot.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.853
Even Teri's enthusiastic
about the mission

17:53.990 --> 17:56.151
and she's been down here
since she was a kid.

17:56.284 --> 17:59.651
And what about Bob?
You guys don't seem too
enthusiastic about him.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.243
You sense that?

18:01.372 --> 18:02.487
Yeah.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.786
Well, that's his desk,
right over there.

18:05.918 --> 18:06.907
Huh.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.667
What's his specialty?

18:08.796 --> 18:10.752
Sustainable agriculture.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.667
And, apparently, women.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.140
Huh.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.089
That's your wife.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.059
Guy made a run
at everything in a skirt.

18:25.479 --> 18:29.142
In the last couple of months,
he seemed to take a shine
to my daughter Teri.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.856
Did that come up?
Did you guys
talk about that?

18:30.985 --> 18:32.566
You bet I did.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.945
He denied it, of course.
But I caught her
a couple of times

18:36.073 --> 18:37.859
coming back from his
garden all dreamy-eyed.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.449
Said she'd been
"watching clouds."

18:40.995 --> 18:44.863
(SIGHS) Just the thought
of him trying something
with her makes me...

18:47.835 --> 18:49.075
Yeah, well.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.085
Monofilament netting.

18:54.050 --> 18:58.339
Very high tensile strength.
This should be good.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.962
So, no dangerous animals.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.134
No crazy experiments.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.928
That leaves people.
Mmm.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.895
Could someone have
engineered some sort of
predator and sicced it on him?

19:09.023 --> 19:10.183
Maybe somebody with a grudge?

19:10.316 --> 19:13.604
Sheriff, if I think of
anything, I'll let you know.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.832
NATHAN: I miss you.
How you doing?

19:37.968 --> 19:41.256
I'm safe, I promise.
I miss you, too.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.051
How's Carter doing?

19:44.517 --> 19:47.054
No, actually,
Carter's doing fine.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.351
Of course,
I would tell you
if he was...

19:52.900 --> 19:53.935
Carter.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.308
So, you're not just here to
take a look at the lab,

19:55.444 --> 19:56.900
you're here to
keep an eye on me.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.065
No. Yes.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.359
Assuming this
is Stark's idea.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.073
Not at all.
No. Mmm-hmm.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.238
Okay, Carter,
it was my idea, okay?

20:05.371 --> 20:06.736
When Thorne
brought out the chart

20:06.872 --> 20:09.739
with all the red dots
showing how exciting things
had gotten in town

20:09.875 --> 20:12.412
since you showed up,
she was concerned.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.827
And so were you.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.919
Not about you. For you.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.085
I'm trying to
protect you, Carter.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.173
What are you gonna
protect me from?

20:20.302 --> 20:22.793
The prehistoric plants?
Giant, man-eating snake?

20:22.930 --> 20:24.431
From Thorne.

20:25.683 --> 20:28.095
Not sure she's the one
I'm worried about right now.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.891
Oh, my goodness.
What did I miss?

20:34.024 --> 20:36.936
My dad hunting for
the creature from
the Black Lagoon.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.855
You gotta admit,
the injection of new talent

20:38.988 --> 20:40.398
has really made this
show fresh again.

20:40.531 --> 20:43.147
So which one of
the scientists
is the red herring?

20:43.284 --> 20:46.947
Do you think the arrival
of Sheriff Carter has
made it more procedural?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.661
No, no, no.
That was the switch up.

20:51.959 --> 20:52.914
(SIGHS)

20:53.419 --> 20:56.456
Grace. Other than,
obviously, Teri,

20:56.589 --> 20:59.001
you're the only other
single woman down here, right?

20:59.133 --> 21:00.919
Actually, yeah.

21:01.051 --> 21:03.087
Nice of you to notice.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.386
Well, and did
Bob Nobb notice?

21:06.640 --> 21:08.176
Well, of course.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.387
He and I were
a bit of an item.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.266
Is that before
or after Laura?

21:15.399 --> 21:16.980
Or the girl
with the curly hair?

21:17.109 --> 21:20.272
You saw his pictures.
Yes, those were hard to miss.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.688
I was with Bob as
long as anybody else.

21:24.492 --> 21:27.484
Three or four times,
actually, over the years.

21:27.912 --> 21:30.995
Until it was time to
rotate the crops, which...

21:31.957 --> 21:33.993
That's what he called it.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.991
Nice.
Yeah.

21:37.588 --> 21:40.751
Always with the stupid
agricultural euphemisms.

21:40.883 --> 21:41.872
(CHUCKLING)

21:42.009 --> 21:42.839
Pretty stupid.

21:42.968 --> 21:43.957
(SIGHS)

21:44.094 --> 21:45.959
And I can't tell you
the number of days

21:46.096 --> 21:48.633
I just wanted to just plow
him under, you know...

21:48.766 --> 21:50.256
And what's your specialty?

21:50.392 --> 21:51.768
Genetics.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.894
I really need to
get back to work.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.433
Yeah.
Okay.

22:26.136 --> 22:28.548
Carter,
I just came in to call you.
How'd you know?

22:28.681 --> 22:30.842
I didn't.
I just hit redial.

22:30.975 --> 22:33.887
Well, we got the results
back on the substance
on Bob's shoe.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.975
We had to run them twice
'cause we couldn't believe it.

22:36.105 --> 22:37.595
So what's the verdict?

22:37.731 --> 22:40.108
Human. Kind of.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.103
Human, kind of?

22:45.239 --> 22:46.854
I'm gonna regret this.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.277
NATHAN: Carter!
Carter, what is it?

22:55.207 --> 22:56.822
I can't watch.

23:09.305 --> 23:10.715
(GRUNTING)

23:11.056 --> 23:12.512
(PANTING)

23:12.725 --> 23:14.010
Bob?

23:19.064 --> 23:20.349
Help me.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.822
NATHAN: You're not
ordering a lockdown.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.487
Did you see what
they caught in there?

23:32.620 --> 23:34.827
The woman I'm going
to marry is in there.

23:34.955 --> 23:37.947
For all you know,
there could be a contagious
mutation as well.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.994
You're not a scientist,
you don't know what
you're talking about.

23:43.505 --> 23:46.247
is both the safest course
of action and the best way
for us to find out

23:46.383 --> 23:49.875
what the hell is
going on in there.
And you know it, too.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.218
I'm sorry.

23:52.806 --> 23:53.795
NATHAN: Why is it raining?

23:55.059 --> 23:56.390
I started it per schedule.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.099
Well, shut it off.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.144
No need to make them
any more miserable.

24:08.030 --> 24:09.816
ALLISON: I could barely
get the needle through
his skin.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.610
What's happening
to him anyway?

24:11.742 --> 24:14.233
Loss of sebaceous glands.
High keratin levels.

24:14.370 --> 24:17.533
There's a condition called
ichthyosis vulgaris.

24:17.665 --> 24:19.326
Fish scale disease.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.453
I guess it could
look like this, but...

24:21.585 --> 24:24.952
N0 disease would do this
to his DNA. Not to
the extent we're seeing.

24:25.089 --> 24:26.124
All right. Then what would?

24:26.256 --> 24:27.541
Atavism.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.923
Evolution in reverse.

24:30.052 --> 24:31.292
Explain.

24:32.054 --> 24:34.386
Ninety percent of our DNA is
believed to be dormant,

24:34.515 --> 24:37.257
left over from when we all
shared common ancestors.

24:37.393 --> 24:40.851
Atavism is the reappearance
of traces that have
disappeared.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.143
Hind legs on whales.
Vestigial tails on babies.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.651
Or snake parts on Bob Nobb?

24:46.777 --> 24:50.565
Apparently.
We all carry genes that are
identical to those in fish,

24:50.698 --> 24:54.190
birds, reptiles,
but that DNA's
believed to be dormant.

24:54.868 --> 24:55.948
Until now.

24:56.078 --> 24:58.535
All right.
Assuming we go with that,
how would it happen?

24:58.664 --> 25:00.200
NATHAN: Closed
environment down there.

25:00.332 --> 25:04.041
The ecosystem must've gotten
knocked out of whack and just
continued to self-reinforce.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.242
Huh.

25:05.421 --> 25:07.878
Okay. Is there a specialist
up there we can talk to?

25:08.007 --> 25:10.498
Yeah. I knowjust the guy.
Worked on the shuttle team.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.374
Developed their life
support system for the lab.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.547
And genetics happen to be
one of his sub-specialties.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.921
I've told you nobody else
is entering the lab.

25:17.057 --> 25:19.594
Well, it doesn't matter.
That person is Henry.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.600
We're on our own.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.686
Not necessarily.

25:29.570 --> 25:30.980
Nathan.
Henry.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.571
I'm not forgetting
what you did at G.D.,

25:34.700 --> 25:36.907
but that's a conversation
for another day.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.948
I'm gonna set that
aside right now because
Global needs your help.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.820
I don't see
how I can provide that.

25:41.957 --> 25:44.994
As much as I hate to admit it,
Sheriff Carter had an idea.

25:57.473 --> 25:58.588
Hey.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.092
Hey.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.767
Look, I just wanted to
apologize for earlier.

26:03.896 --> 26:04.976
Oh, forget it.

26:05.105 --> 26:08.893
Look, with everything
going on at Global and
Thorne showing up,

26:09.651 --> 26:13.109
some days I just don't know
if I'm coming or going.
Literally.

26:13.739 --> 26:14.728
Um...

26:14.907 --> 26:17.740
No worries. I can relate.

26:18.368 --> 26:20.825
And I know you don't need me
to protect you from
prehistoric plants.

26:20.954 --> 26:25.869
(LAUGHING) No. But if
you could teach me about
self-contained biosystems,

26:26.001 --> 26:27.411
that would be great.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.500
Well, maybe I could
help you with that.

26:30.964 --> 26:33.046
Oh! Now that's what
I call a switch up!

26:33.592 --> 26:35.128
Henry, how are...

26:35.844 --> 26:36.924
(LAUGHING)

26:40.849 --> 26:41.964
Hologram.

26:42.101 --> 26:46.595
I thought of the one that
Zane made of me and...
I'm just glad you have pants.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.393
Next screen.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.187
Will this tell us
what's changing Bob?

26:52.319 --> 26:54.901
Maybe, if it's part
of the ecosystem,
which I find doubtful.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.531
Is that diagnostic run
complete?

26:56.657 --> 26:58.318
ALLISON:
Bringing it up.
CARTER: Why doubtful?

26:58.450 --> 27:00.782
Well, if the system
was contaminated enough
to do what it did to Bob,

27:00.911 --> 27:02.947
people would've
gotten sick years ago.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.241
Well, what if the contaminant
wasn't in the system
years ago?

27:05.374 --> 27:06.989
Carter, it's a closed system.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.912
Well, people keep
saying that,
but we're here.

27:09.837 --> 27:10.952
That's not right.

27:11.088 --> 27:11.873
What?
HENRY: The water.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.870
The ionization
levels are way off.

27:14.550 --> 27:17.087
(STAMMERING) Could that...
Alter DNA? Absolutely.

27:17.219 --> 27:18.925
Ionization of the water
produces free radicals

27:19.054 --> 27:21.636
which can target
accelerated mutations.

27:21.765 --> 27:24.928
So Bob's being changed
into a snake by the water?

27:25.060 --> 27:27.597
It may not be
isolated to just Bob.

27:29.189 --> 27:31.976
Well, no. With recycling...
It's the rain?

27:32.109 --> 27:33.599
Can we reverse it?

27:33.735 --> 27:34.770
We can purge the system,

27:34.903 --> 27:37.770
but we can't reverse
the changes that are
already undenNay.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.408
TERI: Sheriff Carter?

27:42.744 --> 27:44.996
Could you look
under my shirt?

27:46.707 --> 27:49.039
(STAMMERING)
No, I...
Please?

27:56.508 --> 27:58.920
It's happening
to the others, too.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.543
So the two of us?

28:02.055 --> 28:03.386
I'd say it's just
a matter of time.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.640
NATHAN: It was the water,
all right.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.858
Something or
someone changed it.

28:16.987 --> 28:21.981
What you guys are witnessing
is the first ever demonstrated
case of macro de-evolution.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.948
Can you see the variation
in the mutations?

28:24.494 --> 28:27.236
Yes, and whatever it is,
it's affecting the entire
genome.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.328
How long does it take
to affect the genome?

28:29.458 --> 28:32.950
I jury-rigged a timeline.
Up until a week ago,
the water was clean.

28:33.086 --> 28:36.670
Well, looking at the physical
progressions, I would say
that's an outside limit.

28:36.798 --> 28:40.290
Look, Zane and I are gonna
get back into the genetics.
You guys just hang tight.

28:41.428 --> 28:42.759
We'll fix this.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.970
Look, I understand...

28:47.309 --> 28:49.425
Well, really only a little
of what you guys are saying,

28:49.561 --> 28:51.938
but wouldn't it be easier
to reverse this if we knew
what caused it?

28:52.064 --> 28:53.804
Sure. But how?

28:54.942 --> 28:58.230
All right, I'm still not sure
that backing up on the
sedatives is a good idea.

28:58.362 --> 28:59.852
We have no idea
how strong he is.

28:59.988 --> 29:03.697
Well, we need to talk to him.
If he's still in there.

29:06.036 --> 29:08.243
Hey there, pretty lady.

29:08.789 --> 29:09.778
Ew!

29:09.915 --> 29:11.746
And, apparently, he is.

29:14.127 --> 29:15.207
What happened?

29:15.337 --> 29:17.919
The water system in the lab
is mutating people's DNA.

29:18.048 --> 29:20.790
CARTER: We need to know
who did this to you
so that we can stop it.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.133
Bob, why would you
have been a target?

29:23.262 --> 29:24.968
Everybody likes me.

29:25.222 --> 29:28.464
Look,
why would the water affect
you before everyone else?

29:28.600 --> 29:31.467
l was just watering
my garden and...

29:32.312 --> 29:33.927
(HISSING)
Ew! Oh, my God.

29:34.064 --> 29:35.429
The de-evolution
is accelerating.

29:35.565 --> 29:38.022
I'm not sure how much
longer the human side
is gonna remain dominant.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.812
And when it isn't?

29:39.945 --> 29:41.060
That.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.731
(HISSING)

29:43.240 --> 29:45.697
Okay,
what are we gonna do now?

29:46.493 --> 29:47.903
We go back to
where it started.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.794
Whoa, things were just
starting to die this morning.

29:59.923 --> 30:03.040
Yeah, it's like the whole
garden's been torched.

30:03.176 --> 30:05.258
The water that affected Bob,
can it affect plants?

30:05.387 --> 30:06.422
Sure.

30:06.555 --> 30:07.886
So that's how it
affected everyone else.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.971
It went from Bob
to the plants to the others.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.887
Well, that still doesn't tell
us how it got to the water
in the first place.

30:13.020 --> 30:15.887
Yeah, but this dead area,

30:17.107 --> 30:19.063
it's a perfect circle.

30:19.860 --> 30:22.897
You said that the ionization
levels in the water were off.
Could the sun cause that?

30:23.030 --> 30:25.237
There is no sun. Remember?
The light here is artificial.

30:25.365 --> 30:26.946
The spectrum could've
changed from something

30:27.075 --> 30:30.317
natural to something
containing mutagenic
wavelengths.

30:30.454 --> 30:31.739
So this could've
been intentional.

30:32.873 --> 30:36.206
Like, frying an ant
under a magnifying glass.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.086
Beautiful clouds.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.958
I miss you so much.

30:46.094 --> 30:49.712
Ever since the Sheriff
showed up, it's been
so hard to talk to you.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.464
Well, it's not gonna
get any easier now.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.471
I don't understand.

30:56.063 --> 30:58.019
Now, Derek can explain.

31:01.109 --> 31:02.394
Can't you?

31:03.612 --> 31:05.477
I never meant
to hurt anybody.

31:05.614 --> 31:08.526
Derek and Teri had
a long-distance thing
going on.

31:08.658 --> 31:11.786
No, I heard her talking
to Bob about the clouds.

31:11.912 --> 31:13.868
Yeah, but you didn't
see Bob, did you?

31:13.997 --> 31:16.329
She was talking to me
on the garden phone.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.289
A lot. I checked the log.

31:18.418 --> 31:21.160
I saw the way
Bob looked at Teri.
I didn't want her to get hurt.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.036
ALLISON: But you hurt
everyone else.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.999
I didn't realize that
the sun would affect
the water supply. I just...

31:28.011 --> 31:30.878
I figured if Bob got sick,
he'd have to leave the lab.

31:31.014 --> 31:33.756
And when he got better,
he wouldn't be able
to come back.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.390
You did all that for me?

31:37.270 --> 31:39.010
I love you, Teri.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.640
And we've never even
been able to hold hands.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.976
We had no idea you
were so unhappy.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.061
I wasn't. I'm not.

31:48.198 --> 31:50.814
We would've left.
We would've closed
all of this up for you.

31:50.951 --> 31:52.532
But I didn't want you to.

31:52.661 --> 31:55.528
I didn't want to be
the reason that you lost
the thing you loved.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.446
Oh, honey.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.413
So Rick and Grace were
the red herrings!

32:02.546 --> 32:04.832
I so did not see that coming.

32:04.965 --> 32:07.877
This is the best season yet.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.633
Just coffee.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.932
And that'll be $25.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.477
Better start a tab.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.105
I may want to have
some half and half.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.489
Enjoying the local color?

32:41.126 --> 32:45.711
I am. Observing the nuance
of your fine town. You?

32:45.839 --> 32:48.046
I just came in
to wash my hands.

32:48.175 --> 32:49.836
Is the water still free?

32:50.135 --> 32:51.124
(LAUGHING)

32:52.012 --> 32:54.219
And yours is on the house.

32:55.056 --> 32:58.924
Efficiency has
its own elegance,
Deputy Lupo.

32:59.352 --> 33:02.264
Balancing a town,
a company, a life.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.846
There's a certain
beauty to it.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.850
Well, Iwill be sure
to tell that to the
museum curator

33:07.986 --> 33:10.272
that I just sent packing.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.693
I know today was difficult,
but sometimes you
have to sacrifice a part

33:13.825 --> 33:15.611
for the good of the whole.

33:15.744 --> 33:18.486
So you're saying that
one day we'll thank you.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.245
You might.

33:21.124 --> 33:24.036
I'm not your normal
corporate fixer, you know.

33:24.252 --> 33:27.710
Yeah, and Eureka is
not your normal town.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.955
We've got our own balance.

33:30.467 --> 33:32.048
And you're messing with it.

33:39.059 --> 33:40.674
You look anxious
to get out of here.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.596
This place is
freaking me out.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.391
Looking fonNard to getting
back to some real sunshine,
some fresh air.

33:45.524 --> 33:46.513
Uh-huh.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.562
Yeah. Sorry.
Forget it.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.734
How long till we get a fix
on this mutation thing?

33:51.863 --> 33:54.570
Well, Nathan and I have
targeted all the processes
that need to be reversed,

33:54.699 --> 33:57.862
but it might take us
a few days to figure out
the treatment.

33:57.994 --> 33:59.109
A few days?

33:59.621 --> 34:01.202
That's all it took for Bob
to turn from pain...

34:01.331 --> 34:02.320
(SCREAMING)

34:08.505 --> 34:11.497
He's taken Allison.
We may not even have minutes.

34:16.805 --> 34:19.137
ZOE: What happened?
We lost the feed.

34:24.479 --> 34:27.141
I found Bob's trail.
It's fresh. He doesn't have
much of a head start.

34:27.274 --> 34:29.811
I'll make sure the winds
against you so he can't
pick up your scent.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.899
Good. I'm heading out.
And I'm heading in.

34:32.028 --> 34:33.063
Whoa, whoa.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.857
No, we need you on this end.

34:34.990 --> 34:36.901
We're close on a way
to reverse the gene
de-evolution.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.284
But the delivery
system's killing us.

34:38.410 --> 34:39.570
It's gonna have
to wait till later.

34:39.703 --> 34:42.319
They're changing down there.
You saw Bob.

34:42.455 --> 34:43.911
Look, they hit
a point of no return.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.291
It won't matter if we
get them out or not.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.999
Zane, the only thing that's
going to stop me now is...

34:48.128 --> 34:49.117
CARTER: A gun.

34:50.046 --> 34:51.627
That's a little extreme.

34:51.756 --> 34:54.463
No. Your gun thingy.

34:54.593 --> 34:56.333
The biosensor you
used on Allison and me.

34:56.469 --> 34:58.255
The bioballistic particle
delivery system.

34:58.388 --> 35:00.970
Yes.
We could modify it.
Longer range.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.430
Larger bore, heavier payload.

35:02.559 --> 35:04.971
The time-sink's
gonna be fabrication.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.436
Unless...

35:12.193 --> 35:16.653
Jo, I need a gun.
A big, powerful gun.

35:17.991 --> 35:21.154
I've been waiting
for someone to say that
to me my whole life.

35:22.621 --> 35:23.827
Why would Bob
take Allison?

35:23.955 --> 35:25.411
Well, it depends on which
Bob we're talking about.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.952
If we're talking about
the human Bob, he may think
that she can help him.

35:28.084 --> 35:29.244
No, the other. Snake Bob.

35:29.377 --> 35:32.244
Well, reptiles
aren't exactly complex.
Their needs are basic.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.253
You mean, like food.

35:34.382 --> 35:35.838
Uh-huh.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.173
Fantastic.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.270
(HISSING)

36:00.158 --> 36:01.238
(GASPING)

36:07.791 --> 36:10.282
I thought you could
use a hunting buddy.

36:11.127 --> 36:13.869
What part of hourly reports
does Stark not understand?

36:14.005 --> 36:15.165
He got a little anxious.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.539
The transition facility
is nearly complete.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.837
The tactical team that
he ordered without
authorization

36:19.969 --> 36:21.300
is gonna be ready
in ten minutes.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.545
We're not gonna need it.
How do you know that?

36:24.099 --> 36:26.886
Carter, Henry and Stark,
that's your money team.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.849
They know exactly
what they're doing.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.850
You sure you know
what you're doing?

36:37.946 --> 36:39.652
CARTER: So Ijust
shoot him, right?

36:39.781 --> 36:42.944
Bullet's an organic plastic
covered in plasma DNA.

36:43.076 --> 36:45.613
You hit him, it should
reverse the de-evolution.

36:45.745 --> 36:46.951
Let's do this thing.

36:48.790 --> 36:49.779
(POWERING UP)

36:50.709 --> 36:51.698
(HISSING)

36:53.211 --> 36:55.452
Takes a second to warm up.

36:56.464 --> 36:57.920
You could've
told me.

36:58.049 --> 36:58.959
Guys.

37:01.136 --> 37:03.252
Sorry.
I came as fast as I could.

37:03.388 --> 37:04.423
What's she doing here?

37:04.556 --> 37:06.547
I'm just glad she agreed.

37:08.476 --> 37:12.810
Bob?
It's me, Teri.

37:13.148 --> 37:14.684
Bob likes Teri.

37:14.816 --> 37:18.274
In fact, she's the only woman
down here that he hasn't,
um...

37:18.987 --> 37:21.273
So you're trading
Teri for Allison?

37:22.741 --> 37:23.981
Sort of.

37:25.744 --> 37:26.824
Bob?

37:28.663 --> 37:29.778
Bob!

37:38.882 --> 37:39.871
(GASPS)

37:41.050 --> 37:42.039
(HISSING)

37:42.552 --> 37:43.541
(GRUNTS)

37:51.060 --> 37:52.266
Oh, Nathan.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.101
Thank you.

37:59.861 --> 38:00.850
(PANTING)

38:11.831 --> 38:15.665
Guys, it's Zane.
They saved Allison.
Everybody is fine!

38:15.794 --> 38:17.125
(ALL CHEERING)

38:19.839 --> 38:21.795
I told you he'd be okay.

38:22.675 --> 38:25.257
What do you say we just turn
off the TV and read a book?

38:29.140 --> 38:30.220
Told you they'd pull it off.

38:30.350 --> 38:31.681
Well, don't sell
yourself short.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.892
The redesign on that
gun was inspired.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.226
Well, we all do our part.

38:35.355 --> 38:36.970
I know you do.

38:37.232 --> 38:39.473
Talk to me
about Henry Deacon.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.647
How you feeling?

38:47.992 --> 38:49.778
Okay, I guess.

38:52.121 --> 38:53.907
Getting shot kind of hurt.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.326
If you want to avoid
that in the future,

38:56.459 --> 38:59.417
you might want to be
a little nicer to the ladies.

39:00.046 --> 39:03.083
Point taken, Sheriff.
Learned my lesson.

39:04.133 --> 39:07.341
And if there's any way
I could repay you, I'd...

39:10.265 --> 39:11.471
Once a snake,

39:11.599 --> 39:12.884
always a snake.
Always a snake.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.474
Sheriff Carter. Dr. Deacon.
Yeah?

39:16.020 --> 39:17.726
I just want to say thanks.

39:17.856 --> 39:18.891
Glad we could help.

39:19.023 --> 39:20.604
ls Derek going to jail?

39:20.733 --> 39:22.519
That's not up to me.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.267
I'd like to see him.

39:24.404 --> 39:26.065
Well, that would mean
you'd have to leave the lab.

39:26.197 --> 39:29.655
Well, actually,
we're thinking that's
not such a bad idea.

39:29.784 --> 39:32.025
It's hard enough for
a kid to find their
place in the world.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.903
Especially, when they've
only been to one place.

39:35.039 --> 39:36.779
Excuse us, will you?

39:38.293 --> 39:40.659
CARTER: Henry, there's
something you need to see.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.631
You know, we couldn't
have done it without you.

39:51.764 --> 39:53.345
Well, technically, you did.

39:53.474 --> 39:54.429
(CHUCKLING)

39:55.268 --> 39:57.133
It's not gonna be the same
when you're gone.

39:58.563 --> 39:59.552
(SIGHS)

40:00.064 --> 40:01.725
Not by a long shot.

40:05.320 --> 40:08.153
Thanks. For the sunset.

40:25.506 --> 40:26.632
How you feeling?

40:26.758 --> 40:28.043
Much better.

40:28.509 --> 40:32.969
Thank you for keeping
me from turning into a snake
or being eaten by one.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.303
My pleasure.

40:34.432 --> 40:38.175
You know,
that organic plastic we used
with the delivery system?

40:38.311 --> 40:40.142
It's developed
down in lab 27.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.978
Well, discoveries come from
where we least expect them.

40:43.107 --> 40:46.691
Yeah, well, I'll tell Thorne
that when she wants
to shut the lab down.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.229
I already did.

40:52.617 --> 40:55.825
Hey, I thought your
shift was over hours ago.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.821
Can't a girl bring
her dad a burger after
a hard day's work?

40:58.957 --> 41:00.037
Sure.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.458
I was really
worried about you.

41:06.381 --> 41:07.621
Thanks.

41:14.681 --> 41:15.670
(GULPS)

41:16.391 --> 41:19.474
Okay. I was
worried about you, too.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.222
Why, Josefina, I'm touched.

41:22.355 --> 41:24.095
Don't get used to it.

41:25.191 --> 41:26.180
Good to see Henry.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.023
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

41:28.903 --> 41:32.066
No, it's good to see Henry.

41:32.865 --> 41:35.242
I don't know how to
thank you for my pardon.

41:35.368 --> 41:37.780
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

41:37.912 --> 41:41.825
You're right, it wasn't.
I hope it's worth it.

41:41.958 --> 41:44.825
If you're bringing
Henry back,

41:44.961 --> 41:46.917
the least I can do
is buy you a beer

41:47.046 --> 41:49.162
'cause they now charge
for food around here.

41:49.298 --> 41:53.132
That's all back
the way it belongs as well.
Balance restored.

41:53.261 --> 41:55.798
Besides, single malt's
more my style.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.841
Your secret's safe with me.

41:57.974 --> 42:00.260
Good to know.
Good night, gentlemen.

42:00.810 --> 42:02.175
Good night.

42:08.985 --> 42:10.475
(BOTH LAUGHING)

42:11.029 --> 42:13.441
Listen, I'm not even sure
I should've come back.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.230
Of course you should.

42:17.452 --> 42:18.942
You're home.

42:25.001 --> 42:26.582
Hello.
How are you?

42:26.711 --> 42:28.121
Good.
Okay.

42:33.718 --> 42:36.380
Hey, Vince, good to see you.
I'll get to you.
