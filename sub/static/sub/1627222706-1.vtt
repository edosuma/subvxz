WEBVTT

00:16.344 --> 00:19.620
We have a
liftoff, liftoff on Apollo 11.

01:11.551 --> 01:14.411
The sun
scorches through the day,

01:14.413 --> 01:18.204
but at night this place
will be terribly cold

01:18.206 --> 01:22.206
and dark, with only
the hint of starlight.

01:23.068 --> 01:27.241
A shining system of lights
will soon follow though,

01:27.862 --> 01:33.342
as we cross, cross over
from death to paradise,

01:33.344 --> 01:35.896
a paradise of mankind.

01:37.551 --> 01:39.758
The seat of kings,

01:39.931 --> 01:43.172
and the very Earth
their paupers will till.

01:45.413 --> 01:47.896
This is Hollywood.

01:49.689 --> 01:53.378
Hollywood is where movies
come from, my dears.

01:54.413 --> 01:56.689
That is its reason for being.

01:57.172 --> 02:00.241
That's what gave it
life, breathed into it.

02:00.551 --> 02:02.756
And like God with Adam,

02:02.758 --> 02:07.448
something was created from
only dirt, dust, and water.

02:12.448 --> 02:15.413
But what is today's
Hollywood really like?

02:17.931 --> 02:20.241
Indeed, we shall
seek the answer.

02:33.137 --> 02:34.241
Hollywood.

02:34.724 --> 02:35.965
What is it now?

02:38.103 --> 02:39.653
What about those
with their finger,

02:39.655 --> 02:43.239
no, not their finger,
but their entire bodies

02:43.241 --> 02:46.103
moving to the funk of
the real Hollywood?

02:59.655 --> 03:02.310
Do you know what Hollywood is?

03:03.379 --> 03:04.793
Hello, I'm speaking to you.

03:05.034 --> 03:06.377
What the hell
are you doing here?

03:06.379 --> 03:07.342
Do you know what-

03:07.344 --> 03:08.618
- Hollywood?

03:08.620 --> 03:09.620
Yes.

03:10.965 --> 03:11.896
You want to see Hollywood?

03:11.965 --> 03:13.793
Yes, we'd really like to know.

03:24.965 --> 03:25.827
Hollywood's Mondo.

03:25.965 --> 03:26.965
Mondo?

03:27.482 --> 03:29.000
What's Mondo?

03:35.482 --> 03:37.342
Sir, excuse me.

03:37.344 --> 03:38.860
What's Mondo?

03:38.862 --> 03:40.653
You gotta go see
the man who knows.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.032
Pardon, who?

03:48.034 --> 03:49.448
The man who knows.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.135
We must find him now.

03:51.137 --> 03:55.000
This strange, inebriated
fellow must tell us how.

03:59.655 --> 04:02.551
Sir, where do we find
the man who knows?

04:02.586 --> 04:03.929
What is the address?

04:03.931 --> 04:06.724
3125 Birkdale Court.

04:14.931 --> 04:16.894
What is this Mondo?

04:16.896 --> 04:18.272
Can we make sense of it,

04:18.274 --> 04:21.962
or does it in fact defy
such banalities as sense?

04:21.964 --> 04:27.758
And just who is this man who
knows, this Norman Boyle?

04:52.724 --> 04:55.413
And yes hello, excuse me.

04:58.448 --> 05:00.137
What's the meaning of this?

05:14.931 --> 05:16.929
We're here to see Norman Boyle.

05:16.931 --> 05:18.000
I like you man.

05:21.344 --> 05:23.758
No one calls him
Norman, all right.

05:23.827 --> 05:25.310
His name's Boyle.

05:26.275 --> 05:27.586
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:28.344 --> 05:29.482
- Boyle?
- Yeah.

05:30.275 --> 05:31.931
It would be rude
to call him Norman.

05:36.344 --> 05:37.515
Are you groovy, man?

05:37.517 --> 05:38.687
I think so.

05:38.689 --> 05:41.068
Come on you guys,
let's help him out.

05:41.931 --> 05:44.137
He's cool man, he's fine.

05:44.172 --> 05:45.172
All right.

05:46.103 --> 05:47.103
Buzz man?

06:13.068 --> 06:14.894
I must speak to this man.

06:14.896 --> 06:17.342
I seek valuable
information he possesses.

06:17.344 --> 06:20.241
Guys, I'm gonna show
him where Norman is.

06:20.344 --> 06:21.344
All right.

06:26.862 --> 06:31.862
Get some cake. Get
some cake. Get some cake.

06:45.517 --> 06:47.827
Excuse me sir, may I?

06:47.896 --> 06:49.034
Boyle's in there man.

06:52.551 --> 06:53.862
Oh my word.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.482
Always pay your bills man.

07:03.103 --> 07:06.413
Hello, I come
here from the fifth dimension.

07:07.137 --> 07:09.068
Can you help me in my quest?

07:10.482 --> 07:13.135
Yeah, I don't know.

07:13.137 --> 07:15.413
It depends on what it is.

07:15.620 --> 07:17.793
I was told Hollywood is Mondo,

07:17.965 --> 07:20.241
but what is Mondo?

07:20.310 --> 07:22.413
They say, you know
what it means.

07:23.137 --> 07:26.068
Mondo, yeah yeah.

07:26.241 --> 07:27.241
Huh?

07:29.310 --> 07:30.620
That's heavy, man.

07:33.310 --> 07:35.101
Have you ever lost someone?

07:35.103 --> 07:38.931
Losing a loved
one is, well, so not groovy.

07:40.413 --> 07:41.551
You get it, then.

07:43.551 --> 07:45.275
I lost my cat, Zappo.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.653
I was devastated.

07:51.655 --> 07:54.653
And then through my readings
and other things, you know,

07:54.655 --> 07:56.101
you realize that
the bedrock nature

07:56.103 --> 07:57.275
of the universe is horror.

07:58.241 --> 08:02.032
However, there are forces
that guide us, you know

08:02.034 --> 08:04.204
like some grand puppeteer
and we're marionettes

08:04.206 --> 08:05.998
and our fingers
are puppet strings.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
They, I don't know, man.

08:09.862 --> 08:11.448
Mondo is hard to explain.

08:12.482 --> 08:13.689
I built this chair.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.000
I had this vision.

08:50.034 --> 08:52.825
I don't know man, ever
since I lost Zappo

08:52.827 --> 08:54.965
I started dedicating
myself to my work.

08:56.137 --> 08:57.337
Let me take you to the mirror.

08:57.965 --> 08:58.998
It'll make more sense.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.551
In my vision, I saw the Titans,

09:06.931 --> 09:08.172
the Weirdos,

09:10.103 --> 09:12.206
and the Dreamers.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.687
And I started growing magic
mushrooms for all three.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.931
Grow 'em, process 'em.

09:19.620 --> 09:21.549
I add a secret step, which
I can't tell you about,

09:21.551 --> 09:25.758
and then I turn the
horror into beauty.

09:26.551 --> 09:30.206
See? Titans, Weirdos, Dreamers.

09:31.379 --> 09:34.239
I can't explain
exactly what Mondo is,

09:34.241 --> 09:40.517
but I bet if you went and saw
Titans, Weirdos, the Dreamers,

09:40.758 --> 09:42.241
you'd find Mondo.

09:47.275 --> 09:49.068
I'm sorry about your cat.

11:35.275 --> 11:38.758
Boyle, we got an
agreement, okay?

11:39.620 --> 11:41.170
I give you low rent,

11:41.172 --> 11:43.756
and you're supposed to
take care of my property.

11:43.758 --> 11:45.618
But ever since
Zappo's been gone.

11:45.620 --> 11:48.101
You've got a major rat problem.

11:48.103 --> 11:51.310
I can replace you, easy.

11:52.137 --> 11:54.448
One craigslist, just like that.

11:58.344 --> 12:00.172
Sorry about your Zappo.

12:03.862 --> 12:07.551
Call the exterminator right now.

12:12.724 --> 12:13.724
Rat trap.

12:14.241 --> 12:15.241
Tape.

12:18.862 --> 12:21.551
I'm gonna gas these rats.

12:30.689 --> 12:33.655
The Titans,
the first on our list.

12:33.862 --> 12:35.894
Like the proto-gods of yore,

12:35.896 --> 12:39.689
the Titans are imposing,
if not everlasting.

12:48.344 --> 12:50.551
No fuck ups, and
things delivered.

12:51.068 --> 12:53.342
That's my job as Chief
Operating Officer

12:53.344 --> 12:54.482
of Paveway Pictures.

12:56.482 --> 12:57.411
We've got it.

12:57.413 --> 12:59.862
We did Academy
Award-nominated films,

13:02.793 --> 13:05.275
tasteful arts,
selected at Cannes.

13:08.586 --> 13:09.793
You name it, we've got it.

13:12.620 --> 13:15.448
Right now, I've got this sci-fi
picture, "Speed of Light,".

13:15.620 --> 13:17.275
"Twilight" in space.

13:20.655 --> 13:23.103
But the Disney star's
got in some problems.

13:24.965 --> 13:26.379
It's my job to fix it.

13:31.965 --> 13:33.275
Hi Tom.

13:51.620 --> 13:53.448
Let's get this over with.

13:56.551 --> 13:58.308
Cavity resonance.

13:58.310 --> 13:59.310
Wait wait,

13:59.482 --> 14:00.653
I'm supposed to be an alien.

14:00.655 --> 14:01.862
Should I do a voice?

14:01.965 --> 14:03.034
No.

14:03.344 --> 14:04.655
Focus okay?

14:06.206 --> 14:07.655
Cavity resonance.

14:08.344 --> 14:09.034
What?

14:09.310 --> 14:11.204
Another way to measure
the speed of light

14:11.206 --> 14:12.791
is to independently measure

14:12.793 --> 14:14.860
the frequency and the wavelength

14:14.862 --> 14:16.549
of the electromagnetic field.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.689
Wow, you know your stuff.

14:19.344 --> 14:21.482
I'm so happy to have met you.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.172
You're the most important
thing in my life.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.206
What the fuck was that?

14:28.379 --> 14:30.549
Science and feelings
don't go together.

14:30.551 --> 14:32.653
I mean, I want to do
stuff with meaning.

14:32.655 --> 14:35.032
I want to do like plays.

14:35.034 --> 14:37.135
Oh my God, you'd
be great in a play.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.170
I'd be good in a play.

14:38.172 --> 14:39.377
You'd be so good in a play.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.135
I saw a play on the West
End when I was in the UK.

14:42.137 --> 14:43.000
So much ketamine.

14:43.137 --> 14:43.860
So much.

14:43.862 --> 14:45.515
I wish I had some.

14:45.517 --> 14:46.860
Yeah, I was like
seven years old,

14:46.862 --> 14:49.032
and I was like, woah,
this is intense.

14:49.034 --> 14:50.034
Seven?

14:50.310 --> 14:52.470
Can you just do me a biggie
and cut up that watermelon?

14:53.689 --> 14:55.862
But we just got here,
there aren't any knives.

15:00.517 --> 15:01.929
Illegal
aliens are the hot topic.

15:01.931 --> 15:05.101
No, not illegal aliens, Dick,

15:05.103 --> 15:07.273
I know what a fucking
illegal alien is.

15:07.275 --> 15:08.411
Gaga, Trump.

15:08.413 --> 15:11.377
Yeah, I'd rather be doing
an illegal alien movie.

15:11.379 --> 15:12.896
Fucking put me in a truck.

15:13.034 --> 15:14.101
I believe in you.

15:14.103 --> 15:15.860
That's why I represent you.

15:15.862 --> 15:17.344
You're a loser.

15:59.551 --> 16:00.551
Did Dick call?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
No.

16:04.655 --> 16:06.827
Oh wait, Yeah yeah.

16:08.620 --> 16:09.655
Can you set up a meeting?

16:13.310 --> 16:14.103
Hey man.

16:14.172 --> 16:15.172
What up?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.137
I tried that, she won't budge.

16:24.206 --> 16:26.620
She insists her character
wouldn't say those kind of things.

16:26.689 --> 16:29.344
Listen, this director
is not gonna take notes

16:29.517 --> 16:32.172
from a fucking
17-year-old Disney actor.

16:32.344 --> 16:33.791
Look, you can talk
to her, all right?

16:33.793 --> 16:35.101
I'll have Sam coordinate
a time to meet.

16:35.103 --> 16:35.793
Fine.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.618
Just email Grace
with some dates.

16:37.620 --> 16:39.653
Look, you know,
you guys are Latinx.

16:40.482 --> 16:41.273
Yeah, sure.

16:41.275 --> 16:42.275
All right, you got this.

16:44.965 --> 16:45.965
Oh fuck.

16:46.137 --> 16:47.137
Just a question,

16:47.206 --> 16:48.860
what are the chances that
we can recast Poloma?

16:48.862 --> 16:50.825
I don't need an explanation,
just a yes or no.

16:50.827 --> 16:51.655
No.

16:51.827 --> 16:52.963
Why, what happened?

16:52.965 --> 16:54.929
Am I gonna see her tomorrow
on TMZ with white powder

16:54.931 --> 16:55.931
all over her nose,

16:56.068 --> 16:57.480
crawling out of a club
with a broken heel or what?

16:57.482 --> 16:58.842
No, no, no, no.
There's no problem.

16:59.758 --> 17:02.482
What if I were your manager?

17:08.550 --> 17:10.515
Shut your dirty
little gay mouth.

17:10.517 --> 17:12.378
You shut your
little Latina face.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.896
Let's do coconut
and talk about it.

17:18.655 --> 17:19.584
You know, I need to be doing

17:19.586 --> 17:21.721
what Natalie Portman does, okay?

17:21.723 --> 17:23.342
Not like Peyton List does.

17:23.344 --> 17:24.550
I want perfume ads.

17:24.758 --> 17:26.032
I feel like someone
was after me,

17:26.034 --> 17:28.342
like if TMZ was like after me,

17:28.344 --> 17:30.204
like you would be
there to cover my ass.

17:30.206 --> 17:31.998
I wouldn't be like Britney
with the shaved head,

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
you'd get me away.

17:34.034 --> 17:35.413
How do I get on SNL?

17:36.034 --> 17:38.549
Well, that's the question
that I'm here to answer,

17:38.551 --> 17:39.896
if I were your manager.

17:40.034 --> 17:42.929
I'll do to the Disneyland castle

17:42.931 --> 17:45.896
what Mohamed Atta did
tower number one and two.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.204
Oh my God, you wanna go outside?

17:49.206 --> 17:50.206
Yeah.

17:50.344 --> 17:51.515
Terrible idea.

17:51.517 --> 17:52.549
Let's go in.

17:54.068 --> 17:55.549
I mean Tupac just left LA.

17:55.551 --> 17:56.998
He's alive, he's alive.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.170
Tupac is still alive,

17:59.172 --> 18:01.965
and he's like sad when
people pretend he's dead.

18:12.620 --> 18:13.620
Gross.

18:18.482 --> 18:19.584
We got to go get blow, man,

18:19.586 --> 18:20.931
This is ridiculous.

18:21.724 --> 18:22.549
Come on man.

18:22.551 --> 18:23.551
Whoa man.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.446
You got to get
another hand soap, man.

18:25.448 --> 18:27.653
You can't use fucking
bar soap for hand soap.

18:27.655 --> 18:29.375
You know how much
bacteria is on that stuff?

18:29.413 --> 18:30.411
What's wrong with my hand soap?

18:30.413 --> 18:31.101
It's shitty.

18:31.103 --> 18:32.965
You use your hands.

18:33.241 --> 18:34.355
You wash your hands all day,

18:34.379 --> 18:35.653
and then you know,
you get shitty soap. It's just-

18:35.655 --> 18:37.255
- Smells like an Irish
spring, I like it.

18:37.724 --> 18:38.724
Get your beer.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.791
Hey, so what's going
on with this blow?

18:40.793 --> 18:42.482
We going soon, or
what's the deal?

18:42.931 --> 18:44.971
I can't go tonight, man,
I've got to deal with this.

18:45.241 --> 18:46.241
What?

18:46.310 --> 18:47.239
I can't go tonight.

18:47.241 --> 18:48.308
What do you mean you can't
go tonight?

18:48.310 --> 18:49.310
We are going tonight.

18:49.448 --> 18:51.549
That's what we decided on,
we're gonna go tonight.

18:51.551 --> 18:52.894
I can't go anymore.

18:52.896 --> 18:54.241
I gotta deal with this.

18:55.448 --> 18:56.793
You gotta, this was our plan.

18:57.068 --> 18:59.066
You know, you understand
my time is valuable.

18:59.068 --> 19:00.446
You think it was
my plan for a bunch

19:00.448 --> 19:02.172
of rats to show up
in my goddamn attic?

19:04.655 --> 19:05.825
Dude, we'll go on Friday.

19:05.827 --> 19:06.377
Friday?

19:06.379 --> 19:07.379
Let's remember that.

19:09.034 --> 19:10.034
Friday.

19:11.206 --> 19:12.246
- Put in my...
- want some?

19:12.896 --> 19:15.034
No, I'm coming down
now, hold the ladder.

19:15.172 --> 19:16.527
Ain't nothing wrong
with a little jake.

19:16.551 --> 19:18.965
Tell me more about this
soap you use for bumps?

19:20.862 --> 19:23.000
For the hand soap, I use,

19:23.344 --> 19:24.825
which is, it's very
good French soap.

19:24.827 --> 19:26.515
It smells nice, great
packaging, it's all that.

19:26.517 --> 19:27.549
And it's something
that's always there.

19:27.551 --> 19:28.838
You don't have to
use it all the time.

19:28.862 --> 19:31.308
But for the body you can
actually use a good bar of soap.

19:31.310 --> 19:32.034
And I have this one.

19:32.206 --> 19:34.135
It's got this
charcoal magnesium,

19:34.137 --> 19:36.172
which doesn't allow
it to get all...

19:36.310 --> 19:38.000
- Hold the ladder.
- Slimy, you know.

19:39.000 --> 19:39.963
You take all the batteries

19:39.965 --> 19:41.010
out of all the
alarms in the house.

19:41.034 --> 19:42.653
This is how human
beings kill themselves.

19:42.655 --> 19:44.687
You don't think I can
kill a few rodents?

19:44.689 --> 19:45.998
Precision, precision,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.135
things get accomplished
with precision.

19:48.137 --> 19:49.172
Tug on that.

19:51.310 --> 19:52.135
Pretty good, right?

19:52.137 --> 19:53.206
Not bad.

19:53.482 --> 19:55.242
We still should get a
hose on the other side.

19:56.793 --> 19:57.793
You ready?

19:58.517 --> 19:59.517
What's going on here?

20:02.137 --> 20:03.310
What's going on here?

20:03.862 --> 20:05.687
Just some maintenance man,
just working on the house.

20:05.689 --> 20:07.009
No no no no,
what's going on here?

20:07.517 --> 20:08.515
Just some house
maintenance, man.

20:08.517 --> 20:09.515
Maintenance?

20:09.517 --> 20:12.032
A hose is coming
out of your car?

20:12.034 --> 20:13.182
Hey, we're just
having a beer, man.

20:13.206 --> 20:14.803
I don't know who you are.
Please don't speak to me.

20:14.827 --> 20:15.827
It's just a hoax.

20:15.896 --> 20:17.482
This is insanity,
I live right there.

20:17.551 --> 20:18.655
I feel very uncomfortable,

20:18.827 --> 20:20.549
It is this very nefarious,

20:20.551 --> 20:21.825
and definitely illegal,
definitely illegal.

20:21.827 --> 20:22.791
Definitely illegal?

20:22.793 --> 20:23.860
Dude, I'm a law abiding citizen.

20:23.862 --> 20:25.998
I've never done anything
illegal in my entire life.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.308
I know what goes
on in here, okay?

20:27.310 --> 20:28.894
I know all those weird
little things you do.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.515
It's all very inappropriate,
and very strange strange.

20:30.517 --> 20:32.320
Things, what are you talking
about, things that go on?

20:32.344 --> 20:33.170
What laws of am I breaking?

20:33.172 --> 20:33.998
I got proof.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.344
- Proof?
- Yeah.

20:37.172 --> 20:38.172
What are you doing?

20:45.034 --> 20:46.655
Just remember that.

20:47.689 --> 20:48.689
Friday.

20:49.689 --> 20:51.034
- Put it in my...
- want some?

20:51.517 --> 20:53.860
No,
I'm coming down now, hold the ladder.

20:53.862 --> 20:54.963
Ain't nothing wrong
with a little Jake.

20:54.965 --> 20:56.000
That's illegal, man.

20:57.379 --> 20:57.860
That's illegal.

20:57.862 --> 20:58.618
You can't tape.

20:58.620 --> 20:59.620
It's not illegal.

20:59.655 --> 21:00.929
It's not cocaine, I
was smelling my hands.

21:00.931 --> 21:02.034
That's ridiculous.

21:02.103 --> 21:03.377
What an insane excuse.

21:03.379 --> 21:04.894
He was smelling his
hands, I got bad soap.

21:04.896 --> 21:05.976
If I see any of this again,

21:06.137 --> 21:08.446
if I see any of this, this
car and this gas or this man,

21:08.448 --> 21:10.929
I will call the police and
that's final, that's it.

21:10.931 --> 21:11.931
Police?

21:12.103 --> 21:13.239
That's it, no, no, no,

21:13.241 --> 21:15.101
this is over, the
conversation's over, it's done.

21:15.103 --> 21:16.103
It's done.

21:17.241 --> 21:18.586
Okay, thank you, bye.

21:20.586 --> 21:21.586
Jesus.

21:22.379 --> 21:23.517
Fuck man, what do I do?

21:24.241 --> 21:25.241
Just don't do it now.

21:25.379 --> 21:28.413
Wait, you think he'll do
something with that video?

21:29.103 --> 21:30.103
I don't know, man.

21:30.689 --> 21:31.448
I don't trust him,

21:31.620 --> 21:33.241
I think he's a
fascist and a pervert.

21:57.862 --> 21:58.862
Dres?

22:05.000 --> 22:07.620
You need to tell me that
this is all worth it.

22:09.931 --> 22:10.931
It is.

22:27.275 --> 22:29.655
We oppose as
a continual threat to peace.

22:32.482 --> 22:34.515
These are the contrasting
points of view

22:34.517 --> 22:35.998
between the major antagonist.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.273
As a creature, not a God,

22:38.275 --> 22:39.586
but of the state.

22:40.172 --> 22:42.241
The state will run
his life for him.

22:42.586 --> 22:43.931
His political life,

22:44.172 --> 22:45.655
his business life,

22:47.103 --> 22:48.275
his social life.

22:49.620 --> 22:51.342
I don't know man, this
pervert across the street's

22:51.344 --> 22:52.687
got me all fucking paranoid.

22:52.689 --> 22:54.515
I'm not feeling good, I
don't like any of this.

22:54.517 --> 22:55.687
I feel like the
cops are after me.

22:55.689 --> 22:56.791
I feel like the
government's after me.

22:56.793 --> 22:57.963
I feel like everyone's after me.

22:57.965 --> 22:58.998
I feel like people watch me.

22:59.000 --> 22:59.998
I feel like Derek's after me.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.066
I feel like everything
is not going my way,

23:02.068 --> 23:03.344
it's not very Mondo.

23:03.551 --> 23:05.068
I do not like it,
It's not groovy.

23:05.379 --> 23:08.172
This whole situation
is making me feel like

23:09.172 --> 23:10.653
the rats are not
only in the attic,

23:10.655 --> 23:11.998
they're in my head, you know.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.687
They're in my brain,
they're in my eyes,

23:13.689 --> 23:14.860
they're in my fingertips,

23:14.862 --> 23:17.241
and I feel like I'm gonna
lose my fucking mind.

23:17.586 --> 23:18.549
From this belief

23:18.551 --> 23:21.586
in man as a responsible being,

23:21.758 --> 23:24.066
all the beliefs and his
other qualifications

23:24.068 --> 23:25.379
which we accept,

23:25.413 --> 23:28.344
usually even without
bothering to think about them,

23:28.413 --> 23:30.584
as parts of that
vague condition,

23:30.586 --> 23:33.379
which we call the American way.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.860
His ability, indeed his right

23:36.862 --> 23:39.137
to explore the
truth in all things.

23:40.206 --> 23:42.000
His ability to govern himself.

23:57.724 --> 23:59.137
I am for peace.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.206
When I speak,

24:01.551 --> 24:02.931
they are for war.

24:06.068 --> 24:07.206
Lock 'em and load 'em.

24:18.448 --> 24:21.275
Ever since you told
me you got a facial,

24:21.620 --> 24:24.135
all I can see in my
nose are these pores.

24:24.137 --> 24:25.446
Yeah, you can see 'em, right?

24:25.448 --> 24:26.239
You gotta get rid of that shit.

24:26.241 --> 24:27.066
It's under here.

24:27.068 --> 24:28.273
Yeah.

24:28.275 --> 24:29.101
Think about it.

24:29.103 --> 24:30.135
That's the only thing I see.

24:30.137 --> 24:31.257
You gotta have that cleaned.

24:32.793 --> 24:34.137
This blow better be good, man.

24:34.275 --> 24:37.413
Your fate, destination,
is on your right.

24:39.758 --> 24:40.758
Man.

24:42.413 --> 24:43.448
The man from heaven.

24:44.965 --> 24:46.758
I would recommend something on.

24:48.137 --> 24:49.965
30 rounds, full automatic.

24:50.310 --> 24:53.308
M-16 style, for a little
bit more distance,

24:53.310 --> 24:54.310
a little more accurate.

24:55.413 --> 24:58.722
I would definitely highly
recommend a Mossberg shotgun.

24:58.724 --> 25:00.860
Maybe something small like this,

25:00.862 --> 25:02.310
you put it in the back pocket.

25:02.655 --> 25:04.687
What do we
got going on over here?

25:04.689 --> 25:06.275
These are special.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.448
The best defense against tyranny
is a well-armed populace.

25:15.310 --> 25:16.377
See where this guy is looking

25:16.379 --> 25:17.342
at the business end of the gun,

25:17.344 --> 25:18.624
that's the wrong end of the gun.

25:19.034 --> 25:20.424
You don't want to put
that next to your face.

25:20.448 --> 25:21.448
Isn't that right?

25:21.689 --> 25:22.862
That's right.

25:37.827 --> 25:39.172
Beautiful day.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.620
Beautiful day.

25:42.137 --> 25:43.310
About time, sunshine.

25:49.965 --> 25:50.998
Whoa whoa whoa.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Shh.

26:03.689 --> 26:04.689
Beef stick?

26:18.068 --> 26:19.068
Hey wait.

26:21.586 --> 26:23.000
Take this instead.

26:23.586 --> 26:24.413
What the fuck is this?

26:24.551 --> 26:25.586
Just try it out.

26:25.724 --> 26:26.586
Do I snort this?

26:26.620 --> 26:30.172
No, put it in wine
or water or tea.

26:30.862 --> 26:31.862
I can snort this.

26:33.034 --> 26:34.377
Yeah, snort it.

26:34.379 --> 26:35.584
Actually yeah, snort it.

26:35.586 --> 26:36.689
I can snort this.

26:38.689 --> 26:39.862
It's just one line.

26:40.275 --> 26:42.517
One line.

26:44.275 --> 26:46.068
I-I-I-don't-

26:48.103 --> 26:49.383
I don't know what you're saying.

26:49.448 --> 26:52.000
I don't speak Polish.

26:55.275 --> 26:56.275
Hey Ted.

26:57.931 --> 27:02.586
Yesterday, you left
your bag of coke here.

27:03.275 --> 27:05.068
It's not coke, it's sugar.

27:05.482 --> 27:06.655
I'm hypoglycemic.

27:07.620 --> 27:08.620
Where is it?

27:13.620 --> 27:15.101
I don't care where it is.

27:15.103 --> 27:16.135
Just pick a place.

27:16.137 --> 27:16.827
Of course, of course.

27:17.103 --> 27:18.515
Alright, look.
I'll pick a time and date.

27:18.517 --> 27:19.618
And when you get the table,

27:19.620 --> 27:21.137
just make sure it's for three.

27:21.655 --> 27:22.827
Dres is my new manager.

27:30.275 --> 27:31.275
Wednesday.

27:33.344 --> 27:34.758
You want me to paint?

27:37.172 --> 27:38.827
Well I can't paint.

27:38.931 --> 27:40.655
I can't paint any more.

27:40.965 --> 27:43.931
But you, you are,

27:44.793 --> 27:46.931
the blind painter.

28:11.896 --> 28:12.896
Hi.

28:14.724 --> 28:16.458
I thought you said your
manager was gonna be here?

28:16.482 --> 28:17.482
The new guy.

28:17.551 --> 28:20.172
It's just us, so did
you talk to the director?

28:24.689 --> 28:25.896
Don't do the Spanish thing.

28:26.000 --> 28:26.655
Okay?

28:26.689 --> 28:27.722
Yeah, you're right.

28:27.724 --> 28:28.756
I don't know why did that shit.

28:28.758 --> 28:29.894
Listen, the
director's an asshole

28:29.896 --> 28:30.976
and won't budge, all right?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.931
The more I push it, the
more she wants to recast.

28:33.103 --> 28:35.101
The more I defend you, the more
she thinks I'm against her.

28:35.103 --> 28:37.377
So I'm in a tight spot here,
I need you to help me out.

28:37.379 --> 28:39.068
Let's figure this
thing out, please.

28:39.241 --> 28:40.722
You're in a tight spot?

28:40.724 --> 28:42.241
It's me that's on screen.

28:42.379 --> 28:44.687
My likelihood, my face.

28:44.689 --> 28:46.862
Yeah, but we need you
in Atlanta in three days.

28:47.344 --> 28:50.342
I'm not gonna be in Atlanta
in three fucking days.

28:50.344 --> 28:52.170
You sign a contract,
you read the script.

28:52.172 --> 28:53.515
You say yes, you show up,

28:53.517 --> 28:54.687
you flash that
pretty smile yours,

28:54.689 --> 28:55.689
and we all move along.

28:55.827 --> 28:57.034
You make a paycheck and go.

28:58.172 --> 28:59.586
Flash that pretty smile?

28:59.689 --> 29:02.275
This is my fucking life, okay?

29:02.482 --> 29:04.929
I'm not just gonna
walk onto set and go,

29:04.931 --> 29:06.896
hey, let's make a
movie about aliens.

29:06.931 --> 29:09.310
I fucking hate aliens.

29:09.413 --> 29:11.791
So I need to, I need to regroup.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.618
I need you to change the lines.

29:13.620 --> 29:15.308
Okay, cause that's your job.

29:15.310 --> 29:16.825
And I don't see why
that's so fucking bad.

29:16.827 --> 29:18.347
I am doing my job,
that's why I'm here.

29:18.482 --> 29:22.034
I need you to do your job
and show up and deliver.

29:22.620 --> 29:23.482
Okay?

29:23.620 --> 29:24.653
You're making a lot
of money for this.

29:24.655 --> 29:27.310
I have one million
followers on Instagram.

29:27.586 --> 29:29.618
I get thousands of dollars

29:29.620 --> 29:33.135
for posting a picture of me
fucking brushing my teeth.

29:33.137 --> 29:34.655
What the fuck are
you talking about?

29:34.827 --> 29:36.239
Do you make money for literally

29:36.241 --> 29:38.551
just pretending to
drink a smart water?

29:39.137 --> 29:42.653
Do you make money for
walking a Yorkie named Paul,

29:42.655 --> 29:44.482
who has an Instagram following?

29:44.586 --> 29:46.584
Do you make money for
stepping outside your door

29:46.586 --> 29:48.411
and taking a photo in
front of a palm tree,

29:48.413 --> 29:49.756
wearing a shirt
that says Nevada?

29:49.758 --> 29:51.756
Do you make money for
sitting outside your pool,

29:51.758 --> 29:53.273
sleeping all day?

29:53.275 --> 29:56.101
I have a photographer come
to take pictures of me

29:56.103 --> 29:57.480
- sleeping.
- Okay, that's enough.

29:57.482 --> 29:59.308
I don't think you're
understanding this.

29:59.310 --> 30:01.965
It's like I shit money.

30:02.137 --> 30:04.549
I can just pay
off this contract,

30:04.551 --> 30:05.655
I don't have to do it.

30:05.758 --> 30:07.825
My manager and I read
the script more closely

30:07.827 --> 30:10.135
and we think the lines
are fucking shitty.

30:10.137 --> 30:11.618
A two-year-old
could've written them.

30:11.620 --> 30:14.103
So let's change them, I don't
see what the problem is.

30:18.275 --> 30:19.275
I think we're done here.

30:22.758 --> 30:25.549
One, a few days,
you can't just, no.

30:25.551 --> 30:26.551
- No.
- Okay.

30:26.724 --> 30:27.724
No.

30:28.413 --> 30:31.446
My manager will email you
the rest of my requests,

30:31.448 --> 30:33.448
'cause I might add some
fucking more, okay?

30:33.655 --> 30:36.275
Oh great, please,
just pile on your list.

30:36.413 --> 30:37.310
Yeah, all right.

30:37.413 --> 30:38.620
It was nice to see you, okay?

30:40.931 --> 30:41.965
Oh, and by the way?

30:43.103 --> 30:43.586
Yeah.

30:44.034 --> 30:45.448
You have some
cocaine on your nose.

30:45.620 --> 30:47.068
It's sunscreen.

31:10.793 --> 31:11.862
Baby rats from the attic.

31:22.655 --> 31:23.860
Bourne Idenity soundtrack.

31:23.862 --> 31:24.862
Great to drive to.

31:48.655 --> 31:50.618
You know what,
tell the director,

31:50.620 --> 31:51.793
and just fuck 'em.

31:53.172 --> 31:55.000
Paloma's the fuckin' money!

32:19.586 --> 32:20.586
It's Ted.

32:21.275 --> 32:23.758
Scene 42, the line's changing.

32:24.068 --> 32:25.068
Make it happen.

32:25.275 --> 32:27.172
No questions. Bye.

32:32.275 --> 32:33.929
Let's go get some
cocktails, baby.

32:33.931 --> 32:35.101
Yeah, let's cruise man.

32:35.103 --> 32:36.103
Yeah!

32:39.620 --> 32:41.584
What is there like
even in Arkansas anyway?

32:41.586 --> 32:43.620
I think it will be fun, Dres.

32:43.724 --> 32:46.241
I know a UPM there
who has a hookup.

32:46.724 --> 32:48.034
We'll survive.

32:48.275 --> 32:49.275
Hello?

32:49.931 --> 32:51.377
That's not gonna work for me.

32:51.379 --> 32:52.618
I actually noticed that Miles

32:52.620 --> 32:54.896
had three times the
per diem that I do,

32:55.551 --> 32:59.000
and I'm higher on the call
sheet, so do the math.

33:00.068 --> 33:01.172
All right.

33:01.275 --> 33:02.344
Mm-hmm.

33:02.517 --> 33:04.310
Have a wonderful day.

33:10.275 --> 33:11.791
People these days.

33:11.793 --> 33:13.103
They fucking suck.

33:26.275 --> 33:27.275
Fucking awesome.

34:57.896 --> 34:58.896
In the night,

34:59.344 --> 35:02.273
the playground of the
Titans crosses over

35:02.275 --> 35:05.275
into the dominion
of the Weirdos.

35:15.448 --> 35:16.482
It's a discussion.

35:16.758 --> 35:19.310
We're all talking ideologies
at this get together,

35:19.620 --> 35:22.275
libertarians,
communists, capitalists,

35:22.758 --> 35:24.448
democrats, and conservatives.

35:27.620 --> 35:30.101
And you have
to be in awe of the Weirdos,

35:30.103 --> 35:32.965
the heartbeat of
all things Mondo,

35:33.103 --> 35:36.793
means one must be prepared
for counter-perspectives.

35:47.655 --> 35:50.413
That is how the
counterculture exists.

35:50.655 --> 35:53.584
And if it is to
thrive in Hollywood,

35:53.586 --> 35:57.448
then it must take all
shapes, all sizes.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.862
Boogaloo gate opening.

36:14.137 --> 36:15.689
Welcome to my Boogaloo.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I'm an astrological priestess.

36:22.310 --> 36:24.308
My goal is to
create environments

36:24.310 --> 36:28.310
that spark love, energy,
and healthy debate.

36:31.482 --> 36:32.482
Hey, I'm Caesar.

36:32.620 --> 36:34.689
I met Naya at Diamond 7.

36:35.034 --> 36:37.137
Her discussion's
gonna be amazing.

36:37.310 --> 36:39.689
And as for myself, I
make giant spheres.

36:41.551 --> 36:44.000
I like to find stuff
that speaks to me,

36:44.379 --> 36:46.480
and then speak back to it.

36:46.482 --> 36:47.653
This piece of wood last night

36:47.655 --> 36:48.998
was saying all kinds
of stuff about me

36:49.000 --> 36:50.549
that I didn't super-appreciate.

36:50.551 --> 36:52.206
But then this branch
kind of stepped in,

36:52.379 --> 36:55.308
and that was really nice to
have that backup from this.

36:55.310 --> 36:56.068
And at the end of the day

36:56.172 --> 36:57.724
we started decided
we could all be

36:57.896 --> 37:00.066
in sort of a flowing
argument with each other,

37:00.068 --> 37:02.586
and that would actually
produce something beautiful.

37:30.896 --> 37:32.446
This is my sanctuary,

37:32.448 --> 37:34.241
and these are my
Venice Beach buds.

37:35.931 --> 37:37.446
I don't really hang
out with these people

37:37.448 --> 37:38.446
outside of rollerblading

37:38.448 --> 37:40.379
so I've never actually
seen their feet.

37:40.931 --> 37:42.517
Or I've never seen
them in shoes.

37:44.206 --> 37:45.758
So they might not
even have feet.

37:45.862 --> 37:46.896
You know what I mean?

37:52.103 --> 37:53.896
These are some of
my Antifa friends.

37:54.241 --> 37:55.756
We actually have been following

37:55.758 --> 37:57.549
a Neo-Nazi online,
through Anonymous,

37:57.551 --> 37:58.689
and we have his address.

38:07.310 --> 38:09.655
So today we're gonna vote
on what to do with him.

38:09.827 --> 38:11.103
Let's go check it out.

38:11.310 --> 38:12.034
Hey guys, what's going on?

38:12.241 --> 38:13.825
Eddie, where's the armband?

38:13.827 --> 38:15.137
This is very important.

38:15.172 --> 38:15.862
What's going on?

38:15.931 --> 38:16.825
What's going on?
What's going on?

38:16.827 --> 38:17.517
Come on, come on, come on.

38:17.689 --> 38:19.172
I think they make
us look fascist.

38:20.137 --> 38:22.586
It makes us look very
structured, and there's order.

38:22.620 --> 38:24.827
And we're a uniform team.

38:25.172 --> 38:26.618
Why aren't we
talking about Erickson?

38:26.620 --> 38:27.740
We finally have his address.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.342
I think we should just,

38:29.344 --> 38:31.655
just take a step away
from that for a second

38:31.827 --> 38:34.342
to look at some other
ideas that I have.

38:34.344 --> 38:36.342
I think one would be
there's so many lawsuits

38:36.344 --> 38:38.791
and it's insane, you know.

38:38.793 --> 38:40.618
Malpractice is going on
at Ronald Reagan Center.

38:40.620 --> 38:42.413
I think we should
protest the hospital.

38:43.344 --> 38:45.653
I don't want to
vandalize a hospital.

38:45.655 --> 38:46.963
Okay, we'll move on.

38:46.965 --> 38:48.342
There's what, the veterans
associations have been,

38:48.344 --> 38:49.653
you know, people
have been protesting

38:49.655 --> 38:51.101
veterans associations
for so long because-

38:51.103 --> 38:52.480
- That's not what this is about.

38:52.482 --> 38:53.618
You're not understanding this.

38:53.620 --> 38:55.308
I mean, it's not like
we're protesting veterans.

38:55.310 --> 38:57.230
We're protesting the things
that go on at the VA.

38:57.275 --> 38:59.310
They need to understand
what this is nuts.

38:59.344 --> 39:00.344
I mean, don't-

39:02.034 --> 39:03.394
We finally have
Erickson's address.

39:03.517 --> 39:05.032
Why am I a crazy person?

39:05.034 --> 39:06.722
Am I the only one that cares
about what we're doing?

39:06.724 --> 39:07.724
I care.

39:08.862 --> 39:09.687
We'll take care of Herman.

39:09.689 --> 39:11.724
He's obsessed with Herman.

39:11.896 --> 39:14.584
So we just need to make
him feel uncomfortable.

39:14.586 --> 39:15.549
We need to kind of, you know,

39:15.551 --> 39:17.032
get rid of his social
media activity.

39:17.034 --> 39:18.034
What are some ideas?

39:21.034 --> 39:22.379
Kick him in the knees.

39:23.379 --> 39:24.551
I like that, actually.

39:26.896 --> 39:27.894
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

39:27.896 --> 39:29.170
Not not right now, no I'm sorry.

39:29.172 --> 39:30.206
1966.

39:31.379 --> 39:32.584
16th Street.

39:32.586 --> 39:34.034
You were never on 16th Street.

39:34.068 --> 39:35.239
That's right, we were there,

39:35.241 --> 39:36.411
I'll never forget it.

39:36.413 --> 39:37.275
Why is he standing?

39:37.379 --> 39:39.342
Remember like it
was, what did you say?

39:39.344 --> 39:40.756
Why are you standing?

39:40.758 --> 39:42.517
Because, you're
gonna learn something.

39:42.896 --> 39:44.170
You want to learn something?

39:44.172 --> 39:44.653
Then stop t-

39:44.655 --> 39:45.655
Shut up.

39:46.379 --> 39:48.894
16th Street, there we were.

39:48.896 --> 39:51.172
I remember like
it was yesterday.

39:51.379 --> 39:53.756
And Bill Ayres had
these pins made up.

39:53.758 --> 39:55.825
He got 'em right off the
press, hot off the press,

39:55.827 --> 39:57.239
passed them out to everybody.

39:57.241 --> 39:58.584
Is he even old enough for that?

39:58.586 --> 40:03.068
He wore this suede bandana

40:03.344 --> 40:06.206
that shined like the San
Francisco Bay at twilight.

40:06.241 --> 40:08.687
You were never on 16th Street.

40:08.689 --> 40:11.689
I was on 16th street
in the year in 1966,

40:11.758 --> 40:13.894
with Noam Chomsky,
and Bill Ayres,

40:13.896 --> 40:16.137
and he wore a suede bandana.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.860
Just sit down, just calm down.

40:18.862 --> 40:20.172
Get water or something.

40:22.655 --> 40:23.860
What about you two?

40:23.862 --> 40:24.894
Are you guys got
anything going on here?

40:24.896 --> 40:25.929
What's going on?

40:25.931 --> 40:27.687
Todd, you're just sitting
there doing nothing.

40:27.689 --> 40:29.411
Todd, Todd, do something.

40:29.413 --> 40:31.342
Oh do you want to go first or?

40:31.344 --> 40:32.724
No, just go.

40:32.862 --> 40:33.653
Are you sure?

40:33.655 --> 40:34.724
Yeah, I'm sure.

40:36.413 --> 40:37.894
I can't deal with
you two, either.

40:37.896 --> 40:39.825
This little weird little
thing you guys got going on.

40:39.827 --> 40:41.066
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

40:41.068 --> 40:44.034
There's these
spools in Echo Park,

40:44.068 --> 40:46.825
and Erickson usually
parks his car downhill,

40:46.827 --> 40:48.066
so it's sort of on a slant.

40:48.068 --> 40:50.034
So I was thinking maybe
we could get these spools

40:50.068 --> 40:51.204
and throw them at his car.

40:51.206 --> 40:52.515
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

40:52.517 --> 40:54.411
I think spools is a dumb idea.

40:54.413 --> 40:56.377
It's sending a message,

40:56.379 --> 40:58.722
but it's also a
little pragmatic,

40:58.724 --> 41:00.411
and you know we're
not getting, you know,

41:00.413 --> 41:01.756
into criminal trouble.

41:01.758 --> 41:03.273
How about we blow
up his fricking car?

41:03.275 --> 41:04.586
Please, this is insane.

41:04.620 --> 41:05.618
Why is that insane?

41:05.620 --> 41:07.101
I think that's a great idea.

41:07.103 --> 41:08.480
He's gonna know that
we're watching him,

41:08.482 --> 41:09.584
and he's gonna start posting

41:09.586 --> 41:11.653
all that frickingat
bullshit on social media.

41:11.655 --> 41:13.793
I think we're gonna
go with the spools.

41:15.310 --> 41:17.135
Yeah, it's just a
political discussion

41:17.137 --> 41:18.411
where everyone gets together.

41:18.413 --> 41:19.963
I am not
sitting in the same room

41:19.965 --> 41:21.135
as a Trump supporter.

41:21.137 --> 41:22.756
Political discussion where
everyone gets together.

41:22.758 --> 41:24.135
I'm sorry, I can't sit

41:24.137 --> 41:25.549
in the same room as a communist.

41:25.551 --> 41:26.241
Discussion?

41:26.448 --> 41:27.929
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

41:27.931 --> 41:29.446
I like conversations
that are actually

41:29.448 --> 41:30.929
the massive
linguistic difference.

41:30.931 --> 41:33.586
I'm sorry, we're not
attending, I'm sorry.

41:40.793 --> 41:42.413
It kind of like roams free.

41:42.482 --> 41:43.724
You're controlling it.

41:44.103 --> 41:45.480
Well yeah, it's the paradox.

41:45.482 --> 41:47.446
You know, there's a
paradox is a paradox.

41:47.448 --> 41:48.135
I am the paradox.

41:48.137 --> 41:49.137
I can't do this.

41:49.793 --> 41:50.793
Naya, I need your help.

41:59.379 --> 42:00.618
Oh, oh my God.

42:00.620 --> 42:01.620
Caesar!

42:04.827 --> 42:07.204
How's your back?

42:07.206 --> 42:09.793
I'll be fine, after
a little carving.

42:11.551 --> 42:13.894
Do you think having
mushrooms at the discussion

42:13.896 --> 42:15.722
is gonna have people
not take me seriously?

42:15.724 --> 42:18.860
No, some of the world's most
influential, powerful people

42:18.862 --> 42:20.482
eat mushrooms on the regular.

42:20.724 --> 42:21.998
You know, they're not
mutually exclusive.

42:22.000 --> 42:22.963
You want to have impact,

42:22.965 --> 42:24.791
have impact in all
spheres of your life.

42:24.793 --> 42:26.000
Don't limit your impact.

42:40.620 --> 42:41.620
Hey?

42:41.655 --> 42:43.860
Hey, yeah, I texted
you a couple of times.

42:43.862 --> 42:44.482
Did you get?

42:44.551 --> 42:47.551
Shrooms are looking Mondo.

42:47.689 --> 42:48.998
I just called to remind you

42:49.000 --> 42:50.549
that I'm gonna see you at
the protest tomorrow, right,

42:50.551 --> 42:51.618
with the mushrooms
that I ordered?

42:51.620 --> 42:52.482
9am sharp.

42:52.551 --> 42:54.206
I'm on top of it,
I'm a business guy.

42:54.482 --> 42:55.342
I don't screw up anymore.

42:55.344 --> 42:56.344
I'm-

42:57.862 --> 42:58.862
- Bye.

43:05.068 --> 43:05.756
Hi, how you doing sir?

43:05.758 --> 43:06.758
Hey.

43:07.275 --> 43:08.584
We're getting complaints
about your car over here,

43:08.586 --> 43:10.103
or hose inside your car.

43:10.448 --> 43:11.448
What's that about?

43:12.103 --> 43:15.241
I was gonna gas the
rats out of my attic.

43:15.586 --> 43:16.793
Oh really?

43:16.931 --> 43:19.101
And how are you gonna do that
with that hose on your car?

43:19.103 --> 43:21.273
I was gonna-same way humans
kill themselves.

43:21.275 --> 43:22.896
I was gonna run exhaust.

43:23.103 --> 43:26.068
Okay, I find that
a little strange.

43:27.793 --> 43:29.551
I don't know man,
this neighbor Derek,

43:29.896 --> 43:31.377
he's got the cops involved now.

43:31.379 --> 43:32.724
They showed up at my house.

43:32.793 --> 43:35.034
Nah man, you can't
have police around.

43:36.724 --> 43:38.103
I haven't even done anything.

43:38.275 --> 43:40.724
I just ran a hose from
the exhaust to the attic.

43:40.896 --> 43:42.206
Didn't turn the power on.

43:42.448 --> 43:43.931
Wasn't gassing anything.

43:44.379 --> 43:45.586
A man can do that.

43:45.724 --> 43:47.758
Yeah, no harm
there, case closed.

43:49.034 --> 43:50.034
How's your kafta?

43:51.068 --> 43:52.068
Good.

43:53.275 --> 43:54.862
I got Manny on delivery, man.

43:54.896 --> 43:56.066
I'm doing things differently.

43:56.068 --> 43:57.448
I'm showing up.

43:57.896 --> 44:00.066
I'm going to tell someone
I'm gonna sell them drugs

44:00.068 --> 44:01.482
at 9:00 a.m., and guess what?

44:01.517 --> 44:03.342
I'm gonna call them at 8:59.

44:03.344 --> 44:05.135
Another
bottle of wine gentlemen?

44:05.137 --> 44:07.137
No, thanks. I think we're
gonna have a white night.

44:40.448 --> 44:42.275
Is someone at the door?

44:45.000 --> 44:46.200
How can I help you today, sir?

44:47.620 --> 44:48.998
I didn't call the police.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.827
Did somebody call
the police on me?

44:51.655 --> 44:53.827
Got a call.

44:56.655 --> 44:57.482
Me, I'm good.

44:57.620 --> 44:59.172
Okay, all right sir.

44:59.620 --> 45:01.204
- Well, have a good day.
- Okay.

45:01.206 --> 45:01.998
Bye, take care.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.689
- Thank you.
- Bye.

45:35.655 --> 45:37.034
Hey Boyle, this is Naya.

45:38.172 --> 45:40.482
Hi, I'm on Sixth and
Spring, where are you?

45:40.724 --> 45:42.344
I'm on my way, 15 minutes.

45:42.379 --> 45:44.241
Yeah, I'm in the car.

45:44.413 --> 45:46.172
See you in 15 minutes.

45:46.551 --> 45:48.724
Drugs are menacing our society.

45:48.862 --> 45:50.102
They're threatening our values-

46:03.931 --> 46:04.722
We gotta go.

46:04.724 --> 46:05.896
All right, let's go.

46:14.896 --> 46:15.963
What's your damage?

46:15.965 --> 46:17.965
I gotta.

46:19.068 --> 46:20.480
Get your fucking jacket on man.

46:20.482 --> 46:21.620
I'm covered in filth.

46:35.137 --> 46:37.137
Where the fuck are you?

46:37.448 --> 46:39.655
It's, we're uh,

46:40.896 --> 46:41.965
is it on?

46:42.172 --> 46:43.480
I was walking around for an hour

46:43.482 --> 46:44.482
trying to find you.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.286
We're on our way,
we're on our away.

46:46.310 --> 46:47.310
We're almost there.

46:47.620 --> 46:48.872
We're there, we're almost there.

46:48.896 --> 46:49.896
Bye.

46:56.827 --> 46:58.068
Where is it?

46:58.310 --> 47:01.689
I don't know.

47:24.862 --> 47:26.170
If you don't want to come sir,

47:26.172 --> 47:28.066
why do you want him to be
the only one with guns?

47:28.068 --> 47:31.034
Man, that is not nice, I'm here.

47:31.758 --> 47:33.655
There's no reason
to flip me off.

49:01.827 --> 49:02.653
Where are you?

49:02.655 --> 49:03.825
I'm outside at Sixth and Spring,

49:03.827 --> 49:05.448
I'm outside of the protest.

49:06.827 --> 49:08.655
I'm the only one with pink hair.

49:46.517 --> 49:47.517
Where the hell were you?

49:47.655 --> 49:48.655
I don't know,

49:50.517 --> 49:51.446
I'm really freaked
out right now.

49:51.448 --> 49:52.308
Why?

49:52.310 --> 49:53.310
I don't know.

49:55.206 --> 49:56.480
Since you're here
are you gonna help me?

49:56.482 --> 49:57.689
No no no no no no.

49:58.655 --> 49:59.655
You said you were.

50:00.827 --> 50:01.827
I haven't slept.

50:03.137 --> 50:04.137
Okay fine.

50:37.137 --> 50:38.929
I don't know, maybe I'm
too much in my head about it,

50:38.931 --> 50:39.931
but I'm just,

50:40.344 --> 50:41.653
I'm just worried that
it's just gonna be

50:41.655 --> 50:45.103
some small gathering
where no one shows up.

50:45.827 --> 50:47.653
Well, I'm worried
I'm not gonna be able

50:47.655 --> 50:49.344
to shit for two weeks
because of my back.

50:49.448 --> 50:50.998
I don't know, maybe
I should just join

50:51.000 --> 50:53.653
some big political organization

50:53.655 --> 50:56.825
where I'm bound to have a
large impact, or something.

50:56.827 --> 50:59.135
Naya, I think there's
enough morons out there

50:59.137 --> 51:00.377
that you don't need to do that.

51:00.655 --> 51:01.825
You're great, you're wonderful.

51:01.827 --> 51:02.860
Bring your own spark,

51:02.862 --> 51:04.689
bring your own energy
to the discussion.

51:07.758 --> 51:08.758
I don't know.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.342
To feel my heart pin my ego

51:14.344 --> 51:16.517
for one open
timeless was moment,

51:16.620 --> 51:19.411
and the strange uncomfortable
space it created

51:19.413 --> 51:21.379
experience all joy,

51:22.448 --> 51:23.724
add some movement.

51:36.344 --> 51:37.722
Hi Naya, I know I said

51:37.724 --> 51:39.931
I could attend the discussion,

51:40.241 --> 51:43.206
but I don't think I can
anymore, I'm so sorry.

52:22.965 --> 52:24.756
That was the worst
idea Todd ever had.

52:24.758 --> 52:25.963
We didn't even
hit the right car.

52:25.965 --> 52:27.034
Deviled eggs,

52:28.344 --> 52:29.756
so delicious.

52:29.758 --> 52:31.170
The car's done, the car's done.

52:31.172 --> 52:32.655
No, it's not done.

52:32.689 --> 52:34.620
We need to do what I've
been saying all along.

52:34.896 --> 52:36.620
We blow up his fricking car.

52:36.655 --> 52:37.963
It's the perfect idea.

52:37.965 --> 52:39.342
He's gonna get freaked out.

52:39.344 --> 52:40.446
He's gonna leave town.

52:40.448 --> 52:42.308
We're not gonna
hurt him or anybody.

52:42.310 --> 52:43.687
We're just gonna
hurt his dumb car.

52:43.689 --> 52:44.618
We gotta stick to
the original plan

52:44.620 --> 52:46.448
doing social media

52:46.586 --> 52:48.066
and then getting a
presence out there,

52:48.482 --> 52:49.446
this kind of stuff.

52:49.448 --> 52:51.618
Noam Chomsky loved deviled eggs.

52:51.620 --> 52:52.793
Emmanuel stop.

52:53.172 --> 52:55.000
You shouldn't shout like that.

52:55.137 --> 52:56.551
Okay, thanks.

52:56.965 --> 52:58.825
Your obsession with social media

52:58.827 --> 53:01.034
is making us look
crazier and crazier.

53:01.137 --> 53:02.963
It's what the media
wants us to look like.

53:02.965 --> 53:04.377
We don't need to
be on social media.

53:04.379 --> 53:05.819
What are you accusing
me of, comrade?

53:07.379 --> 53:08.379
Eat a Dick.

53:10.724 --> 53:11.860
You're leaving?

53:11.862 --> 53:13.206
Yeah, Todd?

53:13.862 --> 53:15.000
I'm coming.

53:15.896 --> 53:16.620
Fuck you, Todd.

53:16.862 --> 53:19.275
You frivolous little weasel.

53:20.551 --> 53:21.860
Don't come too close.

53:21.862 --> 53:24.549
I remember Noam
Chomsky telling me.

53:24.551 --> 53:29.310
I told him something that he
tells me still to this day.

53:29.896 --> 53:31.379
And what he said,

53:31.413 --> 53:34.068
was what I said to him
is what he said to me.

53:34.137 --> 53:36.860
And what I told him,
is what he told me.

53:36.862 --> 53:38.377
And he told him, he told him.

53:38.379 --> 53:39.620
And I told him this.

53:40.862 --> 53:43.344
Milk is good.

53:44.068 --> 53:48.655
But, cream is great.

53:48.862 --> 53:51.172
Emmanuel, shut the fuck up.

53:51.241 --> 53:53.344
I mean, everything's
just falling apart, here.

53:53.379 --> 53:55.000
They leave and it's
just me and you like,

53:55.034 --> 53:55.860
this is terrible.

53:55.862 --> 53:57.377
Terrific!

53:57.379 --> 53:58.379
You're gonna be terrific,

53:58.482 --> 54:00.482
when you shut the fuck up
Emmanuel, how about that?

54:03.241 --> 54:04.586
Get the fuck out.

54:14.448 --> 54:15.756
Hey, what's up Boyle?

54:15.758 --> 54:16.756
It's Ceas.

54:16.758 --> 54:17.894
Hey, a favor to ask.

54:17.896 --> 54:20.549
Can you come grab this
big sphere for my friend?

54:20.551 --> 54:22.931
Yeah, yeah, it's like
stressing Naya out.

54:23.931 --> 54:25.586
All right, cool man, thank you.

55:19.862 --> 55:21.137
Sometimes smaller is better.

55:27.448 --> 55:28.482
How's your back?

55:29.172 --> 55:30.310
I think it might be broken.

55:39.586 --> 55:40.793
Good Mondo.

56:19.413 --> 56:21.239
I want to add tears

56:21.241 --> 56:24.549
with our drinks, our
holistic peace medicine,

56:24.551 --> 56:27.206
AKA magic mushrooms, so cheers.

56:29.620 --> 56:31.170
Something we're
here to talk about

56:31.172 --> 56:34.549
is Trump versus the
intelligence agencies,

56:34.551 --> 56:36.344
and now this shift.

56:36.379 --> 56:38.825
Being a Republican I
traditionally support

56:38.827 --> 56:40.342
our intelligence agencies.

56:40.344 --> 56:41.860
Being a veteran and
the wife of a veteran,

56:41.862 --> 56:44.377
I'm very disappointed
that we invaded Iraq,

56:44.379 --> 56:45.724
for basically nothing.

56:45.758 --> 56:47.032
It's convenient for the left

56:47.034 --> 56:49.379
to trust the CIA now,

56:49.413 --> 56:51.586
and it's convenient for
the right to distrust them.

56:51.655 --> 56:53.586
So it's politics.

56:53.620 --> 56:56.206
Now who is always being hurt?

56:56.241 --> 56:57.241
Poor people.

56:58.965 --> 56:59.894
I think I took too much

56:59.896 --> 57:00.965
of that potion.

57:13.310 --> 57:15.342
I mixed a bottle
of, it's part water,

57:15.344 --> 57:19.549
part liquid antacid and make
some liquid antacid water.

57:19.551 --> 57:21.413
And I call it L-A-W, law.

57:21.482 --> 57:22.963
So we can, we can just
put it on our eyes,

57:22.965 --> 57:24.241
and be a pepper spray.

57:24.896 --> 57:26.135
Here, I made it for you.

57:26.137 --> 57:27.135
Thanks.

57:27.137 --> 57:28.241
All right.

57:28.379 --> 57:29.379
Okay.

57:29.413 --> 57:31.584
Just like take a breath,
don't be a creep.

57:31.586 --> 57:32.137
Oh.

57:32.586 --> 57:34.137
Like we have to do that.

57:35.586 --> 57:36.480
Yeah, no I didn't.

57:36.482 --> 57:37.965
I didn't mean to be creepy.

57:38.586 --> 57:41.448
This is the road that
we're gonna be on, okay.

57:41.482 --> 57:42.998
And this is where
Herman's car is parked.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.963
It's always parked here,
in this corner right here.

57:44.965 --> 57:45.618
You see it.

57:45.620 --> 57:46.413
It was simple.

57:46.586 --> 57:48.411
And then here's you
with your dumb hair,

57:48.413 --> 57:51.066
and here's me and okay.

57:51.068 --> 57:52.135
And then you're gonna be holding

57:52.137 --> 57:53.894
the Molotov cocktails, okay?

57:53.896 --> 57:55.135
Hold them close to you.

57:55.137 --> 57:56.137
They're very dangerous.

57:56.172 --> 57:57.618
And like, I don't want
them to near my hair.

57:57.620 --> 57:59.308
And then what's gonna happen is,

57:59.310 --> 58:01.517
we're just gonna casually
stroll over to the car,

58:01.689 --> 58:02.689
just walk.

58:03.551 --> 58:05.206
I'm gonna light these,

58:05.482 --> 58:07.032
and then we're gonna
throw them at the car,

58:07.034 --> 58:09.793
and then we have 30
seconds, and then, bam!

58:10.206 --> 58:11.310
Explosion!

58:11.379 --> 58:13.517
Explosion, fire!

58:14.689 --> 58:17.034
And then you're gonna go east,

58:17.068 --> 58:18.170
and I'm gonna go west,

58:18.172 --> 58:19.965
and then that's gonna
be that for that.

58:21.551 --> 58:23.034
Does that make sense?

58:23.379 --> 58:25.034
Yeah, I mean, I
can also go west.

58:25.206 --> 58:26.206
No.

58:26.517 --> 58:28.825
Oh, for like safety
we'll split up?

58:28.827 --> 58:30.034
Yeah, it's for safety.

58:32.344 --> 58:34.000
Cool, it sounds like a plan.

58:35.517 --> 58:38.034
What, it doesn't sound
like a plan, it is a plan.

58:38.310 --> 58:42.310
We're not planning a surprise
party for your grandma, Todd.

58:42.862 --> 58:44.032
Yeah, no no,
that's what I meant.

58:44.034 --> 58:46.963
I just been like, I feel
like it's a good plan.

58:46.965 --> 58:47.860
It's a good plan.

58:47.862 --> 58:48.862
I'm excited to do this.

58:49.206 --> 58:50.551
Okay, you're excited?

58:50.655 --> 58:52.344
Yeah, I like to blow
stuff up with you.

58:56.379 --> 58:57.862
- I really like you.
- I hate you.

59:02.241 --> 59:04.549
Capitalism when truly
tried, never fails,

59:04.551 --> 59:05.722
it works all the time.

59:05.724 --> 59:08.756
This capitalistic system
that's purely based off,

59:08.758 --> 59:09.758
you know what?

59:09.896 --> 59:11.618
Everything starts to funnel
its way up to the top.

59:11.620 --> 59:14.204
I seriously ask does that
give you more choices or not?

59:14.206 --> 59:15.618
You think that
any of this matters

59:15.620 --> 59:16.740
unless we find the narwhals.

59:17.965 --> 59:20.862
Okay, so the year is
1955, Dimitri Mischkin,

59:21.034 --> 59:22.862
working for the Russian
government, right?

59:22.931 --> 59:23.860
You have this problem, right?

59:23.862 --> 59:24.965
You can't put the subs,

59:25.000 --> 59:26.446
you can't put the nukes
on the subs anymore.

59:26.448 --> 59:27.896
So they create NARWALS.

59:28.068 --> 59:32.275
Navel, atomic, radio wave
hidden, autonomous logic systems,

59:32.482 --> 59:34.618
that swim around,
no one can tell

59:34.620 --> 59:35.931
that they're fucking nukes.

59:36.206 --> 59:37.894
And then you have, you
your little tusks, right?

59:37.896 --> 59:39.894
The tusks how they
get the information

59:39.896 --> 59:41.379
from both Russia and the US.

59:41.448 --> 59:42.931
Dimitri comes to the US,

59:42.965 --> 59:45.125
brings all that information
to the American government.

59:45.310 --> 59:46.618
We all have to be hoping

59:46.620 --> 59:48.929
that Trump and Putin
actually get along,

59:48.931 --> 59:51.620
because that's the only chance
we have of finding them all.

59:51.655 --> 59:53.034
That's where it's coming from.

59:53.206 --> 59:54.758
It's all coming
up to the surface,

59:55.862 --> 59:57.931
into the clouds,
man, making it rain.

1:00:00.586 --> 1:00:01.963
He made a promise,

1:00:01.965 --> 1:00:04.273
he made a campaign promise
to overturn Roe v Wade,

1:00:04.275 --> 1:00:05.835
and we are now at
the precipice of that.

1:00:06.275 --> 1:00:07.549
Then there was the Green Party,

1:00:07.551 --> 1:00:08.239
then there was democrats.

1:00:08.241 --> 1:00:09.480
That's our five parties.

1:00:09.482 --> 1:00:10.618
What would end up happening is,

1:00:10.620 --> 1:00:12.101
they'd all have about
20-something percent.

1:00:12.103 --> 1:00:13.586
And then the tea parties...

1:00:27.620 --> 1:00:29.241
Why is everyone looking at me?

1:00:47.931 --> 1:00:50.206
Reciprocal, reciprocal,

1:00:50.241 --> 1:00:54.241
reciprocal,
reciprocal, reciprocal.

1:00:57.379 --> 1:00:58.379
Reciprocal.

1:00:58.413 --> 1:00:59.687
Reciprocal.

1:00:59.689 --> 1:01:01.482
I love the word, reciprocal.

1:01:01.655 --> 1:01:03.620
Reciprocal, such
an important word.

1:01:04.206 --> 1:01:06.653
Reciprocal, reciprocal,

1:01:06.655 --> 1:01:08.032
reciprocal, a word
that you're gonna hear

1:01:08.034 --> 1:01:10.482
more and more coming
from this administration.

1:01:12.896 --> 1:01:15.482
I would right
now in the State Senate.

1:01:21.689 --> 1:01:22.827
Bye guys.

1:01:34.275 --> 1:01:35.758
Fucking narwhals, be careful.

1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:55.680
These are heavier than
I thought they'd be.

1:01:55.827 --> 1:01:57.342
I feel like they're
splashing on me.

1:01:57.344 --> 1:01:58.135
Shut the fuck up.

1:01:58.137 --> 1:01:59.170
They're spilling on me.

1:01:59.172 --> 1:01:59.756
Stop.

1:01:59.758 --> 1:02:00.896
I'm sorry.

1:02:05.275 --> 1:02:06.377
I'm sorry.

1:02:06.379 --> 1:02:07.379
I'm sorry.

1:02:08.172 --> 1:02:09.379
I, I can't do this.

1:02:09.517 --> 1:02:12.206
I mean, I have a weak
constitution, I'm sorry.

1:03:31.793 --> 1:03:33.724
Hope they got the message.

1:03:41.965 --> 1:03:42.620
What's up, Boyle?

1:03:42.896 --> 1:03:43.965
Hey Daphne.

1:03:51.137 --> 1:03:52.241
Far out.

1:04:59.379 --> 1:05:03.584
The energy,
the ambition, the rejection,

1:05:03.586 --> 1:05:08.413
the joy and jubilation,
the Dreamers.

1:05:53.448 --> 1:05:54.724
Have you been crying?

1:06:01.793 --> 1:06:02.965
I'm practicing lines.

1:06:06.793 --> 1:06:08.310
We all dream, don't we?

1:07:01.034 --> 1:07:02.722
Tell me about this,
I want your feedback.

1:07:02.724 --> 1:07:04.000
Oh, totally.

1:07:05.551 --> 1:07:07.034
Will it knock me out?

1:07:10.206 --> 1:07:11.515
So what are you
boys up to, tonight?

1:07:11.517 --> 1:07:12.724
Cubs-Dodgers game.

1:07:13.241 --> 1:07:14.241
Baseball.

1:07:25.344 --> 1:07:26.722
Go Dodgers.

1:07:26.724 --> 1:07:27.827
Go Cubs.

1:07:28.172 --> 1:07:29.206
Bye.

1:07:55.068 --> 1:07:56.068
My grandmother.

1:07:56.896 --> 1:07:58.000
She was an actress, too.

1:07:58.793 --> 1:08:02.101
Actually, she was the
stand in for Grace Kelly

1:08:02.103 --> 1:08:03.998
in the movie, "High
Society" with Bing Crosby,

1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:05.620
and they became
really good friends.

1:08:08.310 --> 1:08:09.586
She never made it though.

1:08:11.241 --> 1:08:13.281
Pretty sure I'm the last
one left with her headshot.

1:08:18.344 --> 1:08:20.620
Oh, that's my manager.
One second.

1:08:22.274 --> 1:08:23.274
Hi, Xander.

1:08:23.724 --> 1:08:25.241
Xander, over here.

1:08:25.448 --> 1:08:27.585
Smile, Xander, smile.

1:08:27.655 --> 1:08:31.274
Here at the BGA viewing
party for the Academy Awards.

1:08:31.792 --> 1:08:33.241
You know, I don't
have any clients

1:08:33.309 --> 1:08:34.446
in there this year.

1:08:34.448 --> 1:08:36.309
Had a lot of clients up
for the roles, though.

1:08:36.655 --> 1:08:38.068
You know, which is a good thing.

1:08:48.274 --> 1:08:49.724
Filming, we're good friends.

1:09:00.309 --> 1:09:02.482
Can I get a vodka, please?

1:09:05.482 --> 1:09:06.482
I'm fine.

1:09:20.172 --> 1:09:22.135
You're nothing in this town
without your representation,

1:09:22.137 --> 1:09:23.482
and you know,

1:09:24.862 --> 1:09:26.517
I'm really lucky to
have Xander Hischier.

1:09:40.862 --> 1:09:44.033
My name is Barry Shay,
and I'm a personal trainer,

1:09:44.379 --> 1:09:46.894
and that helps me a lot
to stay in the game.

1:09:46.896 --> 1:09:49.724
You better have your shit
together, excuse my language.

1:09:49.896 --> 1:09:51.998
But that's the only way
you're gonna have a chance

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:53.482
to get your big break.

1:09:53.655 --> 1:09:54.344
Okay?

1:09:54.620 --> 1:09:56.687
But if you're a fat,
out-of-shape person,

1:09:56.689 --> 1:09:58.379
how you gonna have a future?

1:09:58.585 --> 1:10:01.000
This is only for the
fittest and the strongest.

1:10:06.309 --> 1:10:08.689
With a healthy mind
and a healthy body,

1:10:09.206 --> 1:10:11.137
nothing can stop you. Nothing.

1:10:11.550 --> 1:10:12.793
I believe that.

1:10:26.689 --> 1:10:27.689
Let's begin.

1:10:34.724 --> 1:10:36.000
What's the matter with you?

1:10:38.034 --> 1:10:39.965
I'll kill myself
the same way soon.

1:10:41.862 --> 1:10:43.309
I hardly recognize you.

1:10:44.206 --> 1:10:45.827
I hardly recognize you.

1:10:46.309 --> 1:10:49.000
You've changed towards
me, your eyes are so cold.

1:10:50.517 --> 1:10:52.655
My presence embarrasses you.

1:11:00.172 --> 1:11:01.413
What does that mean?

1:11:02.931 --> 1:11:06.206
I was vile enough to
kill a seagull today.

1:11:06.585 --> 1:11:07.724
I lay it at your feet.

1:11:07.931 --> 1:11:09.689
What's the matter with you?

1:11:11.550 --> 1:11:14.896
One full order of
Singapore Street Noodles.

1:11:24.034 --> 1:11:27.000
A few months from now,
this is gonna be a gym.

1:11:27.896 --> 1:11:28.931
Right there.

1:11:31.413 --> 1:11:33.585
Barry's Gym, a glittering sign.

1:11:34.379 --> 1:11:35.379
Come on in.

1:11:36.241 --> 1:11:37.724
Let's get some lights on.

1:11:44.585 --> 1:11:47.756
Me and the Missus, we talked
about this all the time.

1:11:47.758 --> 1:11:49.032
I just didn't have enough money,

1:11:49.034 --> 1:11:50.963
but now I got the money honey,

1:11:50.965 --> 1:11:53.411
and we're gonna have
this place up in no time.

1:11:53.413 --> 1:11:54.307
You know?

1:11:54.309 --> 1:11:55.722
Right here, in Hollywood.

1:11:55.724 --> 1:11:57.411
Can you believe it, man?

1:11:57.413 --> 1:11:59.931
We'll put a punching
bag over here, right?

1:12:05.517 --> 1:12:07.448
Thinking of kettle
bells over here, right?

1:12:10.827 --> 1:12:14.827
Exclusive Hollywood
stars, right?

1:12:14.965 --> 1:12:17.309
This place ain't no
dive, man, no no.

1:12:29.309 --> 1:12:30.793
I hardly recognize you.

1:12:32.275 --> 1:12:34.655
You've changed towards
me, your eyes are so cold.

1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:36.170
You're either looking
at the dead bird

1:12:36.172 --> 1:12:37.413
or at his stupid face.

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.000
Hey, look at his
stupid fucking face.

1:12:41.172 --> 1:12:43.655
Look at that stupid
fucking face.

1:12:43.827 --> 1:12:46.172
Look at his stupid fucking face.

1:12:46.206 --> 1:12:48.137
I don't have to
take this anymore!

1:12:57.827 --> 1:12:59.655
I was on "Mad About You" for,

1:13:00.034 --> 1:13:03.724
with Paul Reiser and Helen
Hunt, for two seasons.

1:13:06.034 --> 1:13:07.550
Do you think they hired me

1:13:08.068 --> 1:13:10.896
because I delivered my
lines looking at my feet?

1:13:13.379 --> 1:13:16.034
I am a real actress.

1:13:17.344 --> 1:13:18.896
I enjoy it.

1:13:19.827 --> 1:13:21.896
I revel in it.

1:13:23.758 --> 1:13:26.000
I am intoxicated on the stage.

1:13:27.931 --> 1:13:29.550
I feel beautiful there.

1:13:33.689 --> 1:13:36.172
And Mad About You fucking sucks!

1:13:38.275 --> 1:13:39.689
Kara, you're up.

1:13:40.585 --> 1:13:43.758
Ken, this is a man on the
verge of killing himself.

1:13:44.379 --> 1:13:46.068
I want you to go into the hall,

1:13:46.448 --> 1:13:47.827
put that gun in your mouth,

1:13:48.379 --> 1:13:50.724
and think about blowing
your dumb fucking head off.

1:14:09.137 --> 1:14:11.068
This show is so fucking good.

1:14:22.344 --> 1:14:23.550
Hey Armen.

1:14:23.931 --> 1:14:24.931
Barry.

1:14:25.309 --> 1:14:26.413
Meet over here.

1:14:26.793 --> 1:14:29.273
Listen, money's coming in

1:14:29.275 --> 1:14:31.241
a little slow right
now, you know.

1:14:31.896 --> 1:14:33.170
It's Hollywood property.

1:14:33.172 --> 1:14:34.241
It's very hot.

1:14:34.344 --> 1:14:35.965
Barry, you're a champion.

1:14:36.137 --> 1:14:37.585
I know you'll get the money.

1:14:37.896 --> 1:14:38.963
How much do you have right now?

1:14:38.965 --> 1:14:39.965
Today?

1:14:40.793 --> 1:14:42.480
Look, you're in
business man, right?

1:14:42.482 --> 1:14:44.827
You know how this goes,
I'll pay you back.

1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.448
You're a good man, and
I love business idea.

1:14:48.068 --> 1:14:49.482
How much do you have right now?

1:14:49.620 --> 1:14:51.309
Look, I can get it, okay?

1:14:51.585 --> 1:14:54.307
Just please don't sell it, okay.

1:14:54.309 --> 1:14:56.965
I'm gonna get you a
check for $30,000.

1:14:57.309 --> 1:15:00.689
So as long as you get me the
money, I hold the property.

1:15:01.034 --> 1:15:02.034
Sure.

1:15:16.517 --> 1:15:18.550
Hey Espar, Espar.

1:15:18.896 --> 1:15:21.480
Did I ever tell you
about my running race

1:15:21.482 --> 1:15:23.825
in Central Park in 1986?

1:15:23.827 --> 1:15:25.034
This was a 10 miler.

1:15:25.309 --> 1:15:27.135
Yeah, them were the days.

1:15:27.137 --> 1:15:29.965
Well, now I'm still running,
and I'm still in the game.

1:15:34.482 --> 1:15:36.344
Hey Boyle, I need to
ask you something.

1:15:37.206 --> 1:15:38.206
What's up?

1:15:38.862 --> 1:15:41.480
You know that gym I had
my eye on all this time,

1:15:41.482 --> 1:15:43.653
well I finally found
the place, it's great,

1:15:43.655 --> 1:15:45.411
but I need some more clients.

1:15:45.413 --> 1:15:46.689
Can you refer me some?

1:15:46.827 --> 1:15:47.862
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1:15:47.965 --> 1:15:48.515
Oh yeah.

1:15:48.517 --> 1:15:49.204
That'd be great,

1:15:49.206 --> 1:15:50.204
we'll get 'em all in the gym,

1:15:50.206 --> 1:15:51.620
we'll get them to losing weight,

1:15:51.793 --> 1:15:54.377
and it'll be a good thing, man.

1:15:54.379 --> 1:15:55.825
They drink too much soda.

1:15:55.827 --> 1:15:58.239
Oh yeah, they drink all
that crap, it's crazy.

1:15:58.241 --> 1:16:01.411
All that corn syrup
stuff and fat.

1:16:01.413 --> 1:16:02.446
Yeah, yeah.

1:16:02.448 --> 1:16:03.585
I don't drink it anymore.

1:16:03.965 --> 1:16:06.241
Yeah, well you know what?

1:16:07.448 --> 1:16:12.068
I got $25,000 already,
but I need 5,000 now.

1:16:12.103 --> 1:16:12.894
You need 5,000?

1:16:12.896 --> 1:16:13.860
I need 5,000.

1:16:13.862 --> 1:16:14.756
You want me to lend it to you?

1:16:14.758 --> 1:16:15.618
Can you do that?

1:16:15.620 --> 1:16:16.275
Oh yeah!

1:16:16.413 --> 1:16:17.413
All right.

1:16:17.758 --> 1:16:18.446
That'd be awesome.

1:16:18.448 --> 1:16:19.860
I appreciate that.

1:16:19.862 --> 1:16:21.000
Anything for you, Barry.

1:16:41.517 --> 1:16:42.413
Hey Armen?

1:16:42.448 --> 1:16:44.101
Here it is!

1:16:44.103 --> 1:16:46.550
It's Barry, the champion!

1:16:49.620 --> 1:16:51.241
You are good businessman.

1:16:51.585 --> 1:16:52.724
You are man of your word.

1:16:52.931 --> 1:16:54.241
Damn right I am.

1:17:01.482 --> 1:17:02.585
Hey Armen?

1:17:02.827 --> 1:17:04.172
It's Barry again.

1:17:04.482 --> 1:17:05.482
Talk to you later.

1:17:07.517 --> 1:17:09.480
Hey, this guy is really big.

1:17:09.482 --> 1:17:11.135
He must be major player.

1:17:11.137 --> 1:17:13.655
He's always on the phone,
never returns my calls.

1:17:13.827 --> 1:17:15.137
All right, bye.

1:17:16.172 --> 1:17:17.931
Property not listed.

1:17:20.206 --> 1:17:23.137
Oh shit, Espar, Espar
did you hear that?

1:17:23.448 --> 1:17:25.480
These yokels at the
bank are telling me

1:17:25.482 --> 1:17:26.965
the property's not listed.

1:17:50.206 --> 1:17:51.448
Hey Armen?

1:17:52.448 --> 1:17:53.756
Some mix-up at the bank.

1:17:53.758 --> 1:17:54.758
Barry, oh...

1:17:55.517 --> 1:17:56.825
There is always
mix up at the bank.

1:17:56.827 --> 1:17:58.655
The information's all wrong.

1:17:59.379 --> 1:18:00.825
Yes, red tape.

1:18:00.827 --> 1:18:02.344
I want to see
the property, okay?

1:18:03.241 --> 1:18:05.068
Property is
unavailable, it's sold.

1:18:05.585 --> 1:18:07.860
What? I gave you the money.

1:18:07.862 --> 1:18:09.206
You gave me the
money to hold it.

1:18:09.413 --> 1:18:10.618
Someone came with better offer.

1:18:10.620 --> 1:18:12.756
I gave you the money to hold it.

1:18:12.758 --> 1:18:14.241
You gave me chump change.

1:18:15.241 --> 1:18:16.482
Someone came with better offer.

1:18:16.517 --> 1:18:17.583
I take offer.

1:18:17.585 --> 1:18:19.172
It was all the money I had.

1:18:19.413 --> 1:18:20.724
You're a sad man.

1:18:20.827 --> 1:18:23.724
And your idea was stupid.

1:18:23.931 --> 1:18:24.931
You know what?

1:18:25.068 --> 1:18:26.344
You fuckin' asshole.

1:18:27.550 --> 1:18:28.517
Fuck you, pal.

1:18:28.550 --> 1:18:30.032
Okay, fuck you.

1:18:30.034 --> 1:18:33.068
Barry, leave me now.

1:18:33.413 --> 1:18:35.034
Don't embarrass yourself.

1:18:42.309 --> 1:18:43.309
Asshole.

1:19:21.344 --> 1:19:22.724
What do you think, Comet?

1:19:25.758 --> 1:19:26.758
I didn't get it.

1:19:29.413 --> 1:19:31.034
I didn't get the part.

1:19:37.413 --> 1:19:38.793
Don't bite, mommy.

1:19:39.482 --> 1:19:40.965
I have something to show you.

1:19:43.413 --> 1:19:44.583
What am I gonna do, huh?

1:19:44.585 --> 1:19:46.724
What can I do now?

1:19:49.137 --> 1:19:50.137
Shit.

1:21:02.550 --> 1:21:06.448
When in wait, I cried
the dream again.

1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:14.446
Ladies and gentlemen,
grandson of great, Bing Crosby,

1:22:14.448 --> 1:22:16.206
Bill Crosby, Junior.

1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:24.137
Hey Boyle?

1:23:24.275 --> 1:23:25.413
I'm here.

1:23:54.344 --> 1:23:55.929
I got a big time investor

1:23:55.931 --> 1:23:57.827
looking into Barry's
Gym, big time.

1:23:58.000 --> 1:23:59.275
- Big time?
- Yeah, yeah.

1:23:59.448 --> 1:24:01.032
- That's awesome.
- Yeah, you bet.

1:24:01.034 --> 1:24:01.517
You know what?

1:24:01.965 --> 1:24:04.000
You're gonna have
your money next week.

1:24:04.206 --> 1:24:05.482
I'm not worried about it.

1:24:06.448 --> 1:24:08.896
What the hell is
going on up there?

1:24:09.103 --> 1:24:10.273
There are rats in the attic.

1:24:10.275 --> 1:24:11.101
Rats?

1:24:11.103 --> 1:24:11.998
Yeah, a lot of them.

1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:13.101
You got rats up there?

1:24:13.103 --> 1:24:14.344
Yeah, a whole family.

1:24:14.793 --> 1:24:16.480
Why don't you do
something about it?

1:24:16.482 --> 1:24:17.482
Come on.

1:24:17.517 --> 1:24:19.550
I was, but I'm on a,
I'm on a new path now.

1:24:21.724 --> 1:24:22.862
I don't know, man.

1:24:22.896 --> 1:24:24.101
I'm having these visions,

1:24:24.103 --> 1:24:25.998
and I think I might just
live with these rats.

1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:27.756
I just kinda thought
I need my ways

1:24:27.758 --> 1:24:29.756
to not be so fucking
negative all the time.

1:24:29.758 --> 1:24:32.204
You got damned
rats in the attic.

1:24:32.206 --> 1:24:34.344
The world don't just stop.

1:24:34.550 --> 1:24:36.377
And fix your problems.

1:24:36.379 --> 1:24:38.379
You got to do something.

1:24:38.550 --> 1:24:39.756
I guess so, but I'm telling you-

1:24:39.758 --> 1:24:41.929
No, no, no, no.
You're not telling me anything.

1:24:41.931 --> 1:24:46.862
Listen kid, you got to
get your mind right, okay?

1:24:47.413 --> 1:24:50.585
You think I ask the
world to fix my problems?

1:24:50.724 --> 1:24:53.689
When things go sour at
the gym, no way, Jose.

1:24:53.724 --> 1:24:56.309
Not me, you get the wrong guy.

1:24:58.550 --> 1:25:02.068
You better get up there
and fix that yourself.

1:25:02.275 --> 1:25:03.585
Come on.

1:25:05.344 --> 1:25:07.620
It's only for you man,
I love you, come on,

1:25:07.655 --> 1:25:09.103
I want you to get right.

1:25:09.448 --> 1:25:10.724
Please.

1:25:11.793 --> 1:25:12.793
Shit.

1:25:13.655 --> 1:25:15.620
Come on Espar, let's
get out of here.

1:26:25.585 --> 1:26:27.344
Derek, it's your
neighbor, Boyle.

1:26:29.862 --> 1:26:31.482
Hey man, I just want to talk.

1:26:33.862 --> 1:26:35.689
Boyle, across the street.

1:26:36.793 --> 1:26:38.689
The guy gassing the rats.

1:27:00.137 --> 1:27:02.689
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1:27:25.965 --> 1:27:27.241
Oh no.

1:27:35.379 --> 1:27:36.517
Daphne!

1:27:40.482 --> 1:27:41.894
I'm going to jail.

1:27:41.896 --> 1:27:42.791
Like that's what's gonna happen.

1:27:42.793 --> 1:27:44.448
No, no no no no, we got it.

1:27:45.724 --> 1:27:47.550
I've been in this
situation before.

1:27:49.275 --> 1:27:50.585
You're not going to jail.

1:27:51.034 --> 1:27:52.411
We're gonna make sure
you don't go to jail.

1:27:52.413 --> 1:27:53.929
We can, we'll figure it out.

1:27:53.931 --> 1:27:55.585
You've been in this
situation before?

1:27:57.413 --> 1:27:59.032
No, Derek and Roger Stone,

1:27:59.034 --> 1:28:01.000
two fucking peas in a
fucking dick nose pod.

1:28:01.517 --> 1:28:02.620
God damn it.

1:28:04.379 --> 1:28:05.689
Who's Roger Stone?

1:28:06.206 --> 1:28:08.827
I don't know, ever heard
of a guy named Satan?

1:28:09.034 --> 1:28:10.206
He's worse than Satan.

1:28:10.517 --> 1:28:11.963
He worked for Nixon,

1:28:11.965 --> 1:28:14.482
and then in the 90's he
found his ultimate candidate.

1:28:15.172 --> 1:28:16.862
Yeah, fricking Trump.

1:28:16.896 --> 1:28:19.309
He's the one that convinced
Trump to run for office.

1:28:19.965 --> 1:28:22.687
And now, now I don't
know what he's doing.

1:28:22.689 --> 1:28:25.687
He's probably just like
eating cupcakes and cookies,

1:28:25.689 --> 1:28:27.653
running fake social
media accounts,

1:28:27.655 --> 1:28:28.827
astroturfing.

1:28:29.206 --> 1:28:31.998
Derek was a wolf in
sheep's clothing.

1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.517
I fricking knew something
was off with that guy.

1:28:34.689 --> 1:28:36.517
I think we should
protest the hospital.

1:28:36.620 --> 1:28:38.446
I think we should
go out and protest

1:28:38.448 --> 1:28:39.653
the veterans associations.

1:28:39.655 --> 1:28:40.895
They think they all look great.

1:28:45.689 --> 1:28:46.827
I'm going to jail.

1:28:48.275 --> 1:28:49.448
I know what to do.

1:29:07.172 --> 1:29:07.998
This is a heist.

1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:09.411
Of course I'm involved.

1:29:09.413 --> 1:29:10.825
I've been wanting to
make a heist movie

1:29:10.827 --> 1:29:12.241
since I saw "Asphalt Jungle."

1:29:12.724 --> 1:29:14.825
I mean, heist movies
are the pinnacle

1:29:14.827 --> 1:29:16.068
of the American experience.

1:29:16.413 --> 1:29:18.170
You've got flash,
you've got bang,

1:29:18.172 --> 1:29:20.550
romance, fortune,
you've got it all.

1:29:21.241 --> 1:29:23.068
And this, this needs production.

1:29:23.172 --> 1:29:25.068
This heist needs production.

1:29:25.413 --> 1:29:26.583
That's where I come in,

1:29:26.585 --> 1:29:28.825
because I produce
results, I'm a producer.

1:29:28.827 --> 1:29:30.724
Want laundry? I can produce it.

1:29:30.793 --> 1:29:32.756
You need a meal?
I can produce one.

1:29:32.758 --> 1:29:34.958
Do you need something stolen
from your neighbor's house?

1:29:35.482 --> 1:29:36.689
I can produce it.

1:29:38.413 --> 1:29:39.791
We're gonna rid Derek's place

1:29:39.793 --> 1:29:41.724
of anything incriminating
on all of us.

1:29:42.172 --> 1:29:43.446
How much time do we have?

1:29:43.448 --> 1:29:44.411
Like an hour and a half.

1:29:44.413 --> 1:29:45.411
And what happens if
he gets home early?

1:29:45.413 --> 1:29:46.413
What's your plan then?

1:29:48.034 --> 1:29:49.034
No plan.

1:29:49.068 --> 1:29:49.756
What's your plan?

1:29:49.758 --> 1:29:50.758
Give us a plan.

1:29:52.413 --> 1:29:53.517
We need a distraction.

1:29:55.448 --> 1:29:56.894
You've never been
to Venice before.

1:29:56.896 --> 1:29:58.273
You've just been mugged.

1:29:58.275 --> 1:30:00.241
You don't know
where to go, okay?

1:30:00.448 --> 1:30:02.000
Hi, oh my God, I'm so sorry.

1:30:03.413 --> 1:30:04.411
My phone just died.

1:30:04.413 --> 1:30:05.896
I'm not from here.

1:30:31.379 --> 1:30:32.862
Okay, listen here.

1:30:33.068 --> 1:30:34.550
Paveway Pictures
conference line.

1:30:35.068 --> 1:30:35.929
If you get disconnected,

1:30:35.931 --> 1:30:37.344
I've texted you
the number and pin.

1:30:37.550 --> 1:30:39.206
Okay, now here's the plan.

1:30:39.379 --> 1:30:40.618
According to Daphne,

1:30:40.620 --> 1:30:42.300
he'll be leaving at
approximately four p.m.

1:30:48.103 --> 1:30:50.068
I'll be stationed
close, watching.

1:30:50.241 --> 1:30:51.379
But once we know he's gone,

1:30:52.862 --> 1:30:54.137
clock is up,

1:30:54.689 --> 1:30:55.687
Anna, are we clear?

1:30:55.689 --> 1:30:56.827
All clear.

1:30:57.689 --> 1:30:58.896
We go.

1:31:03.482 --> 1:31:05.275
Daphne will break
into Derek's house.

1:31:10.413 --> 1:31:11.583
All right, luck on our side,

1:31:11.585 --> 1:31:12.758
We've got a solid hour-15.

1:31:12.793 --> 1:31:13.482
Copy.

1:31:13.655 --> 1:31:14.998
Boyle, you get
the car ready to go,

1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:15.998
and begin the gassing.

1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:17.275
That's the key time sync.

1:31:26.137 --> 1:31:27.413
Update, all clear.

1:31:38.655 --> 1:31:39.515
This is kind of fun.

1:31:39.517 --> 1:31:40.480
What the fuck are you doing?

1:31:40.482 --> 1:31:41.722
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you doing?

1:31:41.724 --> 1:31:42.724
Get in position.

1:31:42.862 --> 1:31:44.422
You're supposed to
be doing the gassing.

1:31:51.758 --> 1:31:52.931
I'm in.

1:31:53.034 --> 1:31:54.480
With the gas going,
your priority would be

1:31:54.482 --> 1:31:56.550
to assist Daphne
inside the house.

1:32:02.758 --> 1:32:04.827
Daphne, tell Boyle to
put his headphones on.

1:32:06.517 --> 1:32:08.204
Daphne will hack
Derek's computer,

1:32:08.206 --> 1:32:09.689
and proceed to scrub it clean.

1:32:18.034 --> 1:32:19.034
I'm in.

1:32:20.550 --> 1:32:21.722
Yeah, we can hear you.

1:32:21.724 --> 1:32:23.517
Put your headphones
in, Ted's freaking out.

1:32:31.862 --> 1:32:34.032
Voluntary institutions
of civil society

1:32:34.034 --> 1:32:35.515
that provided social services,

1:32:35.517 --> 1:32:36.724
medical care and education

1:32:36.793 --> 1:32:39.010
were deliberately targeted for
destruction, in some cases.

1:32:39.034 --> 1:32:40.342
Were normal words
coming out of my mouth?

1:32:40.344 --> 1:32:41.655
I just hear gibberish.

1:32:42.137 --> 1:32:43.137
Just please.

1:32:43.172 --> 1:32:44.687
Can you put that down,
and stick to the plan?

1:32:44.689 --> 1:32:45.722
What's the plan?

1:32:45.724 --> 1:32:46.894
Just get rid of that.

1:32:46.896 --> 1:32:48.548
Boyle will get
rid of all the photos

1:32:48.550 --> 1:32:50.344
and all the physical
evidence lying around.

1:32:56.862 --> 1:32:58.687
Once you're both done
with those tasks,

1:32:58.689 --> 1:33:00.068
we move on to phase two.

1:33:00.965 --> 1:33:02.307
Boyle, you finish cleaning up,

1:33:02.309 --> 1:33:04.549
and you run back across the
street to finish the gassing.

1:33:04.931 --> 1:33:06.758
Daphne, you hurry
up and get out.

1:33:10.896 --> 1:33:12.791
Anna will wait on standby,

1:33:12.793 --> 1:33:15.033
and you give the first heads
up, or run any interference.

1:33:15.241 --> 1:33:16.724
Anna, we clear?

1:33:18.931 --> 1:33:20.206
We're clear.

1:33:20.758 --> 1:33:21.758
Copy.

1:33:26.862 --> 1:33:28.377
Gassing looks good, no leakage,

1:33:28.379 --> 1:33:29.585
definitely still going.

1:33:29.620 --> 1:33:31.034
He's on time.

1:33:32.103 --> 1:33:35.101
10-4, roger that, copy
you, copy you, copy you.

1:33:35.103 --> 1:33:36.275
One, two, three.

1:33:36.344 --> 1:33:38.625
Change of plans, I'm gonna
have to destroy the hard drive.

1:33:40.034 --> 1:33:42.929
No time, no time
and unnecessary.

1:33:42.931 --> 1:33:44.379
That's not part of the plan.

1:33:44.585 --> 1:33:46.101
Okay well yeah,
that's what I'm doing.

1:33:46.103 --> 1:33:49.344
So, and you need
to just fuck off.

1:33:58.241 --> 1:33:59.342
Can you hear that?

1:33:59.344 --> 1:34:00.482
Hear what?

1:34:01.655 --> 1:34:02.446
Where'd you go?

1:34:02.448 --> 1:34:03.793
Where are you going?

1:34:03.827 --> 1:34:05.068
Boyle, status?

1:34:10.448 --> 1:34:13.342
Guys, I need to find this,
there's, I'm having a feeling.

1:34:13.344 --> 1:34:14.204
What? No, no, no, no, no.

1:34:14.206 --> 1:34:15.342
What are you doing?

1:34:15.344 --> 1:34:17.517
No, you need to get your
ass back over to the car.

1:34:17.689 --> 1:34:19.309
The gassing should
be almost done.

1:34:29.172 --> 1:34:30.172
He's coming.

1:34:30.309 --> 1:34:31.585
I think it's him.

1:34:31.827 --> 1:34:32.827
It's him, it's him.

1:34:33.517 --> 1:34:34.756
He's wearing a green helmet.

1:34:34.758 --> 1:34:35.827
Distract him.

1:34:35.965 --> 1:34:37.620
Anna, you're a
fucking star today.

1:34:43.413 --> 1:34:44.965
Boyle, Daphne.

1:34:45.620 --> 1:34:46.860
Guys, I'm back.

1:34:46.862 --> 1:34:48.862
The hard drive has been
successfully destroyed.

1:34:49.034 --> 1:34:50.954
I have no idea where Boyle
is or what he's doing.

1:34:56.793 --> 1:34:58.101
If you can hear me, wrap it up.

1:34:58.103 --> 1:34:59.103
Let's go.

1:35:00.896 --> 1:35:02.827
I'm sorry, my phone's dead too.

1:35:02.931 --> 1:35:04.309
Putting up the prize.

1:35:13.689 --> 1:35:15.170
Maybe I could get your number,

1:35:15.172 --> 1:35:16.860
and we could talk
at a later date?

1:35:16.862 --> 1:35:18.239
My phone's dead.

1:35:18.241 --> 1:35:19.239
I don't know. How would I
get your number?

1:35:19.241 --> 1:35:20.448
That makes no sense.

1:35:20.517 --> 1:35:22.411
You can tell me, I actually
have a photographic memory.

1:35:22.413 --> 1:35:23.515
Boyle?

1:35:23.517 --> 1:35:24.239
I'm coming.

1:35:24.241 --> 1:35:25.550
Okay, hurry up.

1:35:25.827 --> 1:35:27.032
I'm leaving now.

1:35:27.034 --> 1:35:28.034
Okay.

1:35:37.241 --> 1:35:39.758
And then you take a left,
and you go about a mile,

1:35:39.793 --> 1:35:41.424
and you'll see the
ocean, the Pacific Ocean.

1:35:41.448 --> 1:35:42.550
Is it an obvious left,

1:35:42.724 --> 1:35:44.377
or one of those lefts that's
kind of like sneaky, you know?

1:35:44.379 --> 1:35:45.411
A sneaky left?

1:35:45.413 --> 1:35:46.963
Yeah, like somehow
the roads are curved.

1:35:46.965 --> 1:35:49.515
What's sneaky, I don't know
what it means, a sneaky left.

1:35:49.517 --> 1:35:50.860
All right guys, I'm exiting.

1:35:50.862 --> 1:35:51.894
I gotta go now.

1:35:51.896 --> 1:35:53.034
I gotta go.

1:36:09.344 --> 1:36:10.448
Cutting the gas.

1:36:16.068 --> 1:36:17.583
Really, this is just too much.

1:36:17.585 --> 1:36:20.791
Please, please, please,
I just need more exact direction.

1:36:20.793 --> 1:36:22.827
Oh watch out for
the pool cleaners.

1:36:33.137 --> 1:36:34.275
Here boy, it's me.

1:36:34.793 --> 1:36:37.379
It's me, it's me
Zappo, come here.

1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:41.000
I know.

1:37:05.309 --> 1:37:07.480
You gotta get out,
you have maybe 10 seconds.

1:37:07.482 --> 1:37:09.162
Boyle, he's coming up
the stairs right now.

1:38:31.758 --> 1:38:33.241
You're not groovy, man.

1:38:35.931 --> 1:38:37.241
Perhaps I'm not.

1:39:20.724 --> 1:39:22.653
Ah, things seem right again

1:39:22.655 --> 1:39:24.482
at the old Boyle house.

1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:47.413
I'll walk you out, man.

1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:56.929
So what, you're leaving?

1:39:56.931 --> 1:39:58.620
I'm going back to the bulk.

1:39:59.000 --> 1:39:59.791
Can I come?

1:39:59.793 --> 1:40:00.860
I'm afraid you cannot.

1:40:00.862 --> 1:40:01.618
Is it groovy?

1:40:01.620 --> 1:40:02.793
It is.

1:40:03.827 --> 1:40:04.827
All right.

1:40:04.931 --> 1:40:06.653
I have one
more thing to say to you.

1:40:06.655 --> 1:40:07.653
What's that?

1:40:07.655 --> 1:40:08.653
Thank you.

1:40:08.655 --> 1:40:10.827
Oh no, thank you, man.

1:40:11.309 --> 1:40:12.689
I'm gonna miss you.

1:40:12.862 --> 1:40:14.482
I'll miss you too, Boyle.

1:40:14.862 --> 1:40:15.756
Yeah yeah yeah.

1:40:15.758 --> 1:40:16.931
Groovy.

1:40:23.724 --> 1:40:26.827
Boyle indeed, is
the man who knows.

1:40:29.309 --> 1:40:33.309
Perhaps I was skeptical at
first, but he does know.

1:40:33.862 --> 1:40:35.448
He knows Mondo.

1:40:35.793 --> 1:40:40.000
The language, the
true cosmic language.

1:40:40.344 --> 1:40:42.137
A little piece of this Earth.

1:40:42.655 --> 1:40:44.758
A space bound to time.

1:40:53.137 --> 1:40:55.860
Even if this land of Hollywood

1:40:55.862 --> 1:40:59.066
were to vanish into
oblivion in an instant,

1:40:59.068 --> 1:41:04.724
and this happened tomorrow,
it's legacy would never leave.

1:41:08.413 --> 1:41:11.137
Forever, there
will be The Titan,

1:41:14.172 --> 1:41:15.862
The Weirdo,

1:41:19.550 --> 1:41:20.724
The Dreamer,

1:41:23.758 --> 1:41:27.379
and so forever there
will be Hollywood.

1:41:27.585 --> 1:41:30.000
Forever groovy, forever.

1:41:31.862 --> 1:41:33.379
Mondo.
