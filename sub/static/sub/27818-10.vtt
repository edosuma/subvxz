WEBVTT

00:02.195 --> 00:03.608
Shit!

00:05.126 --> 00:06.298
Bitch, it's 10:04!

00:06.299 --> 00:07.884
I overslept! I packed my alarm!

00:07.885 --> 00:09.505
I'll change so fast!

00:09.506 --> 00:11.229
No bra! Save time!

00:11.230 --> 00:13.505
- It's 10:44.
- Okay, we got this.

00:13.506 --> 00:16.193
I am not letting you miss
your last NYCBEC, bitch!

00:22.506 --> 00:25.367
I think we might get it, dude!

00:25.368 --> 00:26.712
Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:26.713 --> 00:27.884
- Okay.
- Come on, sister.

00:27.885 --> 00:29.643
Come on. We don't got time!

00:32.023 --> 00:33.643
Ma'ams, children are dying!

00:33.644 --> 00:35.160
Ilana, cat pass!

00:35.161 --> 00:37.229
They're starving! They're so hungry!

00:37.230 --> 00:38.746
You need to feed them!

00:38.747 --> 00:41.781
From the moment they're born,
they're dying!

00:41.782 --> 00:42.782
This isn't the end!

00:42.783 --> 00:44.229
Get us!

00:44.230 --> 00:45.863
- We're almost there.
- We're so close. Yes.

00:45.874 --> 00:48.436
Get ready for the best bacon,
egg, and cheese in New York City.

00:49.506 --> 00:50.539
What?

00:52.195 --> 00:53.815
Oh, no!

00:58.376 --> 01:00.893
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:00.904 --> 01:03.125
I can't believe that the bodega

01:03.126 --> 01:05.919
with the best bacon, egg,
and cheese is literally gone.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.781
Okay, it's okay.

01:07.782 --> 01:10.470
We're gonna get one right now
and forget that ever happened

01:10.471 --> 01:11.884
when we're taking painful

01:11.885 --> 01:13.616
bacon, egg, and cheese shits
later, okay?

01:13.627 --> 01:15.815
- Oh, I can't wait.
- Come on.

01:15.816 --> 01:17.953
You're listening to Hot 97.

01:17.954 --> 01:20.229
Ugh, the sign. Let's lay on the charm.
Here we go.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.884
- My goodness.
- Wow.

01:26.885 --> 01:29.608
So much on the menu
that looks delicious.

01:29.609 --> 01:31.608
- Yeah.
- What do we get?

01:31.609 --> 01:33.160
I know it's "wate,"

01:33.161 --> 01:35.746
but I really would like
some "bweakfast" food.

01:35.747 --> 01:38.229
Hey, hunky boy.

01:38.230 --> 01:41.643
Hi. Hi.

01:41.644 --> 01:46.712
Can we get two bacon, egg, and cheeses?

01:46.713 --> 01:48.850
Nope. No eggs after 11:00.

01:48.851 --> 01:50.194
You know what?

01:50.195 --> 01:52.884
This is this angel's final breakfast

01:52.885 --> 01:54.194
- in New York City.
- Yeah.

01:54.195 --> 01:57.505
Before she goes and rebuilds homes
for Christian tsunami victims.

01:57.506 --> 01:58.919
Okay, that's not true.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.298
And you are gonna deny her this?

02:00.299 --> 02:02.850
You are gonna deny her this Make-A-Wish?

02:02.851 --> 02:05.332
For shame.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.091
Shame!

02:07.092 --> 02:08.193
Shame!

02:08.195 --> 02:09.505
Shame!

02:14.989 --> 02:17.263
Yeah, yeah.

02:17.264 --> 02:20.953
I'm just gonna leave some money
for you fellas.

02:20.954 --> 02:22.583
That was inappropriate.

02:30.126 --> 02:33.470
I feel better. Let's go.

02:33.471 --> 02:36.125
- This is gonna be delish.
- We got this.

02:36.126 --> 02:39.091
- We got this.
- Jesus Christ.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.781
Oh, no, no. We're not doing this.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.125
I can't believe we couldn't find you

02:47.126 --> 02:49.953
one last bacon, egg, and cheese
before you go.

02:49.954 --> 02:51.298
I failed you.

02:51.299 --> 02:52.953
No, you didn't, dude.

02:52.954 --> 02:55.056
And also, maybe I, like,
can buy the ingredients.

02:55.057 --> 02:58.022
We could FaceTime
while I make it in Boulder.

02:58.023 --> 02:59.263
Oh, God.

02:59.264 --> 03:00.815
It's not the bacon, egg, and cheese.

03:00.816 --> 03:03.401
It's just... oh, God!

03:03.402 --> 03:05.608
Why the fuck would you go to Boulder?

03:05.609 --> 03:07.850
I mean, well, mainly for
the residency program.

03:07.851 --> 03:09.367
Yeah, yeah, residency,

03:09.368 --> 03:11.963
but... but what the fuck
is the culture there? Rocks?

03:11.974 --> 03:14.091
What could you possibly find at Boulder?

03:14.092 --> 03:16.505
What does Colorado have to offer
that New York City doesn't?

03:16.506 --> 03:18.884
Well, for one, recreational weed.

03:20.023 --> 03:21.263
Right.

03:21.264 --> 03:23.263
Yeah, but you're gonna come so soon.

03:23.264 --> 03:24.479
Oh, my God!

03:24.490 --> 03:26.252
I told you you can come
whenever you want.

03:26.263 --> 03:29.056
No, look. Oh.

03:29.057 --> 03:30.988
It is. It is!

03:32.506 --> 03:34.608
New York City, you've done it again!

03:34.609 --> 03:37.056
Abbi, this is a Wa-Unchi toilet.

03:37.057 --> 03:38.436
Don't you see?

03:38.437 --> 03:40.332
We thought we were on some classic

03:40.333 --> 03:42.263
Abbi and Ilana New York City
journey today.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.366
We thought it was for
the bacon, egg, and cheese.

03:44.377 --> 03:47.712
When, in fact, this was
our mission all along.

03:47.713 --> 03:50.263
Okay.

03:50.264 --> 03:54.574
Okay, but... so... so, what is
exactly the new mission now?

03:54.575 --> 03:56.815
This toilet. We're gonna
bring it back to my house.

03:56.816 --> 04:00.574
Are you... sure?

04:00.575 --> 04:02.781
Abbi, this is a Wa-Unchi.

04:02.782 --> 04:05.436
It's an intelligent toilet with
an UV light that breaks down

04:05.437 --> 04:07.850
the germs of fecal matter in the bowl.

04:07.851 --> 04:10.781
It has a heated seat and warm
water that sprays in your ass

04:10.782 --> 04:12.815
after you take a dump just like a bidet.

04:12.816 --> 04:15.401
God, every time you are sprayed,
you are reborn.

04:15.402 --> 04:16.952
Okay, Ilana, this is someone else's.

04:16.954 --> 04:18.952
This is gross.
Just don't touch it so much.

04:18.954 --> 04:22.574
Abbi, this was our tiny little
mission for the day.

04:22.575 --> 04:24.746
Come on. It's a $10,000 toilet.

04:24.747 --> 04:27.506
- Wow.
- I need this.

04:29.264 --> 04:30.815
Yeah, okay, yeah.

04:30.816 --> 04:33.988
Let's... you know what?
Let's take the toilet home!

04:33.989 --> 04:35.401
You won't regret it, mister!

04:35.402 --> 04:36.470
- I'll get a cab.
- Okay.

04:36.471 --> 04:39.401
Yeah, hey, yes.

04:39.402 --> 04:41.505
Okay. Tilt.

04:41.506 --> 04:42.953
- I'll do this.
- Legs.

04:42.954 --> 04:44.436
Legs. Step.

04:44.437 --> 04:47.229
Yeah.

04:47.230 --> 04:48.332
You dick!

04:48.333 --> 04:50.125
Toilet discrimination.

04:50.126 --> 04:52.125
Okay, um...

04:52.126 --> 04:54.263
Okay.

04:54.264 --> 04:55.746
Whoo.

04:55.747 --> 04:58.539
Jesus. Uber is surging
60 times the normal rate.

04:58.540 --> 05:00.332
Okay, I'll... I'll just call us a Lyft.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.677
Woof, my rating is very low.

05:02.678 --> 05:05.401
Probably from the pee incident.

05:05.402 --> 05:06.746
Again, sorry about that.

05:06.747 --> 05:08.299
- Totally fine.
- All right.

05:08.310 --> 05:10.689
How are we gonna get this toilet
back to Brooklyn?

05:12.000 --> 05:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:24.057 --> 05:26.367
We're gonna walk it across the bridge?

05:26.368 --> 05:27.851
That's right.

05:29.489 --> 05:31.248
Kids are suckers, man.

05:31.259 --> 05:33.292
70 bucks for an old skateboard?

05:33.293 --> 05:35.361
Too easy.

05:35.362 --> 05:36.706
I can't believe we've never walked

05:36.707 --> 05:38.430
across the Brooklyn Bridge together.

05:38.431 --> 05:41.085
Yeah, it's kind of nuts that we
managed to do it individually.

05:41.086 --> 05:43.707
I mean, we're almost always together.

05:45.535 --> 05:47.948
Ilana, I'm really proud of you, dude.

05:47.949 --> 05:49.844
I mean, obviously,
for going back to school

05:49.845 --> 05:51.948
to become the most badass therapist

05:51.949 --> 05:53.534
New York City has ever seen,

05:53.535 --> 05:55.223
but also for the Phone Wigs!

05:55.224 --> 05:57.844
I mean, I really feel like
you have something there.

05:57.845 --> 05:59.706
Like, that has legs, you know?

05:59.707 --> 06:02.189
We have so many dope ideas.

06:02.190 --> 06:03.603
We have to make sure

06:03.604 --> 06:05.499
we keep up the brainstorming
sessions going.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.913
It's really important.

06:06.914 --> 06:11.189
I mean, I strongly, strongly believe in

06:11.190 --> 06:14.396
the joint gynecologist/
waxing/laser hair removal thing.

06:14.397 --> 06:16.672
- Oh, yeah.
- It's like a one-stop shop.

06:16.673 --> 06:18.327
Come on, that's genius.

06:18.328 --> 06:21.154
I mean, I still also believe in
the Dorito dust.

06:21.155 --> 06:23.258
I mean, I'm just eating the chip
for the dust.

06:23.259 --> 06:25.499
- Exactly.
- And it's like cut out the middleman

06:25.500 --> 06:27.568
and get me a vial straight of that dust

06:27.569 --> 06:29.430
for spicing or for swigging.

06:29.431 --> 06:34.051
I just found out, dude,
that Doritos are tortilla chips.

06:34.052 --> 06:36.361
- Wild.
- I mean, no one talks about that.

06:38.535 --> 06:41.120
Abbi, I've been thinking a lot

06:41.121 --> 06:42.913
about this whole end-of-the-world thing.

06:42.914 --> 06:44.258
If the apocalypse happens,

06:44.259 --> 06:46.258
we're not gonna be in the same city.

06:46.259 --> 06:49.017
Shit. If we're not in the same city,

06:49.018 --> 06:51.085
how are we supposed to find each other?

06:51.086 --> 06:52.948
Once the electricity goes down,

06:52.949 --> 06:55.430
all the banks are gonna be
hacked and drained.

06:55.431 --> 06:58.427
- That's exactly what is going to happen.
- Hey, look, a Wa-Unchi.

06:58.438 --> 07:00.844
You know what? First thing you
do when you get to Boulder,

07:00.845 --> 07:03.292
you go to the bank.
You take out a shit ton of cash.

07:03.293 --> 07:04.982
I'm talking half your savings, okay?

07:04.983 --> 07:07.637
You go back to your dorm.
You find a loose floorboard.

07:07.638 --> 07:10.189
You pry it open,
and you stuff the cash in there.

07:10.190 --> 07:12.499
You create a hidden nook.
Shit's gonna be nuts.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.017
Ooh, I love hidden nooks. I'm on it.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.499
I read this article... well, headline...

07:17.500 --> 07:20.349
that said that only four days
after it all goes dark,

07:20.360 --> 07:22.396
New Yorkers are gonna
start killing each other.

07:22.397 --> 07:25.154
We got to get out of the cities
and have cash on hand.

07:25.155 --> 07:26.637
Yeah. We're also gonna need

07:26.638 --> 07:28.637
those straws that allow you
to drink your own pee.

07:28.638 --> 07:30.120
We're gonna need to get that gel

07:30.121 --> 07:32.338
that marathoners use for,
like, energy and shit.

07:32.349 --> 07:34.120
Oh, we're also gonna need to
get those pants

07:34.121 --> 07:36.154
that zip and become shorts
so you have both.

07:36.155 --> 07:38.067
You're gonna have to stock up on
your contact lenses.

07:38.078 --> 07:39.430
But I really, really think

07:39.431 --> 07:41.637
you should consider doing Lasik,
for real.

07:41.638 --> 07:44.465
Good call. Good call. Okay, where
should we plan to meet up?

07:44.466 --> 07:46.154
All right. Why don't I pull up the map?

07:46.155 --> 07:47.843
Hold on.

07:48.431 --> 07:51.300
All right, well, it looks like St.
Louis is right in the middle.

07:51.311 --> 07:53.085
I mean, we could meet right in
the middle of the arch.

07:53.086 --> 07:54.672
This is so funny.

07:54.673 --> 07:57.189
Colorado is where I thought Montana was.

07:57.190 --> 08:00.017
You're gonna be actually where
I thought Oklahoma was.

08:00.018 --> 08:01.637
That's cool. Mormons are dope.

08:01.638 --> 08:04.465
Well, I think Utah is actually
the Mormon area.

08:04.466 --> 08:06.499
Oh, right, right, right.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.510
- Momo's still dope, though.
- Yeah.

08:08.521 --> 08:12.051
Abbi, promise me when you get to
Colorado, you're also gonna get a bike

08:12.052 --> 08:14.844
'cause that's why everybody's gonna
be killing each other for the gas.

08:14.845 --> 08:16.672
Bike's are the O.G. best friends
of people.

08:16.673 --> 08:18.292
Whew, okay, I'll get a bike.

08:18.293 --> 08:20.051
Hey, let's stop over here for a second.

08:20.052 --> 08:21.052
Okay.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.637
Should we write something?

08:29.638 --> 08:31.397
Yeah.

08:34.466 --> 08:36.982
Yeah.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.948
So, should we, uh... should we jump?

08:46.362 --> 08:48.189
Yeah.

08:48.190 --> 08:50.189
No, seriously, should we jump?

08:51.880 --> 08:55.051
We can't. We have our big
dinner date tonight.

08:55.052 --> 08:57.430
You said the reservations were,
like, really hard to get.

08:57.431 --> 08:59.190
- That's true.
- We got to go.

09:04.949 --> 09:08.775
Ilana, I'm... I'm really scared.

09:08.776 --> 09:10.603
I'm, like...

09:10.604 --> 09:12.879
I'm moving across the country

09:12.880 --> 09:16.603
and, like, changing my whole life?

09:16.604 --> 09:18.741
I mean, I'm...
I'm not gonna know anybody.

09:18.742 --> 09:21.465
I'm really scared of the change, too,

09:21.466 --> 09:24.568
but we're both gonna be better for it.

09:24.569 --> 09:26.948
You really think so?

09:26.949 --> 09:29.397
I know it. I know it.

09:32.811 --> 09:34.982
You know, Ilana, me and you...

09:34.983 --> 09:38.189
we're still gonna be us, no matter what.

09:38.190 --> 09:40.292
That's never gonna change.

09:40.293 --> 09:41.706
Even if we're in different cities,

09:41.707 --> 09:43.603
that's never gonna change.

09:43.604 --> 09:46.430
I know.

09:46.431 --> 09:49.913
But it is gonna change.

09:49.914 --> 09:56.258
But this is still gonna be
the most beautiful,

09:56.259 --> 10:00.603
deep, real,

10:00.604 --> 10:04.396
cool and hot, meaningful,

10:04.397 --> 10:06.430
important relationship of my life.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.017
Me, too.

10:09.018 --> 10:10.879
I've never felt so cool.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.223
I've never felt so cool.

10:13.224 --> 10:15.844
Really... not... not as cool as
when I'm with you.

10:15.845 --> 10:17.948
Me, neither.

10:17.949 --> 10:21.637
Abbi?

10:21.638 --> 10:23.913
I don't think I can go to
this dinner tonight.

10:23.914 --> 10:27.913
I just... I can't say goodbye
again, you know?

10:27.914 --> 10:30.223
This is... This is too perfect.

10:30.224 --> 10:31.794
Wait, Ilana, no.

10:31.805 --> 10:34.534
We were gonna splurge and get,
like, the whole bottle of wine.

10:34.535 --> 10:36.741
I know, but...

10:36.742 --> 10:39.085
I can't do it. I'm really sorry.

10:39.086 --> 10:41.810
You know what? You take the Wa-Unchi.

10:41.811 --> 10:44.706
You'll be the envy of your whole dorm.

10:44.707 --> 10:46.017
It's not a dorm.

10:46.018 --> 10:47.018
Goodbye.

10:47.019 --> 10:49.396
Wait.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.891
Meet you in St. Louis!

11:11.259 --> 11:12.949
What the fuck?

11:14.684 --> 11:17.856
Hey, Bevers!

11:17.857 --> 11:19.890
I got us food!

11:49.374 --> 11:50.718
Hey!

11:50.719 --> 11:52.235
Abbi, thank God you picked up.

11:52.236 --> 11:53.649
I fell asleep.

11:53.650 --> 11:55.580
I was sunbathing nude on the roof again.

11:55.581 --> 11:58.235
You... you were?

11:58.236 --> 12:00.476
Yeah, anyway, the door locked behind me.

12:00.477 --> 12:02.407
Can you come up and bring my kimono?

12:02.408 --> 12:04.718
I'm extremely sunburned.

12:04.719 --> 12:06.407
Everywhere.

12:06.408 --> 12:09.304
All right, Bevers, uh, you know,
cover yourself up.

12:09.305 --> 12:11.028
I don't want to see
your sunburned penis.

12:11.029 --> 12:12.925
Open your eyes.

12:12.926 --> 12:14.235
No.

12:14.236 --> 12:16.614
It's kosher, dude. Open 'em up.

12:16.615 --> 12:19.442
Surprise!

12:19.443 --> 12:20.856
What?!

12:20.857 --> 12:22.545
Wait. What, Ilana?

12:22.546 --> 12:25.097
Oh, my God.

12:25.098 --> 12:29.580
Come on. My girl got to have
a proper, royal queen send-off.

12:31.029 --> 12:32.787
And sorry about the bridge before.

12:32.788 --> 12:35.476
I was very much processing this
all at once.

12:35.477 --> 12:37.649
But then also, I had to leave to
set this up, so...

12:37.650 --> 12:41.373
Well, this is the cutest thing
I have ever seen,

12:41.374 --> 12:43.235
but I have to change.

12:43.236 --> 12:44.752
Yeah, of course. Of course.

12:44.753 --> 12:47.028
Guys, Abbi and I are gonna
go downstairs!

12:47.029 --> 12:49.131
All right!

12:53.719 --> 12:55.511
Abbi and I are back, you guys!

12:55.512 --> 12:57.269
Hey!

12:57.270 --> 12:59.476
My God. Trey!

12:59.477 --> 13:02.200
Batter up! Trey!

13:02.201 --> 13:03.338
Geez.

13:03.339 --> 13:04.856
- Hi.
- It's so good to see you.

13:04.857 --> 13:07.263
- Yeah. I'm really happy to see you.
- Oh.

13:07.274 --> 13:10.511
Oh, I got you something.

13:10.512 --> 13:12.097
They're free weights.

13:12.098 --> 13:14.062
What? Thank you so much.

13:14.063 --> 13:16.338
I'll... I'll try to
put it on my carry-on.

13:16.339 --> 13:17.959
- Cool, yeah.
- All right.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.959
- Ooh, you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got...

13:19.960 --> 13:22.269
Okay. I've always said, Abbi
and incremental free weights,

13:22.270 --> 13:24.442
- match made in heaven.
- Yeah.

13:24.443 --> 13:26.097
You're really special to me, Abbi.

13:26.098 --> 13:28.959
You're really special to me, too.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.718
Well, then, I guess it's now or never.

13:31.719 --> 13:36.925
Abbi Gary Anna Abrams,
will you marry me?

13:36.926 --> 13:40.476
Um... oh, Trey.

13:40.477 --> 13:42.200
Two carats.

13:42.201 --> 13:43.856
No. Right?

13:43.857 --> 13:46.442
Right, yeah, no.

13:46.443 --> 13:47.856
Yeah, no.

13:47.857 --> 13:49.269
- You know.
- You know what?

13:49.270 --> 13:51.028
- It was a big swing.
- No, no, no.

13:51.029 --> 13:53.511
I just figured, this is
my last chance, you know, so...

13:53.512 --> 13:55.097
It's cool.

13:55.098 --> 13:57.373
Maria... Cut the video, okay? Delete it.

13:57.374 --> 13:59.511
She said no.

13:59.512 --> 14:01.683
Okay, well, I should probably go

14:01.684 --> 14:03.338
'cause you said no to my proposal,

14:03.339 --> 14:06.580
but promise me you'll eat
for your blood type, okay?

14:06.581 --> 14:07.683
- Okay.
- Yeah.

14:07.684 --> 14:09.043
Done. Here you go.

14:09.054 --> 14:10.442
- All right.
- Oh, you want that?

14:10.443 --> 14:12.905
Thank you so much. All right, beefcake.
You've had enough time

14:12.916 --> 14:14.722
to show off your rock-hard tits
and your Adonis ass.

14:14.733 --> 14:16.614
It's time to leave and exit, dawg.

14:16.615 --> 14:17.856
Okay, I was just saying goodbye.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.269
And I took off work for this.

14:19.270 --> 14:21.166
You did? That sucks.
You know what else sucks?

14:21.167 --> 14:22.614
When your best friend moves away,

14:22.615 --> 14:24.279
and everybody's out for
face time for her.

14:24.290 --> 14:26.235
Get out of here!
But maybe we'll be friends.

14:26.236 --> 14:28.476
I don't have any left.

14:32.684 --> 14:35.442
- Hey!
- Ohh.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.407
I'm sorry.

14:40.408 --> 14:41.718
I'm gonna miss you.

14:41.719 --> 14:43.166
I'm gonna miss you, too, Linc.

14:43.167 --> 14:45.028
How's Ilana doing?
I haven't talked to her yet.

14:45.029 --> 14:48.821
Um, yeah. Ilana is, uh...

14:48.822 --> 14:50.545
Aww.

14:50.546 --> 14:52.407
You know what? Ilana's gonna be great.

14:52.408 --> 14:53.614
Yeah, I'ma check it.

14:53.615 --> 14:54.855
Okay. All right.

14:54.866 --> 14:56.131
- See you later.
- I'll catch you.

14:56.132 --> 14:57.407
Enough. Get out of here.

14:57.408 --> 14:59.442
Go, go!

14:59.443 --> 15:01.269
Are you Abbi's friend?

15:01.270 --> 15:02.959
Hey.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.618
Hi.

15:04.629 --> 15:05.835
Thank you for inviting me.

15:05.846 --> 15:07.191
Yeah, you're welcome.

15:07.202 --> 15:09.881
- You're Abbi's friend, too, you know?
- Yeah.

15:09.892 --> 15:12.338
We're no longer dating, right?

15:12.339 --> 15:14.442
And, uh, we're gonna keep growing

15:14.443 --> 15:17.442
our real, yet platonic friendship.

15:17.443 --> 15:20.649
- And that means honesty.
- Yeah.

15:20.650 --> 15:25.028
So, um, I'm gonna be honest with you.

15:25.029 --> 15:27.062
You got to get the fuck out of here.

15:27.063 --> 15:28.476
- What?
- Yeah, it's time to go.

15:28.477 --> 15:30.291
- Yeah.
- I heard about grad school.

15:30.302 --> 15:32.062
Jaimé told me.
I wanted to congratulate you.

15:32.063 --> 15:33.649
Yeah, you're a good guy. We all know it.

15:33.650 --> 15:35.131
- You're gonna be a great...
- Go, go!

15:35.132 --> 15:37.614
Whoo-hoo! Party's over, bitch.

15:37.615 --> 15:40.131
You know, I know it's scary,
you know, moving away.

15:40.132 --> 15:41.580
But it's good to remind ourselves

15:41.581 --> 15:43.580
that there's other places
besides New York City.

15:43.581 --> 15:45.614
Beautiful places.

15:45.615 --> 15:47.649
And New Jersey.

15:47.650 --> 15:49.062
It's gonna be great.

15:49.063 --> 15:50.407
- Yeah.
- 'Sup?

15:50.408 --> 15:51.408
- Okay!
- Jesus!

15:51.409 --> 15:52.614
- Well...
- Hi.

15:52.615 --> 15:53.994
Hi.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.511
So, Ilana, who are all these people?

15:55.512 --> 15:58.787
They're people from your building. I
just needed to fill the party out.

16:00.132 --> 16:03.304
Can't wait for brunch next weekend.
Jersey City is pretty damn lit.

16:03.305 --> 16:05.649
Mm-hmm. Yes, it is.

16:05.650 --> 16:07.082
Go now, though.

16:07.093 --> 16:09.166
- What?
- Like, to...

16:09.167 --> 16:10.890
To leave. To exit and leave.

16:10.891 --> 16:13.235
- Good to see ya, Jersey Boy. Love ya!
- I'm sorry.

16:16.512 --> 16:18.890
Hi, guys. Thank you so much for coming.

16:18.891 --> 16:20.821
You can leave. Come on, go.

16:20.822 --> 16:23.373
Okay. So the exit is that way.

16:23.374 --> 16:24.442
Get out of here!

16:24.443 --> 16:25.649
Bye!

16:25.650 --> 16:28.166
Yeah. Yeah.

16:33.753 --> 16:35.959
Okay, I'm almost here. I'm almost here.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.028
Now we can connect.

16:38.029 --> 16:40.476
Right.

16:40.477 --> 16:44.511
Well, I'm gonna stay
at my own place tonight.

16:44.512 --> 16:47.616
Gonna give you two broads some privacy.

16:47.627 --> 16:49.821
And I have a present for you.

16:49.822 --> 16:51.373
You didn't have to get me anything.

16:51.374 --> 16:54.028
Oh, well, it's just...

16:54.029 --> 16:57.476
So you can store your cheese in here.

16:57.477 --> 17:00.442
Everyone will know whose cheese it is,

17:00.443 --> 17:03.373
and they won't be able to
take it from you anymore.

17:03.374 --> 17:05.200
Thank you, Bevers.

17:08.768 --> 17:10.526
Yeah.

17:11.063 --> 17:12.959
I... I love it.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.373
It's perfect.

17:14.374 --> 17:15.890
And we'll see each other again.

17:16.961 --> 17:17.961
Yeah.

17:17.972 --> 17:19.317
All right.

17:19.328 --> 17:21.259
Brunch at Felix tomorrow at 2:00.

17:21.270 --> 17:24.730
And then a movie. My choice.
Clear your schedule, bitch.

17:33.038 --> 17:34.694
Thanks for the party.

17:35.383 --> 17:37.601
My pleasure.

17:38.538 --> 17:39.890
Ready?

17:39.891 --> 17:41.649
Disney. Go.

17:41.650 --> 17:44.131
Euro-loving Aryan Nation pre-teen porn.

17:44.132 --> 17:46.580
Walt Disney was, like, um,
jizzing, basically,

17:46.581 --> 17:48.476
for rich Euros and feudal lords,

17:48.477 --> 17:51.752
and Mickey Mouse was supposed to
represent a dirty little Jew.

17:51.753 --> 17:53.442
Straight up.

17:53.443 --> 17:55.338
He was, like, on the ship,
you know what I mean?

17:55.339 --> 17:57.872
Like... He was, like, a plotting
and scheming dirty little Jew,

17:57.883 --> 18:00.959
which I love to plot and scheme,
so I'm, like, you got me, Walt.

18:03.857 --> 18:05.925
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

18:05.926 --> 18:07.269
Who do I want? Who do I want?

18:07.270 --> 18:08.649
I... I know.

18:08.650 --> 18:10.787
Ready? From inside the mouth.

18:10.788 --> 18:14.097
Ohh, the Kennedys.

18:14.098 --> 18:15.787
Ooh, thank you. The Kennedys.

18:15.788 --> 18:17.505
Obviously, first of all, sex addicts.

18:17.516 --> 18:19.392
Second of all, they killed
Marilyn Monroe.

18:19.403 --> 18:22.511
Wait, hold on. I thought Marilyn
Monroe died of a drug overdose.

18:24.367 --> 18:26.545
The government killed her
because she knew too much.

18:26.546 --> 18:28.718
Like, she just knew stuff about...

18:28.719 --> 18:31.925
Yeah, she knew about their bodies.
She knew about their policies.

18:31.926 --> 18:33.304
Like, where did you hear that?

18:33.305 --> 18:36.491
I will double check, but, um...

18:37.015 --> 18:38.649
It's widely known.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.028
It's widely known.

18:40.029 --> 18:41.555
All right.

18:41.566 --> 18:44.237
Well, these are gonna come in
handy for when I'm lonely.

18:44.995 --> 18:46.822
Okay, another one.

18:49.201 --> 18:50.269
What's up?

18:50.270 --> 18:52.236
- The post office.
- Oof.

18:52.247 --> 18:55.501
Okay, so the way that the post
office controls women is...

19:55.973 --> 19:59.145
Abbi? Abbi, Abbi, are you insane?

19:59.156 --> 20:00.708
You... you weren't gonna wake me up?

20:00.719 --> 20:03.511
Are you psychotic? You were gonna
leave without saying goodbye?

20:03.512 --> 20:04.994
I'm sorry, dude.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.925
We said goodbye a million times. I-I
didn't know how to do this one.

20:07.926 --> 20:09.545
Yeah, but I got you something.

20:09.546 --> 20:11.683
It's a go bag.

20:11.684 --> 20:14.442
The apocalypse will happen,

20:14.443 --> 20:16.890
and I will meet you in St. Louis.

20:16.891 --> 20:18.581
Right, okay.

20:28.742 --> 20:30.302
I'm so proud of you.

20:30.891 --> 20:32.856
I'm so proud of you, too, dude.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.166
Really, you are, like...

20:34.167 --> 20:36.752
You're the smartest person I know.

20:36.753 --> 20:38.235
Really.

20:38.236 --> 20:39.511
Yeah, are you kidding me?

20:39.512 --> 20:41.718
I'm, like, the only person you know.

20:43.167 --> 20:44.959
For real, though, Ilana. You, like...

20:44.960 --> 20:47.338
You're gonna kill it. I'm so excited.

20:47.339 --> 20:50.062
For everything for you.

20:50.063 --> 20:51.890
You've got so much.

20:51.891 --> 20:54.959
So much inside of you.

20:56.719 --> 20:58.821
You have so much to give.

20:58.822 --> 21:02.062
So much all wrapped up.

21:02.063 --> 21:04.511
And you're just letting it unroll.

21:04.512 --> 21:06.925
I mean, I don't even feel like

21:06.926 --> 21:08.649
I was, like, alive before I met you.

21:08.650 --> 21:10.269
You, like, taught me...

21:10.270 --> 21:11.821
Taught me how to do it, dude.

21:13.339 --> 21:15.925
Well, you're alive as hell now.

21:15.926 --> 21:19.097
This is really brave,
and it's the right thing.

21:19.098 --> 21:21.338
I wouldn't have been able
to do it without you.

21:22.995 --> 21:24.509
Come on, you dumb broads!

21:24.520 --> 21:26.683
I'm saying goodbye to my
best friend, you fucking fuck.

21:26.684 --> 21:28.407
This is a once-in-a-lifetime,
emotional moment

21:28.408 --> 21:30.028
with my soul sister, you rank rat whore!

21:30.039 --> 21:31.384
See if I tip you!

21:32.604 --> 21:34.604
You're just so beautiful
from the inside out.

21:34.615 --> 21:37.235
No, dude, you are, really.

21:37.236 --> 21:38.649
Okay. Go.

21:38.650 --> 21:40.235
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Okay.

21:40.236 --> 21:43.270
You got this. You got this.

21:45.891 --> 21:47.614
Okay.

21:47.615 --> 21:49.718
- Okay.
- Bye.

21:59.719 --> 22:01.338
Okay.

22:01.339 --> 22:03.132
I love you.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.545
No!

22:16.546 --> 22:20.821
Jesus, come on!

22:20.822 --> 22:22.858
Fuck!

22:24.342 --> 22:26.733
_

22:30.664 --> 22:32.007
Wow.

22:33.664 --> 22:35.594
Oh, my God.

22:35.595 --> 22:37.904
Yes!

22:37.905 --> 22:40.766
Freaking jackpot.

22:42.077 --> 22:43.214
Ew.

22:54.181 --> 22:55.318
Eww, dude!

22:55.319 --> 22:56.732
Insane.

22:56.733 --> 22:58.869
Walking it? Disgusting.

22:58.870 --> 23:00.766
Well, thank you
for keeping me up to date

23:00.767 --> 23:02.594
on all of New York's
most current events.

23:02.595 --> 23:03.938
Yeah.

23:03.939 --> 23:05.283
How have you been?

23:05.284 --> 23:08.145
Well, since last night, I went to sleep,

23:08.146 --> 23:10.732
and then I woke up, and then
I went to the coffee shop.

23:10.733 --> 23:13.283
- My coffee shop.
- Cute, cute.

23:13.284 --> 23:15.594
I also went to sleep and woke up,

23:15.595 --> 23:17.215
so we are on the same schedule.

23:17.226 --> 23:18.767
Ew, you know what happened to me today?

23:18.778 --> 23:20.525
I bumped into this girl,
and I was, like, "Sorry."

23:20.526 --> 23:22.421
And she was, like, "You're fine."

23:22.422 --> 23:23.835
Ew. "You're fine"?

23:23.836 --> 23:25.318
- Fuck her.
- Right?

23:25.319 --> 23:27.421
I'm, like, I know I'm fine, at least.

23:27.422 --> 23:28.835
Just say, "It's okay."

23:28.836 --> 23:30.618
I mean, that's not even
part of my vocabulary.

23:30.629 --> 23:32.938
You have to be, like, trained
for that to be a response.

23:32.939 --> 23:35.199
That's right. Don't tell me
my value 'cause you know what?

23:35.210 --> 23:36.938
I'm actually foiiine.

23:36.939 --> 23:38.938
- Oh, you foiiine, baby.
- You, too.

23:38.939 --> 23:40.352
All right, listen. I got to go.

23:40.353 --> 23:42.283
Uh, I'll call you when
I leave the studio, okay?

23:42.284 --> 23:43.766
Ooh, the studio? Okay.

23:43.767 --> 23:44.835
Love you, baby.

23:44.836 --> 23:47.181
All right. Love you, too.

24:05.181 --> 24:08.559
Dude, I am so excited to fucking
deejay this bat mitzvah tonight.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.318
Rich children, like,
legit know how to party.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.766
But honestly, like, what is deejaying?

24:13.767 --> 24:15.318
I think it's just a playlist, right?

24:15.319 --> 24:16.525
Yeah, but, like, with a table.

24:16.526 --> 24:17.697
You dropped these.

24:17.698 --> 24:19.732
Oh, my God. Thanks.

24:19.733 --> 24:22.214
Okay, so who were those guys

24:22.215 --> 24:24.490
we ended up playing pool with
on the roof last night?

24:24.491 --> 24:26.478
I don't know. I think one of
them played for the Knicks.

24:33.215 --> 24:36.180
Wow. Did you just make change
with a homeless guy?

24:36.181 --> 24:38.318
First of all, it's a man without a home.

24:38.319 --> 24:40.973
Second, we gonna act like he
ain't got no small bills?

The information inside
your brain is just vast.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.863
Vast and then also, there's nothing.

25:04.864 --> 25:06.449
Yeah, but good nothing.

25:06.450 --> 25:08.690
You're, like, just smart,
you know what I mean?

25:08.691 --> 25:10.966
- Am I, though?
- Yes, you're so smart.

25:10.967 --> 25:12.311
