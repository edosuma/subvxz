WEBVTT

02:10.758 --> 02:14.265
You know my mom was only
17 years older than me?

02:15.829 --> 02:18.731
We'll get through this, River.

02:18.766 --> 02:20.370
Together.

02:26.510 --> 02:30.545
I don't know what I
would do without you, Amanda.

02:30.580 --> 02:32.811
You'd figure it out.

02:45.364 --> 02:48.728
Not even in death
did he show up.

02:48.763 --> 02:50.730
Did you really expect him to?

02:53.735 --> 02:57.308
I don't know.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.772
What would you tell
your dad if he were here?

03:05.780 --> 03:07.714
He's dead to me.

03:11.984 --> 03:14.622
I wish we meant more to you.

03:53.762 --> 03:57.335
Baby, do you know
how much I love you?

03:58.932 --> 04:00.668
I love you too, Mom.

04:02.804 --> 04:07.312
Don't worry, I'll be back soon.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.710
You are special, River.

04:12.583 --> 04:14.385
Should I be concerned?

04:16.917 --> 04:20.325
My little baby's leaving is all.

04:20.360 --> 04:24.560
And I know you have to, babe,

04:24.595 --> 04:26.056
and I'm proud of you

04:26.091 --> 04:29.532
for taking ownership
of your life.

04:29.567 --> 04:32.568
Well, I know you're happy
I'm not taking Jamie with me.

04:32.603 --> 04:36.000
Mm, a little of that too.

04:36.035 --> 04:37.771
Hey,

04:37.806 --> 04:40.444
I just want you
to live a full life.

04:43.042 --> 04:47.715
Don't be like me.

04:47.750 --> 04:50.916
What do you mean?

04:50.951 --> 04:53.655
I love you.

04:53.690 --> 04:57.494
I love you.

04:57.529 --> 04:59.727
I'm gonna miss you.

04:59.762 --> 05:01.762
Not more than
I'm gonna miss you.

05:03.667 --> 05:05.865
And you're gonna be all right.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.636
Yeah.

05:09.607 --> 05:12.410
Hey, look at me.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.874
Just be strong.

05:14.909 --> 05:16.106
I will.

05:16.141 --> 05:17.107
-For you.
-For you.

05:17.142 --> 05:19.978
I know, I know.

05:20.013 --> 05:21.848
Always.

05:21.883 --> 05:24.114
My River.

05:26.052 --> 05:29.559
I feel so empty.

05:42.805 --> 05:44.838
It's okay to not be okay.

05:46.171 --> 05:47.808
You can grieve.

05:51.814 --> 05:55.486
I don't know how
to move past this.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.147
You don't have to.

06:01.593 --> 06:02.988
How can I move

06:03.023 --> 06:05.496
all her stuff into boxes?

06:10.536 --> 06:13.504
Just take it day by day, okay?

06:25.012 --> 06:28.717
I think you should
live somewhere else, Riv.

06:28.752 --> 06:30.521
Where would I move?

06:42.062 --> 06:45.932
This is North Carolina.

06:45.967 --> 06:48.902
Everywhere I go,

06:48.937 --> 06:51.674
it gives me memories.

06:51.709 --> 06:55.040
I saw that old tree house
we used to love is up for rent.

07:00.520 --> 07:04.214
I don't know, I don't know.

07:04.249 --> 07:07.855
Come on, Riv.

07:07.890 --> 07:10.462
The packing will be here
when you're ready.

07:12.664 --> 07:15.632
I'm not ready.

07:26.040 --> 07:31.516
but then again

07:37.590 --> 07:39.117
What am I even doing?

07:51.670 --> 07:54.638
Ugh, how great
does this energy feel?

07:54.673 --> 07:57.267
Come on, Riv, this is so you!

07:57.302 --> 07:59.808
I do feel some pressure lifted.

07:59.843 --> 08:02.107
But still, I don't know.

08:02.142 --> 08:03.515
Oh, no, you are at least

08:03.550 --> 08:05.550
looking at the place
before you say no.

08:05.585 --> 08:06.848
Please?

08:06.883 --> 08:08.784
-Okay.
-Come on!

08:15.562 --> 08:17.892
How could you not
love this place?

08:19.632 --> 08:22.534
It is magical.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.734
But?

08:27.002 --> 08:30.674
I just, I don't think I
need more change right now.

08:30.709 --> 08:32.577
You definitely do, Riv.

08:37.243 --> 08:38.814
Okay.

08:41.115 --> 08:44.050
I'm only doing this
because you're my best friend.

08:56.933 --> 09:00.968
You're doing
the right thing, Riv.

09:01.003 --> 09:04.807
Then, why do I feel so weird?

09:04.842 --> 09:06.644
Your mom just passed away.

09:06.679 --> 09:09.009
Just give yourself some time.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.886
Did you bite the picture?

09:17.921 --> 09:19.019
Who knows.

09:19.054 --> 09:21.252
That was definitely
your brother.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.631
Oh, yikes!

09:26.666 --> 09:28.127
You could use a new pair.

09:28.162 --> 09:31.328
Have you thought about
going back to the store yet?

09:31.363 --> 09:33.099
Not really thinking about it.

09:33.134 --> 09:34.804
Just I need to save money,

09:34.839 --> 09:37.708
and Michael,

09:37.743 --> 09:39.875
that poor man needs my help.

09:42.110 --> 09:43.846
It's about the only
job I can handle

09:43.881 --> 09:46.013
at this point, honestly.

09:46.048 --> 09:47.982
I get that.

09:48.017 --> 09:51.150
My family has offered
to help, you know?

09:53.022 --> 09:55.121
I know, and I love
you and your family,

09:55.156 --> 09:58.828
but I have to do this on my own.

09:58.863 --> 10:02.128
Mm, well, one day
you'll take our help.

10:02.163 --> 10:04.031
When have I ever
asked you for help?

10:04.066 --> 10:05.934
Hm, let's see,

10:05.969 --> 10:08.002
uh, there was that one
time in second grade,

10:08.037 --> 10:12.743
when you desperately
needed my Hello Kitty pencil.

10:16.375 --> 10:19.013
Don't even think about that.

10:26.121 --> 10:27.824
How is this real?

10:29.828 --> 10:32.664
This isn't how I
imagined coming back here.

11:05.963 --> 11:09.261
Well, I really miss
that sweet marmalade smell.

11:11.298 --> 11:13.034
It feels like home.

11:26.082 --> 11:28.115
I can do this.

11:47.268 --> 11:49.807
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:49.842 --> 11:51.270
Mm!

11:53.274 --> 11:55.373
I'm surprised you wanted
to come back to work so soon,

11:55.408 --> 11:58.178
but I'm glad you reached out.

11:58.213 --> 12:00.015
How are you doin', dear?

12:00.050 --> 12:02.182
I'm okay.

12:02.217 --> 12:04.789
And you need my help.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.857
I do, I do.

12:06.892 --> 12:10.289
Now, my office is always
open to you as well.

12:10.324 --> 12:13.798
I'm a therapist
first and foremost.

12:13.833 --> 12:14.966
I just,

12:15.001 --> 12:17.197
I don't think I'm ready
to talk about things yet.

12:17.232 --> 12:20.002
Of course.

12:20.037 --> 12:22.202
And you know how much
I appreciate you.

12:22.237 --> 12:26.877
I mean, those dinners
are so amazing.

12:26.912 --> 12:29.374
Your,

12:29.409 --> 12:33.081
you and your mother
will always be family to me.

12:33.116 --> 12:34.852
The day you came to this Earth

12:34.887 --> 12:37.019
was your mother's
proudest moment.

12:42.895 --> 12:46.061
We don't have to talk
about this right now, okay?

12:46.096 --> 12:47.425
Where should I start first?

12:47.460 --> 12:50.098
Well, all right,
let's take Mrs. McKenzie's jams

12:50.133 --> 12:52.100
and put 'em on
that wall over there.

12:52.135 --> 12:54.102
-Okay.
-All right.

13:06.083 --> 13:08.281
We'll do what
we can for her, Mama.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.895
I miss you too.

13:26.037 --> 13:28.972
River.

13:29.007 --> 13:32.041
Hey!

13:32.076 --> 13:34.879
-Ditching your brother already?
-What?

13:34.914 --> 13:36.947
I thought you were helping
him wedding plan today?

13:36.982 --> 13:39.411
Oh, yeah, you know how he is.

13:39.446 --> 13:40.610
Yeah, but,

13:40.645 --> 13:42.315
you know how Vanessa is.

13:42.350 --> 13:43.954
A lunatic.

13:49.555 --> 13:52.490
Are you all right?

13:52.525 --> 13:54.327
Yeah.

13:54.362 --> 13:56.230
I'm off in about 20 minutes.

13:56.265 --> 13:57.935
Okay.

14:00.973 --> 14:03.006
You thought about hiking yet?

14:04.537 --> 14:07.604
No, not yet.

14:07.639 --> 14:10.145
I think it would
be good for you.

14:10.180 --> 14:12.983
Yeah, me too,

14:13.018 --> 14:15.183
but you saw my old ones,

14:15.218 --> 14:18.417
and I just need to save up
money to buy new ones, so.

14:22.192 --> 14:23.125
Hey!

14:23.160 --> 14:24.555
That display looks great!

14:24.590 --> 14:25.655
Thank you!

14:25.690 --> 14:27.096
Do you need me to move anything?

14:27.131 --> 14:28.163
No, no need.

14:28.198 --> 14:28.897
Well, hey,

14:28.932 --> 14:30.594
-how you doin', Amanda?
-Hey.

14:30.629 --> 14:32.233
How's your brother's
wedding coming along?

14:32.268 --> 14:34.169
Is he gettin' the jitters yet?

14:34.204 --> 14:36.534
Uh, it's coming,
you know how he is.

14:36.569 --> 14:38.536
Well, I know that Jamie had
all the ladies chasin' him,

14:38.571 --> 14:40.142
that's for sure.

14:40.177 --> 14:42.045
You know,
I always thought you two

14:42.080 --> 14:45.048
would get back together, River.

14:45.083 --> 14:46.214
Well, some things are better

14:46.249 --> 14:48.216
-left in the past.
-Oh.

14:48.251 --> 14:49.646
Perhaps.

14:59.427 --> 15:02.659
Oh, God, he's getting married.

15:02.694 --> 15:05.068
Why am I thinking
about him right now?

15:07.072 --> 15:08.665
Should I reach out to him?

15:11.175 --> 15:13.142
Maybe I'll send a text?

15:16.213 --> 15:17.542
This is ridiculous.

15:21.383 --> 15:24.219
Oh, my God.

15:24.254 --> 15:25.715
Hey, baby,
I'm just leavin' practice.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.585
Um, I know you wanna
check out that movie,

15:27.620 --> 15:29.719
so I'm a come by and get you,

15:29.754 --> 15:32.689
and then, uh, we'll
have dinner and a movie.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.559
How could I walk away?

15:34.594 --> 15:37.463
River, please don't
cut me out of your life.

15:37.498 --> 15:38.695
I know how you
want to move to L.A.,

15:38.730 --> 15:40.433
but I know we can make it work.

15:40.468 --> 15:41.698
Riv, stop!

15:44.208 --> 15:45.735
Loved you my entire life.

15:45.770 --> 15:48.540
Jamie, please stop.

15:48.575 --> 15:49.673
We haven't been with anyone else

15:49.708 --> 15:52.610
to understand that
this is even real.

15:52.645 --> 15:54.051
Tell me,

15:54.086 --> 15:55.987
what's more real
than me and you?

15:59.190 --> 16:02.455
I've never left this small town

16:02.490 --> 16:04.094
and neither have you.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.460
You're makin' a mistake.

16:11.037 --> 16:14.071
Maybe,

16:14.106 --> 16:15.765
but I need this.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.602
My mom has never even left.

16:19.276 --> 16:21.441
I want more,
I can't explain it.

16:43.399 --> 16:46.268
Whatever, that's it.

16:46.303 --> 16:48.732
I'm calling him.

16:48.767 --> 16:51.042
Oh, God, but what if he answers?

16:53.178 --> 16:54.276
Ugh.

16:57.512 --> 16:59.809
Oh, no.

16:59.844 --> 17:01.745
And, defeated.

17:01.780 --> 17:05.089
Riv?

17:05.124 --> 17:08.092
Why do I do this to myself?

17:10.360 --> 17:12.393
I feel like such an idiot.

17:19.237 --> 17:20.599
River.

17:54.437 --> 17:56.734
Sorry!

17:56.769 --> 17:58.439
Hey!

17:58.474 --> 17:59.803
Hey.

18:04.381 --> 18:08.581
So, you comin' over later
to help me unpack?

18:08.616 --> 18:10.451
Um?

18:10.486 --> 18:11.419
What?

18:11.454 --> 18:15.522
Riv, we unpacked
all your stuff yesterday?

18:15.557 --> 18:19.526
-We did?
-Are you okay?

18:19.561 --> 18:21.660
Yeah, I'm just--ever--

18:21.695 --> 18:23.299
I'm just off.

18:23.334 --> 18:26.137
Then I'm glad I
stopped by to check on you.

18:26.172 --> 18:27.666
Oh, my God,
is that the real ti--

18:27.701 --> 18:30.471
Uh, yeah, 10:15.

18:30.506 --> 18:32.539
Oh, my God.

18:32.574 --> 18:34.673
Oh, I'm so late for work.

18:34.708 --> 18:36.279
Let's hang out later, okay?

18:36.314 --> 18:37.577
Okay.

18:37.612 --> 18:39.381
I have to be at the store
to get a package,

18:39.416 --> 18:42.285
-and I hope I've--
-Hey,

18:42.320 --> 18:44.716
deep breaths, okay?

18:44.751 --> 18:46.388
I'll just see you later.

19:05.607 --> 19:07.277
Welcome to Ruffin's Roost!

19:09.446 --> 19:10.676
Shit.

19:10.711 --> 19:13.679
This is not happening.

19:13.714 --> 19:15.318
Hey.

19:17.223 --> 19:19.916
Hey.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.522
Do you need something?

19:23.625 --> 19:24.756
Not really.

19:26.826 --> 19:30.663
How, how's wedding
planning going?

19:30.698 --> 19:32.302
It's goin'.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.963
You know, Vanessa's nice.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.569
Yeah, okay.

19:35.604 --> 19:36.867
I'm lucky to have Amanda,
you know how she is,

19:36.902 --> 19:39.738
she's way more
organized than I am.

19:39.773 --> 19:42.345
Yeah, your sister's the best.

19:44.448 --> 19:46.514
So, Vanessa?

19:46.549 --> 19:47.977
Here it comes,
I knew it was comin'.

19:48.012 --> 19:48.978
What?

19:49.013 --> 19:51.915
You know she's always
had a thing for you.

19:51.950 --> 19:54.456
You haven't changed.

19:54.491 --> 19:55.919
Did you expect me
to be that different?

19:55.954 --> 19:57.756
Well, a year's a long time.

20:00.794 --> 20:03.597
Yeah, well,

20:03.632 --> 20:04.961
I know you didn't come here

20:04.996 --> 20:08.239
to ask me to help you
plan your wedding.

20:08.274 --> 20:09.537
So, what is it?

20:11.904 --> 20:14.476
Just wanted to see you.

20:14.511 --> 20:15.741
Your mom.

20:20.781 --> 20:23.386
Well, you know how much your
family means to me and Amanda.

20:23.421 --> 20:24.651
Yeah, I know.

20:29.295 --> 20:31.724
For what it's worth,

20:31.759 --> 20:33.957
I'm sorry I didn't
come to the funeral.

20:33.992 --> 20:35.728
That was a dick move.

20:35.763 --> 20:37.268
Listen, I get it, okay?

20:37.303 --> 20:38.566
Riv, I had to let go
of a lot of friends.

20:38.601 --> 20:40.271
You gotta understand.

20:40.306 --> 20:42.504
Isn't that a red flag?

20:42.539 --> 20:43.670
What do you mean?

20:43.705 --> 20:45.276
To let go of all your friends

20:45.311 --> 20:47.806
and miss my mom's funeral
just because your fiancé

20:47.841 --> 20:49.907
doesn't want you around
his ex-girlfriend,

20:49.942 --> 20:53.284
who happens to be best
friends with his sister?

20:53.319 --> 20:55.847
And who grew up together?

20:55.882 --> 20:58.817
I know.

20:58.852 --> 21:00.621
Does she know you're here now?

21:04.726 --> 21:09.058
Jamie, what do you want?

21:09.093 --> 21:10.499
Amanda told me everything,

21:10.534 --> 21:13.766
and I know you're sorry.

21:13.801 --> 21:15.405
I got your letters.

21:18.806 --> 21:19.937
You called.

21:22.810 --> 21:24.975
Honestly,

21:25.010 --> 21:27.010
I didn't expect to see
your name pop up.

21:29.421 --> 21:33.082
River, you're my entire
childhood and 20s.

21:33.117 --> 21:34.886
So when you called, of course
you know I'd pick up.

21:34.921 --> 21:38.560
I can't talk about this
right now, Jamie.

21:38.595 --> 21:41.695
I see some things
haven't changed.

21:41.730 --> 21:43.664
Please stop.

21:43.699 --> 21:46.898
I went to Los Angeles,
and you chose to stay.

21:46.933 --> 21:48.603
That,

21:48.638 --> 21:52.002
that's not how I
remember things at all.

21:52.037 --> 21:53.674
You didn't want me to go.

22:03.950 --> 22:05.048
Jamie?

22:07.657 --> 22:08.356
What are you doing?

22:08.391 --> 22:09.558
I told you this isn't the time

22:09.593 --> 22:10.790
or place to talk to her.

22:10.825 --> 22:12.858
She called me first.

22:12.893 --> 22:14.959
Why did you call him?

22:14.994 --> 22:16.631
Okay, even if she did
call you first,

22:16.666 --> 22:18.930
did you really think now would
be a good time to hash this out?

22:18.965 --> 22:20.096
It's not like I meant
for this to happen.

22:20.131 --> 22:21.405
And what did you
think would happen

22:21.440 --> 22:22.406
when you came here?

22:22.441 --> 22:23.506
I shouldn't have called.

22:23.541 --> 22:25.035
Then, why did you?

22:25.070 --> 22:26.443
Everything is just off.

22:26.478 --> 22:28.676
Hm, all right.

22:28.711 --> 22:30.744
Well, I'm taking the rest
of the day off since you had me

22:30.779 --> 22:31.679
all day yesterday,

22:31.714 --> 22:33.615
and now I'm pissed.

22:33.650 --> 22:34.814
Yesterday?

22:34.849 --> 22:36.387
I texted you, you knew that.

22:36.422 --> 22:37.817
I can vouch for Amanda,
she was with me.

22:37.852 --> 22:40.721
Don't even speak, Jamie.

22:40.756 --> 22:41.855
Okay, guys,

22:41.891 --> 22:45.726
I have to get back to work,
as much fun as this is.

22:45.761 --> 22:47.464
-Can I see you later?
-Ugh,

22:47.499 --> 22:49.466
I taught you better
than that, brother.

22:49.501 --> 22:51.028
Last time I checked,
you're my younger sister.

22:51.063 --> 22:52.733
And still.

22:52.768 --> 22:55.538
Both of you, Michael's
gonna be back any minute, so.

22:55.573 --> 22:57.540
All right, let's go.

22:59.170 --> 23:01.940
Hey, Riv, this
conversation isn't over.

23:01.975 --> 23:04.140
Yes, it is!

23:04.175 --> 23:07.418
Amanda!

23:07.453 --> 23:09.684
Where was your car this morning?

23:09.719 --> 23:10.918
What do you mean?

23:10.954 --> 23:15.558
This morning when you stopped by
and scared the hell out of me.

23:15.593 --> 23:18.891
I was with Jamie
all morning, Riv.

23:18.926 --> 23:20.431
Are you okay?

23:20.466 --> 23:21.762
Yeah, I'm fine.

23:25.636 --> 23:28.769
Isn't Michael a therapist?

23:28.804 --> 23:31.640
What are you trying to say?

23:31.675 --> 23:33.675
I don't need help, Amanda!

23:33.710 --> 23:34.874
Just know we love you, Riv,

23:34.909 --> 23:36.513
and we're here for you.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.781
Why does everyone
keep telling me that?

23:44.655 --> 23:47.018
Amanda!

23:57.063 --> 24:00.867
Mom, why did you leave me?

24:00.902 --> 24:04.706
Why?

24:04.741 --> 24:05.938
You all right?

24:09.240 --> 24:11.845
I'm so sorry!

24:11.880 --> 24:14.716
You got nothing
to be sorry about.

24:14.751 --> 24:17.180
We're humans, not machines.

24:17.215 --> 24:18.753
It's good to let it out.

24:23.859 --> 24:27.223
-Thank you.
-For what?

24:29.568 --> 24:31.535
For allowing me to be human.

25:35.161 --> 25:36.325
Hey!

25:36.360 --> 25:38.096
Hey.

25:40.133 --> 25:43.134
-Thanks for coming over.
-Of course.

25:43.169 --> 25:46.676
Where should I start?

25:46.711 --> 25:48.579
I don't know.

25:48.614 --> 25:52.209
-I'm feeling like--
-Riv, I'm here.

26:03.827 --> 26:05.629
Amanda, do you
remember when we,

26:05.664 --> 26:06.993
when we went
white water rafting?

26:07.028 --> 26:07.961
With Jamie?

26:07.996 --> 26:10.194
And the raft guy kept
telling him to sit down.

26:10.229 --> 26:12.031
And we all flipped out.

26:12.066 --> 26:14.132
How could I forget?

26:14.167 --> 26:16.904
Your mom took us.

26:16.939 --> 26:20.171
Wish we still had
those pictures.

26:20.206 --> 26:22.778
Yeah.

26:22.813 --> 26:26.617
Wait, Amanda, we do.

26:26.652 --> 26:28.311
-The time capsule!
-The time capsule!

26:28.346 --> 26:29.950
Oh, my God, do you
think it's still there?

26:29.985 --> 26:31.347
It better be!

26:41.293 --> 26:42.765
Are you sure this was the spot?

26:42.800 --> 26:44.327
Yeah, I'm positive.

26:44.362 --> 26:46.967
We buried it by
this lonely wolf.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.873
It's really weird how much
she loved that thing.

26:54.306 --> 26:56.911
And this backyard.

26:56.946 --> 26:59.980
She loved you way more.

27:00.015 --> 27:02.752
How long ago did we
bury this thing anyway?

27:02.787 --> 27:04.083
Oh, I don't know.

27:04.118 --> 27:06.415
I think we were like
in fourth grade or something.

27:06.450 --> 27:08.252
-But we--
-How could I even forget?

27:08.287 --> 27:10.023
I never forgets these things.

27:10.058 --> 27:12.190
We definitely put stuff
in here over time though.

27:14.062 --> 27:16.898
I think this is it.

27:16.933 --> 27:18.900
Oh, my God.

27:18.935 --> 27:21.837
What?

27:21.872 --> 27:23.333
I remember that.

27:23.368 --> 27:26.336
-It was so long ago.
-It really was.

27:26.371 --> 27:28.371
And this,

27:28.406 --> 27:30.714
we definitely stole this.

27:30.749 --> 27:33.750
We stole so much from her.

27:33.785 --> 27:35.818
Mrs. McKenzie was crazy.

27:35.853 --> 27:37.116
What's this?

27:37.151 --> 27:39.382
Ugh, it looks like
Jamie's old bracelet.

27:39.417 --> 27:42.352
-I definitely did--
-That's most definitely mine.

27:42.387 --> 27:44.189
Don't remember inviting you.

27:44.224 --> 27:46.290
You know me, I invited myself.

27:46.325 --> 27:47.995
Figured you might need help.

27:48.030 --> 27:51.064
Is this okay with you, Riv?

27:51.099 --> 27:52.329
Yeah.

27:52.364 --> 27:55.002
I need all the help
I can get with packing.

27:55.037 --> 27:55.970
Said she wouldn't trip.

27:56.005 --> 27:58.775
How did you even know
about our time capsule?

27:58.810 --> 28:00.172
Read your diary.

28:00.207 --> 28:01.976
Even described this, uh,

28:02.011 --> 28:04.242
crusty-ass wolf.

28:04.277 --> 28:05.980
You didn't make it
hard to find, baby sis.

28:06.015 --> 28:06.714
Always having to put your

28:06.749 --> 28:08.950
-two cents in.
-You know me.

28:08.985 --> 28:11.986
You Banks are
notorious for that,

28:12.021 --> 28:14.351
and that's why I love you.

28:14.386 --> 28:16.122
Both of you.

28:16.157 --> 28:18.025
That includes you too,
if you didn't know.

28:18.060 --> 28:19.257
Whatever.

28:22.031 --> 28:24.768
What's this?

28:24.803 --> 28:26.363
Oh, um...

28:45.417 --> 28:48.187
Oh, shit.

28:48.222 --> 28:51.322
Nice try.

28:51.357 --> 28:55.128
What are you doin', babe?

28:55.163 --> 28:57.801
Are you gonna take him
to Los Angeles with you?

29:00.069 --> 29:03.367
You already told Amanda,
he's bound to find out.

29:03.402 --> 29:05.303
Better you tell him than her.

29:10.541 --> 29:12.211
Mm.

29:16.954 --> 29:20.318
My beautiful baby girl.

29:20.353 --> 29:22.089
I'm jealous!

29:22.124 --> 29:24.388
You, you have your
whole life ahead of you.

29:27.228 --> 29:29.558
Mom,

29:29.593 --> 29:32.066
what am I gonna do
when I get there?

29:32.101 --> 29:35.267
And am I even making
the right choice?

29:35.302 --> 29:39.436
Only you know
the answer to that.

29:39.471 --> 29:41.306
What are you
gonna do without me?

29:41.341 --> 29:44.078
Eh, you'll be back

29:44.113 --> 29:46.542
when the time is right.

29:46.577 --> 29:48.951
I just want you to live first.

29:48.986 --> 29:49.952
Live first?

29:49.987 --> 29:52.548
What does that even mean?

29:52.583 --> 29:56.860
Not growing old in the same
town you grew up in.

30:02.626 --> 30:05.968
-Mom, what's wrong?
-Hm?

30:06.003 --> 30:07.497
Nothing, baby.

30:14.044 --> 30:16.308
This is for you.

30:16.343 --> 30:19.883
You'll know when the time
is right to open it.

30:19.918 --> 30:21.313
"When the time is right?"

30:21.348 --> 30:22.919
Yes.

30:26.056 --> 30:27.253
Okay.

30:32.359 --> 30:34.997
My mom gave me this.

30:35.032 --> 30:38.561
It's, uh, just a letter.

30:38.596 --> 30:40.871
Just save it for
when you get home, okay?

30:44.107 --> 30:45.370
Just breathe.

31:49.304 --> 31:52.074
Thank you guys so much.

31:52.109 --> 31:54.241
I couldn't have done this
without you both.

31:54.276 --> 31:55.605
We've got your back.

31:55.640 --> 31:59.180
Although, Vanessa has been
blowing up your phone.

31:59.215 --> 32:01.479
I'm surprised the police
haven't shown up yet.

32:01.514 --> 32:04.416
I'm shocked, too, actually.

32:04.451 --> 32:06.418
Not really sure what
you're doin', brother.

32:06.453 --> 32:09.388
This is marriage
we're talkin' about.

32:09.423 --> 32:10.489
To be honest,

32:10.524 --> 32:13.326
sometimes I don't even
know what I'm doin'.

32:13.361 --> 32:16.626
Jamie, you didn't
do anything wrong.

32:16.661 --> 32:19.233
You just helped me out with
the toughest time of my life.

32:19.268 --> 32:22.731
I agree, but I'm not sure
she'll see it that way.

32:22.766 --> 32:26.273
Hey, Amanda, do me a favor
and change the subject.

32:26.308 --> 32:28.539
You can't run away
from this forever.

32:36.615 --> 32:38.318
I can't believe
we actually found it.

32:38.353 --> 32:39.550
I know!

32:39.585 --> 32:42.058
He actually showed up though.

32:44.227 --> 32:45.490
Hey, can I talk to you?

32:47.527 --> 32:50.429
-Oh, okay, I'm just gonna--Yeah.
-Just.

32:53.434 --> 32:57.568
So, thought we could finish our
discussion from the other day.

33:00.342 --> 33:03.310
No offense, but there's
nothing really to talk about.

33:03.345 --> 33:05.213
Really?

33:05.248 --> 33:06.544
So, why'd you call me?

33:08.548 --> 33:09.580
I don't know.

33:13.652 --> 33:15.091
All right.

33:17.458 --> 33:19.590
How 'bout this?

33:19.625 --> 33:21.790
What's this?

33:21.825 --> 33:23.792
It's for you.

33:23.827 --> 33:25.596
Figured you might
wanna get out more.

33:28.271 --> 33:29.765
Why are you doing this?

33:29.800 --> 33:32.042
Well, if you must know,

33:32.077 --> 33:33.604
I didn't, if it
makes you feel better.

33:33.639 --> 33:35.243
Michael gave 'em
to me as a gift

33:35.278 --> 33:36.343
to give to you.

33:38.611 --> 33:42.349
On a serious note,

33:42.384 --> 33:45.220
no one pities you.

33:45.255 --> 33:48.685
Like I said before,
we just care about you.

33:48.720 --> 33:50.654
You're my best friend,
too, you know?

33:50.689 --> 33:53.723
You can't lose that.

33:53.758 --> 33:58.662
Jamie, you're getting married.

33:58.697 --> 34:01.170
Think I proved
I'll always be here,

34:01.205 --> 34:02.567
even with Vanessa.

34:06.210 --> 34:09.178
I'm not sure what
you want me to say.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.773
Nothin'.

34:10.808 --> 34:13.776
Just wish things were
different, you know?

34:13.811 --> 34:15.646
-Yeah, me too.
-Really?

34:15.681 --> 34:19.353
-Yeah?
-Can I come back now?

34:19.388 --> 34:22.422
Yo, you got a really good talent
for ruining a perfect moment.

34:22.457 --> 34:23.390
Would I even be
your little sister

34:23.425 --> 34:25.128
-if I couldn't?
-Mm, I don't think so

34:25.163 --> 34:26.426
because this is
what you always do.

34:26.461 --> 34:27.658
You're lucky you're cute.

34:27.693 --> 34:29.330
So, we done?

35:41.305 --> 35:44.603
Nothing is
the same anymore, Mom.

35:44.638 --> 35:47.540
I'm here walking
our favorite trail

35:47.575 --> 35:49.377
alone,

35:49.412 --> 35:51.775
something we enjoyed
so much together...

35:54.978 --> 35:57.715
...now feels so empty.

36:06.462 --> 36:08.792
Is there something
I could have done?

36:08.827 --> 36:10.827
Could I have saved you?

36:10.862 --> 36:13.203
I should have never left.

36:13.238 --> 36:15.469
You gave me signs.

36:15.504 --> 36:17.207
Why did I not see?

36:21.477 --> 36:23.411
How do I move forward

36:23.446 --> 36:26.579
when everything seems so dark?

36:26.614 --> 36:29.879
You're not really gone, Mom.

36:29.914 --> 36:31.518
You can't be.

36:42.564 --> 36:45.664
I see the stars creeping
out right now, Mom.

36:45.699 --> 36:48.667
Our favorite thing was
to stargaze right here

36:48.702 --> 36:50.669
and point laser pens
at satellites,

36:50.704 --> 36:53.441
hoping it was something else.

36:53.476 --> 36:55.674
We never did get
that message back.

37:03.882 --> 37:06.256
You were my best friend,

37:06.291 --> 37:07.752
not just my mom.

38:38.482 --> 38:40.680
Yo, Riv, hit me up.

38:40.715 --> 38:42.110
I talked to Michael.

38:42.145 --> 38:43.551
I'm with Amanda,
we're lookin' for you.

38:43.586 --> 38:45.113
We haven't seen you in weeks.

38:45.148 --> 38:45.880
Thought you went on a hike,

38:45.916 --> 38:47.687
but we haven't heard from you.

38:47.722 --> 38:50.118
Please, hit me up ASAP.

38:54.828 --> 38:56.124
River, this isn't funny!

38:56.159 --> 38:57.532
Call me back.

38:57.567 --> 38:58.731
You missed your shift.

38:58.766 --> 39:00.964
Just wanna make sure
you're okay, honey.

39:00.999 --> 39:02.438
Give me a call.

39:59.860 --> 40:00.925
River?

40:05.030 --> 40:07.998
Amanda, I went on a hike, relax!

40:08.033 --> 40:08.933
What?

40:08.968 --> 40:09.800
It wasn't just a hike,

40:09.836 --> 40:10.935
-you've been--
-I can assure you,

40:10.970 --> 40:12.904
it was just that.

40:12.939 --> 40:14.169
River?

40:17.009 --> 40:19.647
How could you do this
to us, River?

40:19.682 --> 40:20.582
I don't--

40:20.617 --> 40:21.748
Where have you been?

40:21.783 --> 40:24.850
I went on a hike,
and it was yesterday.

40:24.885 --> 40:26.753
No!

40:26.788 --> 40:30.592
Jamie and I have been
hanging those in town

40:30.627 --> 40:32.187
for days.

40:32.222 --> 40:35.025
Riv, we've all called you
at least 100 times.

40:35.060 --> 40:37.962
We searched the woods,
your home, literally

40:37.997 --> 40:39.964
-everywhere you could think of.
-Well, I'm fine.

40:39.999 --> 40:43.473
I'm here, I'm fine, okay?

40:43.508 --> 40:45.134
When did you get home?

40:45.169 --> 40:48.874
I woke up in my bed
this morning.

40:48.909 --> 40:50.975
Well, I'm just glad you're back.

40:51.010 --> 40:51.877
Wait a minute,
what do you mean--

40:51.912 --> 40:53.912
Michael,

40:53.947 --> 40:55.980
come outside for a second?

40:56.015 --> 40:57.751
-Now?
-Now.

40:57.786 --> 41:00.149
-I'm stayin' here.
-No.

41:00.184 --> 41:01.788
You come too.

41:22.305 --> 41:23.942
We shouldn't push her right now.

41:23.977 --> 41:26.648
She's dealing with something
bigger than we imagined.

41:29.620 --> 41:31.620
We need to give her space.

41:33.624 --> 41:36.119
I'll call the sheriff
and let him know she's back.

41:41.093 --> 41:42.191
I'm driving you home.

41:42.226 --> 41:44.864
-I drove.
-Then I'm coming with you.

41:44.899 --> 41:45.898
Okay.

41:45.934 --> 41:49.099
Take a few days off,
then come back next week.

41:49.134 --> 41:51.640
-I'm comin' with y'all.
-No.

41:51.675 --> 41:53.235
You stay here.

41:53.270 --> 41:54.973
-Come on.
-Amanda.

42:06.250 --> 42:09.020
Riv? River?

42:30.010 --> 42:31.207
What the hell is that?

42:31.242 --> 42:33.077
The attorney put the sign up.

42:37.985 --> 42:39.688
Where is all of our stuff?

42:39.723 --> 42:41.217
Jamie and I took
some of it to storage

42:41.252 --> 42:42.823
before the banks moved in.

42:52.835 --> 42:56.232
Hey, hey.

42:56.267 --> 42:58.971
River, you listen to me.

42:59.006 --> 43:00.874
This is not you.

43:00.909 --> 43:03.910
You're my strong girl.

43:03.945 --> 43:06.649
Be strong, baby.

43:06.684 --> 43:11.346
-Mom?
-You can do this.

43:11.381 --> 43:12.721
River?

43:12.756 --> 43:14.217
River?

43:14.252 --> 43:15.823
River!

43:18.927 --> 43:21.191
Mom?

43:41.081 --> 43:44.115
Maybe you should shower.

43:44.150 --> 43:45.754
Do I smell?

43:45.789 --> 43:48.185
You have been gone.

43:48.220 --> 43:49.989
How can I help?

43:55.898 --> 43:57.799
Stop looking at me like that.

43:57.834 --> 43:59.328
What am I looking at you like?

44:02.707 --> 44:04.267
Like I'm crazy.

44:32.330 --> 44:35.265
Uh, I'm just.

44:35.300 --> 44:37.168
I'm just tired.

44:43.847 --> 44:46.177
Just,

44:46.212 --> 44:48.949
I do feel like I'm
going crazy sometimes.

44:53.450 --> 44:54.856
Amanda...

44:57.960 --> 45:01.258
...I don't remember
how I got home.

45:01.293 --> 45:03.161
You're not crazy.

45:27.418 --> 45:29.352
How is this happening?

45:41.003 --> 45:43.069
My whole body aches.

46:12.067 --> 46:13.363
Amanda.

46:20.438 --> 46:22.537
I'm going crazy.

46:22.572 --> 46:24.143
You're not.

46:29.282 --> 46:31.348
What's--what's happening to me?

46:32.516 --> 46:34.087
You're evolving.

46:39.259 --> 46:41.864
Try to bring
your heart rate down.

47:07.089 --> 47:08.550
That's enough for today.

47:10.521 --> 47:12.961
I'm so scared.

47:12.996 --> 47:14.424
I'm so scared.

48:30.535 --> 48:33.272
Hey. Dr. Glenn?

48:34.605 --> 48:36.209
It's River.

48:42.613 --> 48:44.448
I'm happy you're here.

48:44.483 --> 48:46.186
And I'm happy
you asked for help.

48:48.520 --> 48:51.059
Don't be nervous.

48:51.094 --> 48:53.490
I'm just here to listen to you

48:53.525 --> 48:56.592
and see what we can uncover
in your subconscious mind.

48:56.627 --> 48:57.560
Okay.

49:00.664 --> 49:03.368
You're gonna give me
medication, though,

49:03.403 --> 49:05.304
to help me through this, right?

49:05.339 --> 49:06.536
If you need it
to help you sleep,

49:06.571 --> 49:09.473
we'll see
after we have the session.

49:09.508 --> 49:11.145
You ready?

49:16.482 --> 49:17.745
Please tell me about the days

49:17.780 --> 49:20.220
leading up
to your mother's death.

49:25.359 --> 49:28.129
The last time I talked to her...

49:31.530 --> 49:34.267
Hey, look at me.

49:34.302 --> 49:35.730
Just be strong.

49:38.141 --> 49:39.437
I...

49:41.507 --> 49:44.607
I was in California, and...

49:48.118 --> 49:51.713
...that's--that's when
my mom called me.

49:51.748 --> 49:56.124
It's the last time
I talked to her.

49:56.159 --> 50:01.228
She--there was something
so wrong.

50:01.263 --> 50:03.692
I couldn't understand
anything she was saying.

50:03.727 --> 50:04.693
Mom.

50:05.795 --> 50:07.465
Mom!

50:07.500 --> 50:11.172
Wait, Mom, slow down!

50:11.207 --> 50:12.800
I can barely hear you!

50:14.507 --> 50:15.770
Mom!

50:17.576 --> 50:20.115
You're scaring me,
what's going on?

50:24.121 --> 50:26.088
Mom!

50:26.123 --> 50:28.354
I don't understand
what you're saying!

50:37.530 --> 50:40.069
The phone--the phone hung up

50:40.104 --> 50:42.401
and I got on the flight
the same day.

50:42.436 --> 50:47.637
That's when--that's when
the police called me

50:47.672 --> 50:51.245
and told me that
she was found dead

50:51.280 --> 50:53.115
in her bathtub.

50:55.251 --> 50:57.581
Can you describe the feelings
you were having?

51:01.488 --> 51:05.193
I was so angry, I was so angry.

51:05.228 --> 51:09.725
I--I know she didn't
kill herself.

51:11.564 --> 51:14.103
The report stated that she did.

51:24.148 --> 51:26.148
That's what the report stated.

52:05.783 --> 52:08.289
My mom didn't kill herself.

52:10.590 --> 52:13.723
I feel like someone's
controlling my body.

52:13.758 --> 52:16.165
It's a form of trauma, River.

52:16.200 --> 52:18.167
It's normal for people
to have feelings of guilt

52:18.202 --> 52:20.466
and out of body experiences.

52:22.239 --> 52:23.337
No.

52:23.372 --> 52:24.635
Make it go away!

52:24.670 --> 52:26.472
We're in the middle
of a session!

52:26.507 --> 52:28.276
Go wait in the lobby.

52:49.596 --> 52:51.497
Let's go fill this up.

52:51.532 --> 52:53.499
Bye, Dr. Glenn.

53:07.647 --> 53:10.483
How did you know where I was?

53:10.518 --> 53:12.683
Why did you go to the doctor's
without calling me?

53:12.718 --> 53:15.356
I asked you first.

53:15.391 --> 53:17.259
You weren't at work,
you weren't at home,

53:17.294 --> 53:19.360
so I assumed
you were at Dr. Glenn's.

53:20.858 --> 53:23.529
I can take care of myself.

53:23.564 --> 53:25.300
I know.

53:30.637 --> 53:34.276
You don't believe my mother
killed herself, do you?

53:34.311 --> 53:35.706
I don't know, Riv.

53:35.741 --> 53:37.807
We weren't there
to know what happened.

53:40.383 --> 53:43.450
Nothing makes any sense.

53:43.485 --> 53:46.750
This or me appearing
in the forest.

53:50.888 --> 53:53.262
The medication will help.

53:53.297 --> 53:54.890
Whatever happened to you
in the woods,

53:54.925 --> 53:56.529
this will help.

53:58.566 --> 54:00.632
You're not concerned?

54:03.802 --> 54:05.340
If Dr. Glenn said
you'll be okay,

54:05.375 --> 54:07.606
then you'll be okay.

54:07.641 --> 54:09.740
Yeah, but he didn't say
anything.

54:09.775 --> 54:12.347
He did to me.

54:12.382 --> 54:14.646
We're gonna fill this up
for you.

54:18.916 --> 54:22.291
What kind of feather is that?

54:22.326 --> 54:24.491
Looks like an owl's feather.

54:40.476 --> 54:42.641
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

54:44.414 --> 54:48.075
Hope is dwindling away
and things are happening to me

54:48.110 --> 54:50.583
that I can't explain.

54:59.121 --> 55:02.958
Maybe this will give me
some answers.

55:08.933 --> 55:12.066
My beautiful River,

55:12.101 --> 55:17.104
now you see I meant it
when I said you were special.

55:17.139 --> 55:22.384
And if you're reading this
and something's happened to me,

55:22.419 --> 55:25.046
I wish I could've
protected you from it.

55:25.081 --> 55:27.785
I wish I could've told you
from the start

55:27.820 --> 55:29.787
who you really are,

55:29.822 --> 55:34.561
why I always told you
you were special.

55:34.596 --> 55:37.366
Now you know.

55:37.401 --> 55:39.434
Don't be afraid, River.

55:39.469 --> 55:41.403
This is who you are,

55:41.438 --> 55:43.405
this is who you were
meant to be.

55:44.903 --> 55:48.036
Don't ever forget
how much I love you, baby.

55:48.071 --> 55:50.643
Be strong.

55:50.678 --> 55:52.843
I love you.

55:52.878 --> 55:55.648
Love, Mom.

56:11.963 --> 56:13.798
What does that even mean?

56:22.446 --> 56:25.843
I know you didn't kill yourself.

56:25.878 --> 56:27.515
I know it.

56:47.801 --> 56:49.669
So you just show back up.

56:51.068 --> 56:53.673
I didn't know I was missing.

56:53.708 --> 56:55.741
River, you know
that's a load of bullshit.

56:57.646 --> 57:00.108
You can't just do this
to everybody.

57:00.143 --> 57:02.715
I know you're going
through a lot right now,

57:02.750 --> 57:04.585
but if something would've
happened to you, I don't--

57:04.620 --> 57:06.554
What did Amanda tell you?

57:09.559 --> 57:12.989
Amanda didn't tell me anything.

57:13.024 --> 57:14.892
None of this makes sense.

57:16.764 --> 57:19.963
Tell me about it.

57:19.998 --> 57:22.669
I can't process this
myself either.

57:40.689 --> 57:42.755
Do you know
how much you mean to me?

57:46.255 --> 57:47.595
I did.

57:58.740 --> 58:00.135
I don't think you understand.

58:02.744 --> 58:05.910
You're the love of my life.

58:05.945 --> 58:09.650
When you moved to LA,
it was like a piece of me died.

58:12.281 --> 58:14.688
Until I thought
you were dead somewhere.

58:19.090 --> 58:21.189
You can't do this to me.

58:21.224 --> 58:23.158
I called off the wedding.

58:26.031 --> 58:26.997
No.

58:27.032 --> 58:28.570
I love you.

58:28.605 --> 58:30.539
I love you so much.

58:30.574 --> 58:33.102
I can't marry Vanessa
if I can't move on from you.

58:39.011 --> 58:41.946
We can do this together. Riv?

58:48.856 --> 58:50.284
Please talk to me.

58:50.319 --> 58:51.593
Riv?

58:54.697 --> 58:57.126
You know what to do now, River.

59:02.639 --> 59:04.969
I do?

59:05.004 --> 59:09.072
Baby, Jamie can't go with you.

59:09.107 --> 59:11.107
This is your journey.

59:13.243 --> 59:15.815
I understand.

59:15.850 --> 59:17.619
Good.

59:19.986 --> 59:21.656
Is this real?

59:45.110 --> 59:48.375
What did you do?

59:48.410 --> 59:50.751
I didn't do anything,
I thought she'd wake up.

59:50.786 --> 59:54.216
Does she look awake to you?

59:54.251 --> 59:58.220
God, you have no idea
what she's going through.

59:58.255 --> 1:00:00.024
And you do?

1:00:00.059 --> 1:00:02.158
I've been with her every day.

1:00:02.193 --> 1:00:05.128
And where were you
when her mom died?

1:00:05.163 --> 1:00:07.064
Amanda, you know
that's not fair.

1:00:08.367 --> 1:00:11.266
You really think she'll be
in a relationship with you now

1:00:11.301 --> 1:00:13.268
just 'cause you're single?

1:00:13.303 --> 1:00:14.709
Well, news flash,

1:00:14.744 --> 1:00:16.304
she's gone through
a lot of shit,

1:00:16.339 --> 1:00:18.042
and the last thing she needs
is you over here

1:00:18.077 --> 1:00:19.879
pining for her.

1:00:21.685 --> 1:00:24.147
Leaving her is not an option.

1:00:24.182 --> 1:00:26.017
I know.

1:00:30.023 --> 1:00:32.122
Why don't you keep me updated?

1:00:32.157 --> 1:00:33.893
I'm not your watcher.

1:00:33.928 --> 1:00:36.797
-No, just my sister.
-So?

1:00:41.232 --> 1:00:42.935
Girl, you've been
really acting off

1:00:42.970 --> 1:00:45.069
since River disappeared.

1:00:45.104 --> 1:00:47.841
You think you were
the only one panicking?

1:00:47.876 --> 1:00:49.744
Well, guess what, you weren't.

1:00:54.047 --> 1:00:56.883
The world doesn't revolve
around you, Jamie.

1:00:58.788 --> 1:01:02.856
You need to give her space
and leave now.

1:01:04.057 --> 1:01:05.320
Who do you think you are?

1:01:05.355 --> 1:01:07.795
I said leave.

1:01:14.837 --> 1:01:16.133
Fine.

1:01:18.236 --> 1:01:19.906
Be back later.

1:01:21.877 --> 1:01:23.470
Tell her that, all right?

1:01:23.505 --> 1:01:25.076
Maybe.

1:01:56.010 --> 1:01:57.471
Wake up, River.

1:02:03.919 --> 1:02:06.084
Amanda?

1:02:06.119 --> 1:02:08.218
You've been asleep
for a while now.

1:02:12.158 --> 1:02:13.993
I don't feel very good.

1:02:14.028 --> 1:02:16.028
Did you take your meds?

1:02:20.232 --> 1:02:21.968
Yeah.

1:02:22.003 --> 1:02:25.004
But something strange
is happening.

1:02:25.039 --> 1:02:26.500
I keep having these flashes,

1:02:26.535 --> 1:02:31.472
and every time I wake up,
I don't remember.

1:02:34.543 --> 1:02:37.379
The last time
I remember something,

1:02:37.414 --> 1:02:38.853
I was talking to Jamie,

1:02:38.888 --> 1:02:40.547
and then something hit me.

1:02:40.582 --> 1:02:42.890
It was like I was with my mom
and she told me that--

1:02:42.925 --> 1:02:45.486
What did Jamie have to say?

1:02:45.521 --> 1:02:47.125
Did you not hear
what I just said?

1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:48.555
Yes.

1:02:48.590 --> 1:02:51.030
Are you not concerned?

1:02:51.065 --> 1:02:52.460
I just think
you're experiencing

1:02:52.495 --> 1:02:54.561
a lot of trauma.

1:02:58.171 --> 1:03:01.172
I feel so lost.

1:03:01.207 --> 1:03:04.109
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1:03:04.144 --> 1:03:07.145
It's hard not to be.

1:03:07.180 --> 1:03:09.818
So what did Jamie have to say?

1:03:15.419 --> 1:03:18.090
What do you mean,
"What did Jamie have to say"?

1:03:19.489 --> 1:03:22.259
He adds no value
to your life, Riv.

1:03:22.294 --> 1:03:24.294
Value?

1:03:24.329 --> 1:03:25.428
Why would you say that?

1:03:25.464 --> 1:03:29.200
-Jamie has a lot of value.
-Of course, he has value,

1:03:29.235 --> 1:03:31.939
I just mean you went missing
for over a week

1:03:31.974 --> 1:03:34.238
and now you're back
like nothing's happened to you.

1:03:39.344 --> 1:03:42.378
I need to make--
I need to make an appointment

1:03:42.413 --> 1:03:43.610
with Dr. Glenn.

1:03:43.645 --> 1:03:45.546
I made one for you
while you were sleeping.

1:03:47.319 --> 1:03:49.924
I don't need you to mother me.

1:03:49.959 --> 1:03:51.860
It won't happen again.

1:04:00.970 --> 1:04:03.267
Where are my mom's letters?

1:04:03.302 --> 1:04:05.467
How would I know?

1:04:05.502 --> 1:04:07.634
They were right here,
I read them.

1:04:09.374 --> 1:04:11.407
When I came in,
you were sleeping.

1:04:15.149 --> 1:04:16.984
I'm sure I opened it.

1:04:25.192 --> 1:04:28.061
Just leave me alone.

1:04:28.096 --> 1:04:29.425
Your appointment's at 12.

1:05:12.734 --> 1:05:14.404
Hi, dear, come on in.

1:05:25.318 --> 1:05:27.252
So how are we doing today?

1:05:29.322 --> 1:05:31.124
I don't know.

1:05:31.159 --> 1:05:34.226
I'm not entirely sure.

1:05:34.261 --> 1:05:37.691
I keep seeing these images
and these scenes

1:05:37.726 --> 1:05:41.629
that play over and over
in my head.

1:05:41.664 --> 1:05:44.137
Well, that's trauma.

1:05:44.172 --> 1:05:46.568
Let's just give
the medication some time.

1:05:48.341 --> 1:05:50.176
Everything heals in time.

1:05:52.345 --> 1:05:55.478
Do you think
I'll ever be normal again?

1:05:55.513 --> 1:05:57.513
Come on.

1:05:57.548 --> 1:06:01.715
Honey, who knows
what normal is?

1:06:01.750 --> 1:06:04.091
Well, I found out
a few years ago

1:06:04.126 --> 1:06:06.555
that my blood type isn't normal.

1:06:06.590 --> 1:06:08.392
I'm Rh O negative.

1:06:08.427 --> 1:06:11.659
Oh, that is really
very rare indeed!

1:06:14.466 --> 1:06:17.698
I--I know this sounds
ridiculous,

1:06:17.733 --> 1:06:24.639
but I've been hearing owls
everywhere I go.

1:06:24.674 --> 1:06:26.113
Oh?

1:06:26.148 --> 1:06:27.214
That could have some meaning,

1:06:27.249 --> 1:06:29.743
maybe it's your mom trying
to give you a sign.

1:06:33.089 --> 1:06:34.484
Maybe.

1:06:34.519 --> 1:06:36.255
I don't know,
owls have always been

1:06:36.290 --> 1:06:38.521
some sort
of spirit animal to me.

1:06:38.556 --> 1:06:40.721
Ever since I was a little girl,

1:06:40.756 --> 1:06:43.493
I've seen owls everywhere I go.

1:06:43.528 --> 1:06:47.101
I mean, just--
just the other day,

1:06:47.136 --> 1:06:49.730
I was with Amanda,
and we found an owl feather

1:06:49.765 --> 1:06:51.501
on her windshield.

1:06:54.407 --> 1:06:56.110
Um...

1:06:58.444 --> 1:07:02.545
So, last night...

1:07:04.252 --> 1:07:08.287
...I--I opened a letter

1:07:08.322 --> 1:07:10.256
that my mom gave me.

1:07:12.656 --> 1:07:16.526
I put it in that time capsule
that Amanda and I...

1:07:18.827 --> 1:07:20.332
Go on.

1:07:24.272 --> 1:07:27.339
I don't know, it was...

1:07:27.374 --> 1:07:29.803
it wasn't anything monumental.

1:07:32.709 --> 1:07:34.841
Just really confusing.

1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:40.715
You know, sometimes,
when you try to find closure,

1:07:40.750 --> 1:07:42.420
it's not always
that easy to find.

1:07:42.455 --> 1:07:44.455
We might not truly find that.

1:07:48.857 --> 1:07:51.099
I'm gonna figure it out.

1:07:52.267 --> 1:07:54.399
Someone has to know something.

1:07:57.602 --> 1:08:01.109
Let's go back to these images.

1:08:01.144 --> 1:08:03.441
Tell me what you're seeing.

1:08:39.347 --> 1:08:41.182
I don't--I don't know.

1:08:43.879 --> 1:08:44.845
I don't know.

1:08:44.880 --> 1:08:46.715
I'm...

1:08:46.750 --> 1:08:48.519
I'm running from something.

1:08:52.723 --> 1:08:54.525
Nothing adds up.

1:08:54.560 --> 1:08:55.757
I don't know.

1:09:01.204 --> 1:09:03.897
I don't want to talk
about this anymore, okay?

1:09:03.932 --> 1:09:06.240
Okay.

1:09:06.275 --> 1:09:09.606
Let's see, well,
our time's up anyway.

1:09:09.641 --> 1:09:11.740
I'm sorry, I just...

1:09:13.876 --> 1:09:15.546
You know I don't talk, I just--

1:09:15.581 --> 1:09:18.285
I hate talking about this.

1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:19.715
I know.

1:09:19.750 --> 1:09:21.288
I do, I know.

1:09:21.323 --> 1:09:22.817
But you're doing it.

1:09:24.227 --> 1:09:28.229
Help me, Dr. Glenn.

1:09:28.264 --> 1:09:30.825
Do you think
I can come back to work yet?

1:09:30.860 --> 1:09:33.960
Yeah, if you feel up to it.

1:09:33.995 --> 1:09:36.963
Yeah, all right.

1:09:36.998 --> 1:09:41.242
Tomorrow at five, then, A.M.,
sharp, okay?

1:09:41.277 --> 1:09:43.508
Mopping floors
and scrubbing toilets.

1:10:16.675 --> 1:10:19.247
River.

1:11:00.455 --> 1:11:01.586
Riv?

1:11:04.921 --> 1:11:06.558
What are you doing?

1:11:10.091 --> 1:11:12.465
Why are you here?

1:11:12.500 --> 1:11:15.600
I was driving by
and saw your car.

1:11:15.635 --> 1:11:17.701
Then I saw you standing
in the damn street.

1:11:19.804 --> 1:11:22.442
You know, whatever's going on
with you, let me help.

1:11:27.449 --> 1:11:31.077
You sound like Amanda.

1:11:31.112 --> 1:11:33.079
I'm not sure you can.

1:11:33.114 --> 1:11:34.883
Amanda's acting off, too.

1:11:36.953 --> 1:11:39.360
So what am I supposed
to do here?

1:11:44.862 --> 1:11:48.061
Jamie, I think
we should just stop

1:11:48.096 --> 1:11:50.602
while we're ahead.

1:11:50.637 --> 1:11:52.406
Okay?

1:11:55.510 --> 1:11:57.070
You always do this.

1:12:01.010 --> 1:12:05.749
Listen, I'm not the same person
before my mom died,

1:12:05.784 --> 1:12:08.950
and I'm not the same person
before I went missing.

1:12:08.985 --> 1:12:12.558
You can't help me, Jamie!

1:12:12.593 --> 1:12:15.693
This is what's best for you.

1:12:15.728 --> 1:12:19.059
I'm so tired of you telling me
what's best for me

1:12:19.094 --> 1:12:21.765
when you are what's best for me
and you know it.

1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:23.866
Jamie, please.

1:12:29.412 --> 1:12:31.577
So this is what you want?

1:12:31.612 --> 1:12:34.107
This isn't what I want at all.

1:12:34.142 --> 1:12:37.880
For me to truly move on,
never look back?

1:12:39.983 --> 1:12:41.719
Yeah.

1:12:47.694 --> 1:12:49.089
Did you hear me?

1:12:51.665 --> 1:12:54.666
Yeah, I heard you.

1:12:57.572 --> 1:13:01.541
One day, you'll look back
at this moment

1:13:01.576 --> 1:13:03.609
and wish you had
a different answer.

1:13:03.644 --> 1:13:06.172
-Jamie.
-I hope you find your answer.

1:13:08.781 --> 1:13:10.550
It's all or nothing with you,
isn't it?

1:13:10.585 --> 1:13:12.552
Huh?

1:13:12.587 --> 1:13:14.653
We can't even be friends.

1:13:17.460 --> 1:13:19.625
I think you and I both know
that's not gonna work.

1:13:22.927 --> 1:13:24.828
You're cutting me
out of your life

1:13:24.863 --> 1:13:26.896
because I say
you can't be with me.

1:13:31.474 --> 1:13:35.443
You've been cutting me
out of your life for years.

1:13:35.478 --> 1:13:37.544
I was just too blind to see.

1:13:44.685 --> 1:13:46.520
Jamie.

1:14:40.070 --> 1:14:42.543
-Happy?
-Why would I be happy?

1:14:42.578 --> 1:14:44.237
You get her all to yourself,
that's what you wanted, right?

1:14:44.272 --> 1:14:47.009
What are you talking about?

1:14:47.044 --> 1:14:48.780
Don't play dumb, sis.

1:14:48.815 --> 1:14:52.850
You never had a boyfriend,
follow River all around.

1:14:52.885 --> 1:14:56.623
Yeah, I know
who you really are.

1:14:56.658 --> 1:14:59.758
Actually, I don't.

1:14:59.793 --> 1:15:01.188
I'm starting to think
you're a creeper.

1:15:01.223 --> 1:15:02.959
So where will you be going?

1:15:02.994 --> 1:15:04.697
Who said I was going anywhere?

1:15:04.732 --> 1:15:06.061
You and River are done for good,

1:15:06.096 --> 1:15:08.668
so where will you be moving now?

1:15:08.703 --> 1:15:10.230
I'm not leaving.

1:15:10.265 --> 1:15:12.001
Just as I thought.

1:15:12.036 --> 1:15:13.937
You are leaving, Jamie.

1:15:13.972 --> 1:15:17.105
You and Vanessa
are gonna work it out.

1:15:17.140 --> 1:15:19.844
Vanessa and I are done.

1:15:19.879 --> 1:15:23.144
That's what you think.

1:15:23.179 --> 1:15:24.783
Why are you smiling like that?

1:15:24.818 --> 1:15:26.587
Aren't you exhausted
from chasing someone

1:15:26.622 --> 1:15:28.952
who will never be with you?

1:15:31.022 --> 1:15:33.022
As far as I'm concerned,

1:15:33.057 --> 1:15:34.760
me and you are done, too.

1:15:34.795 --> 1:15:36.091
How about that?

1:15:40.262 --> 1:15:42.328
I have a feeling we're not.

1:16:10.292 --> 1:16:12.732
Michael!

1:16:12.767 --> 1:16:14.261
Dr. Glenn!

1:16:17.101 --> 1:16:18.804
Dr. Glenn!

1:16:21.842 --> 1:16:24.909
Sorry, we're closed.

1:16:24.944 --> 1:16:26.845
Are you okay?

1:16:29.410 --> 1:16:31.652
Michael, it's me.

1:16:31.687 --> 1:16:33.786
It's River.

1:16:33.821 --> 1:16:35.150
River?

1:16:36.956 --> 1:16:39.726
What's wrong?

1:16:39.761 --> 1:16:43.829
Nothing, I'm just tired today.

1:16:43.864 --> 1:16:45.061
I'll work the store
for you today,

1:16:45.096 --> 1:16:45.995
you can go home and rest.

1:16:46.031 --> 1:16:50.363
I--I was so hard
on you earlier, I'm...

1:16:50.398 --> 1:16:54.334
No, I think
we could be closed for a day.

1:16:55.777 --> 1:16:58.712
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

1:17:48.225 --> 1:17:49.961
Owls and aliens,

1:17:49.996 --> 1:17:58.805
I have officially lost my mind.

1:18:05.847 --> 1:18:06.879
-Hey!
-Hey.

1:18:06.914 --> 1:18:08.848
You left your keys.

1:18:14.086 --> 1:18:15.217
River?

1:18:36.878 --> 1:18:38.471
You okay?

1:18:40.508 --> 1:18:42.277
Not really.

1:18:42.312 --> 1:18:45.082
What are you looking up?

1:18:45.117 --> 1:18:46.281
It's silly.

1:18:49.055 --> 1:18:52.353
You want to explain this?

1:18:52.388 --> 1:18:53.959
I know it sounds ridiculous,

1:18:53.994 --> 1:18:57.391
but I keep hearing owl noises
everywhere I go,

1:18:57.426 --> 1:18:59.261
and I just thought
it would have

1:18:59.296 --> 1:19:02.066
some correlation to something.

1:19:02.101 --> 1:19:05.069
I don't think you're off.

1:19:05.104 --> 1:19:06.840
Why are you messing with me?

1:19:06.875 --> 1:19:10.206
Trust me, I'm not.

1:19:12.914 --> 1:19:15.079
Who's that?

1:19:15.114 --> 1:19:17.411
Um, it's Michael.

1:19:17.446 --> 1:19:19.787
Did I tell you
how weird he was today?

1:19:19.822 --> 1:19:21.250
Weird how?

1:19:21.285 --> 1:19:22.184
I showed up at the store,

1:19:22.220 --> 1:19:27.091
and he acted like
he didn't even know me.

1:19:27.126 --> 1:19:29.390
That is weird,
but he's really old.

1:19:29.425 --> 1:19:31.997
He was probably just having
a moment, you know?

1:19:34.397 --> 1:19:35.396
I don't know.

1:19:35.431 --> 1:19:37.068
I'm gonna go check on him.

1:19:37.103 --> 1:19:38.498
I can drive you.

1:19:38.533 --> 1:19:42.403
No, I just want to be alone
right now, okay?

1:19:42.438 --> 1:19:43.877
Okay.

1:19:43.912 --> 1:19:45.406
I'll call you later.

1:19:45.441 --> 1:19:47.144
Sure.

1:20:18.375 --> 1:20:20.210
Riv, where you at right now?

1:20:20.245 --> 1:20:22.982
Why? I'm heading
to Michael's store.

1:20:23.017 --> 1:20:25.347
Is everything okay?

1:20:25.382 --> 1:20:27.151
I don't know.

1:20:27.186 --> 1:20:29.087
Look, I'll meet you
at the store, all right?

1:20:29.122 --> 1:20:31.122
-Riv?
-Yeah.

1:20:32.928 --> 1:20:34.521
I'll see you soon.

1:20:34.556 --> 1:20:36.061
Fine.

1:20:49.978 --> 1:20:52.176
It was just running.

1:21:03.552 --> 1:21:05.486
I can just take you home.

1:21:13.529 --> 1:21:14.594
River.

1:21:36.255 --> 1:21:38.926
God, River, get it together.

1:21:47.365 --> 1:21:49.365
I'm going to see Jamie.

1:22:21.498 --> 1:22:23.564
Jamie, can you tell me
what the hell is going on?

1:22:23.599 --> 1:22:25.137
-Amanda.
-Amanda what?

1:22:25.172 --> 1:22:26.567
Can you honestly say
she's been acting normal?

1:22:26.602 --> 1:22:28.701
Has she ever acted normal,
Jamie, really?

1:22:28.736 --> 1:22:31.374
Something weird's going on.

1:22:31.409 --> 1:22:34.080
She looks like Amanda,
but she's not my sister.

1:22:34.115 --> 1:22:35.048
What makes you think that?

1:22:35.083 --> 1:22:37.149
Everything, why is she always
around you?

1:22:37.184 --> 1:22:39.448
She's my best friend
and I just lost my mom.

1:22:39.483 --> 1:22:42.121
She randomly shows up
without a phone call.

1:22:53.761 --> 1:22:55.761
I can tell by the look
on your face you get it.

1:22:59.338 --> 1:23:01.734
Something strange
is happening to me.

1:23:01.769 --> 1:23:03.340
-I'm just--
-Yeah, you went missing

1:23:03.375 --> 1:23:05.606
for over a week.

1:23:05.641 --> 1:23:06.640
No.

1:23:06.675 --> 1:23:08.246
It's more than that.

1:23:08.281 --> 1:23:11.414
-I keep seeing--
-Let me guess.

1:23:11.449 --> 1:23:13.251
Amanda was with you
the whole time.

1:23:16.289 --> 1:23:18.454
Yeah.

1:23:18.489 --> 1:23:20.522
She told me
to go back to Vanessa,

1:23:20.557 --> 1:23:23.129
to leave North Carolina.

1:23:23.164 --> 1:23:26.033
The crazy thing is
it's like I had no control

1:23:26.068 --> 1:23:28.695
over my body.

1:23:40.115 --> 1:23:42.742
Look, I don't know
what happened,

1:23:42.777 --> 1:23:44.447
but when you went missing,

1:23:44.482 --> 1:23:46.680
she wasn't as concerned
as me and Michael were.

1:23:50.257 --> 1:23:55.788
Listen, Jamie,
something's wrong with me,

1:23:55.823 --> 1:23:57.625
and it's not PTSD.

1:24:01.796 --> 1:24:03.697
Hey, we've gotta go.

1:24:03.732 --> 1:24:05.369
Jamie? You're leaving.

1:24:05.404 --> 1:24:06.832
-No. I'm not.
-Yes.

1:24:06.867 --> 1:24:07.866
-I'm not leaving.
-She cannot--

1:24:07.902 --> 1:24:09.001
You're not listening,
I'm not leaving you.

1:24:09.036 --> 1:24:11.243
No, she cannot suspect
you're here helping me, no!

1:24:11.278 --> 1:24:12.475
So what do you wanna do?

1:24:14.512 --> 1:24:16.545
What do you wanna do?

1:24:16.580 --> 1:24:18.712
If she wanted me harmed,
it would've happened already,

1:24:18.747 --> 1:24:22.089
so please just leave.

1:24:22.124 --> 1:24:23.486
I'm not crazy about this idea,

1:24:23.521 --> 1:24:25.752
but if you wanna go, go,

1:24:25.787 --> 1:24:27.193
but I'll be close.

1:24:27.228 --> 1:24:29.195
Just leave, okay?

1:24:50.482 --> 1:24:52.119
Why are you here?

1:24:52.154 --> 1:24:55.122
I don't see Dr. Glenn's car.

1:24:55.157 --> 1:24:58.884
Amanda, you've been acting
really strange.

1:24:58.919 --> 1:25:01.524
It's my job to watch you.

1:25:01.559 --> 1:25:04.692
It's my job
to make sure you're okay.

1:25:04.727 --> 1:25:07.299
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it's not your job.

1:25:49.706 --> 1:25:51.310
River.

1:26:16.997 --> 1:26:19.503
You were there.

1:26:19.538 --> 1:26:21.868
I was where?

1:26:21.903 --> 1:26:25.278
The flashes I keep having,
you were there, too.

1:26:25.313 --> 1:26:28.215
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

1:26:30.780 --> 1:26:34.683
What are you not telling me?

1:26:45.597 --> 1:26:49.434
This place,
I've been here before.

1:27:11.557 --> 1:27:14.426
Can you tell me what you see?

1:27:20.533 --> 1:27:22.533
I don't see anything.

1:27:22.568 --> 1:27:24.304
Why are you lying to me?

1:27:28.970 --> 1:27:31.476
You're the one to talk.

1:27:31.511 --> 1:27:33.676
And here I thought
you wanted answers.

1:27:35.812 --> 1:27:37.911
I do.

1:27:37.946 --> 1:27:43.389
My purpose is to guide you,
so I will.

1:27:43.424 --> 1:27:45.424
Where are you going?

1:27:45.459 --> 1:27:46.986
Do you want to come with me?

1:27:48.627 --> 1:27:50.594
There's no turning back now.

1:28:09.714 --> 1:28:11.043
We've arrived.

1:28:12.750 --> 1:28:15.014
Arrived?

1:28:15.049 --> 1:28:17.324
Do you not remember this place?

1:28:37.577 --> 1:28:39.544
-Is this--
-Yes.

1:28:42.615 --> 1:28:44.912
This is where you began
your transition.

1:28:53.494 --> 1:28:55.956
What does that make me?

1:28:55.991 --> 1:28:58.992
The better species.

1:28:59.027 --> 1:29:02.094
And that species is?

1:29:02.129 --> 1:29:05.702
-Not of this world.
-"Species"?

1:29:05.737 --> 1:29:08.034
Am I not even from this world?

1:29:14.614 --> 1:29:16.449
Who are you really?

1:29:18.178 --> 1:29:19.914
A watcher.

1:29:22.919 --> 1:29:25.623
And my mother?

1:29:25.658 --> 1:29:28.395
It's time for
your final transition.

1:29:28.430 --> 1:29:30.760
What has she done with Amanda?

1:29:36.702 --> 1:29:39.901
I don't understand.

1:29:39.936 --> 1:29:41.936
Who you truly are,

1:29:41.971 --> 1:29:43.575
who your mother
so desperately tried

1:29:43.610 --> 1:29:46.479
to protect you from:

1:29:46.514 --> 1:29:48.173
yourself.

1:29:51.112 --> 1:29:53.585
You are special, River.

1:29:56.689 --> 1:29:58.018
Riv?

1:29:58.053 --> 1:30:00.493
-Amanda, what'd you do?
-Jamie.

1:30:00.528 --> 1:30:02.924
I tried to keep you
out of this.

1:30:02.959 --> 1:30:06.895
-I told him we'd be here.
-Why?

1:30:06.930 --> 1:30:09.062
Because he would
never stop either.

1:30:11.605 --> 1:30:12.901
Riv, I can't move.

1:30:16.038 --> 1:30:18.643
Jamie can't go with you.

1:30:18.678 --> 1:30:21.206
This is your journey.

1:30:21.241 --> 1:30:23.879
Now I realize
everything my mom told me...

1:30:23.914 --> 1:30:27.014
-River.
-...led me here.
