with a couple of friends
of mine,

02:59.012 --> 03:01.276
and we formed a band,

met her kid sister, Leather.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.879
A bum.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.856
Leather Tuscadero is worse
than a bum.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.426

Correctamundo.

05:32.098 --> 05:35.728
Three years ago,
she glommed my wallet.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.064
ALL:
Glommed?!

05:37.170 --> 05:39.798
Not only
did she take my wallet--

05:39.906 --> 05:42.466
worse-- she lifted my comb.

05:44.744 --> 05:48.078
And she's still around
to talk about it?

05:48.181 --> 05:51.674
The Fonz is merciful.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.315

was very, very nice.

But she seems so sincere now.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.191
Fonz, listen to me.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.557

she paid her debt,

06:35.662 --> 06:37.630
now all she wants
is a fresh start.

06:37.731 --> 06:41.360
Fonzie, a very brilliant man,
Alexander Pope,

06:41.468 --> 06:46.736
once said that "to err is human,
to forgive is divine."

06:46.840 --> 06:48.034
It's easy for him to say.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.939
He probably never had his wallet
glommed. Well, I did.

06:50.043 --> 06:54.037
Mrs. C., I am filled with thanks
for this dinner.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.348

"I wash my hands
of the whole thing."

Oh, not too tight.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.498
Oh, good.

07:49.602 --> 07:51.628
It's not me.
It's my brother, the priest.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.467
Yeah, I understand, yeah.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.803
But, Rich,
where did these girls come from?

07:55.909 --> 07:57.706
Where have they ever
played before?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.711
Where have they played?

07:59.813 --> 08:01.041
That's a fair question.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.639
Uh... they, uh...

08:03.750 --> 08:05.843
kind... they kind
of played for the state.

08:05.952 --> 08:07.249
-(Richie clears his throat)
- State?

08:07.354 --> 08:09.254
- Yeah. -The Governor's Ball,
the State Fair!

08:09.356 --> 08:12.120
Well... well, no, not exactly.

08:12.225 --> 08:13.659
They, uh...
(clears throat)

08:13.760 --> 08:15.421
Th-They played at reform school.

08:15.528 --> 08:18.191
- Aw, that's nice.
- Yeah.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.697
Reform schools.

08:19.799 --> 08:22.428
You know, we can't do enough
to help these kids go straight.

08:22.535 --> 08:24.561
That's true. That's...

08:24.671 --> 08:26.901
Al, I-l got to level with you.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.941
The girls, they...

08:29.042 --> 08:31.534
they made a mistake,
they... they got caught,

08:31.644 --> 08:35.046
and they were living at
the reform school at the time.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.809

Look, if-if you don't
hire these girls...

-(Al mutters)

08:51.698 --> 08:53.393
- No. -You know something?
Just moments ago,

08:53.500 --> 08:55.661
a great American said,

08:55.769 --> 08:57.828
"Oh, poor kids.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.166
Can't do enough to help 'em."

08:59.272 --> 09:01.400
You want to know something?

09:01.508 --> 09:05.638
Right now, I'm ashamed
of that American!

Rich...

09:10.383 --> 09:12.374
Richie... (chuckles)

09:13.553 --> 09:16.488
It's me, the American.

09:16.589 --> 09:19.320
The least you can do
is-is hear 'em play.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.860
All right, I'll hear 'em play.

09:21.961 --> 09:23.588
It's my first audition.

09:23.696 --> 09:25.255
Oh, thanks, Al.
All right, all right,

09:25.365 --> 09:26.628
I'm going to have 'em here
tomorrow morning.

09:26.733 --> 09:27.962
You're gonna love 'em, Al.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.059
Hey, listen, you're
a great guy-- no, wait--

09:30.170 --> 09:32.570
you are a great American!

09:40.580 --> 09:42.548
A great American.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.845
Alfredo Delvecchio.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.957
RICHIE:
Hey, Fonz.

09:53.059 --> 09:54.789
Glad you could make it
for Leather's audition.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.419
She better be good.

10:00.667 --> 10:01.657
(Snaps fingers)

10:04.404 --> 10:06.805
He's so glad to see me.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.897
You better get ready.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.317
How's Pinky?

10:19.419 --> 10:21.319
She's cool.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.412
So you got sprung, huh?

10:23.523 --> 10:25.423
I did my time.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.926
What's this music con
you're into?

10:28.027 --> 10:29.723
It ain't no con.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.160
Ah, why bother?

10:31.264 --> 10:32.231
You won't listen.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.027
Hey, I got ears. Try me.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.693
Listen, Fonz,
things are different now.

10:38.171 --> 10:41.505
I used to steal 'cause
that was all I knew how to do.

10:41.608 --> 10:44.270
While I was in reform school,
I learned how to sing,

10:44.377 --> 10:45.936
so I don't have
to steal anymore.

10:46.045 --> 10:47.672
This is what I do now.

10:47.780 --> 10:51.376
Well, let's listen
to this great talent

10:51.484 --> 10:54.044
that's put you
on the road to righteousness.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.145
You got it.

10:59.526 --> 11:03.792
Well, three girls,
tight outfits, great start.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.888
Yeah, they might even
be able to sing.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.057
(Potsie chuckles)

11:07.166 --> 11:08.395
A joke, a joke.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.367
I Still got it.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.235
- G reat!
- Huh?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.237
Great.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.237
All right, Al?

14:00.340 --> 14:01.864
Al, what do you say, huh?

14:01.974 --> 14:04.068
Bravissimo! They're great!

14:04.177 --> 14:06.270
They get the job
starting tonight.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.347
(cheering)

14:08.448 --> 14:10.279
LEATHER: All right, girls.
That's enough. Now get going.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.248
- Go get your costumes.
- Okay.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.340
Wait a minute, girls,

14:12.452 --> 14:13.749
we'll give you a ride
in the car.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.082
- All right.
- Yeah, great.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.349
Can I sit next to the kid
with the top hat?

14:17.457 --> 14:19.448
Sure.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.262
She's yours, Potsie.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.764
Huh? Well, now,
what did I tell you?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.770
Fonz, I-isn't she good?
What do you say?

14:32.872 --> 14:36.069
Don't you get yourself excited.

14:36.175 --> 14:38.405
Just 'cause she's doing music
don't mean she went straight.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.674
I heard Al Capone was an
accomplished harmonica player.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.416
Hey, Al, Al, did you hire
the girls yet?

14:45.518 --> 14:46.713
Yeah, they're great.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.913
Oh, boy, are you in trouble.

14:49.021 --> 14:50.785
Trouble? Now wait a minute,
I got nothing in writing.

14:50.890 --> 14:51.982
No, no, don't panic, Al.

14:52.091 --> 14:53.320
Wh-What's the trouble?

14:53.426 --> 14:56.157
Well, I heard through
the grapevine that Officer Kirk

14:56.262 --> 15:00.165
is gonna close down Al's place
if he hires any, uh, ex-cons.

15:00.266 --> 15:01.995
All right, that's it.

15:02.101 --> 15:03.000
Forget it.

15:03.102 --> 15:04.035
I knew it.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.229
Let's just forget
the whole thing.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.328
Yeah, that-that's a good idea.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.338
We should just forget it.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.067
Hold it.
Time out here. Hold it.

15:09.175 --> 15:11.337
I don't want to hear any talking
about throwing in the towel.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.913
Fonz, Officer Kirk!

15:14.013 --> 15:16.243
I'll take care of Officer Kirk,
all right?

15:16.349 --> 15:18.112
Leather and the Suedes
are playing here Friday night

15:18.217 --> 15:20.208
and that's final.

15:27.059 --> 15:29.551
(siren wailing)

15:34.133 --> 15:36.466
All right,
out of my way, Delvecchio.

15:36.569 --> 15:37.866
I gotta talk to these people.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.597
Oh, come on, Officer Kirk.

15:39.705 --> 15:42.174
Can't we discuss this
over an Arnoldburger?

15:42.275 --> 15:45.335
Making death threats, eh?

15:46.813 --> 15:49.646
I'll get you for that,
Delvecchio.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.342
All right, now, hear this.

15:51.450 --> 15:54.284
There's a decadent rock-and-roll
group working here tonight.

15:54.387 --> 15:57.686
We don't like
undesirable people, do we?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.190
They're very undesirable.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.226
We don't like undesirables.

16:01.327 --> 16:03.159
I'm a very unhappy man
right now.

16:03.262 --> 16:05.822
And when I'm unhappy,
I like to write tickets.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.900
Lots and lots of tickets.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.195
How does that hit you?

16:09.302 --> 16:11.202
Now, sound off after me.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.795
Go home, jailbirds.

16:13.906 --> 16:16.307
- CROWD: Go home, jailbirds.
- Come on. Let's hit it!

16:16.409 --> 16:18.241
CROWD:
Go home, jailbirds.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.176
-(chanting): Go home, jailbirds!
- What's going on here?

16:20.279 --> 16:22.111
It's Kirk.
He's making the kids do this.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.115
Fonz, it's Leather.
She won't go on.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.117
- KIRK: I can't hear you
out there! -Go home, jailbirds!

16:26.219 --> 16:29.552
Go home, jailbirds!
Go home, jailbirds!

16:29.655 --> 16:32.557
- Go home, jailbirds! Go home,
jailbirds! -KIRK: Let's hear it!

16:32.658 --> 16:33.887
Why aren't you out there
singing?

16:33.993 --> 16:35.825
Why aren't you making
with the golden tones?

16:35.928 --> 16:38.022
Can't you hear those creeps
out there yelling at us,

16:38.130 --> 16:39.359
"Go home, jailbirds"?

16:39.465 --> 16:41.160
I thought you said
you could handle the cop!

16:41.267 --> 16:42.826
I can, but I won't.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.426
That'll solve your problem
tonight.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.096
What about tomorrow night?
What about next week?

16:46.205 --> 16:49.107
It's time for you to stand up
for your rights, right now.

16:49.208 --> 16:52.439
I have had enough hassles
in my life-- forget it.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.105
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
My mistake.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.877
And I thought that there was
some hope for you.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.009
- You did?
- I wouldn't be standing here

17:00.119 --> 17:02.611
in the middle of the ladies'
room talking to you if I didn't.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.713
Are you gonna forget
about the wallet?

17:04.824 --> 17:06.656
Hey, like I always say,

17:06.759 --> 17:10.888
to err is human,
to forgive is divine.

17:10.997 --> 17:13.157
Now, why don't you just go
right out there

17:13.266 --> 17:15.393
and sing me a song?

17:15.501 --> 17:17.401
- KIRK: Come on! Let's hit it!
- Go home, jailbirds!

17:17.502 --> 17:19.198
- Go home, jailbirds!
- Can't you hear

17:19.305 --> 17:20.795
what that cop
is doing out there?

17:20.906 --> 17:23.808
I'm not ready for that yet.

17:23.910 --> 17:26.810
Whoa.

17:26.913 --> 17:29.245
Then you're a loser.

17:29.348 --> 17:32.079
Listen, Mr. Magic, I'm not you.

17:32.184 --> 17:35.313
I can't control things
with a finger snap.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.389
Hey, that didn't come to me
right away.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.049
It took time, at least...

17:39.158 --> 17:41.286
two nights.

17:42.328 --> 17:43.818
Well, things are different
for me.

17:43.930 --> 17:47.491
Good luck has always been
kind of scarce.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.625
Oh, yeah.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.965
Well, look, don't give me
that bit about, uh,

17:52.071 --> 17:53.903
growing up in a slum.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.497
'Cause that's an excuse.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.041
I've been on my own
since I was six.

17:57.143 --> 17:58.975
Look at me. I didn't quit.
I ain't a loser.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:00.279 --> 18:01.576
You ain't never been
in the jug, either.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.945
That's 'cause I was never
stupid enough to steal.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.509
Now, you got a choice.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.382
You can go out there,
make a fresh start.

18:08.487 --> 18:10.717
Or you can stay in here
and be a bathroom attendant.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.723
It's not me, it's them.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.156
They won't even give me
the chance.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.819
Well, then you got
to win 'em over, don't you?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.362
Like you won me over.
And, believe me,

18:17.463 --> 18:19.693
I am your toughest critic, Jack.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.699
But, Fonz...

18:21.801 --> 18:23.496
I'm scared.

18:23.602 --> 18:27.164
Leather, we all get scared.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.672
You can handle it.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.674
Yeah, they're gonna yell,
but you can lick 'em.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.108
You got talent.

18:32.211 --> 18:34.703
You got... pizzazz.

18:34.814 --> 18:35.713
Leather, Gertie quit!

18:35.815 --> 18:37.544
She's not going out there!

18:37.650 --> 18:39.209
Well, I can take her place.

18:39.318 --> 18:40.445
Bertie can teach me the moves.

18:40.553 --> 18:41.782
Oh, I can do it.

18:41.887 --> 18:43.048
- KIRK: Over here!
- Thanks, Joanie.

18:43.155 --> 18:44.885
Wait outside. I'll let you know.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.152
- Right. -KIRK: I can't hear you!
- What about you, Bertie?

18:47.259 --> 18:48.352
I'm sticking with you.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.691
Whatever you want to do,
I'm going with you.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.389
- I'll wait outside.
- Okay.

18:52.498 --> 18:54.364
CROWD:
Go home, jailbirds!

18:56.002 --> 18:58.163
So what's it gonna be?

18:58.270 --> 19:02.207
You really think I got...
pizzazz?

19:02.308 --> 19:03.867
The Fonz knows
what he's talking about.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.036
You gonna be a singer,
you gonna be a loser?

19:11.484 --> 19:12.508
Singer.

19:12.618 --> 19:13.517
I knew that!

19:13.619 --> 19:15.610
I... I knew that.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.722
I just want you
to go out there now

19:19.825 --> 19:22.124
and I want you to kill 'em,
you understand?

19:22.228 --> 19:24.890
- Fonz...
- Yeah.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.522
- CROWD: Go home, jailbirds!
