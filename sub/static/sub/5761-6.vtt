01:24.398 --> 01:26.720
I've never felt the urge
to hammer something so much in my life.

01:26.767 --> 01:29.381
Here. Take this.
Drink it. Relax. Go.

01:29.425 --> 01:32.080

*****
it'll just take a minute.

01:41.238 --> 01:43.332
- Jim, right?
- Yeah. But, um...

01:43.365 --> 01:44.662
just come sit down.

01:45.428 --> 01:48.350
Now, jim here-
have a seat-

01:48.727 --> 01:51.372
has combination skinas
anyone can see.

01:51.408 --> 01:52.821
I have a very effective

01:52.856 --> 01:54.543
line of oil-freemoisturizers for men

01:54.588 --> 01:57.233
that will balance out
jim's ph brilliantly.

01:57.275 --> 01:58.652
If I can just find it...

01:59.146 --> 02:00.492
Ah, here it is.

02:00.536 --> 02:03.651
Now, as you can see,
it doesn't take much.

02:03.725 --> 02:07.361
I'm basically padding
the product on jim's t-zone-

02:07.668 --> 02:09.711
here and here.

02:11.318 --> 02:13.563
There.

02:14.176 --> 02:16.281
I know.
Isn't it a great look?

02:16.317 --> 02:19.162
Well, it was a pretty
good look before you put it on, too.

02:19.197 --> 02:21.783
Well, that was fun.
Thank you.

02:21.816 --> 02:23.132
But I should go plow
the north 40 now.

02:23.167 --> 02:24.513
It's ok. Go.
You're a champ.

02:24.518 --> 02:27.351
Josie, I know you have
reat stuff for all of us, too. Right?

02:27.355 --> 02:28.502
Oh, right.
Let me show you...

02:28.506 --> 02:30.530
I'm comfortable with my masculinity.

02:30.535 --> 02:33.641
That would have put me into
therapy for a couple of years.

02:34.278 --> 02:37.361
Honey, what's wrong?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

02:37.967 --> 02:41.352
Really?
Here? Where?

02:41.605 --> 02:43.991
Right in front of me.

03:19.598 --> 03:21.590
I'm glad the party it's over.

03:22.238 --> 03:23.361
How 'bout now?

03:23.397 --> 03:24.682
Ahh, it's gone.

03:24.935 --> 03:26.340
That was beyond creepy.

03:26.616 --> 03:30.160
Yeah, skull where my face was
supposed to be. That's not good.

03:32.307 --> 03:34.093
Is that some kind of
portent of doom?

03:34.138 --> 03:37.391
No, no.
At least I don't think so.

03:37.437 --> 03:39.402
All right.
What about ghosts?

03:39.597 --> 03:41.060
Do you see any
right now?

03:41.095 --> 03:42.581
No. Nothing.

03:45.817 --> 03:47.310
Hey, what's wrong?

03:47.477 --> 03:49.891
Let's just get out of the house
and go for a walk.

03:56.198 --> 03:58.742
So, uh, have you heard
from your mother yet?

03:58.747 --> 04:02.021
She said she will call me if they
can move the surgery up a day.

04:02.025 --> 04:03.180
Her poor knee.

04:03.187 --> 04:07.751
But the good news is josie did sell $350
worth of her stuff.

04:07.757 --> 04:09.303
Guess what
the big seller was.

04:09.306 --> 04:10.681
I don't think
I want to know.

04:10.686 --> 04:12.160
Moisturizer for men.

04:12.175 --> 04:13.840
Comforting to know
that if you do not

04:13.845 --> 04:16.551
do well in the medical industry,
you could be a male model.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.261
You know, you're killing me
right here.

04:18.265 --> 04:19.332
You're killing me.

04:19.337 --> 04:22.923
I think it's great that I have a
husband women find so attractive.

04:22.926 --> 04:24.000
You  know, it's funny.

04:24.005 --> 04:25.792
'Cause that feeling
doesn't cut both ways.

04:25.796 --> 04:28.121
- Not for me.
- That's because you're ossessive.

04:28.125 --> 04:30.122
Guys have the whole
caveman thing going on.

04:30.125 --> 04:30.940
That's right!

04:30.948 --> 04:34.803
- I want my woman for myself.
- Ooh. You got her.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.132
All right.

04:40.867 --> 04:45.521
Ahh, ohh! Hey, beautiful,
where did you come from?

04:45.536 --> 04:47.972
- What do you see?
- A cat.

04:49.245 --> 04:52.660
- A ghost cat?
- An exotic looking one.

04:56.167 --> 04:59.841
- What happened?
- Kitty not as cute as I thought.

04:59.847 --> 05:03.032
- Go away, kitty.
- Where is homer the dog when you need him?

05:03.038 --> 05:05.391
Yeah. Where is homer?
I miss homer.

05:05.397 --> 05:06.963
Not today's problem.

05:06.965 --> 05:12.252
- Hey, do you hear that?
- No... I don'T.

05:13.438 --> 05:16.841
- I don't hear anything.
- How weird is that.

05:17.966 --> 05:20.692
Ok. That's
just a phone.

05:22.087 --> 05:25.281
Mom.
Oh, well, that's great news!

05:25.796 --> 05:28.413
Tuesday.
The sooner the better.

05:31.517 --> 05:34.511
Stop it.
Ok. No, no. I'm sorry.

05:34.808 --> 05:37.102
Yeah.
No, it's not a problem.

05:37.115 --> 05:38.820
Ok, well,
I'll call you tomorrow.

05:38.825 --> 05:40.341
- By Mrs. Gordon.
- Bye.

05:41.257 --> 05:45.952
Stop it... Now, she says,
"it's just knee surgery.

05:45.956 --> 05:48.193
There's no need to go
to so much trouble.

06:15.448 --> 06:16.693
Mom?

06:17.838 --> 06:19.223
Mom?!

06:37.348 --> 06:41.113
Now what if your mother really doesn't
want anyone around her right now?

06:41.116 --> 06:42.470
Well, that's too bad.

06:42.476 --> 06:44.821
'Cause I'm not one
to ignore dreams.

06:44.827 --> 06:46.092
Especially dreams
like that one.

06:46.096 --> 06:48.590
Look, it was probably
a guilt trip.

06:48.598 --> 06:50.450
Oh, well, thank you, Freud.

06:50.457 --> 06:51.861
I'll call you
as soon as I get there.

06:53.415 --> 06:57.992
Wait a minute.
Don't drive crazy.

06:58.007 --> 07:00.031
I have to go.
I'll miss you.

07:00.038 --> 07:02.032
It's my poker night any how.

07:02.036 --> 07:04.372
Um, that's where you're supposed
to say I'll miss you, too, honey.

07:04.388 --> 07:05.382
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:05.385 --> 07:06.781
I always do.

07:06.785 --> 07:09.543
Hey, have the game
at our house.

07:09.557 --> 07:10.930
No, that never
really works out.

07:10.938 --> 07:12.810
Why not? You guys
take turns don't you?

07:12.817 --> 07:15.173
Yeah. It's been my turn
for a couple of weeks now.

07:15.176 --> 07:16.773
And I keep trying to avoid it.

07:16.778 --> 07:19.471
You know, unexpected visitors
and such.

07:19.475 --> 07:22.633
Hey, I'm gone. The ghosts are gone.
Have the game at the house.

07:22.638 --> 07:25.772
Huh. Right.
Call me.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.110
Maybe. Bye.

07:36.788 --> 07:39.783
- 3 queens.
- You've been playing queens all night.

07:39.785 --> 07:42.843
Well, what can I say, guys?
The ladies love me tonight.

07:42.848 --> 07:45.380
So, clancy,
game at your house?

07:45.385 --> 07:47.240
Man that almost
never happens

07:47.248 --> 07:49.343
He wants to keep us
away from melinda, doesn't trust us.

07:49.348 --> 07:50.831
- Would you?
- Good point.

07:50.836 --> 07:52.180
We played here
a few months ago.

07:52.188 --> 07:53.730
Yeah, when his wife
was out of town.

07:53.738 --> 07:55.182
Yeah, where is she now,
clancy?

07:55.186 --> 07:57.283
-  Out of town.
- Yeah.

07:58.325 --> 08:00.620
Jim clancy,
master electrician.

08:00.626 --> 08:03.823
*****

08:05.137 --> 08:09.303
- All around the horn.
- Uh, I'll go 2.

08:16.405 --> 08:18.902
- You gotta good card, man.
- Now that's tension.

08:18.906 --> 08:21.082
No, I didn't do anything.
I was holding them normal.

08:21.085 --> 08:24.370
- Yeah, right.
- Do it again.

08:27.356 --> 08:29.702
- Flaher, you ok?
- Flaher?

08:29.707 --> 08:30.702
Flaher?!

08:34.195 --> 08:36.571
Flaher? 1, 2, 3.

08:37.513 --> 08:39.014
Got it? We got?

08:47.921 --> 08:49.516
You in?

08:49.868 --> 08:52.213
What? Am I in? What?

08:52.218 --> 08:53.211
I almost just died
right in front of ya.

08:53.215 --> 08:55.493
- Almost doesn't count.
- You're cold.

09:09.276 --> 09:10.603
Hey, I'll tell you what.

09:10.608 --> 09:12.461
It's gettin' a little
late. All right...

09:12.466 --> 09:13.962
I gotta checivo.
My house next week.

09:17.536 --> 09:19.423
Thanks
for coming, guys.

09:58.987 --> 10:01.190
Who are you?

10:35.525 --> 10:36.702
Yeah?

10:36.705 --> 10:39.980
Hey, amarillo slim.
Did I wake you?

10:39.998 --> 10:43.231
No. No. No.
No. Well, yeah. A little.

10:47.167 --> 10:49.411
- How's your mother?
- Asleep.

10:49.427 --> 10:51.090
<i>Right. Of course
she would be now.</i>

10:51.096 --> 10:52.391
<i>She a little worried
about tomorrow?</i>

10:52.395 --> 10:53.562
No, she's good.

10:53.566 --> 10:56.662
We ordered in chinese
food and rented a movie.

10:56.668 --> 10:57.791
It was nice, actually.

10:57.797 --> 11:02.003
Ooh, can you do me a favor tomorrow
and just drop in on delia at the store?

11:02.005 --> 11:04.280
I want to make sure
she doesn't get too overwhelmed.

11:04.298 --> 11:09.942
- Delia, right. Ok.
- Are you... are you all right?

11:11.647 --> 11:13.690
I was having
a really weird dream.

11:13.697 --> 11:16.172
Uh. Well,
welcome to my world.

11:17.185 --> 11:19.060
Mel, you know
I really love you.

11:19.648 --> 11:24.331
- I really do.
- Jim, I love you, too.

11:26.068 --> 11:28.130
Listen, just go
back to sleep.

11:28.138 --> 11:31.060
Ok? Call me
in the morning.

12:10.018 --> 12:11.340
Thanks so much
for coming in.

12:11.377 --> 12:13.141
We're gonna be online
soon. So look us up.

12:15.307 --> 12:17.643
Hey, jim. To what
do I owe this honor?

12:17.645 --> 12:18.951
Oh, nothing, you know.

12:18.956 --> 12:21.263
I just thought I'd drop by,
say hi before work.

12:21.265 --> 12:22.570
See if everything's ok.

12:23.447 --> 12:25.960
So melinda was worried
that I'd be overwhelmed?

12:25.968 --> 12:27.063
Yeah. Exactly.

12:27.065 --> 12:29.433
See? I'm getting
to know her like a book.

12:29.877 --> 12:31.301
Hey, how's her mom?

12:31.317 --> 12:34.613
Oh, her mom should be out of surgery
in a couple of minutes now.

12:34.618 --> 12:36.651
What? What?
No, no. It's-

12:38.535 --> 12:41.183
I'm  so sorry!
I just have this thing about bugs.

12:41.188 --> 12:42.990
Apparently so do I.

12:43.007 --> 12:47.032
- Friends of yours?
- Houseguests.

12:47.098 --> 12:49.820
Some people have ants,
other people have termites.

12:50.115 --> 12:53.170
- You have beetles?
- I don't know what I have.

12:53.176 --> 12:54.760
Did you see
which way they went?

12:54.767 --> 12:57.441
Somewhere where
I'll never see them again I hope.

12:57.448 --> 13:00.001
All right,
I gotta go.

13:00.136 --> 13:02.933
I should go.
Look, you havemy cell, right?

13:02.938 --> 13:04.671
And you can call me
in case anything goes wrong?

13:04.676 --> 13:07.663
Yeah. Just as long
as the beetles don't form a gang

13:07.668 --> 13:09.962
and come after me,
I think I'll be fine.

13:09.967 --> 13:13.430
Ok. If they do,
call me.

13:21.585 --> 13:23.823
Yeah, she sailed
through the operation.

13:23.827 --> 13:25.823
I'll feel better
when I can see her.

13:25.827 --> 13:28.421
I can't get that surgery dream
out of my head.

13:29.096 --> 13:31.431
- How's your hangover?
- What hangover?

13:31.437 --> 13:33.852
Oh, come on. You were on
a different planet last night.

13:33.857 --> 13:36.332
I sensed the presence
of a 6-pack at least.

13:36.348 --> 13:39.873
You sensed the presence of something
but it wasn't alcohol related.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.661
Wait, you had a ghost
last night without me?

13:42.668 --> 13:44.020
<i>Well, something strange
is going on.</i>

13:44.027 --> 13:46.790
Last night there were
lights flickering, cards flying,

13:46.797 --> 13:49.860
and there were bugs-beetles-
I saw them on the floor.

13:49.865 --> 13:51.400
They were just swimming
in my shirt.

13:51.407 --> 13:54.421
- Ooh, kinky.
- I'm serious. - Sorry.

13:54.427 --> 13:57.472
- What kind of beetles?
- Shiny green things.

13:58.125 --> 14:00.050
Kind of beautiful actually.

14:02.218 --> 14:06.552
Look, mel, last night I had
this dream- this weird dream-

14:06.555 --> 14:10.021
there was this girl
and she was on an operating table.

14:10.025 --> 14:12.283
- Same dream as mine.
- Not exactly.

14:12.287 --> 14:17.143
She had a cat, which reminds me, you
remember you saw this exotic ghost cat?

14:17.145 --> 14:18.992
Why  would the cat
be in your dream?

14:18.996 --> 14:20.780
You're  asking me
like I know the answer.

14:20.786 --> 14:22.420
Sorry. Thinking out loud.

14:22.428 --> 14:25.032
- Was there anything besides beetles?
- Scalpel.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.490
- As in surgery?
- And sharp.

14:28.776 --> 14:30.793
Ok, this has to be
about my mother.

14:30.798 --> 14:34.140
I'm getting a little freaked out.
So I'm gonna go in and check on her.

14:34.397 --> 14:35.451
Well, what do I do?

14:35.456 --> 14:38.810
Well, we have to find out what the
connection is between the symbols.

14:38.828 --> 14:41.120
Do you remember the guy I was
telling you about... professor payne?

14:41.125 --> 14:42.800
Yeah. Yeah.
The guy at rock land U.

14:42.818 --> 14:44.840
Go and see him. Ok?

14:44.847 --> 14:47.360
He knows all about symbols
and the supernatural.

14:47.365 --> 14:49.541
He'll be able to tell you
if there's a connection.

14:49.548 --> 14:51.360
Wait. I just show up there?
I don't even know the guy.

14:51.366 --> 14:52.970
No, it's ok.
He's a good guy.

14:52.977 --> 14:54.690
He just doesn't know
about what I can do.

14:54.695 --> 14:57.311
- So keep it all theoretical.
- Theoretical? - I gotta go.

14:57.318 --> 14:59.870
- I love you, bye.
- Theoretical.

15:06.778 --> 15:08.990
Hey, uh, sorry, man.

15:08.996 --> 15:12.282
I'm looking for a professor,
a dr. Payne.

15:12.287 --> 15:15.200
So are half the credit card
companies in the U.S.

15:15.907 --> 15:19.170
- What can I do for you?
- You're payne?

15:19.178 --> 15:24.491
- You are...?
- Sorry. I was expecting somebody older.

15:24.496 --> 15:27.570
Why don't you come back
in 25 years?

15:27.576 --> 15:30.581
Hey, I'm jim clancy.
I'm melinda gordon's husband.

15:30.588 --> 15:32.751
You know, she comes by
for help sometimes.

15:32.755 --> 15:34.432
You're melinda's husband.

15:34.438 --> 15:37.613
Wow, this is really
very interesting.

15:37.617 --> 15:39.841
Yeah. She's out of town.
But she sent me over-

15:39.845 --> 15:43.000
- Your wife fascinates me.
- Me, too.

15:43.005 --> 15:44.551
Look, some
times she says you help her.

15:44.557 --> 15:45.841
And I'm working on this project,

15:45.847 --> 15:47.582
and I was wondering
if you could give me a hand.

15:47.585 --> 15:49.541
- What kind of project?
- Uh, I'm writing a book.

15:49.547 --> 15:51.753
Everybody's doing it
these days.

15:51.757 --> 15:53.810
Melinda told me
you were a paramedic.

15:53.815 --> 15:56.151
Yeah. I am. Yeah.
See? It's a hobby.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.213
- Saving lives is a hobby?
- No, writing.

15:58.217 --> 16:02.032
- Oh, the writing's the hobby.
- Um, I'm a little lost right now.

16:02.036 --> 16:04.301
I've been playing
with all this symbolism.

16:04.308 --> 16:07.113
Cats, for instance.
And I...

16:10.575 --> 16:13.872
Here you go, melinda's
husband. Take your pick.

16:18.887 --> 16:20.901
- How about that one?
- Excellent. Abyssinian.

16:20.905 --> 16:23.791
Egyptian. Very spooky
looking, huh?.

16:24.358 --> 16:28.653
You know, the ancient egyptians,
they were crazy about cats, jim.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.602
If you killed a cat,
you had to be killed.

16:30.605 --> 16:32.942
If your cat died,
you went into mourning.

16:32.948 --> 16:35.362
You had to shave off your
ebrows while in mourning.

16:35.368 --> 16:38.473
That must-that must
have been a fantastic look.

16:38.476 --> 16:39.741
Right.

16:40.255 --> 16:44.921
Ok. What if in this story
I throw in some beetles,

16:44.927 --> 16:46.590
what would that start
to signify?

16:46.595 --> 16:49.031
- Well, that would depend.
- On what? - On the beetle.

16:49.036 --> 16:51.401
I've always been
partial to george.

16:52.928 --> 16:55.060
I'm joking. That's a joke.

16:55.065 --> 16:57.391
Guess melinda hasn't
told you a lot about me.

16:57.396 --> 17:00.043
Nope. No, no. She just said
you were a great guy.

17:00.045 --> 17:02.283
Well, then you've been
sadly misinformed.

17:02.285 --> 17:05.843
- What color are these beetles?
- Green. And they're shiny.

17:05.848 --> 17:10.040
Green? Those are scarabs. There's a
lot of egyptian symbolismin your book.

17:10.045 --> 17:11.391
Could be.

17:13.166 --> 17:21.633
- Here you go... Dung beetles.
- That one.

17:21.635 --> 17:23.270
Used a lot in
egyptian iconography,

17:23.277 --> 17:26.121
usually symbolizing
regeneration and rebirth.

17:26.126 --> 17:30.430
Right. So if I was-
uh, if my main character was seeing-

17:30.437 --> 17:33.791
getting sent these symbols,
what do you think that would mean?

17:33.798 --> 17:36.103
Could mean a lot of things.
It could mean beauty, egypt.

17:36.118 --> 17:39.780
It could mean the goddess isis,
she's the most powerful, most popular.

17:39.788 --> 17:42.213
But you have cats.
That's a powerful motif.

17:42.216 --> 17:45.290
That would make me think
of the goddess bast.

17:45.297 --> 17:47.790
Bast was the protector
of cats and women.

17:47.795 --> 17:50.461
- Did you just say "bast?"
- Bast, yeah. Just now.

17:50.467 --> 17:52.543
Bast cosmetics.
Do you know bast cosmetics?

17:52.548 --> 17:57.891
Cosmetics? I'm not, um...
that's not my area of expertise.

17:57.895 --> 18:01.502
You know, doc, you helped me a lot.
I owe you one. Thanks.

18:01.506 --> 18:05.240
You're leaving? Wait. Do-do you guys
do this all the time, the two of you?

18:05.246 --> 18:07.503
- What?
- The whole I'm saying something,

18:07.505 --> 18:10.562
but I'm not tell you what I mean.
I'm being wacky and evasive thing.

18:10.566 --> 18:12.142
Do you both do it?

18:12.148 --> 18:14.463
I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:14.467 --> 18:17.571
Yea. Like that.
That's-that's good.

18:33.916 --> 18:35.871
What do you want?

19:09.476 --> 19:13.112
So the ghost is attached
to bast cosmetics?

19:13.117 --> 19:16.321
Bast is all about beauty.
She was the protector of cats.

19:16.327 --> 19:23.732
- And their logo is a beetle and a cat.
- So, this girl from your dream...

19:24.666 --> 19:26.882
- what was she like?
- Scary.

19:26.885 --> 19:31.063
- Was she beautiful?
- She wasn't exactly homely.

19:31.066 --> 19:33.563
Ugh, jim, come on.
I can take it.

19:33.565 --> 19:34.871
Spit it out.
Was she beautiful?

19:34.878 --> 19:36.792
She's drop dead
gorgeous. She looks like a model.

19:36.808 --> 19:38.833
A simple yes
would have done.

19:38.836 --> 19:40.111
Hey, hey, you just said-

19:40.117 --> 19:43.823
Look, how many times exactly have your
dream of this drop deadgorgeous model?

19:43.826 --> 19:46.671
Mel, I want the dreams
to end just as much as you do.

19:46.677 --> 19:50.511
Ok. Obiously your visions and dreams
have nothing to do with my mother.

19:50.516 --> 19:53.130
So she must be connected to
bast cosmetics.

19:53.135 --> 19:55.562
- Maybe she's a model.
- Was one of their models.

19:55.825 --> 19:57.521
- Dead?
- Don't you think?

19:57.525 --> 19:58.943
Well, then why
is she coming to me?

19:58.945 --> 19:59.732
I don't know.

19:59.735 --> 20:02.001
Maybe she was attached to somebody
at the makeover party.

20:02.328 --> 20:03.521
Oh, thank you.

20:03.526 --> 20:06.751
Or maybe she's using you
to get to me.

20:06.755 --> 20:09.332
All right, well,
how do we find her?

20:09.336 --> 20:12.321
I don't know. Bast is a small company.
But they still advertise. So...

20:12.327 --> 20:14.201
you'll have to go
to a newsstand, get some magazines,

20:14.205 --> 20:15.671
and look for her picture.

20:15.678 --> 20:17.821
I'll talk to you later.
Come back soon.

20:18.197 --> 20:19.352
Bye.

20:33.568 --> 20:35.171
There you are.

20:43.426 --> 20:45.781
Do you have smithsonian?

20:45.785 --> 20:48.973
Uh, yeah, it's over there
behind national geographic.

20:49.696 --> 20:52.901
Excuse me. Sorry.
Ahh, you're...

20:53.858 --> 20:55.643
- Jim.
- Jim-melinda's husband.

20:55.648 --> 20:56.962
Right. And you're
dr. Payne, right?

20:56.967 --> 20:58.610
Yes, I am.
How's the book coming?

20:59.195 --> 21:00.512
Slowly.

21:00.908 --> 21:04.312
Ok. That's one
les angelique, one fashion today,

21:04.318 --> 21:08.622
one wardrobe plus,
one tween chique magazine.

21:08.626 --> 21:10.702
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.

21:10.705 --> 21:13.991
- Melinda's still out of town?
- She's coming back soon.

21:19.506 --> 21:21.652
$750?

21:21.656 --> 21:24.212
I know it's a lot.
But it's totally worth it.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.492
This woman will come
and do all your colors.

21:26.496 --> 21:27.641
What you look best in.

21:27.645 --> 21:30.162
What's you power color.
What's your calming color.

21:30.167 --> 21:33.182
So what's your throw
away money color?

21:33.307 --> 21:35.673
Wait-isn't that
melinda's husband?

21:36.026 --> 21:36.671
Hmm. Nice sedway.

21:36.677 --> 21:39.850
Hey, well, if it
isn't my guinea pig.

21:39.856 --> 21:41.780
Hope you're using
that moisturizer.

21:41.795 --> 21:44.631
Yeah. Yeah. All the guys in the firehouse
have noticed a big difference.

21:44.635 --> 21:47.563
Jim, have you ever thought
about having your colors done?

21:47.568 --> 21:49.763
- Sorry?
- Pay no attention.

21:49.765 --> 21:52.153
Hey, guys, I was wondering
if you could do me a favor.

21:52.155 --> 21:54.423
You probably know
more about this kind of stuff than I do.

21:54.435 --> 21:58.860
- Do you know who she is?
- Oh, my god.

21:58.865 --> 22:01.190
That's eva turner.

22:01.707 --> 22:04.822
I- I'm sorry but that just
caught me by surprise.

22:04.836 --> 22:07.950
- Eva-eva was a friend of mine.
- Was?

22:08.747 --> 22:12.431
- Yeah, she died a couple of weeks ago.
- And why do you ask?

22:13.265 --> 22:14.872
Uh, a friend of mine-

22:15.378 --> 22:20.363
one of the guy sat the firehouse he's
he's really into models and especially her.

22:20.368 --> 22:24.480
So, when I saw the bast cosmetics,
I thought maybe I could get an address.

22:24.488 --> 22:27.532
He wanted to send
a fan letter. That kind of thing.

22:28.025 --> 22:30.881
Hmm. Oh, well.
She used to live in my building.

22:30.887 --> 22:33.863
She was the one that
got me into selling bast cosmetics.

22:33.867 --> 22:37.132
- She was so nice.
- How did she die?

22:37.507 --> 22:42.151
Ahh, that's the horrible thing. She went
in for an appendectomy, a routine.

22:42.155 --> 22:45.631
Something went wrong
with the anesthesia, and she just died.

22:45.637 --> 22:48.890
We're going to the memorial
tomorrow in the city.

22:49.077 --> 22:51.791
- Oh, yeah. Where?
- All saints chapel.

22:52.107 --> 22:54.720
Sorry to interrupt
your lunch.

22:54.738 --> 22:57.231
And sorry about that.
See ya, delia.

22:57.237 --> 23:00.522
- Take care, jim.
- Died during surgery?

23:00.527 --> 23:03.893
Well, that explains the hospital dreams
and the scalpel appearing.

23:03.895 --> 23:07.460
Yeah, there's a memorial service
tomorrow in the city, at a chapel.

23:07.465 --> 23:10.242
- And in your dreams?
- Exactly. People praying.

23:10.625 --> 23:13.182
Well, she wants you
to go to that memorial.

23:13.186 --> 23:16.270
There's something or someone there
you're suposed to see.

23:16.278 --> 23:18.801
Don't you think it'll look little
strange, I mean, if I go?

23:18.808 --> 23:21.891
Yeah, if you go alone,
so take somebody with you and blend in.

23:21.907 --> 23:23.530
Who?

23:24.728 --> 23:27.270
Dude, I'll tell you,
this is a little weird.

23:27.277 --> 23:30.133
- I don't even know the deceased.
- I know.

23:30.135 --> 23:32.571
Think of it as show of support.

23:35.486 --> 23:37.202
That's  like something
from e! Channel.

23:37.206 --> 23:40.373
- Are you-do you know these people?
- Not exactly.

23:51.325 --> 23:55.350
- Lookin' for someone?
- Not really.

24:00.506 --> 24:02.581
You have some parallel
life you haven't told me about?

24:02.586 --> 24:05.712
I mean, are you an underwear
model by night or something?

24:06.517 --> 24:09.010
Flaher, just go with me
on this one, ok?

24:09.226 --> 24:11.592
Remember, I saved your life
the other night.

24:14.415 --> 24:16.432
- Who-who's that?
- Who?

24:16.446 --> 24:20.240
Other side of the aisle, purple.
Looks familiar.

24:20.685 --> 24:25.223
That's delia. Delia banks.
She works with melinda at the store.

24:25.375 --> 24:27.673
Linda's a beautiful woman.

24:37.436 --> 24:40.601
- Funny, but I know her.
- Who?

24:41.196 --> 24:42.802
That woman.

24:44.637 --> 24:50.693
She lived in the town I grew up in.
I used to mow their lawn.

25:13.407 --> 25:17.662
Eva. Eva, eva.

25:18.688 --> 25:20.991
Eva kaminsky.

25:27.117 --> 25:31.421
That's eva kaminsky.
I know this girl.

25:32.826 --> 25:36.523
- Isn't that why we're here?
- Right.

25:39.718 --> 25:44.572
It's just, I went to high school with
her and she was... really shy.

25:45.556 --> 25:52.953
It's hard to imagine that... that girl
turned into that girl.

25:53.727 --> 25:56.143
Please take your seats.

26:12.215 --> 26:17.120
I am marybeth kaminsky,
eva's mother.

26:17.125 --> 26:22.352
Thank you all so much for coming. Eva would be
very happy to know so many peoplecame for her.

26:26.568 --> 26:29.691
A child shouldn't
ever die before their mother.

26:29.697 --> 26:34.603
No one's child.
Eva was the light of our lives.

26:35.277 --> 26:40.720
She was so beautiful, not just on the
outside, but on the inside, too.

26:42.697 --> 26:43.962
I remember-

27:01.327 --> 27:03.662
Surprised to see
you here, jim.

27:03.668 --> 27:06.500
Look at you.
You grew up so nice!

27:06.507 --> 27:07.630
- Thanks.
- How's your mother?

27:07.638 --> 27:09.902
- She's good, thanks for asking.
- Oh, you're welcome.

27:09.908 --> 27:11.611
She moved on up
a couple of years ago, I think.

27:11.618 --> 27:12.993
Well, that's nice.

27:12.995 --> 27:15.862
I cannot tell you
how sorry I am about eva.

27:15.867 --> 27:19.002
I didn't even know
she was going into the hospital.

27:19.008 --> 27:23.663
I mean, she was always so terrified
of doctors and hospitals and...

27:24.835 --> 27:28.321
she probably just, uh, didn't
want us to be worried, so...

27:29.057 --> 27:32.160
remember how she was always
obsessed with people's feelings?

27:32.168 --> 27:34.963
I just remember her
being very shy.

27:34.965 --> 27:40.521
But she made us so proud. I mean, to open
a magazine and seeher right in there.

27:40.525 --> 27:43.320
So beautiful, so confident.

27:43.327 --> 27:46.163
Just exactly the way
I wanted her to be.

27:46.625 --> 27:50.223
I... I never thought
she'd go so far.

27:52.497 --> 27:53.650
Linda.

27:53.657 --> 27:56.940
Linda's the one
I thought would bein the spotlight.

27:56.947 --> 28:00.963
Jim clancy. Hi.
What a surprise.

28:01.908 --> 28:04.252
Eva would so love
that you came.

28:04.257 --> 28:06.331
You know, I don't think
she'd even remember me.

28:06.345 --> 28:08.920
Oh, she would.
She talked about you.

28:08.928 --> 28:11.250
She said you gave her
a great gift.

28:16.347 --> 28:18.463
Well, listen, I really have to
get back to upton.

28:18.466 --> 28:22.243
I don't like to come into the city very much
'cause it really makes me kinda nervous,

28:22.248 --> 28:25.002
so... so good to see you.

28:25.307 --> 28:28.190
- Bye. Please come visit us.
- I will.

28:33.457 --> 28:35.882
Hey, can I ask you-
who's that woman?

28:36.388 --> 28:38.522
Oh, that's diana lassiter.

28:38.526 --> 28:42.223
She was eva's agent.
She's mine now, too.

28:42.225 --> 28:46.741
- Ok, so, you'r real model, too?
- Soon, I hope.

28:46.745 --> 28:48.840
I've got a lot
of head shots out there.

28:48.847 --> 28:50.972
Did you get help
from your sister?

28:50.978 --> 28:54.361
Everything. She had
the whole thing down.

28:54.367 --> 28:57.883
- She was totally focused.
- That's good, I guess.

28:58.155 --> 29:03.562
Yeah, she overcame a lot.
She, uh, fought really hard.

29:04.148 --> 29:08.482
Mostly with herself, but...
she came out on top.

29:09.307 --> 29:14.010
She gave herself that power, you know?
And then this happened.

29:16.407 --> 29:18.631
I better get back
to my mother.

29:19.928 --> 29:22.771
Thank you.
I hope you come see us soon.

29:22.777 --> 29:24.100
Take care, linda.

29:37.636 --> 29:39.992
- You're jim's friend.
- Yeah, tim flaherty.

29:39.996 --> 29:44.093
- You're delia banks, right?
- That's right. Nice of you to come.

29:44.758 --> 29:46.172
Yeah, well, I-

29:46.177 --> 29:50.392
- You must bein hog heaven here.
- Come again?

29:50.395 --> 29:52.112
I mean, with all the models.

29:52.115 --> 29:54.492
Jim told me you had
a thing for models.

29:54.505 --> 29:59.020
Oh, jim told ya. Nah.
Too skinny.

30:00.376 --> 30:01.690
Really?

30:04.837 --> 30:07.261
Yes, Mrs. Lassiter,
I'm from eva's hometown.

30:07.268 --> 30:09.633
I've never met anyone
from eva's real life.

30:09.648 --> 30:11.213
I didn't really
know her.

30:11.217 --> 30:14.510
I used to work for her parents when I was
young mowing lawns, things like that.

30:14.517 --> 30:17.110
I hadn't actually seen her
since I moved away.

30:17.118 --> 30:20.492
Oh. She was a friend
and a client for about 5 years.

30:20.498 --> 30:23.773
Hey, uh, you represent
her-her sister linda, right?

30:24.876 --> 30:26.862
Well, we'll see if she has
what it takes. She might.

30:26.896 --> 30:28.303
She's certainly
beautiful.

30:28.338 --> 30:31.220
Yeah, she's that,
but, um, it takes more than that.

30:31.268 --> 30:34.110
- It takes a certain toughness.
- Did eva have that?

30:34.227 --> 30:35.753
I mean, that toughness?

30:36.876 --> 30:42.092
Look, I loved eva like a sister,
but... she was a bit of a wreck.

30:42.896 --> 30:44.020
A wreck?

30:44.057 --> 30:45.263
You know, I think she might have been
a little freaked out

30:45.305 --> 30:47.020
that her sister was
gonna be a model.

30:47.055 --> 30:50.453
You know, I think maybe eva thought
that she'd replace her.

30:50.507 --> 30:53.620
How could she worry about
being old when she wasn't even 30?

30:54.235 --> 30:57.221
She's practically a senior citizen
in this business, honey.

30:57.915 --> 31:00.040
There was something
more than that, though.

31:00.688 --> 31:02.610
She was trying to prove
something to somebody,

31:02.655 --> 31:04.281
and the more successful
she got,

31:04.755 --> 31:06.561
the more she was afraid
of losing it.

31:06.595 --> 31:10.353
- I've seen it happen.
- Thanks for your time.

31:10.807 --> 31:14.651
- It was nice talking to you.
- And you. Take care.

31:29.775 --> 31:31.310
Eva...

31:31.778 --> 31:34.623
if you're here,
I wish I could help you.

31:37.198 --> 31:38.751
I wish I knew
what you wanted...

31:40.196 --> 31:41.993
what you needed.

31:48.387 --> 31:50.361
I don't even know
why you remember me.

31:50.397 --> 31:51.740
You were just a kid.

31:54.806 --> 31:57.070
You were too shy
to even say hello.

32:31.158 --> 32:33.720
Hi.
I'm jim clancy.

32:58.396 --> 33:01.990
You're the prettiest
girl here. Don't forget that.

33:07.775 --> 33:10.923
Person who made me
feel pretty.

33:23.718 --> 33:25.463
Jim, I'm home.

33:27.766 --> 33:29.251
I didn't even remember it.

33:29.285 --> 33:30.730
Well, obviously she did.

33:32.405 --> 33:35.633
How can a ghost put some
thing like that in my head?

33:35.678 --> 33:37.292
She has a strong connection
with you.

33:37.328 --> 33:40.652
Sometimes we have no idea
the effect we can have on other people.

33:40.715 --> 33:44.072
You know, it's things that we forget
are turning points for someone else.

33:44.296 --> 33:47.020
You were a kind man,
even then.

33:48.936 --> 33:52.503
All right, we know whys he's coming to me,
but we still don't know what she wants.

33:53.145 --> 33:55.341
Well, what did
her mother say at the memorial?

33:55.655 --> 33:57.773
Her mother didn't
even know she was in the hospital.

33:58.115 --> 34:00.053
She thinks eva didn't
want her to worry.

34:00.085 --> 34:02.803
So, maybe she just wants
to apologize to her mother.

34:04.406 --> 34:06.030
I think it's
more than that.

34:06.457 --> 34:08.411
In the chapel,
when her mother was speaking,

34:08.795 --> 34:11.190
the doors blew open,
there was all this wind.

34:11.226 --> 34:13.322
You know, it was
like she didn't want her to finish.

34:13.356 --> 34:15.672
Hmm, that kind of wind
usually means that a ghost is mad,

34:15.705 --> 34:19.120
so maybe she led you to her mother,
and not just to apologize.

34:19.155 --> 34:20.203
Yeah, but what do we do?

34:20.395 --> 34:22.333
It's your ghost,
what do you think?

34:25.607 --> 34:26.993
go see her mother.

34:27.027 --> 34:31.010
Good, all right. Hopefully eva will be there
and we'll get this whole thing sorted out.

34:31.045 --> 34:32.652
Have I told you how glad
I am that you're back?

34:32.696 --> 34:33.931
You can show me.

34:39.686 --> 34:41.561
I'm very sorry for your loss.

34:42.527 --> 34:43.380
Oh, thank you.

34:44.125 --> 34:46.621
You didn't have to come all
this way just to say that.

34:47.745 --> 34:50.123
Actually, mary beth,
there's another reason we're here.

34:52.018 --> 35:00.293
This may sound strange or funny, even,
but I think... we think eva's still here.

35:00.355 --> 35:03.570
Yes, I know. She'll-she'll
always be here with us.

35:05.015 --> 35:08.450
Um, we mean literally.

35:12.745 --> 35:14.951
Heh. Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

35:15.155 --> 35:18.241
Ask her to say all those
nice things about me again.

35:20.028 --> 35:22.143
Uh, she's here.

35:28.416 --> 35:30.740
Ok, look, if you guys
are trying to comfort me,

35:31.275 --> 35:34.942
it's really not working, and, in fact,
I think it's really a little creepy, so-

35:34.985 --> 35:37.512
she wants you to say
some more nice things about her.

35:37.747 --> 35:39.320
- Yeah.
- What?

35:39.357 --> 35:40.900
I want to hear more.

35:41.428 --> 35:43.552
Except she did
leave a few things out.

35:44.585 --> 35:46.281
She's talking
about the memorial.

35:46.318 --> 35:49.191
She says that you left a few
things out when you talked about her.

35:50.098 --> 35:52.422
Oh! This is ridiculous.
I have to go.

35:52.517 --> 35:55.470
She didn't mention how she used to tell me
how I shouldn't expect too much from life

35:55.516 --> 35:57.442
because homely girl shad it hard.

35:57.768 --> 36:00.393
She feels like you criticized her.

36:04.366 --> 36:06.231
How are you doing this?

36:06.417 --> 36:10.233
- What is this?
- Eva's here with us. Right now.

36:10.918 --> 36:13.102
Why'd you do that
to me, mom?

36:13.115 --> 36:15.850
Why'd you tell me my nose
looked too big in pictures?

36:16.008 --> 36:20.341
Not that I'd ever beas beautiful as linda,
but so at least I could be presentable!

36:20.385 --> 36:22.570
She feels like
you compared her to linda.

36:23.045 --> 36:25.293
I never criticized her.

36:25.336 --> 36:29.921
Yeah, I was hard on her, but look at
the career she had because I pushed her

36:29.955 --> 36:31.850
never to be satisfied.

36:31.886 --> 36:35.263
She's just tryingto tell you that
you made her feel bad about herself.

36:35.308 --> 36:37.252
They were only words.

36:37.556 --> 36:40.342
They might have just
been words, mom, but I believed

36:40.385 --> 36:43.140
in every single one of them
because they came from you.

36:43.148 --> 36:45.321
What the hell's
going on here?

36:46.235 --> 36:49.870
Didn't you know I just wanted to
be seen as beautiful in your eyes?

36:50.926 --> 36:53.993
I tried to change erything about
myself to please you until

36:54.036 --> 36:56.782
there was nothing left
for you to criticize!

36:58.978 --> 37:01.130
She can't hear you.

37:04.005 --> 37:07.572
You said that you wanted
to change everything about yourself.

37:08.377 --> 37:11.980
You didn't goin to the hospital
to have an appendectomy, did you?

37:14.098 --> 37:16.302
Diana knows the truth.

37:17.086 --> 37:19.233
She helped me.

37:30.378 --> 37:32.991
I know you were friends
with eva back in the day,

37:33.035 --> 37:35.933
but what you're asking for
is some very private information.

37:37.616 --> 37:39.112
All right, that's true, but...

37:39.585 --> 37:43.083
it's important to me,
and to us, to her family.

37:45.057 --> 37:48.661
We think we know what happened.
We just want you to confirm it.

37:48.926 --> 37:52.050
- I don't know if it's even ethical.
- Your client's dead.

37:52.095 --> 37:55.090
If you can shed some light on that,
or give her family some closure,

37:55.135 --> 37:59.953
- how could that not be ethical?
- Did you know eva?

38:01.655 --> 38:04.370
- I've met her.
- What do you think happened?

38:04.416 --> 38:07.841
I think she went to a hospitalfor plastic
surgery and something went wrong.

38:08.698 --> 38:10.421
How did you find out?

38:10.465 --> 38:12.402
It's not important right now.

38:14.108 --> 38:17.053
I tried to tell her not to do it,
that she didn't need it,

38:17.177 --> 38:20.371
but she was never satisfied
with her looks, never.

38:20.405 --> 38:23.560
All right, but what went
wrong in the surgery?

38:24.346 --> 38:27.441
Eva was on diet pills.
She didn't tell the doctor.

38:27.477 --> 38:29.920
She had a bad reaction
to the anesthetic.

38:33.295 --> 38:37.122
Well, thank you
for being honest with us.

38:37.846 --> 38:39.982
Diana, I know that
you're trying to protect eva,

38:40.015 --> 38:41.702
but you have
to tell her family.

38:41.745 --> 38:45.363
Oh, po-why keep that wound open?
Why not just let them heal?

38:45.408 --> 38:48.521
The truth heals,
and they deserve to know.

38:51.157 --> 38:54.383
- And there's one more thing.
- What?

38:54.527 --> 38:57.342
We have to be with you
when you tell them.

38:59.938 --> 39:02.860
I can't believe
she didn't tell us about this.

39:03.067 --> 39:07.501
I'm sorry. I would have told you sooner,
but I wanted to respec ther privacy.

39:07.538 --> 39:10.631
And then melinda and jim
thought you had a right to know.

39:10.665 --> 39:13.111
I want diana to tell
my sister something.

39:13.178 --> 39:16.080
Diana, eva wants you
to tell linda something.

39:16.666 --> 39:19.521
What? I'm-I'm sorry?
What is this?

39:19.557 --> 39:21.202
She's here with us.

39:21.337 --> 39:23.230
What is she talking about?

39:23.696 --> 39:26.183
She wants you to tell linda
about the pills.

39:26.225 --> 39:27.831
Well, I-yeah,
I told you.

39:28.547 --> 39:30.641
She was on diet pills,
and she forgot to tell-

39:30.675 --> 39:32.132
she didn't tell the doctor.

39:32.175 --> 39:34.602
And diana told men
ot to tell him.

39:34.878 --> 39:37.793
She told me he wouldn't
do the surgery if he knew.

39:38.388 --> 39:40.790
You told her that the doctor
would refuse the operation

39:40.835 --> 39:43.001
if he knew about the pills.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.840
And it was the pills
and the anesthesia that killed her.

39:45.885 --> 39:48.651
You also told her that
it would add 10 years to her career.

39:48.686 --> 39:51.382
Excuse me, are you trying
to blame me for this?

39:51.415 --> 39:54.243
She wanted that surgery.
She wanted it.

39:54.827 --> 39:57.090
She's not trying
to blame anyone.

39:57.486 --> 40:00.182
I just don't
want my sister to buy into this.

40:00.456 --> 40:02.510
I don't want her
to listen to diana.

40:02.528 --> 40:04.490
She's worried about you.

40:04.526 --> 40:08.182
She doesn't want you
to listen to diana or anyone.

40:08.226 --> 40:11.530
Just... listen to yourself.

40:12.947 --> 40:15.363
But I wanted
to be like eva.

40:15.397 --> 40:17.771
That's all I was
trying to do.

40:18.268 --> 40:20.183
She overcame everything.

40:20.228 --> 40:22.450
I overcame nothing.

40:22.647 --> 40:25.431
I never looked inside.

40:25.867 --> 40:29.561
I turned myself into
what other people wanted me to be.

40:29.595 --> 40:33.441
She's saying
that she hasn't overcome anything.

40:33.507 --> 40:36.593
She just became
who other people wanted her to be.

40:36.636 --> 40:39.090
No, that's not true.

40:39.746 --> 40:41.733
When I realized
I was dead,

40:42.027 --> 40:47.981
I didn't remember the money or the
magazines or even my own face.

40:51.267 --> 40:56.072
I remembered that one sweet
moment at the high school dance.

40:58.557 --> 41:06.210
And when she dies, I want her to leave
behind a life full of real things.

41:07.047 --> 41:09.681
I want her to live
from the inside.

41:12.138 --> 41:16.390
- Can you tell her that?
- I promise.

41:20.385 --> 41:23.333
Is that where
I'm supposed to go?

41:24.475 --> 41:26.211
She sees the light.

41:26.866 --> 41:29.321
She's ready to cross over now.

41:29.367 --> 41:31.792
She's here, I can feel her.

41:32.888 --> 41:35.300
She's gonna be ok.

41:35.336 --> 41:37.042
Yes, she is.

41:42.607 --> 41:44.873
Eva, for whatever
its worth...

41:45.947 --> 41:51.842
I spoke to your mother at the memorial
service and... I saw how much she loved you.

41:52.037 --> 41:55.171
How proud she was
of you, I saw it in her eyes.

41:56.205 --> 41:57.802
It was real.

42:00.637 --> 42:03.660
Well, it's time to say good-bye.

42:06.215 --> 42:08.441
Take care, eva.

42:31.467 --> 42:33.202
Well...

42:34.937 --> 42:37.392
I think that you and i should talk.

42:37.437 --> 42:38.560
Please.

42:45.245 --> 42:50.160
You know, I've said it before,
and I'll say it again.

42:51.086 --> 42:55.213
I don't know
how you do this on a daily basis.

42:55.368 --> 43:00.051
I feel like
I need to lie down for 6 weeks.

43:00.098 --> 43:03.071
Yeah, well, my ghosts
aren't quite as fascinating as yours.

43:03.115 --> 43:04.621
Oh, yeah, fascinating.

43:04.908 --> 43:08.440
I'm sure am gonna
miss the beetles and the scalpels.

43:08.485 --> 43:11.221
Oh, and the tearing off
of faces, I'll agree.

43:11.258 --> 43:13.962
Oh, well. At least
she was easy on the eyes.

43:13.995 --> 43:15.932
Yep. That she was.

43:23.787 --> 43:26.073
But the most
beautiful woman in my world...

43:27.178 --> 43:28.970
is right here.

43:30.198 --> 43:32.711
She's pretty
easy on the eyes.

43:34.205 --> 43:36.833
Welcome home,
dream girl.

43:37.205 --> 43:38.240
Come here.
