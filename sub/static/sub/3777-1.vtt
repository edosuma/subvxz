  Legend has it, that when the
         moon's full...

00:34.101 --> 00:37.169
   ...you can still spot ole
          Pitchfork...

00:38.072 --> 00:40.472
    ...wandering the woods.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.383
 Young Corey: My dad says we're
    not suppose to play back
            here...

01:24.385 --> 01:26.385
   ...He says a monster lives
             here.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.396
              Run!

02:08.395 --> 02:10.628
  You shoulda seen your face.

02:43.364 --> 02:46.465
  Wincer: It's the worst thing
        I've ever seen.

03:10.357 --> 03:14.826
 There's a legend around here,
that a farmer killed his family.

04:01.642 --> 04:08.046
    Morgan: If you mess with
  Rayborn's daughter, you mess
      with the pitchfork.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.554
  This is right outside of out
           perimeter.

04:15.556 --> 04:16.988
Does anybody live out this way?

04:16.991 --> 04:17.889
       I don't think so.

04:23.230 --> 04:26.164
            (Cheers)

       (Chainsaw engine)

04:39.747 --> 04:44.650
           (Screams)

04:58.265 --> 05:00.132
         Run! Run! Run!

05:14.248 --> 05:15.414
            No! No!

05:15.949 --> 05:17.382
        (Scream in pain)

06:23.550 --> 06:25.550
     Who the hell is that?

06:29.056 --> 06:31.022
      I know who that is.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.579
             Sorry.

07:23.744 --> 07:26.745
        (Radio chatter)

07:39.393 --> 07:41.259
   This shit doesn't happen.

07:43.597 --> 07:50.569
  I mean we caught the fucking
    Boogie Man, or Dracula,
  or hell, the devil himself.

07:50.571 --> 07:54.673
You understand what I'm saying?
 - Yeah, you guys grow 'em big,
   and you grow 'em crazy...

07:54.675 --> 07:55.640
      I'll give you that.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.176
   Nah, it's more than that.

08:00.614 --> 08:04.115
 Did you ever play that Bloody
 Mary game when you were kids?

08:04.651 --> 08:06.985
 What where you stare into the
    mirror and say her name?

08:07.554 --> 08:08.353
             Yeah.

08:08.722 --> 08:09.621
          Yeah, sure.

08:10.757 --> 08:13.191
 Did she ever come to life and
    start murdering people?

08:15.829 --> 08:18.497
      I'm not trying to be
     insensitive, I'm not.

08:18.499 --> 08:19.798
       It's just that...

08:21.869 --> 08:23.568
when we was kids, growing up...

08:24.137 --> 08:26.505
       He's the reason we
    didn't playin the woods.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.075
       Those stories you
       tell each other...

08:30.077 --> 08:32.644
  trying to keep each other up
    late at night at camp...

08:32.645 --> 08:35.380
        were about him.
     - When you were a kid?

08:35.381 --> 08:39.217
             Yeah.
  - Dang. That dude looks good
      for like, a hundred.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.619
              Ha!

08:41.655 --> 08:44.121
 I might have been a teenager,
     but you get my point.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.558
  Why were you still going to
      camp as a teenager?

08:46.960 --> 08:49.694
 It was vacation bible school.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.831
       That's not weird!

08:59.373 --> 09:03.375
    You know I saw him once,
      or I thought I did.

09:05.412 --> 09:08.713
      We were working late
       on Christmas Eve.

09:09.283 --> 09:12.584
     Car wreck, completely
      engulfed in flames.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.586
      Couple lost control.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.323
    Well it just felt weird.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.694
   I don't know if it was the
      wind or the cold...

09:22.696 --> 09:25.730
  or it was Christmas Eve and
I just didn't want to be there.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.507
    (On Radio): Hey Wincer,
         what you got?

09:39.079 --> 09:41.112
     I didn't really think
        about it then...

09:41.114 --> 09:43.848
      but on the way home,
       from the scene...

09:43.850 --> 09:47.619
       I passed right by
     the old Rayborn place.

09:48.855 --> 09:51.656
 Well, I wouldn't have admitted
   then, but I'll tell you...

09:51.658 --> 09:53.959
  scared the shit out of me...

09:53.961 --> 09:56.394
    that some fucking crazy,
           old hermit

09:56.396 --> 10:00.398
would've been that close to me,
    in the dark, at night...

10:00.934 --> 10:03.168
   well, it'd scare anybody.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.304
   Was Rayborn his real name?

10:06.740 --> 10:08.773
             Yeah.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.711
 'Til they started calling him
           Pitchfork.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.088
Hey, if they can keep him alive,
  you're gonna need to put...

10:23.090 --> 10:25.056
 ...a small army on his floor.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.658
         Yeah, no shit.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.627
Yeah, media's gonna be a bitch.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.629
      I thought you meant
        if he wakes up.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.232
  I don't believe in monsters.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.003
             Fuck!

10:40.440 --> 10:43.208
          (Screaming)

10:49.883 --> 10:52.217
          (Screaming)

11:03.063 --> 11:05.930
           (Grunting)

11:36.363 --> 11:38.396
       Morgan: Let me ask
        you something...

11:38.398 --> 11:40.865
     what do you think the
   chances are that Steven...

11:40.867 --> 11:43.368
      would come work with
     us down on the boats?

11:43.370 --> 11:44.569
            (Laughs)

11:44.571 --> 11:46.571
   Well, let's see after you
        sold half our...

11:46.573 --> 11:48.573
      ...gear to send him
        off to college.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.608
Yeah. Does he have to know that?

11:53.747 --> 11:55.814
  Morgan: It's good to see you
   boys back together again.

11:57.084 --> 12:00.218
       You know I'd sell
     everything I own if...

12:00.220 --> 12:02.220
     I thought there was a
       chance in hell...

12:02.222 --> 12:04.689
   you'd wise up and get the
       hell out of here.

12:04.691 --> 12:07.192
     Bring it on, alright.
         Alright buddy.

12:12.232 --> 12:16.935
  (Whispering) They said like
  25 dead, including his dad.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.838
  Oh my God. That's terrible.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.108
       Make sure you give
     that to Dr. Shapiro...

12:23.110 --> 12:26.010
      he needs it as soon
      as you can. Thanks.

12:31.184 --> 12:35.787
      (Paramedic coughing)

12:45.532 --> 12:48.900
           (Coughing)

14:04.010 --> 14:07.111
             (Sobs)

14:29.502 --> 14:32.337
  Steven hasn't come out yet?

14:33.106 --> 14:35.039
            Not yet.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.676
         He'll be fine.

14:40.780 --> 14:45.083
  We use to play pretty rough
    when we were kids, so...

14:45.085 --> 14:47.719
          he knows how
       to take a beating.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.657
            (Laughs)

14:54.828 --> 14:59.898
     I saw him tear up from
        a splinter once.

15:02.168 --> 15:09.908
               Â¶

15:10.143 --> 15:12.911
    Tiburon: It's called the
       Day of the Dead...

15:12.913 --> 15:17.315
    (Speaking spanish), it's
     a time to remember...

15:17.317 --> 15:19.350
 those that we've lost, and...

15:19.486 --> 15:21.853
     the ones who have gone
         on before us.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.521
    I've seen that on TV and
             stuff

15:23.523 --> 15:25.823
 it's like a scary Mardi Gras,
             right?

15:28.261 --> 15:31.963
       Yeah, pretty much.

15:35.669 --> 15:36.868
            (Laughs)

15:36.870 --> 15:38.503
      They didn't let you
       have the day off?

15:39.673 --> 15:41.172
         I did not ask.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.742
     Man, if I was Mexican,
  I wouldn't be working zombie
          Mardi Gras.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.047
You know, that is disrespectful.

15:49.049 --> 15:55.453
It's a celebration of a passing
 soul and to remind us that...

15:55.455 --> 16:00.858
   life is just a dream, and
     death is when we wake.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.195
       That's beautiful.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.599
           Thank you.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.736
   But, you have parades and
     throw candy too right?

16:11.738 --> 16:13.438
       That's Mardi Gras.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.440
        Woah woah, hey!

16:16.242 --> 16:17.241
             Yeah?

16:17.243 --> 16:18.309
        Where ya headed?

16:18.478 --> 16:20.311
    Second floor, what's up?

16:20.313 --> 16:21.612
         Is it urgent?

16:21.614 --> 16:23.881
       Man, I'm at work!

16:23.883 --> 16:27.952
      You got a minute to
        conference call?

16:28.288 --> 16:30.455
 Didn't your ass just go smoke?

16:30.457 --> 16:32.757
        Maybe, slow day.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.828
You know, one of these days they
  gon' catch on to the fact...

16:36.830 --> 16:39.130
    that you don't do shit!

16:39.132 --> 16:42.133
            (Laughs)
      Yeah. Maybe, maybe.

16:42.135 --> 16:46.371
Alright man, you twisted my arm.
    Yo Tiburon, you coming?

16:46.373 --> 16:50.008
    Oh no, I get to get back
      to these checklists.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.643
      Alright well, don't
      work too hard, man.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.079
         He won't, it's
      mexican Mardi Gras.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.382
            No shit?
       - I shit you not.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.384
            Gringos.

17:04.891 --> 17:05.957
           (Laughing)

17:06.159 --> 17:07.925
   Mardi Gras, Cinco de Mayo,
      they got everything.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.228
   Hey man look, who was that
    they brought in earlier?

17:11.263 --> 17:12.896
    I don't know. They came
      in through the back.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.866
       Through the morgue
        entrance right?

17:14.867 --> 17:15.532
             Yeah.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.567
              Why?

17:16.569 --> 17:18.435
         I don't know.

17:18.438 --> 17:21.239
  They did that shit that last
 time the mayor got his DUI...

17:21.407 --> 17:23.241
         snuck his ass
      through the back...

17:23.242 --> 17:25.343
    like I wasn't suppose to
       know who he is...

17:25.345 --> 17:27.244
      shit, I know who the
      fuck he is. Ah Shit!

17:27.247 --> 17:28.179
             What?

17:28.181 --> 17:29.280
 Man, I gotta go back to the...

17:29.282 --> 17:30.615
   break room, get my smokes.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.116
    I'll bum you one, c'mon.

17:32.118 --> 17:36.254
          Hell no man!
         You smoke that
      nasty menthol crap.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.623
              So?
             - So?!

17:38.625 --> 17:42.493
Dude that's full of fiberglass.
        That shit's way
       worse for you man.

17:42.495 --> 17:46.564
    Oh. So it's more deadly
       than just smoking?
             Idiot.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.682
          (Door Slams)
            (Grunts)

18:07.020 --> 18:10.855
       (Noise continues)

18:32.612 --> 18:33.778
             Shit.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.120
         (Violent thud)

19:01.641 --> 19:03.708
           Oh, sorry.
          - It's okay.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.382
           You okay?

19:13.987 --> 19:16.087
      Said might have some
        nerve damage...

19:16.856 --> 19:17.889
      physical therapy...

19:18.658 --> 19:23.694
          It'll be ok.
        Baby, baby, it's
         fine, really.

19:23.696 --> 19:26.063
        Said it could've
        been alot worse.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.267
       Has anyone checked
          you out yet?

19:29.702 --> 19:31.836
          Not really.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.506
       They want to check
      for a heartbeat, so.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.242
   Did they do your CAT scan?

19:38.244 --> 19:40.144
          No, not yet.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.246
        Checking you for
        "dain bramage?"

19:42.248 --> 19:45.316
            (Laughs)
      New "dain bramage."

19:47.320 --> 19:49.987
     Have you..had a chance
     to talk to anyone yet?

19:51.191 --> 19:52.924
         No, I gotta...

19:53.693 --> 19:56.160
          go down and
      identify the... umm.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.872
            Amanda?

20:12.812 --> 20:15.146
  They towed that truck out of
    here about an hour ago.

20:15.949 --> 20:17.682
 You know a bunch of kids head
  out here for some thrills...

20:17.684 --> 20:19.717
       and end up in this
    crazy fucking nightmare.

20:20.620 --> 20:24.488
 Whole thing turns my stomach.
      - You see that poor
     bastard in the woods?

20:24.490 --> 20:26.390
        With the fucking
       thing on his face?
            - Yeah.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.659
       Yeah, I saw it...

20:28.661 --> 20:30.695
  I don't fucking believe it.

20:31.297 --> 20:32.230
       I mean honestly...

20:32.532 --> 20:34.131
       have you ever seen
      anything like this?

20:36.236 --> 20:39.303
     Man, there ain't ever
    been anything like this.

20:44.177 --> 20:45.343
          Lt. Dayton?

20:46.679 --> 20:47.578
             Yeah?

20:47.580 --> 20:51.749
    The city guys posted at
       the hospital said
 the ambulance isn't there yet.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.652
You sure? They told everyone to
  else use the back entrance.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.721
        He said they're
      covering both sides.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.923
      They never made it.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.595
    Ole Wincer could fuck up
 a cup of coffee, couldn't he?

21:04.597 --> 21:06.664
  I'll tell you what, you tell
      them to stay put...

21:06.665 --> 21:08.732
   in case they radio in, you
     follow me up the nine,
 see if we can chase them down.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.735
     'Til we locate Wincer
    everyone reports to me.

21:41.267 --> 21:43.934
       Wasn't sure if you
     were a coffee drinker.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.736
      Only if it's Irish.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.206
            Thanks.

21:56.616 --> 21:57.515
          You know...

21:58.451 --> 22:00.885
  I remember you from school.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.120
           Fairhope?

22:05.325 --> 22:08.059
          Go Pirates.

22:10.763 --> 22:13.531
 Yeah, you were a couple grades
     ahead of me, but I...

22:13.966 --> 22:15.499
        I saw you in the
        halls and stuff.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.568
  You were in Steven's grade.

22:17.570 --> 22:18.469
             Yeah.

22:21.307 --> 22:24.275
      I didn't know him or
      anything, I just...

22:25.878 --> 22:28.145
    Small school, you know?

22:28.581 --> 22:31.215
          Yeah, tiny.

22:35.254 --> 22:38.155
   You...you left before the
   year was over, didn't you?

22:43.563 --> 22:45.596
  I'm not a stalker I promise,
              I...

22:46.099 --> 22:47.598
          I just, uh.

22:47.600 --> 22:52.737
  Yeah, I dropped out to help
      my dad on his boat.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.805
       He was gonna lose
        it to the bank.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.177
           I never...

23:04.384 --> 23:05.316
             So...

23:06.119 --> 23:09.353
     your dad, I mean he...

23:11.391 --> 23:13.190
             Yeah.

23:17.296 --> 23:18.796
              I...

23:19.899 --> 23:21.632
          I wasn't...

23:24.036 --> 23:25.936
           I'm sorry.

23:28.374 --> 23:30.441
      I wasn't even there.

23:34.714 --> 23:37.047
 Do you want to talk about it?

23:39.786 --> 23:41.318
      I just want answers.

23:42.555 --> 23:46.090
   The police are telling us
     two different things.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.593
   It doesn't make any sense.

23:56.369 --> 23:58.369
          You know...

23:58.671 --> 24:01.105
      I've been here for a
      couple of years now.

24:02.575 --> 24:06.277
     And I've seen alot of
   people dealing with loss.

24:06.679 --> 24:07.978
             But...

24:09.615 --> 24:11.816
    nothing quite like this.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.621
 Whenever there's a tragedy...

24:20.993 --> 24:25.830
      It's always so hard
       on the survivors.

24:28.768 --> 24:31.335
        And I don't just
       mean the families.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.239
       I mean the people
      who were involved...

24:36.976 --> 24:40.010
      who could've just as
      easily not made it.

24:46.118 --> 24:52.189
   Not only do you have this
     pain and loss, but...

24:54.360 --> 24:57.795
      but you can get a...

24:57.797 --> 25:00.598
   guilt that comes with it.

25:05.505 --> 25:08.272
  Sometimes it's hard to find.

25:27.593 --> 25:30.261
  It's hard to be a survivor.

25:34.367 --> 25:37.835
    It starts to feel easier
       just to give up...

25:40.940 --> 25:43.741
    but you can't, you know?

25:45.511 --> 25:48.779
Mary: You have to keep fighting.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.383
     (Heartbeat on monitor)
          There it is.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.859
   Sounds really strong too.

26:02.962 --> 26:05.029
  I'll give you two a minute.

26:11.771 --> 26:14.138
 I don't mean to be intrusive.

26:14.473 --> 26:17.541
   No, my dad would have told
     me to suck it up too.

26:19.111 --> 26:23.147
    That's not exactly what
         I was saying.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.782
            I know.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.784
         (Phone rings)

26:29.188 --> 26:31.555
    I have to deal with the
 families that come in here...

26:31.557 --> 26:33.591
      all the time and...

26:35.061 --> 26:37.428
    it's never easy for the
       one that made it.

26:41.467 --> 26:45.135
   (Phone ringing continues)

26:45.137 --> 26:48.272
     If you need anyone to
     talk to or anything...

26:48.474 --> 26:51.642
        I work until 10.

26:55.514 --> 26:57.314
            Thanks.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.352
   (Phone ringing continues)

27:13.766 --> 27:17.501
        Hi, front desk.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.505
     Down in the archives?

27:22.174 --> 27:24.942
      Ok, sure, what file?

27:26.178 --> 27:29.346
     Ok, yeah it'll just be
      a couple of minutes.

27:31.484 --> 27:34.051
   On TV: Hey boys and girls,
      it's Captain Morgan.

27:34.053 --> 27:35.853
  And you know what, it's that
      time of year for...

27:35.855 --> 27:38.922
        Captain Morgan's
        Haunted Hayride.

27:39.692 --> 27:41.425
 We got werewolves, we got ...

27:41.427 --> 27:43.427
    zombies, we got headless
     people running all...

27:43.429 --> 27:44.695
         we got it all!

27:44.830 --> 27:48.866
So, come on down Friday the 30th
    and Saturday the 31st...

27:48.868 --> 27:51.702
 that's Halloween night and if
     you're brave enough...

27:51.704 --> 27:55.005
     to ride in our ride of
     terror and survive...

27:55.007 --> 27:58.175
  well then you might just get
       to meet Pitchfork.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.044
      Pitchfork, himself!

28:01.514 --> 28:03.147
 Make sure you bring the kids!

28:03.149 --> 28:05.182
      (Laughs maniacally)

29:45.384 --> 29:47.751
            No! No!

29:50.890 --> 29:52.923
       (Screams in agony)

30:28.327 --> 30:29.293
          Feel better?

30:30.062 --> 30:31.862
          Not really.

30:32.097 --> 30:34.665
    I mean, about the baby,
       little Steven, Jr.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.234
         You mean Lily.

30:37.236 --> 30:39.236
             Lily?!

30:39.238 --> 30:40.804
   Yeah, you don't like Lily?

30:40.806 --> 30:42.472
        I really don't.

30:42.975 --> 30:45.242
       This is gonna be a
       problem isn't it?

30:45.244 --> 30:47.177
   I can almost guarantee it.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.484
 We're not naming our son Lily.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.386
          (Both laugh)

30:57.957 --> 31:01.491
     Sorry Mr. Summers, the
    doctor will see you now.

31:10.836 --> 31:12.903
           Love you.
        - Love you too.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.003
    (Metal door swings open)

36:33.458 --> 36:37.127
      (Screams) Oh my god!
        - Sorry, sorry.
   Oh, my god! You scared me.

36:37.129 --> 36:41.831
     Yeah...I thought I was
      going the wrong way.

36:41.833 --> 36:44.100
        Where ya headed?

36:44.101 --> 36:46.368
         Waiting room.
  - No, that's the right way.
 Everything just looks kinda...

36:46.371 --> 36:48.638
        messed up cause
      they're remodeling.

36:48.640 --> 36:52.709
  Tax dollars at work I guess.
   - Alright, thanks...sorry.

37:01.587 --> 37:02.452
        (Muffled shriek)

37:13.532 --> 37:14.564
           (Screams)

37:36.688 --> 37:37.821
              Hey!

37:37.956 --> 37:39.222
             Corey!

37:39.458 --> 37:41.224
       Hey, put her down!

37:41.927 --> 37:43.226
            Rayborn!

38:47.292 --> 38:49.192
Security Guard: Drop the knife!

38:50.228 --> 38:51.795
        Drop the knife!

38:53.498 --> 38:55.699
       Drop the knife you
     motherfucker drop it!

39:00.238 --> 39:02.906
           (Gunshots)

39:50.422 --> 39:53.423
   Ma'am, I'm gonna need you
   to stay back, let's go...

39:53.425 --> 39:57.627
  come on, nothing to see down
    here, let's go, come on.

40:09.007 --> 40:12.542
Sir get back in the waiting room
 until we've secured the area.

40:12.544 --> 40:16.112
        Corey. That's my
        fucking brother!

40:19.885 --> 40:21.985
         Are you okay?

40:22.654 --> 40:26.723
        I tried Steven.
            - Tried?

40:30.629 --> 40:32.529
        Where's Amanda?

40:35.834 --> 40:38.568
      Alright, I know you
        boys are tired.

40:39.671 --> 40:43.740
 It's been a long fucking day.
      Some of you been on
       24 hours already.

40:46.912 --> 40:48.578
 ER Doctor: Ok, what do we got?

40:48.580 --> 40:51.147
45 year old male, unresponsive,
    motor vehicle accident.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.518
    But, I don't wanna hear
    about that right now...

40:55.520 --> 40:59.656
 and I don't want to hear about
   the Boogeyman, monsters...

40:59.658 --> 41:01.691
    or spook stories either.

41:02.861 --> 41:06.196
  Local legends, no matter how
 many times we've heard them...

41:06.198 --> 41:08.231
    are still just legends.

41:22.013 --> 41:26.683
What I need you concentrating on
 is finding that little girl...

41:26.685 --> 41:29.419
    and bringing that son of
      bitch to his knees.

41:29.421 --> 41:31.421
     Now she's got a family
     that's missing her...

41:31.423 --> 41:33.423
        people that are
      worried about her...

41:33.425 --> 41:35.892
   now I know I don't need to
tell you, this guy's already...

41:35.894 --> 41:37.927
    taken the lives of some
        of our brothers.

41:48.139 --> 41:51.641
    So you keep that in mind
     when you run into him.

41:57.649 --> 42:01.117
   I remember when you first
    came to live with us...

42:03.221 --> 42:07.724
     dad told me it was my
   job to take care of you...

42:07.726 --> 42:09.959
      cause I was bigger.

42:09.961 --> 42:13.196
I remember this stormy night...

42:13.198 --> 42:16.065
     ...after the ride and
     you couldn't sleep...

42:17.435 --> 42:23.506
  so we sat on the porch with
dad, watched him finish a sixer

42:23.508 --> 42:29.746
 and just listened to the rain.

42:29.748 --> 42:36.119
      You asked dad if he
   ever got scared, remember?

42:37.422 --> 42:41.457
   You remember what he said?

42:54.072 --> 43:00.243
 I wanna tell y'all something.
  Every man on this planet is
gonna have to face his demons...

43:00.245 --> 43:02.245
       and his monsters.

43:02.247 --> 43:09.319
 Now demons are tough, because
 they come from inside of you.

43:10.488 --> 43:14.057
         Now monsters,
    completely different...

43:14.059 --> 43:17.594
       the only monsters
      you have to fear...

43:17.963 --> 43:21.764
       are the ones that
       walk on two legs.

43:28.139 --> 43:33.042
      I remember thinking
    it was my job to protect
     you from the monsters.

43:33.945 --> 43:36.546
   I never expected anything.

43:39.618 --> 43:44.220
You may not be my little brother
  but you might as well be...

43:45.991 --> 43:48.424
        and it's my job
       to protect you...

43:50.528 --> 43:53.429
         and I'm sorry.

46:50.041 --> 46:52.375
           (Screams)

47:11.663 --> 47:16.199
Nurse: I think he's gonna be ok.
            - Yeah.

47:16.201 --> 47:19.268
       Did they find that
       missing girl yet?
            - Nope.

47:21.639 --> 47:24.740
      I sure hope they do.
        Bless her heart.

47:35.987 --> 47:41.224
     Hey, hey, no no let...
    - What did you do to me?

47:41.226 --> 47:46.295
Just save your life, that's all.
  - Then why does my ass hurt?

47:50.001 --> 47:57.073
      Hey, did we get him?
  - No, he got a little girl.

47:58.443 --> 47:59.575
        Ah, we gotta...

47:59.577 --> 48:02.979
       You just rest man
      let them handle it.

48:04.015 --> 48:06.682
      Don't underestimate
        this guy again.

48:08.253 --> 48:12.855
   There's a reason that some
    stories become legends.

48:12.857 --> 48:16.492
We will get him, you just rest.

48:16.694 --> 48:20.029
 I'd feel better about this if
    you were in play on it.

48:20.999 --> 48:24.467
   Yeah, I'm working on that.

48:26.037 --> 48:27.103
     Nurse: Officer Loomis?

48:27.105 --> 48:27.904
              Yes.

48:27.906 --> 48:29.572
   Somebody's here to see you

48:29.574 --> 48:30.673
            Thanks.

48:42.387 --> 48:43.352
        What'd you get?

48:43.354 --> 48:44.353
    Everything I could find.

48:44.589 --> 48:45.521
            Perfect.

48:45.790 --> 48:47.590
      It's only for Wincer
        that I do this.

48:47.592 --> 48:49.525
  If you get caught with this
  I'll tell them you stole it.

48:49.727 --> 48:52.929
Hey, black man from out of town,
    I'm sure they'll buy it.

48:53.598 --> 48:54.931
      I'm sure they will.

48:55.767 --> 48:57.466
What are you looking for anyway?

48:57.468 --> 48:59.135
   I mean no offense, but...

48:59.137 --> 49:01.470
     the convict, that was
      your jurisdiction...

49:01.472 --> 49:03.439
   this is a whole new thing.

49:03.441 --> 49:05.007
      Just trying to help.

49:07.312 --> 49:09.045
    You need to be careful.

49:09.747 --> 49:12.081
   Listen, it's my fault that
       Wincer got hurt...

49:12.083 --> 49:13.616
       so I'm gonna help
         any way I can.

49:13.785 --> 49:16.118
 And I've heard enough word of
mouth stories about this guy...

49:16.120 --> 49:19.522
    I do not care about the
   campfire version anymore.

49:19.991 --> 49:21.791
        In this case...

49:21.793 --> 49:23.893
  I think it's the same thing.

50:55.153 --> 50:58.087
  Our investigation indicates
    that Ms. Rayborn left...

50:58.089 --> 51:03.459
     of her own free will.
  Apparently, with a young man
 she had been seeing secretly.

51:03.461 --> 51:08.164
       Frankly, given her
 home environment, I'm glad she
       finally got away.

51:08.166 --> 51:10.199
           Thank you.

51:54.412 --> 51:56.445
   (On radio) This is Dayton.

51:59.283 --> 52:01.617
  I think we found her sir...

52:01.619 --> 52:03.619
           the girl.

52:14.031 --> 52:16.165
  Dayton: I want every officer
hat's not watching that house...

52:16.367 --> 52:19.034
      walking these woods,
          high alert.

52:19.737 --> 52:22.304
  This is ground zero, we fan
   out from this location...

52:22.306 --> 52:25.708
  and we go in every direction
   until we find the fucker.
         Now let's go!

52:25.710 --> 52:27.576
    Let's move! Let's move!
          Let's move!

52:29.447 --> 52:30.513
            Mooney.

52:31.315 --> 52:33.883
  This is Dayton, we're gonna
       set up a new grid.

52:33.885 --> 52:35.217
        Figure that out.

53:01.812 --> 53:03.812
       Loomis: Endurance.

53:05.716 --> 53:08.784
     I asked my father what
     a lifetime as a police
      officer taught him.

53:09.987 --> 53:12.321
That's what he said, endurance.

53:16.160 --> 53:18.761
      He said that in the
    aftermath of tragedy...

53:18.763 --> 53:21.897
     endurance is our only
  contribution to one another.

53:22.033 --> 53:24.633
     Because, we can endure
     what they can't right?

53:25.036 --> 53:28.003
  We're not directly involved.

53:30.107 --> 53:32.174
      But he never had to
    face anything like this.

53:34.912 --> 53:38.080
       He's right though,
   endurance is all we have.

53:39.817 --> 53:43.085
 Sometimes the families of the
   victims turn against us...

53:43.087 --> 53:45.321
      'cause it makes them
          feel better.

53:45.323 --> 53:47.323
     And if it does, great.

53:48.292 --> 53:50.993
      We've done our job.

53:50.995 --> 53:54.930
     Now, this Dayton, he's
     an arrogant asshole...

53:55.299 --> 53:58.701
  but he's a motivated asshole
and he will hunt this guy down.

53:59.337 --> 54:03.505
  I'm sure this is the resume
 builder he's been waiting for.

54:05.176 --> 54:06.408
       Did you read this?

54:08.312 --> 54:11.547
   Yeah, interesting read but
    nothing really to go on.

54:12.950 --> 54:14.383
  Yeah, now you know why these
   stories are so popular...

54:14.385 --> 54:16.018
   with the kids around here.

54:16.020 --> 54:18.887
    No, I became a believer
         this morning.

54:19.223 --> 54:21.223
     Sometimes you hear so
      much of this shit...

54:21.659 --> 54:24.627
       you forget it all
   started with real people.

54:28.633 --> 54:30.032
            Oh fuck.

54:32.336 --> 54:33.936
        Where's the kid?

54:36.240 --> 54:37.973
           What kid?

54:39.277 --> 54:41.377
      Easy, I don't think
      that's a good idea.

54:41.379 --> 54:43.279
    I've been sitting on my
        ass long enough.

54:57.695 --> 54:59.228
         Mind if I sit?

55:02.533 --> 55:05.734
  We don't feel like answering
    any questions right now.

55:08.005 --> 55:10.906
  I don't have any questions.

55:12.176 --> 55:13.909
  I don't know where to start.

55:15.413 --> 55:17.579
       12 years ago I was
       working a wreck...

55:18.616 --> 55:21.684
  near here on Christmas Eve.

55:25.923 --> 55:27.423
There wasn't much we could do...

55:27.658 --> 55:30.426
  just waiting around for the
  fire department to show up.

55:33.864 --> 55:37.666
   The hardest part of my job
      is notifying family.

55:56.187 --> 55:59.822
 Your uncle was suppose to meet
   your parents in Atlanta...

56:00.091 --> 56:02.858
        but instead, he
       brought you here.

56:08.432 --> 56:11.133
     They let me go out on
       the boat with him.

56:18.876 --> 56:22.978
 We go back early so he brought
me here instead of meeting them.

56:25.516 --> 56:27.583
    My parents were pissed.

56:29.387 --> 56:31.387
      They hated it here.

56:32.056 --> 56:33.389
   Son they didn't hate it...

56:33.724 --> 56:35.391
    they were scared of it.

57:04.588 --> 57:08.223
        Yeah, Detective
       Loomis for Dayton.

57:08.492 --> 57:11.059
       What the hell's he
     doing on Brewer Road?

57:11.061 --> 57:14.062
 Dammit, get him off there he's
not doing us any good up there.

57:14.765 --> 57:17.232
        This is Dayton.

57:18.702 --> 57:20.302
    Yeah, patch him through.

57:22.473 --> 57:24.072
      Dayton, it's Loomis.

57:24.074 --> 57:27.042
     Hey there city, how's
      our boy holding up?

57:27.812 --> 57:29.645
 Yeah, I'm looking at it now...

57:30.414 --> 57:32.448
   figure if he's a hermit he
   might show up back here...

57:32.450 --> 57:34.416
        but trust me, we
     searched that house...

57:34.418 --> 57:36.418
    I got forensics sniffing
   around he's not in there.

57:36.420 --> 57:37.653
          No, listen.

57:38.456 --> 57:40.656
      Dayton, listen there
         is more to it.

57:41.058 --> 57:43.892
 Look, as soon as Wincer starts
 feeling better you boys are...

57:43.894 --> 57:46.662
 welcome to take a little walk
down here and see for yourselves

57:46.664 --> 57:48.163
        but until then I
     gotta get back to it.

57:48.165 --> 57:51.133
    No, listen dammit you've
      gotta look under it!

57:51.135 --> 57:52.634
    There's a cellar you...

57:54.672 --> 57:56.338
             Hello?

57:57.341 --> 57:58.307
             Fuck!

58:21.532 --> 58:24.199
   Forensics: I'd say time of
 death was sometime yesterday.

58:24.201 --> 58:26.168
Ground's still dry under it too.

58:43.087 --> 58:45.020
         That's my mom.

58:51.762 --> 58:54.263
   I've never seen a picture
   of her this young before.

58:54.265 --> 58:57.299
  That picture is from an old
police report from our station.

58:58.269 --> 59:00.636
    She was the center of a
   missing persons search...

59:00.638 --> 59:02.638
  when she was about that age.

59:03.574 --> 59:04.640
             No...

59:06.777 --> 59:09.611
       Dad was from here,
      she lived up north.

59:09.613 --> 59:13.215
 Your dad and your mom had run
away from her abusive father...

59:13.217 --> 59:17.686
  a farmer who lived near here
    by the name of Rayborn.

59:21.892 --> 59:28.397
  Your father probably didn't
    know anything about it.
    He was just a baby then.

59:28.399 --> 59:31.800
    He and uncle Mike didn't
      grow up together...

59:32.236 --> 59:35.704
 they didn't get together until
    Steven and I were born.

59:37.508 --> 59:40.776
  But that's not the story my
      father use to tell.

59:41.412 --> 59:43.612
   That's not what I believe.

59:44.682 --> 59:47.015
Your parents probably wanted you
 as far away from that past...

59:47.017 --> 59:48.417
          as possible.

59:48.419 --> 59:50.118
         Do you know...

59:53.857 --> 59:57.392
  Do you know for sure that my
    parent's accident was...

59:58.395 --> 01:00:00.395
            I don't.

01:00:02.866 --> 01:00:05.601
They know not to come back here.

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:10.105
They avoided this place like the
   fucking curse that it is.

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:16.278
  They only came back for me.

01:00:22.186 --> 01:00:24.786
 (On radio) Officer: Hey boss.

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:26.121
     Dayton: Yeah go ahead.

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:28.991
  This ain't the chick that's
       missing over here.

01:00:30.227 --> 01:00:32.127
What the fuck you talking about?

01:00:32.363 --> 01:00:35.497
   CSI is saying this girl's
 been dead a day, maybe longer.

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:37.833
          Easy, easy.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.637
      We'll get her back.

01:00:46.276 --> 01:00:47.109
         I need a car.

01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:48.276
        What's going on?

01:00:48.479 --> 01:00:50.512
 Your boy Dayton's about to let
         that girl die.

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:53.482
  The house has a basement or
  cellar or something to it...

01:00:53.484 --> 01:00:55.517
   it's obviously well hidden
 and he wouldn't listen to me.

01:00:55.753 --> 01:00:57.953
   Ok, find Sgt. Adams, he's
      a friend of mine...

01:00:57.955 --> 01:01:00.055
   he's got a real knack for
       disobeying orders.

01:01:00.057 --> 01:01:01.423
      Get him to lead his
        team out there.

01:01:01.425 --> 01:01:03.425
    I'll get Wincer settled
  in and I'll meet you there.

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:10.599
           What's up?

01:01:10.601 --> 01:01:13.101
    Loomis thinks Rayborn's
   hiding under his house...

01:01:13.103 --> 01:01:14.836
   in a cellar or something.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:15.937
    So he's going out there.

01:01:15.939 --> 01:01:17.005
              And?

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.041
    Dayton wouldn't listen.

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:21.543
    Schmidty, I want you to
       watch these two...

01:01:23.247 --> 01:01:26.815
      Shit, I want you to
    watch out for this guy.
      You, you're with me.

01:01:51.175 --> 01:01:53.942
 (On radio): Suspect is a white
male, blue jeans, white t-shirt

01:01:53.944 --> 01:01:56.511
       last seen heading
     towards the basement.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.106
       Ah, hell with it.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:00.008
    Alright, we're searching
        the house again.

01:03:00.978 --> 01:03:03.078
        We searched it.

01:03:03.814 --> 01:03:06.214
    We're gonna do it again,
        inside and out.

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:09.351
  If we breach the house we're
  gonna give up our position.

01:03:09.353 --> 01:03:11.620
 Alright, did you not hear me?
 I said we're taking the house.

01:03:11.622 --> 01:03:12.821
        That's an order.

01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:13.955
     You don't give orders.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:15.957
I do today, now let's move out.

01:03:31.742 --> 01:03:33.441
         You got a gun?

01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:35.377
Beats the hell out of a machete.

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:05.340
          Clear left.

01:04:06.076 --> 01:04:07.309
          Clear right.

01:04:11.648 --> 01:04:12.747
       Bathroom's clear.

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:03.131
    What are we doing here?
     I gotta get something.

01:05:29.526 --> 01:05:30.859
         Do me a favor.

01:05:31.795 --> 01:05:33.161
        If I don't make
       it back tonight...

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:37.132
    come back here and burn
   this place to the ground.

01:06:23.013 --> 01:06:26.147
(On radio): This is team leader
      giving the all clear
      on the house, over.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:27.983
 Looks like the house is clear.

01:06:28.919 --> 01:06:30.452
      Surprise, surprise.

01:06:31.888 --> 01:06:33.455
      I gotta take a piss.

01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.768
       (Loud bang on car)

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:49.838
          Shit, shit.

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:53.742
        What the fuck?!

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:02.250
       (Gurgling noises)

01:07:11.628 --> 01:07:14.996
Alright, so that cop said theres
  a cellar in Rayborn's house.

01:07:15.632 --> 01:07:18.767
I'm gonna go distract the cops,
      you go around back.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:21.169
        Hey, be careful.

01:08:41.017 --> 01:08:43.551
       (Screams in pain)

01:09:15.452 --> 01:09:17.018
             Hands!

01:09:18.054 --> 01:09:20.688
     Let me see your hands!

01:09:22.192 --> 01:09:24.125
What the hell are you doing here

01:09:24.127 --> 01:09:27.662
     Looking for the cops,
     I can't find anybody.

01:09:31.201 --> 01:09:33.301
            Ah shit.

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.809
  Where the hell is everybody?

01:09:42.078 --> 01:09:45.647
  We don't know, we got blood
  all over this cruiser here.

01:09:47.484 --> 01:09:48.816
    There's another cruiser
       up on the hill...

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:50.285
       but nobody inside.

01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:51.618
        Try your radio?

01:09:51.621 --> 01:09:53.654
    I couldn't reach anyone.

01:09:56.159 --> 01:09:58.226
    Gotta search the house.

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:03.131
     Hold on just a second.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.172
              Hey.

01:10:12.242 --> 01:10:13.741
      I want you to go get
     in that cruiser and...

01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:15.710
   lay down in the back seat
 until I come get you, alright?

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.812
           Fuck that.

01:10:21.785 --> 01:10:25.019
      I wasn't asking you.

01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:26.921
            Alright?

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:28.923
           After you.

01:11:38.762 --> 01:11:40.028
      Is that gun loaded?

01:11:43.433 --> 01:11:45.033
           Shoot me.

01:11:46.936 --> 01:11:49.704
 I can't lift my arm to do it.

01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:02.583
   Use my gun, they'll check.

01:12:12.329 --> 01:12:14.896
    Don't go in that house.

01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:17.765
        Close your eyes.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.276
       I fucked this up.
       I fucked this up.

01:12:28.278 --> 01:12:30.511
         No you didn't.

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:32.513
          We got him.

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:34.515
         You did good.

01:12:35.952 --> 01:12:39.954
   I thought I was just gonna
       have to bleed out.

01:13:09.052 --> 01:13:10.885
           Door left.

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:19.894
         (Man screams)

01:14:45.482 --> 01:14:47.315
       It's me, it's me.
           - Steven?

01:14:47.317 --> 01:14:49.016
       Back up. Back up.
      - Okay, okay, okay.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:55.389
       Oh my god, Steven.
        - Are you okay?

01:14:55.391 --> 01:14:57.024
      I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:14:57.026 --> 01:14:58.059
          Where is he?

01:14:58.061 --> 01:14:59.393
  I don't know, I don't know,
         I don't know.

01:14:59.395 --> 01:15:00.461
       Alright, let's go.

01:15:00.463 --> 01:15:02.463
        No, no this way.
           This way.

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:20.982
        (Both coughing)

01:15:30.126 --> 01:15:32.059
             What?

01:15:32.061 --> 01:15:34.095
    Corey's still in there.

01:15:34.097 --> 01:15:36.964
     No, no Steven please.

01:15:36.966 --> 01:15:39.233
Listen to me, I know he got out.

01:15:39.235 --> 01:15:41.469
  Ok, he's not still in there.

01:15:42.238 --> 01:15:44.138
   He would come back for me.

01:15:44.641 --> 01:15:46.641
        Please don't go.

01:15:46.643 --> 01:15:49.510
    Please, I know he's not
     still in there, okay?

01:15:50.013 --> 01:15:55.683
 The villagers always kill the
monster with fire and pitchforks

01:15:56.619 --> 01:15:58.119
             What?

01:15:59.022 --> 01:16:02.623
  I'll come back for you, just
  stay in the truck you'll be
             safe.

01:16:02.625 --> 01:16:04.659
   Please stay here, please.

01:16:04.661 --> 01:16:06.661
    I'll come back for you.

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:10.064
              OK.

01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:08.289
         Corey: Steven!

01:17:42.558 --> 01:17:43.791
    (Corey screams in pain)

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:38.292
   Morgan: The only monsters
      you have to fear...

01:21:38.294 --> 01:21:40.427
       are the ones that
       walk on two legs.

01:22:19.135 --> 01:22:21.568
 I'm not afraid of you anymore.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.392
           (Gunshot)

01:23:18.127 --> 01:23:20.427
         My dad says...

01:23:20.763 --> 01:23:23.397
     a monster lives here.

01:23:26.435 --> 01:23:28.635
          Not anymore.

01:25:00.930 --> 01:25:03.330
      How you holding up?

01:25:03.332 --> 01:25:05.265
        I'll be alright.

01:25:05.835 --> 01:25:11.738
       I'll endure. You?
             Yeah.

01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:18.645
 My dad use to say that people
  look at their scars as proof
      that they were hurt.

01:25:21.517 --> 01:25:25.018
      It's also proof that
      there's healing too.

01:25:26.922 --> 01:25:28.689
           Smart dad.

01:25:28.958 --> 01:25:30.724
         Yeah, he was.

01:25:33.095 --> 01:25:34.761
           Mine too.

01:26:43.299 --> 01:26:46.867
               Â¶

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:07.354
   You know, I'm really glad
   you didn't sell the place.

01:27:07.356 --> 01:27:09.990
         Yeah, me too.

01:27:09.992 --> 01:27:13.026
  I'm especially glad that you
  didn't have to burn it down.

01:27:16.665 --> 01:27:18.865
   You still talk to Loomis.

01:27:19.034 --> 01:27:20.534
Not as much as before but, yeah.

01:27:20.536 --> 01:27:21.969
          Doing good.

01:27:21.971 --> 01:27:23.904
          Had a baby.
           - No shit.

01:27:23.906 --> 01:27:25.939
      Well, his wife did.

01:27:32.181 --> 01:27:33.780
 So how's the business running?

01:27:35.084 --> 01:27:37.684
 It's going, got two new boats.

01:27:38.387 --> 01:27:42.456
     Look at you, commodore
        Corey over here.

01:27:43.225 --> 01:27:45.459
     Yep, I'm big time now.

01:27:46.195 --> 01:27:49.863
    Seriously though, uncle
     Morgan would be proud.

01:27:51.634 --> 01:27:56.470
       Jealous, yeah, but
     definitely not proud.

01:27:59.742 --> 01:28:02.476
     Wanna go let baby girl
      open some presents?
    - Yeah, I guess we can.

01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:12.252
   You didn't really get her
     a can of mace did you?
     - Nah, not this time.

01:28:12.254 --> 01:28:15.389
 Seriously, Amanda freaked out.

01:28:15.391 --> 01:28:16.957
     Well, I mean not until
     I can get her a taser.

01:28:16.959 --> 01:28:18.992
     I mean if she grows up
   half as pretty as her mom.

01:28:20.296 --> 01:28:22.796
   Or worse, as pretty as me.

01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:28.769
     That won't be so bad.
 - What? I'd be crazy hot as a
             girl.

01:28:30.906 --> 01:28:33.440
  C'mon baby let's go inside.

01:28:35.044 --> 01:28:37.110
      Uncle Corey's ready
       to open presents.

01:28:38.881 --> 01:28:40.947
            Morgan.

01:28:46.422 --> 01:28:47.654
             C'mon.

01:28:49.091 --> 01:28:53.827
        You ready to go?
        - Why? Why? Why?
