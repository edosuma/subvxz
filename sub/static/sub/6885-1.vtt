00:44.128 --> 00:46.587
Greetings, my friend.

00:46.672 --> 00:50.049
You are interested in the unknown,

00:50.134 --> 00:53.678
the mysterious, the unexplainable.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.681
That is why you are here.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.933
And now, for the first time,

00:59.017 --> 01:02.645
we are bringing you the full story
of what happened.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.272
We are giving you all the evidence

01:05.357 --> 01:08.818
based only on the secret testimony
of the miserable souls

01:08.902 --> 01:12.405
who survived this terrifying ordeal.

01:12.489 --> 01:15.408
The incidents, places.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.995
My friend, we cannot keep this
a secret any longer.

01:19.288 --> 01:22.081
Can your heart stand the shocking facts

01:22.166 --> 01:24.125
of the true story

01:24.209 --> 01:27.336
of Edward D. Wood, Jr?

05:12.562 --> 05:16.148
It's 8:15.
We can't hold the curtain any longer.

05:16.233 --> 05:19.402
Cripes, what am I gonna tell the cast?
It's press night and there's no press!

05:20.779 --> 05:23.990
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- Nah, Tommy.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.033
That's just kiddie spook stories.

05:26.118 --> 05:30.121
Once you're dead, you stay dead.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.622
I don't know, Bill.

05:32.249 --> 05:36.127
Out on that battlefield today,
I saw this woman dressed in white

05:36.211 --> 05:38.713
floating above the dunes.

05:38.922 --> 05:43.300
Maybe it was just fatigue
or maybe it's the indignities of war.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.469
Or maybe it's somethin' else.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.600
Hey, I think I see somethin'.

05:57.774 --> 06:01.610
I offer you mortals the bird of peace

06:01.820 --> 06:04.321
so that you may change your ways

06:04.448 --> 06:06.782
and end this destruction.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.833
What a show! Everyone was terrific.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.878
Paul, your second act monologue
actually gave me the chills.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.212
Oh, thanks, Eddie.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.006
I got the early edition,
hot off the presses!

06:22.090 --> 06:24.008
This is the big moment.

06:34.311 --> 06:37.396
Oh, what does that old queen know?

06:37.481 --> 06:39.482
She didn't even show.

06:41.985 --> 06:44.612
Sent her copy boy to do the dirty work.

06:44.696 --> 06:50.367
- Screw you, Miss Crowley.
- Do I really have a face like a horse?

06:50.452 --> 06:52.578
What does "ostentatious" mean?

06:52.662 --> 06:55.247
Hey, it's not that bad.
You can't concentrate on the negative.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.458
Look, he's got some nice things
to say here.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.377
"The soldiers' costumes are very realistic."
That's positive!

07:00.462 --> 07:03.798
- Rave of the century.
- Well, I've seen a lot worse reviews.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.967
I've seen reviews where they didn't
even mention the costumes.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.970
Like that last Francis the Mule picture.
It got terrible notices.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.014
- Huge hit!
- Lines around the block.

07:12.099 --> 07:15.893
That's right. Don't take it too seriously.
We're all doing great work.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.229
- Do you really think so?
- Absolutely.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.233
Honey, what if I'm wrong?

07:22.317 --> 07:26.529
- What if I just don't got it?
- Ed, it was only one review.

07:26.613 --> 07:30.241
Orson Welles was only 26
when he made <i>Citizen Kane.</i>

07:30.534 --> 07:32.284
I'm already 30.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.996
Ed, you're still young.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.958
This is the time in your life
when you're supposed to be struggling.

07:39.042 --> 07:43.212
I know. But I'm scared it's not going
to get any better than this.

07:46.341 --> 07:49.969
Oh, I hate having to wake up this early.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.769
Gosh, where's my pink sweater?

08:00.105 --> 08:02.898
I can never seem to find
my clothes anymore.

08:08.864 --> 08:12.950
Hey, big shot! Get off your ass
and get this over to the executive building.

08:13.034 --> 08:17.413
- Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
- Hey, Charlie, come here.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.708
What did I tell ya about watering these plants, eh?
I want some water on 'em!

08:20.792 --> 08:23.419
Don't sprinkle the damn things!
Soak 'em!

08:33.096 --> 08:35.097
Hi.

08:35.182 --> 08:38.058
All right, people, settle.
And action!

08:47.819 --> 08:50.487
Wow! Look at these camels!

08:50.572 --> 08:52.489
These are real camels!

08:54.034 --> 08:57.244
- Gosh, where'd they get real camels?
- Hey, you!

08:57.329 --> 08:59.830
Move it outta here, huh?

09:04.461 --> 09:09.256
Hey, Eddie! Come in here.
I got some great new stuff to show you.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.603
This is fantastic.
What are you gonna do with it?

09:22.687 --> 09:25.314
Probably file it away
and never see it again.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.690
Ah, it's such a waste.

09:30.528 --> 09:31.612
Why, if I had half the chance,

09:31.696 --> 09:33.822
I could make an entire movie
using this stock footage.

09:36.952 --> 09:40.454
The story opens on these
mysterious explosions.

09:40.538 --> 09:43.582
Nobody knows what's causing them,
but it's upsetting all the buffalo.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.627
So the military are called in
to solve the mystery.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.504
You forgot the octopus.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.090
No, no. I'm saving that
for my big underwater climax.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.845
Hello.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.890
They say he was a girl
trapped in a man's body.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.976
I bet it hurt when
they cut his thing off.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.646
What are you ladies gabbin' about?

10:05.855 --> 10:07.439
You know that Christine Jorgensen freak?

10:07.524 --> 10:10.109
- It's...
- He... She... in <i>Variety.</i>

10:10.193 --> 10:12.653
Some producer's makin' a biopic.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.407
Really? I didn't read that story.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.495
Yes, I've got Mr. Edward Wood
on the line.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.539
Could you please hold?

10:26.001 --> 10:29.211
Mr. Weiss? Ed Wood here.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.921
Listen, I heard about your new project

10:31.006 --> 10:33.507
and I was curious
if you'd signed a director yet.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.551
Oh, you haven't!

10:35.635 --> 10:38.137
Well, if we could get together,
I could explain to you

10:38.221 --> 10:42.016
why I'm more qualified to direct this
than anyone else in town.

10:43.435 --> 10:47.021
Well, I'd rather not go into that
over the phone.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.273
All right. Great!

10:49.357 --> 10:52.234
I'll see you then. Bye!

10:53.111 --> 10:54.361
Eddie, I don't understand.

10:54.446 --> 10:57.948
Why are you the most qualified director
for the Christine Jorgensen story?

10:58.074 --> 11:00.576
Oh, it's just hogwash, hon.
I had to get into the door somehow.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.640
No, I love you like a brother.

11:23.725 --> 11:27.269
No, no, no. No, no, no.
That's a falsehood!

11:28.938 --> 11:30.856
Come in!

11:30.940 --> 11:34.068
Look, when I said
you could have the western territories,

11:34.152 --> 11:36.320
I didn't mean all 11 states!

11:36.613 --> 11:40.240
I meant California, Oregon,
and what's that one on top?

11:40.325 --> 11:42.284
Washington, yeah, yeah!

11:42.369 --> 11:44.536
Oh, really?

11:44.621 --> 11:46.622
Well, screw you!

11:48.041 --> 11:49.500
Hi. Can I help you?

11:49.584 --> 11:50.584
Yes. I'm Ed Wood.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.628
I'm here about directing
the Christine Jorgensen picture.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.422
Well, a couple of things have changed.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.883
It ain't gonna be
the Christine Jorgensen story no more.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.636
Goddamn <i>Variety</i> had to print the story
before I got the rights.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.847
- Now that bitch is asking for the sky.
- Ah, you're not gonna make the movie.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.350
No, of course I'm gonna make the picture.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.228
I already presold Alabama and Oklahoma.

12:09.312 --> 12:12.481
Those repressed Okies,
they go for that twisted, perverted stuff.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.484
We'll just do it without the she-male.
We'll fictionalize it.

12:15.568 --> 12:19.863
- Is there a script?
- Fuck no. But, there's a poster.

12:22.534 --> 12:25.327
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.913
Well, Mr. Weiss, look no further.
I'm your man.

12:27.997 --> 12:31.917
I work fast and I'm a deal.
I write and direct. And I'm good.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.293
I just did a play in Hollywood

12:33.378 --> 12:35.712
and Victor Crowley himself
praised its realism.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.674
There's about 500 guys in this town
that can say the same thing.

12:38.758 --> 12:42.344
On the phone you said you had
some special qualifications?

12:47.684 --> 12:49.643
Mr. Weiss

12:50.728 --> 12:52.980
I have never told anyone

12:53.064 --> 12:55.232
what I'm about to tell you.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.693
But I really want this job.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.323
I like to dress in women's clothing.

13:05.535 --> 13:06.660
You're a fruit?

13:06.744 --> 13:08.537
No, not at all. I love women.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.581
Wearing their clothes
makes me feel closer to them.

13:11.124 --> 13:15.002
- You're not a fruit.
- No, I'm all man. I even fought in WWII.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.254
Of course, I was wearing
women's undergarments under my uniform.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.090
Ya got to be kidding me.

13:20.175 --> 13:23.385
Confidentially, I even paratrooped
wearing a brassiere and panties.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.805
I tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed,
but I was terrified of getting wounded

13:26.890 --> 13:28.432
and having the medics discover my secret.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.810
So you think this qualifies you
to make my movie?

13:31.895 --> 13:33.645
Yes!

13:34.355 --> 13:36.732
I know what it's like to live with a secret

13:36.816 --> 13:38.400
and worry about what people
are gonna think of ya.

13:40.236 --> 13:43.405
My girlfriend still doesn't know
why her sweaters are always stretched out.

13:45.033 --> 13:48.535
Ed, you seem like a nice kid.
Look around you.

13:48.620 --> 13:52.331
I don't hire directors with burning desires
to tell their stories.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.416
I make movies like <i>Chained Girls.</i>

13:54.501 --> 13:55.792
I need someone with experience

13:55.877 --> 13:58.128
who can shoot a film in four days
and make me a profit.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.756
I'm sorry. That's all that matters.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.387
Can I get you anything else, kid?

14:56.020 --> 14:59.398
Too constrictive!
I can't even fold my arms.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.775
Gee, Mr. Lugosi,
I've never had any complaints.

15:01.985 --> 15:05.237
This is the most uncomfortable coffin
I've ever been in.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.907
Your selection is quite shoddy.
You're wasting my time!

15:10.827 --> 15:11.868
Mr. Lugosi?

15:11.953 --> 15:13.954
I told you I don't want
any of your goddamn coffins!

15:14.038 --> 15:16.582
No, no! I don't work here.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.751
- Then who are you? What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

15:19.836 --> 15:23.213
I'm just a really big, big fan.
I've seen all your movies.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.095
Mr. Lugosi, why are you buying a coffin?

15:30.179 --> 15:31.513
I'm planning on dying soon.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.265
- No!
- Yes!

15:33.349 --> 15:35.434
I'm embarking on another bus
and truck tour of <i>Dracula.</i>

15:35.518 --> 15:38.437
Twelve cities in 10 days,
if that's conceivable.

15:38.521 --> 15:42.024
Do you know that I saw you perform <i>Dracula</i>
in Poughkeepsie in 1938?

15:42.108 --> 15:43.775
That was a terrible production.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.445
- Renfield was a drunk!
- I thought it was great.

15:46.529 --> 15:50.115
You know, you're much scarier in real life
than you are in the movie.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.117
Thank you.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.661
I even waited outside to get your autograph,
but you never came out.

15:54.746 --> 15:57.831
Well, I apologize. When I play Dracula,
I put myself into a trance.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.459
It takes me much time to reemerge.

16:01.794 --> 16:05.130
Oh, there's my bus.
Shit, where is my transfer?

16:05.214 --> 16:08.133
- Say, don't you have a car?
- I refuse to drive in this country.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.218
Too many madmen.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.472
I've got a car.

16:18.895 --> 16:22.272
Boy, Mr. Lugosi,
you must lead such an exciting life.

16:22.357 --> 16:26.735
- When is your next picture coming out?
- I have no next picture.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.153
You gotta be jokin'.

16:28.237 --> 16:31.031
A great star like you,
you must have dozens of 'em lined up.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.492
Back in the old days, yes.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.495
But now, no one gives two fucks for Bela.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.956
- But you're a big star.
- No more.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.125
I haven't worked in four years.

16:43.628 --> 16:47.798
This business, this town,
it chews you up, then spits you out.

16:47.882 --> 16:52.260
I'm just an ex-bogeyman.
Make a right.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.944
They don't want
the classic horror films anymore.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.531
Today, it's all giant bugs.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.909
Giant spiders, giant grasshoppers.

17:15.992 --> 17:17.786
Who would believe such nonsense?

17:18.287 --> 17:22.749
The old ones were much spookier,
they had castles and full moons.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.626
They were mythic.

17:24.836 --> 17:27.212
- They had a poetry to them.
- Yes.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.215
And you know what else? The women...

17:30.299 --> 17:34.386
The women prefer the traditional monsters.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.388
The women. Huh.

17:36.472 --> 17:40.642
The pure horror,
it both repels and attracts them.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.353
Because in their collective unconsciousness,

17:43.646 --> 17:45.897
they have the agony of childbirth.

17:45.982 --> 17:49.651
The blood... The blood is horror.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.155
You know, I never thought of that.

17:55.283 --> 17:57.200
Take my word for it.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.828
If you want to make out
with a young lady

17:59.912 --> 18:01.798
you take her to see <i>Dracula.</i>

18:10.506 --> 18:12.424
Eh, what a mess.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.427
My wife of 20 years left me last month.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.004
I'm not much of a housekeeper.

18:17.889 --> 18:20.932
All right, I'm coming.
I'll feed you, my darlings.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.058
I'd better get going.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.812
But perhaps we could get together
again some time, Mr. Lugosi.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.815
Certainly.

18:28.900 --> 18:32.486
But now, the children of the night
are calling me.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.023
Uh...

18:36.783 --> 18:38.700
- Good day.
- Good day.

18:42.038 --> 18:45.081
Sweetie, you won't believe it.
I've got incredible news.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.793
- You got the job!
- No, I didn't get the job.

18:47.877 --> 18:51.505
- But something better happened.
- Better than not getting the job.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.257
Yes! I met a movie star.

18:54.550 --> 18:58.136
- Somebody really big.
- Who? Robert Taylor?

18:58.221 --> 19:01.348
No. A horror movie star.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.892
- Boris Karloff?
- Close.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.018
The other one.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.481
You met Basil Rathbone!

19:09.565 --> 19:12.818
Oh, to heck with you.
I met Bela Lugosi.

19:12.902 --> 19:17.405
- Why, I thought he was dead.
- No, he's very much alive.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.824
Well,

19:18.908 --> 19:20.033
sort of.

19:21.077 --> 19:25.330
He's old and frail, but he's still Bela Lugosi
and he's really nice.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.791
I can't even remember the last time
I saw him in a picture.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.125
It's a shame.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.586
He's such a great actor
and no one uses him anymore.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.506
- So, did you get his autograph?
- No, it wasn't like that at all.

19:34.590 --> 19:38.927
It was just the two of us and we were talking.
He treated me like a friend.

19:39.053 --> 19:41.555
- Yeah, well, he's a bum.
- No, he's not.

19:41.639 --> 19:44.099
Do you have any idea how much money
he made for this studio?

19:44.183 --> 19:46.142
<i>Dracula, The Black Cat, The Raven.</i>

19:46.227 --> 19:48.353
Yeah? Well, now he's a junkie.
He don't deserve to work.

19:48.437 --> 19:52.440
- That is not true!
- He's so great, you hire him.

19:53.708 --> 19:55.652
Yeah, well, I would if I could.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.655
Trick or treat!

19:58.739 --> 20:00.949
The house looks like
they have lots of kids.

20:25.641 --> 20:29.019
<i>Oh, those eyes.
He gives me the willies.</i>

20:29.103 --> 20:32.063
Uh, I hate it when she interrupts the picture.

20:32.148 --> 20:35.066
She doesn't show 'em
the proper respect.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.110
I think she's a honey.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.572
Look at those jugs.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.199
<i>But he stood me up at the restaurant.</i>

20:43.284 --> 20:45.452
<i>I guess I shouldn't have picked
a steak house.</i>

20:47.496 --> 20:50.457
<i>And then I went out with the Wolf Man.
What an evening. </i>

20:50.541 --> 20:52.626
<i>I didn't know whether
to kiss him good night...</i>

20:52.710 --> 20:57.422
Vampira, you will come under my spell.

20:59.842 --> 21:03.345
You will be my slave of love.

21:03.429 --> 21:06.306
My gosh, Bela! How do you do that?

21:06.390 --> 21:09.434
You must be double-jointed.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.853
And you must be Hungarian.

21:13.856 --> 21:17.067
Vampira, look at me.

21:17.151 --> 21:20.111
Look into my eyes.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.864
<i>You're watching our Halloween movie,
White Zombie</i>

21:23.115 --> 21:26.284
<i>starring Bela Lugosi,
John Harron, Madge Bellamy,</i>

21:26.369 --> 21:28.995
<i>and a bunch of other people
I've never heard of.</i>

21:33.668 --> 21:35.710
I'm very tired.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.089
I need to take my medicine.

21:39.882 --> 21:42.217
- Do you want me to get it for you?
- No.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.719
Thank you, Eddie.
I'll be all right.

22:14.791 --> 22:16.584
Oh, shit.

22:32.075 --> 22:33.977
I feel much better!

22:35.061 --> 22:37.272
Children! I love children!

22:43.112 --> 22:45.448
Trick or treat!

22:47.700 --> 22:50.702
Aren't you scared, little boy?

22:50.786 --> 22:54.372
I'm going to drink your blood.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.458
You're not a real vampire.

22:56.959 --> 22:59.711
Those teeth don't frighten me.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.423
How about these?

23:05.134 --> 23:08.470
Hey, how'd you do that?

23:08.554 --> 23:12.307
Dentures. Lost my pearlies in the war.

23:12.808 --> 23:17.020
So, what was the important news
you couldn't tell me on the phone, again?

23:17.146 --> 23:18.938
I started thinking about
what you were saying

23:19.023 --> 23:20.899
about how your movies
need to make a profit.

23:20.983 --> 23:24.903
What is the one thing, if you put it
in a movie, it'll be successful?

23:24.987 --> 23:27.530
- Tits.
- No, better than that. A star.

23:27.782 --> 23:30.992
Kid, you must have me confused
with David Selznick.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.411
I don't make major motion pictures,
I make crap.

23:33.496 --> 23:37.248
Yes! But if you take that crap and put
a star in it, then you've got something.

23:37.333 --> 23:40.251
- Yeah. Crap with a star.
- No, something better!

23:40.336 --> 23:42.128
Something impressive.

23:42.379 --> 23:45.173
Maybe the biggest money-maker
you've ever had.

23:46.257 --> 23:47.550
Fine, all right.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.969
You may be right,
but it doesn't frickin' matter.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.472
I can't afford a star,
so what are we even talkin' about?

23:52.556 --> 23:55.850
All right. What if I told you
you could have a star for $1,000?

23:56.310 --> 23:58.269
Who?

24:03.359 --> 24:05.985
- Lugosi?
- Yes! Lugosi!

24:06.070 --> 24:07.445
Isn't he dead?

24:07.530 --> 24:09.614
No, he's not dead.
He lives in Baldwin Hills.

24:09.698 --> 24:12.283
I met him recently
and he really wants to be in our movie.

24:12.368 --> 24:15.495
Why would Lugosi want
to do a sex change flick?

24:15.746 --> 24:18.081
Because he's my friend!

24:20.459 --> 24:22.585
All right, fine!
You can direct it.

24:22.670 --> 24:26.297
I want a script in three days.
We start shooting a week from Monday.

24:26.382 --> 24:31.761
Mr. Weiss, thank you so much.
You won't regret it. I won't let you down.

24:35.224 --> 24:38.726
But, Bunny, you're perfect for this job.
You know these people.

24:38.811 --> 24:42.105
I need all the transsexuals
and transvestites I can get.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.691
No, I don't care if they're not actors.
I want realism!

24:44.942 --> 24:46.527
I want this film to tell the truth.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.529
Coming!

24:49.613 --> 24:53.324
I've waited all my life for this shot,
and I'm not gonna blow it.

24:53.409 --> 24:56.995
- Eddie, you got a new movie for me, eh?
- Yes!

24:57.079 --> 25:00.665
It's gonna be a great picture
and you'll love your character. Have a seat.

25:02.418 --> 25:06.588
Listen, Bunny? Bela's here.
I gotta go.

25:06.839 --> 25:10.133
Listen, hit the bars, work some parties,
and get me transvestites!

25:10.217 --> 25:13.595
I need transvestites!
All right. Bye.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.766
Eddie, what kind of a movie is this?

25:20.102 --> 25:22.896
Well, it's about how people
have two personalities:

25:22.980 --> 25:26.357
The side they show to the world,
and then the secret person they hide inside.

25:26.609 --> 25:28.443
Like Jekyll and Hyde.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.987
I've always wanted
to play Jekyll and Hyde.

25:31.071 --> 25:33.107
I'm looking forward to this production.

25:33.991 --> 25:36.159
Well, your part's a little different.

25:36.243 --> 25:37.827
You're like the god that looks over

25:37.912 --> 25:39.746
all the characters
and oversees everything.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.373
I don't understand.

25:42.458 --> 25:45.001
You control everyone's fate.
You're like the puppet master.

25:47.004 --> 25:51.716
- Ah, so I pull the strings!
- Yes, you pull the strings.

25:51.800 --> 25:55.428
"Pull the strings." I like that!

26:00.517 --> 26:02.393
Honey!

26:02.478 --> 26:04.854
I got a little surprise for you.

26:04.939 --> 26:06.981
Wipe off your hands.

26:08.776 --> 26:11.945
- I finished my script.
- Oh!

26:12.029 --> 26:14.572
Ed, I'm so proud of you!

26:16.867 --> 26:19.077
I'll read it as soon as I get home.

26:19.161 --> 26:21.955
Well, I'd really like
to know what you think.

26:22.039 --> 26:25.291
Why don't you go in the bedroom
and take a look? I'll wait.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.294
Go ahead.

26:28.379 --> 26:30.338
Take your time.

27:16.885 --> 27:19.387
So that's where my sweater's been.

27:20.931 --> 27:23.558
How long have you been doing this?

27:25.019 --> 27:27.061
Since I was a kid.

27:27.146 --> 27:31.065
My mom wanted a girl,
so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.067
Just became a habit.

27:34.361 --> 27:36.571
Jesus Christ!
And you never told me?

27:36.655 --> 27:38.698
Well, this is my way of telling you.

27:39.158 --> 27:42.618
What, by putting it in a fucking script
for everyone to see?

27:42.703 --> 27:45.079
What kind of sick mind
operates like that?

27:45.289 --> 27:47.915
And what about this,
this so-called Barbara character

27:48.000 --> 27:49.959
that's obviously me?

27:50.044 --> 27:52.045
I mean, this is our life.
It's so embarrassing!

27:52.129 --> 27:54.172
Of course it is.
That's why you should play the part.

27:54.256 --> 27:55.715
Oh, you got nerve, buddy.

27:55.799 --> 27:59.177
- It's a darn good role.
- That's not the issue!

27:59.261 --> 28:03.056
God, how can you act so casual
when you're dressed like that?

28:04.725 --> 28:06.684
It makes me feel comfortable.

28:07.144 --> 28:10.021
Oh, just like in the script.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.023
Exactly.

28:15.611 --> 28:18.321
So, what do you say?

28:18.405 --> 28:20.323
Do we break up?

28:22.493 --> 28:25.661
Or do you want to make
the movie with me?

28:28.624 --> 28:31.959
They make you tall, and you're flashy.
They want that.

28:32.211 --> 28:35.129
Okay. But they want professionalism,
so nix on the Nelly

28:35.339 --> 28:37.757
without losing naiveté, okay?

28:37.841 --> 28:38.883
Now, the good news is

28:38.967 --> 28:41.677
you're probably going to get hired
because you look like Peggy Lee.

28:41.762 --> 28:45.098
But I don't want anybody else
to resent that, okay? Please?

28:45.182 --> 28:47.183
'Cause there's enough for everybody,
exotics, too.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.519
All right, because if you're not going to smile,
please don't bother.

28:49.603 --> 28:50.603
You'll embarrass me.

28:50.687 --> 28:51.938
This is George Weiss.

28:52.022 --> 28:54.440
He's done some very important things,
he's a nice person to know.

28:54.525 --> 28:56.901
I thought you were gonna make
a sex change film!

28:56.985 --> 28:59.862
- It's still a sex change film.
- Yeah! Five pages before it ends!

28:59.947 --> 29:02.532
The rest is about some schmuck
who likes angora sweaters!

29:02.616 --> 29:04.200
I don't think he's a schmuck.

29:04.284 --> 29:07.912
What about this title? My poster says,
<i>I Changed My Sex.</i>

29:07.996 --> 29:09.122
So change the poster.

29:09.206 --> 29:12.083
Trust me, you'll be better off.
This story's gonna grab people.

29:12.167 --> 29:15.628
It's about this guy, he's crazy about this girl,
but he likes to wear dresses.

29:15.712 --> 29:19.424
Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?
He's torn. This is drama!

29:19.508 --> 29:22.301
Fine! Shoot whatever baloney you want.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.262
Just make sure it's seven reels long.

29:26.974 --> 29:28.891
Testing.

29:28.976 --> 29:31.936
Excuse me.
Can I get everyone's attention, please?

29:32.020 --> 29:33.938
Could you gather around?

29:37.025 --> 29:39.735
I've got something to say.

29:39.987 --> 29:43.573
Everybody, we're about to embark on
quite a journey: four days of hard work.

29:43.657 --> 29:47.452
But when it's over, we'll have a picture
that'll entertain, enlighten

29:47.536 --> 29:50.204
and maybe even move
millions of people.

29:50.456 --> 29:53.708
Excuse me, Eddie. I don't mean to interrupt.
I'm worried about the light.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.335
Good thinking. All right,
we'll talk about days three and four later.

29:56.420 --> 30:00.756
Let's get that first shot off.
Scene 17, Glenda looking in the window.

30:02.041 --> 30:04.844
And action!

30:20.611 --> 30:22.403
And cut!

30:22.779 --> 30:24.572
Print that! Let's move on!

30:24.656 --> 30:26.616
Don't you want a second take
for protection?

30:26.700 --> 30:28.784
What's to protect?
It was perfect! Come on!

30:30.120 --> 30:31.913
Hey! Cops!

30:34.291 --> 30:36.542
We don't have a permit. Run!

30:38.629 --> 30:40.463
Come on. Let's go.

30:45.427 --> 30:48.137
What's going on
with these revised pages?

30:48.222 --> 30:49.514
Mr. Lugosi's here.

30:49.598 --> 30:52.183
Oh, my God!
Mr. Lugosi's here!

30:52.267 --> 30:54.727
Everyone! Everyone!

30:54.811 --> 30:57.772
Everyone, come on.
Come in here.

31:00.609 --> 31:02.527
Listen.

31:02.611 --> 31:05.530
When he walks onto the stage,
treat him normal.

31:05.614 --> 31:09.825
I know Bela Lugosi's a world-famous star
and you're all very excited

31:09.910 --> 31:12.370
but look, we are professionals.

31:12.454 --> 31:16.207
So, just treat him with respect.
Everything will be all right.

31:22.798 --> 31:24.715
Bela!

31:29.513 --> 31:32.390
Great to see ya!
8:00 on the dot. Right on time.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.976
- I'm always on time.
- Of course you are.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.228
We've got a big day
planned for you.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.312
But first we're gonna start out

31:38.397 --> 31:40.231
kinda easy with you
in that armchair over there.

31:40.315 --> 31:41.774
Then once you're up to speed and cookin',

31:41.858 --> 31:43.401
we'll reset and bring in the lab equipment.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.444
- Eddie?
- Huh?

31:49.992 --> 31:52.994
- What about my money?
- Huh? Oh.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.845
What are you people doing?
Get back to work!

32:28.363 --> 32:30.615
All right, people.
Let's get ready.

32:41.710 --> 32:44.670
Mr. Lugosi, I know you're very busy

32:44.755 --> 32:47.131
but, can I have your autograph?

32:48.342 --> 32:50.301
Certainly.

32:54.222 --> 32:57.892
You know which movie of yours I love, Mr. Lugosi?
<i>The Invisible Ray.</i>

32:58.143 --> 32:59.935
You were great as Karloff's sidekick.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.398
Karloff?

33:06.068 --> 33:08.653
Sidekick?

33:08.737 --> 33:10.738
Fuck you!

33:10.822 --> 33:14.492
Karloff does not deserve
to smell my shit!

33:14.576 --> 33:17.536
That limey cocksucker
can rot in hell for all I care!

33:17.621 --> 33:19.121
What happened?

33:19.206 --> 33:21.457
How dare that asshole bring up Karloff?

33:21.541 --> 33:23.918
You think it takes talent
to play Frankenstein?

33:24.169 --> 33:26.505
It's all make-up and grunting.

33:27.589 --> 33:30.132
I agree. Bela, I agree 100%.

33:30.217 --> 33:33.219
Now, Dracula, that's a role
that requires talent.

33:33.303 --> 33:36.389
Of course!
Dracula requires presence.

33:36.473 --> 33:39.058
It's all in the eyes and the voice

33:39.142 --> 33:41.268
- and the hand.
- That's right. That's right.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.647
You seem a little agitated.
You wanna go outside and get some air?

33:44.731 --> 33:47.775
Bullshit! I'm ready now.
Roll the camera!

33:49.861 --> 33:51.779
We're rolling.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.740
- Sound. Speed.
- Scene 97, take one. Mark.

33:56.225 --> 33:57.284
Action.

34:02.332 --> 34:04.300
Beware.

34:05.502 --> 34:07.470
Beware.

34:08.755 --> 34:12.882
Beware of the big, green dragon

34:12.967 --> 34:15.511
that sits on your doorstep.

34:17.013 --> 34:19.931
He eats little boys,

34:20.016 --> 34:22.101
puppy dog tails,

34:22.185 --> 34:26.147
and big, fat snails.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.150
Beware.

34:29.234 --> 34:31.193
Take care.

34:33.822 --> 34:35.906
Beware.

34:37.451 --> 34:39.702
Wait!

34:42.164 --> 34:46.542
Pull the string! Pull the string!

34:49.087 --> 34:50.504
Cut.

34:52.123 --> 34:53.340
Perfect.

34:54.009 --> 34:57.178
But Georgie, I'm proud.
I wrote, directed and starred in it

34:57.262 --> 34:59.764
just like Orson Welles did
in <i>Citizen Kane.</i>

34:59.848 --> 35:03.017
Yeah, well, Orson Welles didn't wear
angora sweaters, did he?

35:11.026 --> 35:13.694
How can you just walk around like that
in front of all these people?

35:15.322 --> 35:18.991
Well, hon, nobody's bothered but you.
Look around.

35:19.075 --> 35:20.826
Ed, this isn't the real world!

35:20.911 --> 35:22.703
You've surrounded yourself
with a bunch of weirdoes.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.414
Oh, say it a little louder.
I don't think Bela heard you.

35:34.173 --> 35:35.090
Dolores.

35:37.219 --> 35:38.511
I need your help.

35:40.722 --> 35:44.433
My mind's in a muddle,
like in a thick fog.

35:47.395 --> 35:50.147
I thought I could stop
wearing these things.

35:50.232 --> 35:52.566
I tried. Honestly, I tried.

36:08.625 --> 36:10.709
Glen.

36:10.794 --> 36:13.921
I don't fully understand

36:14.130 --> 36:16.507
but maybe together
we can work this out.

36:41.992 --> 36:45.077
Music swells. Cut and print!

36:45.761 --> 36:47.121
It's a wrap.

36:51.084 --> 36:53.502
How do you do?
I'm here to see Mr. Feldman.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.629
What's your name?

36:55.839 --> 36:57.339
Edward D. Wood, Jr.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.769
He's in the executive building.

37:10.854 --> 37:13.230
- You can park in the reserved section.
- Thanks very much.

37:13.315 --> 37:16.233
- Please, sit down.
- Thanks.

37:18.403 --> 37:22.406
So, what are you bringing me?
Looks like you got some film cans.

37:22.490 --> 37:26.118
Well, some people bring their resumes.
I've brought my own movie.

37:26.202 --> 37:28.579
Really. Well, good for you.

37:28.663 --> 37:32.708
I just shot this baby for Screen Classics.
It opens next week.

37:32.792 --> 37:36.086
Screen Classics?
No, I don't know them.

37:36.171 --> 37:38.130
There's something you should know.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.758
Nobody in town has seen this picture,

37:40.842 --> 37:43.052
so I'm giving you
first crack at my talents.

37:43.136 --> 37:45.179
Thank you.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.307
And I'm anxious to see it.

37:48.391 --> 37:50.309
So, what's up next for you?

37:50.393 --> 37:52.353
I don't believe in thinking small,

37:52.437 --> 37:54.563
so I've got a whole slate of pictures for you.

37:54.648 --> 37:56.649
You ready? Okay.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.027
<i>The Vampire's Tomb.</i>

38:02.364 --> 38:04.406
<i>The Ghoul Goes West.</i>

38:06.952 --> 38:08.911
And

38:11.039 --> 38:13.082
<i>Doctor Acula.</i>

38:15.293 --> 38:18.837
<i>Doctor Acula?</i> I don't get it.

38:21.341 --> 38:22.925
<i>Doctor</i>

38:23.009 --> 38:25.094
<i>Racula.</i>

38:25.595 --> 38:27.221
Oh, I get it.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.223
I don't like it.

38:29.432 --> 38:32.351
But it'll star Bela Lugosi.

38:32.735 --> 38:37.356
Bela Lugosi? Lugosi's all washed-up.
What else you got?

38:40.902 --> 38:44.321
Well, I do have another project.

38:44.406 --> 38:46.782
I wasn't going to tell you about it.

38:46.866 --> 38:49.201
Lugosi's in it, but it's a small part.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.662
The lead is an ingénue.

38:51.746 --> 38:55.124
A sterling, young actress,
Dolores Fuller.

38:56.584 --> 38:59.003
The title of the film:

38:59.087 --> 39:01.880
<i>Bride Of The Atom!</i>

39:04.175 --> 39:06.635
Atomic age stuff, huh?

39:09.180 --> 39:11.640
I like it. I like it.

39:11.725 --> 39:14.518
I tell you what, Mr. Ward.
Why don't you leave your film cans with me.

39:14.602 --> 39:17.062
And my associates and I
will take a look at your little opus

39:17.147 --> 39:19.773
and maybe we can do
some business together.

39:19.858 --> 39:24.445
<i>Take care. Beware.</i>

39:26.114 --> 39:29.783
<i>Pull the string! Pull the string!</i>

39:29.868 --> 39:31.785
What the hell is this?

39:31.870 --> 39:34.538
- Is this an actual movie?
- It can't be!

39:34.622 --> 39:39.001
<i>Give this man satin undies,
a dress, sweater and skirt,</i>

39:39.085 --> 39:41.086
<i>or even the lounging outfit he has on</i>

39:41.171 --> 39:42.504
<i>and he's the happiest human being
in the world.</i>

39:42.589 --> 39:44.089
Wait a minute.

39:44.174 --> 39:47.259
Wait a minute.
That guy in the dress.

39:47.343 --> 39:49.636
That's the guy I met today.

39:50.972 --> 39:52.723
Oh, this has got to be a put-on.

39:52.807 --> 39:55.476
<i>These things are his comfort.</i>

39:55.560 --> 39:58.896
This is probably another one
of Billy Wellman's practical jokes.

39:58.980 --> 40:00.355
<i>He just entered the street dressed</i>

40:00.440 --> 40:02.900
<i>in the clothes he so much desires to wear.</i>

40:02.984 --> 40:05.736
<i>But, only if he really appears female:</i>

40:05.820 --> 40:07.738
<i>Long hair, make-up, clothing,
the actual contours of a girl.</i>

40:07.822 --> 40:08.906
Oh, God!

40:08.990 --> 40:12.076
<i>Most transvestites do not want
to change their life, their bodies.</i>

40:12.160 --> 40:14.495
This is funny. This is funny.

40:26.007 --> 40:28.008
Thank you.

40:36.893 --> 40:38.769
Georgie, I thought <i>Glen Or Glenda?</i>

40:38.853 --> 40:40.395
was opening this week.
Where's the ads?

40:40.480 --> 40:41.605
Where's the ads?

40:41.689 --> 40:43.941
The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, Missouri,
you schmuck!

40:44.192 --> 40:45.943
It ain't gonna play in L.A.!

40:46.027 --> 40:49.029
- Why not?
- Nobody wants to see this piece of shit!

40:49.114 --> 40:50.864
Hey, you can't talk that way
about my movie!

40:50.949 --> 40:53.826
Your movie?
I wish it was your movie!

40:53.910 --> 40:57.746
I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made
into making this stink bomb!

40:57.831 --> 41:00.499
And if I ever see ya again,
I'll kill ya!

41:03.044 --> 41:05.129
Hello?

41:05.213 --> 41:06.672
Georgie?

41:17.016 --> 41:20.227
- Guess where I'm going next week?
- I don't know. Where?

41:20.311 --> 41:22.563
Mexico.

41:22.772 --> 41:26.275
- Guess what I'm doing when I get there.
- I don't know. Lie on a beach.

41:26.359 --> 41:30.445
Wrong. I'm getting my first series
of hormone injections.

41:30.530 --> 41:32.656
When those girls kick in

41:32.740 --> 41:36.785
they're gonna take out my organs
and make me a woman.

41:36.870 --> 41:38.453
Are you serious?

41:38.538 --> 41:41.665
It's something I've wanted to do
for a long time.

41:41.749 --> 41:45.836
But it wasn't until I saw your movie
that I realized I have to take action!

41:45.920 --> 41:49.173
- Goodbye, penis!
- Would you please keep it down.

41:49.257 --> 41:52.634
The "Super Swedish Angel,"
Tor Johnson!

42:04.480 --> 42:07.107
My gosh, look at that guy.
He's a mountain!

42:26.586 --> 42:29.588
And after I'm a woman,
Jean-Claude and I are going to be married.

42:29.672 --> 42:32.633
- I'm going to be a June bride.
- He's a monster.

42:32.717 --> 42:36.053
Can you imagine what that guy
would look like in a movie?

42:43.728 --> 42:46.480
Yeah, yeah! Yeah!

42:47.856 --> 42:49.107
More neck.

42:52.153 --> 42:54.279
Mr. Johnson, congratulations on your victory.

42:54.364 --> 42:55.572
Thank you.

42:55.657 --> 42:58.408
- Did you bring my water?
- No, I'm not the water boy.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.410
I'm a movie director.

43:00.495 --> 43:03.247
- Movies? Like the <i>Mickey Mouse?</i>
- Sure.

43:03.331 --> 43:07.376
- I'll get you next week!
- Yeah, right. In your dreams!

43:08.795 --> 43:10.879
Tor... Uh, Mr. Johnson.

43:10.964 --> 43:13.882
You ever fancy the notion
of becoming an actor?

43:13.967 --> 43:15.926
Not good-looking enough.

43:16.010 --> 43:19.096
Well, I think you're quite handsome.

43:19.514 --> 43:21.223
Do my toes.

43:22.767 --> 43:26.270
So, anyway, I've got this new script,
<i>Bride Of The Atom.</i>

43:26.354 --> 43:29.523
And there's a part
I believe you're ideal for.

43:29.691 --> 43:32.567
Lobo. He's tough, he's a brute.

43:32.652 --> 43:35.779
But he's got a good heart.
At the end of the picture, he saves the girl.

43:36.863 --> 43:38.615
I like! When do movie shoot?

43:38.700 --> 43:40.617
Hopefully, very soon.

43:40.702 --> 43:43.120
I'm just waiting for the final okay
from my good pal at Warners, Mr. Feldman.

43:47.792 --> 43:51.295
- Wood Productions.
- <i>Eddie, help me.</i>

43:51.379 --> 43:54.923
- Bela?
- <i>Eddie, please come over.</i>

43:55.716 --> 43:57.718
Bela?

44:18.531 --> 44:20.454
Bela?

44:22.744 --> 44:24.661
Bela!

44:35.089 --> 44:36.715
Bela!

44:36.799 --> 44:38.425
Bela? What happened?

44:38.893 --> 44:40.219
Eddie.

44:41.304 --> 44:43.597
I didn't feel well.

44:45.808 --> 44:47.267
Come on, let me get you to the hospital.

44:47.352 --> 44:49.644
No hospital.

44:49.729 --> 44:52.064
Just take me to the couch.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.985
- Should I call a doctor?
- No.

44:57.070 --> 44:59.988
This happens all the time.

45:02.450 --> 45:05.786
Is there anything I can get for you?
Water or a blanket?

45:07.163 --> 45:09.122
Goulash.

45:10.792 --> 45:13.794
I don't know how to make goulash.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.717
Bela, what's in the needle?

45:20.802 --> 45:22.761
Morphine.

45:23.429 --> 45:25.472
With a Demerol chaser.

45:28.309 --> 45:33.021
Oh, Eddie. Eddie, I'm so broke.

45:34.273 --> 45:36.274
I don't know what I'm going to do.

45:40.655 --> 45:42.489
Don't worry, Bela.

45:44.283 --> 45:46.827
I won't let you down.

45:49.789 --> 45:52.124
Mr. Feldman? Ed Wood.

45:52.208 --> 45:55.252
Yeah, listen, I haven't been able to get through,
so I just showed up.

45:55.336 --> 45:57.295
Yeah! Right out front.

45:57.380 --> 45:59.756
So, we gonna be working together?

46:01.342 --> 46:04.845
Really? Worst film you ever saw.

46:04.929 --> 46:08.140
Well, my next one will be better.

46:08.224 --> 46:11.184
Hello. Hello.

46:13.436 --> 46:14.938
I'm no good.

46:15.022 --> 46:17.941
Oh, Ed, it was just one man's opinion.

46:18.025 --> 46:21.528
Bela needs a job.
I can't even get a film going.

46:21.612 --> 46:24.448
Of course I can't.
I made the worst movie of all time.

46:24.532 --> 46:26.450
Oh, that's ridiculous.

46:27.660 --> 46:30.579
All I wanna do is tell stories.

46:30.663 --> 46:33.498
The things that I find interesting.

46:33.583 --> 46:36.793
Well, maybe you're not
studio kind of material.

46:36.878 --> 46:39.838
Maybe you just need
to raise the money yourself.

46:42.592 --> 46:45.218
The movie is called <i>Bride Of The Atom.</i>

46:45.303 --> 46:48.305
It will star Bela Lugosi.

46:48.389 --> 46:50.974
There are quarter shares
available at $15,000 each.

46:51.350 --> 46:54.060
Yes, that's right.
The Bela Lugosi.

46:55.104 --> 46:57.481
He's still alive.

46:57.565 --> 47:01.193
Huh? Is he available Friday night?

47:01.277 --> 47:03.987
Well, gee, I suppose so. Why?

47:05.071 --> 47:08.074
"Greetings, I am the Count."

47:08.159 --> 47:11.286
"Greetings, I am Slick Slomopavitz,
Seeker of Adventure.

47:11.370 --> 47:15.081
"Audience laughs, applauds.
'Say, that's a kooky place to sleep.'"

47:15.291 --> 47:19.419
- "It is my home."
- "Oh, tract housing, huh? Laugh."

47:19.545 --> 47:21.172
"You need a new real estate agent."

47:22.256 --> 47:24.174
"I beg to differ.

47:24.258 --> 47:27.928
"This casket incap... incarpertate..."

47:28.012 --> 47:29.930
No, Bela, that's "incorporates."

47:30.014 --> 47:32.766
Look, why don't you just say,
"This casket has..."

47:33.059 --> 47:36.228
How do they expect a Hungarian
to pronounce this dialogue?

47:36.312 --> 47:39.231
This live television is madness!

47:39.315 --> 47:41.608
Furthermore, I predict

47:41.692 --> 47:44.986
by April 19, 1970,

47:45.071 --> 47:49.032
I predict men will have colonized Mars.

47:49.116 --> 47:51.284
Millions of people will live there.

47:51.953 --> 47:55.038
Wow! Ain't that somethin'?

47:58.459 --> 48:01.836
And now we take you
to a castle in Transylvania.

48:01.921 --> 48:06.925
Watch out.
The landlord's a real pain in the neck.

48:24.527 --> 48:27.904
Greetings! I am the Count!

48:27.989 --> 48:31.575
Greetings, pal!
I'm Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure!

48:32.952 --> 48:35.245
Hey, what a kooky place to sleep.

48:35.329 --> 48:37.831
Kind of reminds me of my house.
What a dump!

48:37.957 --> 48:40.834
Some places got a Murphy bed,
this place got a Murphy shower.

48:40.918 --> 48:43.420
I still don't know
where to hang the towels.

48:43.504 --> 48:45.422
I beg to differ.

48:45.506 --> 48:50.760
Beg to differ? A bloodsucker, right?
I'm talkin' about my towels.

48:55.016 --> 48:58.518
Greetings! I am the Count.

49:03.816 --> 49:04.934
Damn!

49:11.824 --> 49:15.535
A bum is what he is.
I told you we should've got Karloff!

49:19.040 --> 49:20.957
Ah, don't worry about it, Bela.
You're better than all this.

49:21.042 --> 49:22.542
I never said I could ad-lib.

49:22.627 --> 49:24.836
Forget it! We'll make our own movie
and you'll be a big star again.

49:26.380 --> 49:30.884
Mr. Lugosi, it is an unparalleled
privilege to meet you, sir.

49:30.968 --> 49:34.346
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Criswell.

49:34.430 --> 49:36.389
It's a pleasure.

49:36.474 --> 49:40.560
Ah, cheer up. Don't lose heart
over what happened tonight.

49:40.645 --> 49:45.065
I predict your next project
will be an outstanding success!

49:45.691 --> 49:47.567
Wow!

49:47.902 --> 49:49.736
And who may you be?

49:49.820 --> 49:51.864
Edward D. Wood, Jr.

49:52.948 --> 49:56.368
- The director of <i>Glen Or Glenda?</i>
- How'd you know?

49:56.452 --> 49:59.788
I am Criswell. I know all.

50:09.924 --> 50:12.592
And bingo!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

50:12.718 --> 50:16.680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis.

50:16.764 --> 50:18.682
Ed, another whiskey.

50:18.766 --> 50:20.684
Dagmar, a rum and coke?

50:20.768 --> 50:22.852
Moustapha and King are Chablis.

50:22.937 --> 50:25.980
Bela, would you like a wine?

50:26.315 --> 50:29.484
No. I never drink wine.

50:34.824 --> 50:39.202
Say, Cris, how'd you know we'd be
living on Mars by 1970?

50:39.286 --> 50:42.205
- I guessed.
- Really?

50:42.289 --> 50:44.249
I made it up.

50:44.333 --> 50:46.292
It's horse shit.

50:47.503 --> 50:50.422
Eddie, there's no such thing
as a psychic.

50:50.506 --> 50:54.467
People believe my folderol
because I wear a black tuxedo.

50:54.552 --> 50:57.554
- It's that easy?
- Eddie, we're in show biz.

50:57.638 --> 51:01.057
It's all about razzle-dazzle, appearances.

51:01.142 --> 51:04.894
If you look good and you talk well,
people will swallow anything.

51:13.362 --> 51:17.532
We are going to have the most
terrifying monster ever seen on film.

51:17.616 --> 51:21.911
A ghastly creature created
from an atomic mutation!

51:21.996 --> 51:23.913
I don't like scary movies.

51:23.998 --> 51:25.915
I like the ones with love stories.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.918
That's just what this movie is:
a heartbreaking romance.

51:29.003 --> 51:30.962
You're quite a specimen.

51:31.046 --> 51:33.882
- And you're going to be in the picture?
- Yeah. I play Lobo.

51:33.966 --> 51:38.470
I predict <i>Bride Of The Atom</i> will be
the biggest moneymaker of all time.

51:38.554 --> 51:42.515
And this is lovely starlet Dolores Fuller,
who will play Janet Lawton.

51:42.600 --> 51:45.935
My pleasure, ma'am.
Now, how much will this picture cost?

51:46.020 --> 51:49.439
Well, in a normal studio it'd be
about a million bucks

51:49.523 --> 51:52.484
with all their wasteful overhead
and fancy offices.

51:52.568 --> 51:55.028
But we're more efficient,
so we could bring it in at about 70 grand.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.990
Oh. Well, I shall certainly consider it.

51:59.074 --> 52:02.368
- Well, goodbye.
- Good night, Ed. Keep in touch.

52:02.453 --> 52:04.412
Goodbye.

52:07.249 --> 52:09.209
Well, Eddie, how'd we do?

52:09.293 --> 52:11.085
We didn't make a nickel.

52:12.046 --> 52:14.964
I cannot believe I'm in Hollywood.

52:15.049 --> 52:17.842
You know, Daddy didn't want me
to move out here.

52:19.094 --> 52:22.388
Ma'am, your bill comes to $2.20.

52:22.473 --> 52:25.433
Oh. Uh, okay. I hope you don't mind

52:25.518 --> 52:28.645
but all I have is a fifty.
I just came from my banker's.

52:28.729 --> 52:30.688
- That's all right.
- Thank you.

52:37.863 --> 52:40.240
Excuse me. You just moved here?

52:40.449 --> 52:43.576
Yes. Hollywood is, oh, so exciting.

52:43.661 --> 52:44.711
Isn't it?

52:45.663 --> 52:48.164
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
I'm Loretta King.

52:48.249 --> 52:50.416
Edward D. Wood, Jr.

52:50.501 --> 52:52.919
Hi. Would you like some water?

52:53.003 --> 52:54.003
No!

52:54.088 --> 52:56.506
No water. No liquids.

52:56.590 --> 52:58.716
I'm terribly allergic to them.

53:00.678 --> 53:03.596
You know, I work in Hollywood.
I'm a producer.

53:03.681 --> 53:05.598
Really? Wow!

53:05.683 --> 53:08.226
I would love to be involved in that.

53:08.310 --> 53:11.271
Is that right?
Well, maybe I can help you out.

53:11.355 --> 53:14.607
Have you ever thought about
investing in a motion picture?

53:14.859 --> 53:16.860
Perhaps a small amount of money.

53:16.944 --> 53:18.820
How much do your motion pictures cost?

53:19.071 --> 53:22.740
Well, my new one, I think,
would be about $60,000.

53:22.825 --> 53:26.870
That's all? That seems very reasonable
for an entire picture.

53:29.957 --> 53:32.917
Would you like to

53:33.002 --> 53:36.379
- have a look at the photoplay?
- Oh, sure.

53:38.507 --> 53:40.425
Oh, my.

53:40.509 --> 53:43.052
This is very interesting.

53:43.137 --> 53:46.055
Say, do you think it would be possible

53:46.140 --> 53:48.349
for me to maybe play one of these parts?

53:48.434 --> 53:51.394
Oh, you want to be an actress, too.
Well, of course.

53:51.478 --> 53:55.231
There's a couple of parts I can think of right now
that you might be perfect for.

53:55.316 --> 54:00.111
There's the secretary in the newspaper office,
the file clerk...

54:00.195 --> 54:02.906
Hmm. Those sound kind of small.

54:04.033 --> 54:06.701
Here's one that looks good, Janet Lawton.

54:08.370 --> 54:11.331
I'd sure like to play her.

54:11.415 --> 54:13.458
- Janet Lawton.
- Yes.

54:13.542 --> 54:16.502
Janet Lawton is clearly the part to play.

54:18.964 --> 54:21.674
Can't you just see me in the part?

54:27.389 --> 54:29.349
Yes!

54:29.433 --> 54:31.351
You'd be perfect.

54:33.646 --> 54:35.563
You bastard!

54:35.648 --> 54:39.776
You two-timing, dress-wearing son of a bitch!

54:39.860 --> 54:42.820
Honey, it was the only way
I could get the movie made!

54:42.905 --> 54:44.822
Who do you think's been paying the rent?

54:44.907 --> 54:48.868
Who's been helping you type your scripts
and do all your grunt work?

54:48.953 --> 54:50.495
I am sorry!
What did you want me to say?

54:50.579 --> 54:52.038
You were supposed to say,

54:52.122 --> 54:56.918
"No. I wrote that part
for my girlfriend Dolores!"

54:58.295 --> 55:01.756
Snowball, there are plenty of other parts.

55:01.840 --> 55:04.425
Like what?

55:05.928 --> 55:07.680
The secretary, the file clerk.

55:08.764 --> 55:11.724
You asshole!

55:14.895 --> 55:18.314
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory,
so it should be real impressive

55:18.399 --> 55:20.775
just like one of those
"Mad Scientist" movies.

55:21.026 --> 55:24.153
I want test tubes, beakers and one
of those electrical things that buzzes.

55:24.238 --> 55:26.990
- You mean a Tesla coil?
- Fine. Whatever. Hop to it!

55:27.074 --> 55:29.033
Right! Right.

55:30.786 --> 55:32.745
- Eddie?
- Yes?

55:32.830 --> 55:36.666
- Which dress do you like better?
- Hmm. I don't know.

55:36.750 --> 55:41.129
Say, Bill, which dress works better for you,
the red one or the green one?

55:41.213 --> 55:44.173
- Which one is the red one?
- What do you mean?

55:44.258 --> 55:47.635
I mean, I can't see the difference,
I'm color blind.

55:47.720 --> 55:49.887
But I kinda like the dark gray one.

55:52.099 --> 55:56.644
At Universal, we used to shoot
one or two scenes a day.

55:56.729 --> 55:59.731
But Eddie can knock off 20, 30.

55:59.815 --> 56:02.442
- He's incredible!
- And action!

56:06.697 --> 56:10.241
Okay, you're Dr. Eric Vornoff

56:10.325 --> 56:12.243
and you're upset.

56:12.327 --> 56:13.786
You've worked very hard
on this experiment

56:13.871 --> 56:16.539
and you don't want to see it fail.

56:16.623 --> 56:18.541
No, you're not that upset.

56:18.625 --> 56:22.003
You wanna keep moving.
You wanna go through that door.

56:25.841 --> 56:27.800
And cut! Beautiful.

56:27.885 --> 56:30.470
Print it.
Let's move immediately to scene 52.

56:30.554 --> 56:32.472
- Tor, you in place?
- Yeah.

56:32.556 --> 56:34.849
- Great. Roll camera!
- Rolling. Slate.

56:35.100 --> 56:36.394
Cue rainstorm.

56:37.978 --> 56:39.896
And action, Tor.

56:43.025 --> 56:46.152
Okay. You're Lobo.

56:46.236 --> 56:48.154
You're upset.

56:48.238 --> 56:52.200
You've worked very hard
helping Dr. Vornoff with this experiment.

56:52.284 --> 56:55.203
You don't wanna see it fail.

56:55.287 --> 56:57.246
No, no. You're not that upset.

56:57.331 --> 57:00.291
You wanna keep moving.
You've got to get through that door.

57:06.423 --> 57:08.174
And cut! Perfect!

57:08.425 --> 57:11.385
- Print it. Let's move on.
- Don't you wanna do another take, Ed?

57:11.470 --> 57:14.430
Looks like big baldy had a little trouble
gettin' through the door.

57:14.515 --> 57:16.474
No, it's fine. It's real.

57:16.642 --> 57:20.853
You know, in actuality, Lobo would have
to struggle with that problem every day.

57:21.188 --> 57:25.108
All right, people, let's get ready.
Actors! I must have my actors!

57:25.192 --> 57:26.442
There you are.

57:26.527 --> 57:29.278
Loretta, Tor, I wanna explain this scene,
it's a little complicated, but...

57:29.363 --> 57:31.815
Bela, you'll be sitting there. Okay?

57:32.699 --> 57:34.617
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.

57:34.701 --> 57:36.953
One of them burned me
on <i>The Return Of Chandu.</i>

57:37.037 --> 57:38.704
All right.

57:39.164 --> 57:41.791
- Then you'll be sitting there.
- Good.

57:41.875 --> 57:44.168
Great. All right, gang, here's the scene.

57:44.253 --> 57:47.630
Loretta, you're in a trance,
you glide in and get on the operating table.

57:47.714 --> 57:50.925
Now, Tor, you're supposed to tie her down,
but you have an angora fetish

57:51.009 --> 57:54.137
and when you rub that swatch of angora,
it makes you refuse.

57:54.221 --> 57:58.182
So then Bela has to discipline you.
All right? Great! Let's do it!

58:00.018 --> 58:01.936
Action!

58:07.401 --> 58:09.944
Strap her to the table.

58:12.447 --> 58:14.824
Do as I command you!

58:16.702 --> 58:20.037
I'll teach you to disobey me!

58:20.122 --> 58:22.081
You will obey!

58:22.791 --> 58:24.134
Strap her in!

58:24.918 --> 58:27.920
Strap her in! I command you!

58:28.005 --> 58:30.923
- Wood! Your check bounced.
- I'll get you the money later.

58:31.008 --> 58:33.593
- No, I need it now.
- I'll teach you to disobey me!

58:33.677 --> 58:35.636
Cut!

58:36.138 --> 58:39.307
I am terribly sorry to bother you
while you're shooting

58:39.391 --> 58:42.351
but the guy that owns the stage
needs his money.

58:42.436 --> 58:45.771
Well, then, you should pay him,
shouldn't you?

58:45.856 --> 58:48.232
Yes. Exactly.

58:53.947 --> 58:55.907
I kind of need it now.

58:58.994 --> 59:02.455
What are you looking at me
like that for?

59:02.539 --> 59:05.708
I already gave you my three hundred.

59:05.792 --> 59:07.710
Right.

59:07.794 --> 59:10.463
And now I need the other sixty thousand.

59:10.672 --> 59:13.299
What other sixty thousand?

59:15.177 --> 59:18.971
The other sixty thousand
you said you'd give to me.

59:19.306 --> 59:21.515
You misunderstood, Eddie.

59:21.600 --> 59:25.228
I gave you everything I have in the world,
three hundred dollars.

59:41.954 --> 59:44.914
Well, here we go again.

59:44.998 --> 59:47.375
Let me tell ya, ya can't lose.

59:47.459 --> 59:50.628
It's scary. And if you don't like that,
it's romantic.

59:50.712 --> 59:53.673
Bela Lugosi will portray Dr. Eric Vornoff.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.391
And lovely, lovely, lovely
ingénue Loretta King

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:06.102
is reporter Janet Lawton.

01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:09.188
- I don't know. Lugosi looks pretty old.
- Huh?

01:00:10.691 --> 01:00:12.692
Which role does Vampira play?

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:15.528
Vampira? Why do you ask?

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:17.863
She's standing right over there.

01:00:20.701 --> 01:00:23.160
Well, she plays...

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.665
Excuse me one minute.

01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:31.127
Pardon me. Miss Vampira?

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:34.171
- Yes?
- You don't know me, but I'm Ed Wood.

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:37.633
I'm a film producer and I'm currently in production
on a science fiction piece

01:00:37.718 --> 01:00:40.094
with Bela Lugosi
and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson.

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:42.221
I don't understand.
Do you want my autograph?

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.433
No.

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:48.227
No, I think my film is perfect for you.

01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:50.646
You want me to show it
on my TV programme.

01:00:50.731 --> 01:00:52.315
I have nothing to do with that.

01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:54.150
You should call the station manager
at Channel 7.

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:55.318
No, no. No, no, no, no.

01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:59.488
I don't want you to show the movie,
I want you to be in it. Let me explain.

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:02.491
We started shooting,
but after three days we got shut down.

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:04.994
Now we're having a backers party
to raise some more money.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.370
So I thought perhaps
you'd like to come over

01:01:06.455 --> 01:01:08.497
just to say "howdy"
to some of the backers.

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:11.459
Look, I'm with some friends
and we're about to eat.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:13.753
Please! It would just take one second.

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:15.463
Come over and meet the backers.

01:01:15.547 --> 01:01:17.673
There is a really nice dentist from Oxnard.

01:01:17.758 --> 01:01:20.301
Look, buddy, I've got real offers
from real studios.

01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:23.262
I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.
Forget it.

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:27.350
Miss Vampira!

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:29.894
- Please.
- Oh! Let's go.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:34.899
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
Let's get out of here.

01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:37.068
Yeah, I think you're right.

01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:41.280
Thank you, folks, for comin' tonight,
but we better go.

01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:45.159
And then Dr. Vornoff falls into the pit

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:48.371
and his own octopus attacks and eats him.

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:49.831
The end.

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:54.293
- Well, that's quite a story.
- Yes.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:58.047
So, uh, you made the movie

01:01:58.298 --> 01:02:00.716
and now you wanna make it again?

01:02:00.801 --> 01:02:02.676
No.

01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:06.722
We shot 10 minutes of the movie,
and now we're looking for completion funds.

01:02:06.807 --> 01:02:08.808
Oh, son, you're too vague.

01:02:10.718 --> 01:02:11.769
Billy Bob!

01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:15.815
You're cuttin' 'em too lean.

01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:18.067
Mr. McCoy.

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:20.986
How can I make you happy?

01:02:23.365 --> 01:02:25.199
Okay.

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:27.076
Two things.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:32.415
Number one: I want the movie
to end with a big explosion.

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:36.502
Sky full of smoke.

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:40.172
Yes.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:43.342
But it ends with Dr. Vornoff
falling into the pit.

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:45.761
Not anymore.

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:47.972
Number two:

01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:49.640
I got a son.

01:02:50.517 --> 01:02:53.519
He's a little slow, but a good boy.

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:58.983
And somethin' tells me
he'd make a helluva leadin' man.

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:05.364
Sounds perfect.

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:07.491
This is unbelievable.

01:03:07.576 --> 01:03:10.411
I woulda bet a million bucks
that Ed wouldn't finish this picture.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:13.414
Yeah, well, it ain't finished yet, kid.
Anything can happen.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.750
Stay out of scratching distance.

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:19.128
Poodle, you made it.
I wasn't sure you got my message.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:20.379
Well, of course I made it.

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:23.799
- Today's the file clerk's big scene.
- That's right.

01:03:23.884 --> 01:03:26.635
I see the usual gang of misfits
and dope addicts are here.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.555
- Janet, I want you...
- Say, who's the lug?

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:34.685
I want you staying away
from the old Willows place.

01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:37.730
Why, that's Tony McCoy.
He will be portraying Lieutenant Dick Craig.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:39.064
Really.

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:43.110
- How much money did he put up?
- None. But his dad gave me 50 grand.

01:03:43.195 --> 01:03:46.197
Hmm. Wood Productions,
the mark of quality.

01:03:46.281 --> 01:03:49.575
Listen, the movie's getting made,
that's all that matters.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.620
- Hello, Harry.
- Oh, hi, Dolores.

01:03:52.704 --> 01:03:55.206
Oh! You're Dolores.

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:57.625
I've heard so much about you.

01:03:57.709 --> 01:04:00.628
I'm Loretta King.
Oh, here, take the chair.

01:04:00.712 --> 01:04:02.171
Oh, don't be silly.
Let Harry finish.

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:03.714
You still need some more work.

01:04:04.966 --> 01:04:06.884
No. I'm finished.

01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:10.346
- All I needed was a touch-up.
- Hmm. That mole still shows.

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:13.516
Uh, ladies! You both look fine.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:16.977
Why don't we talk about the scene?

01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:19.271
Okay, Janet Lawton has just discovered

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:21.857
that Dr. Vornoff bought
the old Willows estate

01:04:21.942 --> 01:04:24.318
so now she wants to prove that
all the monster stories are true.

01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:26.529
Well, Eddie, what's my motivation?

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:31.534
You're the file clerk. You're running
into the next room and bump into Janet.

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:33.077
What is our relationship?

01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:36.372
Are we good friends,
or is she just a casual acquaintance?

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:40.042
Dolores, I have five days
to complete this picture.

01:04:40.126 --> 01:04:42.086
Don't get goofy on me.

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:46.215
Action!

01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:51.387
- Hi, Janet.
- Oh, hi, Marge.

01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:54.765
- Janet, still on the monster hunt?
- What do you think?

01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:57.476
I think the boss has been
looking for you all day.

01:04:57.561 --> 01:05:00.521
Something about the police
wanting those monster stories 86'd.

01:05:00.981 --> 01:05:04.066
- You've got the whole town in a panic.
- I can't hear you.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:05.609
I said, you've got the who...

01:05:05.694 --> 01:05:08.112
I know what you said,
but I can't hear you.

01:05:09.197 --> 01:05:11.574
I get it. See ya later.

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:16.495
And cut! That was perfect.

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:19.290
Of course it was.

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:22.126
Bravo! Bravo!

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:25.170
- <i>Magnifico.</i>
- Cris, you made it. Thanks a lot.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:28.173
Naturally. Always happy to help
with a little larceny.

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.593
All right, everybody,
that's it for today.

01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:34.179
The prop crew has a little errand to run.
Paul. Connie.

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:50.195
Darn. I thought they kept this open.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.323
Lobo will fix.

01:05:57.495 --> 01:06:00.205
Good boy.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:03.617
- Wow!
- This place gives me the creeps.

01:06:03.671 --> 01:06:07.630
- Let's get the hell outta here.
- Not so fast. Not 'til we get it down.

01:06:07.714 --> 01:06:10.215
There it is. Paul, go unhook it.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.217
Right.

01:06:14.346 --> 01:06:16.263
Fantastic.

01:06:16.348 --> 01:06:18.682
It's beautiful.

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:21.393
- You sure this is gonna work?
- Yes.

01:06:23.311 --> 01:06:24.480
You sure?

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:26.398
Yes, hurry. Do it.

01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:39.411
My God!

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:43.082
We killed him.

01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:48.921
Tor?

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:53.676
Better than wrestling.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.678
Lights!

01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:59.098
"Now, Janet, I want you stayin' away

01:06:59.224 --> 01:07:01.892
"from that old Willows place. I want...

01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:04.353
"Now, Janet, I..."

01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:06.438
- Great.
- "I want you..."

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:08.482
- Connie!
- "I want you staying away..."

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:12.069
- The octopus has to live in the lake.
- This is kind of a stream.

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:13.779
No! It has to be underwater.

01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:16.573
Let me look at this. Okay.

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:20.577
Go set up by the lake.

01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:23.789
Eddie. I'm so tired.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:26.458
I don't know if I can handle
a night shoot.

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:28.086
Nonsense. You look great.

01:07:31.131 --> 01:07:33.048
All right, look.

01:07:33.133 --> 01:07:35.551
Why don't you have a nice nap
and we'll shoot around you for a little while.

01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:38.971
- Thanks, buddy.
- You're welcome.

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:41.306
All right, you kids.

01:07:57.031 --> 01:08:00.409
Hey, this is looking fantastic!

01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:02.411
Paul, where's the octopus motor?

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:07.624
- What octopus motor?
- To make his legs move.

01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:11.211
Don't blame me!

01:08:11.296 --> 01:08:13.297
You didn't say anything about a motor
when I was on the ceiling!

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:18.510
What's he talking...

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:26.100
Paul lost the octopus motor.

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:29.854
All right, let's shoot this fucker.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.232
Great.

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:34.568
Where do I go?

01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:37.779
- You'll be fighting with the octopus.
- Out there?

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:40.866
- Yes.
- What happened to the stream?

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:43.952
Well, this is gonna look a lot better.

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:47.413
We have to match it to the stock footage
of the octopus underwater.

01:08:48.582 --> 01:08:50.709
Aw, for Christ's sake.

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:58.216
- Goddamn, it's cold!
- It'll warm up once you're in it.

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:00.135
Fuck you! You come out here!

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:03.388
Hey! Throw me that whiskey!

01:09:13.398 --> 01:09:15.234
How do you turn this on?

01:09:16.694 --> 01:09:20.656
Well, somebody misplaced the octopus motor

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:24.076
so when you get in there and fight with him,
shake his legs around.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.745
Looks like he's killin' ya. Okay.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:31.166
You know I turned down <i>Frankenstein?</i>

01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:35.295
- What?
- After I did <i>Dracula</i>

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:39.258
the studio offered me <i>Frankenstein,</i>
but I turned it down.

01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:43.303
Part wasn't sexy enough.

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:46.849
Too degrading for a big star like me.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:52.020
Bela, I have 25 scenes to shoot tonight.

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:56.108
Oh. Sorry.
Don't let me slow you down.

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:59.528
Okay. All right.

01:09:59.737 --> 01:10:01.655
All right.

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:05.951
All right, let's put it on film!

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:08.453
- Camera!
- We're rolling!

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:11.290
- Sound!
- Ed, we don't have sound.

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:14.626
And action!

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:40.152
And cut!

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:44.656
That was perfect!

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.284
Come on! Come on, troops!

01:10:47.368 --> 01:10:50.329
Have a nice cup o' joe,
you'll feel much better.

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:52.331
All right. All right, Harry.

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:55.375
Mr. Wood?
I only got one hour of sleep last night.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:59.755
Yeah, well, I got no sleep, and I feel great.
Go get' em, kid, go get 'em.

01:10:59.839 --> 01:11:02.132
- I'm gettin' too old for this.
- Great work, Bill.

01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:04.343
Go ahead. Go get 'em.

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:06.345
Be careful. Don't hurt him.

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:09.348
Don't scratch the tentacles.

01:11:11.935 --> 01:11:13.769
Bela,

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.772
I wanna thank you again for last night.

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:19.775
That's fine, Eddie.
All in the line of duty.

01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:24.905
No, no, I want you to know how much
I appreciate all you've done for me.

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:26.114
A great man like yourself

01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:28.575
shouldn't have to be wandering
through the muck at 4:00 a.m.

01:11:29.369 --> 01:11:32.038
Well, there are not a lot of fellas
I'd do it for.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.459
Say, I wrote something special for ya.

01:11:37.543 --> 01:11:41.755
I got to thinkin' about
all the sacrifices you've made and I...

01:11:41.839 --> 01:11:44.383
Well, I wrote you a...

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:47.386
A new final speech.

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:52.683
Well, this is quite a scene, Eddie.

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:56.144
I know it's a lot to give you
at the last minute, Bela, but...

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:58.313
These lines...

01:11:58.398 --> 01:12:00.941
I'll have no problem remembering.

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:04.736
Great.

01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:08.782
All right, kids, let's knock 'em dead.

01:12:09.867 --> 01:12:13.578
My dear Professor Strowski,

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:18.583
twenty years ago I was banned
from my homeland.

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:21.753
I was classed as a madman, a charlatan.

01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:25.716
Outlawed in the world of science

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:29.428
which previously honored me as a genius.

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:32.681
Now here

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:36.727
in this forsaken jungle hell,

01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:39.771
I have proven that I am all right!

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:41.773
Yes!

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:44.943
The authorities have learned
how correct your findings were.

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:48.030
So I am here

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:50.073
to bring you home.

01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:57.581
Home?

01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:01.460
I have no home.

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:04.588
Hunted.

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:07.174
Despised.

01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:09.760
Living like an animal.

01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:13.221
The jungle is my home.

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:16.391
But I shall show the world

01:13:16.476 --> 01:13:19.561
that I can be its master!

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:23.899
I shall perfect my own race of people,

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:26.526
a race of atomic supermen

01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:29.321
that will conquer the world!

01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:39.414
Cut.

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:42.501
That's a wrap.

01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:53.428
<i>Glen Or Glenda?</i>
Now, that was a hell of a picture.

01:13:53.513 --> 01:13:56.306
Yeah, but this new one is gonna be
a million times better.

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:58.683
Is that possible?

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:05.732
Mr. Bunny, what's wrong?

01:14:05.817 --> 01:14:08.777
I heard you were becoming a lady.

01:14:09.529 --> 01:14:11.488
Oh, that.

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:14.783
Mexico

01:14:14.867 --> 01:14:17.202
was

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:18.662
a nightmare.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:24.334
We got into a car accident,
he was killed.

01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:27.337
Our luggage

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:28.839
was stolen.

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:32.634
The surgeon turned out to be

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:34.219
a quack.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.681
If it hadn't been for these men,

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:42.144
I don't know

01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:44.563
how I would've

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:46.439
survived.

01:15:07.753 --> 01:15:09.671
Oh, wow!

01:16:13.236 --> 01:16:15.862
You people are insane!

01:16:15.947 --> 01:16:17.864
You're wasting your lives making shit!

01:16:17.949 --> 01:16:21.034
Nobody cares!
These movies are terrible!

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:30.502
Dolores!

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.842
Ed, it's over.
I need a normal life.

01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:43.014
- Did you really mean those things you...
- I'm tired of living like this.

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:44.641
But, Poodle...

01:16:44.725 --> 01:16:47.060
I just stuck it out
so you could finish your movie

01:16:47.144 --> 01:16:48.687
and now that it's done, so am I.

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:04.703
<i>Oh, that was so scary,
it gave me goose bumps.</i>

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:09.416
<i>No, dummy, I didn't say "goose,"
I said "goose bumps."</i>

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:14.796
Well, be sure to join me next week
for <i>The Mummy's Curse.</i>

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.465
Until then, pleasant nightmares.

01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:31.771
Okay, folks, we're off the air.

01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:33.690
That was a good show.

01:17:33.774 --> 01:17:36.276
God, this show needs better jokes.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.445
- You got a phone call.
- Who is it?

01:17:38.529 --> 01:17:41.239
I don't know.

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:45.201
- Hello.
- Vampira? Ed Wood here.

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:47.245
- <i>Who?</i>
- Ed Wood.

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:49.247
<i>Remember, I met you at the Brown Derby?</i>

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:50.415
Oh, yeah, you.

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:52.292
Listen, I was wondering if you'd like to

01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:54.002
go out sometime,
grab some dinner maybe.

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:56.421
You mean a date?
I thought you were a fag.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.006
No, I'm just a transvestite.

01:17:58.215 --> 01:18:00.175
<i>So, how's about Friday night?</i>

01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:03.011
Look, you seem like a nice guy,
but you're just not my type.

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:06.639
<i>But keep in touch.
Let me know when your movie opens.</i>

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:16.066
Hello?

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:19.069
<i>Eddie, help me.</i>

01:18:19.153 --> 01:18:21.112
Bela?

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.255
Bela.

01:18:42.167 --> 01:18:43.301
Bela!

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:49.182
What do you want?

01:18:50.851 --> 01:18:53.228
You called me. Remember?

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:58.149
What are you doing, Bela?

01:18:58.275 --> 01:19:00.193
I'm going to kill myself.

01:19:00.777 --> 01:19:02.987
My gosh, what happened?

01:19:06.867 --> 01:19:08.018
Eddie.

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:14.207
I got a letter from the government.

01:19:14.291 --> 01:19:16.501
They're canceling my

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:18.253
unemployment.

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:21.673
It's all I've got.

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:25.260
Without it, I can't pay the rent.

01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:27.470
Don't you have any savings?

01:19:28.347 --> 01:19:31.349
Eddie, I'm obsolete.

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:35.353
I have nothing to live for.

01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:38.857
Tonight, I shall die.

01:19:44.155 --> 01:19:46.072
Eddie!

01:19:46.157 --> 01:19:48.117
You should come with me.

01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:52.537
- I don't think that's such a good idea.
- It's a wonderful idea.

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:55.874
It'll be wonderful!
We'll be at peace!

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:59.085
In the afterlife,
you don't have to worry about finding work.

01:19:59.170 --> 01:20:01.296
Bela,

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.339
I'm on your side.

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:07.010
Gimme the gun.

01:20:08.721 --> 01:20:10.889
If you give me the gun

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:12.724
I'll make you a drink.

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:16.644
What are you drinking, Bela?

01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:18.646
Formaldehyde.

01:20:18.731 --> 01:20:20.940
Straight up, or on the rocks?

01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:37.665
Eddie.

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:39.709
I'm sorry.

01:20:41.545 --> 01:20:43.505
I'm so sorry.

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:45.840
Don't worry, Bela.

01:20:45.925 --> 01:20:50.011
- I'm sorry, Eddie.
- Everything will be okay.

01:20:59.437 --> 01:21:01.356
Oh, my goodness,
you gave me the willies!

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.441
You look like that Dracula guy.

01:21:04.527 --> 01:21:07.529
My name is Bela Lugosi

01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:09.781
and I wish to commit myself.

01:21:10.115 --> 01:21:12.784
For what reason?

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:17.872
I have been a drug addict for 20 years.

01:21:17.957 --> 01:21:19.916
I need help.

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:08.923
Is that angora?

01:22:09.008 --> 01:22:11.384
Um, yes.

01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:16.848
Don't you think angora
has a tactile sensuality

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:19.309
lacking in all other clothing?

01:22:19.393 --> 01:22:21.311
Yeah, I suppose.

01:22:21.395 --> 01:22:23.605
It is awfully expensive.

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:26.858
Well, it's made from specially-bred rabbits

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:28.860
that live in the Himalayas.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.822
Say, what are you,
an angora wholesaler?

01:22:32.906 --> 01:22:37.035
No.

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:41.873
I'm in pictures.

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.795
I'm a director, writer,
actor and producer.

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:50.798
Aw, come on.
Nobody does all that.

01:22:50.883 --> 01:22:52.800
Oh, yes, they do.
Two people.

01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:54.927
Orson Welles and me.

01:22:55.012 --> 01:22:56.971
Wow.

01:22:57.056 --> 01:23:00.391
- Whatcha makin'?
- Booties. For my father.

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:02.061
Gets cold in the hospital.

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:06.689
- Has he been here long?
- This is my thirteenth pair.

01:23:09.108 --> 01:23:10.193
Excuse me.

01:23:12.446 --> 01:23:14.238
Excuse me, Doctor.

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:16.824
I'm with Mr. Lugosi.
How is he?

01:23:16.909 --> 01:23:20.286
Well, there's a lot of junk in his system
for such an old man.

01:23:20.371 --> 01:23:22.288
Apparently he was addicted to morphine.

01:23:22.373 --> 01:23:25.583
He tried to kick that
and he got readdicted to methadone.

01:23:25.668 --> 01:23:28.628
- Is he gonna be okay?
- We'll do our best.

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:37.387
- Hi, Lillian.
- Hi, Ed. He's got a lot of visitors today.

01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:38.263
He does?

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:41.265
Smile. That's it!

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:43.267
- Hey! Hey!
- One more picture, sir?

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:45.186
Do the doctors say
you're gonna get outta here?

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:46.312
Freaks!

01:23:46.397 --> 01:23:48.523
Get outta here! Get outta here!

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:51.526
What is wrong with you people?
Come on, trash barrel!

01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:53.569
Hey!

01:23:53.654 --> 01:23:55.571
Bela, what happened?

01:23:55.656 --> 01:23:58.282
Eddie, why did you chase them?

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:02.620
After all these years,
the press is finally interested again in Bela Lugosi.

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:04.706
Bela,

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:08.334
those people are parasites,
they just wanna exploit you.

01:24:08.627 --> 01:24:11.379
Fine. Let them.

01:24:11.755 --> 01:24:14.382
There is no such thing
as bad press, Eddie.

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:19.178
Man from New York even said
he's putting me on the front page.

01:24:20.514 --> 01:24:23.143
First celebrity ever to check into rehab.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:29.313
When I get out of here

01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:31.315
I will be healthy,

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.484
strong,

01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:35.820
primed for my comeback...

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:50.001
Hello again.

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:52.462
- Hi.
- You look beat.

01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:55.339
No, I'm fine. How's your father?

01:24:55.966 --> 01:24:58.926
Better. Thank you for asking.
And your friend?

01:25:01.813 --> 01:25:03.014
Not good.

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:08.686
Well, I made him some booties
to cheer him up.

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:13.524
They're black, to match his cape.

01:25:17.279 --> 01:25:20.198
Say, have you always
lived in Los Angeles?

01:25:20.324 --> 01:25:22.909
No, I'm from back east.
Poughkeepsie.

01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:26.996
You know, all-American small town,
everybody knows everybody,

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.999
my dad worked for the post office,
I was a Boy Scout.

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:32.877
- Did you find it boring?
- No, not at all.

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:35.004
I had my comic books and pulp magazines.

01:25:35.088 --> 01:25:37.048
Used to listen to radio dramas constantly.

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:38.174
I love those shows.

01:25:38.258 --> 01:25:40.218
- <i>The Shadow, Inner Sanctum.</i>
- Yes.

01:25:40.594 --> 01:25:42.136
And <i>The Mercury Theater</i>
with Orson Welles.

01:25:43.639 --> 01:25:46.390
Boy, you know, every Saturday afternoon
me and my dad

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:49.393
marched down the street in our uniform
to the little movie theater.

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:51.562
Oh, the spook house!

01:26:27.474 --> 01:26:30.268
You're not gonna believe
the first picture I ever saw.

01:26:30.519 --> 01:26:32.311
It was your friend's... <i>Dracula.</i>

01:26:32.396 --> 01:26:34.981
That's incredible,
that's the first picture I ever saw.

01:26:35.065 --> 01:26:36.357
That is incredible.

01:26:36.441 --> 01:26:38.860
You know, I had to sleep
with the lights on for a week.

01:26:38.944 --> 01:26:40.361
I had to for a month.

01:26:40.445 --> 01:26:43.114
But I never missed a Lugosi picture
after that one.

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:47.869
A few years ago I actually saw him
do <i>Dracula</i> live.

01:26:47.953 --> 01:26:49.912
It was much scarier in person.

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:54.625
Oh. We're stuck.

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:04.135
Kathy,

01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:09.432
I'm about to tell you something that
I never told any girl on a first date.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.478
But I think it's important that you know

01:27:21.028 --> 01:27:23.070
I like to wear women's clothes.

01:27:25.866 --> 01:27:29.035
- Huh?
- I like to wear women's clothes.

01:27:30.287 --> 01:27:33.247
Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps.

01:27:34.333 --> 01:27:36.709
It's just something I do.

01:27:36.793 --> 01:27:40.755
Yes, I can't believe I'm telling you this,
but I really like you

01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:44.592
and I don't want it getting
in the way down the road.

01:27:44.676 --> 01:27:48.763
Does this mean
you don't like sex with girls?

01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:51.390
No, I love sex with girls.

01:27:57.731 --> 01:27:59.690
Okay.

01:28:01.318 --> 01:28:02.401
Okay?

01:28:04.863 --> 01:28:06.989
Okay.

01:28:18.001 --> 01:28:22.338
You see, we thought that Mr. Lugosi
was insured through his union.

01:28:22.422 --> 01:28:23.798
Isn't he?

01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:26.634
No, they say his eligibility
ran out years ago.

01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:31.973
Look, Doctor,

01:28:32.057 --> 01:28:34.558
he doesn't have any money.

01:28:34.685 --> 01:28:38.020
But I'll give you everything I've got,
a few hundred dollars.

01:28:38.105 --> 01:28:42.525
That won't even begin to cover it.
He's gonna have to leave.

01:28:46.822 --> 01:28:50.032
Bela? Bela, wake up.

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:54.161
I've got some great news.

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:56.789
The doctor says you're all better,
you can go home now.

01:28:58.625 --> 01:29:00.084
Really?

01:29:00.919 --> 01:29:02.628
I don't feel so great.

01:29:03.005 --> 01:29:06.590
No? Well, you look just peachy.

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:09.510
And, uh, the tests came back fine.

01:29:09.594 --> 01:29:12.555
Come on, let's get up.

01:29:13.598 --> 01:29:15.808
Here we go.

01:29:15.892 --> 01:29:19.103
Attaboy. Good.

01:29:26.403 --> 01:29:28.404
Eddie,

01:29:28.488 --> 01:29:31.615
I want to make another picture.

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.618
When are we going to make another picture?

01:29:34.745 --> 01:29:38.289
Oh... Soon, Bela. Very soon.

01:29:46.131 --> 01:29:47.966
This is so exciting.

01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:51.052
Another production.

01:29:51.136 --> 01:29:53.095
Isn't it?

01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:57.266
So, Eddie, shouldn't we
have a sound crew?

01:29:57.684 --> 01:30:00.686
Uh, no, no, because this
is just second unit stuff.

01:30:00.771 --> 01:30:03.814
We're gonna do the main footage later.
All right?

01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:05.775
So, what's this scene about?

01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:07.943
Um...

01:30:09.071 --> 01:30:11.322
You're a very important
and respected man.

01:30:11.615 --> 01:30:14.200
And you're leaving your house,
you're in a hurry.

01:30:14.284 --> 01:30:17.453
You're on your way to
a big social brouhaha. Okay?

01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:21.248
Eddie. What if I'm not in so big a hurry?

01:30:21.333 --> 01:30:24.251
What if I take a moment to slow down,

01:30:24.336 --> 01:30:26.754
to savor the beauty of life,

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:30.758
to smell a budding flower?

01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:33.761
That's great. That is great.

01:30:33.845 --> 01:30:36.013
Let's do a take. Okay?

01:30:39.142 --> 01:30:40.976
Ed, I'm really busy.

01:30:41.061 --> 01:30:42.269
What do you want now?

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:44.396
I was calling to see
if you'd like to attend

01:30:44.481 --> 01:30:47.024
the world premiere of my new movie,
<i>Bride Of The Monster.</i>

01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:48.859
Didn't you just make one
called <i>Bride Of The Atom?</i>

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:50.444
Yes, it's the same film.

01:30:50.529 --> 01:30:52.905
But the distributor wanted a punchier title.

01:30:52.989 --> 01:30:54.490
Come on, it's gonna be a big event,

01:30:54.574 --> 01:30:57.034
Bela, Tor and Cris are coming.
You'll have fun!

01:30:59.729 --> 01:31:00.955
I can't see.

01:31:01.039 --> 01:31:03.207
These contact lenses are hurting.

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:05.543
My eyes are killin' me.

01:31:05.794 --> 01:31:07.545
Don't worry. We're almost there.

01:31:15.061 --> 01:31:16.054
Hi.

01:31:16.638 --> 01:31:20.641
Right in there. Thank God you're here.
They're tearing up the place.

01:31:22.018 --> 01:31:24.103
Come on, come on.

01:31:24.187 --> 01:31:26.105
Come on, this way.

01:31:29.141 --> 01:31:30.276
Come on!

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.319
Come on!

01:31:32.404 --> 01:31:34.613
I've never been to a movie premiere before!

01:31:46.585 --> 01:31:48.794
Well, go knock 'em dead.

01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:05.769
<i>At the stroke of midnight,</i>

01:32:06.062 --> 01:32:08.397
<i>the witching hour,</i>

01:32:08.481 --> 01:32:11.025
<i>the ghouls arise</i>

01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:12.985
<i>from the dead!</i>

01:32:21.411 --> 01:32:24.371
- Hey, Vampira, how 'bout a little love!
- Fuck off!

01:32:24.456 --> 01:32:26.008
One of them stole my wallet!

01:32:33.006 --> 01:32:34.340
- I can't see!
- Get off me!

01:32:34.424 --> 01:32:35.549
Let's go!

01:32:35.634 --> 01:32:36.853
I gotta save 'em!

01:32:39.137 --> 01:32:40.554
Get your heads down!

01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:42.765
Come on, let's go!
We're getting the heck outta here!

01:32:43.849 --> 01:32:45.226
Can't see!

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:48.062
I can't see anymore!

01:32:53.276 --> 01:32:56.028
Hey, come on! Let's split!

01:33:04.162 --> 01:33:05.256
Taxi!

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.082
Stop!

01:33:08.166 --> 01:33:10.251
Get in! Come on!
Go on, get in!

01:33:20.011 --> 01:33:22.513
Now, that was a premiere.

01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:33.107
Eddie,

01:33:33.191 --> 01:33:34.859
last night was quite a romp.

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:37.903
Did you see that kid
grab Vampira's boobies?

01:33:37.988 --> 01:33:42.283
I envied him.
Hell, I envied you, too.

01:33:42.367 --> 01:33:47.037
A girlfriend who would jump
in front of a car like that.

01:33:47.122 --> 01:33:49.790
Yes, she is quite something.

01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:52.042
None of my wives would have.

01:33:55.547 --> 01:33:59.300
Eddie, I want to thank you.

01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:03.304
These last few days have been

01:34:03.388 --> 01:34:05.306
a good time.

01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:08.726
You know, I just...

01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:10.937
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.

01:34:12.022 --> 01:34:13.939
No problem.

01:34:14.024 --> 01:34:16.233
I know it by heart.

01:34:23.116 --> 01:34:25.659
"Home.

01:34:25.744 --> 01:34:28.746
"I have no home.

01:34:29.581 --> 01:34:31.582
"Hunted.

01:34:31.708 --> 01:34:34.084
"Despised.

01:34:34.336 --> 01:34:36.670
"Living like an animal.

01:34:36.755 --> 01:34:40.007
"The jungle is my home.

01:34:40.091 --> 01:34:42.009
"But I shall show the world

01:34:42.093 --> 01:34:45.346
"that I can be its master!

01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:49.266
"I shall perfect my own race of people.

01:34:49.351 --> 01:34:51.769
"A race of atomic supermen

01:34:51.853 --> 01:34:54.355
"that will conquer the world!"

01:34:57.942 --> 01:35:01.487
Uh, Mr. Lugosi, could I have
your autograph, please?

01:35:01.571 --> 01:35:03.864
- Certainly.
- Why, that was incredible.

01:35:03.948 --> 01:35:06.200
I mean, you're just
as great as you ever were.

01:35:06.284 --> 01:35:08.202
Better.

01:35:08.286 --> 01:35:11.372
I am 74, but I don't know it.

01:35:11.456 --> 01:35:13.415
When the brain is young

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:17.086
the spirit is still vigorous.

01:35:17.170 --> 01:35:19.963
Like a young man.

01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:24.385
"And left the planet Mars

01:35:24.469 --> 01:35:26.220
"never to return again."

01:35:27.146 --> 01:35:28.380
"The end."

01:35:33.853 --> 01:35:35.646
Wood Productions.

01:36:32.495 --> 01:36:35.873
Hey, whose crazy idea was it
to bury him in the cape?

01:36:35.957 --> 01:36:39.460
I heard it was in the will,
it was how he wanted to be remembered.

01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:17.080
Could you run it again?

01:37:29.928 --> 01:37:32.846
- Mr. Wood.
- Huh?

01:37:32.931 --> 01:37:35.849
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds,
your landlord.

01:37:35.934 --> 01:37:38.185
Could you please open up?

01:37:38.269 --> 01:37:40.270
One minute.

01:37:42.065 --> 01:37:43.148
Yes?

01:37:43.233 --> 01:37:47.402
Uh, Mr. Wood, you have bounced
your third and final rent check.

01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:50.447
I'm terribly sorry.

01:37:50.532 --> 01:37:52.866
My stockbroker must've transferred
the wrong account.

01:37:52.951 --> 01:37:54.910
Come on in.
I'll write you another check.

01:38:00.207 --> 01:38:02.167
I see you're in the picture business.

01:38:02.252 --> 01:38:06.338
- Yes.
- I'm interested in the picture business.

01:38:06.422 --> 01:38:07.839
My associates and I,

01:38:07.924 --> 01:38:10.759
we wish to produce
a series of uplifting religious films

01:38:10.843 --> 01:38:13.011
about the apostles.

01:38:13.096 --> 01:38:16.181
But unfortunately,
we don't have enough money.

01:38:16.432 --> 01:38:18.183
Well, raising money's tough.

01:38:18.268 --> 01:38:21.228
No, our church has enough money
for one film.

01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:24.231
We just don't have enough for all 12.

01:38:26.150 --> 01:38:28.485
Well, you know what you do?

01:38:28.611 --> 01:38:31.405
You produce a film in
a commercially-proven genre

01:38:31.489 --> 01:38:32.489
and then after it's a hit,

01:38:32.574 --> 01:38:34.992
you take the profits from that
and make the 12 apostles movies.

01:38:35.243 --> 01:38:37.786
- Would that work?
- Absolutely.

01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:39.830
Let me show you something.

01:38:41.666 --> 01:38:43.584
You see this script?

01:38:43.668 --> 01:38:46.003
<i>Grave Robbers From Outer Space.</i>

01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:48.422
Money in the bank.

01:38:48.506 --> 01:38:50.465
Grave robbers from what?

01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:54.428
From outer space. It's science fiction.
Very big with the kids.

01:38:54.512 --> 01:38:56.013
If you make this picture,

01:38:56.097 --> 01:38:58.432
you'll have enough money
to finance 100 religious films

01:38:58.516 --> 01:39:00.851
and pay my back rent with the profits.

01:39:00.935 --> 01:39:05.188
I don't know.
This is all a lot to absorb.

01:39:05.481 --> 01:39:07.232
It's a guaranteed blockbuster.

01:39:09.319 --> 01:39:12.779
I understand this science fiction
is very popular, but,

01:39:12.864 --> 01:39:15.949
don't the big hits always have big stars?

01:39:16.034 --> 01:39:19.995
- Well, we have a big star, Bela Lugosi.
- Bela Lugosi...

01:39:20.079 --> 01:39:21.872
Oh, I thought he passed on.

01:39:23.416 --> 01:39:26.043
Yes. Yes, he did.

01:39:26.336 --> 01:39:27.961
But...

01:39:30.715 --> 01:39:34.926
- I've got the last footage he ever shot.
- Doesn't look like very much.

01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:42.684
Mr. Reynolds, this is the acorn
that will grow a great oak.

01:39:43.728 --> 01:39:45.103
I'll just get a double to finish his scenes

01:39:45.188 --> 01:39:47.856
and we'll release it
as Bela Lugosi's final film.

01:39:48.191 --> 01:39:50.484
Bunny? We're makin' another movie.

01:39:50.568 --> 01:39:53.820
Yes, I got the Baptist Church of Beverly Hills
to put up the cash.

01:39:54.989 --> 01:39:57.532
Ed, I got the Lugosi doubles outside.

01:39:57.617 --> 01:39:59.409
Bunny, I gotta go.

01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:06.458
He's too short.

01:40:07.543 --> 01:40:09.503
He's too tall.

01:40:10.588 --> 01:40:12.381
He's just not going to work.

01:40:12.465 --> 01:40:16.677
Well, Ed, I was thinkin' like
when Bela played Fu Manchu.

01:40:16.761 --> 01:40:19.137
- Paul, that was Karloff.
- Oh.

01:40:19.222 --> 01:40:21.181
- You're gonna have to try harder.
- Okay.

01:40:21.265 --> 01:40:23.350
- Try to be a cut above. Go get 'em.
- Okay. Right.

01:40:23.434 --> 01:40:24.071
Keep Sunday open,

01:40:24.110 --> 01:40:27.021
- the producers want us to get baptized.
- Okay.

01:40:33.152 --> 01:40:37.197
You know, hon, when you rewrite a script,
it just gets better and better.

01:40:38.449 --> 01:40:42.119
This is the ultimate Ed Wood movie.
No compromises.

01:40:43.496 --> 01:40:45.288
Oh, my.

01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:47.708
- Eddie, look at this.
- Hmm?

01:40:47.792 --> 01:40:50.043
What?

01:40:50.128 --> 01:40:52.087
Poor girl's out of a job.

01:40:56.134 --> 01:41:00.554
I brought the script.
You'll be portraying the ghoul's wife.

01:41:00.638 --> 01:41:03.390
- The ghoul's wife?
- Yes.

01:41:04.474 --> 01:41:06.184
You should feel lucky.

01:41:06.269 --> 01:41:08.895
Eddie's the only fella in town
who doesn't pass judgment on people.

01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:12.482
That's right. If I did,
I wouldn't have any friends.

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:16.820
Look, would it be possible to make
the ghoul's wife a little less prominent

01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:18.280
so people wouldn't really
notice me in the movie?

01:41:18.364 --> 01:41:19.906
You don't want to be noticed?

01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:24.244
Yeah. How about this? What if I don't
have any lines? I'll play the part mute.

01:41:24.328 --> 01:41:26.788
- Mute?
- Hey, it's Dr. Tom.

01:41:26.873 --> 01:41:29.583
- Dr. Tom! Hiya!
- Who's Dr. Tom?

01:41:29.667 --> 01:41:32.753
- He's my chiropractor.
- Hey, Kathy. How are you?

01:41:32.837 --> 01:41:35.756
- Fine, thanks.
- Well, look at you.

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.758
You're looking in alignment today.

01:41:37.842 --> 01:41:40.969
Well, actually, my neck is a little funny.

01:41:41.053 --> 01:41:43.597
Now, here, let me fix that.

01:41:55.526 --> 01:41:57.194
My gosh!

01:41:58.863 --> 01:42:00.822
Don't move.

01:42:04.285 --> 01:42:06.578
It's uncanny.

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:11.041
Look at his head! It's uncanny!

01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:16.797
<i>Lift up your voice</i>

01:42:16.881 --> 01:42:19.674
<i>And let us sing</i>

01:42:19.759 --> 01:42:24.387
<i>Alleluia, alleluia</i>

01:42:26.015 --> 01:42:27.766
He look nothin' like Bela.

01:42:27.850 --> 01:42:29.935
He's kinda got his ears.

01:42:30.019 --> 01:42:32.354
Oh, look. Cover your face with this.

01:42:34.232 --> 01:42:36.149
Oh. Now I can see it.

01:42:36.234 --> 01:42:39.194
I want to suck your blood.

01:42:39.278 --> 01:42:43.448
I want to suck your blood!

01:42:43.533 --> 01:42:45.909
Let's hear you call
Boris Karloff a cocksucker.

01:42:48.663 --> 01:42:51.456
We want these Baptists
to like us. Please.

01:42:51.707 --> 01:42:54.584
<i>Alleluia</i>

01:42:54.836 --> 01:42:57.087
Brothers and sisters,

01:42:57.213 --> 01:43:01.174
we reach now in the service
a joyous point

01:43:01.259 --> 01:43:05.345
because we are going to bear witness
to the baptism of our new members.

01:43:05.429 --> 01:43:07.931
Why couldn't we do this in the church?

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:10.684
Because Brother Tor couldn't fit
in the sacred tub.

01:43:11.185 --> 01:43:13.770
Welcome to the fold, brother.

01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:18.400
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your personal savior?

01:43:18.484 --> 01:43:19.526
Yes!

01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:23.196
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

01:43:23.281 --> 01:43:24.407
Amen.

01:43:28.703 --> 01:43:31.663
Welcome to the fold, brother. Welcome.

01:43:33.958 --> 01:43:35.959
Praise the Lord, brother.

01:43:40.006 --> 01:43:42.966
Do you reject Satan and all his evils?

01:43:43.050 --> 01:43:44.968
Sure.

01:43:45.052 --> 01:43:48.430
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

01:43:54.854 --> 01:43:57.564
Praise the Lord, friends!

01:43:57.648 --> 01:44:00.609
- Do you repent for all your sins?
- I do.

01:44:00.693 --> 01:44:03.236
How do you do it? How do you get
all your friends to get baptized

01:44:03.321 --> 01:44:05.322
just so you can make a monster movie?

01:44:05.406 --> 01:44:07.073
It's not a monster movie.

01:44:07.158 --> 01:44:09.492
- It's a supernatural thriller.
- Come to Jesus, brother!

01:44:25.843 --> 01:44:28.178
I can't believe this.

01:44:43.361 --> 01:44:45.612
- Ed, what am I gonna do here?
- What do you mean?

01:44:45.696 --> 01:44:47.238
He has no hair.

01:44:47.323 --> 01:44:50.408
Gee, I never noticed that.
Put a wig on him!

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:54.537
Before we start shooting, Mr. Wood,
we have a few questions.

01:44:54.789 --> 01:44:58.375
Yes. The script contains
numerous references to grave robbing.

01:44:58.459 --> 01:45:00.335
Now, we find the concept

01:45:00.419 --> 01:45:03.046
of digging up consecrated ground
to be highly offensive.

01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:04.714
It is blasphemy.

01:45:04.799 --> 01:45:07.342
What are you talking about?
It's the premise of the movie.

01:45:07.426 --> 01:45:09.302
It's the title of the movie,
for Christ's sakes!

01:45:09.387 --> 01:45:10.804
Mr. Wood!

01:45:10.888 --> 01:45:12.806
Yes, about that title.

01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:15.225
It strikes us as very inflammatory.

01:45:15.309 --> 01:45:17.477
Why don't we change it to
<i>Plan 9 From Outer Space?</i>

01:45:20.196 --> 01:45:21.564
That's ridiculous.

01:45:24.235 --> 01:45:26.653
All right. And, action!

01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:32.492
Medical examiner been around yet?

01:45:32.576 --> 01:45:35.954
Just left. The morgue wagon
oughta be along most any time.

01:45:36.038 --> 01:45:39.541
- You get their statement?
- Yeah, but they're pretty scared.

01:45:39.625 --> 01:45:42.002
Fine mess like this
will frighten anyone.

01:45:42.086 --> 01:45:44.004
You have one of the boys

01:45:44.088 --> 01:45:47.340
take the guy and the girl back to town,
you take charge.

01:45:47.425 --> 01:45:50.343
What'd you give him all the lines for?
He's unintelligible.

01:45:50.428 --> 01:45:53.179
Lugosi's dead and Vampira won't talk,
I had to give somebody the dialogue!

01:45:53.264 --> 01:45:55.223
That is no answer!

01:45:56.851 --> 01:45:58.768
What about glitter?

01:45:58.853 --> 01:46:00.687
When I was a headliner in Paris,

01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:02.731
audiences always liked it
when I sparkled.

01:46:02.815 --> 01:46:04.774
No!

01:46:04.859 --> 01:46:06.776
- Cat's eyes!
- No!

01:46:06.861 --> 01:46:08.778
Well, I'm going to need some antennae.

01:46:08.863 --> 01:46:09.904
No!

01:46:10.072 --> 01:46:12.449
You're the ruler of the galaxy!
Show a little taste!

01:46:17.329 --> 01:46:19.539
See? No talking. Isn't he good?

01:46:19.623 --> 01:46:22.542
- Cue Dr. Tom.
- Now?

01:46:22.626 --> 01:46:24.627
Yes, now. Lurk him.

01:46:30.968 --> 01:46:33.595
Be sure and keep your face covered.

01:46:41.604 --> 01:46:44.647
Isn't it wonderful? Bela lives.

01:46:44.732 --> 01:46:47.400
Doesn't it strike you as a bit morbid?

01:46:47.485 --> 01:46:49.402
No. He would've loved it.

01:46:49.487 --> 01:46:51.571
Bela's returned from the grave.

01:46:51.655 --> 01:46:54.074
Just like Dracula. Cue Vampira.

01:47:08.762 --> 01:47:09.714
Cut!

01:47:09.799 --> 01:47:12.801
Let's go down and find out
whose grave it is.

01:47:12.885 --> 01:47:16.054
Oh, why do I always get hooked up
with these spook details?

01:47:16.305 --> 01:47:18.139
Monsters, graves, bodies!

01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:20.183
Cue flying saucer.

01:47:25.064 --> 01:47:27.190
And cut! Print. We're moving on.

01:47:28.818 --> 01:47:31.069
- That was perfect.
- Perfect? Mr. Wood,

01:47:31.153 --> 01:47:34.405
do you know anything
about the art of film production?

01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:36.407
Well, I like to think so.

01:47:36.492 --> 01:47:38.618
That cardboard headstone tipped over.

01:47:38.702 --> 01:47:41.329
This graveyard is obviously phony.

01:47:42.623 --> 01:47:44.624
Nobody will ever notice that.

01:47:44.708 --> 01:47:47.585
Filmmaking is not about the tiny details.
It's about the big picture.

01:47:47.670 --> 01:47:49.295
- The big picture?
- Yes.

01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:53.174
How about when the policemen arrived in daylight,
but now it's suddenly night?

01:47:53.259 --> 01:47:56.136
What do you know?
Haven't you heard of suspension of disbelief?

01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:58.179
Reverend, I'm here.

01:47:59.964 --> 01:48:01.141
Who is he?

01:48:01.225 --> 01:48:03.476
This is our choir director.

01:48:03.561 --> 01:48:06.020
He's gonna play the young hero.

01:48:09.066 --> 01:48:12.110
Are you people insane?
I'm the director!

01:48:12.194 --> 01:48:14.154
I make the casting decisions around here!

01:48:15.239 --> 01:48:17.157
I thought this was a group effort.

01:48:17.241 --> 01:48:19.242
No!

01:48:21.245 --> 01:48:22.745
No?

01:48:22.997 --> 01:48:25.081
They're driving me crazy!

01:48:26.584 --> 01:48:30.879
These Baptists are stupid, stupid, stupid!

01:48:33.090 --> 01:48:36.634
Okay. I gotta calm down.

01:48:36.719 --> 01:48:38.687
Gotta calm down.

01:48:40.973 --> 01:48:43.021
Gotta calm down.

01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:45.059
Take a deep breath.

01:48:45.144 --> 01:48:47.103
Relax.

01:48:52.610 --> 01:48:54.986
All right, everybody.
Let's get set up for scene 112.

01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:58.114
Move the crypt stage left,
and let's get Tor's make-up effect ready.

01:48:59.450 --> 01:49:00.825
Mr. Wood!

01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:04.329
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm directing.

01:49:04.413 --> 01:49:06.456
Not like that you're not!

01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:08.958
Remove that get-up immediately!

01:49:09.043 --> 01:49:11.044
You shame our Lord.

01:49:15.382 --> 01:49:18.259
That's it! I can't take it!

01:49:25.935 --> 01:49:28.436
Take me to the nearest bar,
and make it snappy!

01:49:38.781 --> 01:49:40.782
Imperial Whiskey.

01:50:00.177 --> 01:50:02.845
Oh, my gosh.

01:50:03.097 --> 01:50:04.847
Orson Welles.

01:50:17.027 --> 01:50:19.404
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yes?

01:50:19.488 --> 01:50:23.700
Um, well, I'm a young filmmaker
and a real big fan.

01:50:23.951 --> 01:50:26.077
I just wanted to meet you.

01:50:27.371 --> 01:50:29.580
My pleasure. I'm Orson Welles.

01:50:29.665 --> 01:50:32.333
I'm, uh, Edward D. Wood, Jr.

01:50:35.004 --> 01:50:37.213
What you working on?

01:50:37.298 --> 01:50:41.009
Well, the financing just fell through
for the third time on <i>Don Quixote.</i>

01:50:41.093 --> 01:50:43.052
You know, I can't believe it.

01:50:43.137 --> 01:50:45.305
That sounds just exactly like my problems.

01:50:45.389 --> 01:50:46.514
It's the damn money men.

01:50:46.890 --> 01:50:49.475
They never know who's a windbag
and who's got the goods.

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.477
Then they all think they're directors.

01:50:51.562 --> 01:50:52.770
Ain't that the truth?

01:50:52.855 --> 01:50:55.231
Do you know that I've even
had producers re-cut my movies?

01:50:55.316 --> 01:50:57.025
I hate when that happens.

01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:58.818
And they're always trying
to cast their buddies.

01:50:58.902 --> 01:51:00.820
It doesn't even matter
if they're right for the part.

01:51:00.904 --> 01:51:04.657
Tell me about it.
I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal

01:51:04.742 --> 01:51:07.327
but they want Charlton Heston
to play a Mexican.

01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:13.624
Mr. Welles. Is it all worth it?

01:51:13.709 --> 01:51:16.210
It is when it works.

01:51:16.295 --> 01:51:19.589
You know, the one film of mine
where I had total control, <i>Kane?</i>

01:51:19.673 --> 01:51:21.841
The studio hated it

01:51:21.925 --> 01:51:24.761
but they didn't get to touch a frame.

01:51:25.387 --> 01:51:28.598
- Ed.
- Yes?

01:51:28.682 --> 01:51:31.059
Visions are worth fighting for.

01:51:31.143 --> 01:51:34.103
Why spend your life
making someone else's dreams?

01:51:40.444 --> 01:51:43.780
Thank you, Orson.

01:51:47.785 --> 01:51:49.077
- Mr. Reynolds.
- Yes.

01:51:49.161 --> 01:51:51.871
We are gonna finish this picture
just the way I want it

01:51:51.955 --> 01:51:53.873
because you cannot compromise
an artist's vision.

01:51:53.957 --> 01:51:56.167
- But it's our money.
- And you're gonna make a bundle

01:51:56.251 --> 01:51:59.212
but only if you shut up
and let me do things my way.

01:51:59.296 --> 01:52:04.175
All right, gang. Actors in positions.
Let's finish this picture.

01:52:14.144 --> 01:52:15.269
Action.

01:52:25.239 --> 01:52:28.699
Wanna give him a hand?
Keep rolling.

01:52:46.343 --> 01:52:48.261
Now that's an alien.

01:52:49.346 --> 01:52:50.888
Action.

01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:00.690
- What plan will you follow now?
- Plan 9.

01:53:00.774 --> 01:53:03.609
Plan 9? Ah, yes.

01:53:03.694 --> 01:53:07.405
Plan 9 deals with the resurrection of the dead.

01:53:07.656 --> 01:53:11.325
Long-distance electrodes shot into
the pineal and pituitary glands

01:53:11.410 --> 01:53:13.244
of the recent dead.

01:53:13.871 --> 01:53:16.873
You know, maybe you guys were right.
"Plan 9" is a good title.

01:53:17.082 --> 01:53:19.459
I want that lightning,
I want those two explosions

01:53:19.543 --> 01:53:20.793
and I've got to have
more shots of the military!

01:53:20.878 --> 01:53:21.919
Right.

01:53:44.693 --> 01:53:46.319
And cut.

01:53:46.403 --> 01:53:49.405
All right, friends.
Prepare for scene 32.

01:53:49.490 --> 01:53:51.491
- Mr. Wood?
- Yeah?

01:53:51.575 --> 01:53:55.745
- Where's the cockpit set?
- You're standing in it. Places!

01:54:13.472 --> 01:54:15.848
But what if we develop
this solenite bomb?

01:54:15.933 --> 01:54:17.934
Then we'd be a stronger nation, too.

01:54:18.018 --> 01:54:20.186
"Stronger." You see?

01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:23.189
You see? Your stupid minds.

01:54:23.273 --> 01:54:25.191
Stupid. Stupid!

01:54:25.275 --> 01:54:27.276
- That's all I'm gonna take outta you!
- Oh!

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:32.532
Cut!

01:54:32.616 --> 01:54:34.659
Action.

01:54:41.041 --> 01:54:43.209
Greetings, my friend.

01:54:43.293 --> 01:54:45.253
We are all interested in the future

01:54:45.337 --> 01:54:50.299
for that is where you and I are going
to spend the rest of our lives.

01:54:50.384 --> 01:54:52.343
And remember, my friend,

01:54:52.427 --> 01:54:56.597
future events such as these
will affect you in the future.

01:55:14.324 --> 01:55:16.492
And cut!

01:55:17.661 --> 01:55:19.328
That's a wrap.

01:55:36.346 --> 01:55:37.513
Oh!

01:55:44.354 --> 01:55:46.272
I can't get it up. It's stuck.

01:55:46.356 --> 01:55:49.317
Eddie, you're gonna be late
for your own premiere.

01:55:49.401 --> 01:55:51.360
All right, forget it.

01:55:55.866 --> 01:55:57.867
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:55:57.951 --> 01:56:00.536
<i>you are about to see
an extraordinary motion picture.</i>

01:56:00.787 --> 01:56:04.999
<i>But before it begins,
I think we should all give a hand to the man</i>

01:56:05.083 --> 01:56:08.461
<i>without whom we wouldn't
be here tonight.</i>

01:56:08.545 --> 01:56:10.504
<i>Eddie, take a bow!</i>

01:56:49.002 --> 01:56:51.337
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:56:51.421 --> 01:56:54.632
<i>I just wanna say that this film</i>

01:56:55.717 --> 01:56:57.635
<i>is for Bela.</i>

01:57:47.602 --> 01:57:49.562
<i>The grief of his wife's death</i>

01:57:49.646 --> 01:57:52.606
<i>became greater and greater agony.</i>

01:57:54.401 --> 01:57:58.070
<i>The home they had so long shared together</i>

01:57:58.155 --> 01:58:00.281
<i>became a tomb.</i>

01:58:00.365 --> 01:58:03.826
<i>A sweet memory of her joyous living.</i>

01:58:05.370 --> 01:58:08.330
<i>The sky to which he had once looked</i>

01:58:08.415 --> 01:58:11.584
<i>was now only a covering
for her dead body.</i>

01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:23.763
<i>The ever-beautiful flowers
she had planted</i>

01:58:23.847 --> 01:58:25.765
<i>with her own hands</i>

01:58:25.849 --> 01:58:30.144
<i>became nothing more than
the lost roses of her cheeks.</i>

01:58:33.523 --> 01:58:35.691
<i>Confused by his great loss,</i>

01:58:35.776 --> 01:58:38.319
<i>the old man left that home</i>

01:58:38.403 --> 01:58:40.738
<i>never to return again.</i>

01:58:56.129 --> 01:58:58.172
This is the one.

01:58:58.256 --> 01:59:01.050
This is the one I'll be remembered for.

01:59:05.722 --> 01:59:08.641
Aw, gee, honey, I'm so happy for ya!

01:59:08.725 --> 01:59:10.893
Say, let's get married.

01:59:11.228 --> 01:59:13.687
- Huh?
- Right now. Let's go to Vegas.

01:59:13.772 --> 01:59:16.440
But, Eddie, it's pouring,
and the car top is stuck.

01:59:16.525 --> 01:59:18.275
Phooey! It's only a five-hour drive

01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:20.110
and it'll probably stop
by the time we get to the desert.

01:59:20.529 --> 01:59:24.240
Heck, it'll probably stop by the time
we get around the corner. Let's go.

01:59:26.576 --> 01:59:27.428
Oh!
