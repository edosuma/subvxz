...would you blush and giggle
or knee me in the groin?

is not where it's supposed to be.

first of all, I'm quitting that job.

- Let me tell you, man, this dude, he...
- Hey, hold on, hold on, you're quitting?

of your little screwups, Will.

what I'm trying to say to you...

18:35.920 --> 18:37.910
No, no, listen to me, okay?

18:38.090 --> 18:40.210
Look, I don't have a lot of close friends.

I wanna know why.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.060

18:48.560 --> 18:50.590
I'd rather not say.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.420
I'm sorry.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.930

Hey, Phillip.

19:01.340 --> 19:04.470
- Am I interrupting something?
- No, nothing you don't already know.

I'm just having a little discussion with Will
about this situation.

Oh, well, look, now,
let's not overreact. Okay?

No, look, as far as I'm concerned,
there's no excuse.

is in order.

Hey, lighten up.
It was only $20,000 in there.

to even be considered a bribe.

- Excuse me?
- Oh, look, look.

forget it. It's not like he delivered it.
