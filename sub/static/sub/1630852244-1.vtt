I, Shin Myung Seop,

00:31.710 --> 00:33.430
from now on forever

00:33.430 --> 00:35.390
promise to

00:35.390 --> 00:39.450
love and respect only my one and only wife, Han Sun Joo.

00:41.240 --> 00:45.640
I, Han Sun Joo, from now on forever

00:46.300 --> 00:50.820
promise to love and respect only my one and only husband,

02:30.430 --> 02:32.330
-Where's mom?
-Hmm?

02:34.340 --> 02:36.840
She was here only till now.

02:39.770 --> 02:42.870
Oh my god! What is this sound?

03:14.620 --> 03:18.290
There were like a romantic couple in the townhouse.

03:18.290 --> 03:20.450
How on earth did such a terrifying thing happen?

03:20.450 --> 03:22.150
I really can't believe this.

03:22.150 --> 03:24.570
How do I put this ...ohh

03:24.570 --> 03:28.680
from the start, I felt something was off.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.240
Someday, some big incident will happen.

03:31.240 --> 03:32.960
I got that kind of a feeling.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.980
You know, everyone has at least

03:34.980 --> 03:38.320
one secret they want to hide.

03:38.320 --> 03:42.110
Especially more when it comes to a married couple.

03:45.190 --> 03:48.770
There might be some secrets you do not want to face.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.090
Yes, Detective. I've seen all types of crimes of passion.

03:53.090 --> 03:56.390
This one case, I am unable to understand.

03:57.410 --> 03:59.540
Are you married?

03:59.540 --> 04:01.270
No, I am still single.

04:01.270 --> 04:03.360
A marriage is actually

04:03.360 --> 04:05.430
a battlefield of fierce

04:05.430 --> 04:09.260
misunderstandings and distrust rather than understanding.

04:09.260 --> 04:11.660
A battlefield...

06:13.880 --> 06:15.980
What are you debating about?

06:16.800 --> 06:19.070
This is will be nice.

06:21.920 --> 06:25.410
It is a place where all the celebrities of Korea will gather.

06:25.410 --> 06:28.580
You should stand out the most.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.620
Skills,

06:33.620 --> 06:37.410
manners and charisma.

06:41.930 --> 06:46.020
You are a man who owns everything in this world.

06:50.420 --> 06:53.360
The best out of everything that I own is

06:53.360 --> 06:55.280
you.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.930
After a long time, you can have a relaxing time.

06:58.930 --> 07:00.990
You should come along with me.

07:03.960 --> 07:08.360
I also want to go but I have no time to go dating.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.940
I need to take care of our kids.

07:10.940 --> 07:14.820
Ok. Now you should leave now.

07:14.820 --> 07:16.630
Yes.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.400
Ah.

07:28.630 --> 07:30.050
Give me a call once you arrive.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.930
Ok, I will leave now.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.470

-Sure.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.920
This is very pretty!

08:20.920 --> 08:22.200
You may take it.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.120
Thank you!

08:24.670 --> 08:26.530
Ok.

08:27.060 --> 08:29.240
Please wear it prettily.

08:34.549 --> 08:36.370
Sister Ye Rang.

08:37.210 --> 08:40.039
The bazaar started ages ago! Why are you so late?

08:40.039 --> 08:41.650
Is Ms. Sun Joo doing fine?

08:41.650 --> 08:44.010
Eun Kyung, you chose mine right?

08:44.010 --> 08:46.920
But Sun Joo is the best here.

08:46.920 --> 08:50.190
Choice? Everything was sold even before I could touch it.

08:50.190 --> 08:53.600
Even if you can't buy it you should at least take a picture.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.650
I was late.

08:56.650 --> 08:59.130
-Where is she, where?
-Over there.

09:00.030 --> 09:03.270
Thank you. Take car.

09:44.590 --> 09:46.550
-Why did you come in here?
-Why..

09:46.550 --> 09:48.200
this is fun, right?

09:48.200 --> 09:50.340
What will you do if someone sees?

09:50.340 --> 09:52.840
Then, there is more thrill.

<i>[Occupied]</i>

10:16.960 --> 10:21.100
As you already know,

10:21.100 --> 10:23.820
but I detest gambling and adventure.

10:23.820 --> 10:26.640
If the upcoming launching show fails

10:27.370 --> 10:30.420
you have to take complete responsibility.

10:32.780 --> 10:36.710
Have I ever failed, President?

10:39.620 --> 10:41.980
Why did Sun Joo not come along with you?

10:41.980 --> 10:45.330
She could have relaxed here. I had asked you to bring her, right?

10:45.330 --> 10:48.020
She is not interested in company work.

10:48.020 --> 10:50.500
You know that right, President.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.850
I am sure she is pretending to be uninterested.

10:55.170 --> 10:57.990
Now, you can leave.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.750
Yes.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.290
Who's the designer that was brought in from the outside?

11:12.290 --> 11:15.210
One of the employees from the subcontractor company Rahen dealt with.

11:15.210 --> 11:17.650
How is the designer related to Shin Myung Seop?

11:18.480 --> 11:21.240
We found no special connection.

12:17.330 --> 12:19.220
You both go inside first.

12:23.850 --> 12:25.820
Hye Rim's mother.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.080
Are you coming back from somewhere?

12:33.220 --> 12:34.950
Yes, I had some work.

12:34.950 --> 12:37.300
Who is going to pick up Hye Rim?

12:37.300 --> 12:39.240
She will come by taxi.

12:39.240 --> 12:43.390
You should have asked me if you're busy. It's a dangerous world.

12:44.710 --> 12:47.050
Did you drink?

12:49.410 --> 12:52.000
Aah, am I still not sober

12:52.000 --> 12:54.240
from drinking yesterday..?

12:55.170 --> 12:59.330
Hye Rim's mother, what is the matter these days?

12:59.330 --> 13:02.210
What is your mind on these days?

13:03.870 --> 13:07.000
What is my mind on..?

13:07.000 --> 13:11.080
Not sure. What do you think my mind is on?

13:37.810 --> 13:40.210
Check.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.920
Checkmate.

13:55.590 --> 13:58.560
I died again. As expected, I cannot win against mom.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.900
Don't give up.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.290
I am jealous of dad.

14:03.290 --> 14:04.830
I wanted to go with him.

14:04.830 --> 14:07.330
Think about your score in the last mock test.

14:07.330 --> 14:09.330
Do you still want to go and have fun?

14:09.330 --> 14:12.280
Hey, when I was in your grade...

14:14.630 --> 14:15.800
Yes, mom.

14:15.800 --> 14:19.290
Didn't I tell you to come with Shin son-in-law? Yes or No?

14:19.290 --> 14:20.390
It's alright.

14:20.390 --> 14:21.920
What do mean by "it's alright"?

14:21.920 --> 14:24.430
Tell Miss Kim to look after the kids and come here right away.

14:24.430 --> 14:27.330
I need to pick up the kids also. I can't.

14:27.330 --> 14:31.460
You can have Driver Yang pick them up, and there's also the scheduling teacher at the academy.

14:31.460 --> 14:32.650
What is wrong with you, mom?

14:32.650 --> 14:34.510
After a long time, you can watch the fashion show

14:34.510 --> 14:36.700
and also relax here. Come here.

14:36.700 --> 14:39.250
I do know why you are doing all this

14:39.250 --> 14:42.430
I'm not going to come work. Don't get your hopes up.

14:42.430 --> 14:44.610
Just because you give your everything to

14:44.610 --> 14:46.660
look after your kids and husband,

14:46.660 --> 14:48.300
do you think they'll appreciate that?

14:48.300 --> 14:51.240
They'll think that they ended up successful because they're so great.

14:51.240 --> 14:54.890
I'm not a stay-at-home mom because I want appreciation. I'm doing it because I like it.

14:54.890 --> 14:56.660
It is my choice, to live here at home.

14:56.660 --> 14:59.460
The reason I asked you to come here

15:00.500 --> 15:02.770
is not only because of that.

15:03.530 --> 15:04.570
What do you mean?

15:04.570 --> 15:08.220
Anyway, don't talk anymore and just come here.

15:35.610 --> 15:37.190
What do you think?

15:37.190 --> 15:38.570
Should we play once more?

15:38.570 --> 15:40.120
Yes, let's play one more game

15:40.120 --> 15:41.620
Ok.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.190
It feels like a dream.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.980
This is not a dream.

15:55.790 --> 15:57.890
What do I do?

15:57.890 --> 16:01.560
I keep wanting to break our promise.

16:06.080 --> 16:09.550
Keeping you for myself

16:09.550 --> 16:11.960
isn't fair to you.

16:11.960 --> 16:17.080
That's why. You are breaking up because of me and for me.

16:17.080 --> 16:22.500
Our breakup was planned anyway right.

16:25.090 --> 16:28.100
Should I just make our relationship public?

16:28.100 --> 16:30.320
Instead of breaking up?

16:34.470 --> 16:39.460
I was just kidding. Why are becoming so serious?

16:39.460 --> 16:44.030
From the start, we promised this and then started dating right.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.440
For me

16:51.440 --> 16:53.740
my family is important.

16:56.650 --> 16:58.580
I know that.

16:58.580 --> 17:01.520
We already spoke about that.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.119
There is nothing that

17:06.670 --> 17:08.960
I can do for you.

17:08.960 --> 17:12.210
There is something you can do for me.

17:18.220 --> 17:22.200
Let's date for exactly one year.

17:24.520 --> 17:27.690
Let us date.

17:27.690 --> 17:31.820
After one year, I won't hold you back.

17:40.680 --> 17:45.350
You should never abandon your family.

17:45.350 --> 17:47.420
Together with your family,

17:47.420 --> 17:51.750
you should live hundreds and thousands of years happily.

17:58.110 --> 18:01.000
I am letting you go so

18:02.000 --> 18:05.980
If you don't be happy, I think I might suffer.

18:35.480 --> 18:39.170
You are so cool, my Mi Ra!

18:40.910 --> 18:43.700
What? Your face looks sad.

18:43.700 --> 18:46.440
Should I hold on to you more?

18:49.580 --> 18:51.600
Let's toast.

18:51.600 --> 18:57.650
For our beautiful breakup trip.

18:58.540 --> 19:00.890
For our

19:00.890 --> 19:02.960
memories.

19:08.570 --> 19:12.820
Tomorrow is the brand launching show. Expect to

19:19.620 --> 19:23.530
see a gift I have prepared for you.

21:45.860 --> 21:48.440
Are you having a hard time these days?

21:48.440 --> 21:50.480
Does it look like that?

21:55.330 --> 21:59.460
Yes, I can notice right away, that something is going on with you.

22:06.070 --> 22:08.300
Poor you.

22:08.300 --> 22:11.520
What can I do for you?

22:14.730 --> 22:17.150
You just

22:17.150 --> 22:19.370
need to have fun with me.

22:22.110 --> 22:24.240
Come on!

22:26.790 --> 22:28.870
Wait.

22:34.780 --> 22:36.460
What is this?

22:36.460 --> 22:38.860
I just drew this as I was bored.

22:38.860 --> 22:40.770
Looks good though!

22:44.110 --> 22:45.960
I will gift it to you.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.780
<i>If you had been more criticizing with the jewelry,</i>

23:27.780 --> 23:29.720
<i>the group's image and worth</i>

23:29.720 --> 23:31.770
<i>would have been so much better!</i>

23:31.770 --> 23:33.710
Because of your stubborness,

23:33.710 --> 23:36.440
do you know how much we've lost?

23:39.730 --> 23:41.640
I'll make sure

23:41.640 --> 23:43.720
to find a breakthrough design.

24:04.570 --> 24:06.900
You are having a tough time, right?

24:08.020 --> 24:09.980
I am still far from finished.

24:09.980 --> 24:11.950
You should go to sleep first.

24:29.240 --> 24:31.590
This design is very nice.

24:32.670 --> 24:37.160
I like it. Seems to know how women feel.

24:39.370 --> 24:42.220
Honey, like these heels

24:42.220 --> 24:45.810
using very feminine, classic, and luxury items

24:45.810 --> 24:49.240
what do you think about launching a new brand?

25:12.460 --> 25:15.150
You are my queen.

25:15.150 --> 25:18.020
You are my lover.

25:46.640 --> 25:47.970
How was it?

25:47.970 --> 25:49.840
My gift for you?

25:50.430 --> 25:52.660
It was touching.

25:54.160 --> 25:57.340
There will be design royalties deposited into your account

25:57.340 --> 26:00.240
to match the sales of the shoes.

26:00.240 --> 26:02.050
Really?

26:02.050 --> 26:04.400
I've hit the jackpot.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.900
Can I give you a thank-you kiss?

26:09.480 --> 26:11.090
Whenever you get flustered,

26:11.090 --> 26:13.450
whenever you get flustered?

26:14.880 --> 26:17.660
I will go back first.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.170
OK.

26:19.170 --> 26:21.120
Thank you!

26:22.390 --> 26:26.890
For making my heels the queen's heels.

26:31.240 --> 26:35.170
You are always my queen.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.810
How come you are here?

27:29.810 --> 27:31.810
Surprise!

27:32.440 --> 27:33.920
You said you could not come.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.920
You were surprised, right?

27:36.560 --> 27:40.400
- When did you come? - Right before the launching show.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.320
How did you like the show?

27:43.320 --> 27:45.420
Very cool!

27:45.420 --> 27:47.600
As expected, my husband is the best.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.410
It is your idea, though!

27:50.410 --> 27:52.890
Anybody can give ideas,

27:52.890 --> 27:54.860
but making a stone

27:54.860 --> 27:58.630
into a nice diamond is harder.

27:58.630 --> 28:01.050
You are really amazing!

28:02.930 --> 28:05.120
- But, who is it? - Uh?

28:05.560 --> 28:07.790
Victoria shoes' designer?

28:07.790 --> 28:10.010
Our company's employee?

28:10.780 --> 28:12.720
Web designer.

28:14.060 --> 28:17.180
I want to meet the designer.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.890
Is there really a need to meet?

28:21.500 --> 28:25.470
What I mean is, if you are not going to join the company again

28:25.470 --> 28:27.320
it will look like you are interested in the work.

28:27.320 --> 28:30.430
Mother-in-law also has regrets about you.

28:30.430 --> 28:33.780
There is no need to give her unnecessary expectations.

28:34.360 --> 28:37.800
Yes, that's also true.

28:39.650 --> 28:41.490
Sun Joo,

28:41.490 --> 28:43.410
it's been a long time.

28:43.410 --> 28:45.010
Ruyi,

28:45.010 --> 28:48.090
Nice to meet you! How have you been?

28:48.090 --> 28:52.610
Mr. Shin, today's show was absolutely impressive.

29:01.390 --> 29:05.660
<i>This is truly a spectacular show.</i>

29:13.140 --> 29:17.190
<i>It was amazing. Those shoes were an absolute showstopper.</i>

29:20.290 --> 29:22.030
- Mom. - Uh!

29:22.600 --> 29:24.390
You came?

29:28.850 --> 29:30.260
Congratulations!

29:30.260 --> 29:33.810
Today's launching show was a grand success.

29:33.810 --> 29:37.030
Chief, you also worked hard.

29:37.660 --> 29:40.450
As expected, your business mind.

29:40.450 --> 29:42.800
It's still alive.

29:42.800 --> 29:45.590
There is not much that I did.

29:46.220 --> 29:49.290
Then, please continue your conversation.

29:51.150 --> 29:53.250
There is no need to be humble.

29:53.250 --> 29:56.680
Everybody knows that it's your work in today's show.

29:56.680 --> 29:59.380
Today, just enjoy and congratulate.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.800
It is a nice occasion.

30:28.010 --> 30:30.410
You have worked hard!

30:33.490 --> 30:35.730
Seeing you in a place other than home,

30:35.730 --> 30:37.740
it feels so different.

30:39.300 --> 30:41.200
It feels like we are dating again.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.850
Don't you think so, Shin Myung Seop?

30:44.440 --> 30:47.160
You must be very tired. You want a bath?

30:47.160 --> 30:49.140
You want me to get the bath prepared?

30:49.140 --> 30:52.520
No, I will take a simple shower.

30:53.210 --> 30:56.290
Then, do you want a glass of wine?

30:56.290 --> 30:58.770
Probably not.

30:58.770 --> 31:00.450
Sure?

31:08.180 --> 31:10.690
Honey, is something wrong?

31:10.690 --> 31:13.990
Me? No. Why?

31:14.720 --> 31:16.640
Just..

31:16.640 --> 31:19.640
you are so busy, did I disturb you by coming?

31:22.990 --> 31:25.160
Well...

31:25.160 --> 31:28.500
the buyer from Shanghai

31:28.500 --> 31:30.240
has to leave early in the morning.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.440
He wants to meet right away.

31:32.440 --> 31:34.560
Then, go immediately. Don't worry about me.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.070
Will you be alright alone?

31:37.070 --> 31:38.560
I am alright,

31:38.560 --> 31:41.930
so finish all your work slowly.

31:43.630 --> 31:46.330
Ok then, I'll go and come back soon.

31:46.330 --> 31:48.170
Take rest.

32:13.700 --> 32:15.560
What is all this?

32:21.350 --> 32:24.980
My return gift for your gift..?

32:24.980 --> 32:26.830
Did you like my gift?

32:26.830 --> 32:31.590
Yes, it was beyond my imagination. I think it turned to be better than my design.

32:38.380 --> 32:42.520
Victoria.. give it to me.

32:43.430 --> 32:45.780
Hmmm...

32:45.780 --> 32:47.520
that won't work.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.010
OK.

32:53.250 --> 32:54.900
You have the talent.

32:54.900 --> 32:58.360
Don't lose it.

33:01.430 --> 33:03.280
As expected,

33:03.280 --> 33:08.480
you are the only one that recognizes me and lets me shine.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.580
I love you.

35:03.870 --> 35:07.230
As usual, this place is still the same.

35:07.230 --> 35:10.690
Do you remember? When we came together for a trip?

35:10.690 --> 35:11.900
Of course.

35:11.900 --> 35:15.420
It was my first trip with you.

35:24.780 --> 35:27.210
If Tae Hee and Taeyong ride that, they would like it.

35:27.210 --> 35:28.740
We should bring them here next time.

35:28.740 --> 35:30.790
Yes.

35:30.790 --> 35:33.900
Ok, let's eat now.

35:46.470 --> 35:48.370
It tastes good.

35:50.980 --> 35:52.730
Here, you try too.

35:52.730 --> 35:55.620
I am alright, I am not hungry.

36:03.410 --> 36:04.570
Why?

36:04.570 --> 36:10.770
I want to eat outside with you, not hiding in a place like this.

36:15.890 --> 36:18.130
After tomorrow,

36:18.130 --> 36:22.200
we will become strangers.

36:22.940 --> 36:28.790
Even if we meet coincidentally, we would pretend to not know each other.

36:37.650 --> 36:39.920
My Queen.

36:39.920 --> 36:44.050
Uh.. my meeting just ended.

36:44.050 --> 36:45.890
I'll be there.

36:45.890 --> 36:47.460
Uhh.

36:51.570 --> 36:54.390
I might have to go now.

36:54.390 --> 36:56.420
Yes, please go.

36:56.420 --> 36:58.290
You continue eating.

37:19.140 --> 37:20.930
Oh Honey.

37:23.520 --> 37:27.360
What should we do today? Where do we go?

37:29.600 --> 37:33.430
Oh no. Today, at the hotel's meeting room,

37:33.430 --> 37:35.870
the buyer meeting has officially started.

37:35.870 --> 37:38.060
I might not be able to give you time.

37:38.060 --> 37:40.130
That's alright.

37:40.130 --> 37:43.450
It's my fault to have followed a busy person.

37:43.450 --> 37:45.730
Don't worry about me and do your work.

37:45.730 --> 37:49.330
I can have fun alone also.

37:52.910 --> 37:54.710
I am sorry honey.

37:54.710 --> 37:56.880
Work hard!

37:56.880 --> 37:58.730
I'll be back.

38:19.620 --> 38:24.610
<i>3F Elevator.</i>

38:29.170 --> 38:32.090
<i>The reason I asked you to come here..</i>

38:33.560 --> 38:35.360
is not only because of that.

38:35.360 --> 38:37.740
<i>Don't talk anymore and just come.</i>

39:14.210 --> 39:16.960
That line was, from five years ago,

41:04.460 --> 41:06.470
Here you go.

41:06.470 --> 41:08.470
Thank you!

42:47.880 --> 42:49.790
Should I take you a picture?

42:49.790 --> 42:51.380
Huhh..

42:51.380 --> 42:53.640
It looks like you are here alone...

42:53.640 --> 42:57.260
How about we take each other's photos?

42:57.260 --> 42:58.980
Should we do that?

43:03.340 --> 43:06.110
1,2..

43:07.570 --> 43:10.490
This time I will click one.

43:10.490 --> 43:14.200
Thank you.

43:18.370 --> 43:23.180
1,2,3. Here you go.

43:56.120 --> 43:57.850
We meet again!

44:04.290 --> 44:06.120
Do you know that?

44:06.900 --> 44:10.240
There is a legend about this island.

44:10.240 --> 44:13.510
A girl who came down from heaven to have fun

44:13.510 --> 44:17.610
fell in love with a human and lived here in hiding.

44:17.610 --> 44:20.180
When the Jade Emperor found out,

44:20.180 --> 44:22.370
he left the girl on this side.

44:23.650 --> 44:26.520
And the human on that side.

44:29.340 --> 44:32.020
So that they don't meet.

44:33.480 --> 44:35.500
And only look at each other.

44:36.980 --> 44:39.780
It's similar to The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.

44:40.520 --> 44:44.990
All legends are somewhat similar.

44:44.990 --> 44:47.580
It's a little trivial love story.

44:51.260 --> 44:54.040
Do you think there is trivial love?

44:55.450 --> 44:59.310
Everybody finds their love is special and precious, right?

45:05.150 --> 45:06.850
Yes, that's right.

45:08.400 --> 45:11.060
Everyone finds their love

45:12.010 --> 45:14.500
to be special and precious.

45:27.250 --> 45:28.690
Honey.

45:30.430 --> 45:34.220
Now, I am at an amazing place.

45:34.220 --> 45:36.410
I was a little sad that

45:36.410 --> 45:39.610
you were not here.

45:39.610 --> 45:43.620
I am having a good time, so don't worry and continue your work.

45:43.620 --> 45:45.290
Hmm...

45:46.160 --> 45:47.870
I love you!

45:57.720 --> 46:02.720
My side.

46:12.010 --> 46:17.120
<i>Come here, I will give you the address.</i>

46:23.550 --> 46:26.080
<i>I will give the address... come here. Come to Yeosu dock by 10. </i>

47:19.470 --> 47:22.420
<i> My Queen </i>

47:37.950 --> 47:39.390
What is the matter?

47:39.390 --> 47:42.680
Oh, we meet again!

47:43.290 --> 47:46.570
Did your car break down?

47:46.570 --> 47:50.260
It's not a breakdown, but it's run out of oil.

47:50.260 --> 47:53.830
- I should have checked.
- Have you called the car rental agency?

47:53.830 --> 47:57.830
Yes, they said they would come soon.

48:13.680 --> 48:15.730
I am Han Sun Joo,

48:15.730 --> 48:17.870
I came from Seoul.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.230
I am Yoon Mi Ra, I am also from Seoul.

48:33.720 --> 48:36.850
Do you have an appointment by any chance?

48:36.850 --> 48:39.470
Because of me...

48:39.470 --> 48:42.780
I do have a meeting...

48:42.780 --> 48:45.610
I have some time remaining, so it's alright.

48:50.110 --> 48:51.990
Hello...

48:51.990 --> 48:54.520
you said you would come soon?

48:54.520 --> 48:56.270
So, you cannot come?

48:56.270 --> 48:58.210
Then, what do I do?

48:58.210 --> 48:59.760
Will they not come?

48:59.760 --> 49:01.840
Yes, they had an accident while coming

49:01.840 --> 49:04.760
They want me to wait until they send a taxi.

49:04.760 --> 49:06.730
Are you going to Shinhye by any chance?

49:06.730 --> 49:09.190
Yes, the hotel is there.

49:09.190 --> 49:12.180
Then, I can give you a ride.

49:12.180 --> 49:14.110
Could you please do that?

49:14.110 --> 49:16.200
Oh, wait a minute.

49:16.200 --> 49:17.480
Hello,

49:17.480 --> 49:20.490
no need for a taxi, I will manage.

49:20.490 --> 49:23.230
I can just leave my car here, right?

49:24.640 --> 49:28.150
Ok, ok.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.590
Please get on.

49:31.590 --> 49:33.850
Thank you so much!

49:48.060 --> 49:51.570
<i>The call cannot be connected, so you will be...</i>

49:52.770 --> 49:54.460
Is he busy?

49:56.130 --> 49:58.540
I tagged along on my husband's business trip.

49:58.540 --> 50:03.180
My husband is busy due to meetings, and I am going alone.

50:03.180 --> 50:04.790
I see.

50:05.470 --> 50:09.130
- Mi Ra, are you here alone? - I also came with my husba...

50:10.790 --> 50:13.620
I came with my boyfriend.

50:14.300 --> 50:17.170
My boyfriend is also busy due to work.

50:17.170 --> 50:19.680
We're in the same boat.

50:23.500 --> 50:27.380
Thank you so much for today!

50:27.380 --> 50:29.410
There's nothing much that I did.

50:29.410 --> 50:33.270
Not at all. I am a person you really don't know,

50:33.270 --> 50:37.580
you were worried for me and stayed with me. And you are also giving me a ride,

50:37.580 --> 50:40.290
even though it looks easy, not everyone can do that.

50:40.290 --> 50:42.790
Please stop, you are embarrassing me.

50:43.440 --> 50:48.250
- Do you want to have dinner together? I'll treat you - No that's ok.

50:48.250 --> 50:50.630
I am hungry, that's why.

50:50.630 --> 50:51.930
Oh yeah, you told me

50:51.930 --> 50:53.950
you had a meeting.

50:55.770 --> 50:58.310
I might have to eat dinner alone.

50:58.310 --> 51:02.420
Is that so? That's good, then we should eat together.

51:02.420 --> 51:03.950
Sounds good!

51:13.070 --> 51:15.220
Isn't this too much food for two people?

51:15.220 --> 51:18.870
Today, I am drained out because of many incidents.

51:18.870 --> 51:20.740
I need to recharge.

51:21.550 --> 51:22.900
Yes.

51:22.900 --> 51:25.540
We should eat it all, without leaving anything.

51:34.280 --> 51:36.180
It's delicious.

51:51.090 --> 51:54.330
Excuse me... what's the matter?

51:56.000 --> 52:00.480
I think I left behind my wallet in the rental car.

52:02.040 --> 52:03.640
What do I do?

52:03.640 --> 52:05.390
How much is it?

52:11.740 --> 52:13.980
Could you at least give me your contact?

52:13.980 --> 52:15.510
I'll pay you back.

52:15.510 --> 52:18.020
No that's not needed, don't worry.

52:18.020 --> 52:20.710
I can't do that. It's because I feel uncomfortable.

52:20.710 --> 52:26.700
That's okay. I made good memories because of a travel mate. So it's all ok.

52:28.800 --> 52:33.540
Thank you! I will cherish this for the rest of my life.

52:33.540 --> 52:35.770
Yes, make sure to remember me.

52:35.770 --> 52:38.690
Have a good rest of the time on this trip.

52:38.690 --> 52:41.460
You too, Han Sun Joo.

53:26.530 --> 53:29.200
Honey, I am sorry I couldn't be with you....

53:29.200 --> 53:33.380
Instead, I selected a Champagne that you might like.

53:33.380 --> 53:36.920
Even if you are alone, spend a good time.

54:03.500 --> 54:05.170
Here.

54:08.280 --> 54:09.980
Open it.

54:16.350 --> 54:20.630
I chose shoes that suit you.

54:21.520 --> 54:23.290
They are sexy.

54:23.290 --> 54:25.090
Give me.

54:29.960 --> 54:34.130
Women call high heels combat boots.

54:34.130 --> 54:36.400
From now on,

54:37.950 --> 54:40.420
no matter what hardship comes your way,

54:43.210 --> 54:47.160
wear these high heels and walk on fearlessly.

54:57.470 --> 55:03.350
Everything that's going to happen from now on, I will be sure to prevail.

55:18.990 --> 55:20.250
You don't know anything.

55:20.250 --> 55:21.700
What do I not know?

55:21.700 --> 55:26.360
Do you think the love between you is the only beautiful ardent, and touching in this world?

55:26.360 --> 55:28.010
How dare you?!

55:28.010 --> 55:30.120
You think you're so great?

55:30.120 --> 55:32.350
Let go!

55:32.350 --> 55:34.110
What are you doing, it's embarrassing!

55:34.110 --> 55:38.190
If you know if it's embarrassing, why did you do something so filthy?!

55:38.190 --> 55:40.410
<i>You can die! Let go of me!</i>

55:40.410 --> 55:41.630
Let me go.

55:41.630 --> 55:43.660
Dirty wench!

55:53.100 --> 55:56.790
What the hell!

55:56.790 --> 56:00.880
It's better to leave them alone.

56:00.880 --> 56:02.390
So what is this?

56:02.390 --> 56:06.860
Hye Rim's mom was having an affair?

56:19.490 --> 56:22.380
Shouldn't we go behind Hye Rim?

56:22.380 --> 56:24.100
No need, what are you going to do?

56:24.100 --> 56:27.600
But still, we should at least comfort her...

56:27.600 --> 56:29.670
What comfort?

56:45.260 --> 56:47.290
Oh, my daughter!

56:47.290 --> 56:48.880
What are you doing?

56:48.880 --> 56:51.010
I just got home from the academy.

56:51.010 --> 56:53.650
We're eating snacks Miss Kim made for us.

56:53.650 --> 56:56.440
Mom, mom, there is big news.

56:56.440 --> 57:01.670
After a long time, mom is having a good time with dad. Do you want to ruin it?

57:01.670 --> 57:03.280
Clueless...

57:03.280 --> 57:04.490
Oh mom.

57:04.490 --> 57:07.390
What's the matter? Did something happen?

57:07.390 --> 57:09.040
No, nothing happened.

57:09.040 --> 57:11.220
Hand the phone to Taeyong.

57:13.330 --> 57:14.970
Here.

57:16.490 --> 57:17.690
Mom.

57:17.690 --> 57:19.280
Is something going on?

57:19.280 --> 57:22.190
No, just...

57:22.190 --> 57:23.750
I am missing you.

57:23.750 --> 57:27.350
Mom also is missing her son already.

57:27.350 --> 57:30.610
But, it's alright if you come a little late.

57:30.610 --> 57:34.070
Spend a good time with dad. I love you.

57:34.070 --> 57:37.580
Ok. I love you, son!

57:48.120 --> 57:52.100
Will you be able to forget me?

57:52.100 --> 57:55.770
If you ask me to forget you, I will.

57:55.770 --> 57:57.970
If you ask me not to,

57:58.850 --> 58:04.380
I will not.

58:17.240 --> 58:20.260
You are letting me go for my sake, right?

58:21.580 --> 58:27.420
As you said, I will live my life from now on.

58:27.420 --> 58:30.520
You should also live your life.

58:43.070 --> 58:45.480
I want to get drunk.

58:48.300 --> 58:50.190
Wait.

59:59.030 --> 01:00:02.450
Han Sun Joo.

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:04.150
Here you go.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.010
This is a gift for my queen from my heart.

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:11.980
Gift?

01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:28.590
Victoria, that was at the fashion show's finale?

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:34.520
One and only shoes that only you can wear.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:37.620
Thank you, Honey!

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.410
Give me.

01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:42.950
Here.

01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:46.330
This side, too.

01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:55.850
Pretty!

01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:16.040
Next time, let's come for a vacation with kids, not for work.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.320
I need to record this.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.520
Say that again, so I can record it.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.720
Let us go.

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:27.230
Careful with your head.

01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:32.540
<i>Yisu Airport</i>

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:45.680
Hello.

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:55.880
Yes, I will be there right away.

01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:04.310
You go inside alone.

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:06.250
What is the matter?

01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:08.730
Suddenly, a problem has arisen.

01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:11.530
I need to go there quickly.

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:13.150
I'll see you at home.

01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:14.790
Wait.

01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:31.230
Honey,

01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:33.280
is it something bad?

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:36.310
No, nothing bad happened. Don't worry.

01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:38.520
Go inside carefully.

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:07.340

<i> This is the hospital's emergency room, you know Yoon Mi Ra, right? </i>

01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:31.900
<i>Your number showed up on the outgoing calls, so we called.</i>

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:46.110
<i> Will you get in or not? </i>

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:49.180
Oh...

01:03:50.110 --> 01:03:54.170
<i>Miss Yoon Mi Ra took poision, so she's in the emergency room.</i>

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:05.400
Yoon Mi Ra?

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:56.610
Are you back to consciousness?

01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:58.690
Are you alright?

01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:13.100
Why did you do something so foolish?

01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:21.300
Mi Ra..

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:31.020
I didn't want to make it difficult for you.

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:35.410
That's why, I wanted to break up...

01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:40.450
It is right for us to breakup
