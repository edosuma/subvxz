WEBVTT

01:38.733 --> 01:41.702
Alex, this way!

01:42.302 --> 01:43.738
Come on!

01:55.116 --> 01:56.083
Hurry.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.159
Get in and don't come out.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.761
Daniel, I'm scared.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.005
Shh.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.473
Daniel, please.
They're trying to kill me.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.911
Please help me.
Daniel, please.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.445
He's in here.

02:25.545 --> 02:26.981
No, no, no! God, no!

02:31.451 --> 02:32.419
No, Charles! Stop!

02:32.519 --> 02:34.322
- Helene!
- No, please, stop it!

02:34.421 --> 02:36.090
No! Charles!

02:36.190 --> 02:38.893
No. No.

02:39.459 --> 02:40.828
Charles.

02:41.528 --> 02:43.097
No, please. Please, stop.

02:43.197 --> 02:46.834
Please. No. You don't have to do this.

02:48.803 --> 02:51.839
Daniel, I'm so proud of you.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.040
Please, listen to...

02:55.009 --> 02:57.444
You don't have to do this.
Nothing's gonna happen.

02:59.347 --> 03:02.582
Helene! Helene,
please just talk to them.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.085
Helene!

03:05.086 --> 03:07.722
Please, no! No! No, please!

03:07.822 --> 03:09.857
No!

03:16.264 --> 03:18.299
<i>To have and to hold.</i>

03:18.398 --> 03:20.134
<i>From this day forward.</i>

03:20.533 --> 03:22.737
For better, for worse.

03:24.404 --> 03:27.507
For richer, for poorer.

03:28.608 --> 03:30.410
In sickness, and in health.

03:32.113 --> 03:33.680
Till death do us part.

03:35.983 --> 03:41.122
And even though your family
is richer than God,

03:41.621 --> 03:43.724
intimidates
the hell out of me...

03:44.591 --> 03:46.027
your dad definitely hates me,

03:46.127 --> 03:48.796
and your alcoholic brother
keeps hitting on me...

03:57.738 --> 04:01.675
I honestly can't wait to be a part
of your moderately fucked-up family.

04:01.776 --> 04:04.378
"Moderately"?
That's pretty generous.

04:04.477 --> 04:05.645
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.149
Holy shit!

04:10.985 --> 04:12.086
You look perfect.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.121
What're you doing?

04:14.221 --> 04:16.456
You smoking? In my old room?

04:17.291 --> 04:18.726
Give me that.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.728
We should get down there.

04:22.562 --> 04:24.065
Your dad looks
like he's at a funeral.

04:24.165 --> 04:26.334
- He hates me.
- No. He doesn't hate you, Grace.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.634
He thinks
I'm after your money.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.470
Well, I mean, that's true.
Yeah.

04:30.570 --> 04:32.572
- You just gotta give it time...
- So mean!

04:32.672 --> 04:34.641
What? No, it's true.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.178
Honey, just give it time.
Okay?

04:37.644 --> 04:39.080
- Okay.
- Okay? We sprung this on them.

04:39.180 --> 04:42.717
- Yeah.
- They're used to a three-year courtship.

04:43.217 --> 04:44.617
And not what we did.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.120
The, I don't know,
18-month...

04:46.220 --> 04:47.188
Bone-a-thon.

04:47.288 --> 04:49.056
"Bone-a-thon"? Okay. Yeah.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.092
- We should put that in the vows.
- I did.

04:51.192 --> 04:52.492
- Oh, good.
- Mm-hmm.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.563
Anyway, who cares what they think?
They're horrible people.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.968
Well, I-I care what they think.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.871
Because they are the family
of the man that I love.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.773
And I want them to accept me.

05:06.207 --> 05:08.476
Are you okay? 'Cause I'm
nervous enough as it is.

05:08.575 --> 05:10.211
No, it's not that. I just...

05:10.677 --> 05:12.213
Without you, I'm...

05:12.313 --> 05:14.148
- One of us.
- Hey.

05:14.248 --> 05:16.317
- Daniel.
- I've been sent to fetch you.

05:16.417 --> 05:21.322
<i>♪ Here comes the groom
shitting his pants ♪</i>

05:21.422 --> 05:22.356
<i>♪ He cannot believe ♪</i>

05:22.456 --> 05:24.691
- <i>♪ That his entire life is over ♪</i>
- Daniel, you fuck. Stop it.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.962
I'm gonna let you go
in three, two... release.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.297
Take it easy.

05:30.965 --> 05:33.267
It's not too late to flee,
you know.

05:33.367 --> 05:34.802
You don't belong
in this family.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.669
I mean that
as a compliment.

05:40.775 --> 05:43.844
Okay. Well, if you're still
determined to be a Le Domas,

05:43.944 --> 05:46.881
then would you please
get yourselves outside. Okay?

05:47.448 --> 05:49.616
Congratulations, you fuckface.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.752
Thank you.

05:53.653 --> 05:57.024
I can't believe
that in half an hour...

05:57.825 --> 06:02.695
I will be a part of
the Le Domas gaming...

06:03.563 --> 06:04.799
dynasty? Empire?

06:04.899 --> 06:06.467
"Dominion."
We prefer "dominion."

06:06.566 --> 06:08.169
- "Dominion."
- Yeah. But...

06:08.635 --> 06:10.670
Um...

06:12.440 --> 06:13.841
You know, Daniel's right.

06:15.810 --> 06:18.879
We could just... leave.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.348
Oh, sure, yeah. "Thanks for the presents.
Go fuck yourselves."

06:21.449 --> 06:23.884
No. I'm serious, I'm serious, honey.

06:28.322 --> 06:29.990
I'm giving you an out.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.159
Right now.

06:35.830 --> 06:38.631
No, thank you.
I'm all the way in.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.309
Are you ready for this?

06:48.409 --> 06:49.676
Oh, fuck no.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.752
Smile, please.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.323
He could've
done so much better.

07:02.423 --> 07:05.359
You're just saying that
because he's your favorite.

07:05.726 --> 07:09.897
Oh, please.
I love all of you... equally.

07:11.664 --> 07:14.667
Two years
is a long time, Alex.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.138
I started to think
we'd really lost you.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.741
Smile. Smile, please.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.177
The more natural the better.

07:23.676 --> 07:25.112
Okay, that's good.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.047
Don't take it personally.

07:27.148 --> 07:30.050
They're just trying to figure out
if you're a gold-digging whore.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.086
You know, like my wife.

07:32.186 --> 07:33.454
To the left.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.687
She's pretty enough,

07:34.788 --> 07:37.158
in a "last call at
the dive bar" kinda way.

07:38.459 --> 07:39.692
But she'll never be one of us.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.762
Of course not, dear.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.831
She has a soul.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.466
Where the hell's your sister?

07:46.100 --> 07:47.667
I'm sure it's Fitch's fault.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.104
He's useless.
But he's one of us.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.339
Is Grace?

07:56.911 --> 07:58.913
There you are.

07:59.013 --> 08:00.214
Hi!

08:00.314 --> 08:01.348
Hi.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.153
- Give me a hand.
- Oh. Okay.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.626
It's a beautiful case, wow.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.461
Thank you. It was my mother's.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.197
Do you smoke?

08:16.997 --> 08:18.032
Oh, no.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.035
Nervous?

08:22.670 --> 08:23.871
Ah.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.540
Because your blood
isn't blue enough?

08:27.741 --> 08:30.110
They said
the same thing about me.

08:30.211 --> 08:31.412
They did?

08:31.512 --> 08:34.515
Stand tall and fuck 'em.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.787
The only thing that matters
is what Alex thinks.

08:40.354 --> 08:43.123
And that we know.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.601
- I love you.
- I love you.

08:53.702 --> 08:54.735
I have something?

09:29.270 --> 09:32.273
Oh, shit. Shh.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.511
Do you remember
anything that happened today?

09:37.611 --> 09:38.713
It's a goddamn blur.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.547
- But I'm pretty sure...
- Yeah.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.284
- Did we get married?
- We got married.

09:43.384 --> 09:44.585
Are you my wife?

09:44.685 --> 09:46.954
- Holy shit. Holy fucking shit.
- Yes. You're my husband!

09:47.054 --> 09:49.256
Oh, my God. Shit. Oh, babe.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.491
- Babe.
- Hey.

09:50.591 --> 09:51.558
It's hard with this thing.

09:51.659 --> 09:52.893
- I know. Listen.
- Hold me.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.128
- I have to tell you something...
- Mm-mm.

09:54.228 --> 09:55.963
Shut up.
Take your pants off.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.231
No, I have to tell you
something.

09:57.331 --> 09:59.333
- Grace, honey.
- I'm taking 'em off.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.471
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Someone's here.

10:04.571 --> 10:05.839
What?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.941
Jesus, Aunt Helene!
Can you give us a minute?

10:08.042 --> 10:10.611
You'll have to hide
better than that.

10:10.712 --> 10:12.613
We're not fucking hiding,
obviously.

10:12.714 --> 10:14.348
Everyone is waiting.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.483
Yeah, we'll be down
in a few minutes.

10:20.789 --> 10:22.956
- I'm sorry, honey.
- What the hell was that?

10:23.057 --> 10:24.325
That's my aunt Helene.

10:24.425 --> 10:27.628
She has, um...
well, she has boundary issues.

10:27.729 --> 10:28.962
Yeah.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.033
Of course
you have a secret door.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.635
It's a servant's corridor.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.705
They run
all through the house.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.175
Um, sorry, who's waiting?

10:42.910 --> 10:44.945
That's what I was trying
to tell you. Um...

10:50.050 --> 10:54.321
So, at midnight
you have to play a game.

10:55.522 --> 10:58.492
It's just something we do when
someone new joins the family.

10:59.526 --> 11:00.661
- A game?
- Yeah.

11:00.762 --> 11:02.196
What game?

11:02.296 --> 11:04.865
I don't know.
Uh, you draw a card.

11:05.566 --> 11:09.069
Could be backgammon, croquet,
checkers, for all I know.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.605
I know. I know. It's stupid.

11:11.706 --> 11:13.474
It's a little weird.

11:13.574 --> 11:15.342
Why, exactly?

11:15.442 --> 11:20.080
I guess, because we made our money in
games, it's part of the initiation.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.617
- Do I have to win?
- No. You just... you just have to play.

11:23.718 --> 11:26.220
- And then...
- And then you...

11:26.320 --> 11:28.389
you are officially
part of the family.

11:28.489 --> 11:31.358
Honestly, it means more to
them than the wedding itself.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.996
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.899
I know it's ridiculous.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.367
It's just a weird
family ritual.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.935
And we only have to
do it once. All right?

11:42.035 --> 11:44.571
Okay.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.173
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.275
If it gets your family
to accept me,

11:48.375 --> 11:53.380
I will play the shit out...
of checkers.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.851
- I'm really good at it.
- Okay.

11:56.950 --> 12:02.423
Okay. You go buy me ten minutes
'cause I gotta put on... my game face.

12:02.523 --> 12:04.958
- I see what you did there. Very good.
- Right.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.061
Okay. So, uh, I'll meet you
downstairs. Music room.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.865
Ah. Yes. A totally normal room
to have in a house.

12:10.964 --> 12:14.368
Just... It is just downstairs.
It's your second door on the right.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.570
Okay.

12:34.722 --> 12:37.090
<i>I thought
I might find you here.</i>

12:41.930 --> 12:45.132
I'm sure Mr. Le Bail
is with us today.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.838
<i>So, how much
have you told her?</i>

12:49.938 --> 12:52.874
<i>Nothing.
And I never will.</i>

12:52.973 --> 12:54.475
<i>Tomorrow we're gone.</i>

12:55.743 --> 12:57.144
<i>If she pulls that card,</i>

12:57.244 --> 13:00.080
<i>are you prepared
to do what's necessary?</i>

13:11.759 --> 13:14.796
Excuse me, whatever you wanna
say, get on with it please.

13:14.896 --> 13:18.733
You better hurry your ass
up and get here before midnight.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.402
Call me when
you get this message.

13:25.807 --> 13:27.608
Dora, two more, please.

13:29.911 --> 13:32.513
- Grace, darling.
- Hi.

13:32.613 --> 13:35.649
- Your vows were beautiful.
- Oh. Thank you.

13:35.750 --> 13:39.286
Alex didn't tell us you were
brought up in foster homes.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.656
Not that he tells us anything
these days. Champagne?

13:42.757 --> 13:44.057
Oh. Thank you. Thanks.

13:44.558 --> 13:46.493
My foster parents
were great people.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.029
And, you know,
they did what they could.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.798
But it was always temporary.

13:51.398 --> 13:54.234
I always sort of dreamed
of having a... a family.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.471
I mean, I'm sure Alex would've
loved living in sin forever.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.007
I don't doubt it.

13:59.373 --> 14:05.145
But he, um, he really understood
how important it was for me to...

14:06.714 --> 14:12.352
finally have a real,
permanent family.

14:13.387 --> 14:15.422
And I just don't
wanna let you down.

14:15.522 --> 14:19.092
Grace. When I first saw you,
I said to Tony:

14:19.526 --> 14:23.096
"Finally. One of our children
has brought home a good one."

14:23.597 --> 14:28.468
And you don't know how grateful we
are that you brought Alex back to us.

14:29.704 --> 14:32.139
But please...

14:33.206 --> 14:35.642
try to bring him back
into the fold.

14:37.712 --> 14:39.246
We're his family.

14:39.680 --> 14:40.715
I promise.

14:43.017 --> 14:44.284
Oh, sweetheart.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.653
I knew you would.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.626
Oh!

14:52.727 --> 14:53.728
- Hey.
- Hi!

14:53.828 --> 14:55.596
Mom, I'm just gonna
steal her away. Okay?

14:55.696 --> 14:56.798
Mmm.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.532
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.768
What'd she say to you?

15:00.868 --> 15:02.135
Oh, she's so sweet.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.503
Did she say anything?

15:03.604 --> 15:04.671
No. No.

15:04.772 --> 15:05.807
All right.

15:07.976 --> 15:10.044
Are you okay?
Did something happen?

15:10.143 --> 15:11.378
Yeah, no.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.113
I just,
I don't feel very well.

15:13.213 --> 15:16.183
Well, if you wanna lie down,
can't we just play the game tomorrow?

15:16.283 --> 15:17.719
- No, no, it has to be tonight.
- Hands up!

15:17.819 --> 15:21.154
- Kill, kill, kill! Kill, kill, kill!
- No! No!

15:21.254 --> 15:23.323
- Hey!
- Get him, Georgie!

15:23.423 --> 15:25.192
Whoo!
We made it, Daddy.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.728
Take it off, now!

15:26.828 --> 15:29.731
- Daddy?
- You just keep on playing there, buddy.

15:30.564 --> 15:32.100
Oh, you're so tense.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.300
- Le Bail's gonna get you.
- Asshole.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.869
- Kill, kill!
- Mr. Le Bail!

15:34.969 --> 15:37.237
You. Lady in white.

15:38.006 --> 15:40.008
Look at this, you must be the bride.

15:40.108 --> 15:41.642
- Hi.
- Fitch Bradley.

15:41.743 --> 15:42.710
Grace.

15:42.810 --> 15:43.778
Pleasure.

15:43.878 --> 15:45.612
- Alex.
- Hi, Fitch. How are you?

15:45.713 --> 15:48.016
Well done.
Sorry we cut it so close.

15:48.116 --> 15:51.151
We couldn't get our regular charter
out of de Gaulle this morning.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.154
And I cannot fly
commercial anymore, right?

15:54.254 --> 15:56.090
- It's the worst. You understand.
- Grace!

15:56.189 --> 15:57.190
Hi!

15:57.290 --> 15:58.358
- Hi!
- I'm Emilie.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.260
Oh, my God,
your dress is amazing!

16:00.360 --> 16:01.929
I've been totally
stalking you on Instagram.

16:02.030 --> 16:03.765
Oh, really? That's...

16:06.701 --> 16:08.770
We're gonna be best friends.

16:08.870 --> 16:10.404
Hi. Nice to see you.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.940
I'm so excited to be
a part of your family.

16:13.041 --> 16:14.408
Me too, me too!

16:14.508 --> 16:17.411
He will decide that, my dear.

16:17.511 --> 16:20.014
Aunt Helene.
It's nice to see you.

16:20.114 --> 16:22.050
Brown-haired niece.

16:22.150 --> 16:24.317
You continue to exist.

16:25.452 --> 16:29.623
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is 11:55.

16:36.030 --> 16:37.932
This is gonna blow your mind.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.834
Oh, okay.

16:42.536 --> 16:46.506
So this room is reserved
for family members only.

16:51.012 --> 16:52.646
After you, my dear.

16:59.020 --> 17:00.253
Holy shit.

17:09.830 --> 17:12.432
Great-Grandfather
enjoyed his games.

17:33.653 --> 17:34.688
Grace.

17:38.726 --> 17:39.927
Have a seat.

17:44.031 --> 17:45.432
Do you like to play games?

17:45.867 --> 17:49.971
Um, I guess it depends on
what we're playing.

17:50.071 --> 17:52.305
Well, we'll know in a moment.

17:53.174 --> 17:57.377
I gather you've noticed our
family is big on tradition.

17:58.345 --> 18:04.919
And now, well, now the time has come
for you to join us in those traditions.

18:05.019 --> 18:06.486
Ooh. Story time.

18:07.155 --> 18:09.356
As you may know,
my great-grandfather, Victor,

18:09.456 --> 18:13.161
set up a modest printing shop
during the Civil War,

18:13.261 --> 18:14.762
manufacturing playing cards.

18:14.862 --> 18:16.164
A generation later,

18:16.264 --> 18:20.400
my grandfather expanded into
sporting goods and board games.

18:20.500 --> 18:25.873
Under my leadership, Le Domas Family Games
acquired four professional sports teams

18:25.973 --> 18:29.476
and reached,
well, even greater heights.

18:30.144 --> 18:32.213
Some may call it luck,

18:32.312 --> 18:35.049
but, well,
it's a little more than that.

18:35.950 --> 18:39.887
You know, it's almost as if
someone's watching over us.

18:39.987 --> 18:42.890
It all began with
a very generous benefactor.

18:42.990 --> 18:45.492
And this box.

18:46.727 --> 18:50.832
You see, originally,
Great-Grandfather was a merchant seaman.

18:50.932 --> 18:52.166
It was a hard life.

18:52.266 --> 18:54.668
And, like so many,
he wanted more.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.537
On one of his
many excursions abroad,

18:57.637 --> 19:00.842
Great-Grandfather
came to meet a Mr. Le Bail.

19:00.942 --> 19:03.443
He was a... He was
a passenger aboard the ship.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.146
A collector, of sorts.

19:05.246 --> 19:08.749
Purchasing exotic antiquities
to resell to wealthy Americans.

19:08.850 --> 19:12.854
After discovering a mutual
passion for games of chance,

19:12.954 --> 19:15.689
they passed a great many hours
playing cards.

19:15.790 --> 19:20.261
And among Mr. Le Bail's
possessions was...

19:20.360 --> 19:22.529
that box.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.999
And one evening,
after indulging in more than

19:25.099 --> 19:26.600
their fair ration of rum...

19:26.701 --> 19:29.136
Mr. Le Bail
proposed a wager.

19:29.669 --> 19:33.941
If Great-Grandfather could
solve the mystery of the box

19:34.041 --> 19:35.675
before arriving at port,

19:35.776 --> 19:39.479
Mr. Le Bail would finance any
endeavor of Grandfather's choosing.

19:40.114 --> 19:41.148
Well...

19:42.216 --> 19:47.154
Great-Grandfather whiled away the
long hours at sea studying the box.

19:47.255 --> 19:48.222
Until finally...

19:54.328 --> 19:55.528
And since that time...

19:56.429 --> 20:01.969
whenever the Le Domases are presented
with a new addition to the family...

20:03.536 --> 20:07.775
we place a blank
playing card into the box.

20:08.876 --> 20:14.481
Our initiate then has the
privilege of drawing the card,

20:14.581 --> 20:19.153
and Mr. Le Bail will tell us
which game to play.

20:21.188 --> 20:22.156
I got chess.

20:22.256 --> 20:23.556
I got Old Maid.

20:24.058 --> 20:25.993
Seriously,
what the fuck is Old Maid?

20:26.093 --> 20:27.194
Fitch...

20:35.169 --> 20:37.838
So I just take out the card?

20:39.639 --> 20:42.777
My dear, it is your turn.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.325
What does it say, girl?

20:57.425 --> 20:59.193
Oh. It says...

20:59.293 --> 21:00.627
It says, "hide and seek."

21:00.728 --> 21:02.462
Are we really gonna play that?

21:10.271 --> 21:11.973
Everything okay?

21:13.140 --> 21:14.175
Uh...

21:14.275 --> 21:17.178
Yeah. Yeah.
Those are the rules.

21:18.813 --> 21:20.513
Hide and seek, right, Dad?

21:22.316 --> 21:23.851
Yes, indeed.

21:25.119 --> 21:26.320
Those are the rules.

21:27.221 --> 21:31.258
Okay, so, uh, who...
who hides and who seeks?

21:31.359 --> 21:34.895
Well, it's your initiation,
my dear.

21:34.996 --> 21:37.664
You get to be the one
to, uh, to hide.

21:38.399 --> 21:39.333
Of course.

21:41.268 --> 21:43.838
This is gonna be fun, honey.
Yeah, just come meet me in my room, okay?

21:43.938 --> 21:46.407
- No, I wanna play for real. This is so weird.
- No, no. I know.

21:46.506 --> 21:49.944
Um, so, to Mister... Le Bail.

21:52.446 --> 21:53.414
To Mr. Le Bail.

21:53.513 --> 21:56.050
- To Mr. Le Bail.
- To Mr. Le Bail.

21:58.419 --> 22:00.354
<i>The rules are simple.</i>

22:00.488 --> 22:03.057
You can hide
anywhere inside the house.

22:03.424 --> 22:08.561
We then count to 100 and
try to, um... well, find you.

22:08.863 --> 22:11.698
Well, don't you think you have
a little bit of an advantage?

22:12.233 --> 22:14.702
Oh. No, no.
We never use the cameras.

22:14.802 --> 22:18.806
<i>We always play the games as they would've
been played in Great-Grandfather's time.</i>

22:18.906 --> 22:19.740
<i>Always.</i>

22:20.041 --> 22:22.675
So, there's no way
for me to win, right?

22:22.777 --> 22:26.914
Well, you could, I mean,
stay hidden till dawn.

22:29.383 --> 22:30.751
- No, thank you.
- No.

22:30.851 --> 22:33.287
<i>We're gonna start the count</i>

22:33.387 --> 22:35.189
just as soon
as you leave, okay?

22:35.289 --> 22:36.424
Okay.

22:36.524 --> 22:38.993
Grace, good luck.

22:58.913 --> 23:01.282
<i>Who wants to play a game?</i>

Watch the door.

25:18.619 --> 25:20.087
Thank you, Charity.

25:20.921 --> 25:24.959
So, how was your
wedding night, Grace?

25:25.659 --> 25:27.027
Oh.

25:27.995 --> 25:31.732
It was just great.
Just great. I, uh...

25:33.434 --> 25:34.868
I sat in a dumbwaiter.

26:15.776 --> 26:19.313
Alex, honey,
do you want some company?

26:23.951 --> 26:25.452
Oh, fuck me.

26:36.563 --> 26:38.299
How long is this gonna take?

26:39.300 --> 26:41.035
How long
does this usually take?

26:41.135 --> 26:43.203
There is nothing usual
about this.

26:43.304 --> 26:46.140
It's only happened once
since I joined the family.

26:49.143 --> 26:51.478
Am I really supposed to know
how to use this thing?

26:55.516 --> 26:56.617
Oh, you know what?

26:56.718 --> 26:57.951
I'm just gonna
make a quick pit stop.

26:58.052 --> 26:59.586
I've got a nervous stomach.

27:01.021 --> 27:03.357
You know I've never
liked you, right?

27:04.391 --> 27:06.994
Uh...

27:12.734 --> 27:13.768
All right.

27:14.168 --> 27:15.569
That's enough of this.

27:34.154 --> 27:36.557
Shit.

27:40.527 --> 27:42.196
Shit.

27:53.874 --> 27:55.109
Oh, shit.

27:56.510 --> 27:57.945
Georgie.

28:03.752 --> 28:05.085
Georgie.

28:16.997 --> 28:18.999
Shh.

28:19.801 --> 28:21.001
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Jesus.

28:21.101 --> 28:22.636
- I nearly pissed myself.
- I know.

28:22.737 --> 28:24.538
- You need to listen to me very carefully.
- Georgie.

28:24.638 --> 28:28.008
- Shit. Come with me.
- Wait. What are we doing?

28:29.643 --> 28:32.781
- Get down. Grab your dress, grab your dress.
- Okay. Jesus.

28:35.315 --> 28:38.552
Georgie,
I know you're in here.

28:59.673 --> 29:00.875
Georg...

29:02.643 --> 29:04.411
Over here!
Over here, over here!

29:04.779 --> 29:07.014
Guys, I found her!

29:08.415 --> 29:10.551
I did it!

29:10.651 --> 29:13.721
Dad! Daddy, I did it! Look!

29:14.154 --> 29:15.522
Daddy, come see what I mean...

29:15.622 --> 29:17.991
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

29:19.828 --> 29:23.397
Oh, Jesus Christ.

29:24.131 --> 29:25.566
This is Clara.

29:25.666 --> 29:27.067
Does she look
like she's wearing

29:27.167 --> 29:29.269
a giant, white
wedding dress, Emilie?

29:29.369 --> 29:31.305
Why did you shoot her in the
face, sweetheart?

29:31.405 --> 29:33.875
You're supposed to maim her.
She needs to be alive for the ritual.

29:33.974 --> 29:34.943
I don't know.

29:35.042 --> 29:36.510
- I heard a shot.
- Yeah.

29:37.478 --> 29:38.345
Oh.

29:38.445 --> 29:40.080
Well, if she dies,
does this count?

29:40.180 --> 29:43.484
Of course it does not count.
It must be the bride.

29:43.885 --> 29:45.219
Well, what do we do now?

29:45.319 --> 29:47.020
Well, I don't know.
I'm... I'm thinking.

29:47.120 --> 29:50.090
Clara, hey.

29:50.524 --> 29:52.927
It's gonna be okay.

29:54.228 --> 29:56.798
Oh, Daniel, could you?

29:56.898 --> 29:57.932
Come on, let's take a walk.

29:58.031 --> 29:59.633
She's gonna die, guys.

30:00.133 --> 30:01.535
Walk it off.

30:04.137 --> 30:07.174
So, what do we do with her?

30:07.274 --> 30:09.643
Move her.
We don't want Grace to see.

30:09.744 --> 30:11.345
Give me the fucking lanterns.

30:12.279 --> 30:13.848
Okay. Call it.

30:15.148 --> 30:16.885
- Heads.
- Heads it is.

30:16.985 --> 30:18.887
- You get the legs.
- Okay.

30:18.987 --> 30:20.722
Hold on.

30:22.055 --> 30:25.092
It's slipping. Yeah, good.
Oh, good. Okay. Go.

30:26.260 --> 30:28.195
She was my favorite.

30:29.229 --> 30:30.631
Wait here. Don't move.

30:37.104 --> 30:40.641
Okay, sweetie, you gotta get up.
We gotta get you out of here right now.

30:40.742 --> 30:42.042
Okay. Stand up, here we go.

30:42.142 --> 30:44.812
Okay. Okay, grab...
grab your phone. Grab the keys.

30:45.546 --> 30:47.381
Fuck. Shit.

30:47.481 --> 30:49.550
Okay. Stevens must've
taken the phone, so...

30:49.650 --> 30:52.020
- Alex, what the fuck?
- You're gonna have to run, okay?

30:52.119 --> 30:54.756
Hide and seek.
You pulled the one bad card.

30:55.823 --> 30:59.493
They think... They think they
have to kill you before sunrise.

31:00.028 --> 31:01.595
- What the fuck?
- Follow me.

31:04.131 --> 31:04.966
One sec!

31:05.065 --> 31:06.533
I forgot my gun.

31:08.870 --> 31:10.137
Okay.

31:10.237 --> 31:12.040
Okay, girl, no more fuckups.

31:12.139 --> 31:14.842
- You're a winner.
- You got that?

31:23.918 --> 31:25.185
- Okay, you have your shoes?
- Alex.

31:25.285 --> 31:26.553
Honey, I need you
to put on your shoes.

31:26.653 --> 31:28.655
No, Alex, Alex,
what the fuck is going on?

31:28.756 --> 31:30.624
I need you to put
your shoes on. Right now.

31:30.725 --> 31:33.761
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

31:43.503 --> 31:44.538
Okay.

31:45.372 --> 31:48.208
They think that
if they don't kill you,

31:48.308 --> 31:50.510
something very bad
will happen to the family.

31:50.611 --> 31:54.882
Now... I had to play along
so that I can get you out.

31:54.983 --> 31:58.585
But the house is on lock down right
now, so it's gonna be really tricky.

31:58.685 --> 32:01.856
You knew what would happen
if I pulled that card.

32:01.956 --> 32:03.825
- I didn't think they'd actually go through with it.
- Fucking knew!

32:03.925 --> 32:05.860
No one ever pulls that.
It never fucking happens.

32:05.960 --> 32:07.996
- Yeah, but you knew about it!
- No, no, I didn't.

32:12.165 --> 32:14.836
- <i>I'm Richard Babis.</i>
- <i>And I'm Charlie.</i>

32:14.936 --> 32:16.303
<i>And today's segment is called</i>

32:16.403 --> 32:18.438
<i>"Getting to know
your crossbow."</i>

32:19.640 --> 32:22.242
Oh, fuck. I really...
I thought it was safe.

32:26.380 --> 32:28.615
But if I didn't
pull a card at all, then...

32:28.716 --> 32:30.885
Then your crazy family
wouldn't be trying to...

32:30.985 --> 32:33.520
- Oh, my God, they're gonna kill me.
- No, then we'd both be dead.

32:35.757 --> 32:38.258
When you marry into this
family you have to play a game.

32:38.358 --> 32:40.028
And if you don't, you die.

32:40.128 --> 32:43.163
I know that sounds crazy,
but you have to believe me, it is real.

32:44.098 --> 32:45.666
It happened to my great-uncle.

32:45.767 --> 32:48.535
He got married, he didn't play a
game, next morning he died.

32:48.635 --> 32:50.805
His wife too. Same thing
happened to my cousin Rachel.

32:50.905 --> 32:54.408
Same thing happened to a bunch of people
that I never even met before. You just...

32:56.711 --> 32:57.879
You have to play.

32:59.747 --> 33:03.550
You said your family
was... fucked-up,

33:03.650 --> 33:06.253
- but you didn't say psycho killers.
- I know.

33:06.353 --> 33:12.259
- You... you brought me here, you didn't warn me.
- You wanted to get married.

33:12.359 --> 33:14.162
- So it's my fucking fault?
- No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

33:14.261 --> 33:16.229
- Are you fucking serious?
- Shh.

33:16.329 --> 33:17.698
- We could've eloped.
- I know.

33:17.799 --> 33:19.801
- We could've...
- No, no. There are rules.

33:19.901 --> 33:21.069
You can't just elope.

33:21.169 --> 33:22.302
You... you have to have
the wedding here,

33:22.402 --> 33:24.972
and you have to play
the fucking game.

33:26.941 --> 33:30.377
You didn't even fucking talk to me.
You could've told me. We could've...

33:31.578 --> 33:33.915
- Just...
- If I told you, you would've left.

33:42.255 --> 33:44.624
And if I didn't propose,
you would've left.

33:47.128 --> 33:49.063
You're everything to me,
and I promise you

33:49.163 --> 33:51.231
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

33:51.331 --> 33:53.935
All right?
So just listen to me.

33:54.035 --> 33:55.635
You just need to go

33:55.737 --> 33:57.105
straight down this hallway until
you get to the service kitchen.

33:57.205 --> 33:58.740
I'm gonna go down
to the security room.

33:58.840 --> 34:01.441
I'm gonna unlock all the doors.
I'm gonna unlock all the doors.

34:01.541 --> 34:02.844
- No. Don't fucking leave me.
- Then you just fucking run.

34:02.944 --> 34:04.946
I have to. Honey, I have to.

34:05.545 --> 34:07.882
Just... just stay inside the
walls until you get to the kit...

34:07.982 --> 34:10.752
Hey. Hey. You can do this.
Where you going?

34:11.753 --> 34:13.587
Straight
and then, um, kitchen.

34:13.687 --> 34:15.723
To the kitchen.
Good. Good. Hey. Hey.

34:16.289 --> 34:17.859
You're gonna make it.
It's gonna be okay.

34:18.192 --> 34:19.860
- I love you.
- I love you.

34:21.763 --> 34:22.596
Go. Go.

34:25.900 --> 34:26.801
Okay.

34:26.900 --> 34:27.802
Fuck.

34:31.739 --> 34:32.907
Okay.

35:37.038 --> 35:38.105
Fuck.

35:41.474 --> 35:42.910
Oh, hey. Any sign of her?

35:43.010 --> 35:44.946
No. She could be anywhere.

35:51.919 --> 35:53.353
Found her.

36:00.094 --> 36:01.796
Jesus! Fuck!

36:01.896 --> 36:02.864
Goddammit!

36:02.964 --> 36:07.068
Emilie, aim for
the center of gravity!

36:07.168 --> 36:08.368
I don't know what I'm doing!

36:28.588 --> 36:30.892
Help, help, help, help.

36:30.992 --> 36:32.059
Fuck.

36:38.866 --> 36:40.667
Shh.

36:54.481 --> 36:56.050
I just came to get a drink.

37:07.694 --> 37:09.096
I have to call the others.

37:11.165 --> 37:12.499
No, you don't.

37:13.134 --> 37:14.101
No.

37:14.201 --> 37:16.003
You can help me. Please.

37:17.504 --> 37:19.606
This doesn't end well for you.

37:20.775 --> 37:23.110
I just don't wanna be
the one to serve you up.

37:23.778 --> 37:26.914
Daniel, I'm begging you.

37:30.918 --> 37:32.887
I'm really sorry
about all this.

37:32.987 --> 37:36.157
It's true what they say:
The rich really are different.

37:39.060 --> 37:41.228
I'll give you
a ten-second head start.

37:43.230 --> 37:44.464
Daniel.

37:57.278 --> 37:58.611
One, one thousand.

38:00.448 --> 38:01.949
Two, one thousand.

38:03.851 --> 38:05.853
<i>Two and a half, one thousand.</i>

38:11.359 --> 38:13.593
She's in the study!

38:14.795 --> 38:16.629
<i>Point
the weapon away from you.</i>

38:27.074 --> 38:28.175
You lost her?

38:29.542 --> 38:30.878
Indeed.

38:31.312 --> 38:32.747
You're pathetic.

38:33.546 --> 38:34.849
Indeed.

38:36.784 --> 38:38.953
Could you at least
pretend to care?

38:39.053 --> 38:44.058
Oh, I'm sure you'll find her and
kill her with or without my help.

38:44.657 --> 38:47.928
You know, something did
occur to me, though.

38:48.029 --> 38:51.132
Alex may have been wrong
to keep Grace in the dark...

38:51.999 --> 38:54.135
but do you remember
how you reacted

38:54.235 --> 38:55.936
when I told you about this?

38:56.203 --> 38:57.705
You didn't fucking blink.

38:58.305 --> 39:02.243
I mean, you couldn't wait
to sign your soul away.

39:04.945 --> 39:07.547
You know where I came from

39:07.647 --> 39:09.750
and what my life
was like before.

39:10.751 --> 39:13.354
I'd rather be dead
than lose all of this.

39:13.454 --> 39:16.257
Well... from your lips.

39:25.232 --> 39:27.768
- Where is she?
- I'm afraid you just missed her.

39:27.868 --> 39:30.871
Tony, Alex got out.
I'm so sorry.

39:30.971 --> 39:31.906
Goddammit.

39:32.006 --> 39:33.974
Who's the fuckup now, right?

39:35.276 --> 39:36.544
Still me?

39:36.944 --> 39:38.512
Did you find her? Is it over?

39:38.611 --> 39:39.980
No, it's not over.

39:40.081 --> 39:41.749
And now she knows
what's going on.

39:41.849 --> 39:43.851
Oh, but Emilie shot Clara
in the face.

39:43.951 --> 39:46.087
So she's dead.
That's just a side note.

39:46.187 --> 39:47.354
Clara's dead?

39:48.389 --> 39:49.689
She was my favorite.

39:50.224 --> 39:52.026
Cock! I forgot my gun.

39:52.393 --> 39:54.528
Daddy, I forgot my gun.
I suck.

39:54.627 --> 39:56.230
- Oh, it's okay.
- I suck!

39:56.330 --> 39:57.465
You don't suck, sweetheart.

39:57.565 --> 39:59.599
Here, hon, why don't you
just use mine.

40:01.202 --> 40:04.872
Mr. Le Domas, Mr. Le Domas,
I just saw her running...

40:06.974 --> 40:08.742
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

40:10.878 --> 40:13.848
- Okay, now...
- Why does this always happen to me?

40:13.948 --> 40:15.483
- Come on!
- Okay. Calm down.

40:15.583 --> 40:16.851
Baby.

40:17.952 --> 40:20.653
- Yeah, okay, that's okay, honey. Come on.
- Don't be mad.

40:20.754 --> 40:24.158
Let's go take a walk, find you an
edible, even you out a little bit.

40:24.558 --> 40:28.829
Maybe we'll find the other one that's
still alive to clean that shit up.

40:29.662 --> 40:31.065
So, wait.

40:31.732 --> 40:33.200
Does the help count?

40:33.300 --> 40:34.435
No!

40:34.535 --> 40:36.669
Why does everyone
keep asking that?

40:37.104 --> 40:39.306
We must...

40:46.747 --> 40:49.649
We must...

40:55.022 --> 40:57.358
Oh, what the fuck!

40:59.527 --> 41:02.630
We must kill the bride
by dawn.

41:02.730 --> 41:04.765
We're fucked.
I mean, we are so fucked.

41:04.865 --> 41:06.901
Calm down. Work the problem.

41:07.001 --> 41:09.870
We should use
the security cameras.

41:09.970 --> 41:11.772
You have no respect
for tradition.

41:11.872 --> 41:12.940
No, she's right.

41:13.040 --> 41:14.441
Don't you think
Great-Grandfather

41:14.542 --> 41:16.277
would've used the security
cameras if he had them?

41:16.377 --> 41:18.279
I mean, it's not tradition that
he was born before cameras.

41:18.379 --> 41:19.580
That's... that's stupid.

41:19.679 --> 41:20.680
Exactly.

41:20.781 --> 41:22.383
Times change.

41:22.483 --> 41:25.486
Speaking of which, may I please
use a weapon made this century?

41:25.819 --> 41:27.488
- I have a gun in my purse.
- You do?

41:27.588 --> 41:30.157
No. No. We use Great-Grandfather's.
That's tradition.

41:30.257 --> 41:32.026
You pick and choose.
Pick and choose.

41:32.126 --> 41:34.595
At least you're not making us
wear those fucking masks.

41:34.694 --> 41:36.864
Oh, no. That was Dad's idea.

41:37.331 --> 41:38.499
It was the '80s.

41:39.166 --> 41:43.170
- Our reverence must not wane.
- Goddammit, Sis!

41:43.270 --> 41:47.908
If we don't find her and perform the
ritual before dawn, we're all dead.

41:48.008 --> 41:51.145
Tony,
take Daniel and turn on the cameras.

41:51.245 --> 41:53.981
Everyone else fan out,
and somebody find Alex.

42:32.086 --> 42:33.754
Jesus.

42:38.993 --> 42:40.861
Fucking shit. Fuck.

42:52.239 --> 42:53.274
Come on, Alex.

43:09.556 --> 43:10.824
Monitors. Monitors.

43:44.793 --> 43:45.826
Okay.

43:45.926 --> 43:47.528
Oh, shit.

43:47.628 --> 43:49.129
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

43:57.204 --> 43:59.774
Your aunt always
gets lost in the details.

43:59.873 --> 44:01.608
Who gives a shit
how we find her?

44:01.710 --> 44:03.410
Oh. I agree completely.

44:03.510 --> 44:04.678
Yeah.

44:04.779 --> 44:06.880
- Looks like we're not the only ones.
- What?

44:06.980 --> 44:09.049
Someone turned on the cameras.

44:09.818 --> 44:10.851
Alex.

44:10.951 --> 44:14.121
Open doors.
Open fucking doors.

45:57.892 --> 45:59.126
Oh, fuck.

46:08.469 --> 46:10.003
Move.

46:14.007 --> 46:15.476
I'm afraid I can't do that.

46:23.718 --> 46:25.753
The ammunition
is display only.

46:26.888 --> 46:29.690
Now, did you really think
I would be stupid enough to...

46:30.859 --> 46:31.759
Fuck yeah!

46:36.997 --> 46:38.733
Open the door, Alex!

46:38.833 --> 46:40.501
She's in here!

46:41.703 --> 46:44.638
Open the goddamn door!

46:49.610 --> 46:51.545
Goddammit, Alex!

46:53.146 --> 46:54.615
Open this door!

46:57.351 --> 46:58.786
No, no. Hey, no!

46:58.887 --> 47:01.321
If you're not gonna help
us, get the hell out.

47:03.423 --> 47:05.058
You fucking leave her alone!

47:05.158 --> 47:06.660
You understand me?

47:06.761 --> 47:08.629
- Alex!
- That's my wife!

47:08.730 --> 47:10.264
Hey.

47:10.732 --> 47:11.766
Alex.

47:12.834 --> 47:14.736
Alex,
you don't have to do this.

47:14.836 --> 47:16.069
Alex.

47:17.972 --> 47:20.240
Okay.

47:20.641 --> 47:22.109
Oh, God. Oh, God.

47:27.015 --> 47:28.282
I know, I know.

47:28.649 --> 47:30.718
- I know.
- You gotta help me. You gotta help me.

47:30.818 --> 47:33.353
- She's everything to me.
- I know. We'll get her out.

47:33.453 --> 47:35.088
- Okay, thank you. Please.
- I promise.

47:43.664 --> 47:46.701
- Whose side are you on?
- I distracted him, didn't I?

47:47.735 --> 47:48.770
Call it.

47:49.136 --> 47:50.738
Oh, fucking who cares?

47:51.104 --> 47:53.273
Tails. You take the head.

47:53.908 --> 47:55.375
Goddammit.

47:57.011 --> 48:00.380
- Wait, wait. I gotta get my gun.
- Just come back for it.

48:04.351 --> 48:05.586
Move your ass!

48:05.686 --> 48:07.789
I'm carrying
the heavy part, Father.

48:07.889 --> 48:11.325
Years of alcohol and drug
abuse have taken a toll.

48:18.165 --> 48:19.633
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

48:20.400 --> 48:22.804
- I don't understand what's going on.
- Okay. Okay.

48:22.904 --> 48:24.137
I need you to be quiet, okay?

48:24.237 --> 48:25.773
Look, I'm not even a maid.

48:26.139 --> 48:28.076
Mr. Le Domas,
he just likes the way I dance.

48:28.175 --> 48:29.811
Okay, let's swap places.

48:29.911 --> 48:31.045
Yeah, cause they're looking for
me, they're not looking for you.

48:31.144 --> 48:32.847
So, come on. Come on.

48:32.947 --> 48:34.214
- Please.
- She's over here!

48:34.314 --> 48:36.550
- She's here! She's over here!
- No, no, no, no.

48:37.684 --> 48:40.788
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Ow, ow, ow!

48:42.056 --> 48:43.925
Help me, please.

48:44.025 --> 48:45.225
- Shit.
- Please.

48:54.102 --> 48:55.335
Shit.

49:15.123 --> 49:16.390
- Tony.
- Yeah?

49:16.490 --> 49:18.158
- What are you doing?
- Well...

49:18.258 --> 49:20.460
We're trying to
bring him back to us.

49:20.995 --> 49:22.295
Sir.

49:23.965 --> 49:25.198
Oh, man.

49:25.565 --> 49:26.566
Ow.

49:26.667 --> 49:29.137
I was unable to repair
the security system.

49:29.236 --> 49:31.438
The doors and windows
remain unlocked.

49:32.172 --> 49:33.473
Oh.

49:33.573 --> 49:36.376
And I'm afraid that
Dora has been crushed, sir.

49:36.844 --> 49:38.046
By the dumbwaiter.

49:38.146 --> 49:39.781
And then there were none.

49:40.114 --> 49:41.348
Jesus Christ.

49:41.448 --> 49:42.984
She's taking us all out.

49:43.084 --> 49:45.086
- How's she doing this?
- Sweetheart.

49:45.185 --> 49:46.754
It doesn't make sense, Becky.

49:48.321 --> 49:50.624
- She's a little blonde twig, and I don't...
- Tony.

49:53.293 --> 49:54.929
Take a minute.

49:55.029 --> 49:56.898
But just a minute.

49:57.497 --> 50:00.567
We can't let her get out.
We've got to guard the doors.

50:04.105 --> 50:05.873
He lost his way.

50:09.177 --> 50:10.945
You should never have
let him leave us.

50:11.045 --> 50:12.180
Excuse me?

50:12.512 --> 50:15.116
He and I have
always been so much alike.

50:15.215 --> 50:16.650
I knew the girl
would draw that card,

50:16.751 --> 50:18.920
and that he would face
the same choice I faced.

50:19.020 --> 50:20.287
Horse shit.

50:20.387 --> 50:22.489
None of us expected
to be doing this tonight.

50:22.924 --> 50:24.158
I got a tee time at eight.

50:24.257 --> 50:25.325
And, in case
you didn't notice,

50:25.425 --> 50:26.728
it wasn't much
of a choice for him.

50:26.828 --> 50:29.663
He's been helping her
from the get-go.

50:30.363 --> 50:31.833
- He hates us.
- No.

50:32.532 --> 50:34.836
He's simply afraid
of who he truly is.

50:34.936 --> 50:36.436
Like I was.

50:36.938 --> 50:38.940
You'll never know
how it felt that night

50:39.040 --> 50:43.510
<i>to be told that the only man
that I'd ever loved had to die.</i>

50:43.610 --> 50:45.278
<i>But I should not have
fought it.</i>

50:45.378 --> 50:47.447
I should have
killed Charles myself.

50:48.015 --> 50:50.517
There's still time for Alex
to do the right thing.

50:50.617 --> 50:52.920
He only has to
accept the truth.

50:53.020 --> 50:54.956
Uh, um, what truth is that?

50:55.056 --> 51:00.660
That he is meant to lead
this family, not run from it.

51:01.561 --> 51:03.597
He's hated our
pact from the very start.

51:03.697 --> 51:05.398
He's the good son.
Do you remember that?

51:05.499 --> 51:07.501
Then why is he
the only one of us

51:07.601 --> 51:10.938
who has ever seen
Mr. Le Bail in his chair?

51:11.038 --> 51:12.639
Good God. He was five.

51:12.740 --> 51:14.776
He was probably,
I don't know, dreaming it.

51:14.876 --> 51:16.476
Or maybe he made it up.

51:19.046 --> 51:20.915
Well, if you say so.

52:02.757 --> 52:04.859
"What up, dawg?"

52:04.959 --> 52:06.060
Idiot.

52:06.393 --> 52:07.627
Not much.

52:08.461 --> 52:10.097
Family shit.

53:42.023 --> 53:43.523
Georgie?

53:45.226 --> 53:46.894
Oh, thank God. Okay.

53:46.994 --> 53:50.264
Okay, listen, I know this is
really, really scary, but...

54:43.184 --> 54:44.218
Fuck.

54:55.429 --> 54:56.663
Shit.

54:59.300 --> 55:00.533
Fuck.

55:47.181 --> 55:48.215
Fuck.

56:52.513 --> 56:54.614
You little fucker!

57:15.035 --> 57:16.170
I got you.

57:18.439 --> 57:20.107
I got you, bitch.

57:25.246 --> 57:26.280
Fuck!

57:32.119 --> 57:34.989
She's outside, running
towards the north fence.

57:35.623 --> 57:36.857
I'll get the others.

58:19.934 --> 58:22.403
Help me!

58:22.503 --> 58:24.772
Please help!

58:37.585 --> 58:38.953
Help. Please help me.

58:39.286 --> 58:40.321
Help!

58:50.331 --> 58:51.966
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

58:56.370 --> 58:57.338
Help! Wait, stop.

58:57.438 --> 58:58.772
Please, please help me.

58:58.872 --> 59:00.374
Oh, thank God.
Thank you, thank you.

59:00.474 --> 59:03.043
- Get the fuck out of the road.
- Please wait.

59:05.112 --> 59:08.015
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

59:08.616 --> 59:10.384
You fucking animal.

59:10.484 --> 59:15.022
You piece of shit, little, tiny
dick-licker, fucking asshole, fucking I...

59:20.894 --> 59:22.429
Fucking rich people.

59:27.702 --> 59:29.069
Fuck.

59:52.693 --> 59:54.295
<i>She must've gone
into the woods.</i>

59:54.395 --> 59:56.196
<i>But don't worry, sir,
she won't get far.</i>

59:56.297 --> 59:57.898
<i>I'll find her.</i>

59:57.998 --> 01:00:00.034
<i>And I'll fix the fence
tomorrow.</i>

01:00:00.501 --> 01:00:01.402
Well...

01:00:03.504 --> 01:00:04.773
she's out.

01:00:06.507 --> 01:00:07.541
Well...

01:00:08.609 --> 01:00:11.045
this was fun.

01:00:11.445 --> 01:00:16.016
What do you say we, uh, divvy up the
wedding gifts at brunch tomorrow?

01:00:16.517 --> 01:00:20.321
Do you think
that this is a fucking game?

01:00:21.422 --> 01:00:22.456
Yes.

01:00:22.856 --> 01:00:24.892
Hide and seek, remember?

01:00:25.326 --> 01:00:32.132
Do you realize that if she lives till
dawn, that we're all gonna die?

01:00:34.234 --> 01:00:36.203
You all remember what happened
to the Van Horns, right?

01:00:36.303 --> 01:00:39.340
Um... didn't they just die
in a house fire?

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.810
Yeah, that's what
the press told you, but they...

01:00:42.676 --> 01:00:45.679
You don't wanna know how
they really died. Trust me.

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:47.481
No, you don't
fuck Mr. Le Bail.

01:00:47.581 --> 01:00:49.416
Mr. Le Bail fucks you.

01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:52.486
You couldn't have negotiated
better terms, huh, Vic?

01:00:52.586 --> 01:00:54.021
You couldn't have, uh...

01:00:54.121 --> 01:00:56.156
Oh, I don't know,
maybe talked him down

01:00:56.256 --> 01:00:58.492
on the whole
eradication clause?

01:00:58.959 --> 01:01:00.094
Well, here's to you, fucker,

01:01:00.194 --> 01:01:02.429
because now
we are all fucking fucked!

01:01:02.529 --> 01:01:04.998
I think you made your point,
sweetheart, thank you.

01:01:05.632 --> 01:01:06.735
Oh, holy dick.

01:01:07.101 --> 01:01:09.670
Go wait for Stevens.
He might need your help.

01:01:09.771 --> 01:01:12.106
Not you two.
I want you out of the way.

01:01:12.206 --> 01:01:13.974
Take the maids
to the goat pit.

01:01:14.074 --> 01:01:16.944
And, pumpkin,
try not to kill anyone else.

01:01:17.044 --> 01:01:19.880
Cleanup duty for the fuckups.

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.850
- No. Daddy.
- Come on, Em.

01:01:21.949 --> 01:01:23.283
Listen to your mother.

01:01:25.319 --> 01:01:29.089
Hey, hey. So, at what point
do we just cut and run?

01:01:29.189 --> 01:01:30.224
Right?

01:01:30.624 --> 01:01:32.192
I mean, come on. Right?

01:01:35.996 --> 01:01:37.998
Fuck you.

01:01:58.585 --> 01:01:59.653
Daniel!

01:02:00.822 --> 01:02:02.122
Daniel, help!

01:02:23.745 --> 01:02:25.379
Grace.

01:02:26.113 --> 01:02:27.381
Grace.

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.923
Why did she have
to pull "hide and seek"?

01:02:35.255 --> 01:02:36.290
Do you think it's real?

01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:37.892
What? That we'll implode

01:02:38.025 --> 01:02:40.661
or burst into flames, or
whatever, if we don't kill her?

01:02:40.994 --> 01:02:42.162
I don't know. Can you...

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:44.732
All right, I'll...

01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:48.635
- I need, I need you to...
- I can't. If you barf, I'll barf.

01:02:52.874 --> 01:02:55.810
One, two, three.

01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:57.211
Three.

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:02.884
But you were with them the last time
they played hide and seek, weren't you?

01:03:02.983 --> 01:03:04.051
Were you six, seven?

01:03:04.151 --> 01:03:05.652
Do you remember anything?

01:03:05.753 --> 01:03:06.788
I remember all of it.

01:03:07.254 --> 01:03:08.756
Alex was with me too.

01:03:09.056 --> 01:03:10.257
I tried to protect him.

01:03:10.357 --> 01:03:12.059
I don't know what he saw
or what he remembers.

01:03:12.159 --> 01:03:14.127
You always looked out for him.

01:03:14.228 --> 01:03:17.231
If that were true, I wouldn't
have let him marry Grace.

01:03:19.734 --> 01:03:21.335
He deserved a better brother.

01:03:26.139 --> 01:03:27.709
And we all deserve to die.

01:03:29.777 --> 01:03:31.411
My kids don't.

01:03:33.915 --> 01:03:35.215
Mommy?

01:03:35.884 --> 01:03:37.084
Honey! Georgie.

01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:40.020
Are you okay?
What are you doing out here?

01:03:40.755 --> 01:03:41.789
I...

01:03:42.957 --> 01:03:44.893
I followed that lady
down here,

01:03:44.993 --> 01:03:47.394
and I shot her
with that gun I found.

01:03:48.028 --> 01:03:49.263
Why would you do that?

01:03:49.363 --> 01:03:50.697
That's what everyone else
was trying to do.

01:03:50.798 --> 01:03:52.032
Oh, sweetie.

01:03:52.666 --> 01:03:54.702
I am so proud of you.

01:04:14.421 --> 01:04:15.322
Shit.

01:04:35.777 --> 01:04:37.444
Come here, Grace!

01:04:53.828 --> 01:04:55.195
Fucking asshole!

01:05:11.144 --> 01:05:12.512
You motherfucker.

01:05:48.116 --> 01:05:49.884
<i>Thank you
for calling Trip Safe.</i>

01:05:49.984 --> 01:05:51.786
<i>Please stay on the line
and you'll be connected</i>

01:05:51.886 --> 01:05:54.154
<i>to the next available
representative.</i>

01:05:54.254 --> 01:05:57.257
<i>Good evening. This is
Justin. Your call may be monitored...</i>

01:05:57.357 --> 01:05:59.994
People are trying to kill me.
Can you please help me?

01:06:00.094 --> 01:06:01.695
<i>Uh, yes, I can help you
with that.</i>

01:06:01.796 --> 01:06:03.497
<i>Um, do you need
medical assistance, or...</i>

01:06:03.597 --> 01:06:05.565
Can you call the police,
please?

01:06:05.666 --> 01:06:07.835
<i>Yes. I'd be happy
to help you with that.</i>

01:06:09.971 --> 01:06:13.975
<i>Sorry. The computer's
acting up again.</i>

01:06:14.075 --> 01:06:16.410
<i>Let me
just quickly reboot here.</i>

01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:18.913
Justin,
just call the fucking police.

01:06:19.013 --> 01:06:22.382
<i>Ma'am, it says here that
the car was reported stolen.</i>

01:06:22.482 --> 01:06:24.251
<i>I'm sorry,
but I have to shut it down.</i>

01:06:24.351 --> 01:06:25.619
No, what?

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.056
No, what the fuck?
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:06:28.156 --> 01:06:29.489
<i>It's company policy, ma'am.</i>

01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:31.092
- <i>There's nothing I can do.</i>
- No, no, no, please. Justin.

01:06:31.191 --> 01:06:33.193
<i>Just stay with the vehicle, ma'am.
Police are on their way.</i>

01:06:33.293 --> 01:06:34.628
Just start the fucking car!

01:06:34.729 --> 01:06:37.197
- <i>'Kay, there's no need for profanity.</i>
- Start the car, Justin!

01:06:37.297 --> 01:06:40.634
<i>Jesus, there's nothing I can do.
My hands are tied.</i>

01:06:48.076 --> 01:06:49.309
Justin.

01:06:50.044 --> 01:06:51.578
Hello? Justin!

01:06:51.678 --> 01:06:53.647
<i>Is there anything else
I can help you with?</i>

01:06:53.748 --> 01:06:55.248
Yeah, you can go
fuck yourself, Justin!

01:06:55.348 --> 01:06:58.886
<i>Okay. Thanks for using Trip Safe.
Have a great night.</i>

01:07:01.621 --> 01:07:04.025
Okay. You're okay,
you're okay, you're okay.

01:07:04.125 --> 01:07:05.492
Police are on the way.

01:07:07.661 --> 01:07:09.931
Police are on their way.
Everything's gonna be...

01:07:23.177 --> 01:07:24.444
Good night, Grace.

01:07:37.024 --> 01:07:39.426
Alex, is that you?

01:07:39.894 --> 01:07:41.796
Hey. Hey, you're safe now.

01:07:43.396 --> 01:07:44.631
We're leaving.

01:08:00.114 --> 01:08:01.249
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:08:01.348 --> 01:08:03.416
We're approaching
the rear gate, sir.

01:08:03.517 --> 01:08:04.986
<i>We'll be there shortly.</i>

01:08:05.585 --> 01:08:09.356
All right.
We are back in business.

01:08:32.947 --> 01:08:33.981
Tony.

01:08:43.456 --> 01:08:45.725
Hey, Stevens! Look behind you.

01:08:46.194 --> 01:08:47.426
<i>Stevens!</i>

01:08:49.563 --> 01:08:51.732
Turn down the fucking music,
you idiot!

01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:54.234
Oh.

01:08:58.005 --> 01:08:59.372
Oh!

01:09:04.111 --> 01:09:05.612
Oh, no.

01:09:23.029 --> 01:09:23.997
Oh, fuck.

01:09:24.098 --> 01:09:25.131
Fuck!

01:09:54.996 --> 01:09:56.030
Déjà vu.

01:09:57.798 --> 01:10:01.802
It's funny, I... came out here
to escape the madness.

01:10:04.005 --> 01:10:06.841
Thanks for crashing a car
into my tranquility.

01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:10.443
Daniel.

01:10:11.979 --> 01:10:14.949
You don't wanna kill me.
You don't want me to die.

01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:17.417
No, I don't.

01:10:17.517 --> 01:10:19.053
I like you, Grace.

01:10:20.021 --> 01:10:22.622
So let me go. Okay?

01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:30.097
I'm weak.

01:10:33.167 --> 01:10:34.467
You're a good guy.

01:10:35.036 --> 01:10:37.405
You're a really,
really, really good guy.

01:10:37.504 --> 01:10:39.974
And Alex, Alex loves you.

01:10:42.209 --> 01:10:43.677
And you love him.

01:10:47.547 --> 01:10:49.951
He's not gonna forgive you
if you do this.

01:10:51.518 --> 01:10:53.187
Maybe not.

01:10:53.287 --> 01:10:54.855
But at least he'll be alive.

01:10:55.689 --> 01:10:59.327
I can't let my entire family
die because of you.

01:10:59.427 --> 01:11:01.195
It's insane.

01:11:02.296 --> 01:11:03.764
Can't you see it's insane?

01:11:03.864 --> 01:11:07.500
No one's gonna die...
No one, no one is gonna die.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:10.171
And you can
do something about it.

01:11:10.271 --> 01:11:11.772
It's bullshit!

01:11:12.273 --> 01:11:13.506
No.

01:11:13.606 --> 01:11:15.843
I am not who you think I am.

01:11:16.344 --> 01:11:18.045
Alex is the one who got out.

01:11:18.145 --> 01:11:22.883
If anyone was gonna save you,
it would've been him.

01:11:30.057 --> 01:11:31.726
You can come out now.

01:11:37.798 --> 01:11:39.699
What, you knew I was here?

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.069
I'm drunk, I'm not blind.

01:11:42.502 --> 01:11:45.706
Ooh, we gotta move.
Less than an hour till dawn.

01:11:45.806 --> 01:11:48.209
And we still need to
prepare her for the ritual.

01:12:09.163 --> 01:12:10.798
Where's Grace?

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.235
She's indisposed.

01:12:18.305 --> 01:12:21.075
You didn't think I was just
gonna let it happen, did you?

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:28.716
With family,
one hopes for the best.

01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:31.085
The thing is...

01:12:33.254 --> 01:12:35.089
I like her.

01:12:36.891 --> 01:12:39.260
I don't wanna do this.

01:12:39.527 --> 01:12:43.798
But we have to
protect the family.

01:12:45.099 --> 01:12:46.133
If she dies...

01:12:49.136 --> 01:12:50.670
I'll kill you.

01:12:51.539 --> 01:12:53.941
Well...

01:12:54.809 --> 01:12:57.044
then I suppose
I'm dead either way.

01:12:57.511 --> 01:13:00.014
Yeah, and maybe it's a crock of
shit and nothing will happen.

01:13:00.114 --> 01:13:01.148
Oh, please.

01:13:01.715 --> 01:13:06.287
If you believed that, you wouldn't
have let her draw a card at all.

01:13:15.729 --> 01:13:17.765
Why did you leave us, Alex?

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:21.402
Oh, I don't know, Mom.

01:13:22.002 --> 01:13:26.841
I don't know. Maybe one night when I was
chanting and slicing the throat of a goat,

01:13:26.941 --> 01:13:30.677
it occurred to me that that wasn't
a completely normal thing to do.

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:36.150
But, and this is
what scared me the most...

01:13:37.785 --> 01:13:39.320
it felt normal.

01:13:41.422 --> 01:13:42.655
It did.

01:13:44.191 --> 01:13:47.995
And I realized that you'll
do pretty much anything...

01:13:48.095 --> 01:13:50.865
if your family says it's okay.

01:13:55.402 --> 01:13:56.971
And then I met Grace.

01:13:58.973 --> 01:14:01.308
She's the opposite
of all of you.

01:14:04.677 --> 01:14:06.280
She's good.

01:14:08.883 --> 01:14:10.918
And she made me feel
like I could be good too.

01:14:11.018 --> 01:14:15.956
So, if it comes down to
you or her, I choose her.

01:14:20.693 --> 01:14:22.229
I don't believe you.

01:14:24.999 --> 01:14:26.901
And I don't think
that you believe

01:14:27.001 --> 01:14:29.837
that a girl that you've known
for a year and a half...

01:14:30.738 --> 01:14:34.074
knows you better than I do.

01:14:51.659 --> 01:14:56.297
Our family has a very special
friend named Mr. Le Bail.

01:14:57.198 --> 01:15:02.570
Mr. Le Bail is the reason we
have all the nice things we have.

01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:08.075
<i>But sometimes Mr. Le Bail wants
something from us in return.</i>

01:15:08.175 --> 01:15:10.811
You got this, Fitch.

01:15:11.445 --> 01:15:12.780
You got this, Fitch!

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.682
Don't be a bitch, Fitch.

01:15:14.782 --> 01:15:17.718
Don't be a bitch, Fitch.
You got this, bitch.

01:15:21.388 --> 01:15:24.858
<i>I know tonight
didn't go as planned.</i>

01:15:24.959 --> 01:15:27.761
<i>But I'll make it right,
Mr. Le Bail.</i>

01:15:34.134 --> 01:15:35.169
You'll see.

01:16:56.016 --> 01:16:59.053
We renew our
pledge this night,

01:16:59.687 --> 01:17:01.723
as our ancestors before us...

01:17:02.523 --> 01:17:05.959
with this offering
of living flesh and blood.

01:17:16.437 --> 01:17:17.338
Hail...

01:17:24.978 --> 01:17:27.014
Brother!

01:17:35.389 --> 01:17:36.791
Poisoned!

01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:38.625
You son of a bitch!

01:17:38.727 --> 01:17:40.227
Oh, God.

01:17:46.166 --> 01:17:47.668
What did you give us?

01:17:47.769 --> 01:17:50.739
Stuff we poured on the maids.
White bottle, little red cap.

01:17:50.839 --> 01:17:52.473
Hydrochloric acid!

01:17:53.708 --> 01:17:55.342
Come on, up and at 'em.

01:18:04.753 --> 01:18:05.787
Grace!

01:18:06.887 --> 01:18:09.923
- Did you... Did you just kill 'em?
- No, I just gave them a nip.

01:18:10.023 --> 01:18:12.626
I Googled it. They'll shit weird
for a week, but they'll be fine.

01:18:12.727 --> 01:18:15.129
- Don't worry, I'll get Alex out too.
- Find them!

01:18:15.596 --> 01:18:16.997
We don't have...

01:18:24.471 --> 01:18:26.140
I knew you'd help me.

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.008
I didn't.

01:18:28.909 --> 01:18:31.945
All I knew was, at some point,
somebody had to burn it all down.

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:34.515
Never thought it'd be me.

01:18:34.615 --> 01:18:36.083
Daniel.

01:18:40.921 --> 01:18:43.023
Get out of the way.

01:18:48.962 --> 01:18:50.197
Charity.

01:18:54.034 --> 01:18:56.503
You really don't care
if I die.

01:18:57.171 --> 01:18:59.106
You don't have to...

01:19:16.290 --> 01:19:18.592
Daniel. Daniel. Daniel.

01:19:20.762 --> 01:19:22.029
Go.

01:19:23.964 --> 01:19:25.299
Thank you.

01:19:25.699 --> 01:19:27.134
Thank you.

01:19:33.775 --> 01:19:36.410
Where do you think
you're going, bitch?

01:19:39.179 --> 01:19:41.883
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

01:19:42.382 --> 01:19:45.018
Our family's
weathered worse than you.

01:19:46.286 --> 01:19:49.189
You're just another sacrifice.

01:19:50.123 --> 01:19:51.893
You're another goat.

01:19:51.992 --> 01:19:53.460
Fuck the altar.

01:19:54.027 --> 01:19:56.029
I'm gonna do it right here.

01:20:08.141 --> 01:20:10.444
Grace?

01:20:15.382 --> 01:20:18.585
Daniel. Daniel. Daniel.
Hey. Hey, hey.

01:20:18.685 --> 01:20:22.122
Hey. Look at me. Oh, my God.
Hey, hey, look at me.

01:20:29.363 --> 01:20:32.399
In my defense,
it's been a while.

01:20:35.970 --> 01:20:38.272
Don't go. Don't go, okay?

01:20:39.673 --> 01:20:42.777
Daniel, don't go! Don't go!
I need you, Daniel! Don't go!

01:21:00.028 --> 01:21:01.495
I meant what I said this
morning.

01:21:01.595 --> 01:21:03.597
I thought you were
gonna be the new me.

01:21:03.697 --> 01:21:06.400
But I'm not gonna let you
hurt my family!

01:21:17.144 --> 01:21:18.713
You can die.

01:21:25.987 --> 01:21:28.455
You don't deserve a family.

01:21:32.259 --> 01:21:34.161
Fuck your family.

01:21:39.968 --> 01:21:41.769
Fuck your fucking family!

01:21:46.206 --> 01:21:47.541
Grace.

01:22:24.277 --> 01:22:25.612
I'm sorry.

01:22:27.882 --> 01:22:29.149
I'm sorry.

01:22:33.888 --> 01:22:35.389
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

01:22:44.331 --> 01:22:46.299
Daniel's dead.

01:22:56.610 --> 01:22:58.946
You won't be with me
after this, will you?

01:23:23.171 --> 01:23:24.404
Alex...

01:23:24.939 --> 01:23:25.973
Alex.

01:23:26.941 --> 01:23:29.443
Alex.

01:23:30.677 --> 01:23:33.014
- You're hurting me.
- She's in here!

01:23:33.114 --> 01:23:34.614
No, please, no, no!

01:23:34.716 --> 01:23:36.117
Please!

01:23:36.216 --> 01:23:37.985
Let me go!

01:23:47.561 --> 01:23:48.595
Attaboy.

01:23:53.801 --> 01:23:56.269
Oh, Becky. Oh.

01:23:56.570 --> 01:24:00.208
The sun is about to rise!
We must do it now!

01:24:00.842 --> 01:24:04.478
It is time for your boys
to take their place.

01:24:21.763 --> 01:24:23.663
Deliver us, O mighty one,

01:24:23.765 --> 01:24:26.266
from all past error
and delusion.

01:24:26.566 --> 01:24:28.736
That, having set our foot
upon the path of darkness,

01:24:28.836 --> 01:24:30.838
we may not weaken
in our resolve.

01:24:30.938 --> 01:24:35.877
But, with thy assistance,
grow in wisdom and strength.

01:24:40.214 --> 01:24:42.315
<i>Shemhameforash!</i>

01:24:42.415 --> 01:24:44.218
<i>Shemhameforash.</i>

01:24:44.317 --> 01:24:45.519
<i>Shemhameforash.</i>

01:24:45.619 --> 01:24:47.354

<i>Shemhameforash!</i>

01:24:51.058 --> 01:24:52.894
Hail Satan!

01:24:53.161 --> 01:24:54.896
Hail Satan!

01:24:55.395 --> 01:24:57.397
Hail Satan!

01:24:57.497 --> 01:24:59.466
Hail Satan!

01:24:59.566 --> 01:25:01.334
Hail Satan!

01:25:01.434 --> 01:25:03.171
Hail Satan!

01:25:03.271 --> 01:25:04.638
Hail Satan.

01:25:24.158 --> 01:25:25.592
No.

01:25:31.299 --> 01:25:33.366
It is lost.

01:25:33.466 --> 01:25:36.503
Forgive us.

01:25:58.692 --> 01:25:59.861
Um...

01:26:00.995 --> 01:26:02.462
nothing's happening.

01:26:05.867 --> 01:26:06.834
I knew it.

01:26:07.034 --> 01:26:09.669
I fucking knew it.
It's all bullshit.

01:26:18.179 --> 01:26:19.814
Grace.

01:26:21.448 --> 01:26:22.682
Um...

01:26:24.551 --> 01:26:25.820
so, what...

01:26:28.256 --> 01:26:29.824
What should we do about her?

01:26:31.558 --> 01:26:33.627
I know it is too late.

01:26:34.095 --> 01:26:37.430
But I will not fail you again.

01:26:40.101 --> 01:26:42.469
The girl still dies!

01:26:48.575 --> 01:26:50.845
Oh.

01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:55.149
What the fuck?

01:27:01.055 --> 01:27:02.689
<i>Who wants to play a game?</i>

01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:04.992
