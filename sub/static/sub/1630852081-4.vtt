00:11.594 --> 00:14.222
<i>This season</i>
<i>on </i>Blown Away: Christmas…

00:15.432 --> 00:18.560
<i>Five artists from the past</i>
<i>were given the gift of redemption.</i>

00:18.643 --> 00:19.477
Back in business.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.146
Second time's the charm.

00:21.229 --> 00:22.605
Ho ho ho!

00:23.898 --> 00:28.570
<i>The holidays weren't very jolly</i>
<i>for Andi, Edgar, and Alexander…</i>

00:28.653 --> 00:30.447
Whoo! Oh boy.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.158
<i>…as they were asked to leave the hot shop.</i>

00:33.241 --> 00:34.367
Yeah.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.535
Whoo!

00:37.495 --> 00:41.541
<i> Cat and Nao are about to go head</i>
<i>to head in an all-out Christmas clash…</i>

00:41.624 --> 00:45.712
I'm definitely nervous.
I know how hard you have to push.

00:45.795 --> 00:49.299
There is no do-overs. Not gonna lie,
I feel a little bit of pressure.

00:49.382 --> 00:52.719
<i>…to find out who will be named</i>
<i>"Best in Glass."</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:57.766
I'm Bobby Berk, and this is
the finale of <i>Blown Away: Christmas</i>.

01:07.317 --> 01:11.780
Glassblowers, welcome
to the fa-la-la-la-la-la finale.

01:12.906 --> 01:16.659
Three challenges and
three competitors have come and gone.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.245
I'm still here.

01:19.329 --> 01:24.042
-Final two! Final two! Mm! Final two!

01:24.125 --> 01:26.795
Nao and Cat,
it's time for you to face off

01:26.878 --> 01:29.631
and turn your white Christmas green.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.425
After all, there is 20 grand on the line,

01:32.509 --> 01:35.762
including a $10,000 donation
to the charity of your choice.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.265
But before we get ahead of ourselves,

01:39.349 --> 01:43.812
Cat, I'd love to know what becoming
a<i> Blown Awa</i>y champion would mean to you.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.940
I got so close last time that,

01:47.023 --> 01:52.445
really, I want to prove it to myself
that I can actually go all the way.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.114
The Cat claws, they're not coming out,

01:54.197 --> 01:57.575
but, like, I'm gonna do everything
that I can to friggin' win this time.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.495
Nao, how do you feel
about competing against Cat?

02:02.163 --> 02:05.041
I've seen what she can do,
so I'm a little nervous.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.211
But on this challenge,
I'm trying to really focus on

02:08.294 --> 02:10.797
giving 100% of me for this final.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.300
All right, ready to get
this Christmas party started?

02:15.176 --> 02:18.263
For the last time this season,
cue the gallery doors.

02:22.517 --> 02:26.479
There it is, in all its empty
and intimidating glory.

02:26.563 --> 02:27.689
The gallery.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.693
Empty box. My favorite.

02:31.776 --> 02:35.029
I love it because
that's how I run my imagination.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.741
We expect you to turn
your half of the gallery into

02:38.825 --> 02:40.952
an epic winter wonderland.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.748
That could be anything
from ten lords a-leapin'

02:45.832 --> 02:48.418
to a tongue on a frozen metal pole.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.253
-Ouch!
-Mm-hm.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.589
It's all up to you
because this is your chance

02:52.672 --> 02:57.427
to get creative and let
your holiday imagination just go wild.

02:58.094 --> 03:02.223
But your installation must tell a story
and be exceptionally crafted.

03:02.307 --> 03:05.894
We're giving you seven hours
and three assistants each.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.687
I really think you're gonna need it.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.857
This is the time
when you really need to blow us away.

03:11.441 --> 03:15.737
I.e., make our little Grinch hearts
grow at least three sizes.

03:16.613 --> 03:19.782
You'll be judged
on your design, concept,

03:19.866 --> 03:23.077
technical execution,
and overall presentation,

03:23.161 --> 03:25.997
plus your entire holiday body of work.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.041
Nao, are you ready?

03:28.124 --> 03:30.043
-I hope so.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.753
-Cat?
-Let's do this.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.672
Your time starts now!

03:37.926 --> 03:40.845
Okay, so, "Winter Wonderland."

03:42.222 --> 03:44.599
I want to have snowflakes.

03:44.682 --> 03:48.853
I'm thinking, like, two big one
and, like, three small ones.

03:48.937 --> 03:53.608
I feel people underestimate me because
of my size or the color of my skin,

03:53.691 --> 03:56.736
but I think it's time for me
to show what I'm capable of.

03:57.278 --> 04:00.406
So we're basically gonna recreate,
like, this little creek,

04:00.490 --> 04:02.367
and then a couple trees.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.828
My installation is going to be
this memory that I have

04:05.912 --> 04:09.540
of taking my horse out with my dog.

04:09.624 --> 04:13.086
He always gets stuck in snow drifts
with his little butt sticking out.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.546
-We're just alone in the woods.

04:15.630 --> 04:19.384
I can't picture anything
about it clearly,

04:19.467 --> 04:21.886
except the feeling of peace.

04:24.597 --> 04:28.726
I'm making an amusement park
in winter wonderland theme.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.938
I'm trying to make
this Ferris wheel, using this wall,

04:32.021 --> 04:34.482
so that I don't have
to complete the whole spectrum.

04:34.565 --> 04:37.735
I've been wanting to make this
amusement park installation for years,

04:37.819 --> 04:41.781
but this challenge gave me the spark
to actually finish my project.

04:41.864 --> 04:45.118
I hope I can make everything very snowy
and, you know, pretty.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.370
-Great.
-Cool. Let's do this!

04:47.453 --> 04:49.330
-Let's go kick some glass! Yeah!
-Yeah!

04:53.876 --> 04:56.421
All right, you guys are gonna
set the benches and pipes.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.049
Someone go grab these colors.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.847
-Hope I have time to make everything.
-Yeah.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.974
Final two!

05:08.057 --> 05:10.351
I am so proud of myself.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.772
Just another day in the factory.

05:14.856 --> 05:20.820
There aren't a million opportunities
in glass where the top dogs are women.

05:20.903 --> 05:27.535
So for two ladies to get to the final
of the world's only glass competition

05:27.618 --> 05:28.703
is an achievement.

05:28.786 --> 05:31.956
-We're freakin' doin' it!
-I know, we're freakin' doin' it!

05:35.335 --> 05:36.502
Blow.

05:36.586 --> 05:40.173
It is not enough to make
a installation in seven hours,

05:40.256 --> 05:42.050
but that's the challenge, right?

05:42.133 --> 05:44.218
And then just kind of use this as a mold.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.015
Sick! I love it.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.854
So here we have all of Cat
and Nao's work

05:54.937 --> 05:56.814
throughout the holiday special.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.068
So these are
from our first challenge,

06:00.151 --> 06:03.029
which Cat won
with that amazing nutcracker.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.741
And then Nao's little
waffle platter there.

06:06.824 --> 06:10.161
I loved the story, I love the way
it looks, I love the mimosa.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.663
I think they both
did a really great job.

06:13.998 --> 06:17.877
Nao, through every challenge,
was always a very close second,

06:17.960 --> 06:19.003
until she wasn't.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.838
-Until she was first.
-Mm-hm.

06:21.756 --> 06:24.801
I love the feeling of this.
I think it so encapsulates

06:24.884 --> 06:27.553
Nao's personality,
and that joy that she has.

06:27.637 --> 06:31.849
I know you didn't like the color, but
I feel it reflects Nao and her passion.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.184
I agree.

06:33.267 --> 06:35.561
I can love it
and still not love the color.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.898
From a design standpoint,
who do you think has the edge?

06:41.359 --> 06:43.528
I-- I can't say.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.489
I think they've both grown
even in the last few challenges.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.707
I'm here because I want to win this time.

06:56.791 --> 06:57.875
Redemption.

06:57.959 --> 07:02.839
But I think Nao going to, like,
a next level is very scary for me.

07:05.466 --> 07:10.012
I don't have a strategy to beat Cat,
but I'm just gonna create my own world.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.891
I feel like this has been
a continuous journey from the season two.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.560
And upside down.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.395
It's still very hard for me

07:17.478 --> 07:20.148
to want something I cannot control,
like winning.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.942
And flip. Yep, great job.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.278
But since that last season,

07:25.361 --> 07:27.321
parents have been sending me

07:27.405 --> 07:30.908
the video of their children crying
because I got eliminated.

07:31.951 --> 07:35.496
Having those people,
having those new fans and their support

07:35.580 --> 07:37.373
really makes me want to win.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.167
Lift up.

07:41.878 --> 07:46.299


07:48.301 --> 07:51.929
I've got high expectations
for these two, 'cause time after time,

07:52.013 --> 07:56.100
in their original season
and in this Christmas special,

07:56.184 --> 07:59.061
have shown great technical skill
and creativity.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.731
-Mm-hm.
-We're making my puppy's butt.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.983
Oliver is my rescue Basset mix,

08:04.066 --> 08:06.444
and he is my constant companion.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.197
And flip.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.574
Before glass was my therapy,

08:11.657 --> 08:12.992
I would talk to animals.

08:13.075 --> 08:18.247
Animals were the only creatures
that I talked to for years, really.

08:18.831 --> 08:23.211
His tail is gonna need to be
at least up to about here.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.128
Okay.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.506
My charity is The Duchess Sanctuary,

08:26.589 --> 08:30.051
and it's a horse rescue
that is in Eugene, Oregon.

08:30.134 --> 08:32.053
And go and give it a push.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.471
Go ahead and lift up.

08:34.013 --> 08:38.184
When you're a non-for-profit,
every single penny makes a difference.

08:38.267 --> 08:41.521
So $10,000 could be a game changer.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.397
And hold.

08:45.191 --> 08:49.403
Animals were
the first thing that saved me, and…

08:49.487 --> 08:52.323
…glass is what
continues to save me.

08:52.406 --> 08:53.991
So I want to pay it forward.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.619
Gonna be a freaking cute dog butt.

08:57.662 --> 09:01.165


09:04.252 --> 09:05.127
Blow, please.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.128
-Blow?
-Yep.

09:07.255 --> 09:11.050
Katherine, when you're doing a gallery
display like this, how do you approach it?

09:11.133 --> 09:12.343
It's a big, white box,

09:12.426 --> 09:15.221
but it's nice to have parameters
that are themed to work with

09:15.304 --> 09:17.431
to kind of hone
your vision in a little bit.

09:17.515 --> 09:21.561
And these guys definitely have that
with this idea of a winter wonderland.

09:21.644 --> 09:25.565
I feel like we're gonna see
very different interpretations of that.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.149
So cute!

09:28.818 --> 09:30.653
I've done a lot of installation,

09:30.736 --> 09:33.406
so I have a pretty good sense
of how everything works.

09:34.448 --> 09:38.703
To be given a white gallery to have
an installation is kind of the dream.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.455
I want to dust off some white.

09:42.039 --> 09:44.333
In Japan,
I did a lot of installations.

09:44.417 --> 09:49.046
Once I moved to Seattle, I needed to make
something commercial to make a living.

09:49.130 --> 09:53.551
So, I didn't allow myself to spend
so much time making big installations.

09:56.053 --> 09:58.097
That looks like it's snowy enough.

09:58.180 --> 10:02.476
So, doing this gallery,
it's like I'm coming home.

10:11.402 --> 10:15.197
If you had to do a holiday display
in a window, how would you approach that?

10:15.281 --> 10:17.575
Very three-dimensional.

10:17.658 --> 10:20.786
Lots of layers, which is how
I always like to approach design,

10:20.870 --> 10:21.787
but still simple.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.164
Right, right.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.167
Right under my shears. Perfect.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.920
I'm making a forest in the gallery.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.341
Perfect.

10:33.924 --> 10:38.304
It takes nature years to make a forest,
and I have seven hours.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.765
-Crap.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.808
The trees are so important.

10:42.892 --> 10:48.022
If they look wrong,
then the entire rest of it falls apart.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.191
Let's just pull some cane.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.403
What is Cat doing
over there on the stairs?

10:54.487 --> 10:56.989
She is pulling cane
vertically,

10:57.073 --> 11:00.785
which is a way to make sure that it stays
really straight and even thickness.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.871
All right,
go and hold it right there.

11:04.622 --> 11:05.581
All right.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.042
Whoa.

11:08.834 --> 11:09.877
-Catch them…

11:09.960 --> 11:11.712
-Sorry.
-I got it.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.507
Every single one of them explodes.

11:17.259 --> 11:19.095
Whoo. We lost another one.

11:20.638 --> 11:27.186
The vertical pulling isn't working, so
I give up and I have to switch to plan B.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.773
I'm just going
to keep making shapes,

11:30.856 --> 11:33.067
and you're going to flatten them.

11:36.362 --> 11:40.908
Bobby doesn't like my color,
so I'm a little bit nervous.

11:40.991 --> 11:44.745
On the roller coaster,
I wanted to make a rainbow roller coaster.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.747
Each color has different energy.

11:47.790 --> 11:48.999
I need more color.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.877
Blue, yellow, and pink.

11:51.961 --> 11:55.589
Those indicate health, love, and money.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.550
Very good, very good.

12:02.722 --> 12:06.642
So Cat is literally
ladling glass out like soup.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.396
It's like a witches' brew!

12:10.896 --> 12:13.566
-
-What is she making?

12:13.649 --> 12:15.151
She's dumping it into water,

12:15.234 --> 12:18.821
which immediately makes the glass,
like, crack up into small pieces.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.114


12:20.197 --> 12:22.283

It looks a lot like snow or ice.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.702
Doesn't seem to be
a lot of technical skill in that.

12:25.494 --> 12:29.290
Not a lot of technical skill.
So I'm hoping that is a base layer

12:29.373 --> 12:31.751
for other things
that will exhibit more skill.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.253
Hopefully, she's finding a balance.

12:34.336 --> 12:39.258
Sorry, I'm watching Nao just have flames
all over herself and not even flinch.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.217
Flip.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.182
Look at her go.

12:46.265 --> 12:50.311
It's amazing that they do not
burn themselves more than they do.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.646
-Watch your legs.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.232
-You don't want it to sizzle on you.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.693
Honestly,
you really do get used to it.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.070
I've burned myself
I don't know how many times--

13:00.154 --> 13:02.072
But I would just be scarred up.

13:04.408 --> 13:07.369
This competition has been
a roller coaster of emotion.

13:10.498 --> 13:13.626
Sometimes I'm super excited,
and sometimes I'm so nervous,

13:13.709 --> 13:16.170
but all of it is part of the fun, right?

13:16.253 --> 13:19.089
-All right, flip.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.177
Roller coaster looks amazing!
You see all the curls?

13:23.260 --> 13:25.638
Like, that's all I wanted.
So I'm very excited.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.765
All right. What's next?

13:30.768 --> 13:33.270


13:33.354 --> 13:37.149


13:41.445 --> 13:43.614
-How's it going?
-Good! How's it going, Miss Kathy?

13:43.697 --> 13:44.573
Good.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.784
-A lot of space in that gallery.
-Yeah.

13:46.867 --> 13:49.578
-You confident you're gonna fill it?
-That's the thing.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.415
Every time I look at stuff, I'm like,
"We need more. We just need more of it."

13:54.875 --> 13:57.086
How's it been having
this kind of second chance?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.380
I feel very grateful to be here.

13:59.463 --> 14:02.424
You learned anything
about yourself in this process?

14:02.508 --> 14:04.760
I think what I've learned about myself

14:04.844 --> 14:09.139
is that I feel like I'm confident
enough now to stick to my guns.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.934
Where before, I maybe would have
changed my holsters.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.813
I'm not second-guessing myself
anymore, and that's been awesome.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.899
So, we'll be seeing
more of the true Cat?

14:18.983 --> 14:20.067
Yeah!

14:20.150 --> 14:21.610
Well, good luck…

14:21.694 --> 14:24.071
-Thank you.
-…getting finished and installed.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.077
How are you doing over there, babe?

14:30.703 --> 14:33.038
-I'm doing pretty good!
-Awesome!

14:33.539 --> 14:37.251
Cat is a production glassblower
who knows how to work with glass,

14:37.334 --> 14:40.504
who knows how to finish work
in a short amount of time.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.506
She pushes hard.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.633
So I have to push myself hard as well.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.094
I love the glass.
It's very challenging.

14:47.177 --> 14:49.638
Like, we can do some magnificent stuff.

14:49.722 --> 14:50.806
Close the door.

14:52.850 --> 14:56.562
-You don't meet a lot of people like Nao.
And go ahead. Shape it.

14:57.479 --> 15:00.190
She's got, like,
this eye of the tiger about her.

15:00.274 --> 15:03.277
So as a glassblower,
she's just a little fireball.

15:03.360 --> 15:07.406
You never know what she's gonna
come out with but it's always technically,

15:07.489 --> 15:08.657
classically well done.

15:09.992 --> 15:13.203
Wow, survived. Amazing.
I thought it's gonna crack.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.716
Hi, Nao. How's it going?

15:25.799 --> 15:28.969
-Guess what I'm making!
-Am I really off-base by saying a snowman?

15:29.053 --> 15:30.220
Whoa! How did you know?

15:31.388 --> 15:34.975
You want to tell me a little bit about
your vision for your winter wonderland?

15:35.059 --> 15:37.061
So I decided to make an amusement park.

15:37.144 --> 15:40.397
Now I'm making a snowman
to play on the roller coaster.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.482
Oh, okay.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.276
You think it'll be a nice holiday theme?

15:45.027 --> 15:45.861
Uh…

15:46.987 --> 15:48.697
Holiday-wise? I'm not sure.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.575
Like, there's so many things
we can do with winter wonderland,

15:51.659 --> 15:55.329
and I had to make a choice of
either following the narrative as it is,

15:55.412 --> 15:57.831
or to make it about my concept.

15:57.915 --> 16:02.544
So on this installation I wanted to have
that clear message why I'm here.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.463
So, what is that clear message?

16:04.546 --> 16:06.215
By changing the perspective,

16:06.298 --> 16:10.094
how we look at the world, we can make
this world a lot better and more fun.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.011
Sounds great!

16:11.095 --> 16:13.138
Right? I hope the piece
will come out okay.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.849
-Look forward to seeing it.
-Thank you so much.

16:15.933 --> 16:16.892
Okay, Nao.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.147
All right, Cat, Nao!

16:22.231 --> 16:25.567
You've got an hour left,
and don't forget, winner takes all.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.278


16:28.362 --> 16:30.155
Oh no, we broke it!

16:33.450 --> 16:35.077
Cat's signature laugh.

16:37.246 --> 16:40.833
Honestly, if you looked at it,
Nao and I's sides of the hot shop

16:40.916 --> 16:43.043
are complete and utter night and day.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.379
Nao's is very nice
and clean and organized,

16:45.462 --> 16:49.591
and my side of the hot shop
looks like a tornado went through it.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.052
Smash!

16:53.470 --> 16:56.223
I hear a lot of breaking glass
from Cat's side.

16:56.807 --> 17:00.310
Every time, those shards just keep
getting better and better. I love 'em.

17:00.394 --> 17:04.481
The more chaotic
the universe is around me,

17:04.565 --> 17:07.401
the more centered I feel.

17:13.282 --> 17:16.452
All right, ornaments are going great.
Horseshoes are going great.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.245
-Fastest rondelle ever.
-Yes!

17:18.328 --> 17:19.621
Time is running.

17:19.705 --> 17:20.831
We can do this.

17:21.457 --> 17:22.708
Oh, my God.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.001
Flip.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.211
I can feel I'm moving slower now.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.006
My body is physically done,

17:29.089 --> 17:33.552
and I still don't know if I have enough
to fill an entire installation space.

17:34.970 --> 17:39.475
All right guys, final five minutes!
Only five minutes left.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.186
Thank you for
the impending sense of doom!

17:42.269 --> 17:43.520
Push hard, Tommy.

17:46.982 --> 17:49.193
Making the pieces is the easy part.

17:49.276 --> 17:54.198
The fact that I have to make an install
is going to be, like, the horrific part.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.036
That was a beautiful rondelle,
Tommy.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.872
Good hustle, Ian!

18:02.372 --> 18:04.416
-Yeah!
-Merry freakin' Christmas!

18:04.500 --> 18:07.711
Guys! Oh, my God.

18:07.795 --> 18:11.840
I made all the parts I needed. I feel
really great going into the installation.

18:11.924 --> 18:12.800
Ah!

18:15.511 --> 18:18.013
Time is up, and I am feeling

18:18.097 --> 18:22.768
every muscle in my body
just screaming at me.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.943
You want to start here
and then work your way back,

18:31.026 --> 18:33.612
so that we can put that tree up first.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.155
The glassblowing was fun.

18:35.239 --> 18:38.408
The installation is going to be
an actual nightmare.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.994
Okay, guy, you just stick on there.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.914
Oh my God,
I don't even know how to do this thing.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.625
I thought the installation part
is going to be all right,

18:46.708 --> 18:49.211
but there's so many little tweaks
that I need to do.

18:49.294 --> 18:52.756
All right, so this is more hustle time.
We just need to get 'em up there.

18:53.841 --> 18:54.675
Shut up!

18:55.384 --> 18:56.927
Gonna be like this.

18:57.010 --> 18:59.888
So, like, that one would be
a little more closer to the ceiling.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.306
So, like, this orientation?

19:01.390 --> 19:02.724
Opposite direction.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.561
I can't get the snowflakes
to line up nicely

19:05.644 --> 19:07.563
to make it look like a Ferris wheel.

19:08.272 --> 19:12.067
No, but then it tried to go this way,
so I have to make a knot inside.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.861
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, exactly.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.195
I just have to get over it.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.447
Good enough. Yeah, let's move on.

19:20.659 --> 19:25.414
Just like in the hot shop, my installation
also has this chaotic kind of vibe.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.916
I need this whole floor covered,

19:28.000 --> 19:29.293
and smash it all.

19:29.376 --> 19:35.591
This installation is maybe one of
the least technical things I've done.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.677
I'm gonna hurt myself.

19:38.760 --> 19:43.390
But when it gets put together,
it becomes more than what it seems.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.142
Oh, that's good.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.144
Now, moving over to the roller coaster.

19:47.227 --> 19:48.729
So, like one here.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.482
And now, one small one here.

19:52.566 --> 19:55.152
I wanted all the roller coaster parts
on the pedestal,

19:55.235 --> 19:58.614
but it's too wobbly that it's not working,
so I have to hang it.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.407
It's gonna work.

20:00.490 --> 20:03.493
Right now, I feel like I can do anything.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.371
No one breathe.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.416
-I wanna make a little mountains here.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.296
Can you find me the best horseshoes?

20:14.379 --> 20:16.131
And we'll put them first.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.342
I'm definitely more tired than proud,

20:18.425 --> 20:22.888
but when I step back,
it's what I wanted it to be.

20:22.971 --> 20:26.433
This is the feeling when dreams come true.
I never had that before.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.602
I'm very proud of myself.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.787
I made my perfect winter wonderland.

20:47.829 --> 20:51.541
Everyone has their own
lovely memories of snow.

20:53.168 --> 20:57.881
It's about when you're out in nature,
everything feels like it's sleeping.

20:59.299 --> 21:03.845
It's not about one single piece,
it's the entire thing,

21:03.929 --> 21:05.264
like walking into a painting.

21:09.351 --> 21:12.187
So, I decided to make
amusement park in winter

21:12.271 --> 21:17.693
so that I can tell the story
that this Earth is actually fun.

21:19.027 --> 21:21.613
On this challenge,
I did a good combination

21:21.697 --> 21:24.616
of my expression and the technical side.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.416
Our final gallery inspection.

21:32.499 --> 21:33.583
You ready?

21:33.667 --> 21:35.919
-Do you really need me to answer that?
-No.

21:37.838 --> 21:43.176
This is Nao's side of the gallery.
"Winter's Wonderful Wild Ride."

21:43.260 --> 21:46.388
"Human existence is like
being in an amusement park in winter."

21:46.471 --> 21:50.100
"We can complain about our surroundings
and wonder why we are here,

21:50.183 --> 21:53.145
or make the most out of life
and embrace the chance to play."

21:53.812 --> 21:56.690
"This installation is composed
of three sculptures,

21:56.773 --> 22:00.569
a Ferris wheel of fortune,
a haunted house of cards,

22:00.652 --> 22:03.113
and a roller coaster of emotions."

22:04.323 --> 22:06.116
I love the exuberance here.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.411
There's a lot of movement
and color.

22:09.494 --> 22:10.954
She did go with the color scheme

22:11.038 --> 22:13.999
she went with last challenge that
I specifically told her I didn't like.

22:14.082 --> 22:16.668
But, hey, she's like,
"I don't care what Bobby likes."

22:16.752 --> 22:19.046
-"I'm gonna do it anyways."
-"I'm gonna show him."

22:19.129 --> 22:21.214
-"I'll make him like it."

22:21.923 --> 22:23.508
I do love the story.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.887
The Ferris wheel is actually
reminding me of some in Tokyo.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.889
-Oh! Okay.
-Color-wise.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.515
So that's making sense to me.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.225
I'm glad you mentioned that.

22:32.309 --> 22:37.356
I feel like if this had been installed
a bit more in a semicircle, we'd see it.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.149
I think it's very creative.

22:39.232 --> 22:42.778
I think the pieces are extremely creative.
They're very conceptual.

22:42.861 --> 22:46.907
Definitely abstract. I mean, we start
to see the roller coaster idea here.

22:46.990 --> 22:51.286
The house of cards, maybe not so much,
but that's a really beautiful tableau.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.915
Maybe this is the Ghost of Christmas Past
and the Ghost of Christmas Future,

22:54.998 --> 22:58.001
but I might have called it
a house of discs.

22:58.085 --> 23:01.129
-'Cause they look more like discs to me.
-They do.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.757
I appreciate the snow on it,
the little hat.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.425
I think that's cute and clever.

23:05.509 --> 23:09.262
It is pretty cute. This is
definitely a little bit of a wild ride.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.389
It was ambitious.

23:10.472 --> 23:13.809
She was trying to show something
that we probably wouldn't have imagined.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.143
I love it.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.187
All right.
Shall we head over to Cat's half?

23:17.771 --> 23:19.147
Um, okay…

23:19.815 --> 23:22.359
-Ah…
-Ooh. Oh…

23:22.442 --> 23:24.820
-Really?
-I like the crackle.

23:25.654 --> 23:28.907
Little unnerving.
We're falling through the ice.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.664
How do you like that sound?

23:35.747 --> 23:37.707
It seems to really bother you.

23:37.791 --> 23:41.837
I guess it has not such
pleasant associations, typically.

23:42.963 --> 23:47.801
But I do feel like these shards of glass
replicate that babbling brook feel.

23:47.884 --> 23:51.721
-"Cat's Winter Wonderland."

23:51.805 --> 23:54.099
"This installation is
a memory of absolute peace

23:54.182 --> 23:56.143
captured in all its fragmented beauty,

23:56.226 --> 23:59.312
and speaks to the serenity
Cat feels with her animals."

23:59.396 --> 24:00.230
-Aww.
-Mm.

24:00.856 --> 24:05.152
Overall, I think she's done a great job
of evoking being in the forest.

24:05.777 --> 24:09.364
The glass on the walls,
the branches coming down from the ceiling,

24:09.448 --> 24:13.827
these big, juicy,
fluffy snowflakes coming down.

24:15.078 --> 24:17.789
I can picture Cat
with her dog, on her horse,

24:17.873 --> 24:19.499
and just kinda being in heaven.

24:19.583 --> 24:23.462
Yeah. Story-wise,
narrative-wise, I get it.

24:23.545 --> 24:27.340
I wish, though, that all of her trees
looked like that branch up there.

24:27.924 --> 24:30.469
See what I mean?
It looks more realistic.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.137
It definitely looks more realistic.

24:32.220 --> 24:35.724
Yeah, I mean,
these ones here are very stylized.

24:35.807 --> 24:40.187
I think that is maybe an accommodation
for trying to get things done in time.

24:40.270 --> 24:46.067
I think Cat's really relied on quantity
over quality in a lot of the components.

24:46.776 --> 24:49.112
Both artists stay very true
to themselves.

24:49.196 --> 24:52.365
We have two very different artists,
we have two very different galleries.

24:52.449 --> 24:55.827
But I like that you knew
exactly whose was who.

24:55.911 --> 24:59.372
You did. I feel like both
of their temperaments and personalities

24:59.456 --> 25:01.625
-came shining through.
-Yeah.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.960
-Shall we bring the glassblowers in?
-Let's do it.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.345
I went through all this journey.

25:13.428 --> 25:14.596
I have no regret.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.934
I know what losing feels like,

25:19.017 --> 25:23.438
so all I really know is that
I don't want to feel that again.

25:24.898 --> 25:26.441
All right, Cat and Nao,

25:26.525 --> 25:28.818
it is the merry moment of truth.

25:29.569 --> 25:34.241
Both of your installations warmed
the cockles of our cold holiday hearts.

25:34.950 --> 25:37.077
Nao, looking at your installation…

25:38.370 --> 25:39.871
…what does it mean to you?

25:40.747 --> 25:43.416
This symbolize how much
I push myself.

25:44.751 --> 25:47.212
When you first arrived
in thehot shop,

25:47.295 --> 25:49.130
you weren't so interested in competing.

25:51.007 --> 25:52.968
But this time around, we saw a new Nao.

25:53.051 --> 25:56.263
I realize that I was scared
of wanting something,

25:56.346 --> 26:01.476
because wanting something is
creating an opportunity to break my heart.

26:02.060 --> 26:05.230
You've taken more risks and
pushed yourself out of your comfort zone.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.857
And thank you for seeing that.

26:08.692 --> 26:11.736
You may not have a lot
of experience at holiday glass,

26:11.820 --> 26:13.113
but you have a ton of heart.

26:15.031 --> 26:18.451
So, Cat, what does
your installation mean to you?

26:19.119 --> 26:22.289
-I do a lot of holiday trinkets.

26:22.372 --> 26:27.168
People kind of knock you as an artist when
your art is something that's sellable.

26:27.252 --> 26:31.256
So I think this kind of
proved to everyone that

26:31.339 --> 26:36.261
even though it's about a holiday,
it's completely valid and it is still art.

26:36.344 --> 26:39.848
I wouldn't want a creepy nutcracker
made by anybody but you.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.891
Thank you. That means so much.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.643
They weren't that creepy.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.061
No, they're pretty creepy.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.480
-Totally creepy. But in the cutest way.
-Yeah.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.863
You both have kicked glass.

26:55.947 --> 26:58.241
-I love you.
-I love you too.

26:58.325 --> 27:01.494
$20,000 in cold, hard holiday cash

27:01.578 --> 27:05.290
and the title of
"Best in Christmas Glass" goes to…

27:06.166 --> 27:07.167
This is it.

27:07.792 --> 27:11.129
-Like, holy crap, this could happen.

27:12.339 --> 27:13.173
Cat.

27:14.591 --> 27:15.675
Congratulations.

27:15.759 --> 27:19.095
-This was not easy.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.014
You guys are both amazing.

27:21.097 --> 27:23.433
Thank you so much.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.602
Oh.

27:25.685 --> 27:29.773
I feel completely and utterly
overwhelmed and excited,

27:29.856 --> 27:33.193
and I love Christmas
even more than I did before.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.613
I just know how many animals
are going to be helped by this.

27:36.696 --> 27:39.032
-That's awesome.
-Hello, Mother.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.451
<i>Hello, Caitlin. Where are you?</i>

27:41.534 --> 27:46.122
-Um, so I'm on the set right now.
-<i> Okay.</i>

27:46.206 --> 27:50.085
And I just needed to tell you that I won!

27:52.003 --> 27:54.839
<i> I just scared the crap out of Dad</i>
<i>and all the dogs!</i>

27:55.924 --> 27:56.841
<i>She won!</i>

27:56.925 --> 27:59.719
-Are you proud of me?
-I'm so proud of you!

27:59.803 --> 28:01.262
-I'm proud of myself.
-Good!

28:01.346 --> 28:04.015
I feel like it was meant to be
for me to come back here

28:04.099 --> 28:08.228
and do just a little bit more,
and I did so well. And I know that.

28:08.311 --> 28:09.854
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

28:09.938 --> 28:10.939
Don't you hurt me.

28:11.022 --> 28:13.817
Merry Christmas and
a happy freakin' New Year!
