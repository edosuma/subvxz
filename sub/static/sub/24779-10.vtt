00:06.005 --> 00:08.675
[bell tolling]

00:08.758 --> 00:11.928
[indistinct chatter]

00:12.762 --> 00:15.724
[narrator]  Ah, Winchester University,

00:15.807 --> 00:19.352
entangled in yet another
national controversy.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.646
[Nate] Guys, look.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.273
We're okay.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.691
Jesus.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.860
This is exactly why our tuition
shouldn't be paying

00:26.943 --> 00:28.528
Tan Coulter to speak here.

00:28.611 --> 00:31.781
Do you think this is gonna turn
into an Antifa situa'sh?

00:31.865 --> 00:33.074
Finals are tomorrow.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.285
Do people really feel this threatened?

00:35.368 --> 00:36.828
[Joelle]  Dear White People,

00:36.911 --> 00:39.080
something must've gotten lost
in translation.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.666
Malcolm told us it's okay
to celebrate our being black

00:41.750 --> 00:44.794
because in so many ways,
our being is under attack.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.254
-Oh, my God.
-I know.

00:46.337 --> 00:48.381
Student radio station,

00:48.465 --> 00:50.550
blaring it 24-7 in every open space

00:50.633 --> 00:52.719
is the only way they get can
people to listen.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.263
Not that. I mean, yes,
that's true and sad and annoying,

00:55.346 --> 00:57.474
but no, this says that quinoa

00:57.557 --> 00:59.267
is a form of systemic oppression.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.643
Oh, yeah. I heard that.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.604
Americans are so into quinoa

01:02.687 --> 01:05.065
that the Peruvians who depend
on it can't afford it anymore.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.191
We should do something.

01:06.274 --> 01:09.069
[Joelle]  Are we so base they had
to invent race to separate us?

01:09.152 --> 01:12.781
I know my hair don't bounce right
and my ass is too tight in these jeans...

01:12.864 --> 01:14.115
Hey, Coco!

01:14.199 --> 01:16.618
Um... Hi.

01:18.119 --> 01:22.457
Okay, this article says
the quinoa thing ended up being fake news.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.584
[laughs] Oh, my God.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.545
[narrator]  And if you're worried,
Winchester's community of great thinkers

01:27.629 --> 01:30.673
won't be able to figure their way out
of this racial conundrum,

01:30.757 --> 01:32.759
well, you might have a point.

01:32.842 --> 01:33.760
Watch closely.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.721
We cherish our wealthy, our successful

01:36.805 --> 01:38.223
and our ourselves

01:38.306 --> 01:41.017
to rid our thoughts of that nagging,
niggling notion

01:41.100 --> 01:43.061
that we are niggers because you...

01:43.144 --> 01:46.064
Is there a limit on how many times
you can broadcast that word?

01:46.147 --> 01:47.690
[Sam] We have a three "nigga" maximum.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.277
Is it just me, or are her eyes moving?

01:51.361 --> 01:55.240
Totally possible.
So... [sighs] what's the plan?

01:55.824 --> 02:00.453
This is a compilation of actual
secret society handbook scans.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.498
This one's missing its name,
but you see how the "X"s here

02:03.581 --> 02:05.750
match the ones here?

02:05.834 --> 02:07.377
It's got to be Order of X.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.795
Right?

02:09.462 --> 02:10.421
Hmm.

02:11.005 --> 02:14.175
In my research, I found
mentions of "an order"

02:14.259 --> 02:18.304
of former slaves and black students
conspiring to topple society...

02:18.388 --> 02:19.305
Sounds promising.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.515
But only up until the '40s.

02:20.598 --> 02:22.475
And white people through history hate--

02:22.559 --> 02:24.227
love a black revenge fantasy.

02:24.310 --> 02:27.355
So you don't believe it's real.
What about the online accounts?

02:27.438 --> 02:28.648
Anyone can make those.

02:28.731 --> 02:30.942
[Sam] Look, okay, it says here:

02:31.025 --> 02:32.694
"Candidates should watch closely

02:32.777 --> 02:34.237
for a sign they've been tapped.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.405
At midnight on finals eve,

02:35.488 --> 02:38.032
candidates must meet at
the designated location."

02:38.116 --> 02:39.701
[Lionel] Finals are tomorrow, Sam.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.953
[Sam] And I had an X just like
this one on my door

02:42.036 --> 02:43.163
when I got back.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.415
[Lionel]  So did I.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.041
I thought it was just malarkey,

02:47.125 --> 02:48.293
codswallop,

02:48.376 --> 02:49.294
fiddle faddle.

02:49.377 --> 02:50.336
Are you having a stroke?

02:50.420 --> 02:53.840
Sorry. A lot of my pleasure reading is
from the 17th century.

02:53.923 --> 02:57.302
Huey, Medgar, Barack. Who's left?

02:57.927 --> 02:59.762
All our heroes got got.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.097
Where did you get all this?

03:01.180 --> 03:03.349
[sighs] My dad, um,

03:03.433 --> 03:06.895
found these in a rare bookstore in town.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.730
He was saving it for graduation.

03:08.813 --> 03:12.400
Sam, we don't have to do this now.

03:12.483 --> 03:17.030
My dad believed that everything,

03:17.113 --> 03:20.200
even the worst things,
happen for a reason.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.036
It's been a shitty year, Lionel.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.539
I need there to be a reason.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.878
What if the Order is the piece
we've been missing?

03:31.961 --> 03:34.839
The leaders of the '60s were able
to make progress

03:34.923 --> 03:36.758
despite their differences.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.719
Now we can't even get through
a Black Caucus discussion

03:39.802 --> 03:43.181
without it devolving into
a Maury Povich DNA reveal.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.516
But what if there's a network of us,

03:45.600 --> 03:47.310
generations in the making?

03:47.393 --> 03:49.354
We could be on the front lines of this.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.396
[Lionel sighs]

03:50.480 --> 03:53.358
We only have a few hours
to figure out where to meet.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.610
That's if they're real.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.904
Where have they been this whole time?

03:57.987 --> 04:01.324
Something is here,
and it's calling you and me.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.786
Are you really going to pass up
a chance to answer?

04:05.536 --> 04:07.121
[phone chimes]

04:13.711 --> 04:16.172
[sighs] I have tons of research--

04:16.756 --> 04:18.883
enough to be committed,
but let me go through it

04:18.967 --> 04:20.218
and see what I can come up with.

04:20.718 --> 04:22.553
-I can help.
-[Lionel] No.

04:22.637 --> 04:23.930
You already have something to do.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.307
But I'll text you if I find anything.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.685
Okay. Thanks, Lionel.

04:28.768 --> 04:29.686
[phone chimes]

04:33.189 --> 04:35.733
There was a coup, and it was
black bodies remind

04:35.817 --> 04:37.819
for their red, white and blue.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.946
When I see the pain
in Dr. King's stare,

04:40.029 --> 04:42.615
a pain Baldwin said was
put there by design...

04:42.699 --> 04:44.075
Who knows what any of that means,

04:44.158 --> 04:45.535
but it don't sound friendly.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.078
[chuckles]

04:47.161 --> 04:49.497
Rikki Carter is a known shit-stirrer,

04:49.580 --> 04:52.125
and clearly this appearance
will be no different.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.168
Now especially with Carson's cancellation,

04:54.252 --> 04:57.922
these kids could create a situation
outside the auditorium.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.008
[Fairbanks] Which kids do you mean?

05:01.509 --> 05:02.844
Dean.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.138
Be alert and ready for anything.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.935
[Joelle]  Read from the pages
of heroes in ages

05:11.019 --> 05:12.603
where everyone had your hue.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.856
This is bullshit.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.941
Well, you don't have to suffer
it much longer, Ames,

05:17.066 --> 05:18.943
since this is your last week.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.030
Don't let the door hit you in
the ass on the way out.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.531
Better yet, let it.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.659
My brother, uh, got me a job on the force,

05:26.743 --> 05:29.537
so my ass is fine.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.873
I'll be a "statie" by this time
next month.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.583
So you watch your speed, Walter.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.044
[Joelle]  Let our heroes bloom
above our heads

05:36.127 --> 05:37.837
and lead us to our dream,

05:37.920 --> 05:39.297
and our salvation is linked

05:39.380 --> 05:41.382
because despite the animal instincts

05:41.466 --> 05:44.677
that pulse in our gray matter,
our blood is the same.

05:44.761 --> 05:49.307
[moaning]

05:50.391 --> 05:52.351
Why are you so cruel?

05:52.435 --> 05:56.898
Ooh, the shrill timbre
of Joelle's slam poetry is destabilizing.

05:56.981 --> 05:59.150
And why do you still have a clock radio?

05:59.901 --> 06:01.944
It's... ironic.

06:02.028 --> 06:05.239
I'm... lazy. Pick one.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.784
Just get back over here.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.035
[Coco moans]

06:09.118 --> 06:10.328
Watch it.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.330
You almost got the lips.

06:12.413 --> 06:15.291
Oh, what was I thinking?

06:15.708 --> 06:17.335
How are we supposed to avoid the monotony

06:17.418 --> 06:20.588
of an actual relationship
if I go kissing you on the lips?

06:20.671 --> 06:23.382
I'd really hate to have
to get to know you.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.968
My black card is teetering
on the edge of revocation.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.554
Plus, I have no interest.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.139
-Oh, really?
-Mnh-mnh.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.058
No interest?

06:32.141 --> 06:33.684
That's why you're all up in my DMs.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.896
I needed your help. [laughs]

06:36.979 --> 06:38.397
That's not all you needed.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.941
Mmm.

06:40.608 --> 06:43.027
-Oh, your caustic wit...
-Hmm.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.613
a CrossFit body and aversion
to commitment...

06:45.696 --> 06:48.741
-Go on.
-[laughs] ...were a surprise,

06:48.825 --> 06:51.119
but I'm not interested in anything heavy.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.578
Doesn't get lighter than me.

06:52.662 --> 06:57.083
Hmm. Thank you, by the way.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.210
I just have to get
the Black Caucus on board.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.170
Hmm. You haven't told them yet.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.632
Mnh-mnh. Couldn't risk it getting out.

07:04.715 --> 07:07.385
Our little list of secrets is racking up.

07:07.468 --> 07:08.594
Mm-hmm.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.388
[phone buzzes]

07:12.056 --> 07:15.184
Speaking of.

07:15.643 --> 07:16.936
Do you want me to say hi for you?

07:17.395 --> 07:19.313
[chuckles] Do what you want.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.108
Either way, 15 minutes
ain't all that much time.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.901
-You're right about that.
-Yeah.

07:27.029 --> 07:27.864
[Kurt] Yo.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.365
-Hey.
-What's good?

07:29.449 --> 07:30.491
'Sup, man?

07:31.242 --> 07:32.535
[Kurt] What's going on?

07:38.249 --> 07:40.835
I need you to look at this.

07:40.918 --> 07:43.212
And this is...

07:43.296 --> 07:45.590
It's my sketch packet for  Pastiche.

07:45.673 --> 07:48.509
I got one where Rikki Carter
goes on Ancestry.com

07:48.593 --> 07:49.677
and finds out she's black.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.679
[Kurt laughs] Nice one.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.892
The packet's a little thin.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.019
Look, cut the shit.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.687
I know what this is.

08:00.354 --> 08:01.689
Just get me into the parties.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.649
I'll take it from there.

08:03.733 --> 08:04.901
All right. [sighs]

08:04.984 --> 08:06.402
I'll help you out,

08:06.486 --> 08:09.614
but it's not like freshman year.
It's a whole process now.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.073
What's that mean?

08:11.574 --> 08:14.202
You need more samples.
That's just a start, okay?

08:16.871 --> 08:18.789
[Al] Hey, Troy!

08:18.873 --> 08:20.374
Hey, nigga!

08:20.458 --> 08:22.752
Troy! Now's our time, man.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.337
Can you speak up?

08:24.420 --> 08:26.172
Man, I said, now's our time.

08:26.255 --> 08:28.049
What the hell are you talking about, Al?

08:28.132 --> 08:30.134
I'm talking about carpe-ing
the motherfucking diem.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.386
About finding out who started the fire.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.640
About getting the undeniable
proof via security footage

08:35.723 --> 08:37.517
that Davis House was burned intentionally

08:37.600 --> 08:39.352
to integrate A-P.

08:39.435 --> 08:41.562
Those security fucks just
rolled out to handle

08:41.646 --> 08:43.272
what might come of this Rikki situation,

08:43.356 --> 08:45.900
leaving a path to the truth.

08:45.983 --> 08:49.237
Yeah, I'm gonna pass, but, um,
Godspeed, Al,

08:49.320 --> 08:51.405
and his weird-ass crew
who just co-signed him.

08:51.489 --> 08:55.034
You're gonna be on the wrong side
of history on this one, Troy! Man!

08:55.117 --> 08:58.412
[Coco] You all know what our
campus security is capable of.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.289
The only way to bring Rikki down

09:00.373 --> 09:02.875
is to keep the plan a total secret.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.126
Can we help you, Troy?

09:04.210 --> 09:07.797
Come on, Coco. He's one of us.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.049
Guys, if this is about Rikki,

09:10.132 --> 09:11.842
I'm good.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.135
My rally days are done.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.137

09:15.846 --> 09:16.764
Good luck, guys.

It's like a "Street Fighter" combo.

10:11.944 --> 10:12.862
Hadouken!

10:12.945 --> 10:13.988
[chuckles]

10:14.071 --> 10:15.239
Ah! Abort!

10:15.323 --> 10:16.324
Abort!

10:16.407 --> 10:18.075
Where's the lube?

10:18.159 --> 10:19.869
I need an APB on the lube.

10:19.952 --> 10:20.953
Found it.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.121
[Wesley] Sorry.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.749
That was just a lot to take at once.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.547
[moaning continues on TV]

10:31.922 --> 10:34.258
[Wesley] Okay. Now do that again,

10:34.342 --> 10:35.885
but slow.

10:36.844 --> 10:37.845
Okay.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.982
[Wesley moaning]

10:51.942 --> 10:53.444
I love you.

10:53.527 --> 10:54.695
What was that?

10:55.363 --> 10:58.407
Uh... hey, boo.

11:00.242 --> 11:03.287
[both moaning]

11:03.371 --> 11:06.999
After her co-starring role on
Prince-O-Palities,

11:07.083 --> 11:09.418
P Ninny's star was on the rise.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.838
But when Bossip broke the news
that P Ninny and Trill Stein's

11:12.922 --> 11:16.050
relationship was a sham,
audiences turned on her

11:16.175 --> 11:19.428
faster than NFL owners turn
on their players.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.681
I wish we could stay like this all day.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.935
Why can't we?
Top-secret writer nerd stuff?

11:26.018 --> 11:28.521
[sighs] Something like that.

11:28.604 --> 11:29.814
Trill knew I was a lesbian.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.273
-Okay.
-The public did, too.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.441
They were just in denial.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.734
Look at my clothes.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.319
Well, yes.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.863
Look, P Ninny is a character I created,

11:37.947 --> 11:40.908
and there's nothing people hate
more than a boss-ass bitch.

11:40.991 --> 11:41.909
They do hate it.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.245
Particularly a black butch
with a light face-beat.

11:44.328 --> 11:45.538
That you do, girl.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.415
These dudes out here,
they're threatened

11:47.498 --> 11:49.250
by, like, black lesbians.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.293
That's why they try to hide us.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.711
We end up hiding ourselves.

11:52.795 --> 11:56.048
I can't believe she got dropped
from  Trap House Tricks  over this.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.552
Hmm. Another win for our oppressive
heteronormative society.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.011
Right?

12:01.470 --> 12:04.682
Nothing good can come from sex
and gender norms.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.684
Except monogamy.

12:07.184 --> 12:08.769
No, come on.

12:08.853 --> 12:12.940
This whole "finding the one" thing,
it's total bullshit.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.610
I'm glad we don't have to play
by those rules.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.196
Right.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.615
[Dereca]  But let's get into
your hit single,

12:21.699 --> 12:26.495
"Gimme Dat Peen-Peen
(I Love a Ding-a-ling)."

12:26.579 --> 12:29.415
First question, why the parenthetical?

12:29.498 --> 12:32.042
My rose would definitely be

12:32.126 --> 12:34.628
punching that hotep in the mouth.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.213
My thorn...

12:37.882 --> 12:40.092
Seeing you with that nigga
in the first place.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.887
He didn't deserve you.

12:44.638 --> 12:48.058
Yeah, well, he...didn't just talk
about what I deserved and didn't.

12:48.142 --> 12:51.061
He... made a move.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.938
He made me feel chosen.

12:55.399 --> 12:57.693
[Dereca]  I know what this requires.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.070
Is that for me?

13:00.154 --> 13:01.155
You know it is.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.032
-Damn it.
-Uh!

13:03.115 --> 13:05.326
Oh, yes.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.786
There's the pain, all over my chest.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.998
Yo. Shit just got messed up
at campus security,

13:11.081 --> 13:12.541
'cause that rent-a-cop was there.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.293
What do you say about rushing ole dude?

13:14.376 --> 13:16.462
Ask for his ID, teach him a lesson.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.172
Then after we've doled out our revenge

13:18.255 --> 13:20.508
over getting shot in the shoulder,
nearly paralyzing you--

13:20.591 --> 13:21.592
What? That didn't happen.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.803
-Nigga, you was there!
-We can steal the security tape.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.931
Seriously, I know the moment's
got you all hyped right now,

13:27.014 --> 13:28.974
but you need to let
whatever this is go, man.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.310
You should really join the rest
of Black Caucus.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.813
We done with rallies and protests,
whatever y'all got planned.

13:33.896 --> 13:34.813
But, Al--

13:34.897 --> 13:37.775
It's just a bunch of people
screaming opinions at each other.

13:37.858 --> 13:38.859
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.028
We got to try something new.
Come on, y'all.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.279
[woman] Yeah, let's go.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.782
They keep security footage
on the network drive

13:44.865 --> 13:46.242
in Fitzgerald Hall.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.538
Just pretend you're CS majors.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.333
Try to pretend you're CS majors.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.043
Good lookin' out, fam.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.629
[woman] Let's do this.

13:59.672 --> 14:00.798
[Joelle sighs]

14:00.881 --> 14:02.466
[Reggie] What's that above the doorknob?

14:02.550 --> 14:05.094
[Joelle] I don't know,
but it's a step above hate bananas,

14:05.177 --> 14:06.387
so I'm rolling with it.

14:06.470 --> 14:10.558
-[Reggie laughs] Sam's not home?
-Working on a project with Lionel.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.189
[Joelle] What's wrong, weirdo?

14:18.148 --> 14:20.025
Nothing. Uh...

14:20.109 --> 14:24.071
You never told me your
rose and thorn thing.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.992
Well, uh,

14:29.535 --> 14:33.622
my thorn was definitely singing
a "Call Tyrone" to you

14:33.706 --> 14:34.915
and that girl from Smith.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.458
[Reggie] Really?

14:36.542 --> 14:37.710
Why?

14:39.169 --> 14:41.171
You know why, Reg.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.406
I'm sorry.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.741
I didn't earn that.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.201
You know that's why I never...

15:11.285 --> 15:12.953
[scoffs]

15:13.037 --> 15:15.956
-...tried anything.
-Sam is why.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.250
I'm the next choice.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.295
I didn't want to get in between friends

15:21.378 --> 15:23.505
over something that was so complicated.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.466
Especially when the girl
of my fucking dreams

15:25.549 --> 15:27.593
was just gonna reject me anyway.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.720
And that girl's you.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.140
I couldn't even admit that
to myself until...

15:33.682 --> 15:35.017
Hotep Harry.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.268

Oh, hey, Sam.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.242

16:40.249 --> 16:43.293
Y'all know you don't owe me shit, right?

16:44.128 --> 16:46.213
Except a sock on the door.

16:46.296 --> 16:47.923

Hey.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.525
Hey.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.987
[bell tolls in distance]

17:18.245 --> 17:19.496
Almost time.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.079
[Sam] Rikki.

18:00.788 --> 18:03.165
[Gabe] I really hope that's
what you've nicknamed my penis.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.250
[Sam laughing]

18:07.753 --> 18:10.089
I just can't wait to capture the moment

18:10.172 --> 18:13.175
when her edges dissolve to nothing

18:13.258 --> 18:15.469
as I read her for filth.

18:15.552 --> 18:16.637
You're gonna read to her?

18:17.221 --> 18:19.556
Gabe, don't be white right now.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.185
So this is for your doc final?

18:23.268 --> 18:25.729
Yeah, it's the last piece.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.190
I thought I'd stop after
the blackface party,

18:28.273 --> 18:30.859
but then... racism.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.027
[Gabe] Hm.

18:34.530 --> 18:37.908
I never get this nervous. Um, it's weird.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.578
And then there's, um...

18:44.498 --> 18:46.667
You know what, it's probably nothing.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.627
You can't predict the outcome.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.047
Usually you can go in there, show up,

18:52.131 --> 18:54.133
capture what you're meant to.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.093
This chick?

18:56.176 --> 18:58.178
No one can agree on her.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.972
She's a gray area.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.558
I hate those.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.727
The world isn't black and white.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.984
Like, what color is this?

19:14.903 --> 19:17.447
This is...

19:19.032 --> 19:21.243
something I can't explain.

19:22.411 --> 19:23.829
[Gabe] Hm.

19:23.912 --> 19:26.707
This is something that might not work.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.044
Is this something you want to stop?

19:35.591 --> 19:36.967
No.

[phone chimes]

19:43.724 --> 19:45.684

[Gabe clears throat]

19:49.479 --> 19:50.898
All right, I gotta go.

19:50.981 --> 19:51.940
I'll see you later?

-Yeah.
-[laughs]

How are we supposed to get
to the library with all this?

20:04.703 --> 20:06.288
[Alexis] It's so inconvenient.

20:06.371 --> 20:07.414
Hey, Kelsey.

20:28.518 --> 20:29.645
[Silvio] Guys.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.647
The Alt Ivy metrics are not
what they used to be.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.483
We need to amp this up.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.817
[man] On both sides.

20:35.901 --> 20:36.860
[Silvio] Seriously.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.910
[distant chatter]

20:55.128 --> 20:56.088
Excuse me.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.090
You can't be back here.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.342
[Rikki] Denise, it's a fan.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.718
I'm no fan.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.388
[Rikki] Give us the room. Denise.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.431
[Denise] That lace-front's not
gonna set itself.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.684
Denise, what the fuck?

21:11.353 --> 21:13.063
My name is Samantha White,

21:13.146 --> 21:15.607
I'm a film student,
and I just want to ask you a few--

21:15.691 --> 21:17.067
That light okay?

21:17.401 --> 21:18.402
What?

21:18.485 --> 21:20.696
With that thing and the lights,

21:20.779 --> 21:22.656
might look a little rough, no?

21:24.700 --> 21:26.285
This is my aesthetic.

21:29.496 --> 21:30.414
Sam.

21:32.582 --> 21:36.545
Is it weird that I'm kind of
fangirling right now?

21:36.628 --> 21:38.755
It's weird, right? Sorry.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.426
Once I got through that
uninspired  Dear Right People  drivel

21:42.509 --> 21:46.138
on the plane over,
I completely rabbit-holed into your show.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.181
God, you've got talent.

21:49.891 --> 21:50.934
Thank you.

21:51.018 --> 21:54.479
And I love the character.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.690
She's sister-girl,

21:56.773 --> 22:00.569
but can articulate the fuck out
of a multisyllabic synonym for oppression.

22:00.694 --> 22:01.737
It's genius.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.781
She is not a character. I'm--

22:04.865 --> 22:06.700
No, not yet, but give her time, hon.

22:07.075 --> 22:09.995
Keep building up a following online.

22:10.078 --> 22:13.248
Maybe get a few bookings
in the local news circuit.

22:13.749 --> 22:14.958
In no time, you'll be on cable.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.168
What are you talking about?

22:16.251 --> 22:18.170
It's so easy nowadays.

22:18.253 --> 22:19.546
Just wait for a shooting.

22:19.629 --> 22:20.881
Any kind'll do.

22:20.964 --> 22:23.050
Unarmed black teen, a school, a church,

22:23.133 --> 22:25.093
or wherever the next
misogynistic white lunatic

22:25.177 --> 22:26.428
decides to unload his gun.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.680
Just hop on that talking head train,

22:28.764 --> 22:30.974
because when the world gets hold of her,

22:31.058 --> 22:32.559
game over.

22:32.642 --> 22:34.686
You sure there's gonna be enough light?

22:37.481 --> 22:39.983
The big fish is the book deal, of course.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.860
That's where you concretize her,

22:41.943 --> 22:43.779
put her on record to be quoted and echoed

22:43.862 --> 22:45.947
into a future where you'll
scarcely remember the girl

22:46.031 --> 22:47.282
who wrote the damn thing.

22:47.866 --> 22:51.995
Hey, maybe we could start a feud
and release our books the same month.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.246
Carson and I did.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.248
With all due respect,

22:56.291 --> 22:57.709
the fuck is wrong with you?

22:57.793 --> 22:59.795
That wasn't respectful at all.

22:59.878 --> 23:03.006
Why is there a Nielsen meter
where your heart should be?

23:03.090 --> 23:04.424
Wait.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.550
I already know.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.427
I know exactly who you are.

23:07.511 --> 23:08.720
[Rikki] Of course you do.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.514
Only difference between you and me
is time.

23:10.597 --> 23:12.265
Will you shut up and let me deliver

23:12.349 --> 23:14.101
this read I've prepared?

23:21.900 --> 23:23.902
I do have an event coming up.

23:24.861 --> 23:25.821
Shit.

23:26.530 --> 23:27.781
[sighs]

23:28.365 --> 23:30.408
I have rehearsed this
in my head since the day

23:30.492 --> 23:31.743
I discovered you.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.161
Know what's historically America's

23:33.245 --> 23:36.164
most popular form
of entertainment besides porn?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.457
Minstrelsy.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.084
Ding, ding, ding.

23:39.167 --> 23:42.087
Tops in gross numbers
and cultural influence,

23:42.170 --> 23:45.090
and they have never stopped putting us
on the stage to dance for them.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.842
Doesn't matter what part you play,

23:46.925 --> 23:48.677
so long as the distraction helps those

23:48.760 --> 23:53.223
with the real power keep their fiefdoms
nice and hidden.

23:53.306 --> 23:54.516
I'm not on a stage.

23:54.599 --> 23:55.934
You are literally on a stage.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.728
But I mean that metaphorically, too.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.188
How do you sleep at night?

24:00.272 --> 24:01.898
Indica dominant hybrid.

24:03.191 --> 24:05.277
And keeping in mind that
I'm stacking these checks

24:05.360 --> 24:08.196
so I can build a goddamn kingdom
of my own.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.240
Because in this country,

24:10.323 --> 24:12.742
all that matters is who holds
the gold and owns the land

24:12.826 --> 24:14.703
and its many resources.

24:14.786 --> 24:15.829
I'm not like you!

24:15.912 --> 24:17.956
I have way too much honor.

24:18.039 --> 24:19.207
Please.

24:20.709 --> 24:24.045
You "popped" at a white college

24:24.129 --> 24:26.173
while espousing a philosophy
that would've been

24:26.256 --> 24:29.551
only mildly interesting
if this were an HBCU.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.345
I got my start arguing
absurd right-wing views

24:32.429 --> 24:34.306
so I could win debate championships.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.726
So what if you're good this week
and I'm bad the next?

24:37.809 --> 24:42.314
What matters most is who is
powerless and who is powerful.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.900
We both picked what worked
for us because girls like us need

24:44.983 --> 24:48.195
to get from the former to
the latter as soon as possible,

24:48.278 --> 24:50.197
by any means necessary.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.243
[Gordon] Are you serious?

24:56.286 --> 24:59.581
Ms. Carter, I am so sorry
for whatever is happening here.

24:59.664 --> 25:00.832
I'll escort her out.

25:02.834 --> 25:03.835
I think we're done.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.548
I wish you would.

25:09.507 --> 25:10.967
[Gordon] We're thrilled to have you.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.094
It's so important for us
to have a person of color

25:13.178 --> 25:14.054
who can really just--

25:14.137 --> 25:15.847
Okay. Got it.

25:21.019 --> 25:23.355
Hi. Welcome.

25:23.438 --> 25:25.649
On behalf of Winchester's
Young Republicans,

25:25.732 --> 25:28.693
Dear Right People  and myself,

25:28.777 --> 25:32.656
I'd like to thank you
for braving the hordes outside to...

25:35.200 --> 25:36.243
[Silvio] Um...

25:37.702 --> 25:39.996
So, um,

25:40.080 --> 25:42.415
please welcome our guest Rikki Carter.

25:44.334 --> 25:45.794
What kind of intro was that?

25:45.877 --> 25:46.878
Did he not get my bio?

25:46.962 --> 25:48.046
I don't know.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.464
Hello, Winchester!

25:51.132 --> 25:52.300
Ah.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.970
Wow. [laughs]

25:56.555 --> 25:57.764
Wow.

25:58.765 --> 26:00.308
Okay.

26:01.059 --> 26:02.060
This is good.

26:02.143 --> 26:03.144
Um...

26:04.062 --> 26:06.356
You all do know that Carson canceled,
right?

26:06.439 --> 26:07.941
I mean... [laughs]

26:08.024 --> 26:09.067
You weren't...

26:09.734 --> 26:11.194
Okay, you're here to see me.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.196
I think you will like the start
of my speech.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.322
[chuckles]

26:17.742 --> 26:20.787
So racism is not a myth,

26:21.621 --> 26:23.498
but, uh, when...

26:24.666 --> 26:27.877
racism was a real problem,

26:28.503 --> 26:31.715
liberals were the culprits.

26:32.507 --> 26:33.717
Did you know that?

26:35.302 --> 26:37.053
-It's only now...
-[phone vibrates]

26:37.137 --> 26:41.391
That the real issue facing
African-Americans

26:41.474 --> 26:43.977
are basically over.

26:44.060 --> 26:46.896
Um, that so-called social justice warriors

26:46.980 --> 26:49.941
use words like "institutionalized racism"

26:50.025 --> 26:51.234
to get votes.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.736
[feedback hums]

26:52.819 --> 26:54.237
Coco, what is this?

26:54.321 --> 26:56.072
You know this is
for ticketed guests only.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.032
We have security.

26:57.115 --> 26:59.159
Good thing we all have tickets.

26:59.242 --> 27:00.994
How? We sold out immediately.

27:01.077 --> 27:03.330
Yes, to the Black Caucus

27:03.413 --> 27:06.041
and every affinity group on campus.

27:06.583 --> 27:09.294
Someone must have given them
the faculty skip codes.

27:09.377 --> 27:11.921
Also, people thought I was you.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.132
So fuck you for tarnishing my brand--

27:14.215 --> 27:15.842
well, further.

27:19.804 --> 27:22.599
Is it weird this is turning me on?

27:22.682 --> 27:26.603
Nope. I'm recording it
for a repeat sesh later.

27:26.686 --> 27:30.398
[Rikki] I don't get the sense
that you've read my book.

27:32.442 --> 27:33.526
[giggling]

27:33.610 --> 27:35.195
[knock on door]

27:38.031 --> 27:39.032
Sam, you okay?

27:39.115 --> 27:40.867
I'm coming from a Dickensian mind-fuck.

27:40.950 --> 27:42.619
Please tell me you have something.

27:42.702 --> 27:43.995
Right this way.

27:45.955 --> 27:49.876
Damn, Lionel.
Did you also find the Zodiac killer?

27:49.959 --> 27:51.044
Possibly.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.546
Okay, the Knights of Elam.

27:53.630 --> 27:56.758
They were one of the first
secret societies at Winchester.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.259
They believed world stabilization

27:58.343 --> 28:00.887
could only be achieved when inferior races

28:00.970 --> 28:02.639
submitted to the superior one.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.599
Bored rich white people,
every goddamn time.

28:04.683 --> 28:08.561
Yeah, one of their founding members
was a pioneer in phrenology.

28:08.645 --> 28:09.771
Dr. Henry Adams.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.023
His lab was here.

28:12.107 --> 28:14.526
In the 1800s, Dr. Adams' belief

28:14.609 --> 28:16.444
in a superior white race took hold.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.864
The invention of whiteness helped justify
keeping freed slaves

28:19.989 --> 28:21.658
from joining the American citizenry.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.326
Though a few slipped through.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.537
Guns helped to keep the slaves in line.

28:25.620 --> 28:28.164
They didn't want them
to see black students  and get any ideas.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.542
Yeah, whiteness plus guns. America.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.627
[Lionel]  In the 1920s,
the Knights went underground

28:32.711 --> 28:34.796
as Irish and Italian students combined

28:34.879 --> 28:37.715
former slave quarters,
Armstrong and Parker,

28:37.799 --> 28:38.883
and made them home.

28:38.967 --> 28:39.968
[Sam] What?

28:40.051 --> 28:42.429
And this is Donald Hancock,
a Knight of Elam.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.681
[Sam] And founder of your old newspaper.

28:44.764 --> 28:47.517
I also have evidence that they met here
in the 1960s,

28:47.600 --> 28:51.521
but then they tore that down
and turned it into  Griffin Fountain.

29:01.489 --> 29:03.867
[Sam]  When the truth is suppressed,
it doesn't die.

29:03.950 --> 29:05.910
It just goes underground.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.871
What's that?

29:09.581 --> 29:11.207
It's something my dad used to say.

29:12.709 --> 29:15.044
Lionel, this is it.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.965
This is how we find reason
behind all the chaos.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.843
Which one of these is the meeting place?

29:21.926 --> 29:23.178
I don't know.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.930
I was just stating facts
that I discovered.

29:27.849 --> 29:28.933
Wait a minute.

29:35.482 --> 29:38.067
That's how this works, right?

29:38.151 --> 29:40.320
Well, actually, that's about the midpoint

29:40.403 --> 29:43.490
of the underground railroad tunnels
leading from A-P.

29:43.573 --> 29:45.450
And above it is...

29:46.785 --> 29:48.036
The bell tower.

29:51.372 --> 29:54.417
Yes! Slaves being clever and shit.

-Al is to be ignored.

30:14.312 --> 30:16.356
[Lionel laughing]

30:16.439 --> 30:18.107
Why is my heart beating so fast?

30:18.191 --> 30:21.569
Because we're about to find out
if a long-forgotten secret society

30:21.653 --> 30:22.737
of elite black people exists

30:22.821 --> 30:25.824
and whether we can join them
to save the campus and the world.

30:25.907 --> 30:28.243
I think it's because we ran.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.161
Come on, Lionel! Get excited.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.579
We both need a win.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.082

30:40.088 --> 30:42.215
What are we walking into? Huh?

30:42.298 --> 30:43.424
What if it's just a cult?

30:43.508 --> 30:45.552
Like hot yoga or New Hampshire?

30:45.677 --> 30:48.263
Or what if there's nothing there?

30:50.390 --> 30:51.891
