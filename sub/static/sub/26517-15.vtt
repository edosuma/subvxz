00:00.047 --> 00:01.480
Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:01.549 --> 00:04.834
Thank you. You are really
always there when I need someone.

00:04.859 --> 00:07.993
Nathaniel, what you just did
meant a lot to me, really.

00:10.231 --> 00:12.175
- You know, we should, uh...
- Yeah. I-I should get my stuff.

00:12.199 --> 00:13.799
You're choosing to stay in West Covina?

00:13.824 --> 00:15.148
Because I still care about you.

00:15.173 --> 00:17.164
But I still really care about you,

00:17.189 --> 00:19.656
- like, so much.
- Me, too.

00:20.140 --> 00:22.174
Rebecca and I, we're just friends again.

01:12.826 --> 01:16.061
That community theater thing
was just such a disaster.

01:16.130 --> 01:18.563
So humiliating. And it sucks because...

01:18.702 --> 01:20.759
I thought it would make me happy.

01:21.001 --> 01:23.001
What am I supposed to do now?

01:23.586 --> 01:24.748
No, I'm not asking you, butter.

01:24.773 --> 01:26.005
You're never any help.

01:27.759 --> 01:29.141
I talk to butter. It's a thing.

01:29.584 --> 01:32.285
Josh,
what do I do with my life?

01:32.736 --> 01:34.517
Seriously. I thought
I'd landed on something

01:34.550 --> 01:35.884
with community theater, and it's weird,

01:35.909 --> 01:38.290
because as frustrated
and confused as I am,

01:38.315 --> 01:39.681
I feel like I'm close to something.

01:39.706 --> 01:41.840
I just... I just need to
fight through the confusion

01:41.877 --> 01:43.509
and focus and not get distracted

01:43.534 --> 01:45.298
by the things that
normally blow me off course.

01:45.323 --> 01:46.945
Rebecca, I'm in love with you.

01:51.056 --> 01:52.151
What?

01:52.539 --> 01:54.032
I'm in love with you.

01:54.587 --> 01:56.289
I'm sorry, allow me to
shift my focus completely.

01:56.314 --> 01:57.847
Uh, hold on a second.

01:58.603 --> 01:59.536
What?

02:00.267 --> 02:02.362
- I'm in...
- No.

02:02.387 --> 02:04.721
I actually heard you. Um...

02:07.485 --> 02:08.929
- What?
- I've been feeling

02:08.954 --> 02:11.715
like this for a while now,
but I tried to push it aside

02:11.740 --> 02:13.609
because our history is complicated.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.486
But I can't keep it inside anymore.

02:15.946 --> 02:18.197
Rebecca, I saw you
almost kiss Nathaniel,

02:18.222 --> 02:19.381
and now I need to know.

02:19.406 --> 02:20.727
Is it him?

02:21.618 --> 02:22.849
Or do I have a chance?

02:23.422 --> 02:25.618
- Late.
- What?

02:26.002 --> 02:28.171
I am late for work. I'm late for work.

02:28.196 --> 02:30.212
And this is an important conversation,

02:30.237 --> 02:32.861
but I don't want to
rush it, so bye, now.

02:33.998 --> 02:35.664
It's Nathaniel, isn't it?

02:35.689 --> 02:37.236
It's him, isn't it?

02:45.751 --> 02:47.309
Oh, my God.

02:47.422 --> 02:50.431
- Oh, Julia, this view.
- Yeah?

02:50.456 --> 02:52.548
Oh, man. At my old firm, Uh-huh.

02:52.617 --> 02:54.303
The view was of an animal clinic,

02:54.328 --> 02:56.929
a body shop and an online
tuxedo rental place,

02:56.954 --> 02:59.588
- so this is amazing.
- Well, I'm glad you like it,

02:59.657 --> 03:01.457
because we are very
happy to have you here.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.115
I want you to meet the team. Guys.

03:03.271 --> 03:05.605
So, this is Lisa,
Melanie, Malcolm and Craig.

03:05.962 --> 03:07.463
Oh, hi. Wow.

03:07.532 --> 03:10.487
You are all super groomed.

03:10.512 --> 03:11.878
Just keeping it tight.

03:11.903 --> 03:13.636
I love it.

03:13.704 --> 03:15.271
Not a Tim in the bunch.

03:15.382 --> 03:17.216
Oh. Thanks, guys. I'll see you later.

03:17.241 --> 03:19.608
- Every single one of
them a superstar. - Oh.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.844
Okay, so we have some
documents for you to sign.

03:21.913 --> 03:24.246
- Okay.
- And, uh, once you're done signing them,

03:24.315 --> 03:25.981
I can, uh, take you to accounting

03:26.006 --> 03:27.673
and give you your signing bonus.

03:28.321 --> 03:30.953
Wait. Today?

03:31.158 --> 03:32.134
Yeah.

03:32.282 --> 03:34.123
Uh...

03:34.192 --> 03:37.126
I'm gonna get a check for $10,000 today?

03:37.151 --> 03:38.884
- Yes.
- Okay. Well, I just...

03:38.909 --> 03:41.674
I-I thought you would sprinkle
that bonus over a few weeks.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.032
Actually, you know what?

03:43.057 --> 03:44.168
It's such a small
amount that we could even

03:44.193 --> 03:45.259
give it to you in cash.

03:45.284 --> 03:48.686
- Sound good?
- Uh, sure.

03:49.111 --> 03:50.883
I love you. You are beautiful.

03:51.010 --> 03:52.119
Oh.

03:52.337 --> 03:53.970
Almost as beautiful as your suit.

03:55.580 --> 03:58.314
I love that suit.
Where did you get that?

03:58.339 --> 04:00.439
Oh, this? This is Fett Regoso Couture.

04:00.464 --> 04:01.530
I love them.

04:01.555 --> 04:03.088
I have one for every day of the week.

04:03.287 --> 04:05.487
It's the unofficial office uniform.

04:05.681 --> 04:08.212
Uniform. Okay. Cool.

04:08.237 --> 04:09.736
Oh, it makes us feel like a team.

04:09.761 --> 04:11.384
Like the Yankees or the Rockettes.

04:11.479 --> 04:13.212
Well, I like both those things.

04:13.237 --> 04:14.581
Just a little something that we do.

04:14.606 --> 04:16.309
We do. Yes. And I am we.

04:16.334 --> 04:18.367
And so all are we together.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.257
And so I will with the suits.

04:20.745 --> 04:21.728
Right?

04:27.578 --> 04:30.412
Hey, most beautiful wife in the world.

04:30.837 --> 04:31.947
Oh, hey.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.189
You're coming to my
workplace with compliments?

04:34.356 --> 04:35.789
Yeah, can I borrow your keys?

04:36.189 --> 04:37.663
Not because I lost mine,

04:37.688 --> 04:39.255
but because I like the sound they make

04:39.280 --> 04:40.413
when they jangle together.

04:40.438 --> 04:42.301
And I'm looking for
interesting sounds to sample

04:42.326 --> 04:44.693
for those SoundCloud hip-hop
songs I've been making.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.017
You lost your keys again.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.426
- Indeed, yes.
- Yeah.

04:47.676 --> 04:49.527
Uh, here, I made you an extra set.

04:50.306 --> 04:52.078
I actually made you four extra sets

04:52.103 --> 04:54.003
because, yeah, for next time.

04:54.115 --> 04:56.739
- There won't be a next time.
- I'll see you next time.

04:57.262 --> 04:59.208
Hey, sorry.

04:59.233 --> 05:00.498
No, don't worry. I handled it.

05:00.523 --> 05:02.757
I know you're not, like,
trying to stress me out.

05:02.782 --> 05:04.315
Oh, I would never do that.

05:04.340 --> 05:05.673
I know.

05:05.916 --> 05:07.449
Oh!

05:07.518 --> 05:09.551
Oh, man.

05:09.576 --> 05:10.942
- Uh-huh.
- Got your phone wet.

05:10.967 --> 05:12.833
- Yep.
- Sorry.

05:12.990 --> 05:15.024
Also, I needed your
phone to call an Uber.

05:15.707 --> 05:17.652
Yeah. That tracks.

05:17.677 --> 05:20.806
I hear you. You want me
to propose. I'm not ready.

05:20.831 --> 05:23.076
How much longer are we gonna
argue about this? Until I have

05:23.100 --> 05:24.500
something oval cut on my finger.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.978
Oh, my God. Why can't you

05:26.003 --> 05:27.436
just let me have this?

05:27.461 --> 05:29.661
I love you, I want us to
spend our lives together,

05:29.686 --> 05:31.686
and I've always dreamed
about being a bride.

05:31.867 --> 05:34.310
Right. And is this part of
what you always dreamed of?

05:34.378 --> 05:36.578
Bullying the person
you love into proposing?

05:36.851 --> 05:38.924
Yes. Isn't it magical?

05:38.949 --> 05:40.582
Say it's magical.

05:40.651 --> 05:43.385
You're going through a thing
that has nothing to do with me.

05:43.540 --> 05:45.367
And I don't want to
fight about it anymore.

05:45.843 --> 05:47.556
I'm going home to New York, Valencia.

05:47.976 --> 05:49.359
Are you coming with me?

05:57.157 --> 05:58.429
Fine.

06:01.038 --> 06:02.071
Get out.

06:02.096 --> 06:04.997
- Josh said what?
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:05.538 --> 06:06.786
I didn't know what to say.

06:06.811 --> 06:08.255
I mean, a few years
ago, I would have killed

06:08.279 --> 06:09.559
to hear him say that. Literally.

06:09.613 --> 06:10.957
I almost killed someone's
cat because of him.

06:10.981 --> 06:12.881
In fairness, he almost killed me

06:12.906 --> 06:14.439
by letting me fall into a carnival pit.

06:14.464 --> 06:16.152
Ugh, they have to
fill that carnival pit.

06:16.187 --> 06:17.553
I almost lost a nephew.

06:17.665 --> 06:19.632
Just makes it so hard
to love that carnival.

06:19.657 --> 06:21.490
But I do. I do love that carnival.

06:21.559 --> 06:23.559
Anyway, how do you feel about Josh now?

06:23.671 --> 06:25.304
Or Greg? Or Nathaniel?

06:25.373 --> 06:26.572
I honestly don't know.

06:26.597 --> 06:28.564
I just can't believe
this is still happening.

06:28.812 --> 06:31.467
It's-it's so painful and exhausting.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.046
Yeah, I get it. It sucks.

06:33.070 --> 06:34.903
You have three gorgeous
men to choose from.

06:35.016 --> 06:36.182
All of my matches on Tinder

06:36.207 --> 06:37.451
are grifters from the Czech Republic,

06:37.475 --> 06:39.875
but you're right. You
have a huge problem.

06:39.944 --> 06:41.643
Problem? What problem? Oh.

06:41.712 --> 06:43.278
I'm sorry. I've just been standing here

06:43.303 --> 06:44.724
waiting for a cinnamon raisin.

06:44.749 --> 06:47.316
Darryl, have you ever had to
make a really difficult decision

06:47.341 --> 06:48.894
and you didn't know what to do?

06:48.919 --> 06:51.754
Say there are three
equally viable options.

06:51.822 --> 06:54.757
Me? All the time. I struggle
a lot with decisions.

06:54.869 --> 06:56.335
So much so that I made a study

06:56.360 --> 06:58.394
about how to compare options.

06:58.820 --> 07:00.339
Yeah, I read books,

07:00.364 --> 07:03.098
listened to podcasts and TED Talks,

07:03.398 --> 07:04.744
and I have developed

07:04.769 --> 07:07.035
a very effective and foolproof system.

07:07.304 --> 07:08.180
It's hard to explain.

07:08.205 --> 07:09.781
It's easier if I show you.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.508
This is your system?

07:12.576 --> 07:14.109
This is just columns.

07:14.265 --> 07:16.553
Ooh. Columns. Ooh, that is good.

07:16.578 --> 07:18.190
I've been trying to come up with a name.

07:18.258 --> 07:19.458
Okay, let's look

07:19.483 --> 07:20.894
at the Nathaniel
column first. All right.

07:21.195 --> 07:23.013
We have "charming,

07:23.038 --> 07:25.459
"handsome, smart,

07:25.484 --> 07:27.833
chemistry off the charts." Yeah.

07:27.858 --> 07:31.093
"Amazing in the sack."
And now "evolved."

07:31.161 --> 07:32.471
I mean, really, he has the approval

07:32.496 --> 07:34.640
of the women in the county jail.

07:34.665 --> 07:37.433
That's impossible. They're
only so-so on Beyoncé.

07:38.484 --> 07:39.787
Okay.

07:39.812 --> 07:41.947
Maybe it is Nathaniel, right?

07:41.972 --> 07:43.439
Yeah, but look at the Josh column.

07:43.507 --> 07:44.751
"Affectionate, emotionally available,

07:44.775 --> 07:47.771
incredible bod,
understands my inner child."

07:47.796 --> 07:49.855
And now "evolved."

07:49.880 --> 07:51.613
And, of course, "amazing in the sack."

07:51.726 --> 07:55.162
Yeah. And, God, I mean,
if I ended up with Josh,

07:55.187 --> 07:57.499
that would make a certain
sense. I did move here for him.

07:58.055 --> 08:01.023
Maybe it is Josh.

08:01.134 --> 08:04.503
Maybe, but now let's mosey
our eyes over to the Greg list.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.505
- Mm.
- And we've got "forgiveness."

08:06.530 --> 08:08.248
Of course, since, Jesus-like,

08:08.273 --> 08:10.643
he forgave you for bopping his pop.

08:10.668 --> 08:12.000
- Oh, gross.
- You did it.

08:12.113 --> 08:13.546
- He just said it.
- Mm-hmm.

08:13.571 --> 08:15.838
And then you wrote "smart,
compassionate, funny,

08:15.906 --> 08:17.439
"foxy A.H., surprising

08:17.464 --> 08:19.652
and seems to understand
me in some profound way."

08:19.677 --> 08:21.477
Also, "amazing in the sack."

08:21.545 --> 08:23.843
- That seems to be a constant.
- Mm-hmm.

08:23.868 --> 08:25.704
Yes, I've been blessed
with gifted lovers.

08:25.816 --> 08:27.683
Well, to be fair, I've taught them well.

08:28.001 --> 08:31.770
Guys, maybe it is Greg.

08:32.653 --> 08:34.570
Maybe it is Nathaniel.

08:35.736 --> 08:37.068
Maybe it is Josh.

08:37.094 --> 08:40.140
Oh, my God. This is
just... This is terrible.

08:40.796 --> 08:42.741
I can't believe this is happening again

08:42.765 --> 08:44.195
and that I'm back in a... .

08:45.616 --> 08:46.945
Oh, God.

08:49.437 --> 08:51.531
I'm coming, I'm coming. I
wasn't ready. I wasn't ready.

I-I was figuring
something out in my head.

09:55.177 --> 09:57.311
Guys, my life is a disaster.

09:57.336 --> 09:59.470
And not just my love life.
It feels like everything.

09:59.539 --> 10:01.739
I-I can't go on like
this. What do I do?

10:04.510 --> 10:05.910
Huh, a FaceTime from David.

10:05.978 --> 10:07.378
That's Audra Levine's husband.

10:07.446 --> 10:08.579
Hmm.

10:08.648 --> 10:09.980
Yeah, hi, David.

10:10.049 --> 10:11.535
Rebecca, Audra needs your help.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.324
Audra Levine needs my help? Why?

10:13.349 --> 10:14.909
She abandoned me and the triplets.

10:15.021 --> 10:16.220
She went to Las Vegas

10:16.245 --> 10:17.422
last week for a bachelorette trip,

10:17.447 --> 10:18.513
and she hasn't come back.

10:18.902 --> 10:20.574
I need someone to bring her back,

10:20.599 --> 10:22.677
and I can't ask someone who's
actually a part of our lives

10:22.716 --> 10:24.377
or whose opinion matters at all.

10:24.402 --> 10:25.887
So will you help me?

10:25.996 --> 10:27.307
According to the credit card bill,

10:27.331 --> 10:29.433
she's still at the Casa Majestic Casino.

10:30.203 --> 10:32.811
Wow, this is terrible news. I mean,

10:32.836 --> 10:34.557
Audra Levine has abandoned

10:34.582 --> 10:37.506
her mature, adult life and holed up

10:37.531 --> 10:39.550
in an off-brand Vegas casino?

10:39.575 --> 10:41.075
Well, this is sad.

10:41.144 --> 10:43.043
- This is so sad.
- Rebecca, I...

10:43.112 --> 10:44.512
I can see you smiling.

10:44.537 --> 10:46.480
This is FaceTime. We're
on FaceTime. Sorry.

10:46.505 --> 10:49.460
Is there any chance that-that
you would go to Vegas

10:49.485 --> 10:51.218
a-and bring her back home?

10:51.287 --> 10:53.277
I know that
you're probably really busy

10:53.302 --> 10:54.488
and have way more important things

10:54.513 --> 10:55.668
- that you could be doing...
- Yeah.

10:55.693 --> 10:58.285
Yeah, I do have way
better things to be doing.

10:58.310 --> 11:00.310
I'm actually making a
very big decision now

11:00.335 --> 11:01.839
in my amazing life.

11:01.864 --> 11:03.230
Uh...

11:03.343 --> 11:04.909
But you know what?

11:04.978 --> 11:06.511
This is more important.

11:06.536 --> 11:07.754
So yes, David.

11:07.779 --> 11:10.638
I will go. You can
count on me, as always.

11:10.663 --> 11:12.497
Oh, good. Oh, thank you so much.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.838
Oh, boy. Well, I guess the

11:14.863 --> 11:16.738
- columns have to wait.
- What?

11:16.763 --> 11:18.430
No, the columns wait for no one.

11:18.463 --> 11:20.512
Ooh, that is a good slogan.

11:20.644 --> 11:23.144
Guys, you heard David. Audra needs me.

11:23.635 --> 11:25.535
Or you want to procrastinate
on your decision

11:25.560 --> 11:26.993
and see your frenemy at her lowest

11:27.018 --> 11:29.051
so you can feel superior
and rub it in a little.

11:29.871 --> 11:31.536
AJ, you're a damn bitch.

11:31.561 --> 11:33.293
Thank you.

11:34.173 --> 11:35.606
This counts as overtime.

11:35.631 --> 11:37.097
- Does it?
- Mm-hmm.

11:39.902 --> 11:42.465
Hector is like having a kid sometimes.

11:42.490 --> 11:45.163
It's like having a kid
before I have a kid.

11:45.318 --> 11:47.590
Other than the kid I gave
birth to, which doesn't count.

11:47.615 --> 11:49.137
At least you're married.

11:49.162 --> 11:51.823
Beth left town and didn't
even answer my ultimatum.

11:51.848 --> 11:53.301
I thought the whole
point of an ultimatum

11:53.326 --> 11:55.360
was trapping someone
into giving you an answer.

11:55.385 --> 11:57.774
- Mm...
- Good thing Paula's happy.

11:58.131 --> 11:59.597
I really am.

11:59.622 --> 12:01.088
Oh. I'm sorry.

12:01.113 --> 12:03.713
Mmm. But the people
at my firm are so nice.

12:04.238 --> 12:06.204
I mean, I thought they
were gonna be snooty

12:06.229 --> 12:07.561
and that I wouldn't fit in,

12:07.586 --> 12:10.120
but, you know, now
that I've been there...

12:10.233 --> 12:11.966
It's basically perfect.

12:12.034 --> 12:13.601
All I have to do is get me

12:13.626 --> 12:16.371
one of them suits, and
then I will be one of them.

12:16.396 --> 12:17.682
Mmm. I'm gonna see

12:17.707 --> 12:18.839
how much they cost.

12:18.864 --> 12:21.431
You know, they're
probably pretty expensive.

12:21.456 --> 12:22.722
Yeah. At least, like,

12:22.747 --> 12:24.388
three or four hundred...

12:24.413 --> 12:25.813
Oh, my God!

12:25.838 --> 12:29.927
The jacket alone is $8,000!

12:29.952 --> 12:31.252
Oh. Um...

12:31.363 --> 12:32.763
That's almost my whole bonus.

12:32.788 --> 12:34.900
And that money was supposed
to pay off our credit cards.

12:34.924 --> 12:36.991
And we need a new roof on the house.

12:37.422 --> 12:38.369
Oh, cool.

12:38.394 --> 12:39.760
So we're all kind of miserable.

12:39.785 --> 12:41.318
This will be a cool lunch.

12:41.766 --> 12:42.940
Hey, ladies. I'm sorry.

12:42.965 --> 12:44.309
I can't make lunch.
There's an emergency.

12:44.333 --> 12:45.666
I have to go save a life.

12:45.735 --> 12:47.375
Anyway, I just came
here to tell you that.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.499
Seems like a text.

12:48.524 --> 12:50.202
Also, sometimes you just
don't show up at all,

12:50.227 --> 12:51.560
which also would have been fine.

12:51.707 --> 12:53.118
Look, to be honest,
I have to go to Vegas,

12:53.142 --> 12:54.286
and I really don't want to go alone.

12:54.310 --> 12:55.590
Does anyone want to come with me?

12:57.747 --> 13:00.907
Let's see, babysit my
husband or go to Vegas?

13:01.065 --> 13:04.533
Let's see, get rejected
again or go to Vegas?

13:04.558 --> 13:06.264
Vegas? I can turn that ten grand

13:06.289 --> 13:08.722
into 50 Fett Regoso
suits and a new roof.

13:08.747 --> 13:09.613
- What?
- Nothing.

13:09.641 --> 13:11.094
Just being supportive. Let's go!

13:11.119 --> 13:13.119
- Yeah. Oh, my God. I'm so in.
- Oh, awesome. - Okay.

13:13.529 --> 13:16.310
Oh, um, we just can't go
to the Bellagio or the MGM.

13:16.335 --> 13:18.001
It's a... You know, it's a long story.

13:24.798 --> 13:26.798
Ah.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.575
Sir.

13:30.644 --> 13:33.478
Hey, buddy. I need you to stand down.

13:33.591 --> 13:35.791
- Literally what do you mean?
- You heard me.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.282
Stand down.

13:37.307 --> 13:40.442
This morning, I declared to
Rebecca that I care about her.

13:40.467 --> 13:41.897
I cared about her before you did.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.922
You cared about her at
the theater the other day,

13:44.034 --> 13:45.734
but before that, I cared about her,

13:45.759 --> 13:47.659
like when we moved in together.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.627
But before that, yes, it was you.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.216
But before that, we almost got married.

13:51.264 --> 13:54.098
And, yes, before that, you
guys kissed in the elevator,

13:54.167 --> 13:55.645
but before that, at
summer camp, it was me.

13:55.670 --> 13:59.008
So I say to you, sir... stand down.

13:59.033 --> 14:00.833
Oh. Huh.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.899
I'm not gonna do that.
That's not something people do.

14:04.054 --> 14:05.387
You made

14:05.412 --> 14:07.579
a declaration to Rebecca. I get it.

14:07.604 --> 14:09.304
You're talking to the
king of declarations.

14:09.329 --> 14:11.529
Look, if someone made a
supercut of all the times

14:11.554 --> 14:15.977
I declared my love to
Rebecca, it would be... long.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.022
Regardless, I can't...

14:18.047 --> 14:20.014
To use your parlance... Stand down,

14:20.039 --> 14:22.273
because honestly, I think Rebecca and I,

14:22.298 --> 14:25.532
some way, somehow, have
a chance to be together.

14:25.557 --> 14:28.677
Well, then, we have a problem,
because we clearly both believe

14:28.702 --> 14:30.352
that we're who she's meant to be with.

14:30.415 --> 14:34.050
One of has to be wrong.
One of us has to be...

14:34.850 --> 14:36.243
Josh?

14:37.344 --> 14:39.210
Did you just forget your name, buddy?

14:39.235 --> 14:41.168
What? Oh.

14:41.193 --> 14:42.860
My name's on that whiteboard.

14:43.405 --> 14:44.504
AJ?

14:44.699 --> 14:47.099
AJ, why is my name on that whiteboard?

14:47.387 --> 14:48.641
Uh...

14:49.964 --> 14:52.500
You have... detention.

14:52.869 --> 14:54.969
Nathaniel, your name's up there, too.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.663
Yeah, uh... No, I... Oh.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.899
- Uh...
- AJ?

15:06.640 --> 15:08.180
Greg?

15:08.205 --> 15:09.771
It's me, you and Greg?

15:09.796 --> 15:11.586
And it looks like she's really torn,

15:11.611 --> 15:14.279
like she doesn't even know
who she wants to be with.

15:14.340 --> 15:17.308
Oh. Huh.

15:17.471 --> 15:19.170
I don't like this.

15:19.195 --> 15:22.129

18:18.437 --> 18:19.569
- Hey.
- Mm. Mm-hmm?

18:19.638 --> 18:21.705
- Did I see pai gow on the floor?
- Mm-hmm.

18:21.774 --> 18:23.473
Because I'm actually here to see...

18:23.542 --> 18:24.941
Hi. We're with

18:25.010 --> 18:26.521
the Martinez bachelorette.
Is there any way

18:26.545 --> 18:27.644
we can change rooms?

18:27.669 --> 18:30.197
We came here to have a good time.
We brought Molly.

18:30.222 --> 18:33.116
Yeah, Molly's our friend,
and she brought drugs.

18:33.141 --> 18:36.008
But the woman next door to us
is really harshing our vibe.

18:36.165 --> 18:39.533
Yeah, she keeps yelling,
"Sheket bevakasha," at us

18:39.558 --> 18:41.758
and referring to herself
as an alpha bitch.

18:41.827 --> 18:44.127
That's our girl. Hey, what
room's the bitch in again?

18:44.196 --> 18:46.296
- 428.
- Room 428. Come on, let's go.

18:46.365 --> 18:49.099
Hey, it looks like they
have Caribbean stud.

18:49.124 --> 18:50.957
Interesting.

18:55.707 --> 18:58.108
Ugh. Rebecca Bunch.

18:58.580 --> 19:00.120
What are you doing here?

19:00.145 --> 19:01.378
David called me.

19:01.447 --> 19:03.447
- Uh, what?
- Mm-hmm.

19:03.978 --> 19:05.058
Oh. Hello.

19:05.126 --> 19:06.326
Okay, everyone.

19:06.351 --> 19:07.484
Oh. Someone's living large.

19:07.553 --> 19:09.197
Hey, living your best
life. It's very nice.

19:09.221 --> 19:11.087
- Nice.
- Yeah.

19:12.346 --> 19:13.467
David called you?

19:13.955 --> 19:15.054
Wow.

19:15.079 --> 19:16.275
He must really be desperate.

19:16.300 --> 19:17.733
You know what? He's concerned,

19:17.758 --> 19:18.689
because he needs you to come home,

19:18.714 --> 19:21.060
and your three children
need you to come home.

19:21.502 --> 19:23.095
What do you care?

19:23.705 --> 19:26.005
I mean, we've known each
other our whole lives.

19:26.030 --> 19:28.103
And I care about you in my own way.

19:28.128 --> 19:29.767
You're like an annoying family member.

19:29.815 --> 19:31.338
And then I told my friends
about your situation,

19:31.363 --> 19:33.096
and they selflessly agreed to come help.

19:33.121 --> 19:33.939
Exactly.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.572
Females helping females.

19:35.597 --> 19:37.525
And that's called sisterhood.

19:39.245 --> 19:41.245
Okay, fine.

19:41.610 --> 19:42.955
You win.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.838
I mean, there's nothing
keeping me in Las Vegas anyway.

19:46.863 --> 19:48.564
I just needed a little break.

19:48.636 --> 19:50.770
You've all done your
good deed for the day.

19:51.033 --> 19:53.033
I'm gonna go pack.

19:54.743 --> 19:57.853
Wow. That... worked.

19:58.267 --> 19:59.494
Yeah, it did.

19:59.519 --> 20:03.173
And now we can go
home, back to our lives.

20:03.198 --> 20:06.658
And the, uh... the choices
that come with those lives.

20:06.697 --> 20:09.097
Yeah, and it's-it's not like
we want to stay for a little bit

20:09.122 --> 20:11.992
and sit in on a few blackjack
hands or anything, right?

20:13.174 --> 20:15.775
What?

20:15.800 --> 20:17.100
She's gone.

20:17.125 --> 20:18.058
We got a runner.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.183
- Oh, no.
- So sad.

20:19.208 --> 20:20.808
We can't leave yet.

20:22.000 --> 20:28.074

20:31.314 --> 20:33.047
Oh, see? Look at that.

20:33.116 --> 20:34.260
Those two people are in love.

20:34.284 --> 20:35.828
I bet they don't have any issues with...

20:35.852 --> 20:37.185
commitment.

20:37.254 --> 20:38.386
Audra?!

20:38.498 --> 20:41.132
Oh, my God, stop following me.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.258
Oh, babe, who are these chicks?

20:43.326 --> 20:45.260
I'm not usually up for three-ways.

20:46.607 --> 20:48.407
But the redhead can stay.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.113
Audra, who is this guy?

20:51.790 --> 20:53.534
This is...

20:53.603 --> 20:55.570
Jesse.

20:55.639 --> 20:58.039
Can't spell "Jesus" without "Jesse."

20:58.108 --> 20:59.907
Yes, you... you can.

20:59.932 --> 21:01.966
He bought me a drink at
the bachelorette party,

21:01.991 --> 21:04.225
and now I'm moving to
Las Vegas to be with him.

21:05.607 --> 21:07.431
I mean, you get it.
You did the same thing.

21:07.456 --> 21:08.722
Pulling a Rebecca Bunch.

21:13.509 --> 21:15.033
How great is that pizza bianco?

21:15.058 --> 21:16.357
It was delicious.

21:16.426 --> 21:18.384
In fact, I would like
for you to refer to me

21:18.409 --> 21:19.884
as "Josh Bianco" from now on. Thank you.

21:19.909 --> 21:21.787
You took off all the
cheese and soaked up the oil

21:21.812 --> 21:23.089
with a paper towel and ate that.

21:23.246 --> 21:24.954
- It was a cheat day.
- Okay.

21:25.338 --> 21:28.087
Oh. This is concerning.

21:28.805 --> 21:31.606
Sir, I would like you to stand down.

21:32.213 --> 21:34.000
Hey, Josh. Uh, what?

21:34.025 --> 21:35.533
It has been brought to my attention

21:35.558 --> 21:37.533
that Rebecca is torn between
me, you and Nathaniel.

21:37.558 --> 21:38.924
He has agreed to stand down,

21:38.949 --> 21:40.650
and, sir, that is what I ask of you.

21:40.675 --> 21:41.814
Oh, this is tremendous.

21:41.839 --> 21:43.126
What are you talking about?

21:43.150 --> 21:46.551
Shall you or shan't you stand down?

21:46.663 --> 21:48.663
Serrano!

21:48.688 --> 21:51.267
Gonna need you to stand down, buddy.

21:52.290 --> 21:54.002
Oh, Josh is here.

21:54.027 --> 21:56.461
You know, I let my cable
and my Netflix lapse.

21:56.530 --> 21:58.029
Turns out I didn't need it.

21:58.098 --> 22:00.009
Don't enjoy it. I mean, it is enjoyable.

22:00.033 --> 22:02.267
Dude, what are you doing here?

22:02.335 --> 22:03.635
You said you were standing down.

22:03.660 --> 22:05.345
Well, so did you. You said
you were standing down.

22:05.370 --> 22:07.256
Well, I realized I couldn't
live without Rebecca.

22:07.384 --> 22:08.517
I realized that, too,

22:08.542 --> 22:10.608
and then I realized that
he needed to stand down.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.121
Wait, wait, wait. Someone
say "Stand down" again.

22:12.145 --> 22:13.278
- Stand down!
- No!

22:13.303 --> 22:15.014
Guys, I don't know what
you're talking about.

22:15.039 --> 22:16.768
Rebecca and I are over.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.226
She has no interest in me.

22:18.294 --> 22:21.653
He doesn't know about the whiteboard.

22:21.721 --> 22:23.521
Oh, we got to show him the whiteboard.

22:23.590 --> 22:24.734
Please show us the whiteboard.

22:24.758 --> 22:26.358
Does anyone know where
the whiteboard is?

22:29.787 --> 22:31.037
Follow me.

22:34.536 --> 22:37.048
Whoa. This is nuts.

22:37.681 --> 22:38.980
This is awful.

22:39.251 --> 22:41.583
- She's making lists?
- They're columns,

22:41.608 --> 22:42.885
and I'm gonna trademark columns.

22:42.909 --> 22:44.576
You're gonna trademark
the word "columns"

22:44.601 --> 22:46.501
or just the concept of columns?

22:46.526 --> 22:48.092
Oh. I don't know. I'm not sure.

22:48.248 --> 22:49.244
Okay.

22:49.269 --> 22:50.638
Well, you can erase my column.

22:50.828 --> 22:52.295
This is dumb. I'm out.

22:55.340 --> 22:57.340
He's standing down, then?

22:59.926 --> 23:01.092
Hey, Audra.

23:01.117 --> 23:02.771
You're pulling a Rebecca Bunch. Wow.

23:02.796 --> 23:05.063
May I talk to you for just a moment?

23:05.131 --> 23:06.409
Can you wait just a minute, Daddy?

23:06.433 --> 23:07.532
Daddy?

23:07.645 --> 23:10.879
Don't be late, or you'll get a spankin'.

23:10.904 --> 23:12.270
O... Kay.

23:12.339 --> 23:13.471
- Okay.
- Thank you.

23:14.908 --> 23:17.175
- Don't leave without me.
- Hey. Hi.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.899
You're using me as justification

23:18.924 --> 23:22.390
for abandoning your three
very, very tiny children?

23:22.415 --> 23:24.415
I'm just doing exactly what you did.

23:24.528 --> 23:25.694
- What?
- Yes. You know what?

23:25.719 --> 23:27.285
I've actually secretly admired you

23:27.310 --> 23:28.797
for it for a long time.

23:28.822 --> 23:30.961
You escaped our restrictive upbringing

23:30.986 --> 23:33.702
and started a cute business,
you have great friends,

23:33.727 --> 23:38.096
and have dated 9.6's despite
being solidly in the fives.

23:38.845 --> 23:40.842
And you're happy with
your choices, right?

23:41.648 --> 23:43.103
Uh...

23:44.871 --> 23:46.626
Yes?

23:46.651 --> 23:50.418
Well, then, thank you and
your friends or whatever,

23:50.443 --> 23:53.111
but I'm fine, and I actually have to go.

23:53.136 --> 23:55.036
Jesse's playing in a secret, backroom,

23:55.061 --> 23:56.765
high-stakes poker game.

23:56.790 --> 23:58.360
It's in something
called the Diamond Suite.

23:58.429 --> 24:02.097
And I have to be there with him
because I'm his good luck charm.

24:02.494 --> 24:04.366
He says he's gonna buy me a tiger.

24:04.391 --> 24:06.412
Okay, Audra. Audra!

24:06.437 --> 24:08.036
Audra, this is crazy.

24:08.259 --> 24:11.580
You can't call me crazy,
'cause when you call me crazy,

24:11.605 --> 24:14.440
you're just calling me in love. Blam!

24:16.280 --> 24:18.013
Ah... Don't-don't touch her.

24:20.573 --> 24:22.573
God, I just want to get in there.

24:22.686 --> 24:24.619
Mama needs some fancy suits.

24:24.688 --> 24:26.621
Oh, hey, cool text from Hector.

24:26.646 --> 24:28.126
"Which one is the smoke detector,

24:28.151 --> 24:29.991
"and which one is the
carbon monoxide detector?

24:30.016 --> 24:31.463
"Guess it doesn't matter.

24:31.488 --> 24:33.079
I set off both."

24:36.329 --> 24:37.899
Wait. I went to high school

24:37.924 --> 24:39.424
with that girl.

24:39.449 --> 24:41.903
Is that Denise Martinez?

24:41.972 --> 24:43.705
That bitch I cannot stand.

24:43.730 --> 24:45.163
Hey!

24:45.188 --> 24:47.322
- Hey!
- Hey... girl!

24:47.347 --> 24:48.946
- Hey!
- Hey!

24:50.837 --> 24:52.003
- Hey!
- Hey!

24:52.072 --> 24:53.805
Having yourself a little Vegas vaycay?

24:53.873 --> 24:54.939
Yeah. Kind of.

24:55.008 --> 24:56.248
Um, it's my bachelorette party.

24:56.276 --> 24:57.442
I'm getting married.

24:57.510 --> 24:58.710
Ah! Can you believe it?

25:00.213 --> 25:01.346
I can't.

25:01.414 --> 25:03.014
Yeah, he was really dragging his heels,

25:03.083 --> 25:05.817
so I gave him a deadline, and
he was afraid of losing me,

25:05.885 --> 25:08.453
so he forked over the diamond. Yay!

25:10.251 --> 25:11.499
Mm.

25:11.586 --> 25:13.953
Okay. Got to go. Bye.

25:16.298 --> 25:18.606
Hey, guys. We got to help
Audra. She's in trouble,

25:19.033 --> 25:20.775
and it's kind of because of me, so, uh,

25:20.800 --> 25:22.392
just let's go. Come on.

25:23.203 --> 25:25.770
She said it's some kind
of backroom poker game.

25:25.839 --> 25:28.106
Should we wait outside,
or should we knock?

25:28.174 --> 25:30.441
Oh. Oh, guys, guys, guys, guys,

25:30.510 --> 25:32.910
"backroom" is code for illegal.

25:33.023 --> 25:35.223
The stakes in these games are massive.

25:35.248 --> 25:37.630
I know this because
I-I saw a movie once.

25:37.655 --> 25:40.095
Listen, we got to get in there,
we got to double down on-on...

25:40.120 --> 25:41.719
on saving Audrey.

25:41.832 --> 25:43.098
- Audra.
- Yep. Her.

25:43.123 --> 25:45.001
Just... You know what?
Just point her out

25:45.026 --> 25:46.970
when we get in there.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.238
Who the hell are you?

25:50.263 --> 25:51.423
Hello, sir. We are here to see

25:51.464 --> 25:53.030
- a friend in the room.
- Shh. Get in here.

25:53.099 --> 25:54.766
What? What? What? What the... ?

25:54.834 --> 25:56.200
- Hey!
- Excuse me, sir.

25:56.269 --> 25:58.500
Do not handle me and my
friends in a rough manner!

25:58.525 --> 26:00.405
We're here to see Audra
Levine right there.

26:00.473 --> 26:01.672
Never seen her in my life.

26:01.785 --> 26:03.318
Okay, Audra, we can discuss this later,

26:03.343 --> 26:05.042
- but I got to get you out of here.
- Nope.

26:05.078 --> 26:06.322
Hey, hey, hey, you know what?

26:06.346 --> 26:07.945
I have an idea. Why don't all of you go,

26:08.014 --> 26:09.347
and take Audra's

26:09.416 --> 26:10.426
skeezeball boyfriend with you, and then

26:10.450 --> 26:11.549
I'll sit at the table

26:11.574 --> 26:13.073
while you all talk it out?

26:13.098 --> 26:14.998
What's the buy-in? What
game are we playing?

26:15.023 --> 26:16.564
The game is, you're coming with me.

26:16.589 --> 26:18.022
- Oh, come on.
- Hey. Let's go.

26:18.091 --> 26:20.236
- All right. Let's go.
- Right through there. You, too. Come on.

26:20.260 --> 26:21.426
- No!
- Yes. You, too.

26:21.494 --> 26:23.060
I don't care.

26:23.129 --> 26:24.362
Get inside. Shut up.

26:24.475 --> 26:26.174
Sit down and be quiet.

26:26.199 --> 26:27.732
Okay. We can't have you

26:27.757 --> 26:30.057
blabbing about this game
to anyone until it's over.

26:30.214 --> 26:32.147
If I hear a peep out of this room,

26:32.172 --> 26:34.697
that window's a nice way
to get to the sidewalk.

26:36.933 --> 26:38.633
The sidewalk? Wait.

26:39.065 --> 26:41.298
Guys, we're a bunch of stories up.

26:42.845 --> 26:45.527
I think he means throw us out the...

26:45.853 --> 26:47.095
Oh, that's what he means.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.053
You guys already...

26:50.751 --> 26:51.917
That's so scary.

26:57.533 --> 27:00.735
I hope Jesse's okay.

27:01.510 --> 27:04.778
He's hypoglycemic, and the
only thing that helps is sex.

27:05.814 --> 27:09.829
Audra, you know who this
guy really is, right?

27:09.854 --> 27:13.456
Yeah, honey, I mean, I know
he's got that sleazy, oily,

27:13.481 --> 27:15.800
shaved-all-over,
bad-boy charm, Ugh.

27:15.825 --> 27:16.587
But he's a loser.

27:16.612 --> 27:19.380
Jesse is not oily. He's
just naturally moist.

27:19.543 --> 27:21.009
And you're jealous.

27:21.034 --> 27:23.468
- All of you, you're all just jealous.
- Hey, lady.

27:23.493 --> 27:26.048
We all uprooted our lives
to come out here and save you

27:26.072 --> 27:27.872
and talk you out of child abandonment.

27:27.897 --> 27:29.497
Be a little more respectful.

27:29.522 --> 27:31.118
Yeah, we're basically heroes.

27:31.143 --> 27:32.877
- Dare to defy.
- Mm-hmm.

27:32.945 --> 27:36.947
Oh, please. You three
are not here for me.

27:37.016 --> 27:38.994
You're here because you're miserable

27:39.019 --> 27:41.189
and you're trying to avoid
your own miserable lives.

27:41.271 --> 27:42.497
- Who told you that?
- What do you know?

27:42.522 --> 27:43.454
Have you talked to Beth?

27:43.567 --> 27:44.966
You all just seem miserable.

27:44.991 --> 27:46.568
At least Rebecca here
kind of understands me.

27:46.592 --> 27:47.836
She knows, if you want to be happy,

27:47.860 --> 27:50.316
you gotta make these decisive choices.

27:50.341 --> 27:51.573
Right, Rebecca?

27:53.032 --> 27:55.432
Yeah. I mean, that-that's
what I do. Always.

27:55.501 --> 27:56.867
Shh.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.959
Hey.

27:58.984 --> 28:01.785
This loser went all in on a
marker and can't cover his bet.

28:01.810 --> 28:04.277
Oh, no, Jesse, what did you do?

28:04.302 --> 28:05.634
I had two high pairs.

28:05.777 --> 28:07.156
That's usually pretty good.

28:07.181 --> 28:08.322
Honey, help me.

28:08.347 --> 28:09.613
Bail me out here.

28:09.682 --> 28:11.603
I... love you?

28:13.150 --> 28:14.262
I can't.

28:14.790 --> 28:16.274
David put a lock

28:16.299 --> 28:18.766
on all my accounts, Daddy.

28:18.791 --> 28:21.425
Well, then tell that Jew
banker to just wire the money.

28:22.908 --> 28:26.043
- No way, man. - Uh-uh.
- You can't even think that. No.

28:26.068 --> 28:27.868
We're gonna need that
money back in the game,

28:27.893 --> 28:30.144
or this racist loser is
gonna hit the pavement

28:30.169 --> 28:31.435
through the window.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.770
Don't get confused, Jesse.

28:32.795 --> 28:34.306
We're a bunch of stories
up, so he's threatening

28:34.331 --> 28:35.942
- to throw you out the
window. I've checked. - Yeah.

28:36.008 --> 28:37.453
Rebecca, what about that statement

28:37.478 --> 28:38.753
- was confusing to you?
- No, no, no.

28:38.778 --> 28:40.455
- No, definitely out the window.
- I don't know.

28:40.479 --> 28:41.790
Sometimes, things are one story...

28:43.172 --> 28:44.906
Okay! Okay! No, no,
everyone just shut up!

28:45.017 --> 28:46.350
I got this.

28:46.619 --> 28:47.895
I got the money.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.253
I'm getting in the game.

28:49.278 --> 28:52.112
I'm making up Jesse's
money and then some.

28:52.341 --> 28:53.808
Let me see the money.

28:56.095 --> 28:59.220

30:24.141 --> 30:26.341
Are you really happy just being friends,

30:26.366 --> 30:27.658
or do you hold out hope

30:27.683 --> 30:29.580
maybe one day you'll get back together?

30:29.620 --> 30:32.724
Oh, no. No. We're-we're really
happy just being friends.

30:32.749 --> 30:35.083
Okay, good. Um, all right.

30:35.108 --> 30:36.874
Yeah, maybe that's what
I have with Rebecca.

30:36.899 --> 30:38.131
Oh, didn't let me finish.

30:38.156 --> 30:40.256
Uh, Darryl and I are
happy just being friends

30:40.281 --> 30:42.481
because we really ultimately
didn't work as a couple

30:42.538 --> 30:44.404
and we really are
happy with other people.

30:44.429 --> 30:45.551
But you and Rebecca seem different.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.827
Different, how?

30:47.852 --> 30:50.205
Oh, don't make me say it.

30:51.437 --> 30:53.638
Ugh, dude.

30:53.877 --> 30:56.236
I have known you for most of your life,

30:57.941 --> 31:00.341
and I've never seen
you as happy as you are

31:00.366 --> 31:01.697
when you're with Rebecca,

31:01.722 --> 31:04.256
even though I am truly, deeply

31:04.281 --> 31:05.480
perplexed as to how,

31:05.505 --> 31:07.004
not only you, but two other guys

31:07.029 --> 31:08.428
could be so into her.

31:08.453 --> 31:10.687
Truly, one of the great
puzzlements of the ages.

31:10.712 --> 31:13.046
But...

31:13.290 --> 31:14.823
Yeah. You, uh...

31:14.848 --> 31:17.282
you guys seem like you have
something special, so...

31:17.307 --> 31:19.830
I don't know. I think you
got to give that a shot.

31:20.392 --> 31:21.992
How do I do that?

31:25.022 --> 31:26.489
Well...

31:31.000 --> 31:33.333
Wow, Jesse was a real loser, I guess.

31:33.675 --> 31:36.092
Yeah. He-he is.

31:36.117 --> 31:37.816
I guess I kind of lost my mind.

31:38.354 --> 31:39.686
You know what? I'm actually embarrassed

31:39.711 --> 31:41.411
that you saw me like this.

31:42.178 --> 31:44.747
Especially you, who somehow,

31:44.772 --> 31:48.600
despite all the odds, have
your life together now.

31:48.625 --> 31:49.967
So, good job.

31:49.992 --> 31:51.691
Huh.

31:52.107 --> 31:55.207
Audra, I'm flattered

31:55.232 --> 31:58.032
that you've been inspired
by my life choices,

31:58.057 --> 32:00.157
and I know how you must see me,

32:00.182 --> 32:01.381
you know, as a hardworking

32:01.959 --> 32:04.249
and very decisive pretzel entrepreneur

32:04.274 --> 32:06.341
who has taken many a
lover out in West Covina.

32:06.453 --> 32:08.453
Yes, exactly. Yeah.

32:08.759 --> 32:10.381
It's not that easy.

32:10.843 --> 32:12.521
I struggle with making
decisions every day,

32:12.546 --> 32:14.913
and I probably will
for the rest of my life.

32:15.436 --> 32:18.930
I mean, I came to Vegas just
to avoid making a decision.

32:19.428 --> 32:21.055
You did?

32:21.990 --> 32:23.235
Let me ask you something.

32:23.260 --> 32:24.759
Did you run away

32:24.784 --> 32:27.952
because you really don't
love your husband and kids

32:27.977 --> 32:29.777
or because it just got hard?

32:32.259 --> 32:33.982
'Cause it got hard.

32:34.319 --> 32:36.753
I love my family,

32:36.778 --> 32:39.384
but triplets are rough, okay?

32:39.409 --> 32:40.708
And we're all alone.

32:40.733 --> 32:42.709
It's just me and David
and our three Au pairs.

32:43.750 --> 32:45.326
It's so much.

32:45.576 --> 32:48.010
There's always something
touching my breasts.

32:49.886 --> 32:52.436
- That sounds hard.
- Yeah.

32:52.461 --> 32:55.456
But something I learned from
moving across the country

32:55.481 --> 32:57.748
was not to just make rash decisions,

32:57.773 --> 33:00.273
but to face up to my life.

33:00.298 --> 33:02.999
And it's hard to do, but
if you do it, it's worth it.

33:04.227 --> 33:07.595
Well, you're a lot cooler
than I thought you were.

33:07.620 --> 33:09.353
Oh. Well, ditto.

33:09.378 --> 33:10.850
May I say

33:10.875 --> 33:13.442
it feels very good to have you
say something nice about me.

33:13.777 --> 33:15.843
Yeah. You know, actually,

33:15.868 --> 33:17.601
I could say a lot of
nice things about you.

Oh, my God, Rebecca,
your hands are so dry,

35:46.418 --> 35:48.085
it's like petting a lizard.

35:48.110 --> 35:49.637

Good-bye, Audra.

35:54.592 --> 35:56.358
Bye.

35:59.676 --> 36:02.209
Hi. Can I charge those
drinks to her room? Thank you.

36:02.762 --> 36:03.911
I think I have a solution.

36:03.936 --> 36:05.836
Something that involves none of you

36:05.861 --> 36:07.992
standing down.

36:08.017 --> 36:11.252
Sorry, that phrase is just so dumb.

36:11.277 --> 36:13.443
Uh, anyway, I got this idea.

36:13.468 --> 36:15.034
I was planted in front of my TV,

36:15.059 --> 36:17.326
which is what I sometimes do
when I'm doing my crunches.

36:17.351 --> 36:19.718
As you guys know, I
do a lot of crunches.

36:19.743 --> 36:21.375
I also do a lot of crunches.

36:22.431 --> 36:24.676
All right. I'll just
tell you what it is.

36:28.653 --> 36:31.184
♪

36:35.948 --> 36:37.815
Hey, hey. Hey.

36:37.883 --> 36:39.372
You are looking sharp.

36:39.403 --> 36:40.569
That is a nice suit.

36:40.622 --> 36:41.870
Thank you. Fett?

36:41.982 --> 36:43.682
Yeah. Feels great.

36:43.707 --> 36:44.973
I love it.

36:45.042 --> 36:47.075
Got it with the proceeds
of a backroom poker game.

36:47.144 --> 36:49.244
- Illegal?
- Allegedly.

36:49.313 --> 36:51.513
But, Julia, I have to tell you

36:51.538 --> 36:55.006
that this is the last one of
these suits that I will buy.

36:55.031 --> 36:58.666
Because, good Lord, even
if I could afford it... why?

36:58.822 --> 37:02.669
It's just jackets and
pants and skirts, and so...

37:03.856 --> 37:07.462
I'm sorry if I don't fit in,
but... I just can't do it.

37:07.575 --> 37:10.042
Paula, we do not care how you dress.

37:10.111 --> 37:11.377
That's not why we hired you.

37:11.402 --> 37:12.754
You are a brilliant legal mind.

37:12.779 --> 37:14.079
You just keep on doing that,

37:14.104 --> 37:15.904
and you're gonna fit in here just fine.

37:18.486 --> 37:19.985
Wow. Okay.

37:20.010 --> 37:21.209
Thank you.

37:21.278 --> 37:23.679
I just, you know, I just
wanted to fit in so badly,

37:23.704 --> 37:25.270
and so I thought I needed the suits,

37:25.295 --> 37:27.295
and I'm glad I don't.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.122
No.

37:28.130 --> 37:29.430
Oh, by the way, hot tip...

37:29.498 --> 37:32.399
They have some great
stuff at Dress Barn.

37:33.098 --> 37:34.902
It's a dress barn?

37:34.970 --> 37:37.871
Yeah. You know what?
It's not for you. I see that.

37:38.027 --> 37:41.118
- Probably not.
- Probably not.

37:41.458 --> 37:43.110
Hey, do you know where

37:43.179 --> 37:44.211
my gray hoodie is?

37:44.280 --> 37:45.779
It was in that pile of...

37:45.892 --> 37:47.892
one gray hoodie on the floor.

37:48.286 --> 37:50.461
Um, no, I don't.

37:50.856 --> 37:53.130
You are gonna have to
find that hoodie yourself.

37:54.044 --> 37:55.325
Hector,

37:55.350 --> 37:57.150
I am not your mommy.

37:57.175 --> 37:58.997
And you are not my daddy.

37:59.185 --> 38:00.551
I learned that in Vegas.

38:01.090 --> 38:03.337
We are partners in this marriage,

38:03.362 --> 38:04.862
and I need you to show up.

38:05.300 --> 38:07.233
Okay? We have to work together,

38:07.258 --> 38:10.726
or someday I might run off
to Vegas to be with a guy

38:10.751 --> 38:13.036
who's made multiple submission
tapes to The Real World.

38:13.061 --> 38:14.960
Okay. I get it.

38:15.866 --> 38:18.500
Uh, I guess I did that
because you picked up the slack

38:18.628 --> 38:19.730
and I liked it.

38:19.755 --> 38:21.755
But I won't do it again.

38:21.851 --> 38:23.217
Thank you.

38:23.269 --> 38:24.379
Great.

38:24.992 --> 38:26.892
So... gray hoodie.

38:27.578 --> 38:29.231
Sunset on it. No?

38:29.256 --> 38:31.489
- Mm. Mm-mm. Yep, no.
- No?

38:31.514 --> 38:33.309
Oh, I'll find it. Don't worry.

38:33.832 --> 38:35.861
It's just... left my keys in there.

38:35.886 --> 38:37.219
Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

38:38.094 --> 38:40.127
So, when I saw that Denise Martinez

38:40.152 --> 38:41.752
pressured someone into a proposal,

38:42.051 --> 38:44.028
I realized ultimatums are super basic,

38:44.053 --> 38:46.239
so I don't want to do them anymore.

38:46.423 --> 38:48.418
That's good... I guess.

38:48.443 --> 38:49.476
I love you.

38:49.637 --> 38:50.737
I hope you can forgive me.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.095
I forgive you.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.486
And, V, you know,

38:53.511 --> 38:55.311
I wasn't saying no to marriage forever.

38:55.573 --> 38:57.973
If, one day, you decide
you want to get down

38:57.998 --> 39:00.766
on one knee and give
me a nice square cut,

39:00.791 --> 39:03.625
ethically sourced
diamond, I might say yes.

39:03.734 --> 39:06.762
Wait. I can propose?

39:07.076 --> 39:09.777
♪ ♪

39:16.593 --> 39:17.859
Hey, Rebecca.

39:17.884 --> 39:18.662
Oh, hey, Darryl.

39:18.687 --> 39:20.936
You know, as great as this system is...

39:20.961 --> 39:22.894
And it is truly groundbreaking...

39:22.919 --> 39:24.518
I know what I need to do.

39:24.543 --> 39:25.709
I need to be an adult.

39:25.734 --> 39:27.934
And I need to have an open
and honest conversation

39:28.101 --> 39:29.303
with each of these guys

39:29.328 --> 39:32.229
and finally just make a
choice once and for all.

39:33.076 --> 39:34.586
It's funny you should say that,

39:34.611 --> 39:36.645
because I've been asked
to bring you somewhere.

39:39.350 --> 39:40.515
Wait. I think...

39:40.540 --> 39:42.173
You guys, there, there,
there, there. Hmm?

39:42.198 --> 39:43.897
Oh. Oh.

39:45.227 --> 39:47.227
Whoa.

39:47.252 --> 39:49.186
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:49.367 --> 39:50.800
I guess "sup" is the only greeting

39:50.825 --> 39:51.991
that hasn't been used yet.

39:52.199 --> 39:54.566
Look, Rebecca, this is, uh...

39:54.591 --> 39:56.436
Well, this is insane,
and I can't believe

39:56.461 --> 39:59.328
I'm forming these words,
but we've all agreed...

39:59.353 --> 40:03.388
W-W-We're proposing you go on
three dates with three guys.

40:04.912 --> 40:06.498
Nine dates?

40:07.191 --> 40:09.904
I mean, that's... that's
such a weird number.

40:09.929 --> 40:12.696
No, no, no. Uh, one
date with each of us,

40:12.721 --> 40:16.217
and then at the end of
that, you make your decision.

40:16.242 --> 40:17.441
Oh.

40:17.940 --> 40:20.123
Uh, if you're comfortable with the plan.

40:20.148 --> 40:21.748
Yeah. Only if it's okay with you.

40:22.463 --> 40:25.298
