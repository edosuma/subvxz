Yes. When your best friend gets dumped...

26:53.154 --> 26:54.610
All right, I'll leave.

26:57.492 --> 27:00.575
Well, look, would you just at least look in
the bag and see what I bought?

27:00.787 --> 27:03.199
You know, maybe you use it,
maybe you don't.

27:03.539 --> 27:04.528
Sound good?

27:22.266 --> 27:26.600
You think I'm gonna let you put these on
and chain me up like a dog?

27:28.523 --> 27:29.808
Actually, no.

27:32.485 --> 27:34.567
(GRUNTS) What the hell are you doing?

27:37.782 --> 27:41.240
Protecting you from yourself
and giving you some payback.

27:43.496 --> 27:45.361
For making out with Lydia.

27:52.296 --> 27:54.252
("PSYCHASTHENIA" PLAYING)

28:07.687 --> 28:11.771
Could you map this globe

28:15.319 --> 28:20.814
With a torment slowly rose?

28:22.118 --> 28:23.233
(CHUCKLES)

28:25.496 --> 28:26.872
What are you doing here?

28:27.707 --> 28:30.949
Oh, I was just thinking I might get back into
something I haven't done for a while.

28:31.544 --> 28:32.909
What about you?

28:33.171 --> 28:35.662
Oh, uh, for Danny.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.998
McCall bashed him pretty hard on the field.

28:41.429 --> 28:44.011
Why do | get the feeling
you could use someone to talk to?

28:46.100 --> 28:47.806
Is it that obvious?

28:48.477 --> 28:50.968
Maybe 'cause I'm kind of
feeling the same way.

28:55.443 --> 28:56.853
I brought you some water.

29:08.289 --> 29:10.029
SCOTT: I'm gonna kill you!

29:11.876 --> 29:13.582
You kissed her, Scott, okay?

29:13.794 --> 29:14.874
You kissed Lydia.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.669
That's, like, the one girl that I...

29:17.882 --> 29:19.338
And, you know,
the past three hours, I've been thinking,

29:19.550 --> 29:20.630
it's probably just the full moon,

29:20.843 --> 29:22.128
you know, he doesn't even
know what he's doing,

29:22.345 --> 29:23.960
and tomorrow,
he'll be totally back to normal.

29:24.180 --> 29:27.388
He probably won't even remember
what a complete dumbass he's been.

29:27.600 --> 29:32.310
A son of a bitch,
a freaking unbelievable piece of crap friend.

29:33.022 --> 29:34.637
She kissed me.

29:36.609 --> 29:37.940
What?

29:39.612 --> 29:41.227
I didn't kiss her.

29:42.573 --> 29:43.983
She kissed me.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.450
She would have done a lot more, too.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.988
You should have seen
the way she had her hands all over me.

29:52.416 --> 29:55.704
She would have done anything I wanted.

29:57.255 --> 29:58.586
Anything!

30:05.721 --> 30:08.337
(CLICKS TONGUE) If I tell you something,

30:09.016 --> 30:10.597
will you promise not to laugh?

30:10.810 --> 30:12.721
I would never laugh at you.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.434
I don't think it was Derek in the school.

30:21.612 --> 30:22.988
Neither do |.

(SCOTT GRUNTING)

30:36.002 --> 30:38.288
Stiles, please let me out.

30:39.797 --> 30:41.788
It's the full moon, I swear.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.336
You know I wouldn't
do any of this on purpose.

30:45.553 --> 30:47.259

30:53.769 --> 30:56.932
Please, Stiles, let me out.
It's starting to hurt.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.768
It's not like the first time.

31:01.902 --> 31:03.767
It's the full moon.

31:05.281 --> 31:06.737
It's Allison

31:07.992 --> 31:09.323
breaking up with me.

31:09.994 --> 31:11.154
I know

31:13.247 --> 31:15.954
that it's notjust taking a break.

31:18.461 --> 31:20.167
She broke up with me.

31:26.302 --> 31:28.133
And it's killing me.

31:30.056 --> 31:32.263
I feel completely hopeless.

31:35.019 --> 31:38.762
Just, please, let me out.

31:42.693 --> 31:44.024
I can't.

No, no, no!

(GRUNTING)

(SCREAMING)

32:11.097 --> 32:12.633
Is there something else?

32:14.433 --> 32:16.810
Okay, Allison,
just because you can't trust Scott,

32:17.019 --> 32:18.680
doesn't mean you can't trust anybody.

32:18.896 --> 32:21.387
But that's the thing.
There are people lying to me,

32:22.108 --> 32:23.848
people closer to me than Scott.

32:24.485 --> 32:25.850
Who?

32:28.322 --> 32:29.732
My father.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.065
And it's not like I don't realize

32:33.285 --> 32:35.776
we're not exactly
the most normal family on the block.

32:35.996 --> 32:40.160
Not every teenage girl comes home
to a garage full of Glocks and AK-47s.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.867
But, um...

32:46.257 --> 32:50.500
| just have this weird feeling like

32:51.178 --> 32:54.170
my dad knows more about
what happened in the school than we do.

Scott, are you okay?

33:52.072 --> 33:54.859
And I saw someone
standing in the hall, but...

33:55.075 --> 33:57.407
But, I mean, it might have
been Derek, but I couldn't see any features.

33:57.620 --> 33:59.076
It was...

33:59.580 --> 34:02.492
(SIGHS) It was just this kind of black shape.

34:11.634 --> 34:13.374
Here's where it gets really hard to explain.

The guy...

34:15.262 --> 34:18.129
Or whatever it was...

34:18.349 --> 34:21.591
ltjust got down on all fours,
and then just took off.

34:21.852 --> 34:23.888
On all fours, like hands and knees?

34:24.104 --> 34:26.231
No, like hands and feet.

34:26.982 --> 34:29.394
Like an animal. He moved like an animal.

(GROWLING)

34:44.375 --> 34:45.660
(ROARS)

34:50.506 --> 34:52.622
Well, then how do you know
it wasn't an animal?

34:53.217 --> 34:56.380
Because when he was standing up
he looked like a guy.

34:57.721 --> 34:59.052
Then what was it?

35:01.725 --> 35:02.840
What was that?
