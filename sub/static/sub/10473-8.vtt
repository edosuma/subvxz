00:35.680 --> 00:39.150
There we are. Well done, Norma.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.950
That's that bit done.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.590
Oh, look at him, Norma!

00:43.640 --> 00:45.990
When can Jim see him?

00:46.040 --> 00:49.110
When I go down the Pig And Gate
and fetch 'im.

00:49.160 --> 00:52.270
He'll not set foot over
this threshold until we're done.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.190
In't that right, Nurse? Absolutely!

00:55.240 --> 00:58.550
And then we'll be sending
that rotten old

00:58.600 --> 01:02.150
afterbirth down the allotment
with your granddad, won't we?

01:02.200 --> 01:04.269
Just the ticket
for his runner beans.

01:04.319 --> 01:06.870
'The arrival of new life
eclipses everything.'

01:06.920 --> 01:08.870
Won't we? Yeah!

01:08.920 --> 01:12.470
'When all goes well,
the room is filled with happiness

01:12.520 --> 01:15.870
'and all the pain that
went before is forgotten.

01:15.920 --> 01:18.830
'Where there was mystery,
there is knowledge.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.110
'Where there was fear,
there is love.'

01:21.160 --> 01:23.600
Just need to have another quick
look at you, Norma.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.710
That's bad...

01:27.760 --> 01:30.470
It's not ideal, Mrs Tunnidge.
But we will manage this.

01:30.520 --> 01:33.350
Norma! Stay with me, Norma.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.430
Mrs Tunnidge, put Baby in his cot
and keep him well wrapped up.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.990
Could you pass me the kidney dish
with the syringe, please?

01:39.040 --> 01:41.790
I'm going to give you an injection
to help stop the bleeding,

01:41.840 --> 01:43.910
and then I'm going to massage
your tummy to see

01:43.960 --> 01:45.950
if we can bring on another
contraction.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.390
What's happening?

01:47.440 --> 01:49.910
Part of the placenta
hasn't quite come away,

01:49.960 --> 01:52.110
so we need to give it some help.

01:52.160 --> 01:55.070
Could you ring a doctor,
and then an ambulance,

01:55.120 --> 01:58.430
then we need some hot water bottles,
to keep her warm till they arrive?

01:58.480 --> 02:00.550
Stay with me, Norma.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.550
There's something coming away.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.760
Good girl. That's it!

02:09.440 --> 02:11.150
Is it over?

02:11.200 --> 02:12.880
I hope so.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.120
Thanks, Nurse.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.280
It's all right.

02:37.160 --> 02:40.640
Oh, Nurse,
you've got something on your face.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.390
I can't believe what Mater's done.

03:17.440 --> 03:20.990
She's only gone and bally
discharged herself.

03:21.040 --> 03:24.750
She told the ward sister she was
checking into a private hotel,

03:24.800 --> 03:28.990
and any mail should be forwarded on
to a place called Pinehurst Lodge.

03:29.040 --> 03:32.030
So it's business as usual, really.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.080
Excuse me, I must change for work.
I've a long night ahead.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.760
Hello, dear.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.910
You've a choice
for your pudding tonight.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.550
I tried my hand
at an apple charlotte.

03:54.600 --> 03:58.070
Or there's cling peaches and evap,
if you want something lighter.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.680
It's up to you.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.510
I wish it was up to me.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.670
Because if it was,
I'd say apple charlotte.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.950
Mum's been in the kitchen making
it since you had your lunch.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.040
We'll have that, then.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.840
Apple charlotte it is.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.230
You've done wonderfully well
since arriving at the parish.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.270
The men's group meet
at my place once a week.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.270
Numbers have grown, and we're
going to have to meet elsewhere.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.720
Men's group? Whatever happens
in a men's group?

04:32.840 --> 04:37.230
Well, we discuss things
that are of interest to men.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.550
This time, we're talking
about pregnancy and birth.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.190
Oh, I-I-I think that
might perturb them.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.590
Well, if it does,
it shouldn't, surely?

04:44.640 --> 04:46.670
Fear often comes from ignorance.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.110
Mr Hereward, I couldn't agree more!

04:49.160 --> 04:52.350
I was actually hoping
I might get some of you on my side.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.950
Dr Turner's offered to talk us
through the nuts and bolts,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.470
but if one or two of the midwives
came along too,

04:57.520 --> 04:59.310
that would be even better.
And why is that?

04:59.360 --> 05:02.750
Well, I thought that they could put
over the female point of view.

05:02.800 --> 05:06.030
So much goes on behind closed
doors when a baby's born.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.630
I'll tell you what goes on
behind closed doors, Mr Hereward.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.990
A lot of hard work, that's what!

05:11.040 --> 05:15.190
No point in men discussing it.
It's a time for women to help women,

05:15.240 --> 05:16.510
and that is that.

05:16.560 --> 05:19.910
I think most men would be a much
better support to their wives

05:19.960 --> 05:22.400
if they at least had some
inkling of what was going on.

05:23.560 --> 05:26.030
I'd be happy to come along,
Mr Hereward.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.990
Thank you, Nurse Franklin.
Nurse Miller?

05:29.040 --> 05:31.710
Ooh, I'd absolutely love to,
but I'm on call.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.150
What about you, Patsy?

05:33.200 --> 05:34.870
Well, I've no objection.

05:34.920 --> 05:38.510
As long as I'm back in time
for Two-Way Family Favourites.

05:38.560 --> 05:42.750
Talks at the parish men's group
are the thin end of the wedge.

05:42.800 --> 05:47.070
If you hear a single remark
about men attending births,

05:47.120 --> 05:48.910
you are to report straight to me.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.550
Yes, Sister.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.830
The thing is, Nurse Mount,

05:51.880 --> 05:55.870
there's only so many people
can fit in a delivery room.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.030
And there is something special

05:58.080 --> 06:01.670
about a woman being supported by her
mother. The mother-daughter bond

06:01.720 --> 06:03.630
is a very precious thing.

06:17.600 --> 06:22.840
I deem compline a place of
succour for a soul in disarray.

06:28.280 --> 06:32.520
Though I must not press you to
join us, should you not desire it.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.320
I rather suspect I do desire it.

06:38.160 --> 06:42.270
I'm afraid I can't even think
of what to think just now.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.800
A conundrum that has ailed me much.

06:46.080 --> 06:50.310
But in chapel, we need not
choose our thoughts.

06:50.360 --> 06:56.080
The words are aligned,
like a rope for us to cling to.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.640
How long ago did your mother die?

07:11.240 --> 07:13.840
I think that is not
of any consequence.

07:16.080 --> 07:20.520
Dates, after all,
are only scratchings on a stone.

07:24.720 --> 07:28.680
♪ For thy loving kindness
is comfortable

07:31.160 --> 07:37.680
♪ Turn thee unto me according
to the multitude of thy mercies

07:39.480 --> 07:45.040
♪ And hide not thy face from thy
servant, for I am in trouble

07:47.760 --> 07:49.920
♪ Haste thee, and hear me

07:51.520 --> 07:56.680
♪ Thou hast known my reproof,
my shame, and my dishonour. ♪

08:13.640 --> 08:18.190
Morning, love. Cup of tea,
and into bed with this.

08:18.240 --> 08:21.430
Once you've had some kip,
you're going to visit your mother.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.150
Has she been in touch?

08:23.200 --> 08:24.870
No. But I tracked her down.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.990
It was Pinewood Villa,
not Pinehurst Lodge.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.190
It's a private nursing home,
and her fees are being paid

08:30.240 --> 08:33.230
by a charity called the
League For Distressed Gentlewomen.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.830
Charity? She doesn't
need charity, Peter.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.590
What sort of place is it?

08:38.640 --> 08:40.549
I draw your attention
to the cup of tea,

08:40.600 --> 08:42.830
hot water bottle and kip routine.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.360
Then you can go and find out.

08:55.960 --> 08:58.270
Begging your pardon, Sister,
but it's Sister Monica.

08:58.320 --> 09:01.870
I will not be brought before
the superior for a reprimand.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.910
I am in the novitian,
I am not in formation.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.350
Oh, no...

09:06.400 --> 09:09.430
She's really bad, Sister. I found
her halfway up the Commercial Road.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.520
Sister. Come inside, and warm
yourself. I don't know you.

09:18.720 --> 09:22.110
Nor do I know what you are
about in Sister Ada's office.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.630
Oh, my dear.
This is not Sister Ada's office.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.390
Sister Ada is no longer with us.
Now, then...

09:27.440 --> 09:29.110
Don't you "now, then" me.

09:29.160 --> 09:32.070
Thou art a peasant and a man,

09:32.120 --> 09:37.110
and as such no quarter should be
given to you within these walls.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.750
Should I go?

09:38.800 --> 09:40.200
No. No...

09:42.080 --> 09:47.120
Another man came once. I deemed him
a doctor, though he did not say.

09:48.520 --> 09:52.760
He asked me questions that I refused
to answer, lest I betray myself.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.760
My mother calls me stupid.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.200
Stupid...

10:08.040 --> 10:10.560
..and too tall.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.110
Fred. You'll find
the keys to the safe

10:15.160 --> 10:17.550
in the top left-hand drawer
of the chest.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.630
You'll find a package in there,

10:19.680 --> 10:22.640
marked "Property of
Miss Antonia Keville".

10:26.800 --> 10:29.760
I know that name.
Of course you do.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.800
I have seen these before.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.350
They were your mother's.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.870
And when she died -
a long, long time ago -

10:52.920 --> 10:55.600
she left them for you as a gift.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.080
These were her pearls.

11:08.840 --> 11:11.120
They are so cold.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.790
I know it's your favourite robe.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.150
The repair wasn't tricky.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.070
Did you use silk thread?

11:23.120 --> 11:26.120
No, rayon. I thought it would be
more durable.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.750
Now, don't fall off the bed
with excitement,

11:32.800 --> 11:35.870
but I brought you
a smidgeon of savoury mince.

11:35.920 --> 11:40.470
It's only what we had last night,
but as I said to Peter,

11:40.520 --> 11:43.710
"There's no harm in popping
some into a Tupperware!"

11:43.760 --> 11:45.120
What's Tupperware?

11:46.280 --> 11:47.840
It keeps food fresh.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.670
I wasn't sure what
the cuisine would be like.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.790
It can be quite variable...
Well, it isn't variable here.

11:54.840 --> 11:59.110
There's a baronet's widow
across the landing.

11:59.160 --> 12:01.800
It's in everyone's interests
to keep up standards.

12:04.400 --> 12:09.150
I'm still sure you'd be better
looked after in a hospital -

12:09.200 --> 12:10.760
where there's pain relief.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.600
I brought you
a photograph of Freddie.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.590
And one of Peter and I,
on our wedding day.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.990
I thought they might look
nice on your bedside table.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.920
I can't put that on display.

12:30.920 --> 12:36.720
Why not? You're not in white.
And he's wearing a lounge suit.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.590
One last thing.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.080
Peter sent you satsumas.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.390
But if they don't meet
with your approval,

12:46.440 --> 12:49.160
then you can pass them
on to the baronet's widow.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.750
Sister Julienne says
that if you eat a good lunch,

13:00.800 --> 13:04.520
she's happy for us to take care
of you, and won't send for Doctor.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.520
He could serve no purpose now.

13:16.240 --> 13:20.150
I have been reminded that...

13:20.200 --> 13:22.080
my mother is no more.

13:28.480 --> 13:31.040
Her jewellery is very beautiful.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.760
Our connection was never
affectionate...

13:40.800 --> 13:44.920
..and my call to the religious life
corrupted it completely.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.390
Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.550
Mrs Minter, we're about to begin.
I think, perhaps,

13:55.600 --> 13:58.320
if you could put your cigarette out
until we break for tea.

14:02.080 --> 14:06.070
As you will have gathered,
we're going to be taking a close look

14:06.120 --> 14:08.070
at our favourite piece
of Mozart tonight.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.750
I know it's far
and away the strongest thing

14:10.800 --> 14:14.510
in our repertoire, and for that very
reason, I've decided it will be

14:14.560 --> 14:18.790
our entry at the Truscott Choral
Festival at St Dacorum's Church.

14:18.840 --> 14:21.950
But that's only
a couple of weeks off!

14:22.000 --> 14:24.590
I know because my husband's
a painter and decorator.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.070
He's been brought in to
emulsion the chancel.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.480
From the very beginning, please,
Timothy.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.750
Oh.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.510
Can we help you?

14:41.560 --> 14:44.030
Sorry, but this is
the parish men's group.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.270
We're having the health
education session here.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.030
No, you are not!
But it's all been planned.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.430
I've everybody's name
written down on a list.

14:51.480 --> 14:52.910
There's clearly been an error.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.230
The choir has an
exclusive weekly booking,

14:55.280 --> 14:59.000
and we aren't due to finish
until nine. Again, please, Timothy.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.190
♪ Ave...Ave... ♪

15:15.640 --> 15:18.110
That would make things go
with a swing.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.110
The nuns will be in compline.

15:20.160 --> 15:23.630
Oh, do hurry up.
We're falling behind schedule!

15:23.680 --> 15:27.190
Ring the doorbell! Nobody bites!

15:27.240 --> 15:30.200
I bite...
if people don't wipe their feet.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.390
I'm going to read out
all the names on the list

15:34.440 --> 15:37.590
the reverend gave me, and I want
you all to call out "present" so

15:37.640 --> 15:40.270
I can tick you off. Colin Warneck?

15:40.320 --> 15:41.310
Present.

15:41.360 --> 15:42.910
Walter Mills? Present.

15:42.960 --> 15:46.550
Vernon Parker. Present.

15:46.600 --> 15:47.880
James Peachely?

15:49.400 --> 15:52.070
James Peachely, and Tony Muirhead?

15:52.120 --> 15:55.030
I think we may have lost them
to the Hand And Shears!

15:56.760 --> 15:59.710
I'm sorry.
I don't believe you're on my list.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.070
Should I be on a list?

16:01.120 --> 16:02.910
It's a requirement.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.200
Worth. Philip Worth.

16:06.320 --> 16:09.470
Thank you,
that all seems to be in order.

16:09.520 --> 16:14.470
Right, now, as you can see, I have
gone right back to square one.

16:14.520 --> 16:19.510
This circle represents the ova,
or the female egg,

16:19.560 --> 16:23.070
and this little chap here

16:23.120 --> 16:27.150
is the male gamete, or the sperm.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.110
Sorry, Dr T, I think
we've got a question.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.030
Where do I go to get
the milk of magnesia?

16:32.080 --> 16:34.310
What's the matter? Aren't you well?

16:34.360 --> 16:36.510
My cousin telephoned earlier.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.030
She's expecting, and
she's in agony with heartburn.

16:39.080 --> 16:42.870
The midwife said she could be given
an antacid, so I came to fetch it.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.840
I just walked in
with everybody else.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.480
Follow me.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.670
Ah, it's a good job you've
come back here, actually -

16:59.720 --> 17:00.950
it's going to be a busy night.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.230
I've just been called to
Mrs Boyle on Flitch Street.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.829
Oh, hello.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.390
Evening.

17:06.440 --> 17:09.230
I just had to rescue this poor
chap from a terrifying ordeal.

17:09.280 --> 17:13.030
Trial by the parish men's group.
And Patsy.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.069
Well, looks like he's lived
to tell the tale.

17:15.119 --> 17:17.310
There's no harm done.

17:17.359 --> 17:22.069
One bottle of milk of magnesia.
Nurse Lee will see you out.

17:22.119 --> 17:24.390
Heartburn can be a rotten business.

17:24.440 --> 17:27.430
Mind you, I've heard it means the
baby's going to have a lot of hair.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.510
I've heard that said
where we come from.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.910
Jeanette reckons
it's an old wives' tale.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.110
Whereabouts in Scotland are
you from? Edinburgh.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.880
I've just joined a barrister's
chambers at Lincoln's Inn.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.520
Thank you.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.440
Follow me.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.630
There's a nip in the air today.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.990
Are you sure you don't want me to go
to the cleaner's for your overcoat?

17:49.040 --> 17:54.480
I'm sure that... No. er, I'll take
a scarf. It's only a mild frost.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.680
Would you get the post?

18:04.800 --> 18:07.710
I'm just trying to show
you that I care.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.080
"Dr and Mrs P Turner."

18:15.240 --> 18:17.720
Tim, go and wait in the car.

18:30.200 --> 18:34.190
"After due consideration,
we are pleased to inform you that

18:34.240 --> 18:37.000
"you have been accepted
as adoptive parents..."

18:38.360 --> 18:39.750
"We have every confidence that

18:39.800 --> 18:43.270
"in due course you will be able
to offer an otherwise unwanted child

18:43.320 --> 18:45.200
"a very happy home."

18:47.720 --> 18:49.760
They seem very confident of that.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.030
What?

18:53.080 --> 18:55.880
The notion that
we have a happy home.

18:57.360 --> 19:00.040
At the moment,
I'm not sure that we do.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.630
This really is a beautiful room,
Mrs Heckford.

19:16.680 --> 19:21.680
Oh, thank you.
I like to put my stamp on a place.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.590
My husband and I have had to move
round a lot, because of his work.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.320
And what does your husband do?
He's a marine engineer.

19:30.080 --> 19:33.030
He's just been posted to
Gibraltar for three weeks.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.910
Does that mean you'll be alone
when the baby comes?

19:35.960 --> 19:38.470
Well, I've got my cousin
in residence.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.480
I daresay we can train him
to run errands and boil water.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.830
Any port in a storm.
There won't be a storm.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.510
You have a lovely home,

19:47.560 --> 19:52.070
and it feels to me as though
Baby's in the perfect position.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.510
Nicely lined up for delivery.
Is the head engaged?

19:54.560 --> 19:57.670
It is.
Have you been reading books?

19:57.720 --> 19:59.750
I've always been a reader.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.550
And a painter, too,
by the looks of it.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.030
Oh. That's my wee cousin's.

20:05.080 --> 20:07.550
He's currently inspired
by the music of Mussorgsky.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.510
I love Mussorgsky!

20:09.560 --> 20:13.190
I went to a concert of his music
at the Festival Hall last year.

20:13.240 --> 20:15.830
I just wish he'd been
inspired by something

20:15.880 --> 20:17.640
a little more comprehensible.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.790
I like it.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.200
Excellent.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.640
I will pass on the compliment.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.990
Lady Browne, if you can try and
drink this - please, try...

20:42.040 --> 20:43.870
I can't rest. What's happening?

20:43.920 --> 20:46.430
I beg your pardon.
Are you a relative?

20:46.480 --> 20:48.390
My wife's her daughter. I'm...

20:48.440 --> 20:52.030
I'm visiting on her behalf.
Is the doctor on his way?

20:52.080 --> 20:54.070
He isn't expected
until this evening.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.150
We aren't equipped to cope
with cases like this.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.510
Lady Browne needs to be in hospital.
Help me! Help.

20:58.560 --> 21:01.350
Hospital's the one place
where she doesn't want to be.

21:01.400 --> 21:04.240
Help me! Help. Help me.

21:08.040 --> 21:12.120
I'm sorry, your ladyship.
Where are we going? Home.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.030
What-oh, Mater!

21:27.080 --> 21:28.480
Lady Browne...?

21:31.160 --> 21:32.790
Lady Browne.

21:32.840 --> 21:35.990
She's been sick...
in the wastepaper bin.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.910
Well, better out than in.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.920
I'll take it and give it
a swill with some Dettol.

22:07.240 --> 22:09.270
I want her visited three times a day

22:09.320 --> 22:11.870
until a bed
at the London comes free.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.750
If she can't get up the stairs,

22:13.800 --> 22:16.110
she will have to be nursed
on the sofa in the meantime.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.190
Yes, Doctor.

22:17.240 --> 22:20.270
I will prescribe morphine in
liquid form, for her to take

22:20.320 --> 22:21.590
when necessary.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.470
I do know when I'm being discussed.

22:24.520 --> 22:26.910
Mater. Doctor's only trying to help.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.760
She's right, Nurse.

22:30.680 --> 22:34.120
Lady Browne, is there anything
you'd like to ask me?

22:37.680 --> 22:39.550
Have a sip of water, Lady Browne.

22:39.600 --> 22:42.200
You don't have to swallow,
just wet your lips.

22:51.280 --> 22:53.160
How long have I got?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.680
Weeks.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.320
Many? No.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.230
Days?

23:04.280 --> 23:06.280
It's impossible to say.

23:08.560 --> 23:15.360
I thought what was impossible to
say was the name of the disease.

23:16.840 --> 23:20.910
People say
"inflammation of the liver".

23:20.960 --> 23:24.200
Some people just call it
"the big C".

23:26.640 --> 23:28.510
Never its name.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.030
No.

23:30.080 --> 23:31.880
Why?

23:34.560 --> 23:39.270
Because it is the thing
that we fear the most.

23:39.320 --> 23:46.800
Fear is the sentiment
I don't hold with. Ask her.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.390
So.

23:51.440 --> 23:52.840
Cancer.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.640
The beast is named.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.760
It's unlikely we'll ever tame it.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.880
We can get it cornered...
for a while.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.840
Chummy? Will you help me
to organise some sheets?

24:17.280 --> 24:18.760
Roger, over and out.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.030
I can remember you sewing a
baby's nightdress in that chair.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.040
Yes. It wasn't to be.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.870
What did you do with it?

24:37.920 --> 24:39.470
I gave it to Sister Julienne.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.840
Someone else's baby will
have it now.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.160
I-I should have told
you about my breakdown.

24:55.880 --> 24:58.520
We started out in silence.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.200
Not able to speak.

25:04.040 --> 25:07.510
And after I dared to write to you,

25:07.560 --> 25:10.030
I thought, "Have I said too much?

25:10.080 --> 25:11.640
"Or not enough?"

25:14.880 --> 25:19.110
If I didn't speak of other things,
that was my weakness,

25:19.160 --> 25:23.710
and my fault and I can only beg
you to forgive me.

25:23.760 --> 25:26.120
I won't forgive you, Patrick.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.270
Because you did nothing wrong.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.830
I didn't speak
when I should've done.

25:31.880 --> 25:35.440
I didn't let you
when I should've done.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.720
But we're speaking now.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.600
Let that be the thing that matters.

25:51.280 --> 25:55.000
Sister Monica Joan, would you
like me to find your knitting bag?

25:56.320 --> 25:58.840
Or I could help you wind some wool,
perhaps.

26:02.080 --> 26:06.560
I find myself entirely
disinclined to knit.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.760
There are enough tangles
already in my mind.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.310
That's not true.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.880
They are warm now.

26:16.520 --> 26:21.240
And I fancy I detect my mother's
scent upon them.

26:28.480 --> 26:30.400
Sweet violet...

26:32.760 --> 26:37.520
..mingled with Wright's Coal Tar -
the latter from my hand.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.880
Oh, I wish we had
made our peace sooner.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.230
Your husband brought him down.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.400
He's in the kitchen making
a cup of tea.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.200
My husband does have a name, Mater.

27:27.840 --> 27:31.600
We're quite content with formal
terms. We have an arrangement.

27:33.560 --> 27:36.120
And furthermore,
I have come to a decision.

27:38.080 --> 27:40.630
Sister, I want to
talk to you about Lady Browne.

27:40.680 --> 27:44.590
A doctor called Cicely Saunders
has been exploring new ways

27:44.640 --> 27:47.030
of caring for people
who are terminally ill.

27:47.080 --> 27:50.230
She's based at St Joseph's Hospital
in Hackney, isn't she?

27:50.280 --> 27:52.120
It's a hospice, Sister.

27:53.720 --> 27:56.070
She advocates a different
kind of nursing.

27:56.120 --> 27:57.710
It's not like a hospital at all.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.950
The patient's family are
as important as the patient.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.150
Do you think we should approach
St Joseph's,

28:03.200 --> 28:05.150
and see if there's
a bed for Lady Browne?

28:05.200 --> 28:08.790
I tried, but the beds are full.
At least for now.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.310
It's such a shame!

28:10.360 --> 28:14.200
We should aim to give everyone
the chance of a good death.

28:16.800 --> 28:21.190
Sister Julienne, would you agree
to let me care for Lady Browne

28:21.240 --> 28:23.390
until she passes away?

28:23.440 --> 28:27.510
I'd like to implement some of
the principles of hospice care.

28:27.560 --> 28:29.630
You're a midwife, Nurse Lee.

28:29.680 --> 28:33.510
You were trained to bring life into
the world, not to help it to depart.

28:33.560 --> 28:36.510
But surely they're both
equally important?

28:36.560 --> 28:40.350
I've lost count of the number
of babies I've delivered, Sister,

28:40.400 --> 28:42.880
and this would be
something new for me.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.630
It's something
I feel very inspired by.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.710
I can see that.

28:48.760 --> 28:51.190
But if I were to take you away
from midwifery -

28:51.240 --> 28:53.110
possibly for weeks -

28:53.160 --> 28:56.350
the mothers and babies
of the district would suffer.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.950
But Lady Browne is suffering.
And Chummy is suffering.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.310
As it happens, Nurse Noakes
just telephoned to say that

29:02.360 --> 29:06.840
Lady Browne has chosen to stay at
home with her until the end comes.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.950
We will support them, and they
will support one another. Now,

29:13.000 --> 29:16.710
we have been asked to take on some
pupil midwives from the London

29:16.760 --> 29:20.070
for a day or two, whilst
their clinic is reorganised.

29:20.120 --> 29:23.440
I am putting you in charge
of the arrangements.

I haven't seen that the entire
time I've been at Nonnatus.

30:53.200 --> 30:57.720
Sister Monica Joan's at Chummy's all
the time, looking after Lady Browne.

30:59.120 --> 31:01.830
We've got extra Horlicks
to go with it, too.

31:01.880 --> 31:05.350
When I went upstairs, all
the pupil midwives were asleep.

31:05.400 --> 31:06.880
Set 'em up, Joe!

31:13.240 --> 31:15.960
One commode. All ship-shape
and Bristol fashion.

31:17.320 --> 31:18.990
Right.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.520
I think it will serve well
over there.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.160
Perfect!

31:29.520 --> 31:31.630
Would you like me to find you
a change of clothes?

31:31.680 --> 31:34.550
You might feel more on top
of things in a pair of slacks.

31:34.600 --> 31:36.920
I think not! I'm a nurse, old bean.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.680
This is my armour.

31:56.920 --> 32:00.190
The Plaza Suite is
open for business!

32:00.240 --> 32:03.320
You take your time, Lady Browne.
There's no rush.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
Once I'm up...

32:09.560 --> 32:12.350
..I'm up, I suppose.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.550
You'll have no reason to come down.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.880
We've got it all laid on
for you up there.

32:18.400 --> 32:21.560
Come on. Stairway To The Stars time.

32:25.720 --> 32:29.630
The choir are absolutely
note perfect on Ave Verum Corpus.

32:29.680 --> 32:32.150
The perfect choice
for the competition.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.430
They could sing it
standing on their heads.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.230
Might make it a bit more
interesting.

32:36.280 --> 32:40.030
This one is just addressed to you,
but it looks official.

32:40.080 --> 32:41.600
Is it about the baby?

32:49.160 --> 32:52.110
No. It's from the festival.

32:52.160 --> 32:55.750
The East Ham Singers are doing
Ave Verum Corpus.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.710
No two choirs can sing the same
piece, and they entered first,

32:58.760 --> 33:00.830
so we have to find another song.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.310
Great(!)

33:02.360 --> 33:04.000
By Saturday!

33:06.160 --> 33:10.550
That's a lovely, steady heartbeat.
And Baby's head's well down.

33:10.600 --> 33:13.430
But I can't see any signs that
labour's under way just yet,

33:13.480 --> 33:16.070
especially now those twinges
have petered out.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.950
I know it sounds silly, but I
was kind of in the mood for it!

33:21.040 --> 33:22.790
Thank you.

33:22.840 --> 33:25.830
Hello, Mr Heckford!
You're back from Gibraltar!

33:25.880 --> 33:28.830
Ha-ha! Bless you, Nurse.
This is my cousin, Philip.

33:28.880 --> 33:30.150
Would you like a coffee?

33:30.200 --> 33:31.870
Yes, please.

33:31.920 --> 33:35.230
Last time Nurse Lee was here,
she was admiring your painting.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.030
Really?

33:37.080 --> 33:39.080
Yes. I was.

33:44.640 --> 33:47.880
And I win. Again.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.670
This is a much better game
than bridge.

33:53.720 --> 33:55.720
What did you say it was called?

33:57.600 --> 33:59.710
Strip Jack Naked, your ladyship.

33:59.760 --> 34:05.800
You know, I shouldn't object if you
called me by my Christian name.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.639
Artemis?

34:10.040 --> 34:18.040
Ghastly, isn't it? Sir Rex
used to call me Arthur, sometimes.

34:20.199 --> 34:23.120
I think it was on account
of my large feet.

34:24.679 --> 34:26.560
I passed them on to Camilla.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.230
Had you ever noticed?

34:30.280 --> 34:32.960
I love Camilla's feet.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.159
Good.

34:37.280 --> 34:41.909
I will not be defeated by this.
The choir have worked too hard.

34:41.960 --> 34:45.110
If I find the right song,
they can sing it simply.

34:45.159 --> 34:48.800
I won't need to rehearse them
too hard. Puff, please.

34:50.239 --> 34:52.710
You can always have one of your own.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.679
No, because that would make
me a smoker.

35:02.280 --> 35:07.630
♪ May the good Lord bless

35:26.000 --> 35:31.200
I feel like the princess

35:35.000 --> 35:39.950
..floating up on layer upon
layer of mattresses.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.350
It's probably the morphine.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.800
It's the pillows.

36:04.240 --> 36:10.280
I used to have a manicure once
a week in Rajputan.

36:12.680 --> 36:18.310
We had Nivea cream
sent over by diplomatic bag.

36:22.400 --> 36:27.240
I wouldn't mind a manicure today.

36:29.200 --> 36:33.200
You don't want to bother with all
that fuss and nonsense.

36:40.120 --> 36:43.560
Did I ever read you
The Princess And The Pea?

36:46.760 --> 36:48.120
I'm not sure you did.

36:52.600 --> 36:57.680
Perhaps I sent it to you
at boarding school.

37:00.160 --> 37:06.390
The post in India was abominable.

37:06.440 --> 37:14.440
So much got lost...on the way.

37:21.080 --> 37:22.710
Mind the wet stairs now, Sister.

37:22.760 --> 37:24.830
Don't want you tripping
over on them.

37:24.880 --> 37:28.640
Out of my way. I am in search of
the most particular accoutrements.

37:30.400 --> 37:36.550
Oh, Nurse Franklin, such unseemly
quantities of intimate apparel.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.510
Sister Monica Joan?

37:38.560 --> 37:42.270
Instead of skulking outside this
chamber, I suggest you enter,

37:42.320 --> 37:46.510
and offer me your aid.
Is this Nivea?

37:46.560 --> 37:49.470
I don't know but I reckon
that's for putting on your face.

37:49.520 --> 37:52.320
I need Nivea. And nail paint.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.120
Is that what you're looking for?

37:58.960 --> 38:02.870
You are very slow to see what
is before you.

38:02.920 --> 38:05.640
I think you should consult
an oculist.

38:06.680 --> 38:08.990
I'm sorry to press-gang you
when you must be so busy.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.670
But if we can't swell the numbers
of the choir, I don't think

38:11.720 --> 38:14.590
the judges will even entertain such
a simple piece of music.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.070
I think it's a terrific choice.

38:16.120 --> 38:18.670
There's no reason why it has to be
a piece of classical music.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.870
Quite. But we need more voices.

38:20.920 --> 38:24.190
I want children, adults,
the elderly, all involved,

38:24.240 --> 38:27.040
and singing side by side.
I like the sound of that.

38:29.080 --> 38:31.630
Hello! Back again, like a bad penny.

38:31.680 --> 38:35.270
Not at all.
Jeanette hoped it would be you.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.030
M blank...

38:41.080 --> 38:46.950
G, N, I, blank, blank, blank, E,
blank, blank, second word,

38:47.000 --> 38:51.880
blank B, S, E, blank, S,
blank, O, blank.

38:53.840 --> 38:55.560
Is it Magnificent Obsession?

38:57.960 --> 39:00.550
Excellent! Full marks.

39:00.600 --> 39:04.800
Philip! That was the last clue.
Now what are we going to do?

39:08.480 --> 39:11.710
You could eat some of this toast
I just made.

39:11.760 --> 39:13.880
Or maybe not.

39:18.320 --> 39:21.880
I can't. I simply can't.

39:23.560 --> 39:27.230
It's just too frivolous
when there is so much else to do.

39:27.280 --> 39:32.840
But there's almost nothing else
to do. And little time.

39:39.320 --> 39:40.800
I'm sorry, Sister...

39:42.640 --> 39:44.360
But I can't...

39:46.600 --> 39:48.400
I can't touch her.

39:50.560 --> 39:54.320
Unless it's a nursing matter,
but even then...

39:57.360 --> 39:58.920
I'm sorry. But it's true.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.920
My mother and I
did not have a tactile union.

40:06.440 --> 40:09.870
I did not regret it
when she was alive.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.280
But now...

40:12.600 --> 40:16.550
I think of Keats and how he cried...

40:16.600 --> 40:19.190
Touch has a memory!

40:19.240 --> 40:21.270
O say, love, say

40:21.320 --> 40:23.390
What can I do to kill it

40:23.440 --> 40:25.280
And be free?

41:41.840 --> 41:43.640
You've never done that before.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.120
Oh, I have...

41:50.960 --> 41:55.680
When you were very, very tiny.

42:11.240 --> 42:13.600
I've been going at it
all night, Nurse.

42:14.760 --> 42:17.030
This baby is never going to come.

42:17.080 --> 42:19.230
Jeanette.

42:19.280 --> 42:23.990
Your contractions are coming every
five minutes, steadily and surely.

42:24.040 --> 42:26.520
Baby's coming steadily
and surely, too.

42:27.600 --> 42:30.710
I don't want it to come
steadily and surely.

42:30.760 --> 42:32.760
I want it now. Sssh.

42:34.280 --> 42:35.640
Or soon.

42:38.760 --> 42:43.440
Let's set our hopes on "soon".
"Soon" seems very reasonable to me.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.640
The tide is turning.

43:37.840 --> 43:43.830
Time to lay aside your uniform.
Today, you are her child.

43:43.880 --> 43:48.080
I'm still a nurse.
I know what that sound means.

43:59.040 --> 44:03.270
That's it.
Good, now stay calm, Jeanette.

44:03.320 --> 44:06.070
This is a good, strong contraction.
It will help you,

44:06.120 --> 44:09.160
and it will help your baby
make its way into the world.

44:14.160 --> 44:17.310
I can't face another night of this.
Ssh. Come on.

44:17.360 --> 44:22.070
I can't. How long have I got?

44:22.120 --> 44:24.310
Sorry, it's impossible to say.

44:29.800 --> 44:31.240
Tell me what to do.

44:33.480 --> 44:36.870
Telephone Nonnatus House, tell them
I've had a lady with

44:36.920 --> 44:40.120
a very, very long first stage
and we need gas and air.

44:44.080 --> 44:46.000
And a new midwife.

45:14.080 --> 45:15.830
They're here.

45:15.880 --> 45:18.950
Oh, look at you two.
Poor little chicks.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.630
Are you the father? He's the cousin.

45:20.680 --> 45:22.470
Out.

45:22.520 --> 45:25.390
Right, case notes,
and then get your mac on.

45:25.440 --> 45:26.870
I'm not a betting woman,

45:26.920 --> 45:29.590
but I'll wager five bob you just
need a bit of blood sugar.

45:29.640 --> 45:32.350
I don't suppose you could
force down a Creamline toffee?

45:32.400 --> 45:35.710
No enema, I see. And you wonder why
things have stalled.

45:35.760 --> 45:38.190
I told Nurse Lee I didn't want one...

45:38.240 --> 45:41.110
Don't worry. You might just find
we've packed the wrong kit.

45:41.160 --> 45:44.560
Off you pop. Get a bit of shuteye.

45:46.440 --> 45:49.750
Will you let me
walk you back to the convent?

45:49.800 --> 45:52.910
I know my way.
I'd know it blindfolded.

45:52.960 --> 45:54.760
Nurse Lee, are you upset?

45:56.720 --> 45:58.120
Um...

46:01.680 --> 46:06.710
I've delivered so many babies
and I've never once not managed.

46:06.760 --> 46:11.590
Never once failed to do what
I was trained for.

46:11.640 --> 46:14.470
If it was just tiredness, I'd know
tomorrow would be better but...

46:14.520 --> 46:16.320
Please. Let me walk you back.

46:19.160 --> 46:24.320
Thank you but there's somewhere
I need to go first.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.160
Put this on.

47:02.960 --> 47:04.480
It's Mater's.

48:54.960 --> 48:56.520
I love you.

49:03.840 --> 49:07.560
'The departure of life
eclipses everything.

49:08.920 --> 49:13.110
'When a death is good,
the room is filled with peace,

49:13.160 --> 49:18.110
'and all the pain that
went before it is forgotten.

49:18.160 --> 49:21.750
'Where there was mystery,
there is knowledge,

49:21.800 --> 49:24.720
'where there was fear,
there is love.'

49:29.320 --> 49:31.670
May I have everybody's attention.

49:31.720 --> 49:35.710
As you know, Timothy has had to go
back for his sheet music,

49:35.760 --> 49:38.630
which he forgot.
As soon as he arrives,

49:38.680 --> 49:42.110
we will be catching the bus to
St Dacorum's church.

49:42.160 --> 49:45.150
The fare will be sixpence each
way but if anyone

49:45.200 --> 49:49.320
is in difficulties, will they please
talk to me or Mr Hereward.

49:50.520 --> 49:54.950
At last!
I wondered what had kept you.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.200
It was the adoption agency.
There was a phone call.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.920
Thank you, Doctor. You're welcome.

50:07.160 --> 50:10.430
Patrick. The adoption agency
have a baby girl.

50:10.480 --> 50:12.710
They need us to go straight there.

50:12.760 --> 50:14.550
Well, how much have they told you?

50:14.600 --> 50:17.670
Hardly anything! Just that
the mother is only 16.

50:17.720 --> 50:20.190
She was meant to be taking
the baby home with her,

50:20.240 --> 50:23.030
but at the last minute her parents
have changed their minds.

50:23.080 --> 50:26.750
That's terrible. Tim. That's why
they want a speedy settlement.

50:26.800 --> 50:29.720
To spare further
trauma for those involved.

50:34.360 --> 50:35.950
Mrs Turner shows great faith in us.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.870
I can't even get them in a straight
line! Oi, stop that.

50:38.920 --> 50:40.270
This is a community choir,

50:40.320 --> 50:42.390
not a conga line
at the Hammersmith Palais!

50:42.440 --> 50:44.710
And if you don't keep up,

50:44.760 --> 50:47.670
my next weapon will be
the heel of my stiletto!

50:47.720 --> 50:49.120
Charming(!) Go on!

50:51.000 --> 50:54.710
Baby Jones is at the far
end of the room, on the right.

50:54.760 --> 50:59.350
There's a little felt sunflower
attached to her cot.

50:59.400 --> 51:02.680
Perhaps Master Turner would like
to wait in the office with me?

51:11.400 --> 51:13.430
Do you want to go in alone?

51:13.480 --> 51:15.350
No, Patrick.

51:15.400 --> 51:18.950
This is the closest I'm ever going
to get to giving birth.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.720
And I want, and I need,
you to be by my side.

51:58.120 --> 51:59.600
What's she like?

52:01.760 --> 52:03.280
Close your eyes.

52:27.160 --> 52:28.880
Here's your mummy.

52:40.560 --> 52:42.080

I don't think she'll even notice.

54:40.920 --> 54:43.550
She's been given
the prize of a lifetime today.

54:43.600 --> 54:45.390
The baby?

54:45.440 --> 54:47.750
It's just such a magical thought.

54:47.800 --> 54:52.080
These souls that have never met
being put together for a lifetime.

54:53.320 --> 54:56.270
That's quite a deep
thought for a Saturday evening.

54:56.320 --> 55:00.880
Well, it might surprise you to hear
this, but I'm quite a deep girl.

55:02.640 --> 55:03.920
I know.

55:16.640 --> 55:18.910
Why are we so low on
chloral hydrate?

55:18.960 --> 55:22.550
It's a sedative,
not a pre-labour cocktail snack.

55:22.600 --> 55:24.270
It should be administered sparingly!

55:24.320 --> 55:26.280
Sisters. And ladies...

55:27.840 --> 55:30.120
..Nurse Lee has some news for us.

55:34.080 --> 55:35.840
I've handed my notice in.

55:37.400 --> 55:39.000
Oh, I say!

55:40.360 --> 55:43.430
I'm moving away to take up
a position as a Staff Nurse

55:43.480 --> 55:46.470
at the Marie Curie Hospital.

55:46.520 --> 55:48.510
I want to work with the dying.

55:48.560 --> 55:51.240
And a cancer hospital
seems as good a place as any.

55:52.760 --> 55:54.910
Are you absolutely sure, Jenny?

55:54.960 --> 55:56.400
Yes.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
It's what I feel called to do.

56:06.120 --> 56:08.560
Right, Philip Worth, good luck.

56:09.920 --> 56:11.240
I...

56:13.360 --> 56:14.880
