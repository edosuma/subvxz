I'm sorry, Mom. I know I should have called,

I feel awful about all this.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.302
You think you feel bad?

13:31.378 --> 13:34.836
If I didn't open my big, fat,
stupid mouth about her boyfriend...

13:34.915 --> 13:37.975
then that little girl wouldn't be out there
with her heart broken.

13:38.052 --> 13:40.919
Don't anybody ever tell me
anything again!

13:45.259 --> 13:48.524
I love his passion.

13:48.596 --> 13:52.794
Poor Kyra. These things seem
like the end of the world at her age.

13:52.867 --> 13:56.200
Mom, she's 1 3. They would've
broken up in a week anyway.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.738
<i>Trust me. She's gonna be okay.</i>

13:58.806 --> 14:01.400
Well, I sure hope so.

14:01.475 --> 14:04.876
- But you-you're in big trouble.
- Me?

14:04.945 --> 14:07.607
Yeah. You just lost your safe date.

14:07.681 --> 14:10.844
<i>And at your age,</i>
<i>dating is a big numbers game...</i>

14:10.918 --> 14:15.378
and the pool of available men
is shrinkin' for you.

14:15.456 --> 14:18.186
It's not even a pool anymore, Ma.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.294
It's like a puddle.

14:23.864 --> 14:27.561
[ Chuckles ]
First off, thank you.

14:27.635 --> 14:30.798
And second, I'm done with Greg
and his lemonade.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.396
I've already caused enough trouble.

14:33.474 --> 14:36.341
- It's okay if you're scared.
- I'm not scared.

14:36.410 --> 14:40.574
No, it's okay. Think about it. The only guy
you've ever been with walked out on you.

14:40.648 --> 14:44.914
I'd be terrified if Van did that to me,
and my pool is still huge.

14:47.321 --> 14:50.916
Yeah, and you've got that baby
as man bait.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.653
Look, Mom, Kyra and Dylan are history...

14:53.727 --> 14:56.457
but you are still using them
as an excuse to hide from this guy.

14:56.530 --> 14:59.090
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

14:59.166 --> 15:03.865
There's nothing you can do about Kyra and Dylan,
but if you still wanna see Greg, you can.

15:03.938 --> 15:06.873
You're just gonna have to risk
getting hurt again.

15:06.941 --> 15:11.435
So to recap:
The puddle is small. Give him a call.

15:16.984 --> 15:20.283
I guess you're surprised
I gave you a call.

15:20.354 --> 15:23.551
Uh, I hate to admit it,
but it's a little awkward for me too.

15:23.624 --> 15:25.785
[ Slurping ]

15:25.860 --> 15:29.990
Ms. Hart,
I have soccer practice in an hour.

15:30.064 --> 15:31.998
I'll make it fast.

15:32.066 --> 15:36.560
Your dad and I are not gonna hang out anymore,
so you and Kyra can get back together.

15:36.637 --> 15:39.128
- Really?
- Yep.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.766
- Oh, hey, Kyra.
- Dylan. Hi.

15:41.842 --> 15:45.141
- Hey, honey.
- Your mom called.
She says it's cool if we get back together.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.840
Back together. You did that?

15:47.915 --> 15:51.043
Yep. And this time,
I'm gonna stay out of the way.

15:51.118 --> 15:54.815
- I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.
- So will I. One sec.

15:54.889 --> 15:57.221
One sec.

16:00.394 --> 16:04.660
- What are you doing?
- I fixed everything.
Dylan wants to go out with you.

16:04.732 --> 16:07.599
- Of course he does. I'm the one who dumped <i>him.</i>
- What?

16:07.668 --> 16:10.159
I don't like him anymore.
He's a huge crybaby.

16:10.237 --> 16:13.297
At first I thought he was sensitive,
but he cries at everything.

16:13.374 --> 16:15.865
He cries at the drop of a hat.
I mean literally.

16:15.943 --> 16:19.845
He dropped his hat
and burst into tears.

16:19.914 --> 16:23.213
But you told me you guys broke up
because of me and Greg.

16:23.284 --> 16:27.778
I lied. I just did that to scare you off so you
wouldn't get involved in my life anymore...

16:27.855 --> 16:31.347
which obviously worked like a charm.

16:31.425 --> 16:34.360
I'm your mother.
I will always get involved in your life.

16:34.428 --> 16:37.226
Good, because Dylan's out there,
and somebody has to break up with him.

16:37.298 --> 16:39.289
Be strong, Mom.

16:45.806 --> 16:48.366
Well, this is awkward.

16:53.447 --> 16:56.939
- Hey.
- Hey. Where's Kyra?

16:57.017 --> 16:59.850
Uh, Dylan.

17:01.322 --> 17:03.256
Hi.
[ Giggles ]

17:04.791 --> 17:08.284
Sometimes, Dylan,
things happen in life that are bad...

17:08.362 --> 17:12.458
but later you look back,
and they're still bad.

17:12.532 --> 17:16.230
<i>[ Laughs ]</i>
<i>But at least you're looking back.</i>

17:17.371 --> 17:21.000
- Are you breaking up with me?
- No. Um-

17:21.075 --> 17:23.066
You are.

17:23.143 --> 17:26.135
You're breaking up with me. Why?

17:27.381 --> 17:30.316
No, no, Dylan, it's not you.

17:30.384 --> 17:33.876
It's Kyra.
Think of this as a good thing.

17:33.954 --> 17:36.320
She's mean.

17:37.925 --> 17:41.622
I- I can't believe this.
[ Sobbing ]

17:44.999 --> 17:48.560
Okay, Dylan, look.
Honey, I know it's hard.

17:48.635 --> 17:51.297
[ Loud Crying, Blubbering ]

17:57.044 --> 18:00.946
- Hey, chief. I thought you had soccer.
- I'm not going.

18:02.516 --> 18:06.714
- What's with him?
- Dylan and Kyra broke up, again.

18:06.787 --> 18:10.188
- I'm sorry about this.
- Ah, poor kid.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.555
- Love's tough, huh?
- Yeah.

18:12.626 --> 18:16.118
In the long run, I'd rather he take
the risk and have his heart broken...

18:16.196 --> 18:20.189
than maybe miss out
on something great.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.498
You know, it's funny you mentioned that
'cause there's, uh-

18:23.570 --> 18:26.471
That gives me a chance to say something
that I think is kind of important.

18:26.540 --> 18:29.031
What is it?

18:31.812 --> 18:33.746
I'm allergic to lemonade.

18:33.814 --> 18:36.476
Really? I had other stuff.

18:36.550 --> 18:40.509
It's the weirdest thing. Ever since I was
a little kid- Do you wanna go out with me?

18:40.587 --> 18:42.817
Huh?

18:42.890 --> 18:45.859
I said ever since I was a little kid-
Do you wanna go out with me?

18:45.926 --> 18:48.451
'Cause it's a numbers thing, and it's-

18:48.529 --> 18:51.327
The puddle is small.

18:55.335 --> 18:58.327
- I'd love to go out with you.
- Whoo!

18:58.405 --> 19:02.307
I took a big chance there.
[ Sighs ] Scary.

19:02.376 --> 19:05.607
Glad that's over with.
I'm all sweaty.

19:07.714 --> 19:11.707
Well, I'm glad you did, 'cause I was afraid
I wasn't gonna see you anymore.

19:11.785 --> 19:14.049
Well, you could've asked me out.

19:14.121 --> 19:18.251
I know, but ever since Karen abandoned me,
I've had zero self-confidence.

19:18.325 --> 19:21.852
That's something
we can talk about over dinner.

19:21.929 --> 19:23.920
Where should we go?

19:23.997 --> 19:26.795
You know, now that we're dating...

19:26.867 --> 19:29.597
I feel like I can finally let this out.

19:29.670 --> 19:31.865
I'm so tired of being brave.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.339
Well, Chili's is nice.

19:45.085 --> 19:47.883
She hurt me so bad!

19:56.029 --> 19:59.328
Okay, let it out, big feller.

20:03.637 --> 20:06.128
Well, so much for being scared.

20:06.206 --> 20:09.232
- I asked him out, and he said yes.
- Score!

20:09.309 --> 20:14.246
Then he cried tears of joy
all over my favorite blouse.

20:14.314 --> 20:18.250
The dad cries too?
What a bunch of freaks!

20:18.318 --> 20:23.085
Yeah, it turns out men crying
is only attractive in theory.

20:24.191 --> 20:26.284
- Where are you going?
- To study.

20:26.360 --> 20:29.352
She met a new boy at school.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.900
Oh, no!

20:34.968 --> 20:37.766
I did it again! Why did she tell me?

20:37.838 --> 20:40.966
Damn this open, trusting face!

20:43.443 --> 20:46.935
Well, I hope this new kid's father
is u-u-gly!
