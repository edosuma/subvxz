00:13.629 --> 00:15.129
Hassan's security forces

00:15.197 --> 00:16.697
in the Islamic Republic

00:16.765 --> 00:17.965
are sweeping
through the capital,

00:18.033 --> 00:19.634
arreing opposition
leaders.

00:19.701 --> 00:23.271
And if he continues, it may
delegitimize the peace accord.

00:23.338 --> 00:25.306
<i>I can't vouch for you</i>

00:25.374 --> 00:26.941
as a reformer, Mr. President,

00:27.009 --> 00:28.409
if you renege

00:28.477 --> 00:30.077
on your human rights
obligations.

00:30.145 --> 00:32.313
My brother tried to kill me,

00:32.381 --> 00:33.981
helped by elements

00:34.049 --> 00:36.083
within my own government.

00:36.151 --> 00:37.652
Apparently,
killing President Hassan

00:37.719 --> 00:39.620
was only part
of his brother's plan.

00:39.688 --> 00:41.455
CTU now believes
he's also trying

00:41.523 --> 00:43.658
to acquire weapons-grade
uranium.

00:43.725 --> 00:45.660
When can I take possession
of the rods?

00:45.727 --> 00:47.662
As soon as we have the money.

00:47.729 --> 00:49.597
<i>JOSEF: I found a doctor
who can treat him.</i>

00:49.665 --> 00:51.132
BAZHAEV:
No doctors.

00:51.199 --> 00:53.100
The authorities know
about the nuclear material.

00:53.168 --> 00:54.368
Putting Oleg

00:54.436 --> 00:56.504
in a clinic would lead them
right to us.

00:56.571 --> 00:57.972
Dr. Levine.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.073
How did you get in here?

00:59.141 --> 01:00.908
My brother is sick.
I'm gonna call you

01:00.976 --> 01:02.443
an ambulance.
No.

01:02.511 --> 01:03.945
No one can know about this.

01:04.012 --> 01:06.681
(gasping):
No, no.

01:06.748 --> 01:08.282
What do you want from me?

01:08.350 --> 01:10.851
<i>You're a data analyst
for CTU.</i>

01:10.919 --> 01:13.020
You got access to all sorts
of good stuff.

01:13.088 --> 01:15.022
Yeah, but not unrestricted
access.

01:15.090 --> 01:17.124
Payout's got to be at least
six figures.

01:17.192 --> 01:18.492
You were undercover
for nearly two years

01:18.560 --> 01:19.961
with the Russian Mob.

01:20.028 --> 01:21.963
You're asking me to go back in?

01:22.030 --> 01:23.864
<i>Vladimir Laitanan was</i>

01:23.932 --> 01:25.533
completely obsessed with her.
It turned violent.

01:25.600 --> 01:26.667
Did he rape her?

01:26.735 --> 01:28.803
It looks like he tried
a couple of times.

01:28.870 --> 01:30.471
Can we talk
about this deal now?

01:30.539 --> 01:32.039
I wish it were that simple.

01:32.107 --> 01:33.507
Tie her up.
What?

01:33.575 --> 01:34.976
Look, you're making
a mistake.

01:35.043 --> 01:36.677
This is the chance
of a lifetimK]

01:36.745 --> 01:37.878
JACK:
This operation's over.

01:37.946 --> 01:39.880
Vladimir didn't take the bait.

01:39.948 --> 01:41.649
<i>Renee, it's Jack.</i>

01:41.717 --> 01:42.650
I know you can hear me.

01:42.718 --> 01:43.884
I'm on my way now.

01:43.952 --> 01:45.853
You don't want
to do this deal,

01:45.921 --> 01:47.488
then you might as well
just kill me,

01:47.556 --> 01:50.324
because this deal is
the only thing that I have.

01:50.392 --> 01:52.326
Do it!

01:52.394 --> 01:53.928
Pull the trigger!

01:56.665 --> 01:58.199
I had to be sure.

01:59.468 --> 02:00.901
CHLOE:
Jack, are you there?

02:00.969 --> 02:01.936
What's going on?

02:02.004 --> 02:03.404
She's in.

02:03.472 --> 02:04.805
They bought her cover.

02:30.499 --> 02:32.967
JACK (over comm):
Renee, I've got a visual on you.

02:33.035 --> 02:35.269
I'm going off comm
for a minute.

02:37.305 --> 02:40.141
You all right?

02:42.878 --> 02:44.412
(phone rings)

02:44.479 --> 02:45.646
CHLOE:
CTU, O'Brian.

02:45.714 --> 02:47.048
Chloe, it's Jack. I want you

02:47.115 --> 02:48.883
to monitor Renee's comm.
I need to speak to Hastings.

02:48.950 --> 02:50.051
Okay, I'll put you
through.

02:50.118 --> 02:51.085
I'm here, Jack. Go ahead.

02:51.153 --> 02:52.219
We need to pull
Renee Walker out now.

02:52.287 --> 02:53.587
Based on what?

02:53.655 --> 02:55.423
Because she's a danger
to herself and this mission.

02:55.490 --> 02:57.825
Ten minutes ago, Laitanan
threatened to execute her,

02:57.893 --> 02:58.926
and she said
she was sick of living

02:58.994 --> 03:00.161
and wanted to die
and she meant it.

03:00.228 --> 03:01.395
She must've been
playing him.

03:01.463 --> 03:03.064
No. She doesn't care
what happens to her,

03:03.131 --> 03:04.565
that's what makes
her dangerous.

03:04.633 --> 03:06.233
She's like a bomb
ready to go off.

03:06.301 --> 03:08.636
We need to get her out of there
before that happens. Look, I understand

03:08.703 --> 03:10.604
your concern, but we can't
just roll up this operation

03:10.672 --> 03:12.406
before we find those
nuclear rods.

03:12.474 --> 03:13.541
We can arrest Laitanan.

03:13.608 --> 03:14.809
If he knows how
to find the rods,

03:14.876 --> 03:16.077
I will make him talk.

03:16.144 --> 03:17.445
If you're saying
what I think you are,

03:17.512 --> 03:18.879
we don't do that anymore.

03:18.947 --> 03:20.748
Then you people do
what you do well-

03:20.816 --> 03:22.249
offer him immunity
or something.

03:22.317 --> 03:23.918
This is the Russian
Syndicate.

03:23.985 --> 03:26.187
They're very secretive,
they protect their own.

03:26.254 --> 03:27.755
It is highly unlikely

03:27.823 --> 03:28.989
that Laitanan would
cooperate.

03:29.057 --> 03:30.224
Then you better find
another way,

03:30.292 --> 03:31.859
because I am not gonna
let Renee die

03:31.927 --> 03:33.194
because CTU did
their job badly.

03:33.261 --> 03:35.196
I will not let that happen.
Do you understand me?

03:35.263 --> 03:37.198
Jack, if you can think
of something, I will listen.

03:37.265 --> 03:38.532
But right now,

03:38.600 --> 03:40.201
Renee's the only hope we have

03:40.268 --> 03:41.535
of neutralizing this threat.

03:41.603 --> 03:44.805
And on my order,
she stays in play.

03:47.242 --> 03:49.243
Jack?

03:50.912 --> 03:53.447
I'll find a way to get her out
when I go in as the buyer.

03:53.515 --> 03:56.450
I'll sy under in her place.

03:56.518 --> 03:58.452
Do we have a deal?

03:58.520 --> 04:00.955
As long as you can do it
without risking the mission.

04:01.022 --> 04:02.957
I give you my word.

04:03.024 --> 04:04.792
Agent Ortiz will meet you

04:04.860 --> 04:06.794
at the staging area
with a TAC team.

04:06.862 --> 04:09.163
He'll have everything you need
for your cover.

04:09.231 --> 04:10.498
Hold on.
They're moving.

04:10.565 --> 04:12.133
I need to get
back on comm.

04:14.169 --> 04:16.103
VLADIMIR:
We'll go back to my shop,

04:16.171 --> 04:19.173
and we will discuss
this buyer of yours.

04:30.752 --> 04:32.753
(engine starts)

04:38.527 --> 04:41.128
(tires squealing)

04:41.196 --> 04:42.997
HASTINGS: Dana... (gasps)

04:43.064 --> 04:44.665
start forwarding mission

04:44.733 --> 04:47.668
status reports to the Nuclear
Emergency Team at Fort Hamilton.

04:47.736 --> 04:50.137
I want them ready to go
in as soon as we find

04:50.205 --> 04:52.206
these nuclear rods.
I'm on it, sir.

05:15.397 --> 05:18.299
(phone rings)

05:18.366 --> 05:19.900
Ye.

05:19.968 --> 05:21.068
It's me.

05:21.136 --> 05:22.236
I've got something.

05:22.304 --> 05:23.904
Damn, you're fast.

05:23.972 --> 05:25.873
Okay, hold on.

05:25.941 --> 05:27.875
Okay, go.

05:27.943 --> 05:29.510
Let's hear it.

05:29.578 --> 05:31.378
It's an NYPD evidence lockup.

05:31.446 --> 05:34.582
According to the manifest,
a local vice group

05:34.649 --> 05:37.585
just impounded a stash
of drug money.

05:37.652 --> 05:39.753
It'll be held there
for the next 48 hours.

05:39.821 --> 05:41.188
How much?

05:41.256 --> 05:42.590
$120,000.

05:45.060 --> 05:46.660
All right, what's the plan?

05:46.728 --> 05:48.095
You go in and take it.

05:50.131 --> 05:51.398
(chuckles)

05:51.466 --> 05:53.000
What do you mean,
break into a police station?

05:53.068 --> 05:54.435
What, are you out of your mind?

05:54.502 --> 05:55.836
It's not a police station.
It's a warehouse.

05:55.904 --> 05:57.838
Most of the security
is automated.

05:57.906 --> 05:59.506
I can manipulate it
from here.

05:59.574 --> 06:01.508
You walk in, you walk out
with the cash.

06:01.576 --> 06:03.410
I'll talk you through it.

06:03.478 --> 06:06.614
I need to access
their security codes,

06:06.681 --> 06:08.816
work up a keycard to get you
inside the warehouse.

06:08.883 --> 06:10.017
How long?

06:10.085 --> 06:12.219
Meet me outside CTU
in 30 minutes.

06:12.287 --> 06:14.221
ARLO: Did you take care
of your situation?

06:14.289 --> 06:15.923
Situation?

06:15.991 --> 06:18.292
The big mystery you had
to leave work for.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.294
Oh, yeah, it's fine.

06:20.362 --> 06:22.229
What do you need, Arlo?

06:22.297 --> 06:25.065
I'm getting five percent lag
in my Drone's ABS controls.

06:25.133 --> 06:27.434
With everything going on,
I think I'm just running hot.

06:27.502 --> 06:30.104
Okay, I'll make sure
to free up some memory space

06:30.171 --> 06:32.439
on the auxiliary servers.

06:32.507 --> 06:34.108
Thanks.

06:34.175 --> 06:36.110
You know, if there's
something bothering you,

06:36.177 --> 06:38.279
you've always got
my shoulder to cry on.

06:38.346 --> 06:41.115
Or any other body part.

06:41.182 --> 06:42.650
I will keep that in mind.

06:42.717 --> 06:44.385
But, for now,
why don't you focus on

06:44.452 --> 06:45.986
running aerial support
for Walker and Bauer?

06:46.054 --> 06:47.454
Okay.

07:15.450 --> 07:17.851
âª âª

07:18.887 --> 07:21.255
Lugo, take a break.

07:21.323 --> 07:23.057
I want to talk to her alone.

07:34.602 --> 07:36.603
All right,
you have my attention.

07:37.872 --> 07:39.840
Tell me about this buyer.

07:39.908 --> 07:42.543
His name's
Ernst Meier.

07:42.610 --> 07:44.545
German arms dealer.

07:44.612 --> 07:46.447
Never heard of him.
He does most

07:46.514 --> 07:47.948
of his business in Asia;
he just started

07:48.016 --> 07:49.183
branching out
into North America.

07:49.250 --> 07:50.384
What's he looking to buy?

07:50.452 --> 07:52.152
Weapons-grade uranium.

07:54.189 --> 07:56.323
You're serious.

07:56.391 --> 07:57.624
Very.

07:57.692 --> 08:00.694
Someone in the Russian
Syndicate smuggled nuclear

08:00.762 --> 08:02.529
fuel rods out of the Ukraine.

08:02.597 --> 08:04.198
They're planning on selling them
on the open market.

08:06.234 --> 08:09.303
I... I have no idea
what you're talking about.

08:09.371 --> 08:11.305
I don't, Renee.

08:11.373 --> 08:12.873
But you can find out.

08:12.941 --> 08:15.876
You're very well
connected.

08:15.944 --> 08:19.413
I have always admired
your ambition,

08:19.481 --> 08:21.415
but you're chasing
the devil.

08:21.483 --> 08:22.916
Dealing AK-47s-

08:22.984 --> 08:24.918
no one really cares.

08:24.986 --> 08:27.888
But nuclear material?

08:27.956 --> 08:30.290
But the profit is worth it.

08:32.327 --> 08:35.028
You need money, huh?

08:35.096 --> 08:37.063
You can always
come work for me.

08:37.131 --> 08:40.433
No, I'm doing this so I don't
ever have to work for anyone.

08:41.469 --> 08:43.370
Have a seat.

08:43.438 --> 08:45.739
If I could find out...

08:46.775 --> 08:49.143
...what would it be worth?

08:50.178 --> 08:52.413
30% of the deal.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.014
I don't have
to tell you,

08:54.082 --> 08:55.883
that is more money than
you could possibly know

08:55.950 --> 08:58.252
what to do with.

08:58.319 --> 09:01.922
Look, Meier says these rods
are going to be sold soon,

09:01.990 --> 09:03.524
so if we want
to make a counter bid,

09:03.591 --> 09:05.058
it has to happen fast.

09:05.126 --> 09:08.695
If you don't know anything, tell
me, so I can go somewhere else.

09:08.763 --> 09:10.998
How well
do you know this man?

09:11.065 --> 09:12.199
You trust him?

09:12.267 --> 09:14.201
There's no one I trust more.

09:14.269 --> 09:15.736
I've been with him
for two years.

09:15.804 --> 09:17.771
What do you mean "with"?

09:17.839 --> 09:19.406
It's professional.

09:21.276 --> 09:23.877
Can you help us or not?

09:29.117 --> 09:31.585
I'll make a few calls,

09:31.653 --> 09:33.587
see what I can
find out.

09:33.655 --> 09:35.189
But, uh,

09:35.256 --> 09:36.890
I'm going to have
to meet this Meier.

09:36.958 --> 09:38.258
And I need a good faith

09:38.326 --> 09:40.260
payment up front.
How much?

09:40.328 --> 09:41.395
Five million.

09:41.463 --> 09:43.964
That's a lot of money, Vlad.

09:44.032 --> 09:46.033
Look, I'm taking big risk
just making these calls.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.267
Besides, 5 million is nothing

09:47.335 --> 09:49.136
compared to what your
buyer will have to pay

09:49.204 --> 09:51.805
for nuclear fuel rods.

09:51.873 --> 09:53.807
Fine.

09:53.875 --> 09:56.610
I'll ask him, but I can't
make any promises.

09:56.678 --> 09:59.279
If he wants my help,
that's the price

09:59.347 --> 10:01.114
of admission.
Okay.

10:01.182 --> 10:03.450
There's a parking garage

10:03.518 --> 10:05.118
on the corner of 12th
and Market Street.

10:05.186 --> 10:07.988
Someone will meet him
there, on the roof.

10:08.056 --> 10:10.557
Once the money is
in our account,

10:10.625 --> 10:13.393
they'll bring him back here,
we will talk.

10:13.461 --> 10:15.863
I'll give him a call.

10:17.899 --> 10:19.533
It's good to see you.

10:22.470 --> 10:25.939
You're going to make me
start losing sleep again.

10:27.976 --> 10:29.710
I'll let you know
what Meier says.

10:30.745 --> 10:32.679
I'll tell my men.

10:32.747 --> 10:35.749
I'll give you privacy
for your call.

11:07.282 --> 11:08.348
Jack, were you listening?

11:08.416 --> 11:09.483
Yeah, we're ready to wire

11:09.551 --> 11:10.551
the money to
his account.

11:10.618 --> 11:11.652
When can you be there?

11:11.719 --> 11:13.287
As soon as I finish
prepping my cover.

11:13.354 --> 11:14.621
I'm almost at the
staging area.

11:14.689 --> 11:16.590
30 minutes tops.

11:17.725 --> 11:18.992
How you holding up?

11:19.060 --> 11:20.761
It's hard to be
in the same room

11:20.828 --> 11:22.496
with this
son of a bitch.

11:22.564 --> 11:23.897
I can handle it.

11:23.965 --> 11:26.199
I'll be there as
soon as I can.

11:26.267 --> 11:28.068
Okay.

11:46.056 --> 11:47.556
Don't worry, Oleg.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.091
You're going to be fine.

11:50.427 --> 11:52.094
It, uh... it might
help me if I knew

11:52.162 --> 11:53.929
exactly what happened
to your brother.

11:53.997 --> 11:57.399
How did he get exposed
to weapons-grade uranium?

11:57.467 --> 11:59.034
Don't worry about that.

11:59.102 --> 12:00.969
Just make sure he lives.

12:02.405 --> 12:04.406
(phone ringing)

12:08.078 --> 12:09.978
It's him again, isn't it?

12:10.046 --> 12:11.780
The second time he's called.

12:11.848 --> 12:13.549
You should
answer it.

12:17.921 --> 12:19.054
Hello?

12:19.122 --> 12:20.489
Why aren't you
picking up your phone?

12:20.557 --> 12:21.724
I called you twice.

12:21.791 --> 12:23.292
Must have been
in the tunnel.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.761
Ulana says you're not
at the house yet.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.229
Where are you?
Stuck in traffic.

12:27.297 --> 12:28.964
Tell her it's going
to be a while.

12:29.032 --> 12:30.032
How's Oleg?

12:30.100 --> 12:31.100
He's okay.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.434
Sleeping.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.737
Let me know when you
get to the house.

12:34.804 --> 12:36.305
I will.

12:37.741 --> 12:39.308
It was him, wasn't it?

12:41.711 --> 12:43.879
Hey.

12:43.947 --> 12:45.314
Don't worry, okay?

12:45.382 --> 12:46.949
By the time he finds out,

12:47.016 --> 12:50.285
you'll already
have been treated.

12:50.353 --> 12:52.087
Then it won't matter.

12:54.324 --> 12:56.592
(knock on door)

12:56.659 --> 12:58.527
Hey, it's just
your brother's test results.

13:01.297 --> 13:02.464
Okay.

13:02.532 --> 13:06.135
You say or do anything
that I don't like,

13:06.202 --> 13:08.237
and my men will kill
your wife and daughter.

13:08.304 --> 13:10.139
Open the door.

13:12.142 --> 13:13.709
The blood work
you ordered, Doctor.

13:13.777 --> 13:14.943
Thank you.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.278
Uh, I noticed there was

13:16.346 --> 13:18.147
no patient name.
Uh, yeah, you're right.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.616
I forgot to put that down.
Oh, well, I can do it for you.

13:20.683 --> 13:21.650
No, I'll take care of it later.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.519
Is everything okay, Doctor?

13:24.921 --> 13:26.255
Fine.

13:26.322 --> 13:27.856
I'm just working a little later

13:27.924 --> 13:29.992
than I expected.
Okay.

13:33.696 --> 13:35.330
You did good.

13:35.398 --> 13:36.965
What does it say?

13:39.569 --> 13:42.404
Your brother has been exposed
to at least 400 rems,

13:42.472 --> 13:43.605
and the chemical toxicity

13:43.673 --> 13:45.307
of the radiation
is causing renal failure.

13:45.375 --> 13:47.209
I know it's serious.

13:47.277 --> 13:49.111
Can you help him or not?

13:49.179 --> 13:50.679
He needs
a bone marrow transplant.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.181
That requires
a six-man surgical team

13:52.248 --> 13:53.515
in a fully equipped facility.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.717
There has to be something
you can do

13:55.785 --> 13:58.220
right here, right now.

13:58.288 --> 13:59.855
There are some drugs
I could give him

13:59.923 --> 14:01.290
that will help
flush out the radiation

14:01.357 --> 14:02.825
and stimulate
white blood cell repair,

14:02.892 --> 14:04.793
but that's a half measure.

14:04.861 --> 14:05.961
I can't guarantee

14:06.029 --> 14:07.396
he'll recover.

14:09.232 --> 14:11.800
My brother is not going to die.

14:11.868 --> 14:14.002
It's up to you, Doctor.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.372
Now get to work.

14:26.382 --> 14:28.217
Okay, got it.

14:29.819 --> 14:31.220
That was CTU.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.554
Your offshore
account's in place.

14:32.622 --> 14:33.856
They're forwarding
instructions to your PDA

14:33.923 --> 14:35.157
on how to wire
the money.

14:35.225 --> 14:36.525
Excuse me.

14:37.560 --> 14:38.494
I spoke
with Hastings.

14:38.561 --> 14:39.862
He said, as soon
as you're under

14:39.929 --> 14:42.431
and we have confirmation
that Laitanan can get us

14:42.499 --> 14:44.366
to the nuclear rods,
we're pulling Renee Walker out.

14:44.434 --> 14:45.868
That's right.

14:47.070 --> 14:48.537
What's going on, Jack?

14:48.605 --> 14:50.339
Hastings said something
about her being unstable.

14:50.406 --> 14:52.040
I don't have time
to explain it.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.575
Just follow my lead.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.377
How do you want to work this
without breaking cover?

14:55.445 --> 14:56.612
I don't know yet.

14:56.679 --> 14:58.380
All right.
Well, I got two teams

14:58.448 --> 14:59.781
running coordinated
drive-bys.

14:59.849 --> 15:00.883
They'll be ready to extract her

15:00.950 --> 15:01.884
when she's clear.
No.

15:01.951 --> 15:02.885
These guys own
this neighborhood.

15:02.952 --> 15:03.919
They'll have eyes everywhere.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.254
Your men
will run the risk

15:05.321 --> 15:07.089
of being spotted.
I've done this before, Jack.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.157
I ran an operation just
like it in Fallujah.

15:09.225 --> 15:10.359
And I'm in command.

15:10.426 --> 15:12.327
You're going to do
exactly what I tell you.

15:12.395 --> 15:13.762
RENEE (over comm):
Jack, stand by.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.597
I hear him coming.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.032
Laitanan's back.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.267
I need to listen to this.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.935
Excuse me.

15:22.005 --> 15:22.938
(knock on door)

15:23.006 --> 15:25.040
VLADIMIR:
Renee.

15:26.075 --> 15:27.609
I spoke to my men.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.545
Did you get your buyer
on the phone?

15:29.612 --> 15:31.013
He agreed
to the money.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.881
He'll be at the parking garage
in 20 minutes. Very good.

15:32.949 --> 15:35.484
We have a little time
to catch up.

15:35.552 --> 15:37.185
Do you still like
your single malts?

15:37.253 --> 15:38.220
Uh, not right now.

15:38.288 --> 15:39.388
You sure?
It's a 30 year.

15:39.455 --> 15:41.089
No, thanks.

15:42.692 --> 15:46.128
What you said earlier-
down at the river-

15:46.195 --> 15:48.163
you were tired
of living,

15:48.231 --> 15:50.165
wanted to die.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.102
What happened to you?

15:54.170 --> 15:55.637
It's not important.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.739
It is to me.

15:57.807 --> 15:59.908
Look, you don't have
to worry about it.

15:59.976 --> 16:03.545
Once I make this deal,
none of it will matter.

16:03.613 --> 16:05.180
Well, you're not the only one

16:05.248 --> 16:07.282
who's been suffering
these past few years.

16:12.155 --> 16:14.723
It's hard for
me to admit,

16:14.791 --> 16:17.092
but, uh...

16:17.160 --> 16:20.996
I never forgave myself
for what I did to you.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.901
It's in the past.

16:25.969 --> 16:27.502
Forget it.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.938
VLADIMIR (over comm):
I don't want to forget it.

16:30.006 --> 16:32.207
I had too much
to drink that night,

16:32.275 --> 16:33.976
I wasn't thinking clearly.

16:34.043 --> 16:36.244
Wow.

16:36.312 --> 16:38.647
Never heard you apologize
for anything.

16:38.715 --> 16:40.482
It's definitely
a first.

16:40.550 --> 16:42.150
Look, I'm just trying
to make things right.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.219
You dot have to be
such a bitch about it.

16:44.287 --> 16:46.088
Was I being a bitch?
Maybe I should apologize.

16:46.155 --> 16:47.289
Oh, you're
something else.

16:47.357 --> 16:49.124
You never back
down, do you?

16:51.961 --> 16:54.930
I've missed our
little arguments.

17:04.473 --> 17:06.508
You're still
nervous around me.

17:07.542 --> 17:09.144
I shouldn't be surprised.

17:10.179 --> 17:11.380
It's not you.

17:12.515 --> 17:13.982
VLADIMIR:
Someone else?

17:14.050 --> 17:15.517
RENEE:
No.

17:15.585 --> 17:17.452
VLADIMIR:
What is it, then?

17:17.520 --> 17:18.987
Look, I'm just...

17:19.055 --> 17:20.388
I'm just nervous about the deal.

17:20.455 --> 17:22.190
Could be a lot of money
at stake.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.826
There's more for you here
than just money,

17:24.894 --> 17:26.728
if you want it.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.597
Look...

17:30.266 --> 17:32.768
I didn't come here
for this.

17:32.835 --> 17:35.737
Really. All the people
you could've gone to,

17:35.805 --> 17:37.372
you knocked on my door.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.940
Because you're connected.

17:39.008 --> 17:41.009
That's the only reason?
Yes.

17:41.077 --> 17:42.978
I don't believe you.

17:43.046 --> 17:45.213
That's your problem.

17:45.281 --> 17:46.615
You should watch
your tongue.

17:46.683 --> 17:48.884
You might lose
it one day.

17:48.951 --> 17:52.387
Uh... you said
that I could get cleaned up.

17:54.023 --> 17:55.657
Yeah.

17:55.725 --> 17:57.259
Bathroom has a shower.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.727
Thank you.
Yeah.

18:03.900 --> 18:06.702
Agent Ortiz, we
need to move now.

18:06.769 --> 18:08.603
Now!

18:08.671 --> 18:11.106
(releases held breath,
breathes deeply)

18:23.119 --> 18:24.553
Renee called her buyer.

18:24.620 --> 18:27.189
He agreed to pay
the $5 million up front.

18:27.256 --> 18:28.623
I want you
to meet with him.

18:28.691 --> 18:29.758
Take a couple men.

18:29.826 --> 18:30.926
This is a mistake, Vlad.

18:30.993 --> 18:32.294
Getting involved
in nuclear arms-

18:32.361 --> 18:35.263
it doesn't matter how
much money is at stake.

18:35.331 --> 18:37.065
I have no intention

18:37.133 --> 18:39.167
of pursuing this deal.
What do you mean?

18:39.235 --> 18:41.269
When you've
picked up the buyer,

18:41.337 --> 18:44.039
when the money has been
transferred into our account,

18:44.107 --> 18:46.808
you kill him, put him
in the river, keep the money

18:46.876 --> 18:48.543
for ourselves.

18:48.611 --> 18:50.378
What about Renee?

18:52.682 --> 18:55.751
She'll be working with us
from now on.

18:55.818 --> 18:57.619
We are going to
kill her buyer.

18:57.687 --> 18:59.988
She's not going to
be happy about that.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.323
You heard what she said.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.390
She's got nothing left.

19:02.458 --> 19:03.792
Nowhere to go.
Desperate woman.

19:05.828 --> 19:08.096
I give her reason to live.

19:08.164 --> 19:09.931
Okay?

19:09.999 --> 19:11.933
I'll take care of it.

19:28.364 --> 19:30.065
President Hassan's
security forces-

19:30.133 --> 19:31.967
they're still cracking
down on the opposition,

19:32.035 --> 19:33.168
and they're not showing

19:33.236 --> 19:34.803
any signs
of letting up.

19:34.871 --> 19:36.538
ETHAN:
I'm afraid your warning

19:36.606 --> 19:38.707
to President Hassan
has fallen on deaf ears,

19:38.775 --> 19:39.741
Madam President.

19:39.809 --> 19:41.310
Who filmed this?

19:41.377 --> 19:42.678
Stringer for the BBC bought it
from an eyewitness.

19:42.745 --> 19:45.247
And they've already seen it
on Downing Street.

19:45.315 --> 19:47.049
That's why Ethan wanted you
to see this now.

19:47.116 --> 19:49.318
The rumors have already started
that the British

19:49.385 --> 19:52.421
are pulling out
as signatories to the accord.

19:52.488 --> 19:54.323
Then I need to talk
to the prime minister.

19:54.390 --> 19:56.491
It's not just the British,
Madam President.

19:56.559 --> 19:57.526
The Germans and Egyptians

19:57.593 --> 19:58.927
are also positioning
themselves

19:58.995 --> 20:00.829
to pull out, and if we
lose their support...

20:00.897 --> 20:02.164
The peace deal

20:02.231 --> 20:03.398
is dead.

20:04.867 --> 20:06.601
Maybe if they understood
the circumstances-

20:06.669 --> 20:08.503
that Hassan is trying
to prevent his brother

20:08.571 --> 20:10.172
from acquiring a nuclear weapon.

20:10.239 --> 20:11.306
With respect,
Madam President,

20:11.374 --> 20:12.407
sharing that intelligence

20:12.475 --> 20:14.142
with the delegates
might spread a panic.

20:14.210 --> 20:18.380
You're right, but I still need
to buy some time.

20:22.719 --> 20:25.053
Assemble the representatives

20:25.121 --> 20:27.122
from every signatory country
attending the conference.

20:29.292 --> 20:31.760
I want to appeal to them myself
to stay the course.

20:31.828 --> 20:33.662
What about President Hassan?

20:33.730 --> 20:35.664
Shouldn't we include him?

20:35.732 --> 20:36.999
Not until I've taken
the temperature

20:37.066 --> 20:38.100
of the other delegates.

20:38.167 --> 20:40.936
I don't want
to push him too hard.

20:49.345 --> 20:50.412
What is it?

20:50.480 --> 20:52.614
As you requested,
these are backgrounds

20:52.682 --> 20:54.516
on all the detainees.

20:54.584 --> 20:56.752
Our security police have
completed their initial sweep

20:56.819 --> 20:58.053
of the capital city.

20:58.121 --> 20:59.855
65 known members of the
opposition have been arrested

20:59.922 --> 21:01.289
and are being
questioned.

21:01.357 --> 21:02.424
Have you learned anything?

21:02.492 --> 21:05.060
Were any of them working
with my brother?

21:05.128 --> 21:07.129
It's too early to tell.

21:11.434 --> 21:13.468
What's wrong, sir?

21:14.504 --> 21:17.706
One of the suspects...

21:17.774 --> 21:18.940
has family connections

21:19.008 --> 21:21.576
to a member of my
delegation here at the UN.

21:21.644 --> 21:22.778
Who?

21:22.845 --> 21:24.546
Jamot.

21:24.614 --> 21:25.814
They are cousins.

21:27.850 --> 21:30.752
That doesn't mean that Jamot
is involved in any of this.

21:30.820 --> 21:32.788
We need to make sure.

21:32.855 --> 21:35.390
We'll check his phone records
and other recent activities

21:35.458 --> 21:36.658
for any suspicious behavior.

21:36.726 --> 21:38.293
Good.

21:38.361 --> 21:40.095
But I also want him
taken into custody.

21:40.163 --> 21:41.463
Sir?

21:41.531 --> 21:42.631
Arrest him.

21:42.698 --> 21:44.599
Take him to our embassy
for interrogation.

21:45.668 --> 21:48.136
Mr. President, with respect,

21:48.204 --> 21:50.572
Jamot is a trusted member
of your inner circle.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.974
The evidence against him
is purely circumstantial.

21:55.978 --> 21:59.281
I trusted my brother as well.

22:00.516 --> 22:02.651
Are you sure
this is what you want?

22:02.718 --> 22:04.219
He is
a public official.

22:04.287 --> 22:05.654
It will not go
unnoticed.

22:05.721 --> 22:06.955
I don't care!

22:09.225 --> 22:11.426
I don't care what anyone thinks.

22:13.996 --> 22:16.631
I was almost killed today.

22:16.699 --> 22:17.966
Or have you forgotten?

22:18.034 --> 22:21.336
I was in the car
with you, sir.

22:21.404 --> 22:23.972
Then you should know
what needs to be done.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.575
Yes, sir.

22:55.638 --> 22:58.039
(clears throat)

23:03.479 --> 23:05.413
ARLO:
Forget about me?

23:05.481 --> 23:06.414
What?

23:06.482 --> 23:07.549
My name's Arlo Glass.

23:07.617 --> 23:09.084
I'm one of your
coworkers at CTU.

23:09.152 --> 23:10.252
You said you'd free up

23:10.319 --> 23:12.487
some memory space on
the auxiliary servers.

23:12.555 --> 23:13.922
I'm getting to it.

23:13.990 --> 23:15.824
In which century? We're in
the middle of an operation

23:15.892 --> 23:17.359
and my aerial feed is
running in slow-motion.

23:17.426 --> 23:20.529
It's next on my list, Arlo.

23:20.596 --> 23:21.563
Where are you
going now?

23:21.631 --> 23:22.564
To the bathroom.

23:22.632 --> 23:24.633
Is that okay with you?

23:28.104 --> 23:30.038
Hey, O'Brian,

23:30.106 --> 23:31.673
you notice anything
weird about Dana?

23:31.741 --> 23:32.941
Miss Perfect?

23:33.009 --> 23:33.942
She seems
distracted,

23:34.010 --> 23:35.877
always making excuses to leave.

23:35.945 --> 23:37.612
Maybe she's avoiding you.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.047
What?
Well, that's what I would do

23:39.115 --> 23:40.949
if someone were drooling
over me all day.

23:41.017 --> 23:42.217
You're lucky she
hasn't reported you

23:42.285 --> 23:43.251
to Human Resources.

23:43.319 --> 23:44.419
If you weren't so jealous,

23:44.487 --> 23:46.821
you'd see I was asking you
a serious question.

23:46.889 --> 23:48.623
Oh, yeah, I'm jealous.

23:48.691 --> 23:52.294
Please, won't you stare
at my ass as I walk away?

24:03.439 --> 24:05.373
Thank you.

24:05.441 --> 24:07.442
You're welcome.

24:11.180 --> 24:14.282
Stay here.

24:23.659 --> 24:25.527
This has the address
and schematic

24:25.595 --> 24:26.895
of the evidence lockup.

24:26.963 --> 24:28.964
You'll go through
the southeast entrance.

24:29.031 --> 24:31.900
This keycard
will get you access.

24:31.968 --> 24:34.803
How do we find the money?

24:34.870 --> 24:36.905
The evidence bins are numbered.

24:36.973 --> 24:39.941
You're looking for 4301.

24:40.009 --> 24:42.244
This is a dedicated comm unit.

24:42.311 --> 24:43.712
It's an earpiece; you'll
be able to hear me.

24:43.779 --> 24:45.580
Do exactly
what I tell you to do

24:45.648 --> 24:46.581
and you'll be in and out.

24:46.649 --> 24:48.016
No one will know
you were there.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.455
Listen...

24:53.522 --> 24:57.025
I help you do this
and you never call me again.

24:57.093 --> 24:59.094
That's the deal, right?

25:00.129 --> 25:03.965
Sure, Jen, that's the deal.

25:07.003 --> 25:10.739
I'll call you
when we get to the lockup.

25:10.806 --> 25:12.540
Okay.
Okay.

25:40.870 --> 25:43.872
(water running, turns off)

25:52.481 --> 25:54.482
You look thin.

25:55.518 --> 25:57.819
Be out in a minute.

25:57.887 --> 26:00.655
I don't want to wait that long.

26:00.723 --> 26:05.293
Vladimir, please,
just let me get dressed.

26:05.361 --> 26:06.695
Why waste the energy?

26:06.762 --> 26:09.264
I'll just have to get you
undressed all over again.

26:13.969 --> 26:16.805
Look, I already told you
I didn't come here for this.

26:16.872 --> 26:19.607
That's what you say, but part
of you came here to see me.

26:19.675 --> 26:20.709
Admit it.

26:20.776 --> 26:22.877
RENEE:
There's nothing to admit.

26:22.945 --> 26:25.647
VLADIMIR: Why is it so hard
for you to admit the truth?

26:26.949 --> 26:28.983
You want this just
as much as I do.

26:29.051 --> 26:30.652
I'm not going
to tell you again.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.054
Leave me alone
and let me get dressed.

26:34.090 --> 26:36.524
Come here.

26:38.561 --> 26:40.729
I said come here.

26:45.267 --> 26:46.368
(glass shatters)

26:46.435 --> 26:49.337
Come here or get out.

26:49.405 --> 26:52.207
I call my men
and the deal's off.

27:24.807 --> 27:28.643
I'll, um... I'll take
that drink now.

27:29.645 --> 27:32.280
Dry yourself off.

27:32.348 --> 27:33.915
Come out when
you're ready.

27:47.797 --> 27:50.064
JACK:
Renee, do you copy?

27:50.132 --> 27:51.466
Yeah, Jack.

27:51.534 --> 27:53.034
You don't have
to do this.

27:53.102 --> 27:54.269
I've got a team
standing by.

27:54.336 --> 27:55.637
We can get you
out of there now.

27:55.704 --> 27:59.073
Where would that leave us?

27:59.141 --> 28:00.675
I've got to stay under.

28:00.743 --> 28:04.712
We'll find another way.

28:04.780 --> 28:08.416
There is no other way.

28:08.484 --> 28:11.953
Renee, don't do this.

28:12.021 --> 28:13.121
Renee...

28:13.189 --> 28:14.389
Go meet Vlad's men.

28:14.457 --> 28:15.824
I'll see you when you get here.

28:15.891 --> 28:17.192
Why won't you listen
to me?

28:17.259 --> 28:18.159
I'm going dark.

28:18.227 --> 28:19.461
Renee, wai...

28:49.102 --> 28:50.602
These arrests are making
it very difficult

28:50.670 --> 28:51.837
for my government
to continue

28:51.905 --> 28:53.105
to support the
peace agreement.

28:53.173 --> 28:54.406
President Hassan

28:54.474 --> 28:56.709
can't ignore the repercussions
of what he's doing.

28:56.776 --> 28:58.210
I know President Hassan.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.546
He is a rational man,
a good man.

29:00.613 --> 29:02.181
There must be a reason
for these actions,

29:02.248 --> 29:04.083
and I'm not just speaking
as his delegate

29:04.150 --> 29:05.284
but as his friend.

29:05.351 --> 29:06.785
Well, as his friend,
you need to let him know

29:06.853 --> 29:10.489
that my government is not the
only one with grave concerns.

29:10.557 --> 29:12.124
This conference is at
risk of falling apart...

29:12.192 --> 29:13.926
Excuse me,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

29:13.993 --> 29:16.295
Mr. Jamot, may I speak
with you privately?

29:16.362 --> 29:17.463
Yes, of course.

29:17.530 --> 29:18.464
Excuse me.

29:18.531 --> 29:19.465
Of course.

29:19.532 --> 29:21.967
What is it?

29:22.035 --> 29:23.402
I've been ordered
to escort you

29:23.470 --> 29:25.037
to the embassy to
answer some questions.

29:25.105 --> 29:27.339
Regarding?

29:27.407 --> 29:28.540
An internal
security matter.

29:28.608 --> 29:30.709
Please come with us.

29:30.777 --> 29:32.044
Well, I-I would like

29:32.112 --> 29:33.412
to know
what this is about.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.180
We'll explain everything
to you at the embassy, sir.

29:35.248 --> 29:36.215
Well, it will have to wait.

29:36.282 --> 29:37.449
I am about to go
into a meeting.

29:37.517 --> 29:39.351
It cannot wait, sir.

29:39.419 --> 29:42.821
We need to go
right now.

29:45.959 --> 29:48.961
Are you arresting me?

29:49.028 --> 29:52.030
It would be best
if we kept this discreet.

29:52.098 --> 29:54.666
This is outrageous.

29:54.734 --> 29:56.168
I demand to speak
with President Hassan.

29:56.236 --> 29:59.304
President Hassan is the one
who gave this order.

29:59.372 --> 30:01.707
I will not
ask you again.

30:01.775 --> 30:03.909
Come with us.

30:08.381 --> 30:10.315
Very well.

30:10.383 --> 30:11.350
Take him
to the car.

30:11.417 --> 30:13.418
I'll be
right there.

30:18.591 --> 30:20.392
Is everything all right?

30:20.460 --> 30:21.527
Everything is fine, sir.

30:21.594 --> 30:22.795
Please excuse me.

30:29.102 --> 30:31.970
(phone rings)

30:32.038 --> 30:33.172
Hello.

30:33.239 --> 30:35.040
It's me. Are you alone? Yes.

30:35.108 --> 30:37.075
What's wrong?
You sound upset.

30:37.143 --> 30:38.310
I didn't want
to burden you with this,

30:38.378 --> 30:40.112
but I need to speak
with you about your father.

30:42.782 --> 30:43.849
What is it?

30:43.917 --> 30:45.717
I have to go to the embassy
right now.

30:45.785 --> 30:49.621
I'll meet you in private
when I get back.

30:49.689 --> 30:52.090
You're going to give him
vindesine twice daily,

30:52.158 --> 30:53.425
morning and night.

30:53.493 --> 30:55.194
Inject it right into
the I.V. bag,

30:55.261 --> 30:57.529
just like I'm doing.

30:57.597 --> 30:59.531
You're going to want
to be careful.

30:59.599 --> 31:00.632
Radiation poisoning

31:00.700 --> 31:03.902
is transferable
through bodily fluids.

31:03.970 --> 31:05.637
Are you paying attention?

31:05.705 --> 31:07.606
Yes, I see.

31:07.674 --> 31:10.943
He's also going to get
cisplatin every other day,

31:11.010 --> 31:12.611
but he can take
that in pill form.

31:12.679 --> 31:15.414
I'm going to give you
three weeks' worth.

31:15.481 --> 31:17.416
How will I know
if he's getting better?

31:17.483 --> 31:20.219
If the treatment's working, his
symptoms will begin to subside

31:20.286 --> 31:22.654
in seven to ten days.

31:24.190 --> 31:26.124
We're going to be
leaving soon.

31:26.192 --> 31:27.826
Where? To the country house.

31:27.894 --> 31:29.494
The doctor's giving me

31:29.562 --> 31:31.029
everything I need
to treat y.

31:31.097 --> 31:32.264
You're going
to get better, Oleg.

31:32.332 --> 31:34.299
(knocking on door)

31:34.367 --> 31:38.503
That's the nurse with
the rest of the medicine.

31:50.683 --> 31:51.717
(gunshot)

31:51.784 --> 31:54.786
Throw down
your weapon, Josef.

31:57.223 --> 31:59.558
Do what I said.

31:59.626 --> 32:01.860
Don't make this worse
than it is.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.867
Drop it!

32:14.240 --> 32:17.009
You son of a bitch.

32:17.076 --> 32:19.778
Who else knows about
Oleg's sickness?

32:19.846 --> 32:21.813
Who else knows?

32:21.881 --> 32:22.814
Just the doctor.

32:22.882 --> 32:23.815
Are you sure?

32:23.883 --> 32:24.816
I'm sure.

32:24.884 --> 32:25.951
Undo him.

32:29.555 --> 32:31.490
Hey, wait, stop.

32:31.557 --> 32:33.125
What are you doing?
Your father sent us

32:33.192 --> 32:34.693
to bring you home.

32:34.761 --> 32:36.662
Now, Josef.
OLEG: Josef...

32:36.729 --> 32:38.063
it's okay.

32:38.131 --> 32:39.331
Just do what he says.

32:44.404 --> 32:46.538
I have him.

32:52.445 --> 32:54.546
We found them.

32:54.614 --> 32:55.580
Where were they?

32:55.648 --> 32:57.349
A clinic in Mount Vernon.

32:57.417 --> 32:59.217
How many people found out
about Oleg?

32:59.285 --> 33:00.852
Only one- a doctor-

33:00.920 --> 33:02.087
but we've
taken care of him.

33:02.155 --> 33:03.388
Nobody will know
we were here.

33:03.456 --> 33:04.523
Good.

33:04.590 --> 33:06.191
Now, bring my
sons to me.

33:06.259 --> 33:07.492
<i>Da.</i>

33:09.429 --> 33:11.063
Let's go.

33:37.290 --> 33:38.557
Meier?

33:38.624 --> 33:40.625
That's right.

33:41.828 --> 33:43.328
You are from Germany.

33:43.396 --> 33:44.930
Bremen.

33:44.998 --> 33:47.733
But I grew up traveling
with my father.

33:48.768 --> 33:50.736
(speaking German)

34:27.040 --> 34:29.141
Are we going to do business
or not?

34:29.208 --> 34:30.574
Where is the $5 million?

34:30.643 --> 34:33.078
You don't see any money
until I talk to Laitanan.

34:33.146 --> 34:34.980
If you
have questions,

34:35.047 --> 34:36.114
ask me.

34:36.181 --> 34:37.748
I don't want to talk to you.

34:39.085 --> 34:40.886
Get him on the phone
or I drive away.

34:40.953 --> 34:42.521
Now.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.632
(phone rings)

34:56.302 --> 34:57.436
Yes?

34:57.503 --> 34:58.837
LUGO:
Meier is here.

34:58.905 --> 35:00.572
He won't transfer
the money

35:00.640 --> 35:02.407
until he speaks
with you first.

35:03.443 --> 35:04.910
Put him on.

35:08.815 --> 35:10.682
This is Meier.

35:10.750 --> 35:12.050
Yes, Mr. Meier.

35:12.118 --> 35:13.485
What's the problem?

35:13.553 --> 35:15.387
After you
get your money,

35:15.455 --> 35:17.589
how long till I get
my information?

35:17.657 --> 35:19.524
Not very long; I just
have to make a few calls.

35:19.592 --> 35:20.926
No more than an hour.

35:20.993 --> 35:22.060
Where is Renee?

35:22.128 --> 35:24.229
She's busy.

35:24.297 --> 35:25.730
I would like
to talk to her.

35:25.798 --> 35:27.666
VLADIMIR: You can see
her when you get here.

35:27.733 --> 35:29.067
We have nothing
more to discuss

35:29.135 --> 35:30.135
until the money's
in place.

35:30.203 --> 35:31.503
Now, get Lugo
on the phone.

35:32.538 --> 35:34.272
Fine.

35:39.412 --> 35:40.879
Go ahead.

35:40.947 --> 35:43.115
Once the money is confirmed
into our account,

35:43.182 --> 35:45.217
you know what to do.

35:45.284 --> 35:47.486
Yes.

35:48.654 --> 35:51.189
I need your account number.

36:01.534 --> 36:02.801
JACK:
I'm transferring the money

36:02.869 --> 36:04.669
through multiple accounts
so it can't be traced.

36:04.737 --> 36:06.705
This will take
a moment.

36:06.772 --> 36:08.607
We'll wait.

36:23.162 --> 36:24.829
Is it done?

36:24.897 --> 36:26.264
Not yet.

36:26.332 --> 36:27.966
My partner's good
for the money, Vladimir.

36:28.033 --> 36:29.601
You should be making calls,

36:29.668 --> 36:30.668
tracking down
the rods.

36:30.736 --> 36:32.136
I'm not going
to make any calls,

36:32.204 --> 36:34.072
'cause there isn't going
to be any deal

36:34.139 --> 36:35.139
with your partner.

36:35.207 --> 36:36.574
What are you talking about?

36:36.642 --> 36:40.011
Once we have the money...

36:40.079 --> 36:41.112
it's over.

36:41.180 --> 36:42.347
We don't need him anymore.

36:42.414 --> 36:44.482
And we'll be
$5 million richer.

36:44.550 --> 36:46.117
You son of a bitch.

36:46.185 --> 36:47.852
Hey, I'm not a fool, Renee.
I'm not about

36:47.920 --> 36:49.754
to get involved with the kind
of people who traffic

36:49.822 --> 36:51.789
in nuclear arms. Okay, Vladimir,
listen, you can't do this.

36:51.857 --> 36:53.658
Why? This man
mean something to you?

36:53.726 --> 36:55.727
No, but I worked for more
than a year to make this deal.

36:55.794 --> 36:57.996
I'm not just going to let it go
because you don't have the guts

36:58.063 --> 36:59.497
to see it through.
Hey, this isn't about guts.

36:59.565 --> 37:00.531
This is about being smart.

37:00.599 --> 37:01.633
Really?

37:01.700 --> 37:03.234
Is it smart
to keep selling small arms

37:03.302 --> 37:04.435
for the rest of your life?

37:04.503 --> 37:05.970
I bring you the score
of a lifetime,

37:06.038 --> 37:07.171
and you just piss it away?

37:07.239 --> 37:08.206
For what- for $5 million?

37:08.274 --> 37:09.741
How long is that
going to last you?

37:09.808 --> 37:10.775
Long enough.

37:10.843 --> 37:12.944
You're more
than all this.

37:13.012 --> 37:14.646
I know it.

37:14.713 --> 37:17.215
It's why I brought this deal
to you.

37:19.251 --> 37:20.852
We can do this.

37:20.920 --> 37:23.087
Together.

37:23.155 --> 37:26.958
Once we've made the deal
and we have the money,

37:27.026 --> 37:29.027
we can be together.

37:30.229 --> 37:32.864
We could start over.

37:32.932 --> 37:35.800
Make our own moves.

37:35.868 --> 37:38.303
But I need my buyer.

37:38.370 --> 37:40.405
Alive.

37:44.209 --> 37:45.643
Sorry.

37:45.711 --> 37:47.879
This is the
way I want it.

37:47.947 --> 37:49.113
You'll see.

37:49.181 --> 37:50.949
It's for the best.

37:53.118 --> 37:54.886
What are you doing?

37:54.954 --> 37:57.188
Making a call.

37:57.256 --> 37:59.190
Put down the phone.

37:59.258 --> 38:01.526
I said put it down!

38:04.897 --> 38:06.731
Don't ever
go against me!

38:08.567 --> 38:11.369
Renee, you should
know that by now.

38:11.437 --> 38:13.404
Okay?!

38:36.295 --> 38:37.662
How much longer?

38:37.730 --> 38:40.198
It's almost done.

38:44.903 --> 38:46.437
There.

38:48.674 --> 38:51.175
The money's in
your account.

38:51.243 --> 38:52.343
LUGO:
Thank you,

38:52.411 --> 38:53.511
Mr. Meier.

38:53.579 --> 38:55.747
(gunshots)

38:59.151 --> 39:02.387
Drop the weapon.
Now! Drop it!

39:07.960 --> 39:09.160
You really think
I'm that stupid?

39:09.228 --> 39:11.329
That I'd come
here alone?

39:11.397 --> 39:13.297
Call your man. Do it!

39:17.269 --> 39:19.871
Give me the phone.

39:19.938 --> 39:21.939
(phone ringing)

39:23.308 --> 39:25.076
I see we have the money.

39:25.144 --> 39:26.711
Is Meier dead?

39:26.779 --> 39:28.780
Not exactly, but I've just
taken out three of your men,

39:28.847 --> 39:30.882
and I'm ready
to take out the fourth.

39:30.949 --> 39:32.183
Meier.

39:32.251 --> 39:35.019
You really think you can
roll me for $5 million?

39:35.087 --> 39:36.721
Where's Renee?

39:36.789 --> 39:38.589
She's right here. She's fine.

39:38.657 --> 39:40.558
I want proof now!

39:41.593 --> 39:43.795
Say something to your partner.

39:43.862 --> 39:45.696
Meier, are you okay?

39:46.999 --> 39:48.466
Satisfied?

39:48.534 --> 39:50.902
Renee told me you were ready
to take your organization

39:50.969 --> 39:51.903
to the next level.

39:51.970 --> 39:53.071
Apparently, she was wrong.

39:53.138 --> 39:54.272
Not necessarily.

39:54.339 --> 39:56.207
I'm willing to reconsider
the situation.

39:56.275 --> 39:58.609
The only thing you should
consider yourself is lucky.

39:58.677 --> 40:00.478
And I still want
this deal to happen.

40:00.546 --> 40:01.913
Otherwise,
you'd be dead.

40:01.980 --> 40:04.048
You try something like this
again, we're going to war,

40:04.116 --> 40:05.783
and that's the last
thing you want.

40:06.819 --> 40:08.219
Let me talk to my man.

40:08.287 --> 40:09.220
Fine.

40:09.288 --> 40:11.289
(breathing heavily)

40:13.459 --> 40:14.725
Yes?

40:14.793 --> 40:16.994
Bring him back here.

40:17.062 --> 40:18.729
Are you sure?

40:18.797 --> 40:20.398
Yeah.

40:24.303 --> 40:25.937
He wants to see you.

40:26.004 --> 40:27.705
Get up.

40:34.012 --> 40:35.913
Move to the driver's-side door.

40:35.981 --> 40:37.682
Slowly.

40:46.492 --> 40:48.192
Get in.

40:57.870 --> 40:59.036
I'm sorry, Oleg.

41:00.539 --> 41:02.106
(footsteps approaching)

41:02.174 --> 41:03.508
Leave us.

41:10.549 --> 41:12.650
I couldn't let him die.

41:12.718 --> 41:13.784
He's my brother.

41:13.852 --> 41:16.654
And he's my son.

41:16.722 --> 41:18.856
Do you think this
is any easier for me?

41:18.924 --> 41:20.992
It would've worked.

41:21.059 --> 41:22.727
The doctor was treating him.

41:22.794 --> 41:25.229
You disobeyed me, Josef.
You put this family

41:25.297 --> 41:26.497
at risk.

41:26.565 --> 41:28.466
<i>You put this family
at risk when you sent</i>

41:28.534 --> 41:30.501
those men into the clinic.
They killed

41:30.569 --> 41:31.903
three people!

41:31.970 --> 41:33.371
What do you think's
gonna happen when

41:33.438 --> 41:34.839
the police start
to investigate?!

41:36.108 --> 41:39.377
Who are you to question
my judgment?

41:39.444 --> 41:41.345
You are my first-born.

41:41.413 --> 41:43.080
You, of all people,
should give me respect.

41:43.148 --> 41:45.683
I do respect you.

41:45.751 --> 41:47.051
But this time you're wrong.

41:47.119 --> 41:50.421
The doctor said that
Oleg could be treated.

41:50.489 --> 41:52.690
He showed me how!

41:52.758 --> 41:54.158
All we need is

41:54.226 --> 41:56.227
the medicine!

41:56.295 --> 41:58.563
There are rules, Josef.

41:58.630 --> 41:59.597
(grunts)

41:59.665 --> 42:01.098
They are simple rules.

42:01.166 --> 42:03.367
(Josef grunts)

42:03.435 --> 42:05.770
And they must never be broken!
Never endanger

42:05.837 --> 42:08.039
the family; never.

42:08.106 --> 42:09.874
And never disobey an order
from your father.

42:11.343 --> 42:12.944
Papa... (speaks Russian)

42:13.011 --> 42:15.213
JOSEF:
No, please,

42:15.280 --> 42:16.347
No, please.

42:16.415 --> 42:18.316
You made me do this, Josef.

42:19.651 --> 42:21.252
Please. Please don't.

42:25.457 --> 42:26.824
I'm sorry, my son.

42:35.067 --> 42:36.567
Get up.

42:37.736 --> 42:39.403
Get up!

42:41.506 --> 42:43.541
Now, call Father Gregor.

42:43.609 --> 42:45.843
He'll pray over Oleg.

42:45.911 --> 42:49.480
When he's finished,
we'll bury your brother.

42:56.021 --> 42:57.922
Never disobey me again.
