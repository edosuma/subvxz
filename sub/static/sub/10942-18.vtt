00:00.015 --> 00:01.447
<i>Previously on "Heartland"...</i>

00:01.717 --> 00:03.284
What happened
with the restructuring?

00:03.352 --> 00:04.952
Bedford Oil is history.

00:05.020 --> 00:07.154
- What?
- Now there's nothing to stop me

00:07.222 --> 00:08.689
from being here with you.

00:08.756 --> 00:10.757
I don't think that I can
live like this anymore.

00:10.825 --> 00:13.226
- What're you saying?
- I think I wanna go back to school.

00:13.294 --> 00:14.361
Okay, yeah.

00:14.429 --> 00:16.730
Tim's selling
Big River Ranch.

00:16.798 --> 00:19.132
But there's this kid, Shane,
staying at the dude ranch

00:19.200 --> 00:21.100
and he really wants
to go riding.

00:21.168 --> 00:23.537
Wow! It's like you were
born on a saddle.

00:23.604 --> 00:24.804
You know,
your boy's a natural.

00:24.871 --> 00:26.939
I'm not here
to relive the past, Tim.

00:27.006 --> 00:28.106
<i>I'm just here</i>
<i>because I...</i>

00:28.174 --> 00:29.475
Because why?

00:29.543 --> 00:31.444
I want my son to know
who his father is.

00:38.051 --> 00:39.084
Oh...

00:40.019 --> 00:41.118
(Sighs heavily)

00:45.924 --> 00:47.325
(Horse whinnies)

00:51.864 --> 00:54.332
(Hooves thud in the snow,
horses whinny)

01:01.506 --> 01:03.640
Amy: You know, it's nice that you
get to stay a little longer.

01:03.708 --> 01:06.243
Shane: Yeah. My mom changed
her mind about leaving.

01:06.310 --> 01:07.778
That's great.

01:08.713 --> 01:11.582
Actually, I got a theory
about this whole thing.

01:11.649 --> 01:13.816
Yeah? What's that?

01:13.884 --> 01:16.252
Well... well, you know,
it's just a theory.

01:16.319 --> 01:18.755
Okay.
You gonna tell me?

01:18.822 --> 01:20.490
Mmm... ah, no.

01:20.557 --> 01:22.358
No, it might be kinda dumb.

01:22.426 --> 01:24.093
Hey, can we start
our riding lesson?

01:24.160 --> 01:26.128
I think I'm getting
pretty good, right?

01:26.196 --> 01:27.263
Well, you do have
a good teacher.

01:27.698 --> 01:29.297

01:42.311 --> 01:44.879
(Engine turns off,
truck doors open and close)

01:44.946 --> 01:46.046
Oh no!

01:47.382 --> 01:48.482
No!

01:51.185 --> 01:53.220
(Hooves thud heavily)

01:59.528 --> 02:01.528
Lisa: I'd like you to
meet Bonnie and Clyde.

02:01.595 --> 02:03.329
Aren't they
the most gorgeous animals?

02:03.397 --> 02:05.432
Jack: Look at these guys.
Lisa: Yeah.

02:05.499 --> 02:06.966
<i>Jack:</i> <i>What do you
think there,</i> <i>Shane?</i>

02:07.034 --> 02:08.668
<i>Shane:</i>
<i>Awesome!</i>

02:08.735 --> 02:10.836
The biggest horses
I've ever seen.

02:10.905 --> 02:12.338
<i>Lisa:</i>
<i>They're Clydesdales,</i>

02:12.406 --> 02:15.074
and they are pulling
the lead float

02:15.142 --> 02:17.342
at the Hudson Winter Fair.

02:17.410 --> 02:19.344
Aren't they a nice match?

02:19.412 --> 02:21.046
They're pretty awesome.

02:21.113 --> 02:22.614
Shoulda seen the deal
I got on them.

02:22.682 --> 02:24.282
Yeah, I'm sure.

02:24.350 --> 02:25.751
No, really!

02:25.819 --> 02:27.052
Although, Amy,
I was wondering

02:27.119 --> 02:28.153
if you could work with them
just a little bit

02:28.220 --> 02:29.254
to get them used
to pulling the sleigh.

02:30.924 --> 02:33.257
What,
they're not trained yet?

02:33.325 --> 02:35.125
You didn't buy 'em
'cause they're pretty?

02:35.193 --> 02:36.828
No, but the owner did say

02:36.895 --> 02:38.796
that they have a few
little behavioral issues.

02:38.864 --> 02:40.498
Other than that
they're perfect together.

02:40.566 --> 02:42.232
Did they happen to say
what those issues are?

02:42.300 --> 02:44.401
Um...He said they're kind of
like an old married couple,

02:44.470 --> 02:46.170
kind of bicker
now and again.

02:46.237 --> 02:47.605
But other than that

02:47.673 --> 02:49.238
they basically can't live
without each other.

02:49.306 --> 02:50.807
What do you think?
Are you game?

02:50.875 --> 02:52.075
I would love
to work with them!

02:52.142 --> 02:53.276
I gotta show, Ty.
This is cool!

02:55.546 --> 02:58.381
Amy: Ty?! Hey, you gotta come
see these horses Lisa bought.

02:58.449 --> 03:00.717
I slept in!
I'm gonna be late for my exam.

03:00.785 --> 03:01.952
Well, they're Clydesdales.

03:02.019 --> 03:03.019
She asked me
to train them for her

03:03.087 --> 03:04.420
for the Winter Fair parade.

03:04.488 --> 03:05.554
You could help me.

03:05.622 --> 03:07.356
We could maybe work
on this together.

03:07.423 --> 03:09.024
Uh... sounds good.

03:09.092 --> 03:10.659
I... I gotta go, Amy.

03:10.727 --> 03:13.061
If there's any traffic
on the freeway, I'm done.

03:13.129 --> 03:14.129

(Papers rustle)

05:30.557 --> 05:32.726
Hmm.

05:32.793 --> 05:35.294
So I guess now
you believe me?

05:35.362 --> 05:36.830
I guess so.

05:39.233 --> 05:40.533
So what do you want?

05:40.601 --> 05:41.801
I told you.

05:42.737 --> 05:44.803
Shane's growing up.

05:44.871 --> 05:46.038
He's asking a whole lot
of questions

05:46.106 --> 05:47.940
about who his dad is,

05:48.008 --> 05:49.842
what kind of a guy he was.

05:49.909 --> 05:51.043
He's at that age, you know,

05:51.111 --> 05:54.412
when he should have
a man in his life,

05:55.314 --> 05:57.650
one he can look up to.

05:57.717 --> 05:59.584
How did you imagine
breaking this to him?

05:59.653 --> 06:01.485
Did you think that far
down the road?

06:01.553 --> 06:03.187
Well, if you were
a different kind of person

06:03.255 --> 06:04.689
that part
wouldn't be difficult.

06:04.757 --> 06:06.658
What does that mean,
"different kind of person"?

06:06.725 --> 06:08.826
The kind of person
that has an ounce of empathy

06:08.894 --> 06:11.763
for a kid who's grown up
with a fantasy for a father.

06:14.933 --> 06:17.034
You built the fantasy,
not me.

06:53.102 --> 06:54.402
No.

06:55.270 --> 06:56.738
No, you can get your shirt
out of a knot,

06:56.806 --> 07:00.175
because all my plans
for California and Big River

07:00.242 --> 07:02.310
<i>are all on ice.</i>

07:02.377 --> 07:03.644
Which is why
I came over here

07:03.713 --> 07:05.278
to talk to you...

07:05.346 --> 07:08.381
Because you don't
answer your phone.

07:08.449 --> 07:10.517
What's with that?
You won't take my calls.

07:10.585 --> 07:13.721
Sometimes I don't wanna
talk to you.

07:13.788 --> 07:15.823
So, all your big plans
are out the window,

07:15.890 --> 07:17.091
are they?

07:17.158 --> 07:19.426
I'm curious.
Was it something I said?

07:19.493 --> 07:22.328
No. Extenuating circumstances.

07:22.395 --> 07:23.462
Care to expand on that?

07:25.265 --> 07:26.165
Nope.

07:26.233 --> 07:27.299
Good.

07:28.836 --> 07:29.902
Hi, Lou!

07:30.170 --> 07:31.370
Lou:
Dad.

07:31.538 --> 07:34.107
Well, if you stick around
a few more weeks,

07:34.174 --> 07:37.508
you might actually see this
grandchild of yours arrive.

07:37.576 --> 07:38.877
I know Janice might not see

07:38.945 --> 07:40.946
quite how important
that is for me, but...

07:41.013 --> 07:43.648
Oh no, Janice isn't
pulling any strings.

07:43.716 --> 07:45.751
So, I hear she's in California.

07:45.818 --> 07:47.085
Is she looking for a ranch?

07:47.153 --> 07:48.586
No. She's racing.

07:48.654 --> 07:50.856
Without you?
What's with that?

07:50.923 --> 07:53.157
Well, like I told
your grandfather,

07:53.225 --> 07:55.860
our plans have been
put on hold.

07:56.795 --> 07:59.130
Any plans I've ever made
have been put on hold.

07:59.197 --> 08:01.799
Well, I'm sorry
to inconvenience you.

08:01.867 --> 08:02.967
Where is Peter?

08:03.034 --> 08:03.968
Napping.

08:04.035 --> 08:05.069
(Snickers)

08:05.137 --> 08:06.703
Napping?
<i>Jack: Mm-hm.</i>

08:06.772 --> 08:09.038
I'm the one who's pregnant;
I should be napping!

08:09.106 --> 08:10.907
Says he's can't sleep
at night.

08:10.975 --> 08:12.876
(Sighs) Who can?

08:12.943 --> 08:14.510
You look great, honey.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.613
Mm!

08:17.681 --> 08:19.149
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>I've had a bad morning.</i>

08:19.216 --> 08:22.051
I spilled pomegranate juice
all over myself,

08:22.119 --> 08:23.519
and I left the keys
in the truck

08:23.587 --> 08:25.520
with the truck open.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.990
And I can't even fit behind
the steering wheel anymore.

08:28.057 --> 08:29.591
Hey, honey, I told you
I would've driven you.

08:29.659 --> 08:30.759
(Huffs, unhappy)

08:30.827 --> 08:32.059
And none of my clothes
fit anymore

08:32.128 --> 08:34.863
and I look ugly...

08:34.931 --> 08:36.832
- No you don't.
- Yes I do!

08:36.900 --> 08:38.667
And my back is killing me

08:38.734 --> 08:40.402
and this baby seems
to wanna push my ribs

08:40.469 --> 08:42.135
right out of my body!

08:42.203 --> 08:43.604
Oh! Oh, and...

08:43.672 --> 08:46.607
The doctor said I have two
or three weeks left;

08:46.675 --> 08:48.276
I thought I only had
one week left.

08:48.343 --> 08:49.811
I've had it!

08:49.878 --> 08:51.644
I can't even bend down
to shave my legs.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.449
I'll shave your legs
for you.

08:56.517 --> 08:58.384
You will?

08:58.452 --> 09:01.354
(Welling up)
That's so sweet.

09:01.422 --> 09:03.356
Oh my God,
I'm crying again.

09:03.424 --> 09:05.325
Why am I crying?

09:06.294 --> 09:07.259
(Sniffles)

09:07.327 --> 09:09.494
- Why am I crying?
- It's okay.

09:12.398 --> 09:13.532
<i>Shane:</i>
<i>Hey, Tim!</i>

09:13.599 --> 09:15.167
Come and watch me!

09:15.235 --> 09:16.836
Amy's teaching me to ride

09:16.903 --> 09:18.570

09:19.672 --> 09:20.840
Come on now.

Whoa, girl. Whoa!

09:51.936 --> 09:53.803
Well, that's not bad.

09:53.872 --> 09:54.971
You gotta work on it a bit,

09:55.038 --> 09:56.572
but it's pretty good
for a beginner.

09:56.639 --> 09:58.274
I'm not a beginner anymore.

09:58.342 --> 10:00.376
Maybe yesterday,
but not today.

10:03.713 --> 10:05.814

some roping lessons?

10:05.883 --> 10:07.416
Yeah, maybe later.

10:09.186 --> 10:12.453

staring at me like that.

10:12.521 --> 10:15.523
<i>I'm not moving</i>

10:15.591 --> 10:18.159

10:20.897 --> 10:22.663
That's my theory.

10:22.731 --> 10:24.565
Amy:
And what's that?

10:25.667 --> 10:27.234
My mom...

10:27.302 --> 10:30.437
I think she has a thing
for your dad.

Val:
So the application is in?

10:36.477 --> 10:38.946
Yup!
I sent it in yesterday.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.080
You're doing
the right thing.

10:40.148 --> 10:41.581
Oh, I hope so.

10:41.649 --> 10:43.116
I'm really gonna miss Caleb.

10:43.183 --> 10:46.152
Honey, long distance
relationships can work.

10:46.220 --> 10:47.320
You know what they say
about absence

10:47.388 --> 10:48.854
making the heart
grow fonder.

10:48.923 --> 10:50.723
I don't know about that.

10:50.791 --> 10:52.458
Caleb's pretty upset
about it.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.793

<i>Yeah, well...</i>

10:53.860 --> 10:55.461
He'll support you,
and I know he will.

10:55.529 --> 10:57.630
You two can make this work.

10:57.697 --> 10:59.064
You've already been through
so much

10:59.132 --> 11:01.333
and you've always landed
on your feet, right?

11:01.401 --> 11:02.734
Thanks, mom.

11:02.802 --> 11:06.704
I'm very proud of you.
You know that.

11:06.772 --> 11:07.940
Now, you're gonna need

11:08.007 --> 11:09.908
a whole new wardrobe
for school.

11:09.976 --> 11:11.944
What do you say
we go do some damage?

11:12.011 --> 11:13.412
Come on.

11:14.613 --> 11:17.614
What makes you think
that your mom likes my dad?

11:17.682 --> 11:20.918
Shane: Well, you know, he's
visited us a lot of times.

11:20.986 --> 11:22.987
Visited?
Like at the dude ranch?

11:23.055 --> 11:24.322
Yeah.

11:24.389 --> 11:26.824
He and my mom spent hours
talking in the cabin.

11:26.891 --> 11:30.261
I think they bonded
when I stole his truck.

11:30.329 --> 11:32.062
Bonded. Really.

11:32.129 --> 11:33.296
Yeah.

11:33.364 --> 11:35.198
And, you know,
if they get together,

11:35.266 --> 11:36.732
I guess it wouldn't be
too bad.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.901
I mean, I'd never have
to leave here, right?

11:41.305 --> 11:43.173
Yeah.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.907
Mallory:
So, you should all know,

11:44.976 --> 11:46.943
I quit my job at Maggie's.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.378
Actually, Soraya fired me
for reasons I still question.

11:49.446 --> 11:51.347
But long story short,
I'm back.

11:51.414 --> 11:52.781
And we're glad you are.

11:52.849 --> 11:54.350
We missed you, kiddo.

11:54.417 --> 11:56.918
Well, that's good news
because I have a proposition.

11:56.987 --> 11:58.920
I propose that I come back
to work at Heartland

11:58.989 --> 12:01.590
and I will deal with the horses
and my chores.

12:01.657 --> 12:02.924
<i>Plus, on top of that,</i>

12:02.992 --> 12:04.158
<i>I'll help Lou with the baby</i>
<i>as well.</i>

12:04.226 --> 12:05.693
Really?

12:05.760 --> 12:07.095
Yeah, I mean,
I love babies

12:07.162 --> 12:09.097
and I know you guys
don't want a full-time nanny.

12:09.164 --> 12:10.431
More to the point,

12:10.499 --> 12:11.899
you guys can't afford
a full-time nanny.

12:11.967 --> 12:14.435
So... I'm a pretty good find.

12:15.570 --> 12:17.071
Okay... I guess.

12:17.139 --> 12:18.572
You guess?

12:18.640 --> 12:19.906
Lou, you should be
jumping at this chance.

12:19.974 --> 12:21.674
We can see how it works.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.310
Thank you.

12:23.378 --> 12:26.579
Okay, so I am totally prepared
for this whole birth thing

12:26.647 --> 12:28.482
you guys are about
to go through, okay?

12:28.549 --> 12:31.018
Unfortunately,
the third trimester...

12:31.085 --> 12:33.053
Hate to tell you,
but it's gonna be the worst.

12:33.121 --> 12:34.888
So here's what
you should expect:

12:34.955 --> 12:36.389
Fatigue and trouble sleeping,

12:36.456 --> 12:38.157
leg cramps, heartburn,
constipation,

12:38.225 --> 12:40.393
<i>backache, bleeding gums,</i>
<i>bladder issues, moodiness,</i>

12:40.460 --> 12:43.529
faintness, forgetfulness,
decreased lie-bido/libido...

12:43.596 --> 12:45.864
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Mallory, thanks.</i>

12:45.932 --> 12:47.533
Mallory:
Okay, yes.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.202
The possible side effects,
honey.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.370
Yeah.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.973
Amy:
Hey. How was your exam?

12:56.042 --> 12:57.208
Ty:
Oh, it was good.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.576
I barely made it.

12:58.644 --> 13:01.379
With seconds to spare,
I just snuck in the door.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.349
But I think I did all right.

13:05.984 --> 13:07.384
Hmm...

13:07.452 --> 13:12.122
You uh...
You looking for this?

13:12.190 --> 13:15.059
Oh, thank you!
I thought I lost it!

13:15.126 --> 13:17.428
You missed a text.
From Blair.

13:19.264 --> 13:20.764
Okay, I wasn't gonna
say anything,

13:20.831 --> 13:23.632
but why is she texting you?

13:23.700 --> 13:24.833
How should I know?

13:24.901 --> 13:26.369
I I know we're not together
anymore

13:26.437 --> 13:28.171
and I know it's none
of my business...

13:28.238 --> 13:30.005
You know that I would never
get involved with Blair

13:30.074 --> 13:32.508
on any level again, right?

13:32.576 --> 13:34.343
What do I have to do
to get you past this?

13:34.411 --> 13:35.378
I am past it.

13:35.446 --> 13:36.412
Well, then what's
the big deal?

13:36.480 --> 13:38.114
I was just curious as to...

13:38.182 --> 13:42.517
Mrs. Bell: (Clears throat)
I have some herbs for Lou.

13:42.585 --> 13:44.386
<i>They make a marvelous tea</i>

13:44.454 --> 13:46.555
<i>and it helps with sleeping</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

13:46.622 --> 13:48.756
She's due any minute
isn't she?

13:48.824 --> 13:50.092
Yeah.
In a few weeks.

13:51.394 --> 13:53.528
You got a minute to talk?

13:53.596 --> 13:54.996
Uh, yeah.

13:55.930 --> 13:58.399
I'll give these to Lou.

14:03.632 --> 14:05.833
I've spent the last couple
of months in Florida,

14:05.834 --> 14:07.101
but when I got back

14:07.169 --> 14:09.169
I didn't like the rumours
I was hearing;

14:09.237 --> 14:11.972
That you weren't going
to your university classes.

14:12.039 --> 14:13.406
Mrs. Bell...

14:13.474 --> 14:15.876
That you changed your mind
about being a vet.

14:15.943 --> 14:18.245
I gave you the money
for your university education

14:18.312 --> 14:19.246
in good faith

14:19.313 --> 14:20.413
and if all this is true,

14:20.481 --> 14:22.382
then you've betrayed
my trust!

14:22.449 --> 14:25.484
I got off track,
but I'm back.

14:25.551 --> 14:28.220
I'm going to school now,
I just had an exam today.

14:28.288 --> 14:30.222
I'm working with Scott again.

14:30.290 --> 14:32.191
I'm fine.

14:32.259 --> 14:34.459
And I would never betray
your trust.

14:34.527 --> 14:36.896
Oh. So, uh...

14:36.963 --> 14:39.831
You got off track, did you?

14:39.900 --> 14:41.065
Nothing at all
to do with the fact

14:41.133 --> 14:42.733
that you and Amy broke up?

14:42.801 --> 14:45.937
<i>Don't think I didn't hear</i>
<i>that rumour either.</i>

14:46.005 --> 14:47.305
Remember what I told you

14:47.373 --> 14:50.375
about the two of you
being a good match?

14:50.442 --> 14:52.110
<i>I meant it.</i>

14:52.177 --> 14:53.378
Well, it's not that simple.

14:53.445 --> 14:56.047
(Huffs) Who said it was?

14:59.784 --> 15:01.718
Horses are prey animals.

15:01.786 --> 15:05.154
Their instincts are
flight or fight.

15:05.222 --> 15:07.156
You're a bit like that.

15:07.224 --> 15:09.492
You need to stop fleeing

15:09.560 --> 15:11.227
and get a little more
of that fight back.

15:11.295 --> 15:14.597
I know it's in you,
I've seen it.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.869
Oh! Well,
will you look at that.

15:20.837 --> 15:23.605
<i>Sugarfoot's made a friend.</i>

15:30.914 --> 15:32.581
No, no.

15:32.649 --> 15:34.950
Nothing's been worked out.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.485
No, I can't join you
right now.

15:37.553 --> 15:38.920
Janice?

15:38.987 --> 15:40.688
Hello?

15:40.756 --> 15:41.823
Agh!

15:42.758 --> 15:45.025
Son of a... hey!

15:45.093 --> 15:47.428
Amy gave me this.
Can you help me out?

15:47.496 --> 15:49.464
'Cause I suck!

15:49.531 --> 15:51.766
Maybe later.
Is your mother in here?

15:51.834 --> 15:54.434
Yeah, she's in the cabin.

15:54.502 --> 15:56.703
(Cabin door opens
and closes)

15:57.672 --> 15:59.005
Tim:
I'm, ah...

16:00.875 --> 16:04.811
I'm sorry that I wasn't
a little more, uh...

16:04.879 --> 16:06.312
Empathetic.

16:07.782 --> 16:09.281
I was in shock.

16:10.249 --> 16:12.685
Why didn't you tell me
that you were pregnant?

16:12.752 --> 16:14.186
Can I be blunt?

16:15.154 --> 16:18.156
You weren't fit
to be a father back then.

16:18.224 --> 16:20.559
Listen, I wasn't
much better myself,

16:20.627 --> 16:22.227
and...

16:22.295 --> 16:24.529
Our relationship
wasn't exactly wonderful

16:24.597 --> 16:26.598
while it lasted.

16:26.665 --> 16:29.634
Anyway, I didn't want
or need your help.

16:29.702 --> 16:31.369
I pulled my act together,
I got through it,

16:31.436 --> 16:34.338
and I'm proud of myself.

16:34.406 --> 16:36.541
Well, you should be.

16:36.609 --> 16:39.811
You did a pretty good job
of raising that kid

16:39.879 --> 16:40.978
and it must've been hard.

16:41.045 --> 16:42.178
It was.

16:44.048 --> 16:45.716
Anyway, um...

16:46.784 --> 16:48.919
I've made a decision.

16:49.888 --> 16:52.455
This was a bad idea.

16:52.524 --> 16:54.224
You're obviously
not interested

16:54.291 --> 16:55.826
in being any kind
of a role model

16:55.894 --> 16:57.292
<i>and if that's the case,</i>

16:57.360 --> 16:58.995
<i>i don't want Shane</i>
<i>to get too attached.</i>

16:59.062 --> 17:01.196
I mean,
he probably already is.

17:01.264 --> 17:05.267
So, um...
we're gonna go home.

17:05.335 --> 17:06.636
No.

17:06.703 --> 17:07.970
I know he's having
the time of his life,

17:08.038 --> 17:10.105
but I can't let him
get used to this.

17:10.173 --> 17:11.607
Just... stay.

17:11.675 --> 17:13.074
No, we're gonna go.

17:14.577 --> 17:15.644
Stay.

17:17.212 --> 17:21.115
At least for as long
as you had planned.

17:23.019 --> 17:24.419
You mean that?

17:25.820 --> 17:27.121
Stay.

17:34.328 --> 17:35.462
(Door closes)

17:37.032 --> 17:39.299
Hey!
How's it going?

17:39.834 --> 17:41.134
Shane:
Okay, I guess.

17:41.202 --> 17:43.037
Here, let me show you
how it's done.

17:45.806 --> 17:47.306
You're looking good.
Thanks.

17:47.374 --> 17:49.275
Just build up the loop,

17:49.342 --> 17:51.678
but you gotta keep
your elbow up.

17:51.745 --> 17:55.114
Okay. It's like throwing
a baseball or a football.

17:55.182 --> 17:56.382
You're elbow's gotta be up

17:56.450 --> 17:57.516
and you gotta finish
at the target.

17:57.585 --> 17:58.885
Let's see it.

17:58.953 --> 18:01.486
You know, my dad
was a rodeo cowboy.

18:01.554 --> 18:03.321
Apparently,
he was really good.

18:03.389 --> 18:05.624
<i>I wanna get just as good</i>
<i>as him</i>

18:05.692 --> 18:07.258
<i>and I will.</i>

18:07.326 --> 18:08.526
Well, that's...

18:08.595 --> 18:11.063
That's why you gotta
practice a lot.

18:12.665 --> 18:14.900
Okay. Here goes the steer
outta the chute.

18:16.768 --> 18:19.236
<i>Let's see</i>
<i>what the kid's got!</i>

18:19.304 --> 18:21.872
<i>Oh, hey!</i>
<i>We got a new rodeo champ!</i>

18:23.041 --> 18:26.143
<i>A little cowboy</i>
<i>from Fort St. John.</i>

18:26.211 --> 18:27.244
<i>Hey! Woo!</i>

18:31.617 --> 18:33.850
(Groans and exhales)

18:38.322 --> 18:39.522
Lou!

18:39.590 --> 18:41.024
- Hey.
- What're you doing, sweetheart?

18:41.092 --> 18:42.358
Come back to bed.

18:42.426 --> 18:44.560
You try sleeping
with a 20 pound toaster

18:44.629 --> 18:46.129
tied to your stomach.

18:46.196 --> 18:47.130
I'm itchy

18:47.197 --> 18:49.632
and I can't get comfortable.

18:49.666 --> 18:51.233
How am I ever going
to be rested up

18:51.300 --> 18:52.835
for this baby?

18:53.770 --> 18:55.270
You...

18:55.338 --> 18:57.773
(Whispers) Need to relax.

18:57.841 --> 19:00.475
I just can't help
thinking that...

19:00.543 --> 19:01.810
What?

19:03.813 --> 19:08.182
What if not everybody
is cut out to be a mother?

19:08.250 --> 19:09.917
Hey.

19:09.985 --> 19:11.285
You're gonna be
a great mother.

19:11.353 --> 19:13.554
But I might not be.

19:13.622 --> 19:15.723
What's wrong with me?

19:15.791 --> 19:17.191
Come here.

19:18.627 --> 19:20.561
Be careful.
I might break the chair.

19:20.629 --> 19:22.763
(Laughs) Come here.

19:26.367 --> 19:27.500
(Moans)

19:28.369 --> 19:29.703
Listen to me.

19:30.604 --> 19:33.874
There is nothing wrong
with you.

19:34.308 --> 19:36.143
Are you scared?

19:37.343 --> 19:40.746
Yeah.
Sure I'm scared.

19:40.814 --> 19:44.249
But I am gonna be with you
every step of the way.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.250
Lou:
Okay.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.385
Peter:
'Kay.

19:56.295 --> 19:57.528
So I guess your mom's
pretty happy

19:57.596 --> 19:59.831
about the whole situation.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.968
Yeah, she is, naturally.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.838
I mean, she always wanted me
to go back to school.

20:09.107 --> 20:10.207
I bet she'll be
a whole lot happier

20:10.274 --> 20:12.109
when you're away from me.

20:13.044 --> 20:15.212
That's not fair!

20:15.279 --> 20:18.082
Why do you always
see the worst in her?

20:18.149 --> 20:20.150
You're the one
who's being selfish.

20:20.218 --> 20:21.852
I'm being selfish?

20:21.920 --> 20:23.987
Your mom is the one
being selfish.

20:24.055 --> 20:25.321
She got everything
she wanted,

20:25.388 --> 20:27.389
and everything she hoped for
is happening.

20:27.457 --> 20:28.490
Oh, that's really nice.

20:28.558 --> 20:30.159
Oh, Ash, please!

20:31.128 --> 20:32.762
Please don't go.

20:33.663 --> 20:34.764
Please?

20:51.147 --> 20:53.181
(File rasps)

20:56.752 --> 20:57.785
Hey.

20:58.787 --> 20:59.887
(File rasps)

21:00.822 --> 21:01.889
Okay.

21:04.025 --> 21:05.325
This is awkward.

21:05.393 --> 21:06.560
Do you feel the same as me?

21:06.628 --> 21:07.694
That there's all this
stuff floating around

21:07.763 --> 21:09.029
that we haven't said,

21:09.097 --> 21:12.532
or we should have said,
or...

21:17.437 --> 21:21.374
I just...
I think about...

21:21.441 --> 21:24.177
Look what she's done to us.

21:24.245 --> 21:26.712
We did it to ourselves.

21:28.582 --> 21:31.183
I can't go down
that same road again, Amy.

21:31.251 --> 21:33.051
<i>I won't.</i>

21:33.119 --> 21:34.186
Okay.

21:36.455 --> 21:39.557
If we don't put this whole
Chase-Blair thing behind us,

21:39.625 --> 21:40.759
we might as well call off

21:40.827 --> 21:42.094
any chance of us
being friends

21:42.162 --> 21:43.561
or anything else.

21:44.530 --> 21:46.030
<i>You know,</i>
<i>you spend a lot of time</i>

21:46.098 --> 21:48.099
<i>building trust with</i>
<i>the horses you work with.</i>

21:49.935 --> 21:53.504
If you can't trust me
and I can't trust you,

21:53.571 --> 21:55.639
what do we got?

21:56.608 --> 21:59.811
Trusting is just hard
right now.

22:00.812 --> 22:01.845
I know.

22:03.347 --> 22:06.283
But that's what
it's gonna take.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.168
Don't stand in front
of them like that, Amy.

22:14.169 --> 22:15.670
Jack: - They might bolt.
Amy: - All right, all right!

22:15.737 --> 22:17.371
But this guy
just keeps pushing me.

22:17.438 --> 22:20.307
(Neighs and snorts)

22:20.375 --> 22:22.875
Jack: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Ease off! Oh, miseries!

22:22.978 --> 22:24.645
(Exhales, exhausted) Lisa,

22:24.713 --> 22:25.946
are you sure these guys

22:26.014 --> 22:27.514
have been hitched up
together before?

22:27.582 --> 22:30.150
<i>'Cause it's just my guess,</i>

22:30.217 --> 22:32.351
as pretty as they are,
they're both gree- oh!

22:33.487 --> 22:35.488
Jack: Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Lisa: Jack!

22:36.423 --> 22:38.158
Lisa: Oh no!
(Trying to stifle a laugh)

22:39.093 --> 22:40.193
<i>Oh, honey!</i>

22:40.260 --> 22:41.494
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Grandpa!</i>

22:41.562 --> 22:42.862
(Slow, steady breaths)

22:43.548 --> 22:45.915
Okay, but a bit slower,
okay?

22:46.850 --> 22:48.383
Okay.

22:48.452 --> 22:49.685
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm honestly...

22:49.753 --> 22:50.719
I'm just trying to do
what you told me...

22:50.787 --> 22:51.821
well, but if you breathe
that fast

22:51.888 --> 22:53.121
I'm gonna faint.

22:53.189 --> 22:55.891
Like, you can't breathe
that fast.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.861
Okay, like I said,
I'm just doing...

22:58.929 --> 22:59.962
I'm sorry, I'm trying.
I'm just trying...

23:00.029 --> 23:01.930
No, you know what?
It's...

23:01.997 --> 23:04.165
You should have been invested
in this a long time ago

23:04.232 --> 23:07.068
'cause it looks easy, honey,
but it isn't.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.003
So, let's just...

23:09.071 --> 23:10.772
I can't expect you
to get this all

23:10.840 --> 23:11.773
at the last minute.

23:11.841 --> 23:13.575
Let's just give it a pass.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.242
We don't have to...

23:15.310 --> 23:17.810
<i>Lou:</i> <i>Don't worry about it.
</i> <i>Just forget it.</i>

23:23.250 --> 23:24.918
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>Just so you know,</i>

23:24.986 --> 23:28.088
it says here that expectant
fathers may feel alienated

23:28.155 --> 23:30.156
because they're not sure
what role they can play.

23:30.224 --> 23:31.391
So it says it's really
important for you

23:31.459 --> 23:33.359
to communicate
with your partner.

23:33.426 --> 23:35.094
This will strengthen bonds

23:35.161 --> 23:36.095
and help in being

23:36.162 --> 23:37.196
a good support during labour

23:37.263 --> 23:38.631
and after birth.

23:41.401 --> 23:43.536
Thank you, Mallory.

23:45.338 --> 23:47.740
Yeah.
I'm here for ya.

23:49.341 --> 23:50.542
Okay, Bonnie,

23:50.610 --> 23:52.110
we're gonna get this right
this time.

23:52.177 --> 23:54.913
Clyde, keep it together...
both of you.

23:59.986 --> 24:01.352
(Clicks teeth) Come on.

24:01.420 --> 24:02.487
(Grunts and snorts)

24:07.358 --> 24:08.993
<i>Come on, come on.</i>
<i>(Clucks tongue)</i>

24:09.060 --> 24:10.193
<i>Go!</i>

24:10.261 --> 24:13.363
Bonnie and Clyde:
(Nicker and whinny)

24:13.431 --> 24:15.365
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Amy, hold on!</i>

24:16.300 --> 24:17.701
Hey, looks like you could
use a hand there.

24:17.769 --> 24:19.336
Ty, I got it!
I'm fine!

24:19.404 --> 24:20.937
Lisa hired me
to do this job, okay?!

24:21.005 --> 24:22.171
Ty:
I know, I know!

24:22.239 --> 24:23.439
Amy:
No, just let me!

24:23.507 --> 24:24.741
Ty, you're not helping.

24:24.808 --> 24:25.775
These guys are pretty big

24:25.843 --> 24:26.709
for you to handle
on your own.

24:26.777 --> 24:27.911
- Ty, keep it even.
- I am!

24:27.978 --> 24:30.413
Amy: - Keep it even!
Ty: - I am!

24:30.480 --> 24:32.715
Amy:
Look, I got it, okay?

24:36.253 --> 24:37.419
<i>Come on, you two!</i>

24:37.486 --> 24:39.387
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Yeah. That's working.</i>

24:39.455 --> 24:40.689
(Horse grunts)

24:42.625 --> 24:44.693
Ty:
I'm just trying to help, Amy.

24:44.761 --> 24:46.662
Amy: - Well, you're not.
Ty: - Okay, do it yourself.

24:46.729 --> 24:48.964
<i>Mrs. Bell:</i> <i>You two are</i>
the most stubborn mules

24:49.032 --> 24:51.099
I have ever met.

24:51.167 --> 24:53.601
These horses are picking up
on your stress!

24:53.669 --> 24:55.302
I don't have to be
a horse whisperer

24:55.370 --> 24:56.671
<i>to figure that out.</i>

24:56.738 --> 24:59.740
(Sugarfoot whinnies,
Clydesdale nickers)

25:01.443 --> 25:03.410
Mrs. Bell:
Whoa, boy! Whoa, boy!

25:03.478 --> 25:04.779
<i>Where do you think</i>
<i>you're going?</i>

25:04.846 --> 25:05.780
<i>Whoa!</i>

25:05.847 --> 25:06.814
(Whinnies)

25:06.882 --> 25:07.949
(Nickers)

25:12.252 --> 25:14.353
<i>Mrs. Bell:</i>
<i>Ah-ha! Yes!</i>

25:14.421 --> 25:16.222
Ty:
Hey, there we go.

25:17.658 --> 25:18.692
Amy:
(Laughs)

25:20.327 --> 25:22.462
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Look at him go!</i>

25:24.031 --> 25:27.265
Mrs. Bell:
Oh, it's a good, Sugarfoot.

25:28.868 --> 25:30.135
Amy:
Thanks, Mrs. Bell!

25:30.203 --> 25:31.637
It was totally amazing.

25:31.705 --> 25:33.438
You should've seen them
copying Sugarfoot

25:33.506 --> 25:35.040
while he pulled
his little cart.

25:35.108 --> 25:37.009
I mean, they're finally
figuring it out.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.276
Lou:
Yeah, Mrs. Bell told me

25:38.344 --> 25:40.378
you and Ty were the ones
figuring it out.

25:40.446 --> 25:41.646
Excuse me?

25:41.747 --> 25:42.814
What's going on there?

25:42.881 --> 25:44.048
Nothing.

25:44.116 --> 25:47.451
God!
You are such a bad liar.

25:47.519 --> 25:52.189
Jack: So, tomorrow I have go
into Calgary with Lisa,

25:53.125 --> 25:55.292
pick up a few things
for the...

25:55.360 --> 25:57.027
For the fair.

25:58.830 --> 26:00.430
Okay, um...

26:00.498 --> 26:02.165
Then I'll stick around here
tomorrow then.

26:02.233 --> 26:03.166
Why, what's up?

26:03.234 --> 26:04.300
Ah, nothing.
I was gonna...

26:04.368 --> 26:05.435
I was supposed to meet
this guy for lunch,

26:05.503 --> 26:06.837
in Edmonton.

26:06.904 --> 26:08.304
It's a job opportunity
possibility kind of thing.

26:08.372 --> 26:09.673
But I'm not gonna...
I won't go now.

26:09.741 --> 26:11.374
Are you kidding me?
Go!

26:11.442 --> 26:14.209
No, honey. I'm not gonna
leave you alone like this.

26:14.277 --> 26:17.079
Don't be silly.
I'm not due for weeks.

26:17.147 --> 26:18.648
Go meet the guy.

26:18.715 --> 26:19.915
Besides,
you probably can't wait

26:19.983 --> 26:21.517
to get a little time
away from me.

26:21.584 --> 26:23.686
(Stammers) That's not true.

26:23.754 --> 26:25.655
But, um, I'm gonna call him.

26:25.722 --> 26:28.290
You know, I'll leave early,
I'll be back early.

26:28.358 --> 26:29.490
(Half laughs)

26:39.802 --> 26:41.269
I'm glad you called.

26:41.336 --> 26:44.205
I've been wanting to tell you
how wonderful I think it is

26:44.273 --> 26:47.708
that you're backing Ashley
through all of this.

26:47.776 --> 26:49.910
It takes a big man.

26:51.212 --> 26:53.413
Yeah, it does.

26:53.481 --> 26:56.383
I just wish the school
was a little closer to home.

26:56.450 --> 26:58.585
Well, you'll get used
to that.

26:58.653 --> 27:00.953
I guess Italy
really opened Ashley's eyes.

27:01.021 --> 27:03.823
(Chuckles) Something had to.

27:03.891 --> 27:06.025
Can I ask you something?

27:06.093 --> 27:09.528
Our honeymoon,
it was amazing, but...

27:10.497 --> 27:14.834
It's just starting to feel
like it was less of a gift

27:14.902 --> 27:16.602
and more of a plan.

27:16.670 --> 27:17.903
A plan?

27:17.970 --> 27:20.371
Yeah. Like maybe
you were hoping

27:20.439 --> 27:22.708
Ashley would see
what her life could be

27:22.775 --> 27:25.310
instead of what it is.

27:25.377 --> 27:27.478
Maybe that's why
you joined us in Italy...

27:27.546 --> 27:30.182
keep her there longer.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.416
<i>I mean, you were</i>
<i>really counting on her</i>

27:31.483 --> 27:33.918
falling in love
with that Marco guy, right?

27:33.985 --> 27:35.820
Or at least with some rich
and famous lifestyle

27:35.887 --> 27:37.387
that I cannot give her?

27:37.455 --> 27:40.524
Boy, you're unbelievable.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.628
I've done everything
in my power

27:44.696 --> 27:46.330
to try to be positive

27:46.397 --> 27:49.532
about my daughter's
marriage to you.

27:49.600 --> 27:53.669
I have gone out of my way
to try to be understanding

27:53.738 --> 27:56.239
and this is what I get?

28:08.251 --> 28:10.352
(Gasps)

28:14.023 --> 28:17.025
In the next couple of weeks
your diet is very important.

28:17.093 --> 28:18.526
Oh man!

28:18.594 --> 28:19.862
Lou?

28:19.929 --> 28:21.428
(Forceful exhale)

28:21.496 --> 28:23.831
I've been having
these weird cramps.

28:23.899 --> 28:26.868
Okay, it's probably just
Braxton-Hicks contraction.

28:26.935 --> 28:28.970
Totally normal at this time.

28:29.037 --> 28:30.838
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Oh my God!</i>

28:32.274 --> 28:34.142
Okay, that's definitely
not Braxton-Hicks.

28:35.543 --> 28:36.710
Ty:
That worked out pretty well.

28:36.778 --> 28:38.711
Amy:
Yeah. Even without Sugarfoot.

28:38.780 --> 28:40.380
(Laughs)

28:40.447 --> 28:42.816
Hey, Ty,
thank you for your help.

28:43.717 --> 28:44.885
No problem.

28:45.820 --> 28:47.821
Can I just say one thing

28:47.889 --> 28:50.290
about the whole
Chase-Blair thing?

28:50.357 --> 28:51.691
Amy, you're driving me
crazy!

28:51.759 --> 28:53.425
I know.
I promise I'll let it go.

28:53.493 --> 28:54.693
It's just...

28:55.628 --> 28:57.362
You know,
it's like you said.

28:57.430 --> 28:59.165
I know it wasn't just Blair
who broke us up,

28:59.232 --> 29:02.134
it was a bit of Chase too.

29:02.202 --> 29:05.938
And I did like him.
A little.

29:06.006 --> 29:07.773
But, Ty,
that's gonna happen;

29:07.841 --> 29:11.342
We're gonna be attracted
to other people.

29:12.278 --> 29:14.612
So what are you saying?

29:14.680 --> 29:17.148
I don't know.
I guess I'm...

29:17.216 --> 29:20.785
I'm just trying to say
that we should be...

29:20.853 --> 29:23.922
Try to be a little more
understanding.

29:23.989 --> 29:25.422
'Cause we're not perfect;
We never will be.

29:25.489 --> 29:26.456
No one is.

29:26.524 --> 29:29.126
Speak for yourself.
(Laughs)

29:30.962 --> 29:32.562
Yeah, right.
(Laughs)

29:32.630 --> 29:36.766
(Amy's cell rings)

29:37.568 --> 29:39.569
Mallory, what's up?

29:40.538 --> 29:42.171
Yeah, yeah!
We're coming. Coming!

29:42.638 --> 29:43.571
What?

29:45.508 --> 29:46.575
Lou?!

29:47.510 --> 29:49.045
Okay, I have everything
in hand.

29:49.112 --> 29:51.214
Her water just broke but her
contractions are miles apart.

29:51.281 --> 29:52.248
I've read all about this

29:52.316 --> 29:54.016
and there's nothing
to worry about.

29:54.084 --> 29:55.351
We just have to get her
to the hospital.

29:55.418 --> 29:56.685
Apparently she's been
having contractions

29:56.753 --> 29:58.153
since the middle
of the night.

29:58.221 --> 29:59.487
Oh my God.

29:59.555 --> 30:01.456
Lou, why didn't you
say anything?

30:01.523 --> 30:05.260
Why? Because grampa and Lisa
had to go to Calgary,

30:05.328 --> 30:07.095
and Peter had
his appointment

30:07.163 --> 30:08.496
and it was important.

30:08.564 --> 30:10.732
No, that's not important!

30:10.799 --> 30:12.200
Yes, it is.
And besides,

30:12.268 --> 30:13.800
what if this was
another false labour?

30:13.869 --> 30:15.269
I did not want to go
through that again.

30:15.337 --> 30:17.371
It was so embarrassing.

30:17.438 --> 30:18.772
Oh my God!

30:18.840 --> 30:20.207
Amy: Okay, this isn't
a false labour.

30:20.275 --> 30:21.842
That contraction was way
too close to the last one.

30:21.910 --> 30:22.809
<i>Ty:</i> <i>Okay, we're gonna get
her</i> <i>to the hospital.</i>

30:22.878 --> 30:24.879
I'm gonna go get my truck.

30:25.847 --> 30:28.749
Just be calm.
Everybody stay calm.

30:30.084 --> 30:31.150
Lou:
Okay, get my coat.

30:32.586 --> 30:34.254
Okay, let's do this.

30:34.321 --> 30:35.889
Lou: - Whoa!
Ty: - It's okay. You in?

30:35.956 --> 30:36.789
Lou:
Yeah.

30:36.857 --> 30:38.557
You might wanna hurry.

30:38.625 --> 30:41.160
Ty: - Here we go!
Lou: - Step on the gas, Ty.

30:41.228 --> 30:42.762
Lou: - Okay, stop!
Ty: - What?

30:42.829 --> 30:45.097
Lou: - Turn around! Turn around!
Amy: - Lou! Lou, we can't!

30:45.164 --> 30:46.731
Lou: - The baby's coming!
Ty: - Okay, okay!

30:46.799 --> 30:48.133
Lou: - Get back to the house!
Ty: - All right. Here we go.

30:48.201 --> 30:49.768
Amy: Okay, okay. Ty!
Ty, just hurry!

30:49.835 --> 30:51.403
Ty:
Hold on.

30:51.470 --> 30:54.940
Lou: Oh my God!
(Breathes heavily and moans)

30:55.909 --> 30:57.309
<i>Mallory:</i>
Hi. Peter?

30:57.377 --> 30:58.843
Where are you?

30:58.912 --> 31:00.412
You need to get
to the hospital.

31:00.479 --> 31:02.246
Lou's having the baby.
(Front door opens and closes)

31:02.314 --> 31:03.547
Okay, bye.

31:04.482 --> 31:05.649
What are you doing here?!

31:05.717 --> 31:06.918
She's in full out labour.

31:06.985 --> 31:07.751
We never would've made it
to the hospital.

31:07.819 --> 31:09.953
Call Peter.
Call dad.

31:10.021 --> 31:11.521
Call my doctor.

31:11.588 --> 31:12.455
Valerie: I will. I did.
Everything's under control.

31:12.523 --> 31:14.157
The contractions are...

31:14.225 --> 31:15.458
It's just one weak
contraction.

31:15.526 --> 31:16.793
Okay, you need to call
an ambulance

31:16.860 --> 31:18.061
right now, okay?

31:18.129 --> 31:19.695
Lou: Oh my God,
I can't breathe!

31:19.763 --> 31:21.231
(Stressed breath)

31:22.599 --> 31:25.234
(Muttering while she dials)

31:27.237 --> 31:28.304
Aw!

31:33.176 --> 31:34.676
I think I'm getting good,
right?

31:34.744 --> 31:35.811
(Laughs)

31:36.279 --> 31:37.313
Looks like it.

31:39.782 --> 31:41.749
Well, you know what
they say?

31:41.817 --> 31:42.716
Practice...

31:42.784 --> 31:43.751
Makes perfect.

31:43.819 --> 31:45.786
Tim:
That's a good boy.

31:51.427 --> 31:54.562
(Tim's phone buzzes)

32:00.000 --> 32:02.268
We're gonna need some
freshs towels and clean sheets.

32:02.538 --> 32:03.038
Lots of them.

32:03.106 --> 32:04.473
Ty, Lou has got to go
to the hospital

32:04.475 --> 32:05.374
and she's got to go now!

32:05.442 --> 32:07.419
That's not gonna happen, Amy.
We called the ambulance.

32:07.426 --> 32:08.893
They're never gonna
make it here on time.

32:08.912 --> 32:10.512
She's having that baby now.

32:10.579 --> 32:13.014
I tried and tried Tim's cell,
he's not picking up.

32:13.081 --> 32:15.049
Lisa isn't either.
But I did get a hold of Peter

32:15.117 --> 32:16.650
and he's on his way back.
He hadn't gotten very far.

32:16.718 --> 32:17.851
Good.
That's good.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.520
Do you know
what you're doing?

32:19.587 --> 32:21.688
No, I don't.
That's why I need your help.

32:21.756 --> 32:23.791
This isn't a horse foaling.
This is my sister!

32:23.858 --> 32:25.592
I know, okay?
It's gonna be all right.

32:25.660 --> 32:27.260
How is it gonna be
all right?

32:27.328 --> 32:28.528
Mallory:
We have the book, right?

32:29.931 --> 32:30.931
We'll be fine, okay?

32:30.998 --> 32:32.065
We're gonna do this,
together.

32:32.133 --> 32:33.066
(Phone rings)

32:33.134 --> 32:34.534
Hello?

32:34.601 --> 32:37.270
Peter! Okay, yeah.
I'll put you on speakerphone.

32:37.338 --> 32:39.039
Ty:
Let's go.

32:39.106 --> 32:41.641
<i>Peter:</i> <i>Wh-what's happening?
</i> <i>Is she all right?!</i>

32:41.708 --> 32:42.909
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>Lou, it's Peter.</i>

32:42.976 --> 32:44.543
Lou:
Baby!

32:44.610 --> 32:45.377
Peter: Hey, hey, yeah.
It's m it's me. Are you okay?

32:45.445 --> 32:47.046
Where are you?

32:47.113 --> 32:48.347
<i>Peter:</i> <i>I'm on my way.
</i> <i>Just-just breathe.</i>

32:48.415 --> 32:49.415
<i>Okay? Just breathe.</i>

32:49.482 --> 32:50.515
But I am breathing!

32:50.583 --> 32:52.351
<i>Can't you hear me?</i>

32:52.419 --> 32:53.652
<i>Peter:</i> <i>Remember how we worked it out.
</i> <i>You can do this!</i>

32:53.719 --> 32:55.321
Peter: I'm with you!
Lou: I want you here now!

32:55.388 --> 32:57.423
<i>Peter:</i> <i>I will be!
I will be!</i> <i>Just breathe.</i>

32:57.490 --> 32:59.690
<i>Close your eyes.</i>
<i>Float over it...</i>

32:59.758 --> 33:01.025
Float over it...

33:01.093 --> 33:02.626
Okay, the contractions
are going to be powerful,

33:02.694 --> 33:04.128
60 to 90 seconds apart,

33:04.196 --> 33:05.896
and then you're going
to have to start pushing.

33:05.965 --> 33:07.966
Ty: Lou, we got you.
It's okay. You're okay.

33:08.033 --> 33:10.001
- Ty? - Yeah, I'm right here.
I'm right here.

33:10.069 --> 33:12.403
Peter isn't here.

33:12.471 --> 33:14.105
The ambulance isn't here.

33:14.173 --> 33:16.506
You and Amy are gonna have
to help me deliver this baby.

33:16.574 --> 33:18.275
<i>Okay? Can I trust you?</i>

33:18.343 --> 33:20.143
Ty: - Yes, you can trust us.
Lou: - I need to trust you.

33:20.211 --> 33:21.544
<i>Now this is where you say</i>

33:21.612 --> 33:24.281
everything is gonna be...
(ln pain) Okay!

33:24.349 --> 33:25.815
Oh my God!

33:25.883 --> 33:27.351
Peter: - Is she okay?
Ty: - Everything's gonna be okay.

33:27.418 --> 33:30.454
Ahh! The baby is coming,
you guys.

33:30.521 --> 33:31.753
She needs to start pushing.

33:31.821 --> 33:32.855
Lou: Okay, get this
thing off of me.

33:32.922 --> 33:34.656
It's gonna be okay.
You got it.

33:34.724 --> 33:37.193
Okay. Put your chin
to your chest

33:37.260 --> 33:38.594
and relax your tongue.

33:38.661 --> 33:40.162
Okay...

33:40.230 --> 33:42.431
Okay... You're doing great, Lou.
You're doing great.

33:42.499 --> 33:44.133
<i>Peter:</i> <i>You hear that, Lou?
</i> <i>You hear that, honey?</i>

33:44.201 --> 33:46.235
<i>You're doing great.</i>
<i>Just keep breathing. Right?</i>

33:46.303 --> 33:48.403
<i>In, out.</i>
<i>In, out.</i>

33:49.438 --> 33:51.139
Shut up, Peter!

33:51.207 --> 33:52.374
<i>Peter:</i> <i>I know, honey.
</i> <i>I know, honey.</i>

33:52.441 --> 33:53.574
<i>I know you.</i>

33:53.642 --> 33:56.211
No you do-o-on't!
(Pained cries)

33:56.278 --> 33:57.412
It's okay, Lou.
It's okay.

33:57.480 --> 33:58.746
Just keep pushing.
Keep pushing, okay?

33:59.848 --> 34:02.117
Miranda: Well, you two
are kind of bonding.

34:03.651 --> 34:06.320
He talks about you
all the time.

34:06.388 --> 34:07.721
And he loves Amy.

34:07.788 --> 34:10.290
Isn't it strange
how they hit it off?

34:10.358 --> 34:11.791
He sure loves that horse.

34:11.859 --> 34:15.496
I don't know how
I'm gonna wean him off it.

34:16.431 --> 34:19.732
Thanks for talking me
into staying.

34:19.799 --> 34:23.101
Miranda, I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

34:25.072 --> 34:27.739
I feel for your situation,

34:27.806 --> 34:30.476
but you and me,
we're strangers.

34:30.543 --> 34:31.877
Even when we spent
that few months together

34:31.945 --> 34:32.878
we were strangers.

34:32.946 --> 34:35.112
We were so high...

34:35.181 --> 34:36.880
<i>We don't remember</i>
<i>what we did,</i>

34:36.949 --> 34:38.550
where we went.

34:38.617 --> 34:40.652
But we're different now.

34:40.719 --> 34:42.154
Yeah.

34:42.221 --> 34:43.755
I am...
And I've worked damn hard

34:43.822 --> 34:45.556
to try to put my life
back together again,

34:45.623 --> 34:48.393
try to build a trust
with my daughters.

34:48.460 --> 34:50.429
<i>It's taken a long time</i>
<i>and it's still not all there,</i>

34:50.496 --> 34:52.396
<i>and I got a girlfriend.</i>

34:52.464 --> 34:53.630
<i>It is what it is.</i>

34:53.697 --> 34:55.933
I recognize that Shane
is my son,

34:56.868 --> 35:00.871
but there is not going to be
one big happy family,

35:00.939 --> 35:03.974
so let's just talk
about the money.

35:05.610 --> 35:06.777
Money?

35:07.711 --> 35:09.179
Is that what you think
this is all about?

35:09.246 --> 35:09.879
Money?!

35:09.947 --> 35:11.314
Oh, come on!

35:11.382 --> 35:14.517
You've seen Heartland,
the dude ranch,

35:14.585 --> 35:16.519
my ranch, my race horses.

35:16.587 --> 35:18.688
You've seen the money

35:18.755 --> 35:21.191
and I don't blame you
for it.

35:22.093 --> 35:23.858
Wow, you may have cleaned up

35:23.926 --> 35:26.128
but you haven't changed
one bit.

35:26.196 --> 35:29.131
You were an ass back then
and you're an ass now.

35:29.199 --> 35:30.432
<i>I didn't come here</i>
<i>for the money, Tim.</i>

35:30.500 --> 35:32.767
<i>I came to see you,</i>

35:32.835 --> 35:34.103
and for you to meet Shane

35:34.170 --> 35:37.306
and for us to see each other
again.

35:40.576 --> 35:42.743
I wanted to show you
that I cleaned up too,

35:42.811 --> 35:44.479
and that I'm a good mother.

35:46.415 --> 35:50.951
<i>And I came here to see if...</i>

35:51.019 --> 35:52.953
You might still have feelings.

35:55.856 --> 35:58.958
I thought that maybe
we could, um...

36:00.928 --> 36:04.063
But, uh, that isn't happening,
is it?

36:10.804 --> 36:12.704
I think you should go.

36:23.683 --> 36:25.050
Agh! Amy!

36:25.118 --> 36:26.118
Amy: - I think Peter's here.
Ty and Peter: - Hey.

36:26.186 --> 36:28.786
Ty: - Here, take this.
Lou: - Baby!

36:28.854 --> 36:30.955
Lou: - Baby... okay.
Peter: - You're doing amazing.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.524
<i>Ty: - You're doing great, Lou.</i>
<i>Amy: - Okay, Lou.</i>

36:32.591 --> 36:34.492
Uh, I can see the baby.
Here we go.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.693
Okay, if the baby
starts crowning,

36:35.761 --> 36:36.694
stop pushing.
No pushing.

36:36.762 --> 36:37.928
Amy:
Don't push.

36:37.996 --> 36:40.064
Mallory:
Okay, okay, just relax.

36:40.132 --> 36:42.367
Just practice
your panting breathing

36:42.434 --> 36:43.667
and just stay calm.

36:44.602 --> 36:45.802
- Uh... Mallory?!
Peter: <i>- Mallory?!</i>

36:45.870 --> 36:47.103
Um...

36:47.172 --> 36:48.738
Lou: - Amy...
Amy: - It's okay, it's okay.

36:48.806 --> 36:49.739
I don't know how to do this.

36:49.807 --> 36:50.840
It's okay, I'm right here.

36:50.908 --> 36:51.708
Gimme your hand.
Gimme your hand.

36:51.776 --> 36:52.842
Ty:
You're okay.

36:52.910 --> 36:53.777
Oh God,
this isn't happening.

36:53.844 --> 36:54.844
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Lou, push!</i>

36:59.650 --> 37:00.716
Val!

37:01.485 --> 37:03.786
Please, please.
Come on.

37:03.853 --> 37:04.987
Look, I'm really sorry

37:05.055 --> 37:06.622
about the things
I said to you.

37:06.690 --> 37:09.058
I was just mad
and I should've known

37:09.125 --> 37:11.694
you would never try
to pull something like that.

37:11.761 --> 37:12.861
I just need you to know

37:12.929 --> 37:15.297
I'm behind Ashley
all the way.

37:15.364 --> 37:17.765
In fact, I'm moving
to B.C. with her.

37:17.833 --> 37:19.568
You're going with her?

37:19.635 --> 37:21.436
Yeah.

37:21.504 --> 37:22.970
Well...
(Exhales)

37:23.038 --> 37:24.505
Caleb, is that wise?

37:24.573 --> 37:28.309
I mean, don't you have
a career here?

37:28.376 --> 37:30.878
Suddenly rodeo's a career?

37:30.946 --> 37:32.446
(Laughs uncomfortably)

37:32.514 --> 37:33.848
Well, I mean,
I'm just saying...

37:33.916 --> 37:35.382
I think that maybe Ashley

37:35.450 --> 37:37.018
could concentrate more
on her school work

37:37.086 --> 37:39.920
if you weren't there...
all the time, I mean.

37:39.987 --> 37:41.955
I know it's just
for a few years,

37:42.023 --> 37:44.124
but I need to spend
those years with Ashley,

37:44.192 --> 37:46.059
not without her.

37:46.127 --> 37:48.028
So wish us luck.

37:51.899 --> 37:54.134
<i>Peter:</i> <i>Push, honey! Push!
Push!</i> <i>You're doing it!</i>
