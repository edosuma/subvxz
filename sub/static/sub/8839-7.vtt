OH, PA.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.575
WHERE'S ALBERT?

01:58.743 --> 01:59.993
IN THE BARN.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.411
OK.

HEY, ALBERT!

02:02.914 --> 02:04.540
COME ON OUT HERE!

02:04.707 --> 02:07.960
COME ON.
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT I GOT
IN THE BACK OF THE WAGON.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.300
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

02:15.468 --> 02:18.137
OH, IT SURE IS.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.265
Albert:
LOOK AT THOSE EYES.

02:21.432 --> 02:23.725
I GOT HIM FOR YOU,
ALBERT.

02:25.812 --> 02:26.895
FOR ME?

02:27.063 --> 02:28.272
THAT'S RIGHT.

02:28.439 --> 02:31.024
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO
BE A FARMER, DIDN'T YOU?

02:31.192 --> 02:32.442
YES, SIR, I DID.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.112
THERE'S A LOT MORE TO FARMING
THAN JUST RAISING CROPS.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.072
GOT TO LEARN
ABOUT LIVESTOCK, TOO.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.616
YOU'RE GONNA RAISE
THIS YOUNG'UN.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.618
OH, YOU HEAR THAT,
LAURA?

02:41.786 --> 02:43.662
I GET TO RAISE HIM.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.122
YEAH, I HEARD.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.249

HANDLE IT?

DON'T WORRY,
MR. INGALLS.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.963
I'LL RAISE YOU
A COW TO BE PROUD OF.

02:53.131 --> 02:57.301
FIRST LESSON, ALBERT:
MALE CALVES VERY RARELY
GROW UP TO BE COWS.

02:57.468 --> 03:02.306
OH, YEAH.
THEN I WON'T EXPECT IT
TO GIVE MUCH MILK.

03:02.473 --> 03:03.640
NO. I'M AFRAID NOT.

GONNA NAME HIM?

03:22.827 --> 03:25.662
LET'S SEE...

03:25.830 --> 03:27.456
I'LL CALL HIM FAGIN.

03:27.624 --> 03:28.832
WHAT?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.418
FROM A BOOK I READ ONCE.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.920
OH, YOU MEAN
OLIVER TWIST.

03:33.087 --> 03:34.129
UH-HUH.
I LIKED IT.

03:34.297 --> 03:37.549
I SURE WOULDN'T HAVE
PICKED THAT NAME.

03:37.717 --> 03:41.345
BUT LIKE YOU SAID,
IT'S MY CALF.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.015

AS THAT CALF IS,

03:51.689 --> 03:54.358
I CAN TELL HE'S GOT
SOME GOOD BLOOD
IN HIS BACKGROUND.

03:54.525 --> 03:55.984
I STILL DON'T
UNDERSTAND, CHARLES.

03:56.152 --> 03:59.071
I MEAN, IF IT WERE
A HEIFER, WE COULD
USE THE MILK,

03:59.239 --> 04:01.031
BUT YOU'RE
NO CATTLE BREEDER.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.950
WELL, YOU REMEMBER
THOSE PICKLES AND PRESERVES

04:03.117 --> 04:05.702
YOU ENTERED
IN THE BROWN COUNTY FAIR
OVER AT SLEEPY EYE?

04:05.870 --> 04:07.537
I STILL HAVE
THE RIBBON I WON.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.539
NO REASON ALBERT
CAN'T DO JUST AS WELL
WITH A CALF.

04:09.707 --> 04:12.834
AT THE SAME TIME,
HE COULD LEARN A LOT
ABOUT LIVESTOCK.

YOU SAID, MR. INGALLS.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.798
I GAVE FAGIN
PLENTY OF HAY

04:17.966 --> 04:19.383
AND A MIXTURE
OF GRAIN AND CORN.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.510
FAGIN?

04:21.678 --> 04:23.470
YEAH.
THAT'S HIS NAME.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.056
IT WAS HIS IDEA,
NOT MINE.

04:26.224 --> 04:27.766
WELL,
I CAN CHANGE IT.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.643
NO, NO.
IT'S NOT THE NAME
THAT BOTHERS ME.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.770
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET TOO ATTACHED
TO HIM, THAT'S ALL.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.730
WHEN THAT SLEEPY EYE FAIR
ROLLS AROUND,

04:33.898 --> 04:35.565
HE'S GONNA BRING
A PRETTY GOOD PRICE
AT AUCTION.

WE'RE GONNA ENTER HIM
IN A FAIR?

04:37.527 --> 04:39.569
NOT WE. YOU.
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S RAISING HIM.

YOU JUST MIGHT WIN A PRIZE.

HE HAS ENOUGH GRAIN.

ALMOST READY!

IS THE LIST OF

IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER,

A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

NOT IN SUCH DETAIL.

COME ON, FAGIN.

WERE TOO DUMB FOR THAT.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.639
WELL, LOOK.
HE COMES WHEN
ALBERT CALLS HIM.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.226
WELL, I WOULD, TOO,
IF HE HAD MY SUPPER.

PROMISED HIM

LICORICE, HUH?

LOOKING GOOD!

13:48.202 --> 13:50.203
THANKS.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.336

FINISHED MY REPORT
ON THE REFORMATION.

OK.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.201
HI, DARLING.
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

14:30.369 --> 14:32.370

MY FAVORITE TIME OF YEAR.

IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE WE WENT FISHING
TOGETHER.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.344
I SUPPOSE IT HAS.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.805
WE OUGHT TO SET A TIME
AND JUST GO.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.348

DIG US SOME WORMS.

JUST YOU AND I COULD GO.

LIKE OLD TIMES.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.739
THAT SOUNDS
JUST PERFECT.

15:24.381 --> 15:26.549

HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICHES.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.885

A CARROT CAKE, TOO.

TO ALL THAT TROUBLE.

SOMETHING SPECIAL.

YOUR APPLE TURNOVERS.

15:36.393 --> 15:39.771
WELL, NOBODY TOLD ME
THAT RIPE APPLES HAD
TO BE RED AND NOT GREEN.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.856
YEAH. AND PEELED
AND SLICED.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.358

I USED TO PRETEND THAT
I WAS GONNA MARRY YOU?

WELL, WHO ELSE
WERE YOU GONNA MARRY?

THOSE APPLE TURNOVERS,

15:55.955 --> 15:57.372
NOBODY ELSE
WOULD HAVE YOU.

A LOT SINCE THEN.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.751
NOW I CAN DO ANYTHING
I WANT TO.

RAISED FAGIN ALL BY MYSELF.

I CAN'T PROMISE
ANY MIRACLES.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.629
THERE IS
ONE TREATMENT, BUT
IT'S QUITE DRASTIC.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.178
I DON'T KNOW.

25:56.346 --> 25:59.181
COME ON.
THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.
DID SHE SAY SOMETHING?

25:59.349 --> 26:03.394
DON'T YOU WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT?

26:05.355 --> 26:07.022
NO.

26:08.191 --> 26:10.025
YOU'LL HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE TO HER.

26:10.193 --> 26:11.986
YOU KNOW THAT,
DON'T YOU?

26:12.153 --> 26:15.281
APOLOGIZE?!
I DIDN'T HEAR ALBERT
APOLOGIZE TO DENZIL.

26:15.448 --> 26:16.448
NOW, YOU KNOW
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

26:16.616 --> 26:17.658
HE HAD A REASON
FOR FIGHTING DENZIL.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.243
YOU DON'T
SEEM TO HAVE ONE.

26:21.246 --> 26:25.124
YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT TO EXPLAIN?

26:25.292 --> 26:27.042
ALL RIGHT. AHEM.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.795
AS SOON
AS SCHOOL'S OUT,
WE'LL GO INTO TOWN.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.505
YOU MAY WAIT
IN YOUR ROOM.

26:58.658 --> 27:00.034

27:00.201 --> 27:02.995

NICE STEAK FOR YOU.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

27:04.205 --> 27:07.249
OH. I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK, DEAR.

27:11.421 --> 27:12.588
CAROLINE.

27:12.756 --> 27:14.089
MRS. OLESON.

27:14.257 --> 27:17.217
WELL, I'M SURPRISED
THAT YOUR DAUGHTER
HAS THE GALL

27:17.385 --> 27:19.678
TO SHOW HER FACE
AROUND HERE.

27:19.846 --> 27:23.265
LAURA WOULD LIKE
TO SPEAK TO NELLIE,
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.559
COME IN, PLEASE.

27:30.899 --> 27:36.028
NELLIE, DARLING...
MRS. INGALLS IS HERE
WITH LAURA.

27:37.697 --> 27:39.365
LAURA.

27:43.161 --> 27:45.496
KEEP HER
AWAY FROM ME!

27:45.664 --> 27:48.791
NOW, NOW, NOW, DARLING.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

27:48.958 --> 27:51.585
MOTHER'S HERE.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.842
LAURA.

28:09.145 --> 28:10.854
[VERY SOFTLY]
I'm sorry, Nellie.

28:11.022 --> 28:13.565
WELL, I SHOULD SAY SO!

28:13.733 --> 28:15.651
Mrs. Oleson:
RUINED HER DRESS.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.945
ALL THE WAY
FROM ST. LOUIS.

28:18.113 --> 28:21.156
Caroline: DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL PAY FOR IT.

28:21.324 --> 28:23.242
WHAT ABOUT ME?

28:23.410 --> 28:25.077
LOOK WHAT SHE DID TO ME.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.496
Mrs. Oleson: THE POINT IS,
OF COURSE,

28:27.664 --> 28:31.458
THAT WELL-BRED GIRLS
DO NOT GO AROUND
PUNCHING ONE ANOTHER

28:31.626 --> 28:33.794
LIKE COMMON BULLIES.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.546
LAURA KNOWS THAT,
MRS. OLESON.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.673
THAT'S WHY SHE
WANTED TO APOLOGIZE.

28:37.841 --> 28:42.136
OH. WELL, I HOPE
YOU DO KNOW THAT, YOUNG LADY.

28:42.303 --> 28:45.973
I SAID I WAS SORRY!

28:48.309 --> 28:51.186
LET US KNOW
WHAT WE OWE YOU
FOR THE DRESS.

28:51.354 --> 28:53.564
I'LL BRING IT IN
NEXT WEEK.

29:01.156 --> 29:04.867
LAURA, I WANT YOU TO
STOP THAT CRYING NOW!

29:05.034 --> 29:07.494
NOBODY CARES ABOUT ME!

29:07.662 --> 29:10.038
NELLIE GETS PUNCHED,
EVERYBODY CARES.

29:10.206 --> 29:12.249
FAGIN GETS SICK,
EVERYBODY CARES.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.168
LAURA, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

29:14.335 --> 29:15.377
YES, IT IS!

29:15.545 --> 29:19.715
I KNOW IT'S TRUE.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.884
AND ALBERT...

29:22.051 --> 29:24.303
I THOUGHT HE LIKED ME...

29:24.471 --> 29:27.055
BUT IT WASN'T ME
HE WANTED.

29:27.223 --> 29:29.391
IT WAS PA.

29:29.559 --> 29:31.685
MY PA.

29:33.396 --> 29:36.899
HE DOESN'T EVEN
SPEND ANY TIME
WITH ME ANYMORE.

29:37.066 --> 29:41.403
HE'S ALWAYS WITH ALBERT
AND THAT STUPID CALF.

29:41.571 --> 29:44.156
AND ALBERT...

29:44.324 --> 29:47.326
HE CALLS HIM "PA."

29:50.580 --> 29:53.040
BUT DON'T EXPECT ME
TO CALL HIM MY BROTHER,

29:53.208 --> 29:55.417
BECAUSE HE ISN'T!

29:55.585 --> 29:56.543
LAURA?

29:56.711 --> 29:58.253
WAIT!

30:09.641 --> 30:11.934
I WISH THE FAIR
WERE SOONER.

30:12.101 --> 30:13.435
CAN'T WAIT MUCH LONGER.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.103
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WAIT MUCH LONGER.

30:15.271 --> 30:16.772
IT'S ONLY TWO DAYS AWAY.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.148
SEEMS LIKE FOREVER.

30:18.316 --> 30:19.274
Caroline:
CHARLES.

30:19.442 --> 30:20.776
I PUT THE BABY DOWN
FOR A NAP.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.277
IS LAURA HERE?

30:22.445 --> 30:23.529
NO.

30:23.696 --> 30:25.155
I NEED TO
TALK TO YOU.

30:25.323 --> 30:26.615
CAN WE GO IN THE BARN?

30:26.783 --> 30:27.866
ALL RIGHT.

30:28.034 --> 30:29.284
SOON AS
YOU'RE FINISHED
BRUSHING HIM,

30:29.452 --> 30:30.786
YOU TAKE CARE
OF HIS HOOVES.

30:30.954 --> 30:32.496
REMEMBER,
THERE'S 4 OF THEM.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.623
I COUNTED. ONE
ON EACH CORNER.

30:34.791 --> 30:37.960
HA HA HA!

30:38.127 --> 30:39.753
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

30:39.921 --> 30:41.713
LAURA HAS A LOT
ON HER MIND,

30:41.881 --> 30:44.424
MOST OF WHICH
SHE PASSED ON TO ME.

30:44.592 --> 30:45.843
WHAT IS IT?

30:46.010 --> 30:50.055
SHE DOESN'T FEEL
NEEDED AROUND HERE...
OR LOVED.

30:50.223 --> 30:51.640
WHAT?

30:51.808 --> 30:54.810
COME ON, CAROLINE.
THAT'S JUST PLAIN SILLY.

30:54.978 --> 30:57.062
I DON'T THINK IT IS.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.940
I BRUSHED YOU
REAL GOOD.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.526
NOW I'M GONNA
DO YOUR HOOVES.

31:06.239 --> 31:08.156
Charles: I'M TRYING
TO GET THE FARM
BACK ON ITS FEET.

31:08.324 --> 31:09.741
IT TAKES UP
MOST OF MY DAY.

31:09.909 --> 31:11.743
Caroline: AND THE REST
IS FOR ALBERT.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.287
WHAT IS THIS THING
WITH ALBERT?

31:13.454 --> 31:15.163
HE'S GOT 600 POUNDS
OF BEEF OUT THERE.

31:15.331 --> 31:16.832
THAT'S MONEY
IN THE BANK.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.417
I KNOW THAT,

31:18.585 --> 31:22.671
BUT LAURA ONLY REMEMBERS
WHAT IT WAS LIKE
BEFORE HE CAME.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.757
IN A LOT OF WAYS,
SHE'S STILL
YOUR LITTLE GIRL.

31:25.925 --> 31:27.509
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"IN A LOT OF WAYS"?

31:27.677 --> 31:29.761
SHE IS
MY LITTLE GIRL.
YOU KNOW THAT.

31:29.929 --> 31:32.347
CHARLES, WHY ARE YOU
ARGUING WITH ME?

31:32.515 --> 31:36.560
COULD IT BE BECAUSE
THERE'S A GRAIN OF TRUTH
IN WHAT SHE'S THINKING?

31:36.728 --> 31:38.937
WHAT, THAT
I DON'T LOVE HER?

31:39.105 --> 31:43.150
NO. THAT YOU'VE BEEN
NEGLECTING HER.

32:01.753 --> 32:05.172
I JUST HAD A TALK
WITH YOUR MA.

32:06.549 --> 32:10.177
SHE SET ME STRAIGHT
ON A FEW THINGS.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.765
I KNOW I HAVEN'T...

32:16.935 --> 32:19.186
I HAVEN'T BEEN
TREATING YOU RIGHT,

32:19.354 --> 32:21.188
BUT I HADN'T REALIZED
THAT, YOU KNOW?

32:21.356 --> 32:24.399
AND I JUST WANTED YOU
TO HEAR MY SIDE OF IT.

32:26.986 --> 32:28.487
YOU SEE,
WHEN ALBERT COME TO US,

32:28.655 --> 32:33.408
I WANTED HIM TO FEEL LIKE
HE WAS PART OF THE FAMILY,
YOU KNOW?

32:36.412 --> 32:40.791
SO I SPENT
A LOT MORE TIME WITH HIM
THAN I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE.

32:42.669 --> 32:44.795
AND IT WAS...

32:46.464 --> 32:48.340
IT WAS ONLY 'CAUSE
I LOVE YOU MORE
THAN ANYTHING,

32:48.508 --> 32:52.344
AND I JUST
TOOK IT FOR GRANTED
THAT YOU KNEW THAT.

32:52.512 --> 32:55.639
IT WAS DUMB OF ME.

32:57.684 --> 33:02.020
AND IT WAS DUMB OF ME
FOR NOT TELLING YOU
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU.

33:03.439 --> 33:05.983
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.151
