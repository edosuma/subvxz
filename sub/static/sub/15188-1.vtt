00:31.751 --> 00:36.876
KIKI, LOVE TO LOVE

02:02.542 --> 02:03.667
That was good.

02:04.709 --> 02:05.792
Good, good.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.126
Good or what?

02:07.751 --> 02:09.667
Like a bull?
- A fighting bull.

02:09.751 --> 02:10.834
Really good.

02:12.459 --> 02:14.126
Or more of a lion, or what?

02:14.209 --> 02:16.501
Do you want me to give you a score?

02:17.209 --> 02:18.792
Really good.
End of story.

02:19.292 --> 02:22.126
- What's wrong, Natalia?
- Nothing.

02:22.959 --> 02:24.959
I was just saying...

02:25.626 --> 02:26.792
Well, just...

02:29.209 --> 02:30.042
What's up?

02:31.376 --> 02:34.167
I can't stop thinking
about the petrol station.

02:34.251 --> 02:37.334
Seriously, are you thinking
about that now, Natalia?

02:37.959 --> 02:39.501
It's over now.

02:44.084 --> 02:45.751
I didn't tell you everything.

02:51.251 --> 02:53.917
<i>I went to the petrol station
with a 200? note</i>

02:54.001 --> 02:55.542
<i>to get change.</i>

02:55.626 --> 02:57.917
<i>I'd had it ages
and I wanted it changed.</i>

02:58.001 --> 03:00.459
<i>I bought an ice cream
but the girl wouldn't change it.</i>

03:00.542 --> 03:02.126
- You've nothing smaller?
- No.

03:02.334 --> 03:04.417
- We don't take 200? notes.
- I've no change.

03:04.501 --> 03:05.501
I'll take a card but...

03:05.584 --> 03:09.126
<i>A man came up from behind
and grabbed me</i>

03:09.209 --> 03:11.459
<i>and asked the cashier for the money.</i>

03:11.584 --> 03:14.251
- Open the till or I'll stab her!
- I can't open it.

03:14.334 --> 03:17.251
<i>They started arguing
and he put a knife to my throat.</i>

03:17.542 --> 03:20.584
<i>At first I was really scared.</i>

03:21.584 --> 03:22.792
But then...

03:23.542 --> 03:27.376
I started feeling something down below.

03:27.459 --> 03:32.126
<i>Like heat rising and rising
and I didn't know why,</i>

03:32.209 --> 03:33.959
<i>and I was getting aroused.</i>

03:34.792 --> 03:35.792
I was aroused.

03:36.501 --> 03:38.959
<i>And I was coming and coming and...</i>

03:39.834 --> 03:40.792
<i>I came.</i>

03:40.876 --> 03:43.042
HARPAXOPHILIA

03:43.126 --> 03:45.876
ATTRACTION PRODUCED ON BEING MUGGED
OR ROBBED WITH VIOLENCE

03:48.584 --> 03:49.667
You came?

03:50.292 --> 03:52.209
I came right there, Alex.

03:53.042 --> 03:55.126
You came, but how?

03:56.167 --> 03:57.209
Like with me now?

03:57.584 --> 03:58.834
No. More!

03:59.501 --> 04:00.334
More!

04:00.542 --> 04:02.626
I didn't know what was happening.

04:02.709 --> 04:04.376
I couldn't control it,

04:04.459 --> 04:07.251
it came up from below
and then went downwards,

04:07.334 --> 04:10.667
it was the situation,
not knowing what was going on.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.959
- You came a lot?
- Loads.

04:13.709 --> 04:16.500
I don't know, Natalia...
I don't...

04:17.834 --> 04:19.666
I don't know what to say...

04:19.834 --> 04:20.875
Nothing.

04:21.041 --> 04:22.376
You don't have to say anything.

04:22.459 --> 04:24.001
You just said that last week

04:24.084 --> 04:27.709
you had the biggest shag of your life
with another guy.

04:28.876 --> 04:30.417
What can I say?
Nothing.

04:30.501 --> 04:32.126
I didn't see his face, Alex.

04:32.292 --> 04:35.417
You get off sucking a foot,
and I get off with that.

04:35.501 --> 04:37.751
Sure, it's the same.
Exactly the same.

04:38.376 --> 04:40.209
I can't tell you anything!

04:40.292 --> 04:41.542
Honestly...

04:45.292 --> 04:48.292
My name is Paco.
She's Ana.

04:48.542 --> 04:51.292
We have a five-year-old daughter,

04:51.834 --> 04:52.792
Luna.

04:53.209 --> 04:57.667
- We've been together...
- For eight years now.

04:58.042 --> 05:02.084
We aren't here because we have doubts
whether we want to stay together or not.

05:02.167 --> 05:04.292
We don't doubt our love.
- Good.

05:04.376 --> 05:05.542
I want you to think

05:05.626 --> 05:09.209
about what could be improved
in sexual terms.

05:12.542 --> 05:15.417
He's a bit reserved,
perhaps because he's Andalusian.

05:15.501 --> 05:18.751
He's never been to therapy,
he's got them all.

05:19.167 --> 05:21.792
And in my case, I have,
I've done a bit.

05:21.876 --> 05:22.792
Good.

05:23.167 --> 05:25.334
Things to improve?
Well...

05:27.167 --> 05:29.584
- Speak up.
- Yes, we can talk about it.

05:29.667 --> 05:30.667
Yes.

05:32.834 --> 05:34.167
Her blow jobs...

05:35.042 --> 05:36.042
aren't good.

05:38.876 --> 05:39.792
I think.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.001
I mean...

05:45.084 --> 05:47.209
They could be better, you know?

05:51.584 --> 05:52.459
I don't know.

05:54.626 --> 05:56.417
Anything to say to him, Ana?

05:57.667 --> 05:59.501
No, it comes as a surprise.

05:59.584 --> 06:03.084
It's odd that he tells you,
a complete stranger,

06:03.167 --> 06:06.667
and he hasn't told me in all this time.

06:06.751 --> 06:09.209
It seems a bit like wasted time.

06:09.959 --> 06:13.292
He tells me how
and I do it as he says.

06:13.376 --> 06:15.459
It didn't come up in conversation.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.667
She doesn't do it badly,
I like it.

06:19.001 --> 06:20.167
But...

06:22.709 --> 06:24.292
She sucks the bell end.

06:25.542 --> 06:27.834
The... the glans.

06:29.042 --> 06:31.167
The... She licks it.

06:31.542 --> 06:35.376
But I've seen on films
it's more deep throat, not so...

06:35.459 --> 06:36.251
You know?

06:36.542 --> 06:39.042
The shaft is sensitive too,
I don't know.

06:39.959 --> 06:42.126
Can you remember any other fellatio

06:42.209 --> 06:45.584
which is more satisfactory
than what Ana does?

06:46.584 --> 06:47.626
Well...

06:48.334 --> 06:52.126
Excuse me, isn't this more like
individual therapy keep asking him?

06:52.209 --> 06:53.334
- No.
- I'm asking

06:53.417 --> 06:57.584
because I'm not sure
I want to hear all this.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.251
- I shouldn't have said anything.
- Yes, carry on.

07:00.334 --> 07:03.709
Say it and I'll change it, fine.
Because...

07:06.417 --> 07:09.667
It comes to mind,
thinking out loud, perhaps...

07:09.751 --> 07:13.001
My grandmother used to get jaw lock.

07:13.084 --> 07:16.751
So perhaps,
when it comes to doing, let's say,

07:16.834 --> 07:21.417
doing it deep throat,
I hold back through fear

07:21.501 --> 07:23.334
of getting jaw lock.

07:23.417 --> 07:26.167
That's what first comes to mind.

07:26.292 --> 07:27.459
It could be that.
- Maybe.

07:27.542 --> 07:30.751
- He's got things too.
- Come on, then.

07:30.834 --> 07:34.584
- He doesn't take time, you know?
- Yes.

07:34.667 --> 07:38.167
He gets straight in there,
as if I were a walking genital organ.

07:38.251 --> 07:39.209
- You know?
- Yes.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.126
It's odd.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.751
Please, stay calm.
Take it easy.

07:43.209 --> 07:46.292
It is absolutely normal

07:46.376 --> 07:48.917
in a couple that has been together
for such time.

07:49.001 --> 07:50.792
Of course, the flame dies.

07:50.876 --> 07:51.584
But,

07:51.792 --> 07:54.459
<i>if there is wood,
if there is a spark and a will,</i>

07:54.542 --> 07:57.126
<i>everything can start burning again.</i>

07:57.292 --> 08:01.126
<i>There are hidden philias,
desires which we ignore.</i>

08:01.751 --> 08:06.084
<i>I would suggest
you investigate your own sexuality.</i>

08:06.542 --> 08:07.334
<i>Trust me.</i>

08:07.709 --> 08:09.209
<i>There's so much to do.</i>

08:10.126 --> 08:12.084
You carry on.
I'll start now.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.876
- Are you starting?
- Yes, but...

08:13.959 --> 08:16.667
- Go on.
- No, no. You carry on, I'll...

08:17.001 --> 08:17.876
Slut.

08:19.584 --> 08:21.542
Slut.
Little whore.

08:22.251 --> 08:25.126
No, wait.
Better in... Better in...

08:25.417 --> 08:28.001
Little whore.
You're a little slut.

08:30.501 --> 08:32.292
I want you to fill me.

08:32.417 --> 08:33.876
- To fill you?
- Completely.

08:33.958 --> 08:36.542
- You're turning me on, you know?
- Me too.

08:36.626 --> 08:38.417
You want meat and tomatoes, right?

08:38.501 --> 08:40.458
- Do you like...?
- I want some rod.

08:40.542 --> 08:43.208
You want my rod, right?
There...

08:49.834 --> 08:52.209
- Say things to me as well.
- Pig.

08:53.876 --> 08:56.126
- I'm a pig?
- A stinking pig.

08:56.751 --> 08:57.959
Stinking?

09:00.167 --> 09:03.626
- Sorry.
- What do you mean, stinking?

09:04.042 --> 09:06.917
Is stinking nice?
It that sexy, woman?

09:07.001 --> 09:08.126
Stinking?

09:09.209 --> 09:11.209
I don't know,
it just came out.

09:11.584 --> 09:13.417
Why?
Do I smell or something?

09:13.626 --> 09:14.667
Come here.

09:16.001 --> 09:18.667
- But, stinking...
- Paco.

09:19.834 --> 09:22.834
I can't believe it.
Stop it, you're killing the moment.

09:23.292 --> 09:26.417
- Take it seriously.
- I was taking it seriously.

09:29.959 --> 09:31.626
Well, you weren't exactly...

09:31.709 --> 09:34.459
I mean... No?
- I'm taking it seriously.

09:34.542 --> 09:37.376
Yes, but you say things too, don't you?

09:37.459 --> 09:39.792
You said things too.
- But what I said...

09:39.876 --> 09:42.251
If we're all so, so...

09:42.667 --> 09:43.876
So playboy, right?

09:44.667 --> 09:45.376
Fine.

09:46.959 --> 09:48.751
- The doorbell.
- Well, that's it.

09:49.542 --> 09:51.417
- Are you going to answer?
- Yes.

09:54.501 --> 09:55.584
Hi, is Paco in?

09:56.542 --> 09:59.126
Forgive me, really.
- No.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.459
What a scene.

10:05.126 --> 10:08.292
I've barged in, Paco,
and I'm not like that, you know that.

10:08.376 --> 10:09.959
I really do apologise.

10:10.042 --> 10:12.417
- What has happened?
- Nothing has happened.

10:14.126 --> 10:18.459
They are going to operate
Weirdo's leg, Paco.

10:18.542 --> 10:21.584
And the poor thing is having
a really bad, bad, bad, bad time.

10:21.667 --> 10:24.334
She fell to pieces
and started to cry on me,

10:24.417 --> 10:28.167
and I gave her a kiss.
Paco, a little kiss.

10:28.251 --> 10:31.709
Well, Rebe went mad.
Mad.

10:32.626 --> 10:35.834
She started calling me
"whore" and "slut"...

10:36.209 --> 10:37.667
She's thrown me out.

10:39.459 --> 10:40.376
Over a kiss.

10:40.792 --> 10:42.334
A little kiss, Paco.

10:42.917 --> 10:44.459
After all I've done for her.

10:44.542 --> 10:48.084
You can't imagine
all that I've done for her.

10:49.126 --> 10:51.834
When she asked me to piss on her,
I pissed on her.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.709
And I don't like all that, Paco.

10:53.792 --> 10:56.167
God knows, Paco,
I'm not like that.

10:56.292 --> 10:59.167
When she took to bondage,
and she had me tied up,

10:59.251 --> 11:02.042
I was tied up like a pig,
I did it.

11:02.751 --> 11:04.709
I... I did it...

11:05.417 --> 11:08.667
because I wanted to as well.
I must confess that I did too.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.959
I did whatever she asked me, but...

11:11.042 --> 11:13.292
Modern for some things,
old-fashioned for others.

11:13.376 --> 11:14.251
That's it.

11:14.334 --> 11:16.001
Did she ask you to piss on her?

11:16.084 --> 11:17.542
To piss on her.

11:18.959 --> 11:20.709
And she pissed on me too.

11:21.917 --> 11:25.292
I hate to remember, Paco,
the day we ate asparagus.

11:25.584 --> 11:27.376
Asparagus makes it stink.

11:27.917 --> 11:30.376
- It makes urine smell...
- Yes.

11:30.501 --> 11:33.334
- It does.
- And it's immediate.

11:33.876 --> 11:35.751
Odd, isn't it?
- Yes, it stinks...

11:35.834 --> 11:37.292
It really stinks.

11:37.376 --> 11:40.167
Asparagus doesn't smell,
not even grilled,

11:40.251 --> 11:42.084
but it doesn't half cause a smell.
- Direct.

11:42.167 --> 11:44.417
Direct.
Direct onto my face.

11:44.917 --> 11:45.834
Right?

11:47.459 --> 11:49.167
My problem is, Ana,

11:49.417 --> 11:51.792
I'm a very affectionate person.

11:51.959 --> 11:54.334
I get affectionate quickly, Ana.
- Always.

11:54.417 --> 11:55.209
Always.

11:55.292 --> 11:58.209
After two beers I could snog my mother.

11:58.542 --> 12:02.459
But people don't understand that.
- No.

12:04.126 --> 12:06.042
Madrid seems very modern.

12:07.501 --> 12:09.167
But Madrid isn't modern.

12:09.751 --> 12:10.501
No.

12:11.501 --> 12:13.792
Remember
when I came up from Seville, Paco?

12:14.292 --> 12:18.042
I came empty handed.

12:18.959 --> 12:20.042
My poor thing...

12:21.792 --> 12:23.834
I didn't know how to eat pussy.

12:24.292 --> 12:26.001
And look at me now.

12:26.084 --> 12:28.459
I've tasted all kinds, right?

12:28.542 --> 12:30.584
- That's true.
-It's true.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.667
Do you remember
when we hooked up at the Seville Fair?

12:35.042 --> 12:36.334
Remember?
- Yes.

12:36.417 --> 12:37.959
Have you told Ana?

12:38.042 --> 12:39.417
- No.
- No?

12:39.501 --> 12:42.126
Hasn't he told you?
- No, never.

12:42.542 --> 12:44.001
We were kids...

12:44.084 --> 12:46.584
We were kids,
real hippies, real hippies.

12:46.667 --> 12:47.876
Do you remember?

12:47.959 --> 12:51.042
In the communist tent.
- In the cubicle.

12:51.292 --> 12:53.834
In the cubicle, round the back.

12:55.959 --> 12:58.001
Hey, I haven't told you...

12:58.459 --> 13:00.167
I've got a job.

13:00.542 --> 13:03.751
I've been working
in a sex club for a month.

13:04.667 --> 13:07.084
- As a whore?
- A whore? Hell, Paco...

13:07.167 --> 13:08.626
You tell me.

13:09.042 --> 13:10.501
As a waitress, dammit.

13:11.626 --> 13:14.584
As a waitress in a sex club,
it's great.

13:14.667 --> 13:16.917
- What's it like?
- Have you never been?

13:17.001 --> 13:17.667
No.

13:17.751 --> 13:20.459
Well, it's a kind of pub,
a nightclub.

13:20.584 --> 13:22.334
But there are theme parties.

13:22.876 --> 13:25.751
They might do swinging couples,

13:25.834 --> 13:29.709
gays, lesbians, latex,
fetish competitions...

13:30.001 --> 13:32.834
There are sometimes
strange things as well.

13:32.917 --> 13:36.709
But generally,
there's a great atmosphere.

13:37.084 --> 13:39.709
I'm getting to know interesting people.

13:40.292 --> 13:43.001
The other day, Sánchez Dragó came.

13:45.084 --> 13:46.042
Your phone.

13:47.751 --> 13:48.959
Where the fuck...?

13:49.042 --> 13:50.584
It's Rebe.
Excuse me.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.126
What?
Wait a minute.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.292
We don't make the most of Madrid.

14:31.959 --> 14:33.084
Antonio?

14:35.584 --> 14:38.292
Come here, come here.
Come here, quick.

14:42.042 --> 14:43.459
- Wait.
- Yes.

14:44.292 --> 14:45.167
There.

15:00.584 --> 15:02.459
Antonio, you know I'm not ovulating.

15:02.542 --> 15:05.751
Yes, but it seemed a shame to waste it,
you never know.

15:09.084 --> 15:10.501
How was your day?

15:12.126 --> 15:13.126
Fine.

15:28.501 --> 15:30.084
<i>It's always the same.</i>

15:30.376 --> 15:31.959
<i>Two days before ovulating,</i>

15:32.042 --> 15:34.709
<i>we do it in the morning,
we do it at night...</i>

15:34.792 --> 15:37.459
<i>In the position that you recommended.</i>

15:38.417 --> 15:40.292
<i>It's been...
I don't know, two years.</i>

15:40.376 --> 15:42.709
<i>Almost two years,
and it's tiring.</i>

15:43.876 --> 15:45.417
Yet I do everything.

15:45.501 --> 15:48.334
I eat everything,
I hadn't eaten vegetables in my life.

15:48.417 --> 15:49.459
Or fruit.

15:50.126 --> 15:54.167
I'm stuffing myself
with folic acid and proteins.

15:54.626 --> 15:56.459
I haven't been like this ever.

15:57.501 --> 16:00.334
Everything is fine, María Candelaria.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.251
There is no physiological problem.

16:04.001 --> 16:07.334
Look,
what I want you to understand is that...

16:07.709 --> 16:09.292
the body isn't a perfect machine.

16:09.376 --> 16:11.959
Sometimes, things simply don't turn out.

16:12.042 --> 16:13.292
I can't understand.

16:13.376 --> 16:16.542
It's been two years,
and for my head...

16:16.626 --> 16:19.167
I'm in a state, a real state...

16:21.667 --> 16:23.209
Do you reach orgasm during coitus?

16:24.709 --> 16:25.667
Orgasm?

16:25.751 --> 16:28.709
Do you usually have an orgasm
when you have intercourse?

16:30.251 --> 16:32.792
Orgasm?
I think I've had one.

16:33.542 --> 16:36.667
When I have intercourse?
Yes, I think so.

16:36.959 --> 16:38.751
I mean recently,

16:38.834 --> 16:41.709
since you've been trying
to get pregnant.

16:45.709 --> 16:48.792
I won't mislead you, doctor.
Not since I got married.

16:48.917 --> 16:49.834
No.

16:51.709 --> 16:53.084
Is it bad?

16:56.167 --> 16:58.667
Perhaps we ought to look into that.

16:59.042 --> 17:03.001
It's clear that the orgasm helps
in becoming pregnant.

17:04.376 --> 17:08.834
The vaginal spasms
help the sperm to reach the egg.

17:08.916 --> 17:09.916
Of course.

17:12.584 --> 17:14.126
I'll bear it in mind.

17:18.041 --> 17:19.626
Here, kid.
Take this.

17:19.834 --> 17:21.626
Go and get another one, it's broken.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.291
How did it go?
- I don't know. Fine.

17:26.959 --> 17:29.542
The endometrium is okay.
Everything is fine.

17:29.626 --> 17:30.834
The cervical mucus?

17:30.917 --> 17:33.084
That's just it,
everything is fine.

17:33.459 --> 17:35.459
Everything looks to be fine.

17:35.542 --> 17:36.876
Well, that's good.

17:39.542 --> 17:42.417
The only thing she said is that...

17:43.501 --> 17:47.459
it's easier to get pregnant
if you have an orgasm.

17:48.417 --> 17:50.126
You always have one, don't you?

17:51.251 --> 17:52.376
That's it then.

17:54.417 --> 17:55.501
That's it.

17:58.626 --> 17:59.417
Hi, kid.

17:59.501 --> 18:02.042
Carlota, how are you?

18:02.626 --> 18:04.167
Who's going to kiss that face?

18:05.209 --> 18:06.167
What?

18:06.876 --> 18:09.042
How did it happen?
- She's done a poo.

18:09.126 --> 18:10.959
- I'll change her nappy.
- Yes.

18:14.417 --> 18:15.292
Okay.

18:22.334 --> 18:23.876
What's wrong, Antonio?

18:24.542 --> 18:26.167
César has just phoned.

18:26.251 --> 18:27.917
Paquito has been killed
on his motorbike.

18:32.167 --> 18:33.709
Antonio...

18:34.376 --> 18:35.751
DACRYPHILIA

18:35.834 --> 18:38.667
SEXUAL PLEASURE
CAUSED BY SEEING SOMEONE CRY

18:38.792 --> 18:40.667
I've never seen you cry.

18:41.001 --> 18:42.917
Calm down, love.

18:43.792 --> 18:45.501
It's okay, my love.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.084
Okay.

18:48.834 --> 18:49.751
Okay.

18:50.626 --> 18:51.459
Okay.

18:53.292 --> 18:54.042
Okay.

19:56.792 --> 19:58.167
What are you doing?

20:02.084 --> 20:03.001
Again?

20:04.584 --> 20:06.209
Don't even think of it.

20:06.542 --> 20:07.917
Don't dream of it.

20:14.501 --> 20:15.834
SOMNOPHILIA

20:15.917 --> 20:19.042
SEXUAL AROUSAL CAUSED
WHILST WATCHING A PERSON SLEEP

20:22.001 --> 20:24.501
Right, we're done.

20:25.501 --> 20:28.584
Sew her up, bandage her up
and take her to the ward.

20:28.667 --> 20:30.584
- Okay, Tramadol or Nolotil?
- Tramadol.

20:30.667 --> 20:33.626
Quite a lot has come out in the end.

20:34.959 --> 20:37.417
The operation seemed to last for ages...

20:37.501 --> 20:39.084
I don't know if you were slow

20:39.167 --> 20:43.001
or I have to stop
operating in high heels.

20:45.126 --> 20:46.709
What have we got tomorrow?

20:46.834 --> 20:49.042
Two lipos
and a vaginoplasty first thing.

20:49.126 --> 20:50.459
First thing.

20:50.542 --> 20:54.917
I don't know how you can operate a pussy
without having a coffee first.

20:56.042 --> 20:58.626
I haven't told you about Diana,
my daughter.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.584
She's selling.
- Really?

21:01.667 --> 21:04.584
Yes, I'm really happy.
I'm so proud.

21:05.042 --> 21:07.167
She has her own business online.

21:08.459 --> 21:11.876
She's selling
used knickers on the Internet.

21:12.042 --> 21:12.626
Knickers?

21:12.709 --> 21:16.084
Knickers, knickers.
Her used knickers.

21:16.209 --> 21:17.459
She is.

21:17.667 --> 21:21.667
She has her own website:
Diana'sKnickers.com.

21:22.751 --> 21:26.209
Men contact her
and she meets up with them.

21:26.292 --> 21:29.584
She takes them off right there
and hands them over.

21:30.251 --> 21:32.876
And I say to her,
"Well, Diana, let's see...

21:33.042 --> 21:35.042
How much do you sell them for?"

21:35.126 --> 21:36.917
She says,
"They've paid

21:37.251 --> 21:40.626
up to 150?
for ones with a bit of shit on."

21:42.209 --> 21:44.001
I say,
"With shit on, Diana?"

21:44.084 --> 21:46.876
She says,
"Yes, they ask for all sorts.

21:46.959 --> 21:49.334
Requests vary from person to person."

21:49.417 --> 21:53.251
She talks in such a professional manner
you're dumbstruck.

21:53.876 --> 21:56.251
"You're getting
all wound up over nothing.

21:56.334 --> 21:58.501
It's a really common fetish.

21:58.584 --> 22:02.334
Sniffing the female
is an ancient custom."

22:03.542 --> 22:06.292
That fuckwit
gets anthropological on me.

22:06.376 --> 22:10.626
I felt like giving her
a good open-handed smack.

22:10.709 --> 22:11.959
Sodding hell.

22:12.626 --> 22:15.167
Wait a minute, let me see this...

22:15.292 --> 22:17.501
Now Gonzalo, he wants...

22:18.501 --> 22:19.792
an opportunity.

22:21.042 --> 22:23.292
You'll drive your bloody mother mad.

22:23.376 --> 22:25.042
You'll drive me bloody mad...

22:32.459 --> 22:35.834
Sorry, José Luis.
I'm not well.

22:36.417 --> 22:38.251
No, I'm not well.

22:38.542 --> 22:42.084
Neither Fentanyl,

22:42.167 --> 22:45.084
nor Propofol, nor anything.
Right now,

22:45.251 --> 22:47.084
I've got to a point...

22:48.709 --> 22:51.709
that I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

22:52.334 --> 22:54.626
I don't know what I'm doing wrong,
because...

22:57.084 --> 22:58.501
I don't know.

22:59.584 --> 23:01.417
Well, what about you?

23:01.792 --> 23:03.709
You look very tired, José Luis.

23:03.792 --> 23:06.334
Are you sleeping well?
- No.

23:07.584 --> 23:08.334
No.

23:08.501 --> 23:10.292
You almost fell asleep
in the operating theatre.

23:10.376 --> 23:13.542
- I slept two hours.
- What's going on?

23:14.334 --> 23:15.667
Well...

23:16.251 --> 23:20.042
I'll give you some drops
which are stronger than Flunitrazepam.

23:21.292 --> 23:24.334
Apparently it caused
malformations in foetus.

23:24.542 --> 23:27.084
A few claims from patients
and they shit themselves.

23:27.167 --> 23:29.792
But you aren't going to be a mother
so take six drops.

23:29.876 --> 23:31.751
Don't take more, because...

23:31.834 --> 23:34.917
You might kick the bucket,
like Michael.

23:35.042 --> 23:38.376
This is marvellous, you rest...
- Maite, I'm not taking anything.

23:40.292 --> 23:42.084
Do you want it to happen again?

23:45.001 --> 23:46.876
By the way,
how's your wife?

23:50.209 --> 23:50.917
Yes...

23:51.001 --> 23:52.792
Oh, yes, yes, look...

23:53.084 --> 23:55.251
In Chusmari's manor, with the master.

23:56.417 --> 23:59.876
The year we met.
We used to dance so many Pasodobles.

24:00.042 --> 24:02.251
Do you like the Pasodoble?
- No.

24:03.126 --> 24:06.542
- I don't know.
- Of course, naturally.

24:06.626 --> 24:10.251
The Pasodoble is from one's roots,
from the blood.

24:10.334 --> 24:13.501
You have to feel it.
You can't get it with a passport.

24:13.584 --> 24:14.334
Yes.

24:14.959 --> 24:16.292
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

24:16.417 --> 24:19.084
<i>With the master here,
the year we met.</i>

24:19.292 --> 24:20.501
<i>Dancing Pasodobles.</i>

24:20.792 --> 24:22.084
I have another...

24:22.667 --> 24:25.751
Yes, at Pipo's wedding,

24:26.084 --> 24:27.459
the two of us...

24:27.542 --> 24:29.584
<i>- No, no, madam.
- I'm okay, I'm okay.</i>

24:29.667 --> 24:31.376
<i>- No, no.
- I've made progress.</i>

24:32.959 --> 24:33.626
Madam!

24:33.709 --> 24:34.626
<i>Madam!</i>

24:36.626 --> 24:39.584
What's happened? Let me see.
Paloma, are you all right?

24:40.376 --> 24:41.334
Up you get.

24:41.792 --> 24:44.209
Up you get, Paloma.
Are you all right?

24:45.167 --> 24:46.042
Paloma?

24:48.001 --> 24:48.959
Paloma.

24:51.126 --> 24:52.209
Can't you see?

24:57.542 --> 24:59.667
Sir, I'm so sorry.

24:59.751 --> 25:02.126
Don't worry,
you know what she's like.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.001
Okay.

25:03.334 --> 25:05.584
Sir, one question.

25:05.667 --> 25:09.001
How much does a boob operation cost?

25:10.251 --> 25:12.751
- Do you want a bust implant?
- Yes, sir.

25:12.834 --> 25:15.542
Between six and eight thousand euros.

25:15.626 --> 25:16.876
Okay.

25:17.417 --> 25:20.917
But for you,
we can do it for four thousand.

25:22.042 --> 25:23.876
Right, sir.
I'll save up.

25:24.542 --> 25:26.542
- Very well.
- Thank you, sir.

25:26.626 --> 25:27.792
You're welcome.

26:56.542 --> 26:57.876
Everything is okay.

26:59.751 --> 27:01.501
I'll do it, I'll do it.

27:12.626 --> 27:13.834
Catalonia...

27:19.292 --> 27:22.584
Lore, what do you think of Catalonia?
- Catalonia, madam?

27:23.667 --> 27:26.126
Nothing, madam.
Fine.

27:28.209 --> 27:30.001
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

27:39.042 --> 27:40.376
How did you sleep?

27:41.834 --> 27:42.667
Fine.

27:42.959 --> 27:45.001
Yes, I slept well.

27:45.667 --> 27:46.876
Especially well.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.626
Although it hurts a bit here.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.334
As if I've bumped my head.

27:56.751 --> 27:59.751
- Sir, here's your coffee.
- Thank you.

28:05.376 --> 28:06.959
I'm going,
I'll see you later.

28:08.334 --> 28:09.251
Don't be late.

28:16.167 --> 28:17.917
- Why not?
- Nothing.

28:19.917 --> 28:22.376
- You must have said it for some reason.
- No.

28:24.876 --> 28:26.751
- Are you sure it's nothing?
- I said "nothing".

28:26.834 --> 28:28.251
Don't,
you'll rub my cream off.

28:32.709 --> 28:35.584
- Goodbye, Lore.
- Goodbye, sir. Have a nice day.

28:41.292 --> 28:43.459
One thing.
I've been thinking and...

28:44.251 --> 28:47.084
I think we can do the implants
for two thousand euros.

28:48.751 --> 28:51.417
What do you think? Good?
- Good, sir. Thank you.

28:51.501 --> 28:52.459
No.

28:53.334 --> 28:54.084
Thanks to you.

29:51.584 --> 29:54.709
Right, you stay here,
you've messed me up more than once.

29:55.334 --> 29:56.626
I'll be right back.

29:59.126 --> 30:00.334
<i>What do you do?</i>

30:00.417 --> 30:03.042
I run my own business,
with an associate.

30:03.126 --> 30:04.167
Events.

30:04.251 --> 30:06.334
I thought I'd told you when we chatted.

30:06.417 --> 30:09.292
And business parties...
- Yes, party tricks.

30:09.542 --> 30:13.292
I'm not into parties
and alcohol or drugs.

30:13.376 --> 30:16.417
No, I mean...
There are no drugs, as far as I know.

30:16.501 --> 30:18.126
Yes, and any hang-ups?

30:20.376 --> 30:22.042
- I don't know.
- You must have one.

30:22.126 --> 30:25.459
Off the top of my head,
I don't know, the usual stuff.

30:25.542 --> 30:27.667
Usual... like everyone.

30:27.751 --> 30:30.292
Like everyone, nothing shameful.

30:30.376 --> 30:31.042
Sure.

30:31.126 --> 30:32.376
- Do you?
- Yes.

30:32.917 --> 30:35.001
You see, since I was a child,

30:36.001 --> 30:38.834
I've had a cloth that I call Wee-wee.

30:38.917 --> 30:39.959
Wee-wee?

30:40.501 --> 30:43.917
Without it,
I can't sleep or calm myself down.

30:44.417 --> 30:47.417
I take it with me everywhere
because it has become

30:47.876 --> 30:50.251
one of my greatest pleasures.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.042
For everything.

30:52.792 --> 30:54.167
- Yes, sure.
- Yes.

30:54.501 --> 30:55.459
Of course.

30:55.792 --> 30:58.042
I'm very fussy about fabric.

30:58.126 --> 30:59.876
- I can see that.
- Very particular.

31:00.084 --> 31:01.251
Polyester?

31:02.376 --> 31:03.042
I don't know.

31:03.126 --> 31:04.167
- You don't know?
- No.

31:04.251 --> 31:08.126
- You bought it... any old how.
- I don't know, I liked it.

31:08.209 --> 31:11.292
Wee-wee is silk.
But a bit of a silk mix.

31:11.459 --> 31:13.292
- Right.
-It's perfect.

31:15.334 --> 31:16.917
Shall I show it to you?

31:17.626 --> 31:18.501
What?

31:18.584 --> 31:19.709
The cloth.

31:44.376 --> 31:45.417
Here it is.

31:50.084 --> 31:51.001
Look.

31:51.501 --> 31:52.459
Close your eyes.

32:00.792 --> 32:02.459
- What?
- Wow!

32:03.751 --> 32:04.917
Soft.

32:05.001 --> 32:07.334
I hold it like this,
on this side.

32:08.126 --> 32:09.542
Suddenly...

32:11.376 --> 32:12.501
TEXTOPHILIA

32:12.584 --> 32:15.334
SEXUAL ATTRACTION
TOWARDS CERTAIN FABRICS

32:36.001 --> 32:36.959
What's funny?

32:39.834 --> 32:40.751
Nothing.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.792
- You're laughing at me.
- I'm not laughing.

32:42.876 --> 32:44.751
It's something...

32:45.542 --> 32:49.167
intimate that I'm showing you
and you shouldn't laugh.

32:49.251 --> 32:50.959
- I'm not.
- I didn't laugh at you.

32:51.042 --> 32:52.542
I'm not laughing, honestly.

32:52.709 --> 32:53.584
- Am I odd?
- No...

32:53.667 --> 32:54.501
I'm not odd.

32:54.584 --> 32:57.251
I've got my hang-ups and I'm different,
but I'm not odd.

32:57.334 --> 33:00.667
Perhaps you're the one
who isn't very different.

33:00.751 --> 33:04.834
I've seen lots of people like you,
with your fringe and your moustache.

33:04.917 --> 33:06.001
It's fine, really.

33:06.084 --> 33:07.501
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, believe me.

33:07.584 --> 33:10.376
I'm comfortable.
Very comfortable right now.

33:10.917 --> 33:12.376
Really, don't worry.

33:12.917 --> 33:14.292
I'm fine here...

33:14.376 --> 33:15.792
Christ almighty!

33:17.001 --> 33:20.459
Well, today will be quick.
Greta, Javier. Javier, Greta.

33:24.251 --> 33:27.501
It gave me...
a real fright, to be honest.

33:28.584 --> 33:30.917
I'd seen some,
but not that big.

33:31.001 --> 33:32.251
It's enormous.

33:33.501 --> 33:35.417
I mean, I love animals.

33:35.876 --> 33:37.626
I studied Biology.
I didn't finish it.

33:37.709 --> 33:40.001
I had an iguana when I was a kid.

33:40.084 --> 33:44.251
I remember once
I had it on my shoulder and it crapped.

33:44.709 --> 33:47.584
It crapped loads.
It did an enormous crap.

33:47.667 --> 33:50.876
The crap was as big as its body.

33:50.959 --> 33:53.084
Since then,
every time I see an iguana,

33:53.167 --> 33:57.417
I always imagine
it's crap will be as big as its body.

33:57.501 --> 33:58.209
Roughly.

33:58.292 --> 34:01.084
It's as if I dump
and it measures 180cm.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.042
What?

34:05.417 --> 34:07.292
The thing about the iguana.

34:08.292 --> 34:09.501
How long have you had it?

34:09.917 --> 34:10.708
Greta?

34:13.917 --> 34:15.626
- Are you okay?
- No, no. What's wrong?

34:15.708 --> 34:18.251
Calm down,
I just wanted to know its age...

34:18.333 --> 34:21.667
I can't hear you.
I can't hear you because I'm deaf.

34:21.751 --> 34:25.251
The battery is running out,
I'll go and change it.

34:25.417 --> 34:27.708
And since we're talking about things,

34:27.792 --> 34:30.501
apart from the hearing aid,

34:30.583 --> 34:35.167
I'm a coeliac, my feet smell
and I'm lactose intolerant...

34:37.542 --> 34:39.792
There's a taxi rank just in this street,

34:39.876 --> 34:43.458
in case you're in a rush or whatever.

34:50.876 --> 34:52.292
I've got a present.

34:55.417 --> 34:56.208
No!

34:57.083 --> 34:58.251
- No!
- Oh, yes!

35:09.501 --> 35:11.584
- What a time in London.
- Oh, God.

35:11.667 --> 35:13.167
What a disgusting village.

35:13.917 --> 35:15.167
Nata!

35:16.917 --> 35:17.917
We're coming!

35:18.292 --> 35:20.084
- Gorgeous!
- I love you!

35:23.209 --> 35:25.292
- How's it going with this one?
- He has a name,

35:25.417 --> 35:26.542
Alex.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.084
Really good.

35:28.792 --> 35:30.709
I'm so in love, Asun.

35:31.292 --> 35:34.792
I'd never felt like this.
I'm kind of connected to him.

35:34.876 --> 35:37.042
He spoils me, looks after me,

35:37.126 --> 35:39.251
I love him,
he loves me, he treats me well...

35:39.334 --> 35:41.167
- Great.
- Almost a year now.

35:41.251 --> 35:44.167
He's lasting a long time, then,
given what you're like.

35:46.417 --> 35:47.709
He's going to ask me to marry him.

35:47.792 --> 35:49.792
- What?
- On Saturday.

35:49.917 --> 35:52.084
It's our anniversary,
we're having dinner.

35:52.167 --> 35:53.542
I think he'll ask me.

35:53.626 --> 35:56.709
I'm longing for it,
but I don't want it to show.

35:56.834 --> 35:58.001
But...

35:58.792 --> 36:00.917
You haven't told him about us, have you?

36:01.001 --> 36:02.084
About what?

36:05.876 --> 36:08.084
I told him about the petrol station.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.876
Are you stupid or what?

36:09.959 --> 36:12.959
Why did you tell him?
They needn't know everything.

36:13.376 --> 36:16.626
Besides, what was it?
A bit of harpaxophilia?

36:16.751 --> 36:19.792
That's all, because they attacked you
and we realised.

36:19.876 --> 36:22.334
-It's not just harpaxophilia.
- Well,

36:22.417 --> 36:26.209
you get dendrophilia occasionally
when the summers are intense.

36:26.417 --> 36:27.459
Nothing else.

36:27.542 --> 36:31.001
I didn't tell Fernando anything.
Nothing at all until over a year.

36:31.417 --> 36:34.334
I told him about gran,
he still doesn't believe it.

36:34.417 --> 36:37.292
Well, I'm not like you,
I don't think that's right.

36:37.376 --> 36:39.667
If you're too sincere,
you'll get nowhere.

36:41.376 --> 36:45.251
Look, Pichu, I hope I'm wrong,
but this guy won't marry you.

36:46.167 --> 36:48.042
- Why?
- He looks like a whoremonger.

36:48.959 --> 36:51.834
- What?
- I'm telling you, I know these things.

36:51.917 --> 36:53.917
You don't even know him.

36:54.251 --> 36:57.584
If I'm wrong, at your hen party,
I'll wear a dick on my head.

36:57.667 --> 36:58.834
There you go.

36:58.917 --> 36:59.834
How's Natalia?

36:59.917 --> 37:01.251
Great, what can I say?

37:01.334 --> 37:02.709
Well...

37:02.917 --> 37:06.667
Besides,
Natalia looks to be a bit prude

37:06.751 --> 37:08.626
but then she surprises you.

37:09.209 --> 37:12.001
You know...?
- There's still a lot to surprise you.

37:12.084 --> 37:14.959
- Really?
- Yes, these sisters are...

37:15.042 --> 37:16.501
tremendous.
- Yes?

37:16.584 --> 37:17.959
- Tremendous.
- Sure.

37:18.042 --> 37:20.292
And it's not me.
This comes from way back.

37:20.376 --> 37:22.792
It runs in the family.

37:23.584 --> 37:24.751
- Yes.
- You know?

37:24.834 --> 37:26.167
I think I get you.

37:26.251 --> 37:28.459
There's nothing more to be said then.

37:28.834 --> 37:31.751
You know what I'm talking about...

37:33.001 --> 37:34.501
No?
- Yes, yes.

37:34.584 --> 37:36.751
Look here, listen carefully.

37:37.126 --> 37:39.126
If they get something into their heads,

37:39.209 --> 37:41.459
you can't refuse,
you can't say no.

37:42.167 --> 37:44.084
I almost got divorced.

37:44.626 --> 37:46.417
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

37:49.251 --> 37:50.626
- Hi.
- Hi, love.

37:50.709 --> 37:52.376
I'll leave this over here.

37:52.542 --> 37:54.584
How are you?
- Chardonnay.

37:55.542 --> 37:58.751
So, has he pestered you with the birds?

37:58.834 --> 38:00.584
No, I like them actually.

38:00.667 --> 38:03.376
Yes, I'm sure you think
we're a mad family.

38:04.834 --> 38:05.709
No, no.

38:06.917 --> 38:08.959
Which do you prefer?
Alex or Alejandro?

38:10.417 --> 38:13.542
- Alejandro, I don't know.
- Like Alejandro Magno.

38:13.834 --> 38:15.459
No?
- Yes.

38:16.084 --> 38:17.126
He was gay.

38:18.834 --> 38:21.376
Did you know that?
- No, I didn't.

38:21.584 --> 38:22.834
Now you know.

38:23.917 --> 38:26.917
Well, when is the wedding?

38:29.084 --> 38:30.167
The wedding?

38:31.042 --> 38:32.167
Well...

38:32.459 --> 38:34.834
I don't think
we're the marriage type, are we?

38:35.792 --> 38:36.459
Eh?

38:41.417 --> 38:42.501
If you say so.

38:43.292 --> 38:45.209
Or are we, my love?

38:45.917 --> 38:47.876
Yes, we aren't the marriage type.

38:49.792 --> 38:51.626
That's all.
- Nata.

38:53.042 --> 38:56.042
I'm going to charge my phone,
the battery has run out.

38:59.917 --> 39:01.792
- Is she annoyed?
- No.

39:01.876 --> 39:06.126
- She has outbursts.
- Yes, the sisters have a temper.

39:40.001 --> 39:40.917
What's he doing?

39:48.459 --> 39:50.542
This is a holdup!

39:53.167 --> 39:55.042
Mad! I'm mad!
- You're...

39:55.251 --> 39:56.834
You're hurting me!

39:58.459 --> 39:59.251
Dammit.

40:00.917 --> 40:02.334
It's me, Nata.

40:02.709 --> 40:07.001
I knew it was you, dammit.
I saw you and I could smell you.

40:07.917 --> 40:09.001
Dammit, look.

40:09.876 --> 40:11.042
Well I never!

40:11.417 --> 40:13.959
I don't understand.
Isn't this what you wanted?

40:15.167 --> 40:17.334
- Not like this.
- How?

40:17.417 --> 40:18.751
My love, it's okay.

40:18.834 --> 40:20.209
How? Tell me.

40:21.042 --> 40:23.376
As always, you're...

40:23.459 --> 40:25.167
Not for this kind of thing...

40:25.251 --> 40:26.209
Come on...

40:26.292 --> 40:28.292
Hey, it's not funny, girl.

40:28.792 --> 40:30.251
Honestly.
- No...

40:30.709 --> 40:31.751
Alex.

40:32.001 --> 40:32.792
Alex!

40:45.584 --> 40:46.876
Just look at her.

40:47.876 --> 40:49.292
If I'd known...

40:54.084 --> 40:56.751
Fuck, he's cut me short.
Fuck!

40:57.667 --> 40:58.876
And?
What do you reckon?

40:59.834 --> 41:03.584
The shorts from Tangiers
aren't really fetish to be honest.

41:03.667 --> 41:06.917
- I don't know what to wear.
- The party is Latex Disco.

41:07.001 --> 41:08.876
- Yes.
- The dress code is:

41:09.251 --> 41:10.792
Latex...
- We haven't got any.

41:10.876 --> 41:11.542
No.

41:11.626 --> 41:13.417
Fetish or complete nude.

41:13.501 --> 41:15.542
We aren't going naked, I'm not.

41:15.626 --> 41:18.001
- Fetish then.
- I don't know what it is.

41:18.292 --> 41:21.584
High-heeled shoes...
I don't know either.

41:22.459 --> 41:24.251
I'll die
if I see someone from the PTA.

41:24.334 --> 41:26.542
Ana,
if you don't want to go, we won't.

41:26.626 --> 41:27.709
Do you want to go or not?

41:27.792 --> 41:29.751
- No!
- We won't go then.

41:32.626 --> 41:34.251
Good evening.
Password?

41:35.167 --> 41:36.751
- Belén didn't say.
- No.

41:36.917 --> 41:38.542
It's "Adela told me" but it will do.

41:38.626 --> 41:39.459
Come in.

41:41.542 --> 41:42.292
Come in.

41:42.376 --> 41:44.042
- Good evening.
- Hello.

41:44.126 --> 41:46.209
- So, you're Belen's friends?
- Yes.

41:46.292 --> 41:48.001
Well, there's the dressing room.

41:48.084 --> 41:51.501
If you want towels or condoms,
just ask me.

41:51.834 --> 41:54.042
- Thanks.
- Okay, bye for now.

41:54.126 --> 41:55.209
Like this?

41:58.584 --> 42:00.459
- Hello.
- Hi.

42:00.542 --> 42:03.876
- Do I get changed here?
- Yes, right here.

42:10.417 --> 42:12.251
-It's okay?
- Yes, it's okay.

42:12.459 --> 42:14.751
- Don't leave your bag.
- No way.

42:14.834 --> 42:15.792
Let's go.

42:21.501 --> 42:22.667
Bloody hell!

42:24.084 --> 42:25.417
What's he doing?

42:31.209 --> 42:32.459
Fuck, there are all sorts here.

42:33.334 --> 42:34.167
Carry on.

42:34.251 --> 42:36.834
I'm dressed like Heidi,
I look like a...

42:36.917 --> 42:38.792
Ass, ass, ass, ass.

42:40.959 --> 42:42.167
Bloody hell!

42:43.334 --> 42:45.167
Head for the bar, the bar.

42:57.209 --> 42:59.334
What shall I get you?

43:00.876 --> 43:01.959
Gin tonic.

43:02.751 --> 43:03.667
A short one.

43:03.751 --> 43:05.959
A short gin tonic
and a Brugal and Coke.

43:06.042 --> 43:06.959
Right away.

43:11.042 --> 43:12.167
Bloody hell.

43:13.292 --> 43:14.542
Was that a girl?

43:15.584 --> 43:18.042
- Possibly.
- That's a girl, Ana.

43:18.126 --> 43:19.917
Here you are.

43:20.334 --> 43:22.084
Gin tonic and Brugal.

43:22.459 --> 43:25.792
Ten and ten, twenty.
Fancy a tear drop?

43:25.876 --> 43:27.584
You don't come here to cry.

43:27.667 --> 43:28.542
No, no.

43:29.876 --> 43:31.542
- Twenty.
- Okay.

43:32.167 --> 43:33.667
You don't know what it is.

43:34.001 --> 43:36.001
They drug you and...

43:40.709 --> 43:42.209
One to the left.

43:42.292 --> 43:44.001
Don't look, don't look.
She's looking.

43:45.209 --> 43:46.792
Don't look, don't look.

43:48.959 --> 43:52.376
She's still looking.
- Don't you look.

43:56.084 --> 43:58.459
Look, do you like those earrings?

44:01.209 --> 44:02.834
No, that's enough.

44:02.917 --> 44:05.167
Don't laugh,Paco.
It's a lack of respect.

44:05.251 --> 44:08.459
Stop it, they'll throw us out.

44:09.126 --> 44:11.542
Don't...
Leave it out or we're going.

44:11.626 --> 44:13.751
- I'm going to the toilet.
- No, hey!

44:18.126 --> 44:19.876
- A beer.
- Okay.

44:23.501 --> 44:25.042
It's smoky.

44:26.209 --> 44:28.709
Everything okay?
- It is now.

44:31.001 --> 44:32.751
- Are you waiting?
- Yes.

44:38.542 --> 44:40.709
Hey, mate,
can I ask you a question?

44:40.792 --> 44:41.709
Sure.

44:43.167 --> 44:45.876
Did you play in the five-a-side league
in Torrelodones?

44:46.751 --> 44:48.709
Yes, I played last year.

44:48.792 --> 44:52.042
- Last year.
- Yes, only two or three matches.

44:52.126 --> 44:53.542
I played with you.

44:53.626 --> 44:55.126
- Really?
- Yes.

44:55.376 --> 44:58.084
Do you remember the match
when we thrashed you?

44:58.167 --> 45:00.917
- Hell! It was 3-0.
- That one, that one.

45:01.001 --> 45:03.584
Yes, right.
Of course. Yes, yes.

45:03.667 --> 45:05.709
We couldn't have been worse.

45:07.126 --> 45:11.084
Get on all fours, you whore,
I've been watching you a while.

45:15.917 --> 45:17.792
- Want to try?
- No, thanks.

45:17.876 --> 45:20.209
- Your turn, come on.
- No, thanks. Really.

45:20.292 --> 45:22.834
- Go on.
- I'm fine here with my drink.

45:22.917 --> 45:25.334
-It's easy.
- I've got a glass in my hand.

45:25.417 --> 45:26.709
I can't, thanks.

45:27.042 --> 45:29.417
It's the first time we've come here...

45:29.584 --> 45:32.084
It's a curious place.

45:33.334 --> 45:35.542
- Are you going for a pee?
- Yes, I am.

45:37.459 --> 45:40.542
- Would you mind peeing on me?
- Sorry?

45:40.917 --> 45:43.209
Could you pee on me?

45:47.084 --> 45:48.876
No way, mate, I...

45:49.667 --> 45:51.417
Those kinds of things...

45:52.251 --> 45:54.917
I mean, I know people and that,
but I don't...

45:55.167 --> 45:59.209
I have respect,
but I don't do it, I don't...

45:59.292 --> 46:01.792
I mean, for friendship's sake.
Without...

46:02.876 --> 46:06.417
We know each other,
we've played five-a-side together.

46:06.501 --> 46:08.959
Yeah, sure, it's just that I...

46:09.042 --> 46:11.334
I know it's daft, but...

46:12.334 --> 46:15.209
I'm not used to it,
you know what I mean?

46:15.292 --> 46:17.251
It's not that difficult, dammit.

46:21.917 --> 46:23.417
It's just that...

46:24.501 --> 46:26.376
It won't come out, mate.
I'm sorry.

46:26.459 --> 46:28.042
Okay, fine.

46:29.917 --> 46:30.917
No worries.

46:36.209 --> 46:37.417
Did that hurt, sir?

46:41.667 --> 46:42.334
Fine.

46:42.417 --> 46:45.167
- You have to move your arm.
- No, I feel a bit dizzy.

46:45.251 --> 46:48.792
- Are you all right? What's wrong?
- No, I feel a bit...

46:49.709 --> 46:50.542
Ana?

46:50.959 --> 46:53.084
Ana!
- Oh, Belén.

46:53.167 --> 46:55.709
- What's happened?
- I'm a bit dizzy.

46:55.792 --> 46:58.459
Come, come, come.
Come and sit down.

46:58.584 --> 47:00.626
My God.
What has happened to you?

47:00.709 --> 47:03.251
I don't know if it was the gin tonic,

47:04.417 --> 47:08.959
or that man and his buttocks...

47:09.042 --> 47:10.876
- Yes, it's all...
- The heat.

47:11.334 --> 47:14.751
And the place is overwhelming,
perhaps, the first time.

47:14.834 --> 47:15.667
Maybe.

47:16.834 --> 47:18.917
- What a fright, Ana.
- Yes.

47:19.001 --> 47:20.167
It was really.

47:20.751 --> 47:25.084
- Have you come on your own?
- No, Paco is in the toilets.

47:25.167 --> 47:26.834
He's taking so long.

47:28.376 --> 47:29.917
Go on, mate, just a bit.

47:30.001 --> 47:31.251
- Fuck...
- Go on.

47:37.626 --> 47:38.584
Hang on.

47:39.917 --> 47:41.084
- There.
- That's it?

47:41.167 --> 47:43.959
Don't leave me like this, mate.
Go on, some more.

47:44.042 --> 47:46.917
Now you're here, mate, give me some.
Come on, mate!

47:47.001 --> 47:50.417
Come on! Do it, mate.
- No, you'll see...

47:51.709 --> 47:52.876
Go, go, go.

47:53.376 --> 47:54.417
So warm.

47:54.501 --> 47:56.751
Those gin tonics.

47:56.834 --> 47:59.084
My girl is young and doesn't drink.

48:05.167 --> 48:07.084
It's really warm in here.

48:07.834 --> 48:10.876
I'll tell them to turn on the air con,
it's so hot...

48:13.042 --> 48:14.251
In the end...

48:18.834 --> 48:21.626
- Thanks.
- No worries, mate.

48:22.501 --> 48:24.792
- I'm grateful to you.
- That's okay.

48:25.167 --> 48:26.251
Okay then.

48:26.584 --> 48:29.709
Come over to Torrelodones
and we'll play a quick match.

48:29.792 --> 48:31.917
- Sure, I'll see you there.
- Okay.

48:32.001 --> 48:34.376
- See you.
- See you, mate. A pleasure.

48:52.542 --> 48:54.917
- Well, if you ask me...
- We'll go, won't we?

48:55.001 --> 48:56.876
- Yes. Come on.
- Let's go.

49:42.959 --> 49:46.626
"Lord Jesus Christ,
you said to your apostles:

49:46.709 --> 49:49.251
I leave you peace,
my peace I give you.

49:49.542 --> 49:53.667
Look not on our sins,
but on the faith of your Church,

49:53.792 --> 49:56.376
and grant peace
and unity of your kingdom

49:57.042 --> 50:00.084
where you live forever and ever.

50:00.292 --> 50:01.167
Amen.

50:01.292 --> 50:04.084
The Peace of the Lord
be with you always."

50:04.167 --> 50:07.001
- And also with you.
- Let's offer each other a sign of peace.

50:17.084 --> 50:19.751
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

50:27.292 --> 50:29.917
- Do you want some water?
- No.

50:33.501 --> 50:36.042
Antonio, dear,
if you have to cry, cry.

50:36.126 --> 50:38.834
There's nothing wrong in crying,
okay?

50:38.917 --> 50:40.626
I don't want to cry anymore.

50:42.251 --> 50:43.542
Who loves you?

50:43.876 --> 50:45.667
- You.
- There you go.

50:47.709 --> 50:50.084
Shall we watch a film
to keep you occupied?

50:50.167 --> 50:53.709
The one about the lad in the war,
<i>Life is Beautiful</i> ?

50:55.626 --> 50:58.042
Or the one about the Germans,
 <i>Schindler's List?</i>

50:58.209 --> 51:00.376
No, forget films.
Football is on later.

51:04.126 --> 51:06.334
Antonio,
you haven't eaten all day.

51:06.459 --> 51:08.667
Honey, shall I do you
some tuna and onion?

51:08.751 --> 51:10.292
Come and help me to peel and cut it.

51:10.376 --> 51:12.876
Come on.
- No, I can't eat.

51:13.667 --> 51:17.167
You eat whatever,
I'll have some melon or something.

51:27.376 --> 51:28.834
Antonio.

51:29.876 --> 51:33.417
Look what I've found.
What a shame.

51:34.876 --> 51:35.917
Look.

51:36.084 --> 51:37.334
What a pity.

51:37.917 --> 51:39.417
Not even thirty.

51:40.001 --> 51:42.209
Didn't smoke or drink.

51:45.251 --> 51:46.209
Well I never.

51:46.501 --> 51:48.084
Where's that from?

51:48.667 --> 51:49.834
This?

51:53.751 --> 51:56.292
Do you know
what his wife told me in church?

51:56.792 --> 51:58.501
She's four months pregnant.

52:02.209 --> 52:04.792
Antonio, darling.

52:05.126 --> 52:06.251
Okay.

52:06.584 --> 52:08.084
Let it out.

52:08.292 --> 52:10.376
Okay, honey.
Okay.

52:12.417 --> 52:13.542
Okay.

52:15.626 --> 52:17.876
Okay.
- What the hell are you doing?

52:20.084 --> 52:21.667
I'm not up to this.

52:33.959 --> 52:37.584
Yes, yes, my girl.
Who loves you?

52:38.084 --> 52:39.667
You understand me.

52:40.667 --> 52:41.834
Blanki...

52:42.917 --> 52:46.334
"Whilst you live under my roof,
knickers aren't sold in my house."

52:46.584 --> 52:49.126
Do you know what?
She's gone to a friend's house.

52:50.917 --> 52:52.792
She doesn't know me.

52:52.876 --> 52:55.459
Come on, Maite,
the girl is an adult.

52:56.459 --> 52:59.042
She earns some money
to pay for her studies,

52:59.542 --> 53:00.834
she does no harm.

53:02.126 --> 53:03.334
What's so bad?

53:04.751 --> 53:06.126
She may enjoy it.

53:07.417 --> 53:09.917
We're modern
with everything but our kids.

53:10.251 --> 53:11.209
Pass me the chisel.

53:14.126 --> 53:17.042
You have to respect
the fantasies of others.

53:20.334 --> 53:21.126
God!

55:19.042 --> 55:20.084
Lore, what time is it?

55:20.167 --> 55:23.626
Almost one o'clock, madam.
It's very late.

55:25.542 --> 55:28.251
- I've slept a lot, no?
- Yes, a lot, madam.

55:28.667 --> 55:30.459
Would you like a coffee?

55:32.501 --> 55:33.751
Lore, come here.

55:34.209 --> 55:36.126
Come, please.
- Yes, madam.

55:36.959 --> 55:38.751
Are you all right, madam?

55:41.626 --> 55:42.292
No.

55:43.792 --> 55:45.501
I don't feel well at all.

55:46.626 --> 55:47.292
No.

55:50.959 --> 55:52.876
Sit down a moment, please.

55:58.751 --> 55:59.709
Well...

56:01.292 --> 56:03.334
I feel odd.

56:04.667 --> 56:07.001
I feel as though...

56:09.751 --> 56:11.959
I have a sensation...

56:14.334 --> 56:16.209
Nothing, forget it.

56:16.584 --> 56:19.167
Go and prepare some coffee.
- Okay, madam.

56:25.209 --> 56:29.459
Sir, I think madam is suspicious.

56:37.667 --> 56:38.751
Of what?

56:39.626 --> 56:40.626
Suspicious?

56:40.709 --> 56:43.126
Nothing, sir.
Nothing, sorry.

56:48.917 --> 56:51.584
One thing, sir.

56:52.376 --> 56:54.834
Forget about the boob operation.

56:55.542 --> 56:59.042
I haven't enough money to pay for it.

57:02.251 --> 57:05.126
- How much have you got?
- Only one thousand euros.

57:05.584 --> 57:06.417
Right.

57:07.834 --> 57:11.042
We can sort that out.
- Thank you, sir.

57:17.501 --> 57:19.542
Tell me,
have you got a boyfriend?

57:19.626 --> 57:21.042
- Yes.
- Yes?

57:22.667 --> 57:25.917
- Has your friend got a boyfriend?
- We have the same boyfriend.

57:27.001 --> 57:29.751
Luna, I'm getting out,
I'm freezing to death.

57:29.834 --> 57:32.292
Look at my hands,
all wrinkled, my God.

57:33.209 --> 57:35.876
It's so cold!

57:37.626 --> 57:38.917
Look at my...

57:39.667 --> 57:40.751
I'm freezing.

57:40.834 --> 57:43.542
- Let's have a water fight.
- Now?

57:59.876 --> 58:01.251
Was the tabbouleh nice?

58:01.334 --> 58:03.042
Nice and cool.
- Delicious.

58:03.126 --> 58:04.626
Incredible, really.

58:05.376 --> 58:07.417
Luna, you little bugger!

58:07.501 --> 58:10.334
No!
Wait, mine doesn't work!

58:10.417 --> 58:12.501
Take that!
- No. Hey!

58:13.376 --> 58:15.751
My God!
It's freezing!

58:15.959 --> 58:17.584
Take that!
- No. Hey!

58:17.667 --> 58:18.834
I'm winning.

58:20.167 --> 58:22.959
Luna, I'll get stomach cramp!
Please!

58:25.042 --> 58:28.292
Okay, okay.
Luna! That's enough!

58:28.542 --> 58:30.209
Okay!
Siesta, no?

58:30.292 --> 58:32.667
It's late, it's hot.
- Right, yes.

58:32.751 --> 58:35.417
Come on, Luna.
Let's have a nap.

58:35.501 --> 58:38.792
No, Ana, I'll take her.
I'll have a little nap too.

58:38.959 --> 58:41.959
Right, love, sleep time.
We'll carry on tomorrow.

58:42.084 --> 58:44.542
Up you get!
I'll take this little rat.

58:44.667 --> 58:45.917
Oh, my God!

58:47.209 --> 58:49.292
God, I'm so hot.

59:23.376 --> 59:25.417
Paco, we have to talk.

59:26.751 --> 59:28.459
- What about?
- Belén.

59:28.709 --> 59:29.751
She gets me going.

59:30.334 --> 59:32.792
Gets you going where?

59:33.167 --> 59:34.584
She turns me on.

59:36.584 --> 59:37.834
I like her...

59:38.709 --> 59:41.376
You mean you like her...

59:42.126 --> 59:45.417
in an erotic fantasy way
or you really like her?

59:46.501 --> 59:50.334
In the sadist party,
she gave me a bit of a kiss.

59:51.126 --> 59:53.709
- What, what, what?
- A little kiss, Paco.

59:53.834 --> 59:58.626
She gave me a kiss
and it kind of affected me.

59:59.167 --> 01:00:00.959
Since when have you liked women?

01:00:01.042 --> 01:00:03.126
No, I'm confused.

01:00:03.251 --> 01:00:06.917
No, it's not that I...
I don't know, I've no idea.

01:00:07.042 --> 01:00:12.084
As a girl,
I remember kissing, to try.

01:00:12.167 --> 01:00:14.459
But not...
I don't know what it is.

01:00:16.959 --> 01:00:18.792
Ana, are you telling me...

01:00:20.042 --> 01:00:21.084
you're a lesbian?

01:00:22.292 --> 01:00:24.792
- No.
- That might be what's wrong with us.

01:00:24.876 --> 01:00:28.209
No, I wanted to tell you.
I didn't want to keep it to myself.

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:31.334
We're doing
that shit therapy like idiots.

01:00:33.709 --> 01:00:35.917
No, I'm sure I want to be with you.

01:00:36.001 --> 01:00:38.542
If I'm lesbian, I'll bear it.
I don't know.

01:00:43.709 --> 01:00:45.376
But...
- No, leave me.

01:00:57.709 --> 01:00:59.667
Can you pass me
the photo with no filter?

01:00:59.751 --> 01:01:01.667
I've told you dozens of times.
- I already have.

01:01:01.751 --> 01:01:04.084
- No, with no filter.
- I'll send it, wait.

01:01:04.167 --> 01:01:05.001
Okay.

01:01:05.792 --> 01:01:07.126
How nice.

01:01:08.126 --> 01:01:10.917
This will get me lots of likes,
which is what I like.

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:12.876
Followers no, likes yes.

01:01:13.626 --> 01:01:14.709
Of course.

01:01:17.292 --> 01:01:20.501
Adriana and David are getting married,
and he's a haemophiliac.

01:01:20.584 --> 01:01:22.417
If they love each other.

01:01:23.417 --> 01:01:24.292
Yes.

01:01:26.417 --> 01:01:27.876
I think the same.

01:01:28.667 --> 01:01:30.584
Darling, why don't you fart with me?

01:01:33.042 --> 01:01:35.501
Not that again.
That's enough, please.

01:01:35.584 --> 01:01:37.084
- Why?
- They don't come.

01:01:37.209 --> 01:01:39.001
Have you farted with others?

01:01:39.334 --> 01:01:40.292
No.

01:01:40.792 --> 01:01:43.209
I don't know,
in my sleep maybe.

01:01:43.292 --> 01:01:46.334
I don't know,
I think that when a couple

01:01:46.417 --> 01:01:48.876
crosses the fart barrier,
things are progressing.

01:01:48.959 --> 01:01:51.542
So, you think farting

01:01:51.626 --> 01:01:54.459
is a sign that...?
Give me time...

01:01:55.751 --> 01:01:57.001
and one day...

01:01:57.084 --> 01:01:59.792
I'll give you something else, look.

01:02:00.167 --> 01:02:01.376
- Yes?
- Yes.

01:02:01.459 --> 01:02:02.251
What?

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:10.876
I don't know if you'll like it.

01:02:11.584 --> 01:02:12.917
I don't believe it.

01:02:13.792 --> 01:02:14.876
Really?

01:02:14.959 --> 01:02:17.209
- It might not be the right choice.
- Yes.

01:02:20.876 --> 01:02:22.751
- Earrings!
- Yes.

01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:28.001
- I love them!
- Tell the camera you like them.

01:02:28.167 --> 01:02:30.876
I love the earrings.

01:02:32.126 --> 01:02:34.542
Can I ask you a question?
- Yes, sure.

01:02:34.959 --> 01:02:37.167
Have you ever been with a prostitute?

01:02:38.501 --> 01:02:40.501
Who told you that?

01:02:41.209 --> 01:02:42.084
That's a yes.

01:02:42.167 --> 01:02:44.376
No, but I don't know
why you're asking me.

01:02:44.459 --> 01:02:47.251
- Yes or no?
- No, I haven't.

01:02:47.501 --> 01:02:50.876
We went to a whorehouse
in Tenerife, in Tacoronte once,

01:02:50.959 --> 01:02:53.376
to have a drink, but that was all.

01:02:53.876 --> 01:02:56.459
In fact,
there was a girl called "The Syphon".

01:02:56.751 --> 01:02:58.876
Because she sucked them...

01:03:00.834 --> 01:03:03.167
and squirted the sperm through her nose.

01:03:08.459 --> 01:03:10.709
It's great.
- Awful.

01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:16.209
Where did your sister get that
about Alejandro Magno being gay?

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:19.167
I don't know,
she must have seen a documentary.

01:03:19.251 --> 01:03:20.542
That's my sister.

01:03:20.792 --> 01:03:23.626
Well, she's wrong,
internet says he was bisexual.

01:03:23.751 --> 01:03:25.251
Got a coin for the car park?

01:03:27.626 --> 01:03:29.001
No, we haven't, no.

01:03:31.667 --> 01:03:32.917
We've nothing.

01:03:33.917 --> 01:03:35.792
Come on, you must have.

01:03:38.126 --> 01:03:39.751
Give him whatever.

01:03:44.876 --> 01:03:47.042
Here, thirty euros.
It's all I have.

01:03:50.584 --> 01:03:51.959
You've nothing else?

01:03:52.084 --> 01:03:54.292
I said I've given you all I had.

01:03:59.959 --> 01:04:01.084
You've got something else.

01:04:24.459 --> 01:04:25.542
Wait, wait.

01:04:36.834 --> 01:04:38.251
Alejandro!

01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:40.417
Alejandro!

01:04:41.334 --> 01:04:42.542
Alejandro!

01:04:44.001 --> 01:04:45.459
Alejandro!

01:04:46.167 --> 01:04:47.542
Alejandro!

01:05:05.876 --> 01:05:08.917
When I was fifteen I liked my teacher.

01:05:10.292 --> 01:05:12.376
At twenty, Italians.

01:05:12.792 --> 01:05:15.584
Then you go the gynaecologist
and you fall in love with him.

01:05:15.667 --> 01:05:17.876
Now I'm fifty, thirty-year-old guys.

01:05:47.334 --> 01:05:50.834
Calm down, it's polyester.
It's polyester.

01:05:51.334 --> 01:05:54.376
It might be polyester.
It's polyester. It's polyester.

01:05:54.709 --> 01:05:56.542
No... It's silk.

01:05:58.626 --> 01:06:00.626
It's silk.
It's silk.

01:06:01.292 --> 01:06:03.542
Calm down, don't do it.
Don't do it.

01:06:05.167 --> 01:06:06.251
Don't do it.

01:06:09.751 --> 01:06:10.709
Sorry.

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:12.292
Sorry.

01:06:12.751 --> 01:06:13.792
Sorry.

01:06:31.459 --> 01:06:34.251
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

01:06:35.251 --> 01:06:36.417
I'm great.

01:06:49.709 --> 01:06:52.542
- How many brothers have you got?
- There are four of us.

01:06:52.834 --> 01:06:54.959
- Have you got children?
- No, I haven't.

01:06:55.042 --> 01:06:57.501
- Why? Are you too young?
- Yes, I'm young.

01:06:58.917 --> 01:07:00.667
I can't tell with the Chinese.

01:07:00.751 --> 01:07:02.542
I'm not Chinese, I'm Ecuadoran.

01:07:03.834 --> 01:07:05.376
You look Chinese.

01:07:08.834 --> 01:07:10.084
Oh, Toñi.

01:07:11.876 --> 01:07:13.042
What's wrong?

01:07:15.917 --> 01:07:17.042
What?

01:07:17.584 --> 01:07:19.917
Hang on, Chink.
The dog has escaped?

01:07:20.709 --> 01:07:23.251
Toñi, the one favour I ask you.

01:07:25.459 --> 01:07:26.876
Listen to me carefully,

01:07:26.959 --> 01:07:30.792
Antonio must never know
that I left the dog with you.

01:07:33.751 --> 01:07:34.417
No.

01:07:35.376 --> 01:07:38.334
Whatever happens,
the dog has never been in your house.

01:07:39.792 --> 01:07:40.917
Swear to me.

01:07:42.001 --> 01:07:44.042
Let me hear you swear to me, Toñi.

01:07:45.834 --> 01:07:49.584
If it turns up, call me.
If not, don't call me, I'll call you.

01:07:57.126 --> 01:07:57.917
Antonio.

01:07:59.334 --> 01:08:00.376
Any news?

01:08:02.084 --> 01:08:04.417
Any news about the dog?
Has anyone called?

01:08:05.376 --> 01:08:06.251
Where were you?

01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:08.584
- Where?
- Where the hell have you been?

01:08:09.584 --> 01:08:10.834
Sticking the dog posters up.

01:08:10.917 --> 01:08:14.459
Bollocks!
The dog posters? What's this?

01:08:15.792 --> 01:08:18.542
Can you explain it to me?
I found it in a dustbin.

01:08:19.084 --> 01:08:20.167
Explain it to me.

01:08:23.501 --> 01:08:24.792
Where's Blanki?

01:08:25.792 --> 01:08:28.126
- Antonio...
- What have you done with the dog?

01:08:29.501 --> 01:08:31.834
You think
I've done something to the dog?

01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:35.167
It kills me.
- Don't lie to me.

01:08:35.917 --> 01:08:37.001
Don't lie.

01:08:38.626 --> 01:08:39.626
Antonio.

01:08:40.626 --> 01:08:44.209
I swear by my grandmother's grave
I don't know where the dog is.

01:08:44.292 --> 01:08:47.501
I don't know what's wrong
but you've been odd for days.

01:08:47.584 --> 01:08:49.501
You don't fool me,
something is going on.

01:08:51.501 --> 01:08:53.209
What the hell is going on?

01:08:55.001 --> 01:08:55.876
Tell me.

01:08:58.209 --> 01:09:00.251
Antonio, I don't know how to.

01:09:00.334 --> 01:09:03.042
I knew there was something.
I knew it.

01:09:08.959 --> 01:09:11.501
I should have told you
the first day, Antonio.

01:09:11.751 --> 01:09:13.001
I'm dead scared.

01:09:15.042 --> 01:09:16.167
I'm not well.

01:09:20.251 --> 01:09:21.667
I'm ill.

01:09:23.251 --> 01:09:24.334
It's not cancer...

01:09:29.834 --> 01:09:30.667
Cancer?

01:09:33.459 --> 01:09:35.292
Yes, it's cancer.

01:09:36.126 --> 01:09:38.209
They've found a lump in my breast,

01:09:38.292 --> 01:09:40.751
they're doing tests and things, but...

01:09:42.334 --> 01:09:43.292
It's cancer.

01:09:48.334 --> 01:09:49.751
I'm so sorry.

01:09:58.959 --> 01:10:01.292
Everything will be all right.
You'll see.

01:10:01.376 --> 01:10:03.709
It doesn't look good, Antonio.

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:05.542
No.

01:10:06.417 --> 01:10:08.667
- No.
- No.

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:14.251
Antonio, Antonio, Antonio...

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:15.917
Antonio!

01:10:18.084 --> 01:10:19.001
Password.

01:10:19.084 --> 01:10:21.292
Stop messing.
Open up, it's me.

01:10:24.542 --> 01:10:26.917
Can I talk to you a minute?
- Yes.

01:10:27.001 --> 01:10:29.876
There's a furry party, but come in.

01:10:34.292 --> 01:10:38.084
- These guys?
- They like this lark.

01:10:41.501 --> 01:10:42.792
What's up, Paco?
You've got me...

01:10:42.876 --> 01:10:45.501
- Hasn't Ana said anything?
- Ana? No, what about?

01:10:45.584 --> 01:10:46.709
No?

01:10:47.251 --> 01:10:48.834
What's happened?

01:10:49.001 --> 01:10:53.334
No, this afternoon she told me...
that you turn her on.

01:10:54.126 --> 01:10:55.334
- What?
- She likes you.

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:57.709
She gets horny with you.

01:10:57.792 --> 01:10:59.709
- Me?
- You, you.

01:11:00.501 --> 01:11:01.917
Seriously?

01:11:02.001 --> 01:11:04.126
How sweet.
I can't believe it.

01:11:04.209 --> 01:11:05.542
What did she say about me?

01:11:05.626 --> 01:11:08.417
I had an erotic dream
about her the other day.

01:11:08.501 --> 01:11:11.167
But real, real, real.

01:11:11.292 --> 01:11:14.167
We sucked boobs
and ate pussy on your terrace.

01:11:14.251 --> 01:11:15.251
Like real.

01:11:15.334 --> 01:11:18.292
Titch, do you think
what I'm telling you is normal?

01:11:18.376 --> 01:11:20.084
Sorry, it wasn't the right time.

01:11:21.001 --> 01:11:25.417
How did all this come about?
- I don't know, you tell me.

01:11:26.501 --> 01:11:27.876
You kissed her,

01:11:27.959 --> 01:11:29.584
the other night in here.

01:11:29.667 --> 01:11:31.584
- Again, again...
- No, Belén.

01:11:31.667 --> 01:11:33.126
No, Paco, again?

01:11:33.251 --> 01:11:34.751
- Again?
- We know each other.

01:11:34.834 --> 01:11:37.126
Exactly, we know each other.
I can't believe it.

01:11:37.209 --> 01:11:39.959
I kissed her, Paco,
I kissed your wife,

01:11:40.042 --> 01:11:42.834
she was stumbling around
in a real dizzy state.

01:11:42.917 --> 01:11:45.334
A kiss to comfort her, not...

01:11:45.751 --> 01:11:48.042
A comfort kiss, a...

01:11:48.584 --> 01:11:51.167
No tongue or...
Like this...

01:11:55.584 --> 01:11:58.917
Girl, don't kiss me,
I'm already in a mess,

01:11:59.001 --> 01:12:02.251
and this tops it all.
- Sorry, sorry.

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:05.126
Sorry.
- People don't keep to the rules.

01:12:06.626 --> 01:12:07.709
Honey,

01:12:08.834 --> 01:12:12.459
put this on at least,
you're the odd one out.

01:12:14.876 --> 01:12:17.292
When did she start?

01:12:18.126 --> 01:12:21.667
- Did she...?
- She never has, as far as I know.

01:12:21.876 --> 01:12:25.084
She isn't lesbian with me,
she's normal with me.

01:12:25.167 --> 01:12:26.584
But, have you ever...?

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:30.792
I mean,
there are sometimes signs, right?

01:12:30.876 --> 01:12:32.709
- Signs of what?
- Signs...

01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:36.584
that she likes women perhaps.

01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:40.834
Other than her strange way
of giving me a blow job.

01:12:41.667 --> 01:12:44.417
No, Belén.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:12:44.542 --> 01:12:46.709
I'm not saying...
No, no, no.

01:12:47.584 --> 01:12:51.084
No, no, listen, honey.
She might be bi.

01:12:51.251 --> 01:12:52.251
Bi?

01:12:54.959 --> 01:12:56.876
I hope so, you know what I mean?

01:12:57.792 --> 01:12:58.751
I hope so.

01:13:00.501 --> 01:13:01.959
Hey, please, no.

01:13:02.042 --> 01:13:05.084
Hey, I'm telling you.
If you want lemons, ask me for them.

01:13:05.167 --> 01:13:06.876
They take lemons like...

01:13:12.126 --> 01:13:15.001
I think the one in pink
is Lucia Etxebarria.

01:13:16.834 --> 01:13:19.167
Go to bed with her.
- With who?

01:13:19.251 --> 01:13:21.251
With Ana.
Go to bed with her.

01:13:21.751 --> 01:13:22.501
What?

01:13:22.584 --> 01:13:24.792
- Belén, listen a minute.
- Paco...

01:13:24.876 --> 01:13:28.167
Listen to me, titch.
She has to try it.

01:13:28.334 --> 01:13:31.417
And who better than you, girl?
You're a pal.

01:13:31.501 --> 01:13:34.584
Titch, you've touched a lot.
You know how to touch,

01:13:34.667 --> 01:13:38.292
and you can tell if she is or not.
- Paco, those games...

01:13:39.751 --> 01:13:44.417
I get affectionate too soon.
I fall in love quickly, I can't...

01:13:45.334 --> 01:13:47.251
Belén, I'm pleading you.

01:13:48.626 --> 01:13:50.501
Do you think I'm not scared?

01:13:51.584 --> 01:13:53.126
I'm scared shitless.

01:13:57.209 --> 01:13:58.292
Paco, honey,

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:02.792
you've put me up in your house,
given me a roof, food...

01:14:04.209 --> 01:14:06.334
If you want me
to go to bed with your wife,

01:14:06.417 --> 01:14:09.417
I'll go to bed with her,
nothing more to be said.

01:14:10.751 --> 01:14:12.626
Come on, my sweetie.

01:14:14.042 --> 01:14:15.959
- Again.
- Sorry.

01:14:16.459 --> 01:14:18.834
Come on, let's have a drink.

01:14:18.917 --> 01:14:21.001
No,no,no.
These are very big.

01:14:21.751 --> 01:14:23.876
They wouldn't look right on you.

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:26.667
But please, sir,
I want to have big boobs.

01:14:26.751 --> 01:14:29.209
Have you seen this cup size?
Heads up.

01:14:32.667 --> 01:14:34.084
Where have you been?

01:14:36.042 --> 01:14:38.709
In the clinic.
What's wrong?

01:14:38.792 --> 01:14:40.667
That's what I say, what's wrong?

01:14:40.751 --> 01:14:42.459
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

01:14:42.917 --> 01:14:45.167
Well then, you can explain this to me.

01:14:45.834 --> 01:14:47.001
This.

01:14:48.042 --> 01:14:51.001
Lingerie, 150?.

01:14:52.917 --> 01:14:55.834
Body oils, 65?.

01:14:55.959 --> 01:14:58.084
Erotic toys, 200?.

01:14:59.709 --> 01:15:01.251
What's this, José Luis?

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:06.292
Do you think I'm daft?

01:15:17.876 --> 01:15:20.501
Who is she?
Is she from the clinic?

01:15:26.459 --> 01:15:27.834
Is she younger than me?

01:15:30.376 --> 01:15:31.334
Prettier?

01:15:35.001 --> 01:15:36.001
What's more...

01:15:40.376 --> 01:15:41.334
a coward.

01:15:48.209 --> 01:15:51.251
She isn't younger than you.
Or prettier.

01:15:53.417 --> 01:15:56.001
But she doesn't humiliate me
or harp on at me.

01:15:57.251 --> 01:15:59.709
She lets me hug and kiss her at night.

01:15:59.792 --> 01:16:01.292
Son of a bitch.

01:16:02.042 --> 01:16:03.917
Don't you realise, Paloma?

01:16:04.542 --> 01:16:06.292
You haven't found out yet?

01:16:06.834 --> 01:16:07.959
It's you!

01:16:08.626 --> 01:16:10.959
These drops make you sleep every night.

01:16:11.417 --> 01:16:14.209
And I get pleasure from you.
So much.

01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:16.542
Almost like before the accident.

01:16:19.126 --> 01:16:20.167
I could report you.

01:16:22.792 --> 01:16:24.042
You'll report me?

01:16:24.917 --> 01:16:25.917
Report me.

01:16:27.834 --> 01:16:29.584
What will you tell the Police?

01:16:29.917 --> 01:16:31.501
What will you tell them?

01:16:32.626 --> 01:16:34.459
That your husband kisses you at night?

01:16:34.626 --> 01:16:35.876
Is that what you'll say?

01:16:35.959 --> 01:16:38.542
That your idiot husband
stays awake at night

01:16:38.626 --> 01:16:40.001
because he desires you?

01:16:40.126 --> 01:16:42.126
That your idiot husband loves you?

01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:44.834
Report me.
Go on, report me.

01:17:28.667 --> 01:17:30.251
Sir, sir.

01:17:30.334 --> 01:17:32.667
Our thing will still go ahead,
won't it?

01:17:32.917 --> 01:17:33.709
Okay.

01:17:41.126 --> 01:17:42.501
<i>- Antonio?
- Where are you?</i>

01:17:42.584 --> 01:17:44.667
<i>I'm going for the test results.</i>

01:17:44.751 --> 01:17:46.959
<i>- To hospital on your own?
- I want to go alone.</i>

01:17:47.042 --> 01:17:49.209
<i>- I would've gone with you.
- No, I'll call you later.</i>

01:17:49.292 --> 01:17:52.209
I'll call you and tell you.
<i>- Call me.</i>

01:17:52.417 --> 01:17:53.834
Yes, I'll call you later.

01:18:27.084 --> 01:18:28.042
Thank you.

01:18:35.459 --> 01:18:36.709
What's she doing?

01:18:38.126 --> 01:18:39.001
What?

01:18:50.501 --> 01:18:53.042
What? The fucking...

01:18:55.084 --> 01:18:55.917
Fuck.

01:19:05.334 --> 01:19:07.167
CALL ME, IF YOU LOVE ME.

01:19:13.209 --> 01:19:15.209
Antonio, what's wrong?
That message?

01:19:15.667 --> 01:19:17.376
Antonio, what's wrong?

01:19:19.501 --> 01:19:20.626
Exactly, what's up?

01:19:21.917 --> 01:19:23.792
- Calm down, Antonio.
- Calm down...

01:19:23.876 --> 01:19:25.042
Calm down.

01:19:25.126 --> 01:19:27.251
I swear I was going for the results.

01:19:27.334 --> 01:19:29.126
I swear on my mother.
- Yeah.

01:19:29.626 --> 01:19:31.417
And they've sent it in a...

01:19:31.959 --> 01:19:33.417
by WhatsApp.

01:19:37.876 --> 01:19:38.876
I'm fine.

01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:41.917
I'm okay, I haven't got anything.

01:19:42.001 --> 01:19:44.126
The biopsy was fine,
everything was fine.

01:19:44.209 --> 01:19:45.542
I'm clear Antonio.

01:19:51.417 --> 01:19:52.334
Show me.

01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:54.667
What?

01:19:55.167 --> 01:19:57.126
The WhatsApp.
I want to see it.

01:20:05.959 --> 01:20:07.917
Candela!
Candela!

01:20:15.834 --> 01:20:16.876
Hello.

01:20:18.626 --> 01:20:20.792
María Candelaria Rodríguez Costa.

01:20:21.251 --> 01:20:23.792
- That's me.
- Are you her husband?

01:20:25.084 --> 01:20:28.876
Well, it looks as though
you are responsible for her fainting.

01:20:29.126 --> 01:20:31.334
- Me?
- She's pregnant.

01:20:31.584 --> 01:20:32.292
What?

01:20:33.417 --> 01:20:34.626
Congratulations.

01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:42.167
- Excuse me, room 203?
- Yes, over there.

01:20:42.251 --> 01:20:44.876
The second on the left.
- Thank you.

01:20:49.292 --> 01:20:50.501
Alejandro.

01:20:51.084 --> 01:20:52.251
Alex.

01:20:59.542 --> 01:21:00.792
What happened?

01:21:02.292 --> 01:21:03.376
Last night,

01:21:03.834 --> 01:21:07.709
when we went to the car park,
we were robbed and you bumped your head.

01:21:08.459 --> 01:21:11.334
But there's nothing wrong,
everything is okay.

01:21:11.417 --> 01:21:13.334
There is something wrong, Nata.

01:21:15.626 --> 01:21:17.251
I prepared it all.

01:21:18.251 --> 01:21:19.501
Yes, I know.

01:21:21.167 --> 01:21:22.251
Fuck.

01:21:23.834 --> 01:21:26.001
We'd practised it loads of times.

01:21:26.084 --> 01:21:29.209
What's more,
they were good actors from drama school.

01:21:29.292 --> 01:21:31.626
I think I overacted, Natalia.

01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:34.959
They were meant to hit me
with a fake bottle.

01:21:35.042 --> 01:21:37.626
I don't know what happened,
because my nose...

01:21:37.709 --> 01:21:40.584
That doesn't matter,
I have to tell you something.

01:21:41.376 --> 01:21:42.459
What?

01:21:42.542 --> 01:21:45.084
I have to tell you something
and I don't know how,

01:21:45.167 --> 01:21:48.126
because it's embarrassing,
but I have to tell you.

01:21:48.251 --> 01:21:49.834
Natalia, don't scare me.

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:56.876
What happened to me
at the petrol station has a name.

01:21:56.959 --> 01:21:58.834
It's called harpaxophilia.

01:21:58.917 --> 01:22:01.334
I know it's that because in my family

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:05.667
there are a series of sexual paraphiles
which are repeated in the females.

01:22:05.876 --> 01:22:08.417
For example,
my grandmother liked cripples.

01:22:08.501 --> 01:22:10.501
Do you remember my lame grandad?

01:22:10.584 --> 01:22:11.459
Yes.

01:22:12.126 --> 01:22:14.334
Or my sister, who has dendrophilia.

01:22:14.417 --> 01:22:17.459
- Are you serious?
- I get it a bit in summer.

01:22:21.251 --> 01:22:24.542
- What is it?
- Well...

01:22:26.001 --> 01:22:28.876
you get aroused by plants.

01:22:29.584 --> 01:22:32.376
- Oh, my word!
- By all kinds of plants.

01:22:34.542 --> 01:22:37.042
Forgive me, please.
I'm so sorry.

01:22:37.126 --> 01:22:41.501
I should have told you before,
but I didn't know how to.

01:22:41.626 --> 01:22:44.001
Now look...
- Okay, Nata, don't worry.

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:46.334
Nata, don't worry.
It's fine.

01:22:46.751 --> 01:22:48.834
Okay?
- I'm sorry.

01:22:51.001 --> 01:22:54.959
What concerns me,
last night, in the car park...

01:22:56.251 --> 01:22:58.417
Did you like it?
- Yes.

01:23:01.459 --> 01:23:02.667
But, did you come?

01:23:05.709 --> 01:23:06.626
Yes.

01:23:08.001 --> 01:23:10.167
A lot.
- That's it then, Natalia.

01:23:10.667 --> 01:23:13.126
That's it.
Pass me my rucksack.

01:23:14.542 --> 01:23:15.626
- The rucksack.
- Okay.

01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:17.251
I've got something here.

01:23:17.584 --> 01:23:19.584
No more surprises, please.

01:23:22.167 --> 01:23:26.167
Natalia Figueroa y Dos Sicilias,
will you marry me,

01:23:26.751 --> 01:23:30.417
fuck with flowers,
come in car parks,

01:23:31.751 --> 01:23:36.667
and fart with me the rest of your life
till your grandmother do us part?

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:44.792
Yes, yes!

01:23:46.334 --> 01:23:47.292
Here.

01:23:57.876 --> 01:23:59.167
Sorry, sorry.

01:24:07.251 --> 01:24:08.917
I'm going to have a fig.

01:24:22.876 --> 01:24:23.917
I'm full.

01:24:30.084 --> 01:24:31.834
I'm so tired.

01:24:33.876 --> 01:24:35.542
I'm going to lie down for a while,

01:24:35.626 --> 01:24:38.167
I'm working tonight
and I feel a wreck.

01:24:38.334 --> 01:24:39.209
Okay.

01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:42.917
I'm going to...

01:24:44.084 --> 01:24:46.584
I'll be with Rafa all afternoon,
I'll see you later.

01:24:47.334 --> 01:24:49.084
Have a lie down if you want.

01:25:00.334 --> 01:25:01.626
I'm going!

01:26:50.001 --> 01:26:51.251
POLYAMORY

01:26:51.334 --> 01:26:54.251
STABLE INTIMATE/SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN THREE OR MORE PEOPLE

01:26:57.376 --> 01:27:00.709
Hi, good afternoon,
my name's Sandra.

01:27:00.959 --> 01:27:03.501
Tell me the number
you would like to contact with.

01:27:09.167 --> 01:27:12.292
Welcome to Hot Bitches.
Is this the first time you've called?

01:27:14.001 --> 01:27:15.001
Seriously?

01:27:15.126 --> 01:27:16.376
Sorry, are you there?

01:27:16.959 --> 01:27:19.417
- Hello, good afternoon.
- Hello, good afternoon.

01:27:19.501 --> 01:27:22.167
I'm calling from a centre...

01:27:23.417 --> 01:27:25.709
offering video interpreting calls
for deaf people.

01:27:25.834 --> 01:27:28.334
Fine, what kind of girl
do you want to talk to?

01:27:29.501 --> 01:27:30.709
Who do you want to talk to?

01:27:31.042 --> 01:27:32.167
What are the options?

01:27:33.542 --> 01:27:34.501
What are the options?

01:27:34.626 --> 01:27:36.459
University students,
big boobs, transexuals,

01:27:36.542 --> 01:27:41.084
<i>lesbians, Asians, dwarfs,
droopy fanny, vaginoplasty, classic sadism,</i>

01:27:41.167 --> 01:27:43.834
<i>and more contemporary
sadism if you like.</i>

01:27:43.959 --> 01:27:48.584
Witch from the Middle Ages
on a cross with five men torturing her?

01:27:49.667 --> 01:27:51.834
Heterosexual blondes only.

01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:55.917
Well, blondes then.

01:27:56.001 --> 01:27:57.292
With blondes, please.

01:27:57.376 --> 01:27:59.876
Hold the line,
I'll put you through.

01:28:01.251 --> 01:28:04.834
Hello, I'm Full of Life,
but you can call me Full.

01:28:04.917 --> 01:28:06.584
Yes, good afternoon, Full.

01:28:06.751 --> 01:28:09.251
- Oh, you're a girl.
- Yes.

01:28:09.334 --> 01:28:11.792
It's my first time with a girl.

01:28:12.292 --> 01:28:15.501
What do you want me to do?
- No, it isn't for me.

01:28:15.584 --> 01:28:19.542
I'm making
a video call with a deaf person

01:28:19.626 --> 01:28:22.209
and he's asked me
to translate it into sign language.

01:28:22.334 --> 01:28:24.167
- Deaf?
- Yes.

01:28:24.667 --> 01:28:27.626
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

01:28:27.834 --> 01:28:32.126
So, I talk to you,
and you translate in sign language?

01:28:32.209 --> 01:28:33.126
Exactly.

01:28:33.209 --> 01:28:34.542
What is she saying?

01:28:34.667 --> 01:28:37.209
<i>I can say some words in sign language.</i>

01:28:37.376 --> 01:28:40.709
I can say "cunt face".
<i>- Yes.</i>

01:28:40.792 --> 01:28:41.584
And ham.

01:28:41.792 --> 01:28:43.792
- Good.
<i>- But you can't see me.</i>

01:28:45.917 --> 01:28:48.001
Hey, what's the lad like?
Is he handsome?

01:28:49.209 --> 01:28:50.626
Yes, yes, he's...

01:28:51.751 --> 01:28:54.626
<i>- He's cute.
- Ask him if it's hard.</i>

01:28:54.751 --> 01:28:56.417
- What?
- If he's got a hard on.

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:03.584
Have you got a hard on?

01:29:05.792 --> 01:29:07.084
Say yes.

01:29:08.042 --> 01:29:09.417
He has, he has.

01:29:10.209 --> 01:29:13.501
Tell him I'm going to put
his enormous hard shaft

01:29:13.584 --> 01:29:15.834
in my pursed lips.
- Fine.

01:29:16.209 --> 01:29:20.251
<i>Tell him I've got lips from the '20s,
like a silent-movie actress.</i>

01:29:20.584 --> 01:29:21.751
<i>Tell him.</i>

01:29:24.792 --> 01:29:27.876
Tell her
to spit on my dick and lick it.

01:29:28.334 --> 01:29:29.834
No, no, no.

01:29:31.084 --> 01:29:34.792
Please, I'm a poor, lonely deaf boy.

01:29:38.667 --> 01:29:40.542
You're very cheeky.

01:29:43.709 --> 01:29:46.251
- Hello?
- Yes, I'm still here. Tell me.

01:29:46.376 --> 01:29:49.334
Yes, I'll explain, he wants you...

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:50.917
to lick his penis.

01:29:51.001 --> 01:29:53.959
Of course I'll lick his penis,
I'll put it in my mouth.

01:29:54.917 --> 01:29:56.501
<i>And I'll tongue it.</i>

01:29:56.917 --> 01:30:00.709
Is his pink
or more of a depigmented tan?

01:30:01.084 --> 01:30:02.751
<i>Because I like them all.</i>

01:30:05.042 --> 01:30:07.251
My cunt lips are throbbing.

01:30:07.417 --> 01:30:10.917
<i>They're burning.
Oh, it's so hot.</i>

01:30:11.626 --> 01:30:13.167
<i>It's so hot.</i>

01:30:14.126 --> 01:30:15.709
<i>So hot.</i>

01:30:16.167 --> 01:30:17.959
<i>It's so hot.</i>

01:30:18.876 --> 01:30:21.876
Shit!
Keep him occupied a minute.

01:30:22.001 --> 01:30:23.667
- Please, don't hang up.
<i>- Why?</i>

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:24.959
For fuck's sake...

01:30:27.376 --> 01:30:29.959
Tell her I want to shag her hard.

01:30:31.584 --> 01:30:33.126
No, no...

01:30:33.334 --> 01:30:38.292
She says...
She prefers it softly first

01:30:38.459 --> 01:30:40.876
and harder after.

01:30:41.209 --> 01:30:43.626
Ask her if she wants me
to put it up her ass.

01:30:45.334 --> 01:30:50.292
She prefers to snuggle up now,
and cuddle...

01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:53.126
How do you know?

01:30:53.501 --> 01:30:55.042
You haven't even asked her.

01:30:57.501 --> 01:30:58.792
Go on, ask her.

01:31:01.959 --> 01:31:05.126
"I want to put it up your ass."

01:31:06.959 --> 01:31:09.209
- Sorry, are you still there?
<i>- Yes, of course.</i>

01:31:09.292 --> 01:31:12.751
Sorry, I've had
a domestic accident in my house.

01:31:14.459 --> 01:31:16.251
Does he want me to carry on sucking it?

01:31:17.334 --> 01:31:20.042
I don't think so,
he's putting it up your ass.

01:31:20.126 --> 01:31:22.376
I don't care, woman,
ask him.

01:31:22.876 --> 01:31:23.751
Fine.

01:31:24.501 --> 01:31:27.959
Do you want me to suck it?

01:31:28.834 --> 01:31:32.584
After putting it up her ass
she wants to suck it?

01:31:36.251 --> 01:31:37.417
Giggles, right?

01:31:37.709 --> 01:31:38.876
<i>You playing a joke?</i>

01:31:40.834 --> 01:31:42.751
<i>You think it's funny, do you?</i>

01:31:43.292 --> 01:31:46.417
You're one big son of a bitch.
I believed the bit about the deaf lad

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:48.542
and my kitchen
went up in flames, bitch.

01:31:48.626 --> 01:31:51.126
Fuck your bloody mother
and that deaf lad's too.

01:31:51.209 --> 01:31:52.334
Son of a bitch!

01:31:52.417 --> 01:31:55.584
Drop dead, bitch!
I'll slit your throat to your cunt!

01:31:57.417 --> 01:31:58.292
What the...

01:32:00.209 --> 01:32:01.709
She hung up.

01:32:06.542 --> 01:32:07.876
Sorry for bothering you.

01:32:08.251 --> 01:32:10.084
No worries, it's been...

01:32:10.167 --> 01:32:11.667
very interesting.

01:32:11.917 --> 01:32:13.084
Interesting.

01:32:14.459 --> 01:32:16.084
Need anything else?

01:32:19.209 --> 01:32:20.251
Any more work?

01:32:20.501 --> 01:32:21.542
Not for the minute.

01:32:23.251 --> 01:32:25.626
Don't hang up then, please.

01:32:33.459 --> 01:32:34.376
What are you doing?

01:32:38.417 --> 01:32:40.501
Studying for Civil Service exams.

01:32:41.001 --> 01:32:41.959
Go for it.

01:32:46.209 --> 01:32:47.959
Aren't you going out today?

01:32:48.876 --> 01:32:52.376
Maybe, it's the local festivals.

01:32:53.001 --> 01:32:55.459
It's hard to sleep with the noise.

01:32:55.917 --> 01:32:57.542
I live in the area.

01:32:58.001 --> 01:32:58.834
I know.

01:33:00.917 --> 01:33:02.501
How do you know?

01:33:04.376 --> 01:33:05.751
I've seen you round there.

01:33:06.167 --> 01:33:07.501
I've never seen you.

01:33:07.876 --> 01:33:08.917
I've seen you...

01:33:09.626 --> 01:33:10.626
a lot.

01:33:18.459 --> 01:33:20.417
Sorry, I have to go.

01:33:23.292 --> 01:33:24.876
Good luck with the exam.

01:33:25.209 --> 01:33:27.417
If I pass it will be thanks to you.

01:34:02.084 --> 01:34:03.001
<i>Three.</i>

01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:04.709
<i>Three.</i>

01:34:05.501 --> 01:34:08.292
Only with three numbers
we give out the tablet.

01:34:11.792 --> 01:34:14.417
Come on, ladies, gentlemen,
we're giving them away!

01:34:14.501 --> 01:34:15.876
We're giving them away!

01:34:15.959 --> 01:34:18.292
I'm going to be a father.
So there, man.

01:34:18.542 --> 01:34:20.834
Antonio!
The dog, Blanki!

01:34:21.292 --> 01:34:22.251
Antonio!

01:34:22.334 --> 01:34:26.334
I've told her you're both my partner
but she doesn't understand.

01:34:27.042 --> 01:34:29.167
How can she understand it?

01:34:31.042 --> 01:34:33.042
- Melting pot.
- So many.

01:34:33.126 --> 01:34:35.167
Yes, yes.
Look, candy floss.

01:34:35.251 --> 01:34:36.626
- And apples.
- Yes.

01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:39.167
- Carnations.
- Do you want some, darling?

01:34:39.251 --> 01:34:42.709
I found my sister getting off
with a calabash when I was 15.

01:34:42.792 --> 01:34:44.084
- No!
- Yes.

01:34:44.167 --> 01:34:46.876
Come on, come on.
Up you come.

01:34:47.251 --> 01:34:50.834
Up you come.
Come on, that's it.

01:34:51.292 --> 01:34:52.542
A drum!

01:34:53.751 --> 01:34:55.417
What?
What do you want?

01:42:05.001 --> 01:42:10.209
