WEBVTT

02:06.709 --> 02:08.211
Hey, it's morning.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.463
Wake up, boys.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.925
Praetorian…

02:25.270 --> 02:28.690
Hold on, folks!
Can we zoom in with that shot?

02:29.983 --> 02:32.318
I knew it! It's him!

02:32.402 --> 02:36.906
Who is the superhero who's come to
San Francisco where a string of assaults

02:36.990 --> 02:38.324
on jewelry stores has occurred?

02:38.408 --> 02:43.413
It's the enforcer of ancient Rome
revived in the present day, Praetorian!

02:44.038 --> 02:45.874
Of the new generation of superheroes

02:45.957 --> 02:47.876
of The Union of Justice,

02:47.959 --> 02:50.170
Praetorian's popularity is booming
on the West Coast!

02:50.253 --> 02:54.257
Who'd have thought this popular figure
would show up for this level of robberies?

02:54.340 --> 02:55.717
What a surprising development!

02:57.260 --> 03:00.513
The secret of his popularity
is his amazing superpowers!

03:01.180 --> 03:03.224
While he has 200 different abilities,

03:03.308 --> 03:06.936
which one he uses each time
is completely random!

03:07.020 --> 03:08.813
Even Praetorian himself doesn't know!

03:09.397 --> 03:13.693
He's also a popular subject
among oddsmakers overseas.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.905
We can hardly wait to see which

03:17.488 --> 03:19.616
of Praetorian's powers
will manifest today!

03:25.914 --> 03:27.665
What? Which is it?

03:33.129 --> 03:35.214
This is as far as you go.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.469
This ain't fair.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.471
We're truly out of luck now.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.097
Yeah.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.724
Surrender.

03:49.771 --> 03:50.730
-Scatter!
-Right!

03:54.567 --> 03:58.488
Unbelievable! Right off the bat,
it's the incredible Spark Division!

03:59.072 --> 04:01.407
Praetorian himself
divides into multiple copies!

04:01.908 --> 04:03.201
Hold on a second.

04:03.284 --> 04:08.665
This means that if the four Praetorians
each use their powers at random,

04:08.748 --> 04:11.459
the possibilities are
200 to the 4th power!

04:11.542 --> 04:14.087
The possibilities are staggering!

04:14.170 --> 04:15.922
It's all over for these villains!

04:16.005 --> 04:19.384
And most of all,
Praetorian is known for having

04:19.467 --> 04:22.220
absolutely zero mercy on supervillains!

04:42.699 --> 04:44.617
I can take him one-on-one!

05:43.718 --> 05:44.969
Wait--

06:01.819 --> 06:03.029
Beaten to death.

06:14.791 --> 06:15.917
I've got no choice.

06:16.501 --> 06:20.713
May all four of you have bad luck at once!

06:26.511 --> 06:28.137
He's reflecting it back!

06:41.567 --> 06:42.443
Fish?

06:44.904 --> 06:45.947
That hurts!

06:46.030 --> 06:47.323
No way.

07:02.880 --> 07:03.881
Crushed to death.

07:04.465 --> 07:07.927
Incredibly,
he reflected back the bad luck!

07:08.010 --> 07:09.929
That was his Reflection Wave!

07:10.721 --> 07:12.056
Poor guy.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.933
-What's next?
-Yeah!

07:14.725 --> 07:16.269
Nice, Transmit!

07:19.981 --> 07:21.357
Okay! Let's go!

07:25.194 --> 07:27.238
It's Teleport Tension!

07:27.321 --> 07:29.657
We've got an overlap of powers!

07:30.241 --> 07:31.534
I did it before, remember?

07:31.617 --> 07:34.412
You're not the only one
who's good at teleporting!

07:35.997 --> 07:37.039
Yeah.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.224
Kicked to death.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.563
Transmit…

08:17.622 --> 08:19.081
Bring it on!

08:20.541 --> 08:22.543
The last guy's an electrician, huh?

08:22.627 --> 08:23.878
Fuck off!

08:33.971 --> 08:38.851
You ain't taking me
back to prison just yet, bastard!

08:40.937 --> 08:42.772
Don't underestimate electricity!

08:53.533 --> 08:55.201
It's time for your punishment.

08:55.284 --> 08:59.080
Are you kidding me?
Four against one is cowardly!

09:04.502 --> 09:06.420
It's just the two of us now, punk.

09:26.857 --> 09:28.693
Hey, you punk villain.

09:29.860 --> 09:30.820
What?

09:31.821 --> 09:33.990
This isn't your first crime, is it?

09:34.073 --> 09:36.367
How long have you
been out of Supermax Prison?

09:36.867 --> 09:39.203
What do you care?

09:40.454 --> 09:41.414
How long has it been?

09:43.249 --> 09:44.458
That's none of your business.

09:55.511 --> 09:56.679
I got out yesterday.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.390
Yesterday? You mean "yesterday" yesterday?

09:59.473 --> 10:01.475
It's really been less than 24 hours?

10:02.393 --> 10:03.603
Yeah…

10:04.645 --> 10:05.980
That's pitiful.

10:06.897 --> 10:08.316
Yeah, it is pitiful.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.194
That's not fair, is it?

10:13.362 --> 10:14.363
All right then.

10:14.447 --> 10:18.326
It's just not fair
to send you back to prison so soon.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.745
Fair? I don't get it.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.915
It really isn't fair, is it, punk villain?

10:25.625 --> 10:29.712
I, Praetorian the enforcer,
am a harsh hero.

10:29.795 --> 10:30.671
However,

10:31.339 --> 10:33.883
I hate the crime, not the criminal.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.428
There's someone in your life
who loves you too, right?

10:38.012 --> 10:40.181
Well… Yeah, there is.

10:44.685 --> 10:47.563
You really shouldn't make
that person sad, should you?

10:49.732 --> 10:51.776
I'll never do anything so stupid again.

10:54.111 --> 10:55.905
Good. That's a promise, right?

10:55.988 --> 10:57.198
Huh?

10:57.990 --> 10:59.950
Yeah, I promise.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.578
You hear that, boys?

11:04.664 --> 11:06.582
You'll never get this chance again!

11:06.666 --> 11:08.834
Yeah… Of course.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.295
I swear on my bad luck.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.296
Yeah.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.466
Make a fresh start in your lives.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.426
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

11:18.302 --> 11:19.720
Farewell, boys!

11:28.646 --> 11:30.689
So long.

11:30.773 --> 11:31.732
What was that about?

11:31.816 --> 11:33.484
-I dunno.
-Yeah.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.782
You half-wits! Get in!

11:39.865 --> 11:40.783
Kasey…

11:41.909 --> 11:42.952
Was that your doing?

11:44.078 --> 11:45.621
Hurry! The cops will be here soon!

12:05.808 --> 12:09.270
Ms. Kasey really is amazing,
ain't she, Frost?

12:09.353 --> 12:13.107
So you can psychically control
anyone you want.

12:13.691 --> 12:18.571
Controlling even Praetorian without him
knowing it is incredible, ain't it?

12:19.155 --> 12:20.072
Yeah!

12:20.156 --> 12:26.245
How come you never told us
Kasey has such an awesome power, Johnny?

12:27.580 --> 12:28.497
Johnny.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.208
Would you shut up, Frost?

12:31.292 --> 12:33.377
She saved you,
so keep quiet and be thankful.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.379
Of course, we are!

12:35.463 --> 12:39.008
We're totally thankful and impressed
by Kasey honey! Right, Transmit?

12:39.091 --> 12:40.134
Yeah!

12:40.718 --> 12:42.970
"Kasey honey"? Watch what you say.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.265
With that kind of power,
we'd be invincible.

12:46.348 --> 12:47.725
Next time, she's coming with--

12:48.309 --> 12:49.143
No thanks!

12:49.226 --> 12:52.688
I was only able to control
that Praetorian out of sheer luck.

12:52.771 --> 12:54.815
That same trick won't work next time.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.609
That's not true.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.819
With your superpower, honey, we can do it.

13:00.237 --> 13:03.741
Every day, he obtains
a different new random power.

13:03.824 --> 13:08.204
Next time, he might have
the power to defend against my ability.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.206
That's what makes Praetorian dangerous.

13:10.789 --> 13:11.707
Kasey…

13:12.583 --> 13:14.960
You guys really are total half-wits.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.588
You're so utterly daft.

13:17.671 --> 13:18.923
You do zero planning.

13:19.006 --> 13:21.884
Everything you do is a complete risk.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.303
What's worse,
your haul wasn't even worth it.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.014
We got 8,000 dollars each!

13:27.097 --> 13:28.224
Yeah!

13:31.227 --> 13:35.147
That's not bad for a night's work.
Right, Johnny?

13:35.231 --> 13:36.065
It sure ain't.

13:36.148 --> 13:41.320
If you guys don't get serious,
you'll end up back in Supermax.

13:41.403 --> 13:42.905
-You're right, honey!
-Right!

14:10.683 --> 14:12.351
What a surprising development!

14:12.434 --> 14:14.728
Praetorian's actions were
so full of affection!

14:14.812 --> 14:16.063
Now that's a real hero!

14:16.146 --> 14:20.025
Praetorian's popularity has been due
to his harsh punishment…

14:20.109 --> 14:23.070
Welcome back, Praetorian! Nice work!

14:24.947 --> 14:28.033
What you did
in San Francisco was so magnificent!

14:28.117 --> 14:29.994
But why did you let them go?

14:31.537 --> 14:32.830
I don't know.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.841
Aw, he's so modest.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.102
I can't take this.

14:55.686 --> 14:56.604
Kasey?

14:56.687 --> 14:59.356
I can't live like this.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.191
I'm sorry.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.735
But those guys are my--

15:02.818 --> 15:03.652
Johnny.

15:04.778 --> 15:05.863
Listen.

15:06.572 --> 15:11.160
If you keep playing at doing crimes
with those half-wit novice villains,

15:11.243 --> 15:13.162
I can't deal with it anymore.

15:13.245 --> 15:16.790
"Playing at doing crimes"?
That's going a little far.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.335
This means I'm through with you.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.337
Wait. What do you mean?

15:21.420 --> 15:24.506
Exactly like it sounds.
I'm done. We're through.

15:25.090 --> 15:28.761
I mean, think about it. You lied to me
and did whatever you pleased.

15:29.386 --> 15:30.971
You broke your promise too.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.183
I'm sorry. But…

15:34.266 --> 15:37.436
Johnny, you need to use your head more.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.146
What?

15:39.730 --> 15:42.024
Just look at the supervillain world.

15:42.107 --> 15:45.069
Don't you see what fate
awaits most of those people?

15:46.779 --> 15:49.782
The little jobs those half-wits do,

15:49.865 --> 15:52.117
the majority of guys
who do that kind of stuff

15:52.201 --> 15:55.704
spend nearly all their lives
inside Supermax. Right?

15:56.956 --> 15:57.790
Yeah.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.875
Use your head!

15:59.959 --> 16:03.963
A real pro supervillain
should pull off a really big job

16:04.046 --> 16:05.673
and retire as soon as possible.

16:06.256 --> 16:09.009
Then by efficiently using
the money you make,

16:09.093 --> 16:12.763
you can live a plain, ordinary,
but extravagant life.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.099
That's not how a villain lives.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.810
It's the same as NBA athletes, right?

16:18.435 --> 16:22.398
After making all they can
during their active career,

16:22.481 --> 16:24.108
they can live an easy life.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.568
Think about it that way.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.113
The NBA?

16:29.947 --> 16:31.198
That's right.

16:31.281 --> 16:35.536
I work as a socially aware server
with those snobbish dilettantes

16:36.036 --> 16:40.582
and study to get my MBA
at night school after work

16:40.666 --> 16:42.876
all just for that moment.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.045
MBA?

16:45.129 --> 16:46.797
Just once is enough.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.049
If we can succeed at one huge haul,

16:49.633 --> 16:51.218
then with my preparation,

16:51.301 --> 16:54.346
I'll manage the investment portfolio
we build with that capital.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.851
All that stuff about
NBA and MBA means nothing to me.

16:59.768 --> 17:00.644
But…

17:00.728 --> 17:02.271
But what?

17:02.354 --> 17:06.525
When is that huge job going to be?
And how will we get it?

17:07.776 --> 17:08.819
Good question.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.530
How long will we have to wait?

17:12.114 --> 17:16.660
And what if our active careers
as villains end before it arrives?

17:16.744 --> 17:18.495
Fine, Johnny.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.914
What? Kasey?

17:22.583 --> 17:23.959
Are you prepared?

17:25.919 --> 17:29.214
You better believe it.
I'm always prepared.

17:29.923 --> 17:31.592
All right then, Johnny.

17:32.384 --> 17:35.596
Do you know who The Heat is?

17:36.305 --> 17:37.431
The Heat?

17:42.770 --> 17:44.438
His name is "The Heat."

17:44.938 --> 17:46.899
In 1970s,

17:46.982 --> 17:50.360
he was a notorious man
who set numerous criminal records.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.741
He would hit jewelry stores
and banks one after another,

17:57.076 --> 17:59.995
steal a car, then make his getaway
over and over again.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.708
A dangerous criminal
who appeared when least expected,

18:05.375 --> 18:08.212
he never once killed anyone
in his 45 years as a villain.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.965
He was considered a hero
by the poor who were under the thumb

18:12.049 --> 18:13.592
of the powerful at that time.

18:14.176 --> 18:18.972
He was a fleeting legend
who swept the land during his prime.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.517
Those who know the true identity

18:22.267 --> 18:25.395
of this legendary supervillain
are already all in the grave.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.774
While tricking the superheroes,

18:28.857 --> 18:33.320
he abruptly disappeared
before anyone could expose him.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.157
But even now,

18:37.241 --> 18:39.743
every time rumors of his death spread,

18:39.827 --> 18:44.456
he has returned again and again
as if to add a new page to his legends.

18:45.165 --> 18:50.295
This living legend is still talked about
throughout the decades.

18:51.004 --> 18:53.799
Just when will he make
his next appearance?

18:55.592 --> 18:57.719
A legendary supervillain, huh?

18:57.803 --> 18:58.637
Yes.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.181
He's my beloved former teacher.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.351
He taught me all I needed
to survive in this industry.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.896
So what happened to The Heat?

19:09.273 --> 19:11.900
What's he got to do with our future?

19:11.984 --> 19:12.901
Everything.

19:13.443 --> 19:14.820
Now for the main event.

19:15.612 --> 19:20.576
The Heat is putting together
a team for a big job

19:20.659 --> 19:22.578
for an overseas client.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.413
An overseas client?

19:24.496 --> 19:25.539
That's right.

19:25.622 --> 19:29.710
If we safely recapture
what was stolen from that client,

19:29.793 --> 19:32.045
we'll get paid 50 million dollars.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.090
After receiving our pay,

19:35.174 --> 19:37.634
it will be split up
among the team members.

19:38.218 --> 19:41.096
Nice. How many people does he need,
and what do we gotta do?

19:41.180 --> 19:44.057
I still haven't been told
about the details.

19:44.141 --> 19:48.187
But luckily, I heard there's
a spot open for one more person.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.608
Sounds good. I like it.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.944
It sure does. I thought you'd like it.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.989
Yeah. But what I like most of all,

19:59.698 --> 20:03.952
Kasey, is I get to do a job with you.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.538
It's not just any job.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.790
It's a colossally enormous job.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.551
I can hardly wait.

20:20.427 --> 20:21.845
I can't either.

20:31.813 --> 20:34.358
So where are we meeting him?

20:35.275 --> 20:36.443
Right here.

20:37.986 --> 20:38.904
What?

20:40.948 --> 20:42.282
The Heat.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.664
Seriously?

22:14.249 --> 22:19.254
