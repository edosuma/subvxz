00:01.914 --> 00:04.139
Did you have something
to do with Vera getting busted?

00:04.140 --> 00:05.379
Who told you to put your business

00:05.380 --> 00:09.221
- anywhere near social media?
- My aspirational little brother.

00:10.119 --> 00:11.677
Someone's gonna get hurt for this.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.414
- What happened to Angela?
- She's not gonna work out for us.

00:14.415 --> 00:15.530
Not on this level.

00:15.565 --> 00:17.352
You didn't have to
stick up for me in there.

00:17.353 --> 00:18.479
Don't do it again.

00:18.480 --> 00:22.204
Evil Corp tapped you for CTO, yes?

00:22.238 --> 00:24.873
- You're ruining your life.
- I also ruined yours.

00:24.907 --> 00:27.709
Terry Colby was involved in the cover up

00:27.743 --> 00:31.028
of the Washington Township
toxic waste scandal.

00:31.080 --> 00:34.816
Sharon, how do you not blow
your brains out, married to him?

00:34.817 --> 00:36.540
I'm in here.

00:38.454 --> 00:40.288
Do you mind sleeping here tonight?

00:40.623 --> 00:42.593
That girl in there is mine.

00:42.594 --> 00:44.759
If you're around tonight,
come over and tell me about it.

00:49.131 --> 00:50.466
Shayla?

00:50.467 --> 00:53.368
Sometimes
the universe aligns perfectly.

00:53.402 --> 00:55.270
Here I am, locked away,

00:55.304 --> 00:57.439
still it brings you right to me.

01:06.916 --> 01:08.650
I feel the sensation.

01:08.684 --> 01:09.885
Fight or flight.

01:09.919 --> 01:12.420
It's constant.

01:12.455 --> 01:14.422
I should just pick one.

01:14.457 --> 01:18.660
I, Elliot Alderson, am flight.

01:18.694 --> 01:19.961
I am fear.

01:19.996 --> 01:23.165
I am anxiety, terror, panic.

01:29.100 --> 01:32.372
- Synced and corrected by skoad -
www.addic7ed.com

01:40.950 --> 01:42.817
Doesn't feel real.

01:47.986 --> 01:52.194
- You should eat.
- Not hungry.

01:52.228 --> 01:54.946
I don't know what I ordered.

01:57.233 --> 01:59.901
I'm sorry.

02:08.836 --> 02:13.235
- You don't like the guisado?
- No, it's good.

02:13.236 --> 02:14.583
Thank you.

02:26.984 --> 02:32.802
- What are you thinking about?
- First time we met.

02:35.037 --> 02:39.541
Doesn't feel that long ago.

02:39.575 --> 02:42.077
Now look at us.

02:42.111 --> 02:45.113
Who would have thought?

02:47.350 --> 02:50.974
- If I could go back and undo this...
- You can't.

02:53.456 --> 02:55.991
You promised me.

02:56.025 --> 02:58.235
I'm gonna get you out of this, okay?

02:58.236 --> 02:59.861
Time's up.

02:59.895 --> 03:01.062
Let's go.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.063
Elliot!

03:03.198 --> 03:04.842
Sit down. Sit down.

03:12.474 --> 03:15.109
Come with me.

03:15.143 --> 03:19.146
Let's go.

03:47.476 --> 03:49.444
- Hello?
- The origin of your name.

03:49.478 --> 03:51.255
I looked it up for you, bruh.

03:51.256 --> 03:54.654
- Where are you taking her?
- Elliot.

03:54.655 --> 03:57.652
"Brave and true."

03:57.687 --> 04:01.718
Did you know the origin of
"brave" evolved from "savage?

04:01.719 --> 04:03.792
I don't know what this is about,

04:03.826 --> 04:05.460
but you need to let her go.

04:05.494 --> 04:06.961
You know, funny thing.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.997
My name means something similar.

04:09.031 --> 04:11.066
Brave traveler.

04:11.100 --> 04:12.300
Adventurer.

04:12.335 --> 04:16.303
Savage traveler becomes brave traveler.

04:16.339 --> 04:20.774
Are we savages, or are we brave?

04:20.810 --> 04:22.110
Don't know, bro.

04:22.144 --> 04:25.814
Listen to me, man.

04:25.848 --> 04:29.584
When I found out you did
this, I didn't get angry.

04:29.618 --> 04:32.454
I got impressed.

04:32.488 --> 04:34.122
Your power.

04:34.156 --> 04:35.690
I want it, Elliot.

04:35.725 --> 04:38.026
And I want it so bad it makes my dick hard.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.528
And I want it today.

04:40.563 --> 04:42.030
I don't know what you think I can do.

04:42.064 --> 04:44.532
I can't just hack you out of prison.

04:44.567 --> 04:47.635
Not all prisons are networked,
and even if yours is,

04:47.670 --> 04:50.171
it would take weeks to find security holes.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.006
Has to be tonight.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.975
I got crosshairs on my heart.

04:54.009 --> 04:55.643
I don't make it out,

04:55.678 --> 04:58.880
I'm dead, and that ain't
meant to be just yet.

04:58.914 --> 05:00.648
You do your thing, bro.

05:00.683 --> 05:03.017
You're asking the impossible.

05:03.052 --> 05:07.856
When we cross paths tonight,
Elliot, I'ma hug you.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.891
Please listen, man.

05:09.925 --> 05:12.994
Shayla... this is on me.

05:12.995 --> 05:13.661
Okay?

05:13.696 --> 05:15.530
You got to let her go.

05:15.564 --> 05:16.831
Oh, that?

05:16.866 --> 05:18.466
She cool, bro.

05:18.501 --> 05:20.301
Trust me, she cool.

05:20.336 --> 05:22.337
She'll be there tonight too.

05:22.371 --> 05:24.546
It'll be one big happy happy.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.044
Hey, Elliot.

05:30.079 --> 05:31.913
I love you, bro.

05:52.712 --> 05:55.157
- Where's Shayla?
- Man, I'm not gonna tell you again.

05:55.158 --> 05:58.239
Stop asking so many questions.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.275
Come on.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.581
Vera
may be out of his mind,

06:06.615 --> 06:10.218
but yes, it is possible to
hack into a prison's network.

06:10.252 --> 06:14.189
Most of them use regular
industrial control systems.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.596
I'm a blind man to what
Vera sees in this dude.

06:19.597 --> 06:23.198
Amen. Techie computer hacker
genius, my thick Dominican dick.

06:25.601 --> 06:27.535
When
you have control of that,

06:27.570 --> 06:29.137
you basically have
control of the cell doors.

06:32.608 --> 06:35.477
But what these morons don't know is,

06:35.511 --> 06:38.980
it's almost impossible
without any research.

06:39.014 --> 06:42.383
Time to shine your cojones and get to work.

06:42.418 --> 06:45.820
do what we say.

06:45.855 --> 06:49.457
You violate that dictate,
we kill your sweetheart.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.892
Yo, Isaac.

06:51.199 --> 06:54.738
- How my dic-Tate?
- Shut up, bitch.

06:55.698 --> 06:57.499
Dictate.

07:03.672 --> 07:06.007
Vera's bro, Isaac.

07:06.041 --> 07:08.176
Something about him bugs me,

07:08.210 --> 07:11.179
and you know what I like
to do when that happens?

07:23.025 --> 07:24.420
_

07:26.804 --> 07:30.091
_

07:36.072 --> 07:38.048
_

07:47.683 --> 07:52.120
Hi, I'm trying to reach Mr. Beckett.

07:52.154 --> 07:54.188
When would Mr. Lattimer be available?

07:54.223 --> 07:55.790
I can come in today.

07:55.824 --> 07:59.060
I already told you what
it's in reference to.

07:59.094 --> 08:02.130
I'm trying again for Mrs. Nayar.

08:02.164 --> 08:04.732
Regarding the Washington Township scandal.

08:04.767 --> 08:06.634
I may have found some information.

08:06.669 --> 08:09.237
Please don't put me on hold again.

08:23.285 --> 08:26.353
Happy Monday, Angela.

08:26.388 --> 08:28.856
How fun.

08:30.183 --> 08:33.193
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

09:13.068 --> 09:15.803
I'm Emily Moss's daughter.

09:15.838 --> 09:17.339
Angela Moss.

09:17.340 --> 09:19.474
- I called...
- Six times.

09:19.508 --> 09:21.042
Yes.

09:21.076 --> 09:25.079
I'm here to discuss the
Washington Township case.

09:27.449 --> 09:30.752
I'm listening.

09:30.786 --> 09:32.720
You represented the victim's families.

09:32.755 --> 09:35.156
26 families, mine included.

09:35.190 --> 09:37.558
I thought with the latest
news in the data dumps...

09:37.593 --> 09:39.260
the Terry Colby scandal,

09:39.294 --> 09:41.129
his covering up the chemical waste spill.

09:41.163 --> 09:42.930
Alleged.

09:42.965 --> 09:46.934
- Well, and documents.
- Superficial.

09:46.969 --> 09:51.172
But if we bring this
stronger, more concrete case...

09:51.206 --> 09:54.142
you'll see that I have the
evidence from the data dumps.

09:54.176 --> 09:57.445
- Along with further research.
- Stickies.

09:57.479 --> 10:00.181
Oh, and you've highlighted and underlined.

10:00.215 --> 10:03.217
This is serious.

10:05.688 --> 10:09.824
So, you want to take Internet
gossip to federal court

10:09.858 --> 10:12.193
and throw it at the strongest conglomerate

10:12.227 --> 10:14.362
in the history of civilization?

10:26.875 --> 10:29.510
Guy in the suit.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.779
Twice convicted of sexual assault,

10:31.814 --> 10:33.815
charged again this past weekend.

10:33.849 --> 10:35.450
Raped his pregnant girlfriend.

10:35.484 --> 10:37.485
Bashed her head in with an Xbox.

10:37.519 --> 10:40.188
Claims she cheated during Halo.

10:40.222 --> 10:43.224
Yet I have a better
chance of defending him.

10:56.004 --> 10:58.706
You called back.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.742
I called every lawyer from this case,

11:00.776 --> 11:03.778
and you're the only
one that called me back.

11:39.914 --> 11:41.110
_

11:42.548 --> 11:46.800
_

12:00.487 --> 12:04.158
Shit. Shit, shit.

12:08.463 --> 12:10.164
Connection
closed by remote host.

12:10.198 --> 12:13.400
But we had a fish. I was in.

12:13.435 --> 12:17.071
The exploit started to run,
and then... was it the code?

12:17.105 --> 12:19.740
Brah, what's the deal?

12:26.014 --> 12:27.681
I got to take her for a walk.

12:27.716 --> 12:29.516
Why?

12:29.551 --> 12:31.013
'Cause she'll piss on the floor if I don't.

12:31.014 --> 12:34.288
You think I've a shit
about your goddamn floor?

12:41.696 --> 12:43.497
I'm just playing, brah.

12:43.531 --> 12:48.102
Yeah, you can take her.

12:48.136 --> 12:49.536
You hear what I said?

12:49.571 --> 12:53.006
I said you can take her.

13:01.816 --> 13:04.218
Come on.

13:14.896 --> 13:19.366
- It's out.
- Okay, got you.

13:39.187 --> 13:42.222
Did she like my little toy?

13:42.257 --> 13:46.727
- Did you write that exploit yourself?
- I had an hour.

13:46.761 --> 13:49.363
So what, you just pulled code
from rapid nine or some shit?

13:49.397 --> 13:52.199
Since when did you become a script kiddie?

13:52.233 --> 13:55.068
I repeat, I had an hour.

13:55.103 --> 13:57.905
Malware detection must have caught it.

13:57.939 --> 14:01.008
- You fucked me.
- Hey, don't put this on me, okay?

14:01.042 --> 14:02.409
Th is a shit show

14:02.444 --> 14:04.378
and you gave me no time to do it right.

14:04.412 --> 14:07.381
I can run circles around an
ICS given the proper whitepapers

14:07.415 --> 14:10.184
and time.

14:10.218 --> 14:13.169
- Where the hell are you going?
- I have no problem telling

14:13.170 --> 14:15.184
these two douchetools they're
gonna have to sit on their pricks

14:15.185 --> 14:16.924
till we can find a better solution.

14:16.958 --> 14:19.388
- You don't understand. These guys are...
- Assholes?

14:19.389 --> 14:22.429
Yeah, I'm gonna tell them what's up.

14:24.933 --> 14:26.366
That's what's up, girl.

14:26.401 --> 14:27.434
Hmm?

14:27.469 --> 14:29.236
Now, let's go.

14:39.614 --> 14:43.050
So none of those guys called
you back, not even Lattimer?

14:43.084 --> 14:44.785
Pussies.

14:44.819 --> 14:46.587
I bet they didn't even
bother to read the data dumps.

14:46.621 --> 14:49.156
But you read them.

14:49.190 --> 14:51.058
You know it took me eight years

14:51.092 --> 14:54.728
to rebuild my career after
our case was dismissed?

14:54.762 --> 15:00.300
So, as much as I think is
company is evil incarnate...

15:00.335 --> 15:02.603
and trust me, they are...

15:02.637 --> 15:04.938
You know, it's not worth it.

15:09.544 --> 15:12.112
What would it take,

15:12.146 --> 15:15.048
hypothetically...

15:15.050 --> 15:20.153
- What do we need to prove our case?
- Hypothetically, a reliable eye witness...

15:20.155 --> 15:23.209
You know, if you miraculously
find someone on the inside to flip.

15:23.658 --> 15:25.573
Someone who was there

15:25.574 --> 15:30.664
when the decision was may to
falsify chemical waste and tells...

15:30.698 --> 15:32.050
So,

15:32.051 --> 15:36.503
unless you're Facebook friends
with one of those assholes,

15:36.538 --> 15:40.073
this hypothetical is just that.

15:42.377 --> 15:44.278
Let's move on.

15:44.312 --> 15:47.014
Where are you working these?

15:47.048 --> 15:48.682
You have a boyfriend?

15:48.716 --> 15:51.552
How's your dad?

15:51.586 --> 15:55.055
I work for a company
that doesn't respect me,

15:55.089 --> 15:57.824
my boyfriend recently cheated on me,

15:57.859 --> 16:02.262
and my father is drowning in debt.

16:09.050 --> 16:11.952
- I'll see you next time.
- Okay.

16:18.025 --> 16:21.227
Fluorescent lights are hell, no?

16:23.230 --> 16:25.064
Was there a change in schedule?

16:25.099 --> 16:28.034
I thought I had Spencer next.

16:28.068 --> 16:32.022
These interviews, they're
just a waste of your time.

16:32.023 --> 16:35.875
I mean, you know our regulatory
and IP issues inside out.

16:35.910 --> 16:38.302
I was thinking we play
hooky the rest of the day,

16:38.303 --> 16:42.822
hit the back nine.

16:43.869 --> 16:47.974
- Is that a Vacheron?
- Patek Philippe Tourbillon.

16:47.975 --> 16:52.158
A gift from the Prince of, uh...

16:55.129 --> 17:00.459
Oh, does it even matter?

17:03.103 --> 17:06.606
But I'm not blowing off
my remaining interviews.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.407
Look.

17:09.742 --> 17:13.746
I know you think you
were a shoo-in for CTO,

17:13.747 --> 17:16.549
and you're pissed.

17:16.583 --> 17:20.752
Probably wishing I'd fall
into the subway tracks.

17:20.788 --> 17:25.458
So how about you cut the bullshit?

17:25.492 --> 17:28.594
I'm afraid your paranoia has
gotten the best of you, but,

17:28.629 --> 17:30.653
nevertheless, please excuse me.

17:30.654 --> 17:32.065
I'll leave you to review your notes

17:32.066 --> 17:33.553
before Spencer arrives.

17:33.554 --> 17:37.938
Oh, and thank you for dinner.

17:37.972 --> 17:39.306
The entire evening was enchanting.

17:39.340 --> 17:43.048
The food, the wine, the lovely Sharon.

17:44.378 --> 17:49.206
Please tell her I say hello.

17:49.772 --> 17:52.006
Did you enjoy the view?

17:56.211 --> 17:58.719
What?

17:58.720 --> 18:05.549
- Do you think she wouldn't tell me?
- I'm not sure what you're trying...

18:05.550 --> 18:07.722
You want to watch me piss too?

18:07.756 --> 18:10.713
- I've had several glasses of water.
- Scott, a misunderstand...

18:10.714 --> 18:14.028
Happy to pull my dick out
for you, if that's your thing.

18:14.063 --> 18:16.325
Watching the Knowles family urinate.

18:16.326 --> 18:21.235
Hell, I could fly my brother in from Miami.

18:21.270 --> 18:23.738
He has the bladder of a small child.

18:23.772 --> 18:26.184
You'd probably bust a nut
watching him take a leak.

18:26.653 --> 18:29.276
I'm not sure what she told
you, but if I were you,

18:29.277 --> 18:31.512
I would tell her to find
more appropriate ways

18:31.547 --> 18:34.716
of managing her imagination.

18:34.750 --> 18:36.517
Tyrell.

18:36.552 --> 18:38.086
I want you to accept a hard truth,

18:38.120 --> 18:41.923
right here, right now, in front of me.

18:41.957 --> 18:45.960
You are not going to be CTO.

18:48.364 --> 18:52.600
I want to see that look
wash over your face.

18:52.634 --> 18:56.437
It's the only way I know
you'll stop playing these

18:56.472 --> 19:00.648
silly, silly games.

19:00.649 --> 19:05.046
Oh, I am fully aware you're CTO, Scott.

19:05.080 --> 19:10.084
I'm not sure what more I can offer you.

19:10.119 --> 19:12.754
Wait.

19:12.788 --> 19:15.189
Here.

19:16.925 --> 19:18.292
I feel bad.

19:18.327 --> 19:20.628
After all, you got a child on the way.

19:20.662 --> 19:21.829
You need all the help you can get.

19:21.864 --> 19:23.331
In fact,

19:23.332 --> 19:26.968
this would probably pay off
the rest of your mortgage.

19:27.002 --> 19:32.006
Aren't you still in that neat
little two bedroom in Chelsea?

19:35.177 --> 19:37.612
There.

19:40.482 --> 19:43.484
That's the look I was looking for.

19:52.595 --> 19:57.565
I keep brute force
thinking, but it's not working.

19:57.600 --> 19:58.967
I need help.

20:12.781 --> 20:16.251
- Elliot, you in there?
- Shit.

20:16.285 --> 20:17.852
Why is she here?

20:19.455 --> 20:20.588
Elliot!

20:23.192 --> 20:25.162
Let me in.

20:27.196 --> 20:31.099
Elliot, you in there?

20:31.133 --> 20:32.834
Little blonde bitty.

20:32.868 --> 20:35.642
Elliot, hit the buzzer.

20:37.678 --> 20:38.812
I know you're in there.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.347
Go.

20:40.381 --> 20:42.382
Shut her up, and get
her the hell out of here.

20:42.416 --> 20:45.652
Elliot. Buzzer. Now.

20:45.686 --> 20:48.586
- What about Darlene?
- She stays with us.

20:48.587 --> 20:50.056
And we'll be watching you,

20:50.091 --> 20:52.859
so don't bother trying any
dumb shit, you dumb shit.

20:57.532 --> 20:59.699
Fuck!

21:11.912 --> 21:15.481
Do you understand why you're angry?

21:15.516 --> 21:19.268
- 'Cause you know I'm right.
-

21:20.550 --> 21:26.536
- _
- _

21:29.229 --> 21:31.843
_

21:38.606 --> 21:41.163
_

21:42.034 --> 21:44.001
_

21:44.340 --> 21:46.733
_

21:47.004 --> 21:48.325
_

21:52.741 --> 21:58.264
_

21:59.247 --> 22:02.668
_

22:02.907 --> 22:05.473
_

22:06.497 --> 22:10.635
- _
- _

22:12.527 --> 22:18.042
- _
- _

22:27.344 --> 22:30.512
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:30.547 --> 22:33.148
I tried looking for you after
Gideon's the other night.

22:33.183 --> 22:38.463
- Where were you?
- I had to think about things, you know?

22:40.357 --> 22:44.727
We always knew what Evil Corp did.

22:44.761 --> 22:47.162
We didn't have the proof,

22:47.197 --> 22:50.666
but we knew.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.401
We were right about it all along.

22:52.435 --> 22:56.004
In fact, that news report
wasn't a confirmation.

22:56.039 --> 23:00.075
It was a reminder of how angry I am.

23:04.447 --> 23:09.051
You remember Nayar, the lawyer on the case?

23:09.085 --> 23:12.654
- I went to her, Elliot.
- Listen, Angela, now's not...

23:12.689 --> 23:17.659
I have an idea that will change the world.

23:17.694 --> 23:19.483
I know it sounds really stupid,

23:19.484 --> 23:23.866
but I know how to do it.

23:25.435 --> 23:30.406
I think it could actually work.

23:30.440 --> 23:33.291
- I can't tell you what it is, because...
- Evil Corp, Angela,

23:33.292 --> 23:35.844
Vera, his brother, Darlene, Shayla.

23:35.879 --> 23:37.613
This is too much.

23:37.647 --> 23:40.516
I should just tell her
what she wants to hear.

23:40.550 --> 23:42.551
Angela,

23:42.585 --> 23:45.521
trust yourself.

23:45.555 --> 23:47.723
You'll do what's right.

23:55.665 --> 23:59.034
That's all I needed.

23:59.068 --> 24:03.560
- How's Shayla, by the way?
- She's...

24:05.618 --> 24:10.636
- you know.
- Tell her I say hi.

24:22.525 --> 24:23.892
have no time to pull off

24:23.927 --> 24:26.354
- whatever it is you think you're doing.
- What are you doing here?

24:26.355 --> 24:27.948
- How did you know?
- Darlene.

24:27.949 --> 24:29.414
These guys aren't playing around.

24:29.415 --> 24:30.417
They will fucking kill you.

24:30.418 --> 24:34.302
- Now wise up, and let's go.
- Darlene's in there. We can't leave.

24:37.140 --> 24:39.408
Okay, then we call the cops.

24:39.442 --> 24:40.576
There's no other choice here.

24:40.610 --> 24:43.278
- It's the only way out of this.
- I can't call the cops.

24:43.313 --> 24:45.494
- Shayla will die.
- Oh, come on.

24:45.495 --> 24:47.583
She knew exactly what she
was getting herself into.

24:47.617 --> 24:49.585
You think his employees
have a long life expectancy?

24:49.619 --> 24:50.953
She was dead the minute

24:50.987 --> 24:54.051
- she started working with that maniac.
- Forget it. It's not happening.

24:54.958 --> 24:56.825
This is a zero-sum game.

24:56.860 --> 24:58.861
Calculate all the outcomes.

24:58.895 --> 25:00.829
If you don't pull off
this ridiculous miracle...

25:00.864 --> 25:03.298
and odds are, you won't...
you die, and so does Shayla.

25:03.333 --> 25:04.500
That much we know.

25:04.534 --> 25:06.034
But assume for a second

25:06.069 --> 25:07.936
that you do pull this off,
bust Vera out of prison.

25:07.971 --> 25:10.606
Who's to say he doesn't
kill you, Shayla, Darlene?

25:10.640 --> 25:12.975
It would be in his own
best interest to do that.

25:13.009 --> 25:15.010
Either way, you all end up dead.

25:15.044 --> 25:17.179
It's the only way Vera wins.

25:17.213 --> 25:18.814
Zero-sum, Elliot.

25:18.848 --> 25:20.449
You're playing a game you already lost.

25:20.483 --> 25:24.853
- You know I'm right.
- There's got to be a way.

25:24.888 --> 25:29.558
- I can think of a way.
- I get it, kiddo.

25:29.592 --> 25:32.394
You want to help people. Watch over 'em.

25:32.428 --> 25:34.897
The best thing you
can do for Shayla...

25:34.931 --> 25:39.813
- allow her to become a memory.
- No.

25:41.905 --> 25:46.375
True courage is about
being honest with yourself.

25:46.409 --> 25:49.344
Especially when it's difficult.

25:49.379 --> 25:55.217
There is no plan where
both you and Shayla survive.

25:55.251 --> 25:57.219
I can think of a way.

25:57.253 --> 26:01.390
This new world that we are so
close to creating will never be.

26:01.424 --> 26:03.058
And that new world, that is success.

26:03.092 --> 26:05.594
Fsociety is success.

26:05.628 --> 26:07.329
Look at what you accomplished
at Steel Mountain.

26:07.363 --> 26:10.032
- That got us nowhere.
- You took them down.

26:10.066 --> 26:12.167
You won that battle.

26:12.201 --> 26:15.604
This... this is failure.

26:15.638 --> 26:17.839
This is the old Elliot.

26:17.874 --> 26:21.276
The one who turns to morphine,
to drugs when he feels weak.

26:21.311 --> 26:23.545
A coward who can't face the truth,

26:23.580 --> 26:28.417
even though it's staring
him right in the face.

26:28.451 --> 26:30.419
There's
that sensation again.

26:30.453 --> 26:32.220
Fight or flight.

26:32.255 --> 26:35.457
Three lives at stake, including my own.

26:35.491 --> 26:40.095
I, Elliot Alderson, am...

26:40.129 --> 26:41.597
what?

26:44.400 --> 26:48.403
Tom Petty, Pink Floyd,
Van Halen? What's up, man?

26:48.438 --> 26:50.872
You ain't got no Drake,
no Pitbull, no nothing?

26:50.907 --> 26:52.774
Like, what's up? What the fuck?

26:56.179 --> 27:00.945
- What's up, Rain Man?
- I'm ready to bust Vera out.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.151
I can get into the network.

27:03.186 --> 27:04.720
We need to go to the jail.

27:04.754 --> 27:07.389
Now.

27:07.423 --> 27:10.158
- She stays here.
- No, I'm not leaving you.

27:10.193 --> 27:11.660
Don't worry,

27:11.694 --> 27:14.846
he's in no position to
be giving out orders.

27:16.633 --> 27:20.168
Let's go, girl.

27:20.203 --> 27:23.805
Remember when the
panic would set in and we had a solution?

27:23.840 --> 27:26.074
To be honest, I miss that.

27:26.109 --> 27:31.013
Life is so much easier when you're numb.

27:31.047 --> 27:37.474
- What's the plan, bitch boy?
- First Shayla, now Darlene.

27:38.521 --> 27:41.594
- Yo, what the fuck?
- Elliot, what are you doing?

27:43.026 --> 27:45.460
Like a hard
drive blasted by excessive voltage,

27:45.495 --> 27:46.528
my mind is frayed.

27:46.562 --> 27:48.597
Close to fried.

27:48.631 --> 27:51.366
I can feel the static
running through my brain.

27:51.401 --> 27:54.002
Serotonin receptors working overtime.

27:54.037 --> 27:55.871
I need more time.

27:59.509 --> 28:04.680
- Tonight, tonight, tonight.
- More time right now.

28:04.714 --> 28:06.648
I'm working on our project as we speak,

28:06.683 --> 28:09.985
so it's in your best interest
to keep talking with me.

28:10.019 --> 28:11.853
At the
security desk, my cell phone

28:11.888 --> 28:14.356
is running an undetectable
activated signal sniffer

28:14.390 --> 28:17.859
that will locate any kind
of wireless signal in sight.

28:17.894 --> 28:20.128
By the time I leave this building,

28:20.163 --> 28:23.131
I'll own its network.

28:23.166 --> 28:25.133
Good on you.

28:25.168 --> 28:30.505
Brave, but stupid.

28:30.540 --> 28:34.576
You showed your face, and
then I skip out tonight.

28:34.610 --> 28:37.679
- Who do you think they're gonna finger?
- I'm opening every cell.

28:37.714 --> 28:39.915
That way, they can't
trace it back to you or me.

28:43.352 --> 28:44.319
Yeah, bro.

28:45.955 --> 28:48.090
That's what I'm talking about.

28:48.124 --> 28:49.191
Whoo!

28:50.359 --> 28:52.327
I told you, didn't I?

28:52.361 --> 28:56.665
- The universe got big plans for us, bro.
- Sit back down.

29:06.576 --> 29:09.044
When you get out, I realize
you're gonna have to split.

29:09.078 --> 29:12.581
You won't be able to stay
in the tri-state area.

29:12.615 --> 29:13.915
Oh, I love this.

29:13.950 --> 29:15.784
Go on.

29:15.818 --> 29:18.787
Wherever you go, you're gonna
need funding to keep surviving.

29:18.821 --> 29:20.388
Which means your whole operation still

29:20.423 --> 29:22.057
needs to be making you money.

29:22.091 --> 29:26.142
- Come on, Elliot. Give it to me.
- I hacked Isaac's phone.

29:28.731 --> 29:32.476
He had everything. Your crew,
shipments, the entire operation.

29:32.477 --> 29:35.704
I took it all. I own your whole world.

29:41.611 --> 29:43.044
I need your word.

29:43.079 --> 29:46.248
When this goes down, Shayla and I go free.

29:46.282 --> 29:47.649
You leave us alone.

29:47.683 --> 29:49.384
Forever.

29:49.418 --> 29:51.153
If anyone tries to hurt us,

29:51.187 --> 29:56.591
if I even see one of your guys
following me, I leak everything.

29:56.626 --> 30:00.044
- You're saying this knowing...
- You can kill me anytime, yes.

30:01.130 --> 30:03.932
That's why I coded the leak
to auto-send every 24 hours

30:03.966 --> 30:06.735
unless I continuously disable it.

30:06.769 --> 30:08.770
No one else has access.

30:08.805 --> 30:11.840
If anything happens to me or Shayla,

30:11.874 --> 30:15.076
your money gets deleted.

30:19.215 --> 30:20.849
Guns up, Vera, let's go.

30:27.690 --> 30:29.991
Remember.

30:30.026 --> 30:32.294
I'ma hug you.

30:57.966 --> 31:03.692
- So what's your deal?
- I'm hear to see Terry Colby.

31:08.376 --> 31:12.346
Who is that, another damn reporter?

31:12.380 --> 31:14.315
No comment. Do you understand?

31:19.054 --> 31:20.888
Do I know you?

31:27.262 --> 31:28.596
Get the hell away from my home.

31:28.630 --> 31:30.598
Get away from my home.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.440
WPA2 Wi-Fi?

31:39.474 --> 31:40.441
Shit.

31:40.475 --> 31:42.276
Borderline unhackable.

31:42.310 --> 31:44.812
Getting that handshake could take days.

31:44.846 --> 31:47.114
The noose is tightening.

32:06.768 --> 32:09.303
The mobile feed on the cameras.

32:09.337 --> 32:13.107
I don't need to hack WPA2
when there's dedicated 4G.

32:16.684 --> 32:19.023
_

32:26.288 --> 32:29.809
- We're good.
- I can pull this off.

32:31.893 --> 32:33.027
- Get in.
- Let's go, girl.

32:33.061 --> 32:36.096
Nah, just him.

32:36.131 --> 32:38.365
- Yo, Isaac, what you doing...
- Nah, bro, it's fine.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.935
I just want to have a
private chat with him.

32:40.969 --> 32:42.703
Come on, it's cool.

32:42.737 --> 32:44.271
We don't have any time, man.

32:44.306 --> 32:48.108
- I got to get to work.
- Get the fucking in the car.

32:55.650 --> 32:57.651
- Yo man, where you going, what you doing?
- All good, all good.

32:57.652 --> 32:58.652
- Just gonna have a talk.
- Are you doing?

33:13.535 --> 33:14.902
Why are you doing this?

33:14.936 --> 33:15.903
I can free your brother.

33:15.937 --> 33:19.073
- I figured it out.
- It just wasn't your day, bruh.

33:19.107 --> 33:20.730
I hacked your whole operation.

33:20.731 --> 33:22.424
- If you kill me...
- You don't get it.

33:22.425 --> 33:26.013
Like I said, it just wasn't your day.

33:28.883 --> 33:30.718
Stop.

33:36.858 --> 33:38.325
I suppose
a bullet through the brain

33:38.360 --> 33:40.427
is peaceful in its own right.

33:47.736 --> 33:52.539
You don't want me to free Vera.

33:52.574 --> 33:54.708
That's why you don't
care about the operation.

33:54.743 --> 33:58.653
- I'd pick better last words.
- You're trying to kill him.

33:58.654 --> 34:01.682
That's why Vera wants to leave tonight.

34:01.716 --> 34:03.917
That's what's been bugging me about you.

34:03.952 --> 34:06.287
You never wanted me to break him out.

34:06.321 --> 34:08.789
Your best option for survival
is to kill him in prison,

34:08.822 --> 34:09.922
because if you don't,

34:09.958 --> 34:12.592
you're dead.

34:12.627 --> 34:14.460
You're the reason Vera's
locked up right now,

34:14.496 --> 34:16.964
and he knows it.

34:16.998 --> 34:18.799
Doesn't matter anyway.

34:18.833 --> 34:23.036
Vera was just gloating about how
he got in with the right crew,

34:23.071 --> 34:26.306
how he got the jump on some men.

34:26.341 --> 34:27.608
He's not worried, man.

34:27.641 --> 34:30.413
- He's protected now.
- Bullshit.

34:30.414 --> 34:32.601
That leaves
you with a zero-sum game.

34:32.601 --> 34:33.925
If you don't get him out of jail,

34:33.926 --> 34:36.016
he'll have you killed for failing.

34:36.050 --> 34:37.717
Only way this works in your favor

34:37.752 --> 34:40.254
is for you to kill him first,

34:40.288 --> 34:42.523
and you can't do that
with him inside anymore.

34:42.556 --> 34:44.024
Shut up, motherfucker.

34:44.058 --> 34:48.446
- Shut the fuckup.
- Let me free him.

34:50.598 --> 34:53.233
When I break Vera out tonight,

34:53.268 --> 34:56.036
you do with your brother what you want.

34:56.070 --> 34:57.504
That's the only outcome

34:57.539 --> 35:01.375
where you got the possibility of living.

35:02.777 --> 35:05.512
It's your best move.

35:05.547 --> 35:08.582
What makes you think I still
won't kill you afterwards?

35:12.654 --> 35:15.355
I don't.

35:15.390 --> 35:17.918
I'm just playing my best move.

35:44.773 --> 35:47.003
I need 30 to 40
seconds with the patrol car's

35:47.004 --> 35:50.812
Bluetooth connection to
run the exploit on the PLC.

35:50.813 --> 35:55.950
- And then?
- The plan executes at 9:49.

35:55.984 --> 35:57.685
All the cell doors should open.

35:59.354 --> 36:02.924
Hey, I wanted to ask you about something.

36:02.958 --> 36:05.593
- Oh, yeah, what's that?
- You.

36:31.420 --> 36:32.820
Give me a call.

36:32.855 --> 36:37.391
- We'll grab a drink, talk, whatever.
- All right.

36:43.765 --> 36:46.767
The exploit's on his laptop.

36:52.374 --> 36:55.343
Now I need to force-feed
it into the jail's network.

36:55.418 --> 37:00.211
_

37:00.212 --> 37:01.983
- (woman) I like what I hear.
- _

37:02.017 --> 37:04.485
- [indistinct radio chatter]
- _

37:07.089 --> 37:10.558
- I paused the exploit.
- Drive.

37:10.592 --> 37:12.860
Darlene's no longer part of the plan.

37:12.895 --> 37:15.897
We got an alarm
going off, east-side exit.

37:18.200 --> 37:21.936
- What in the hell?
- Tell you what.

37:21.970 --> 37:24.071
We go out, we drink, we dance,

37:24.106 --> 37:25.673
see where the night takes us.

37:25.707 --> 37:26.698
You sure you want to make

37:26.699 --> 37:30.002
- that choice right now?
- I only need to press one key

37:30.003 --> 37:33.280
to run the exploit. Or, I can press
another and disable the entire plan.

37:33.281 --> 37:36.317
I made my move.

37:38.954 --> 37:40.555
You make yours.

37:47.396 --> 37:49.063
Shit.

37:49.097 --> 37:50.565
Please move back, miss.

37:50.599 --> 37:53.134
- I got to get back ASAP.
- Whatever.

38:01.176 --> 38:05.680
Look, I got to come back now.
My computer's on the fritz.

38:07.349 --> 38:09.450
Let's go to the meet, DJ.

38:09.484 --> 38:12.420
If I mis-typed
one command, hit one wrong key,

38:12.454 --> 38:14.422
the cell doors won't open.

38:14.456 --> 38:16.824
And we both know what that means.

38:16.858 --> 38:18.826
Did I make a mistake?

38:18.860 --> 38:21.862
No, I don't make mistakes.

38:26.301 --> 38:28.669
One minute till Vera.

38:28.704 --> 38:31.439
For all his insane, inhumane ideas,

38:31.473 --> 38:34.141
he does understand the world.

38:34.176 --> 38:36.911
The wild savagery of the world.

38:43.979 --> 38:46.998
- What you need your piece for, bro?
- Boy Wonder says

38:46.999 --> 38:50.246
he's opening all the cells.
If some fool tries to rush us,

38:51.912 --> 38:53.646
I want to be ready.

39:11.765 --> 39:15.489
- Hey, what the shit?
- Power surge caused by all the cell doors

39:15.490 --> 39:17.003
opening at the same time.

39:17.037 --> 39:20.048
- What about security? Sirens?
- The jail's network will show

39:20.049 --> 39:23.849
all cells locked and closed.
Alarms are silent for two minutes.

40:02.316 --> 40:04.717
Yes. Yes.

40:04.752 --> 40:06.552
This shit right here,

40:06.587 --> 40:10.590
this shit tastes better
than any pussy I ever had.

40:10.624 --> 40:14.594
Whoo!

40:26.507 --> 40:28.374
DJ, shoot the cocksucker.

40:43.190 --> 40:46.292
My own brother.

40:46.327 --> 40:50.029
That's what the universe asked of me.

40:50.064 --> 40:53.199
To be my brother's keeper.

40:53.233 --> 40:55.034
Like Cain after Abel,

40:55.069 --> 40:59.038
I'll be a fugitive and
wanderer on the earth.

40:59.273 --> 41:03.409
Brave fugitive.

41:03.443 --> 41:06.512
Brave wanderer.

41:06.547 --> 41:09.382
Look how you helped me.

41:09.416 --> 41:12.351
That's the kind of bravery
I've been talking about.

41:12.386 --> 41:15.821
But now...

41:15.856 --> 41:19.559
now I want you to look at Isaac.

41:19.593 --> 41:22.094
Look.

41:28.435 --> 41:29.669
Dead proof.

41:29.703 --> 41:31.737
My operation is over.

41:31.772 --> 41:33.439
So go on, crash it.

41:33.473 --> 41:35.107
Burn it to the ground.

41:35.142 --> 41:37.276
Doesn't matter.

41:37.311 --> 41:40.846
I'm gone.

41:40.881 --> 41:42.615
A spirit.

41:42.649 --> 41:45.618
One with all the heavens.

41:45.652 --> 41:47.453
All existence.

41:52.360 --> 41:55.062
Shayla.

41:55.096 --> 42:00.967
- Where is she?
- Keys, yo.

42:01.002 --> 42:04.971
Told you you'd get her back, bro.

42:05.006 --> 42:09.676
You just didn't realize she
was with you the whole time.
