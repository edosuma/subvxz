WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.436
- Ray, you promised.

00:04.438 --> 00:05.637
Come on,

00:05.639 --> 00:07.706
I made lemon chicken
and everything.

00:07.708 --> 00:10.075
- He's not coming home
for dinner?

00:10.077 --> 00:12.778
It might be
the lemon chicken.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.380
- Yeah, she's here.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.647
Yeah, so's your dad.

00:15.649 --> 00:18.017
Pretty much everyone
but you, again.

00:18.019 --> 00:19.184
- I smell lemon chicken.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.754
- It's no good.

00:21.756 --> 00:23.689
- No, I--I understand.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.791
Yeah, okay,
I'll save you some.

00:25.793 --> 00:26.792
Okay, bye.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.460
- It's terrible.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.395
It's just terrible.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.563
- What?

00:31.565 --> 00:33.465
- Raymond doesn't
come home for dinner.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.267
- Marie, ray has
the kind of job

00:35.269 --> 00:37.603
Where he just can't
leave at 5:00.

00:37.605 --> 00:40.072
I mean, you know,
games go into overtime,

00:40.074 --> 00:42.274
And players
have to be interviewed.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.043
Just, lots of things come up
at the last minute.

00:44.045 --> 00:47.613
- Let me ask you this
delicately.

00:47.615 --> 00:50.582
Is it possible he doesn't
want to come home?

00:53.720 --> 00:55.120
- What's the blunt
version of that?

00:55.122 --> 00:58.390
You kick me as you say it?

00:58.392 --> 00:59.758
- Oh, no, I mean,

00:59.760 --> 01:02.327
I just read an article
about this very thing

01:02.329 --> 01:03.662
In "the new york times."

01:03.664 --> 01:05.064
- We get "newsday" every day.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.565
What are you
buying "the times" for?

01:06.567 --> 01:08.333
- I like the obituaries.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.436
They're very well-written.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.071
- You don't even
know those people.

01:12.073 --> 01:15.274
- Well, I feel that I do
after I read about them.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.309
- So you've got
a bunch of new friends,

01:17.311 --> 01:18.444
All dead.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.314
- Frank, marie.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.149
So what did
the article say?

01:24.151 --> 01:26.618
- Well, according
to some new research,

01:26.620 --> 01:29.822
A lot of people stay at work
longer than they have to.

01:29.824 --> 01:31.690
They're happier
at the office.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.725
It's easier.

01:33.727 --> 01:36.628
Yeah, there's friends
and chitchat,

01:36.630 --> 01:37.663
And whereas at home,

01:37.665 --> 01:40.099
There are kids
and mess and--

01:40.101 --> 01:43.402
- Nagging?

01:43.404 --> 01:46.538
- Well, I don't think
that ray would...

01:46.540 --> 01:50.642
- Oh, now I've upset you.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.478
Forget everything I just said.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.179
You know what?

01:54.181 --> 01:55.681
It's probably just
the lemon chicken.

02:01.187 --> 02:03.155
- All right, barone
lines up for the kick

02:03.157 --> 02:05.591
With a look
of determination.

02:05.593 --> 02:09.328
Or is that...Stupidity?

02:09.330 --> 02:10.896
It's a tough kick.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.632
Barone's been battling
a hangnail all season.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.368
- All right, already!

02:16.370 --> 02:19.671
Are you ever off?

02:19.673 --> 02:21.373
Come on,
a little lower, andy.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.274
- It's into the wind...

02:22.276 --> 02:26.145
[blows]

02:26.147 --> 02:29.348
- It's a bit of a drizzle too.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.482
Here it is.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.483
Here's the kick.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.551
It's up.

02:32.553 --> 02:33.552
It's good!

02:33.554 --> 02:35.621
[all cheering]

02:35.623 --> 02:36.755
- He cheated.
- No cheating.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.290
Good!
It's--

02:38.292 --> 02:39.491
Hey!

02:39.493 --> 02:41.460
Hey, my wife's here, everybody.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.262
Hey, my wife.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.430
Hi, what are you--

02:45.432 --> 02:46.598
What are you doing here?

02:46.600 --> 02:47.866
- I brought you dinner.

02:47.868 --> 02:48.901
- What?
Really?

02:48.903 --> 02:49.901
Wow.
Okay.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.570
- Yeah, I thought
you were working.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.273
Thought you
had a column due.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.474
- Yeah.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.177
I do.
I do.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.711
I do.
It's a tough one too.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.647
- Oh, the one
on paper football?

03:01.649 --> 03:02.648
- No, no, no.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.483
I know this looks bad,

03:04.485 --> 03:06.418
But writing doesn't only happen
when you're writing.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.753
Big part of writing
is actually the...

03:07.755 --> 03:08.854
[clicks tongue]
thinking.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.289
Sometimes you're just--

03:10.291 --> 03:11.857
You're thinking and thinking
and thinking,

03:11.859 --> 03:12.857
And you got to just say,

03:12.859 --> 03:14.760
"hey, whoa, just stop
thinking about it

03:14.762 --> 03:16.762
So you can just really

03:16.764 --> 03:20.265
Think about it."

03:20.267 --> 03:22.434
That's what we were doing here
with the paper football thing.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.837
Just letting
the thoughts gel up.

03:25.839 --> 03:26.837
What?
I know, I know.

03:26.839 --> 03:29.608
Look, it sounds crazy,
but that is the writing process.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.745
So now you know.

03:36.416 --> 03:37.716
- Yes, I do.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.585
- What?
Come on, what?

03:39.587 --> 03:41.553
Come on,
we're just working here.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.621
- Pizza in the house!

03:42.623 --> 03:43.989
- All right!

03:43.991 --> 03:44.989
- Oh, pizza?

03:44.991 --> 03:47.326
What,
did somebody have a baby?

03:47.328 --> 03:48.327
- Hey, debra.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.328
- Dave.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.329
- If she's eating,

03:50.331 --> 03:51.697
It's coming out
of your slices.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.465
- I am an idiot.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.766
- You're not.
- Oh, come on.

03:54.768 --> 03:58.537
I've been staying up late
to reheat food for you.

03:58.539 --> 03:59.871
- I know, and I love it.
I love it.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.440
Come on,
is that lemon chicken?

04:01.442 --> 04:02.441
I love it.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.976
- Your mom was right.

04:03.978 --> 04:09.848
- Oh, now,
that's crazy talk.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.783
- She read this article
in "the new york times"

04:11.785 --> 04:12.783
About people like you

04:12.785 --> 04:14.920
Who would rather be at work
than at home.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.788
- I wouldn't
rather be at work.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.924
Believe me, I wish
I wasn't here right now.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.464
- Why not?

04:25.466 --> 04:26.598
I mean, this is a lot more fun

04:26.600 --> 04:28.834
Than cleaning up
and raising kids

04:28.836 --> 04:30.469
And paying the bills.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.571
Boy, I wish I had
someplace to hide out.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.539
- I'm not hiding out.

04:34.541 --> 04:35.941
I'm earning a living,

04:35.943 --> 04:38.977
Which was your idea, I believe.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.747
Look, come on, don't you think
I'd rather be with you guys?

04:41.749 --> 04:43.548
- Hey, if you want pizza,
you'd better get in there.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.284
They're animals!
- Andy.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.052
- All right!

04:47.054 --> 04:49.354
Wheel! Of!
Fortune!

04:49.356 --> 04:50.722
- We're kind of
busy here, andy.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.524
- Oh, that is so easy!
- Andy.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.925
"it ain't over
till the fat lady sings."

04:53.927 --> 04:54.926
I got it in two letters.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.862
Ray usually needs four.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.730
- Yeah, could you
maybe watch that

04:58.732 --> 05:00.365
In the other room, please?

05:01.367 --> 05:02.868
Look, I'm sorry.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.903
- They got
the game highlights on.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.973
They're, like, nuts
in there with the sports.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.975
- So this is working, huh?

05:09.977 --> 05:11.977
- This is
part of work.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.579
- Yeah, you could do this
at home, ray.

05:14.581 --> 05:15.914
- You thinking of working
at home, ray?

05:15.916 --> 05:17.616
- What?
No.

05:17.618 --> 05:20.519
No, andy, that's not what
we're talking about, andy.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.521
I mean, that would be great,
but...

05:22.523 --> 05:23.822
I can't.

05:23.824 --> 05:24.823
- Why not?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.625
- That one guy does.

05:26.627 --> 05:27.826
Oh, my god.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.961
Oh, my god,
they got "fat lad sings."

05:29.963 --> 05:32.597
They still can't get it!

05:32.599 --> 05:35.067
- Who works at home, andy?

05:35.069 --> 05:36.067
- Golden from "the post."

05:36.069 --> 05:38.737
They set him up with a satellite
dish, a fax, and a modem.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.405
He never has
to leave the house.

05:40.407 --> 05:41.606
- Yeah, you ever read his stuff?

05:41.608 --> 05:42.941
It's like he's phoning it in,

05:42.943 --> 05:44.876
'cause, well, he is.

05:47.046 --> 05:48.647
- So you don't want to.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.749
I do.
I just--

05:50.751 --> 05:52.117
Look, I don't think
my boss would let me.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.385
- You said your boss liked you.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.386
- Likes him?

05:54.388 --> 05:56.521
They share a coffee mug.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.423
- We do not, andy.

05:58.425 --> 05:59.424
Andy.

05:59.426 --> 06:00.692
Andy.

06:00.694 --> 06:04.830
Look at me when
I'm talking to you.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.432
- It's obvious
you don't want to be home, ray.

06:07.434 --> 06:09.735
- I do.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.371
Look, I'll talk
to bill tomorrow.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.505
- Bill's in there.

06:16.442 --> 06:19.511
- Thank you, andy.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.512
I'll miss you.

06:28.988 --> 06:31.456
- Okay, kids,
say good-bye to daddy.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.492
- Why isn't daddy
going to work?

06:33.494 --> 06:34.693
- Daddy's at work.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.661
I'm working at home.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.697
- Can I go to school at home?

06:38.699 --> 06:40.966
- No, you wouldn't like it.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.134
None of your friends are here.

06:42.136 --> 06:43.135
No one to talk to.

06:43.137 --> 06:44.903
All alone.

06:44.905 --> 06:45.904
- You'll be fine.

06:45.906 --> 06:46.905
- Me?
I'm happy.

06:46.907 --> 06:47.939
Look at me--

06:47.941 --> 06:50.742
I'm going to work
in my bathrobe.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.043
I'm like hugh hefner

06:52.045 --> 06:53.845
Minus everything good
about his life.

06:58.718 --> 07:00.118
- Oh, look, the guy's here
with your stuff.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.853
- Yeah.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.455
- Ray barone?
- Yeah.

07:03.457 --> 07:04.923
- Guy from tech support.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.558
Your satellite dish
is in the truck.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.527
I got your fax machine
and your modem.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.628
Where do you want it?

07:09.630 --> 07:11.196
- The office.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.664
I want it back
at the office.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.500
I want to be
back at my office.

07:15.502 --> 07:17.169
- Where do you want it?

07:17.171 --> 07:19.504
- [groans]

07:19.506 --> 07:20.772
Hook it up downstairs.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.773
- Where?

07:21.775 --> 07:24.009
- Right through that door there.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.210
Careful.

07:25.212 --> 07:28.113
Don't fall and break it...

07:28.115 --> 07:29.881
Unless you want $30.

07:31.951 --> 07:35.654
You heard me.

07:35.656 --> 07:38.056
What's going on at work?

07:38.058 --> 07:39.057
Lunch?

07:39.059 --> 07:40.792
Aw.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.794
Hey, don't order
the meatball sandwich.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.797
[chuckles]

07:47.467 --> 07:48.867
No, no, it's great.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.902
Everything's great here.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.704
Yeah, I got
one of those nice, uh,

07:52.706 --> 07:54.773
Home office setup things.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.675
Yeah.

07:56.677 --> 07:57.776
- Hello!

07:57.778 --> 07:59.244
Anybody home?

07:59.246 --> 08:00.145
- Hey, I got to go.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.586
- Debra?

08:07.588 --> 08:09.254
Are you down there?

08:09.256 --> 08:12.591
- [in high-pitched voice]
I'm not dressed!

08:12.593 --> 08:14.025
- Raymond?

08:14.027 --> 08:16.862
- He's not dressed either.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.998
- What are you doing home?

08:20.000 --> 08:20.999
Come on down.
Raymond's home.

08:21.001 --> 08:21.999
- Oh, boy.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.969
- What are you doing
in your robe, darling?

08:23.971 --> 08:24.970
You sick?

08:24.972 --> 08:26.838
- No.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.641
- You were fired?

08:29.643 --> 08:31.543
- I wasn't fired.

08:31.545 --> 08:32.978
I wanted to work at home

08:32.980 --> 08:34.546

09:03.676 --> 09:04.709

09:32.973 --> 09:35.774
I just won't get out
of the squad car, okay?

09:35.776 --> 09:38.910
Let's hope there's
no crime today.

09:38.912 --> 09:39.910
And that'll give me time

09:39.912 --> 09:41.112
To just maybe go by
the post office,

09:41.114 --> 09:42.681
And I can talk about

17:41.294 --> 17:42.493
- Wait, you're the one
who told me--

17:42.495 --> 17:44.295
- I know, ray.
I was wrong, okay?

17:44.297 --> 17:46.097
Please, go back
to the office!

17:46.099 --> 17:47.799
I can't take it!
I can't live this way!

17:47.801 --> 17:49.500
- What are you talking about?
- Just get out!

17:49.502 --> 17:51.402
- All right, calm down!

17:51.404 --> 17:53.137
- I can't! I can't!
Look at the coffee pot!

17:53.139 --> 17:54.539
Again, ray!

17:54.541 --> 17:57.742
And the schmutz
is all dripping out, and the--

17:57.744 --> 18:00.211
Look at them!

18:00.213 --> 18:02.847
God!

18:02.849 --> 18:04.449
Don't you miss your friends?

18:06.585 --> 18:08.719
- All right, all right,
I'll go back.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.488
Look, I thought I was
doing this for you.

18:10.490 --> 18:11.489
- Thanks, no.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.157
You've done enough for me.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.660
Really, okay?

18:15.662 --> 18:16.794
- It's just that...

18:16.796 --> 18:18.629
- What?

18:18.631 --> 18:20.231
- Well, I was playing
with the kids today,

18:20.233 --> 18:21.599
And it was kind of fun.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.667
You know, I like seeing them

18:22.669 --> 18:24.335
When they just come home
from school.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.404
They tell me about their lunch
and their snack,

18:26.406 --> 18:30.241
And I got
the boo-boo report.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.476
It's nice.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.510
- Yeah, I know,

18:32.512 --> 18:35.246
But, I mean, I know you,

18:35.248 --> 18:38.649
And you're gonna get tired
of that after a while,

18:38.651 --> 18:40.785
Aren't you?

18:40.787 --> 18:45.756
- Oh, yeah, I don't need
to hear it again,

18:45.758 --> 18:47.158
But it was fun today.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.159
- Good.

18:48.161 --> 18:50.161
Then that's good.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.362
So...

18:51.364 --> 18:52.463
You'll go?

18:55.167 --> 18:56.400
- You know,
I don't get you.

18:56.402 --> 18:57.735
You weren't happy
when I wasn't here,

18:57.737 --> 19:01.272
And now you're not happy
when I am here.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.907
- Yes, it's...

19:02.909 --> 19:05.743
Confusing, isn't it?

19:05.745 --> 19:06.844
Uh...

19:06.846 --> 19:09.413
Well, I guess that

19:09.415 --> 19:13.918
What I want is for you
to want to be here

19:13.920 --> 19:16.554
But not actually be here.

19:23.795 --> 19:26.631
- I can do that.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.332
You know, I can want to be here
whenever you want.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.800
- Good.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.469
That's good.

19:31.471 --> 19:34.839
And maybe you could just try
to be home for dinner sometimes.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.941
- I will.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.910
- Okay, good.

19:38.912 --> 19:41.646
Thanks, ray.

19:41.648 --> 19:42.646
So...

19:42.648 --> 19:45.416
You want to go back
to your game?

19:45.418 --> 19:48.252
- Well, I could pretend
I'm at the office

19:48.254 --> 19:50.254
And just, you know,
take a little break.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.857
[laughter]

19:52.859 --> 19:54.258
Mmm.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.459
Just like
at the office.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.461
[laughter]

20:03.335 --> 20:04.702
- "'pumpkin man,

20:04.704 --> 20:07.939
"'pumpkin man,
pumpkin man,

20:07.941 --> 20:10.608
"'why are you
looking at me like that?'

20:10.610 --> 20:11.642
Said the worm."

20:14.379 --> 20:16.247
Hey, you want to do a chapter?

20:16.249 --> 20:17.682
- Mm-mm

20:17.684 --> 20:19.650
You're the one
who had to give them a nap.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.253
You keep reading.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.789
- What time do
the cartoons start?

20:24.791 --> 20:27.725
- 5:00 a.M.

20:27.727 --> 20:28.960
- All right, come on.

20:28.962 --> 20:31.495
We're going downstairs.

20:31.497 --> 20:32.863
- Why?

20:32.865 --> 20:34.932
- Maybe there's cartoons
on in korea.
