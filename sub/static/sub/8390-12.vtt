WEBVTT

00:01.270 --> 00:04.376
- HADDIE, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR ONE SECOND ABOUT STEVE?

00:04.480 --> 00:05.549
- WHAT?

00:05.660 --> 00:06.752
- I SLEPT WITH HIM.

00:06.860 --> 00:07.724
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

00:07.830 --> 00:09.798
- I KNOW HE WAS HAVING
SOME FINANCIAL TROUBLE.

00:09.900 --> 00:11.344
HE WENT COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN

00:11.450 --> 00:12.656
ON THIS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT.

00:12.770 --> 00:13.998
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T HE
AT LEAST TELL MOM?

00:14.110 --> 00:15.384
- WHAT?

00:15.490 --> 00:18.050
- THIS IS, UH,
WHAT FAMILY IS ALL ABOUT.

00:18.150 --> 00:19.287
- MORE LIES, HUH?

00:19.390 --> 00:21.039
- I KNOW
THAT YOU CHEATED ON MOM.

00:21.150 --> 00:22.629
- THERE'S A LOT OF LYING
BEEN GOING ON

00:22.740 --> 00:23.809
FOR A LOT OF YEARS.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.808
THAT'S MATTHEW.
HE'S AMAZING.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.979
- YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY STUNNING.

00:28.090 --> 00:31.537
- BYE, DARLING.

00:31.650 --> 00:33.675
- BE CAREFUL.
STEERS FROM BEHIND, SEE?

00:33.790 --> 00:35.849
- YUP. HEY, SO THESE
ARE SORTED BY STYLE,

00:35.960 --> 00:37.439
THEN BY SIZE, RIGHT?
- THAT IS CORRECT.

00:37.550 --> 00:39.689
- HEY, WHY IS THAT SIZE 8
WITH THOSE 95 AND 9 1/25?

00:39.790 --> 00:41.758
135 AND 125 AND 85,
THEY WERE ALL MIXED UP.

00:41.860 --> 00:44.169
- WELL, THAT WOULD FALL INTO
THE CATEGORY OF HUMAN ERROR.

00:44.280 --> 00:46.999
- HMM. HEY, WHY DO PEOPLE
GO TO STORES TO BUY SNEAKERS?

00:47.110 --> 00:48.247
WHY DON'T PEOPLE
JUST COME HERE?

00:48.350 --> 00:49.794
- WELL, PEOPLE LIKE
TO HAVE A CHOICE

00:49.910 --> 00:50.831
BETWEEN DIFFERENT BRANDS,
YOU KNOW?

00:50.940 --> 00:51.861
- WHY?

00:51.980 --> 00:53.072
- TH ESE ARE
ALL GOOD QUESTIONS, MAX,

00:53.190 --> 00:55.215
BUT I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING REALLY COOL, OKAY?

00:55.330 --> 00:56.115
NOW CHECK THIS OUT, OKAY?

00:56.220 --> 00:57.539
WHAT DOES THAT
LOOK LIKE TO YOU?

00:57.640 --> 00:58.493
- IT'S A SNEAKER.

00:58.610 --> 00:59.770
- WELL, THIS IS NOT
JUST ANY SNEAKER, MAX.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.916
DO YOU SEE THIS IN THE BACK?
SEE THAT LIGHT LIGHTING UP?

01:02.020 --> 01:03.328
- YEAH.
- THIS SHOE COUNTS YOUR STEPS.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.431
AND THIS LITTLE DOOHICKEY
BACK HERE IN THE HEEL,

01:05.540 --> 01:06.848
JUST PULL THAT OUT.
THAT IS AN SD CARD.

01:06.960 --> 01:08.166
YOU CAN PLUG THAT
INTO A COMPUTER,

01:08.270 --> 01:09.612
AND IT TELLS YOU
HOW MANY STEPS YOU'VE TAKEN,

01:09.720 --> 01:11.711
WHETHER YOU'RE RUNNING,
WALKING, WHATEVER.

01:11.830 --> 01:12.444
- JOGGING?
- JOGGING TOO.

01:12.550 --> 01:13.824
WE CALL IT
THE ACCELEROMETER.

01:13.930 --> 01:14.897
- COOL.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.137
HEY,
MAYBE WE COULD USE THIS

01:16.240 --> 01:17.821
FOR THE AUTISM WALK
ON SUNDAY.

01:17.930 --> 01:18.624
WE COULD WALK ALL WEEK
WITH THESE.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.698
PROBABLY GET A LOT
MORE MILES THAT WAY,

01:20.800 --> 01:21.482
COME IN FIRST, AND WIN.

01:21.590 --> 01:24.070
- MAX, THAT IS TRULY
AN INSPIRED IDEA.

01:24.180 --> 01:25.522
THAT'S USING THE OLD NOODLE.

01:25.630 --> 01:26.836
- WHAT NOODLE?

01:26.940 --> 01:27.622
- NOODLE IN YOUR HEAD.

01:27.740 --> 01:29.048
- THERE'S NOT A NOODLE
IN MY HEAD.

01:29.150 --> 01:30.777
IT'S JUST MY BRAIN.

01:30.880 --> 01:31.778
- YOU'RE CORRECT.

01:31.880 --> 01:33.609
CHECK IT OUT, EVERYONE.

01:33.710 --> 01:35.052
CHECK IT OUT.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.559
- OKAY, WHAT'S THE
FAMILY EMERGENCY HERE?

01:36.680 --> 01:37.578
- COULD YOU JUST
GIVE ME A SECOND?

01:37.680 --> 01:38.647
- DON'T THROW MINE.
SERIOUSLY.

01:38.750 --> 01:41.218
- ...INTRODUCING A NEW LINE
OF RUNNING SHOES.

01:41.340 --> 01:42.671
- ARE THESE RETRO TO THE '905?

01:42.790 --> 01:44.508
- ARE THEY ALL SO PINK?
- I PICKED THE PINK.

01:44.620 --> 01:47.088
- NOW, THE GREAT THING
ABOUT THESE SHOES

01:47.210 --> 01:49.826
IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY
COUNT YOUR MILEAGE

01:49.930 --> 01:51.750
AS YOU WALK.

01:51.870 --> 01:53.588
- WOW, SO THEY HAVE
THE SAME TECHNOLOGY

01:53.690 --> 01:54.725
AS THE NIKES DID
FIVE YEARS AGO.

01:54.830 --> 01:55.819
THAT'S AMAZING.

01:55.940 --> 01:56.838
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DO THAT?

01:56.940 --> 01:58.214
I'M MAKING A PRESENTATION.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.901
CAN I JUST PRESENT?
- SORRY, SORRY.

02:00.010 --> 02:01.875
- HOLD FORCE, SON.
I AM LISTENING.

02:01.980 --> 02:03.140
- I'M LISTENING, DAD.

02:03.260 --> 02:05.182
- ALL RIGHT, THE AUTISM SPEAKS
WALK IS THIS SUNDAY,

02:05.290 --> 02:07.702
AND OUR VERY OWN MAX
HAD THE BRILLIANT IDEA

02:07.810 --> 02:09.254
OF USING THESE SHOES
TO COUNT OUR MILEAGE.

02:09.370 --> 02:12.259
SO WE ARE GIVING OUR SHOES
AWAY TO ALL THE TEAMS,

02:12.370 --> 02:14.838
SO THEY CAN RACK UP
THEIR MILEAGE AS THEY WALK.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.814
- THAT'S AMAZING!

02:16.920 --> 02:19.480
- AND THE WINNER
GETS A TROPHY!

02:19.580 --> 02:20.820
- A TROPHY!

02:20.930 --> 02:21.680
- WE'RE ALL GONNA WALK...

02:21.790 --> 02:24.372
- I THOUGHT THIS WOULD
BE A REALLY NICE,

02:24.480 --> 02:26.892
POSITIVE THING
FOR THE FAMILY TO DO

02:27.000 --> 02:27.864
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

02:27.970 --> 02:28.868
TEAM BRAVERMAN.

02:28.970 --> 02:30.346
- TEAM BRAVERMAN.

02:30.460 --> 02:32.974
- OKAY, EVERYBODY,
GRAB YOUR SNEAKERS, PUT 'EM ON.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.729
LET'S WALK FOR THOSE KIDS
WITH AUTISM.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.046
- YES!

02:36.150 --> 02:37.879
- ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH.

02:37.980 --> 02:39.777
- HEY.
- HE DOESN'T KNOW?

02:39.880 --> 02:41.768
- I GUESS NOT.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.734
- ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH!

02:43.850 --> 02:45.738
- ALL RIGHT.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.826
- OH, GOD.
THERE SHE IS.

02:58.930 --> 02:59.919
- WELL, LET'S WALK PAST HER.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.349
- BITCH.
- EXCUSE ME?

03:02.450 --> 03:04.793
- YOU HEARD ME.
- WHOA, TOUGH GUYS. COOL.

03:04.900 --> 03:06.310
- I LIKE YOUR GYM SHORTS.
YOU LOOK REALLY ATHLETIC.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.489
- YEAH, THEY'RE PANTS.
SO CLOSE, THOUGH.

03:07.600 --> 03:08.760
SHORTS ARE USUALLY SHORTER.

03:08.870 --> 03:10.758
- HOW CAN YOU SLEEP
WITH YOUR COUSIN'S BOYFRIEND?

03:10.880 --> 03:13.280
- I DON'T THINK THAT'S ANY
OF YOUR BUSINESS, SWEETHEART.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.321
- IT'S MY BUSINESS.

03:14.430 --> 03:15.636
- I KNOW IT'S YOUR BUSINESS,

03:15.740 --> 03:17.492
AND I TOLD YOU I WOULD TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THIS PRIVATELY,

03:17.610 --> 03:19.009
BUT I'M NOT GONNA DO IT
IN FRONT OF THESE BITCHES.

03:19.120 --> 03:20.678
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE.

03:20.780 --> 03:22.748
- EXCUSE ME?
THESE ARE MY FRIENDS.

03:22.850 --> 03:24.670
- OH, YOUR FRIENDS...
- YEAH, THESE ARE MY FRIENDS.

03:24.790 --> 03:26.405
THEY DIDN'T SLEEP
WITH MY BOYFRIEND!

03:26.510 --> 03:27.716
- OKAY,
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

03:27.820 --> 03:30.209
YOU WANT TO JUST TALK ABOUT THIS
HERE IN FRONT OF EVERYTHING?

03:30.310 --> 03:31.959
HERE'S WHY. BECAUSE I HAD
A CONNECTION WITH HIM

03:32.070 --> 03:32.968
THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE.

03:33.070 --> 03:35.209
AND I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY!

03:35.310 --> 03:39.007
I'M SORRY,
BUT THAT'S THE WAY THAT IT IS!

03:39.110 --> 03:40.839
IT SUCKS, AND I'M SORRY.

03:40.940 --> 03:44.455
- A CONNECTION?
YOU SLUT.

03:48.950 --> 03:49.803
- DON'T THROW THINGS AT ME.

03:49.910 --> 03:50.842
- YOU GUYS, STOP.

03:50.950 --> 03:53.396
- DON'T THROW THINGS AT ME!

03:53.500 --> 03:55.775
- STOP! STOP! STOP!

03:55.890 --> 03:56.777
- DO NOT PUSH ME!

03:56.890 --> 03:59.506
[arguing indistinctly]

04:04.070 --> 04:05.890
- GIRLS! HEY!
BREAK IT UP.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.228
COME HERE.

04:07.350 --> 04:08.681

04:23.810 --> 04:24.970

BOTH STUDENTS FOR FIGHTING,

04:27.610 --> 04:30.295
SO WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE
THAT THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.332
- NEVER. NEVER.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.158
- DEFINITELY NOT.

04:33.270 --> 04:35.056
[bell rings]

04:42.070 --> 04:43.139

04:43.240 --> 04:44.798
- WHAT IS GOING ON?
- LET'S GO.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.344
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.

04:46.450 --> 04:47.929
- I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE...

04:48.040 --> 04:50.031
- WELL, I DON'T WANT TO TALK

04:50.150 --> 04:52.357

04:52.460 --> 04:53.859

04:53.980 --> 04:55.288
- JUST ASK AMBER.

04:55.390 --> 04:58.211
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS?

04:58.330 --> 04:59.911
- HEY! HEY! HEY!

05:00.020 --> 05:01.009
HEY.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.394
HADDIE,

05:18.040 --> 05:19.553
- IS THAT TRUE?

05:19.660 --> 05:21.275
- DON'T. IT'S MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

05:21.390 --> 05:22.721

05:22.830 --> 05:25.799

07:38.630 --> 07:39.756
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- OW.

07:39.870 --> 07:40.825
- UM, HEY,
DO YOU KNOCK?

07:40.940 --> 07:43.727
- OW.
- OKAY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

07:43.840 --> 07:45.387
- I HAVE
AN AUDITION ON FRIDAY.

07:45.490 --> 07:47.048
- OKAY.
I'M GONNA GET ICE.

07:47.150 --> 07:49.254
- OKAY.
- AND HEAT. EVERYTHING. OKAY?

07:49.360 --> 07:50.429
- OKAY.
- I'LL BE YOUR SERVANT.

07:50.530 --> 07:51.906
OKAY.
- OW.

07:52.020 --> 07:53.464
- LET'S GO GET MOMMY
SOME ICE, OKAY?

07:53.570 --> 07:54.423
- IS SHE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

07:54.540 --> 07:55.632
- OH, I'M OKAY, HONEY.

07:55.750 --> 07:56.774
- HOW'D SHE HURT HER BACK?

07:56.890 --> 07:58.608
- I THINK SHE WAS JUMPING
ON THE BED OR SOMETHING.

07:58.710 --> 07:59.642
- BUT--
- ow.

07:59.750 --> 08:00.648
- IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.685
- OH, MOM.
COME ON, NOW.

08:03.790 --> 08:05.781
YOUR SOUP IS INCREDIBLE.
I NEED ALL THE SECRETS.

08:05.890 --> 08:08.711
- OH, SECRETS. WHY THIS SUDDEN
INTEREST IN MY CHICKEN SOUP?

08:08.830 --> 08:10.548
- OH, I'M ON THE ANGEL COMMITTEE
AT THE SCHOOL.

08:10.660 --> 08:11.866
- WHAT'S THE ANGEL COMMITTEE?

08:11.970 --> 08:14.313
- IT'S, UM,
IF A PARENT AT THE SCHOOL

08:14.420 --> 08:15.864
HAS, YOU KNOW, AN INJURY

08:15.970 --> 08:17.278
OR AN ILLNESS
OR AN OPERATION,

08:17.390 --> 08:18.311
SOME KIND OF HARDSHIP,

08:18.420 --> 08:20.593
THEN THE ANGEL COMMITTEE
IS CALLED UPON

08:20.700 --> 08:24.010
TO HELP, YOU KNOW,
BRING MEALS OR WHATEVER.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.849
- THAT'S A LOVELY THING.

08:25.950 --> 08:26.632
- ISN'T IT?

08:26.740 --> 08:28.560
- WHAT MADE YOU
SIGN UP FOR THAT?

08:28.680 --> 08:31.740
- WHAT, IT'S A--
IT'S A SURPRISE?

08:31.850 --> 08:32.987
IT'S REALLY
SO HARD TO BELIEVE?

08:33.090 --> 08:35.297
IT'S A SURPRISE
THAT I'M AN ANGEL?

08:35.410 --> 08:37.059
- NO.

08:37.170 --> 08:38.501
- FINE.

08:38.620 --> 08:39.507
JOEL SIGNED ME UP.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.099
- AH.
- AH.

08:41.210 --> 08:42.370
- I THOUGHT SO.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.038
- YOU...

08:44.140 --> 08:45.926
- OH, YOU'LL BE GREAT.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.691
- UM...

08:48.800 --> 08:53.760
SO I, UH, WAS WONDERING
IF YOU TALKED TO DAD AT ALL.

09:01.980 --> 09:04.460
WELL, IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE
THAT I CAN DO,

09:04.570 --> 09:06.049
OR ANY OF THE OTHER KIDS...

09:06.160 --> 09:07.673
- SWEETIE, THIS IS NOT
UP TO YOU TO FIX,

09:07.780 --> 09:09.054
OR YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.434
THIS IS UP
TO YOUR FATHER AND I TO FIX

09:10.550 --> 09:11.676
IF IT CAN BE FIXED.

09:11.790 --> 09:12.927
- I KNOW.
I'M JUST ASKING.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.679
- I KNOW,
BUT IT PUTS PRESSURE ON ME.

09:14.790 --> 09:16.303
TO MAKE IT WORK.

09:16.410 --> 09:18.822
AND THAT DOESN'T HELP.
PRESSURE'S NEVER HELPFUL.

09:18.930 --> 09:20.613
- RIGHT. WE DON'T HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT IT. I'M SORRY.

09:20.730 --> 09:22.345
- THANK YOU.
- OKAY. OKAY.

09:22.450 --> 09:25.658
- THANK YOU.

09:25.770 --> 09:29.979
- SO YOU THINK
DAD'LL MOVE BACK IN SOON?

09:30.080 --> 09:33.049
- NO.

09:33.150 --> 09:34.970
NO, SWEETIE, I DON'T.

09:40.710 --> 09:43.122
- SO SOME SCHMUCK
WITH HALF A CAR

09:43.230 --> 09:45.710
DELIVERED AN EASEL
TO YOUR MOTHER LAST NIGHT.

09:45.820 --> 09:46.809
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT?

09:46.930 --> 09:48.545
- UH-UH. WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THESE SHOES?

09:48.650 --> 09:49.856
- YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.689
- WHAT?
- HIS NAME IS MATTHEW.

09:51.790 --> 09:53.439
- IT'S MOM'S ART TEACHER.

09:53.550 --> 09:54.619
- YEAH.
- YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION.

09:54.730 --> 09:55.719
WHAT ABOUT THESE SHOES?

09:55.830 --> 09:57.001
DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE COMFORTABLE?

09:57.110 --> 09:58.270
- YEAH, THEY'RE COMFORTABLE,
KIND OF...

09:58.390 --> 09:59.618
- WE GOT A NEW
COMPOSITE SOLE.

09:59.730 --> 10:01.106
IT'S A LITTLE STIFFER,
BUT THEY LAST LONGER.

10:01.220 --> 10:02.869
- NOW, THEY GOT THIS CHIP
IN THERE, RIGHT?

10:02.980 --> 10:05.289
IF I WALK BACIQNARDS,
DO I REDUCE THE MILES?

10:05.390 --> 10:06.379
- NO, YOU DON'T.
COME ON.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.661
- HEY, I WANT YOU TO FIND OUT
ABOUT THIS GUY, ADAM,

10:08.780 --> 10:09.974
THIS ART TEACHER GUY.

10:10.090 --> 10:12.809
- WE'RE ACTUALLY
LEARNING ABOUT IT.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.808
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS
A WALK FOR AUTISM.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.718
AND SO MAX HAD THIS IDEA.

10:17.820 --> 10:20.641
SO WHEN WE GOT INVOLVED WITH IT,
HE DIDN'T...

10:20.750 --> 10:25.926
ADAM AND I REALLY HAVEN'T
TOLD HIM THAT HE...

10:26.030 --> 10:29.796
HE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW
THAT HE HAS ANYTHING WRONG,

10:29.900 --> 10:33.006
AND SO IT KILLS ME,
BECAUSE I SORT OF...

10:33.110 --> 10:35.726
I FEEL
LIKE I'M LYING TO HIM...

10:35.840 --> 10:40.118
BY NOT TELLING HIM ANYTHING,
AND, UM...

10:40.220 --> 10:42.802
HE'S JUST SO HAPPY TO BE
A PART OF THIS WHOLE THING,

10:42.910 --> 10:45.151
AND NOW I'M GOING,
"WHY DIDN'T I TELL HIM?

10:45.260 --> 10:47.251
WHY HAVEN'T I TOLD HIM?"

10:47.370 --> 10:50.749
- WELL, THERE'S NO
PERFECT ANSWER TO THE QUESTION

10:50.850 --> 10:52.078
OF WHEN DO YOU TELL A CHILD.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.053
- MM-HMM.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.787
- IT'S DIFFERENT
FOR EVERY KID.

10:54.890 --> 10:56.027
- SO I'M NOT
DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

10:56.130 --> 10:57.574
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

10:57.690 --> 11:02.059
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
NOT BURDEN MAX WITH INFORMATION

11:02.170 --> 11:05.867
THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE
TO PROCESS JUST YET.

11:05.970 --> 11:08.450
- SO HOW DO KIDS START TO NOTICE
THAT THEY'RE DIFFERENT?

11:08.560 --> 11:11.768
WHAT--WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SIGNS
THAT I SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR?

11:11.870 --> 11:13.349
- WELL, AS THEY GET OLDER,

11:13.460 --> 11:16.384
IT REALLY BECOMES
MORE OF A CHALLENGE SOCIALLY.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.944
- LIKE...

11:18.050 --> 11:21.747
- THE COMPLEXITIES
OF A SLEEPOVER.

11:21.850 --> 11:25.809
SOCIAL INTERACTIONS
IN A SITUATION LIKE SUMMER CAMP.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.229
- SO HE'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO GO TO CAMP,

11:28.340 --> 11:29.887
HAVE A SLEEPOVER, OR...

11:29.990 --> 11:33.858
- NO, THE CHALLENGES
ARE JUST GOING TO BE GREATER.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.712
- THAT'S GREAT.

11:35.830 --> 11:39.209
THIS JUST GETS MORE FUN,
DOESN'T IT?

11:39.310 --> 11:40.720
- IF YOU CAN,

11:40.830 --> 11:42.695
JUST TRY NOT
TO WORRY ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.212
WHEN IT'S TIME
TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT,

11:45.320 --> 11:46.526
YOU'RE GONNA KNOW.

11:46.630 --> 11:49.110
MAX IS GOING TO TELL YOU.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.853
_ WH--

12:11.100 --> 12:13.614
YOU WANT ME
TO GET SOME PAINT?

12:13.730 --> 12:16.278
- NAH. SCREW 'EM.

12:16.390 --> 12:17.789
WE'LL JUST LEAVE IT UP.

12:17.900 --> 12:22.428
SCREW 'EM ALL.

12:22.530 --> 12:24.760
LOOK,
DON'T TELL MOM, OKAY?

12:24.880 --> 12:26.393
SERIOUSLY,
SHE'S GONNA FREAK OUT.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.467
PROMISE?

12:27.570 --> 12:29.424
- YEAH.
YEAH, I PROMISE.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.986
- THANKS.

12:40.720 --> 12:41.755
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
- AH, JEEZ.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.259
- NO, I CAN'T.
- THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.

12:43.380 --> 12:44.096
- I'M SORRY, YOU GUYS.

12:44.210 --> 12:46.758
- YOU THINK
THAT HADDIE DID THIS?

12:46.860 --> 12:50.136
- UH, WELL, YEAH, I MEAN...

12:50.250 --> 12:51.171
OH, I'M SORRY.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.907
- LOOK, SARAH,
I CAN'T BELIEVE

12:53.010 --> 12:55.763
THAT HADDIE HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THAT. I CAN'T.

12:55.870 --> 12:56.859
- I MEAN,
SHE FEELS BETRAYED,

12:56.980 --> 12:58.948
BUT SHE WOULD NEVER
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT

12:59.050 --> 13:00.972
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED,
NO MATTER HOW BAD THIS IS.

13:01.090 --> 13:03.809
- UH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHO ELSE WOULD HAVE DONE IT.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.490
THE GIRLS ARE REALLY UPSET,
YOU KNOW?

13:05.610 --> 13:07.225
AND BOYFRIENDS
WILL COME AND GO,

13:07.330 --> 13:10.788
BUT THIS IS AMBER'S
REPUTATION AT A NEW SCHOOL,

13:12.130 --> 13:14.018
- I KNOW THAT HADDIE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS,

13:14.130 --> 13:15.506
BUT WE WILL TALK TO HER.
OKAY?

13:15.620 --> 13:17.201
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.

13:17.310 --> 13:18.754
I MEAN,
AMBER SLEPT WITH STEVE.

13:18.860 --> 13:19.849
YOU GUYS
ARE FORGETTING SOMETHING

13:19.970 --> 13:20.857
REALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW.

13:20.970 --> 13:22.414
NO, AMBER SLEPT WITH STEVE,

13:22.520 --> 13:24.135
AND WE'RE STANDING AROUND
TRYING TO HELP AMBER THROUGH IT?

13:24.250 --> 13:25.968
- WE'RE NOT TRYING TO HELP
AMBER THROUGH ANYTHING.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.344
AMBER MADE A MISTAKE,
AND SHE APOLOGIZED AND...

13:28.460 --> 13:29.688
- SO SHE APOLOGIZED?

13:29.800 --> 13:31.870
OKAY, THAT'S FINE.
WOW, SHE APOLOGIZED.

13:34.220 --> 13:36.848
YOU SAY, "OOH, I'M SORRY.
I MADE A BIG MISTAKE..."

13:36.950 --> 13:38.463
- IS IT SO IMPOSSIBLE
TO IMAGINE

13:38.570 --> 13:39.468
THAT HADDIE ISN'T PERFECT?

13:39.570 --> 13:40.389
OR IS IT JUST SO EASY

13:40.500 --> 13:43.742
TO BLAME EVERYTHING
ON AMBER EVERY TIME?

13:43.850 --> 13:45.294
- HEY, HEY, HEY,

13:45.410 --> 13:47.059
WE'RE NOT GONNA HELP ANYTHING
BY ARGUING, YOU GUYS.

13:47.170 --> 13:48.125
LISTEN.
SARAH, LISTEN TO ME.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.855
- PLEASE IMAGINE IF SOMEBODY
WROTE "WHORE"

13:49.960 --> 13:50.949
ON HADDIE'S LOCKER!

13:51.070 --> 13:52.788
- IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN,
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.276
- OH, AND AMBER IS A WHORE?

13:54.380 --> 13:56.860
- WHY DON'T WE TRY
TO BEHAVE LIKE ADULTS?

13:56.970 --> 14:00.030
WE WILL SPEAK TO HADDIE
ABOUT THE LOCKER, OKAY?

14:00.140 --> 14:01.903
I'M SURE SHE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS,

14:02.010 --> 14:04.456
BUT WE WILL TALK TO HER.

14:04.560 --> 14:07.142
- OKAY.

14:08.810 --> 14:10.732
I'M SORRY, KRISTINA.
I'M REALLY SORRY.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.635
- I'M REALLY SORRY TOO.

14:11.740 --> 14:12.661
- HON ESTLY.

14:12.780 --> 14:15.055
- YEAH, I KNOW.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.088
- NOW, IF KRISTINA AND SARAH
DID MIX IT UP,

14:23.200 --> 14:24.189
WHO DO YOU THINK
WINS THAT FIGHT?

14:24.310 --> 14:25.925
BECAUSE KRISTINA'S GOT REACH,

14:26.030 --> 14:27.679
BUT SARAH IS VERY SCRAPPY.

14:27.790 --> 14:30.202
SHE'S A FRESNO BARTENDER,

14:30.310 --> 14:32.551
AND THEY GOT TO BE READY TO
THROW DOWN AT THE DROP OF A HAT.

14:32.660 --> 14:33.820
NOW, I GOT TO TELL YOU,

14:33.940 --> 14:35.510
I WOULD LIKE A RING-SIDE SEAT

14:35.630 --> 14:36.904
TO THAT CAT FIGHT.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.386
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

14:38.490 --> 14:40.424
WELL, ANYWAY,
KRISTINA IS OUTRAGED

14:40.530 --> 14:41.599
ABOUT THE WHOLE BETRAYAL,

14:41.700 --> 14:43.213
SO I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT.

14:43.330 --> 14:45.116
- AND, UH, HOW DOES PAPA BEAR
FEEL ABOUT ALL THIS?

14:45.220 --> 14:46.539
- MAJOR HEADLINE FOR ME--

14:46.640 --> 14:48.255
HADDIE DIDN'T HAVE SEX.

14:48.370 --> 14:49.086
- GOOD HEADLINE.

14:49.190 --> 14:50.088
- HEADLINE NUMBER TWO

14:50.190 --> 14:51.191
IS SHE DIDN'T HAVE SEX
WITH STEVE.

14:51.300 --> 14:53.029
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT
HER FIRST TIME TO BE--

14:53.130 --> 14:53.983
- OH,
THERE'LL BE ONE TOO.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.226
- THANKS A LOT FOR THAT.

14:55.340 --> 14:57.194
WELL, ANYWAY, I DON'T WANT
IT TO BE A BAD EXPERIENCE

14:57.310 --> 14:59.198
WITH SOME GUY WHO'D GO
BREAK HER HEART, YOU KNOW?

14:59.310 --> 15:00.538
SO I JUST WANT
THE WHOLE THING TO BLOW OVER,

15:00.650 --> 15:01.753
HAVE THINGS RETURN TO NORMAL,

15:01.860 --> 15:04.727
SO WE CAN FOCUS ON IMPORTANT
THINGS LIKE SNEAKER MILEAGE.

15:04.830 --> 15:06.718
TEAM BRAVERMAN.
COME ON.

15:06.830 --> 15:08.058
- TEAM BRAVERMAN.

15:08.180 --> 15:11.525
[imitates explosion]

15:11.630 --> 15:13.905
- AH.

15:18.880 --> 15:19.801
OKAY.

15:19.910 --> 15:22.492
OKAY.

15:25.990 --> 15:27.434
- SO YOU'RE SYDNEY'S MOM?

15:27.540 --> 15:28.507
- RIGHT.

15:28.610 --> 15:30.817
AND YOU'RE, UM,
JONAH'S MOM, RIGHT?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.022
- YEAH.

15:32.130 --> 15:33.336
- COURTESY OF
THE ANGEL COMMITTEE.

15:33.440 --> 15:34.509
- OH.

15:34.620 --> 15:38.408
I AM SUCH AN EMOTIONAL WRECK,
SO--I'M...

15:38.520 --> 15:41.171
AND YOU BROUGHT SOUP,
AND THIS IS GREAT, BECAUSE--

15:41.280 --> 15:43.248
OH, SHOULDN'T LII-T.
- OH.

15:43.350 --> 15:44.965
- I'M HAVING SUCH
A HARD TIME SWALLOWING,

15:45.080 --> 15:46.001
SO THIS IS GOOD.

15:46.110 --> 15:48.078
- OH, MY GOSH.
I'M SORRY.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.863
UM, WHAT KIND OF SURGERY
DID YOU HAVE?

15:49.980 --> 15:53.279
- OH, NO ONE TOLD YOU?

15:53.400 --> 15:54.970
I GOT NEW BOOBS.

15:55.090 --> 15:57.251
BOOBS!
[laughs]

15:57.370 --> 16:00.601
- WOW, YEAH.
YOU GOT BREAST AUGMENTATION.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.598
- AREN'T THEY UNBELIEVABLE?

16:02.720 --> 16:03.607
LOOK AT THAT.

16:03.720 --> 16:04.982
I MEAN, THEY'RE JUST--

16:06.310 --> 16:07.049
- DO YOU WANT
TO CHECK 'EM OUT?

16:07.170 --> 16:08.546
- OH, I DON'T.
NO.

16:08.650 --> 16:09.856
- WILL YOU?
YOU HAVE TO.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.099
- NO, I...

16:12.210 --> 16:13.825
OH.

16:13.930 --> 16:15.409
YOU'VE EVER FELT IN YOUR LIFE,
OR WHAT?

16:15.520 --> 16:16.441
- YEP.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.276

16:17.390 --> 16:20.006

WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

16:20.110 --> 16:22.385

BECAUSE EVEN IF AUNT JULIA,

16:22.490 --> 16:24.048
IF SHE'S WALKING
AROUND HER OFFICE...

16:24.150 --> 16:26.186
- ADAM BRAVERMAN!
HIYA, MAX.

16:26.290 --> 16:27.257
- HEY.

WALKING FOR AUTISM TOO?

16:28.290 --> 16:29.359
- OH, YES, WE ARE.

16:29.470 --> 16:31.290
- MY DAD'S COMPANY
MADE THE SHOES.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.469
- OH, I SMELL
A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

16:32.570 --> 16:34.390
- THE MILEAGE IS ALL COUNTED
BY A NEUTRAL PARTY.

16:34.510 --> 16:36.011
- HE'S KIDDING.
- YEAH, I'M JUST JOKING.

16:36.130 --> 16:37.199
BUT WE ARE GONNA WIN,

16:37.300 --> 16:38.983
BECAUSE I HAVE MY WHOLE
RECUMBENT BICYCLING CLUB

16:39.100 --> 16:40.192
IN YOUR SNEAKERS.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.369
- NO, WELL,
THAT'S GONNA DO MUCH,

16:41.480 --> 16:42.572
'CAUSE THEY CYCLE.
THEY DON'T WALK.

16:42.690 --> 16:44.305
- YEAH, BUT YOU STILL
RACK UP THE MILES.

16:44.410 --> 16:45.786
- YEAH,
THEY'RE RELENTLESS TOO.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.037
- WE ARE A DRIVEN PEOPLE!

16:47.140 --> 16:48.619
- YOU KNOW,
NOEL REALLY WANTS THE TROPHY.

16:48.730 --> 16:49.719
- OH, YEAH, SO DOES MAX.

16:49.830 --> 16:51.138
- OH, YEAH,
WE'RE GONNA GET IT.

16:51.250 --> 16:53.832
- MAX, THAT MAY
OR MAY NOT HAPPEN.

16:53.940 --> 16:54.907
WHAT TIME DO YOU GO TO BED,
MAX?

16:55.010 --> 16:56.147
- 8:00.

16:56.250 --> 16:57.239
- WHAT TIME'S YOUR DAD
GO TO SLEEP?

16:57.360 --> 16:58.452
- DAD?
- AROUND MIDNIGHT.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.255
- MAX, PHIL GOES TO SLEEP
AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING.

17:00.360 --> 17:01.145
- WHAT?
- IT'S TRUE.

17:01.260 --> 17:02.249
HE EXISTS
ON THREE HOURS' SLEEP.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.349
HE'S LIKE A MACHINE.

17:03.470 --> 17:05.290
- AND I WALK UNTIL
THE MOMENT I HIT THE BED.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.219
SOMETIMES I EVEN SLEEPWALK.

17:06.330 --> 17:07.228
- HE DOES.
FRANKENSTEIN.

17:07.330 --> 17:08.536
- DAD,
WE GOT TO GET GOING.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.881
FROM THE TIME YOU GO TO BED,
THAT'S 15 MILES.

17:10.990 --> 17:12.150
- GOOD LUCK, OKAY?
WE'LL SEE YOU SUNDAY.

17:12.270 --> 17:14.238
- BYE.
- LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

17:14.340 --> 17:15.409
- NO, DON'T OUT-PACE ME.

17:15.510 --> 17:16.716
- GROTTY!

17:16.820 --> 17:18.708
HONEY, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS CHINATOWN CURE.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.582
- DR. TING IS A GENIUS.

17:20.690 --> 17:22.726
- THINK THAT'S PROBABLY
A LOOSE INTERPRETATION

17:22.830 --> 17:23.683
OF THE WORD "DOCTOR."

17:23.800 --> 17:24.448
- PLEASE JUST MAKE SURE

17:24.560 --> 17:25.868
YOU MIX IT CORRECT LY,
ALL RIGHT?

17:25.970 --> 17:27.005
IT HAS TO BE EXACT.
- OH, MY GOD.

17:27.110 --> 17:28.520
- WHAT?
- THERE ARE SEAHORSES IN HERE.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.109
- THERE'S NOT
SEAHORSES IN THERE.

17:30.220 --> 17:31.938
- THESE AREN'T SEAHORSES?

17:32.050 --> 17:33.665
- OKAY, THEY'RE SEAHORSES,
BUT IT'S FINE.

17:33.770 --> 17:35.590
- IT'S FINE?
- HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING...

17:35.700 --> 17:37.520
- HE'S CLEANING OUT HIS
AQUARIUM, IS WHAT HE'S DOING.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.868
- HE CURED ME OF THE FLU
IN 12 HOURS.

17:38.980 --> 17:40.083
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

17:40.190 --> 17:41.748
- WELL, I'M NOT MAKING YOU
TEA WITH SEAHORSES.

17:41.850 --> 17:43.772
THESE COULD BE ON
THE ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST...

17:43.890 --> 17:45.152
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE MY SERVANT.

17:45.270 --> 17:46.532
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT, THEN SERVE,

17:46.650 --> 17:47.537
AND POUR THE TEA PLEASE.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.789
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL BE YOUR SERVANT.

17:49.890 --> 17:51.232
I'LL MAKE YOU SEAHORSE TEA.

17:51.340 --> 17:53.262
- THANK YOU.
GOD.

17:53.380 --> 17:54.756
- LISTEN, IF YOU START
SPEAKING IN TONGUES

17:54.860 --> 17:55.679
AFTER YOU DRINK THIS,

17:55.790 --> 17:58.236
AM I GONNA BE ABLE
TO GET AHOLD OF DR. TING?

17:58.350 --> 18:02.832
DOES HE USE A PHONE?

18:02.940 --> 18:04.316
DIG IN.

18:04.420 --> 18:07.355
DO YOU WANT A FORK
FOR THAT SEAHORSE?

18:11.330 --> 18:14.185
- YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

18:14.300 --> 18:15.847
- YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

18:15.950 --> 18:18.327
- NOT FROM YOU, I DON'T.

18:18.440 --> 18:21.785
- WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

18:21.890 --> 18:24.882
- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

18:26.960 --> 18:31.033
MY LOVE.
WHAT HAPPENED?

18:31.140 --> 18:33.176
- I DON'T KNOW.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.759
I DON'T KNOW.

18:34.870 --> 18:38.419
I FEEL LIKE THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING REALLY WRONG WITH ME.

18:38.530 --> 18:40.452
'CAUSE IT SEEMS SO TERRIBLE.

18:40.560 --> 18:44.212
IT SEEMS LIKE THE WORST THING
I COULD HAVE DONE.

18:44.330 --> 18:47.151
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.809
BUT ALSO, LIKE,
I REALLY LIKE HIM, MOM.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.059
I REALLY LIKE HIM SO MUCH.

18:53.160 --> 18:56.220
AND IT SUCKS
'CAUSE OF THE SITUATION,

18:56.340 --> 18:58.126
BUT I DIDN'T JUST DO IT,

18:58.240 --> 19:00.617
YOU KNOW, LIKE IT WASN'T,
LIKE, NOT A BIG DEAL.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.280
IT WAS A BIG DEAL.
IT JUST SUCKS.

19:03.380 --> 19:05.132
- AND THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH YOU.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.959
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH YOU.

19:08.070 --> 19:11.517
- SORRY I MESSED EVERYTHING UP.

19:11.630 --> 19:15.179
- IT'S OKAY.

19:15.290 --> 19:26.815
IT'S OKAY.

19:26.920 --> 19:27.602
- HELLO.

19:27.710 --> 19:29.439
- WHAT DID YOU DO
TO LUCY ESTMAN?

19:29.540 --> 19:31.223
- WHAT?
WHAT DID I DO?

19:31.340 --> 19:33.786
- SHE TOLD AMY POPCHEC
THAT YOU GAVE HER ATTITUDE.

19:33.890 --> 19:35.061
- WHAT?

19:35.170 --> 19:36.990
- AND AMY POPCHEC
PROCEEDED TO TELL

19:37.100 --> 19:39.091
EVERY PARENT AT SCHOOL.

19:39.210 --> 19:41.485
- I SPENT THREE HOURS
THAT I TOOK OFF WORK

19:41.590 --> 19:43.205
TAKING CARE OF A WOMAN
WITH A BOOB JOB?

19:43.320 --> 19:48.030
- IS IT TRUE
THAT YOU GAVE HER FAKE SOUP?

19:48.150 --> 19:49.663
- FAKE?

19:49.770 --> 19:50.737
NO.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.250
- NO?
- NO.

19:52.360 --> 19:55.944
- APPARENTLY, SHE REQUESTED
ONLY HOME-COOKED FOOD,

19:56.050 --> 20:00.009
AND, UM, SHE FOUND A RECEIPT
FLOATING IN THE SOUP.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.985
THAT'S WEIRD, RIGHT?

20:02.090 --> 20:04.024
I MEAN...

20:04.130 --> 20:05.916
THAT'S NOT AN INGREDIENT.

20:06.030 --> 20:09.022
- OH! FINE.

20:09.130 --> 20:10.165
I GOT A LOT ON MY PLATE.

20:10.270 --> 20:12.090
I'M REALLY SUPPOSED
TO HELP LUCY ESTMAN

20:12.210 --> 20:14.303
REGENERATE FROM
HER BREAST AUGMENTATION?

20:14.420 --> 20:16.376
- SWEETHEART, I HAD TO GO
PICK UP SYD AT SCHOOL TODAY,

20:16.490 --> 20:18.060
AND I GOT A LOT
OF COLD STARES.

20:18.180 --> 20:21.411
ICY. FRIGID. OKAY?

20:21.530 --> 20:23.213
SO JUST DO ME A FAVOR.

20:23.320 --> 20:26.187
AS ABSURD AS THIS IS,
JUST...

20:26.290 --> 20:27.382
WOULD YOU PLEASE. . .?

20:29.330 --> 20:31.116
OF THIS THING WITH MY FOLKS.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.084
THEY'RE...

20:33.190 --> 20:36.842
- YES.

20:36.950 --> 20:39.089
- SOUP?

20:39.200 --> 20:41.122
- SOUP.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.127
- FOR YOU.
NOT FOR HER.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.162
- YOU.

20:44.270 --> 20:46.579
- GOOD GRACIOUS.

20:46.690 --> 20:48.203
- TA-DA.

20:48.310 --> 20:49.231
BREAKFAST IS SERVED.

20:49.350 --> 20:50.863
- I'M LIKING THIS.

20:50.970 --> 20:52.062
- OH.

20:52.180 --> 20:54.557
AND LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

20:54.660 --> 20:56.457
LITTLE ARTICLE
ABOUT ALVIN AILEY.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.345
- MM.

20:57.460 --> 20:58.381
- SAYS HERE THEY'RE LOOKING

20:58.490 --> 21:00.424
FOR A VERY SPECIFIC DANCER,

21:00.530 --> 21:02.760
ONE BY THE NAME
OF JASMINE TRUSSELL.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.142
- HA.

21:04.260 --> 21:05.704
- YOU KNOW, YOU, UM,

21:05.810 --> 21:10.156
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
THEY WERE IN NEW YORK.

21:10.260 --> 21:12.148
- EVERYBODY KNOWS
THEY'RE IN NEW YORK.

21:12.270 --> 21:13.157
- I DIDN'T.

21:13.270 --> 21:15.431
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S,
YOU KNOW,

21:15.550 --> 21:18.166
SOMETHING WE SHOULD...
TALK ABOUT?

21:18.270 --> 21:20.329
- THERE'S NOTHING REALLY
TO TALK ABOUT.

21:20.450 --> 21:21.826
I'M NOT GONNA GET IT.

21:21.930 --> 21:23.340
- OKAY, WELL,
WHAT IF YOU DO GET IT?

21:23.450 --> 21:24.826
- WELL, I'M NOT.

21:24.930 --> 21:26.682
- OKAY, BUT IN SOME CRAZY WORLD
WHERE YOU GET IT,

21:26.800 --> 21:27.869
THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

21:27.970 --> 21:29.130
- I'M NOT GONNA GET IT.
IT'S A LONG SHOT.

21:29.250 --> 21:30.274
REALLY.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.698
THE ONLY REASON
WHY I'M DOING THIS

21:31.800 --> 21:34.667
IS TO SEE IF I
STILL HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

21:39.740 --> 21:42.425
HEY.

21:42.540 --> 21:44.531
CAN I GET ONE OF YOUR, UH,

21:44.640 --> 21:47.222
WONDERFUL FOOT MASSAGES?

21:47.340 --> 21:51.959
- WELL, THEY DON'T HAVE THESE
FOOT MASSAGES IN NEW YORK.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.095
- PLEASE.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.714
MASSAGE.

21:55.830 --> 21:58.822
IT'S PART OF MY BACK THERAPY.

21:58.930 --> 22:02.206
- OKAY, WELL, I'M GONNA HAVE
A LAWYER LOOK AT MY CONTRACT.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.788
THINK YOU MIGHT BE
EXPLOITING YOUR SERVANT.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.087
- THIS TASTES REAL.

22:14.190 --> 22:16.112
- I HEARD YOU COMPLAINED
TO THE SCHOOL ABOUT MY SOUP,

22:16.230 --> 22:17.879
SO THERE YOU GO.

22:17.990 --> 22:19.366
- [laughs]
COME ON.

22:19.470 --> 22:20.983
I MEAN,
THAT WAS HARDLY HOMEMADE.

22:21.090 --> 22:23.297
I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
WITH PROCESSED FOODS.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.787
ESPECIALLY SINCE MY SURGERY.

22:25.890 --> 22:28.609
- OKAY,
YOU HAD ELECT IVE SURGERY.

22:28.720 --> 22:31.348
THAT'S COMPLETELY FINE WITH ME
THAT YOU WANTED BIGGER BREASTS,

22:31.450 --> 22:32.519
BUT I DON'T SEE
HOW THAT JUSTIFIES

22:32.620 --> 22:34.235
ASKING PARENTS
AT THE SCHOOL FOR HELP.

22:34.350 --> 22:35.556
I'M SORRY.
I THINK THAT'S LUDICROUS.

22:35.660 --> 22:36.729
- OKAY, SEE, YOU KNOW WHAT...
- I'M SORRY.

22:36.830 --> 22:38.104
- I KNEW YOU HAD AN ATTITUDE.

22:38.210 --> 22:39.347
YOU HAVE AN ATTITUDE.

22:39.460 --> 22:42.213
YOU ARE PREJUDICED AGAINST
SMALL-BREASTED WOMEN.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.173
I KNEW IT.

22:43.290 --> 22:44.143
- I'M GONNA GO NOW.

22:44.250 --> 22:45.569
- I'M SORRY.

22:45.670 --> 22:47.149
WE'RE NOT ALL ENDOWED,
YOU KNOW, NATURALLY,

22:47.260 --> 22:48.420
LIKE YOU ARE.

22:48.530 --> 22:49.804
- OKAY, I HAVE A REAL CRISIS
AT HOME TO DEAL WITH.

22:49.920 --> 22:52.150
MY PARENTS ARE SPLITTING UP,
SO...

22:52.260 --> 22:53.249
- NO.

22:53.370 --> 22:54.325
OH, MY GOD.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.499
- UM...
- I'M SO...

22:56.610 --> 22:58.191
I'M SO SORRY.

22:58.300 --> 22:59.289
- NO, THAT, UM...

22:59.410 --> 23:00.889
THAT JUST SLIPPED OUT.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.308
THAT'S NOT...

23:02.410 --> 23:03.786
THEY'RE FINE.

23:03.890 --> 23:05.755
- DID YOUR DAD
HAVE AN AFFAIR?

23:05.860 --> 23:07.680
- NO.

23:07.800 --> 23:13.147
- MY HUSBAND LEI-T ME
FOR A YOUNGER WOMAN.

23:13.250 --> 23:15.411
- SORRY.
I HAD NO IDEA.

23:19.050 --> 23:21.109
[murmurs]

23:24.500 --> 23:27.082
IS THAT, UM,
WHY YOU...

23:27.190 --> 23:28.225
- OH, SUPERSIZED?

23:28.330 --> 23:29.297
- YEAH.

23:29.400 --> 23:32.847
- SORT OF.
[mutters]

23:32.960 --> 23:34.951
IT'S JUST SO HARD
FOR A WOMAN MY AGE

23:35.060 --> 23:36.334
TO PUT HERSELF OUT THERE.

23:36.440 --> 23:40.854
YOU KNOW?

23:40.970 --> 23:43.552
IMAGINE WHAT IT'S GOT
TO BE LIKE FOR YOUR MOM.

23:52.770 --> 23:54.522
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.528
WE ONLY HAVE ONE MORE DAY.
WHY ISN'T EVERYONE WALKING?

23:56.640 --> 23:57.527
- BE RIGHT THERE.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.323
- ALL RIGHT.
COMING.

23:59.430 --> 24:01.364
MAN, HE REALLY WANTS
THAT TROPHY.

24:01.470 --> 24:02.744
HE'S OBSESSED.

24:02.850 --> 24:04.647
- YEAH, I KNOW, AND WE'RE
COMPETING AGAINST PHIL LESSING,

24:04.750 --> 24:06.229
AND THE MAN HAS NO LIFE
AND NEEDS NO SLEEP.

24:06.340 --> 24:07.500
- NO KIDDING.

24:07.610 --> 24:09.407
HONEY, I, UM...

24:09.510 --> 24:11.614
I MET WITH DR. PELIKAN
ABOUT MAX,

24:11.720 --> 24:13.369
ABOUT WHEN TO TALK TO HIM
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.095
- YEAH?

24:15.210 --> 24:17.269
- YEAH, AND HE SAID THAT WE'LL
KNOW WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

24:17.380 --> 24:18.688
- HE SAID THAT WE'D KNOW?

24:18.800 --> 24:20.654
- YEAH. LIKE MAX
WILL START ASKING QUESTIONS.

24:20.760 --> 24:21.931
I MEAN,
I--I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.621
I DON'T GET IT.
IT WAS NOT COMFORTING AT ALL.

25:25.660 --> 25:27.514
AND, LIKE,
MAKING PEOPLE FEEL BAD.

25:27.620 --> 25:29.178
THIS IS ABOUT MY FAMILY.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.114
YOU'RE GOING
ON THE WALK TOMORROW.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.415
KRISTINA, CAN YOU
LET ME TALK TO HER, PLEASE?

32:59.520 --> 33:01.624
- YES. GO TALK TO HER.
I'M SORRY.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.937
- MIGHT NOT SEEM FAIR FOR ME
TO ASK YOU TO RISE ABOVE THIS

33:04.050 --> 33:05.529
AND SHOW UP TOMORROW,

33:05.630 --> 33:06.699
BUT I WANT YOU TO.

33:06.810 --> 33:07.697
- I'M NOT GOING
IF AMBER'S GOING.

33:07.810 --> 33:10.278
- OKAY, WE UNDERSTAND THAT.
WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.083
- NO, I DON'T--NO,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, KRISTINA.

33:12.190 --> 33:13.179
LISTEN TO ME FOR A SECOND.

33:13.300 --> 33:15.120
AND ONE DAY
WE'RE ALL GONNA GET OLD,

33:15.230 --> 33:16.436
AND ONE OF US
IS GONNA BE GONE,

33:16.540 --> 33:17.984
AND WE'RE GONNA REGRET
EVERY SINGLE DAY

33:18.090 --> 33:19.409
THAT WE DIDN'T SPEND
LOVING EACH OTHER.

33:19.510 --> 33:20.499
- OKAY,
YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

33:20.610 --> 33:22.191
CAN YOU STEP OUTSIDE
FOR A SECOND, PLEASE?

33:22.310 --> 33:23.641
JUST FOR ONE MOMENT.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.204
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT ONE THING.

33:25.310 --> 33:27.028
- SURE.
- JUST ONE THING, OKAY?

33:29.690 --> 33:31.578
DO YOU WANT TO CALL YOUR SISTER,
OR SHOULD I DO IT?

33:31.690 --> 33:32.588
BECAUSE AMBER IS NOT GOING.

33:32.700 --> 33:33.894
SHE'S NOT GOING.

33:34.010 --> 33:35.409
- WHAT, ARE YOU DELIVERING
ME AN ULTIMATUM?

33:35.530 --> 33:36.519
- YEP. SURE AM.
DEAL WITH IT.

33:36.630 --> 33:38.143
- WELL, I AM NOT GONNA DO THAT
TO MY FAMILY.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.558
I'M NOT GONNA
UN-INVITE MY FAMILY.

33:39.670 --> 33:41.388
- ADAM, WE ARE YOUR FAMILY.
WE ARE YOUR FAMILY.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.320
- OKAY, LISTEN. I WANT TO MAKE
A UNILATERAL DECISION HERE.

33:43.430 --> 33:44.465
I WANT THIS TO BE MY CALL.

33:44.570 --> 33:45.912
I WANT HADDIE TO GO
AND I WANT AMBER TO GO.

33:46.020 --> 33:47.226
- OKAY, FINE.
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:47.330 --> 33:48.251
YOU TELL HER THAT, ADAM.

33:48.370 --> 33:49.439
YOU TELL YOUR DAUGHTER THAT.

33:49.540 --> 33:50.359
- OKAY, I WILL.

33:50.470 --> 33:51.880
- ONE BIG
HAPPY FREAKIN' FAMILY.

33:51.990 --> 33:53.537
- ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

33:53.650 --> 33:56.096
- SUPER.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.379
- HADDIE, CAN YOU SIT UP
FOR ME, PLEASE?

34:06.250 --> 34:07.137
I KNOW THIS IS HARD,

34:07.250 --> 34:08.478
AND I KNOW
HOW HURT YOU MUST FEEL.

34:08.590 --> 34:10.148
- THEN WHY AREN'T YOU
ON MY SIDE?

34:10.250 --> 34:11.933
- I AM ON YOUR SIDE.

34:12.050 --> 34:12.971
OKAY?

34:13.080 --> 34:14.149
YOUR MOTHER AND I SPOKE,

34:14.250 --> 34:16.002
AND SHE AGREED
THAT THIS IS MY CALL,

34:16.120 --> 34:17.633
BECAUSE TOMORROW
IS MY SHINDIG.

34:17.740 --> 34:19.799
AND I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
ROLL YOUR EYES,

34:19.910 --> 34:22.674
BUT ASKING YOU TO DO THIS
IS BEING ON YOUR SIDE.

34:22.780 --> 34:24.771
IN A BIGGER WAY.

34:24.890 --> 34:28.098
HADDIE,
YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH LIFE

34:28.200 --> 34:31.169
ALLOWING YOUR PAIN TO DICT ATE
HOW YOU BEHAVE.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.545
IT'S EASY TO SIT HERE
IN YOUR BEDROOM

34:33.650 --> 34:35.060
AND WALLOW
IN YOUR HURT FEELINGS.

34:35.170 --> 34:37.138
IT'S HARD TO RISE ABOVE IT.

34:37.240 --> 34:39.208
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.
IT'S NOT ABOUT AMBER.

34:39.310 --> 34:41.483
THIS IS ABOUT MAX.

34:41.590 --> 34:42.659
I'M NOT GONNA FORCE YOU TO GO,

34:42.770 --> 34:46.592
BUT I'M ASKING YOU
TO DO THIS FOR ME.

34:46.700 --> 34:48.759
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

34:53.850 --> 34:57.183
- YEAH.

34:57.300 --> 34:59.746
- ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

35:13.070 --> 35:13.923
- COME ON! I'M NOT KIDDING!

35:14.040 --> 35:15.246
WE'RE LATE! LET'S GO!

35:15.350 --> 35:16.794
- ALL RIGHT. STOP YELLING.
I'M NOT GOING.

35:16.900 --> 35:18.720
- WHY ISN'T YOUR SHIRT ON?
- BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING.

35:18.840 --> 35:20.216
- PUT YOUR TEAM SHIRT ON.
- NO, I'M NOT GOING.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.548
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO.

35:21.670 --> 35:23.183
- I THOUGHT YOU JUST SAID,
"I'M NOT GOING."

35:23.290 --> 35:25.906
- NOT PHYSICALLY,
NOT EMOTIONALLY, NOT MENTALLY.

35:26.020 --> 35:26.907
NOT IN ANY WAY.

35:27.020 --> 35:27.941
- HI! LET'S GO!

35:28.050 --> 35:29.938
- WAIT, YOU'RE NOT GOING?

35:30.050 --> 35:31.256
- LISTEN,
NOBODY WANTS ME THERE.

35:31.370 --> 35:32.678
- NO,
I'M NOT GOING EITHER NOW.

35:32.780 --> 35:33.565
- PUT ON YOUR--WHAT?

35:33.680 --> 35:35.079
- WHAT?
I'M, LIKE, HER WINGMAN.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.531
- NO, NO.

35:36.650 --> 35:38.857
NO,
YOU'RE UNCLE ADAM'S WINGMAN.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.882
YOU GUYS,
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.264
WE HAVE TO GO, OKAY?

35:43.380 --> 35:44.540
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME NOW!

35:44.650 --> 35:47.346
WE ALL HAVE TO GO AS A FAMILY
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME!

35:47.450 --> 35:50.419
GET YOUR CUTE RED SHIRT ON
AND GET IN THE CAR!

35:50.520 --> 35:52.385
- WE LOOK SO EMBARRASSING.

35:52.490 --> 35:53.388
- HEY.
HELLO, EVERYBODY.

35:53.490 --> 35:54.900
GUESS WHAT?
WE'RE NOT GOING.

35:55.010 --> 35:58.047
YOU FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT,
BUT WE'RE STAYING HOME.

35:58.150 --> 35:59.219
- MOM.

35:59.320 --> 36:00.969
- SWEETIE, SOMETIMES
BEING THE PERFECT PARENT

36:01.080 --> 36:03.082
JUST ISN'T WORTH THE BLOOD
ON THE FLOOR, YOU KNOW?

36:03.190 --> 36:04.179
AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE DEALING

36:04.300 --> 36:06.256
WITH YOUR FATHER
RIGHT NOW, ANYWAYS.

36:06.370 --> 36:08.122
SO I'LL CALL ADAM.

36:08.230 --> 36:10.915
HE'LL UNDERSTAND.
AND I'M GONNA MAKE WAFFLES.

36:12.410 --> 36:14.958
- YEAH, DEFINITELY.
- YEAH.

36:20.030 --> 36:22.419
- CAN YOU MAKE PANCAKES TOO?

36:32.700 --> 36:33.735
- WANT YOlIJIIESAUSAGE?

36:33.840 --> 36:37.048
- YOU'RE DONE?
OKAY.

36:37.160 --> 36:38.320
SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT SUNSCREEN.

36:38.430 --> 36:39.840
I'M SORRY.
ARE YOU GETTING BURNED?

36:39.950 --> 36:40.917
- PROBABLY.

36:41.020 --> 36:42.635
- WELL,
NOW JULIA'S NOT COMING

36:42.750 --> 36:44.149
BECAUSE SHE'S TAKING CARE
OF LUCY ESSMAN.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.157
- BUT WHY IS YOUR MOM
NOT HERE?

36:45.270 --> 36:46.817
- WELL, SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE SHOWING UP

36:46.920 --> 36:47.784
WITH SARAH AND THE KIDS,

36:47.890 --> 36:51.018
BUT APPARENTLY
THEY CAN'T BE BOTHERED.

36:51.130 --> 36:52.995
- HONEY, I'M SORRY.

36:53.100 --> 36:55.307
WE'RE HERE.

36:55.420 --> 36:56.990
- I KNOW. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

36:57.110 --> 36:58.623

I HOPE WE WIN.

36:58.730 --> 36:59.958
- YEAH,
I HOPE YOU WIN TOO, BUD.

37:00.070 --> 37:02.072
I JUST WISH THE REST OF THE
FAMILY COULD BE HERE WITH US.

37:02.180 --> 37:03.101
- THEIR MILEAGE IS COUNTED.

37:03.220 --> 37:04.073
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.249
- YUP,
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

37:05.360 --> 37:06.384

ABOUT TO CALL YOU.

38:29.990 --> 38:32.436

38:32.550 --> 38:33.949

UGH.

WELL, WE WON, BY THE WAY.

38:38.790 --> 38:40.724

- YEAH. ISN'T THAT GREAT?

38:40.830 --> 38:43.139
AND AUTISM SPEAKS WANTED
EVERYBODY TO HAVE A CERTIFICATE.

38:43.250 --> 38:46.651
THEY WERE REALLY APPRECIATIVE.
HERE.

38:46.770 --> 38:49.659
YOU KNOW, SARAH, I HAD TO WORK
SO UNBELIEVABLY HARD

38:49.770 --> 38:51.829
TO GET MY FAMILY THERE TODAY.

38:51.950 --> 38:54.737
I FORCED HADDIE TO GO, KNOWING
THAT AMBER WAS GONNA BE THERE.

38:54.840 --> 38:57.604
SHE HATES ME.
YOU GUYS COULDN'T EVEN SHOW UP.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.154
- I WORKED
SO UNBELIEVABLY HARD

38:59.260 --> 39:00.568
TO TRY TO GET MY FAMILY
TO BE THERE,

39:00.680 --> 39:01.817
AND I FAILED
AND YOU SUCCEEDED.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.569
IT'S NO BIG SURPRISE.
- OH, GOD.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.568
- LOOK, WE HAD
A RIDICULOUS FIGHT,

39:05.680 --> 39:09.639
AND MOM JUST SAID, "DON'T GO,"
AND I AGREED.

39:09.760 --> 39:12.854
- OH, SO IT'S MOM'S FAULT
THAT YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT THERE?

39:17.180 --> 39:20.240
AMBER LIED.

39:20.350 --> 39:22.318
SHE'S STILL SEEING STEVE.

39:22.420 --> 39:24.809
HADDIE WALKED IN ON THEM
KISSING AT SCHOOL.

39:33.330 --> 39:35.890
- I'M SORRY.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.508
OH, ADAM, I'M SO TIRED
OF BEING THE PROBLEM.

39:41.620 --> 39:43.679
- WELL,
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

39:43.790 --> 39:45.781
- WELL,
I'M JUST BEGINNING TO FEEL

39:45.900 --> 39:47.788
LIKE MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST MOVE BACK, YOU KNOW?

39:47.900 --> 39:50.414
MAYBE THIS WHOLE THING
WAS JUST A BIG MISTAKE.

39:53.520 --> 39:55.408
- NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

39:59.250 --> 40:01.184
GOOD NIGHT.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.824
- OH, SWEETIE,
IT'S WONDERFUL.

40:20.930 --> 40:22.443
- IT IS?

40:22.550 --> 40:24.347
- IT'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

40:24.450 --> 40:25.303
IT'S NOT--
- NOT YOURS.

40:25.420 --> 40:26.728
- NOT MINE.

40:26.830 --> 40:29.242
NO,
BUT IT'S EVERY BIT AS GOOD.

40:29.350 --> 40:31.170
- GOOD.

40:31.290 --> 40:32.109
- BUT YOU DID SOMETHING.

40:32.220 --> 40:34.245
- MM.

40:34.360 --> 40:35.634
- IS THAT CUMIN?
- IT'S CUMIN.

40:35.740 --> 40:37.458
- YOU LITTLE DEVIL.

40:37.570 --> 40:38.525
- YOU LIKE IT?

40:38.640 --> 40:40.779
- IT'S--IT'S VERY INTERESTING.

40:40.880 --> 40:42.871
AND, NO, IT WORKS.
IT WORKS.

40:42.990 --> 40:45.777
THIS REALLY IS GOOD.
- THANK YOU.

40:45.890 --> 40:48.950
- I NEVER WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF IT, BUT...

40:49.060 --> 40:52.507
OH. OKAY,
I GUESS THAT'S ENOUGH, HUH?

40:56.590 --> 40:57.579
- MOM, I DON'T KNOW.

40:57.690 --> 40:59.726
I GUESS I'M BEING
KIND OF SELFISH.

40:59.830 --> 41:03.721
IT SCARES ME, THE IDEA
OF YOU GUYS NOT BEING TOGETHER.

41:03.840 --> 41:08.072
- I KNOW.

41:08.180 --> 41:09.693
- BUT I WANT TO...

41:09.810 --> 41:12.085
WANT TO BE THERE FOR YOU.

41:12.190 --> 41:14.044
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

41:14.160 --> 41:19.951
YOU KNOW,
IT CAN'T BE EASY.

41:20.060 --> 41:22.528
- THANK YOU, SWEETIE.

41:22.650 --> 41:24.925
MEANS THE WORLD TO ME.

41:26.760 --> 41:30.753
SEE?
YOU ARE AN ANGEL.

41:30.860 --> 41:34.136
MY ANGEL.

41:34.250 --> 41:38.721
LET'S HAVE SOME MORE SOUP.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.592
ARE THERE NOODLES
IN THE BOTTOM?

41:40.700 --> 41:42.622
- YEAH, DIG FOR THE NOODLES.
THERE THEY ARE.

41:42.740 --> 41:44.901
- OH, THE TWISTY ONES.
- OOH.

41:45.010 --> 41:46.944
- HOW ABOUT RIGHT UP THERE
WHERE THAT ANT IS?

41:47.050 --> 41:48.972
'CAUSE THAT DOESN'T REALLY
GO WITH ALL THOSE AIRPLANES.

41:49.090 --> 41:52.708
- NO, NO, 'CAUSE THEN IT BLOCKS
OUT THE SAILBOAT PAINTING.

41:52.820 --> 41:54.913
- OKAY. HOW ABOUT
RIGHT UP HERE ON YOUR DRESSER?

41:55.020 --> 41:57.500
- UH, NO, BECAUSE THEN
IT'LL BLOCK THE HAND PAINTING.

41:57.610 --> 41:58.986
- OKAY.
HOW ABOUT RIGHT UP HERE?

41:59.100 --> 42:00.954
THAT WON'T BLOCK ANYTHING
IF I TAKE THOSE DOWN, RIGHT?

42:01.070 --> 42:01.809
RIGHT HERE?

42:01.930 --> 42:03.022
- RIGHT HERE.
- OKAY.

42:03.140 --> 42:05.370
OH, YOU GONNA
TRY AND PUT IT UP THERE?

42:05.480 --> 42:06.993
NEED SOME HELP?
HERE WE G0. I GOT IT.

42:07.110 --> 42:07.895
- FLIP IT. FLIP IT.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.410

42:09.520 --> 42:10.748

WALKATHON.‘l

42:13.870 --> 42:15.906
- FIRST PLACE.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

42:16.010 --> 42:20.288
- HEY, WHY DID WE
GIVE THE MONEY TO AUTISM?

42:20.390 --> 42:25.874
PLENTY OF OTHER CHARITIES.

42:25.990 --> 42:28.151
- WELL,
THEY HAD THE BEST TROPHY.

42:28.260 --> 42:32.128
- THAT IS A COOL TROPHY.

42:32.230 --> 42:35.370
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THE OTHER
CHARITIES HAVE BETTER TROPHIES.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.754
- YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THAT TROPHY

42:36.860 --> 42:38.543
UNLESS YOU THOUGHT
