00:25.538 --> 00:28.225
Okay, one last box, and
I'm ready for college.

00:28.673 --> 00:30.199
Sweetheart, this is a lot of stuff.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.479
You do realize, you don't have
to take all of this stuff

00:32.481 --> 00:33.679
with you to your dorm room?

00:33.928 --> 00:35.038
Like this. What is this?

00:35.461 --> 00:38.317
Remember? I wanted to ride my
bike without training wheels,

00:38.420 --> 00:40.059
like the big kids, and I did.

00:40.217 --> 00:42.463
So you got me my very own gold medal.

00:42.464 --> 00:45.556
Oh, well, honey, that is...
that's a very sweet memory,

00:45.557 --> 00:48.338
but your dorm room is only so big.

00:48.339 --> 00:50.499
You're gonna have to leave
some of this stuff behind.

00:50.500 --> 00:51.660
Don't listen to him, darling.

00:51.661 --> 00:52.885
Everybody needs their stuff.

00:53.649 --> 00:54.251
See?

00:58.655 --> 01:00.323
My little girl is going to college.

01:00.417 --> 01:01.457
Seems like just yesterday,

01:01.458 --> 01:03.258
you were checking under
the bed every night,

01:03.259 --> 01:05.373
promising her that monsters aren't real.

01:05.379 --> 01:07.099
Well, I lied. Monsters are real.

01:07.662 --> 01:09.282
They're the boys in her freshman dorm.

01:09.860 --> 01:11.553
Oh, speaking of which,

01:12.002 --> 01:14.892
before Alexis leaves, don't you
think you should have the, uh,

01:15.354 --> 01:16.160
talk with her?

01:16.209 --> 01:18.596
You mean the sex talk? Mother,
I covered that ages ago.

01:18.706 --> 01:19.651
I learned so much.

01:19.663 --> 01:22.279
I mean the you-and-Beckett sex talk.

01:22.280 --> 01:23.392
Mother, Beckett and I ar...

01:23.393 --> 01:24.517
Save it, Richard.

01:24.971 --> 01:26.407
I knew the morning I walked in here

01:26.408 --> 01:27.928
and the poor girl was hiding in the...

01:27.929 --> 01:29.054
You...
Shh.

01:29.621 --> 01:31.101
How did you know that? Shh, shh, shh.

01:31.102 --> 01:32.142
Mothers know these things.

01:32.493 --> 01:35.350
But I don't think you want
Alexis to walk in unannounced

01:35.351 --> 01:38.244
and find you and Beckett...
out of the closet.

01:38.245 --> 01:39.405
And by "out of the closet"...

01:39.406 --> 01:42.042
I... no, I-I-I know what you
mean by "out of the closet."

01:42.043 --> 01:42.890
Okay, so...

01:44.574 --> 01:46.014
Don't you think you should tell her?

01:46.094 --> 01:46.794
Tell me what?

01:48.392 --> 01:49.600
You told Alexis?

01:49.646 --> 01:52.128
I didn't want to. Mother used
her jedi mind tricks on me.

01:52.129 --> 01:53.287
She knows, too?

01:53.522 --> 01:55.619
Castle, do they realize
what's at stake here?

01:55.620 --> 01:57.237
Because if Alexis tells lanie...

01:57.238 --> 01:58.450
Alexis won't tell lanie.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.762
Lanie's gonna tell Esposito,

01:59.763 --> 02:02.063
Esposito can't keep his
mouth shut with Ryan,

02:02.064 --> 02:03.784
and Ryan's gonna blow it out of proportion,

02:03.785 --> 02:05.105
and then gates is gonna find out,

02:05.106 --> 02:06.986
and we won't be able to
work together anymore.

02:06.987 --> 02:07.347
Trust me.

02:08.156 --> 02:09.533
She knows what's at stake,

02:09.693 --> 02:10.824
and our secret is safe.

02:13.251 --> 02:14.316
So how did she take it,

02:14.996 --> 02:15.951
us being together?

02:15.990 --> 02:18.693
She was too preoccupied with
her move to even comment.

02:18.694 --> 02:19.654
I mean, it's ridiculous.

02:19.655 --> 02:21.326
She's got boxes and boxes of stuff,

02:21.327 --> 02:22.847
and apparently, all of it's important.

02:22.914 --> 02:24.594
Yeah, well, we all need our stuff, Castle.

02:24.595 --> 02:26.098
I've got boxes and boxes of it.

02:26.099 --> 02:27.089
It's comforting.

02:27.573 --> 02:28.667
It reminds me of my past.

02:29.102 --> 02:29.870
Your kinky past?

02:30.432 --> 02:31.548
I've got that box, too.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.968
Housekeeping found her this morning.

02:37.969 --> 02:40.416
Name's Wendy Dupree, 25 years of age,

02:40.528 --> 02:42.096
single gunshot to the chest

02:42.768 --> 02:44.094
from a 9 millimeter.

02:44.394 --> 02:46.153
Unfortunately, she died slowly.

02:46.436 --> 02:48.259
Yeah, long enough to write the word "lie."

02:48.894 --> 02:51.155
So our killer wasn't a pro.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.025
She wouldn't have been left breathing.

02:53.026 --> 02:55.636
A dying declaration, but what does it mean?

02:55.665 --> 02:57.146
Hey, that's your department.

02:58.327 --> 02:59.487
Well, did someone lie to her?

02:59.995 --> 03:01.981
Perhaps it's the killer's initials.

03:02.584 --> 03:04.056
Maybe a grammatical error.

03:04.057 --> 03:05.657
She should've written "lay."

03:06.485 --> 03:07.225
Yo, Beckett.

03:08.527 --> 03:09.396
Victim's wallet.

03:10.939 --> 03:12.355
She came a long way to get killed.

03:12.701 --> 03:13.600
She's a Philly girl.

03:14.541 --> 03:15.581
How long was she here for?

03:15.604 --> 03:17.933
Front desk says she checked
in yesterday afternoon alone.

03:18.020 --> 03:19.264
She wasn't alone.

03:19.392 --> 03:22.212
She brought 4,000 of her closest friends.

03:22.587 --> 03:24.867
That kind of cash, what's she
doing in a dump like this?

03:24.881 --> 03:27.321
All right, run financials. See
what you guys can find. Yeah.

03:27.563 --> 03:28.603
Castle, what do you think?

03:29.165 --> 03:31.114
I think, as much as I love a good mystery,

03:31.115 --> 03:33.266
she could've left a more helpful note.

03:33.374 --> 03:35.420
Here's a message that
needs no interpretation.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.280
"You think you can lie to me?"

03:37.281 --> 03:38.281
Ah. Maybe that's the lie.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.431
"Run all you want. I'm gonna
find you and make you pay."

03:41.432 --> 03:43.919
It's a 2-1-5 area code. That's Philly.

03:44.131 --> 03:45.491
Pull a warrant for the cell phone.

03:45.492 --> 03:46.852
I want to know who sent that text.

03:46.853 --> 03:48.608
Yeah, I sent it. You bet I did.

03:48.609 --> 03:50.729
Well, it sounds like you had
a big problem with her.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.850
Hell, yeah, I had a problem.

03:52.050 --> 03:54.250
Wendy's a waitress at my
place, Joel's Cheesesteaks...

03:54.251 --> 03:55.011
the best in Philly.

03:55.036 --> 03:57.226
"The best in Philly"?
That's a tad presumptuous.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.162
Well, it is.

03:58.494 --> 04:00.174
So yesterday I sent that fraul to the bank

04:00.175 --> 04:01.975
to make a deposit for
the restaurant, right?

04:01.976 --> 04:03.409
But does she make the drop?
No.

04:03.511 --> 04:06.416
She hightails it up here
with 4,000 of my dollars.

04:06.576 --> 04:07.696
That's a lot of cheesesteak.

04:07.697 --> 04:10.281
So you followed her to New
York to get your money back.

04:10.282 --> 04:12.079
Damn right. I tried to be nice.

04:12.171 --> 04:13.256
Finally, she calls me,

04:13.257 --> 04:15.254
and she's like,
"I'm sorry. It was an emergency.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.935
I'll pay you back double when I get back."

04:17.072 --> 04:19.296
Screw that. She stole from me.

04:19.434 --> 04:21.269
And for that, she deserved to die?

04:21.269 --> 04:22.079
Yeah.

04:23.750 --> 04:24.488
Wait. What?

04:29.892 --> 04:30.715
Oh, no.

04:32.389 --> 04:33.174
No.

04:34.812 --> 04:35.856
I didn't do this.

04:36.393 --> 04:37.640
Nah. I couldn't even find her.

04:37.802 --> 04:40.848
No, I-I just got off the
train from Philly, uh,

04:40.849 --> 04:42.724
an hour before you guys picked me up.

04:43.754 --> 04:46.380
So Amtrak confirms that Pratt
was ticketed yesterday,

04:46.381 --> 04:48.888
but they can't be sure
of what train he was on.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.311
So we're double-checking his alibi.

04:50.405 --> 04:52.318
Have them check on that cheesesteak, too.

04:52.319 --> 04:54.119
There's no way that it's
the best in Philly.

04:55.292 --> 04:56.653
Anyway, even if it was him,

04:56.654 --> 04:58.694
it doesn't explain Wendy's
mysterious emergency...

04:58.695 --> 04:59.617
the stolen cash,

04:59.899 --> 05:01.671
the sudden trip to New York City.

05:01.889 --> 05:03.482
Mm. Why she would write "lie."

05:04.331 --> 05:07.092
You don't write a dying message
in blood just for kicks.

05:07.093 --> 05:08.423
There had to be a reason.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.230
Are you out, too? Want some more?

05:11.231 --> 05:12.831
Yeah. Uh, you know what? I'll go get it.

05:14.674 --> 05:15.533
Thank you.

05:21.777 --> 05:23.165
Long island expressway.

05:24.234 --> 05:26.347
Literary institute of excellence.

05:26.898 --> 05:28.018
Love is everything.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.416
Oh, did I just say that?

05:30.649 --> 05:31.598
I'm getting soft.

05:36.699 --> 05:37.739
Detective Beckett's phone.

05:38.063 --> 05:38.839
Castle?

05:39.195 --> 05:41.035
You're not allowed to
answer Beckett's phone.

05:41.577 --> 05:42.370
Yes, I am.

05:42.650 --> 05:43.598
Since when?

05:43.980 --> 05:44.913
Since I...

05:45.825 --> 05:47.545
Can... is there something I can do for you?

05:47.815 --> 05:49.652
Yeah. Write this down.

05:50.303 --> 05:52.574
I've got a partial off the shell casing.

05:52.575 --> 05:53.977
No matches in the system

05:54.028 --> 05:55.310
or to Mr. Pratt,

05:55.442 --> 05:57.642
but I did find some trace D.N.A.

05:58.432 --> 05:59.472
Are you writing this down?

06:00.041 --> 06:01.433
Yes. Castle.

06:01.434 --> 06:02.300
Okay, hang on.

06:10.465 --> 06:11.228
What are you doing?

06:12.079 --> 06:14.267
Ooh. You are in trouble.

06:14.312 --> 06:15.158
I'm not in trouble.

06:15.681 --> 06:17.135
Lanie got a partial print.

06:17.136 --> 06:19.372
It is not a match for Pratt.
He is not our guy.

06:19.373 --> 06:21.449
Who said that you could answer my phone?

06:21.450 --> 06:23.739
And why are you going through my drawers?

06:23.833 --> 06:25.353
I was just looking for a pad of paper.

06:25.354 --> 06:27.362
Sure you were. Stay out
of my stuff, Castle.

06:27.466 --> 06:28.259
Your stuff?

06:29.402 --> 06:30.385
Need I remind you,

06:31.136 --> 06:33.066
I've already seen your stuff.

06:33.517 --> 06:36.401
Yeah, well, some of my
stuff is still private.

06:36.402 --> 06:38.033
Oh, I get it.

06:38.842 --> 06:40.952
An old boyfriend made that for you. No.

06:41.365 --> 06:43.684
Really? 'Cause it's totally cool.
I wouldn't be jealous.

06:44.421 --> 06:46.474
Okay, maybe a little bit jealous.

06:46.475 --> 06:47.715
Not an old boyfriend?
Mnh-mnh.

06:47.716 --> 06:48.916
You got it from a crime scene.

06:48.917 --> 06:49.911
That is a keepsake

06:50.338 --> 06:52.809
from the first murderer you ever collared.

06:53.559 --> 06:54.472
I told you, Castle,

06:55.888 --> 06:56.642
it's private.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.143
Maybe it's the actual murder victim

07:01.144 --> 07:02.781
from a stick man convention.

07:02.973 --> 07:03.638
Really?

07:03.878 --> 07:05.558
That's the best that you can come up with?

07:05.559 --> 07:07.056
Challenge accepted. So...

07:08.005 --> 07:09.005
Nothing in the financials

07:09.006 --> 07:11.597
explain why Wendy needed 4 grand in cash,

07:11.598 --> 07:14.131
but I might have figured out
what she was doing in town.

07:14.249 --> 07:16.854
She used her credit card for a cab ride

07:16.855 --> 07:18.964
to 8th and market yesterday.

07:18.989 --> 07:19.909
The day she was killed.

07:19.944 --> 07:22.064
I spoke with a cabbie. Wendy
took his business card.

07:22.065 --> 07:23.105
Said she was going to call

07:23.106 --> 07:24.910
to have him take her back there today.

07:25.562 --> 07:26.765
Bet we find our answer there.

07:30.848 --> 07:32.118
A self-storage warehouse?

07:32.798 --> 07:34.971
What's a girl from Philly
doing in a place like this?

07:36.069 --> 07:36.805
Oh, yeah, yeah.

07:36.806 --> 07:37.705
She was here.

07:38.130 --> 07:40.051
A lot less bloody when I saw her, though.

07:40.218 --> 07:41.675
She signed up for the auction.

07:42.335 --> 07:43.071
Auction?

07:43.098 --> 07:45.797
Every month we auction off
repossessed storage units.

07:45.962 --> 07:47.144
You know, from deadbeats

07:47.657 --> 07:48.973
that don't pay their bills.

07:49.282 --> 07:50.546
There's one going on right now.

07:50.889 --> 07:52.335
That's what the $4,000 was for.

07:52.336 --> 07:53.502
She was gonna bid on a unit.

07:53.631 --> 07:54.582
Which unit?

07:55.142 --> 07:55.905
Beats me.

07:56.141 --> 07:58.744
Could be any one of the
14 we got up for bid.

07:58.885 --> 08:01.906
So there's no way of telling
which one she was interested in?

08:01.913 --> 08:03.394
Actually, there is a way.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.883
We misinterpreted Wendy's message.

08:05.884 --> 08:06.901
It's not "lie."

08:06.908 --> 08:08.268
We were looking at it upside down.

08:08.269 --> 08:10.565
It's "3-1-7."
That's what she was trying to say.

08:11.418 --> 08:13.152
Is unit 317 up for auction?

08:13.280 --> 08:14.733
Oh, as a matter of fact, it is.

08:15.535 --> 08:17.830
Probably auctioning it off as we speak.

08:18.479 --> 08:20.119
Wendy was killed trying to buy that unit.

08:20.120 --> 08:21.240
If we let it get sold off...

08:21.241 --> 08:23.801
Then we'll lose our best shot at
finding out who the killer is.

08:35.474 --> 08:36.514
Okay, next up is unit 317.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.914
You have 60 seconds to look,
and then we start the bidding.

08:38.916 --> 08:41.436
All right, Ryan, so the owner of
the unit was a Johan Fleming.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.116
Can you run that?

08:42.344 --> 08:43.068
Okay, thanks.

08:43.650 --> 08:44.970
We need you to stop this auction.

08:45.248 --> 08:47.944
As much as I'd like to help,
I'd like my money more.

08:47.945 --> 08:50.772
So unless you got a warrant,
I don't have to stop Jack.

08:50.802 --> 08:52.055
Okay, 30 seconds.

08:52.629 --> 08:53.686
Castle, what do you see?

08:53.876 --> 08:55.342
Uh... not much.

08:55.527 --> 08:56.200
Just a...

08:57.190 --> 08:58.030
Just a bunch of junk.

08:58.306 --> 09:01.075
Yeah, well, the key to Wendy's
murder might be in that junk,

09:01.076 --> 09:02.350
and we're about to lose it.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.563
There's no way I can get a warrant in time.

09:05.205 --> 09:07.445
You may not have a warrant,
but I got something better.

09:07.446 --> 09:07.958
Checkbook.

09:08.043 --> 09:09.902
Auctions are cash only, hotshot.

09:10.809 --> 09:11.467
Oh, no.

09:12.074 --> 09:14.544
What are we gonna do? Is 2 grand enough?

09:14.737 --> 09:16.657
What are you doing with
2 grand in your pocket?

09:16.658 --> 09:17.698
I'm a best-selling author.

09:17.699 --> 09:19.139
Why wouldn't I have 2 grand in my pocket?

09:19.239 --> 09:20.602
All right. What do you want to give for it?

09:20.603 --> 09:21.617
Who'll start us out? $100 bid.

09:21.618 --> 09:23.093
Who's gonna go $100 one time? Right here.

09:31.166 --> 09:32.726
Right here. Who's going $400? One time.

09:32.727 --> 09:33.913
Pretty boy's back, and he's in for $400.

09:33.914 --> 09:35.174

09:41.641 --> 09:43.155

Frankie's got $900. Now
looking for a $1,000 bid.

09:45.157 --> 09:46.277
Who's going $1,000 one time?

09:46.278 --> 09:47.678
Do I hear $1,000 from anybody here?

09:47.679 --> 09:48.930
Go a $1,000 bid one time.

09:48.931 --> 09:51.101
$1,500. $1,500.

09:51.271 --> 09:52.262
Anybody gonna top that?

09:52.384 --> 09:54.576
Anybody anywhere? $1,500 going once.

09:54.626 --> 09:55.673
$1,500 going twice.

09:55.674 --> 09:56.847
$1,600.

09:57.158 --> 09:59.481
Sweet 16 gets in just under the wire.

09:59.488 --> 10:00.528
Now who's gonna go $1,700?

10:00.529 --> 10:02.584
Want to go $1,700 one time?
Want to go $1,700?

10:02.585 --> 10:04.425
Looking for a $1,700 bid.
Anybody for $1,700?

10:04.426 --> 10:05.266
I've only got $2,000.

10:07.133 --> 10:07.806

10:08.285 --> 10:08.981
Sign it.

10:10.284 --> 10:11.108
Now keep bidding.

10:12.658 --> 10:14.156
Hi. Hi.

10:14.157 --> 10:15.419
Big Percy, right?

10:15.842 --> 10:18.082
What would it take to get all
the cash you have on you?

10:18.094 --> 10:19.717
Depends on what you offering.

10:20.005 --> 10:21.282
How about a check?

10:22.072 --> 10:23.395
No, it's good. I swear.

10:23.396 --> 10:26.436
It's signed by the millionaire
mystery novelist Richard Castle.

10:26.437 --> 10:27.238
Yeah, right.

10:27.851 --> 10:29.322
No, really. He's right behind me.

10:29.722 --> 10:30.680
For real? Yeah.

10:31.437 --> 10:33.461
My moms loves his books. Yes. I'll do it.

10:33.462 --> 10:34.225
Okay.

10:34.451 --> 10:35.657
I'll give you $1,600.

10:36.130 --> 10:37.351
But it'll cost $2,500.

10:37.776 --> 10:39.253
$1,800. $2,300.

10:39.349 --> 10:41.509
2 grand, and he'll name a
character in his next novel

10:41.510 --> 10:42.451
after your mom. What?

10:42.664 --> 10:43.441
Sold.

10:43.922 --> 10:46.013
Here you go. Thanks.

10:47.519 --> 10:48.907
We got $3,600. Now make it work.

10:48.908 --> 10:51.308
Who'll go to 24 and a half?
Give me 24 and a half one time.

10:51.309 --> 10:52.429
Watch this. $2,500 one time.

10:52.678 --> 10:53.958
What do you say? Give me $2,500.

10:53.959 --> 10:54.999
Do I hear $2,500 anywhere?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.291
$3,000. $3,000...

10:56.292 --> 10:57.166
What are you doing?

10:57.225 --> 10:58.290
Trust me. I got this.

10:58.405 --> 10:59.221
Go $3,100 one time.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.272
I think he might buy it. Who'll go $3,100?

11:01.273 --> 11:02.724
$3,050.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.672
$3,050. Now you want to go $3,100?

11:04.673 --> 11:06.233
You go $3,100 one time? Let me hear it.

11:06.234 --> 11:08.194
You want to go $3,100 one time?
What do you say?

11:08.195 --> 11:08.475
$3,500.

11:08.476 --> 11:11.077
$3,500. Now you want to go $3,600?

11:11.183 --> 11:13.005
Castle, we've only got $3,600.

11:13.419 --> 11:14.819
Go 35 and a half. Go 35 and a half.

11:14.820 --> 11:16.300
You know what? I can do this all day.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.381
I'll outbid myself. $3,600.

11:17.382 --> 11:18.310
$3,600.

11:19.467 --> 11:20.574
Anybody gonna top that?

11:20.698 --> 11:22.678
Anybody where? $3,600 going once.

11:22.945 --> 11:25.429
$3,600 going twice. Bid now
or forever hold your peace.

11:25.891 --> 11:28.506
Sold right there to pretty boy for $3,600.

11:28.507 --> 11:29.707
Whoo-hoo! Thank you very much.

11:31.498 --> 11:33.178
How did you even know that was gonna work?

11:33.179 --> 11:34.499
Well, as a champion poker player,

11:34.500 --> 11:36.386
I am a student of body language.

11:36.387 --> 11:37.987
I could tell easily by looking at him...

11:37.988 --> 11:39.068
You had absolutely no idea.

11:39.069 --> 11:39.677
Not a clue.

11:40.179 --> 11:41.098
Congrats.

11:41.897 --> 11:43.250
All that junk is yours.

11:43.251 --> 11:44.126
Yeah, thanks.

11:44.262 --> 11:46.769
Oh, and, uh, my mother's name...

11:47.290 --> 11:48.168
Is Eunice.

11:48.937 --> 11:49.667
Excuse me.

11:52.238 --> 11:53.006
Eunice?

11:56.725 --> 11:58.565
Damn, bro. You actually
bought all this crap?

11:58.809 --> 12:01.649
All this crap is gonna
crack this case wide open.

12:02.193 --> 12:03.089
Thank you, L.T.

12:03.519 --> 12:05.555
You are so going to owe me for this.

12:05.838 --> 12:07.438
Castle, I don't know if the department's

12:07.439 --> 12:09.359
gonna be able to reimburse
you for all of this.

12:09.360 --> 12:10.601
That's not the owing I mean.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.147
Ran down the name on unit 317...

12:13.148 --> 12:14.421
Johan Fleming.

12:14.649 --> 12:16.529
Address is bogus. Name is bogus.

12:16.534 --> 12:17.846
The guy doesn't exist.

12:17.942 --> 12:19.171
Then whose stuff is this?

12:19.172 --> 12:20.772
Well, the answer's right in front of us.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.131
His stuff will tell us who he is.

12:23.164 --> 12:24.483
Look, there's a box of maps.

12:24.485 --> 12:26.920
Um, he was a geography buff.

12:26.987 --> 12:28.086
He enjoyed travel.

12:28.428 --> 12:29.469
Maybe he was a trucker.

12:29.470 --> 12:31.125
Ah. See? Progress.

12:31.204 --> 12:33.544
Ooh. Yo, climbing gear.

12:33.596 --> 12:34.621
He's an outdoorsman.

12:34.703 --> 12:36.503
A super creepy outdoorsman.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.186
Hey, this is high-end stuff, Castle.

12:39.387 --> 12:40.193
Can I have this?

12:40.829 --> 12:41.537
No.

12:41.610 --> 12:43.484
Why not? You're not a climber.

12:43.553 --> 12:45.033
I spent a lot of money on this stuff.

12:45.034 --> 12:46.514
You want something? Make me an offer.

12:47.715 --> 12:49.494
What the hell is going on here?

12:50.138 --> 12:51.039
Whose junk is this,

12:51.040 --> 12:53.000
and what in the hell is
it doing in my precinct?

12:53.179 --> 12:54.488
It's Castle's, sir.

12:55.252 --> 12:56.734
Mr. Castle.

12:56.805 --> 12:58.329
Uh, sir, actually,

12:58.395 --> 13:00.623
it's a part of an ongoing investigation.

13:00.817 --> 13:03.172
I don't care. I want it gone, all of it.

13:05.191 --> 13:06.085
Is that...

13:07.234 --> 13:09.182
Oh, it is.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.630
Do you know what you have?

13:11.819 --> 13:13.255
How rare that piece is?

13:13.565 --> 13:14.251
Sir?

13:14.867 --> 13:15.868
Are you a collector?

13:16.324 --> 13:17.651
Ever since I was a kid.

13:18.183 --> 13:19.653
I have searched...

13:19.859 --> 13:21.303
For years.

13:21.782 --> 13:22.674
Well...

13:23.298 --> 13:24.393
Search no more.

13:24.997 --> 13:26.253
No. Yes.

13:26.811 --> 13:27.753
It's yours.

13:27.991 --> 13:29.346
Really? Well, I...

13:29.347 --> 13:30.445
I don't know w... I...

13:30.446 --> 13:31.442
Say you'll accept.

13:31.813 --> 13:32.488
Oh.

13:34.016 --> 13:35.108
Thank you.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.310
Thank you very much.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.302
Uh... carry on.

13:48.169 --> 13:50.769
Oh, you can give her something,
but you can't give me something?

13:50.770 --> 13:51.810
Yeah, you already like me.

13:51.811 --> 13:52.731
Hey, guys. Mother lode.

13:53.608 --> 13:54.868
Tax returns.

13:54.977 --> 13:58.582
Looks like Johan Fleming's
actually Wendell Dupree.

13:58.583 --> 14:00.183
That's the same last name as our victim.

14:00.184 --> 14:02.981
Yes, and the same date of birth, too.
They must be twins.

14:03.298 --> 14:04.892
Wait. Twins.

14:05.361 --> 14:08.039
Of course. It all makes sense now.

14:08.183 --> 14:10.438
Wendell's secret identity...
Johan Fleming...

14:10.797 --> 14:13.665
is the same secret identity of Zan,

14:14.139 --> 14:15.435
the male half

14:15.746 --> 14:16.978
of the wonder twins.

14:19.603 --> 14:20.491
Wonder twins?

14:22.441 --> 14:23.379
The "super friends"?

14:24.644 --> 14:25.844
Seriously, you guys,

14:25.845 --> 14:26.962
do you not watch TV?

14:28.300 --> 14:29.911
If this unit belonged to her brother,

14:30.128 --> 14:31.487
then why was Wendy bidding on it?

14:31.535 --> 14:34.201
Why did he stop making payments?
And why was he using an alias?

14:34.611 --> 14:36.887
Why don't we track down
Wendell and ask him?

14:38.759 --> 14:39.861
Why don't you buy a TV?

14:42.746 --> 14:44.273
Who knew that gates had a softer side?

14:46.150 --> 14:47.488
Oh, God. Just beautiful.

14:47.733 --> 14:48.616
It's, um...

14:48.888 --> 14:51.350
Creepy, very, very... creepy.

14:52.879 --> 14:54.119
So where are we on the brother?

14:54.120 --> 14:56.823
Oh, it turns out the twins
had a hard knock life.

14:57.342 --> 14:59.335
Their parents died in a car crash

14:59.336 --> 15:00.278
when they were teens.

15:00.908 --> 15:02.828
It's like Wendell never
really fully recovered.

15:02.845 --> 15:05.501
He moved from town to town,
getting in scrapes with the law.

15:06.053 --> 15:07.053
So where can we find him?

15:07.054 --> 15:07.761
In an urn.

15:08.505 --> 15:10.483
He died six weeks ago.

15:10.634 --> 15:11.821
Hit by a subway train.

15:11.965 --> 15:12.625
Ouch.

15:13.041 --> 15:14.740
Explains why his storage bill wasn't paid.

15:15.653 --> 15:16.954
It says here it was an accident?

15:17.128 --> 15:19.135
Well, the subway cameras were broken,

15:19.149 --> 15:21.096
so there's really no way to know for sure.

15:21.380 --> 15:22.995
If his death is related to Wendy's,

15:22.996 --> 15:24.807
we could be looking at a second murder.

15:26.119 --> 15:29.248
Okay, so that was one of Wendy's
fellow waitresses from Philly.

15:29.249 --> 15:30.975
According to her, Wendy was convinced

15:30.976 --> 15:33.310
that her brother's death
wasn't an accident.

15:33.439 --> 15:35.519
Apparently, he was involved
in something dangerous.

15:35.520 --> 15:36.567
What kind of dangerous?

15:36.568 --> 15:38.568
Wendy didn't say, but
according to this waitress,

15:38.569 --> 15:40.929
just before the subway accident,
Wendell called his sister

15:40.930 --> 15:43.832
and said it was over and all
of their problems were solved.

15:44.140 --> 15:45.461
And yet, he ends up dead

15:45.462 --> 15:47.608
and she was desperate
enough to risk everything...

15:47.876 --> 15:48.779
her job, jail...

15:48.846 --> 15:50.646
just to go after her
brother's storage unit.

15:50.659 --> 15:51.394
Why?

15:51.580 --> 15:53.796
I mean, we've been through all this stuff.

15:53.797 --> 15:55.783
It just seems like a bunch of random junk.

15:55.942 --> 15:56.982
Well, maybe it's just that

15:56.983 --> 15:59.276
we don't know exactly
what we're looking for.

15:59.277 --> 16:01.118
I mean, whoever killed Wendy

16:01.119 --> 16:03.043
most likely came from Wendell's world.

16:03.044 --> 16:04.248
So what do we know about him?

16:04.249 --> 16:06.778
For the last three months,
using his wonder twin alias,

16:06.779 --> 16:10.776
Wendell worked as a chauffer
for one Angelica Henley,

16:10.948 --> 16:12.027
a wealthy socialite.

16:13.537 --> 16:14.244
Okay.

16:14.985 --> 16:15.865
Then let's start here.

16:22.379 --> 16:23.052
Good evening.

16:23.616 --> 16:24.415
May I help you?

16:25.239 --> 16:27.080
Uh, we were hoping to
speak with Ms. Henley.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.765
The lady in the purple cocktail dress.

16:30.026 --> 16:30.943
May I take you to her?

16:30.944 --> 16:32.584
Uh, you know what? I think we can manage.

16:32.740 --> 16:33.533
Champagne?

16:33.713 --> 16:34.604
I'm on duty.

16:34.705 --> 16:36.922
Ah, alas, I'm forced to drink alone.

16:38.071 --> 16:39.074
Angelica Henley.

16:40.099 --> 16:40.945
Anhelica.

16:41.702 --> 16:43.369
The "G" is silent.

16:43.684 --> 16:46.151
Wouldn't that make it Anelica?

16:46.389 --> 16:47.481
Anhelica.

16:47.719 --> 16:49.598
Well, I'm detective Kate Beckett,

16:49.599 --> 16:51.124
and this is Mr. Castle.

16:51.729 --> 16:52.640
Could we have a word?

16:53.072 --> 16:55.298
What's all this about? I have guests.

16:55.391 --> 16:58.873
Now I understand that you employed
a man named Johan Fleming.

16:58.912 --> 17:01.431
Yes, and I was so heartbroken
when the poor boy died.

17:01.434 --> 17:04.179
Well, were you aware that his
real name was Wendell Dupree?

17:04.651 --> 17:05.575
No, I wasn't.

17:06.012 --> 17:07.190
Did he have any enemies?

17:07.492 --> 17:09.012
No, I-I don't think so.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.561
Wait. You mean, his... his name was Wendell?

17:11.563 --> 17:12.459
Was he in trouble?

17:12.598 --> 17:15.122
Was he involved in any illegal activities.

17:15.123 --> 17:16.588
No, no, no. The police cleared him.

17:17.744 --> 17:18.512
Of what?

17:18.604 --> 17:21.336
Oh, well, two days before
he died, I was robbed.

17:21.337 --> 17:23.587
Somebody broke in here and
cracked my wall safe.

17:23.896 --> 17:24.792
What did they take?

17:25.029 --> 17:27.585
My bracelet made out of pink diamonds

17:27.586 --> 17:29.420
that was worth over $4 million.

17:29.538 --> 17:30.758
Wendell stole the bracelet.

17:30.924 --> 17:32.284
That's what's in the storage unit.

17:32.572 --> 17:33.582
That's why he was killed.

17:47.380 --> 17:48.574
What are you so happy about?

17:48.817 --> 17:51.830
There is a $4-million diamond bracelet

17:51.831 --> 17:53.514
buried in my auction winnings.

17:53.515 --> 17:54.303
I'm rich.

17:55.468 --> 17:56.237
Or richer.

17:56.679 --> 17:58.392
Till detective Beckett takes it from you

17:58.393 --> 18:00.066
and returns it to its rightful owner.

18:00.217 --> 18:02.311
Yes, but not even that can ruin my day

18:02.312 --> 18:03.091
because tonight

18:03.883 --> 18:04.906
is my very special

18:05.155 --> 18:07.348
last-night-before-college
dinner with my daughter.

18:08.315 --> 18:10.150
About that. Can we cancel?

18:10.231 --> 18:12.244
What? Whoa. What? Why?

18:12.772 --> 18:14.907
Alexis, we made these plans months ago.

18:14.908 --> 18:17.468
Do you know how hard it is, even
for me, to get reservations...

18:17.469 --> 18:19.429
If it's the reservations
you care so much about,

18:19.430 --> 18:21.030
why don't you just take your girlfriend?

18:22.151 --> 18:23.351
Hold on, Alexis. That's not...

18:23.745 --> 18:24.397
That's not...

18:27.855 --> 18:28.815
that's not what I meant.

18:29.097 --> 18:30.926
Alexis hates me?

18:31.781 --> 18:32.941
Is it because we're together?

18:33.410 --> 18:35.862
I guess she feels like
she's being replaced,

18:35.909 --> 18:36.469
which is weird

18:36.470 --> 18:38.030
because she's never done this before...

18:38.031 --> 18:38.591
not with Gina,

18:38.592 --> 18:40.792
not with the hundreds of
super-hot girlfriends I've...

18:40.793 --> 18:42.073
Okay, I don't need to hear this.

18:43.086 --> 18:43.903
Right.

18:46.664 --> 18:48.586
So do you think I should talk to her?

18:48.619 --> 18:50.315
No, no, no, no. No, she'll eat you alive.

18:50.316 --> 18:51.257
Let me handle it.

18:51.390 --> 18:52.183
Handle what?

18:52.554 --> 18:53.427
Nothing.

18:54.193 --> 18:56.393
So... uniforms are going
through Wendell's belongings,

18:56.394 --> 18:57.394
looking for the bracelet,

18:57.395 --> 18:59.953
but robbery finally sent over the report

18:59.954 --> 19:01.542
on the break-in on Angelica Henley's.

19:01.543 --> 19:02.488
Take a look at these.

19:02.717 --> 19:03.930
Wow. A real beauty.

19:04.307 --> 19:05.501
Certainly worth killing for.

19:05.580 --> 19:08.347
I am speaking of the bracelet
in case anyone is wondering.

19:08.590 --> 19:10.915
It was a 2-man job, pretty
sophisticated, too.

19:10.916 --> 19:13.835
One suspect put a bypass on
the alarm in the basement.

19:13.836 --> 19:15.156
The other rappelled from the roof

19:15.157 --> 19:16.397
and went in through the window.

19:16.465 --> 19:18.825
Which explains the climbing
equipment you had your eye on.

19:18.826 --> 19:22.272
So Wendell was suspiciously hit by a train

19:22.273 --> 19:24.049
after stealing a diamond bracelet,

19:24.050 --> 19:25.050
and then six weeks later,

19:25.051 --> 19:27.197
his sister goes looking
for his storage unit,

19:27.198 --> 19:28.350
and she ends up dead.

19:28.516 --> 19:30.785
What if it's a "No honor among
thieves" thing?

19:30.888 --> 19:32.170
You said it was a 2-man job.

19:32.349 --> 19:33.716
What if Wendell's partner decided

19:33.717 --> 19:35.879
that he wanted the bracelet for himself,

19:35.880 --> 19:36.760
only he killed Wendell

19:36.761 --> 19:38.561
before he figured out
where he'd stashed it?

19:38.562 --> 19:40.898
So he follows Wendy, she leads
him to the storage unit,

19:40.899 --> 19:41.807
and then he kills her.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.291
Find the partner, find the killer.

19:43.381 --> 19:44.701
Well, maybe we already found him.

19:45.118 --> 19:45.813
What do you mean?

19:46.173 --> 19:47.733
Castle, do you remember at the auction,

19:47.734 --> 19:50.321
all of the bidders dropped
out after $1,500?

19:50.465 --> 19:51.373
Except one.

19:51.374 --> 19:52.774
He knew what was inside.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.441
Why else would he bid so high?

19:55.599 --> 19:57.622
Felix Gozarian, NYPD.

19:57.623 --> 19:58.461
Open up.

19:59.473 --> 20:00.705
Just a second!

20:04.156 --> 20:05.156
He's making a run for it.

20:05.157 --> 20:07.684
Yeah. Go. NYPD!

20:07.899 --> 20:08.623
NYPD!

20:12.538 --> 20:13.341
Don't move.

20:13.356 --> 20:14.150
Drop it.

20:17.399 --> 20:19.519
I thought you were thieves
trying to steal my stuff.

20:19.714 --> 20:22.845
I had absolutely no idea what
was in the storage unit. It's...

20:22.846 --> 20:24.694
Yet, unlike anyone else there,

20:24.695 --> 20:26.356
you bid us through the roof.

20:27.058 --> 20:29.853
Lady, that's strategy. I-I
bid on a lot of things.

20:29.854 --> 20:30.954
That's how I make my money.

20:31.130 --> 20:34.003
So you actually... sell this stuff?

20:34.406 --> 20:35.198
Not yet.

20:35.884 --> 20:38.059
I'm still organizing, cataloging.

20:38.208 --> 20:39.752
There's a method to all of this...

20:39.753 --> 20:42.224
you know, what I collect, what I bid on.

20:42.555 --> 20:44.615
Especially when you got inside information.

20:44.987 --> 20:47.328
You knew exactly what was in that unit.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.366
No, I didn't.

20:52.741 --> 20:54.431
Yeah, you know, I was thinking,

20:54.432 --> 20:57.067
when I signed up for the auction,

20:57.290 --> 20:58.301
there was a guy.

20:58.647 --> 21:02.279
Yeah, offered me $500 to be his proxy,

21:02.309 --> 21:04.056
get unit 317.

21:04.081 --> 21:05.760
Very specific. 317.

21:05.761 --> 21:06.761
And what did you say?

21:07.836 --> 21:08.928
I said no.

21:09.073 --> 21:11.500
$500? I'm not in for the short money.

21:12.122 --> 21:13.205
It made me curious.

21:13.320 --> 21:14.832
317. Why?

21:15.692 --> 21:17.132
That was probably Wendell's partner.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.224
And was he at the auction?

21:19.279 --> 21:21.503
No. No, no, no, no. I never saw him again.

21:22.306 --> 21:24.393
We're gonna need you to
sit with a sketch artist.

21:25.330 --> 21:27.140
So Felix alibied out.

21:27.648 --> 21:28.425
But...

21:29.547 --> 21:30.453
Who's that?

21:31.588 --> 21:32.652
Wendell's partner.

21:32.874 --> 21:34.879
Ryan and Esposito are trying to I.D.
him now.

21:35.239 --> 21:35.913
How about you?

21:36.555 --> 21:38.002
I have ripped through

21:38.038 --> 21:40.681
everything in this room big
enough to hide a bracelet.

21:40.682 --> 21:41.562
You know what I found?

21:41.563 --> 21:43.346
Nothing? Absolutely nothing.

21:43.347 --> 21:45.658
Save for these wicked nunchakus,

21:45.659 --> 21:48.220
which is how I broke the hot dog maker.

21:48.414 --> 21:51.444
Also some notable books...
Slovakian polka music,

21:51.454 --> 21:53.588
prosthetic eye manufacturing,
and my favorite,

21:53.589 --> 21:55.141
a "History of Irish Travelers."

21:56.393 --> 21:57.278
I don't get it.

21:57.349 --> 21:59.461
All of the evidence, Wendy's murder...

21:59.462 --> 22:00.913
everything points to the fact that

22:00.914 --> 22:02.577
that bracelet should be in there.

22:02.592 --> 22:03.494
Well, it's not.

22:03.814 --> 22:05.519
I did, however, make some headway

22:05.520 --> 22:07.133
on my little stick man theory.

22:08.109 --> 22:08.648
Really?

22:08.649 --> 22:10.880
Yes. Whilst you were still an officer,

22:10.881 --> 22:12.903
you risked your life running into traffic

22:12.904 --> 22:14.378
to save an old gypsy woman.

22:14.379 --> 22:15.273
A gypsy woman?

22:15.283 --> 22:17.135
An old gypsy woman.

22:17.171 --> 22:18.764
To reward your bravery,

22:18.765 --> 22:20.223
she gave you a talisman.

22:20.359 --> 22:22.105
Mm-hmm. She said, as long as you keep it.

22:23.212 --> 22:24.598
No harm will ever befall you.

22:25.127 --> 22:26.681
No harm will ever befall me?

22:28.179 --> 22:29.273
You look all right to me.

22:29.353 --> 22:31.283
So, Mr. Castle,

22:32.044 --> 22:33.974
I decided to give "Frozen Heat" a read,

22:33.975 --> 22:34.838
and you know what?

22:35.650 --> 22:37.682
It's really a good book.

22:38.427 --> 22:39.255
You liked it?

22:39.382 --> 22:40.279
I loved it.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.377
I, uh, do you mind? No.

22:42.378 --> 22:44.959
I-I ordered the rest of
the Nikki Heat series.

22:46.419 --> 22:47.995
And, again, thank you

22:47.996 --> 22:49.569
for my Gemini collectible.

22:50.188 --> 22:52.291
I now have a complete set.

22:55.707 --> 22:56.444
You see that?

22:56.481 --> 22:57.434
She loves me now,

22:57.968 --> 23:00.624
and I've got that scary little
monstrosity to thank for it.

23:00.676 --> 23:02.401
Hey, guys. You need to see this.

23:03.020 --> 23:06.807
So robbery interviewed a guy
named Marco Vinstrolli.

23:07.601 --> 23:09.695
His van got a parking
ticket around the corner

23:09.696 --> 23:11.646
the night that Angelica's
bracelet was stolen.

23:11.785 --> 23:13.976
Now they found nothing
to connect him, but...

23:16.867 --> 23:17.646
Look familiar?

23:18.049 --> 23:19.010
That's our guy.

23:19.338 --> 23:21.601
The storage manager said
that he rented Marco a unit

23:21.602 --> 23:23.652
on the same floor the
day before the auction.

23:23.742 --> 23:25.437
So I-I reviewed their surveillance tapes.

23:25.593 --> 23:27.869
This is from 6:00 A.M. yesterday morning.

23:28.039 --> 23:29.239
Five hours before the auction.

23:30.512 --> 23:31.892
He broke into my storage unit.

23:32.645 --> 23:35.403
Well, it's... it was Wendell's at the time,

23:35.404 --> 23:36.448
but now it's mine.

23:37.591 --> 23:38.479
Is that a safe?

23:39.249 --> 23:40.929
That's why we couldn't find your bracelet.

23:40.930 --> 23:42.010
Because it was in the safe.

23:42.011 --> 23:42.816
My safe.

23:43.379 --> 23:44.898
So do we have a license on that van?

23:52.520 --> 23:54.800
Put it down, dirtbag! NYPD,
put up your hands right now!

23:54.801 --> 23:56.610
Take your hand off your tool, Marco.

24:00.333 --> 24:01.099
Shut up.

24:06.777 --> 24:08.991
Marco, we know that you and
Wendell were partners.

24:08.992 --> 24:11.674
Your van was ticketed when
you guys pulled the job.

24:11.906 --> 24:13.226
Robbery couldn't prove it before,

24:13.227 --> 24:15.050
but now with these, well, we got you.

24:15.590 --> 24:18.251
Well, it seems to me like
all you've got me for

24:18.332 --> 24:19.480
is stealing a safe.

24:20.308 --> 24:23.258
What's the punishment for that, 30 days?

24:23.503 --> 24:24.737
More like 30 years

24:24.982 --> 24:28.425
after we add Wendell and
Wendy's murders to it.

24:28.458 --> 24:29.140
Murder?

24:30.375 --> 24:32.175
Why don't you tell us
exactly what happened,

24:32.176 --> 24:33.816
and we'll get the D.A. to cut you a deal?

24:33.817 --> 24:34.644
But you better hurry,

24:34.645 --> 24:36.325
because they're cutting through that safe,

24:36.326 --> 24:37.966
and when they find that diamond bracelet,

24:37.967 --> 24:38.727
you're on your own.

24:41.303 --> 24:42.878
You know what I love about this case?

24:43.366 --> 24:44.083
What's that?

24:44.497 --> 24:47.365
Finding a pretty pink bracelet

24:47.366 --> 24:48.249
in my belongings.

24:49.417 --> 24:51.177
You know you're gonna have to return that...

24:51.178 --> 24:51.698
I know, Ryan.

24:51.699 --> 24:52.207
I know that.

24:53.161 --> 24:54.721
Can't you just let me have this moment,

24:54.722 --> 24:56.806
this one small, "Treasure Island,"

24:56.807 --> 24:58.564
Indiana Jones moment?

24:59.013 --> 25:00.137
Sorry. You got it.

25:00.138 --> 25:01.618
Well, it's too late now. It's ruined.

25:02.784 --> 25:04.114
All I did

25:04.115 --> 25:07.204
was help him break in to that penthouse.

25:07.205 --> 25:08.401
I swear to God,

25:08.402 --> 25:10.364
I didn't even know the guy.

25:10.789 --> 25:12.925
Johan or Wendell,

25:13.015 --> 25:15.105
whatever, paid me 5 grand

25:15.106 --> 25:18.081
to kill the alarms, no questions asked.

25:18.107 --> 25:20.532
We did the job, he came out happy,

25:20.622 --> 25:23.496
said "Mission accomplished,"
we went separate ways.

25:23.497 --> 25:25.093
Except you still wanted the bracelet.

25:25.683 --> 25:28.028
So you went after him and you killed him.

25:28.798 --> 25:31.454
I didn't even know that he
took that damn bracelet

25:31.455 --> 25:33.632
until I read about it in the papers.

25:33.633 --> 25:34.953
And by that time,

25:35.052 --> 25:36.502
he was already dead.

25:36.503 --> 25:38.241
So I broke into Wendell's,

25:38.242 --> 25:42.154
but all I found was a key,
marked "Storage unit."

25:43.375 --> 25:45.335
And you didn't know where
that storage unit was.

25:45.336 --> 25:47.754
So I kept a close eye on upcoming auctions

25:47.755 --> 25:50.068
until I found one with Johan's name.

25:50.196 --> 25:53.579
As soon as I saw the safe inside, I knew...

25:53.932 --> 25:56.092
That's where he had stashed
that diamond bracelet.

26:00.056 --> 26:01.479
Oh, I love this part...

26:02.105 --> 26:03.656
the kick of adrenaline,

26:03.886 --> 26:05.084
the quickening of the heart,

26:05.085 --> 26:07.996
those last few drops of anticipation.

26:09.517 --> 26:10.670
It's empty.

26:11.471 --> 26:13.227
So where is the bracelet?

26:13.228 --> 26:15.565
Wherever it is, it's laughing at me.

26:15.695 --> 26:16.775
Maybe Marco was wrong,

26:16.776 --> 26:18.416
and Wendell sold it before he was killed.

26:18.417 --> 26:20.137
Well, then where's the money from the sale?

26:20.138 --> 26:21.818
No money means there should be a bracelet.

26:21.819 --> 26:23.419
No bracelet means there should be money.

26:23.420 --> 26:25.860
I think the question we should
be asking is, how did Wendell

26:25.861 --> 26:28.204
even pull off a heist
like this to begin with?

26:28.923 --> 26:30.083
Angelica said

26:30.084 --> 26:31.564
that the thief cracked the wall safe.

26:31.565 --> 26:33.684
Do you know how hard it
is to crack a wall safe?

26:33.685 --> 26:35.325
Especially since Wendell didn't even have

26:35.326 --> 26:37.726
any of the proper equipment
in his storage unit. It just...

26:37.727 --> 26:38.647
Doesn't make any sense?

26:38.648 --> 26:39.735
Thank you.

26:40.171 --> 26:42.475
Unless Angelica wasn't
telling us the truth.

26:47.782 --> 26:48.902
Listen to this...

26:49.041 --> 26:51.912
Angelica was scheduled for a bankruptcy
hearing a week ago,

26:51.913 --> 26:54.233
but it was canceled because
she made a $2-million payment

26:54.234 --> 26:55.169
to herreditors.

26:55.170 --> 26:56.770
That's right after the insurance company

26:56.771 --> 26:58.526
paid her claim on the bracelet.

26:58.527 --> 26:59.703
What if this whole thing

26:59.704 --> 27:02.232
was a ploy to commit insurance fraud?

27:02.233 --> 27:03.663
"Mission accomplished."

27:04.011 --> 27:06.221
That's what Wendell said
after the break-in.

27:06.222 --> 27:07.963
"Mission accomplished."

27:07.964 --> 27:10.443
Right. He didn't say he
actually stole anything.

27:10.444 --> 27:12.581
The mission was to make
it look like a robbery.

27:12.582 --> 27:14.298
And the best way to make it look real,

27:14.299 --> 27:16.558
to fool the police and
the insurance company...

27:16.559 --> 27:19.162
Is to actually break in yet steal nothing.

27:19.163 --> 27:20.839
Angelica set this whole thing up.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.800
And the only other person
that knew was Wendell.

27:23.096 --> 27:25.150
She couldn't afford to
let him or his sister

27:25.151 --> 27:26.555
expose her secret.

27:26.556 --> 27:28.082
I call that motive for murder

27:28.083 --> 27:30.556
and probable cause for a search warrant.

27:38.903 --> 27:39.631
Good work.

27:39.632 --> 27:40.569
Thank you.

27:44.734 --> 27:46.454
I'm sorry, Ms. Henley. They just barged in.

27:46.455 --> 27:47.295
I tried to stop them.

27:47.296 --> 27:50.168
You people have no grounds
to search my residence.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.344
Actually... we do.

27:52.345 --> 27:53.417
This is outrageous.

27:53.418 --> 27:55.232
She's right. This is outrageous.

27:55.233 --> 27:56.545
You know what you should do?

27:57.151 --> 27:59.263
Open that wall safe and prove us wrong.

28:00.669 --> 28:02.949
Fine. We can just tear it out
of the wall if you'd like.

28:02.950 --> 28:05.090
No, no, no, no, no, no.

28:23.194 --> 28:24.181
Well, is it there?

28:28.087 --> 28:29.607
Hello, gorgeous.

28:34.551 --> 28:37.598
This little beauty has caused
a lot of trouble, hasn't it?

28:37.786 --> 28:40.553
That's what beautiful things do, my dear,

28:41.542 --> 28:42.767
at least to me.

28:42.861 --> 28:44.630
So why didn't you just sell it

28:44.631 --> 28:45.969
and solve all your money problems

28:45.970 --> 28:49.117
instead of hiring Wendell
to stage a robbery?

28:49.118 --> 28:50.650
I didn't hire Wendell.

28:50.651 --> 28:52.651
I didn't even know he was
involved in all of this

28:52.652 --> 28:53.372
until you told me.

28:53.373 --> 28:56.543
So the fact that he broke in
the same night that you called

28:56.544 --> 28:57.929
and reported this stolen,

28:57.930 --> 28:59.640
that's just a coincidence?

28:59.641 --> 29:02.161
Look, when I came home

29:02.434 --> 29:04.461
and saw that my apartment
had been burglarized,

29:04.462 --> 29:07.525
I was... I was panicked, shocked.

29:08.348 --> 29:10.260
Until I saw that nothing had been taken.

29:10.769 --> 29:12.264
So I thought that if I

29:12.265 --> 29:15.218
simply pretended that my
bracelet had been stolen,

29:17.420 --> 29:18.973
it would solve all my problems.

29:18.974 --> 29:21.378
Except you created two new problems...

29:21.379 --> 29:23.224
your chauffer and his sister...

29:23.225 --> 29:25.418
both of whom are now dead.

29:26.082 --> 29:28.721
I think it's time for
me to call my attorney.

29:29.364 --> 29:31.189
So she admitted to insurance fraud

29:31.190 --> 29:33.254
hoping to avoid murder charges.

29:33.255 --> 29:34.762
At least I think that's her play.

29:34.763 --> 29:36.363
You think? Yeah, she's a desperate woman

29:36.364 --> 29:38.078
on the verge of losing her wealth.

29:38.079 --> 29:40.007
That's death to someone like her.

29:40.008 --> 29:42.820
She's probably willing to
do anything to avoid it...

29:42.821 --> 29:44.662
lie, steal, cheat,

29:44.663 --> 29:46.725
and in this case, kill.

29:46.726 --> 29:49.006
Yeah, but that still doesn't
explain the storage locker.

29:49.007 --> 29:50.821
I mean, if Wendell didn't steal anything,

29:51.097 --> 29:52.097
what did he put in there

29:52.098 --> 29:54.206
that his sister was so desperate to get?

29:54.444 --> 29:56.604
And if it didn't have anything
to do with her murder,

29:56.605 --> 29:58.685
why would she write the
locker number in her blood?

29:58.686 --> 30:00.366
Castle, you went through that storage unit

30:00.367 --> 30:01.750
with a fine-tooth comb.

30:01.751 --> 30:03.711
You said that there's
nothing of value in there.

30:03.712 --> 30:05.218
Well, yeah, nothing of value to us.

30:06.193 --> 30:08.349
But I mean, what about
something of value to them?

30:08.630 --> 30:09.643
Like what?

30:09.644 --> 30:11.357
I don't know... a trinket,

30:11.358 --> 30:12.412
an heirloom.

30:14.219 --> 30:16.299
The answer's in there somewhere.
It has to be.

30:16.734 --> 30:18.516
Anyway... it's getting late.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.108
I have to drop off Alexis
first thing in the morning.

30:21.148 --> 30:22.884
Fresh start tomorrow? Sure.

30:22.952 --> 30:23.961
Walk you out?

30:24.059 --> 30:25.819
Uh, you know what?
I've gotta stick around.

30:25.820 --> 30:27.220
I have to go over Angelica's alibi.

30:27.221 --> 30:27.890
All right.

30:31.541 --> 30:33.389
I so wish I could kiss you right now.

30:33.743 --> 30:34.775
Yeah, I know.

30:45.078 --> 30:46.069
This is me...

30:46.764 --> 30:48.881
Softly touching your face,

30:48.882 --> 30:52.058
pulling you in for a long, slow kiss.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.568
And this is me kissing you back,

30:56.787 --> 30:58.555
running my hands through your hair.

31:02.556 --> 31:03.995
Best handshake ever.

31:04.638 --> 31:05.670
Yeah.

31:09.181 --> 31:10.861
I think my hand's getting a little sweaty.

31:10.862 --> 31:11.862
I know. It's kinda gross.

31:11.863 --> 31:13.046
Sorry. No worries.

31:26.243 --> 31:27.237
Oh, Alexis.

31:27.238 --> 31:29.558
My darling, farewell.

31:29.736 --> 31:31.534
God knows when we shall meet again.

31:32.542 --> 31:33.702
That's Shakespeare, you know?

31:33.703 --> 31:34.277
I know.

31:34.278 --> 31:36.143
All right, no farewells, no good-byes.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.557
Just see ya later, kiddo.

31:38.558 --> 31:39.821
See you later, gram.

31:40.026 --> 31:41.211
I'll be in the hall, darling.

31:41.212 --> 31:42.260
All right.

31:46.339 --> 31:47.587
So...

31:48.660 --> 31:50.372
This is your new home, huh?

31:56.010 --> 31:58.402
Hey, look, I get it.

31:58.597 --> 31:59.637
I do.

31:59.859 --> 32:02.963
But whatever happens
between Beckett and me,

32:02.964 --> 32:05.284
I want you to know... I mean,
we could break up tomorrow,

32:05.285 --> 32:07.245
we could spend the rest
of our lives together...

32:07.246 --> 32:10.350
but she will never take
your place in my heart.

32:10.911 --> 32:11.844
Why would I be worried

32:11.845 --> 32:14.078
about detective Beckett replacing me?

32:16.092 --> 32:17.171
Uh, well...

32:17.872 --> 32:19.249
You were act... I thought...

32:19.250 --> 32:20.425
How can you be so smart

32:20.426 --> 32:22.658
and so clueless at the same time?

32:22.900 --> 32:23.852
Practice.

32:24.908 --> 32:26.245
This is no more about Beckett

32:26.246 --> 32:28.244
than it's about the fact
my mother isn't here.

32:28.245 --> 32:29.565
Sorry, honey, but your mom... no.

32:29.566 --> 32:31.007
She's in...
No, it's fine.

32:31.008 --> 32:32.833
It's always been fine,

32:33.593 --> 32:34.857
because no matter what,

32:35.303 --> 32:37.144
I'd wake up, and you'd be there,

32:38.653 --> 32:40.192
and I'd know that everything's fine.

32:40.193 --> 32:42.079
Oh, and when you wake up here...

32:42.757 --> 32:43.861
Then I'm here.

32:44.786 --> 32:46.059
And you're there.

32:46.460 --> 32:48.820
Even though there is only 5 miles away...

32:51.444 --> 32:52.676
It's not here.

32:55.477 --> 32:58.117
Well, everything is going to be fine.

32:59.133 --> 33:00.725
And you are gonna be fine.

33:02.047 --> 33:04.534
And though I am there,

33:05.309 --> 33:07.021
if you need me here,

33:07.502 --> 33:08.767
here is where I'll be.

33:14.588 --> 33:15.700
Hey, dad.

33:17.144 --> 33:20.266
I-I know it's been a while, but, um...

33:21.912 --> 33:23.104
Could you do it...

33:24.392 --> 33:25.600
One last time?

33:42.216 --> 33:43.384
No monsters.

33:44.485 --> 33:45.525
You sure?

33:46.893 --> 33:49.021
Yeah, and if there are, I'll come running.

34:10.657 --> 34:12.077
Darling, are you crying?

34:12.078 --> 34:13.326
No, it's allergies.

34:13.428 --> 34:14.739
The pollen count is high.

34:14.926 --> 34:16.425
The pollen count's gotten to me, too.

34:16.426 --> 34:17.817
Right?
I know.

34:26.851 --> 34:28.291
You can get home by yourself, right?

34:28.292 --> 34:30.208
Well, I... thanks. Love you, mother.

34:33.022 --> 34:34.174
I know where it is.

34:34.181 --> 34:34.933
Where what is?

34:34.934 --> 34:36.614
I don't know what it is, only where it is.

34:36.614 --> 34:38.748
Whatever Wendell stole
was only of value to him

34:38.748 --> 34:40.676
and his twin sister.

34:40.695 --> 34:42.808
So he would hide it in the one place

34:42.809 --> 34:44.308
only she would look.

34:44.309 --> 34:47.036
Wendy, Wendell, twins...

34:47.038 --> 34:50.355
as in Gemini collectibles.

34:50.356 --> 34:51.493
This is it.

34:51.494 --> 34:52.581
Castle!

34:55.355 --> 34:56.333
It's empty.

34:56.335 --> 34:57.879
Oh, that can't be right.

34:59.902 --> 35:01.332
What... oh, sir, just breathe.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.391
What the hell have you done?

35:03.392 --> 35:04.175
I thought...

35:04.176 --> 35:06.120
Y-you thought what, Mr. Castle?

35:06.121 --> 35:08.497
I just thought that Wendell
would've hidden what he stole

35:08.498 --> 35:10.988
inside the Gemini...
It wasn't Wendell's. It was mine!

35:10.989 --> 35:12.928
I brought it in from home this morning!

35:12.929 --> 35:14.225
All right, that's my bad.

35:16.050 --> 35:17.259
Wait. That means...

35:17.961 --> 35:18.737
Ah. Here it is.

35:18.738 --> 35:20.194
D-d-d... no!

35:22.711 --> 35:24.887
A U.S.B. drive and a glass eye.

35:26.934 --> 35:28.214
I didn't see that coming.

35:37.993 --> 35:40.784
Okay, so the photos from this U.S.B. drive

35:40.785 --> 35:42.633
are from a crime scene.

35:43.271 --> 35:44.446
A crime scene where?

35:44.447 --> 35:45.803
Mercer, Pennsylvania.

35:45.804 --> 35:48.859
They're about a decade old.
It was a hit-and-run.

35:49.142 --> 35:51.244
What does any of this have
to do with a glass eye?

35:51.351 --> 35:52.391
Weren't the twins' parents

35:52.392 --> 35:53.981
killed in a car crash ten years ago?

35:53.982 --> 35:55.819
Yeah, they were rear-ended,

35:55.820 --> 35:58.480
and their car went down an embankment.

35:58.593 --> 36:01.177
Report said that they were
trapped inside and bled out,

36:01.178 --> 36:03.298
and that if the person who
hit them would've stopped

36:03.299 --> 36:05.019
and called for help, they might have lived.

36:05.020 --> 36:06.220
Hey, guys. Look at this photo.

36:06.221 --> 36:09.552
It's from the crime scene, and
it's of a broken glass eye.

36:09.841 --> 36:10.889
What?

36:11.484 --> 36:12.663
A glass eye?

36:12.664 --> 36:13.879
Wait a minute.

36:16.322 --> 36:18.458
Of course. It all makes sense now.

36:18.712 --> 36:19.646
It does?

36:19.647 --> 36:21.107
Wendell's obsession...

36:21.108 --> 36:22.545
why he moved from place to place,

36:22.546 --> 36:24.506
why he came to New York,
why he used a fake name

36:24.507 --> 36:26.226
and a had a book on prosthetic eyes.

36:26.227 --> 36:28.092
He was... he was on a mission.

36:28.093 --> 36:29.453
Yeah, but on a mission to do what?

36:29.454 --> 36:31.894
Well, to find the person responsible
for his parents' death.

36:31.895 --> 36:32.695
In order to be sure,

36:32.696 --> 36:35.888
Wendell had to steal the
suspect's glass eye.

36:36.017 --> 36:37.310
That's what the heist was about.

36:37.311 --> 36:39.831
And like fingerprints, he used
that photo to compare the eyes.

36:39.832 --> 36:40.975
A la Richard Kimble,

36:40.976 --> 36:43.265
but instead of looking
for a one-armed man...

36:43.266 --> 36:45.578
He was looking for a one-eyed man.

36:45.986 --> 36:48.725
Or in our case, a one-eyed woman.

36:48.726 --> 36:51.303
I'm not saying a word without my lawyer.

36:51.304 --> 36:53.264
You don't have to, but you
might want to listen.

36:53.265 --> 36:54.634
We know what Wendell stole.

36:54.635 --> 36:56.938
That's it. I'm calling my attorney.

36:57.766 --> 36:58.529
Uh, may I?

36:58.530 --> 36:59.730
Yes. Thank you.

36:59.967 --> 37:02.524
I've worked a lot of murder cases,

37:02.525 --> 37:04.389
waiting patiently for the day

37:04.390 --> 37:06.238
I could unequivocally exclaim,

37:06.992 --> 37:08.463
the butler did it.

37:08.890 --> 37:09.858
What?

37:09.859 --> 37:11.419
Must have been a shock...

37:11.420 --> 37:13.063
all these years later,

37:13.064 --> 37:14.424
after you put all that behind you,

37:14.425 --> 37:16.826
to have someone walk into your life

37:16.827 --> 37:18.435
and stir it all back up again.

37:18.639 --> 37:19.784
Kirby.

37:19.964 --> 37:21.294
What's he talking about?

37:21.295 --> 37:23.781
Your live-in butler caused a car accident

37:23.782 --> 37:25.360
and then fled the scene.

37:25.603 --> 37:27.611
Because he did, two
people lost their lives.

37:27.612 --> 37:29.876
And those people were Wendell's parents.

37:30.235 --> 37:31.452
That is...

37:31.459 --> 37:33.346
Absolutely ridiculous.

37:33.815 --> 37:35.424
You can't prove any of it.

37:35.425 --> 37:37.200
Your D.N.A. was on the prosthetic eye

37:37.201 --> 37:38.753
that Wendell stole.

37:38.812 --> 37:40.154
And it's a match to the D.N.A.

37:40.155 --> 37:42.680
found on the shell casing
in Wendy's hotel room.

37:43.360 --> 37:44.424
It's all over.

37:52.987 --> 37:54.171
I worked...

37:54.703 --> 37:56.935
So hard to put that night...

37:56.936 --> 37:58.700
that horrible night... behind me.

37:58.701 --> 38:00.046
And then the break-in.

38:01.161 --> 38:02.817
Of all the things to steal,

38:03.086 --> 38:05.318
my spare eye from off my bureau.

38:06.324 --> 38:07.868
That's when I put it all together...

38:08.579 --> 38:11.564
who the new chauffer truly was

38:13.022 --> 38:14.502
and what he was trying to prove.

38:16.186 --> 38:18.026
But you... you have to understand...

38:18.941 --> 38:21.477
I couldn't bring their parents back.

38:22.496 --> 38:23.712
I-I couldn't.

38:24.144 --> 38:25.543
Why should I suffer?

38:27.298 --> 38:28.683
Kirby Smith, you're under arrest

38:28.684 --> 38:30.282
for the murders of Wendell

38:30.320 --> 38:31.744
and Wendy Dupree.

38:32.161 --> 38:34.417
And I am sure that the
state of Pennsylvania

38:34.418 --> 38:36.050
will be adding two counts

38:36.294 --> 38:38.310
of vehicular manslaughter to that.

38:39.826 --> 38:41.293
Kirby made a full confession.

38:41.294 --> 38:43.541
He read an article about a recent mugging

38:43.542 --> 38:44.657
in the subway station,

38:44.658 --> 38:46.176
and decided to kill Wendell there

38:46.177 --> 38:48.337
because he knew that the
cameras wouldn't be working.

38:48.338 --> 38:50.318
But the evidence that Wendell stole

38:50.319 --> 38:52.699
was still out there, so
was his sister Wendy.

38:52.700 --> 38:54.580
When she started poking
around storage spaces,

38:54.581 --> 38:56.469
Kirby tracked her to the
hotel and shot her.

38:56.899 --> 38:58.531
Worthless bastard.

38:59.030 --> 39:00.167
I'm sorry.

39:00.178 --> 39:01.794
He took out their whole family.

39:02.816 --> 39:04.047
Good job, detective.

39:04.048 --> 39:05.136
Thank you.

39:13.210 --> 39:15.055
And... she hates me again.

39:15.056 --> 39:17.558
Yeah, well, those Gemini dolls
obviously meant a lot to her.

39:17.559 --> 39:18.919
Yeah, I wonder what that story is.

39:18.920 --> 39:20.371
I wonder what those stories are.

39:20.372 --> 39:22.532
What are you gonna do with
all of that stuff, Castle?

39:22.533 --> 39:24.650
Well, I'll give the climbing
equipment to Javier,

39:24.651 --> 39:25.693
and then, uh,

39:25.903 --> 39:27.624
donate the rest, I guess.

39:28.004 --> 39:30.613
It served its purpose. Brought
justice to his family.

39:30.614 --> 39:33.517
But it just goes to show you
that everyone and everything

39:33.518 --> 39:34.383
has a story,

39:34.384 --> 39:36.392
including your little stick man there.

39:39.262 --> 39:40.358
So...

39:41.558 --> 39:42.894
You want to take another shot?

39:43.799 --> 39:44.911
Actually, no.

39:45.156 --> 39:47.166
I thought about what you said.

39:47.167 --> 39:48.607
And you're right.

39:48.999 --> 39:50.679
Just because we've been...

39:51.788 --> 39:53.075
Shaking hands

39:53.195 --> 39:54.267
a lot...

39:54.946 --> 39:57.027
Doesn't mean that I have the right to pry.

39:57.028 --> 39:59.411
So... when you are ready,

39:59.968 --> 40:01.055
you'll tell me.

40:08.462 --> 40:09.709
Coney Island.

40:12.783 --> 40:15.842
We, uh, we had a reception at our place

40:15.843 --> 40:17.221
after my mom's funeral,

40:17.222 --> 40:20.327
and... it was miserable.

40:20.808 --> 40:22.696
I was miserable, and my dad...

40:22.736 --> 40:24.819
Took my hand and he said, uh,

40:24.820 --> 40:26.524
"Let's get the hell outta here, Katie."

40:27.907 --> 40:29.331
And we took the "Q" train,

40:29.503 --> 40:31.351
and we went up to Coney Island.

40:31.741 --> 40:33.734
And we walked up and down that beach,

40:34.255 --> 40:35.672
just enjoying ourselves.

40:35.673 --> 40:37.457
We were still in our funeral clothes.

40:37.959 --> 40:40.383
And the best part was that
we made this little guy

40:40.397 --> 40:43.926
out of the twigs and twine
that washed up on the shore.

40:48.246 --> 40:50.134
Does that make that day

40:50.255 --> 40:52.343
a bad memory or a good one?

40:53.242 --> 40:54.466
Both.

40:56.063 --> 40:57.416
He's a reminder...

40:58.225 --> 40:59.603
That even on the worst days,

40:59.604 --> 41:01.667
there's a possibility for joy.

41:03.388 --> 41:04.500
Nice.

41:08.507 --> 41:10.403
So we'll talk tonight?

41:15.494 --> 41:16.645
I can't wait.

41:49.656 --> 41:50.889
My little girl.

41:51.365 --> 41:55.069
Alexis' moving out got me to thinking.

41:55.521 --> 41:58.130
And after many hours of soul searching,

41:58.131 --> 41:59.528
I have made a decision.

41:59.529 --> 42:00.825
Have you now? Yes.

42:01.090 --> 42:04.275
I have decided, out of the
goodness of my heart,

42:04.797 --> 42:06.891
that I will continue to live here...

42:06.892 --> 42:07.713
rent-free.

42:07.719 --> 42:08.674
Please don't interrupt.

42:08.675 --> 42:11.299
I will continue to live here

42:12.083 --> 42:13.482
so that you, Richard...

42:14.318 --> 42:16.517
Will never, ever be alone.

42:18.407 --> 42:20.696
You'd do that for me, mother?

42:21.258 --> 42:24.042
It's a parent's sacrifice.
