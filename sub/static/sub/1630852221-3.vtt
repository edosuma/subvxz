WEBVTT

01:37.280 --> 01:38.640
It's him!

01:57.840 --> 01:59.920
WE SHALL RISE AGAIN

02:33.039 --> 02:36.919
MOVERS

04:13.120 --> 04:15.039
Welcome back, Don Gennaro.

04:24.959 --> 04:27.639
How you doin'? Trip go well?

04:27.720 --> 04:29.639
It went how it shoulda gone.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.680
But that was yesterday,

04:37.759 --> 04:40.720
now we gotta think about tomorrow,
we got a lot to do.

05:00.040 --> 05:03.480
Easier to understand Chinese
than what's in Gennaro's head.

05:03.560 --> 05:04.959
He's a man on his own.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.000
That's why he needs us.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.439
If we do well with him,

05:15.519 --> 05:18.519
our name can finally spread
outside Ponticelli.

05:35.199 --> 05:36.920
What's going on, counselor?

05:37.000 --> 05:40.639
Ruggieri went to the cemetery
and opened your family chapel.

05:40.720 --> 05:44.040
- What he found...
- I know what he found.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.199
Tell me something I don't know.

05:47.319 --> 05:51.839
I finally got access
to Patrizia Santore's statement.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.120
Hurry up!

06:40.480 --> 06:42.480
The cops! Run!

07:31.319 --> 07:33.079
Look at those bastards!

07:33.680 --> 07:36.399
They took the Vicar and Flush.

07:37.959 --> 07:41.759
We gotta get money to their families,
Flush's got two kids.

07:41.839 --> 07:45.680
How can we do that?
Can we afford it, Federico?

07:46.959 --> 07:49.079
We gotta find a way.

07:52.319 --> 07:54.519
These are our people.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.560
I heard the cops
went into Secondigliano too.

08:01.639 --> 08:03.680
The Seven Buildings, the Smurfs.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.000
What's going on?

08:09.920 --> 08:12.240
We'll soon find out.

08:12.319 --> 08:15.560
They called us, they want to see us.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.799
They took five of my men,

10:16.879 --> 10:19.840
they confiscated
what little stuff was left.

10:21.279 --> 10:23.360
The time for talking's over.

10:23.440 --> 10:26.399
The cops go for us
and the Levantes don't do shit.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.960
Pretty Eyes, we respect you,

10:29.039 --> 10:34.080
your turf suffered the most,
but times are tough for everyone.

10:34.159 --> 10:36.159
- Even for the Levantes.
- The King...

10:36.240 --> 10:40.279
All the work we do for them,
our guys make diddly squat.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.039
Now they won't even pay for our lawyers.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.200
We gotta pay for it all.

10:47.919 --> 10:49.360
It was different with the Savastanos.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.600
- Can I say something?
- What, Lil Monk?

10:52.679 --> 10:56.480
We're talking about turf matters,
you have no turf.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.519
You got a back lot.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.919
He's backwards...

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
it suits him perfectly.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.080
Speak, if you must.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.480
You got the balls
to say it to the Levantes' face?

11:14.519 --> 11:16.960
You gonna tell that nutjob Saro

11:17.039 --> 11:19.480
that we miss the Savastanos?

11:19.559 --> 11:22.519
Who wiped out their family name?

11:23.399 --> 11:26.639
Without the Levantes
giving us the stuff what do we do?

11:27.120 --> 11:29.879
Does your pretty face
have any broker contacts?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.440
Do any of you?

11:37.320 --> 11:40.360
The Levantes
are nothing to me, you know,

11:41.399 --> 11:45.000
but one thing's for sure:
they're in charge here now,

11:45.840 --> 11:48.080
so we gotta deal with them.

11:48.159 --> 11:51.039
Lil Monk, whaddaya suggest?

11:51.759 --> 11:53.679
I'll go talk to them.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.320
Trust me.

12:48.639 --> 12:50.039
Morning.

12:53.159 --> 12:55.519
You're Federico Maccauro.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.440
Everybody calls me Lil Monk.

12:58.559 --> 13:00.240
Who's he?

13:00.320 --> 13:02.120
My brother Cosimo.

13:02.679 --> 13:04.000
What do you want?

13:06.080 --> 13:11.000
The situation in North Naples
isn't good, our people are worried.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.720
That's your problem.

13:12.799 --> 13:16.080
With all due respect
it's also your problem.

13:17.759 --> 13:19.320
How dare you?

13:20.519 --> 13:22.360
This how you talk to me?

13:22.440 --> 13:25.120
- You know you're a nobody.
- I'm not alone.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.440
All the turf bosses and their families
are behind me.

13:29.519 --> 13:31.879
I'm speaking on behalf of everyone.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.799
Tell the turf bosses to chill out,

13:43.320 --> 13:47.279
we'll bring in so much snow
they'll have to buy skis.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.600
We got a new contact,
you'll get the shipment in two weeks.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.480
We can wait two weeks.

13:59.399 --> 14:03.120
Meanwhile, the prisoners cost.
Lawyers, kids in the street...

14:03.200 --> 14:04.639
Whaddaya want?

14:04.720 --> 14:08.240
We'll shut down the spots
until the shipment arrives.

14:08.320 --> 14:13.120
We pay the guys just the same,
so we save them, and you look good.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.080
It's important, right?

14:22.559 --> 14:23.960
Morning.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.279
- We'll let you know.
- Goodbye.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.679
Let's go.

14:39.639 --> 14:40.960
Who was that?

14:41.600 --> 14:43.559
Another problem to solve.

14:48.559 --> 14:52.039
They're up your ass,
better if you go in the van.

14:54.159 --> 14:57.399
Fernando, tell him what they say
about me in Secondigliano.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.440
The truth?

15:01.080 --> 15:05.360
People were waiting
for you to take the neighborhood back,

15:05.440 --> 15:07.480
to see you there with them.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.639
But nothing's changed.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.440
The Levantes are still there.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.159
Hear that, Mistral?

15:19.919 --> 15:24.440
My time in hiding's over,
now it's time to take a few risks.

17:10.599 --> 17:11.960
Don Gennaro.

17:12.039 --> 17:16.319
We're all pleased to see you,
but we need to know why you're here.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.799
This is my home.

17:19.440 --> 17:23.480
But you left it and now
another family's in charge.

17:23.559 --> 17:25.559
That's why I'm here,

17:25.640 --> 17:27.480
to settle matters.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.279
I got contacts
for the best cocaine in the world.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.039
I got the money to turn
this place back into what it was.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.839
Nice words,

17:41.839 --> 17:44.359
but we don't need any more talk.

17:44.440 --> 17:48.839
We're ready to hear your offer
when you got something concrete.

17:58.960 --> 18:02.160
Lil Monk, you talk like you don't know
who's in front of you.

18:09.599 --> 18:11.599
Always remember one thing.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.960
What I say, I do.

18:27.319 --> 18:30.359
Federico, you wanna go up against
Gennaro Savastano?

18:32.839 --> 18:37.400
This is our turf, we were born here
and grew up with them.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.359
Gennaro's a king
who wants his crown back

18:40.440 --> 18:44.200
and like all kings he doesn't give a shit
about the poor bastards under him.

18:46.240 --> 18:49.119
The time's over for working for others,

18:49.200 --> 18:51.640
it's time we put ourselves first.

18:56.079 --> 18:58.759
Gennaro Savastano's
promises are just words,

18:58.839 --> 19:00.839
but why should we choose you?

19:00.920 --> 19:04.079
We'll see everyone gets
a monthly payment like you asked.

19:05.480 --> 19:08.680
Those who miss Gennaro
will know they're better off with us.

19:08.759 --> 19:10.319
And the spots?

19:10.400 --> 19:13.920
We can't afford to shut down the spots.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.359
You gotta talk to your people,
the shipment's on its way.

19:18.079 --> 19:21.039
If you help us, we'll know
how to repay you.

19:22.759 --> 19:24.960
I'll do all I can to keep them calm.

19:30.680 --> 19:33.039
- Good evening.
- Stop.

19:33.119 --> 19:36.119
You don't know
my sister, do you? Come.

19:37.319 --> 19:40.000
Grazia, this is Federico Maccauro.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.920
It's a pleasure.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.680
The pleasure's mine.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.200
Excuse me.

19:55.559 --> 19:57.119
So, are we all agreed?

20:32.839 --> 20:34.559
Don Gennaro!

20:34.640 --> 20:36.359
All good, Igor?

20:36.440 --> 20:39.039
I'm pleased to find you in good health.

20:39.119 --> 20:40.799
How can I help you?

20:41.920 --> 20:45.839
I got a problem, I don't have time
to wait for a new shipment.

20:47.279 --> 20:49.640
I want the Levante's shipment.

20:50.759 --> 20:53.680
- We're not managing that shipment.
- I know.

20:53.759 --> 20:56.279
I want to know when it's due
and who's behind it.

20:58.720 --> 21:02.519
There's a rule among brokers:
don't step on each other's toes.

21:04.200 --> 21:07.160
I'm sorry, but I can't.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.559
Remember one thing, Igor.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.720
Whoever's my friend now,
will be for ever.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.279
I'll see what I can do.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.599
Good man.

22:07.839 --> 22:09.759
Please, have a seat.

22:22.519 --> 22:25.079
What are you doing here at this hour?

22:25.160 --> 22:28.119
I'm here on behalf of your husband.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.680
Then your visit isn't welcome.

22:35.319 --> 22:37.079
How is Gennaro?

22:37.160 --> 22:40.319
He's fine, but he needs your help.

22:46.599 --> 22:49.400
You're an intelligent woman,

22:49.480 --> 22:54.000
you understand by helping your husband
in a situation like this

22:54.880 --> 22:57.440
you would also be helping yourself.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.039
And your son.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.039
How?

23:04.119 --> 23:08.279
With your help, Gennaro Savastano
can be a free man again.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.480
Igor sent someone with this.

24:08.920 --> 24:11.599
The monthly payments,
like we promised.

24:12.920 --> 24:16.319
You speak for everyone,
you collect for everyone.

24:17.359 --> 24:19.599
Tell your people they gotta like us.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.880
- We don't want any more problems.
- They gotta trust us.

24:23.960 --> 24:27.279
Because we're good and generous.

24:28.119 --> 24:31.119
But today we're here
for something more important.

24:49.559 --> 24:52.960
Grazia's not a kid anymore, she's 24.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.279
She needs to get married.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.319
And we want to give her to you.

25:01.359 --> 25:05.119
So we become a big family,
us and Secondigliano.

25:06.720 --> 25:10.440
Family's important,
as my father always used to say.

25:14.440 --> 25:17.519
You sure she's good with it?

25:19.799 --> 25:22.160
Grazia likes what we like.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.119
And we like you a lot.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.839
Is it true you like him, Grazie'?

25:35.599 --> 25:37.480
We're done here.

25:37.559 --> 25:39.079
Let's go.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.160
What's going on?

26:12.640 --> 26:14.720
This is a big deal for us.

26:17.279 --> 26:19.240
If you say so...

26:20.240 --> 26:21.960
congratulations.

26:26.200 --> 26:30.079
- You ever met him?
- No, but I heard a lot about him.

26:31.400 --> 26:35.640
If he's lived so long without losing
control of his turf, he's not a fool.

26:35.720 --> 26:38.519
If he's not a fool,
we'll bring him to our side.

26:38.599 --> 26:40.799
One way or another.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.240
Forgive me for bringing you so far.

27:15.319 --> 27:18.119
Thank you, for seeing us right away.

27:18.200 --> 27:21.079
I'm honored to welcome
Gennaro Savastano.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.680
But I was wondering...

27:25.359 --> 27:28.920
What can a guy like me do
for an important person like you?

27:30.079 --> 27:31.920
You're too modest,

27:32.000 --> 27:35.720
you and your family run things
from here to Salerno.

27:37.960 --> 27:41.160
I know you're waiting
for the Levante's shipment.

27:42.160 --> 27:46.039
If you give it to us,
we'll double its value

27:46.119 --> 27:48.119
and you get to sit at the table with us.

27:49.119 --> 27:51.519
And it'll be a very rich table.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.839
Thank you for the offer,
but everyone knows what I think.

27:58.319 --> 28:00.839
I'm the Gentleman by name and by deed

28:01.319 --> 28:05.000
and if it's been that way for 70 years
it means one thing:

28:05.640 --> 28:08.799
when I give my word, my word is sacred.

28:17.920 --> 28:22.440
Haven't you learned it's better to leave
sacred things out of our world?

28:23.799 --> 28:25.759
Your world, not mine.

28:27.119 --> 28:29.480
Soon there'll be just one world.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.880
And I decide who lives and who doesn't.

29:05.240 --> 29:08.079
Your world ends here.

29:44.279 --> 29:46.119
You look nice.

29:48.200 --> 29:51.000
He's here, he's waiting downstairs.

29:52.240 --> 29:56.039
Make him happy, that way
you make your brothers happy.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.680
Go.

30:11.839 --> 30:15.240
What do you feel like?
Wanna go anywhere in particular?

30:17.119 --> 30:19.039
Wherever you want.

30:20.960 --> 30:24.039
I know that your brothers forced you.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.359
Sorry.

30:40.359 --> 30:43.720
No one's ever said sorry to me
in my whole life.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.839
I'd like an ice cream.

31:00.400 --> 31:05.319
CAMPANIA FRUIT AND VEGETABLE
MARKET

31:09.960 --> 31:11.519
There he is.

31:12.319 --> 31:13.960
It's him.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.240
Yeah, it's him.

31:21.319 --> 31:22.480
Okay.

31:25.519 --> 31:27.599
What's this?

31:27.680 --> 31:30.799
- What's going on?
- Where'd they come from?

31:47.079 --> 31:48.279
We got a problem.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.000
I see.

31:59.079 --> 32:02.160
There's a problem,
the tax police took the van.

32:06.039 --> 32:07.480
How's that possible?

32:11.839 --> 32:14.799
Nothing like that's
ever happened here before.

32:17.799 --> 32:20.559
I don't buy it.

32:20.640 --> 32:24.440
Call the guys and tell them
to keep driving around.

32:25.480 --> 32:28.079
We gotta find this fucking van.

32:55.279 --> 32:57.960
- Where the fuck have you brought me?
- Don't move!

33:31.039 --> 33:35.319
Well done, keep it up and I'll let you
go back to your family.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.960
All right?

33:39.599 --> 33:41.200
Take him.

33:41.279 --> 33:42.759
Move.

33:45.160 --> 33:48.759
- It's down there for sure.
- Keep your eyes open.

33:48.839 --> 33:51.200
- Where the fuck is it?
- Look over there.

33:51.279 --> 33:53.720
I can see the headlights up there.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.119
Go!

33:55.480 --> 33:57.400
There he is.

33:57.480 --> 33:59.160
Turn there.

34:10.079 --> 34:11.760
Follow us!

34:11.840 --> 34:13.719
C'mon!

34:43.599 --> 34:45.119
Aniello!

34:46.119 --> 34:48.239
Aniello, why aren't you getting out?

34:49.119 --> 34:51.679
The van's empty, there's nothing in it.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.559
There's nothing!

34:54.079 --> 34:56.360
Get out, you son of a bitch!

34:58.000 --> 35:00.760
Who the fuck are you?
Where's our driver?

35:00.840 --> 35:03.400
I couldn't help it,
they messed with my family.

35:03.480 --> 35:07.119
Your van's in another warehouse,
they're taking it away.

35:07.199 --> 35:09.400
Who's taking it away?

35:09.480 --> 35:11.800
Speak, you son of a bitch!

35:14.559 --> 35:16.360
Gennaro Savastano.

35:16.440 --> 35:19.960
Go check it out,
maybe they haven't got away yet!

35:31.360 --> 35:32.599
Hurry up.

35:32.679 --> 35:34.559
There it is! Quick!

35:34.639 --> 35:36.559
We'll get it.

35:39.719 --> 35:42.159
There they are, pieces of shit!

35:42.239 --> 35:43.559
Go!

35:43.639 --> 35:45.599
Don't move, asshole!

35:57.800 --> 35:59.239
Fuck you!

35:59.320 --> 36:01.119
Fuck you to death!

36:01.199 --> 36:02.320
We did it!

36:53.760 --> 36:57.039
I saw Pietro Savastano buried
in his wife's family vault,

36:57.119 --> 36:59.480
where no one expected him to be.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.800
He was killed by a shot to the head.

37:07.079 --> 37:10.079
At close range, here,

37:11.440 --> 37:13.360
in the middle of his forehead.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.920
Your husband's a murderer.

37:27.440 --> 37:32.039
According to Patrizia Santore,
but she's disappeared.

37:32.119 --> 37:35.360
She can't appear in court
to confirm it, am I right?

37:35.440 --> 37:39.920
Santore's information is specific
and borne out by the facts,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.280
her testimony is reliable.

37:42.360 --> 37:47.639
So, for you Santore is reliable
for the date of the murder too?

37:47.719 --> 37:48.800
Yes.

37:49.639 --> 37:51.800
February 24.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.559
February 24 is an important date,

37:55.800 --> 37:58.880
because it may be the day
Pietro Savastano died,

37:59.519 --> 38:03.239
but it's definitely the date
that Pietro Savastano was born.

38:03.320 --> 38:07.000
And that day Gennaro was
at the clinic in Rome

38:07.079 --> 38:10.320
at his wife's side
as she was giving birth.

38:11.159 --> 38:14.679
The deposition of the doctor
and the obstetrician.

38:14.760 --> 38:18.159
We still have to hear the nurses
and other patients.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.199
There are dozens of witnesses.

38:22.280 --> 38:24.559
We even have pictures of my mother.

38:27.280 --> 38:30.679
Gennaro, teary-eyed,
holding Pietro in his arms.

38:33.880 --> 38:38.199
At the same time, Patrizia says
he was killing his father in Naples.

38:40.679 --> 38:43.800
How important our children are, sir.

39:33.000 --> 39:33.920
Come.

39:48.440 --> 39:50.440
Be quiet, he's sleeping.

40:41.239 --> 40:43.360
You won, Gennaro.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.280
Are you happy?

40:49.960 --> 40:51.840
We won, Azzurra.

40:55.000 --> 40:59.280
Maybe you don't realize, but Patrizia
could've screwed us 100 times over.

41:00.480 --> 41:02.599
It's thanks to her that we're here,

41:02.679 --> 41:05.800
it's only thanks to her
that we have another chance.

41:11.360 --> 41:13.599
A chance for what?

41:16.360 --> 41:18.679
I tried to live a new life,

41:20.079 --> 41:22.360
but it was just a waste of time.

41:23.199 --> 41:26.639
Everything that happened
taught me one thing:

41:26.719 --> 41:28.679
I already have a home.

41:31.639 --> 41:33.440
And where's your home?

41:35.159 --> 41:37.280
In the middle of a war?

41:39.559 --> 41:42.519
That's what you're offering me?

41:43.639 --> 41:46.039
That's what you want for our son?

41:48.400 --> 41:50.280
Secondigliano's my home.

41:51.639 --> 41:53.599
And your life is together with me.

41:58.880 --> 42:02.239
You've become like the man
you hated the most.

42:07.679 --> 42:09.480
Don't say it.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.519
You're exactly the same as your father.

42:59.280 --> 43:01.440
You want cigarettes, sir?

43:02.960 --> 43:04.880
Gimme two packs.

43:14.039 --> 43:15.119
Here.

43:16.079 --> 43:17.519
Wow, thanks.

43:19.400 --> 43:22.840
You're back now.
You were away for a long time, right?

43:23.599 --> 43:27.119
The first time I came here
I was smaller than you.

43:27.199 --> 43:29.719
And you've become a big shot?

43:29.800 --> 43:32.400
No, I've always stayed the same.

43:33.760 --> 43:35.920
A street kid.

44:24.760 --> 44:27.960
