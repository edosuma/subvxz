00:33.595 --> 00:40.049
False King, God has no mercy on you.

00:41.385 --> 00:48.357
He shall fester you with boils
spawned by your many sins.

00:53.248 --> 00:59.285
A child born in Israel will be
a far greater king than you.

01:00.672 --> 01:05.373
He is born to destroy you
and those of your seed.

01:07.045 --> 01:11.714
God's wrath has come upon you.

01:11.766 --> 01:13.549
Agh!

01:16.387 --> 01:20.857
Agh, agh, agh.

01:23.528 --> 01:24.894
Agh!

01:24.946 --> 01:26.229
Agh!

01:26.281 --> 01:27.596
Agh!

01:27.649 --> 01:28.731
Did you see him?

01:28.783 --> 01:30.032
Did you see Isaiah?

01:30.101 --> 01:31.267
Did you see him?

01:31.319 --> 01:32.401
Did you see him?

01:32.470 --> 01:33.335
- Aahh.
- Fa... father

01:33.388 --> 01:35.331
...father it's me, Antipas.

01:38.493 --> 01:39.575
Antipas,

01:44.883 --> 01:47.500
Wake the priests of the Sanhedrin.

01:47.585 --> 01:48.801
Very well father.

01:48.887 --> 01:50.720
Now.

01:50.788 --> 01:51.971
I will see them now.

01:55.226 --> 01:59.128
Does your majesty value truth?

01:59.180 --> 02:04.734
For there is harsh truth in your dream.

02:04.802 --> 02:06.152
I will hear it.

02:06.237 --> 02:11.324
To step beyond these
walls is to know King Herod

02:11.409 --> 02:12.575
is despised.

02:13.611 --> 02:16.362
The zealots denounce you as a puppet.

02:16.447 --> 02:18.664
Enthroned by the Roman Emperor

02:18.750 --> 02:20.616
against the will of the Jewish people.

02:20.668 --> 02:23.119
Zealots cannot enter my father's dreams.

02:23.171 --> 02:27.290
Unless endowed by sorcery.

02:27.342 --> 02:28.490
Sorcery.

02:28.543 --> 02:30.293
You did not see Isaiah.

02:33.965 --> 02:37.967
You saw a spectre, a figment.

02:38.019 --> 02:39.468
Figment.

02:39.520 --> 02:44.340
The creation of a sorcerer's skill.

02:44.392 --> 02:48.861
But through prayer it can be vanquished.

02:48.947 --> 02:51.814
You are a warrior king.

02:51.866 --> 02:54.867
Your voice can make a vapor of phantoms.

02:54.953 --> 02:56.362
Yes.

02:58.623 --> 02:59.655
A vapor.

02:59.707 --> 03:02.124
Come to the temple.

03:02.193 --> 03:07.363
Through prayer your strength
will grow ever greater.

03:39.330 --> 03:41.730
Well done.

03:41.783 --> 03:44.917
To vanquish phantoms he prays.

03:45.003 --> 03:46.619
Whatever his faults,

03:46.704 --> 03:49.505
a bond between the throne and
temple serves order.

03:49.573 --> 03:52.792
And order serves the
preservation of our people.

03:57.849 --> 03:58.931
Follow me...

04:07.558 --> 04:08.607
Get down...

04:12.897 --> 04:13.963
Greetings.

04:15.233 --> 04:16.815
Greetings my...
Greetings sir.

04:28.162 --> 04:31.464
Father, the nobles who 
are served by these men

04:31.549 --> 04:33.582
offer you gifts from the
land of the Hind.

04:36.637 --> 04:38.387
What do they say of their masters?

04:38.456 --> 04:41.257
That they are from beyond Parthia.

04:41.309 --> 04:44.760
Wanting what of me?

04:44.812 --> 04:47.012
They ask that you hear from their
own lips of their purpose.

04:48.182 --> 04:49.598
Arrange entertainments.

05:09.871 --> 05:11.537
Majesty,

05:11.622 --> 05:14.156
an alignment of the stars has
drawn us here.

05:14.208 --> 05:16.675
These stars.

05:16.761 --> 05:18.210
They foretell a great event.

05:18.296 --> 05:19.595
A child.

05:19.663 --> 05:23.165
Born in your kingdom is
the God of Israel's chosen.

05:23.217 --> 05:24.383
The Messiah.

05:24.469 --> 05:25.801
Messiah?

05:25.853 --> 05:27.553
A King of the Davidic line to restore

05:27.638 --> 05:30.806
the glory of Israel, 
as in the prophecy of Isaiah.

05:30.858 --> 05:31.992
Isaiah.

05:35.029 --> 05:36.123
G...!

05:39.350 --> 05:41.016
Of all the infant boys in my kingdom

05:41.068 --> 05:44.069
how will you find this one child

05:44.155 --> 05:46.022
destined to be the Messiah?

05:46.090 --> 05:47.356
Knowledge that the day and time

05:47.408 --> 05:50.910
of his birth match the
position of the stars.

05:50.995 --> 05:53.796
And the child will give us a sign.

05:53.864 --> 05:55.131
What a blessing.

05:55.199 --> 05:56.260
Yes.

05:59.504 --> 06:00.553
Find this child.

06:03.707 --> 06:07.476
Send me news that I may
come and ... venerate him.

06:09.564 --> 06:11.263
I welcome your holy mission.

06:12.683 --> 06:13.826
Majesty.

07:53.834 --> 07:55.984
Joseph?

07:56.037 --> 07:58.003
What is it?

07:58.089 --> 08:02.207
This attention, adulation of our boy.

08:02.293 --> 08:03.659
We must leave.

08:03.711 --> 08:05.678
Leave? Why?

08:05.763 --> 08:07.663
Herod.

08:07.715 --> 08:10.099
No king allows a rival to his throne.

08:10.167 --> 08:11.634
- But our home?
- Enough!

08:15.473 --> 08:16.777
I know what I feel.

08:18.359 --> 08:19.975
You're leaving?

08:20.027 --> 08:21.560
There's danger here.

08:21.646 --> 08:23.028
Where will you go?

08:23.114 --> 08:24.280
Wherever Herod is not.

08:26.850 --> 08:29.285
Elizabeth, pack our things.

08:30.204 --> 08:32.187
We will go as well. Go on.

08:32.239 --> 08:35.323
Our purpose was visiting your
cousin and now we have none.

09:09.110 --> 09:10.776
On this day,

09:10.861 --> 09:13.162
give no thought to what you do.

09:13.230 --> 09:17.232
By King Herod's order, 
the male babies, all of them!

09:17.284 --> 09:19.868
You seven this way, the rest with me.

09:20.087 --> 09:21.236
In there.

09:22.072 --> 09:23.088
You two there.

09:24.959 --> 09:25.991
Is it a boy?

09:26.077 --> 09:27.092
It's a girl!

09:27.178 --> 09:28.377
Show me.

09:29.130 --> 09:30.245
Please.

09:31.932 --> 09:32.981
No.

09:35.419 --> 09:36.518
Where are your children?

09:36.587 --> 09:38.137
No. No. No. Aahh.

09:38.222 --> 09:39.772
No. Aaagghh

09:42.443 --> 09:44.226
Agh!

09:55.740 --> 09:58.157
Please, I beg you, don't kill my son.

09:58.242 --> 09:59.341
AGH!

10:58.352 --> 10:59.518
Who is there?

11:03.507 --> 11:04.523
Antipas?

11:09.146 --> 11:10.946
My heart.

11:11.014 --> 11:15.534
Agh.

11:15.619 --> 11:16.818
... Help me.

11:16.871 --> 11:17.953
Agh.

11:18.021 --> 11:19.288
Agh.

11:19.356 --> 11:20.522
Agh.

11:20.574 --> 11:26.194
Antipas, Anti.., Ant, Antipas, Antipas...

11:46.905 --> 11:54.933
subtitles by MemoryOnSmells
http://UKsubtitles.ru.

12:06.203 --> 12:10.539
You find comfort here
where your father once ruled.

12:10.591 --> 12:12.958
Comfort.

12:13.043 --> 12:14.459
Better said lament.

12:14.545 --> 12:15.711
I too.

12:15.763 --> 12:17.930
I married to be queen.

12:18.015 --> 12:23.585
Tell me Antipas Tetrarch of fair Galilee,

12:23.637 --> 12:26.138
am I a fool for wanting more?

12:26.223 --> 12:29.691
If so ...
we are both fools.

12:31.612 --> 12:37.783
Promise I will someday
find you here not lamenting,

12:37.868 --> 12:43.655
but ruling Jews, all Jews,
as your father ruled.

12:43.741 --> 12:46.825
All powerful, not a puppet of the Romans.

12:49.296 --> 12:54.049
I will not rest until
I'm on this throne as King.

12:54.635 --> 12:56.251
With you by my side.

13:08.182 --> 13:09.848
Greetings.

13:09.934 --> 13:12.067
The wheel of my cart has
broken on my way home.

13:12.135 --> 13:15.320
I'm a trader from Jerusalem,
please, can you help me?

13:15.406 --> 13:16.989
Jerusalem.

13:17.074 --> 13:19.891
- Shalom.
- Shalom.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.611
Some years back I heard
of old Herod's death.

13:22.663 --> 13:25.414
Did his rule pass to one of his sons?

13:25.482 --> 13:27.449
No, no son of Herod rules now.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.536
Rome sends Governors to rule.

13:34.708 --> 13:36.425
And there's order.

13:36.493 --> 13:37.709
The Romans value that.

13:37.795 --> 13:39.511
What has become of the sons of Herod?

13:39.597 --> 13:41.346
They remain as Tetrarchs.

13:41.432 --> 13:43.966
Each has limited rule over
a piece of the kingdom.

13:44.018 --> 13:45.684
How is life for the Jews?

13:45.769 --> 13:47.519
One gets heavily taxed.

13:47.605 --> 13:49.304
But one gets by.

13:49.356 --> 13:52.357
Here in this land of dog headed gods,

13:52.443 --> 13:56.028
I made great efforts teaching
my son our scripture,

13:56.113 --> 13:59.514
dreaming he might become a man
in the land given off by God.

13:59.566 --> 14:02.484
Perhaps it is time to return, hmmm?

14:19.670 --> 14:22.721
So this is the Holy City of the Jews?

14:26.209 --> 14:30.145
Why don't they hail their new governor?

14:30.213 --> 14:32.898
I don't come seeking their love, Claudia,

14:32.983 --> 14:34.399
only respect.

14:38.989 --> 14:42.607
How do I dress when we
are taken to see the Jewish God?

14:42.693 --> 14:44.993
No one sees him.

14:45.062 --> 14:47.362
They believe he's everywhere.

14:47.414 --> 14:48.864
Everywhere?

14:48.916 --> 14:51.750
But cannot be seen?

14:51.835 --> 14:54.002
How do they know he exists?

14:54.071 --> 14:56.371
Maybe he doesn't.

15:06.917 --> 15:08.383
Como on children...

15:09.053 --> 15:12.387
Ah, he's here, Jesus.

15:12.439 --> 15:15.090
Our cousin Elizabeth has not
seen you since you were

15:15.142 --> 15:17.425
a baby in arms.

15:17.478 --> 15:18.810
I've heard so much about you.

15:18.896 --> 15:19.961
Aha...

15:23.650 --> 15:27.402
I'd given up hope, but a trader
spoke of a Joseph of Nazareth

15:27.454 --> 15:29.237
who'd returned from afar.

15:29.289 --> 15:32.440
I felt at once it was your Joseph.

15:32.493 --> 15:35.544
He brought us six years before he died.

15:35.612 --> 15:37.379
Then blessed be God.

15:37.447 --> 15:39.915
He left you a life that's good.

15:39.967 --> 15:43.785
Is John a priest in the temple, 
like Zechariah?

15:43.837 --> 15:45.220
My son, the Baptist,

15:45.288 --> 15:48.623
he's not beloved of the Temple, 
or they of him.

15:48.675 --> 15:51.259
John found God in the wilderness.

15:51.311 --> 15:52.811
Like Isaiah.

15:52.896 --> 15:54.179
Mmmm.

15:54.264 --> 15:56.314
Talk prophets with Jesus
and he'll recite them

15:56.400 --> 15:57.849
'til our meat goes cold.

16:00.137 --> 16:01.737
You're blessed with such a child.

16:01.789 --> 16:02.971
Jesus too.

16:03.023 --> 16:04.406
He's learned in scripture.

16:04.474 --> 16:05.490
Hmmmmm.

16:05.576 --> 16:09.111
Argues with the scribes and the
Pharisees in the synagogue.

16:09.163 --> 16:12.581
Then you and John would find kinship.

16:12.649 --> 16:14.866
Hmmm, I must first find him.

16:16.503 --> 16:17.753
You should.

16:22.826 --> 16:27.045
This attack on me, this was
beyond insults, beyond threat.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.183
Hold it to their noses.

16:31.268 --> 16:35.604
Let them know what I have suffered.

16:35.672 --> 16:39.691
Put your nose to the
stench that is your people,

16:39.777 --> 16:42.177
who hurled filth at me.

16:42.229 --> 16:47.566
But, for the brave legionnaires
who surrounded my litter,

16:47.651 --> 16:55.523
protecting me ... I should have
died under the hail of stones.

16:55.576 --> 16:59.194
And my wife is attacked in your streets.

16:59.246 --> 17:00.962
- Governor...
- I should level

17:01.031 --> 17:03.364
this holy city

17:03.417 --> 17:05.634
- and cake the ruins with blood.
- Governor,

17:05.702 --> 17:08.170
though some oppose your rule...

17:08.222 --> 17:09.671
And who are they?

17:09.723 --> 17:11.705
You who claim authority?
Do you know that?

17:11.758 --> 17:13.974
If not what value are you to Rome?

17:14.044 --> 17:15.894
Governor, my temple guards have learned

17:15.979 --> 17:20.015
that the attack upon your noble
wife was led by a zealot:

17:20.067 --> 17:21.715
Samuel of Perea.

17:21.768 --> 17:26.688
And why is he not here 
in chains, tortured,

17:26.740 --> 17:29.524
begging that death
relieve his agony? Why?

17:29.576 --> 17:30.859
He and his followers

17:30.911 --> 17:32.410
have fled to the wilds of Galilee.

17:35.999 --> 17:37.999
Your place of rule.

17:38.068 --> 17:39.668
I'll offer rewards.

17:39.736 --> 17:40.902
He'll be betrayed.

17:40.954 --> 17:43.205
- Easily found.
- Found and killed.

17:43.257 --> 17:46.174
Along with all of his followers.

17:46.243 --> 17:49.511
- Killed by you.
- By me?

17:49.579 --> 17:52.247
Do I sense hesitation?

17:52.299 --> 17:54.582
Do I tell the emperor our
enemies find sanctum

17:54.635 --> 17:57.919
- in your realm?
- No.

17:57.971 --> 17:59.521
I'll find him.

17:59.589 --> 18:01.022
Kill him.

18:01.091 --> 18:03.692
Hacked to shreds.

18:03.760 --> 18:05.093
All of them.

18:05.145 --> 18:08.480
Governor we share
your fully justified fury,

18:08.565 --> 18:12.901
the enemies of order,
the enemies of us all.

18:12.953 --> 18:15.537
Then prove it.

18:15.605 --> 18:17.873
The body's of those who
disrespected my wife,

18:17.941 --> 18:24.746
and my office here, 
that I may see them, and soon.

18:58.665 --> 19:01.416
Who were those people?

19:01.484 --> 19:03.868
They're zealots.

19:03.954 --> 19:06.121
Rather than submit they
cut their own throats.

19:28.761 --> 19:32.229
Hear oh Israel, the Lord is our God.

19:32.403 --> 19:34.770
May the Lord bless you and guide you.

19:34.839 --> 19:39.008
May the Lord make his face shed
light upon you and be gracious

19:39.060 --> 19:40.142
unto you?

19:40.211 --> 19:44.063
With these waters ...
cleanse your soul.

19:51.573 --> 19:55.557
May the Lord bless you, 
and give you grace.

19:55.610 --> 19:59.779
Let these waters clean away, 
wash away her sins.

20:04.702 --> 20:06.836
May the Lord shine light upon her.

20:06.904 --> 20:09.038
A new dawn is here.

20:09.090 --> 20:11.407
Come do not be afraid.

20:11.459 --> 20:12.875
Your new birth awaits.

20:13.878 --> 20:16.128
Come to me.

20:16.214 --> 20:18.965
May our God shine bright upon your eyes.

20:21.919 --> 20:23.719
Let this water cleanse your soul.

20:24.555 --> 20:28.190
Are you ready, my son?

20:34.065 --> 20:36.032
Welcome.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.483
You are ready for a new dawn.

20:41.105 --> 20:42.167
Jesus.

20:44.542 --> 20:47.776
Listen everyone, here is the Lamb of God

20:47.829 --> 20:50.546
who will shine a light on all of you!

20:50.614 --> 20:54.834
Here is the one who will wash
away the sin from the world.

20:54.919 --> 20:56.118
Jesus!

20:56.170 --> 20:57.269
Jesus!

20:59.090 --> 21:00.351
Cousin.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.928
How could you know me?

21:05.980 --> 21:08.597
How could I not?

21:08.650 --> 21:12.318
My cousin Jesus, it is you.

21:12.403 --> 21:15.655
All this time I've known of the
prophecy and it's come true.

21:15.740 --> 21:16.800
Come.

21:19.911 --> 21:24.664
People!

21:24.749 --> 21:27.333
The new light is here!

21:34.826 --> 21:37.826
How are you so certain that
what you believe of me is true?

21:37.879 --> 21:40.996
Cousin, in the desert I found communion

21:41.049 --> 21:43.182
with our Lord.

21:43.267 --> 21:45.667
And the voices, they came...

21:45.720 --> 21:47.002
The voices told you I was coming?

21:47.055 --> 21:49.305
Yes. But I'm only to open the way.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.842
God speaking of me?

21:53.895 --> 21:55.978
Yes.

21:56.030 --> 21:57.813
Cousin until this day,

21:57.865 --> 22:00.032
while I'm a man of strong belief,

22:00.118 --> 22:01.701
I have worked a trade.

22:01.786 --> 22:02.851
A carpenter.

22:02.904 --> 22:04.033
Nothing more.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.574
What is prophesied cannot be denied.

22:09.327 --> 22:12.328
The cup will be raised
to your lips, Jesus.

22:15.166 --> 22:16.332
Baptize me.

22:18.702 --> 22:22.054
And I too will go into the desert,

22:22.140 --> 22:25.973
- and listen for the voice of God.
- Yes. I will baptize you.

22:26.310 --> 22:29.378
Though it is you who should baptize me.

22:29.430 --> 22:30.632
You're right.

22:31.549 --> 22:32.761
Come.

22:36.604 --> 22:40.439
Ahhh!!

22:42.994 --> 22:44.243
Ahhh!!!

22:44.328 --> 22:47.229
Let the Lord shine his light upon you.

22:47.281 --> 22:51.867
To the new dawn, the new
light is with you, my cousin.

22:51.919 --> 22:53.619
Come.
Come.

23:30.875 --> 23:33.576
That boat, it was my father's.

23:33.628 --> 23:35.110
Maybe his father's before him.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.746
It was made with iron nails, 
nails have value.

23:39.617 --> 23:42.835
Capped with trunnels
I can chisel them out.

23:46.057 --> 23:47.306
We share.

23:47.391 --> 23:49.258
Half and half.

23:57.468 --> 23:58.567
I must ready my nets.

23:58.636 --> 24:01.237
Fishing nails is easier
than netting fish.

24:01.305 --> 24:03.989
For months now the whole is near empty.

24:04.075 --> 24:05.407
Do you ask God's blessing?

24:07.495 --> 24:10.362
I know about you Jesus of Nazareth.

24:10.448 --> 24:12.448
My brother Andrew follows the Baptist.

24:12.500 --> 24:14.483
He told how he greeted you.

24:14.535 --> 24:15.951
Yes, I remember him.

24:16.003 --> 24:18.504
So like the bug eater, do you preach?

24:18.589 --> 24:21.373
Or just pray like the rest of us?

24:21.459 --> 24:22.685
Take me with you.

24:25.829 --> 24:27.796
Who refuses a hand on the net?

24:55.826 --> 24:56.943
Shall we pray?

25:34.115 --> 25:35.831
Thank the Lord.

25:40.621 --> 25:42.504
Ugh... Uhh...

25:57.939 --> 26:00.306
Jesus.

26:00.391 --> 26:03.425
This is from a single cast.

26:03.477 --> 26:06.779
I've fished years and nothing, 
nothing like this.

26:08.149 --> 26:11.200
We prayed.

26:11.268 --> 26:15.738
Yes but ...
I'm a simple man.

26:15.790 --> 26:17.456
A sinner.

26:17.541 --> 26:22.211
Never, never expecting this.

26:22.279 --> 26:23.511
Follow me Simon.

26:27.835 --> 26:29.585
I'll make you a fisher of men.

26:37.678 --> 26:41.230
Ahhh... Ohhh...

26:41.632 --> 26:42.931
John.

26:42.984 --> 26:46.819
John and James are sons of Zebedee, 
you must see this.

26:46.904 --> 26:49.438
Is this not a wonder?

26:49.490 --> 26:54.443
A wonder brought to us by Jesus,
the carpenter from Nazareth.

26:55.579 --> 26:59.698
This is nothing, only a sign.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.186
And there will be many.

27:03.821 --> 27:04.870
Follow me.

27:09.927 --> 27:15.214
Look into your hearts, 
and you will know that God wills it.

27:29.173 --> 27:33.509
I denounce all those
that shame this land.

27:33.561 --> 27:34.977
Antipas.

27:35.046 --> 27:38.714
The Tetrarch, who in rampant
incest beds his brother's wife,

27:38.767 --> 27:40.600
while suppressing the righteous.

27:44.773 --> 27:47.157
And these

27:47.225 --> 27:50.560
...Spies from the Counsel of Sanhedrin.

27:50.612 --> 27:52.362
The hypocrites.

27:52.431 --> 27:54.564
Hypocrites one and all.

27:54.616 --> 27:57.951
From the grandeur in which they
live they berate the poor,

27:58.037 --> 28:00.921
calling you unclean for the food you eat.

28:01.006 --> 28:02.238
They shame you.

28:02.291 --> 28:03.907
But with a purpose.

28:03.959 --> 28:08.045
People! Come to the temple they say, come.

28:08.097 --> 28:09.179
Buy a lamb.

28:09.247 --> 28:11.598
A white dove. A bullock for sacrifice.

28:11.684 --> 28:15.135
Redeem your sins only with the
death of an animal

28:15.220 --> 28:18.188
born from the farms of our high priests.

28:18.256 --> 28:21.692
They have made of God's
house a market place.

28:21.760 --> 28:27.230
I say to these spies, tell your
generation of vipers to beware,

28:27.282 --> 28:28.398
look heavenward.

28:28.450 --> 28:31.451
Flee the wrath that
will come from the Lord.

28:32.738 --> 28:33.937
Flee from here,

28:33.989 --> 28:38.041
the Day of Judgment is here, arise people!

28:39.745 --> 28:41.078
Rise up people.

28:41.130 --> 28:42.796
Rise!

28:48.804 --> 28:51.138
Arrest the Baptist, a lunatic?

28:51.223 --> 28:53.173
The wilderness crawls with them.

28:53.258 --> 28:56.593
Can you allow more
discord in your domain?

28:56.645 --> 28:57.794
Why me?

28:57.846 --> 28:59.146
He attacks you.

28:59.231 --> 29:00.647
The temple.

29:00.733 --> 29:02.766
Along with you and your wife majesty.

29:02.818 --> 29:05.936
With vile accusations of incest.

29:05.988 --> 29:08.304
I must consider the peasants who hail him

29:08.357 --> 29:09.931
as the coming of the prophet Elijah.

29:15.914 --> 29:18.582
Your father served Rome

29:18.650 --> 29:21.835
by the strength of his rule,
and thus they made him king.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.319
The Romans trusted him

29:23.372 --> 29:25.789
to prevent invasion from the Parthians.

29:25.841 --> 29:28.491
And to keep order among the Jews.

29:28.544 --> 29:30.627
For which he was hated.

29:30.679 --> 29:32.596
Some hated David, and Solomon.

29:32.664 --> 29:34.347
Some hated Moses.

29:34.433 --> 29:36.466
What's your point?

29:36.518 --> 29:37.606
My point.

29:38.854 --> 29:42.139
Achieving a peaceful end of Roman rule.

29:42.191 --> 29:45.559
The restoration of a Jewish king,

29:45.644 --> 29:48.979
who gives Romans the order they demand.

29:49.031 --> 29:51.198
And would Pilate
support that which costs him

29:51.283 --> 29:52.899
his place as governor?

29:52.985 --> 29:54.618
Of course it works to his favor.

29:54.686 --> 29:58.455
Gaining for Rome a vassal Jewish
kingdom that keeps order

29:58.523 --> 29:59.689
that keeps Parthia at bay

29:59.741 --> 30:02.576
without the cost of military occupation.

30:02.661 --> 30:06.079
Pontius Pilot would
return to Rome in triumph.

30:06.165 --> 30:09.499
A strong hand with dangerous
fanatics would be a step

30:09.551 --> 30:11.051
toward that goal.

30:11.136 --> 30:13.637
Leaving you King of the Jews.

30:20.813 --> 30:22.088
Shalom.

30:23.765 --> 30:29.186
You know it is written if your
enemy brings you harm...

30:29.238 --> 30:32.322
Tell me friend, if your enemy
brings you harm what is written?

30:32.390 --> 30:34.390
An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth.

30:34.443 --> 30:36.226
Yes. An eye for an eye.

30:36.278 --> 30:37.828
A tooth for a tooth.

30:37.896 --> 30:40.163
But now I say that if God is love,

30:40.232 --> 30:43.333
then loving is serving God.

30:43.401 --> 30:45.535
And that means you must love your enemy.

30:45.587 --> 30:47.504
You preach weakness.

30:47.572 --> 30:49.256
No, no, strength.

30:49.341 --> 30:51.007
The strength that if
one strikes your cheek,

30:51.076 --> 30:53.176
you turn and you let
him strike the other.

30:53.245 --> 30:55.462
If he takes your cloak,
you give him your tunic.

30:55.547 --> 30:57.247
Can you do this?

30:57.299 --> 30:58.798
What you ask of us.

30:58.884 --> 31:00.600
I will try.

31:00.686 --> 31:04.087
Try with each breath
on each and every day.

31:04.139 --> 31:06.056
Feeling that by our effort will
reveal to God

31:06.108 --> 31:08.525
what is in our hearts.

31:08.593 --> 31:12.095
Knowing that God is love,
and in a kingdom of God

31:12.147 --> 31:14.030
we will love our enemies.

31:14.099 --> 31:15.482
He's crazy.

31:15.567 --> 31:16.783
You can't love enemies.

31:16.869 --> 31:19.602
Love and forgive them,
that we can be forgiven.

31:19.655 --> 31:22.656
And judge not so that you not be judged.

31:22.741 --> 31:25.075
The kingdom of God is within you.

31:25.127 --> 31:26.543
- Another of this...
- Each of you.

31:28.664 --> 31:30.825
Those who look within
themselves will find it.

31:34.119 --> 31:36.002
They walk away.

31:36.088 --> 31:39.005
He is blessed with something, 
I've seen it.

31:39.091 --> 31:41.508
A bountiful catch, maybe nothing more.

31:41.593 --> 31:43.593
Rabi.

31:43.645 --> 31:46.012
Rabi please help me.

31:46.098 --> 31:48.098
I'm cursed.

31:48.150 --> 31:49.316
Why do you say this?

31:49.401 --> 31:52.736
My son is possessed by demons.

31:52.804 --> 31:53.937
Take me to him.

32:11.757 --> 32:16.159
The demons rest, but they will awake.

32:16.211 --> 32:17.510
What's his name?

32:17.596 --> 32:18.845
David.

32:28.273 --> 32:29.472
David, can you hear me?

32:38.650 --> 32:41.351
I'm speaking to you David, 
not to what evil possesses you

32:41.403 --> 32:42.535
but to you.

32:44.990 --> 32:48.041
I speak to you David.

32:48.126 --> 32:49.292
Hear me David.

32:49.361 --> 32:50.710
Hear me David.

32:50.796 --> 32:52.028
That's it.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.080
Ssh.
Ssh.

32:54.166 --> 32:55.865
Be still.

32:55.917 --> 32:57.050
Be still.

32:57.135 --> 32:58.151
Is he gone to see the child?

32:58.237 --> 32:59.202
What's he going to do?

32:59.254 --> 33:01.537
Get back! Get back!
Please!

33:01.590 --> 33:02.973
What is he doing?
What is he doing?

33:03.041 --> 33:05.642
He's casting them out.
Demons!

33:05.710 --> 33:08.011
Demons... Can he do that?

33:13.568 --> 33:15.602
Be still.

33:15.687 --> 33:16.820
David.

33:26.531 --> 33:27.914
David...

33:48.103 --> 33:49.436
Oh no.

33:50.972 --> 33:52.605
Please everyone just.
Step back.

33:57.946 --> 33:59.184
Hear me.

34:01.766 --> 34:03.007
The child is dead.

34:08.156 --> 34:11.574
No, oh no, say it isn't so.

34:47.612 --> 34:48.945
Water.

34:56.670 --> 34:58.455
David.

34:58.507 --> 35:00.256
My son.

35:04.463 --> 35:06.262
I'm thirsty.

35:06.331 --> 35:08.131
Yes.

35:11.470 --> 35:13.937
Thank you.

35:14.005 --> 35:15.138
Thank you.

36:26.305 --> 36:27.972
Ahhh...

36:48.819 --> 36:50.368
The Baptist.

36:50.454 --> 36:51.653
As promised.

36:51.705 --> 36:53.988
Mother, he's the one 
who slanders our house?

36:54.041 --> 36:57.736
Salome this is not for your eyes.

37:25.289 --> 37:26.905
Take him away.

37:26.990 --> 37:29.908
Let him rot, and his
prophecy rot with him.

38:01.358 --> 38:03.525
Tell me, Rabbi.

38:03.577 --> 38:05.610
In Jerusalem will you denounce the Romans

38:05.696 --> 38:07.061
and those in league with them?

38:07.114 --> 38:08.947
I'm not a zealot.

38:09.032 --> 38:12.033
I come only to bring word of God's love.

38:12.085 --> 38:14.085
And to say that all must be born again.

38:14.171 --> 38:15.666
Born a second time?

38:16.623 --> 38:19.424
One can't re-enter the womb, Rabbi.

38:19.509 --> 38:21.793
Or is that one of the wonders
that supposedly

38:21.879 --> 38:23.461
you have wrought?

38:23.547 --> 38:26.381
Are you a scribe or a Pharisee?

38:26.433 --> 38:29.083
Are your words not for all?

38:29.136 --> 38:31.102
Yes for all.

38:31.188 --> 38:34.306
I'm here to speak of a light
coming into the world.

38:34.391 --> 38:38.276
And those who live by the
truth can enter this light,

38:38.362 --> 38:39.728
knowing it.

38:39.780 --> 38:43.231
It can be plainly seen that
whatever they do from them on,

38:43.283 --> 38:44.524
is done through God.

38:47.571 --> 38:48.737
Have you understood?

38:50.106 --> 38:51.239
I have.

38:52.075 --> 38:53.106
Rabbi!

38:57.331 --> 38:58.630
John?

38:58.715 --> 38:59.915
Is it John?

38:59.967 --> 39:02.300
The Tetrarch arrested him.

39:02.386 --> 39:05.220
And they've taken him to the
fortress called Machaerus.

39:05.288 --> 39:07.422
It's in the desert across the Jordan.

39:07.474 --> 39:08.590
There's no hope for rescue.

39:14.014 --> 39:17.265
How do I now speak of love?

39:17.317 --> 39:19.100
Forgiveness, How?

39:23.106 --> 39:25.106
I am trapped by the feelings of
a man who longs to attack

39:25.158 --> 39:26.358
this injustice.

39:30.080 --> 39:33.865
Now I know my father's
anger at how we fail him.

39:33.951 --> 39:38.503
Now I feel I am not to
bring peace, but a sword.

39:51.802 --> 39:53.935
What magnificent buildings.

39:54.004 --> 39:57.171
Who is not awed by this?

39:57.224 --> 39:58.506
Look upon them.

39:58.558 --> 40:02.694
Burn them into your memory, 
for I say that not one stone

40:02.779 --> 40:05.697
will remain upon the other.

40:05.782 --> 40:07.449
All will be thrown down.

40:07.517 --> 40:10.184
All!
All of what you see.

40:10.237 --> 40:13.204
It is written in the book
of the prophet, Malachi,

40:13.290 --> 40:17.575
before the great and dreadful
day of the Lord comes,

40:17.661 --> 40:19.661
I will send you the Prophet Elijah.

40:19.713 --> 40:23.415
Now I say that Elijah did come.

40:23.500 --> 40:27.836
Calling us to redemption
in waters of the Jordan.

40:27.888 --> 40:33.425
For the Lord offers forgiveness
of sin to all with a true heart.

40:33.510 --> 40:35.844
He speaks of John the Baptist.

40:35.896 --> 40:39.264
I was redeemed in the waters
of Jordan by John the Baptist.

40:39.349 --> 40:40.381
Yes.

40:40.434 --> 40:42.767
Jesus speaks of John the Baptist

40:42.853 --> 40:46.237
who has been imprisoned by his enemies.

40:46.323 --> 40:49.074
Yes. Like Elijah, John came.

40:49.159 --> 40:53.061
But they did not know him, 
and did to him as they wished.

40:53.113 --> 40:57.231
Free him.
Vipers. Destroy it.

40:57.284 --> 40:59.334
Those of the Counsel of the Sanhedrin

40:59.402 --> 41:01.069
are a generation of vipers.

41:01.121 --> 41:02.871
Viper!
Yes!

41:02.923 --> 41:04.756
Vipers.
Vipers.

41:08.178 --> 41:09.744
I say destroy this temple.

41:09.796 --> 41:11.713
Destroy it.

41:16.937 --> 41:19.721
And in three days
I will raise it up again.

41:19.773 --> 41:22.557
Destroy this market place
that shames our Lord.

41:22.609 --> 41:26.444
HOSANNA.

41:29.616 --> 41:31.199
Hosanna!

41:52.472 --> 41:55.456
I share your anger, Rabbi.

41:55.509 --> 41:56.554
Let me follow you.

41:58.061 --> 41:59.594
What is your name?

41:59.646 --> 42:01.096
Judas Iscariot.

42:04.484 --> 42:06.017
Bless you Judas.

42:12.526 --> 42:17.278
Jesus challenges us
but I did not hear blasphemy.

42:17.330 --> 42:19.247
And when he called for
the destruction of this temple

42:19.315 --> 42:21.866
calling it a market place,
what is that if not blasphemy.

42:21.952 --> 42:25.153
Many devout Jews criticize the commerce,

42:25.205 --> 42:26.454
the money lending.

42:26.506 --> 42:30.258
Standing there,
he derides this ... beauty,

42:30.326 --> 42:34.679
this grandeur with threats,
derides a place where for me,

42:34.764 --> 42:38.183
each stone is sacrosanct.

42:38.268 --> 42:41.853
A place where every day 700 of
our priests perform rituals

42:41.938 --> 42:45.974
for the truly devout, 
for whom this is the house of God.

42:46.026 --> 42:50.511
To be protected with our lives, our blood.

42:50.564 --> 42:55.283
I heard the Nazarene's words,
and I heard blasphemy.

43:07.998 --> 43:09.497
Joshua? Can we see him Joshua?

43:09.582 --> 43:11.115
Can we see the Baptist?

43:11.167 --> 43:12.250
Ssh.

43:12.318 --> 43:13.515
Get back.

43:23.599 --> 43:25.182
Can we see him?

43:25.250 --> 43:27.217
Impossible.

43:27.269 --> 43:31.021
He'll be taken and killed.

43:31.089 --> 43:33.891
Pass on your words and
bring his response.

43:41.650 --> 43:43.367
Joshua.

43:43.435 --> 43:46.069
They've come.

43:46.122 --> 43:50.491
Thomas and Andrew with news of Jesus.

43:50.576 --> 43:51.850
Then God has blessed me.

43:54.446 --> 43:57.464
They say Jesus now
travels the land preaching

43:57.550 --> 43:59.449
as you have preached.

43:59.502 --> 44:04.922
God offers his son, 
and Jesus takes up the cup.

44:04.974 --> 44:07.424
And you will be reunited with him?

44:07.476 --> 44:09.059
No.

44:09.127 --> 44:11.562
His will be a lone path.

44:11.630 --> 44:14.297
I will be martyred here, in this place.

44:17.937 --> 44:19.803
No sadness.

44:19.855 --> 44:22.439
Praise God for the son
he offers in Jesus.

44:22.491 --> 44:24.191
Pray.

44:24.276 --> 44:26.326
Pray Joshua.

44:28.831 --> 44:29.913
Praise God.

44:32.535 --> 44:33.834
My son.

44:33.919 --> 44:35.008
Mother.

44:39.792 --> 44:42.376
It is said that you've
lured fisherman from Galilee

44:42.461 --> 44:45.095
from honest work to follow as you preach.

44:45.163 --> 44:48.799
Preach what they say is contrary.

44:48.851 --> 44:52.636
Not contrary to the word of God.

44:52.688 --> 44:54.337
Who knows?

44:54.390 --> 44:59.342
My life is about this,
putting bread on the table.

44:59.395 --> 45:02.813
Oh, we don't live by bread alone.

45:02.865 --> 45:07.517
What James means ... it is
said you healed the sick

45:07.570 --> 45:11.121
as if by...

45:11.189 --> 45:13.824
She won't say the word.
But I'll say it. Sorcery.

45:17.546 --> 45:20.581
I comfort the sick.

45:20.666 --> 45:24.468
When they're cured it
is by the hand of God.

45:24.536 --> 45:27.921
Bear in mind what you go
about saying and doing

45:28.007 --> 45:32.059
impacts us as well.

45:32.144 --> 45:33.160
Mother.

45:33.245 --> 45:34.344
James.

45:34.396 --> 45:37.180
All who I call family, how I love you

45:37.233 --> 45:38.849
and will always love you.

45:41.186 --> 45:43.320
You cannot understand
the path I've taken.

45:44.907 --> 45:47.491
But the call of God
comes before all of us.

45:47.559 --> 45:50.894
And for you, I'm just Jesus.

45:50.946 --> 45:53.330
Not the most skilled at carpentry.

45:55.400 --> 45:58.502
And sadly no prophet is
accepted among his own.

46:02.341 --> 46:03.840
I can only hope that maybe someday

46:09.748 --> 46:10.929
...who knows.

46:15.137 --> 46:20.256
The betrothed, are they 
not glorious to behold?

46:20.309 --> 46:24.394
Salome was raised with
the laws of the covenant.

46:24.446 --> 46:28.198
What joy to know my son's
chosen is from a house beholden

46:28.266 --> 46:30.600
to our laws.

46:30.653 --> 46:34.905
We of my house, live by the word of God.

46:34.957 --> 46:36.044
As do we.

46:38.610 --> 46:42.129
Among us are followers of a prophet.

46:42.214 --> 46:43.380
A prophet?

46:43.448 --> 46:46.616
Who spoke like Elijah and washed away sin

46:46.669 --> 46:48.251
in the waters of the Jordan.

46:48.304 --> 46:49.836
And offended the order of things.

46:49.922 --> 46:51.638
As many are offended by his imprisonment.

46:54.059 --> 47:00.430
As Salome's bride price,
I ask for his freedom.

47:00.482 --> 47:04.601
We offer herds, our finest wines,

47:04.653 --> 47:07.020
oils to enrich your house.

47:07.106 --> 47:10.407
Riches do not equal a prophet's life.

47:10.475 --> 47:12.492
His arrest was
favored by the Roman Governor,

47:12.578 --> 47:13.777
and the temple priests.

47:13.829 --> 47:16.813
Do they in Jerusalem
dictate what is done here?

47:16.865 --> 47:19.032
They would tax the air we breathe?

47:19.118 --> 47:22.085
What you ask of me is beyond reason.

47:22.154 --> 47:25.422
The Baptist cannot be released.

47:25.490 --> 47:26.612
Isaac.

47:27.926 --> 47:29.926
Isaac!
Come!

47:31.847 --> 47:34.131
We shall have no place in this house.

47:45.861 --> 47:47.611
You saw her shame.

47:47.679 --> 47:50.230
Until now I've seen the Baptist
as a threat to myself

47:50.315 --> 47:52.482
and to our future rule.

47:52.534 --> 47:54.985
Now I must suffer my daughter's disgrace?

47:55.037 --> 47:56.953
There will be other suitors. Mmmm...

47:58.490 --> 47:59.740
Kill him.

47:59.825 --> 48:02.709
Claim he choked on a fish bone.

48:02.795 --> 48:08.081
If I ruled, I'd kill him
and all who follow him.

48:08.167 --> 48:11.201
I know that voice.

48:11.253 --> 48:12.535
My father.

48:12.588 --> 48:14.337
And how I wish you were he.

48:29.188 --> 48:31.738
We are taxed to death, how are we to eat?

48:32.825 --> 48:34.524
Pay up, pay!

48:36.728 --> 48:37.911
Hey, that man.

48:38.747 --> 48:40.363
Hey jew..
Come on.

48:42.367 --> 48:43.466
Come on...

48:45.954 --> 48:47.537
Tell him I want to dine in his home.

48:49.458 --> 48:51.341
He'll refuse.

48:51.409 --> 48:53.760
The tax collector has no place with God.

48:53.846 --> 48:54.878
He'll not refuse.

48:59.635 --> 49:03.186
My master wishes to dine
at your house this evening.

49:03.255 --> 49:04.387
Me?

49:04.440 --> 49:06.056
Why?

49:06.108 --> 49:08.058
Ask him.

49:08.110 --> 49:09.443
My answer would give offense.

49:16.452 --> 49:17.734
Why him?

49:17.786 --> 49:20.570
God has no love for those who tax us.

49:23.492 --> 49:26.293
I'm not worthy to offer you my table.

49:26.378 --> 49:30.947
Who admits his faults,
and seeks forgiveness

49:30.999 --> 49:32.666
will find redemption.

49:32.751 --> 49:35.135
Look into your hearts
and you will know this.

49:37.455 --> 49:38.788
I am hungry.

49:38.841 --> 49:39.940
Invite me to your home.

49:55.240 --> 50:01.411
You are young, and supple, 
you are as men desire.

50:01.479 --> 50:03.280
None come seeking my hand.

50:07.319 --> 50:08.385
Go on.

50:09.454 --> 50:12.155
We must be careful.

50:12.207 --> 50:15.292
The Baptist has followers even here.

50:15.344 --> 50:17.344
He is a curse upon us.

50:17.429 --> 50:20.830
At fault is my husband's weakness.

50:20.883 --> 50:24.017
Unless our weakness is
failing to use his weakness.

50:27.689 --> 50:30.006
When I'm made ready for sleep,

50:30.058 --> 50:32.943
your husband lingers outside my room.

50:35.480 --> 50:39.149
While he once pledged
to care for you as his own.

50:40.619 --> 50:42.452
That's the beauty you've become.

50:43.855 --> 50:44.988
I'll address this with him.

50:45.040 --> 50:46.373
No.

50:46.458 --> 50:48.992
His lust is repulsive.

50:49.044 --> 50:50.961
But perhaps useful.

50:56.718 --> 50:58.468
Oh.

51:17.651 --> 51:18.951
Unclean.

51:19.234 --> 51:21.985
A leper woman.

51:22.053 --> 51:25.321
Rabbi...

51:25.390 --> 51:27.156
Rabbi cleanse me please!

51:27.225 --> 51:28.224
I was here before you!

51:28.276 --> 51:31.411
Please! Rabbi...

51:31.496 --> 51:33.346
Rabbi please!!

51:33.398 --> 51:34.448
John, draw them water.

51:34.532 --> 51:35.481
- But they're lepers.
- Water.

51:37.785 --> 51:38.818
Drink. Drink.

51:38.838 --> 51:42.223
No. No. No.
Don't drink this.

51:42.406 --> 51:44.156
Bring them some water.

51:44.241 --> 51:45.941
Judas.

51:45.993 --> 51:47.114
Let me look at you.

52:04.712 --> 52:06.512
What is your name?

52:06.597 --> 52:07.629
I'm called Mary.

52:07.681 --> 52:09.298
My mother's name.

52:09.350 --> 52:10.494
Come sit please.

52:10.494 --> 52:11.884
What is your son's name?

52:11.969 --> 52:13.101
His name is Judah.

52:13.171 --> 52:14.304
Judah.

52:14.355 --> 52:15.670
How old is Judah?

52:15.723 --> 52:16.838
12.

52:16.891 --> 52:18.140
May I touch you?

52:18.192 --> 52:20.225
Gently.

52:20.311 --> 52:22.895
You are without fear Mary?

52:22.980 --> 52:25.353
I don't fear disease of
the skin or the flesh.

52:26.367 --> 52:27.816
Only disease of the spirit.

52:30.037 --> 52:33.405
Ah, it's something you've known.

52:33.490 --> 52:35.574
I'm from Magdala.

52:35.659 --> 52:36.742
Do you know Magdala?

52:39.863 --> 52:42.530
A barracks town for Roman troops.

52:42.583 --> 52:45.913
Where Jewish daughters are enslaved to
pay the tax debts of their families.

52:48.255 --> 52:51.006
You would see an end to such suffering.

52:51.058 --> 52:52.674
I'm told it's your purpose.

52:52.726 --> 52:56.678
Oh be certain it is Mary from Magdala.

52:56.730 --> 52:59.064
Then my purpose must be serving you.

53:03.187 --> 53:04.853
Thank you.

53:08.108 --> 53:11.410
Blessed are the poor in spirit

53:11.495 --> 53:14.913
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

53:14.999 --> 53:19.734
Blessed are those who mourn,
for they will be comforted.

53:19.787 --> 53:24.506
Blessed are the meek, 
for they will inherit the earth.

53:24.574 --> 53:29.411
Blessed are those who
hunger and thirst...

53:29.463 --> 53:31.013
Is it the Nazarene who speaks?

53:31.081 --> 53:32.464
Yes.

53:32.549 --> 53:35.183
And those who should be tending
my fields are here bewitched

53:35.252 --> 53:37.135
by him.

53:37.221 --> 53:40.772
Blessed are those persecuted

53:40.858 --> 53:42.441
for their righteousness,

53:42.526 --> 53:47.396
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven?

53:47.448 --> 53:54.486
Your father knows your needs,
knows them before you ask.

53:54.571 --> 53:56.738
So this then is how you should pray.

54:01.378 --> 54:07.082
Our Father in Heaven,
hallowed be your name.

54:08.218 --> 54:12.087
Your kingdom come, your will be done,

54:12.139 --> 54:16.558
on earth as it is in heaven.

54:16.626 --> 54:24.232
Give us this day our daily bread, 
forgive us our debts,

54:24.301 --> 54:27.436
as we also forgive our debtors.

54:27.488 --> 54:33.108
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

54:34.161 --> 54:37.863
For yours is the Kingdom,

54:37.948 --> 54:40.332
the power

54:40.417 --> 54:42.751
and the glory.

54:42.819 --> 54:44.252
Forever.

54:44.321 --> 54:45.563
Amen.

54:52.496 --> 54:53.595
Governor,

54:53.663 --> 54:56.264
I saw huge crowds of men
enraptured as he spoke

54:56.333 --> 55:00.018
his platitudes in the crude
accent of some Galilean peasant.

55:00.104 --> 55:03.071
They wept, were overcome
believing he is the Messiah

55:03.140 --> 55:05.357
come to bring God's wrath upon Rome.

55:05.442 --> 55:07.943
And what is more,
we've learned he's a cousin

55:08.011 --> 55:09.778
of the Baptist.

55:09.846 --> 55:12.030
We're being
menaced by a family of lunatics.

55:12.116 --> 55:14.399
There's real danger here.

55:14.485 --> 55:16.568
If he could rally zealots
to free the Baptist,

55:16.653 --> 55:20.655
there could be an uprising in Galilee.

55:20.708 --> 55:22.023
What's his name, this man?

55:22.076 --> 55:23.375
Jesus of Nazareth.

55:26.696 --> 55:29.748
His cousin the Baptist should
be killed without delay.

55:29.833 --> 55:33.034
That undercuts any
thoughts of freeing him,

55:33.087 --> 55:35.387
and also makes this Jesus aware
of the fate

55:35.472 --> 55:36.671
that could well await him.

55:41.678 --> 55:42.928
Leave.

55:46.100 --> 55:47.399
Finally.

55:47.484 --> 55:48.550
Meaning?

55:48.602 --> 55:49.684
Pilot's blessing

55:51.739 --> 55:52.854
...kill the Baptist.

55:54.858 --> 55:57.075
Killing him is a
convenience for the Roman.

55:57.161 --> 55:58.744
Not for me.

55:58.829 --> 56:01.563
I'm already vilified for
imprisoning the Baptist,

56:01.615 --> 56:04.533
kill him and all of
Galilee turns against me.

56:04.585 --> 56:07.335
Pontius Pilate's praise of you to Caesar

56:07.404 --> 56:09.171
could make you king.

56:09.239 --> 56:11.840
What I see is Pilate
praising what serves Pilate.

56:11.908 --> 56:14.709
If he wants the Baptist dead,
let him drag him to Jerusalem

56:14.762 --> 56:17.763
and nail him to the cross.

56:17.848 --> 56:19.965
So you are set on doing nothing.

56:23.637 --> 56:26.388
Salome told me you asked her
to dance at the feast

56:26.440 --> 56:29.524
for your birthday tonight.

56:29.593 --> 56:31.810
Did she also tell you that she refused?

56:31.895 --> 56:34.396
She's not a performer
from the market place.

56:34.448 --> 56:38.066
You must offer her something.

56:38.118 --> 56:40.068
Meaning ... she is her mother's daughter.

56:42.272 --> 56:43.572
We like our rewards.

56:45.576 --> 56:49.294
And what would hers
be for entertaining my guests?

56:51.298 --> 56:56.168
Suppose I tell her
that whatever she asks for

56:56.253 --> 56:58.086
you will not refuse.

56:58.138 --> 56:59.888
She must dance to my satisfaction.

57:02.009 --> 57:03.842
Be certain she will.

57:36.126 --> 57:38.043
You remember your promise.

57:41.765 --> 57:44.432
Salome, tell him.

58:01.351 --> 58:04.119
Show Caesar you're a man.

58:04.187 --> 58:05.487
And show us too.

58:19.753 --> 58:20.989
Salome...

58:21.871 --> 58:22.969
Leave it...

58:54.204 --> 58:55.370
Ahhh!!!

58:59.409 --> 59:00.759
Uhhhh....

59:02.412 --> 59:03.712
Ohhh!!!

59:11.484 --> 59:12.549
Rabbi!

59:14.738 --> 59:17.455
Thomas and Andrew welcome.

59:19.543 --> 59:20.742
They've murdered him.

59:21.361 --> 59:22.377
Cut his head off.

59:25.532 --> 59:26.548
Beheaded?

59:34.224 --> 59:37.142
You are with us now, you and Thomas.

59:37.210 --> 59:39.010
Come eat with us.

59:54.728 --> 01:00:00.165
Yes, as John has said,
the cup has come to my lips...

01:00:07.907 --> 01:00:09.874
I fear its bitterness, Father.

01:00:15.132 --> 01:00:16.931
Give me the strength to welcome it.

01:00:37.204 --> 01:00:38.570
Who am I?

01:00:38.622 --> 01:00:39.635
What am I?

01:00:42.442 --> 01:00:44.459
How do people call the son of man?

01:00:47.831 --> 01:00:49.297
Tell me?

01:00:49.383 --> 01:00:52.167
Tell me.

01:00:52.252 --> 01:00:56.471
For me ... you are a
giver of courage to act

01:00:56.556 --> 01:00:58.256
as I never imagined.

01:00:59.476 --> 01:01:03.478
Reaching out for the sick ...the unclean

01:01:03.563 --> 01:01:04.796
...without fear.

01:01:04.848 --> 01:01:06.264
But Judas, how am I called?

01:01:06.316 --> 01:01:08.983
I've heard you called coming of Elijah.

01:01:10.687 --> 01:01:12.904
A prophet.

01:01:12.972 --> 01:01:14.305
What else is said?

01:01:14.357 --> 01:01:17.442
Many will believe you're
the Baptist risen from the dead.

01:01:17.494 --> 01:01:19.194
There was no greater prophet than John.

01:01:22.582 --> 01:01:26.785
But you, you who see me eat, sleep, wash,

01:01:26.837 --> 01:01:30.121
know my ever gesture, 
my moods, who do you say I am?

01:01:44.604 --> 01:01:45.806
You're the anointed one.

01:01:48.975 --> 01:01:50.341
Son

01:01:50.393 --> 01:01:51.609
...of the living God.

01:01:56.483 --> 01:02:01.152
Bless you Simon, Son of Jonah.

01:02:01.204 --> 01:02:02.821
No other has said this.

01:02:05.358 --> 01:02:07.792
I think it was revealed to
you by my heavenly Father.

01:02:09.296 --> 01:02:11.863
It is simply what I believe.

01:02:11.915 --> 01:02:14.699
From now on I'll call you Peter.

01:02:14.751 --> 01:02:16.634
Peter?

01:02:16.703 --> 01:02:18.169
In Greek, Peter means rock.

01:02:20.924 --> 01:02:24.642
And on this rock, I'll build my church

01:02:24.711 --> 01:02:27.095
and give you the keys to the
kingdom of heaven.

01:02:32.652 --> 01:02:33.823
I must be alone now.

01:02:42.245 --> 01:02:43.912
You believe he's...

01:02:43.997 --> 01:02:46.698
The Messiah.

01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:50.234
Take great care saying that.

01:02:50.287 --> 01:02:53.538
What harm will come to God's chosen?

01:03:15.445 --> 01:03:16.761
Before these Counsel

01:03:16.813 --> 01:03:20.315
of the Sanhedrin proceeds to
judgment I should tell you

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.901
we have been warned that

01:03:22.953 --> 01:03:26.454
the Nazarene Jesus has come to Jerusalem.

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:30.625
It is proposed that we forbid
him to enter

01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:33.745
our holy house of God.

01:03:33.797 --> 01:03:35.780
Yes. Yes.

01:03:35.832 --> 01:03:38.950
No. No. No. No.

01:03:39.002 --> 01:03:41.986
We may dispute his words,

01:03:42.055 --> 01:03:46.174
but we cannot deny a devout
Jew entry to the temple.

01:03:48.094 --> 01:03:51.062
I ... I have heard
Jesus speak and he is to be

01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:53.131
welcomed, not shunned.

01:03:53.183 --> 01:03:55.149
Allow him ... allow him in.

01:03:58.238 --> 01:03:59.520
Deny Him.

01:04:01.441 --> 01:04:08.746
So, the Nazarene enters this very room.

01:04:08.815 --> 01:04:14.919
Where his name is spoken,
dissention follows.

01:04:14.988 --> 01:04:16.170
Allow him.

01:04:16.256 --> 01:04:18.289
He must be allowed entry.

01:04:18.341 --> 01:04:19.591
He is a Jew.

01:04:19.659 --> 01:04:20.792
Like us.

01:04:20.844 --> 01:04:25.263
But I'll not push to forbid him entry.

01:04:25.331 --> 01:04:30.268
I only recall Jeremiah's
warning of false prophets.

01:04:30.336 --> 01:04:33.221
They fill you with false hopes.

01:04:33.306 --> 01:04:37.174
They speak visions from their own minds.

01:04:37.227 --> 01:04:39.944
Not from the mouth of the Lord.

01:04:40.013 --> 01:04:42.513
When Jesus says the meek
shall inherit the earth,

01:04:42.565 --> 01:04:45.950
there's nothing meek about him,
nor those that follow him.

01:04:46.019 --> 01:04:49.353
But it's true they seek
to inherit the earth.

01:04:49.406 --> 01:04:51.956
Allow him, allow him in!

01:04:52.025 --> 01:04:53.207
It's the law.

01:04:53.293 --> 01:04:55.793
ALLOW HIM! ALLOW HIM!

01:04:58.748 --> 01:04:59.914
We have lost.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.700
Let the Nazarene come.

01:05:02.752 --> 01:05:05.503
With luck he may condemn himself.

01:05:05.555 --> 01:05:07.138
Bring the woman.

01:05:09.643 --> 01:05:14.262
We are now to hear and judge the
case of a woman who had defiled

01:05:14.347 --> 01:05:17.381
the sacred covenants of marriage.

01:05:17.434 --> 01:05:23.354
And thus brought great shame
upon her husband's house.

01:05:56.473 --> 01:05:57.638
What shall we do?

01:05:57.724 --> 01:05:58.723
Let the guards take him away?

01:05:58.810 --> 01:05:59.774
We're enacting a law.

01:05:59.859 --> 01:06:01.142
I want you to provoke him.

01:06:04.397 --> 01:06:05.780
We stand here ready to enact

01:06:05.865 --> 01:06:08.700
the Law of Moses, an adulteress
condemned by the High Court

01:06:08.768 --> 01:06:10.985
of the Temple is to be stoned.

01:06:11.071 --> 01:06:13.955
A punishment called for by Moses.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.157
Do you deny the law
revealed on Mount Sinai?

01:06:18.945 --> 01:06:20.828
She has sinned.

01:06:20.914 --> 01:06:22.663
And been judged.

01:06:22.749 --> 01:06:25.416
Do you oppose the law of the Torah?

01:06:29.923 --> 01:06:33.958
Is his silence a defense
of her fornications?

01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:35.343
Her harlotry?

01:06:37.296 --> 01:06:41.315
I know you, Jesus of Nazareth.

01:06:41.401 --> 01:06:44.018
You have opinions on everything.

01:06:44.104 --> 01:06:46.437
What's his opinion on this?

01:06:53.613 --> 01:06:56.697
Any among you who is without sin,

01:06:56.783 --> 01:06:59.450
let him be the first
to cast a stone at her.

01:07:02.488 --> 01:07:04.255
Any among you who is without sin?

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:12.346
God has set forth the law not him.

01:07:12.432 --> 01:07:15.299
The law must be carried out.

01:07:15.351 --> 01:07:16.667
Kill her.

01:07:20.673 --> 01:07:22.056
Here, kill her.

01:07:27.530 --> 01:07:28.980
You kill her.

01:07:41.628 --> 01:07:42.827
I cannot.

01:07:46.082 --> 01:07:47.965
Then neither can I.

01:07:58.211 --> 01:08:01.545
I have begged for forgiveness.

01:08:15.561 --> 01:08:17.078
Go and sin no more.

01:08:22.902 --> 01:08:25.736
We are the law.

01:08:25.787 --> 01:08:29.924
We will see you accused
judged and punished for this.

01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:52.444
To maintain the order that
your office demands

01:08:52.455 --> 01:08:55.006
we must have obedience to our laws.

01:08:55.046 --> 01:08:59.948
Now this man, this false
claimant to religious stature

01:09:00.002 --> 01:09:03.752
has thwarted the legal
execution of an adulteress.

01:09:03.911 --> 01:09:05.995
You have a court, try him, stone him.

01:09:06.063 --> 01:09:07.747
Yes that would of
course be my first thought,

01:09:07.832 --> 01:09:10.366
but with shame I must
say that even among us,

01:09:10.417 --> 01:09:13.368
even among the Sanhedrin
are those he has corrupted.

01:09:13.421 --> 01:09:15.069
My laws are Roman.

01:09:15.122 --> 01:09:16.921
His crime is not Sedition.

01:09:17.008 --> 01:09:18.240
Is it not.

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:20.626
He rails against Roman taxes.

01:09:20.712 --> 01:09:22.962
If I were to crucify every Jew

01:09:23.046 --> 01:09:24.513
who rails against our taxes,

01:09:24.582 --> 01:09:27.600
I would have to level the
Cedars of Lebanon for wood.

01:09:31.773 --> 01:09:34.890
His crime must be an attack
against our Emperor, our rule.

01:09:34.942 --> 01:09:36.692
He attacks those who support your rule,

01:09:36.761 --> 01:09:38.310
does that not inspire concern.

01:09:38.395 --> 01:09:40.979
Concern, but nothing that validates action.

01:09:41.064 --> 01:09:43.983
Make a case for Sedition, with evidence.

01:09:44.068 --> 01:09:46.819
Learn where he speaks and with whom.

01:09:46.904 --> 01:09:51.323
Prove that he is a threat to Roman rule

01:09:51.408 --> 01:09:53.325
...and I will have him crucified.

01:09:57.715 --> 01:09:59.915
Each day I hear the
servants speaking of him.

01:10:02.837 --> 01:10:05.805
What is the message of this Jesus?

01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:08.123
Many things.

01:10:08.176 --> 01:10:10.292
Nothing that concerns us.

01:10:10.344 --> 01:10:12.595
What?

01:10:12.647 --> 01:10:14.930
It'll bore the slaves.

01:10:14.982 --> 01:10:16.682
The curse of being a slave is boredom

01:10:16.768 --> 01:10:17.966
with what we do.

01:10:20.521 --> 01:10:22.071
Not all we do.

01:10:24.609 --> 01:10:27.309
Enough!

01:10:27.361 --> 01:10:29.779
What does he preach?

01:10:29.831 --> 01:10:33.783
That God wants
the meek to inherit the earth.

01:10:33.835 --> 01:10:36.485
The poor to be rich.

01:10:36.537 --> 01:10:38.788
The weak to be strong.

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:42.591
Platitudes of popular appeal.

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:44.326
None of it to be believed?

01:10:44.378 --> 01:10:46.679
Well it flies in the face of history.

01:10:46.764 --> 01:10:50.466
Caesarea is named after a conqueror.

01:10:50.518 --> 01:10:52.134
To the south of us is Alexandria,

01:10:52.186 --> 01:10:54.887
also named for a conqueror.

01:10:54.972 --> 01:11:00.342
If there really is one
single ... all powerful God,

01:11:00.394 --> 01:11:06.282
as Jesus and these Jews claim,
he clearly favors the strong,

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:07.983
over the weak.

01:11:10.071 --> 01:11:13.155
Things are as the Gods intend.

01:11:15.877 --> 01:11:21.747
The meek such as this lovely creature

01:11:21.833 --> 01:11:24.300
will never inherit the earth.

01:11:28.205 --> 01:11:29.638
HA!

01:11:35.096 --> 01:11:39.315
This man Jesus he has
drawn many to cast away

01:11:39.383 --> 01:11:41.901
their wealth to follow him.

01:11:41.986 --> 01:11:44.186
He lures sane men from their wealth?

01:11:44.238 --> 01:11:46.989
He speaks of a time, soon coming,

01:11:47.057 --> 01:11:49.441
when rich men will be poor.

01:11:49.527 --> 01:11:55.063
Powerful men cast down and ...
the Temple itself destroyed

01:11:55.116 --> 01:11:56.832
by God's wrath.

01:11:56.901 --> 01:11:59.201
The Priests are right,
this Nazarene is a menace.

01:12:01.906 --> 01:12:03.572
Search among your ranks,

01:12:03.624 --> 01:12:06.408
Chuza, find those who are most trustworthy.

01:12:07.244 --> 01:12:10.212
All information about this
Nazarene is of value to me.

01:12:22.092 --> 01:12:23.776
Matthew!

01:12:23.861 --> 01:12:26.562
Far from the old days when
squeezing taxes from peasants

01:12:26.614 --> 01:12:29.932
was like ringing water from stones.

01:12:29.984 --> 01:12:31.483
How astonished I was to hear
that you'd given up

01:12:31.569 --> 01:12:34.486
all your wealth to follow the Nazarene.

01:12:34.572 --> 01:12:36.071
Who is he?

01:12:36.123 --> 01:12:39.291
A tax collector who feels as

01:12:39.377 --> 01:12:43.879
Matthew once did. Regretting
what he must do.

01:12:43.948 --> 01:12:45.247
And you would be?

01:12:45.299 --> 01:12:47.499
Judas Iscariot.

01:12:47.585 --> 01:12:49.635
I'm Asher.

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.221
And your caution is well advised.

01:12:52.289 --> 01:12:56.091
The Nazarene's fame
breeds envy even hatred.

01:12:56.143 --> 01:12:58.627
But I for one admire the
choice that you've made.

01:12:58.679 --> 01:13:00.128
Change your ways.

01:13:00.181 --> 01:13:01.397
And follow us.

01:13:01.465 --> 01:13:02.648
How I wish.

01:13:02.733 --> 01:13:04.733
How I wish, but the
burden of hungry mouths.

01:13:04.802 --> 01:13:06.602
And the burden of a fine horse?

01:13:06.654 --> 01:13:08.153
Yes.

01:13:08.239 --> 01:13:10.489
I admit weakness.

01:13:10.574 --> 01:13:12.691
Isn't that one step towards redemption?

01:13:15.663 --> 01:13:19.949
It is said that the Rabbi goes
to Jerusalem for Passover.

01:13:20.001 --> 01:13:21.316
It's his intention.

01:13:21.369 --> 01:13:22.663
I know of a dwelling there.

01:13:22.753 --> 01:13:23.836
I have well placed friends.

01:13:23.921 --> 01:13:25.788
A place has been offered.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.873
Is the dwelling within the city?

01:13:27.959 --> 01:13:29.875
I may seek you out Matthew.

01:13:29.961 --> 01:13:32.211
A morning's walk from the gate.

01:13:32.296 --> 01:13:36.715
Home of a land owner, Lazarus.

01:13:36.801 --> 01:13:38.801
God speed your journey.

01:13:43.391 --> 01:13:45.724
I have urgent news for
the Tetrarch's steward.

01:13:45.810 --> 01:13:47.064
Open the gates.

01:13:51.983 --> 01:13:53.047
Asher.

01:13:53.107 --> 01:13:55.617
Send word to the Tetrarch,
I have news of the Nazarene.

01:13:55.686 --> 01:13:57.987
And be ready to open your coffers, Chuza,

01:13:58.039 --> 01:14:00.689
what I bring is of great value.

01:14:00.741 --> 01:14:02.708
Jesus is staying outside
the city at the house

01:14:02.793 --> 01:14:04.660
of a land owner named Lazarus.

01:14:04.712 --> 01:14:07.246
He can't be arrested
there too many people.

01:14:07.331 --> 01:14:10.049
We must know his movements
when he comes to Jerusalem.

01:14:10.134 --> 01:14:11.867
We need somewhere quiet.

01:14:11.919 --> 01:14:13.302
I'll put a watch on the house.

01:14:23.764 --> 01:14:25.547
Outside the wall dressed as pilgrims,

01:14:25.599 --> 01:14:28.434
spies are watching us.

01:14:28.519 --> 01:14:31.186
To report on our drunkenness, 
hey Lazarus?

01:14:33.223 --> 01:14:35.223
My debauchery.

01:14:35.276 --> 01:14:38.660
That I consort with sinners and
tax collectors, right Matthew?

01:14:38.729 --> 01:14:41.080
Former sinner and tax collector.

01:14:41.165 --> 01:14:44.166
And I know the labels put on me.

01:14:44.234 --> 01:14:45.617
We will put them on trial?

01:14:45.703 --> 01:14:47.086
Put whom on trial?

01:14:47.171 --> 01:14:48.287
Them.

01:14:48.372 --> 01:14:50.238
Those who are against us.

01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:54.076
When you're king, James and I 
wish to sit by your throne

01:14:54.128 --> 01:14:56.078
as sentence is passed on them.

01:14:56.130 --> 01:14:58.263
See you condemn them to eternal flames.

01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:06.138
That's how you
imagine the kingdom of God?

01:15:06.223 --> 01:15:09.391
Me on a throne?

01:15:09.443 --> 01:15:11.426
Do I wear a gold crown?

01:15:11.479 --> 01:15:14.480
I would think a crown of the purest gold.

01:15:14.565 --> 01:15:17.599
What, like some earthly king?

01:15:17.651 --> 01:15:21.286
Do I preside over
lackeys and ring kissers?

01:15:21.498 --> 01:15:23.915
I mean you travel with me, 
your ears are open to every word,

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.900
but you hear nothing.

01:15:25.952 --> 01:15:28.253
Nothing.

01:15:28.338 --> 01:15:31.873
Have you so failed to understand
being who I am, what I must do?

01:15:34.127 --> 01:15:37.045
Whoever would be a master,
must first be a slave.

01:15:37.097 --> 01:15:40.048
Who wants to be served must first serve.

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:43.468
I am here to give my life
as a ransom for the many.

01:15:43.553 --> 01:15:47.355
In the Kingdom of God 
there are no thrones, no crowns,

01:15:47.423 --> 01:15:49.557
no rule of nations.

01:15:49.609 --> 01:15:53.311
My reward for earthly
service will be suffering.

01:15:53.396 --> 01:15:54.812
Understand that.

01:15:54.898 --> 01:15:57.282
Suffering.

01:15:57.367 --> 01:15:59.367
To bring the message of God's love,

01:15:59.435 --> 01:16:02.403
I am the resurrection and the life.

01:16:02.455 --> 01:16:05.773
And those who believe in me,
even though they die, will live.

01:16:17.062 --> 01:16:19.095
If you are praying I will leave.

01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:21.594
I came here to pray.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:23.980
Pray to control my anger
and my frustration.

01:16:27.012 --> 01:16:31.164
But then I heard my father's
voice in that song,

01:16:31.216 --> 01:16:34.667
in the sweetness of that song.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:37.604
Mhmmm...

01:16:37.673 --> 01:16:39.840
Your anger is gone.

01:16:43.112 --> 01:16:47.180
Do you know the prophets? What they
say awaits the one God has sent?

01:16:47.232 --> 01:16:48.531
There was little talk of prophets

01:16:48.617 --> 01:16:50.150
in the barracks of Magdala.

01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:53.453
Well, you know my words.

01:16:53.521 --> 01:16:55.622
Yes.

01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:56.882
And that's enough.

01:17:00.195 --> 01:17:01.211
Yes...

01:17:01.997 --> 01:17:04.164
Then I'll leave you to pray.

01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:08.368
Mary.

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:12.505
The cup from which I must drink, 
how very bitter it is.

01:17:16.378 --> 01:17:17.727
Go Mary of Magdala.

01:17:50.345 --> 01:17:51.428
What is this?

01:17:51.513 --> 01:17:53.797
This beast is little
more than a yearling.

01:17:53.882 --> 01:17:55.799
He told us to find a donkey colt.

01:17:55.884 --> 01:17:57.384
Prophecy of Zachariah.

01:17:57.436 --> 01:18:00.420
He enters Jerusalem on that for Passover?

01:18:00.472 --> 01:18:02.555
The Messiah will arrive at
the holy city astride

01:18:02.607 --> 01:18:04.757
a donkey colt.

01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:06.443
Now he acts out a prophecy.

01:18:06.528 --> 01:18:07.560
Why should he not?

01:18:10.115 --> 01:18:12.649
What more is there in the
prophecy of the Messiah's coming?

01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:17.120
Say it.

01:18:17.205 --> 01:18:18.905
We all share however it goes.

01:18:20.542 --> 01:18:23.076
The Messiah will be falsely accused.

01:18:23.128 --> 01:18:24.110
He'll be beaten.

01:18:24.162 --> 01:18:25.445
Spat upon.

01:18:25.497 --> 01:18:26.946
He'll be killed. And all those
who love him will look on

01:18:26.999 --> 01:18:30.583
unable to stop the agony.

01:18:30.635 --> 01:18:31.668
And those who follow him?

01:18:40.178 --> 01:18:41.261
I see.

01:19:07.873 --> 01:19:09.205
I'm told of a great Rabbi

01:19:09.291 --> 01:19:11.824
who was asked to recite the
Torah while standing on one leg.

01:19:13.328 --> 01:19:15.995
He said, 'do not unto others as 
you would not have them do unto you'.

01:19:16.048 --> 01:19:19.549
This is the true wisdom of the Torah.

01:19:19.634 --> 01:19:21.468
The rest is all commentary.

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.553
Go and learn it.

01:19:23.638 --> 01:19:25.438
Do you share his belief?

01:19:25.507 --> 01:19:26.723
I do.

01:19:26.808 --> 01:19:32.028
Saying simply, love your
neighbor as you love yourself.

01:19:32.114 --> 01:19:35.315
But I put one commandment
even before this.

01:19:35.367 --> 01:19:39.402
Hear, oh Israel, the Lord our God is one.

01:19:39.488 --> 01:19:41.521
Love the Lord your God
with all your heart,

01:19:41.573 --> 01:19:44.290
your mind and your strength, saying this,

01:19:44.359 --> 01:19:45.858
you are close to the Kingdom of God.

01:19:45.911 --> 01:19:47.210
Rabbi.

01:19:47.295 --> 01:19:48.962
While some oppose you.

01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:51.581
The wisdom of your
words is not lost on us.

01:19:51.666 --> 01:19:55.468
Rabbi, what say you of taxes?

01:19:55.537 --> 01:20:01.040
Should Jews pay taxes
to this man in Rome?

01:20:01.093 --> 01:20:03.726
What do you say Rabbi?

01:20:03.812 --> 01:20:05.812
Give him an answer Rabbi.

01:20:11.019 --> 01:20:12.602
Let me see the coin.

01:20:20.412 --> 01:20:21.744
Who is this?

01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:24.414
You know.

01:20:24.499 --> 01:20:27.283
That's Caesar Tiberius.

01:20:27.369 --> 01:20:29.702
What do you think?

01:20:29.754 --> 01:20:33.006
Should Jews pay taxes to Caesar?

01:20:38.763 --> 01:20:42.265
Give to Caesar that which is Caesar's,

01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:45.969
and give unto God that which is God's.

01:20:48.607 --> 01:20:51.391
Leave in peace, Lamb of God.

01:20:54.613 --> 01:20:58.031
Their Lamb of God
will be our lamb of sacrifice.

01:21:08.543 --> 01:21:12.111
That you still
read by the light of a flame.

01:21:12.164 --> 01:21:14.581
I envy you your sharpness of vision.

01:21:14.633 --> 01:21:17.133
The characters are blurred.

01:21:17.219 --> 01:21:20.420
But I know the entire scriptures
by heart and I find it curiously

01:21:20.472 --> 01:21:23.806
comforting to actually
hold them in my hand.

01:21:26.678 --> 01:21:31.097
It is almost your time to start
your duties in the temple and

01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:32.465
you have not slept.

01:21:32.517 --> 01:21:35.468
I have ... failed you.

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:39.072
I've failed the temple.

01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:43.976
When Passover ends, 
the Nazarene, he will leave,

01:21:44.029 --> 01:21:47.247
conceal himself in the hide of the land.

01:21:48.650 --> 01:21:52.669
Then he will return, 
with ever greater numbers

01:21:52.754 --> 01:21:57.657
in his following, all believing
that he is the Messiah,

01:21:57.709 --> 01:22:01.994
all willing to be part of a
rebellion that brings him

01:22:02.047 --> 01:22:03.379
to the throne.

01:22:07.435 --> 01:22:09.018
But I remember,

01:22:11.172 --> 01:22:14.474
I remember as a child, seeing

01:22:17.312 --> 01:22:20.346
...bodies, hundreds of

01:22:20.398 --> 01:22:22.815
...dead Jews,

01:22:22.867 --> 01:22:24.651
killed by the Romans.

01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:27.186
The revolts of Judas

01:22:27.239 --> 01:22:28.454
the Galilean.

01:22:28.523 --> 01:22:31.040
Also hailed as the Messiah.

01:22:33.528 --> 01:22:34.994
Do you understand my fear?

01:22:37.198 --> 01:22:39.966
The horror that this man
could bring to our people.

01:22:40.835 --> 01:22:43.670
Have you confronted him?

01:22:43.722 --> 01:22:45.755
To no avail.

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:49.041
He seeks confrontation then
turns our words against us,

01:22:49.094 --> 01:22:50.760
he mocks us in our own temple.

01:22:50.845 --> 01:22:53.980
God's word is quite clear.

01:22:54.048 --> 01:22:57.717
Any false prophet who incites rebellion

01:22:57.769 --> 01:23:01.487
against God's authority should
be put to death.

01:23:01.556 --> 01:23:07.393
You ... are the most
respected voice of that law.

01:23:07.445 --> 01:23:09.996
Will you take his judgment upon yourself?

01:23:16.571 --> 01:23:20.373
Find a way to put him before me.

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.896
May I come in?

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:52.959
This is Joanna.

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:58.464
She brings perfumed oils and
asks to anoint your hair.

01:23:58.630 --> 01:23:59.809
Bless you, Joanna.

01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:20.333
You come with a hidden purpose Joanna.

01:24:24.339 --> 01:24:26.840
I'm the wife of Chuza.

01:24:26.925 --> 01:24:28.792
Chief Steward of the Tetrarch.

01:24:33.432 --> 01:24:37.550
They speak of killing you, 
the Tetrarch, those of the Temple.

01:24:37.636 --> 01:24:39.769
And you came to warn me, why?

01:24:39.838 --> 01:24:42.222
My cousin was to be stoned.

01:24:42.307 --> 01:24:43.473
She lives because of you.

01:24:51.399 --> 01:24:52.982
Don't go to Jerusalem.

01:24:58.707 --> 01:24:59.989
I must.

01:25:37.162 --> 01:25:39.245
This is a house of prayer.

01:25:39.331 --> 01:25:40.396
This is my...

01:25:40.448 --> 01:25:42.615
- Get Malchus!
- Not a den of thieves.

01:25:43.902 --> 01:25:45.702
It is God's House.

01:25:45.754 --> 01:25:47.086
Down with the money lenders!

01:25:47.172 --> 01:25:48.288
Down with the money lenders!

01:25:49.958 --> 01:25:51.341
AAArrgh.

01:25:58.583 --> 01:26:00.550
Behold the King of the Jews!

01:26:03.254 --> 01:26:04.437
Turn out the guard.

01:26:05.307 --> 01:26:08.424
Oh no hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:26:19.437 --> 01:26:22.104
Behold the King of the Jews!

01:26:22.157 --> 01:26:23.940
Behold the King of the Jews.

01:26:23.992 --> 01:26:26.910
My house will be
called the house of prayer.

01:26:26.962 --> 01:26:31.247
You have made it a den of thieves.

01:26:31.299 --> 01:26:32.832
You'll die for this.

01:26:39.975 --> 01:26:44.844
Nazarene, order them to 
stop this blasphemous praise.

01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:46.012
Stop?

01:26:46.097 --> 01:26:48.631
If I stop the stones
themselves would cry out!

01:26:48.683 --> 01:26:50.016
Guards, arrest him!

01:26:50.101 --> 01:26:51.517
Arrest that man.

01:27:18.847 --> 01:27:20.763
Ahhh!!!

01:27:20.832 --> 01:27:22.062
Enough!

01:27:23.935 --> 01:27:25.351
Guards hold your place.

01:27:25.437 --> 01:27:27.687
...hold your place!
...hold your place!

01:27:27.772 --> 01:27:28.855
What I came to do,

01:27:30.842 --> 01:27:32.025
is done.

01:27:46.324 --> 01:27:47.657
Our impotence in dealing

01:27:47.709 --> 01:27:50.293
with this man will bring about
the distain of the Romans.

01:27:50.361 --> 01:27:53.212
He invalidates our authority
both in the temple

01:27:53.298 --> 01:27:54.747
and in Jerusalem.

01:27:54.833 --> 01:27:58.051
If he leaves, and returns 
a triumphant leader.

01:27:58.136 --> 01:28:02.705
Pilate may decide to deal
with him instead of us.

01:28:02.757 --> 01:28:05.207
Let's judge him here, in this room.

01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:07.727
- And stone him to death.
- How?

01:28:07.812 --> 01:28:09.512
The mob makes his arrest impossible.

01:28:09.564 --> 01:28:11.564
He's surrounded by
hundreds who venerate him.

01:28:15.236 --> 01:28:16.402
I have seen a weakness.

01:28:16.488 --> 01:28:19.405
Mmmm...

01:28:19.491 --> 01:28:21.324
Tell us.

01:28:21.392 --> 01:28:24.494
Betrayal, by one of his own.

01:28:24.562 --> 01:28:27.196
Impossible.
They worship him.

01:28:27.248 --> 01:28:28.531
Perhaps not all.

01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:34.620
Judas Iscariot.

01:28:36.041 --> 01:28:37.840
The tax collector.

01:28:37.909 --> 01:28:40.259
Wasn't sure you'd remember me,

01:28:40.345 --> 01:28:42.845
going as you go, seeing many faces.

01:28:42.914 --> 01:28:44.464
Few horses like this.

01:28:44.549 --> 01:28:47.083
Yes to be admired he is.

01:28:47.135 --> 01:28:50.019
You should have a fine horse, 
be finely mounted as befits

01:28:50.088 --> 01:28:52.438
those who serve a king.

01:28:52.524 --> 01:28:54.057
You were at the temple.

01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:56.392
In truth, no.

01:28:56.444 --> 01:28:57.777
I long for the rewards of heaven,

01:28:57.862 --> 01:29:01.064
but I take the coin
and let the credit go,

01:29:01.116 --> 01:29:05.151
and ignore the promises
of kingdoms yet to come.

01:29:05.236 --> 01:29:08.788
And facing what you face,
hearing the sighs of the dying

01:29:08.873 --> 01:29:12.125
on the hill of Golgotha.

01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:17.130
Where I in your place, my every
breath would tighten with fear.

01:29:20.418 --> 01:29:23.302
A horse such as this, costs what?

01:29:23.388 --> 01:29:26.472
A stallion of his blood he could
be had for 15 pieces of silver.

01:29:27.976 --> 01:29:31.344
But I also know a man who would
offer you 30 pieces of silver.

01:29:33.565 --> 01:29:34.814
In return for what?

01:29:37.635 --> 01:29:40.103
Willingness to choose life over death.

01:29:43.575 --> 01:29:45.274
Where would this man be found?

01:30:05.713 --> 01:30:08.131
I need to speak with Malchus.

01:30:08.183 --> 01:30:09.298
Asher sent me.

01:30:38.046 --> 01:30:39.662
I haven't much time.

01:30:41.466 --> 01:30:44.050
When and where can we find him alone?

01:30:44.135 --> 01:30:46.302
The others are always at his side.

01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:48.204
The 12.

01:30:48.256 --> 01:30:53.709
Or better said, 12 minus one.

01:30:53.761 --> 01:30:57.180
Tonight, we will eat the
Passover meal here in Jerusalem.

01:30:57.232 --> 01:30:58.347
Where?

01:30:58.399 --> 01:31:00.349
I don't yet know.

01:31:00.401 --> 01:31:02.268
A room.

01:31:02.353 --> 01:31:05.071
It was decided without me.

01:31:05.156 --> 01:31:10.693
So far I hear nothing
worth 30 pieces of silver.

01:31:10.745 --> 01:31:13.412
I'll leave that meal and come here.

01:31:15.917 --> 01:31:18.417
Doing this, you save your life.

01:31:19.954 --> 01:31:22.672
Yes.

01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:24.707
That must be why I did this.

01:32:24.053 --> 01:32:25.802
Everywhere there is talk of you.

01:32:25.888 --> 01:32:30.257
An Inn gave us food and lodging
and would accept no payment.

01:32:30.309 --> 01:32:33.677
My son is hailed for
bringing a message from God.

01:32:35.481 --> 01:32:36.980
And those of Nazareth.

01:32:37.066 --> 01:32:39.099
Believing you to be the Messiah? Yes.

01:32:40.185 --> 01:32:41.685
Some do.

01:32:41.770 --> 01:32:42.869
And you?

01:32:53.916 --> 01:32:56.816
So great will be my pride,

01:32:56.869 --> 01:32:59.836
when I hear you speak at the temple.

01:32:59.922 --> 01:33:01.121
I'll not speak there again.

01:33:03.459 --> 01:33:08.629
But on the road, 
many were coming to hear you.

01:33:08.681 --> 01:33:11.632
That's over now.

01:33:11.684 --> 01:33:16.803
I've come all this way
...you'll deny me that?

01:33:16.855 --> 01:33:19.439
The decision isn't mine.

01:33:19.508 --> 01:33:23.644
I can't speak of it with you.

01:33:23.696 --> 01:33:26.947
Mother, I have so longed for you.

01:33:27.015 --> 01:33:28.649
The pain of absence has been terrible.

01:33:31.453 --> 01:33:33.987
But now it's too late.

01:33:34.039 --> 01:33:36.823
Too late?

01:33:36.875 --> 01:33:38.659
What do you mean?

01:33:38.711 --> 01:33:40.577
James, take her to Nazareth.

01:33:40.663 --> 01:33:42.162
Have you lost your mind saying this?

01:33:42.214 --> 01:33:44.998
I beg you spare her from what must come.

01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:46.673
Where are you going?

01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:50.092
Jesus?

01:33:52.207 --> 01:33:53.974
Come, we must go....

01:34:17.333 --> 01:34:19.566
You wash our feet why?

01:34:19.618 --> 01:34:24.338
Call me Lord, and place me above you.

01:34:24.406 --> 01:34:26.906
I wash your feet to show that
no master is greater

01:34:26.959 --> 01:34:28.208
than his servant.

01:34:30.078 --> 01:34:33.380
And no messenger is greater
than the one who sends him.

01:34:33.432 --> 01:34:36.350
Come and eat what God has
blessed on this Passover night.

01:34:37.469 --> 01:34:39.936
God bless us.

01:34:40.022 --> 01:34:43.640
Start carving Matthew, carve it.

01:34:56.071 --> 01:34:58.038
Brothers, let us talk of what is written

01:34:58.106 --> 01:34:59.656
and what prophets have said.

01:35:00.909 --> 01:35:03.443
It's in the scripture.

01:35:03.495 --> 01:35:06.246
He who shares my bread, 
has lifted his heel against me.

01:35:11.003 --> 01:35:13.503
I tell you now, before it happens, 
so when it does happen,

01:35:13.589 --> 01:35:15.555
you know that I'm he.

01:35:15.624 --> 01:35:16.723
No one questions that.

01:35:16.792 --> 01:35:19.459
Many will.

01:35:19.511 --> 01:35:20.560
And one will betray me.

01:35:22.731 --> 01:35:24.264
How can you say this?

01:35:24.316 --> 01:35:25.482
I have been loyal.

01:35:25.567 --> 01:35:26.767
We've all been loyal.

01:35:26.819 --> 01:35:28.101
He's testing us again.

01:35:28.153 --> 01:35:31.104
Brothers, I'll be with
you only a little longer.

01:35:34.743 --> 01:35:36.076
Take what I've said,

01:35:36.144 --> 01:35:40.113
that in me you'll have peace
in a world of anger and despair.

01:35:40.165 --> 01:35:43.917
Take courage for I have overcome
the world, but where I now go,

01:35:43.985 --> 01:35:46.228
- you cannot follow.
- I'll follow.

01:35:46.922 --> 01:35:48.839
I'd lay down my life.

01:35:48.924 --> 01:35:50.874
Go to prison. To death.

01:35:50.959 --> 01:35:53.210
Peter this very night
before the cock has crowed,

01:35:53.295 --> 01:35:55.879
you will deny three
times that you know me.

01:35:55.964 --> 01:35:57.073
I tell you now.

01:36:00.886 --> 01:36:01.968
Where is Judas?

01:36:10.145 --> 01:36:11.862
The Garden of Gethsemane.

01:36:13.031 --> 01:36:14.614
They will go there to pray.

01:36:15.317 --> 01:36:17.984
It's dark in that garden.

01:36:18.036 --> 01:36:21.238
How will my men know which is him?

01:36:21.323 --> 01:36:22.656
I will greet him with a kiss.

01:36:27.496 --> 01:36:28.662
Later.

01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:47.764
Oh my darling.

01:36:47.850 --> 01:36:50.400
Not another dream of the Baptist.

01:36:50.486 --> 01:36:52.185
I can't sleep.

01:36:52.237 --> 01:36:57.157
Oh the rest I so desperately need, 
and then I awaken,

01:36:57.225 --> 01:36:59.109
there that thing is beside me.

01:36:59.194 --> 01:37:00.911
No. No it is gone.

01:37:00.996 --> 01:37:02.195
These are dreams.

01:37:02.247 --> 01:37:04.030
One of the servants
told me it wasn't found.

01:37:04.082 --> 01:37:05.532
It wasn't buried.

01:37:05.584 --> 01:37:06.867
The head!

01:37:06.919 --> 01:37:10.587
No. It was eaten by
jackals in the desert.

01:37:10.672 --> 01:37:13.039
His follower brings this horror.

01:37:13.091 --> 01:37:15.241
Jesus, takes revenge.

01:37:15.294 --> 01:37:17.460
Tell her the sorcery of the Nazarene

01:37:17.546 --> 01:37:20.347
will have an end.

01:37:20.415 --> 01:37:22.516
You tell me he will die too.

01:37:40.152 --> 01:37:44.270
Father take this cup from me.

01:37:44.323 --> 01:37:46.239
This bitter cup.

01:37:47.459 --> 01:37:50.210
If it's not possible that
this cup be taken away...

01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:56.249
Your will be done.

01:38:33.321 --> 01:38:34.838
So I'm betrayed with a kiss.

01:38:37.726 --> 01:38:38.792
Take me.

01:38:38.844 --> 01:38:39.843
Let them go.

01:38:39.928 --> 01:38:41.011
You don't give orders to me.

01:38:41.096 --> 01:38:42.178
Agh!

01:38:42.264 --> 01:38:43.680
Agh!

01:38:43.765 --> 01:38:45.515
Agh!

01:38:45.601 --> 01:38:46.800
Leave him.

01:38:46.852 --> 01:38:48.334
Grab the mad man.

01:38:48.387 --> 01:38:49.769
Bind his hands.

01:38:49.838 --> 01:38:51.054
Save yourselves.

01:38:51.139 --> 01:38:52.105
For me.

01:38:52.173 --> 01:38:54.641
You must live.

01:38:54.693 --> 01:38:55.775
Go!

01:39:31.146 --> 01:39:32.762
I'm going to Jerusalem.

01:39:32.848 --> 01:39:34.014
No my brother.

01:39:34.066 --> 01:39:35.882
They'll find you.
They'll kill you.

01:39:35.934 --> 01:39:36.999
I'm going.

01:40:10.703 --> 01:40:12.503
It's cold and the hour is late.

01:40:12.571 --> 01:40:14.505
And the matter urgent.

01:40:14.573 --> 01:40:15.923
The matter being?

01:40:16.008 --> 01:40:19.844
We've been told the temple guards
have arrested Jesus of Nazareth.

01:40:19.912 --> 01:40:21.212
An issue of your faith.

01:40:21.264 --> 01:40:24.632
An issue of law.

01:40:24.717 --> 01:40:26.717
Law beyond my provenance.

01:40:26.769 --> 01:40:30.721
Both our laws and yours violated.

01:40:30.773 --> 01:40:32.773
He's been taken to the house of Caiaphas,

01:40:32.859 --> 01:40:35.776
not to the temple and the
chamber of hewn stone.

01:40:35.862 --> 01:40:38.112
His trial will be unjust.

01:40:38.197 --> 01:40:40.364
Sometimes things are done for expediency.

01:40:40.432 --> 01:40:42.483
Cicero writing about your Roman law,

01:40:42.568 --> 01:40:46.287
claims where there is immorality
there can be no expediency.

01:40:46.372 --> 01:40:47.488
This is immoral.

01:40:47.573 --> 01:40:48.873
Send troops.

01:40:48.941 --> 01:40:50.291
Free him.

01:40:50.376 --> 01:40:52.276
Roman troops
to the home of a High Priest.

01:40:52.328 --> 01:40:54.211
Are you insane?

01:40:54.280 --> 01:41:00.251
Governor, I ask as a
devout Jew do not allow

01:41:00.303 --> 01:41:02.136
this man to be murdered.

01:41:03.422 --> 01:41:05.556
If he is stoned it is beyond my purview.

01:41:05.624 --> 01:41:06.690
They want him crucified.

01:41:09.262 --> 01:41:11.262
A punishment only I can pronounce.

01:41:14.934 --> 01:41:15.983
Ah..

01:41:17.436 --> 01:41:20.187
Will you?

01:41:22.241 --> 01:41:23.524
It's late and I am cold.

01:41:34.787 --> 01:41:36.820
You are accused of acts

01:41:36.873 --> 01:41:38.005
of sorcery.

01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:40.157
Spreading lies.

01:41:40.209 --> 01:41:42.042
Corrupting others.

01:41:42.128 --> 01:41:45.963
I spoke openly in synagogues, the temple.

01:41:46.015 --> 01:41:48.165
Places where Jews came to hear of God.

01:41:48.217 --> 01:41:51.135
They came to hear of God.

01:41:51.187 --> 01:41:53.137
The words you gave them came from Satan.

01:41:56.893 --> 01:41:59.610
Why not ask those who have heard me?

01:41:59.678 --> 01:42:01.645
They know what I said.

01:42:01.697 --> 01:42:02.696
Agh!

01:42:05.818 --> 01:42:07.701
This is the way
you answer the High Priest?

01:42:11.374 --> 01:42:11.989
Aghh!

01:42:12.041 --> 01:42:13.107
Aghh!

01:42:16.462 --> 01:42:17.461
I command you!

01:42:17.529 --> 01:42:18.662
Let us through.

01:42:18.714 --> 01:42:20.047
Let us through.

01:42:20.132 --> 01:42:21.165
Please! Make way!

01:42:23.336 --> 01:42:24.752
Open this!

01:42:24.837 --> 01:42:29.873
You truly claim you
are the son of the blessed one?

01:42:38.684 --> 01:42:40.017
I am.

01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:47.524
You have heard blasphemy from his lips.

01:42:47.576 --> 01:42:50.244
These words and more.

01:42:50.329 --> 01:42:52.363
His claim he's a prophet.

01:42:54.583 --> 01:42:55.783
Blindfold him.

01:43:03.342 --> 01:43:05.926
Give us a prophecy, oh Prophet Jesus.

01:43:10.299 --> 01:43:11.966
Who struck that blow?

01:43:12.051 --> 01:43:13.600
Prophets are all seeing.

01:43:13.686 --> 01:43:14.751
Stop!

01:43:15.587 --> 01:43:17.972
Stop this disgrace.

01:43:18.057 --> 01:43:20.557
You dare to interfere.

01:43:20.609 --> 01:43:23.811
Annas, we are shamed by what we see.

01:43:23.896 --> 01:43:28.699
If this ... this
cabal is to be called a trial

01:43:28.767 --> 01:43:31.485
then I demand that we are included.

01:43:31.570 --> 01:43:37.374
You are the two, this blasphemer

01:43:37.443 --> 01:43:41.045
will be judged by a majority.

01:43:42.081 --> 01:43:43.163
What's happening?

01:43:43.249 --> 01:43:46.550
Jesus is a criminal,
posing as the Messiah.

01:43:46.618 --> 01:43:48.335
Not a man who walks on the waters,

01:43:48.421 --> 01:43:50.954
who feeds the multitudes.

01:43:51.007 --> 01:43:52.389
You saw these wonders?

01:43:52.458 --> 01:43:55.292
Ask yourselves would
priests lay hands upon him

01:43:55.344 --> 01:43:57.177
if he were truly the Messiah?

01:43:57.263 --> 01:43:58.962
People are fooled by sorcery.

01:43:59.015 --> 01:44:02.266
You ... I've seen you with him before.

01:44:02.318 --> 01:44:04.268
No, I, I, I don't need this Nazarene.

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:05.469
It's too dangerous here, we should go.

01:44:05.521 --> 01:44:06.186
No.

01:44:06.272 --> 01:44:07.337
Come on Simon.

01:44:09.475 --> 01:44:11.825
She says you're a follower.

01:44:11.911 --> 01:44:12.976
She's wrong.

01:44:13.029 --> 01:44:14.862
Deny it under oath.

01:44:14.947 --> 01:44:16.530
I deny him, now enough.

01:44:27.927 --> 01:44:29.376
The vote is against you.

01:44:37.770 --> 01:44:39.720
Make way! Make way!

01:45:24.817 --> 01:45:26.934
These goats, where do you take them?

01:45:27.019 --> 01:45:29.269
To the temple.

01:45:29.355 --> 01:45:30.454
For sacrifice?

01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:37.945
He leads them to death,
he's their betrayer.

01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:39.363
Yeah...

01:45:40.282 --> 01:45:43.534
I want that rope, just the rope.

01:45:45.037 --> 01:45:46.136
I'll pay.

01:45:46.205 --> 01:45:47.271
Here.

01:45:48.907 --> 01:45:51.642
Unless I lead him the heard will scatter.

01:45:51.710 --> 01:45:55.179
Scatter and be saved.

01:45:55.247 --> 01:45:56.547
I need the rope.

01:45:56.599 --> 01:46:03.353
Here ...buy more goats, ten times these.

01:46:03.422 --> 01:46:06.356
Ten times ten.

01:46:06.425 --> 01:46:07.891
Or a horse.

01:46:09.595 --> 01:46:13.313
Yes, now you imagine it, owning a horse.

01:46:16.802 --> 01:46:18.068
I know the feeling.

01:46:59.811 --> 01:47:03.580
Governor, you'll not open the gate?

01:47:03.649 --> 01:47:05.815
We've brought a criminal for judgment.

01:47:05.868 --> 01:47:08.318
Take him and judge him under your law.

01:47:16.579 --> 01:47:17.661
He won't hear the charge.

01:47:17.713 --> 01:47:18.995
Silence I say!

01:47:19.048 --> 01:47:20.714
He should be executed for speaking

01:47:20.799 --> 01:47:22.933
against the rule of Caesar.

01:47:23.001 --> 01:47:24.935
Claiming he is King of the Jews.

01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:30.440
Are you King of the Jews?

01:47:31.527 --> 01:47:34.811
My kingdom is not of this world.

01:47:34.863 --> 01:47:37.147
I hear no support for your charges.

01:47:37.199 --> 01:47:40.951
His cryptic speech is but a ploy.

01:47:41.019 --> 01:47:42.819
He is a criminal.

01:47:42.871 --> 01:47:44.488
We have witnesses.

01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:46.039
He began his crimes in Galilee.

01:47:46.125 --> 01:47:48.575
Galilee?

01:47:48.661 --> 01:47:51.245
Then take him to the Tetrarch of Galilee.

01:47:51.330 --> 01:47:52.796
He should judge this man.

01:48:08.981 --> 01:48:10.046
There he is again.

01:48:12.067 --> 01:48:13.267
He is one of them.

01:48:14.486 --> 01:48:16.153
I don't know that man, you're mistaken.

01:48:16.221 --> 01:48:18.155
You're lying.

01:48:25.698 --> 01:48:28.165
All is as he said.

01:48:29.901 --> 01:48:31.752
Where is God's army of angels?

01:48:40.412 --> 01:48:42.596
What do you hear?

01:48:42.681 --> 01:48:44.748
Caiaphas is bringing him here.

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:45.966
Hearing Jesus comes from Galilee,

01:48:46.051 --> 01:48:48.552
Pilate wants his blood on my hands.

01:48:48.604 --> 01:48:51.488
He wants my name to curse
the lips of every Jew.

01:48:51.557 --> 01:48:53.089
Sillaeus, leave us.

01:48:53.142 --> 01:48:54.174
Go!

01:48:59.264 --> 01:49:01.531
I will deal no more with holy men.

01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:04.401
I'm a stone wall. Herodias.

01:49:04.453 --> 01:49:06.403
I'll not argue.

01:49:06.455 --> 01:49:09.956
Jesus threatens Priests, 
but other than a mob hailing him

01:49:10.042 --> 01:49:14.044
King of the Jews, he is no threat to you.

01:49:14.112 --> 01:49:17.381
His death need not be upon our house.

01:49:17.449 --> 01:49:19.549
I cannot simply hide.

01:49:22.805 --> 01:49:25.422
Face him.

01:49:25.474 --> 01:49:31.645
Let the mob see who is truly
fit to be King of the Jews.

01:49:56.755 --> 01:49:59.956
I'm told you work miracles.

01:50:00.008 --> 01:50:01.842
Do something.

01:50:01.927 --> 01:50:04.294
Anything wondrous.

01:50:04.346 --> 01:50:05.929
Make bread fall from the heavens.

01:50:07.549 --> 01:50:09.383
Feed us a morning meal.

01:50:09.468 --> 01:50:11.501
My preference is lentils and barley.

01:50:14.973 --> 01:50:16.273
Do something!

01:50:20.863 --> 01:50:22.479
A miracle could save you.

01:50:26.819 --> 01:50:31.705
It is said that Simon
the Magus could fly. Hm?

01:50:33.058 --> 01:50:36.827
But, can Jesus the Nazarene fly?

01:50:36.879 --> 01:50:38.695
Release him!

01:50:38.747 --> 01:50:41.214
Let him be born aloft.

01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:42.532
Go! Shh...

01:50:42.584 --> 01:50:45.034
Oh, oh look, look,
there he, there he goes.

01:50:45.087 --> 01:50:47.053
No. I'm wrong.

01:50:47.139 --> 01:50:48.555
A bird.

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:49.723
Not Jesus.

01:50:52.644 --> 01:50:56.179
He makes no wonders
but is hailed as King.

01:50:56.231 --> 01:50:58.064
Let him be adorned as a King.

01:50:59.735 --> 01:51:01.601
Come, come.

01:51:07.075 --> 01:51:09.910
The purple robe of royal office.

01:51:11.697 --> 01:51:14.614
No King should go forth without a staff.

01:51:31.717 --> 01:51:32.749
Patience.

01:51:32.801 --> 01:51:33.683
Patience.

01:51:33.752 --> 01:51:36.019
Nothing has been forgotten.

01:51:43.061 --> 01:51:43.944
Agh!

01:51:44.029 --> 01:51:45.278
Agh.

01:51:45.364 --> 01:51:46.613
Agh.

01:51:54.990 --> 01:51:58.274
I give you a royal
threat to Caesar Tiberius,

01:51:58.327 --> 01:52:01.661
bring him back to the Romans
to be judged for Sedition.

01:52:01.747 --> 01:52:03.330
You cannot dismiss us.

01:52:03.415 --> 01:52:05.081
He expects you to deal with this.

01:52:05.133 --> 01:52:09.118
Bring him back to Pilate, 
I'm done with him.

01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:17.344
Why must you cater to these Priests?

01:52:17.429 --> 01:52:18.645
The Tetrarch?

01:52:18.730 --> 01:52:21.348
Without them I cannot
easily govern these people.

01:52:21.433 --> 01:52:23.900
Kill him, and you'll bear 
the wrath of his following.

01:52:23.969 --> 01:52:25.318
- I - must do something.

01:52:25.404 --> 01:52:26.769
I cannot simply set him loose.

01:52:32.644 --> 01:52:33.727
GUARDS!

01:52:54.499 --> 01:52:55.599
Scourge him.

01:52:59.938 --> 01:53:01.021
What's happening?

01:53:03.108 --> 01:53:03.974
Let me through!

01:53:04.026 --> 01:53:05.058
Master.

01:53:20.242 --> 01:53:21.524
Agh.

01:53:21.577 --> 01:53:25.028
His cry.

01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:25.712
Agh.

01:53:25.797 --> 01:53:28.798
My baby boy.

01:53:28.867 --> 01:53:32.385
Oh my baby boy. Ahhh!!

01:53:33.922 --> 01:53:35.371
Agh!

01:53:35.424 --> 01:53:36.222
No! No!

01:53:36.308 --> 01:53:37.340
You mustn't.

01:53:37.392 --> 01:53:39.042
Agh!

01:53:39.094 --> 01:53:41.595
Agh. Agh. Agh.

01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:43.229
Agh!

01:53:45.517 --> 01:53:46.816
Agh! Agh... Agh...

01:53:49.321 --> 01:53:50.820
Agh!

01:53:50.889 --> 01:53:52.388
Make the guard stop!

01:53:52.441 --> 01:53:54.157
No!

01:53:54.225 --> 01:53:55.992
Please!

01:53:56.061 --> 01:53:58.495
Agh!

01:53:58.563 --> 01:53:59.996
Agh.!

01:54:00.065 --> 01:54:02.231
Aghhh!!

01:54:02.284 --> 01:54:04.067
Ahhh!!

01:54:04.119 --> 01:54:05.335
Agh!

01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:24.688
Scourging is punishment enough.

01:54:24.756 --> 01:54:26.473
He may not survive. Many don't.

01:54:26.558 --> 01:54:30.443
End this threat to order.

01:54:30.529 --> 01:54:31.561
End it.

01:54:32.931 --> 01:54:37.067
Let the death of this one man
prevent the deaths of many.

01:55:03.145 --> 01:55:04.811
- Crucify him..

01:55:04.896 --> 01:55:07.797
No!

01:55:07.849 --> 01:55:10.233
NO!

01:55:23.281 --> 01:55:25.782
Behold Jesus...

01:55:30.255 --> 01:55:34.791
Ohhh.. Ahh!

01:55:41.332 --> 01:55:43.166
Betrayed.

01:55:43.218 --> 01:55:45.001
Humiliated.

01:55:45.053 --> 01:55:49.305
And soon agony beyond
what you can imagine..

01:55:49.357 --> 01:55:50.557
Oh oh.

01:55:50.642 --> 01:55:54.844
Is this the glory of God you bragged of?

01:55:54.896 --> 01:55:55.945
Glory.

01:55:58.900 --> 01:56:00.283
As I expected.

01:56:00.351 --> 01:56:01.484
No.

01:56:01.536 --> 01:56:03.570
The temple is God's glory.

01:56:08.827 --> 01:56:10.710
Aaah, God's glory is love.

01:56:13.749 --> 01:56:18.501
To know love is to know God.

01:56:22.424 --> 01:56:24.540
Give him that...
scort..

01:56:24.593 --> 01:56:26.760
Then Love me.

01:56:26.845 --> 01:56:28.845
Sweet Jesus.

01:56:30.265 --> 01:56:32.398
I do love you.

01:56:32.484 --> 01:56:33.733
I do love you.

01:56:33.819 --> 01:56:35.568
I want to hear rage from your lips.

01:56:35.654 --> 01:56:38.438
Hear it as you hang nailed to the wood.

01:56:38.523 --> 01:56:41.608
You will vomit forth a ... a
hatred that will put a lie

01:56:41.693 --> 01:56:42.909
to your words.

01:56:44.529 --> 01:56:45.561
Why are you afraid?

01:56:50.502 --> 01:56:54.170
Here is a false prophet.

01:56:54.239 --> 01:56:56.589
A false king.

01:56:56.675 --> 01:56:57.707
Mock him.

01:56:57.759 --> 01:56:59.425
For his lies.

01:56:59.511 --> 01:57:03.379
Come ... take joy at his suffering.

01:57:03.431 --> 01:57:07.250
Oh ... great king.

01:57:07.302 --> 01:57:09.519
Great prophet.

01:57:09.587 --> 01:57:11.754
Mock him.

01:57:11.807 --> 01:57:13.439
Go on!

01:57:13.525 --> 01:57:15.108
Come.

01:57:15.193 --> 01:57:16.392
Move!

01:57:16.444 --> 01:57:17.143
Agh!

01:57:17.229 --> 01:57:18.394
Move!

01:57:21.066 --> 01:57:24.033
Honor the King of the Jews!

01:57:35.797 --> 01:57:41.050
No! No! No!

01:57:59.521 --> 01:58:01.321
Agh!

01:58:01.406 --> 01:58:02.805
Agh.

01:58:02.858 --> 01:58:04.774
Agh.

01:58:04.826 --> 01:58:07.944
Agh.

01:58:07.996 --> 01:58:10.413
Agh!

01:58:10.481 --> 01:58:13.149
Agh. Agh.

01:58:13.201 --> 01:58:15.585
Agh! Agh.

01:58:15.653 --> 01:58:17.820
Agh. Agh. Agh. Agh.

01:58:17.873 --> 01:58:22.542
Forgive them ... they
know not what they do.

01:58:24.996 --> 01:58:27.680
Agh.

01:58:27.766 --> 01:58:29.716
Agh.

01:58:29.801 --> 01:58:32.668
Agh.

01:58:32.721 --> 01:58:36.055
Agh!! Agh!!

01:58:45.984 --> 01:58:47.683
He spoke.

01:58:47.736 --> 01:58:48.785
He cursed you.

01:58:48.853 --> 01:58:49.903
No.

01:58:49.988 --> 01:58:51.487
He asked his God to forgive us.

01:59:07.038 --> 01:59:13.810
Of all his followers,
only you ... of all of them,

01:59:13.878 --> 01:59:17.313
only you?

01:59:17.382 --> 01:59:21.217
Peter claims he can
see no more of his pain.

01:59:21.269 --> 01:59:23.403
The others fear for their lives.

01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:43.172
Agh.

01:59:43.241 --> 01:59:46.676
Agh.

01:59:46.744 --> 01:59:48.628
Why have you forsaken me?

01:59:52.717 --> 01:59:57.387
If his father has forsaken
him, we are all forsaken.

02:00:48.380 --> 02:00:53.851
Aghhh!

02:01:10.402 --> 02:01:11.869
It is finished.

02:01:20.129 --> 02:01:23.931
Gasp. Aaaaah.

02:01:34.694 --> 02:01:35.792
He said it's finished.

02:02:09.366 --> 02:02:10.748
My son...

02:02:31.470 --> 02:02:34.104
I am Nicodemus.

02:02:34.189 --> 02:02:39.976
And this is Joseph of Arimathea.

02:02:40.062 --> 02:02:45.115
We offer a shroud, 
and we have a tomb for Jesus.

02:03:58.390 --> 02:04:01.008
I thought this would end
as you said it would end.

02:04:01.076 --> 02:04:02.058
It is ended.

02:04:02.144 --> 02:04:03.894
All I ask is for assurance of that.

02:04:03.979 --> 02:04:05.112
Certainty that...

02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:06.279
What that he will not reappear?

02:04:06.348 --> 02:04:07.731
Of course not.
All I ask...

02:04:07.816 --> 02:04:10.016
Enough.

02:04:10.068 --> 02:04:11.284
Enough.

02:04:17.075 --> 02:04:19.459
Do not tell me that
Priest delays our journey.

02:04:19.528 --> 02:04:22.712
We'll be on the
road to Caesarea as planned.

02:04:22.798 --> 02:04:24.381
What brought him here?

02:04:24.466 --> 02:04:25.832
Fear.

02:04:25.884 --> 02:04:27.551
The man is dead.

02:04:27.636 --> 02:04:30.003
What more could he want?

02:04:30.055 --> 02:04:33.640
He wants the
tomb guarded by Roman soldiers.

02:04:33.708 --> 02:04:36.476
He, of all people, worries the Nazarene

02:04:36.545 --> 02:04:37.978
will return from the dead.

02:04:38.046 --> 02:04:39.596
He claims concern that the followers

02:04:39.682 --> 02:04:42.600
of Jesus will take the body in
order to make it appear

02:04:42.684 --> 02:04:45.218
that he has risen.

02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:46.903
Which do you believe?

02:04:46.989 --> 02:04:48.188
I believe that guarding that tomb

02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:50.023
is a waste of Roman soldiers' efforts.

02:04:54.696 --> 02:04:56.196
Let's begin our journey.

02:06:10.305 --> 02:06:15.942
Breathy Laugh

02:06:38.433 --> 02:06:39.599
Mmmm!

02:07:52.457 --> 02:07:53.456
Yes.

02:07:53.542 --> 02:07:55.508
I am Simon.

02:07:55.577 --> 02:07:58.962
Called by you, Peter,
the rock of your faith.

02:07:59.047 --> 02:08:01.548
And I will be your fisher of men.

02:08:06.304 --> 02:08:08.688
He has come!

02:08:08.757 --> 02:08:10.357
Come back to us!

02:08:17.098 --> 02:08:18.565
Yes....

02:08:26.208 --> 02:08:28.491
According to early Christian tradition,

02:08:28.577 --> 02:08:31.411
Simon took the mission of Jesus to Rome

02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:34.214
where he formalised the nascent
Christian church.

02:08:35.851 --> 02:08:38.985
The Romans sentenced him to death

02:08:39.054 --> 02:08:42.589
it is claimed he asked to be
crucified upside down

02:08:42.641 --> 02:08:46.125
so that his death would not
be the equal of Jesus.

02:08:46.961 --> 02:08:51.765
The Romans granted his wish
early writings speak of James

02:08:51.817 --> 02:08:55.502
preaching of Jesus in the
Jerusalem Temple

02:08:55.570 --> 02:08:57.670
it's said he was stoned to death.

02:08:58.407 --> 02:09:03.193
Supposedly for challenging the
Temple's high priests

02:09:03.278 --> 02:09:06.613
the fates of other disciples are
consigned to legend

02:09:06.665 --> 02:09:08.615
and apocryphal texts.

02:09:08.667 --> 02:09:10.950
Andrew was crucified in Greece

02:09:12.153 --> 02:09:14.587
Thomas was speared to death in India

02:09:15.624 --> 02:09:17.891
Simon sawed in half in persia.

02:09:18.827 --> 02:09:21.044
Matthew murdered in Ethiopia.

02:09:23.632 --> 02:09:28.301
According to tradition, John 
was not martyred but spent time

02:09:28.353 --> 02:09:32.388
in exile on Patmos and lived to ninety.

02:09:33.809 --> 02:09:37.527
Scholars debate the authorship
of the Gospel of John,

02:09:38.363 --> 02:09:41.281
held by some to be an eye witness account

02:09:41.349 --> 02:09:42.782
of the life of Jesus.

02:09:45.704 --> 02:09:48.788
Antipas continued pressing
Rome to be named king

02:09:48.857 --> 02:09:51.491
until his efforts offended
the new emperor,

02:09:51.543 --> 02:09:56.963
Caligula Antipas and Herodia
were exiled to Gaul,

02:09:57.031 --> 02:09:58.832
where they died in obscurity.

02:10:00.919 --> 02:10:05.672
Pontius Pilate was recalled 
to Rome, while Joseph Caiaphas,

02:10:05.724 --> 02:10:10.810
without his roman ally, 
lost his position within the temple

02:10:10.879 --> 02:10:15.899
whereas the story of Jesus,
a humble carpenter of Nazareth,

02:10:15.984 --> 02:10:19.068
gave birth to one of the
world's foremost religions.

02:10:23.325 --> 02:10:29.195
Today there are more than two
billion christians worldwide.
