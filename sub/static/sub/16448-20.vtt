WEBVTT

00:00.368 --> 00:01.902
( Laughing )

00:01.935 --> 00:04.072
Your church really knows
how to throw a fundraiser.

00:04.105 --> 00:05.539
That was a fun night.
Yeah.

00:05.573 --> 00:07.041
Yeah, and I think
we all learned

00:07.075 --> 00:08.509
who the master of
ring toss is, huh?

00:08.542 --> 00:09.810
I'm telling you.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.180
Hey, if they start
a church league,
I'm going pro.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.514
All right,
I wouldn't be too proud.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.683
You pushed a 14-year-old kid
out of the way to win that.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.619
Oh. First of all, she was
taller than me, okay?
Mm-hmm.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.388
And second of all, she was
throwing mad elbows.

00:20.421 --> 00:21.622
She was getting in there --

00:21.655 --> 00:25.293
She was going nuts. All right?
I regret nothing.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.961
I want to apologize for
making everyone leave early

00:27.995 --> 00:29.397
and miss the raffle

00:29.430 --> 00:31.599
because this one couldn't keep
his eyes open.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.134
I wasn't sleeping.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.735
Please, Mott, I was
eating my hot dog,

00:34.768 --> 00:37.671
I look over, you're like...
( Snoring )

00:37.705 --> 00:40.040
( Makes barking sound )

00:40.074 --> 00:42.376
All right, all right,
I'm exhausted.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.278
Last night, the kids took
my sleep apnea mask,

00:44.312 --> 00:46.380
filled it with juice --
I almost drowned.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.752
Yeah, the kids did that.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.755
It looks like the church
raised a lot of money.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.125
And, Kev, I hear that you've
been doing
some volunteer work.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.526
You're building
a playground?

00:58.559 --> 00:59.927
Didi, no. Didi, please --
( Huffs )

00:59.960 --> 01:01.762
You know what it is,
Didi, is...

01:01.795 --> 01:03.131
Okay, I'm gonna put on
some coffee.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.133
-I can't hear this again.
-I'll help you.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.935
All right, anyway, see,
most people,

01:07.968 --> 01:10.571
they just sit around
waiting for change.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.340
But it's the few of us,
like myself,

01:12.373 --> 01:16.076
who actually...
make it happen.

01:16.110 --> 01:19.347
It ain't exactly
Habitat for Humanity.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.814
You're putting together
a swing set.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.316
Oh --
( Cellphone ringing )

01:22.350 --> 01:24.518
Hold on a second. ( Groans )

01:24.552 --> 01:26.220
Hello?

01:26.254 --> 01:27.721
Father Philip,
what's happening?

01:27.755 --> 01:30.057
You gotta be kidding me.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.426
That's unbelievable.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.129
Well, God bless you.
God bless you.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.264
God bless you.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.366
Hey, take it down a notch.
No, no, no.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.801
He's got allergies.
He's sneezing like crazy.

01:40.834 --> 01:43.070
Okay, well, I gotta let
'em know. That is incredible.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.572
Thank you, Father. See ya.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.507
You guys won the grand prize
at the raffle.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.675
What?
You gotta be kidding me.

01:47.708 --> 01:48.976
Yes!
Wait a minute, what'd we win?

01:49.009 --> 01:50.678
The prize, get the prize.
( Stammering )

01:50.711 --> 01:51.812
Ooh, what'd we --

01:51.845 --> 01:53.481
"All-expense-paid weekend
for four people

01:53.514 --> 01:55.883
at the Lux Resort and Spa!"
( Laughing )

01:55.916 --> 01:57.618
Ooh!
Oh, look. Hold on!

01:57.651 --> 01:58.852
Look at that, look at that.

01:58.886 --> 02:01.289
Japanese steakhouse, massages,
all included.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.590
Ooh!

02:02.623 --> 02:04.792
Ooh, I'm gonna get
one of those
deep tissue massages all over.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.761
And I'm gonna get -- I'm gonna
get the paraffin
foot treatments

02:07.795 --> 02:10.030
to make my feet all nice
and soft.

02:10.063 --> 02:12.166
Ooh, good, baby, 'cause
right now it feels like

02:12.200 --> 02:14.968
you're wearing
golf shoes to bed.

02:15.002 --> 02:17.137
Oh, you wanna play that game?

02:17.171 --> 02:19.173
Let's talk about
your shoulder fat.

02:19.207 --> 02:21.108
No.
Come on, we good, we good.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.643
Yeah, I thought so.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.044
You know what, Kev?

02:24.077 --> 02:25.779
Thanks for talking me
into buying that ticket.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.048
What? You only bought
one ticket?

02:28.081 --> 02:30.017
Wow, we bought 50,
but, uh, hey,

02:30.050 --> 02:33.120
at least we won
a rubber basketball.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.755
It's Spongetech, okay?

02:34.788 --> 02:36.990
And I would've won a lot more,
but my water pistol jammed.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.326
Oh, here we go.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.261
No, I'm not saying
Father Daniel runs
a rigged game.

02:40.294 --> 02:43.497
That's between him and God,
but it was rigged.

02:44.832 --> 02:49.203
* I am not your ordinary guy

02:50.304 --> 02:51.539
-Hey, babe.
-Hey.

02:51.572 --> 02:52.973
Ooh, what are you makin'?

02:53.006 --> 02:57.010
It started as a BLT but, uh,
we ran out of L and T.

02:57.044 --> 03:00.113
So, uh...

03:00.147 --> 03:01.549
I'm just making a BM.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.353
-It's a bacon and mayonnaise.
-Oh.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.020
Hey, I'm gonna go
to Marshalls later

03:07.054 --> 03:09.523
and get us new suits
for the spa this weekend.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.191
I already have my Jets one.
It's very comfortable.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.026
-I like it.
-Oh, honey,
that's 20 years old.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.862
All the inside netting
is gone.

03:14.895 --> 03:18.232
You're welcome, ladies.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.568
Oh, and has Goody given us
the official invite yet?

03:20.601 --> 03:21.802
Uh, no. You know what it is?

03:21.835 --> 03:23.136
I think he wants to
surprise us.
Really?

03:23.170 --> 03:25.273
He said he's going to
come over
and borrow a "nail gun."

03:25.306 --> 03:26.874
Oh.
You know what it is?
I think he didn't want

03:26.907 --> 03:28.175
to say it in front
of the Motts last night.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.910
Oh, no. Of course.
That'd be awkward.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.645
But I mean, the Motts
have to understand.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.847
It's only room
for two couples,
and we bought the tickets

03:33.881 --> 03:35.148
to the fundraiser.

03:35.182 --> 03:36.817
You know, and, look,
we're their best friends.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.852
Yeah, um, okay, I'm gonna go
check with Kendra and Chale

03:38.886 --> 03:40.254
and make sure that
they're all good to watch

03:40.288 --> 03:41.455
the kids this weekend.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.956
Okay, hey, but there was only
one package of bacon,

03:42.990 --> 03:45.426
so don't tell them
about my BM.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.796
Might want to rename that.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.832
( Knocks )
Hey, man. Oh!

03:51.865 --> 03:53.667
-Hey.
-You got that nail gun?

03:53.701 --> 03:56.069
Oh, yeah. The, uh,
"the nail gun,"

03:56.103 --> 03:58.071
it's "in the shed."
( Chuckles )

03:58.105 --> 04:00.474
All right, "cool."

04:00.508 --> 04:02.876
Uh, I'm gonna go grab that
and I'll catch you later.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.712
Okay, hey, I just wanna say
congratulations

04:04.745 --> 04:06.447
on the spa weekend again.
That's the way to go.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.582
Thanks, man. You know,
Didi is over the moon.

04:08.616 --> 04:09.883
We needed it.
Oh, yeah.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.385
All right, dawg,
I got Layla in the car.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.920
Hey, let me ask you --
So wait, it's like --

04:12.953 --> 04:14.722
it was four people, right,
I think, going...

04:14.755 --> 04:15.989
Yeah, we're taking the Motts.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.292
Hey, thanks for the nail gun.
Hit you next week.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.563
( Knock on door )

04:22.596 --> 04:25.333
Come in.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.767
Hey there, neighbor.
Hey.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.201
I need to borrow some milk.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.404
My girlfriend is
making oliebollen.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.239
You make it without milk,
you know what you got?

04:32.272 --> 04:34.975
Regular bollen?

04:36.276 --> 04:39.380
All right, you heard
that joke before.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.281
( Singsongy ) Hey!
Hey.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.551
Hi.
Oh. Hey, Rootger.

04:43.584 --> 04:44.918
-I'm borrowing some milk.
-Okay.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.254
Doink.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.422
Hey.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.690
Hey.
( Door closes )

04:49.723 --> 04:52.159
You know, I almost called
Didi twice today,

04:52.192 --> 04:53.727
and then I stopped myself.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.463
I'm not over this, you know?

04:55.496 --> 04:59.199
But I was thinking,
we just need
to find another couple.

04:59.232 --> 05:01.335
Rootger's got a girlfriend

05:01.369 --> 05:03.904
and they're about to
make oliebollen.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.039
You know, so maybe we can
hang with them.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.475
Rootger's girlfriend

05:07.508 --> 05:09.543
takes photographs of garbage
in the rain.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.912
I've seen her do it
more than once.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.248
Do you know what our mistake
was here?

05:15.282 --> 05:18.586
Is that we put all of
our friend eggs in one basket.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.421
It's the Goody and Mott
basket.

05:20.454 --> 05:23.123
Yes, we made ourselves
a Goody omelet...

05:23.156 --> 05:27.194
with a side of tater Motts.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.097
-Clever.
-Right?

05:30.130 --> 05:31.399
Yeah.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.434
But all we got was
eggs benedict.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.102
Oh. Very good, sweetheart.

05:35.135 --> 05:38.305
-Yeah. You get it, though?
-I get it.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.340
So...if they think we're gonna
be crying here all day

05:40.374 --> 05:42.576
by ourselves, you know,
the yolk's on them.

05:42.610 --> 05:45.078
Okay, that's -- it's enough.
That's enough.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.880
I'm just looking on
the sunny side of things.
Stop.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.916
Okay, that was the last one.
That was the last one!
Stop it. Done.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.418
-One more for the shell of it?
-No. No.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.652
I gotta just
throw it out there.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.387
I'm just gonna throw it
out there.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.322
Okay, I'm out. I'm out.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.690
And, you know, by the way,

05:56.724 --> 05:58.559
it's not like we don't
have other friends.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.327
We got a ton of friends,
all right?
Yeah.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.396
We're very outgoing,
popular people.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.597
Absolutely.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.065
You know,
I got high school buddies,

06:05.098 --> 06:06.567
I got friends from the force.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.068
This guy at the bagel shop
right now,

06:08.101 --> 06:09.770
I know he's dying to
hang out with us.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.004
Well, should we call him?

06:11.038 --> 06:14.374
No, I don't know his name.
I know he likes...

06:14.408 --> 06:17.177
He likes poppy seeds.
I know that.
Okay. All right.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.479
But you know what?
All we gotta do

06:18.512 --> 06:20.180
is we just gotta get
in touch with some people,

06:20.213 --> 06:21.949
and we gotta make
things happens, right?

06:21.982 --> 06:23.617
-I like that. Frank!
-What?

06:23.651 --> 06:25.819
No, that's the poppy seed
guy's name is Frank.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.021
No, it's not Frank. That's
the guy who works at the deli.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.758
I love that guy.
That guy's good.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.260
Hey, Lisa. It's Donna Gable.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.663
Listen, um, Kevin and I,
we're having a dinner party

06:35.696 --> 06:37.264
and we want you and --

06:37.297 --> 06:39.199
He left you?

06:39.232 --> 06:42.069
( Gasps ) Oh.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.404
Oh, well, honey, that is not
your fault.

06:44.438 --> 06:47.708
I guess that --
that really says a lot
about Mark, huh?

06:47.741 --> 06:50.310
And your sister, yeah.

06:52.913 --> 06:57.718
So listen, do you have
their number?

07:02.155 --> 07:04.257
I'm out of bullets.
How'd you do?

07:04.291 --> 07:07.495
No friends, but I got Chinese
coming in 30 minutes.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.101
Hello, hello.

07:14.134 --> 07:17.004
Hey! What are you crazy kids
doing tonight?

07:17.037 --> 07:20.474
You're gonna hit the clubs,
a little vaping, huh?

07:20.508 --> 07:23.477
Uh, no, no. We were just about
to watch a movie.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.646
You need something?
A movie. I could do that.

07:25.679 --> 07:26.880
Love a movie.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.348
We could make up a big batch
of popcorn,

07:28.381 --> 07:30.584
get some blankies, you know,
make a night of it.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.553
Okay, what's going on?

07:32.586 --> 07:36.356
All right, well,
due to circumstances

07:36.389 --> 07:39.827
outside of our control,
we are temporarily

07:39.860 --> 07:41.795
a little short in
the friend bucket.

07:41.829 --> 07:45.332
Have you tried
the Internet?

07:45.365 --> 07:48.769
It -- it's where people
make friends nowadays.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.903
Even couples.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.605
Loser couples, yeah.

07:51.639 --> 07:54.007
Yeah, but, honey, I mean,
it's not such a terrible idea.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.408
We could try it.
Eh...

07:55.442 --> 07:56.744
Yeah. Yeah, give it a shot.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.378
You know, and if you have
nothing else to do tonight,

07:58.411 --> 08:00.213
you can just come and watch
the movie with us.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.783
Okay. All right, thanks.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.184
All right,
what are we watching?
Yeah.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.520
Oh, it's great.
It's called "Snow Kisses."

08:06.554 --> 08:09.489
It's the true story
of a disabled Eskimo boy

08:09.523 --> 08:12.392
who befriends a family
of harp seals.

08:12.425 --> 08:13.594
I am out.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.896
Ooh, me, too.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.097
**

08:17.130 --> 08:19.399
One of the benefits
of being retired is

08:19.432 --> 08:21.401
I get to do much more
charity work.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.270
I don't know if I've mentioned
the playground

08:23.303 --> 08:24.872
that I'm in
the process of building.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.106
You did.
A couple times.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.908
Yeah.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.944
By the way, you guys,
the pizza
at that Enzo's restaurant

08:30.978 --> 08:32.145
was delicious.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.380
Oh, hey --
Good call.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.849
Show a little loyalty
to Vito's, hon, come on.

08:35.883 --> 08:39.086
Oh, that's our favorite pizza
place out on Shelter Island.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.188
Ooh, that's pretty far
to go for pizza, huh?

08:41.221 --> 08:44.191
Not really. Not if we take our
boat, right? About 30 minutes.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.196
You guys have a boat?

08:49.229 --> 08:51.231
Oh, yeah.
We pull up to the dock,

08:51.264 --> 08:53.100
Vito brings the pie
right out to you.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.768
You eat pizza on the boat?

08:54.802 --> 08:57.037
-Yeah.
-Yep.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.272
That's literally -- that's
the dream I have every --

08:59.306 --> 09:01.742
pretty much every night,
I would say, right?

09:01.775 --> 09:03.744
-It's big for him.
-It is big.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.412
I see you guys
are low on wine,

09:05.445 --> 09:07.047
so why don't we go
open another bottle?

09:07.080 --> 09:08.816
Yeah, absolutely.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.483
You know that, right, honey?
With the Captain's hat?
No, I know that dream.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.920
You talk about that dream
all the time.

09:13.854 --> 09:16.423
They have a boat.
I like them.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.125
You see what happens when you
roll up your sleeves

09:18.158 --> 09:19.593
and you do not settle?

09:19.627 --> 09:22.262
Oh, seems like
things are going very nicely

09:22.295 --> 09:23.597
with your new friends.

09:23.631 --> 09:26.266
Yes, and thank you, Chale,
for suggesting that website.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.969
Actually, I didn't even
use Chale's website.
No?

09:29.002 --> 09:30.570
'Cause there was another
website kept popping up,

09:30.604 --> 09:31.972
so I clicked on it --
it was, uh,

09:32.005 --> 09:33.974
it was coupleslifestyle.com
or something.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.309
I don't know.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.979
I'm not familiar
with that one. Mm.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.514
Here it -- Oh, no.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.251
What?
What?

09:44.284 --> 09:46.419
Uh, I think you may be using

09:46.453 --> 09:49.990
a site where people
share partners.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.291
What do you...

09:51.324 --> 09:53.761
Share partners.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.031
You hooked us up
with swingers?

09:58.065 --> 09:59.532
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.034
Chale, just scroll down.
Let me see that.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.335
No, look at this.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.437
There's couples singing,
couples dancing,

10:04.471 --> 10:07.875
couples wrestling --
Ooh, that's not wrestling.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.810
You hooked us up
with swingers!

10:09.843 --> 10:11.979
I will be in the garage.

10:12.012 --> 10:15.315
And just know, whatever you
decide, no judgment.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.351
Get out, get out.
Get out.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.589
( Door closes )

10:22.622 --> 10:23.991
All right, look, I'm sorry,
all right?

10:24.024 --> 10:25.392
I will go out there
and I will get rid of them.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.394
Let's not be rude,
all right?

10:27.427 --> 10:29.196
Because this is kind of
our mistake.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.964
Let's just finish the wine
and we'll wrap it up

10:30.998 --> 10:32.866
in a classy way.
All right, but --

10:32.900 --> 10:35.402
Hey, what if it gets weird?
What do you mean?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.037
What if they...

10:37.070 --> 10:39.239
wanna get jiggy with us?

10:40.741 --> 10:44.511
They won't,
because it's not 1998.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.847
Besides, they haven't
tried anything all night.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.149
You're right. All right.
Okay.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.751
Wait.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.854
Why haven't
they tried anything?

10:53.887 --> 10:55.856
What? You want them to?
Well, no!

10:55.889 --> 10:58.425
It's always nice
to be asked.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.427
It's still early.
Maybe they're gonna plan

11:00.460 --> 11:02.629
to make their move now
or something.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.633
Hey. What's, uh, going on?

11:06.666 --> 11:08.969
Oh, you know, we have
an early morning. But, um...

11:09.002 --> 11:10.804
-Yeah.
-Thanks -- thanks for dinner.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.673
Wait. Did --
did we do something wrong?

11:13.707 --> 11:17.778
Um, look, to be honest,
we're, uh,

11:17.811 --> 11:19.546
not really feeling you guys.

11:19.579 --> 11:22.582
Especially, uh...

11:22.615 --> 11:24.351
It's not important.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.659
Wow.
Turned down by swingers.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.328
Now we know.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.998
I should've worn
my stretchy jeans.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.805
Well, that's gonna sting
for a while.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.841
Yep. Bye-bye, pizza boat.

11:47.875 --> 11:51.011
That's the takeaway from this?
The pizza boat?

11:51.044 --> 11:53.680
It's the frontrunner
right now, yes.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.182
You're unbelievable.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.750
Look, I don't know what you
want us to do, all right?

11:56.784 --> 11:58.251
I mean, nobody wants to
hang out with us.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.788
Us?

12:00.821 --> 12:01.955
You're saying it was me?

12:01.989 --> 12:03.623
Babe, I don't wanna
hurt your feelings,

12:03.656 --> 12:05.458
but 100% yes.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.995
What?! Okay, well, since we're
taking feelings off the table,

12:08.028 --> 12:09.096
I'm gonna tell you
right now,

12:09.129 --> 12:12.132
I've been carrying
this team for years.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.500
-Carrying us?
-Yeah.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.902
With what? Your stupid jokes?

12:14.935 --> 12:17.304
Those little jokes are
a lighthouse for people

12:17.337 --> 12:20.007
who are lost in the ocean
of your boring-ass stories.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.843
They're out there floating.
Oh, they're out there.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.211
They're just floating around
and like,

12:24.244 --> 12:25.946
"I think I see it
in the harbor.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.448
There it is, the light."

12:28.481 --> 12:30.918
-Are you done?
-Now I am.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.485
I get it.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.321
My stories are interesting,
okay?

12:34.354 --> 12:36.623
I'll have you know that
three separate people

12:36.656 --> 12:38.959
have told me
I should have a vlog.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.327
A vlog? What is that?

12:40.360 --> 12:42.429
A cabin in the woods where
you take people to bore them?

12:44.531 --> 12:48.268
No. It's a video blog, okay?

12:48.301 --> 12:51.071
And maybe if you listened
instead of interrupting me

12:51.104 --> 12:53.874
when I'm trying to --
I'm doing you a favor.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.877
I am like the music
at an awards show.

12:56.910 --> 13:01.348
A gentle reminder to
wrap things up.

13:01.381 --> 13:05.953
Okay. Well, at least I didn't
blow it with the swingers.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.788
Oh, you don't think
that was me?

13:08.822 --> 13:10.390
Really?
No, no, no, no.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.159
I don't wanna do this,
I didn't wanna bring it up,

13:12.192 --> 13:13.593
but at the restaurant, they
couldn't take their eyes
off me.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.995
None of us could.

13:15.028 --> 13:18.431
You had a piece of linguine
on your chin for over an hour.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.967
It wasn't the linguine.
They were looking at me, like,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.268
"Ooh, I love him."
"Look at him."

13:21.301 --> 13:23.036
They were like,
"Ooh. Look at him."

13:23.070 --> 13:24.404
Really?
Even the waiter
was walking by, like,

13:24.437 --> 13:25.906
"Ooh, look at that. Ooh."
He did, like, one of these.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.240
Okay, well, if they were
so into you,

13:27.274 --> 13:28.575
were they texting you?

13:28.608 --> 13:30.443
'Cause they've been blowing up
my phone since they left.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.112
I don't know. Let me check.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.781
Aha! In your face.
They texted you?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.984
No, but Frank
from the deli did.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.120
Ah, what are we doing?

13:40.153 --> 13:41.889
Why are we turning
on each other?

13:41.922 --> 13:44.191
( Sighs ) I don't know.
You're right.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.659
I'm...I'm sorry, all right?

13:46.693 --> 13:50.197
No, honey, I'm sorry, too.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.732
( Sighs )
You know what? It's just...

13:52.765 --> 13:55.102
I always thought that
you and I were enough.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.736
We didn't need another couple,
you know?

13:56.769 --> 13:58.138
Well, we don't.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.540
We just need to get
back to that.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.042
Tomorrow night, let's --

14:02.075 --> 14:03.576
just you and I,
let's go on a date.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.312
Nobody else, it'll be
just the two of us.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.114
I would love that, okay?

14:07.147 --> 14:09.616
-I love you.
-I love you. Sorry.

14:09.649 --> 14:10.817
-Good night.
-Good night.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.185
( Switch clicks )

14:14.454 --> 14:16.656
Wait a second.
I didn't even have linguine.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.827
No. Steve did, but When you
finished your pizza,

14:20.860 --> 14:23.496
you said, "Can I snag some?"

14:23.530 --> 14:25.498
That's right. Good night.

14:28.035 --> 14:31.071
( Crickets chirping )

14:31.104 --> 14:33.606
Ah, see, this is --
now this is all we need.
Mm.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.376
The stars up above,
big bag of cheeseburgers,

14:36.409 --> 14:39.346
and my lady by my side.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.148
I'm not crazy about
the order,

14:41.181 --> 14:44.284
but that's very sweet.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.785
You all right?

14:45.818 --> 14:47.287
Yeah, it's just the, uh,

14:47.320 --> 14:49.389
the windshield wiper keeps
digging into my back.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.858
( Laughs ) There we go.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.326
This is good, you know?

14:53.360 --> 14:56.096
We don't need Goody or Mott
or any -- It's not good.

14:56.129 --> 14:59.299
It's not good.
All right, all right.
Honey, just wait, please.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.134
Please, stop moving around.
You're gonna --

15:01.168 --> 15:03.503
You're gonna
push me off the edge.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.272
Oh, now it's out.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.808
Figure it out. Okay.
Okay.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.578
( Sighs )

15:11.611 --> 15:14.047
You know, when I was
in junior high,

15:14.081 --> 15:15.715
I was a little awkward.
You know that.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.485
I was a foot taller than
everybody, I had braces,

15:18.518 --> 15:21.721
I had a boys haircut,
and I was really skinny, like,

15:21.754 --> 15:25.458
like my whole body was made of
bendy straws skinny, you know?

15:25.492 --> 15:28.728
And these two girls --
I thought
they were my friends,

15:28.761 --> 15:31.098
but they went to this party,
they didn't invite me --

15:31.131 --> 15:34.501
( Imitating horn tooting )

15:34.534 --> 15:35.969
( Imitates drumming )

15:36.003 --> 15:39.139
( Imitating up-tempo music )
Stop it!

15:39.172 --> 15:40.740
This story has a point.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.243
Yes, a very dull point.

15:43.276 --> 15:47.514
Which is...Goody and Mott --
they dumped on us,

15:47.547 --> 15:50.483
but we're kind of letting them
get away with it.

15:50.517 --> 15:53.353
You know what? We should --
we should go to that resort

15:53.386 --> 15:56.023
and have a good time
and make sure they see us.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.757
We can't. We can't go there.
Wha--

15:57.790 --> 15:59.326
It's gonna look sad.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.794
More sad
than we are right now?
( Exhales )

16:01.828 --> 16:02.996
So what are we gonna do?

16:03.030 --> 16:05.298
I wanna make 'em jealous,
but look,

16:05.332 --> 16:07.467
we just don't have another
couple to go with.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.836
Well...
( Sighs )

16:09.869 --> 16:13.106
There is still one couple
we have in the hopper.

16:14.207 --> 16:18.511
( Utensils clacking )

16:18.545 --> 16:21.681
I have to say, I'm surprised
you invited us.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.084
I didn't think we were part
of your inner circle.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.253
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah, we --

16:26.286 --> 16:29.356
we've been honing in on
you guys for quite some time.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.324
Just waiting for the right
moment to get to
know you better

16:31.358 --> 16:32.992
and I think we found
that moment, right, hon?

16:33.026 --> 16:35.595
Oh, yeah. You know,
Kevin and I were just saying
the other day,

16:35.628 --> 16:39.232
we gotta hang out with Rootger
and, uh, and, um...

16:39.266 --> 16:42.935
-Floor.
-Right. Oh, I know. Floor.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.472
Are you having a good time,
Floorsie?

16:45.505 --> 16:48.075
Time of my life.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.512
Oh, there they are.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.847
( Utensils clinking )
( Laughing )

16:54.881 --> 16:56.916
-Whoa!
-Yeah!

16:56.949 --> 16:58.151
Oh!
( Laughter and applause )

16:58.185 --> 17:00.287
That looks like a fun table.
Oh --

17:00.320 --> 17:03.523
( Cheering, laughter )

17:03.556 --> 17:06.126
Shut all the doors.
Did you see that?

17:06.159 --> 17:08.395
A volcano made of onions.

17:08.428 --> 17:11.098
Oh, I love it. This is great.

17:11.131 --> 17:14.801
I can't believe what
my eyes are seeing.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.470
You know what? Here is where
the money's at, okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.306
We will get our own volcano.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.242
Yeah, all right. I bet
you make a pretty mean
onion volcano,

17:22.275 --> 17:23.576
right, uh, Sanjay?

17:23.610 --> 17:26.579
This is my first day.

17:26.613 --> 17:30.450
So how about a, uh, choo-choo
train of bowls, huh?

17:30.483 --> 17:32.819
-Look at this. Look at this.
-All right, okay.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.488
-Look, look, look. Choo choo.
-Oh!

17:35.522 --> 17:37.424
Oh! Look at them,
they're all in a row!
( Laughs )

17:37.457 --> 17:39.659
Yeah, boy, look at them go!
Chugga, chugga, chugga!

17:39.692 --> 17:41.828
Giddy on up!
( Imitating chugging )

17:41.861 --> 17:43.330
( Indistinct conversations )

17:43.363 --> 17:44.764
-Oh...
-Oh!

17:44.797 --> 17:46.566
Oh, man!

17:46.599 --> 17:48.768
-This guy's amazing!
-( Laughs )

17:50.603 --> 17:53.573
Oh, I think he wants you
to look in your pocket, dawg.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.344
Shut up!

17:57.377 --> 18:00.513
Oh! ( Laughing )

18:00.547 --> 18:03.283
Ooh, watch out,
everybody.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.051
It's going to blow.

18:06.553 --> 18:07.854
( Soft poof )

18:10.757 --> 18:14.161
This volcano makes me sad.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.795
Okay, come on, Sanjay,

18:15.828 --> 18:17.497
get -- get some gasoline
or something, all right?
Yeah.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.798
I'm going to get some stuff
from the back.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.567
-Make it happen, man.
-( Laughs )

18:20.600 --> 18:22.669
This is...

18:22.702 --> 18:24.137
Wait. Honey,
what are you doing?

18:24.171 --> 18:26.005
No, I'm just gonna
add a little sizzle
to this night, okay?

18:26.038 --> 18:28.107
-Please be careful.
-Oh, I will, okay?

18:28.141 --> 18:29.776
It's just like ring toss,
only with food

18:29.809 --> 18:32.412
and a very hot surface, okay?

18:32.445 --> 18:34.414
Oh! Ah!

18:34.447 --> 18:36.449
Hey! Hey!

18:36.483 --> 18:38.285
Floorsie,
you want some shrimp?

18:38.318 --> 18:40.052
Hey, Floorsie, shrimp?
Here you go, Floorsie.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.654
-Whoa!
-Whoa. Okay.

18:41.688 --> 18:44.957
( Laughs ) Look at that.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.360
I will still eat this.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.329
Hey, sweetheart,
you're up next.
Okay, okay, okay.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.298
-You ready? Oh, oh, oh.
-Oh!

18:51.331 --> 18:52.599
-Oh! Hey!
-Yeah!

18:52.632 --> 18:54.901
Hey!

18:54.934 --> 18:57.204
Oh! Okay -- Oh --

18:59.906 --> 19:01.541
Is that Kev?

19:01.574 --> 19:03.009
( Utensils clinking )

19:03.042 --> 19:05.245
Hey!

19:05.278 --> 19:08.481
Oh, hey, man.
What the hell are you doing?

19:08.515 --> 19:10.483
Taking my wife
and my real friends out

19:10.517 --> 19:12.319
for a nice night out.
Donna: Yeah.

19:12.352 --> 19:15.322
Rootger, look alive, buddy.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.156
( Chomps )
( Laughing )

19:17.190 --> 19:18.391
( Utensils clinking )

19:18.425 --> 19:20.327
Wait. "Real friends"?

19:20.360 --> 19:21.794
Hold up, are you mad at us?

19:21.828 --> 19:24.697
Well, truth is,
you should have invited us.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.400
We would've invited you guys,
but you said you were busy.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.501
( Scoffs ) Oh, oh!

19:28.535 --> 19:30.370
Your lies don't work
at this table.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.071
No, we were
in your living room,

19:32.104 --> 19:34.040
and you said you had to
work every Saturday.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.008
What are you even
talking about?
I never said that.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.211
Yeah, until the playground
was finished.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.812
Remember? For the kids?

19:39.846 --> 19:42.449
In fact, weren't you supposed
to be there today?

19:52.959 --> 19:55.595
Oh, that's right.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.831
( Gasps )

19:58.865 --> 20:00.267
Ow.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.006
( Thud, sizzling )

20:07.039 --> 20:09.242
Aah!
( Thud )

20:12.779 --> 20:14.213
You know, Kev,
tomorrow morning,

20:14.247 --> 20:15.815
Goody and I are gonna
head over there and help you

20:15.848 --> 20:16.949
finish that playground.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.286
Thanks, guys.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.621
( Glasses clinking )
Cheers.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.989
There you go.
All right. All right.

20:23.022 --> 20:25.958
But you know what?
I still can't believe
you guys thought

20:25.992 --> 20:27.494
we would just ditch you
like that.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.362
Yeah, we would never
do that to y'all.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.730
( Sighs )
I know. I'm sorry.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.432
We overreacted.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.301
Come on, we love you guys.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.002
Yeah, you should know that.

20:36.035 --> 20:38.170
Oh, thank you, but I mean,
in our defense,

20:38.204 --> 20:39.772
we were really hurt.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.808
It doesn't feel good
to be left out.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.776
No, it doesn't.

20:46.513 --> 20:50.016
Is there something
wrong with us?

20:50.049 --> 20:51.684
Us?

20:54.354 --> 20:57.690
* Don't want
no sweet perfume *

20:57.724 --> 21:01.294
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

21:01.328 --> 21:03.496
* Do, do, do, do, do

21:03.530 --> 21:05.031
* Do, do, do, do

21:05.064 --> 21:08.635
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

21:08.668 --> 21:11.704
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

21:11.738 --> 21:14.307
* I just don't want no...
