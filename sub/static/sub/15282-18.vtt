00:07.830 --> 00:09.286
SILVER SPRING, MARYLAND

00:09.290 --> 00:12.828
-I'm sorry. I can't find my ticket.
-Phone number.

00:14.380 --> 00:16.996
-Just...
-I've got a line out the door.

00:20.420 --> 00:23.821
301-555-0194.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.786
Okay, that's $22.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.325
Excuse me.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.167
Keri Derzmond?

00:35.790 --> 00:38.281
-Yes.
-Insurance card.

00:41.460 --> 00:44.702
-Can't find you in the system.
-No, I'm in there.

00:44.710 --> 00:49.784
Wait a sec. D-E-Râ€”Z-M-O-N-D.
Are you still on Foxborough Drive?

00:49.790 --> 00:52.497
-Everything's still the same.
-Sign here.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.036
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

01:19.750 --> 01:22.457
He's back. He found me again.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.610
Fear is the weapon.

01:24.620 --> 01:27.919
If his target is afraid and affected,
then he's won.

01:28.290 --> 01:30.611
Again, myself and SSA Hotchner

01:30.620 --> 01:31.780
TERRORISM SEMINAR, BOSTON

01:31.790 --> 01:33.496
are available to any of you
should you need us.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.913
The direct line to our liaison is
In the packet you received.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.535
And trust your instincts
and experience.

01:38.540 --> 01:41.373
They're the best tools you have.
Thank you.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.741
Eve Alexander,
Suffolk County District Attorney.

01:46.750 --> 01:49.116
SSA Hotchner. This is SSA Rossi.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.327
I know. Big fan of your books.

01:51.790 --> 01:55.032
And I followed your work
as a federal prosecutor.

01:55.040 --> 01:58.248
So you didn't come here
for the terrorism seminar.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.876
No.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.825
Two days ago,
a woman named Audrey Henson

02:01.830 --> 02:05.243
did this to her husband of 20 years
while he was sleeping.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.787
She confessed while sitting
next to the body at the crime scene

02:07.790 --> 02:10.076
and repeated her confession to me
at the lockup.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.913
Care to guess what her lavwer's
already working on as her defense?

02:12.920 --> 02:14.285
Battered woman syndrome.

02:14.290 --> 02:16.372
After years
of systematic abuse,

02:16.380 --> 02:20.282
his client suddenly had no option
left to her but a 12-gauge.

02:20.290 --> 02:22.281
And yet there's never been
a domestic violence report

02:22.290 --> 02:23.700
filed from that home,

02:23.710 --> 02:26.326
not a single medical record
documenting injury,

02:26.330 --> 02:28.321
and not one witness who can say
they ever saw

02:28.330 --> 02:30.321
or even suspected abuse.

02:30.670 --> 02:33.412
-So what do you need from us?
-I think I can win this case anyway,

02:33.420 --> 02:36.412
but I'd like you to help me prove
that she's lying.

02:36.420 --> 02:38.820
Proving a negative,
that something didn't happen,

02:38.830 --> 02:40.286
is always a long shot.

02:40.290 --> 02:43.578
Yes, but you can show she doesn't fit
the profile of a battered woman.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.322
What if she isn't? Lying.

02:46.330 --> 02:48.207
That's not going to be a problem.

02:48.210 --> 02:51.418
Her husband can't defend himself
from what she's saying about him

02:51.420 --> 02:53.786
any more than he could
against a shotgun.

02:53.790 --> 02:55.200
Doesn't that bother anyone?

02:55.210 --> 02:57.166
Will she talk to us

02:57.170 --> 02:59.035
Her attorney's already agreed
to let her.

02:59.040 --> 03:02.919
Practically insists on it.
Claims she's got nothing to hide.

03:02.920 --> 03:06.879
Well, I can't promise that
what we'll find is gonna help your case.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.871
Let me worry about that.

03:11.790 --> 03:14.327
F.B.I. Behavioral Analysis Unit
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

03:14.330 --> 03:16.036
-You done?
-Almost.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.450
It's pretty powerful, right?

03:18.460 --> 03:21.577
Phew! I can see
why you'd meet With her.

03:22.540 --> 03:25.111
30's here.
-Okay. Just give me one minute.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.202
Hi, I'm Keri Derzmond.

03:28.170 --> 03:31.412
-Hi, Agent Jareau. This is...
-Emily Prentiss.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.739
I'm sorry to rush in,

03:32.750 --> 03:36.072
but when I got the message
you'd see me this morning,

03:36.830 --> 03:40.038
I could barely sleep last night.
But that's nothing new.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.531
I haven't been able to sleep
for about two years.

03:42.540 --> 03:45.282
We read the letter you wrote
to the Silver Spring police.

03:45.290 --> 03:47.201
Begging and pleading wasn't
getting their attention.

03:47.210 --> 03:49.371
They needed to know
I wasn't going away.

03:49.380 --> 03:53.202
So you've been getting these notes
for the past two years?

03:53.210 --> 03:56.168
I used to be in Atlanta.
I moved here six months ago.

03:56.170 --> 03:58.991
And then out of nowhere, another note.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.413
I can't live like this anymore.
I want my life back.

04:02.420 --> 04:04.615
What did the police tell you?

04:04.620 --> 04:08.033
The detective I met with
was very sympathetic,

04:08.040 --> 04:10.827
but his hands are tied
unless something happens to me.

04:10.830 --> 04:14.379
Then it will be too late.
Will you help me?

04:18.040 --> 04:20.247
I'm presenting the case to our team
this morning.

04:20.250 --> 04:22.616
I'll let you know what we decide.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.206
Lou Evans,

04:27.120 --> 04:31.329
Ed Derzmond and Ryan Scott.

04:32.670 --> 04:34.035
Excuse me?

04:34.040 --> 04:35.826
Those are the people
who you'll be calling

04:35.830 --> 04:37.707
when you find me dead.

05:45.580 --> 05:46.820
Where's Mom and Dad?

05:46.830 --> 05:48.661
Hotch and Rossi are still
at the seminar in Boston.

05:48.670 --> 05:49.876
We shouldn't wait on this.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.201
JJ pulled me in early. I agree.

05:52.670 --> 05:54.114
This is Keri Derzmond.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.669
Two years ago in Atlanta
she started receiving anonymous notes

05:57.670 --> 06:00.616
that meticulously described
her whereabouts throughout the day.

06:00.620 --> 06:03.327
Local authorities never found out
who was responsrble.

06:03.330 --> 06:07.289
Recently, she moved to Maryland,
brought the stalker with her.

06:07.290 --> 06:08.746
They think it's the same person?

06:08.750 --> 06:11.241
He includes photographs of himself.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.570
None of his face. That's very telling.

06:16.580 --> 06:20.323
He's either trying to protect his identity
or he has self-image issues.

06:20.330 --> 06:23.822
He's controlling the parts of his body
that he shows to her.

06:23.830 --> 06:26.913
He writes to Keri in these letters
about their future together,

06:26.920 --> 06:28.740
having kids, growing old.

06:28.750 --> 06:32.163
He believes Keri is in love with him
and Just doesn't know It yet.

06:32.170 --> 06:36.459
Okay, so the guy's clearly delusional,
but what makes this a BAU case?

06:36.460 --> 06:40.328
He is so obsessed that he tracked her
over 600 miles away.

06:40.330 --> 06:41.536
That is unusual.

06:41.540 --> 06:43.872
Typically a stalker will
change his focus to another woman

06:43.880 --> 06:46.110
if the object of his affection
moves away.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.611
I mean, I get that. I mean,
he's way past a first-level escalation.

06:48.620 --> 06:50.781
But still.

06:50.790 --> 06:53.031
When Keri received the first letter
in Maryland,

06:53.040 --> 06:54.871
she went to the locals for protection.

06:54.880 --> 06:59.283
They told her they couldn't help her.
This woman is in serious danger.

06:59.290 --> 07:01.326
This case is in my hands now

07:01.330 --> 07:04.242
and if we do nothing
and something happens to her,

07:05.330 --> 07:07.912
I'll be the one notifying her family.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.075
Okay.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.376

Author
Christian Nestell Bovee once wrote,

07:23.420 --> 07:26.708
"No man is happy without a delusion
of some kind.

07:26.710 --> 07:30.328
"Delusions are as necessary
to our happiness as realities."

07:31.120 --> 07:32.280
Nothing at all?

07:32.290 --> 07:33.370
No, sir.

07:33.380 --> 07:34.529
BOSTON, P.D.

07:34.540 --> 07:36.371
There's no driver's license,
no passport,

07:36.380 --> 07:39.076
no bank accounts,
not even jointly held.

07:39.620 --> 07:43.329
Her name's not on their plastic,
their checks,

07:43.330 --> 07:47.289
their mortgage, their car titles.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.417
Aside from a birth certificate
and a marriage license,

07:50.420 --> 07:53.742
there's no actual record_
that Audrey Henson even exrsts.

07:53.750 --> 07:55.377
How many years in the current home?

07:55.380 --> 07:57.996
It looks like they've lived in that house
their whole married life.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.116
And we're certain
there are no medical records

08:00.120 --> 08:01.951
that point to a history of abuse?

08:01.960 --> 08:03.279
Actually, sir,

08:03.750 --> 08:04.990
there's no medical record at all

08:05.000 --> 08:07.571
beyond the birth
of their second child, Nathan.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.036
What about life insurance

08:10.040 --> 08:13.373
Any financial motive
for Audrey to kill her husband?

08:13.380 --> 08:15.325
No. I mean, there's insurance,

08:15.330 --> 08:18.663
but Mrs. Henson isn't the beneficiary
of any of the policies.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.451
Sarah, their 19-year-old daughter, is.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.876
Thanks.

08:31.580 --> 08:34.413
_ So we_can use this area
until something bigger comes along.

08:34.420 --> 08:35.614
Police Department
SILVER SPRING, MD

08:35.620 --> 08:37.030
I set it up
just like Agent Jareau requested.

08:37.040 --> 08:38.200
Is she coming, by the way?

08:38.210 --> 08:40.997
She and another agent
are at Keri's office.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.781
Aren't you guys a little overqualified
for this case?

08:43.790 --> 08:45.951
I mean, this guy's no serial killer.

08:45.960 --> 08:49.498
We construct behavioral profiles
for a variety of investigative scenarios.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.070
That includes stalking.

08:51.080 --> 08:54.459
We've seen this kind of thing before
and it can get ugly real fast.

08:54.460 --> 08:57.702
Hey, I wanted to help this girl
the day she came in. Ijust...

08:57.710 --> 08:59.029
I didn't have the manpower.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.201
Listen, we understand
what it's like to be short-handed.

09:01.210 --> 09:02.325
We're just here to help.

09:02.330 --> 09:04.321
Look, don't get me wrong.
I got a sister Keri's age

09:04.330 --> 09:08.289
and if some guy was doing this to her
and I got my hands on him,

09:08.620 --> 09:12.169
-I'd probably get thrown off the force.
-You and me both.

09:14.460 --> 09:17.497
-What was that?
-BureaucratIc red tape.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.707
Every case we take
I have to explain why

09:20.710 --> 09:23.531
in terms of cost and size
relative to the BAU.

09:23.540 --> 09:25.326
They don't always think it's worth it.

09:25.330 --> 09:28.208
You do have four agents
doing the work that locals should.

09:28.210 --> 09:29.666
Just because there isn't a dead body

09:29.670 --> 09:31.376
doesn't mean
we shouldn't take the case.

09:31.380 --> 09:35.248
Hey, the fact that
law enforcement, including the FBI,

09:35.250 --> 09:38.913
can't help someone
until they've been injured is appalling.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.912
All I'm saying is
it is a drain on the system.

09:42.170 --> 09:43.319
Emily,

09:44.210 --> 09:45.416
last year in Denver,

09:45.420 --> 09:47.376
a woman was being harassed
by her ex-boyfriend.

09:47.380 --> 09:50.281
Cops knew who he was,
but they couldn't arrest him.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.246
We didn't take that case.

09:52.250 --> 09:54.320
She was finally granted
a restraining order

09:54.330 --> 09:57.322
three days after he threw acid
in her face.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.572
Right now, I don't care
about limited resources.

10:00.580 --> 10:03.162
I cannot make that same mistake again.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.456
Okay, when Keri lived in Atlanta,

10:08.460 --> 10:11.418
the initial communication
happened at her job.

10:11.880 --> 10:15.247
But then they got more personal
and started going to her home.

10:15.250 --> 10:18.617
The first card is likely
an anniversary date of sorts.

10:18.620 --> 10:21.999
The first time he saw her
or the first face-to-face meeting.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.619
He actually wrote the date on the card.
March 215t, 2006.

10:26.620 --> 10:28.372
That was a Tuesday.

10:29.380 --> 10:32.110
Okay, so we should look
at other Tuesdays,

10:32.120 --> 10:35.203
previous months on the 215t,
and March of 2005.

10:36.790 --> 10:40.112
If we can figure out
what this date means to the stalker,

10:40.120 --> 10:42.111
it could trace his connection
back to Keri.

10:42.670 --> 10:44.206
Why the move to Maryland?

10:44.210 --> 10:47.498
Ryan lives here
and my firm just opened an office.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.286
The move wasn't
because of the stalker,

10:49.290 --> 10:53.169
although the police back in Atlanta
thought it was a good idea.

10:53.170 --> 10:55.286
I'm always cautious,

10:55.290 --> 10:57.281
but for the first time I felt that

10:57.290 --> 11:00.578
if I looked over my shoulder,
no one would be there.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.571
We need you to make a list of names
of everyone you know,

11:03.580 --> 11:05.992
even acquaintances.
Both here and in Georgia.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.820
-Okay.
-Don't forget ex-boyfriends

11:07.830 --> 11:09.661
or any indiscretions.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.661
Nothing is insignificant.

11:12.880 --> 11:16.919
If I knew what I was doing
to make this guy so obsessed, I'd stop.

11:17.290 --> 11:21.249
When your paths crossed,
something clicked with him.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.495
If you were smiling,

11:23.500 --> 11:26.617
he probably thought
you were smiling at him.

11:26.620 --> 11:29.327
We have no way of knowing
what his fantasy is.

11:29.330 --> 11:31.378
What we do know_is
you're the star of It.

11:32.830 --> 11:35.458
It's Ryan. He says it's an emergency.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.611
You okay? Yeah, they're here now.

11:41.330 --> 11:44.037
Ryan's at home. There's another card
and a box at the door.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.917
Tell him not to touch it.
We're on our way.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.879
Okay, so every Tuesday,
Keri's firm has a staff meeting,

11:49.880 --> 11:51.700
and it's catered
by a lot of different restaurants.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.666
I'll add it to the list.

11:55.670 --> 11:56.876
What do you see?

11:56.880 --> 11:59.246
Look at the new photograph
Keri received in Maryland.

11:59.250 --> 12:03.744
Now look at the old ones from Atlanta.
The muscle tone's changed.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.991
The bicep is far more defined.

12:07.250 --> 12:09.457
Also, skin color. He's tan.

12:09.460 --> 12:12.111
Why do we care if he's lifting weights
and out in the sun?

12:12.120 --> 12:14.532
We're looking at this
from a behavioral standpoint.

12:14.540 --> 12:16.076
He's making improvements
to his appearance

12:16.080 --> 12:18.378
and it's likely to impress Keri.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.706
What does her fianc look like?

12:22.710 --> 12:26.999
_ Here it_ is. _
I appreCIate you drIVIng Keri home.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.914
Ever since this guy showed up again,
I've been taking her everywhere.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.990
Would he send something
that could hurt me?

12:34.000 --> 12:37.288
Probably not, but we don't want
to take any chances.

12:37.540 --> 12:40.532
You really think this guy would do
something like that after all this time?

12:40.540 --> 12:44.032
At this point, you haven't
done anything to provoke him.

12:47.460 --> 12:49.701
It's just a pair of earrings.

12:49.710 --> 12:51.280
They look like antiques.

12:51.290 --> 12:54.202
It says they were his grandmother's.
Family heirloom.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.411
He wants to make you
a part of his family.

12:57.420 --> 13:00.071
Well, we have
the back of his head now.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.163
He hopes that
you give him a gift soon, too.

13:03.170 --> 13:04.706
What does that mean?

13:04.710 --> 13:07.577
We should probably get this back
to the station and start a trace.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.207
You can find him that way?

13:09.210 --> 13:12.373
First-class mail's harder to track,
but we'll see.

13:12.790 --> 13:15.167
_ _ Officers will be _ _
drivmg by your house periodically,

13:15.170 --> 13:16.410
looking for anything suspicious.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.376
And you have my number
if anything happens.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.666
We'll call and let you know
if we find anything.

13:20.670 --> 13:21.989
Thank you.

13:26.330 --> 13:29.709
His confidence is building
and now he wants something.

13:29.710 --> 13:31.917
-What do you think that is?
-I don't know.

13:31.920 --> 13:35.458
I'm scared about what happens
when she doesn't give it to him.

13:37.670 --> 13:40.707
Is that what my mother said

13:40.710 --> 13:42.701
We haven't spoken to your mother yet,

13:42.710 --> 13:45.998
_ _ but we understand
it's being suggested by her attorney.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.456
Unbelievable.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.788
-She's actually blaming him

13:51.790 --> 13:54.281
If anyone was abused, it was my father,

13:54.290 --> 13:56.497
what he had to put up with
being married to her.

13:56.500 --> 14:00.209
She was a lousy cook.
She couldn't do the laundry right.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.326
The house was always filthy.
Hell, she couldn't even grocery shop

14:03.330 --> 14:06.493
-without some kind of supervision.
-Supervision?

14:07.040 --> 14:08.780
She'd get all the wrong things.

14:08.790 --> 14:11.281
Wrong brands,
too much or too little of something.

14:11.290 --> 14:14.612
And my father was
always patient with her. Always.

14:14.620 --> 14:17.168
She's just... She isn't...

14:18.170 --> 14:19.956
She's not bright.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.748
-You mean she's mentally challenged?
-No, I mean she's stupid.

14:24.420 --> 14:26.706
This is your mother
we're talking about here.

14:26.710 --> 14:28.246
No, we're talking about a woman

14:28.250 --> 14:31.287
who killed the only real parent
we've ever had.

14:31.290 --> 14:35.909
Our father was kind and gentle
and loving.

14:37.420 --> 14:39.661
He always had time for us. Always.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.161
He was at every game,
every school event,

14:42.170 --> 14:44.115
-everything important.
-And what about your mother?

14:44.120 --> 14:47.169
She never went to anything.
Not once in my whole life.

14:47.170 --> 14:48.819
I guess she just couldn't be bothered.

14:48.830 --> 14:51.037
So if your father didn't
abuse your mother,

14:51.040 --> 14:52.871
why did she kill him?

14:53.710 --> 14:56.452
Probably just to take him away from us.

14:56.460 --> 14:59.532
She was jealous that he loved us
more than her.

14:59.830 --> 15:01.821
Why would she think that?

15:05.830 --> 15:08.162
Because he said so all the time.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.160
Come on.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.419
Let me guess.
You don't want me to read?

15:20.330 --> 15:23.493
We're going to fix dinner,
and we're going to do it together.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.821
Are we going to pretend
there's not some weird guy

15:25.830 --> 15:27.707
leaving me presents, too?

15:27.710 --> 15:30.873
-What weird guy?
-I'll take that as a yes.

15:34.290 --> 15:36.667
-Will you go check on him?
-Okay.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.917
-The gate's open.
-What?

15:45.580 --> 15:46.786
Brodie?

15:49.960 --> 15:52.747
Keri Derzmond? Silver Spring PD.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.206
I just saw your dog take off
down the street.

15:54.210 --> 15:56.417
The only way to open the gate
is from the inside.

15:56.420 --> 15:57.569
Which means
someone scaled the fence

15:57.580 --> 15:58.706
so they wouldn't be seen.

15:58.710 --> 16:00.371
All right, I want you both to go
back inside the house

16:00.380 --> 16:02.109
and lock the door behind you.

16:02.120 --> 16:05.749
-I should go look for Brodie.
-Keri, we need to go inside.

16:15.420 --> 16:16.660
Oh, my...

16:26.210 --> 16:29.327
-Where is he?
-This was on your neighbors lawn.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.991
-Oh, God...
-It's okay, it's okay.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.996
I miss her, too, Brodie.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.707
I miss her, too.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.571
This guy's definitely
trying to mirror Ryan.

16:57.580 --> 16:58.956
He's even got the same haircut.

16:58.960 --> 17:02.202
He's trying to replicate
what Keri's attracted to.

17:03.210 --> 17:04.609
If he starts feeling good about himself,

17:04.620 --> 17:07.612
he's going to find the courage
he needs to actually meet her.

17:07.620 --> 17:10.532
Are we charging him with dognapping
now, too?

17:11.790 --> 17:14.281
Taking a dog might not
seem like much to you,

17:14.290 --> 17:17.168
but it tells us that he's desperately
trying to feel close to her.

17:17.170 --> 17:20.162
He was bold enough
to break in her baclqard.

17:21.670 --> 17:23.740
and we got ourselves
a serious escalation here.

17:23.750 --> 17:25.320
I thought he was just messing with her.

17:25.330 --> 17:26.877
We had Keri put flyers up.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.701
We may get him to call
to return the dog.

17:29.710 --> 17:32.326
-Would he do that?
-He wants to prove how much he cares.

17:32.330 --> 17:36.073
Or he won't call if he's jealous of
how much attention the dog is getting.

17:36.080 --> 17:40.039
If he really believes that he's ready
to eliminate all of his competition,

17:40.040 --> 17:41.746
Ryan could be next.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.782
You think he's got the guts
for a confrontation?

17:49.790 --> 17:51.451
Well, he moved here, took Brodie.

17:51.460 --> 17:53.530
He's not going to let anything
get in his way.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.167
He cares about Keri.

17:55.170 --> 17:56.876
Maybe he won't hurt her. He hasn't yet.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.279
He doesn't want to.

17:58.290 --> 18:00.451
But if he feels like
he's going to lose her, then he will.

18:00.460 --> 18:03.702
-Lose her?
-He's been rejected his entire life.

18:03.710 --> 18:06.531
To escape,
he built a vivid fantasy world

18:06.540 --> 18:08.610
in which someone accepted him.

18:08.620 --> 18:09.666
Me.

18:10.420 --> 18:13.321
Worst-case scenario,
he gets you alone.

18:13.330 --> 18:15.116
In which case,
it would be important for you

18:15.120 --> 18:17.668
to play along with his delusions.

18:17.670 --> 18:22.790
-You mean like tell him I love him?
-Within reason, do what he wants.

18:22.790 --> 18:24.951
By gaining his trust,
he'll let his guard down,

18:24.960 --> 18:26.916
and that's when
you can make your move.

18:26.920 --> 18:29.241
You think it could come to that?

18:29.500 --> 18:31.661
Well, not if we can help it.

18:32.170 --> 18:33.660
We're going to have to
comb through your life

18:33.670 --> 18:35.956
ever since he's been a part of it.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.666
Haven't we already done that?

18:37.670 --> 18:41.492
We're talking about each and every
moment for the last two years.

18:41.500 --> 18:44.321
The answer could be
in the smallest detail.

18:44.880 --> 18:45.915
Okay.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.495
Perfect family.

18:51.500 --> 18:54.321
-Two mattresses.
-It's less intimate.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.536
She passed the murder weapon
every day.

18:59.460 --> 19:02.247
And the kids said
she couldn't keep house.

19:04.080 --> 19:06.492
I can't see anything out of place.

19:06.500 --> 19:10.209
Look, even the hangers
are uniformly spaced.

19:10.210 --> 19:14.203
And the shoes. I'll bet if we measured,
they'd be almost perfect.

19:15.210 --> 19:16.700
The kids obviously adopted

19:16.710 --> 19:19.702
their father's skewed perspective
of their mother.

19:19.710 --> 19:22.110
The family that abuses together...

19:23.040 --> 19:25.531
You know, I thought it was just
the angle of the crime scene photos.

19:25.540 --> 19:28.031
There's obviously something missing.

19:32.750 --> 19:35.822
-The rest of the blood.
-Somebody cleaned up.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.031
This man's an incompetent suitor

19:41.040 --> 19:43.372
seeking intimacy with a woman
unavailable to him.

19:43.380 --> 19:47.453
He thinks he's courting his soul mate
who in reality is a total stranger to him.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.701
He's making some
physical improvements,

19:49.710 --> 19:53.032
but even if he is able to get enough
confidence together to speak to Keri,

19:53.040 --> 19:55.417
she'd find it more like
talking to a 12-year-old boy.

19:55.420 --> 19:56.876
A very dangerous one.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.074
His obsession has heightened,

19:58.080 --> 20:00.071
as indicated
by his following her to Maryland

20:00.080 --> 20:02.287
and the amount of detail
in those letters.

20:02.290 --> 20:03.666
He writes instead of calls,

20:03.670 --> 20:06.036
which could mean that
he's afraid of how he'll sound.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.918
He might be less educated
or have some sort of physical issue,

20:08.920 --> 20:10.069
like a speech impediment.

20:10.080 --> 20:13.072
He wouldn't have written
March 215t, 2006, in that first letter

20:13.080 --> 20:14.957
if that date didn't actually
mean something to him.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.246
It could be the first time
he saw her at the bank or the movies.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.036
I mean, the possibilities are endless.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.826
Their paths crossed
somewhere in Atlanta.

20:20.830 --> 20:21.990
He followed her.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.536
So we need to_ focus
on what she's d0ing here,

20:23.540 --> 20:25.667
and how she's living. He's watching.

20:25.670 --> 20:29.492
His move here means that
he's committed and unless he's caught,

20:29.500 --> 20:31.377
he'll never break that commitment.

20:31.380 --> 20:33.826
Yet if he perceives that she has...

20:34.710 --> 20:38.532
We all know domestic disputes
can be some of the most violent.

20:40.710 --> 20:43.110
And there's
nothing else pending?

20:44.830 --> 20:46.491
No, no, it's okay.

20:47.290 --> 20:50.327
We'll be back tomorrow. I'm going to
need the rest of you back then as well.

20:50.330 --> 20:51.957
Okay, thanks.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.575
They're working on
a single stalker case?

20:53.580 --> 20:54.740
Mmm-hmm.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.160
-All of them?
-Mmm-hmm.

20:56.830 --> 20:59.458
JJ seems pretty passionate about it.

20:59.460 --> 21:04.454
You know, sometimes you can see it,
but they all look pretty happy.

21:04.460 --> 21:08.169
Happiness is easy to fake
when you only have a split second.

21:08.170 --> 21:10.115
You should see
how many happy-looking photos

21:10.120 --> 21:12.247
I have of me with my exes.

21:14.830 --> 21:17.913
Were you ever happy
in any of your marriages?

21:17.920 --> 21:20.241
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.820
IfI was, I can't remember.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.576
I'm not sure if me

21:27.580 --> 21:30.538
and the idea of being married
is a good mix.

21:30.920 --> 21:34.037
-You kept trying.
-Well, I didn't have any kids.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.609
What do you mean?

21:39.210 --> 21:43.419
Well, I mean, I might have tried harder
if there were children involved.

21:43.420 --> 21:46.241
-I tried.
-Hotch, I...

21:48.620 --> 21:54.411
I gave absolutely everything to Haley
and Jack and my job.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.206
So, something had to give.

22:02.920 --> 22:06.162
Yeah. You're right.

22:08.880 --> 22:11.997
But it doesn't mean _that
I am any less committed

22:13.710 --> 22:17.032
or try any less hard for my son.

22:18.830 --> 22:20.786
Hey, Hotch, what the hell do I know?

22:20.790 --> 22:24.419
The only people I've ever made happy
were divorce lawyers.

22:31.540 --> 22:33.451
Well, we've got four failed marriages
between us.

22:33.460 --> 22:35.576
We're experts at something.

22:38.580 --> 22:40.662
Where does it all go wrong?

22:41.620 --> 22:46.990
Everybody has their breaking point.
Your wife reached hers.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.912
Jayj, I'm used to doing this
to America's most creepy,

22:57.920 --> 22:59.114
but digging through Keri's life like this

22:59.120 --> 23:00.280
makes me feel all gross and...

23:01.460 --> 23:03.576
We have to in order to help.

23:03.580 --> 23:05.787
Yeah, I know, but it's her business

23:05.790 --> 23:09.078
why she takes a large cash withdrawal
out in Vegas.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.411
Bachelorette party.

23:10.420 --> 23:13.662
Or who she sends flowers
to every month in Wisconsm.

23:13.670 --> 23:14.785
Her grandmother.

23:14.790 --> 23:17.418
And, you know, she has, like,
awesome-town health insurance.

23:17.420 --> 23:18.535
Yep.

23:18.540 --> 23:22.419
And her private doctor
was voted Atlanta's best.

23:22.420 --> 23:24.957
So why did she go to
the Atlanta Women's Health Clinic

23:24.960 --> 23:27.531
not once, not twice, but three times?

23:28.290 --> 23:29.450
Thanks.

23:29.460 --> 23:31.451
We're looking
for a connection to March 215t.

23:31.460 --> 23:34.281
Is that anyone's birthday
or anniversary?

23:34.290 --> 23:37.032
No, the 21st doesn't mean
anything to me.

23:39.460 --> 23:40.825
What's up?

23:44.620 --> 23:47.168
Why'd you go to a clinic last year?

23:51.080 --> 23:53.321
We need full disclosure, Keri.

23:55.460 --> 23:57.109
Ryan doesn't know.

23:59.330 --> 24:04.745
Back when we were figuring out
what this is...

24:06.830 --> 24:10.914
IfI was moving, I was pregnant.

24:11.960 --> 24:15.999
And I couldn't have a baby. Not then.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.615
That was your decision.

24:17.620 --> 24:19.247
You don't have to explain that
to anyone.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.376
I know.

24:20.380 --> 24:23.110
It's just Ryan's career was taking off.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.496
-I didn't want to trap him.
-Keri.

24:24.500 --> 24:27.537
-I didn't want us to have any regrets.
-Keri...

24:30.790 --> 24:31.916
Ryan.

24:37.920 --> 24:40.241
Were you ever going to tell me?

24:43.000 --> 24:46.117
I do.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.878
You didn't think I'd drop everything
to raise a baby?

24:51.880 --> 24:54.451
I knew that's exactly what you'd do.

24:58.750 --> 25:01.913
-I got to go.
-Wait, Ryan, I'm sorry.

25:06.880 --> 25:07.995
Keri.

25:18.580 --> 25:19.740
Damn it!

25:44.880 --> 25:48.611
Thanks. That was Detective Berry.
He just took Ryan's police report.

25:48.620 --> 25:51.703
He's got about $500
worth of damage to his car.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.610
Hey, why are you taking this so hard?

25:56.620 --> 25:58.997
Keri's life has been turned upside-down
for the past two years

25:59.000 --> 26:01.207
and then we just come on in
and tear it up some more.

26:01.210 --> 26:04.247
But to catch her stalker,
we have to ask those questions.

26:04.250 --> 26:08.163
-She knew it would be uncomfortable.
-That's an understatement.

26:08.170 --> 26:10.377
JJ, you fought for this case.

26:10.710 --> 26:13.110
You wanted to help Keri. That's what
we're sitting here trying to do.

26:13.120 --> 26:16.032
Then why do I feel like
we violated her, too?

26:41.080 --> 26:43.378
Excuse me. Excuse me.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.537
You do understand why you're here?

26:58.540 --> 27:00.326
I killed my husband.

27:02.750 --> 27:06.072
And you're aware that
you don't have to talk to us?

27:07.250 --> 27:09.912
What else is there to say? I shot him.

27:11.500 --> 27:12.569
Why?

27:14.040 --> 27:16.611
-It's what I had to do.
-Had to?

27:20.250 --> 27:22.662
It sounds terrible.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.782
-Did Philip ever hit you

27:29.790 --> 27:32.452
-Was he abusive?
-No. Never.

27:33.080 --> 27:35.617
Not even when I probably deserved...

27:37.460 --> 27:39.917
No, he was very patient with me.

27:39.920 --> 27:44.038
-Why did he need to be patient Look at me.

27:44.710 --> 27:48.578
After Nathan was born,
I completely let myself go. I'm fat!

27:48.580 --> 27:51.663
I'm a terrible housekeeper,
I'm a terrible cook!

27:53.620 --> 27:58.159
Yeah, believe me, I needed a husband
with a lot of patience.

28:01.330 --> 28:05.369
Audrey, Nathan tells us that you never
attended any of his sports

28:05.380 --> 28:07.371
or school functions.

28:07.380 --> 28:10.326
That you were never there,
not even once.

28:10.750 --> 28:13.662
-He's probably right.
-Why didn't you?

28:14.790 --> 28:17.202
Well, I was doing
such a terrible job at home,

28:17.210 --> 28:20.668
I didn't want to embarrass my kids
out in public, too.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.491
I knew I'd seen him before.

28:28.500 --> 28:33.073
At my dry cleaner's, at a restaurant.
I didn't know where else to go.

28:33.080 --> 28:35.241
You did the right thing coming here.

28:35.250 --> 28:38.788
Keri, you're going to get through this.
You're strong.

28:38.790 --> 28:41.702
You've been smart. You've_taken
every necessary precaution.

28:41.710 --> 28:45.032
You're not helpless, Keri.
You're prepared and you're protected.

28:47.170 --> 28:49.070
I needed to hear that.

28:49.710 --> 28:51.701
Sounds like he's going
to try to talk to her.

28:51.710 --> 28:54.668
-It could be a risky situation for him.
-Why him?

28:54.670 --> 28:56.661
He's setting himself up for rejection,

28:56.670 --> 28:58.376
and if he feels anger or shame,

28:58.380 --> 29:01.281
there's a possibility
he could turn violent.

29:02.380 --> 29:05.201
All right,
I'm going to get this picture out.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.529
Just...

29:13.380 --> 29:16.747
-JJ okay?
-Yeah, she will be. Once we get a lead.

29:21.420 --> 29:22.569
That was Ryan.

29:22.580 --> 29:25.708
He's taking off for a couple of days
to clear his head.

29:25.710 --> 29:29.578
But he wants to talk first.
I'm gomg to meet him at the house.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.821
All right, tell me what you've got.

29:35.830 --> 29:38.492
-No one ever hit this woman.
-I knew it.

29:38.500 --> 29:41.071
And yet she's been profoundly abused.

29:41.750 --> 29:44.116
-What?
-Her abuse was psychological.

29:44.120 --> 29:46.281
He had complete control over her.

29:46.290 --> 29:49.111
He cut off all her contact
with the outside world.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.701
You've heard of
Stockholm syndrome, right?

29:50.710 --> 29:51.916
You're kidding me.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.411
Prisoners of war, Patty Hearst,
Elizabeth Smart.

29:54.420 --> 29:57.878
They all say the same thing,
they had no place else to go.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.030
Why is it that men so easily believe

30:00.040 --> 30:02.611
that the woman
must somehow be the victim?

30:02.620 --> 30:05.783
-You asked our opinion.
-Come in with us.

30:05.790 --> 30:07.326
There's one thing
we haven't asked her yet

30:07.330 --> 30:09.286
that might interest you.

30:19.540 --> 30:20.609
Hey!

30:22.500 --> 30:26.118
-That's my dog!
-It's not your dog, buddy. Back off.

30:26.540 --> 30:29.282
Look, I said it's not your dog. Back off!

30:29.290 --> 30:32.453
Hey, will you back off?
It's not your dog!

30:32.460 --> 30:35.452
You son of a bitch!
Stay away from Keri!

30:37.620 --> 30:40.669
No! Help! No! Help!

30:50.120 --> 30:52.076
What the hell happened?

30:52.330 --> 30:54.821
Says some guy in an old brown van
paid him 50 bucks

30:54.830 --> 30:58.459
to walk the dog up and down the street.
Told him to be careful,

30:58.460 --> 31:01.998
someone in the neighborhood
was kidnapping people's pets.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.956
Back door's off its hinges.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.997
Her cell's still in the house, her wallet.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.491
Her purse is on the bed. He just...

31:12.830 --> 31:16.379
He just took her. I was right here.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.701
Let's go inside.

31:22.830 --> 31:23.956
What now?

31:23.960 --> 31:27.418
Well, he finally got her.
He's not about to let her go.

31:38.420 --> 31:39.990
Do you like it?

31:42.330 --> 31:43.991
It's really nice.

31:47.540 --> 31:49.701
How about the pictures of me?

31:51.830 --> 31:54.537
It's good to finally see you in person.

31:56.540 --> 32:00.658
-No, you've seen me before.
-Yeah, yeah, no, I know.

32:00.670 --> 32:01.876
Where?

32:04.670 --> 32:06.661
You mean the first time?

32:07.920 --> 32:09.376
On the 215t?

32:12.500 --> 32:14.320
God, you do remember.

32:16.620 --> 32:18.576
Your haircut looks nice.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.822
-You didn't like it long?
-No. That was good, too.

32:25.920 --> 32:27.456
I've thought about cutting my hair.

32:27.460 --> 32:28.996
No, don't you do that.
Don't you cut your hair!

32:29.000 --> 32:30.786
Do you understand me?

32:31.620 --> 32:34.828
There aren't any vans in Georgia
that have been transferred to Maryland.

32:34.830 --> 32:38.243
So I am sending you registrations
and IDs from both states.

32:38.250 --> 32:39.956
Pictures coming at you.

32:40.750 --> 32:44.163
Let's start with Jeffrey Cramer,
Chris Geezy and Mike Hicks.

32:44.170 --> 32:46.741
Okay. Cramer works at a grocery store.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.457
Geezy is a heating and air tech.

32:49.460 --> 32:52.668
And Hicks is on unemployment.

32:52.670 --> 32:54.160
But he's an IT guy.

32:54.170 --> 32:56.877
Last employed at Legal Grind,
tech support for law firms.

32:56.880 --> 32:59.872
Keri's a lawyer. He might have
worked on her computer.

32:59.880 --> 33:06.035
He has got no criminal record,
and his Social's listed at a bank there.

33:06.040 --> 33:10.488
And the account lists Mike Hicks,
404 Lark Lane, Silver Spring.

33:11.580 --> 33:14.617
Thanks, baby girl.
Well, we got a name and an address.

33:14.620 --> 33:16.872
Would he really take Keri to his place?

33:16.880 --> 33:18.609
It's unlikely,
but we should still check it out.

33:18.620 --> 33:20.531
All right, I'll send a cruiser.

33:20.540 --> 33:23.828
Every second we're here,
she's alone with him.

33:24.620 --> 33:29.319
His obsession with Keri defines him.
He wants to make her happy.

33:29.330 --> 33:30.957
He wouldn't take her
where he wants to go,

33:30.960 --> 33:33.246
he'd take her where she wants to go.

33:33.250 --> 33:36.788
Maybe someplace that
means something to the both of you.

33:37.210 --> 33:39.826
I proposed to her
on Chesapeake Beach.

33:45.830 --> 33:48.572
-Audrey, you know Ms. Alexander.
-Yes.

33:51.330 --> 33:54.743
We'd like for you to take us through
the killing step by step,

33:54.750 --> 33:56.877
as well as you can remember.

34:00.710 --> 34:02.200
I had just...

34:05.420 --> 34:10.540
And I was hanging up
my husband's shirts in the closet.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.787
I looked over and I saw him on the bed.

34:15.790 --> 34:20.159
And I knew it had to be then,
that that was my only chance.

34:21.460 --> 34:24.497
And so I decided I had to kill him.

34:26.790 --> 34:32.319
I picked up the gun and I shot him.

34:41.420 --> 34:46.198
And then you sat there and waited
for someone to come home?

34:46.210 --> 34:48.667
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I had to clean up.

34:48.670 --> 34:51.377
-Why?
-Well, there was blood everywhere.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.668
And did you clean up
to hide what you had done?

34:55.460 --> 34:56.575
No.

34:56.580 --> 34:59.788
No, I was going to tell Sarah
what I had done when she got home.

34:59.790 --> 35:01.826
I wasn't hiding anything.

35:02.830 --> 35:05.458
But then why clean all the blood up?

35:05.460 --> 35:08.281
Because the police were
going to be coming.

35:09.420 --> 35:12.571
Philip would have been furious
ifI allowed all those strangers

35:12.580 --> 35:15.378
into the house with a mess like that.

35:27.580 --> 35:30.037
Her life's been punishment enough.

35:31.420 --> 35:33.490
I'm going to have to drag her
through a trial.

35:33.500 --> 35:36.822
I'll recommend she's charged
with criminally negligent homicide.

35:36.830 --> 35:41.574
By the time it's over, she'll probably
get off with probation and time served.

35:42.250 --> 35:45.208
Thank you for taking me away.

35:46.710 --> 35:49.782
It's a really good place
for us to start over.

35:55.500 --> 35:58.321
Can we take these off
now that we're safe?

36:17.040 --> 36:19.577
God, they're softer than I remember.

36:22.620 --> 36:26.499
When you got up from your desk
and I sat in your chair...

36:28.120 --> 36:32.784
And you, you said, "Oops."

36:40.250 --> 36:43.913
And I knew then. And you felt it, too.

36:57.670 --> 36:59.991
It's kind of stuffy in here.

37:00.880 --> 37:04.998
Let's go for a walk.
We can look at the water.

37:08.040 --> 37:09.075
Yeah.

37:10.080 --> 37:11.115
Okay.

37:36.330 --> 37:38.207
It's so beautiful here.

37:51.120 --> 37:55.284
Okay, okay. Let's put these away.
I just want to talk to you.

37:56.420 --> 37:59.878
-Don't make me hurt her.
-You don't have to do that.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.917
Michael, we don't want
to take her away from you.

38:02.920 --> 38:05.286
Keri told me she wants to be with you.

38:05.290 --> 38:08.578
It's true. I'm so happy now.

38:11.580 --> 38:16.529
They think you're going to hurt me.
Put it down so we can be together.

38:18.960 --> 38:20.871
Where do you want to go first?

38:20.880 --> 38:25.874
We could go back to Atlanta.
We could find a little house.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.161
Come here. Come here!

38:48.170 --> 38:51.287
Take that! Here.

38:52.790 --> 38:54.451
Get up. Get up!

38:56.580 --> 38:58.411
How could you do this?

38:58.420 --> 39:00.820
After everything I've done for us!

39:02.830 --> 39:04.878
They can't keep us apart!

39:08.330 --> 39:09.820
You did great.

39:10.830 --> 39:14.288
He worked on my computer.
That's where I met him.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.325
It's okay.

39:17.210 --> 39:20.247
I found this in his van,
along with about 100 photos of Keri.

39:21.170 --> 39:23.286
February 215t, 2006.

39:23.290 --> 39:25.827
A month later he sent his first letter.

39:25.830 --> 39:28.321
He thought it was their anniversary.

39:29.580 --> 39:32.037
Hey. It's over now.

39:33.250 --> 39:34.615
Thank you.

39:36.790 --> 39:38.746
Susan B. Anthony said,

39:38.750 --> 39:41.742
"A woman must not depend
on the protection of man,

39:41.750 --> 39:44.492
"but must be taught to protect herself."

40:16.170 --> 40:19.071
-Hey, everyone's waiting.
-You should go.

40:20.880 --> 40:24.202
-Keri's going to be okay.
-I know.

40:26.380 --> 40:29.781
Okay, then what is it?
Because you've been a little off.

40:29.790 --> 40:31.997
Really, I'm just... I'm tired.

40:33.380 --> 40:36.781
Okay. Well, go home. Get some sleep.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.321
Hey, it's me. You got a minute?

41:08.750 --> 41:10.490
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.616
We just really need to talk.

41:15.380 --> 41:16.824
I'm pregnant.
