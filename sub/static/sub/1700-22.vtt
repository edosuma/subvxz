00:02.127 --> 00:03.919
- Tell him. Please tell him.
- Tell him.

00:04.086 --> 00:06.380
- Shut up.
- Tell me what?

00:06.548 --> 00:08.882
- You won't even look at him.
- Oh, come on, tell me.

00:09.050 --> 00:12.094
I could use another reason
why women won't look at me.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.762
All right, all right, all right.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.806
Last night, I had a dream...

00:15.974 --> 00:19.476
...that, um, you and I were, uh...

00:19.644 --> 00:21.520
Doing it on this table.

00:22.647 --> 00:26.608
- Wow.
- Excellent dream score.

00:28.987 --> 00:32.113
Why...? Why would you dream that?

00:33.616 --> 00:36.535
More importantly, was I any good?

00:37.954 --> 00:40.664
Well, you were pretty damned good.
Ha, ha.

00:40.832 --> 00:44.293
Interesting, because in my dreams,
I'm surprisingly inadequate.

00:46.379 --> 00:50.049
Well, last night, you seemed to know
your way around the table.

00:53.511 --> 00:55.846
I love it when we share.

00:59.893 --> 01:00.934
You okay there?

01:01.102 --> 01:03.312
I can't believe you two had sex
in her dream.

01:04.980 --> 01:06.857
I'm sorry. It was a one-time thing.

01:07.025 --> 01:10.527
I was very drunk,
and it was someone else's subconscious.

02:00.703 --> 02:02.412
- Hello, Rachel.
- Ugh.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.540
Get off.

02:05.917 --> 02:09.919
Ooh. Oh, give me.
Can you see me operating a drill press?

02:11.422 --> 02:13.590
I don't know. What are you wearing?

02:17.011 --> 02:19.888
Pheebs, why would you want
to operate a drill press?

02:20.056 --> 02:21.431
Just for some short-term work.

02:21.599 --> 02:24.017
You know, till I get back
some of my massage clients.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.103
Pirates again?

02:26.271 --> 02:28.814
No. Nothing like that.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.275
I'm just such a dummy.

02:31.442 --> 02:34.153
I taught this
"Massage Yourself at Home" workshop.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.280
And they are.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.159
Hey, hey, Chan, she could work for you.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.995
Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.206
What? I could. I could do it. What is it?

02:46.374 --> 02:48.041
Well, my secretary's gonna be out.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.335
She's having one of her boobs reduced.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.506
It's a whole big boob story.

02:54.674 --> 02:55.924
I could be a secretary.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.635
Well, I don't know
if it's your kind of thing...

02:58.803 --> 03:01.555
...because, uh,
it involves a lot of being normal...

03:01.723 --> 03:04.391
...ahem, for a large portion of the day.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.685
I could do that.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.230
- What are you playing with?
- It's my new beeper.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.900
Why the hell does a paleontologist
need a beeper for?

03:13.067 --> 03:17.029
Is it, like, for dinosaur emergencies?
"Help, come quick! They're still extinct!"

03:18.573 --> 03:22.075
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor.
She can get me wherever I am.

03:22.243 --> 03:25.954
All she has to do is dial 55-JIMBO.

03:26.789 --> 03:29.374
A cool phone number
and a possible name for the kid.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.128
- I'll see you guys later.
- Off to see young Ethan?

03:33.588 --> 03:35.214
Thank you.

03:35.965 --> 03:39.218
How young is young Ethan? Young?

03:39.385 --> 03:41.762
He's our age.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.014
When we were?

03:47.268 --> 03:49.686
- Okay, he's a senior in college.
- College?

03:49.896 --> 03:51.396
- Ooh.
- Whoa.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.816
And this man-child has no problem
with how old you are?

03:55.026 --> 03:56.318
No, of course not.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.320
It's not even an issue...

03:58.488 --> 04:00.405
...because I told him I was 22.

04:00.573 --> 04:01.865
- What?
- What?

04:02.033 --> 04:05.744
- Oh, I can't pass for 22?
- Well, maybe 25, 26.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.538
- I am 26.
- There you go.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.095
Can you hear that?

04:23.846 --> 04:25.347
Yeah. Ha, ha.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.101
That'll stop when you pick up the phone.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.061
Oh. Ha, ha.

04:31.229 --> 04:35.065
- Okay. Ooh, I'm on.
- Okay.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.443
Mr. Bing's office.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.447
No, I'm sorry,
he's in a meeting right now.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.324
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right...

04:44.492 --> 04:47.160
Will he know what this is in reference to?

04:47.328 --> 04:48.996
And he has your number?

04:49.205 --> 04:51.957
All right, I'll see that he gets the message.
Bye-bye.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.420
- What?
- Ross says hi.

04:56.587 --> 04:57.879
Ah.

04:58.047 --> 05:00.674
This is so fun.
All right, what do we do now?

05:00.883 --> 05:03.885
Well, now I actually have to get to work.

05:04.053 --> 05:05.721
"Most likely."

05:09.684 --> 05:11.977
- Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
- Okay.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.981
- All right. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

05:21.529 --> 05:22.571
Yes?

05:22.739 --> 05:24.448
What you doing?

05:27.452 --> 05:30.996
Okay, windows are clean,
candles are lit.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.332
Ooh, belt's too tight. Gotta change the belt.

05:33.499 --> 05:36.626
Did I turn the fish?
Nope, because I made lasagna.

05:38.087 --> 05:41.965
- Am I out of control?
- Just a touch.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.258
Mon, I don't understand.

05:43.426 --> 05:47.346
I mean, you've been dating this guy since,
like, his midterms.

05:47.513 --> 05:51.391
I mean,
why all of a sudden are you so?

05:52.935 --> 05:55.145
Oh.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.980
What?

05:57.148 --> 05:59.941
Could tonight be the night?

06:01.527 --> 06:02.694
I don't know.

06:02.862 --> 06:08.200
Look, he's a great guy,
and I love being with him, but, you know...

06:08.368 --> 06:09.951
...things happen when they happen.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.620
You don't plan these things.

06:13.748 --> 06:16.291
- Oh. So did you shave your legs?
- Yeah.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.709
Uh-huh.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.507
Would you let it go, Ross?
It was just a dream.

06:23.716 --> 06:24.800
It doesn't mean...

06:26.177 --> 06:29.721
Oh, oh, oh. Oh, this is it. Oh, my God.
It's baby time. Baby time.

06:29.889 --> 06:33.266
All right, relax, relax, just relax, just relax.
Be cool.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.812
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped.

06:38.147 --> 06:42.901
No, Andre is not here. Third time today.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.153
Yes, I am sure.

06:45.321 --> 06:49.324
Heh. No, sir, I do not perform
those kind of services.

06:49.492 --> 06:53.078
Services? Oh, services.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.373
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.043
Yeah.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.753
That's right.

07:01.921 --> 07:05.006
That's right. "JUMBO" with a U, sir.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.758
Heh. No, you don't want me.

07:06.926 --> 07:10.387
Judging by his number,
I'd be a huge disappointment.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.682
Yeah. Alrighty, bye-bye.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.146
- Hey, hey. How was the first day?
- Hey. Oh.

07:19.313 --> 07:22.858
Excellent. Everyone was so, so nice.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.527
See? It pays to know the man
who wears my shoes.

07:26.737 --> 07:28.488
- Me.
- Ah.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.284
- I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
- Why not?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.536
Well, because, you know.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.997
They don't like you.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.586
- What?
- I thought you knew that.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.087
Nah-uh.

07:45.506 --> 07:48.675
- Who doesn't like me?
- Everyone.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.552
Except for, um...

07:50.720 --> 07:52.721
No. Everyone.

07:55.099 --> 07:58.101
- What are you talking about?
- Don't feel bad.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.729
You know, they used to like you a lot.

08:00.897 --> 08:04.483
But then you got promoted,
and now you're all, like, Mr. Boss-Man.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.277
You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing.
Boss-Man Bing.

08:10.114 --> 08:13.575
- I can't believe it.
- Yeah, yeah. They even do you.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.120
- They do me?
- Yeah.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.581
You know, like, um, okay:

08:19.749 --> 08:21.374
"Could that report be any later?"

08:27.798 --> 08:28.924
I don't sound like that.

08:29.175 --> 08:32.260
- Oh, oh. Chandler.
- Oh. Yeah, you do.

08:32.428 --> 08:35.554
"The hills are alive with the sound...

08:35.722 --> 08:37.599
...of music."

08:43.022 --> 08:44.063
"My scone!"

08:44.232 --> 08:45.857
ROSS, JOEY & PHOEBE:
"My scone!"

08:48.236 --> 08:50.612
Okay, I don't sound like that.
That is so not true.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.493
That is so not... That is so not... That...

08:56.661 --> 08:58.119
Oh, shut up.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.457
Ha, ha. You did not.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.584
I am telling you, up until I was 9...

09:04.752 --> 09:07.587
...I thought gunpoint was an actual place
where crimes happened.

09:07.755 --> 09:11.424
- Ha, ha. How is that possible?
- Think about it. It's always on the news.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.261
"A man is being held up at Gunpoint."

09:14.428 --> 09:16.805
"Tourists are being terrorized
at Gunpoint."

09:17.014 --> 09:20.475
And I just kept thinking,
"Why do people continue to go there?"

09:24.105 --> 09:25.897
Oh, ah.

09:26.065 --> 09:29.776
- I should go.
- Okay.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.908
Okay.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.285
- Unless...
- What?

09:39.245 --> 09:42.539
Uh, unless you wanna stay over.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.499
I mean, I'm going to. So...

09:47.169 --> 09:49.337
Yeah, I'd really like that.

09:55.469 --> 10:01.016
Uh, before we get into
any staying-over stuff...

10:01.183 --> 10:03.476
...there's something you should know.

10:03.644 --> 10:06.146
Okay. Is this like
"I have an early class tomorrow"...

10:06.314 --> 10:09.899
...or "I'm secretly married to a goat"?

10:10.109 --> 10:13.862
Well, it's somewhere in between.

10:14.071 --> 10:18.325
You see, in a strictly technical sense,
of course, I'm not, uh...

10:18.492 --> 10:21.453
Well, I mean, I haven't ever, um...

10:21.621 --> 10:23.413
- Ethan?
- Yeah?

10:23.581 --> 10:24.873
Are you a virgin?

10:25.082 --> 10:28.835
Well, if that's what you kids
are calling it these days...

10:29.003 --> 10:30.629
...then yes, I am.

10:33.549 --> 10:37.052
I, uh... I've kind of been waiting
for the right person.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.222
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.934
You do know
I was talking about you, right?

10:53.861 --> 10:55.278
Wow.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.906
You keep saying that.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.951
You know, you read about it.
You see it in the movies.

11:02.119 --> 11:05.955
Even when you practice it at home,
man, oh, man...

11:06.123 --> 11:08.917
...it is nothing like that.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.126
Oh.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.047
Listen, listen.

11:14.715 --> 11:19.552
Um, you told me something
that was really difficult for you.

11:19.762 --> 11:23.932
And, um, well, I figure if you can be honest,
then I can too.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.769
- Oh, God, don't tell me I did it wrong.
- No.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.479
- No, no, no.
- Oh.

11:29.647 --> 11:32.732
- Nothing wrong about that.
- Oh. Ha, ha.

11:33.401 --> 11:37.070
Um, okay. Here goes.

11:38.155 --> 11:40.407
I'm not 22.

11:40.574 --> 11:43.243
I'm 25.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.662
And 13 months.

11:47.581 --> 11:48.790
Huh.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.126
But I figure, you know,
that shouldn't change anything.

11:51.293 --> 11:54.796
I mean, what the hell does it matter
how old we are?

11:57.466 --> 11:59.134
Listen, um...

11:59.301 --> 12:01.469
...as long as we're telling stuff, uh...

12:03.472 --> 12:05.974
...I have another one for you.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.852
I'm a little younger than I said.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.605
You're not a senior?

12:12.773 --> 12:15.024
Oh, I'm a senior.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.696
In high school.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.830
Okay.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.043
What we did was wrong.

12:34.211 --> 12:38.965
Oh, God. I just had sex with someone
who wasn't alive during the bicentennial.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.094
I just had sex.

12:45.181 --> 12:48.516
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?

12:48.684 --> 12:51.352
- You never told me how old you were.
- That's different.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.856
My lie didn't make one of us a felon
in 48 states.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.527
- What were you thinking?
- I wasn't thinking. I was busy falling...

12:59.695 --> 13:01.780
- Don't say it.
...in love with you.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.783
Really?

13:04.950 --> 13:06.951
Sorry.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.162
Well, fall out of it.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.749
You know, you shouldn't even be here.
It's a school night.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.669
Oh, God. Oh, God.

13:16.837 --> 13:22.091
I'm like those women that you see
with shiny guys named Chad.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.055
I'm Joan Collins.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.518
Who?

13:39.735 --> 13:43.321
Okay, Andre should be there
in about 45 minutes.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.699
Alrighty. Bye-bye.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.620
Ahem. It's just easier that way.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.791
Oh, come on.
You told me about the last dream.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.751
No. Forget it.

13:56.919 --> 14:00.755
Well, why not?
Was I doing something particularly saucy?

14:02.967 --> 14:06.135
All right, fine. Um...

14:06.303 --> 14:08.263
Well, you were not the only one there.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.891
Joey was there too.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.936
All right.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.565
Was there, uh, heh...

14:21.569 --> 14:23.903
...anybody else there?

14:24.071 --> 14:26.155
- No.
- You sure?

14:26.323 --> 14:30.618
Nobody, uh, handing out mints
or anything?

14:32.371 --> 14:33.955
No, it was just the three of us.

14:34.665 --> 14:35.748
Oh.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.836
So tell me, was it like you and Chandler
and then you and me...

14:40.004 --> 14:41.379
...or you and me and Chandler?

14:43.841 --> 14:46.467
- You know what?
- What?

14:46.635 --> 14:48.636
There were times...

14:48.804 --> 14:51.055
...when it wasn't even me.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.485
That is so sweet, you guys.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.699
- Hey, Mon.
- Mon.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.326
Mon, Ethan called again.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.122
Mon?

15:16.290 --> 15:18.041
Mon!

15:19.293 --> 15:21.336
- What?
- Ethan called again.

15:21.545 --> 15:22.670
Oh.

15:22.838 --> 15:25.924
- You're not seeing him anymore?
- No.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.468
You know,
sometimes just things don't work out.

15:28.636 --> 15:32.847
And this has nothing to do with the fact
that he needs a note to get out of gym?

15:36.977 --> 15:40.104
I didn't say any...
I did not say anything, I swear.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.606
He stopped by.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.191
Next time you talk to him...

15:43.359 --> 15:47.362
...could you ask him which one
the strongest Power Ranger is?

15:49.531 --> 15:53.326
Oh, my life is just so amusing. Heh, heh.
Can we drop it now?

15:53.494 --> 15:54.744
Sorry. Sorry.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.871
It's morphing time.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.581
- Stegosaurus!
- Tyrannosaurus!

16:03.796 --> 16:05.338
Ooh. Oh, I gotta go.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.715
Whoa. Ooh, head rush. Oh.

16:09.551 --> 16:12.178
One more and then I have to go.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.554
Cool. Ha, ha.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.018
Where you going?

16:19.186 --> 16:21.729
Oh, I got a birthday party
with some work people.

16:21.897 --> 16:23.606
Work people?

16:24.525 --> 16:26.442
- Nobody told me.
- No, I know.

16:26.610 --> 16:30.697
That's part of the whole, you know,
them-not-liking-you extravaganza.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.119
Know what? I don't get this.
A month ago, these people were my friends.

16:36.286 --> 16:39.247
Just because I'm in charge,
doesn't mean I'm a different person.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.250
Well, then you should come tonight,
just hang out with them.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.419
Let them see
what a great guy you still are.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.671
- You think I should?
- I really do, yeah.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.715
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.466
Oh, but, um, could we not go together?

16:52.177 --> 16:55.596
I don't wanna be the geek
who invited the boss, you know?

16:58.892 --> 17:00.393
I think last night was great.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.104
You know, the karaoke thing?
Tracy and I doing "Ebony and lvory"?

17:03.272 --> 17:04.355
- Mm-hm.
- Ha, ha.

17:04.522 --> 17:07.316
You were great.
But they still made fun of you.

17:07.984 --> 17:10.862
- What?
- Now you're more like Mr. Caring-Boss.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.530
Mr. "I'm-One-of-You" -Boss.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.532
Mr. "I-Wanna-Be-Your-Buddy" -
Boss-Man-Bing.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.703
Then I don't get it.

17:19.413 --> 17:23.207
Well, you know what, Chandler?
I think you just gotta face it.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.835
You're, like, the guy in the big office,
you know?

17:26.045 --> 17:28.963
You're the one that hires them
and fires them.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.841
- They still say you're a great boss.
- They do?

17:32.009 --> 17:33.092
Uh-huh.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.511
But they're not your friends anymore.

17:35.679 --> 17:37.555
- But I just want to...
- No, but you can't.

17:38.640 --> 17:39.891
- But I just want...
- Ah-ah.

17:50.736 --> 17:51.778
Aren't you gonna...?

17:51.945 --> 17:53.529
Oh, Carol and I have a new system.

17:53.697 --> 17:57.450
If she punches in "911,"
it means she's having a baby.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.870
- Otherwise, I just ignore it.
- What about Andre?

18:01.038 --> 18:04.123
This morning he got a call
from what I think was our cousin Nathan.

18:04.291 --> 18:07.043
And frankly,
it was a little more than I needed to know.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.134
Hey.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.220
That was gonna be my opener.

18:18.472 --> 18:22.475
Hey, did you guys check out
those new hand dryers in the bathroom?

18:22.643 --> 18:25.394
- I thought that was just a rumor.
- True story.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.359
All right, look, I gotta tell you something.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.610
I'm not 17.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.446
I only said that
so you'd think I was cute and vulnerable.

18:35.614 --> 18:36.864
I'm actually 30.

18:37.032 --> 18:40.451
I have a wife. I have a job.
I'm your congressman.

18:41.411 --> 18:44.038
Monica, this is ridiculous.
We are great together.

18:44.206 --> 18:47.792
We can talk, we make each other laugh.
And the sex. Oh, man.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.295
Okay, I have no frame of reference,
but I thought that was great.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.340
- It was.
- Then what's the problem?

18:57.010 --> 18:59.011
Ethan, it's, um...

19:00.973 --> 19:02.056
It's icky.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.725
Icky?

19:04.893 --> 19:08.479
You're actually gonna throw this away
because it's icky?

19:09.648 --> 19:11.816
Look, this isn't easy for me either.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.568
I wish things were different.

19:13.735 --> 19:16.571
If you were a few years older
or I was a few years younger...

19:16.738 --> 19:19.323
...or we lived in biblical times...

19:20.450 --> 19:22.869
...I could really...
- No, don't say it.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.245
- Love you.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.960
- Are your hands still wet?
- They're moist.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.254
- Yeah, right? Ahem.
- Let's dry them again.

19:38.969 --> 19:42.722
Or, like, "Could these margaritas
be any stronger?"

19:44.850 --> 19:47.643
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hello, Mr. Bing.

19:47.811 --> 19:50.271
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.

19:51.899 --> 19:55.359
Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers,
I'm gonna need them on my desk...

19:55.527 --> 19:57.153
...by 9:00.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.989
- Sure.
- No problem.

20:02.492 --> 20:04.410
You have to give them something,
you know?

20:04.578 --> 20:07.830
Okay, that was Gerston, Santos,
and who's the guy with the mustache?

20:07.998 --> 20:09.999
- Petrie.
- Petrie. Right, right, okay.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.877
Well, some people
are gonna be working...

20:13.045 --> 20:14.086
...this weekend.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.160
Oh, that's nice.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.876
Ross.

21:02.552 --> 21:05.304
- Ross?
- I'm here.

21:07.224 --> 21:08.724
You are?

21:11.478 --> 21:12.895
Uh... Ahem.

21:13.063 --> 21:16.399
We were just...

21:16.566 --> 21:18.025
- Wow.
- What?

21:21.029 --> 21:23.614
Heh. Great. Now I'm having a baby.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.325
- What?
- Oh!

21:26.493 --> 21:28.411
- No. I'm having... I'm having a baby!
- Oh. Oh!

21:28.578 --> 21:29.912
- Oh, my God.
- I'm having a...!

21:30.080 --> 21:32.957
- The phone, the phone!
- The phone. I don't have the phone. Aah!

21:35.877 --> 21:38.796
- Ross?
- I'm hurt.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.178
Monica, let's go.
Come on, now, people. Woman in labor.

21:46.346 --> 21:50.099
- Hey, Ross, look what I got going here.
- Yeah, save it for the cab, okay?

21:50.726 --> 21:53.185
What are you doing?
We're going to a hospital.

21:53.353 --> 21:56.564
What, so I can't look nice?
There might be doctors there.

21:56.732 --> 22:00.109
- Joey, get out of the fridge.
- All right, all right.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.695
- What is that?
- For the ride.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.530
- Yeah, like in a cab you...
- Save it.

22:04.698 --> 22:07.992
- Okay, hating this.
- Monica, come on, now. Let's go.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.201
Baby coming. God.

22:09.369 --> 22:11.495
I can't believe it. I'm gonna be an aunt.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.581
- Oh, that's...
- I'm gonna have a nephew.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.458
Oh, that's nice. Get out.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.710
- Come on.
- Let's go, come on.

22:17.878 --> 22:18.919
Okay. Okay.

22:19.087 --> 22:21.339
All right, all right, I'm going, I'm going.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.723
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Rossy. Rossy.
