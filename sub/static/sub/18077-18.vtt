00:07.821 --> 00:09.846
My father is into him
for $30,000.

00:09.923 --> 00:11.686
We need a man
on the inside.

the A-Team decides
to show up.

00:19.433 --> 00:21.401
This estabIishment
is cIosed down.

00:21.468 --> 00:22.901
We had a IittIe
troubIe IateIy...

00:22.969 --> 00:24.960
so we're gonna take
our action on the road.

In 1972,
a crack commando unit...

00:35.916 --> 00:37.508
was sent to prison
by a military court...

00:37.584 --> 00:39.108
for a crime
they didn't commit.

00:39.186 --> 00:40.551
These men promptly escaped...

00:40.620 --> 00:42.212
from a maximum-security
stockade...

00:42.289 --> 00:43.756
to the Los Angeles
underground.

00:43.824 --> 00:45.485
Today, still wanted
by the government...

00:45.559 --> 00:47.459
they survive
as soldiers of fortune.

00:47.527 --> 00:49.927
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

00:49.996 --> 00:51.122
and if you can find them...

00:51.198 --> 00:53.564
maybe you can hire
the A-Team.

You know, I can remember

03:04.731 --> 03:06.460

No! SaIIy gets

on the fIoor, okay?

03:30.056 --> 03:30.988
Right.

03:31.057 --> 03:34.185
Right. And use your napkins,
not the tabIecIoth...

03:34.261 --> 03:36.695

Okay. AII right, gang,
give me your pIates.

03:45.038 --> 03:46.130
Yes?

03:46.606 --> 03:49.268
We came by to see
GentIeman Jim.
Is he around?

03:49.509 --> 03:52.808
Uh, may I teII him what
this is in reference to?

03:52.879 --> 03:54.847
We came by to coIIect

03:54.915 --> 03:56.212
Dad, do you know
these men?

03:56.283 --> 03:59.343
Look, honey, I'II handIe this.
Why don't you see
what the kids are doing?

03:59.419 --> 04:00.386
I wiII not!

04:00.453 --> 04:02.614
Mr. Royce asked us to drop by.

04:03.189 --> 04:05.089
He wants the $30,000
you owe him.

04:05.158 --> 04:07.058
Dad, what's this aII about?

04:07.127 --> 04:09.459
Your oId man was unIucky
at the crap tabIe.

04:09.529 --> 04:11.019
Dad, you promised me...
Honey--

04:11.097 --> 04:13.725
you wouIdn't gambIe anymore.
You said you were through
with that.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.995
You don't have the bread
to cover the marker,
huh, pops?

04:16.069 --> 04:17.593

No! Leave him aIone.

04:23.510 --> 04:25.842

have to get
physicaI for, huh?

04:25.912 --> 04:27.880
You hear me threaten
to break your kneecaps?

04:27.948 --> 04:31.406
No, we just came by
to coIIect on an
outstanding debt, that's aII.

04:31.618 --> 04:32.846
You won't sign,
though, huh?

04:32.919 --> 04:36.821
Maybe a guy with
your kind of Iuck is IiabIe to
faII off a pier or something.

04:37.090 --> 04:39.581
Or, your daughter here,
run into a car.

04:51.771 --> 04:53.295
No, Dad, don't.

04:55.175 --> 04:57.803

of next week to move out...

05:03.249 --> 05:06.685
and don't make us
have to evict you.
You know what I mean?

05:07.253 --> 05:08.311
Come on.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.313
Excuse me.

05:41.821 --> 05:43.049
Damn.

05:43.156 --> 05:46.887
You didn't happen to see
anyone waiting at this tabIe
over here, number 6?

05:46.960 --> 05:48.552
Yeah, there was
a feIIow over there.

05:48.628 --> 05:50.892
He went to the phone,
he'II be right back.

05:57.537 --> 06:01.132
Excuse me, I'd go
for the 6-baII, bank it
into the side pocket.

06:01.641 --> 06:03.506
You know a Iot
about pooI, huh, miss?

06:03.710 --> 06:04.972
Yes, I do.

06:05.045 --> 06:06.205
Bug off.

06:06.279 --> 06:08.509
Sorry. I didn't mean
to sound Iike an expert.

06:08.581 --> 06:09.707
WeII, you did.

06:11.484 --> 06:15.147
You wanted me to shoot
the 6-baII on a bank
in the side pocket.

06:15.955 --> 06:17.684
I think it's a better shot.

06:18.858 --> 06:20.985
7-baII, corner pocket.

06:22.562 --> 06:23.688
[excIaiming]

06:23.763 --> 06:25.025
Damn.

06:25.565 --> 06:28.534
Say, if you had to shoot
this next shot...

06:28.601 --> 06:30.262
what wouId you shoot?

06:31.037 --> 06:34.700
I'd go for a combination,
5-baII off the 4-baII
into the corner pocket.

06:35.141 --> 06:36.574
5-baII off
the 4-baII?

06:36.643 --> 06:37.632
Mmm-hmm.

06:37.711 --> 06:39.542
WeII, you gonna
step in here
and show me...

06:39.612 --> 06:41.546
or are you one of those
tire-kickers...

06:41.614 --> 06:43.275
whose advice
isn't worth a nickeI?

06:43.349 --> 06:44.646
AII right.

06:49.856 --> 06:50.880
5-baII.

06:55.662 --> 06:58.256
If I hadn't seen it,
I wouIdn't have beIieved it.

06:59.632 --> 07:02.567
Your daddy sure taught you
how to pIay pooI,
Miss SuIIivan.

07:04.971 --> 07:07.098
Now, if you're Iookin'
for the A-Team...

07:07.173 --> 07:08.162
you found it.

07:10.410 --> 07:13.243
I'm HannibaI Smith.
How do you do?

07:16.583 --> 07:17.709
Miss SuIIivan...

07:17.784 --> 07:21.049
the reason for
the eIaborate make-up was
to be sure that you were...

07:21.121 --> 07:24.682
GentIeman Jim SuIIivan's
daughter and not a spy
for the miIitary.

07:24.791 --> 07:26.952
Mr. Smith, what if I didn't
make that shot?

07:27.026 --> 07:29.426
But you did.
Now, you toId Mr. Lee...

07:29.696 --> 07:31.823
that you and your father
run a foster home...

07:31.898 --> 07:35.493
that your father was
forced to sign over
to a man named Royce.

07:35.702 --> 07:38.603
Johnny Royce,
he runs an iIIegaI
gambIing operation.

07:38.938 --> 07:41.463
My father's into him
for $30,000.

07:41.674 --> 07:43.665
But didn't I read
somewhere that...

07:44.177 --> 07:46.236
he retired,
that he'd never gambIe again.

07:46.312 --> 07:47.939
And he hasn't for years...

07:48.782 --> 07:52.343
that is, untiI he Iost
his job with the miII
when they shut down.

07:52.418 --> 07:53.612
(Patty)
Dad was afraid we couIdn't...

07:53.686 --> 07:56.018
scrape together enough money
for this month's mortgage.

07:56.089 --> 07:57.954
Yeah, and he thought
he couId win it.

07:58.525 --> 08:00.186
Someone steered him
to Royce.

08:00.260 --> 08:01.818
(Murdock)
Honey, can I stop you
for a minute?

08:01.895 --> 08:03.658
I just want to say
that I think that...

08:03.730 --> 08:06.961
it's wonderfuI,
what you're doin'
in the foster home.

08:07.033 --> 08:11.094
And I suspect that
you and your father must have
a very strong reIationship.

08:11.171 --> 08:14.629
You must heIp each other
with a Iot of positive
reinforcement.

08:14.941 --> 08:16.533
What you taIkin'
about, Murdock?

08:16.609 --> 08:18.440
I'm taIkin' about peopIe
Iike this Iady here...

08:18.511 --> 08:22.072
getting things done
the right way
with team support...

08:22.148 --> 08:25.413
constructive feedback,
and praise for a job
weII done.

08:25.652 --> 08:28.712
My father and I run
a home for five IoneIy...

08:28.788 --> 08:30.278
and frightened chiIdren.

08:30.356 --> 08:31.721
We've managed
to reach them...

08:31.791 --> 08:33.554
to get them
to trust us...

08:33.626 --> 08:35.991
and more importantIy,
trust each other.

08:36.062 --> 08:37.996
For the first time
in their Iives...

08:38.063 --> 08:40.328
the worId doesn't Iook
Iike a pIace that
these chiIdren...

08:40.400 --> 08:41.890
wouId rather run away from.

08:41.967 --> 08:43.230
(Patty)
If Royce evicts us...

08:43.303 --> 08:45.567
I don't know
what wiII happen
to our famiIy.

08:45.638 --> 08:48.106
You've got to heIp us
get our home back.

08:49.375 --> 08:51.070
Whatever it costs us...

08:52.512 --> 08:54.343
I'II find a way to pay you.

08:56.883 --> 09:00.979
Oh, weII, I don't think
we have to worry about
payment right now, do we?

09:01.287 --> 09:04.017
That's right.
We wiII do the job
for nothing.

09:04.457 --> 09:07.153
There you go, B.A.
You see, you agreed
with Faceman...

09:07.227 --> 09:09.627
and you Iet him know.
That's positive reinforcement.

09:09.696 --> 09:12.392
That's two members
of the team interfacing.

09:12.465 --> 09:14.023
WeII, Miss SuIIivan...

09:14.100 --> 09:15.692
it Iooks Iike
you just hired the A-Team.

09:25.345 --> 09:26.903
(HannibaI)
I've been doing some
checkin'...

09:26.980 --> 09:29.710
and our friend, Royce,
has got his fingers in
a Iot of pies...

09:29.782 --> 09:32.273
but gambIing
is his main operation.

09:32.719 --> 09:36.018
We sIam the Iid on that,
we put him out of business.

09:36.089 --> 09:39.149
Yeah, and then Patty
and her father get the deed
to their home back.

09:39.225 --> 09:41.159
That's great.
Now, aII we need...

09:41.227 --> 09:44.128
is an invitation
from Royce to come down
and try our Iuck.

09:44.197 --> 09:45.858
You got a pIan, HannibaI?

09:45.932 --> 09:48.127
Yeah. We need a man
on the inside.

09:48.201 --> 09:52.331
Someone to teII us
where and when
Royce opens his casino.

09:56.175 --> 09:58.268
Oh, come on. No, guys.

09:58.344 --> 10:00.574
You don't expect me
to go in there.

10:02.115 --> 10:03.275
Right?

10:04.851 --> 10:06.011
Right.

10:11.190 --> 10:12.452
Hey, we're not open yet.

10:12.525 --> 10:13.549
Don't mind me.

10:13.626 --> 10:15.856
I just got to put
some new records
in the jukebox, here.

10:15.929 --> 10:17.191
WeII, make it snappy.

10:17.263 --> 10:20.596
We're gonna open soon
and the customers Iike
to use the box.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.328
I thought Mickey
changes the records?

10:22.402 --> 10:24.597
Yeah, weII, I'm the new guy
from Jersey.

10:24.671 --> 10:27.299
I mean, Mr. Tommy NapIes,
he gave me this job.

10:27.373 --> 10:29.068
Oh, yeah? That's terrific.

10:29.142 --> 10:30.939
Tommy's heIped a Iot
of peopIe.

10:31.010 --> 10:33.274
Yeah. I got a Iot
of respect for Mr. NapIes...

10:33.346 --> 10:35.712
onIy, uh, he didn't do me
no favors...

10:35.782 --> 10:37.477
giving me this one.
You know what I mean?

10:37.550 --> 10:40.576
At Ieast in New Jersey I was
running a nightcIub for him.

10:40.954 --> 10:43.252
I mean, I'm a mover
and a shaker, you know?

10:43.323 --> 10:45.382
Then I come out here,
and what happens?

10:45.825 --> 10:48.589
Look at me,
I'm putting records
in a jukebox!

10:48.661 --> 10:52.256
I mean, had I known that,
I wouIdn't have come out here,
I'II teII you that much.

10:52.332 --> 10:53.697
WouId you Iisten
to this guy?

10:53.766 --> 10:55.063
And by the way...

10:55.301 --> 10:56.700
Mr. Royce,
I want you to know...

10:56.769 --> 10:58.737
it's a reaI pIeasure
meetin' you.

11:01.741 --> 11:03.709
I think you're the best...

11:03.776 --> 11:06.142
and if there's ever an opening
in your organization--

11:06.212 --> 11:08.874
WeII, I don't know
if I want to give
an opening to a guy...

11:08.948 --> 11:11.746
who wants to jump out on a guy
that just gave him a job.

11:12.051 --> 11:14.611
No, hey, I wouId never
do nothing Iike that...

11:14.687 --> 11:16.678
without cIearing it
with Mr. NapIes first.

11:16.756 --> 11:18.417
I mean, I want you
to know that, Mr. Royce.

11:18.491 --> 11:20.288
Oh, I'II remember that.

11:20.860 --> 11:23.624
Now, why don't you
go back and put the records
in the jukebox?

11:23.696 --> 11:25.288
Oh, yeah, right.

11:26.199 --> 11:27.632
Put this stuff in the safe.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.463
[tires screeching]

11:42.415 --> 11:43.473
(Murdock)
Okay, sister...

11:43.549 --> 11:46.347
Iet me see how fast you can
get your taiI out
from behind that bar...

11:46.419 --> 11:48.444
and against this waII.
I want to see your back, paI.

11:48.521 --> 11:49.852
And Ioverboy,
you're in my game pIan.

11:49.922 --> 11:51.082
Okay, what do you guys want?

11:51.157 --> 11:52.988
You got too much
money, Johnny.

11:54.427 --> 11:57.362
(Face)
Hey, Iisten, get the gun out
of my back.

11:57.430 --> 11:58.522
We decided we'd give you...

11:58.598 --> 12:00.190
something
to contribute to.

12:00.566 --> 12:01.555
Us.

12:02.035 --> 12:04.595
I move to the beat
of a different drummer,
sonny.

12:05.571 --> 12:06.629
Now...

12:07.607 --> 12:09.370
we wouIdn't want you
to forget us...

12:09.442 --> 12:12.275
so we're gonna Ieave you
a IittIe remembrance.

12:12.612 --> 12:13.636
B.A.?

12:15.715 --> 12:17.148
[gIasses breaking]

12:17.550 --> 12:18.642
Nice.

12:28.461 --> 12:29.826
[both grunting]

12:29.896 --> 12:30.885
Sorry, paI.

12:34.767 --> 12:36.735
That's okay, Johnny.
See you around.

12:45.678 --> 12:47.475
[tires screeching]

12:50.817 --> 12:52.944
I can't beIieve a bunch
of punks wouId come in here...

12:53.019 --> 12:54.714
Iooking for
a few hundred doIIars
and a ring.

12:54.787 --> 12:56.345
I guess they don't know
whose pIace this is.

12:56.422 --> 12:58.322
Hey, are you okay?
Can you stand up?

12:58.391 --> 13:00.791
Boy, that guy can hit.

13:00.860 --> 13:02.122
[groans]

13:02.195 --> 13:03.457
Maybe Tommy did make
a mistake.

13:03.529 --> 13:05.292
Maybe he's got you
in the wrong business.

13:05.364 --> 13:07.025
(Royce)
A guy with your
kind of moxie...

13:07.100 --> 13:09.068
shouIdn't be putting
records in a jukebox.

13:09.135 --> 13:11.535
I'm gonna taIk to Tommy,
see what I can do.

13:11.604 --> 13:15.005
Oh, gee, that's terrific.
Thanks, Mr. Royce.

13:15.074 --> 13:16.974
Hey, I'm not making
any promises.

13:17.043 --> 13:18.874
I'm just, Iike, Iookin'
to do the right thing.

13:18.945 --> 13:21.413
What's your name?
Russ Dorcette.

13:21.848 --> 13:24.282
Mr. Royce, we don't
need any more heIp.

13:24.350 --> 13:25.749
I'II decide that.

14:26.546 --> 14:27.706
[phone ringing]
It's coming through.

14:27.780 --> 14:28.872
[phone rings]

14:28.948 --> 14:30.540
Mr. NapIes' residence.

14:31.751 --> 14:32.945
(Tony)
Hello?

14:33.019 --> 14:34.043
[birds chirping]

14:35.087 --> 14:36.145
HeIIo?

14:36.222 --> 14:38.713
This is Johnny Royce.
Let me taIk to Mr. NapIes.

14:38.824 --> 14:41.315
Does he know
what this is aII about?

14:41.394 --> 14:44.830
He knows who I am.
We did some business together
in Chicago once.

14:44.897 --> 14:47.365
Yeah, yeah, what was
the name again?

14:47.433 --> 14:49.094
Royce, Johnny Royce.

14:49.302 --> 14:50.963
Yeah, aII right,
hoId on here...

14:51.037 --> 14:53.471
and I'II see if he's around.
Okay? HoId on.

14:54.207 --> 14:55.799
(Murdock)
AII yours, CoIoneI.

14:57.843 --> 15:00.676
This is Tommy.
Listen, I got a bad coId...

15:01.681 --> 15:04.548
and my ears are pIugged up,
so speak cIear, huh?

15:04.617 --> 15:06.312
Hey, Tommy, it's Johnny.

15:06.385 --> 15:07.716
Long time no see.

15:08.087 --> 15:11.113
Hey, Tommy, you've got a kid
working for you...

15:11.190 --> 15:12.487
named Russ Dorcette.

15:12.558 --> 15:13.889
[coughing]

15:15.161 --> 15:16.287
Yeah.

15:16.762 --> 15:19.356
WeII, things are kind
of tight around here.

15:19.432 --> 15:22.094
I haven't got a pIace
for him yet.
But I got my eye on him.

15:22.168 --> 15:24.636
Hey, weII, actuaIIy,
that's why I caIIed.

15:24.704 --> 15:28.105
I think I got an opening
for this kid
in my operation.

15:28.174 --> 15:29.505
[phone beeping]

15:30.409 --> 15:32.036
We got a tap on the Iine.

15:36.182 --> 15:39.174
Yeah, weII, Iet me know
how the kid works out.
Okay?

15:39.252 --> 15:40.514
Okay.

15:50.496 --> 15:52.088
Man, we got troubIe.

15:53.833 --> 15:56.199
They must've found the tap.
Let's get out of here.

15:57.470 --> 15:58.459
[tires screeching]

15:59.205 --> 16:00.194
[guns firing]

16:14.687 --> 16:17.178
Look, I think I found somebody
in Royce's organization...

16:17.256 --> 16:18.245
I can make a move on.

16:18.324 --> 16:19.552
Terrific, Face.

16:19.625 --> 16:22.116
I found out all these guys
wear tuxedoes
at the gambling place.

16:22.194 --> 16:23.991
If I get taken in,
I'll need one.

16:24.063 --> 16:25.792
(Hannibal)
There's a storefront
on 16th Street.

16:25.865 --> 16:27.890
The tuxedo shop wiII be
in the middIe of the bIock.

16:27.967 --> 16:28.956
[door opening]

16:29.035 --> 16:31.697
(Face)
Yeah, okay, Ma, okay.
Look, don't worry.

16:32.571 --> 16:35.904
Mr. NapIes introduced me
to some reaI nice peopIe
down here.

16:37.843 --> 16:39.276
Yeah, I Iove you too, Ma.

16:41.881 --> 16:43.246
What're you Iookin' at?

16:43.849 --> 16:45.544
Thanks for the heIp,
Mr. Smith.

16:45.751 --> 16:46.877
Patty's right.

16:46.952 --> 16:49.512
Much as I hate to say it,
there's no way
we couId've stood up...

16:49.588 --> 16:51.215
against Royce
and his apes aIone.

16:51.290 --> 16:54.020
WeII, that's our business,
fixing guys Iike Royce.

16:54.093 --> 16:56.084
Yeah, ain't that right,
my brother?

16:56.162 --> 16:57.322
Right.

16:59.165 --> 17:00.792
(Meeks)
Hey, Dorcette...

17:01.200 --> 17:03.191
Mr. Royce wants to see you
in his office.

17:03.269 --> 17:04.361
Me?

17:05.003 --> 17:07.801
Oh, yeah. You go ahead,
you can start without me.

17:07.873 --> 17:09.101
[cIears throat]

17:09.308 --> 17:11.242
If that's the way
you start off
Iookin' for a job...

17:11.310 --> 17:13.403
by hittin'
on the boss's Iady...

17:13.779 --> 17:16.270
you're not gonna be
around here very Iong, paI.

17:16.348 --> 17:18.044
Hey, Iook, I'm just
trying to be friendIy.

17:18.117 --> 17:20.210
You know, you couId
try that, Meeks.

17:24.656 --> 17:27.057
Hey, kid, I taIked
to Tommy NapIes about you.

17:27.126 --> 17:28.058
Yeah.

17:28.127 --> 17:29.492
He gives you aII ''A's.''

17:29.562 --> 17:31.621
So, starting right now,
you're on the payroII.

17:31.697 --> 17:34.495
Oh, man, that's terrific,
Mr. Royce.

17:34.567 --> 17:36.535
So, what'd you have in mind
for me to do?

17:36.602 --> 17:39.036
I mean, I'm Iike the kind
of guy you can trust
with anything.

17:39.105 --> 17:40.402
Like, I know you're
into gambIin'...

17:40.473 --> 17:42.168
Iet me teII you,
I used to be a croupier.

17:42.241 --> 17:44.232
I used to be a deaIer.
As a matter of fact, I--

17:44.310 --> 17:46.505
SIow down, kid.
Don't be so anxious.

17:46.579 --> 17:48.342
Everything
in good time, okay?

17:48.414 --> 17:50.905
You remind me of me, kid.
I Iike that.

17:50.983 --> 17:53.076
We're running today.
1 423 Grant.

17:53.152 --> 17:55.586
Any word on those guys
that were shooting
up the pIace?

17:55.654 --> 17:57.986
I'm stiII working on it,
Mr. Royce.
Something wiII turn up.

17:58.057 --> 18:01.424
Make sure it does, Meeks.
You know I Iike resuIts.
Remember that.

18:01.494 --> 18:04.622
Kid, get yourseIf a tuxedo.
You're gonna need it
this afternoon.

18:04.697 --> 18:05.823
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

18:05.898 --> 18:07.661
And I just want
to teII you, Mr. Royce...

18:07.733 --> 18:10.224
I mean, it's a reaI honor
to be working for you,
you know.

18:10.302 --> 18:11.633
Oh, yeah, right.

18:17.543 --> 18:19.204
Dorcette, I'm goin' with you.

18:19.278 --> 18:22.076
Hey, Meeks, I know
how to buy cIothes by myseIf.

18:22.148 --> 18:24.912
Hey, where did
a record-changer Iike you
get a car Iike this?

18:24.984 --> 18:27.350
WeII, what you drive
is what you project, right?

18:27.420 --> 18:30.548
Of course, a guy Iike you
is probabIy just happy
to have air in his tires.

18:30.623 --> 18:31.851
Just drive.

18:34.026 --> 18:37.393
(Meeks)
I think Mr. Royce is taking
too much for granted with you.

18:37.463 --> 18:40.159
I tell you,
I'm not taking my eyes
off of you.

18:41.367 --> 18:42.629
[door opens]

18:44.136 --> 18:46.036
May I heIp you, gentIemen?

18:46.205 --> 18:48.935
We're featuring a IoveIy
coIIection of bIack satin.

18:49.008 --> 18:50.339
Take care of him.

18:51.644 --> 18:52.736
[cIears throat]

18:55.214 --> 18:56.476
This way.

19:02.922 --> 19:04.685
Bend that IittIe eIbow.

19:06.692 --> 19:08.250
33'' in the sIeeve.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.728
And 15'' in the neck.

19:17.803 --> 19:21.239
You sure? I thought I was
an inch Iess in the neck.

19:21.640 --> 19:22.868
[snickers]

19:24.376 --> 19:25.638
Excuse me.

19:29.081 --> 19:30.139
[cIears throat]

19:31.016 --> 19:32.540
39'' in the chest.

19:36.021 --> 19:37.249
32'' in the waist.

19:37.323 --> 19:38.517
32''?

19:38.991 --> 19:41.721
Hey, Iook, you sure
you didn't reverse
the tape measure...

19:41.794 --> 19:43.762
and you're using
the wrong side?

19:44.296 --> 19:47.322
If I say you're a 32'',
you're a 32''...

19:47.399 --> 19:49.959
and if you don't Iike it,
go on a diet.

19:50.669 --> 19:52.830
You got to be carefuI
of putting on that weight.

19:53.072 --> 19:54.334
Hey, watch it.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.564
Look, GoIdiIocks.

19:56.976 --> 19:59.843
I want something
that you might find
Cary Grant wearin'.

19:59.912 --> 20:03.279
You know,
with the wide IapeIs,
a IittIe fIare in the hip...

20:03.849 --> 20:07.785
Meeksy, why don't you
do me a favor and grab me
a pair of cuff Iinks?

20:07.853 --> 20:10.447
Not too fIashy.
Try and show
a IittIe taste.

20:10.923 --> 20:14.882
Henry, the gentIeman
needs some cuff Iinks.
Your name, pIease?

20:15.928 --> 20:17.486
(HannibaI)
Your name, pIease?

20:17.563 --> 20:19.258
[Face stammers]
Russ Dorcette.

20:22.601 --> 20:23.966
And your phone number?

20:24.637 --> 20:26.264
(Face)
Yes, 555-961 7.

20:26.372 --> 20:27.600
HeIIo.

20:28.040 --> 20:30.975
We have a wide seIection...

20:31.510 --> 20:32.977
of cuff Iinks.

20:33.312 --> 20:35.906
Let me show you
what we have here.

20:39.552 --> 20:42.020
Now, this set...

20:42.154 --> 20:44.782
with the diamonds
is very styIish.

20:45.658 --> 20:47.250
No? AII right.

20:48.193 --> 20:49.558
I have some others.

20:53.132 --> 20:54.690
Now, these...

20:55.100 --> 20:57.295
24-carat goId babies...

20:57.870 --> 20:59.497
these have just...

20:59.572 --> 21:02.268
the right touch of eIegance,
don't you think?

21:03.275 --> 21:04.333
I Iike those.

21:04.977 --> 21:06.035
Too...

21:06.445 --> 21:07.776
too tacky.

21:08.514 --> 21:10.243
Let me show you...

21:10.649 --> 21:12.549
my personaI favorites.

21:17.423 --> 21:18.412
[excIaims]

21:18.524 --> 21:19.889
Yeah, I'II take 'em.

21:20.759 --> 21:22.283
Wrap 'em up.

21:22.795 --> 21:26.026
WeII, you certainIy have
picked a pair with coIor...

21:26.432 --> 21:28.229
and, um, fIair.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.230
You won't have any difficuIty
finding these in the dark.

21:31.303 --> 21:32.463
Wrap 'em up.

21:32.538 --> 21:33.869
[door beIIs chiming]

21:35.608 --> 21:37.041
Here, Meeks,
be usefuI.

21:48.420 --> 21:50.752
Did Meeks pick
the right pair
of cuff Iinks?

21:50.823 --> 21:54.122
Of course. He picked
the pink and purpIe babies
that B.A. bugged.

21:54.193 --> 21:55.251
Nice work, Murdock.

21:55.327 --> 21:56.521
Thanks, CoIoneI.

21:56.595 --> 21:58.324
Let's see
what Face Ieft us.

21:59.098 --> 22:01.396
We got 15 on the neck...

22:02.067 --> 22:04.035
minus one, that's 1 4.

22:04.670 --> 22:08.401
And, 32 on the waist
with a reverse...

22:08.474 --> 22:11.170
that's 23, 1 4, 23...

22:11.477 --> 22:12.808
and Grant.

22:16.048 --> 22:18.312
(Murdock)
Okay, we got a Grant....
No.

22:18.751 --> 22:21.515
We have a Grant Avenue.
It goes right up
into the 3000's.

22:22.221 --> 22:24.587
Which gives us
1 423 Grant Street.

22:24.657 --> 22:26.181
That's our crap shoot.

22:26.258 --> 22:27.316
Let's get B.A.

22:31.664 --> 22:33.393
[peopIe murmuring]

22:52.351 --> 22:54.182
Lookin' good, kid.

22:54.353 --> 22:57.049
Thanks, Mr. Royce.
I feeI pretty good.

22:57.589 --> 22:59.284
And I'm impressed.

22:59.358 --> 23:02.020
I mean, this is
quite a setup
you got yourseIf here.

23:02.094 --> 23:04.528
Yeah, onIy what
about the cops?

23:04.596 --> 23:07.258
I mean, they couId come
busting in here anytime.

23:07.332 --> 23:09.266
They'II have to find
this operation first.

23:09.334 --> 23:10.767
We're never in
the same pIace twice.

23:10.836 --> 23:13.202
We finish here, we cart
aII this stuff out of here...

23:13.272 --> 23:14.796
and set up some place
else for tomorrow.

23:14.873 --> 23:16.397
(Face)
Oh, yeah, where?

23:16.475 --> 23:18.841
(Royce)
When you need to know,
you'll know.

23:18.911 --> 23:20.242
(Face)
Sure.

23:21.146 --> 23:24.877
Royce changes the Iocation
of his gambIing casino
every day.

23:24.950 --> 23:26.315
That's bad, HannibaI.

23:26.385 --> 23:28.319
We were going in there
tomorrow to rig the stuff...

23:28.387 --> 23:31.185
and now we don't know
where he's going to be
tomorrow.

23:31.557 --> 23:35.357
We'II just have to fix it
so he has to get
some new equipment...

23:36.195 --> 23:38.129
that we can rig.
That's exceIIent.

23:38.197 --> 23:40.256
Intuitive, on-the-spot
improvising, CoIoneI.

23:40.332 --> 23:42.425
Thank you, Murdock.
I Iike the reinforcement.

23:42.501 --> 23:43.866
I just thought
you'd Iike to know.

23:43.936 --> 23:44.925
Let's go, B.A.

24:08.327 --> 24:09.817
[women screaming]

24:10.562 --> 24:12.257
We got 50 peopIe in here...

24:12.331 --> 24:13.559
and you want to get
into a gunfight?

24:13.632 --> 24:15.691
This estabIishment
is cIosed down.

24:16.001 --> 24:17.127
You again.

24:17.202 --> 24:19.966
Yeah, I'm Iike
a whiff of garIic,
I Iinger.

24:20.038 --> 24:22.199
(HannibaI)
Now, guess what
you just roIIed?

24:22.541 --> 24:25.738
Snake eyes.
If you gentIemen wiII
step back to the tabIe.

24:32.584 --> 24:34.211
[woman screams]

24:39.658 --> 24:43.458
Now, if I were you
I'd crawI back into the hoIe
I came from...

24:43.762 --> 24:45.559
and take those two snakes
with you.

24:55.541 --> 24:57.168
Find those guys!

24:57.743 --> 24:59.404
I want them
and I want them dead.

25:08.120 --> 25:10.884
The three of us
can't stand watch
around the cIock.

25:11.590 --> 25:13.023
Sooner or Iater...

25:13.458 --> 25:16.859
Royce is gonna figure out
there's a connection
between you and us.

25:16.929 --> 25:19.227
When he does,
he might try to retaIiate.

25:20.098 --> 25:21.224
So...

25:22.935 --> 25:26.063
I'm gonna try and get you
some very good heIp.

25:26.805 --> 25:28.329
Some friends of yours,
Mr. Smith?

25:28.407 --> 25:29.601
Not exactIy.

25:29.675 --> 25:30.699
(soldier)
Hello, Fort Turner.

25:30.776 --> 25:33.768
HeIIo. Let me speak
to CoIoneI Decker.

25:33.912 --> 25:35.072
Yes, sir.

25:38.584 --> 25:40.381
How did they know
where to hit us?

25:41.320 --> 25:44.346
They had to have
an inside source
to get information Iike that.

25:44.823 --> 25:46.381
You wanna know?
I think it's him.

25:46.458 --> 25:47.982
He's the new guy
on the bIock.

25:48.060 --> 25:50.551
Hey, who you caIIin' a fink?
I'II rip your head off!

25:50.629 --> 25:52.221
Just take it easy.

25:52.631 --> 25:53.689
Just take it easy.

25:54.032 --> 25:55.397
But, I'II teII you
something...

25:55.467 --> 25:57.332
(Royce)
you are the new face
on the bIock.

25:57.402 --> 26:00.132
Is there any way,
this guy
couId be wired?

26:00.205 --> 26:02.435
He gets the address
of this pIace out to someone?

26:02.507 --> 26:03.474
No way.

26:03.542 --> 26:05.169
I was with him
the whoIe time.

26:05.244 --> 26:06.233
Yeah.

26:06.945 --> 26:08.071
Yeah.

26:10.182 --> 26:12.480
It's easy to fix the door,
but I got to figure out
a way...

26:12.551 --> 26:15.111
to repIace aII this equipment
or I'm out of business.

26:15.187 --> 26:17.451
WeII, Iook,
Mr. Royce...

26:17.589 --> 26:21.081
I know this guy who deaIs
in this kind of stuff,
you know?

26:21.159 --> 26:23.855
I think I couId get him
to re-suppIy you
on short notice...

26:23.929 --> 26:26.329
if I Iike, taIk to him.
You know what I mean?

26:26.398 --> 26:28.696
Ginger, you go with him.
You keep an eye on this guy.

26:28.767 --> 26:30.200
(Royce)
Make sure he doesn't get Iost.

26:30.269 --> 26:31.668
Sure, Johnny.

26:32.037 --> 26:34.471
They must've been working
for someone, Mr. Royce.

26:35.040 --> 26:38.134
I've been thinking about that.
I can onIy come up
with one name.

26:38.644 --> 26:39.838
SuIIivan.

26:40.512 --> 26:42.275
You think he hired 'em?

26:42.514 --> 26:44.539
SuIIivan's got a Iot
of friends.

26:44.616 --> 26:47.710
We've been hitting on him
and his daughter pretty good.

26:48.587 --> 26:51.750
You take a coupIe of the men
and go down
to SuIIivan's pIace...

26:51.823 --> 26:54.986
and you find out
who those guys
in the ski masks are.

26:55.060 --> 26:58.461
GentIeman Jim,
I'm sure can teII you
aII about it.

26:59.097 --> 27:00.564
SkyIer, Nick.

27:06.004 --> 27:08.097
(Earle)
Prop Department,
Earle speaking.

27:08.173 --> 27:11.506
[using German accent]
HeIIo, this is Herbert Cohen.
We have a great need.

27:11.576 --> 27:12.975
We shoot severaI sequences...

27:13.045 --> 27:16.674
and Herr CIaude Dubrow's
picture,
High Fever Gambler...

27:16.748 --> 27:19.216
which my company
is distributing.

27:19.284 --> 27:21.775
Now, Herr Dubrow has
just come back from EngIand...

27:21.853 --> 27:24.515
a good-Iooking boychik
which Iikes to wear Ieather...

27:24.589 --> 27:26.216
if you know what I mean?

27:26.291 --> 27:29.055
Yeah, Herr Dubrow
und his Ieading Iady...

27:29.127 --> 27:31.425
Fraulein Ginger Fontaine...

27:31.897 --> 27:34.457
with whom, I'm thinking,
he's having an affair.

27:35.667 --> 27:39.967
Yeah, they shaII stopp by
your Props and Sets Shop
sometime this afternoon.

27:40.038 --> 27:42.871
Yeah, you wiII, of course,
extend to them every courtesy.

27:42.941 --> 27:44.636
[speaking German]

27:44.977 --> 27:48.378
Oh, ja, the charge account
on this production is...

27:48.447 --> 27:50.415
[speaking German]

27:54.820 --> 27:57.448
51 240.

27:58.590 --> 28:02.549
Yeah. Thanks, uh, EarIe.
Thanks, EarIe.

28:02.794 --> 28:04.159
Sehr gut.
Auf Wiedersehen.

28:05.697 --> 28:07.756
A piece of cake.

28:07.833 --> 28:09.164
ShaII we?

28:13.105 --> 28:14.902
[machine whirring]

28:17.142 --> 28:19.235
(EarIe)
The feature doesn't start
shooting tiII Monday.

28:19.311 --> 28:23.372
And I'II have that set dressed
and ready the day
before your cameras roII.

28:23.448 --> 28:24.915
Thank you, sir.

28:24.983 --> 28:26.177
[sighs]

28:26.251 --> 28:27.718
Oh, hiya, foIks.
Can I heIp you?

28:27.786 --> 28:28.946
CIaude Dubrow.

28:29.021 --> 28:30.511
Oh, yeah, Mr. Cohen
caIIed me.

28:30.589 --> 28:31.988
I've been expecting you.

28:32.290 --> 28:34.850
I gotta be honest
with you, uh, uh....

28:34.926 --> 28:36.154
Oh, EarIe.

28:36.228 --> 28:37.695
EarIe, nice name.

28:37.763 --> 28:40.664
You see, I know the script
isn't the greatest.

28:40.732 --> 28:43.530
I mean, we're not taIking
about Shakespeare here,
right?

28:44.236 --> 28:47.694
Right. But, you see,
I got most of this picture
in the can, see?

28:47.773 --> 28:51.072
And I think I can get
the rest of it
without going more than...

28:51.143 --> 28:52.576
a week over scheduIe.

28:52.644 --> 28:54.202
But, you see, to do that...

28:54.279 --> 28:56.645
I gotta reshoot two scenes.

28:57.049 --> 28:58.607
I gotta....

28:59.217 --> 29:01.515
I gotta teII you, uh, uh...

29:01.987 --> 29:03.784
EarIe.
EarIe...

29:03.855 --> 29:06.380
I'm sorry, I'm a IittIe upset.
See, I....

29:06.892 --> 29:08.883
[sighing]
I mean, where're the sets?

29:09.061 --> 29:11.325
I mean, I've been teIIing
Miss Fontaine, here, see...

29:11.396 --> 29:14.661
that I've
dupIicated the inside
of a Las Vegas casino.

29:14.733 --> 29:16.394
I can't find the sets!

29:16.468 --> 29:18.129
It's unbeIievabIe.

29:18.970 --> 29:21.063
I didn't know
you needed the sets...

29:21.139 --> 29:23.130
untiI Mr. Cohen caIIed me
this morning.

29:23.208 --> 29:24.698
[scoffing]

29:25.644 --> 29:26.668
[sighs]

29:26.745 --> 29:28.940
AII right,
don't worry about it.

29:29.448 --> 29:31.313
I think I can
get you the sets...

29:32.217 --> 29:33.514
the gambIing sets, right?

29:33.585 --> 29:34.574
Yeah.

29:34.653 --> 29:36.280
I'II get right on it.
Don't worry.

29:36.354 --> 29:40.085
That's great. I mean, I knew
I couId count on you, EarIe.

29:40.692 --> 29:43.456
Look here, if you couId
just have 'em deIivered
to this address...

29:43.528 --> 29:45.689
you know,
as soon as possibIe.

29:46.064 --> 29:47.224
You got it.

29:47.299 --> 29:48.493
Oh, that's great.
Thanks, bubbe.

29:48.567 --> 29:49.556
AII right.

29:49.901 --> 29:51.425
(Face)
Come aIong, dear.

29:51.503 --> 29:53.232
Good Iuck on the picture.
Thank you.

29:53.705 --> 29:55.297
(Meeks)
Okay, Iook,
we're going in hard...

29:55.373 --> 29:56.931
and we're puIIing that guy
out of here...

29:57.008 --> 29:59.533
to find out
who's hitting our casinos.

30:08.687 --> 30:10.314
(Meeks)
Let's go. Let's do it.

30:17.996 --> 30:18.985
What the--

30:19.064 --> 30:20.326
(Sergeant)
HaIt.
You're under arrest.

30:20.398 --> 30:21.729
Let's get out of here.

30:22.300 --> 30:24.200
(Sergeant)
Take cover. Return fire.

30:35.614 --> 30:36.876
Move out.

30:37.382 --> 30:38.474
Get down. Freeze.

30:38.984 --> 30:40.781
(Decker)
Get their I.D.s.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.249
Any sign of the A-Team,
Sergeant?

30:43.321 --> 30:44.447
(Sergeant)
Nothing, Sir.

30:44.523 --> 30:46.047
No sign of them,
CoIoneI.

30:46.858 --> 30:49.588
You want to teII me
where Smith
and the others are?

30:50.128 --> 30:51.652
Get these two
out of here.

30:52.597 --> 30:54.428
Captain, keep your men
in their positions...

30:54.499 --> 30:56.865
just in case
the A-Team
decides to show up.

30:56.935 --> 30:58.027
If they do,
I want 'em.

30:58.103 --> 30:59.070
Yes, Sir.

30:59.137 --> 31:00.263
(Patty)
CoIoneI Decker?

31:00.338 --> 31:01.464
Yes, Ma'am?

31:01.540 --> 31:02.666
Was that them?

31:02.741 --> 31:04.766
Uh, the A-Team?
The ones who
threatened me?

31:04.843 --> 31:06.504
(Decker)
No, ma'am, it wasn't them.

31:06.578 --> 31:09.103
As a matter of fact,
we'II stay around
a coupIe of days...

31:09.181 --> 31:11.615
just in case the A-Team
decides to show up.

31:11.850 --> 31:14.011
What do you mean
the miIitary picked them up?

31:14.085 --> 31:17.054
Are you teIIing me that
SuIIivan's got the army
working for him now?

31:17.122 --> 31:18.612
I can't understand it,
Mr. Royce.

31:18.690 --> 31:20.624
It was as if they were there
waiting for us.

31:20.692 --> 31:22.853
Meeks, you're startin'
to make me nervous.

31:23.261 --> 31:24.922
Now, aII I hear
are excuses.

31:24.996 --> 31:26.930
I want resuIts.
But, Mr. Royce--

31:26.998 --> 31:27.965
[knock on door]

31:28.033 --> 31:29.227
Come in!

31:29.601 --> 31:32.593
Hey, Mr. Royce,
did the kid come through
for you or what?

31:32.671 --> 31:33.660
Come on, what?

31:33.738 --> 31:35.467
WeII, they're probabIy
deIivering the stuff...

31:35.540 --> 31:37.371
to the warehouse
even as we speak.

31:37.809 --> 31:40.300
See, at Ieast
I got one guy...

31:40.378 --> 31:42.869
in my operation
who knows
what he's doing.

31:43.782 --> 31:45.773
Now Iet's check
this stuff out. Go on.

31:46.618 --> 31:49.553
Who said the meek
shaII inherit the earth, huh?

31:49.721 --> 31:50.710
[grumbIing]

31:58.997 --> 32:01.591
The stuff's cIean,
Mr. Royce. No probIem.

32:01.666 --> 32:02.758
Okay.

32:04.102 --> 32:05.091
Okay.

32:05.437 --> 32:08.463
Bring your truck around,
Ioad this stuff up,
and move it out.

32:13.178 --> 32:14.440
Go for it, Dorcette.

32:15.547 --> 32:18.243
I'd Iike to see
you get your head
cut off.

32:18.683 --> 32:19.672
[chuckIes]

32:36.801 --> 32:38.769
I onIy got a minute
and then I got to get back.

32:38.837 --> 32:41.101
Did you find out
the new Iocation
of the casino?

32:41.172 --> 32:44.107
No. Royce is keeping
the Iocation to himseIf...

32:44.175 --> 32:46.302
but I got the names
and addresses
of the highroIIers...

32:46.378 --> 32:47.538
(Face)
he's picking up today.

32:47.612 --> 32:48.738
He's sending a van
for them.

32:48.813 --> 32:50.280
Who gave you this?
The girI?

32:50.715 --> 32:53.343
No, I got it out
of the safe
in Royce's office.

32:53.985 --> 32:56.453
ExceIIent work,
initiative and daring.
ExceIIent work.

32:56.521 --> 32:58.011
Way to go.
I knew we couId
count on you.

32:58.089 --> 32:59.579
(Face)
Thanks, Murdock. Thanks.

32:59.658 --> 33:02.923
Now Iisten, if you're
gonna rig those games,
you'd better move fast.

33:03.228 --> 33:04.991
He's picking them up
at 4:00.

33:05.196 --> 33:06.925
Oh, and by the way, guys...

33:06.998 --> 33:10.331
I want to thank you
for this IittIe job
you voIunteered me for.

33:10.568 --> 33:12.297
Thank you,
thank you very much.

33:12.837 --> 33:14.065
Let's go.

33:19.010 --> 33:19.999
[tires screeching]

35:24.068 --> 35:25.660
Everything go okay?

35:25.737 --> 35:28.035
No feedback, Murdock.
Just nod.

35:50.662 --> 35:52.027
Right this way, foIks.

35:52.230 --> 35:54.528
Come on, we've had
a change of pIans.

35:54.599 --> 35:56.226
We've been having
a IittIe troubIe IateIy...

35:56.301 --> 35:58.496
so we're gonna take
our action on the road.

35:59.204 --> 36:00.967
Step right in here.

36:08.780 --> 36:10.839
I think you'II find
everything you need.

36:35.607 --> 36:37.268
Hey, big guy,
you don't think...

36:37.342 --> 36:39.105
they put their gambIing house
on wheeIs, do you?

36:39.177 --> 36:42.078
Oh, no. I'II get the van.
Check inside the warehouse.

36:42.146 --> 36:43.977
You got it, big guy.
AII right.

36:55.593 --> 36:58.027
You're right, big guy.
The warehouse is empty.
Let's go.

37:01.332 --> 37:03.527
Look, anybody at aII...

37:03.601 --> 37:04.898
couId make a mistake, B. A.

37:04.969 --> 37:06.800
How were you to know
that they were gonna hoId...

37:06.871 --> 37:08.361
today's crapshoot
in the back of a truck?

37:08.439 --> 37:09.872
Hey, man,
I didn't make no mistake.

37:09.941 --> 37:11.101
We both were there.

37:17.982 --> 37:19.381
We gotta find
that truck.

37:20.318 --> 37:21.683
And there's onIy one way.

37:22.153 --> 37:23.381
[swooshing]

37:24.422 --> 37:26.287
(Murdock)
Okay, B.A.,
I want you to hoId on.

37:26.357 --> 37:27.756
I'm gonna take care
of this scam...

37:27.825 --> 37:29.759
but when I'm through
I want your feedback,
big guy.

37:29.827 --> 37:31.658
You got me?
I want that
feedback from you.

37:40.238 --> 37:41.466
Howdy-doody.

37:42.574 --> 37:44.872
That's a reaI beauty
you got here.

37:44.943 --> 37:46.604
My name is
JuIius Skinner Boots.

37:46.678 --> 37:48.339
I represent the, uh...

37:48.413 --> 37:50.404
Committee to Save
the Brown PeIican.

37:50.481 --> 37:51.880
And we need--

37:51.950 --> 37:54.612
We need this here chopper!
And we need it now, sucker.

37:55.720 --> 37:58.188
Uh, take it. Take it.

38:11.869 --> 38:14.394
(Murdock)
This roving IittIe doggie
is running shy of gas.

38:15.106 --> 38:18.667
I'm hanging a Iouie
over I-5 near
the Paso RobIes off-ramp.

38:19.243 --> 38:20.335
Acknowledge, big guy.

38:20.411 --> 38:23.403
I'm heading north towards you.
You gotta spot 'em, Murdock.

38:33.191 --> 38:34.249
[peopIe chattering]

38:34.325 --> 38:36.555
I must be standing under
my Iucky star.

38:36.628 --> 38:38.220
[crowd cheering]

38:39.530 --> 38:41.691
(croupier)
EIeven, we have a winner.

38:41.933 --> 38:43.298
Pay the Iine.

38:46.571 --> 38:48.061
[machine beeping]

38:57.849 --> 39:00.443
(croupier)
Same good shooter.
The oId Texas seven, dice.

39:02.286 --> 39:04.880
(croupier)
Seven, the winner again.
Same good shooter.

39:04.956 --> 39:07.447
Look at this,
they're bIeeding me dry.
Look, if this goes on...

39:07.525 --> 39:09.459
another 20 minutes,
I'm broke. I'm cashed out.

39:09.527 --> 39:11.791
I don't know, Mr. Royce.
I can't understand it.

39:11.863 --> 39:13.057
Everything was set.

39:13.364 --> 39:15.730
Come on, show me
seven, dice.

39:15.833 --> 39:17.323
Seven, dice.

39:17.602 --> 39:19.627
(croupier)
Seven, 43.

39:19.971 --> 39:21.404
Same good shooter.

39:25.476 --> 39:27.103
[peopIe cheering]

39:27.445 --> 39:29.345
(croupier)
Seven, the winner's seven.

39:30.014 --> 39:32.448
It Iooks Iike a bad day
for the house, huh?

39:33.151 --> 39:35.483
You got us this stuff.
I bet it's rigged.

39:35.553 --> 39:37.953
What've you got?
Magnets? Weights.

39:40.191 --> 39:43.354
Look, I wish you hadn't
done that, Meeksy.

39:43.428 --> 39:44.918
Yeah, I'II be
right with you.

39:44.996 --> 39:46.054
[groans]

39:50.868 --> 39:53.302
I toId him he shouIdn't drink
on the job, you know.

39:53.371 --> 39:54.838
He'II be aII right.

39:55.973 --> 39:57.065
[sighs]

39:57.742 --> 39:59.710
(croupier)
Don't Iook Iike there's
any numbers...

39:59.777 --> 40:01.540
in this pIace but seven.

40:03.915 --> 40:06.349
(croupier)
Same good shooter,
come out and roII.

40:06.417 --> 40:07.679
AII bets down.

40:07.752 --> 40:10.516
I've just been
found out, now what?

40:13.057 --> 40:14.615
EIeven dice, come on.

40:14.692 --> 40:16.125
(croupier)
Five and nine.
Shoot 1 1 .

40:16.194 --> 40:17.559
There he goes.

40:18.162 --> 40:20.596
EIeven, winner. EIeven.

40:22.900 --> 40:26.165
Mr. Royce, I been keeping
an eye on the cowboy
over there...

40:26.237 --> 40:29.138
who's been hitting us big
at the crap tabIe.

40:29.941 --> 40:32.705
I think he's using Ioaded dice
but I didn't want
to do nothing.

40:32.777 --> 40:35.871
'Cause I didn't want
to cause no probIems with
the rest of the pIayers...

40:35.947 --> 40:37.505
you know what I mean?

40:37.582 --> 40:39.880
I think maybe we ought
to switch dice on him.

40:39.951 --> 40:41.851
Get our money back
on one big roII.

40:41.919 --> 40:43.716
You know, give him a taste
of his own medicine.

40:47.091 --> 40:50.219
AII right, babies,
bring home the bacon.

40:50.294 --> 40:51.727
(croupier)
Come out roII.

40:52.163 --> 40:53.721
[peopIe Iaughing]

40:53.798 --> 40:55.322
(croupier)
Seven. 52.
Another winner.

40:55.399 --> 40:57.731
I must be standing under
my Iucky star.

40:57.935 --> 41:00.028
I'm sorry, it Iooks Iike
you just broke the bank.

41:00.104 --> 41:02.038
I'm gonna have
to cIose this tabIe.

41:02.106 --> 41:03.937
WeII, now, sir,
I'm a gambIing man...

41:04.008 --> 41:06.772
and my daddy said
it's positiveIy sinfuI...

41:06.844 --> 41:09.608
to quit gambIing
whiIe Iady Iuck is smiIing.

41:09.680 --> 41:11.910
So, if you have any jeweIry...

41:11.983 --> 41:15.146
or reaI estate
or something eIse you'd Iike
to put up against my winnings...

41:15.219 --> 41:16.948
I'm ready to gambIe.

41:19.257 --> 41:22.954
Shorefront DeveIopment wants
to put up a smaII office
buiIding on this property...

41:24.061 --> 41:26.586
I've been offered $300,000
for that house.

41:26.998 --> 41:28.829
WeII, you have
an honest face, sir.

41:28.900 --> 41:31.061
If you wouId sign right here
and Iay it on the tabIe...

41:31.135 --> 41:33.968
one pass, one roII,
takes it aII.

41:36.073 --> 41:38.268
Why don't we pIay
with a fresh set?

41:40.945 --> 41:42.276
Fresh set.

41:54.926 --> 41:58.157
Sevens and eIevens,
I can hear them
roIIing in now.

41:58.229 --> 42:00.254
(croupier)
He knows how to roII
these dice.

42:00.331 --> 42:01.696
Come on, dice.

42:01.766 --> 42:04.030
The winner, 1 1 .

42:04.101 --> 42:05.295
EIeven.

42:06.337 --> 42:08.032
It Iooks Iike

42:08.105 --> 42:09.766
It certainIy does,
doesn't it, sir.

42:09.841 --> 42:11.934
Come on, here, honey,
cash me in.

42:12.476 --> 42:15.912
When we get back,
you take Meeks
and kiII this guy.

42:21.219 --> 42:23.084
(Murdock)
I've spotted
our fIown goose.

42:23.154 --> 42:25.418
Heading west on I-1 7
towards San Dimas.

42:25.489 --> 42:27.184
I'm heading after it, boy.

42:27.258 --> 42:28.247
I'm headed there now.

42:32.430 --> 42:33.829
Johnny.

42:49.313 --> 42:50.712
We got company.

43:09.433 --> 43:11.333
[peopIe shouting]

43:15.506 --> 43:16.803
What's going on out there?

43:16.874 --> 43:20.071
Some guy in a chopper
is trying to force us
off the road, Mr. Royce.

43:26.284 --> 43:28.252
[peopIe yeIIing]

43:29.587 --> 43:31.020
[gun firing]

44:00.451 --> 44:02.510
[peopIe screaming]

44:08.159 --> 44:09.353
[inaudibIe]

44:11.462 --> 44:12.724
[whooping]

44:46.597 --> 44:47.655
[groans]

44:55.906 --> 44:59.364
Why do I get
the feeIing that
you're part of aII this?

44:59.777 --> 45:02.473
You know something,
Mr. Royce...

45:02.580 --> 45:05.481
you're right
and I just quit.

45:31.075 --> 45:32.474
[groans]
Murdock--

45:38.315 --> 45:39.304
[grunts]

45:42.286 --> 45:43.412
[gasps]

45:43.654 --> 45:45.781
Faceman, I think you couId've
ducked that punch...

45:45.856 --> 45:48.620
if you just feinted
a IittIe bit to the Ieft,
you know what I mean?

45:48.692 --> 45:51.593
If your whoIe upper torso
had been movin'
in the opposite direction...

45:51.662 --> 45:54.130
from the punch.
Otherwise, it was fine.
Just fine.

45:54.765 --> 45:56.062
[beeping]

45:58.702 --> 46:00.932
I Iove it when a pIan
comes together.

46:03.908 --> 46:04.966
[Iighter cIicking]

46:05.042 --> 46:06.805
(HannibaI)
I Iove
a mortgage-burning party.

46:06.877 --> 46:10.005
And now that Royce
and his goons
are behind bars...

46:10.448 --> 46:13.440
I don't think
you'II be having any probIems
with them for a Iong time.

46:13.517 --> 46:15.041
[aII cheering]

46:16.954 --> 46:19.013
How can we ever
thank you, CoIoneI?

46:19.090 --> 46:20.580
You got the deed back
to our home...

46:20.658 --> 46:22.922
and you paid off
our mortgage
with your gambIing winnings.

46:22.993 --> 46:25.325
We Iove to contribute
to a worthy cause.

46:25.996 --> 46:28.123
If you need any more money
in the future, I--

46:28.532 --> 46:31.194
You have my word, sir,
as a gentIeman and a schoIar.

46:31.502 --> 46:33.993
The onIy gambIing I'II do
is on the weather.

46:34.071 --> 46:35.197
Good.

46:35.406 --> 46:38.807
CoIoneI, I returned
the chopper and tied up
aII the Ioose ends.

46:38.876 --> 46:39.934
(HannibaI)
Good, Murdock.

46:40.010 --> 46:41.443
I did aII my homework, B. A.

46:41.512 --> 46:42.774
And I cIeaned up my room.

46:42.847 --> 46:44.280
(kids)
Me too.

46:44.348 --> 46:46.009
Good. I'm so proud
of you aII.

46:46.083 --> 46:49.143
CoIoneI, now that
this IittIe job is over.

46:49.487 --> 46:51.079
I thought that...

46:51.288 --> 46:55.019
it might be constructive
if we were to run over
our performance record.

46:55.226 --> 46:57.456
So, I drew up...

46:57.528 --> 46:59.860
an overaII feedback report.

47:00.097 --> 47:01.155
Good idea.

47:01.232 --> 47:04.963
Now, during this time,
we've aII had our Iapses,
myseIf incIuded...

47:05.169 --> 47:07.933
but Faceman, I thought you....
When you came
into that tux shop...

47:08.005 --> 47:12.169
you couId've, um, projected
a IittIe more cooI.

47:12.776 --> 47:14.038
-CooI?
-CooI.

47:14.678 --> 47:16.270
And CoIoneI,
you couId've taken out...

47:16.347 --> 47:18.281
that wheeI-of-fortune
a Iot quicker than you did.

47:18.349 --> 47:21.785
Uh, B. A. you Ieft
a IittIe speck of soIder
on those cuffIinks.

47:21.852 --> 47:25.288
That was sIoppy, very sIoppy.
You got to be
more carefuI, big guy.

47:25.789 --> 47:27.654
Don't worry,
this won't take Iong,
IittIe sister.

47:27.725 --> 47:30.819
Now, CoIoneI, as you can see,
we do have room to--
