WEBVTT

00:07.638 --> 00:08.758
Maybe we should go back?

00:09.417 --> 00:11.417
That spot I told you about
is just a little further.

00:11.617 --> 00:12.817
You said that an hour ago.

00:21.170 --> 00:23.405
Ok, so, here's
where we are now.

00:23.472 --> 00:25.073
I think we passed that.

00:25.141 --> 00:27.142
Well, this is where
we stopped for Sammy.

00:28.477 --> 00:30.812
Wait, where is Sammy?

00:30.863 --> 00:33.115
Sammy.

00:33.182 --> 00:35.584
Sammy, quit fooling around.

00:35.651 --> 00:37.586
Sammy, where are you?!

00:37.653 --> 00:39.287
Boo! Ha!

00:39.355 --> 00:40.956
- Don't ever do that!
- That's not funny!

00:41.023 --> 00:42.257
All right.

00:42.325 --> 00:43.258
Sorry.

00:44.326 --> 00:45.660
Did you hear that?

00:45.728 --> 00:47.062
It's not me.

01:08.901 --> 01:10.085
No, no, no.

01:18.861 --> 01:21.213
Stay here.

01:28.704 --> 01:31.106
What is it, dad?

01:44.320 --> 01:46.188
10-year-old Daniel Lanham

01:46.239 --> 01:48.423
was reported missing
while on a camping trip

01:48.491 --> 01:50.158
with his father
last November.

01:50.226 --> 01:52.527
His remains were just discovered
by hikers in Pennsylvania.

01:52.595 --> 01:54.329
That's really close to
the Appalachian Trail.

01:54.396 --> 01:57.249
The Rangers are the ones
calling us in.

01:57.333 --> 02:00.535
The trail covers 14 states and
is nearly 2,200 miles long.

02:00.603 --> 02:01.903
It's a miracle
he was ever found.

02:01.971 --> 02:03.538
I don't think
he was supposed to be.

02:03.606 --> 02:05.874
The unsub could have
left him for the elements,

02:05.942 --> 02:07.742
but he wrapped him
in plastic.

02:07.793 --> 02:10.011
Remorse?
Think he bonded with the kid?

02:10.079 --> 02:12.047
If he's an opportunistic
offender, probably not.

02:12.098 --> 02:14.349
What are the chances that
Daniel was his only victim?

02:14.417 --> 02:15.417
Not good.

02:15.484 --> 02:17.819
Garcia, will you
let the Rangers know

02:17.887 --> 02:19.387
-That we'll be there within the hour?
- Yes, sir.

02:25.628 --> 02:29.147
We're gonna need some more
wood, the drier the better.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.900
- Whatever you can carry.
- How much?

02:31.951 --> 02:33.235
I can help.

02:33.286 --> 02:35.403
Great. You can get
the twigs.

02:35.471 --> 02:37.505
I can carry logs.

02:37.573 --> 02:38.873
Yeah? You and what army?

02:38.941 --> 02:40.675
I don't need one.

02:43.779 --> 02:44.796
Keep an eye on her.

02:48.450 --> 02:49.584
Hey, wait up, Ana.

02:49.652 --> 02:51.253
I've got that stick.

02:51.320 --> 02:54.055
Hey, come, come.

02:55.057 --> 02:57.392
Hey, hold on, wait for me.

02:58.828 --> 03:01.479
Here's one.

03:25.087 --> 03:28.006
Ana! Ana, let's go!

03:28.090 --> 03:29.541
Ok.

04:15.656 --> 04:19.505
Ralph Ellison said,
"I am invisible, understand,

04:19.606 --> 04:22.046
simply because
people refuse to see me."

04:22.171 --> 04:23.505
Guys, I started
a geographic profile

04:23.573 --> 04:25.007
on the assumption
that the Appalachian Trail

04:25.074 --> 04:26.675
is this unsub's hunting ground.

04:26.743 --> 04:28.143
We got lucky with Daniel.

04:28.211 --> 04:30.012
I doubt we'll find
any more bodies.

04:30.079 --> 04:31.814
Parents think
their kids are lost,

04:31.881 --> 04:33.782
but what's worse,
he has them.

04:33.850 --> 04:35.651
Hiding out in the middle
of nowhere.

04:35.718 --> 04:37.219
The Pennsylvania police considered
Daniel's father a suspect.

04:37.287 --> 04:39.455
They interviewed him
several times.

04:39.522 --> 04:41.590
Without a body,
they can't charge him.

04:41.658 --> 04:43.959
Well, he appeared to be obsessed
with finding his son.

04:44.027 --> 04:46.161
He even went back into
the woods dozens of times

04:46.229 --> 04:47.663
following Daniel's
disappearance.

04:47.730 --> 04:49.298
He claimed
he was searching for him.

04:49.365 --> 04:51.133
All right, we'll start
with Daniel's life.

04:51.201 --> 04:53.034
He's been exposed
to a large suspect pool.

04:53.086 --> 04:55.304
Community, school,
family friends--

04:55.371 --> 04:57.756
we can't rule anybody out.

04:58.875 --> 05:01.610
Ranger Turner.
Agent Hotchner?

05:01.678 --> 05:03.712
This is Agent Rossi,
Dr. Reid.

05:03.763 --> 05:05.347
Um, got out some of the maps

05:05.415 --> 05:07.015
that we use
for search and rescue.

05:07.083 --> 05:08.851
Just let me know
what else you might need.

05:08.918 --> 05:09.935
Do you have the M.E.
report on Daniel?

05:10.019 --> 05:12.521
Yeah. It got here
just before you did.

05:12.572 --> 05:13.789
Is Mr. Lanham here?

05:13.857 --> 05:15.357
He's in my office.

05:15.425 --> 05:18.727
We've had him in
a half a dozen times.

05:18.778 --> 05:20.796
Look what happened
in March.

05:30.072 --> 05:32.841
Mr. Lanham, I'm Agent Hotchner
with the FBI.

05:32.909 --> 05:34.176
Hello.

05:34.243 --> 05:37.346
I need to ask you
some questions.

05:37.413 --> 05:39.681
Mr. Lanham, you went back
to the same spot

05:39.749 --> 05:41.283
where Daniel went missing

05:41.351 --> 05:43.819
every weekend from November
until mid-March.

05:43.887 --> 05:45.354
That's right.

05:45.421 --> 05:47.990
And then you stopped going.

05:48.057 --> 05:49.625
Why? What changed?

05:51.761 --> 05:55.531
Mr. Lanham, Daniel died
sometime in mid-March.

05:55.598 --> 05:59.001
You need to explain
why you stopped looking for him

05:59.068 --> 06:01.770
at the same time
that he died.

06:01.838 --> 06:04.206
I don't know.
I just...

06:05.308 --> 06:09.511
I just had this feeling
that he was gone.

06:13.383 --> 06:17.219
You and Daniel went camping
regularly in the woods?

06:17.287 --> 06:19.054
Yeah.

06:19.122 --> 06:20.722
His mother
had full custody

06:20.790 --> 06:23.392
and we only had
the weekends.

06:23.459 --> 06:27.195
I wanted to make them
special,

06:27.263 --> 06:29.865
something
he'd always remember.

06:29.933 --> 06:31.633
Daniel may have been

06:31.684 --> 06:33.902
his only human contact
for months.

06:33.970 --> 06:35.771
You think he's
done this before?

06:35.838 --> 06:37.105
It's difficult to say.

06:37.173 --> 06:40.909
Most child offenders dispose
of their victims immediately.

06:40.977 --> 06:42.911
They become overwhelmed
with reality

06:42.979 --> 06:45.247
and sometimes shame,
until the urge builds up again.

06:45.315 --> 06:46.782
This guy's moved past that,
though.

06:46.849 --> 06:49.318
He feels no remorse
about his compulsions.

06:49.385 --> 06:51.153
He's most likely
had other victims.

06:51.220 --> 06:53.755
If he's a preferential
offender, they'd be about

06:53.823 --> 06:55.457
the same age as Daniel.

06:55.525 --> 06:57.960
Garcia, look for
prepubescent boys

06:58.027 --> 06:59.895
who went missing from
the Appalachian Trail

06:59.963 --> 07:01.229
in the last year.

07:01.297 --> 07:02.764
Better make that
5 years.

07:02.832 --> 07:04.533
This guy's had
a lot of practice.

07:07.036 --> 07:08.303
It wouldn't have taken long

07:08.354 --> 07:10.839
for the elements
to destroy the body.

07:10.890 --> 07:13.475
He wanted Daniel preserved.

07:13.543 --> 07:14.810
Maybe it isn't
a disposal site,

07:14.877 --> 07:16.311
maybe it's a grave.

07:16.362 --> 07:18.513
Then he'd have to leave
a marker.

07:18.581 --> 07:21.116
And he wouldn't want
other hikers to notice it.

07:21.183 --> 07:23.785
Well, he doesn't consider
himself a visitor in the woods.

07:23.853 --> 07:25.520
He feels at home here
like he owns it.

07:25.588 --> 07:28.190
And he'd want to show
his dominance.

07:28.257 --> 07:30.192
You know,
animals make their mark

07:30.259 --> 07:34.229
as high up in a tree
as they can possibly reach.

07:37.717 --> 07:41.536
He probably used an ax.

07:45.942 --> 07:47.876
Prentiss.

07:57.353 --> 08:00.188
He's got another body buried
around here somewhere.

08:06.896 --> 08:09.831
So the night
he disappeared...

08:09.899 --> 08:11.400
You set up camp,

08:11.467 --> 08:13.168
then fell asleep?

08:15.872 --> 08:16.972
Yeah.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.640
And then a man
came in your tent?

08:18.708 --> 08:21.376
No. No one
came in the tent.

08:21.427 --> 08:24.429
Daniel, he--he got up
and he went out.

08:26.883 --> 08:28.917
You ok?

08:28.968 --> 08:31.770
Yeah. Just bathroom.
Be right back.

08:34.490 --> 08:36.058
I should have followed him.

08:36.125 --> 08:39.061
But I didn't.

08:39.128 --> 08:41.163
I fell back asleep.

08:46.035 --> 08:47.969
You and the cops
and everybody,

08:48.037 --> 08:50.072
you think that I did it.

08:51.808 --> 08:53.341
It doesn't matter.

08:53.409 --> 08:55.811
Not to me.

08:58.181 --> 09:01.283
The only thing
that I care about

09:01.350 --> 09:05.187
is what my little boy
was thinking...

09:05.254 --> 09:08.657
That I wasn't there
to protect him.

09:08.725 --> 09:12.694
I was his hero
and I failed.

09:14.831 --> 09:16.498
How do I live with that?

09:26.692 --> 09:28.910
You think
he's telling the truth?

09:28.978 --> 09:30.445
Yeah, I do.

09:30.513 --> 09:31.980
We found another body

09:32.031 --> 09:34.316
at the disposal site,
wrapped in plastic,

09:34.383 --> 09:35.584
roughly Daniel's age.

09:35.651 --> 09:36.952
His clothing matches

09:37.019 --> 09:38.487
a missing persons
report.

09:38.554 --> 09:40.155
Boy's name
is Tyler Stolts,

09:40.223 --> 09:41.790
and he was abducted
23 months ago.

09:41.841 --> 09:43.458
When did Lanham
move to the area?

09:43.526 --> 09:45.293
Summer of '09.

09:45.361 --> 09:46.495
Then we can clear him
as a suspect.

09:46.562 --> 09:48.530
Tyler went missing
in October of 2008,

09:48.598 --> 09:49.998
Daniel the following
November.

09:50.066 --> 09:52.667
So he takes a kid
off the trail in the fall

09:52.735 --> 09:54.336
and keeps him all winter.

09:54.403 --> 09:56.037
It's like he's
hibernating with him.

10:10.119 --> 10:11.620
What?

10:11.687 --> 10:12.988
I need to go pee.

10:13.055 --> 10:14.489
Go get mom.

10:14.557 --> 10:16.725
Please, I really have to go.

10:16.793 --> 10:19.227
Fine. Make it quick.

10:33.209 --> 10:34.476
Go behind there.

10:34.544 --> 10:36.044
Ok.

10:41.884 --> 10:43.885
I can't do it here.

10:43.953 --> 10:45.237
All right. Come on.

10:52.228 --> 10:54.196
I don't want you listening.

10:54.263 --> 10:55.831
Then go back there.

10:55.898 --> 10:57.299
Ok.

11:08.010 --> 11:11.079
Ana, hurry up,
it's freezing.

11:17.920 --> 11:18.954
Ana.

11:25.461 --> 11:27.863
He said he'd kill
mom and dad.

11:27.930 --> 11:29.981
Who?

11:30.066 --> 11:31.600
Me.

11:36.605 --> 11:38.106
What'd you find, Reid?

11:38.157 --> 11:40.575
I went back 10 years, matching
reports of missing children

11:40.643 --> 11:41.977
with Daniel and Tyler's
victimology,

11:42.044 --> 11:45.113
and in my estimation, this unsub
may have taken 12 victims.

11:45.181 --> 11:48.049
How can you attribute all of
those to the same offender?

11:48.117 --> 11:49.451
The dates and locations
of the abductions

11:49.518 --> 11:50.719
create an unmistakable pattern.

11:50.786 --> 11:53.622
Then if he's been abducting
children for 10 years,

11:53.689 --> 11:55.023
why weren't we called
in before now?

11:55.091 --> 11:57.726
The thing is, he walks the
entire trail, end to end,

11:57.793 --> 12:00.061
and each way takes
approximately 6 months.

12:00.129 --> 12:03.732
His sixth victim was taken from
Dawsonville, Georgia, in 2006,

12:03.799 --> 12:06.034
then he walked all the way
to Manchester, Vermont,

12:06.102 --> 12:08.370
and he took a seventh
victim in 2007.

12:08.437 --> 12:10.472
He wasn't down South
again until 2009.

12:10.539 --> 12:12.908
When James Clutter's parents woke up
from a night of camping, he was gone.

12:12.975 --> 12:14.342
They just assumed
he wandered off.

12:14.410 --> 12:16.778
We didn't get called in
because nobody knew he existed.

12:16.846 --> 12:19.347
The crimes are years apart
and across state lines.

12:19.415 --> 12:22.150
The interesting thing is, 10 years
ago he was a more aggressive hunter,

12:22.218 --> 12:24.753
likely on the move hunting and
killing all 365 days a year,

12:24.820 --> 12:26.788
but 2 years ago
he stopped traveling so far.

12:26.856 --> 12:27.889
He's slowing down.

12:27.957 --> 12:29.591
I think something's
affected his mobility.

12:29.659 --> 12:32.193
Old age or an injury from
years of living on the trail.

12:32.261 --> 12:34.713
But the odd thing is,
for the past 2 winters,

12:34.797 --> 12:36.398
he's returned
to this 30-mile radius.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.867
He takes a victim
with him in the fall

12:38.935 --> 12:41.603
to stay with him until spring
somewhere within that area.

12:41.671 --> 12:43.004
These are harsh winters.

12:43.072 --> 12:44.539
He needs to find shelter.

12:44.607 --> 12:46.308
And it would have to be
heavy camouflaged.

12:46.375 --> 12:48.710
Even the most experienced
hikers haven't seen it.

13:13.369 --> 13:15.537
Our parents will be
looking for us.

13:15.604 --> 13:16.738
They'll know we're gone.

13:16.806 --> 13:19.307
We want our mom and dad!

13:22.111 --> 13:24.913
If you let us go,
we won't tell.

13:24.981 --> 13:26.915
Promise. We won't.

13:26.983 --> 13:29.184
Right, Ana?

13:29.251 --> 13:30.719
Yeah.

13:34.223 --> 13:36.091
You can't just leave us
here in the dark.

13:36.158 --> 13:37.425
Robert!

13:42.027 --> 13:43.227
We'll be okay.

13:55.370 --> 13:56.620
What do we have?

13:56.688 --> 13:58.306
Unsub took two kids
this time,

13:58.308 --> 14:00.976
10-year-old Robert Brooks
and his 8-year-old sister Ana.

14:01.594 --> 14:02.609
Girls aren't his preference.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.966
Not a lot of families
camping out in November.

14:05.174 --> 14:06.315
He took what he could get.

14:06.415 --> 14:08.317
And Robert wasn't alone.
He couldn't risk leaving a witness.

14:08.384 --> 14:11.086
The question is,
how long will he keep her alive?

14:20.963 --> 14:23.699
Robert, I'm scared.

14:23.766 --> 14:25.834
What does he want?

14:25.902 --> 14:28.170
I don't know.

14:28.237 --> 14:30.505
What is he gonna do to us?

14:30.573 --> 14:32.474
I don't know.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.976
Just stop, please.
Do you think he's gonna--

14:42.916 --> 14:44.810
mom and dad know
we're gone by now.

14:44.910 --> 14:47.345
So they're gonna send
everybody to find us.

14:47.413 --> 14:49.848
But what if no one
ever finds us?

14:49.915 --> 14:51.049
Don't say that.

14:51.117 --> 14:52.317
We're gonna be ok.

14:52.385 --> 14:54.119
Come on, come on. Shh.

14:54.186 --> 14:57.489
Shh...

14:57.556 --> 14:59.190
It's gonna be fine.

15:06.899 --> 15:07.932
Here.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.536
He kind of looks like
Mr. Binky.

15:16.575 --> 15:18.510
Robert...

15:18.577 --> 15:20.678
Whose toys are these?

15:33.259 --> 15:35.126
The kids wanted
their own tent.

15:35.194 --> 15:36.961
They're too big
to fit with us.

15:37.029 --> 15:38.797
We could hear them giggling.

15:38.864 --> 15:41.199
I fell asleep to it.

15:41.267 --> 15:44.469
Would it be possible for us to get a
piece of each of the children's clothing

15:44.537 --> 15:46.137
to help in the search?

15:46.205 --> 15:47.405
- Thank you.
- Sure.

15:57.850 --> 15:59.617
I want to go with them.

16:03.239 --> 16:04.722
Mr. Brooks, I need you
to stay in the camp

16:04.790 --> 16:06.925
in case Robert and Ana
come back.

16:06.992 --> 16:08.159
Excuse me.

16:08.227 --> 16:09.694
Thank you.

16:09.745 --> 16:12.197
Mr. Lanham,
can I help you?

16:12.248 --> 16:14.699
I heard the news.
I know this area as well as anyone.

16:14.767 --> 16:17.168
Sir, I can't have you
on the trail.

16:17.236 --> 16:19.170
I'm not out here
for vengeance.

16:19.238 --> 16:21.840
What those kids are going through, it's
the same thing Daniel went through.

16:21.907 --> 16:23.007
I understand.

16:23.075 --> 16:25.443
I need to be here.

16:25.511 --> 16:27.078
Maybe you can help out
in some other way,

16:27.146 --> 16:28.580
but you can't be here.

16:28.647 --> 16:29.681
Hotch.
Sir, I'm sorry.

16:29.748 --> 16:31.516
Excuse me.
Go ahead, Reid.

16:33.252 --> 16:36.688
Ok, worst-case scenario-- the
children were taken at 9 p.m.

16:36.755 --> 16:40.859
That gives him roughly a 12-hour
head start at 3 miles per hour.

16:40.926 --> 16:42.360
He's got two children.

16:42.428 --> 16:45.563
At 2 miles per hour,
that's roughly a 24-mile radius,

16:45.631 --> 16:47.732
the same ground
we profiled last night.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.701
But, Hotch, if he's
an experienced tracker,

16:49.768 --> 16:51.302
he'll probably realize
he's being hunted by now

16:51.370 --> 16:52.837
and discard all nonessentials.

16:52.905 --> 16:54.172
Like Ana.

16:54.240 --> 16:56.608
She's not his type.

16:57.910 --> 16:59.143
Until we have reason
to believe otherwise,

16:59.211 --> 17:00.778
we have to assume
she's alive.

17:00.846 --> 17:03.114
We'll deliver the profile and get
search and rescue teams going.

17:52.181 --> 17:54.432
No! What are you doing?

17:54.500 --> 17:56.100
He could have poisoned that.

17:56.168 --> 17:58.002
But I'm thirsty.

18:39.244 --> 18:43.982
Come here. I want
to show you something.

18:44.049 --> 18:46.250
I don't want to leave
my sister.

18:56.095 --> 18:58.596
You want a flashlight?

19:00.099 --> 19:02.000
He'll bring you one.

19:15.381 --> 19:18.082
Robert, please don't leave me.

19:32.231 --> 19:33.631
Robert...

19:33.699 --> 19:34.982
Robert!

19:39.605 --> 19:43.774
This unsub hunts for, abducts, and
keeps his victims in the woods.

19:43.826 --> 19:45.643
We believe he left
civilization

19:45.711 --> 19:47.645
and forged a home for himself
right here in the wilderness.

19:47.713 --> 19:51.165
Which means he's lost any
societal or moral restraints.

19:51.250 --> 19:53.718
He's devoted his life
to taking children,

19:53.785 --> 19:55.687
and he's found the perfect
place to hide them.

19:55.754 --> 19:58.623
He's found or made a shelter
which is difficult to find.

19:58.691 --> 20:00.124
It allows him
to withstand harsh weather

20:00.175 --> 20:02.627
and is secure enough to keep
his victims from escaping.

20:02.695 --> 20:05.897
So it must be sizable, underground
or on a mountainside.

20:05.964 --> 20:08.900
Sometimes the voices of trapped
children gets drowned out

20:08.967 --> 20:10.518
by search parties
calling for them.

20:10.602 --> 20:12.036
Which is why
we're asking you

20:12.104 --> 20:13.521
to call out Robert
and Ana's names

20:13.605 --> 20:17.141
but leave pauses in between to
listen for their responses.

20:17.209 --> 20:19.610
Ok, let's go.

20:26.818 --> 20:28.286
Ana!

20:29.288 --> 20:31.172
Robert?

20:33.692 --> 20:38.463
Let's see, iron deposits
in McKee's pond,

20:38.530 --> 20:40.164
so the water's
undrinkable.

20:40.215 --> 20:42.049
So that would leave...

20:42.134 --> 20:45.670
I always thought I had searched
every inch of those woods.

20:47.139 --> 20:49.941
Do you ever think he ever
heard me calling his name?

20:50.008 --> 20:53.845
Even if he didn't, I'm sure he
knew you were looking for him.

20:55.848 --> 20:57.215
I was.

21:00.352 --> 21:03.287
I knew he was out there
somewhere.

21:03.355 --> 21:05.590
Mr. Lanham, do you mind if
I ask you a few questions?

21:05.691 --> 21:07.191
You know this area
better than anyone,

21:07.259 --> 21:09.594
and I think that you can
help us find these children.

21:51.103 --> 21:55.406
Robert, what happened?

21:55.474 --> 21:57.708
What happened? Tell me.

21:59.578 --> 22:03.347
Next time
he comes to get me...

22:03.415 --> 22:04.949
Run.

22:08.453 --> 22:10.321
And don't stop.

22:10.389 --> 22:13.558
No, I don't want
to go by myself.

22:15.260 --> 22:18.763
Promise.

22:18.831 --> 22:19.997
Ok, promise.

22:28.156 --> 22:29.207
Ana!

22:29.274 --> 22:30.408
Robert!

22:34.546 --> 22:36.547
Ana?!

22:36.615 --> 22:37.915
Ana!

22:39.718 --> 22:41.118
Robert!

22:42.471 --> 22:44.889
Hey, when do the temperatures
drop below freezing?

22:44.956 --> 22:47.091
By Thanksgiving
at the latest.

22:47.159 --> 22:49.560
They'd have to go
where the food supply is.

22:49.628 --> 22:51.729
And that saves us
another 5 miles.

22:51.797 --> 22:53.831
What about shelter?
Where did you stay when you were out there?

22:53.899 --> 22:56.400
I was holed up
in a cave mostly.

22:56.468 --> 22:58.169
Caves have a natural
temperature.

22:58.237 --> 23:00.855
They provide
their own heating source.

23:08.380 --> 23:10.982
I need to go
to the bathroom.

23:11.049 --> 23:12.316
Me, too.

23:17.256 --> 23:18.956
You wait.

23:19.024 --> 23:20.458
I want to go
to the bathroom.

23:20.525 --> 23:21.726
Get back.

23:27.900 --> 23:29.533
Down there.

23:29.601 --> 23:31.936
Stay! Get back!

23:32.003 --> 23:35.039
I said go! Down there.

23:36.058 --> 23:37.508
Get back!

23:37.576 --> 23:38.859
Get up!

23:40.145 --> 23:41.178
Get up!

23:41.229 --> 23:43.748
Get back! I said stay there!

23:43.815 --> 23:45.983
Aah!

23:46.034 --> 23:47.451
Run, Ana, run!

23:47.519 --> 23:48.452
Run! Run!

23:48.520 --> 23:50.988
Aah!

23:51.039 --> 23:52.123
Aah!

23:52.190 --> 23:53.190
Aah!

23:59.965 --> 24:01.499
Get away from her!

24:01.566 --> 24:02.633
Stay away from her!

24:02.701 --> 24:04.001
Get off her!
Aah!

24:04.052 --> 24:06.137
Gaahh!

24:06.204 --> 24:07.772
Aah!
Yaah!

24:10.041 --> 24:11.309
Get up!

24:11.376 --> 24:12.810
Get up!

24:50.735 --> 24:52.202
Ana?

24:52.270 --> 24:53.870
It's ok. It's ok.
Come here.

24:53.938 --> 24:55.538
My name's Emily.

24:55.590 --> 24:58.341
You're safe now.

24:58.409 --> 25:00.811
We've been looking for you
for a long time.

25:00.878 --> 25:03.346
Hey, Ana.
Where's your brother?

25:03.398 --> 25:06.850
I thought he'd run after me, but I
looked back and he wasn't there.

25:06.918 --> 25:09.953
Ana, do you know which
direction you came from?

25:10.021 --> 25:12.355
I don't know.
I just started running.

25:12.407 --> 25:15.492
Robert told me to run and not
stop running no matter what.

25:15.559 --> 25:17.494
It's ok.
You did the right thing.

25:17.561 --> 25:22.532
Listen, this nice Ranger, she's going to
take you home to your mom and dad now, ok?

25:29.974 --> 25:32.125
Get up. Get up.

25:32.210 --> 25:33.460
Get up!

25:33.544 --> 25:35.412
I can't.
I can't go any further.

25:35.480 --> 25:36.847
This is all your fault.

25:36.914 --> 25:39.716
I told you
I wouldn't hurt you.

25:39.767 --> 25:41.417
Robert!

25:41.469 --> 25:43.053
Robert!

25:48.826 --> 25:50.977
Robert!

25:54.832 --> 25:57.267
No matter
how bad things get,

25:57.318 --> 25:59.953
they can get worse.

26:07.211 --> 26:09.579
I shouldn't have
left Robert,

26:09.647 --> 26:11.081
but he told me to run.

26:11.132 --> 26:12.615
He made me promise.

26:12.667 --> 26:13.817
It's ok, baby.

26:13.885 --> 26:15.752
But he still has him.

26:15.803 --> 26:18.722
Sweetie, you did
the right thing.

26:18.790 --> 26:21.758
Ana, the man
who took you and Robert,

26:21.793 --> 26:23.527
what do you remember
about him?

26:25.196 --> 26:27.130
He smelled.

26:27.198 --> 26:28.965
He was dirty.

26:30.635 --> 26:32.235
Anything else?

26:32.303 --> 26:35.305
He was scary.

26:36.974 --> 26:38.975
And he walked funny.

26:42.747 --> 26:44.581
Like with a limp?

26:44.649 --> 26:46.149
Yeah.

26:46.217 --> 26:47.317
Good.

26:47.385 --> 26:49.019
That helps us.

26:49.086 --> 26:51.588
She must have
come through here.

26:51.655 --> 26:53.089
He's gotta have
a shelter nearby.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.551
All right,
back the dogs up.

27:05.836 --> 27:07.771
I've never seen
this cave before.

27:07.838 --> 27:10.140
It could be a den,
or it could go deep.

27:10.208 --> 27:11.808
This has gotta be it.

27:11.859 --> 27:13.676
All right, let's go.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.401
It looks like
he was in a hurry.

27:54.485 --> 27:57.220
He left some cash, a week's worth of
rations, and some clothes back there.

27:57.288 --> 27:58.405
Look at this.

27:58.489 --> 28:00.390
Pills and flowers.

28:00.458 --> 28:03.059
I don't see this guy
as a botanist.

28:03.127 --> 28:04.461
Do you think
he smokes those?

28:04.528 --> 28:05.912
This mine's
been sealed for years.

28:05.997 --> 28:08.915
The shaft goes about another
100 feet and collapses in.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.333
I also found a box of ammo

28:10.401 --> 28:11.701
but no gun.

28:11.769 --> 28:13.370
Reid, I'm sending you
a picture

28:13.437 --> 28:15.422
of a flower
this guy collects.

28:15.506 --> 28:17.841
It's loading right now.

28:17.909 --> 28:19.175
This guy's in survival mode.

28:19.243 --> 28:21.344
If he's on the run, what
does that mean for Robert?

28:21.412 --> 28:23.513
It's devil's claw.
It's a homeopathic pain treatment

28:23.581 --> 28:25.382
most commonly used
for swollen joints.

28:25.449 --> 28:28.285
The little girl told Hotch that
the unsub walked with a limp.

28:28.352 --> 28:30.754
He could be using devil's claw
as a pain treatment.

28:30.821 --> 28:32.355
The unsub needs drugs?

28:32.423 --> 28:34.791
It would explain why he's covering
less and less ground each year.

28:34.859 --> 28:38.261
You know, the thing is, though, that flower
wouldn't keep him mobile for 8 months.

28:38.329 --> 28:40.130
If he's suffering from
a degenerative disease,

28:40.197 --> 28:42.098
he'd have a hard time getting
around without painkillers.

28:42.166 --> 28:44.267
All right, come on,
let's get out of here.

28:57.632 --> 29:00.450
I'm gonna tie you.

29:01.636 --> 29:03.786
You make a sound,

29:03.838 --> 29:07.257
you run for it, you die.

29:07.308 --> 29:08.258
Got it?

29:08.309 --> 29:09.726
Let's go.

29:09.794 --> 29:11.094
Come on.

29:13.814 --> 29:16.316
All the trailheads in
the area have been closed.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.568
Rangers are processing
everyone coming off.

29:18.636 --> 29:19.936
He knows every inch
of this place.

29:20.004 --> 29:22.272
He'll get out on a route
we didn't even know existed.

29:22.340 --> 29:25.141
Guys, his first abduction off the
trail was Jonestown, Pennsylvania.

29:25.209 --> 29:26.242
What if he grew up
around here?

29:26.310 --> 29:28.445
He could have a friend
or relative in the area.

29:28.512 --> 29:30.113
The closest city is Harrisburg.

29:30.181 --> 29:33.116
He needs supplies, medication,
and a place to hide.

29:33.184 --> 29:36.886
Yeah, I don't want to hear your sob story.
Just pay me by Monday.

29:45.012 --> 29:46.296
What--who is it?

29:46.364 --> 29:48.348
Let me in.

29:53.404 --> 29:56.039
Shane, I told you if
I ever saw you again--

29:56.107 --> 29:59.709
Brandon, open this damn door
before somebody sees me.

30:03.247 --> 30:05.849
You stole my whole supply,
you son of a bitch.

30:05.916 --> 30:09.319
You know how long it took to buy back
the number of pills you ripped off?

30:09.387 --> 30:12.288
What I got's so good,
we can talk another deal.

30:12.356 --> 30:13.957
Ain't nothin' that good.

30:29.140 --> 30:30.440
What's your name?

30:38.926 --> 30:41.327
Garcia, cross-reference
your list with men convicted

30:41.395 --> 30:44.330
of sex crimes against
boys age 8 to 12

30:44.398 --> 30:47.000
in the early 1990s.
Start with Pennsylvania.

30:47.067 --> 30:50.003
He'd have stopped showing up
to parole meetings in 2001

30:50.070 --> 30:51.771
and he's been off the grid
ever since.

30:51.839 --> 30:55.641
Well, I've got
about 2 dozen of those, so--

30:55.709 --> 30:58.311
wait.

30:58.379 --> 31:01.047
Oh, this is super weird.

31:01.098 --> 31:03.383
Um...

31:03.450 --> 31:06.085
11 of these men paroled
in the early nineties

31:06.153 --> 31:08.054
have the exact same
last known address.

31:08.122 --> 31:10.923
A cluster of pervs?

31:10.991 --> 31:12.558
That rules out areas that
are near schools and parks.

31:12.626 --> 31:14.494
Housing options are limited,
to say the least.

31:14.561 --> 31:16.029
Guess that makes sense.

31:16.096 --> 31:18.131
The cluster would be
the one place they feel safe.

31:18.198 --> 31:19.449
Garcia,
what's the address?

31:19.533 --> 31:20.800
Sending it right now.

31:25.656 --> 31:27.507
I need at least
3 months' worth.

31:27.574 --> 31:29.509
That's it, Shane.
If that ain't good enough,

31:29.576 --> 31:31.310
find somewhere else to stay.

31:31.378 --> 31:33.713
I know you got more.

31:33.781 --> 31:35.965
I told you,
that's all I got.

31:36.050 --> 31:37.967
Where are you hidin' 'em?

31:40.454 --> 31:42.138
Ah, come on.

31:44.341 --> 31:45.892
Ah, please...

31:47.478 --> 31:49.562
Ho ho. Ho ho ho ho ho.

31:51.014 --> 31:53.632
Thought you said
you didn't have any more.

31:53.684 --> 31:55.468
What the hell is this?

31:55.519 --> 31:58.688
Please,
that's all I got left.

32:08.866 --> 32:11.584
Since you've been so generous,

32:11.652 --> 32:13.119
I'm gonna give you an hour.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.257
Play nice with him.

32:18.325 --> 32:19.625
I don't want any bruising.

32:26.533 --> 32:29.635
Garcia, we think the unsub might have
suffered from a degenerative disease.

32:29.703 --> 32:31.971
Can you check prison
medical records?

32:32.039 --> 32:33.473
Ok, I got him.

32:33.524 --> 32:34.674
Shane Wyland.

32:34.741 --> 32:37.677
He was incarcerated
in 1994 for...

32:37.744 --> 32:39.195
Jeez, raping
a 10-year-old.

32:39.279 --> 32:40.947
I have no idea
why he's out now.

32:41.014 --> 32:42.532
I'm sending you his mug shot.

32:42.616 --> 32:45.201
Garcia, did any of the current
residents of the cluster

32:45.285 --> 32:48.704
serve prison time with him, or
did they share a parole officer?

32:48.789 --> 32:50.723
I'm looking,
but I'm currently dice-less.

32:50.791 --> 32:52.391
He's got a kid with him,

32:52.459 --> 32:55.628
so he's gotta be going to someone
he knows wouldn't turn him in.

32:55.695 --> 32:57.730
Reid said he'd need
painkillers right away.

32:57.798 --> 32:59.132
He left his supply
in the mine.

32:59.199 --> 33:00.900
Well, there was a lot of
money left in that backpack.

33:00.968 --> 33:03.002
I don't know how much he's got on
him, but those drugs aren't cheap.

33:03.053 --> 33:05.054
But he's got Robert.

33:05.139 --> 33:06.739
To some people,
that's as good as cash.

33:18.218 --> 33:20.920
You ok, buddy?

33:25.108 --> 33:28.060
Oh, I know something
that always cheers me up.

33:29.897 --> 33:32.365
Want to watch a video?

33:32.416 --> 33:33.966
Stay away from me.

33:36.286 --> 33:38.871
Oh, don't play games now.
Hmm?

33:38.939 --> 33:41.174
Stay away from me!

33:41.241 --> 33:42.542
Come on.

33:42.609 --> 33:43.543
Come on.

33:43.610 --> 33:45.511
Come on.

33:45.579 --> 33:47.813
Uhh!

33:59.259 --> 34:01.944
You two take the front,
Rossi and I will take the back.

34:02.029 --> 34:04.363
Local P.D.'s standing by
to go in on our say-so.

34:07.534 --> 34:10.369
I'm sorry.

34:10.437 --> 34:11.737
Get up.

34:11.804 --> 34:13.121
Wake up, kid.

34:13.206 --> 34:15.308
Look, I'm sorry.

34:16.643 --> 34:18.277
Come on.

34:19.279 --> 34:21.714
He's gonna kill me.

34:21.781 --> 34:23.449
He's gonna kill me.

34:23.516 --> 34:25.885
Yeah, yeah, that's fine, well, I'm
not calling the exterminator.

34:25.952 --> 34:28.621
You can go buy yourself
some damn traps.

34:28.688 --> 34:31.724
Whoever did it,
just get them out of here.

34:31.791 --> 34:32.992
Sir, do you know
Shane Wyland?

34:33.060 --> 34:35.293
No.

34:35.362 --> 34:38.097
Have you ever seen
this kid?

34:38.165 --> 34:40.632
Definitely not.
Anybody under 18 walks in here,

34:40.684 --> 34:43.469
I got the cops on speed dial.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.271
Ok, so you want to score, who
do you go to in the building?

34:45.322 --> 34:46.438
I got nothing to do
with that.

34:46.505 --> 34:47.540
Come on, man,

34:47.608 --> 34:49.308
somebody in this building
has the hookup.

34:49.376 --> 34:51.476
Look, this place
is full of lowlifes.

34:51.545 --> 34:53.579
A lot of them
sell on the side.

34:53.647 --> 34:55.281
We're looking for someone
who would have moved in here

34:55.331 --> 34:58.317
back in the nineties.

34:58.368 --> 35:00.786
The only cat
lived here that long

35:00.854 --> 35:02.288
is Brandon Stiles.

35:02.339 --> 35:03.289
Room 408.

35:03.357 --> 35:04.290
Thank you.

35:04.341 --> 35:06.125
You tip him off,
you're an accessory.

35:07.694 --> 35:09.228
Don't make a mess.

35:32.519 --> 35:34.520
Brandon Stiles!

35:37.040 --> 35:38.190
FBI!

35:43.530 --> 35:45.081
It's clear here.

35:49.052 --> 35:50.069
Prentiss.

35:51.905 --> 35:53.556
Robert was here.

35:53.640 --> 35:55.374
Hotch, it looks like
Robert was in the room.

35:55.442 --> 35:56.876
It looks like there was
some kind of a struggle.

35:56.943 --> 35:59.044
If he managed to escape, they
could be chasing him down now.

35:59.096 --> 36:01.047
All right, you continue
to search the building.

36:01.114 --> 36:02.348
We'll cover
the surrounding area.

36:02.399 --> 36:03.399
Got it.

36:16.496 --> 36:18.531
Officers cleared
the surrounding blocks,

36:18.582 --> 36:20.933
showed Robert's picture.
No one saw anything.

36:21.001 --> 36:23.936
We need to clear every dumpster
in a 4-block radius.

36:24.004 --> 36:26.756
If things went wrong
and he killed the boy,

36:26.840 --> 36:29.625
would he take the body
out in daylight?

36:29.710 --> 36:31.944
He could get him out
in a duffel bag.

36:53.933 --> 36:56.569
East stairwell is clear.

36:56.620 --> 36:58.371
Copy that. I'm on my way.

38:24.190 --> 38:26.592
I'm not going back to prison.

38:28.929 --> 38:30.546
Uhh!

38:31.898 --> 38:33.632
Kid!

38:33.700 --> 38:35.033
Come back here!

38:42.876 --> 38:44.009
Uhh!
Come here!

38:44.077 --> 38:45.511
Don't move!

38:45.562 --> 38:48.347
I didn't take him.
Shane brought him to me.

38:48.415 --> 38:49.565
I--I didn't do anything.

38:49.649 --> 38:51.350
It's ok, Robert.
You're safe now.

38:51.418 --> 38:52.551
Get on your knees.
Get down!

38:52.569 --> 38:54.720
Where's Shane Wyland?
Where'd he go?

38:54.788 --> 38:56.121
I--I don't know.

38:56.189 --> 38:57.223
He--he just
dropped the kid off.

38:57.290 --> 38:59.191
He said he'd be back
in an hour.

38:59.259 --> 39:03.696
Hotch, we've got Robert.
Shane Wyland is not in the building,

39:03.763 --> 39:05.331
but he may be in
the immediate vicinity.

39:05.398 --> 39:06.332
Let's go.

39:06.399 --> 39:08.434
Get up. Get up!

39:16.676 --> 39:17.977
He got away.

39:20.797 --> 39:22.081
What about the kid?

39:22.148 --> 39:23.749
He's headed to the hospital.

39:24.751 --> 39:26.552
Uh...We, uh...

39:26.620 --> 39:28.454
We found this
in the mine shaft.

39:32.526 --> 39:34.727
It's Daniel's.

39:34.794 --> 39:37.263
I'm sorry, Mr. Lanham.

40:05.458 --> 40:07.192
How often does that happen?

40:15.569 --> 40:17.670
Not often enough.

40:24.995 --> 40:28.113
Shane must have seen the police
presence and just taken off.

40:28.181 --> 40:29.348
It was easy for him.

40:29.416 --> 40:30.649
Robert's a tough kid.

40:30.717 --> 40:33.118
Knowing he fought back will
help him get through this.

40:33.186 --> 40:35.754
In my entire career,
I've only brought back

40:35.822 --> 40:39.325
a handful of kids to their
parents after the 24-hour mark.

40:39.392 --> 40:42.628
This is not a loss in my book.

40:42.696 --> 40:45.831
Before now, nobody knew that there was
a pedophile hunting on the trail.

40:45.899 --> 40:47.800
Now we know who he is
and what he looks like.

40:47.867 --> 40:50.302
His photo's been sent to
all the Ranger stations.

40:50.370 --> 40:51.971
Do you think
he'll go back there?

40:52.038 --> 40:54.873
Well, he can't function
anywhere else.

40:54.941 --> 40:57.109
He's got no place to hide.
We've taken that away from him.

40:57.177 --> 40:59.144
It's just hard to accept
there's no justice

40:59.212 --> 41:02.114
for the families
he destroyed.

41:02.182 --> 41:03.849
We'll get him.

41:28.408 --> 41:29.908
Elise Cabot said,

41:29.976 --> 41:32.011
"evil endures a moment's flush

41:32.062 --> 41:35.080
and then leaves
but a burnt-out shell."
