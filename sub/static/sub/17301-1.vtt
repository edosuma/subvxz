00:02.695 --> 00:08.335
On tonight's Top Gear, Richard
Hammond in a V8 tumble dryer. Ow!

00:08.335 --> 00:12.575
The classiest way
to bankrupt yourself. Wow!

00:12.575 --> 00:17.376
And we turn up the heat
on the world's dullest car.

00:19.555 --> 00:23.495
Hello, and may I say how nice it is
to be back,

00:23.495 --> 00:28.255
especially as 2003 is likely
to be a vintage year for cars.

00:28.255 --> 00:32.534
Honestly, you will not believe
the list of what's coming.

00:32.534 --> 00:37.735
And it's not all big, expensive,
tyre-shredding stuff either.

00:37.735 --> 00:41.935
There's a trend
towards small, affordable, fun cars,

00:41.935 --> 00:45.635
stuff that looks good
in a traffic jam.

00:45.635 --> 00:49.435
Take this
Volkswagen Beetle Cabriolet.

00:49.435 --> 00:54.745
It's not the fastest car in
the world, or even in this studio,

00:54.745 --> 00:59.195
and the roof folding arrangement
is a bit... unfortunate.

00:59.195 --> 01:03.915
But it has four seats,
costs £15,000, and look at it!

01:03.915 --> 01:07.475
And then there's the Ford Streetka.

01:07.475 --> 01:10.995
This has a top speed of 12.5 miles
an hour.

01:10.995 --> 01:15.545
But that's OK,
because it only costs 12.5p.

01:15.545 --> 01:19.875
The most intriguing car, though,
is that.

01:19.875 --> 01:22.785
It's the Smart Roadster.

01:22.785 --> 01:28.565
Now, some cars are rock'n'roll.
Some cars are the 1812 Overture.

01:28.565 --> 01:31.568
This... is a pop video.

01:53.585 --> 01:57.905
In the trendiest parts
of the trendiest postcodes

01:57.905 --> 02:02.865
of the trendiest city in Britain,
this car looks sensational.

02:08.455 --> 02:14.465
And because it's only £13,500,
no-one thinks you're a rich git.

02:14.465 --> 02:20.028
It's the kind of car that makes
people go, "Ah!", rather than "Ugh!"

02:23.535 --> 02:27.105
But for fashion accessories to work,

02:27.105 --> 02:30.165
they need a real-world application.

02:30.165 --> 02:34.225
A pretty watch
still has to work in space.

02:34.225 --> 02:38.055
A Range Rover has to work on an alp,
even in Kettering.

02:38.055 --> 02:42.825
A training shoe has to work in
a gym, even if you never get there.

02:42.825 --> 02:47.465
It's no good the Smart
being all rinky-dinky in Camden.

02:47.465 --> 02:49.985
If it's to have any street cred,

02:49.985 --> 02:53.227
it has to work out here.

02:54.265 --> 02:57.265
It's got to be a proper sports car.

02:57.265 --> 02:59.785
So is it?

02:59.785 --> 03:03.448
MUSIC: "Sexy Boy" by Air

03:09.425 --> 03:12.485
On paper, things don't look great.

03:12.485 --> 03:16.425
It may make
all the right growly noises,

03:16.425 --> 03:20.705
but it's powered
by a three-cylinder, 600cc engine.

03:20.705 --> 03:24.368
My Moulinex Magimix
has a bigger motor!

03:25.825 --> 03:30.625
Sure, the Smart has a turbocharger,
but only get 80bhp.

03:30.625 --> 03:33.345
So this then, is not a fast car.

03:33.345 --> 03:38.590
In fact, it has exactly
the same top speed as Henry VIII.

03:40.465 --> 03:46.347
In terms of acceleration,
you go from 0-60, but only just.

03:49.885 --> 03:55.585
I tried timing it,
but after 11 seconds, I got bored.

04:08.425 --> 04:13.165
There's the six-speed sequential
Formula 1-style gearbox too,

04:13.165 --> 04:17.935
which operates like one of those
new-fangled digital cameras,

04:17.935 --> 04:24.395
where you push the button,
and ten seconds later, just as your
subject moves, it takes the picture.

04:24.395 --> 04:26.925
Ready, foot down...

04:26.925 --> 04:29.455
and here we go.

04:29.455 --> 04:31.457
Useless!

04:36.025 --> 04:38.535
It rather looks, then,

04:38.535 --> 04:43.295
Iike the Smart Roadster misses
the sports car mark by 100 miles.

04:43.295 --> 04:45.835
However, have a look at this.

04:45.835 --> 04:48.325
Push a button...

04:48.325 --> 04:53.855
and the middle part of the roof
slides back into a little cubbyhole

04:53.855 --> 04:56.485
in the engine compartment.

04:56.485 --> 04:59.435
And then I simply take these out,

04:59.435 --> 05:02.725
and we've got a full convertible.

05:02.725 --> 05:06.755
However, the weather today
is a bit too British,

05:06.755 --> 05:10.285
so if you don't mind, I'll just...

05:10.285 --> 05:13.195
I'll just pop it back.

05:13.195 --> 05:15.516
See ya.

05:26.535 --> 05:31.285
There's more good stuff too.
This car may not be fast,

05:31.285 --> 05:36.495
but it feels more alive than any
million-horsepower heavyweight BMW.

05:36.495 --> 05:39.995
I wanted to hate it.

05:39.995 --> 05:44.675
I wanted to laugh at its
performance and call it a wet fraud,

05:44.675 --> 05:48.015
but it's so responsive
and such a giggle

05:48.015 --> 05:50.677
that it puts a smile on your face!

05:54.055 --> 05:56.603
It's fantastic!

05:57.855 --> 06:00.597
Ha-ha!

06:03.815 --> 06:08.795
I like the styling, the interior,
the traction control, the CD player.

06:08.795 --> 06:13.195
I like how these dials
sprout out of the dashboard.

06:13.195 --> 06:19.805
And I love the space.
I'm not small, but look at that!
Four inches of headroom there.

06:22.195 --> 06:24.715
Ooh, and there's something else.

06:24.715 --> 06:29.195
Remember who it is
that makes Smarts?

06:29.195 --> 06:31.695
You can buy one of these things

06:31.695 --> 06:39.335
and say you drive a mid-engined,
rear wheel drive, turbocharged
convertible Mercedes Benz.

06:39.335 --> 06:44.796
Mercedes own Smart. They make them
in France, but this is a Mercedes.

06:46.355 --> 06:52.795
There's more! It's cheap to insure,
does 40 miles to the gallon,
and it costs almost nothing

06:52.795 --> 06:57.085
to replace those plastic
body panels if you crash.

06:57.085 --> 07:01.115
Not that it goes fast enough
to have a crash.

07:01.115 --> 07:03.805
So, it works.

07:03.805 --> 07:08.555
It's a fashion accessory,
a piece of automotive jewellery,

07:08.555 --> 07:15.355
and it's like those whizzing sports
cars from the '50s,
Austin Healeys and so on.

07:15.355 --> 07:19.405
It's a proper, undiluted,
sports car.

07:23.265 --> 07:29.795
l would'nt buy one. I'm going 
to outline a few problems.

07:29.795 --> 07:32.365
We'll start with the boot.

07:32.365 --> 07:37.075
There isn't one! It's under here.
No point looking. That's your lot.

07:37.075 --> 07:39.625
It's a baking tray above the engine.

07:39.625 --> 07:44.645
It's OK if you've got a handful
of roast potatoes to carry around,

07:44.645 --> 07:47.185
but otherwise, useless.

07:47.185 --> 07:49.695
However, look at this.

07:49.695 --> 07:52.445
This is the Smart Roadster Coupe.

07:52.445 --> 07:56.475
Same engine, same roof arrangement,
same everything,

07:56.475 --> 07:59.125
but if we open the back...

07:59.125 --> 08:03.195
Ah! Enough space
for a whole sackful of King Edwards!

08:03.195 --> 08:07.565
There you go. I wouldn't buy this
either. Because?

08:07.565 --> 08:10.085
I'll tell you why, OK?

08:10.085 --> 08:14.705
You can buy one of these
with left-hand drive in Britain

08:14.705 --> 08:17.795
for less than £10,000.

08:17.795 --> 08:21.765
It's not as powerful
as the British ones,

08:21.765 --> 08:28.365
but why are we paying
half as much again to have
the steering wheel on our side?

08:28.365 --> 08:32.845
I love the car, but I won't
be ripped off by Germans.

08:32.845 --> 08:36.985
It's made in France!
Yeah, Vichy France!

08:36.985 --> 08:41.284
The thing for me is that gearbox.
It's just hopeless.

08:41.284 --> 08:44.205
The moment builds up, the revs rise,

08:44.205 --> 08:48.305
you hit the lever,
and it pauses with you and waits.

08:48.305 --> 08:50.845
Nothing happens for so long.

08:50.845 --> 08:55.165
It's a gearbox.
It has one job to do.

08:55.165 --> 09:00.485
Pull the lever, and...
"Am I a pencil? Am I a cauliflower?

09:00.485 --> 09:05.645
"I'm a gearbox! Oh, heavens,
I must swap some cogs around!"

09:05.645 --> 09:10.845
It takes forever. The problem is,
you'll be using it a lot,

09:10.845 --> 09:16.205
because of that buzzy 600cc engine.
I was wrong. Ah. Admission time.

09:16.205 --> 09:19.965
It's actually a 700cc engine,
which is different.

09:19.965 --> 09:22.705
It's 0.7 of a litre.

09:22.705 --> 09:26.225
That still has Hugh Grant
as a gearbox.

09:26.225 --> 09:30.365
It's a pity. We like the Smart,
but we think not.

09:30.365 --> 09:32.865
That gives us another problem.

09:32.865 --> 09:37.845
Because, you see, you can't have
the Volkswagen Beetle either.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.385
And let me explain why.

09:40.385 --> 09:45.125
With most convertibles,
the windscreen is sort of here.

09:45.125 --> 09:52.045
But this is like a convertible
people-carrier! You could play
football on that dashboard!

09:52.045 --> 09:56.085
You need binoculars to see
if the wipers work!

09:56.085 --> 10:00.845
That leaves us with the Ford
Streetka. It is a very good car.

10:00.845 --> 10:04.595
It does everything it sets out
to do.

10:04.595 --> 10:09.405
But you cannot possibly drive
this car if you're a man.

10:09.405 --> 10:13.935
Seriously! Look, there's a man
in the car,

10:13.935 --> 10:18.935
and he is clearly wearing a dress!
Is he not?

10:18.935 --> 10:24.335
Would any men here think
of buying this car? Precisely. No?

10:24.335 --> 10:29.085
This being the Top Gear audience,
you're all car enthusiasts,

10:29.085 --> 10:34.055
so you haven't got wives or
girlfriends. What about the girls?

10:34.055 --> 10:37.525
Hands up, girls who would like
this car.

10:37.525 --> 10:40.395
Are there any girls who wouldn't?

10:40.395 --> 10:44.465
You? Well, put your hand up, then!
It's not difficult!

10:44.465 --> 10:48.395
Brothers and sisters,
they're all related!

10:48.395 --> 10:52.435
I was talking the other day
to a guy from Ford.

10:52.435 --> 10:55.095
Don't know who he was. Wore a suit.

10:55.095 --> 11:00.340
Anyway, he said 80% of these
are going to be sold to women.

11:01.355 --> 11:05.185
Who's going to buy the other 20%?
LAUGHTER

11:05.185 --> 11:09.955
So, what if a bloke wants to buy
a two-seater, open-top sports car?

11:09.955 --> 11:14.835
He does what he's done for the last
14 years, and buys a Mazda MX-5.

11:14.835 --> 11:17.875
Where do these go on the Cool wall?

11:17.875 --> 11:22.735
This is nothing to do with dodgy
gearboxes or value for money,

11:22.735 --> 11:25.175
but how cool we think the cars are.

11:25.175 --> 11:28.355
First, the VW Beetle convertible.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.735
That's a cool car.
Higher, put it higher.

11:31.735 --> 11:35.735
LAUGHTER
Higher, no.

11:35.735 --> 11:40.095
No, up there.
Actually, move it into Uncool.

11:40.095 --> 11:43.795
I kinda like it there, personally.

11:43.795 --> 11:48.455
The Streetka. It is very much
not a car for a bloke.

11:48.455 --> 11:51.355
But it is a cool car. We all agreed?

11:51.355 --> 11:53.875
AUDIENCE: Yes.

11:53.875 --> 11:58.968
So that leaves us with the
Smart car. Anyone got any thoughts?

11:58.968 --> 12:01.698
AUDIENCE SHOUTS

12:01.698 --> 12:08.498
Sub Zero. Why? It's the coolest car
here. The Smart is? Easily. Good man.

12:08.498 --> 12:11.408
Where's it going? Uncool. Sub Zero.

12:11.408 --> 12:14.888
You're right, you're wrong,
I'm always right.

12:14.888 --> 12:18.358
It's going there cos I know
everything. Always right? Yeah.

12:19.828 --> 12:21.958
I've had a new idea
while we've been off the air.

12:22.398 --> 12:26.388
It's this, the Top Gear Love & Hate
board. The Love section's full.

12:26.388 --> 12:29.778
Kristin Scott Thomas
and Terry-Thomas.

12:29.778 --> 12:34.408
We're most interested in this bit,
the Hate section, things we hate.

12:34.408 --> 12:39.048
Like stereos that have a chummy
greeting when you turn them on.

12:39.048 --> 12:43.588
Why?! Why does it have to say hello?
I just want it to play Terry Wogan.

12:43.588 --> 12:47.628
Other things we hate, obviously,
paddle shifts.

12:47.628 --> 12:51.098
Those semi-automatic
gearboxes like Formula One.

12:51.098 --> 12:56.548
Personalised registration plates?
Yes? We really hate those.

12:56.548 --> 12:58.648
LAUGHTER

12:58.648 --> 13:02.468
I thought about stuff that I hate

13:02.468 --> 13:05.178
and came up with a list.

13:05.178 --> 13:11.308
A man can never have too many. It's
my top five worst cars ever. Good.

13:11.308 --> 13:16.108
Top five worst cars ever...
Well, here's my list, OK? Mm-hm.

13:16.108 --> 13:19.728
In fifth place is the AMC Pacer.

13:19.728 --> 13:22.648
What a moose! That IS a moose.

13:22.648 --> 13:27.128
The doors on each side
aren't even the same length!

13:27.128 --> 13:31.128
At number four is the Peel!

13:31.128 --> 13:34.848
It only had one head lamp. It did.

13:34.848 --> 13:41.108
If one came towards you, you thought
it was a motorbike. "It's a car!"

13:41.108 --> 13:46.528
In third place, the Vauxhall Vectra.
Obviously. In second place -

13:46.528 --> 13:51.248
the Suzuki X90.
I road-tested that on old Top Gear.

13:51.248 --> 13:56.128
We filmed at night cos I didn't
want people to see me in it!

13:56.128 --> 13:59.308
In first place, it's a big question.

13:59.308 --> 14:03.208
My worst car ever.
What are we looking for?

14:03.208 --> 14:07.508
The car equivalent of drizzle.

14:07.508 --> 14:12.928
No. Because there's something
going on. We want worse than that.

14:12.928 --> 14:17.608
It's like those days when you
walk out and there is no weather.

14:17.608 --> 14:22.178
There's only one car
that can manage that. And it's this.

14:22.178 --> 14:26.728
The Nissan Sunny.
I don't know where to start.

14:26.728 --> 14:30.738
There are uglier cars
and worse cars to drive.

14:30.738 --> 14:34.508
But their badness
gives them character.

14:34.508 --> 14:38.538
This commits the worst crime -
blandness.

14:38.538 --> 14:42.938
God gave us celery as the benchmark

14:42.938 --> 14:45.578
of nothingness.

14:45.578 --> 14:48.568
Then mankind improved on that

14:48.568 --> 14:53.908
with this...thing - I hesitate
even to call it an abomination.

14:53.908 --> 14:59.738
Forget redeeming features,
it doesn't have any features.

14:59.738 --> 15:04.558
Something else I don't get.
Dragsters. It has a big engine.

15:04.558 --> 15:07.058
That's jet engine.

15:07.058 --> 15:09.968
It will do 0-200mph in 3. 8 seconds,

15:09.968 --> 15:13.918
but it struggles
to better 100 gallons to the mile,

15:13.918 --> 15:18.978
and every time you want to get
into it, you've gotta split in half.

15:18.978 --> 15:23.848
And I don't think
it's even got a reverse gear.

15:23.848 --> 15:26.726
But they do have one useful feature.

15:28.938 --> 15:32.726
Get 'em working.

15:38.538 --> 15:43.100
AUDIENCE LAUGHS

15:56.078 --> 16:00.629
APPLAUSE

16:02.318 --> 16:05.358
How much fun was that?! Fantastic!

16:05.358 --> 16:10.298
We have a theme. Jeremy's looked
at smart roadsters, small cars.

16:10.298 --> 16:13.238
Cheap thrills is the kind of feel.

16:13.238 --> 16:17.298
That dragster
did burn about £100-worth of fuel.

16:17.298 --> 16:21.518
The best £100 you could ever spend.
LAUGHTER

16:21.518 --> 16:26.418
Footballers. The time was, not that
I know, when it was a great game.

16:26.418 --> 16:31.177
The men were men and
in the wall they stood like that.

16:31.177 --> 16:34.107
Now it's this, "Ooh, mind me hair! "

16:34.107 --> 16:38.557
But my guest tonight
is from those olden days.

16:38.557 --> 16:42.477
He'd drive
a large Mercedes to a fight

16:42.477 --> 16:45.397
and a football game might break out.

16:45.397 --> 16:49.917
He's now an actor and
has his own fly-on-the-wall series.

16:49.917 --> 16:52.757
Ladies and gentlemen, Vinnie Jones!

16:52.757 --> 16:57.117
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

16:57.117 --> 17:01.747
Vinnie, how are you? How are ya?
Have a seat.

17:01.747 --> 17:07.537
APPLAUSE

17:07.537 --> 17:13.337
You hold the world record for being
sent off in a game of football.

17:13.337 --> 17:19.537
It is five seconds, isn't it? Yeah.
I ran on and it was like a minute.

17:19.537 --> 17:23.487
No, you've done it in five seconds.
No, about a second.

17:23.487 --> 17:29.397
I'm intrigued, not being
a footballist, how do you reach

17:29.397 --> 17:34.877
an opposing player to commit
an atrocity in that time?

17:34.877 --> 17:37.547
I'd need a minute and a half...

17:37.547 --> 17:40.857
As the ref looked at the goalkeepers,

17:40.857 --> 17:44.767
as he put the whistle to his mouth,
I set off.

17:44.767 --> 17:48.877
So as he blew, I crossed the line
at full speed.

17:48.877 --> 17:53.267
When they knocked it to each other,
they saw me coming.

17:53.267 --> 17:57.117
It's blow the whistle now.
Vinnie booked now.

17:57.117 --> 18:00.047
It's such an achievement.

18:00.047 --> 18:03.977
Now, your driving.
What was your first car?

18:03.977 --> 18:08.347
I had a bit of money from playing
in Sweden

18:08.347 --> 18:11.197
and I bought a red Cortina. Ooh.

18:11.197 --> 18:14.327
Which mark? A Mark Four. Mark Four?

18:14.327 --> 18:17.197
Then, Wimbledon were very basic.

18:17.197 --> 18:21.967
Meself, Dave Beasant and the physio
went there and I wanted to drive

18:21.967 --> 18:24.997
and we took the team kit with us.

18:24.997 --> 18:29.487
We get to Chelsea and they say,
"You're not coming in. "

18:29.487 --> 18:35.407
I said, "I'm a player. " By the time
he had finished, it had overheated.

18:35.407 --> 18:40.487
The smoke was coming through
the vents. It was hilarious.

18:40.487 --> 18:44.767
We took the kit out, pushed it
in the car park and it stayed there.

18:44.767 --> 18:47.547
I don't know what happened to it.

18:47.547 --> 18:53.207
They've redone Chelsea now. I'm
sure. Ken Bates probably nicked it!

18:53.207 --> 18:57.827
We'll look out for him. You're
over in America a lot these days.

18:57.827 --> 19:02.927
Do they have the first idea
what you are, who you are?

19:02.927 --> 19:07.927
I sort of get more... credibility
when they come and talk to you

19:07.927 --> 19:10.927
and realise you was a footballer.

19:10.927 --> 19:15.467
AMERICAN ACCENT:
"He was a soccer player? "

19:15.467 --> 19:22.807
I mean Nick Cage... You were in
Gone In 60 Seconds. Good car film.
Yeah. Is he a car nut? Yeah.

19:22.807 --> 19:27.027
He used to come down to work,
say, in his Bentley.

19:27.027 --> 19:31.847
Then a Ferrari would turn up,
then a great big motorbike

19:31.847 --> 19:36.707
and when we'd finished, he'd be
there, "What shall I go home in? "

19:36.707 --> 19:39.907
He went on his motorbike one day

19:39.907 --> 19:44.887
and we were pulling out and tried
to follow him up the motorway.

19:44.887 --> 19:51.467
He was just gone! It must be great
for him with the crash helmet on.
No-one knows who he is.

19:51.467 --> 19:54.607
Lock Stock started it all. Yeah.

19:54.607 --> 19:58.647
You know the scene
of you with the car door? Yeah.

19:58.647 --> 20:04.617
What was going through your head
when you were doing that?

20:04.617 --> 20:09.227
I can't say it on air.
I'd get sued again! Whisper it.

20:09.227 --> 20:16.287
We were thinking, that P6,
big heavy doors in those days. Yes.
Good for smashing a man's head in.

20:16.287 --> 20:21.207
Modern cars - we're not so sure.
Can you pass us our prop?

20:21.207 --> 20:23.857
The windows would go now. Exactly.

20:23.857 --> 20:29.907
Imagine this.
We've all seen Day Of The Jackal.
If you could come with me, Vinnie.

20:29.907 --> 20:35.347
I want you to try and smash this
in the door of one of our cars.

20:35.347 --> 20:39.217
Gather round.
We're going to this Smart car. Oh!

20:39.217 --> 20:44.677
It's made of plastic. It hasn't got
to go back, has it? What? It has.

20:44.677 --> 20:49.707
I'd like you to re-enact the scene.
Put it in from the other side.

20:49.707 --> 20:55.077
It was a block of wood in Lock Stock.
It's a heavy watermelon in this.

20:55.077 --> 20:57.507
Right, here we go.

20:57.507 --> 21:00.397
Ready? Yeah, here we go.

21:00.397 --> 21:02.917
Not bad! In one!

21:02.917 --> 21:06.865
APPLAUSE

21:08.197 --> 21:10.117
So...

21:10.117 --> 21:17.827
So, a little bit of The Day Of The
Jackal, little bit of Lock Stock,
little bit of Top Gear all in one!

21:17.827 --> 21:22.677
Now, you haven't just come here...
Can you hang on to that?

21:22.677 --> 21:25.307
Do the garden, mate! Yes!

21:25.307 --> 21:32.527
You haven't just come here to smash
watermelons to pieces. You've come
to do a lap on our track.

21:32.527 --> 21:36.117
You went with the Stig.
What was that like?

21:36.117 --> 21:40.677
When the backside stops retracting,
I'll let you know!

21:40.677 --> 21:44.257
It is time to see how you got on
in your lap.

21:44.257 --> 21:49.277
This is the power board. I want to
beat Jonathan Ross. I've got to.

21:49.277 --> 21:55.197
Ross, one minute 57. You could have
strolled! Shall we see how you did?

21:55.197 --> 22:00.117
A Star In A Reasonably Priced Car.
Play it. Oooh!

22:00.117 --> 22:02.597
Nice start.

22:02.597 --> 22:06.537
Come on, girl. 'It looks very slow. '

22:06.537 --> 22:09.967
It seemed faster
when I was doing it!

22:09.967 --> 22:13.437
It is a Suzuki Liana.
It's not a fast car.

22:13.437 --> 22:20.477
If you lose speed here,
you'll never get it back all
the way up the main straight.

22:20.477 --> 22:23.237
'This is the home bit. '

22:23.237 --> 22:27.157
This is where everyone goes off.
How do you manage?

22:27.157 --> 22:30.097
I'm still in. Boot it!

22:30.097 --> 22:36.807
You kept it on the island and that
was where Gambon nearly rolled it.
You're across the line!

22:36.807 --> 22:40.197
APPLAUSE

22:42.807 --> 22:49.687
Seemed a bit slow. I've been
told the time. Go on. You want to
be faster than Jonathan Ross. Yeah.

22:49.687 --> 22:54.797
I pity Jonathan if you aren't
faster! Rossy will not let me...

22:54.797 --> 22:57.607
Vinnie J, one minute...

22:57.607 --> 23:00.097
50... 51?

23:00.097 --> 23:03.976
Three! 53! You're in there
faster than Ross Kemp.

23:05.667 --> 23:09.297
Ladies and gentlemen, Vinnie Jones!

23:09.297 --> 23:13.279
APPLAUSE

23:16.037 --> 23:22.077
This being a new series
of Top Gear, we thought
we'd try out a new presenter.

23:22.077 --> 23:24.727
He's called James May.

23:24.727 --> 23:30.563
On the evidence of what we're about
to see, he is a blithering idiot!

23:40.687 --> 23:44.917
One day, probably in the dentist,
you'll leaf idly

23:44.917 --> 23:49.997
through the small ads in the back
of a classic car magazine.

23:49.997 --> 23:57.957
You'll probably think, "That money
I spent on a Mondeo could have been
spent on something interesting... "

23:57.957 --> 24:02.927
Like an Inspector-Morse-style Jag,
for example, a Porsche 911...

24:02.927 --> 24:05.797
There are a lot of old 911s in here.

24:05.797 --> 24:09.187
You could even have a Bentley.

24:12.717 --> 24:17.567
Mind you, you'd have to be a
complete idiot to buy one of those.

24:17.567 --> 24:20.195
This one's mine.

24:21.487 --> 24:26.083
It's a T2, pretty much
the cheapest Bentley money can buy.

24:27.487 --> 24:31.447
You can pick one of these up
for seven grand.

24:31.447 --> 24:36.287
Don't. For that money it's gonna be
a complete bag of bolts.

24:36.287 --> 24:41.167
'This is a good 'un. It cost
£14,000, the parts are genuine,

24:41.167 --> 24:46.327
'there's no rust, no filler
and no evidence of bodged repairs.

24:46.327 --> 24:51.567
'14 grand's a lot for this, but
only the price of a basic Mondeo.

24:51.567 --> 24:56.487
'Unlike the Mondeo, though,
the Bentley shouldn't depreciate.

24:56.487 --> 25:00.967
'A Mondeo is disposable,
but a Bentley's...a Bentley. '

25:00.967 --> 25:03.607
So why do I like it then?

25:03.607 --> 25:08.617
Well... I like this wood. Someone's
taken a lot of care of that.

25:08.617 --> 25:14.187
I like the strip of chrome down the
bonnet and the weird winged thing.

25:14.187 --> 25:19.127
I like the sort of daftness of it.
The light switch is there.

25:19.127 --> 25:23.687
The key goes here
and the windscreen wipers are here.

25:23.687 --> 25:27.467
I'd expect the wipers to be here
but it's the gear stick.

25:27.467 --> 25:31.995
The handbrake's down here.
'It's all wrong and I love that. '

25:35.107 --> 25:39.787
'Somewhere up front is
a huge 6.7 5-litre V8 engine.

25:39.787 --> 25:43.637
'But when you put
your foot down... '

25:43.637 --> 25:46.067
nothing happens.

25:46.067 --> 25:52.137
It might go a bit faster,
but on the whole, it's a complete
waste of time.

25:52.137 --> 25:55.187
You might as well just relax!

25:55.187 --> 26:00.027
Handling. I've got furniture that
handles better than this thing.

26:00.027 --> 26:02.927
Watch. Absolutely nothing.

26:02.927 --> 26:09.587
'So, it's rubbish to drive,
I'm going slower than you and yes,
I look like a failed porn star.

26:09.587 --> 26:12.806
'But I am in my own Bentley!

26:14.747 --> 26:19.161
'Right then,
a Bentley for Mondeo money. '

26:23.387 --> 26:31.027
Some of you are pretty tempted
by this idea, but I haven't told
you how it ruined my life yet!

26:31.027 --> 26:34.477
'I said this car doesn't depreciate.

26:34.477 --> 26:41.157
'Big deal! Who really cares
about depreciation? It's something
that goes on all the time.

26:41.157 --> 26:43.867
'It doesn't hurt you every day.

26:43.867 --> 26:46.657
'For that you need a Bentley.

26:46.657 --> 26:52.327
'Every time I go near this thing,
it runs off with my wallet.

26:52.327 --> 27:00.157
'It costs 80 quid to fill up and
does 15 miles to the gallon. I have
to rent a garage to keep it in.

27:00.157 --> 27:04.197
'It takes up two tokens
at the jetwash.

27:04.197 --> 27:09.037
'Servicing only costs the same
as it does for a mid-size BMW,

27:09.037 --> 27:12.197
'but it has to go in more often.

27:12.197 --> 27:19.037
'That's why my mechanic buys
his overalls from Gucci
while I sit at home eating gruel. '

27:19.037 --> 27:23.417
Cheap thrills? Humph, try this!
It's bloody terrifying!

27:37.816 --> 27:42.206
You rent a garage
seven miles from your house?

27:42.206 --> 27:46.736
Mmm. How do you get there?
On my folding bicycle!

27:46.736 --> 27:52.496
You are mad! You're just insane
running a car like this.

27:52.496 --> 27:57.486
I think you may be missing an
essential point. Comfy, though!

27:57.486 --> 28:00.416
This has firm suspension! Really?

28:00.416 --> 28:06.076
The "T" is for firm suspension. It
has the Harvey Bailey handling kit.

28:06.076 --> 28:10.206
Harvey didn't know anything
about suspension either!

28:10.206 --> 28:17.006
Despite all that, of all the cars
in this studio, this one
is actually the cheapest. No.

28:17.006 --> 28:21.136
The Smart's cheaper.
For £500 less you can have a Smart.

28:21.136 --> 28:23.726
Well... Which doesn't do this.

28:23.726 --> 28:28.816
This would have been cheaper
if I'd haggled a bit more.

28:28.816 --> 28:32.836
That's a British disease. It is.

28:32.836 --> 28:37.676
Am I right in saying this car
is so cool, that most people,

28:37.676 --> 28:42.476
by which I mean Jeremy,
don't realise it? AUDIENCE: Yes!

28:42.476 --> 28:47.236
Hands up if you think
it's a cool car. That's three.

28:47.236 --> 28:50.696
And on that bombshell,
let's do the news.

28:50.696 --> 28:53.556
News first of two hot new Peugeots.

28:53.556 --> 28:57.176
The first of them
is the new 206 GTI.

28:57.176 --> 28:59.526
It's 180bhp.

28:59.526 --> 29:05.656
That's quite a lot in a small car.
£14,995, which isn't bad.
That is a hot car.

29:05.656 --> 29:09.696
The second one...
I can't quite understand this.

29:09.696 --> 29:14.496
It's a 206, it's a GTi,
it's 138bhp, slightly less powerful,

29:14.496 --> 29:18.856
but you'll notice it's an estate,
a tiny estate car.

29:18.856 --> 29:24.336
That, to me, is pointless.
More than that, it's a tragedy.

29:24.336 --> 29:29.776
That's what the French call
"idiotique". Yes! Don't like it.

29:29.776 --> 29:34.926
I like it. Why? Cos the 206 is
a good car. Are we all agreed?

29:34.926 --> 29:39.976
Yeah. It's a good hatchback. It's
a good car with space for your dog!

29:39.976 --> 29:43.036
You can get a dog in a hatchback!

29:43.036 --> 29:47.096
No, you can't. A big dog
won't go in a 206. Hang on.

29:47.096 --> 29:54.836
Hang on. A dog is for life.
If you've got a big dog already,
you specify a big estate car.

29:54.836 --> 30:02.276
If you already have a small car,
get a small dog like one of those
mutants that come third at Crufts.

30:02.276 --> 30:07.376
If you had a dog and you needed
the space, I think that's great.

30:07.376 --> 30:10.906
Not if you're British -
we like dogs.

30:10.906 --> 30:16.196
Yes. But it's French and they can
put a red setter in a Renault 5.

30:16.196 --> 30:19.856
And they crush it in so tightly,

30:19.856 --> 30:25.506
that it looks like a photo of a dog
stuck on the window of the car.

30:25.506 --> 30:30.946
I consider myself outvoted then -
Peugeot 206 Estate, silly car.

30:30.946 --> 30:32.746
Silly. Silly.

30:32.746 --> 30:37.946
Good news for car fans and film
buffs - we like films and cars -

30:37.946 --> 30:42.636
The Italian Job,
a great film if you love cars.

30:42.636 --> 30:46.986
There's a remake coming up
by the Americans.

30:46.986 --> 30:49.556
Oh, God, oh!

30:49.556 --> 30:54.986
There will be a few differences.
The previous one was shot in Turin.

30:54.986 --> 31:01.146
Beautiful city.
The new one will be shot
in the beautiful city of LA.

31:01.146 --> 31:04.336
Right.
Technically, it isn't Italian.

31:04.336 --> 31:09.353
Hang on - if it's not in Italy,
is it going to be called The Job?

31:11.155 --> 31:16.285
It doesn't say that there's going
to be a job. Just "The". "The"!

31:16.285 --> 31:21.645
And who's playing Michael Caine?
Vin Diesel, he does everything else.

31:21.645 --> 31:25.755
Who did they get
for the remake of Get Carter?

31:25.755 --> 31:28.705
Stallone. Stallone. Yeah.

31:28.705 --> 31:33.825
He can't go, "You're only supposed
to blow the bloody doors off. " No!

31:33.825 --> 31:40.505
The thing is, when it ends and
the bus teeters on the brink
of disaster, and he says,

31:40.505 --> 31:46.575
"I have a great idea," if he's
American, it won't be a great idea.

31:46.575 --> 31:47.985
True!

31:47.985 --> 31:53.495
There's an explosion and British
people are killed by accident.

31:53.495 --> 31:58.565
And Tom Cruise will come down
in a parachute.

31:58.565 --> 32:01.765
Yeah. And it'll be a rubbish film.

32:01.765 --> 32:06.585
What else is in the news? Are we
going to bother to go and see that?

32:06.585 --> 32:12.905
If a film comes to a cinema
near you called... What did you say?
"The". Exactly.

32:12.905 --> 32:19.585
New cars since we've been off air -
Renault Kangoo. Interested, anyone?
AUDIENCE: No. I am.

32:19.585 --> 32:25.005
£9,100 - it's a van with windows,
a bit like the Citroen Berlingo.

32:25.005 --> 32:28.265
A little bit more expensive.

32:28.265 --> 32:31.305
I quite like those cars, actually.

32:31.305 --> 32:38.065
The Saab 93 Convertible -
they took a tin-opener to the 93,
which I think is a Vectra.

32:38.065 --> 32:43.035
You're the expert. It is a Vectra,
but it's got a Saab badge on it.

32:43.035 --> 32:47.625
If you want a convertible
Vauxhall Vectra, there you are.

32:47.625 --> 32:50.175
I can't think why.

32:50.175 --> 32:52.065
Now...

32:52.065 --> 32:58.425
for people who say,
"You only like expensive cars, "
yes, the Lamborghini Gallardo!

32:58.425 --> 33:05.115
This has got a V10, 5-litre engine.
I'll have to go to the loo
if I say that again.

33:05.115 --> 33:08.065
500bhp, fantastic-looking thing,

33:08.065 --> 33:11.115
on sale in Britain later this year.

33:11.115 --> 33:15.625
Prices are anticipated
to be around £120,000,

33:15.625 --> 33:20.265
so it will be competing
with the Ferrari 360.

33:20.265 --> 33:24.875
And actually, if its big brother,
the Murcielago,

33:24.875 --> 33:29.565
is anything to go by,
that will be

33:29.565 --> 33:32.075
a stonking good car.

33:32.075 --> 33:37.085
There's going to be a problem with
that. We've had this mystery fax.

33:37.085 --> 33:41.825
It came to the office - some
telephone numbers and a picture.

33:41.825 --> 33:44.905
Yes. What you would say that was?

33:44.905 --> 33:49.725
A Lotus Esprit.
Anybody else? Lotus Esprit, yeah?

33:49.725 --> 33:54.775
Now, this has actually come from
the manufacturer. Lotus? Lotus.

33:54.775 --> 33:57.365
When you ring the number,

33:57.365 --> 34:02.015
they will say, "What's that
picture? " "The Lotus Esprit. "

34:02.015 --> 34:07.595
They want to prove this is their
shape so they can copyright it.

34:07.595 --> 34:12.364
How can they do that?
Well, we can ensure they don't.

34:12.364 --> 34:15.614
If you get one of these, ring up

34:15.614 --> 34:20.335
and when they say, "What's that
picture? ", say, "Double Gloucester. "

34:20.335 --> 34:26.005
That way, every time somebody
buys a Ferrari or a Lotus or a...

34:26.005 --> 34:31.855
What was the...? A Lamborghini.
Or a Seat if they get round to it.

34:31.855 --> 34:37.695
More money for Britain's beleagured
cheese-makers. Good. Good point.

34:37.695 --> 34:39.764
Yeah.

34:39.764 --> 34:44.975
A quick question for you - how much
do you reckon this F355 is worth?

34:44.975 --> 34:50.014
What do you reckon?
80, 90, 60, 40? None of those.

34:50.014 --> 34:53.054
It's worth about 20 grand.

34:53.054 --> 34:57.975
This is our cheap thrills show -
this isn't a Ferrari.

34:57.975 --> 35:05.015
This is a Toyota MR2
that's been made to look
almost exactly like a F355.

35:05.015 --> 35:11.655
The bloke who built this,
once he'd turned his Toyota MR2
into a Ferrari replica,

35:11.655 --> 35:14.335
rang his insurance company.

35:14.335 --> 35:21.535
"Well, " they said, "it's now
classed as a kit car. " His
premium went from £1,200 to £300.

35:21.535 --> 35:28.335
A cheap thrill. There's a problem,
and it links back to what James
said about copyrighting cheese.

35:28.335 --> 35:33.375
Ferrari won't be too pleased
about somebody copying their shape.

35:33.375 --> 35:38.215
In fact, they'll probably
go after the bloke who built it.

35:38.215 --> 35:43.255
So, he's disappeared, he's escaped
to the Midlands underground.

35:43.255 --> 35:48.275
Wanted by the Italians, he still
survives as a soldier of fortune.

35:48.275 --> 35:52.295
But if you want one,
if you need his help,

35:52.295 --> 35:57.301
and if you can find him,
maybe you can buy this replica.

36:00.635 --> 36:06.265
For this programme I was asked to
find a fun car for not much money.

36:06.265 --> 36:09.280
And I failed...completely.

36:20.425 --> 36:23.695
This is the Bowler Wildcat.
Nice name.

36:23.695 --> 36:26.505
It's based on a Land Rover,

36:26.505 --> 36:31.435
but it has one key element missing
from normal Land Rovers - speed.

36:31.435 --> 36:37.035
An Aston Martin DB7 will go
from 0-60mph in 4. 9 seconds.

36:37.035 --> 36:40.505
This will do it in 4. 8.

36:47.805 --> 36:51.104
It does cost fifty grand.

36:54.765 --> 37:00.169
But everything's relative. This is
the best off-roader in the world.

37:03.845 --> 37:06.496
And it's road legal.

37:08.245 --> 37:14.165
So, how has a sheep-lugger from
Solihull become an off-road Ferrari?

37:14.165 --> 37:19.045
The Bowler Wildcats are built
by two brothers in Derbyshire.

37:19.045 --> 37:26.795
Instead of a heavy chassis, they
use a raised-car style space frame
that takes three weeks to weld.

37:26.795 --> 37:29.525
These body panels - fibreglass.

37:29.525 --> 37:34.555
The engine is a 5-litre,
300bhp Land Rover TVR hybrid V8.

37:34.555 --> 37:37.535
And the interior... Well...

37:39.205 --> 37:42.725
..there isn't one!
But, you know, you don't care.

37:42.725 --> 37:46.274
You just...don't.

37:55.965 --> 38:02.405
Fifty grand might sound
a lot of money for a car
that started life as a Land Rover.

38:02.405 --> 38:05.325
You can buy a BMW M5

38:05.325 --> 38:07.525
for that money.

38:07.525 --> 38:12.425
But think about it - a lot
of manufacturers claim to have

38:12.425 --> 38:15.025
a racing pedigree.

38:15.025 --> 38:21.505
But you couldn't turn up at Le Mans
in your M5... or your Ferrari,
for that matter,

38:21.505 --> 38:28.245
But you could buy a Wildcat and
the next day be on the start line
at the Paris-Dakar.

38:28.245 --> 38:30.915
Now, the scary bit.

38:30.915 --> 38:35.045
Straight on. Left. Ooh. Ow!
That hurt.

38:35.045 --> 38:40.405
The suspension is made by Bowler
and it is, of course,

38:40.405 --> 38:47.425
fully adjustable. The spec list
includes FIA-spec fuel tanks,

38:47.425 --> 38:50.585
an integrated fire extinguisher...

38:50.585 --> 38:53.215
and best of all,

38:53.215 --> 38:57.390
an onboard water supply
for desert racing. Ha-ha!

39:00.135 --> 39:03.285
The power from that...

39:03.285 --> 39:08.725
5-litre, half-TVR
half-Land Rover V8

39:08.725 --> 39:12.135
is just eating the world.

39:12.135 --> 39:14.755
It's incredible!

39:14.755 --> 39:18.054
This is...fast in a whole new way.

39:25.365 --> 39:29.175
This... I c... Ha-ha! Oh-ho!

39:29.175 --> 39:30.585
Oh, yes!

39:30.585 --> 39:32.665
Yes!

39:32.665 --> 39:38.165
Argh! How can anything survive
this... including me?!

39:38.165 --> 39:43.495
At this moment now, second...third!
Ah-ha-ha!

39:43.495 --> 39:46.145
What a feeling!

39:46.145 --> 39:51.287
I am a driving god!
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...!

39:56.155 --> 39:59.285
It's the most fun I've had in a car.

39:59.285 --> 40:03.875
But you can only do so much of it.
You haven't started yet!

40:03.875 --> 40:06.365
Thanks. That's Jim.

40:06.365 --> 40:10.975
He races this. He's raced
everything else. Now this.

40:10.975 --> 40:14.775
Oh, good! Think I'll put
my helmet on.

40:18.915 --> 40:21.975
I drove it fast,

40:21.975 --> 40:26.175
but Jim took it to another level.
This was an epic ride.

40:26.175 --> 40:30.695
Incredible. And most incredible
of all was

40:30.695 --> 40:34.055
how the machinery stood
this punishment.

40:34.055 --> 40:38.835
What does it do to your insides?
I dislodged a lung in Italy.

40:38.835 --> 40:41.645
Dislodged a lung?!

40:49.325 --> 40:52.395
Of course, they tested the Bowl.

40:52.395 --> 40:58.095
In computer simulations,
it simply outpaced the computer.

40:58.095 --> 41:02.015
After a 40ft drop onto its nose
in the desert,

41:02.015 --> 41:04.755
nothing, nothing happened.

41:04.755 --> 41:10.155
If you stood ten tonne weights on
its roof, nothing would happen.

41:10.155 --> 41:14.000
Nothing at all.

41:15.955 --> 41:19.395
Do you know,
it's not just a cheap thrill.

41:19.395 --> 41:24.055
At £50,000, it's a bargain
because it really is a supercar.

41:24.055 --> 41:29.095
More than that, it's a supercar
that's virtually indestructible.

41:38.302 --> 41:41.472
ALL: Yes!
And a brilliant car as well.

41:41.472 --> 41:44.852
There's one bit I want to see again.
May we?

41:44.852 --> 41:49.983
What a feeling!
Ah, I'm a driving god!

41:50.672 --> 41:54.051
I am a driving god!

41:55.712 --> 42:01.542
What, if you take a dog for a walk,
"I am a dog-walking god!"

42:01.542 --> 42:06.712
It was a big moment. It's like
being in a cartoon in that thing.

42:06.712 --> 42:13.332
Yes... You got carried away.
I got very carried away. I'm not
a driving god, it was a mistake.

42:13.332 --> 42:18.092
But I do know someone
who is a driving god.

42:18.092 --> 42:23.032
To find out how the Bowler would
do on the Top Gear test track,

42:23.032 --> 42:26.932
please welcome His Holiness,
the Stig.

42:26.932 --> 42:31.832
So it's off the line with
a bit of wheel spin there.

42:31.832 --> 42:36.405
This does 0-60 in 4. 8 seconds.
Wonder what the Stig's listening to?

42:37.952 --> 42:41.592
# Stand by your man... #
Oh, my word.

42:41.592 --> 42:46.992
It doesn't get much worse than that.
That is grizzling.

42:46.992 --> 42:51.092
By the looks of it there,
he's lost it!

42:51.092 --> 42:56.252
No, he's kept it all together.
Just listen to that V8.

42:56.252 --> 43:01.532
Clearly the Stig isn't there.
There's a bit of body roll there.

43:01.532 --> 43:06.452
The Stig is really pushing
this thing as hard as it will go.

43:06.452 --> 43:10.732
The test, he'll be coming up
to the follow through.

43:10.732 --> 43:13.932
Will the Bowler roll?
It looks solid.

43:13.932 --> 43:17.532
Very little body roll,
300 horsepower now,

43:17.532 --> 43:22.092
belting out onto the straight,
two bends to go now.

43:22.092 --> 43:25.332
Ooh, my word, that is on the edge!

43:25.332 --> 43:31.332
Gambon Corner ahead. He's gone
off-road. He crosses the line in...

43:31.332 --> 43:36.072
one minute, 39.4.

43:36.072 --> 43:41.532
There you go... Hold on a second!
It's not hard to be a driving god

43:41.532 --> 43:44.332
in a car that slow!

43:44.332 --> 43:50.052
Now look, for a car like that...
That £50,000 car.

43:50.052 --> 43:53.132
.. I think that is pretty impressive.

43:53.132 --> 44:00.662
I'll grant you it is impressive.
It's in the script I should argue
but I won't because I love that car.

44:00.662 --> 44:03.252
That's it for this evening. No.

44:03.252 --> 44:07.942
It's not... It seems
the driving god has more to say.

44:07.942 --> 44:12.132
What is it, driving god?
Things I wish I'd never said.

44:12.132 --> 44:15.642
Earlier on,
I toasted that Nissan Sunny.

44:15.642 --> 44:21.902
While we had the Jet dragster,
it was a shame to burn
just one thing I hate.

44:21.902 --> 44:24.632
LAUGHTER

44:48.492 --> 44:51.211
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

44:54.632 --> 44:58.462
So, have you got anything else
to burn?

44:58.462 --> 45:00.762
No, that's it. OK, we can end.

45:00.762 --> 45:01.956
Good night.
