01:12.687 --> 01:15.997
Well, it was here... someplace.

01:16.047 --> 01:19.005
But we've already been past here.

01:21.007 --> 01:23.805
The trees have grown so big.

01:25.607 --> 01:28.565
It's been so long
since my last visit.

01:35.407 --> 01:37.682
(Girl) Come on, Blaze.

01:37.727 --> 01:41.197
Grandma, when was
the last time you were here?

01:41.247 --> 01:43.636
(Chuckles) Years and years ago.

01:43.687 --> 01:47.282
Way before you were born, sweetheart.

01:47.327 --> 01:50.842
- (Blaze barking)
- Oh, look! Blaze found a squirrel.

01:50.887 --> 01:55.005
Now, just a minute.
I'm trying to get my bearings.

01:55.047 --> 01:57.766
Oh, there are so many paths here.

01:57.807 --> 02:01.197
So easy to get turned around.
Come on, darling.

02:01.247 --> 02:04.557
Grandma,
we're in the middle of nowhere!

02:04.607 --> 02:07.440
We're right in the middle
of New York City!

02:07.487 --> 02:10.320
You'll make yourself tired
walking so long.

02:10.366 --> 02:14.121
Nonsense. It hasn't been
more than a quarter of an hour.

02:15.207 --> 02:16.606
Not much further.

02:16.647 --> 02:18.524
Blaze is getting tired.

02:18.567 --> 02:20.364
Oh, I see!

02:23.207 --> 02:26.085
Grandma,
what are we looking for anyway?

02:26.127 --> 02:28.083
Uh, a memorial.

02:28.127 --> 02:30.482
- A me...- what?
- (Chuckles)

02:30.527 --> 02:34.281
A reminder of a wonderful story...

02:34.327 --> 02:37.399
and a place very far away from here.

02:37.447 --> 02:39.403
What place is that, Grandma?

02:41.047 --> 02:43.481
Nome, Alaska.

02:43.527 --> 02:47.042
It's a small town
almost on top of the world.

02:47.087 --> 02:48.566
Hmm.

02:48.607 --> 02:52.043
Now, that really was
in the middle of nowhere, sweetheart.

02:53.407 --> 02:58.162
In the cold winter of 1925,

02:58.207 --> 03:00.596
it was snowing hard.

03:02.607 --> 03:06.680
<i>Back then, the fastest and most
reliable way of getting around</i>

03:06.727 --> 03:10.515
<i>was with teams of dogs
pulling along sleds.</i>

03:10.567 --> 03:15.436
<i>Races were held every year
to find out the best team.</i>

03:17.047 --> 03:20.483
<i>And the competition
was very fierce.</i>

03:21.767 --> 03:24.042
(Barking)

03:24.087 --> 03:26.078
(Man) Mush!

03:32.647 --> 03:34.763
(Man) Gee up, boy.

03:34.807 --> 03:36.923
Hup! Hup! Hyah!

03:39.087 --> 03:41.806
Giddap, Steele! Giddap, giddap!

03:55.767 --> 03:58.281
Steele! Whoa! Whoa!

04:00.847 --> 04:03.315
Steele, we're not gonna make it!

04:03.367 --> 04:05.801
Hyah!

04:05.847 --> 04:10.318
- (1st man) Easy, now! Easy!
- (2nd man) Steele, hold back!

04:17.487 --> 04:20.047
(Dogs yelping)

04:20.087 --> 04:22.282
(Steele panting, dogs barking)

04:24.527 --> 04:26.643
Ohh! Steele!

04:26.687 --> 04:29.121
(1st man) Get in line, Steele!

04:29.167 --> 04:30.885
Get in line!

04:32.767 --> 04:35.759
Mush! Mush!

04:37.287 --> 04:40.438
It's the three-mile marker.

04:40.487 --> 04:44.241
(Russian accent) Balto,
get your slobbering mouth off me!

04:44.287 --> 04:47.324
Let's go, Boris.
We'll go catch the end of the race.

04:47.367 --> 04:51.076
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I'm a delicate country bird.

04:52.247 --> 04:54.238
I hate going into town.

04:54.287 --> 04:57.677
Ah, come on.
What's the worst that can happen?

04:57.727 --> 04:59.797
(Boris yelling)

04:59.847 --> 05:01.121
Whoa!

05:01.167 --> 05:02.486
(Spluttering)

05:02.527 --> 05:04.961
Please! Aah!

05:06.207 --> 05:08.801
Why do I let you talk me
into these things?

05:13.207 --> 05:15.084
Uh? Arggghhh!

05:17.687 --> 05:19.245
- Gurr!
- (Man) Huh?

05:19.287 --> 05:22.199
What the...?! Eeeh!

05:27.447 --> 05:29.358
Arrrgggghhh!

05:31.087 --> 05:33.157
(Boris) Whoa-ho!

05:33.207 --> 05:36.119
Bring that back, you thief!

05:39.447 --> 05:42.325
You are putting me down now?

05:42.367 --> 05:45.643
- Mr Golden Retriever?
- Whatever you say, Boris.

05:45.687 --> 05:49.157
Every time there's a race,
you run around like you're in it.

05:49.207 --> 05:51.596
- Maybe one day I will be.
- Heel, boy!

05:51.647 --> 05:54.320
Boris Goosinoff is no spring chicken.

05:54.367 --> 05:56.358
- Hey!
- (Crashing Sounds)

05:58.247 --> 06:00.715
I'm no spring penguin, either!

06:00.767 --> 06:03.759
Oy, it's cold! (Teeth chattering)

06:06.527 --> 06:08.563
(Man) Look! The two-mile mark.

06:08.607 --> 06:10.723
Come on! Don't wanna miss the finish.

06:10.767 --> 06:12.678
Oh, that would be a tragedy(!)

06:12.727 --> 06:14.479
Aaah!

06:14.527 --> 06:16.722
(Boris) I was being sarcastic.

06:19.287 --> 06:21.926
OK, you can open your eyes now.

06:23.207 --> 06:25.038
Ohh!

06:27.447 --> 06:30.996
I love these runners!
I love this brush bow!

06:31.047 --> 06:33.925
I love this sled!
Jenna, you're lead dog!

06:33.967 --> 06:36.925
OK, just a minute. Come on. Mush!

06:36.967 --> 06:38.958
Then you'll need... this.

06:39.007 --> 06:42.966
A real musher's hat!
We're a real sled team now!

06:43.007 --> 06:44.201
Mush!

06:44.247 --> 06:47.045
Mister Johanssen,
the sled is beautiful.

06:47.087 --> 06:49.726
- We're very grateful.
- Oh, thank you!

06:49.767 --> 06:52.565
- Rosy's grateful too, huh?
- So I gather!

06:52.607 --> 06:55.167
- Watch this!
- Coming, sweetheart.

06:55.207 --> 06:58.119
Maybe we should've gotten her
the doll house!

06:58.687 --> 07:00.723
It's the one-mile marker.

07:00.767 --> 07:03.725
Mush, Jenna, mush!
Let's win this race!

07:03.767 --> 07:07.043
- Whoo!
- I think she'll learn to like it!

07:08.487 --> 07:10.717
Jenna. Easy, girl.

07:10.767 --> 07:12.519
Whoa!

07:12.567 --> 07:17.322
Good morning, Jenna. Oughta be
a close race, don't you think?

07:17.367 --> 07:20.120
Maybe even neck and... neck.

07:20.167 --> 07:24.763
Say something about her new collar
before she gets whiplash.

07:24.807 --> 07:27.446
Um, Dixie, what a pretty collar.
Is it new?

07:27.487 --> 07:29.239
What? This old thing?

07:29.287 --> 07:33.280
Yeah. Do you think,
um, Steele will notice?

07:33.327 --> 07:37.366
The only way Steele notices anyone
is if they're wearing a mirror.

07:37.407 --> 07:39.477
(Man) They're comin'!

07:39.527 --> 07:42.439
(Cheering, dogs barking)

07:46.607 --> 07:49.679
- (Man) Steele!
- (Woman) You can do it!

07:49.727 --> 07:51.763
(Rosy) Jenna! Stay, girl!

07:51.807 --> 07:53.763
(Woman) That's some dog!

08:00.967 --> 08:02.719
(Rosy) Jenna!

08:06.807 --> 08:09.958
Hold on. Come on, Steele!

08:10.007 --> 08:11.884
Oh, no!

08:14.807 --> 08:16.365
(Gasps)

08:20.447 --> 08:21.926
My hat!

08:32.167 --> 08:35.523
- It's that stray dog!
- He's gonna ruin the race!

08:35.567 --> 08:37.284
Oww!

08:37.327 --> 08:38.442
Arrgghhh!

08:39.807 --> 08:42.640
Hey! Outta my way, lobo.

08:46.887 --> 08:48.366
Yii!

08:49.327 --> 08:51.557
(Panting and snarling)

08:59.327 --> 09:02.763
When will you learn
to stay on the sidelines?

09:08.927 --> 09:10.838
(Beeping)

09:10.887 --> 09:13.242
To Juneau Daily Chronicle. Stop.

09:13.287 --> 09:16.120
Steele wins first race
of season. Stop.

09:16.167 --> 09:20.240
Three-time winner keeps
Golden Collar. Stop. Nome. Stop.

09:20.287 --> 09:23.324
That Steele is some dog, huh, Morris?

09:23.367 --> 09:26.200
(Telegraph wire beeping rhythmically)

09:26.247 --> 09:28.807
Congratulations there, boss, there.

09:28.847 --> 09:31.361
It was a pleasure
runnin' behind youse.

09:31.407 --> 09:33.318
But the view got monotonous.

09:33.367 --> 09:36.723
You are the most amazing,
exalted, pre-eminent...

09:36.767 --> 09:38.359
You won!

09:40.207 --> 09:41.925
Hmm...

09:42.007 --> 09:45.317
I don't know.
You think Steele's losing his edge?

09:45.367 --> 09:48.200
Yeah, looks like just about any dog
could outrun him.

09:49.007 --> 09:51.316
- (Growling)
- Balto!

09:51.367 --> 09:55.883
What a crazy thing to do
just to show off to a pretty girl!

09:57.287 --> 10:00.245
I'm sure Jenna would love
to have you on her team.

10:00.287 --> 10:02.847
- Hey! Rosy! Stay away from him!
- Dad!

10:02.887 --> 10:06.084
He might bite you, honey.
He's part wolf.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.766
Now you've hurt his feelings.

10:08.807 --> 10:11.480
- (Steele chuckling)
- (Dad) Come on now.

10:11.527 --> 10:14.041
Congratulations, Steele.

10:14.087 --> 10:16.317
- Oooh!
- (Steele) Ladies.

10:19.047 --> 10:21.800
- Hi, there, Jenna. Enjoy the race?
- Yeah.

10:21.847 --> 10:24.680
- Almost as much as you did.
- Thanks.

10:24.727 --> 10:28.356
Jenna, let's go celebrate. I know
where all the bones are buried.

10:28.407 --> 10:31.797
I don't know.
Suddenly, I've lost my appetite.

10:31.847 --> 10:33.803
Oh!

10:33.847 --> 10:38.682
Well, maybe your taste
runs more toward... wolf.

10:38.727 --> 10:41.719
Jenna! Come on, girl.
We're going back home.

10:41.767 --> 10:44.486
Sorry, Steele.
My girl is calling me.

10:44.527 --> 10:46.882
On the other hand,

10:46.927 --> 10:50.283
my girl is away
at boarding school.

10:50.327 --> 10:52.363
(Steele yawns and burps)

10:52.407 --> 10:54.841
Whoo... ohh! Oh.

11:02.167 --> 11:05.079
Er... Uh... Mmm.

11:05.127 --> 11:06.924
(Rosy) Jenna!

11:06.967 --> 11:09.959
- Huh?
- Jenna!

11:12.047 --> 11:13.924
Ooh!

11:13.967 --> 11:16.003
(Nervous laugh)

11:16.047 --> 11:19.198
Jenna, I, uh...

11:19.247 --> 11:21.841
- Jenna.
- Jen! Come on!

11:30.887 --> 11:33.401
(Dad) Jenna! Come here, girl.

11:33.447 --> 11:35.199
(Sighs)

11:36.327 --> 11:40.036
Balto, there's some things
I can't do for you.

11:40.087 --> 11:41.440
Yeah.

11:41.487 --> 11:43.318
I'm goose, not Cupid.

11:43.367 --> 11:45.722
Didn't make the team... Bingo?

11:45.767 --> 11:48.520
Don't listen to him or look at him.
Live a long life.

11:48.567 --> 11:50.398
My name's Balto.

11:50.447 --> 11:52.517
But you can call him "idiot"!

11:52.567 --> 11:54.956
I'm sorry. Balto.
Balto the half-breed.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.486
(Other dogs mocking)

11:56.527 --> 11:58.802
Hey, goose,
you a half-breed too, huh?

11:58.847 --> 12:01.759
- Part turkey?
- Waa-hah-hah!

12:01.807 --> 12:03.525
Good wordplay there, boss.

12:03.607 --> 12:05.598
You are the wittiest, the quickest.

12:05.647 --> 12:09.401
You are the drollest,
the cleverest, the most hilarious...

12:09.447 --> 12:11.199
You crack me up!

12:12.527 --> 12:15.963
Ah-ha-ha-haaa! Whoo!

12:16.007 --> 12:18.760
Steele. Just leave him out of this.

12:18.807 --> 12:22.925
Oh, Balto, I've got a message
for your mother.

12:22.967 --> 12:25.401
- (Steele howls)
- (Dogs laughing)

12:29.127 --> 12:31.038
- (All laughing)
- Hi, Mom!

12:31.087 --> 12:34.602
Balto, translate this for me...
(Howls)

12:34.647 --> 12:37.002
What's wolf for "Go chase your tail"?

12:37.047 --> 12:38.446
Balto, stop! Whoa!

12:38.487 --> 12:41.240
- (Growling)
- (Howling continues)

12:41.287 --> 12:43.084
- Uh-oh.
- (Growling)

12:43.127 --> 12:45.083
Get him.

12:46.567 --> 12:50.003
Get out of here, wolf-dog.
Get back to your pack!

12:50.047 --> 12:54.837
Maybe it's the unrelenting fear,
but I'm seeing wisdom in this advice.

12:54.887 --> 12:56.718
Maybe we go now, huh? Now!

12:56.767 --> 13:01.602
I'm thinking Balto's friend
got his feathers ruffled!

13:01.647 --> 13:03.478
Goose! Ha! I get it!

13:06.727 --> 13:09.446
Half-wolf in the side pocket there.

13:09.487 --> 13:13.321
That was the most dead centre,
on-target, down-the-middle...

13:13.367 --> 13:15.198
Ya hit him!

13:16.287 --> 13:19.359
(Sighs, gulps)

13:19.407 --> 13:21.477
(Evil chuckling)

13:21.527 --> 13:23.245
That son-of-a...

13:23.287 --> 13:27.917
He is the most malicious, disgusting,
obnoxious, revolting, repulsive...

13:27.967 --> 13:29.605
He's no lap dog.

13:31.007 --> 13:32.838
(Giggles)

13:33.847 --> 13:35.803
Aah! Ooh.

13:49.327 --> 13:52.160
(Howling)

13:52.207 --> 13:54.767
Hmm.

14:06.087 --> 14:09.079
(Boris) Not a dog, not a wolf.

14:09.127 --> 14:12.597
All he knows is what he is not.

14:12.647 --> 14:15.844
If only he could see what he is.

14:15.887 --> 14:18.355
Oy, oy.

14:44.327 --> 14:46.124
(Squeaking)

14:46.167 --> 14:47.998
Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!

14:48.407 --> 14:50.398
(Thud, squeaking stops)

14:58.367 --> 15:00.323
(€ Russian dance)
Hey!

15:01.367 --> 15:02.766
Hey!

15:04.087 --> 15:05.918
Hey! (Music stops)

15:18.447 --> 15:20.438
(Honking)

15:22.487 --> 15:24.876
Homesick, Boris?

15:24.927 --> 15:28.840
- You ever think about going back?
- Don't fret, Fido.

15:28.887 --> 15:32.482
I'm sticking here until I'm sure
you can stand on own four feet.

15:32.527 --> 15:35.803
- YOU'RE taking care of ME?!
- Don't thank me.

15:37.167 --> 15:39.522
I smell... herring.

15:39.567 --> 15:42.764
- The herring are flying south too?
- Say!

15:42.807 --> 15:45.526
- Must be Muk and Luk.
- Oh. Good news(!)

15:45.567 --> 15:48.684
- Uncle Boris!
- Oh, no!

15:48.727 --> 15:51.605
How sweet. "Uncle Boris."

15:51.647 --> 15:53.444
No hugging, no licking!

15:54.887 --> 15:57.447
- Uncle Boris!
- Aaaah!

15:57.487 --> 16:00.001
Aaah. Ooh!

16:01.527 --> 16:03.279
Whew.

16:03.327 --> 16:04.601
Oh, no.

16:04.647 --> 16:08.276
(Muk) He says he's glad to see you.

16:08.327 --> 16:10.045
We love you, Uncle Boris.

16:11.287 --> 16:13.005
Aaah! Ooh-hoo-hoo!

16:13.047 --> 16:15.845
(Whimpering)

16:15.887 --> 16:17.286
(Mutters)

16:21.727 --> 16:23.524
(Humming)

16:23.567 --> 16:25.444
Hmm?

16:25.487 --> 16:28.160
(Continues whimpering)

16:29.687 --> 16:32.360
What?! Of course he's glad to see us.

16:32.407 --> 16:36.036
He loves us... don't you?

16:36.087 --> 16:38.237
Oy. OK, OK.

16:38.287 --> 16:41.802
Hey, boychicks, uh, let's play a game.

16:41.847 --> 16:43.565
Yes, please, Uncle Boris.

16:43.607 --> 16:45.802
Race you to the shore.
One, two, three, go!

16:45.847 --> 16:47.678
(Laughing) Yeah!

16:47.727 --> 16:49.638
- They win.
- (Splashing)

16:49.687 --> 16:52.724
(Muk) Help! Help! We can't swim!

16:54.127 --> 16:57.437
Help! Help! We're drowning!
Save us, please!

16:57.487 --> 16:58.806
Bears!

16:58.847 --> 17:03.363
- Fellas! Idiot balls of fluff!
- Easy, Boris. You know how they are.

17:03.407 --> 17:04.964
Muk! Luk!

17:05.007 --> 17:08.238
Relax! Come on, you're OK.
You're not drowning.

17:08.287 --> 17:09.925
Huh?

17:09.967 --> 17:13.242
He has point, bears.
You are not drowning.

17:13.287 --> 17:16.597
If you will pause one moment
you will observe...

17:16.646 --> 17:18.523
tide is out!

17:20.567 --> 17:22.522
(Whimpers)

17:22.567 --> 17:24.522
He said what?

17:24.567 --> 17:28.355
Oh, the shame of the polar bear
who fears the water.

17:28.406 --> 17:32.480
No wonder we are shunned
by our fellow bear. Woe is us!

17:32.527 --> 17:35.519
It's what he said.
Kind of pathetic, really.

17:35.567 --> 17:38.923
- (Luk whimpers)
- What, more whimpering?

17:38.967 --> 17:43.404
Between you and Balto, it's like
Dostoevsky novel here. Lighten up.

17:49.047 --> 17:51.038
And what is so interesting?

17:52.247 --> 17:55.080
- Jenna.
- Is love.

17:55.127 --> 17:57.561
So go make move.

17:57.607 --> 18:03.045
When the angels' balalaikas
strum the sweet song of love, mambo!

18:03.087 --> 18:05.476
Nah. She's not my type.

18:05.527 --> 18:08.121
And why not?
This wolf business again?

18:08.167 --> 18:11.477
What's wrong with being half
and half, I'd like to know?

18:11.527 --> 18:13.802
Sometimes I wish I was half eagle.

18:13.847 --> 18:14.996
Why?

18:15.047 --> 18:17.322
Better profile, for one thing. Hmm.

18:17.367 --> 18:19.517
And no one eats you, for another.

18:23.527 --> 18:25.802
(Coughs)

18:25.847 --> 18:28.315
- (Jenna barking)
- Jenna?

18:29.687 --> 18:31.723
- (Barking continues)
- Jenna!

18:31.767 --> 18:34.520
Jenna! Hi, girl!

18:44.087 --> 18:48.000
Rosy! Rosy, come on. You're gonna
catch your death out here.

18:48.047 --> 18:51.119
- OK, Dad.
- Come on, the doctor's waiting.

19:06.447 --> 19:08.836
(Rosy coughing)

19:32.847 --> 19:33.836
Jenna?

19:33.887 --> 19:36.447
(Clears throat, lowers voice) Jenna.

19:36.487 --> 19:38.557
Balto. Hi.

19:38.607 --> 19:40.598
Hi.

19:40.647 --> 19:43.559
Look, uh...

19:43.607 --> 19:46.644
Just a shot in the dark,
but I was wondering if...

19:46.687 --> 19:51.761
I don't know, maybe you'd like to
go chase a few sticks by moonlight.

19:51.807 --> 19:54.480
(Chuckles, sighs)

19:58.927 --> 20:00.440
Jenna?

20:00.487 --> 20:04.036
- Rosy's in there.
- In a hospital? Why?

20:04.967 --> 20:07.925
She feels warm
and she has a terrible cough.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.163
Balto, what's wrong with her?

20:13.207 --> 20:18.281
Uh, I'm not sure,
but I know how to find out. Come on.

20:20.647 --> 20:22.763
I have the keys to the city.

20:28.847 --> 20:30.565
After you.

20:32.207 --> 20:34.562
- Balto!
- (Laughs)

20:34.607 --> 20:37.599
Big paws kinda run in my family.

20:37.647 --> 20:40.320
At least, uh, one side of my family.

20:43.167 --> 20:47.399
- Stay close.
- (Nervous laugh) No problem there.

20:51.647 --> 20:54.320
It's so gloomy down here.

20:54.367 --> 20:56.323
Not that I'm scared or anything.

20:57.647 --> 21:02.198
Gloomy? You kiddin'? It's the
most beautiful spot in the world.

21:02.247 --> 21:05.398
Dogs travel for years
just to be right here.

21:05.447 --> 21:08.439
Here? I can't see why.

21:08.487 --> 21:12.605
That's cos you're looking
at the bowl half empty.

21:12.647 --> 21:15.923
See this? It's the polar ice caps.

21:15.967 --> 21:18.527
Balto, those are broken bottles.

21:18.567 --> 21:21.764
And they're not half empty,
they're all empty.

21:21.847 --> 21:24.361
- The sun.
- Oh, Balto...

21:24.407 --> 21:27.683
And... to the north...

21:30.647 --> 21:33.923
(Jenna) The northern lights!

21:33.967 --> 21:36.561
Oh!

21:36.607 --> 21:39.041
Oh, Balto, you're right.

21:39.087 --> 21:41.760
It's beautiful.

21:43.007 --> 21:45.123
Yeah.

21:45.167 --> 21:47.044
Beautiful.

21:49.527 --> 21:51.836
(Footsteps)

21:53.847 --> 21:57.760
(Doctor) Good night, Rosy.
(Rosy) I'm so cold.

21:57.807 --> 22:02.278
I have another blanket for you here.
Stay warm and get some rest.

22:08.367 --> 22:10.562
Doctor, how is she?

22:10.607 --> 22:14.077
Exhausted from coughing.
Her fever's getting worse.

22:14.127 --> 22:17.119
(Doctor) Looks like diphtheria.

22:17.167 --> 22:20.477
She's the 18th case this week.

22:22.127 --> 22:25.915
And I'm out of antitoxin.

22:25.967 --> 22:27.685
(Jenna trembling)

22:27.727 --> 22:29.638
Jenna. Jenna, I'm sorry.

22:29.687 --> 22:33.157
Jenna, I...
I didn't mean to upset you.

22:33.207 --> 22:36.836
- I shouldn't have taken you there.
- No, I'm glad you did.

22:36.887 --> 22:38.878
(Crashing)

22:38.927 --> 22:40.724
Steele.

22:42.167 --> 22:43.361
Well, well.

22:43.407 --> 22:47.366
What's wrong with this picture?
Jenna, join me for dinner.

22:47.407 --> 22:50.319
You start at one end,
I'll start at the other.

22:50.367 --> 22:53.359
When we get to the middle,
well... (Chuckles)

22:53.407 --> 22:55.762
- You tell me.
- All right, Steele.

22:55.807 --> 22:57.798
- No, Balto.
- (Barks weakly)

22:57.847 --> 23:00.407
(Jenna and Steele laughing)

23:01.727 --> 23:04.958
- Gee, Steele...
- (Fire roaring)

23:05.007 --> 23:07.999
...I have to admit your offer
is very tempting.

23:08.047 --> 23:10.356
It is. (Chuckling)

23:11.447 --> 23:14.883
But these days I prefer my meat...
cooked.

23:17.567 --> 23:20.923
- (Howling)
- Come on, let's go!

23:22.807 --> 23:24.877
(Man) What's all the noise?

23:24.927 --> 23:28.476
- I think it's over here.
- (Balto) Jenna, come on.

23:36.207 --> 23:38.437
Looks like Balto's found your meat.

23:38.487 --> 23:42.196
Good thing Steele was here.
Good boy, you've earned these.

23:42.247 --> 23:46.206
Besides, I can't use 'em after
that wild animal's touched 'em.

23:46.247 --> 23:50.604
Go on, get out of here, you thief!
Come on, Jenna, let's go home.

23:55.607 --> 23:57.757
(Telegraph wire beeping)

23:57.807 --> 24:00.560
Anchorage. Stop.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.723
Repeat, urgent request.

24:02.767 --> 24:06.442
More diphtheria antitoxin. Stop.

24:06.487 --> 24:09.604
Nome in grave danger. Stop.

24:09.647 --> 24:12.320
Please help. Stop.

24:25.247 --> 24:28.637
(Telegraph operator)
<i>Nome, pack ice closing in.</i>

24:28.687 --> 24:32.919
<i>Cannot ship antitoxin by sea.</i>

24:32.967 --> 24:35.800
<i>Will try by air.</i>

24:42.207 --> 24:45.085
<i>Nome, storm at airport.</i>

24:45.127 --> 24:49.598
<i>Planes grounded until storm clears.</i>

24:49.687 --> 24:51.803
<i>Many regrets.</i>

24:51.847 --> 24:54.884
<i>From Juneau, Office of the Governor,</i>

24:54.927 --> 24:59.045
<i>we are shipping antitoxin by rail.
Stop.</i>

24:59.087 --> 25:01.601
<i>Train line ends at town of Nenana.</i>

25:01.647 --> 25:04.161
<i>Select fastest dogs for sled team.</i>

25:04.207 --> 25:08.405
<i>To carry antitoxin
from Nenana to Nome. Stop.</i>

25:08.447 --> 25:12.599
<i>God willing,
train will make it through. Stop.</i>

25:14.447 --> 25:19.157
(Man) ...select the fastest dogs for
the sled team to fetch the antitoxin,

25:19.207 --> 25:22.199
the race is from...
(Becomes indistinct)

25:25.927 --> 25:30.159
Just look at him.
He's gonna save the entire town.

25:30.207 --> 25:33.643
He's positively... magnesium!

25:33.687 --> 25:36.645
It's not exactly
a one-dog show, Dixie.

25:36.687 --> 25:39.679
They're racing
to be on the dog sled team.

25:39.727 --> 25:42.958
What's with you, Jenna?
Steele's a genuine hero.

25:43.007 --> 25:45.237
But do you give him a sniff?

25:45.287 --> 25:48.962
That's because Jenna
is running with Balto.

25:49.007 --> 25:53.364
She was seen in the boiler room
the other night with Balto.

25:53.407 --> 25:56.604
They went in together
and they left together.

25:56.647 --> 25:59.525
I heard it all from
a very reliable source.

25:59.567 --> 26:01.444
And don't bother to deny it.

26:01.487 --> 26:03.523
Well, then I won't.

26:03.567 --> 26:06.400
Oh! I'm speechless.

26:06.447 --> 26:09.405
All mushers, get your dogs ready!

26:09.447 --> 26:12.644
- The race is about to begin!
- Wait! Balto!

26:12.687 --> 26:16.999
Racing is a spectator sport.
It requires very little preparation.

26:17.047 --> 26:19.038
Aaahh! Whew!

26:19.087 --> 26:21.681
You sit, you arrange refreshments.

26:21.727 --> 26:23.604
You like potato chip?

26:26.007 --> 26:28.805
I'm not watching the race,
I'm running it.

26:30.287 --> 26:33.836
- You said what?
- Look, I wanna help Rosy get better.

26:33.887 --> 26:35.957
I can get that medicine through.

26:36.007 --> 26:37.838
First... First...

26:37.887 --> 26:42.722
They wouldn't put you in a sled team
if you did win, which won't happen.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.725
- And if it did, it wouldn't matter.
- Boris,

26:45.767 --> 26:49.601
did you ever think maybe you're
the reason the other geese fly south?

26:49.647 --> 26:52.525
If only your feet
were as fast as your mouth.

26:52.567 --> 26:55.286
- (Man) Dogs to the line!
- They're starting.

26:55.327 --> 26:57.283
- Wish me luck.
- Luck?

26:57.327 --> 27:01.559
I don't wish you luck,
I wish you sense!

27:03.087 --> 27:05.078
Good luck, kiddo.

27:05.127 --> 27:07.083
Balto? What are you, nuts?

27:07.127 --> 27:10.563
Steele catches you here,
he'll turn you into kibble!

27:10.607 --> 27:14.441
Let the half-dog run. It will be fun
making him eat our snow.

27:14.487 --> 27:16.398
Get set.

27:16.447 --> 27:19.245
- Balto?
- What does he think he's doing?

27:19.287 --> 27:22.916
(Both panting and grunting)

27:22.967 --> 27:24.082
(Growls)

27:24.127 --> 27:26.561
Oh, Balto, come on, come on!

27:26.607 --> 27:28.882
Balto, go!

27:32.247 --> 27:34.886
- Ohhh!
- (Evil laughing)

27:34.927 --> 27:36.838
Hey! That's a foul!

27:36.887 --> 27:40.163
Where's the referee? Is he blind?

27:43.207 --> 27:46.165
(Boris)
Go, Balto, go! Jump, jump, jump!

27:46.207 --> 27:48.846
Hey! That's my boy!

27:48.887 --> 27:50.798
Go, Balto!

27:53.607 --> 27:56.167
(Boris) Balto, where are you going?

27:56.207 --> 28:00.519
That's the long way...
Balto, get back in the race!

28:06.727 --> 28:08.240
- Huh?
- Sorry!

28:09.807 --> 28:12.401
Who's eating whose snow now, mutt?

28:12.447 --> 28:14.756
(Cheering)

28:15.807 --> 28:17.559
Time!

28:17.607 --> 28:19.837
- What?!
- Ho-ho-ho!

28:19.887 --> 28:23.436
Did I teach him well?.
I could kiss that crazy pooch.

28:30.167 --> 28:33.477
Nikki, Kaltag, Star, move it.
We're strapping up.

28:33.527 --> 28:35.995
Hey, now, just a second here, Steele.

28:36.047 --> 28:38.117
I was the fastest dog.

28:38.167 --> 28:41.603
You were the fastest... what?

28:41.647 --> 28:45.276
Do you honestly think any musher
would put you on his team?

28:45.327 --> 28:48.205
- You're really mixed-up!
- Steele!

28:48.247 --> 28:52.479
It doesn't matter who's on the team
as long as the medicine gets through.

28:52.527 --> 28:54.518
Stop being such a glory hound.

28:54.567 --> 28:57.764
You're a hundred per cent right,
Jenna. I... I...

28:57.807 --> 29:00.196
I wasn't thinking about the children.

29:00.247 --> 29:04.877
The important thing is to get the
medicine, and that's what I'll do.

29:04.927 --> 29:08.317
And when I come back I'm gonna
fold you five ways...

29:08.367 --> 29:10.801
and leave you for a cat toy.

29:10.847 --> 29:13.236
(Man) Good dog, Steele.

29:13.287 --> 29:16.597
Good boy! Now, let's take a look
at our winner here.

29:16.647 --> 29:20.083
- Huh? (Growls)
- Let's take a look at our winner.

29:20.127 --> 29:22.357
Aaah!

29:22.407 --> 29:24.682
Ah, we can't trust this one.

29:24.727 --> 29:27.082
- He's part wolf.
- See those teeth?

29:27.127 --> 29:28.879
He might turn on me.

29:28.927 --> 29:32.124
Nikki, Kaltag, Star! Let's go!

29:32.207 --> 29:34.767
Hmph.

29:39.727 --> 29:43.037
- Balto, I'm sorry...
- Better not talk to me, Jenna.

29:43.087 --> 29:46.557
- I might turn on you.
- Balto, wait. Balto!

29:51.207 --> 29:54.916
As long as there's hope
for those kids, I'll keep this lit.

29:54.967 --> 29:56.798
It'll guide the team back.

29:56.847 --> 29:59.805
Easy, easy. Back, back.

30:02.287 --> 30:05.359
(Man) The sooner they leave,
the sooner they're back.

30:05.407 --> 30:09.116
(Musher) Stretch out, now.
Stretch out, Star.

30:09.167 --> 30:12.045
Steele! Hyah! Giddap! Hyah!

30:12.087 --> 30:15.796
(Cheering and whistling)

30:48.607 --> 30:50.598
(Whistle blows)

30:53.927 --> 30:55.804
Easy with that.

30:56.967 --> 31:00.243
All right, now make sure
you lash her down tight.

31:00.287 --> 31:02.278
Giddap, Steele! Giddap!

31:02.327 --> 31:05.160
- Mush!
- Take care now, y'hear?

31:05.207 --> 31:08.995
- Good luck!
- Go on, boys, go on! Move along.

31:14.407 --> 31:16.875
(Dogs straining and grunting)

31:21.927 --> 31:23.645
(Grunting) Come on.

31:24.967 --> 31:26.525
Steele!

31:26.567 --> 31:30.162
Maybe we should go back. We're lost!

31:30.207 --> 31:33.597
I am not lost!

31:33.647 --> 31:36.002
Lost? Heh-heh. Did I say lost?

31:36.047 --> 31:37.844
You didn't let me finish.

31:37.887 --> 31:40.355
- I wanted to say... Aaah!
- This way!

31:44.247 --> 31:46.397
(Telegraph wire beeping)

31:53.447 --> 31:55.244
(Barking)

31:55.287 --> 31:59.041
It's terrible, my friends.
Just terrible.

31:59.087 --> 32:02.921
Steele and his team... are lost.

32:02.967 --> 32:05.765
- No! Steele?
- What do you mean?

32:05.807 --> 32:08.401
- When?
- They missed the second checkpoint.

32:08.447 --> 32:10.563
They're off the trail.

32:10.607 --> 32:12.598
Can't they send another team?

32:12.647 --> 32:15.480
It's too dangerous
for us and our men.

32:15.527 --> 32:17.757
What about... them little ones?

32:17.807 --> 32:20.924
The medicine won't be here in time.

32:21.007 --> 32:23.441
We're going to lose them.

32:25.247 --> 32:27.477
Rosy.

32:27.527 --> 32:29.722
(Shivering, moaning)

32:31.287 --> 32:35.724
Please, Doctor,
it's the only medicine we got.

32:35.767 --> 32:37.917
OK.

32:54.567 --> 32:56.558
Jenna?

33:12.767 --> 33:14.917
(Hammering)

33:48.047 --> 33:49.480
Rosy.

33:54.207 --> 33:57.279
Balto, please.
Don't go crazy on me now.

33:59.047 --> 34:00.844
This is foolishness.

34:00.887 --> 34:04.004
You will die like a dog!
Oh, uh, no offence.

34:04.047 --> 34:05.162
Whoa!

34:07.727 --> 34:09.763
(Whimpers)

34:09.806 --> 34:12.639
(Boris) You will be frozen stiff
by morning!

34:14.487 --> 34:18.036
When you are big frozen-stiff
statue named Balto,

34:18.087 --> 34:20.203
don't come running to me!

34:20.246 --> 34:22.043
- Whoa!
- Hoo-hoo!

34:22.087 --> 34:24.362
- (Muk) He says...
- "Where is he going?"

34:24.407 --> 34:28.081
He's going into freezing coldness
to find a dog he doesn't like

34:28.127 --> 34:31.437
to bring medicine back to a town
that doesn't like him!

34:31.487 --> 34:34.239
Oh, no! I'm beginning
to understand the bear!

34:36.127 --> 34:38.357
Yes! Yes! Count us in!

34:38.447 --> 34:40.277
Bears! Dogs!

34:40.367 --> 34:43.040
(Muffled) Balto! Balto! Put me down!

34:47.087 --> 34:52.206
No brains at all! Might as well
be talking to hu... mans.

34:52.246 --> 34:54.123
(Shivering)

35:03.407 --> 35:06.205
So, let's go get the medicine.

35:06.247 --> 35:08.477
Wait a minute. Now you're coming?

35:08.527 --> 35:12.202
Spending days in bitter cold,
facing wild animals,

35:12.247 --> 35:14.283
risking death from exposure...

35:14.327 --> 35:17.524
is like holiday in old country.

35:19.567 --> 35:22.240
(Muk) Oh! Great!
We're goin' on holiday!

35:54.567 --> 35:56.523
Balto?

35:58.367 --> 36:00.517
Good, Balto!

36:00.567 --> 36:02.842
You took on the roughest, toughest,

36:02.887 --> 36:05.640
meanest tree in the forest...
and you won.

36:05.687 --> 36:08.042
- I'm marking the trail.
- Huh?

36:08.087 --> 36:11.159
He's marking our trail.
He's very clever.

36:12.807 --> 36:16.083
(Boris) And here
I've been dropping bread crumbs!

36:18.967 --> 36:21.765
(Muk) I spy with my little eye

36:21.807 --> 36:24.640
something beginning with "S".

36:40.407 --> 36:41.965
Steele.

36:47.167 --> 36:49.476
- Ohh.
- (Boris) Hey!

36:49.527 --> 36:51.245
Bears!

36:52.647 --> 36:54.160
Come on.

36:55.287 --> 36:57.562
Steele and his team passed this way.

36:57.607 --> 36:59.598
Boy, is he lost.

37:02.567 --> 37:04.398
(Musher) Go!

37:07.727 --> 37:09.558
Steele!

37:09.607 --> 37:11.598
We're going in circles!

37:11.647 --> 37:13.444
- What?
- Gaa-aaah!

37:13.487 --> 37:18.083
Circles is a good thing. I mean,
they're, uh... They're circular.

37:19.607 --> 37:21.563
I know what I'm doing! It's...

37:23.567 --> 37:26.035
It's... this way! Come on!

37:26.087 --> 37:27.918
Waa-aaah!

37:31.287 --> 37:34.882
(Musher) Whoa! Whoa, Steele!

37:45.967 --> 37:48.845
(Barking and yelping)

37:51.247 --> 37:53.966
(Groaning and yelping)

37:54.007 --> 37:56.521
Aaaah!

38:08.807 --> 38:11.162
Ohh! I hit my head on somethin'.

38:11.207 --> 38:13.084
Yeah. My head.

38:13.127 --> 38:15.163
Looks like he's hurt bad, Steele.

38:15.207 --> 38:17.767
W-What are we gonna do now, Steele?

38:17.807 --> 38:19.877
(Shivering and panting)

38:19.927 --> 38:22.600
(Wind howling)

38:34.327 --> 38:35.965
(Muk) Whoo! Yes!

38:36.007 --> 38:39.079
- (Luk whimpering)
- Ha ha! Whoo!

38:41.087 --> 38:43.999
Shh! Aah!

38:44.287 --> 38:47.484
Brilliant! Right on the beak!
What a bull's-eye!

38:49.887 --> 38:51.843
That did it! Who did that?

38:54.647 --> 38:57.764
- (Whimpers)
- I-It was him.

38:57.807 --> 38:59.923
(Luk whimpers)

38:59.967 --> 39:01.798
(Faint growling)

39:09.087 --> 39:10.998
Guys, I think...

39:11.047 --> 39:12.878
(Growling)

39:14.607 --> 39:16.802
I think we should keep moving.

39:16.887 --> 39:19.959
Is that your answer to all problems?
Motion?

39:20.007 --> 39:21.918
(Back creaks)

39:21.967 --> 39:23.798
(Honking)

39:23.847 --> 39:26.122
Yeah, yeah! It's good.

39:26.167 --> 39:28.044
Come on! Let's get going.

39:28.087 --> 39:30.885
"Come on, boys. Let's go, boys.
Faster, boys."

39:30.927 --> 39:33.202
Easy to say for a guy with four legs!

39:34.607 --> 39:37.519
OK, that's it.

39:37.567 --> 39:41.526
Is time for goose to
kick a little bear butt.

39:42.527 --> 39:44.597
Aha! Finally!

39:44.647 --> 39:48.640
Your old Uncle Boris
is making an impression!

39:48.687 --> 39:50.564
Now what?

39:52.927 --> 39:54.485
(Growling)

40:07.047 --> 40:08.526
Aaaah!

40:19.967 --> 40:21.241
Help!

40:25.887 --> 40:28.117
Aaaah!

40:37.047 --> 40:38.878
Aaaaah!

40:42.287 --> 40:44.437
Jenna?

40:51.407 --> 40:52.965
Aaah!

41:23.487 --> 41:26.320
Balto!

41:27.727 --> 41:30.560
(Ice cracking)

41:49.367 --> 41:50.686
Balto!

41:52.047 --> 41:54.322
- Aah-aaah!
- Balto!

41:55.327 --> 41:57.761
No!

42:00.727 --> 42:03.799
- (Muk) Geronimo!
- (Luk humming Cavalry Charge)

42:08.207 --> 42:10.084
Luk! Muk!

42:10.127 --> 42:12.004
They cannot swim!

42:12.047 --> 42:14.766
What? Polar bears who can't swim?

42:19.567 --> 42:21.717
(Blubbering)

42:29.527 --> 42:31.199
He's drowning!

42:32.407 --> 42:33.806
No!

42:35.367 --> 42:37.198
Well?

42:37.247 --> 42:39.636
Yaa-oww! I don't see them.

42:42.567 --> 42:44.398
Where are they?

42:45.647 --> 42:47.797
(Rumbling)

42:52.807 --> 42:54.604
- Balto!
- Muk! Luk!

42:56.047 --> 42:58.402
Balto!

43:07.167 --> 43:09.123
Come to life. Come to life.

43:09.167 --> 43:11.078
Breathe! Come on!

43:11.127 --> 43:14.244
Is he be OK? He's not breathing.
He doesn't look very well.

43:14.287 --> 43:16.278
Stop hitting him, Uncle Boris!

43:17.687 --> 43:21.157
Balto, I was so scared
I got people bumps.

43:23.487 --> 43:25.284
Boris...

43:26.407 --> 43:29.285
I know you think
this trip is crazy, but...

43:30.447 --> 43:32.244
I'm glad you came.

43:32.287 --> 43:36.041
Who else should you bring on a wild
goose chase but a goose, hmm?

43:36.087 --> 43:38.476
- Are you OK?
- Are you OK? Jen...

43:38.527 --> 43:42.884
I'm fine. A message came,
we have to take the mountain trail.

43:42.927 --> 43:46.237
But if we take Eagle Pass,
it'll save us half a day.

43:46.287 --> 43:50.360
It's blocked. The mountain trail
is dangerous, but we can do it.

43:50.407 --> 43:54.036
I'm beginning to see
there isn't anything you can't do.

43:54.087 --> 43:56.396
I'm seeing a few things too,

43:56.447 --> 43:58.563
and it's making the ice melt.

44:01.567 --> 44:04.081
I hate bears!

44:04.127 --> 44:07.756
You guys oughta learn how to swim.
You'd be very good at it.

44:08.967 --> 44:11.083
(Whimpering)

44:11.127 --> 44:15.040
0f course we were in the water!
We were moving, we got wet...

44:16.607 --> 44:19.883
Luk! We were swimming!

44:22.807 --> 44:24.638
Ohh! Clumsy.

44:24.727 --> 44:27.764
- No, you're not. You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

44:27.807 --> 44:29.604
Oww!

44:31.967 --> 44:34.162
Maybe I'm not so fine.

44:34.207 --> 44:37.040
- You should go ahead without me.
- Jenna...

44:37.087 --> 44:41.126
I'll be slowing everyone down.
Rosy can't hold out much longer.

44:43.367 --> 44:47.326
Muk, you and Luk carry
Jenna back to town on this.

44:47.367 --> 44:51.963
And this time don't take time out
for a swim!

44:52.007 --> 44:54.043
You can make sure of that, Boris.

44:54.087 --> 44:57.318
You're gonna lead them home.
Just follow my marks.

44:57.367 --> 45:00.484
- You're going alone?
- Won't be the first time.

45:00.527 --> 45:03.997
Here.
Afraid it won't keep you very warm.

45:04.047 --> 45:06.515
Yeah, it will.

45:09.207 --> 45:11.163
(Luk crying)

45:11.207 --> 45:14.483
Well, of course
Balto will come back.

45:14.527 --> 45:17.041
He's Balto, isn't he?

45:17.087 --> 45:20.079
Hey! I'm coming back
with the medicine.

45:20.127 --> 45:21.799
I promise, Jenna.

45:21.847 --> 45:24.042
Go ahead, guys. Take her home.

45:24.087 --> 45:27.477
Balto, I do not like
leaving you out here alone.

45:27.527 --> 45:30.564
Who's going to tell you
how cold you are?

45:30.607 --> 45:32.643
Boris.

45:32.687 --> 45:34.803
They need you even more than I do.

45:38.967 --> 45:41.765
Let me tell you something, Balto.

45:41.807 --> 45:45.083
A dog cannot make this journey alone.

45:46.407 --> 45:50.366
But maybe a wolf can.

45:52.407 --> 45:55.205
You two balls of fluff! Let's move!

45:55.247 --> 45:57.363
Hey! Two, three, four!

45:57.407 --> 46:00.046
(Telegraph wire beeping)
<i>Nome. Stop.</i>

46:00.087 --> 46:04.319
<i>Cannot send more antitoxin. Stop.</i>

46:04.367 --> 46:08.406
<i>Weather too severe. Stop.</i>

46:08.447 --> 46:12.156
<i>Lost sled team only hope. Stop.</i>

46:12.207 --> 46:15.597
<i>Our prayers are with them.</i>

46:15.647 --> 46:18.036
<i>Anchorage. Stop.</i>

46:44.407 --> 46:46.045
Steele.

46:55.007 --> 46:56.838
Oh!

46:59.447 --> 47:01.119
Balto!

47:01.167 --> 47:03.635
- Is that Balto?
- How did you find us?

47:03.687 --> 47:08.477
- Is anyone hurt?
- Everyone... is... fine.

47:08.527 --> 47:12.566
Yeah, but our musher hit his head
and he didn't get up.

47:12.607 --> 47:15.599
- And he's not movin'.
- All right, follow me.

47:15.647 --> 47:17.399
I can lead you home.

47:17.447 --> 47:20.325
We don't need your help!

47:20.367 --> 47:22.517
M-Maybe we should listen to him.

47:24.447 --> 47:26.278
How would youse get us home?

47:26.327 --> 47:29.603
Well, I marked the trail, like this.

47:29.647 --> 47:31.444
- Oh! Yeah!
- Ohh!

47:31.487 --> 47:35.366
I'll get us back.
I'm the lead dog. I'm in charge.

47:35.407 --> 47:39.195
Then let me take back the medicine.
They're getting sicker.

47:42.087 --> 47:46.160
Touch that box
and I'll tear you apart.

47:46.207 --> 47:49.085
- Two bones says Steele takes him.
- You're on.

47:51.247 --> 47:54.444
Steele, I'm not leaving
without that medicine.

47:55.847 --> 47:58.680
Who do you think you are?

47:58.727 --> 48:00.877
Hey, this is gonna be good.

48:00.927 --> 48:05.478
Since... Since when do you need
a pedigree to help someone?

48:07.927 --> 48:09.042
Steele.

48:09.087 --> 48:11.203
Let me help you.

48:11.247 --> 48:13.124
(Nikki) Look at his eyes!

48:20.647 --> 48:23.798
- He'll feel that tomorrow.
- He's feeling it now!

48:23.847 --> 48:25.485
Ouch!

48:25.527 --> 48:27.404
(Grunts)

48:27.447 --> 48:29.563
I don't want to fight.

48:29.607 --> 48:31.484
(Growling quietly)

48:34.927 --> 48:37.566
- Whoa! That can't be legal!
- Yeah!

48:38.647 --> 48:41.764
(Grunting)

48:45.287 --> 48:47.005
That stuff is fragile!

48:47.047 --> 48:49.845
What's with Steele?
Balto wants to help.

48:49.887 --> 48:52.117
Whoa!

48:52.167 --> 48:53.998
(Screams)

49:01.367 --> 49:03.244
(Laughing)

49:05.847 --> 49:08.202
Ah! Look!

49:10.487 --> 49:12.318
Huh?

49:21.847 --> 49:24.566
Aaah!

49:42.167 --> 49:45.318
(Musher groaning) Oh, good boy.

49:45.367 --> 49:47.642
Ahh.

50:00.887 --> 50:03.082
(Panting)

50:03.127 --> 50:05.197
(Groaning)

50:05.247 --> 50:07.078
Mush!

50:10.247 --> 50:13.523
Go ahead, wolf-dog!
You'll never get home!

50:14.687 --> 50:17.360
I'll make sure of that.

50:19.007 --> 50:20.998
I'll show 'em.

50:21.047 --> 50:24.323
Why not this way?
How about over here?

50:25.327 --> 50:27.887
Oops! Wrong way! (Sinister chuckling)

50:30.567 --> 50:32.285
Oh, no.

50:36.447 --> 50:38.199
Which way, Balto, which way?

50:38.247 --> 50:41.045
- Which way?
- Uh, this way.

50:54.247 --> 50:55.999
Huh?

50:58.767 --> 51:02.726
- Why are you taking us in circles?
- I'm not!

51:02.767 --> 51:06.521
I mean, I don't know. It's Steele.

51:06.567 --> 51:09.445
Maybe we was
better off with him there.

51:09.487 --> 51:11.398
No! Come on. Mush!

51:12.687 --> 51:14.405
(Star) Whoa-ohh!

51:18.127 --> 51:20.846
Balto, slow down! Wait... Uhh!

51:23.847 --> 51:26.645
Hey! Hey! Goin' too fast!

51:44.407 --> 51:45.886
Look out!

51:50.967 --> 51:53.003
(Star) All right!

51:53.047 --> 51:56.403
- Good catch, Balto!
- (Rumbling)

51:56.447 --> 51:58.722
Aaaah!

52:10.487 --> 52:11.966
I don't get it,

52:12.007 --> 52:15.204
how could Balto hope to
find Steele and his team?

52:15.247 --> 52:17.124
They were off the trail.

52:17.167 --> 52:19.203
Well, he's... tracking them.

52:19.247 --> 52:21.124
That mutt?

52:21.167 --> 52:24.443
Tracking a championship team
in a blizzard?

52:27.727 --> 52:29.683
- (Door opens)
- (All gasp)

52:30.967 --> 52:33.720
- Balto?
- Steele!

52:33.767 --> 52:36.486
- You're alive!
- You're back!

52:36.527 --> 52:40.156
- Where ya been?
- Are ya OK?

52:40.207 --> 52:42.402
Steele, w-where are the others?

52:42.447 --> 52:47.441
- What happened to you?
- Well, one by one they... fell.

52:47.487 --> 52:50.081
Frozen, barely alive.

52:53.647 --> 52:56.286
I pulled four onto the sled.

52:56.327 --> 52:59.125
Three more on my back!

53:01.127 --> 53:03.846
And, uh, I walked...

53:03.887 --> 53:05.764
and I walked,

53:05.807 --> 53:08.640
but i-it was just...
it was too late.

53:08.687 --> 53:10.598
- Ohh.
- They were...

53:10.647 --> 53:13.480
- What about the medicine?
- Yeah!

53:13.527 --> 53:15.836
Well, uh, I... I went on,

53:15.887 --> 53:18.481
d-dragging the medicine alone...

53:18.527 --> 53:20.085
all alone...

53:20.127 --> 53:22.083
and... and then suddenly...

53:23.327 --> 53:26.160
that wolf-dog appeared, Balto.

53:26.207 --> 53:29.404
H-He demanded I let him
take the medicine.

53:30.767 --> 53:35.522
You know, he just wanted
so much to be a hero in your eyes.

53:35.567 --> 53:38.445
And h-he grabbed the crate,

53:40.047 --> 53:42.277
but he couldn't handle it.

53:42.327 --> 53:44.761
H-He couldn't see the patch of ice...

53:44.807 --> 53:47.367
Th-The snow, the wind and...

53:47.407 --> 53:49.762
And then the log and the cliff...

53:49.807 --> 53:52.446
Well, he just didn't have a ch...

53:52.487 --> 53:53.840
He just...

53:53.887 --> 53:56.685
(Sobbing) I'm sorry.

53:56.807 --> 53:58.604
And then...

54:00.927 --> 54:03.361
My bandana!

54:03.407 --> 54:07.639
He... made me promise
to take care of you, Jenna.

54:07.687 --> 54:09.837
Ohh.

54:12.767 --> 54:14.644
You're lying.

54:14.687 --> 54:17.963
- (Dogs gasping)
- Steele's lying.

54:18.007 --> 54:19.884
Balto's alive.

54:19.927 --> 54:22.680
And he's coming home.

54:23.887 --> 54:28.403
Uh... Well, you know,
she needs a little time.

54:32.447 --> 54:34.324
(Sighs)

55:06.367 --> 55:09.916
The sun. Ice caps.

55:23.167 --> 55:24.805
Balto.

55:36.607 --> 55:38.245
Rosy.

56:12.647 --> 56:14.160
Hmm?

56:26.247 --> 56:28.556
(Boris) <i>Let me tell you something.</i>

56:28.607 --> 56:33.044
<i>A dog cannot
make this journey alone.</i>

56:33.087 --> 56:36.966
<i>But maybe a wolf can.</i>

57:14.207 --> 57:17.165
(Shivering)

57:17.207 --> 57:19.516
(Howling)

57:19.567 --> 57:20.966
(All) Huh?

57:21.007 --> 57:24.044
Things are not bad enough.
Now we got wolves.

57:24.087 --> 57:26.442
(All) Wolves?

57:26.487 --> 57:29.638
- Hey, over here!
- What is it? What?

57:29.687 --> 57:32.884
- Balto?
- And he's got the medicine!

57:32.927 --> 57:35.680
(Nikki) Come on, Balto.
Youse can make it.

57:39.287 --> 57:42.120
That's the most amazing,
fantastic, incredible...

57:42.167 --> 57:44.886
- Yeah!
- That's the most phenomenal...

57:44.927 --> 57:47.202
That's good! Ohh!

57:47.247 --> 57:51.001
(Nikki) Hey, he has got the feet
of a wolf there.

57:51.087 --> 57:54.079
- Come on, Balto.
- Keep tryin', baby.

57:54.127 --> 57:57.324
- Pull! Pull! You got it!
- Just keep pullin'!

57:57.367 --> 58:00.484
- You're almost there.
- Yeah! You got it!

58:00.527 --> 58:03.837
- Come on, Balto!
- Come on, let's go!

58:03.887 --> 58:07.243
- Let's go!
- Yes! You're there!

58:07.287 --> 58:10.404
- That's it, that's it!
- All right!

58:10.447 --> 58:13.280
- Yeah! All right!
- You did it!

58:13.327 --> 58:15.397
Congratulations! That was great!

58:48.887 --> 58:51.685
- (Balto) Hyah!
- (All barking)

59:06.007 --> 59:07.838
Yaaah!

59:07.887 --> 59:09.445
(Cracking)

59:11.007 --> 59:13.237
Come on! Mush!

59:20.447 --> 59:21.926
(Yelping)

59:28.647 --> 59:31.445
(Grunting and straining)

59:43.287 --> 59:46.518
Eeeh... Ahh-choo!

59:46.567 --> 59:49.764
- (Sneeze echoing)
- Gesundheit.

01:00:03.327 --> 01:00:05.158
(Rumbling)

01:00:34.087 --> 01:00:36.885
(Whining and shivering)

01:00:50.887 --> 01:00:52.400
Huh?

01:00:52.447 --> 01:00:56.235
(All gasping and whispering)

01:00:56.287 --> 01:00:58.642
Heh!

01:00:58.687 --> 01:01:00.678
Errr!

01:01:00.727 --> 01:01:02.604
Heh-heh!

01:01:02.647 --> 01:01:04.524
Ohhh!

01:01:05.567 --> 01:01:07.205
Huh?

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:09.158
(Whispering continues)

01:01:12.367 --> 01:01:14.198
Shh!

01:01:14.247 --> 01:01:16.556
Yeh... Ehh...

01:01:16.607 --> 01:01:18.484
Yaaah...

01:01:39.847 --> 01:01:42.361
Mush!

01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:59.039
Yaah!

01:02:18.327 --> 01:02:20.795
(Whispering)

01:02:24.047 --> 01:02:25.765
Oh, dear.

01:02:27.127 --> 01:02:29.641
Come back to bed.

01:02:32.887 --> 01:02:35.196
Here, drink this.

01:02:35.247 --> 01:02:36.600
Oh.

01:02:37.647 --> 01:02:39.524
Thanks.

01:02:41.367 --> 01:02:43.198
(Sighs)

01:02:54.007 --> 01:02:56.362
(Luk whimpering and crying)

01:02:56.407 --> 01:02:58.284
(Muk) Balto.

01:02:58.327 --> 01:03:00.158
(Sniffling)

01:03:03.287 --> 01:03:05.278
B-B-Balto.

01:03:05.327 --> 01:03:07.238
(Whimpering)

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:13.047
(Howling in the distance)

01:03:14.087 --> 01:03:15.600
Balto.

01:03:18.207 --> 01:03:20.323
Balto's back!

01:03:25.567 --> 01:03:27.046
Jenna.

01:03:31.567 --> 01:03:33.842
(Balto howling)

01:03:36.607 --> 01:03:38.484
- Ah!
- The team!

01:03:38.527 --> 01:03:40.597
They made it!

01:04:03.327 --> 01:04:05.204
Of course, as you know,

01:04:05.247 --> 01:04:07.317
I swam and I swam.

01:04:07.367 --> 01:04:09.597
I was freezing cold. And then...

01:04:11.687 --> 01:04:14.406
Finally, I said, Steele,

01:04:14.447 --> 01:04:17.325
you'll have to gnaw
your way to the surface.

01:04:17.367 --> 01:04:19.642
- (Balto howling)
- So I... What?

01:04:19.687 --> 01:04:22.565
It's Balto. With the medicine!

01:04:23.607 --> 01:04:25.086
Oh.

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:27.561
Steele, you are positively...

01:04:27.647 --> 01:04:30.161
disposable!

01:04:30.207 --> 01:04:31.686
Huh?

01:04:34.047 --> 01:04:37.357
(All growling)

01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:39.045
OK, OK. I can explain.

01:04:39.087 --> 01:04:40.964
- Tell me about it.
- Hmph!

01:04:41.007 --> 01:04:42.884
You guys weren't there, so...

01:04:42.927 --> 01:04:46.203
Wait a minute, guys.
Wait just a second. Please?

01:04:46.247 --> 01:04:47.396
Get lost.

01:04:48.887 --> 01:04:51.799
(People talking excitedly)

01:05:08.767 --> 01:05:12.396
Steady, there. Easy, now.
That's had a long journey.

01:05:12.447 --> 01:05:14.403
- How is he?
- He's gonna be OK.

01:05:32.207 --> 01:05:34.641
Good dog, Balto.

01:05:34.687 --> 01:05:36.086
Dear, dear Balto.

01:05:37.127 --> 01:05:39.402
Good boy!

01:05:39.447 --> 01:05:42.245
Aaaah! Not dog! Not wolf!

01:05:42.287 --> 01:05:44.676
You're a hero!

01:05:44.727 --> 01:05:47.366
(Muk) Balto!

01:05:54.567 --> 01:05:57.843
Come on, boy.
There's someone wants to see you.

01:05:57.927 --> 01:05:59.758
(Man) Thank you! Thank you!

01:05:59.807 --> 01:06:02.640
(Applause, cheering)

01:06:14.007 --> 01:06:15.725
Mommy?

01:06:15.767 --> 01:06:17.598
Rosy, darling. Ohh!

01:06:17.647 --> 01:06:20.207
- I fell asleep.
- Rosy.

01:06:23.967 --> 01:06:26.117
(Mom) It's such a relief.

01:06:33.887 --> 01:06:35.320
Balto.

01:06:36.327 --> 01:06:38.283
I'd be lost without you.

01:06:39.327 --> 01:06:41.204
(Coughing)

01:06:46.287 --> 01:06:47.879
Jenna.

01:07:03.607 --> 01:07:05.484
(Applause, cheering)

01:07:08.007 --> 01:07:10.077
(Star) Way to go, Balto!

01:07:10.127 --> 01:07:13.244
He has the most endurance,
fidelity, intelligence!

01:07:13.287 --> 01:07:15.676
They should build a statue of him!

01:07:15.727 --> 01:07:18.446
- You said it!
- I did?

01:07:29.807 --> 01:07:32.116
(Howling)

01:07:43.687 --> 01:07:46.485
This is it, Grandma.
Blaze found it.

01:07:48.327 --> 01:07:49.840
Oh. Yes.

01:07:54.367 --> 01:07:56.562
(Grandma) What does it say?

01:07:56.607 --> 01:08:00.566
"Dedicated to the..." Indomable?

01:08:00.607 --> 01:08:02.484
Indomitable.

01:08:02.527 --> 01:08:07.282
"Indomitable spirit
of the sled dogs..."

01:08:07.327 --> 01:08:10.160
(Grandma)
"...that relayed antitoxin

01:08:10.207 --> 01:08:15.520
"600 miles from Nenana
to the relief of stricken Nome...

01:08:15.607 --> 01:08:18.564
"in the winter of 1925."

01:08:18.607 --> 01:08:22.520
(Girl)
"Endurance, fidelity, intelligence."

01:08:22.567 --> 01:08:25.365
Balto really did do all of that,
didn't he?

01:08:25.407 --> 01:08:27.602
Oh, yes, sweetheart, he really did.

01:08:27.647 --> 01:08:30.286
And today they run
the Iditarod Dog Race

01:08:30.327 --> 01:08:33.205
over the very path
he and the others took.

01:08:33.247 --> 01:08:36.876
- Can Blaze do that too, Grandma?
- Maybe.

01:08:36.926 --> 01:08:38.962
With practice.

01:08:40.207 --> 01:08:43.085
A lot of practice.

01:08:43.127 --> 01:08:45.560
Come on, Blaze. Come on! Mush!

01:08:52.487 --> 01:08:54.557
Thank you, Balto.

01:08:54.607 --> 01:08:57.484
I would've been lost without you.

01:09:00.447 --> 01:09:02.278
Grandma Rosy!

01:09:06.966 --> 01:09:09.082
Grandma Rosy, come on!

01:09:30.087 --> 01:09:33.477
€ Deep in the night

01:09:33.527 --> 01:09:37.600
€ The winds blow cold

01:09:37.647 --> 01:09:41.322
€ And in a heartbeat

01:09:41.367 --> 01:09:44.676
€ The fear takes hold

01:09:45.767 --> 01:09:49.203
€ Deep in the storm

01:09:49.247 --> 01:09:53.160
€ There's a place
that's soft and still

01:09:53.207 --> 01:09:57.280
€ Where the road waits to be taken

01:09:57.327 --> 01:10:01.161
€ If you only will

01:10:01.207 --> 01:10:05.086
€ The voices inside you

01:10:05.127 --> 01:10:09.006
€ Can lead you so astray

01:10:09.047 --> 01:10:12.960
€ Believe in what you dream

01:10:13.007 --> 01:10:14.725
€ Don't turn away

01:10:14.767 --> 01:10:17.122
€ Don't you turn away

01:10:17.167 --> 01:10:20.796
€ Reach for the light

01:10:20.847 --> 01:10:24.840
€ You might touch the sky

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:28.516
€ Stand on a mountain top

01:10:28.567 --> 01:10:32.879
€ And see yourself flyin'

01:10:32.927 --> 01:10:36.442
€ Reach for the light

01:10:36.487 --> 01:10:40.321
€ To capture a star

01:10:40.367 --> 01:10:44.360
€ Come out of the darkness

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:46.284
€ And find out

01:10:46.327 --> 01:10:50.366
€ Who you are

01:10:57.247 --> 01:10:59.920
€ Somewhere in time

01:10:59.967 --> 01:11:03.357
€ The truth shines through

01:11:05.367 --> 01:11:07.756
€ And the spirit knows

01:11:07.807 --> 01:11:10.879
€ What it has to do

01:11:12.087 --> 01:11:15.523
€ Somewhere in you

01:11:15.567 --> 01:11:19.526
€ There's a power with no name

01:11:19.567 --> 01:11:23.526
€ It can rise to meet the moment

01:11:23.567 --> 01:11:27.526
€ And burn like a flame

01:11:27.567 --> 01:11:31.480
