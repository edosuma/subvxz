00:24.805 --> 00:27.069
It's a good weight.
Anyone asks...

00:27.140 --> 00:30.303
Don't pee your pants,
Freddy. Bad for the rubber.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.570
There it is.
Pure as a virgin's...

00:34.648 --> 00:36.047
Where the hell?

00:36.116 --> 00:37.640
You heard our guest
wears a goatee now?

00:37.718 --> 00:39.276
Yeah, I'm on it.

00:39.353 --> 00:41.913
I can watch the whole thing
go down from the kitchen.

00:43.156 --> 00:45.249
All right,
I better set up.

00:45.959 --> 00:47.290
I owe you.

00:58.705 --> 01:00.195
It went okay?

01:01.708 --> 01:05.200
It's 4:00 in the morning.
Don't you have a job to go to?

01:05.278 --> 01:07.246
Don't tease me.
What happened?

01:09.783 --> 01:11.182
Oh, Josh.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.280
Baby, I knew it.

01:14.354 --> 01:16.481
Now, come on.
It's not a done deal.

01:17.157 --> 01:18.454
Why? What went wrong?

01:19.860 --> 01:21.088
Nothing.

01:29.169 --> 01:30.864
Sure, with the goatee.

01:31.671 --> 01:33.036
Oh, my God.

01:33.540 --> 01:35.007
I'm finished.

01:37.110 --> 01:39.408
Look, don't tell me
I'm gonna be all right!

01:39.913 --> 01:42.074
No, I'm...
All right, I'm...

01:44.317 --> 01:45.341
Sure.

01:46.052 --> 01:47.952
Yeah. Whatever you say.

01:58.632 --> 02:00.327
Is everything okay,
Mr. Barry?

02:00.400 --> 02:01.628
Mmm-hmm.

02:12.813 --> 02:17.375
G- C. Spa. It or.
Tea loop.

02:29.329 --> 02:30.523
Bitch!

02:34.201 --> 02:35.327
I was going to call you...
Boaz...

02:35.402 --> 02:36.835
I said that I'm sorry.
If you want me to...

02:36.903 --> 02:39.497
No, there's something
dripping on you.

02:42.275 --> 02:43.401
It's blood.

02:56.022 --> 02:59.287
Please help me.

03:55.348 --> 03:58.078
We've got a Jane Doe
dressed like a John Doe,

03:58.151 --> 04:00.142
beaten to death
in the shadow of the UN,

04:00.220 --> 04:02.711
discovered by
an Israeli diplomat.

04:03.356 --> 04:05.221
The diplomatic corps
expects special treatment

04:05.292 --> 04:07.487
when they trip over a
stiff, so we called you.

04:07.561 --> 04:09.620
It's nice
to be wanted.

04:09.696 --> 04:11.596
She died right after
the diplomat found her.

04:11.665 --> 04:14.657
No wallet, no keys.
Just this in her jacket.

04:17.571 --> 04:22.304
<i>G- C. Spa.
It or. Tea loop.</i>

04:23.410 --> 04:24.672
Big help.

04:25.512 --> 04:29.972
All right, there are blunt
force and sharp-impact wounds,

04:32.052 --> 04:34.452
on all sides of
her head and neck.

04:35.255 --> 04:36.779
A rage attack?

04:37.123 --> 04:40.388
There are girl bars over
on 2nd. Maybe a gay bash?

04:43.830 --> 04:45.320
A false beard.

04:47.767 --> 04:49.132
It's a goatee.

04:53.306 --> 04:55.297
Glue residue
on her chin.

04:57.911 --> 05:02.644
A disguise, coded message, she
wasn't cross-dressing for fun.

05:05.285 --> 05:10.018
Forty-one wounds, including the
broken rib that pierced her spleen.

05:10.090 --> 05:11.182
She bled to death.

05:11.257 --> 05:13.782
For six hours
alone on an overpass.

05:15.428 --> 05:17.089
These bruises,
could they be kicks?

05:17.163 --> 05:20.724
Well, there's a very demarcated
pattern, lots of deep tissue trauma.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.200
You don't usually see that from kicking.

05:24.571 --> 05:27.699
Well, a tall girl like her
might have made a run for it,

05:27.774 --> 05:31.107
if it weren't for the 10-course
feast sitting in her stomach.

05:31.177 --> 05:32.474
Ten courses?

05:32.545 --> 05:37.107
Chicken, fish, beef,
goat, plantains, beer.

05:37.183 --> 05:39.947
Sounds like she ate
half of Noah's ark.

05:40.020 --> 05:41.385
Spices?

05:41.454 --> 05:42.978
Curry, coconut.

05:44.157 --> 05:46.489
Curried goat,
could be West Indian.

05:46.559 --> 05:49.357
And her tape,
the sounds at the end.

05:49.996 --> 05:52.226
<i>It or. Tea loop.</i>

05:53.400 --> 05:55.664
<i>A door opening, reggae music.</i>

05:56.536 --> 05:58.197
Restaurant sounds.

05:58.805 --> 06:01.865
A food critic might taste
four or five entrées.

06:01.941 --> 06:05.377
They wouldn't want to be
recognized, they go out in disguise.

06:05.445 --> 06:07.242
And make crib notes.

06:09.883 --> 06:11.817
Sally had us drop her off at the corner.

06:11.885 --> 06:15.082
She told me she'd send me
her review by the morning.

06:15.388 --> 06:17.151
This is so horrible.

06:17.490 --> 06:19.355
We appreciate
your meeting us here.

06:19.426 --> 06:22.520
When she got out, you
notice anybody on the street?

06:22.595 --> 06:23.960
No, no one.

06:24.831 --> 06:26.924
And she was tough.
This review,

06:27.000 --> 06:30.197
"Cajun pea soup with the
texture of a bayou swamp,

06:30.270 --> 06:32.033
"and the aroma
to match. "

06:32.105 --> 06:33.629
She didn't
mince words.

06:33.707 --> 06:36.107
It's why our readers
trusted her.

06:37.610 --> 06:39.237
It's white rice.

06:40.380 --> 06:43.110
She was eating white rice
and drinking ginger ale.

06:43.183 --> 06:44.172
Was she sick?

06:44.250 --> 06:47.913
She got food poisoning at a restaurant
last Thursday. Knocked her out.

06:49.489 --> 06:50.717
Do you know
what restaurant?

06:50.790 --> 06:51.950
No.

06:52.025 --> 06:54.516
Unless I went with her,
I never knew where she ate

06:54.594 --> 06:56.459
until she handed in
her copy.

06:56.529 --> 06:57.723
One of these?

06:57.797 --> 06:59.492
Each one has
a restaurant name.

06:59.566 --> 07:02.034
Maybe notes for reviews
she hadn't written.

07:02.102 --> 07:03.569
She used code.

07:03.636 --> 07:05.501
Don't ask me
what it was.

07:06.873 --> 07:09.603
Thank you, Ms. White.
We'll be in touch.

07:13.279 --> 07:14.712
You poison
a food critic,

07:14.781 --> 07:17.215
you can kiss your
restaurant goodbye.

07:21.554 --> 07:22.714
Apice.

07:23.590 --> 07:25.820
Is that one of the
restaurants on those tapes?

07:25.892 --> 07:27.757
Yeah. Apice Trattoria.

07:29.329 --> 07:31.388
From a trade magazine,
six months ago.

07:31.464 --> 07:34.831
"Trovo protégé Joshua
Mailer opens new eatery. "

07:35.969 --> 07:37.596
Fancy motorcycle.

07:38.838 --> 07:40.465
Fancier footwear.

07:40.907 --> 07:42.932
Metal-tipped
cowboy boots.

07:43.209 --> 07:46.007
Those would make
some deep tissue trauma.

07:49.315 --> 07:52.079
Detectives? You must be here about Josh.

07:52.152 --> 07:55.781
His wife is in the kitchen.
She filed the missing persons.

07:56.623 --> 07:59.183
Beatrice,
it's the police.

08:00.326 --> 08:01.588
You found him?

08:02.295 --> 08:06.254
No, we haven't. I'm Detective
Eames. This is Detective Goren.

08:06.332 --> 08:10.928
Yeah, we thought that
we'd go over your report.

08:13.106 --> 08:16.940
Now, your husband has been
missing since when exactly?

08:17.010 --> 08:19.376
Monday night.
It's all like I said.

08:20.613 --> 08:23.343
He didn't come home by
the time I left for work.

08:23.416 --> 08:25.441
What time
was that again?

08:25.518 --> 08:26.917
<i>4:00 a. m., Tuesday.</i>

08:27.520 --> 08:30.717
I work as a pastry chef
at my father's restaurant.

08:31.224 --> 08:33.556
I was trying to call
him on his cell all day.

08:33.626 --> 08:35.423
When he didn't show up
here Tuesday afternoon,

08:35.495 --> 08:37.258
I knew something
was wrong.

08:38.164 --> 08:40.394
And the last time
you talked to him?

08:41.167 --> 08:43.601
Monday night,
before he came here.

08:44.304 --> 08:45.828
It's closed
on Monday,

08:45.905 --> 08:48.931
but he comes in to plan
the menus and do the books.

08:49.542 --> 08:51.032
He works here?

08:51.611 --> 08:52.942
Do you mind
if we have a look?

08:53.012 --> 08:54.104
No.

08:55.081 --> 08:57.572
Any chance he's partying somewhere?

08:57.650 --> 08:59.550
Never.

08:59.619 --> 09:00.984
Apice is his life.

09:01.054 --> 09:05.115
Was he wearing these boots Monday
night, these metal-tipped boots?

09:05.491 --> 09:08.983
Yeah, he wears them
every day, for good luck.

09:10.864 --> 09:13.731
How was his mood? Was
he depressed or angry?

09:13.800 --> 09:17.668
Tired, stressed.
Apice was taking off.

09:17.737 --> 09:20.900
Any trouble with these
folks here? Food critics.

09:20.974 --> 09:24.876
I heard that restaurants, they keep
a rogue's gallery to identify them.

09:24.944 --> 09:26.969
That's Sally Moore,
with the goatee.

09:27.046 --> 09:29.207
She was here
last Thursday night.

09:29.616 --> 09:30.981
How did that go?

09:31.184 --> 09:33.709
Josh said
he put out a perfect meal.

09:34.053 --> 09:37.420
He's just one good review
away from breaking through.

09:37.490 --> 09:39.651
Could we see Sally Moore's reservation?

09:39.726 --> 09:44.288
It was under the name Ed Dayton,
8:00 p. m., party of four.

09:44.364 --> 09:45.956
Mr. Dayton was one
of her dinner guests.

09:46.032 --> 09:48.057
It's here, Table 5,
our best table.

09:48.134 --> 09:50.898
Looks like you had to bump
somebody, there's a name crossed off.

09:50.970 --> 09:53.063
Why all of this interest in Sally Moore?

09:53.139 --> 09:55.073
My husband is
the one who's missing.

09:55.141 --> 09:59.305
Did he tell you Ms. Moore got
food poisoning after her meal?

09:59.379 --> 10:01.472
No. No.
That's not possible.

10:01.547 --> 10:03.777
He said it went well.
Where did you hear that lie?

10:03.850 --> 10:05.215
While investigating
her murder.

10:05.285 --> 10:07.845
She was beaten to death
Monday night.

10:11.057 --> 10:12.422
Oh, my God.

10:13.993 --> 10:15.085
I thought that...

10:15.161 --> 10:16.753
You thought what?

10:17.664 --> 10:20.064
There something
you're not telling us?

10:20.133 --> 10:21.600
Oh.

10:21.668 --> 10:24.694
When I came home from work
on Tuesday afternoon,

10:24.771 --> 10:28.263
I found Josh's wedding ring.
He'd left it by the sink.

10:28.341 --> 10:29.706
You thought
he'd left you?

10:29.776 --> 10:31.243
I didn't know
what to think.

10:34.681 --> 10:35.841
Apice.

10:37.083 --> 10:39.210
One moment.
It's the police.

10:42.555 --> 10:44.523
This is
Beatrice Mailer.

10:45.358 --> 10:47.155
Yeah, that's the one.

10:48.861 --> 10:50.192
Thank you.

10:52.799 --> 10:54.824
They found his motorcycle.

10:55.868 --> 10:59.463
If he just wanted to ditch his
bike, there are better places.

10:59.539 --> 11:03.373
Maybe after he went home, he felt
guilty about killing the critic.

11:03.443 --> 11:06.537
Next stop could've been
the bottom of the river.

11:08.848 --> 11:10.110
Except...

11:11.150 --> 11:13.380
Except this bike
is beautiful,

11:14.287 --> 11:17.484
it's clean,
it's well cared for.

11:18.291 --> 11:20.282
Someone wanted us to
believe that he would

11:20.360 --> 11:23.090
leave the kickstand down
in this soft sand,

11:23.162 --> 11:25.858
so it would just
fall over in the rocks.

11:26.132 --> 11:29.397
Maybe if he was in a hurry.
Suicides aren't in a hurry.

11:29.469 --> 11:31.334
But people on the run are.

11:31.404 --> 11:34.532
He wants us to call
off the hunt. Nice try.

11:36.442 --> 11:38.410
Food poisoning?
That's nuts.

11:38.478 --> 11:40.776
No, no. That doesn't
mean anything.

11:40.847 --> 11:42.781
I told you,
he'll show up.

11:42.849 --> 11:45.249
Hung over,
tail between his legs.

11:45.618 --> 11:47.813
Everything's gonna
be all right, baby.

11:48.388 --> 11:49.548
I love you.

11:49.622 --> 11:51.249
Poor kid. How's she handling it?

11:51.324 --> 11:54.657
Not good. I want you to go over
there, you know, check on her.

11:54.727 --> 11:56.194
And while you're there,
maybe check on his books.

11:56.262 --> 11:57.320
See if there's
something we can do.

11:57.397 --> 11:59.126
Tommy...
Just do it.

12:05.505 --> 12:09.339
So far, Josh hasn't accessed
his credit cards or his ATM.

12:09.409 --> 12:11.969
He might not have to. A lot of
cash in the restaurant business.

12:12.045 --> 12:13.273
You put a trace
on his cell phone?

12:13.346 --> 12:15.314
The last time he used
it was Monday night.

12:15.381 --> 12:17.941
He got a call from a pay
phone downtown around 9:00.

12:18.017 --> 12:20.008
Hour later he made two
calls to the critic.

12:20.086 --> 12:22.646
She was out, he didn't leave a message.

12:22.989 --> 12:24.354
Pay phone call.

12:24.424 --> 12:27.484
Somebody telling him about the
food poisoning and the bad review?

12:27.560 --> 12:30.427
He might've called the critic to
try to talk her out of running it.

12:30.496 --> 12:32.896
Except I can't
find a bad review.

12:33.599 --> 12:36.090
These are the notes on
Apice. Let me just...

12:38.504 --> 12:40.870
<i>Anut ratrat. Osgood.</i>

12:41.407 --> 12:43.637
<i>Enolaba. Emilbus.</i>

12:44.210 --> 12:46.007
That's backward talk.

12:46.546 --> 12:48.571
"Anut ratrat. "
Tuna tartar.

12:48.648 --> 12:50.240
"Enolaba. " Abalone.

12:50.316 --> 12:52.011
"Emilbus. " Sublime.

12:52.085 --> 12:53.382
Sounds like
she liked the grub.

12:53.453 --> 12:55.387
Before she got
food poisoning.

12:55.455 --> 12:56.854
Even after that.

12:56.923 --> 12:59.687
She had the whole weekend to
write a bad review. She didn't.

12:59.759 --> 13:01.056
No one told the kid.

13:01.127 --> 13:03.357
But somebody told him
she got food poisoning.

13:03.429 --> 13:06.125
He might've had a source close to home.

13:06.632 --> 13:09.157
Like Josh's father-in-law
Tommy Onerato.

13:10.503 --> 13:12.471
He owns a three-star
restaurant, Trovo.

13:12.538 --> 13:15.006
He has a cooking show,
books.

13:16.175 --> 13:20.475
If anyone has an inside track
on food critics, Tommy would.

13:24.150 --> 13:25.879
Food poisoning?
Oh, man.

13:25.952 --> 13:27.977
I wish Josh
had called me.

13:28.054 --> 13:29.419
Sopressata?

13:29.989 --> 13:30.978
Thanks.

13:32.225 --> 13:35.023
I would've talked the
kid down from the ledge.

13:35.094 --> 13:36.561
Duke, grappa.

13:37.063 --> 13:38.462
You didn't talk
to him Monday?

13:38.531 --> 13:40.522
No. We're dark on Mondays. I ate out.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.034
Poubelle's, Nolita's
and Ludlow's.

13:43.302 --> 13:45.167
Three meals. That's quite an appetite.

13:45.238 --> 13:47.672
Hey, I gotta see
what's out there.

13:52.044 --> 13:54.444
Catignano,
my old man's hometown.

13:54.580 --> 13:55.740
Chin-chin.

13:58.584 --> 14:00.074
We're on duty.

14:04.290 --> 14:05.814
Your own brand, huh?

14:07.360 --> 14:08.725
It's musky.

14:09.562 --> 14:11.655
You know,
we were wondering,

14:11.998 --> 14:15.627
how do you think Josh found
out that Sally Moore got sick?

14:16.669 --> 14:20.127
Publicists, foodies.
Word gets around.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.736
Josh had the same photos
on his fridge.

14:24.577 --> 14:27.637
Including this one
right here. Sally Moore.

14:27.713 --> 14:30.546
She gets downloaded
more than Paris Hilton.

14:30.616 --> 14:33.642
You sure Josh didn't hear about
the food poisoning from you?

14:33.719 --> 14:34.777
I'm sure.

14:34.854 --> 14:37.448
Tommy,
the mayor's sister.

14:37.723 --> 14:39.088
Table 6, VIP.

14:39.158 --> 14:42.321
You mentioned talking
Josh off the ledge.

14:42.395 --> 14:44.488
He like that?
You know, over-reacts?

14:45.131 --> 14:47.725
Well, he shouldn't have
rushed into his own place.

14:47.800 --> 14:51.292
I mean, I put him on my show,
thought it would help him out.

14:51.370 --> 14:53.736
But he only worked for me for
two years, college is four.

14:53.806 --> 14:56.331
And now he's married
to your daughter.

14:56.876 --> 14:59.174
This table here,
last Thursday.

14:59.845 --> 15:00.971
Schulman.
That's the party

15:01.047 --> 15:04.881
that got bumped at Apice, so
Sally Moore could get their table.

15:06.018 --> 15:08.578
This looks like they
got squeezed in at 8:15.

15:08.654 --> 15:10.019
Oh, yeah.
Josh had called me.

15:10.089 --> 15:11.818
He double-booked, asked
me to do him a favor.

15:11.891 --> 15:14.086
Tommy, the new kid's an idiot.

15:15.428 --> 15:17.828
Aldo! Aldo!

15:23.102 --> 15:24.194
Look.

15:24.837 --> 15:28.830
Sally Moore's reservation was
booked under the name of Ed Dayton.

15:29.308 --> 15:31.367
Now, if Josh bumped
the Schulmans,

15:31.444 --> 15:33.435
he must've known that the
Dayton reservation was hers.

15:33.512 --> 15:34.877
Maybe Josh
knows Dayton

15:34.947 --> 15:37.882
and that's who told him
about the food poisoning.

15:40.219 --> 15:41.743
I've never met
Josh Mailer,

15:41.821 --> 15:44.016
but Sally's used my name
before to make reservations.

15:44.090 --> 15:45.284
Maybe at Trovo?

15:45.358 --> 15:48.225
Yes. We went
sometime last year.

15:48.294 --> 15:51.229
Josh used to work there. He
might have remembered your name.

15:51.297 --> 15:55.631
After you stopped vomiting,
did you call Apice to complain?

15:55.701 --> 15:58.693
No. I told Sally I spent
the night at Saint Vincent's,

15:58.771 --> 15:59.999
but other than that...

16:00.072 --> 16:03.337
The food that made you sick, only
the people at your table ate it?

16:03.409 --> 16:04.671
It was a special.

16:04.744 --> 16:07.110
White abalone
from Santa Barbara.

16:07.179 --> 16:10.376
Soon as the waiter mentioned
it, Sally's eyes lit up.

16:10.449 --> 16:11.541
I bet they did.

16:11.617 --> 16:13.744
White abalone
is an endangered species.

16:13.819 --> 16:17.448
Sally said she hadn't had them
since she was a kid in Santa Cruz.

16:17.523 --> 16:19.320
A dish she
couldn't refuse.

16:19.392 --> 16:21.155
Mr. Dayton, could
our medical examiner

16:21.227 --> 16:23.218
take a look at
your hospital tests?

16:23.296 --> 16:24.695
I don't see why not.
Mr. Dayton?

16:24.764 --> 16:26.095
Excuse me.

16:27.700 --> 16:29.998
Josh found out Sally Moore was coming.

16:30.069 --> 16:33.197
Booted his regulars to
give her his best table.

16:33.272 --> 16:36.366
Prepared the one dish
she's guaranteed to order.

16:36.642 --> 16:39.167
And that's the one
that poisons her.

16:40.146 --> 16:41.204
Whatever they ate

16:41.280 --> 16:43.976
was infected with a type of
salmonella specific to chicken.

16:44.050 --> 16:45.915
There's no chance
it came from seafood?

16:45.985 --> 16:48.545
Not unless it was
chicken of the sea.

16:48.621 --> 16:52.557
Look, somebody handled raw chicken
before preparing the abalone.

16:52.625 --> 16:56.083
Serves them right for eating
a poor endangered bivalve.

16:56.662 --> 16:59.460
I don't remember
chicken on Apice's menu.

16:59.999 --> 17:02.695
The abalone was
earmarked for Sally Moore,

17:02.768 --> 17:05.862
Josh would've watched
over it like a mother hen,

17:06.305 --> 17:08.603
unless it was contaminated
before it got to him.

17:08.674 --> 17:11.871
That abalone didn't just
walk into his restaurant.

17:13.479 --> 17:15.503
White abalone?
Not me.

17:15.580 --> 17:17.138
You sell those, they
take away your stall.

17:17.215 --> 17:19.844
Not even for a good
customer like Josh Mailer?

17:19.919 --> 17:22.251
His restaurant said he
got all his fish from you.

17:22.320 --> 17:23.878
I have enough customers.

17:23.955 --> 17:27.618
You think I want to end up working
out of a van like those guys?

17:27.693 --> 17:29.558
Any van
in particular?

17:30.162 --> 17:31.561
Try Rhode Island.

17:34.367 --> 17:35.527
Morning.

17:37.069 --> 17:38.627
Heading back
to Providence?

17:38.704 --> 17:40.638
Just trying to
make a living.

17:40.740 --> 17:44.176
We're just checking if you
ever sold fish to this guy.

17:44.577 --> 17:45.874
Never seen him.
Sorry.

17:45.945 --> 17:48.937
Really? Because we heard
you sell special fish.

17:49.014 --> 17:51.608
You know, stuff like
cobia, abalone?

17:51.684 --> 17:53.982
You ever sell
any white abalone?

17:54.120 --> 17:56.020
White abalone, you kidding
me? That's way too hot.

17:56.088 --> 17:57.180
Yeah?

18:00.092 --> 18:01.559
Smells musky.

18:02.728 --> 18:04.525
That's grappa, right?

18:08.467 --> 18:10.367
You keep a bottle
of it in here?

18:10.436 --> 18:11.801
Takes the bite
out of the morning.

18:11.871 --> 18:13.361
I'll bet it does.

18:17.309 --> 18:19.743
This is Tommy Onerato's
home brew.

18:21.781 --> 18:25.979
Was he here last week,
buying some white abalone?

18:27.753 --> 18:29.084
Tommy who?

18:29.455 --> 18:32.686
Tell you what, we're taking
a bite out of your morning.

18:32.758 --> 18:36.888
We're impounding your van on
suspicion of selling contraband fish.

18:37.530 --> 18:39.521
Sit on him
till DEC gets here.

18:41.100 --> 18:46.094
So maybe Tommy Onerato bought the
abalone for Josh and poisoned it.

18:46.939 --> 18:50.807
I guess he's not as fond of his
son-in-law as he wanted us to believe.

18:50.876 --> 18:52.241
We're in a tough
business.

18:52.311 --> 18:55.838
Let's not fault Josh for
failing to handle the pressure,

18:56.415 --> 19:00.044
or ourselves for failing
to see the warning signs.

19:01.220 --> 19:04.883
But as for the future, I think
you all know my partner Duke.

19:05.591 --> 19:09.493
Folks, we've looked at keeping
Apice alive, but without Josh...

19:10.396 --> 19:12.660
Tommy has promised Beatrice
he'll find all of you work,

19:12.731 --> 19:15.928
either at Trovo, or one
of our sister restaurants.

19:16.302 --> 19:18.270
And let's toast Josh.

19:18.337 --> 19:19.804
A good man,
and a great chef.

19:19.872 --> 19:20.896
Here, here.

19:20.973 --> 19:22.634
To Josh.
To Josh.

19:31.116 --> 19:33.016
It's the holidays,
I get lots of gifts.

19:33.085 --> 19:36.714
No, see, this gift had Tommy
Onerato's fingerprints on it.

19:37.189 --> 19:40.886
So one more time, Freddy, did
you sell him white abalone?

19:41.126 --> 19:43.617
My client's invoking his right
against self-incrimination.

19:43.696 --> 19:45.926
For selling
endangered shellfish?

19:45.998 --> 19:49.024
Solve your murder case
without him. He's invoking.

19:49.568 --> 19:52.230
Say Tommy did poison
the abalone,

19:53.205 --> 19:57.198
it's a lot of work just to submarine
his son-in-law's restaurant.

19:57.276 --> 20:00.803
Yeah, the son-in-law nobody's
heard from in over a week.

20:01.647 --> 20:03.547
You know, this bike,
it's making less sense

20:03.616 --> 20:05.709
that he would've
left it this way.

20:06.719 --> 20:08.243
But Tommy...

20:08.320 --> 20:09.617
Tommy's not a man
of half measures,

20:09.688 --> 20:10.985
what if he went
the whole way?

20:11.056 --> 20:13.388
He killed Josh
and the critic.

20:13.459 --> 20:15.791
The critic was kicked to
death with Josh's boots.

20:15.861 --> 20:18.523
Well, Tommy could've taken
the boots off of Josh's body.

20:18.597 --> 20:21.589
After Beatrice went to work,
could've went to Josh's place,

20:21.667 --> 20:23.225
left the wedding ring,
and then junked the bike.

20:23.302 --> 20:25.634
All in one night?
His alibi?

20:25.704 --> 20:28.673
Dinners at three restaurants.
The call to Josh Monday night

20:28.741 --> 20:30.675
was made from
a pay phone midway

20:30.743 --> 20:32.802
between two
of those restaurants.

20:32.878 --> 20:35.346
That's a lot
for one man to do.

20:35.414 --> 20:37.541
His motive would
have to be profound.

20:37.616 --> 20:39.846
Could be money. I'll
pull the financials.

20:39.919 --> 20:41.978
You read. I'll watch.

20:42.655 --> 20:44.088
<i>And for his
Easter appetizer,</i>

20:44.156 --> 20:46.750
<i>our guest chef, Josh,
has chosen artichokes.</i>

20:46.825 --> 20:50.317
<i>Ah! His carciofi alla
romana is just about done.</i>

20:50.396 --> 20:54.230
<i>Now, the leaves are just beginning
to get a nice crisp texture,</i>

20:54.300 --> 20:56.234
<i>which is what you want when
preparing a dish like this.</i>

20:56.302 --> 20:57.360
<i>And if you're
worried about</i>

20:57.436 --> 20:59.870
<i>your carciofi sticking to
the pan like Josh's are,</i>

20:59.939 --> 21:01.133
<i>then just
add a little water.</i>

21:01.206 --> 21:02.468
<i>Oh!</i>

21:02.541 --> 21:05.533
<i>You might want to remember
to put a lid on that pan.</i>

21:05.611 --> 21:07.238
Competitive much?

21:08.047 --> 21:09.947
All the way to dessert.

21:11.183 --> 21:13.651
<i>To finish off
this Valentine's Day meal,</i>

21:13.719 --> 21:17.655
<i>my VSV, my very special
valentine, Beatrice,</i>

21:17.723 --> 21:19.657
<i>suggested
her VSV crépe</i>

21:19.725 --> 21:22.626
<i>filled with ripe raspberries
and dark chocolate.</i>

21:23.796 --> 21:25.991
<i>Just about done.
And ecco!</i>

21:29.902 --> 21:33.235
<i>And you know, Josh, when
your VSV works in my kitchen,</i>

21:33.305 --> 21:37.799
<i>we like to make things just a little
hotter by adding a little VSOP.</i>

21:39.044 --> 21:42.741
<i>And that creates a dessert
that captures all your senses.</i>

21:49.254 --> 21:51.848
Every time Josh gets
approval from the audience,

21:51.924 --> 21:54.119
Tommy tries to
undermine him.

21:55.527 --> 21:57.495
He's threatened
by his star student.

21:57.563 --> 21:58.962
Not financially.

21:59.031 --> 22:02.694
Apice was deep in the red,
while Trovo was booming.

22:05.204 --> 22:08.367
Well, maybe the territory that
Josh and Tommy were fighting over

22:08.440 --> 22:10.101
was not the food.

22:14.146 --> 22:16.774
Beatrice's shift
starts in five hours.

22:19.051 --> 22:21.076
Well, I'll get
some sleep.

22:23.622 --> 22:26.250
<i>The trick to
a really good osso buco</i>

22:26.325 --> 22:30.125
<i>is to separate the meat from
the bone before you cook them.</i>

22:36.135 --> 22:39.593
Apice couldn't go on without
Josh. It's been two weeks.

22:40.439 --> 22:43.340
It's probably better if
I just assume the worst.

22:43.409 --> 22:47.106
Well, your father swallowed
up Apice with hardly a burp.

22:47.546 --> 22:49.013
Tommy was very fond
of Josh.

22:49.081 --> 22:50.378
You could've
fooled us.

22:50.449 --> 22:53.885
We watched tapes of your dad's
cooking show when Josh was a guest.

22:53.952 --> 22:57.718
It looked like two cooks was
one too many in that kitchen.

22:57.790 --> 23:01.351
To get to where Dad's gotten,
you need an alpha personality.

23:01.427 --> 23:04.089
In the past, my lovers have
found that intimidating.

23:04.163 --> 23:06.961
Alpha personalities,
they demand loyalty.

23:08.167 --> 23:10.601
It sounds like your father felt betrayed

23:10.669 --> 23:12.296
that Josh opened
his own restaurant.

23:12.371 --> 23:14.896
He said Josh rushed into
it before he was ready.

23:14.973 --> 23:16.133
Well, maybe
he was right.

23:16.208 --> 23:18.870
As it turns out, it seems like all
the pressure was too much for him.

23:18.944 --> 23:21.640
Is that why he asked your dad for help?

23:23.482 --> 23:25.211
Oh, he didn't
tell you?

23:25.584 --> 23:29.816
The white abalone he served Sally
Moore, the dish that made her sick,

23:29.888 --> 23:31.856
your dad got it
for him.

23:32.424 --> 23:33.516
That's not possible.

23:33.592 --> 23:37.028
Beatrice, Josh didn't
crack under pressure.

23:38.597 --> 23:42.363
We think your dad spiked
the abalone. He set Josh up.

23:46.071 --> 23:48.062
You're tearing
the dough.

23:50.843 --> 23:53.539
No one would believe
a story like that.

23:59.151 --> 24:01.119
The way she was making
googly eyes at you,

24:01.186 --> 24:02.813
I thought you were gonna
get through to her.

24:02.888 --> 24:05.220
She probably does that with most men.

24:06.825 --> 24:09.225
The way she sexualized the story,

24:10.262 --> 24:14.164
bringing up old lovers,
it's almost a reflex.

24:16.435 --> 24:18.062
This plate look
new to you?

24:18.137 --> 24:19.866
There's hardly
a scratch on it.

24:19.972 --> 24:22.031
And the blade,

24:22.107 --> 24:25.565
on the cutting side, it should be
worn down from hitting the bone.

24:28.647 --> 24:32.014
No, this has all been
replaced a couple of weeks ago.

24:36.321 --> 24:40.985
It was here, right here, where
his daughter makes her pastry.

24:43.595 --> 24:45.722
He butchered
his son-in-law.

24:47.332 --> 24:48.856
Blood? You're looking
for blood in a kitchen?

24:48.934 --> 24:52.426
Why don't you just circle the spots
without any blood, it'll save you time.

24:52.504 --> 24:53.801
Those are my knives!
I need those!

24:53.872 --> 24:54.930
So do we.

24:55.007 --> 24:58.443
Tommy, why don't you take
a walk? I'll deal with this.

24:59.778 --> 25:01.143
Why don't you?

25:01.213 --> 25:05.081
All right, come on everybody, you
can finish eating in the dining room.

25:06.852 --> 25:09.650
Excuse me, should we
cancel reservations?

25:09.822 --> 25:11.084
Probably.

25:11.557 --> 25:12.819
What is all this?

25:12.891 --> 25:14.222
Tommy's experiments.

25:14.293 --> 25:16.818
Those are soy dishes.
Soy brülée,

25:16.895 --> 25:19.090
tofu cheesecake,
tofu parmesan...

25:19.498 --> 25:21.796
And the guinea pigs,
the staff?

25:21.867 --> 25:22.891
For the past month.

25:22.968 --> 25:24.993
Only Beatrice had the
nerve to say it was bad.

25:25.070 --> 25:27.664
That sounds out of
character for her.

25:28.207 --> 25:31.370
Things always been tense between
them, even before Josh disappeared?

25:31.443 --> 25:33.707
I know Beatrice wasn't
happy about her new hours.

25:33.779 --> 25:35.542
Tommy changed
her shift?

25:35.614 --> 25:38.048
Three weeks ago,
from 10:00 a. m. To 4:00.

25:38.116 --> 25:39.879
She said she never
got to see Josh.

25:39.952 --> 25:43.217
Maybe you should start making
those cancellation calls now.

25:46.091 --> 25:47.854
New shift.
New food.

25:48.927 --> 25:51.259
Something happened three weeks
ago that set this all in motion.

25:51.330 --> 25:54.060
I guess we start checking
everybody's schedules.

25:56.902 --> 26:00.633
Yes, Josh and Beatrice had an
appointment with me three weeks ago.

26:00.706 --> 26:03.903
But, no, I will not
discuss my patients' health.

26:03.976 --> 26:05.671
Unless you're giving men Pap smears,

26:05.744 --> 26:07.678
Josh wouldn't be
considered a patient.

26:07.746 --> 26:11.147
Actually, many couples come in
together for genetic screening.

26:11.216 --> 26:14.481
If they're planning to start a
family, it's the prudent thing to do

26:14.553 --> 26:16.578
before the wife
goes off the pill.

26:16.655 --> 26:18.646
Well, I can't
comment on that.

26:18.991 --> 26:20.822
No, but did you
comment to Tommy?

26:21.627 --> 26:24.460
Your secretary told us
you're a regular at Trovo.

26:25.998 --> 26:28.296
I have known the family
for over 10 years,

26:28.367 --> 26:30.562
from when Beatrice's mother
was alive.

26:30.636 --> 26:32.536
Tommy treats me
like a king.

26:32.604 --> 26:35.903
Well, then you must've been bursting
to tell him about Beatrice and Josh.

26:35.974 --> 26:38.442
Well, I may
have called him Grandpa.

26:38.510 --> 26:40.102
Three weeks ago?

26:40.579 --> 26:41.671
Sure, okay.

26:45.484 --> 26:47.042
Tell her
I'll be right there.

26:48.320 --> 26:49.912
I love this job.

26:50.789 --> 26:52.757
One more thing.

26:53.425 --> 26:56.656
Soy, tofu, some people think
that it causes infertility.

26:57.129 --> 26:58.255
What do you think?

26:58.330 --> 27:00.730
A new old wives' tale.
Excuse me.

27:02.668 --> 27:04.898
Tommy thought Beatrice
was trying to get pregnant,

27:04.970 --> 27:06.460
he should've
been happy.

27:06.905 --> 27:09.237
Instead he tried
to sabotage her,

27:10.075 --> 27:13.010
by changing her hours,
feeding her soy.

27:14.880 --> 27:18.111
And I can only think of one
reason why a father would do that.

27:18.183 --> 27:20.151
Unfortunately,
so can I.

27:29.594 --> 27:33.155
I was worried you wouldn't
come back. After those cops...

27:34.766 --> 27:36.666
I was
thinking of Josh.

27:37.436 --> 27:42.874
I was thinking of you, not
knowing, not having closure.

27:45.010 --> 27:46.773
It's been two weeks.

27:49.348 --> 27:51.248
Maybe we should
have a ritual.

27:54.219 --> 27:56.278
Would you like
that, baby?

27:57.055 --> 27:58.522
Yes, I would.

28:00.792 --> 28:02.555
All things must end.

28:05.197 --> 28:06.926
What are you saying?

28:15.240 --> 28:17.174
Tommy's kitchen
lit up with blood,

28:17.242 --> 28:19.540
none of it a match
for Josh Mailer.

28:19.611 --> 28:21.044
Between his dinners,
killing Ms. Moore

28:21.113 --> 28:22.978
and his daughter
showing up at 4:00 a. m.,

28:23.048 --> 28:26.643
I don't see how Mr. Onerato even had
the time to butcher his son-in-law.

28:26.718 --> 28:28.185
Half an hour.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.119
The chef that
I talked to said

28:30.188 --> 28:32.884
that's what he'd need to dress a human.

28:33.792 --> 28:37.250
And then another hour to
grind the meat and bones.

28:37.329 --> 28:39.194
Tommy had time.
And motive.

28:39.264 --> 28:40.856
Sexual jealousy?

28:41.933 --> 28:45.164
If he did have an incestuous
relationship with his daughter,

28:45.237 --> 28:48.070
why wasn't his rage
provoked when she married?

28:48.140 --> 28:52.270
Well, that didn't stop her from
being his sexualized little girl.

28:52.344 --> 28:53.675
But motherhood would.

28:53.745 --> 28:56.612
This relationship's all speculation
until someone confirms it.

28:56.681 --> 28:58.581
What about her mother
or siblings?

28:58.650 --> 29:01.744
No siblings. Mother died
when Beatrice was 12.

29:01.820 --> 29:03.117
It was just her and Tommy.

29:03.188 --> 29:04.849
She made the blotter in Connecticut,

29:04.923 --> 29:07.289
when she was 15
for shoplifting.

29:07.359 --> 29:08.849
Gave a home address
in Redding.

29:08.927 --> 29:11.327
Mr. And Mrs. Duke Caldwell.

29:12.330 --> 29:17.029
Tommy's wife tried to hold him
in check, but after she died...

29:17.702 --> 29:19.567
He acted out
a little.

29:20.172 --> 29:23.005
Beatrice needed
parenting, we took her in.

29:23.475 --> 29:27.104
The shoplifting, bad as it
got, or tip of the iceberg?

29:28.213 --> 29:32.513
She was 15, going on 30, going on 5.

29:32.584 --> 29:35.519
I mean, one minute she
was crying like a child,

29:35.587 --> 29:38.021
the next she's trying to seduce Duke.

29:38.090 --> 29:39.557
My wife exaggerates.

29:39.624 --> 29:41.455
My husband enables.

29:42.527 --> 29:45.519
Maybe we should've
let Beatrice stay,

29:45.964 --> 29:49.127
but she was a terrible
influence on our daughter.

29:49.367 --> 29:50.959
Are you late
for something?

29:51.036 --> 29:53.197
Lawyers.
Trovo business.

29:53.271 --> 29:56.001
So when you come to your senses about
Tommy, we'll get the cutting board,

29:56.074 --> 29:57.769
the knives, everything back, right?

29:57.843 --> 29:59.777
Oh. Yeah. Good as new.

29:59.845 --> 30:01.039
Thanks.

30:06.785 --> 30:08.776
That's not an act.

30:08.854 --> 30:11.652
My husband really
thinks Tommy's innocent.

30:11.723 --> 30:15.682
We're more interested in what
you know about Tommy and Beatrice.

30:16.094 --> 30:19.791
You described an
over-sexualized 15-year-old.

30:20.599 --> 30:23.659
Do you think that she
was abused by her father?

30:24.369 --> 30:26.564
Well, I can't
be sure, but...

30:27.873 --> 30:31.570
Tommy wants something,
he can't stop himself.

30:32.978 --> 30:35.105
Even his best
friend's wife?

30:40.385 --> 30:44.253
Please. This is a chance
to help Beatrice now.

30:48.093 --> 30:52.723
Tommy can be dangerous
and fun.

30:54.166 --> 30:56.828
His appetites...
He has no control.

30:57.669 --> 30:59.603
Well, that's why I moved
us up to Connecticut.

30:59.671 --> 31:00.968
He just let go?

31:01.039 --> 31:02.267
No, not quite.

31:06.978 --> 31:12.006
He threw a party for us at
Trovo, got Duke dead drunk,

31:14.052 --> 31:17.351
and after everyone left,

31:19.491 --> 31:22.221
he threw me down on the
counter, face down...

31:22.294 --> 31:25.024
To humiliate you,
before letting you go.

31:25.463 --> 31:28.921
He's one of these guys
you just don't say no to.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.661
Not even Beatrice.

31:32.837 --> 31:34.828
Not even now,
I'm afraid.

31:35.473 --> 31:36.735
Even now.

31:37.375 --> 31:42.210
The abuse, do you think that
their relationship has continued?

31:43.215 --> 31:46.582
Duke said that poor girl's
moving back in with Tommy.

31:48.153 --> 31:51.088
Right back to where she was
before she married Josh.

31:57.229 --> 31:58.821
There's too many
memories here.

31:58.897 --> 32:00.797
I see Josh
everywhere I look.

32:00.865 --> 32:04.232
Aren't there a lot of
memories at your father's loft?

32:05.270 --> 32:07.898
You know, it would be hard to stay here,

32:07.973 --> 32:11.306
'cause, you know, you were
gonna start a family and...

32:11.376 --> 32:13.606
We weren't going
to have children.

32:13.678 --> 32:15.839
You went to your gynecologist together.

32:15.914 --> 32:19.350
Josh was too immature. A
child would've been too much.

32:19.684 --> 32:22.482
I just have to be a
big girl and move on.

32:22.687 --> 32:23.779
Uh...

32:24.723 --> 32:28.090
Move on. You mean,
living with your father,

32:28.159 --> 32:30.389
what you did
before you met Josh?

32:31.429 --> 32:33.522
I won't be
living with him.

32:33.798 --> 32:35.823
He's giving me
his loft.

32:35.900 --> 32:38.425
He's moving in
above the restaurant.

32:39.738 --> 32:42.605
Now, if you don't mind, I should
really be getting ready for work.

32:42.674 --> 32:44.369
Late start,
isn't it?

32:45.610 --> 32:49.273
I'm not the pastry chef
anymore. I work up front now.

32:52.617 --> 32:57.486
That's quite a change, from
sad-eyed widow to queen for a day.

32:59.224 --> 33:02.022
The lawyer meeting
that Duke was going to,

33:02.894 --> 33:05.089
maybe that was
the coronation.

33:09.167 --> 33:12.330
Minskoff. Julie needs
a table for six at 8:30.

33:12.404 --> 33:14.099
We can bump Table 11,
they're tourists. Yeah.

33:14.172 --> 33:15.867
We don't bump
people anymore.

33:15.940 --> 33:18.135
<i>Tell Julie 9:45
or nothing.</i>

33:20.011 --> 33:22.946
Julie, I'm swamped, I'm so
sorry. I don't have any...

33:23.014 --> 33:24.675
Damn it!

33:25.417 --> 33:26.475
Daddy.

33:30.889 --> 33:32.550
Give me your hand.

33:34.059 --> 33:35.924
This won't hurt a bit.

33:43.168 --> 33:45.966
Remember the first time
you told me that?

33:56.981 --> 34:00.849
As of yesterday, Tommy's shares
in his restaurants, cooking show

34:00.919 --> 34:03.717
and real estate were
transferred to Beatrice.

34:03.788 --> 34:07.189
She's the owner of Trovo now,
right down to the last macaroni.

34:07.258 --> 34:09.021
Tommy works for her.

34:09.260 --> 34:11.159
She's blackmailing him.

34:11.896 --> 34:14.295
Ten years' worth
of sexual abuse.

34:14.766 --> 34:16.927
That girl's got a lot
of leverage on her dad.

34:17.001 --> 34:19.833
Without witnesses, it's
"he said, she said. "

34:19.904 --> 34:23.737
Tommy doesn't seem to be the
type to be so easily intimidated.

34:24.743 --> 34:27.109
Well, he isn't. She has
something else on him.

34:27.178 --> 34:29.543
Murder evidence.
That'd scare him.

34:29.614 --> 34:30.774
Playing chicken
with a double-murderer,

34:30.849 --> 34:32.179
not the smartest
thing to do.

34:32.250 --> 34:33.444
We better
put an end to this

34:33.518 --> 34:36.315
before we have a third
murder on our hands.

34:36.388 --> 34:41.121
The grinder that we took
from Trovo's kitchen.

34:42.893 --> 34:46.022
There was a lab report
about abrasions.

34:48.366 --> 34:51.802
"Analysis of the grinding
mechanism revealed recent abrasions

34:51.870 --> 34:55.101
"of unknown origin,
containing traces of titanium,

34:55.172 --> 34:58.904
"and not likely caused by bones
or other organic materials. "

34:59.144 --> 35:01.476
Under the table,
Josh's right leg.

35:02.881 --> 35:05.281
Some kind of metal
brace attached to it.

35:05.350 --> 35:08.080
Yeah, it's from
a compound leg fracture.

35:09.254 --> 35:10.516
He had screws
in his leg.

35:10.588 --> 35:12.180
Those would jam
a kitchen grinder.

35:12.257 --> 35:13.747
If they were still in there
the next morning

35:13.825 --> 35:15.122
when Beatrice
showed up for work,

35:15.193 --> 35:16.285
she might've kept them.

35:16.361 --> 35:19.296
And only realized later
where they came from.

35:19.764 --> 35:22.232
Surgical screws. This is
what she had on her father.

35:22.300 --> 35:23.892
The numbers on those screws
can be traced back

35:23.968 --> 35:25.629
to the patient
who had them.

35:25.703 --> 35:28.672
We need to find out the
hospital that treated Josh.

35:28.740 --> 35:32.608
I don't suppose we can just ask
Beatrice to turn over this evidence.

35:32.677 --> 35:36.044
This is the most leverage
that she's ever had on him.

35:39.517 --> 35:42.452
We need to convince her
that it's worthless.

35:43.555 --> 35:45.682
You can put the saw
on that table.

35:48.059 --> 35:51.825
I have your knives... Oh,
you switched the knife rack.

35:53.598 --> 35:54.792
Smart detective.

35:54.866 --> 35:56.231
It's a little tight
over here.

35:56.301 --> 35:57.996
Is this a permanent
situation?

35:58.069 --> 36:00.799
Until my gypsy heart
tells me otherwise.

36:00.939 --> 36:02.065
I don't
know, Tommy,

36:02.140 --> 36:04.199
hacking up birds,
that kind of prep work...

36:04.275 --> 36:07.574
You know, I used to do that
kind of thing when I was a kid.

36:07.645 --> 36:09.340
I worked at a restaurant
over the summer.

36:12.283 --> 36:13.477
Steamy.

36:14.586 --> 36:16.577
Hey, was this
Beatrice's idea,

36:16.654 --> 36:18.019
you know, now that
she's the boss?

36:18.089 --> 36:19.886
Now what the hell
gave you that idea?

36:19.958 --> 36:22.449
You transferred
your shares to her.

36:29.667 --> 36:31.225
I'm still
the head chef here.

36:31.302 --> 36:33.930
I'm still the reason we're
booked three months in advance.

36:34.005 --> 36:37.304
Well, people come to the
place because of your name.

36:38.176 --> 36:40.235
And Beatrice is
the one that decides,

36:40.311 --> 36:41.539
you know, who gets
the best table now.

36:41.613 --> 36:44.138
I guess that's because she's
the ringmaster now, right?

36:44.215 --> 36:46.775
I thought she should keep
busy, and not dwell on Josh.

36:46.851 --> 36:51.083
Actually, we heard she found
another way to fill her lonely hours.

36:51.155 --> 36:53.521
Duke is a nice
older man,

36:53.591 --> 36:57.357
a father figure for Beatrice
to turn to in her time of need.

36:57.428 --> 36:58.827
Duke and my daughter?

36:59.964 --> 37:02.762
That is a boundary
he would not dare cross.

37:02.834 --> 37:05.894
Even after you threw that
party for him and his wife?

37:05.970 --> 37:08.495
Is this the table
you bent her over?

37:09.507 --> 37:11.475
Come on. You can't
blame old Duke,

37:11.543 --> 37:14.171
but Beatrice, now
that's another story.

37:14.312 --> 37:16.712
Speaking of the lady
of the house...

37:16.781 --> 37:17.770
What's going on?

37:17.849 --> 37:19.817
We're just returning
the things we took.

37:19.884 --> 37:22.785
Oh, I forgot something.
Sorry, the grinder.

37:23.421 --> 37:24.820
Excuse me.

37:24.889 --> 37:27.119
We were admiring your
father's new position.

37:27.191 --> 37:29.284
Hardly room
to boil an egg.

37:30.695 --> 37:31.787
In the old days,

37:31.863 --> 37:35.060
Dad could whip up a
five-course meal on a hot plate.

37:35.133 --> 37:38.569
Not that we'll be taxing
his talents too much anymore.

37:39.437 --> 37:41.632
You know,
I'm just curious,

37:42.206 --> 37:44.265
your husband, did he ever
have a motorcycle accident,

37:44.342 --> 37:46.276
you know, maybe
break his leg?

37:46.344 --> 37:48.073
Yes. Before we met.

37:48.146 --> 37:51.445
Did he have any pins
or screws in his leg?

37:52.784 --> 37:55.412
Yeah. He did.

37:56.421 --> 37:59.322
He was always in a lot of pain
when the temperature dropped.

37:59.390 --> 38:00.550
Why do you ask?

38:01.092 --> 38:05.654
Our lab found nicks in the
mechanism here, you know,

38:06.431 --> 38:09.628
new ones, titanium residue.
Anyway, it's all scientific.

38:09.701 --> 38:11.726
They might've been
caused by surgical screws

38:11.803 --> 38:12.929
getting caught
in the machine,

38:13.004 --> 38:15.700
when Josh's bones
were being ground up.

38:16.140 --> 38:17.573
That's an
insane thought.

38:17.642 --> 38:20.702
Still, you know,
we have to ask.

38:21.212 --> 38:24.807
So did you happen to
find any little screws

38:24.882 --> 38:27.578
when you came into work
Tuesday morning?

38:29.621 --> 38:34.251
If I did, that would mean that my
father killed Josh, wouldn't it?

38:34.325 --> 38:35.849
It sure would.

38:39.530 --> 38:42.829
I didn't find anything.
But it's a big kitchen.

38:43.534 --> 38:46.901
They might still show up
if he was really killed here.

38:46.971 --> 38:49.303
Well, if somebody
did find the screws,

38:49.374 --> 38:52.036
it would be hard to prove
that they were Josh's.

38:52.110 --> 38:55.204
Josh told me once that
they had numbers on them.

38:55.480 --> 38:57.414
That's true.
If there's ever a recall,

38:57.482 --> 38:59.643
they need a way
to trace them.

38:59.717 --> 39:02.447
Except Josh's hospital
had a computer meltdown,

39:02.520 --> 39:05.284
and the record of
those numbers is gone.

39:07.959 --> 39:12.293
Even if we had the screws, there's
no way to prove they came from Josh.

39:16.334 --> 39:21.237
In other words, whoever killed
Josh caught a lucky break.

39:33.551 --> 39:35.883
Look, we know it's hard for you to hear.

39:35.953 --> 39:38.012
You didn't finish cutting up your ducks.

39:38.089 --> 39:40.148
Aldo can finish
cutting the ducks.

39:40.224 --> 39:41.384
You've upset my daughter enough.

39:41.459 --> 39:42.892
It's time for you to leave.

39:42.960 --> 39:47.226
She doesn't look upset, so
much as scared. Scared of you.

39:48.066 --> 39:50.591
You weren't scared
five minutes ago.

39:50.902 --> 39:53.166
Is it because
you felt protected?

39:53.237 --> 39:55.137
You have something
on him, don't you?

39:55.206 --> 39:56.264
She doesn't
have anything.

39:56.340 --> 39:58.171
The screws,
you found them.

39:59.510 --> 40:01.171
You used those screws
against him,

40:01.245 --> 40:03.145
to strip him of the power
that he has over you.

40:03.214 --> 40:05.614
I gave her the responsibility
to help her deal with the grief.

40:05.683 --> 40:08.117
It was a mistake
and now it's over.

40:08.186 --> 40:10.017
How are you going to protect
yourself from him now?

40:10.088 --> 40:12.079
She doesn't have
anything to fear from me.

40:12.156 --> 40:15.057
When you told him
that you found the screws,

40:15.626 --> 40:17.389
how did he explain
killing Josh?

40:17.462 --> 40:19.589
Beatrice, go upstairs,
I'll deal with them.

40:19.664 --> 40:20.926
Did he say
it was self-defense?

40:20.998 --> 40:24.126
Did he say Josh was so
enraged by your father's prank,

40:24.202 --> 40:27.103
that after killing Sally
Moore, Josh came after him?

40:27.171 --> 40:28.695
That your dad
had no choice.

40:28.773 --> 40:30.832
No, that's the story that
you would want to believe.

40:30.908 --> 40:34.105
But that's not the real
reason that he killed Josh.

40:35.346 --> 40:38.975
It's the same reason he
drove away your other lovers,

40:40.418 --> 40:42.409
so that he wouldn't lose
his special little girl.

40:42.487 --> 40:45.354
We know what he did to you,
Beatrice, we know about the abuse.

40:45.423 --> 40:47.482
There is no such thing.
These people are monsters.

40:47.558 --> 40:49.185
Tell them, Beatrice.

40:49.260 --> 40:51.387
I don't know what
you're talking about.

40:51.462 --> 40:53.123
You can't deny it.

40:55.466 --> 40:59.129
And you can't admit it, so
what? So you just go numb?

40:59.203 --> 41:02.172
Well, that's not
a safe place anymore.

41:02.240 --> 41:03.969
Beatrice, your father
is an ogre,

41:04.041 --> 41:08.478
he consumes everything,
his friends, wives, Josh...

41:08.546 --> 41:09.604
These are all lies!

41:09.680 --> 41:10.840
He can't help himself!

41:12.016 --> 41:16.043
He will destroy the promise
of your future happiness.

41:17.555 --> 41:20.581
A child that you want for
your own, your own child.

41:20.658 --> 41:23.024
He will take that from you
to keep from losing you.

41:23.094 --> 41:27.087
Your doctor told him you and Josh
were trying to start a family.

41:27.165 --> 41:29.133
So he tried to stop you
from getting pregnant,

41:29.200 --> 41:33.193
by feeding you soy, by changing your
hours, so you couldn't see Josh...

41:33.271 --> 41:34.431
These are fairy tales.

41:34.505 --> 41:36.234
And then he realized
a better way to do it,

41:36.307 --> 41:39.037
to keep you and Josh
apart forever,

41:39.110 --> 41:42.136
by making Josh look like a
murderer, and then killing him.

41:42.213 --> 41:43.703
That's absurd!

41:46.350 --> 41:49.808
Oh, Daddy,
how could you?

41:51.756 --> 41:53.621
We just wanted a baby.

41:54.125 --> 41:55.558
What would you
want with a baby?

41:55.626 --> 41:58.595
Kids just ruin everything.
I could've told you that.

41:58.663 --> 42:00.255
Oh, there it is.

42:00.898 --> 42:02.525
That's the truth.

42:02.867 --> 42:04.835
It was never
about love.

42:06.470 --> 42:09.064
Now the truth is the only
thing that can protect you now.

42:09.140 --> 42:11.734
Beatrice, the screws,
where are they?

42:12.610 --> 42:14.100
But you said that...

42:15.146 --> 42:16.943
Where'd you put them?

42:20.151 --> 42:22.119
I'm all you've got, baby.

42:28.793 --> 42:31.626
It's not going to prove
anything. You can't trace them.

42:31.696 --> 42:35.154
Well, look what I found, a
copy of the hospital record.

42:45.142 --> 42:46.234
The numbers match.

42:46.310 --> 42:47.538
Honey...

42:49.747 --> 42:51.510
You're under arrest.

42:52.483 --> 42:56.044
Honey, look what you've done!
Now you don't have anybody!

42:57.221 --> 42:59.314
No one will want you
after they know.

42:59.390 --> 43:01.290
You've ruined yourself.

43:02.660 --> 43:04.525
How could you
do this to me?

43:04.595 --> 43:06.358
How could you do it?

43:07.832 --> 43:11.734
Gluttony. Now I know why it made
the short list of deadly sins.
