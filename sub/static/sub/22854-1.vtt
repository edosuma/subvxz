01:16.083 --> 01:17.041
Here.

01:55.166 --> 01:56.166
No, not now.

02:13.833 --> 02:14.875
Evening.

02:15.041 --> 02:16.125
It's late.

02:17.708 --> 02:18.916
Mr. Rabascall.

02:23.166 --> 02:25.041
How's this? Not too gaudy?

02:26.041 --> 02:27.166
It's nice.

02:33.333 --> 02:35.458
- Where are you from?
- La Ciotat.

02:35.625 --> 02:37.083
On the coast?

02:39.125 --> 02:40.625
You know Lyon, ma'am?

02:40.791 --> 02:41.625
No.

02:42.291 --> 02:44.000
Is the Conservatory far?

02:44.166 --> 02:45.166
Over the bridge

02:45.333 --> 02:46.750
and we're there.

02:50.375 --> 02:51.791
It's like a competition?

02:51.958 --> 02:53.500
Yes, for young pianists.

02:54.958 --> 02:56.416
From all over France.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.000
What's he doing?

03:20.458 --> 03:21.875
Glazier!

03:30.333 --> 03:31.375
Wait!

03:40.208 --> 03:41.500
You take him.

03:42.666 --> 03:43.791
I'll see you there.

03:43.958 --> 03:44.708
Go!

03:48.333 --> 03:49.250
Go!

03:50.416 --> 03:51.458
Drive.

04:42.625 --> 04:44.500
<i>Mr. Sauvage - 1st floor</i>

05:57.916 --> 05:58.875
Hello.

06:01.250 --> 06:02.500
Hello, Gabrielle.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.208
Take a seat.

06:11.750 --> 06:13.625
Take a seat while I finish up.

06:19.708 --> 06:21.833
You received
your correspondence classes?

06:22.000 --> 06:22.916
Yes.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.416
History bores me.

06:26.833 --> 06:28.791
You'll keep at it, won't you?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.916
I don't like learning that way.

06:31.583 --> 06:33.083
I want to be talked to.

06:33.791 --> 06:35.041
I have your book.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.333
Thanks.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.166
You're hot.

06:59.416 --> 07:00.875
It's a superb novel.

07:01.666 --> 07:05.166
Written by a young Englishwoman
who never left the countryside.

07:05.333 --> 07:07.541
- Where she lived...
- She never left?

07:09.291 --> 07:10.500
She died young.

07:18.250 --> 07:19.708
Beautiful handwriting.

07:29.833 --> 07:30.958
Go on.

07:47.583 --> 07:49.583
You had something to tell me?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.041
No.

09:34.666 --> 09:37.500
<i>This book belongs to Jean-Claude...</i>

09:58.875 --> 10:00.500
<i>We'll be naked.</i>

10:01.458 --> 10:03.291
<i>I'll lie on top of you.</i>

10:03.458 --> 10:05.333
<i>I'll spread your arms out.</i>

10:06.291 --> 10:10.208
<i>You will know with me
the principal thing.</i>

10:11.416 --> 10:12.875
<i>You will enter into me.</i>

10:14.208 --> 10:15.916
<i>You will enter into me.</i>

10:29.541 --> 10:32.750
So, Mrs. Savourney,
happy with the harvest?

10:32.916 --> 10:34.250
Better than last year.

10:34.416 --> 10:35.958
What's your yield per hectare?

10:36.125 --> 10:37.625
15-16.

10:38.125 --> 10:41.083
This year, the flower's good and dry.
Top quality.

10:47.125 --> 10:48.416
Come along!

10:49.250 --> 10:51.875
Good evening. Sit down with us.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.625
To next year!

12:35.666 --> 12:36.458
Here I am.

12:38.875 --> 12:39.750
Good evening.

12:44.041 --> 12:45.500
You liked the book?

12:45.666 --> 12:46.666
Yes.

12:47.208 --> 12:48.708
It's a book of love.

12:49.666 --> 12:51.166
Yes, a love story.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.125
This is for you.

12:55.666 --> 12:56.750
What is it?

12:56.916 --> 12:58.625
Take it. It's for you.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.708
I didn't read that.

13:25.166 --> 13:26.333
It's for you.

13:26.500 --> 13:27.625
Who wrote it?

13:28.333 --> 13:29.333
Me.

13:29.541 --> 13:31.500
Where'd you come up with that?

13:33.583 --> 13:34.708
It's me.

13:35.333 --> 13:36.791
Those words. You're mad.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.791
You gave me the book.

13:39.958 --> 13:41.416
It's a book.

13:42.208 --> 13:43.500
- Goodnight.
- Not goodnight.

13:44.208 --> 13:46.500
Not goodnight.
Where are you going?

13:52.958 --> 13:54.541
You're a nothing.

14:08.708 --> 14:10.791
What are you all staring at?

14:35.583 --> 14:36.708
Gabrielle!

15:17.666 --> 15:19.291
Come here, my girl.

15:27.666 --> 15:28.708
Open up.

15:35.541 --> 15:36.958
Come out of there!

15:50.333 --> 15:51.416
You'll be hungry.

17:16.375 --> 17:17.958
You're not happy at home?

17:21.500 --> 17:22.415
I am.

17:24.208 --> 17:26.125
Would you like some time away?

17:26.290 --> 17:27.333
No, why?

17:30.416 --> 17:32.541
There are places for...

17:51.500 --> 17:54.000
She gets these cramps.
She'll be fine.

17:56.125 --> 17:58.458
With her,
you never know if it's an act.

18:11.666 --> 18:12.708
Better?

18:14.666 --> 18:15.708
Better.

18:18.041 --> 18:19.125
Well...

18:19.833 --> 18:22.333
We'll be seeing each other again.

18:23.541 --> 18:24.625
What for?

18:42.291 --> 18:43.583
And you?

18:46.666 --> 18:47.958
Do you hear me?

18:51.083 --> 18:52.375
You're there.

18:54.666 --> 18:56.125
You're naked.

18:59.625 --> 19:01.666
Give me the principal thing.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.250
Or let me die.

20:28.916 --> 20:30.750
Hello, José. I'd like a word.

20:45.666 --> 20:46.958
Do you want to go...

20:47.125 --> 20:48.333
No, here's fine.

20:49.083 --> 20:50.375
Have a seat.

20:53.541 --> 20:54.708
Thank you.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.291
Well, José...

21:06.125 --> 21:08.416
I was thinking,
you have a tiring life.

21:08.583 --> 21:11.250
Always moving on.
Maybe you're sick of it.

21:15.833 --> 21:17.791
I don't beat around the bush.

21:17.958 --> 21:19.041
My daughter...

21:20.041 --> 21:22.041
You've met my eldest daughter?

21:24.083 --> 21:25.791
I sense you're not indifferent.

21:29.291 --> 21:30.625
She's beautiful.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.541
There comes a time
to start a family.

21:42.916 --> 21:43.750
I won't lie.

21:43.916 --> 21:45.833
She's ill. It's her nerves.

21:46.416 --> 21:47.666
She has

21:47.958 --> 21:49.583
her head in the clouds.

21:50.333 --> 21:51.583
She's not mad.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.750
Don't believe the gossips.

21:54.250 --> 21:56.250
She needs a man in her life.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.750
A husband.

21:59.291 --> 22:00.708
I hardly know you.

22:01.875 --> 22:04.166
But you seem the solid type.

22:04.916 --> 22:05.875
But she...

22:08.583 --> 22:09.791
Has she seen me?

22:10.041 --> 22:11.208
She will.

22:11.375 --> 22:12.625
You're Catholic.

22:13.083 --> 22:15.958
I have no religion.
I have nothing, ma'am.

22:16.916 --> 22:18.416
Nothing to call my own.

22:18.583 --> 22:19.750
I know.

22:20.083 --> 22:21.666
But you have a profession.

22:21.833 --> 22:24.125
We could help set you up in business.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.041
You're a bricklayer by trade.

22:30.250 --> 22:31.708
Think it over.

22:42.250 --> 22:43.875
What does the guy want?

22:47.541 --> 22:48.666
Guess.

22:52.125 --> 22:53.500
I don't understand.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.083
He wants to marry.

23:00.125 --> 23:01.375
Marry who?

23:14.625 --> 23:15.375
Let go!

23:21.000 --> 23:22.791
When our village was taken,

23:22.958 --> 23:26.958
a few of us escaped
and hid in the mountains.

23:27.750 --> 23:29.958
We laid low for several days.

23:30.666 --> 23:32.791
Franco's men arrived

23:33.208 --> 23:37.458
and that was the end of the war.
I'd fought with the Republicans.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.875
I couldn't stay.

23:43.083 --> 23:44.416
We waited for...

23:50.166 --> 23:52.250
We waited for help to come.

23:53.125 --> 23:55.750
After a while,
we had no choice, we left.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.750
That was the last time I saw my village.

23:58.916 --> 24:00.083
In flames.

24:00.791 --> 24:03.416
Do you have any news of your family?

24:04.375 --> 24:07.791
My older brother
went to live in Zaragoza.

24:08.750 --> 24:10.458
We've stopped writing.

24:12.291 --> 24:14.250
We passed through La Ciotat.

24:14.916 --> 24:16.500
Those big shipyards.

24:16.666 --> 24:18.708
José's going to work down there.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.833
It's full of communists.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.708
It's sad when events divide families,

24:25.875 --> 24:28.791
turn cousins and neighbors
against each other.

24:28.958 --> 24:31.000
We had that here not so long ago.

24:36.375 --> 24:39.250
Would you like to live
by the sea, Gabrielle?

24:40.541 --> 24:41.583
What?

24:43.083 --> 24:44.750
What are we celebrating?

25:11.166 --> 25:12.958
You want to marry me?

25:14.541 --> 25:15.750
You're mad.

25:20.291 --> 25:21.500
We're strangers.

25:21.666 --> 25:23.000
You're a stranger.

25:24.875 --> 25:26.541
I don't even know your name.

25:30.333 --> 25:31.583
I forgot.

25:35.041 --> 25:37.041
You're playing along with it.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.208
They want to be rid of me.

25:49.041 --> 25:50.750
They've bought you off.

25:53.125 --> 25:54.625
Goodbye, miss.

26:05.833 --> 26:06.875
Adèle, leave her!

26:07.041 --> 26:08.125
Let me be!

26:09.625 --> 26:11.625
I won't hesitate, Gabrielle.

26:12.708 --> 26:14.833
I'll have you interned in Marseille.

26:52.583 --> 26:53.708
Hello.

26:57.125 --> 26:58.666
I won't sleep with you.

27:00.125 --> 27:01.125
Fine.

27:04.916 --> 27:06.375
What will you do?

27:08.625 --> 27:09.833
There are women.

27:11.875 --> 27:12.958
Where?

27:13.541 --> 27:14.833
Where we'll be.

27:28.041 --> 27:29.333
You'll be unhappy.

27:31.458 --> 27:32.958
Why choose to be unhappy?

27:36.000 --> 27:37.416
I don't love you.

27:38.583 --> 27:40.083
I'll never love you.

27:42.833 --> 27:44.541
I don't love you either.

28:02.458 --> 28:04.916
He told mom he'd take communion.

28:10.875 --> 28:12.250
What's wrong with you?

28:13.750 --> 28:15.666
You have too much makeup on.

28:16.208 --> 28:17.833
Come down. We're waiting.

30:53.875 --> 30:55.041
Goodnight.

30:55.208 --> 30:56.458
Goodnight.

31:59.541 --> 32:00.833
Are you awake?

32:01.750 --> 32:03.833
This week, I'm staying in bed.

32:05.166 --> 32:07.000
I don't want to be disturbed.

32:45.333 --> 32:47.583
<i>J. RABASCALL
Building Contractors</i>

32:51.000 --> 32:52.875
- Mrs. Rabascall.
- Morning.

32:56.625 --> 32:57.833
Hello.

32:59.041 --> 33:01.958
Yes, ma'am,
but we need to do a quote first.

33:03.750 --> 33:05.083
I didn't catch that.

33:05.250 --> 33:08.625
For the construction
or renovation of one wing?

33:10.416 --> 33:12.375
I'll be at the site on Rue du Cap.

33:12.541 --> 33:15.000
Anyone asks for me,
please send them over.

33:15.500 --> 33:16.458
Yes?

33:18.916 --> 33:20.250
You'll call back?

33:20.416 --> 33:21.500
Thank you.

33:39.625 --> 33:41.750
You'd like a drink before dinner?

33:42.625 --> 33:43.375
Yes.

34:05.208 --> 34:07.250
You're going to Toulon tonight?

34:07.875 --> 34:08.958
Yes.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.666
Because it's Saturday.

34:18.750 --> 34:20.875
Those women,
what do they do for you?

34:21.583 --> 34:23.375
You don't talk about it.

34:26.125 --> 34:27.458
Tell me.

34:28.583 --> 34:31.208
We spend some time together.
They know.

34:32.125 --> 34:33.750
It happens.

34:36.875 --> 34:38.708
Doesn't sound very complicated.

34:40.166 --> 34:41.541
Do you pay them for it?

34:41.708 --> 34:42.583
Of course.

34:42.750 --> 34:43.958
How much?

34:44.500 --> 34:46.083
You want to know?

34:46.791 --> 34:48.125
200 francs.

35:37.250 --> 35:39.208
Put the money on the table.

38:57.250 --> 38:58.166
José!

38:59.166 --> 39:00.333
Okay?

39:07.291 --> 39:08.833
Well, Mrs. Rabascall?

39:09.000 --> 39:10.208
Like it?

39:10.375 --> 39:11.291
Yes.

39:51.833 --> 39:53.000
What's wrong?

39:58.666 --> 40:00.875
You had no idea you were pregnant?

40:01.500 --> 40:02.833
No, no idea.

40:04.125 --> 40:06.833
After your attack, you lost the child.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Did they tell you at the clinic?

40:09.333 --> 40:10.458
Yes.

40:11.291 --> 40:13.125
You risk losing any others.

40:13.625 --> 40:17.125
Your affliction
shows up on the abdominal X-ray.

40:17.291 --> 40:18.125
You'll see.

40:21.250 --> 40:23.166
You see these light spots?

40:26.291 --> 40:27.083
Good morning.

40:27.333 --> 40:28.583
Take a seat.

40:29.208 --> 40:31.458
This one's as big as a hazelnut.

40:32.125 --> 40:34.541
People call it stones sickness.

40:35.083 --> 40:36.916
I was telling your wife,

40:37.083 --> 40:40.750
one option is a lombotomy.
but it's a long, delicate operation

40:40.958 --> 40:43.166
that leaves significant scarring.

40:43.416 --> 40:45.166
The first step I recommend

40:45.333 --> 40:46.791
is a spa cure.

40:48.333 --> 40:51.125
There are specialist establishments.
I have a list

40:51.291 --> 40:52.458
in France.

40:52.625 --> 40:54.666
Or Switzerland, but it's expensive.

40:54.833 --> 40:56.041
We'll manage.

40:56.208 --> 40:57.250
No.

40:58.583 --> 40:59.625
No?

41:00.250 --> 41:01.791
You won't take a cure?

41:03.541 --> 41:05.458
If you want to have a child...

41:07.041 --> 41:09.208
- You want to have a child?
- Yes.

41:09.750 --> 41:11.458
You want to have a child.

41:16.291 --> 41:17.500
We'll go.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.000
It's sad here.

42:40.416 --> 42:41.916
Mrs. Rabascall, Gabrielle.

42:42.083 --> 42:43.625
Booked in for six weeks.

42:43.958 --> 42:45.083
Six weeks?

42:45.250 --> 42:46.000
Yes.

42:46.166 --> 42:47.833
I'll get you your key.

42:49.541 --> 42:52.458
Lower ground floor,
first corridor on the left.

42:52.625 --> 42:53.625
Thanks.

43:01.375 --> 43:02.875
I'll come to see you.

43:03.625 --> 43:05.041
Don't I get a goodbye?

43:06.583 --> 43:07.416
Goodbye.

43:08.916 --> 43:11.041
You'll be happy on your own.

44:08.375 --> 44:11.708
You must respect the exact times
for taking the waters.

44:11.875 --> 44:14.041
Same goes for balneotherapy.

44:14.208 --> 44:15.708
Above all,

44:15.875 --> 44:18.375
all day long,
drink lots of water.

44:18.541 --> 44:21.666
The calculus may dissolve
and you'll feel better...

44:21.833 --> 44:23.500
What if I don't want to?

44:57.125 --> 44:58.541
You've worked here long?

45:00.083 --> 45:01.083
Four years.

45:01.458 --> 45:02.583
Where are you from?

45:03.041 --> 45:03.833
Provence.

45:04.375 --> 45:07.416
Saint-Etienne-de-Tinée.
Near Péone.

45:07.583 --> 45:09.166
I'm from Bargemon.

45:13.708 --> 45:14.791
Agostine.

45:15.416 --> 45:16.583
Gabrielle.

45:17.083 --> 45:18.708
I haven't been back for ages.

45:18.875 --> 45:21.958
On vacations,
I go to see my daughter near Paris.

45:22.125 --> 45:23.416
Coffee perhaps?

45:23.583 --> 45:24.458
Yes.

45:31.958 --> 45:33.500
All the meals are here?

45:34.375 --> 45:36.291
Yes. We don't do room service.

45:36.458 --> 45:38.625
Except for bedridden patients.

45:40.625 --> 45:42.125
Don't you like it here?

45:45.250 --> 45:46.541
What's wrong?

45:49.583 --> 45:50.666
I'm fine.

45:53.416 --> 45:54.916
Mrs. Rabascall.

46:57.375 --> 46:58.583
Can I help?

46:58.875 --> 46:59.708
'Course not.

46:59.875 --> 47:01.791
Why? Are you bored downstairs?

47:54.125 --> 47:55.541
I wasn't married.

47:56.500 --> 47:59.083
She's raised by good, upright folk.

48:00.208 --> 48:03.791
I'm allowed to visit twice a year.
Holidays, Christmas...

48:07.041 --> 48:08.250
How old is she?

48:08.958 --> 48:10.708
She'll be six years old

48:10.875 --> 48:12.583
on November 18th.

48:13.166 --> 48:14.916
She's blonde, like her father.

48:20.125 --> 48:21.916
Beautiful from here, isn't it?

48:24.250 --> 48:25.791
This floor's for the rich.

48:33.875 --> 48:34.958
Come in.

48:36.583 --> 48:38.416
You'll tag along every day?

48:39.833 --> 48:41.000
Morning, Mr. Sauvage.

48:41.166 --> 48:42.666
Morning, Agostine.

48:44.416 --> 48:46.375
The shower down the hall is cold.

48:46.541 --> 48:47.416
I know.

48:47.625 --> 48:49.875
Unless you're in there before 8 a.m.

48:50.541 --> 48:52.500
Pass me my newspaper, Agostine.

48:56.750 --> 48:58.041
I'd like to shave.

48:58.208 --> 48:59.791
I'll fetch some hot water.

49:04.416 --> 49:05.541
Hello.

49:06.458 --> 49:07.708
You work with Agostine?

49:08.416 --> 49:09.416
No.

49:09.708 --> 49:11.083
I'm taking a cure.

49:13.208 --> 49:14.791
I never go downstairs.

49:15.625 --> 49:17.541
Only sick people down there.

49:20.333 --> 49:21.416
Tell me...

49:32.500 --> 49:34.416
The elderly gentleman next door,

49:34.583 --> 49:36.833
I don't see him or hear him anymore.

49:38.083 --> 49:39.791
Do you mind taking a look?

50:02.375 --> 50:03.541
Nobody.

50:04.833 --> 50:06.291
I thought as much.

50:07.291 --> 50:09.541
They take them to Lyon to croak.

50:13.291 --> 50:16.083
- Would you like me to do it, sir?
- Yes, please.

50:16.541 --> 50:18.125
The razor and soap

50:18.291 --> 50:19.791
are on the sink.

50:26.583 --> 50:27.666
He's a lieutenant.

50:27.958 --> 50:29.625
Served in Indochina.

50:29.791 --> 50:32.958
His father's a general,
or colonel or something.

50:33.875 --> 50:36.875
He got something nasty there.
With only one kidney...

50:38.291 --> 50:40.291
He has attacks, called uremia.

50:40.958 --> 50:42.791
Sometimes he's in terrible pain.

50:43.291 --> 50:44.708
He never complains.

50:45.666 --> 50:47.125
We give him morphine.

50:47.291 --> 50:49.791
He goes woozy, smiling like a baby.

50:55.291 --> 50:56.541
Will he die?

50:56.708 --> 50:58.875
The Good Lord's a louse that way.

51:00.041 --> 51:01.458
He has visitors?

51:01.625 --> 51:03.541
No wife, no kids, he told me.

51:08.208 --> 51:09.666
I have to go.

51:47.833 --> 51:48.916
Come in.

51:54.625 --> 51:56.666
We're going to lose this war.

51:58.583 --> 52:00.625
You were over there a long time?

52:03.458 --> 52:04.375
A few months.

52:04.583 --> 52:07.250
The young man just now,
was he with you?

52:08.250 --> 52:09.666
He's my orderly.

52:09.833 --> 52:11.291
He brought me the papers.

52:12.375 --> 52:13.958
At age 2, he was baptized,

52:14.375 --> 52:15.666
Christianized...

52:16.666 --> 52:20.000
We renamed him Blaise,
made him a French soldier.

52:20.750 --> 52:22.083
Were we right?

52:22.833 --> 52:24.916
I never saw a Chinaman before.

52:28.541 --> 52:30.833
You think there'll always be wars?

52:31.583 --> 52:33.750
The true life of men before death.

52:34.791 --> 52:36.083
Or so they say.

52:36.541 --> 52:37.958
Do you miss it?

52:38.625 --> 52:41.458
I was born into it.
It's been my whole life.

52:41.625 --> 52:43.333
I miss my comrades.

52:45.916 --> 52:47.375
Is that medication?

52:48.416 --> 52:49.875
No, it's opium.

52:50.458 --> 52:52.166
Blaise brought it.

52:53.958 --> 52:57.375
By chewing it like this,
you don't stray too far.

52:59.333 --> 53:00.916
It soothes the pain.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Have you worked here long?

53:37.541 --> 53:39.416
No, I told you, I'm...

53:42.333 --> 53:44.041
What have you got?

53:45.666 --> 53:47.166
Stones sickness.

53:52.500 --> 53:53.875
Stones.

54:12.208 --> 54:13.666
<i>On Happiness</i>

54:15.375 --> 54:17.958
<i>André Sauvage
26 rue Commines, Lyon</i>

55:02.125 --> 55:03.375
Ladies and gentlemen,

55:03.541 --> 55:05.000
your 4 o'clock waters.

55:22.541 --> 55:25.750
Mr. Green, Mrs. Schneider, Mr. Cabetti,

55:25.916 --> 55:28.583
Mrs. Rabascall, Mr. Hartmann...

55:34.458 --> 55:35.791
You're out of bed?

55:39.125 --> 55:40.666
Dodging your warm water?

55:41.083 --> 55:42.541
You don't believe in it?

55:42.708 --> 55:43.708
No.

55:44.583 --> 55:46.041
What are you playing?

55:46.250 --> 55:48.833
<i>June Barcarolle by Tchaikovsky.</i>

55:49.833 --> 55:51.291
You play an instrument?

55:51.458 --> 55:52.375
The piano.

55:52.541 --> 55:53.791
A little.

55:53.958 --> 55:55.000
Badly.

56:33.291 --> 56:34.916
Why am I so tired?

56:37.916 --> 56:38.916
Lieutenant!

56:46.958 --> 56:48.375
I'm sorry.

57:25.708 --> 57:26.750
No wedding ring?

57:31.333 --> 57:32.541
I took it off.

57:33.500 --> 57:36.541
With the showers and treatments,
it's easy to lose.

57:37.041 --> 57:38.500
Rabascall?

57:38.750 --> 57:39.958
Is that Catalan?

57:40.125 --> 57:41.875
Yes, I've never been there.

57:50.708 --> 57:52.333
What are you exactly?

57:53.458 --> 57:54.875
A hospital visitor?

57:55.458 --> 57:57.166
You're feeling better today.

58:00.333 --> 58:01.666
I die cured.

58:15.250 --> 58:18.125
I wonder where that goes.
The forest, I suppose.

58:18.583 --> 58:20.333
We can go for walks.

58:21.625 --> 58:23.250
When you're feeling better.

58:26.083 --> 58:28.291
Perhaps the room needs airing.

58:32.208 --> 58:33.458
It must stink.

58:34.916 --> 58:36.166
I smell nothing.

58:44.541 --> 58:46.583
Is that the book you're reading?

58:47.958 --> 58:50.458
I've finished it. I'll lend it to you.

58:52.291 --> 58:54.833
When people lend me books,
it ends badly.

58:55.375 --> 58:57.000
So I'll give it to you.

59:04.125 --> 59:05.791
You have slender hands.

59:08.291 --> 59:10.083
I'm tired now.

59:37.375 --> 59:39.833
Mrs. Rabascall,
your husband is here.

59:46.916 --> 59:49.083
- You told me you were coming?
- Yes.

59:50.500 --> 59:52.291
I drove it without a break.

59:54.208 --> 59:56.833
- When are you leaving again?
- Early tomorrow.

59:58.833 --> 01:00:00.500
You can't sleep here.

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:03.041
I'm staying in the village.

01:00:03.416 --> 01:00:05.625
The guesthouse for one night is fine.

01:00:08.416 --> 01:00:09.750
You're not eating?

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:18.916
How are things down there?

01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:21.250
We have orders coming in.

01:00:21.416 --> 01:00:23.375
They're building in Lavandou.

01:00:24.833 --> 01:00:27.583
The house will be ready
when you get home.

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:29.500
I got a refrigerator,

01:00:29.666 --> 01:00:31.125
the big model we saw.

01:00:31.875 --> 01:00:33.000
Morning, sir.

01:00:33.666 --> 01:00:35.500
You left this upstairs.

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:42.333
Every time you come, it rains.

01:00:50.125 --> 01:00:51.416
People are right.

01:00:51.625 --> 01:00:52.833
What?

01:00:54.416 --> 01:00:55.833
You're mean.

01:01:00.416 --> 01:01:01.666
Who says that?

01:01:06.625 --> 01:01:08.041
It's stopped.

01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:10.500
The weather's fickle here.

01:01:11.291 --> 01:01:12.625
I'm going for a smoke.

01:01:25.875 --> 01:01:27.333
Nice man, your husband.

01:01:27.625 --> 01:01:29.583
What have you got against him?

01:03:49.583 --> 01:03:50.708
Thank you.

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:08.000
<i>Indochina
Vietnamese forces advance on Son-Tay</i>

01:06:28.916 --> 01:06:30.125
You must eat now.

01:06:32.708 --> 01:06:34.000
You feel better?

01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:37.958
How long was I in bed?

01:06:38.916 --> 01:06:40.083
Three days.

01:06:41.041 --> 01:06:42.291
You're pale.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.458
Where's Agostine?

01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:47.083
She's not here.

01:06:48.791 --> 01:06:49.958
In the kitchens?

01:06:50.125 --> 01:06:52.625
No, she's taken a few days off.

01:07:52.458 --> 01:07:53.875
But I thought...

01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:57.750
I was told
you wouldn't come back.

01:07:58.833 --> 01:08:01.250
They treated me in Lyon,
at the hospital.

01:08:01.458 --> 01:08:03.750
A transfusion or something like that.

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.083
Change your blood,
get you back on your feet.

01:08:08.833 --> 01:08:10.333
I wanted to see you.

01:08:13.166 --> 01:08:15.000
My father's home from a mission.

01:08:15.666 --> 01:08:19.375
I have a beautiful new room.
West Pavilion, room 112.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.457
You wanted to see me?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.832
I thought of our moments together.

01:08:43.166 --> 01:08:44.957
You were there with me.

01:08:47.082 --> 01:08:48.207
Me?

01:08:50.832 --> 01:08:52.125
Excuse me.

01:08:53.125 --> 01:08:54.541
Time for my treatment.

01:09:26.166 --> 01:09:28.375
So your father got you this room?

01:09:29.416 --> 01:09:30.500
Yes.

01:09:31.416 --> 01:09:32.707
I think he pulled strings

01:09:32.875 --> 01:09:34.750
when he found out I was ill.

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:39.416
We hadn't spoken for six months.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.416
We don't always see eye to eye.

01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:46.375
We never see eye to eye, in fact.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.582
You don't have to agree
with your parents.

01:09:52.916 --> 01:09:54.666
Mine say that I'm crazy.

01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:57.291
So they locked you up here?

01:10:21.833 --> 01:10:23.875
The photographer's here today.

01:10:28.333 --> 01:10:30.583
Do you want him
to take a photo of us?

01:10:36.416 --> 01:10:38.333
Ma'am, eyes this way, please.

01:10:42.666 --> 01:10:44.458
Perfect! Don't move.

01:10:45.958 --> 01:10:47.541
Very good, thank you.

01:11:02.541 --> 01:11:05.416
I was at boarding school,
military academy...

01:11:07.583 --> 01:11:09.583
I've always lived among men.

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:13.458
Not counting nurses with crepe soles.

01:11:14.958 --> 01:11:17.041
Or whores in Saigon or Dalat.

01:11:24.833 --> 01:11:26.666
So I'll be the first.

01:11:32.416 --> 01:11:33.416
Stop.

01:11:39.125 --> 01:11:40.958
You're married, Gabrielle.

01:11:41.125 --> 01:11:43.083
- Married to no one.
- You are.

01:11:43.625 --> 01:11:46.208
Marriage is a sacrament. Before God.

01:11:48.416 --> 01:11:50.375
What do you know about God?

01:11:51.458 --> 01:11:54.250
How do you know what He allows

01:11:54.416 --> 01:11:55.916
or what He forbids?

01:11:59.541 --> 01:12:01.083
You came back.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:02.208
Back to me.

01:12:05.333 --> 01:12:06.166
I'm not sure.

01:12:10.375 --> 01:12:11.791
You're mad.

01:12:14.208 --> 01:12:15.458
He's mad.

01:16:22.625 --> 01:16:23.916
Where have you been?

01:16:24.083 --> 01:16:25.208
Right here.

01:16:26.041 --> 01:16:27.875
You're seeing the doctor at 5.

01:16:29.791 --> 01:16:31.375
I'll help you clear up.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.916
We're accused of being charlatans,

01:16:42.083 --> 01:16:45.333
but with certain qualities,
judging by your results.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.541
Besides your dizzy spell,
you're fine now, ma'am.

01:16:49.458 --> 01:16:52.291
The cure is over.
You can leave us now.

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:53.833
When?

01:16:54.458 --> 01:16:57.250
- Your husband called...
- I don't want to go home.

01:17:00.041 --> 01:17:02.125
Your private life is not my concern.

01:17:02.291 --> 01:17:03.791
He telephoned.

01:17:03.958 --> 01:17:05.958
He's picking you up tomorrow.

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:10.208
We have to leave.

01:17:10.458 --> 01:17:11.875
We have to go right...

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.000
What are you doing?

01:17:17.791 --> 01:17:19.333
What's all this luggage?

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.000
I was waiting for you.

01:17:30.916 --> 01:17:32.708
My husband's coming tomorrow.

01:17:38.333 --> 01:17:40.791
It's the end of the cure. We knew.

01:17:44.125 --> 01:17:45.416
I'll leave with you.

01:17:46.708 --> 01:17:48.291
Not now. It’s impossible.

01:17:49.041 --> 01:17:50.750
I have matters to attend to.

01:17:52.166 --> 01:17:53.625
I'm leaving the army.

01:17:53.791 --> 01:17:54.916
It's over.

01:17:56.125 --> 01:17:57.541
There's no point now.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.583
What will I do?

01:18:02.791 --> 01:18:04.250
What can I do?

01:18:04.958 --> 01:18:07.416
You can't just walk out either.

01:18:09.666 --> 01:18:11.208
I won't leave you.

01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:14.208
- I don't want to.
- Me neither.

01:18:14.416 --> 01:18:16.208
We'll write, okay?

01:18:16.791 --> 01:18:18.625
I'll tell you where we'll meet.

01:18:18.791 --> 01:18:21.375
I don't know yet, but I'll tell you.

01:18:26.333 --> 01:18:28.125
Right now, it's impossible.

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:37.708
If you love me, believe me.

01:18:37.875 --> 01:18:39.041
Promise me.

01:18:39.916 --> 01:18:41.250
I promise you.

01:19:30.458 --> 01:19:32.041
The same amount?

01:19:32.208 --> 01:19:33.166
450 francs?

01:19:35.458 --> 01:19:37.208
The bill's itemized.

01:19:37.416 --> 01:19:39.125
Treatment and accommodation.

01:19:39.291 --> 01:19:40.791
That's the treatment?

01:19:50.125 --> 01:19:51.625
Time to say goodbye?

01:19:54.125 --> 01:19:55.375
We'll meet again.

01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:56.708
You think?

01:19:58.791 --> 01:20:00.416
I've been happy here.

01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:41.083
I put furniture in.
Feel free to change anything.

01:20:55.291 --> 01:20:56.875
You bought a piano?

01:21:00.083 --> 01:21:01.208
For you.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.500
So, you're happy?

01:21:13.708 --> 01:21:15.291
You've thought of a name?

01:21:16.583 --> 01:21:18.791
You've absolutely floored mommy.

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:21.083
She can't stop talking about it.

01:21:22.416 --> 01:21:24.125
She must be missing me.

01:21:28.791 --> 01:21:30.750
What do you think of René?

01:21:32.958 --> 01:21:34.125
He seems fine.

01:21:35.666 --> 01:21:36.666
He's tall.

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:38.416
Don't be mean!

01:21:39.916 --> 01:21:41.666
We're moving to Gap.

01:21:42.875 --> 01:21:44.166
A dentist's selling up.

01:21:47.791 --> 01:21:48.750
Gap.

01:21:51.208 --> 01:21:52.666
What's the suitcase?

01:21:52.833 --> 01:21:53.875
Leave it!

01:21:54.625 --> 01:21:56.083
It's clothes and stuff.

01:22:03.166 --> 01:22:05.250
Fine house José built you.

01:22:18.041 --> 01:22:20.083
Don't go in
with your shoes on.

01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:22.000
Can we have some help here?

01:22:22.208 --> 01:22:23.375
It's heavy.

01:22:28.875 --> 01:22:30.041
Jeannine!

01:22:30.250 --> 01:22:31.625
Go for a swim.

01:22:31.791 --> 01:22:33.125
I forgot my costume.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
To offspring!

01:22:48.125 --> 01:22:49.875
Good health, Gabrielle!

01:23:10.833 --> 01:23:12.750
I'm going to hurt you, José.

01:23:15.666 --> 01:23:16.708
What?

01:23:17.791 --> 01:23:20.041
You want this child too, don’t you?

01:23:20.458 --> 01:23:21.500
Yes.

01:23:24.958 --> 01:23:26.875
I met a man at the spa.

01:23:29.541 --> 01:23:30.708
I love him.

01:23:32.416 --> 01:23:34.500
When he asks, I'll go to him.

01:23:42.916 --> 01:23:43.958
Where?

01:23:45.291 --> 01:23:46.333
Where will you go?

01:23:46.708 --> 01:23:47.916
I don't know.

01:23:49.291 --> 01:23:50.750
I'll be with him.

01:23:52.583 --> 01:23:53.791
What the hell!

01:24:19.125 --> 01:24:20.333
<i>My love,</i>

01:24:21.958 --> 01:24:23.958
<i>Perhaps you left Lyon.</i>

01:24:25.208 --> 01:24:27.625
<i>I suppose
the Defense Ministry is in Paris.</i>

01:24:28.666 --> 01:24:30.958
<i>You haven't yet replied to my letters.</i>

01:24:31.625 --> 01:24:33.000
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:24:33.166 --> 01:24:34.208
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:24:34.916 --> 01:24:36.458
<i>I'm afraid for you.</i>

01:24:37.125 --> 01:24:38.958
<i>I haven't unpacked my suitcase.</i>

01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:40.500
<i>All I do is wait.</i>

01:24:41.416 --> 01:24:42.875
<i>That's all I am.</i>

01:24:43.916 --> 01:24:45.625
<i>Your body invaded mine.</i>

01:24:45.791 --> 01:24:47.666
<i>I am planted within you.</i>

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.666
<i>I am alone with you.</i>

01:24:50.708 --> 01:24:52.291
<i>I made myself a dress.</i>

01:24:52.458 --> 01:24:53.625
<i>It's blue.</i>

01:24:54.458 --> 01:24:56.375
<i>I have to wear a slip with it.</i>

01:24:56.541 --> 01:24:58.375
<i>Otherwise it's see-through.</i>

01:25:02.333 --> 01:25:04.166
I'd forgotten where I put this.

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:21.916
<i>André,
I belong to you...</i>

01:25:33.250 --> 01:25:34.333
Morning.

01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:42.958
Nothing else?

01:25:44.833 --> 01:25:46.708
Check.
Check in your bag.

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:48.375
That's all there is.

01:25:49.541 --> 01:25:51.291
Nothing at the post office?

01:25:51.875 --> 01:25:52.916
Goodbye.

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:03.791
Just a catalogue.

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:07.958
<i>My love,
You say nothing.</i>

01:26:08.291 --> 01:26:10.000
<i>You leave me in silence.</i>

01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:12.375
<i>What displeased you in my letters?</i>

01:26:13.083 --> 01:26:14.125
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:26:15.041 --> 01:26:17.291
<i>I hope the Army didn't take you back.</i>

01:26:17.666 --> 01:26:19.625
<i>And send you back to the war.</i>

01:26:20.125 --> 01:26:22.958
<i>I picture you there, wounded perhaps.</i>

01:26:23.125 --> 01:26:25.500
<i>There were awful photos in Match.</i>

01:26:26.416 --> 01:26:27.500
<i>Talk to me.</i>

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.750
<i>I need you to talk to me.</i>

01:26:32.250 --> 01:26:34.583
<i>There are cold currents in the sea.</i>

01:26:35.208 --> 01:26:37.208
<i>On Tuesday, a young boy drowned.</i>

01:26:48.166 --> 01:26:49.458
No, ma'am, nothing.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.375
What are you doing?

01:27:10.458 --> 01:27:11.583
You see.

01:27:13.916 --> 01:27:15.583
But you've had no reply.

01:27:22.333 --> 01:27:23.750
True, you're right.

01:27:27.416 --> 01:27:28.875
Send the taxi away.

01:27:32.708 --> 01:27:33.916
<i>My love,</i>

01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:37.250
<i>I'll do my best to finish this letter.</i>

01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:41.625
<i>What do you want to hear
that I haven't said?</i>

01:27:43.375 --> 01:27:44.541
<i>I have no more words.</i>

01:27:46.583 --> 01:27:47.625
<i>Why?</i>

01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:50.750
<i>Why are you angry with me?</i>

01:27:52.125 --> 01:27:53.791
<i>What did I do wrong?</i>

01:27:55.375 --> 01:27:56.583
<i>I think back.</i>

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.000
<i>I have no more words.</i>

01:28:04.166 --> 01:28:05.833
<i>I have no more words.</i>

01:28:12.083 --> 01:28:13.708
<i>My body's on fire</i>

01:28:13.875 --> 01:28:15.583
<i>I want to feel...</i>

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:18.416
<i>I picture you there, wounded perhaps.</i>

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.250
My letters.

01:29:08.666 --> 01:29:09.625
Go away!

01:29:29.583 --> 01:29:30.916
Let me go!

01:30:44.333 --> 01:30:46.333
This is the last time I'll write.

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:50.125
I'm expecting your child.

01:30:53.125 --> 01:30:54.916
I didn't want to tell you.

01:30:55.875 --> 01:31:00.000
So you wouldn't think I was trying
to influence your attitude toward me.

01:31:02.458 --> 01:31:05.625
I don't want to know
why you didn't read my letters.

01:31:06.333 --> 01:31:08.458
My head couldn't stand it.

01:31:11.125 --> 01:31:13.250
If you don't reply to this one,

01:31:14.708 --> 01:31:16.250
it will all be over.

01:31:18.333 --> 01:31:19.708
Gabrielle.

01:31:23.791 --> 01:31:25.708
Where's that beautiful baby?

01:31:31.375 --> 01:31:33.125
Kiss your son, Gabrielle.

01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:05.375
<i>The Association of Veterans
of French Indochina</i>

01:32:05.541 --> 01:32:08.500
<i>was founded to defend
fighting men's interests</i>

01:32:08.666 --> 01:32:10.666
<i>and honor the memory of our dead.</i>

01:32:10.833 --> 01:32:13.708
<i>At times like this,
remembrance is crucial.</i>

01:32:13.875 --> 01:32:18.458
<i>Spare a thought for men
in Viet-Minh camps awaiting liberation.</i>

01:32:19.166 --> 01:32:20.083
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:24.083
<i>We can now go aboard
to interview the wounded.</i>

01:32:25.833 --> 01:32:27.375
<i>Where were you wounded?</i>

01:32:27.541 --> 01:32:28.916
<i>In Cochinchina.</i>

01:32:29.083 --> 01:32:30.500
<i>A long time ago?</i>

01:32:31.041 --> 01:32:32.791
Lunch outside, José?

01:32:42.375 --> 01:32:43.500
Daddy!

01:32:48.083 --> 01:32:49.583
I'm filing for divorce.

01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:51.416
What are you talking about?

01:32:51.583 --> 01:32:53.625
We don't divorce in our family.

01:32:53.791 --> 01:32:55.208
I never see him.

01:32:55.833 --> 01:32:57.250
He works all week.

01:32:57.416 --> 01:32:59.875
Sundays, he's out with his friends.

01:33:01.416 --> 01:33:02.833
I'm always alone.

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:10.458
You've not been unhappy
with José.

01:33:12.875 --> 01:33:14.666
José's the private type.

01:33:15.541 --> 01:33:16.875
He never talks.

01:33:18.291 --> 01:33:21.250
Even about events in Spain
when he was young.

01:33:21.416 --> 01:33:23.000
Or what happened with me.

01:33:23.333 --> 01:33:25.041
He keeps it to himself.

01:33:27.083 --> 01:33:28.791
No, I've not been unhappy.

01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:32.625
We had a great adventure.

01:33:32.791 --> 01:33:34.208
Go on, show them.

01:33:35.166 --> 01:33:37.500
Maybe it'll spill out in the car.

01:33:39.583 --> 01:33:40.500
Show them.

01:33:40.666 --> 01:33:41.625
Look.

01:33:41.791 --> 01:33:43.500
Not enough sweet pepper.

01:33:43.833 --> 01:33:45.416
Look, there's two of them.

01:33:45.583 --> 01:33:47.375
That's a huge fish.

01:33:49.166 --> 01:33:49.958
Come on.

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:52.000
You see its little scales?

01:34:10.666 --> 01:34:13.000
<i>June Barcarolle by Tchaikovsky,</i>

<i>performed by Emil Gilels.</i>

01:35:17.333 --> 01:35:18.375
Try again.

01:35:33.666 --> 01:35:34.666
Good.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000
I'm very pleased.
He's hardworking and gifted.

01:35:44.166 --> 01:35:45.375
Of course, he's gifted.

01:35:45.541 --> 01:35:47.083
Can you work on that?

01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:48.541
<i>The Barcarolle.</i>

01:35:50.791 --> 01:35:51.916
Later, perhaps.

01:35:52.458 --> 01:35:53.500
We'll see.

01:35:54.125 --> 01:35:55.166
Goodbye.

01:35:56.708 --> 01:35:58.125
Marc, see you Friday.

01:35:58.291 --> 01:35:59.833
- Hello.
- Hello, there.

01:36:00.625 --> 01:36:02.958
Twice a week's a lot, isn't it?

01:36:03.125 --> 01:36:04.541
You're no musician.

01:36:18.625 --> 01:36:20.083
I'm going out to play.

01:37:28.583 --> 01:37:29.750
Bravo, honey.

01:37:30.208 --> 01:37:31.583
It was marvelous.

01:37:39.666 --> 01:37:41.750
All on your own here, mama?

01:37:46.583 --> 01:37:50.208
I don't find Gabrielle
very affectionate with the boy.

01:37:59.041 --> 01:38:00.291
Perhaps

01:38:01.166 --> 01:38:03.416
she was never taught any different.

01:38:09.708 --> 01:38:11.708
You'll stay over with us tonight.

01:38:11.875 --> 01:38:13.083
No, I'll go home.

01:38:18.541 --> 01:38:19.708
Good, wasn't it?

01:38:19.875 --> 01:38:20.875
Yes, it was.

01:38:22.833 --> 01:38:26.125
His teacher wants to enter him
for a national competition.

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:27.375
In Lyon.

01:38:27.541 --> 01:38:28.583
We could go.

01:38:29.125 --> 01:38:30.250
I don't know.

01:38:32.625 --> 01:38:33.958
It'd get us out.

01:38:39.666 --> 01:38:41.000
Has my mother gone?

01:38:41.625 --> 01:38:42.458
Yes.

01:39:01.708 --> 01:39:02.875
Evening.

01:39:03.041 --> 01:39:04.208
It's late.

01:39:05.333 --> 01:39:06.791
Mr. Rabascall.

01:39:09.041 --> 01:39:10.541
Ma'am, please.

01:39:14.958 --> 01:39:16.583
The taxi's waiting outside.

01:39:22.125 --> 01:39:23.416
What's he doing?

01:39:34.458 --> 01:39:35.416
You take him.

01:39:35.583 --> 01:39:36.625
I'll see you there.

01:39:37.041 --> 01:39:38.125
Go!

01:39:39.083 --> 01:39:40.208
Drive.

01:40:41.291 --> 01:40:42.375
Hello.

01:40:43.833 --> 01:40:45.250
Do you remember me?

01:40:45.875 --> 01:40:47.875
A long time ago, at the spa.

01:40:48.041 --> 01:40:49.083
Yes.

01:40:50.375 --> 01:40:51.791
Can I come in?

01:40:56.291 --> 01:40:58.958
I'm afraid I have to lock up.
It's for sale.

01:41:00.166 --> 01:41:02.541
The General passed away 3 months ago.

01:41:10.625 --> 01:41:11.625
But André...

01:41:12.291 --> 01:41:13.500
André Sauvage?

01:41:15.250 --> 01:41:17.125
He never replied to my letters.

01:41:19.041 --> 01:41:20.041
Ma'am...

01:41:22.916 --> 01:41:24.041
The Lieutenant died.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.041
When?

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.750
The day he left the spa.

01:41:33.458 --> 01:41:34.708
You were there.

01:41:35.875 --> 01:41:37.625
The ambulance took him away.

01:41:39.458 --> 01:41:42.041
He died in Lyon. At the hospital.

01:41:45.208 --> 01:41:46.291
No.

01:41:48.416 --> 01:41:49.583
He came back.

01:41:50.208 --> 01:41:51.875
Afterwards, he came back.

01:41:52.583 --> 01:41:53.666
No, ma'am.

01:41:54.291 --> 01:41:55.791
He didn't come back.

01:41:58.291 --> 01:41:59.333
He did.

01:42:02.208 --> 01:42:03.125
No.

01:44:26.083 --> 01:44:27.458
How did it go?

01:44:28.458 --> 01:44:30.416
Well. He won second prize.

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:42.958
Did you find anything?

01:44:49.875 --> 01:44:52.250
Wash your face. We're going.

01:45:13.708 --> 01:45:15.916
You came to see me at the spa.

01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:19.458
Yes.

01:45:23.875 --> 01:45:25.333
It was a foggy day.

01:45:28.375 --> 01:45:31.041
You said I always brought rain.

01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:36.000
I'm going for a smoke.

01:45:55.041 --> 01:45:56.166
Here.

01:46:08.125 --> 01:46:10.083
Sir, can you sign this?

01:46:25.875 --> 01:46:27.458
You're taking a cure?

01:46:28.958 --> 01:46:29.833
No.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.041
You?

01:46:31.791 --> 01:46:34.333
This is my last night.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

01:46:35.416 --> 01:46:38.208
Transferring
to Desgenettes Hospital in Lyon.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.375
All bets are off.

01:46:52.583 --> 01:46:53.916
Black tobacco.

01:47:06.833 --> 01:47:08.916
I'm not bothered about dying.

01:47:09.833 --> 01:47:11.916
As a man and soldier.

01:47:12.625 --> 01:47:15.166
It's the only thing
the army teaches you.

01:47:16.833 --> 01:47:18.208
Have you been to war?

01:47:19.666 --> 01:47:20.708
I've seen it.

01:47:30.625 --> 01:47:32.083
See that woman?

01:47:39.125 --> 01:47:40.333
Beautiful, isn't she?

01:47:43.916 --> 01:47:45.333
We met here.

01:47:49.541 --> 01:47:52.333
I could have loved her. In another life.

01:47:56.791 --> 01:47:58.000
Nothing now.

01:47:58.416 --> 01:48:00.583
No hard-on. I feel nothing.

01:48:04.375 --> 01:48:05.416
I'm sorry.

01:48:07.708 --> 01:48:09.291
You came to see someone?

01:48:12.458 --> 01:48:13.666
My wife.

01:48:27.666 --> 01:48:29.666
At the guesthouse, I couldn't sleep.

01:48:32.541 --> 01:48:34.333
I went back that night.

01:53:22.458 --> 01:53:24.416
If you want, I'll leave.

01:53:44.333 --> 01:53:45.958
It's an Italian boat.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.041
A container ship.

01:53:50.791 --> 01:53:52.875
That one's going to Sardinia.

01:54:06.083 --> 01:54:08.208
Why didn't you ever tell me?

01:54:12.833 --> 01:54:14.416
I wanted you to live.

01:55:23.083 --> 01:55:24.125
That's it?

01:55:25.291 --> 01:55:26.000
Yes.

01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:29.125
Which house is yours?

01:55:43.166 --> 01:55:48.125
FROM THE LAND OF THE MOON

01:56:23.458 --> 01:56:25.833
