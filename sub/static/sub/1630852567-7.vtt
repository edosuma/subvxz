Yeah, no, okay,
we can move on

21:22.115 --> 21:24.581
From getting drugged at the bar
to the bridge.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.583
- Please don't.
- You once told me

21:26.653 --> 21:29.252
That you would often think
about that moment.

21:29.289 --> 21:32.589
You waking up, his smiling
face towering over you.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.328
Hey, uh,
I know this is hard but...

21:37.463 --> 21:40.064
It helps to talk about this.
- Does it, ro?

21:41.267 --> 21:43.600
Or does that make you just like
everyone else?

21:43.602 --> 21:46.937
- No, hey, that is not fair.
I was there, too.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.106
- I thought you loved me.
- I did! I...

21:49.241 --> 21:51.908
I do.
That is why I am doing this.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.145
- You're just another person
exploiting my story for profit.

21:55.281 --> 21:57.415
- No, no, you knew that
we were gonna talk about

21:57.417 --> 21:59.149
Some uncomfortable things.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.951
- It's always the same,
isn't it?

22:01.020 --> 22:02.786
Make a buck off of trauma

22:02.822 --> 22:05.222

someone evolve.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.124

22:07.259 --> 22:09.026

harness my power,

22:09.095 --> 22:11.962

22:13.700 --> 22:15.665

22:15.702 --> 22:17.568
When I asked you when's
the last time you saw blake.

22:17.703 --> 22:19.837
This footage puts you with him
hours before he died.

22:19.839 --> 22:23.240
- Look, I-I was... Really upset
after blake left the interview,

22:23.242 --> 22:25.041
So-so I went to my
partner's house.

22:25.178 --> 22:26.777
You can call him,
or I don't know,

22:26.779 --> 22:28.512
Check the-the security camera
footage at his condo.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.448
- Okay, why not tell me
the truth when I asked

22:30.450 --> 22:32.315
When's the last time
you saw him?

22:32.352 --> 22:34.251
- I panicked, okay?
I-I know how this looks!

22:34.387 --> 22:35.652
- How does it look?

22:37.390 --> 22:39.189
- I knew that blake
was having a hard time.

22:39.258 --> 22:40.657
That he was funnelling
his money

22:40.693 --> 22:42.659
Into some sort of online thing.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.795
I thought I could have him
on the show,

22:44.797 --> 22:46.730
And get him a bit of cash.

22:46.799 --> 22:49.666
You know, and maybe push him
to talk about what happened.

22:49.668 --> 22:51.469
Heal him a little.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.371
- Yeah, and get monster
views online.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.373
- Yeah, a reunion special
would uh...

22:55.508 --> 22:57.441
Bring out all the true crime
junkies.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.410
- No, this is my story, too!

23:03.015 --> 23:05.149
(shaky) after the gaswick
incident,

23:05.218 --> 23:08.685
We were inundated with requests
for podcasts,

23:08.755 --> 23:11.288
Documentaries, news stories.

23:11.357 --> 23:14.291
Do you guys know what it feels
like to be violated?

23:14.293 --> 23:16.126
Your body broken,

23:16.162 --> 23:18.529
And then, there's this pressure
to perform.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.634
People would gawk at us
on the street.

23:23.769 --> 23:25.602
They would ask for our
autographs.

23:26.672 --> 23:29.306
They'd ask for us
to describe what happened.

23:30.609 --> 23:32.576
We were continually
being re-traumatized.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.247
At a certain point,
I just gave up.

23:37.283 --> 23:39.049
- So, you created the show.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.719
- Yeah, I figured if-if,
if I can't escape my past,

23:41.721 --> 23:44.120
Then I might as well
monetize it.

23:44.157 --> 23:46.857
Make money and give agency
to the survivors.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.028
But I knew that blake
wasn't well

23:51.163 --> 23:53.197
When he came in
for the interview.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.332
I shoulda stopped him.

23:55.334 --> 23:56.967
- What do you mean by that?

23:58.004 --> 24:00.170
- Well, he-he was agitated.

24:00.173 --> 24:02.873
I don't know, he was spitting
some paranoid stuff

24:02.875 --> 24:04.942
About the end of the world,

24:04.944 --> 24:07.177
Uh, glaciers melting,
food shortages.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.146
- I mean, does that really...

24:09.148 --> 24:10.681
Classify as crazy talk
these days?

24:10.750 --> 24:12.549
Everybody's stressing out
about these things.

24:12.618 --> 24:15.152
- No, this was next level.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.354
It was truly delusional.

24:17.423 --> 24:20.891
He... Went back on it when it
was the on-camera stuff

24:20.893 --> 24:23.761

towards the end.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.563
Up until that woman
interrupted him.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.331
- What woman?

24:27.466 --> 24:28.765
- She came to the studio
with him.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.534
He said that they were friends,

24:30.570 --> 24:32.703
But she acted more like
his handler.

24:32.838 --> 24:34.838
Cut things off when it got
too intense.

24:34.907 --> 24:37.474
They left together.

the last person

- Or the one who murdered him.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.047
- Murder? What?

24:43.182 --> 24:45.049
What are you talking about?

24:45.051 --> 24:46.784

that blake was killed.

<i> Jenny: Malik, it's donovan.</i>

41:39.931 --> 41:42.165
He's part of the same
wellness group as the victims.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.066
- Yeah, uh, we need
to find him, now.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.203
(engine cuts out,
door opens)

41:48.874 --> 41:50.639
(donovan's phone chimes)

41:53.445 --> 41:55.478
(reads) "don't be mad,
can't pass up on an opportunity

41:55.480 --> 41:56.979
To get to the next level."

41:58.016 --> 42:00.016
Damn it, cassidy!

42:03.255 --> 42:05.087

42:08.026 --> 42:10.426
(sighs)

42:10.462 --> 42:12.295
Resolve to evolve.
