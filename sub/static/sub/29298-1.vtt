16:09.736 --> 16:11.502
We can take that and,
even if it gets rough,

16:11.504 --> 16:13.838
we'll make it with the truck.
- Then what are you gonna do?

16:13.840 --> 16:15.606
- We'll meet you
at the air force base,

16:15.608 --> 16:17.709
but we have to get them.

16:17.711 --> 16:20.578
- All right.
You guys give 'em hell, okay?

16:21.982 --> 16:23.881
- We'll see you soon... somehow.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.517
- Yeah. You save those kids.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.854
Hey, by the way, you know what?

16:29.856 --> 16:31.889
You should take whatever
you want from the lab,

16:31.891 --> 16:34.192
anything that you think
is gonna help you.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.694
- Okay, Larry. Thanks.
See you later.

16:37.931 --> 16:39.864
All right.
See what you can find in here.

16:39.866 --> 16:42.533
And I'm gonna take a look around
and see what else we can get.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.168
- You mean steal?

16:44.170 --> 16:47.238
- It's not stealing.
I'm the boss.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.840
- Okay, boss.

17:05.759 --> 17:08.226
Okay, this'll help.

- All right, men, let's go.</i>

18:49.262 --> 18:51.262
- Excuse me, sir?

18:51.264 --> 18:52.296

20:22.722 --> 20:24.155
- Yuck.

20:24.157 --> 20:26.090
Would you like some wine
with some of that cheese?

20:27.827 --> 20:29.961
- How's it looking out there?

20:29.963 --> 20:32.797
- Well, the teacher left.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.966
- Left?
What do you mean, left?

20:34.968 --> 20:37.835
- Tyler, he just walked out.

20:39.939 --> 20:43.040
- Uh, yeah.
Things aren't great.

20:43.042 --> 20:46.711
We're almost out of supplies.

20:46.713 --> 20:50.114
It's just about all gone.

20:50.116 --> 20:52.717
There's only enough food
to last us a few more days.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.986
- The others need to know.

20:54.988 --> 20:58.189
- Brie, these kids
got left here, trapped.

20:58.191 --> 21:00.725
We have no idea what to do.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.093
- Kids?

21:02.095 --> 21:03.794
They're like two years
younger than us.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.263
- And if we hadn't shown up,

21:05.265 --> 21:06.931
who knows what kind
of shape they'd be in?

21:09.836 --> 21:11.636
Did you get hold
of your parents?

21:11.638 --> 21:14.505
- Yeah, but I could barely hear
them over the cloud cover.

21:14.507 --> 21:18.042
They said that they were
on their way to help us.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.610
- Your dad won't
let anything get in the way

21:19.612 --> 21:21.212
of saving his daughter.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.184
I'm sorry our trip
got cut short.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.220
I was having a great time.

21:29.222 --> 21:31.355
- Me too.

21:31.357 --> 21:35.126
But, Tyler, we need
to help these kids.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.995
- Oh, kids?
They're kids now?

21:37.997 --> 21:41.032
- Tyler... we need
to help them.

21:41.034 --> 21:43.768
- Brie, everyone out there
is on the edge right now.

21:43.770 --> 21:47.038
If we tell them that
we're about out of supplies...

21:47.040 --> 21:49.273
Some of them are liable
to go off the deep end.

21:49.275 --> 21:52.143
- Then we'll tell them
help is on the way.

22:08.394 --> 22:10.061
My parents
should be here soon.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.862
Hopefully, they can get
the van running

22:11.864 --> 22:13.531
and we'll be out of here soon.

22:13.533 --> 22:18.102
Look, I know it sucks and
I know you're all scared.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.603
So am I.

22:19.605 --> 22:21.439
But what we have to do now is...

22:21.441 --> 22:23.140
- Uh, excuse me?

22:23.142 --> 22:25.376
I don't remember anyone
electing you as spokesman

22:25.378 --> 22:28.479
or leader or whatever the hell
it is you think you are now!

22:28.481 --> 22:29.714
- Roger, don't.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.148
- Besides...

22:33.319 --> 22:35.086
You don't
even go to school here.

22:35.088 --> 22:37.288
- No one elected anyone
to do anything.

22:37.290 --> 22:38.856
Tyler and I are
just trying to...

22:38.858 --> 22:40.858
- We have a van out there.
we just need to get it running.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.626
- That's enough.

22:42.628 --> 22:45.796
- Tyler... I got this.

22:45.798 --> 22:47.365
So, Roger, right?

22:47.367 --> 22:49.500
Am I pronouncing
that right, Roger?

22:49.502 --> 22:51.302
So what's your plan?

22:51.304 --> 22:53.637
- Hey, you're the one
who appointed yourself.

22:53.639 --> 22:54.905
You tell me...
- No, go on.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.540
You're in charge now.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.542
So do you have the mechanical
ability to get the van running?

22:58.544 --> 23:00.111
- That's not what
I'm talking about. What...

23:00.113 --> 23:02.046
- And once you get it running,
do you know how

23:02.048 --> 23:03.814
to clear the roads
and figure out what to do next

23:03.816 --> 23:04.949
and where to go?

it's gonna be anything good.

of hours before it hits us.

- Well, I was raised by
a couple of scientists.

30:01.433 --> 30:03.700
I was raised
to think analytically

before panicking.

30:05.504 --> 30:08.105
But, yeah, we do need to hurry.

me how to change my oil.

other exits and windows

30:20.452 --> 30:22.853

- No. We gotta find our
daughter.

31:41.967 --> 31:44.468
She's at
Redwoods Community College.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.837
- Oh.

31:46.839 --> 31:49.539
That's only a few miles
down the mountain,

31:49.541 --> 31:52.776

at the entrance.

31:52.778 --> 31:54.411
- Well, we both better
get a move on

31:54.413 --> 31:55.412

reach our destinations

31:55.414 --> 31:57.014
before the storm hits.

31:57.016 --> 32:00.250
- Okay. Are you sure you don't
wanna go to the bunkers?

32:00.252 --> 32:01.818
You guys gotta get to safety

32:01.820 --> 32:03.520

too crazy to be out here.

32:03.522 --> 32:06.390
- Yeah, we're sure.
We gotta get going.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.392
I mean, get your son to safety.

32:08.394 --> 32:09.826
- Watch those icy patches, okay?

32:09.828 --> 32:11.628
There's still time
to drive safely,

32:11.630 --> 32:13.230
but you need
to leave right now.

32:13.232 --> 32:16.133
- We will.
Thank you so much.

32:19.505 --> 32:20.971
- Thank you.

32:20.973 --> 32:24.374
- You're welcome, buddy.
Take care of your mom.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.543

I go to school here?

34:46.150 --> 34:48.351

the teacher's lounge or...

34:49.888 --> 34:51.955

36:41.433 --> 36:43.433
This ice has got to be
at least six feet thick.

36:43.435 --> 36:46.136
- Maybe we can build a fire
and burn our way through.

36:46.138 --> 36:47.971
We have scraps.
We can use those as kindling?

36:47.973 --> 36:49.472

thick enough

36:49.474 --> 36:50.907
to break through this ice.

36:50.909 --> 36:53.043
Then it will take,
what, 12 hours?

36:53.045 --> 36:55.178
- And we don't have anywhere
near that kind of time.

36:55.180 --> 36:57.547

something in here we can use

36:57.549 --> 36:59.115

- Dude, what is your deal?
- Calm down!

37:08.527 --> 37:10.126
- We don't have any time at all.

37:10.128 --> 37:12.429
Who knows when another avalanche
may come right on top of us,

37:12.431 --> 37:13.563
maybe even a bigger one!

37:13.565 --> 37:14.965
- That's enough.

37:14.967 --> 37:17.467
- We need to do something now!
- What is that?

37:17.469 --> 37:18.835
- Where'd you get that from?

37:18.837 --> 37:20.003
- I found this in
the janitor's closet

37:20.005 --> 37:21.638
along with some
tanks of propane.

37:21.640 --> 37:25.141
Stack them up against the doors
and use this to set them off!

37:25.143 --> 37:29.112
- You have been watching way
too many shark movies.

37:29.114 --> 37:31.848
- We blow it up so you
can get the van running.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.116
If not, we start walking
to find help.

37:33.118 --> 37:34.951
- I know it looks pretty bad.

37:34.953 --> 37:36.286
But I don't think
it's a good idea

37:36.288 --> 37:38.822
to blow up our only
shelter from the inside!

37:38.824 --> 37:41.258
- Look, I just can't be
in here anymore.

37:41.260 --> 37:43.793
- Look, the avalanche
hasn't buried the roof yet.

37:43.795 --> 37:44.828
We still have that
beacon up there.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.296
- Stupid beacon!

37:46.298 --> 37:47.964
- Yeah, stupid beacon,
but it's big enough

37:47.966 --> 37:49.366
to be seen from miles off.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.601
And we were saving it
for last resort.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.403
- So how long are we gonna wait?

37:54.973 --> 37:57.140
- Look, all I'm asking
for is two hours.

37:57.142 --> 37:58.842
I'll go up to the roof,
light the beacon and,

37:58.844 --> 38:00.543
if no one comes
within two hours, then fine.

38:06.051 --> 38:09.019
but I think we're running
out of options.

38:09.021 --> 38:10.520
Do you have any ideas?

38:14.526 --> 38:18.695
Two hours?
- Two hours.

38:18.697 --> 38:20.864
- Tyler, help me
with the beacon.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.400
- You got it.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.409

39:06.411 --> 39:08.011
We still doing good?

39:08.013 --> 39:11.047
- I'd say we got about
an 80-minute buffer.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.450
But, Mark, the anomaly
isn't going away.

39:13.452 --> 39:16.486
I don't think it's a glitch.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.388
I think it might be real.

39:18.390 --> 39:19.489
- Where is it?

39:19.491 --> 39:21.558

we got to the cabin,

42:12.097 --> 42:14.697
I don't get it.

42:14.699 --> 42:17.267
Why would a plateau not
be affected by the storm?

42:17.269 --> 42:19.302
- It must interrupt
the flow of the weather.

42:19.304 --> 42:21.704
The shape and the altitude
create a pocket

42:21.706 --> 42:24.674
where the storms
just go around and over it,

42:24.676 --> 42:27.677
thus leaving the area
protected from the elements.

42:27.679 --> 42:29.012
It's like, um...

42:29.014 --> 42:31.214
It's like a concrete
post in a river.

42:31.216 --> 42:33.483
It just diverts
the current around it.

42:33.485 --> 42:34.717
- And over it?

42:34.719 --> 42:37.153

with what we're seeing?

Oh, I wasn't ready
for that one.

we're losing ground.

42:58.610 --> 43:02.545
I think the storm
is picking up speed.

43:02.547 --> 43:06.349
- I think if we can just get
Brie's device to that plateau,

43:06.351 --> 43:08.585
we can get the data that
we need to send back to Larry

43:08.587 --> 43:12.789
and the military to learn how
to deal with these storms!

43:14.159 --> 43:16.392

gonna be the same.

43:16.394 --> 43:18.962
We can't stop this.

43:18.964 --> 43:23.800
- No, but with that data, we
can learn to adapt as a species.

Just wish we had any idea
where we are right now,

43:30.175 --> 43:32.342
