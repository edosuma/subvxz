successfully concluded

01:02.070 --> 01:05.507
an investigation to end
a very serious breach

The arrest of Robert Hanssen

01:12.915 --> 01:14.074
for espionage

01:14.783 --> 01:19.050
should remind us all,
every American should know

01:19.388 --> 01:22.323
that our nation,
our free society

They were screaming
at each other.

03:47.142 --> 03:48.836
We've got to tell
the CT guys.

03:48.910 --> 03:50.469
Did you catch any of
what they were saying?

03:50.545 --> 03:53.480
Some of it. Just gonna
need a translator.
Okay.

03:54.082 --> 03:56.813

to us is what it was
doing on Gene's desk.

It's against Bureau policy

Yes, I did.

is never off-duty.

19:54.349 --> 19:57.442
Last I looked, she hadn't
been read into the case.
Can she hear this?

19:57.518 --> 19:58.507
No.

19:58.786 --> 20:00.617

20:00.856 --> 20:03.347
I just started them.
He kept me there till 10:00.

20:03.458 --> 20:04.618
Uh-huh.

20:04.693 --> 20:07.628
Agent Burroughs, I don't know
what I'm supposed to be
looking for with this guy.

20:07.696 --> 20:09.994
It's not like he's gonna
bring a train of hookers
through the office.

20:10.365 --> 20:12.128
Just get me my pages.

20:12.300 --> 20:13.995

20:14.069 --> 20:16.470

20:34.190 --> 20:36.181
Bobby Hanssen.

21:01.518 --> 21:03.850
ERIC: He doesn't think
too much of me.

21:04.688 --> 21:05.677
No?

21:06.389 --> 21:07.722
No.

21:14.666 --> 21:17.999
There are a couple of people
like that at work.

21:19.537 --> 21:21.128
They think I'm a

21:22.041 --> 21:23.598
lightweight,
I guess.

21:25.810 --> 21:27.539
They don't know you.

21:30.549 --> 21:32.107
Maybe they do.

21:55.642 --> 21:56.835

21:57.209 --> 21:58.609
Great.

22:04.316 --> 22:05.614
Good morning.

22:07.387 --> 22:08.877
Good morning.

22:22.403 --> 22:24.199
This is very good work.

22:26.574 --> 22:30.374
Sir, how did you
get a copy of...
It was ignored, I'm sure.

22:31.277 --> 22:32.370
Yes, it was.

22:36.118 --> 22:38.779
That's because
you don't shoot.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.452
The FBI is a gun culture.

22:41.522 --> 22:44.047
You can't advance here
unless you're part of it.

22:44.126 --> 22:48.118
Every director in the history
of the Bureau has come from
the law enforcement side.

22:48.195 --> 22:50.790
The guys who shoot,
the guys who make arrests.

22:50.866 --> 22:53.232
There's never
been a director
from the Intel side.

22:53.301 --> 22:54.495
Never will be.

22:54.568 --> 22:56.400
Intel's Siberia.
Sir.

22:56.472 --> 22:58.463
The rubber gun squad.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.132
So why did you stay?
Huh?

23:00.575 --> 23:04.342
All those years, why didn't
you transfer into something
with a higher profile?

23:04.880 --> 23:07.815
Because I never cared
about making headlines.

23:07.949 --> 23:09.814
I wanted to make history.
Sorry.

23:10.118 --> 23:15.079
The people Intel tracks
are the ones who want to
wipe America off the map.

23:15.924 --> 23:19.759
Somehow that always meant
a little more to me
than being promoted.

23:25.101 --> 23:28.333
Why are you reading
about Parkinson's?

23:29.106 --> 23:30.265
My mother.

23:30.374 --> 23:31.363
Oh.

23:31.507 --> 23:33.169
For a few years now.

23:34.645 --> 23:36.977
I'm very sorry
to hear about that.

23:41.653 --> 23:42.812
Good morning.

23:48.026 --> 23:49.186
Morning.

23:53.263 --> 23:57.223
Oh, I forgot to mention, sir,
we got a call from Photo,
about a portrait sitting.

23:57.434 --> 23:59.995
You're going up on the
"25 Years of Service" wall.

24:01.905 --> 24:03.567
Imagine that.

24:07.645 --> 24:09.306
Excuse me.

24:15.720 --> 24:16.813
Lord.

24:21.259 --> 24:22.487
Beautiful woman.

24:23.194 --> 24:24.423
You're married.

24:24.497 --> 24:26.158
I can look, can't I?

24:28.033 --> 24:32.868
God expects you
to live your faith, Eric,
at all times.

24:33.539 --> 24:37.202
Besides, I disapprove
of women in pantsuits.

24:38.109 --> 24:39.442
You do?

24:40.079 --> 24:41.808
Men wear pants.

24:42.348 --> 24:45.840
The world doesn't need
any more Hillary Clintons.

24:48.954 --> 24:52.550
I wrote a program
last night using nothing
but ones and zeroes

24:52.691 --> 24:54.353
just to see
if I could do it.

24:55.362 --> 24:59.196
Six-hundred twelve bits
of encryption,
completely unbreakable.

24:59.833 --> 25:02.267
But you get the office
with the window.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.936
Okay, help us.
What do we do?

25:14.981 --> 25:18.816
First, we drop ACS,
which is a relic.

25:18.886 --> 25:20.877
There's not nearly
enough bandwidth.

25:21.522 --> 25:22.717
That's why
you've got agents

25:22.790 --> 25:25.725
who still keep
sensitive information
in cardboard boxes.

25:27.562 --> 25:31.055
You need to move
to an ATM system
instead of the WAN.

25:31.700 --> 25:33.031
An OC-48

25:33.334 --> 25:37.237
with a data rate
of 2.488 megabits.

25:38.607 --> 25:42.543
Start with Linux A-B servers,
which puts us into Red Hat.

25:43.111 --> 25:45.375
IP routers
throughout the building.

25:45.881 --> 25:50.215
Dynamic IP addresses
to hide the system using
the Invicta prototype.

25:51.687 --> 25:53.951
Would it be easier
if I sent this in a memo?

25:54.022 --> 25:56.991
Yes, it would.
Fine. On your desk
in the morning.

25:57.459 --> 25:59.485
You're gonna set up
meetings for me

25:59.562 --> 26:04.225
with the appropriate
systems managers
at the CIA, DIA, NSA,

26:04.299 --> 26:06.633
and the intel agencies
of each armed service.

26:06.703 --> 26:07.864
Yes, sir.

26:07.937 --> 26:11.168
They're all
ahead of us on IT.
We have to study them.

26:11.241 --> 26:15.302
Would you mind if we
book those appointments
through me, Bob?

26:15.879 --> 26:17.177
What for?

26:17.780 --> 26:18.872
Just protocol.

26:19.048 --> 26:20.276
Of course.

26:21.051 --> 26:23.019
And then we switch
offices, right?

26:24.088 --> 26:25.076
Sure.

26:25.189 --> 26:28.420
Perfect.
We're fighting crime
with 19th-century technology,

26:28.493 --> 26:30.483
and he's worried
about protocol.

26:31.095 --> 26:33.961
Set up those meetings.
Leave it up to him,
they'll never happen.

26:34.031 --> 26:35.089
Sir?

26:35.164 --> 26:37.463
That was turf protection
you were just watching
in there.

26:37.535 --> 26:40.504
Didn't you spot it?
Organizational arrogance.

26:40.571 --> 26:43.233
"No, we don't want to learn
anything from the CIA.

26:43.308 --> 26:44.832
"We want the CIA
answering to us."

26:47.312 --> 26:49.109
You know what's going on
behind that door?

26:49.213 --> 26:50.408
No, sir.

26:50.482 --> 26:54.646
Analysts looking
for a spy inside the
intelligence community.

26:54.818 --> 26:56.285
Highest clearance.

26:56.354 --> 26:59.551
But there aren't any
CIA officers in there.
You know why?

26:59.625 --> 27:02.821
Because it's a CIA officer
we're trying to build
a case against.

27:03.395 --> 27:06.853
Now, could the mole be
someone from the Bureau
and not the CIA?

27:06.933 --> 27:07.957
Of course.

27:08.033 --> 27:09.796
Are we actively pursuing
that possibility?

27:09.868 --> 27:11.028
Of course not.

27:11.136 --> 27:13.731
'Cause we're the Bureau,
and the Bureau knows all.

27:19.980 --> 27:25.849
Cooperation is
counter-operational.
And that's the mentality.

27:26.352 --> 27:29.219
Of course, the enemies
of this country
aren't so picky.

27:29.655 --> 27:32.488
They'll work with anyone
who shares their hatred of us.

27:32.992 --> 27:35.655
Bureau hasn't learned
that lesson yet.

27:45.939 --> 27:48.635
He keeps some paintings
in a conference room on 8.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.177
I want you to get
one of them for me.

27:51.211 --> 27:54.613
Sir?
It's two men on a boat.
I want it.

27:55.816 --> 27:58.842
What? You mean Agent Garces?
These are his paintings.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.717
Stop thinking
like a clerk.

28:01.521 --> 28:02.510
They're sitting
in storage.

28:03.458 --> 28:05.449
It's two guys on a boat.

28:08.796 --> 28:11.459
BURROUGHS: Okay.
Where was Hanssen
on March 7, 1991?

28:11.533 --> 28:14.865
The file has him
making a drop at Ellis
at 6:30 p.m.

28:17.973 --> 28:22.774
He badged in at 8:27 a.m.
Badged out at 12:45.

28:22.844 --> 28:25.643
Badged back in at 1:45,

28:25.781 --> 28:28.306
and badged out again at 5:36.

28:28.384 --> 28:32.047
Okay. Let's take a look
at August 12, 1993.

28:38.994 --> 28:41.986
You know why the Soviet
Empire collapsed?

28:45.000 --> 28:46.366
"Good morning"?

28:46.435 --> 28:48.563
I made a career
studying them.

28:49.305 --> 28:50.828
They were smarter
than us.

28:51.741 --> 28:54.539
More devious,
more determined.

28:55.413 --> 28:57.243
So why did they fail?

29:00.649 --> 29:02.209
Godlessness.

29:03.521 --> 29:04.851
Atheism.

29:08.158 --> 29:10.683
I'm on my way
to morning Mass.

29:10.761 --> 29:12.558
You do remember
what Mass is, yes?

29:13.097 --> 29:16.224
The Jesuits at Gonzaga
taught you that much,
didn't they?

29:16.300 --> 29:18.131
Sir, my grandfather
was a deacon.

29:21.004 --> 29:23.098
Well, congratulations.

29:24.643 --> 29:26.974
Now it's time
to join the varsity.

29:31.083 --> 29:35.075
I saw a woman from
Planned Parenthood
on television this morning.

29:35.887 --> 29:39.186
A lesbian, naturally.
Defending gay marriage.

29:40.992 --> 29:43.290
I almost ripped the cable
out of the wall.

29:44.295 --> 29:46.458
Bet she was
wearing pants, huh?

29:52.670 --> 29:56.199
Will your children
be Jesuit-taught,
as you were?

That conversation's
still a few years away.

30:06.552 --> 30:09.077
What is money
compared with
the blessings of family?

30:09.489 --> 30:10.478
Tell me.

30:11.424 --> 30:13.915
My wife was the one...
Good to see you, Bob.

It was my wife
who first brought me here.

30:18.931 --> 30:19.920

30:20.900 --> 30:24.632
I was a Lutheran when we met,
and not much of one.

She saved my life.

30:28.741 --> 30:29.869
Come.

31:19.195 --> 31:21.493
We attend St. Catherine's

It's a traditional
Latin service,

31:24.667 --> 31:26.396

because of your facility

impress him.

32:42.382 --> 32:43.371
Uh-huh.

32:43.583 --> 32:45.709
We also thought
he might like

36:27.147 --> 36:29.309
I want you to feel
at home here.

36:31.419 --> 36:32.681
Is this
your father, sir?

36:35.958 --> 36:37.515
Must've been
proud of you.

36:37.592 --> 36:40.527
FBI. Top Soviet analyst.
Oh, I don't know.

36:40.829 --> 36:42.491
Father wasn't very

36:43.165 --> 36:44.462
impressed by things.

36:46.469 --> 36:48.629
He wanted me
to be a doctor.

36:52.108 --> 36:55.941
He rigged
my first driving test,
the day I turned 16.

36:56.479 --> 36:59.937
Made an arrangement
with my DMV instructor.

37:00.216 --> 37:01.649
So you'd pass?

37:01.717 --> 37:03.207
So I would fail.

37:04.220 --> 37:06.688
He thought it would
toughen me up.

37:10.793 --> 37:12.489
I do that, too,
I suppose.

37:12.663 --> 37:13.994
Test people.

37:14.831 --> 37:16.491
More than I ought to.

37:20.437 --> 37:22.769
Oh! Shoot.
Almost forgot.

37:23.006 --> 37:24.906
I have something for you.

37:26.210 --> 37:28.201
It's everything I could get
on Parkinson's.

37:28.312 --> 37:30.178
Downloaded it
last night.

37:31.248 --> 37:34.582
Been quite a bit of progress
in the last few years.

37:34.719 --> 37:36.618
Didn't know
if you were up on it.

37:36.688 --> 37:39.020
Is there someone
in your family
who has Parkinson's?

37:39.089 --> 37:40.751
No. No, thank God.

37:47.832 --> 37:50.802
You know, sir, I think
you're misunderstood.

37:51.003 --> 37:52.469
Oh? By whom?

37:53.905 --> 37:56.568
By whoever gives out
window offices, for one.

37:59.044 --> 38:01.034
Oh, that's all right.

38:01.713 --> 38:05.046
I think I made
too much fuss of all that.

38:07.219 --> 38:11.156
I'll be gone so soon anyway,
what good would a window
do me now?

38:11.323 --> 38:15.316
Fifty-seven in two months,
that's mandatory retirement.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.725
(DOG BARKING)

38:25.872 --> 38:27.533
No, it's fine.

38:28.074 --> 38:29.404
It's time.

38:31.211 --> 38:33.406
I could stay there
another hundred years,

38:33.580 --> 38:35.445
and still just be
an afterthought.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.819
The perks go to the guys
who play the game,

38:41.454 --> 38:42.944
the ones who politick.

38:46.993 --> 38:50.623
I knew a long time ago
I didn't have
the stomach for that.

38:54.069 --> 38:58.527
But I'll get my portrait
on that 25-year wall, right?

38:59.874 --> 39:01.535
Now, that's something.

39:03.645 --> 39:05.976
Doesn't really matter
much, does it?

39:07.314 --> 39:10.648
The judgments of other men?

39:17.492 --> 39:19.152
I know what I've done.

39:48.825 --> 39:52.125
What's the trouble?
I want to see
what you got on this guy.

39:53.697 --> 39:56.494
Come again?
His Internet postings,
the e-mails.

39:56.566 --> 39:57.760
Your case.

39:58.102 --> 40:00.832
Why?
Because I don't think
you have one.

40:04.073 --> 40:06.668
I can read you in.
I'm authorized to do that.

40:07.077 --> 40:09.545
But it would only put you
at greater risk.
Of what?

40:09.613 --> 40:10.807
What the hell
is all this?

40:10.881 --> 40:13.247
The guy doesn't drink,
doesn't tell dirty jokes.

40:13.317 --> 40:16.878
Goes to church every day,
his wife loves him,
so do his grandkids.

40:16.955 --> 40:18.751
And why the hell
would you hand
a new division

40:18.822 --> 40:20.255
to a guy who's retiring
in two months,

40:20.324 --> 40:22.418
especially if he's
under investigation?

40:22.494 --> 40:23.654
You through?

40:23.728 --> 40:25.355
You know, I think
this whole thing
is cooked.

40:25.429 --> 40:27.488
I think he keeps
shooting his mouth off
about the Bureau

40:27.565 --> 40:28.930
and nobody knows
what to do with him,

40:29.001 --> 40:31.366
so we tag him as
a deviant and run him
out of the building.

40:31.436 --> 40:32.733
It's bullshit.

40:32.804 --> 40:34.771
The whole thing,
it's Kenneth Starr
all over again,

40:34.839 --> 40:38.206
except I'm running around
looking for the blue dress.

40:40.545 --> 40:42.808
You've come to
admire him, I see.

40:43.949 --> 40:45.109
Yes.

40:45.750 --> 40:46.774
Respect him?

40:47.285 --> 40:48.274
Yes.

40:50.122 --> 40:51.783
Well, that was
inevitable.

40:52.725 --> 40:55.216
For our purposes,
it was sort of necessary.

40:57.263 --> 40:58.753
But he's a traitor, Eric.

41:00.533 --> 41:03.866
He started spying
for the Russians,
we think, in 1985.

41:07.406 --> 41:11.069
He's given them
military secrets,
intelligence secrets.

41:12.044 --> 41:14.444
He gave them our
Continuity of Government
Program,

41:14.514 --> 41:16.243
which told them
where the President
would be taken

41:16.316 --> 41:18.408
during a nuclear
or terrorist attack.

41:18.484 --> 41:22.513
And the Vice President.
And the Congress.
And the Cabinet.

41:24.124 --> 41:27.322
The damage he's done
to the U.S. Government
is in the billions.

41:27.395 --> 41:29.363
But that's just
the money part.

41:29.429 --> 41:31.488
He's also
given up lives.

41:32.766 --> 41:34.428
<i>BURROUGHS:

Oh, not that it matters,
but the sexual stuff
is also true.

42:24.052 --> 42:25.850
Irrelevant, but true.

42:26.323 --> 42:28.517
The stories on the Internet,
they're about his wife.

42:28.591 --> 42:30.558

<i>Sweet little anecdotes about

He's a big fan
of strippers, too.
Has been for years.

42:44.909 --> 42:47.069
But his grandchildren
do love him.

42:48.279 --> 42:50.270
That part I can't argue.

42:51.048 --> 42:54.073
There's no such thing as
the "Information Assurance
Division," is there?

42:54.150 --> 42:55.345
No.

42:55.953 --> 42:58.421
We created that
to lure him back
from State.

42:59.123 --> 43:01.181

43:12.703 --> 43:16.696
But this is the worst
breach in the history
of U.S. Intelligence.

43:16.875 --> 43:19.207
Unusual steps
were required.

43:20.645 --> 43:22.636
The good news is,
you got your wish.

43:25.451 --> 43:28.977

He badged out at 5:12,
stopped at his dry cleaners,

43:42.167 --> 43:44.227
drove by dead drop Ellis,
then went home.

with the previous Thursday?

43:46.273 --> 43:48.503

been briefed on this?

43:48.574 --> 43:51.737
If it deals with Russian
sources, then the Agency
has to be briefed on it.

any leave time coming?

43:56.215 --> 43:58.548

Got 50 on the
bigot list so far.

44:01.788 --> 44:03.050
Is the Director involved?

44:03.123 --> 44:06.023
Director's running the case.
He sees your pages every day.

44:06.093 --> 44:07.151
No.

44:07.226 --> 44:08.216
Yes.

44:09.129 --> 44:10.721
Keep them coming,
by the way.

44:10.797 --> 44:14.028

of what Hanssen says in there.

44:14.101 --> 44:15.433
He mumbles.

44:15.970 --> 44:17.960
He does a lot of things,
this guy.

44:18.705 --> 44:22.368
Why don't we just
arrest him?
Can't do that.

44:22.442 --> 44:25.776
He knows the names
and locations of every source
we've ever turned.

44:26.214 --> 44:28.944
If we can't get him to talk,
their lives are all at risk.

caught in the act
of making a drop.

44:37.092 --> 44:38.820
That would give you
the death penalty.

44:38.893 --> 44:40.554
Don't you think
he's earned it?

44:40.628 --> 44:43.529
See you, Dean.
Thanks for coming in, Rich.

take nothing personally.

at the DIA tomorrow
at 2:00, right?

44:54.877 --> 44:56.537
Yeah.
You're driving him?

44:56.778 --> 44:58.006
Yeah.
Good.

44:58.080 --> 45:00.379
We need him out of the office
for at least three hours.

45:00.449 --> 45:02.781
That's when we'll be
sweeping his car.
Okay.

45:03.152 --> 45:06.611
How long will it take you
to download the data card
off his Palm Pilot?

45:06.689 --> 45:09.681
Twenty, 30 minutes,
depending on the level
of encryption.

45:10.126 --> 45:12.616
But you can't.
He never lets it
out of his sight.

45:14.632 --> 45:17.622
Assuming we can separate him
from it, 20 to 30 minutes.

45:17.700 --> 45:18.962
Okay.

45:26.810 --> 45:27.970
What's this?

45:28.177 --> 45:29.771
You want to be
read in, right?

45:33.484 --> 45:34.814
Wait.

45:36.053 --> 45:38.044
What if he's smarter
than I am?

45:41.624 --> 45:44.458
I've never misread anybody
this badly before.

45:46.897 --> 45:48.228
Except maybe you.

45:52.470 --> 45:54.132
A couple of years ago,

45:55.372 --> 45:58.467
the Bureau put together
a task force.

46:01.312 --> 46:03.440
Lots of assets
had been disappearing.

46:04.382 --> 46:08.648
Sources like Motorin,
Martynov. Dozens of them,
vanishing.

46:08.720 --> 46:13.555
So this task force was
formed to find the mole
who was giving them up.

46:13.726 --> 46:17.559
Our best analysts poring
over data for years
looking for the guy,

46:17.629 --> 46:20.622
and they could never
quite find him.

46:23.970 --> 46:26.234
Guess who we put in charge
of the task force?

46:31.676 --> 46:33.507
He was smarter
than all of us.

46:37.517 --> 46:40.042
Actually,
I can live with that part.

46:41.555 --> 46:44.115
It's the idea
that my entire career
has been a waste of time,

46:44.190 --> 46:45.624
that's the part I hate.

46:46.292 --> 46:48.487
Everything I've done
since I got to this office,

46:48.561 --> 46:51.792
everything we've
all been paid to do,
he was undoing it.

46:52.466 --> 46:54.457
We all could have just
stayed home.

Oh.

49:51.986 --> 49:54.146
Bonnie, you really
didn't have to go
to all this trouble.

49:54.955 --> 49:56.320
It's just leftovers.

49:56.390 --> 49:58.449
I guess I just couldn't
stand the thought

49:58.525 --> 50:02.256
of you two ordering
from that Peking Wall
place again.

50:02.496 --> 50:06.024
Even Chinese people
can't eat Chinese
every night, Eric.

50:06.802 --> 50:11.329
Besides, how is this
tiny thing going to give you
a house full of babies,

50:11.406 --> 50:13.898
if you don't put some
protein in her diet?

50:20.649 --> 50:22.879
Would you like
to say grace, Eric?

50:26.889 --> 50:28.152
Sweetheart?

50:35.932 --> 50:38.832
I'm sorry, Jule.
I didn't invite them,
obviously.

50:39.168 --> 50:41.534
But they thought
it would be okay, Eric.

50:41.604 --> 50:44.437
You have to have boundaries,
even with a boss.

50:44.508 --> 50:47.739
And what was that
bullshit about your mom
bumping her head?

50:48.911 --> 50:50.505
It's complicated.

50:51.114 --> 50:54.947
"Complicated,"
as in I wouldn't understand,
or as in you can't tell me?

50:57.855 --> 50:59.185
I'm tired.

51:00.223 --> 51:02.521
I just want to grab
a drink and go to bed.

51:03.660 --> 51:05.525
Are you going to quit?

51:06.330 --> 51:08.093
I want you to quit.

51:08.866 --> 51:12.199
I felt sick
all day, Eric.

51:12.270 --> 51:14.670
It's like you're someone else
when he's around.

51:18.575 --> 51:20.976
I'm sorry it's been
a stressful day for you.

51:21.846 --> 51:23.507
Let's not make it worse.

51:26.518 --> 51:27.848
I don't know.

51:29.353 --> 51:30.843
Maybe it's me.

51:33.859 --> 51:36.487
Maybe you want me
to be someone else, too.

51:36.995 --> 51:39.121
Maybe you want me to be
Bonnie or something.

51:39.197 --> 51:40.357
Knock it off, Jule.

51:40.431 --> 51:42.264
No, that'd be easier
for you, wouldn't it?

51:42.334 --> 51:44.995
If I were more of an FBI
kind of wife, like she is.

51:45.070 --> 51:46.435
I'm not kidding, Juliana...

51:46.504 --> 51:49.702
If I just went to church
every day and wanted to spend
my life being pregnant...

51:49.775 --> 51:51.970
Your parents would
probably love that.

51:52.044 --> 51:54.103
Enough.
Then you wouldn't have
to worry anymore

you been out here?

About an hour or two.

It's freezing.
Why didn't you
let yourself in?

You ever quit
anything, Dad?

52:51.472 --> 52:53.668
Did I ever
quit anything?
Yeah.

52:55.010 --> 53:00.106
I think I gave up
a paper route once.

so early.

your father say?

53:08.824 --> 53:11.258
Nothing.
He just shrugged.

That's what he said to me
the first time I shipped out.

He knew I was scared,
so he just kept it simple.

53:59.911 --> 54:02.243
Maybe I should have
gone to Annapolis.

54:04.147 --> 54:06.708
It always seemed to me

54:08.152 --> 54:10.484
that your joining the Bureau

to Annapolis,

had to do.

there might be some books
I could get for her,

see things better.

take the Lord's name in vain

You do test people too much.

Intelligence Policy,

01:41:21.692 --> 01:41:25.127
but he couldn't thank the guy
we put behind that desk.

01:41:25.795 --> 01:41:27.695
I didn't expect him to.

01:41:30.466 --> 01:41:31.990
I'm headed over
to the field office.

01:41:32.067 --> 01:41:35.161
We still have
two Russian IO's
unaccounted for.

01:41:35.437 --> 01:41:37.928
That mean you won't be
headed over there with me?

01:41:39.073 --> 01:41:40.937
I thought I'd
go home instead.

01:41:43.209 --> 01:41:46.235
You're going to make
agent, Eric. It's set now.

01:41:46.479 --> 01:41:47.878
Isn't that
what you wanted?

01:41:48.247 --> 01:41:49.236
It was.

01:41:49.916 --> 01:41:54.181
Until you came over
to my apartment and saw
the TV dinners and no cat?

01:41:54.453 --> 01:41:55.477
No.

01:41:55.621 --> 01:41:57.919
Most of our agents
are married, you know.

01:41:58.457 --> 01:42:00.549
All their spouses get used
to the life eventually.

01:42:00.626 --> 01:42:02.218
So will Juliana.

01:42:04.963 --> 01:42:06.555
I don't think
I want her to.

01:42:10.468 --> 01:42:11.457
Oh.

01:42:13.972 --> 01:42:15.597
That's different.

01:42:17.506 --> 01:42:18.598
Yeah.

01:42:19.508 --> 01:42:21.703
You do know
what you did here, right?

01:42:23.611 --> 01:42:26.671
That was the worst spy
in American history
you brought down.

01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:30.648
Now you're just
gonna walk away?

01:42:30.919 --> 01:42:33.182
Can you think
of a better time
to walk away?

01:42:33.254 --> 01:42:34.551
Nope.

01:42:37.591 --> 01:42:38.752
So...

01:42:50.303 --> 01:42:52.292
You think it'd be
okay if I...

01:42:53.304 --> 01:42:55.170
Oh, I'd say
you earned it.

01:42:55.473 --> 01:42:56.634
(PEN CLICKING)

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:04.071
Good luck, Eric.

01:43:04.949 --> 01:43:06.211
You, too.

01:43:07.718 --> 01:43:08.707
(DOOR BEEPS)

01:43:10.754 --> 01:43:11.743
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:43:20.730 --> 01:43:21.991
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

01:43:37.476 --> 01:43:38.876
Pray for me.

01:43:43.182 --> 01:43:44.376
I will.
