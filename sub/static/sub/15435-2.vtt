00:01.920 --> 00:04.740
it's been 21 days,and I haven't
heard a single thing from him.

00:04.850 --> 00:07.840
Nora,he'll call.I
promise you,he will call.

00:07.960 --> 00:08.860
You don't know that.

00:08.970 --> 00:10.270
What were you doing
with the bishop so long?

00:10.370 --> 00:12.220
He's sending me on a mission...

00:12.330 --> 00:13.290
to malaysia.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.270
The minute the press found
out that we were engaged,

00:15.390 --> 00:19.500
I went from being a key player in your campaign
to being nothing more than your fiancee.

00:19.600 --> 00:20.700
First fiancee.

00:20.820 --> 00:21.670
And you knew that was coming.

00:21.780 --> 00:26.210
I am guessing that joe did not
just come on to you out of the blue.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.570
Joe,I want you to come home.

00:28.579 --> 00:29.400
Sarah...

00:29.420 --> 00:31.280
you want a divorce?

00:31.290 --> 00:35.440
Justin's unit was returning to
the base,and they hit an I.E.D.

00:35.550 --> 00:36.760
Was anybody hurt?

00:36.860 --> 00:38.720
- There were casualties.
- Oh,god.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.430
attention!

00:43.300 --> 00:46.090
With blank ammunition,load!

00:47.530 --> 00:51.880
Ready!Aim!Fire!

00:51.990 --> 00:55.290
Ready!Aim!Fire!

00:55.410 --> 00:58.670
Ready!Aim!Fire!

00:58.760 --> 01:02.120
Cease fire!

01:02.230 --> 01:05.950
Present arms!

01:45.960 --> 01:49.700
I know I came this close
to losing it just now.

01:49.840 --> 01:50.920
I just...

01:51.030 --> 01:54.850
I mean,these families are so incredibly
brave,and I'm....I'm practically a basket case.

01:54.990 --> 01:58.570
- It's just that ever since
- kitty,justin's plane left ramstein an hour ago.

01:58.690 --> 02:00.610
They're flying him to a
military hospital in san diego.

02:00.730 --> 02:03.080
Kitty,he's coming home.

02:03.190 --> 02:06.820
oh,gosh.Oh,god.Oh.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.930
- How many letters?
- 8 letters,40 down.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.310
You're supposed to knead the
dough,nora,not throttle it.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.430
Oh,stop.It's therapeutic.

02:20.540 --> 02:23.000
- okay,six letters with a
- oh,my god.

02:23.100 --> 02:24.920
Yep,it's kitty.Here.

02:25.060 --> 02:26.100
Talk.

02:26.220 --> 02:29.250
- Uh,have you heard anything?
- He's on his way to san diego.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.160
Oh!Uh,how's his leg?

02:32.280 --> 02:34.660
Uh,well,I guess he's had
a couple of surgeries.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.880
Uh,the doctors here will explain.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.240
A couple?When can we see him?

02:39.380 --> 02:40.530
Tomorrow.

02:40.640 --> 02:44.570
Oh!Oh,gosh!He's coming
home.Justin's coming home.

02:44.770 --> 02:46.600
- Kitty,kitty,bye!
- Bye.Bye,kitty.

02:46.710 --> 02:48.600
Oh,my g-- what did she say
about his leg?I couldn't hear.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.920
I dot know.It doesn't matter.Whatever
it is,we'll deal with it.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.510
- He's coming home.
- Oh,wow.

02:53.630 --> 02:56.520
- He's coming home.
- Oh,man.Oh,wow.

02:56.530 --> 02:58.920
- Please don't say no.
- No.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.350
- Why not?
- "a," I hate family law.

03:01.470 --> 03:03.970
"B," it is way too soon for
either one of you to lawyer up,

03:04.000 --> 03:09.270
and "c," if you and joe get a divorce,I'll be
stuck doing manly chores for you every weekend.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.450
This--this
window's stuck.

03:10.570 --> 03:11.940
No,no,Wait,wait,Try again.

03:12.060 --> 03:14.960
This time,I want you to imagine
your adorable reverend jason

03:15.070 --> 03:17.630
all sweaty in the jungles of madagcar...

03:17.760 --> 03:18.670
he's in malaysia.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.990
And how you pledged to be
true to him until his return...

03:21.090 --> 03:23.710
which means you won't have
sex for months and months...

03:23.820 --> 03:25.660
And months and months and months...

03:25.780 --> 03:28.470
and months and months and months.

03:31.490 --> 03:34.810
Great.Butchest moment of
my life wasted on my sister.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.880
Well,I don't know what
I'm being so smug about.

03:37.010 --> 03:39.360
I'm in the same
lonely,sexlxless boat as you.

03:39.460 --> 03:42.660
Come on,you and joe were shouting
it out on top of the washing machine,

03:42.780 --> 03:45.380
what,a week ago,and you're
still wearing your ring.

03:45.510 --> 03:47.760
You can't start divorce
proceedings that fast.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.210
You'll get the bends.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.590
Well,it's not my idea.

03:51.700 --> 03:55.320
Look,just talk to him.You
know,joe's a reasonable guy.

03:55.450 --> 03:57.940
Try and keep things cordial.

03:59.270 --> 04:00.190
that's your advice?

04:00.300 --> 04:03.590
Yep,and with a family
discount,it'll only cost you...

04:03.710 --> 04:05.780
- 200 bucks.
- Hmm.

04:09.110 --> 04:11.300
- it's kitty.
- Mom.Wanna trade?

04:12.470 --> 04:14.240
- Hey,kitty cat.
- Hi,mom.

04:14.270 --> 04:16.339
- Oh,finally!
- Oh,thank god!

04:16.450 --> 04:17.970
- Have you talked to him yet?
- How's his leg?

04:18.079 --> 04:20.019
- His leg's the same.
- She hasn't talked to him yet.

04:20.140 --> 04:22.150
- No,no,no,she's right here.
- No,no,no,no,he right here.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.180
- Okay,mom wants to talk to you.
- She wants to talk to you.

04:24.290 --> 04:25.270
- Hey,mom.
- Hi.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.580
I know!

04:27.570 --> 04:30.930
Mom shouldn't drive herself down
there.She'll break the land speed record.

04:31.060 --> 04:35.090
Look,I'll take her.We'll stay
the night.Come back tuesday or...

04:35.210 --> 04:37.210
or...or wednesday.

04:37.340 --> 04:40.090
you know what?Actually,uh,maybe
kevin should drive her.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.600
I should stay home with
julia and the baby right now.

04:42.730 --> 04:47.000
Um,besides,justin doesn't need the
whole walker herd stampeding over him.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.810
All right,good.Um,all right,call
me as soon as you know anything.Bye.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.610
thanks.

04:57.410 --> 04:59.530
- nora?
- Yeah.

04:59.540 --> 05:03.990
Oh,my god!I can't believe it!Kevin
just called.I nearly drove off the road!

05:04.840 --> 05:08.370
You know what?You should not be driving
and talking on your cell at the same time.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.330
- How is he?
- Oh,fine...

05:10.450 --> 05:12.920
I guess.I don't know.

05:13.780 --> 05:14.960
He likes this shirt,doesn't ?

05:15.070 --> 05:16.940
Yeah,he wears that one all the time.

05:17.330 --> 05:20.750
Okay,the war moms from my online group
have turned me on to "the heroes handbook" .

05:20.870 --> 05:22.970
It's all about dealing with the wounded.

05:23.080 --> 05:27.130
They say I should bring with me some of his favorite
clothes from home and a pair of old sweatpants.

05:27.240 --> 05:30.890
That way they can cut off one of
the legs if there's a cast or...

05:32.640 --> 05:35.020
- I have a million things to do.
- Oh,let me help you.What can I do?

05:35.130 --> 05:36.220
No.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.290
I want total control right now.

05:38.410 --> 05:43.130
We're driving down there
tomorrow,and,um,depending upon his condition,

05:43.580 --> 05:45.350
they might release him the next day.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.750
Wow.He's coming home in two days?

05:46.880 --> 05:51.760
Yes,but he could be in a wheelchair
for a while,so I've rented a van.

05:51.880 --> 05:56.060
But with you and me and
kitty and kevin and justin...

05:56.190 --> 05:59.090
my god,maybe I should have
rented a damn winnebago.

05:59.210 --> 06:00.440
Wait,sarah's not going?

06:00.570 --> 06:04.110
No,she and joe are getting together
to talk,which is just as well.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.260
We don't want to overwhelm him.

06:06.710 --> 06:09.510
- What?- Nothing.I just--
I don't think I can go.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.750
Oh,no,no,no.You have to go.Come on,now.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.360
You're part of this crazy family.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.330
- We don't want to underwhelm him either.
- Yeah,I know.I--there's just something that

06:15.470 --> 06:19.410
I've been putting off all summer that I
really ould get done before he gets home.

06:19.900 --> 06:22.520
You certainly are being
secretive,young lady.

06:22.640 --> 06:25.070
Well,I guess I really am a
part of this crazy family.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.180
Yeah.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.070
yeah,I guess so.

06:29.270 --> 06:31.800
- we have four live radio things.
- Things?

06:31.910 --> 06:35.340
Uh,interviews,uh,after which we go
to des moines for a tarmac rally.

06:35.470 --> 06:38.830
Oh,and the young republican
thing--speech--is tonight.

06:38.950 --> 06:41.110
- Do I have time for lunch?
- Uh,ten minutes,exactly.

06:41.240 --> 06:45.090
Anyway,we'll do some quick photo ops with some
local supporters at the airport and then...

06:45.180 --> 06:48.600
travis,I now have 9 minutes and 55
seconds left for lunch.Where is it?

06:48.710 --> 06:50.550
Under the newspaper.

06:50.670 --> 06:52.940
After des moines,we go to cedar rapids.

06:53.070 --> 06:55.710
We have two speeches there,an
overnight...are you listening to me?

06:55.830 --> 06:57.110
It's hard not to.You're shouting.

06:57.230 --> 06:59.440
I'm sorry,but we are short on time.

06:59.550 --> 07:00.920
The morning kind of got away from us.

07:01.030 --> 07:02.960
It was a funeral.What
would you like me to do?

07:03.080 --> 07:04.450
You know what?I don't want to sound callous but
-..

07:04.560 --> 07:06.060
that's never stopped you before.

07:06.170 --> 07:11.080
Senator,half the time you're in
the newspaper,you're at a funeral.

07:11.200 --> 07:14.670
We're trying to project
optimism and hope,remember?

07:14.800 --> 07:17.420
You have to distance
yourself from this war.

07:19.020 --> 07:21.050
Okay,honey,I'm--I'm
gonna go.

07:21.170 --> 07:23.780
Uh,where are you going?

07:23.910 --> 07:26.060
- Home.
- Right,of course.

07:26.180 --> 07:30.380
Are you crazy?You don't have a home
anymore.We are running for president.

07:30.510 --> 07:32.990
Travis,do me a favor.Never
have any children.

07:33.110 --> 07:35.140
Ah.Sorry,it's too late.I
already have three.

07:35.270 --> 07:37.560
And you are supposed to do
"good evening des moines"

07:37.690 --> 07:41.220
and the women's republican
thing.You begged me for it.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.460
Right.Tell them I picked out a
wedding cake,and it's vanilla.

07:43.570 --> 07:45.440
- That's all they want to know.
- What about chocolate?

07:45.540 --> 07:49.330
I don't want to get it on my
dress.Good-bye.Mmm.Be safe.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.270
With all due respect,kitty,

07:51.380 --> 07:56.140
have you ever considered that you might be as much
of a distraction to this campaign as you are an asset?

07:56.250 --> 07:59.310
I-I know.Campaigning is
tough for some people,

07:59.430 --> 08:01.020
but whenever something
happens to your family,

08:01.130 --> 08:04.980
- you become completely irresponsible and
- and...and what?

08:05.090 --> 08:06.280
What?

08:06.400 --> 08:12.630
Travis,I get that robert's campaign might possibly
require at least one mercenary who is aent a soul.

08:12.750 --> 08:15.540
I just wish that mercenary was
less predictable and charmless.

08:15.660 --> 08:18.050
It so damages what little
credibility you have.

08:18.170 --> 08:23.630
And,yes,I am going home to see my
brother who just got back from iraq.

08:23.750 --> 08:27.210
You know,maybe--maybe you should go
home one night and tuck your children in.

08:27.320 --> 08:30.870
You know,before you ever dare
call me irresponsible again.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.720
Ta-ta.

- No,thank you.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.560
What kind of mini-mart doesn't
have toffee-tastees?Here.

08:45.670 --> 08:47.940
I don't know,mom.That kind,okay?

08:48.060 --> 08:49.400
Would you please give me
the receipt for the gas?

08:49.530 --> 08:51.990
Apparently,we can bill this
whole trip to the government.

08:52.110 --> 08:55.860
Re--what?So what?"Send your boy off
to war,and we'll pay for the gas"?

08:55.990 --> 08:58.990
God,could you drive a little faster?You're
driving like somebody's grandmother.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.940
somebody's hot grandmother.

09:01.060 --> 09:03.200
Did you notice the garage mechanic
back there was cruising me?

09:03.320 --> 09:06.020
You guys never look  at each
other.You're always cruising.

09:06.030 --> 09:07.340
Remember,kevin,you're taken.

09:07.460 --> 09:08.720
I know,but it's for a whole year.

09:08.850 --> 09:11.120
Doesn't monogamy imply you're
still having sex with someone?

09:11.240 --> 09:13.550
Maybe god is testing you.

09:13.990 --> 09:17.090
You're right.It's jason.He
really does talk to him.

09:19.330 --> 09:21.950
Hey,whoa,whoa,whoa.Come here,silly.

09:22.070 --> 09:23.490
Come here.

09:23.610 --> 09:24.700
Is something burning?

09:24.810 --> 09:29.280
Yeah,I forgot to put water in the
sterilizer and kind of melted it.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.100
How am I supposed to
sterilize her bottles now?

09:31.220 --> 09:33.140
Come on.It's not that big of a deal.

09:33.260 --> 09:36.070
Give her to me.You're
holding the bottle all wrong.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.750
Now she's gonna be colicky all day.

09:37.870 --> 09:41.250
Julia,will you let up
on me a little?Please.

09:41.370 --> 09:42.620
I'm just trying to help.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.420
Well,it doesn't help
when you do it wrong.

09:44.530 --> 09:48.180
Well,if I'm so inept,why'd you
stop me from going to see justin?

09:48.440 --> 09:51.650
You wanna go,go.

09:56.870 --> 09:59.270
Ah,so this is
it-- the kitchen.

09:59.410 --> 10:02.410
God,this is bigger than my apartment,and
you have this all to yourself?

10:02.550 --> 10:05.730
Uh,no,no.The only reason why I'm
here alone right now is because,um,

10:05.840 --> 10:08.220
my whole family went down to san diego.

10:08.330 --> 10:10.890
My half brother justin
just got back from iraq.

10:11.010 --> 10:13.700
- Oh,wow.That's good.
- Yeah,it is.

10:14.390 --> 10:17.220
I can't believe this.I mean,I
know we haven't talked in a while,

10:17.330 --> 10:19.200
but it's like you have
a whole new family.

10:19.320 --> 10:20.960
I know.It's crazy,isn't it?

10:21.080 --> 10:22.910
Is this your dad?

10:23.250 --> 10:26.910
Uh,yeah,my biological father,and
every time I see that picture,

10:27.020 --> 10:29.400
I just want to wipe that
smile right off of his face.

10:29.510 --> 10:31.400
At least your mom has
decent taste in men.

10:31.510 --> 10:34.250
You know,good-looking,wealthy...

10:34.350 --> 10:36.100
married.

10:36.230 --> 10:37.800
So how's sheoing with you bng here?

10:37.890 --> 10:39.110
Oh,she's thrilled.

10:39.230 --> 10:40.500
And by that,you mean...

10:40.600 --> 10:43.970
she hates it,and we're in
one of our distant phases.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.070
Worse than in high school?

10:45.190 --> 10:47.200
No,nothing could be that
bad,but you don't even know.

10:47.290 --> 10:49.520
I mean,you graduated
when I was a freshman...

10:49.640 --> 10:51.290
And you were the good influence.

10:52.130 --> 10:54.140
- Nothing like shauna.
- Oh,yeah.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.610
Your mom despised her.What
did she call her again?

10:56.710 --> 10:59.270
- Um,"truck stop vamp"...
- yes.

10:59.390 --> 11:02.180
Who,by the way,is in new york with
a really good advertising job,so...

11:02.280 --> 11:04.140
oh,how is that possible?

11:04.240 --> 11:07.060
I mean,I have a business degree,and
I can't even find anything good.

11:07.170 --> 11:08.130
You'll find something.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.610
Becca,I got fired from a coffee shop.

11:10.730 --> 11:13.830
I can't even make lattes for a living.

11:14.080 --> 11:17.050
No,you know what?I think my mom
needs someone at the vineyard,

11:17.160 --> 11:21.540
if you're interested.I-I mean,it might just be
like an office manager position or something.

11:21.650 --> 11:24.810
Oh,please.The fact that it has "office"
in the title-- that's a giant step up.

11:24.930 --> 11:27.740
You should come with me.I mean,I-I
have to go there anyways today,so...

11:28.410 --> 11:30.410
you could see her.She'd
be so glad to see you.

11:30.540 --> 11:32.650
- You can ask her about it.
- That would be so awesome.

11:32.780 --> 11:34.980
Oh,are you kidding me?It'd be
nice to have you around more.

11:35.090 --> 11:36.590
I've missed you.

11:36.700 --> 11:39.280
I think it's an insult  to the
citizens  of this great country,

11:39.400 --> 11:43.650
when making a phone call,to havto push a
button  to speak to someone  in english...

11:43.770 --> 11:45.380
oh,god,this is torture.

11:45.510 --> 11:49.070
Kitty,how can you listen
to this submoronic gas bag?

11:49.190 --> 11:50.620
It's my job,mom.

11:50.730 --> 11:54.100
I'm-- luther reeves brings in
ten million loyal listeners,and...

11:54.220 --> 11:56.270
and you know what?80% of them vote.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.640
That doesn't change the fact that
he's still the evil spawn of satan.

11:58.750 --> 12:01.990
He's not evil.He's a perfectly
responsible conservative pundit.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.400
we all know what he is,don't you,folks?

12:03.510 --> 12:05.800
Jimmy,can I get that audio  of
senator mccallister's  speech

12:05.940 --> 12:08.590
today  from his campaign rally  in iowa?

12:12.370 --> 12:14.630
what the hell is that?

12:14.940 --> 12:16.360
Well,there it is,my friends,proof
from the rhino's mouth...

12:16.460 --> 12:17.210
I don't get it.

12:17.310 --> 12:19.520
Robert mccallister is  a
republican in name only.

12:19.640 --> 12:22.450
oh,a rino.I get it.Cute.

12:22.850 --> 12:24.110
Now I'm sure a lot of you  remember
senator mccallister's  lovely bride-

12:24.230 --> 12:28.280
to-be  kitty walker  from her
radio days--  a fine lady,love her.

12:28.410 --> 12:30.380
See,see?He can be very sweet.

12:30.390 --> 12:37.150
You will not believe  the family freak show  a mccallister
presidency  would foist  on an unsuspecting nation.

12:37.270 --> 12:39.890
Let's start  with
the mother-in-law.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.140
I have a stack  of letters to the
editor  this woman has written--

12:43.260 --> 12:47.430
- all strident,incomprehensible  liberal
screeds. - They were not-- they were not strident.

12:47.540 --> 12:48.500
Okay,okay,enough.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.420
No,don't--don't you
dare.Don't you dare.

12:50.530 --> 12:55.940
This harpy essentially says  that
our soldiers in iraq  died in vain.

12:56.050 --> 12:59.260
I never said that.I did not say
that.I said the war was a mistake.

12:59.390 --> 13:02.680
Harpy?He called me
"harpy"?I can't believe this.

13:02.860 --> 13:06.210
Now I expect that kind of talk  from
terrorists,but not from  the first mother-in-law.

13:06.330 --> 13:08.170
Oh!All right.

13:08.300 --> 13:10.710
No,no,no,no!Mom,no!

13:10.720 --> 13:12.640
You are not gonna call him.

13:12.650 --> 13:15.420
Mccallister and miss walker
both have gay brothers--

13:15.540 --> 13:20.300
and hold on  to your airsick
bags,folks--  they're dating.

13:20.730 --> 13:21.550
kind of makes you nostalgic...

13:21.670 --> 13:22.370
- no!
- What's the number?

13:22.480 --> 13:24.470
- Please,kevin,don'T.
- Give me the phone.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.060
- Kevin,stop!
- Bite her,mom.Bite her!

13:26.180 --> 13:27.660
- Give me the phone!
- No.

13:27.780 --> 13:29.250
- Nobody's calling anybody.
- Pull over.

13:29.370 --> 13:31.470
- Now stop.
- Pull over.

13:31.570 --> 13:34.890
The white house is a symbol  of
all that's great  about our country.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.860
I can't stand the thought  of that stately
mansion  being defiled  by mccallister and company.

13:39.980 --> 13:43.180
No,no,no,I'm sorry,but I draw
the line  at the first brothers

13:43.290 --> 13:46.140
doing the gay fandango
in the lincoln bedroom.

13:46.270 --> 13:50.310
- Oh!
- I'll handle this.

13:58.760 --> 13:59.760
hi.

13:59.860 --> 14:00.730
Hey.

14:00.830 --> 14:02.200
What you got there?

14:02.290 --> 14:05.860
Um,nothing.Just,um,some lyrics.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.620
Oh,you're writing
again?Joe,that's great.

14:08.730 --> 14:11.160
Guess I haven't had anything
to write about in a while.

14:11.270 --> 14:13.220
- Mail.
- Thank you.

14:15.280 --> 14:19.580
Listen,joe,I know that we're both in
different places emotionally right now,

14:19.690 --> 14:23.400
but do you really want
to rush into a divorce?

14:23.550 --> 14:26.210
I mean,we've just told the
children that we've separated.

14:26.300 --> 14:35.390
I think we have a responsibility to just slow
down a little and let them get used to things.

14:35.510 --> 14:39.270
You're not wearing your ring.

14:39.720 --> 14:44.110
Um,no.Sarah,I took it off a month ago.

14:45.620 --> 14:49.390
Oh.Um,the reason that I
wanted to talk is that,um...

14:49.490 --> 14:52.680
I know it seems a little soon,uh,but
paula and i have been sort of,

14:52.790 --> 14:55.630
- um,we're spending time with gabe.
- I'm sorry.

14:55.760 --> 15:00.260
You've-- you're
seeing your ex-wife?

15:00.370 --> 15:02.410
It just happened.Um...

15:03.220 --> 15:05.400
gabe was going through some
stuff at school,so paula and I...

15:05.520 --> 15:09.260
wait,wait.So when you and I were on the
washing machine,you and paula had already...

15:09.360 --> 15:12.680
right.We should not have done that.

15:14.850 --> 15:16.590
god.

15:20.950 --> 15:25.250
you know,the really sad thing is...

15:25.690 --> 15:27.800
I loved you,joe.

15:27.900 --> 15:30.260
I mean,I really loved you,

15:30.380 --> 15:33.050
but nothing's ever gonna
make you love yourself.

15:33.060 --> 15:37.450
I wish I had known that when we
met,because I wouldn't have wasted my time.

15:39.250 --> 15:46.430
is exactly because I do love myself
that I am admitting this is over.

15:56.390 --> 16:00.110
I'm sorry that you think
it was a waste of time.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.470
oh,come on,kitty.

16:07.580 --> 16:09.220
The last thing this country needs

16:09.340 --> 16:13.050
is a shrill first mother-in-law
who refuses to support our troops.

16:13.160 --> 16:16.340
oh,wow.Luther,you know,you really
need to get some new material.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.610
I practically invented the
"not supporting our troops"

16:18.740 --> 16:20.690
line four years ago on my show,

16:20.810 --> 16:23.680
and if you keep on using it,I'm
gonna start charging you royalties.

16:23.790 --> 16:25.560
Oh,and you should do your homework.

16:25.660 --> 16:27.630
My mom,who you equated with a terrorist,

16:27.760 --> 16:29.630
happens to be a gold-star mother,

16:29.750 --> 16:32.850
which I think entitles her to voice
her opinion any way she chooses.

16:32.980 --> 16:34.120
You tell him,kitty!

16:34.230 --> 16:37.450
Well,if that's the case,I can only
pray that that heroic young man .

16:37.560 --> 16:41.910
is unaware of his mother's untriotic
and frankly,treasonous rhetoric

16:42.040 --> 16:42.950
Oh!

16:42.960 --> 16:44.320
And as for my
brother,luther--

16:44.340 --> 16:46.990
oh,the one who-hank god--
isn't serving in the military?

16:47.100 --> 16:49.400
Luther,I am happy  to
talk about gay rights.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.960
We might even have some common ground,

16:51.060 --> 16:54.250
but when you start attacking my brother
personally,that is where I draw the line.

16:54.370 --> 16:55.700
The american people are
entitled to know that

16:55.820 --> 16:59.970
the lincoln bedroom might very well be
used for sexual acts forbidden in the bible.

17:00.090 --> 17:01.980
Yeah,well,that wouldn't
be the first time,lucifer.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.910
What was that?Did you just
say abraham lincoln was gay?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.849
- Yes.
- No!

17:06.970 --> 17:10.930
Just pick up a recent history
book,luther,if you can read.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.480
Well,there you go,america.

17:12.569 --> 17:15.470
The mccallister campaign
thinks abe lincoln was gay.

17:15.599 --> 17:18.940
Reach into your pockets
and take out some pennies.

17:19.069 --> 17:21.440
Look at that regal profile.

17:21.550 --> 17:25.089
Now are you gonna stand for his
legacy to be slandered by these people?

17:25.220 --> 17:27.530
You know what,luther?You have
twisted every word I've said.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.720
You and the lunatic fringe that listen
to this drivel have ruined the country

17:30.860 --> 17:33.850
and subverted conservatism
into the ideology of hate.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.890
- Yes.Oh,oh,kitty!
- Beautiful.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.220
- No,really.
- Really?

17:38.880 --> 17:41.770
- very well-saiD.
- Absolutely.

17:45.270 --> 17:47.580
- Oh,this is not good.
- Good luck with that.

17:47.710 --> 17:49.600
- We'll be in the car. -
Yeah,this isn't-- this isn'T...

17:49.720 --> 17:50.680
- Answer it?
- We'll wait for you in the car.

17:50.950 --> 17:53.500
- Are you sure?Mom?
- yeah.

17:54.910 --> 17:56.410
Hi,honey.

17:56.420 --> 17:59.970
I have reputable advisors who are
telling me that you should resign.

18:00.090 --> 18:02.190
Oh,what,and capitulate to luther reeves?

18:02.300 --> 18:03.660
How mad is he?

18:03.780 --> 18:06.400
You gave him our heads
on a silver platter.

18:06.530 --> 18:08.140
Well,didn't you hear what he was saying?

18:08.290 --> 18:10.280
I don't care what he was saying.I
care what you were saying!

18:10.400 --> 18:11.830
Senator?You've gotta take your sea

18:11.840 --> 18:14.340
oh,robert,just listen.I'm--
I love my family.

18:14.450 --> 18:17.630
We're on our way to see justin.It's
a-- it's a very emotional time.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.800
You called abraham lincoln a homosexual!

18:19.940 --> 18:23.100
Well,technically,that was kevin,but--
but,you know,what if he were?

18:23.200 --> 18:25.430
I mean,what would you do?Dismiss
his whole entire presidency?

18:25.560 --> 18:27.450
- That's not the point.
- Senator,we're taxiing.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.680
- You really have to sit down.
- Take off.I'll be fine.Or I won'T.

18:30.700 --> 18:31.390
It doesn't matter anymore.

18:31.400 --> 18:34.510
Robert,sit down and
fasten your seat belt.

18:34.630 --> 18:36.350
Okay,I'm sitting down.

18:36.450 --> 18:39.780
Now,as my communications
director,do you mind telling me

18:39.910 --> 18:42.160
how long  you think it's gonna
be until this campaign can

18:42.290 --> 18:44.950
go back toalking about the
issues instead of your family?

18:45.060 --> 18:47.500
- I made a mess.I will fix it.
- Good.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.550
Otherwise we're gonna be sucking
up to democrats for eight years.

18:50.670 --> 18:52.850
You know what?I have
to go,though,okay?Bye.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.540
Come
here.Man-to-man,

18:58.650 --> 19:01.860
is there any chance you
can get out of this wedding?

19:02.290 --> 19:07.390
No.I'm madly in love with her.

19:08.580 --> 19:12.700
listen,you're an old friend of rebecca's,holly
gave you a glowing recommendation...

19:12.970 --> 19:13.970
that's good enough for me.

19:14.090 --> 19:16.350
I can't tell you how
much I need this job,

19:16.470 --> 19:19.690
but I-I just would feel really weird if
you gave it to me because of nepotism.

19:19.990 --> 19:22.570
How do you think I got this job?

19:22.900 --> 19:26.180
okay.All right.Well,that's
good enough for me.

19:26.190 --> 19:27.250
When do I start?

19:27.380 --> 19:30.300
Well,holly told you we're moving
the offices to the vineyard,right?

19:30.430 --> 19:32.050
Well,if you're free
now,there's a roomful of boxes

19:32.170 --> 19:34.530
- that need to be labeled and catalogued.
- Sure.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.460
Do you need,uh,coffee or
anything before I get started?

19:37.560 --> 19:39.330
No,I can get my own coffee.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.600
Oh,you have no idea how
happy you just made me.

19:41.730 --> 19:43.680
tommy,I want you to see
what I got for justin.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.200
- Oh,I'm sorry,excuse me.
- No,no,no,no,no.

19:46.320 --> 19:48.650
Saul,this is lena,uh,the
new office manager.

19:48.790 --> 19:50.180
You have my deepest condolences.

19:50.770 --> 19:52.760
Funny.So what did you get justin?

19:52.890 --> 19:56.820
I got justin a backgammon set.I
thought I'd teach him how to play.

19:56.850 --> 19:59.680
That's beautiful.It's a bakelite?

19:59.790 --> 20:02.060
Right!From the '40s.It's an antique.

20:02.180 --> 20:05.230
I spoil them,but what the hell?I
don't have children of my own.

20:05.350 --> 20:06.570
- What can I do?
- That's true.

20:06.690 --> 20:10.140
When we were little,saul used to take
us to the most expensive restaurants.

20:10.260 --> 20:11.340
My mom would go nuts.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.520
Well,I obviously did something right.

20:13.630 --> 20:14.910
I taught you how to
read a wineist,didn't I?

20:15.020 --> 20:17.530
- Yeah,I was 9
- oh,god!

20:17.540 --> 20:20.720
I have an aunt like that,and
she doesn't have any kids,either.

20:21.870 --> 20:23.920
You know what?You would really like her.

20:24.100 --> 20:25.780
Oh,come on,lena.

20:25.780 --> 20:28.320
You know me for a second, already
you're setting me up with your aunt?

20:28.320 --> 20:29.700
What are you,crazy or jewish?

20:29.700 --> 20:31.080
Well,one of 'em,at least.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.740
Not that I'm not single.

20:33.970 --> 20:35.540
Wait...

20:35.540 --> 20:37.390
oh,I'm such an idiot.

20:37.390 --> 20:40.990
You know,I do have this other friend-- he's
really handsome,completely age appropriate--

20:42.220 --> 20:43.840
no,no,no,lena!

20:43.840 --> 20:45.880
My uncle's not gay.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.240
Of-- of
course not.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.740
- I am sorry!
- It's okay.

20:49.740 --> 20:52.050
- Oh,god,I just-- I
lost this  job- lena--

20:52.050 --> 20:54.390
lena,come on,it's okay. I'm flattered.

20:54.390 --> 20:56.800
I also like opera and
mid-century furniture.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.600
And the great irony of my life
is that I love women as well.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.980
Okay,so,uh...

21:08.980 --> 21:10.660
you're a little crazy.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.250
Yeah.

21:13.180 --> 21:14.800
oh,god!

21:14.800 --> 21:16.350
I'm sorry I'm late.

21:16.350 --> 21:18.530
I don't know why you're
not down in san diego.

21:18.530 --> 21:22.660
Then again,after this morning, I don't
know why I'm not down in san diego.

21:25.550 --> 21:26.690
did you see joe?

21:26.690 --> 21:28.730
Uh,nora said you were gonna
meet with him this morning.

21:28.730 --> 21:31.070
Yeah,I don't really wanna talk about it.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.540
So... what's up?

21:36.170 --> 21:38.150
The thing is,um...

21:38.810 --> 21:41.050
the thing is,I-I kind of...

21:41.050 --> 21:45.590
wanted to talk to you
about joe and the kiss.

21:45.590 --> 21:47.340
Oh,please,we are so past that.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.940
Yeah,I know,but it's
because I kissed him back.

21:51.540 --> 21:53.470
It wasn't just him.

21:55.140 --> 21:57.400
I may have even led him on a little bit.

21:58.970 --> 22:01.380
I'm so sorry,sarah.
I just-- I...

22:02.590 --> 22:05.710
I talked to justin about
it,and-- and I wanted to tell you.

22:05.710 --> 22:08.430
And I promised him I'd
tell you before he got back.

22:08.430 --> 22:11.900
And-- and I don't know,I thought
it could make a difference.

22:12.780 --> 22:15.120
It might've made a difference
if you'd told me then.

22:16.520 --> 22:18.860
Now you're just telling me
to make yourself feel better,

22:18.860 --> 22:21.840
which is the worst kind of selfishness.

22:28.590 --> 22:29.760
What's going on?

22:29.760 --> 22:31.940
Rebecca's in a confessional mood.

22:32.970 --> 22:35.040
You wanna fill your mom in?

22:35.880 --> 22:37.720
It's nothing she doesn't already know.

22:41.700 --> 22:46.410
Oh,apparently,your dear,deflowered little girl
would've screwed my husband in a heartbeat.

22:47.530 --> 22:50.690
You two,you deserve each other.

22:51.580 --> 22:53.280
Really?

22:53.280 --> 22:55.780
Well,maybe you got
what you deserved,too.

23:01.800 --> 23:06.100
I have a welcome package
here for you with a brochure--

23:07.100 --> 23:08.620
where's the brochure?

23:08.620 --> 23:12.500
Oh! The brochure,a map and
some hpful phone numbers there.

23:12.500 --> 23:16.250
Is there a helpful phone number I
might call to make you move any quicker?

23:16.250 --> 23:20.250
S- sorry,she's just...
very excited to see her son.

23:20.250 --> 23:23.100
It'll be just a minute more while
I print out your security badges.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.220
I can validate your parking receipt.

23:25.220 --> 23:27.950
You know what? We will pay
for our own damn parking.

23:27.950 --> 23:29.750
If I don't get my badge in two seconds,

23:29.750 --> 23:33.990
I'm gonna start screaming obscenities that
will make every sailor in this hospital blush.

23:33.990 --> 23:36.030
- I'm afraid she means it.
- Yes.

23:39.380 --> 23:40.830
Ahem.

23:41.430 --> 23:42.290
- Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
- Thank you!

23:42.290 --> 23:43.410
323.

23:43.410 --> 23:45.390
- okay,relax!
- Jeez.

23:45.390 --> 23:47.030
Sorry.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.310
Hi. Hi.

24:27.310 --> 24:29.220
Oh,I've got you back.

24:29.220 --> 24:30.440
I've got you back.

24:30.440 --> 24:32.280
I'm okay. They barely touched me.

24:33.110 --> 24:34.980
Of course you are.

24:34.980 --> 24:37.070
You guys here to take me home or what?

24:37.070 --> 24:39.330
No,honey,I'm sorry. The...

24:40.250 --> 24:42.090
mom rented@ut your room.

24:42.090 --> 24:44.620
Yeah,uh,to holly harper.

24:44.620 --> 24:47.840
Sorry I'm the one to break
the news. How are you,bro?

24:47.840 --> 24:49.010
Hi.

24:49.010 --> 24:52.820
Hey,if you cry,you'll make 'em
right about gays in the military,bro.

24:53.470 --> 24:54.750
How's the reverend boyfriend?

24:54.750 --> 24:56.980
Oh,he's far,far away,unfortunately.

24:56.980 --> 24:58.090
What's in the I. V. ?

24:58.090 --> 25:00.490
Antibiotics,a little vodka and lime.

25:01.650 --> 25:02.710
Isn't that nice?

25:02.710 --> 25:03.950
Are in you pain?

25:03.950 --> 25:08.650
Uh,no,no,they,uh,they gave me a nerve block,so
I don't feel anything from the waist down,so--

25:08.650 --> 25:12.430
oh,great,at least the female population
of pasadena will be safe for a while.

25:14.220 --> 25:15.300
honey,I'm so sorry.

25:15.300 --> 25:18.190
I wanted to bring you your toffee-tastees,but
they were out of tm everywhere.

25:18.190 --> 25:21.470
Because I think you sent the
entire world supply to iraq.

25:21.470 --> 25:24.800
By the way,mom,they're
tommy's favorites,not mine.

25:24.800 --> 25:27.610
Yeah,well,nora's been
a little wiggy recently.

25:28.410 --> 25:30.320
That's not true. They're your favorites.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.900
Uh,you know,I'm not
gonna argue with you.

25:32.900 --> 25:34.450
You're not?

25:34.450 --> 25:36.940
You're not gonna argue? No being pushy?

25:36.940 --> 25:40.160
Mom,you are so busted. You've been
reading that handbook,haven't you?

25:40.160 --> 25:43.250
Well,yes. I wanna make
everything easy for you.

25:43.250 --> 25:46.630
Sarah and tommy are fixing up the study
so you don't have to deal with the stairs.

25:46.630 --> 25:51.250
And other than that,everything will
be exactly the same when you get home,

25:51.250 --> 25:52.770
just like the handbook says.

25:52.770 --> 25:54.600
Ma,enough about the handbook.

25:54.600 --> 25:57.280
All right,all right,the
handbook said you'd say that.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.930
Are...

25:59.530 --> 26:01.270
come here. I missed you.

26:01.750 --> 26:04.340
I love you,mom. I love you.

26:04.340 --> 26:05.780
I love you,too.

26:05.780 --> 26:07.990
Here we go,coffees all around.

26:07.990 --> 26:09.770
Oh,thank you.

26:09.770 --> 26:13.720
Look,they have a whole chapter on
dealing with your hometown media.

26:13.720 --> 26:15.520
Is that meant to be sarcastic,mother?

26:15.880 --> 26:18.090
Because I have enough to deal
with without you gloating.

26:18.090 --> 26:19.710
I'm not gloating.

26:19.710 --> 26:20.630
Can I gloat?

26:20.630 --> 26:24.080
Feel free,but there goes your
invitation to the inaugural ball.

26:24.080 --> 26:28.600
I don't care. Jason will ask me,and then I'll
waltz all night with the president's brother.

26:30.930 --> 26:32.750
Excuse me? Nora walker?

26:32.750 --> 26:33.530
Yes.

26:33.530 --> 26:35.070
Hi,captain edwards. I'm justin's doctor.

26:35.070 --> 26:36.690
Nice to meet you.

26:37.020 --> 26:39.760
- He's your brother,right?
- Yeah. Yeah,yeah,can we...

26:39.760 --> 26:40.960
take him home?

26:40.960 --> 26:43.650
He is stable,so I'm gonna
sign his discharge papers.

26:43.650 --> 26:45.130
Yeah.

26:45.130 --> 26:49.100
Um,so he will make a full recovery?

26:49.100 --> 26:52.030
With proper care and rehab,yes.

26:52.030 --> 26:54.140
But he still has a long way to go.

26:54.550 --> 26:55.830
But why don't you go ahead and sit?

26:55.830 --> 26:57.200
Thank you.

26:58.010 --> 27:00.210
the knee injury is a little bit thorny.

27:00.210 --> 27:04.980
Uh,the ligaments are all repaired,however,there's
still nerve and tissue damage.

27:04.980 --> 27:08.660
And when that nerve block wears
off,it's gonna hurt like hell.

27:10.030 --> 27:11.970
Well,aren't you gonna
prescribe something?

27:13.180 --> 27:15.170
Yes.

27:15.510 --> 27:21.420
but given justin's history of drug
addiction,weanna be respectful of his desires.

27:21.420 --> 27:24.910
And he is completely
against taking any narcotics.

27:24.910 --> 27:26.920
Well,is that stupid or brave?

27:26.920 --> 27:29.740
He's a good soldier,so it's both.

27:30.560 --> 27:34.900
And though commendable,it
is completely unrealistic.

27:34.900 --> 27:37.400
You see,he has to start
physical therapy right away.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.800
And without something
for the pain,it'S...

27:43.040 --> 27:47.250
but you know what? Um,we don't have
to make any decisions right now,okay?

27:47.800 --> 27:49.580
So I'm gonna release him tomorrow.

27:49.580 --> 27:50.310
Okay.

27:50.310 --> 27:52.910
You guys go and have some dinner.
Pleasure meeting all of you.

27:52.910 --> 27:53.760
Nice meeting you,too.

27:53.760 --> 27:54.710
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:54.710 --> 27:59.100
Um,one more question,doctor. Um,how
long will he be in a wheelchair?

27:59.680 --> 28:01.990
You know,I would keep him
off the leg for a while,

28:01.990 --> 28:04.570
and he's gonna hate you,he's
gonna fight you on it,

28:04.570 --> 28:07.470
but it's best if he doesn't put any
pressure on it for at least two weeks.

28:07.470 --> 28:09.560
- All right.
- Okay,take care.

28:09.560 --> 28:12.160
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

28:14.170 --> 28:18.620
Tommy,this is great!
Perfect! You saved the day.

28:18.620 --> 28:20.080
Thanks.

28:20.670 --> 28:22.060
What was that for?

28:22.060 --> 28:25.410
I don't know,it's just been a while since
somebody said something that nice to me.

28:25.410 --> 28:26.750
Yeah,I know the feeling.

28:26.750 --> 28:27.700
Mommy! Mommy!

28:27.700 --> 28:30.130
- I made uncle justin in his helmet!
- Look what we made!

28:30.130 --> 28:32.150
I made an eagle and a flag,too.

28:32.510 --> 28:34.270
- I can't believe you did this yourselves.
- Daddy even got some balloons.

28:34.270 --> 28:36.070
- He did?
- beautiful,guys.

28:36.070 --> 28:38.280
- Hi.
- Hey.

28:40.310 --> 28:45.470
Hey,um,all right,look,let's go hang
these up,guys. Justin's gonna love 'em.

28:51.910 --> 28:54.580
Thank you,that was... really sweet.

28:55.060 --> 28:57.530
Well... we're still family.

29:31.130 --> 29:34.590
um,kitty,just go inside and
tell everyone to calm down.

29:34.590 --> 29:37.490
The last thing justin needs
right now is a lot of excitement.

29:37.490 --> 29:38.550
- Mom.
- What?

29:38.550 --> 29:40.720
He's hurt his leg,okay?
He doesn't have the vapors.

29:41.870 --> 29:43.540
- I'll go get your stuff.
- Thanks.

29:43.540 --> 29:45.060
I'll get your chair.

29:48.140 --> 29:49.650
You all right?

29:51.620 --> 29:53.890
let's just get you in there,okay?

29:54.370 --> 29:55.450
All right.

29:56.880 --> 30:01.730
Take me to the station

30:01.730 --> 30:04.760
and put me on a train

30:04.760 --> 30:06.920
wait,wait,wait,wait,wait.
What-- what are you doing?

30:06.920 --> 30:08.180
Going inside,mom.

30:08.180 --> 30:09.380
Not with those.

30:09.380 --> 30:11.320
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
put any pressure on my knee.

30:11.320 --> 30:13.070
The doctor was very clear.

30:13.070 --> 30:15.940
You're not to use your
crutches for a while.

30:16.400 --> 30:19.440
I'm not going in there
any other way,mom. Okay?

30:19.440 --> 30:21.850
This is your family. No one cares.

30:21.850 --> 30:25.370
Justin,I don't know what you're doing,but
if you hurt yourself,it's not worth it.

30:25.370 --> 30:27.220
What are you trying to prove?

30:28.940 --> 30:30.880
That I'm still me.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.610
Now I am so poor

30:32.610 --> 30:34.150
hey,man.

30:35.660 --> 30:40.440
But never in my sweet,short life

30:40.440 --> 30:47.280
have I felt like this  before

30:51.660 --> 30:52.510
Isn't she orable?

30:52.510 --> 30:54.180
Wow,she's beautiful,tommy.

30:54.180 --> 30:56.150
I think you e-mailed me
those,like,two weeks ago.

30:56.150 --> 30:58.430
No,no,no. No,no. These are new.

30:58.430 --> 30:59.860
Look at all her new hair.

30:59.860 --> 31:02.680
Oh,she's beautiful,buddy.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.310
Thanks.

31:04.310 --> 31:05.640
here you go,justin.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.640
- Cheeseburger,medium rare.
- Oh,thank you,uncle saul.

31:07.640 --> 31:10.110
No,no,saul. He likes them well-done.
Just put it back on the grill.

31:10.110 --> 31:12.760
Uh,medium-rare is fin
uncle saul. Thank you.

31:14.860 --> 31:17.420
Uh,no thanks.

31:18.470 --> 31:21.280
eyes dark and face so pale

31:23.200 --> 31:25.600
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to eat with everyone staring at me.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.060
Sorry,sorry. Disperse.

31:27.060 --> 31:29.580
You know what? Paige,cooper,let's
go watch uncle tommy eat.

31:29.580 --> 31:33.230
It's so much more fun,and if we get really
close,maybe we'll hear his jaw click.

31:33.230 --> 31:35.010
yeah,get over here,kids.

31:37.990 --> 31:39.310
You want a near beer with that?

31:39.310 --> 31:42.430
Uh,no. Probably still a
little too near for me...

31:42.430 --> 31:44.420
- yeah.
- So just water. Thank you.

31:45.440 --> 31:50.700
Made me look up from
my shoes to show me...

31:50.700 --> 31:53.130
hey,coop,no. Get out,get
out. Get out. It's not a toy.

31:53.130 --> 31:54.880
Hey,coop. Come on.
Grandma's right,out of there.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.420
- no,but I want to.
- That's justin's chair,honey.

31:56.420 --> 31:58.930
Coop,you want a ride,buddy?
Here,I'll give you a ride.

31:58.930 --> 32:00.460
Oh,thanks.

32:02.030 --> 32:04.070
Free wheelchair rides.

32:04.660 --> 32:06.330
All right.

32:06.330 --> 32:07.670
Hey,come on.

32:07.670 --> 32:09.450
Oh,no! No.

32:09.450 --> 32:14.750
Cooper,cooper,cooper. Justin's leg is
hurt,and we have to not touch it,okay?

32:15.240 --> 32:18.800
All right,you know what? Cooper,paige,there's gonna be
wheelchair rides at the front door in 30 seconds,all right?

32:18.800 --> 32:20.130
First one there gets the first ride.

32:20.130 --> 32:21.460
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

32:21.460 --> 32:23.340
Justin,what is the matter with you?
You just got out of the hospital.

32:23.340 --> 32:24.550
- You can't do this.
- Mom,you know what?

32:24.550 --> 32:25.770
I can take care of myself,mom.

32:25.770 --> 32:28.650
Sweetheart,you're home now.
You can let your guard down.

32:28.650 --> 32:31.330
You have to admit you're
hurt. Let me take care of you.

32:31.330 --> 32:33.670
You want to take care
of me? Then back off,mom.

32:34.940 --> 32:36.750
All right?

32:43.150 --> 32:44.900
no.

32:55.310 --> 32:56.850
God,I was afraid this would happen.

32:56.850 --> 33:00.180
He's not the same boy I said
good-bye to four months ago.

33:00.560 --> 33:05.070
No,but he-- he couldn't
be. It's not possible.

33:05.890 --> 33:08.800
You just have to be patient,I guess.

33:10.790 --> 33:12.430
hello!

33:12.430 --> 33:14.000
- Oh,no.
- Oh,god.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.690
Oh,no,no. Okay,no. N
- now,look.

33:16.690 --> 33:20.060
I am-- I am trying to deal with
this luther reeves imbroglio,

33:20.060 --> 33:23.360
but it's just a-- it's a-- well,it's--
it's-- it's not a good time for the family.

33:23.360 --> 33:26.920
She's right. It's a very
complicated family imbroglio...

33:26.920 --> 33:28.840
And-- and while you may or may
not still want to be a part...

33:28.840 --> 33:30.920
Guys,guys,

33:31.400 --> 33:33.930
it's okay. I invited him.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.990
Oh,well...

33:36.990 --> 33:38.650
um,want a hot dog?

33:38.650 --> 33:42.130
I feel kind of stupid. I didn't mean for
you to fly halfway across the country.

33:43.680 --> 33:47.670
Well,don't tell the good citizens of
iowa,but I'd much rather be here with you.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.190
How's it-- how's it
going,the campaign?

33:50.190 --> 33:52.500
We're raising money. Your
sister's raising hell.

33:52.500 --> 33:56.130
Same old,same old. How about you?

33:57.040 --> 34:02.770
I nearly g blown up. Couple of
knee surgeries,the usua the usual?

34:07.070 --> 34:09.690
How's the leg? You in pain?

34:10.690 --> 34:13.510
No,I-I wish I were,you know?

34:13.510 --> 34:16.750
It might distract me. I just feel
like I'm-- I'm crawling out of my skin.

34:17.420 --> 34:19.860
You know,lastime I came
home,I was so stoned,I didn't--

34:19.860 --> 34:21.900
you know,I didn't know
what I was feeling.

34:21.900 --> 34:24.080
Yeah,that's the point of being stoned.

34:24.080 --> 34:25.300
Yeah.

34:25.300 --> 34:28.110
Now I know what I'm missing.

34:28.540 --> 34:32.800
my mom is being so... mom.

34:32.800 --> 34:35.230
You know,I-I-- look,I
feel bad,but she's--

34:35.230 --> 34:37.139
she's driving me
freakin' insane,you know?

34:37.139 --> 34:40.120
All I wanna do is be left alone and...

34:44.080 --> 34:46.510
I'm not gonna lie to you,justin.
It's not gonna be easy.

34:47.290 --> 34:49.909
You know,everyone here,they
don't-- they don't know what I saw.

34:49.909 --> 34:52.489
They don't know what people
are capable of,you know?

34:52.489 --> 34:54.920
I'm just not sure I'll
be able to forget now.

34:57.240 --> 34:59.770
Don'T. You shouldn'T.

35:00.130 --> 35:02.480
That's how we honor the dead.

35:05.340 --> 35:07.710
You'll come home again.

35:08.560 --> 35:10.500
I promise.

35:11.940 --> 35:13.610
Thanks.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.340
So are you still gonna marry kitty?

35:17.340 --> 35:19.390
You heard about the radio thing,huh?

35:19.390 --> 35:22.340
Along with 200 million other people.

35:22.950 --> 35:24.910
I guess. Why not?

35:24.910 --> 35:28.910
Good,because I know she's kinda
stoked about being a mccallister,

35:28.910 --> 35:31.590
but I'm kinda glad you're
gonna become a walker.

35:33.830 --> 35:36.520
Well,then that makes
everything else worth it.

35:38.830 --> 35:41.080
It's almost noon,and he's not up yet.

35:41.080 --> 35:43.870
He's probably still on baghdad
time. I wouldn't wake him,though.

35:43.870 --> 35:45.390
Oh,please.

35:45.390 --> 35:49.510
I've had every single member of
this family instruct me to back off.

35:49.510 --> 35:51.830
I'll only wake him if
the house is on fire.

35:51.830 --> 35:53.360
All right,I gotta go.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.690
Would you tell him that I'm sorry
I missed him,and I'll come back--

35:54.690 --> 35:57.420
wait,wait. Not so
fast,honey. Changes of plans.

35:57.420 --> 35:59.650
You're gonna do the luther
reeves show this afternoon.

35:59.650 --> 36:00.450
No,I'm not.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.640
Kitty,that's a terrible idea. You can't
dignify that clown by talking to him.

36:03.640 --> 36:08.140
You know,I know this is going to come
as a shock to you,but I agree with nora.

36:08.140 --> 36:11.620
This guy's a partisan hack. He's
gonna be onto somebody else next week.

36:11.620 --> 36:13.720
We gotta get off his
radar,not stay on it.

36:13.720 --> 36:14.900
So just call and cancel.

36:14.900 --> 36:18.430
Mom,did you know that there's
a lincoln highway in iowa?

36:18.430 --> 36:19.050
No.

36:19.050 --> 36:22.530
Oh,yeah,stretches all the way across the
state,from potawatomi to the illinois border.

36:22.530 --> 36:24.710
We drive it many times
between campaign stops,

36:24.710 --> 36:29.900
but I just found out that there's gonna be
a movement of thousands of angry reeves fans

36:29.900 --> 36:32.210
to collect lincoln pennies,

36:32.210 --> 36:35.990
stand at the side of the road and
pelt robert with them as he drives by.

36:35.990 --> 36:37.510
Good god.

36:38.220 --> 36:39.870
We don't care what
those crazy people think.

36:39.870 --> 36:44.700
Well,so far,there's,um,cnn,"the wall
street journal," "the daily show"--

36:44.700 --> 36:46.750
this whole thing makes
me want to move to france.

36:46.750 --> 36:48.760
It would be so helpful if you would.

36:49.730 --> 36:51.440
And take kitty with you.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.690
All right,all right,I'll do it.

36:54.540 --> 36:57.440
Good. Now don't let him suck
you into a conversation about me.

36:57.440 --> 37:01.140
Whatever he says,whatever he asks,you
just steer it right back to the issues.

37:01.140 --> 37:02.680
Oh,and don't apologize.

37:02.680 --> 37:05.520
The fact that you're there
already is an apology enough.

37:05.520 --> 37:06.710
Let's get it over with.

37:06.710 --> 37:08.850
Will you give him one message for me?

37:08.850 --> 37:10.590
no.

37:15.110 --> 37:15.910
heY.

37:15.910 --> 37:17.320
Hey.

37:21.360 --> 37:23.510
I've been trying to call you.

37:24.870 --> 37:27.430
Do you wanna talk about what happened?

37:27.890 --> 37:29.660
What's there to talk about?

37:30.560 --> 37:34.510
I let everyone believe he was a lecherous
old man,and I got what I deserved.

37:34.510 --> 37:37.850
Oh,sweetie,joe is not old,

37:37.850 --> 37:40.560
and that marriage was
already beyond repair.

37:40.560 --> 37:42.680
Mom,why do you do that?

37:42.680 --> 37:44.680
Why do you let me off
the hook like that?

37:44.680 --> 37:47.480
Because who am i to judge you?

37:48.540 --> 37:51.080
But there are
consequences to everything.

37:51.080 --> 37:54.310
I know,and I'm sorry
you're feeling them.

37:57.160 --> 37:59.010
what was I thinking?

37:59.650 --> 38:04.320
It's like I've been pretending to be a
part of that family all summer,and I'm not.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.550
It's pathetic.

38:07.550 --> 38:09.550
No,becca.

38:09.550 --> 38:13.480
What is pathetic is
that I did this to you.

38:13.880 --> 38:16.320
I am sorry.

38:21.630 --> 38:23.050
I'm sorry.

38:24.940 --> 38:25.710
I love you.

38:29.730 --> 38:32.870
so let me ask you what all
of america is dying to know.

38:32.870 --> 38:36.310
Were you as shocked as I was
when your fiancee,kitty walker,

38:36.310 --> 38:38.680
accused honest abe of being a gay?

38:38.680 --> 38:40.990
I was shocked by a lot of
things that were said that day.

38:40.990 --> 38:43.650
I think what america's
responding to is--

38:43.650 --> 38:46.650
is the whole tone your
fiancee took when she called.

38:46.650 --> 38:48.790
I'd like to hear what her
other feels about the war.

38:48.790 --> 38:51.900
I can't imagine he shares
any of his mother's views.

38:51.900 --> 38:55.740
Look,I don't share many of my
future mother-in-law's views either,

38:55.740 --> 39:00.240
but she's not unpatriotic,and she's
certainly not treasonous-- your words.

39:00.240 --> 39:01.370
And I stand by them.

39:01.370 --> 39:03.200
Well,I'm not gonna give you
an education on discourse,

39:03.200 --> 39:09.070
but if you think that I came on here today to
distance myself from kitty or her liberal mother.

39:09.070 --> 39:14.210
or gay brother or my gay brother,for that
matter,well,luther,you have got to be nuts

39:14.210 --> 39:16.460
Well,that's extremely disappointing

39:16.460 --> 39:18.620
because I believe america's
looking for a leader

39:18.620 --> 39:23.010
who has the courage to stand up for
what's right and to point out what's wrong.

39:23.010 --> 39:25.840
And I think america's looking for
somebody who knows the difference,

39:25.840 --> 39:29.490
and the only way to do that is
by listening,not antagonizing.

39:29.930 --> 39:34.640
My future in-laws are very different
from me and different from each other.

39:34.830 --> 39:38.360
So they are,by
definition,my greatest asset,

39:38.360 --> 39:43.500
because they remind me that we are
all part of a larger american family

39:43.500 --> 39:46.950
and that no one is irrelevant
and no one should be ignored.

39:46.950 --> 39:51.440
And,luther,I think the bigger question
is not why I feel a part of them,

39:51.440 --> 39:53.890
but why you don'T.

39:55.650 --> 39:58.850
Not bad. It's very risky to
shoot from the hip le that.

39:58.850 --> 40:00.730
I mean,it worked this
time,but it's a dangerous game.

40:00.730 --> 40:03.520
And you're lucky it wasn't on
television,'cause you have a spot on your tie.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.590
You should be fawning all over me,

40:05.590 --> 40:08.170
considering I just single-handedly
cleaned up your mess,right?

40:08.170 --> 40:09.500
Just one more thing.

40:09.500 --> 40:12.340
Why am I always the fiancee,and
you're the future husband?

40:12.340 --> 40:15.520
You're a fiance,too.
Same word,one less "E.

40:15.520 --> 40:16.660
- " Are you done?
- That's it.

40:16.660 --> 40:18.230
Good.

40:18.230 --> 40:21.050
I'm speechless. Speechless.

40:21.050 --> 40:24.890
Well,that's unfortunate,considering
we're still in the middle of a campaign.

40:25.310 --> 40:28.970
Okay,I'll roll with the
punches. It hurts,but I'll roll.

40:28.970 --> 40:35.130
Oh,um,and about the other thing,my
answer-- when soldiers stop dying.

40:36.130 --> 40:36.990
What?

40:36.990 --> 40:39.100
That's when I'll stop going to funerals.

I'm fine,mom. Will you

It wore off,didn't it,the nerve block?

you just please leave?
