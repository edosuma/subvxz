00:18.380 --> 00:21.500
No! No! No! Where is she?!

00:22.740 --> 00:25.340
Please! Give her back!

00:29.740 --> 00:32.900
Ah, Nikki. This is
Detective Inspector Rory Goodchild

00:32.940 --> 00:35.700
and Agent Pia Butler,
who's from Immigration Enforcement.

00:35.740 --> 00:37.340
They need our help with an ID.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.500
Is it my mother's?

01:04.060 --> 01:06.339
Hm. You look prosperous.

01:06.340 --> 01:08.980
Don't. You show off your money,
looking like this. Hm?

01:13.300 --> 01:17.340
Please! Please!
Where is my daughter?

01:17.380 --> 01:19.860
Please! I paid you
what you asked for!

01:19.900 --> 01:23.060
PLEASE! We have nothing left!

01:25.220 --> 01:27.739
What was that? He's insane.

01:27.740 --> 01:29.740
He's desperate, not insane.
What was it?

01:29.780 --> 01:31.419
I don't know.

01:31.420 --> 01:33.139
I pay you to know.

01:33.140 --> 01:35.019
Loyalty is important to me, Jamal.

01:35.020 --> 01:36.820
If I find out you've put me
in danger,

01:36.860 --> 01:39.260
I'll kill you, and your friends.

01:42.260 --> 01:44.340
Why didn't you tell me
about the van?!

01:44.380 --> 01:46.980
I'm sorry, Jamal, I should have!
I'm sorry!

01:47.020 --> 01:50.460
He does this in public! In public!

01:53.700 --> 01:55.820
I left the van where Kali told me.

01:55.860 --> 01:57.460
You let the new guy do it?!

02:00.220 --> 02:02.620
You should have told me.

02:02.660 --> 02:04.580
Send me the place you left it.

02:05.940 --> 02:07.420
And get another van!

02:13.620 --> 02:15.179
What's this about?

02:15.180 --> 02:17.420
Family members are missing.

02:17.460 --> 02:19.500
Police think it's some sort of
extortion racket.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.419
The finger... is proof of life.

02:22.420 --> 02:24.380
Or proof of torture.

02:51.420 --> 02:59.100
♪ Testator silens

02:59.140 --> 03:06.859
♪ Costestes e spiritu

03:06.860 --> 03:12.340
♪ Silentium. ♪

03:26.740 --> 03:28.419
X-rays?

03:28.420 --> 03:29.980
Thanks.

03:45.100 --> 03:48.460
Traumatic head injuries consistent
with a fall from a great height.

03:49.940 --> 03:52.340
There are multiple
comminuted skull fractures

03:52.380 --> 03:55.780
with fracture contusions
and lacerations of the brain.

03:55.820 --> 03:58.420
There are fractures
to the orbital plates

03:58.460 --> 04:01.380
and associated
periorbital haemorrhages.

04:01.420 --> 04:05.540
Right, so the plants blocked
the CCTV view from the terrace.

04:05.580 --> 04:08.580
So, no-one one saw him fall?
No. We haven't found any witnesses.

04:08.620 --> 04:10.220
And no-one heard screams?

04:11.860 --> 04:13.860
Jumpers don't scream.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.499
You think it's suicide?

04:15.500 --> 04:18.140
We think he went over
the barrier there

04:18.180 --> 04:20.860
and he stepped up on the edge of
the planter and threw himself over.

04:22.820 --> 04:24.379
Do we have a name yet?

04:24.380 --> 04:26.460
Jamal al Sham.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.379
What do you think?

04:29.380 --> 04:35.180
Well, it's a theory, but I don't see
any sign of a footprint.

04:37.460 --> 04:39.460
Right, come on, let's go. Come on!

04:39.500 --> 04:41.859
If you had to choose,
would you rather be

04:41.860 --> 04:44.940
looking down at the ground
as you fell, or looking up?

04:44.980 --> 04:47.140
Do you really think I'm going
to play that game?

04:47.180 --> 04:49.500
I hadn't really developed a view.

04:49.540 --> 04:52.620
Suicide, assisted suicide,
I don't believe in it.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.500
I don't think Jamal did either.

04:56.540 --> 04:59.140
Well, according to the police,
you're wrong.

05:25.980 --> 05:27.660
Thomas?

05:28.860 --> 05:33.060
He's got subha, Muslim prayer beads,
on his personal effects list.

05:33.100 --> 05:36.139
You're sure they're prayer beads?

05:36.140 --> 05:37.860
33 beads.

05:37.900 --> 05:41.180
He uses them to count as he recites
the words of the Dhikr.

05:41.220 --> 05:43.660
So it's reasonable to think
he was somewhat devout.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.460
What's that mean exactly?

05:45.500 --> 05:46.699
The Prophet said,

05:46.700 --> 05:49.899
"Whoever throws himself down
from a mountain and kills himself

05:49.900 --> 05:51.619
"will be in the Fire of Hell,

05:51.620 --> 05:54.219
"throwing himself down therein
for ever and ever".

05:54.220 --> 05:56.300
In Islam, suicide is a sin.

05:57.700 --> 06:00.316
Did you notice any blood at the spot
where he went over the barrier?

06:00.340 --> 06:03.340
Er... no.
No obvious blood or footprints.

06:03.380 --> 06:05.580
Detective Renick thought
he was likely to be a jumper.

06:05.620 --> 06:08.220
But you looked? Er...

06:08.260 --> 06:09.460
What did he miss?

06:09.500 --> 06:12.260
I think he was stabbed in the neck.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.500
The wound suggests
a narrow symmetrical blade

06:14.540 --> 06:16.140
about 15mm in width.

06:16.180 --> 06:18.260
There was nothing that I found
on or around the body

06:18.300 --> 06:19.419
which can account for it,

06:19.420 --> 06:21.420
and I think he was
stabbed before he fell.

06:21.460 --> 06:24.219
It's an arterial wound.
There should be blood.

06:24.220 --> 06:25.540
I'm on it.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.819
We both walked through here earlier.

06:32.820 --> 06:34.420
Have you found something?

06:48.500 --> 06:50.220
What? I've got an idea.

07:27.060 --> 07:31.300
..fracture contusions
and lacerations of the brain.

07:31.340 --> 07:34.900
There are fractures to the
orbital plates and associated...

07:56.700 --> 07:58.979
DCI Goodchild, please.

07:58.980 --> 08:01.379
There's an absence
of lysosomal enzymes.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.620
The finger was cut
from a living person.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.659
The girl Akka's DNA results.

08:06.660 --> 08:09.060
Swab is the column on the left,
tissue on the right.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.500
Indicative result here.

08:10.540 --> 08:12.140
Akka is not a blood relative.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.980
Any chance they could be wrong?
Unlikely.

08:18.020 --> 08:20.139
But there is always a chance.

08:20.140 --> 08:22.100
Let's go tell her.

08:30.820 --> 08:33.820
I sent her a message on the app
she uses, told her we had a result.

08:33.860 --> 08:35.700
She told me where she lives.

08:35.740 --> 08:38.539
Akka's illegal,
we contacted Immigration.

08:39.980 --> 08:41.179
It's a joint operation.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.860
Why do you think they're running?

08:54.860 --> 08:57.899
Illegal workers.
I thought we were trying to help?

08:57.900 --> 08:59.459
We are.

08:59.460 --> 09:02.179
Everyone deserves to enjoy
the full protection of the law.

09:02.180 --> 09:03.820
Protection?

09:03.860 --> 09:06.580
Akka's family paid to smuggle
her mother into Britain.

09:06.620 --> 09:08.596
Then they get a message saying
they need to pay more

09:08.620 --> 09:09.900
if they want to see her alive.

09:09.940 --> 09:13.099
If you're outside the law,
it's easy to be victimised.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.500
We're bringing them to
the bosom of justice.

09:15.540 --> 09:18.860
Nice van. Is that what low-key
looks like to you?

09:18.900 --> 09:20.340
They ran.

09:20.380 --> 09:23.579
What house is she in?
End of the street, on the right.

09:23.580 --> 09:25.700
I know, you wish you parked closer.

09:30.140 --> 09:32.579
So, you didn't tell Akka
the outcome of the test?

09:32.580 --> 09:34.980
Not yet. But you told her
I was coming? I did.

09:35.020 --> 09:38.059
I figured her need to know would
mean she and her family showed up.

09:38.060 --> 09:39.300
You're using me as bait?

09:40.740 --> 09:42.540
Yeah, all right, call it that.

09:42.580 --> 09:45.820
I'm not interested in sending them
back where they came from,

09:45.860 --> 09:47.340
that's Butler's party.

09:47.380 --> 09:49.700
I want to stop the criminals
exploiting them.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.100
They're coming! They're coming here!

10:04.140 --> 10:06.060
How do they know?
We can't run! We have to hide!

10:06.100 --> 10:08.740
It's OK. OK? How is it OK?

10:08.780 --> 10:11.740
I... I-I wanted to know
if it was her.

10:11.780 --> 10:13.780
You went to the police?!
They did tests!

10:13.820 --> 10:15.859
Did you tell them where we live?!
You trusted them?!

10:15.860 --> 10:18.060
I wanted to know if Mama
is still alive!

10:18.100 --> 10:20.939
There is no-one you can trust!
Don't you want to know?!

10:20.940 --> 10:23.780
She's dead! They're all dead!
Everyone is dead!

10:23.820 --> 10:28.020
We don't know that. What does it
matter? We cannot pay them!

10:28.060 --> 10:30.540
We have nothing left.
They have taken everything!

10:32.820 --> 10:34.539
Let them die in your heart, Akka.

10:34.540 --> 10:38.259
Your mother and brother
are the past.

10:38.260 --> 10:39.580
Don't think about them.

10:41.660 --> 10:43.060
They're coming for us!

10:45.740 --> 10:47.340
We do what we have to do.

10:51.220 --> 10:53.380
Akka? He knows you?

10:58.700 --> 11:02.180
Akka, it's me.
I've brought Dr Alexander with me.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.020
Back alley.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.940
Akka? It's Dr Alexander.

11:20.260 --> 11:21.540
Hi.

11:26.340 --> 11:27.940
Can we come in?

11:33.780 --> 11:35.540
Argh!

11:35.580 --> 11:37.460
Don't do anything!

11:39.580 --> 11:41.380
I'll cut her throat! Butler! Don't!

11:43.220 --> 11:44.579
The toilet!

11:44.580 --> 11:46.220
Get in!

11:46.260 --> 11:49.180
The toilet, get in!
Come on! Now! Get in!

11:49.220 --> 11:50.500
Come on!

11:51.940 --> 11:53.940
Lock it! Quickly, we go!

11:55.260 --> 11:56.980
You're not kidnappers. Shut up!

11:57.020 --> 11:58.820
Are you going to kill me?

11:58.860 --> 12:00.420
Don't do this!

12:03.100 --> 12:04.500
She'll slow us down.

12:13.300 --> 12:25.660
Come on!

12:28.540 --> 12:32.300
Don't! I will cut you and leave you
to bleed to death! Please!

12:32.340 --> 12:35.340
We are not the same as them.
We are not them.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.820
Let her go. She's slowing us down!

12:37.860 --> 12:39.139
Let's go!

12:45.140 --> 12:46.660
Akka, come on!

12:55.100 --> 12:56.540
Are you all right?

12:57.580 --> 12:59.340
Call an ambulance. Where?

13:01.820 --> 13:03.420
Let me see. Let me see.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.060
Can you stand? (Yeah.)

13:09.980 --> 13:11.340
OK. All right.

13:12.980 --> 13:14.260
(OK.)

14:39.300 --> 14:42.100
He found blood spray
on three windows.

14:42.140 --> 14:45.660
Arterial blood. Spurting as he fell,
decreasing in volume.

14:48.260 --> 14:50.740
Good look. Cut myself shaving.

14:53.140 --> 14:56.099
DCI Goodchild called, wanted
to make sure you're all right.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.260
I'm fine. That's what I told him.

14:58.300 --> 15:00.259
You might have asked me first. Why?

15:00.260 --> 15:02.660
Even if you weren't,
you'd say you were. I know you.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.260
He's right.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.939
DI Renick's in reception.
Meeting room?

15:06.940 --> 15:08.499
Yep. Come on.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.580
Notice how men always think
they know us?

15:11.620 --> 15:13.740
Probably best to leave them
in the dark.

15:16.300 --> 15:18.300
He was stabbed before he fell

15:18.340 --> 15:19.979
and was still alive on the way down.

15:19.980 --> 15:22.500
You're sure the lack of blood
on the roof doesn't bother you?

15:22.540 --> 15:25.419
When he was stabbed,
the natural reaction would be

15:25.420 --> 15:28.660
to grab his neck
to try and stop the bleeding.

15:28.700 --> 15:32.500
He succeeded in reducing blood flow,
but, with only one free hand,

15:32.540 --> 15:34.819
was vulnerable to being shoved
over the barrier.

15:34.820 --> 15:36.780
He didn't jump, he was pushed.

15:36.820 --> 15:38.779
Well, why didn't he scream?

15:38.780 --> 15:41.979
Speckled pattern on the lungs.
He inhaled blood.

15:41.980 --> 15:45.939
I looked at the hyoid bone,
the knife lacerated his larynx.

15:45.940 --> 15:49.300
You can see the markings of
the blade of the knife just here.

15:49.340 --> 15:50.780
I'll finish the postmortem

15:50.820 --> 15:53.260
and look for contact
and trace samples of his assailant.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.419
You may need to explain the delay
to next of kin.

15:55.420 --> 15:57.460
Well, we haven't identified
next of kin.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.940
Jamal was a French national
from Marseille.

15:59.980 --> 16:02.780
French police are, er...
Yeah, they're struggling.

16:02.820 --> 16:06.059
His personal effects lead us believe
he was a practising Muslim.

16:06.060 --> 16:07.620
He was in a bar.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.020
Cou-cou?

16:30.060 --> 16:31.260
Cou?

16:32.860 --> 16:35.180
Je peux t'aider, hein?

16:50.980 --> 16:52.540
Are you a righteous girl?

17:08.220 --> 17:10.619
Stay here, petite soeur.

17:20.060 --> 17:23.579
The fall didn't do Jamal's phone
any favours.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.660
It's dead. Try plugging it in.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.300
Hm! Oh, don't be smug.

17:38.900 --> 17:42.939
OK, check locations of phone,
last screen, apps used,

17:42.940 --> 17:45.460
text messages, access e-mail server.

17:45.500 --> 17:46.979
It's locked. Unlock it!

17:46.980 --> 17:50.620
Try 1234,
or the old four zeros trick.

17:50.660 --> 17:52.660
"Eight tries left
before you wipe the phone."

17:52.700 --> 17:53.900
4321.

17:57.700 --> 17:58.980
Where are you going?

18:14.020 --> 18:16.020
I need to get into this phone.

18:34.140 --> 18:36.419
The human body is a capacitor.

18:36.420 --> 18:38.380
Yes. And your point is...?

18:40.420 --> 18:42.499
The finger needs an electric pulse

18:42.500 --> 18:45.380
of, say, 100 picofarads
to fool the sensor.

19:02.380 --> 19:04.060
Finger, phone.

19:08.060 --> 19:09.620
Here goes...

19:12.300 --> 19:13.380
Bingo!

19:19.460 --> 19:21.099
Jack? Hm?

19:21.100 --> 19:26.900
Last message he received - A267B94.

19:26.940 --> 19:29.780
A password?
Password? For what?

19:29.820 --> 19:33.420
I don't know - Wi-Fi? A website?
I don't know.

19:33.460 --> 19:36.260
Who's it from? Unknown.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.500
The last screen on his phone
was the CloudHookUp app.

19:42.580 --> 19:45.299
19:30. He was meeting a woman.

19:45.300 --> 19:48.020
Janna. Mm. Look at the messages.

19:48.060 --> 19:50.660
She asks him to meet her
on the roof garden.

19:50.700 --> 19:52.180
Mm-hm.

19:55.300 --> 19:56.780
Detective Inspector Renick?

20:02.700 --> 20:06.140
There's Jamal walking to the garden.
19:31.

20:11.220 --> 20:13.020
We should have seen her.

20:13.060 --> 20:14.659
She was waiting for him.

20:14.660 --> 20:19.020
We'll go back through the credit
card list. Show them a photo.

20:19.060 --> 20:20.820
Why isn't she on the CCTV?

20:26.780 --> 20:28.220
Get the licence plates.

20:49.420 --> 20:50.500
I trusted you.

20:52.460 --> 20:53.660
Oi!

21:20.820 --> 21:23.100
Is it my mother's finger?

21:23.140 --> 21:24.940
There is no-one else.

21:24.980 --> 21:27.540
How did you get in?
Just tell me. Is it my mother?

21:27.580 --> 21:29.019
What's happened to you?

21:29.020 --> 21:31.179
Just tell me, please.

21:31.180 --> 21:34.900
No. The DNA doesn't match.
It's not your mother's.

21:44.860 --> 21:47.580
My grandfather... my brother...

21:49.540 --> 21:50.540
..they were right...

21:52.940 --> 21:54.380
Sorry. I don't know what to say.

21:54.420 --> 21:56.380
I don't know if that's
good or bad news.

21:56.420 --> 22:00.700
The message said they had her.
They wanted money.

22:03.300 --> 22:05.660
We have no more money.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.180
We have nothing.

22:08.220 --> 22:10.820
Everything is gone.

22:13.220 --> 22:15.820
She... she is gone.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.660
She could be alive...

22:22.620 --> 22:25.620
My grandfather,
he brought the war with him.

22:26.700 --> 22:29.020
He will never escape it.

22:29.060 --> 22:32.340
He says it is better to tear
the hope from your heart.

22:32.380 --> 22:35.300
It is easier to live without hope.

22:35.340 --> 22:37.100
Then there will be no pain.

22:39.940 --> 22:41.500
Who hurt you?

22:44.980 --> 22:47.380
Why did you bring
the police with you?

22:48.860 --> 22:50.500
I didn't...

22:50.540 --> 22:53.300
You came with the police
like we are criminals.

22:53.340 --> 22:54.900
You broke the law.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.899
Some laws are unfair.

22:56.900 --> 22:59.380
You can't pick and choose
the laws you obey.

22:59.420 --> 23:03.379
Why not? I know what is just.

23:03.380 --> 23:07.579
Being able to live
without being afraid is just.

23:07.580 --> 23:11.540
Laws are the tools of justice.
They protect us.

23:13.020 --> 23:15.420
The police didn't come
to protect me.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.460
They came to get me.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.700
Will you let me look at your face?

23:26.420 --> 23:29.820
I think you may have fractured
your cheek bone.

23:31.100 --> 23:36.779
These men, these men
who promised to bring us here,

23:36.780 --> 23:39.779
who promised us a new life...

23:39.780 --> 23:45.700
They stole from us, they cheated us,
they lied to us.

23:47.580 --> 23:50.660
And we, we are the criminals?

23:58.140 --> 23:59.620
Who did this to you?

24:04.820 --> 24:07.060
Will you let me look at your arm?

24:10.700 --> 24:12.380
Can you move your fingers?

24:17.620 --> 24:21.220
You've broken your arm.
You need to come with me.

24:22.900 --> 24:24.500
You can trust me.

24:37.940 --> 24:39.100
Hey.

24:42.620 --> 24:44.380
Where are you from?

24:45.780 --> 24:46.780
Syria.

24:48.940 --> 24:50.380
So am I!

24:50.420 --> 24:51.820
Everyone is from Syria.

24:53.740 --> 24:55.060
Where are you going to?

24:56.820 --> 24:58.820
England. London.

25:00.460 --> 25:02.300
And you are going by yourself?

25:03.940 --> 25:07.579
My mother. My brother and sister.

25:07.580 --> 25:09.420
They are waiting for me.

25:12.580 --> 25:14.500
Recite from the Koran.

25:22.420 --> 25:23.980
You know the Koran?

25:25.780 --> 25:28.060
You are a righteous girl?

25:29.860 --> 25:31.340
So recite Al-Fatihah...

25:35.420 --> 25:36.860
Recite it!

25:38.660 --> 25:40.420
There's one like we need...

25:40.460 --> 25:41.460
Just get the plates.

25:44.140 --> 25:46.179
What you waiting for?

25:46.180 --> 25:48.380
Asking for "guidance
and assistance".

25:48.420 --> 25:50.299
You don't believe in anything?

25:50.300 --> 25:51.459
"Faith" is a power.

25:51.460 --> 25:53.219
Shut up. Get over here.

25:53.220 --> 25:54.220
Get on the bin.

25:57.340 --> 25:58.499
What you doing, Kali?

25:58.500 --> 26:00.980
Take off your jacket! Do it!

26:08.420 --> 26:12.140
Don't look at me! Walk.

26:15.820 --> 26:17.979
What happened?
You woke up one day and go home

26:17.980 --> 26:21.099
and tell your mother
you were a slave to Allah?

26:21.100 --> 26:22.940
You think I believe that?

26:22.980 --> 26:26.660
I know what you are.
I know what you did with the van!

26:29.220 --> 26:31.419
You lied to me.

26:31.420 --> 26:33.699
Get on your hands and knees!

26:33.700 --> 26:34.940
Do it!

26:39.260 --> 26:40.500
Don't look at me!

26:43.940 --> 26:45.300
Insha'Allah.

26:46.780 --> 26:48.300
Yeah?

26:48.340 --> 26:49.420
Whatever.

27:09.660 --> 27:10.860
Jack?

27:13.500 --> 27:14.540
Nikki?

27:16.500 --> 27:17.980
Thomas.

27:18.020 --> 27:19.419
I'm here.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.019
What is it?

27:21.020 --> 27:22.100
Her.

27:30.980 --> 27:33.819
It's OK, come on.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.540
It's all right.

27:35.580 --> 27:37.899
Can I get some details, please?

27:37.900 --> 27:38.900
Name?

27:40.740 --> 27:41.740
It's OK.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.419
Akka Khoury.

27:45.420 --> 27:46.979
Date of birth.

27:46.980 --> 27:49.139
September 2001.

27:49.140 --> 27:50.620
Address?

27:53.340 --> 27:57.980
Thomas Lyell House.
118 Giles Street. London, W2.

27:58.020 --> 28:00.779
Do you have a phone number?
No, she doesn't have a phone.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.220
She doesn't have a phone?

28:02.260 --> 28:04.580
Why don't we get her in
to see a doctor

28:04.620 --> 28:06.020
and then we can worry about that?

28:06.060 --> 28:08.540
How did you get your injuries?

28:08.580 --> 28:11.180
I don't think it's appropriate
for you to ask that.

28:11.220 --> 28:12.780
It's on the form here.

28:14.380 --> 28:16.260
A fall.

28:16.300 --> 28:18.100
What kind of fall?

28:18.140 --> 28:20.630
Look, she really needs to see
a doctor as soon as possible.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.740
And I'll need to contact
her parents.

28:22.780 --> 28:24.700
No, you won't.

28:24.818 --> 28:26.022
Gillick Competency.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.539
What is your relationship
with Miss Khoury?

28:29.540 --> 28:30.780
A friend.

28:30.820 --> 28:32.100
Not next of kin?

28:32.140 --> 28:33.940
No. I would have said "next of kin."

28:33.980 --> 28:35.340
I need to sit down.

28:44.860 --> 28:47.619
No. And I don't know anyone
called "Janna".

28:47.620 --> 28:50.620
I'm not on CloudHookUp.
I didn't do anything...

28:50.660 --> 28:51.820
Sit down, Miss Nasr.

28:59.340 --> 29:01.140
Is your real name Tamara Nasr?

29:01.180 --> 29:03.980
Yes. Of course. What is this about?

29:05.180 --> 29:06.860
We just need to check a few details.

29:16.020 --> 29:20.259
She's Lebanese. And her visa
expired three months ago.

29:20.260 --> 29:22.659
She doesn't have
the CloudHookUp app on her phone.

29:22.660 --> 29:23.860
Second phone?

29:25.140 --> 29:27.660
I think she was the one
to see him alive.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.620
Why wasn't she on the CCTV?

29:31.860 --> 29:33.860
I'll hold her on the overstay.

29:33.900 --> 29:36.380
We need DNA to put her
at the crime scene.

29:39.900 --> 29:41.780
Akka... Khoury?

29:45.900 --> 29:47.500
Just Akka.

29:48.700 --> 29:51.740
It will be OK.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.779
Could you tell the doctor that
she's fractured the left orbital rim

29:56.780 --> 29:58.540
and possibly the anterior
maxillary wall

29:58.580 --> 30:00.940
and the radius and ulna
are fractured in her left arm.

30:00.980 --> 30:02.660
Of course, Dr Google.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.780
Open.

30:14.940 --> 30:16.339
Thank you.

30:16.340 --> 30:18.340
Why are you doing this to me?

30:47.460 --> 30:49.220
Sorry, excuse me.

31:04.940 --> 31:06.660
Can I help you?

31:06.700 --> 31:09.460
Radiology.
Looking for Akka Khoury?

31:10.780 --> 31:11.980
Thanks.

31:18.500 --> 31:19.620
We're going.

31:21.860 --> 31:23.220
Right.

31:28.260 --> 31:29.860
Sorry.

31:35.980 --> 31:37.380
That's her.

31:37.420 --> 31:38.740
Excuse me.

31:40.220 --> 31:41.500
Excuse me!

32:06.140 --> 32:07.780
Put your arm here.

32:17.940 --> 32:21.460
Sorry. That's it.

32:39.580 --> 32:42.340
Where can you go where
you'll be safe?

32:47.660 --> 32:49.460
You weren't working that night.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.779
You weren't at The Rooftop.

32:51.780 --> 32:53.740
So what were you doing?

32:53.780 --> 32:55.540
I got a takeaway.

32:55.580 --> 32:57.820
Takeaway. From where? Catino's.

32:57.860 --> 32:59.820
You have a credit card receipt,
right?

32:59.860 --> 33:01.180
I paid in cash.

33:02.540 --> 33:04.380
You didn't buy a takeaway, did you?

33:04.420 --> 33:05.859
I didn't do anything.

33:05.860 --> 33:07.740
Why did you hide your identity?
I didn't!

33:07.780 --> 33:10.219
Why were you meeting Jamal?
I wasn't.

33:10.220 --> 33:11.620
What happened, Tamara?

33:13.460 --> 33:15.419
Let me try and help you out.

33:15.420 --> 33:17.300
Maybe you were defending yourself.

33:17.340 --> 33:20.660
Clarissa, can we get the CCTV
of a takeaway restaurant?

33:20.700 --> 33:22.260
A place called "Catino's".

33:22.300 --> 33:24.380
Did you kill Jamal al Sham?

33:24.420 --> 33:25.860
No!

33:28.900 --> 33:31.940
CCTV of the till at Catino's.

33:31.980 --> 33:34.379
She paid cash. 20:57.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.580
Time code is in
the upper right hand corner.

33:36.620 --> 33:37.980
That's her. No question about it.

33:38.020 --> 33:39.060
She wasn't there.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.860
You've made me look a right tosser.
Jamal was catfished.

33:41.900 --> 33:43.579
So were we...
Wait - "catfish"?

33:43.580 --> 33:45.100
"Janna" is a fiction.

33:45.140 --> 33:46.979
They took a photo of Tamara
they found online,

33:46.980 --> 33:49.820
created "Janna" and built up
a profile on CloudHookUp.

33:49.860 --> 33:51.940
Right, so who is "Janna"?

33:51.980 --> 33:53.460
It could be anyone.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.060
Can we find out
who built the profile?

33:55.100 --> 33:57.539
I've tried and so far nothing.

33:57.540 --> 33:59.299
Why pick Tamara Nasr?

33:59.300 --> 34:02.339
Is there some purpose in choosing
her or is it just random?

34:02.340 --> 34:04.020
Good-looking. Muslim. She was bait.

34:04.060 --> 34:05.260
Race hate?

34:05.300 --> 34:07.340
Islam isn't a race.

34:07.380 --> 34:08.780
Oh, come on, you know what I mean.

34:08.820 --> 34:10.139
Sadly, I do.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.539
I told you how much it costs.

34:14.540 --> 34:17.780
If you have the money then
we've something we can talk about...

34:17.820 --> 34:19.260
Please. I show you.

34:57.260 --> 35:00.059
Please.

35:00.060 --> 35:01.380
For you.

35:04.380 --> 35:06.660
She is infidel. You take her.

35:06.700 --> 35:08.180
For you. Take her for you.

35:10.460 --> 35:11.740
For me?

35:11.780 --> 35:14.100
Yeah. She for you.

35:14.140 --> 35:16.540
You do things to her! What you want.

35:16.580 --> 35:18.780
Sell her. Fun. Make money.

35:18.820 --> 35:20.300
Do what you want.

35:22.460 --> 35:24.220
Now what do you want?

35:24.260 --> 35:26.860
Please. Take us to England.

35:27.940 --> 35:30.780
Both. Please, take us to England.

35:32.580 --> 35:36.220
I take the girl as payment
so you two can go to England?

35:37.700 --> 35:39.060
Yes.

35:44.900 --> 35:47.180
Leve-toi! Leve-toi!

35:55.980 --> 35:57.540
I'll take her.

35:58.940 --> 36:01.020
Merci. Merci beaucoup.

36:06.740 --> 36:09.979
I'm not buying her. I'm taking her.

36:09.980 --> 36:12.020
You come near me again,
I'll kill you!

36:35.380 --> 36:36.819
Tamara?

36:36.820 --> 36:40.460
Tamara Nasr?
I'm from Immigration Enforcement.

36:41.860 --> 36:44.460
I have reason to believe
that you've overstayed your visa.

36:53.940 --> 36:55.059
She...

36:55.060 --> 36:57.660
No she's got to go, Nikki.
She, she cannot stay here.

36:57.700 --> 36:59.379
I know, I know, I know.
You're right, but I...

36:59.380 --> 37:02.140
There are no buts.
They beat her up, Thomas.

37:02.180 --> 37:04.019
Her grandfather, her brother.

37:04.020 --> 37:06.220
People she is meant to trust
beat her up.

37:06.260 --> 37:08.140
Broke her cheekbone, her arm.

37:08.180 --> 37:09.180
Go to the police.

37:09.220 --> 37:12.740
So they can detain her?
You know that's not going to happen.

37:12.780 --> 37:15.660
There is no safe place for her,
Thomas.

37:15.700 --> 37:18.419
She didn't come from one of the
refugee camps,

37:18.420 --> 37:20.020
so we won't give her asylum.

37:20.060 --> 37:21.660
Their home in Aleppo is rubble.

37:21.700 --> 37:24.779
They walked here for a better life
and she's lying there,

37:24.780 --> 37:26.260
15 years old and battered!

37:26.300 --> 37:29.059
You change who you are for
a better life, not where you are.

37:29.060 --> 37:33.802
I'm guessing that's going to sound like bullshit
to anyone who's had to flee their own country.

37:40.980 --> 37:43.420
You live in the shadows.

37:43.460 --> 37:45.540
Always looking over your shoulder.

37:45.580 --> 37:47.660
And you still think
it's a better life.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.500
What do I do?

37:54.380 --> 37:56.620
Let her sleep.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.780
You're Christian?

38:11.660 --> 38:13.220
From Aleppo?

38:29.140 --> 38:30.500
Why are you alone?

38:32.100 --> 38:35.820
We were waiting for the boat.

38:37.660 --> 38:41.700
People were pushing and shoving.

38:43.740 --> 38:47.380
I... I fell down.
No-one helped me up.

38:49.060 --> 38:52.860
They just kept walking on me,
pushing me down.

38:54.940 --> 38:56.940
When I got to the edge
of the water...

38:59.020 --> 39:01.459
..there was no room left.

39:01.460 --> 39:03.860
I could see my mother.

39:06.020 --> 39:07.980
I shouted to her...

39:09.340 --> 39:10.740
She didn't look back.

39:13.020 --> 39:14.420
Maybe she didn't hear you.

39:16.060 --> 39:17.260
Maybe.

39:23.260 --> 39:25.940
Maybe she's dead.

39:25.980 --> 39:28.020
I have family in England.

39:29.500 --> 39:30.779
Here.

39:30.780 --> 39:33.580
At this address, in my coat.

39:33.620 --> 39:34.939
How old are you?

39:34.940 --> 39:36.460
12.

39:49.460 --> 39:50.740
Get in.

39:51.820 --> 39:53.419
Get in!

39:53.420 --> 39:56.460
No. Wait, wait, wait.

40:04.460 --> 40:08.060
Wear this. You'll be safer.

40:14.060 --> 40:16.580
Get in. Get some sleep.

40:31.820 --> 40:34.820
My friend. No.

40:34.860 --> 40:37.020
Please. No, no. Please.

41:28.060 --> 41:29.419
Where are we?

41:29.420 --> 41:30.420
Be quiet.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.820
Stay here.

42:06.780 --> 42:08.260
I told you to stay in the car.

42:17.860 --> 42:19.220
Stop it.

42:20.900 --> 42:22.059
Quickly.

42:22.060 --> 42:23.380
Vite! Bisur'a!

42:25.180 --> 42:26.740
Get in the van.

42:45.260 --> 42:46.860
England?

42:46.900 --> 42:48.420
Insha'Allah.

42:48.460 --> 42:50.900
Come on.

43:57.580 --> 43:59.700
Good morning.

43:59.740 --> 44:01.580
Yeah.

44:01.620 --> 44:03.820
I didn't want to wake her.

44:03.860 --> 44:06.099
Yeah. She's got to go, Nikki.

44:06.100 --> 44:08.659
She cannot become our problem.

44:08.660 --> 44:10.019
She is our problem.

44:10.020 --> 44:12.140
Look! Quick! Your heart's bleeding.

44:16.260 --> 44:18.580
Hello.

44:18.620 --> 44:21.220
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be right there.

44:21.260 --> 44:23.379
Are you expecting DCI Goodchild?

44:23.380 --> 44:24.780
No.

44:34.580 --> 44:35.780
Akka?

44:39.260 --> 44:41.179
Thank you.

44:41.180 --> 44:43.260
You're welcome.

44:43.300 --> 44:46.740
Listen, we need to talk about
what you're going to do

44:46.780 --> 44:48.980
and where you're going to go.

44:56.700 --> 44:58.900
Good morning.
Dr Chamberlain.

44:58.940 --> 45:00.139
How can I help you?

45:00.140 --> 45:01.300
This is a funny one...

45:01.340 --> 45:04.060
Good, the world's always
short of a laugh.

45:04.100 --> 45:06.900
Two uniformed officers attended
Alderman hospital last night.

45:06.940 --> 45:09.739
There were fears that a young girl
who had been brought into A&E

45:09.740 --> 45:11.779
with injuries consistent
with an assault

45:11.780 --> 45:13.700
might be the victim
of human trafficking.

45:13.740 --> 45:15.260
Yes, well, that's very funny so far.

45:15.300 --> 45:17.580
The girl looks like she might be
Akka Khoury,

45:17.620 --> 45:19.380
and she was brought there by a woman

45:19.420 --> 45:22.219
who looked remarkably like
Dr Alexander on the CCTV.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.859
Unfortunately, she left before
the police could speak to her.

45:24.860 --> 45:27.100
Curious, don't you think?

45:27.140 --> 45:28.340
Mm-hm.

45:28.380 --> 45:29.700
Still not a barrel of laughs.

45:29.740 --> 45:31.660
She left this as her home address.

45:33.700 --> 45:36.900
Let me talk to Dr Alexander, see if
she knows anything about this.

45:36.940 --> 45:38.779
Why don't we come with you?

45:38.780 --> 45:40.740
Why don't you wait here?

45:56.260 --> 45:58.620
Goodchild and Butler are here
looking for Akka.

45:58.660 --> 45:59.699
How did they...?

45:59.700 --> 46:01.860
You gave this as her home address.

46:01.900 --> 46:04.300
Nikki, I am not happy.

46:05.500 --> 46:06.940
No.

46:08.500 --> 46:10.420
Do you know where Akka is?

46:14.700 --> 46:16.700
No. I'm not sure that I do.

46:16.740 --> 46:18.820
Has she left the Lyell Centre?

46:19.860 --> 46:21.180
Possibly.

46:21.220 --> 46:22.980
Right. They'd like to speak to you.

46:23.020 --> 46:24.659
Shall we all chat
in the meeting room?

46:24.660 --> 46:26.460
Good idea.

46:34.820 --> 46:38.220
This is my phone number.
Let me know that you're safe.

46:40.900 --> 46:43.660
OK, this is what's going to happen.

46:50.700 --> 46:52.340
Good morning.

46:52.380 --> 46:54.899
Yeah, well, it's nice to be hopeful.

46:54.900 --> 46:56.300
Please, sit down.

46:59.180 --> 47:01.780
Now then. Coffee.

47:30.380 --> 47:33.580
Were you at the hospital with Akka?
Yes.

47:33.620 --> 47:35.100
Where is she?
I don't know.

47:35.140 --> 47:36.740
Are you playing games with me?

47:36.780 --> 47:38.380
Playing games?

47:38.420 --> 47:41.939
You mean like using me as bait to
arrest a group of desperate people?

47:41.940 --> 47:43.220
They broke the law.

47:43.260 --> 47:44.820
Illegal immigration.

47:44.860 --> 47:48.339
Assault, mutilation, extortion,
those are serious matters.

47:48.340 --> 47:50.340
You think a 15-year-old girl
is responsible?

47:50.380 --> 47:53.539
No, we think a 15-year-old girl
is in danger.

47:53.540 --> 47:55.780
I'm afraid she thinks
you're the danger.

47:55.820 --> 47:58.060
Perhaps you could convince her
otherwise?

47:58.100 --> 47:59.699
It would be irresponsible not to.

47:59.700 --> 48:00.900
She's afraid.

48:00.940 --> 48:02.219
Afraid of what?

48:02.220 --> 48:04.740
Losing the little she's got left.

48:04.780 --> 48:07.580
Overcrowded detention centres
riddled with disease,

48:07.620 --> 48:09.260
being deported with her family...

48:09.300 --> 48:11.780
She should be afraid of extortion
and being exploited.

48:11.820 --> 48:14.300
Oh, yeah. How's that going for you?

48:14.340 --> 48:16.940
I'm back. Everything sorted?

48:16.980 --> 48:18.579
Where is she, Dr Alexander?

48:18.580 --> 48:20.340
I've told you, I don't know.

48:31.300 --> 48:33.940
If you hear from her,
I suggest you let us know.

48:33.980 --> 48:36.380
I wouldn't want to think
you were obstructing justice.

48:36.420 --> 48:38.380
I'm confident I'm not doing that.

49:01.740 --> 49:03.060
An app?

49:03.100 --> 49:05.099
I don't think so.

49:05.100 --> 49:08.020
Letter. Three numbers.
Letter. Two numbers.

49:08.060 --> 49:09.739
Seven character password.

49:09.740 --> 49:12.780
Most passwords are
between six and nine characters.

49:12.820 --> 49:15.620
OK. That narrows it down. Erm...

49:15.660 --> 49:17.980
What apps did he have on his phone?

49:18.020 --> 49:21.100
CloudHookUp.
MemoWire messenger app.

49:21.140 --> 49:22.979
Maps for Europe.

49:22.980 --> 49:25.180
That all?
That should be easy to check.

49:25.220 --> 49:26.620
It's going to be a website.

49:26.660 --> 49:27.939
You're sure?

49:27.940 --> 49:30.299
Yeah 100%. Well, 99.

49:32.300 --> 49:35.540
Hello. Yep.

49:35.580 --> 49:36.980
Er, address?

49:39.260 --> 49:42.660
OK. On my way. Nikki?

49:42.700 --> 49:45.179
Just got it. Ready?

49:45.180 --> 49:46.180
Nikki?

49:48.340 --> 49:49.660
Password for a website.

49:49.700 --> 49:53.099
A website? Wow. Good thinking.

49:53.100 --> 49:55.820
Thanks. You're welcome.

50:05.260 --> 50:06.820
I think he was struck out there.

50:08.300 --> 50:10.179
Latex gloves. Robbery gone wrong?

50:10.180 --> 50:11.300
Could be.

50:11.340 --> 50:13.740
Low-level droplets suggest
he crawled to the position

50:13.780 --> 50:14.979
where the body was found.

50:14.980 --> 50:16.139
Mm-hm.

50:16.140 --> 50:17.379
Murder weapon?

50:17.380 --> 50:20.459
No obvious wood splinter.
Metal? A metal bar?

50:20.460 --> 50:22.699
A bar would do it. Blood on it?

50:22.700 --> 50:23.980
Almost certainly.

50:30.980 --> 50:32.499
Cast-offs?

50:32.500 --> 50:34.420
Yeah. Yeah.

50:45.100 --> 50:47.260
I think he threw it in one
of these skips.

50:49.220 --> 50:50.220
I'm going in.

50:52.780 --> 50:54.180
Blunt force injury.

50:54.220 --> 50:56.820
Crushed the external
occipital crest.

50:56.860 --> 50:59.020
Didn't die instantly.

50:59.060 --> 51:02.380
Brain possibly haemorrhaged
from the blow.

51:17.500 --> 51:20.980
The first officers on the scene
pulled his wallet to try and ID him.

51:21.020 --> 51:22.820
We think he's called Kali Aziz.

51:25.500 --> 51:27.260
Renick?

51:27.300 --> 51:28.940
You're going to want to see this.

51:38.260 --> 51:39.660
So it's a password?

51:39.700 --> 51:41.060
One of the last messages he sent.

51:41.100 --> 51:43.940
He sent to an unknown recipient,
but from the time stamp,

51:43.980 --> 51:45.740
it's likely to be Jamal al Sham.

51:45.780 --> 51:49.220
Did they knew each other?
They're both dead.

51:49.260 --> 51:50.859
What were they involved in?

51:50.860 --> 51:53.579
Well, do we know what it's
a password for? Not yet.

51:53.580 --> 51:57.740
Is that the password? For a website?

51:57.780 --> 51:59.580
You think?

51:59.620 --> 52:02.020
That's funny.
I didn't see that at all.

52:02.060 --> 52:04.419
I have a friend who lives
south of Tunbridge Wells,

52:04.420 --> 52:07.300
just off the A267.

52:09.700 --> 52:12.260
"B" means "Back to London".
94km to Charing Cross.

52:12.300 --> 52:15.940
It's kilometres, not miles,
cos of the EU or something.

52:15.980 --> 52:18.500
It's not a password, it's a place.

52:24.620 --> 52:28.060
There's nothing. Why are we here?!

52:42.180 --> 52:44.700
Yes. It's Renick. There's nothing.

52:44.740 --> 52:47.340
Nothing. Well, we're down here.

52:47.380 --> 52:49.540
There's no car. Jack?

52:49.580 --> 52:54.620
Nothing down here.
Double check the marker again...

52:57.500 --> 53:02.500
Do you see them? Buzzards.

53:02.540 --> 53:06.820
They can smell the ethyl mercaptan
emitted when an animal has died.

53:06.860 --> 53:08.860
They smell death.

53:14.860 --> 53:16.780
Renick?

53:34.860 --> 53:37.300
Over here!

54:04.500 --> 54:06.460
Dents.

54:22.220 --> 54:24.220
Have you touched anything?

54:27.060 --> 54:28.260
Jack?

55:01.420 --> 55:03.020
God forgive us all.

55:07.500 --> 55:09.100
Where's my brother?

55:09.140 --> 55:10.899
I have no more money.

55:10.900 --> 55:12.940
Please. Where is he? Please!

55:12.980 --> 55:15.500
May we take a look in the back,
please? Sure.

55:15.540 --> 55:16.900
Nehwe sebyonokh...

55:18.460 --> 55:21.300
My mother, she's alive!

55:21.340 --> 55:23.820
Liar!
No. She's not a liar.

55:23.860 --> 55:25.740
Are they safe, Abdul? Are they safe?

55:25.780 --> 55:27.460
I'm going to have him.
