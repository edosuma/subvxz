00:26.527 --> 00:29.029
They came to... my house.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.538
They had a fight.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.053
They couldn't find
what they were looking for.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.108
Sheriff?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.611
Who, uh... who called it in?

01:50.652 --> 01:51.612
Anonymous 911.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.571
Listen,

01:52.613 --> 01:54.615
we haven't had a murder
in all of Lincoln County

01:54.656 --> 01:56.575
in ten years,
let alone a quadruple.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.619
Without the bodies, I can't
confirm there was a murder.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.579
No offense, Mr. Stokes, but

02:00.621 --> 02:02.623
did you see the amount
of blood in that house

02:02.664 --> 02:04.082
Somebody's dead.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.084
What do you know
about the family?

02:06.126 --> 02:08.628
Jude McBride- great guy,
stay-at-home dad.

02:08.669 --> 02:10.589
Nina owns a local coffee shop.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.633
Jeremy's a junior
in high school, smart kid.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.635
Ten-year-old daughter, Cassie.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.094
Pip-squeak.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.639
Sounds like all that's missi
is the white picket fence, huh?

02:18.680 --> 02:20.140
Yeah.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.645
We don't even know
where to start looking.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.647
Begin at the beginning.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.617
? Who... are you??

02:38.659 --> 02:41.161
? Who, who, who, who??

02:41.662 --> 02:44.623
? Who... are you??

02:44.665 --> 02:46.416
? Who, who, who, who??

02:46.458 --> 02:48.585
? I really wanna know?

02:48.627 --> 02:50.629
? Who... are you??

02:50.671 --> 02:52.673
? Oh...?
? Who...?

02:53.173 --> 02:56.176
? Come on, tell me who are you,
you, you?

02:56.218 --> 02:59.179
? Oh, you!?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.689
I loved my family.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.741
Are we having
a Taster's Choice moment?

04:01.241 --> 04:02.701
Grissom called me
from the airport.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.245
He's teaching a Human Remains
Recovery class

04:05.287 --> 04:06.246
at the body farm.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.249
He said you needed backup,
and I figure you needed coffee,

04:09.291 --> 04:11.251
but... looks like
you already took care of it.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.712
Oh, no.
No, I didn't do it.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.756
Coffeemaker's programme
to go on Monday through Friday.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.257
So, somebody cleaned up
Friday's coffee

04:18.300 --> 04:20.260
and reset it to go off today?

04:20.761 --> 04:21.762
You'd have to be alive
to do that.

04:21.803 --> 04:22.721
Which means

04:22.763 --> 04:24.765
whatever happened here
happened over the weekend.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.725
Blood pools are dry, so,

04:26.767 --> 04:29.728
crime scene's
at least 12 hours old.

04:29.770 --> 04:33.273
There were at least
three major blood events:

04:33.315 --> 04:38.278
here... here...
and up the stairs.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.280
Without the bodies, we'll
have to confirm the source

04:40.322 --> 04:42.282
of the blood through
DNA comparison.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.785
I'll collect toothbrushes,
hairbrushes...

04:44.826 --> 04:47.746
You know, it's possible

04:47.788 --> 04:49.289
it wasn't the family
that died here.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.749
The sheriff confirmed

04:50.791 --> 04:52.292
the McBrides' cars
are parked out front,

04:52.793 --> 04:54.044
and their cell phones,
car keys,

04:54.086 --> 04:55.170
wallets are
all right there.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.296
Can't get far without thos e.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.756
Mm.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.800
It would also seem to
eliminate robbery as a motive.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.301
Yeah.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.266
What a mess.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.809
If you're not gonna
clean it up...

05:08.851 --> 05:11.311
why take the bodies?

05:11.353 --> 05:12.771
Yeah.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.065
Well, I'm go
nna start upstairs

05:15.107 --> 05:17.317
I'll take outside.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.839
Based on their shoes,

06:20.881 --> 06:24.343
Dad wore a 9-1/2,
Mom wore a 9.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.887
Jeremy wore an 8-1/2,
and Cassie wore a 1.

06:28.388 --> 06:32.351
between blood pool #1
and blood pool #2.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.395
And the barefoot print
on the stairs looks smaller.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.899
Yeah, they're consistent
with the mom, size 9.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.901
No matches to Jeremy
or Cassie, though.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.403
Let's just assume
they were shot.

06:43.445 --> 06:46.365
Maybe they were
shot first.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.408
There's no blood to step in
if you're first.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.164
Or Mom could have grabbed
Cassie up,

06:54.206 --> 06:56.416
try to take her away
from it all.

06:56.917 --> 06:57.417
Bullet penetrated both bodies.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.922
Could explain why there are only
three blood pools.

07:01.964 --> 07:04.424
There are three other sets
of shoeprints.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.885
One size 12,
two size 11.

07:06.927 --> 07:11.431
Two of the sets appear
to be going back and forth

07:11.473 --> 07:13.433
from the kitchen area
to the front door.

07:13.475 --> 07:14.893
One set, and only one set,

07:14.935 --> 07:16.895
headed upstairs
for the bedrooms.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.939
I'll go up there
and see what I can find.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.974
Sheriff Brackett...

07:54.474 --> 07:57.477
did your deputies drive anything
up here with a hitch?

07:57.519 --> 07:59.938
No. Why?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.982
I got an odd-siz
ed tread here.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.052
I hate the taste of that stuff.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.075
I like Nancy Drew.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.577
She always gets the bad guy.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.602
I knew all my lines
and Hansel's, too.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.592
What is that?

10:33.634 --> 10:36.637
If it's labeled correctly,
it's, uh, Cassie's laugh.

11:22.683 --> 11:25.185
My man Jeremy's a bit
of an entrepreneur here.

11:25.227 --> 11:26.645
Oh, yeah? How's that?

11:26.687 --> 11:28.647
He's trafficking in term papers.

11:28.689 --> 11:31.692
Whatever happened
to just flipping burgers, man?

11:54.715 --> 11:57.217
I think I figured out
when all this happened.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.177
Cassie never got

11:58.218 --> 12:00.179
to her Saturday
morning chores.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.724
I was really into gold stars
when I was a kid.

12:03.765 --> 12:07.728
As opposed to now?

12:20.741 --> 12:21.700
Whoa!

12:21.742 --> 12:24.203
The McBrides must
have a broken meter.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.247
Even if they left every
light on day and night,

12:27.289 --> 12:28.707
it wouldn't add up to $2,000

12:28.749 --> 12:31.710
Maybe Brass ca n check it out.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.254
I think this print dust
is getting to me.

12:34.296 --> 12:37.257
Would you mind
finishing the fridge?

12:37.299 --> 12:39.009
Do I get a gold star?

12:39.051 --> 12:40.761
Ha-ha-ha.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.305
Greg?

13:25.806 --> 13:27.307
I found something.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.812
Is it the bodies?

13:31.854 --> 13:34.773
No.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.817
Whoa.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.323
Sweet Mary Jane.

13:43.365 --> 13:46.285
The Emerald City.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.787
Explains the $2,000
electric bill.

13:48.829 --> 13:51.832
And all the footprin
ts throughout the house

13:51.874 --> 13:54.835
It's a ganja graveyard.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.295
No...

13:56.336 --> 13:58.338
it's motive.

14:05.804 --> 14:09.308
Whew..

14:09.308 --> 14:11.310
Looks like someone shot
out the lock upstairs.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.312
I found what looked
like fragments

14:13.812 --> 14:15.314
of two bullets; they
may be too M-and-D

14:15.814 --> 14:16.815
for a comparison,

14:16.815 --> 14:18.317
but I could probably
get type and caliber.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.319
Man.

14:20.319 --> 14:23.822
If those suspects
got everything on those lines,

14:23.864 --> 14:26.325
they made out like fat cats.

14:26.325 --> 14:28.827
Yeah, but they were only
interested in the dried stuff.

14:28.869 --> 14:31.330
If this was a territory war,
or something like that,

14:31.830 --> 14:33.332
wouldn't the dealer
want to take the new growth,

14:33.373 --> 14:35.125
to try to put these guys
out of business?

14:35.167 --> 14:36.752
Maybe one of the customers
got greedy.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.337
Well, we're talking about

14:38.337 --> 14:40.339
getting rich, not
getting high, you know

14:40.339 --> 14:43.342
And these dry ones go
a lot faster than those.

14:43.342 --> 14:45.844
The price of an ounce these days
is anywhere from $200 to $400.

14:45.886 --> 14:48.347
Don't you guys think it's we
irthat the McBrides did all this

14:48.388 --> 14:50.349
with two kids in the house?

14:50.849 --> 14:52.351
Yeah, if they
didn't care before,

14:52.851 --> 14:54.353
I bet they do now.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.868
Well, we took some
representative samples

15:09.910 --> 15:11.870
of the green
plant material

15:11.870 --> 15:13.872
Okay, Ecklie's
sending out a tech.

15:13.872 --> 15:15.374
I'll include it
with the other evidence.

15:15.374 --> 15:16.875
st Pioche P.D.'s goin
g to hold on to the re

15:16.917 --> 15:18.919
until we can secure
it for bulk transport.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.879
How's it going w
ith the phone records?

15:20.879 --> 15:24.383
No outgoing calls from the house
after 6:00 p. m. Friday night.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.385
I scrolled through
Jude McBride's

15:26.885 --> 15:27.886
recent cell phone calls.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.888
No activity all weekend
until Sunday night.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.682
Several incoming calls,

15:31.723 --> 15:33.392
all from the same number.

15:33.892 --> 15:36.395
According to Pioche P.D.
dispatch, it's the same number

15:36.436 --> 15:38.397
as the anonymous 911 call.

15:38.397 --> 15:41.149
So I had the phone company
cross-check it,

15:41.191 --> 15:43.902
the guy's local:
Dr. Malcolm Parker.

15:43.944 --> 15:46.405
I'll go check itout.

15:52.411 --> 15:54.413
Be careful with
those stitches, okay?

15:54.454 --> 15:55.956
I just put them in a couple days ago.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.416
Your mom will
kill me if it scars.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.419
Okay.

16:00.419 --> 16:01.920
Sorry about that, guys.
You had some questions?

16:02.421 --> 16:04.673
You placed an anonymous
911 call Sunday night.

16:04.715 --> 16:06.842
Said you were outside
the McBrides' house

16:06.884 --> 16:08.927
and you could see
blood in the entryway.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.429
Right before that,

16:10.429 --> 16:13.432
you called Jude McBride's
cell phone three times.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.933
Late night house call...?

16:15.434 --> 16:17.436
Dennis, do I have
to answer that?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.438
It looks worse if you don't.

16:19.438 --> 16:23.942
Well, Jude and I have a standing
Sunday night appointment.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.444
For what?

16:26.945 --> 16:28.947
You are aware that it's illegal.

16:29.448 --> 16:33.452
Okay, look, I have no idea
what went on out there,

16:33.494 --> 16:34.995
before I got there.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.246
Hi, Jude, it's 8:00.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.456
Where are you guys?

16:37.498 --> 16:39.958
I called 911.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.461
I didn't leave my name,
because...

16:42.461 --> 16:44.463
because I didn't want to explain
what I was doing there.

16:44.505 --> 16:45.964
You and Jude are making me
look like an idiot.

16:46.465 --> 16:47.716
He's selling drugs,

16:47.758 --> 16:49.134
and you're buying them.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.469
Tell me something, Malcolm.

16:50.469 --> 16:52.471
Are you high when you
treat my daughter?

16:52.513 --> 16:54.014
Dennis, of course not.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.474
And Jude was discreet.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.726
He rarely sold
to anybody in town.

16:57.768 --> 16:59.978
He sent most of it out of state.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.482
Dr. Parker, what size shoes
do you wear?

17:03.524 --> 17:05.275
What size shoe do I wear?
A10.

17:05.317 --> 17:06.984
And where were you Friday night?

17:07.027 --> 17:08.487
I was here, doing rounds.

17:13.492 --> 17:15.493
Hello, there.

17:15.536 --> 17:16.494
Hi.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.997
Can I help you?

17:19.039 --> 17:20.999
I'm Sage.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.501
I'm looking for Nina.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.502
Yeah? So am I.

17:24.502 --> 17:28.507
She left work early Friday
to see Jimmy Buffet in Tahoe.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.009
But then she never showed up
at the shop today.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.010
And what was your name again?

17:32.511 --> 17:33.512
Sage.
Sage.

17:33.512 --> 17:36.014
Okay, yeah, maybe you
can help me out.

17:36.014 --> 17:38.016
Um, the family,
what do you know about them?

17:38.058 --> 17:39.017
Were they having problems?

17:39.017 --> 17:41.520
Marital problems,
anything like that?

17:41.562 --> 17:42.521
Are you kidding?

17:42.521 --> 17:45.524
Nina and Jude had the
marriage we all wanted.

17:45.566 --> 17:46.525
Really?

17:48.026 --> 17:49.528
You know, uh,

17:49.570 --> 17:51.029
your third eye

17:51.029 --> 17:54.533
is so open right now.

17:54.533 --> 17:57.035
Are you having visions
or hearing voices?

17:57.536 --> 17:59.037
No.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.039
I'm really sorry

18:01.039 --> 18:03.041
But you're radiating

18:03.041 --> 18:05.544
this crazy feminine energy

18:05.544 --> 18:08.046
Really.
Mm-hmm

18:08.046 --> 18:09.047
Do you believe in past lives?

18:09.548 --> 18:13.051
No, ma'am. How come?

18:13.051 --> 18:16.555
Because I'm just trying
to make it through this one.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.560
I think you're doing
pretty well.

18:32.571 --> 18:34.072
Hey... Sage.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.075
Thanks.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.082
Hey, Nick.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.584
Well, there's no hits
off the fingerprints

18:45.626 --> 18:47.085
from the kitchen cabinets.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.588
Dozens of unknowns, none
of which were in the system-

18:49.630 --> 18:51.590
no work cards, no prior crime.

18:51.590 --> 18:54.593
So I expanded the search
to other databases,

18:54.635 --> 18:57.095
and I did get one hit.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.598
A Mark Horvatin.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.601
17 years old, Junior ROTC.

19:02.601 --> 19:04.102
His print was in the kitchen,
but not in blood.

19:04.603 --> 19:05.604
Could just be a friend.

19:07.606 --> 19:09.608
That was nice, dude.

19:09.608 --> 19:11.109
That was nice.
You got smoked.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.110
Hey, Mark!

19:12.152 --> 19:15.113
Mark!

19:15.113 --> 19:17.115
Hey, I'll catch up
with you guys later.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.617
Later, man Later.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.620
Nice game Saturday

19:21.662 --> 19:23.121
Hey, Dennis.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.623
Listen, we should probably
go with Sheriff Brackett

19:25.123 --> 19:26.124
on this one.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.126
Oh, okay, Sheriff.

19:28.126 --> 19:32.631
This is Mr. Stokes
from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.635
What size shoe
do you wear?

19:37.135 --> 19:38.136
Twelve.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.138
Can I see the bottom?

19:40.180 --> 19:42.140
Should I get my dad?

19:42.140 --> 19:44.643
No, we're just talking.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.648
Oh, yeah,

19:50.148 --> 19:51.149
they're new, huh?

19:51.149 --> 19:52.651
Yeah, I got them this weekend.

19:52.651 --> 19:55.153
My old ones were thrashed. STOKES : Huh.

19:56.655 --> 19:59.157
You know, when I played ball,

19:59.157 --> 20:01.160
I used to stick all
my gear in the trunk.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.661
Yeah, well, this is just easier.

20:02.661 --> 20:05.664
Parking lot st ill school property?

20:06.165 --> 20:08.167
Yep.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.170
Why don't you go ahead
and pop the trunk for me?

20:12.171 --> 20:13.672
Go ahead.

20:31.690 --> 20:34.193
Daddy's garden was
suppose d to be a secret.

20:34.234 --> 20:37.196
Someone must have told
the secret.

20:39.198 --> 20:41.700
This isn't
looking good, Mark.

20:41.700 --> 20:44.203
Not a lot of places
you can get that much marijuana.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.205
There's no way
it could be a coincidence.

20:46.246 --> 20:49.708
Tell me where the bodies are.

21:02.721 --> 21:05.724
I'm not finding any blood
in here.

21:05.724 --> 21:09.478
Besides, four bodies would
never fit inside this car.

21:09.520 --> 21:13.232
You know, maybe, the
pot was stolen after the fact.

21:13.732 --> 21:15.734
Crime of opportunity?

21:15.776 --> 21:17.736
What are you, his lawyer?

21:18.237 --> 21:19.238
Whoever stole the pot...

21:20.739 --> 21:22.741
...had a gun
and shot the lock

21:22.783 --> 21:24.743
off the basement door.

21:24.743 --> 21:29.248
Someone went to the ATM
at 10:03 Friday night.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.291
Right in the window
of the murders.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.252
Hand that over
to Sheriff Brackett.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.754
He can run the account number.

21:49.268 --> 21:52.771
I found this exact
kind of gum

21:52.771 --> 21:55.774
in the driveway at the McBrides'.

21:58.277 --> 22:02.281
This microscope I got from
the high school is a joke.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.282
How am I ever going to prove

22:03.782 --> 22:04.783
that this is the pot
from the house?

22:06.285 --> 22:08.287
Where's that evidence
we collected?

22:22.801 --> 22:25.304
All right, this is the bag

22:25.345 --> 22:27.306
from the house.

22:28.307 --> 22:30.809
And this is the bag

22:30.851 --> 22:33.812
from the car.

22:35.314 --> 22:37.816
The striations line up.

22:38.317 --> 22:39.818
These bags
are from the same roll.

22:39.860 --> 22:40.819
Nicely done.

22:40.819 --> 22:41.820
Fellas

22:41.820 --> 22:44.823
We have a little problem.

22:44.823 --> 22:47.326
Mark's not talking,
not even to pass the buck.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.828
And his dad, Mark Sr.,
is a lawyer,

22:50.329 --> 22:52.581
and he's challenging
our search and seizure,

22:52.623 --> 22:55.250
saying that even though
we were on school grounds,

22:55.292 --> 22:57.836
we lacked probable cause
to search personal property.

23:14.853 --> 23:18.357
Blood pool closest
to the front door,

23:18.857 --> 23:22.361
and the size 9-1/2 shoe print...

23:22.361 --> 23:25.364
both in Jeremy's blood.

23:28.367 --> 23:30.828
Jeremy, what's going on?

23:30.869 --> 23:33.372
Jude stepped in Jeremy's blood

23:34.373 --> 23:36.375
Blood pool number two.

23:36.375 --> 23:37.334
In the hallway,

23:37.376 --> 23:39.878
between the foyer
and the kitchen.

23:43.382 --> 23:45.884
Nina's footprints,
dual contribution,

23:45.926 --> 23:47.886
Jeremy and Jude.

23:52.391 --> 23:55.394
Jude? Jeremy?
Is everything okay?

23:56.895 --> 24:00.399
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Jeremy!

24:06.405 --> 24:08.407
Blood pool number three...

24:10.909 --> 24:11.910
...Nina's blood.

24:28.927 --> 24:31.930
Yeah, Nick,
I got the DNA results back.

24:32.431 --> 24:36.435
Blood pools were confirmed
for Mom, Dad and Jeremy.

24:36.435 --> 24:37.936
None of the blood was Cassie's,

24:38.437 --> 24:41.440
so either her death
was a bloodless crime...

24:41.440 --> 24:43.192
Or they took her alive

24:43.233 --> 24:44.902
Thanks, Catherine.

24:44.943 --> 24:46.904
How did Mark know
where the pot was,

24:46.945 --> 24:50.949
if McBride was as discreet
as Dr. Parker claims?

24:50.949 --> 24:54.953
DNA confirmed
to everyone but Cassie.

24:54.953 --> 24:55.954
Interesting.

24:55.954 --> 24:56.914
Mm-hmm.

24:56.955 --> 24:58.457
ere Mark knew the pot was th

24:58.457 --> 24:59.416
because of Jeremy.

24:59.458 --> 25:01.960
Come on, I'm sure
Jeremy wasn't voted

25:01.960 --> 25:02.961
the most popular
boy in school.

25:03.462 --> 25:04.463
He's done everyone's
term paper.

25:04.463 --> 25:05.422
He's a nerd.

25:05.464 --> 25:07.966
So you guys want
to come over and hang out?

25:07.966 --> 25:10.427
I could sell you some pot.

25:10.469 --> 25:12.971
Now, where are you
gonna score fresh herb

25:12.971 --> 25:15.474
My parents are
going out of town.

25:15.474 --> 25:16.475
My dad has pounds of it.

25:16.975 --> 25:18.977
Yeah, so how does that end up
a quadruple murder?

25:18.977 --> 25:20.979
One of them was stupid enough
to bring a gun.

25:20.979 --> 25:22.481
I was talking to Tina
the other night.

25:22.981 --> 25:23.982
She said somethi
ng to make me think

25:23.982 --> 25:25.484
Yoko Ono.

25:28.987 --> 25:31.448
Tina's dad is
a Doctor of Anthropology,

25:31.490 --> 25:33.992
so, one day, when she was
a little girl, she asked her dad

25:34.493 --> 25:36.745
where on her body
her anthropology was.

25:36.745 --> 25:38.997
'Cause, you know,
he's a doctor.

25:38.997 --> 25:41.959
Mark's dad's a lawyer.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.001
Maybe Mark was thinking
habeas corpus-

25:43.502 --> 25:44.503
"body of the crime"?

25:45.003 --> 25:47.506
"Body of the crime" is content
of the case, not an actual body.

25:47.506 --> 25:49.258
Yeah, but a kid could
easily misinterpret.

25:49.299 --> 25:51.009
Maybe he's thinking,
"no body, no crime,

25:51.009 --> 25:52.511
no crime, no punishment."

25:52.553 --> 25:54.012
Does Yoko Ono want a job?

25:56.515 --> 25:57.516
Morning.

25:57.516 --> 25:58.475
Morning.
Hello.

25:58.517 --> 26:00.018
My wife made muffins.

26:00.018 --> 26:00.978
Thank you.

26:01.019 --> 26:01.979
You're welcome.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.981
We got a lead on the ATM.

26:04.022 --> 26:05.482
The account belongs
to Jim Locke.

26:05.524 --> 26:08.026
He's got a son named Peter,
the same age as Mark.

26:08.026 --> 26:10.529
We pulled some
surveillance footage.

26:11.029 --> 26:12.531
It's a little grainy,
can't see much.

26:13.031 --> 26:13.991
I'll give it over to Archie

26:14.032 --> 26:15.784
and see if he can clean it up.
Thanks.

26:15.784 --> 26:17.536
All right, I'll be in the car waiting

26:17.536 --> 26:18.537
when you guys are ready.

26:18.579 --> 26:19.496
All righ t, thank you.

26:19.538 --> 26:21.039
You feeling a little
homesick there?

26:21.039 --> 26:22.040
You want to draw straws?

26:24.042 --> 26:26.003
No.

26:26.044 --> 26:28.046
Call me if you need me

26:28.046 --> 26:30.007
All right.

26:30.048 --> 26:32.050
All right, let's head over
to the Lockes' house,

26:32.551 --> 26:33.552
and see what we can find.

26:39.057 --> 26:39.558
You coming

26:40.058 --> 26:41.560
No... No, you go ahead,

26:41.560 --> 26:43.520
I'll catch up.

26:43.562 --> 26:44.563
You think she's alive.

26:45.564 --> 26:47.065
You don't?

26:48.567 --> 26:50.569
None of her blood
was found at the house.

26:50.569 --> 26:55.032
I think she was drugged, and...

26:55.073 --> 26:58.076
she was lucky
if all they did after that

26:58.076 --> 26:59.536
was kill her.

26:59.578 --> 27:01.079
I don't think she was drugged.

27:01.079 --> 27:02.539
She's a smart little girl.

27:02.581 --> 27:04.541
She hid that cough medicine
in her shoe;

27:04.583 --> 27:07.586
that's like hiding green beans
in your napkin, you know?

27:07.586 --> 27:09.046
I hope you're right.

27:09.087 --> 27:12.090
Buteverythingin our experience
tells us they're dead,

27:12.090 --> 27:13.050
all four of them.

27:13.091 --> 27:14.593
Doesn't mean we just give up

27:15.093 --> 27:16.845
No one's giving up.

27:16.845 --> 27:18.597
It's just that...

27:19.097 --> 27:20.599
n, you're acting like
you're going to rescue a perso

27:20.599 --> 27:22.851
not recover a body

27:22.893 --> 27:25.062
And on this job.

27:25.103 --> 27:27.105
that's just not
usually the case.

27:30.609 --> 27:31.610
I was rescued.

27:33.612 --> 27:36.073
It was not your day to die.

27:36.114 --> 27:39.618
When it's your day,
it's your day, you know?

27:41.620 --> 27:43.622
I don't think
it was Cassie's day.

27:53.632 --> 27:55.634
That looks like
the plant material

27:55.634 --> 27:57.386
I found in
the McBrides' driveway.

27:57.427 --> 27:59.137
And this looks like
the same wheelbase

27:59.638 --> 28:00.639
as the tread you found.

28:02.140 --> 28:04.142
We found
something in Mark's car

28:04.142 --> 28:06.144
that wet hink might be Peter's.

28:06.186 --> 28:08.146
Is that your
account number

28:08.146 --> 28:09.106
Yes.

28:09.147 --> 28:10.148
Does Peter have access to it?

28:10.649 --> 28:12.609
Sure.

28:12.651 --> 28:15.112
He has a limit,
but he's never gone over it.

28:15.153 --> 28:18.657
Mrs. Locke, when was the last
time you took the boat out?

28:19.158 --> 28:20.117
Friday night.

28:20.159 --> 28:21.160
Peter and some of
his friends

28:21.660 --> 28:22.661
took it out
for one last hurrah

28:23.162 --> 28:23.662
before it gets too cold.

28:24.163 --> 28:24.663
Do you know which friends?

28:25.164 --> 28:27.166
I was already in bed. Sorry.

28:27.666 --> 28:30.669
Do you mind if the CSIs
take a look at it?

28:30.669 --> 28:31.670
Sure.

28:32.171 --> 28:34.673
Have the boys been drinking beer
on the boat again?

29:07.706 --> 29:10.709
Everyone told me I
was the best Gretel ever.

29:34.233 --> 29:36.235
My dad used
to take me sailing

29:36.235 --> 29:37.194
when I was a kid.

29:37.236 --> 29:38.737
Do you know
what the inboard end

29:38.737 --> 29:40.739
of an anchor rope is called?

29:40.739 --> 29:42.741
"The bitter end."

29:49.748 --> 29:52.251
This explains why
we're not finding any blood.

30:05.764 --> 30:06.723
Hey!

30:06.765 --> 30:08.225
Hey!

30:08.267 --> 30:10.727
Sara, did you find any gum
on that boat?

30:10.769 --> 30:13.772
Any gum at all-
wrapped, unwrapped- anywhere?

30:13.772 --> 30:14.773
Yeah...

30:15.274 --> 30:16.233
How did you know that?

30:16.275 --> 30:17.776
I think Cassie
was on that boat-

30:18.277 --> 30:20.237
alive.

30:20.279 --> 30:22.281
I think she was
leaving us a trail...

30:22.281 --> 30:23.740
of gum, "gum drops. "

30:23.782 --> 30:27.786
In the driveway,
in the car, on the boat.

30:27.786 --> 30:29.246
It was like Hansel and Gretel.

30:29.288 --> 30:31.790
Half the pictures I've
see n her in, she's chewing gum.

30:31.790 --> 30:33.292
Nick, that's a bit of a stretch.

30:33.292 --> 30:34.793
A lot of people chew gum.

30:35.294 --> 30:37.296
You tell Sheriff Brackett;
I'll meet you at the station

30:37.296 --> 30:39.798
Peter, we know
you were in Mark's car.

30:39.798 --> 30:41.258
We found
your ATM receipt.

30:41.300 --> 30:44.761
We also know you guys took
the boat out Friday night.

30:44.803 --> 30:48.807
We know that there were
three people involved.

30:48.807 --> 30:50.809
Who was the third?

30:53.312 --> 30:55.814
Peter, we found your prints
on a cough syrup bottle,

30:55.814 --> 30:56.815
underneath
Cassie McBride's bed.

31:01.320 --> 31:03.322
Your buddy Mark's not talking.

31:03.322 --> 31:04.823
He's gonna pay for that.

31:04.823 --> 31:06.783
You be smarter.

31:06.825 --> 31:09.328
You do the right thing.

31:48.867 --> 31:50.869
Dead bodies
don't suck their thumbs.

32:19.398 --> 32:20.357
How'd you hurt
your hand?

32:20.399 --> 32:21.900
What's the matter,
she fight back?

32:21.900 --> 32:23.402
You tried to drug her,
but guess what?

32:23.402 --> 32:24.361
She was too smart for you.

32:24.403 --> 32:25.904
You coached
the little girls' swim team,

32:25.904 --> 32:27.406
'cause you liked
to watch 'em

32:27.447 --> 32:29.408
in their bathing suits,
is that it?

32:29.449 --> 32:32.161
You're gonna answer me
right now!

32:32.202 --> 32:34.913
No more screwing around!
Where is she?!

32:35.914 --> 32:37.416
Where is she?

32:39.418 --> 32:40.419
Where is she?

32:50.387 --> 32:52.347
Okay, my guess

32:52.389 --> 32:54.391
is the guys stopped
at the ATM to get cash for gas.

32:54.892 --> 32:56.643
That's cash only,
and Eddie over there says

32:56.685 --> 32:58.395
he filled the tank
to the top Friday night.

32:58.437 --> 32:59.897
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

32:59.938 --> 33:01.356
Sure, what's up?

33:01.398 --> 33:03.400
I think I need to talk about
what happened at the station.

33:03.901 --> 33:06.361
Oh, yeah.

33:06.403 --> 33:08.906
I'm slightly concerned abo
ut its effect on the case,

33:09.406 --> 33:10.407
but more than that,
I'm concerned about

33:10.449 --> 33:11.867
the case's effect on you, Nick,

33:11.909 --> 33:15.913
and I'm absolutely s
ure that, six months ago,

33:15.954 --> 33:17.414
you wouldn't have lost it like that.

33:17.456 --> 33:19.208
I know, I'm sorry.

33:19.208 --> 33:20.918
I apologize for that.

33:21.418 --> 33:23.420
How much gas was left?

33:23.462 --> 33:25.380
Three-quarters of a tank.

33:25.422 --> 33:27.925
Took an eighth to get out
there, an eighth to get back,

33:28.425 --> 33:29.426
and according
to the gas mileage,

33:29.468 --> 33:31.386
on the Lockes' boat,

33:31.428 --> 33:33.430
that would have been
about three miles out

33:33.472 --> 33:35.432
from this launch point

33:35.474 --> 33:36.725
right here.

33:36.725 --> 33:37.935
Come on.

33:39.937 --> 33:41.438
Nick?

33:41.480 --> 33:42.940
Yeah?

33:59.456 --> 34:02.459
This is th
three-mile line.

34:29.987 --> 34:34.992
I used to love going to the lake,

34:35.033 --> 34:37.494
but not anymore.

34:52.009 --> 34:54.011
There's something there.

35:32.549 --> 35:34.551
Where's the fourth?

35:34.593 --> 35:36.553
We only found three.

35:40.057 --> 35:41.517
C.O.D.?

35:41.558 --> 35:43.060
Gunshot wound to the chest

35:43.560 --> 35:45.020
Though it appears

35:45.062 --> 35:47.064
to have gone
through his hand first.

35:48.565 --> 35:50.567
Dad wrestled with the gun, huh?

35:53.570 --> 35:55.030
Anything else?

35:55.072 --> 35:57.032
Contact wound
on the boy

35:57.074 --> 35:59.576
Shot up-close and personal.

35:59.618 --> 36:02.079
Mom was shot twice
in the back.

36:02.120 --> 36:03.580
Not up-close.

36:05.082 --> 36:07.584
Rinsed and ready for you.

36:12.089 --> 36:15.592
.22... probably
from a revolver.

36:15.634 --> 36:17.594
Six shots.

36:18.095 --> 36:19.596
Four in the bodies,
two in the lock.

36:20.097 --> 36:21.598
Well, that would explain
why we didn't find

36:21.640 --> 36:23.100
Cassie's blood in the house.

36:23.141 --> 36:24.101
They ran out of bullets.

36:26.103 --> 36:27.604
Sara, the bullets pulled
from the bodies

36:27.646 --> 36:29.106
were from
a.22-caliber revolver.

36:29.147 --> 36:31.066
IBIS bounced back a hit.

36:31.108 --> 36:33.610
They were entered into IBIS from
the Department of Wildlife,

36:33.652 --> 36:36.613
for shooting a deer
with a small caliber handgun.

36:36.655 --> 36:38.907
Firearm was returned
to the owner-

36:38.907 --> 36:41.118
a Chris Daniels
from Pioche, Nevada.

36:48.125 --> 36:49.585
Hey, Dennis, what's up?

36:49.626 --> 36:51.086
Hey, just in time
for steaks.

36:51.128 --> 36:55.632
Mr. Daniels, do you, uh...
do you own a.22 revolver?

36:55.674 --> 36:57.092
You know the answer to that.

36:57.134 --> 37:00.137
You cited it and fined me
two hunting seasons ago.

37:00.179 --> 37:03.140
Sir, I'm Sara Sidle from
the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

37:03.182 --> 37:06.643
It's evidence in a
homicide investigation

37:06.685 --> 37:08.187
I'm going to need it.

37:08.187 --> 37:09.605
Dad, how long on the steaks?

37:09.646 --> 37:12.649
We're going to need
to speak to Luke

37:12.691 --> 37:14.151
What did you do with my gun?

37:15.652 --> 37:16.904
If you did anything
to jeopardize

37:16.945 --> 37:18.155
that football scholarship
of yours,

37:18.655 --> 37:19.656
you're done.

37:38.675 --> 37:40.677
Duck your head.

37:46.683 --> 37:48.185
Found this in his pocket

37:48.685 --> 37:50.687
when I patted him down.

37:50.729 --> 37:52.689
Tested positive for blood.

37:54.191 --> 37:55.192
As did these.

38:19.716 --> 38:23.720
You just wanted to
intimidate Jeremy, right?

38:23.762 --> 38:25.222
Scare him a little

38:29.726 --> 38:34.231
ily. But Mr. McBride was still
ho me and he didn't scare so eas

38:34.731 --> 38:36.733
You guys have to go.
My parents are still home.

38:36.775 --> 38:38.735
Dude, I thought you said
there were pounds of pot.

38:38.777 --> 38:40.195
You guys got to get out, okay?

38:40.237 --> 38:41.738
Please, just get out
of here, all right

38:42.239 --> 38:44.741
Just listen to him, man. Do what he
says. Jeremy! Jeremy, what's going on?

38:44.783 --> 38:45.242
Jeremy, what's going on?

38:50.747 --> 38:52.249
What the hell did you just do?

38:54.251 --> 38:56.003
Mrs. McBride
came downstairs,

38:56.044 --> 38:57.754
so you had to
shoot her, too

39:00.257 --> 39:02.259
Peter went upstairs
to deal with Cassie.

39:05.762 --> 39:09.016
... while you and Mark bagged the pot

39:09.057 --> 39:12.269
and wrapped the bodies
in garbage bags.

39:12.311 --> 39:15.772
But... Peter couldn't do it.

39:18.775 --> 39:21.278
He couldn't kill Cassie.

39:22.279 --> 39:25.782
...so he tried
to drug her.

39:26.283 --> 39:29.036
You guys got into Mark's car,

39:29.077 --> 39:31.205
you went to the ATM,
you got cash,

39:31.205 --> 39:33.248
boat, you picked up Peter's

39:33.290 --> 39:34.750
you went back
to the McBrides'

39:34.791 --> 39:36.293
at. and you loaded
the bodies onto the bo

39:39.796 --> 39:42.549
You were out of bullets,

39:42.591 --> 39:45.260
way out on the lake.

39:45.302 --> 39:49.181
One small, loose end to tie up.

39:49.223 --> 39:50.766
Bring her over here.
No!

39:50.807 --> 39:52.809
She can identify us!
There's no way

39:52.851 --> 39:54.269
she's staying alive.

39:54.311 --> 39:56.772
I said she
was a strong swimmer.

39:56.813 --> 39:59.316
I didn't say we could throw
a drugged ten-year-old

39:59.358 --> 40:00.317
into the lake.

40:06.323 --> 40:08.826
Did it make you feel like
a man...

40:08.867 --> 40:10.327
to kill a little girl?

40:58.876 --> 41:01.378
Stop the boat.
Stop the boat.

41:01.420 --> 41:03.881
Let me out. Let me out.

41:59.436 --> 42:01.438
Hi.

42:18.956 --> 42:20.958
You're welcome, sweetie.

42:35.472 --> 42:37.474
They're in Vegas.

42:52.990 --> 42:55.492
Their bodies are in the
coroner's office, honey.

43:00.998 --> 43:04.459
Hey, Cassie...

43:04.501 --> 43:08.505
I know when bad things happen,
it's hard to remember.

43:10.507 --> 43:15.512
But if I give you some details,
do you think you could tell me

43:15.554 --> 43:18.515
the story of what happened
to your family?

43:22.519 --> 43:24.021
Okay.

43:24.521 --> 43:26.023
Okay.

43:28.525 --> 43:31.528
We'll go slow, okay?

43:35.032 --> 43:40.537
And we'll just beg
in at the beginning, okay

43:49.546 --> 43:53.050
They came to... my house.

43:56.553 --> 43:59.556
They had a fight.

44:00.057 --> 44:03.560
They couldn't find what
they were looking for.

44:08.065 --> 44:11.068
I loved my family.
