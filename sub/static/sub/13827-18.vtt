have some fun blow up a sun, leave a solar
system in an endless state of darkness

17:25.337 --> 17:28.841

their last poses of anguish,

17:28.924 --> 17:31.677

We are sorry about the mess.

Wha...a-apologize?
You really expect me to beg for mercy?

Ha! Fat chance, you sad,
pathetic excuse for a crime lord.

what you tell them to do!

SYLVIA: What, like robots?
That's not what friends do!

Friends help each other out,
but they're still their own people!

Speaking of which, how about helping me
fight off this thing?

20:05.622 --> 20:08.792

for that friend of yours.

I have no idea. And trust me,
she's not my friend.

So today I learned that friends are dumb,
and way overrated.

They don't do what you tell them to do,
and sometimes,

21:24.701 --> 21:26.620
they even try and tell you what to do.

21:26.745 --> 21:27.829
Can you believe that?

21:27.955 --> 21:31.124
I don't even know why everyone makes
such a big deal about them.
