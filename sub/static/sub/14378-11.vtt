right to the point.

no argument there!

you're so smart,

up a couple of grades!

14:55.266 --> 14:57.383

any other way.

to say about this?

Uh, I think I have a doctor's
excuse for that question.

15:18.483 --> 15:20.466
That's just it--
you've managed

15:21.000 --> 15:23.233
to have an excuse
out of gym class

15:23.266 --> 15:24.316
every single day!

15:24.350 --> 15:27.216
Not only do you
need to exercise
your mind,

15:27.250 --> 15:30.166
but exercise
your body as well--

15:30.200 --> 15:34.116
which he obviously
has not done ever.

intimidate his classmates

as well as academics!

Remember that wrestling
match where bad ace,
the title champion,

15:49.466 --> 15:54.100
delivered a terrible blow
to the midsection
of Kurt the krusher?

15:54.133 --> 15:55.100
Uh, no.

15:55.133 --> 15:56.033
Sure you do!

15:56.066 --> 15:57.433
Now, I want you
to punch me

15:57.466 --> 15:59.200
just like that!

15:59.233 --> 16:01.233
But I don't want to!

16:01.266 --> 16:02.466
Come on! I can take it!

16:03.000 --> 16:05.333
Show this guy the stuff
you're made of!

16:05.366 --> 16:09.083

Aah! [Coughs]

16:31.333 --> 16:34.000
Honey,
you can stop now.

16:34.033 --> 16:36.066
Not buying it?
Nope.

16:37.200 --> 16:41.433
Dexter simply has to pass
just one p.E. Event.

16:41.466 --> 16:43.400
Can you do that, Dexter?

16:43.433 --> 16:45.150
Bring it on!

16:45.183 --> 16:46.066
Let's see now...

17:51.016 --> 17:53.400
when I cheat on my
p.E. Exam next week.

17:53.433 --> 17:55.233

17:55.266 --> 17:58.200
You can't cheat! No brother

it would be a snap.
