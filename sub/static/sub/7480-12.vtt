(jazz fusion playing on radio)

00:15.515 --> 00:17.516
(sighs)

00:25.658 --> 00:26.909
You're not changing that.

00:27.746 --> 00:29.963
How can you listen to this?

00:29.964 --> 00:32.829
Why can't you appreciate
a little improvisational jazz?

00:32.830 --> 00:34.547
Why can't they all learn
to play the same song?

00:34.632 --> 00:35.965
It's called fusion.

00:36.016 --> 00:38.551
Yeah, confusion.

00:38.636 --> 00:40.603
(phone chirping)

00:40.671 --> 00:42.939
That's the Agent Needs
Assistance Alert.

00:43.006 --> 00:44.941
It's Hetty.

00:45.008 --> 00:45.808
(engine starts)

00:49.504 --> 00:50.704
You just gonna run out of here?

00:51.041 --> 00:52.475
I'm sorry.

00:52.581 --> 00:53.765
I'm on call.

00:53.850 --> 00:55.550
I thought you said you were
a dental hygienist.

00:55.601 --> 00:57.102
I am.

00:57.186 --> 00:58.770
It's a dental emergency.

00:58.855 --> 01:00.105
Oh... huh.

01:00.189 --> 01:02.190
It's, it's just, uh,
teeth missing,

01:02.258 --> 01:03.392
tons of blood.

01:03.443 --> 01:05.394
I will call you.

01:05.444 --> 01:06.862
(door opens)

01:06.929 --> 01:08.596
(door closes)

01:13.202 --> 01:14.736
Is this a legit alert?

01:14.787 --> 01:16.738
Sounds like it.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.107
Ah.

01:19.158 --> 01:20.709
Sorry.

01:20.776 --> 01:23.462
You, uh, you
missed a button.

01:23.546 --> 01:25.080
Oh, well, you heard the guy.

01:25.131 --> 01:27.132
He was this close
from giving up his partner.

01:27.216 --> 01:28.967
I had him eating
out of my hand.

01:29.052 --> 01:31.503
How was that?

01:31.587 --> 01:33.672
Just drive.

01:33.756 --> 01:35.223
Uh-huh.

01:35.291 --> 01:36.758
What do we know, Eric?

01:36.809 --> 01:38.060
Hetty activated
her phone's distress code.

01:38.127 --> 01:40.479
I tried to reach her
in case it was a false alarm,

01:40.563 --> 01:43.398
but she's not answering
any of her numbers.

01:43.466 --> 01:45.684
NELL: I want feeds from every traffic
and surveillance cam

01:45.768 --> 01:47.802
in a half-mile radius
for the past three hours.

01:47.854 --> 01:49.104
- You got it.
- Signal's coming from the boatshed

01:49.155 --> 01:50.522
but someone's disabled
our eyes inside.

01:50.606 --> 01:53.075
What about the teleconference
camera or her cell phone?

01:53.142 --> 01:54.076
Teleconference
has been unplugged.

01:54.143 --> 01:55.193
This is her cell phone.

01:58.498 --> 01:59.739
We're blind.

02:21.005 --> 02:22.706
ERIC:
Hetty had a radiant heat grid

02:22.790 --> 02:24.791
wired into the walls
and ceiling of the boatshed,

02:24.858 --> 02:26.543
so thermal imaging is useless.

02:26.627 --> 02:28.495
We know her phone's inside,

02:28.562 --> 02:30.297
we just don't know if she is.

02:30.364 --> 02:31.998
I walked the perimeter;
I don't see any signs

02:32.049 --> 02:33.216
that the place is booby-trapped.

02:33.301 --> 02:34.867
How we doing on a visual, Kensi?

02:38.205 --> 02:40.757
KENSI: You should be seeing
something right about...

02:40.841 --> 02:42.726
now.

02:42.810 --> 02:44.177
All right, we got her.

02:45.713 --> 02:46.813
Anyone else?

02:48.716 --> 02:49.649
Let me see.

02:54.021 --> 02:55.772
We got a bogey under the stairs.

02:58.025 --> 03:00.193
(door opens)

03:04.081 --> 03:05.398
Hetty?

03:05.499 --> 03:08.335
You okay?

03:08.402 --> 03:10.403
Peachy.

03:19.296 --> 03:21.715
Care to tell me
what this is all about?

03:21.766 --> 03:24.300
Ask him.

03:27.638 --> 03:30.023
Special Agent G. Callen.

03:31.609 --> 03:32.976
Who are you?

03:33.060 --> 03:34.227
The direct approach.

03:34.278 --> 03:35.862
You know, that's
an interesting tactic

03:35.929 --> 03:38.531
unless, of course, you walk
directly into a trap.

03:38.599 --> 03:41.618
Is that what this is?

03:41.702 --> 03:43.403
Could be.

03:51.779 --> 03:53.296
I know you.

03:53.381 --> 03:55.498
Not nearly as well
as I know you.

03:58.252 --> 04:00.253
You know them, too?

04:02.139 --> 04:04.340
That's great, you brought
your entire team with you.

04:04.425 --> 04:08.895
Unfortunately, it makes it so
much easier to blow you all up.

04:13.567 --> 04:15.134
You twitch.

04:15.186 --> 04:16.302
I shoot.

04:16.353 --> 04:17.737
Is that a catch phrase?

04:17.805 --> 04:18.855
Who are you?

04:18.939 --> 04:21.241
Owen Granger.

04:21.308 --> 04:23.109
I'm your new assistant director.

04:23.160 --> 04:26.479
I told him this
was a bad idea.

04:26.530 --> 04:28.531
But he's the boss.

04:40.211 --> 04:42.512
What the hell
was all this about?

04:42.596 --> 04:44.848
I wanted to see
this team in action.

04:44.932 --> 04:47.133
You almost saw
this team kill you.

04:47.184 --> 04:49.886
That would have been awkward.

04:49.970 --> 04:51.471
We were in the middle
of an operation

04:51.522 --> 04:52.806
that could now be blown.

04:52.857 --> 04:54.140
I was listening in.

04:54.191 --> 04:56.192
If anything, I
probably saved Blye

04:56.277 --> 04:58.177
from having to fake
more than her identity.

04:58.229 --> 04:59.178
(scoffs)

04:59.230 --> 05:00.897
I'm sure he means a headache.

05:01.014 --> 05:04.234
So, Operations Center
briefing in 20 minutes.

05:04.318 --> 05:06.185
I'll answer all your
questions and concerns.

05:06.237 --> 05:07.287
KENSI:
It's almost

05:07.354 --> 05:08.455
4:00 in the morning.

05:08.522 --> 05:10.907
I must still be
on East Coast time.

05:10.991 --> 05:12.826
In that case, make it 30.

05:12.877 --> 05:14.026
Give you a chance

05:14.078 --> 05:15.378
to grab some coffee.

05:15.463 --> 05:18.331
I'm gonna take a nonfat latte
with an extra shot.

05:24.421 --> 05:27.891
You think it's too late
to get my old job back?

05:39.973 --> 05:41.798
<i>We operate in an era</i>
<i>in which we are faced</i>

05:41.799 --> 05:43.983
<i>with a multitude of enemies,</i>
<i>both at home and abroad.</i>

05:44.051 --> 05:46.586
Enemies with ever
increasing capabilities

05:46.654 --> 05:49.772
in terms of weaponry, tactics,

05:49.840 --> 05:53.009
and their ability to network.

05:53.077 --> 05:55.278
Are you wearing pajamas?

05:55.329 --> 05:57.797
I, uh, rushed in here
last night,

05:57.881 --> 05:59.882
thinking it was
a real emergency.

05:59.950 --> 06:01.801
Haven't had time to go home.

06:01.885 --> 06:04.954
Are those badgers?

06:05.005 --> 06:07.590
Polar bears.

06:09.143 --> 06:11.227
Deadliest animal in the Arctic.

06:13.097 --> 06:14.897
GRANGER:
Jones.

06:17.017 --> 06:20.186
Eight days ago, Brent Bolton
died in a local parking garage

06:20.271 --> 06:24.240
from what was reported to be
a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

06:24.308 --> 06:28.311
Unfortunately, there was
no surveillance video.

06:28.362 --> 06:32.882
The gun that killed him was
registered to his wife Mia.

06:32.950 --> 06:33.016
It was purchased 16 days
before the shooting.

06:35.485 --> 06:36.869
Now, both Bolton and his wife...

06:36.954 --> 06:40.039
We're in the middle of several
ongoing investigations.

06:40.124 --> 06:41.708
I'm aware of your open files,

06:41.792 --> 06:43.760
but right now,
this is a priority.

06:43.827 --> 06:45.345
Both Brent Bolton

06:45.429 --> 06:46.429
and his wife, Mia,

06:46.496 --> 06:48.514
are employed by
Brindell Research,

06:48.599 --> 06:52.051
an independent think tank
that works closely

06:52.136 --> 06:54.420
with the Department of Defense
on everything

06:54.488 --> 06:57.690
from economic policy
to weapons development.

06:57.775 --> 07:01.227
And what makes this anything
more than a domestic dispute?

07:01.312 --> 07:03.780
Mia Bolton reported that she
thought she was being watched.

07:03.847 --> 07:06.282
Well, maybe she just said that
to set up an alibi.

07:06.350 --> 07:09.702
I hope it's that simple.

07:09.787 --> 07:12.455
Access to their research
is worth billions,

07:12.522 --> 07:14.324
and even more to their enemies.

07:14.375 --> 07:17.210
I need you to determine
who killed Brent Bolton,

07:17.294 --> 07:19.462
and what, if any, information
has been compromised.

07:19.529 --> 07:21.631
I've already made arrangements
for Miss Jones

07:21.698 --> 07:23.633
to be brought into
Brindell Research

07:23.700 --> 07:26.002
as an interim replacement
for Brent Bolton.

07:26.053 --> 07:28.254
Nell is
an intelligence analyst,

07:28.339 --> 07:29.806
not an agent.

07:29.873 --> 07:32.392
If someone is going undercover,
it should be one of us.

07:32.476 --> 07:35.395
It's a think tank,
Agent Callen, not a cartel.

07:35.479 --> 07:37.096
Miss Jones has
the training,

07:37.181 --> 07:38.564
and besides having
an IQ that's higher

07:38.649 --> 07:40.650
than your combined
credit scores,

07:40.717 --> 07:44.187
Miss Jones was actively
recruited by Brindell Research,

07:44.238 --> 07:46.489
along with several
other think tanks,

07:46.573 --> 07:47.907
before winding up here.

07:47.991 --> 07:51.327
It's what we call
a "no-brainer."

07:51.395 --> 07:53.062
Keep me updated.

07:53.113 --> 07:56.282
Agent Blye, I'd like
to speak to you

07:56.367 --> 07:57.917
about your recent trips
to Hawaii

07:58.001 --> 07:59.268
when you get a chance.

08:06.210 --> 08:07.543
(phone ringing nearby)

08:10.580 --> 08:13.082
CALLEN: "Double, double,
toil and trouble."

08:16.920 --> 08:19.806
So, what, you're just going
to let this guy take over?

08:30.934 --> 08:32.452
What'd she say?

08:32.535 --> 08:34.070
Nothing.

08:34.121 --> 08:35.270
Literally.

08:35.322 --> 08:37.407
Okay, so maybe we should
talk to Director Vance.

08:37.457 --> 08:38.607
SAM:
And say what?

08:38.659 --> 08:40.543
He obviously approved it.

08:40.610 --> 08:42.611
Hell, it was probably his idea.

08:42.663 --> 08:44.130
Yeah, Sam's right.

08:44.214 --> 08:46.716
Whatever this is, it's playing
out above our pay grades.

08:46.783 --> 08:49.802
We go along with it
for the time being.

08:49.887 --> 08:51.053
You and Deeks check
out Mia Bolton.

08:51.121 --> 08:53.473
We'll work Brindell Research
with Nell.

08:59.646 --> 09:01.347
ERIC:
<i>So,</i>

09:01.432 --> 09:04.300
you're going undercover.

09:05.302 --> 09:07.353
Guess so.

09:07.438 --> 09:08.654
Cool, cool.

09:08.739 --> 09:10.690
Yeah, I never knew

09:10.774 --> 09:12.742
you'd been recruited by
a bunch of think tanks.

09:12.809 --> 09:13.976
Oh, no?

09:14.027 --> 09:15.995
Uh, no. You, uh,

09:16.079 --> 09:17.914
never mentioned it.
Hm.

09:17.981 --> 09:19.482
Well...

09:19.533 --> 09:23.419
Which is, I don't
know, kind of weird

09:23.487 --> 09:25.288
because, you know, you
think it would be something

09:25.339 --> 09:26.756
that would have come up.

09:26.823 --> 09:29.375
Well, I guess there are a lot of
things you don't know about me.

09:29.460 --> 09:31.660
Like what?

09:31.712 --> 09:34.397
Let's just focus
on the task at hand.

09:34.465 --> 09:36.466
Right.

09:39.052 --> 09:41.187
You know, just out
of curiosity's sake,

09:41.271 --> 09:45.775
um, what-what is your IQ?

09:45.842 --> 09:47.560
Ah... hm.

09:48.612 --> 09:52.532
Oh. Not telling
me that either?

09:52.616 --> 09:54.984
What can I say,
woman of mystery.

09:55.035 --> 09:56.035
Oh, yeah?

09:56.119 --> 09:58.454
Well, I got mysteries, too.

09:58.522 --> 09:59.855
Hm.

09:59.907 --> 10:01.791
Come on, what's the big deal?
I'll show you mine

10:01.858 --> 10:03.459
if you show me yours.

10:06.463 --> 10:08.631
Here's the paperwork you'll
need for Brindell Research.

10:08.698 --> 10:10.299
Thank you.

10:15.506 --> 10:17.340
I was talking... We were...

10:17.391 --> 10:20.709
We were talking about IQ scores.

10:20.761 --> 10:20.843
You know, I'm gonna
head up to OPS now,

10:22.679 --> 10:23.813
and, uh,

10:23.880 --> 10:26.432
coordinate that
surveillance feed.

10:27.518 --> 10:29.485
Maybe you could swing by
Wardrobe on your way

10:29.553 --> 10:32.321
and have them fit you
with some big boy pants.

10:36.777 --> 10:39.195
CALLEN: Hetty said Vance
had been threatening

10:39.246 --> 10:41.214
to put her on a shorter leash.

10:41.281 --> 10:43.583
This is more like a cage.

10:43.667 --> 10:46.285
Hetty doesn't do
well in captivity.

10:46.370 --> 10:48.904
You think this is somebody's way
of trying to squeeze her out?

10:48.956 --> 10:51.123
You don't have a
career like Hetty's

10:51.208 --> 10:52.925
without making a few enemies.

10:53.010 --> 10:55.511
She has managed to avoid
a lot of the back-stabbing

10:55.579 --> 10:57.413
by staying out of Washington.

10:57.464 --> 10:59.632
Maybe that's why
they sent Granger.

10:59.716 --> 11:02.585
Guy reeks of being the kind of
bureaucratic assassin

11:02.636 --> 11:04.720
(phone ringing) that can kill
your career with an e-mail.

11:04.771 --> 11:07.089
ERIC: Yo.
- How we doing, Eric?

11:07.140 --> 11:09.141
ERIC: Nell's been signed in
as Brent Bolton's

11:09.226 --> 11:10.810
replacement.
She's through to security,

11:10.894 --> 11:13.095
and is just heading
for Brent Bolton's office.

11:13.146 --> 11:14.897
- I'll let you know if she finds anything.
- Good.

11:14.948 --> 11:16.949
(beeps, buzzes, door unlocks)

11:23.073 --> 11:25.291
(sighs)

11:25.375 --> 11:27.376
(device chirping)

11:32.115 --> 11:34.116
(sighs)

11:36.219 --> 11:38.004
All right, Eric,

11:38.088 --> 11:39.805
can you hear me?
Loud and clear.

11:39.890 --> 11:42.341
(device chirping)

11:42.426 --> 11:45.294
Everything seems...
pretty normal.

11:45.345 --> 11:47.296
No listening devices
or cameras.

11:47.347 --> 11:48.764
(knock at door)

11:48.815 --> 11:51.267
Shoot. Someone's at the door.

11:51.318 --> 11:53.152
(chirping stops)

11:57.491 --> 11:58.858
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:58.942 --> 12:01.477
I don't mean to bother you.
I just saw you come in, so

12:01.528 --> 12:04.030
I just wanted to say
hello and welcome.

12:04.114 --> 12:07.500
Hello and... thank you.

12:07.584 --> 12:08.951
(laughs)

12:09.002 --> 12:10.036
Come on in.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.203
Thanks.

12:11.288 --> 12:12.755
Sure. Uh...

12:14.207 --> 12:16.042
So, you are...?

12:16.126 --> 12:17.593
I'm JT.

12:17.661 --> 12:19.178
Everybody calls me Thruster.

12:19.262 --> 12:20.698
Great.

12:20.699 --> 12:21.927
That was...
That was my call sign.

12:21.932 --> 12:23.382
I was a fighter pilot

12:23.467 --> 12:25.434
until I had to punch out
over Fallujah.

12:25.502 --> 12:26.852
You know, detached my retina.

12:26.937 --> 12:28.220
(hissing through teeth)

12:28.305 --> 12:29.505
Now I'm flying a desk.

12:29.556 --> 12:31.474
Oh, brother.

12:31.525 --> 12:33.726
So, you're replacing Brent?

12:33.810 --> 12:36.479
Is it true he died?

12:37.731 --> 12:41.200
Yeah. They say he shot himself.

12:41.284 --> 12:43.185
So, suicide?

12:43.236 --> 12:44.870
Well, spouse-icide is
more likely, you know.

12:44.955 --> 12:47.073
He and his wife, Mia,
both worked here.

12:47.157 --> 12:48.240
They fought so much,

12:48.325 --> 12:49.575
they were never allowed
on the same projects.

12:49.660 --> 12:51.160
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:51.211 --> 12:52.495
ERIC: What a gossip.

12:52.546 --> 12:54.163
His call sign
should have been "Yenta."

12:54.214 --> 12:55.548
This is for you.

12:55.632 --> 12:57.249
For me?

12:57.334 --> 12:59.802
This should, uh, should
help you get up to speed

12:59.869 --> 13:01.087
on all our
current projects.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.588
All rightie.

13:02.673 --> 13:05.224
Well... thanks.

13:05.308 --> 13:06.375
(laughs)
ERIC: And...

13:06.426 --> 13:07.376
his fly is open.

13:13.433 --> 13:15.935
(awkward laugh)

13:16.002 --> 13:17.987
(clears throat)
Yeah.

13:19.606 --> 13:21.223
What are you, eight?

13:24.111 --> 13:25.227
(computer chirping)

13:33.920 --> 13:35.921
(sighs)

13:40.761 --> 13:44.046
So, Assistant Director Granger,

13:44.097 --> 13:47.216
you moving
to the West Coast permanently?

13:47.267 --> 13:50.803
They don't let you out much,
do they, Beale?

13:50.887 --> 13:53.773
Why do you say that?

13:53.857 --> 13:55.391
Lucky guess.

13:55.442 --> 13:58.444
That and you kind of remind me
of one of those <i>Twilight</i> kids.

14:00.647 --> 14:02.148
(paper shuffling)

14:05.285 --> 14:09.071
So, uh, why's the new guy want
to talk about your Hawaii trips?

14:10.874 --> 14:14.126
- I don't know.
- Hmm.

14:14.211 --> 14:17.163
When I was there, I spoke to a
few Marines who knew my father.

14:17.247 --> 14:19.415
Spoke to them about what?

14:19.466 --> 14:22.501
About his death
and the day he died.

14:22.586 --> 14:25.137
I didn't hear anything
I hadn't already heard.

14:25.222 --> 14:29.842
Well, apparently, someone didn't
appreciate the questions.

14:29.926 --> 14:31.010
(door in house opening)

14:31.094 --> 14:32.795
Oh, and who do we have here

14:32.846 --> 14:33.979
meeting our murder
victim's wife?

14:34.064 --> 14:37.867
(camera shutter clicking)

14:37.934 --> 14:39.769
Could be her lawyer.

14:39.820 --> 14:41.403
(camera shutter clicking)

14:41.471 --> 14:42.838
KENSI:
Oh.

14:42.906 --> 14:44.774
Huh.

14:44.825 --> 14:47.076
Wow. And if so, apparently,

14:47.143 --> 14:50.196
the, uh, lawyer-client
privileges include benefits.

15:00.328 --> 15:02.312
(crowd chatter,
birds singing)

15:02.998 --> 15:04.549
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.801
You got it.

15:06.869 --> 15:08.870
SAM:
Right.

15:11.373 --> 15:13.007
Okay. (sighs)

15:13.058 --> 15:15.810
Kensi and Deeks spotted some guy
at Mia Bolton's house.

15:15.878 --> 15:17.979
They're taking him
to the boatshed for questioning.

15:18.046 --> 15:19.380
Thanks.

15:19.432 --> 15:21.983
Coffee cart gives you a
free latte on your birthday.

15:22.050 --> 15:23.568
Happy birthday, OLeg.

15:23.652 --> 15:25.103
I look like an OLeg?

15:25.187 --> 15:28.273
More than I look
like a Fareed.

15:28.357 --> 15:30.275
It's a nice park.

15:30.359 --> 15:32.160
You know, if somebody
was shadowing Mia Bolton,

15:32.227 --> 15:33.778
pretty good place
to do it from.

15:33.846 --> 15:35.914
You can see her
come and go to work.

15:37.249 --> 15:41.119
Yup. And they got
free City Wi-Fi.

15:42.671 --> 15:43.922
How convenient.

15:45.708 --> 15:47.876
Brindell Research employees get
tired of being cooped up.

15:47.927 --> 15:50.795
They come outside to grab
a coffee, soak up a little sun.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.013
Fire off a couple e-mails.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.631
They know they're supposed
to be encrypted,

15:53.716 --> 15:55.517
but even if they are,
they're still vulnerable,

15:55.584 --> 15:57.385
flying around along with
their cell phone calls.

15:57.436 --> 15:59.137
Finish their latte.

15:59.221 --> 16:01.589
They throw the empty cup
in the recycling bin.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.090
(camera snapping)

16:04.560 --> 16:05.643
Coffee cup has

16:05.728 --> 16:07.312
their name on it,
along with their fingerprints,

16:07.396 --> 16:09.597
which makes it easy to match up
with the business cards

16:09.648 --> 16:11.449
in the jar trying
to win the free muffin.

16:11.534 --> 16:13.117
He even knows
your birthday.

16:13.202 --> 16:15.153
And that's
just one guy.

16:15.237 --> 16:16.354
(wry chuckle)

16:16.422 --> 16:18.439
Then you got Bobby Fisher
over here.

16:19.875 --> 16:21.943
SAM: How many think
tank employees

16:21.994 --> 16:24.462
have taken up that
challenge at lunch?

16:24.547 --> 16:27.448
Sweet old guy that prods them
with small talk,

16:27.500 --> 16:28.950
(camera clicks)
gathers seemingly trivial

16:29.001 --> 16:30.468
personal information.

16:30.553 --> 16:33.087
Let's not forget
about future soccer Mom.

16:33.138 --> 16:34.506
(camera clicks)

16:34.623 --> 16:36.257
Babies are a magnet.

16:36.308 --> 16:38.977
Before you know it, she knows
the name and ages of your kids,

16:39.044 --> 16:41.145
what school they go to
and where they take karate.

16:41.230 --> 16:43.598
Of course you'd have to be
paranoid to think like that.

16:43.649 --> 16:44.983
Well, paranoid
or vigilant.

16:45.067 --> 16:48.436
And that's just low-tech
human intelligence gathering.

16:48.487 --> 16:50.304
Now, if you really wanted
to spy on Brindell Research,

16:50.356 --> 16:51.973
you would have to set
up somewhere close by

16:52.024 --> 16:54.242
so you could use a laser
mic or an EMR detector.

17:04.203 --> 17:05.653
(camera snapping)

17:05.704 --> 17:08.373
But it is good coffee.

17:08.457 --> 17:10.458
Damn good.

17:10.509 --> 17:13.962
Witnesses said that you and
your husband fought... a lot.

17:15.848 --> 17:18.332
We both had strong opinions.

17:18.384 --> 17:20.635
Why'd you buy a gun?

17:20.685 --> 17:24.806
I... I thought
someone had been following me.

17:24.857 --> 17:26.808
Did you tell the police that?

17:26.858 --> 17:27.858
No.

17:27.943 --> 17:29.978
But I told Brent

17:30.029 --> 17:31.980
and some of my co-workers.

17:32.031 --> 17:33.364
Did they believe you?

17:33.449 --> 17:35.567
Brent didn't.

17:35.651 --> 17:39.487
That's why
he took my gun.

17:39.538 --> 17:41.406
I thought
we were being followed.

17:41.490 --> 17:43.374
He got so angry with me
that he said

17:43.459 --> 17:45.043
he was going to get rid of it.

17:45.127 --> 17:46.878
But you never saw anyone?

17:48.881 --> 17:50.965
No.

17:51.033 --> 17:54.218
Brent left the car,
and I waited.

17:54.303 --> 17:56.404
After I heard

17:56.472 --> 17:59.674
the gun fire, I ran out
to see what had happened.

17:59.725 --> 18:02.760
I thought maybe it discharged
when he threw it away.

18:05.347 --> 18:08.266
But I found him...

18:08.350 --> 18:11.052
lying in the stairwell...

18:11.103 --> 18:13.054
in a pool of blood.

18:13.105 --> 18:15.222
The gun was beside him.

18:16.959 --> 18:18.726
And you still never saw anybody?

18:18.794 --> 18:20.778
No.

18:22.781 --> 18:26.117
I loved Brent, and I would
never do anything to hurt him.

18:27.870 --> 18:29.904
He wasn't just my husband.

18:29.955 --> 18:32.874
He was my... colleague...

18:32.925 --> 18:34.709
and...

18:34.777 --> 18:36.911
my best friend.

18:42.885 --> 18:44.802
Do you know what it's like

18:44.887 --> 18:47.555
to lose the one person you love

18:47.606 --> 18:51.059
more than anything
or anyone in the world, and

18:51.110 --> 18:55.313
you don't even know
who did it or... why?

18:59.201 --> 19:02.103
Maybe we should, uh...
we should take a break.

19:02.154 --> 19:03.905
Yeah, Kens?

19:06.075 --> 19:08.609
Yes.

19:08.661 --> 19:09.944
(seagulls calling,
bell clanging)

19:09.995 --> 19:11.996
KENSI:
Give you some water?

19:12.081 --> 19:14.115
- What's up with Kensi?
CALLEN: I don't know.

19:14.166 --> 19:16.551
Maybe it has something to do
with those trips to Hawaii

19:16.618 --> 19:18.319
that Granger wants
to talk to her about.

19:18.387 --> 19:19.754
(computer chimes)
What is it, Eric?

19:19.805 --> 19:22.173
Hey, I just wanted
to give you a heads-up

19:22.257 --> 19:23.424
about Assistant Director
Granger.

19:23.475 --> 19:24.792
What about him?

19:24.843 --> 19:26.094
Uh, he's on his way
to the boatshed.

19:26.145 --> 19:28.012
And there he is now.
Okay. Good-bye.

19:28.097 --> 19:30.148
(computer chimes)

19:30.232 --> 19:33.634
You guys keeping track of me?

19:33.686 --> 19:35.770
It's what we do.

19:37.472 --> 19:39.407
How's this coming?

19:39.474 --> 19:42.276
They're taking a break.

19:42.327 --> 19:44.412
You know, it's a funny
thing about interrogation.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.998
Some people think it's a
skill that can be taught

19:47.082 --> 19:49.534
like anything else.

19:49.618 --> 19:52.704
But the best have
a God-given gift

19:52.788 --> 19:55.339
that goes way beyond knowing
if somebody's telling the truth.

20:00.045 --> 20:03.514
It's like being able
to look into a person's soul

20:03.599 --> 20:06.217
and know their deepest secrets
and darkest fears.

20:08.187 --> 20:10.171
Now, that sounds
like a catch phrase.

20:10.222 --> 20:12.890
No, I... I think
I've seen this movie before.

20:15.811 --> 20:19.013
Look... I'm not here
to make friends,

20:19.064 --> 20:21.515
but I'm also

20:21.567 --> 20:23.184
not here to become your enemy.

20:23.235 --> 20:24.986
You need me, and I need someone

20:25.037 --> 20:27.238
to lead this unit
into the next millennia.

20:27.322 --> 20:29.373
We already have
an operations manager.

20:29.458 --> 20:33.194
You're here for Hetty.

20:33.245 --> 20:35.379
I'm here for a lot of things.

20:36.999 --> 20:38.332
Conventional wisdom is great

20:38.383 --> 20:39.917
when you're fighting
a conventional enemy,

20:40.002 --> 20:41.502
but that's not the case anymore.

20:41.553 --> 20:43.888
SAM:
Hetty has more skill,

20:43.972 --> 20:47.875
wisdom than any of us
could hope for.

20:47.926 --> 20:50.211
You know, your loyalty
would be admirable

20:50.262 --> 20:52.764
if it weren't
so operationally unsound.

20:52.848 --> 20:54.548
If I'd been

20:54.600 --> 20:57.351
a real enemy, I could have
killed the lot of you last night

20:57.402 --> 20:58.519
because of that blind loyalty.

20:58.570 --> 21:00.054
CALLEN:
Had you been a real enemy,

21:00.105 --> 21:04.075
Hetty would have had your head
on a stick before we got here.

21:04.159 --> 21:05.559
Yeah.

21:05.611 --> 21:09.614
I'm well aware of the urban
legend that is Henrietta Lange.

21:11.116 --> 21:14.702
Folklore is best suited
for the history books.

21:14.753 --> 21:17.588
Like it or not, the old guard
is changing, gentlemen.

21:17.673 --> 21:20.291
Now, one of you can rise up
and assume that challenge,

21:20.375 --> 21:22.260
or I'll find someone else
who can.

21:23.929 --> 21:25.296
Your choice.

21:29.134 --> 21:32.053
How does this guy fit
into your life?

21:32.104 --> 21:34.055
That's Roger...

21:34.106 --> 21:36.057
McAdams.

21:36.108 --> 21:38.425
He's just a friend.

21:38.477 --> 21:41.312
Roger's in insurance.
He's an actuary.

21:41.396 --> 21:43.948
Did your husband have a life
insurance policy with Roger?

21:44.032 --> 21:46.367
No. They didn't even
know each other.

21:46.434 --> 21:49.787
I met Roger
in my writing class.

21:49.872 --> 21:52.406
I needed a creative escape,
so I'm writing a novel.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.827
Oh, that's fantastic.
About what?

21:55.911 --> 21:58.379
It's a love story between
a noble woman and a young artist

21:58.446 --> 21:59.797
set in Vienna
during the Black Death.

21:59.882 --> 22:02.884
Nothing says romance
like the plague.

22:02.951 --> 22:05.002
And Roger?

22:05.087 --> 22:06.453
What's his novel about?

22:06.505 --> 22:08.389
He's writing a spy thriller.

22:13.345 --> 22:15.146
She looks like she hasn't
moved since we left.

22:15.230 --> 22:16.297
She hasn't.

22:16.348 --> 22:17.798
Maybe she ran out of batteries.

22:17.850 --> 22:19.066
You find something?

22:19.151 --> 22:21.152
ERIC: Roger McAdams
really is an actuary

22:21.236 --> 22:22.603
from an El Segundo
insurance company.

22:22.654 --> 22:23.738
The only problem is,

22:23.805 --> 22:25.406
he looks like this.

22:25.473 --> 22:27.808
As you can see, he is
clearly not the man

22:27.860 --> 22:29.026
from Mia Bolton's house.

22:30.779 --> 22:31.913
So, who is this guy?

22:31.980 --> 22:32.947
We don't know yet.

22:32.998 --> 22:34.165
Facial rec hasn't found a match.

22:34.249 --> 22:35.333
I was, however,
able to identify

22:35.417 --> 22:37.501
your friends from the park.

22:37.586 --> 22:39.754
Your coffee vendor
is Ari Peretz.

22:39.821 --> 22:42.173
He's a former Israeli national

22:42.257 --> 22:44.408
who became an American
citizen in 2007,

22:44.476 --> 22:47.328
after a career
in Jerusalem's Moustarabine.

22:47.379 --> 22:48.963
It means "those who
pretend to be Arabs".

22:49.014 --> 22:51.048
They're a no-joke
undercover army unit.

22:51.133 --> 22:52.833
Ooh, it gets better.

22:52.885 --> 22:54.185
Meet Faton Hoxha.

22:54.269 --> 22:56.520
He's a former Albanian
chess master,

22:56.605 --> 22:59.190
rumored to have worked
for the KGB before the

22:59.274 --> 23:01.142
Iron Curtain came crashing down.

23:01.193 --> 23:04.312
Like many,
he has denied it ever since.

23:04.363 --> 23:06.280
What about, uh, soccer mom?

23:06.348 --> 23:07.198
Oh, she checks out.

23:07.282 --> 23:08.532
She's actually

23:08.617 --> 23:10.201
just a soccer mom.
But two out of three

23:10.285 --> 23:12.353
people in this park have
intelligence experience

23:12.404 --> 23:13.704
from two different countries.

23:13.789 --> 23:16.707
That suggests they're working
for a private employer.

23:16.792 --> 23:18.009
Maybe they're helping
Mia Bolton's

23:18.076 --> 23:19.860
mystery man with his spy novel.

23:19.912 --> 23:22.296
You think Mia'd be up
to helping us get this guy?

23:22.364 --> 23:24.548
Can't hurt to ask.

23:32.474 --> 23:34.475
What if there are
two Roger McAdams?

23:34.542 --> 23:36.543
I wish there were, Mia.

23:36.595 --> 23:37.916
(exhales)
He was my friend.

23:37.941 --> 23:38.512
No,

23:38.513 --> 23:41.649
no, he was just
pretending to be.

23:43.602 --> 23:46.654
You don't have to do this.

23:49.691 --> 23:50.908
I want to...

23:52.060 --> 23:53.327
For Brent.

24:11.271 --> 24:12.300
MIA (via wire):
Hi.

24:12.301 --> 24:14.769
Sorry to call you in the middle
of the day like this.

24:14.837 --> 24:17.055
ROGER:
No, no, don't worry, it's fine.

24:17.106 --> 24:19.924
What's, uh, what's wrong?

24:19.975 --> 24:22.610
MIA:
I heard some things today

24:22.695 --> 24:25.446
that upset me.

24:25.531 --> 24:26.614
Uh, what sort of things?

24:30.569 --> 24:32.770
I'm sorry, I don't know
if I can do this.

24:32.821 --> 24:34.205
She's getting cold feet.

24:34.273 --> 24:35.273
Hang in there, Mia.

24:35.324 --> 24:36.774
Just hand him the thumb drive.

24:36.825 --> 24:38.126
CALLEN:
Get ready to move.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.778
If she breaks, we're gonna
have to take this guy.

24:40.829 --> 24:43.464
Hey, talk to me.

24:43.549 --> 24:45.300
What is it?

24:50.005 --> 24:51.973
This is what my husband, Brent,

24:52.057 --> 24:53.141
was working on.

24:53.225 --> 24:55.226
I think it may have been
what got him killed.

24:55.294 --> 24:56.844
I don't know what
to do with it.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.513
Good girl.

25:01.433 --> 25:02.317
Look at him.

25:02.401 --> 25:03.968
He's practically drooling.

25:04.019 --> 25:07.238
Um, maybe... maybe you
should give it to me.

25:07.306 --> 25:10.308
Just to...
just to be safe.

25:11.694 --> 25:13.161
What a mensch.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.530
I mean, hey, hey.

25:15.614 --> 25:17.582
We're friends,
Mia, right?

25:17.649 --> 25:19.817
You've gone through
a tough time, so...

25:19.868 --> 25:22.120
It's the least I can do.

25:22.171 --> 25:23.504
KENSI:
Now walk away, Mia.

25:23.589 --> 25:24.872
Just walk away.

25:24.957 --> 25:26.924
I have to go.

25:26.992 --> 25:29.327
Yeah, all right.

25:29.378 --> 25:32.213
I'll, uh, I'll call you.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.265
Okay.
Yeah.

25:43.726 --> 25:45.509
(engine starts)
He's moving, Eric.

25:45.561 --> 25:48.780
And we are tracking.

25:49.748 --> 25:51.866
Oh, look. Top goon's back.

25:51.900 --> 25:54.002
You're a fast reader.

25:54.069 --> 25:56.070
Well, I skimmed.

25:56.155 --> 25:58.956
You know, we, uh, we usually
let the newbies get settled

25:59.024 --> 26:00.541
for a couple days,
but there's

26:00.626 --> 26:02.460
a brainstorming session on
the European Financial Crisis

26:02.527 --> 26:04.462
at 2:30 if you want to sit in.

26:04.529 --> 26:06.197
- Sure.
- In the meantime,

26:06.248 --> 26:08.916
I am going to grab a
sandwich in the park,

26:09.001 --> 26:10.551
if you want to
join me for lunch.

26:10.669 --> 26:11.869
Yeah, I don't think so.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.137
Okay.

26:13.205 --> 26:14.088
What? This guy could

26:14.173 --> 26:15.723
be a serial killer
for all you know.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.392
Mmm.

26:17.476 --> 26:18.760
(high-pitched feedback)
(screams)

26:18.844 --> 26:19.644
You okay?

26:19.711 --> 26:21.012
Yeah, I just have this

26:21.063 --> 26:22.430
buzzing in my ear.

26:22.514 --> 26:25.516
This is so going
in my operations report.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.423
(car door closes, alarm chirps)

26:48.507 --> 26:50.708
Guy may have just been handed
the keys to the kingdom,

26:50.759 --> 26:52.960
and he decides
to get a haircut?

27:02.354 --> 27:03.421
SAM:
Hold it, he's coming back.

27:03.472 --> 27:04.806
(car alarm chirps)

27:05.974 --> 27:07.892
That was fast.

27:07.943 --> 27:10.194
Maybe they don't
take walk-ins.

27:12.764 --> 27:14.265
He's on the move again.

27:14.316 --> 27:16.651
He may be,
the flash drive isn't.

27:16.735 --> 27:18.286
He must have handed
it off to somebody.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.438
CALLEN: Kensi, follow him.
We'll hang with the thumb drive,

27:20.489 --> 27:23.357
see where it goes next.
- We're on him.

27:23.425 --> 27:25.626
(tires squealing)

27:25.694 --> 27:27.778
(gasps)
Son of a bitch!

27:27.830 --> 27:28.946
You guys okay?

27:28.997 --> 27:30.798
Yeah, but we're
losing the target.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.084
Just for the record, that's
called a side view mirror.

27:33.135 --> 27:34.635
(groans)

27:48.767 --> 27:50.935
(battle cries)

28:00.062 --> 28:01.245
(grunts and groans)

28:16.545 --> 28:18.546
(grunts)

28:26.054 --> 28:28.189
(Hetty groans)

28:30.809 --> 28:32.510
I was told you
were meditating.

28:32.561 --> 28:35.279
But I am.

28:35.347 --> 28:37.982
I see you've added
to your bag of tricks.

28:38.033 --> 28:40.201
Just a little exercise.

28:40.285 --> 28:42.570
More fun than the StairMaster.

28:42.654 --> 28:44.855
I was referring to your ability
to mesmerize your staff

28:44.907 --> 28:47.658
into believing
you're the second coming.

28:49.694 --> 28:54.465
My staff are a complementary
team of independent thinkers.

28:54.533 --> 28:58.252
And you would be wise not to
let your personal vendetta

28:58.337 --> 29:02.223
cloud your judgment
of them or me.

29:02.307 --> 29:06.894
Is this where you quote Sun Tzu
in a thinly veiled threat?

29:06.979 --> 29:09.397
I'll leave the clichés
to you, Owen.

29:09.481 --> 29:10.848
Your remaining time

29:10.899 --> 29:14.735
might best be spent getting your
affairs in order, Henrietta.

29:19.441 --> 29:21.776
I'm not afraid of you.

29:23.812 --> 29:26.831
That was your first mistake.

29:34.623 --> 29:36.574
(man coughing)

29:36.625 --> 29:37.959
(bottle rattles on floor)

29:45.684 --> 29:47.018
(doorknob rattling)

29:47.085 --> 29:48.636
(man groans)

29:58.063 --> 29:59.814
(coughs hard)

29:59.898 --> 30:00.931
Oh, hey, man.

30:00.983 --> 30:02.950
Hey, man, what's up, man?

30:03.035 --> 30:05.703
Hey, hey, man,
can I bum a smoke?

30:05.770 --> 30:08.956
I'll trade you a sip
for a cigarette.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.158
Oh, come on. Come on.

30:11.243 --> 30:12.410
Just give me a cigarette.

30:12.461 --> 30:14.128
I want a cigarette;
I'll give you a sip.

30:14.212 --> 30:15.379
Got the good stuff.

30:15.447 --> 30:18.165
(makes squeaky noises)

30:18.233 --> 30:20.251
Get lost.

30:21.003 --> 30:23.254
Oh...

30:23.305 --> 30:24.922
(coughing) Oh!

30:24.973 --> 30:26.257
Well...

30:26.308 --> 30:30.227
That was rude and
environmentally hostile, but...

30:30.295 --> 30:32.296
uh...

30:33.298 --> 30:36.651
I appreciate the DNA.

30:42.807 --> 30:45.693
Oh, and here we go.

30:52.918 --> 30:55.002
Well, looks like
I'm going inside.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.820
If I'm not back in ten minutes,

30:56.872 --> 31:00.124
it's 'cause I'm in trouble
or I'm getting a bikini wax.

31:01.326 --> 31:04.261
Welcome to my world.

31:04.329 --> 31:05.513
(chuckles)

31:06.548 --> 31:08.349
(indistinct chatter)

31:14.673 --> 31:16.607
Somebody's got to
feed these jellyfish.

31:16.675 --> 31:18.676
Otherwise, they
can't swim none.

31:18.727 --> 31:20.277
Oh, hey, man, hey, man,
can I use your bathroom?

31:20.345 --> 31:21.896
Get the hell
out of here!

31:21.980 --> 31:24.615
Yo, hold on, hold, hold!
Fire in the hole.

31:24.683 --> 31:25.866
Hold on, fire in the hole!

31:25.951 --> 31:27.401
Fire in the hole...

31:27.486 --> 31:29.520
Can I use your <i>baño</i> for two
seconds? Got to talk to a man

31:29.571 --> 31:31.122
about an elephant. Ow! Oh!

31:31.189 --> 31:34.041
DEEKS (mumbling):
I am the 99%.

31:34.126 --> 31:35.326
Hey, see you, boys!

31:35.377 --> 31:37.078
Sign says exit, I get you,
I get you, I get you.

31:37.162 --> 31:38.546
(crashing)

31:38.630 --> 31:40.381
Ahh!
You come back,

31:40.465 --> 31:41.916
I'm calling the cops.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.702
Okay. All right.

31:44.753 --> 31:47.638
Come on.

31:47.706 --> 31:49.807
DEEKS:
Well, that seemed excessive.

31:49.874 --> 31:51.875
ERIC:
Cameras are online, guys.

31:53.378 --> 31:54.895
(groans)

31:54.980 --> 31:57.214
Deeks, you okay?

31:57.265 --> 31:59.684
Mm... Oh...

31:59.735 --> 32:01.986
I think I went a
little too method.

32:02.053 --> 32:04.321
Might have shook
something loose.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.243
Tell me you're kidding.

32:11.279 --> 32:14.532
I'm kidding.

32:21.006 --> 32:22.673
(inhales deeply)

32:22.741 --> 32:26.794
<i>But</i> I may need
to make a pit stop.

32:26.878 --> 32:28.679
(engine starts)
Anybody want to trade partners?

32:30.182 --> 32:32.133
You're not getting this
anyplace else, mama.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.517
Huh?

32:33.585 --> 32:36.020
Looks like a data
retrieval operation.

32:36.087 --> 32:38.606
ERIC: The thumb drive we handed off
to Roger is still there.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.775
Probably being analyzed
by one of these guys.

32:40.859 --> 32:42.143
Check out the back wall.

32:42.227 --> 32:44.445
CALLEN: Those are security
shredding bins.

32:44.529 --> 32:47.097
They're used for sensitive
documents, data storage devices.

32:47.149 --> 32:48.399
That one's open.

32:48.450 --> 32:50.100
What are the chances
Brindell Research

32:50.152 --> 32:52.286
uses the same Steel Tower
data destruction company?

32:52.370 --> 32:54.288
I'd say pretty even.

32:54.372 --> 32:57.458
In fact I used one
at Brindell Research today.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.877
That's why Hetty insists on
destroying everything in house.

32:59.944 --> 33:01.779
I just assumed she liked
burning things.

33:01.830 --> 33:02.780
Eric.

33:02.831 --> 33:05.499
Everything I can find
on Steel Tower.

33:22.260 --> 33:24.678

33:26.047 --> 33:27.481
Anchors aweigh.

33:34.522 --> 33:35.722
Oh.

33:35.773 --> 33:37.774
Excuse me.

33:47.452 --> 33:49.536
(sighs)

33:51.539 --> 33:53.590
Tracking is online.

34:04.752 --> 34:07.020
A little whiplash
yesterday?

34:07.088 --> 34:09.056
No, I'm fine.

34:11.092 --> 34:13.360
You know, you never told me
about your father.

34:14.395 --> 34:16.563
Yes, I have.

34:17.565 --> 34:19.983
Not about how he died.

34:20.068 --> 34:23.770
That's 'cause I'm still trying
to figure that out myself.

34:23.821 --> 34:28.125
Just if, uh-- I don't know, if
you ever want to talk about it,

34:28.208 --> 34:31.161
I just... I know a thing or two
about fathers, so...

34:35.783 --> 34:38.618
You shot your father.

34:38.668 --> 34:41.121
One time.

34:41.172 --> 34:41.254
All right, it's not
like I killed the man.

34:42.623 --> 34:45.342
(chuckles)

34:45.426 --> 34:46.793
Well, I didn't say
I was an expert.

34:46.844 --> 34:47.978
I just meant that...
Heads up.

34:54.969 --> 34:57.320

<i>Juan Garcia worked</i>

35:34.508 --> 35:35.675

in part to pay for
his daughter Emma's college.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.181
Four months ago,
he received these--

35:41.232 --> 35:42.182
surveillance photos.

35:42.250 --> 35:43.683
This is his daughter Emma.

35:43.734 --> 35:46.203
Juan was told to stop shredding
Brindell Research bins

35:46.287 --> 35:48.521
and deliver them to our friends
at the hair salon.

35:48.573 --> 35:50.240
And if he didn't,
they'd hurt his daughter?

35:50.324 --> 35:52.025
Exactly.
He say

35:52.076 --> 35:53.359
who told him to do this?

35:53.411 --> 35:54.995
He wasn't given a name,
but he positively identified

35:55.046 --> 35:56.046
our old friend.

35:57.215 --> 35:58.515
KENSI:
Who still hasn't been identified

35:58.583 --> 36:01.034
and who we let get away.

36:01.085 --> 36:05.005
If by we, we mean you
because you were driving.

36:06.641 --> 36:07.874
So what do
we do now?

36:07.925 --> 36:10.210
We can't use Mia again.

36:10.261 --> 36:11.544
Well, you know
that photo you sent me?

36:11.596 --> 36:12.429
There is
an office space

36:12.513 --> 36:13.730
rented in
the building

36:13.815 --> 36:15.565
across the street from
Brindell Research.

36:15.650 --> 36:17.550
I looked at the list of tenants,

36:17.602 --> 36:19.820
but I wasn't actually able
to find out who owns it

36:19.887 --> 36:22.405
'cause it's an LLC registered
in a nondisclosure state.

36:22.490 --> 36:24.157
I did find something.

36:24.225 --> 36:25.558
Their security is a joke,

36:25.610 --> 36:28.161
which is probably another reason
why they like the building.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.896
It's our guy-- Roger.

36:29.947 --> 36:31.832
Phony Roger.

36:31.899 --> 36:33.350
CALLEN: I think we've got
everything we need.

36:33.417 --> 36:35.401
Time to pay him
a visit.

36:35.453 --> 36:36.620
(door bursts open)

36:36.704 --> 36:38.788
Federal agents.
Hands where we can see 'em.

36:39.907 --> 36:41.091
MAN:
What the hell is this?

36:45.379 --> 36:47.380
You boys look like
you're up to no good.

36:48.415 --> 36:50.517
Lawyer.

36:50.584 --> 36:51.518
Federal agent.

36:51.585 --> 36:53.753
Hmm, funny.

36:53.804 --> 36:56.356
I want my lawyer.

36:58.192 --> 37:01.261
The longer you stall,
the longer my rights are denied.

37:01.312 --> 37:02.729
It only hurts you.

37:02.780 --> 37:05.765
That's true-- if we were cops
and you weren't stealing

37:05.816 --> 37:07.868
classified Department of Defense
secrets.

37:07.935 --> 37:10.120
You see, we're federal agents
and you have violated

37:10.204 --> 37:14.291
a number of National
Security laws, at least...

37:14.375 --> 37:15.208
A dozen.

37:15.276 --> 37:16.877
Yikes, I was
gonna say seven,

37:16.944 --> 37:19.496
but we have a little
thing called the, uh,

37:19.580 --> 37:20.997
war on terrorism.

37:21.082 --> 37:22.132
Maybe you've heard of it.

37:22.216 --> 37:23.950
KENSI:
I hope he buys this.

37:24.001 --> 37:26.619
Not to mention the
murder of Agent Griffin.

37:26.671 --> 37:29.089
Special Agent Ian Griffin.

37:32.293 --> 37:35.228
His partner saw
you murder him.

37:35.296 --> 37:39.182
That would be Special
Agent Reece Watson.

37:39.267 --> 37:43.687
You knew them as Mia
and Brent Bolton.

37:43.771 --> 37:48.191
Your surveillance is mediocre,
your countersurveillance...

37:48.276 --> 37:49.859
Sucks.

37:49.944 --> 37:51.077
Bad.

37:51.145 --> 37:53.496
CALLEN:
What can I say?

37:53.581 --> 37:55.749
You got played.

37:55.816 --> 37:57.317
I didn't kill anybody.

37:57.368 --> 37:58.752
Your word against
a federal agent.

38:02.206 --> 38:04.291
Look, I wasn't even armed.

38:04.342 --> 38:05.792
Okay?

38:05.843 --> 38:07.928
I was just
tailing 'em.

38:07.995 --> 38:08.995
Bolton pulled
his gun on me.

38:09.046 --> 38:10.046
I tried to get
away from him.

38:10.131 --> 38:11.631
I shoved him down the stairs,

38:11.682 --> 38:14.100
the gun went off when he fell.

38:14.168 --> 38:16.937
That's the truth.

38:17.004 --> 38:19.356
You'd swear to that?

38:19.440 --> 38:21.224
Yes.

38:23.761 --> 38:25.362
Yes!

38:29.683 --> 38:31.067
(clears throat)

38:31.152 --> 38:32.202
No.

38:33.237 --> 38:35.956
Yeah.

38:36.023 --> 38:37.741
So what do we
tell Mia Bolton?

38:37.825 --> 38:39.025
(sighs)

38:39.076 --> 38:42.829
The truth-- that her husband
died protecting her.

38:42.880 --> 38:43.964
(door opens)

38:44.031 --> 38:45.882
They still inside?

38:45.967 --> 38:48.301
Hey.
Yeah, but you can't go in there.

38:48.369 --> 38:50.303
Hey.

38:50.371 --> 38:52.222
Nice work.

38:52.306 --> 38:53.640
What are you doing?

38:53.707 --> 38:55.041
We'll take it from here.
We're not finished here.

38:55.092 --> 38:56.309
GRANGER:
Yeah,

38:56.377 --> 38:58.094
you are, and you did
a great job, seriously.

38:58.179 --> 38:59.929
I thought this would
take you guys weeks.

39:00.014 --> 39:02.599
I am genuinely impressed.

39:06.937 --> 39:08.405
I'm sorry, guys.

39:08.489 --> 39:10.407
He just walked
right in there.

39:10.491 --> 39:11.691
Granger.

39:12.726 --> 39:14.778
That's Assistant Director
Granger,

39:14.862 --> 39:16.162
Agent Hanna.

39:16.230 --> 39:17.497
Our conversation is gonna
have to wait, Blye.

39:17.564 --> 39:20.250
Now, in the interim,
you stay out of Hawaii.

39:20.334 --> 39:21.734
CALLEN:
So, what, you hand him off

39:21.786 --> 39:24.587
to one of the other agencies
for some bureaucratic favors?

39:24.672 --> 39:26.122
You see, now
you're catching on.

39:26.207 --> 39:29.342
I told you NCIS is part
of a bigger whole.

39:29.410 --> 39:31.127
Welcome to the big picture.

39:35.082 --> 39:35.597
(sighs)

39:35.622 --> 39:37.356
SAM: We catch him, Granger
gets the glory.

39:37.935 --> 39:39.019
This is my fault.

39:39.086 --> 39:40.920
How do you figure?

39:40.971 --> 39:42.355
I should have let you shoot him.

39:42.423 --> 39:45.392
Well, it's probably not too late
if you run out there.

39:49.280 --> 39:53.199
Won't be needing
this anymore.

39:53.267 --> 39:57.570
Guess this means
no more lunches with Thruster.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.658
Sorry, I was just, um...

40:01.742 --> 40:04.077
Jealous.

40:04.128 --> 40:05.445
Looking out
for you.

40:05.496 --> 40:07.447
That's what partners do.

40:07.498 --> 40:09.049
We're not partners.

40:10.835 --> 40:13.837
Well, I mean,
we sort of are, aren't we?

40:13.921 --> 40:15.839
Callen has Sam,
Kensi has Deeks.

40:15.923 --> 40:17.841
We're like the partners
of OPS.

40:17.925 --> 40:20.626
Guess so.

40:20.678 --> 40:21.794
I mean, come on,
we're clearly

40:21.846 --> 40:23.313
the two coolest people
up here.

40:24.348 --> 40:25.765
And the smartest.

40:25.816 --> 40:27.183
I mean, your IQ
is like what?

40:27.268 --> 40:28.935
It's like...?

40:29.970 --> 40:32.638
Nell, okay,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40:32.690 --> 40:34.190
Partner?

40:34.275 --> 40:36.776
(phone ringing in distance)

40:40.814 --> 40:44.317
Well, aren't you a
sorry-looking bunch?

40:44.368 --> 40:45.502
I was beginning
to think that Granger

40:45.569 --> 40:47.087
had turned you into stone.

40:47.154 --> 40:51.958
Never mistake motionlessness
for inactivity, Mr. Callen.

40:52.009 --> 40:56.012
Crocodiles get most
of their meals that way.

40:58.048 --> 40:59.716
Granger took our guy.

40:59.800 --> 41:04.687
Yes, but you solved the mystery
of Brent Bolton's death

41:04.772 --> 41:09.025
and broke up a spy ring that was
threatening national security.

41:09.110 --> 41:10.676
You should all be proud.

41:10.728 --> 41:11.978
What were you
hoping for,

41:12.046 --> 41:15.732
a ticker tape parade
and a photo op?

41:15.816 --> 41:16.950
We were hoping

41:17.017 --> 41:18.351
to follow through with it.

41:18.402 --> 41:22.238
Patience, Mr. Callen;
this is far from over.

41:22.323 --> 41:24.908
Now, I want you
to all get out of here.

41:24.992 --> 41:26.192
I have a standing
reservation

41:26.243 --> 41:29.546
for a private room
at the Geisha House,

41:29.630 --> 41:31.714
but they'll only
hold it until 10:00.

41:32.666 --> 41:34.217
- Really?
- Well, no,

41:34.301 --> 41:37.870
they'll hold it until whenever
the hell I get there,

41:37.922 --> 41:41.374
but I want you
all out of here.

41:41.425 --> 41:43.443
D-Don't worry
about the bill.

41:43.511 --> 41:47.096
I'm expensing it
to our new assistant director.

41:47.181 --> 41:48.398
(Kensi chuckles)

41:48.482 --> 41:50.216
Nice.

41:50.267 --> 41:52.485
(laughs)

41:52.553 --> 41:53.736
DEEKS:
Wait a minute, Hetty,

41:53.821 --> 41:55.738
are you, uh...?

41:55.823 --> 41:56.940
You're not joining us?

41:57.024 --> 42:00.109
Not tonight, Mr.
Deeks, I have plans,

42:00.194 --> 42:01.661
but thank you
for asking.

42:01.728 --> 42:02.912
Of course.

42:11.372 --> 42:14.374
These plans of yours have
anything to do with Granger?

42:18.679 --> 42:20.129
He's here to
stay, isn't he?

42:20.214 --> 42:22.248
He's here definitely.

42:22.299 --> 42:25.018
How long he stays
remains to be seen.

42:25.085 --> 42:27.303
(sighs)

42:27.388 --> 42:29.088
Should I be
worried about you?

42:29.139 --> 42:31.858
Not as much as he should be.

42:33.527 --> 42:36.946
I don't suppose you want
to tell me the story of you two?

42:37.982 --> 42:40.116
It's still being written.

42:42.653 --> 42:46.206
Well, I hope it has
a happy ending.

42:46.231 --> 42:50.231
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00ff00>elderman</font> ==

42:56.000 --> 42:57.917
Not bloody likely.
