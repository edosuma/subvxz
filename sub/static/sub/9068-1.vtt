more of your lip.

you're not going to
sell her, are you?

Of course he's
gonna sell her.

I'll pick her up Wednesday.

But, Mr. Coggins,
you promised we
could play in her.

but she ain't any use to me.

we're gonna do with her,

in a fiery furnace,

You've frightened her.

See? She's a very

08:15.662 --> 08:19.123
If you put her in
the fiery furnace,
you'll be guilty of murder.

Yeah, and if you
don't get out of it,

08:21.126 --> 08:22.585

have been killed.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.088
Yes, we live just

there were any castles
around here.

Daddy calls it.

used to live there
hundreds of years ago.

you aren't in school?

he's awfully busy.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.359
that I nearly knocked down
your two children?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.945
Well, we do seem
to be accident-prone,
don't we?

13:00.029 --> 13:02.364
But it wasn't my fault.
You see, they came
rushing out. . .

13:02.449 --> 13:04.283
Oh, well, it was very,
very nice of you
to apologize.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.617
Apologize?
Tea time, children.

13:05.702 --> 13:06.785

13:06.870 --> 13:07.870

you two.

Don't you have
something to
tell your father?

13:11.332 --> 13:15.043
Yes, we have.
Daddy, Mr. Coggins
promised us. . .

13:15.128 --> 13:17.254
But she didn't
mean about that.

to school today.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.676

other children a chance
to catch up, won't it?

persist about this,

14:35.124 --> 14:37.167

simply aren't aware
that your children

were running
about in the road.

it's not a playground.
It's very. . .

just pressing

Yes, just behind you.

to try and exercise
more control over them.

chain them up, couldn't l?

14:55.478 --> 14:56.979
On a nice long chain,
of course,

14:57.063 --> 14:58.397

plenty of exercise.

go to school?

ever play truant?

certainly did not.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.137
And keep it open!

17:37.306 --> 17:38.432
Women!

17:43.563 --> 17:46.982
Confounded woman!
Who does she think she is?

17:47.066 --> 17:50.527
Coming in here
and telling me how
to raise my children.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.238
Do I need somebody
to tell me how
to raise my children?

17:53.489 --> 17:54.740
Do l? Hmm?

17:55.116 --> 17:58.076
No, of course not.
Of course not!

17:59.412 --> 18:00.996
Where's my cardigan?

18:01.205 --> 18:02.372
Under your jacket.

18:02.457 --> 18:03.915
Under. . . Yes.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.835
Self-righteous busybody.

18:07.378 --> 18:08.795
(LAUGHS)

18:08.880 --> 18:09.921
She won't be
bothering us again.

18:10.381 --> 18:11.673
But I liked her.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.885
So did l.
She was very pretty.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.636
She certainly was.

18:18.514 --> 18:22.476
Do you think your
father's a crackpot?

18:22.560 --> 18:24.603
Your cardigan's
inside out.

18:24.687 --> 18:25.979
Oh.

18:26.481 --> 18:27.773
Do you think
I'm a lunatic,

18:27.857 --> 18:29.983
wasting my time on a lot
of silly inventions?

18:30.067 --> 18:32.194
But they aren't silly.
They're wonderful.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.070
Nobody else
could think of them.

18:34.489 --> 18:38.325
That's right. That is right.
Nobody else could
think of them.

18:38.701 --> 18:43.121
Yes. After all,
what makes the battle
worth the fighting?

18:43.956 --> 18:46.041
What makes the mountain
worth the climb?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.335
What makes the questions
worth the asking?

18:49.212 --> 18:50.712
The reason worth
the rhyme?

18:53.049 --> 18:56.468
(SINGING) To me,
the answer's clear

18:57.053 --> 19:00.514
It's having someone near

19:00.890 --> 19:02.974
Someone dear

19:05.645 --> 19:09.564

To be there for

I'll tell you something.
I got up this morning,

22:41.277 --> 22:43.695
and I shot an elephant

How he ever. . .

22:57.793 --> 22:59.419
Now, I wonder how that
could have happened.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.921
Daddy, could we
ask you something?

23:02.006 --> 23:03.048
It's about Mr. Coggins.

23:03.132 --> 23:04.174
Mr. Coggins.

23:04.258 --> 23:06.676
You see, the junkman
wanted to take it away.

23:06.761 --> 23:08.887
But Mr. Coggins says
if we asked you first. . .

23:08.971 --> 23:10.221
Asked me what first?

23:10.306 --> 23:12.015
He's a horrid,
mean, old man.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.141
Mr. Coggins?

23:13.225 --> 23:14.350
No, the junkman.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.477
He's going to
take it away

23:15.561 --> 23:17.687
and put it in a furnace.
And burn it all up.
It's terrible.

23:17.772 --> 23:18.980
What are you
going on about?

23:19.065 --> 23:20.398
BOTH: Our car!

23:20.483 --> 23:21.566
Yes, well, what about it?

23:21.650 --> 23:24.444
Mr. Coggins is selling it
to the junkman.

23:24.528 --> 23:27.489
And the junkman's
going to put it
in the fiery furnace.

23:27.573 --> 23:30.533
And squidge it all up
till there's nothing left.

23:30.618 --> 23:33.161
Oh, well, that's terrible.
That is terrible.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.288
We can't let
that happen, Grandpa.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.166
No, definitely not.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.001
We knew you
wouldn't let them, Daddy.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.545
So we made Mr.

we could have it

23:42.630 --> 23:44.839

Mr. Coggins the money

Yes, Daddy.
Yes, thank you.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.900
Well, I think, maybe,
you should go run up to bed.

Good night, Grandpa.
Good night, my boy.
Sleep tight.

you've done it now,
haven't you?

You think Coggins
might do a deal?
So much a week?

Coggins? What,
him down the road? Sure.

24:26.966 --> 24:30.510

Well, the fundamental
novelty of these

28:51.688 --> 28:54.357
Not only are they
remarkably tasty,

28:54.441 --> 28:57.652
but due to
the unique positioning
of these little holes,

28:57.736 --> 29:00.071
they are capable,
when blown through,

29:00.155 --> 29:02.490
of rendering
a tuneful whistle.

over the holes
and blow thus.

You know,

we could have guessed it.

59:49.336 --> 59:50.336
Oh?

You had to be called

Oh, just tinkering.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.567
Oh.

01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:46.197
You know, Mr. Potts,
you have two
wonderful children.

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:50.242
Why, thank you.
I must agree with you there.

01:03:53.747 --> 01:03:55.664
Isn't it beautiful?

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:59.084
Lovely. Just lovely.

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:05.132
Jeremy, it's not nice
to peek.

01:04:05.217 --> 01:04:07.384
I'm not peeking,
I'm looking.

01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:09.136
Do you think
they like each other?

01:04:09.221 --> 01:04:10.638
Of course they do.

01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:12.264
Do you think they're
going to get married?

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:13.682
Has he kissed her yet?

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:15.059
Not yet.

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:17.144
Well, just as soon as
he kisses her

There aren't any
pirates around here,
are there, Truly?

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:34.703
Oh, I'm sure there are.
Hundreds of them.

01:04:34.955 --> 01:04:36.038
'Course there are.

This is where they
bury their treasure,
isn't it, Daddy?

Mmm-hmm.

Well, let me see.

And he has sailed
all the way to England

01:05:17.956 --> 01:05:21.584
because he has heard tell
of a fantastic motorcar

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:24.837

Caractacus Potts.

immune to them

01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:58.350
And yet

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:04.147
He's such a love

They 21-gun salute me

We're still losing height?

01:27:42.549 --> 01:27:44.759
There must be something else
we can throw out.

01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:47.261
But there's nothing
else we can throw out.

01:27:47.346 --> 01:27:49.263

01:29:10.053 --> 01:29:12.847
Somewhere over
the North Sea, I think.

01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:15.099
Don't you know
where we're going?

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:18.102
No, I don't,
but Chitty does.

01:29:18.979 --> 01:29:21.480

Excuse me, sir.
There seems to be
some sort of mistake.

01:32:15.697 --> 01:32:16.739
What?

01:32:16.823 --> 01:32:19.575

up there.

Children!

01:39:42.602 --> 01:39:44.436
We'd better get
away from here.

01:39:46.648 --> 01:39:49.900
Now, hang on, everybody.
We're coming in to land.

Your Excellency,
it's landing in the village.

the child catcher.

Aren't you clever, Daddy?

01:40:47.375 --> 01:40:49.167
Yes, he certainly is.

01:40:49.752 --> 01:40:52.212
All right. You all stay here.
I'm going up to that castle.

We want to help
you find Grandpa.

we ought to
stay together?

Maybe you're right.
All right, come along.

Haven't they seen
children before?

If the soldiers find them,
they will take them away.

But why? What for?

01:43:04.178 --> 01:43:05.178
It's the law.

Nobody's allowed
to have children
in Vulgaria.

Not allowed?
What about these toys?

01:43:09.851 --> 01:43:11.476
The Baroness,
she hates children.

hate children?

There are children

In the toy shop?
Such a notion.

I mean. . .
What do you think
you're you doing?

01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:56.623
That's something special
for the Baron's birthday.

01:44:56.707 --> 01:45:00.210
Let me tell you, toymaker.

01:45:00.294 --> 01:45:04.839
This nose of mine
has never failed me,

01:45:04.924 --> 01:45:09.844

children here, my friend,

01:45:10.304 --> 01:45:12.639

have your teeth
for a necklace

Fool! ldiot!
Out of my way!

01:45:42.253 --> 01:45:45.755
You have to know
where to look.

01:45:46.298 --> 01:45:50.760
Like cockroaches,
they get under the floors,

01:45:50.845 --> 01:45:56.224
in the cracks in the walls,
in the woodwork.

01:46:34.764 --> 01:46:38.808
I don't trust
a man who makes toys

01:46:38.893 --> 01:46:43.646

children are forbidden.

is exclusively for his

Chitty away.

going to do?

Well, I don't know,
but I'm not just
gonna stand here.

01:47:25.648 --> 01:47:27.023
Are you mad?

01:47:27.108 --> 01:47:29.859
Are you going to take on
the whole Vulgarian Army
single-handed?

a country is this?
No children!

take some good advice.

Take your children
and your good lady
and get out of Vulgaria.

01:47:51.841 --> 01:47:53.967
And leave Grandpa
up in the castle?

01:47:54.051 --> 01:47:56.553
Oh, no.
We came to get him out,
that's what we're gonna do.

01:47:56.637 --> 01:47:57.971
Just tell me
how to get there.

finish this in time

I just got home. . .
This is beginning to be. . .

02:21:47.499 --> 02:21:48.666
. . .and your father
was at my house.
. . .a hazard.

02:21:48.750 --> 02:21:50.626
I know! I know!
They told me at the house.

02:21:50.711 --> 02:21:52.253
We're rich.
(EXCLAIMS)

02:21:53.046 --> 02:21:55.840
You know, more than that,
I have succeeded.

02:21:55.924 --> 02:21:57.884
I always knew you would.

02:21:58.927 --> 02:22:01.888
You know something else?
The kids were right.

02:22:01.972 --> 02:22:04.640
There's nothing so ridiculous
about the idea of
getting married.

02:22:04.725 --> 02:22:06.934
Well, whoever said
there was?

02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:16.944
Well, Mr. Potts.

02:22:17.029 --> 02:22:18.112
What's the matter?

02:22:18.197 --> 02:22:20.281
Now you'll have to
marry me.

02:22:20.365 --> 02:22:21.699
(BOTH LAUGHING)

02:22:25.621 --> 02:22:27.622
So dreams can come true.

02:22:27.706 --> 02:22:28.956
Yes, they can.

02:22:29.041 --> 02:22:32.001
Yes, they can,
but you have to
be practical, too.

02:22:32.836 --> 02:22:34.962
You have to face the facts.

02:22:35.756 --> 02:22:38.132
Man has to see things
as they really are.

02:22:38.217 --> 02:22:40.384
After all,
a man with responsibilities

02:22:40.469 --> 02:22:43.554
can't walk around
with his head in the clouds
all the time.

02:22:43.639 --> 02:22:46.974
A man should keep his feet
solidly on the ground.

02:22:47.059 --> 02:22:49.727
Oh, a man should have
his dreams

02:22:49.811 --> 02:22:53.606
but a man has to learn
to put those dreams
to some practical use,

02:22:53.690 --> 02:22:57.401
not just sit around
and think about them
all the time.

02:23:05.118 --> 02:23:07.245
BOTH: (SINGING) Oh, you,
pretty Chitty Bang Bang

02:23:07.329 --> 02:23:09.288
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
we love you

02:23:09.373 --> 02:23:11.415
And our pretty

02:23:11.500 --> 02:23:13.376
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
loves us too

02:23:13.460 --> 02:23:15.294
High, low, anywhere we go

02:23:15.379 --> 02:23:17.630
On Chitty Chitty we depend

02:23:17.714 --> 02:23:19.423
Bang Bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

02:23:19.508 --> 02:23:21.759

02:23:21.843 --> 02:23:23.594
Bang Bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

02:23:23.679 --> 02:23:26.055
Our fine four-fendered friend

02:23:28.558 --> 02:23:30.935
CARACTACUS:
It's uncategorical

02:23:31.019 --> 02:23:32.937
A fuel-burning oracle

02:23:33.021 --> 02:23:36.816
A phantasmagorical machine

02:23:37.234 --> 02:23:39.235
TRULY: It's more
than spectacular

02:23:39.319 --> 02:23:41.279
To use the vernacular

02:23:41.363 --> 02:23:43.406
It's wizard
It's smashing

02:23:43.490 --> 02:23:47.076
BOTH: It's keen

02:23:47.744 --> 02:23:49.829
Oh, Chitty, you Chitty
Pretty Chitty Bang Bang

02:23:49.913 --> 02:23:51.872
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
we love you

02:23:51.957 --> 02:23:54.041
And Chitty, in Chitty
Pretty Chitty Bang Bang

02:23:54.126 --> 02:23:56.085
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
what we'll do

02:23:56.169 --> 02:23:58.004
Near, Chitty, far, Chitty,
in our motorcar

02:23:58.088 --> 02:24:00.131
Oh, what a happy time
we'll spend

02:24:00.215 --> 02:24:02.008
Bang Bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

02:24:02.092 --> 02:24:04.385
Our fine four-fendered friend

02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:06.220
Bang Bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

02:24:06.305 --> 02:24:08.639
Our fine four-fendered friend

02:24:08.724 --> 02:24:10.599
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

02:24:10.684 --> 02:24:12.435
Fine four-fendered
