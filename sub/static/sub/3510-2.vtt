WEBVTT

00:02.976 --> 00:04.535
Come on, baby. Where you going?

00:05.944 --> 00:07.428
Hey, the party's just
getting started.

00:07.512 --> 00:10.024
Help! Somebody help me!

00:10.095 --> 00:11.796
Hey, come here.

00:12.835 --> 00:14.411
Get off me, you son of a bitch!

00:14.505 --> 00:17.051
Oh-ho. Shh.
I'll teach you to run from me.

00:17.144 --> 00:18.868
Leave the girl alone.

00:19.464 --> 00:22.483
Why don't you get lost
before I take you down?

00:29.339 --> 00:33.202
Mother, prepare to feast on the
finest omelet in the land.

00:33.339 --> 00:35.289
Before you join the convent.

00:35.387 --> 00:38.399
No, I am making costumes
for my Shakespeare class.

00:38.476 --> 00:41.263
- So... what do you think?
- I seem to remember

00:41.345 --> 00:43.527
asking you to make me an
ET Halloween costume

00:43.599 --> 00:45.075
and you told me you
didn't know how to sew.

00:45.138 --> 00:47.601
Details.
Besides, you were 32 at the time.

00:47.684 --> 00:49.634
The point is, proper wardrobe

00:49.701 --> 00:52.537
helps an actor connect
to the words.

00:52.605 --> 00:54.194
So Lady MacBeth, I presume?

00:54.259 --> 00:55.448
Desdemona.

00:55.508 --> 00:57.598
Oh, Desdemona.

00:57.667 --> 00:58.873
Yeah, me, too.

00:58.936 --> 01:01.085
No, you hang up first.

01:01.142 --> 01:02.357
No, you.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.579
It's your turn.

01:04.542 --> 01:07.034
Stanford sounds so amazing.

01:07.428 --> 01:08.695
I can't wait for January.

01:08.822 --> 01:10.462
- January?
- When I leave...

01:10.535 --> 01:11.956
- for Stanford.
- What?

01:12.025 --> 01:13.902
Alexis applied for
spring admission.

01:13.975 --> 01:14.965
You remember.

01:15.024 --> 01:17.022
Yeah, I just thought--
well, you haven't

01:17.084 --> 01:18.472
talked about it for a
long time, so I thought--

01:18.538 --> 01:21.017
because every time I did, I
saw the look on your face.

01:21.096 --> 01:22.794
That look right there.

01:22.854 --> 01:25.933
Oh, no, honey, it's just that
Stanford is a big decision.

01:26.012 --> 01:28.157
I mean, you sh-- you
should think it over.

01:28.230 --> 01:29.920
I did, and there's no downside.

01:29.975 --> 01:31.879
It's a great university.
Ashley is there.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.895
I mean, I'll have enough
credits to graduate early.

01:33.969 --> 01:34.776
Yeah, but don't you wanna...

01:34.839 --> 01:36.278
you know, finish
off senior year...

01:36.332 --> 01:38.782
with your friends,
right, and prom?

01:38.859 --> 01:39.973
Don't you want to go to prom?

01:40.042 --> 01:41.682
Yeah. Uh, Ashley just
gave me his password

01:41.750 --> 01:43.538
so I can go check out
his classes online.

01:45.623 --> 01:47.532
Lady Beckett, milord.

01:48.743 --> 01:49.843
Richard, are you crying?

01:49.915 --> 01:50.833
No, it's the onions.

01:50.917 --> 01:53.826
Okay, I'll admit, it wasn't just the onions.
Not completely.

01:53.890 --> 01:56.289
I mean, she's gonna be
gone in a few months.

01:56.358 --> 01:57.071
My little girl.

01:57.142 --> 01:58.462
Yeah, but she's
growing up, Castle,

01:58.527 --> 02:00.769
and she's going to
a great school.

02:00.841 --> 02:01.854
That's what you want, isn't it?

02:01.916 --> 02:03.374
Yes, I'm just not ready.

02:03.428 --> 02:05.434
Okay, well, she is,
so you two are just

02:05.513 --> 02:06.651
not on the same page.

02:06.726 --> 02:08.842
- So what do I do?
- Let her go.

02:09.282 --> 02:10.036
Trust me,

02:10.109 --> 02:11.942
if you hold on too tight,
you'll just drive her away.

02:12.020 --> 02:14.368
Detective, detective, detective,

02:14.416 --> 02:15.824
what can you tell us
about this homicide?

02:15.888 --> 02:17.809
Uh, no comment. Excuse me.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.286
For a murder in an alley, really?

02:21.345 --> 02:23.533
Officer Hastings,
what's this all about?

02:23.655 --> 02:25.677
You should see for
yourself, detective.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.746
Oh! Yeah, tell me about it.

02:31.832 --> 02:33.152
Uh, so he was...

02:33.226 --> 02:35.435
Split right down the middle,
from the top of his head

02:35.486 --> 02:37.344
all the way down to his--

02:37.410 --> 02:39.099
Please.
The guy was sliced in two.

02:39.162 --> 02:41.620
I'd say his unit is the
least of his problems.

02:41.688 --> 02:43.283
Then you do not understand
the sacred bond

02:43.347 --> 02:44.343
between a man and his unit.

02:44.401 --> 02:46.552
Okay, so what was the
murder weapon, guillotine?

02:46.601 --> 02:47.767
A sword.

02:47.827 --> 02:49.654
The tip broke off in the body.

02:49.720 --> 02:50.620
Blood spatter indicates

02:50.689 --> 02:52.770
that the killer first lopped
off the victim's hand,

02:52.838 --> 02:54.411
then took the big swing.

02:54.564 --> 02:57.221
A single-edged blade,
some kind of saber?

02:58.092 --> 03:00.458
Man, a sword.
That is so "Game of Thrones."

03:00.527 --> 03:01.515
Esposito, this looks like

03:01.590 --> 03:02.746
it might have been
a ritual killing,

03:02.815 --> 03:04.583
so let's get photos
of all the bystanders

03:04.661 --> 03:06.393
- in case the killer came back.
- On it.

03:06.461 --> 03:08.739
Meanwhile, the Vic's
name is Tyler Faris.

03:08.797 --> 03:11.139
He just got out of Sing Sing a
year ago for sexual assault.

03:11.208 --> 03:12.402
Okay, we got any witnesses?

03:12.470 --> 03:14.552
Yeah, the girl he was in
the middle of assaulting,

03:14.611 --> 03:15.992
a Marie Marcado.

03:17.297 --> 03:19.721
I met him last night at
Matt's bar around the corner.

03:19.784 --> 03:21.306
He seemed like a nice enough guy,

03:21.379 --> 03:23.402
talking all big about
his ship coming in.

03:23.594 --> 03:25.846
Anyway... it got late.

03:26.610 --> 03:27.969
I left with him.

03:28.078 --> 03:30.214
But that's when he started
getting all super aggressive.

03:30.279 --> 03:32.195
I took off running. He caught me.

03:32.558 --> 03:34.475
I mean, God knows what
he would've done if--

03:34.558 --> 03:36.725
If Conan the Barbarian
hadn't shown up?

03:37.855 --> 03:39.621
What did the killer look like?

03:39.708 --> 03:41.980
It was so dark, I didn't
really get to see his face.

03:42.666 --> 03:43.778
You didn't catch anything--

03:43.850 --> 03:46.616
ethnicity, age, weight, height?

03:50.636 --> 03:52.136
She's holding out on us.

03:52.208 --> 03:53.655
Well, Conan probably
saved her life.

03:53.724 --> 03:54.967
She doesn't want to
throw him under the bus

03:55.035 --> 03:57.322
or under a Ben-Hur-style chariot.

03:57.381 --> 04:00.229
Yeah, but she saw the killer.
Isn't she afraid for her life?

04:00.289 --> 04:02.313
She probably knows
he wasn't after her.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.246
A career felon smited in two?

04:05.408 --> 04:06.906
That's very old testament.

04:06.971 --> 04:09.198
This--this plays like
a vigilante killing.

04:09.253 --> 04:10.852
Think dirty Harry with a sword.

04:10.906 --> 04:12.220
Who just happens
to be in the alley

04:12.293 --> 04:13.973
when Faris is
committing a felony?

04:14.437 --> 04:16.366
That timing is a
little suspicious.

04:16.427 --> 04:18.523
The killer probably
followed him from the bar.

04:18.572 --> 04:19.442
With a sword?

04:20.067 --> 04:21.082
Touche.

04:21.902 --> 04:23.434
Let's talk to the next of kin.

04:24.839 --> 04:27.361
Mrs. Faris, we're very
sorry for your loss.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.664
Don't sweat it.

04:32.771 --> 04:33.734
Pardon me?

04:34.606 --> 04:36.028
These things can happen.

04:36.096 --> 04:37.996
Not in this century, they don't.

04:38.120 --> 04:39.409
Don't get me wrong,

04:39.469 --> 04:42.447
I never expected my boy
to end up in two hunks.

04:42.508 --> 04:43.809
But I always knew, one day,

04:43.888 --> 04:46.105
he'd end up there,
laying on a slab.

04:46.174 --> 04:47.403
And why is that?

04:47.455 --> 04:49.594
Because Tyler was
a no-good loser.

04:49.661 --> 04:52.793
He made one dumbass
mistake after the next.

04:52.916 --> 04:55.374
I see. Um, do you know
if he was involved

04:55.421 --> 04:57.460
in anything that might
have gotten him killed?

04:57.508 --> 04:59.328
Oh, I certainly expect so.

05:00.402 --> 05:02.238
He told someone that his
ship was coming in.

05:02.287 --> 05:03.287
What does that mean?

05:03.334 --> 05:04.891
His ship was always coming in.

05:04.931 --> 05:07.198
That was Tyler, always
working an angle.

05:07.258 --> 05:08.884
Ma'am, um, I'll need the names

05:08.946 --> 05:10.737
of all the enemies
your son may have had.

05:11.357 --> 05:13.178
You're gonna need a bigger pad.

05:14.941 --> 05:16.628
Larceny, assault, fraud--

05:16.681 --> 05:18.155
you name it, Tyler
Faris has done it.

05:18.215 --> 05:20.401
Still, nobody deserves
ending up like... that.

05:20.480 --> 05:21.685
He got what was coming to him.

05:21.753 --> 05:24.153
Dude, that's for the criminal
justice system to decide.

05:24.221 --> 05:26.002
Well, maybe a sword
is a justice system.

05:26.061 --> 05:27.673
Yeah, if you're Quentin
Tarantino, maybe.

05:27.731 --> 05:29.746
He made lots of calls to an
untraceable burner phone

05:29.815 --> 05:31.129
in the past six months.

05:31.188 --> 05:33.467
Behavior consistent with
a criminal dirtbag.

05:33.522 --> 05:34.643
Check this out.

05:34.691 --> 05:36.256
Tyler Faris got
into an altercation

05:36.306 --> 05:38.062
at a bodega three days ago.

05:38.118 --> 05:40.098
He was gone by the time
the cops showed up,

05:40.176 --> 05:42.213
but the shopkeeper says
that he was fighting

05:42.282 --> 05:44.063
with some other guy over money.

05:44.130 --> 05:46.082
- Does the other guy have a name?
- Yeah.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.838
Tony Valtini.
This guy's got a record, too.

05:48.912 --> 05:50.300
Damn right, he does.

05:50.359 --> 05:52.380
I remember Valtini from
back in narcotics.

05:52.455 --> 05:54.326
The guy is totally mobbed up.

05:54.983 --> 05:56.322
You know what else?

05:56.405 --> 05:58.303
His family owns this
meatpacking plant

05:58.363 --> 05:59.297
out in Jersey.

05:59.371 --> 06:02.455
Tony's nickname--
"Tony the butcher."

06:02.743 --> 06:05.181
I bet he split a few sides
of beef in his day.

06:05.255 --> 06:07.489
Yeah, I had words with Faris.

06:07.548 --> 06:09.840
He used to work for me at
Tony Valtini enterprises.

06:09.915 --> 06:11.526
Which division, drug sales

06:11.624 --> 06:13.774
or distribution of
stolen property?

06:13.833 --> 06:16.689
I am a legitimate businessman.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.767
Faris sucked at his
job, so I canned him.

06:18.823 --> 06:20.692
He thought I owed him back pay.

06:20.829 --> 06:23.428
We settled it like gentlemen.

06:24.415 --> 06:25.914
You don't believe me, go ask him.

06:25.982 --> 06:27.586
We'd have to hold a seance.

06:29.150 --> 06:30.295
He's dead?

06:30.362 --> 06:32.474
Let's just say, Tyler Faris

06:32.564 --> 06:34.870
is half the man he used to be.

06:35.647 --> 06:36.727
A man divided?

06:37.091 --> 06:38.623
Split personality?

06:39.309 --> 06:40.503
Really, nothing?

06:40.600 --> 06:42.713
He was cleaved in two

06:42.812 --> 06:43.885
with a sword.

06:44.534 --> 06:45.697
A sword?

06:45.776 --> 06:49.232
Much like the long knives
used at a meatpacking plant.

06:50.926 --> 06:53.362
Oh, hey, it wasn't me.
I had nothing to do with it.

06:53.426 --> 06:55.530
But I know who did.

06:56.404 --> 06:57.735
It was that guy...

06:57.797 --> 06:59.964
That nut job vigilante
who attacked me.

07:00.034 --> 07:01.924
You never reported an attack.

07:02.171 --> 07:04.356
I don't like to be a
burden on law enforcement.

07:04.414 --> 07:07.586
Bottom line is, I'm leaving
my warehouse one night...

07:07.895 --> 07:09.051
Three weeks ago.

07:09.283 --> 07:11.274
All of a sudden, here comes
this guy with a sword.

07:11.357 --> 07:13.509
He accuses me of
criminal conduct,

07:13.603 --> 07:15.493
unjustly, by the way,

07:15.568 --> 07:16.709
then he threatens to kill me

07:16.773 --> 07:18.645
if I don't leave town, and then...

07:19.279 --> 07:20.889
you know what he does then?

07:21.856 --> 07:23.363
What does he do then?

07:23.451 --> 07:24.181
He...

07:24.244 --> 07:26.733
Cuts me. Look at this.

07:28.316 --> 07:29.210
You see that?

07:29.264 --> 07:31.655
- See that scar there?
- Looks like an "l".

07:31.719 --> 07:33.735
Mr. Valtini, could you please
put your pants back up?

07:33.798 --> 07:35.318
He did that to me!

07:35.380 --> 07:38.173
He did that, with
his sword, to me.

07:38.239 --> 07:39.127
Okay?

07:41.600 --> 07:42.857
What did this man look like?

07:42.925 --> 07:45.384
You wouldn't even believe
me if I told you. Okay?

07:45.458 --> 07:46.717
But...

07:46.802 --> 07:48.471
I got cameras in my warehouse.

07:49.087 --> 07:52.358
When he ran off, I
caught him on video.

07:57.321 --> 07:59.061
The time code lines
up with the night

07:59.129 --> 08:00.601
that Valtini said
he was attacked.

08:00.670 --> 08:02.238
And according to E.R. records,

08:02.310 --> 08:04.829
he was admitted that night--
knife wounds to the buttocks.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.586
The sword of justice, bro.

08:10.017 --> 08:11.005
Wait, is that...

08:12.082 --> 08:12.847
No.

08:13.430 --> 08:14.573
It can't be.

08:18.912 --> 08:19.854
It is.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.082
Our killer is a superhero.

08:24.585 --> 08:29.819
Sync by YYeTs, Corrections by Alex1969
www.addic7ed.com

08:33.005 --> 08:33.892
Really?

08:33.976 --> 08:35.046
A superhero?

08:35.109 --> 08:36.994
Yeah, our witness from
the alley confirms

08:37.044 --> 08:39.522
that she saw this man
kill Tyler Faris.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.160
Well, why didn't she
say that before?

08:41.208 --> 08:42.889
She didn't think that
we'd believe her.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.623
And quite frankly, she's right.

08:44.672 --> 08:46.395
A masked vigilante on the loose,

08:46.458 --> 08:47.670
hacking people up?

08:47.734 --> 08:49.960
Tell me what your plan is to
apprehend this individual.

08:50.019 --> 08:52.448
We're, uh, we're looking for
murders with the same M.O.,

08:52.508 --> 08:54.470
we're also checking into
enemies that Tyler Faris

08:54.528 --> 08:56.271
and Tony Valtini might
have had in common,

08:56.321 --> 08:57.643
and finally, we're
trying to track down

08:57.696 --> 08:59.499
where that suit and
sword came from.

08:59.551 --> 09:00.399
Reach out to Bellevue.

09:00.454 --> 09:02.520
They probably admitted
our suspect before.

09:02.588 --> 09:05.169
He's clearly delusional
or a psychotic.

09:05.231 --> 09:06.177
Yes, sir.

09:06.624 --> 09:07.982
Keep me apprised, detective.

09:08.046 --> 09:08.680
Yes.

09:10.190 --> 09:11.832
Don't waste your
time on Bellevue.

09:12.182 --> 09:13.612
You were eavesdropping?

09:13.729 --> 09:15.264
Can I help it if I
have superhuman,

09:15.323 --> 09:16.597
daredevil-like hearing?

09:16.662 --> 09:18.387
Our killer is not crazy.

09:18.457 --> 09:19.887
He cut a man in two

09:19.966 --> 09:22.279
and he's running around
wearing a superhero suit.

09:22.337 --> 09:25.461
I know costumes.
That one is not commercial.

09:25.521 --> 09:26.702
He probably designed it himself,

09:26.762 --> 09:28.081
which means he's
highly functional.

09:28.133 --> 09:29.139
You know what I would
love right now?

09:29.198 --> 09:31.072
Is if somebody would come
here and give me a theory

09:31.130 --> 09:33.290
that would actually help
me solve this case.

09:33.348 --> 09:34.437
I've got one.

09:34.498 --> 09:37.429
Every superhero has a
persona, a mission,

09:37.497 --> 09:38.979
an origin story.

09:39.043 --> 09:42.320
Learning who he is as a
hero, what drives him,

09:42.385 --> 09:44.220
that will lead us to the
man behind the mask.

09:44.270 --> 09:46.518
Castle, what good is
comic book mythology

09:46.586 --> 09:48.726
when our killer is
not a superhero?

09:48.785 --> 09:49.877
What if he is a superhero?

09:50.190 --> 09:52.918
Like this one, who
operates out of Queens.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.355
Meet... the Red Marune.

09:55.438 --> 09:57.484
Red Marune? Isn't that redundant?

09:57.745 --> 09:58.685
Don't worry, ma'am.

09:58.735 --> 10:01.305
Red Marune, protector of
all, beholding to none.

10:04.153 --> 10:06.984
Sir, this is clearly
not your purse.

10:07.045 --> 10:08.867
I demand that you unhand it.

10:11.639 --> 10:12.652
Ma'am, are--are you all right?

10:14.415 --> 10:16.472
Wow. Impressive
crime-fighting skills.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.752
What do you think, mutant
powers or years of training?

10:18.806 --> 10:20.458
Yes, well, sometimes,
the runner stumbles.

10:20.517 --> 10:22.518
The point is, there
is a subculture

10:22.587 --> 10:25.553
of real-life superheroes that
actually exists out there.

10:25.611 --> 10:27.942
People crusading for
the public good.

10:27.988 --> 10:29.788
Yes, and usually, they
get their asses kicked,

10:29.842 --> 10:30.707
just like this guy.

10:30.769 --> 10:32.038
I think our vigilante
is one of them.

10:32.096 --> 10:33.573
Castle, if he's a crusader
for the public good,

10:33.633 --> 10:36.840
- then why did he partition Tyler Faris?
- Ah, because tragically...

10:36.901 --> 10:37.839
His pursuit of justice

10:37.892 --> 10:40.384
has led him down the
path of the dark side.

10:40.448 --> 10:41.947
That is a fate that has befallen

10:42.004 --> 10:43.247
many a hero.

10:44.025 --> 10:44.957
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.179
Trust me,

10:46.533 --> 10:49.100
I am onto something with
this superhero angle.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.090
My spidey senses are tingling.

10:52.401 --> 10:53.156
What's with him?

10:53.235 --> 10:55.447
Something about spidey
senses and tingling.

10:56.115 --> 10:57.109
Photos from the alley?

10:57.184 --> 10:59.055
We may have a suspect.
Tech says that that guy

10:59.104 --> 11:01.470
matches the height and build
of the guy in the suit.

11:01.472 --> 11:03.228
Not only that, when he saw the
cops taking his pictures,

11:03.229 --> 11:03.907
he ran.

11:03.908 --> 11:05.959
All right, have uniforms
circulate his photo.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.694
- I want to know his name.
- All right.

11:08.962 --> 11:09.917
You know,

11:09.924 --> 11:12.442
Castle might be right about
this guy being a superhero.

11:12.443 --> 11:14.579
I talked to a buddy
of mine in narcotics.

11:14.580 --> 11:16.555
He said he heard rumors
about a guy on the streets

11:16.556 --> 11:19.377
rousting drug dealers and
dumping their stashes--

11:19.378 --> 11:21.084
a masked man with a sword.

11:21.085 --> 11:22.972
Yes, it is a samurai sword.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.239
So we're checking
specialty stores

11:24.240 --> 11:25.778
and martial arts suppliers.

11:25.779 --> 11:27.430
And what about the costume?

11:27.431 --> 11:29.799
Not available in any stores,

11:29.861 --> 11:30.807
just like Castle said.

11:30.808 --> 11:32.317
Speaking of costumes...

11:32.318 --> 11:34.657
I know who the killer is.

11:34.845 --> 11:38.014
Behold--a photo of
our masked vigilante

11:38.015 --> 11:41.797
juxtaposed with issues from
my own marvel collection.

11:41.798 --> 11:43.040
You have "Avengers" number 1?

11:43.041 --> 11:44.506
And there's more where
that came from.

11:44.507 --> 11:46.652
You're welcome to peruse
my issues anytime.

11:46.653 --> 11:48.159
Please note how the killer

11:48.160 --> 11:50.446
has drawn inspiration
from costumes

11:50.447 --> 11:52.747
of other superheroes,
for example,

11:52.748 --> 11:55.879
the color scheme
evokes Spider-Man,

11:55.880 --> 11:59.666
the horned helmet--obviously
an homage to Daredevil,

11:59.667 --> 12:01.571
the sword and
scabbard-- Deadpool,

12:01.572 --> 12:04.058
a high collar, just
like Black Panther.

12:04.059 --> 12:07.248
Now what do these characters
all have in common?

12:07.249 --> 12:08.610
They're make-believe?

12:08.611 --> 12:11.307
They're driven by the death of
a father figure or loved one.

12:11.308 --> 12:12.722
Exactly.

12:12.975 --> 12:16.329
I believe that our killer
shares a similar backstory,

12:16.330 --> 12:17.903
which is why he's been inspired

12:17.904 --> 12:20.184
by these characters' costumes.

12:20.185 --> 12:22.359
Furthermore, out of costumes,

12:22.678 --> 12:24.448
these heroes tend
to be unassuming,

12:24.449 --> 12:26.715
so let's add mild-mannered
to our profile.

12:26.716 --> 12:27.637
Mr. Castle,

12:27.638 --> 12:29.695
so this is you
working a homicide?

12:29.696 --> 12:31.811
A superhero who's mild-mannered,

12:31.812 --> 12:33.769
and someone killed his parents?

12:33.930 --> 12:35.475
Isn't that all of them?

12:35.527 --> 12:39.613
How can any of this produce
even one useful conclusion?

12:39.974 --> 12:42.532
Let me direct your attention
to the golden belt

12:42.533 --> 12:45.126
worn by our masked vigilante,

12:45.410 --> 12:47.662
based on the golden
belt worn by Iron Man

12:47.663 --> 12:51.544
in only 11 original
issues in 1963.

12:52.088 --> 12:53.695
Which proves what, exactly?

12:53.696 --> 12:55.289
Our killer collected comic books,

12:55.290 --> 12:57.645
which means there is
one place in this city

12:57.646 --> 12:59.743
he would definitely go.

13:00.924 --> 13:01.481
You know, Castle,

13:01.482 --> 13:03.603
you might want to tone
down the theories

13:03.604 --> 13:05.323
until gates warms up to you.

13:05.324 --> 13:07.363
Oh, I plan to melt
Captain Permafrost

13:07.364 --> 13:08.668
by solving this case.

13:08.669 --> 13:10.720
Yeah, well, good
luck with that one.

13:10.721 --> 13:11.656
Whoa.

13:13.255 --> 13:14.234
You smell that?

13:15.212 --> 13:17.131
Wafting scent of printed pages?

13:17.132 --> 13:18.865
Comicadia beckons.

13:18.866 --> 13:22.051
This place is the premier
comic book shop.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.646
It's the Vatican to a Catholic.

13:23.647 --> 13:26.034
It's Mecca to a pilgrim.
It's upstream to a spawning--

13:26.035 --> 13:26.831
I know, Castle.

13:26.832 --> 13:29.300
I bought my first comic
here when I was 14.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.279
"Sin City: A dame to kill for."

13:31.280 --> 13:33.338
Hard-core!
Okay, wait, wait, okay.

13:33.339 --> 13:35.422
If you could be any comic
book character in the world,

13:35.423 --> 13:36.670
who would you be?

13:36.919 --> 13:37.878
Elektra.

13:37.879 --> 13:40.860
Ah, a ruthless assassin who
hides from her emotions.

13:40.861 --> 13:44.150
No, maybe it's because she's
got badass ninja skills.

13:44.768 --> 13:47.541
What about you?
Iron Man? Spider-Man?

13:47.542 --> 13:49.552
No, wait. I know. Annoying man.

13:49.989 --> 13:51.518
Try billionaire
industrialist Bruce Wayne,

13:51.519 --> 13:52.752
a.k.a. the Dark Knight.

13:52.753 --> 13:54.278
He's brooding, he's handsome,

13:54.279 --> 13:56.686
and he has all the coolest toys.

13:56.944 --> 13:58.678
Wow. Digging deep on that one.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.331
And did I mention
what discerning taste

14:03.332 --> 14:05.635
they have here at Comicadia?

14:06.442 --> 14:07.507
Oh, Mr. Castle.

14:07.741 --> 14:09.765
- A-and you're Kate Beckett, right?
- Mm-hmm.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.745
Oh. Mike Hoover.
Sir, I am a huge fan.

14:11.746 --> 14:13.133
It is such an honor to meet you.

14:13.134 --> 14:14.233
Oh, the honor's mine.

14:14.234 --> 14:16.195
We just got your Derrick
Storm graphic novel.

14:16.196 --> 14:17.453
I mean, the art, the writing--

14:17.454 --> 14:19.708
it is, in a word, awesome.

14:19.709 --> 14:21.009
Tell me, what's
your favorite part?

14:21.010 --> 14:22.467
You don't have to
answer that question.

14:22.468 --> 14:24.131
His ego does not need
any more feeding.

14:24.132 --> 14:26.480
Definitely where Derrick Storm
escapes from the two bad guys

14:26.481 --> 14:27.914
- by crashing the taxi cab.
- Taxi cab.

14:27.915 --> 14:30.353
Oh. I'm sorry, detective Beckett.

14:30.354 --> 14:31.566
I should've said spoiler alert.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.378
Oh, no. That's okay.
I won't be reading it.

14:33.379 --> 14:35.551
Really?
I saw your name on our list.

14:35.552 --> 14:36.805
You preordered a copy.

14:36.806 --> 14:37.958
Did she now?

14:38.223 --> 14:39.797
I was just being supportive.

14:39.906 --> 14:40.999
Anyway, we're not
here about that.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.306
We need to ask you a few questions.
Yes, we do.

14:43.307 --> 14:45.891
I don't suppose you know of any
collectors of early Iron Man.

14:45.892 --> 14:47.261
I'm sorry, Mr. Castle.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.673
I-I can't share
customer information.

14:49.674 --> 14:51.476
Mike, do you recognize this man?

14:52.182 --> 14:54.914
Uh, no. He doesn't look familiar.

14:55.134 --> 14:56.149
What about...

14:56.712 --> 14:57.877
This one?

14:58.487 --> 14:59.620
Yeah, him I know.

14:59.878 --> 15:00.995
- You do?
- Yeah.

15:01.245 --> 15:03.018
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:08.195 --> 15:11.127
The sword, the suit--
that's our vigilante.

15:11.128 --> 15:12.379
Lone Vengeance,

15:12.380 --> 15:15.641
that explains the "l" he carved
into Tony Valtini's backside,

15:15.642 --> 15:17.476
but "Sword of Lone Vengeance,"
how come I've never seen this?

15:17.477 --> 15:18.646
Oh, it's online only.

15:18.647 --> 15:20.329
It's kind of fringe, but
it has a following.

15:20.330 --> 15:21.912
A guy named Sean Elt writes it.

15:21.913 --> 15:22.622
Looks like you put more thought

15:22.623 --> 15:25.112
into the killer's costume
than he did, Castle.

15:25.113 --> 15:27.340
It's a direct copy out
of the comic book.

15:27.942 --> 15:29.131
I've seen that before.

15:29.132 --> 15:30.564
The knuckle plates, where?

15:30.565 --> 15:31.676
On the ground at the crime scene.

15:31.677 --> 15:33.533
I thought it was a
button, but this is it.

15:33.534 --> 15:35.792
That's what it was.
It fell off of his suit.

15:35.793 --> 15:36.877
If we can find that,

15:36.878 --> 15:39.470
if it's still there, it could
lead us to the killer.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.690
Uniforms widened their canvass.

15:41.691 --> 15:44.043
Still can't find anyone who
knows our mystery man.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.473
Yeah, well, whoever he
is, I can't connect him

15:45.474 --> 15:46.840
to any swords either.

15:46.841 --> 15:48.283
I pray we nail this dude

15:48.284 --> 15:50.032
before I have to call
every store on that list.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.408
Thought you were kind of
rooting for this guy.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.523
That's when he was Joe Citizen
taking it to the bad guys.

15:53.524 --> 15:54.915
Now he's just some
nimrod in a suit.

15:54.916 --> 15:57.302
Mm. You gotta give him props
for spirit, though, right?

15:57.303 --> 15:59.348
I mean, haven't you ever
wanted to be a superhero?

15:59.368 --> 16:01.500
Going out there,
prowling the city,

16:01.501 --> 16:02.734
knocking some heads?

16:02.735 --> 16:05.095
I do that now.
Yeah, I'm still here.

16:06.322 --> 16:07.271
You did?

16:08.051 --> 16:08.967
When?

16:09.057 --> 16:10.087
I'll be right there.

16:11.274 --> 16:12.915
Jake's pawnshop sold
a samurai sword

16:12.916 --> 16:14.260
to some guy two hours ago.

16:14.261 --> 16:16.472
They say he matches our
photo of our mystery man.

16:16.473 --> 16:19.117
Maybe he's replacing the one
he broke off in Tyler Faris.

16:22.072 --> 16:24.050
It was... here.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.401
I know it was here.

16:25.402 --> 16:26.408
Well, maybe somebody
picked it up.

16:26.409 --> 16:28.510
Or maybe it was a button.

16:28.594 --> 16:30.892
No, it's--ah. Aha.

16:31.697 --> 16:33.006
There it is.

16:33.432 --> 16:35.855
That is no button.

16:36.289 --> 16:38.667
That is a piece of his costume.

16:39.751 --> 16:40.589
You're right.

16:40.590 --> 16:43.167
Castle, I think there's
a partial print on it.

16:43.374 --> 16:44.615
Aah! Whoa!

16:46.000 --> 16:52.074

16:55.359 --> 16:56.200
Police!

16:56.201 --> 16:57.329
Stop!

17:01.382 --> 17:02.799
How cool was that?!

17:02.893 --> 17:04.976
Which part, that that
was our murderer

17:04.977 --> 17:06.511
or that he just got away?

17:07.999 --> 17:09.461
I gotta call in an APB.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.327
Espo, I gotta call you back.

17:13.328 --> 17:15.012
Whoa, whoa, wait.
You're gonna want to hear this.

17:15.012 --> 17:16.345
Yeah, we just saw our suspect.

17:16.346 --> 17:17.717
- He fled the crime scene.
- Yeah,

17:17.718 --> 17:20.516
and I know where to find him
because I know who he is.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.935
What? How?

17:21.952 --> 17:23.242
Well, he bought a samurai sword

17:23.243 --> 17:25.970
at a pawnshop today,
and now get this--

17:25.971 --> 17:27.367
he paid for it with a check.

17:27.368 --> 17:28.625
His name is, uh,

17:28.812 --> 17:29.847
Chad Hockney.

17:29.848 --> 17:31.035
His photo matches the mystery man

17:31.036 --> 17:32.039
from the crime scene.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.281
What's his address?

17:38.287 --> 17:40.425
NYPD. Do not move a muscle.

17:40.428 --> 17:42.899
Unless you can move faster
than a speeding bullet.

17:51.612 --> 17:52.585
This man...

17:53.001 --> 17:54.317
He's our killer?

17:54.564 --> 17:55.855
Well, to be fair, h--

17:55.856 --> 17:58.489
he was a lot more imposing
in a dark alley...

17:59.107 --> 18:00.215
with a sword.

18:00.910 --> 18:03.531
Yeah, he lives four blocks
away from the crime scene,

18:04.135 --> 18:06.918
and CSU's going through his
apartment right now to find...

18:06.919 --> 18:09.719
e-evidence to link
him to the murder.

18:10.656 --> 18:12.645
Tie this up in a bow, detective.

18:12.982 --> 18:14.532
Get me a confession.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.109
Take a seat, Mr. Hockney.

18:22.084 --> 18:24.161
Uh, look, this is just a
big misunderstanding.

18:24.162 --> 18:25.930
I mean, I-I'm on your
guys' side here.

18:25.931 --> 18:28.222
Our side doesn't
execute criminals.

18:29.623 --> 18:31.411
See, yeah, neither do I.

18:31.412 --> 18:33.952
Except for last night's
episode of "Two Half-Men."

18:33.953 --> 18:36.756
We have a witness, Chad.
She saw you kill Tyler Faris.

18:36.757 --> 18:38.434
And then like a moth to a flame,

18:38.435 --> 18:40.905
you were inexorably drawn back
to the scene of the crime.

18:40.906 --> 18:42.914
Which is when you realized
you lost part of your suit.

18:42.915 --> 18:46.107
So you came back to get it,
or rather, take it from us.

18:46.108 --> 18:48.486
This is all about your
father, isn't it?

18:48.829 --> 18:50.537
You're driven by his death?

18:51.864 --> 18:53.371
My father's in Miami.

18:53.453 --> 18:54.913
I-I don't know what you
people are talking about.

18:54.914 --> 18:56.097
So you're saying, you
weren't in the alley

18:56.098 --> 18:57.471
slapping my hand with your sword,

18:57.472 --> 18:59.952
and you didn't kill Tyler Faris?

19:00.011 --> 19:02.638
No. I-I would never kill anyone.

19:03.152 --> 19:05.031
I mean, n-neither
would Lone Vengeance.

19:05.736 --> 19:07.153
Aren't you Lone Vengeance?

19:07.154 --> 19:08.287
Not the real one.

19:08.297 --> 19:10.628
The real one being the
comic book character?

19:11.665 --> 19:13.987
Comic book characters
aren't real.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.003
Okay?

19:15.145 --> 19:17.870
I mean the guy who
assumed the persona

19:17.871 --> 19:19.460
of the comic book character.

19:19.461 --> 19:21.200
And who is that? No one knows.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.562
But he is a legend in the
superhero community.

19:23.677 --> 19:26.527
I dreamed of being him
when I was Red Marune.

19:26.562 --> 19:28.602
"Protector of all,
beholding to none"?

19:28.971 --> 19:29.890
You've heard of me?

19:29.891 --> 19:31.706
We saw the purse-snatching video.

19:32.145 --> 19:33.228
Yeah...

19:33.568 --> 19:34.449
that.

19:34.450 --> 19:35.548
Ugh.

19:36.460 --> 19:37.011
That hit the web

19:37.012 --> 19:39.283
and pretty much turned
Red Marune into a joke.

19:39.483 --> 19:40.879
Those were dark days.

19:41.126 --> 19:43.424
I was about ready to hang
up my tights for good,

19:43.974 --> 19:47.950
but then I decided to seek out
Lone Vengeance's counsel.

19:48.192 --> 19:49.403
What did he say?

19:50.449 --> 19:51.993
To stay the hell away from him.

19:52.176 --> 19:54.567
But that--that only
steeled my resolve.

19:54.705 --> 19:57.807
I mean, I made this
costume, I-I got a sword.

19:58.187 --> 20:00.750
I was about to go out on patrol
when you guys busted in.

20:00.751 --> 20:01.839
How do you find him?

20:01.897 --> 20:04.943
I-I heard that Lone Vengeance,
uh, frequented lower Manhattan.

20:04.944 --> 20:07.011
I-I roamed the streets night
after night looking for him.

20:07.046 --> 20:09.114
I finally ran into him, uh...

20:09.148 --> 20:11.349
near Beekman and Theatre Alley.

20:11.833 --> 20:14.152
I want to be his disciple.

20:14.186 --> 20:15.519
Maybe...

20:15.554 --> 20:17.588
his partner.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.501
It's--it's my destiny.

20:20.535 --> 20:22.136
He doesn't want a partner.

20:22.170 --> 20:23.804
How do you know?

20:25.340 --> 20:27.909
Lone Vengeance.

20:27.943 --> 20:29.143
"Lone."

20:32.180 --> 20:34.148
What do you mean, you can't
make a case against him?

20:34.182 --> 20:35.350
He's wearing the same suit.

20:35.351 --> 20:37.295
Yeah, well, apparently,
he's not the only one.

20:37.296 --> 20:39.177
Chad Hockney was in his apartment

20:39.178 --> 20:41.357
making that suit the
night of the murder.

20:41.358 --> 20:42.630
In fact, neighbors
were complaining

20:42.631 --> 20:44.028
about the noise from
the sewing machine.

20:44.029 --> 20:45.758
I told the mayor we had our man.

20:45.759 --> 20:47.314
Yeah, well, you shouldn't
have done that.

20:48.230 --> 20:50.107
Perhaps what I
shouldn't have done

20:50.108 --> 20:52.467
was place my faith
in you, detective.

20:55.451 --> 20:57.607
Guys, where are we
on the motorcycle?

20:57.793 --> 20:59.693
Checking registrations
on silver Kawasakis.

20:59.908 --> 21:01.342
We're also canvassing
around Beekman

21:01.376 --> 21:02.636
for other sightings
of Lone Vengeance.

21:02.637 --> 21:03.922
Okay, let's put in a court order

21:03.923 --> 21:05.475
for the names of
all of the people

21:05.476 --> 21:07.523
who downloaded the
Lone Vengeance comics.

21:07.524 --> 21:10.217
One of them might
be our murderer.

21:18.865 --> 21:20.666
To the untrained eye,

21:20.867 --> 21:23.802
this might look like a grown
man reading comic books, but--

21:23.837 --> 21:25.471
I've been thinking
about this, dad.

21:25.505 --> 21:27.606
I think you should
be happy for me.

21:28.060 --> 21:29.160
I am.

21:29.865 --> 21:31.577
I am. I'm just gonna
miss you, that's all.

21:32.532 --> 21:34.165
Me, too.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.701
But this is what I want.

21:36.736 --> 21:38.637
Come. Tell me about your classes.

21:38.671 --> 21:40.672
What will you be
taking in January?

21:40.706 --> 21:42.434
Uh, intro to statistics,

21:42.435 --> 21:44.943
microeconomic theory,

21:44.977 --> 21:47.478
the economic theory of the
Islamic Middle East--

21:47.513 --> 21:50.048
Isn't Ashley an economics major?
D--

21:50.083 --> 21:51.483
are you just taking his classes?

21:51.518 --> 21:53.485
That way, we can spend
more time together.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.435
What's wrong with that?

21:54.436 --> 21:56.588
To quote Spider-Man,

21:56.622 --> 21:59.158
"with great power comes
great responsibility."

21:59.192 --> 22:00.865
Not a lot of people get a chance

22:00.866 --> 22:02.560
to go to a school like this.

22:02.595 --> 22:04.963
You need to think
about your dreams

22:05.165 --> 22:06.542
and what you want.

22:07.105 --> 22:08.252
This is what I want.

22:08.434 --> 22:09.840
This is what Ashley wants.

22:10.060 --> 22:11.773
This wasn't even his idea.
It was mine.

22:11.774 --> 22:13.743
Well, this can't be all
about Ashley, Alexis.

22:13.744 --> 22:15.316
I mean, what if you guys break up?
What then?

22:15.317 --> 22:16.304
We're not gonna break up.

22:16.531 --> 22:17.932
Why are you trying to
talk me outta this?

22:17.966 --> 22:19.500
I'm not. I'm...

22:19.534 --> 22:21.969
I'm just trying to stop you
from making irrational choices.

22:22.004 --> 22:23.570
Why does everything I
do have to make sense?

22:23.605 --> 22:25.506
Why can't I just do what I
want every once in a while?

22:25.540 --> 22:27.408
That's all you ever do.

22:41.156 --> 22:42.456
Hi.

22:42.491 --> 22:43.724
I should've-- I should've called.

22:43.759 --> 22:45.993
Yoga, Castle.
I was doing... yoga.

22:46.027 --> 22:47.494
- Come on in.
- Gotcha.

22:47.529 --> 22:50.030
I found something that
will shock and amaze you.

22:50.064 --> 22:52.666
I downloaded all of the
"Sword of Lone Vengeances."

22:52.701 --> 22:54.568
That's not shocking or amazing.

22:54.603 --> 22:55.837
You didn't let me finish.

22:55.871 --> 22:57.705
I was looking for clues as
to the killer's identity

22:57.739 --> 22:58.706
in the comic books.

22:59.021 --> 23:01.442
I didn't find any, but
check out what I did find.

23:01.476 --> 23:03.143
Take a look at these panels.

23:03.177 --> 23:06.380
A hoodlum leaves his warehouse,
uh, Lone Vengeance swoops in,

23:06.414 --> 23:09.784
and then carves the letter
"l" in his right cheek.

23:09.818 --> 23:10.909
Who does that remind you of?

23:10.910 --> 23:11.825
Tony the Butcher.

23:12.242 --> 23:13.476
I checked the dates on the issue.

23:13.675 --> 23:16.457
It came out after Lone
Vengeance attacked him.

23:16.491 --> 23:19.560
These panels emulate that event.

23:19.594 --> 23:22.162
The only other person who was
there was our vigilante.

23:22.196 --> 23:24.298
So then you're saying
that-- it has to be.

23:24.333 --> 23:26.667
Our killer is the writer
of this comic book--

23:26.701 --> 23:28.135
Sean Elt.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.068
Okay, thank you.

23:34.170 --> 23:37.362
Sean Elt doesn't exist.

23:37.363 --> 23:38.840
His name is an alias.

23:38.875 --> 23:41.944
Or a nom de plume
as we writers say.

23:41.978 --> 23:45.647
Though why anyone would
choose "Sean Elt"...

23:46.288 --> 23:47.382
Wait a minute.

23:48.012 --> 23:49.046
It's an anagram.

23:49.247 --> 23:51.782
Change the letters
around, and you get...

23:51.816 --> 23:54.584
Stan Lee-- comic book genius.

23:54.619 --> 23:56.920
Trust me, he is no Stan Lee.

23:56.955 --> 23:58.388
He's not even Sean Elt.

23:58.422 --> 24:01.191
Yeah, all right. Thanks, Bill.
Maybe next time.

24:01.226 --> 24:03.660
All right. So no help from
tech on the real name.

24:03.694 --> 24:06.729
The Lone Vengeance web site is
registered solely to Sean Elt.

24:06.764 --> 24:08.198
Well, whoever he is,

24:08.233 --> 24:10.133
he put more than Tony the
Butcher in his comics.

24:10.168 --> 24:12.169
I found two more
real-life incidents

24:12.203 --> 24:13.737
that wound up as storylines.

24:13.771 --> 24:15.875
Lone Vengeance shook
down a drug dealer,

24:15.876 --> 24:18.475
and here, he set a truck full
of flat screens on fire.

24:18.509 --> 24:21.111
Okay, pull up the
two police reports.

24:21.145 --> 24:22.691
Let's see if they have
anything in common.

24:22.729 --> 24:24.082
- I'm on it.
- Thanks.

24:25.399 --> 24:26.833
Something doesn't add up.

24:27.845 --> 24:29.719
Lone Vengeance stamps out crime,

24:29.754 --> 24:31.288
both in the comics
and in real life.

24:31.323 --> 24:34.191
He's into this
vigilante-style ass kicking,

24:34.225 --> 24:36.526
or in Tony's case, ass carving,

24:36.560 --> 24:38.295
but never murder.

24:38.329 --> 24:40.430
So why would he suddenly
kill Tyler Faris,

24:40.464 --> 24:42.333
and why in such a brutal way?

24:42.367 --> 24:45.635
The "Sword of Lone Vengeance:
This time it's personal"?

24:45.669 --> 24:47.137
That has to be it.

24:47.171 --> 24:49.273
Tyler Faris must
have known Sean Elt.

24:49.307 --> 24:51.275
He didn't as best as I recall.

24:51.309 --> 24:53.310
I never heard of no Sean Elt.

24:53.344 --> 24:55.813
Did your son ever hang out
with the comic book crowd?

24:55.981 --> 24:57.693
Was he into comics?

24:57.694 --> 25:00.284
Just those slutty
schoolgirl ones.

25:00.318 --> 25:02.286
Oh, but lately, he had
gotten all into--

25:02.320 --> 25:03.520
oh, what was it? Uh...

25:03.989 --> 25:06.123
Uh, "Sword of Lone Vengeance."

25:06.324 --> 25:08.392
Did he ever mention the
writer of that comic?

25:08.426 --> 25:11.128
Was he hanging out with anyone
out of the ordinary lately?

25:11.162 --> 25:12.796
Somebody mild-mannered, perhaps?

25:12.830 --> 25:15.432
Actually, I saw him talking

25:15.533 --> 25:17.701
on the stoop to a guy
a few days back.

25:17.735 --> 25:19.870
He was different. Wore a suit.

25:19.904 --> 25:21.338
As in mask and cape?

25:21.506 --> 25:22.605
Jacket and tie.

25:22.640 --> 25:23.807
I overheard Tyler saying,

25:23.841 --> 25:27.544
"I know the truth.
I know who you really are."

25:27.578 --> 25:29.479
Do you think you
could describe him?

25:29.513 --> 25:32.715
Uh, fair-haired,
youngish, with a beard.

25:32.750 --> 25:35.118
Oh, and he wore one of them
plastic ID cards--

25:35.153 --> 25:36.153
a-a green one.

25:36.354 --> 25:38.322
Fair hair with a beard.

25:38.356 --> 25:39.689
A green press badge.

25:39.723 --> 25:41.558
The reporter from
the crime scene.

25:41.592 --> 25:43.560
Our suspect is one
Paul Whittaker--

25:43.594 --> 25:45.329
former graphic artist who
works the crime beat

25:45.363 --> 25:46.830
for the "New York Ledger."

25:46.864 --> 25:49.866
He's also a no-show at work
and he's not at home, either.

25:49.900 --> 25:52.169
We put out an APB
and we flagged his credit cards.

25:52.203 --> 25:54.238
Actually, that makes
perfect sense.

25:54.272 --> 25:56.540
As a crime reporter,
Paul would see firsthand

25:56.574 --> 25:58.575
how lawlessness would
ravage a community.

25:58.609 --> 26:01.078
Compelled to do more than
just write about it,

26:01.112 --> 26:03.347
he would don a mask and
form-fitting tights

26:03.381 --> 26:04.848
to become Lone Vengeance.

26:04.882 --> 26:07.184
But his plan to purge
the streets hit a snag

26:07.218 --> 26:09.027
when Tyler Faris
threatened to reveal

26:09.028 --> 26:10.336
his secret identity,

26:10.337 --> 26:12.889
causing Lone Vengeance
to cut him down

26:12.923 --> 26:14.891
in a single, fearsome blow.

26:17.728 --> 26:18.928
What?

26:18.963 --> 26:20.530
The student has
become the master.

26:20.564 --> 26:22.365
Or at least, he tried.

26:22.366 --> 26:25.068
Actually, for a truly
Castle-esque theory,

26:25.103 --> 26:27.771
it has to be fully
thought through.

26:27.805 --> 26:28.759
Since when?

26:28.864 --> 26:29.932
I did think it through.

26:29.966 --> 26:32.367
Really?
Then how did Tyler Faris know

26:32.468 --> 26:34.102
that Paul Whittaker
was Lone Vengeance?

26:34.137 --> 26:35.170
I've got that one.

26:35.271 --> 26:36.464
I just got off with the "Ledger."

26:36.846 --> 26:39.707
Turns out that our
reporter Paul Whittaker

26:39.742 --> 26:40.631
has a burner cell phone

26:40.632 --> 26:43.111
that he uses to talk to
confidential sources.

26:43.145 --> 26:46.280
It's the same number that
Tyler Faris made calls to.

26:46.315 --> 26:48.362
So Faris was a source
or a paid informant.

26:48.363 --> 26:49.351
So that's how they
knew each other.

26:49.552 --> 26:50.919
And so maybe

26:50.953 --> 26:52.654
Faris was tipping off Paul

26:52.688 --> 26:54.656
about crimes going down
in the neighborhood

26:54.690 --> 26:56.758
but Lone Vengeance kept
showing up instead.

26:56.792 --> 26:57.892
And that...

26:57.927 --> 26:59.794
is how Faris found out

26:59.829 --> 27:01.530
that Lone Vengeance
was actually Paul.

27:01.564 --> 27:04.032
He confronted Paul,
threatened to expose him...

27:04.066 --> 27:05.867
So Paul Whittaker killed
him to hide his identity

27:06.035 --> 27:08.369
as a half-assed superhero?

27:11.808 --> 27:12.908
Beckett.

27:12.942 --> 27:15.376
Actually, it's perfect
superhero psychology.

27:15.411 --> 27:17.779
It's symbiosis.

27:17.814 --> 27:20.348
See, Lone Vengeance is a
part of Paul Whittaker.

27:20.382 --> 27:22.783
Yin and Yang--one can't
exist without the other.

27:22.818 --> 27:24.319
Okay, seal off the area.

27:25.621 --> 27:27.155
Paul Whittaker just
maxed out his ATM

27:27.189 --> 27:28.323
at 71st and 7th.

27:28.491 --> 27:30.325
Hmm. That is one block
away from Comicadia.

27:30.360 --> 27:31.592
Hmm.

27:35.531 --> 27:37.099
2 grand for all this?

27:37.133 --> 27:39.334
Man, you got a "Hulk" 181 here.

27:39.369 --> 27:40.869
That alone is worth, like--

27:40.903 --> 27:42.737
I just need the money...

27:42.771 --> 27:45.340
I-in cash.

27:45.375 --> 27:48.143
Look, uh, I'm in a
bit of a hurry here

27:48.177 --> 27:49.978
so, uh... really?

27:50.012 --> 27:51.746
Where are you off to,
Mr. Whittaker?

27:51.780 --> 27:53.515
Or should we say

27:53.549 --> 27:56.184
Lone Vengeance?

27:59.856 --> 28:02.060
Really? Our killer's a writer?

28:02.351 --> 28:03.584
Well, writers can
be men of action.

28:04.162 --> 28:06.954
I've yet to see that, Mr. Castle.

28:06.988 --> 28:09.123
So he's a journalist,
like Peter Parker?

28:09.157 --> 28:11.359
Actually, Peter Parker
was a news photographer.

28:11.393 --> 28:13.994
Yeah, our guy's a little
more like, uh, Clark Kent.

28:14.028 --> 28:17.059
And he's mild-mannered,
just like I... predicted.

28:17.165 --> 28:18.198
Detective,

28:18.200 --> 28:19.567
I'd like to call the mayor,

28:19.601 --> 28:21.068
let him know that we
caught our killer.

28:21.102 --> 28:23.170
Try to get a
confession this time.

28:23.205 --> 28:24.572
Yes, sir.

28:26.875 --> 28:28.709
I think she's warming up to you.

28:28.711 --> 28:29.729
Mm-hmm.

28:29.956 --> 28:32.146
We're searching your
apartment, Paul.

28:32.180 --> 28:33.847
We found this artwork there.

28:33.882 --> 28:36.684
We know that you were behind
"Sword of Lone Vengeance."

28:37.523 --> 28:39.594
Well--well, there's no law
against that, is there?

28:39.794 --> 28:42.423
Except you took it a lot farther
than just making a comic book.

28:42.458 --> 28:43.591
I mean, it's only
a matter of time

28:43.625 --> 28:46.126
before we find the suit
and the murder weapon.

28:46.161 --> 28:48.596
Lone Vengeance stands for all
that is good and virtuous,

28:48.630 --> 28:51.299
an army of one at
war against crime,

28:51.333 --> 28:53.867
a defender of the innocent.

28:55.157 --> 28:56.971
But that's just a-a
character I created.

28:57.005 --> 28:58.539
It's not someone real.

28:58.574 --> 29:00.474
According to this, you
were mugged last year

29:00.509 --> 29:02.576
outside an abandoned
tenement building?

29:02.611 --> 29:04.078
Well, it's--it's New York.

29:04.112 --> 29:06.147
People--people get mugged.

29:06.181 --> 29:07.948
Only the mugger got
the worst of it.

29:07.982 --> 29:10.018
You ended up with a few stitches.

29:10.052 --> 29:11.786
The mugger ended up
in the hospital,

29:11.820 --> 29:14.088
and the cops say that you
were "noncompliant."

29:14.856 --> 29:16.023
You know, there's
a critical moment

29:16.057 --> 29:18.026
in the arc of every superhero,

29:18.646 --> 29:20.446
an awakening that transforms him,

29:20.480 --> 29:23.182
that drives him to
embrace his destiny.

29:23.184 --> 29:25.484
For you, the mugging
was that moment.

29:25.519 --> 29:26.786
That's when lone
vengeance was born.

29:26.821 --> 29:28.602
And then you used the
"Sword of Lone Vengeance"

29:28.603 --> 29:30.350
as your comic book diary.

29:31.244 --> 29:34.112
We know you killed
Tyler Faris, Paul.

29:34.147 --> 29:35.614
Your life is over,
both of your lives.

29:35.648 --> 29:37.082
You're going to prison.

29:37.116 --> 29:38.884
What do you think those
cons are gonna do

29:39.052 --> 29:41.653
when they find out that
you ran around in tights?

29:41.688 --> 29:44.322
If you help us,

29:44.357 --> 29:46.224
if you confess,

29:46.258 --> 29:47.470
I will keep you safe.

29:47.471 --> 29:51.163
I will get you placed
in segregated housing.

29:51.197 --> 29:54.200
Now that is a good deal, Paul.
I would take it if I were you.

29:57.203 --> 29:58.052
Okay.

29:58.319 --> 29:59.998
Okay. Okay.

30:01.822 --> 30:03.120
It's me.

30:03.670 --> 30:05.132
I'm Lone Vengeance.

30:05.935 --> 30:07.639
And Tyler Faris found out?

30:07.958 --> 30:09.810
Yeah.
He--he threatened to expose me,

30:09.860 --> 30:11.647
so I killed him.

30:15.397 --> 30:17.360
I'm gonna need you to
write that down, Paul.

30:21.885 --> 30:24.397
You said Lone Vengeance
stands for all that is good.

30:25.453 --> 30:26.695
So he has a code.

30:27.454 --> 30:28.496
So killing someone,

30:28.497 --> 30:30.907
even someone like Tyler Faris,

30:30.957 --> 30:32.590
violated that code.

30:33.689 --> 30:34.619
In a typical superhero,

30:34.669 --> 30:36.796
that would trigger
a crisis of faith.

30:36.846 --> 30:38.660
You must have been conflicted.

30:39.434 --> 30:41.968
How did you feel when
you killed Tyler Faris?

30:42.960 --> 30:44.400
Well, I-I felt bad.

30:44.450 --> 30:46.848
I-I felt... really bad.

30:50.042 --> 30:52.142
Paul, why did you
chop off Tyler's hand

30:52.192 --> 30:53.605
after you killed him?

30:54.418 --> 30:55.188
I don't know.

30:55.238 --> 30:56.858
I just--I just did.

30:57.465 --> 30:58.817
Can I--can I write
my confession now?

30:58.867 --> 30:59.945
Is--is that okay?

31:01.566 --> 31:02.644
Are you sure he didn't do it?

31:02.694 --> 31:05.327
Yeah, Faris' hand was chopped
off before he was killed.

31:05.377 --> 31:06.548
Paul didn't know that.

31:06.598 --> 31:07.837
Then why did he confess?

31:07.887 --> 31:10.113
Because Paul is protecting
the real killer.

31:10.163 --> 31:12.950
Paul is the writer.
Lone Vengeance is the subject.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.083
That's their relationship.

31:14.133 --> 31:15.469
It's you and me all over again,

31:15.524 --> 31:17.100
but I'm Paul, and
you're Lone Vengeance.

31:17.150 --> 31:18.486
Really, Castle, is
that how you see me,

31:18.536 --> 31:20.266
like a sword-wielding killer?

31:20.316 --> 31:21.849
Depends.
Will you be scantily clad?

31:21.850 --> 31:22.477
In your dreams.

31:22.527 --> 31:25.062
Not to rain on your
comic book fantasy,

31:25.112 --> 31:27.789
but if Paul is not
Lone Vengeance,

31:27.839 --> 31:29.275
it puts a whole new
spin on his mugging.

31:29.325 --> 31:32.298
That's right, it does.
I bet Paul didn't beat up that mugger.

31:32.348 --> 31:33.363
I bet that was Lone Vengeance.

31:33.413 --> 31:34.266
That's probably how they met.

31:34.310 --> 31:35.740
Wait a minute.
That abandoned tenement building

31:35.790 --> 31:37.200
where Paul was mugged,
where is that?

31:37.250 --> 31:38.786
Near Beekman and Theatre Alley.

31:38.836 --> 31:40.292
That's the same place
where Chad Hockney

31:40.342 --> 31:41.293
found Lone Vengeance.

31:41.343 --> 31:42.844
So either that's a coincidence...

31:42.894 --> 31:44.666
Or that's where he hangs out.

31:44.716 --> 31:46.539
An abandoned tenement building--

31:46.589 --> 31:48.294
perfect place for
a superhero lair.

31:51.714 --> 31:53.154
You sure this is the place?

31:53.204 --> 31:55.870
Yeah.
The power company said that...

31:55.920 --> 31:58.725
unit 209's the only
one with electricity.

31:58.775 --> 32:00.671
Somebody tied it up to a pole.

32:09.634 --> 32:12.268
Okay, if this is a lair,
can I just say...

32:12.318 --> 32:13.989
disappointing?

32:14.039 --> 32:16.441
I mean, where's the
mood lighting,

32:17.046 --> 32:19.674
the glass case with
50 samurai swords?

32:19.724 --> 32:20.906
Castle.

32:26.218 --> 32:27.240
All right.

32:27.691 --> 32:29.847
It's a modest lair
built on a budget.

32:30.627 --> 32:32.640
Wonder what else he's
got hidden around here.

32:33.223 --> 32:34.757
Beckett, got a guy
on the fire escape

32:34.807 --> 32:35.653
heading your way.

32:35.703 --> 32:36.731
I think it's him.

32:52.039 --> 32:53.468
NYPD. Do not move.

32:53.518 --> 32:55.305
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

32:55.355 --> 32:56.789
There are cops
everywhere downstairs.

32:56.839 --> 32:59.115
Now very slowly
take off that mask.

33:04.432 --> 33:06.181
Officer Hastings?

33:08.369 --> 33:10.492
I did not see that coming.

33:14.047 --> 33:16.411
Can you believe it,
Lone Vengeance,

33:16.461 --> 33:19.325
sword-wielding killer, ends
up being one of our own?

33:19.375 --> 33:21.195
I don't know.
Maybe she had her reasons.

33:21.245 --> 33:23.196
Whoa.
"Maybe she had her reasons"?

33:23.246 --> 33:24.626
What happened to
"nimrod in a suit"?

33:24.676 --> 33:26.174
Well, that's before I
knew she was a cop.

33:26.551 --> 33:28.420
CSU's going over your suit, Ann.

33:28.470 --> 33:30.817
They're looking for
Tyler Faris' blood.

33:30.867 --> 33:32.313
They won't find any.

33:32.363 --> 33:34.677
Yeah, well, you would
know how to clean it up.

33:36.404 --> 33:38.592
I always admired you, detective.

33:38.642 --> 33:39.824
The kind of cop that you are,

33:39.874 --> 33:41.199
it made me want to
get to know you.

33:41.946 --> 33:43.728
Well, you could've been
that kind of a cop.

33:44.300 --> 33:47.303
Awards, first-rate evaluation...

33:48.084 --> 33:49.337
Why'd you let it go?

33:51.394 --> 33:54.264
My father owned a dry
cleaners in the neighborhood.

33:54.314 --> 33:55.346
He got held up,

33:55.396 --> 33:57.304
by some junkie, probably.

33:58.257 --> 34:00.603
Shot dead over 80 bucks.

34:00.653 --> 34:03.726
The day after I buried him,
I applied to the academy.

34:03.776 --> 34:06.882
So then you decided to take
the law into your own hands?

34:07.443 --> 34:08.840
Being a cop wasn't enough?

34:08.889 --> 34:11.666
Someone killed my dad.
Nothing will ever be enough.

34:12.040 --> 34:14.371
But doing what I do
makes me feel better.

34:17.110 --> 34:18.670
We arrested Ann.

34:19.275 --> 34:20.853
I just thought you should know.

34:23.333 --> 34:24.753
You're...

34:24.803 --> 34:27.876
Probably wondering why
I confessed, then.

34:29.954 --> 34:31.165
You're in love with her.

34:33.484 --> 34:34.650
You crossed the line, Ann.

34:34.701 --> 34:36.829
Don't pretend like
we're so different.

34:37.181 --> 34:38.786
Let's talk about Tyler Faris.

34:38.835 --> 34:41.260
- Didn't you lose your mom?
- We're not here to discuss that.

34:41.310 --> 34:42.789
Didn't you shoot the
guy who killed her

34:42.839 --> 34:45.021
right here in this precinct?

34:45.071 --> 34:45.920
The bullet that you took,

34:45.969 --> 34:47.828
isn't that connected
to her murder, too?

34:47.878 --> 34:48.953
Because that's the rumor.

34:49.003 --> 34:50.757
I am not like you.

34:50.806 --> 34:53.228
I didn't chop a man in half.

34:53.279 --> 34:54.076
Neither did I.

34:54.126 --> 34:55.725
Yes, you did, and you've
got Paul Whittaker

34:55.775 --> 34:57.348
so turned around over it,

34:57.398 --> 34:59.486
that he tried to confess
to your murder.

34:59.536 --> 35:02.082
Paul? Why would he do that?

35:02.132 --> 35:03.808
Damn it. I... I told him

35:03.858 --> 35:05.964
to leave town until I
got this sorted out.

35:06.014 --> 35:07.129
Well, you got it sorted out now.

35:07.179 --> 35:09.571
I did not kill Tyler Faris.

35:09.621 --> 35:11.627
I threw up my breakfast
when I saw that body.

35:11.677 --> 35:13.706
You were in the
alley with me, Ann.

35:13.756 --> 35:15.564
You took that piece
from your suit.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.348
It wasn't from my suit, and
the only reason I wanted it

35:18.425 --> 35:20.251
was to figure out
who's behind this.

35:20.301 --> 35:22.945
- Do you actually expect me to believe you?
- It's true.

35:22.995 --> 35:25.070
I saw that disk at
the crime scene.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.610
I knew it wasn't mine,

35:26.660 --> 35:28.688
but before I could get it,
I got sent off to canvass.

35:28.738 --> 35:29.843
So I came back for it.

35:29.893 --> 35:32.427
And, yes, I took it from you.

35:32.477 --> 35:33.659
And what did you do with it?

35:33.709 --> 35:36.133
I had a friend in the crime
lab run it for prints.

35:36.183 --> 35:37.409
It came back with a partial,

35:37.459 --> 35:39.334
but it wasn't in the
criminal database.

35:39.384 --> 35:42.292
Look, if you don't believe me, ask him.
He still has it.

35:42.342 --> 35:44.789
So somebody else dressed
up as Lone Vengeance

35:44.839 --> 35:46.054
and killed our victim?

35:46.104 --> 35:47.658
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

35:47.708 --> 35:50.046
How does that make sense?

35:50.096 --> 35:51.816
Because it wasn't me.

35:53.071 --> 35:55.577
I came across something
when I canvassed Matt's bar

35:55.627 --> 35:57.227
where Tyler Faris came from.

35:57.277 --> 35:58.733
He was a creature of habit.

35:58.783 --> 36:00.174
He drank there every night.

36:00.224 --> 36:02.065
He'd always leave
between 1:00 and 2:00

36:02.115 --> 36:04.082
and take the back
door to the alley,

36:04.342 --> 36:05.917
usually with a girl.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.758
So you're saying
that the killer knew

36:09.808 --> 36:11.933
Faris was gonna show
up in that alley?

36:14.344 --> 36:16.185
Well, she didn't
kill Tyler Faris.

36:16.235 --> 36:17.120
How do you know?

36:17.170 --> 36:18.704
I... I just...

36:19.484 --> 36:20.738
I know.

36:20.788 --> 36:23.421
Well, if she didn't do it and
Chad Hockney didn't do it,

36:23.471 --> 36:25.488
then we're looking at a
third Lone Vengeance,

36:25.538 --> 36:26.894
a clever imposter.

36:26.944 --> 36:29.325
Okay, so, uh, let's
suppose that our killer

36:29.375 --> 36:30.314
is an imposter.

36:30.364 --> 36:33.372
That would mean that he
targeted Tyler Faris

36:33.422 --> 36:34.724
and wore a costume,

36:34.774 --> 36:36.707
either to make sure that
nobody could identify him...

36:36.757 --> 36:38.276
Or to make sure he
would be identified

36:38.326 --> 36:39.728
and frame Lone Vengeance
for the murder.

36:39.816 --> 36:42.059
And Tyler Faris was
the perfect victim.

36:42.109 --> 36:44.163
Yeah, he shows up in a
dark alley like clockwork,

36:44.213 --> 36:45.638
even brings his own witness.

36:45.688 --> 36:47.364
Okay, so then maybe our
killer was a criminal

36:47.414 --> 36:49.696
who wanted Lone Vengeance
off the streets...

36:49.746 --> 36:51.926
A criminal who wanted vengeance
against Lone Vengeance

36:51.976 --> 36:53.180
and Tyler Faris...

36:53.230 --> 36:56.116
Someone who knew Tyler
and his habits.

36:56.166 --> 36:57.985
Someone who had experience
wielding a blade.

36:58.035 --> 36:59.478
Someone who pointed
us to Lone Vengeance

36:59.528 --> 37:00.513
in the first place.

37:00.773 --> 37:02.744
You think I killed Tyler Faris?

37:03.492 --> 37:05.101
Come on. You're dreaming.

37:05.361 --> 37:07.528
We know you wanted lone
vengeance off the streets.

37:07.578 --> 37:08.948
He was costing you money.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.508
We read the comics.

37:10.558 --> 37:12.565
Lone Vengeance was shaking
down your dealers,

37:12.615 --> 37:14.115
burning your trucks.

37:14.165 --> 37:15.380
So when Faris thought

37:15.430 --> 37:17.810
that he figured out Lone
Vengeance's true identity,

37:17.860 --> 37:19.750
he knew you'd pay
top dollar for it.

37:20.186 --> 37:22.440
All right, even if this
were true, which it's not,

37:23.100 --> 37:24.589
I got no motive for murder.

37:24.639 --> 37:26.883
You had to be asking
yourself all these times

37:26.933 --> 37:29.192
Lone Vengeance was
harassing your people,

37:29.242 --> 37:30.970
how did he know where to go?

37:31.335 --> 37:32.765
Who was tipping him off?

37:32.815 --> 37:34.682
I mean, it had to have been
someone from the inside,

37:34.732 --> 37:36.449
someone with an ax to grind,

37:36.823 --> 37:38.603
someone just like Tyler Faris.

37:38.653 --> 37:40.221
So you figured,

37:40.271 --> 37:42.023
why not kill two birds
with one stone?

37:42.343 --> 37:44.108
Get rid of Faris and
hang the murder

37:44.158 --> 37:45.542
on Lone Vengeance.

37:46.674 --> 37:47.778
And that's it?

37:48.357 --> 37:49.721
I mean, that's all you got?

37:52.723 --> 37:54.064
You guys call yourselves cops?

37:54.114 --> 37:55.479
You oughta be embarrassed.

37:56.370 --> 37:57.492
Here's the problem--

37:58.723 --> 38:00.329
you got no proof.

38:07.317 --> 38:08.610
Actually, we do.

38:10.384 --> 38:11.656
That's from your outfit.

38:11.706 --> 38:14.647
We matched the partial print
to your cousin Ernesto.

38:14.697 --> 38:15.912
The tailor.

38:15.962 --> 38:18.419
I've heard great things about
his custom-made shirts.

38:18.469 --> 38:21.311
But he also confessed to
making a Lone Vengeance outfit

38:21.361 --> 38:22.697
for you.

38:27.382 --> 38:28.935
I want a lawyer.

38:30.120 --> 38:31.714
And you will need one.

38:39.061 --> 38:40.402
Those are your personal effects.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.844
You probably want to make
sure everything is there.

38:44.625 --> 38:46.619
Thanks, detective Beckett.

38:47.269 --> 38:49.138
Ann, you're a good cop.

38:49.188 --> 38:51.745
And you've got somebody
who cares about you.

38:53.713 --> 38:55.264
Don't be so driven by the past

38:55.314 --> 38:57.265
that you throw away your future.

39:00.157 --> 39:01.389
Take care.

39:13.134 --> 39:14.280
Well, a murder solved

39:14.281 --> 39:16.686
and a notorious hoodlum off
the streets for good--

39:17.203 --> 39:18.764
I call that a solid win.

39:18.814 --> 39:20.288
I agree.

39:20.338 --> 39:22.250
All because of the hard
work and dedication

39:22.300 --> 39:23.691
of this team.

39:24.142 --> 39:25.748
Thank you, captain.
That means a lot.

39:25.798 --> 39:27.265
Of police officers.

39:27.969 --> 39:30.421
Team of police officers,
Mr. Castle.

39:31.072 --> 39:32.523
Detective.

39:33.095 --> 39:34.580
About officer Hastings...

39:34.630 --> 39:37.494
She, uh, fled the alley when
you ordered her to stop.

39:37.544 --> 39:39.782
Some reason you're not
pressing any charges?

39:39.832 --> 39:41.102
I, uh...

39:41.152 --> 39:43.708
Think that given the number of
folks wearing that costume,

39:43.758 --> 39:45.445
we can't prove that it
was her in the alley,

39:45.495 --> 39:47.106
or anywhere else for that matter.

39:47.766 --> 39:49.316
Exactly, sir.

39:49.366 --> 39:51.109
She's a promising officer.

39:51.159 --> 39:52.835
That said, it'd be
bad for all of us

39:52.885 --> 39:55.823
if Lone Vengeance were
to show up ever again.

39:55.873 --> 39:58.325
I don't think that that
will be a problem, sir.

39:58.375 --> 40:00.434
Well, let's make sure it isn't.

40:03.876 --> 40:06.340
Either she just grew a heart...

40:06.390 --> 40:08.352
Or she's worried about
how it would look

40:08.402 --> 40:09.331
if the press found out

40:09.381 --> 40:11.130
that Lone Vengeance
was one of our own.

40:14.456 --> 40:16.028
A writer and his muse...

40:16.078 --> 40:17.304
Fighting crime,

40:18.986 --> 40:19.921
just like us.

40:31.369 --> 40:32.359
Tomorrow?

40:33.041 --> 40:33.855
Mm-hmm.

40:33.986 --> 40:34.998
Okay.

40:47.208 --> 40:48.407
Oh, hello, mother.

40:49.415 --> 40:52.121
Ah, Falstaff.

40:52.171 --> 40:53.539
Really?

40:53.589 --> 40:54.997
It's King Lear. Oh.

40:56.904 --> 40:58.565
I have work to do.

41:01.666 --> 41:02.681
Hey. What's up?

41:03.305 --> 41:04.800
Uh, skyping with Ashley.

41:04.850 --> 41:06.604
But we just finished.

41:07.978 --> 41:09.136
You know...

41:10.155 --> 41:12.993
even when you were a little girl,

41:13.043 --> 41:14.527
you were a serious person.

41:15.148 --> 41:16.435
I think I've just...

41:16.485 --> 41:18.854
gotten used to you being...

41:18.904 --> 41:20.811
sensible and mature,

41:20.861 --> 41:22.362
even more than me sometimes.

41:22.412 --> 41:23.619
Sometimes?

41:23.836 --> 41:24.825
Point taken.

41:24.875 --> 41:27.619
The thing is, Alexis, I know
there are other sides to you--

41:28.608 --> 41:30.042
impulsive sides,

41:30.863 --> 41:32.534
romantic sides,

41:34.085 --> 41:36.122
and I don't want
you to deny them.

41:37.158 --> 41:38.345
You were right.

41:40.184 --> 41:43.242
With great power does come
great responsibility.

41:43.292 --> 41:45.945
I've always been good at
doing what I'm supposed to.

41:45.995 --> 41:48.969
But--but college is about
doing what you want,

41:49.019 --> 41:50.803
you know, following your passion.

41:51.608 --> 41:53.511
I'm picking my own classes.

41:53.577 --> 41:55.413
I don't know which ones yet,

41:55.463 --> 41:57.768
but, um, no economics.

41:58.028 --> 41:58.987
And you know what?

41:59.037 --> 42:00.803
Even if you're not in
classes with Ashley,

42:00.853 --> 42:03.200
you still will see
each other plenty.

42:03.250 --> 42:05.452
I know, especially if
we move in together.
