WEBVTT

00:00.736 --> 00:02.903
Land ho!

00:02.937 --> 00:04.605
I'd like to go back and retrieve the gold.

00:04.657 --> 00:06.607
Refit, hire a consort, finish the job.

00:06.659 --> 00:08.860
- Is that possible?
- Well, it might have been possible.

00:08.911 --> 00:11.111
Before the bay fell into
the hands of a madman.

00:11.163 --> 00:12.830
Either we act now to
remove him or no one will.

00:12.865 --> 00:15.332
Congratulations, Jack.

00:15.368 --> 00:17.668
Now you know what it's like
to rise from the grave.

00:17.703 --> 00:19.787
We're gonna sail again.

00:19.839 --> 00:22.339
Your judgment with her is clouded at best.

00:22.375 --> 00:24.174
And there's nothing I can do to counter it

00:24.210 --> 00:26.960
when I'm on the wrong side of that door.

00:26.962 --> 00:28.796
Found the prize they was hiding.

00:28.848 --> 00:30.297
Her father is Lord Peter Ashe,

00:30.299 --> 00:32.016
governor of the Carolina colony.

00:32.051 --> 00:33.967
Lord Ashe won't be trifled with.

00:33.969 --> 00:36.103
I have no intentions of trifling with him.

00:36.138 --> 00:39.690
Charles Vane and the animals he commands

00:39.725 --> 00:43.143
have until sunrise tomorrow
to vacate that fort

00:43.195 --> 00:45.195
or, so help me God,

00:45.231 --> 00:47.881
I will rain holy hell down upon him.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:19.385 --> 03:21.018
Go on.

03:23.138 --> 03:25.689
"If you fail to meet these demands,"

03:25.724 --> 03:27.774
if you remain when the deadline arrives,

03:27.810 --> 03:30.143
I will respond swiftly and definitively.

03:30.196 --> 03:34.147
And as I currently sit fully
outside your means of retaliation,

03:34.149 --> 03:37.951
this response will continue
unabated until you,

03:37.987 --> 03:41.655
your men, and that structure
are rendered fully incapacitated.

03:41.657 --> 03:44.291
"Until dawn, Captain James Flint."

03:54.336 --> 03:56.753
Get him out of here.

03:58.807 --> 04:00.257
Put him behind a door somewhere.

04:00.309 --> 04:03.176
I want him whole when
he delivers my answer.

04:08.851 --> 04:10.291
Make ready the guns in the northwest.

04:10.319 --> 04:12.986
Move everything we have
to the southwest bastion.

04:13.022 --> 04:16.322
He's telling the truth.
The southwest bastion

04:16.358 --> 04:19.243
is too weak to support
any batteries at all.

04:21.697 --> 04:24.698
We have no guns that
can reach his position.

04:25.918 --> 04:30.704
Somehow Flint knew exactly
where to sit to take advantage.

04:33.208 --> 04:35.626
Then find out how close I can get.

04:36.879 --> 04:38.178
Now.

04:53.195 --> 04:55.228
Tell me right now you had
nothing to do with this.

04:55.281 --> 04:57.814
- Charles, look at me.
- Tell me this isn't part of your plan

04:57.866 --> 05:00.117
- to push me into the sea.
- Look at me.

05:05.991 --> 05:07.741
I had no idea this was coming.

05:07.793 --> 05:10.127
I had no idea that Flint
would be so fucking reckless

05:10.162 --> 05:12.245
as to threaten the fort itself.

05:12.298 --> 05:14.665
I had no idea Hornigold
would be so fucking petty

05:14.717 --> 05:16.300
as to divulge secrets about its weaknesses,

05:16.335 --> 05:18.835
risk its destruction for
his own personal gain.

05:18.887 --> 05:21.088
I told you what I would do
if challenged like this.

05:21.140 --> 05:22.673
- I know.
- I may not be able to hit his ship,

05:22.725 --> 05:24.257
but I can hit the rest of them.

05:24.310 --> 05:26.593
I can turn that whole
goddamn bay into a graveyard.

05:26.645 --> 05:28.929
- But you won't.
- You doubt me?

05:28.981 --> 05:32.766
No, I have faith in your ability

05:32.768 --> 05:35.018
to formulate a plan more
effective than this.

05:38.157 --> 05:41.825
The initial barrage will be
targeted at the southeast bastion.

05:41.860 --> 05:43.694
Once the turrets are destroyed,
we'll turn our aim

05:43.746 --> 05:45.946
to the weaker of the defensive walls.

05:45.948 --> 05:48.281
Hammer them until the interior is exposed

05:48.334 --> 05:51.785
and the fort is vulnerable to
an assault from the ground.

05:51.787 --> 05:55.339
At this point, there's no limit
to the damage we can inflict.

05:55.374 --> 05:57.958
- How long to rebuild?
- Rebuild?

05:58.010 --> 06:00.794
After we secure possession
of what's left of the fort,

06:00.846 --> 06:03.646
how long will it take you and your
men to rebuild what we've destroyed?

06:04.967 --> 06:07.801
10 weeks before the batteries are restored.

06:07.803 --> 06:10.637
Twice that to resecure the interior.

06:10.689 --> 06:12.639
It is a risk,

06:12.691 --> 06:15.609
but a relatively short
window in the grand scheme.

06:15.644 --> 06:18.195
A short window that coincides
with a British warship

06:18.230 --> 06:20.697
sitting in anchor 40 miles from here

06:20.733 --> 06:23.734
and my having stolen a Spanish warship

06:23.786 --> 06:25.819
in full view of a company
of Spanish soldiers.

06:29.908 --> 06:33.160
We'll just have to keep our fingers
crossed for a while, then, won't we?

06:33.212 --> 06:35.579
Are you suggesting the threat we posed

06:35.631 --> 06:39.216
to Captain Vane is an empty one and we
have no intent of following through?

06:39.251 --> 06:41.251
I am fully committed, as are we all,

06:41.303 --> 06:43.837
to the removal
of Captain Vane from that fort.

06:43.839 --> 06:45.922
But we'd be fools to ignore

06:45.974 --> 06:48.258
the catastrophic risks
that lie down this road.

06:48.310 --> 06:50.761
I have committed men
and resources to aid you

06:50.813 --> 06:52.479
in retrieving the Urca gold.

06:52.514 --> 06:55.348
In exchange for which you've
assured me of your assistance

06:55.401 --> 06:59.186
of expelling Captain Vane from
that fort by any means necessary.

06:59.188 --> 07:02.022
Now, as I hear you waver,

07:02.024 --> 07:06.193
I feel forced to ask,
if the sun rises tomorrow

07:06.195 --> 07:08.695
and Vane has not ceded to our demands,

07:08.747 --> 07:10.864
then what will you do?

07:32.654 --> 07:34.270
I was told it was urgent.

07:34.322 --> 07:36.322
He said he wanted to see you right away.

07:37.492 --> 07:40.577
What about?

07:40.612 --> 07:43.329
It's all right.
It has nothing to do with you and I.

07:55.210 --> 07:57.961
He'll be arriving in less than two hours.

07:58.013 --> 08:01.829
I'm sorry, who?

08:02.050 --> 08:04.551
The fourth Earl of Ashbourne.

08:04.553 --> 08:07.387
Lord Proprietor to the Carolina colony,

08:07.439 --> 08:08.938
including the Bahama Islands,

08:08.974 --> 08:10.473
and peer of the realm.

08:10.525 --> 08:12.559
Lord Alfred Hamilton.

08:12.611 --> 08:14.944
My father.

08:14.980 --> 08:18.031
I'm told he expects a
full report of our efforts

08:18.066 --> 08:21.151
to devise a plan for the
management of Nassau.

08:21.203 --> 08:24.454
And you're concerned how he'll receive it?

08:24.489 --> 08:27.157
I'm concerned about how he'll
receive one particular part of it.

08:27.209 --> 08:30.910
The part you and I have yet to discuss.

08:32.464 --> 08:34.297
I didn't think we had one of those.

08:36.585 --> 08:40.419
These past few months

08:40.472 --> 08:43.056
I have come to trust you.

08:44.426 --> 08:45.675
Very much.

08:45.727 --> 08:48.261
Which is why I feel I
can ask for your help.

08:48.263 --> 08:51.097
When my father arrives,
I intend to propose something to him

08:51.099 --> 08:53.099
which could be very dangerous politically.

08:53.101 --> 08:55.568
What is it you want me to help you with?

08:57.405 --> 08:59.355
I want you to try to talk me out of it.

09:34.109 --> 09:36.309
Yes?

09:37.479 --> 09:39.562
Ma'am, you're needed.

09:39.614 --> 09:41.364
All right.

10:09.274 --> 10:11.428
It's a Spanish warship!

10:11.490 --> 10:15.665
There's a Spanish galleon
anchored in the harbor!

10:15.701 --> 10:18.919
Is today some sort of holiday
that I've forgotten about?

10:18.954 --> 10:21.788
Spanish warship anchored in the bay.

10:21.790 --> 10:23.957
Word is it's Flint's crew sailing her.

10:23.959 --> 10:27.260
And it's scaring the shit
out of everyone on the beach.

10:27.296 --> 10:30.797
Flint's sailing a Spanish warship?

10:30.849 --> 10:33.099
Think we should try and
lure some of them inside?

10:38.307 --> 10:40.941
Wait. Does he have it?

10:40.976 --> 10:42.526
Does he have what?

10:42.561 --> 10:44.311
Did Flint get to the Urca gold?

10:44.313 --> 10:45.645
I don't know.

11:09.254 --> 11:11.171
Hold there.

11:13.842 --> 11:15.759
The fuck are you doing?

11:15.811 --> 11:17.928
The situation is as we feared.

11:17.980 --> 11:20.847
That warship is fully
outside our field of fire.

11:22.267 --> 11:24.901
And given our severe disadvantage,

11:24.937 --> 11:27.938
might she provide us valuable leverage?

11:27.990 --> 11:30.690
Make sure Flint knows the
moment he fires those guns,

11:30.742 --> 11:34.027
her body gets dumped over the wall.

11:34.079 --> 11:35.829
Your reply to Flint will be significantly

11:35.864 --> 11:37.197
more effective if it
comes from me personally.

11:37.199 --> 11:39.082
You might want to keep quiet now, miss.

11:40.535 --> 11:42.869
You have questions about my loyalties

11:42.871 --> 11:44.838
as it relates to Miss Guthrie?

11:46.792 --> 11:51.678
Then accuse me. Challenge me. Fight me.

11:51.713 --> 11:54.514
Or shut the fuck up about it.

11:56.351 --> 11:58.051
Open the gate!

12:55.694 --> 12:57.077
What are you doing here?

12:58.163 --> 12:59.863
Putting an end to this.

13:07.539 --> 13:08.539
Miss Guthrie.

13:10.125 --> 13:12.509
Captain Vane has issued a
reply to your ultimatum.

13:12.544 --> 13:14.844
It's being read aloud on
the beach as we speak.

13:16.798 --> 13:18.715
I think you should see it.

13:26.058 --> 13:28.808
Give us the room.

13:28.810 --> 13:31.227
- I have as much right...
- Now, please!

13:47.462 --> 13:49.712
"You must ask yourselves who represents"

13:49.747 --> 13:52.832
the greater threat to your interests...

13:52.884 --> 13:56.135
my men in this fort

13:56.170 --> 13:58.387
"or the madman on the water."

13:58.423 --> 14:00.389
It's effective.

14:00.425 --> 14:02.675
Mm, I can see that.

14:02.727 --> 14:07.230
What I cannot see is how
Charles Vane alone was clever enough

14:07.265 --> 14:09.565
to turn this all into political theater

14:09.601 --> 14:13.019
in which he is the defender
of the island's welfare.

14:13.021 --> 14:15.354
Are you suggesting he had
help in crafting his reply?

14:15.406 --> 14:17.990
Did he?

14:18.026 --> 14:20.776
Were I to have aided
Captain Vane against your efforts,

14:20.828 --> 14:24.113
helped him move into a more
favorable position last night,

14:24.165 --> 14:28.451
what would such a move say about the
trust you and I are supposed to share?

14:28.503 --> 14:31.170
I believe I was clear yesterday
about the danger he represents

14:31.205 --> 14:33.456
and my desire to see him
removed from that fort.

14:33.508 --> 14:35.124
Though you conveniently omitted the part

14:35.176 --> 14:37.009
about how you were prepared
to use a Spanish warship

14:37.045 --> 14:38.761
to annihilate the fort to achieve that end.

14:38.796 --> 14:41.213
Your refusal to acknowledge the urgency

14:41.215 --> 14:43.382
of the situation gave me no choice but...

14:43.434 --> 14:47.353
But to do what? Disregard our partnership?

14:47.388 --> 14:49.722
Ignore the resources and influence
and trust I have invested in you?

14:49.724 --> 14:52.224
This isn't personal.

14:52.277 --> 14:54.393
It's too important for that.

14:56.397 --> 14:58.064
All right, then.

14:58.066 --> 14:59.982
What is it you wish to accomplish here?

15:01.819 --> 15:03.703
To see him removed from the fort.

15:03.738 --> 15:07.540
Then this is a stupid fucking
way of going about it.

15:07.575 --> 15:10.710
He'll never voluntarily leave if he
thinks it will show weakness to do so.

15:10.745 --> 15:12.745
You want him out, here's how you do it.

15:12.747 --> 15:16.666
You move this ship.
You allow him to save face on this score.

15:16.718 --> 15:21.220
And then you and he and I sit down
at a table and we sort it out.

15:21.255 --> 15:26.225
Eleanor,
I don't care if he leaves voluntarily.

15:28.396 --> 15:31.397
If I give up this position,
I will never regain it.

15:31.432 --> 15:34.433
And without this position,
the decision is his and his alone.

15:34.435 --> 15:36.152
No, I simply cannot risk that.

15:36.187 --> 15:37.570
Not with what's at stake.

15:37.605 --> 15:39.271
You are talking about rendering this bay,

15:39.324 --> 15:41.407
rendering Nassau completely unprotected.

15:41.442 --> 15:44.110
I know!

15:44.112 --> 15:46.412
And I am perfectly aware of
the danger that presents.

15:46.447 --> 15:50.416
But when it comes to Charles Vane, you and
I simply do not see him in the same way.

15:52.787 --> 15:55.705
Now, if you can see a way,

15:55.757 --> 15:58.374
an effective, credible way out of this

15:58.426 --> 16:00.376
that doesn't involve disabling the fort,

16:00.428 --> 16:02.294
I would love to hear it.

16:02.347 --> 16:03.763
If you think that he will hear reason.

16:03.798 --> 16:05.514
Not with you holding a gun to his head.

16:05.550 --> 16:07.299
Then I suggest you talk to him.

16:07.301 --> 16:09.685
Because one way or another,
he is leaving that fort.

16:09.721 --> 16:11.971
And right now my way is the only way

16:12.023 --> 16:13.522
that I can be certain of that.

16:57.769 --> 17:00.686
My name is Charles Vane
and you are now my guest.

17:00.738 --> 17:04.607
As such, no harm will come to you
as long as you do exactly as I say.

17:04.659 --> 17:07.108
You understand?

17:09.497 --> 17:13.031
The other one, he said no talking.

17:14.202 --> 17:16.001
Captain Low?

17:17.789 --> 17:20.039
You don't need to worry about him anymore.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.758
How can you be sure?

17:24.846 --> 17:26.295
I cut his head off.

17:32.804 --> 17:34.220
Good.

17:37.608 --> 17:40.726
Now, your father is Lord Peter Ashe,

17:40.728 --> 17:43.979
governor of the Carolina colony.
Is that right?

17:45.617 --> 17:47.650
What is the total value of his estate?

17:47.702 --> 17:49.235
I don't know.

17:49.287 --> 17:52.622
How many rooms in his house?
How many slaves?

17:52.657 --> 17:55.575
Honestly, I don't know.
Haven't seen him in years.

17:56.962 --> 17:59.829
I've been at school in London.

17:59.881 --> 18:01.297
Are you close with him?

18:01.333 --> 18:03.249
What?

18:03.251 --> 18:05.969
I'm asking if there's any
reason I should expect

18:06.004 --> 18:10.139
he may not be willing to pay
to ensure no harm comes to you?

18:14.512 --> 18:17.096
You're asking if he loves me?

18:23.855 --> 18:25.655
He'll pay you what you ask.

18:32.781 --> 18:34.113
Can you write?

18:36.284 --> 18:37.500
Of course.

18:37.535 --> 18:39.919
Then write the following.

18:42.791 --> 18:46.125
You're a prisoner of the
pirate Captain Charles Vane.

18:46.177 --> 18:49.583
Your ransom, should your father
ever wish to see you alive again,

18:49.584 --> 18:51.797
is £250,000.

18:51.799 --> 18:53.766
The next contact I'll
make will be to arrive

18:53.801 --> 18:55.718
in Charlestown harbor
with you in my possession.

18:55.770 --> 18:59.305
If I sense a trap or my demands are unmet,

18:59.357 --> 19:02.274
I'll kill you and throw
your body into the bay.

19:07.148 --> 19:08.531
Do you understand?

19:57.415 --> 19:59.365
She's writing the letter now.

19:59.367 --> 20:01.667
I want it on its way to Charlestown

20:01.702 --> 20:04.503
before whatever's going to
happen here tomorrow happens.

20:04.538 --> 20:06.372
Right.

20:06.374 --> 20:08.507
Who are they?

20:08.542 --> 20:11.961
Friends from the beach.

20:13.764 --> 20:16.715
They have pledged
their services to Captain Vane

20:16.717 --> 20:20.686
to defend the fort and to
discourage any move against it.

20:20.721 --> 20:24.023
It seems his pronouncement
has had the intended effect.

20:27.194 --> 20:29.144
And 40 men becomes 60

20:29.196 --> 20:31.480
and the fight ahead only gets bloodier.

20:31.532 --> 20:34.066
Then get out there. Sit with the captains.

20:34.068 --> 20:35.567
Talk some sense into them.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.536
Tell them that it's their ships and cargo

20:37.571 --> 20:40.739
that will be subject to his
extortion the moment it suits him.

20:40.741 --> 20:42.408
I'll get to the beach.
Appeal directly to the crews.

20:42.460 --> 20:44.460
If we can stop anyone
else from going up there,

20:44.495 --> 20:46.135
we can keep this from getting out of hand.

20:58.676 --> 21:02.144
Can I assume when you say
you'll go to the beach

21:02.179 --> 21:04.596
to make this appeal, you mean me?

21:07.068 --> 21:09.018
All right, then.

21:11.739 --> 21:14.106
Why do you think they went up that hill?

21:15.576 --> 21:18.444
Beg your pardon?

21:18.496 --> 21:20.746
If we're to stop any more
men from joining his side,

21:20.781 --> 21:23.082
isn't it a prerequisite
that we try and understand

21:23.117 --> 21:25.167
the thinking of the men who
have already joined him?

21:26.537 --> 21:29.621
Sorry, are you asking my opinion?

21:33.544 --> 21:35.127
Oh.

21:35.129 --> 21:38.797
Well, uh...

21:38.799 --> 21:43.102
I suppose one could argue
that it's simple fear.

21:43.137 --> 21:45.971
Their fear of losing the fort

21:46.023 --> 21:49.358
being greater than their
fear of Vane remaining in it.

21:49.393 --> 21:50.859
But then again,

21:50.895 --> 21:53.696
it's possible this has
nothing to do with the fort.

21:53.731 --> 21:55.647
Nor with Vane.

21:55.649 --> 21:59.034
Perhaps it's just them expressing
their opinions about you.

21:59.070 --> 22:01.403
So you think that they see me

22:01.455 --> 22:03.238
as the villain in this particular story?

22:04.742 --> 22:08.210
I think that would explain
their decision, yes.

22:10.438 --> 22:14.550
And you? What do you think?

22:14.585 --> 22:16.668
You see me as the villain here?

22:18.506 --> 22:22.591
I see you as the agent most likely

22:22.643 --> 22:25.144
of securing my share of
the gold on that beach.

22:25.179 --> 22:27.429
As long as that remains true,

22:27.481 --> 22:30.315
I am not bothered in the
least by whatever labels

22:30.351 --> 22:32.151
anyone else decides to affix to you.

22:37.331 --> 22:39.074
Why?

22:41.195 --> 22:42.995
What do you think about it?

22:45.166 --> 22:47.199
I'm sorry?

22:49.787 --> 22:52.588
It bothers you, doesn't it?

22:52.623 --> 22:54.506
What they think?

22:57.511 --> 22:59.762
With the things you've done...

22:59.797 --> 23:03.215
My God.

23:04.852 --> 23:08.520
It must be awful being you.

23:11.893 --> 23:14.476
Time is short.

23:14.528 --> 23:17.062
You'd better be off.

23:25.656 --> 23:28.407
We have reasonable proposals to
recruit men for the expedition.

23:28.459 --> 23:30.409
To procure supplies and to ferry them.

23:30.461 --> 23:32.711
But it will be the approach to
dealing with the Nassau pirates

23:32.746 --> 23:34.463
by which the entire plan will be judged.

23:34.498 --> 23:36.415
I feel that's where we're strongest.

23:36.417 --> 23:39.501
Targeted raid on the beach
under cover from two men-of-war.

23:39.553 --> 23:42.554
Public trials and hangings of
roughly a dozen of the ringleaders.

23:42.590 --> 23:45.424
And the replacement of the governor
with an officer of our choosing.

23:45.426 --> 23:46.975
It's precise, it's affordable,

23:47.011 --> 23:48.427
and it'll play well with the Sea Lords.

23:48.429 --> 23:51.063
I understand that's the expected proposal.

23:51.098 --> 23:53.816
The safest one.
But it's not the one I would like to make.

23:53.851 --> 23:57.236
When my father arrives,
I would like to propose to him

23:57.271 --> 23:59.655
that we don't hang the pirates.

23:59.690 --> 24:03.108
- That we pardon them.
- I'm sorry, what was that?

24:03.160 --> 24:06.445
I want to pardon them.

24:06.497 --> 24:08.197
- You want to pardon them?
- Yes.

24:10.451 --> 24:13.502
- How many?
- All of them.

24:13.537 --> 24:15.497
- All right.
- The island needs commerce to survive.

24:15.506 --> 24:18.590
It needs labor. It needs men and
women vested in its interest.

24:18.626 --> 24:20.066
Don't these men fit that description?

24:20.094 --> 24:21.293
Couldn't they become part of the solution?

24:21.345 --> 24:23.262
You don't need me to answer that.

24:23.297 --> 24:24.546
- They're men.
- They're traitors to the Crown.

24:24.598 --> 24:27.299
- What difference does that make?
- Makes some difference to the Crown.

24:27.301 --> 24:29.184
Just answer me this, would it work?

24:30.554 --> 24:33.272
To pardon a traitor is the act of a coward.

24:33.307 --> 24:35.474
And given our current war footing,

24:35.526 --> 24:38.694
precisely no one in Whitehall
wants to wear that label right now.

24:38.729 --> 24:41.029
If you propose this to your father,

24:41.065 --> 24:45.150
he will almost certainly distance
himself from it and most likely from you.

24:45.152 --> 24:47.402
Now, I only know
what I've heard of your father,

24:47.454 --> 24:49.571
but if half of what I've heard is true,

24:49.623 --> 24:51.740
he's not a man one wants as an enemy.

24:53.744 --> 24:56.078
If you're asking me as your
liaison to the Admiralty,

24:56.130 --> 24:58.747
my advice to you

24:58.799 --> 25:01.583
is that this is a maneuver
only to be approached

25:01.635 --> 25:03.218
with utmost caution.

25:05.055 --> 25:08.340
But as your friend,

25:08.392 --> 25:11.343
I suggest you forget
you ever thought of it.

25:16.433 --> 25:18.183
They came through the gate like locusts,

25:18.235 --> 25:19.851
Vane and his men.

25:19.904 --> 25:22.154
Brothers of mine being hacked to pieces.

25:22.189 --> 25:24.690
I swear to Christ Almighty,

25:24.692 --> 25:27.859
it wasn't the screams that haunt me most.

25:27.861 --> 25:30.529
It was their laughter.

25:30.581 --> 25:34.666
I thought they said no one survived
the raid from Captain Hornigold's crew.

25:34.702 --> 25:38.337
Well, I guess one of them
must have gotten away.

25:38.372 --> 25:42.841
So what do you make of this business
between Captains Flint and Vane?

25:45.346 --> 25:47.963
Thank you. Lovely performance.

25:57.057 --> 25:58.523
Hello, friend.

25:58.559 --> 26:02.527
Man around the bend has something to say
about this business at the fort.

26:05.399 --> 26:07.399
The fuck's going on in there?

26:07.401 --> 26:09.401
Pulled a man out of the water.

26:09.403 --> 26:11.403
Up by the north point.

26:11.455 --> 26:13.372
That's lucky.

26:13.407 --> 26:15.707
We were just about to send for one of you.

26:15.743 --> 26:16.908
Excuse me?

26:16.961 --> 26:18.994
You're a Walrus man, aren't you?

26:19.046 --> 26:20.462
Sorry, what are you talking about?

26:20.497 --> 26:21.964
He's one of yours.

26:54.615 --> 26:58.700
I assume Captain Flint wasn't
amenable to your suggestion.

26:58.752 --> 27:01.953
He's not listening to me and
this place is slipping into ruin.

27:01.955 --> 27:05.707
It's my commitment to
see this fort protected

27:05.759 --> 27:08.260
from all enemies, all threats.

27:08.295 --> 27:10.962
So as you consider where
to lay your support,

27:11.015 --> 27:14.683
consider which of us represents
the greatest threat...

27:14.718 --> 27:17.769
my men in this fort or
the madman on the water?

27:17.805 --> 27:20.889
- How many criers did you pay?
- Four total, as you asked.

27:20.941 --> 27:22.307
Sent to the ends of the camps.

27:22.309 --> 27:23.942
But what I don't understand

27:23.977 --> 27:25.861
is why we're supporting
Captain Vane's position.

27:25.896 --> 27:27.646
We're not supporting it, we're relaying it.

27:27.648 --> 27:31.066
With all due respect,
I can't see the difference.

27:31.118 --> 27:32.734
I think I can live with that.

27:32.786 --> 27:34.202
So what do we do now?

27:35.489 --> 27:37.050
The only one who can stop this is Flint.

27:37.074 --> 27:39.825
I'll just have to find
someone to convince him.

27:42.546 --> 27:45.547
He's moving in a direction
that promises unimaginable chaos.

27:45.582 --> 27:48.216
He won't listen to me,

27:48.252 --> 27:50.802
but perhaps he would listen
to an appeal from you.

27:53.841 --> 27:56.975
I appreciate your frustration.

27:57.010 --> 27:59.450
Were there something I could do to help,
I assure you I would.

27:59.480 --> 28:02.147
You can make him see how
destructive his actions would be.

28:02.182 --> 28:04.399
- You can make him...
- If you believe...

28:04.435 --> 28:06.852
if you believe anyone can
make him see anything,

28:06.854 --> 28:08.770
you must not know him very well at all.

28:10.858 --> 28:13.742
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

28:13.777 --> 28:16.161
You weren't here the last time they came.

28:16.196 --> 28:18.830
200 Spanish soldiers walked onto the beach.

28:18.866 --> 28:21.867
They burned the huts on the beach
and then the structures in town.

28:21.919 --> 28:24.369
When the whole of Nassau
was a smoking wreck,

28:24.421 --> 28:26.421
they turned their eye inland.

28:26.457 --> 28:28.924
They raped, they murdered,

28:28.959 --> 28:30.625
they laid waste.

28:30.677 --> 28:33.128
And all because there was
no fort to protect the bay.

28:33.180 --> 28:35.881
The men in charge had allowed
it to fall into disrepair.

28:37.968 --> 28:41.553
Please, help me to dissuade him

28:41.605 --> 28:43.805
from putting us on that path again.

28:43.857 --> 28:46.141
If you're concerned for your safety,

28:46.193 --> 28:47.726
perhaps you should request sanctuary

28:47.778 --> 28:49.444
along with your father
at the Underhill estate.

28:49.480 --> 28:50.729
I'd be happy to carry the message.

28:50.731 --> 28:52.564
You think this is about me?

28:52.566 --> 28:55.817
You asked me for my help
yesterday with Mr. Underhill.

28:55.869 --> 28:58.403
I gave it my best efforts.
You asked me today again for my help,

28:58.455 --> 28:59.788
but I'm sorry,

28:59.823 --> 29:02.624
what you ask is simply impossible.

29:02.659 --> 29:05.494
You don't give a shit
about the rest of us, fine.

29:07.748 --> 29:10.465
But Flint. Don't you care enough about him

29:10.501 --> 29:12.918
to at least try to stop
him from doing this?

29:14.555 --> 29:16.471
Don't I care about him?

29:16.507 --> 29:18.590
He's the one in the most immediate danger.

29:18.592 --> 29:20.642
- And you would do nothing...
- You who have enabled him,

29:20.677 --> 29:22.727
encouraged his violence,

29:22.763 --> 29:25.764
you ask if I care about him?

29:25.816 --> 29:28.600
How dare you?

29:30.304 --> 29:32.988
Get out of my house.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.132
Yes? What?

30:01.134 --> 30:03.602
- New recruits?
- Mm-hmm.

30:03.637 --> 30:07.022
It would appear your reconciliation
with Captain Vane has borne fruit.

30:07.057 --> 30:10.275
Though, perhaps,
of the low-hanging variety.

30:10.310 --> 30:12.978
Thank you for your concern.

30:14.898 --> 30:16.231
Did you know?

30:17.568 --> 30:19.150
Before she opened the door?

30:21.872 --> 30:23.872
No, I didn't know.

30:24.992 --> 30:26.741
You must care for her a great deal.

30:26.793 --> 30:30.328
Not once all night did you so
much as look in my direction.

30:31.832 --> 30:34.216
I've seen enough to know to
keep my distance from you,

30:34.251 --> 30:35.800
thank you very much.

30:35.836 --> 30:38.003
The situation was not of my making.

30:38.055 --> 30:39.838
If it was anyone's, it was yours.

30:39.890 --> 30:41.723
I'm sorry, what?

30:41.758 --> 30:44.843
The conflict within her.
I had it under control.

30:44.845 --> 30:47.679
Right until the moment you
walked in on her and me.

30:47.731 --> 30:51.850
For that was the moment you began
the competition between you and me.

30:51.902 --> 30:54.436
What is happening here, the three of us,

30:54.488 --> 30:56.238
it is only temporary.

30:56.273 --> 30:59.691
A state of denial until
she finally makes a choice.

30:59.693 --> 31:02.027
A choice between you and I?

31:04.748 --> 31:07.198
Anne and I have been by each other's sides

31:07.200 --> 31:09.918
since she was 13 years old.

31:09.953 --> 31:13.088
We have sailed together.
We've killed together.

31:13.123 --> 31:16.041
We have shared things you
couldn't begin to imagine.

31:16.093 --> 31:18.793
You've shared a bed with her for a week.

31:18.845 --> 31:22.047
You'd be amazed what can
change in a week in my bed.

31:25.052 --> 31:28.219
I understand you're feeling
quite indispensable of late.

31:28.272 --> 31:31.222
But rest assured, it only seems that way.

31:31.224 --> 31:33.224
I wouldn't get too comfortable were I you.

31:33.277 --> 31:37.729
And what if I can get you
back on the water with a crew?

31:37.731 --> 31:40.949
Would I still only
seem indispensable then, too?

31:42.736 --> 31:44.653
One of the girls has a lead?

31:44.705 --> 31:46.905
Mm, but which one?

31:46.907 --> 31:51.042
They're so mistrustful of
male authority figures.

31:51.078 --> 31:54.796
It'll take some time before they
report these things to you and not me.

31:59.086 --> 32:00.885
Come.

32:04.424 --> 32:08.093
Mr. Featherstone.
Been a regular for months now.

32:08.145 --> 32:10.261
The navigator on the Colonial Dawn.

32:10.263 --> 32:13.064
Finest on the island, so he says.

32:13.100 --> 32:15.767
He's all right. Go on.

32:15.819 --> 32:18.937
Put my tongue in his bum,
he'd tell me anything.

32:18.939 --> 32:21.906
So I did and he did.

32:21.942 --> 32:24.109
He's looking to move.

32:24.111 --> 32:26.911
Said the men were split badly
over the mess on the beach.

32:26.947 --> 32:29.114
Some backing Flint,
some saying he'd gone mad.

32:29.116 --> 32:31.750
Said the crew been fraying
for some time, anyway.

32:33.291 --> 32:36.838
Said in all likelihood, a lot of those men
would follow him wherever he went

32:36.873 --> 32:38.506
on account of his skills.

32:38.542 --> 32:42.794
And we have a plan
to sway him and his men to our camp?

32:42.796 --> 32:44.963
I'm going to fuck the
living shit out of him.

32:47.017 --> 32:50.218
If he chooses to join
Captain Rackham's crew,

32:50.270 --> 32:52.804
that decision must be heartfelt.

32:52.856 --> 32:54.973
It cannot be cast into doubt
the moment the pleasure fades.

32:55.025 --> 32:57.108
And for that, you cannot just fuck him.

32:57.144 --> 32:58.643
You must seduce him.

33:01.782 --> 33:04.733
Yes, there is a difference.

33:04.785 --> 33:06.951
The breath in his ear.

33:06.987 --> 33:10.238
The arch in your back when he
thinks he is making you finish.

33:10.290 --> 33:13.158
The look in your eyes when
you finally breathe again

33:13.210 --> 33:16.044
that tells him you would do
anything he asked in that moment.

33:16.079 --> 33:18.663
Anything at all without hesitation.

33:18.715 --> 33:22.000
The story you tell him that night
about when you were a little girl,

33:22.052 --> 33:25.637
about the place you hid from your mother
where the world was quiet.

33:25.672 --> 33:30.008
A story you've never told another soul.

33:30.010 --> 33:32.143
The look of confusion you show him

33:32.179 --> 33:33.845
when you wake up the next morning

33:33.897 --> 33:36.431
that tells him despite
the thousand other men

33:36.483 --> 33:39.851
you've awoken beside, that he is unique.

33:39.853 --> 33:42.153
That he has seen you vulnerable.

33:42.189 --> 33:44.105
And that you cannot live without him.

33:46.943 --> 33:48.827
I completely understand.

33:51.782 --> 33:55.250
Just so we're clear,
I still fuck the shit out of him, yes?

33:57.003 --> 33:59.003
Yes.

33:59.039 --> 34:01.840
Is there anything else
you would like to add?

34:03.593 --> 34:05.877
Uh, no. No, I don't think so.

34:17.023 --> 34:18.556
Tell me again,

34:18.608 --> 34:20.891
who are those men camped out
in your family's storehouse?

34:20.893 --> 34:22.277
What men?

34:22.312 --> 34:24.062
Perfect.

34:28.784 --> 34:30.869
We're doing wrong.

34:30.904 --> 34:32.954
He can't be on the ship right now.

34:32.989 --> 34:35.824
Captain is holding things
together with both hands

34:35.876 --> 34:38.042
and Billy will, understandably,

34:38.078 --> 34:40.745
have some feelings about the
events of this past week.

34:40.797 --> 34:43.465
If those feeling were expressed right now,

34:43.500 --> 34:47.668
it could spoil whatever chances
we have to retrieve the Urca gold.

34:54.143 --> 34:55.760
Where is this?

34:57.230 --> 34:59.931
It's all right. You made it home.

35:09.776 --> 35:11.109
What was that?

35:12.913 --> 35:16.498
Get... Gates.

35:42.108 --> 35:44.893
Featherstone and Idelle?

35:44.945 --> 35:48.062
- Max told me.
- Ah.

35:48.114 --> 35:51.482
Been in there going on three hours.

35:51.535 --> 35:53.535
Do you think she can do it?

35:53.570 --> 35:55.370
Swing him our way?

35:55.405 --> 35:58.323
I think I have underestimated my last whore

35:58.375 --> 36:00.325
for a while,
given the week I've been having.

36:04.965 --> 36:07.966
I've put a lot of bodies in
the ground for you, haven't I?

36:10.554 --> 36:11.669
Excuse me?

36:11.671 --> 36:13.388
Watched your back.

36:13.423 --> 36:14.672
Cleaned up your messes.

36:14.674 --> 36:17.508
Carried out your plans.

36:19.512 --> 36:21.512
I didn't always understand.

36:21.565 --> 36:24.265
Didn't always agree.

36:25.602 --> 36:27.402
But I did it.

36:27.437 --> 36:30.405
Some fucked-up, awful shit
'cause I knew you needed it done.

36:31.691 --> 36:33.608
I don't think the night you had last night

36:33.660 --> 36:35.526
comes even close to
something to bitch about.

36:35.528 --> 36:39.530
I know you know this is
significantly more complicated

36:39.583 --> 36:42.450
than the quantity of tits I have
access to at any given moment.

36:42.502 --> 36:45.620
I know she's dangerous.

36:45.672 --> 36:48.289
Especially to me.

36:48.341 --> 36:51.292
I ain't in my right head about her.

36:51.344 --> 36:53.378
She knows it.

36:53.430 --> 36:55.296
And it ain't hard to imagine her intent

36:55.348 --> 36:57.765
is to play us off one against the other.

36:57.801 --> 37:00.852
But I'm asking you to do this for me.

37:02.606 --> 37:04.439
I'm asking you to watch my back

37:04.474 --> 37:06.975
on the other side of that door.

37:07.027 --> 37:10.528
'Cause I know as long as you are, there
ain't shit she can do to get between us.

37:46.983 --> 37:50.184
Mr. Featherstone will announce
to his shipmates tomorrow

37:50.236 --> 37:52.186
that he has joined a new crew.

37:52.238 --> 37:53.604
Your crew.

38:01.164 --> 38:02.447
What?

38:08.038 --> 38:10.254
He believes a number of
his men will join him

38:10.290 --> 38:12.256
upon hearing this news.

38:12.292 --> 38:14.459
At least 28 men.

38:16.262 --> 38:18.212
That's more than half his crew.

38:18.264 --> 38:19.630
In addition to these new recruits,

38:19.632 --> 38:23.468
you will be granted command
of their ship as well.

38:25.188 --> 38:27.555
Congratulations, Captain.

38:44.708 --> 38:47.325
A few more men in the fort
now than two hours ago,

38:47.377 --> 38:50.244
though I believe we stemmed the tide there.

38:50.296 --> 38:54.665
The captains I've spoken with are
on firm agreement with our position.

38:54.718 --> 38:56.384
Several of them have
committed men and resources

38:56.419 --> 38:58.336
to the final assault up the hill.

38:58.338 --> 39:01.723
Though we have yet to hear
from your man Mr. Silver,

39:01.758 --> 39:04.058
word has come in from the beach.

39:04.094 --> 39:05.593
Support is in our favor,

39:05.645 --> 39:08.513
though division amongst the
remaining crews is rampant.

39:08.565 --> 39:12.400
Reports of skirmishes amongst and
within the camps has been arriving...

39:12.435 --> 39:14.352
Numbers, please.

39:14.354 --> 39:16.237
Pardon?

39:16.272 --> 39:20.691
We're well aware of the discord
caused by Captain Vane's entreaty.

39:20.744 --> 39:23.828
I want to know what we'll be
facing if we go down this road.

39:29.502 --> 39:32.370
Roughly 65 men in the fort,
plus or minus 10.

39:32.372 --> 39:34.205
We bring to bear 90 men on our own

39:34.257 --> 39:37.542
plus 50 pledged by sister crews.

39:37.544 --> 39:40.094
On rough terrain and
fighting an entrenched enemy,

39:40.130 --> 39:42.680
I think it's safe to assume that casualties

39:42.715 --> 39:45.466
will number threescore on our side.

39:45.518 --> 39:47.552
As I've said, we ought harbor no illusions

39:47.554 --> 39:49.520
about the blood that will
be spilled on that hill.

39:54.277 --> 39:56.144
Father, how was your travel
from the country?

39:58.114 --> 40:00.398
Wet.

40:02.402 --> 40:04.235
Well, I think you're most optimistic

40:04.287 --> 40:06.487
about the Admiralty's willingness to outfit

40:06.539 --> 40:09.574
these ships you assume you can procure.

40:09.576 --> 40:11.492
But as for the rest of it,

40:11.544 --> 40:13.628
seems like a reasonable proposal.

40:13.663 --> 40:15.630
Do you agree, Lieutenant?

40:15.665 --> 40:17.632
Yes. Yes, I would, sir.

40:17.667 --> 40:22.503
I see. Well, then, perhaps we can discuss

40:22.555 --> 40:27.225
the one element you so
conveniently elected to ignore.

40:27.260 --> 40:29.310
What about the pirate raiders of Nassau?

40:34.934 --> 40:36.767
I want to put them to work.

40:36.820 --> 40:38.736
To work? At what?

40:38.771 --> 40:40.571
Tilling, harvesting, coopering,

40:40.607 --> 40:42.773
building, smithing, fishing.

40:42.826 --> 40:44.909
What are you talking about, Thomas?

40:47.280 --> 40:49.697
I intend to secure them pardons.

40:51.284 --> 40:53.284
A blanket amnesty for any
man who will accept it.

40:53.336 --> 40:55.253
In exchange for his allegiance,

40:55.288 --> 40:58.623
his renunciation of violence and his labor.

41:03.179 --> 41:05.796
What a piece of work you are.

41:05.849 --> 41:08.132
You asked me to formulate a plan.

41:08.184 --> 41:09.851
That's what I've done.

41:11.304 --> 41:14.639
I asked you to formulate a plan

41:14.691 --> 41:18.192
that would secure the support
of the navy in our efforts.

41:18.228 --> 41:21.145
Support without which
there is little chance

41:21.147 --> 41:24.315
of reversing the catastrophic
downward trend in revenue

41:24.367 --> 41:25.983
from the Bahama territories.

41:26.035 --> 41:29.203
Support that is almost
certain to disappear entirely

41:29.239 --> 41:32.823
and for good the moment they
hear they are to be associated

41:32.825 --> 41:36.494
with a plan to reward men who are
in open revolt against the Crown.

41:36.546 --> 41:39.881
This is the solution most likely
to lead to our desired result.

41:39.916 --> 41:41.916
It also has the virtue of
being the right thing to do.

41:41.968 --> 41:44.635
Oh, for God's sake.

41:44.671 --> 41:47.171
Lieutenant, am I right to assume

41:47.173 --> 41:48.723
that a proposal such as this...

41:48.758 --> 41:50.174
Don't look at him. Talk to me.

41:55.848 --> 41:58.015
My son is impertinent, Lieutenant.

41:58.067 --> 42:00.318
My son is indulged.

42:00.353 --> 42:02.904
My son is self-righteous.

42:02.939 --> 42:05.690
But he's not stupid.

42:07.026 --> 42:08.993
Perhaps you could explain to me

42:09.028 --> 42:11.362
how you intend to distract the queen

42:11.364 --> 42:13.998
from her war to issue these pardons.

42:14.033 --> 42:15.666
I wouldn't need her to do anything.

42:15.702 --> 42:17.335
A simple act would
accomplish the same thing.

42:17.370 --> 42:19.704
Of Parliament? There aren't four votes

42:19.756 --> 42:21.289
among the lords for
something as absurd as this.

42:21.341 --> 42:24.542
Sutton, Dunster, Lewis, Form, Philpott.
There's five.

42:24.544 --> 42:26.877
They're easy. I haven't even opened
my mouth to make an argument.

42:26.930 --> 42:28.713
An argument to abet
sedition in times of war?

42:28.765 --> 42:31.766
A war, sir, to ensure that a
Protestant sits on the throne of Spain.

42:31.801 --> 42:33.517
Thomas, if I were a rival of this family,

42:33.553 --> 42:35.937
I would be shouting from
the rooftops that any man

42:35.972 --> 42:38.723
who proposes to pardon a
traitor in times such as these

42:38.775 --> 42:40.057
is himself a traitor.

42:40.059 --> 42:43.110
We are fighting a war in the
service of the son of God.

42:43.146 --> 42:45.896
And it is treason to offer forgiveness
to any man who would seek it?

42:45.949 --> 42:47.198
What in the hell is it you
think we're doing here?

42:47.233 --> 42:49.066
This isn't your goddamn salon, Thomas.

42:49.068 --> 42:52.974
If you do not forgive men their sins,
your father will not forgive your sins.

42:52.989 --> 42:55.456
- I don't want to hear it!
- I know you don't.

43:06.886 --> 43:09.503
Lieutenant.

43:09.555 --> 43:12.223
I'll ask you once again,

43:12.258 --> 43:14.976
am I to assume by your silence

43:15.011 --> 43:18.145
that you are in agreement
with this proposal?

43:20.099 --> 43:21.983
The lieutenant has dutifully
expressed his reservations...

43:22.018 --> 43:24.769
Madam...

43:24.821 --> 43:29.273
you have done enough to damage
the good name of this family.

43:29.275 --> 43:31.442
I would ask that you keep both your mouth

43:31.444 --> 43:33.444
and your legs firmly shut going forward...

43:33.496 --> 43:35.780
I support it.

43:40.787 --> 43:43.004
I found his argument persuasive.

43:43.039 --> 43:46.090
I find his intent to be good and true.

43:46.125 --> 43:48.426
And I find yours wanting, sir.

43:50.380 --> 43:53.514
I will be relaying my findings to
Admiral Hennessey in short order.

43:53.549 --> 43:56.851
And now I think it's time you left, sir.

44:13.152 --> 44:16.070
Gentlemen.

44:32.422 --> 44:36.223
Did you just ask my father

44:36.259 --> 44:38.259
to leave his own house?

44:56.996 --> 45:00.197
Right now he will be dispatching
messages to the Sea Lords,

45:00.249 --> 45:02.700
the Southern Secretary,

45:02.702 --> 45:04.034
his friends in the Privy Council.

45:04.087 --> 45:07.838
He will stop at nothing to ensure
that this plan never sees the light of day.

45:07.874 --> 45:10.925
And now you're in the line of fire.

45:10.960 --> 45:13.010
People can say what they like about you.

45:15.848 --> 45:17.932
But you're a good man.

45:20.970 --> 45:23.637
More people should say that.

45:24.891 --> 45:27.024
And someone should be willing to defend it.

45:45.077 --> 45:46.827
Pastor.

45:46.879 --> 45:49.130
It's before dawn.

45:49.165 --> 45:51.832
I don't sleep anymore.

46:03.012 --> 46:04.929
I've seen you at my service.

46:04.981 --> 46:08.766
I've kept my distance,
but I've seen you there.

46:08.818 --> 46:11.152
Heard of your efforts
to join our community.

46:11.187 --> 46:12.853
To make a fresh start.

46:12.905 --> 46:16.023
I've wanted to believe it to be true.

46:16.075 --> 46:18.325
After...

46:18.361 --> 46:20.911
after what happened between you and I,

46:20.947 --> 46:24.081
I wanted to believe that
as vile as the act was,

46:24.116 --> 46:26.784
perhaps it was born of a misguided desire

46:26.836 --> 46:28.836
on your part to change your ways.

46:28.871 --> 46:30.704
To seek a more virtuous path.

46:32.875 --> 46:35.843
I do seek a more virtuous path.

46:35.878 --> 46:39.547
Then why am I also hearing that you've
been receiving Mr. Guthrie's daughter?

46:39.599 --> 46:42.800
Making requests
of Mr. Underhill on her behalf?

46:42.802 --> 46:44.435
You don't understand.

46:44.470 --> 46:47.771
I understand more than you think, ma'am.

46:49.976 --> 46:51.809
I've been to town today.

46:51.861 --> 46:54.612
I hear that one of the
thieves on the beach,

46:54.647 --> 46:57.648
desirous of impressing her,
assaulted another.

46:57.700 --> 47:00.150
Killed him.

47:00.152 --> 47:03.821
And in a display for all to see,
mounted his severed head on a pike.

47:03.823 --> 47:06.540
Were this not monstrous enough,

47:06.576 --> 47:09.076
talk is it was all in service
of stealing a young girl

47:09.128 --> 47:11.412
intended to be ransomed to her father.

47:11.464 --> 47:14.999
None other than the governor
of the Carolina colony.

47:15.001 --> 47:17.051
An upstanding, God-fearing man

47:17.086 --> 47:19.887
hundreds of leagues from here
is unsafe from their brutality.

47:19.922 --> 47:22.423
These are Miss Guthrie's associates.

47:22.475 --> 47:25.843
These are the men on whose behalf
you would act by doing her bidding.

47:25.895 --> 47:28.812
Men who seek profit
through the most boundless,

47:28.848 --> 47:31.181
wanton, unrepentant barbarism.

47:31.183 --> 47:34.685
And I'm to believe that your
desire to repent is genuine?

47:34.737 --> 47:36.520
Lord Ashe?

47:36.572 --> 47:38.572
What?

47:38.608 --> 47:40.491
The governor in Carolina,

47:40.526 --> 47:43.444
it is Lord Peter Ashe, it is not?

47:44.864 --> 47:46.614
I believe so, but...

47:47.867 --> 47:50.534
Lord Ashe's daughter, what was her name?

47:50.586 --> 47:53.120
Mrs. Barlow,
what difference does her name make?

47:53.172 --> 47:55.205
Abigail.

47:55.258 --> 47:58.542
Her name is Abigail Ashe.

47:58.544 --> 48:00.544
Absolution.

48:00.596 --> 48:03.213
A clean slate for all
those willing to accept it.

48:03.266 --> 48:05.215
A few hours ago, I informed my father

48:05.268 --> 48:08.802
that this was my intended solution for
the pirate issue on New Providence Island.

48:12.558 --> 48:15.059
We've talked in this room, you and I,

48:15.111 --> 48:16.560
about reason.

48:17.863 --> 48:19.146
We've talked about justice.

48:19.198 --> 48:21.482
We've talked about virtue and the right.

48:21.534 --> 48:23.233
We've talked and talked.

48:23.235 --> 48:25.402
And now, perhaps, it is time to do that

48:25.404 --> 48:28.072
which we've only spoken
about behind closed doors.

48:28.074 --> 48:30.407
I am committed to this end.

48:30.409 --> 48:34.161
But it is a long road and I will
need your help to see it through.

49:19.208 --> 49:21.041
How can I help?

49:23.212 --> 49:25.295
I don't believe you've
been properly introduced.

49:25.348 --> 49:27.097
Lieutenant McGraw...

49:28.300 --> 49:31.185
my good friend Lord Peter Ashe.

50:09.225 --> 50:10.924
What the fuck is this?

50:16.015 --> 50:18.182
I heard the news today.

50:18.184 --> 50:21.485
I thought it a sign it was
time to come and see you.

50:23.189 --> 50:25.105
You're kidding me.

50:25.157 --> 50:26.857
Coming to gloat now?

50:28.160 --> 50:30.744
You don't see it, do you?

50:30.780 --> 50:34.081
You're so close to having
everything you've wanted.

50:34.116 --> 50:37.201
Everything I told you you'll never have.

50:37.253 --> 50:39.169
It's within your reach.

50:39.205 --> 50:41.505
I came to help you get it.

50:53.219 --> 50:55.519
I remember when I first saw it.

50:55.554 --> 50:58.021
I'd never seen a structure like it.

50:58.057 --> 51:00.974
It seemed indestructible.

51:02.561 --> 51:05.395
If you would have told me then
the decision you face today,

51:05.448 --> 51:09.233
I don't know if I would
have believed it possible.

51:12.238 --> 51:16.206
Richard Guthrie sat on the throne
of commerce when I arrived.

51:16.242 --> 51:18.959
Made men rich, they said.

51:20.796 --> 51:24.214
Then his daughter took his place,
made Nassau strong.

51:25.918 --> 51:27.918
Everyone knows this.

51:29.672 --> 51:31.922
I wonder how many know
that there was one man

51:31.974 --> 51:34.925
standing behind them.

51:34.977 --> 51:37.644
Standing behind both thrones,

51:37.680 --> 51:39.596
keeping the world spinning.

51:43.269 --> 51:46.186
You're as invested in the
future of this place as any.

51:48.357 --> 51:49.823
What would you do?

51:54.947 --> 51:57.030
I know Eleanor's argument.

51:57.082 --> 52:00.450
And I know why you think it is weak
and I do not disagree with you.

52:00.503 --> 52:04.004
Her judgment about
Captain Vane has never been right.

52:04.039 --> 52:06.290
But because she is compromised,

52:06.342 --> 52:09.510
it does not necessarily
follow that she is wrong.

52:09.545 --> 52:11.628
I fear that to take that fort

52:11.630 --> 52:15.432
will be to divide this island
in a most dangerous way.

52:15.467 --> 52:18.135
To force men to take
sides against each other

52:18.187 --> 52:21.855
at a time when our very survival
demands the very opposite.

52:23.475 --> 52:25.192
I fear that if we go down that road,

52:25.227 --> 52:27.561
by the time Spain or England arrive,

52:27.613 --> 52:29.279
they will find their job done for them.

52:29.315 --> 52:32.866
They will find Nassau has destroyed itself.

52:34.954 --> 52:36.620
The world changes.

52:36.655 --> 52:38.655
It is inevitable.

52:38.707 --> 52:41.491
Perhaps the only thing that is inevitable.

52:43.162 --> 52:45.712
If it were me facing this decision,

52:45.748 --> 52:47.998
I would make peace with that.

52:48.050 --> 52:52.085
I would teach myself to see Captain Vane

52:52.137 --> 52:55.839
as an unfortunate but unavoidable change

52:55.841 --> 52:57.507
in our landscape.

52:59.345 --> 53:04.348
And I would ensure that we all live
to see the sunrise again tomorrow.

53:04.350 --> 53:05.899
Were it me.

53:55.901 --> 53:57.868
What say you, Captain?

54:09.672 --> 54:11.889
Fire.

54:17.022 --> 54:20.989
