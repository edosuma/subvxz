17:08.386 --> 17:09.854
You have toys?

17:09.954 --> 17:11.156
Yeah, I have a bunch of them.

17:11.255 --> 17:13.090
Maybe you and I could play with them?

17:13.190 --> 17:15.224
Okay. Yeah, great.

17:15.275 --> 17:16.637
- Kay.
- You go on ahead and I'll

17:16.682 --> 17:17.713
just... I'll catch up with you.

17:17.752 --> 17:18.805
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.366
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

17:21.465 --> 17:24.167
[softly] Oh, my God.

17:24.268 --> 17:27.538
"Play with toys"?

17:27.638 --> 17:30.341
This woman wants to have sex with me.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.876
[club music playing]

17:31.976 --> 17:37.215
<i>[line trilling]</i>

17:37.314 --> 17:38.783
<i>Hey, GB!</i>

17:38.882 --> 17:40.818
Chase can't talk right now.
We're dying his tongue.

17:40.918 --> 17:42.454
Dying his tongue?

17:42.553 --> 17:44.022
Yeah, we're just trying to
get it a little pinker.

17:44.121 --> 17:45.789
You know, girls don't like
a pale tongue.

17:45.890 --> 17:48.325
Well, uh, I was just calling
to tell Chase

17:48.426 --> 17:50.963
that, um, I... I booked that commercial.

17:51.062 --> 17:52.229
It's kind of a big deal.

17:52.330 --> 17:54.966
I think it's, like, $30,000.

17:55.065 --> 17:56.500
<i>Whoa, 30K!</i>

17:56.600 --> 17:59.170
That's, like, 3 Instagrams for Chase.

17:59.271 --> 18:01.740
Wait. How much does he make from...

18:01.840 --> 18:02.975
[phone buzzing]

18:03.074 --> 18:05.043
Hold on a second.

18:05.142 --> 18:06.477
Cary, I have an emergency.

18:06.578 --> 18:08.446
Where are you? I'll come find you.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.215
- I'm in SoHo.<i>
- What?</i>

18:10.314 --> 18:13.051
Why does everyone keep leaving me?

18:13.150 --> 18:14.686
I didn't want to come to this.

18:14.785 --> 18:16.587
Okay, Cary, you know how
I've always prided myself

18:16.687 --> 18:18.523
on probably being bisexual?

18:18.622 --> 18:20.123
Well, I went home
with this girl Brittlyn

18:20.224 --> 18:21.659
who, you know, offered me
a place to crash

18:21.760 --> 18:24.896
and now she wants to have sex and...

18:24.995 --> 18:26.831
I'm not into it.

18:26.931 --> 18:30.168
I mean, am I a straight woman?
That is nothing anymore.

18:30.268 --> 18:31.635
Wait, Brittlyn?

18:31.735 --> 18:34.238
Is she wearing so much makeup?

18:34.339 --> 18:36.073
Yeah, I mean, it looks amazing.

18:36.174 --> 18:37.542
She should do tutorials.

18:37.641 --> 18:39.376
She doesn't want to have sex with you.

18:39.476 --> 18:40.945
- That's rude.
- [chuckles]

18:41.044 --> 18:43.782
She's, um, she's 11.

18:43.881 --> 18:46.150
<i>You went home with an 11-year-old girl.</i>

18:46.251 --> 18:48.353
<i>[dramatic suspense music]</i>

18:48.453 --> 18:50.556
In this climate?

18:54.425 --> 18:56.127
15 minutes?

18:56.226 --> 18:57.594
Oh, hey.

18:57.696 --> 19:00.264
- Congrats on the part.
- Oh.

19:00.364 --> 19:02.400
Thanks. How'd you know?

19:02.501 --> 19:03.701
You were walking around the party,

19:03.801 --> 19:05.570
making a bunch of fake phone calls.

19:05.669 --> 19:08.005
Oh. No, no, no, those calls...

19:08.106 --> 19:09.841
those calls you were hearing,
they were very real.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.143
Those were real people
on the other line.

19:12.244 --> 19:14.044
[soft laugh]
It's okay, we've all done it.

19:14.145 --> 19:15.747
Yeah, I actually had to

19:15.847 --> 19:18.116
re-tape myself in the bathroom
just to get the part.

19:18.216 --> 19:20.385
Ew, I hate that. I always get, like,

19:20.485 --> 19:22.587
"Great, but can you do
it again, like, less gay?"

19:22.687 --> 19:25.122
It's like, "No. Fuck you.
Either cast me or don't."

19:25.223 --> 19:28.126
Yeah, no, uh, for me, it was...

19:28.225 --> 19:30.629
they just wanted it louder.

19:30.728 --> 19:33.064
Mm. Well.

19:33.165 --> 19:36.368
Congrats. And, uh, have a good night.

19:43.507 --> 19:47.311
[yawns] Morning!

19:47.410 --> 19:51.282
- Do I smell bacon?
- No.

19:51.381 --> 19:53.751
Sorry. Can I smell bacon?

19:53.851 --> 19:55.653
No, but

19:55.754 --> 19:58.923
I did make you something even better.

19:59.023 --> 20:02.060
[gasps] Oh, my God!

20:02.159 --> 20:04.629
Oh, Cary, the watermark looks so real.

20:04.728 --> 20:06.202
I know, right? I even gave you

20:06.272 --> 20:08.202
a little glamour mole, 'cause
I know you've always wanted one.

20:08.264 --> 20:10.788
- Aw, it's perfect.
- [chuckles]

20:11.968 --> 20:14.871
- Hey, sister roomie.
- [soft laugh]

20:14.972 --> 20:16.975
Hey!

20:19.910 --> 20:23.247
Okay, I'm gonna email this
to all my Ohio friends.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.249
[clears throat] "Hey, girlies.

20:25.350 --> 20:28.253
"Long time, no talk.
We should really hang soon.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.554
"Maybe camping?

20:30.655 --> 20:35.160
Anyway, how are you?
I'm doing see attached."

20:35.260 --> 20:38.229
Oh, my God, they are
going to be so jealous.

20:38.329 --> 20:41.264
It's insane. Send.

20:41.366 --> 20:43.568
And so I ask you, Governor,
why is it that

20:43.668 --> 20:45.402
five years later, the people of Flint

20:45.503 --> 20:47.563
still do not have clean drinking water?

20:47.633 --> 20:49.703
- [cell phone buzzes, chimes]
- Sorry.

20:52.709 --> 20:56.747
I think this girl I grew up with
got married at a movie premiere?

20:56.798 --> 20:58.814
<i>I think she also grew a new mole.</i>

20:58.872 --> 20:59.940
<i>Anyway.</i>

20:59.984 --> 21:02.553
I actually did
a lot of theater in college.

21:02.654 --> 21:05.423
Um, yeah, I was weirdly in a main stage

21:05.523 --> 21:08.426
my freshman year, which was
sort of a big deal.

21:08.525 --> 21:10.594
Um, yeah, and this was
the theater school

21:10.695 --> 21:12.429
where Patrick Wilson's cousin went.

21:12.530 --> 21:14.668
I... I didn't know him, but...

21:14.731 --> 21:17.105
We really had to produce an actual event

21:17.145 --> 21:19.061
- and then shoot at it.
- [Male Voice] Hold.

21:19.108 --> 21:20.810
I... quit.

21:20.835 --> 21:22.982
[upbeat music]

21:23.007 --> 21:25.842
Hey everybody, welcome to
The Other Show, I'm Sarah.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.034
And I'm Chris.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.368
And we're here talking about episode two

21:28.369 --> 21:30.671
of The Other Two with Drew and Helene.

21:30.672 --> 21:32.115
- Yay!
- Hi!

21:32.140 --> 21:34.341
[everyone talking over each other] Hello.

21:34.342 --> 21:37.044
So this episode is
Chase Goes To A Premiere.

21:37.045 --> 21:38.879
Hey cuties, I'm about
to hit the red carpet

21:38.880 --> 21:39.880
with my manager, Streeter.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.148
Say what's up, Streeter.

21:41.149 --> 21:42.649
Wazzup!

21:42.650 --> 21:44.384
So this episode, a lot
of our season takes place

21:44.385 --> 21:47.221
at big events for Chase and
this is the first one of those

21:47.222 --> 21:49.623
where we had to produce a movie premiere

21:49.624 --> 21:51.325
and then we shot our episode at it.

21:51.326 --> 21:52.860
It was unbelievable.

21:52.861 --> 21:54.228
We just wanted it to feel legitimate,

21:54.229 --> 21:56.864
Because we wanted to
help legitimize Chase

21:56.865 --> 21:59.967
and the world that these
two doofs are entering.

21:59.968 --> 22:02.669
You know how like in
real life, you're gay?

22:02.670 --> 22:03.708
Yes.

22:03.733 --> 22:06.473
Well, the Ad guys loved
that, in fact one of the guys

22:06.474 --> 22:09.465
wanted me to tell you that
his brother is also gay.

22:09.490 --> 22:10.437
Cool?

22:10.462 --> 22:11.845
[Agent] But the thing is,

22:11.846 --> 22:14.081
they think that the
character is straight.

22:14.082 --> 22:15.749
More than 12 years ago
I went in for an audition,

22:15.750 --> 22:17.384
I don't even know what it was for,

22:17.385 --> 22:19.319
but all I had to do,
I didn't have any lines,

22:19.320 --> 22:22.890
I just had to pantomime
laying fertilizer.

22:22.891 --> 22:25.993
I just had to mime laying
fertilizer and say no lines,

22:25.994 --> 22:27.240
and then when I was done they were like,

22:27.265 --> 22:28.396
"That was great, that was great."

22:28.421 --> 22:30.397
So I think this is sort of like,

22:30.398 --> 22:32.933
a suburban guy, think he's got a wife,

22:32.934 --> 22:35.102
so I was trying to get a little more,

22:35.103 --> 22:37.070
basically saying a little straighter

22:37.071 --> 22:38.746
- [Drew laughs]
- without saying it, and I was like,

22:38.771 --> 22:41.690
how do I mime laying
fertilizer straighter?

22:41.715 --> 22:44.426
Though, I can see it was
probably pretty gay.

22:44.451 --> 22:45.351
[everyone laughs]

22:45.376 --> 22:47.080
So I was like, what do I do?

22:47.081 --> 22:49.683
So then I just did it again
but I was sort of like...

22:49.684 --> 22:51.184
[Chris grunts repeatedly]

22:51.185 --> 22:55.122
And I just coughed and cleared
my throat because I was like,

22:55.123 --> 22:58.792
I guess a straight person would
cough more while he did it.

22:58.793 --> 23:00.460
And then I got it and I've
been in those commercials

23:00.461 --> 23:01.895
for years, you've seen it.

23:01.896 --> 23:03.430
[everyone laughs]

23:03.431 --> 23:05.532
It's played for comedy that
you had to re-shoot this

23:05.533 --> 23:07.155
audition and do it less gay...

23:07.179 --> 23:08.560
- Yeah.
- ...but then at the very end

23:08.585 --> 23:11.572
where you feel guilty that you
allowed yourself to do that.

23:11.573 --> 23:15.520
Yeah, you kinda see
Cary sort of dealing with

23:15.577 --> 23:18.378
internalized homophobia at the end

23:18.379 --> 23:20.215
- with the waiter being like,
- Yeah.

23:20.239 --> 23:21.465
he's... he's like...

23:21.490 --> 23:25.682
oh, no, no, no, for me it was
just, they wanted it louder,

23:25.707 --> 23:26.782
you know, and like...

23:26.807 --> 23:27.921
I've dealt with that in real life,

23:27.922 --> 23:30.924
you know, where you're self-hatey.

23:30.925 --> 23:34.494
Being a queer actor,
you're trying to get,

23:34.495 --> 23:38.665
navigate this world that's
a very difficult area

23:38.666 --> 23:41.134
that you make missteps
in and it's like...

23:41.135 --> 23:42.970
Well, it's like, what do
other people want you be?

23:42.971 --> 23:46.106
But then regardless of what
they want, will I allow myself

23:46.107 --> 23:48.731
to change because of
what I think people want?

23:48.756 --> 23:50.942
Yeah. I feel for Cary. I feel like...

23:51.020 --> 23:52.779
to talk about the characters, you know.

23:52.780 --> 23:53.981
I feel for Cary.

23:54.005 --> 23:55.182
But it's like, you know...

23:55.183 --> 23:56.793
He's in like a tough, you know,

23:56.817 --> 23:58.417
because you're like,
oh, I need this money,

23:58.738 --> 23:59.845
Totally, totally.

23:59.870 --> 24:02.956
I'm gonna throw myself out the window.

24:02.957 --> 24:05.192
No, I like that it never
occurred to him when his agent

24:05.193 --> 24:06.527
was like, do it again, less gay.

24:06.528 --> 24:07.861
He's like, okay, that's
what you gotta do

24:07.862 --> 24:09.696
- and then you're like, oh, duh.
- Yeah.

24:09.697 --> 24:12.132
- [Chris groans] It is...
- Yeah.

24:12.133 --> 24:13.367
- ...rough.
- Yeah.

24:13.368 --> 24:14.945
It's so sad!

24:15.537 --> 24:17.771
Your daddy's...

24:17.772 --> 24:18.972
dead!

24:18.973 --> 24:20.841
[Brylyn weeps] Oh, no!

24:20.842 --> 24:21.776
My daddy's dead?

24:21.777 --> 24:23.043
Kate Simses plays Brylyn.

24:23.044 --> 24:24.878
We really, going into casting,

24:24.879 --> 24:26.780
couldn't tell if we should cast young

24:26.781 --> 24:28.749
and make them look older or cast older

24:28.750 --> 24:31.218
and just be like, they're 11.

24:31.219 --> 24:33.387
I guess we didn't know what
was gonna work comedically.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.789
Kate made me laugh so hard,

24:35.790 --> 24:37.391
it was so hard to keep a straight face

24:37.392 --> 24:39.059
when she was going into like,

24:39.060 --> 24:42.229
bursting into tears
about my daddy being dead

24:42.230 --> 24:45.766
and her face was just so,
like she was so deeply,

24:45.767 --> 24:50.003
and even in-between takes,
Kate is such a sweet person

24:50.004 --> 24:52.639
that the whole picture
was just unbelievable.

24:52.640 --> 24:55.309
Yeah, because the idea of
that character is very broad

24:55.310 --> 24:57.244
or almost sketchy so we were trying

24:57.245 --> 24:58.679
to make sure it's still grounded,

24:58.680 --> 25:01.348
but she was so good and like,

25:01.349 --> 25:04.551
so funny but still real even
though it was so preposterous.

25:04.552 --> 25:05.786
She's great, I loved her.

25:05.787 --> 25:07.922
- Brooke, thank God.
- Here.

25:07.923 --> 25:09.790
This party is not fun.

25:09.791 --> 25:10.891
Yes, it is.

25:10.892 --> 25:12.392
I'm having fun.

25:12.393 --> 25:15.429
This episode also has my
favorite unspoken joke in it,

25:15.430 --> 25:18.732
which is: you get
drinks for you and Cary

25:18.733 --> 25:21.869
and you guys meet back
together and you give him

25:21.870 --> 25:24.771
the little pink martini glass
and you drink the whiskey,

25:24.772 --> 25:27.875
which is what Chris and I do
and we often order those things

25:27.876 --> 25:29.343
and then get delivered them opposite

25:29.344 --> 25:31.111
and then we silently switch.

25:31.112 --> 25:34.915
[Male Voice] Ho ho, great party, dude.

25:34.916 --> 25:36.750
It is a great party.

25:36.751 --> 25:38.185
Glad you're having fun, man.

25:38.186 --> 25:39.620
[Male Voice] Oh, I'm...

25:39.621 --> 25:42.089
No, no, I'm uh...

25:42.090 --> 25:43.857
I'm auditioning for a commercial.

25:43.858 --> 25:46.360
The fun thing about
that fart commercial is

25:46.361 --> 25:47.961
this is the third time it's been written

25:47.962 --> 25:50.528
because we tried it
twice at SNL as a sketch.

25:50.553 --> 25:53.100
- Yeah.
- We tried it once with Paul Rudd

25:53.101 --> 25:54.768
and once with Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

25:54.769 --> 25:55.969
It went really well at the table

25:55.970 --> 25:58.539
and then at dress rehearsal it ate shit.

25:58.540 --> 25:59.773
Died.

25:59.774 --> 26:01.808
Because the whole sketch was predicated

26:01.809 --> 26:04.269
on him making very small fart smells,

26:04.294 --> 26:05.979
- Right.
- so it's very subtle and small and just

26:05.980 --> 26:08.382
a huge audience, it's not gonna work.

26:08.383 --> 26:09.783
- Yeah.
- And then we were like, well,

26:09.784 --> 26:10.984
we'll try it again with
Julia Louis-Dreyfus,

26:10.985 --> 26:12.786
and it got pulled, it didn't work again.

26:12.787 --> 26:15.290
And we were like, you know what?
You know what this is missing?

26:15.291 --> 26:16.790
Drew Tarver.

26:16.791 --> 26:17.859
[everyone talking over each other]

26:17.884 --> 26:20.453
Julia couldn't make it.
Paul Rudd couldn't make it work.

26:20.478 --> 26:24.000
[Drew] I make it work.

26:24.062 --> 26:26.343
