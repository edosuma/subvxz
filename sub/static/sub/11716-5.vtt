WEBVTT

00:04.379 --> 00:05.547
Hey, did you water
the living room plant
last night

00:05.589 --> 00:06.882
like I asked?

00:06.924 --> 00:08.509
I didn't water it,
but I did beer it.

00:11.470 --> 00:12.888
Stop pouring beer
in our plants.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.014
Stop buying light beer.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.977
I drink light beer.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.520
That's nothing
to brag about, Sally.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.358
Look, you are not hanging
out with your old buddies
till tomorrow.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.276
You have old buddies?
Who ever liked you?

00:27.903 --> 00:29.738
It's Homecoming weekend
up at Syracuse.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.949
I'm gonna hook up
with the old gang.

00:31.991 --> 00:33.868
Ah. You need someone
to keep an eye on your lady
while you're gone?

00:33.909 --> 00:35.327
Maybe a pair of hands?
Ah!

00:37.329 --> 00:38.664
No. I'm gonna go too.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.958
I'm gonna go
hang out with a few of
my sorority sisters.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.084
Oh, I recently
took in a film with
a very similar plot.

00:45.337 --> 00:46.714
According to this film,
these sorority girls

00:46.755 --> 00:49.299
had quite the adventure
as well.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.759
Well, you'd be
less intrigued
if you saw the size

00:50.801 --> 00:51.677
of Audrey's friends.

00:51.719 --> 00:52.720
Hey!

00:54.388 --> 00:57.057
That is not fair.
Well, except for Danielle.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.475
(LAUGHS)

00:58.517 --> 00:59.434
It's been kind of
rough sledding for her.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.020
No picnic
for the sled either.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.523
You know,
it's been five years

01:04.565 --> 01:05.858
since I've seen
these knuckleheads,

01:06.942 --> 01:08.318
so I'm pretty psyched
for a wild time.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.278
Yeah.
Look out, Syracuse.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.573
White guys in Dockers
with receding hairlines

01:12.614 --> 01:13.782
coming at you!

01:15.617 --> 01:16.911
Speaking
of receding hairlines...

01:16.952 --> 01:18.245
Leave Danielle alone.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.832
Okay, listen.

01:21.874 --> 01:24.083
Just prepare yourselves.
For what?

01:24.125 --> 01:25.627
Oh, I see. Mmm.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.171
(LAUGHS)
Whoa.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.008
Huh?
(GIGGLING)

01:31.926 --> 01:33.427
Guys?
RUSSELL: Yeah.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.887
This is Mambo.
RUSSELL: Cool.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.137
Mambo, these are my friends.
RUSSELL: Yeah.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.974
You look like
a gay pirate.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.518
Wrong.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.562
Pirates have parrots,
whereas I have a cockatoo.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.189
Yeah,
maybe on a slow night.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.945
Please, I beg you.
Just take him home.

01:50.986 --> 01:53.196
Honey, the bonding phase
is crucial in bird ownership.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.907
He's got to get to know me.
I can help him.

01:54.949 --> 01:56.825
Mambo, he's a tool.
Bird's up to speed.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.124
♪ How many ways
to say I love you?

02:07.086 --> 02:09.964
♪ How many ways
to say that I'm not scared

02:11.590 --> 02:16.678
♪ With you by my side
There is no denying

02:16.720 --> 02:19.139
♪ I can't wait
for me and you ♪

02:28.899 --> 02:30.776
Hey, I just found out

02:30.818 --> 02:33.112
there's an anti-fur
PETA protest tonight,

02:33.153 --> 02:34.529
and you and I
are both going.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.197
There's tons
of hot chicks there
with bleeding hearts

02:36.239 --> 02:38.408
under their tasty racks,
right?

02:38.450 --> 02:42.537
So I go find the hottest one,
and then you walk in

02:42.579 --> 02:44.623
right on cue,
wearing this.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.588
No.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.548
Now let me finish.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.510
Then I get all fake outraged,
and I punch you in the face,

02:56.551 --> 02:58.177
and then
the girl's like, "Oh!"

02:58.219 --> 02:59.554
And then I get the hottie.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.518
I think not, sir.
Oh, come on.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.520
I promise I won't hit you
in the glasses this time.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.479
That was a mistake.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.774
For God's sake,
when are you
going to learn

03:10.816 --> 03:12.026
that there's more to life

03:12.067 --> 03:13.944
than the singular pursuit
of tail, sir?

03:13.986 --> 03:15.529
Not anytime soon, I hope.

03:17.238 --> 03:20.117
You're right.
Your priorities
are unimpeachable.

03:20.159 --> 03:22.828
"Oh, I'm Timmy.
I know big words
about peaches."

03:24.830 --> 03:25.956
Sir...

03:26.623 --> 03:27.833
As it turns out,

03:28.876 --> 03:30.585
I'm already going
somewhere tonight

03:30.627 --> 03:32.796
where there are
lots of single ladies
eager for company.

03:32.838 --> 03:35.298
Oh! Share the wealth.
Hook a player up, brother.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.635
All right.
Won't you join me?

03:38.677 --> 03:40.137
I'm in.

03:40.179 --> 03:42.181
If it doesn't work out,
we always got plan "B."

03:42.222 --> 03:44.058
"Hey, look at you."
Doosh-doosh-doosh.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.475
"Oh, my hero."

03:56.111 --> 03:58.113
Raiding the mini-bar?
That's not like you.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.614
I'm in 314.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.449
A bottle of vodka's
missing from the mini-bar.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.160
I didn't want you
to charge us for it.

04:03.202 --> 04:04.411
That's like you.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.788
Just wetting my whistle.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.665
Not like I see
these animals every day.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.751
When we get together,
it's crazy.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.255
There's nobody in the world
I'd rather spend time with
than these guys.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.049
Huh. Always nice
for a wife to hear.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.509
Well, can't you have fun
with them sober?

04:20.510 --> 04:22.054
I guess
we'll never find out.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.597
(LAUGHS) Well,
you go have your fun.

04:23.638 --> 04:24.806
But when you get back,

04:24.848 --> 04:26.266
do not climb
on top of me naked.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.393
I didn't hear
any complaints last time.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.728
Well, it's a little
hard to talk

04:29.770 --> 04:32.522
with a mouthful
of chest hair.

04:32.564 --> 04:35.400
So you're saying that
perhaps the obligatory
hotel sex

04:35.442 --> 04:38.237
should happen now.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.572
No. I'm on my way
to meet my...

04:42.407 --> 04:43.867
All right, fine.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.786
But let's make
this quick, okay?

04:45.827 --> 04:46.787
I've got my...

04:51.708 --> 04:52.751
Roger that.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.511
Uh, Tim,
some of these chicks

05:03.553 --> 05:05.222
are a little long
in the tooth.

05:05.264 --> 05:08.767
Um, what sort of
nightclub is this?

05:10.602 --> 05:13.521
It's a retirement home, sir.
I come here once a week.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.065
Wow,
you're into some stuff.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.191
Kinky.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.655
I don't attempt
to have sex with them.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.865
Oh, I get it.
You make them
come to you.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.826
Yeah.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.953
I wouldn't wait too long,
not a big shelf life here.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.040
I volunteer
and spend time with them.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.333
Oh.
Well, why am I here?

05:34.293 --> 05:36.795
Because I'm issuing you
a challenge.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.089
I want you to spend
one evening helping others,

05:39.131 --> 05:41.591
rather than tending
to your own carnal needs.

05:41.633 --> 05:44.511
Right. But then
what about my carnal needs?

05:46.345 --> 05:49.224
Sir, I'm just trying
to help make you
a better person.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.018
My intentions here
are pure.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.978
(SIGHS)
You know what isn't pure?
The air in here.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.229
It's like a giant diaper.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.904
You did it. You did it.
Good bird. Good bird. Here.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.489
Jen?

06:04.531 --> 06:05.991
Jen, get in here.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.534
Can it wait?
No!

06:08.118 --> 06:09.161
No, I need you.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.538
What is it?

06:13.874 --> 06:14.666
Are you sitting down?

06:16.001 --> 06:17.961
You see I'm standing.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.378
What's going on?

06:19.420 --> 06:22.841
Okay. Mambo just ate
a peanut out of my mouth.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.510
Huh?
That's what couldn't wait?

06:26.636 --> 06:27.595
No, honey, honey.
Check it out.

06:27.637 --> 06:28.722
Check it out,
check it out.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.431
All right, watch this.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.809
Good boy.
Let's do it again.

06:32.851 --> 06:33.601
Let's do it again.
(MIMICKING CHIRP)

06:33.643 --> 06:34.602
No? No?

06:36.855 --> 06:38.690
God, I knew
I should have
recorded it.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.234
Damn it,
trust your instincts, Adam!

06:41.318 --> 06:43.070
Why would you want
to record that?

06:43.111 --> 06:44.529
You know
those sweet YouTube vids

06:44.571 --> 06:46.865
of animals
doing awesome stuff?

06:46.907 --> 06:47.908
Well, I could have made
one of those.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.910
I mean,
they get tons of hits.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.828
What does it matter
if some strangers
on the internet

06:51.870 --> 06:52.871
see your bird
do a trick?

06:54.039 --> 06:55.582
Boy, could you
not get it less?

06:57.667 --> 06:59.961
Honey, we're living
in a golden age
of unearned fame.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.672
People achieve celebrity
for the most
ridiculous reasons.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.549
Yes, and it's
desperate and pathetic.

07:04.591 --> 07:05.424
And I want in on it.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.975
May I help you?
Uh, yes.

07:14.017 --> 07:17.687
Just joining some of
my old dearest friends.

07:17.729 --> 07:20.399
Holy crap,
I hardly even recognized
you fat bastards.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.734
I didn't think
it was possible,

07:22.776 --> 07:24.194
but you guys got
even uglier.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.197
Hey, Jeff!
We're over here!

07:33.703 --> 07:34.829
I'm sorry, fellas.
Enjoy your meal.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.000
(LAUGHTER)
How you doing?

07:39.042 --> 07:40.127
How are you?

07:40.168 --> 07:41.420
Jimmer!
Jeff!

07:41.461 --> 07:43.297
All right, Rudy.
What's up, buddy?

07:43.338 --> 07:44.505
Listen, I'm sorry
I'm a little late.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.799
I was nailing
Jimmer's mom

07:45.840 --> 07:47.092
in the alley
behind the Quiznos.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.509
(LAUGHTER)

07:48.551 --> 07:50.304
You're too cheap,
you'd never pay for that.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.264
Mom is not
a prostitute.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.473
Oh, she just gives it away
for free, huh?

07:53.514 --> 07:55.892
(LAUGHTER)

07:55.934 --> 07:57.394
It's great
to see you guys.
Yeah.

07:57.436 --> 07:59.938
Here's to this being
the last thing
we remember tonight.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.148
(CHUCKLES)

08:06.236 --> 08:07.404
Aah!

08:10.490 --> 08:12.284
You guys are
embarrassing yourselves.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.995
(LAUGHING)

08:15.036 --> 08:16.413
But it wasn't all bad.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.081
Jimmer still got
a Snickers bar
and a pat on the head.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.459
(LAUGHTER)

08:20.500 --> 08:22.085
So are you gentlemen
ready to order?

08:22.127 --> 08:23.462
Well, let's just
make this easy.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.880
Why don't you bring us
your finest cow
and four plates?

08:25.922 --> 08:28.467
Actually, I'll just have
the broiled salmon.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.801
Salmon. Does that
come with a skirt?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.471
Bingo,
he had a heart attack.

08:32.512 --> 08:33.972
That was, like,
six months ago.

08:35.474 --> 08:36.891
I'm gonna go
with the petite filet.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.435
Petite filet.
Boo.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.021
My cholesterol's
a little high.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.439
I'm watching what I eat.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.816
Oh, please, on a bet,
you once ate a pound
of drywall.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.362
Rudy, tell me
you're having a real steak.

08:48.403 --> 08:50.364
Actually, Barb and I
are vegetarians now.

08:50.405 --> 08:51.406
Is there anything
without meat in it?

08:51.448 --> 08:53.033
Yeah, your underwear.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.795
Lovely Ruth,
this is Mr. Dunbar.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.464
Mr. Dunbar,
my friend Ruth.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.050
Friend?
You mean sister.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.179
I can't believe
I'm wasting my rap
on oldie Hawn.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.307
We're going to play
some gin. Ruth...

09:17.349 --> 09:18.725
All right.

09:18.766 --> 09:21.102
Would you like to deal?
Oh, well, sure.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.357
(SIGHS)

09:28.235 --> 09:29.403
Yeesh.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.322
Later that same night...

09:35.700 --> 09:37.618
Can you please
just try to find
one positive thing

09:37.660 --> 09:38.703
about being here?
I doubt it.

09:39.746 --> 09:40.872
Whoa.
Here we go.

09:43.208 --> 09:46.503
Hey, I'm Russell.
Hi. I'm Caroline.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.505
This is my friend Esther.
Oh, friend?

09:48.547 --> 09:49.839
You must mean sister.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.135
I'm just throwing her a bone.
She's, like, a million.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.098
Are you
one of the volunteers?

09:58.139 --> 10:00.100
Sounds like you missed
the orientation.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.684
Ah, maybe
we should hit happy hour.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.562
You can catch me up
over a couple of cocktails.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.525
I'm working.
Not as hard as I am.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.277
Come on.
Meet me halfway on this.

10:10.318 --> 10:13.071
Excuse me.
I'm helping someone.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.490
Listen, just push her
in front of the fish tank

10:15.532 --> 10:16.824
and tell her
she's at SeaWorld.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.663
Really?
Yeah, so he woke up
just covered in puke.

10:22.705 --> 10:23.540
What are you
talking about, Jimmer?

10:23.582 --> 10:26.000
Tomorrow morning?

10:26.042 --> 10:28.336
No, my son Ryan,
he's got a bit of
a stomach virus.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.464
Now we all agree,
no talk about
work or family.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.048
We didn't agree.
You just said that.

10:34.092 --> 10:37.178
I stand by it.
Now I got us some shots
to tide us over

10:37.220 --> 10:38.846
until the waitress brings
the shots that I ordered.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.351
Actually, I'm just gonna
get a cup of coffee.
Me too.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.979
I wonder
if they have herbal tea.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.856
Am I crazy,
or did you guys all
just come out?

10:50.817 --> 10:53.194
Good one, Bingo,
but I gotta get up
early and drive.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.071
It's Izzy's ballet recital.
Here, check it out.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.115
Here she is in her tutu.
Oh, she's adorable.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.658
That's so cute.
Let me see that.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.951
Power off.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.953
Okay, we've got to focus.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.413
We've gotta get over
to Thirsty Charlie's

11:03.455 --> 11:04.705
if we're gonna
get a table.

11:04.747 --> 11:07.000
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna pass.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.251
Yeah, me too.
I'm exhausted.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.961
Unbelievable!

11:11.963 --> 11:13.632
All right, Dave,
all these gals are
gonna go home

11:13.672 --> 11:15.008
and braid
each other's hair,

11:15.049 --> 11:17.469
so I guess
it's just you and me.

11:18.595 --> 11:19.762
I don't know, Bingham.

11:19.804 --> 11:20.847
You know,
with the heart medicine,

11:20.888 --> 11:22.307
my doctor says
I should take it easy.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.558
I've known you
for 25 years.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.643
Who are you
gonna listen to,
him or me?

11:26.978 --> 11:29.147
I guess I could
go for one.
That a boy!

11:29.189 --> 11:30.649
All right, well,
me and the madman

11:30.689 --> 11:33.109
are gonna go add
another chapter
to the legend.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.612
(LAUGHS) All right, Bingo.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

11:37.780 --> 11:38.823
Hey, honey.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.368
Will do.
Sorry, Jeff, gotta go.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.494
No!

11:47.499 --> 11:49.209
Oh, do you not
want these anymore?

11:49.250 --> 11:50.460
No, I do.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.340
Bird eats peanut
in coolest way ever.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.509
Okay, Mambo, ready?
No. Not yet.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.469
Let's get famous.
Ready? Come here.

12:00.303 --> 12:01.720
Come on.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.390
Come on, dude,
get your head in the game!

12:04.432 --> 12:05.517
(SIGHS)

12:06.351 --> 12:07.352
Oh.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.689
Oh. Oh, great.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.524
Yeah, great.
Bird eats peanut in...

12:12.566 --> 12:14.025
(CRACKING)

12:14.067 --> 12:15.652
Most stupid,
boring way ever.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.737
Zero hits.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.334
Sir, what on earth
are you doing?

12:31.376 --> 12:33.378
I'm throwing up bricks here
like Shaquille.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.131
I'm gonna be
sore tomorrow,
I can feel it.

12:38.675 --> 12:42.262
I challenged you to help,
but clearly you're incapable.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.804
I don't get any credit
for feeding this one?

12:45.724 --> 12:47.100
Look, I could help
if I wanted to.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.142
Okay. Prove it.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.937
That's Stella.

12:50.978 --> 12:53.022
She likes to go for a walk
around the building every day.

12:53.064 --> 12:53.898
You could join her.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.651
Piece of cake.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.194
Stella, come on,
let's do this.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.538
(SIGHS)

13:11.291 --> 13:13.668
Whoa. Stella!
Come on, where's the fire?

13:13.710 --> 13:15.002
Can I get a hit of that?

13:15.044 --> 13:16.463
Aah! One more.

13:17.046 --> 13:17.964
Thanks.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.473
Hey.
Oh, hey.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.183
What are you doing here?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.477
Shouldn't you still be out
with your friends,

13:30.518 --> 13:31.311
throwing up
on each other?

13:33.187 --> 13:34.314
I wish.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.857
Aw. What happened?

13:37.692 --> 13:39.360
The guys are all lame now.

13:39.402 --> 13:42.029
I mean, it's tragic.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.990
They used to be real pervs
and binge drinkers.

13:46.618 --> 13:49.746
Tonight all I did was
talk about their kids
and cholesterol.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.374
How was ladies' night?

13:53.416 --> 13:55.418
Well, pretty much the same.

13:55.460 --> 13:58.588
I was really looking
forward to it,

13:58.630 --> 14:02.300
but all they talked about
was strollers and preschools
and Rogaine.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.635
Rogaine?
Which husband?

14:04.636 --> 14:05.804
No, it's Danielle.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.476
Things are not
getting better there.

14:12.935 --> 14:13.978
That's gonna be us,
isn't it?

14:14.937 --> 14:16.523
No.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.483
We're better than that.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.777
I thought my buddies were too,
but Rudy ordered a salad

14:20.819 --> 14:22.069
with dressing on the side,
so...

14:24.364 --> 14:25.532
I punched him
in the balls.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.660
And he actually got mad.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.164
Didn't he just have
hernia surgery?

14:35.124 --> 14:36.250
No, that's next week.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.377
Whatever.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.172
I guess
it's all over for us.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.007
No, it doesn't
have to be.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.051
Well, how do you figure?
We're gonna be parents soon.

14:45.092 --> 14:47.345
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
we have to be lame.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.723
We can have our own fun.

14:49.764 --> 14:50.931
Well, I appreciate that, Aud.

14:52.517 --> 14:53.810
But I'm kind of bloated,
maybe if you're on top.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.395
No...

14:57.814 --> 14:59.649
No! I mean, let's go out.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.568
Really?

15:01.609 --> 15:03.152
Yeah! You wanted
to hit Thirsty Charlie's.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.696
Let's do it. Come on.
All right, let's do it.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.115
Hey, I wonder
if my jock strap's

15:08.157 --> 15:10.201
still up there
on those moose antlers.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.162
Mmm. If it's not,
I'm gonna buy a beer

15:13.204 --> 15:14.247
for whoever
had to take it down.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.921
Ah, Mr. Dunbar.
I just saw Stella.

15:23.130 --> 15:25.216
She said she had
a wonderful walk with you.

15:25.258 --> 15:28.094
I hope
it finally felt good...
Yes, Timmy.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.054
Helping people
certainly does feel good.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.141
As I've often said,
my heart is my
second biggest organ.

15:36.519 --> 15:37.604
Reprehensible.

15:38.646 --> 15:39.564
Oh, hey, Caroline.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.066
You couldn't help
but overhear

15:42.108 --> 15:44.110
Timmy praising
my selflessness...

15:44.151 --> 15:45.695
(CHUCKLES)

15:45.737 --> 15:47.822
Which incidentally
spills over
into the bedroom.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.825
Yeah.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.034
Some of the residents
have complained about

15:52.076 --> 15:53.327
the smell of your cologne.

15:54.704 --> 15:55.914
What?
The smell of my cologne?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.582
Are you kidding me?

15:57.624 --> 15:59.626
Stella's breath is like
a punch in the face!

16:05.047 --> 16:08.593
You're in a place
where you could
actually do some good.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.762
But you can't...
Right, right, right.

16:10.804 --> 16:14.181
Because you're incapable
of thinking beyond your
perverse sexual appetite.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.558
Up high.
Not up high.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.269
Sir, there's someone
you need to meet.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.439
That's Herman.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.525
Never married.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.277
Never bothered with
meaningful connections
with others.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.612
Yeah.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.655
Now he spends
all his days alone,

16:28.696 --> 16:29.447
just sitting
in that corner.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.784
Yuck.

16:32.826 --> 16:33.868
Yuck indeed, sir.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.329
And that is your future

16:36.370 --> 16:38.539
unless you make
some serious changes
in your life.

16:39.916 --> 16:40.959
Okay.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.423
Hey, Herm,
I'm Russell.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.760
Timmy says
you're pretty much
alone, huh?

16:50.802 --> 16:52.595
Yeah, pretty much.
Pretty much.

16:52.637 --> 16:54.388
Pretty much.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.975
In fact, I happen
to be the only man
living in this place...

16:58.309 --> 16:59.644
That he is.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.855
Which gives me the pick
of all the ladies.

17:01.896 --> 17:02.814
(CHUCKLES)

17:04.524 --> 17:06.066
Exactly... What now?

17:08.402 --> 17:12.323
Well, I had her,
and last week,
I nailed her.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.324
(CHUCKLES)

17:14.826 --> 17:16.619
Seriously?
Sweet Ruth?

17:16.661 --> 17:20.164
Oh, she may be sweet,
but she's filthy. Whoa!

17:23.292 --> 17:26.004
As a matter of fact,
I don't even need
this wheelchair.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.589
Only reason I'm here
is because I'm exhausted.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.301
Herminator!

17:32.343 --> 17:34.220
You're crushing it,
dude, I love it.

17:34.261 --> 17:36.347
Herman,
it's sponge bath time.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.182
Sponge bath?
Oh, good.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.309
Why don't we
give me one first?
(LAUGHS)

17:42.436 --> 17:43.521
Oh!

17:45.899 --> 17:47.025
(WHISTLES)

17:48.735 --> 17:50.486
That guy's
the coolest guy
I ever met.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.031
Thanks for the lesson,
Timmy.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.324
Hey, Ruth, didn't know
you were such an animal.

17:55.366 --> 17:56.242
Deal me in.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.797
This is it.
He's gonna do it.

Oh, my God,
are you okay?

18:16.387 --> 18:18.681
Yeah! Yeah! Help me!
Okay.

18:39.326 --> 18:43.414
Well, that was impressive.
(LAUGHS)

18:43.456 --> 18:45.332
How do you know
all those Jay-Z songs?

18:45.374 --> 18:48.377
Huh? Am I more fun than
your boring friends or what?

18:48.419 --> 18:51.380
You are.
And you made
tonight great,

18:51.422 --> 18:52.715
and I believe you.

18:52.757 --> 18:53.967
Having a kid is not
gonna make us boring.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.134
Aw!

18:57.804 --> 18:58.930
(BURPS)

19:01.599 --> 19:03.309
Fair enough.
Mmm.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.727
Never been
on this end of it before.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.354
Uh, what do you say
we head back to our room?

19:08.272 --> 19:10.108
What, back to the hotel?

19:10.149 --> 19:11.275
What, do you need
to change your panties?

19:12.359 --> 19:13.569
What?
Come on.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.529
Sack up, bingo!

19:15.905 --> 19:16.948
Ow!
Oh!

19:16.990 --> 19:18.240

19:19.742 --> 19:21.911
We are not done here,
mmm-mmm.

19:21.953 --> 19:23.913
Audrey,
this is good, but...

19:23.955 --> 19:25.289
Come on now,
what would you be
doing right now

19:25.331 --> 19:26.582
if you were
with your guys, huh?

19:26.624 --> 19:28.042
Probably talking about
my wife's drinking problem.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.086
(LAUGHS) This guy.

19:30.128 --> 19:32.922
Come on, Bingham!
What's next?

19:32.964 --> 19:34.966
Well, we sort of had
this tradition of taking
our shirts off

19:35.008 --> 19:36.509
and jumping
in the fountain,

19:36.550 --> 19:37.301
but we really
don't have to...

19:39.137 --> 19:41.180
Last one in the fountain
is a loser!

19:41.221 --> 19:42.431
(CHEERING)

19:43.933 --> 19:45.184

how's the hangover?

20:14.338 --> 20:16.215
(GROANS)

20:16.256 --> 20:17.925
I gotta go home
and take a nap.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.886
Aw.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.220
Those other two naps
must have made her tired.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.847
(LAUGHS)

20:22.889 --> 20:25.975
So what did
you guys do exactly?

20:26.017 --> 20:28.686
Oh, Aud wanted to
prove that we weren't
going to be boring

20:28.728 --> 20:30.270
just because
we're having a kid,

20:30.312 --> 20:31.689
which she did
by getting wasted

20:31.731 --> 20:33.482
and dancing topless
in a fountain.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.526
Oh, topless, huh?
Jen, may I?

20:38.487 --> 20:41.365

What are you waiting for?
100,000 hits?

20:48.622 --> 20:49.874
No thanks, I'm good.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.834
This isn't half as good

20:51.876 --> 20:53.627

20:54.128 --> 20:55.629
Watch.

20:55.671 --> 20:56.589
