12:02.790 --> 12:04.057
-Oh, yes, she is.
-Why?

12:04.958 --> 12:06.794
Because she lets
you call her "Mother"

12:06.827 --> 12:08.128
instead of "Master"?

12:09.396 --> 12:11.331

13:02.282 --> 13:03.783
after she went to sleep,

any Doll on Wall Street,

13:16.496 --> 13:18.065

ever, ever again.

from the kitchen.

waiting to plunge it

I heard him knock.

But the knock never came.

14:24.431 --> 14:25.933
The next morning,

14:26.934 --> 14:28.201
The Widow asked me
to forgive her

14:28.235 --> 14:29.502
for not killing him sooner.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.273
That was the kindest
thing that

14:33.306 --> 14:34.641
anyone had ever done for me.

and meant it.

Don't you let some crush
cloud your good judgment,

16:00.060 --> 16:01.961

can get you killed.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.165

just starting to like you.

-All right!

23:48.561 --> 23:49.629
All right.

23:50.497 --> 23:51.531
They're Abbots.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.600
They are single-minded
and crazy

23:53.633 --> 23:54.867
and they are very dangerous.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.803
-Give me the keys.
-What did I just tell you?

23:57.269 --> 23:58.871
They have my friend. A boy.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.540
Well, we'll get you
another boy.

24:00.573 --> 24:01.641

Come on. Come on.

I'm not going to the Wall

25:04.270 --> 25:05.271
Oh...

25:39.806 --> 25:40.640

they were celebrating?

25:41.908 --> 25:42.909
No idea.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.178
The Old World had
a lot of strange rituals.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.685
Do you think they knew
it was coming?

25:54.020 --> 25:55.021
Who?

25:56.388 --> 25:57.857

built this place.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.729
Do you think they knew
it was all gonna end?

26:05.765 --> 26:07.900
Master says that nothing
ever truly ends.

26:09.669 --> 26:12.905
"The whole world is an
endless cycle of rebirths."

26:22.915 --> 26:23.916

26:28.655 --> 26:30.089
I don't have a Master anymore.

26:34.326 --> 26:35.695

26:44.704 --> 26:46.138

26:59.986 --> 27:00.987
I don't even remember

27:01.020 --> 27:02.054

27:05.124 --> 27:06.859
There's worse things
than not remembering.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.296
What do you mean?

27:15.902 --> 27:17.737
You really wanna know what
I saw in those mirrors?

27:22.008 --> 27:23.109
I saw my mom.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.881
I held her in my arms
as she died.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.186
(WHISPERS) I killed her.

27:39.926 --> 27:41.127
I killed her, Ava.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.996
The Master says those visions

27:44.030 --> 27:45.732
can't always be trusted.

27:45.765 --> 27:46.899
Master's wrong.

27:48.334 --> 27:49.668

one of my guards.

28:58.805 --> 29:00.372
how did you find my bunker?

29:01.040 --> 29:02.208
WALDO: With due respect,

29:03.509 --> 29:05.344
you're not as clever
as you think.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.546
You never were.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.982
You tracked me down
all by yourself, did you?

29:10.883 --> 29:12.184
You're not bad
for an old cripple.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.153
Maybe if you'd listened
to me once in a while,

29:14.186 --> 29:16.188
you wouldn't be living like
a roach in a hole.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.424
I'd keep a very close eye
on this one if I was you.

29:20.026 --> 29:21.994
Now... What do you want?

29:22.528 --> 29:23.529

29:28.534 --> 29:31.003

neither can you.

29:32.038 --> 29:33.139
But together...

29:34.206 --> 29:37.309
The other Barons would
never suspect an alliance.

29:38.010 --> 29:40.546
And when it's just the two
of us left standing?

29:41.948 --> 29:45.117

to kill me before I kill you.

30:19.251 --> 30:20.486

30:22.288 --> 30:23.289
But first...

30:25.591 --> 30:27.326
I need Veil and her boy.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.561
I don't know what you mean.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.299
Well, Waldo did not
find me himself.

to either of them.

30:43.442 --> 30:44.843
You just give me what's mine,

and I'll agree
to your confederacy.

-Oh.

30:59.491 --> 31:00.960
