WEBVTT

00:02.633 --> 00:04.767
-* Doo-wop, doo-wop

00:04.800 --> 00:06.467
-Hey, sunshine.

00:07.467 --> 00:08.533
How are you?

00:08.567 --> 00:11.400
Are you okay?
Are you-- are you good?

00:11.433 --> 00:14.467
-I wanted to ask you
if you think me getting

00:14.500 --> 00:17.333
an abortion is definitely
the right decision,

00:17.367 --> 00:21.200
because I know that
you and I have talked

00:21.233 --> 00:23.833
about raising kids, and--
and I know that it's-- it's big.

00:23.867 --> 00:27.300
It's a big thing.
But, like, I don't know,

00:27.333 --> 00:32.400
maybe-- maybe we could, like,
keep it and raise it together.

00:35.533 --> 00:36.733
-Yes, jokes.

00:36.767 --> 00:38.667
Okay, you're making funny jokes.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.433
Good. Fine.

00:40.467 --> 00:44.767
-I'm not joking.
I'm being totally serious.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.233
And now you're making
me feel really weird about it.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.733
-Okay.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.100
-Why won't you laugh?

00:53.133 --> 00:54.300
-I've kept it
a very good secret.

00:54.333 --> 00:56.733
Nobody knows. Don't worry.
I really am a very good helper.

00:56.767 --> 00:57.633
-(door opens)

00:57.667 --> 01:00.300
-I'm really nervous
about the dentist.

01:00.333 --> 01:01.533
-Not the dentist!

01:01.567 --> 01:02.633
-He's gonna hurt my mouth.

01:02.667 --> 01:04.600
-Mm, yeah.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.600
-Arnold's surprisingly calm
about the trial sleepover

01:09.633 --> 01:11.167
at his parents' house.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.700
That's all pretty
fucking weird, yeah?

01:12.733 --> 01:14.200
-Arnold:
I can hear you, Tom!

01:14.233 --> 01:15.533
-Well, it is weird!

01:15.567 --> 01:17.267
-Arnold:
You want to know
what else is weird?

01:17.300 --> 01:19.067
Your confidence levels!

01:19.100 --> 01:20.767
-I don't come across
as confident, do I?

01:20.800 --> 01:24.600
-Um, Claire's ill, so I'm going
to take her to the doctor today.

01:24.633 --> 01:28.067
-Is it contagious?
-(Claire and Josh laugh)

01:28.100 --> 01:29.500
-* One, two

01:29.533 --> 01:31.300
* One, two, three, four

01:31.333 --> 01:33.100
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

01:33.133 --> 01:35.800
* Yeah, I'll be fine,
yeah, yeah *

01:35.833 --> 01:38.267
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

01:38.300 --> 01:39.733
* Oh, yeah, here

01:39.767 --> 01:41.533
* Oh, the good Lord knows it

01:41.567 --> 01:42.600
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

01:42.633 --> 01:44.267
* Oh, the good Lord knows it

01:44.300 --> 01:45.400
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

01:45.433 --> 01:48.633
* I left better behind
to be fine *

01:48.667 --> 01:50.533
* Yeah, yeah, fine

01:50.567 --> 01:53.400
* Make my mama
turn another blind eye *

01:53.433 --> 01:55.333
* Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah *

01:55.367 --> 01:58.033
* I left better behind
to be fine *

01:59.767 --> 02:01.567
-Oh, I can't believe
he's leaving us.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.533
-He learned to use
the washing machine
and now he's off.

02:03.567 --> 02:05.267
-We've not done enough
for you, apparently.

02:05.300 --> 02:06.500
-You've all been
very good to me,

02:06.533 --> 02:09.567
but now it's time I went out
and stood on my own two feet.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.300
-At your parents' mansion.
-Mm-hmm.

02:11.333 --> 02:12.733
-Are those two feet
standing exclusively

02:12.767 --> 02:15.700
on a rug woven from the hair
of beautiful Swedish people?

02:15.733 --> 02:16.800
-Yes.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.100
Bye.

02:19.133 --> 02:20.633
-Good luck!

02:20.667 --> 02:23.167
-* Doo-wop, doo-wop

02:23.200 --> 02:25.500
* Doo-wop, doo-wop

02:25.533 --> 02:28.200
* Doo-wop, doo-wop
-Thank you.

02:28.233 --> 02:30.267
-Why did you take one?

02:30.300 --> 02:32.400
-To be polite?
-Idiot.

02:32.433 --> 02:34.167
-(chuckles)

02:34.200 --> 02:36.167
A lot of spelling mistakes.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.567
-Yeah?
-They spelled "fetus"
four different ways

02:38.600 --> 02:39.667
on this page alone.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.267
-Well, which is
the correct one?

02:42.567 --> 02:44.067
-F-E-T-U-S.

02:44.100 --> 02:45.067
-Isn't there an "O"?

02:45.100 --> 02:46.800
-F-E-O-T-U-S?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.567
-F-E-O-U-...
-F-O-U-...

02:48.600 --> 02:50.067
-F-O-- F-O-E...

02:50.100 --> 02:51.333
-I just have no idea.

02:51.367 --> 02:53.133
-Why don't we know this?
-(buzzes)

02:53.167 --> 02:54.500
-Woman:
Hello?

02:54.533 --> 02:56.767
-Hi, this is Claire.
I have an appointment.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.367
-I'll be there in a moment.

03:00.333 --> 03:02.267
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

03:02.300 --> 03:03.700
I just hate doctors,
that's all.

03:03.733 --> 03:07.333
I am very excited
to exercise my right

03:07.367 --> 03:09.800
to decide what happens
to my body today.

03:09.833 --> 03:11.467
-You look very pretty.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.033
-Thank you.
-What do I do with this?

03:13.067 --> 03:14.233
-Hide it!

03:14.267 --> 03:15.667
Hello.
-Hi.

03:15.700 --> 03:17.167
-Thank you.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.333
-Woman:
Claire?

03:25.700 --> 03:27.100
Oh, we just need Claire.

03:27.133 --> 03:28.767
-Okay.
-He can't come?

03:28.800 --> 03:31.267
-We just need you to meet
with the doctor initially
on your own.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.600
You can stay here for now.

03:32.633 --> 03:33.800
-Okay.

03:35.300 --> 03:37.433
-Ooh.
-Yeah, okay,
I shouldn't have winked.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.800
I-- I panicked.
-Stop.

03:43.300 --> 03:46.267
-(whispering) Oh, my God.
I hate the dentist.

03:47.467 --> 03:49.500
(whispering)
-Yeah, it's the worst.
-Mm.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.467
-Why's it so quiet?
-I don't know.

03:55.533 --> 03:58.400
-(groans)
Oh, God.

03:58.433 --> 04:01.267
You're lying there,
the chair's all back

04:01.300 --> 04:03.100
and you can't go anywhere.

04:03.133 --> 04:06.567
The man comes in
with the rubbery fingers
in your mouth

04:06.600 --> 04:08.600
and they're all squeaking
against your teeth.

04:08.633 --> 04:11.100
He's just...
he's just in there.

04:11.133 --> 04:14.500
Like, he's just too far in.
His fingers are too far in.

04:14.533 --> 04:16.600
Your teeth aren't that far in.

04:16.633 --> 04:19.367
Your mouth's just always open
and you can't swallow

04:19.400 --> 04:21.267
and he's got that sucky thing.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.633
You know, and he only
uses it at the last second,

04:23.667 --> 04:25.100
so you always feel like
you're gonna drown.

04:25.133 --> 04:28.200
Do you think they'd let me
come in and be in charge
of your sucky thing?

04:28.233 --> 04:29.667
-I don't...
I don't think so.

04:29.700 --> 04:32.700
-Oh, God! And that
sharp, pricky thing.

04:32.733 --> 04:35.833
You know that awful,
sharp, pricky hooky thing?

04:35.867 --> 04:37.800
Like, that scrapy hooky thing?

04:37.833 --> 04:40.733
You know, in between
the... it's like a scrapy--

04:40.767 --> 04:43.367
-Oh my God, shut up! Shut up.
-Oh my God,
I'm in a real state now.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.767
-I'm in a state now.
-No, I'm serious.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.367
I'm actually quite anxious.
I'm all hot.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.200
Why'd you bring
me with you?

04:49.233 --> 04:51.233
-I didn't bring you with me.
You just came.

04:51.267 --> 04:53.700
-Well, you know
I can't be by myself.

04:57.467 --> 04:58.767
-Woman:
I've got Claire for you.

05:04.433 --> 05:08.633
-(phone rings)

05:08.667 --> 05:10.433
(whispers)
-Hi, Mum. Just a sec.
Just a sec--

05:10.467 --> 05:11.767
-Rose (shouting):
Stuart's cheating on me!

05:11.800 --> 05:13.467
He's cheating on me!

05:13.500 --> 05:15.833
-(door rattles)
-Just push the button.

05:15.867 --> 05:17.433
-Joshua, did you hear
what I said?

05:17.467 --> 05:19.333
-Thank you.

05:19.367 --> 05:20.667
I'm sorry, what was
happening with Stuart?

05:20.700 --> 05:22.100
-Stuart's with Hazel.

05:22.133 --> 05:23.667
He's cheating on me.

05:23.700 --> 05:24.500
-Hazel is his wife.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.067
Stuart's not cheating
on you, Mum.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.167
He-- he's cheating with you.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.233
-Oh, that-- that's not
the right thing to say, Josh.

05:30.267 --> 05:32.567
Now you say you're sorry
because my feelings are hurt.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.267
-Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
You're right.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.500
I was distracted.
I'm sorry. Sorry.

05:35.533 --> 05:38.567
-No, no, I don't give a shit.
Fuck Stuart.
-Okay.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.067
Fine. Fuck Stuart.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.633
How come-- Why do you think
he was cheating?

05:41.667 --> 05:43.433
-Well, 'cause I read his texts.

05:43.467 --> 05:46.133
And he's-- he asked her
to pick up oats.

05:46.167 --> 05:47.733
That's married.
It's so married, Josh.

05:47.767 --> 05:49.267
-Well, I hope you're not
reading my texts.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.800
-Look, I'm plotting revenge.
I want you to come over
'cause you're clever.

05:51.833 --> 05:54.067
-No, no, I can't.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.167
-No, come on.
I want to get him. Please.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.533
-I just-- I can't, okay?

05:57.567 --> 05:59.367
-Come on!
-I just can't!

05:59.400 --> 06:01.300
-Oh, you're no fucking fun!

06:01.333 --> 06:02.700
-(buzz)
-Hi.

06:02.733 --> 06:04.767
Um, this is Josh.
I was just in there with Claire.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.300
-Woman: Do you have
an appointment?
-Yeah.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.567
I have an appointment
with Claire.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.067
Yeah, it's just that--
There was a different nurse.

06:11.100 --> 06:13.500
-I'll buzz you in.
-(buzz)

06:13.533 --> 06:15.367
-(knocking)
-(door opening)

06:15.400 --> 06:17.200
-This is Josh.

06:18.467 --> 06:19.533
-Hi.
-Hi, Josh.

06:21.667 --> 06:23.633
-Uh, they wanted
to pull me aside

06:23.667 --> 06:25.767
to make sure you weren't
forcing me to have an abortion.

06:25.800 --> 06:26.833
-Wow.

06:26.867 --> 06:29.500
That paints a dark picture
of the world we live in.

06:29.533 --> 06:31.733
I know. Imagine you forcing
me to do anything. Look at you.

06:31.767 --> 06:35.133
-I could force, thank you.
I'm tough. I'm quite tough.

06:35.167 --> 06:37.167
-Big, tough man.
Good on you.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.367
-Thank you.
-(scoffs)

06:40.533 --> 06:42.367
-Uh, how was the ultrasound?

06:42.400 --> 06:46.400
-Well, there is a baby in me,
which is pretty fucking weird.

06:46.433 --> 06:48.033
-Gosh.

06:48.067 --> 06:49.600
Wh-- what now?

06:49.633 --> 06:52.433
-Well, Claire has opted
to have a medical termination

06:52.467 --> 06:53.867
of the pregnancy.

06:53.900 --> 06:57.367
Now, she tells me
you're going to be
her partner through all this?

06:57.400 --> 06:58.333
-Yes.

06:58.367 --> 07:00.400
-So, I want you to hear
what needs to be done.

07:00.433 --> 07:01.667
-Okay.
-Yeah.

07:01.700 --> 07:02.667
-Yes.
-Are you listening?

07:02.700 --> 07:04.567
-Yes. I mean,
I'm good. I'm ready.
-Now...

07:05.867 --> 07:08.533
Okay, now, she's already
had the mifepristone,

07:08.567 --> 07:11.700
which stops the supply
of the pregnancy hormone,

07:11.733 --> 07:15.500
which is needed to keep
a pregnancy progressing
and healthy.

07:15.533 --> 07:17.633
Tomorrow, she'll have
the misoprostol,

07:17.667 --> 07:19.500
which will bring
on the miscarriage,

07:19.533 --> 07:22.600
which will allow
the pregnancy tissue to pass.

07:22.633 --> 07:24.400
That can be a bit painful.

07:24.433 --> 07:26.833
Everyone reacts differently.

07:26.867 --> 07:30.200
It could take a few days
for all the tissue to pass.

07:30.233 --> 07:33.333
Most likely no more
than a heavy period,

07:33.367 --> 07:37.200
but you should be prepared
to be irritable and emotional.

07:37.233 --> 07:38.167
-Yeah.

07:39.867 --> 07:43.033
-Okay?
-Yeah. Okay.

07:44.767 --> 07:47.467
-Did you hear that?
She said you're gonna be
emotional and irritable.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.767
-Yes.
-Yes.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.533
-Mm-hmm.
-So, you remember that.

07:50.567 --> 07:54.267
So, later if you're angry,
just remember it's not my fault.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.233
-Yeah, I...
I'll be fine.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.300
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

07:57.333 --> 07:59.133
-Maybe we should write it
on your little wrist,

07:59.167 --> 08:00.233
"It is not Josh's fault."

08:00.267 --> 08:02.700
-I think I'll remember.
-Okay.

08:04.167 --> 08:06.533
You could get a little...
a little band,

08:06.567 --> 08:08.167
and instead of saying
"What would Jesus do?"

08:08.200 --> 08:09.300
it could say
"What would Josh do?"

08:09.333 --> 08:11.533
and another sign saying
"Nothing. Don't do anything."

08:13.600 --> 08:15.500
-You've got no one else?

08:15.533 --> 08:18.467
No one else in the world
free this weekend?

08:18.500 --> 08:20.300
-Boom.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.567
-All right, fine.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.567
Everything can be my fault.

08:25.267 --> 08:27.133
-(phone rings)
-Thank you.

08:28.500 --> 08:31.467
-Oh, it's my mum.
This'll be good.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.500
-Hi.
-Rose: Oh, Josh!

08:33.533 --> 08:34.833
I'm gonna get a gigolo!

08:34.867 --> 08:37.500
-Well, you have
moved on quickly.

08:37.533 --> 08:39.533
-Yeah, I'm gonna get one
with really tight shorts

08:39.567 --> 08:41.200
and a really big package,

08:41.233 --> 08:43.700
and I'm gonna parade him
around in front of Stuart.

08:43.733 --> 08:46.200
-Yeah? Where is
this parading happening?

08:46.233 --> 08:47.733
-Oh, wherever he is.
(laughs)

08:47.767 --> 08:49.600
He's gonna be so jealous!

08:49.633 --> 08:52.333
-What if he's at his house
with Hazel, his wife?

08:52.367 --> 08:54.100
-Oh, no, I'll-- I'll figure
something out.

08:54.133 --> 08:55.400
Now, where do we get a gigolo?

08:55.433 --> 08:56.467
-I don't know.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.833
Why do you think
he'll be jealous?

08:57.867 --> 08:59.567
You've got a prostitute,
he's got a wife.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.700
This isn't a win for you.

09:00.733 --> 09:02.633
-What? No-- Ooh!
I'll get a girl then!

09:02.667 --> 09:04.200
You know, that's--
that's even better!

09:04.233 --> 09:05.433
-No, that doesn't make sense.

09:05.467 --> 09:06.667
-No.
-Oh.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.633
Okay. Uh...

09:08.667 --> 09:10.600
I-- I'll keep
thinking about this.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.733
-Okay. Good.

09:11.767 --> 09:14.533
-(call ends)

09:14.567 --> 09:16.433
-I thought you said
she'd been getting better.

09:16.467 --> 09:19.333
-Yeah. She's making plans
for the future.

09:19.367 --> 09:20.733
It's a breakthrough.

09:33.133 --> 09:34.400
-(phone rings)

09:52.300 --> 09:53.567
-Mae:
Alan?

09:54.733 --> 09:57.733
Please... call me back.

10:05.167 --> 10:08.533
-I could list his DNA
with the police.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.633
-You got good contacts
in the police?

10:10.667 --> 10:12.200
-No.

10:12.233 --> 10:13.667
Oh! Uh...

10:13.700 --> 10:18.133
Maybe... maybe I could sneak
some laxative into his food.

10:18.167 --> 10:20.200
-No, I feel like
I've seen that.

10:20.233 --> 10:22.167
-I could tell him
I've got a disease,

10:22.200 --> 10:23.600
like syphilis.

10:23.633 --> 10:27.067
Then he'd have to tell Hazel
he's got syphilis.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.467
-And then he'd also
think you're gross.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.333
-(groans)

10:33.200 --> 10:34.300
-Tom:
Well, not that anyone asks,

10:34.333 --> 10:36.667
but today I found out
that I don't have wisdom teeth.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.033
I'm evolved.

10:38.067 --> 10:40.300
-I think it's hot,
like in X-Men.

10:40.333 --> 10:41.667
-Hey!

10:41.700 --> 10:43.267
Why are there no shit X-men?

10:43.300 --> 10:45.200
How are
all the mutations cool?
-(giggles)

10:45.233 --> 10:47.067
-No, I imagine there are
loads of shit ones.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.400
They just don't get invited
to Professor Charles Xavier's

10:49.433 --> 10:50.600
School for Gifted Youngsters.

10:50.633 --> 10:53.733
-Like a guy who's mutated
into having a really dry mouth

10:53.767 --> 10:56.100
and everyone can hear
his lips in Uni lectures.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.600
-(laughter)

10:57.633 --> 10:59.400
-Josh:
Does Professor Charles Xavier--
does he just...

10:59.433 --> 11:01.367
pretend not to see them?

11:01.400 --> 11:04.533
-(as Charles)
I see every mutant
in the world with this machine.

11:04.567 --> 11:07.500
-(laughs)
-Oh, who's that kid over there
with the weasel for a penis?

11:07.533 --> 11:10.200
-I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:10.233 --> 11:13.133
-Ella:
I just saw his dick turn into
a weasel and he sighed and said,

11:13.167 --> 11:15.300
"Oh no, not this again!"
-(laughter)

11:15.333 --> 11:18.667
-No you didn't!
-This conversation is shit.

11:18.700 --> 11:20.700
-Are you okay?
Do you need anything?
-No.

11:20.733 --> 11:23.300
-Well, I-- I suppose we can
bring him into the school

11:23.333 --> 11:25.700
to help with the rat problem...
-(laughter)

11:25.733 --> 11:27.267
-...if we must.

11:37.133 --> 11:38.467
-High ceilings.
-Yeah.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.700
Aren't they just fabulous?

11:39.733 --> 11:41.267
-Difficult to heat.

11:49.067 --> 11:50.067
(chuckles)

11:57.567 --> 11:58.767
-(phone rings)

12:00.500 --> 12:01.567
-Hello?

12:01.600 --> 12:03.067
-You're up.
-Josh: Yeah.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.567
-Do you want to come
apartment shopping with me?

12:04.600 --> 12:06.233
-No, I couldn't.
I just couldn't.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.400
-Oh.

12:07.433 --> 12:08.667
Oh. All right.

12:10.067 --> 12:11.533
-Okay, bye.
-Okay.

12:20.833 --> 12:23.267
-Josh:
Okay, she said
you take that for pain,

12:23.300 --> 12:24.400
this for nausea,

12:24.433 --> 12:25.700
and you hold these
under your tongue

12:25.733 --> 12:28.567
for half an hour
for termination of pregnancy.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.300
-I know, Josh.
-Okay.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.800
I will start the pill timer.

12:43.700 --> 12:45.500
Then we wait.

12:50.833 --> 12:52.433
You can't really talk, can you?

12:54.067 --> 12:55.133
It's just me.

12:55.167 --> 12:56.467
Talk about whatever I like.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.567
Ooh! What-- what does
he want to talk about?

12:59.600 --> 13:00.833
So, anything I want
to talk about.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.667
We can talk about, um...

13:02.700 --> 13:04.400
uh, we can talk about atheism.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.167
Do you want to talk
about alternative medicine?

13:08.200 --> 13:09.200
-Mm-mm.

13:09.233 --> 13:12.233
-Um, doesn't work, does it?

13:12.267 --> 13:14.367
'Cause you can't really put
the word "alternative"

13:14.400 --> 13:16.100
before the word
"medicine," you know?

13:16.133 --> 13:17.167
You can put
the word "alternative"

13:17.200 --> 13:19.367
before "ideas," you can have
alternative fashion,

13:19.400 --> 13:20.667
you know,
alternative music,

13:20.700 --> 13:22.700
but you can't have
alternative facts.

13:22.733 --> 13:23.867
Claire, I was just saying
you can't have

13:23.900 --> 13:26.367
alternative facts, can you?
-But medicine's not, like,

13:26.400 --> 13:27.700
always a fact based--
-I was just, I mean,

13:27.733 --> 13:29.167
I can't understand you.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.500
Um, because you can have al...

13:30.533 --> 13:32.567
Just putting
"alternative" before...

13:32.600 --> 13:35.267
medicine is like-- it's like
pointing at a dog and saying,

13:35.300 --> 13:37.167
"That's my alternative cat."

13:37.200 --> 13:38.567
It's still not a cat.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.200
-(laughs)

13:46.233 --> 13:47.833
-You've been quiet
for a long time.

13:47.867 --> 13:49.200
Are you okay?

13:51.333 --> 13:53.300
-Claire:
Yeah. Quiet means I'm okay.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.367
If I'm groaning, that's how
you know that I'm not okay.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.667
-I just... sorry again.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.300
I just-- I was worried
you might have fainted.

14:01.333 --> 14:04.533
-One time doing
the national anthem!

14:04.567 --> 14:06.567
-Oh, fuck!

14:06.600 --> 14:08.567
(groans)

14:08.600 --> 14:13.033
I'm never, ever, ever
having sex again, okay?

14:13.067 --> 14:14.500
-Okay.

14:14.533 --> 14:17.033
-Aah, fuck!

14:17.067 --> 14:19.267
(breathes heavily)

14:19.300 --> 14:21.567
(groans)

14:23.767 --> 14:25.200
(groans)

14:27.500 --> 14:28.600
-Babe?

14:32.867 --> 14:34.200
Babe?

14:36.067 --> 14:37.267
-I think it's done.

14:39.300 --> 14:40.667
-You did it.

14:42.733 --> 14:43.767
Hooray.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.400
-Well, what do I do now?

14:45.433 --> 14:48.000
-Uh, I think maybe
flush the toilet and then...

14:49.200 --> 14:50.600
possibly have a shower?

14:54.100 --> 14:56.133
-Do you want to see it?
-No.

14:57.133 --> 14:58.267
Nah.

14:58.300 --> 14:59.800
-You think I should
take a picture?

14:59.833 --> 15:02.500
And show it to people when
they show me photos
of their kids?

15:02.533 --> 15:04.033
-No.

15:04.067 --> 15:06.067
Just flush the toilet. Yeah.

15:13.133 --> 15:15.467
-Be out in a second.
-Okay.

15:22.767 --> 15:25.333
-(flushing)

15:55.200 --> 15:56.300
-(door opens)

15:57.467 --> 16:00.233
-So, I made fried chicken and...

16:00.267 --> 16:02.467
I was thinking maybe I'll say
some irrational feelings

16:02.500 --> 16:05.300
that I've had over the weekend
in, like, a monotone voice,

16:05.333 --> 16:07.267
and then you can do the same,
and what we'll do is,

16:07.300 --> 16:09.267
we just won't judge
each other's feelings.

16:09.300 --> 16:10.333
Yeah?

16:10.367 --> 16:12.067
-Okay.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.833
-Okay.
-I know I've had a lot.

16:13.867 --> 16:16.500
Um...

16:16.533 --> 16:21.833
I thought that my politics would
keep me safe from my feelings,

16:21.867 --> 16:23.433
and I was wrong.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.233
-Okay. Um...

16:27.267 --> 16:29.700
I got jealous that
you could get pregnant.

16:31.433 --> 16:32.833
-Um...

16:32.867 --> 16:35.067
I dressed up
for the abortion clinic.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.467
-I mean, that is a nice dress
that you were wearing.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.600
That is a good dress.
-And...

16:39.633 --> 16:43.567
I think I just didn't want
them to think that I was
like the other girls.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.467
I'm furious at myself
for thinking that.

16:46.500 --> 16:50.500
-I accidentally fantasized
about keeping the baby.

16:52.500 --> 16:53.567
-I picked out outfits.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.800
-Some of those, um, hilariously
tiny sneakers perhaps?

16:56.833 --> 16:58.700
-No. No way.
Not on my kid.

16:58.733 --> 17:00.067
-All right.

17:03.267 --> 17:04.567
-Are we done?

17:04.600 --> 17:06.200
-I mean, I'm out of things.

17:10.067 --> 17:11.567
-I felt guilty.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.100
-Yeah?

17:16.133 --> 17:18.200
Okay, look, I--
I know you know, okay?

17:18.233 --> 17:21.033
But I'll just say you have
nothing to feel guilty about.

17:21.067 --> 17:23.200
Obviously, right?

17:23.233 --> 17:24.800
-Yeah, well, maybe not guilty,

17:24.833 --> 17:28.467
but, like...
just kind of like a fuck-up

17:28.500 --> 17:32.333
because flushing the toilet,
it just reminded me of...

17:32.367 --> 17:34.500
that time I forgot
to feed Bert and Ernie,

17:34.533 --> 17:36.400
and I had to flush them
down the toilet.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.433
-Yeah.

17:40.767 --> 17:42.733
-It's just...
this is it.

17:42.767 --> 17:46.033
It's like... we're grown-ups.

17:46.067 --> 17:47.733
This is it.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.200
We're not practicing anymore.

17:51.167 --> 17:54.367
-Shit is getting real, you know?

17:55.467 --> 17:57.433
-(sniffles)
Oh, my God.

17:57.467 --> 18:00.600
No, we're not crying
and eating fried chicken.

18:00.633 --> 18:01.633
It's just...

18:01.667 --> 18:05.033
this is not an image
we're having in our lives.

18:05.067 --> 18:06.767
We have to suck it up.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.633
Pull it together.
-I think everybody

18:08.667 --> 18:10.067
cries while
eating fried chicken.

18:10.100 --> 18:12.500
I'm pretty sure tears are
the 12th ingredient.

18:12.533 --> 18:14.333
-Yeah.

18:14.367 --> 18:16.367
Yeah, when some people
get pregnant,

18:16.400 --> 18:18.100
they get to throw a party.

18:18.133 --> 18:19.367
We could have had bunting.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.800
-Do you want bunting?

18:20.833 --> 18:22.367
I mean,
I can get you bunting.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.400
If you want, I can organize
shit-loads of bunting.

18:25.433 --> 18:26.667
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

18:26.700 --> 18:30.400
-(phone rings)
-Oh, I'm sorry.

18:30.433 --> 18:32.500
Look, it's my mum, yeah?
Perfect timing.

18:32.533 --> 18:33.800
-Definitely.

18:33.833 --> 18:36.033
-Rose:
I've run out of paint, Josh!

18:36.067 --> 18:37.667
I've run out of paint!

18:37.700 --> 18:39.600
-What are you doing?
-No, I'm-- I'm writing

18:39.633 --> 18:42.200
a word on Stuart's back lawn
and I didn't bring enough paint!

18:42.233 --> 18:45.600
-Okay. Um... what word?

18:45.633 --> 18:47.800
-Well, I'm writing the C-word.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.100
-The "C-word"?

18:51.100 --> 18:52.600
I don't understand. Like "corn"?

18:52.633 --> 18:53.700
"Cuticle"?

18:53.733 --> 18:54.800
"Cornelius"?
-(snickers)

18:54.833 --> 18:57.100
-"Capsicum"?
-But I only got

18:57.133 --> 18:58.700
as far as C-U-N.

18:58.733 --> 19:00.300
-I'm sorry, I just--
I don't understand.

19:00.333 --> 19:01.700
What word were you trying
to write, Mother?

19:01.733 --> 19:03.233
-(scoffs)
I can't say it!

19:03.267 --> 19:05.067
-(both laugh)

19:05.100 --> 19:06.367
-Have you got me on speaker?

19:06.400 --> 19:09.100
Oh, J-- Josh,
take me off speaker!

19:09.133 --> 19:10.333
Oh!

19:10.367 --> 19:11.533
Oh.

19:14.633 --> 19:16.233
-* Doo-wop, doo-wop

19:16.267 --> 19:19.300
* Doo-wop, doo-wop

19:19.333 --> 19:22.733
* Doo-wop, doo-wop, ooh

19:24.233 --> 19:26.133
-Hey, Tom?
-Hm?

19:27.533 --> 19:28.633
-Do you wanna be my boyfriend?

19:28.667 --> 19:30.200
-(chuckles)

19:32.233 --> 19:35.167
Um, yeah, no, that's--
(chuckles)

19:35.200 --> 19:37.233
Sorry. Yes.

19:37.267 --> 19:39.533
-What?
-No, it's good. It's...

19:39.567 --> 19:41.133
-Do you not want to?

19:41.167 --> 19:42.500
-No, I do. I do.

19:42.533 --> 19:45.500
I-- I do, I just thought
that would be something...

19:45.533 --> 19:48.133
that kind of
happened organically,

19:48.167 --> 19:49.433
just over time.

19:50.567 --> 19:53.067
-(scoffs)
Are you kidding?

19:53.100 --> 19:54.467
-What?
(chuckles)

19:54.500 --> 19:57.233
-Oh, my God.
This is so humiliating.

19:57.267 --> 19:58.700
-No, it's good.
This is nice.

19:58.733 --> 19:59.667
This is a nice moment.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.200
We are...

20:01.233 --> 20:03.767
two people deciding
that they're gonna be

20:03.800 --> 20:06.233
boyfriend/girlfriend.
-You know, I was just
trying to be helpful.

20:06.267 --> 20:07.600
I didn't need clarification.

20:07.633 --> 20:09.700
-I was-- I just--
-You were the one
who needed clarification.

20:09.733 --> 20:11.733
-I just thought
it would be organic.

20:11.767 --> 20:13.600
Can you stop saying "organic"?

20:13.633 --> 20:14.767
You didn't want it
to be organic.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.767
You kept accidentally referring
to me as your girlfriend

20:17.800 --> 20:19.533
and then pretending
to be embarrassed.

20:19.567 --> 20:21.500
-No, it just slipped out
because it was easier

20:21.533 --> 20:25.033
than referring to you as
"girl who sleeps at my house
every single night."

20:25.067 --> 20:26.667
-I didn't want it
to be organic.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.500
You needed clarification.

20:28.533 --> 20:30.200
This is my gift to you.

20:30.233 --> 20:31.667
-Your gift?
-Mm-hmm.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.400
I don't need your gift.
I'm fine.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.500
Maybe I'm your gift.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.667
-No, Tom. You're just
a pretty shit guy, actually.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.500
Just a shit guy.
-I'm a shit guy?

20:38.533 --> 20:39.733
You're crazy.

20:39.767 --> 20:42.033
You're like a cat lady
except not old.

20:42.067 --> 20:44.433
-Sometimes when you kiss me,
I feel the oil from your nose

20:44.467 --> 20:45.567
coat my face.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.033
-You have no money.

20:47.067 --> 20:48.733
-I have self-esteem issues,
so I don't know

20:48.767 --> 20:50.100
if I'm with you
'cause you're good

20:50.133 --> 20:51.600
or just 'cause you're available.

20:51.633 --> 20:53.267
-You're bad at sex.

20:53.300 --> 20:55.700
I can go on forever with you,
literally forever.

20:55.733 --> 20:58.467
And usually, I need to think
of something bad to stop myself

20:58.500 --> 21:00.633
from ejaculating--
never with you.

21:01.733 --> 21:03.600
-That is so awful.

21:03.633 --> 21:06.633
That is just so mean.

21:06.667 --> 21:11.133
What an awful,
shit guy thing to say.

21:11.167 --> 21:14.200
Oh, now I've got
another shit boyfriend.

21:24.600 --> 21:28.233
-(cuckoo clock chimes)
-(door opens)

21:28.267 --> 21:30.800
-(door closes)
-Well, that was fucked.

21:30.833 --> 21:34.200
-Hey. Hi. Hey, maybe
kiss me on the mouth?

21:34.233 --> 21:35.500
-What happened?

21:35.533 --> 21:38.600
-Uh, we sat around awkwardly
for a while and then

21:38.633 --> 21:41.033
near the end,
my dad apologized.

21:41.067 --> 21:41.900
-Good.

21:41.933 --> 21:44.033
-Then he told me,
in his usual tone,

21:44.067 --> 21:45.567
where it's just so obvious
he thinks he's being

21:45.600 --> 21:48.233
some kind of hero,
he tells me he's working on--

21:48.267 --> 21:49.733
working on accepting it!

21:49.767 --> 21:52.833
-That's good, isn't it?
-No, it's fucked.

21:52.867 --> 21:55.367
-Yeah, fuck him.
-Don't work on me.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.533
I'm not a project.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.133
I'm meant to be grateful
that you're trying?

21:58.167 --> 21:59.467
Just be accepting!

21:59.500 --> 22:02.100
-Not just accepting, even.
Just be, like-- like, lovely.
-Mm.

22:02.133 --> 22:03.133
-Your dad's a dick.

22:03.167 --> 22:05.100
-He's a dick.

22:05.133 --> 22:07.167
-I feel bad for saying
your dad's a dick. I'm sorry.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.233
-Wait.

22:08.267 --> 22:09.700
Arnold...

22:09.733 --> 22:11.633
are you having a bad day?

22:11.667 --> 22:15.433
-Mm-hmm.
-Claire's having a bad day.

22:15.467 --> 22:16.567
-Yeah.

22:18.100 --> 22:19.200
-What are you saying?

22:20.500 --> 22:21.767
-Today's the day.

22:22.833 --> 22:24.667
-Today.
-Ella: What day?

22:24.700 --> 22:26.333
-What day?
-Uh, the day.

22:26.367 --> 22:27.600
-What day?

22:27.633 --> 22:29.367
-(dramatic music plays)

22:32.767 --> 22:37.367
-Tom:
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Cardboard Metropolis,

22:37.400 --> 22:40.033
the most populous city
in the world!

22:40.067 --> 22:44.567
Yay! Uh, Cardboard Metropolis
has survived wars and tsunamis

22:44.600 --> 22:47.233
throughout all of history,
but nothing could prepare

22:47.267 --> 22:52.500
the great empire for
the devastation of Johnzilla!

22:55.467 --> 22:57.133
-Oh, Johnzilla! Whoo!
-Aww, yeah!

22:57.167 --> 22:58.133
-Aww.

22:58.167 --> 22:59.133
-(laughter)

23:00.400 --> 23:01.667
-Claire:
Tom, you should show a video

23:01.700 --> 23:03.367
of this activity
to all the new people

23:03.400 --> 23:05.400
that you meet, and then
you'll never have to explain

23:05.433 --> 23:06.633
why you were never popular.

23:18.567 --> 23:20.333
-(dramatic music playing)

23:28.133 --> 23:30.200
-John, what are you doing?

23:30.233 --> 23:31.400
Destroy the city.

23:31.433 --> 23:33.433
-Oh, yeah, John's a pacifist.

23:33.467 --> 23:35.133
-Did you put any
dog food in there?

23:35.167 --> 23:36.800
-I put so many treats in--
No, John.

23:36.833 --> 23:42.233
You've gotta... this...
John, crush Card Broadway.

23:42.267 --> 23:44.733
-Josh:
Don't you do anything you're
not comfortable with, John.

23:44.767 --> 23:47.600
-Well, okay I don't
know now, 'cause...

23:47.633 --> 23:49.133
I've set up
all the cameras, haven't I?

23:49.167 --> 23:50.467
-(laughter)

23:53.233 --> 23:56.300
-Tom:
Expensive, and it's like--
it's rubbish.

23:56.333 --> 23:57.833
-Claire, you seem
quite angry for some reason.

23:57.867 --> 24:00.333
You feel like crushing
some civilization?

24:00.367 --> 24:01.733
-Yeah, okay.

24:01.767 --> 24:03.400
(bright, mid-tempo
music playing)

24:03.433 --> 24:04.567
-(woman vocalizing)

24:13.833 --> 24:16.333
