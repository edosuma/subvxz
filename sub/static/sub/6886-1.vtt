WEBVTT

00:41.666 --> 00:44.793
I've got the vibes. This thing is evil, man.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.171
I got a bad feeling.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.422
Shut up and keep moving.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.883
Is big mistake.

00:50.967 --> 00:53.802
Let it go, man.
We set it down, and we let it go.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.397
It's only a bloody monkey, for Christ's sake.
Now pick it up.

01:09.486 --> 01:12.237
Listen, you no pick up the cage,

01:12.363 --> 01:14.031
you no get the big dollars.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.035
Holy shit!

01:22.707 --> 01:24.833
Don't move!

01:24.876 --> 01:26.126
What are these buggers playing at?

01:35.220 --> 01:37.679
He says the Rat Monkey must be set free.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.848
He says we must leave this valley
and never return,

01:39.891 --> 01:42.267
or the evil spirits will exact their revenge.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.979
Permit. Look and see. Permit.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.147
Permit!

01:57.700 --> 02:01.537
I'm a New Zealand zoo official,
and this monkey is going to Newtown.

02:15.593 --> 02:16.635
Move it!

02:37.240 --> 02:39.366
Start her up! Quick!

02:50.253 --> 02:51.336
Hey!

02:53.089 --> 02:54.381
Drive, you buggers!

02:57.260 --> 02:58.427
Man, wait.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.095
Step on it!

03:17.488 --> 03:18.947
The little bugger bit me.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.533
Zingaya! Zingaya!

03:28.958 --> 03:30.542
You've got the bite.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.961
There's some Dettol in the jeep.

03:37.508 --> 03:38.550
Jeez! No!

03:41.095 --> 03:42.846
No! What are you doing?

03:50.855 --> 03:51.897
Zingaya.

03:53.441 --> 03:54.608
Shit!

03:58.488 --> 04:00.155
- Zingaya!
- Zingaya!

06:26.010 --> 06:27.803
Thank you.

06:32.308 --> 06:34.226
- Hi, Paquita.
- Good morning, Roger.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.483
That's the lot.

06:41.609 --> 06:45.237
Tell your dad I'll be round on Thursday
with the saveloys.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.910
That's a pretty dress, Paquita.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.793
See you later, alligator.

07:05.883 --> 07:08.427
You like that boy, Paquita?

07:12.432 --> 07:14.724
Shuffle the cards.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.859
We will see if you and Roger
are destined to be together.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.990
Create his image in your mind
and cut the cards.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.159
Paquita,

07:32.910 --> 07:34.244
I thought we'd seen the last of this.

07:34.328 --> 07:36.121
And here you go, you start over again.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.086
This is you.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.886
And this is the man of your future.

07:51.345 --> 07:52.929
But he doesn't look like Roger.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.890
It is not Roger.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.816
There will be one romance,

08:05.568 --> 08:07.569
and it shall last forever.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.404
Romance?

08:09.447 --> 08:10.739
What about money?

08:11.073 --> 08:15.952
This man will enter your life
in the near future.

08:17.038 --> 08:21.708
And you will become
romantically entangled with him.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.711
Almost immediately.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.795
But who is it?

08:26.005 --> 08:28.840
You will recognize this man

08:30.510 --> 08:33.345
by the symbol of the star

08:34.429 --> 08:36.264
and of the moon.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.686
- What is this?
- No, not that one.

08:42.270 --> 08:43.647
Paquita, we have a customer.

08:49.111 --> 08:50.195
It's bad, yes?

08:50.446 --> 08:51.613
Nothing.

08:51.906 --> 08:52.948
Paquita!

09:09.632 --> 09:11.800
Just dropping off our order.

09:18.391 --> 09:22.269
Mum says to pack the biscuits on top
because she doesn't want any broken.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.481
Actually,

09:27.191 --> 09:29.317
I'll take one of these now.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.739
Sorry.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.762
I better be off then.

10:26.250 --> 10:34.382
Lionel!

10:36.052 --> 10:37.636
Good morning, everybody.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.804
Morning, everybody. Well, now I'd like...

10:40.222 --> 10:41.264
There's a beetle.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.309
There. Under the fridge.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.146
Horrid little creature
scuttled right in front of me.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.523
I thought I told you to spray this house!

10:50.566 --> 10:52.734
The place is infested with vermin.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.986
I'll get on it straight away, Mum.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.907
Lionel!

11:01.577 --> 11:03.286
You'll be pleased to know

11:03.371 --> 11:08.583
that your mother has been voted
treasurer elect of the WLWL.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.836
The Wellington Ladies' Welfare League.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.713
That's great, Mum.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.090
And on Friday,

11:15.257 --> 11:19.386
the president, Nora Matheson,
is dropping by to offer her congratulations.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.221
Wow, the president.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.682
Oh, God!

11:24.767 --> 11:27.268
Look at the state of this place!

11:29.980 --> 11:32.273
All the windows will have to be polished.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.695
Look at this dust! It's an inch thick!

11:37.446 --> 11:38.655
You'll have to do the silver.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.449
I polished it last week.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.743
And the drapes need cleaning.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.913
I just mowed the lawn.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.916
Does this look like
a well-maintained frontage?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.477
Get off, you stupid dog.

12:10.604 --> 12:11.646
Here, I'll help you.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.981
No. I manage.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.234
Your brother usually does the deliveries.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.446
Not today.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.208
Is big house.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.296
You live here always?

12:36.505 --> 12:37.589
Yeah.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.800
You like my dog?

12:41.844 --> 12:43.052
Is very big, yes?

12:44.346 --> 12:45.972
Any bigger, and he'd belong in a zoo.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.016
Zoo? Pardon?

12:48.309 --> 12:51.978
Zoo. You know, animals? Cages?

12:55.191 --> 12:56.524
I like to go with zoo.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.903
I go with the zoo?

13:00.821 --> 13:02.572
No. No, no.

13:02.656 --> 13:03.948
You want to go to the zoo.

13:04.241 --> 13:05.658
Yes, please.

13:10.790 --> 13:11.831
Okay.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.208
Tomorrow?

13:17.630 --> 13:18.713
I'll meet you outside the shop.

13:20.883 --> 13:21.966
Okay.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.141
I have to go.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.820
My jardiniere, it's shattered.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.488
Mum, that was your favorite.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.990
It would never have happened
if you'd taken more care with the dusting.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.325
I can get you another one.

13:47.451 --> 13:48.910
It's irreplaceable.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.954
A present from your father.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.748
Our last wedding anniversary.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.001
Before he was taken from us.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.634
I miss him, too.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.411
Look.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.249
Cary Grant. He is such a dream.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.793
I wish I could be Grace Kelly.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.628
She is so pretty.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.172
Such beautiful blonde hair.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.643
Lionel?

14:58.230 --> 14:59.939
What is wrong?

15:04.236 --> 15:05.653
Sorry.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.158
When I was young, I was at the beach,
and I...

15:10.784 --> 15:14.370
I nearly drowned when I fell off this pier.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.957
My dad dived in to save me,

15:19.501 --> 15:21.336
but as he was climbing out,

15:22.796 --> 15:25.965
this freak wave just washed him out to sea

15:26.008 --> 15:28.927
and he drowned.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.359
The little monkeys! Look, Lionel.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.720
There! For you!

16:54.930 --> 16:56.639
Poor little bugger.

17:01.353 --> 17:04.188
Get out of there, you vicious little shit!

17:11.280 --> 17:13.698
Reckon they're only found
on one island, you know?

17:14.616 --> 17:16.909
Story goes, these great big rats

17:17.578 --> 17:20.621
come scuttling off the slave ships

17:20.705 --> 17:22.999
and raped all the little tree monkeys.

17:25.711 --> 17:29.255
You know, the natives use them
in black magic rituals.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.132
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.425
Don't ask me how.

17:33.177 --> 17:36.012
Probably suck the blood of virgins, eh?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.806
I want to sit down.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.184
Wow.

18:02.831 --> 18:03.915
Mum?

18:28.816 --> 18:30.108
Mum!

18:30.734 --> 18:31.776
Holy shit!

18:31.860 --> 18:33.611
Look at this. It bit me.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.863
I've been savaged.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.698
And my dress.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.867
Here, I help you.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.414
Lionel.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.917
Take me home.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.478
There you are, Vera.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.438
Now, you just rest up.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.985
I'll be back in a couple of days
to change that dressing.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.236
Thanks, Nurse McTavish.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.239
It's all right, Lionel. I'll see myself out.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.753
Why have you deliberately
gone out of your way to upset me?

19:33.922 --> 19:34.964
I'm sorry.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.720
It won't happen again.

19:56.069 --> 19:58.905
I don't deserve all this attention, darling.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.364
If you need anything during the night,

20:00.574 --> 20:04.243
- you just call.
- You're so good to me.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.912
Good night, Mum.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.225
Lionel!

20:30.312 --> 20:31.354
Hello!

20:33.482 --> 20:34.690
Keep your voice down.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.692
Look, I have your jacket.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.236
Yeah. I'll get it tomorrow.

20:38.528 --> 20:39.570
What?

20:41.990 --> 20:43.074
Look.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.387
It could've waited till the morning.

21:05.305 --> 21:06.764
Is that all you have to say?

21:08.850 --> 21:12.228
Look, I'm really sorry
about the zoo, Paquita.

21:12.312 --> 21:15.064
It's just Mum, she's...

21:15.899 --> 21:17.149
You know.

21:17.859 --> 21:20.736
We go out again? To a movie?

21:21.113 --> 21:22.196
Look.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.282
I'd like to.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.785
But it's not... It's just not possible.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.538
Not possible?

21:30.580 --> 21:32.665
But we are romantically entangled.

21:33.041 --> 21:36.335
Entangled? Look...

21:36.378 --> 21:39.088
Look, I don't know what you're thinking,

21:40.757 --> 21:42.258
but I just can't see you anymore.

22:00.068 --> 22:01.402
Paquita.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.796
There will be one romance,

22:20.881 --> 22:22.923
and it shall last forever.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.652
Wow! Mum, what a beautiful day.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.016
I'm gonna call Nurse McTavish.

23:56.059 --> 23:58.102
No. You'll do no such thing.

23:58.186 --> 24:01.230
- I'm perfectly all right.
- But...

24:03.692 --> 24:06.735
You'll look after me, Lionel.

24:14.202 --> 24:17.496
Nora Matheson. Ladies' Welfare League.

24:21.543 --> 24:23.627
Your mother's expecting us.

24:27.799 --> 24:28.883
The Mathesons are here.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.304
No, Mum. You're not well!

24:33.972 --> 24:35.848
Get my dress!

24:44.232 --> 24:45.232
Jeez!

24:45.901 --> 24:47.401
Please go back to bed, Mum.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.737
I'll put them off. It's only the Mathesons.

24:49.863 --> 24:53.324
It's the WLWL!

25:05.921 --> 25:08.255
Careful. It'll stick on crooked.

25:20.310 --> 25:23.562
Our main objective next year

25:23.605 --> 25:27.650
is to try to get
some of the younger generation

25:27.734 --> 25:29.151
involved in the league.

25:29.277 --> 25:32.863
That's why I'm so pleased
that you're on the committee, Vera.

25:34.991 --> 25:38.494
Thank you, Nora.

25:38.578 --> 25:41.872
It's a great honor.

25:45.669 --> 25:49.588
Have you had any thoughts on the agenda
for the annual meeting?

25:50.090 --> 25:56.971
Annual meeting.

26:06.481 --> 26:07.815
What we need's another war!

26:08.400 --> 26:09.733
Yes, dear.

26:12.529 --> 26:15.364
I hear Sir Edmund Hillary's
planning an attempt on the South Pole.

26:18.868 --> 26:20.077
By trek, though.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.789
Have some more beans, Mrs. Matheson.

26:25.542 --> 26:26.792
I'll have a few of those, lad.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.336
I really think we should be going, dear.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.088
Thank you, Lionel.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.424
What?

26:33.508 --> 26:35.301
No pudding?

26:37.220 --> 26:38.596
Only custard, I'm afraid.

26:38.680 --> 26:39.763
Custard.

26:39.848 --> 26:42.308
I haven't had a good custard in years.

26:42.559 --> 26:44.602
She never makes the stuff.

26:58.366 --> 27:00.909
Damn fine custard.

27:07.584 --> 27:10.628
Rich and creamy, just the way I like it.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.031
Touchy on the old food front.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.575
Never mind.

27:42.702 --> 27:44.912
That was a fine meal, boy.

27:44.954 --> 27:46.914
Thank you, Mr. Matheson.

27:59.761 --> 28:02.012
- Lionel!
- What's wrong?

28:02.764 --> 28:04.390
Lionel, you must listen to me.

28:06.226 --> 28:09.395
Dark forces are amassing against you.

28:12.107 --> 28:15.067
My grandmamma has seen it.

28:15.110 --> 28:19.405
"The path ahead is one of fear
and great danger."

28:25.453 --> 28:26.787
Fernando!

28:28.957 --> 28:30.541
Paquita, wait!

28:34.129 --> 28:35.295
God! Mum!

28:54.274 --> 28:55.524
Fernando.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.902
Your mother ate my dog!

28:59.946 --> 29:01.447
Not all of it.

29:22.510 --> 29:24.553
Get Nurse McTavish, quick.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.157
How long has your mother been like this?

29:45.200 --> 29:46.950
Since this morning.

29:48.787 --> 29:53.123
I'll call an ambulance.
You pack some things for the hospital.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.584
I'll do it.

30:09.849 --> 30:11.391
Nurse McTavish.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.697
Your mother's dead, Lionel.

30:40.421 --> 30:41.588
I'm sorry, Lionel.

30:42.757 --> 30:45.008
There was nothing we could do.

30:50.557 --> 30:52.516
She loved you very much.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.084
Which toothbrush?

31:20.962 --> 31:22.087
Lionel!

31:22.338 --> 31:23.630
Your mother's toothbrush,

31:23.715 --> 31:25.507
the white one or green one?

31:26.843 --> 31:28.010
Green!

31:36.978 --> 31:39.479
Mother, you are looking well today.

31:39.522 --> 31:43.483
I woke up this morning, Phillip,
and I feel 100% better.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.068
How about a nice cup of tea?

31:45.153 --> 31:47.154
I'll just put the jug on.

31:50.325 --> 31:53.493
Sorry, Mother.
That was your favorite teapot.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.662
It slipped out of me hand.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.331
Never mind, Phillip.

32:39.624 --> 32:44.336
Bed jacket, nightgown, slippers
and toothbrush.

32:49.467 --> 32:51.009
Where's your mother?

32:51.719 --> 32:53.387
She's gone to hospital.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.806
I didn't hear the ambulance.

32:56.599 --> 32:58.308
No, no, no.

33:00.061 --> 33:01.228
Well,

33:01.312 --> 33:04.189
she went in Nurse McTavish's car, yeah.

33:04.232 --> 33:05.732
Sort of...

33:05.775 --> 33:08.735
Well, sort of...
Sort of lying across the back seat, really.

33:08.778 --> 33:11.738
Yeah. Her and Nurse McTavish
off to hospital.

33:14.742 --> 33:15.993
But her night bag?

33:16.077 --> 33:17.577
I'll take that.

33:25.795 --> 33:29.089
So, it's you
who's been poaching my rabbits.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.799
- Lionel.
- I've a good mind to let you have it

33:30.883 --> 33:32.467
with both barrels.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.094
It weren't me, sir.

33:34.178 --> 33:36.346
It were that Johnny Morris what did it.

33:36.806 --> 33:37.931
Well, I go now.

33:38.307 --> 33:40.517
You just be on your way, young lad.

33:40.601 --> 33:44.312
If I see you here again,
I'll give you what for.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.021
What do you want?

34:28.399 --> 34:30.150
You're not from the lmmigration?

34:30.650 --> 34:34.612
I told you people
I lost my bloody papers, okay?

34:36.199 --> 34:39.076
My family left Latvia

34:39.702 --> 34:41.036
during the occupation.

34:41.661 --> 34:44.581
We were hunted like dogs!

34:45.541 --> 34:47.708
I just want to buy some

34:49.128 --> 34:50.170
sedatives.

34:51.047 --> 34:53.547
What do you think I am?
A goddamn doctor?

34:53.674 --> 34:56.967
I don't sell sedatives.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.348
Tranquilizers, I do have.

35:11.859 --> 35:14.027
Do you want a syringe,

35:14.112 --> 35:16.613
or are you going to sniff?

37:05.097 --> 37:07.682
Lionel, I am happy to see you.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.231
Tell me about these

37:15.650 --> 37:17.275
dark forces.

37:19.862 --> 37:22.322
Death surrounds him.

37:23.616 --> 37:27.661
There will be torment and suffering.

37:29.497 --> 37:30.997
You are marked.

37:35.002 --> 37:36.211
Lionel.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.800
Lionel, if something is wrong, I can...

37:41.842 --> 37:42.884
Nothing's wrong, okay?

37:54.188 --> 37:58.692
It contains the power of the white light.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.486
It will protect you.

38:02.738 --> 38:05.490
Keep it with you always.

38:11.580 --> 38:13.373
How is your mother?

38:13.416 --> 38:15.208
Fine.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.544
Yeah, they want to keep her in hospital
for a few more days.

38:45.740 --> 38:49.200
I didn't see her. She ran right in front of me.

38:52.246 --> 38:53.913
They must have discharged her early.

39:03.257 --> 39:04.758
It was a dreadful shock,

39:04.842 --> 39:06.926
losing Vera like that.

39:06.969 --> 39:10.305
Had lunch with her only last Friday.
Picture of health.

39:10.389 --> 39:13.099
- That boy of hers, where is he?
- Fine lad.

39:13.142 --> 39:15.810
Lionel called half a dozen times
in the last two days,

39:15.895 --> 39:18.938
very keen to view the remains.

39:18.981 --> 39:22.275
Of course I had to put him off.
It would have been far too distressing.

39:22.318 --> 39:25.862
As it is,
it's been a damn difficult embalming job.

39:25.946 --> 39:27.864
Oh, my God. Excuse me.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.471
I can tell you're not a Cosgrove.

39:51.514 --> 39:54.641
- You're far too good looking.
- Pardon?

39:54.683 --> 39:57.018
Les is the name. I'm Lionel's...

40:00.898 --> 40:02.065
Lionel's uncle.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.818
And who might you be?

40:04.902 --> 40:06.778
Paquita Maria Sanchez.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.325
Latin, eh?

40:12.827 --> 40:14.202
Excuse me, Father.

40:14.286 --> 40:16.121
- I am looking for Lionel.
- I haven't seen him.

40:16.163 --> 40:17.580
And if he's not here in 10 minutes,

40:17.665 --> 40:22.001
his mother will be delivered
into the hands of the Lord in his absence.

40:53.784 --> 40:55.160
You idiot.

40:55.202 --> 40:57.245
I told you to stay in there.

40:57.329 --> 41:01.666
The embalming machine
should've been turned off half an hour ago.

41:06.088 --> 41:07.964
Great! The old blowout!

41:17.141 --> 41:18.224
You're a half-wit.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.393
This is coming off your wages.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.395
- I'll fix them up.
- No, leave it.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.273
We've got to get the body to the service.

41:42.041 --> 41:46.252
The theme of today's service
is the sanctity of motherhood.

41:47.338 --> 41:52.300
Vera Cosgrove will be surely missed
by her friends and grieving family,

41:53.177 --> 41:55.345
for she was indeed a fine woman,

41:56.555 --> 41:58.973
and everything a boy
could wish for in a mother.

42:01.101 --> 42:02.227
Lionel,

42:02.603 --> 42:05.480
though deprived of his father
at an early age,

42:05.606 --> 42:08.149
was blessed with an abundance
of mother love.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.445
Though our dear ones depart,

42:12.988 --> 42:15.281
they live on in our hearts and memories.

42:16.784 --> 42:21.746
Until, in the fullness of time,
we, too, depart from this world.

42:23.707 --> 42:26.084
Until we are reunited once again.

42:27.503 --> 42:30.463
A Christian spirit is eternal.

42:31.882 --> 42:36.386
Yea, whosoever believeth
in the Lord, Jesus Christ,

42:36.679 --> 42:38.012
shall be

42:44.311 --> 42:45.687
resurrected.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.247
Poor Lionel.

43:04.331 --> 43:06.833
He was always dreadfully attached
to his mother.

43:06.917 --> 43:09.002
Well, I've seen some displays of grief
in my day,

43:09.086 --> 43:11.212
but nothing quite like that.

43:17.511 --> 43:18.886
Do you need anything?

43:18.971 --> 43:20.221
I'm fine.

43:22.474 --> 43:26.728
I called to see you yesterday,
but you didn't answer the door.

43:26.812 --> 43:29.897
I just want to be left alone for a while, okay?

43:33.861 --> 43:36.154
At least he's well provided for.

43:36.196 --> 43:38.781
Yes, well,
the Cosgroves were hardly paupers.

43:38.866 --> 43:41.075
He'll be the sole beneficiary.

44:30.417 --> 44:31.459
Hey, guys.

44:32.753 --> 44:34.420
Look what I found.

44:37.549 --> 44:39.258
What are you doing with this thing?

44:40.469 --> 44:41.761
Digging up a few stiffs?

44:41.845 --> 44:43.221
- I...
- Shut up!

44:44.598 --> 44:46.140
You know what you are?

44:46.225 --> 44:47.850
A bloody sicko.

44:48.602 --> 44:50.269
Yeah, mental.

44:55.693 --> 44:56.734
Get his wallet.

45:04.243 --> 45:06.744
That's my mother you're pissing on.

45:17.631 --> 45:18.965
It's a zombie!

45:43.449 --> 45:44.991
Mom! No!

45:55.711 --> 45:58.546
What in God's name is going on here?

46:16.899 --> 46:17.940
The devil is amongst us.

46:19.193 --> 46:20.234
Stay back, boy.

46:20.569 --> 46:23.321
This calls for divine intervention.

46:35.209 --> 46:37.335
I kick ass for the Lord!

47:36.937 --> 47:38.104
No!

48:26.528 --> 48:28.195
There you are, Mum.

48:37.664 --> 48:38.748
Void.

48:39.708 --> 48:41.208
Use the spoon.

49:22.250 --> 49:23.709
Hey, hey.

49:23.794 --> 49:25.086
Cut that out.

49:39.810 --> 49:40.851
How's it going, Lionel?

49:43.563 --> 49:46.565
Come on, mate. I'm dying for a slash.

49:46.608 --> 49:49.402
I've got a urinary infection.

49:49.444 --> 49:51.737
Christ, what a stink!

49:51.822 --> 49:55.199
Yeah. Dog must have crawled
under the house and died.

49:56.535 --> 49:58.911
Can't have been easy for you
these past few weeks, Lionel,

49:58.996 --> 50:01.122
what with your mother gone.

50:11.550 --> 50:14.635
Who's that little girl you've been seeing?

50:15.262 --> 50:16.387
What?

50:17.681 --> 50:20.891
You know, the little Latin number
with a cute bum.

50:20.934 --> 50:22.268
Paquita.

50:22.352 --> 50:24.437
Yeah. Paquita.

50:24.479 --> 50:26.272
That's the one.

50:26.356 --> 50:28.107
She's a bit of all right.

50:28.150 --> 50:30.901
Wouldn't mind her doing the growl on me.

50:37.576 --> 50:41.912
So, all this is coming your way?

50:44.124 --> 50:45.499
Of course,

50:45.959 --> 50:48.961
your mother was always intending
to leave me a bequest.

50:50.088 --> 50:53.299
Yes. We talked about it many times.

50:53.383 --> 50:55.968
It was a foregone conclusion, really.

50:56.803 --> 50:58.679
It's just, with her dying suddenly,

50:58.764 --> 51:02.266
she didn't get the chance
to include me in her will.

51:02.309 --> 51:05.519
Well, you'll have to talk to the lawyers
about that, Uncle Les.

51:05.604 --> 51:08.439
Don't bring the bloody lawyers into it.

51:08.482 --> 51:10.691
This is a private family matter.

51:12.778 --> 51:14.570
What the hell's that?

51:15.989 --> 51:17.698
It's the pipes.

51:17.783 --> 51:18.866
They do that sometimes.

51:19.117 --> 51:20.493
It's not the pipes, Lionel.

51:20.744 --> 51:22.161
It's somebody doing the business.

51:22.245 --> 51:24.663
Please, Uncle Les, you just got to leave.

51:26.792 --> 51:30.002
So you found your dad's old stag movies?

51:36.218 --> 51:38.052
Is that the one with the donkey
and the chambermaid?

51:38.345 --> 51:39.720
No, please.

51:41.431 --> 51:43.766
All right. I understand, Lionel.

51:44.768 --> 51:47.228
Some things a man prefers
to do on his own.

51:48.814 --> 51:50.231
It's all part of the grieving process.

52:00.909 --> 52:03.035
I'll be seeing you, Lionel.

52:28.228 --> 52:31.188
Nijinsky was of what nationality?

52:31.231 --> 52:32.982
Nijinsky was Russian.

52:33.066 --> 52:35.067
Russian is right. That's very...

52:50.083 --> 52:51.333
Lionel!

53:09.978 --> 53:13.564
I dropped a shilling.
It must have rolled down the drain.

53:13.857 --> 53:16.525
I come to see you,
you shut the door in my face.

53:16.610 --> 53:20.237
You built a big wall.
I telephone, and you don't answer.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.363
Why?

53:22.866 --> 53:24.283
Speak to me.

53:26.328 --> 53:27.912
You don't want to see me anymore?

53:29.122 --> 53:30.789
It was a mistake.

53:32.167 --> 53:33.334
Sorry.

53:35.170 --> 53:36.420
Goodbye.

53:51.978 --> 53:53.729
- Paquita.
- Leave me alone.

53:53.813 --> 53:55.898
- I'm sorry.
- Leave me alone.

53:58.109 --> 53:59.902
Take your hands off her, you creep!

54:02.948 --> 54:04.657
You know what they're saying about you,
don't you?

54:05.116 --> 54:06.742
You've gone funny in the head.

54:06.826 --> 54:08.994
A real bloody weirdo.

54:09.955 --> 54:13.332
You touch her again, and I'll knock you
into the middle of next week.

54:13.416 --> 54:14.541
Come on, Paquita.

55:44.549 --> 55:47.009
Cute little guy.

56:04.652 --> 56:07.112
Hello. Hello.

56:14.871 --> 56:16.622
Who's a cutie?

56:21.169 --> 56:23.420
Who's a cute little Selwyn here?

56:28.885 --> 56:30.511
Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo.

57:33.700 --> 57:35.117
So I said...

57:43.460 --> 57:44.543
Yeah!

58:09.944 --> 58:11.361
Hyperactive.

58:19.746 --> 58:21.455
So, I tackled this guy, right?

58:21.539 --> 58:23.749
I brought him down
with this real bone cruncher.

58:23.833 --> 58:27.085
And the ball rolls free, so I scooped it up,
and you know what I did?

58:27.128 --> 58:29.546
I drop kicked from 50 yards out.

58:30.381 --> 58:31.423
God, you should have seen it.

58:31.466 --> 58:33.759
Put us three points ahead,
gave us the match.

58:33.843 --> 58:35.177
Fantastic.

58:51.694 --> 58:53.195
Hello, Lionel.

58:53.821 --> 58:56.281
That's quite a collection of stiffs
you got down there.

58:56.908 --> 58:59.117
And I thought
you were such a quiet chappie.

58:59.536 --> 59:01.411
Uncle Les, they're not what you think.

59:01.454 --> 59:02.829
Back off, mate!

59:02.914 --> 59:05.541
Lay a hand on me,
I'll have you for breakfast.

59:08.586 --> 59:09.670
I'm sorry, Lionel.

59:09.963 --> 59:13.715
If I don't report this,
I'll be an accessory after the fact.

59:22.225 --> 59:25.644
I hope they can keep it out of the papers
for your mother's sake.

59:25.687 --> 59:27.813
She always hated a scandal.

59:28.815 --> 59:33.527
This is hard for me, Lionel,
informing on me sister's boy and all.

59:33.611 --> 59:36.905
Of course if I was to keep me mouth shut,
I'd be taking a hell of a risk.

59:36.990 --> 59:39.825
Hey, put me through to the police, please.

59:41.578 --> 59:46.081
Of course if I was to get my fair share
of Vera's estate,

59:46.165 --> 59:49.126
I might be more inclined
to protect a member of the family.

59:50.670 --> 59:51.837
You want the money?

59:52.589 --> 59:55.799
Detective Sergeant Bauer,
I'd like to report a multiple murder.

01:00:00.346 --> 01:00:01.888
Yes, I'll wait.

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:05.017
The money and the house.

01:00:09.355 --> 01:00:11.898
Blood is thicker than water, Lionel.

01:00:49.562 --> 01:00:52.230
Yeah, good day. Les about?

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:55.233
Barry, you bastard!

01:00:55.276 --> 01:00:57.986
Thought we'd pop over
and take a squish at your new digs.

01:00:58.071 --> 01:00:59.237
Yeah, mate. Why not?

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.074
- Rip the skins off a few brown ones.
- Yeah. We'll make a night of it.

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:03.742
- Where are you going?
- Just for a walk.

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:06.411
No, mate. These people want a feast.
We'll get a party going.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.580
We'll just get some savories for you, mate.

01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:11.208
Have you gotten rid of those stiffs yet?

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.627
Hey, Les, let's stick some real music on.

01:01:13.711 --> 01:01:17.589
Yeah. Coming through.
Better clear the dance floor.

01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:20.509
I don't know
what sort of kinky shit you're into,

01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:22.886
but I want those things buried.

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.502
Come on, baby, let's dance!

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:59.256
It's no good asking Lionel.
He's nothing like his old man.

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:02.008
He was a real stick man.

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:04.136
Used to pull the birds
like you wouldn't believe.

01:02:04.178 --> 01:02:05.804
Don't talk about my father like that.

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:13.895
Tasty.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.773
You got anything else that I can nibble on?

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:20.068
So, you know, I throw him a dummy,
fooled him completely.

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:21.445
Now, you got to imagine, this is, like...

01:02:21.487 --> 01:02:24.364
This is, like, 10, 15 yards out
from the sideline.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:26.742
There are several of these big buggers
coming towards me, right?

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:29.536
So what do I do? I... I... I put my head down,

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:33.582
and I shocked again. I touched down
right between the posts. God.

01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:35.167
You know,
the coach reckons I'm a dead certain

01:02:35.209 --> 01:02:36.501
for the next All Blacks trials.

01:02:36.544 --> 01:02:37.836
What do you think about that, Paquita?

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.006
You could be going out
with the next Bob Scott.

01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:06.198
What have we here!

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:07.949
A cute little signorina, right?

01:03:08.034 --> 01:03:11.328
- Let go of me!
- Come on, now. Don't be a party pooper.

01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:12.412
Come and have a drink.

01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:15.707
I bet you go off like a rocket.

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:23.423
You little bitch! I'll get you!

01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:26.843
Where did she go?
You foreign bitch! I'll get you!

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:54.246
Hello?

01:04:05.132 --> 01:04:06.216
Paquita!

01:04:16.435 --> 01:04:17.644
Paquita.

01:04:22.775 --> 01:04:24.651
"Death surrounds him."

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:36.121
They're not dead exactly. They're just

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:39.583
sort of rotting.

01:04:40.626 --> 01:04:42.168
Nurse McTavish.

01:04:43.087 --> 01:04:44.671
Father McGruder.

01:04:47.633 --> 01:04:49.050
Your mother!

01:04:51.512 --> 01:04:54.222
I don't know what to do, you know? I...

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:57.434
I don't know how to stop it.

01:04:59.937 --> 01:05:01.813
You must destroy them.

01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:05.609
I... I can't.

01:05:06.944 --> 01:05:08.153
Not Mum.

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:13.825
That thing is not your mother.

01:05:24.128 --> 01:05:26.463
Come on, Les, join in.

01:05:50.237 --> 01:05:51.613
I'll do it.

01:07:03.936 --> 01:07:05.186
What's this?

01:07:05.646 --> 01:07:07.564
Two lovebirds flying the coop, is it?

01:07:07.606 --> 01:07:10.150
- Out of the way, Uncle Les!
- You're not going anywhere, mate,

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:12.527
until the house papers come through.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:14.154
Come on, Lionel.

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:16.281
No, you don't!

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.131
Come on!

01:07:34.759 --> 01:07:36.468
You fiery, little bitch.

01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:39.345
It's time you and I got better acquainted.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:25.100
Help! Someone! Please!

01:08:33.901 --> 01:08:35.734
For God's sake, run!

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:37.487
Not so loud, mate!

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:25.993
Bitch!

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.254
- Help us!
- Bugger that!

01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:20.798
Run, Paquita!

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.150
Help!

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:50.036
Help! Help! Help!

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:52.580
Shit!

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:58.503
Help! Help!

01:12:37.269 --> 01:12:39.270
Please don't kill me.

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:44.734
It's okay. It's me.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.298
That's a nasty plaque problem
you got there, mate.

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:14.680
Got a bit of a cavity there, mate.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:40.581
Mandy.

01:13:41.792 --> 01:13:43.668
It's me, Rita.

01:13:44.628 --> 01:13:45.878
Remember?

01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:14.545
You mutant little shit!

01:17:26.391 --> 01:17:27.933
You'll be okay.

01:17:29.936 --> 01:17:32.897
Let me in! For Christ's sake, let me in!

01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:36.150
Let me in! Help!

01:17:36.234 --> 01:17:37.568
Please, help!

01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:39.236
Paquita, we must.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:42.573
Come on! Help! Quickly!

01:17:53.126 --> 01:17:56.253
There's thousands of them!
What the hell's this?

01:17:57.756 --> 01:17:58.881
Leave her alone.

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:02.134
She's been bitten!
You know what that means?

01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:03.761
She's gonna turn into one of them!

01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:05.638
I won't. I won't.

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:10.601
Help me!

01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:52.309
- Stop it!
- You stay out of it!

01:18:52.602 --> 01:18:54.687
I know what to do! She's history!

01:18:54.771 --> 01:18:57.189
I've read the comics! Total lobotomy!

01:18:57.274 --> 01:19:00.317
- Dismemberment!
- You're crazy!

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.487
There's no room
for hysterical women in my unit!

01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:01.462
Step right up, you creepy old bastards!

01:20:13.183 --> 01:20:14.225
Lionel.

01:20:14.768 --> 01:20:15.768
Paquita!

01:20:16.228 --> 01:20:17.394
No!

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:16.120
Just as well someone
around here's got balls, eh, girls?

01:21:22.919 --> 01:21:25.087
You goddamn little rug rat!

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:31.886
Get out of the way!

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:37.141
You little maggot!

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:42.980
Where are you, you little crawler?

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:11.175
No!

01:22:21.853 --> 01:22:23.270
Lionel!

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:36.909
Holy Christ! Vera!

01:22:57.347 --> 01:22:58.722
Leave me.

01:23:15.073 --> 01:23:16.532
Party's over.

01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:12.184
Rita?

01:27:23.947 --> 01:27:25.113
God! No!

01:28:22.922 --> 01:28:24.631
No! You just get out of here.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.383
What?

01:28:27.885 --> 01:28:29.720
Haven't seen Mum yet.

01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:55.287
Come to Mummy, Lionel.

01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:57.748
Come on!

01:29:54.514 --> 01:29:55.555
No!

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:02.020
You don't scare me, Mum.

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:13.573
All my life, you told me nothing but lies.

01:30:14.283 --> 01:30:15.784
That stuff about Dad,

01:30:16.619 --> 01:30:18.161
none of that was true!

01:30:23.501 --> 01:30:25.585
You drowned them both, Mum.

01:30:26.170 --> 01:30:28.380
Dad and that blonde woman.

01:30:28.464 --> 01:30:32.134
You caught them together
and you killed them, didn't you?

01:30:32.176 --> 01:30:34.261
How dare you speak to me like that.

01:30:34.512 --> 01:30:35.595
Didn't you?

01:30:57.702 --> 01:30:59.494
Lionel Here! Quick!

01:31:01.539 --> 01:31:02.831
Slut!

01:31:12.216 --> 01:31:14.217
Don't you touch her.

01:31:15.511 --> 01:31:16.553
No!

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:21.683
No one will ever love you like your mother.

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:37.115
No!

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:43.371
No! No!

01:31:43.414 --> 01:31:45.749
Such a good boy.

01:31:47.126 --> 01:31:48.251
No.

01:31:49.795 --> 01:31:51.087
No!

01:33:37.236 --> 01:33:38.278
No.
