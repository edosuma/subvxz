See, people, they put

02:10.530 --> 02:13.511
we have a new number.
Timothy Sloan,

02:13.667 --> 02:17.205
an estate investigator for the
New York public administrator.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.544
If somebody dies
without an apparent next of kin

02:19.706 --> 02:22.277
like the compulsive hoarder
who used to live here,

02:22.442 --> 02:23.978
they send in Sloan to find one.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.817
So, when somebody dies,

02:25.979 --> 02:27.788
Sloan figures out
who gets their stuff.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.052
Exactly.

02:29.216 --> 02:31.492
I'm undercover as his new partner.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.292
Finch, you know I don't like you
heading into danger without me.

02:34.454 --> 02:36.900
I'm not so thrilled about
my current circumstances either,

02:37.057 --> 02:38.627
<i>but I need you where you are.</i>

02:38.825 --> 02:41.396
<i>Speaking of which,

Nothing unexpected.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.376
Raymond Chandler.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.308
I grew up reading this stuff.

02:49.469 --> 02:51.346
I always dreamed
about becoming a detective.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.916
Did you try the police academy?

02:53.073 --> 02:54.245
Turns out they're not crazy

02:54.408 --> 02:57.252
about hiring someone
who can't shoot straight.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.254
You check the fridge yet?

02:59.413 --> 03:01.086
For a next of kin?

03:01.248 --> 03:04.388
You'd be surprised what pops up
behind moldy leftovers.

03:05.218 --> 03:06.424
Oh.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.924
Nothing in here but old milk,

03:09.089 --> 03:12.093
an enormous quantity of something
that used to be pasta, and...

03:12.259 --> 03:14.500
Oh, wait.

03:31.411 --> 03:33.448

See for yourself.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.553
Marcia the hoarder has a sister.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.131
Which means we have an heir.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.932
Good work, Harold.
Our job here is done.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.332
Mr. Reese, I have to leave now.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.461
<i>We found what we needed.</i>

03:47.627 --> 03:49.231
Unfortunately, so did I.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.466
Taser confetti,

03:51.631 --> 03:53.372
ejected whenever one is fired.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.104
I suppose it's too much
to hope she tased herself.

03:56.269 --> 03:57.714
Knowing Shaw, it's possible.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.977
But if I had to guess,
I'd say she's in trouble.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.553
Sorry about that.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.801
Which part?
The tasing, the drugging,

04:16.957 --> 04:19.836
- or whatever this is?
- Hmm.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.132
I had to make sure
you'd hear me out.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.267
She needs our help, and...

04:25.499 --> 04:27.672
I figured you wouldn't come willingly.

04:27.834 --> 04:28.972
She?

04:29.136 --> 04:30.513
The Machine's given me a mission,

04:30.670 --> 04:33.981
and step one is to team up with you.

04:34.141 --> 04:36.985
I'll pass.
Trust issues.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.590
Besides, The Machine
gives missions to Harold

04:39.746 --> 04:42.625
and the government,
relevant, irrelevant.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.820
Why would it be talking to you?

04:44.985 --> 04:47.329
Because now,
there's a third category.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.427
Things are evolving.

04:51.591 --> 04:55.869
And my relationship
with The Machine is a little...

04:57.330 --> 04:58.673
...different.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.369
As for trust issues,

05:01.535 --> 05:03.845
I'm happy to take the first step.

05:05.172 --> 05:09.314
There's a gun for you
in the glove compartment.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.889
Thanks, but a knife
will do just fine.

05:14.781 --> 05:16.988
This is the part where
you give me one good reason

05:17.150 --> 05:19.152
why I should believe
anything you say.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.731
October 2, 1988.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.226
You took a road trip
with your father

05:24.391 --> 05:27.804
to watch the Houston Oilers
play the Philadelphia Eagles.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.464
- He bought you a sweatshirt...
- Don't talk about my father.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.577
It told you that?

05:34.734 --> 05:36.907
The Machine trusts me,

05:37.070 --> 05:39.072
even if you don't.

05:40.073 --> 05:43.543
You spent years
working for The Machine,

05:43.710 --> 05:45.519
and she was never wrong.

05:46.246 --> 05:49.921
If you don't help me,
someone might destroy her.

05:51.251 --> 05:53.561
And innocent people will die.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.394
Forget how you feel about me.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.593
How would you feel about that?

06:00.560 --> 06:01.937
Okay.

06:02.762 --> 06:05.106
I'll forget how I feel about you.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.213
But when this is over,

06:08.368 --> 06:10.678
you better hope I don't remember.

(ENGINE STARTING)

06:12.939 --> 06:14.612
(TIRES SQUEALING)

06:22.716 --> 06:25.458
- Good evening, Mr. Reese.
- Staying out of trouble, Finch?

06:25.619 --> 06:27.292
For the moment,
although I'm not sure

06:27.454 --> 06:29.263
our Mr. Sloan could say the same.

06:29.422 --> 06:32.460
I hacked into his office network
to see what he's up to.

06:32.626 --> 06:36.096
<i>It appears our estate investigator
has taken an unorthodox interest</i>

06:36.263 --> 06:37.765
in a case that isn't his.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.309
Jason Greenfield,
died two weeks ago

06:40.467 --> 06:43.448
of an apparent heroin overdose,
no next of kin.

06:43.603 --> 06:45.879
<i>How is Sloan's interest unorthodox?</i>

06:46.039 --> 06:48.076
Would going
to a dead man's apartment alone

06:48.241 --> 06:49.982
in the middle of the night qualify?

06:50.977 --> 06:52.957
Any progress in finding Ms. Shaw?

06:53.113 --> 06:55.874
Her building doesn't have cameras,
but the one across the street does.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.662
And they agreed to let you
see the footage?

06:57.686 --> 07:00.633
After some convincing
and a sleeper hold.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.596
Point is I found out
who took Shaw,

07:03.924 --> 07:05.494
and you're not gonna like it.

07:10.330 --> 07:12.571
Find them, Mr. Reese.
Now.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.630
Why the hell are you following me?
(BARKING)

07:36.823 --> 07:38.623
Contrary to the saying,
his bite is far worse.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.366
Trust me.
Bear, still.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.648
Now, perhaps you'd like
to explain why you're breaking

07:43.810 --> 07:45.312
into Jason Greenfield's apartment

07:45.478 --> 07:47.875
and taking his possessions,
including that watch.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.707
I'm not a thief.

07:49.869 --> 07:51.542
Read the back.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.211
"To Jason Greenfield
from the Sloan family."

07:56.376 --> 07:57.548
You knew him?

07:57.711 --> 08:00.021
Jason was my foster brother.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.226
I'm here 'cause I'm trying
to solve his murder.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.627
(CHUCKLING)

08:10.657 --> 08:13.194
It's... me and Jason.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.840
His parents were addicts.

08:16.563 --> 08:19.043
They burnt the house down
cooking meth when he was 14.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.473
My mom and dad
had started fostering, so...

08:23.403 --> 08:25.076
...instant brother.

08:27.073 --> 08:29.883
When he was 18,
my parents gave him this.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.354
You know, just...
just to remind him

08:33.513 --> 08:35.583
that no matter what,
he always had us.

08:35.749 --> 08:39.025
- I just wish he believed it.
- What do you mean?

08:40.086 --> 08:42.259
Jason always messed around
with hacking.

08:42.422 --> 08:45.096
And after moving out,
he got more obsessed,

08:45.258 --> 08:47.932
and spent more and more time
with other hackers.

08:48.094 --> 08:50.040
Finally just fell off the map.

08:50.663 --> 08:55.442
Two weeks ago, I'm looking at
another investigator's case files,

08:55.602 --> 08:58.845
and I see his name.
I couldn't believe it.

08:59.039 --> 09:02.350
I mean, he swore
that he would never start using.

09:04.444 --> 09:06.856
Now, he dies of an OD?

09:07.013 --> 09:09.619
People do change.
- Not Jason.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.922
Not-not... Not about that.

09:12.619 --> 09:15.065
The minute I walked in, I knew.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.430
I mean, I've been to the homes
of a lot of heroin addicts who died.

09:18.591 --> 09:20.434
You know what you don't see?

09:20.593 --> 09:22.573
High-end TV.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.273
Stereo.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.469
Gold watch, huh?

09:27.634 --> 09:29.636
It all goes to getting their fix.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.477
You think someone killed him,
then covered it up. Why?

09:32.639 --> 09:35.813
I'm not sure. But let's
take a look at what isn't here.

09:36.976 --> 09:40.116
No computer, no tablet, no phone.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.658
What kind of hacker
doesn't have a computer?

09:42.816 --> 09:44.454
It does seem strange.

09:44.884 --> 09:48.161
You found nothing with any data
in it whatsoever?

09:49.155 --> 09:52.329
I found a flash drive
in the microwave before you came in.

09:52.992 --> 09:54.767
Looks like he fried it.

09:55.962 --> 09:58.465
May I?
I'd like to help if I can.

10:05.672 --> 10:09.643
Jason may have tried to destroy
the contents of the drive.

10:11.010 --> 10:13.820
Yes, it's largely been wiped clean.

10:15.115 --> 10:19.188
Wait.
There's a fragment of stray data.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.765
It's a piece of an e-mail.

10:21.921 --> 10:24.834
- What does it say?
- I can only recover a few words.

10:25.525 --> 10:29.029
"You don't understand.
If I try to leave, they'll kill me".

10:29.195 --> 10:31.436
The question is, who are they?

10:31.598 --> 10:33.635
And what is this?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.780
I found it in Jason's jacket.

10:38.438 --> 10:41.009
It's an address for...

10:43.042 --> 10:44.715
...a storage unit.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.221
That is weird.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.720
Our guys checked.
He didn't have a storage unit.

10:57.056 --> 10:59.536

That's one way to lower
your cholesterol.

11:34.594 --> 11:38.235
HR's protection payment.
Dirty money for dirty cops.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.270
Deliver it as usual. Then find out
where it goes from there.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.540
- I can't do that.
- Do you really wanna test me?

11:44.704 --> 11:48.242
'Cause I've got a shiny new 1911
to back me up on that.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.446
What did Morozov say to you
back there?

11:51.611 --> 11:52.919
Beats me.
I don't speak Russian.

11:53.079 --> 11:56.891
That's funny, 'cause it looked like
you understood every word.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.290
Look.

11:59.285 --> 12:02.095
Morozov's been running
that deli since I was a kid.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.360
HR knows that and respects it.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.034
These payments are about loyalty.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.140
(SCOFFING)
Let me tell you something, Laskey.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.435
One day soon,
you're gonna find out

12:12.599 --> 12:16.308
exactly what HR expects from you
in return for that loyalty.

12:16.436 --> 12:17.608

- MAN: <i>She came outta nowhere.</i>

12:26.312 --> 12:29.486
Got your message, Lionel.
Looks like you found Roots car.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.129
Yeah, and a crazy story
to go with it.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.964
Guy over there says
this medical supply van

12:32.988 --> 12:35.057
was just stolen by two women
driving that car.

12:35.221 --> 12:36.894
One waves them down,

I hate to tell you,
but Root and Shaw,

12:43.162 --> 12:46.166
they're working as a team,
a scary one.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.243
A thank you would be nice.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.343
Finch, I'm closer to Root and Shaw.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.575
From what I'm seeing,
it looks less like

12:53.740 --> 12:55.515
<i>an abduction and
more like a partnership.</i>

12:55.675 --> 12:57.677
A partnership?
To what end?

12:57.844 --> 13:00.848
No idea, but with Root involved,
anything's possible.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.960
A troubling development,
Mr. Reese,

13:03.116 --> 13:05.027
and I'm afraid I have another one.

13:05.184 --> 13:06.984
It seems that Mr. Sloan's
foster brother Jason

13:07.008 --> 13:10.196
may have been murdered
by some mysterious group.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.996
You think that same group might
be the threat against Sloan?

13:13.159 --> 13:15.159
The only way to know for sure
would be to determine

13:15.194 --> 13:16.537
who killed Jason and why.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.416
Are you sure you don't need
my help on this?

13:18.765 --> 13:21.712
No, Mr. Reese,
tracking Ms. Shaw is your top priority.

13:21.868 --> 13:23.176
All right.

13:23.336 --> 13:26.874
But, Finch,
I'm here if you need me.

13:28.808 --> 13:32.051
So I just got off the phone with
the manager from the storage center.

13:32.211 --> 13:35.715
Unit 117 was rented out
to a guy named John Glover.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.691
Now, he recognized
Jason's description,

13:37.850 --> 13:40.330
said that Jason was
one of a bunch of people

13:40.486 --> 13:42.830
who used to visit that unit
at all hours.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.060
The day after Jason died,
those same people

13:45.458 --> 13:47.062
came back in,
cleaned the place out,

13:47.226 --> 13:48.967
scrubbed it from top to bottom
with bleach.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.048
Did they have a photo ID
on file for John Glover?

13:51.130 --> 13:54.907
No. Glover paid a full year
in advance with cash.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.412
- For all we know...
- Glover may not even exist.

13:58.037 --> 14:01.678
Let's see if any other storage units
have been rented using that name.

14:02.408 --> 14:08.051
No other rentals under John Glover,
but there, in Brooklyn,

14:08.214 --> 14:11.821
another unit paid
for a full year in cash

14:11.984 --> 14:14.931
and rented the same day
they cleared out John Glover's unit.

14:15.088 --> 14:18.069
- Who rented that one?
- Samuel Miles.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.329
Wait.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.599
John Glover? Samuel Miles?
That's the connection.

14:23.763 --> 14:26.334
Glover and Miles are both generals
in the American Revolution.

14:26.499 --> 14:29.946
Hardly seems like a coincidence.
Let's go find that storage unit.

ROOT: You'll find out soon enough.

14:37.777 --> 14:42.522
When you see this statue again,
think impact.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.787
The Machine told you that?

14:44.951 --> 14:47.056
I suppose I could be making it up.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.222
And I suppose I could be
kicking your ass.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.299

14:58.631 --> 15:00.633
And where are we headed to now?

15:17.884 --> 15:19.830
You know, the last time
I used a blow torch

15:19.986 --> 15:22.990
was to get intel
from an uncooperative source.

15:23.156 --> 15:26.763
Now, you either tell me
what we're here to do, or I walk.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.071
Honestly?

15:29.962 --> 15:31.498
Most of the time,
I'm told what to do

15:31.664 --> 15:33.769
a second before I have to do it.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.971
The big picture, that's hers.

15:37.136 --> 15:39.138
The only thing
I know for sure is...

15:39.906 --> 15:42.580
I... need... you.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.682
Then you should get out of my way.

in advance and put nothing in it?

16:29.021 --> 16:31.160

The last time I saw code like this,
it was used by this man.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.690
Peter Collier.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.770
He's a member of a group
trying to send a message

19:46.794 --> 19:48.698
about government surveillance
and privacy.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.765
And he'll kill anyone
who gets in his way.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.698
So far, Collier's
the most visible member

19:52.858 --> 19:54.360
of the group,
and your foster brother,

19:54.527 --> 19:56.837
Jason Greenfield,
was likely a member as well.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.532
But Jason would never hurt anyone.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.235
Well, that may not have been
his role in the group.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.607
The e-mail I recovered
from Jason's flash drive

20:03.769 --> 20:05.908
contained an identifier string

20:06.072 --> 20:07.915
that I was able to match
to a conversation

20:08.074 --> 20:10.953
on the Darknet,
an exchange between hackers,

20:11.110 --> 20:13.021
one of whom
was being lauded for exploits

20:13.179 --> 20:14.783
that were nothing short
of astonishing.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.086
The hacker goes
by the name of "Atlas7",

20:17.249 --> 20:19.126
but their real identity seems clear.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.297
- My brother.
- Indeed.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.458
The targets he chose are all
government, military,

20:24.623 --> 20:26.296
data-collecting corporations.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.461
Perhaps that's what put him
on Collier's radar.

20:28.627 --> 20:32.769
So they teamed up, and at some point,
Greenfield tried to get out.

20:32.932 --> 20:33.933
And they killed him.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.477
They may be coming after you now.

20:35.634 --> 20:38.410
- Me?
- These people value privacy.

- By uncovering them...
- You kicked the hornet's nest.

The best way to protect you
from Collier

20:46.245 --> 20:48.987
is to find out what he's up to
and get out ahead of it.

in the storage units

20:51.217 --> 20:54.596

- A long string of text.

25:17.149 --> 25:20.028
Give that to the intake guard
at the next site.

25:20.185 --> 25:23.257
And next time, remember
your damn authentication number.

25:32.898 --> 25:35.037
REESE: <i>Still searching
Greenfield's apartment, Finch.</i>

25:35.200 --> 25:36.235
<i>Keep looking, Mr. Reese.</i>

25:36.402 --> 25:38.609
<i>None of the books you've found
so far match the code.</i>

25:38.771 --> 25:41.217
- The kitchen's clean.
- No luck here either.

25:44.109 --> 25:46.589
All right, it's gotta be somewhere.

25:46.845 --> 25:47.949
(RUMBLING)

25:49.048 --> 25:51.460
- Scavenger hunt.
- What?

25:51.617 --> 25:54.962
It... It's a game
that Jason and I used to play

25:55.120 --> 25:56.258
when we were bored.

25:56.422 --> 25:58.197
We would steal something
from each other.

25:58.357 --> 26:02.965
Then we'd hide it in the house,
except Jason would always lose

26:03.128 --> 26:06.234
because he always chose
the same place.

26:06.598 --> 26:07.770
The heating vent.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.458
Care to brush up
on your history, Finch?

26:23.615 --> 26:26.061
<i>The American Revolution:
A Concise History.</i>

26:26.218 --> 26:28.323
Why am I not surprised?
Let me see.

26:31.156 --> 26:32.829
I've located a copy online.

26:32.991 --> 26:36.268
It seems to match the algorithm
the code is based on.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.806
<i>- I'll start deciphering.</i>
- Great. Sloan and I...

26:38.997 --> 26:40.101

26:43.135 --> 26:44.614

26:45.104 --> 26:48.278
Grab him!
Hurry, we're on the clock here.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.256
- Get out of here!
- Mr. Reese?

26:56.014 --> 26:57.789
<i>Mr. Reese?</i>

26:57.950 --> 26:59.930
Mr. Reese, are you all right?

27:00.085 --> 27:01.996
- MAN 1: Let's go.
- MAN 2: Shots fired.

27:02.154 --> 27:03.827
He's with the guy in the suit.

27:04.857 --> 27:07.337
- Mr. Reese.
- Collier.

27:09.261 --> 27:10.968
<i>Mr. Reese, are you all right?</i>

27:12.364 --> 27:15.607
<i>You're right, Finch.
It's Collier. Sloan's gone.</i>

27:16.101 --> 27:18.513
And we have no way to track him.

27:18.670 --> 27:19.774
I'm afraid it gets worse.

27:19.938 --> 27:22.214
I've deciphered enough
of the code to learn its purpose.

27:22.374 --> 27:25.048
It's a plan to kill
Jason Greenfield tonight.

27:25.210 --> 27:26.689
Greenfield?

27:26.845 --> 27:28.688
Isn't he already dead?

27:28.847 --> 27:31.225
You can't keep moving me
like this.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.727
I'm an American!
I have rights.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.390
Do you even know my name?

27:45.030 --> 27:47.738
Jason Greenfield, I presume?

27:57.509 --> 27:59.318
JASON: <i>How do you know my name?</i>

27:59.478 --> 28:01.480
I know a lot about you, Jason.

28:02.581 --> 28:06.927
I know you hacked government sites
for a fringe group of activists,

28:07.085 --> 28:08.928
got squeamish when the group
turned violent,

28:09.087 --> 28:11.658
cut a deal with the feds
in exchange for a new life,

28:11.823 --> 28:13.769
and got screwed over by them
and stuck in here.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.667
Who the hell are you?

28:17.596 --> 28:19.371
Answer me.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.771
We're on a bit of a clock here,

28:20.933 --> 28:23.504
so let's dispense
with the temper tantrum.

28:23.669 --> 28:25.876
To answer your question,
I'm like you.

28:26.572 --> 28:30.110
FBI Trojan horse of 2009,
the null worm.

28:30.275 --> 28:31.845
What, that was you?

28:32.010 --> 28:34.388
That thing infected over
seven million computers worldwide

28:34.546 --> 28:37.857
in less than a week.
If you designed the worm,

28:38.016 --> 28:39.536
then you must be able
to tell me how...

28:39.685 --> 28:42.564
A self-executing attachment
rewrites the OS

28:42.721 --> 28:46.464
to infect nearby Bluetooth devices
and spread wirelessly.

28:46.625 --> 28:48.696
That was a long time ago.

28:49.962 --> 28:53.808
I'm more interested in you, Jason.

28:53.966 --> 28:56.947
Well, Jason doesn't exist anymore.

28:57.102 --> 29:00.140
Those CIA liars faked my death.

29:00.806 --> 29:03.309
It was supposed to be
for my protection.

29:03.475 --> 29:06.615
In return, I give them everything
about the group.

29:07.446 --> 29:10.154
Instead, they brought me
to this mobile black site.

29:10.315 --> 29:11.988
And now, they can
question me forever.

29:12.150 --> 29:15.654
Must have gotten bad for you to reach
out to people you don't trust.

29:15.821 --> 29:18.165
The group murdered someone.

29:21.627 --> 29:23.129
A data broker.

29:26.064 --> 29:27.509
And it's my fault.

29:29.635 --> 29:32.582
I'm the one who told Vigilance
about him in the first place.

29:32.738 --> 29:35.617
- Vigilance?
- That's their name.

29:35.774 --> 29:39.017
"Eternal vigilance is
the price of liberty."

29:39.945 --> 29:43.256
I said we should scare the bastard,

29:43.415 --> 29:46.760
but Collier convinced the group
that it was time for more...

29:49.921 --> 29:51.798
...aggressive action.

29:55.661 --> 29:57.470
I'm not a killer.

MAN: <i>Transport's here.</i>

30:00.699 --> 30:03.009
(EXHALING) <i>Prepare to move out.</i>

30:05.604 --> 30:07.106
So you never told me
why you're here.

30:07.272 --> 30:08.478
Simple, Jason.

30:10.876 --> 30:13.117
I'm here for you.

30:17.683 --> 30:19.663
- MAN 1: Move out.
- MAN 2: Got it.

30:26.792 --> 30:27.998
I'll be a ride-along.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.140
I'm not letting this one
out of my sight.

30:32.030 --> 30:33.805

<i>So Sloan's dead brother
is really alive?</i>

30:43.842 --> 30:46.982
REESE: <i>Yes, it seems Jason Greenfield
turned himself in to the CIA.</i>

30:47.145 --> 30:49.386
And now, Collier wants
to kill him for being a traitor.

30:49.548 --> 30:50.652
Precisely.

30:50.816 --> 30:53.097
According to the plan,
the assassination of Mr. Greenfield

30:53.121 --> 30:55.326
is scheduled to take place
within the hour.

30:55.487 --> 30:58.525
They're probably going to interrogate
Sloan on the way to their mission.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.810
If we can find where they're
going to kill Greenfield,

31:00.970 --> 31:02.530
then we have a chance
to save them both.

31:02.571 --> 31:04.866
Just give me a location, Finch.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.350
Got it. An intersection downtown.

31:06.431 --> 31:09.412
- I'm sending you the coordinates.
- I'm on my way.

31:10.402 --> 31:11.904
(ELECTRONIC CHATTER)

31:14.106 --> 31:15.847
So you're his brother.

31:16.742 --> 31:18.187
Jason said he had no family.

31:18.343 --> 31:20.789
What made you choose
to look into him now?

31:22.080 --> 31:23.286
None of your business.

31:23.448 --> 31:26.520
You know what?
That is right.

31:26.685 --> 31:29.188
We members of Vigilance
value privacy,

31:29.354 --> 31:31.356
even if the government doesn't.

31:31.523 --> 31:33.730
However, when you started digging
into Jason's life,

31:33.892 --> 31:38.705
you also dug into ours,
our methods, our plans,

31:38.897 --> 31:40.774
which brings me
to some rather bad news.

31:40.932 --> 31:45.472
We took a vole as lo whether
we could possibly let you live,

31:45.637 --> 31:48.277
and I'm afraid it didn't go your way.

31:48.440 --> 31:52.149
My options at this point are limited,

31:52.310 --> 31:55.621
but what I can offer you
is a quick exchange of words

31:55.781 --> 31:58.284
followed by an even quicker death.

31:58.984 --> 32:00.986
I need to know exactly
how much you know

32:01.153 --> 32:03.429
about our group and who you've told.

32:03.588 --> 32:06.125
Let's start with those two men
I've seen you with.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.271
Who are they?
Feds? NSA?

32:08.427 --> 32:10.998
I don't know, okay?

32:11.663 --> 32:13.142
I don't know
why they're helping me.

32:13.298 --> 32:14.572
I don't know why they care.

32:14.733 --> 32:20.149
All I know is Jason made a mistake
falling in with you guys.

32:21.339 --> 32:24.183
And when he realized it
and he tried to get out,

32:24.342 --> 32:26.288
you killed him for it.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.481
Seems you've gotten ahead
of things, Mr. Sloan.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.628
Jason Greenfield is very much alive.

32:34.820 --> 32:37.528
- You didn't kill him?
- No.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.362
But we are about to.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.869
And you're gonna have
a front row seat.

32:42.794 --> 32:43.932
MAN: We're here.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.710
Things are about to get a bit hectic.

32:49.868 --> 32:52.371
We'll have to continue
this conversation later.

- Reese.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.356
- Gotta save somebody.
- Know the feeling.

35:29.694 --> 35:31.674
JASON: I saw somebody out there.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.969
Tim Sloan.
Do you know why he's here?

35:34.132 --> 35:37.204
- Is he okay?
- Did you see a man heading his way?

35:37.369 --> 35:40.009
Tall, nice suit?

35:40.171 --> 35:43.175
- Yeah.
- He'll be fine.

- Ask for Ruiz.
- Who's he?

35:52.550 --> 35:54.029
I have no idea.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.363
Now go.

35:57.355 --> 35:59.892
Why?
Why are you helping me?

35:59.991 --> 36:02.232
I'm just following orders.

36:03.461 --> 36:06.738

Absolutely.

to survive this encounter.

Peter Collier.

36:58.383 --> 37:00.624
You seem to know my name.

37:01.453 --> 37:02.898

37:03.054 --> 37:04.965
But I can't say the same about you.

37:06.791 --> 37:10.898
I'm the guy you shot in the back,
and I'm hereto return the favor.

37:11.062 --> 37:14.532
Well, before you do, perhaps
you'd like to tell me how it is

37:14.699 --> 37:17.373
you manage to keep showing up
at Vigilance operations.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.867
Excuse me.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.468
- Hello?
- JASON: <i>Tim? Tim Sloan?</i>

39:55.627 --> 39:58.733
Jason? Where are you?

39:58.897 --> 40:01.309
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

40:01.466 --> 40:03.605
Listen, I've managed to create
a secure stream,

40:03.768 --> 40:07.807
so we can talk, but it'll only
last 30 seconds or so, and...

40:07.972 --> 40:11.078
I just wanted to tell you thanks.

40:11.309 --> 40:13.255
<i>Those guys I got involved with,</i>

40:13.411 --> 40:15.982
<i>I thought I'd found a new family,
but I should've known.</i>

40:16.147 --> 40:18.787
<i>- You're my family.</i>
- Jason...

40:19.951 --> 40:24.229
I want you to know
that I have something of yours,

40:24.389 --> 40:26.995
and I'm gonna hold on to it
until next time.

40:27.158 --> 40:29.229
That sounds good, Tim.

40:29.394 --> 40:30.839
You'll always be my brother.

40:30.995 --> 40:32.440
(PHONE BEEPING)

40:45.843 --> 40:48.016
We're gonna have to keep
an eye on him.

40:48.179 --> 40:50.181
Collier may try again.

40:50.348 --> 40:54.956
If Vigilance wants a revolution,
these may only be the opening shots.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.861
Equally troubling, The Machine
appears to have sent two teams

40:58.022 --> 41:00.502
into the same battle
with different goals.

41:00.658 --> 41:03.537
Why keep us in the dark
about Root and Shaw?

41:03.695 --> 41:07.871
Speaking of which, have you figured
out what to do with Root yet?

41:20.878 --> 41:23.324
There are more comfortable chairs,
if you'd rather...

41:23.481 --> 41:25.324
(CLINKING)

41:29.220 --> 41:31.222
Not to mention a padded bench,

41:31.389 --> 41:33.562
which doubles as quite
a comfortable bed,

41:33.725 --> 41:36.035
albeit a small one.

41:36.194 --> 41:38.504
And all within the proximity radius

41:38.663 --> 41:42.907
programmed into my lovely
new ankle accessory.

41:43.067 --> 41:46.173
I found out the hard way
what happens if I cross it.

41:47.305 --> 41:49.581
Just making sure you have
everything you need.

41:51.743 --> 41:54.553
Well, there's no shortage
of reading material.

41:55.646 --> 41:57.751
That's for sure, Harold.

41:57.915 --> 41:59.656
Keeps the mind occupied.

42:00.718 --> 42:04.165
You know damn well who's supposed
to be occupying my mind.

42:04.322 --> 42:06.165
I'm afraid that's
out of the question.

42:08.426 --> 42:11.737
I suppose that even if I managed
to get access to a wireless device,

42:11.896 --> 42:13.739
the Faraday cage
you've constructed in here

42:13.898 --> 42:17.107
would prevent me
from communicating with her.

42:17.268 --> 42:19.771
Your powers of deduction are,
as ever, impeccable.

42:19.937 --> 42:23.180
And your choice of pronoun,
illuminating.

42:29.113 --> 42:30.683
Well, if there's nothing else...

42:30.848 --> 42:35.524
You're going against The Machine's
wishes by keeping me here, Harold.

42:37.288 --> 42:39.290
You're only gonna make her angry.

42:41.192 --> 42:47.143
Can you imagine what a being that
powerful will do when she's angry?

42:50.301 --> 42:51.803
How can you be so certain,
Ms. Groves,

42:51.969 --> 42:55.169
that The Machine does not wish you
to be precisely where you are?
