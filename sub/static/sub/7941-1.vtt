'Dear Mr Inman,

00:34.159 --> 00:36.994
'I began by counting the days,

00:37.079 --> 00:39.748
'then the months.

00:39.832 --> 00:44.956
'I don't count on anything anymore
except the hope that you will return,

00:45.045 --> 00:50.751
'and the silent fear that in the
years since we saw each other,

00:50.843 --> 00:58.851
this war, this awful war, will have
changed us both beyond all reckoning.'

01:50.235 --> 01:52.691
This poor boy's from Alabama,

01:52.779 --> 01:55.816
He's a long way from home,
- Thank you.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.246
Why don't them Yanks just attack?

02:13.258 --> 02:15.085
Got any shirts, son?

02:15.552 --> 02:21.673
Mm-hm-hm-hm

02:21.767 --> 02:24.009
It's Mo Oakley's boy.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.938
Can't be old enough to fight, can he?

02:34.071 --> 02:36.562
Good morning,
- Morning, son.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.897
Got some boots and
jackets, You want one?

02:39.993 --> 02:42.663
Here, You want that?
- Thanks.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.536
I hope these boots can
hold up for 400 miles,

02:46.625 --> 02:49.626
'cause they're taking
me back to Cold Mountain,

02:54.591 --> 02:57.545
'I think now on the fleeting
moments betWeen us...

02:57.636 --> 03:00.209
'and wish I could repair them.

03:01.598 --> 03:05.762
My awkward nature, the
things left unsaid.'

03:10.357 --> 03:12.848
All right, that's it.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.397
Enough powder here to
blow a hole in the sky.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.860
Yeah, a real Yankee good mornin'.

03:22.953 --> 03:30.249
Mm-hm-hm-hm

03:37.384 --> 03:40.835
That old book of yours is in shreds.

03:41.972 --> 03:45.008
Same as us, Seen too much war.

03:46.477 --> 03:52.349
Hey, Oakley, Don't worry, son,
Them Yankee boys keep store hours.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.599
They ain't open yet.

04:04.328 --> 04:07.198
Close it up,

04:18.382 --> 04:21.966
Hey, where'd you come from?
- Hey, that's fresh breakfast,

04:22.053 --> 04:24.046
He's mine, Butcher,
- Hey. Hey. Get away.

04:24.139 --> 04:27.140
Hey, I saw him first,
- Come on.

04:27.226 --> 04:30.725
I saw it first.
- That's my rabbit. That's my rabbit.

04:33.607 --> 04:37.308
Get your paws off my rabbit.
Get your paws off my rabbit.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.574
'When I came with my father
to the town of Cold Mountain,

05:24.658 --> 05:27.231
'I was so shy of how I looked,

05:27.327 --> 05:29.783
'so out of place.

05:29.872 --> 05:34.201
'But did you know how happy I
was to escape from Charleston,

05:34.293 --> 05:38.041
from a world of slaves
and corsets and cotton?'

05:38.130 --> 05:40.917
What do you fools think
you'll be fightin' for?

05:41.008 --> 05:44.507
The South?
- I call this nail Northern Aggression,

05:44.595 --> 05:47.714
Damn right,
- I call this nail a Yankee Skull.

05:47.806 --> 05:50.511
Last time I checked, the
South was a direction.

05:50.601 --> 05:53.139
Never figured you for
a Lincoln lover, JT.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.972
I tell you, as soon as
I finish this chapel.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.186
I'm gonna go off and
kill me some Yankees.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.519
Piss and vinegar.

05:58.609 --> 06:01.230
Fightin' for a rich
man's slave, that's what.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.897
Whoa, here comes the minister.

06:02.988 --> 06:05.693
Ben, thank you, Will
you assist my daughter?

06:05.782 --> 06:07.740
Lord have mercy, look at that bonnet.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.534
Look what's in it.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.493
Oakley, hand me the hammer, boy.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.619
That's a true Southern belle,

06:13.707 --> 06:18.618
Mr Swanger. Good morning to you,
- Morning, Reverend.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.796
Esco, you remember my daughter, Ada,

06:21.882 --> 06:24.040
Miss Monroe,
- Good morning,

06:24.134 --> 06:25.297
Morning,
- Morning,

06:25.385 --> 06:27.212
Excellent progress,
- Morning,

06:27.304 --> 06:29.973
Mrs Swanger, Mrs Castlereagh,
- Morning, Reverend.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.263
Now, if y'all will excuse me.

06:32.351 --> 06:37.096
In Charleston, my congregation would
still be disputing the size of the windows.

06:37.189 --> 06:38.220
It's a chapel.

06:38.315 --> 06:41.269
Miss Monroe, I was
just thinkin' about you.

06:41.360 --> 06:45.025
Cold Mountain must feel
like the end of the world.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.687
Not at all,

06:47.783 --> 06:52.445
It's very beautiful,
- Well, you put us all to shame.

06:52.538 --> 06:55.373
Men up here had a bearing on
what they thought a woman was,

06:55.457 --> 06:58.826
and then you showed up,
- Oh,,,

06:58.919 --> 07:01.327
No, I doubt that,
- Oh, believe me.

07:01.421 --> 07:06.333
If you was to say a word to one of these
fools, I could get my top field cleared,

07:07.845 --> 07:10.300
Any one?
- No, um,,.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.423
Him in particular.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.593
Up in the rafters.

07:15.686 --> 07:18.307
Won't normally say boo to a goose.

07:21.400 --> 07:25.184
He's been pressin' me since
the day you arrived here,

07:29.158 --> 07:32.361
Your top field cleared?
- That's right.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.540
Good morning, I'm Ada Monroe.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.295
Inman.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.578
Inman.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.500
WP Inman.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.587
WP Inman.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.383
Repeatin' a thing doesn't improve it.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.887
People call me Inman.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.097
How 'bout that? Inman speaks.

08:01.190 --> 08:05.139
If you were to take a glass of cider,
your friends might stop staring.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.695
Inman.

08:11.283 --> 08:16.324
You're just jealous, I'm gonna take
her for a walk at Bishop's Creek,

08:16.413 --> 08:19.165
Billy, is this frame flush?
- Thank you.

08:19.249 --> 08:23.033
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Thank you, yeah, right.

08:23.795 --> 08:26.962
Richie, I seen your house, There
ain't a square angle anywhere near it.

08:27.049 --> 08:29.291
And what do you do?

08:29.384 --> 08:31.673
I work wood.

08:31.762 --> 08:33.589
Hunt.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.171
Mostly work wood.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.433
Clear fields?

08:45.609 --> 08:47.981
I can clear a field.

08:49.154 --> 08:52.855
Was there something in particular
you wished to say to me?

08:57.454 --> 09:00.289
Not that comes to me.

09:06.421 --> 09:09.292
I'll say thank you,,, for the cider.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.550
You'll walk unscathed...

09:23.814 --> 09:29.983
No ploughman's blade
will cut thee down

09:31.822 --> 09:38.359
No cutler's horn will mark thy face

09:38.453 --> 09:45.251
I've gone to find my ain true love

09:45.335 --> 09:52.501
I've gone to find my ain true love

10:59.284 --> 11:02.285
Move back. Go back. Move back.

11:02.371 --> 11:05.040
Go back. Go back.

11:05.123 --> 11:09.702
They're trapped in the wrong damn
crater, Whole plan backfired on 'em.

11:09.795 --> 11:12.202
Send them Yanks straight to hell,

11:12.297 --> 11:15.417
Hold it, hold it,
- Let's go, Turn it around.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.548
Damn fools dug their own grave.

11:20.639 --> 11:23.426
We've got 'em now, boys,

11:25.060 --> 11:28.678
It's a turkey shoot,
- What?

11:28.772 --> 11:32.141
It's a turkey shoot, They've
run themselves into a hole.

11:32.234 --> 11:34.310
Hell's busted.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.795
Oakley.

12:49.853 --> 12:52.724
Oakley.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.271
Oakley.

13:27.266 --> 13:30.682
Inman. Inman.
- Oakley.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.647
Oakley.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.627
Inman.
- Come on.

14:06.972 --> 14:08.680
Inman.

14:11.268 --> 14:14.222
I've got you.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.871
I got a few,

14:43.967 --> 14:46.458
You saw?
- I saw.

14:50.724 --> 14:53.262
Am I gonna die?

14:56.021 --> 14:58.808
Your folks can be real proud of you.

15:12.246 --> 15:17.038
Son, this fellow says he'll
play whatever you want.

15:19.211 --> 15:22.995
What about 'Bonaparte's
Retreat'? That's one I play.

15:28.220 --> 15:31.589
No, Play me somethin' sweet.

15:31.682 --> 15:34.303
Like a girl's waiting for me,

15:35.519 --> 15:39.469
You heard him,
- I only know a couple of tunes.

15:39.565 --> 15:42.103
Like when you're at Bishop's Creek,,,

15:42.901 --> 15:45.819
and you're thirsty,,,

15:45.904 --> 15:48.822
and the water's so cool.

15:50.534 --> 15:52.692
I don't know what music that is.

16:18.145 --> 16:21.229
I'm reachin' Cold Mountain before you.

16:58.477 --> 17:00.434
Good morning, Sally,

17:05.067 --> 17:08.352
Well, that's a
fine-sounding thing, - Oh,,.

17:09.363 --> 17:11.355
My piano.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.983
Oh, I've been missing it.

17:15.077 --> 17:19.868
Thank you, by the way, Inman's
in my top field clearing his debt.

17:19.957 --> 17:21.949
Oh, dear.

17:25.838 --> 17:28.126
And then he had nothing to say.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.753
He was happy.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.424
Really?

17:34.513 --> 17:37.430
Are men so different in Charleston?

17:39.393 --> 17:41.136
Men?

17:42.563 --> 17:44.472
I don't know.

17:44.565 --> 17:50.270
If you're sayin' you might like him,
why not go over and say good mornin'?

17:50.362 --> 17:52.355
I should be gettin' along.

17:52.447 --> 17:55.318
Walk on, quickly.

17:55.409 --> 17:58.529
Come on, Walk on, Slowly.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.660
Walk on.

18:10.716 --> 18:13.171
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.573
My dear daughter, Ada,

18:47.669 --> 18:54.206
who's given up so much for so long to help
me in my ministry, and upon whom I rely.

18:56.804 --> 19:03.091
Friends, we are both very happy to
have this opportunity tonight,,,

19:04.269 --> 19:07.187
to thank you from our hearts,,,

19:08.232 --> 19:13.309
for your kind welcome and,
most of all, such a fine chapel.

19:14.863 --> 19:17.188
So,,,

19:17.282 --> 19:20.283
,, thank you, and God bless you.

19:23.330 --> 19:29.499
Our house is always open
to any of you at any time.

19:29.586 --> 19:32.042
Welcome.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.210
Esco?

19:37.511 --> 19:39.503
That gentleman
- he help build the chapel?

19:39.596 --> 19:42.550
Him? No, that's Teague.

19:42.641 --> 19:46.508
At one time the Teague family
owned the whole of Cold Mountain.

19:46.603 --> 19:51.099
My farm, your farm, it all
belonged to his grandpappy.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.765
Teague wanted this place
bad, and you got it.

19:53.861 --> 19:56.612
And he's here sniffin'
out an advantage.

19:58.657 --> 20:04.280
There's no advantage here, except
to celebrate a job well done.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.577
And that is a good thing
in these troubled times,

20:06.665 --> 20:09.749
Miss Monroe,
- Thank you,

20:14.506 --> 20:19.382
Were you never planning to come inside?
- I'm wetter than a fish,

20:20.846 --> 20:24.049
There's a good fire going,
- I'm all right.

20:26.810 --> 20:29.681
You're always carrying a tray.

20:31.982 --> 20:35.565
I was going to take some
root beer over to the Negroes.

20:43.619 --> 20:46.536
Somebody said you were enlisting,

20:46.663 --> 20:50.412
Are you?
- If there is a war, we'll all fight,

21:04.139 --> 21:07.473
Did you get a picture made?
- Say again?

21:07.559 --> 21:12.055
A tintype, with your musket
and your courage on display.

21:13.398 --> 21:15.936
You're laughin' at me.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.816
I don't know you.

21:23.617 --> 21:26.903
This doesn't come out right.

21:26.995 --> 21:32.535
If it were enough just to
stand, without the words,,.

21:34.336 --> 21:36.329
It is.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.215
It is.

21:44.930 --> 21:47.136
You,,, Look.

21:47.224 --> 21:50.640
Look, Look at the sky
now, What colour is it?

21:52.813 --> 21:55.730
Or the way,,, a hawk flies?

21:58.360 --> 22:01.231
Or you wake up,,,

22:01.321 --> 22:05.818
and your ribs are bruised
thinking so hard on somebody.

22:06.910 --> 22:09.532
What do you call that?

22:18.005 --> 22:20.081
I'll do that.

22:21.300 --> 22:24.135
I can't get much wetter,

22:26.555 --> 22:30.932
'What if you are killed,
and I'll never see you again?

22:31.018 --> 22:35.810
'You said after a few years I
would barely remember your name.

22:35.898 --> 22:38.436
'Oh, Inman.

22:38.525 --> 22:43.234
It is more than three years,
and I remember your name.'

22:44.323 --> 22:47.110
Soldiers, Don't get up.

22:49.077 --> 22:51.284
You are mentioned
tonight in my report.

22:51.371 --> 22:56.247
You men from Cold Mountain have
once again been heroes for the cause.

22:56.335 --> 23:00.202
There are Yankees in that stand of trees
between us, stuck there from the retreat.

23:00.297 --> 23:05.588
If they stay there, tomorrow mornin'
they can shoot us down for sport.

23:09.264 --> 23:11.838
Go around.

23:13.811 --> 23:15.269
It's a Reb.

23:15.354 --> 23:17.014
How many of them are there?

23:17.105 --> 23:18.516
I think there's five.

23:18.607 --> 23:21.561
Under the trees,

23:23.403 --> 23:25.526
We got 'em,
- Let's go, let's go.

23:25.614 --> 23:27.737
Butcher's down.

23:28.909 --> 23:32.242
Leave him, leave him,
He's gone, Let's go.

23:34.957 --> 23:37.626
Go, go. Go. Run.

23:38.961 --> 23:42.709
Go. Go. Go.
- Hold your fire.

23:42.798 --> 23:45.040
What's over by them trees?

23:45.133 --> 23:47.671
It's us. It's us.

23:49.888 --> 23:52.260
I said hold your fire. Hold your fire.

23:59.565 --> 24:02.815
Leave him, Leave him.

24:02.901 --> 24:05.227
Agh.

24:32.181 --> 24:35.051
Inman'll get it.

24:35.142 --> 24:39.436
Supposed to bring good luck,
a bird caught in a room.

24:39.521 --> 24:44.064
I'm so sorry to have kept you
waiting, She'll just be a few seconds,

25:48.924 --> 25:50.963
Mr Inman,
- Reverend,

25:51.051 --> 25:53.886
What can I do for you?
- I have some sheet music.

25:53.971 --> 25:57.422
It belonged to my
father, No use to me.

25:57.516 --> 25:59.176
Thank you,

25:59.268 --> 26:01.640
You must come in,
- I should probably get along.

26:01.728 --> 26:04.932
Mr Inman is more comfortable outdoors.

26:05.023 --> 26:08.724
Perhaps we might,,,
perhaps we might take a walk.

26:08.819 --> 26:10.895
A splendid idea.

26:13.657 --> 26:16.195
Let me just get your hat.

26:19.746 --> 26:24.492
I dragged my poor daughter 400 miles
from Charleston to Cold Mountain...

26:24.585 --> 26:28.914
because my doctors, they've
been sayin' my chest is weak.

26:29.006 --> 26:31.793
So the air's supposed to do me good.

26:32.801 --> 26:35.126
But it's the view I think heals.

26:35.220 --> 26:39.847
It's what people say we're
fightin' for, To keep it that way.

26:39.933 --> 26:43.931
I have no plans to preach
war in my church, Mr Inman.

26:45.439 --> 26:51.109
I imagine God is weary of being called
down on both sides of an argument.

26:53.322 --> 26:55.813
I imagine God is.

27:01.747 --> 27:03.905
Thank you.

27:05.417 --> 27:08.288
Now, your father played
the piano, did he?

27:08.378 --> 27:10.620
That's right, He was a teacher.

27:10.714 --> 27:13.122
And is your father living, Mr Inman?

27:13.217 --> 27:15.458
He is not,
- And your mother?

27:15.552 --> 27:18.838
No, sir, She died when I was born.

27:46.583 --> 27:49.205
Farewell, vain world

27:49.294 --> 27:51.287
I'm going home

27:51.380 --> 27:55.543
My saviour smiles and bids me come

27:55.634 --> 27:59.169
And I don't care to stay here long

27:59.263 --> 28:04.008
Sweet angels beckon me away

28:04.101 --> 28:08.264
To sing God's praise in endless day

28:08.355 --> 28:11.689
And I don't care to stay here long

28:11.775 --> 28:15.476
Right up yonder, Christians...

28:15.571 --> 28:19.189
Secession,
- North Carolina left the Union.

28:19.283 --> 28:25.286
O, yes, my Lord, for I
don't care to stay here long

28:25.372 --> 28:26.451
Whoo.

28:26.540 --> 28:28.995
We got our
war. - Whoo-hoo.

28:29.084 --> 28:31.540
...that I am born to die

28:31.628 --> 28:36.290
From grief and woe my soul shall fly

28:36.383 --> 28:39.717
And I don't care to stay here long

28:39.803 --> 28:44.880
Bright angels shall convey me home

28:44.975 --> 28:49.187
Away to New Jerusalem

28:49.271 --> 28:54.645
And I don't care to stay here long

28:56.069 --> 29:00.815
We got our war. We got it.
We got it. It's about time.

29:00.908 --> 29:02.900
Whoo.

29:04.953 --> 29:07.444
All right.
- Inman. Inman.

29:07.539 --> 29:10.030
Ready to fight, son, ready to fight.

29:10.125 --> 29:11.204
Whoo.

29:11.293 --> 29:13.665
We got our war, man.

29:13.754 --> 29:16.245
Well, you have your war.

29:17.424 --> 29:18.587
Ada.

29:19.593 --> 29:21.420
Ada.

29:22.596 --> 29:25.513
It's a great day for North Carolina.

29:25.599 --> 29:29.644
Those who follow Lincoln
or preach abolition,,,

29:30.479 --> 29:32.637
you best keep one eye
open when you're sleepin'.

29:32.731 --> 29:35.934
OI' boogeyman might get you.

29:36.026 --> 29:39.312
Are you the law all
of a sudden, Mr Teague?

29:39.404 --> 29:41.563
That's right, son.

29:41.657 --> 29:45.701
Home Guard for Haywood County,
And I'm the law from today.

29:45.786 --> 29:50.614
Y'all go fight now, We'll
watch over your sweethearts.

29:50.707 --> 29:53.033
Hey, Teague, Why ain't you fightin'?

29:53.126 --> 29:55.748
'Cause he's too old.

29:55.838 --> 29:57.996
Yeah.

29:58.090 --> 29:59.964
Whoo.

30:00.884 --> 30:03.802
You might be safer back in Charleston,

30:07.766 --> 30:12.013
But then who'll be waiting for you?
- Three cheers for North Carolina.

30:12.104 --> 30:14.227
All right,
- Three cheers for the South.

30:14.314 --> 30:15.892
Hip hip hurrah.

30:15.983 --> 30:18.189
Hip hip hurrah.

30:18.277 --> 30:20.400
Hip hip hurrah.

30:32.124 --> 30:34.959
Inman, It belongs to Inman.

30:35.043 --> 30:37.369
I got it, He's here.

30:41.675 --> 30:45.720
They found that book you
been worryin' about, soldier.

31:26.303 --> 31:28.212
Wait.

31:38.023 --> 31:41.855
I found you this
book to take with you.

31:41.944 --> 31:44.020
William Bartram.

31:45.447 --> 31:47.772
They tell me it's good.

31:48.909 --> 31:52.859
I think he writes about
these parts, the author, so,,.

31:54.122 --> 31:56.245
Thank you.

31:57.584 --> 31:59.743
And this.

32:07.886 --> 32:10.591
I'm not smiling in it.

32:13.183 --> 32:16.018
I don't know how to do that,

32:16.103 --> 32:18.012
hold a smile,

32:41.587 --> 32:43.579
Ada,
- What?

33:06.403 --> 33:08.894
Whoa.
- He'll be back in a month.

33:11.492 --> 33:13.899
Kiss her for me.

33:21.293 --> 33:23.416
Come on, let's go.

33:28.550 --> 33:31.468
I'll be waiting for you.

34:06.839 --> 34:08.463
Lookin' good, Butcher.

34:08.549 --> 34:11.040
Bring home some
Yankee scalps, Swimmer.

34:11.134 --> 34:12.960
Yee-haw.

34:17.431 --> 34:22.592
Look out the window, ladies. See
what these poor fools are dyin' for.

34:22.688 --> 34:26.851
How many would still lose a
leg for the rich man's slave?

34:27.693 --> 34:33.280
Most of these soldiers'll be dead by
morning, or if they're stubborn, by nightfall.

34:33.364 --> 34:38.027
I've other men outside in the
courtyard waitin' for beds,

34:38.120 --> 34:40.741
so any kind word will be a blessin'.

34:44.168 --> 34:46.741
It's the heat, I'm sorry, They rot.

34:46.837 --> 34:49.375
Pigeon River,,.

34:49.464 --> 34:52.134
How are you, son?

34:52.217 --> 34:55.217
Cold,,, Mountain,,.

34:57.598 --> 34:59.923
I- I'm sorry,

35:00.017 --> 35:04.429
You want water?
- Cold,,, Mountain.

35:06.315 --> 35:08.391
Cold Mountain?

35:09.318 --> 35:11.310
Cold Mountain.

35:14.656 --> 35:20.529
Do you worry when there's no
word from him? From Mr Inman?

35:22.247 --> 35:24.074
Yes.

35:26.335 --> 35:29.039
But then I've tried countin'
the number of words...

35:29.129 --> 35:34.005
which have passed between Mr Inman and me
- not very many.

35:34.092 --> 35:38.339
But I think about him,
Daddy, all the time.

35:38.430 --> 35:42.642
I lost your mother after
22 months of marriage.

35:44.603 --> 35:47.094
It was enough to fill a life.

35:53.195 --> 35:55.318
That was the last of the ham,

35:55.405 --> 35:58.821
It was delicious,
- I have to learn how to cook.

35:58.909 --> 36:01.317
I was thinking of saying
something in chapel.

36:01.411 --> 36:03.534
Perhaps some of the
womenfolk will volunteer.

36:03.622 --> 36:06.825
I can't have people coming
here and cooking for me.

36:08.794 --> 36:10.205
I so,,.

36:10.295 --> 36:11.837
I so regret,,.

36:11.922 --> 36:18.209
I should have raised you less like a
companion and more like a young woman.

36:18.303 --> 36:22.431
I'm sorry, Ada, And
for dragging you here.

36:22.516 --> 36:24.555
I'm not sorry.

36:27.771 --> 36:30.476
I would have followed you anywhere,

36:32.985 --> 36:35.654
To Mongolia,
- Mongolia.

36:36.780 --> 36:41.987
But with no one left to work this place,
nothing to buy, nothing left to buy it with.

36:43.620 --> 36:47.665
I just don't know how we're
gonna get through another winter.

36:50.377 --> 36:56.131
Will you play me somethin'? Somethin'
peaceful while I look over my sermon.

36:56.216 --> 36:58.256
It's too damp out here,
You should come inside.

36:58.343 --> 37:00.170
No.

37:00.262 --> 37:01.293
I like it.

37:16.987 --> 37:19.988
Daddy, bring the tablecloth in.

37:22.576 --> 37:25.067
Come inside before you drown.

38:12.793 --> 38:14.999
You have a letter.

38:15.087 --> 38:17.126
North Carolina.

38:18.882 --> 38:21.456
It's come a long way.

38:24.346 --> 38:26.635
It's not too recent.

38:26.723 --> 38:29.214
It's written this past winter.

38:31.478 --> 38:33.886
I'm afraid I can't read who it's from,

38:38.735 --> 38:40.894
'Dear Mr Inman,,,'

38:41.864 --> 38:47.487
'Since you've left, time has been
measured out in bitter chapters.

38:47.578 --> 38:50.247
'Last fall, my poor father died.

38:52.207 --> 38:55.078
'Our farm at Black Cove is abandoned.

38:58.005 --> 39:02.216
'Every house in these
mountains touched by tragedy.

39:04.595 --> 39:09.340
'Each day the dread... of
learning who has fallen...

39:10.601 --> 39:13.602
who will not return
from this terrible war.

39:15.606 --> 39:18.642
'And no word from you.

39:18.734 --> 39:20.773
'Are you alive?

39:20.861 --> 39:23.613
'I pray to God you are.

39:24.781 --> 39:27.070
'This war is lost
on the battlefield...

39:27.159 --> 39:31.951
and is being lost tWice over
by those who stayed behind.'

39:32.039 --> 39:35.408
He ain't comin' back, you know that.

39:39.588 --> 39:42.293
You must know that in your heart.

39:44.885 --> 39:47.008
Look at me.

39:48.764 --> 39:51.136
Look at me.

39:55.854 --> 39:58.428
I'm not nothin',

40:00.734 --> 40:05.277
'I'm still waiting,
as I promised I would.

40:07.783 --> 40:11.318
'But I find myself alone
and at the end of my wits...

40:12.996 --> 40:17.705
too embarrassed to keep taking from
those who can least afford to give.'

40:18.794 --> 40:21.748
Ada. It's Sally.

40:21.839 --> 40:23.037
Ada.

40:23.131 --> 40:25.254
Look at the state of this place.

40:25.342 --> 40:29.007
Well, set it on the porch.

40:30.514 --> 40:33.965
She let them slaves
go free, and now,,.

40:34.059 --> 40:38.851
Poor soul, she's got nobody and
nothin', and waitin' on a ghost.

40:45.237 --> 40:47.111
Shoo.

40:49.741 --> 40:51.651
Go away.

40:56.707 --> 40:58.035
Devil.

41:01.712 --> 41:06.208
'My last thread of courage now
is to put my faith in you...

41:08.677 --> 41:11.429
'and to believe I will see you again.

41:12.598 --> 41:17.058
'So now I say to
you, plain as I can...

41:18.520 --> 41:21.770
'if you are fighting, stop fighting.

41:23.025 --> 41:26.358
'If you are marching, stop marching.

41:28.489 --> 41:30.896
'Come back to me.

41:34.453 --> 41:36.778
Come back to me is my request,'

41:44.963 --> 41:47.454
'Come back to me.

41:49.092 --> 41:52.758
Come back to me is my request.'

41:54.973 --> 41:58.923
Wounded men, don't stray
from the hospital grounds.

41:59.603 --> 42:01.643
Hey.

42:03.398 --> 42:05.023
If they send us back to fight,,.

42:05.108 --> 42:09.023
Hey, get your peanuts
now, from the blind man,

42:10.447 --> 42:13.863
Hey, your hot goobers here,
- It's a sad day.

42:17.871 --> 42:20.706
Gettin' better, soldier?

42:20.791 --> 42:23.496
Seems that way.

42:23.585 --> 42:25.542
I wouldn't hurry.

42:25.629 --> 42:29.543
The war's almost done, Don't
need your help to lose it.

42:30.801 --> 42:35.926
You got ten minutes now, boys, Ten
minutes to get your haircuts and shaves.

42:36.014 --> 42:38.885
I've been meanin' to ask you,
Where'd you take your wound?

42:38.976 --> 42:41.217
Oh, before I was born.

42:41.311 --> 42:43.719
Never set eyes on a
thing in this world.

42:43.814 --> 42:49.401
Not a tree, a gun or a woman,
Put my hand on all three, though,

42:51.113 --> 42:53.948
What would you give for that?
- Hm?

42:54.032 --> 42:58.410
To have your eyeballs for ten minutes,
- Ten minutes?

42:58.495 --> 43:01.033
I wouldn't give an Indian head cent,

43:01.123 --> 43:05.251
Might turn me hateful,
- That's sure what seein's done to me.

43:05.335 --> 43:08.253
No, that's not the way I meant it.

43:08.338 --> 43:10.829
You said ten minutes.

43:10.924 --> 43:15.337
It's havin' a thing and then
the loss of it I'm talking about.

43:15.429 --> 43:21.134
Then we don't agree, There's not much I
wouldn't give for ten minutes of someplace.

43:21.226 --> 43:25.176
Yeah, someplace,,, or someone.

43:28.233 --> 43:31.234
You watch yourself, now.

43:31.320 --> 43:34.321
They're shootin' men who
take themselves a walk.

44:13.237 --> 44:16.356
By order of Zebulon Vance,

44:16.448 --> 44:19.864
governor of this great
state of North Carolina,

44:19.952 --> 44:24.993
any soldier turned deserter
is guilty of treason,

44:25.082 --> 44:27.917
and should be hunted down like a dog.

44:29.419 --> 44:34.758
Any man who takes in a deserter
is likewise guilty of treason.

44:34.842 --> 44:38.756
The Home Guard is powered to
enter any place it sees fit...

44:38.846 --> 44:42.215
without notice or constraint

44:42.307 --> 44:45.095
Captain Teague needs more volunteers.

44:45.185 --> 44:49.432
Any man whose age or infirmity prevents
him from fightin' shall join us...

44:49.523 --> 44:54.066
to protect this county from Yankee
raiders and traitors to the cause,

44:54.153 --> 44:56.062
Is there a letter for me?
- Nothin'.

44:56.155 --> 45:00.947
We've been gettin' no post through at all,
The sooner we lose this war the better.

45:01.034 --> 45:04.201
They say not one boy in ten is
comin' home to these mountains.

45:04.288 --> 45:09.578
Teague and his rabble throwin' their weight
around, They're worse than the Yankees.

45:09.668 --> 45:12.159
Might I speak with you, please?

45:13.755 --> 45:16.591
This was the Reverend Monroe's.

45:19.052 --> 45:21.674
I don't know who would want a watch.

45:24.099 --> 45:26.637
Who can bear to look at the time?

45:29.688 --> 45:32.724
I've got a little
salt pork you can have.

45:34.234 --> 45:37.105
Keep your daddy's watch.

45:38.572 --> 45:41.145
Thank you.

45:42.743 --> 45:44.700
I was talkin' to some
of the other womenfolk...

45:44.786 --> 45:47.360
about maybe lookin' in on you at
Black Cove, It's hard right now, but,,.

45:47.456 --> 45:51.288
Oh, no, I manage very
well, whatever the talk is.

45:53.754 --> 45:56.327
I'm very grateful for the pork.

45:58.634 --> 46:01.753
Which I intend to pay for, of course.

46:10.354 --> 46:13.105
Is everything all right?

46:13.190 --> 46:15.313
Mm-hmm.

46:29.623 --> 46:31.450
Ada.

46:31.542 --> 46:33.368
Ada.

46:35.337 --> 46:38.872
Why, Ada, you are skinny
as a whippet, girl,

46:38.966 --> 46:42.417
You are comin' indoors with me,
- No, I can't.

46:42.511 --> 46:44.503
I don't,,.

46:45.681 --> 46:47.839
I can't keep countin'
on your kindness.

46:47.933 --> 46:50.009
Now, come on, I'm makin' a stew.

46:50.102 --> 46:54.930
We'd be proud to have you, Esco's
gonna be wantin' his dinner.

46:56.233 --> 46:59.732
I just wanna stop, I tell you, Yeah.

46:59.820 --> 47:04.233
Sit on the porch with Sal,
watch my boys in the fields,

47:04.324 --> 47:08.239
holler 'Good job' every hour or so.

47:08.328 --> 47:12.112
That'll be a good day,
when our boys get home.

47:12.207 --> 47:15.042
What about your people in Charleston?

47:18.172 --> 47:20.923
There are no people.

47:21.008 --> 47:23.759
And there's no money.

47:23.844 --> 47:27.794
My father had some
bonds and investments.

47:27.890 --> 47:31.590
They're worthless now,
of course, The war,,.

47:33.187 --> 47:38.098
They're not worth anything, I
don't have anywhere else to go.

47:43.739 --> 47:45.945
I don't wanna go,

47:48.118 --> 47:51.036
You're waiting on a feller,
- Oh.

47:54.208 --> 47:56.284
Look down our well,,,
- Esco,,.

47:56.376 --> 47:58.369
She should.

47:59.129 --> 48:04.420
If you look down our well with a mirror,
you'll see the future, It's what they say.

48:05.969 --> 48:08.721
You do it, She does it.

48:11.058 --> 48:12.718
What kind of mirror?

48:14.019 --> 48:17.637
We'll hold on to you, Esco, you hold on,
- I got her,

48:17.731 --> 48:20.305
We got you,
- Mm.

48:21.902 --> 48:23.895
See anything?

48:26.198 --> 48:27.361
Uh,,.

48:28.158 --> 48:29.652
Uh,,,

48:29.743 --> 48:32.661
I don't know,
- I tried many a time,

48:32.746 --> 48:36.115
lookin' for a sign my
boys were comin' home.

48:36.208 --> 48:38.497
I never saw a dickey bird,

48:53.600 --> 48:56.471
Oh.
- Are you all right? Ada?

48:56.562 --> 48:59.313
What? What happened?

49:01.358 --> 49:04.193
What'd you see? What'd you see?

49:05.028 --> 49:08.362
'Yesterday, I saw you
walkin' back to me...

49:09.199 --> 49:11.275
'or thought I did.

49:12.494 --> 49:17.073
'I found myself crouching
over Sally Swanger's well...

49:22.504 --> 49:25.956
'...like a madwoman
staring into its secrets.

49:27.843 --> 49:33.383
'Was it you I saw walking home
to me, or was it your ghost?

49:33.474 --> 49:37.685
'After so long, I know I must
learn to survive on my own...

49:37.769 --> 49:40.889
'and accept you will not return.

49:40.981 --> 49:44.315
And yet I cannot. I cannot.'

49:49.990 --> 49:52.148
Them cows wants milkin'.

49:52.242 --> 49:55.492
If that letter ain't urgent,
them cows is is what I'm sayin'.

49:55.579 --> 49:57.618
I don't know you.

49:57.706 --> 50:00.873
Old lady Swanger says you need help.

50:00.959 --> 50:03.035
Here I am.

50:03.921 --> 50:08.796
I,,, I need help but,,, I need,,, I
do need help, but I need a labourer.

50:08.884 --> 50:13.925
There's,,, ploughing and rough work, I
think there's been a misunderstanding.

50:14.014 --> 50:16.849
What's that rake for?

50:16.934 --> 50:19.685
The rake?  - Well, it ain't 
for gardenin', that's for sure.

50:19.770 --> 50:23.388
Number one, you got a horse? I
can plough all day, I'm a worker.

50:23.482 --> 50:25.889
Number two, ain't no man better'n me,

50:25.984 --> 50:30.231
'cause there ain't no man around
who ain't old or full of mischief,

50:31.657 --> 50:35.191
I know your plight,
- My plight?

50:35.285 --> 50:38.820
Am I hard to hear? 'Cause
you keep repeatin' everything.

50:38.914 --> 50:42.579
I ain't lookin' for money, I never cared
for it and now it ain't worth nothin'.

50:42.668 --> 50:45.834
I expect to board and
eat, at the same table,

50:45.921 --> 50:49.088
I ain't a servant, if you get my meanin',
- You're not a servant.

50:49.174 --> 50:53.836
People's gonna have to empty
their own night jars is my point.

50:53.929 --> 50:56.800
And I don't expect to work whilst
you sit around and watch, neither.

50:56.890 --> 50:58.005
Right.

50:58.100 --> 51:00.935
Right, Is that a yes or a no?

51:03.564 --> 51:06.600
There's a rooster, He's
the devil, I'm sure of it.

51:06.692 --> 51:09.265
I go near him and he
is at me with his spurs.

51:09.361 --> 51:11.519
He's Lucifer himself.

51:11.613 --> 51:14.863
I despise a floggin' rooster.

51:15.826 --> 51:17.865
Oh, no, I wouldn't,,.

51:17.953 --> 51:20.954
My name's Ruby Thewes,
I know your name.

51:30.382 --> 51:32.873
Let's put him in a pot.

51:39.141 --> 51:40.968
Mm-hm-hm-hm

51:41.059 --> 51:44.974
Mm-hm-hm-hm

51:46.815 --> 51:48.274
Mm-hm-hm-hm

51:48.358 --> 51:52.688
Mm-hm-hm-hm

51:58.827 --> 52:00.736
Urgh.

52:01.788 --> 52:04.326
Mm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm

52:04.416 --> 52:08.081
Mm-hm-hm-hm-hm

52:09.671 --> 52:15.460
I've gone to find my ain true love

52:36.114 --> 52:40.361
You're my angel, my butterfly.

52:41.912 --> 52:44.237
Come fly away.

52:47.125 --> 52:50.043
My love,,.

52:50.128 --> 52:53.082
God forgive me for doin' this.

52:53.173 --> 52:55.462
I'm so sorry.

52:55.551 --> 52:58.302
I'm sendin' you to a better place.

53:00.305 --> 53:03.176
You go fly away.

53:03.267 --> 53:05.093
Hey.

53:05.185 --> 53:10.227
Don't do that.  - Don't pull 
that trigger, I'm a man of God,

53:10.315 --> 53:14.812
I killed several of them,
- I mean I'm God's minister.

53:14.903 --> 53:18.948
What part of God's business is
throwin' a woman down a gorge?

53:19.032 --> 53:21.274
A slave woman.

53:21.368 --> 53:25.152
Can you see that in this
light? Black as a bucket of tar,

53:25.247 --> 53:28.164
Is she dead?
- No, I drugged her,

53:28.250 --> 53:30.492
like you would a butterfly.

53:30.586 --> 53:33.587
And I care for her, That's
the heartbreak of it.

53:34.381 --> 53:37.299
She's got my bastard in her belly.

53:37.384 --> 53:39.792
Come on, Back up,

53:42.055 --> 53:44.546
I'm beggin' you,
- Git.

53:44.641 --> 53:50.312
It's better you blow out my brains
than return me to this place.

53:51.231 --> 53:54.185
You're gonna put her
back where she sleeps.

53:55.402 --> 53:58.569
I do that, the members
will lynch me...

53:58.655 --> 54:03.282
for sirin' a bastard while servin' as
their preacher, We're a strict congregation.

54:03.368 --> 54:06.987
We've churched men for pickin'
up a fiddle on the Sabbath.

54:07.080 --> 54:09.916
So you reckon to kill her?
What, because she's a slave?

54:12.544 --> 54:14.252
I,,, um,,.

54:14.338 --> 54:16.663
There's a back door, Have pity.

54:19.009 --> 54:21.167
Thank you.

54:21.261 --> 54:23.966
I was gonna do a grievous wrong.

54:26.642 --> 54:29.559
I think I should go
back up to my wife.

54:31.146 --> 54:33.222
She wakes at the slightest noise.

54:33.315 --> 54:35.189
Agh. Ohh,,.

54:35.275 --> 54:37.268
Where's some paper and a pencil?

54:47.955 --> 54:51.655
Hey, Ada. You up?

54:53.794 --> 54:55.122
Yes.

54:55.212 --> 54:57.703
Wha,,,? It's still dark.

54:57.798 --> 55:00.668
Tell that to the cows, It's late.

55:07.432 --> 55:09.721
You all set?

55:09.810 --> 55:11.886
Oh, I-I just have to eat somethin'.

55:11.979 --> 55:14.896
Well, then, you got to get
up earlier, What's that?

55:16.900 --> 55:19.189
A novel.

55:19.278 --> 55:22.777
You wanna carry a book,
carry one you can write in.

55:24.116 --> 55:30.450
We got our own story, It's called
Black Cove Farm: Catastrophe.

55:31.415 --> 55:35.875
I can spell it, too, Learned it the
same place you did, in the schoolhouse.

55:35.961 --> 55:38.499
One of the first words they taught me,

55:38.589 --> 55:43.879
'Ruby Thewes, you are a
c- a-t-a-s-t-r-o-p-h-e,'

55:43.969 --> 55:46.923
Three years I was in
school, before my daddy,,.

55:47.014 --> 55:50.217
Sayin' God rest his soul is like
wishin' him what he had in life.

55:50.309 --> 55:53.096
He lived to rest, He was born tired.

55:53.187 --> 55:55.678
He decided,,, better use for me...

55:55.772 --> 55:59.355
than havin' me sat all day
in front of a chalkboard.

56:06.950 --> 56:12.324
Number one, lay out a winter
garden for cool-season crops.

56:12.414 --> 56:16.115
Turnips right there, onions, cabbage.

56:18.295 --> 56:19.458
Collards.

56:19.546 --> 56:23.164
Number two, patch the
shingles on the barn roof.

56:23.258 --> 56:25.547
Have we got a maul and froe?

56:25.636 --> 56:29.336
Maul? -
Maul, M-a-u-I.

56:29.431 --> 56:32.598
Number three, clear
and turn this field.

56:39.483 --> 56:43.066
No harm done lettin' it
go, Now we'll do well.

56:43.904 --> 56:44.983
Number 15,,,

56:45.072 --> 56:45.937
16,

56:46.031 --> 56:47.525
Number 16,,,
- Number 16,,.

56:47.616 --> 56:52.029
Put up some gourds for a martin
colony, Keep away these crows.

56:52.120 --> 56:57.197
One thing in abundance on this farm,
and that's crows, Shut the gate.

57:40.502 --> 57:43.207
I'd pay a dollar for an egg.

57:44.256 --> 57:46.794
I've got no quarrel with you.

57:46.884 --> 57:48.378
Hey.

57:49.386 --> 57:52.387
Am I near the Cape Fear River?

58:24.379 --> 58:27.416
Home Guard. Get back there.

58:27.508 --> 58:29.251
Runaways.

58:34.681 --> 58:36.721
Come on, boys.

58:37.893 --> 58:39.684
Let's get 'em.

58:39.770 --> 58:42.475
They're spreadin' out in the field.

58:46.693 --> 58:48.816
Come back here.
- They're in the field.

58:48.904 --> 58:51.027
They're in the field.

59:01.208 --> 59:03.497
I can get you outta here.

59:09.174 --> 59:12.211
I daresay that's Home
Guard followin' you.

59:12.302 --> 59:16.134
They're out on the road,
huntin' down deserters.

59:16.223 --> 59:18.512
And I don't recommend that way.

59:18.600 --> 59:22.468
You'll meet half the town comin'
after me with a noose, thanks to you.

59:22.563 --> 59:25.267
I should have shot you
when I had the chance.

59:25.357 --> 59:29.770
I know where there's a ferry crossin',
Or you can stubborn yourself to death,

59:31.113 --> 59:36.736
If this is a trap,,,
- Please yourself, I'm just bein' a Christian,

59:36.827 --> 59:39.400
You got any money?
- $5.

59:39.496 --> 59:43.079
For $5 I wouldn't give a parched
man a dipper of this river water.

59:43.167 --> 59:45.289
The sign says 'Ferry $5,'

59:45.377 --> 59:50.335
Nobody crosses these waters unless
they're runnin' from someplace.

59:51.258 --> 59:53.714
You wanna wait for your friends?

59:53.802 --> 59:55.961
I can give you $30 Confederate.

59:56.054 --> 59:58.380
Well, all right, let's go.

59:58.474 --> 01:00:00.431
Whatever that's worth.

01:00:05.439 --> 01:00:07.431
They cut off my hair.

01:00:08.817 --> 01:00:11.439
That was hard.

01:00:11.528 --> 01:00:13.604
I was vain about my hair.

01:00:14.406 --> 01:00:16.897
I had curls.

01:00:17.618 --> 01:00:20.369
But I deserved it.

01:00:20.454 --> 01:00:25.246
I'm the Reverend Veasey,
Have I seen you in church?

01:00:25.334 --> 01:00:28.121
No, Not likely to, neither.

01:00:28.212 --> 01:00:32.541
I'd say these days, the
devil rules the roost,

01:00:35.385 --> 01:00:37.674
30 more dollars, we can
go over to that cabin...

01:00:37.763 --> 01:00:40.883
and I can pull this
dress over my head.

01:00:43.101 --> 01:00:45.390
Have we got $30?

01:00:47.314 --> 01:00:51.228
Get down.
- I got one,

01:00:59.493 --> 01:01:03.538
Is there any other way to cross?
- Barge or boat, The water's full of gators.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.033
What's this wood?

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:09.663
I don't know,
- In,

01:01:10.504 --> 01:01:11.963
I don't know,
- Pine,

01:01:12.047 --> 01:01:15.546
Locust?
- Pine, Where's north?

01:01:15.634 --> 01:01:18.670
North? Uh,,.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.349
Name me three herbs that
grow wild on this farm.

01:01:22.432 --> 01:01:24.805
I can't, I can't, all right?

01:01:26.228 --> 01:01:29.597
I can talk about farming in Latin.

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:33.272
I can,,, I can read French.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.195
I know how to lace up
a corset, God knows.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.356
I can name the principal
rivers in Europe.

01:01:38.448 --> 01:01:42.067
Just don't ask me to name
one stream in this county.

01:01:42.161 --> 01:01:45.245
I can,,, I can embroider
but I can't darn.

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:49.410
I can arrange cut flowers
but I can't grow them.

01:01:51.628 --> 01:01:54.582
If a thing has a function, if
I might do something with it,

01:01:54.673 --> 01:01:58.042
then it wasn't considered suitable.

01:02:00.387 --> 01:02:02.463
Why?

01:02:04.516 --> 01:02:08.846
Ruby, you can ask why about pretty
much everything to do with me.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:16.270
This fence is about the first
thing that I've ever done...

01:02:16.361 --> 01:02:19.446
that might produce an actual result.

01:02:30.125 --> 01:02:33.660
So you never wrapped your
legs around this Inman?

01:02:34.671 --> 01:02:36.498
Oh.

01:02:40.052 --> 01:02:42.128
Come on.

01:03:27.141 --> 01:03:28.683
Fine piano.

01:03:54.585 --> 01:03:58.203
If we're careful, now
we'll get through winter.

01:03:58.297 --> 01:04:00.704
I got old man Roy to
give me ten of them sheep,

01:04:00.799 --> 01:04:03.006
on account of I said they's so small,

01:04:03.093 --> 01:04:06.794
put together they weren't no
bigger than six proper sheep.

01:04:06.889 --> 01:04:09.925
My father always wanted
sheep on this farm.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.928
I cut off my hair once for money.

01:04:16.023 --> 01:04:21.610
My daddy got $ 2 for it, Made a
wig for some rich feller in Raleigh.

01:04:24.239 --> 01:04:27.324
I'm just sayin' I'm real sorry
you had to lose your piano.

01:04:27.409 --> 01:04:29.366
Ruby, it was my idea.

01:04:29.453 --> 01:04:32.537
Stobrod liked to call
himself a musician.

01:04:32.623 --> 01:04:37.166
My daddy, He could play
six tunes on a fiddle.

01:04:37.252 --> 01:04:40.787
Got hisself shot dead at Petersburg.

01:04:41.715 --> 01:04:44.336
I was like his goat.

01:04:44.426 --> 01:04:46.882
Or some critter tethered to a post.

01:04:50.724 --> 01:04:53.678
He left me once, Up in them mountains.

01:04:53.769 --> 01:04:56.176
I was eight, He was gone
over two and a half weeks.

01:04:56.271 --> 01:04:58.643
He left you?

01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:04.194
Uh-huh, I was all right.

01:05:04.279 --> 01:05:10.115
My daddy, he'd walk 40 miles for
liquor and not 40 inches for kindness.

01:05:12.204 --> 01:05:14.909
I'm so plugged up.

01:05:14.998 --> 01:05:18.663
Used to be as regular
as morning prayers.

01:05:18.752 --> 01:05:22.417
Matter of fact, I could
set my watch by my bowels.

01:05:23.966 --> 01:05:30.633
Open my gut now, they'd find turds
stacked up like little black twigs.

01:05:31.723 --> 01:05:33.965
Home Guard.

01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:49.941
Hey,
- Shh,

01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:52.987
Look at this,
- Keep your voice down.

01:05:54.204 --> 01:05:56.197
Look at this.

01:05:58.083 --> 01:06:00.788
It's a good saw.
- And it's not yours.

01:06:02.129 --> 01:06:06.079
You're a Christian, Don't
you know your Commandments?

01:06:07.092 --> 01:06:11.837
You'll find the good Lord very
flexible on the subject of property.

01:06:13.182 --> 01:06:15.886
We could do a lot with this saw.

01:06:15.976 --> 01:06:20.056
Cut down a tree, Play music with it.

01:06:21.565 --> 01:06:23.890
You're gonna thank me for this saw.

01:06:23.984 --> 01:06:27.816
I'll say thank you when I've
lost you and I've found some food.

01:06:27.905 --> 01:06:29.981
You'll see, You'll thank me.

01:06:41.418 --> 01:06:43.327
Shh.

01:06:48.091 --> 01:06:50.131
Good day to you.

01:06:56.975 --> 01:07:02.218
My old bull,,, wandered off,,
, and died in this here creek.

01:07:02.314 --> 01:07:05.849
Poisonin' up our water
is how I found him.

01:07:09.196 --> 01:07:11.769
Thank you, You are a true Christian,

01:07:13.325 --> 01:07:17.904
That's a rank odour from that animal,
- Been dead a good while, I reckon.

01:07:18.872 --> 01:07:21.328
This is a tricky one.

01:07:23.502 --> 01:07:27.796
You fellers help me out, my
woman'll cook you up a good dinner.

01:07:27.881 --> 01:07:30.170
I'm gettin' an idea.

01:07:31.677 --> 01:07:34.002
My saw's the remedy.

01:07:34.096 --> 01:07:37.512
I believe you need two
people, one on either end.

01:07:37.599 --> 01:07:39.093
Yeah.

01:07:39.184 --> 01:07:41.177
Give me that saw.

01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:48.520
Let's do this in chapters,

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:50.235
That's right,
- Yeah.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:53.108
Start at the neck.

01:07:53.615 --> 01:07:55.572
Aw,,,.

01:07:58.162 --> 01:08:00.866
Oh, well,,, That is unpleasant.

01:08:02.583 --> 01:08:04.955
There's my place.

01:08:05.043 --> 01:08:08.626
Hope you can stomach a
yard chock full of female.

01:08:08.714 --> 01:08:11.668
Oh, God, Oh, my God.

01:08:11.758 --> 01:08:13.336
Hallelujah.

01:08:13.427 --> 01:08:18.468
Hallelujah. Oh,
hallelujah. The Israelites.

01:08:18.557 --> 01:08:20.051
What happened?

01:08:20.142 --> 01:08:22.265
He's got a shit comin', It's overdue.

01:08:22.352 --> 01:08:28.142
The tribes of Israel are about
to flee from the banks of Egypt.

01:08:29.151 --> 01:08:30.859
Good God.

01:08:30.944 --> 01:08:33.779
These boys are stoppin' for supper.

01:08:39.828 --> 01:08:41.370
Brought my woman home,

01:08:41.455 --> 01:08:45.951
she showed up with her three
sisters, so-called, and their brats.

01:08:46.042 --> 01:08:48.285
That's Mae, Dolly, Shyla,

01:08:48.377 --> 01:08:51.214
and the pretty one in
blue is my wife, Lila.

01:08:53.716 --> 01:08:55.923
Those are fine examples of the female.

01:09:12.653 --> 01:09:15.607
Oh, I'm about to pass out.

01:09:15.697 --> 01:09:21.202
My home brew sneaks up on
you, It curdles your durdles.

01:09:21.286 --> 01:09:23.777
Oh, Oh, look, He's gone now.

01:09:23.872 --> 01:09:25.865
Look, He's gone now.

01:09:26.707 --> 01:09:28.747
His eyes, they've gone,

01:09:28.836 --> 01:09:31.706
His eyes are gone,
- What?

01:09:31.796 --> 01:09:35.795
Gone, gone, gone, gone.

01:09:39.345 --> 01:09:43.390
I'm leavin' soon as I'm full,
Y'all havin' too much fun for me.

01:09:43.475 --> 01:09:45.267
Really? Goodbye.

01:09:45.352 --> 01:09:48.970
Well, yeah, I got a bunch
of traps need visitin',

01:09:49.064 --> 01:09:52.682
but I'll be back before,,
, before dark tomorrow,

01:09:52.776 --> 01:09:56.311
Y'all still be here?
- That's my fervent prayer.

01:09:56.405 --> 01:10:00.189
I'll say my goodbyes, I gotta go.

01:10:00.284 --> 01:10:06.998
I got miles and miles and miles and miles
ahead of me before I reach the Blue Ridge.

01:10:07.082 --> 01:10:09.324
Blue Ridge? What's the hurry?

01:10:09.418 --> 01:10:12.787
Maybe I will just lie down a moment,
- Yeah,

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.542
This house is on a bit of a tilt,
- Yeah, it is a bit crooked.

01:10:21.638 --> 01:10:23.298
Lie down.

01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:25.466
What about you, Reverend?

01:10:26.977 --> 01:10:29.978
I'm headin' for that smokehouse.

01:10:30.063 --> 01:10:32.389
And I'm ready to be
washed clean of my dirt,

01:10:32.483 --> 01:10:35.437
Yeah, Mae, you go
tend to him, - Mm-hm.

01:10:35.527 --> 01:10:36.558
All right.

01:10:36.653 --> 01:10:39.227
Y'all get to bed.

01:10:39.323 --> 01:10:41.778
Everybody else got their job,

01:10:41.867 --> 01:10:43.860
Come on, get to bed,
- Now?

01:10:43.952 --> 01:10:47.487
Everybody to bed, Lila,
you stay with them kids.

01:10:47.581 --> 01:10:49.823
Get on up those stairs.

01:10:49.917 --> 01:10:51.743
I'll be seein' you.

01:10:52.544 --> 01:10:55.581
Look,,.

01:10:55.672 --> 01:10:59.717
He's mine, You go rub
yourself off on the preacher.

01:10:59.843 --> 01:11:03.378
I'm gonna make him
hug me till I grunt.

01:11:03.472 --> 01:11:06.224
He's purty, ain't he?

01:11:07.142 --> 01:11:09.218
Git.

01:11:09.311 --> 01:11:12.312
She ain't even supposed to get a man.

01:11:14.483 --> 01:11:16.559
Hey.

01:11:23.992 --> 01:11:26.068
I know, I know.

01:11:27.663 --> 01:11:29.655
I,,.

01:11:30.916 --> 01:11:32.909
How about that?

01:11:33.001 --> 01:11:35.872
What does that favour?
- I,,,

01:11:37.673 --> 01:11:40.709
,, gotta go,
- Get on.

01:11:40.801 --> 01:11:45.130
And ride me all the way to China.

01:11:57.985 --> 01:11:59.395
You shy?

01:11:59.486 --> 01:12:02.156
Do you need a hand?
- No, Uh,,.

01:12:02.239 --> 01:12:05.489
Let's have a look and
see what we can muster.

01:12:06.285 --> 01:12:09.239
Oh, no, Look what you made me do.

01:12:11.456 --> 01:12:13.330
Slut.

01:12:13.417 --> 01:12:15.575
Home Guard.

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:17.412
Cover yourself up.

01:12:17.504 --> 01:12:20.256
I told you, you don't touch the money.

01:12:25.262 --> 01:12:29.260
I had a special prayer
you'd come visit,

01:12:29.349 --> 01:12:31.307
Get up,
- Evenin', Hank.

01:12:31.393 --> 01:12:33.101
Evenin', Hank,

01:12:33.812 --> 01:12:36.849
You took your time,
- I said get up.

01:12:38.192 --> 01:12:41.940
Get in line, You fools
fall for it every time.

01:12:43.864 --> 01:12:47.031
God will judge you, you Judas,

01:12:47.117 --> 01:12:50.486
Thanks,
- God will judge you.

01:12:50.579 --> 01:12:55.241
Move out.
- Our lives are on your rotten soul,

01:12:55.334 --> 01:12:57.125
Mister?
- Your rotten soul.

01:12:57.211 --> 01:12:59.203
Shut your mouth.

01:13:01.131 --> 01:13:04.002
Pleasure doin' business with you, boys,
- Judas.

01:13:04.092 --> 01:13:05.752
Save your breath.

01:13:05.844 --> 01:13:08.631
You got a long walk
back to the fightin'.

01:13:14.061 --> 01:13:17.145
Ada Monroe and Ruby
Thewes, look at you both.

01:13:17.231 --> 01:13:18.559
Look at us both what?

01:13:18.649 --> 01:13:21.187
Like a couple of scarecrows
after a thunderstorm.

01:13:21.276 --> 01:13:25.488
We need a scarecrow, Birds done
ate up half our winter garden.

01:13:25.572 --> 01:13:29.522
For all your kindness,
coffee,,, and a pie.

01:13:29.618 --> 01:13:35.241
Yeah, and that's real coffee, It ain't chicory
and dirt, Found a sack hid in the larder.

01:13:35.332 --> 01:13:38.001
Mmm, Thank you both.

01:13:38.085 --> 01:13:42.083
Ruby, I look forward
to this, We all do.

01:13:42.172 --> 01:13:43.750
Esco and me,

01:13:44.508 --> 01:13:47.592
She made it,
- I made it.

01:13:49.304 --> 01:13:51.511
Good God in heaven.

01:13:51.598 --> 01:13:54.350
I'm still livin'.

01:13:54.434 --> 01:13:58.847
Well, I know Esco's gonna
be real sorry he missed you.

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:11.731
Yep,

01:14:16.415 --> 01:14:19.332
Strike you as odd?
- What?

01:14:19.418 --> 01:14:23.878
Stood at her front door,
- I know.

01:14:23.964 --> 01:14:28.044
Number one, I knowed that woman all my
life, I never stood outside her house.

01:14:28.135 --> 01:14:31.338
She'd let a wolf in if
it knocked at the door.

01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:33.173
Perhaps,,.

01:14:33.265 --> 01:14:35.554
I don't know, Perhaps she was busy.

01:14:35.642 --> 01:14:41.478
Number two, old man Swanger's inside that
house, I could smell his pipe burnin',

01:14:41.565 --> 01:14:46.143
Number three, look at them fields,
- What about them?

01:14:46.236 --> 01:14:50.400
We come by here a week ago
and they was waist-high in hay.

01:14:50.491 --> 01:14:54.702
You tellin' me that's work
for one old man and his dog?

01:15:02.586 --> 01:15:04.744
Yankees. Yankees.

01:15:04.838 --> 01:15:07.460
Cavalry. Federal raiders.

01:15:07.549 --> 01:15:09.589
Just over that hill,

01:15:09.676 --> 01:15:12.677
Get those sacks of shit up that hill,
- Come on.

01:15:20.312 --> 01:15:24.891
Get those horses under cover,
If they see us, we're dead.

01:15:25.567 --> 01:15:28.402
Make a move, make a noise,,.

01:16:02.187 --> 01:16:04.559
I'm gettin' out of this.

01:16:04.648 --> 01:16:09.061
I'm not gettin' shot again for
some cause I don't believe in.

01:16:09.153 --> 01:16:10.896
Come on, let's go.

01:16:10.988 --> 01:16:12.815
Come on, They can't shoot, Come on.

01:16:17.077 --> 01:16:18.904
Keep goin'. Come on.

01:16:18.996 --> 01:16:21.072
Bayonets.

01:16:22.708 --> 01:16:24.416
Come on.

01:16:54.239 --> 01:16:58.700
Grab their boots and
rifles. Let's move on.

01:16:58.785 --> 01:17:00.825
Let's go.

01:17:16.428 --> 01:17:20.177
That scarecrow ain't gonna
frighten off no Yankee.

01:17:20.265 --> 01:17:22.887
Or are you tryin' to
make a man for yourself?

01:17:22.976 --> 01:17:24.554
No.

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:30.478
I come by,,, a few days.

01:17:30.567 --> 01:17:33.023
I don't pass by,

01:17:33.111 --> 01:17:36.362
Lookin' out for you,
- I know.

01:17:38.116 --> 01:17:40.193
I see you,

01:17:41.495 --> 01:17:44.745
And I don't like it,
- Where's your little servant girl?

01:17:44.832 --> 01:17:48.699
Ruby, She tradin' off more
of your daddy's silver?

01:17:48.794 --> 01:17:51.249
Stop it.
- Her nose is in the butter.

01:17:51.338 --> 01:17:54.007
Her nose is right in your butter.

01:18:03.851 --> 01:18:06.389
This farm's got my name on it.

01:18:06.478 --> 01:18:10.061
You listenin', woman? You're
gonna need more than a scarecrow.

01:19:38.487 --> 01:19:40.479
Sal.

01:19:51.083 --> 01:19:53.159
Afternoon.

01:19:55.128 --> 01:19:58.580
Don't spread out, Why
are they spreadin' out?

01:19:58.674 --> 01:20:01.295
I never seen a man work a
field with a shotgun before.

01:20:01.385 --> 01:20:02.760
There's a war on.

01:20:02.845 --> 01:20:04.921
Get off my land,

01:20:05.848 --> 01:20:09.299
Your boys come home?
- Ain't seen my boys in four years.

01:20:09.393 --> 01:20:12.062
They're out fightin' other
boys, not old men and women.

01:20:12.146 --> 01:20:14.897
So you won't mind if we look around?

01:20:14.982 --> 01:20:17.224
'Cause we think they're here.

01:20:17.317 --> 01:20:20.022
We think you've got
'em hid up somewhere.

01:20:20.112 --> 01:20:24.275
What I gotta give you? Chicken? Lamb?

01:20:25.742 --> 01:20:27.367
Sure.

01:20:27.452 --> 01:20:30.619
The thing is, you've
only got one barrel.

01:20:30.706 --> 01:20:34.454
And there's five of us,
That's not a fair fight.

01:20:38.088 --> 01:20:40.294
King of kings.

01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:42.462
Hey.

01:20:43.886 --> 01:20:44.917
What was that?

01:20:45.762 --> 01:20:47.305
Aargh.

01:20:48.974 --> 01:20:52.841
You're harbouring deserters, I could
confiscate this farm and everything on it.

01:20:52.936 --> 01:20:56.103
Every plate, every sheep, every
little pellet of chickenshit.

01:20:56.190 --> 01:20:58.431
I could confiscate
your old lady's asshole.

01:20:58.525 --> 01:21:00.269
So don't you offer me no bird.

01:21:23.008 --> 01:21:25.879
Come on, boys.

01:21:25.969 --> 01:21:27.796
Mama's callin'.

01:21:36.021 --> 01:21:37.017
Mama.

01:21:37.105 --> 01:21:39.941
No.

01:21:40.025 --> 01:21:42.563
Mama. Mama.

01:21:44.238 --> 01:21:46.776
No.

01:22:23.569 --> 01:22:26.320
Buggery and shit.

01:22:26.405 --> 01:22:32.028
If I'da known you were this heavy,
I'da left you in those chains.

01:22:50.846 --> 01:22:52.885
Sally.

01:22:53.599 --> 01:22:55.223
No.

01:22:56.059 --> 01:22:58.135
No.

01:22:59.688 --> 01:23:01.147
Oh, God, Sally?

01:23:01.231 --> 01:23:02.560
Ada.

01:23:04.193 --> 01:23:06.185
All right, all right.

01:23:08.822 --> 01:23:10.981
Darlin', what?

01:23:11.825 --> 01:23:14.826
She's sayin' 'Don't bother'. Go.

01:23:19.124 --> 01:23:21.247
Get her neck.

01:23:21.335 --> 01:23:23.908
Sally.
- Get her neck.

01:23:27.633 --> 01:23:31.084
This world won't stand long.

01:23:31.178 --> 01:23:33.254
God won't let it,,,

01:23:34.431 --> 01:23:37.432
stand this way long,

01:23:42.731 --> 01:23:48.686
How long have I been sleepin'?
- Two days, three days, Not long enough,

01:23:48.779 --> 01:23:52.693
I can't stop here,
- Sit down before you fall down.

01:23:52.783 --> 01:23:55.404
I'm a deserter.

01:23:55.494 --> 01:23:58.827
If they find me here,
things could be bad for you.

01:23:58.914 --> 01:24:01.535
What are they gonna do?
Cut short my young life?

01:24:10.425 --> 01:24:14.044
I've learned a person can pretty
much survive off of a goat.

01:24:14.138 --> 01:24:17.008
A goat gives you company,

01:24:17.099 --> 01:24:18.890
and milk,

01:24:18.976 --> 01:24:20.719
and cheese,

01:24:20.811 --> 01:24:23.563
and, when you need it,

01:24:23.647 --> 01:24:25.438
good meat.

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.353
That's my beauty.

01:24:30.654 --> 01:24:32.860
There's my beauty.

01:24:33.490 --> 01:24:36.064
So you been fightin'.

01:24:38.829 --> 01:24:41.664
I could be at killin',,,

01:24:41.748 --> 01:24:43.408
for days,

01:24:44.585 --> 01:24:48.001
my feet against the feet of my enemy.

01:24:49.089 --> 01:24:51.378
And I always killed him.

01:24:55.095 --> 01:24:56.887
He never killed me.

01:24:56.972 --> 01:25:00.471
I don't know why.

01:25:00.559 --> 01:25:03.595
Gave it a try, to look at ya.

01:25:05.397 --> 01:25:07.390
Yeah, I guess he did.

01:25:07.483 --> 01:25:09.190
See, I think there's a plan.

01:25:09.276 --> 01:25:11.767
There's a design for
each and every one of us.

01:25:11.862 --> 01:25:13.486
You look at nature.

01:25:13.572 --> 01:25:18.317
Bird flies somewhere, picks up a
seed, shits the seed out, plant grows.

01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:22.360
Bird's got a job, shit's
got a job, seed's got a job.

01:25:25.209 --> 01:25:28.328
And you've got a job.

01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:30.745
You done good, goat.

01:25:31.882 --> 01:25:34.207
You were a real beauty.

01:25:46.438 --> 01:25:50.187
Sometimes I think I'm
crazy when I'm just hungry.

01:25:50.275 --> 01:25:54.984
Now drink this, It eases
the pain, and you'll sleep.

01:26:02.287 --> 01:26:06.237
Is she waitin' for
ya, this Ada Monroe?

01:26:06.333 --> 01:26:08.539
She was.

01:26:08.627 --> 01:26:11.379
I don't know.

01:26:11.463 --> 01:26:14.797
Or even if she knows me.

01:26:14.883 --> 01:26:17.635
Lie down.

01:26:17.719 --> 01:26:19.795
I'm like the boy who
goes for wood in winter...

01:26:19.888 --> 01:26:23.055
and comes back in
spring with a whistle.

01:26:24.268 --> 01:26:28.597
Like every fool sent off to
fight with a flag and a lie.

01:26:31.441 --> 01:26:36.068
That's the laudanum
gettin' to ya, That's good.

01:26:36.155 --> 01:26:38.194
Say somethin' more.

01:26:42.911 --> 01:26:44.987
She got me a book.

01:26:46.415 --> 01:26:48.372
Ada Monroe.

01:26:50.794 --> 01:26:53.083
A man by the name of Bartram.

01:26:55.090 --> 01:26:57.249
He wrote about his travels.

01:26:58.302 --> 01:27:00.840
Sometimes,,,

01:27:00.929 --> 01:27:04.014
just readin' the name of a place,,,

01:27:05.184 --> 01:27:07.260
near home,,.

01:27:11.356 --> 01:27:13.432
Sorell Cove.

01:27:15.068 --> 01:27:17.191
Bishop's Creek.

01:27:18.739 --> 01:27:22.190
Those places belonged
to people before us.

01:27:23.410 --> 01:27:25.403
To the Cherokee.

01:27:25.496 --> 01:27:29.624
What did he call Cold Mountain?

01:27:32.044 --> 01:27:37.584
How could a name,,,
not even a real name,,,

01:27:39.718 --> 01:27:42.090
break your heart?

01:27:46.225 --> 01:27:48.217
It's her.

01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:53.929
She's the place I'm headin'.

01:27:55.818 --> 01:27:59.898
And I hardly know
her, I hardly know her.

01:28:03.909 --> 01:28:07.527
And I just can't seem
to get back to her,

01:28:12.125 --> 01:28:16.752
'To have travelled so
far, from east to west,

01:28:16.839 --> 01:28:19.127
a thousand terrible miles.'

01:28:19.216 --> 01:28:21.125
I have to close my eyes,

01:28:21.218 --> 01:28:24.172
'My feet treadin' all God's surface

01:28:24.263 --> 01:28:28.557
'his ocean, his swamps, his slopes and ridges

01:28:28.642 --> 01:28:34.597
'to find myself, at last,
a mark in the aching snow,

01:28:34.690 --> 01:28:37.311
'from whence I beheld
through a blue haze...

01:28:37.401 --> 01:28:41.445
a world of mountains
piled upon mountains,'

01:28:42.364 --> 01:28:44.357
Ada.

01:28:45.784 --> 01:28:47.777
Ada.

01:28:52.249 --> 01:28:54.242
It's a man.
- What is?

01:28:54.334 --> 01:28:59.043
Raidin' our corncrib. Got him
in the trap. That's him yelpin'.

01:29:00.591 --> 01:29:03.295
Help.
- Here.

01:29:03.385 --> 01:29:07.003
Help. Damn.

01:29:07.097 --> 01:29:09.173
Listen up.

01:29:09.266 --> 01:29:10.844
You got,,, Aim.

01:29:10.934 --> 01:29:13.306
You got a barrel
trained on your rear end.

01:29:13.395 --> 01:29:16.479
Get me outta this dang thing.
- You got a weapon?

01:29:16.565 --> 01:29:21.725
No, ma'am, I'm,,, My
fists are about to drop off.

01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:25.023
Unbelievable,

01:29:25.115 --> 01:29:28.235
Stobrod Thewes.
- Ruby?

01:29:29.077 --> 01:29:31.913
Agh.

01:29:33.832 --> 01:29:35.908
That's my daddy.

01:29:37.544 --> 01:29:40.415
Just so's you know, I can
eat while she's doin' this.

01:29:40.506 --> 01:29:43.376
Just so's you know,
you ain't eatin' inside.

01:29:43.467 --> 01:29:48.378
Number one, they hang people
round here for takin' in deserters.

01:29:48.472 --> 01:29:52.470
Number two, even if they
was givin' out prizes,

01:29:52.559 --> 01:29:55.229
you'd still eat outside,

01:29:55.312 --> 01:29:57.518
You're scarred,
- I'm what?

01:29:57.606 --> 01:30:00.441
Your heart, Scarred,
I did wrong to ya.

01:30:00.526 --> 01:30:04.773
You'd be scarred, You'd be real scarred if
I hadn't wrapped them trap teeth in sackin',

01:30:04.863 --> 01:30:08.481
Which was my idea,
- Which was her idea,

01:30:09.535 --> 01:30:12.701
I hurt you,
- Good God.

01:30:12.788 --> 01:30:15.991
I made up 50 tunes with you in mind.

01:30:16.083 --> 01:30:19.203
Ruby this, Ruby that, Ruby
with the eyes that sparkle.

01:30:19.294 --> 01:30:22.129
Hey. Let's agree.

01:30:22.214 --> 01:30:26.377
You beat me, you abandoned
me, you ignored me,

01:30:26.468 --> 01:30:28.046
then you beat me some more.

01:30:28.137 --> 01:30:32.633
And all of that is better'n
'Ruby with the eyes that sparkle,'

01:30:32.724 --> 01:30:35.560
I'm changed, People change.

01:30:35.644 --> 01:30:37.637
War changes people somethin' terrible.

01:30:37.729 --> 01:30:40.481
Ruby's told you, I've no
doubt, I wasn't always the best.

01:30:40.566 --> 01:30:42.605
You were an asshole.

01:30:42.693 --> 01:30:44.899
I can't disagree with that, I was,

01:30:45.654 --> 01:30:49.355
Would you get him outta here?
- Music's changed me.

01:30:49.449 --> 01:30:51.407
I'm full of music, Ruby.

01:30:51.493 --> 01:30:53.569
I wish I'd brung my fiddle.

01:30:53.662 --> 01:30:55.951
Hey, Ruby, I got a new fiddle.

01:30:56.039 --> 01:31:01.663
Oh, it's a beautiful fiddle, It's full of
tunes, Ruby, I didn't know I had it in me,

01:31:01.753 --> 01:31:04.838
You're all set,
- I,,.

01:31:12.639 --> 01:31:15.213
Bless you both.

01:31:17.936 --> 01:31:19.976
All right, then.

01:31:25.277 --> 01:31:27.353
Ain't you got a proper coat?

01:31:28.322 --> 01:31:32.900
Aw, darlin', I'm fine, you know, And you
just say the word, I won't come back neither.

01:31:32.993 --> 01:31:35.828
Don't wanna put you or your
mistress here in any bother.

01:31:35.913 --> 01:31:38.617
I'm not Ruby's employer.

01:31:38.707 --> 01:31:40.616
Oh, Beg pardon.

01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:42.500
Nobody is.

01:31:42.586 --> 01:31:44.662
Oh.

01:31:52.805 --> 01:31:56.588
You know who really needs a coat, darlin'?
My partner, Fat boy name of Pangle.

01:31:56.683 --> 01:31:59.471
We're hidin' up in a cave
with a singer from Georgia,

01:31:59.561 --> 01:32:04.437
and Pangle, he feels the cold like a thin
man, but there ain't no coat'll fit him.

01:32:08.862 --> 01:32:10.143
I love you, Ruby.

01:32:12.991 --> 01:32:16.443
In case the sky falls on our head.

01:32:16.537 --> 01:32:19.206
You always were a good girl.

01:32:29.424 --> 01:32:34.632
Ooh. He's so full of manure, that man.

01:32:34.721 --> 01:32:38.470
We could lay him in the dirt and,,
, grow another one just like him.

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:42.514
That's medicine, that's goat meat.

01:32:43.856 --> 01:32:45.932
And you're sick of both.

01:32:46.024 --> 01:32:49.393
I have a deal to thank you for.

01:32:49.486 --> 01:32:52.238
That's just for show.

01:33:46.418 --> 01:33:48.874
Ruby with the eyes that sparkle

01:34:02.267 --> 01:34:04.841
Get on back where you came from.

01:34:04.937 --> 01:34:07.392
Thank you for my coat.
- Thanks for the food.

01:34:07.481 --> 01:34:10.565
Git.
- Ruby with the eyes that sparkle.

01:34:10.651 --> 01:34:14.731
I love my coat.

01:34:27.042 --> 01:34:31.669
'My love for Linton is like
the foliage in the woods.

01:34:31.755 --> 01:34:37.260
'Time will change it, I'm well
aware, as winter changes the trees.

01:34:37.344 --> 01:34:42.587
'My love for Heathcliff resembles
the eternal rocks beneath.

01:34:43.559 --> 01:34:46.595
'A source of little visible delight,

01:34:46.687 --> 01:34:48.893
'but necessary,

01:34:50.190 --> 01:34:52.515
'He's always,,,

01:34:53.652 --> 01:34:55.645
always in my mind,'

01:34:55.737 --> 01:34:58.110
She ain't gonna marry Linton, is she?

01:34:58.198 --> 01:35:02.492
You can't say that about
Heathcliff and then marry Linton.

01:35:02.578 --> 01:35:03.906
Hmm.

01:35:03.996 --> 01:35:06.913
We'll find out.

01:35:09.626 --> 01:35:11.833
Tomorrow.

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:15.254
I'm not waitin' till tomorrow.

01:35:16.008 --> 01:35:17.751
Ruby,,,

01:35:17.843 --> 01:35:22.386
'A source of,,,
little visible delight,

01:35:23.557 --> 01:35:26.474
but,,, necessary,'

01:35:29.897 --> 01:35:33.016
I like that.

01:35:59.927 --> 01:36:03.971
I'm a Confederate
soldier,,, on furlough.

01:36:04.056 --> 01:36:07.140
I need shelter,,, and food.

01:36:17.861 --> 01:36:20.150
I've got a rifle.

01:36:21.073 --> 01:36:22.947
Fair enough.

01:36:24.284 --> 01:36:26.740
I have some beans and corn pone.

01:36:26.829 --> 01:36:28.987
All I got,

01:36:36.129 --> 01:36:38.418
Thank you,
- I'm alone here,

01:36:38.507 --> 01:36:41.045
as you can see, with my baby.

01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:43.881
I need to believe you mean no harm.

01:36:47.641 --> 01:36:49.468
No.

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:51.766
I don't want it.

01:36:51.854 --> 01:36:55.519
If I had my way, they'd take
metal altogether out of this world.

01:36:55.607 --> 01:36:58.063
Every blade, every gun.

01:37:12.875 --> 01:37:14.748
It's all right.

01:37:14.835 --> 01:37:17.836
You're burnin' up, little man.

01:37:34.313 --> 01:37:36.352
Is your baby sick?

01:37:39.318 --> 01:37:44.560
My man's dead, Took his wound at
Gettysburg and never saw his boy.

01:37:44.656 --> 01:37:45.854
I'm sorry.

01:37:45.949 --> 01:37:49.864
It's pretty much what you'll get if
you knock on any door of this war.

01:37:49.953 --> 01:37:52.740
Man dead, woman left.

01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:58.912
It's mean food, but it's hot.

01:37:59.004 --> 01:38:02.788
There's been no huntin' on
the road, just cress and roots.

01:38:02.883 --> 01:38:05.919
I need to try and feed this man.

01:38:06.011 --> 01:38:09.843
Shh, You gotta eat somethin', baby.

01:38:23.362 --> 01:38:25.935
He won't feed.

01:38:26.031 --> 01:38:29.530
I'm Inman, by the way, That's my name.

01:38:31.036 --> 01:38:33.112
I'm Sara.

01:38:36.041 --> 01:38:39.077
My baby's Ethan.

01:38:39.169 --> 01:38:40.580
Glad to know you both.

01:38:53.559 --> 01:38:56.678
You look about his size.

01:38:56.770 --> 01:39:00.020
He was another man
straight up and down.

01:39:00.107 --> 01:39:02.099
Thank you.

01:39:29.011 --> 01:39:30.719
Everything fit?

01:39:32.347 --> 01:39:34.554
These boots are good boots.

01:39:41.732 --> 01:39:44.223
Well, I'll say good night, then.

01:39:45.986 --> 01:39:47.979
Good night.

01:40:02.544 --> 01:40:04.620
Wake up, gals, let's go to the river

01:40:04.713 --> 01:40:06.919
Wake up, gals, let's go to the river

01:40:07.007 --> 01:40:09.379
Wake up, gals, let's go to the river

01:40:09.468 --> 01:40:11.710
Then we'll join the band

01:40:11.804 --> 01:40:16.264
Christmastime will soon be over,
Christmastime will soon be over

01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:21.012
Christmastime will soon be
over, then we'll join the band...

01:40:21.104 --> 01:40:23.940
She don't speak?
- Can't speak. I told you.

01:40:24.024 --> 01:40:26.349
Well, is she feeble, then?

01:40:26.443 --> 01:40:28.685
No.

01:40:28.779 --> 01:40:30.024
Never mind him.

01:40:30.113 --> 01:40:32.402
Get up, gals, don't be bitter

01:40:32.491 --> 01:40:34.697
Get up, gals, don't be bitter

01:40:34.785 --> 01:40:36.943
Get up, girls, don't be bitter

01:40:37.037 --> 01:40:39.195
Then we'll join the band

01:40:52.928 --> 01:40:55.004
Will you come inside?

01:41:18.162 --> 01:41:24.579
Would you do somethin' for me?
Do you,,, think you could,,,

01:41:24.668 --> 01:41:29.413
lie here next to me and
not,,, need to go further?

01:42:40.869 --> 01:42:44.119
I'll go, I'll go, shall I?
- No.

01:42:44.915 --> 01:42:47.204
I don't want you to.

01:42:52.965 --> 01:42:54.957
Thing is,,.

01:42:57.886 --> 01:43:00.211
I love someone.

01:43:05.769 --> 01:43:08.177
I love someone very much.

01:43:26.665 --> 01:43:28.788
Try and sleep.

01:43:47.227 --> 01:43:54.642
I know dark clouds will hover o'er me

01:43:54.735 --> 01:44:02.481
I know my pathway is rough and steep

01:44:02.576 --> 01:44:09.492
But golden fields lie out before me

01:44:09.583 --> 01:44:17.460
Where weary eyes no more will weep

01:44:17.549 --> 01:44:25.130
I'm goin' home to see my father

01:44:25.224 --> 01:44:32.555
I'm goin' home no more to roam

01:44:32.648 --> 01:44:40.560
I am just goin' over Jordan

01:44:40.656 --> 01:44:50.407
I am just goin'... over home...

01:44:53.085 --> 01:44:56.454
Merry Christmas, Pangle,

Merry Christmas, darlin',

01:45:05.305 --> 01:45:08.425
We won't,
- It's dangerous, Don't sleep here.

01:45:08.517 --> 01:45:12.680
Oh, it's bitter, They
could stop one night.

01:45:12.771 --> 01:45:15.345
They stop one night,
they're gonna wanna stop two.

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:17.813
I'll be all right, This coat's warm.

01:45:17.901 --> 01:45:20.688
What about next Sunday?
Lt'll be New Year,

01:45:20.779 --> 01:45:23.899
Maybe,
- Gonna be a better one than 1864,

01:45:23.991 --> 01:45:27.940
This war's over in a month,
- That's what he said a month ago.

01:45:28.036 --> 01:45:30.610
It started off bein' over in a month.

01:45:30.706 --> 01:45:33.327
Night, Miss Sally, Merry Christmas,

01:45:33.417 --> 01:45:36.168
Night, Miss Ruby,

01:45:38.797 --> 01:45:41.253
You're stayin' with us tonight, Sally,

01:45:41.341 --> 01:45:44.046
That's my Ruby,
- She's an original,

01:45:47.097 --> 01:45:52.471
What kind of name's Georgia?
- It's where he's from, It's not his name.

01:45:52.561 --> 01:45:57.768
Well, I know it's meant to be the
ugliest state under the heavens.

01:45:57.858 --> 01:46:00.775
Why do you care what his name is?

01:46:01.653 --> 01:46:04.903
Hey, what do you call that
cluster of stars right there?

01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:07.066
Right there.

01:46:07.159 --> 01:46:09.828
Uh,,, There? That's Orion.

01:46:09.912 --> 01:46:15.154
And that's Gemini, and
that is Orion's big dog.

01:46:15.250 --> 01:46:17.243
Canis Major.

01:46:17.336 --> 01:46:19.494
Listen to her, Sal.

01:46:19.588 --> 01:46:22.838
She's turned into a
regular highland girl.

01:46:22.925 --> 01:46:28.548
Nah, I could always name the stars,
Ruby, That was never my problem.

01:46:32.017 --> 01:46:34.093
I love you, darlin',

01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:38.140
in case that big old
sky falls on our heads.

01:46:38.232 --> 01:46:39.560
Aw,,.

01:46:42.861 --> 01:46:46.444
And I love you too, Sally, I do.

01:46:49.201 --> 01:46:51.739
Get up.

01:46:51.829 --> 01:46:55.280
Get up. Get out of here,
quick. The Yankees are coming.

01:46:55.374 --> 01:46:57.165
The Yankees, they're here.

01:46:57.251 --> 01:47:01.379
If they find you here,
things'll go bad on all of us,

01:47:01.463 --> 01:47:04.962
I can try and fight 'em,
- No, My baby, Please, no, Just,,.

01:47:05.050 --> 01:47:07.256
Please, just git.

01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:22.854
We're Union army.
We're lookin' for food.

01:47:22.943 --> 01:47:25.481
Come on, open up. We're hungry.

01:47:25.571 --> 01:47:28.192
I got nothin'. I got nothin'.

01:47:30.659 --> 01:47:35.072
There's a baby inside, Get it,
- Please, he's sick, Don't hurt him, please.

01:47:35.164 --> 01:47:36.539
Please, I got nothin'.

01:47:39.293 --> 01:47:43.753
That's right, Take the chickens,
Take the chickens, They're all I got.

01:47:46.925 --> 01:47:48.965
Says she's only got chickens.

01:47:49.052 --> 01:47:52.587
You lyin' Southern trash.

01:47:53.265 --> 01:47:55.341
We're hungry.

01:47:55.434 --> 01:47:56.809
We got all day.

01:47:57.811 --> 01:48:00.765
See, those birds won't
get you through the winter.

01:48:00.856 --> 01:48:02.480
Please cover up my boy.

01:48:02.566 --> 01:48:05.271
Just tell us where the
food is, we'll pick him up.

01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:07.982
Please, my baby's sick.

01:48:08.071 --> 01:48:10.147
Please, just cover him up.

01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:13.692
Please, I'm beggin' you.

01:48:13.785 --> 01:48:16.573
Please. Have mercy.

01:48:18.665 --> 01:48:21.417
I got a hog.

01:48:21.502 --> 01:48:22.830
I got a hog.

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:26.123
He's hid out behind the house.
- Take a look.

01:48:27.841 --> 01:48:30.712
Please.

01:48:32.179 --> 01:48:34.717
Please, sir, Please.

01:48:34.807 --> 01:48:36.846
He's just a baby.

01:48:38.477 --> 01:48:41.015
He's shaking.

01:48:41.104 --> 01:48:43.678
Please, just cover him up.

01:48:43.774 --> 01:48:48.317
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?

01:48:49.947 --> 01:48:52.901
I ain't got nothin' else, I swear,

01:48:52.991 --> 01:48:55.945
That ain't necessarily so,
- Yes.

01:48:56.036 --> 01:48:58.788
Take me inside, We'll
do whatever you want.

01:48:58.872 --> 01:49:03.534
Take my baby inside, Let's
all go inside. Please.

01:49:03.627 --> 01:49:06.498
Please. Please.

01:49:06.588 --> 01:49:09.755
You take that hog.
I'm as good as dead.

01:49:09.842 --> 01:49:13.127
Take that hog 'cause
I'm as good as dead.

01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:15.378
Shut up.

01:49:20.519 --> 01:49:22.761
No. Agh.

01:49:29.194 --> 01:49:32.528
You know, he's gettin' ready to take a fit,
- What do you care?

01:49:47.045 --> 01:49:49.583
Shh,,, Shh,,.

01:49:49.673 --> 01:49:52.129
That's better, Shh, That's better.

01:49:55.846 --> 01:49:58.551
Hey, come on, Leave
some for the rest of us.

01:50:09.485 --> 01:50:11.892
Move away from the baby.

01:50:13.655 --> 01:50:15.814
Towards me.

01:50:15.908 --> 01:50:19.277
Don't shoot, We just wanted food.

01:50:19.369 --> 01:50:21.658
Take off your boots.

01:50:23.332 --> 01:50:26.701
Take off your pants,
Take off your shirt.

01:50:34.009 --> 01:50:36.085
Don't shoot me, please.

01:50:37.721 --> 01:50:41.007
We're starvin', We
haven't eaten in days,

01:50:41.099 --> 01:50:45.643
Come on,
- We're starving, We haven't eaten in days.

01:50:45.729 --> 01:50:47.805
Come on.

01:50:50.609 --> 01:50:53.147
Thanks, Thank you,

01:50:53.237 --> 01:50:55.562
Now you get runnin',
- I will,

01:50:55.656 --> 01:50:57.862
And keep runnin',
- Thank you,

01:51:58.427 --> 01:52:03.219
I love the snow,
- I hate the snow, I hate the cold,

01:52:04.850 --> 01:52:07.970
Come on.
- Fellas, what's the rush?

01:52:08.061 --> 01:52:12.558
If Ruby finds out we've spent the
night, there'll be hell to pay,

01:52:49.186 --> 01:52:52.353
'My love, where are you?

01:52:53.148 --> 01:52:56.766
'With no hope of reaching
you, I write to you,

01:52:56.860 --> 01:52:59.019
'as I always do,

01:53:00.781 --> 01:53:03.402
as I have always done.'

01:53:10.582 --> 01:53:14.960
I'm alone, but I don't worry...

01:53:15.045 --> 01:53:19.624
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

01:53:23.929 --> 01:53:26.846
You reckon we could eat this?

01:53:27.599 --> 01:53:29.141
Hey.

01:53:29.226 --> 01:53:33.140
Well, you know, you cook somethin'
long enough, you can eat anything.

01:53:33.230 --> 01:53:36.266
It's froze, How long
it been there for?

01:53:36.358 --> 01:53:39.145
You hungry?
- Yeah.

01:53:39.236 --> 01:53:41.312
Not very long.

01:54:18.108 --> 01:54:19.982
Good evenin'.

01:54:20.068 --> 01:54:22.820
Hope we didn't disturb you.

01:54:22.905 --> 01:54:27.068
D'you mind if I warm
myself by your fire?

01:54:27.868 --> 01:54:29.492
Name's Teague,

01:54:29.578 --> 01:54:32.247
Do I know you?
- Stobrod Thewes,

01:54:33.457 --> 01:54:35.615
That your wife?
- That's a 'he,'

01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:37.452
Is 'he' your wife?

01:54:37.544 --> 01:54:42.123
We're musicians, He picks
a banjo, I got a fiddle.

01:54:42.216 --> 01:54:45.585
Your sweetheart's got a
nice piece of flesh on him,

01:54:45.677 --> 01:54:49.093
He looks pretty romantic by the fire,
- It's a picture of love.

01:54:55.729 --> 01:54:58.101
You gonna play that fiddle?

01:54:58.190 --> 01:54:59.850
Sure.

01:54:59.942 --> 01:55:01.899
Sure.

01:55:01.985 --> 01:55:04.061
Hey, wake up.

01:55:05.614 --> 01:55:07.654
Evenin', missis,

01:55:08.283 --> 01:55:10.953
Where's Georgia?
- 'Where's Georgia'?

01:55:15.415 --> 01:55:18.784
Captain Teague wants us to play now,
- Love to.

01:55:18.877 --> 01:55:22.709
We heard there were some deserters up
in these parts hidden out in a big cave,

01:55:22.798 --> 01:55:25.633
Not come to my ears,
- So you don't know where this big cave is?

01:55:25.717 --> 01:55:27.710
No, sir,
- You do, Stobs, He means,,.

01:55:27.803 --> 01:55:29.083
No, right, No, no.

01:55:29.179 --> 01:55:33.094
There is a cave right up near Bearpen
Branch, We played some music up there,

01:55:33.183 --> 01:55:37.762
Never occurred to me they were outliers,
- It ain't nowhere near Bearpen Branch.

01:55:37.855 --> 01:55:39.728
He's always gettin' lost.

01:55:39.815 --> 01:55:42.567
That cave
- we live there.

01:55:42.651 --> 01:55:46.980
I used to freeze up in that cave
till I got gived this new coat.

01:55:47.072 --> 01:55:51.022
Ruby made me this
coat, I like my coat.

01:55:51.118 --> 01:55:54.653
This part belonged to a reverend
and this part belonged to a horse.

01:55:54.746 --> 01:55:59.373
Ruby said - what is it? - I
should pray or neigh, dependin'.

01:55:59.459 --> 01:56:01.701
He don't,,, he don't
know what he's sayin'.

01:56:01.795 --> 01:56:05.663
He got a mind no bigger
than a pickled walnut.

01:56:05.757 --> 01:56:08.593
It's a good coat.

01:56:11.054 --> 01:56:18.433
I wish, I wish my baby was born

01:56:19.688 --> 01:56:26.984
And sittin' on its papa's knee

01:56:27.070 --> 01:56:29.110
And me, poor girl

01:56:29.198 --> 01:56:34.440
And me, poor girl, were dead and gone

01:56:35.871 --> 01:56:43.914
And the green grass
growin' o'er my feet

01:56:44.671 --> 01:56:51.919
I ain't ahead, nor never will be

01:56:53.472 --> 01:57:01.218
Till the sweet apple
grows on a sour apple tree

01:57:02.523 --> 01:57:06.935
The owl, the owl

01:57:07.027 --> 01:57:09.696
Is a lonely bird

01:57:11.448 --> 01:57:14.947
It chills my heart

01:57:15.744 --> 01:57:19.030
With dread and terror

01:57:20.165 --> 01:57:22.787
That someone's blood

01:57:22.876 --> 01:57:24.620
Someone's blood

01:57:24.711 --> 01:57:27.796
There on his wing

01:57:29.007 --> 01:57:32.590
That someone's blood

01:57:33.345 --> 01:57:37.177
There on his... feather

01:57:45.190 --> 01:57:47.064
Broke my young heart.

01:57:51.613 --> 01:57:53.606
We gonna be here all night?

01:57:56.285 --> 01:57:58.361
Stand over there.

01:58:09.423 --> 01:58:12.958
Ruby, she don't know one end
of the war from the other.

01:58:13.051 --> 01:58:16.088
You don't have to worry yourself
about her, is what I'm sayin'.

01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:19.513
Or Ada, neither, You
know what I'm sayin'?

01:58:20.142 --> 01:58:22.763
You too, You stand over there.

01:58:25.898 --> 01:58:28.223
We gonna get our tintype made?

01:58:34.907 --> 01:58:36.733
Don't smile,

01:58:36.825 --> 01:58:38.403
What?
- Quit smilin'.

01:58:38.494 --> 01:58:40.901
He always smiles, He
don't mean nothin' by it.

01:58:40.996 --> 01:58:43.569
I told him, there ain't nothin'
in this world worth a smile.

01:58:43.665 --> 01:58:46.203
Put your hat over your face.

01:58:53.008 --> 01:58:55.048
Cover your face with your hat,

01:59:03.852 --> 01:59:05.679
Ruby.
- What?

01:59:06.438 --> 01:59:07.932
Ruby.
- What's wrong?

01:59:08.023 --> 01:59:11.474
Teague,,, The Home Guard,,,
- What?

01:59:12.569 --> 01:59:14.645
They shot your daddy.

01:59:14.738 --> 01:59:16.861
They shot your daddy, and Pangle too.

01:59:22.871 --> 01:59:27.118
I told Georgia he can stop here, I
told him he can sleep in the barn.

01:59:27.209 --> 01:59:31.041
He's got nothin' inside him, He'll
walk out of here and die in the snow.

01:59:31.129 --> 01:59:34.333
He can milk the cows, I
was worried about that.

01:59:36.718 --> 01:59:40.633
It's five hours' climb
from here, He drew a map.

01:59:40.722 --> 01:59:42.715
I'm ready.

01:59:43.642 --> 01:59:47.556
You know them fools stayed
the night in the mill?

01:59:47.646 --> 01:59:51.726
That's Stobrod Thewes, Can't do one
good thing without addin' the bad.

01:59:51.817 --> 01:59:56.278
Left tracks in the snow all the
way up for the Home Guard to follow,

01:59:56.363 --> 01:59:58.688
Sign that says 'Shoot me,'
- Ruby,,.

02:00:02.035 --> 02:00:03.578
Ruby.

02:00:05.873 --> 02:00:07.912
I'm sorry.

02:00:09.918 --> 02:00:12.705
Every piece of this is man's bullshit.

02:00:12.796 --> 02:00:15.418
They call this war a
cloud over the land,

02:00:15.507 --> 02:00:20.335
but they made the weather, and then they
stand in the rain and say 'Shit, it's rainin'.'

02:00:26.185 --> 02:00:31.392
If I cry one tear for my daddy,
I stole it off a crocodile.

02:00:35.068 --> 02:00:36.148
All right, then.

02:01:25.744 --> 02:01:27.784
All right, then.

02:01:28.831 --> 02:01:31.831
Dear God.

02:01:35.963 --> 02:01:38.121
Oh, dear God.

02:01:44.388 --> 02:01:46.843
He ain't here.

02:01:46.932 --> 02:01:50.799
Agh. Teague's probably took him.

02:01:50.894 --> 02:01:54.762
They did that with the
Swanger boys, didn't they?

02:01:54.857 --> 02:01:57.893
Strung 'em up, as a warnin'.

02:02:03.115 --> 02:02:05.357
They took his coat.

02:02:05.450 --> 02:02:07.324
Why would they take his coat?

02:02:12.916 --> 02:02:16.083
Daddy? Daddy.

02:02:16.170 --> 02:02:18.127
Daddy.

02:02:24.136 --> 02:02:25.334
Daddy?

02:02:25.429 --> 02:02:28.002
He's still breathin'.

02:02:28.098 --> 02:02:30.720
It's Ruby.

02:02:30.809 --> 02:02:32.553
Don't you die on me again.

02:02:38.650 --> 02:02:42.862
We gotta get him home,
- He won't make it, He'll die first.

02:02:42.946 --> 02:02:46.362
He's got hardly no blood left in him.

02:02:49.161 --> 02:02:51.070
There it is, I feel it,

02:02:51.163 --> 02:02:52.242
You got it?
- Yep.

02:02:53.123 --> 02:02:57.584
There's a place close. Old
Cherokee, it used to be.

02:02:57.669 --> 02:03:00.160
It's got shelter, water.

02:03:00.255 --> 02:03:02.877
I used to hide up there
when he'd get a temper goin'.

02:03:02.966 --> 02:03:04.923
God.

02:03:12.267 --> 02:03:16.395
I'll go look for some food,
- Take the shotgun.

02:03:42.339 --> 02:03:43.999
Goddamn.

02:03:54.810 --> 02:03:56.886
Turn around.

02:03:58.397 --> 02:04:01.018
Go back where you came from.

02:04:02.568 --> 02:04:04.940
Go back.

02:04:08.407 --> 02:04:10.483
Ada?

02:04:11.243 --> 02:04:12.406
Ada Monroe?

02:04:14.371 --> 02:04:17.158
Turn around or I'll shoot.

02:04:45.652 --> 02:04:47.147
Inman?

02:04:47.237 --> 02:04:49.313
Inman?

02:05:02.503 --> 02:05:04.709
Inman.

02:05:36.829 --> 02:05:39.117
You better come with me.

02:05:51.468 --> 02:05:53.544
Ruby.

02:05:54.471 --> 02:05:56.049
This is Inman.

02:06:01.228 --> 02:06:03.600
Oh. Congratulations.

02:06:03.689 --> 02:06:07.224
Oughta send you out with
a shotgun a lot more.

02:06:08.986 --> 02:06:12.152
Looks if he's about to topple over,

02:06:12.239 --> 02:06:14.860
I may need to,
- You shot or somethin'?

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:18.446
Not lately,

02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:33.007
He's asleep,
- I ain't surprised,

02:06:33.093 --> 02:06:37.257
Your man looked tuckered out,
- I saw him.

02:06:37.347 --> 02:06:41.760
In Sally Swanger's well, A man
like a black smudge in the snow,

02:06:41.852 --> 02:06:44.888
Well, there you go,
- It wasn't the same, what I saw.

02:06:44.980 --> 02:06:47.186
In the well it was
as if he were falling,

02:06:47.274 --> 02:06:50.939
You probably just don't remember it right,
- I remember it exactly.

02:06:51.028 --> 02:06:53.234
There were crows - black crows.

02:06:53.322 --> 02:06:55.445
They were flyin' towards me.

02:06:55.532 --> 02:06:58.984
Ruby, I thought I was seein' him fall.

02:07:01.246 --> 02:07:04.331
Instead, I was seein'
him come back to me.

02:07:06.835 --> 02:07:10.169
I got big plans for that farm.

02:07:14.176 --> 02:07:16.881
I know.

02:07:16.970 --> 02:07:18.762
I know you have.

02:07:18.847 --> 02:07:22.762
I got a vision in my mind
of how Black Cove oughta be.

02:07:26.897 --> 02:07:29.186
I don't know, Ruby.

02:07:29.274 --> 02:07:33.568
All this while I've been
packin' ice around my heart.

02:07:36.114 --> 02:07:38.950
How do I make it melt?

02:07:41.912 --> 02:07:43.371
Hey.

02:07:44.456 --> 02:07:47.291
You about done with my knife?

02:07:47.376 --> 02:07:50.081
We got a bird to cook.

02:07:50.170 --> 02:07:51.962
Just about.

02:07:54.883 --> 02:07:58.667
You're makin' a pig's ear of that job.

02:08:00.139 --> 02:08:02.215
Give it to me.

02:08:08.063 --> 02:08:10.850
Oh, I ain't gonna cut you.

02:08:12.526 --> 02:08:16.737
Can't see that it'd make a
bit of difference if I did.

02:08:27.541 --> 02:08:29.747
You got the right feelings for her?

02:08:29.835 --> 02:08:33.085
Don't turn your head. Tsk.

02:08:36.842 --> 02:08:38.170
I do.

02:09:03.744 --> 02:09:07.279
I'm sorry, I was tryin' to be quiet.

02:09:12.961 --> 02:09:15.333
Did you get my letters?

02:09:17.007 --> 02:09:19.165
I got three letters.

02:09:19.968 --> 02:09:24.761
I carried them, I carried
them in the book you gave me.

02:09:24.848 --> 02:09:26.307
The Bartram.

02:09:27.476 --> 02:09:30.892
I probably sent 103.

02:09:35.567 --> 02:09:38.141
Did you write to me?

02:09:38.237 --> 02:09:40.146
Whenever I could.

02:09:40.239 --> 02:09:42.445
If you never got
them, I can summarize,

02:09:42.533 --> 02:09:45.368
No, No, no,
- 'I pray you are well,

02:09:45.452 --> 02:09:47.741
'I pray I am in your thoughts.

02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:53.072
You are all that keeps me from
slidin' into some dark place,'

02:09:53.168 --> 02:09:56.253
How did I keep you?

02:09:56.338 --> 02:09:59.209
We barely knew each other,
It was a few moments.

02:09:59.299 --> 02:10:01.209
A thousand moments.

02:10:04.012 --> 02:10:07.678
They're like a bag,,
, of tiny diamonds.

02:10:09.101 --> 02:10:12.719
Don't matter if they're
real or things I made up.

02:10:14.898 --> 02:10:17.105
The shape of your neck.

02:10:18.986 --> 02:10:21.441
That's real.

02:10:21.530 --> 02:10:25.658
The way you felt under my
hands when I pulled you to me.

02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:39.625
You were ploughing a field.

02:10:40.591 --> 02:10:43.129
You were carrying a tray,

02:10:43.218 --> 02:10:46.005
You wouldn't come in,
- No, I wouldn't go in.

02:10:46.096 --> 02:10:51.007
So that's why I had to carry a
tray, So I could come out to see you.

02:10:53.103 --> 02:10:56.187
That kiss.

02:10:56.273 --> 02:10:59.891
Which I kissed every
day of my walking.

02:11:01.612 --> 02:11:03.735
Every day I was waiting.

02:11:04.615 --> 02:11:06.025
Longing.

02:11:06.116 --> 02:11:09.200
Longing to see your face.

02:11:15.417 --> 02:11:18.667
If you could see my inside,,.

02:11:18.754 --> 02:11:23.748
Now, whatever you wanna name it
- my spirit? That's what I fear.

02:11:24.801 --> 02:11:26.759
I think I'm ruined.

02:11:26.845 --> 02:11:30.345
They kept tryin' to
put me in the ground,

02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:34.269
But I wasn't ready,
- Inman,,.

02:11:34.353 --> 02:11:37.769
But if I had,,, if I
had goodness, I lost it.

02:11:39.983 --> 02:11:43.233
If I had anything tender
in me, I shot it dead.

02:11:44.905 --> 02:11:48.772
How could I write to
you after what I done,

02:11:49.743 --> 02:11:50.822
what I seen?

02:11:50.911 --> 02:11:52.405
Number one,

02:11:52.496 --> 02:11:54.821
shut this door, It's freezin'.

02:11:54.915 --> 02:11:57.916
Number two, shut that
door, It's freezin'.

02:11:58.001 --> 02:12:00.457
Layin' on my back, my
fingers poked in my ears,

02:12:00.546 --> 02:12:03.250
tryin' to shut out who's
got a bag of diamonds,

02:12:03.340 --> 02:12:05.629
who's carrying a tray,,.

02:12:05.717 --> 02:12:08.090
If you wanna get three
feet up a bull's ass,

02:12:08.178 --> 02:12:11.713
just listen to what sweethearts
whisper to one another.

02:12:11.807 --> 02:12:17.477
In fact, if y'all gonna wimble-wimble
all night, I'm gonna sleep in with him,

02:12:32.286 --> 02:12:35.121
I'll say good night,
- No.

02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:40.576
Please,,,

02:12:41.587 --> 02:12:43.247
don't say good night.

02:13:08.071 --> 02:13:10.859
Wars make some things pointless.

02:13:15.037 --> 02:13:17.409
It's hard to imagine a wedding.

02:13:19.625 --> 02:13:22.994
I think even my father
would recognize that.

02:13:23.670 --> 02:13:25.746
Ada, I wanna marry you.

02:13:27.466 --> 02:13:29.708
If you'll have me.

02:13:30.469 --> 02:13:35.345
Isn't there some religion where you just
have to say 'I marry you' three times,

02:13:35.432 --> 02:13:37.425
and you're man and wife?

02:13:38.393 --> 02:13:40.433
I marry you.

02:13:41.522 --> 02:13:43.728
I marry you, I marry you.

02:13:48.821 --> 02:13:50.860
Why is that funny?

02:13:50.948 --> 02:13:55.574
I think it's 'I divorce you' three
times and you're not married anymore.

02:13:57.579 --> 02:13:58.990
I can wait for you.

02:13:59.623 --> 02:14:05.044
Oh, Inman, I marry you,
I marry you, I marry you.

02:14:05.128 --> 02:14:07.121
I marry you, I marry you.

02:14:14.972 --> 02:14:18.720
I have so,,, I have
so many buttons, Sorry.

02:14:22.437 --> 02:14:25.225
Will you turn your back?

02:14:36.451 --> 02:14:37.827
No.

02:14:40.122 --> 02:14:42.411
No, I will not.

02:16:27.521 --> 02:16:30.438
I'll lead the horse at a
pace your daddy can tolerate,

02:16:30.524 --> 02:16:34.189
You two go ahead now,
- No, I don't wanna do that,

02:16:34.278 --> 02:16:37.029
No, We can all go together,
- It's safer this way.

02:16:37.114 --> 02:16:39.439
We're deserters, No one
has a quarrel with you.

02:16:39.532 --> 02:16:41.691
He's right.

02:16:41.785 --> 02:16:45.735
I gather I,,, I need
permission from you, Ruby,

02:16:45.831 --> 02:16:49.164
if I reckon on livin' at Black Cove.

02:16:58.343 --> 02:16:59.968
All right, then.

02:17:03.932 --> 02:17:06.008
You stay on that horse.

02:17:06.101 --> 02:17:09.138
And don't lose it, Or sell it.

02:17:09.938 --> 02:17:12.808
Gonna need it back on the farm.

02:17:15.777 --> 02:17:17.853
All right, Daddy.

02:17:21.992 --> 02:17:24.565
I don't wanna let you go.

02:17:27.371 --> 02:17:29.780
I'll be with you by nightfall.

02:17:35.464 --> 02:17:36.839
Ugh.

02:17:38.799 --> 02:17:40.877
All right, then.

02:18:11.708 --> 02:18:15.540
Hope that Georgia boy's
been tendin' to the animals,

02:18:15.629 --> 02:18:18.500
I knew you were thinkin' on him,
- I was not.

02:18:18.590 --> 02:18:20.998
I was thinkin' on swollen udders,
- Oh,,,.

02:18:21.093 --> 02:18:25.340
And before you say 'same difference',,,
- I'm sayin' nothin'.

02:18:25.430 --> 02:18:29.891
Miss Lovey-Dovey.
Miss Lovey-Dovey.

02:18:29.977 --> 02:18:32.016
Hey.

02:18:32.103 --> 02:18:36.232
That was a long funeral for your daddy,
- That was a wake.

02:18:36.316 --> 02:18:37.941
That was Irish.

02:18:39.986 --> 02:18:41.896
Now, your friend Georgia here,,.

02:18:41.989 --> 02:18:45.607
We went down to visit you when we
heard you were harbourin' deserters,

02:18:45.700 --> 02:18:49.829
and he told us - after some
persuasion - you were up here.

02:18:49.913 --> 02:18:52.784
We were up and down this mountain.

02:18:52.875 --> 02:18:54.665
Up and down.

02:18:54.751 --> 02:18:56.577
There will be a reckoning.

02:18:56.670 --> 02:18:59.706
When this war is over,
there will be a reckoning.

02:19:01.424 --> 02:19:03.501
Did you make this coat?

02:19:03.593 --> 02:19:05.585
Helpin' a deserter
- that's treason.

02:19:05.679 --> 02:19:10.258
Now, I know it's half
horse and half reverend.

02:19:11.894 --> 02:19:13.851
A reckonin'?

02:19:15.439 --> 02:19:18.938
The reckoning's for your world.

02:19:19.026 --> 02:19:21.647
It's not mine.

02:19:25.031 --> 02:19:28.448
I'll'llbe damned, He's
a hard bastard to kill,

02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:33.325
No.
- Ruby.

02:19:40.172 --> 02:19:41.714
Inman.

02:19:55.395 --> 02:19:57.222
Captain Teague.

02:20:39.356 --> 02:20:43.306
Come down from there.
- No, sir, Here is fine.

02:20:43.402 --> 02:20:46.356
I'll just shoot the
horse out from under you,

02:20:46.446 --> 02:20:49.613
You ridin' Captain Teague's animal?
- I am,

02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:52.820
He dead?
- I hope so.

02:20:52.911 --> 02:20:57.289
Look, give me your gun and ride on
home, I'm done fightin', I'm sick of it.

02:20:57.374 --> 02:20:59.947
I give you my gun, you're
gonna shoot me dead.

02:21:00.043 --> 02:21:02.499
I will not shoot you, but nor
am I goin' down this mountain...

02:21:02.588 --> 02:21:04.746
lookin' over my shoulder for you.

02:21:04.840 --> 02:21:07.129
That's what they call a conundrum,

02:21:11.638 --> 02:21:15.636
I'll tell you what I got on my side,
- What you got on your side?

02:21:22.566 --> 02:21:24.274
The confidence of youth.

02:21:39.666 --> 02:21:41.825
Inman.

02:22:33.178 --> 02:22:35.254
No.

02:23:10.924 --> 02:23:12.122
I,,,

02:23:13.177 --> 02:23:15.668
came,,, back.

02:23:24.563 --> 02:23:26.639
I love you.

02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:02.347
Baby.

02:24:28.085 --> 02:24:32.830
What we have lost will
never be returned to us.

02:24:32.923 --> 02:24:36.007
The land will not heal.

02:24:36.093 --> 02:24:39.047
Too much blood.

02:24:39.138 --> 02:24:42.838
The heart will not heal.

02:24:42.933 --> 02:24:46.634
All we can do is make
peace with the past...

02:24:46.728 --> 02:24:49.184
and try to learn from it.

02:24:52.317 --> 02:24:56.647
What are you doing?
- He died in the night, love.

02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:59.899
Bring him here,

02:24:59.992 --> 02:25:03.158
Don't kill him,
- I'm not gonna kill him.

02:25:03.245 --> 02:25:07.195
We have to try somethin'
or else he's gonna die too.

02:25:07.291 --> 02:25:09.414
It's all right.

02:25:10.878 --> 02:25:13.748
We're gonna try a little trick.

02:25:13.839 --> 02:25:16.294
Shh.

02:25:35.402 --> 02:25:39.649
There are days now when I
manage not to think of you.

02:25:40.908 --> 02:25:46.068
When the needs of the farm call
with more urgency than my heart.

02:25:47.748 --> 02:25:51.746
This time of year there's
so much life everywhere.

02:25:53.629 --> 02:25:56.250
I find you in all of it.

02:25:57.716 --> 02:26:01.334
As if you were still
walking home to me.

02:26:03.764 --> 02:26:07.844
If you could see us now this
Easter day at Black Cove,

02:26:07.935 --> 02:26:11.517
you would know every step
of your journey was worth it.

02:26:11.605 --> 02:26:15.306
I'm still climbing upwards

02:26:15.400 --> 02:26:18.686
And my journey's almost ended

02:26:18.779 --> 02:26:22.112
So, friend, if you're thirsty

02:26:22.199 --> 02:26:25.698
Climb this mountain with me

02:26:28.831 --> 02:26:32.200
Grace Inman, nobody said 'Eat,'

02:26:45.013 --> 02:26:49.759
For good friends,
good food, good family,

02:26:49.852 --> 02:26:52.852
all our blessings, O
Lord, we thank thee,

02:26:52.938 --> 02:26:54.397
Amen,
- Amen,

02:26:54.481 --> 02:26:56.141
Amen,
- Amen.

02:26:56.233 --> 02:26:58.771
Amen.

02:26:58.861 --> 02:27:02.561
Sweetheart, there's no cider,
- That's for you.

02:27:02.656 --> 02:27:07.152
Right, I'd best,,, I'd best
fetch it, I got my orders.

02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:13.864
I looked once more down Sally's well,

02:27:13.959 --> 02:27:17.577
and this time there was
nothin' there to haunt me.

02:27:19.047 --> 02:27:21.005
Just clouds.

02:27:21.091 --> 02:27:25.468
Clouds, and then... sun.

02:29:32.473 --> 02:29:38.012
Well I recall his parting words

02:29:38.103 --> 02:29:42.979
Must I accept his fate

02:29:43.066 --> 02:29:48.772
Or take myself far from this place?

02:29:48.864 --> 02:29:54.534
I thought I heard a black bell toll

02:29:54.620 --> 02:29:59.246
A little bird did sing

02:29:59.333 --> 02:30:02.037
Man has no choice

02:30:02.127 --> 02:30:06.456
When he wants every thing

02:30:08.550 --> 02:30:14.221
We'll rise above the scarlet tide

02:30:14.306 --> 02:30:20.012
That trickles down
through the mountain

02:30:20.103 --> 02:30:27.649
And separates the widow from the bride

02:30:35.244 --> 02:30:40.867
Man goes beyond his own decision

02:30:40.958 --> 02:30:46.581
Gets caught up in the mechanism

02:30:46.672 --> 02:30:52.342
Of swindlers who act like kings

02:30:52.427 --> 02:30:58.264
And brokers who break everything

02:30:58.350 --> 02:31:04.020
The dark of night was swiftly fading

02:31:04.106 --> 02:31:05.897
Close to the dawn of day

02:31:08.944 --> 02:31:15.148
Why would I want him
just to lose him again?

02:31:17.578 --> 02:31:23.248
We'll rise above the scarlet tide

02:31:23.333 --> 02:31:29.039
That trickles down
through the mountain

02:31:29.131 --> 02:31:36.462
And separates the widow from the bride

02:31:56.742 --> 02:32:02.578
You'll walk unscathed
through musket fire

02:32:03.916 --> 02:32:09.835
No ploughman's blade
will cut thee down

02:32:11.298 --> 02:32:17.467
No cutler's horn will mark thy face

02:32:17.554 --> 02:32:23.924
And you will be my ain true love

02:32:24.019 --> 02:32:29.939
And you will be my ain true love

02:32:32.528 --> 02:32:38.400
And as you walk through
death's dark veil

02:32:39.535 --> 02:32:44.909
The cannon's thunder can't prevail

02:32:46.208 --> 02:32:51.831
And those who hunt thee down will fail

02:32:52.673 --> 02:32:58.545
And you will be my ain true love

02:32:59.555 --> 02:33:05.593
And you will be my ain true love

02:33:08.021 --> 02:33:14.190
Asleep inside the cannon's mouth

02:33:15.154 --> 02:33:20.859
The captain cries
'Here comes the rout'

02:33:21.785 --> 02:33:27.740
They'll seek to find
me north and south

02:33:27.833 --> 02:33:34.085
I've gone to find my ain true love

02:33:36.425 --> 02:33:42.926
The field is cut and bleeds to red

02:33:43.015 --> 02:33:48.768
The cannonballs fly round my head

02:33:49.688 --> 02:33:56.141
The infirmary man may count me dead

02:33:56.236 --> 02:34:02.488
When I've gone to
find my ain true love

02:34:03.285 --> 02:34:05.954
I've gone to find my ain true love

02:34:06.305 --> 02:34:12.252
