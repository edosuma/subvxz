00:12.078 --> 00:13.745
- The thing that was so cool

00:13.780 --> 00:15.947
about sister Rosa Parks' attitude

00:15.982 --> 00:18.416
wasn't that she refused to
give her seat to a white man,

00:18.451 --> 00:20.719
but it's what motivated her to do so.

00:20.754 --> 00:21.886
Can you hear me?

00:21.921 --> 00:23.054
Can you hear me?

00:23.089 --> 00:26.057
What led a 42-year-old, black seamstress

00:26.092 --> 00:28.159
to rebel against the establishment?

00:28.194 --> 00:31.463
That's what we must find out.

00:37.904 --> 00:41.573
¶ Nobody, do like Rosa ¶

00:48.048 --> 00:49.948
- You fucking piece of shit nigger!

00:49.983 --> 00:52.651
We gonna feed you to Edelweiss.

00:52.686 --> 00:56.121
Motherfucker, we'll teach
you to spread propaganda

00:56.156 --> 00:59.124
all over the neighborhood.

00:59.159 --> 01:00.592
My name's Will,

01:00.627 --> 01:02.127
and as far as I can remember,

01:02.162 --> 01:04.995
I've always dreamt of having a Afro.

01:05.031 --> 01:07.198
See, it's the symbol of my individuality.

01:07.233 --> 01:10.302
The symbol of all the struggles
against the oppressor.

01:13.139 --> 01:16.875
¶ I'm gonna cross the river ¶

01:19.245 --> 01:21.813
- A good nigger is a dead nigger.

01:21.848 --> 01:24.282
You hear me, motherfucker?

01:24.317 --> 01:26.284
- Some people call it a bush,

01:26.319 --> 01:27.986
I just call it "love,"

01:28.021 --> 01:32.657
and I plan to spread
that love to everybody.

01:53.480 --> 01:57.082
¶ I wanna give you my love

01:57.117 --> 02:00.585
¶ I wanna tell you love

02:00.620 --> 02:02.587
¶ I gotta tell you

02:02.622 --> 02:04.255
¶ I gotta do you

02:04.290 --> 02:05.490
¶ Please let me hear

02:05.525 --> 02:07.092
¶ It from you

02:07.127 --> 02:09.026
¶ And I'll be

02:09.062 --> 02:10.595
¶ Your slave

02:10.630 --> 02:13.098
¶ Baby

02:49.135 --> 02:51.436
- Brothers, we must
forget where we come from

02:51.471 --> 02:53.304
and how the way to get here was.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.273
And nowadays,
more than yesterday,

02:55.308 --> 02:57.575
we must join together,
to make this a better world,

02:57.610 --> 02:59.711
a world where everyone
has his place.

02:59.746 --> 03:02.714
Come on out for Afros
and cupcakes and Lord,

03:02.749 --> 03:04.716
come and experience
the incredible story

03:04.751 --> 03:07.786
of our incredible seamstress,
sister Rosa Parks.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.621
Sister Parks who was
goin' against everyone.

03:09.656 --> 03:12.056
¶ Jesus time

03:12.091 --> 03:17.896
- Refusing, refusing to give up
her seat on that bus...

03:17.931 --> 03:21.499
- Woody, Woody, Woody,
Woody, turn it down.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.835
- But Muh, Muh, Marvin--

03:23.870 --> 03:27.405
- There's no Muh, Muh,
Muh, Marvin, just shut up,

03:27.440 --> 03:30.308
you're making my ears bleed.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.910
- Damn it, Will.

03:31.945 --> 03:34.179
Are you done already?

03:34.214 --> 03:37.282
- I love you too, Marvin.

03:37.317 --> 03:38.850
- That's Marvin,

03:38.885 --> 03:40.652
known as Marv the Scissors.

03:40.687 --> 03:43.121
He the barber from
across the street.

03:43.156 --> 03:44.656
His shop ain't always crowded,

03:44.691 --> 03:47.492
so he playin'
dominoes all the time.

03:47.527 --> 03:49.794
And the guys he's sitting
with are his brothers,

03:49.829 --> 03:51.329
Hathi the Big Ears, you know,

03:51.364 --> 03:53.164
because he got big ears.

03:53.199 --> 03:56.000
And Kahn the Anaconda.

03:56.035 --> 03:59.137
Don't ask.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.139
The brother with
the mop in the back,

04:01.174 --> 04:02.507
that's Woody.

04:02.542 --> 04:05.043
He spends most of his time
sweeping Marvin's shop

04:05.078 --> 04:06.377
and singing opera.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.213
He stutters when he speaks,

04:08.248 --> 04:11.216
but never when he sings.
-

04:13.219 --> 04:15.153
That's Algiers Point,

04:15.188 --> 04:18.223
one of the quietest
places in New Orleans.

04:30.303 --> 04:31.636
You dirty nigger,

04:31.671 --> 04:34.138
This is our first
and last warning.

04:34.173 --> 04:35.840
If you goin' to live,

04:35.875 --> 04:38.676
shut down your propaganda
salon immediately,

04:38.711 --> 04:40.812
KKK.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.213
- KKK?

04:42.248 --> 04:44.850
This has gotta be a joke.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.253
The portrait gallery
wouldn't be complete

04:48.288 --> 04:50.889
if I didn't tell you about Nola.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.390
When Woody introduced her to me,

04:52.425 --> 04:54.392
it was love at first sight.

04:54.427 --> 04:55.927
But her brother
is a bit jealous,

04:55.962 --> 04:58.830
so I try to keep that affair
confidential, you know?

04:58.865 --> 05:01.466
Under wraps.

05:02.502 --> 05:03.668
- What are you doing here?

05:03.703 --> 05:05.871
- Moving in.

05:07.674 --> 05:11.276
Are you happy to see me?

05:11.311 --> 05:12.443
- What about Denzel?

05:12.478 --> 05:14.913
- Denzel,
Nola's half brother,

05:14.948 --> 05:16.347
well they had different daddies

05:16.382 --> 05:18.016
and as incredible
as it might seem,

05:18.051 --> 05:21.185
he is as dark as ebony
and she's white as snow.

05:21.220 --> 05:25.423
- No! You have to
talk to my brother.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.958
- Look, I told you, baby,
I'm gonna talk to him

05:26.993 --> 05:29.060
but you know how Denzel is.

05:29.095 --> 05:31.095
Er, ah sister, you know?

05:31.130 --> 05:33.464
Look, why you think I made
up that pizza boy story?

05:33.499 --> 05:34.666
- You seen my sister?

05:34.701 --> 05:36.401
- Oh, no, no, man but you
need to keep a eye out

05:36.436 --> 05:37.802
on it if you want it to turn
out all right, you know?

05:37.837 --> 05:39.237
- What's that supposed to mean?

05:39.272 --> 05:40.438
- I saw her hanging
out with one of those

05:40.473 --> 05:42.373
pizza delivery boys again.

05:42.408 --> 05:43.408
- Which one?

05:45.145 --> 05:46.277
- His biggest fear
is that someone
will lay a hand on his sister.

05:46.312 --> 05:48.413
- Put yourself in my
shoes, though, I mean,

05:48.448 --> 05:50.448
your brother Denzel
is a little bit

05:50.483 --> 05:51.716
- And ever since
he's been suspecting her

05:51.751 --> 05:53.251
of working as that bunny

05:53.286 --> 05:55.653
to pay them tap
dance classes off,

05:55.688 --> 05:57.255
he's been a bit nervous.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.290
- Touch my sister and
I'll fucking kill you,

05:59.325 --> 06:00.959
piece of shit, I'll
rip out your guts

06:00.994 --> 06:02.427
and I'll put 'em on the--

06:02.462 --> 06:04.229
- I said he looked like him.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.499
Just gimme some more
time, all right?

06:08.534 --> 06:11.336
- That's why I hired
her as my shampoo girl.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.171
She was seeking
any ways and means

06:13.206 --> 06:16.407
of escaping her
brother's vigilance.

06:16.442 --> 06:18.576
Denzel isn't really a bad guy,

06:18.611 --> 06:20.812
but now whenever he
hears anything about

06:20.847 --> 06:23.781
pizza delivery boys,

06:23.816 --> 06:26.184
he goes bonkers, ya heard me?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.619
He just can't help it.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.254
- The fuck?

06:33.893 --> 06:35.593
- If I asked you in here today,

06:35.628 --> 06:37.962
it's not to help me
pick out the color

06:37.997 --> 06:40.198
of a fucking pepperoni.

06:43.369 --> 06:45.303
It's to tell you

06:45.338 --> 06:48.373
that I think you're all a
buncha heap of fuckin' linguini

06:48.408 --> 06:53.478
and your fuckin' brains are
made outta marinara sauce.

06:53.513 --> 06:56.347
Why can't you find this
one fucking moolie.

06:56.382 --> 06:58.149
- Cause it's a big fuckin' city.

06:58.184 --> 06:59.317
This fuckin' guy
could be anywhere.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.352
- I don't give a
fuck, you hear me?

07:01.387 --> 07:02.987
I want you to check
every fuckin' pit,

07:03.022 --> 07:05.356
every dive bar in
this fuckin' city.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.525
I want that fuckin' baboon!

07:07.560 --> 07:08.559
Huh?

07:08.594 --> 07:12.196
Gonna hang him in a tree
by his fuckin' balls.

07:12.231 --> 07:15.366
- Hey, Geuse.

07:15.401 --> 07:18.302
Why don't you just
cool it off?

07:18.337 --> 07:20.038
- Cool it off.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.507
He wants me to cool it off.

07:22.542 --> 07:24.375
It's cool off you
cunt-faced faggot.

07:24.410 --> 07:25.843
You don't even remember
the motherfucker

07:25.878 --> 07:27.512
that fucked you up
and you want me to

07:27.547 --> 07:29.313
cuh cuh cuh cuh cool it off?

07:29.348 --> 07:32.183
- Brief amnesia and the
doctors say that i should--

07:32.218 --> 07:34.085
- Fuck the doctor!

07:34.120 --> 07:35.319
Let me tell you somethin'.

07:35.354 --> 07:36.654
I'll cool it off
when that fuckin' ape

07:36.689 --> 07:40.525
goes back to his fuckin'
savannah in fuckin' apeville

07:40.560 --> 07:43.161
and his fuckin' ape family
friends rip him apart

07:43.196 --> 07:45.263
like a buncha fuckin' hyenas.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.531
- And you ain't doing
yourself any good

07:46.566 --> 07:47.899
by gettin' this
fuckin' pissed off.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.534
- I thought you said you
saw him the other day.

07:49.569 --> 07:51.903
- I think I saw him
over in Jackson Square.

07:51.938 --> 07:54.338
It's fucking Jackson Square,
I lost him.

07:54.373 --> 07:57.241
- Oh, you lo--
Say that again,
I'm sorry, you did what?

07:57.276 --> 07:58.276
- I lost him.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.344
- You lost him?

08:00.379 --> 08:03.414
He's not a fucking !-tip,
he's got white fuckin' hair.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.016
Hey, hey, hey everybody.

08:05.051 --> 08:06.217
How many of you have ever
seen a fucking nigger

08:06.252 --> 08:07.385
with white hair before, hm?

08:07.420 --> 08:08.619
Raise your hand.

08:08.654 --> 08:09.921
Hm, anybody?

08:09.956 --> 08:11.422
You better put your
fuckin' hand down.

08:11.457 --> 08:13.992
Put your fuckin' hand down.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.730
- The fuck you want me to do?

08:18.765 --> 08:19.731
I lost him.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.200
He just disa-fuckin'-peared.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.802
- Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

08:24.837 --> 08:28.439
And fuck you and your
faggoty fuckin' face, fuck.

08:28.474 --> 08:30.308
You know what this fucking
guy has done to me?

08:30.343 --> 08:31.542
Look at me!

08:31.577 --> 08:35.480
¶ A high life

08:35.515 --> 08:37.381
¶ Wherever I look

08:37.416 --> 08:40.217
¶ It's only green lights ¶

08:41.754 --> 08:43.087
- Hey, what?

08:44.924 --> 08:46.791
- He grabbed me by
my fuckin' hair.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.392
My hair.

08:48.427 --> 08:51.429
Then he put me in my
fucking door of my

08:51.464 --> 08:53.364
Cadillac!

08:59.505 --> 09:00.838
- That's what happens
when you lay a hand

09:00.873 --> 09:02.740
on my sister, you
fuckin' macaroni.

09:02.775 --> 09:04.108
- That's what he says to me.

09:04.143 --> 09:05.610
Huh?

09:05.645 --> 09:07.411
Oh, but my nightmare
isn't fuckin' over yet.

09:07.446 --> 09:09.580
No, no not by a
fuckin' long shot.

09:09.615 --> 09:11.349
Amanda comes out, she sees me,

09:11.384 --> 09:14.519
she's convinced that
my ass was kicked
by some jealous husband

09:14.554 --> 09:15.853
who's wife I'm bangin'.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.656
- Gonge, Guesuippe.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.692
Oh,puta fugada.

09:21.427 --> 09:24.229
- Yeah, that's my reality
right fuckin' now, okay?

09:25.698 --> 09:27.498
She doesn't even
say goodbye to me,

09:27.533 --> 09:29.267
she just fuckin' is hammering me

09:29.302 --> 09:32.537
over and over and over again
with her fuckin' purse.

09:36.676 --> 09:37.642
- Fuck you!

09:37.677 --> 09:39.677
- So you know what she does?

09:39.712 --> 09:40.945
She takes my fucking kids.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.647
My kids.

09:42.682 --> 09:44.682
Back to Sicily.

09:44.717 --> 09:46.217
You know what that means?

09:46.252 --> 09:47.885
That means I'm gonna start
getting some fucking questions.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.221
I want you to cue the
Godfather music right now.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.222
Hm?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.557
This is some serious shit.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.858
I love you!

09:53.893 --> 09:55.493
So I want you to find
that fuckin' baboon

09:55.528 --> 09:58.563
and I want you to find
him right fuckin' now.

10:01.467 --> 10:03.168
Yes?

10:04.237 --> 10:06.270
- What if we just

10:06.305 --> 10:08.072
call Enzo?

10:08.107 --> 10:09.473
- What?

10:09.508 --> 10:10.675
Oh, no no no.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.543
Hey boss, we don't
need this fuckinrajol,

10:12.578 --> 10:13.744
I could fuckin' do this.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.514
- No no no no,
that's a good idea.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.516
Yeah, retard face,
that's a good idea.

10:18.551 --> 10:19.817
I want you to call Enzo

10:19.852 --> 10:21.619
and I want you to tell
him we'll offer him

10:22.154 --> 10:23.488
25K.

10:25.157 --> 10:26.624
- 25?

10:26.659 --> 10:29.393
Why don't you keep your
fuckin' mouth shut.

10:54.921 --> 10:55.887
- Pronto.

10:55.922 --> 10:58.089
- Hey, ciao, Enzo.

10:59.725 --> 11:00.925
Giuseppe needs to find a guy

11:00.960 --> 11:02.560
and he wants you
to take care of it.

11:02.595 --> 11:03.861
- Marcello, you know
how much I hate

11:03.896 --> 11:06.264
to leave the villa
once I'm here.

11:06.299 --> 11:09.133
- Giuseppe's got 25,000 reasons
you might wanna reconsider

11:09.168 --> 11:10.334
leaving your villa.

11:10.369 --> 11:14.272
- Damn it, Violeta, move the
fan, you're blocking my sun.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.806
25 grand, huh?

11:15.841 --> 11:17.275
What's the weather
like over there?

11:17.310 --> 11:18.977
- The weather?

11:20.746 --> 11:22.546
Benissimo.

11:22.581 --> 11:24.215
Oh, yeah, hot and
sunny next couple days.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.783
- You know what,
I'll tell you what.

11:25.818 --> 11:28.452
You tell Giuseppe
just because it's him,

11:28.487 --> 11:30.087
I'm gonna come all
the way over there.

11:30.122 --> 11:31.956
- Good.

11:31.991 --> 11:34.692
- Ciao, see you soon.
- Good.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.671
- All right, baby, okay,

11:46.706 --> 11:47.972
you know you're gonna
be here for a few hours

11:48.007 --> 11:49.473
it's untangling all these
things but your bush gonna be--

11:49.508 --> 11:51.676
- Hey, Will, I just seen
another one of those pizza guys,

11:51.711 --> 11:52.743
have you seen my sister yet?

11:52.778 --> 11:54.779
- Damn, Denzel, no man,
I ain't seen her,

11:54.814 --> 11:57.014
she's off today,
you want a cupcake?

11:57.049 --> 11:59.050
- Fuck them cupcakes.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.753
- I swear, they gonna be
poisoning all the pizzas.

12:02.788 --> 12:04.555
- All right.
-  - Know what you want, I know what you want.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.123
You're not gonna let Marvin
do your hair anymore?

12:06.158 --> 12:07.358
- That perv's place?

12:07.393 --> 12:08.960
No, thank you.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.495
Last time I was there
he grabbed my ass.

12:11.530 --> 12:12.997
- Say what?
- I swear.

12:13.032 --> 12:16.834
Benny, get your finger
out your nose, right now.

12:16.869 --> 12:20.304
So I warned him,
next time he does that,

12:20.339 --> 12:22.506
I'm telling Karen,
straight away.

12:22.541 --> 12:23.975
- Marvin's not a bad guy.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.276
- Are you kidding?

12:25.311 --> 12:27.445
- I've been knowing him
since he was a child.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.513
He's very sensitive,
I can tell you.

12:29.548 --> 12:30.848
- Sens--? Pfft.

12:30.883 --> 12:33.551
- Cheri, why do you have
to interpret everything?

12:33.586 --> 12:37.455
All I know is,
Marvin is a pervert.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.690
Believe me
- Hello.

12:39.725 --> 12:43.728
Benny, finger, nose, out.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.364
No one had ever thought of
putting Afros together

12:46.399 --> 12:49.834
with civil rights in town,
and the place got so poppin'

12:49.869 --> 12:52.837
that even white folks'd come
here to get their hair done.

12:52.872 --> 12:55.206
And the best thing about it all,
the thing that makes

12:55.241 --> 12:57.074
every barber in town jealous,

12:57.109 --> 13:02.113
especially Marvin across the
street is that Erykah Badu

13:02.148 --> 13:05.683
comes to my salon,
every time she's in town.

13:07.753 --> 13:10.888
Lemme tell you, I'd
be jealous, too,

13:10.923 --> 13:13.758
if it wadn't me.

13:26.772 --> 13:31.409
- Karen! Kar!

13:31.444 --> 13:33.277
Karen!

13:34.847 --> 13:35.980
Karen!

13:37.483 --> 13:38.850
Karen!

13:40.453 --> 13:42.720
- The vixen with
the multi-colored nails,

13:42.755 --> 13:46.724
that's Karen, Marvin's
girlfriend, with Nola.

13:46.759 --> 13:50.261
They always together smokin'
and watchin' musicals.

13:50.296 --> 13:53.631
She sells weed and ecstasy,
probably the best in town.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.534
But she has a real knack
for gettin' in trouble.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.036
Whenever a nutcase
shows up in the hood,

13:59.071 --> 14:01.439
you can be sho' he
goin' to Karen's.

14:01.474 --> 14:04.308
- Karen!
Karen!

14:04.343 --> 14:05.943
Karen, Karen!

14:05.978 --> 14:07.144
- What the hell you doing here?

14:07.179 --> 14:10.915
I'm doing my
fucking nails, shit.

14:10.950 --> 14:11.816
Hathi, fuck.

14:11.851 --> 14:12.950
What the hell you doin' here?

14:12.985 --> 14:15.720
Close the damn door.

14:19.492 --> 14:20.825
- I'm out of pills.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.661
- We agreed I was gonna
come to your place tomorrow.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.229
Couldn't this wait 24 hours?

14:25.264 --> 14:26.964
- I know, I know, but
I'm goin' crazy, though.

14:26.999 --> 14:27.898
- That's still no reason for you

14:27.933 --> 14:29.266
to come to my house like this.

14:29.301 --> 14:30.568
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but
I'm fuckin' freaking out.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.103
- Didn't I tell you that
there were some basic

14:32.138 --> 14:33.904
precautions that
we needed to take?

14:33.939 --> 14:35.239
- I know, I know, you did.

14:35.274 --> 14:36.841
- And that's why you
show up at my house

14:36.876 --> 14:40.845
with your balls hanging out
and a fucking wad of cash.

14:44.783 --> 14:46.684
- Look, Karen, I'm sorry,
I'm so fucking sorry, a'ight,

14:47.086 --> 14:49.087
but me and Kahn we
met this girl, right?

14:50.022 --> 14:51.689
And then this bitch just
swallowed all the pills.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.991
- No!

14:54.026 --> 14:55.593
- Karen, Karen,

14:55.628 --> 14:57.962
Karen, Karen, please,
come back, Karen, please.

14:57.997 --> 14:59.697
Please, Karen, please.

14:59.732 --> 15:00.865
Come on, Karen,
don't leave me like this

15:00.900 --> 15:03.568
with my balls hangin' out,
come on now.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.638
- Hey, Woody.

15:07.673 --> 15:09.173
- Vinny!

15:09.208 --> 15:10.341
- What's up, baby?

15:10.376 --> 15:12.109
- Ya, ya, ya feeling better?

15:12.144 --> 15:14.745
- Uh, yeah, I fuh,
fuh, feel great.

15:15.781 --> 15:18.149
And look, I got new watches.

15:18.184 --> 15:19.783
And I can give 'em to you at

15:19.818 --> 15:22.753
retail price,

15:23.789 --> 15:25.723
40 bucks.
- 40?

15:25.758 --> 15:28.125
Well, 20.

15:28.160 --> 15:32.029
- Luh, listen, listen,
Woody, these watches

15:32.064 --> 15:33.964
they're coming
straight from Italy

15:33.999 --> 15:36.700
and they're, they're
real good replica

15:36.735 --> 15:40.304
so, uh, 35?

15:40.339 --> 15:42.907
- Bring them down to 25

15:42.942 --> 15:44.842
and I'll take three.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.143
- You're gonna kill my business,

15:46.178 --> 15:49.747
come on man, look,
look, look, look, Snoop.

15:49.782 --> 15:50.581
- Snoop?

15:50.616 --> 15:52.983
- Snoop Doggy Dog-Dogg.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.985
He wears that watch.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.887
It's a good watch.
- Nice.

15:56.922 --> 15:58.923
- So it's
three for a hundred

15:58.958 --> 16:02.059
and, ow,

16:02.094 --> 16:05.529
I'll throw in three pairs
of the colored drawers

16:05.564 --> 16:07.498
that your brothers love so much.

16:08.434 --> 16:10.734
- I'll take it.

16:10.769 --> 16:12.002
- Yeah, yeah you will.

16:12.037 --> 16:13.103
- I want this one.
- Okay.

16:28.387 --> 16:30.655
- Here, put this on.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.471
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey Karen, hey Karen.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.040
I like this right here,
this is new right?

16:50.075 --> 16:51.542
Do you have some
blush on, you look--

16:51.577 --> 16:53.611
- Don't bother, Kahn, OK?

16:53.646 --> 16:56.080
- OK, so let me--
- No, stop

16:56.115 --> 16:57.548
your bullshit.

16:57.583 --> 17:00.751
Tell me, do you see
a sign on my door?

17:01.987 --> 17:03.654
- Uh, no, no there's no sign.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.989
- How 'bout on the street?

17:05.023 --> 17:07.625
Do you see a poster
sayin', "Big annual fair

17:07.660 --> 17:10.461
"for fucked up nurses and
niggers wearin' silly drawers

17:10.496 --> 17:14.064
"or with big balls
bouncing around."

17:14.098 --> 17:15.165
- No.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.968
- And, do you know why?
- Why?

17:18.002 --> 17:21.171
- Because I'd have the narcs
on my back in a second.

17:21.205 --> 17:24.340
- OK, OK, you don't have to
get so fucked up about it.

17:24.376 --> 17:27.344
I mean, I kinda like
the colored drawers.

17:27.378 --> 17:29.013
I mean, uhh.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.848
- I'm not talking about
your fucking jocks, Khan.

17:30.883 --> 17:34.818
I don't give a shit if they
are green, purple, or leopard.

17:34.853 --> 17:37.588
It wouldn't make a
fucking difference!

17:37.623 --> 17:40.524
You can never,
ever, ever come here

17:40.559 --> 17:41.792
do you hear me?
- OK, OK, OK,

17:41.827 --> 17:44.028
you don't have to get
so mad, all right?

17:44.063 --> 17:46.797
It was Hathi the
one that brought the
bitch to me, I didn't,

17:46.832 --> 17:48.599
Hathi was the one,
Hathi the one that did it.

17:48.634 --> 17:52.169
- No, stop, I am
sick of your shit!

17:52.204 --> 17:53.671
Jesus, give me strength.

17:53.706 --> 17:54.505
- You see what you did?

17:57.776 --> 17:59.076
What you gonna be pissed off
at me for?

17:59.445 --> 18:00.944
You let the motherfucker
take the last pill!

18:04.483 --> 18:06.717
- Shh.

18:22.901 --> 18:25.002
- Hey, turn around, put this on.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.037
- Damn.
- Damn.

18:27.072 --> 18:29.006
- And listen to me,
the two of you.

18:29.041 --> 18:32.743
I am willing to help you
out this one last time,

18:33.145 --> 18:35.979
but you can never
come here again.
Am I making myself clear?

18:36.014 --> 18:38.482
- Yes, yes, yes.

18:40.085 --> 18:43.554
- Be careful with these pills,
I cut them with ketamine.

18:43.589 --> 18:44.955
Get the hell out of here, now!

18:45.324 --> 18:47.658
- OK.
- Wait, wait.

18:47.693 --> 18:49.893
Are you forgetting something?

18:49.928 --> 18:51.362
- Oh, thank you.

18:51.397 --> 18:52.262
- We love you.
- No.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.932
Are you fucking stupid or what?

18:56.268 --> 18:58.736
Get this bitch out of here
before I chuck her in the trash.

18:58.771 --> 19:02.139
- Yeah, yeah.
Hey honey, time to wake up.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.011
- Fucking cockheads.

19:08.614 --> 19:09.947
- C'mon, time to go, yes, yes.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.850
- It was very nice to meet you.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.952
- Yes it was, ha ha ha.

19:32.704 --> 19:35.272
- You know, sometimes I think
I should just give it up.

19:35.307 --> 19:38.308
- I think we should
do one big hit, Karen,

19:38.343 --> 19:41.979
and then no more pot and
pills, and for me,

19:42.014 --> 19:43.647
no more Denzel.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.449
- What do you have in mind?

19:45.484 --> 19:46.917
- A kidnapping.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.152
- A what?

19:48.187 --> 19:50.254
- Yeah, in a few days, there'll
be a wedding anniversary

19:50.289 --> 19:51.889
of Elios Andreopoulus.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.157
- Who the hell is that?

19:53.192 --> 19:55.092
- Elios Andreopoulus,
the Greek shipping mogul.

19:55.127 --> 19:56.393
Bitch, don't you
read the papers?

19:56.428 --> 19:58.095
- No, I don't read
the fucking papers.

19:58.130 --> 20:01.131
- Well there will be
industrial bigwigs,

20:01.166 --> 20:03.067
heads of showbiz and the like.

20:09.241 --> 20:11.341
- What are you
trying to say, Nola?

20:11.376 --> 20:13.944
- Karen, what do I do to
pay for my dance classes?

20:13.979 --> 20:15.646
- Strip.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.781
- I'm a birthday bunny, Karen,

20:17.816 --> 20:21.118
so we'll get hired
as birthday bunnies,

20:21.153 --> 20:23.720
and when the right time comes,

20:23.755 --> 20:25.255
hands on your head, don't move,

20:25.290 --> 20:27.191
or I'll blow your brains out.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.293
Hands on your head, don't move.

20:29.328 --> 20:32.029
- Don't move or I will
fucking shoot you.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.865
- Oh my goodness.
- Follow me and everything's
gonna be all right.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.300
- It will work, why?

20:36.335 --> 20:39.036
Mr. Andreopoulus is
crazy about his wife,

20:39.071 --> 20:40.370
he'll do whatever we ask.

20:40.405 --> 20:43.140
Second, we have the surprise
element working for us,

20:43.175 --> 20:46.810
if we act fast, we'll be
long gone before they notice.

20:46.845 --> 20:48.111
So?

20:54.086 --> 20:58.055
- I think your ass is just
as nuts as Hathi and Kahn.

21:01.793 --> 21:04.161
- Woo, Woody, thank
you very much.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.363
- Well, welcome.

21:06.398 --> 21:08.565
- Bye.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.334
- Hey, what's up, man.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.135
Hey, you doin' all right?

21:12.170 --> 21:13.303
- Yeah, I'm doin' fine.

21:13.338 --> 21:15.239
- You sure?
- Yeah.

21:15.274 --> 21:19.009
- All right man, don't spit
in my pizzas, now.

21:19.044 --> 21:19.843
Whazzup, Woody?

21:19.878 --> 21:23.080
- Will, how are you?

21:23.115 --> 21:24.181
- What are you
hungry or something?

21:24.216 --> 21:26.183
I got some cupcakes over there,
fresh-baked baby.

21:26.218 --> 21:29.186
- I can't, Marvin

21:29.221 --> 21:31.355
punished me.

21:31.390 --> 21:32.322
- What's this about?

21:32.357 --> 21:35.025
- I touched his album,

21:35.060 --> 21:37.594
so I gotta stay and sweep.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.062
- Naked babes album?

21:39.097 --> 21:40.264
- Yeah.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.365
- With the--
- With the

21:41.400 --> 21:44.168
bodacious b-booty-licious.

21:44.836 --> 21:46.737
- Yeah, man, but that
don't make any sense,

21:46.772 --> 21:48.705
you can't stay out here all day.

21:48.740 --> 21:51.408
- Gotta stay.

21:51.443 --> 21:53.343
- All right, well I can still
count on you on Friday, right?

21:53.378 --> 21:56.380
- Oh, would, wouldn't
miss it for the world.

21:56.415 --> 21:57.748
- All right, all right,
all right.

21:57.783 --> 21:59.116
I'm telling you, Woody,
this is gonna be

21:59.151 --> 22:01.218
my most beautiful sermon ever,

22:01.253 --> 22:03.420
I'm telling you, baby,
you gonna be there, all right?

22:03.455 --> 22:05.289
- Yeah.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.891
- Ha ha, yeah, all right, Wood.

22:07.926 --> 22:10.394
- See you later.

22:32.651 --> 22:34.885
- It's 10:00 in the morning,
I can't believe this,

22:34.920 --> 22:37.054
and you're already stoned.

22:37.089 --> 22:40.424
- Hey, baby,
don't worry about me.

22:40.459 --> 22:41.592
Pot doesn't do
a thing to me.

22:41.627 --> 22:43.427
Oh, where are we going?

22:43.462 --> 22:45.095
Chill out.

22:58.443 --> 23:01.244
- Dookie don't give me the cash.
- Yes, are you open?

23:01.279 --> 23:02.846
- Yes, sir, yes we are sir.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.282
Please come right in,
have a seat.

23:05.317 --> 23:07.017
Yeah, you can sit
right here, sir.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.285
- All right, sir.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.287
- What you doin', Karen?

23:10.322 --> 23:13.624
You gonna burn my balls.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.926
- Here.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.160
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?

23:17.195 --> 23:18.428
Get out of here.

23:18.463 --> 23:19.796
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I can be useful.

23:19.831 --> 23:21.632
- No, no, no, no, move away.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.834
- I got the clippers,
let me help out.

23:23.869 --> 23:25.335
- I don't need your help,
get out of here.

23:25.370 --> 23:29.339
Sir, if you don't mind just
excuse us for one second, OK?

23:29.374 --> 23:30.374
Be right back.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.942
Get over here.

23:33.645 --> 23:35.112
What the fuck are
you doing, huh?

23:35.147 --> 23:36.713
I saw him first,
he's my customer.

23:36.748 --> 23:37.814
- I know, I know.
- All right, so

23:37.849 --> 23:39.149
what the fuck are you doing?

23:39.184 --> 23:40.317
Do I bother you when
you have a customer?

23:40.352 --> 23:42.152
No, exactly,
no, no, no, exactly.

23:44.122 --> 23:45.522
Let it go.

23:45.557 --> 23:47.558
- Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Step over there.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.060
All right, sir, how you doing,

23:50.095 --> 23:51.228
all right?
- Not good, sir.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.496
- Trippin'.

24:00.572 --> 24:02.673
- Oh, oh, oh.

24:02.708 --> 24:05.809
- You cum fast, you know that?
-  - Oh sweet Jesus.

24:05.844 --> 24:07.845
Oh, thank you.

24:09.247 --> 24:10.981
Thank you, baby.

24:11.016 --> 24:12.650
God damn.

24:15.353 --> 24:18.255
Hey, Will, what brings
you 'round these parts?

24:18.290 --> 24:19.556
- You ain't gonna
believe this one, Marvin,

24:19.591 --> 24:22.192
guess who came by
the salon yesterday?

24:22.227 --> 24:23.427
- A woman?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.796
- Oh, the most beautiful
girl of all, Marvin.

24:27.165 --> 24:28.298
- You're shittin' me, right?

24:29.534 --> 24:33.103
- Nuh uh, she even wrote a few
words on this photo for you.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.438
Oh shit, no wait.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.739
- Gimme that!

24:35.774 --> 24:37.374
- No, no, Marvin, I'm
gonna give it to ya,

24:37.409 --> 24:38.575
just chill out, I'm just
gonna take it in you know,

24:38.610 --> 24:39.509
the curves and everything,
the beautiful--

24:39.544 --> 24:42.512
- Gimme that, I said, damn.

24:42.547 --> 24:45.348
I'll put this in my album.

24:45.383 --> 24:48.418
Sweet Jesus, she almost nekkid.

24:48.453 --> 24:51.688
- What, oh, oh?

24:51.723 --> 24:54.524
- Oh, that's nice.

24:54.559 --> 24:58.395
- To Marvin, with
burning thoughts,

24:58.430 --> 25:02.199
Miss Erykah "Fat Belly" Badu.

25:05.637 --> 25:07.304
She is bold.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.606
- Oh, oh, oh, you ain't
seen nothin' yet, Marvin,

25:09.641 --> 25:11.675
turn it over, look at the back.

25:13.145 --> 25:13.844
- Oh.

25:16.648 --> 25:18.215
- What is that?

25:18.250 --> 25:20.317
- Well, I told her about
your special album, you know,

25:20.352 --> 25:22.953
and she thought it was
kinda weird at first, but,

25:22.988 --> 25:24.655
she went for it.

25:27.259 --> 25:30.560
- You mean to say, this here

25:30.595 --> 25:32.496
is pussy hair?

25:32.531 --> 25:35.699
- Oh, not just from
any pussy, Marvin.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.405
- Oh,

25:42.440 --> 25:44.407
shit,

25:44.442 --> 25:45.609
pussy.

25:52.117 --> 25:53.917
- What the hell is
going on in here?

25:53.952 --> 25:55.185
- Get a
towel or something, man!

25:55.220 --> 25:56.686
- What is this shit?

25:56.721 --> 25:59.055
- It's from Marvin's
nekkid babes album.
- What?

25:59.090 --> 26:00.557
Yeah, she just cut
her hair for him.

26:01.092 --> 26:02.692
- What? What album?

26:02.727 --> 26:05.596
What the hell are
you talking about?

26:15.307 --> 26:17.541
Nasty motherfucker!

26:17.576 --> 26:21.411
You asshole!

26:22.714 --> 26:24.514
- Coffee, Marse.

26:24.549 --> 26:26.950
- Oh, nice.

26:26.985 --> 26:28.618
Don't touch it.

26:28.653 --> 26:31.421
Salut.
- Salut.

26:34.459 --> 26:35.759
- Oh,

26:37.095 --> 26:39.563
Enzo, fuckin' beautiful.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.498
- Fuck off, Marcello,
the weather's shit,

26:41.533 --> 26:44.301
and I'm in a bad fuckin' mood.

26:44.336 --> 26:45.569
- It's just a little rain.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.637
- A little rain,
my ass, all right,

26:46.972 --> 26:48.305
don't try to bullshit me,
all right,

26:48.340 --> 26:51.642
three more days they'll
have to build a fuckin' ark.

26:53.078 --> 26:55.679
All right, go get my bags,
pay the cabbie,

26:55.714 --> 26:58.248
then go get me a tanning lamp,
and I mean a good one, huh?

26:58.283 --> 27:02.018
I'm starting to
feel pale, already.

27:02.053 --> 27:03.753
- All right, all right.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.755
- All right,
where the fuck's Giuseppe?

27:05.790 --> 27:07.591
- He's in the kitchen,
he's waitin' for ya.

27:09.661 --> 27:11.361
- Bye, guys.

27:11.396 --> 27:13.029
- Ciao, Sabrina.

27:13.064 --> 27:15.132
- Hey, how,

27:16.468 --> 27:18.001
how are you?

27:18.036 --> 27:19.169
- Good.

27:19.204 --> 27:22.506
- Listen, have ya, ya, you
thought at all about, um...

27:26.011 --> 27:28.778
Did you have a chance to think

27:28.813 --> 27:31.681
about dinner?

27:31.716 --> 27:35.719
- You know
the conditions, Vinny.

27:41.126 --> 27:42.893
- Do you mind?

27:42.928 --> 27:44.628
Do you mind?

27:44.663 --> 27:48.231
Forget about the girl,
go pay the cab,

27:48.266 --> 27:52.435
get the fucking bags, and
let's do some fucking work.

27:52.470 --> 27:54.404
Capiche?

27:58.677 --> 28:02.612
- Fucking liar,
son of a bitch, fuck you!

28:02.647 --> 28:04.214
Your brother is
a fucking toilet,

28:04.249 --> 28:06.483
and he just needs someone
to flush all that shit away.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.051
What are you doing
with a fucking broom?

28:08.086 --> 28:09.986
Let's go, get in.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.789
- Did you
let him explain it?

28:12.824 --> 28:14.391
- Explain?

28:14.426 --> 28:16.726
The only worthy explanation
is that the motherfucker

28:16.761 --> 28:18.762
is really fucking insane.

28:18.797 --> 28:21.932
He thinks pussy,
he dreams pussy,

28:21.967 --> 28:24.000
he needs pussy.

28:24.035 --> 28:25.669
Pussy, pussy,
pussy, pussy, pussy.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.737
He won't get away with
it because I am done

28:27.772 --> 28:30.507
with his motherfucking ass,
you hear that, Woody?

28:30.542 --> 28:35.078
You can tell your bastard
brother, we are fucking done!

28:35.113 --> 28:37.480
Fuck, Woody, are you OK?

28:37.515 --> 28:41.685
- I don't feel so good.

28:41.720 --> 28:45.689
- Woody, you get this each
time we go to an audition.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.792
- I'm afraid

28:48.827 --> 28:51.127
you've become very
disillusioned.

28:51.162 --> 28:52.162
- What are you trying to say?

28:56.601 --> 28:58.601
- All right, let me make
sure I understand the goal.

28:58.636 --> 29:01.204
You want me to find this black
motherfucker with white hair?

29:01.239 --> 29:05.642
- No, no, the goal is to find
him before Amanda comes back.

29:05.677 --> 29:07.644
I'm on thin fucking
ice here, Enzo.

29:07.679 --> 29:09.313
You know how Sicilian women are.

29:09.948 --> 29:11.081
She's convinced that some

29:11.116 --> 29:13.016
jealous husband beat
me over the head,

29:13.051 --> 29:15.619
and she's given me 72
hours to sort it out,

29:17.756 --> 29:19.522
or she's
gonna divorce me.

29:19.557 --> 29:21.992
- Get the fuck out, divorce?
- Yeah, yeah.

29:22.027 --> 29:25.195
But, no, no because I
have you, you're the best.

29:25.230 --> 29:26.529
Huh? Right?

29:26.564 --> 29:28.698
You're gonna find
that motherfucker.

29:28.733 --> 29:30.500
- Giuseppe, it's raining
cats and dogs out there,

29:30.535 --> 29:32.168
and look, I got arthritis.

29:32.203 --> 29:35.572
- OK, I'm gonna give
you an extra two thous--

29:37.242 --> 29:39.809
Five thous--

29:39.844 --> 29:41.711
$10,000?

29:41.746 --> 29:43.747
Fine 10,000, you're
gonna do me like that?

29:44.149 --> 29:46.349
Come on, this is my
marriage on the line.

29:46.384 --> 29:50.687
- Bottom line, the weather's
shit, I'll do it for 50.

29:50.722 --> 29:53.356
- 50? 50?!

29:53.391 --> 29:56.593
50?

29:56.628 --> 29:57.794
- And,

29:59.597 --> 30:01.698
a tanning lamp.

30:01.733 --> 30:03.900
- I'm here to take
care of you two,

30:03.935 --> 30:07.570
I wanna make sure you
guys are taken care of.

30:07.605 --> 30:11.741
Look, you can get yourself
a plain facial tanner,

30:11.776 --> 30:14.077
or a luxury tanning bed,
but if your friend

30:14.112 --> 30:17.213
is as fussy as you say,

30:17.248 --> 30:20.350
I doubt he'll be happy.

30:20.385 --> 30:23.186
Gentlemen, take a look at this.

30:25.523 --> 30:28.224
Now if you truly want to
indulge, might I suggest

30:28.259 --> 30:29.726
you choose a product

30:29.761 --> 30:33.463
at the cutting
edge of technology.

30:33.498 --> 30:36.733
And that's the exclusive
way to Bronze Biological.

30:36.768 --> 30:38.735
We cultivate the beet

30:38.770 --> 30:41.771
and the sugar cane extract.

30:41.806 --> 30:45.342
That's right, the spray-tanning
Bronze Biologique.

30:49.881 --> 30:53.149
- 50 thousand dol-- Are you
out of your fucking mind?

30:53.184 --> 30:54.951
You could do this in your sleep.

30:54.986 --> 30:57.754
I'm not asking you to go
after the holy fucking grail,

30:57.789 --> 30:59.756
I'm asking you to find
one fucking nigger

30:59.791 --> 31:02.792
that's got white hair, huh?

31:02.827 --> 31:05.762
Find the motherfucker,
boink him over the head,

31:05.797 --> 31:06.930
and bring him back to me.

31:06.965 --> 31:10.100
- It's 50, 50 grand,
you got the motherfucker

31:10.135 --> 31:12.402
by Saturday night.

31:13.838 --> 31:15.906
- You.

31:18.276 --> 31:19.609
Mother.

31:21.546 --> 31:22.479
OK.

31:22.514 --> 31:25.515
25 now, 25 later.

31:26.584 --> 31:31.121
Hey, don't fucking let me down.

31:31.156 --> 31:33.890
Cause I'm fucking
counting on you.

32:12.463 --> 32:14.397
- What are we doing here?

32:14.432 --> 32:16.833
- Now you really thought
I was gonna forget our

32:16.868 --> 32:18.902
anniversary?

32:18.937 --> 32:20.403
Come on now.

32:20.438 --> 32:21.704
Now you love me, or you love me?

32:21.739 --> 32:22.472
- I love you.

32:22.507 --> 32:23.239
Say it into the mic.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.574
- I love you.

32:24.609 --> 32:27.244
She loves me, yes..

32:31.449 --> 32:35.051
Nola's skin smelled
like green papaya,

32:35.086 --> 32:38.188
as the bangs of her hair
fell over her temples,

32:38.223 --> 32:40.990
her cheeks were all pink and
her lips were glowing like

32:41.025 --> 32:44.060
caramel apples.

32:44.095 --> 32:45.061
The rum was so good

32:45.096 --> 32:48.498
I felt like I could
kiss her all night long,

32:48.533 --> 32:50.967
if she hadn't interrupted us,
I really believe

32:51.669 --> 32:53.870
I would have beaten
the world-record

32:53.905 --> 32:58.441
for longest kiss ever.

33:04.015 --> 33:05.815
Ahh.

33:27.138 --> 33:28.972
You can make it,
you can make it,

33:29.007 --> 33:31.474
the door's right there.

33:54.999 --> 33:57.734
- It looks like the
bed is spinning.

33:59.237 --> 34:02.105
- Oh no, that's just
the rum talking.

34:06.344 --> 34:08.011
- Come on.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.847
- Oh, mmm.

34:14.351 --> 34:17.186
I hate these buckles.

34:17.221 --> 34:18.955
They're always so hard.

34:18.989 --> 34:20.590
- I know.

34:23.428 --> 34:25.929
- Don't laugh at me.

34:30.702 --> 34:33.369
- I feel dizzy.

34:33.404 --> 34:36.139
- You should expect that by now.

34:40.545 --> 34:41.978
- Are you staying a bit?

34:42.013 --> 34:43.112
- Nuh uh.
- Uh huh.

34:43.147 --> 34:44.514
- Nuh uh.
- Uh huh.

34:46.217 --> 34:49.652
- Come on, he never comes
back before morning.

34:52.956 --> 34:54.657
- It is morning
- No.

34:54.692 --> 34:57.160
- It is
morning right now.

34:59.664 --> 35:02.098
It's morning, baby, besides...

35:04.135 --> 35:07.103
It'd be better like this.

35:08.473 --> 35:10.306
- You're gonna have
to talk to him, Will.

35:10.341 --> 35:12.642
- Mmhm.

35:23.988 --> 35:25.855
- Good night.

35:30.027 --> 35:32.028
- Good night.

36:27.518 --> 36:29.385
- Son of a bitch!

36:29.420 --> 36:31.988
Asshole, liar.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.123
Fucking dickhead.

36:34.158 --> 36:36.292
- Damn, woman, shit.

36:36.327 --> 36:38.961
- I told you not
to come back here.

36:38.996 --> 36:40.296
- Honey, calm down.

36:40.331 --> 36:43.499
- Stop, Marvin, I don't wanna
hear from your sorry ass.

36:43.534 --> 36:45.501
- Listen, Karen, I mean,

36:45.536 --> 36:48.004
it's nothing more than
just a misunderstanding.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.239
- I warned ya, Marvin,
I told you,

36:50.274 --> 36:54.010
if you ever did that shit again,
we would be over.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.912
- That's just a personal album.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.181
I mean there's no need to
make a big deal out of it.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.183
- You're a fucking psycho.

37:00.218 --> 37:03.352
- Listen, honey, I never
said I was perfect.

37:03.387 --> 37:05.521
But, I'm gettin' help.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.623
Yeah, I'm in therapy.

37:07.658 --> 37:08.825
- Therapy?

37:08.860 --> 37:10.960
- Shh.

37:15.766 --> 37:17.333
Oh, shit!

37:17.368 --> 37:19.302
- You're a fucking perv!

37:24.642 --> 37:27.510
- Listen, Karen,

37:27.545 --> 37:30.313
I don't wanna lose you.

37:30.348 --> 37:34.016
I really don't wanna lose you.

37:34.051 --> 37:36.185
Who'll get me my pills?

37:36.220 --> 37:39.121
I mean, yours are
the best in town.

37:39.156 --> 37:40.456
Oooh, woo woo.

37:40.491 --> 37:43.659
- Oh, so that's what
worries you, huh?

37:43.694 --> 37:45.995
- No, no, no, no, don't, hey,

37:46.030 --> 37:48.364
Karen, Karen.

37:48.399 --> 37:50.300
Fuck, dude.

38:11.155 --> 38:13.189
- Asshole.

38:13.224 --> 38:15.558
Now get the fuck out of here.

38:15.593 --> 38:18.194
- Shit, with the god damn pills?

38:19.830 --> 38:23.199
- You make me sick,
pussy hair collector!

38:23.234 --> 38:24.333
- Fuck you, bitch!

38:24.368 --> 38:26.168
- Out!

38:32.343 --> 38:34.443
Fuck you! Fuck you, bitch!

38:39.383 --> 38:41.017
- Damn, this is a fucking doo.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.252
- Get your ass down
and shut the fuck up.

38:43.287 --> 38:46.422
- Motherfucker!

38:54.332 --> 38:56.632
- Hey, Marse.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.334
- Hey, kid.

39:00.304 --> 39:05.041
- You mind if I ask you
a personal question?

39:05.076 --> 39:05.975
- Yeah, it's all right,
go ahead.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.477
- A little embarrassing, though.

39:08.212 --> 39:09.212
- Go ahead.

39:10.381 --> 39:12.281
- Well you're satisfied

39:12.316 --> 39:16.719
with your, um, pecker size?

39:16.754 --> 39:18.955
- It's a little fucking
personal, don't you think?

39:18.990 --> 39:20.556
- Yeah, if, if, if

39:20.591 --> 39:21.824
if it's an issue for you.

39:21.859 --> 39:24.126
- No, it's not an issue for me,

39:24.161 --> 39:26.362
I just don't feel
comfortable standing here

39:27.398 --> 39:29.765
casually chatting about
my privates with you.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.834
- I understand.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.570
Cause you think it's short?

39:34.605 --> 39:36.072
I mean you can tell me,

39:36.107 --> 39:37.273
you can just say,
"Vinnie, my dick's short."

39:37.308 --> 39:38.941
- Vinnie, fuck off.

39:38.976 --> 39:41.277
Go back to work, we got
things to do, all right.

39:41.312 --> 39:43.946
- You don't have
to be embarrassed,

39:43.981 --> 39:47.483
I mean there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

39:47.518 --> 39:49.952
- Vinny, I'm not embarrassed,
all right.

39:49.987 --> 39:52.688
My dick is neither too short,
or too long.

39:52.723 --> 39:55.658
It's about a standard size,
all right?

39:55.693 --> 39:59.428
Go back to work.

39:59.463 --> 40:02.432
- Um, you were never curious
enough to measure it?

40:03.267 --> 40:04.300
- What are you sick in the head?

40:04.335 --> 40:06.269
Go back to work, now.

40:29.794 --> 40:31.227
- Pronto.

40:31.262 --> 40:34.296
Yeah, Marcello, no,
I'm just gonna take a piss.

40:34.331 --> 40:37.199
Yeah, let me tell you
something, Marcello,

40:37.234 --> 40:39.335
you found this great
machine, I'm telling you,

40:39.370 --> 40:41.671
amazing, I've been on
there five minutes,

40:41.706 --> 40:44.974
I can feel the blood rushing
to my balls as we speak.

40:45.009 --> 40:48.244
Yeah, yeah, look, get that pizza
delivery uniform over here,

40:48.279 --> 40:49.345
give me some fliers,

40:49.380 --> 40:50.546
let's get this show on
the road, all right?

40:50.581 --> 40:51.647
Ciao.

40:51.682 --> 40:53.349
What the fuck are
you doing, what?

40:53.384 --> 40:54.717
You painting the bedroom?

40:54.752 --> 40:56.986
Get your ass in there,
come on, you blonde bimbo.

40:57.021 --> 40:59.488
Move it, move it.

40:59.523 --> 41:01.891
- Mm, got, got the delivery?

41:01.926 --> 41:03.492
- He's in heaven.

41:03.527 --> 41:07.196
- Good, so he's happy.

41:07.231 --> 41:09.498
What about your tongue?

41:09.533 --> 41:11.434
- What about it?

41:11.469 --> 41:15.538
- Well, is, is it rather long,
rather short?

41:15.573 --> 41:17.406
- All right, that's it, Vinny.

41:17.441 --> 41:19.241
What's this about?

41:19.276 --> 41:20.843
What's this about, right now?

41:20.878 --> 41:22.778
- Can I see it?

41:22.813 --> 41:24.280
- See what?
- Your tongue.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.514
- I'm not
sticking my tongue out.

41:25.549 --> 41:26.449
- Show me your tongue.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.416
- Why should I
show you my tongue?

41:27.451 --> 41:29.118
I'm not sticking my tongue out.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.586
- Once, one time.

41:30.621 --> 41:32.388
- This is now
getting embarrassing.

41:32.423 --> 41:33.689
I'm not sticking my tongue out,

41:33.724 --> 41:35.558
much less my, my, my penis.

41:35.593 --> 41:38.561
Jesus Christ, what the
hell is wrong with you,

41:38.596 --> 41:39.628
are you sick in the head?

41:39.663 --> 41:41.464
- Come on, it's me Vinny,
just once.

41:41.499 --> 41:42.965
- I'm not doin' it.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.938
One time, that's it.

41:48.973 --> 41:51.540
And then you stop this
line of questions.

41:51.575 --> 41:52.742
- Swear.

41:58.482 --> 42:01.584
Holy shit, you, you
got a long tongue.

42:01.619 --> 42:03.285
- Fine
- It's a good tongue.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.720
- OK, that's it,
this is getting old, Vinny.

42:04.755 --> 42:06.255
I want to know what
this is about right now.

42:06.290 --> 42:07.656
Right now.

42:07.691 --> 42:11.360
- It's sensitive, um...

42:11.395 --> 42:15.464
OK.
Have ya ever been able

42:15.499 --> 42:17.633
to

42:17.668 --> 42:20.336
touch your penis

42:20.371 --> 42:23.439
wi, with

42:23.474 --> 42:26.275
the tip of your tongue?

42:26.310 --> 42:27.510
- What the fuck?

42:27.545 --> 42:30.412
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

42:30.447 --> 42:33.549
Do I look psycho enough to
you to suck my own, ahhh?

42:34.585 --> 42:37.319
Do I look like a
contortionist to you?

42:37.354 --> 42:41.123
What are you on?

42:41.158 --> 42:42.491
It's about Sabrina.

42:42.526 --> 42:46.362
- If you ever reach your penis
with the tip of your tongue,

42:46.397 --> 42:49.598
Vinny, I'll go to
dinner with you.

42:49.633 --> 42:51.133
- Oh, for--

42:51.168 --> 42:53.369
- And if there's even
slightest chance that I can

42:53.404 --> 42:56.338
make this happen,
even the remotest possibility,

42:56.373 --> 42:58.474
then I gotta do it,
I mean she is hot, man,

42:58.509 --> 43:00.376
and she drives me nuts,

43:00.411 --> 43:02.211
and I've been doin' yoga,

43:02.246 --> 43:04.980
and I've been drinking
only mineral water

43:05.015 --> 43:07.883
and I looked at the blogs online
and I haven't eaten gluten

43:07.918 --> 43:10.452
in over a week,

43:10.487 --> 43:12.955
but I'm still like
half an inch away.

43:17.561 --> 43:20.796
Marse? Marse?

43:24.702 --> 43:25.534
- Shit.

43:25.569 --> 43:27.470
- Can't believe this.

43:33.444 --> 43:36.345
- Oh, shit.

43:48.592 --> 43:52.228
- Marvin, this album on
its own is not necessarily

43:52.263 --> 43:55.364
a sign of an
obsessive pathology.

43:55.399 --> 43:58.234
- You don't understand, Doc,

43:58.269 --> 44:01.403
that's all I think about.

44:01.438 --> 44:05.407
Just women, I'm tellin' ya, Doc,

44:05.442 --> 44:09.545
I'm an obsessive.

44:09.580 --> 44:11.747
As soon as I see one,

44:11.782 --> 44:16.452
I just can't help but
think about stuff.

44:16.487 --> 44:18.053
- OK, well.

44:18.088 --> 44:21.857
Now, you tell me a little
bit about your mother.

44:21.892 --> 44:23.058
- What about her?

44:23.093 --> 44:26.061
- Well, do you love your mother?

44:26.096 --> 44:30.065
- Of course I love my moms,
she's a pious woman

44:30.100 --> 44:33.569
who gave us lots of love,
me and my three brothers.

44:33.604 --> 44:35.404
- When you were young did you,

44:35.439 --> 44:38.341
did you view your mother
in a particular way?

44:42.813 --> 44:44.580
- What you mean, Doc?

44:44.615 --> 44:47.550
- I don't know,
Marvin, you tell me.

44:49.987 --> 44:52.788
- Hey, what you
tryin' to say here, Doc?

44:52.823 --> 44:56.325
You leave her out of
this, you hear me?

44:56.360 --> 45:00.763
- You could be the victim of
an unresolved Oedipal complex.

45:11.342 --> 45:12.808
- Aw man,

45:12.843 --> 45:14.510
I just can't believe

45:14.545 --> 45:17.746
it's over with Karen, you know?

45:17.781 --> 45:19.748
- How do you think she feels?

45:19.783 --> 45:21.784
She found your book.

45:21.819 --> 45:24.486
- Oh, damn it.

45:24.521 --> 45:29.024
- Marvin, some women are very

45:29.059 --> 45:31.493
sensitive and
- Sensitive.

45:31.528 --> 45:34.630
- and very very fragile.
- They fragile.

45:34.665 --> 45:37.400
- Fragile and sensitive.

45:39.803 --> 45:42.738
- I'm gonna kill that bitch.

46:27.651 --> 46:29.018
- Hands on your heads,
don't move.

46:29.053 --> 46:32.321
- Don't move or I will
fucking shoot you.

46:32.356 --> 46:33.422
- Jonathan Green?

46:35.059 --> 46:37.192
- Hey, darling, I'm home.

46:37.227 --> 46:40.529
- Hands up, put your
fucking gun down, now!

46:40.564 --> 46:42.364
Now, fucking hurry,
get your ass in there!

46:42.399 --> 46:44.099
Move your ass, now!

46:44.134 --> 46:46.635
Now, now, now!

46:48.672 --> 46:50.739
You give me one more look like
that and I'll splatter your

46:50.774 --> 46:52.708
brains all over
this fucking room.

46:52.743 --> 46:56.045
- You follow me and
everything's gonna be all right.

46:56.080 --> 46:58.681
- What are you doing?

47:00.284 --> 47:03.619
- If everyone stays put,
we won't harm her.

47:18.702 --> 47:19.735
- Nola?

47:19.770 --> 47:21.036
- Will, where the fuck were you?

47:21.071 --> 47:22.271
- Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

47:22.306 --> 47:23.772
- Oh my God, get
in the fucking car.

47:23.807 --> 47:24.807
- What's going on?
- Let's go.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.708
- Who's that? Who 'dis?

47:26.743 --> 47:28.210
- It's Andreopoulus' wife.

47:28.245 --> 47:30.813
- Wait, who, that
crazy Greek dude?

47:30.848 --> 47:32.948
Hell, no!
- Yes, go!

47:32.983 --> 47:34.616
- Shit, shit, shit,
shit, come on.

47:34.651 --> 47:37.353
- Go, go, go,
get in the car, go.

47:38.889 --> 47:41.357
- Get in the fucking car.

47:43.494 --> 47:44.827
- Fuck, Will,
what's wrong with you?

47:44.862 --> 47:46.095
- What's wrong with me?
- Yes.

47:47.164 --> 47:48.464
- You don't even know who
you dealin' with, huh?

47:48.499 --> 47:49.798
You don't read the papers.

47:49.833 --> 47:51.934
You don't know that this
psycho raises piranhas.

47:51.969 --> 47:53.235
Piranhas.

47:53.270 --> 47:55.838
- No, not the fish,
I'm begging you, sir.

47:55.873 --> 47:57.673
No, no, let go of me.

47:57.708 --> 47:58.974
- What was I supposed
to do, I mean,

47:59.009 --> 48:00.809
Woody was stuck in bed
with a stomach ache

48:00.844 --> 48:02.811
and we needed a driver.

48:02.846 --> 48:04.680
- What, snap out of it,
Nola, come on now,

48:04.715 --> 48:06.348
you have any idea how
ferocious these fish are?

48:06.383 --> 48:08.117
They can strip a
body in minutes.

48:08.152 --> 48:10.619
Minutes, come on, their
teeth are razor sharp

48:10.654 --> 48:12.121
and once a little
bit of blood come out

48:12.156 --> 48:14.123
one little drop of blood
come out, they go crazy,

48:14.158 --> 48:16.024
frenzied, they don't stop,
they don't stop,

48:16.059 --> 48:17.626
and, nom nom nom nom,

48:17.661 --> 48:19.828
and then at the end of it,
they start eating each other.

48:19.863 --> 48:20.863
Each other!

48:20.898 --> 48:22.798
And I ain't talkin' bout
in a good way either.

48:28.772 --> 48:30.305
You wanna be the next
dish on their menu?

48:30.340 --> 48:32.875
You want this to end
in a blood bath, huh?

48:32.910 --> 48:33.876
- No.

48:35.112 --> 48:35.778
- I was psyched
about my piranha story,

48:36.747 --> 48:37.513
because the girls
were so freaked out,

48:37.548 --> 48:38.847
they didn't say a word

48:38.882 --> 48:42.284
when I told 'em, bring
back his wife immediately.

48:42.319 --> 48:45.888
- Oh, darling, everything's
gonna be fine, now.

48:45.923 --> 48:47.022
The following days,

48:47.057 --> 48:49.958
stormy winds blew
across New Orleans.

48:49.993 --> 48:51.193
Temperatures increased,

48:51.228 --> 48:53.729
and Denzel sank into
a sharp paranoia.

48:54.631 --> 48:56.165
- Hey, have you seen Nola?

48:56.200 --> 48:57.332
Have you seen Nola?
- No.

48:57.367 --> 48:58.634
- No, I haven't seen her.

48:58.669 --> 48:59.735
- What about Woody,
where's Woody at?

48:59.770 --> 49:02.838
- He's in his room, he's sick.

49:02.873 --> 49:04.873
- Woody, Woody wake up.

49:04.908 --> 49:07.976
Nola's gone, wake up, damn it.

49:08.011 --> 49:10.245
- What?

49:10.280 --> 49:12.481
- My sister's missing.

49:13.817 --> 49:16.018
- Wha, wha, what?

49:16.053 --> 49:20.489
- Nola didn't come home last
night, did she say anything?

49:20.524 --> 49:22.558
- What about Will?

49:22.593 --> 49:23.459
- What about Will?

49:23.494 --> 49:24.493
His place is closed
and he isn't home.

49:24.528 --> 49:25.827
- There you go.

49:25.862 --> 49:29.865
They're puh, puh,
probably together.

49:29.900 --> 49:30.933
- They've got nothin'
to do together.

49:30.968 --> 49:33.669
What the fuck are you
gettin' at, you high?

49:37.941 --> 49:39.841
- Their motives remain
unknown but they're described

49:39.876 --> 49:43.779
as two young women
dressed in bunny costumes.

49:44.982 --> 49:46.882
- More details.

49:48.652 --> 49:52.087
- Oh my God, Jonathan Green
is holding auditions--

49:52.122 --> 49:53.055
- I told you that was--

49:53.857 --> 49:54.890
- I gotta call Woody
- Call Woody.

49:54.925 --> 49:56.858
- I gotta call Woody.

49:56.893 --> 49:59.962
God, he's gonna be so happy,
I told you it was him.

50:04.635 --> 50:06.535
- H-Hello.

50:06.570 --> 50:08.237
- Hey, Woody-O, what's up,
you feeling better?

50:08.272 --> 50:12.774
- Nola, your brother just
left my buh, buh, bedroom.

50:12.809 --> 50:13.976
- Woody, let me talk.

50:14.711 --> 50:17.079
Jonathan Green is in town.

50:17.114 --> 50:20.582
- Juh, juh, Jonathan Green?

50:20.617 --> 50:21.917
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

50:21.952 --> 50:23.318
- Oh believe me, that
was him, that was him.

50:23.353 --> 50:25.921
And the paper says he's
holding auditions today

50:25.956 --> 50:28.423
at Algiers Point, so get ready.

50:28.458 --> 50:31.093
- Duh, duh, damn.

51:54.945 --> 51:56.144
- Get in.

51:56.179 --> 51:57.813
- This is magnificent,

52:00.283 --> 52:03.619
hands down,
you're great, Mr. Johnson.

52:06.623 --> 52:09.658
- I told my
husband to leave you alone,

52:09.693 --> 52:13.261
so if you're not
totally unconscious,

52:13.296 --> 52:15.831
I think you should
keep your silence

52:15.866 --> 52:18.533
about Jonathan and myself.

52:18.568 --> 52:21.069
Do you understand, am I clear?

52:21.104 --> 52:23.605
- Very clear, Mrs. Andreopoulus.

52:23.640 --> 52:25.507
- Good, bye.

52:55.238 --> 52:57.406
- You are in so much
trouble right now.

52:57.441 --> 52:58.774
- What are you doing here?

52:58.809 --> 53:00.041
- Come here, we need to talk.

53:00.076 --> 53:01.309
- Easy, you're hurting me,
Denzel.

53:01.344 --> 53:03.044
- Chill out, Denzel,
you're gonna break her arm.

53:03.079 --> 53:04.646
- You stay the hell out of this,
that's what you do.

53:04.681 --> 53:05.981
- What's wrong with you?

53:06.016 --> 53:06.982
- I swear to you
I'm gonna rid you

53:07.017 --> 53:08.550
of this Broadway bullshit.

53:08.585 --> 53:10.786
And from now on, you're
gonna stop seeing Karen.

53:10.821 --> 53:12.421
- I can't take it anymore,
Denzel.

53:12.456 --> 53:15.056
Stop telling me what to do,
I'm a big girl, you know.

53:15.091 --> 53:17.159
- You are my kid sister
and I'm gonna protect you

53:17.194 --> 53:18.560
whether you like it or not.

53:18.595 --> 53:20.395
I'll be damned if you gonna
end up in some strip club.

53:20.430 --> 53:21.296
- Fuck you!

53:21.331 --> 53:22.831
- You wanna bunch of strange men

53:22.866 --> 53:24.766
slappin' you on your ass callin'
you a fuckin' snow bunny?

53:24.801 --> 53:27.068
- Calm down, Denzel,
we didn't do anything wrong.

53:27.103 --> 53:28.437
- Yeah, like I'm
gonna believe you.

53:28.472 --> 53:29.304
Get back, and you know better.

53:29.339 --> 53:31.273
- Duh, duh, Denzel!

53:31.308 --> 53:34.509
- Yeah, duh, duh, duh,
Denzel, my ass.

53:34.544 --> 53:36.344
Stay away from her.

54:04.207 --> 54:04.973
You'll have plenty
of time to think this

54:05.008 --> 54:06.308
all the way through,

54:06.343 --> 54:08.109
because you're not gonna
leave the room until I say so.

54:08.144 --> 54:09.111
What the fuck are you
doing here you cr--

54:11.548 --> 54:14.650
- Stop, Denzel, stop.

54:17.287 --> 54:19.688
Oh, my God, stop, stop!

54:19.723 --> 54:22.858
Denzel!

54:22.893 --> 54:25.026
Stop, you're gonna kill him.

54:25.061 --> 54:27.629
Stop, stop Denzel, please.

54:33.670 --> 54:35.570
- I don't know
about the stormy weather,

54:35.605 --> 54:38.640
but you could show him anything
from tomatoes to mozzarella

54:38.675 --> 54:41.810
or pepperoni, or even the
fucking Mario Brothers,

54:41.845 --> 54:44.579
and he'd go nuts,
fucking insane.

54:44.614 --> 54:46.581
So I wasn't in a
real hurry to explain

54:46.616 --> 54:49.351
what was going on between
me and his sister.

54:49.386 --> 54:51.153
That could wait.

54:53.189 --> 54:54.156
Nola!

54:54.658 --> 54:56.324
Nola!

54:56.359 --> 54:59.160
Nola, Nola, open this door.

54:59.195 --> 55:02.097
Nola, Nola, Nola, open up.

55:04.367 --> 55:06.268
I don't know, whenever
I look at you, Nola,

55:06.303 --> 55:08.236
I still see that
12-year old little girl

55:08.271 --> 55:09.404
comin' home from school,

55:09.439 --> 55:11.239
I can still hear you laugh.

55:11.274 --> 55:15.710
- I'm not 12, anymore, Denzel.

55:15.745 --> 55:19.915
- I made a promise to Mom
that I was gonna protect you.

55:19.950 --> 55:21.517
I'm not gonna give up now.

55:22.519 --> 55:24.853
- Keep her out of this,

55:24.888 --> 55:27.990
you didn't visit
her grave for years.

55:46.876 --> 55:50.879
- Muh, Marvin, I gotta go.

55:50.914 --> 55:53.381
- Wha, why would you wanna go?

55:53.416 --> 55:54.716
To listen to that gibberish?

55:54.751 --> 55:57.052
- Buh, but you promised.

55:57.087 --> 56:00.322
- Go ahead, go on, go.

56:00.890 --> 56:04.426
- Kahn, sweep the salon.

56:04.461 --> 56:06.895
- Hathi, sweep the salon.

56:06.930 --> 56:08.096
- Can't you see I'm busy.

56:08.131 --> 56:10.265
- Sweep the salon, I said.

56:10.300 --> 56:14.069
- Marvin, why am I always
the one gettin' played?

56:14.104 --> 56:16.104
Kahn always tellin' me to
do what you told him to do.

56:16.139 --> 56:19.407
- Hathi, I tell you what
Marvin tells me to do

56:19.442 --> 56:20.809
because you never
know what to do

56:20.844 --> 56:23.912
until I tell you
what to do, so do it.

56:23.947 --> 56:26.348
- I don't want to do what
Marvin told you to do anymore.

56:26.383 --> 56:27.616
- Marvin never told you to

56:27.651 --> 56:29.451
make me do what
you supposed to do.

56:29.486 --> 56:31.119
He told you to do it.

56:31.154 --> 56:33.021
And besides, sweeping the salon,
that's Woody's job.

56:33.056 --> 56:34.456
Woody's the one who's
supposed to sweep--

56:34.491 --> 56:36.424
- Forget Woody, nevermind
what Marvin told me to do

56:36.459 --> 56:39.494
or not to do,
I'm telling you to do it.

56:39.529 --> 56:40.261
- I'm sick of
doing everything--

56:40.296 --> 56:41.997
- Shut up!

56:42.032 --> 56:44.299
You think I need this right now?

56:44.334 --> 56:46.501
Don't I have enough trouble
with Karen as it is?

56:46.536 --> 56:49.037
I don't wanna hear you anymore.

56:49.072 --> 56:50.338
- Tell it to Kahn.

56:50.373 --> 56:51.539
- You know what, me, too.

56:51.574 --> 56:53.141
I'm sick of this shit-ass life

56:53.176 --> 56:56.611
in this salon that
smells like dead rats.

56:56.646 --> 57:01.349
- Now, dead rats, huh?

57:01.384 --> 57:04.185
That's a real stench.

57:04.220 --> 57:07.789
Do you know how hard it was
for me to get this place going?

57:07.824 --> 57:09.190
The sacrifices I made?

57:09.225 --> 57:11.793
Now, we may not
have the best customers.

57:12.629 --> 57:14.829
But it's a respectable business,

57:14.864 --> 57:17.465
and it makes us a living.

57:17.500 --> 57:19.067
Anything else you want to add?

57:19.102 --> 57:20.669
- Of course not, Marvin.

57:20.704 --> 57:24.272
- So sweep the fucking salon.

57:27.010 --> 57:28.977
- You ass.

57:31.981 --> 57:33.482
Psst.

58:02.178 --> 58:04.146
- Nola, Nola, what's wrong,
baby, what's wrong?

58:05.014 --> 58:08.283
- Denzel is furious,
he locked me inside my room.

58:08.318 --> 58:09.618
- Locked you inside, what?

58:10.653 --> 58:11.920
- Are you listening
to what I'm saying?

58:11.955 --> 58:13.221
- Just dry your tears,
baby, tell me.

58:13.256 --> 58:15.090
- He beat the shit out
of a pizza delivery guy,

58:15.125 --> 58:16.558
you gotta talk to him, Will.

58:16.593 --> 58:18.126
- Of course I'm gonna
talk to him, baby.

58:18.161 --> 58:19.928
- Don't touch me, don't kiss me.

58:19.963 --> 58:21.596
Fuck you all!

58:21.631 --> 58:23.264
- Sit down.

58:23.299 --> 58:25.033
Look, Nola, you need to stop
messin' around, you hear me?

58:25.068 --> 58:26.768
I know the Greek kidnappin'
wasn't a big deal to you,

58:26.803 --> 58:28.403
but it's still on my mind,

58:28.438 --> 58:30.438
so now ain't the time to be
harassing me about Denzel.

58:30.473 --> 58:31.406
- Hey Will!

58:33.510 --> 58:34.542
Will!

58:36.713 --> 58:37.712
I've already been through

58:37.747 --> 58:39.981
plenty of weird
moments in my life.

58:40.016 --> 58:43.251
So I knew this one would
come up eventually.

58:43.286 --> 58:45.286
- I don't know why you
haven't told him yet,

58:45.321 --> 58:47.422
life would be a lot
simpler if you do it.

58:47.457 --> 58:49.391
- Yeah, simpler for you,
not for me, I mean,

58:50.426 --> 58:51.993
I don't know if you know this,
but your brother gets

58:52.028 --> 58:54.562
just a bit nervous
when talkin' about you.

58:54.597 --> 58:56.931
- Is anybody there?

58:56.966 --> 58:59.000
Will!

59:02.605 --> 59:05.573
Hey Will!

59:05.608 --> 59:07.876
Will!

59:12.348 --> 59:14.182
Hey, you in there?

59:28.064 --> 59:29.664
Hey Will!

59:29.699 --> 59:32.033
Is anybody there?

59:32.068 --> 59:32.801
Will?

59:32.836 --> 59:33.701
- What do you think?

59:33.736 --> 59:34.969
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

59:35.004 --> 59:36.604
You go put this
dress on right now.

59:36.639 --> 59:38.540
- Watch out, if you take
one more step I'll scream.

59:38.575 --> 59:40.341
- Nola, the show's over,
baby, all right?

59:40.376 --> 59:41.609
You gotta put this
dress on all right.

59:41.644 --> 59:42.844
- Will, open up!

59:42.879 --> 59:44.112
- Are you gonna talk to him?

59:44.147 --> 59:45.013
- Get dressed!

59:45.048 --> 59:47.048
- No.

59:47.083 --> 59:49.017
- All right I had it, you gonna
put this dress on right now.

59:49.052 --> 59:51.119
- Let go of me, animal, you're
no better than my brother.

59:51.454 --> 59:52.353
- Put your clothes on!

59:52.388 --> 59:53.655
- No!

59:53.690 --> 59:55.023
- What the hell are
you doing up in-- open!

59:55.058 --> 59:56.458
- No, no!

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:02.330
- Nola?

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:07.702
- I'm gonna have
five seconds to make up a story

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:09.370
and save my ass.

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:12.740
Five, four, three, two,

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:14.576
- Will, what the fuck--?

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.544
- Now don't you go up
asking me things, Denzel.

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:18.980
Your sister walked into my
shop just ten minutes ago

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:21.649
shocked cause of the pizza
delivery boy you beat up,

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:23.785
I mean, damn, Denzel, when
you gonna grow up, huh?

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:26.321
She don't even know
when you gonna grow up.

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:28.156
Now, you need to take
her home right now

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:29.724
before she catches cold,
you hear me?

01:00:29.759 --> 01:00:31.593
Now, now, now, watch her head,
watch her head, come on.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.661
Easy, easy, all right.

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:35.931
- As incredible as
it may seem,

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:38.366
that was it.

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:40.568
Denzel left with his sister.

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:42.537
I knew she was gonna
drive me crazy,

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:44.372
but what else was I gonna do?

01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:46.207
Thunderstorms was
announced that afternoon

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:48.676
and record-high temperatures
for the next night, I mean,

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:50.979
I had no choice, you know?

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:33.288
- I think we should bring
in some gluten-free dough,

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:34.589
because some people
want to eat here--

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:38.693
- Get the fuck outta here with
that gluten-free shit again.

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:42.630
Fuckin' asshole.

01:01:42.665 --> 01:01:43.631
Napoli Pizza.

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:44.732
- Gesuippe, it's Enzo.

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:46.167
- Enzo, hey, did you find him?

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:47.468
- Found him?

01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:48.636
Listen, the cocksucker
beat the shit out of me

01:01:48.671 --> 01:01:49.771
ten minutes ago.

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:51.472
- Oh, I love you, Enzo.

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:52.640
- The guy's a monster,

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:55.610
he had some woman on
his arms unconscious.

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:58.012
God only knows what kind of
horrible shit he did to her.

01:01:58.047 --> 01:01:59.480
OK, OK, calm down.

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:00.815
Are you sure it was him?

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:01.849
- What the fuck do
you mean am I sure?

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:03.818
How many black guys
with white Afros

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:05.119
do you know go around

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:06.454
beating the shit out
of anything that moves?

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:07.755
- OK, calm down, Enzo.

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:09.490
- Don't fucking tell
me to calm down.

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:11.292
That cocksucker, he

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:13.494
beat me over my head
with a trash can lid.

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:15.697
- God, I love you right now,
I could mouth kiss you.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.498
All right, listen to me, listen
to me, what do we do now,

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:18.800
Enzo, do you know
where he lives?

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:19.934
- Yeah, yeah, I'm
right next door.

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:21.336
Look Gesuippe, you
gotta come get me,

01:02:21.371 --> 01:02:22.503
I think I need a doctor,

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:24.539
we'll get the
motherfucker tomorrow.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:25.940
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
of course, OK.

01:02:25.975 --> 01:02:28.743
I'll be right over, listen,
don't worry all right?

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:30.712
When we're done with him,
we're gonna fuck him so hard

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:34.716
in his ass he's gonna
look like a real baboon.

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:38.486
Boom!

01:02:39.288 --> 01:02:40.922
Oh, fuck.

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:42.824
Oh shit, my spine.

01:02:42.859 --> 01:02:45.427
Grab-- Grab my hand.

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:47.963
I can't stand up, asshole!

01:03:42.452 --> 01:03:46.054
- Come on, come on,
Edelweiss...

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:49.390
- What's that, Poppy?

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:51.826
- Edelweiss,
that's his code name.

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:54.329
- What's up with these
stupid flower names, anyway?

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:57.865
- Chill out, Poppy,
you respect the rules.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.936
I got him from the pound,
the owner says he's a killer.

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:03.404
- What, a hound?

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:05.106
Are you kidding me?

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:07.242
- He's not just any hound,
he's a killer.

01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:10.044
Bark, Edelweiss, bark.

01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:11.879
See, sit, Edelweiss, sit.

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:14.015
Let me see your paw,
let me see your paw.

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:19.921
- What the fuck,
is he pissing in the car?

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.723
- Stop pissing, Edelweiss.

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:24.759
- The dog is pissing in the car,

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:26.761
the dog is pissing in the car.

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:28.896
- What do you care, the car's
a piece of shit, anyways.

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:30.832
If you slam the door,
the roof opens.

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:34.669
- That's why I bought it,
you fucking moron.

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:36.771
- Well, I can't tell him
to stop pissing in the car.

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:39.640
- Let me explain
something to you, Poppy.

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:41.742
If you let the dog piss
in the car like this,

01:04:41.777 --> 01:04:43.811
what do you think will happen?

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:46.180
He's gonna think that
he can piss in any car.

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:49.617
So-- So if I buy
a new car,
he's gonna think,

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:51.186
I got a fancy new toilet.

01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:55.957
Stop this motherfucker
from pissing in the car.

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:59.327
- And tell him to stop
giving me the stink eye.

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:00.795
- What are you talking about?

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:02.797
He's not giving
you the stink eye.

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:04.799
- I don't like the way
he's looking at me.

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:07.435
Now you's tell him to stop
looking at me like that,

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:09.971
or I'm gonna put
a bullet in his head.

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:11.038
- You can't shoot a dog,

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:12.373
that's just the way
he looks, all right?

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:14.142
He can't do nothin' about that.

01:05:14.177 --> 01:05:15.943
- Tell him to stop
giving me the stink eye.

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:17.278
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you can't shoot the dog,

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:18.613
you can't shoot him,
Lilac, say something,

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:19.914
he's gonna make a mess.

01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:22.617
- I don't give a shit, it's
goin' to the junkyard anyway.

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:26.053
- I'm gonna open you up,
you piece of shit dog.

01:05:26.088 --> 01:05:26.921
- Oh, I got an idea, I got
an idea, I got an idea,

01:05:27.957 --> 01:05:29.257
OK, OK?

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:31.759
See? Problem solved.

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:36.898
- There we go.
Finally!

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:46.474
- We're here.

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:47.975
- OK, good,
everybody knows what they're

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:49.076
supposed to do, right?

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:50.912
- Trust me, that motherfucker's
gonna feel the pain.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:53.247
Every last fucking ounce of it.

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:55.416
- All right, listen to me,
remember, keep your cool,

01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:57.151
I want that cocksucker alive,
he's gotta be able to

01:05:57.186 --> 01:05:58.753
explain everything to Amanda.

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:01.255
- Trust me, you're gonna
have all the time you need

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:02.890
to get all the information

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:04.225
you need.
- Good.

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.661
But when you finish,
I'm gonna take the motherfucker,

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:08.829
I'm gonna
throw him in the basement,
I'm gonna beat him

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:12.033
with a welding machine for
seven days and seven nights.

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:13.868
And when I finish,
I'm gonna take him

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:15.570
and throw him in
the fuckin' sewer,

01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:17.905
and let him fuckin' rot,
until the rats come

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:21.976
in his god damn intestines.

01:06:22.845 --> 01:06:25.046
- Seven days and seven nights?

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:28.716
We're not gonna get much sleep.

01:06:30.686 --> 01:06:33.521
Oh, what the hell is this?

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:35.957
- What, what, what's
happening now?

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:37.291
Tell me, what.

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:40.528
- I don't know, three guys
in KKK outfits just drove in.

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:41.862
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:06:41.897 --> 01:06:43.531
- They're
going in the salon.

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:44.432
- The salon?

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:45.633
What the fuck are you talk--?

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:46.968
What the fuck is
happening over there?

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:48.402
- What the fuck I know,
you're paying me to get him,

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:51.673
not to look through walls.

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:56.043
Ah, there you are, cocksucker.

01:06:56.078 --> 01:06:57.378
- Hey, Will!
- Look at that.

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:59.280
- What?
What's happening?

01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:00.648
That's the guy?

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.450
- The fuck you
lookin' at, nigger?

01:07:02.485 --> 01:07:04.485
- What the, oh!

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.753
- Fuck.

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:06.988
- What's happening?
Let me know.

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:09.824
- The, the, the, the
guys in the KKK outfit,

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:11.058
they're beating the
shit out of the--

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:12.960
he's bleeding,
he's on the floor.

01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:14.128
- What?

01:07:14.163 --> 01:07:15.129
Are you kidding me?

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:16.831
- What do you want me to do?

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.232
What the fuck you want me to do?

01:07:18.267 --> 01:07:20.134
- You get in there, and
you fucking save his ass,

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:23.371
so you can bring him back
here so I can kick his ass.

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:37.885
- Hey, hey,
there they are, right there.

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:40.621
- Come on.

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:42.290
- Ah, shit, fuck.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:49.931
- What are they doin'?

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:24.399
- Let's get him, let's go.
Let's go.

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:44.251
OK, we're on the bridge,
do you see anything?

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:46.254
There's nobody here, no.

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:56.564
- Oh shit, shit.

01:08:56.599 --> 01:08:57.865
- Enzo, listen to me,
listen to me.

01:08:57.899 --> 01:09:00.401
That cocksucker,
that god damned cocksucker

01:09:00.435 --> 01:09:03.069
smashed my neck and Amanda's
coming home tomorrow,

01:09:03.104 --> 01:09:04.272
I need him alive!

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:07.041
- Giuseppe, ,
I understand
you need him alive.

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:09.076
- The van!

01:09:11.947 --> 01:09:12.747
- What the f--?

01:09:12.782 --> 01:09:14.682
What?!
Enzo, what happened?

01:09:14.716 --> 01:09:17.017
- God damnit,
motherfucker, cocksucker.

01:09:17.051 --> 01:09:18.353
- Hello?

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:20.520
Fuck!

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:22.622
- Fuck.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:25.560
- Shit.

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:40.640
- Hello?
- Hello?

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:43.644
Nola, is that you?

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:45.212
What happened?

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:47.448
Calm down, baby, where are you?

01:09:47.483 --> 01:09:49.082
- In the apartment...

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:51.853
- Stay where you are, alright?
Don't move, I'll be right there.

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:06.066
Are you all right,
what happened?

01:10:06.101 --> 01:10:08.235
- I just got a little scared,
that's all.

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:11.338
- Who did this to you?

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:13.574
Nola, who did this to you?

01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:15.142
- Marvin.

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:17.111
- What? Marvin?

01:10:19.682 --> 01:10:22.616
- He didn't recognize
me Denzel, I swear,

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:24.852
He had a weird haircut,
it was crazy.

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:28.255
- Marvin did this to you?

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:30.458
Get in.

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:35.930
- Don't, Denz, I think he was stoned.
 Don't!

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:37.832
- Lock the door.

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:50.144
- Oh, Denzel.
You wanna use the phone?

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:54.281
- I swear on
my mother's grave,

01:10:54.316 --> 01:10:56.751
touch her again
and I'll fuckin' kill you.

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:08.829
Oh shit, you motherfuckers.

01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:11.465
You mother--
What the fuck is all this?

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.868
- All right, listen, we can
explain that, all right.

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:16.203
The KKK costumes,
it was Marvin's idea.

01:11:16.238 --> 01:11:18.205
- It was all Marvin's plan,
man, all right.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.074
He went crazy, man, he
even shot me in my foot.

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:21.475
- Wait, what are
you talkin' about?

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:23.677
- The whole KKK thing, man,
it was just to scare Will

01:11:23.712 --> 01:11:24.778
you know?
- Yeah.

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:26.180
- And try to get
some of his customers, man.

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.081
You, you weren't supposed to be

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.349
involved with that at all, man,

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:29.350
that wasn't supposed
to be you there.

01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:30.384
- Exactly, come on,

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:32.319
you know Marvin's been
goin' crazy lately,

01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:33.654
you know what I'm sayin'?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:35.489
- You know, and when
he broke up with Karen,

01:11:35.524 --> 01:11:36.757
you know--

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:37.992
- Which one of you
knocked me out?

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:38.859
- Kahn.

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:39.693
- Hathi.

01:11:39.728 --> 01:11:40.694
- Kahn.
- Hathi!

01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:41.929
- Kahn.
- Hathi.

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:43.097
- Kahn, Kahn, Kahn!
- Hathi!

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.164
- I'm telling you
right now, that motherfucker

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.866
is crazy, he the one that
knocked you out, man.

01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:48.102
I'm telling you, whoa whoa whoa.

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:50.504
- One more time, one more time.

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:51.772
Which one of you knocked me out?

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:52.706
- I'm telling you, man,
it was him.

01:11:52.741 --> 01:11:54.975
- I did, I did, OK?
I did.

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:56.510
I didn't really have a choice,
man, come on,

01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:58.379
I, I, I, I, I know
you understand, right?

01:11:58.414 --> 01:12:01.015
You understand what I'm sayin',
it's Marvin.

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:13.227
- Do we have to do
it like this, man?

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:17.264
Come on, we could--

01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:20.801
- All right, Klu Klux Kahn,
tell me your story.

01:12:20.836 --> 01:12:25.172
- All right, OK, tonight...

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:28.776
Will gave his sermon
about Rosa Parks.

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:32.913
- What led a 42-year-old
black seamstress to rise,

01:12:32.948 --> 01:12:37.017
- to rise, to rise against the establishment?
-  - Dignity!

01:12:37.052 --> 01:12:40.220
Yeah, you right, my sister,
dignity, dignity.

01:12:40.255 --> 01:12:43.324
The deep consciousness
of her human dignity.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:44.859
Yeah, you right, dignity.

01:12:45.394 --> 01:12:47.394
Best to be, Sister Rosa Parks.

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:57.471
- And everything was set, we
waited for the salon to empty,

01:12:57.506 --> 01:12:59.006
and he was by himself,

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:02.576
and we came in dressed
in our costumes.

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:03.911
It wasn't about hurting him.

01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:06.614
It was about scaring him
just a little bit.

01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:09.416
Marvin, he went nuts.

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:12.319
A few minutes earlier,
he popped some pills,

01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:14.021
and I told him not to.

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:15.456
But he didn't care.

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:17.992
Orchid, don't, those
pills are loaded.

01:13:18.027 --> 01:13:20.995
Yolanda took some and
had the worst trip.

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:23.430
- Shut the fuck up.

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:27.334
Hermie, I know what I'm doing.

01:13:27.369 --> 01:13:30.504
Get yourself ready.

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:31.839
Where the fuck is he?

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:34.441
- That shit totally ruined
his brain, man, I don't know,

01:13:34.476 --> 01:13:36.377
you know, he went half nuts.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:40.981
He told us he would kill us
if we don't hold Will down.

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:42.549
What would you have done?

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:45.486
It's only later when we
took all his clothes off

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:47.521
and put a bag on his head,
that you showed up.

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:50.891
Listen, I can assure you,
that was not part of the plan.

01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:53.661
OK, I only hit you
and knocked you out

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:56.730
because I was afraid that
Marvin was gonna shoot you.

01:13:56.765 --> 01:13:58.332
Hey man, this thing is
really starting to get hot.

01:13:58.367 --> 01:13:59.633
- So what did you do with Will?

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:02.069
- We, we brought him to,

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:03.404
to Saint Thomas Bayou.

01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:11.245
- Take off your jocks, nigger.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:15.349
Come on, get naked, I want
to see you naked as a worm.

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:16.583
- Orchid, what are you doing?

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:17.818
- Shut up!

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:20.054
Come on, motherfucker,
get naked.

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:24.391
Take off those
fucking jocks, nigger.

01:14:24.426 --> 01:14:27.828
Get naked, I wanna see
you naked, now come on.

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:35.669
You gonna run, you gonna run,

01:14:35.704 --> 01:14:38.739
and pray that your heart stops

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:43.077
before the beast of the bayou
here eats you alive.

01:14:43.112 --> 01:14:44.378
Turn.

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.383
And run.

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:50.517
- All right, so that's where
shit just got out of hand.

01:14:50.552 --> 01:14:53.554
Like this is out of hand, OK?

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:56.190
Edelweiss looked at him funny,
he shot it and missed,

01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:58.125
and then hit Hathi in the foot.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.427
- Still don't like the way
that dog's lookin' at me, man,

01:15:00.462 --> 01:15:01.528
you heard me?

01:15:01.563 --> 01:15:03.130
- What are you talking about?

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:05.365
He's not lookin' at you.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.067
- That dog keeps
lookin' at me like that,

01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:09.570
I'm gonna shoot that dog,
you heard?

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:12.106
- You better not shoot him,
you better not shoot him,

01:15:12.141 --> 01:15:13.107
you understand me?

01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:14.041
You better not shoot him!

01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:14.775
- Oh yeah?

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:18.646
- Ooh!
- Edelweiss?

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:21.081
- Yes, that's the code
name for the fucking dog.

01:15:21.117 --> 01:15:22.983
Don't you know that I hate dogs?
Did you ever know that about me?

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:24.885
I fuckin' hate dogs, man,
they ain't good for shit,

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.420
but to bark, piss,
and shit everywhere.

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:27.454
- How did it end?

01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:29.156
- I'm on fuckin' frying
right now, man, please!

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:32.059
- You better speak before I
smoke your ass here all night.

01:15:32.094 --> 01:15:34.061
Talk!
- OK, OK.

01:15:34.096 --> 01:15:35.596
- He kept shootin' the dog,
OK, and I told him,

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:37.464
man, stop shootin' the dog
or whatever, but one of 'em

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:40.601
got away, hit Will, Will hit
the ground, man, I'm so sorry.

01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:42.903
I'm so sorry.

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:46.640
Things just happened
too fast, man.

01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:49.109
Come on, get me
out of here, man,

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:50.744
I am burning up.

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:52.746
Come on, man,
turn this shit off, all right?

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:55.215
You know everything right now.
You know everything, OK?

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:56.116
There's nothing more to say.

01:15:56.151 --> 01:15:57.151
We came back to the shop,

01:15:57.186 --> 01:15:58.485
Marvin, went to move the car,

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.521
we were taking off our
makeup and I was tendin'

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.689
to his fucking foot over
there and then you walked in.

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:04.691
OK? I'm burning, man!

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.093
- Hello, hello!

01:16:06.762 --> 01:16:08.629
Hello, is anybody there?

01:16:08.664 --> 01:16:11.465
Hello, hello,
hello, hello, hello.

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.333
Oh hey, hi.
- Fuck!

01:16:13.368 --> 01:16:14.601
- Hey, hey.

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:16.203
- What the hell
are you doing here?

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:18.305
- Oh I, uh, um, uh,

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:21.041
looking for the guys
with the colored undies.

01:16:21.076 --> 01:16:22.810
- For what?

01:16:22.845 --> 01:16:26.113
- I, uh, I need the pills.

01:16:26.148 --> 01:16:27.614
- Forget it, I'm out.

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:31.786
- You don't understand,
I need those fucking pills!

01:16:32.454 --> 01:16:35.790
Those fucking pills!
- Get of me!

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:39.893
- Karen? Oh my God!

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:41.762
Come on.
- My pills!

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:44.097
Oh my God, who is that girl?

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:45.166
- She's a friend
of Kahn and Hathi.

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:48.101
She took the fucking pills.
- What's going on?

01:16:48.136 --> 01:16:49.570
- There's ketamine
in the fucking pills.

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:52.573
- Calm down, Karen, calm down.
- No, no, those damn
motherfuckers act directly

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:54.408
on the central nervous system.

01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:08.188
- She dead?

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:09.523
- I don't fucking know.

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:11.625
- What do we do, Karen?
- I don't know.

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:16.864
Fuck, grab her, come on.

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:19.834
Bitch is heavy.

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:27.941
- Oh help, help!
You gonna toast me right now?

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:31.678
Oh my goodness,
turn this shit off!

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:35.149
Come on man, oh God, oh shit!

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:39.152
- My God, what?

01:17:39.187 --> 01:17:40.254
What is going on here?

01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:41.521
- I'm burnin'!

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:43.190
- These fuckers assaulted Will.

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:46.593
- What? Where is he?

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:48.595
Fuck, Denzel, where is he?

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:50.097
- Saint Thomas Bayou.

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:51.598
- Saint Thomas Bayou.
- Nola, wait!

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:52.699
- Nola, wait.

01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:53.901
- Hey no, hey, Karen,

01:17:53.936 --> 01:17:55.202
Karen!

01:17:55.237 --> 01:17:56.703
Karen, turn it off,
come here, come here!

01:17:56.738 --> 01:17:58.572
Turn it off, Karen,
get over here.

01:17:58.607 --> 01:18:01.041
Turn it off, now.

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:07.014
¶ High life

01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:10.951
¶ Wherever I look

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:13.721
¶ It's only green lights

01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:18.725
¶ I'm flyin' above the birds

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.161
¶ High in the trees

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:22.496
¶ Singin' with me

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.765
¶ I'm feelin' so free today

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.500
¶ I kissed my bride ¶

01:19:20.655 --> 01:19:23.657
- My name's Will,
and as far as I can remember,

01:19:23.692 --> 01:19:26.626
I always dreamt
of having an Afro,

01:19:26.661 --> 01:19:29.196
it's the symbol of
my individuality.

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:33.067
The symbol of all the struggles
against the oppressor.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:20.847
- Will!

01:20:20.882 --> 01:20:21.782
- Nola?

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:23.550
- Will, Will.

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:25.385
- Nola, Nola?

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:27.621
- Baby, it's me
- Nola, Nola?

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:32.125
- Oh my God, what have they
done to you, don't move.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.062
Oh my God.

01:20:35.097 --> 01:20:36.830
- Baby.

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:48.075
- Oh, they shaved your Afro.

01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:51.412
- It's all right, baby,
it's all right, you here.

01:20:56.918 --> 01:20:58.051
- It was so scary.

01:20:58.086 --> 01:21:01.088
- It's just fine, it looks
worse than it is, all right?

01:21:10.065 --> 01:21:12.066
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:21:13.735 --> 01:21:16.603
A few months later,
we were at the church

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:18.638
celebratin' our wedding.

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:20.774
Denzel had finally
opened his eyes

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:22.909
and accepted the situation.

01:21:22.944 --> 01:21:24.811
He had done a lot
of work on himself.

01:21:24.846 --> 01:21:27.481
He even forgave Marvin.

01:21:27.516 --> 01:21:29.583
- Nola was more
beautiful than ever.

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:31.451
Now our honeymoon to Broadway

01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:34.121
was scheduled for next fall.

01:21:34.156 --> 01:21:37.157
Woody got a call back
from Jonathan Green.

01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:39.993
Karen stopped cuttin'
pills with ketamine,

01:21:40.028 --> 01:21:43.096
Marvin was tryin' to
regain Karen's heart,

01:21:43.131 --> 01:21:46.666
pizza boys started delivering
in the neighborhood again,

01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:47.801
and Algiers Point

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:52.372
had gone back to its
legendary quietness.

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:55.876
Me, I'm just waitin'
for my bride.

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:58.812
And for my hair to grow back.

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:48.195
- You may all be seated.

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:54.000
In the name of the
Father, the Son,

01:22:54.035 --> 01:22:56.536
and the Holy Spirit,

01:22:56.571 --> 01:22:57.904
amen.

01:22:57.939 --> 01:23:00.340
- Amen.

01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:02.576
- We are gathered here today

01:23:02.611 --> 01:23:05.612
to celebrate this union

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:08.782
of Nola and Will.

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:12.419
Let us pray.

01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:15.522
Father, you have blessed

01:23:15.557 --> 01:23:17.691
the wedding

01:23:17.726 --> 01:23:21.528
and called it to be
a spiritual marriage.

01:23:23.865 --> 01:23:24.631
- Psst.

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:26.366
- Symbolic of your love

01:23:27.402 --> 01:23:29.236
for your son, Jesus Christ.

01:23:32.907 --> 01:23:36.576
And of our Father

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:40.313
who lives and reigns with you,

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:42.549
and of the Holy Ghost,

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:46.319
one God forever.

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:47.988
- I'm sorry, Father, let her go.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:49.422
- What are you doing, Denzel?

01:23:49.457 --> 01:23:51.758
- Look, trust me Nola, OK?
I know what's good for ya.

01:23:51.793 --> 01:23:54.094
- No, what are
you doing, Denzel!

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:55.629
- Sorry, Will, I'm
not in the mood.
