WEBVTT

00:03.403 --> 00:04.770
No kiss for your father?

00:04.772 --> 00:06.005
What are you doing here?

00:06.007 --> 00:07.139
My father's in town.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.474
Even his own people
do not know he's here.

00:08.476 --> 00:11.076
Vance: Arash kazmi
is eli's new vivac contemporary.

00:11.078 --> 00:12.144
Iranian intelligence.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.013
We recognize the
need for this kind

00:14.015 --> 00:16.749
Of open, honest
dialogue.

00:16.751 --> 00:19.151
I think you're confusing
retiring with repenting.

00:19.153 --> 00:23.088
Then let this visit be your
first step to my redemption.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.590
An innocent man is dead.

00:24.592 --> 00:27.726
You disposed of his body,
and you lied about it.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.461
You're going out of your way

00:29.463 --> 00:30.662
In welcoming me, jackie.

00:30.664 --> 00:34.700
My father killed tyler wilkes.
(gunshots)

00:39.105 --> 00:40.773
Director vance...
I need more towels!

00:40.775 --> 00:41.774
<i>Abba!</i>

00:41.776 --> 00:44.610
(speaking hebrew)

00:48.114 --> 00:49.114
Leon...

00:49.116 --> 00:51.617
She's dead.

00:57.123 --> 00:59.124
Eli:
It's your turn, ziva.

00:59.126 --> 01:00.492
Say the blessing.

01:09.302 --> 01:11.603

01:35.161 --> 01:38.297
Why?

01:38.299 --> 01:39.865
Why should I not be angry?

01:39.867 --> 01:44.269
With all that has been taken?

01:44.271 --> 01:48.140
Why should I have
faith in you?

01:48.142 --> 01:49.374
Show me a sign.

01:49.376 --> 01:54.746
Show me a sign
that I should not lose hope.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.190
Tony.

02:05.192 --> 02:06.458
You haven't been
answering your cell,

02:06.460 --> 02:09.261
So I had mcgee
do that "ping" thing.

02:09.263 --> 02:13.665
I should've known...
Here you are.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.801
What do you want?

02:15.803 --> 02:17.169
I want whatever
you want.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.537
Whatever you need.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.372
A friend to talk to.

02:20.374 --> 02:23.175
A shoulder to cry on.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.910
I'm done crying.

02:24.912 --> 02:30.182
(sighs)
ziva, I am sorry.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.817
I appreciate that.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.753
But sympathy's the last thing
I want right now.

02:34.755 --> 02:39.892
Okay, then, tell me...

02:42.228 --> 02:44.763
What can I do?

02:44.765 --> 02:46.431
What do you need?

02:50.737 --> 02:53.338
Revenge.

03:25.838 --> 03:27.406
That's affirmative, sir.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.974
The shooter's dead,
but those who hired him

03:28.976 --> 03:30.342
Are still at large.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.611
Of course, sir.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.246
Potus is on board.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.281
Secretary of state's
giving us 48 hours

03:36.283 --> 03:37.916
Before telling israel
what happened.

03:37.918 --> 03:38.984
We don't need
that long.
You already have

03:38.986 --> 03:40.852
An idea of who's
behind this?
Might.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.988
It should never have
come to this, gibbs.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.290
You should've
told me the moment

03:45.292 --> 03:46.725
That eli david set foot
on american soil.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.860
I don't report to you,
mr. Secretary.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.395
Well, then director vance
should have told me.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.331
But somebody should
have damn well told me.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.398
Eli david arrived
here one day

03:53.400 --> 03:54.600
And was dead
the next.

03:54.602 --> 03:55.801
Wasn't a lot
to tell.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.402
Well, certainly is now.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.005
Word of eli's death gets out,
there'll be finger-pointing

04:00.007 --> 04:02.007
From baghdad to belgrade,
not to mention

04:02.009 --> 04:04.943
The palestinians, the iranians
and every single

04:04.945 --> 04:07.479
Radical group that's going to
line up to take credit for it.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.248
The wagons are circled.

04:09.250 --> 04:12.484
It's a secret worth keeping,
if it prevents war.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.019
Good.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.725
You talk to leon?

04:19.727 --> 04:21.960
Not since last night.

04:21.962 --> 04:25.264
And deputy director craig--
I suppose he's off

04:25.266 --> 04:27.466
Visiting another
port of call?
On a flight
back home now.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.334
I hope he's up to filling
the director's shoes

04:29.336 --> 04:30.469
At a time like this.

04:30.471 --> 04:33.805
He won't have a choice.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.777
Rest in peace, jackie.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.980
Hey, duck.

04:43.483 --> 04:44.616
You all right?

04:44.618 --> 04:47.319
Just finished
with mrs. Vance.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.554
Single gunshot

04:49.556 --> 04:50.856
Through her temporal lobe.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.824
Ducky...

04:52.826 --> 04:55.360
Meanwhile, director
david is in here

04:55.362 --> 04:57.429
While I await further
instructions.

04:57.431 --> 05:00.332
I asked if you're all right.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.434
Some days are
better than others.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.535
What about you?

05:03.537 --> 05:06.071
What's his story?
Our shooter?

05:06.073 --> 05:08.940
Suicide by cyanide.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.443
A three-word
nursery rhyme.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.812
And a popular means of
escape throughout history

05:13.814 --> 05:18.083
For cowards...
Goring, himmler, goebbels.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.751
Still no
identification.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.621
Mcgee's not
having much luck.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.389
Maybe medical
records could help.

05:24.391 --> 05:28.093
As it seems that cyanide was
only expediting the inevitable.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.864
What's that?
His liver.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.434
Riddled with inoperable tumors.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.703
Doesn't appear to have
been under treatment.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.104
I would have given
him six months.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.906
Made killing himself easier?

05:40.908 --> 05:43.575
Pity does not
validate cowardice.

05:53.886 --> 05:55.821
You shouldn't
be here today, leon.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.390
I appreciate the concern,
mr. Secretary,

05:58.392 --> 05:59.858
But I needed a word,

05:59.860 --> 06:01.960
And also wanted to grab
a few things from...

06:04.464 --> 06:05.731
...My desk.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.800
Oh, leon. Hey, I'm...
I was just, uh...

06:10.136 --> 06:13.905
I... I'm so sorry.

06:13.907 --> 06:14.973
Mr. Secretary.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.475
Deputy director craig.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.043
Aren't you supposed
to be in geneva?

06:18.045 --> 06:19.945
Uh, brussels.
International crime conference.

06:19.947 --> 06:20.946
Geneva was last month.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.147
I got the first
flight out

06:22.149 --> 06:23.515
As soon as I got the news.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.851
What's this?

06:25.853 --> 06:27.686
Uh, uh, belgian chocolates.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.788
Uh, oddly enough, I was,
uh, picking them up

06:29.790 --> 06:33.158
For mrs. Vance when
special agent gibbs called.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.795
I... It was always her
standing request that I, uh,

06:36.797 --> 06:39.998
Grab a box any time I was
anywhere near a windmill.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.534
The kids will eat them.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.669
Of course. How are...
Are the kids okay?

06:44.671 --> 06:47.038
No, jerome,
they're not okay.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.508
Not by a long shot.
No...

06:49.510 --> 06:51.009
Can you give us
a minute?

06:51.011 --> 06:52.811
Yes, sir, of course.
I'll, uh...

06:52.813 --> 06:54.946
I'll just get myself
caught up downstairs.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.516
Jerome.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.017
Thank you.

06:59.019 --> 07:02.954
Yeah.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.927
Leon, if there's
anything I can do

07:08.929 --> 07:10.996
To help you
and the kids...
I want to stay.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.864
I want to be involved, clayton.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.467
Leon...
I need to be a
part of this.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.803
The best I can offer
is to keep you in the loop.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.204
But day-to-day
responsibilities

07:19.206 --> 07:21.506
Will have to fall
to your deputy director.

07:25.211 --> 07:26.678
(sighing): God.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.013
Belgian chocolates--
what am I thinking?

07:28.015 --> 07:29.915
That poor bastard
lost his wife,

07:29.917 --> 07:32.918
I'm in there, I'm babbling
about windmills.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.219
Oh. Doesn't
make sense.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.455
Gibbs, jackie-- she always
went out of here way.

07:36.457 --> 07:37.589
She was so kind.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.491
It's like she knew
working for her husband

07:39.493 --> 07:41.726
Was... Was no cake walk.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.862
Neither is being
top dog, jerome.

07:43.864 --> 07:47.499
I know that. Look, I know
you have, uh, opinions

07:47.501 --> 07:52.904
About my, um...
My management style in the past.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.506
Who am I to judge?

07:54.508 --> 07:56.141
Rest assured, this is
an interim assignment.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.777
I have no intention
of taking leon's job.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.879
You and I, we...

08:00.881 --> 08:03.048
Deputy director craig...

08:03.050 --> 08:04.983
I've got your back.

08:06.586 --> 08:09.988
You just... You keep
your tie straight.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.790
It's not straight?
Is it...

08:11.792 --> 08:13.925
Sorry, is it...

08:13.927 --> 08:16.228
Uh, a mirror...

08:18.064 --> 08:19.231
You find ziva?

08:19.233 --> 08:20.999
Right where you said she'd be.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.501
She's home now,
taking a shower.

08:22.503 --> 08:23.969
And you let her?

08:23.971 --> 08:26.004
She does not go
back home again

08:26.006 --> 08:27.939
Until we know she's
not a target.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.908
Mcgee:
Boss, shooter's
prints took me

08:29.910 --> 08:30.976
From alias to alias,

08:30.978 --> 08:33.011
But I was finally
able to get a

08:33.013 --> 08:34.779
Positive I.D.
Through interpol.

08:34.781 --> 08:36.515
What is he? Iranian?
Palestinian?

08:36.517 --> 08:38.517
Would you
believe swedish?

08:38.519 --> 08:41.253
Roland ames, 35, an officer
with the swedish special forces

08:41.255 --> 08:43.788
Before abandoning his regiment
at the height of the iraq war.

08:43.790 --> 08:44.923
Been on the lam
ever since.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.124
Man without a country.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.226
Mcgee: Classified as
a mercenary since 2007,

08:48.228 --> 08:51.029
No apparent allegiances
beyond whoever is paying him.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.097
Wonder what
the going rate is

08:52.099 --> 08:53.231
For killing the
director of mossad.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.966
Not to mention whatever
fat bonus he got

08:54.968 --> 08:56.268
For not being
taken alive.

08:56.270 --> 08:57.903
It doesn't matter.
He was dying anyway.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.538
Ducky found cancer.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.610
A guy like that,
he wants one last score.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.946
Money doesn't
mean anything

09:07.948 --> 09:10.715
Unless you leave it behind
for someone to spend it.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.084
On it. Child, wife, mother...

09:13.086 --> 09:14.553
Find out who he
left the money to

09:14.555 --> 09:17.055
Hey, hang on,
before you start that,

09:17.057 --> 09:18.089
Help me track down

09:18.091 --> 09:20.625
Eli's iranian pal, kazmi.

09:20.627 --> 09:21.860
He's been quiet.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.262
Too quiet.
I'll try his hotel.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.031
Don't bother, no one's seen
him there all morning.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.299
Remember that bug
you gave me last year?

09:27.301 --> 09:29.034
The remote
tracking device?

09:29.036 --> 09:30.335
You actually
use that?

09:30.337 --> 09:31.803
Well, yeah.

09:31.805 --> 09:32.971
Kazmi's got a coat pocket.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.040
I'm proud of you, boss.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.008
Damn thing better work.
Of course it will.

09:37.010 --> 09:40.145
Just need to plug in
the activation codes, and...

09:41.981 --> 09:43.148
...There he is.

09:43.150 --> 09:46.885
Georgetown.
P street and 35th.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.688
Moving slow.
On foot. No car.
Pick him up now, boss?

09:49.690 --> 09:50.922
Nope, keep tracking the money.

09:50.924 --> 09:54.059
Check in with
our friends in israel.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.227
I got this.

10:02.134 --> 10:03.335
Hello, abby.

10:03.337 --> 10:05.870
Oh, my god, ziva.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.339
Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.874
I was going to leave you

10:09.876 --> 10:11.343
A message, but I...

10:11.345 --> 10:13.778
What do you say
on a voice mail

10:13.780 --> 10:16.748
Other than "I'm so sorry"
and "I'm here for you"?

10:16.750 --> 10:18.617
What are you doing here?

10:18.619 --> 10:21.186
I came to see my
father's body in autopsy.

10:21.188 --> 10:25.123
Oh... Oh, you know that's
a giant secret, right?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.659
Tony informed me.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.160
As far as the world
is concerned,

10:29.162 --> 10:34.032
And I must behave as though
nothing has happened.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.934
Sucks, right?

10:35.936 --> 10:38.336
Among other things.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.971
Now, what
is all of this?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.039
Oatmeal raisin.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.341
I can see that. Why?

10:43.343 --> 10:47.178
Well, they say that the smell
of fresh-baked... Anything

10:47.180 --> 10:50.248
Makes people relaxed
and makes them more kind.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.318
So, you know, at a time like
this, feeling like we do,

10:53.320 --> 10:55.887
I just thought cookies
can't hurt, right?

10:55.889 --> 10:57.255
Tell me about the bullets.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.090
Oh, I-I can't.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.725
No, I...

11:00.727 --> 11:03.361
There's a "too close to
the crime" list, and...

11:03.363 --> 11:06.331
You and director vance
are the only two names

11:06.333 --> 11:08.033
On it, so I...

11:08.035 --> 11:09.267
Abby, as my friend,
please tell me.

11:09.269 --> 11:12.370
There's nothing to tell.

11:12.372 --> 11:15.106
Shooter could have
gotten them anywhere.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.341
Anywhere?

11:19.078 --> 11:21.146
(siren wails in distance)

11:29.155 --> 11:31.056
We need to talk.

11:32.291 --> 11:34.159
Special agent gibbs.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.094
You are aware
that if I am seen

11:36.096 --> 11:37.162
By the wrong people

11:37.164 --> 11:40.398
Talking to a u.S.
Federal agent,

11:40.400 --> 11:42.233
It could cost me my life.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.302
That's the same
as not talking to one.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.205
(speaks farsi)

11:50.376 --> 11:52.143
Pursuing me so publicly,
agent gibbs,

11:52.145 --> 11:54.012
Could jeopardize everything

11:54.014 --> 11:56.081
Eli and I are working
to accomplish.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.783
I'm going to jeopardize
more than that.

11:58.785 --> 11:59.984
What are you doing?

11:59.986 --> 12:01.419
Where's eli david?
Have you talked to him?

12:01.421 --> 12:02.821
No.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.256
I don't know
where he is.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.158
Please, gibbs.

12:07.160 --> 12:11.096
Eli assured me
that you could be trusted.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.131
Can I trust you?

12:13.133 --> 12:16.234
What are you
not telling me, hmm?

12:18.237 --> 12:20.038
Not here.

12:23.042 --> 12:25.310
(speaks farsi)

12:25.312 --> 12:27.145
How could eli be dead?

12:27.147 --> 12:29.247
He was shot to death
last night.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.349
Director vance's wife
was caught in the cross fire.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.451
Vance's woman is dead as well?

12:33.453 --> 12:34.519
Her name was jackie.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.154
She was a mother of two.

12:36.156 --> 12:39.124
You don't think that I had
anything to do with this.

12:39.126 --> 12:42.260
I swear on my children,
I had no idea.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.229
Eli was my friend.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.231
I was the one who approached him

12:46.233 --> 12:49.334
About forging peace
to begin with.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.468
Sounds like the perfect
setup to me.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.172
Surely you know that, uh,

12:54.174 --> 12:56.274
Eli was too smart for that.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.276
You would have to be
a fool to attempt it.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.378
Not to mention a monster.

13:00.380 --> 13:04.282
You and eli were calling
each other a lot worse.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.484
I can prove my innocence.

13:08.154 --> 13:12.257
I will have vivac intelligence
sent to you, gibbs.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.359
Assassins,
weapons experts,

13:14.361 --> 13:17.028
Any relevant suspects.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.097
Eli had too many enemies.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.932
Just like you.
Yes.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.268
And they brought us together.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.971
In which case it is possible
that I could be next.

13:28.374 --> 13:31.876
Well, maybe I should
let you walk.

13:31.878 --> 13:33.344
Do the whole world a favor.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.814
You have to trust me.

13:35.816 --> 13:36.981
The hell I do.

13:36.983 --> 13:40.018
What other choice do you have?

13:45.591 --> 13:46.991
Where is she, mcgee?

13:46.993 --> 13:48.526
You said you had her
on the line.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.061
Hang on,
I had some interference

13:50.063 --> 13:51.329
From israel.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.597
How is that, timmy?

13:52.599 --> 13:54.098
Can you see me?

13:54.100 --> 13:55.200
Yeah, gabi, much better.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.202
So lovely to hear from you.

13:57.204 --> 13:59.504
Lovely to see you,
too, gavriela.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.039
Looking, uh...

14:01.041 --> 14:04.375
Looking stunning,
as always.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.277
Oh, hello,
special agent dinozzo.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.048
So, he's timmy

14:10.050 --> 14:12.250
And I'm special agent
dinozzo?

14:12.252 --> 14:14.085
Since when?
Gabi, we need
your help.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.553
You still have friends
at the cia?

14:15.555 --> 14:16.988
I have friends everywhere.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.556
None like you, timmy.

14:19.558 --> 14:22.527
Uh, sorry,
third wheel here.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.496
Just wondering
if any of your cia buds

14:25.498 --> 14:28.066
Have seen
eli david recently.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.601
Mossad director david?

14:29.603 --> 14:31.536
Not in jerusalem.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.238
Rumor has it
he was taking a trip

14:33.240 --> 14:34.239
To visit his daughter.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.341
That's news to us.

14:36.343 --> 14:39.477
He'd be coming over here
for a different reason?

14:39.479 --> 14:41.312
Like any particular threat

14:41.314 --> 14:42.247
That he might be under?

14:42.249 --> 14:43.982
Well, he's always under threat.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.216
Though the first wave group

14:45.218 --> 14:46.985
Has been making
the most noise these days.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.286
First wave?

14:48.288 --> 14:50.154
I'm guessing
that isn't the shampoo

14:50.156 --> 14:52.257
That keeps your hair so lovely.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.225
No, it is
a pro-palestinian organization

14:54.227 --> 14:56.160
Out to shut down
mossad in general,

14:56.162 --> 14:58.630
And eli in particular,
for years.

14:58.632 --> 15:02.033
It's funded by an american
billionaire named gustafson.

15:02.035 --> 15:05.637
Well, that's got a
swedish ring to it.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.272
So help me, mcblivious,

15:07.274 --> 15:09.173
If you don't pounce on
that hot israeli action,

15:09.175 --> 15:10.541
I will never forgive you.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.443
Gabi's a spy, tony.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.913
Flirting's just another
weapon in her arsenal.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.180
And what an arsenal.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.383
Huh?
(chuckles)

15:18.385 --> 15:19.984
That wasn't just
flirting, tim.

15:19.986 --> 15:22.453
That was... <i>Flirting.</i>

15:22.455 --> 15:24.389
And for whatever reason,
she's caught the mcfever

15:24.391 --> 15:25.690
And you're the only cure.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.558
Cure for what?
For what ails us, boss.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.927
Just checking a lead

15:28.929 --> 15:31.329
From our mole in jerusalem.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.664
Did you get anything
out of kazmi?

15:32.666 --> 15:35.566
Finally heard back
from the consulate in stockholm.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.567
Shooter's family?

15:36.569 --> 15:39.070
Ames has an ex-wife and a son

15:39.072 --> 15:40.505
Living in a town
called visby.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.373
Personal account
shows a wire transfer

15:42.375 --> 15:44.375
Of 20 million
swedish krona

15:44.377 --> 15:46.144
Not three hours
after the shooting.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.512
20 million. A lot of krona.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.980
Just over three million u.S.

15:48.982 --> 15:52.050
Yeah, I'm still working
on that part.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.051
Well, could be this guy.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.185
Duane gustafson.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.188
52, heir to a texas
oil fortune

15:57.190 --> 15:58.957
With a buttload
of middle eastern ties.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.291
According to gavriela,

16:00.293 --> 16:02.193
He finances an anti-mossad
group in palestine.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.228
Gavriela's good looking.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.064
His, uh, e-mail auto-reply
says he's in d.C.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.398
Meeting with lobbyists.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.367
She likes mcgee.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.002
Go get him.

16:19.611 --> 16:21.612
Man:
Why don't we cut to the chase?

16:21.614 --> 16:23.047
Tony:
Let's do that, mr. Gustafson.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.248
First wave group.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.316
Our intel says

16:25.318 --> 16:26.718
They've made
multiple threats

16:26.720 --> 16:29.287
To mossad director eli david.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.389
Well, maybe you should ask them.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.291
Tony:
Well, see, that's
the funny thing.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.259
Our intel says you are them.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.328
Bit of an overstatement.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.696
Being a loyal contributor

16:38.698 --> 16:40.331
Does not make me
chairman of the board.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.466
No.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.368
Being theonly
contributor might.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.435
Let's cut the bull.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.670
Please.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.372
Do I have business ties
in the middle east?

16:47.374 --> 16:49.107
Clearly.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.009
And would those ties
be a lot tighter

16:51.011 --> 16:52.443
Without the eli davids
of the world

16:52.445 --> 16:54.612
Standing in the way of progress?

16:54.614 --> 16:57.648
I'm sure you know
that answer as well.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.284
Which entitles you
to sanction threats

17:00.286 --> 17:01.619
And finance violent acts?

17:01.621 --> 17:03.488
Never. Understand,

17:03.490 --> 17:05.156
My feelings about israel

17:05.158 --> 17:06.524
Are far from political

17:06.526 --> 17:07.558
And hardly personal.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.793
It's strictly business.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.428
Hell, my own attorney's a jew.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.030
And I think

17:12.032 --> 17:15.066
It might just be time
to give him a call.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.038
Don't let me interrupt,
agent dinozzo.
Who's this guy?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.172
I just want to ask
mr. Gustafson

17:21.174 --> 17:22.707
What his feelings are
on the subject

17:22.709 --> 17:24.075
Of collateral damage.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.343
Director.
Like how he would feel

17:25.345 --> 17:27.311
If his hatred for one person

17:27.313 --> 17:29.747
Should inadvertently
spill over onto another.

17:31.350 --> 17:32.717
A completely innocent person.
Am I supposed

17:32.719 --> 17:34.485
To know what the hell
he's talking about?

17:34.487 --> 17:36.788
Craig:
Director vance...

17:36.790 --> 17:39.190
I need your help
with something right away.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.558
Craig:
Please.

17:50.302 --> 17:53.438
Make your phone call.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.476
You know, it's
all right, leon.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.144
It's perfectly
understandable.

18:00.146 --> 18:01.646
No.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.715
No, it's not.
Hey.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.185
Let's move it down
to this end of the hall.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.123
Craig:
Director vance...

18:12.125 --> 18:14.392
Per secretary jarvis,
I'm afraid I have

18:14.394 --> 18:16.194
To ask you to take
administrative leave

18:16.196 --> 18:17.595
Until further notice.

18:19.364 --> 18:22.667
Agents will escort you
back to your hotel.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.522
I can always
open the drawer

18:44.524 --> 18:47.391
So you can actually
see your father.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.496
No need, ducky;
this is close enough.

18:51.498 --> 18:54.332
Farewells are always difficult,
closure even more so,

18:54.334 --> 18:57.502
But if you ever have
a change of heart,

18:57.504 --> 19:00.538
My door is always
open for you.

19:00.540 --> 19:03.741
What I need is for him
to be released for burial

19:03.743 --> 19:05.776
As soon as possible.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.146
Yes, I'm well aware of
the jewish tradition.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.480
But you are taking

19:09.482 --> 19:10.848
Your father's remains
back to israel

19:10.850 --> 19:13.918
While he is subject of an
active, albeit secret,

19:13.920 --> 19:16.354
Murder investigation.

19:18.490 --> 19:22.426
Which... Doesn't matter
a bit, does it?

19:25.564 --> 19:27.899
I'll do my best
for you, ziva.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.603
(elevator door opens)

19:33.572 --> 19:35.573
Ziva, go.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.475
Go where, gibbs?
Tony:
My place.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.577
I have my own place, thank you.
Gibbs: And you
can't be in it,

19:39.579 --> 19:42.413
Or here, until we find
out who did this.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.548
You know I can help.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.349
And you know my answer.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.818
Ducky:
He's right, ziva--
this is no place for you.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.587
It's a time for mourning.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.622
People who love
and admire you

19:51.624 --> 19:52.957
Have matters well in hand.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.293
I have matters in hand, ducky.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.195
Look at me. I'm fine.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.630
Then go be fine,
just not here.

20:03.969 --> 20:05.503
All right, here we here.

20:05.505 --> 20:08.973
If you want to make a list,
I can swing by your place,

20:08.975 --> 20:13.377
Pick up what you need
for the next few days.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.346
I will not be here
a few days.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.481
(sirens blaring in distance)

20:17.483 --> 20:19.517
Well, it's
not that bad.

20:19.519 --> 20:22.453
Best movie collection in town.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.256
Killer takeout
down the street.

20:26.592 --> 20:28.859
And you need to talk, ziva.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.529
(sighs)

20:31.531 --> 20:33.264
Open up a little bit.

20:34.399 --> 20:37.568
Tony, I'm going to bury
my father in israel,

20:37.570 --> 20:40.438
So I will not
be here a few days.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.939
Well... (sighs)

20:41.941 --> 20:44.775
You can sleep...
In my bed,

20:44.777 --> 20:47.845
And, uh, I've borrowed
the inflatable mattress

20:47.847 --> 20:50.748
From the woman across the
hall who had the... With...

20:50.750 --> 20:51.882
Never mind.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.384
What about the couch?

20:53.386 --> 20:55.519
Ah, someone else
is sleeping there tonight.

20:55.521 --> 20:57.755
There's my ziva.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.424
Shmeil?

21:00.426 --> 21:01.592
Oh.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.628
Oh!

21:03.630 --> 21:05.329
He was in new york.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.565
I thought you might
like to see him.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.634
(laughs quietly)

21:09.636 --> 21:11.669
(whispers):
Thank you, tony.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.540
It's really quiet
up here.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.276
Are you working
through the night?

21:18.278 --> 21:21.612
Any word on that
gustafson fellow?
Lawyered up.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.282
It's not in the clear,
but gibbs' gut isn't feeling it.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.750
Neither is mine,
for that matter.

21:25.752 --> 21:28.619
Where is ziva david?

21:28.621 --> 21:31.055
And you are...?

21:31.057 --> 21:33.357
Ilan bodnar.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.359
Mossad deputy director.
I have reason to believe

21:35.361 --> 21:37.962
That director eli david has
come here to see his daughter.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.664
Well, I'm afraid
she's not here right now.

21:39.666 --> 21:42.667
Yes. I've been blessed
with the gift of sight.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.802
What I want
is answers.

21:44.804 --> 21:45.903
Take a number.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.872
Excuse me?

21:47.874 --> 21:50.574
And whose grandfather
would you be?

21:50.576 --> 21:51.642
Well, that depends.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.044
Who's your grandmother?

21:54.012 --> 21:56.414
Where is the man in charge?

22:03.055 --> 22:04.689
You got him.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.457
Special agent tim mcgee.

22:06.459 --> 22:09.527
And if you want answers,
you might just have to wait.

22:09.529 --> 22:10.728
I disagree.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.697
See, the man in charge
I'm looking for

22:12.699 --> 22:13.998
Is your secretary of navy,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.734
As I am here at
his invitation.

22:16.736 --> 22:19.937
Now, either you call him,
or I will.

22:25.043 --> 22:27.578
Call gibbs now.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.362
(sighs)

22:45.864 --> 22:47.598
(smacks lips, sighs)

22:47.600 --> 22:49.667
(distant whimpering)

22:51.503 --> 22:53.571
(quiet whimpering)

23:01.613 --> 23:03.681
(whimpering continues)

23:05.617 --> 23:07.852
(quietly):
Ziva?

23:07.854 --> 23:10.421
Ziva?
Stop!

23:10.423 --> 23:11.655
(gasps)

23:11.657 --> 23:13.824
(sighs)

23:13.826 --> 23:15.626
It's okay.
It's just a bad dream.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.528
No, it's not.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.029
(sighs)

23:19.031 --> 23:20.631
(sighs)

23:20.633 --> 23:22.633
Hey, come on.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.468
(sighs)

23:26.972 --> 23:28.973
Leave me alone, tony.

23:28.975 --> 23:32.710
(panting)

23:32.712 --> 23:34.712
I'm fine.

23:34.714 --> 23:37.081
Really.

23:42.621 --> 23:44.688
(door closes)

23:47.692 --> 23:50.494
Craig:
And to compound the tragedy,
one of our own was killed,

23:50.496 --> 23:53.831
As well-- the wife
of ncis director leon vance.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.666
Jackie...

23:55.668 --> 23:58.502
Was a dear friend.

24:00.672 --> 24:03.474
And eli david
was mydear friend.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.476
My leader and my mentor.

24:05.478 --> 24:08.779
Surely, the palestinians
or iranians are behind this.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.448
Possibly.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.650
Well, my agency
will never simply stand by

24:12.652 --> 24:14.952
And wait for your people
to do our job.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.854
Actually,
you don't have much of a choice.

24:16.856 --> 24:19.790
Craig:
Secretary jarvis has just
spoken to our president

24:19.792 --> 24:22.593
And to your prime minister.

24:22.595 --> 24:24.728
In the best interest
of avoiding conflict,

24:24.730 --> 24:27.665
The israeli government
has agreed to let ncis...

24:27.667 --> 24:29.667
Handle the investigation.

24:29.669 --> 24:30.901
Preposterous.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.203
The only provision

24:32.205 --> 24:34.205
Is, you get to prosecute

24:34.207 --> 24:36.140
After we've caught them.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.808
Gibbs:
Bodnar,

24:37.810 --> 24:39.176
It's a bitter pill,

24:39.178 --> 24:41.779
But we want these guys
as much as you do.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.848
Well...

24:46.151 --> 24:49.787
You do what you must,
and we will do what we must.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.856
What exactly does that mean?

24:51.858 --> 24:53.791
Eli david may have died
on american soil,

24:53.793 --> 24:56.193
But the blood in his veins
pumped through a heart

24:56.195 --> 24:57.695
That belonged to israel.

25:02.067 --> 25:04.134
I make no promises.

25:11.877 --> 25:13.944
Thank you both.
Thank you very much.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.212
I'll see you
tomorrow.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.914
Come on, guys.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.983
(church bells play tune)

25:21.720 --> 25:23.721
You guys,

25:23.723 --> 25:26.056
Wait by the car. I'll be there
in just a minute, okay?

25:30.629 --> 25:31.762
How you holding up?

25:31.764 --> 25:34.098
Well, the kids
want answers, gibbs.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.166
I can't give them any.

25:36.168 --> 25:39.169
All they know
is what the news is saying.

25:39.171 --> 25:42.039
That their mother was killed
by an intruder.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.808
Details won't make it
any easier, leon.

25:44.810 --> 25:46.911
News can't know about eli.

25:46.913 --> 25:49.847
It's just a matter of time
before word leaks out,

25:49.849 --> 25:51.615
If it hasn't already.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.985
Not that you would tell me.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.587
Nothing totell.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.222
Not yet.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.724
You know, this whole ordeal
has made me realize something

26:00.726 --> 26:02.092
That I didn't expect.

26:03.662 --> 26:06.864
It's helped me better understand
yourchoices.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.767
Always thought
I had a sense

26:09.769 --> 26:11.635
Of how you felt
at the time, gibbs.

26:14.005 --> 26:16.173
Now I realize I wasn't close.

26:18.843 --> 26:21.679
I've never wanted that kind
of justice before.

26:21.681 --> 26:25.049
But since the other night, hell,
that's all I think about.

26:26.851 --> 26:29.053
Was it worth it, gibbs?

26:30.689 --> 26:32.756
It had to be some relief.

26:45.337 --> 26:47.237
Do me a favor, gibbs.

26:47.239 --> 26:50.074
Get these bastards.

26:55.013 --> 26:57.047
Jackie...

26:57.049 --> 27:00.017
Wouldn't have wanted war
breaking out over this, either.

27:01.987 --> 27:04.021
And if we let that happen,
she dies in vain.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.090
She won't.

27:11.763 --> 27:12.930
(keyboard keys clicking rapidly)

27:12.932 --> 27:14.898
I don't know why
I keep checking.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.334
It's not like
anyone's gonna abduct shmeil

27:17.336 --> 27:19.403
Between here
and the corner deli.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.841
Solitaire?

27:23.843 --> 27:25.643
None of your business.

27:27.379 --> 27:29.380
Oh, I think it is.

27:29.382 --> 27:31.715
It's my apartment.

27:32.684 --> 27:34.685
My computer.

27:34.687 --> 27:36.954
Ziva...

27:36.956 --> 27:39.089
It's my job to protect you.

27:39.091 --> 27:41.291
Who are you e-mailing?
Old friends.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.193
In israel?
They do not know
about my father.

27:43.195 --> 27:44.995
That's for the best.
But apparently,

27:44.997 --> 27:49.099
Ilan bodnar, is in
washington looking for me.

27:49.101 --> 27:50.934
Does he know what happened?

27:50.936 --> 27:52.069
He does now.

27:52.071 --> 27:54.171
And you did not think
to tell me?

27:54.173 --> 27:55.706
I thought...

27:55.708 --> 27:57.708
Ziva.

27:57.710 --> 28:00.878
I think a lot of stuff...
All the time.

28:02.814 --> 28:04.915
I've been thinking
how to keep you away

28:04.917 --> 28:07.017
From all of this,
but clearly, that's not working.

28:07.019 --> 28:10.921
I have known ilan
since we were children.

28:10.923 --> 28:13.057
He always fancied
himself a... A son to eli,

28:13.059 --> 28:14.992
A part of my family,
which he is not.

28:14.994 --> 28:16.226
I am blood.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.729
And I am not allowed
the same access?

28:18.731 --> 28:21.398
What do you want me to say,
ziva? The guy's mossad.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.933
Iwas mossad.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.468
And now you're the daughter
of a dead man.

28:27.972 --> 28:30.074
Why don't you let yourself act
like one?

28:39.417 --> 28:41.985
Mcgee, what do you got?

28:41.987 --> 28:43.921
Still tracking the source
of the shooter's payment,

28:43.923 --> 28:45.489
But we've got something
on the bullets.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.424
Turns out they're russian.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.326
Oh, so now it's the russians?
Abby:
Well, by way of sweden.

28:49.328 --> 28:52.129
So it's like borscht
and meatballs.

28:52.131 --> 28:53.897
These particular russian slugs
were taken

28:53.899 --> 28:56.500
From a batch seized
by swedish police last year.

28:56.502 --> 28:59.369
They pulled in everything
but the smuggler-- omeed abbasi.

28:59.371 --> 29:01.138
He's an iranian national,

29:01.140 --> 29:03.307
And one of the region's
most prolific arms dealers.

29:03.309 --> 29:05.976
Iranian?
Abby:
Yeah.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.078
Not fans of mossad.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.848
Oh, by the way, gibbs,
you would have been so proud

29:10.850 --> 29:13.050
To see mcgee take on
that chesty bodnar character.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.485
And ducky, too.

29:14.487 --> 29:16.854
They were total badasses.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.455
It was nothing, boss. I just...
That file of iranian

29:18.457 --> 29:21.425
Intel we got from kazmi--
is this guy in there?
Hmm.

29:24.162 --> 29:25.763
There's not a mention
of him anywhere.

29:25.765 --> 29:27.765
Then why bother
calling it intel?

29:31.136 --> 29:33.003
Of course I know this man.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.272
Or I should say,
I know ofhim.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.541
He has been alluding
capture for years.

29:37.543 --> 29:40.310
Yeah, well, I got a little
tip for you, kazmi.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.246
Try putting him
in your database.

29:42.248 --> 29:45.315
What do you mean?
You said you'd give me

29:45.317 --> 29:47.518
Everybody in your vivac file,

29:47.520 --> 29:51.155
And somehow this omeed
guy isn't in there.

29:51.157 --> 29:53.090
How is that possible?

29:53.092 --> 29:55.259
I-I'm sure
it's just an oversight,

29:55.261 --> 29:56.860
Or-or a clerical error.

29:56.862 --> 29:58.128
You get my problem here?

29:58.130 --> 30:01.431
Eli david is dead,
and the only link

30:01.433 --> 30:04.134
To the bullets that
killed him is this iranian.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.271
And naturally, all iranians know
each other like brothers.

30:07.273 --> 30:08.372
Hey, you asked me to trust you!

30:08.374 --> 30:10.174
And I'm asking you again.

30:10.176 --> 30:12.209
I plead with you, gibbs.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.912
Let me look into this.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.914
Why would I take his name out?

30:16.916 --> 30:19.583
This creature
is my enemy.

30:19.585 --> 30:23.287
He has as much motive
to kill me as to kill eli david.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.823
Peace between nations

30:25.825 --> 30:28.892
Is bad for the weapons trade.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.861
Is it not?

30:32.564 --> 30:34.932
Stay here.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.306
Are you buying this?

30:42.308 --> 30:43.607
You're not?

30:43.609 --> 30:45.976
Convince me.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.077
(sighs)

30:47.079 --> 30:48.378
Well, not having omeed's name

30:48.380 --> 30:50.047
In the intel is clearly damning.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.315
Looks like an iranian cover-up.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.350
I know you think
I'm naive, but...

30:53.352 --> 30:55.152
I take kazmi at his word.

30:55.154 --> 30:57.588
I just don't think
he's behind this.

30:58.990 --> 31:00.991
Me, neither.

31:00.993 --> 31:03.160
Ah.

31:03.162 --> 31:06.930
Boss, we're about
to have company.

31:14.205 --> 31:15.272
The great gibbs.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.875
You disappoint me.

31:17.877 --> 31:22.112
I was expecting more from a man
with such reputed integrity.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.348
I wish I could say the same
about you, bodnar.

31:24.350 --> 31:27.384
You lied to me--
both of you--

31:27.386 --> 31:29.519
About the real reason
for eli's visit.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.355
Tricked

31:31.357 --> 31:33.957
By that dog kazmi to believe
in some ridiculous pipe dream

31:33.959 --> 31:35.959
Of peace between our countries?

31:35.961 --> 31:37.661
Maybe he didn't find it
so ridiculous.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.897
So you admit knowing

31:39.899 --> 31:42.199
About this alleged détente
between enemies?

31:42.201 --> 31:45.302
We don't discuss investigations
with outsiders.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.037
I am not an outsider.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.205
Now, your-your people--

31:48.207 --> 31:49.640
They don't know kazmi
as well as I do.

31:49.642 --> 31:51.675
He cannot be trusted.

31:51.677 --> 31:53.677
Kazmi's being questioned
like any other suspect.

31:53.679 --> 31:56.513
He's here? In custody?

31:56.515 --> 31:58.315
I'm calling
secretary jarvis.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.083
Don't bother.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.219
I'm calling
my prime minister

32:02.221 --> 32:04.454
And reporting that you have been
harboring eli's killer.

32:04.456 --> 32:07.224
And if the result
of that is war,

32:07.226 --> 32:10.961
Well, then, that will be
your fault, not ours.

32:20.371 --> 32:23.040
(phone beeps off,
car horn honking)

32:23.042 --> 32:25.075
(computer beeping)

32:36.688 --> 32:39.056
Hello, ziva.
Ilan.

32:39.058 --> 32:42.459
I heard you were here.
H-how did you find me?

32:42.461 --> 32:44.628
We both learned things
from your father.

32:44.630 --> 32:45.996
We are mossad.

32:45.998 --> 32:46.964
Speak for yourself.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.465
I need to see you, ziva.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.667
Mourn the loss of a great man.

32:50.669 --> 32:52.669
I loved him like a father.

32:52.671 --> 32:56.239
Mine was always too busy
to spend time, but not yours.

32:56.241 --> 32:57.407
Never eli.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.276
He was, um...

32:59.278 --> 33:01.011
He was fond of you.

33:01.013 --> 33:02.179
And of you.

33:02.181 --> 33:03.981
He was so proud, always boasting

33:03.983 --> 33:05.716
About his american daughter.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.654
We should meet.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.389
Talk face-to-face.

33:13.358 --> 33:15.625
There are rules.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.694
I cannot.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.429
Your father is dead.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.231
You shouldn't bear this alone.

33:24.202 --> 33:26.269
Come on, don't make me find you.

33:26.271 --> 33:28.505
You know I can and will.

33:32.110 --> 33:34.177
(speaking farsi)

33:37.582 --> 33:38.749
My assistant,

33:38.751 --> 33:40.751
Maya, a woman

33:40.753 --> 33:42.352
I trust
with my life,

33:42.354 --> 33:46.323
Assures me that omeed's name
is in our database.

33:46.325 --> 33:47.758
Just not in the one she sent us.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.526
But there was
a time lapse, gibbs.

33:49.528 --> 33:50.727
Maya sent the file

33:50.729 --> 33:52.796
From our office in alborz,

33:52.798 --> 33:56.400
But the receipt marking
its arrival did not come

33:56.402 --> 33:58.268
For nearly six hours later.

33:58.270 --> 34:01.471
So... Y-you think
it was intercepted.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.473
Six hours, deputy director.

34:03.475 --> 34:06.176
That's director... Now.

34:06.178 --> 34:07.244
Have you ever
been hacked before?

34:08.679 --> 34:10.180
Twice.

34:10.182 --> 34:13.050
And you?
Never.

34:13.052 --> 34:15.452
Uh, to my knowledge.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.487
I am merely saying
it is possible.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.689
Ilan bodnar tells me
you can't be trusted.

34:20.658 --> 34:22.793
As he would tell anyone.

34:22.795 --> 34:25.395
(chuckles)
eli's young protégé.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.531
Arrogant and ill-tempered.

34:27.533 --> 34:31.601
Eli could teach him nothing but
to be suspicious of everyone.

34:31.603 --> 34:34.104
Trained by the best.
(phone rings)

34:35.073 --> 34:37.607
Yeah, mcgee. Talk to me.

34:37.609 --> 34:39.276
Mcgee:
Boss, I'm getting close
on the money trail.

34:39.278 --> 34:41.778
How close?
Wire transfer
to the shooter's ex-wife

34:41.780 --> 34:43.847
Was handled by a bank
in the caymans.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.382
First security
of west bay.

34:45.384 --> 34:48.418
Mcgee: From there,
35 million in swedish krona

34:48.420 --> 34:50.253
Was wired
from a secure family trust.

34:50.255 --> 34:52.322
Name of the family.
Not sure if it's a family,

34:52.324 --> 34:53.790
But the account
is labeled "virtue."

34:57.128 --> 34:58.528
Get ziva on the phone.

34:58.530 --> 34:59.729
(beep)

34:59.731 --> 35:01.765
What is it, tony?

35:01.767 --> 35:03.800
Ziva, does the word "virtue"
mean anything to you?

35:03.802 --> 35:05.202
Um, of course, gibbs.

35:05.204 --> 35:06.736
If you mean by definition.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.872
No. No, more like a name.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.807
Um, family business?
Someone's company?

35:10.809 --> 35:11.842
Mcgee:
Ziva, it's the account

35:11.844 --> 35:14.711
Mean anything
in another language?

35:14.713 --> 35:18.448
In farsi, the word
for "virtue" is <i>"taqwa."</i>

35:18.450 --> 35:20.117
Means nothing to me.

35:20.119 --> 35:23.153
I know it's not russian.
What about hebrew? Arabic?

35:27.158 --> 35:29.626
In hebrew...

35:29.628 --> 35:32.295
(sighs)
yes, in hebrew
the word is <i>"tohar."</i>

35:32.297 --> 35:34.197
Connection?
A man's middle name.

35:34.199 --> 35:36.233
Whose?
Ilan bodnar.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.400
He's on his way here.

35:37.402 --> 35:39.569
My apartment?
I'm armed.

35:39.571 --> 35:41.338
Dinozzo, you're with me.

35:41.340 --> 35:43.573
Mcgee, get to bodnar's
hotel with backup.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.408
Go. Now.
Tony:
Ziva, there's a gun taped

35:45.410 --> 35:47.177
To the back of my
toiletgodfather-style.

35:47.179 --> 35:48.545
Use it.

35:50.348 --> 35:53.517
(horns honking in distance)

35:58.489 --> 36:00.857
(sighs)
you should have knocked.

36:00.859 --> 36:02.859
I live here.
Yeah, and you almost
died here, too.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.861
Where's bodnar?
He never showed.

36:04.863 --> 36:07.898
Check with mcgee.
All right.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.168
Hey.

36:11.170 --> 36:13.170
You all right?

36:13.172 --> 36:16.506
I-I don't know what
I am right now.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.175
My father trusted ilan.

36:18.177 --> 36:20.677
Rule number eight:
Never take anything for granted.

36:20.679 --> 36:21.945
Tony:
Hold on a second.

36:21.947 --> 36:25.182
Mcgee says his hotel room's
scrubbed clean.

36:25.184 --> 36:29.619
He could be watching us
right now.

36:29.621 --> 36:32.255
Jarvis:
<i>Mossad claims</i>
<i>bodnar acted alone.</i>

36:32.257 --> 36:34.758
The israelis are as anxious
to find him as we are.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.826
He hired the hit man,
but when ames took himself out,

36:36.828 --> 36:37.861
Bodnar finished
the job himself.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.497
Pin it on you, take out ziva...

36:40.499 --> 36:41.965
Take over as director of mossad.

36:43.801 --> 36:47.304
We always knew that our meeting
would be dangerous.

36:47.306 --> 36:48.838
One can only
hope that

36:48.840 --> 36:52.576
Eli david will be remembered
for dying in the name of peace.

36:53.778 --> 36:54.911
We have a car waiting

36:54.913 --> 36:56.913
To take you to the airport.
No need.

36:56.915 --> 36:58.982
I will find my way.

36:58.984 --> 37:00.684
I always do.

37:02.453 --> 37:04.387
Gibbs:
Kazmi.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.623
It's brave what
you and eli tried to do.

37:06.625 --> 37:09.993
Our worlds are different, gibbs;

37:09.995 --> 37:12.295
Our goals...

37:12.297 --> 37:15.298
The same.

37:22.473 --> 37:25.242
(speaking farsi)

37:26.577 --> 37:28.645
I'll be home soon.

38:16.061 --> 38:18.762
I told his escorts
he doesn't like peanuts,

38:18.764 --> 38:21.331
So they gave him
pretzels instead.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.366
Go with him, shmeil.

38:23.368 --> 38:25.068

38:40.885 --> 38:42.986
You did not have to come.
