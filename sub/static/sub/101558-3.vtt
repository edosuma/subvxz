13:44.833 --> 13:46.875
It's just for one night.
She's already fast asleep.

13:46.958 --> 13:47.916
It's better I'm here.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.500
-Just in case you-know-who shows up.
-That would be great.

13:50.583 --> 13:52.875
You haven't touched your hot chocolate,
Mrs. Grose.

13:53.916 --> 13:54.875
Can I have it?

13:54.958 --> 13:57.333
-Uh, no, you'll be up all night.
-[Flora] Yes!

13:57.416 --> 13:59.208
-Let's stay up all night!
-[Dani] Flora.

13:59.291 --> 14:01.041
[Flora] This is all so exciting!

14:01.125 --> 14:04.166
We're going to stay up all night long,
and it's going to be perfectly--

14:04.250 --> 14:05.458
[fire crackling]

14:13.916 --> 14:16.583
What on earth would possess him
to show his face around here again?

14:16.666 --> 14:18.750
It can't be for more money, surely.

14:18.833 --> 14:20.666
He can't have got through
what he stole already.

14:20.750 --> 14:22.041
Oh, no, thanks, love.

14:22.791 --> 14:25.416
One of us needs to be sober enough
to take him on.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.000
You want the poker or the shotgun?

14:27.083 --> 14:29.166
Mm. Candlestick in the library.

14:29.250 --> 14:30.291
[Owen sighs]

14:31.125 --> 14:31.958
Here you go.

14:32.083 --> 14:35.125
[Owen] What if he's the one
who's been ringing here…

14:35.583 --> 14:36.916
then hanging up? Hm?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.791
I thought those were prank calls.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.791
Well, maybe not.

14:42.375 --> 14:43.833
Who would he be trying to call?

14:44.875 --> 14:45.750
Maybe Becca.

14:46.750 --> 14:50.333
-Why would he call a dead woman?
-He might not know she's dead. [sighs]

14:54.583 --> 14:57.041
She certainly wasn't big news
outside the county.

14:57.875 --> 14:59.250
He might not know a thing.

15:02.083 --> 15:04.083
Or maybe he spent all the money, or…

15:04.583 --> 15:05.875
had second thoughts.

15:07.458 --> 15:08.791
Or maybe he misses her.

15:11.250 --> 15:12.166
So…

15:12.833 --> 15:14.625
he calls the house now and then,

15:15.291 --> 15:16.875
hoping she'll pick up, which…

15:18.333 --> 15:19.375
…she never does.

15:22.666 --> 15:23.500
So…

15:25.125 --> 15:26.375
he comes on back…

15:27.125 --> 15:28.166
to find out why.

15:32.416 --> 15:34.416
Well, that doesn't bode well for anyone.

15:36.375 --> 15:37.708
I wouldn't fancy being there

15:37.791 --> 15:40.583
when Peter Quint
finds out Rebecca Jessel is dead.

15:47.458 --> 15:50.750
-[Rebecca] So, are these two friends?
-[Flora] Yeah.

15:50.833 --> 15:53.125
-They're friends.
-[Rebecca chuckles]

15:53.208 --> 15:54.708
-Best friends.
-Mm-hm.

15:55.416 --> 15:56.833
Dolls are ridiculous.

15:57.458 --> 15:59.125
Dolls are wonderful.

15:59.208 --> 16:03.416
You get to make up all kinds of people
and tell stories with them.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.208
Hello, my name is Flora.

16:06.291 --> 16:08.000
But they're not made up.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.750
I'll make one of you, Miss Jessel.

16:11.375 --> 16:12.875
What's your favorite color?

16:12.958 --> 16:14.041
Hmm.

16:14.125 --> 16:16.625
I don't have a favorite.
I like all the colors.

16:16.708 --> 16:19.416
Then I'll make you one
with all the colors.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.333
Thank you. [laughs]

16:20.458 --> 16:21.458
[knocking on door]

16:21.541 --> 16:22.375
Come in!

16:23.166 --> 16:24.000
Am I interrupting?

16:25.166 --> 16:28.125
Ah, I'm here on an errand
for Sir Henry, and…

16:29.583 --> 16:30.750
…well, I found these,

16:30.833 --> 16:34.125
and I thought flowers this beautiful
deserve a beautiful woman.

16:34.208 --> 16:35.833
So, these are for you, Flora.

16:35.916 --> 16:38.291
[gasps] Thank you so much.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.416
They're perfectly splendid.

16:42.083 --> 16:44.458
No one's ever given me flowers before.

16:44.541 --> 16:46.500
And I thought they were for Miss Jessel.

16:46.583 --> 16:48.833
And now you're so dreadfully jealous.

16:49.416 --> 16:51.833
Well, we can share, can't we, Flora?

16:51.916 --> 16:52.916
Of course.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.625
Have a flower, please.

16:55.708 --> 16:56.583
Aww.

16:56.666 --> 16:58.416
Well, thank you, Flora.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.750
Let's go and put these
in some water, okay?

17:01.833 --> 17:02.666
Be right back.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.541
You didn't rip up Jamie's garden, did you?

17:06.625 --> 17:08.500
She'll be cross if you did.

17:08.583 --> 17:10.541
Ah, that one was born cross.

17:10.625 --> 17:14.375
I don't know why Flora gets so silly
about a few stupid flowers.

17:14.458 --> 17:17.125
Do you know what life
is really all about, Miles?

17:18.708 --> 17:20.291
-Not flowers.
-No.

17:21.416 --> 17:22.416
Keys.

17:23.833 --> 17:24.666
See…

17:25.250 --> 17:27.125
people are like locked rooms.

17:27.208 --> 17:28.541
They've all got different locks,

17:28.625 --> 17:30.875
and you've got to guess the shape
of their key.

17:31.375 --> 17:34.041
Like how there are…

17:34.541 --> 17:38.791
keys to all the doors in this pointlessly,
excessively large house.

17:38.875 --> 17:41.250
Different keys for different doors.

17:41.791 --> 17:43.750
So, if you want someone to open a door,

17:44.500 --> 17:48.416
you have to try out different keys
until you find the one that works.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.750
Like…

17:50.708 --> 17:52.208
for people like your uncle…

17:52.291 --> 17:54.125
His key is money.

17:54.208 --> 17:55.375
Or flattery.

17:55.458 --> 17:56.833
For horses, it's carrots.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.000
And for women, most of them…

18:00.916 --> 18:02.166
[sighs] …it's flowers.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.750
Then why did you give the flowers
to Flora?

18:07.666 --> 18:08.833
I didn't.

18:08.916 --> 18:10.500
[thunder rumbling]

18:12.625 --> 18:14.000
[wind whistling]

18:18.500 --> 18:19.958
-Still at it?
-[Peter chuckles]

18:20.458 --> 18:22.083
-I'm just about done.
-Mm-hm.

18:23.291 --> 18:25.458
Not looking forward to going out in that.

18:26.708 --> 18:27.875
Uh, then don't.

18:28.833 --> 18:30.583
Have some tea while it blows over.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.333
Okay.

18:35.625 --> 18:37.625
[thunder rumbling]

18:39.750 --> 18:41.416
So, how are you finding it?

18:42.333 --> 18:44.166
It's a fine job, really.

18:44.666 --> 18:45.500
Uh, yes.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.333
The kids are very sweet,

18:48.416 --> 18:51.500
even if I'm mopping up
their muddy footprints sometimes.

18:51.583 --> 18:54.416
Twice now they've snuck out
in the middle of the night.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.750
No, I mean, how are you finding all this?

18:56.833 --> 18:58.666
I mean, living in a mansion,

18:58.750 --> 19:01.125
the statue gardens,
ordering servants about,

19:01.208 --> 19:02.750
this ridiculousness.

19:02.833 --> 19:03.791
I mean, I'm…

19:03.875 --> 19:05.625
hardly lady of the manor.

19:06.208 --> 19:09.833
Uh, I spent the morning
cleaning vomit off the boy's jumper.

19:10.875 --> 19:11.916
[giggles]

19:12.458 --> 19:13.875
I'm sorry, that's not funny.

19:17.208 --> 19:19.208
One like you, as smart as you are.

19:20.958 --> 19:22.291
Well, it's offensive even.

19:23.083 --> 19:24.541
It's fine.

19:24.625 --> 19:26.791
Um, Miles is a sweetheart.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.750
Surely, that's not what you wanted.

19:34.375 --> 19:38.041
I mean, I can't imagine
a young Rebecca Jessel

19:38.125 --> 19:41.583
looking out her window,
dreaming up at the sky that someday,

19:42.291 --> 19:45.791
someday, she'd be scrubbing up
some rich kid's puke

19:45.875 --> 19:48.208
while his guardian drinks himself
into a coma.

19:49.333 --> 19:50.583
You're too good for that.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.625
Too good.

19:52.708 --> 19:54.125
And too smart.

19:56.125 --> 19:58.333
I don't care if Henry can't see it, I can.

19:58.833 --> 20:00.291
I saw it the day you walked in.

20:00.375 --> 20:03.625
I said to him,
"One day, I might be working for her."

20:04.458 --> 20:05.500
[thunder rumbling]

20:08.041 --> 20:09.166
Tell me what you want.

20:11.458 --> 20:15.291
I mean, everybody wants something in life,

20:15.375 --> 20:18.416
and somehow our betters
have convinced us that's a bad thing.

20:19.958 --> 20:22.625
So, what do you want, Rebecca?

20:24.916 --> 20:26.416
I want to be a barrister.

20:26.916 --> 20:28.291
Now you're talking.

20:28.375 --> 20:30.500
Not a solicitor.

20:30.583 --> 20:33.000
A proper barrister, like Mr. Wingrave.

20:33.083 --> 20:35.041
But, first, I need a pupilage.

20:36.166 --> 20:38.458
Three other women from my year
managed to get one,

20:38.541 --> 20:40.333
and all left within the first year.

20:42.458 --> 20:45.791
A sea of old men
trying to run a hand up your skirt

20:45.875 --> 20:47.416
every day for six months

20:47.500 --> 20:51.000
while you try to persuade them
that your brain isn't between your legs.

20:53.458 --> 20:54.833
So, you took a different route?

20:56.666 --> 20:59.291
I mean, your references,
they're impeccable.

20:59.375 --> 21:02.791
Astor's, Bryce's, Gray's of Norfolk.
People like that get to know you,

21:03.375 --> 21:07.041
see the brain power and ingenuity
just taking care of their heirs.

21:07.125 --> 21:08.000
But now…

21:09.291 --> 21:12.333
…now you have their wife or child
fetching for you.

21:12.916 --> 21:15.333
And you remain focused,
you keep on impressing…

21:16.416 --> 21:19.333
…you leap right over
all those grabbing hands

21:19.416 --> 21:21.541
and find someone of worth to mentor you.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.458
[thunder rumbling]

21:24.541 --> 21:27.875
Henry is a QC
and a master in trade legislation,

21:27.958 --> 21:30.041
but you knew that
when you applied, didn't you?

21:31.750 --> 21:33.333
I see you, Rebecca.

21:36.000 --> 21:36.833
I see you.

21:39.583 --> 21:41.833
-[thunder rumbling]
-[Rebecca sighs]

21:41.916 --> 21:43.083
So…

21:44.875 --> 21:45.791
…why are <i>you </i>here?

21:47.625 --> 21:49.375
Why am I here, uh…

21:50.041 --> 21:51.083
on this Earth?

21:52.291 --> 21:55.250
Why am I here in this job
working for Henry, or, uh…

21:56.208 --> 21:57.625
why am I here with you

21:57.708 --> 22:00.291
when I was meant
to be back in London an hour ago?

22:03.333 --> 22:04.833
Let's take them one at a time.

22:06.583 --> 22:08.166
Why am I here on this Earth?

22:08.250 --> 22:11.041
Uh, to make sure I leave behind
more than I took.

22:11.125 --> 22:13.416
Why am I here in this job
working for Henry?

22:13.500 --> 22:16.958
Because you may not know it
to look at me, but…

22:17.791 --> 22:20.791
there is a ceiling that I, too,
cannot break through.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.333
Growing up where I did,

22:24.416 --> 22:27.041
I'm quite simply not part
of the fucking club.

22:28.958 --> 22:29.958
So…

22:31.625 --> 22:32.500
…why am I here?

22:41.125 --> 22:42.000
I don't know.

22:44.375 --> 22:45.583
But I feel…

22:48.791 --> 22:49.625
…hopeful.

22:51.541 --> 22:53.625
And that doesn't happen often, not to me.

23:02.583 --> 23:05.166
I should go. I'm sorry. Uh…

23:05.833 --> 23:08.791
-Are you sure? It-- it's still--
-No, it-it's fine.

23:08.875 --> 23:09.958
The worst has passed.

23:13.375 --> 23:16.750
But thank you, uh, for the drink,
and the company.

23:17.416 --> 23:18.291
You're welcome.

23:27.416 --> 23:28.250
Thank you…

23:28.875 --> 23:30.083
for the conversation.

23:31.750 --> 23:34.458
It's been a long time
since I've had a real one.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.208
Good night, Rebecca Jessel.

23:39.541 --> 23:41.125
Good night, Peter Quint.

23:47.708 --> 23:48.625
[sighs]

23:50.666 --> 23:52.666
[eerie music playing]

23:55.125 --> 23:56.125
[jarring crescendo]

23:57.208 --> 23:58.208
[gentle music plays]

24:08.500 --> 24:09.791
Hey, you all right?

24:09.875 --> 24:10.708
Hm?

24:11.708 --> 24:13.458
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

24:14.541 --> 24:15.375
[sighs]

24:16.000 --> 24:18.291
If truth be told,
I haven't slept well for days.

24:19.416 --> 24:21.916
Well, Mrs. Grose, it is too late now.

24:22.708 --> 24:23.583
Come on.

24:24.958 --> 24:26.416
Tuck in and relax for a bit.

24:27.583 --> 24:28.750
[sighs]

24:28.833 --> 24:29.791
[chuckles]

24:29.875 --> 24:31.750
Rather that was you curled up there?

24:34.250 --> 24:35.708
[Owen clears throat]

24:36.750 --> 24:38.833
Every girl in the village is mad for him.

24:39.458 --> 24:42.208
He doesn't even know it,
which makes it even worse.

24:42.291 --> 24:43.375
[chuckles softly]

24:46.041 --> 24:48.250
[Dani] They look like Bonnie and Clyde.

24:48.333 --> 24:49.166
[Jamie] Yeah…

24:49.833 --> 24:51.500
if Clyde fucked Bonnie over.

24:53.041 --> 24:53.916
He got away.

24:54.541 --> 24:55.708
She paid the price.

24:57.166 --> 24:59.333
So, what? He's stalking a dead woman?

25:00.208 --> 25:02.833
Risking prison for someone
he didn't even bother to bring along?

25:02.916 --> 25:04.291
That doesn't make sense.

25:05.375 --> 25:07.583
The wrong kind of love can fuck you up.

25:08.666 --> 25:09.541
Follow you.

25:10.166 --> 25:13.416
Make you do some really stupid shit.

25:15.666 --> 25:18.041
[sighs heavily]

25:18.125 --> 25:19.125
And those two…

25:20.375 --> 25:23.041
…believe me,
that was the wrong kind of love.

25:23.541 --> 25:26.083
[Dani] We've all been in the wrong kind
of love for one reason or--

25:26.166 --> 25:28.750
Mm-hm. But I saw
how he twisted himself into her.

25:30.250 --> 25:31.375
Burrowed in deep.

25:33.541 --> 25:36.208
I know why so many people
mix up love and possession…

25:38.500 --> 25:39.833
But guess what that means?

25:40.958 --> 25:42.166
He didn't just trap her.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.666
He trapped himself.

25:46.458 --> 25:49.166
And I hope she haunts that fucker forever.

25:53.041 --> 25:55.041
[melancholy music playing]

25:59.708 --> 26:01.250
People do, don't they?

26:02.291 --> 26:03.833
Mix up love and possession.

26:06.333 --> 26:07.291
Yeah, they do.

26:08.250 --> 26:10.541
I don't think that should be possible.

26:10.625 --> 26:14.083
I mean, they're opposites, really.
Love and ownership.

26:18.458 --> 26:19.291
Yeah.

26:23.166 --> 26:24.916
[Hannah] They really ought to be in bed.

26:25.416 --> 26:26.458
Oh, yes.

26:26.541 --> 26:28.250
Yes, yes. [chuckles]

26:29.958 --> 26:31.250
-I'll take them.
-[Hannah] Okay.

26:33.500 --> 26:34.750
Up you go.

26:34.833 --> 26:35.666
Thank you.

26:37.125 --> 26:38.916
You're the coolest.

26:39.000 --> 26:39.875
[Jamie chuckles]

26:42.291 --> 26:44.166
-I had a bad dream.
-Oh.

26:44.250 --> 26:45.125
I hurt you.

26:45.958 --> 26:49.166
-And it made you feel sad.
-Oh, you never make me sad, poppet.

26:49.250 --> 26:50.208
[kisses]

27:07.958 --> 27:09.541
[rain pattering]

27:21.000 --> 27:22.500
[frightening orchestral swell]

27:23.208 --> 27:24.208
[Dani whimpering]

27:27.791 --> 27:31.083
[panicked breathing]

27:32.875 --> 27:34.541
[ominous music intensifying]

27:36.041 --> 27:37.541
[music abruptly stops]

27:37.625 --> 27:39.625
[rain pattering]

27:41.250 --> 27:43.250
[eerie music playing]

27:53.541 --> 27:54.791
[birds chirping]

28:01.416 --> 28:02.541
Do you have any hearts?

28:04.000 --> 28:04.916
[Flora] No.

28:05.958 --> 28:09.041
What a liar you are!
I can see two of them, right there!

28:09.125 --> 28:12.125
Stop peeking at my cards, Miles!
Miss Jessel, he's cheating!

28:12.208 --> 28:15.000
-You're lying, and that's cheating!
-It's not!

28:15.083 --> 28:17.125
[Peter] Stop cheating, Miles.

28:17.208 --> 28:18.958
[Flora giggles] Peter!

28:19.458 --> 28:20.666
What are you doing here?

28:21.750 --> 28:25.000
And, more importantly,
have you brought me any more flowers?

28:25.083 --> 28:26.541
Uh, no. Uh…

28:26.625 --> 28:28.416
I've got some errands
to do for your uncle,

28:28.500 --> 28:30.375
so he sent me here
for at least a few days.

28:30.458 --> 28:31.875
-Days? [giggles]
-That's right.

28:31.958 --> 28:34.416
Mrs. Grose is making up a room for me
as we speak.

28:35.708 --> 28:37.333
Will Uncle Henry come over soon?

28:39.000 --> 28:40.125
I don't know.

28:42.625 --> 28:43.750
What's with the face?

28:45.416 --> 28:46.666
Nothing.

28:47.583 --> 28:49.041
You know, I lost my dad too.

28:50.125 --> 28:51.500
I was a bit older than you.

28:51.583 --> 28:53.791
And he was pretty crap
most of the time, but…

28:59.791 --> 29:01.333
You've seen this, right?

29:02.833 --> 29:04.208
This belonged to my dad.

29:05.791 --> 29:07.166
It's a little piece of him.

29:08.291 --> 29:10.000
One of the only nice bits, really.

29:12.041 --> 29:12.875
Why don't you…

29:13.458 --> 29:14.541
hold on to it for me?

29:15.083 --> 29:16.083
Would you like that?

29:18.125 --> 29:20.083
Just don't burn the house down, please.

29:20.583 --> 29:21.708
[Rebecca chuckles]

29:22.750 --> 29:24.375
Let's play some cards!
[clears throat]

29:24.458 --> 29:28.041
[Flora] You just need to watch out,
because Miles is a filthy cheater.

29:28.125 --> 29:30.250
-[Peter] Is that right?
-[Flora] But otherwise…

29:31.125 --> 29:33.208
-it's perfectly splendid.
-[Peter sighs]

29:33.291 --> 29:35.833
[Miles] Yes, and you're perfectly mental.

29:35.916 --> 29:37.250
[Flora] Stop it, Miles!

29:44.583 --> 29:45.458
[sighs]

29:46.333 --> 29:47.500
[floorboard creaks]

29:57.375 --> 29:58.333
[creaking]

30:14.916 --> 30:16.958
[Peter] Sorry, I shouldn't have. Uh…

30:18.250 --> 30:19.958
I-I couldn't sleep, and, uh…

30:20.791 --> 30:21.750
[Rebecca gasps]

30:23.541 --> 30:24.625
[both moaning softly]

30:26.875 --> 30:27.791
[door locks]

31:09.666 --> 31:11.666
[praying indistinctly]

31:22.375 --> 31:23.375
[Owen] Good morning.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.166
Oh… good morning.

31:28.000 --> 31:28.916
A-Any sign of him?

31:29.666 --> 31:32.166
Oh, uh, no, not a thing.
Did a quick sweep.

31:32.250 --> 31:33.875
-Safe as houses.
-Oh.

31:33.958 --> 31:36.166
But you know what?
I think Mr. McQueeny next door

31:36.250 --> 31:37.958
could look in on Mum today.

31:38.041 --> 31:40.416
I can call him and, uh, stick around here,
just in case.

31:40.500 --> 31:43.375
No, no, really.
[inhales sharply] I'd feel just awful.

31:43.458 --> 31:44.583
Oh, it's only one day.

31:44.666 --> 31:46.791
And I'm sure she can use a day without me.

31:46.875 --> 31:49.291
It might make all the difference, really.
[chuckles]

31:50.291 --> 31:52.166
Well, thank you for coming to our rescue.

31:52.875 --> 31:54.375
Well, you always come to mine.

32:00.541 --> 32:01.583
[Owen clears throat]

32:02.375 --> 32:03.416
[footsteps receding]

32:17.791 --> 32:19.500
Good morning, it's time to wake…

32:21.875 --> 32:23.000
Oh, you're already up.

32:25.666 --> 32:26.791
How are you feeling?

32:27.291 --> 32:29.791
Capital. Wonderful, in fact.

32:29.875 --> 32:31.625
Can we have a picnic, do you think?

32:32.250 --> 32:33.708
It's a marvelous day for it.

32:34.458 --> 32:37.000
Once we find Flora,
let's make a day of it.

32:37.583 --> 32:40.125
What do you mean, find Flora?
Isn't she in her room?

32:44.833 --> 32:46.375
[music box playing "O Willow Waly"]

32:47.333 --> 32:48.166
Flora?

32:51.583 --> 32:53.916
-[music box continues playing]
-[flies buzzing]

32:56.708 --> 32:58.000
I'm all finished.

32:59.083 --> 33:01.000
And I wanted to show you something.

33:02.416 --> 33:04.166
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

33:07.208 --> 33:09.416
You said your favorite color
was all the colors,

33:09.500 --> 33:11.000
and Miles says

33:11.083 --> 33:13.625
if you mix all the colors
in the world together,

33:13.708 --> 33:14.833
you get black.

33:14.916 --> 33:17.916
Well, it's beautiful. I love it.

33:18.666 --> 33:19.833
You're beautiful.

33:20.416 --> 33:22.833
Peter was even saying so himself
this morning.

33:22.916 --> 33:25.041
He stayed the night, you know.

33:25.666 --> 33:27.791
Well, it is fun to have him here.

33:36.791 --> 33:38.875
[frightening music playing]

33:44.125 --> 33:45.333
[Dani] Flora.

33:48.166 --> 33:49.583
-Flora.
-No!

33:49.666 --> 33:50.833
-Flora!
-[screaming] No!

33:51.333 --> 33:52.500
No!

33:53.125 --> 33:55.166
No! No!

33:55.250 --> 33:58.041
-No!
-[screams fading]

34:01.333 --> 34:02.875
[music intensifying jarringly]

34:05.041 --> 34:06.625
[man] No sign of fever.

34:07.791 --> 34:09.166
Tell you what, sweetheart.

34:10.125 --> 34:12.958
You're gonna spend
the rest of the day in bed.

34:13.041 --> 34:14.583
[Dani] <i>She was inconsolable.</i>

34:15.083 --> 34:17.333
I'm afraid this isn't unprecedented.

34:17.458 --> 34:20.166
Well… not surprising
given what they've been through.

34:20.250 --> 34:21.750
[Hannah] Well, yes.

34:21.833 --> 34:25.583
Well, when you talk to Henry,
you can tell him I said they're all right.

34:26.833 --> 34:27.791
Are they all right?

34:28.375 --> 34:30.833
Well, there's nothing
physically wrong with them,

34:30.916 --> 34:33.041
and that's all I can speak to, I'm afraid.

34:33.666 --> 34:34.875
I'll see myself out.

34:36.083 --> 34:38.208
-Always nice to see you, Hannah.
-And you.

34:39.208 --> 34:40.458
[footsteps recede]

34:47.625 --> 34:49.375
I can't believe he didn't show up.

34:50.041 --> 34:52.166
I told him I'd called a goddamned doctor.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.583
He said, "Keep me posted."

34:55.083 --> 34:57.541
Tell him you called a coroner,
and then maybe.

34:57.625 --> 35:00.583
No, nothing short of that
would get Henry Wingrave back to Bly.

35:00.666 --> 35:03.166
Said the same thing when I told him
about Quint. "Keep me posted."

35:03.250 --> 35:05.208
I still don't understand, though.

35:06.166 --> 35:07.583
She was by the lake.

35:08.416 --> 35:09.750
But she hates the lake.

35:09.833 --> 35:10.666
Yeah.

35:11.666 --> 35:12.666
Miles, darling. Um…

35:12.750 --> 35:15.125
Why don't you go help Owen
with breakfast, hm?

35:15.208 --> 35:16.916
[Miles] She doesn't hate it there.

35:19.041 --> 35:20.625
Why should anyone hate a lake?

35:21.958 --> 35:23.625
She talks about it all the time.

35:25.333 --> 35:26.166
Sure.

35:26.833 --> 35:27.791
But Flora lies.

35:31.666 --> 35:32.583
[Hannah sighs]

35:48.125 --> 35:49.458
[Rebecca moans gently]

35:56.291 --> 35:57.125
[kiss]

35:57.625 --> 35:59.125
-Good morning.
-Mm.

35:59.791 --> 36:01.083
Yes, it is.

36:10.833 --> 36:11.875
[Rebecca moans]

36:13.083 --> 36:14.208
[chuckles softly]

36:16.375 --> 36:17.958
Oh, my gosh, I need to get up.

36:18.041 --> 36:20.208
-No, in a minute.
-No, no, stop. Seriously.

36:20.291 --> 36:21.625
I'm serious, Pete.

36:21.708 --> 36:23.541
-Come back.
-[chuckling]

36:23.625 --> 36:25.375
Look, just hold that thought, okay?

36:25.458 --> 36:26.458
I have to go.

36:27.375 --> 36:28.791
-[sighs]
-But they can wait.

36:29.375 --> 36:30.208
Please.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.500
You're here another night, right?

36:39.541 --> 36:40.375
Right?

36:42.208 --> 36:43.041
At least.

36:44.708 --> 36:47.958
I'll tell Henry the house will blow up
if I don't stay the week.

36:48.041 --> 36:48.958
[chuckles softly]

36:49.041 --> 36:50.291
Then hold that thought.

36:51.416 --> 36:52.500
Just till tonight.

36:57.166 --> 36:58.083
[exhales]

36:59.500 --> 37:00.500
Come back to bed.

37:02.250 --> 37:03.375
Please.

37:06.250 --> 37:07.125
[chuckles softly]

37:08.541 --> 37:09.625
Patience.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.708
[footstep recede]

37:21.625 --> 37:24.000
Owen, apparently, you're cooking
for seven again tonight.

37:24.083 --> 37:27.000
-Oh, he-- he's staying tonight as well?
-Mm. Apparently.

37:27.083 --> 37:28.916
Although I'm not sure for how long.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.458
[Peter whistling "O Willow Waly"]

37:31.541 --> 37:32.708
What is that?

37:33.458 --> 37:36.125
That is a very specific Bordeaux,

37:36.208 --> 37:38.458
and it would knock
your knickers off, Hannah.

37:38.541 --> 37:39.375
Do you want a glass?

37:39.458 --> 37:41.458
Have you been in the wine cellar?

37:42.208 --> 37:43.333
Yeah, it's fine.

37:43.416 --> 37:44.416
Henry's blessed it.

37:45.416 --> 37:48.291
I'll save you a glass if you'd like.
It is a lovely year.

37:53.791 --> 37:55.791
[giggling] I can't. I have to get back!

37:55.875 --> 37:58.125
I know, I know.
Just a few minutes, please. Please.

37:58.708 --> 38:00.458
They've been at it again.

38:00.541 --> 38:03.416
-Why do they keep tracking mud in here?
-Well, make them clean it up.

38:03.500 --> 38:06.958
Well-- They shouldn't be in here at all.
<i>We </i>shouldn't be in here--

38:07.041 --> 38:09.125
It's fine.
We've got permission from the top.

38:09.208 --> 38:10.916
-The children--
-They're set.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.625
I've seen to it, okay?

38:13.791 --> 38:14.916
Okay.

38:15.000 --> 38:15.833
[sighs]

38:16.333 --> 38:17.166
Do you trust me?

38:18.416 --> 38:20.000
Yes, I trust you.

38:24.583 --> 38:25.416
-What?
-Wait.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.125
-What are you doing?
-It's a surprise.

38:27.208 --> 38:28.250
Oh, my gosh.

38:28.375 --> 38:30.708
-Okay, a few more steps.
-Mm-hm.

38:30.791 --> 38:32.958
-I don't have long.
-I know, I know, I know.

38:33.041 --> 38:34.666
-[Rebecca sighs]
-Okay.

38:34.750 --> 38:35.666
Open your eyes.

38:39.375 --> 38:40.208
Whose is that?

38:41.000 --> 38:42.166
It's yours.

38:43.208 --> 38:44.875
I don't understand.

38:44.958 --> 38:47.583
It's one of my projects,
inventory for this wing.

38:48.250 --> 38:50.375
There's a few things
going to auction, but…

38:50.916 --> 38:53.208
Henry said this was yours,
if you want it.

38:53.750 --> 38:55.250
-He didn't.
-He did.

38:56.875 --> 38:58.250
I mean, took a lot of convincing.

38:59.500 --> 39:00.625
But…

39:00.708 --> 39:02.458
I'm persuasive when I need to be.

39:04.166 --> 39:05.000
But…

39:05.125 --> 39:07.041
-this belonged to--
-She never wore it.

39:07.458 --> 39:09.875
He was adamant about that.
She never wore it, so…

39:10.833 --> 39:11.708
don't feel bad.

39:15.500 --> 39:16.333
Try it on.

39:18.875 --> 39:20.416
Go on, try it on!

39:23.208 --> 39:24.041
[chuckles]

39:27.125 --> 39:29.416
[music box playing "O Willow Waly"]

39:30.000 --> 39:30.958
No. No, no, no.

39:33.625 --> 39:34.791
See, fur like that…

39:36.000 --> 39:37.708
…you have to feel it on your skin.

39:38.625 --> 39:41.125
At least once in your life.
There's nothing like it.

39:58.666 --> 40:00.666
[song continues playing hauntingly]

40:10.625 --> 40:12.625
[sinister music plays quietly]

40:17.500 --> 40:18.500
[sighs]

40:28.875 --> 40:29.958
[Rebecca moans]

40:32.041 --> 40:33.333
Let me show you…

40:33.916 --> 40:35.500
just how beautiful you are.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
[chuckles softly]

40:39.041 --> 40:40.666
-[giggling]
-[camera shutter clicks]

40:43.250 --> 40:45.083
-Let me see, then.
-No.

40:45.166 --> 40:46.125
Not till the end.

40:56.333 --> 40:57.458
[moans softly]

41:07.333 --> 41:09.083
-[Hannah] Excuse me.
-[gasps]

41:10.250 --> 41:11.458
[both breathing heavily]

41:12.208 --> 41:14.125
The children, Rebecca, are on the lawn.

41:14.208 --> 41:16.333
-By themselves.
-[Rebecca] Yes, of course.

41:16.416 --> 41:18.625
-I'm so sorry.
-[Peter] They're fine. They're fine.

41:21.416 --> 41:23.083
The blouse, perhaps.

41:23.166 --> 41:24.000
Oh, gosh.

41:27.791 --> 41:28.625
I'm so sorry.

41:34.458 --> 41:36.916
-This wing is off limits.
-[Peter scoffs]

41:37.666 --> 41:39.000
Careful, Hannah.

41:39.083 --> 41:41.500
-You know that I can have--
-What? Have me fired?

41:42.708 --> 41:45.250
[scoffs]
Oh, yes, I know that very well, Peter.

41:45.333 --> 41:46.583
You've got his ear.

41:47.125 --> 41:50.250
You could have the lot of us out of here
if you truly wanted. Do you know what?

41:50.333 --> 41:52.333
Right now, I do not care.

41:53.125 --> 41:54.166
You see, if I ever…

41:54.708 --> 41:57.708
ever find you in here again,
in Charlotte's things, ever again,

41:57.791 --> 41:58.750
so help me God,

41:58.833 --> 42:01.125
I will drag you out of this house
by your bloody ear

42:01.208 --> 42:03.083
and throw you into that dirty lake.

42:04.500 --> 42:05.583
Do you understand me?

42:06.166 --> 42:08.000
[music box continues playing softly]

42:12.625 --> 42:13.458
Good.

42:14.750 --> 42:16.291
Now, clean this up.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
It's almost supper.

42:31.458 --> 42:34.791
[Owen] Oh, my God, this is divine!

42:34.875 --> 42:36.708
This is going to be an absurd cake.

42:37.208 --> 42:39.625
It needs something. Strawberry or lemon?

42:39.708 --> 42:41.916
-Me first because I'm older.
-I want to try the batter!

42:42.000 --> 42:44.583
I mean, I've made some good cakes
in my day,

42:44.666 --> 42:46.791
but this one is <i>batter.</i>

42:46.875 --> 42:47.750
[chuckles softly]

42:48.458 --> 42:50.875
Oh, a lot of long faces tonight.
We might need a bigger cake.

42:50.958 --> 42:53.125
-Let me try!
-All right, there you go.

42:53.250 --> 42:54.083
Go on.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.208
Mmm.

42:56.291 --> 42:57.291
-Divine.
-Hm.

42:57.375 --> 43:00.041
-But you should add more strawberry.
-[Miles] My turn.

43:03.250 --> 43:05.750
Hm. More lemon.
It needs more lemon.

43:06.375 --> 43:09.000
You all must try this. It's amazing!

43:09.666 --> 43:10.625
You'll agree.

43:10.708 --> 43:13.541
-It needs more strawberry.
-[Miles] Lemon.

43:13.625 --> 43:15.958
-[Jamie] All right, let me try.
-[Owen] Oh, no, not Jamie.

43:16.041 --> 43:18.083
There needs to be enough left
for an actual cake.

43:18.166 --> 43:19.083
[Jamie] Move over.

43:20.083 --> 43:20.958
[clears throat]

43:27.333 --> 43:28.416
-Strawberry.
-Ooh.

43:28.500 --> 43:29.333
Ha!

43:30.958 --> 43:32.125
[Owen] All right, love.

43:32.208 --> 43:33.875
A taste, then a smile.

43:33.958 --> 43:35.583
-Oh, no…
-Oh, come on, come on.

43:36.083 --> 43:37.333
Please, I'll be offended.

43:37.958 --> 43:39.625
There you go.
[gasps] Ooh!

43:39.708 --> 43:40.916
[children laughing]

43:41.000 --> 43:42.125
-Oh.
-Now I've done it.

43:42.208 --> 43:43.416
Oh, don't.

43:43.500 --> 43:44.583
-You're…
-No, no, no.

43:44.666 --> 43:46.083
…a battered woman.

43:46.166 --> 43:49.291
-[Hannah] For God's sakes.
-[children giggling]

43:51.458 --> 43:52.333
Mm.

43:52.916 --> 43:55.166
It's divine. Perfect just the way it is.

43:55.250 --> 43:57.041
[Owen] Well, that's useless! Hm.

43:57.125 --> 43:58.000
Come on, Rebecca.

43:58.750 --> 44:00.958
-[Rebecca scoffs]
-[Owen] Chin up. Mm-mm.

44:02.208 --> 44:03.166
[Hannah] Thank you.

44:05.625 --> 44:07.833
[Rebecca smacks lips]
Mmm. Delicious.

44:08.375 --> 44:09.375
I say…

44:09.875 --> 44:10.791
lemon.

44:10.875 --> 44:13.791
Oh, we have a proper batter royale.

44:14.625 --> 44:16.750
Come on, Pete, you're the tiebreaker.

44:16.833 --> 44:18.500
Oh, no, the pressure.

44:23.666 --> 44:24.500
[Owen] Hm.

44:26.541 --> 44:27.375
[smacks lips]

44:28.250 --> 44:29.625
Oh, God, that's amazing.

44:31.666 --> 44:33.083
I'm going to say…

44:34.958 --> 44:35.875
…strawberry.

44:35.958 --> 44:38.125
[Flora] Ha! In your face, Miles!

44:39.250 --> 44:40.833
[laughing] They're finally asleep.

44:40.916 --> 44:43.583
I swear, Flora's wearing
a cake's worth of batter.

44:44.916 --> 44:45.791
What's going on?

44:46.875 --> 44:48.208
I'm going back to London.

44:49.541 --> 44:51.333
-Oh, I-I… I thought--
-Yeah, well,

44:51.416 --> 44:54.541
we both had a disappointing evening,
haven't we, Rebecca?

44:54.625 --> 44:55.458
Um…

44:55.541 --> 44:56.791
When are you coming back?

44:57.458 --> 44:58.291
I don't know.

44:58.750 --> 44:59.666
Will it be long?

45:00.583 --> 45:01.833
I'm not sure.

45:03.083 --> 45:05.125
But you'll be fine, won't you?

45:07.541 --> 45:08.583
What do you mean?

45:11.083 --> 45:11.958
I mean…

45:12.916 --> 45:15.500
if you're gonna flirt with him
right in front of me,

45:16.000 --> 45:19.125
-why would I stay for that?
-[zips up bag abruptly]

45:20.541 --> 45:23.250
If you're hungry while I'm gone,
see if Owen can find something

45:23.333 --> 45:25.916
to stuff into your mouth,
since you're okay with that, apparently.

45:26.916 --> 45:28.083
Have you gone mad?

45:28.166 --> 45:30.166
-What are you talking--
-I'm talking about that man

45:30.250 --> 45:32.333
who you opened wide for not two hours ago.

45:32.416 --> 45:33.500
Mad!

45:35.750 --> 45:37.708
You wanted people to take you seriously.

45:38.166 --> 45:41.083
You said you took this job
'cause you didn't want old men

45:41.166 --> 45:44.125
looking up your skirt or down your blouse,
but age 'em down and dumb 'em up,

45:44.208 --> 45:46.250
and you just open up
when you're told, is that it?

45:46.750 --> 45:49.250
Do you have any idea what you look like?

45:50.541 --> 45:51.875
He-- he just…

45:51.958 --> 45:55.208
-He-- he asked me to taste his batter.
-God, fuck!

45:56.583 --> 45:57.583
[groans]

45:58.583 --> 46:00.375
You're naive when you want to be.

46:01.083 --> 46:02.208
That's good to know.

46:05.416 --> 46:09.083
It's good to know that when a man asks you
to put something in your mouth,

46:10.125 --> 46:11.500
he doesn't have to ask twice.

46:11.583 --> 46:14.625
He-- he… He didn't. You misunderstand.

46:14.708 --> 46:15.625
You'll be fine.

46:17.875 --> 46:18.791
[door slams]

46:24.583 --> 46:26.791
[indistinct conversations in distance]

46:26.875 --> 46:29.333
-[Hannah] I'll let you know.
-[Owen] Hannah, don't insult me.

46:29.416 --> 46:32.333
-[Hannah] It was only in my mouth.
-[Owen chuckles]

46:33.166 --> 46:34.916
[phone ringing]

46:41.416 --> 46:42.250
Hello?

46:49.750 --> 46:50.583
Peter?

46:51.166 --> 46:52.125
[line hangs up]

46:55.833 --> 46:57.708
Attention, please!

46:57.791 --> 46:58.833
[Dani] Flora!

46:58.916 --> 47:00.333
[Miles] Welcome to story time.

47:00.416 --> 47:02.250
How are you feeling?

47:02.333 --> 47:03.958
Oh, my God, you've gone into the makeup.

47:04.041 --> 47:05.750
It's story time.

47:05.833 --> 47:08.041
-Oh, God, story time.
-Oh, good, story time.

47:08.125 --> 47:09.333
[Miles] Come along.

47:13.625 --> 47:14.833
Like it never happened.

47:14.916 --> 47:16.750
They bounce back fast, these two.

47:17.416 --> 47:18.291
They've had to.

47:18.375 --> 47:21.375
That's right, it's your first story time.

47:21.458 --> 47:23.125
-Yeah.
-They do this a lot.

47:23.208 --> 47:24.541
-Oh! Uh…
-[Hannah] Yeah.

47:24.625 --> 47:26.166
-Let's get this over with.
-…exciting.

47:26.250 --> 47:29.916
[Owen]
Uh… Story time is a Flora special.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.625
-[Dani] Mm-hm.
-It's like therapy for them.

47:32.125 --> 47:34.250
Means she's processed
whatever she's been chewing on.

47:34.333 --> 47:35.500
-Right.
-[Flora] Attention.

47:35.583 --> 47:37.708
Welcome to story time.

47:37.791 --> 47:39.000
Go, Flora!

47:39.500 --> 47:40.958
That's not my name.

47:41.708 --> 47:42.916
That's not her name.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.541
[Flora] My name is Tales.

47:44.625 --> 47:46.000
And what are you, Tales?

47:46.625 --> 47:48.125
I'm a cat, of course.

47:48.208 --> 47:49.750
A cat named Tales.

47:50.250 --> 47:51.375
I've seen it all.

47:51.458 --> 47:55.333
As a kitten, I fell off an apple cart
and had nowhere to live.

47:56.333 --> 47:58.291
I wandered and mewed,

47:58.375 --> 48:03.583
and always followed the smell of apples
because maybe that meant I'd find my mum.

48:04.041 --> 48:05.916
My mum was an apple cat.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.583
[Miles] And what did you do?

48:08.375 --> 48:10.541
I found a giant jumper in the forest

48:11.041 --> 48:12.791
and pulled on the yarn.

48:12.875 --> 48:14.541
And pulled it all out.

48:14.625 --> 48:16.958
It took oh so long.

48:17.041 --> 48:18.458
Yarn of a tale.

48:18.541 --> 48:19.583
[adults chuckling]

48:19.666 --> 48:20.875
A tale of a yarn.

48:20.958 --> 48:22.416
But once it was done,

48:22.500 --> 48:24.875
it was so nice and warm.

48:24.958 --> 48:27.000
I wrapped myself tight.

48:27.083 --> 48:29.666
It was warm, it was right.

48:29.750 --> 48:31.291
In fact, don't react,

48:31.375 --> 48:33.875
like my strange little friend did.

48:34.833 --> 48:36.375
Because, once it was done,

48:36.875 --> 48:40.000
it was purr-fectly splendid.

48:40.500 --> 48:41.958
Yay!

48:44.541 --> 48:45.791
And what is your name?

48:46.291 --> 48:47.500
I'm Poppet…

48:47.583 --> 48:48.458
the puppet.

48:49.041 --> 48:50.875
And what are you, puppet?

48:50.958 --> 48:52.666
A puppet named Poppet.

48:53.708 --> 48:55.583
My maker was Claude.

48:56.041 --> 48:57.958
He made puppets aplenty.

48:58.916 --> 49:00.916
He loved them so much… [chuckles]

49:01.000 --> 49:02.541
…even though he had 20.

49:03.458 --> 49:05.083
One was too silly,

49:05.666 --> 49:08.000
and one was too stupid.

49:09.625 --> 49:11.041
One laughed too much,

49:11.916 --> 49:12.791
and the other…

49:17.000 --> 49:17.833
…too little.

49:20.875 --> 49:22.333
Claude went away…

49:23.083 --> 49:24.291
on a journey one day,

49:25.250 --> 49:26.791
and left the puppets at home.

49:28.708 --> 49:29.750
And as time went on…

49:31.083 --> 49:32.083
…soon…

49:32.166 --> 49:35.500
-they forgot they had strings.
-[ominous music building quietly]

49:35.583 --> 49:36.500
And later…

49:37.083 --> 49:39.625
they forgot they were even puppets at all.

49:41.208 --> 49:42.083
And then…

49:42.166 --> 49:43.791
[ominous music intensifying]

49:44.791 --> 49:46.041
…Claude came back…

49:48.125 --> 49:49.250
…so excited.

49:51.041 --> 49:52.875
But they had forgotten him, you see.

49:54.916 --> 49:56.375
And their strings.

49:59.791 --> 50:01.958
They laughed when he said he'd made them.

50:03.375 --> 50:04.583
They laughed at him.

50:05.750 --> 50:06.583
And he was…

50:07.333 --> 50:08.291
so sad.

50:09.875 --> 50:11.458
But they <i>kept </i>laughing.

50:11.541 --> 50:13.250
[yells] These stupid puppets!

50:14.708 --> 50:16.208
These stupid puppets

50:16.291 --> 50:17.416
who had forgotten!

50:18.541 --> 50:20.250
So, he pulled on their strings.

50:23.875 --> 50:24.791
And it hurt.

50:28.458 --> 50:29.541
[phone ringing]

50:30.250 --> 50:33.083
Thank Christ, Peter Quint to the rescue.
[clears throat]

50:34.000 --> 50:36.125
[phone ringing]

50:41.500 --> 50:43.750
Sorry, Pete. Bad news, but she's dead.

50:46.666 --> 50:47.541
Oh, God.

50:48.083 --> 50:48.958
Uh…

50:49.041 --> 50:51.291
Yeah, no. Yeah, he is. Just…

50:51.375 --> 50:52.458
Just one… one moment.

50:54.625 --> 50:56.208
I-It's your neighbor,

50:56.833 --> 50:57.791
Mr. McQueeny.

51:01.166 --> 51:03.250
Look, I am so sorry, Owen.

51:06.500 --> 51:07.541
I'm so sorry.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.250
[whispering indistinctly]

51:34.750 --> 51:35.625
[Owen sniffles]

51:52.541 --> 51:53.625
[engine turns over]

51:59.958 --> 52:01.750
I'm going to light a candle.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.166
[footsteps receding]

52:14.000 --> 52:15.166
[Dani clears throat]

52:20.125 --> 52:21.166
I'm so glad…

52:21.708 --> 52:22.791
you stayed.

52:26.166 --> 52:27.000
I am too.

52:27.666 --> 52:29.666
[melancholy orchestral music playing]
