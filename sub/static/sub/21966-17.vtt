00:03.375 --> 00:05.375
FRANKIE:

00:03.375 --> 00:05.375
Thanks for the lift, Heatwave.

00:05.417 --> 00:07.125
You're a lot faster

00:05.417 --> 00:07.125
than our Floating Lab.

00:07.166 --> 00:08.959
And way cooler.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.500
I sure don't mind getting away

00:09.000 --> 00:11.500
from fire for a day.

00:11.542 --> 00:14.125
One thing about the ocean,

00:11.542 --> 00:14.125
it doesn't burn.

00:17.208 --> 00:18.500
Sea monster!

00:21.250 --> 00:24.250
Or maybe...smudge?

00:24.291 --> 00:25.208
Sorry.

00:25.250 --> 00:27.417
Three more miles

00:25.250 --> 00:27.417
due east, Doc.

00:27.458 --> 00:30.500
Is that it?

00:27.458 --> 00:30.500
Drilling Platform Number 6.

00:30.542 --> 00:31.875
They used to call it

00:30.542 --> 00:31.875
"Old Faithful"

00:31.917 --> 00:33.208
when it was pumping oil.

00:33.250 --> 00:36.083
Then it went drier

00:33.250 --> 00:36.083
than Dani's meatloaf.

00:36.125 --> 00:38.834
So why start it up again

00:36.125 --> 00:38.834
after all these years?

00:38.875 --> 00:42.625
New owners. They think they can

00:38.875 --> 00:42.625
drill deeper and find more oil.

00:42.667 --> 00:46.208
I suspect the sea bed below

00:42.667 --> 00:46.208
the rig has become too unstable

00:46.250 --> 00:47.625
for any new drilling.

00:47.667 --> 00:49.417
That's what the mayor

00:47.667 --> 00:49.417
wants us to find out.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.709
The town can't issue

00:49.458 --> 00:51.709
any new drilling permits

00:51.750 --> 00:53.125
until we know for sure.

00:53.166 --> 00:54.959
Getting a little choppy, guys.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.500
Hang on.

00:56.542 --> 00:58.208
Whirlpool. Dead ahead!

00:58.250 --> 01:02.041
DOC:

00:58.250 --> 01:02.041
Turn, Heatwave! Quickly!

01:02.083 --> 01:05.875
Can't...pull free!

01:02.083 --> 01:05.875
Too strong.

01:05.917 --> 01:08.375
( all scream )

01:08.417 --> 01:10.875
Mayday! S.O.S.!

01:10.917 --> 01:12.667
Dad? Somebody?

01:12.709 --> 01:15.208
It's no use.

01:12.709 --> 01:15.208
There's no one around for miles!

01:15.250 --> 01:18.417
Uh... Wrong.

Uh, Heatwave? Is this

02:06.333 --> 02:09.250
a good guy or a bad guy?

02:09.291 --> 02:14.166
Insignia says Autobot, but I've

02:09.291 --> 02:14.166
never seen any bot that big.

02:17.583 --> 02:21.250
Well, it looks like

02:17.583 --> 02:21.250
he means us no harm...

so far.

Who is this guy?

02:37.792 --> 02:39.875
Hey, uh, thanks for the save,

02:37.792 --> 02:39.875
but--

02:39.917 --> 02:42.291
I got it from here! Let go!

02:42.333 --> 02:44.667
Hey, did you hear me?

02:44.709 --> 02:46.709
( Heatwave grunting )

02:50.083 --> 02:53.291
You gonna let us down

02:50.083 --> 02:53.291
or what?

03:16.041 --> 03:17.583
I don't know who you are,

03:17.625 --> 03:21.250
but you and I are gonna have

03:17.625 --> 03:21.250
some words!

03:23.750 --> 03:26.208
High Tide, my friend.

03:26.250 --> 03:28.458
Welcome to Earth.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.583
Opie, you old land yacht,

03:28.500 --> 03:31.583
how are you?

03:31.625 --> 03:32.959
Optimus?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.834
Thank you

03:33.000 --> 03:35.834
for answering my call.

03:35.875 --> 03:39.625
Good thing I did. I was havin'

03:35.875 --> 03:39.625
a gander at the local seabed

03:39.667 --> 03:41.542
when I caught their S.O.S.

03:41.583 --> 03:44.458
Found this wee rowboat

03:41.583 --> 03:44.458
circlin' the drain.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.375
Wait, you-- You know this guy?

03:47.417 --> 03:49.375
This is High Tide.

03:49.417 --> 03:51.417

03:51.458 --> 03:54.458
and the finest master seaman

03:51.458 --> 03:54.458

03:54.500 --> 03:57.792
High Tide,

03:54.500 --> 03:57.792
meet Rescue Bot Heatwave.

03:57.834 --> 04:01.417
And these are some of the humans

03:57.834 --> 04:01.417
I was telling you about.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.291
Doctor Greene and Frankie.

04:03.333 --> 04:05.166
Graham and Cody Burns.

04:05.208 --> 04:06.500
Nice to meet you.

04:05.208 --> 04:06.500
My pleasure.

04:06.542 --> 04:08.542
Hi.

04:06.542 --> 04:08.542
Thanks for saving us.

04:08.583 --> 04:12.625
Ah. Now then.

04:08.583 --> 04:12.625
You wanted some words with me.

04:12.667 --> 04:14.208
Any in particular?

04:14.250 --> 04:17.750
Just, uh... Well, thanks.

04:14.250 --> 04:17.750
For the rescue.

04:17.792 --> 04:22.208
Come, I want you to meet

04:17.792 --> 04:22.208
the rest of the team as well.

04:22.250 --> 04:23.542
Rowboat.

04:25.041 --> 04:28.208
OPTIMUS:

04:25.041 --> 04:28.208
High Tide has come

04:25.041 --> 04:28.208
at my request for a purpose,

04:28.250 --> 04:30.709
to make our team seaworthy.

04:30.750 --> 04:34.291
Is this about the time

04:30.750 --> 04:34.291
I accidentally sank Heatwave?

04:34.333 --> 04:37.333
No, Blades. This is about

04:34.333 --> 04:37.333
getting some advanced training

04:37.375 --> 04:39.291
in seagoing rescue techniques.

04:39.333 --> 04:41.375
We've made plenty

04:39.333 --> 04:41.375
of water rescues.

04:41.417 --> 04:44.208
I know, but if that old oil rig

04:41.417 --> 04:44.208
is reactivated,

04:44.250 --> 04:46.667
we may need skills

04:44.250 --> 04:46.667
beyond even yours.

04:46.709 --> 04:48.583
That's why I've asked Optimus

04:46.709 --> 04:48.583
for help.

04:48.625 --> 04:52.417
It does seem prudent.

04:48.625 --> 04:52.417
If my suspicions are confirmed,

04:52.458 --> 04:54.542
any new drilling

04:52.458 --> 04:54.542
could potentially trigger

04:54.583 --> 04:56.291
an ecological calamity.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.417
That is why

04:56.333 --> 04:58.417
I called in an expert.

04:58.458 --> 05:02.125
The Chief has graciously agreed

04:58.458 --> 05:02.125
to go without your services

05:02.166 --> 05:03.750
during your training.

05:03.792 --> 05:06.125
We can use our old rides

05:03.792 --> 05:06.125
for a few days.

05:06.166 --> 05:08.750
During that time,

05:06.166 --> 05:08.750
High Tide will lead you.

05:08.792 --> 05:12.667
Follow his instructions

05:08.792 --> 05:12.667
and learn from him.

05:12.709 --> 05:17.250
Ooh, new Honcho-Bot in town,

05:12.709 --> 05:17.250
big guy. Better watch your step.

05:17.291 --> 05:21.542
If Optimus says you're the real

05:17.291 --> 05:21.542
deal, that's good enough for me.

05:21.583 --> 05:24.166
Agreed. We will endeavor

05:21.583 --> 05:24.166
to make you proud.

05:24.208 --> 05:26.166
Ha. We'll see.

05:28.625 --> 05:33.166
In truth, High Tide has much

05:28.625 --> 05:33.166
to learn from the team as well.

05:33.208 --> 05:35.375
( alarm beeping )

05:35.417 --> 05:38.375
Oh, the smoke alarm.

05:35.417 --> 05:38.375
Meatloaf must be done. Dinner.

05:38.417 --> 05:40.125
You too, Doc and Frankie.

05:40.166 --> 05:43.792
( chuckles ):

05:40.166 --> 05:43.792
Thanks.

05:43.834 --> 05:48.041
One last thing, High Tide.

05:43.834 --> 05:48.041
I recommend having a human guide

05:48.083 --> 05:50.792
to help you negotiate

05:48.083 --> 05:50.792
their world.

05:50.834 --> 05:52.583
Don't trouble yourself,

05:50.834 --> 05:52.583
Opie.

05:52.625 --> 05:56.333
Frankly, I find the species

05:52.625 --> 05:56.333
not worth botherin' with.

05:56.375 --> 06:01.041
Humans may yet surprise you.

05:56.375 --> 06:01.041
I suggest Cody as your guide.

06:01.083 --> 06:04.417
He has experience

06:01.083 --> 06:04.417
orienting Autobots.

06:04.458 --> 06:08.000
I suppose a small one

06:04.458 --> 06:08.000
can't be too much trouble.

06:08.041 --> 06:11.500
He's hardly a blip

06:08.041 --> 06:11.500
on my radar.

06:13.458 --> 06:16.166
(  upbeat theme playing  )

06:16.208 --> 06:18.333
Ten-hut.

06:18.375 --> 06:22.041
Ha.

06:18.375 --> 06:22.041
Look at you scurvy wharf rats.

06:22.083 --> 06:24.917
Optimus didn't give me much

06:22.083 --> 06:24.917
to work with, did he?

06:24.959 --> 06:28.542
What are you supposed to be,

06:24.959 --> 06:28.542
some oversized skeeter-bot?

06:28.583 --> 06:31.458
Um, uh, actually,

06:28.583 --> 06:31.458
a helicopter, sir.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.125
It wasn't really my idea.

06:33.166 --> 06:36.625
You see, one day, just after

06:33.166 --> 06:36.625
we'd arrived on Earth--

06:36.667 --> 06:38.875
When I want your life story,

06:36.667 --> 06:38.875
I'll ask for it.

06:38.917 --> 06:41.583
Understand, Fly Boy?

06:41.625 --> 06:44.333
Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir.

06:41.625 --> 06:44.333
I mean--

06:44.375 --> 06:47.291
( whimpers then grunts )

06:47.333 --> 06:49.166
Ow.

06:50.667 --> 06:51.875

06:51.917 --> 06:54.333

06:54.375 --> 06:56.500
Whoa, noble.

Oil spill.

06:58.041 --> 07:00.542
(  upbeat theme playing  )

07:10.834 --> 07:13.208
CHASE:

07:10.834 --> 07:13.208
Sir, as I'm sure you are aware,

07:13.250 --> 07:16.291
the marine code classifies oil

07:13.250 --> 07:16.291
as a hazardous material,

07:16.333 --> 07:19.375
to be collected and disposed of

07:16.333 --> 07:19.375
responsibly.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.291
Wha--? Hear that, Servo?

07:21.333 --> 07:24.291
Why,

07:21.333 --> 07:24.291
we're practically criminals.

07:24.333 --> 07:27.166
But he's sure enough right.

07:27.208 --> 07:30.542
Here, Swabbie, start moppin'.

07:30.583 --> 07:34.875
Um... Oh. You mean me.

07:34.917 --> 07:38.208
To the best of my ability, sir.

07:34.917 --> 07:38.208
Swabbie?

07:38.250 --> 07:42.291
Job One is to make you

07:38.250 --> 07:42.291
mangy lot seaworthy. Servo.

07:42.333 --> 07:45.542
Some marine rescue gear

07:42.333 --> 07:45.542
for these sea slugs.

07:45.583 --> 07:46.792
( beeps )

07:46.834 --> 07:49.542
(  upbeat theme playing  )

07:55.417 --> 07:57.000
Too cool.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.834
You're the handiest Bot ever.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.834
Kinda cute too.

08:07.875 --> 08:09.166
( beeps )

08:11.083 --> 08:13.041
Big Red's already a fireboat,

08:13.083 --> 08:14.917
and the mosquito's got

08:13.083 --> 08:14.917
a rescue harness.

08:14.959 --> 08:18.000
So what to give you...

08:18.041 --> 08:19.041
Here.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.500
A surfboard?

08:23.542 --> 08:25.834
Um, I've never really

08:23.542 --> 08:25.834
learned how.

08:25.875 --> 08:27.917
Well, then it's about time

08:25.875 --> 08:27.917
you did.

08:27.959 --> 08:30.583
Anyway, the board'll do

08:27.959 --> 08:30.583
the surfin' for ya.

08:30.625 --> 08:31.625
Climb on.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.041
And for me, sir?

08:35.083 --> 08:37.291
You're doin' a fine job,

08:35.083 --> 08:37.291
Shippie. Keep at it.

08:37.333 --> 08:39.709
Now, there's a throttle

08:37.333 --> 08:39.709
under your front toe--

08:39.750 --> 08:41.583
( screams )

08:42.750 --> 08:46.709
Yeah! Use your knees!

08:42.750 --> 08:46.709
Lean into it.

08:46.750 --> 08:49.375
Whoa.

08:49.417 --> 08:51.250
Yee-haw!

08:52.750 --> 08:55.208
Wow!

08:52.750 --> 08:55.208
Ha, ha! Go, Boulder!

08:55.250 --> 09:00.000
I feel so light. So free!

09:00.041 --> 09:02.041
Whoa!

09:02.083 --> 09:04.083
Whoa!

09:04.125 --> 09:05.542
So sinking!

09:05.583 --> 09:07.417
Boulder!

09:09.166 --> 09:11.125
Boulder!

09:09.166 --> 09:11.125
( whimpers )

09:11.166 --> 09:12.875
Rescue Bots, roll to the--

09:12.917 --> 09:15.125
Belay that. He's heading

09:12.917 --> 09:15.125
for a deepwater trench.

09:15.166 --> 09:18.208
Way too risky

09:15.166 --> 09:18.208
for a crew of hatchlings.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.750
(  action theme playing  )

09:38.166 --> 09:40.333
I don't even know why I bother

09:38.166 --> 09:40.333
swabbing the deck.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.709
All anyone does

09:40.375 --> 09:42.709
is drip on it.

09:42.750 --> 09:46.959
Sorry, sir. Guess I got

09:42.750 --> 09:46.959
kinda carried away.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.041
You sure did.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.041
Almost permanent-like.

09:50.083 --> 09:52.709
At sea,

09:50.083 --> 09:52.709
there's no room for error.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.125
Yes, sir.

09:54.166 --> 09:56.250
It's okay, Boulder.

09:54.166 --> 09:56.250
I can't surf either.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.500
HIGH TIDE:

09:56.291 --> 09:58.500
Now, me dainties,

09:58.542 --> 10:02.250
if we can

09:58.542 --> 10:02.250
get back to our drills?

10:02.291 --> 10:04.458
Try to get this right, Flyboy.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.875
( whistles )

10:11.917 --> 10:13.917
Servo. Victim Mode.

10:16.834 --> 10:18.417
( whimpering )

10:18.458 --> 10:20.417
Don't approach into the sun!

10:20.458 --> 10:23.166
The glare off the water

10:20.458 --> 10:23.166
makes it too hard to see him.

10:23.208 --> 10:26.000
Swing that tail around.

10:23.208 --> 10:26.000
Hold your position steady.

10:26.041 --> 10:28.959
Now drop that line.

10:26.041 --> 10:28.959
CODY: Uh, Mr. High Tide?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.792
Blades actually does a lot

10:29.000 --> 10:31.792
better if you encourage him

10:31.834 --> 10:35.250
instead of yelling.

10:31.834 --> 10:35.250
Aw, do ya think so, Blip?

10:35.291 --> 10:39.375
Well, I've been training Bots

10:35.291 --> 10:39.375
for thousands of cycles,

10:39.417 --> 10:42.542
so I think I know

10:39.417 --> 10:42.542
how to train this one!

10:42.583 --> 10:46.208
BLADES:

10:42.583 --> 10:46.208
Okay, calm, deep breaths.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.083
Go to your happy place.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.792
Slow and easy-- Yikes!

10:49.834 --> 10:52.709
Speed it up, you balmy bug!

10:52.750 --> 10:54.208
( yells )

10:54.250 --> 10:55.834
(  dramatic theme playing  )

10:55.875 --> 10:57.709
Whoa!

11:08.250 --> 11:11.417
Any chance

11:08.250 --> 11:11.417
he didn't notice that?

11:11.458 --> 11:13.542
( whimpers )

11:13.583 --> 11:15.875
So, team,

11:13.583 --> 11:15.875
how'd your first day go?

11:15.917 --> 11:17.834
It wasn't my fault.

11:17.875 --> 11:22.000
That bad, huh?

11:17.875 --> 11:22.000
Well, you'll do better tomorrow.

11:22.041 --> 11:24.083
Whoa. What is that?

11:24.125 --> 11:26.500
His name is Servo.

11:26.542 --> 11:29.375
He appears to be a cross between

11:26.542 --> 11:29.375
a Schnauzer and a toolbox.

11:32.709 --> 11:33.834
( barks )

11:33.875 --> 11:35.792
Impressive.

11:33.875 --> 11:35.792
He belongs to High Tide.

11:35.834 --> 11:38.166
I just volunteered

11:35.834 --> 11:38.166
to buff out his dings

11:38.208 --> 11:41.583
after today's, um, incident.

11:38.208 --> 11:41.583
( growls )

11:41.625 --> 11:45.166
It wasn't my fault!

11:47.166 --> 11:49.417
GRAHAM:

11:47.166 --> 11:49.417
The rig's in even worse shape

11:47.166 --> 11:49.417
than we thought.

11:49.458 --> 11:54.041
Rusted beams, missing struts,

11:49.458 --> 11:54.041
exposed wiring.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.917
That's not all.

11:55.959 --> 11:58.333
The cap on this well

11:55.959 --> 11:58.333
looks dangerously corroded.

11:58.375 --> 12:01.500
If it gets any worse, it could

11:58.375 --> 12:01.500
cause a huge oil spill.

12:01.542 --> 12:03.125
I'll file my report today.

12:03.166 --> 12:05.333
I'm recommending

12:03.166 --> 12:05.333
that site be off limits

12:05.375 --> 12:08.041
until the rig is repaired

12:05.375 --> 12:08.041
and that old cap replaced.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.208
I agree.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.208
I'll order a new one,

12:10.250 --> 12:13.041
then run some tests to find

12:10.250 --> 12:13.041
the best way to install it.

12:15.083 --> 12:17.583
(  dramatic theme playing  )

12:27.083 --> 12:31.917
Now, let's see if we can get

12:27.083 --> 12:31.917
through this drill in one piece.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.959
Servo will dive into the brine.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.083
( beeps )

12:36.125 --> 12:38.458
Boulder, you'll surf in

12:36.125 --> 12:38.458
to scoop him up,

12:38.500 --> 12:39.875
then back to Heatwave.

12:39.917 --> 12:41.458
Be wary of the waves.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.291
They'll pull you under

12:41.500 --> 12:43.291
and keep you there.

12:43.333 --> 12:45.333
Chase, keep an eye on Boulder.

12:45.375 --> 12:48.709
Blades, y-- Blades?

12:48.750 --> 12:52.500
Where in blazes

12:48.750 --> 12:52.500
is that lily-livered locust?

12:52.542 --> 12:55.041
(  heroic theme playing  )

12:56.291 --> 12:58.625
( siren wailing )

13:03.625 --> 13:04.959
Take it easy, Milo.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.542
We're gonna take you

13:05.000 --> 13:06.542
to the hospital.

13:06.583 --> 13:09.542
Um, CopterBot?

13:06.583 --> 13:09.542
Return to base.

13:09.583 --> 13:13.291
Blades, you mangy moth.

13:09.583 --> 13:13.291
Get back here now.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.417
But, sir,

13:15.458 --> 13:16.875
a human needed help.

13:16.917 --> 13:18.291
Those weren't your orders.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.125
When you're under my command,

13:20.166 --> 13:22.750
you don't move till I say so.

13:22.792 --> 13:26.208
You're a washout, mosquito.

13:22.792 --> 13:26.208
A waste of Energon.

13:26.250 --> 13:28.041
CODY: And you're a big bully.

13:26.250 --> 13:28.041
( gasps )

13:28.083 --> 13:29.542
Whoa.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.542
Oh, dear.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.917
BOULDER: Uh-oh.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.917
Blades spotted a real emergency,

13:31.959 --> 13:34.166
and he did exactly

13:31.959 --> 13:34.166
the right thing,

13:34.208 --> 13:36.250
because he cares

13:34.208 --> 13:36.250
about people.

13:36.291 --> 13:38.542
We're here to help.

13:36.291 --> 13:38.542
Don't you get that?

13:38.583 --> 13:41.542
Ah, you got gumption, Blip,

13:38.583 --> 13:41.542
I'll give ya that.

13:41.583 --> 13:43.625
And I hate gumption.

13:43.667 --> 13:46.834
So stay outta things that aren't

13:43.667 --> 13:46.834
your concern, you hear me?

13:46.875 --> 13:50.834
We've all been hearing you.

13:46.875 --> 13:50.834
Now you hear me. Cody's right.

13:50.875 --> 13:53.500
I'm only sorry

13:50.875 --> 13:53.500
I didn't say it first.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.959
There's no more loyal or helpful

13:53.542 --> 13:56.959
Rescue Bot than Blades,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
in this or any other galaxy.

13:59.041 --> 14:02.041
Heatwave, you mean that?

13:59.041 --> 14:02.041
Not now.

14:02.083 --> 14:04.417
I don't care how chummy

14:02.083 --> 14:04.417
you are with Optimus.

14:04.458 --> 14:07.709
Nobody talks to my team

14:04.458 --> 14:07.709
that way. Nobody.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.417
That's it, bucko.

14:09.458 --> 14:13.291
Incompetence is one thing,

14:09.458 --> 14:13.291
but insubordination is another.

14:13.333 --> 14:14.750
Get off my ship!

14:14.792 --> 14:17.000
( growls )

14:17.041 --> 14:19.542
(  melancholic theme playing  )

14:24.291 --> 14:27.917
Well.

14:24.291 --> 14:27.917
Anybody else feelin' expendable?

14:27.959 --> 14:29.625
Before I let Optimus know

14:29.667 --> 14:32.625
what a bunch of slimy

14:29.667 --> 14:32.625
scallop roe you all are?

14:32.667 --> 14:34.125
I am unsure of the meaning,

14:34.166 --> 14:36.750
but I'm certain

14:34.166 --> 14:36.750
it was not complimentary.

14:38.083 --> 14:40.000
Sorry I let you down, Optimus.

14:40.041 --> 14:42.083
I know you wanted us

14:40.041 --> 14:42.083
to learn from him.

14:42.125 --> 14:44.250
High Tide can be demanding.

14:44.291 --> 14:47.709
Even harsh. But I asked him

14:44.291 --> 14:47.709
here for a reason.

14:47.750 --> 14:51.041
With all due respect, sir?

14:47.750 --> 14:51.041
He crossed a line.

14:51.083 --> 14:53.500
So maybe I should

14:51.083 --> 14:53.500
just sit this one out

14:53.542 --> 14:56.917
and let him teach the others.

14:53.542 --> 14:56.917
I would prefer you return.

14:56.959 --> 14:58.458
I don't believe

14:56.959 --> 14:58.458
either of you

14:58.500 --> 15:00.709
has finished learning

14:58.500 --> 15:00.709
from the other.

15:00.750 --> 15:04.375
But the decision

15:00.750 --> 15:04.375
must be yours.

15:07.125 --> 15:09.333
Hmm, as I feared.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.250
It's just peanut butter,

15:09.375 --> 15:11.250
Daddy.

15:11.291 --> 15:14.000
No, I mean

15:11.291 --> 15:14.000
these readings.

15:14.041 --> 15:15.917
I've been trying to determine

15:14.041 --> 15:15.917
the best way

15:15.959 --> 15:18.542
to install that new oil cap.

15:18.583 --> 15:21.166
But the situation is more

15:18.583 --> 15:21.166
critical than I thought.

15:21.208 --> 15:25.208
This entire area is far too

15:21.208 --> 15:25.208
unstable for future drilling,

15:25.250 --> 15:27.250
with any rig.

15:27.291 --> 15:31.166
One tremor

15:27.291 --> 15:31.166
could trigger a disaster.

Griffin Rock Emergency. What?

16:04.667 --> 16:07.375
Right away.

16:04.667 --> 16:07.375
Cody, call High Tide.

16:07.417 --> 16:10.291
Tell him we need him

16:07.417 --> 16:10.291
and the Bots. Now.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.333
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

16:15.291 --> 16:17.375
I see them, just barely.

16:17.417 --> 16:19.041
They're surrounded

16:17.417 --> 16:19.041
by burning oil.

16:19.083 --> 16:21.291
And that rig

16:19.083 --> 16:21.291
looks ready to fall over.

16:21.333 --> 16:23.375
Do your job, Mosquito.

16:23.417 --> 16:26.041
Yes, sir.

16:23.417 --> 16:26.041
No, Blades.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.709
We can't reach them,

16:26.083 --> 16:28.709
the fire's too high.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.375
We'll have to find another way.

16:30.417 --> 16:32.083
HIGH TIDE:

You, Red. Outta my cabin.

Where I'm goin', you can't.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.250
But--

16:34.000 --> 16:36.250
Too dangerous. Now scoot.

16:37.542 --> 16:38.917
What-- What are we--?

CHIEF:

16:57.500 --> 16:58.834
High Tide. Any luck?

16:58.875 --> 17:01.834
I tried to plug the leak.

17:01.875 --> 17:03.709
Couldn't be done.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.750
We await your orders, sir.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.750
What now?

17:05.792 --> 17:09.000
Argh. Your cockamamie planet

17:05.792 --> 17:09.000
and its flaming oceans.

Too dangerous.

17:30.333 --> 17:33.250
I need some of that goo

you used to soak up the oil.

17:33.291 --> 17:37.208
Oh, and, uh...permission

17:33.291 --> 17:37.208
to come aboard, sir.

17:37.250 --> 17:40.542
Granted. Chase. You and Servo

17:37.250 --> 17:40.542
load up his tanks

17:40.583 --> 17:41.959
with the dispersant.

17:47.542 --> 17:49.250
We need to put that new cap

17:47.542 --> 17:49.250
on the leak.

17:49.291 --> 17:51.000
But we have to get to it first.

17:51.041 --> 17:52.750
I'm going in

17:51.041 --> 17:52.750
for Doc and Frankie.

17:52.792 --> 17:55.000
Follow me on your board.

17:52.792 --> 17:55.000
Chase, you with us?

17:55.041 --> 17:57.458
I am not sure my mopping

17:55.041 --> 17:57.458
experience will prove useful,

17:57.500 --> 17:58.959
but I am most happy

17:57.500 --> 17:58.959
to help.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Rescue Bots,

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
surf to the rescue.

18:02.041 --> 18:04.834
( grunts )

18:04.875 --> 18:07.500
(  upbeat action theme playing  )

18:17.542 --> 18:20.166
I told you, Daddy.

18:20.208 --> 18:22.542
( rumbling )

18:22.583 --> 18:25.208
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:31.083 --> 18:32.917
The oil rig's

18:31.083 --> 18:32.917
gonna fall!

18:32.959 --> 18:35.625
We can help.

18:32.959 --> 18:35.625
Blades, drop your winch.

18:35.667 --> 18:37.125
I'll keep you above the smoke.

18:37.166 --> 18:38.917
Boulder, you're our eyes.

18:38.959 --> 18:43.625
Swinging tail around

18:38.959 --> 18:43.625
and holding steady.

18:43.667 --> 18:47.458
More to the left. Lower.

18:43.667 --> 18:47.458
Almost there.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.500
That's it. Pull up.

18:53.875 --> 18:57.667
Unh! It's getting

18:53.875 --> 18:57.667
a little heavy.

18:57.709 --> 18:59.500
HEATWAVE:

18:57.709 --> 18:59.500
We're almost clear.

18:59.542 --> 19:01.375
Now!

19:03.583 --> 19:05.417
HIGH TIDE:

19:03.583 --> 19:05.417
Move your tail-lights!

19:14.583 --> 19:17.208
Ready with the cap?

19:17.250 --> 19:20.542
( all grunting )

19:20.583 --> 19:23.291
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:31.375 --> 19:33.792
( all grunt )

19:33.834 --> 19:36.500
It refuses to stay in place.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.709
CODY:

19:36.542 --> 19:38.709
High Tide. Time to go Mega-Bot.

19:38.750 --> 19:40.417
Just what I was thinkin',

19:38.750 --> 19:40.417
Blip.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.875
You'll be a sailor yet.

19:56.166 --> 19:58.583
(  action theme playing  )

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
( metal clicks )

20:04.041 --> 20:05.291
Nice.

20:05.333 --> 20:07.792
Hoo-hoo.

20:05.333 --> 20:07.792
Nice, High Tide.

20:07.834 --> 20:10.000
KADE:  All right.

20:07.834 --> 20:10.000
DOC:  Outstanding.

20:11.583 --> 20:13.709
GRAHAM:

20:11.583 --> 20:13.709
The rig was destroyed,

20:11.583 --> 20:13.709
Mayor Luskey.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.542
And I'm afraid the site

20:13.750 --> 20:15.542
is too dangerous

20:15.583 --> 20:18.917
to consider

20:15.583 --> 20:18.917
any future drilling permits.

20:18.959 --> 20:22.625
I got to admit, Opie, your bilge

20:18.959 --> 20:22.625
rats got the right stuff.

20:22.667 --> 20:25.083
Even the whirlybird

20:22.667 --> 20:25.083
found high gear.

20:25.125 --> 20:28.834
Sadly, that's the nicest thing

20:25.125 --> 20:28.834
he's ever said to me.

20:28.875 --> 20:30.250
Good work, skeeter.

20:30.291 --> 20:32.083
Second nicest.

20:32.125 --> 20:34.458
OPTIMUS:

20:32.125 --> 20:34.458
You have taught them,

20:32.125 --> 20:34.458
High Tide.

20:34.500 --> 20:37.208
But you have also learned

20:34.500 --> 20:37.208
from them.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.500
And that was your plan

20:37.250 --> 20:39.500
from the get-go, weren't it,

20:39.542 --> 20:41.166
you old scalliwag?

20:41.208 --> 20:43.000
Well, you were right.

20:43.041 --> 20:46.458
Teamin' up with humans might not

20:43.041 --> 20:46.458
be the worst idea ever.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.875
You all work well together.

20:48.917 --> 20:53.375
And it might be my management

20:48.917 --> 20:53.375
style could use a bit of...

20:53.417 --> 20:54.709
finessing.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.542
OPTIMUS:

20:54.750 --> 20:56.542
I have one more request.

20:56.583 --> 21:00.208
Since Dr. Greene's Floating Lab

20:56.583 --> 21:00.208
was lost in the fire,

21:00.250 --> 21:03.125
would you be willing to remain

21:00.250 --> 21:03.125
on Earth for a time

21:03.166 --> 21:04.834
to take its place?

21:04.875 --> 21:07.875
Till I'm needed elsewhere,

21:04.875 --> 21:07.875
it'd be my pleasure.

21:07.917 --> 21:09.959
I'm off. Servo?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.583
Stay here and watch over

21:10.000 --> 21:12.583
these lollygaggers.

21:12.625 --> 21:14.250
That's an order.

21:14.291 --> 21:17.750
Blip-- Uh, Cody.

21:14.291 --> 21:17.750
Here's his whistle.

21:17.792 --> 21:19.667
Keep it for me, will you?

21:19.709 --> 21:22.458
Noble.

21:19.709 --> 21:22.458
