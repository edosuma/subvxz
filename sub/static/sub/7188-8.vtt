11:53.879 --> 11:56.482
I'LL BRING YOUR OLD MAN.
YOU HANDLE YOUR MOM.

11:56.482 --> 11:57.983
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO--

11:57.983 --> 11:59.518
SUSAN, IT IS FOR THE BEST.

11:59.518 --> 12:02.455
YOU ARE BETTER OFF WITH
SOMEONE WHO WALKS FORWARD.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.558
SOMEONE WITH A HAIRSTYLE
BEFITTING TO THIS PLANET.

12:05.558 --> 12:10.396
SOMEONE--AAH!

12:10.396 --> 12:12.498
SOMEONE MAGICAL.

12:12.498 --> 12:15.968
YOUNG DRAGON,
I AM IN YOUR DEBT.

12:15.968 --> 12:17.436
WHO ARE YOU?

12:17.436 --> 12:20.473
UH, MY NAME IS, UH...

12:20.473 --> 12:23.375
B-BEYONCE TIMBERLAKE.

12:23.375 --> 12:26.312
I'M THE, UH,
CANADIAN DRAGON. EH?

12:26.312 --> 12:31.016
BEYONCE TIMBERLAKE?
WHAT KIND OF BOGUS NAME
IS BEYONCE TIMBERLAKE?

12:31.016 --> 12:34.453
PERHAPS THE NAME
OF YOUR FUTURE HUSBAND.

12:34.453 --> 12:38.457
AS IF. DAD, I STILL
LOVE JONATHAN.

12:38.457 --> 12:40.493
I UNDERSTAND,
MY LOTUS FLOWER.

12:40.493 --> 12:43.996
A BROKEN HEART
NEEDS TIME TO HEAL.

12:43.996 --> 12:46.999
WELL, TIME'S UP.
[WHISTLES]

12:46.999 --> 12:49.568
JONES BEACH, KEEP
THE METER RUNNING,

12:49.568 --> 12:51.570
AND HAVE THEM BACK
BY MIDNIGHT.

12:51.570 --> 12:53.539
WHO NEEDS A STUPID
BEACH PARTY?

12:53.539 --> 12:56.275
I CAN HAVE PLENTY OF FUN
RIGHT HERE.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.476
HOLY HAMMOCKS. I DID IT.

12:57.476 --> 13:01.881
IT TOOK ME 3 YEARS,
BUT I FINALLY FINISHED IT.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.483
WHOA. WHAT IN THE...?

13:04.483 --> 13:06.919
YOU GRODY MUTT.
GET BACK HERE.

13:06.919 --> 13:10.489
BEYONCE, I'M REALLY SORRY
MY DAD PUT YOU UP TO THIS.

13:10.489 --> 13:13.325
IT'S COOL. AS FAR AS
I'M CONCERNED,

13:13.325 --> 13:16.495
[ACCENT]
IT'S ALL ABOUT
YOU AND JONATHAN.

13:16.495 --> 13:19.298
THIS IS HOPELESS.
HE ISN'T COMING.

13:19.298 --> 13:23.702
JONATHAN'S NEVER GONNA
ACCEPT ME FOR WHO I AM.

13:24.036 --> 13:26.305
MOM, NO. WAIT.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.606
COME BACK.

13:27.606 --> 13:33.445
I AM NEVER
TIME TRAVELING AGAIN.

13:33.445 --> 13:36.582
FU, WE'RE GONNA NEED
A PLAN C. MOM BAILED.

13:36.582 --> 13:38.017
WHAT?

13:39.952 --> 13:41.887
KID, TIME'S ALMOST UP.

13:41.887 --> 13:44.390
I...BELIEVE...

13:44.390 --> 13:47.660
THAT'S...MINE.

13:50.029 --> 13:51.664
WHA-WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

13:51.664 --> 13:55.701
HEY, DAD--I MEAN, DUDE,
I KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW ME,

13:55.701 --> 13:57.536
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

13:57.536 --> 14:00.506
YOU AND SUSAN
GET BACK TOGETHER.
LIVES DEPEND ON IT.

14:00.506 --> 14:07.546
I'M FROM THE FUTURE,
AND YOU AND SUSAN
ARE MY PARENTS.

14:07.546 --> 14:12.451
YEAH, RIGHT. AND I SUPPOSE
THAT'S A MAGICAL TALKING DOG.

14:12.451 --> 14:14.386
YOU ARE CORRECT, SIR.
AAH!

14:14.386 --> 14:17.723
SEE? THAT'S YOU
AND THAT'S MOM
AND THAT'S ME

14:17.723 --> 14:18.958
AND THAT'S
YOUR DAUGHTER.

14:18.958 --> 14:20.793
WE'RE A REALLY
HAPPY FAMILY,

14:20.793 --> 14:22.695
EXCEPT THAT
YOU GROUND ME,
A LOT.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.531
UH-HUH, YEAH. LOOK,
WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS,

14:25.531 --> 14:27.733
THIS HAS BEEN THE WORST
DAY OF MY LIFE, OK?

14:27.733 --> 14:29.869
THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS
IS A DRAGON,

14:29.869 --> 14:32.371
THERE'S DOG SLOBBER
ON MY PUZZLE GAME,

14:32.371 --> 14:34.940
AND I CAN'T GET MY COLLAR
TO STAY UP TO SAVE MY LIFE.

14:34.940 --> 14:37.576
SO IF THIS IS SOME KIND
OF SICK JOKE...

14:37.576 --> 14:41.814
DRAGON UP.
NOW DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

14:41.814 --> 14:44.617
AAH! [STAMMERS]

14:44.617 --> 14:47.519
COULD THIS DAY
GET ANY WORSE?

14:47.519 --> 14:50.422
IT JUST DID, DRAGON.

14:52.524 --> 14:54.927
IT'S YOU. THE HUNTSMAN.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.595
DUDE, WHAT'S WITH THE VOICE?

14:56.595 --> 14:58.964
YOU SOUND LIKE AN ACCORDION
STUCK IN A WOOD CHIPPER.

14:58.964 --> 15:03.802
NO ONE MAKES FUN
OF MY VOICE.

15:06.605 --> 15:08.574
WHOA!

15:17.082 --> 15:23.589
HAH. AT LAST, I SHALL SLAY
MY FIRST DRAGON.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.157
AAH!

15:25.157 --> 15:28.560
WHOA-A-A-A! OOF.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.835
GET USED TO HAVING ME
WHIP YOU, HUNTSPUNK,

15:36.835 --> 15:40.606
'CAUSE IN ABOUT 20 YEARS,
I'M GONNA BE--WAAH!

15:42.174 --> 15:43.509
WHOA!

15:43.509 --> 15:47.780
ENJOY MY DETONATOR, DRAGON.
[BEEPING]

15:47.780 --> 15:51.517
NO WAY AM I FETCHING THAT.
HUH?

15:51.517 --> 15:54.486
YAAH!
TAKE COVER.

15:59.591 --> 16:02.227
SHOW YOURSELF, DRAGON.

16:06.799 --> 16:10.602
[BOTH COUGHING]

16:12.738 --> 16:16.575
OH, NO, DAD!

16:19.611 --> 16:23.015
NO, NO! THIS IS
ALL MY FAULT.

16:23.015 --> 16:26.251
IT'S BECAUSE OF MY LETTER.
DAD, WE HAVE TO SAVE HIM.

16:26.251 --> 16:28.487
THERE, THERE.
WE WILL DO OUR BEST.

16:28.487 --> 16:32.491
ALTHOUGH, MY DAUGHTER,
THERE ARE STILL PLENTY
OF FISH IN THE SEA.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.627
OK, OK. I WAS JUST
PUTTING IT OUT THERE.

16:35.627 --> 16:38.230
LOOK, THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME WAY WE CAN FIND HIM.

16:38.230 --> 16:41.567
I DIDN'T WANT
TO SHOW YOU THIS,
BUT, UH...HA HA HA.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.535
I HAVE BEEN USING
AN ENCHANTED COMPASS

16:43.535 --> 16:45.704
TO KEEP TRACK OF JONATHAN
ON YOUR DATES.

16:45.704 --> 16:51.744
MY DARLING, I MAY POSSESS
ALL THE MAGIC AND STRENGTH
OF A GREAT DRAGON WARRIOR,

16:51.744 --> 16:54.013
BUT I AM ALSO A SINGLE DAD.

16:54.013 --> 16:58.283
FOR THE LAST TIME,
IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE,

16:58.283 --> 17:01.120
YOU WILL TELL ME
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.822
I WILL TELL YOU NOTHING!

17:03.822 --> 17:06.925
VERY WELL.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.230
OHH...

17:11.230 --> 17:12.564
[BEAST ROARS]

17:12.564 --> 17:16.835
IN THE TENTH GRADE,
I FILLED MY TEACHER'S TRUNK
WITH 3-BEAN SALAD.

17:16.835 --> 17:21.140
IN THE SEVENTH GRADE,
I DROVE OUR LAWNMOWER OVER
OUR SISTER'S POOL...

17:21.140 --> 17:24.576
AND IN SIXTH GRADE,
I TOOK ALL THE MONEY I MADE
FOR THE LESS FORTUNATE

17:24.576 --> 17:26.545
AND SPENT IT AT THE ARCADE!

17:26.545 --> 17:28.247
TELL US THE LOCATION
OF THE DRAGONS.

17:28.247 --> 17:32.584
WHY PUT YOURSELF IN
HARM'S WAY JUST TO PROTECT
SOME HIDEOUS MONSTERS?

17:32.584 --> 17:36.155
SEE? THAT'S YOU
AND THAT'S MOM
AND THAT'S ME

17:36.155 --> 17:41.693
AND THAT'S YOUR DAUGHTER.
WE'RE A REALLY HAPPY FAMILY.

17:41.693 --> 17:44.830
THE ONLY MONSTERS I SEE
ARE YOU!

17:44.830 --> 17:47.633
CHECK IT.
HE'S DEFENDING US.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.101
HE'S SO BRAVE.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.103
MY DAUGHTER,
IF AN ORDINARY HUMAN

17:51.103 --> 17:53.272
IS DESTINED
TO BE YOUR TRUE LOVE,

17:53.272 --> 17:55.808
I SUPPOSE
YOU COULD DO WORSE.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.845
VERY WELL. LET'S BEGIN.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.413

WITH THE CLAWING AND PINCHING.

HE WAS, "SAY GOODBYE, DRAGON,"

19:31.837 --> 19:35.707

AND EVERY ONE OF THEM

AND HIT YOUR HEAD.

19:53.458 --> 19:56.929
WHAT ABOUT THE FREAKOS
WHO WERE TORTURING ME?

19:56.929 --> 20:00.065
THEY WANTED INFORMATION
ABOUT YOU GUYS BEING DRAGONS.

20:00.065 --> 20:02.000
WE HAD THAT FIGHT, REMEMBER?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.902

SOUNDS LIKE

20:03.902 --> 20:06.171
