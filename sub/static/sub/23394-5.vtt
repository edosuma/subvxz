WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.244
Another boy has been murdered.

00:06.256 --> 00:08.999
I think it necessary
that arrangements be made.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.921
In the best interest
of your son, of course.

00:11.053 --> 00:16.219
The cripple in him is looking
for the cripple in another.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.717
We won't find him
by dissecting our own minds.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.560
Nor shall we find him by looking
for men with silver smiles.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.350
We must see
what's behind the clues.

00:23.482 --> 00:26.270
Come on, Sara.
We don't have to listen to this.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.643
Go on, then, both of you.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.965
And come back when you're able
to look inside yourselves.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.072
Mrs. Santorelli
and her son brought this to me

00:33.200 --> 00:34.361
at police headquarters.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.234
Why wasn't killing
the boy enough?

00:36.370 --> 00:38.236
Why must you send a letter
as well?

00:38.372 --> 00:40.238
He's watching us.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.246
Which one of you is up for
a little fun?

01:03.564 --> 01:06.853
It seems clear that...

01:06.984 --> 01:09.021
...the slashing downstrokes

01:09.152 --> 01:13.271
and... the extreme angle
of the characters

01:13.407 --> 01:16.445
suggest a tormented
human being...

01:16.577 --> 01:18.819
...one for whom no relief
can be found,

01:18.954 --> 01:22.447
save through a demonstration
of anger and violence.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.116
The man who wrote this,

01:25.252 --> 01:26.868
and the attack of the pen
in this case,

01:27.004 --> 01:28.791
is undoubtedly masculine.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.504
The man who wrote this note

01:30.632 --> 01:32.464
has had at least several years
of schooling

01:32.593 --> 01:34.175
that entailed penmanship.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.103
This instruction occurred
in the United States

01:36.221 --> 01:37.462
no more than 15 years ago.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.181
You sound quite sure,
Mr. Macleod.

01:40.309 --> 01:42.801
Dr. Kreizler,
as a professional graphologist,

01:42.936 --> 01:44.928
it is my business to be sure.

01:45.063 --> 01:48.147
There is every indication
that this man was trained,

01:48.275 --> 01:49.891
hard and regularly,

01:50.027 --> 01:53.316
in the style of penmanship
known as the Palmer Method.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.780
The Palmer Method was introduced
in the late '70s

01:55.907 --> 01:57.899
and was quickly adopted
by primary schools

01:58.035 --> 01:59.401
all over the country.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.902
Thus, if we assume that...

02:01.038 --> 02:03.906
If we assume that our scribe
ended his primary education

02:04.041 --> 02:06.078
no later than, say, age 15,

02:06.209 --> 02:08.667
he cannot now be any older
than 35.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.832
Or younger than 24.

02:12.883 --> 02:16.547
I do hope that this letter
has been written in jest.

02:17.721 --> 02:22.432
Or is, in fact,
a training exercise?

02:24.478 --> 02:27.061
Thank you for coming,
Mr. Macleod.

02:27.189 --> 02:30.148
Please send the invoice for
your services to my attention.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.069
Detective Sergeants, I believe
you have something more to say

02:43.205 --> 02:44.571
on the matter.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.623
We have found numerous prints,
uh, probably belonging

02:47.751 --> 02:50.494
to members of the Santorelli
family or Sara here.

02:50.629 --> 02:51.814
But by employing a method

02:51.838 --> 02:54.150
using a silver nitrate solution,
we were able to match a print

02:54.174 --> 02:55.540
found on the Zweig boy's watch.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.339
To one taken on the stamp...

02:59.429 --> 03:01.011
...from the envelope.

03:02.557 --> 03:06.346
Along with Mr. Macleod's
assessment of his penmanship...

03:07.187 --> 03:11.227
...I have extracted some words
and phrases found in the letters

03:11.358 --> 03:14.476
which could prove crucial.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.900
"Dirty Immigrants."
"Saucy Boy."

03:18.490 --> 03:20.698
"Dirt and Paint."
The "19th of February."

03:20.826 --> 03:21.928
One thing is certain...

03:21.952 --> 03:23.864
His spelling leaves much
to be desired.

03:23.995 --> 03:27.204
But it could be an attempt
to misdirect our suspicions.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.369
If nothing else,
his deliberate phrasing implies

03:29.501 --> 03:33.745
a certain joy, if not obsession,
at desecrating the body.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.415
Perhaps he's mirroring a...

03:37.551 --> 03:40.294
an action that he learned
or witnessed firsthand.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.469
Are you suggesting that he
himself could be a victim

03:42.514 --> 03:43.514
of such horrible acts?

03:43.515 --> 03:46.553
A man reliving the violence
inflicted upon him as a child.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.348
I think we can safely say
that whoever wrote it as a man

03:49.479 --> 03:53.223
while still a child
was embarrassed, harassed,

03:53.358 --> 03:56.271
beaten, very likely assaulted.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.315
I might offer that
the hand most responsible

03:58.447 --> 03:59.779
might be that of a man.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.239
But the intimate nature
of other aspects seems to me

04:02.367 --> 04:05.576
to be the rather sinister
presence of a woman.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.991
If your theory were sound,
Miss Howard, wouldn't it hold

04:08.123 --> 04:10.831
that the victims,
like the Ripper's, be women?

04:10.959 --> 04:13.793
The letter is addressed
to Mrs. Santorelli,

04:13.920 --> 04:16.286
its tone both defensive
and whining.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.915
It's filled with scatological
and anatomical detail.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.653
Isn't that the voice of a boy
who's been made to feel

04:20.677 --> 04:21.677
that he himself is filth?

04:21.678 --> 04:23.135
How many households
have you known

04:23.263 --> 04:25.074
that are ruled by a dominant
and violent mother?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.098
Certainly you would agree

04:26.099 --> 04:27.410
there's more than one kind
of violence.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.578
Look at your friend here to see

04:28.602 --> 04:30.246
who has had more influence
on his childhood.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.138
Laszlo, my mother was absent
a good deal of my childhood.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.606
Doctor, we're not talking about
the gilded upbringing

04:35.734 --> 04:37.670
of a handsome but indolent
member of the leisure class.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.651
There is nothing
in the literature to suggest

04:39.780 --> 04:42.133
the involvement of a woman...
not in Breuer, not in Freud...

04:42.157 --> 04:44.343
Why do you resist the notion of
a woman's active involvement...

04:44.367 --> 04:46.529
Because had a woman
been dominant in his life

04:46.661 --> 04:48.744
at any point,
we wouldn't even be here!

04:48.872 --> 04:50.784
These crimes would never
have happened!

05:39.297 --> 05:41.038
Sara!

05:41.174 --> 05:43.006
Sara, wait!

05:43.134 --> 05:45.717
He's made it quite clear
that the only opinion he values

05:45.846 --> 05:47.178
is one that reflects his own.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.718
Well, I admit he can be
rather pigheaded

05:49.850 --> 05:52.161
and impatient at times, but you
shouldn't take it personally.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.346
He's that way with everyone.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.185
He is a bully,
and I will not be bullied.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.020
Shine, mister?
Shine?

05:57.148 --> 06:00.016
I doubt any man living
could bully you.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.711
- Don't patronize me.
- Shine, sir?

06:01.820 --> 06:03.061
All right.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.196
Thanks.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.083
Do you really expect me
to stand here and wait

06:08.201 --> 06:09.737
while you get your boots shined?

06:09.870 --> 06:11.236
As a matter of fact, I do.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.247
Why?

06:12.248 --> 06:14.113
Because you find me handsome.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.740
I said you were handsome
and indolent.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.792
Damned with faint praise.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.129
Besides, I rather see it not so
much as having my boots shined

06:22.257 --> 06:24.749
as offering a poor boy
honest work.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.717
And what do you know
of honest work?

06:26.845 --> 06:28.336
I know I don't care for it.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.303
A slothful nature
and a fondness for alcohol

06:30.432 --> 06:31.764
can be overcome with hard work

06:31.892 --> 06:33.244
and a willingness
to change your life.

06:33.268 --> 06:36.136
I'm afraid you sound
just like my old grandmother.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.623
Well, maybe you should listen
to her.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.888
Oh. Very well, then.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.141
Sara Howard, will you marry me?

06:47.073 --> 06:49.440
I, John Schuyler Moore...

06:49.576 --> 06:52.239
...take thee, Sara Howard,

06:52.370 --> 06:54.783
to be my wedded wife
from this day forward...

06:55.624 --> 06:58.583
...for better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.497
And to give you
lots of little children

07:00.629 --> 07:04.873
who will be as lazy as me and
just as stubborn as yourself.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.965
If I thought you had
a sincere bone in your body,

07:07.093 --> 07:09.380
I might consider your offer.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.510
- Hey!
- Don't go.

07:17.646 --> 07:18.604
Whoa!

07:18.605 --> 07:20.642
I thought we might at least
have dinner together.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.141
The commissioner expects me
in the office when he arrives,

07:23.276 --> 07:25.438
and I have too much work to do.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.156
Sara?

07:30.283 --> 07:34.448
If I were to ask you
and meant it,

07:34.579 --> 07:36.036
what would you say?

08:33.346 --> 08:35.337
Professor Cavanaugh?

08:35.472 --> 08:37.840
Is that Laszlo Kreizler?

08:37.976 --> 08:40.217
I'd recognize that voice
anywhere.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.562
Please don't get up, Professor.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.517
May I?

08:52.741 --> 08:55.700
Thank you for agreeing to meet,
Professor.

08:56.286 --> 09:00.246
You were a remarkable student,
Laszlo.

09:00.832 --> 09:03.040
I've followed your work
with great interest.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.036
In this case, sir, the student
needs a remedial lesson

09:06.171 --> 09:08.208
on what it means
to be a student.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.587
I remember your first day
on campus.

09:12.719 --> 09:16.588
You came to me
and you asked to take my class.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.591
You were unsure
about your future, you said,

09:19.726 --> 09:21.513
and an introduction
to ornithology

09:21.644 --> 09:25.558
led you down a path that you
didn't even know you would take.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.851
You put me in a room and...

09:29.986 --> 09:32.194
gave me a preserved specimen
to study.

09:32.322 --> 09:35.235
Hildebrandt's starling.

09:35.366 --> 09:38.780
I looked the bird over,
after a short time returned it,

09:38.912 --> 09:41.199
and gave you a-a few sentences
describing it.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.493
And then I told you
to look at your bird again.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.207
I did as instructed,

09:45.335 --> 09:47.452
returned with a four-page essay.

09:47.587 --> 09:51.797
"Look at your bird again," you
told me and sent me away again.

09:53.885 --> 09:56.844
I spent three more days
looking at that starling.

09:56.971 --> 10:00.305
By that time, the poor thing
was beginning to molt.

10:00.433 --> 10:05.519
It was only then that you stated
I had finally seen my bird.

10:06.856 --> 10:10.020
It wasn't <i>what</i> you learned
in class, Laszlo.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.268
It's <i>how</i> you learned it.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.364
I now find myself
in circumstances

10:17.492 --> 10:22.112
where I'm afraid...
I only see what I see.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.450
Even if I might be contradicted,

10:24.582 --> 10:28.622
I seem only able to recite that
which is already known to me.

10:30.046 --> 10:35.838
Much to my dismay, theory seems
to have replaced pragmatism.

10:39.347 --> 10:43.307
Can you suggest to me
what might I do?

10:47.272 --> 10:49.639
Look at your bird, Laszlo.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.059
Look at your bird.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.327
My, my.

11:03.454 --> 11:08.040
If this country isn't going
to heaven in a wheelbarrow.

11:11.171 --> 11:15.006
And to think,
the man is a doctor.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.882
You don't look well, John.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.507
I hope it isn't another hangover
that's troubling you.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.603
Good Lord.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.815
I will never get used
to that machine.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.729
I would much rather speak
in person

11:37.864 --> 11:42.609
than have my inner ear assaulted
by some stranger's tongue.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.360
What? Who was it?

11:44.495 --> 11:46.452
You... You look like you've seen
a ghost.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.050
I suppose you'll tell me
at some point

12:00.178 --> 12:04.673
why you're taking me to this
godforsaken penitentiary.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.049
You proved yourself useful
at Bellevue.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.598
And you thought I could be
useful again?

12:09.729 --> 12:13.564
I told you before, John, people
like you more than they do me.

12:13.691 --> 12:17.059
And it might be... challenging.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.982
So tell me... Why are we going?

12:19.822 --> 12:21.654
Hildebrandt's starling.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.323
What?

12:25.662 --> 12:28.405
We're going to see
Jesse Pomeroy.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.500
Jesse Pomeroy?

12:33.628 --> 12:36.587
The Boston Boy Fiend?

12:41.761 --> 12:43.923
- Don't be anxious.
- I'm not anxious.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.756
I've quit drinking is all.

13:14.043 --> 13:18.162
Keep away from the cells and say
nothing to the prisoners.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.981
You got 20 minutes.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.955
You behave yourself, now, Jesse.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.578
Or you know what'll happen.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.685
Hello, Jesse.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.152
Do you remember me?

14:26.032 --> 14:28.240
My name is Dr. Kreizler.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.954
We met many years ago.

14:35.083 --> 14:38.201
You'd just been imprisoned
for the first time.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.460
I was hoping you'd let me
ask you some questions

14:47.595 --> 14:48.927
about the children.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.921
That's why they interrupted
my dinner?

14:51.057 --> 14:53.424
So you could interrogate me
again?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.931
So you do remember me.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.477
I'd like to measure
your progress.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.315
I've been in solitary
confinement for 22 years.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.903
You call that progress?

15:07.031 --> 15:09.990
Some would say you're lucky
to have escaped the gallows.

15:10.118 --> 15:13.782
Oh, would you say that?
Would you say I'm lucky?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.495
Or just insane?

15:16.082 --> 15:19.792
I never considered you mad
for killing those children,

15:19.919 --> 15:23.287
not even for that what
you'd done to them afterward.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.131
On the contrary,
it was quite understandable.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.251
Understandable?

15:29.053 --> 15:32.797
There's evidence to suggest
you were driven to kill by...

15:32.932 --> 15:34.423
something as simple as envy.

15:35.852 --> 15:36.968
Now, listen to this.

15:37.103 --> 15:40.221
He thinks because I got
a bum eye,

15:40.356 --> 15:41.716
I run around
cutting up little kids

15:41.816 --> 15:43.352
just 'cause they gots
two good ones.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.811
If it <i>is</i> just envy, Doctor,

15:46.946 --> 15:49.780
why aren't you out there
chopping off people's arms?

15:54.537 --> 15:56.403
See?
I remember.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.163
I remember about that arm
of yours.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.628
Yes, I do.

16:04.755 --> 16:05.962
Yes, I do.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.628
Well, let me ask you
one question, Jesse.

16:14.390 --> 16:18.600
The mutilations of the face...
especially their eyes,

16:18.728 --> 16:20.594
meant nothing?

16:20.730 --> 16:22.722
Merely a random act of violence?

16:22.857 --> 16:25.850
There's nothing what you
would call a good reason

16:25.985 --> 16:28.728
for what happened to those kids.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.153
I-I just had enough.
That's it.

16:34.285 --> 16:35.366
I had to stop it.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.952
Stop what?

16:42.043 --> 16:42.877
Jesse?

16:42.878 --> 16:46.245
Yeah, I seen
them little bastards...

16:46.380 --> 16:49.293
standing there...

16:49.425 --> 16:53.089
licking a piece of candy
or eating a drop cake,

16:53.221 --> 16:55.713
staring at me like I was
some animal in a cage.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.841
Only I wasn't in a cage.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.808
Not then, anyway.

17:01.812 --> 17:05.146
There wasn't anything keeping me
from doing what I had to do.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.108
I know how I look.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.315
Yeah, my... my father...

17:14.450 --> 17:17.693
he couldn't stand the sight
of me, and he runs off.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.821
My dear mother.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.290
She never kissed my face.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.039
Not... Not even once.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.057
It's all right, Jesse.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.453
What, you believe me, Doctor?

18:09.589 --> 18:10.589
You really think...

18:10.590 --> 18:13.333
You really think I killed
those kids because...

18:13.467 --> 18:16.881
because my mother never kissed
my ugly face?

18:23.311 --> 18:25.678
You got it figured out
why I cut 'em up?!

18:25.813 --> 18:28.146
- Guard!
- Flayed their skin?

18:28.274 --> 18:30.516
You got it figured out
why I cut them up?

18:30.651 --> 18:32.688
Flayed their skin?

18:35.031 --> 18:36.613
Guard!

18:37.700 --> 18:40.693
Pretty little eyes?
Huh?!

18:40.828 --> 18:42.410
- Drop it!
- Aah!

18:44.415 --> 18:48.159
You'll never know!

18:48.294 --> 18:49.294
Only I'll know!

18:49.420 --> 18:52.629
Only Jesse Pomeroy!

18:52.757 --> 18:55.124
You'll never know!

19:25.748 --> 19:28.912
I must have dozed off a moment.

19:31.837 --> 19:35.922
I don't suppose you got
what you'd hoped from Jesse.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.922
Perhaps the truth.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.805
That I don't know as much
as I think I do.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.709
Hello, Theodore.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.671
Mayor.

20:23.806 --> 20:26.173
Beautiful morning for a ride.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.183
It was.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.677
I have not heard from you
directly

20:30.813 --> 20:33.556
since the awful events
of Castle Garden.

20:41.574 --> 20:45.784
My only source of news...
is the papers I read.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.278
I urge you to ignore the press,
Mayor.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.934
Truth rarely makes for
a good headline.

20:49.999 --> 20:53.618
Just remember... The 400
are too important to this city

20:53.753 --> 20:55.039
to suffer the public humiliation

20:55.171 --> 20:57.584
of having one of their own
arrested for murder.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.609
I'm afraid I've no idea
what you're talking about.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.592
I'm talking about the fact
that there's been suspicion cast

21:02.720 --> 21:04.962
on a member
of a certain family...

21:05.097 --> 21:07.259
a most important family.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.223
They have come to me
in hopes that the matter

21:09.351 --> 21:11.559
can be attended to privately.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.223
If the matter
is murdered children,

21:13.355 --> 21:15.813
then it will be attended to
in accordance with the law.

21:15.941 --> 21:19.400
Just as you're aware of who put
you in your position, Theodore,

21:19.528 --> 21:22.566
I am aware of who put me
in mine.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.860
The papers may be rife
with falsehoods,

21:24.992 --> 21:28.110
but they can sow the seeds
of discontent.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.446
What would you have me do?

21:32.583 --> 21:34.996
Let the family take care of it.

21:37.213 --> 21:38.579
Are we clear?

21:43.803 --> 21:45.795
Clear we are, Mayor.

21:46.597 --> 21:48.554
Clear we are.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.427
Charlie.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.721
Ho! Look out.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.565
Yah!

22:08.077 --> 22:12.242
"Horizontal laceration...

22:12.957 --> 22:16.871
...eight inches
across upper abdomen...

22:17.461 --> 22:19.703
...entrails removed..."

22:19.839 --> 22:21.839
Enough to put you off
your lunch, isn't it?

22:23.175 --> 22:25.883
My appetite's quite good,
thank you.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.877
Is the commissioner in?
We have an appointment.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.345
He's with Captain Connor.

22:37.898 --> 22:39.230
I do have a question.

22:41.235 --> 22:45.229
How exactly does the sex act
occur between a man and a boy?

22:47.533 --> 22:50.867
There can be an assault
upon the oral and anal passages,

22:50.995 --> 22:53.282
of course,
as between a man and a woman.

22:53.414 --> 22:54.780
Of course.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.326
Or manual stimulation,

22:56.458 --> 22:58.916
perhaps even during the
commission of the murder itself.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.749
Onanism in place of coitus.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.522
Some men find it's the only way
to achieve

23:04.550 --> 23:06.633
a satisfactory ejaculation.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.421
I can understand
self-gratification for a woman,

23:11.557 --> 23:13.924
but for a mature man,
it seems contrary to nature.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.266
Oh, I wholeheartedly agree.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.602
I mean, for a man to turn
to self-pollution...

23:19.440 --> 23:20.806
I once knew a nurse in training.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.557
- Oy, gevalt.
- Did you, now?

23:22.693 --> 23:24.309
Yes, but she failed her exams.

23:24.445 --> 23:26.325
They asked her how she would
bathe the genitals,

23:26.405 --> 23:29.489
and she said, "Why, the same way
I'd bathe the Jews."

23:29.617 --> 23:31.108
That is enough!

23:31.243 --> 23:33.485
I want the name and I want it
now, Captain Connor.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.237
We have no suspects
in these crimes, sir.

23:35.372 --> 23:36.863
I wish I could say different.

23:36.999 --> 23:39.616
No person of means has come to
the attention of the department?

23:39.752 --> 23:40.628
No, sir!

23:45.382 --> 23:48.125
I will not tolerate
a concealment of facts, Captain.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.626
If a crime has been committed,

23:49.762 --> 23:52.425
every effort will be made
to apprehend the perpetrator.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.513
I care not a whit
about his social standing.

23:54.642 --> 23:57.601
Yes, sir, and I share
your sentiment, Commissioner.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.319
You wanted to see us, sir?

24:08.447 --> 24:11.281
Yes. Come in.
I have something for you.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.443
Miss Howard, please join us.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.992
They've just come in.

24:20.376 --> 24:23.790
They'll be standard issue for
every officer in the department.

24:25.089 --> 24:27.049
Colt double-action.
Excellent choice, sir.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.175
Please go
straightaway to the target range

24:30.302 --> 24:32.965
and familiarize yourself
with your weapons.

24:33.097 --> 24:34.588
Thank you, Commissioner.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.471
Miss Howard.

24:48.654 --> 24:52.193
It's come to my attention
the police may have a suspect,

24:52.324 --> 24:55.488
but Kreizler's investigation
seems to be lagging.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.365
I want you to comb through
police records

24:58.497 --> 25:00.705
to see if someone of means
presents themselves

25:00.833 --> 25:04.622
by their actions as...
worthy of suspicion.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.648
As you know, sir,
there is good reason to believe

25:06.672 --> 25:08.789
that the killer does come from
privilege.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.040
Mr. Moore found out as much

25:10.175 --> 25:11.837
when he visited the brothel
Paresis Hall.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.551
Yes.

25:13.679 --> 25:16.046
I'm well aware that privilege
has powerful allies

25:16.181 --> 25:17.217
within the department.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.386
So please be careful.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.210
Miss Howard.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.254
I hope I'm not interrupting.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.673
It seems you're making a habit
of surprises,

25:56.805 --> 25:58.842
albeit pleasant ones.

25:59.850 --> 26:00.850
Won't you sit down?

26:00.851 --> 26:02.387
I think not.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.727
I only came here on the
instruction of the commissioner.

26:04.855 --> 26:07.063
I'm to inform you
the police have a suspect.

26:08.609 --> 26:11.272
Roosevelt is asking for
your help to identify him.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.235
I'd very much like it
if you would join me.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.408
Please.

26:18.535 --> 26:21.073
Only on the condition that
you fabricate no more stories

26:21.205 --> 26:24.243
about distraught mothers
and their waterlogged children.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.455
I give you my word.

26:33.342 --> 26:34.924
Thank you.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.685
Is the wine not satisfactory?

26:53.821 --> 26:56.108
It's delicious.

26:56.657 --> 26:59.616
- You're not being truthful.
- The truth is I prefer whiskey.

26:59.743 --> 27:00.904
Ah.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.828
Bring the lady a whiskey,
please.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.243
- Yes, sir.
- Please make it two.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.786
Of course.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.796
I was raised by my father
as an only child.

27:12.923 --> 27:15.165
He taught me to drink whiskey.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.922
He said if I was to endeavor
to live in a man's world,

27:19.054 --> 27:22.047
then it was necessary for me
to learn to drink like a man.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.969
I must admit, however,
it took me years

27:24.101 --> 27:25.933
to accustom myself to the taste.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.597
What else did your father
teach you?

27:27.729 --> 27:29.391
To ride, to shoot,

27:29.523 --> 27:31.515
to live without fear
of my own convictions.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.188
I don't know about horseflesh
or firearms,

27:34.319 --> 27:37.027
but it appears he's done
rather well with the latter.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.193
Are you sure you won't
have anything to eat?

27:39.324 --> 27:40.324
No, thank you.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.675
Is it not satisfactory?

28:17.196 --> 28:20.280
Her grandfather came
from a village outside Minsk.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.275
Tell her.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.286
Um, I never met him.

28:26.413 --> 28:28.871
He died before I was born.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.206
My parents met here.

28:30.751 --> 28:33.368
Just like us, Mama,
she has ties to the old country.

28:33.503 --> 28:35.995
I'm curious about your names.

28:36.131 --> 28:39.590
I don't recall a Marcus
or Lucius in the Old Testament.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.478
- Shakespeare.
- Shakespeare?

28:41.595 --> 28:44.713
Our parents were just arrived
in this country.

28:44.848 --> 28:47.761
In order to learn English, they
took to reading Shakespeare.

28:47.893 --> 28:48.893
Or trying to.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.814
They were halfway
through "Julius Caesar"

28:50.896 --> 28:52.262
when we were born.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.167
They didn't want their children
to be subjected

28:54.191 --> 28:55.477
to any anti-Jewish feelings,

28:55.609 --> 28:57.646
hence we were named after
characters in the play.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.606
That's a wonderful story,
Mrs. Isaacson.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.455
What more can you tell me
about the suspect?

29:10.582 --> 29:12.790
The commissioner only stated
that he comes from wealth

29:12.918 --> 29:14.250
and privilege

29:14.378 --> 29:16.022
and that I should try and see
if police records

29:16.046 --> 29:18.129
might help to identify him
by his actions.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.251
I discovered several complaints

29:20.384 --> 29:21.984
regarding improper behavior
with children

29:22.094 --> 29:24.131
approximately the same age
as our victims.

29:24.263 --> 29:27.006
I found these two to be
of most interest...

29:27.140 --> 29:29.302
a young man, age 29, unmarried,

29:29.434 --> 29:31.596
volunteers his time
at children's charities.

29:31.728 --> 29:34.812
On both complaints, the name of
the accused had been redacted.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.899
Ex-Chief Byrnes' influence,
I have no doubt.

29:38.026 --> 29:40.143
I also found this name.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.526
Bishop Henry Potter?

29:44.658 --> 29:46.820
On that redacted document,
he stated after the fact

29:46.952 --> 29:49.444
that there had been
some sort of misunderstanding,

29:49.579 --> 29:50.974
that the young man
accused of assault

29:50.998 --> 29:53.490
had merely been engaged
in a bit of roughhouse.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.906
You're suggesting that the head
of the Episcopal Church...

29:55.961 --> 29:59.125
Roughhouse that sent the boy
involved to the hospital.

29:59.256 --> 30:01.464
While it's too early to draw
conclusions, Miss Howard,

30:01.591 --> 30:03.503
I must compliment you
on your police work.

30:04.094 --> 30:06.211
I suppose I should be grateful
at the suggestion

30:06.346 --> 30:08.008
that what I'm doing
is police work.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.631
Searching out these records

30:09.766 --> 30:11.723
and drawing quite convincing
inferences

30:11.852 --> 30:14.094
is certainly worthy of the term.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.186
Commissioner Roosevelt
might disagree with you.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.898
I find Commissioner Roosevelt
capable of disagreeing

30:19.026 --> 30:21.234
with most people on most things.

30:21.361 --> 30:22.977
You're of similar temperament,
then.

30:25.324 --> 30:29.568
If I were to disagree with you,
it would only prove your point.

30:30.787 --> 30:33.120
Given your knowledge
and experience,

30:33.248 --> 30:36.537
perhaps instead I should say you
are stubborn and intractable.

30:39.004 --> 30:40.370
Intractable?

30:40.505 --> 30:42.246
You have a gift for it.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.008
Please excuse me, Doctor.

30:51.308 --> 30:53.345
I have more work to do.

31:16.375 --> 31:21.211
Red Rover, Red Rover,
send James over!

31:30.389 --> 31:34.850
Red Rover, Red Rover,
send the bishop over!

31:34.976 --> 31:36.763
Oh!

31:36.895 --> 31:38.181
Hold tight.

31:38.313 --> 31:39.645
Whoa!

31:46.738 --> 31:48.445
That took the wind
right out of my sails.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.439
You children go on without me.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.739
My name is Laszlo Kreizler.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.655
I believe we have
a mutual acquaintance

31:57.791 --> 31:59.828
in Theodore Roosevelt.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.919
A friend of a friend
is my friend.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.959
You seem to have many friends...

32:06.091 --> 32:08.174
and some very important ones
at that.

32:08.301 --> 32:10.588
What can I do for you,
Mr. Kreizler?

32:10.720 --> 32:12.712
Dr. Kreizler.

32:12.848 --> 32:14.180
Perhaps you've heard

32:14.307 --> 32:16.924
there have been a number of boys
murdered down in the tenements.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.302
I read the papers
like everyone else.

32:19.438 --> 32:23.057
I'm here to inquire after
a member of your congregation,

32:23.191 --> 32:26.684
one who's had a troubled history
with the police.

32:26.820 --> 32:29.733
I'm afraid I'm unaware of anyone
who fits that description.

32:29.865 --> 32:32.778
Perhaps... this enlightens you.

32:35.620 --> 32:40.206
Red Rover, Red Rover,
send Matthew over!

32:42.627 --> 32:45.290
That is your name mentioned,
is it not?

32:47.591 --> 32:50.504
I haven't seen the young man
in a number of years.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.252
He lived a life of the flesh.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.380
Last I heard, Mrs. Van Bergen...

32:55.515 --> 32:59.509
Red Rover, Red Rover,
send Henry over!

32:59.644 --> 33:03.012
Um... his mother had sent him off
to Switzerland

33:03.148 --> 33:06.186
to undergo what was termed
a rest cure.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.854
The complaint filed against him

33:07.986 --> 33:10.649
had to do with work he was doing
here at the church.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.897
A misunderstanding.

33:14.201 --> 33:17.865
He had volunteered to help with
the orphans we provide for.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.830
He's a passionate young man.

33:22.459 --> 33:24.746
Things were taken the wrong way.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.371
So you don't believe him capable
of murder?

33:30.175 --> 33:33.464
Red Rover, Red Rover,
send Gerald over!

33:33.595 --> 33:35.962
Let me ask you, Doctor.

33:36.097 --> 33:41.309
How would God distinguish
an alienist...

33:41.436 --> 33:45.180
from an alchemist or a...
spiritualist

33:45.315 --> 33:48.729
or someone who levitates tables
and talks to the dead?

33:48.860 --> 33:50.647
Psychology is a relatively new

33:50.779 --> 33:52.736
but well-respected field
of medicine.

33:52.864 --> 33:59.202
Without God, man's nature
is to seek not good, but evil.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.695
Everyone is born in sin.

34:01.831 --> 34:04.323
Salvation is required by all.

34:04.459 --> 34:06.496
And if the need for salvation
did not exist,

34:06.628 --> 34:10.212
the Church would surely find
its invention necessary.

34:23.311 --> 34:26.145
That is a beautiful calendar,
Bishop.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.059
May I ask you...

34:31.194 --> 34:34.402
What's the importance
of the 19th of February?

34:34.531 --> 34:36.898
It was Ash Wednesday.

34:40.203 --> 34:42.114
"Dirt and Paint."

34:42.246 --> 34:45.114
I beg your pardon?

34:45.250 --> 34:47.492
Growing up Catholic,
I should have known.

34:47.627 --> 34:51.462
One last question...
Was Willem devout?

34:51.590 --> 34:56.630
As I said,
he lived a life of the flesh.

35:17.991 --> 35:19.607
"On February 19th,

35:19.743 --> 35:23.111
I seen your boy parading himself
outside the church...

35:25.206 --> 35:28.495
...with dirt and paint
on his face.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.416
I decided to wait...

35:32.547 --> 35:34.163
and saw him several times

35:34.299 --> 35:38.339
before one night, I took him
away from that place."

35:52.942 --> 35:54.433
Whoa!

36:04.663 --> 36:07.827
- Do you have a name?
- You won't like it.

36:07.957 --> 36:10.791
I don't like anything about this
to begin with.

36:15.215 --> 36:16.672
Willem Van Bergen.

36:17.634 --> 36:19.250
Van Bergen?

36:20.845 --> 36:22.211
Are you certain?

36:23.848 --> 36:26.682
I'm certain a wealthy
and socially prominent couple

36:26.810 --> 36:28.927
have a son of dubious character

36:29.062 --> 36:31.395
who shares any number of traits
with our killer.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.890
Makes sense, then, that I was
warned to look the other way

36:34.025 --> 36:35.937
by the mayor himself.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.113
Then I suggest you do
what the mayor says

36:41.241 --> 36:42.698
and look the other way.

36:42.826 --> 36:44.658
What are you saying?

36:45.203 --> 36:47.195
Van Bergen is not our killer.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.577
And how did you reach
that conclusion?

36:50.709 --> 36:52.701
A visit to a church
in the Five Points,

36:52.836 --> 36:55.328
one Giorgio Santorelli
might have attended.

36:55.463 --> 36:57.546
The congregation was made up
of poor immigrants,

36:57.674 --> 37:00.667
a world away from Bishop Potter
and his golden-haired choirboys.

37:00.802 --> 37:02.168
That doesn't answer my question.

37:02.303 --> 37:05.341
The killer is choosing victims
who somehow remind him

37:05.473 --> 37:08.841
of his own background
and upbringing, his own class.

37:08.977 --> 37:11.219
I almost believe you don't want
the killer found...

37:11.938 --> 37:14.806
...that this is nothing more
for you than an exercise

37:14.941 --> 37:16.432
or an examination
of the human mind.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.685
You asked my help
in providing you with a name,

37:18.820 --> 37:19.820
and I've done so.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.778
Now, that's all.

37:27.412 --> 37:31.782
This is not a classroom or one
of your laboratory experiments.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.532
This man is killing children

37:33.668 --> 37:36.001
in a most cold-blooded
and horrific way,

37:36.129 --> 37:39.247
and no amount of theorizing
is going to stop him.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.920
It's time to take action.

37:48.975 --> 37:52.719
I wonder why he bothers
playing at all.

37:52.854 --> 37:56.473
Captain Connor,
I'd like a word with you.

38:04.365 --> 38:07.449
Okay, lads.
Let's have another game.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.166
What do you know
of a Willem Van Bergen?

38:20.298 --> 38:21.880
I, uh...

38:22.008 --> 38:25.843
I-I know the Van Bergen name,
sir, but...

38:27.180 --> 38:29.172
...everyone in the city
knows that name.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.391
You're unaware he had complaints
filed against him?

38:32.519 --> 38:34.431
I mean,
we've a thousand complaints

38:34.562 --> 38:37.054
a day filed, Commissioner.

38:37.190 --> 38:39.807
You don't expect me
to know all of them?

38:49.160 --> 38:51.994
You keep your office very neat,
Captain.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.165
Yes, sir.

38:58.461 --> 39:00.373
Thank you, sir.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.838
I want you to discreetly find
the whereabouts

39:02.966 --> 39:04.707
of Willem Van Bergen.

39:07.804 --> 39:09.761
I want an address.

39:24.529 --> 39:27.146
I've never had a milk bath
before.

39:45.884 --> 39:48.126
What happened to your teeth?

39:48.261 --> 39:50.378
Too much candy.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.093
Commissioner Roosevelt.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.307
Are the men ready?

39:56.436 --> 39:57.893
More than ready.

39:59.606 --> 40:01.973
- Sir?
- Let's be on our way, then.

40:02.108 --> 40:04.896
You're coming with us?
It might be dangerous.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.653
Well, Commissioner, you
personally going to arrest

40:07.780 --> 40:09.237
a rich degenerate
like Van Bergen

40:09.365 --> 40:11.402
would surely draw the attention
of the press.

40:11.534 --> 40:12.775
That's why I asked you to keep

40:12.911 --> 40:15.995
your search for his whereabouts
confidential, Captain.

40:16.122 --> 40:18.455
I feel the city owes the family
that much.

40:19.792 --> 40:21.283
All right!
Come on!

40:38.019 --> 40:41.228
Move! Out of the way!

40:45.777 --> 40:47.484
Yah!

41:04.837 --> 41:07.124
Move! Move! Out of the way!

41:10.134 --> 41:12.842
Yah!

41:17.183 --> 41:19.641
Come on, lads! Go! Go! Go!

41:50.883 --> 41:52.169
You're mine now.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.803
Wait here, Captain.
Let me do this.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.266
Who's that?

42:10.611 --> 42:12.523
Open the door!
This is the police!

42:19.620 --> 42:20.952
Willem Van Bergen,
open the door!

42:21.080 --> 42:22.912
This is the police!

42:32.550 --> 42:34.212
Mother.

42:34.844 --> 42:36.551
Excuse me, madam.

42:36.679 --> 42:38.295
Who might you be?

42:39.557 --> 42:41.014
Miss Effie.

42:43.853 --> 42:47.267
Why didn't you answer
when I knocked?

42:47.398 --> 42:49.731
Deal with the boy.

42:52.945 --> 42:55.153
Can I... keep the dress?

42:55.281 --> 42:57.864
You can't do this.
You cannot do this!

42:57.992 --> 43:00.405
You're Mr. Roosevelt,
aren't you?

43:00.995 --> 43:04.113
I am.
Do you live here, Miss Effie?

43:04.248 --> 43:08.333
Yes, sir.
Twenty-six years.

43:08.461 --> 43:11.875
Please excuse us.
There's been some confusion.

43:12.882 --> 43:15.795
This is not the right place,
Commissioner?

43:23.434 --> 43:26.097
Have a lovely evening, ma'am.

43:30.108 --> 43:31.440
Captain Connor!

43:32.276 --> 43:33.858
Sir!

43:33.986 --> 43:35.978
We'll need to leave here.

43:37.198 --> 43:38.439
I don't want to go.

43:38.574 --> 43:40.691
I know, precious.
I know.

43:42.161 --> 43:43.993
You cannot make me.

43:44.122 --> 43:47.581
It's all right.
It's just for a little while.

43:55.758 --> 43:58.375
Oh, my Willem.

43:58.511 --> 43:59.877
My good, good boy.

44:00.012 --> 44:01.548
No!

44:02.265 --> 44:03.597
No!

44:03.724 --> 44:05.932
No! No!

44:17.905 --> 44:19.396
I want you to know,
Commissioner,

44:19.532 --> 44:21.444
I paid good money
for that address.

44:21.576 --> 44:23.363
Good money.

44:24.871 --> 44:27.329
Apparently not good enough.

44:37.091 --> 44:38.832
Hand me your weapon.

44:41.971 --> 44:44.304
Give me your weapon!
Now!

44:52.023 --> 44:55.562
You're going to regret this,
Mr. Roosevelt.

45:08.915 --> 45:10.076
Let's go.

45:13.044 --> 45:15.206
Go!

45:37.276 --> 45:40.735
Every time you ring, you scare
the life out of my grandmother,

45:40.863 --> 45:42.695
especially late at night.

45:42.823 --> 45:44.906
I have to show you something.

45:46.327 --> 45:50.367
Humans are creatures of habit,
of traditions and customs.

45:50.498 --> 45:51.498
Therefore, it made sense

45:51.624 --> 45:53.786
that our killer might be
following a pattern.

45:53.918 --> 45:54.999
On January the 1st,

45:55.127 --> 45:58.541
an unidentified Negro boy
was found dead.

46:01.259 --> 46:03.091
Aaron Morton's body
was discovered

46:03.219 --> 46:06.257
hanging from the Brooklyn Bridge
on the 2nd of February.

46:08.474 --> 46:12.969
Giorgio Santorelli's body
was found on the 3rd of March.

46:13.104 --> 46:16.142
But then Ali ibn-Ghazi
was killed on the 3rd of April,

46:16.274 --> 46:18.231
and the numerical pattern
was broken.

46:18.359 --> 46:21.693
I have to admit
I was quite disheartened.

46:21.821 --> 46:24.780
But in the letter
sent to Mrs. Santorelli,

46:24.907 --> 46:27.900
our killer mentions
seeing Giorgio outside a church

46:28.035 --> 46:29.446
on the 19th of February,

46:29.578 --> 46:32.787
"parading himself with dirt
and paint on his face."

46:32.915 --> 46:35.874
It wasn't until I realized what
was meant by "dirt and paint"

46:36.002 --> 46:37.664
that it started to make sense.

46:37.795 --> 46:39.206
Ash Wednesday.

46:41.090 --> 46:42.956
They're all holy days.

46:44.969 --> 46:46.801
He's following
the Christian calendar.

46:46.929 --> 46:49.967
The next holy day
is the 14th of May.

46:52.351 --> 46:54.843
The Feast of the Ascension.

46:54.979 --> 46:57.221
Just a few days from now.

46:58.232 --> 46:59.473
Yes.
