WEBVTT

03:14.165 --> 03:15.375
Over there!

03:20.255 --> 03:21.464
Hmm.

03:22.257 --> 03:24.300
Bring the torches!
We need light!

03:24.968 --> 03:26.219
Find him!

03:29.389 --> 03:31.474
- Check the barn!
- We need more!

03:32.684 --> 03:33.810
Over here!

03:36.896 --> 03:38.022
Down there.

03:45.155 --> 03:46.197
He's gone that way!

03:46.281 --> 03:48.241
Floki has escaped,
King Ragnar.

03:48.324 --> 03:49.534
Of course he has.

03:49.617 --> 03:50.869
This way!

03:54.122 --> 03:55.290
Well...

03:56.332 --> 03:57.542
Go find him.

04:53.223 --> 04:55.558
Your Highness.

04:56.100 --> 04:59.938
We have some unexpected
and urgent news from Mercia.

05:00.021 --> 05:03.691
We have heard
that several leading
Mercian nobles,

05:04.275 --> 05:06.027
refusing to pay
homage to us,

05:06.110 --> 05:08.780
have risen in revolt
against Queen Kwenthrith,

05:09.364 --> 05:10.573
and overthrown her.

05:10.657 --> 05:13.284
As far as we know,
she and her son Magnus

05:13.368 --> 05:15.537
have been imprisoned
in a tower somewhere.

05:15.745 --> 05:17.872
Meanwhile,
these rebel nobles

05:17.956 --> 05:20.458
have set themselves up
as a Ruling Council!

05:21.042 --> 05:24.212
This flagrant abuse of our
last treaty with Mercia

05:24.295 --> 05:26.839
cannot and will
not be tolerated.

05:27.048 --> 05:30.969
I've already sent
word to King Aelle,
our ally, summoning him here.

05:31.094 --> 05:36.266
It may be that this time
we will have to use force
to overcome Mercia.

05:36.349 --> 05:38.101
But not before we have
made a last attempt

05:38.184 --> 05:40.478
to rescue
the Queen and her son.

05:40.603 --> 05:42.772
You will have to
find the tower first!
Yes.

05:42.981 --> 05:45.692
My Lord, we have already
dispatched scouts.

05:45.984 --> 05:47.360
We await their report.

05:47.485 --> 05:49.779
In the meantime,
we charge you all
to give warning.

05:49.862 --> 05:51.906
Summon your men
and your supporters to arms.

05:52.031 --> 05:54.576
But if, Prince,
they may well not be needed,

05:54.659 --> 05:57.161
it would be a great
and unnecessary expense

05:58.079 --> 06:01.082
to keep good men
idle and at arms.

06:01.165 --> 06:03.084
Whatever the expense,
my Lord,

06:03.167 --> 06:04.544
it is surely
better to be ready

06:04.627 --> 06:05.920
to seize
the moment when it arrives,

06:06.004 --> 06:08.172
rather than see
it wasted and gone.

06:08.256 --> 06:09.424
You are
a king's son,

06:09.507 --> 06:12.135
what do you know about
the burdens of expense?

06:13.344 --> 06:14.637
My Lords,

06:14.929 --> 06:20.768
you talk as if it
were an expensive luxury
to keep a standing army.

06:22.020 --> 06:24.564
But I warn you,
it is rather a necessity,

06:25.189 --> 06:27.358
for Ragnar Lothbrok,
or others just like him,

06:27.442 --> 06:30.695
could return to these
shores at any moment!

06:31.738 --> 06:34.782
I beg you,
cease your quarrels.

06:35.908 --> 06:39.537
We are talking about
the destiny of Wessex!

07:35.093 --> 07:36.719
Did you free Floki, Helga?

07:39.514 --> 07:41.766
I don't know.
I might have done.

07:47.855 --> 07:50.066
Angrboda, come.

07:55.029 --> 07:56.447
I don't blame you.

07:58.825 --> 08:01.786
It is your duty as a wife.

08:05.206 --> 08:06.541
Floki loves you.

08:06.749 --> 08:08.084
He only loves himself.

08:13.798 --> 08:15.633
You know that
better than anyone.

08:23.141 --> 08:24.559
Winter is coming.

08:24.976 --> 08:26.269
Whatever happens,

08:28.062 --> 08:30.732
you and your child
will need to eat.

08:31.941 --> 08:32.984
It's food.

08:50.084 --> 08:51.002
Two flanks!

08:52.086 --> 08:54.088
Three! Back!

08:54.172 --> 08:55.548
Get those gates open!

08:55.840 --> 08:57.008
High!

08:57.258 --> 08:59.260
Two, watch your flanks!

08:59.343 --> 09:01.512
Three! Retrieve!

09:03.848 --> 09:05.433
Make way for the King!

09:15.485 --> 09:16.903
Our Mercian scouts.

09:19.989 --> 09:20.990
All of them?

09:21.073 --> 09:22.575
Soldier approaching!

09:31.876 --> 09:33.753
You know where
the tower is?
Yes.

09:35.129 --> 09:36.380
And you can
lead us there?

09:37.548 --> 09:38.674
Who told you?

09:38.800 --> 09:39.884
I don't know.

09:40.551 --> 09:41.928
Then how can
you trust him?

09:42.053 --> 09:43.221
He was a nobleman.

09:43.554 --> 09:45.556
He told me he refused to
join the Ruling Council.

09:46.057 --> 09:47.183
What was his name?

09:47.266 --> 09:49.519
- I only knew him as "W."
- "W"?

09:49.852 --> 09:51.103
Yes, Sire.

09:51.229 --> 09:52.563
And still you trust him?

09:53.064 --> 09:54.190
Yes.

09:55.274 --> 09:57.735
Of course he's a member
of the Ruling Council.

09:58.444 --> 10:00.112
They're using
Kwenthrith as bait.

10:00.238 --> 10:01.239
It's obvious.

10:01.405 --> 10:02.406
It's obvious to you.

10:03.908 --> 10:05.076
What does that mean?

10:05.201 --> 10:06.536
Well, it's the way
you think.

10:06.619 --> 10:08.371
Not everyone
thinks like you, Father.

10:09.580 --> 10:12.250
Then you are prepared
to trust this man's word,

10:12.375 --> 10:14.418
and go with him to Mercia?

10:31.102 --> 10:33.271
You go with some of
our best warriors.

10:33.980 --> 10:36.107
God also goes
with you, my son.

10:37.108 --> 10:38.276
And...

10:38.776 --> 10:42.071
If you have any cause
to doubt the honesty
of your scout,

10:42.446 --> 10:44.282
then think
as I would think.

10:44.407 --> 10:46.158
And kill him,
without conscience.

10:46.284 --> 10:48.035
I will bear your
advice in mind, Father.

10:48.119 --> 10:50.621
And, whatever else,

10:51.789 --> 10:52.999
save the son!

10:53.624 --> 10:54.792
Save Magnus.

10:57.837 --> 10:59.130
Mount up!

10:59.297 --> 11:00.631
Well, farewell, wife.

11:01.757 --> 11:02.967
Now I trust you again,

11:03.968 --> 11:05.469
our parting
feels less sorrowful.

11:06.470 --> 11:07.597
Let's go!

11:07.763 --> 11:08.848
Move out!

11:34.665 --> 11:35.833
What is wrong?

11:37.460 --> 11:39.503
I have just seen my husband

11:39.879 --> 11:42.048
ride away into
the greatest danger.

11:42.882 --> 11:44.634
Judith, whatever
happens, I...

11:44.759 --> 11:46.510
Just because you are King,

11:47.678 --> 11:50.473
you must not presume
that things will
go on as before.

11:51.223 --> 11:52.850
I never assume anything.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.522
After all, you cannot
force me to share your bed.

11:59.523 --> 12:03.069
Well, I would not
dream of forcing you.

12:03.694 --> 12:07.198
Force is only necessary
against one's enemies.

12:08.532 --> 12:09.700
And besides,

12:11.035 --> 12:12.703
I want you to be free.

12:16.707 --> 12:17.750
Free?

12:18.751 --> 12:19.877
Yes.

12:20.753 --> 12:22.546
Not just protected...

12:24.048 --> 12:25.174
But free.

12:26.550 --> 12:27.677
To be yourself.

12:27.927 --> 12:30.221
I can imagine that
you have never been free

12:30.346 --> 12:32.056
in your whole life.

12:32.264 --> 12:33.683
Not since you were born.

12:35.726 --> 12:38.104
Being a Princess
made it all the worse.

12:39.897 --> 12:41.524
You've lived
in a gilded cage.

12:42.566 --> 12:46.570
But a cage all the same.

12:48.572 --> 12:49.615
It's true.

12:52.868 --> 12:55.204
I was not free to
choose my husband.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.873
You might have
chosen otherwise?

13:00.459 --> 13:01.502
Possibly.

13:01.585 --> 13:04.630
And do you
suppose any other Prince

13:04.755 --> 13:06.757
would have
allowed you to be free?

13:09.135 --> 13:12.596
So, when you say "free,"

13:14.181 --> 13:15.433
what is it you mean?

13:16.767 --> 13:19.311
How can I be free?

13:28.279 --> 13:29.488
Let me...

13:29.822 --> 13:32.324
Let me ask you
something, Judith.

13:35.369 --> 13:37.121
What do you really want?

13:37.371 --> 13:40.833
What do you
really want to do?

13:41.042 --> 13:43.294
If you were free
to choose,

13:44.545 --> 13:48.466
what would give you
the most pleasure
and satisfaction?

13:51.469 --> 13:53.471
Go on, say it.

13:54.013 --> 13:55.306
Whatever you're thinking.

13:59.643 --> 14:00.978
I'd like to be a painter,

14:02.646 --> 14:03.856
like Athelstan.

14:06.192 --> 14:07.359
Very well.

14:08.069 --> 14:12.323
Then I will find you
a great teacher
to instruct you.

14:15.826 --> 14:17.661
I don't believe you.
Why not?

14:17.828 --> 14:20.372
Because no woman
has ever been allowed

14:20.498 --> 14:23.834
to study or work
on the sacred texts.

14:35.012 --> 14:36.347
Check those ashes!

14:41.018 --> 14:42.353
It is still warm.

14:42.853 --> 14:44.855
He cannot be
far away from us.

14:44.939 --> 14:46.941
Maybe.

15:34.405 --> 15:38.117
Here and here.

15:41.620 --> 15:43.372
Two forts either
side of the river,

15:43.455 --> 15:45.666
to prevent the Vikings
sailing right up
to the city.

15:46.417 --> 15:49.920
But how does he mean
to prevent the boats
sailing past the forts?

15:50.004 --> 15:51.255
Ah.

16:12.610 --> 16:13.819
Yah.

16:16.447 --> 16:18.282
Good.
Good.

16:20.117 --> 16:21.452
We will build the forts.

16:34.798 --> 16:35.883
Boat.

16:37.468 --> 16:38.469
Shh.

16:40.471 --> 16:41.639
Shh.

16:45.142 --> 16:46.185
Ah.

16:48.479 --> 16:49.772
He's telling us
to build more boats

16:49.855 --> 16:52.149
capable of attacking
the Northmen
in the water.

16:52.566 --> 16:53.651
Hmm?

16:55.861 --> 16:56.987
Good.

16:59.031 --> 17:02.660
So, after today,
it seems I have two
reasons to be pleased.

17:03.160 --> 17:04.369
Firstly,

17:04.662 --> 17:08.248
Duke Rollo's sound
and interesting advice
for the protection of Paris.

17:09.124 --> 17:10.376
And then, secondly,

17:11.042 --> 17:13.503
Princess Gisla's
horror at marrying him.

17:16.507 --> 17:17.590
Mmm.

17:17.675 --> 17:20.176
I'm sure she will
soon seek to have
the marriage annulled,

17:21.178 --> 17:23.305
on the grounds that it was
never consummated...

17:23.513 --> 17:24.765
Whether that is true or not.

17:27.309 --> 17:28.602
I have to ask, Count,

17:29.520 --> 17:30.813
whether you are not bitter
that the Emperor

17:30.896 --> 17:33.148
is claiming all of
the credit for saving Paris?

17:34.024 --> 17:35.234
Of course.

17:36.193 --> 17:37.778
I confess the sight
of that little man

17:37.903 --> 17:39.446
basking in
the glow of his success

17:39.530 --> 17:41.115
makes me feel
physically ill.

17:42.241 --> 17:46.620
Especially when I recall
how cowardly he
was during the siege.

17:46.704 --> 17:48.038
You remember that,
don't you?

17:48.789 --> 17:51.166
Paris deserves
a much stronger,
braver Emperor.

17:56.338 --> 17:57.631
Let me drink to him.

18:05.556 --> 18:06.682
Tell me...

18:08.559 --> 18:11.729
Do you think that
his daughter is really
any braver than he is?

18:12.396 --> 18:13.439
What do you mean?

18:13.981 --> 18:15.733
She was brave enough
to fetch the Oriflamme.

18:15.899 --> 18:17.860
Your desire
clouded your judgment,

18:19.528 --> 18:21.989
for she is clearly
not what you
suppose her to be.

18:23.407 --> 18:24.867
And, frankly,

18:25.743 --> 18:27.870
a man brave
enough to be Emperor

18:28.078 --> 18:30.622
needs a consort with
real iron in her soul.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.344
This is more of a brute
than we have used before,

18:46.138 --> 18:47.723
and it will
hurt you more.

18:49.933 --> 18:51.060
Are you sure?

21:42.439 --> 21:44.107
He's up there! Get him!

21:44.233 --> 21:45.859
Hurry! After him!

21:57.120 --> 21:58.288
Where did he go?

21:58.413 --> 21:59.998
Where is he?
He was just here.

22:00.707 --> 22:01.875
I saw him.

22:20.185 --> 22:22.229
- Quick!
- Where did he go?

22:31.738 --> 22:33.073
He's here!

22:33.407 --> 22:34.616
He's here!

22:34.950 --> 22:36.201
Look! Down there!

22:38.370 --> 22:39.579
He's there! Jump in!

23:45.103 --> 23:46.313
Athelstan?

23:48.607 --> 23:49.649
Who?

23:51.318 --> 23:52.402
Who are you?

23:52.486 --> 23:56.615
My name is Prudentius
of Troyes in Frankia.

23:57.491 --> 24:00.243
I was told that
King Ecbert of Wessex

24:00.327 --> 24:03.246
required a teacher
of illumination.

24:06.166 --> 24:07.334
Do you know
anything of this?

24:09.795 --> 24:10.879
Yes.

24:12.047 --> 24:13.131
Yes.

24:13.548 --> 24:16.426
King Ecbert told me
he would ask for a teacher.

24:16.593 --> 24:18.512
I didn't
really believe him.

24:22.307 --> 24:24.893
May I ask who you are?

24:27.354 --> 24:30.232
I am the wife of
Prince Aethelwulf,

24:30.982 --> 24:32.234
King Ecbert's son.

24:34.069 --> 24:38.323
Then perhaps it is
one of your sons
who needs my services.

24:40.367 --> 24:42.828
Actually, it's not
one of my sons...

24:43.995 --> 24:45.122
It's me.

24:48.291 --> 24:50.168
That is...

24:50.669 --> 24:51.837
Not possible.

24:52.212 --> 24:53.338
What's not possible?

24:54.339 --> 24:56.091
To work on sacred texts.

24:56.800 --> 24:59.970
To teach the sacred
mysteries to a woman?

25:01.096 --> 25:02.556
It's what you
were hired for.

25:05.225 --> 25:06.393
Go and ask the King.

25:19.948 --> 25:21.825
The Count,
for all his jealousy,

25:22.325 --> 25:24.077
is impressed by
your Northman.

25:25.662 --> 25:27.456
Our new Duke Rollo.

25:31.084 --> 25:32.961
He spoke about
him a great deal.

25:34.504 --> 25:36.089
Did he speak
of anyone else?

25:39.676 --> 25:41.178
He spoke of the Emperor.

25:46.183 --> 25:47.517
Was he...

25:50.020 --> 25:51.021
Indiscreet?

25:56.610 --> 26:02.449
He talked of his
utter contempt
of the Emperor.

26:04.618 --> 26:06.119
Is that indiscreet?

26:08.955 --> 26:12.626
I must congratulate you
on extracting such
useful information,

26:14.377 --> 26:15.712
though, of course,

26:16.671 --> 26:19.674
I regret the price you
have to pay to get it.

26:21.384 --> 26:24.221
Now, see if you can find out
anything else about Odo,

26:26.014 --> 26:28.558
which will discredit him
in the Emperor's eyes.

26:30.018 --> 26:33.021
Then, when the time is right,

26:33.355 --> 26:35.732
I will inform His
Imperial Highness

26:35.857 --> 26:39.736
of the duplicity
and treachery

26:40.487 --> 26:44.241
of his high and
most trusted servant.

26:46.660 --> 26:47.911
And then?

26:48.912 --> 26:52.415
Then, let
the cards fall as they may.

27:02.509 --> 27:04.594
- No, no, no, keep...
- Keep, keep pouring.

27:04.761 --> 27:06.263
Thank you. Very good.

27:07.514 --> 27:09.266
It's very good.
Very good.

27:10.100 --> 27:11.768
Bishop Edmund,

27:13.436 --> 27:16.856
allow me to introduce
a new member
of our community.

27:17.232 --> 27:19.693
This is Father
Prudentius of Troyes.

27:19.901 --> 27:22.112
Father Prudentius, welcome.

27:23.446 --> 27:27.534
Forgive us, we were just
sampling last
season's vintage.

27:27.617 --> 27:29.744
I trust it was a good year.

27:30.787 --> 27:33.623
Well, I would be most
grateful for your opinion.

27:34.791 --> 27:35.959
Hmm?

27:49.306 --> 27:50.724
I'm so sorry!
Forgive me, I...

27:53.310 --> 27:54.477
It's very good.

27:55.478 --> 27:57.897
It's the way we
taste wines in Frankia.

27:58.773 --> 28:01.484
Otherwise, we would
be perpetually drunk.

28:01.610 --> 28:02.652
Oh.

28:03.153 --> 28:04.487
Very good.

28:12.996 --> 28:15.123
Prudentius has
come to teach us

28:15.206 --> 28:17.292
some of the secrets
of illumination.

28:17.834 --> 28:19.502
Ah.
When Athelstan left,

28:19.586 --> 28:23.965
he left many sacred texts
unadorned and unfinished.

28:24.174 --> 28:28.011
I regard it as my holy duty
to complete that monk's work.

28:28.678 --> 28:30.847
The King has told me
a great deal about him.

28:31.097 --> 28:33.350
I also desire

28:33.683 --> 28:36.853
that Prudentius should teach
Judith to illuminate.

28:38.813 --> 28:41.024
He is troubled
by the idea.

28:44.110 --> 28:47.030
You are a Bishop
of our Holy Church.

28:47.572 --> 28:50.659
Surely you agree that
it would be immoral?

28:53.828 --> 28:54.871
Well?

28:58.041 --> 28:59.209
God...

29:00.919 --> 29:03.755
Saw fit to allow
a former prostitute

29:03.880 --> 29:05.965
to wash the limbs
of his own son

29:06.049 --> 29:07.759
when He was brought
down from the cross.

29:07.884 --> 29:11.763
If He tolerated such a woman
touching the sacred flesh,

29:12.722 --> 29:16.643
how much more
would He approve
of a good and pious

29:16.726 --> 29:20.897
Christian woman adorning
His sacred texts?

29:21.064 --> 29:22.107
Hmm?

29:53.471 --> 29:54.639
Free.

29:58.017 --> 29:59.227
We found Floki!

30:09.404 --> 30:10.572
We have him!

30:11.948 --> 30:13.575
We found him, Father!

30:18.621 --> 30:20.081
The great Floki...

30:23.752 --> 30:24.961
Captured by mere children!

30:28.965 --> 30:31.092
Why didn't
the gods protect you?

30:32.469 --> 30:35.805
Why didn't they
hide you better from
such innocent eyes?

30:37.140 --> 30:38.475
Could it be

30:38.808 --> 30:41.811
that the gods
were not interested
in saving him?

30:42.979 --> 30:45.648
Because they are
angry at you.

30:53.448 --> 30:55.617
Is there anything you
want to say to that?

31:04.793 --> 31:06.002
I've said it all.

31:19.307 --> 31:20.517
Bring him forward, please.

31:22.352 --> 31:23.728
Ah, ah, ah.

31:28.191 --> 31:29.359
You made me suffer...

31:29.692 --> 31:31.736
And now,
I shall make you suffer.

31:32.904 --> 31:35.740
And I've got such a
wonderful punishment for you.

31:36.658 --> 31:37.951
You'll probably
appreciate it, too.

31:38.034 --> 31:39.828
See, I borrowed it
from the gods.

31:41.162 --> 31:42.539
It's very imaginative.

31:42.831 --> 31:46.543
And it goes on,
and on, and on...

31:47.877 --> 31:49.045
And on.

31:50.380 --> 31:51.881
Nothing heroic.

31:52.715 --> 31:54.884
No chance to impress the gods.

32:04.602 --> 32:06.563
Take him! Take him away!

32:14.279 --> 32:15.530
Why are you still angry?

32:15.613 --> 32:18.825
Because Floki still
refuses to admit why
he did what he did!

32:18.908 --> 32:20.076
But he's right.

32:23.079 --> 32:24.247
Right?

32:25.790 --> 32:27.250
What did he do
that was wrong?

32:28.084 --> 32:30.253
All he did was
kill a Christian.

32:30.378 --> 32:31.880
Why should he be
punished just for that?

32:31.963 --> 32:34.591
This is not about
Christians or faith!

32:34.924 --> 32:36.593
It's about loyalty...

32:37.093 --> 32:38.219
And trust!
Ow!

33:02.452 --> 33:04.454
Something you
can't understand.

33:50.583 --> 33:52.001
All right, I'll go fetch.

33:52.251 --> 33:53.670
I'm thirsty.
Stings.

33:54.003 --> 33:55.171
Look at my hilt.

33:57.173 --> 33:59.008
Halt! Enemy to the front!

33:59.217 --> 34:00.677
Cohorts! Enemy approach!

34:00.843 --> 34:02.261
Cohorts!

34:02.345 --> 34:03.680
Stand guard!

34:03.763 --> 34:05.014
We're under attack!

34:05.348 --> 34:07.684
Archers at the ready!

34:07.892 --> 34:09.226
Main gate!

34:21.197 --> 34:22.281
Hold!

34:26.034 --> 34:28.538
Ten men to the gates!
Attack! Go!

34:54.272 --> 34:57.065
Alarm!
The wall is breached!

35:00.903 --> 35:02.071
Man on tower!

35:05.575 --> 35:07.326
All men, engage the enemy!

35:07.410 --> 35:08.745
Go! Attack!

35:09.412 --> 35:11.414
Go! Go! Go! Go!

35:21.299 --> 35:23.760
Archers! Archers! Left flank!

35:25.303 --> 35:26.429
Draw!

35:26.804 --> 35:27.972
Loose!

35:40.777 --> 35:42.612
All men, to the gates!

35:42.779 --> 35:44.155
Attack!

35:52.288 --> 35:54.874
Kill the Queen.
And the child! Go!

35:57.835 --> 35:59.295
Key man! Man with key!

36:25.988 --> 36:27.365
Kill the Queen!

36:27.615 --> 36:29.242
Kill the Queen!

38:15.765 --> 38:16.933
Hold him there!

38:33.950 --> 38:36.869
Kill the Queen!
Kill the Queen!

38:40.957 --> 38:42.291
Hold him still!

38:53.928 --> 38:54.971
No!

38:55.554 --> 38:57.640
No!

38:58.099 --> 38:59.141
No!

39:20.955 --> 39:23.249
Get off! Get off! Get...

40:02.747 --> 40:04.623
What took you so long?

41:06.727 --> 41:08.103
What are you doing up here?

41:09.146 --> 41:11.816
I am
trying to dig a grave.
Can't you see?

41:14.401 --> 41:15.945
For my daughter.

41:23.786 --> 41:24.954
What did she die of?

41:26.330 --> 41:27.540
Does it matter?

41:34.463 --> 41:35.965
Have you told Floki?

41:36.632 --> 41:37.800
No.
