00:31.195 --> 00:33.313
Come on, settle. The
sooner you're settled,

00:33.314 --> 00:36.192
the sooner this is over with.

00:36.193 --> 00:38.432
Thank you. Now, you're going to meet

00:38.433 --> 00:42.430
some men today who've taken
a wrong turn in their lives

00:42.591 --> 00:46.069
and they're going to tell you
their stories and hopefully

00:46.070 --> 00:49.748
make you think a little bit
about the roads you're going down.

00:49.749 --> 00:51.667
It's not going to be any kind of fun,

00:51.668 --> 00:53.907
so you can wipe those
smiles off your faces.

00:53.908 --> 00:57.905
Right, let's meet our first speaker.

01:08.303 --> 01:10.341
What the flip are you looking at?

01:10.342 --> 01:11.621
You think this is funny?

01:11.622 --> 01:14.460
You think this is some kind
of mother flipping joke?

01:14.461 --> 01:18.219
Mother flippers think everything's
a mother flipping joke.

01:18.220 --> 01:22.218
Well, let me tell you, the
jokey ain't no jokey, sucker.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.737
Look at me and what do you see?

01:25.738 --> 01:29.735
Just a bad ass brother who
made a mistake. One mistake.

01:30.336 --> 01:32.334
And now I'm staring at you gimps.

01:32.335 --> 01:36.093
Every flippin' day!

01:36.094 --> 01:38.252
So what's my story?

01:38.253 --> 01:40.972
How did a brother get here?

01:40.973 --> 01:42.691
Well, I'll tell you.

01:42.692 --> 01:46.690
It all started when I went to
fix a printer on floor seven.

01:47.011 --> 01:51.008
As I recall, it was a Tuesday.

01:52.089 --> 01:53.808
It's a lot faster now,

01:53.808 --> 01:56.887
it's one of the advantages
of the Pentium processor.

01:56.888 --> 01:59.886
Yeah...

01:59.887 --> 02:01.725
I like your glasses.

02:01.726 --> 02:04.164
I'm afraid they're not for sale.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.804
Ha ha.

02:05.805 --> 02:08.603
Laugh all you want,
they're not for sale.

02:08.604 --> 02:11.202
You're funny.

02:11.203 --> 02:12.961
Nikki, Nikki, Nikki!

02:12.962 --> 02:16.200
What are you talking
to Clive Sinclair for?

02:16.201 --> 02:17.320
Shut up, Rodge.

02:17.321 --> 02:19.439
Good one. Yup. I get it.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.279
You obviously don't, mate.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.518
Come on, back in your box.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.357
Nice tie, by the way!

02:26.358 --> 02:30.316
Thank you.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.075
Roy, can you come here, please?

02:32.076 --> 02:35.274
Just hold on a second, Jen.
I'm giving phone support.

02:35.275 --> 02:36.594
Okay, so how did that go?

02:36.595 --> 02:40.433
Well, yeah, but that's an
important part of the process.

02:40.434 --> 02:42.152
Yes, if you don't complete that part,

02:42.153 --> 02:44.711
there's no way you're going
to be able to do the next bit.

02:44.712 --> 02:48.710
Okay, so now... Turn it back on again!

02:49.950 --> 02:51.709
People!

02:51.710 --> 02:53.788
That is rude! What is that?

02:53.789 --> 02:56.547
Oh, Jen, I have to say, "Have you
tried turning it off and on again?"

02:56.548 --> 02:59.426
1,000 times a day. It's
like a bloody catchphrase.

02:59.427 --> 03:03.145
If it wasn't for you and Moss
it would be the only thing I say.

03:03.146 --> 03:04.185
It doesn't matter.

03:04.186 --> 03:06.904
Don't take your bad career
decisions out on the users.

03:06.905 --> 03:08.144
I'm not saying it again today.

03:08.145 --> 03:09.943
They can just figure
it out for themselves.

03:09.944 --> 03:12.142
You'll never go a whole
day without saying it.

03:12.143 --> 03:13.542
You don't think I can?

03:13.543 --> 03:14.582
No way.

03:14.583 --> 03:16.821
I bet you 1,000 I can.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.940
That's just posturing. 1,000.

03:19.941 --> 03:22.539
All right. Okay. 100 says
I don't say it again today.

03:22.540 --> 03:23.859
How's that for posturing?

03:23.860 --> 03:26.658
All right, you're on. 100 quid.

03:26.659 --> 03:27.497
All right.

03:27.498 --> 03:29.537
Can you come here for a sec, please?

03:29.538 --> 03:31.856
I want you to take a look at something.

03:31.857 --> 03:33.536
Can't I do it on the phone?

03:33.537 --> 03:37.534
Just come in! It's like 20 feet!

03:41.614 --> 03:42.693
You all right, Moss?

03:42.694 --> 03:44.372
I don't mind telling you, Roy,

03:44.373 --> 03:47.931
that sometimes the people upstairs
cheese me off to such an extent

03:47.932 --> 03:50.170
that if I were the type
to use bad language,

03:50.171 --> 03:52.889
I'd be employing it
bitterly and repeatedly!

03:52.890 --> 03:55.209
Whoa. Moss, that's not like you.

03:55.210 --> 03:57.608
Well, I'm sorry for
mentioning bad language.

03:57.609 --> 04:01.607
No, use bad language, Moss,
please. It'll make you feel better.

04:07.965 --> 04:11.963
Ploppers!

04:12.564 --> 04:15.162
Someone told me I need
a browser on my computer.

04:15.163 --> 04:16.841
Could you install one please?

04:16.843 --> 04:19.761
You don't have a browser
on your computer...?

04:19.762 --> 04:22.160
What is that sound? Is that
coming from your laptop?

04:22.161 --> 04:26.159
It's not supposed to sound...
What the...?! What's all that crap?

04:26.520 --> 04:29.997
Look at all this stuff! I haven't
seen that one since the '90s!

04:29.998 --> 04:31.317
Jen, I have to fix this.

04:31.318 --> 04:33.876
No, no, leave it! I
have it how I like it!

04:33.877 --> 04:36.835
How you like it?! No, no,
no, Jen, it's infected!

04:36.836 --> 04:40.834
If this was a human being,
I'd shoot it in the face!

04:41.115 --> 04:43.673
I just want you to install a browser.

04:43.674 --> 04:44.913
That's the browser there!

04:44.914 --> 04:47.912
Look at it... that's the browser.
Internet Explorer is a browser!

04:47.913 --> 04:50.871
Behind the picture of the lady.
The lady's not supposed to be there.

04:50.872 --> 04:54.869
She's only there sometimes.
But what about that, the E...

04:54.950 --> 04:57.389
But that's the button for
the internet, Roy. I don't...

04:57.390 --> 05:01.387
The button for the
internet?! Jesus Christ!

05:01.788 --> 05:04.346
Oh, shut up! I'm not
a stupid geeky geek.

05:04.347 --> 05:05.826
Jen, you don't need to be a geek

05:05.827 --> 05:08.425
to know that you need a
browser to access the internet!

05:08.426 --> 05:11.224
Yes, because as soon as you
know something like that,

05:11.225 --> 05:14.303
it pushes out something
important and before you know it,

05:14.304 --> 05:17.382
you're painting little
figurines from Lord of The Rings.

05:17.383 --> 05:20.101
You know what, Jen? Do
whatever you want. I don't care.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.541
You want to walk around with
a laptop from The Exorcist,

05:22.542 --> 05:24.020
that's fine. It's not my problem.

05:24.021 --> 05:28.019
Our time is too valuable!

05:28.780 --> 05:30.938
Come on, Moss, let's
go. It's nearly one.

05:30.939 --> 05:34.337
Oh, don't forget. They're giving
a party for Ben Genderson at lunch.

05:34.338 --> 05:36.296
Ben Genderson? How nice for him.

05:36.297 --> 05:39.135
He's been here, what? A
week? When's our party?

05:39.136 --> 05:40.495
I thought you hated parties.

05:40.496 --> 05:42.974
I like parties. It's
balloons I don't like.

05:42.975 --> 05:43.934
Right.

05:43.935 --> 05:45.413
You don't like balloons?

05:45.414 --> 05:47.293
Oh, don't talk to me about balloons.

05:47.294 --> 05:48.252
Why?

05:48.253 --> 05:49.612
Why? Balloons explode, Jen.

05:49.613 --> 05:51.931
They explode suddenly and unexpectedly.

05:51.932 --> 05:55.130
They are filled with the capacity
to give me a little fright

05:55.131 --> 05:57.969
and I find that unbearable.

05:57.970 --> 05:59.529
Where do you want to go for lunch?

05:59.530 --> 06:01.928
It's such a lovely day,
shall we go to the park?

06:01.929 --> 06:04.927
Yeah, let's have a
lovely lunch in the park.

06:19.483 --> 06:22.761
Roy, do you think if I hadn't
paid so much attention in school

06:22.762 --> 06:24.281
I'd be a different person?

06:24.282 --> 06:28.279
No.

06:33.359 --> 06:35.957
We're going to be late
for Ben Genderson's party.

06:35.958 --> 06:38.756
So? I don't want to go to that
thing. If we go to that party,

06:38.757 --> 06:41.475
do you know how many times I'm going to have
to say, "Have you..." The thing that I say?

06:41.476 --> 06:44.114
We've got to hurry up,
we're going to be in trouble.

06:44.115 --> 06:45.154
I'm not running.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.193
Can you do a fast walk?

06:47.194 --> 06:48.233
No.

06:48.234 --> 06:52.232
I'm going to do a fast
walk. See you there.

07:00.790 --> 07:02.548
I need to be at work.

07:02.549 --> 07:06.427
Sorry, sir. Whole street's
closed. Suspicious package.

07:06.428 --> 07:08.387
Come on, let's go the long way round.

07:08.388 --> 07:11.626
We'll miss the presentation. We're
already late. We'll get in trouble.

07:11.627 --> 07:12.905
Calm down.

07:12.906 --> 07:15.304
I can't, Roy. What are we going to do?

07:15.305 --> 07:16.624
Moss, it doesn't matter.

07:16.625 --> 07:19.623
We're going to get in trouble.

07:19.624 --> 07:21.023
You're not going to get in trouble.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.422
Getting in trouble is something
that happens to children.

07:23.423 --> 07:27.261
You're a grown man. Come on.

07:27.262 --> 07:31.259
Why don't we bunk off?

07:32.540 --> 07:33.898
What?!

07:33.899 --> 07:36.777
I was hoping to avoid Jen today
anyway. Why don't we just...

07:36.778 --> 07:39.377
We'll bunk off and make a
day of it. It'll be a laugh.

07:39.378 --> 07:43.055
Oh, gosh, I've got to take this in.
I've never bunked off in my life!

07:43.056 --> 07:45.215
What... what... what will
we do? Where will we go?

07:45.216 --> 07:47.414
You know, we'll do
bunking off kind of things.

07:47.415 --> 07:50.333
Should we be talking this close to
the police? I mean, it is illegal...

07:50.334 --> 07:52.772
Not unless you're supposed to
be in school! Will you relax?

07:52.773 --> 07:55.451
I'm excited, Roy. This is like
taking the blue pill in the Matrix.

07:55.452 --> 07:58.451
I mean, bunking off. The old
me would never have done that!

07:58.452 --> 08:00.450
Say goodbye to that guy. That
guy's history! BANG! He's gone!

08:00.451 --> 08:04.449
Could you not say "bang!"
There's a bloody bomb somewhere!

08:04.929 --> 08:08.887
Come on, let's just go.

08:08.888 --> 08:12.886
Would you stop looking so suspicious!

08:15.806 --> 08:19.284
Which is why after one week
with us, we honour Ben Genderson.

08:22.644 --> 08:24.402
Come on, Ben, say a few words.

08:26.083 --> 08:29.481
I don't know what to...

08:29.482 --> 08:32.200
Such a lovely thing to happen.

08:32.201 --> 08:34.639
I never thought that a major corporation

08:34.640 --> 08:37.717
would be able to focus on
one individual like this.

08:37.719 --> 08:40.597
At my last company, I
felt rather insignificant,

08:40.597 --> 08:43.756
so it's appreciated, it really is.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.675
Cheers.

08:45.676 --> 08:49.674
Don't raise your glass too soon, Ben,
cos this has all been one big ruse.

08:50.235 --> 08:52.753
It isn't your day at all.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.830
That's right. I thought it high time

09:01.831 --> 09:05.069
to give the IT Department
the attention they deserve.

09:05.070 --> 09:07.308
Where are Mark and Ray?

09:09.309 --> 09:11.027
They're not back from lunch yet.

09:11.028 --> 09:15.026
Really? I flew George Lucas
in to see them as a treat.

09:18.986 --> 09:21.784
Oh, well, Jen, more champagne for us.

09:21.785 --> 09:23.903
Let the revels begin!

09:33.061 --> 09:37.059
Oh, yes.

09:42.438 --> 09:45.116
Sitting on the bus.

09:45.117 --> 09:47.235
On the open road.

09:47.236 --> 09:49.915
Kicking back.

09:49.916 --> 09:53.274
Just a pair of cheeky bunkers.

09:53.275 --> 09:55.433
Couple of ne', er do wells.

09:55.434 --> 09:58.072
Yeah.

09:58.073 --> 10:02.071
Roy, can I clarify something?
Are we now loitering?

10:02.192 --> 10:04.030
Erm... yeah.

10:04.031 --> 10:06.189
Because it feels like travelling.

10:06.190 --> 10:09.108
Sure, but we don't want to
go where this bus is going.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.908
So there's an element of loitering.

10:10.909 --> 10:11.908
There's an aimlessness.

10:11.909 --> 10:12.987
Exactly.

10:12.988 --> 10:16.825
Yeah! Who'd want to end up
going to where they wanted to be?

10:16.826 --> 10:18.304
That's what the man wants.

10:18.305 --> 10:19.424
Sock it to 'em.

10:19.425 --> 10:23.423
Fools!

10:27.423 --> 10:30.221
Roy, let's glare.

10:30.222 --> 10:31.260
What?

10:31.261 --> 10:35.259
Let's glare at people,
like a couple of tough nuts.

10:35.340 --> 10:37.538
Okay! Who?

10:37.539 --> 10:41.257
Let's glare at this
sucker on his way to work.

10:41.258 --> 10:45.256
Feeding the corporate machine.

10:45.497 --> 10:46.375
He's coming up.

10:46.376 --> 10:49.015
He's coming up. He's
getting on the bus! Oh, no.

10:49.016 --> 10:53.013
Why did you suggest him? You
could've suggested anybody.

10:54.334 --> 10:55.093
What are you looking at?

10:55.094 --> 10:57.932
We weren't. We thought
you were someone else.

10:57.933 --> 10:59.811
What's it to you?

10:59.812 --> 11:02.730
I'm sorry. We're bunking
off, and he's excited.

11:02.731 --> 11:06.729
We're bunking off!

11:07.090 --> 11:10.008
Roy has a fear of balloons.

11:12.848 --> 11:14.406
A fear of balloons!

11:14.407 --> 11:17.446
That's the craziest thing
I've ever bloody heard!

11:17.447 --> 11:18.525
Some wine for you.

11:18.526 --> 11:19.925
Sorry, I asked for red.

11:19.926 --> 11:20.565
Oh, sorry.

11:20.566 --> 11:23.802
No, no, no, leave it.

11:23.803 --> 11:25.482
Thishasbeen a success.

11:25.483 --> 11:28.241
I have had a lovely, lovely time.

11:28.242 --> 11:30.200
As thingy was saying earlier,

11:30.201 --> 11:33.359
it's easy to go unrecognised
in a big corporation,

11:33.360 --> 11:36.758
so it's appreciated,
it really is. Cheers.

11:36.759 --> 11:40.757
Don't raise yourglasses too soon,
cos this ruse has also been a ruse.

11:46.196 --> 11:47.475
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:47.476 --> 11:51.474
let meintroduce to you our new head
ofhiring and firing, Ben Genderson.

11:55.673 --> 11:59.111
So, Ben, you've been circulating
throughout this fake party,

11:59.112 --> 12:00.631
coming to conclusions.

12:00.632 --> 12:02.990
Who's the obvious dead wood?

12:02.991 --> 12:05.829
Well, yes. Well,
there's Paul over there,

12:05.830 --> 12:09.268
he's been putting his
shopping on expenses.

12:09.269 --> 12:11.387
James here, he can't spell,

12:11.388 --> 12:13.587
and... Sorry, what's your name?

12:13.588 --> 12:14.626
Jeremy.

12:14.627 --> 12:17.825
Jeremy, yes. Jeremy's a drunk.

12:17.826 --> 12:21.824
And Jen. Jen lacks
basic computer skills,

12:21.985 --> 12:25.983
like thinking that IT
stands for "internet things".

12:27.263 --> 12:30.540
Yeah. I don't really need
to know about those things.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.859
I'm a relationship manager. I
manage my team, I'm a team leader.

12:33.860 --> 12:37.858
And where's your team now?

12:38.019 --> 12:40.897
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

12:40.898 --> 12:44.895
Is this my party or not?

12:51.614 --> 12:52.893
What are we doing?

12:52.894 --> 12:56.852
We are loitering.

12:56.853 --> 12:58.771
We are shopping.

12:58.772 --> 13:02.250
We don't have any money, so
it's definitely loitering.

13:02.251 --> 13:06.249
Mark my words, in half an hour,
we shall be asked to leave.

13:11.448 --> 13:12.487
Oh, It's Jen.

13:12.488 --> 13:13.886
Hello, Jen!

13:13.887 --> 13:15.366
Where are you?

13:15.367 --> 13:19.364
We're just sort of taking
a long lunch sort of thing.

13:19.605 --> 13:23.603
You can't! I've been sent an e-mail
questionnaire, have to do ittoday!

13:23.724 --> 13:25.043
I don't know what you're talking about.

13:25.044 --> 13:26.802
It wasn't Ben Genderson's thing,

13:26.803 --> 13:29.401
it was our thing. And then
it was some scary thing,

13:29.402 --> 13:31.920
and now he's sent me a
questionnaire about my job

13:31.921 --> 13:33.360
and my computer won't work!

13:33.361 --> 13:37.278
Is that the best you can
do? I'm not going to say it!

13:37.279 --> 13:39.957
No! No, no, no! No, no, no!

13:39.958 --> 13:43.956
Goddammit, Roy! I didn't bunk off
so I could do some flipping perusing!

13:44.716 --> 13:47.075
I want a taste of the apple, Roy!

13:47.076 --> 13:49.834
I want to bite the
electric tiger's tail,

13:49.835 --> 13:53.193
and ride it till the end
of the mother flipping line.

13:53.194 --> 13:54.752
Will you just calm down, Moss?

14:06.229 --> 14:07.548
What are you doing?

14:07.549 --> 14:08.748
I'm shoplifting!

14:08.749 --> 14:10.387
You've just gone insane!

14:10.388 --> 14:12.306
I've never felt so alive!

14:12.307 --> 14:14.626
We need to get this stuff back!

14:14.627 --> 14:17.345
Okay, they're on to us. Let's just go.

14:17.346 --> 14:21.344
Erm, act normal.

14:25.183 --> 14:26.982
What is wrong with you? Whoareyou?

14:26.983 --> 14:30.980
I don't know any more!

14:32.421 --> 14:36.419
What are we going to do?

14:37.659 --> 14:41.656
No, that's not going to work!

14:43.217 --> 14:47.214
Okay, run! Run, run, run!

14:52.094 --> 14:56.091
Come on! Come on!

15:06.569 --> 15:10.567
<i>Hello. Do you wish for
technical assistance?</i>

15:10.848 --> 15:12.006
Oh, God, I hate these!

15:12.007 --> 15:15.045
<i>Sorry?</i>

15:15.046 --> 15:16.325
What?

15:16.326 --> 15:19.484
<i>How dare you speak to me like that?</i>

15:19.485 --> 15:23.483
Sorry. Can I have technical
assistance, please?

15:24.483 --> 15:28.481
<i>Putting you through. Cow.</i>

15:29.602 --> 15:31.040
Allo?

15:31.041 --> 15:32.320
Hello?

15:32.321 --> 15:35.399
Allo. How can I be of assistance?

15:35.400 --> 15:36.598
What?

15:36.599 --> 15:39.318
How can I be of assistance?

15:39.319 --> 15:43.316
I've got one of your laptops. It
won't get past the loading screen.

15:44.037 --> 15:46.515
Have you tried turning
it off and on again?

15:46.516 --> 15:49.353
Yes. Look, is there
someone else I can talk to?

15:49.354 --> 15:51.033
There is no-one else available.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.112
All right, all right.

15:52.113 --> 15:54.152
All right, all right.
What model do you have?

15:54.153 --> 15:56.031
What model do I have?

15:56.032 --> 15:56.991
Yes.

15:56.992 --> 15:58.870
It's a Zubion, I think.

15:58.871 --> 16:01.949
Ah, the Zubion. I have to say,
we have been having problems

16:01.950 --> 16:04.988
with the Zubion. Can you
press delete while starting up?

16:04.989 --> 16:06.828
I didn't get that.

16:06.829 --> 16:10.826
Can you press delete while starting up?

16:10.947 --> 16:12.946
No. That was worse somehow.

16:12.947 --> 16:14.825
Okay. Can...

16:14.826 --> 16:15.665
Can?

16:15.666 --> 16:17.784
Yes. Can you press...

16:17.785 --> 16:19.184
Can you press.

16:19.185 --> 16:20.023
Delete.

16:20.024 --> 16:21.463
Delete. Delete. Can I press delete?

16:21.464 --> 16:22.663
While.

16:22.664 --> 16:24.382
Wheel?

16:24.383 --> 16:26.341
While.

16:26.342 --> 16:27.501
Whhhheeeel?

16:27.502 --> 16:31.340
While. Er...during!

16:31.341 --> 16:32.300
While! While.

16:32.301 --> 16:33.539
Yes, while!

16:33.540 --> 16:34.219
Yes.

16:34.220 --> 16:36.738
<i>Starting.</i>

16:36.739 --> 16:40.737
<i>Allo?</i>

16:42.177 --> 16:46.175
Come on, Roy! Come
on! We're nearly there!

16:46.416 --> 16:48.014
It's no use.

16:48.015 --> 16:52.013
I can't. I can't.
We're going down again!

16:53.094 --> 16:54.491
How many times is that now?

16:54.492 --> 16:57.650
Oh, this is ridiculous! I
don't want to do this any more!

16:57.651 --> 17:01.649
Oh, all right. All right.

17:01.690 --> 17:03.329
What was all that about?

17:03.330 --> 17:04.887
What?

17:04.888 --> 17:08.887
You shouldn't be messing
around on those things. Go on.

17:10.166 --> 17:14.165
Don't come back here.
I know your faces now!

17:22.643 --> 17:24.402
Bunking off was a terrible idea.

17:24.403 --> 17:26.681
I mean, you were
completely out of control.

17:26.682 --> 17:28.441
Do you even like Grand Designs?

17:28.442 --> 17:29.840
Yuh!

17:29.841 --> 17:32.999
You'll send those DVDs back to the shop.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.519
Okay. I'm sorry, Roy.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.118
It's okay. Okay, let's just
try and get back in to work,

17:37.119 --> 17:40.517
and hopefully nobody will
have noticed we were away.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.996
Oh, my gosh!

17:47.355 --> 17:50.313
It's a robot!

17:50.314 --> 17:52.593
I've never seen one in the wild before.

17:52.594 --> 17:55.672
Where've you come from, fella?
Huh? Where do you come from?

17:55.673 --> 17:58.871
Can we keep him, Roy? I mean,
if he doesn't belong to anyone?

17:58.872 --> 18:01.069
I just don't understand what it's doing.

18:01.070 --> 18:05.068
I mean, this is weird. What is it?

18:15.985 --> 18:18.343
Erm... Moss?

18:18.344 --> 18:19.623
What?

18:19.624 --> 18:20.943
Get away from it.

18:20.944 --> 18:24.502
Why?

18:24.503 --> 18:28.340
Hello, Jen!

18:28.341 --> 18:30.740
It's a robot!

18:30.741 --> 18:32.339
Get away!

18:32.340 --> 18:33.019
What?

18:33.020 --> 18:37.018
Get away! Get away
from it. There's a bomb!

18:37.138 --> 18:39.137
What are you saying?

18:39.138 --> 18:43.136
There's a bomb in the bag!

18:45.976 --> 18:49.973
I think this might be a
bomb disposal robot, Roy.

18:50.014 --> 18:52.053
I know.

18:52.054 --> 18:54.012
We should move away from it.

18:54.013 --> 18:58.011
Yes. We should. But I don't
seem to be able to move.

18:58.532 --> 18:59.650
What?

18:59.651 --> 19:01.050
I can't move.

19:01.051 --> 19:02.249
What do you mean, you can't move?

19:02.250 --> 19:05.728
What do you mean, you
can't move? I can't move.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.527
You have to move, Roy.

19:07.528 --> 19:09.046
I can't move!

19:12.166 --> 19:14.365
I'm just having a couple
of problems with it.

19:14.366 --> 19:16.764
What kind of operating
system does it use?

19:16.765 --> 19:18.723
It's... Vista!

19:18.724 --> 19:22.602
We're going to die!

19:22.603 --> 19:25.601
Have you tried turning
it off and on again?

19:25.602 --> 19:27.800
What?

19:27.801 --> 19:30.479
Have you tried turning
it off and on again?

19:30.480 --> 19:32.639
What?

19:32.640 --> 19:36.637
Have you tried turning
it off and on again?

19:36.998 --> 19:40.996
I just won 100 quid.

19:41.437 --> 19:43.435
Okay. Hang on a second.

19:43.436 --> 19:45.714
Why are you still here?
Why haven't you run away?

19:45.715 --> 19:47.394
Come on, we're a team, I could...

19:47.395 --> 19:51.393
Wait, I could totally
run away, couldn't I?

19:57.272 --> 19:59.270
It's still not working!

20:01.670 --> 20:05.188
Oh, this is a very
common problem with Vista.

20:05.189 --> 20:07.268
I can fix this. I can fix this, Roy!

20:07.269 --> 20:09.227
Everything's going to be okay.

20:10.587 --> 20:14.504
Right. Come here, you.

20:24.262 --> 20:26.700
Wait for me!

20:26.701 --> 20:30.659
Is there a customer support number?

20:32.100 --> 20:35.138
Allo! How can I be of assistance?

20:35.139 --> 20:39.136
What?

20:40.497 --> 20:42.375
So, that's my story.

20:42.376 --> 20:45.854
It ain't a pretty story, but
it's the only one I've got.

20:45.855 --> 20:48.853
And if you bozos don't
buckle up and fly right,

20:48.854 --> 20:52.852
it'll be your story too, capice?

21:17.405 --> 21:20.442
<i>You say you've been having problems</i>

21:20.443 --> 21:23.201
<i>with this particular
bomb disposal computer?</i>

21:23.202 --> 21:24.241
What?

21:24.242 --> 21:25.560
<i>You must take good care,</i>

21:25.561 --> 21:29.559
<i>as the slightest movement can
initiate the detonator procedure.</i>

21:29.720 --> 21:33.238
<i>Seems to me like the domain
link is incapacitated,</i>

21:33.239 --> 21:37.237
<i>so perhaps you could try
turning off the robot,</i>

21:37.338 --> 21:39.557
<i>and then get the man
to run away quickly?</i>
