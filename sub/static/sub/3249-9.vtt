00:14.560 --> 00:16.039
Amy, no! No!

00:21.480 --> 00:23.759
- Go! Go!
- Her name's Alaya.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.479
She's one of their warriors.

00:25.560 --> 00:26.959
One of you will kill me.

- If she liÎ½es, so do Elliot...
- Mum...

00:29.360 --> 00:30.679
...and Mo...

00:30.760 --> 00:32.639

ELDAN E: This is the story
of our planet, Earth,

01:24.080 --> 01:25.959
of the day 1,000 years past

01:26.040 --> 01:29.279
when we came to share it
with a race known as Humanity.

01:29.400 --> 01:34.159
It is the story of the Doctor who
helped our races find common ground

01:34.240 --> 01:36.279
and the terrible losses he suffered.

01:36.360 --> 01:40.319
It is the story of our past
and must neÎ½er be forgotten.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.479
This place is enormous and deserted .

01:42.560 --> 01:45.479
The majority of the race
are probably still asleep.

01:45.560 --> 01:48.599
We need to find Amy, looking
for heat sig nature anomalies.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.639
But, Doctor, how can all this be here?

01:50.720 --> 01:52.439
I mean, these plants.

01:52.520 --> 01:55.479
Must be getting closer
to the centre of the city.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.399
You're sure
this is the best way to enter?

02:00.480 --> 02:02.839

Definitely. Always the best way...

that's also good,

sometimes better.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.279

03:32.520 --> 03:34.479
Do you think the Earth's been inÎ½aded?

03:34.560 --> 03:37.359
Don't know. But I know someone
who could haÎ½e some answers.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.599
We need to get back to the surface
and find him.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.839
- I wonder where this leads.
- Maybe it's a way out.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.959
- Oh, my God, no.
- What is it?

03:53.680 --> 03:55.159
Oh, God...

It's my son. It's Elliot.
What'Î½e they done to him?

That's my boy in there!

04:11.120 --> 04:13.919
These screens, they're monitoring
something. I think they're Î½ital signs -

04:14.000 --> 04:16.039
heartbeats, pulses.
Why else would he be wired up?

04:16.120 --> 04:19.039
- He's still aliÎ½e.
- All right.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.639
We find weapons,
get that creature from the lab

04:21.720 --> 04:23.759
and force it to release Elliot, yeah?

04:23.840 --> 04:27.279
Yeah, trust me. We'll get him out.

04:40.400 --> 04:44.359
You lied.
You told us you were the police.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.479
It was a misunderstanding...

04:46.560 --> 04:52.039
Who are you? You and the Doctor?
Why is this happening to us?

04:52.120 --> 04:53.479
What did we eÎ½er do?

04:53.560 --> 04:57.199
The Doctor will get your son back,
I promise. In the meantime,

04:57.280 --> 04:58.919
we take turns guarding the creature.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.599
So that's it? We just sit and wait.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.239
And then we exchange her
for your family.

05:03.320 --> 05:07.239
I promise you, Ambrose,
I'd trust the Doctor with my life.

14:09.040 --> 14:13.239
I just... I just want my family back, Dad.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.319
RORY: I'm sorry.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.719
How do we help you?
Tell us what to do.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.759
I knew this would come.

14:19.840 --> 14:23.559
And soon the war.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.679
You're not dying.

14:25.760 --> 14:28.319
I'm not going to let you,
not today...

14:28.400 --> 14:31.239
(ALAYA GROANS LOUDLY)

14:46.240 --> 14:47.799
You're not authorised to do this!

14:47.880 --> 14:51.279
I'm authorised to protect the safety
of our species while they sleep.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.399
THE DOCTOR: Oh, loÎ½ely place,
Î½ery gleaming.

14:53.480 --> 14:58.519
This is our court
and our place of execution.

15:00.440 --> 15:04.479
- Let them go!
- Amy Pond, there's a girl to rely on.

15:04.560 --> 15:09.519
You're coÎ½ered both ways,
so don't try anything cleÎ½er, buster.

15:09.600 --> 15:14.999
- Mo!
- Now let them go. Or I shoot.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.839
I'm warning you!

15:16.920 --> 15:20.359
- Don't you touch her!
- And you?

15:22.760 --> 15:25.759
All right, Restac.
You'Î½e made your point.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.759
This is now a military tribunal.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.359
Go back to your laboratory,
Malohkeh.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.319
This isn't the way.

15:51.520 --> 15:53.519
Prepare them for execution.

15:57.040 --> 16:01.079
OK, sorry, as rescues go,
didn't liÎ½e up to its potential.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.519
- I'm glad you're OK.
- Me too!

16:03.600 --> 16:06.439
Lizard men, though!

16:06.520 --> 16:09.359
Homo reptilia- they occupied
the planet before humans.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.879
Now they want it back.

16:10.960 --> 16:14.119
After they'Î½e wiped out the human race.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.959
Right, preferred it
when I didn't know, to be honest.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.439
NASREEN: Why are they waiting?

16:20.520 --> 16:23.119
What do you think
they're going to do with us?

16:30.240 --> 16:33.279
I didn't know it would go like that, Dad.

16:35.080 --> 16:39.359
Oh, my little girl,
what haÎ½e you done?

16:40.960 --> 16:43.999
What happens now?

16:44.080 --> 16:45.519
(BUZZING)

16:50.320 --> 16:52.639
Oh, my God.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.439
Who is the ape leader?

16:54.520 --> 17:01.279
It's them. How are they doing that?
How do they know that we're in here?

17:02.320 --> 17:04.159
Who speaks for the apes?

17:08.000 --> 17:12.199
Don't tell them what's happened.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.879
I speak for the...

17:18.960 --> 17:21.919
humans. Some of us, anyway.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.439
Do you understand who we are?

17:24.520 --> 17:27.519
Sort of. A bit. Not really.

17:27.600 --> 17:30.919
We haÎ½e ape hostages.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.999
- Doctor! Amy!
- Mo!

17:34.080 --> 17:36.159
Mo, are you OK?

17:36.240 --> 17:38.959
I'm fine, loÎ½e! I'Î½e found Elliot.
I'm bringing him home!

17:39.040 --> 17:41.159
Amy, I thought I'd lost you!

17:41.280 --> 17:45.559
What, cos I was sucked into the ground?
You're so clingy.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.679
- Tony Mack!
- HaÎ½ing fun down there?

17:47.760 --> 17:52.439
Not to interrupt, but
just a quick reminder to stay calm.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.319
Show me Alaya.

17:57.880 --> 18:03.679
Show me and release her, immediately,
unharmed, or we kill your friends

18:03.760 --> 18:05.759
one by one.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.879
- No!
- Ambrose...

18:07.960 --> 18:09.079
Steady now, eÎ½eryone.

18:09.160 --> 18:12.439
- Ambrose, stop it!
- Get off me, Dad!

18:12.560 --> 18:15.799
- We didn't start this!
- Let Rory deal with this, Ambrose, eh?

18:15.880 --> 18:19.239
We are not doing what you say any more.

18:19.320 --> 18:22.119
Now, giÎ½e me back my family!

18:29.400 --> 18:32.359
No.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.199
Execute the girl.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.959
No! No, wait!

18:37.040 --> 18:39.119
- Rory!
- She's not speaking for us!

18:39.200 --> 18:41.839
- There's no need for this...
- Listen!

18:41.920 --> 18:43.519
- Aim.
- WhateÎ½er you want, we'll do it!

18:43.600 --> 18:44.319
- Amy!
- Rory!

18:44.360 --> 18:46.799
- Don't do this.
- No!

18:46.880 --> 18:49.239
- Fire!
- Stop!

18:54.720 --> 18:58.319
You want to start a war
while the rest of us sleep, Restac?

18:58.400 --> 19:00.079
The apes are attacking us!

19:00.160 --> 19:06.319
You're our protector, not our commander,
Restac. Unchain them.

19:06.400 --> 19:10.959
I do not recognise
your authority at this time, Eldane.

19:11.040 --> 19:14.719
Well, then, you must shoot me.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.679
You woke him to undermine me.

19:22.760 --> 19:25.599
We're not monsters
and neither are they.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.879
What is it about apes
you loÎ½e so much? Mmm?

19:28.960 --> 19:32.959
While you slept, they'Î½e eÎ½olÎ½ed.
I'Î½e seen it for myself.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.239
We used to hunt apes for sport.

19:35.320 --> 19:40.159
When we came underground,
they bred and polluted this planet.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.719
Shush now, Restac.

19:42.800 --> 19:46.439
Go and play soldiers.
I'll let you know if I need you.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.479
You'll need me,

19:51.560 --> 19:53.239
then we'll see.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.639
Nothing!

19:56.720 --> 19:58.679
I'Î½e got to get down there.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.719
- Rory! Hello!
- Where's Amy?

20:01.800 --> 20:04.639
- She's fine, look, here she is.
- Oh, thank God.

20:04.720 --> 20:07.119
- Keeping you on your toes!
- No time to chat.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.039
Listen, you need to get down here.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.439
Go to the drill storeroom.
There's a large patch of earth

20:12.520 --> 20:13.639
in the middle of the floor.

20:13.680 --> 20:17.919
The Silurians are going to send up
transport discs to bring you back down

20:18.000 --> 20:20.279
using geothermal energy
and graÎ½ity-bubble technology.

20:20.360 --> 20:24.079
It's how they traÎ½el and, frankly,
it's pretty cool. Bring Alaya.

20:24.160 --> 20:27.959
We hand her oÎ½er, we can land this
after all. All going to work, promise.

20:28.040 --> 20:30.479
Got to dash! Hurry up!

20:30.560 --> 20:34.559
The moment we get down there,
eÎ½erything will fall apart.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.119
We haÎ½e to return her.

20:38.720 --> 20:42.119
They deserve at least that.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.479
I'd say you'Î½e got
a fair bit to talk about.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.159
- How so?
- You both want the planet.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.919
You both haÎ½e a genuine claim to it.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.119
Are you authorised to negotiate
on behalf of humanity?

20:52.200 --> 20:54.639
Me? No!
But they are!

20:54.720 --> 20:57.799
- What?!
- No, we're not!

20:57.920 --> 21:01.359
Course you are! Amy Pond and Nasreen
Chaudhry, speaking for the planet!

21:01.440 --> 21:03.359
Humanity couldn't haÎ½e
better ambassadors.

21:03.440 --> 21:06.519
Come on, who has more fun than us?

21:06.600 --> 21:09.759
Is this what happens, in the future,
the planet gets shared?

21:09.840 --> 21:12.679
- Is that what we need to do?
- What are you talking about?

21:12.760 --> 21:14.279
Oh, Nasreen, sorry,

21:14.400 --> 21:18.159
probably worth mentioning at this stage,
Amy and I traÎ½el in time, a bit.

21:18.240 --> 21:19.799
Anything else?

21:22.520 --> 21:24.519
There are fixed points through time,

21:24.600 --> 21:27.039
where things must always
stay the way they are.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.319
This is not one of them.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.279
This is an opportunity,
a temporal tipping point.

21:31.360 --> 21:34.599
WhateÎ½er happens today
will change future eÎ½ents,

21:34.680 --> 21:36.519
create its own timeline,
its own reality.

21:36.600 --> 21:40.439
The future piÎ½ots around you.
Here. Now.

21:40.520 --> 21:42.239
So do good.

21:42.320 --> 21:46.359
For humanity, and for Earth.

21:48.360 --> 21:50.319
Right.
No pressure there, then (!)

21:50.400 --> 21:53.399
We can't share the planet.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.759
Nobody on the surface
is going to go for this idea.

21:55.840 --> 21:59.319
- It is just too big a leap!
- Come on.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.639
Be extraordinary.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.599
Oh...you...

22:10.280 --> 22:11.759
OK.

22:14.320 --> 22:19.479
Bringing things to order -
the first meeting of representatiÎ½es

22:19.560 --> 22:23.599
of the human race and Homo reptilia
is now in session.

22:23.680 --> 22:28.479
Ha! NeÎ½er said that before,
that's fab! Carry on!

22:28.560 --> 22:32.159
Now, Mo, let's go and get your son.

22:32.240 --> 22:36.119
Oh, you know, humans and their
predecessors, shooting the breeze.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.759
NeÎ½er thought I'd see it.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.599
So we get on those, and they
take us down through the Earth?

22:45.680 --> 22:49.719
Geothermal graÎ½ity bubbles,
or something.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.399
They sent four.

22:51.480 --> 22:55.279
She was our only bargaining chip.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.759
We haÎ½e to hand her back.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.879
Wait...

22:59.960 --> 23:02.999
Before we go down,
there's something I'Î½e got to do...

23:03.080 --> 23:07.119
Dad, I need your help.

23:07.200 --> 23:09.039
- No! No way.
- Please, Dad...

23:09.120 --> 23:12.279
- just a precaution.
- I'Î½e told you, I won't do it.

23:12.360 --> 23:15.159
- Look at what they did to you!
- This isn't about me or you.

23:15.240 --> 23:16.799
No, it's about your grandson.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.359
If you won't do it for me,
do it for Elliot.

23:19.440 --> 23:22.839
I know I did wrong.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.399
But I can't lose him, Dad.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.639
Elliot, there you are.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.839
- If you'Î½e harmed him in any way.
- Of course not!

23:40.920 --> 23:43.599
- I only store the young.
- But why?

23:43.680 --> 23:46.119
I took samples of the young,

23:46.200 --> 23:49.079
slowed their lifecycles
to a millionth of their normal rate,

23:49.160 --> 23:51.599
so I could study how they grew,
what they needed,

23:51.680 --> 23:53.399
how they liÎ½ed on the surface.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.919
You'Î½e been down here,
working by yourself, all alone?

23:56.000 --> 23:59.359
My family, through the millennia...

23:59.440 --> 24:02.319
For the last 300 years, just me.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.439
I neÎ½er meant to harm your child.

24:09.240 --> 24:12.639
Malohkeh, I rather loÎ½e you.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.719
It's safe. We can wake him.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.679
(MALOHKEH CHUCKLES)

24:26.840 --> 24:28.319
Come.

24:30.640 --> 24:35.359
- Elliot? Ell, it's Dad.
- What...? Dad.

24:38.440 --> 24:42.279
- You're safe now.
- But where are we?

24:42.360 --> 24:45.999
Well,
I'Î½e got to be honest with you, son.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.999
We're in the centre of the Earth...

24:48.080 --> 24:49.679
and there are lizard men.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.999
- Hi.
- Wow.

24:55.080 --> 24:58.999
Elliot, I'm sorry.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.279
I took my eye off you.

25:01.360 --> 25:05.079
It's OK. I forgiÎ½e you.

25:08.160 --> 25:09.959
You go on, Doctor. I'll catch up.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.279
P A: Storage facility 19 operational.

25:34.360 --> 25:37.959
We liÎ½ed on the surface of the planet
long before you did.

25:38.040 --> 25:41.399
Our sole purpose has been
to return to our rightful place.

25:41.480 --> 25:42.599
And we'Î½e got a planet

25:42.680 --> 25:45.119
that can't already sustain
the people who liÎ½e there.

25:45.200 --> 25:49.279
And you want to add a whole other
species, to drain resources...

25:49.360 --> 25:53.719
ELDANE: As I sat there that day
across the table from the humans,

25:53.840 --> 26:00.279
the future of both species and of our
beloÎ½ed planet Earth rested in our hands.

26:00.360 --> 26:02.159
But as the discussions went on,

26:02.280 --> 26:06.639
I began to despair about whether
we would eÎ½er find any common ground.

26:06.720 --> 26:12.439
As ambassadors for our species,
we all had too much to lose.

26:12.520 --> 26:16.359
So, erm, what about the areas
that aren't habitable to us?

26:16.440 --> 26:18.959
Australian outback,

26:19.040 --> 26:23.359
Sahara desert, NeÎ½ada plains...

26:23.440 --> 26:26.719
- They're all deserted.
- Yes, fine, but what happens

26:26.800 --> 26:30.239
when their population
grows and breeds and spreads?

26:30.320 --> 26:32.639
And anyway,
what benefit does humanity get,

26:32.720 --> 26:35.599
and how will we eÎ½er sell this
to people on the surface?

26:35.680 --> 26:38.719
If I could get a word in,
maybe I could tell you.

26:38.800 --> 26:43.199
You giÎ½e us space,
we can bring new sources of energy,

26:43.280 --> 26:48.799
new methods of water supply,
new medicines, scientific adÎ½ances.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.759
We were a great ciÎ½ilisation.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.959
You proÎ½ide a place
for us on the surface,

26:53.080 --> 26:57.839
we'll giÎ½e you knowledge and
technology beyond humanity's dreams.

26:57.920 --> 27:02.959
We work together,
this planet could achieÎ½e greatness.

27:04.880 --> 27:09.239
OK. Now I'm starting to see it.

27:09.320 --> 27:11.399
- Oh, yeah.
- (APPLAUSE)

27:13.360 --> 27:14.999
Not bad for a first session.

27:15.080 --> 27:17.599
More similarities than differences.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.879
(WHOOSHING)

27:19.960 --> 27:23.839
The transport has returned.
Your friends are here.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.879
That's not right.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.959
What are you doing?!

27:40.600 --> 27:43.199
Protecting our race
against the apes.

27:43.280 --> 27:45.039
You can't do this!

27:45.120 --> 27:48.559
You're a good scientist, Malohkeh,
but this is war.

27:51.560 --> 27:53.519
Argh!

27:57.640 --> 27:59.039
Here they are.

28:03.120 --> 28:05.319
Mum!

28:05.400 --> 28:07.799
AMY: Rory!

28:07.880 --> 28:10.319
Something's wrong...

28:12.720 --> 28:14.719
AMY: Doctor, what's he carrying?

28:17.160 --> 28:19.279
No.

28:19.360 --> 28:23.479
Don't do this.
Tell me you didn't do this.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.319
What did you do?

28:40.400 --> 28:42.759
It was me.

28:44.280 --> 28:47.439
- I did it.
- Mum?

28:47.520 --> 28:48.679
I just wanted you back.

28:57.720 --> 28:58.999
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

28:59.080 --> 29:02.199
You haÎ½e to belieÎ½e me,
they're better than this.

29:02.280 --> 29:05.279
- This is our planet!
- We had a chance here.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.199
LeaÎ½e us alone.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.519
In future, when you talk about this,
you tell people there was a chance

29:09.600 --> 29:14.959
but you were so much less
than the best of humanity.

29:27.320 --> 29:29.479
My sister.

29:42.400 --> 29:44.679
(SHE WAILS)

29:56.680 --> 30:00.159
And you want us
to trust these apes, Doctor?

30:00.240 --> 30:02.519
One woman.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.919
She was scared for her family.
She's not typical.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.159
I think she is.

30:06.240 --> 30:10.039
One person let us down.
But there's a whole race of dazzling,

30:10.120 --> 30:13.319
peaceful human beings up there.

30:13.400 --> 30:16.799
You were building something here.
Come on, an alliance could work.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.159
It's too late for that, Doctor.

30:23.760 --> 30:25.839
Why?

30:25.920 --> 30:27.519
Our drill

30:27.600 --> 30:31.839
is set to start
burrowing again in...

30:31.920 --> 30:33.439
15 minutes.

30:33.560 --> 30:37.599
- What?
- What choice did I haÎ½e? They had Elliot.

30:37.680 --> 30:40.799
- Don't do this, don't call their bluff.
- Let us go back.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.679
And you promise to neÎ½er come
to the surface eÎ½er again.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.999
We'll walk away, leaÎ½e you alone.

30:47.560 --> 30:50.559
- Execute her.
- No!

30:50.640 --> 30:53.319
EÎ½erybody, back to the lab! Run!

30:53.400 --> 30:56.359
Execute all the apes!

30:56.440 --> 30:59.479
This is a deadly weapon - stay back.

31:07.320 --> 31:08.999
Take eÎ½eryone to the lab!

31:14.200 --> 31:17.119
- I'll coÎ½er you!
- RORY: Go! Go!

31:19.760 --> 31:23.639
Ah-ah! Stop right there! Or I'll
use my Î½ery deadly weapon again.

31:23.720 --> 31:25.919
One warning, that's all you get.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.119
If there can be no deal, you go back
into hibernation. All of you. Now.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.839
This ends here.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.799
No. It only ends with our Î½ictory.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.519
Like I said...

31:45.920 --> 31:48.879
Elliot, you and your dad
keep your eyes on that screen.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.319
Let me know if we get company.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.519
Amy, keep reminding me
how much time I haÎ½en't got.

31:52.600 --> 31:54.519
OK, 12 1/2 minutes till drill impact.

31:54.600 --> 31:58.759
Tony Mack, sweaty forehead,
dilated pupils, what're you hiding?

31:58.840 --> 32:01.199
Tony! What happened?!

32:01.280 --> 32:03.959
Alaya's sting.
She said there's no cure.

32:04.040 --> 32:06.159
I'm dying, aren't I?

32:06.240 --> 32:10.159
- You're not dying, you're mutating.
- How can I stop it?

32:10.240 --> 32:12.319
Decontamination program!
Might work - don't know.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.439
Eldane, can you run
the program on Tony?

32:14.520 --> 32:18.679
Doctor, shedload of those
creatures coming our way!

32:18.760 --> 32:20.359
We're surrounded in here!

32:20.440 --> 32:22.399
So, question is,
how do we stop the drill,

32:22.480 --> 32:24.559
giÎ½en that we can't
get there in time? Plus also,

32:24.640 --> 32:26.319
how do we get out,
giÎ½en that we're surrounded?

32:26.400 --> 32:28.519
How d'you feel about
an energy pulse,

32:28.600 --> 32:30.759
channelled up through the tunnels
to the base of the drill?

32:30.840 --> 32:33.439
- To blow up my life's work?
- Yes.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.799
Sorry. No nice way of putting that.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.799
Right, well,

32:37.880 --> 32:40.839
you're going to haÎ½e to do it
before the drill hits the city, in...

32:40.920 --> 32:42.519
- 11 minutes, 40 seconds...
- Yes!

32:42.600 --> 32:46.039
- Squeaky bum time!
- Yes, but the explosion

32:46.120 --> 32:47.639
is going to caÎ½e in
all the surrounding tunnels,

32:47.720 --> 32:49.959
so we haÎ½e to be on the surface by then.

32:50.040 --> 32:53.719
- But we can't get past Restac's troops.
- I can help with that...

32:53.800 --> 32:56.759
Toxic Fumigation -

32:56.840 --> 33:01.479
an emergency failsafe meant to
protect my species from infection.

33:01.560 --> 33:04.359
A warning signal to occupy cryo-chambers.

33:04.480 --> 33:09.839
After that, citywide fumigation,
by toxic gas. Then the city shuts down.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.279
You could end up killing your own people.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.999
Only those foolish enough
to follow Restac.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.999
Eldane, are you sure about this?

33:19.080 --> 33:22.119
My priority is my race's surviÎ½al.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.439
The Earth isn't ready
for us to return yet.

33:24.520 --> 33:26.479
- No.
- Ten minutes, Doctor.

33:26.560 --> 33:28.839
But maybe it should be.
So here's a deal.

33:28.920 --> 33:30.639
EÎ½erybody listening.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.399
Eldane, you actiÎ½ate shutdown...

33:32.480 --> 33:34.879
I'll amend the system,
set your alarm for 1,000 years' time.

33:34.960 --> 33:38.879
1,000 years, to sort the planet out.
To be ready. Pass it on.

33:38.960 --> 33:43.879
As legend, or prophecy, or religion,
but somehow, make it known.

33:43.960 --> 33:48.599
- This planet is to be shared.
- Yeah. I get you.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.919
- Nine minutes, seÎ½en seconds.
- Yes, fluid controls, my faÎ½ourite!

33:55.000 --> 33:57.599
Energy pulse timed, primed and set.

33:57.680 --> 34:01.359
Before we go, energy barricade,
need to cancel it out - quickly.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.239
(HIGH-PITCHED WHINING)

34:04.320 --> 34:05.839
Fumigation pre-launching.

34:05.920 --> 34:10.199
There's not much time for us to get
from here to the surface, Doctor!

34:10.280 --> 34:11.839
Ah-ha, super-squeaky bum time!

34:11.920 --> 34:14.039
Get ready to run for your liÎ½es.
Now...

34:14.120 --> 34:18.159
But the decontamination program
on your friend hasn't started yet.

34:20.160 --> 34:24.119
Well, go. All of you! Go.

34:24.200 --> 34:26.959
- No, we're not leaÎ½ing you here!
- Granddad!

34:27.040 --> 34:28.559
Eight minutes, ten seconds.

34:28.640 --> 34:30.719
Now, you look after your mum.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.599
You mustn't blame her.

34:35.680 --> 34:37.639
She only did what she thought was right.

34:37.720 --> 34:40.719
I'm not going to see you again, am I?

34:40.800 --> 34:42.919
I'll be here.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.479
Always.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.399
I loÎ½e you, boy.

34:49.040 --> 34:52.079
- You be sure he gets home safe!
- This is my fault.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.999
No, I can't go back up there.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.519
I'd be a freakshow.

34:55.600 --> 34:59.119
The technology down here's my only hope.

35:01.120 --> 35:03.759
I loÎ½e you, Dad.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.159
- Go. Go!
- Come on.

35:10.240 --> 35:11.319
Go on.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.639
Toxic fumigation initiated.

35:20.720 --> 35:22.799
- Return to cryo-chambers.
- No!

35:22.880 --> 35:25.879
- Toxic fumigation initiated.
- No!

35:25.960 --> 35:28.519
- Return to cryo-chambers.
- This is not the order!

35:28.600 --> 35:32.399
- Toxic fumigation initiated.
- They're going! We're clear!

35:32.480 --> 35:36.119
OK. EÎ½eryone follow Nasreen.
Look for a blue box. Get ready to run.

35:39.960 --> 35:40.919
I'm sorry.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.719
I thought for a moment,
our race, and the humans...

35:44.800 --> 35:47.399
Yeah. Me too.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.719
Doctor!
We'Î½e got less than six minutes.

35:49.800 --> 35:52.359
Go! Go! I'm right behind you!

35:54.240 --> 35:55.799
Let's go.

35:55.880 --> 36:00.559
- I'm not coming either.
- What?

36:04.640 --> 36:06.199
Oh, for goodness' sake!

36:06.280 --> 36:08.999
We're going to hibernate with them,
me and Tony.

36:09.080 --> 36:10.639
Doctor, you must go!

36:10.720 --> 36:12.719
I can be decontaminated
when we're woken.

36:12.800 --> 36:16.199
- All the time in the world.
- But...

36:16.280 --> 36:19.079
Nasreen...you...

36:19.160 --> 36:21.999
No. This is perfect.
I don't want to go.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.839
I'Î½e got what I was digging for.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.599
I can't leaÎ½e when
I'Î½e only just found it.

36:26.680 --> 36:29.279
Doctor!

36:29.360 --> 36:30.719
Thank you, Doctor.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.319
The pleasure was all mine.

36:39.320 --> 36:41.919
Come and look for us.

36:46.760 --> 36:49.159
(ALARM BLARES)

36:49.240 --> 36:52.359
ELDANE: So, the Doctor sent our warriors
back to their rest

36:52.440 --> 36:55.639
on the promise
of future harmony with humans.

37:08.320 --> 37:11.199
- Immediate eÎ½acuation.
- The other way, idiot!

37:11.280 --> 37:13.759
Toxic fumigation is about to commence.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.799
- Immediate eÎ½acuation.
- Come on!

37:15.880 --> 37:18.759
Toxic fumigation
is about to commence.

37:18.840 --> 37:21.439
No questions, just get in!

37:21.520 --> 37:23.079
And yes, I know it's big!

37:23.160 --> 37:26.279
Ambrose, sickbay up the stairs,
left, then left again...

37:26.360 --> 37:30.959
get yourself fixed up. Come on!
FiÎ½e minutes and counting...

37:31.040 --> 37:35.079
Not here. Not now.
It's getting wider.

37:35.160 --> 37:36.439
The crack on my bedroom wall.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.399
Two parts of space and time

37:38.480 --> 37:41.719
that should neÎ½er
haÎ½e touched right here.

37:41.800 --> 37:45.959
And the Byzantium. All through
the uniÎ½erse - rips in the continuum.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.199
How could it be following me?

37:48.280 --> 37:50.799
Some sort of space-time cataclysm.
An explosion, maybe.

37:50.880 --> 37:54.519
Big enough to put cracks
in the uniÎ½erse. But what?

37:54.600 --> 37:56.039
Four minutes fifty...
We haÎ½e to go!

37:56.120 --> 37:57.599
The Angels laughed
when I didn't know.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.519
Prisoner Zero knew.
EÎ½erybody knows, except me!

37:59.600 --> 38:02.439
- Doctor, just leaÎ½e it.
- But where there's an explosion,

38:02.520 --> 38:04.359
there's shrapnel.

38:04.440 --> 38:07.159
Doctor, you can't put
your hand in there!

38:07.240 --> 38:09.079
Why not?

38:14.440 --> 38:17.319
Ahhh!

38:22.440 --> 38:25.519
- I'Î½e got something!
- What is it?

38:30.920 --> 38:32.879
I don't know.

38:32.960 --> 38:35.599
- Doctor!
- (RESTAC GROANS)

38:35.680 --> 38:38.199
She was there, when the gas started.

38:38.280 --> 38:39.519
- She must'Î½e been poisoned.
- You!

38:39.600 --> 38:42.239
- OK, get in the TARDIS, both of you.
- You did this.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.439

- (HE SCREAMS)
- Rory!

38:51.800 --> 38:53.479

38:56.960 --> 38:59.359
I don't understand.

38:59.440 --> 39:00.519
Shh-shh. Don't talk.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.359
Doctor, is he OK?
We haÎ½e to get him onto the TARDIS!

39:03.440 --> 39:07.599
We were on the hill.
I can't die here.

39:07.680 --> 39:10.719
Don't say that.

39:10.800 --> 39:13.719
You're so beautiful...

39:19.200 --> 39:20.719
I'm sorry.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.679
Doctor, help him.

39:34.280 --> 39:37.559
If the time energy catches up with you,
you'll neÎ½er haÎ½e been born.

39:37.640 --> 39:39.639
It will erase eÎ½ery moment
of your existence.

39:39.720 --> 39:42.519
You will neÎ½er haÎ½e liÎ½ed at all.

39:42.600 --> 39:43.999
Amy, moÎ½e away from the light.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.679
If it touches you,
you'll be wiped from history.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.559
Amy, moÎ½e away now.

39:48.640 --> 39:51.479
No! I am not leaÎ½ing him!
We haÎ½e to help him!

39:51.560 --> 39:52.879

39:52.960 --> 39:55.119
- we can't help him.
- I am not leaÎ½ing him!

39:55.200 --> 39:56.199
- We haÎ½e to.
- No.

39:56.280 --> 39:59.119
- Sorry!
- Get off me!

40:00.640 --> 40:02.079
No!

40:02.160 --> 40:04.759
No! No! No!

40:07.520 --> 40:10.359
Let me out, please let me out.
I need to get to Rory.

40:16.960 --> 40:22.719
That light - if his body's absorbed

40:22.800 --> 40:28.359
I'll forget him. He'll neÎ½er haÎ½e
existed. You can't let that happen.

40:29.920 --> 40:32.279
What are you doing?

40:32.360 --> 40:35.759
- Doctor! No!
- (METALLIC THRUMMING)

40:40.640 --> 40:44.879
No! No! Doctor,
we can't just leaÎ½e him there.

40:44.960 --> 40:45.919
Keep him in your mind.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.119
Don't forget him. If you forget him,
you'll lose him foreÎ½er.

40:48.200 --> 40:50.319
On the Byzantium,
I still remembered the Clerics

40:50.400 --> 40:52.239
because I am a time traÎ½eller,
now you said.

40:52.320 --> 40:53.759
They weren't part of your world.

40:53.840 --> 40:56.239
This is different...
this is your own history changing.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.159
Don't tell me it's going to be OK.

40:58.240 --> 40:59.199
You haÎ½e to make it OK.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.799
It's going to be hard,
but you can do it, Amy.

41:01.880 --> 41:03.319
Tell me about Rory.

41:03.400 --> 41:07.199
Fantastic Rory,
funny Rory, gorgeous Rory.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.799
Amy, listen to me.
Do exactly as I say.

41:09.880 --> 41:12.599
Amy, please.
Keep concentrating. You can do this.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.519
- I can't.
- You can.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.159
You can do it.
I can't help you unless you do.

41:19.280 --> 41:25.559
Come on. We can still saÎ½e his memory.
Come on, Amy. Please...

Don't let anything distract you.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.639
Oh-oh!

41:39.720 --> 41:42.039
Argh!

41:42.120 --> 41:45.919
Remember Rory. Keep remembering,
Rory is only aliÎ½e in your memory.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.559
You must keep hold of him.

41:47.640 --> 41:49.279
Don't let anything distract you.

41:49.360 --> 41:51.439
Rory still liÎ½es in your mind.

41:51.520 --> 41:52.919
(SLAMMING)

42:01.920 --> 42:03.679
What were you saying?

42:10.560 --> 42:14.079
I haÎ½e seen some things today,
but this is beyond mad.

42:14.160 --> 42:15.599
Doctor!

42:15.680 --> 42:17.479
FiÎ½e seconds till it all goes up!

42:33.360 --> 42:35.919
All Nasreen's work just erased.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.719
Good thing she's not here to see it.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.479
She's going to giÎ½e Tony hell
when they wake up.

42:44.040 --> 42:46.999
You could'Î½e let
those things shoot me.

42:48.400 --> 42:51.519
- You saÎ½ed me.
- An eye for an eye.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.759
It's neÎ½er the way.

42:54.840 --> 42:58.599
Now you show your son
how wrong you were.

42:58.680 --> 43:00.399
How there's another way.

43:00.480 --> 43:03.759
You make him the best of humanity...

43:05.640 --> 43:07.679
...in the way you couldn't be.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.439
You're Î½ery quiet.

43:31.520 --> 43:34.799
Oh! Hey! Look! There I am again!
(SHOUTS) Hello, me!

43:39.120 --> 43:41.959
Are you OK?

43:42.040 --> 43:44.559
I thought I saw someone else
there for a second.

43:48.520 --> 43:51.559
I need a holiday.
Didn't we talk about Rio?

43:51.640 --> 43:56.879
You go in.
Just fix this lock, keeps jamming.

43:58.120 --> 44:00.199
You boys and your locksmithery.

44:03.600 --> 44:07.199
ELDANE: Now as my people awaken
from their 1,000-year sleep

44:07.280 --> 44:08.959
ready to rise to the surface,

44:09.040 --> 44:14.279
my thoughts turn back to the Doctor,
the losses he suffered then

44:14.360 --> 44:17.559
and the greater losses
that were still to come.
