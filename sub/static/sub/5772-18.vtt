(Mindy)
Building a business
from the ground up is difficult.

00:05.239 --> 00:06.540
From filing permits
to picking

00:07.741 --> 00:09.210
the right Georgia O'Keeffe
poster for your waiting room,

00:09.310 --> 00:11.011
the process can be
overwhelming,

00:11.112 --> 00:13.247
especially when you
have to constantly supervise

00:13.347 --> 00:17.385
your hired help because
they get so easily distracted.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.019
No, no, no!
Uh! Ah!

00:19.120 --> 00:20.020
- Oh, God.
- Ah!

00:20.121 --> 00:21.355
Oh, God.
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:22.590 --> 00:23.524
(Mindy)
Plus, ironically,
burning the candle at both ends

00:24.592 --> 00:26.260
leaves almost no time
for your personal flames.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.295
Here you go, babe.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.030
Aw.
Thank you, sweetheart.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.333
(Mindy)
I've also learned that even
when you seek friendly advice

00:32.433 --> 00:35.035
from business pros, they can
feel threatened by your talent.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.771
Kris Jenner, hi!
My name is Mindy Lahiri.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.340
I started
the Lahiri fertility clinic.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.774
Again?
How did she get in here?

00:40.874 --> 00:43.043
Please, please. Your womb
is a national treasure!

00:43.144 --> 00:44.512
If you could just tweet
about my clinic--

00:44.612 --> 00:46.214
But at the end of the day,

00:46.314 --> 00:47.715
there is nothing
more satisfying

00:47.815 --> 00:50.351
than seeing the results
of all of your hard work.

00:50.451 --> 00:51.819
Okay, get to it, babe.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.521
Are you guys ready?

00:53.621 --> 00:54.455
Hell yeah.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.257
I've been ready
since I woke up here.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.559
The Lahiri Fertility Clinic
has purchased

00:58.659 --> 01:01.095
some primo advertising space

01:01.195 --> 01:03.564
in a very cool spot
for movers and shakers.

01:03.664 --> 01:04.532
[laughs]

01:04.632 --> 01:05.799
Ta-da!

01:07.301 --> 01:08.536
Okay.
Sir?

01:08.636 --> 01:10.704
Sir, I'm obviously trying
to unveil something.

01:10.804 --> 01:11.739
Could you please move?

01:11.839 --> 01:13.374
Thank you, thank you.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.676
Ta-da!
"We got you, girl!"

01:15.776 --> 01:17.845
I cancelled cardio ballet
for this?

01:17.945 --> 01:20.148
Doesn't that just make you want
to come get impregnated by me?

01:20.248 --> 01:21.682
Is that even you, Dr. L?

01:21.782 --> 01:23.751
The eyes on that woman
are hella blue.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.719
Tamra, I have told you
a million times,

01:25.819 --> 01:27.421
my eyes photograph blue.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.157
She has blue eyes, Tamra.

01:29.257 --> 01:30.391
You look like
a werewolf.

01:30.491 --> 01:31.559
(Beverly)
I once knew a werewolf.

01:31.659 --> 01:32.726
(Tamra)
Can I fix it with a Sharpie?

01:32.826 --> 01:34.395
(Morgan)
Can I get one for my bedroom?

01:34.495 --> 01:37.331
[hip-hop music]

01:37.431 --> 01:38.832
*

01:38.932 --> 01:41.835
(Jeremy)
I am so professionally excited
this morning.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.804
I have to doff my cap

01:43.904 --> 01:45.239
to Dr. Adrian Bergdahl,

01:45.273 --> 01:45.306
who has done more procedures
this week

01:46.874 --> 01:48.842
than all the other doctors
combined.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.811
It is amazing
what you can accomplish

01:50.911 --> 01:52.680
when you don't spend an hour

01:52.780 --> 01:55.149
planning
your two-hour lunch break.

01:55.249 --> 01:58.319
I think it's really cool
that Dr. Bergdahl is able

01:58.419 --> 02:01.355
to do his one job
while also not being pregnant.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.425
Meanwhile, in addition
to my responsibilities here,

02:04.525 --> 02:07.728
I have started my own business,
the Lahiri Fertility center.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.464
Yes, we know.
You made us all buy merch.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.500
I just want to say,
I love the color.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.336
This is the longest I've ever
gone without being hit by a car.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.171
The setup over there is sick.

02:17.271 --> 02:20.308
My patients are like,
"Are we at a spa?"

02:20.408 --> 02:23.711
I mean, they will say that
once I get my first patient.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.180
Yeah.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.417
I think we should send
all our referrals her way.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.185
Well, that sounds
like favoritism,

02:31.285 --> 02:32.886
but there is
a kernel of truth in it,

02:32.986 --> 02:35.556
and I would like to take
this opportunity...

02:35.656 --> 02:36.757
Oh.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.293
To invite all of you
to our grand opening gala.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.328
[beatboxing]

02:40.428 --> 02:41.562
(Mindy)
There is a dress code.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.163
It's risquÃ© red carpet.
Have fun with it.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.532
(Morgan)
But take it seriously, okay?

02:44.632 --> 02:45.766
You come looking like crap,

02:45.866 --> 02:46.800
you're gonna leave
looking like crap,

02:46.900 --> 02:48.336
'cause I'm not gonna
let you in.

02:50.438 --> 02:53.307
Excuse me, everyone,
I have an interruption.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.809
Morgan, Beverly, and I are doing
a walk-a-thon to raise money

02:55.909 --> 02:57.745
for a problem
that affects us all--

02:57.845 --> 02:58.912
nurse obesity.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.848
What?
You're all skinny as hell!

03:00.948 --> 03:02.550
Yeah, due to poverty.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.353
We're looking to raise $250,000,
so it'd be great if I could put

03:06.354 --> 03:07.488
each of the doctors down
for $50,000 to start.

03:07.588 --> 03:08.656
$50,000?

03:08.756 --> 03:10.324
(Morgan)
Hey. Dr. Bergdahl, I feel like

03:10.424 --> 03:11.959
you're not giving us
your undivided attention here.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.561
I'm sorry you feel that way.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.429
It's just that I don't care
about this at all.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.732
Hey, hey, hold up, let me just
tell you how this office works.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.200
An office is a family.

03:21.335 --> 03:22.970
No, a family is a family,
and between my beautiful wife

03:23.070 --> 03:25.573
and my kids,
who look more like me,

03:25.673 --> 03:26.840
my plate is full
with my own business.

03:26.940 --> 03:27.841
Okay, fine, we get it.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.510
You're rich,
and you own a plate.

03:29.610 --> 03:30.578
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.579
No, my bagels!

03:31.679 --> 03:32.613
- Hey!
- Those are my bagels!

03:33.447 --> 03:33.747
Those bagels are
Morgan's weekend food!

03:34.448 --> 03:35.249
- Hello?
- Let him have 'em.

03:35.816 --> 03:36.317
I'll starve to death,

03:37.184 --> 03:37.718
and my death will thaw
his icy heart.

03:38.586 --> 03:39.320
Did you see it?
He took the bagels.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.955
Yes, Dr. Bergdahl is gruff,
and he is rude,

03:42.055 --> 03:43.324
but you know who else is?

03:44.292 --> 03:44.992
Chris Christie,
and he's our vice president.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.461
Well, I can't handle
being treated like dirt.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.496
That's why I quit
my dream job

03:48.596 --> 03:50.664
doing customer service
at the cable company.

03:50.698 --> 03:50.731
If I can tolerate dress sneakers
at the Met,

03:52.766 --> 03:54.602
you can tolerate
a prickly doctor,

03:54.702 --> 03:56.537
who happens to be
our best worker.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.639
The guy stinks,
and that's coming from a man

03:58.739 --> 04:00.474
who sleeps with
a dozen wet dogs every night.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.711
Okay, Danny, Jeremy,
they're not completely wrong,

04:03.811 --> 04:07.281
and we cannot have our entire
support staff up and quit.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.616
That's how we ended up
with these guys.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.318
- What?
- Hey, I'm slammed.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.685
Can one of you nurses
make me a sandwich?

04:11.785 --> 04:14.455
Nothing fancy,
just ham, mustard, avocado.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.890
Anybody else want anything?
Nurses are making sandwiches.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.759
Do I like I work
at Au Bon Pain?

04:18.859 --> 04:21.362
Fine, I'll talk to him.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.565
[snoring]

04:24.665 --> 04:25.599
Will you quit snoozing?

04:25.699 --> 04:26.800
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey!

04:26.900 --> 04:28.336
[gasps]

04:28.436 --> 04:29.603
We have our first patient.

04:29.703 --> 04:30.904
Oh, God.
Okay.

04:31.004 --> 04:31.972
How do I look?
Do I have drool?

04:32.873 --> 04:33.407
Relax, you've never looked
more beautiful.

04:33.807 --> 04:34.408
How do I look?

04:35.208 --> 04:36.644
Nobody cares!
Just send her in.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.278
(Morgan)
This way.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.313
Ta-da.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.914
Welcome.
Please have a seat.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.316
Thank you.

04:43.451 --> 04:45.853
So are you accompanying your
daughter to her appointment?

04:45.953 --> 04:47.588
No, I don't have
a daughter.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.790
That's where you come in,
sweetheart.

04:51.659 --> 04:54.395
Morgan, we've been
pranked again!

04:54.495 --> 04:55.496
- Prankster?
- Yeah.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.497
Think it's funny
to prank us, huh?

04:56.597 --> 04:57.598
Wait, I don't
understand this.

04:57.698 --> 04:58.766
Yeah, I bet
you don't understand.

04:59.800 --> 04:59.833
- Get outta here.
- Get your ass up, come on.

05:00.401 --> 05:00.434
You're done for the day.

05:01.068 --> 05:01.935
I've never been so insulted.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.438
You are in big trouble,
and I love older women.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.508
It's nice to see you,
Dr. Castellano.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.009
I'm really glad to hear
you're moving forward

05:09.109 --> 05:10.878
with your fertility
treatment.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.747
Why don't you have a seat
inside, and we'll get started?

05:13.847 --> 05:17.351
[both mouthing words]

05:17.451 --> 05:19.887
Now, of course there's a variety
of top-notch specialists

05:19.987 --> 05:20.888
here in Manhattan.

05:21.722 --> 05:22.390
[phone buzzing]
- Excuse me a second.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.325
[phone chimes]

05:25.426 --> 05:27.528
Top-notch specialists
right here in Manhattan.

05:27.628 --> 05:28.629
[phone buzzing]

05:28.729 --> 05:31.665
[phone chiming]

05:35.102 --> 05:36.937
Where were we?

05:37.037 --> 05:40.340
Psst, pamphlet.
Ahem, pamphlet.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.141
I left a pamphlet.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.743
[coughing]
Get away from the door!

05:42.843 --> 05:43.844
Are you okay?

05:44.778 --> 05:46.079
There's a cold
going around the office here.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.080
Oh.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.582
Dr. Mindy Lahiri,
for instance,

05:49.717 --> 05:50.851
opened up a fertility practice
right here on this floor,

05:51.852 --> 05:52.486
and she just finished
a fellowship at Stanford.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.987
Interesting.

05:55.055 --> 05:55.823
Has she helped a lot
of your patients get pregnant?

05:56.690 --> 06:00.127
Sh--uh, she's
a very experienced OB/GYN.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.462
Okay.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.997
So she has helped patients
get pregnant?

06:04.097 --> 06:06.600
She has helped them
be pregnant.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.602
What--what does that mean?

06:08.702 --> 06:09.837
[sighs]

06:10.904 --> 06:13.841
No, she hasn't had any
fertility patients of her own.

06:16.777 --> 06:17.945
Well, thank you so much.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.880
Thank you.

06:19.980 --> 06:20.948
Hey.

06:21.915 --> 06:22.683
So when does she want
to make an appointment?

06:23.751 --> 06:24.485
I'm supposed to see a psychic
about my missing shoe,

06:25.285 --> 06:25.953
but I think
I can move that around.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.388
Babe, I told her
all about you...

06:28.489 --> 06:29.690
You're the best.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.594
And she wanted me to recommend
a more established practice.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.430
And she went with them.

06:36.464 --> 06:36.497
What?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.704
What was I supposed to say
to the woman when she asked me

06:43.804 --> 06:45.172
how many patients
you got pregnant?

06:45.272 --> 06:46.173
Do you want me to lie?

06:46.273 --> 06:47.675
I lie for you all the time!

06:47.775 --> 06:48.876
Remember when I told
that cop in the park

06:49.910 --> 06:50.544
that we were just
two male friends wrestling?

06:51.479 --> 06:51.912
That's different.
I mean, this whole thing,

06:52.446 --> 06:53.481
this is professional.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.883
Look, I believe in you,
but you're just getting started.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.552
Would you get your hair cut
by Vito's trainee, Little Vito?

06:58.652 --> 06:59.620
No, you go to Vito.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.888
Are you comparing
my practice

07:00.988 --> 07:02.890
to Little Vito,
the barber trainee?

07:02.990 --> 07:05.125
This is my dream, and you're
supposed to be helping me.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.427
Look, I'll make you
a salad tonight, right?

07:07.528 --> 07:09.497
Kale, grilled chicken,
a little asparagus.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.964
You love my corn on the cob,
right?

07:11.064 --> 07:11.999
A salad?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.734
I thought you were
gonna buy me some jewelry.

07:13.834 --> 07:14.735
I actually don't have time,

07:15.603 --> 07:16.003
because I have to go
work on my practice,

07:16.904 --> 07:17.805
because I'm not getting
any help at all.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.139
Babe, come on.

07:19.239 --> 07:22.209
Little Vito's gonna be
a great barber someday.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.014
Adrian,
have you seen the--

07:27.114 --> 07:31.552
Whew. [sniffs]
Oh, that's bad.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.823
Oh, wow,
would you look at this?

07:35.923 --> 07:38.125
I got an extra deodorant
in my two-for-one deal.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.893
It's from the Al Pacino
fragrance line,

07:39.993 --> 07:41.161
"Scent of a Man."

07:41.261 --> 07:42.162
Nah, I'm good, man.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.230
I couldn't even handle it

07:44.164 --> 07:44.898
when my wife put potpourri
in the bathroom,

07:45.699 --> 07:46.534
but luckily,
the stupid cat ate it,

07:47.434 --> 07:48.001
and that solved
two problems at once.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.037
Hey.
Ooh.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.805
- Yeah.
- Hi, Adrian.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.073
I wanted to talk to you.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.743
The support staff have been
complaining about you.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.177
Oh. Really?
They complained to you?

07:58.411 --> 07:59.847
Maybe the best thing would be
to take them out for a chat.

08:00.781 --> 08:01.982
Yeah, take 'em out for coffee
or deodorant.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.184
I am so, so sorry
you had to get involved.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.252
I'm on it.

08:06.119 --> 08:06.887
- All right, pal.
- Okay, take care.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.689
Have a great day.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.892
(Morgan)
I haven't called my lawyer yet,

08:11.992 --> 08:13.794
but put a sub sandwich
in the fridge and you label it--

08:13.894 --> 08:16.496
Hey, you got a problem with me,
you bring it to me.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.065
I did not become an OB/GYN

08:18.165 --> 08:19.900
just to deal
with a bunch of whiny babies!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.669
Don't be coming in here
yelling at us.

08:21.769 --> 08:22.770
You don't even talk to us.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.505
Yeah, do you even know
what my job is?

08:25.606 --> 08:26.774
I mean,
I definitely know it.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.742
I just want to hear
someone else say it.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.744
Dr. B, we're willing
to overlook this incident,

08:30.844 --> 08:31.812
if you are willing to make

08:32.713 --> 08:33.647
a sizable donation
to our fund-raiser.

08:34.548 --> 08:35.549
Yeah, I'll donate
to your fund-raiser.

08:35.649 --> 08:36.550
Yes.

08:37.384 --> 08:38.285
From the cold depths
of an icy hell!

08:38.385 --> 08:41.822
[all yelling]

08:41.922 --> 08:42.890
I don't know how much
we've raised now.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.024
Okay, calm down.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.193
- You need to fire Dr. Bergdahl.
- Yeah.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.295
Either he goes or we go.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.902
Fine, I'll talk to him.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.070
In fairness, he does seem
genuinely disturbed.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.306
I don't feel safe.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.141
[all groan]

09:01.241 --> 09:03.644
Oh, this stinks, Morgan.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.012
No, they smell like feet.
It's fine.

09:05.112 --> 09:08.816
What is to become of me?
My modeling days are over.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.150
You got nice feet.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.485
You could pose these on some
decent foot fetish websites.

09:12.586 --> 09:15.656
Thank you, that's the nicest
thing anyone's ever said to me.

09:15.756 --> 09:16.657
You're welcome.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.025
If only I knew
but one couple

09:18.125 --> 09:19.927
that was having
fertility problems.

09:20.027 --> 09:23.163
Ugh, why are all my friends
glamorous and 21 years old?

09:23.263 --> 09:24.765
Oh, my God!

09:24.865 --> 09:26.133
I know just the person!

09:26.233 --> 09:27.601
Okay, I'm pregnant.

09:27.701 --> 09:28.802
I know,
so you got to be careful, girl.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.037
I--okay.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.139
I actually know someone
who could really use your help.

09:32.973 --> 09:33.607
He and his girlfriend
have been having

09:34.374 --> 09:34.975
a very hard time
getting pregnant.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.810
What?
That's so great!

09:37.745 --> 09:39.246
And the best part is,
you already know 'em.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.649
No. No.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.050
My sperms are bad.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.652
I'm sorry to hear that,
Cousin Lou.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.854
It took a lot of courage
for me to come in here today.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.890
Usually that's something
that I say, but--

09:49.990 --> 09:51.058
I think
it's because he always refuses

09:51.158 --> 09:52.292
to wear the apron
at the dentist.

09:52.392 --> 09:55.328
My reasoning is that aprons
are for girls,

09:55.428 --> 09:58.198
and it's ironic that,
in trying not to be a girl,

09:58.298 --> 09:59.700
I became less of a man.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.334
I'm not an orthodontist,

10:01.434 --> 10:03.336
but I wouldn't be
too hard on yourself.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.005
I have a tendency
to do that.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.340
I'm going to do
whatever I can to help you.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.242
[Morgan laughs]

10:09.342 --> 10:11.178
I can't believe I'm gonna be
a first cousin once removed.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.014
Now, before I hand over
the Tookers family jewels

10:14.114 --> 10:15.649
to pay for my new testicles,

10:15.749 --> 10:18.218
I need to know,
you have done this before, yes?

10:18.318 --> 10:20.153
This?

10:20.253 --> 10:22.322
Lou, I'm offended
you even asked.

10:22.422 --> 10:23.991
Obviously.

10:24.091 --> 10:27.327
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just doing
my dude diligence,

10:27.427 --> 10:29.629
and Sandra is doing
her chick diligence.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.800
Now, may we ask, how have
your patients fared in the past?

10:32.900 --> 10:35.836
My patients will have done
very well.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.171
Wait a second, did you just use
the future pluperfect?

10:38.271 --> 10:40.073
I was
a substitute English teacher.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.811
Yes, technically
I have not had a patient yet.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.979
Okay, Sandra, we're just
gonna have to figure out

10:46.079 --> 10:46.947
another way to get a baby.

10:47.047 --> 10:47.981
Oh, there's that drunk nanny

10:48.882 --> 10:49.282
down at the park
that always falls asleep.

10:50.317 --> 10:50.918
I mean, look, if Mindy
can't get someone pregnant--

10:51.785 --> 10:52.152
Wait, wait, wait!
Stop, stop, stop!

10:53.253 --> 10:56.189
Um, what if I told you
that I got myself pregnant?

10:56.289 --> 10:59.226
Yeah.
Danny and I are expecting.

10:59.326 --> 11:03.196
Wait, you were having problems
with fertility just like us?

11:03.296 --> 11:05.899
Yeah, just like you,
and now we're doing great.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.134
Well, if you could
get yourself pregnant,

11:07.234 --> 11:08.201
then that's good enough for us.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.202
We're in!

11:09.302 --> 11:10.704
- Really?
[laughter]

11:10.804 --> 11:13.006
I mean, great,
my first patient.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.843
To think, Dr. Castellano's
shooting blanks just like me!

11:15.943 --> 11:18.712
- Yep.
- His sperm's no good either!

11:22.783 --> 11:24.084
but if it's good enough
for the Puerto Rican guy

11:24.184 --> 11:26.086
at the couch store, it's
good enough for you, I assume.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.387
- Okay, yup, time to go.
- Thank you.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.156
Bye.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.290
Our first patient!

11:31.258 --> 11:32.159
- Hey. Come here, come here.
- Wow, first--

11:33.160 --> 11:33.894
- Ow! My ear! My ear!
- Over here, over here.

11:34.795 --> 11:35.428
Come on, how could you tell
Cousin Lou

11:36.363 --> 11:37.364
that Dr. C has issues
with infertility?

11:38.431 --> 11:39.733
When I signed on to be
a partner at this practice--

11:39.833 --> 11:40.934
Okay, you are not a partner.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.335
You are a handyman,

11:42.435 --> 11:43.370
and you're not even
good at that.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.872
Oh, my God!

11:46.039 --> 11:47.474
- Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh! Ah!
- Stop, stop, get off of me.

11:47.574 --> 11:48.942
For the last time,
you cannot

11:49.042 --> 11:50.177
jump into my arms
when you're surprised.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.011
Okay, look,
I can't be party

11:51.111 --> 11:52.479
to any kind of deception
around here.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.348
Okay, yes, I let a white lie
go a little too far.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.317
- Yeah.
- But Danny never needs to know.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.320
Okay, you have to come clean
and be mature, because--

12:00.420 --> 12:01.989
- Oh, my God! Oh! Oh!
- Ah!

12:02.089 --> 12:04.958
(Tamra)
I'm so glad we're getting rid
of Dr. Bergdahl.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.227
That guy better not ask me
to write him a recommendation.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.461
I mean, I will, but--

12:08.561 --> 12:10.063
Wait a minute,
what the hell is that?

12:12.265 --> 12:13.233
It's Dr. B.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.734
Oh, my God, is he dead?

12:15.836 --> 12:16.937
(Tamra)
All his clothes are hanging
in the backseat,

12:17.938 --> 12:19.306
he's grumpy all the time,
and he smells bad.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.874
Dude is living
out of his car.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.076
That's why he's hoarding
the bagels--he's broke.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.312
And thanks to us,
Dr. Reed's gonna fire him.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.781
Gosh, I've never felt
this guilty before,

12:27.881 --> 12:29.016
and I'm the one
who told de Blasio

12:29.116 --> 12:30.350
not to care
what the po-po thinks.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.351
We need--

12:31.451 --> 12:33.120
- Ohh.
- Really?

12:39.860 --> 12:42.830
[piano music]

12:42.930 --> 12:50.871
*

12:52.072 --> 12:53.807
Can you believe the turnout
at this party?

12:53.907 --> 12:54.975
Oh, yeah.

12:55.976 --> 12:56.009
There's more people here
than were at my trial.

12:56.844 --> 12:57.444
I placed an ad for the clinic
on Goop.

12:58.211 --> 12:58.946
Oh, my God,
that's a great idea.

12:59.746 --> 13:00.347
It cost 10 grand,
would've paid 20.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.448
What?

13:01.548 --> 13:03.116
Relax, don't worry,
we'll expense it.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.451
I pay for the expenses.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.153
You and I are the only people
who work here.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.988
You gotta take this up
with business affairs.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.089
I'm business affairs.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.090
I'm gonna go get you
some lobster.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.091
Chill out.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.359
You got lobster?

13:12.459 --> 13:13.360
[mutters]

13:13.460 --> 13:14.928
Okay.

13:15.028 --> 13:15.929
Hey, Dan.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.164
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.199
Hey, look, man, I always knew
that we were close friends,

13:20.267 --> 13:21.501
but I always used to think
that all we had in common

13:21.601 --> 13:23.837
were good looks
and brain smarts.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.338
You're Lou, right?

13:25.438 --> 13:26.306
Yeah.
Hey, look, man,

13:26.406 --> 13:29.076
we can do anything
that regular guys can do.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.143
Yeah, I never thought
I couldn't.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.312
Hey, that's the spirit, chief.
Hey, you know what?

13:32.345 --> 13:32.379
You and me are gonna grab
a couple of motorcycles,

13:34.447 --> 13:36.816
file off the serial numbers,
head down to Baja,

13:36.917 --> 13:38.018
see what kind of trouble
we can get into.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.087
Couple of masculine guys
like us, right?

13:40.187 --> 13:43.156
Uh, maybe you should leave
that sort of thing for Morgan.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.458
No, no, no, he wouldn't
understand our situation.

13:45.558 --> 13:49.062
You and I, we're cousins now.
Cousin Dan.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.264
Hey, Cousin Dan.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.437
This is so exciting.

13:57.537 --> 14:00.240
When I heard your story,
I had to come see for myself.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.977
A pregnant Indian-American woman
starting her own business.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.313
I'm hoping that they do
a documentary series about me.

14:06.413 --> 14:09.349
I mean, it's so brave
that your boyfriend is so public

14:09.449 --> 14:10.383
about his problem.

14:10.483 --> 14:13.220
Most men would be mortified.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.989
[chuckles]
Yeah.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.494
(Morgan)
Go, go, go, go.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.096
- Hey.
- Hey, there you are.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.098
When we told you
to fire Dr. Bergdahl,

14:25.198 --> 14:27.000
you weren't dumb enough
to listen to us, were you?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.635
Yeah,
you cannot fire Dr. B.

14:28.735 --> 14:32.105
You insisted that I fire him,
so I f--I fired him.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.506
- Oh! Damn it!
- Oh.

14:33.606 --> 14:34.641
You really
stepped in it now.

14:35.575 --> 14:36.977
Do you know the guy is
living in his car?

14:38.178 --> 14:39.246
Yeah, just goes to show you,
hot guys have problems too.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.513
What are you talking about?

14:40.613 --> 14:43.416
He's living in squalor.
He's a total Beverly.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.919
I didn't want to get rid of him
in the first place,

14:46.019 --> 14:49.022
but if you want to hire him
back, please, go hire him back.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.924
- Yes!
- Yes! Go.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.525
Can we hire anyone
or just him?

14:52.625 --> 14:54.061
Just him!
Just him.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.262
Okay.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.099
Everybody, excuse me,

14:59.199 --> 15:00.900
I'm sorry--
sorry to interrupt the night.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.635
Just gather around
just a minute,

15:02.735 --> 15:04.304
grab a glass.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.939
It's a really,
really important night,

15:06.039 --> 15:07.240
and I just want
to say a few words

15:07.340 --> 15:08.641
about an honest,
hardworking woman.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.077
Sorry, excuse me.
Hey.

15:10.177 --> 15:11.311
You don't need to do this.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.445
In fact, I think we should go.

15:12.545 --> 15:13.313
This party's lame as hell.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.048
Hey, babe, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.150
I want to take
this opportunity

15:17.250 --> 15:19.919
to congratulate the mother
of my child, Mindy Lahiri.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.522
How she pulled this off
all on her own,

15:22.622 --> 15:23.623
I can't even conceive.

15:23.723 --> 15:24.992
Oh, no.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.259
That was then.
You can now.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.394
She didn't need me.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.197
This all started with this guy
in San Francisco.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.198
Actually, he was
a friend of mine.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.199
Oh, God.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.233
Very cool.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.468
She came back, boom,
the seed was planted.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.936
Okay, that's good.

15:38.105 --> 15:38.138
Thank you very much, honey.
Those were such great words.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.373
Why don't you go wait in
the elevator and grab our coats?

15:41.341 --> 15:42.075
Okay, well, I'm not
actually done talking.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.511
I just want to say
a few more things.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.346
I'm honored
to sit on the sidelines.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.149
I'll sit on the sidelines
as she grows and grows,

15:49.249 --> 15:51.118
and I watch her,
and she's growing.

15:51.218 --> 15:52.219
You're a good man.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.654
I would like
to make a toast.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.589
Just pop this out here.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.292
Watch out, guys,
this thing's gonna pop.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.362
(all)
Oh.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.663
You gotta be kidding me.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.066
That's funny, I just popped
a cork, and nothing came out.

16:06.933 --> 16:07.734
Don't worry,
happens to the best of us.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.037
To Mindy Lahiri.
Salud.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.071
(all) Salud.
- Mindy.

16:11.971 --> 16:12.005
You want me to say
anything else? You good?

16:12.872 --> 16:13.473
No, no, that's great.
Yeah, thank you.

16:14.574 --> 16:14.607
- Okay, all right. I'm gonna--
- Go to the corner.

16:15.475 --> 16:15.508
- Don't talk to anybody.
- Okay, yeah.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.146
I want to encourage
everyone here to, you know,

16:19.246 --> 16:21.281
keep to themselves
and maybe not talk

16:21.381 --> 16:23.316
about things like
who impregnated who

16:23.416 --> 16:26.119
or who is infertile
and who isn't.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.420
Mindy said I what?

16:29.789 --> 16:31.224
Oh, God.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.529
I got her pregnant
all by myself.

16:36.629 --> 16:37.530
You know what,
it was a total accident.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.765
Honey!

16:39.932 --> 16:41.168
Everything I know about your
reproductive health is a lie!

16:42.035 --> 16:42.402
Okay,
that's a little dramatic, Lou.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.371
I took a drama class
at the Y.

16:45.338 --> 16:45.372
Does everybody here
want to hear the story

16:46.239 --> 16:46.273
of how it happened
with me and Mindy?

16:47.006 --> 16:48.175
I'll tell you
how it happened.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.143
It was
a beautifully romantic night.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.545
He made me
a gorgeous candlelit dinner,

16:52.645 --> 16:55.648
and then, holding my hand,
he took my virginity.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.650
That's how I became pregnant
with this little guy.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.552
No, it was New Year's Eve,
Times Square.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.088
Mindy and I are there,
and I'm feeling good

17:01.121 --> 17:01.154
'cause I just estimated
my tax returns.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.192
She's got the 2015 glasses on,
and she looks hot.

17:05.292 --> 17:06.193
Oh.

17:06.293 --> 17:07.560
The next thing you know,

17:08.828 --> 17:09.462
we're knocking boots
under the Lion King billboard.

17:10.730 --> 17:11.631
I guess we were a little
Hakuna Matata about protection.

17:12.432 --> 17:12.799
I should have been
more Matata!

17:13.233 --> 17:15.034
[all murmuring]

17:15.135 --> 17:18.538
I'm gonna get a slice.

17:18.638 --> 17:19.572
You know what?

17:19.672 --> 17:22.475
You're a real scumbag,
and that's coming from me.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.544
(Sandra)
Let's get out of here.

17:24.644 --> 17:25.378
Well--

17:28.415 --> 17:31.651
Oh, no, no, no, no.
We're too late!

17:31.751 --> 17:33.653
That's how Grandma looked
when she swallowed her tongue!

17:33.753 --> 17:35.388
We gotta save him!

17:35.488 --> 17:37.290
Ah!
What the hell?

17:37.390 --> 17:38.425
Oh, my God. I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.

17:38.525 --> 17:41.494
What--you got the--

17:41.594 --> 17:43.096
What are you doing?

17:43.130 --> 17:43.163
You get me fired,
you break my window,

17:44.764 --> 17:46.633
and then you wake me up
from a good dream?

17:46.733 --> 17:48.568
I got hit by a city snowplow,

17:48.668 --> 17:50.603
and I was living
off the settlement money, man.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.405
It was like
a dream come true.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.442
Look, Dr. Bergdahl, we're not
here to antagonize you.

17:55.542 --> 17:56.709
We actually
got you rehired.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.512
Also, we've decided to be
our most Oprah selves,

17:59.612 --> 18:01.414
and we're gonna give you
all of our fund-raiser money.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.283
What?
Come on.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.585
You're actually gonna
give me $250,000?

18:05.685 --> 18:06.753
No way.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.289
It's $187, but the gesture
is just as generous.

18:10.423 --> 18:10.857
Also, all the money's pledged,
so if you really want it,

18:11.758 --> 18:12.392
you probably have to call
and follow up--

18:13.426 --> 18:15.528
Oh, it's very nice of you,
but I can't accept.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.863
(Morgan)
Hey, why don't you stay
at Dr. L's?

18:16.963 --> 18:19.166
She has an apartment
she doesn't even use.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.700
Hey, can I ask you
a random question?

18:20.800 --> 18:23.570
Why would a successful doctor
need to sleep in a car?

18:23.670 --> 18:27.674
I'm kind of on the outs
with my wife, Alice.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.841
It's why I'm not staying
at my place,

18:28.941 --> 18:31.344
and yes, I could probably
go get a place of my own,

18:31.444 --> 18:34.847
but I feel like that would
kind of be admitting

18:34.947 --> 18:37.817
that my marital problems are
more than just temporary, so--

18:37.917 --> 18:39.286
That's it,
that's all my dirt,

18:39.386 --> 18:40.687
you got it all,
so I hope you're happy.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.222
My turn.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.823
Pretty sure
my grandmother's my mom.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.292
No, I don't need
to hear this, really.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.594
But I do want to apologize
to you, Tanya,

18:47.694 --> 18:50.263
and you too, Mervin,
and especially you, Madison.

18:50.363 --> 18:53.500
Well, it's about time
you learned our names.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.867
No.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.208
[sniffs]

19:01.308 --> 19:02.209
Adrian's coming.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.276
[door opens]

19:03.376 --> 19:04.911
Hey, Mindy,
I've been thinking,

19:05.011 --> 19:07.146
and I've decided
I'm gonna give all my patients

19:07.247 --> 19:09.349
the hard sell to go
to your fertility practice.

19:09.449 --> 19:10.783
Really?

19:10.883 --> 19:13.486
Is it because,
in your short time here...

19:13.586 --> 19:15.822
[straining] I've become
a kind of mentor to you?

19:15.922 --> 19:17.290
What?
No.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.559
It's because you have
an apartment you never use.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.161
So you let me crash there,
I give you patients.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.930
Ooh, horse trading.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.432
We're like
two fat-cat politicians

19:25.532 --> 19:27.900
smoking cigars
in a political cartoon.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.770
You know, I do have a sash
that says "Wall Street."

19:30.870 --> 19:32.205
Yeah.
Do we have a deal?

19:32.305 --> 19:35.342
Yeah.
We have a deal.

19:35.442 --> 19:38.177
You can stay at my apartment
as long as you want.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.213
And you can use
whatever you like.

19:40.313 --> 19:43.850
You know, my TV, my shower,
my stereo, my shower.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.318
I get it, I get it.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.653
There's a spy cam
in the shower.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.256
Don't worry,
I'll put on a show.

19:56.396 --> 19:59.766
Hey, made your favorite dessert,
cut-up apple.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.902
I don't like apples anymore.
My friends all know that.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.704
Okay.
That's obviously not true.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.840
I saw you eating an apple
earlier today.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.476
Look, I'm sorry.

20:09.576 --> 20:12.312
How could you spread lies
about my guy?

20:12.412 --> 20:13.513
My guy's the best.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.916
Sweetheart, I am really,
really sorry.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.319
To think that I spoke ill
of an organ that has brought

20:19.419 --> 20:21.321
so much happiness to me
and other women--

20:21.421 --> 20:22.489
Too many women.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.491
Oh, God, why did I go
down this path?

20:24.591 --> 20:26.726
You know...

20:26.826 --> 20:28.861
it's just, this new practice
makes me nervous.

20:28.961 --> 20:32.399
I mean, we're both
always really busy,

20:32.499 --> 20:35.568
but I could always
see you at work,

20:35.668 --> 20:39.306
and now I can't
count on that anymore.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.412
Well, if you want to see
more of me,

20:45.512 --> 20:46.679
I have some good news.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.615
What?

20:48.715 --> 20:50.983
I think I'm ready
to move in.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.685
You are?

20:56.022 --> 20:58.325
- That's fantastic.
- [chuckles]

20:58.425 --> 21:00.427
That's fantastic.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.629
Do you really want to move in,
or is this just an excuse

21:02.729 --> 21:04.364
not to clean your place?

21:04.464 --> 21:05.498
Uh, it's a little bit of both.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.734
- Okay.
- But I found a perfect tenant.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.936
He stinks real bad,
and he doesn't pay rent.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.704
- Bergdahl.
- Mm-hmm.

21:11.804 --> 21:15.408
Now, what do you think about us
having a housewarming party

21:15.508 --> 21:17.610
even though I'm just moving
into my boyfriend's apartment?

21:17.710 --> 21:18.678
Absolutely not.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.648
We have to rethink
the decor in here.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.450
I was thinking
Arabian Nights.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.984
No, no, too political.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.853
Okay, Moulin Rouge.

21:26.953 --> 21:27.854
No.

21:27.954 --> 21:28.855
Romeo and Juliet?

21:28.955 --> 21:30.657
- Nope.
- Great Gatsby?

21:30.757 --> 21:32.525
Okay, enough
with Baz Luhrmann.
