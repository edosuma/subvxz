WEBVTT

00:05.806 --> 00:09.008
You have to give me the number
of your window washer.

00:09.010 --> 00:11.710
Yeah. He's very good.
And very good price.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.679
Your windows will be
the death of many a bird.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.281
- All done, Mr. Kim.
- Ah!

00:16.283 --> 00:17.349
Great job.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.417
Mmm? Yeah.

00:18.419 --> 00:21.186
You not have trouble
with window bar?

00:21.188 --> 00:23.068
No. I rigged up a special
squeegee just for you.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.857
Mmm. Good.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.660
See, what I did was,
I took an old squeegee,

00:28.662 --> 00:30.529
Then epoxied it
to a ball joint on a pole,

00:30.531 --> 00:32.464
That way I can really
get in there, you know.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.233
Okay. See you.

00:35.669 --> 00:36.835
Okay.

00:42.777 --> 00:44.676
You know,
he was waiting for a tip.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.178
Why I tip?

00:46.180 --> 00:47.379
You said he did a great job.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.348
Yeah, that's why I pay.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.849
He wants more money,
he charge more.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.385
That's not how society works.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.720
Take my restaurant,
for example.

00:54.722 --> 00:57.222
I pay my waiters
an unlivable wage.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.924
It's unlivable!

00:58.926 --> 01:02.561
But they get their tips,
and somehow they survive.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.430
Yeah,
that's a problem nowadays.

01:04.432 --> 01:05.731
Everybody wants a tip.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.401
Taxi driver wants a tip.
Pizza delivery wants a tip.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.537
What's next?
Astronaut wants a tip?

01:11.539 --> 01:13.205
You know they drink
their own urine.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.240
Keep the change.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.876
Okay. Thank you!

01:19.146 --> 01:20.345
What?

01:20.481 --> 01:22.648
My boss pay me
unlivable wage, too.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.286
And so it begins.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.652
That was
a most beautiful service.

02:00.654 --> 02:01.720
Thank you.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.455
So sad for Mrs. Ko.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.524
Yeah, she love her husband
very much.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.326
But at 84,
he lived a good life.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.394
And he is
in good resting place.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.562
Mmm-hmm.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.898
Not best resting place,
but still very good.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.601
What is more important
is where he's going.

02:15.603 --> 02:18.570
Yeah. We are lucky. And smart.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.672
We buy good spot here
long time ago.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.040
- Come, see.
- No.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.043
<i>Yeobo,</i> today is not our day.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.945
Today is Mrs. Ko's day.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.281
And I should probably
be getting back to the family.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.584
Or they can wait.
They're not going anywhere.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.886
- Oh... Come, come.
- But...

02:36.323 --> 02:37.589
It is a beautiful spot.

02:37.591 --> 02:38.857
Perfect spot.

02:38.859 --> 02:42.694
Close to church,
surround by friend.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.898
One day,
- this will be our home.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.634
But not today.

02:48.636 --> 02:51.737
Also, we have
a very expensive brass plaque.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.805
Good deal. Two for one.

02:53.807 --> 02:54.873
That's great.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.375
No one loves saving
more than Jesus.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.776
Ah!

02:57.778 --> 02:59.878
"Kim Sang Il," and...

02:59.880 --> 03:02.381
Oh, is Lois Johnson
your English name?

03:02.383 --> 03:03.982
Why my plaque say
"Lois Johnson"?

03:04.451 --> 03:06.718
- I don't know.
- Who is Lois Johnson?

03:06.720 --> 03:09.588
And why she have
my resting place?

03:09.590 --> 03:10.889
I know a Lois Martin.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.425
But I don't think
that's helpful right now.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.504
What technique!
Two at a time, bitches.

03:25.673 --> 03:26.972
Two at a time.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.640
- Two at a time!
- Two at a time!

03:28.642 --> 03:29.675
I don't get it.

03:29.677 --> 03:30.809
You kidding me, t-bag?

03:30.811 --> 03:32.778
You've never seen
<i>Blood and Bone?</i>

03:32.779 --> 03:34.746
It's only the coolest
martial arts movie, ever.

03:35.049 --> 03:37.683
"Your man as good
as he says he is?"

03:37.685 --> 03:38.884
"double or nothing."

03:39.687 --> 03:41.019
all right.

03:43.691 --> 03:44.823
Whoa!

03:44.825 --> 03:46.825
- I said, "double or nothing."
- okay.

03:46.827 --> 03:47.893
That all you...

03:50.798 --> 03:52.231
Whoo! Yeah!

03:52.633 --> 03:54.166
Now do the <i>dirty dancing</i> lift.

03:54.168 --> 03:56.168
- Dude, you okay?
- Yeah. Fine.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.703
You sure?
You landed pretty hard.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.771
No, I'm good.
Just lost my footing.

03:59.773 --> 04:00.839
No, you were pretty steady.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.507
Well, until
Kimchee flipped you.

04:02.910 --> 04:03.976
I filmed it. Check it out.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.611
Sweet.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.145
Oh, I'm calling my mom.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.648
Hi, mom. Can't talk right now.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.010
I'm just recording
a fight at work.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.486
How they can sell
my resting place?

04:14.488 --> 04:15.587
Yeah. Crazy.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.456
We go to cemetery manager
right now.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.524
You play bad cop,
I play worse cop.

04:19.526 --> 04:21.059
Yeah, okay, we will. Ha.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.128
But first, funny story.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.530
Uh, you remember
summer of '97?

04:25.532 --> 04:27.199
So hot. Huh?

04:27.201 --> 04:29.601
Jung was six,
he got heat rash.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.969
We think he has chicken pox.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.672
Chicken pox
is very scary disease.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.675
Then walk-in cooler
break down,

04:36.677 --> 04:39.311
But everybody still wants
a pop and Gatorade.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.281
Watermelon flavor
was very popular then.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.649
It's too sweet for me.

04:43.651 --> 04:44.916
What did you do?

04:46.553 --> 04:47.953
I sell resting place
to get money

04:47.955 --> 04:50.122
To fix cooler
and to save family.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.757
You're welcome.

04:52.259 --> 04:54.026
You sell my resting place?

04:54.028 --> 04:55.327
I was going to buy back.

04:55.329 --> 04:58.030
But then Janet is born,
and we need a stroller.

04:58.032 --> 04:59.898
Then the roof leaked
and I fix roof.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.100
- Then I fall through roof...
- You never tell me!

05:02.102 --> 05:04.169
Yeah! I fall through
almost two floors.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.937
Why you sell my resting place?

05:05.939 --> 05:07.639
I tried to sell both.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.141
But only yours sell.

05:09.777 --> 05:10.909
Also, I thinking,

05:10.911 --> 05:12.911
If you die first,
you not know,

05:12.913 --> 05:14.246
So we don't have a big fight.

05:14.248 --> 05:15.947
And if you die first?

05:15.949 --> 05:17.282
Then I is dead.

05:17.284 --> 05:20.218
And you is too sad
for big fight.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.286
Win-win.

05:21.689 --> 05:22.821
Lose-lose.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.899
So? Did you love it?

05:33.901 --> 05:36.802
I'm sorry,
but that is not my Archie.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.604
Your Archie?

05:38.605 --> 05:40.405
Yeah, Archie is supposed to be
this lovable freckle-face.

05:40.407 --> 05:42.708
He's not supposed to be
all brooding angles.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.276
And those abs? Come on.

05:44.278 --> 05:46.044
No one has abs like that.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.347
Yeah. Ridiculous.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.115
So do you wanna watch
another one?

05:50.117 --> 05:51.817
No, you go ahead. I'm beat.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.418
Okay. Good night.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.795
Janet, your phone.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.163
You got a message.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.225
- Morning.
- Hey.

06:34.328 --> 06:36.261
Mmm. Oh.

06:37.331 --> 06:39.197
Oh, god. Mmm.

06:39.366 --> 06:40.832
So good.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.300
Mmm.

06:43.437 --> 06:46.438
I'm going to leave for school.

06:46.807 --> 06:47.939
With the orange juice?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.125
Right.

06:50.126 --> 06:51.342
Give me a few minutes
and I'll walk with you.

06:51.345 --> 06:53.211
Okay, but...

07:00.120 --> 07:03.188
I'm just gonna... Bye.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.562
Gerald?

07:22.109 --> 07:25.043
- He looks so dumb.
- Play it again.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.248
Oh!

07:30.250 --> 07:32.851
Hey. Don't you guys
have work to do?

07:32.853 --> 07:34.085
- Not really.
- You wanna see?

07:34.087 --> 07:35.520
No, Terence, I don't.

07:35.522 --> 07:36.588
And you would never
have flipped me,

07:36.590 --> 07:38.023
If I'd been on my game.

07:38.392 --> 07:40.358
- Are you still on that?
- You flipped him?

07:40.360 --> 07:42.928
It's no big deal.
But yeah. I totally did.

07:42.930 --> 07:43.995
Oh, I gotta see that.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.096
Wait, so,
what are you watching?

07:45.098 --> 07:47.132
Dog eating a lemon.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.167
It's so sour,
but he can't stop licking it.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.236
- Show me the flip.
- It was a fluke.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.971
Okay, if you say so, bro.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.006
I do say so, bro.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.375
- Are you serious?
- I got it.

07:57.377 --> 07:59.244
No videos at work, Terence.

07:59.379 --> 08:02.280
And clean up these counters.
They're an embarrassment.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.527
Now, why you putting dip
over there,

08:15.529 --> 08:16.995
Where customer can't find?

08:16.997 --> 08:20.365
It's "chip and dip."
they belong together.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.234
So, this one you
want together,

08:22.236 --> 08:23.969
Side by side,
forever and ever?

08:23.971 --> 08:25.570
It just me you throw away
like old garbage?

08:25.572 --> 08:27.138
What did you do now?

08:27.140 --> 08:28.206
How you know I do something?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.242
Maybe Umma do something
this time.

08:30.244 --> 08:32.677
Your Appa want to lie down
next to other woman.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.146
- Appa?
- -Not now. When I die.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.214
Ew!

08:36.216 --> 08:37.983
Appa sell my resting place
in cemetery.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.119
Oh.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.254
Now cemetery is full
and perfect place is gone,

08:42.256 --> 08:45.123
Because Appa want to sell
watermelon Gatorade!

08:45.125 --> 08:47.559
Not just watermelon,
many flavour.

08:47.561 --> 08:50.662
Strawberry, lemon, blue...

08:50.664 --> 08:54.332
okay, okay,
I make big mistake.

08:54.601 --> 08:55.767
But now I fix.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.336
Umma take my resting place.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.838
And you row boat
to middle of lake

08:59.840 --> 09:01.139
And push me over.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.274
Plop!

09:02.276 --> 09:03.441
You want me to drown you
in the lake?

09:03.443 --> 09:06.311
No, not drowning,
I'm already die.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.747
You just have to drag my body
to boat and... Plop!

09:08.749 --> 09:10.482
See? I solve the problem.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.350
You just make problem.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.519
You pollute lake
with your dead body

09:14.521 --> 09:16.288
And we still not together!

09:16.290 --> 09:17.422
So, we sell other grave

09:17.424 --> 09:19.424
And throw your body
into lake, too.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.092
I don't want
a resting place in lake!

09:23.263 --> 09:24.763
You guys know
the store's open, right?

09:25.299 --> 09:27.232
You buy resting place back

09:27.234 --> 09:29.134
So we can be together

09:29.136 --> 09:32.837
Forever and ever
in eternal happiness.

09:37.511 --> 09:39.210
Kill me now.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.278
Plop.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.654
Okay, Janet, we're going.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.456
Are you okay, Appa?

09:51.692 --> 09:54.459
- My neck. Very tight.
- Me, too.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.194
But I've been using
the neck massager.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.430
Yeah, I should do
<i>massagee-kigae.</i>

09:58.432 --> 09:59.864
You don't deserve
<i>massagee-kigae.</i>

09:59.866 --> 10:01.466
You make me sleep on couch

10:01.468 --> 10:03.335
And I don't deserve
<i>massagee-kigae?</i>

10:03.337 --> 10:04.536
No.

10:04.538 --> 10:06.237
- Okay, bye, Janet.
- Okay.

10:06.607 --> 10:07.739
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.808
Hi, Mrs. Kim. Mr. Kim.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.843
- Gerald.
- -You look terrible.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.211
Thank you.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.579
Umma:
Are you getting enough sleep?

10:14.581 --> 10:15.747
Not lately. No.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.649
Maybe he is sleeping
on the couch.

10:17.884 --> 10:20.719
You know what help
you relax and feel good?

10:20.721 --> 10:22.754
<i>Massagee-kigae.</i>
Janet is doing.

10:22.756 --> 10:23.888
A lot lately.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.490
I pretty much need it
to fall asleep now.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.026
Okay.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.294
Where you going?

10:29.296 --> 10:30.528
I go upstairs to
<i>massagee-kigae.</i>

10:30.530 --> 10:31.830
No time! You take too long.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.299
- I do fast one.
- We have to go.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.567
This is all you fault.

10:35.569 --> 10:37.636
I don't have to
<i>massagee-kigae</i> so bad

10:37.638 --> 10:39.537
If you don't kick me
out of bed.

10:39.539 --> 10:42.407
Here, take cream
and do in car.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.759
I help you.

10:44.760 --> 10:46.960
Your hand is too cold
and you squeeze it too hard.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.583
Did you want use the bathroom
before we...

10:51.585 --> 10:52.751
No, not at all.

10:56.590 --> 10:58.056
Appa:
So like I say, Mrs. Johnson,

10:58.692 --> 11:01.826
My wife is pregnant,
walk-in cooler break...

11:01.828 --> 11:03.561
That's quite a story.

11:03.563 --> 11:06.431
Now, would you be so kind
as to get Arthur’s medication?

11:06.867 --> 11:07.999
And have you found out

11:08.001 --> 11:10.435
Who stole Lois'
walking sticks?

11:10.437 --> 11:12.070
No. No. We don't work here.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.439
His shoes say you do.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.509
I know a nurse's shoe
when I see one.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.878
No, just comfortable.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.113
You try standing
for 12-hour day.

11:22.549 --> 11:25.517
- I can't stand.
- Not without her sticks.

11:25.652 --> 11:29.020
Mrs. Johnson,
we own convenience store.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.057
We work together
side by side whole life.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.992
And when we die,

11:34.194 --> 11:37.696
We want to rest together
side by side, too.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.664
How sweet.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.866
We want to buy your plot

11:41.868 --> 11:44.969
Because it's next
to one we have.

11:44.971 --> 11:47.055
I see.

11:47.056 --> 11:49.140
You believe that soul mates
should be buried together.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.442
Yeah.

11:50.444 --> 11:52.010
I cannot disagree.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.212
I know this isn't what
you came here for,

11:54.214 --> 11:56.815
But I think it may
solve your problem.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.016
What you saying?

11:58.018 --> 12:00.752
I would like to buy your plot,

12:00.754 --> 12:04.089
So that Arthur and I
can be buried together.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.523
Oh, Lois.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.526
Of course I'll pay you
very generously.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.495
No, no, no,
we're not interest...

12:10.497 --> 12:11.996
How generously?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.134
And my cousin
got us in for free

12:16.136 --> 12:17.635
'cause he knows a guy.

12:17.637 --> 12:19.604
Hey, lunch buddies.
Got room for one more?

12:19.606 --> 12:20.638
Sure.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.806
Wow.
That looks super healthy.

12:21.808 --> 12:23.108
Yeah, it is.

12:23.110 --> 12:26.211
Part of my new
clean eating plan.

12:28.482 --> 12:31.049
Do you ever dip your fries
in mayo? It's so good.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.951
Very European.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.153
- Need some help with that?
- Yeah.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.855
I got it, I got it.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.523
Oh. Thanks.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.896
Hey, see if you can
flip it open.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.568
Maybe run it under hot water?

12:50.570 --> 12:51.636
I think it's cold water.

12:51.638 --> 12:52.937
Try tapping it with a knife.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.140
Oh, he don't need no knife.
It's Jung.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.243
Is there honey in this thing?

12:58.245 --> 12:59.911
Sometimes if there's honey,

12:59.912 --> 13:01.578
It kind of glues
the whole thing together.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.082
- My hands are slippery.
- Maybe you're just nervous.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.617
Maybe it's because
I moisturize.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.185
You know what, I'm not even
that hungry anymore.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.988
I'm just enjoying
the smell of the fries.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.126
You know what,
I'm gonna wipe my hands.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.331
Oh, thank you.

13:21.668 --> 13:22.734
Who opened it?

13:22.736 --> 13:23.868
It doesn't matter
who did what,

13:23.870 --> 13:25.036
Or how fast
it popped right open.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.172
The important thing is
I'm having lunch.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.841
Do you just wanna
share everything?
Might as well.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.317
Oops.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.619
I dropped my keys.

13:43.323 --> 13:47.325
I'm just heading
into the kitchen right now.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.693
And...

13:48.695 --> 13:49.761
Oh.

13:49.896 --> 13:51.262
Hey.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.464
I'm not interrupting anything?

13:55.101 --> 13:56.918
What?

13:56.919 --> 13:58.736
I just thought that after
a long day you might

13:58.738 --> 14:01.105
Be unwinding or...

14:01.107 --> 14:03.708
Why are you being so weird?

14:03.710 --> 14:05.694
Uh...

14:05.695 --> 14:07.679
Okay, I don't know
if it's a cultural thing,

14:07.681 --> 14:10.081
Maybe your family
is just really open about it,

14:10.083 --> 14:11.349
But I think we need

14:11.351 --> 14:14.252
To establish some boundaries
around self

14:15.422 --> 14:16.921
Exploration.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.224
What are you talking about?

14:19.225 --> 14:21.259
I think if we are gonna
<i>massagee-kigae</i> ourselves,

14:21.261 --> 14:23.328
We should wait until the other
person isn't home.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.929
If the person is home,

14:24.931 --> 14:29.934
Then definitely stifle
the <i>massagee-kigae</i> -ing.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.738
What do you think
<i>massagee-kigae</i> is?

14:33.740 --> 14:34.839
Um...

14:34.841 --> 14:38.309
Massaging your <i>kigae?</i>

14:38.311 --> 14:40.411
Oh, my god, Gerald!

14:41.948 --> 14:43.748
This is a <i>massagee-kigae!</i>

14:43.750 --> 14:47.018
I'm not going to lie.
I find that very intimidating.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.786
It's a neck massager.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.390
Oh! Um...

14:52.893 --> 14:53.958
Never mind.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.262
I feel stupid.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.747
No, don't.

14:58.748 --> 15:00.231
In theory, it could have been
what you thought.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.901
I mean, we're both adults.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.136
Yeah, we're both mature.

15:05.138 --> 15:08.506
- And that's just a normal...
- Thing.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.074
Yeah.

15:10.076 --> 15:14.178
Fun fact. Self-pleasuring
helps prevent prostate cancer.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.348
Not that that's the only
reason one might do it...

15:17.350 --> 15:18.416
No, absolutely.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.118
Boredom, procrastination,

15:20.120 --> 15:21.786
Once actually just 'cause
I was hungry,

15:21.788 --> 15:23.054
But it didn't really help.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.289
Can we talk
about something else?

15:24.291 --> 15:25.356
Not while you're holding that.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.424
Yeah, I'll put it away.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.467
Hey, mister.
Is everything okay?

15:36.469 --> 15:37.919
Yeah. It's good.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.370
Just seems like
you've been in here all day.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.584
Haven't seen you out and about
with the rest of the gang.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.175
- Just workin'. Catchin' up.
- Okay.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.144
I'll leave you to it.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.545
It's just...

15:47.881 --> 15:49.881
it's stupid.
You've probably heard.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.050
About...

15:52.051 --> 15:53.551
Kimchee and I, goofin'
around the other day.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.086
Flipping each other.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.387
Well, he flipped me.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.289
Oh, my god. Are you all right?

15:58.291 --> 15:59.924
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.726
Okay. Good.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.428
But then I was worried
that everyone thought...

16:03.430 --> 16:05.897
'cause they were all laughing
at the video.

16:05.899 --> 16:07.365
Oh, of Kimchee flipping you?

16:07.367 --> 16:09.901
- No, a dog eating a lemon.
- Oh.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.036
I've seen that. It's so funny.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.371
Anyway, I thought they were
watching a video

16:13.373 --> 16:15.640
Of me, so I got mad at them.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.842
And then there was the whole
thing with the mason jar...

16:18.144 --> 16:19.577
Oh, when sage opened it?

16:20.046 --> 16:21.412
Sage opened it?

16:21.414 --> 16:23.982
So you're upset because
you got into a play fight

16:23.984 --> 16:26.084
With Kimchee,
where he flipped you,

16:26.086 --> 16:27.151
But you didn't get hurt,

16:27.153 --> 16:29.520
And then nobody
laughed at you?

16:30.123 --> 16:32.023
You left out the part
about the jar.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.291
Yeah.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.395
- It's just...
- I really have to pee.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.697
I came in here to be nice,

16:38.698 --> 16:39.998
I didn't know this was going
to be a whole thing.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.566
- Go, go.
- Thank you.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.674
I think we should take
ms. Lois offer.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.409
It's lots of money.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.544
I want to be buried
in our cemetery.

16:53.546 --> 16:54.712
Together. End of story.

16:54.714 --> 16:58.116
But we not buried together
unless we sell.

16:58.118 --> 17:03.021
And whatever cemetery we in,
become our cemetery.

17:03.356 --> 17:07.225
Because we is together,
side by side.

17:07.227 --> 17:10.361
Okay, that got me right here.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.563
- I'm sorry for intruding.
- Then don't.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.365
Okay, I'll be over here.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.501
What you think?

17:16.503 --> 17:18.069
We can buy new plot,

17:18.071 --> 17:20.638
And still have money
to enjoy now.

17:20.640 --> 17:24.208
On new golf club.
Or sewing machine.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.743
Or new golf club.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.346
Enrique:
<i>♪ vacation</i>

17:29.182 --> 17:30.515
<i>♪ vacation ♪</i>

17:31.084 --> 17:32.717
- You understand him?
- I have no idea.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.252
Take her on vacation.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.787
She don't want vacation.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.090
You want vacation?

17:39.092 --> 17:40.158
No.

17:41.327 --> 17:42.627
Never been to Italy.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.295
You want to go?

17:44.297 --> 17:46.264
Oh, I don't know.
Never really think about.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.398
What we even do?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.267
Maybe five day in Venice,

17:49.269 --> 17:51.636
Coffee in st. Mark's square,
overnight in Siena,

17:51.638 --> 17:53.604
Then drive down Amalfi Coast
in convertible.

17:53.606 --> 17:54.705
Hmm.

17:55.141 --> 17:56.841
I feel like
you think about this.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.243
Maybe just a little bit.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.745
We go.

18:01.681 --> 18:02.681
Mmm!

18:10.156 --> 18:11.289
Hey, Kimch.

18:12.158 --> 18:13.791
You come here
to loosen all the jars?

18:13.793 --> 18:17.228
I came to apologize.
I'm pretty sure I was an ass.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.163
You were. A big one.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.866
So we good?

18:23.937 --> 18:25.236
Bring it in.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.539
Thanks, man.

18:29.409 --> 18:30.708
But we both know
under normal circumstances,

18:30.710 --> 18:31.776
I would've flipped you.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.544
Interesting.

18:33.546 --> 18:34.779
Would you say

18:34.781 --> 18:36.714
These circumstances
are normal enough for you?

18:38.318 --> 18:40.018
You can't flip me.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.719
Low center of gravity.
Short guy's secret weapon.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.822
Can't flip you 'cause you're
wrapped around my thigh.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.525
Oh!

18:47.727 --> 18:49.260
Okay.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.112
- Had enough?
- No.

18:51.113 --> 18:52.963
Looks like you guys are
working it out. That's good.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.665
- Let go of me.
- Let go of my leg.

18:54.667 --> 18:55.867
I'll leave you to it.

18:58.538 --> 18:59.770
Come on!

19:04.310 --> 19:05.510
Hello?

19:06.346 --> 19:09.114
Oh!

19:09.115 --> 19:11.883
Hello, Mrs. Kim, Mr. Kim,
so good of you to come by.

19:11.885 --> 19:12.950
We have news.

19:12.952 --> 19:15.286
We want to sell Lois our plot.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.387
Oh.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.989
You obviously haven't heard.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.658
Lois passed away last night.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.759
Oh, no.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.462
Oh, no.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.298
We are very sorry
for your loss.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.833
Thank you.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.335
And I'm glad
you've decided to sell.

19:31.337 --> 19:34.305
I intend to honor
Lois' wishes.

19:34.307 --> 19:40.344
Now my retirement income
is a lot more modest
than Lois' was.

19:40.713 --> 19:44.015
And she never did get around
to adding me to her will.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.783
I can't afford very much.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.986
But we all know
it's not about the money.

19:48.988 --> 19:52.356
It's about Lois and I
spending eternity together.

19:52.725 --> 19:55.793
Yeah. But no.

19:55.795 --> 19:56.928
Pardon?

19:56.930 --> 19:58.729
We sorry for you loss,

20:00.400 --> 20:01.465
But no.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.467
But soul mates
belong together.

20:03.469 --> 20:07.104
Yes. But no.

20:08.942 --> 20:11.509
- Okay, see you.
- Bye-bye.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.548
Umma:
In the end we save money.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.718
Appa and I is buried
bunk-bed style.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.653
- In the same grave?
- Yeah.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.956
Whoever die first
is buried bottom bunk.

20:24.958 --> 20:27.458
Whoever die next,
he's buried top bunk.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.863
Oh.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.237
What?
