00:09.940 --> 00:11.692
Brooke:
[realize Jake was no angel,

00:11.710 --> 00:14.235
but he didn ’t deserve
what Seth did to him.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.674
(Screaming)

00:17.680 --> 00:19.773
Brooke, I know
you want answers,

00:19.780 --> 00:21.247
but don't go down
the Branson spiral.

00:21.250 --> 00:23.548
Brooke:
It could be anyone this time.

00:23.550 --> 00:26.713
Emma: .
He’s mess/ng WIth me.
I have to figure this out.

00:26.720 --> 00:30.087
And I really need you
to undeIrsdtand that.
o.

00:31.690 --> 00:33.328
We need to talk.
It's about Emma.

00:33.330 --> 00:35.150
Emma's friend Riley
has been reaching out to me.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.651
Not Riley marra.
She's been emailing me.

00:37.670 --> 00:40.594
And you will never guess
who sent them.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.933
The emails came
from Emma duval?
I brought Piper to lakewood.

00:43.940 --> 00:46.966
Now, I'm paying
for my mistakes.
I deserve this.

00:46.970 --> 00:48.835
I know, I know.
Don't get involved. Whatever.

00:48.840 --> 00:52.970
Screw that! Promise
you'll take no prisoners
and kick ass as needed.

00:52.980 --> 00:55.744
Seth: You're crazy!
Confess to killing Jake,

00:55.750 --> 00:58.719
or say good-bye
to "little Branson."

00:58.720 --> 01:00.688
(Muffled screaming)

01:00.690 --> 01:04.057
Jk. I never want
to see you again.

01:04.060 --> 01:05.948
(Muffled screaming)

01:05.960 --> 01:08.019
(Screaming continues)

01:08.700 --> 01:12.022
(Screaming)

01:15.500 --> 01:18.230
(Gloomy music playing)

01:20.410 --> 01:24.779
(Objects clattering, rustling)

01:26.180 --> 01:30.310
Woman:
there is something
in the look you give

01:30.750 --> 01:34.140
I can ’t help myse/ij
I fall

01:34.160 --> 01:37.357
I can ’t help myself at all

01:37.360 --> 01:41.683
there is something
in your touch when we lass

01:41.700 --> 01:45.295
I scream,
”goo; forgive me, please”

01:45.300 --> 01:48.622
’cause I want you
on your knees

01:49.240 --> 01:54.268
I don ’t want
to think about it now

01:54.280 --> 01:59.741
I know I won ’t get out
ifI fall In

01:59.750 --> 02:04.847
so I don ’t want
to think about it now

02:04.850 --> 02:07.614
. it’s dark _
/n my Imag/nat/on

02:07.620 --> 02:11.784
. it’s dark _
/n my Imag/nat/on

02:14.330 --> 02:18.790
but I don ’t want
to think about it now

02:19.670 --> 02:24.494
I don ’t want
to think about it now

02:24.510 --> 02:26.762
I it’s dark I
/n my Imag/nat/on

02:26.770 --> 02:30.228
I it’s dark I

02:30.240 --> 02:33.676
I it’s dark I
/n my Imag/nat/on

02:33.680 --> 02:35.773
I don ’t want
to think about it now

02:35.780 --> 02:39.648
I it’s dark I
/n my Imag/nat/on

02:43.920 --> 02:47.583
(dog barking, faint)

02:51.370 --> 02:54.191
(Phone ringing, vibrating)

02:59.370 --> 03:04.205
(Scoffs)
Leave another message,
Ms. lang.

03:05.480 --> 03:06.708
(Knocking on door)

03:06.710 --> 03:08.871
Are you expecting someone?

03:08.880 --> 03:10.370
No.

03:11.390 --> 03:13.881
Miguel.
Can we come in?

03:13.890 --> 03:15.744
Sure.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.387
I'm glad the two
of you are here.

03:17.390 --> 03:20.848
If it's all right with you,
we'd like to look
at Emma's computer.

03:20.860 --> 03:21.849
My computer?

03:21.860 --> 03:24.351
Why do you need
her computer?

03:24.370 --> 03:27.919
My dad was getting emails
from Riley marra? But she's...

03:27.940 --> 03:30.795
Dead. We know.
And it turns out the emails

03:30.810 --> 03:32.960
were sent from
your computer, Emma.

03:32.970 --> 03:37.270
That's ridiculous.
I... I did not send
those emails.

03:37.280 --> 03:38.702
I didn't say
that you sent them,

03:38.710 --> 03:41.474
but they were sent
from your ip address.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.879
If there's someone
targeting you...

03:42.880 --> 03:45.269
You think someone's
targeting her?

03:45.290 --> 03:46.541
A few points lead to that.

03:46.550 --> 03:48.279
The articles
about Piper's rampage

03:48.290 --> 03:50.679
that Emma found
at the Crescent palms motel,

03:53.430 --> 03:56.752
the incident
at the fairgrounds
last night...

03:56.760 --> 04:00.264
Wait. What incident
at the fairgrounds?

04:00.800 --> 04:02.267
I...

04:03.040 --> 04:04.598
I didn't want to worry you.

04:04.610 --> 04:05.963
Yes. So, these points lead

04:05.970 --> 04:10.304
to someone obsessing over
and stalking Emma.

04:10.310 --> 04:14.599
So, if there's anything
that you haven't told us...

04:14.620 --> 04:16.679
Anything at all...

04:20.520 --> 04:23.910
There is. The farm.

04:26.690 --> 04:30.990
I found a bunch
of old pictures of myself

04:31.000 --> 04:34.561
at Ia faIrm
out on pIkeVIew road.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.701
There was a man there.
It was dark.

04:39.710 --> 04:42.338
I couldn't see his face.
He ran away.

04:42.340 --> 04:46.879
We went back that night.
It was empty. There was nothing.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.677
We just thought
that maybe it wasn't...

04:48.680 --> 04:51.410
A hallucination.
We'll check that out.

04:51.420 --> 04:54.878
But if someone's harassing you,
Emma, we need to know.

04:54.890 --> 04:58.849
Your computer could really
help us find this person.

04:59.730 --> 05:00.685
Yes, sir.

05:00.690 --> 05:02.794
Hey, thanks
for letting me crash.

05:02.800 --> 05:07.464
There's no way I could've
been by myself last night.

05:07.470 --> 05:09.597
Me either, actually.

05:10.040 --> 05:13.430
Man:
so tell your friends
good-bye...

05:13.440 --> 05:15.658
hey... you know
you need to tell Emma

05:15.680 --> 05:17.500
everything you told me
last night, right?

05:17.510 --> 05:19.546
No, there's no way
I'm ever telling her
any of that.

05:19.550 --> 05:22.474
But with everything
that's happened...
i destroyed her life!

05:22.480 --> 05:25.369
Piper destroyed her life.
I brought Piper here!

05:25.390 --> 05:28.712
I get that you're
scared, but...

05:28.720 --> 05:30.608
I understood.
Emma will too.

05:30.620 --> 05:33.680
But you just have
to give her a chance.

05:34.860 --> 05:37.055
Emma's not you, Noah.

05:42.540 --> 05:43.939
I'm starving.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.407
Hey.
Hi.

05:46.410 --> 05:49.800
If you're looking
for Emma, she traded
the early shift with me,

05:49.810 --> 05:52.472
last minute,
and I am so not pissed.

05:52.480 --> 05:53.549
Not looking for Emma.

05:53.550 --> 05:56.144
Uh, we're looking for caffeine
and baked things at the moment.

05:56.150 --> 05:58.948
Which is on me,
for last night.
All right.

05:58.950 --> 06:02.886
Oh, hey, I actually see a spot
opening up on the couch,
so I'm gonna go grab that.

06:02.890 --> 06:06.155
But, uh, get me the usual.
Mocha, coconut, extra shot,

06:06.160 --> 06:09.049
and one of those
yogurt granola things.

06:10.100 --> 06:13.558
Hey,you!
Hey!Hey,Zoe!Hey!

06:13.570 --> 06:15.629
You're here!
I mean, how are you?

06:15.640 --> 06:20.668
I'm great. Normal, actually.
But I'm glad to see you.

06:20.670 --> 06:22.433
Yeah.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.704
So, we have that oral
coming up in applied physics,

06:24.710 --> 06:28.771
and, honestly,
that class has been kicking
my proverbial but as of late.

06:28.780 --> 06:29.974
Yeah, it's triclq.

06:29.980 --> 06:32.119
Um, so I was wondering
if you would be interested

06:32.120 --> 06:36.409
in getting together for
a little study session later?

06:36.420 --> 06:37.785
Hey, Zoe.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.655
Audrey.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.582
So, what do you say?
Like, one-ish?

06:41.600 --> 06:42.919
Of course.
That sounds great.

06:42.930 --> 06:46.127
Uh, you'll pick me up?
I mean, I will pick you up?

06:46.130 --> 06:50.931
No, no, no. I'll pick you up.
I like to drive.

06:50.940 --> 06:52.567
See ya.

06:52.570 --> 06:54.037
Bye.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.001
She likes to drive.
First, shut up.

06:59.010 --> 07:00.944
Second, it's just
a study session.

07:00.950 --> 07:03.475
Okay, study session
or study date?

07:03.480 --> 07:07.746
Oh, my god. Foster,
learn to read a moment
or you Will be a Virgin forever.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.614
I'm more focused
on staying alive.

07:09.620 --> 07:13.021
If we stop living our lives,
we might as well give up
fighting now.

07:13.030 --> 07:15.590
Who knows?
Maybe I'm meant
to die alone.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.455
Will you take your yogurt
and go? You have a date
to get ready for.

07:18.470 --> 07:23.464
It's a study session.
Whatever! Bring protection.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.695
I... I know.

07:25.710 --> 07:27.063
(Chuckles)

07:28.180 --> 07:30.774
I Woman: I
/n Cal/forn/a

07:30.780 --> 07:32.998
so, I was just questioned
by the sheriff.

07:33.010 --> 07:35.979
He wanted to have
a look at my computer.
Wait. Why?

07:35.980 --> 07:38.778
Apparently, someone
has been sending my dad
emails from Riley marra.

07:38.790 --> 07:42.783
What?
And whoever was doing that
sent them from my computer.

07:42.790 --> 07:45.987
That, coupled with
everything that you
just told the sheriff...

07:45.990 --> 07:50.654
(Scoffs)
Kieran, why did you go to him
without talking to me first?

07:50.660 --> 07:53.766
You've been keeping
things from them, okay?
It's dangerous.

07:53.770 --> 07:55.192
That is not what
we agreed to last night.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.691
When you acted
like I could trust you,
when you made me feel safe...

07:57.710 --> 08:00.702
What was that?
Was that just a lie?
No, no. Of course not.

08:00.710 --> 08:05.204
Then, why did you go
to the sheriff without
talking to me first?

08:06.280 --> 08:07.907
You would have
told me not to.

08:07.920 --> 08:14.712
I'd rather have you angry
at me and alive, than dead.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.679
It was for
your own good, em.

08:20.690 --> 08:23.022
For my own good?

08:23.030 --> 08:26.056
Then, why do I feel
so betrayed?

08:29.770 --> 08:33.137
(Car door closing,
engine starting)

08:33.140 --> 08:36.268
Man:
things that
you thought you’d be

08:36.280 --> 08:39.306
shake mediocrity,
you know

08:39.310 --> 08:42.199
’burbs or the streets,
doesn ’t matter. ..

08:42.220 --> 08:44.245
hey! Hey, have you seen Emma?

08:44.250 --> 08:46.639
Wasn't she supposed
to be working this morning?

08:46.650 --> 08:49.039
She was supposed to,
but I haven't.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.878
Are you okay?

08:52.890 --> 08:54.221
I, um...

08:55.230 --> 08:57.027
I think I might've messed up.

08:57.030 --> 08:58.327
That's ominous.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.161
You're dark.
Like, in a good way.

09:00.170 --> 09:02.126
I feel like maybe
you would understand.

09:02.140 --> 09:04.335
That's even more ominous.

09:04.340 --> 09:08.037
So, last night,
i handcuffed Branson to a bed,

09:08.040 --> 09:09.735
threatenIed to_castrate him
With scnssors,

09:09.740 --> 09:11.674
and then left him
trapped in a hotel room.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.568
You went full
hard candy
on Branson

09:13.580 --> 09:16.003
and left him
chained to a bed?

09:16.020 --> 09:17.009
Yeah.

09:17.020 --> 09:19.614
I don't know.
I was just trying
to scare him.

09:19.620 --> 09:21.838
I thought he knew
something about Jake.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.350
Is he still there?

09:25.090 --> 09:28.025
What the hell is that?
It's the key
to the handcuffs.

09:28.030 --> 09:30.692
Oh, wow.
I'm serious.
don't judge me.

09:30.700 --> 09:35.262
No, no, no. Trust me,
I'm in no position
to judge, but...

09:35.270 --> 09:39.593
We definitely need to do
something about this.

09:39.610 --> 09:41.259
Yeah.

09:47.310 --> 09:50.609
Why do you think
it took her so long
to tell us about this place?

09:50.620 --> 09:52.611
Someone's got her scared.

09:58.330 --> 10:01.026
(Door slamming)

10:01.660 --> 10:03.821
(Floors creaking)

10:35.960 --> 10:40.021
This place is about
as abandoned as you'd think
an abandoned farm would be.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.725
(Sighs) Thanks for
humoring me, Dwayne.

10:41.740 --> 10:45.289
Will you radio
the station, let them know
we're on our way back?

10:45.310 --> 10:46.834
Gotcha.

10:50.840 --> 10:52.979
(Line ringing)

10:52.980 --> 10:57.747
It's Miguel.
We have a bigger problem
than we thought.

11:08.800 --> 11:12.896
Thank god you're here.
We've been swamped all morning.

11:18.570 --> 11:20.800
Hey, are you mad
at something?

11:20.810 --> 11:22.937
Yeah, I'm mad at
a lot of things, actually.

11:22.940 --> 11:25.875
Mostly your cousin.
What'd he do now?

11:25.880 --> 11:29.646
He went and told the sheriff
a lot of things behind my back.

11:29.650 --> 11:31.277
Doesn't sound
anything like Kieran.

11:31.290 --> 11:34.282
I don't know. I know
that he was doing it
to protect me,

11:34.290 --> 11:36.349
but I still hate
that he didn't tell me.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.419
Sounds like something
i shouldn't get
in the middle of.

11:38.430 --> 11:42.480
No, trust me,
nothing that you say is
gonna make it any worse.

11:43.500 --> 11:46.867
Okay, so...
The thing with Kieran is,

11:46.870 --> 11:48.929
he keeps stuff buried deep,

11:48.940 --> 11:51.829
like, deeper than usual,
subterranean.

11:51.840 --> 11:55.833
Yeah, I've noticed that.
But he had a really
tough childhood.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.434
His step-dad
never let up on him.

11:58.450 --> 12:03.274
You know his mom and step-dad
died in that car crash, right?

12:03.850 --> 12:04.748
Yeah.

12:04.750 --> 12:05.910
Well, him and his step-dad

12:05.920 --> 12:10.812
got in some huge fight
right before they drove off.

12:10.820 --> 12:12.458
Oh, no.

12:12.460 --> 12:16.487
Kieran still hasn't
forgiven himself
for that fight.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.859
He never told me
about that.

12:19.870 --> 12:23.636
That's probably why
he's so overprotective.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.468
You've noticed?
Yeah, totally.

12:26.470 --> 12:30.076
And then, what happened
with his real dad...

12:30.080 --> 12:32.036
He's lost a lot of people.

12:32.050 --> 12:35.838
He really, really
doesn't want to lose you.

12:37.020 --> 12:42.048
With everything that's going on,
he's probably just scared.

12:44.360 --> 12:49.059
It's getting crazy,
so, um... get to work.
Yeah.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.494
Zoe: Here we are.
Noah: Wow! This is
a really cool spot.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.036
It's my favorite place
to sit and think.

12:58.040 --> 13:01.828
You know I have a kind of
love-hate relationship
with this lake?

13:01.840 --> 13:05.037
I know. I've heard you
wax dark and poetic a lot

13:05.050 --> 13:07.507
about this body of water
on the morgue.

13:07.510 --> 13:11.947
Right! Yeah, you're a fan.
That's really cool. (Chuckles)

13:11.950 --> 13:14.089
I was away during
the whole Piper thing,

13:14.090 --> 13:16.115
so your podcast was
the best way for me

13:16.120 --> 13:17.781
to find out what
you guys went through.

13:17.790 --> 13:19.519
Yeah, you weren't
around last fall.

13:19.530 --> 13:23.796
I was away at a space x
immersion program
all through October.

13:23.800 --> 13:28.624
Wait, you're not talking
about the space x lift bold
thinkers program, are you?

13:28.640 --> 13:32.497
Oh, yeah.
It was amazing.
Wow.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.671
Okay, so, I've applied
to that six times.

13:36.680 --> 13:39.535
It's in June,
not October. So...

13:39.550 --> 13:42.599
How were you there
in the fall?

13:45.420 --> 13:46.512
Okay, I lied.

13:46.520 --> 13:50.012
But the whole space x thing
is way nicer than the truth,

13:50.020 --> 13:53.148
so can we just go
with that, please?

13:57.800 --> 13:59.097
Wait.

14:01.570 --> 14:03.788
I-i didn't mean to make you
feel uncomfortable.

14:03.800 --> 14:07.031
It's totally cool.
You don't have to...

14:07.040 --> 14:09.759
It's none of my business.

14:12.450 --> 14:14.873
There was a moment last fall

14:14.880 --> 14:17.576
when I realized
school was all I had.

14:17.580 --> 14:22.540
I didn't have any friends.
I wasn't a part of anything.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.016
It was pretty lonely.

14:24.020 --> 14:31.597
This crushing
sort of loneliness
out of nowhere. And, um...

14:32.170 --> 14:35.628
One night, I did
something really stupid.

14:37.200 --> 14:40.533
It's not important,
but the result was,

14:40.540 --> 14:44.135
my mom bought me
a therapist,

14:44.140 --> 14:47.940
and, um, I skipped school
for, like, a month.

14:49.480 --> 14:56.215
Trust me... for lakewood,
you're in the shallow end
of hidden mysteries.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.112
Thank you.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.492
(Sniffles, sighs)

15:03.500 --> 15:06.651
I think I have to confess
one more thing.

15:07.970 --> 15:14.068
I actually brought you
here for a date.

15:14.740 --> 15:17.504
And, uh...
I've got swimsuits.

15:17.510 --> 15:18.534
(Both chuckle)

15:18.550 --> 15:20.643
I'm really good at physics,

15:20.650 --> 15:22.242
just less so
at asking boys out.

15:22.250 --> 15:27.916
Zoe, am I to understand
this was all some sort of
elaborate ruse?

15:27.920 --> 15:31.219
I feel like you already
knew that, Mr. foster.

15:32.630 --> 15:35.724
(Phone ringing)

15:37.660 --> 15:40.493
Uh, it's cool.
You should get that.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.665
Nope! I'm good.

15:43.670 --> 15:46.935
You have
my undIVIded attention.

15:46.940 --> 15:48.601
Hey, foster,
if anything happens to me,

15:48.610 --> 15:52.000
it probably has something
to do with Seth Branson.
I'll explain later.

15:52.010 --> 15:54.501
Audrey, you did not have
to come with me, really.

15:54.510 --> 15:57.877
He's gonna be weak
and exhausted.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.009
(Scoffs)
don't judge me.

16:01.020 --> 16:03.784
The point is,
we can take him together.

16:03.790 --> 16:06.714
Right?
Just open the door.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.528
(Door beeps)

16:18.640 --> 16:20.039
Wha...?

16:23.540 --> 16:26.077
No... way.

16:30.580 --> 16:32.946
Okay, this is bad.
I'm not gonna lie.

16:32.950 --> 16:36.078
But Branson was bound
to escape eventually.

16:36.090 --> 16:37.489
Yeah, but where is he?

16:37.490 --> 16:40.015
And who is he telling
about what I did?

16:40.030 --> 16:43.796
And what is this bizarre
little display about?

16:43.800 --> 16:45.620
(Phone dings, vibrates)

16:46.730 --> 16:50.689
It's Branson. (Sighs)
He wants me to meet him later.

16:50.700 --> 16:54.636
Either I apologize or he says
he's gonna turn me in.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.800
Turn you in? He is pissed.

16:55.810 --> 16:59.701
(Sighs)
He even put "apologize"
in quotation marks.

16:59.710 --> 17:00.972
Ew! Creep!

17:00.980 --> 17:02.538
I have to go meet him, right?

17:02.550 --> 17:06.543
I mean, convince him
not to tell anyone about this?

17:06.550 --> 17:09.587
But you're not going alone.
(Sighs)

17:09.590 --> 17:11.581
(Phone dings, vibrates)

17:11.590 --> 17:14.559
(Scoffs)
Okay, odd.

17:18.060 --> 17:21.188
He wants to meet you
at the school.
That is so messed up!

17:21.200 --> 17:24.499
He's a known predator teacher!
What's wrong with him?

17:24.500 --> 17:26.593
It's where
we used to hook-up.

17:26.610 --> 17:28.168
I think this is
his idea of nostalgia.

17:28.170 --> 17:30.934
Or the perfect place
to exact his revenge.

17:30.940 --> 17:32.805
He's such scum, Brooke!

17:32.810 --> 17:35.199
Don't... don't spiral
on me, okay?

17:35.220 --> 17:38.610
Trust me,
he's not worth the anger.

17:38.620 --> 17:41.180
Let's just get this
over with, okay?

17:44.760 --> 17:46.716
(Suspenseful music playing)

18:00.910 --> 18:04.573
Here I am... alone...

18:04.580 --> 18:08.107
Waiting for a girl...
At a lake.

18:08.110 --> 18:12.217
And that's never gone bad
for anyone in a movie ever.

18:13.150 --> 18:16.119
Hey, Zoe!
Come out here!
Come jom me!

18:16.120 --> 18:19.214
Almost there!
Okay.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.122
(Phone camera clicks)

18:26.730 --> 18:28.789
(Phone ringing)

18:36.140 --> 18:38.074
Sorry. Just took
an extra minute.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.832
Yeah, yeah.
It's totally cool.

18:39.850 --> 18:45.015
Uh, that's okay.
I was totally fine out here
by myself. It's very chill.

18:45.020 --> 18:46.840
(Both chuckle)

18:48.020 --> 18:50.853
Thank you
for the swimsuit.
You're welcome.

18:50.860 --> 18:56.082
So, how is your
love-hate relationship
with this body of water now?

18:56.100 --> 19:01.891
I feel like a pretty big fan
of the bodies near me right now.

19:01.900 --> 19:06.291
Hold up!
Did someone get some game
while I was changing? (Chuckles)

19:06.310 --> 19:09.962
Woman:
I close my eyes

19:09.980 --> 19:11.629
in my heart

19:11.650 --> 19:14.244
I 7/ take you for a drive

19:14.250 --> 19:20.211
k/Iss me on the corner
WIth your hand In m/ne

19:20.220 --> 19:22.643
ooh

19:24.060 --> 19:26.654
Emma?
Ms. lang. Hey.

19:26.660 --> 19:30.027
I'm so sorry that I haven't
returned your phone call.
I've just been...

19:30.030 --> 19:32.396
Avoiding me. I know.

19:32.400 --> 19:37.337
No. It's just not
a good time right now.

19:37.340 --> 19:39.296
But I owe you
an apology, Emma.

19:39.310 --> 19:42.666
During the lockdown,
i was worried things
might trigger your PTSD.

19:42.680 --> 19:47.049
I only locked you
in that classroom for
your own protection, I swear.

19:47.050 --> 19:50.941
But it caused a panic attack
and I'm so sorry.

19:50.950 --> 19:52.679
I really hope
you can forgive me.

19:52.690 --> 19:54.646
Yeah, I accept
your apology, but...

19:54.650 --> 19:56.208
But what?

19:56.220 --> 19:58.154
A lot of people are trying
to help me right now,

19:58.160 --> 20:00.981
and it seems to be
turning out for the worst.

20:02.700 --> 20:05.260
We're just worried
about you, Emma.

20:05.270 --> 20:07.989
I cannot talk about this
right now, okay?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.820
I really need you
to give me some space,

20:09.840 --> 20:11.193
or I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.101
Okay, Ms. lang?
I understand.

20:14.110 --> 20:17.671
But we're... I just want you
to make sure you get
the help you need.

20:17.680 --> 20:20.240
If it's not from me,
then I can find someone else.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.241
I'll be at the school later,
grading papers,

20:22.250 --> 20:25.674
if you want to call
or stop by.

20:25.690 --> 20:27.783
Great.

20:29.990 --> 20:32.857
What was that?
That was Ms. lang
socially failing.

20:32.860 --> 20:35.727
I just cannot even deal
with her right now.
Ifeel like...

20:35.730 --> 20:37.789
Like the world's
closing in on you?

20:37.800 --> 20:39.051
(Chuckles)

20:39.070 --> 20:41.721
Yeah.
You gotta get away
from it all.

20:41.740 --> 20:45.767
I'm telling you, you're
in dire need of some fun.

20:45.770 --> 20:51.106
Which I'm actually
pretty good at,
believe it or not.

20:51.110 --> 20:53.101
All you have to do is agree.

20:55.010 --> 20:57.217
I will think about it.
Come on.

20:57.220 --> 20:59.313
Just, like, dinner tonight.

20:59.320 --> 21:02.778
My treat. Come on.
I know a really cool place.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.011
Stop it.

21:07.030 --> 21:09.351
Eli: Come on.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.998
Come on...

21:11.000 --> 21:13.252
(Suspenseful music playing)

21:20.410 --> 21:22.970
I will pick you up, 5:30?

21:24.180 --> 21:26.978
For the record,
you're a really bad salesman.

21:28.310 --> 21:30.972
Emma:
I cannot talk about this
r/ght now, okay?

21:30.980 --> 21:33.073
I really need you
to give me some space,

21:33.090 --> 21:35.809
or I don ’t know
what I ’m gonna do.

21:37.060 --> 21:39.210
Kristin:
We ’re just worried
about you, Emma.

21:39.230 --> 21:41.926
Emma:
I cannot talk about this
r/ght now, okay?

21:41.930 --> 21:43.795
I really need you
to give me some space,

21:43.800 --> 21:46.121
or I don ’t know
what I ’m gonna do.

22:09.220 --> 22:13.953
Admit it. That was_
way better than studying
particle acceleration.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.383
I... I can't argue
with that.

22:17.030 --> 22:19.396
Hey, so, um,
i was thinking...

22:19.400 --> 22:21.322
Uh-oh.
(Chuckles)

22:21.330 --> 22:24.094
My parents are actually
gonna be away tonight.

22:24.100 --> 22:28.503
Think maybe you want
to come over later? Hang out?

22:28.510 --> 22:30.239
Sounds like a plan.

22:31.210 --> 22:32.472
Cool.

22:43.860 --> 22:45.816
(Phone ringing)

22:47.930 --> 22:51.593
Focus, foster.
Woman:
come around If you dare...

22:51.600 --> 22:52.999
smooth or ribbed?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.468
(Laughing)
Look at you turn bright red!

22:55.470 --> 22:57.119
Oh, no, I'm not
buying condoms.

22:57.140 --> 23:00.132
I'm, uh...
I'm-I'm looking for, uh...

23:00.140 --> 23:01.459
Where-where's the shampoo?

23:01.470 --> 23:03.301
It's better to be safe
than sorry, baby.

23:03.310 --> 23:08.145
And, between us,
there's no difference.
What do you think?

23:08.150 --> 23:10.141
Uh, whatever's, um, best.

23:10.150 --> 23:12.971
Let's at least
narrow down the size.

23:12.990 --> 23:18.917
Now, are you a big boy?
do what you do for me
him no other

23:18.930 --> 23:20.886
Noah's on a date... ish.

23:20.890 --> 23:24.929
Whatever it is,
it seems to be going well
'cause he's not answering.

23:24.930 --> 23:26.295
Good for him.

23:26.300 --> 23:30.327
It's almost time.
What am I gonna say
to Branson?

23:30.340 --> 23:33.161
Are you seriously putting
on lipstick for that jerk?

23:33.170 --> 23:35.035
This is war paint.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.167
Look, if Branson
starts getting weird,

23:37.180 --> 23:39.171
just deny that the hotel thing
ever happened, okay?

23:39.180 --> 23:41.978
It's Branson
we're talking about.
No one's gonna believe him.

23:41.980 --> 23:46.314
Well, this town always believes
the worst about my family

23:46.320 --> 23:48.413
and this happens to be true.

23:48.420 --> 23:51.309
Seriously, Brooke, just lie.

23:51.320 --> 23:54.926
Trust me, Audrey. I know
from experience with my dad.

23:54.930 --> 23:57.182
The longer you
lie about something,

23:57.200 --> 23:59.088
the worse it gets.

24:12.210 --> 24:13.609
(Phone dings)

24:23.560 --> 24:25.915
Who's that?

24:25.930 --> 24:27.181
Noah.

24:29.060 --> 24:31.426
Okay, time to go.

24:34.270 --> 24:35.919
Are you sure
you want to do this?

24:35.940 --> 24:40.138
Yes, I have to.
Come with me or don't.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.374
Attempts to deepen
my relationship with Emma

24:45.380 --> 24:48.144
have been hindered by her
clear emotional instability.

24:48.150 --> 24:51.642
Must be diligent
about rebuilding my...
(Banging)

24:54.420 --> 24:57.958
Must be diligent
about rebuilding...
(Banging)

25:06.570 --> 25:09.164
(Phone ringing)

25:12.210 --> 25:14.235
Hello?
Distorted voice:
Hello, Kr/sbn.

25:14.240 --> 25:17.676
Yes? Who is this, please?
Just a fan
of higher education.

25:17.680 --> 25:21.673
(Scoffs) School's closed
on Sunday, super fan.
I'm hanging up now.

25:21.680 --> 25:25.969
You seem to take a real
interest In your students,
don ’t you?

25:25.990 --> 25:30.017
Who is this?
No wonder
you l/ke Seth Branson.

25:30.020 --> 25:31.988
You know Seth?
Doesn ’t everybody?

25:31.990 --> 25:35.118
People love h/m,
especially the young ladies.

25:35.130 --> 25:37.496
All of them
so hot for teacher.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.694
Real mature. Good-bye.

25:38.700 --> 25:42.261
But he’s waiting for you
right out In the hall, Kn'st/n.

25:42.270 --> 25:46.092
Don ’t worry,
he is not handsy anymore.

25:46.110 --> 25:47.532
(Hangs up)

25:51.440 --> 25:53.533
(Faint whirring)

25:53.550 --> 25:55.245
O/nk, oink, o/nk...

25:55.250 --> 25:56.706
(Whirring grows louder)

25:56.720 --> 26:00.042
o/nk, oink, oink...

26:07.260 --> 26:09.728
o/nk, oink, oink...

26:09.730 --> 26:11.357
(Whirring stops)

26:15.600 --> 26:17.192
(Door closing)

26:17.200 --> 26:20.260
(Suspenseful music playing)

26:38.720 --> 26:40.779
(Banging)

26:41.560 --> 26:43.824
(Gasps, screams)

26:46.070 --> 26:47.662
Oh, my god.

26:57.340 --> 26:58.773
(Screams)

26:58.780 --> 27:00.475
Oh, my god.

27:01.550 --> 27:03.074
Oh, my god.

27:05.350 --> 27:07.784
Seth. Seth...

27:11.120 --> 27:12.348
Run.

27:23.700 --> 27:25.258
(Screams)

27:27.810 --> 27:29.334
(Screams)

27:36.180 --> 27:37.545
(Wheels rattling)

27:37.550 --> 27:41.611
(Faint music playing
in headphones)

27:49.460 --> 27:51.121
(Turns off music)

27:51.730 --> 27:54.324
Ma'a
m?
. Ma'am!

27:55.700 --> 27:58.760
(Door opening, slamming)

28:11.650 --> 28:13.277
Brooke, Brooke!
Hold on just one second.

28:13.290 --> 28:14.712
I just want to get this
over with, okay?

28:14.720 --> 28:16.347
He's gonna be
in his old classroom.

28:18.690 --> 28:19.816
We have no idea. True?

28:19.830 --> 28:22.424
I'm about to "convince"
sleazy Branson

28:22.430 --> 28:23.829
to keep his mouth shut.

28:23.830 --> 28:24.956
I don't trust him.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.552
You came to me
because you said

28:26.570 --> 28:28.697
that I'm dark
and I understand this stuff.

28:28.700 --> 28:32.761
Well, I do!
So, let me go in first.

28:32.770 --> 28:34.658
No, I can't
let you do that.
No, no, no.

28:34.670 --> 28:37.503
Just give me a few minutes
to feel him out, okay?

28:37.510 --> 28:39.808
He's not gonna mess with me.
Besides, I'm not wearing heels,

28:39.810 --> 28:43.439
so, you know, I can run faster
if he turns out to be mental.

28:43.450 --> 28:45.509
Just a few minutes.
Just keep your phone close,

28:45.520 --> 28:49.217
and I'll let you know
when to come in, okay?

28:52.260 --> 28:53.750
Good enough. Thank you.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.455
(Sighs)

28:59.270 --> 29:02.660
I'm here! Are you here?

29:02.670 --> 29:05.230
Are you here, you dick?

29:05.610 --> 29:08.534
(Running footsteps approaching)

29:10.680 --> 29:12.898
Where's the ambulance?
What? Whoa!

29:12.910 --> 29:14.946
No, I thought
you were the paramedics.

29:14.950 --> 29:18.511
One of the teachers fell.
It's awful.

29:24.320 --> 29:27.255
Ms. lang!
She's still breathing.

29:30.460 --> 29:32.951
Oh, my god!
Brooke, you were supposed
to stay outside.

29:32.970 --> 29:34.961
Did somebody call
an ambulance?
Yeah, yeah, he did.

29:34.970 --> 29:38.497
Audrey, call someone!
He said he did!

29:38.500 --> 29:40.559
Ms. lang?

29:55.660 --> 29:56.740
(Clears throat)

29:56.760 --> 29:59.786
Oh, um...
I don't really know
what to say.

29:59.790 --> 30:01.849
And this has been
a new episode

30:01.860 --> 30:05.296
of "Zoe doesn't know
what to say."

30:05.930 --> 30:11.698
Let's see here...
We put this file
into here, save as...

30:14.840 --> 30:18.833
There you go.
Immortalized.

30:34.030 --> 30:35.622
Um...
(Clears throat)

30:35.630 --> 30:37.325
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.

30:37.330 --> 30:42.927
This is so bad.
Sorry. Do you have
any adult beverages?

30:42.940 --> 30:44.760
Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah.

30:44.770 --> 30:47.432
Uh, I think my mom has
some BlackBerry Brandy.

30:47.440 --> 30:50.329
(Chuckles)
And I instantly regret
mentioning my mom,

30:50.340 --> 30:53.503
so just...
Hold that thought.
(Both chuckle)

30:53.510 --> 30:56.809
(Chuckles)
Be right back.

31:13.800 --> 31:17.588
Audrey:
I know why
the k/l/er is after me.
He knows what I ’ve done

31:17.600 --> 31:21.934
and thatI would do anything
to keep it secret.

31:21.940 --> 31:24.579
I brought Piper to lakewood.

31:39.390 --> 31:42.951
This is the best cashew chicken
in the world, by the way.

31:42.960 --> 31:45.121
And why are we not eating
at the restaurant?

31:45.130 --> 31:49.692
This place is better.
Where are we going?

31:49.700 --> 31:51.099
Right here.

31:51.100 --> 31:53.432
This is a hole in a fence
with a lot of rusty stuff.

31:53.440 --> 31:57.774
Okay, look,
tonight is about adjusting
that gloomy world view.

31:57.780 --> 32:03.548
Okay.
This is just...
An unconventional entrance.

32:03.550 --> 32:07.441
You're never supposed
to go to the second location
with a stranger, so...

32:07.450 --> 32:12.183
I'm not a stranger, okay?
I'm just strange.

32:12.190 --> 32:14.852
Come on.
The chicken's getting cold.

32:20.870 --> 32:23.122
Man:
I was I 6 with a rocket

32:23.140 --> 32:25.495
and some sunshine
/n my pocket

32:25.500 --> 32:30.733
it was how you used
words I didn ’t know

32:30.740 --> 32:33.038
and the way
you said my name...

32:33.050 --> 32:34.608
just to get it all
out there...

32:34.610 --> 32:38.478
I've never actually had,
like, full-on sex with, like...

32:38.480 --> 32:40.971
In person,
with another person.

32:40.990 --> 32:44.084
You're in good hands.
...$tranger, stranger

32:44.090 --> 32:47.719
I ’m In the arms
of a stranger

32:47.730 --> 32:49.857
pretending its love

32:49.860 --> 32:52.454
hold/ng her close/y

32:52.470 --> 32:54.620
remembering your touch

32:54.630 --> 32:55.892
Noah! Oh, god, no!

32:55.900 --> 32:58.562
Oh, um...
Audrey, what the hell?
Get out!

32:58.570 --> 33:02.859
This is really awkward
and-and I'm sorry,
but we need to talk.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.531
Does it have to be
right this minute?

33:07.610 --> 33:09.168
I should get home.
No, no, no, no, no!

33:09.180 --> 33:13.913
You stay. She goes.
Audrey goes. Right, Audrey?

33:16.920 --> 33:21.857
Okay, this was great,
seriously, but, um...
Not that last part.

33:21.860 --> 33:23.521
So, I guess,
next time, I will find

33:23.530 --> 33:28.490
a fortress of solitude
for our study sessmns, okay?

33:37.510 --> 33:39.899
Audrey, come on.
If I had known
there would have been

33:39.910 --> 33:42.208
a real live girl in here
other than me, I wouldn't...

33:42.210 --> 33:47.113
You are not making it better.
Someone better be dead.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.915
Wait, is someone dead?

33:52.930 --> 33:54.056
Eli, what are we doing?

33:54.060 --> 33:57.848
With everything that's going on,
this is getting kind of scary.

33:57.860 --> 34:00.249
Good. It should be.

34:01.070 --> 34:02.697
This is the rush we want.

34:02.700 --> 34:06.534
The excitement of almost
getting caught, okay?

34:06.540 --> 34:08.098
Doing something
a little dangerous...

34:08.110 --> 34:11.034
It changes
your point of view.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.871
All the bs goes away.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.177
What is that
supposed to mean?

34:14.180 --> 34:16.705
It means Kieran,
Ms. lang, whatever.

34:16.720 --> 34:21.748
Just... I don't know.
Let the thrill
help you forget.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.581
It's a unit
they used as a model.

34:26.590 --> 34:30.856
I guess they just abandoned it
when construction stopped.

34:30.860 --> 34:34.819
Wait. So, they just
left everything here?

34:34.830 --> 34:37.867
That is so weird.

34:37.870 --> 34:39.633
(Phone vibrating)

34:41.670 --> 34:44.901
Um... I'm gonna tell you
something now, okay?

34:44.910 --> 34:48.141
But you have to promise
not to make fun of me.

34:48.150 --> 34:51.608
I am making no promises.
Okay. Um...

34:51.620 --> 34:53.770
So, you know
how my mom is difficult.

34:53.790 --> 34:56.918
And by "difficult,"
i mean, a total mess.

34:56.920 --> 35:00.617
I'm the only adult
between the two of us.

35:00.630 --> 35:04.350
Sometimes, when I'm, like,
feeling sick of it all, I...

35:04.360 --> 35:07.295
I make up other lives...

35:07.300 --> 35:09.825
Which sometimes involves

35:09.840 --> 35:13.890
sneaking into
other people's houses.

35:14.770 --> 35:16.658
That is called
home inva5ion.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.307
Technically, yes,
but, uh...

35:18.310 --> 35:21.939
I prefer to call it
"goldilocks-ing."

35:23.650 --> 35:25.140
Goldilocks-ing.

35:27.320 --> 35:30.744
There is no way I am not
making fun of you for that.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.251
That's fair.
Goldilocks-ing?

35:33.260 --> 35:37.788
I don't know.
(Laughs) Wow.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.758
Emma: All right,
so, uh... (Laughs)

35:40.770 --> 35:44.797
(Both talking indistinctly)

35:54.950 --> 35:59.046
It looked bad. I have
no idea if she'll live.
Do you think she was pushed?

35:59.050 --> 36:01.018
Because I could easily
run down a list of movies

36:01.020 --> 36:03.011
where someone is pushed down
the stairs during an attack.

36:03.020 --> 36:05.250
The exorcist
Dolores c/a/borne,
psycho, the sh/n/ng...

36:05.260 --> 36:08.184
Dude, I have
no idea what happened,
but that psycho texted me.

36:08.190 --> 36:13.389
He knew I was with Brooke.
He could have been posing
as Branson, luring us there.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.197
Yeah, he obviously had
something planned.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.725
Yeah, and he wanted me
to go in there alone.

36:17.740 --> 36:18.968
And you did.
That was stupid!

36:18.970 --> 36:21.234
Do you have any idea
what could've happened?
What were you thinking?

36:21.240 --> 36:24.129
He was gonna send
that image of me with
Jake's body to Brooke,

36:24.140 --> 36:25.732
and I couldn't
let that happen!

36:25.740 --> 36:28.072
But I think he was trying
to do the same thing again,

36:28.080 --> 36:30.173
like with Jake's body
at the storage unit.

36:30.180 --> 36:32.774
He wanted me there for_ whatever
was gonna happen With lang,

36:32.790 --> 36:36.146
and I think he wanted me
to look like I was a part of it.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.082
Oh, god,
or something even worse.

36:38.090 --> 36:40.752
So, Why didn't he
go through with it?

36:44.300 --> 36:46.689
The janitor.
He was interrupted
by the janitor.

36:46.700 --> 36:51.728
Before you got there,
before he could finish
whatever he was doing.

36:51.740 --> 36:56.439
If that hadn't happened,
who knows What I would
have been walking into?

37:01.910 --> 37:03.104
This isn't good, Maggie.

37:03.120 --> 37:06.078
Emma and I came back here.
We didn't find anything.

37:06.090 --> 37:08.115
Well, I did.

37:09.250 --> 37:13.755
Oh, my god. It's Emma.
You found this here?

37:13.760 --> 37:16.354
(Sighs)
Did you call Quinn?

37:16.360 --> 37:18.191
I'd rather leave him
out of this for the time being.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.350
Look, I know What you're
thinking. You're wrong.

37:20.370 --> 37:21.962
Look at where
we're standing, Maggie.

37:21.970 --> 37:24.291
Piper's dead. Someone else
is obsessed with your daughter.

37:24.300 --> 37:27.929
Who else could it be?
That's not What's
happening here!

37:27.940 --> 37:31.808
We handled that situation.
We thought we did...

37:31.810 --> 37:34.847
But, one way or another,
this is about Emma.

37:34.850 --> 37:37.842
We both know
it could be our own fault.

37:40.320 --> 37:43.448
Emma:
50, how did you
ﬁnd this place?

37:43.460 --> 37:44.757
Eli: I
Desperat/on.

37:44.760 --> 37:49.857
Lakewood is not exactly Atlanta.
I needed something to do.

37:49.860 --> 37:51.122
Mm, do you hate living here?

37:51.130 --> 37:56.124
No, it's just... it's hard
to find people to hang with
when you don't know anyone.

37:56.140 --> 37:58.995
Well, I mean,
you know Kieran.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.161
(Scoffs)
Kieran's been weird.

38:01.170 --> 38:03.161
Wait,
what do you mean, "weird"?

38:03.180 --> 38:06.274
Like... I don't know.
When I first moved here,

38:06.280 --> 38:08.407
the way he's acting, I...

38:08.410 --> 38:10.173
I thought it was a joke.
I kept waiting for him

38:14.190 --> 38:18.388
How was he diﬁ‘erent
when he was in Atlanta?

38:18.390 --> 38:21.188
I mean, "lakewood Kieran"
is a completely
different person.

38:21.190 --> 38:24.182
He moved here
and he got to start over.

38:24.200 --> 38:27.454
He's cast you
as the perfect girlfriend.

38:27.470 --> 38:29.927
(Scoffs)
Okay, well, um, yeah.

38:29.940 --> 38:32.192
That explains Why we're having
so many problems, then.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.895
Because I am
definitely not perfect.

38:33.910 --> 38:35.138
Look, there you go again.

38:35.140 --> 38:37.961
You're supposed to be
forgetting all about that.

38:37.980 --> 38:42.303
Look around. This...
This place can be anywhere.

38:42.310 --> 38:44.471
You can be anyone.

38:44.480 --> 38:48.348
Right. Well,
whoever that anyone is,

38:48.350 --> 38:50.944
still Will not be perfect.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.882
Good.

38:52.890 --> 38:55.358
Perfect is boring.

38:58.530 --> 39:02.364
I... I can't... do that.

39:02.370 --> 39:04.964
But do you want to?
I'm with Kieran.

39:04.970 --> 39:07.359
No, I know, but...
And I know...

39:07.370 --> 39:10.965
We're fighting right now
and we're having problems,

39:10.980 --> 39:13.471
but I love him
and I have to...

39:13.480 --> 39:17.348
Yeah, you need
to figure it out.
Yeah.

39:17.350 --> 39:18.977
(Alarm beeping)

39:18.980 --> 39:23.212
That's the smoke detector.
Okay, come on.

39:24.990 --> 39:27.049
VVhoa!
Oh, my god!

39:27.490 --> 39:28.923
Hey! Hey!

39:28.930 --> 39:32.093
Uh. go, go, 90-

39:36.270 --> 39:39.068
Watch out!
Oh! Oh!

39:39.970 --> 39:42.461
This way. Come on!

39:47.580 --> 39:49.468
(Coughing)

39:49.480 --> 39:51.175
Uh, we need to get
out of here, okay?

39:51.180 --> 39:54.013
We have to call
the fire department!
No, no! Look, we just broke in.

39:54.020 --> 39:57.183
They're gonna
blame us for this.
What if it was our fault?

39:57.190 --> 39:58.885
I have a history
with the police, okay?

39:58.890 --> 40:01.381
And I was just trying
to do something fun for you,

40:01.390 --> 40:03.551
and this is gonna go
really bad for me.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.425
We cannot just leave.
We can just leave, okay?

40:05.430 --> 40:08.228
We can just walk away.
Sometimes, it's better
to walk away from things.

40:08.230 --> 40:13.497
Like this, right now.
We're gonna go and we're never
gonna tell anyone. Come on!

40:17.480 --> 40:20.108
(Alarm beeping)

40:24.920 --> 40:26.239
(Gasps)

40:26.250 --> 40:29.287
(Wheezing, coughing)

40:31.490 --> 40:33.185
(Weakly)
Help.

40:37.630 --> 40:39.552
(Coughing, Wheezing)

40:39.560 --> 40:41.096
Help.

40:45.470 --> 40:46.960
Help.
