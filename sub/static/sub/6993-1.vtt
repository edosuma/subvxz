WEBVTT

01:05.432 --> 01:07.499
Well, that was your first mistake.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.334
You see, department stores are designed

01:09.336 --> 01:11.170
on the premise that people naturally travel

01:11.172 --> 01:12.604
in a clockwise direction.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.807
Go counterclockwise and
you'll spend less money.

01:14.809 --> 01:16.442
Huh, maybe.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.444
Hmm.

01:28.456 --> 01:32.691
Whoo-hoo, I got a trophy.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.560
I'm James.

01:34.562 --> 01:35.527
Oh, right, James, come in,

01:35.529 --> 01:38.797
sit down over there.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.572
James...  Harris?

01:46.574 --> 01:47.173
Yes.

01:47.875 --> 01:51.400
I want a signed contract,
not tickets to hear somebody

01:51.408 --> 01:54.413
crying Italian for three hours.
Get Steven on the phone.

01:54.515 --> 01:57.499
Steven's in, um, London, sir.
It's Christmas Eve there.

01:57.500 --> 02:01.486
Did I bloody ask
you what time it was in London?

02:09.294 --> 02:11.396
Now, what if,
instead of paying for things

02:11.398 --> 02:13.999
with money, you could
tell the cashier a story

02:14.000 --> 02:15.767
that you've never told anyone before

02:15.769 --> 02:19.738
and the crazier it was, the
more stuff you could buy?

02:19.740 --> 02:21.373
Would the story
have to be true?

02:21.375 --> 02:25.677
100% or else you get tased.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.489
No wait, if the tumor's there,

02:38.491 --> 02:39.291
we take it, right?

02:39.293 --> 02:41.326
That's why we operate.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.829
You saw her heart, the
damage was already done.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.431
If I'd have seen it on the MRI,

02:46.433 --> 02:48.867
I would have never opened her up.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.772
And you're okay with that?

02:54.199 --> 02:56.775
Whoa, ho, hold up!

03:28.474 --> 03:30.409
That there,

03:30.411 --> 03:32.477
what's the problem with you people?

03:32.479 --> 03:34.250
Don't you know what a penthouse is?

03:34.251 --> 03:38.350
I do not want a pillar obstructing my view!

03:38.352 --> 03:42.221
I'm afraid that's just not possible, sir.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.389
I mean, we could do it
but we'd have to change

03:44.391 --> 03:46.558
the five floors underneath.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.795
Well, it just so happens
that I own those five floors

03:49.797 --> 03:52.364
and all the bloody floors beneath them.

03:52.366 --> 03:55.332
I have Steven on the phone for you, sir.
Yeah, Steven?

03:55.434 --> 03:57.336
Do to unforeseen
financial constraints

03:57.438 --> 03:59.004
placed upon Pavlick Energy

03:59.006 --> 04:01.340
a reorganization's become necessary,

04:01.342 --> 04:03.575
which results in the
termination of James Harris.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.143
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:05.145 --> 04:07.412
I'm getting fired?

04:07.414 --> 04:09.581
No, laid off.

04:09.583 --> 04:13.518
But it's Christmas Eve.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.454
Hey, Turk, what's up, buddy?

04:15.456 --> 04:16.421
What?

04:16.423 --> 04:17.822
Six to eight weeks?

04:17.825 --> 04:21.692
Oh my god! What am I gonna
do for a running back?

04:31.837 --> 04:32.704
We're gonna be late!

04:32.706 --> 04:35.040
We're always late remember?

04:35.042 --> 04:36.642
All aboard who's coming aboard.

04:36.644 --> 04:37.876
Hurry guys, hurry up!

04:37.878 --> 04:40.445
Just chill, guys, it's Christmas.

04:40.447 --> 04:40.892
Come on, Dawn!

04:41.000 --> 04:44.535
Okay, look at this, good
thing we're all friends here.

04:44.537 --> 04:47.905
What about Jacob?
There's no way he'd fit in, just go.

04:47.907 --> 04:49.040
Oh, come on, Jacob.

04:49.042 --> 04:49.908
He'd better hurry.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.926
Sorry boys, got a transport.

04:55.495 --> 04:57.363
Oh well, well, it's Dr. Roberts.

04:57.365 --> 04:58.698
Nurse Ratchet.

04:58.700 --> 05:00.766
Wait a minute, isn't that the same...

05:00.768 --> 05:03.536
don't worry, she'll be out
cold for another two hours,

05:03.538 --> 05:05.438
then some poor nurse will
have to break her the news

05:05.440 --> 05:07.907
because you'll be long gone.

05:07.909 --> 05:09.809
Yeah, she's supposed
to be out in 30 minutes.

05:09.811 --> 05:13.913
I should be there in 26,
assuming the subway's on time

05:13.915 --> 05:17.516
and the crosswalk signals are
still set for commuter flow.

05:19.933 --> 05:22.555
I don't want to hear that right now.

05:22.557 --> 05:24.323
Listen, it's Christmas Eve,
we'll do it

05:24.325 --> 05:25.625
after the New Year, okay?

05:25.627 --> 05:26.993
We'll have lunch, then
we'll let the new guys

05:26.995 --> 05:29.395
introduce themselves
and I'll cover the comp.

05:29.397 --> 05:31.564
Hey, quick question,
I'm down a running back,

05:31.566 --> 05:33.933
who do you take, Moreno...

05:33.935 --> 05:35.701
Hello?

05:35.703 --> 05:37.136
Can you hear me?

05:40.607 --> 05:42.575
Um, sir, I just thought I'd remind you,

05:42.577 --> 05:43.843
it's your son's birthday.

05:43.845 --> 05:46.746
Um and it's Christmas,
should I send him a gift

05:46.748 --> 05:48.314
in your name, maybe?

05:48.316 --> 05:50.449
Reading my mind already?

06:31.359 --> 06:32.491
What was that?

06:38.432 --> 06:40.099
Shit!

06:40.101 --> 06:42.535
What the hell?

07:18.106 --> 07:18.804
That's not good.

07:18.806 --> 07:19.872
That's not good at all.

07:19.874 --> 07:20.973
Am I blind?

07:20.975 --> 07:23.134
Anyone got any ideas?

07:23.144 --> 07:27.480
I always knew I would
die in an elevator.

07:28.482 --> 07:33.552
I want you to scatter my
ashes over our apartment.

07:35.088 --> 07:39.125
On the roof or like
on the floors and stuff?

07:40.127 --> 07:42.528
Maybe just in the fish tank,

07:42.530 --> 07:43.896
like a little each day.

07:43.898 --> 07:46.134
Just like, you know, a doo-doo-doo.

07:46.135 --> 07:49.635
Did you know your fingernails
grow for like a year

07:49.637 --> 07:52.004
after you're dead?

07:52.006 --> 07:53.873
Actually, that's a myth.

07:53.875 --> 07:56.108
As the body decomposes,
the skin recedes,

07:56.110 --> 07:58.978
making it appear as if
the nails are growing,

07:58.980 --> 08:00.513
but they're not.

08:00.515 --> 08:03.416
Was that the brainiac
or the clean freak?

08:03.418 --> 08:06.419
I think it was the brainiac.

08:06.421 --> 08:08.521
The proper term for clean freak

08:08.523 --> 08:10.689
is obsessive compulsive.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.425
Used primarily as an adjective,

08:12.427 --> 08:14.894
but sometimes as a noun.

08:14.896 --> 08:16.462
So I wash my hands a lot.

08:16.464 --> 08:18.464
You should thank me.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.638
This is getting freaky!

08:44.758 --> 08:47.460
Stu, hey, dude,

08:47.462 --> 08:49.195
it's me.

08:49.197 --> 08:51.630
Yeah, what's going on out there, man?

08:51.632 --> 08:54.567
You're kidding me. The whole city?

08:54.569 --> 08:56.602
What are you telling me?

08:56.604 --> 09:00.673
Zombies, I knew it would
always end up like this.

09:00.675 --> 09:02.475
You getting your face
ripped off by bikers

09:02.477 --> 09:05.711
and me stuck in an
elevator with, hold please,

09:05.713 --> 09:07.880
what's your name?

09:07.882 --> 09:09.515
Dimples?

09:09.517 --> 09:11.517
You said Dimples to me?

09:11.519 --> 09:12.551
Interesting.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.487
Dimples and I'm stuck with her.

09:14.489 --> 09:16.956
And it would appear that
we may just be the last man

09:16.958 --> 09:20.626
and woman on earth soon.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.928
Great power does come
with great responsibility.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.530
You know what, Stu?

09:24.532 --> 09:26.532
This doesn't make
any sense, man.

09:26.534 --> 09:29.001
You know why, because I
don't get cell reception

09:29.003 --> 09:32.238
in elevators, which
means this conversation

09:32.240 --> 09:34.640
isn't happening.

09:34.642 --> 09:38.511
Which means, texting
probably doesn't work either.

09:38.513 --> 09:41.213
Hmmmm.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.549
Hi.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.089
Do you know how long it's been?

09:50.091 --> 09:52.625
Since I fell in love?

09:52.627 --> 09:56.028
Since the elevator stopped moving?

09:56.030 --> 09:58.731
10 minutes maybe?

10:01.001 --> 10:03.068
You live in 38?

10:03.070 --> 10:04.770
41?

10:04.772 --> 10:07.006
Hey, do you live in 42?

10:07.008 --> 10:08.908
Hey, you live in 43?

10:08.910 --> 10:11.277
Yes, I live in 43.

10:11.279 --> 10:13.579
I thought that snake
charmer lived in 43.

10:13.581 --> 10:16.282
No, he's in 53, next to the clogger.

10:16.284 --> 10:18.951
The clogger, that's right.

10:18.953 --> 10:21.086
So how long you lived here?

10:21.088 --> 10:22.988
Four years. You?

10:22.990 --> 10:24.557
I don't live here.

10:24.559 --> 10:26.191
I pop in, I make a
difference, I pop out.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.562
But I'm not afraid
of commitment either.

10:29.564 --> 10:29.664
You know what I heard?

10:29.664 --> 10:32.097
I heard that if you
make it to five years,

10:32.099 --> 10:34.066
this building does something
super dope for you.

10:34.068 --> 10:37.670
They turn your hot water
on for an entire day.

10:37.672 --> 10:41.306
So, I should probably swing
by and use your shower.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.676
You know?

10:48.014 --> 10:50.683
Are you all right in there?

10:52.385 --> 10:54.720
Cover your eyes!

10:54.722 --> 10:56.889
Okay.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.130
Whoa!

11:05.132 --> 11:06.298
Everyone get back.

11:06.300 --> 11:06.564
Sir, your van's conducting electricity.

11:06.566 --> 11:10.034
Don't touch anything.
Do you understand?

11:10.036 --> 11:12.570
I will be all right if
I can find my Guadalupe.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.644
Hello!

11:19.646 --> 11:23.614
Anybody! I'm stuck in the elevator!

11:23.616 --> 11:25.750
You gotta help me!

11:25.752 --> 11:29.520
I'm pregnant, I'm a pregnant woman.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.724
I'm about to have my
baby in the elevator,

11:32.726 --> 11:36.260
if you don't come
right now, I'm gonna,

11:36.262 --> 11:38.262
my water just broke!

11:38.264 --> 11:40.465
You gotta help me, please!

11:44.470 --> 11:47.405
Yeah, you want to
help me out here?

11:51.243 --> 11:54.779
Ex-employees shall not infringe

11:54.781 --> 11:56.514
upon the workspace of company,

11:56.516 --> 11:59.150
nor use its resources,
tools, or services

11:59.152 --> 12:00.551
at any time.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.186
I get it, you're pissed 'cause I laid you off.

12:02.188 --> 12:04.489
Ex-employees shall be
barred from association

12:04.491 --> 12:06.791
with current employees
on company property.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.159
Help!

12:08.161 --> 12:09.794
Whether or not such interaction...

12:09.796 --> 12:11.329
you're a lunatic!
Is at the invitation

12:11.331 --> 12:13.564
of a current employee.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.602
Listen, bro, it's Christmas Eve.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.504
I don't want to be in
here anymore than you do.

12:19.506 --> 12:22.173
Why don't you help me
get us both out of here?

12:22.175 --> 12:23.775
Get out and go where?

12:23.777 --> 12:26.077
I don't have a job, remember?

12:26.079 --> 12:28.112
You think I enjoy laying people off?

12:28.114 --> 12:29.680
Nope, firing people.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.215
You fired me.

12:31.217 --> 12:33.384
You want to think I'm evil? Go ahead!

12:33.386 --> 12:35.186
I'd like to think of you as human.

12:35.188 --> 12:38.456
I really would, but when you
can't spare fantasy football

12:38.458 --> 12:40.224
for five minutes to
square up with a guy

12:40.226 --> 12:41.793
whose life you just
turned upside down,

12:41.795 --> 12:46.197
well then you seem more like
the Spawn of Satan himself.

13:04.550 --> 13:07.652
You ever play fantasy football?

13:07.654 --> 13:11.622
No, I'm not a loser.

13:12.291 --> 13:16.294
Oh, okay, thank you.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.330
It's a power outage,
they're working on it.

13:19.332 --> 13:19.562
Five minutes at the most.

13:19.562 --> 13:24.098
Walt, if you don't stop
elbowing me, I'm gonna kill you.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.300
You hear that everybody?

13:25.302 --> 13:27.535
Give queen Dawn her precious space.

13:27.537 --> 13:29.037
Up yours, Walt.

13:29.039 --> 13:30.004
Could you just be quiet a minute?

13:30.006 --> 13:31.039
I'm trying to make this call.

13:31.041 --> 13:32.006
There's no service in here.

13:32.008 --> 13:33.408
Hey, sis?

13:33.410 --> 13:36.144
Uh, if you get this message, it's Marta.

13:36.146 --> 13:38.479
I'm stuck in an elevator

13:38.481 --> 13:40.415
with the orchestra.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.183
I think we're all gonna die.

13:42.185 --> 13:44.285
Oh, god!
Oh come on, Marta,

13:44.287 --> 13:45.653
shut the hell up!

13:45.655 --> 13:47.555
That was uncalled for, Walt.

13:47.557 --> 13:48.957
You shut up yourself.

13:48.959 --> 13:50.558
You just told Walt to shut up.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.493
I was shutting up the shutter upper.

13:52.495 --> 13:54.262
It's different.

13:54.264 --> 13:56.731
What if we miss the
entire Christmas concert?

13:56.733 --> 13:58.566
I wouldn't care if I
never played another concert

13:58.568 --> 14:00.535
in my entire life.

14:00.537 --> 14:03.237
Oh come on, you
don't mean that.

14:03.239 --> 14:04.305
Ugh.

14:04.307 --> 14:05.573
Oh, seriously?

14:05.575 --> 14:07.575
Oh.
Okay, who did that?

14:07.577 --> 14:09.277
Nice try, Walt?

14:09.279 --> 14:10.345
I'm so backed up right now

14:10.347 --> 14:12.046
I couldn't fart to save my life.

14:12.048 --> 14:14.482
Who ever did the deed, I hope you die

14:14.484 --> 14:16.684
a long and painful death. Ow!

14:16.686 --> 14:18.219
I think I just threw up.

14:18.221 --> 14:20.455
Ugh, what's that on my neck?

14:20.457 --> 14:22.590
Is that throw up on my neck?

14:22.592 --> 14:24.258
It's probably just sweat.

14:24.260 --> 14:25.460
Marta?

14:25.462 --> 14:27.362
Maybe I didn't, maybe
I didn't, it's okay.

14:27.364 --> 14:30.064
How can you not know
whether or not you threw up?

14:30.066 --> 14:31.632
It's your own sweat.

14:31.634 --> 14:32.700
Back off.

14:32.702 --> 14:34.202
Hey, relax kid.

14:34.204 --> 14:35.536
Bring it bad boy.
Hey!

14:35.538 --> 14:36.738
Walt!

14:36.740 --> 14:38.272
Come on, come on.

14:38.274 --> 14:39.574
Stop the madness!

14:44.646 --> 14:47.715
What....   was that?

14:49.618 --> 14:52.687
Who the hell has a gun in here?

14:52.689 --> 14:56.024
I don't have a gun.

14:56.026 --> 14:59.160
Me neither.

14:59.162 --> 15:02.630
I wish I had a gun.

15:02.632 --> 15:06.167
A woman of my beauty
can never be too careful.

15:10.039 --> 15:12.740
Shh.

15:31.593 --> 15:34.328
Damn it.

15:37.633 --> 15:39.801
Let me guess again, cakes?

15:39.803 --> 15:42.370
In the business of cakes?

15:43.772 --> 15:47.275
You don't work for the government.

15:47.277 --> 15:49.243
What are you an attorney?

15:49.245 --> 15:51.145
What are you, a private detective?

15:51.147 --> 15:53.481
Do I look like a private dick?

15:53.483 --> 15:56.684
I wouldn't say private.

15:58.554 --> 16:00.154
Paralegal.

16:00.156 --> 16:02.757
Ahhhh.

16:03.559 --> 16:05.660
I was wondering...
you know...

16:05.662 --> 16:07.095
I'm sorry, go ahead.

16:07.097 --> 16:09.330
No, no, no, you should go.

16:09.332 --> 16:11.332
I was just gonna say,
maybe we should try

16:11.334 --> 16:14.602
yelling or jumping up
and down or something?

16:14.604 --> 16:16.704
Really?

16:16.706 --> 16:19.107
I was gonna say that coat
is totally wrong for you.

16:19.109 --> 16:20.608
You're a fashion critic now?

16:20.610 --> 16:22.343
No, it's deeper than that.

16:22.345 --> 16:23.744
I'm a deep guy.

16:23.746 --> 16:26.647
No thanks.

16:27.349 --> 16:31.219
You ever poor crackle all
over a scoop of ice cream?

16:31.221 --> 16:32.887
I don't know.

16:32.889 --> 16:36.124
Well, you're the ice cream

16:36.126 --> 16:39.560
and that coat is your shell,

16:39.562 --> 16:41.295
that's your hiding place.

16:41.297 --> 16:42.597
Well, if you can tell I'm trying to hide,

16:42.599 --> 16:45.333
I must not be doing a very good job of it.

16:45.335 --> 16:48.569
Why would you possibly want
to hide how beautiful you are?

16:48.571 --> 16:50.538
I mean, what are you afraid of?

16:50.540 --> 16:52.707
Little ole' me?

16:52.709 --> 16:55.676
Wait, I got it.

16:55.678 --> 16:58.579
You're an only child, right?

16:58.581 --> 17:02.583
You're a sorority girl at Harvard,

17:02.585 --> 17:04.752
just like mommy was.

17:04.753 --> 17:06.387
And then you went to law
school and you thought

17:06.388 --> 17:08.656
you met Mr. Right but he
dumped you final semester

17:08.657 --> 17:10.590
when he realized he could be the next

17:10.593 --> 17:12.894
Wolf of Wall Street.

17:12.896 --> 17:14.795
You managed to graduate but

17:14.797 --> 17:16.696
you were so distraught you just couldn't

17:16.699 --> 17:18.866
pass the bar and so you
told all your friends

17:18.867 --> 17:21.502
that you're a lawyer even though, really,

17:21.503 --> 17:25.640
all you do is work for one.

17:25.642 --> 17:27.275
Here comes my favorite part.

17:27.277 --> 17:28.943
It's why I saved it for last.

17:28.945 --> 17:31.512
I can't wait.

17:31.514 --> 17:35.616
You've always wanted
to be a cheerleader.

17:35.618 --> 17:37.418
What are you doing?

17:37.420 --> 17:40.188
Well, I'd like to take a picture of you.

17:40.190 --> 17:42.323
Stop! Hey! Stop!

17:42.325 --> 17:43.758
Come one, show me
what's under that shell.

17:43.760 --> 17:43.760
Stop!

17:43.760 --> 17:46.561
Show me some emotion,
yeah, that's it.

17:46.563 --> 17:47.762
We're in the surgery wing,

17:47.764 --> 17:50.765
headed down to recovery
on the third floor.

17:52.367 --> 17:55.670
How can that be?
This is a hospital.

17:56.772 --> 17:59.407
Got it.

18:01.310 --> 18:03.644
There's a glitch with
the backup generators,

18:03.646 --> 18:05.913
should be 10 to 15 minutes.

18:05.915 --> 18:08.683
You better hope
it's fixed before sleeping

18:08.685 --> 18:10.585
beauty wakes up or one
of you's gonna have to

18:10.587 --> 18:11.752
tell her the truth.

18:11.754 --> 18:14.388
The truth is a cardiac liposarcoma.

18:14.390 --> 18:16.224
Nothing anybody could
have done about it,

18:16.226 --> 18:17.425
except god.

18:17.427 --> 18:19.794
She had that bitch covered.

18:19.796 --> 18:21.229
How's that?

18:21.231 --> 18:24.532
She asked me to pray
with her before surgery.

18:24.534 --> 18:27.702
And?

18:42.351 --> 18:44.652
Maybe we should jump up
and down to get it going.

18:44.654 --> 18:46.487
Yes!

18:46.489 --> 18:47.822
No.

18:49.258 --> 18:51.459
No.

18:51.461 --> 18:53.527
Oh.

18:54.896 --> 18:56.731
Well, I'm Molly.

18:56.733 --> 18:59.900
I have been sober for 45 minutes.

18:59.902 --> 19:04.005
I was headed to eat Chinese
with my BFF, Sherry,

19:04.007 --> 19:06.574
who will tell you about
herself in just a minute.

19:06.576 --> 19:11.045
Oh, I'm a Sagittarius and
I'm allergic to peanuts,

19:11.047 --> 19:14.548
which is rare to be a Sagittarius

19:14.550 --> 19:17.451
and allergic to peanuts.

19:18.720 --> 19:22.023
I'm Sherry, rhymes with canary.

19:22.025 --> 19:24.892
In a past life I was a cyberkinetic
force of unknown origin,

19:24.894 --> 19:28.496
but in this life, I'm a poetry major.

19:28.498 --> 19:29.930
Which means I pay the
rent by testing cosmetics,

19:29.932 --> 19:33.067
which is why my face
is kind of puffy today.

19:33.069 --> 19:35.603
Don't stare!

19:40.309 --> 19:43.811
I...  am...  Nick.

19:55.824 --> 19:57.892
I'm an art curator.

19:57.894 --> 19:59.493
I was supposed to
lead the benefit tour

19:59.495 --> 20:02.563
of the abstract exhibit
at the met tonight.

20:02.565 --> 20:06.634
Just me, in New York's leading lights.

20:06.636 --> 20:08.769
Yeah, instead I get to
spend it with four strangers

20:08.771 --> 20:13.441
who clearly wash their hands
less than three times a day.

20:13.443 --> 20:16.077
That's the national average.

20:16.079 --> 20:18.346
I know.

20:18.348 --> 20:21.382
My name is Glenn.

20:23.952 --> 20:25.653
I'm Tim Giles.

20:25.655 --> 20:28.556
And first off, cyberkinetic
forces, if they exist at all

20:28.558 --> 20:31.926
have origins as
definable as any other,

20:31.928 --> 20:34.362
unless they lay outside the
realm of time and space,

20:34.364 --> 20:35.362
which is impossible.

20:35.364 --> 20:39.667
Secondly, I don't buy that
you're going out for Chinese.

20:39.669 --> 20:43.437
Not in those shoes.

20:44.706 --> 20:47.808
Uh, well, we're headed to

20:47.810 --> 20:51.011
a salsa bar to dance with illegal people.

20:51.013 --> 20:53.914
It's our little Christmas charity.

20:53.916 --> 20:58.152
So sue us.

20:58.154 --> 21:00.721
It's not a winnable case.

21:02.792 --> 21:05.726
Are you kidding me?

21:05.728 --> 21:08.729
Why.. so.. serious? Huh?

21:08.731 --> 21:12.433
We got a party here!

21:13.835 --> 21:15.636
Looking good.

21:15.638 --> 21:17.738
Stop!

21:28.884 --> 21:31.685
Say what you're gonna say.

21:31.687 --> 21:34.822
We got a problem
getting you out of there.

21:34.824 --> 21:36.457
I know this.

21:36.459 --> 21:37.925
Que pasa?

21:37.927 --> 21:41.529
We got people stuck in
elevators all around the block.

21:41.531 --> 21:44.565
Your van severed their main power line.

21:44.567 --> 21:45.766
I screw the pooch?

21:45.768 --> 21:47.067
Yeah, you did.

21:47.069 --> 21:48.803
But your van is also
connecting the two halves

21:48.805 --> 21:50.471
of the backup line.

21:50.473 --> 21:52.606
The reason those elevators
haven't fallen to the ground

21:52.608 --> 21:54.742
is because your van is
conducting electricity to their

21:54.744 --> 21:56.577
emergency breaks.

21:56.579 --> 21:57.812
What are you gonna do?

21:57.814 --> 21:59.447
We're gonna dig down either side of you,

21:59.449 --> 22:00.948
splice a line around your van,

22:00.950 --> 22:04.051
lift you up and get you out of there.

22:04.053 --> 22:06.120
Hope it works.

22:06.122 --> 22:07.988
Me too.

22:07.990 --> 22:10.157
Can I get you anything else?

22:10.159 --> 22:12.660
Yeah.

22:12.662 --> 22:15.763
I want to see my senora.

22:15.765 --> 22:17.731
Guadalupe?

22:17.733 --> 22:20.468
My real senora.

22:21.069 --> 22:23.170
A gunshot?

22:23.172 --> 22:27.074
I don't think so, no.

22:27.076 --> 22:30.176
But if we did have a gun in here,
would that help us get out quicker?

22:30.178 --> 22:32.713
Tell them we'll shoot
a person every hour until

22:32.715 --> 22:34.148
they rescue us.

22:34.150 --> 22:37.718
No wonder you're a drummer,
you're so aggressive.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.521
10 more minutes, more or less.

22:40.523 --> 22:42.122
They're working on it as fast as they can.

22:42.124 --> 22:44.658
Let's pry the doors open.

22:44.660 --> 22:49.130
We could shoot them open.
I never want to see that gun again.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.567
Rotate?

22:53.569 --> 22:55.269
Yeah.

23:13.755 --> 23:17.224
Gonna be starting the
hallelujah chorus about now.

23:17.226 --> 23:19.527
They're asleep.

23:19.529 --> 23:21.161
Why would you say that?

23:21.163 --> 23:24.565
You're one of the world's
most accomplished violinists.

23:24.567 --> 23:27.034
I'm one of the world's
most bored violinists.

23:27.036 --> 23:28.869
I wanted to be a dancer.

23:28.871 --> 23:30.571
Then why aren't you?

23:30.573 --> 23:32.806
My mother made me give
it up for the violin.

23:32.808 --> 23:35.109
I got to admit, playing
dead guy's compositions

23:35.111 --> 23:38.679
over and over again kinda bums me out.

23:38.681 --> 23:41.615
Mozart, Bach, Handel,

23:41.617 --> 23:43.717
those guys have got more
control over my life than I do

23:43.719 --> 23:47.321
and they've been dead for over 300 years.

23:47.323 --> 23:49.089
Yeah, when I was a little
girl I used to dream of

23:49.091 --> 23:52.092
playing for the Queen of England.

23:52.094 --> 23:53.694
I taped a picture of her to my bedroom wall

23:53.696 --> 23:57.031
and practiced in front of it.

23:57.033 --> 23:59.733
Two years ago, there she was

23:59.735 --> 24:02.703
sitting in our audience.

24:04.805 --> 24:08.108
When I warm up before a concert,

24:08.110 --> 24:11.779
I do it exactly the way
my father taught me.

24:14.583 --> 24:17.051
It's like a prayer to him.

24:21.923 --> 24:25.225
I like boy bands.

24:25.227 --> 24:27.861
Please tell me that wasn't Dawn.

24:27.863 --> 24:29.296
She's got a gun,

24:29.298 --> 24:31.799
she can like whoever she wants.

24:39.674 --> 24:41.875
Come on, I said I was sorry.

24:41.877 --> 24:44.178
I didn't mean to freak you out.

24:44.180 --> 24:46.880
Now, how long has it been

24:46.882 --> 24:50.918
since we got stuck in here?

24:52.020 --> 24:55.923
Ugh, two hours?

24:55.925 --> 24:58.192
It's the only elevator in the building, right?

24:58.194 --> 25:00.194
Yeah.

25:00.196 --> 25:05.132
So they gotta know that
we are still stuck in here!

25:17.345 --> 25:21.048
I'm not an only child.

25:24.252 --> 25:26.820
What?

25:26.822 --> 25:29.356
I'm not an only child.

25:29.358 --> 25:32.760
I'm the middle of five.

25:32.762 --> 25:35.696
My dad was a janitor

25:35.698 --> 25:40.701
but I did have all the
aspirations of the rich kids.

25:42.037 --> 25:45.339
Debate club, early graduation,

25:45.341 --> 25:47.708
and the whole bit.

25:47.710 --> 25:51.979
But as soon as I got
accepted to Princeton

25:51.981 --> 25:56.817
and Yale and Harvard,
I realized I just,

25:56.819 --> 26:01.121
I really didn't want to go to any of them.

26:01.123 --> 26:04.458
It was, I don't know,

26:04.460 --> 26:07.127
I was just completely burnt out.

26:07.129 --> 26:10.330
So I stayed home and went to a couple

26:10.332 --> 26:14.001
community college classes.

26:16.771 --> 26:18.706
I'm not even a paralegal.

26:18.708 --> 26:21.408
Ahh, lies.

26:21.410 --> 26:26.113
I just make copies and coffee.

26:28.450 --> 26:32.486
Speaking of which, I'm really hungry.

26:32.488 --> 26:35.923
Do you have anything in these bags?

26:37.926 --> 26:40.861
I don't know.

26:50.805 --> 26:54.074
I'll make you a deal.

27:08.189 --> 27:11.291
Hello? Hello!

27:11.293 --> 27:13.093
Harris and son, can you hold?

27:13.095 --> 27:15.796
No, I can't.

27:17.866 --> 27:19.399
Okay, sir, what's the problem?

27:19.401 --> 27:20.801
What do you think the problem is?

27:20.803 --> 27:22.903
I'm stuck in this damned elevator!

27:22.905 --> 27:24.304
Yeah, I see that.

27:24.306 --> 27:27.307
Uh, we're dealing with
a situation down here.

27:27.309 --> 27:29.777
I'm gonna check it out
as soon as possible.

27:29.779 --> 27:31.011
Really sorry about that.

27:31.013 --> 27:33.013
You've just spoken
four complete sentences

27:33.015 --> 27:36.116
without providing one drop
of pertinent information.

27:36.118 --> 27:38.552
I already realize my
elevator has a situation

27:38.554 --> 27:41.388
and you being sorry in and of itself

27:41.390 --> 27:43.190
is not pertinent.

27:43.192 --> 27:45.893
Your checking out the
problem is not pertinent.

27:45.895 --> 27:48.061
I doubt that you are even pertinent!

27:48.063 --> 27:51.999
But whoever you are, you
better get this elevator moving

27:52.001 --> 27:54.835
in one minute or I will find you,

27:54.837 --> 27:57.805
fire you, and then make
sure that you are fired

27:57.807 --> 28:00.307
from your next three jobs after that.

28:00.309 --> 28:02.309
Is that pertinent enough for you?

28:04.046 --> 28:07.247
Hello? Hello?

28:23.264 --> 28:26.834
Over two hours.

28:27.836 --> 28:29.469
What's going on?

28:29.471 --> 28:34.007
It can't be that hard
to reset the system.

28:44.519 --> 28:48.455
Don't let him get to you, doc.

28:48.457 --> 28:53.527
The idea of a higher power
helps someone, then great.

28:53.928 --> 28:56.597
Personally, I don't buy it.

28:56.599 --> 28:58.232
You don't buy it or you don't buy

28:58.234 --> 29:02.035
that anyone should buy it?

29:03.137 --> 29:05.906
I don't like to see
good people get hurt

29:05.908 --> 29:09.509
putting faith in things that aren't real.

29:09.511 --> 29:13.480
Did you get hurt, doc?

29:18.319 --> 29:21.955
It's just not real.

29:22.924 --> 29:24.893
Are heart transplants real?

29:24.895 --> 29:24.900
Of course they are.

29:25.900 --> 29:31.665
Now, but they were only
imaginary a few decades ago.

29:31.667 --> 29:35.102
So if we wait long enough
then anything can be...

29:38.240 --> 29:41.041
Oww!

29:44.179 --> 29:47.581
Hello?

29:47.583 --> 29:49.650
Yeah?

29:49.652 --> 29:52.686
Okay.

29:56.524 --> 30:01.128
I think we might have
killed the backup system.

30:02.397 --> 30:03.563
If ever there was an argument

30:03.565 --> 30:06.667
against intelligent design...

30:21.582 --> 30:23.717
Ping.

30:26.355 --> 30:29.690
Huh, "abandon hope, all ye who enter here."

30:29.692 --> 30:33.527
Okay, I'm gonna pretend
that I didn't see that.

30:56.151 --> 30:57.718
Could you please stop doing that?

30:57.720 --> 31:00.687
Hey, we're stuck between
the 15th and 16th floors.

31:00.688 --> 31:01.787
We're aware of that.

31:01.789 --> 31:03.657
So the logical solution
is to lower us half a floor

31:03.659 --> 31:05.525
by accessing the reserve cable.

31:05.527 --> 31:07.561
There's no such thing as a reserve cable,

31:07.563 --> 31:08.695
but nice try.

31:08.697 --> 31:10.097
Don't patronize me,

31:10.099 --> 31:11.565
we all have the same problem,

31:11.567 --> 31:14.568
one problem, increasing the
ratio of problem solvers

31:14.570 --> 31:17.004
to said problem inevitably
improves our chances

31:17.006 --> 31:19.039
of solving that problem is less time.

31:19.041 --> 31:20.574
Sir, we are working very hard...

31:20.576 --> 31:23.310
possibility number one,
a secondary source of power

31:23.312 --> 31:25.746
as evidenced by the
backup lights is available

31:25.748 --> 31:28.015
and while probably insufficient
to simultaneously power

31:28.017 --> 31:30.083
every elevator in the
building, might be fed

31:30.085 --> 31:31.385
exclusively to one.

31:36.257 --> 31:39.593
Seven and a half
billion people in the world

31:39.595 --> 31:42.129
and you manage to piss
off the one man who could

31:42.131 --> 31:44.264
possibly help us.

31:44.266 --> 31:48.235
There are only 7.163
billion people in the world.

31:50.471 --> 31:53.473
Point taken.

31:54.375 --> 31:57.744
It was dark, it was misty,

31:57.746 --> 32:00.747
it was no night to
be running out of gas

32:00.749 --> 32:03.650
on a lonely country road.

32:03.652 --> 32:06.686
The husband locked his wife in the car

32:06.688 --> 32:09.289
while he went for help.

32:09.291 --> 32:12.826
But when he came back, she was dead

32:12.828 --> 32:14.694
and there was someone
he'd never seen before

32:14.696 --> 32:17.497
in the car with her.

32:17.499 --> 32:19.566
But the doors had not been opened,

32:19.568 --> 32:23.637
the windows had not been rolled down.

32:23.639 --> 32:27.441
The car... it was a baby.

32:30.511 --> 32:34.181
Why can't you take a
picture of an Indian woman

32:34.183 --> 32:36.550
with hair curlers?

32:36.552 --> 32:38.251
You need a camera to take a picture,

32:38.253 --> 32:40.787
not hair curlers.

32:47.795 --> 32:51.298
Take an empty wine bottle, drop a coin it

32:51.300 --> 32:54.601
and put a cork in the top of the bottle.

32:54.603 --> 32:57.337
How can you get the coin
out without removing

32:57.339 --> 33:00.407
the cork?

33:00.409 --> 33:02.142
There's no such thing
as a question without

33:02.144 --> 33:04.578
an answer.

33:04.580 --> 33:07.180
You might not know it
now, but it's out there,

33:07.182 --> 33:09.116
waiting to be found.

33:09.118 --> 33:12.385
Wanting to be found.

33:12.387 --> 33:15.322
It's almost always simple.

33:15.324 --> 33:18.625
So simple, it's almost silly.

33:18.627 --> 33:22.262
And when you find it,

33:22.264 --> 33:27.167
well, there's no feeling
like it in the world.

33:32.719 --> 33:35.922
My wife's gonna kill me.

33:35.924 --> 33:38.191
My dad's gonna kill
me when he finds out

33:38.193 --> 33:40.059
I was fired.

33:40.061 --> 33:42.061
Laid off.

33:42.063 --> 33:45.031
He's a big time developer.

33:45.033 --> 33:48.768
All he cares about is work and money.

33:48.770 --> 33:52.071
He's building a skyscraper
with a five floor penthouse,

33:52.073 --> 33:53.739
just for him.

33:53.741 --> 33:56.242
You know, I've had to
lay off 238 people since I

33:56.244 --> 33:58.044
started this job?

33:58.046 --> 34:01.481
I have list at home of
everybody I've ever laid off.

34:01.483 --> 34:04.016
I don't know why I keep it.

34:04.018 --> 34:06.953
Probably helps you to
pretend you really care.

34:06.955 --> 34:08.688
What are you a Saint?

34:08.690 --> 34:11.023
It's like watching tornado
coverage on the news,

34:11.025 --> 34:12.925
you know you should feel
bad but then you just

34:12.927 --> 34:15.594
change the channel and
thank god it wasn't you.

34:15.597 --> 34:17.830
You know what the execs
call you employees?

34:17.831 --> 34:19.264
Care Bears.

34:19.266 --> 34:21.501
Know what they call you?

34:21.503 --> 34:23.668
Snow White because you're so bored

34:23.670 --> 34:26.973
and disengaged that you
might as well be dead.

34:26.975 --> 34:28.107
Snow White?

34:28.109 --> 34:30.710
Yeah, Dave called you sasquatch,

34:30.712 --> 34:33.813
but he never made any sense.

34:33.815 --> 34:36.882
Dave, you know Dave slept

34:36.885 --> 34:39.886
on my couch one night?

34:39.888 --> 34:44.090
Yeah, company Christmas
party two years ago.

34:44.092 --> 34:47.994
Dave, designated driver Dave,

34:47.996 --> 34:51.764
gets so sloshed, calls a cab, climbs inside,

34:51.766 --> 34:53.866
and can't remember where he lives.

34:53.868 --> 34:55.801
The hotel gives him my
address since I'm the guy

34:55.803 --> 34:57.069
who paid for the party,

34:57.071 --> 35:00.640
he shows up at my house,
he's got no idea he's

35:00.642 --> 35:01.841
at the wrong place.

35:01.843 --> 35:04.010
He waltzes in on my wife and me,

35:04.012 --> 35:06.112
so we take him out and
put him on the couch.

35:06.114 --> 35:09.649
Next morning we get up,
he's gone without a trace.

35:09.651 --> 35:11.617
Blanket's folded up, the whole bit,

35:11.619 --> 35:13.219
like he was never there.

35:13.221 --> 35:15.555
And he never said a word
about it and neither did I,

35:15.557 --> 35:18.558
but every Christmas, there's
a plate of sugar cookies

35:18.560 --> 35:20.660
arrives on our doorstep.

35:20.662 --> 35:22.862
Little reindeer sugar cookies

35:22.864 --> 35:25.031
and I know it's
Dave bringing them.

35:25.033 --> 35:27.166
That's not Dave.

35:27.168 --> 35:29.869
It's accounting.

35:29.871 --> 35:33.172
They put eyedrops in them,

35:33.874 --> 35:36.809
diarrhea.

35:37.811 --> 35:40.613
That explains a lot.

35:42.082 --> 35:46.752
Oh, I know, it's just the
worst thing ever, isn't it?

35:48.889 --> 35:51.591
Perfect.
Okay.

35:52.326 --> 35:55.061
All right.

36:01.035 --> 36:03.235
Wow!

36:13.213 --> 36:16.349
Let's do it.

36:27.027 --> 36:27.927
Sir?

36:27.929 --> 36:31.397
Hello? Yes, I'm in here!

36:31.399 --> 36:32.865
We're trying to get you down.

36:32.867 --> 36:34.166
There's a power outage a block away

36:34.168 --> 36:35.167
and it looks like it might be awhile.

36:35.169 --> 36:37.203
Just open the damn door!

36:37.205 --> 36:38.203
You're between floors, sir,

36:38.205 --> 36:40.072
even if we could... is there anything

36:40.074 --> 36:42.241
you know how to do?

36:42.243 --> 36:43.241
Sir, I'm trying my...

36:43.243 --> 36:46.278
you're fired!
That's what you are!

36:47.948 --> 36:50.316
Hello?

36:50.318 --> 36:53.185
Hello? Come back here!

36:57.124 --> 37:00.359
Hello? Hello?

37:01.895 --> 37:04.730
Oh, shit!

37:05.866 --> 37:08.167
Get me...

37:08.169 --> 37:11.570
out of here!
Ahhhhh!

37:31.692 --> 37:34.393
Like this.

37:36.363 --> 37:39.398
Well, it's
not as big as my face.

37:39.400 --> 37:41.767
You gotta push harder.

37:45.038 --> 37:48.107
Oww! You little runt.

37:50.143 --> 37:52.878
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:52.880 --> 37:56.082
I almost started to pee.

37:57.250 --> 37:59.085
Think of something else.

37:59.087 --> 38:00.319
Think about cars.

38:00.321 --> 38:03.022
What kind of car do
you think she drives?

38:03.024 --> 38:05.124
What's she do, chief?

38:05.126 --> 38:07.393
She's a harpist in the orchestra.

38:07.395 --> 38:09.395
So she's gotta drive something big

38:09.397 --> 38:12.098
enough to haul the harp around.

38:12.100 --> 38:14.900
She's what? 35?

38:14.902 --> 38:16.135
32.

38:16.137 --> 38:17.803
A young, poor musician,

38:17.805 --> 38:19.105
it's gotta be used.

38:19.107 --> 38:23.209
A 2001 Volvo wagon.

38:24.044 --> 38:26.512
No, her husband's a computer programmer.

38:26.514 --> 38:31.517
So, we do have a little money. Hmm.

38:32.486 --> 38:34.186
A Land Rover?

38:34.188 --> 38:35.955
Could be.

38:35.957 --> 38:37.156
10 bucks says it's red.

38:37.158 --> 38:38.257
Why?

38:38.259 --> 38:40.259
Musicians love red.

38:40.261 --> 38:44.196
Passionate artist, dressed
in black all the time.

38:44.198 --> 38:46.866
Whenever they can, they choose red.

38:46.868 --> 38:48.000
Says who?

38:48.002 --> 38:50.469
Says...

38:50.471 --> 38:52.071
studies.

38:52.073 --> 38:53.973
I bet her car's black 'cause she's

38:53.975 --> 38:55.474
conditioned to like black.

38:55.476 --> 38:57.276
I bet it's brown.

38:57.278 --> 38:59.078
Look at her hair color.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.080
She's kept it natural.

39:01.082 --> 39:04.083
How 'bout you, Dr. Moneybags?

39:04.085 --> 39:09.155
Mmm, I'll say white, not off white,

39:09.157 --> 39:10.122
pure white.

39:10.124 --> 39:12.057
You know, like heaven.

39:12.059 --> 39:14.126
Here we go.

39:14.128 --> 39:18.297
Look, let's be honest,
god, white beard, angels.

39:18.299 --> 39:21.233
Isn't that the most ridiculous
thing you've ever heard?

39:21.235 --> 39:23.002
Is there anything about our existence

39:23.004 --> 39:24.537
that isn't ridiculous?

39:24.539 --> 39:26.372
Sure there is.

39:26.374 --> 39:29.575
Let's assume the universe existed

39:29.577 --> 39:33.179
only as random chaos

39:33.181 --> 39:36.081
and 14 billion years ago

39:36.083 --> 39:38.017
there was a big bang

39:38.019 --> 39:42.021
and out of it came planets
and stars and vegetables

39:42.023 --> 39:45.324
and cavemen and the
five of us all sitting

39:45.326 --> 39:46.859
right here in this elevator?

39:46.861 --> 39:48.594
Is that possible?

39:48.596 --> 39:50.095
You bet it is.

39:50.097 --> 39:53.933
And is it also crazy?

39:53.935 --> 39:59.004
Yeah, because I don't care
how any of us got here,

39:59.006 --> 40:04.076
it's mind-blowing,
incredible and grand.

40:05.412 --> 40:10.149
All right, a beautiful,
young wife whose heart is being

40:10.151 --> 40:15.054
strangled now, explain that
and a loving god to me,

40:15.056 --> 40:19.024
on this fine Christmas Eve?

40:19.359 --> 40:22.461
I can't.

40:23.263 --> 40:25.631
I'll tell you what I can explain.

40:25.633 --> 40:29.468
One summer evening when I was 10,

40:29.470 --> 40:34.240
I was playing outside because
my parents were fighting.

40:34.242 --> 40:37.910
The sun was going down
and I turned around

40:37.912 --> 40:42.982
to look at my house
and I had this feeling

40:43.183 --> 40:48.254
as clear as anything
that god knows who I am.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.590
It wasn't like, here's the whole story,

40:51.592 --> 40:56.562
or now it's us against
them, it was just

40:59.499 --> 41:03.068
know this,

41:03.070 --> 41:06.171
know this one thing.

41:06.173 --> 41:10.242
And, uh, I could never deny what I felt

41:10.244 --> 41:12.511
at that moment

41:12.513 --> 41:16.215
and hanging on to it
gets me passed the things

41:16.217 --> 41:19.518
that I don't understand.

41:19.520 --> 41:23.322
I don't know everything, but it doesn't mean

41:23.324 --> 41:26.659
I don't know anything.

41:31.197 --> 41:36.235
Yeah, yeah, we're almost down to the mains.

41:37.504 --> 41:40.339
That's great, not too deep.

41:41.575 --> 41:45.611
Yeah, well, I'll get right back to you.

41:45.613 --> 41:48.547
Mr. Cooper?

41:49.082 --> 41:50.416
Mrs. Lopez?

41:56.222 --> 41:56.322
If we're halfway between floors,

41:56.322 --> 41:59.389
the top of our elevator's
got to be no more

41:59.391 --> 42:01.592
than 10 feet from the next floor.

42:01.594 --> 42:04.394
Why not just break the
bottle to get the coin out?

42:04.396 --> 42:05.596
You can't break the bottle.

42:05.598 --> 42:07.197
Can you melt it?

42:07.199 --> 42:09.233
No, because you can't
alter the condition

42:09.235 --> 42:10.567
of the bottle in any way.

42:10.569 --> 42:14.371
Hey, could you give me a boost, big guy?

42:16.407 --> 42:19.409
Okay.

42:19.411 --> 42:22.312
Ah, let's play charades.

42:22.314 --> 42:22.913
Yes!

42:22.915 --> 42:24.915
I'll go first.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.750
It's movie.
Yes.

42:26.752 --> 42:28.385
Two words.

42:28.387 --> 42:30.354
There's no light
coming from the other floors.

42:30.356 --> 42:33.390
No way to tell how
far the next one is.

42:33.392 --> 42:36.426
A horse, a deer?

42:37.695 --> 42:40.364
Deer Hunter?

42:42.668 --> 42:44.568
It's a dog.

42:44.570 --> 42:46.904
If we could get up there,

42:46.906 --> 42:49.406
the doors probably wouldn't
open with the power out.

42:50.643 --> 42:52.309
Benji?

42:52.311 --> 42:54.378
Hounds Of The Damned?

42:54.380 --> 42:56.380
Old Yeller.

42:56.382 --> 42:58.315
Yeah.

42:58.317 --> 42:59.816
How did he get that?

42:59.818 --> 43:03.420
Saddest movie ever,
scarred me for life,

43:03.422 --> 43:04.588
I loved it.

43:04.590 --> 43:06.890
Saddest thing you can think of, go!

43:06.892 --> 43:09.426
A puppy in a full body cast

43:09.428 --> 43:12.429
and he's crying and in the reflection

43:12.431 --> 43:14.831
of one of the tears,
there's a unicorn and he's

43:14.833 --> 43:17.334
starving to death.

43:17.336 --> 43:18.936
Hmm, it's hard to top that.

43:18.938 --> 43:20.637
Yes, it is.

43:20.639 --> 43:23.574
A boy who eats his best friend.

43:23.576 --> 43:26.210
Eaww.

43:26.212 --> 43:29.313
Um, a bunny who falls in a well

43:29.315 --> 43:32.849
and no one can save him because...

43:32.851 --> 43:35.886
everyone's been eaten.

43:37.355 --> 43:41.959
Your turn, Einstein, saddest thing ever.

43:43.695 --> 43:46.763
Well, there was a scientist who lived

43:46.765 --> 43:49.833
300 years ago who wanted to figure out

43:49.835 --> 43:52.469
how much the earth weighed.

43:52.471 --> 43:54.438
And he theorized a
series of measurements

43:54.440 --> 43:56.673
that could be taken
using pendulums, weights,

43:56.675 --> 43:58.308
and counterweights.

43:58.310 --> 44:02.379
He spent years building
his ingenious contraption

44:02.381 --> 44:04.314
and then he died.

44:04.316 --> 44:06.416
He knew exactly how to get the answer,

44:06.418 --> 44:10.854
but he never got to know it.

44:17.295 --> 44:20.397
Everything that has ever occurred,

44:20.399 --> 44:22.366
everything that ever will occur

44:22.368 --> 44:24.701
is subject to laws that are knowable

44:24.703 --> 44:26.470
and with enough of that knowledge,

44:26.472 --> 44:29.473
you could literally
understand everything.

44:29.475 --> 44:32.643
And to live in recognition of that gulf,

44:32.645 --> 44:35.045
between what is knowable,
which is everything,

44:35.047 --> 44:38.782
and what we actually know,
which is almost nothing,

44:38.784 --> 44:42.352
well that's more than sad.

44:42.354 --> 44:45.455
It's the ultimate human tragedy.

44:53.464 --> 44:56.033
You know the problem
with this company?

44:56.035 --> 44:58.635
Global energy's a big challenge, right?

44:58.637 --> 45:01.405
So we think we gotta be a big company,

45:01.407 --> 45:05.075
so we end up big and
slow and old-fashioned.

45:05.077 --> 45:06.643
No way to stay ahead of
the curve when you're built

45:06.645 --> 45:08.478
like an aircraft carrier.

45:08.480 --> 45:11.581
Yeah, it's the worst
place to be though,

45:11.583 --> 45:12.825
ahead of the curve.

45:12.825 --> 45:12.837
Why?

45:12.837 --> 45:17.807
Everyone is always
focusing on energy sources,

45:17.809 --> 45:19.909
I mean you can get
energy from anything;

45:19.911 --> 45:22.045
Water, corn, dead dinosaurs,

45:22.047 --> 45:25.281
but it's the delivery
of energy that poses

45:25.283 --> 45:27.150
the greatest opportunity.

45:27.152 --> 45:28.885
And it's simple.

45:28.887 --> 45:30.086
You mean microgrids?

45:30.088 --> 45:31.821
No, no, no.

45:31.823 --> 45:32.922
The fiberoptic?

45:32.924 --> 45:34.891
Nope.

45:34.893 --> 45:38.161
What?

45:45.869 --> 45:47.737
What is this? Your magnum opus?

45:47.739 --> 45:50.039
Check it out.

45:55.479 --> 45:57.313
This is your idea?

45:57.315 --> 45:58.815
I said it was simple.

45:58.817 --> 46:01.184
Why haven't you
shared this with anyone?

46:01.186 --> 46:03.786
I'm in tech support,
or rather was,

46:03.788 --> 46:05.354
plus, it's not fully thought out yet.

46:05.356 --> 46:07.256
I mean, I can deliver
energy straight to your

46:07.258 --> 46:09.859
front porch, but if you've
got a house with stoneage

46:09.861 --> 46:12.228
circuitry, well, that's where

46:12.230 --> 46:14.263
the magic ends.

46:14.265 --> 46:17.266
Well, who says you need
to go inside the house?

46:17.268 --> 46:19.335
Make them go out and get it.

46:19.337 --> 46:22.271
Not the people, the gadgets.

46:23.807 --> 46:25.208
They want a second extension,

46:25.210 --> 46:27.443
one way or another, somebody's
gonna hung out to dry

46:27.445 --> 46:28.443
and it ain't gonna be me.

46:28.445 --> 46:31.748
Call the fixer, get the
names of all the other

46:31.750 --> 46:35.351
competitors, take out
separate lawsuits,

46:35.353 --> 46:37.887
get Hillman back
from his honeymoon,

46:37.889 --> 46:39.489
he can help.

46:39.491 --> 46:43.326
And find the name of
Kelso's favorite restaurant,

46:43.328 --> 46:46.429
buy it, we can't
wine and dine him,

46:46.431 --> 46:50.866
let's make damn sure
no other bugger can. Ahhh!

46:53.037 --> 46:54.771
Show me what's
underneath that shell.

46:54.773 --> 46:56.105
Think about the clogger.

46:56.107 --> 46:57.073
I hate the clogger.

46:57.075 --> 46:58.341
How much do you hate him?

46:59.410 --> 47:00.443
Clogging in the morning,

47:00.445 --> 47:01.811
clogging in the evening,

47:01.813 --> 47:03.513
clogging 'til you want to die.

47:03.515 --> 47:05.982
He clogs for the girl in 43.

47:05.984 --> 47:08.851
But you know what,
she's not a lover,

47:08.853 --> 47:10.888
she's a fighter.

47:11.890 --> 47:13.890
We're not making copies today.

47:13.892 --> 47:16.526
She's got a jaw of steel,
ladies and gentlemen.

47:16.528 --> 47:19.395
Show me what's
underneath that shell.

47:19.397 --> 47:20.830
A heart of glass.

47:20.832 --> 47:21.998
What does that mean?

47:22.000 --> 47:23.833
When that heart gets broken,

47:23.835 --> 47:25.434
ain't nobody gonna come in...

47:25.436 --> 47:27.804
okay, you know what, I'm done.

47:27.806 --> 47:31.541
I just, I want my
stupid candy bar, okay?

47:37.081 --> 47:39.015
All right.

47:39.950 --> 47:42.885
You earned it.

47:42.887 --> 47:46.189
I kind of hate you.

47:55.033 --> 47:58.501
Hola, Jorge.

48:11.882 --> 48:13.015
Hey, hey!

48:13.017 --> 48:15.852
No, no.

48:50.287 --> 48:51.988
And I want him scared stiff,

48:51.990 --> 48:53.890
I want him scared into action.

48:53.892 --> 48:56.893
These people, they aren't tough,

48:56.895 --> 48:59.061
they're weak people
trying to act tough.

48:59.063 --> 49:00.296
They're wasting my time.

49:10.641 --> 49:14.543
Please? Won't somebody help me?

49:14.545 --> 49:17.680
I am stuck in here!

49:20.651 --> 49:23.252
Help me!

49:37.634 --> 49:40.202
God help me.

49:43.041 --> 49:45.174
I'll dose her down to make it last,

49:45.176 --> 49:47.710
but if her vitals drop, you're gonna have

49:47.712 --> 49:51.614
the mother of all
lawsuits on your hands.

49:51.616 --> 49:53.182
I'm gonna have the
mother of all divorces

49:53.184 --> 49:56.118
on my hands if I don't
get out of here soon.

49:56.120 --> 49:58.587
I promised my wife I'd take
her to the Met tonight,

49:58.589 --> 50:03.059
some Christmas Eve art thing.

50:04.595 --> 50:07.296
Just go in the corner.

50:07.298 --> 50:11.000
Not in here, you don't.

50:11.535 --> 50:14.637
Let me show you a trick.

50:16.406 --> 50:20.076
Ah, I don't think
that'll handle the volume.

50:20.078 --> 50:22.144
I did a rotation at
in eastern medicine.

50:22.146 --> 50:23.746
I'm gonna show you how to block out

50:23.748 --> 50:26.248
pain with your mind.

50:26.250 --> 50:28.651
Stick this into my neck.

50:50.607 --> 50:53.042
The mind controls the body.

50:53.044 --> 50:55.378
The body serves the mind.

50:55.380 --> 50:58.047
Through the mind, into the body.

50:58.049 --> 51:00.449
So...
shhh.

51:05.223 --> 51:08.524
My body is hereby denied
permission to feel pain.

51:08.526 --> 51:11.060
My mind has not authorized it.

51:11.062 --> 51:14.697
My mind has not deemed it so.

51:17.367 --> 51:18.667
Right here.

51:18.669 --> 51:21.070
All at once.

51:45.195 --> 51:48.130
Ha.

51:48.665 --> 51:51.700
Ha!

51:56.808 --> 51:58.774
Take it out!

51:58.776 --> 52:00.810
Take it out!

52:00.812 --> 52:02.778
I can't!

52:02.780 --> 52:04.246
Come here.

52:04.248 --> 52:05.815
Hold still, hold still.

52:14.357 --> 52:15.691
You said you
wouldn't feel it.

52:15.693 --> 52:17.126
Yeah.

52:18.229 --> 52:19.862
Karen? Can you hear me?

52:21.132 --> 52:22.731
Try not to move.

52:22.733 --> 52:24.800
Heart rate is climbing.

52:24.802 --> 52:28.537
Probably from somebody screaming.

52:28.539 --> 52:31.273
Karen, I want you to relax.

52:31.275 --> 52:34.543
Can you hear me?

52:38.548 --> 52:42.251
Where's my husband?

53:04.674 --> 53:07.376
After several days,
officials changed the mission

53:07.378 --> 53:10.379
from one of rescue to recovery.

53:10.381 --> 53:12.248
But friends and family held out hope,

53:12.250 --> 53:14.750
staging a candlelight vigil
in the building's lobby

53:14.752 --> 53:18.554
mere feet from where the
group were last seen.

53:22.692 --> 53:24.727
And it's a regular sized coin?

53:24.729 --> 53:27.696
Regular sized coin,
regular sized bottle,

53:27.698 --> 53:30.900
regular sized cork.

53:30.902 --> 53:34.537
Not a time travel thing?

53:43.780 --> 53:46.215
So, uh,

53:46.217 --> 53:50.186
what do they mean?

53:50.720 --> 53:54.857
Oh, uh, lots of things.

53:58.762 --> 54:02.464
Uh, this one's for my grandpa.

54:04.734 --> 54:07.803
This one's my mom.

54:08.672 --> 54:12.241
This is my goldfish, Mr. Sundae,

54:12.243 --> 54:15.878
he still hasn't figured
out what he wants to say.

54:17.414 --> 54:21.984
Um, what about,
uh, um, this one?

54:21.986 --> 54:23.652
That one?

54:23.654 --> 54:28.257
That one's complicated.

54:31.995 --> 54:34.496
Oh, it's beautiful.

54:34.498 --> 54:36.498
Who's it for?

54:36.500 --> 54:38.867
A friend.

54:38.869 --> 54:42.705
A, uh, a girlfriend?

54:42.707 --> 54:45.774
Not anymore.

55:04.694 --> 55:06.428
Is that water?

55:06.430 --> 55:07.896
You have water?

55:07.898 --> 55:10.699
Yes.

55:10.701 --> 55:12.901
I think we should
give it to Jacob.

55:12.903 --> 55:14.403
I'm all right for now.

55:14.405 --> 55:15.738
I think we should save it.

55:15.740 --> 55:17.706
In case we're
trapped in a smaller,

55:17.708 --> 55:19.775
hotter, elevator some day?

55:19.777 --> 55:21.977
Maybe Jacob's right,
maybe we should save it.

55:21.979 --> 55:23.779
Crimeny!

55:23.781 --> 55:25.681
I'll give you $20 for it.

55:25.683 --> 55:29.585
I'll give you $100 for it.

55:29.587 --> 55:33.355
Since when do you have 100 bucks?

55:36.726 --> 55:39.561
We'll save it for later.

55:39.563 --> 55:41.463
Yeah.

55:46.770 --> 55:51.307
Christmas Eve, solo performance,

55:51.309 --> 55:54.476
what do you play?

55:54.478 --> 55:56.612
I'll Be Home For Christmas.

55:58.316 --> 56:01.350
Bing Crosby, better than Beethoven.

56:03.321 --> 56:04.753
Got similar chord progressions.

56:04.755 --> 56:08.023
Not sure what we could
bring to the lyrics.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
♪I'm dreaming tonight♪

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
♪Of a place, I love♪

56:28.800 --> 56:38.000

♪If only in my dreams♪

58:36.339 --> 58:37.073
Ah....  yeah.

58:38.808 --> 58:41.109
It's the same delivery
system you're talking about

58:41.111 --> 58:43.645
but we apply it to both sides,

58:43.647 --> 58:45.581
doubling its efficiency.

58:45.583 --> 58:46.581
What about rural areas?

58:46.583 --> 58:48.717
You know, places that
don't draw that much power?

58:48.719 --> 58:53.155
Maybe we could sell the
midwest back to the French.

58:54.190 --> 58:56.558
Or, we could offset the difference

58:56.560 --> 58:58.660
with a bigger push from the primary?

58:58.662 --> 59:00.028
I don't know. No, no, no.

59:00.030 --> 59:02.731
We're making it too complicated.

59:02.733 --> 59:06.735
The beauty of it was
its simplicity. Right?

59:06.737 --> 59:09.838
How do we turn a rural
area's remoteness,

59:09.840 --> 59:13.141
into a benefit?

59:16.880 --> 59:20.015
Hello? Is anybody there?

59:20.017 --> 59:22.851
I need to reach my son.

59:22.853 --> 59:26.955
I have to tell him that...

59:29.592 --> 59:31.760
I didn't expect
him to understand.

59:31.762 --> 59:35.664
I certainly don't
expect him to forgive me

59:37.133 --> 59:41.003
but he ought to know

59:41.005 --> 59:45.307
that I know that I screwed up.

59:45.309 --> 59:49.611
I've got a lot of stuff.

59:49.613 --> 59:53.248
That's not what we had.

59:53.250 --> 59:55.217
You, your mum, and me

59:55.219 --> 59:59.855
had a one bedroom
flat in north London.

59:59.857 --> 01:00:03.959
Archway.

01:00:05.161 --> 01:00:08.797
You probably don't remember it

01:00:08.799 --> 01:00:12.668
but we were rich.

01:00:15.872 --> 01:00:19.675
All this other stuff,

01:00:19.677 --> 01:00:22.878
it's nothing!

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.948
They dress you up,

01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:29.117
they tell you you can
buy everything you want,

01:00:29.119 --> 01:00:32.988
act like you own the world,

01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:36.224
but that isn't it.

01:00:38.194 --> 01:00:43.265
We were rich, James, Jimmy.

01:00:45.902 --> 01:00:48.904
So sorry.

01:00:52.142 --> 01:00:54.810
I blew it.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.954
Do you feel anything, Karen?

01:01:05.956 --> 01:01:08.023
No.

01:01:10.827 --> 01:01:13.862
I can't feel my chest.

01:01:13.864 --> 01:01:16.098
Your sternum is held
together with staples,

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:20.802
so it's important that
you hold very still, okay?

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.275
How'd it go?

01:01:28.378 --> 01:01:31.146
Tumor did a lot of damage.

01:01:31.148 --> 01:01:33.915
Much more than we
could see on the MRI.

01:01:33.917 --> 01:01:37.152
It's not good, Karen.

01:01:38.788 --> 01:01:40.856
Am I gonna die?

01:01:40.858 --> 01:01:43.325
You probably have a few weeks.

01:01:43.327 --> 01:01:46.128
Maybe a month.

01:01:56.272 --> 01:01:59.908
Do I have to spend
the rest of it in here?

01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:02.344
This all seems very strange, I know,

01:02:02.346 --> 01:02:05.080
but, uh, you'll be out of here soon

01:02:05.082 --> 01:02:07.683
and back together with your husband.

01:02:07.685 --> 01:02:11.286
No...

01:02:11.288 --> 01:02:13.455
I'm not going to tell him.

01:02:13.457 --> 01:02:14.155
Why not?

01:02:14.157 --> 01:02:17.859
Well, he already knows
too much about everything.

01:02:17.861 --> 01:02:21.229
He doesn't need to know this.

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.868
Don't we have to tell him?

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:30.338
Legally she is the only
one we have to inform.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:33.842
He'll know soon enough
what's happening to me.

01:02:33.844 --> 01:02:34.976
Dr. Roberts?

01:02:34.978 --> 01:02:36.478
Yes?

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.346
I need something from you.

01:02:38.348 --> 01:02:39.881
What's that, Karen?

01:02:39.883 --> 01:02:42.784
I need you to pray for me.

01:02:42.786 --> 01:02:44.286
I'll be sure to...
I want you to pray

01:02:44.288 --> 01:02:47.856
for me now.

01:02:47.858 --> 01:02:49.491
Karen, I don't think
that a prayer is gonna...

01:02:49.493 --> 01:02:53.895
I'm not asking for a miracle, doc.

01:02:53.897 --> 01:02:56.932
Just a prayer.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.883
Dear god, if

01:03:14.885 --> 01:03:17.185
you're there...
He's there,

01:03:17.187 --> 01:03:20.455
doc, he's there.

01:03:20.457 --> 01:03:22.858
We have a woman here...

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.926
I have a name.

01:03:27.964 --> 01:03:32.534
Karen is very sick.

01:03:32.536 --> 01:03:34.436
Be honest, doc.

01:03:34.438 --> 01:03:37.939
Would you let me do this?

01:03:40.977 --> 01:03:45.981
Karen is going to die.

01:03:45.983 --> 01:03:47.783
She has a tumor on her heart

01:03:47.785 --> 01:03:50.952
and there's nothing
that we can do about it.

01:03:50.954 --> 01:03:54.456
So if there's anything
that you can do,

01:03:54.458 --> 01:03:56.458
please do it.

01:03:56.460 --> 01:04:00.462
She's going to be in a lot of pain and

01:04:02.398 --> 01:04:05.967
her husband is going to need help.

01:04:05.969 --> 01:04:09.905
Her family and friends

01:04:09.907 --> 01:04:14.876
and all of us,

01:04:14.878 --> 01:04:19.014
we all need to know something.

01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:26.054
Not everything, just something.

01:04:26.056 --> 01:04:27.255
Amen.

01:04:27.257 --> 01:04:29.357
Amen.

01:04:29.359 --> 01:04:31.960
Amen.

01:04:32.528 --> 01:04:36.031
You should have prayed for
the elevator too, chief.

01:04:42.338 --> 01:04:45.207
Well, Dimples,

01:04:45.209 --> 01:04:47.509
if they haven't
figure it out by now,

01:04:47.511 --> 01:04:49.911
they ain't gonna figure
it out 'til morning.

01:04:49.913 --> 01:04:54.549
So, don't let the bed bugs bite.

01:04:54.551 --> 01:04:56.351
Got any more candy bars?

01:04:56.353 --> 01:04:58.353
I wish.

01:05:03.025 --> 01:05:07.329
You know, you changed me.

01:05:08.464 --> 01:05:11.600
I what?

01:05:11.602 --> 01:05:14.169
Well, you wanted to
prove I was beautiful,

01:05:14.171 --> 01:05:16.872
and the first thing
you did was change

01:05:16.874 --> 01:05:20.275
my hair and makeup.

01:05:20.277 --> 01:05:22.878
Okay, that's called putting
your best foot forward.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.581
I believe the Greeks invented that.

01:05:26.583 --> 01:05:28.650
Well, if you really
thought I was beautiful,

01:05:28.652 --> 01:05:32.921
you would've have
just taken my picture.

01:05:34.957 --> 01:05:36.958
I'm sorry, uh,

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:41.663
who's photo was it that I
just took about 300 times?

01:05:42.632 --> 01:05:44.633
Someone you made
me pretend to be.

01:05:44.635 --> 01:05:47.402
No, that was you.

01:05:47.404 --> 01:05:50.138
I took those pictures of you.

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:51.940
If waking you up and
welcoming you back

01:05:51.942 --> 01:05:55.243
to the rest of us is wrong,
then you can lock me up

01:05:55.245 --> 01:05:57.345
and throw away the key.

01:05:57.347 --> 01:06:01.349
Because when some east
villager with non-prescriptive

01:06:01.351 --> 01:06:04.286
lenses in his glasses
makes concentric circles

01:06:04.288 --> 01:06:07.589
of elephant shit on a
canvas and calls it art,

01:06:07.591 --> 01:06:09.591
I thank Monet.

01:06:09.593 --> 01:06:12.494
I thank him for painting lilypads

01:06:12.496 --> 01:06:15.263
instead of the dead carp floating

01:06:15.265 --> 01:06:18.166
on top of the pond, I lost my metaphor.

01:06:18.168 --> 01:06:20.602
But you know where I'm coming from.

01:06:20.604 --> 01:06:23.939
And I think you liked it.

01:06:27.009 --> 01:06:30.245
I think I want to
take some more pictures.

01:06:36.385 --> 01:06:40.522
You know, I just want to say...

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.161
I'm not afraid to eat you guys if that's

01:06:46.163 --> 01:06:48.330
what it comes down to.

01:06:48.332 --> 01:06:51.032
Think I figured out why
you're still single, Walt.

01:06:51.034 --> 01:06:55.036
There are no secrets in elevators.

01:06:56.072 --> 01:07:00.075
Well, then

01:07:00.077 --> 01:07:03.511
I cheated on my music
theory final at Julliard.

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:07.749
I have flowers sent to
me after every concert.

01:07:09.018 --> 01:07:10.752
I'm the one who farted.

01:07:10.754 --> 01:07:12.420
Owww!

01:07:12.422 --> 01:07:14.022
There can be no retribution,

01:07:14.024 --> 01:07:15.357
it's a confession.

01:07:15.359 --> 01:07:16.691
Depends on what you confess.

01:07:16.693 --> 01:07:19.461
Hey, we should shoot the door open.

01:07:19.463 --> 01:07:21.763
And then what? Shoot our
way through the brick wall?

01:07:21.765 --> 01:07:23.031
Maybe we'll be near an opening.

01:07:23.033 --> 01:07:23.723
Huh?
Okay.

01:07:23.723 --> 01:07:25.068
Give me some room.

01:07:25.068 --> 01:07:29.637
Wait a minute, what
about a ricochet?

01:07:32.675 --> 01:07:34.542
This is a really bad idea.

01:07:34.544 --> 01:07:35.744
Don't do it, Dawn!

01:07:35.746 --> 01:07:36.427
I'll give you my water!

01:07:36.746 --> 01:07:38.747
Forget the water,
open the damn door!

01:07:38.749 --> 01:07:40.081
Don't give up your water, Kendra.

01:07:40.083 --> 01:07:42.384
Maybe we should all just have a sip.

01:07:42.386 --> 01:07:44.085
What? Are we in Africa? Huh?

01:07:44.087 --> 01:07:45.286
It's Kendra's water, she should do

01:07:45.288 --> 01:07:46.721
what she likes with it.

01:07:46.723 --> 01:07:48.456
Everyone who thinks the
water should remain a symbol

01:07:48.458 --> 01:07:49.791
of hope, raise your hand.

01:07:49.793 --> 01:07:51.659
This is  ridiculous, it's her water!

01:07:51.661 --> 01:07:54.062
Shoot the damn door!

01:07:54.064 --> 01:07:56.364
Shut up!

01:07:56.366 --> 01:07:57.766
Or I'll pour it out!

01:07:57.768 --> 01:08:02.037
Okay, fine, okay,

01:08:02.039 --> 01:08:05.306
I will put the gun away.

01:08:05.308 --> 01:08:09.210
But I get to choose the next song.

01:08:09.212 --> 01:08:11.179
I want to hear silent night

01:08:11.181 --> 01:08:14.249
and I want Mandy to play it.

01:08:15.785 --> 01:08:17.419
About halfway down,

01:08:17.421 --> 01:08:19.087
the big black one that looks
like it should be pushed.

01:08:19.089 --> 01:08:22.290
Yeah, you push it again to
take a picture.

01:08:22.292 --> 01:08:24.591
Right, okay, you ready?

01:08:24.594 --> 01:08:25.794
You're so pleased with yourself.

01:08:25.796 --> 01:08:28.763
Well, wouldn't you be?

01:08:28.765 --> 01:08:30.398
I guess I deserved that.

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:32.767
Yes, okay, let's see you work it.

01:08:32.769 --> 01:08:35.069
Come on, Dimples,
show me some emotion.

01:08:35.072 --> 01:08:38.073
Ooh, all right,
you're the ice cream.

01:08:38.075 --> 01:08:39.441
Crack the shell.

01:08:39.443 --> 01:08:41.142
Oh, there it is.

01:08:41.144 --> 01:08:42.176
That's really nice.

01:08:42.179 --> 01:08:43.545
Have you done this before?

01:08:46.383 --> 01:08:50.151
This mascara really
brings out your eyes.

01:08:50.153 --> 01:08:53.688
Really nice look on you.

01:08:59.562 --> 01:09:01.629
I don't know why
you're making me do this.

01:09:01.631 --> 01:09:04.165
Yes, you do.

01:09:04.167 --> 01:09:08.736
3.1415926535358.

01:09:08.738 --> 01:09:13.608
3.14159265358.

01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:18.345
3.14159265358.

01:09:20.616 --> 01:09:21.716
Hello?

01:09:21.718 --> 01:09:25.520
Hey!
Hello?

01:09:25.522 --> 01:09:27.455
You guys okay?

01:09:27.457 --> 01:09:29.491
Ecstatic, yeah.

01:09:29.493 --> 01:09:32.426
We're about to
splice a broken power line.

01:09:32.429 --> 01:09:33.627
It might get a little bumpy.

01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:35.430
I'll check back in a bit,

01:09:35.432 --> 01:09:36.831
see if you need anything.

01:09:36.832 --> 01:09:38.433
All right.

01:09:38.435 --> 01:09:41.870
Actually, we kind of
need something right now.

01:09:41.872 --> 01:09:43.304
What's that?

01:09:43.305 --> 01:09:45.506
Well, we've got a wine bottle,

01:09:45.509 --> 01:09:47.242
an empty wine bottle

01:09:47.243 --> 01:09:49.711
and there's a coin in
it and we want to get

01:09:49.712 --> 01:09:54.315
the coin out without removing the cork.

01:09:55.885 --> 01:09:57.552
Couldn't you
just push the cork down

01:09:57.554 --> 01:10:00.388
into the bottle, then
pour the coin out?

01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:04.459
Ah, yeah, that
might work! Thanks!

01:10:09.765 --> 01:10:11.766
The distances
posed by rural areas

01:10:11.768 --> 01:10:13.768
are no longer an issue.

01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:14.769
Hey, this is security.

01:10:14.771 --> 01:10:15.904
Anybody in there?

01:10:15.906 --> 01:10:17.805
No, no, nobody here.

01:10:17.807 --> 01:10:19.207
We're fine.

01:10:19.209 --> 01:10:20.909
Distances are irrelevant

01:10:20.911 --> 01:10:23.178
as long as the system
itself remains unchanged.

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:25.446
I mean, it's pretty simple, right?

01:10:25.448 --> 01:10:27.382
Right?

01:10:27.384 --> 01:10:29.918
Slap me in the face.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.553
Slap me in the face!

01:10:31.555 --> 01:10:33.321
I feel like I'm having
a dream where I'm stuck

01:10:33.323 --> 01:10:36.257
inside an elevator,
revolutionizing world energy.

01:10:36.259 --> 01:10:37.926
How 'bout we slap each
other at the same time?

01:10:37.928 --> 01:10:38.860
To be sure?

01:10:38.862 --> 01:10:41.262
Great, I'll count.

01:10:41.264 --> 01:10:43.531
One, two, three.

01:10:43.533 --> 01:10:46.335
Oww!

01:10:47.337 --> 01:10:48.369
I still see it.

01:10:48.371 --> 01:10:50.672
I still see it too.

01:10:50.674 --> 01:10:51.873
We're not dreaming.

01:10:51.875 --> 01:10:53.641
We're not dreaming!

01:10:53.643 --> 01:10:55.744
Oh my gosh, you're light.

01:11:06.922 --> 01:11:10.959
Come on, Mandy, you
can do better than that.

01:11:27.543 --> 01:11:29.344
So, uh, what kind of art thing

01:11:29.346 --> 01:11:32.547
were you doing tonight?

01:11:32.549 --> 01:11:35.750
It was at a Christmas benefit.

01:11:35.752 --> 01:11:39.487
Abstract art in a post-abstract world.

01:11:39.489 --> 01:11:40.788
Why don't you give us the tour?

01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:42.957
Oh, seriously, we want to see it.

01:11:42.959 --> 01:11:45.493
I don't think so.

01:11:45.495 --> 01:11:47.462
I "heart" art.

01:11:47.464 --> 01:11:50.798
Nothing better to do.

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:54.569
Oh, right.

01:11:56.872 --> 01:11:59.540
Huh, you seem taller.

01:11:59.542 --> 01:12:01.843
Really?

01:12:12.655 --> 01:12:14.522
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

01:12:14.524 --> 01:12:16.991
and welcome to the
metropolitan museum of art

01:12:16.993 --> 01:12:18.793
and our newest exhibit,

01:12:18.795 --> 01:12:22.463
abstract art in a post-abstract world.

01:12:22.465 --> 01:12:25.033
The French art critic, Andre Gide,

01:12:25.035 --> 01:12:29.637
famously stated that art
is a collaboration between

01:12:29.639 --> 01:12:33.908
god and the artist and the less
the artist does, the better.

01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:36.844
So with that in mind, let's
take a look at some of the

01:12:36.846 --> 01:12:41.949
finest collaborations in the
sunset of the movement itself.

01:12:44.019 --> 01:12:48.656
Leading off our exhibit is
a piece entitled, war cry.

01:12:48.658 --> 01:12:50.925
Based on the title the
viewer might expect

01:12:50.927 --> 01:12:53.895
to be presented with a
traditional battle scene.

01:12:53.897 --> 01:12:56.964
But is instead presented
with the image of a mirror

01:12:56.966 --> 01:13:00.535
painted on a large
chunk of cardboard.

01:13:00.537 --> 01:13:02.837
The image itself doesn't
reflect anything,

01:13:02.839 --> 01:13:04.405
for the viewer has
to complete the piece

01:13:04.407 --> 01:13:06.507
in their own imagination.

01:13:06.509 --> 01:13:08.609
What is it they want to see?

01:13:08.611 --> 01:13:10.878
What are they afraid to see?

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:15.850
And if there is a war cry,
then where is the war?

01:13:15.852 --> 01:13:18.820
Well, perhaps it's in that
location common to us all,

01:13:18.822 --> 01:13:21.489
the human psyche.

01:13:21.491 --> 01:13:24.859
That sacred place where we
decide what we'll fight for

01:13:24.861 --> 01:13:28.730
and what we'll run from.

01:13:28.732 --> 01:13:31.065
Moving on now to
our largest exhibit.

01:13:33.036 --> 01:13:34.669
It's a concrete wall.

01:13:34.671 --> 01:13:37.372
It's 12 feet high, 20 feet long

01:13:37.374 --> 01:13:39.507
and on the left hand side of the wall,

01:13:39.509 --> 01:13:42.844
a single word, "history," written some

01:13:42.846 --> 01:13:47.515
70,000 times, varying
in size and shape,

01:13:47.517 --> 01:13:49.784
they seem to be vying for space,

01:13:49.786 --> 01:13:53.454
pushing and shoving,
hoping to be noticed,

01:13:53.456 --> 01:13:55.456
hoping to be remembered.

01:13:55.458 --> 01:13:56.824
On the right hand
side of the wall,

01:13:56.826 --> 01:14:00.862
the blank side, is just
as much a piece of art

01:14:00.864 --> 01:14:01.929
as the left side.

01:14:01.931 --> 01:14:04.031
Is the blank side the future?

01:14:04.033 --> 01:14:06.567
One suspects, yes.

01:14:06.569 --> 01:14:11.706
Because all 70,000 histories
are written upside down,

01:14:11.708 --> 01:14:15.143
forcing us to read them upside down

01:14:15.145 --> 01:14:18.880
and thus capsizing the
importance of the past.

01:14:18.882 --> 01:14:20.047
And if you focus solely on the past,

01:14:20.049 --> 01:14:22.984
it threatens to
become our present,

01:14:22.986 --> 01:14:26.521
or perhaps, even our future.

01:14:28.057 --> 01:14:29.023
Get it up!

01:14:29.025 --> 01:14:30.892
Get it up more!

01:14:30.894 --> 01:14:32.160
Get away!

01:14:38.901 --> 01:14:43.204
Our next piece is a
sculpture entitled figurehead.

01:14:43.206 --> 01:14:44.772
I like it.

01:14:44.774 --> 01:14:46.674
It calls to mind the
figureheads that adorned ancient

01:14:46.676 --> 01:14:49.811
sailing ships, most often
wooden carvings of women

01:14:49.813 --> 01:14:51.512
or mythical gods.

01:14:51.514 --> 01:14:53.114
This figurehead gives

01:14:53.116 --> 01:14:55.883
few clues as to the
precise being underneath.

01:14:59.088 --> 01:15:02.990
There are hints of an overall shape,

01:15:02.992 --> 01:15:05.960
perhaps a woman,

01:15:05.962 --> 01:15:07.995
possibly trying to emerge.

01:15:07.997 --> 01:15:09.597
It's impossible to
tell, of course,

01:15:09.599 --> 01:15:10.965
because it's hidden
under layer upon layer of

01:15:10.967 --> 01:15:13.100
thick paint, rendering
it almost formless.

01:15:13.102 --> 01:15:14.969
So what's really
underneath all the paint?

01:15:14.971 --> 01:15:16.070
Oh, we don't know.

01:15:16.072 --> 01:15:18.573
Don't you want to know?

01:15:18.575 --> 01:15:20.208
Well, once a mystery's
scheduled for solution,

01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:22.610
it's no longer a mystery, is it?

01:15:22.612 --> 01:15:25.480
It's a problem.

01:15:46.902 --> 01:15:49.570
But my favorite, piece,
and one I really can't wait

01:15:49.572 --> 01:15:51.272
to show you, is this one here.

01:15:51.274 --> 01:15:55.109
It has no title and the
artist refused to sign it,

01:15:55.111 --> 01:15:58.045
not wishing to influence
its interpretation.

01:15:58.047 --> 01:16:02.116
But the unique size
of canvas, the colors,

01:16:02.118 --> 01:16:04.952
the variety of media,
leave it all as open

01:16:04.954 --> 01:16:08.089
to interpretation as possible.

01:16:09.791 --> 01:16:11.726
I wouldn't even know how
to describe it

01:16:11.728 --> 01:16:13.094
if you asked me to.

01:16:13.096 --> 01:16:16.898
Because it defies every
attempt at description

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:19.567
and categorization.

01:16:25.007 --> 01:16:29.076
Help me, Guadalupe!

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:39.120
I doubt the artist
could even reproduce it

01:16:39.122 --> 01:16:41.689
if you asked him.

01:16:44.192 --> 01:16:46.093
Mi amor.

01:16:48.631 --> 01:16:51.332
Art at its very best,

01:16:51.334 --> 01:16:54.001
whatever that is.

01:16:54.003 --> 01:16:56.037
Well, that concludes our tour.

01:16:56.039 --> 01:16:59.674
I'd like to thank you all for
being with us this evening

01:16:59.676 --> 01:17:02.777
and the exhibition is
now yours to explore.

01:17:27.336 --> 01:17:28.803
Is it working?

01:17:28.805 --> 01:17:31.872
My head hurts.

01:17:31.874 --> 01:17:33.774
It's working.

01:17:33.776 --> 01:17:34.775
So Karen, what are you gonna do

01:17:34.777 --> 01:17:37.111
when you get out?

01:17:37.113 --> 01:17:42.216
Um, play my harp

01:17:42.218 --> 01:17:45.753
a lot.

01:17:45.755 --> 01:17:49.757
Eat chocolate cake every night.

01:17:49.759 --> 01:17:53.394
Go for some long drives.

01:17:53.396 --> 01:17:55.796
Whoa!

01:17:55.798 --> 01:17:58.165
Got up too fast.

01:17:58.167 --> 01:17:59.867
Whoa.

01:17:59.869 --> 01:18:01.035
Is he okay?

01:18:01.037 --> 01:18:02.637
He'll be fine,

01:18:02.639 --> 01:18:06.741
but I don't think he
has to go pee anymore.

01:18:07.743 --> 01:18:11.679
So, Karen,

01:18:11.681 --> 01:18:15.082
what kind will you be
driving on those long drives?

01:18:15.084 --> 01:18:20.054
You know, I had an old
Chevy Blazer for a long time,

01:18:20.056 --> 01:18:23.290
drove that thing everywhere.

01:18:23.292 --> 01:18:25.192
But it got stolen
a couple years ago

01:18:25.194 --> 01:18:28.362
so I just bought a used Volvo.

01:18:28.364 --> 01:18:31.232
It's okay, I guess, functional.

01:18:31.234 --> 01:18:33.901
Mostly I bought it for
its color.

01:18:33.903 --> 01:18:36.937
What color is it?

01:18:36.939 --> 01:18:37.872
You know, to think of it,

01:18:37.874 --> 01:18:41.208
it's time for an oil change.

01:18:41.210 --> 01:18:44.311
I will never have to change
the oil again, will I?

01:18:44.313 --> 01:18:49.016
Or pay taxes or clean
the bathroom.

01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:58.426
It's green.

01:19:06.935 --> 01:19:09.103
Hello?

01:19:09.105 --> 01:19:12.940
Oh! Thank you, that's
wonderful news!

01:19:13.775 --> 01:19:14.942
Five more minutes.

01:19:14.944 --> 01:19:16.711
Yeah, we've heard that before.

01:19:16.713 --> 01:19:20.081
I choose to believe it,
everything's gonna be okay,

01:19:20.083 --> 01:19:21.849
back to normal.

01:19:21.851 --> 01:19:23.217
A normal Christmas.

01:19:23.219 --> 01:19:25.119
Well, I don't know about you guys,

01:19:25.121 --> 01:19:28.422
but I'm not going back to normal.

01:19:28.424 --> 01:19:30.091
You know, the only thing
worse than being stuck

01:19:30.093 --> 01:19:32.093
in this elevator is being
stuck in third chair.

01:19:32.095 --> 01:19:35.830
When I get out of here,

01:19:35.832 --> 01:19:37.498
I'm gonna try out for first.

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:40.000
Mmm.
Go Marta.

01:19:40.002 --> 01:19:42.403
I'm done playing
for the dead guys.

01:19:42.405 --> 01:19:46.874
Not another note until it's
something I wrote myself.

01:19:46.876 --> 01:19:51.879
And I'm calling Julliard
and telling them I cheated.

01:19:51.881 --> 01:19:56.817
And I'm gonna visit Karen,
see how her surgery went.

01:19:56.819 --> 01:19:58.953
And how 'bout you, Mandy?

01:19:58.955 --> 01:20:02.089
I really don't know
what I'm gonna do.

01:20:04.926 --> 01:20:07.328
I ain't making no resolution.

01:20:07.330 --> 01:20:09.296
Come on, tough guy!

01:20:09.298 --> 01:20:12.066
You've got to!

01:20:15.303 --> 01:20:16.203
These are great.

01:20:16.205 --> 01:20:18.105
Mmm-hmm.

01:20:18.107 --> 01:20:20.341
They're all you, Dimples.

01:20:23.012 --> 01:20:25.079
So do you work with
other photographers

01:20:25.081 --> 01:20:28.249
or have your own studio or what?

01:20:28.251 --> 01:20:32.987
I work at...  the morgue,

01:20:32.989 --> 01:20:37.358
actually, taking pictures of dead people

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:42.429
for city records and what not.

01:20:43.932 --> 01:20:47.067
No kidding?
No kidding.

01:20:47.069 --> 01:20:51.071
But sometimes, they
were makeup too.

01:20:51.907 --> 01:20:54.041
Walter, Walter, Walter

01:20:54.043 --> 01:20:56.977
Walter, Walter, Walter!

01:20:56.979 --> 01:20:58.813
All right, enough!

01:20:58.815 --> 01:21:00.915
Walter, Walter!

01:21:00.917 --> 01:21:03.884
I'm, finally gonna

01:21:03.886 --> 01:21:06.487
profess my love to the
woman of my dreams.

01:21:06.489 --> 01:21:09.023
Hmm.
Yeah!

01:21:09.025 --> 01:21:13.127
So who's the lucky dame, big guy?

01:21:13.995 --> 01:21:16.463
Dawn.

01:21:22.170 --> 01:21:26.273
I always knew you had
beady eyes for me, Walter.

01:21:27.876 --> 01:21:31.178
Okay, if I keep the backstreet
boys sheets on my bed?

01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:34.114
As long as you're between them.

01:21:34.116 --> 01:21:38.118
Oh, brother.

01:21:43.091 --> 01:21:45.626
Hey! Yes!

01:21:50.899 --> 01:21:53.601
Get out of my way!

01:22:15.624 --> 01:22:18.058
Hello?

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:19.927
Yes.

01:22:22.197 --> 01:22:24.565
Thank-you.

01:22:24.567 --> 01:22:27.968
Thank-you, very much,
thank-you, thank you.

01:22:27.970 --> 01:22:31.105
Merry Christmas.

01:22:56.164 --> 01:22:57.998
There are a few
holes in the roof boys,

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.700
you might want to check 'em out.

01:23:18.387 --> 01:23:21.956
One, two, three, four.

01:23:24.059 --> 01:23:25.559
Hey guys, the power's back up,

01:23:25.561 --> 01:23:29.129
I want to thank all of
you, well, most of you,

01:23:29.131 --> 01:23:30.431
for being so patient.

01:23:30.433 --> 01:23:33.067
We should be moving
in just a second.

01:23:37.105 --> 01:23:38.959
Merry Christmas to us.

01:23:57.126 --> 01:23:59.293
Yes! Yes!

01:23:59.295 --> 01:24:00.494
Get everything, get everything.

01:24:00.496 --> 01:24:04.759
Uh, okay, could
change everything.

01:24:06.434 --> 01:24:08.602
Do you mind if I keep this?

01:24:08.604 --> 01:24:11.405
Knock yourself out.

01:24:11.407 --> 01:24:13.507
I was thinking maybe...
I was thinking.

01:24:13.509 --> 01:24:15.075
go ahead.

01:24:15.077 --> 01:24:17.177
No, no, no, you go.

01:24:17.179 --> 01:24:21.148
I was gonna say, maybe we
should try climbing up the top?

01:24:23.051 --> 01:24:24.518
That's a terrible idea.

01:24:27.123 --> 01:24:30.724
I was gonna say that when
this is finally over,

01:24:30.726 --> 01:24:34.461
if we're not two dead people,

01:24:34.463 --> 01:24:39.266
then we should, uh, yes, yes!

01:24:40.535 --> 01:24:44.038
Yes! Thank you!

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.740
We love you!

01:24:49.245 --> 01:24:52.379
Oh, 6 am.

01:24:52.381 --> 01:24:54.214
What's everybody gonna do now?

01:24:54.216 --> 01:24:56.050
I'm gonna go for a jog

01:24:56.052 --> 01:24:57.384
and then a doughnut.

01:24:57.386 --> 01:25:01.121
I want to go to bed and a movie.

01:25:01.123 --> 01:25:03.090
Hey, Glenn, thanks
for the art, man.

01:25:03.092 --> 01:25:05.392
Yeah, it was neat.

01:25:05.394 --> 01:25:09.763
And Nick, I've just
got to know about,

01:25:09.765 --> 01:25:12.132
well, no, actually, no,
I don't want to know.

01:25:12.134 --> 01:25:15.069
Tim? You never told
us where you were going.

01:25:15.071 --> 01:25:17.371
Oh, I'm headed to the hospital.

01:25:17.373 --> 01:25:19.339
My wife, she had a
small tumor removed.

01:25:19.341 --> 01:25:21.108
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.142
Oh, I hope it went well.

01:25:21.143 --> 01:25:22.144
No, it's no big deal.

01:25:22.144 --> 01:25:26.346
We knew what it was and
we knew how to fix it.

01:25:29.851 --> 01:25:33.087
Call CNN as well.

01:25:33.089 --> 01:25:36.256
I don't know what...

01:25:37.725 --> 01:25:39.359
I Love You!

01:25:39.361 --> 01:25:40.494
Sir, are you okay?

01:25:40.496 --> 01:25:41.762
What's going on in there?

01:25:41.764 --> 01:25:44.098
Wow.

01:25:46.334 --> 01:25:49.269
Been in here a long time.

01:25:48.959 --> 01:25:51.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:25:52.808 --> 01:25:56.110
So are you gonna take the
stairs the rest of the way?

01:25:56.112 --> 01:25:57.544
No, my buddy lives
a few floors up

01:25:57.546 --> 01:26:01.215
so I think I'm going to take
my chances with the beast.

01:26:01.217 --> 01:26:03.150
It helps me.

01:26:03.152 --> 01:26:05.119
Very brave.

01:26:05.121 --> 01:26:07.454
You know, I never
asked you your name?

01:26:07.456 --> 01:26:09.790
Ann.

01:26:09.792 --> 01:26:14.294
Well, Annie, I think the two of us

01:26:14.296 --> 01:26:18.332
should probably see each other
again, relatively quickly,

01:26:18.334 --> 01:26:19.900
someplace with a little more real estate.

01:26:19.902 --> 01:26:22.402
What do you say to that?

01:26:24.472 --> 01:26:26.840
I have a boyfriend.

01:26:30.145 --> 01:26:31.759
No kiddin'?

01:26:32.148 --> 01:26:35.182
No kidding.

01:26:35.184 --> 01:26:39.786
Dashing and loaded,

01:26:39.788 --> 01:26:41.555
I assume.

01:26:41.557 --> 01:26:43.590
He's in tech support.

01:26:45.627 --> 01:26:49.429
Does he have any idea
how beautiful you are?

01:26:52.867 --> 01:26:55.369
I do.

01:27:24.265 --> 01:27:27.434
Crikey, no one even knew we were here.

01:27:27.436 --> 01:27:30.237
Well, we did.

01:27:30.239 --> 01:27:32.773
Come on, guys, bring it in.

01:27:38.247 --> 01:27:40.914
Well, I gotta go, see you guys.

01:27:40.916 --> 01:27:43.350
Get home safe.

01:27:50.692 --> 01:27:52.793
Hi.

01:27:53.494 --> 01:27:55.596
Bye, Glenn.

01:27:55.598 --> 01:27:58.799
Hey, thought I'd come
along for the ride.

01:27:58.801 --> 01:28:01.835
Jogging, we're gonna get doughnuts.

01:28:01.837 --> 01:28:04.471
Oh, I really want to watch that movie.

01:28:04.473 --> 01:28:05.939
Yeah.

01:28:16.284 --> 01:28:18.552
Thanks.

01:28:31.266 --> 01:28:32.833
Ohhh, excuse me!

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.909
Dude!

01:28:42.911 --> 01:28:45.512
It's no big deal.

01:28:56.758 --> 01:29:00.294
Well, looks like I'm going like this.

01:29:00.296 --> 01:29:01.728
Fantastic!

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:15.475
Damn biker!

01:29:30.692 --> 01:29:32.993
Hey, Happy Birthday

01:29:32.995 --> 01:29:34.695
and Merry Christmas.

01:29:34.697 --> 01:29:37.331
I'm so sorry I missed
the party last night.

01:29:37.333 --> 01:29:38.799
Oh my gosh, don't
worry about it.

01:29:38.799 --> 01:29:39.000
I didn't make it either.

01:29:39.001 --> 01:29:42.569
Look, I'll see you soon and
I'll tell you all about it

01:29:42.571 --> 01:29:46.340
but you are never gonna
believe what happened to me.

01:29:47.375 --> 01:29:48.975
Try me.

01:31:53.701 --> 01:31:56.937
Dude, you're late for a lesson, yah?

01:31:56.939 --> 01:32:00.040
Where have you been?

01:32:00.042 --> 01:32:02.075
I don't know.

01:35:00.087 --> 01:35:02.155
Guys?

01:35:03.190 --> 01:35:04.290
Guys?
