00:02.127 --> 00:03.594
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:03.795 --> 00:04.921
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.088 --> 00:08.592
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:08.759 --> 00:11.262
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

00:11.428 --> 00:14.272
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

00:14.431 --> 00:16.024
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

00:16.183 --> 00:17.810
<i>I am something else.</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:20.771
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

00:21.897 --> 00:23.149
Previously on Arrow...

00:25.275 --> 00:27.573
You are not going to be Bratva Captain
for much longer.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.411
Susan Williams. She's suspecting
that Oliver's the Green Arrow.

00:31.573 --> 00:32.573
What are we gonna do?

00:32.741 --> 00:34.789
Hack into her computer,
and find out what's there and delete it?

00:34.952 --> 00:35.953
- She has...
- Everything.

00:36.119 --> 00:39.965
Apparently, I have been plagiarizing
my stories for the past two years.

00:40.123 --> 00:43.548
And my laptop is filled
with incriminating evidence.

00:43.752 --> 00:46.596
But now, I've been thoroughly discredited.

00:46.797 --> 00:50.301
Did you hack Susan Williams' computer?

00:50.467 --> 00:52.219
Thea asked me to put a few things
on Susan's computer and...

00:52.386 --> 00:54.388
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Thea asked you?

00:54.555 --> 00:58.105
<i>The Mayor's Office ordered
the falsification of autopsy reports</i>

00:58.350 --> 01:01.149
<i>to protect the identity
of Detective Malone's killer.</i>

01:01.478 --> 01:03.856
<i>If any of these allegations prove true,</i>

01:04.022 --> 01:06.775
<i>it would likely trigger impeachment
proceedings led by the Mayor's...</i>

01:06.942 --> 01:09.491
This might be
the end of my administration.

01:13.156 --> 01:16.160
When did you learn
the Green Arrow killed Detective Malone?

01:16.326 --> 01:18.328
Why did you protect the Green Arrow?

01:18.495 --> 01:20.168
We have no comment at this time,

01:20.330 --> 01:23.254
but we will have
something for you shortly. Thanks.

01:25.627 --> 01:29.473
I've called in every favor I could.
I still don't know how this got leaked.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.850
We know how it got leaked.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.345
It's Prometheus.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.389
He sent the ACU after me
as the Green Arrow,

01:37.556 --> 01:39.058
and now,
he is coming after me as the Mayor.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.976
For something he set you up for
in the first place.

01:41.143 --> 01:42.690
Nobody's saying the guy isn't smart.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.948
We're just gonna have to be smarter.
What's the plan, boss?

01:46.106 --> 01:47.198
We don't have a plan yet,

01:47.691 --> 01:51.662
but if we lose this office,
then Prometheus wins.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.198
I just realized,
am I allowed to be in here?

01:54.364 --> 01:56.082
Usually, the detail stands outside.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.458
Better go blend in.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.245
Okay, well, on the political front,

01:59.411 --> 02:01.960
I think the plan should be to deny,
deflect, obfuscate...

02:02.122 --> 02:04.420
- That's just gonna confuse people...
- Yeah, but that's the point.

02:04.583 --> 02:08.213
What if we tell the truth?
A version of the truth.

02:08.377 --> 02:12.975
"The Green Arrow is a good guy
and I gave him the benefit of the doubt."

02:13.133 --> 02:14.385
You know what, it worked on Pike.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.103
I'll tell the vultures
you're gonna be making a statement.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.481
Okay, do you want me to write you a draft?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.483
No, I'll write it.
I need you to handle something for me.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.643
Okay.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.187
- You need to make things right with Susan.
- Ollie...

02:25.354 --> 02:27.823
You got her fired
under false pretenses, Thea.

02:27.981 --> 02:31.076
Only because I was trying to protect you,
which is what I'm doing now.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.035
- Yes, Adrian.
- Mr. Mayor.

02:35.572 --> 02:36.824
What's this?

02:36.990 --> 02:40.335
My letter of resignation, in which I take
sole responsibility for the cover-up.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.121
- No.
- The cover-up was my idea.

02:42.371 --> 02:43.998
I approved it. I'm the Mayor.

02:44.206 --> 02:47.961
And if this impeachment proceeding
goes the way that I think it will,

02:48.168 --> 02:49.340
not for long.

02:58.595 --> 03:02.395
The Council has broad powers to run
impeachment hearings as it sees fit.

03:02.557 --> 03:05.401
It calls its own witnesses,
enters its own evidence,

03:05.560 --> 03:07.562
they take a vote, majority rules.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.276
But Oliver can't defend himself?

03:09.439 --> 03:11.407
It's not a criminal trial.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.944
The Council needs a pound of flesh,
and I'm volunteering.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.455
- And I've already said no.
- Yeah, I'm persistent.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.868
I have a better idea.
Be my lawyer at the hearings.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.627
- Mr. Mayor...
- It's "Oliver".

03:22.786 --> 03:25.585
And I'm not your boss anymore,

03:25.747 --> 03:27.374
I'm your client.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.383
I have many reasons for killing Anatoly.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.803
Biggest is his poisoning Bratva
with American scum.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.843
Fine.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.134
What?

04:22.512 --> 04:24.105
Take them.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.400
What'd you do?

04:27.559 --> 04:29.812
Extend our lives by length of good movie.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.452
All right, lady, do your thing.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.253
That was not your thing.

04:46.453 --> 04:49.127
Boss is getting impeached
and you're down here playing marbles?

04:49.331 --> 04:50.332
Actually, this was your idea.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.546
You're the one who encouraged me
to lean into

04:51.708 --> 04:52.709
the strengths with my tech, remember?

04:52.876 --> 04:54.298
You said that.
We were walking down the alley,

04:54.461 --> 04:55.462
you were like,
"Lean into your strengths..."

04:55.629 --> 04:56.630
- You literally said that!
- I didn't...

04:56.797 --> 05:00.051
Anyway. These are two inventions of mine,

05:00.217 --> 05:02.390
two autonomous mini-drones.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.726
One with offensive,
and the other with defensive capabilities.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.392
So, what,
you can't handle yourself on the field,

05:08.558 --> 05:11.232
you've gotta give yourself
a pair of balls?

05:12.437 --> 05:14.565
That was... That was too harsh, wasn't it?

05:14.731 --> 05:17.826
You think? Yeah, it was,
but, you know what? You recognized it.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.578
- Yeah, 'cause I'm trying to work on...
- Yeah, that's progress.

05:20.737 --> 05:24.082
Anyway, Paul's big problem
with me being Mr. Terrific

05:24.241 --> 05:25.618
was the fact that he was worried.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.412
But now, he doesn't have to worry
with these bad boys in my arsenal.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.047
Sounds like you got
the emotional logic all figured out.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.378
<i>L</i> do.

05:32.541 --> 05:35.511
Now, if I can just get
these damn things to work.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.923
<i>News of the cover-up sent shockwaves
through City Hall,</i>

05:39.172 --> 05:42.893
<i>forcing Council members into enacting
a rarely-used impeachment clause.</i>

05:43.093 --> 05:45.846
<i>Mayor Oliver Queen's administration
might be over.</i>

05:46.012 --> 05:47.355
That woman never reports good news.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.851
It'll work out.
I'm just waiting for my opening.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.360
There's that optimism again.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.613
Chase is representing me,
so I'm gonna beat this.

05:54.813 --> 05:58.067
How are we doing with the
data pull from Prometheus' mother's house?

05:58.275 --> 06:00.744
The sniffer pulled about
a petabyte worth of data,

06:00.902 --> 06:02.904
it's like looking for
a needle in a haystack,

06:03.071 --> 06:04.744
- but I am working on it.
- Good.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.908
There's something else
that I could use your help with.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.247
- Okay.
- Susan Williams.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.083
- Oh.
- She's not returning my calls.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.123
Am I really the best person
to come to for love-life advice?

06:13.290 --> 06:15.418
She's not returning my calls
since you and Thea got her fired.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.757
Well, in my defense, I didn't know
that was gonna be Thea's play.

06:17.919 --> 06:21.173
I know, but I still need your help
because Thea is not budging.

06:22.465 --> 06:27.221
Look, I know how severely problematic
what I'm about to say is,

06:27.387 --> 06:32.985
but Susan is your girlfriend,
so, if anyone is going to fix it,

06:33.143 --> 06:34.645
- I think it has to be you.
- I'm trying,

06:34.811 --> 06:36.438
but like I said,
she's not returning my calls,

06:36.605 --> 06:37.822
and you may have noticed,

06:37.981 --> 06:39.824
I'm sort of facing an impeachment
this week.

06:41.902 --> 06:46.328
- Okay. Yeah, I'll do my best.
- Thank you very much.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.534
Um...

06:48.992 --> 06:49.993
For what it's worth,

06:50.243 --> 06:53.463
and everything I know about politics
I got from <i>Keepin' it 1600,</i>

06:53.663 --> 06:55.131
but I do think
you're gonna beat this thing.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.462
What makes you so sure?

06:56.625 --> 06:59.629
To Star City,
Mayor Oliver Queen is a hero.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.487
Bang.

07:24.611 --> 07:28.366
This marks only the second time
in the 140-year history of this city

07:28.531 --> 07:30.625
that a mayor has faced impeachment.

07:30.784 --> 07:34.038
In 1898, Mayor Prescott
was removed from office.

07:34.204 --> 07:38.960
We'll see what fate awaits Oliver Queen,
who's stepping into the building now.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.057
Hey, I'll catch you up there, all right?

07:48.802 --> 07:51.021
- Hi, Susan.
- Sorry, busy reporting for my new blog.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.476
I'm sorry, I've been trying...

07:52.639 --> 07:55.438
My first entry will be about
how you never took this job seriously.

07:55.684 --> 07:59.484
As Mayor, you've just phoned it in.
You'll only ever be that other guy.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.565
But, of course,
I can't write that

08:01.773 --> 08:04.822
because no one will believe me
now that you've trashed my credibility.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.699
I had nothing to do with that,
but I am working

08:06.903 --> 08:08.576
- to make it right, I'm...
- Whatever. You deserve today.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.913
Hey, so, what do you think
Oliver's chances are?

08:17.080 --> 08:19.253
Come to order.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.339
We're about to find out.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.634
We recently learned
that Detective William Malone

08:24.796 --> 08:28.972
was murdered by the vigilante
known as the Green Arrow.

08:29.217 --> 08:34.097
It appears
that the Mayor knew some time ago,

08:34.264 --> 08:38.940
and actively worked to hide the fact,
even from the SCPD.

08:39.102 --> 08:42.356
Today, the Council considers
two grave questions.

08:42.605 --> 08:47.782
<i>Did Oliver Queen's actions
violate the oath he took faithfully</i>

08:48.194 --> 08:50.196
to serve Star City?

08:50.488 --> 08:55.460
<i>And should he therefore be
removed as Mayor?</i>

08:55.744 --> 08:58.122
- Hell to the no!
- What he said.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.458
It's Paul. Should I take it?

09:01.624 --> 09:03.752
I'm not gonna take it.
Maybe I should take it.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.012
No, no. Okay, I'll take it.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.385
- Hey.
- This is so completely unfair.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.050
Yeah, that seems to be
going around lately.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.261
So, you got Oliver's girlfriend fired?

09:12.427 --> 09:13.644
He told you? Of course he told you.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.396
Well, did he also tell you
it was a mistake?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.102
- I mean, on my part at least?
- Felicity.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.517
I'm putting the toothpaste
back in the tube, okay?

09:18.683 --> 09:19.684
- And how is that going?
- Well...

09:19.851 --> 09:21.649
- Felicity, what's going on with you?
- What do you mean?

09:21.811 --> 09:22.812
This week it was Oliver's girlfriend.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.105
Last month,
he tells me you're getting involved

09:24.272 --> 09:25.273
in some stuff
you shouldn't be involved in?

09:25.440 --> 09:26.532
Well, that is a matter of perspective

09:26.691 --> 09:28.910
considering that that "stuff"
helped get you out of prison,

09:29.069 --> 09:31.071
- and General Walker's gun-sights.
- What're you talking about?

09:35.784 --> 09:36.956
"Pandora"?

09:37.118 --> 09:39.291
It's a data cache compiled
by a group of hacktivists called Helix.

09:39.454 --> 09:41.582
They collect electronic dirt
on literally billions of people,

09:41.748 --> 09:43.091
including General Walker.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.718
So, when I asked for it
to get you off, they...

09:45.877 --> 09:47.379
That's a bad choice of words.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.173
They gave me the whole package.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.592
And you're still in bed with these people.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.351
What? You make it sound like
it's a bad thing.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.853
Pandora's just a tool.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.228
Sounds to me like this could be a weapon.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.060
Okay. And is there a problem if it is?

09:58.223 --> 10:00.271
- It depends, Felicity.
- On what?

10:00.433 --> 10:01.810
On how you use it.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.858
My autopsy showed that
mortal injury on the deceased

10:08.024 --> 10:10.777
was consistent with the edging of
the arrowheads used by the Green Arrow.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.823
I have here,
your original Cause of Death Report,

10:13.988 --> 10:17.709
<i>in which you conclude
that the Green Arrow killed Malone,</i>

10:17.867 --> 10:21.371
but this report,
it was never included in the case file.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.585
Why is that?

10:22.747 --> 10:24.374
The DA came to me, and I...

10:24.541 --> 10:26.669
You're referring to Adrian Chase?

10:27.293 --> 10:28.636
That's correct.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.548
He instructed me to revise the report
to indicate

10:31.714 --> 10:33.887
that the Throwing Star Killer
was responsible.

10:34.592 --> 10:35.593
This report.

10:35.760 --> 10:39.310
And you went ahead and signed it,
even though you knew it was fake,

10:39.472 --> 10:41.770
<i>and then passed it along to the police.</i>

10:41.933 --> 10:43.230
Is that the case?

10:43.393 --> 10:45.441
- Yes.
<i>- Why?</i>

10:45.603 --> 10:47.981
Did Mr. Chase threaten you?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.571
He didn't have to.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.488
He said the request came
from the Mayor himself.

10:56.823 --> 10:57.824
The Mayor?

10:57.991 --> 11:01.165
Yes, he told me
the Green Arrow killed Detective Malone.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.705
And did Mayor Queen say why?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.332
He said the Throwing Star Killer,

11:05.498 --> 11:07.876
a man we've been calling Prometheus,
manipulated him.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.044
<i>Did he say why this Prometheus</i>

11:10.211 --> 11:12.714
would wanna orchestrate
Detective Malone's murder?

11:12.881 --> 11:13.882
No.

11:14.215 --> 11:17.469
<i>Standing here today, do you believe
what Mr. Queen has told you?</i>

11:21.890 --> 11:23.107
Honestly, I'm not sure.

11:23.266 --> 11:27.191
<i>He's clearly been determined to protect
the Green Arrow for his own purposes.</i>

11:27.353 --> 11:30.823
I think the question here is, why?

11:36.905 --> 11:38.157
Coming through.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.330
Who's most in our corner?

11:45.496 --> 11:47.214
- Pollard, believe it, or not.
- That's not surprising.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.920
She can't call in the marker
I owe her for helping

11:49.083 --> 11:50.551
with the gun reform if I'm impeached.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.802
I'll touch base with her,

11:51.961 --> 11:54.555
see if I can get her to call you
to testify in your own defense, okay?

12:05.141 --> 12:08.566
Okay, well, I...
I have a very political idea.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.820
I'm listening.

12:09.979 --> 12:14.610
Like Adrian said, the Council needs
somebody thrown to the wolves,

12:14.776 --> 12:16.449
and I think it should be Malone.

12:16.611 --> 12:17.658
- Thea!
- What?

12:17.820 --> 12:21.165
Half the SCPD is corrupt,
so, it's not hard to believe.

12:21.324 --> 12:26.000
And he is no longer with us,
so, he wouldn't really mind.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.507
That way, the cover-up is
no longer about the Green Arrow,

12:29.666 --> 12:34.046
it becomes about protecting Malone's
reputation for the sake of his family.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.055
Now you're gonna
destroy his reputation. No.

12:36.214 --> 12:38.308
- But, Ollie...
- Thea, it's not even a question.

12:40.510 --> 12:41.636
Okay.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.060
How do we think the Council's gonna vote?

12:44.222 --> 12:47.852
It's a pretty even split
with Kullens as the swing vote.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.447
Hold on!

13:13.501 --> 13:16.095
My target's the Mayor and his corruption.

13:16.254 --> 13:19.349
He surrenders,
I'll let the rest of you live.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.393
Good man.

13:26.514 --> 13:27.731
Good woman.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.064
Hey, hey, get to safety, get to safety.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.322
- Quentin, the driver!
- Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.255
You want me? Come on!

14:04.761 --> 14:07.856
Lucky you. You get one more day.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.615
Okay, all right.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.826
Look, I appreciate what you're doing,
but I'm fine.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.615
Mr. Mayor, all due respect,

14:25.782 --> 14:29.127
your head's bleeding and our concussion
protocol's even stricter than the NFL's.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.788
Well, I'm the Mayor, so I'm suspending it.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.965
The, uh. Your driver, he's okay.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.296
Yeah, he took a hit on his shoulder,

14:36.459 --> 14:38.052
and he's got a bump on the head,
but he's fine.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.090
And before you ask, he didn't see you turn
all Bruce Lee back there.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.633
- Where's Dinah?
- She's doing her job, working the scene.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.473
All right, I gotta get to the Bunker, l...

14:45.635 --> 14:46.887
- Oh, boy.
- Easy, Ollie.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.930
You know
there's a concussion protocol, right?

14:49.097 --> 14:50.269
Yeah, so I've heard.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.354
- This was Vigilante?
- Yeah.

14:52.517 --> 14:56.488
Apparently, because of the
impeachment hearing, I'm a criminal.

14:56.646 --> 14:59.820
- You okay?
- Oh. Never felt better.

15:02.318 --> 15:06.164
Hey, so, I made sure the unis keep
all the press behind the cordon.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.496
Trust me, you don't want them
snapping shots of you in an ambulance.

15:09.659 --> 15:10.831
Yeah, no ambulance.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.995
But I'm tougher than I look.
I'm gonna get back to the office.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.379
Where have I heard that before?

15:14.539 --> 15:16.883
Hey, look, while under threat
of the impeachment,

15:17.041 --> 15:19.920
you can't exactly amend by-laws,
so that concussion protocol?

15:20.086 --> 15:21.258
Yeah, it's a thing.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.924
It's okay, Ollie,
I can go back to the office

15:24.090 --> 15:26.013
and tell everyone
we're gonna be working overtime.

15:26.175 --> 15:30.180
Plus, I'm never getting into a limo
with you again.

15:34.267 --> 15:38.147
Oliver's on his way to Starling General,
but don't worry, he'll be fine.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.859
I heard shots were fired on the motorcade.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.569
Yeah, flipped our limo in the air.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.860
- Cool.
- Not "cool," more like "ow,"

15:44.026 --> 15:45.448
and Oliver might be concussed.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.330
But in the meantime,
there's still the Vigilante out there.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.490
Okay, Rene and I
are gonna hit the streets,

15:49.657 --> 15:52.001
see if we can't muscle the Vigilante's
whereabouts out of some people.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.288
Curtis, let's check the Key Hole satellite
and CC thermal cams.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.956
Actually, hold on. I need a favor.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.965
Okay, if this is about Susan Williams,
I'm already on it.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.172
No, it's about the impeachment.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.053
You said that Pandora
has dirt on a lot of people, right?

16:03.212 --> 16:05.465
Yeah, if by "a lot of people,"
you mean "everybody," then, yeah.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.723
What about Councilman Kullens?

16:06.883 --> 16:08.100
Last time I checked,
he's part of "everybody."

16:08.259 --> 16:09.385
- Why?
- You know why.

16:09.594 --> 16:10.595
Oh. Oh!

16:12.054 --> 16:13.101
You wanna blackmail him?

16:13.264 --> 16:16.939
No. It's not blackmail, it's politics.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.113
<i>In the wake of the attack,
Councilman Kullens</i>

16:21.272 --> 16:23.900
<i>has called a brief recess
to the impeachment hearings.</i>

16:24.150 --> 16:26.448
<i>If the Mayor is medically cleared,
the Council will vote tomorrow.</i>

16:26.861 --> 16:28.078
Okay.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.412
Well, sounds like you need a note
from your doctor, Mr. Mayor.

16:31.574 --> 16:34.202
This is ridiculous,
I know what real injury feels like.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.417
I can only imagine, given your other job.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.333
And you're right, your CAT scan is clear.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.878
- Good.
- Uh-uh-uh. Not so fast.

16:43.044 --> 16:46.048
Look, I can't discharge you without
a few more hours of observation.

16:46.214 --> 16:47.340
Doctor Schwartz...

16:47.507 --> 16:50.181
People can withstand only so much strain.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.688
And being both Mayor and him,
it's unsustainable.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.348
I assure you, my body can handle it.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.860
I'm not talking about your body,
Mr. Queen.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.440
I'm talking about this.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.526
The mind needs rest,

17:02.688 --> 17:06.818
or at least someone to take your thoughts
off all the evil you face each day.

17:06.983 --> 17:10.454
Doctor Schwartz,
are you prescribing me a girlfriend?

17:10.613 --> 17:12.490
Or just a friend.

17:31.634 --> 17:34.137
<i>Hi, this is Susan.
I can't come to the phone...</i>

17:41.143 --> 17:42.816
"Demand an exam"?

17:42.979 --> 17:44.572
Yeah, it rhyme better in Russian.

17:44.730 --> 17:49.156
<i>Spros dopros</i> is Bratva way
to call <i>Pakhan</i> to account for actions.

17:49.318 --> 17:52.743
Captains all listen,
maybe Pakhan lose position.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.327
That's good news!

17:54.490 --> 17:56.993
That's good. That means we can
overthrow Gregor without a fight.

17:57.451 --> 18:00.079
No. Everybody knows about
Gregor's deal with Kovar.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.998
No, no, we still end up dead.

18:02.164 --> 18:05.509
Men who call, vote, are killed
if Pakhan keeps position.

18:05.668 --> 18:06.760
Anatoly, why bother?

18:06.919 --> 18:09.513
I did not want to die
in hospital basement.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.008
That's... Fair.

18:12.174 --> 18:16.020
Look, all we have to do is find evidence
that Gregor's deal with Kovar

18:16.178 --> 18:18.146
benefits him and not the Bratva.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.853
Yes, but where are we going to find that?

18:22.810 --> 18:23.857
I have to go.

18:24.020 --> 18:27.695
Code says you have one hour to finalize
personal affairs before <i>Spros dopros.</i>

18:27.857 --> 18:28.858
I can do that.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.698
But you must have Captain with you,
who is not me.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.032
I'll lose him.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.864
I'm really good at losing people.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.836
I've got bullet fragments and casings
coming out of my ass,

18:48.002 --> 18:49.424
but nothing new.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.716
All right, I'll catch you back downtown.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.692
Hey, Johnson,
gotta make room for a tow truck.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.238
- Anything?
- Nada.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.907
Peeps on the street are actually
more afraid of the Vigilante than us.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.075
What about you?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.835
Vigilante changes artillery supplier
every week.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.079
Every lead goes cold.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.497
We could really use
a break right about now.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.129
<i>I think I got something.</i>

19:27.291 --> 19:28.964
Yes! I totally manifested that!
What do you got?

19:29.126 --> 19:33.973
When my sonic cry hit Vigilante,
it knocked off a small piece of his visor.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.929
It looks like it's lined
with some kind of circuitry.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.093
Well, that means it's manufactured.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.761
Maybe I can link to back
to where he bought it from.

19:38.928 --> 19:39.929
I think I can do you one better.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.599
My T-Spheres can actually track the tech
to the individual user.

19:42.765 --> 19:44.984
Except they won't be ready
till the iPhone 16 is released.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.110
- Ye, of little faith...
- What's a T-Sphere?

19:47.269 --> 19:48.316
Curtis' balls.

19:48.479 --> 19:52.279
They're something really fascinating,
and of my own personal invention.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.993
I realized that quantum computation

19:54.193 --> 19:55.911
<i>- could be</i> used to...
- All right, yeah, forget I asked.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.697
<i>I'll bring you guys the visor, okay?</i>

19:57.863 --> 20:00.992
Copy that, we're here.
Curtis, this is on you now.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.284
Challenge accepted.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.499
Hey, seriously, man,
what's up with your balls?

20:04.662 --> 20:06.710
I mean, you were literally gonna
throw those things in the trash.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.001
Paul called, asked me to dinner.
Like, a date.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.670
Like, I'm gonna get my man back.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.555
I told you, hoss,
some piece of tech ain't gonna...

20:14.714 --> 20:17.058
Look, I know Paul,

20:17.633 --> 20:22.309
he wouldn't be asking me to go out
to dinner if he wasn't ready to reconcile.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.401
Personal call?

20:32.565 --> 20:35.284
Uh, yeah, I had a family emergency.
I'm sorry.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.196
Don't be. Family's important.

20:38.988 --> 20:42.492
Hey, why don't I log that in for you?

20:42.658 --> 20:44.501
So you can handle your emergency.

20:45.035 --> 20:46.036
Uh...

20:46.579 --> 20:49.048
Don't worry, I'll take good care of this.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.675
And, uh, I hope everything's okay
with your family.

21:10.519 --> 21:13.648
- Oliver Queen is mine.
- Not if I kill him first.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.319
Yes.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.080
I'd like to report a sighting
of Vigilante.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.583
This is District Attorney Chase.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.553
<i>Hey, Oliver's out of the hospital,
headed to City Hall.</i>

22:18.712 --> 22:19.929
Any word from Dinah?

22:20.089 --> 22:22.933
Um, she's at the precinct, trying to
recover that piece of Vigilante's visor.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.060
What about you, Felicity?

22:25.219 --> 22:29.941
And don't tell me that it's traffic cams,
we both know they're on autopilot.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.400
I sent Thea something
to sway Councilman Kullens.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.485
Apparently, he's the swing vote
on Oliver's impeachment.

22:36.647 --> 22:37.648
Pandora?

22:37.815 --> 22:39.783
Officially, his wife died in a car crash.

22:39.942 --> 22:42.115
Unofficially, she crashed the car
on purpose.

22:42.278 --> 22:44.280
- Suicide?
- He used his clout to cover it up,

22:44.446 --> 22:45.993
so I'm guessing
he's not gonna want it uncovered.

22:46.156 --> 22:48.124
And you are okay with this, right?

22:48.284 --> 22:50.332
I think the city needs Oliver
to keep being Mayor.

22:50.494 --> 22:53.418
Felicity, Kullens is not a criminal,
he's a human being.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.128
He's a politician,
that's hardly the same thing.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.339
A human being that went through
a very tragic accident,

22:57.501 --> 22:59.344
a very private one.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.012
Come on, this isn't you.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.139
Well, it pretty much is.

23:04.466 --> 23:07.470
Okay, do you know what your superpower is?

23:07.636 --> 23:10.185
- Computers?
- Empathy.

23:10.848 --> 23:14.352
Big, reflexive, pure empathy.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.737
- Well, maybe I'm fresh out.
- Because of Billy.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.321
It's a dark world.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.156
And for the past four years,

23:23.319 --> 23:26.823
I have watched you and Oliver
and Laurel and Thea and Roy,

23:26.989 --> 23:28.662
I've watched all of you
use a little darkness to fight it.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.667
That's true.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.375
Sometimes, we do fight fire with fire,

23:33.537 --> 23:36.086
but every time we do, Felicity,
every single time,

23:37.583 --> 23:39.381
we risk being burned.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.141
Well, some days, I can't help but feel

23:46.300 --> 23:48.268
as if this city
wants to collapse in on itself,

23:48.427 --> 23:50.179
and all we're doing is
delaying the inevitable.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.019
No, we're preventing it.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.854
We're the good guys,
don't you forget that, all right?

23:54.016 --> 23:57.145
Whack-a-mole.
We got Prometheus, the Vigilante.

23:57.311 --> 23:59.985
And the one wild card I thought
maybe might be on our side,

24:00.147 --> 24:01.649
<i>just murdered a cop.</i>

24:01.815 --> 24:03.988
- Nah, the Green Arrow got played.
- I don't know.

24:04.151 --> 24:06.495
What I do know is
the next Mayor owes me a raise.

24:06.654 --> 24:10.249
Yeah, I'll put in a word with Mayor Queen.
He's not impeached yet.

24:10.407 --> 24:11.579
All right.

24:18.582 --> 24:19.925
Please tell me you didn't send it.

24:21.543 --> 24:24.217
The thing with Kullens' wife,
he doesn't deserve that.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.849
- Felicity told you, didn't she?
- Thea...

24:27.007 --> 24:29.135
I haven't sent the email, okay?

24:29.301 --> 24:33.351
Ollie, don't look at me like that,
it's politics!

24:33.639 --> 24:37.018
There's about to be a vote,
so it's time to play hardball.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.027
This isn't hardball, this is cruel.

24:39.186 --> 24:41.405
What would be cruel is
the people of this city

24:41.563 --> 24:42.780
not having you as the Mayor.

24:42.940 --> 24:45.068
The Anti-Crime Unit,

24:45.234 --> 24:48.158
low-income housing,
commonsense gun legislation.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.073
Ollie, in the short amount of time
you've been doing this,

24:51.240 --> 24:52.913
you've done a remarkable job.

24:53.075 --> 24:56.670
Please, just let me do what I have to do
to help you keep doing that.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.706
Felicity told me about this Kullens thing

24:58.872 --> 25:00.715
because of something
that John said to her.

25:02.418 --> 25:05.513
Thea, when you fight fire with fire,
you are probably gonna get burned.

25:05.671 --> 25:08.720
I won't. It'll be fine.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.054
Like it was with Susan?

25:11.593 --> 25:15.473
You destroyed her career,
now you've graduated to blackmail.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.602
Where does it stop?

26:22.915 --> 26:25.009
Magic hands.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.930
The magnetic resonance frequencies
within Vigilante's tech

26:30.089 --> 26:32.387
are now communicating with my T-Spheres.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.017
Great. So what does it mean?

26:34.176 --> 26:36.224
Can we catch the Vigilante, or not?

26:36.386 --> 26:41.483
Well, cross your fingers
and your toes.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.359
<i>It's working!</i>

26:50.526 --> 26:52.870
The T-Sphere's picking up on the signal
from the piece of visor!

26:55.280 --> 26:57.703
Yeah, but the other one's still wonky.

26:57.866 --> 26:58.867
No, no, it's not.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.002
It's actually tracking
the rest of the visor.

27:01.161 --> 27:03.038
- Let's take down this SOB.
- Without Oliver?

27:03.205 --> 27:06.004
If Vigilante gets to him, we'll be
doing this without Oliver permanently.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.713
- Let's suit up.
- Suit up!

27:07.876 --> 27:10.299
Oh. Sorry, I thought since Oliver's gone,
I would, probably...

27:10.462 --> 27:12.214
But it makes more sense probably for you...

27:12.381 --> 27:14.475
I'll make sure I'll work on
the timing there. Promise.

27:16.844 --> 27:19.563
- Balls.
- My. T-Spheres. Don't call 'em "balls."

27:26.603 --> 27:27.729
You speak with Pollard?

27:27.896 --> 27:30.695
She won't call you to testify
without Kullens' blessing.

27:30.858 --> 27:31.905
We're not gonna get that.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.569
And the Council hearing directly
from you

27:33.735 --> 27:35.487
is only one of two ways
I can see us winning this thing.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.531
- What's the second way?
- You won't like it.

27:37.698 --> 27:39.826
Does it involve
offering up a sacrificial lamb?

27:39.992 --> 27:41.835
Either me, or Detective Malone.

27:42.911 --> 27:46.085
Oliver, this impeachment
is about punishing someone,

27:46.248 --> 27:47.545
and if you don't offer up a name,

27:47.708 --> 27:49.756
this'll be the last time
you're looking out that window.

27:53.964 --> 27:56.763
If the Council is not gonna let me
testify at the hearing,

27:56.925 --> 27:59.223
then I need to take my case
directly to the public.

27:59.386 --> 28:01.229
- A press conference?
- Yeah.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.641
Mind filling me in on
who you're throwing under the bus?

28:09.855 --> 28:10.902
The Green Arrow.

28:29.791 --> 28:30.917
Right here.

28:32.794 --> 28:33.886
And, stop.

28:36.465 --> 28:39.218
- Dude, we got him?
- I think so.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.432
- Oh. This is bad.
- Why <i>is that?</i>

28:41.595 --> 28:43.222
<i>The building that
you just stopped in front of?</i>

28:43.388 --> 28:45.436
Well, City Hall is located
directly behind it, offering

28:45.599 --> 28:47.442
perfect line-of-sight to where
Oliver is giving his speech.

28:47.601 --> 28:49.444
It's the Vigilante's Book Depository.

28:49.603 --> 28:50.900
Felicity, we need you
to check the blueprints.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.064
<i>Yeah, already on it.</i>

28:52.231 --> 28:54.154
Okay, the sixth floor is under renovation.
Dollars to donuts...

28:54.316 --> 28:55.568
That's where he'll be.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.309
Yeah. I'm listening.

29:29.393 --> 29:31.191
Yeah, copy that.

29:32.437 --> 29:35.611
Vigilante is across the street.
Sixth floor.

29:35.774 --> 29:39.870
He's gonna take you out as soon as
you walk outside into the open.

29:40.028 --> 29:43.498
- Is the team on site?
- Yeah.

29:45.617 --> 29:46.789
Then it'll be fine.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.358
<i>Good evening, everyone.</i>

30:10.517 --> 30:14.147
<i>I'd like to thank the City Council
for conducting these hearings</i>

30:14.313 --> 30:15.986
<i>with honesty and integrity.</i>

30:16.148 --> 30:21.871
<i>Simply wish that I could've done the same
with regards to the Green Arrow's</i>

30:22.029 --> 30:25.124
<i>murder of Detective William Malone.</i>

30:27.492 --> 30:30.541
- Terrific, where is he?
- This way, this way!

30:43.592 --> 30:44.593
What's so funny?

30:44.801 --> 30:46.724
I think I just found
a new use for my T-Sphere.

30:46.887 --> 30:48.013
Your what?

30:49.765 --> 30:54.362
<i>When I took the oath of office,
I promised to be honest and forthright.</i>

30:54.519 --> 30:56.942
<i>I never wanted to be a politician</i>

30:57.105 --> 31:02.111
<i>who relied on dirty politics
or underhanded tactics.</i>

31:04.404 --> 31:06.122
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

31:11.953 --> 31:13.125
Oh, no.

31:16.124 --> 31:19.128
<i>And in the spirit of that transparency,</i>

31:19.294 --> 31:23.094
<i>I think I owe everyone an explanation
as to why</i>

31:23.256 --> 31:25.179
<i>I covered up what the Green Arrow did.</i>

31:49.658 --> 31:54.835
<i>I did it in a misguided attempt
to protect everyone from the tragic news</i>

31:54.996 --> 31:57.090
<i>that the Green Arrow
had become a cop killer.</i>

31:57.249 --> 31:58.250
What?

31:58.417 --> 32:02.718
<i>That a man we had put our faith in
had failed this city.</i>

32:03.505 --> 32:06.179
<i>I didn't think that we could afford
to lose another hero.</i>

32:07.426 --> 32:08.518
<i>Hey, Vigilante!</i>

32:08.677 --> 32:10.554
I got two of these.

32:15.308 --> 32:19.404
- Nice aim.
- That's the thing, they aim themselves.

32:23.483 --> 32:24.484
Awesome!

32:26.278 --> 32:28.121
Awesome!

32:31.116 --> 32:34.040
You're awesome. That was badass.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.580
- That mean no more ball jokes?
- Hell, no.

32:41.543 --> 32:44.717
Remind me to thank Cisco
for that upgraded Kevlar.

32:44.880 --> 32:48.885
- You guys all right?
- Yeah, but what about Oliver?

32:49.342 --> 32:51.720
<i>But the truth is more important,</i>

32:51.887 --> 32:54.481
<i>and the truth is that
the Green Arrow has gone rogue.</i>

32:54.639 --> 32:59.566
<i>We must disavow him, we must hunt him,
and punish him for what he has done.</i>

33:00.812 --> 33:03.031
<i>Green Arrow is not a hero.</i>

33:06.318 --> 33:10.573
<i>He is what's keeping Star City from being
the best that it can be.</i>

33:13.533 --> 33:14.705
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

33:26.755 --> 33:27.802
They're still deliberating.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.932
Well, that's taking longer than I thought.

33:30.091 --> 33:32.594
Yeah, well,
you gave them plenty to think about.

33:32.761 --> 33:36.106
So, how's it feel, huh?
Making yourself into a villain like that?

33:38.475 --> 33:39.601
Susan Williams is here.

33:39.768 --> 33:40.769
You want me to say you're busy?

33:40.936 --> 33:43.610
No! No, I'd like to tell the truth
for the rest of the day,

33:43.772 --> 33:45.194
if at all possible. Please send her in.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.734
All right.

33:47.609 --> 33:49.236
<i>Susan, please.</i>

33:50.445 --> 33:51.697
Thank you.

33:53.740 --> 33:54.787
I'm glad you're here.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.454
- Susan, I'm very sorry.
- I got my job back.

33:58.620 --> 34:03.171
An anonymous hacker confessed
that the plagiarism story was fake.

34:03.333 --> 34:06.462
Said they were just messing with us.
My boss apologized.

34:06.628 --> 34:09.347
Well, that's good news.
Still though, I'm really sorry.

34:09.505 --> 34:11.474
Are you? What I mean is,

34:11.632 --> 34:13.726
you didn't know about this
beforehand, did you?

34:13.885 --> 34:15.683
No, I had no idea.

34:15.844 --> 34:19.440
But once you did,
you made them make it right. Right?

34:19.849 --> 34:23.023
- Are we off the record?
- Yes.

34:23.812 --> 34:26.485
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

34:27.815 --> 34:28.987
So, what happens next?

34:29.150 --> 34:32.449
You mean, what do I do with your secret?
I keep it.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.364
I care about this city,
and you're working double-time

34:35.574 --> 34:36.996
to make it a better place.

34:37.199 --> 34:41.545
I do appreciate that, but I meant,
what happens next with us?

34:42.414 --> 34:43.666
Uh...

34:45.667 --> 34:48.295
Sorry to interrupt,
but I think you'll be happy that we did.

34:49.963 --> 34:51.761
Council voted

34:51.922 --> 34:53.219
against impeachment.

34:56.344 --> 34:59.598
Thank you so much, Adrian,
I could not have done this without you.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.516
Are you kidding me? No thanks needed.

35:01.683 --> 35:05.483
You're not just my boss, Oliver,
you're my friend.

35:08.565 --> 35:11.489
I'm gonna go give Thea the good news.
I'll be right back.

35:11.651 --> 35:12.777
Okay.

35:14.863 --> 35:18.709
Hey, no need to pack up, we won.

35:18.867 --> 35:21.211
We both get to keep our jobs.

35:21.369 --> 35:22.871
Yeah, not...

35:24.039 --> 35:25.165
Not both of us.

35:25.915 --> 35:29.215
Look, Ollie, you... You were right. I...

35:30.211 --> 35:33.590
I am getting deeper and deeper
into the mud lately,

35:33.757 --> 35:36.385
and it's like my bloodlust last year,

35:36.551 --> 35:39.304
except instead of arrows and swords,

35:39.471 --> 35:41.974
I've replaced it with
politics and slanders, so I am...

35:42.140 --> 35:44.984
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
that you have to quit, Thea.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.520
- I need you here...
- Ollie, please.

35:46.686 --> 35:49.906
Please don't ask me to stay,
because I will.

35:50.565 --> 35:51.782
I will for you.

35:53.234 --> 35:56.113
But I am broken. Okay?

35:57.072 --> 35:59.166
I need you to let me go.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.253
Let me go, so, I can try to fix myself.

36:05.622 --> 36:06.748
Well...

36:11.419 --> 36:14.673
- Your resignation's accepted.
- Thank you.

36:25.266 --> 36:27.860
My resignation letter's on the desk.

36:33.108 --> 36:35.827
When I signal,
you must align with Anatoly,

36:35.985 --> 36:39.285
who called <i>Spros dopros,</i>
or Gregor, our incumbent <i>Pakhan</i>.

36:39.447 --> 36:41.950
Now, let's get this over with quickly.

36:54.295 --> 36:55.296
Hey, stop!

36:55.463 --> 36:57.136
Mr. Queen, you do not have floor.

36:57.298 --> 36:58.720
Just give me 10 seconds,

36:58.883 --> 37:02.228
listen to what I have to say,
and if you don't like it, shoot me.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.890
As you wish.

37:08.476 --> 37:12.151
This laptop contains
80 million rubles in transfers

37:12.313 --> 37:15.317
from Kovar's accounts
to accounts that Gregor controls.

37:15.483 --> 37:18.908
Yes, we know this,
to spread among Bratva captains.

37:19.070 --> 37:25.544
It also contains 40 million rubles worth
of bank transfers from Kovar

37:26.745 --> 37:28.873
that Gregor hasn't disclosed.

37:30.331 --> 37:33.335
Open it. Ask him if it's true.

37:34.836 --> 37:37.760
<i>Is this true, Gregor?</i>

37:44.137 --> 37:47.357
40 million rubles. So, it's true.

37:47.515 --> 37:51.190
If anybody wishes to cast a new vote,
please do so now.

38:00.737 --> 38:03.035
It seems that
you are deciding vote, Viktor.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.246
What say you, my friend?

38:09.954 --> 38:11.456
We have a new Pakhan.

38:11.873 --> 38:14.001
This is most disappointing.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.553
I liked many of you.

38:22.884 --> 38:24.852
- Council isn't impeaching.
- Yes!

38:25.053 --> 38:26.179
- Still the mayor.
- Whoo!

38:26.346 --> 38:28.690
Yet, the Green Arrow is
Public Enemy Number One.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.270
We've dealt with
the police on our backs before.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.527
Not like this, one of their own is dead.

38:32.685 --> 38:33.686
Dinah's right.

38:33.853 --> 38:36.732
And now we know just how much the police
can interfere with our work here.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.150
Can I go?

38:38.316 --> 38:40.284
I'm kind of
getting back together with Paul.

38:40.443 --> 38:42.116
It's a big deal.

38:42.278 --> 38:45.782
- Can I leave? Can I...
- Yes! Yes, of course. Go.

38:45.949 --> 38:48.043
Have fun.
Everyone should have fun tonight.

38:48.201 --> 38:49.748
Just quickly though,

38:49.911 --> 38:52.630
I might have buried the headline here.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.585
You all saved my life.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.128
And five months ago,

38:58.294 --> 39:00.968
I never would've thought
that was possible.

39:02.549 --> 39:05.849
Thank you for working hard,

39:06.010 --> 39:07.683
thank you for banding together,
thank you for being...

39:07.846 --> 39:10.770
Sorry. L...
I mean, thank you for saying thank you.

39:10.932 --> 39:14.436
Wow. Man to man, that means a lot,
but I'm really late to see Paul, so...

39:14.602 --> 39:15.945
- Give Paul my best.
- Thank you!

39:16.104 --> 39:18.607
- Good luck.
- Good luck!

39:21.484 --> 39:22.827
Oh. Thank you.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.866
I'm sorry.

39:28.616 --> 39:32.211
Sorry, we were stopping an assassination.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.043
Can you believe
I stopped an assassination?

39:34.205 --> 39:36.299
Wow.

39:37.125 --> 39:41.972
So, on the way over here,
I rehearsed what I would say to you.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.808
How I would win you back,

39:47.552 --> 39:49.099
tell you I love you.

39:49.679 --> 39:51.932
You know, I just started with...

39:52.473 --> 39:55.022
That was definitely not
how I planned on opening,

39:55.268 --> 39:57.691
but can I start again? I'ma start again.
When I came to...

39:57.854 --> 40:00.824
It's nice to see you, Curtis. I mean that.

40:01.608 --> 40:04.157
As much as you're going to think
that I don't.

40:04.527 --> 40:05.619
What?

40:12.827 --> 40:14.420
Are you divorcing me?

40:15.246 --> 40:18.876
I'm sorry. I really am.

40:40.063 --> 40:41.531
- Felicity!
- Hi!

40:41.689 --> 40:43.657
Lam so glad you got in touch.

40:43.816 --> 40:46.660
- Though I am a little surprised?
- Yeah, me, too.

40:46.819 --> 40:49.072
Well, "surprised" isn't actually

40:49.238 --> 40:51.366
the right word to describe
how I'm feeling.

40:51.532 --> 40:53.580
What's the right word?

40:53.743 --> 40:55.040
Ready.

40:55.203 --> 40:56.295
A good friend of mine

40:56.454 --> 40:58.752
told me that if you're gonna try
to fight fire with fire,

40:58.915 --> 40:59.962
you're gonna get burned,

41:01.584 --> 41:03.052
but then another friend of mine

41:03.211 --> 41:05.885
came through something
pretty scary tonight

41:06.047 --> 41:07.799
because he had backup,

41:09.050 --> 41:10.347
a team.

41:10.510 --> 41:12.933
You're accepting the invitation
to join Helix?

41:13.096 --> 41:16.225
Yes. Full throttle.

41:23.731 --> 41:24.732
Susan.

41:25.650 --> 41:26.651
Oh. Hey.

41:27.276 --> 41:30.371
- I thought we could talk.
- About?

41:31.531 --> 41:32.578
An exclusive.

41:32.740 --> 41:36.210
Can we set up the meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.

41:40.915 --> 41:45.091
The thing is that this story,
it's important.

41:47.130 --> 41:49.258
You could call it life or death.
