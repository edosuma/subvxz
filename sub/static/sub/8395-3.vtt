WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:04.682
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
SHE GOT INTO A BAD GROUP

00:04.720 --> 00:06.472
IN MINNESOTA,
AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER.

00:06.520 --> 00:07.657
- I REALLY LIKE YOU.

00:07.690 --> 00:09.681
I REALLY WANT TO MAKE A GO
OF THIS.

00:09.730 --> 00:11.482
- YOUR MOM TOLD ME
THAT YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK

00:11.520 --> 00:12.589
TO WYOMING WITH HER.

00:12.630 --> 00:15.212
- I DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER OPTIONS.

00:15.250 --> 00:17.286
- I'M PREGNANT.
- HE DOESN'T KNOW?

00:17.320 --> 00:20.380
- NOT YET.
I JUST STARTED TELLING PEOPLE.

00:20.430 --> 00:23.354
- YOUR DIAGNOSTICS
SHOW MULTIPLE BLOCKAGES.

00:23.400 --> 00:28.463
I'M AFRAID IT'S TIME
TO TALK ABOUT SURGERY.

00:28.510 --> 00:32.059
- IT WAS IN
ANOTHER LIFETIME...

00:32.100 --> 00:35.308
- I WAS TALKING TO SHEILA AGAIN
ABOUT HER HUSBAND'S SURGERY.

00:35.340 --> 00:36.568
YOU KNOW,
HE HAD THE SAME SURGERY

00:36.620 --> 00:37.609
THAT YOU'RE HAVING?
- MM-HMM.

00:37.650 --> 00:40.210
- AND SHE SAID SOME OF THE ROOMS
AT THE HOSPITAL

00:40.240 --> 00:43.300
HAVE BEAUTIFUL VIEWS
OF THE COURTYARD.

00:43.350 --> 00:44.829
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

00:44.870 --> 00:47.521
- OH, BOY,
DOESN'T THAT SOUND EXCITING.

00:47.560 --> 00:50.245
WE CAN WATCH THE SQUIRRELS
FORNICATE.

00:50.290 --> 00:51.598
THAT'LL BE A HOOT.

00:51.630 --> 00:53.495
- YOU'RE GONNA BE
AT THE HOSPITAL FOR A FULL DAY

00:53.530 --> 00:57.284
BEFORE THE PROCEDURE, SO I JUST
THINK IT'D BE NICE, YOU KNOW,

00:57.330 --> 00:58.536
YOU HAD A BEAUTIFUL VIEW.

00:58.570 --> 01:00.299
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:00.330 --> 01:05.267
THE ONLY VIEW I'M GONNA
NEED IS YOU SITTING NEXT TO ME.

01:05.300 --> 01:09.509
- NOW, LOOK,
YOU'VE SEEN THE CARDS.

01:09.550 --> 01:11.233
- [chuckles]
[door opens]

01:11.270 --> 01:13.898
- HEY, ANYBODY HOME?

01:13.930 --> 01:15.727

01:15.760 --> 01:19.378

01:27.810 --> 01:29.903

BEFORE HIS BIG DAY.

01:29.950 --> 01:31.668
- WELL, THANKS, CROSBY.

01:31.710 --> 01:33.393

- I'M GOOD.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.303
WE'RE GOOD. YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.
- HE DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

01:44.340 --> 01:45.375
- YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

01:45.410 --> 01:48.208
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.468
- DON'T MAKE HIM
STRESSED OUT, NOW.

01:49.520 --> 01:50.919
- HE'S ALREADY STRESSED OUT.

01:50.970 --> 01:53.586
- NOW, LOOK, YOU GUYS,
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

01:53.630 --> 01:56.929
I MEAN,

01:56.970 --> 02:01.179
THAT'S LIKE BA'I'I'ING 900,

I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.267

02:49.300 --> 02:50.369

STRESSED

02:50.410 --> 02:52.366
ABOUT HAVING TO TELL EVERYBODY
ANYWAY,

02:52.410 --> 02:53.786
AND YOU DID IT FOR ME.

02:53.820 --> 02:55.993
BESIDES, IT'S A GREAT STORY
WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE.

02:56.030 --> 02:58.203

THAT'S OKAY?
- WELL, YEAH. I MEAN,

03:22.990 --> 03:26.232
HE, SHE, IT DOESN'T MA'I'I'ER.

IT'S YOUR BABY.

03:32.690 --> 03:36.968
SO HOW'S RYAN DOING
WITH ALL THIS?

03:37.000 --> 03:41.380

04:00.860 --> 04:04.068
I'M GONNA

04:25.430 --> 04:26.840
I'M SO SCARED.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.462

I MEAN, I GET THE FEAR,

04:29.510 --> 04:31.011
YOU KNOW, AND BEING SCARED.

04:31.060 --> 04:33.642
MY GOD, I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH
IT THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.056

SWEETHEART.

I KNOW IT'S SCARY,

04:46.450 --> 04:49.101
BUT YOU'RE GONNA GET THROUGH IT

04:49.150 --> 04:50.549
BECAUSE OF HOW STRONG YOU ARE,

04:50.600 --> 04:54.422
AND WE ALL GET OUR STRENGTH
FROM YOU.

04:54.460 --> 04:59.466
SO YOU'RE GONNA BE TOTALLY FINE.

05:00.430 --> 05:03.319
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

05:05.850 --> 05:07.738
- AH, BOY,
I WISH YOU WERE MY DOCTOR.

05:07.790 --> 05:10.406

05:41.090 --> 05:43.399
MAY YOU GROW UP

05:43.440 --> 05:45.817
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

05:45.860 --> 05:48.169
AND SEE THE LIGHT
SURROUNDING YOU

05:48.200 --> 05:50.657
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

05:50.690 --> 05:53.033
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

05:53.070 --> 05:54.958
AND MAY YOU STAY

05:55.000 --> 05:58.413
FOREVER YOUNG

05:58.460 --> 06:00.075

BEFORE THAT, YEAH.

06:24.170 --> 06:26.889
- I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD'VE--

06:26.930 --> 06:29.751
I SHOULD'VE COME OVER THE SECOND
THAT EVERYBODY KNEW.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.143
I SHOULD'VE--
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU, FIRST.

06:32.180 --> 06:36.105
LIKE, YOU'RE THE CLOSEST PERSON
TO ME, AND SOMEHOW,

06:36.150 --> 06:39.699
THAT MADE IT THE SCARIEST
TO TELL YOU ABOUT.

06:39.740 --> 06:40.832
- AMBER, I TOTALLY--

06:40.880 --> 06:42.848
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

06:42.880 --> 06:43.972
IT'S TOTALLY FINE.

06:44.020 --> 06:47.672
I'M JUST--I WANNA KNOW
HOW YOU'RE DOING, YOU KNOW?

06:47.710 --> 06:49.439
- OKAY.
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

06:49.470 --> 06:50.778
WHAT'S RYAN SAYING ABOUT IT?

06:50.820 --> 06:53.926
- UH, WELL, THAT'S KIND OF WHAT
I CAME HERE TO TALK

06:53.960 --> 06:56.849
TO YOU ABOUT, ACTUALLY, UM--

06:56.890 --> 06:58.710
UH, HE DOESN'T KNOW YET,

06:58.760 --> 07:03.242
AND I JUST WOKE UP FEELING
LIKE I HAD TO TELL HIM TODAY,

07:03.280 --> 07:07.205
SO I JUST WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD BORROW YOUR CAR,

07:07.250 --> 07:09.525
BECAUSE MINE'LL NEVER
MAKE IT TO WYOMING.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.868
- ARE YOU TRYING TO DRIVE THERE?

07:10.910 --> 07:13.526
- YEAH, I JUST FEEL
LIKE I NEED TO, YOU KNOW,

07:13.570 --> 07:14.878
TELL HIM TO HIS FACE, SO--

07:14.910 --> 07:16.878
- I MEAN, CAN'T YOU CALL HIM,
OR SOMETHING, OR--

07:16.910 --> 07:19.913
- I FEEL LIKE I OWE IT TO HIM
TO TALK TO HIM,

07:19.950 --> 07:22.839
PERSON-TO-PERSON, ABOUT THIS.
- YOU DON'T OWE HIM ANYTHING.

07:22.890 --> 07:26.121
- OKAY, DREW, THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT I HAVE TO DO,

07:26.160 --> 07:29.641
AND WHETHER I BORROW YOUR CAR
OR SOMEONE ELSE'S,

07:29.690 --> 07:30.952
I'M GONNA GO UP THERE, SO--

07:31.000 --> 07:33.093
- I'M JUST--
I'M GOING UP THERE WITH YOU.

07:33.140 --> 07:34.858
- WHAT?
- I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU

07:34.900 --> 07:36.106
GO UP THERE AND TALK TO HIM--
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO WITH ME.

07:36.140 --> 07:38.176
- YEAH, I KNOW, BUT I DON'T WANT
YOU TO GO UP THERE ALONE.

07:38.210 --> 07:40.132
- FOUND A PIECE OF ME

07:40.180 --> 07:41.272
- I GO'I'I'A CHANGE REALLY QUICK.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.834
- STARING AT THE SEA

07:43.870 --> 07:48.000
- DAD?

07:48.050 --> 07:50.837
DAD?
- MMM.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.110
- DAD?
- YEAH, YEAH, HOLD ON A SECOND.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.775
I JUST FIGURED OUT
THIS DAMN LIGHTING.

07:54.810 --> 07:55.947
- YOU SAID
YOU'D TAKE ME SHOPPING.

07:55.990 --> 07:58.879
- COME ON.

07:58.920 --> 07:59.909
- DOES HE TUNE YOU OUT TOO,

07:59.960 --> 08:02.747
OR IS IT JUST ME?

08:02.790 --> 08:05.611
- HUH? TUNE ME OUT?

08:05.650 --> 08:07.515
OH, HE DOES, YES. OH, YES.

08:07.550 --> 08:08.824
- WELL, WILL YOU PLEASE TELL HIM

08:08.860 --> 08:10.612
THAT HE'S SUPPOSED TO TAKE ME
TO THE MALL? HE'S IGNORING ME.

08:10.660 --> 08:11.752
- YES, I WILL. HANK?
- I'M NOT IGNORING YOU.

08:11.800 --> 08:12.653
FIVE MINUTES, THAT'S IT.
FIVE MINUTES.

08:12.690 --> 08:14.965
- YOU SAID THAT,
LIKE, FIVE HOURS AGO.

08:15.010 --> 08:16.796
GOD, I'M--
I'M SICK OF BEING STUCK HERE.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.796
- HANK? YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SICK OF BEING STUCK HERE,

08:18.840 --> 08:21.525
SO LET'S GO ACROSS THE STREET
TO THE DRUG STORE.

08:21.570 --> 08:23.288
IT'S NOT THE MALL, BUT THEY'VE
GOT A GREAT SELECTION

08:23.330 --> 08:25.844
OF LIP GLOSS. YOU WANT TO GO?
- GREAT.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.256
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.

08:27.290 --> 08:29.292
HEY, HANK,
WE'RE LEAVING FOR A LITTLE BIT.

08:29.330 --> 08:31.537
GONNA DO SOME SECRET GIRL STUFF.

08:31.580 --> 08:32.979
HAN K, REGISTER.

08:33.020 --> 08:35.671
REGISTER, HANK.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.689
- YEAH.
- OKAY, TALK TO YOU LATER.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.540
- YOU GUYS GOING?

08:40.580 --> 08:42.059
- OKAY, ADAM
JUST TALKED TO MY MOM.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.580
THEY HAVEN'T EVEN
TAKEN HIM INTO HIS ROOM YET.

08:44.620 --> 08:46.656
WHY IS THIS TAKING FOREVER.

08:46.690 --> 08:48.100
- I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
YOUR OLD MAN'S A TOUGH GUY.

08:48.140 --> 08:51.212
HE'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

08:51.250 --> 08:53.036
WELL, I MEAN, HE SEEMS TOUGH,

08:53.080 --> 08:55.048
YOU KNOW, FROM WHAT YOU'VE TOLD
ME ABOUT HIM.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.809
AND THAT ONE TIME I MET HIM,
HE SEEMED TOUGH AS HELL.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.808
- WHEN DID YOU MEET HIM?

08:58.840 --> 09:00.808
- YOU DON'T REMEMBER.
- YOU DID NOT MEET MY DAD.

09:00.850 --> 09:02.602
- I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER
THAT I DID NOT

09:02.640 --> 09:04.676
INTRODUCE YOU TO MY PARENTS
BECAUSE MY DAD HAS A WAY

09:04.710 --> 09:07.816
OF MAKING INTRODUCTIONS
TO BOYFRIENDS VERY MEMORABLE.

09:07.850 --> 09:09.124
- MM-MM, YOU DON'T REMEMBER
BECAUSE IT WAS BEFORE

09:09.160 --> 09:10.787
WE WERE DATING.

09:10.820 --> 09:14.608
IT WAS OUR FRESHMEN STUDY GROUP
IN YOUR DORM ROOM.

09:14.650 --> 09:16.026
AHH, YOU REMEMBER NOW,
DON'T YOU?

09:16.070 --> 09:19.301
- YES,
I COMPLETELY BLOCKED THAT OUT.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.625
- MM-HMM. HE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
WHERE YOU WERE, SO HE WAS JUST

09:21.660 --> 09:23.059
WALKING AROUND THE COMPLEX,
SCREAMING YOUR NAME.

09:23.110 --> 09:27.217
- YELLING, YEAH,
"JULIA, DAMN IT!"

09:27.250 --> 09:28.103
- AND THEN,
HE FOUND YOUR COMPLEX,

09:28.150 --> 09:29.799
AND HE WALKED
RIGHT IN YOUR APARTMENT

09:29.840 --> 09:31.831
WITH YOUR FINALS SURVIVAL KIT.
- CANDY.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.802

09:33.840 --> 09:35.876

T-SHIRT, IF I RECALL CORRECT LY.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.388
- MM-HMM,
THAT IS DEFINITELY MY DAD.

09:38.430 --> 09:40.887
HE WILL NOT, TO THIS DAY,
ADMIT THAT I WENT TO STANFORD.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.126
- I THOUGHT IT WAS PRE'ITY COOL
THAT YOUR OLD MAN

09:42.160 --> 09:46.369
DROVE ACROSS THE BAY JUST
TO BRING YOU A BOX OF TWIZZLERS.

09:48.930 --> 09:50.648
- MY FAVORITE STUDY SNACK.
- I KNOW.

09:50.690 --> 09:51.782
IT STILL IS.

09:51.830 --> 09:53.684
- HOW DO YOU REMEMBER THIS?

09:53.730 --> 09:54.958
THIS CRAZY DETAIL.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.345
- IT TOOK ME SIX MONTHS TO GET
THE COURAGE TO ASK YOU OUT.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.244
I WAITED FIVE DATES.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.724
YOU BLEW ME OFF
BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME

10:01.770 --> 10:03.101
THAT YOU HAD TO FOCUS ON SCHOOL.

10:03.150 --> 10:04.424
- I WAS VERY FOCUSED.

10:04.460 --> 10:07.145
- YOU WERE, INDEED, VERY, VERY
FOCUSED, AND VERY ADORABLE TOO.

10:07.190 --> 10:11.320
[phone ringing]

10:14.950 --> 10:15.848

AHEM. HEY.

10:21.200 --> 10:24.681
[pop music playing]

10:24.720 --> 10:26.824
- HOW ARE YOU LIKING
THE NEW SCHOOL?

10:26.860 --> 10:31.934
- IT'S OKAY.
- YEAH, WELL, IT PROBABLY

10:31.970 --> 10:33.892
TAKES A LITTLE TIME, YOU KNOW,
TO GET USED TO IT.

10:33.940 --> 10:35.862
- IT'S--IT'S OKAY.

10:35.910 --> 10:38.902
LIKE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRY
AND MAKE CONVERSATION WITH ME.

10:38.940 --> 10:42.899
WE CAN JUST SHOP.

10:42.950 --> 10:45.157
- OH, ALL RIGHT. HEY, HELP
ME PICK A COLOR, THOUGH.

10:45.190 --> 10:46.737
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

10:46.780 --> 10:48.361
IT'S KIND OF A CLASSIC.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.152
- RED'S FOR OLD PEOPLE.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.747
- RED IS--RED IS FOR OLD PEOPLE.

10:51.780 --> 10:54.192
OKAY, WELL,
I DON'T WANT THAT ONE, THEN.

10:54.230 --> 10:57.199
WHAT IS--WHAT IS A GOOD COLOR?

10:57.240 --> 11:01.688
- YOU SHOULD GET THE RED.

11:01.730 --> 11:02.719
_ 1--

11:10.220 --> 11:15.248
- RUBY, DID YOU
WANT TO BUY A LIP GLOSS?

11:15.290 --> 11:17.941
- NAH, I'M GOOD.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.843
- WOW, LOOK AT THIS.

11:25.890 --> 11:27.949
THIS IS A BETTER VIEW
THAN THE COURTYARD.

11:27.990 --> 11:29.878
- OKAY, MR. BRAVERMAN,

11:29.930 --> 11:32.160
THIS WILL BE YOUR HOME WHILE YOU
COME OFF YOUR BLOOD THINNERS.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.259
THERE IS YOUR GOWN. YOU
CAN GO 'HEAD AND PUT THAT ON,

11:34.310 --> 11:36.926
AND PUT YOUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS
INTO THE PLASTIC BAG.

11:36.970 --> 11:40.929
YOUR CLOTHING, YOUR JEWELRY,
DON'T FORGET YOUR WEDDING RING,

11:40.970 --> 11:44.098
AND--WE'LL GET YOUR IV GOING,
OKAY?

11:44.150 --> 11:45.458
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO WITH MY STUFF?

11:45.490 --> 11:46.866
- I'M SORRY,
WHAT'S THAT, MR. BRAVERMAN?

11:46.910 --> 11:47.934
- WHERE YOU GONNA PUT MY STUFF?

11:47.980 --> 11:53.213
- WE'LL PUT IT IN THE CLOSET.

11:53.260 --> 11:54.534
- THAT'S MY WEDDING RING--

11:54.570 --> 11:56.322
SOLID GOLD.

11:56.370 --> 11:57.814
- IT'S VERY SAFE,
MR. BRAVERMAN.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.159
- HMM, YEAH.
I'M SURE IT'S SAFE.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.816
- WELL, YOUR WIFE CAN TAKE
YOUR STUFF HOME WITH HER,

12:02.860 --> 12:03.781
IF THAT MAKES YOU FEEL BE'I'I'ER.

12:03.820 --> 12:05.048
- ACTUALLY,
I'M SPENDING THE NIGHT HERE.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.544
- WELL, I PROMISE,

12:06.580 --> 12:08.992
MR. BRAVERMAN, WE'LL TAKE
VERY GOOD CARE OF YOUR THINGS.

12:09.030 --> 12:12.921
- I'M NOT PUTTING
MY WEDDING RING IN THE CLOSET.

12:12.970 --> 12:16.133
- I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO LET
YOU KEEP ANYTHING. I'M SORRY.

12:16.180 --> 12:17.863
THEY WON'T ALLOW ANY JEWELRY
INTO THE OPERATING ROOM.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.527
- I'LL GIVE IT TO ONE
OF THE KIDS.

12:19.560 --> 12:22.358
ADAM WILL TAKE IT.
I'LL GIVE IT TO ADAM.

12:22.390 --> 12:23.869
- OKAY, HERE'S--

12:23.910 --> 12:25.798
HERE'S HOW THIS IS GONNA WORK.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.899
THIS IS NOT
AN OPERATING ROOM.

12:27.950 --> 12:31.249
THIS IS A CRAPPY, LITTLE ROOM
WITH A VIEW OF DEAD PEOPLE.

12:36.820 --> 12:39.926
THIS IS MY LAST NIGHT
WITH MY WIFE,

12:39.960 --> 12:45.967
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'M GONNA KEEP MY RING, OKAY?

12:47.620 --> 12:48.791
- YEAH.

13:01.430 --> 13:03.227
- IS IT THAT OAK TREE?

13:03.260 --> 13:04.466
- YOU KNOW THAT IT'S NOTHING,

13:04.500 --> 13:06.252
'CAUSE I'M NOT PLAYING I SPY.
I DON'T WANNA PLAY I SPY.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.155
- WHY WON'T YOU PLAY WITH ME?
IT'S SUCH A LONG DRIVE.

13:09.200 --> 13:13.921
- 'HAVE TO KEEP MY EYES
ON THE ROAD.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.063
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA SAY
TO RYAN?

13:15.100 --> 13:18.376
LIKE, HOW DOES ONE GO
ABOUT THIS TRICKY BUSINESS?

13:18.410 --> 13:20.139
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY TO HIM?

13:20.170 --> 13:21.865
I MEAN,
WHAT IS THE POINT OF GOING?

13:21.900 --> 13:24.209
LIKE, DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT YOU JUST WANT TO TELL HIM?

13:24.250 --> 13:27.242
- WELL, YEAH. THE POINT
IS THAT I WANT HIM TO KNOW

13:27.280 --> 13:31.387
THAT I'M GONNA HAVE THIS, LIKE,
CHILD THAT'S BOTH OF OURS'.

13:31.430 --> 13:34.422
YOU KNOW, BUT, LIKE,
I MEAN, I GUESS, HONESTLY,

13:34.460 --> 13:38.499
WHAT I REALLY WANT FROM HIM
IS JUST TO TELL HIM THAT, LIKE,

13:38.540 --> 13:40.087
I WANT TO DO THIS ON MY OWN.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.157
AND, YOU KNOW?
- YEAH, JUST TELL HIM THAT.

13:56.140 --> 13:57.129
YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:57.180 --> 13:59.136
I SPY--
- YEAH,

13:59.180 --> 14:00.556
WHAT DO YOU SPY?
- WITH MY LITTLE EYE...

14:00.590 --> 14:01.488
- YOUR TEENY, LITTLE EYE?

14:01.530 --> 14:04.146
- SOMETHING THAT IS BLACK,
AND WHITE--

14:04.180 --> 14:07.149
- WHO WANTS TO GO TO VEGAS?
- AND READ ALL OVER.

14:07.190 --> 14:08.452
- YOU NOTICING ANY DIFFERENCE?

14:08.500 --> 14:09.660
SEE HOW THE LIGHT
COMES UNDERNEATH THERE?

14:09.710 --> 14:11.393
YEAH.
- THEY BOTH LOOK REALLY GOOD.

14:11.430 --> 14:12.943
- YEAH, I JUST CAN'T--

14:12.990 --> 14:14.423
- HEY, DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

14:14.470 --> 14:16.631
- YEAH, YEAH, GO AHEAD.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.910
- 'CAUSE SOMETHING
HAPPENED WITH RUBY TODAY.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.439
- THIS ONE'S PRETTY GOOD TOO.
- MM-HMM.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.471
- AND THIS ONE--
THERE'S NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE.

14:22.510 --> 14:26.162
- DO YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT LATER?

14:26.210 --> 14:27.234
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.679
DOING IT AGAIN.
I'M DOING IT AGAIN.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.039
I'M NOT PAYING ATTENTION.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.276
ALL RIGHT,
I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU.

14:31.310 --> 14:33.244
- NO, NO, NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.
- AW, MAN, YOU LOOK PRETTY.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.202
I LIKE THE WHOLE THING.
- THANKS.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.286
- YEAH.
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:37.320 --> 14:38.969
- WE JUST HAD A FUNNY--

14:39.010 --> 14:41.149
- RUBY SAID YOU HAD FUN,
BY THE WAY. YEAH.

14:41.190 --> 14:42.384
- DID SHE REALLY?

14:42.430 --> 14:44.284
- WELL SHE DIDN'T, I MEAN,
SHE DIDN'T COME OUT AND SAY IT.

14:44.330 --> 14:45.490
- RIGHT.
- BUT SHE DIDN'T--

14:45.530 --> 14:48.988
SHE WOULD'VE
CAME IN REALLY COMPLAINING AND--

14:49.020 --> 14:50.157
IF SOMETHING WENT BAD,

14:50.190 --> 14:51.464
SO I THINK YOU GUYS--
- OH, I THINK YOU'RE BEING NICE.

14:51.510 --> 14:52.397
- I THINK YOU HIT IT OFF--NO, I
THINK SHE WOULD'VE COMPLAINED.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.158
- SHE'S DEFINITELY
IN A DIFFERENT PLACE

14:54.200 --> 14:56.020
THAN WHEN I SAW HER LAST,

14:56.060 --> 14:57.231
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S BEING A TEENAGER,

14:57.270 --> 14:59.067
OR THE FACT
THAT WE'RE TOGETHER, OR--

14:59.100 --> 15:02.024
- YEAH, WELL, SHE'S--
- AND THAT'S FINE, BUT SHE--

15:02.070 --> 15:03.924
- YEAH, SHE'S AT THAT AGE.
- SHE TOOK A LIPSTICK

15:03.970 --> 15:09.203
AND JUST PUT IT IN HER BAG
AND DIDN'T PAY FOR IT.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.309
- SHE, LIKE--SHOPLIFT?

15:11.350 --> 15:12.419
- YEAH.

15:12.460 --> 15:14.178
- NO.

15:14.220 --> 15:15.528
SHE DOESN'T SHOPLIFT.

15:15.560 --> 15:16.629
RUBY DOESN'T SHOPLIFT.

15:16.670 --> 15:18.183
- NO, SHE DID TODAY.

15:18.220 --> 15:19.289
AND I ASKED HER ABOUT IT,

15:19.330 --> 15:22.117
AND SHE JUST SHRUGGED IT OFF,
WALKED AWAY, AND--

15:22.160 --> 15:23.604
- ARE YOU SURE YOU SAW IT RIGHT?

15:23.640 --> 15:26.222
I MEAN, YOU MIGHT HAVE
MADE A MISTAKE, MAYBE,

15:26.270 --> 15:27.191
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK
SHE DOES THAT.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.674
- NO, HON.
- SHE'S NEVER DONE THAT WITH ME.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.359
I MEAN, I DON'T--

15:31.410 --> 15:36.131
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:36.170 --> 15:37.091
WHAT DO I DO?

15:37.140 --> 15:40.234
I DON'T, UH...

15:40.280 --> 15:42.692
OH, GOD.

15:42.730 --> 15:44.243
I SUCK AT THIS, YOU KNOW?

15:44.280 --> 15:47.101
I SUCK AT BEING A PARENT.

15:47.150 --> 15:51.689
- DESERT, THIRSTY

15:51.740 --> 15:55.289
THE LIGHTS ARE OFF

15:55.330 --> 15:58.493
HABIT, MERCY--

15:58.540 --> 16:02.431
- HEY, YOU OKAY?

16:02.470 --> 16:04.097
- YEAH,

16:04.130 --> 16:07.577
I COULDN'T SLEEP.
I WAS LOOKING AT THIS.

16:07.620 --> 16:09.099
- WHAT IS THAT?

16:09.140 --> 16:10.641
WORST-CASE SCENARIO,
WHAT'S THAT?

16:10.690 --> 16:14.649
- ADAM'S IN A...
NEGATIVITY VORTEX,

16:14.690 --> 16:16.487
AND HE PUT TOGETHER THIS EMAIL
TO SCARE THE CRAP

16:16.520 --> 16:18.340
OUT OF EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY,

16:18.390 --> 16:20.597
WHICH IS NOW STARTING TO WORK.

16:20.630 --> 16:22.359
- HE'S JUST SCARED, BABY.

16:22.390 --> 16:25.188
THAT'S HOW HE DEALS WITH IT.

16:25.220 --> 16:27.666
UM...
IT'S A BIG DEAL, YOU KNOW?

16:27.710 --> 16:29.359
YOUR DAD'S HAVING HEART SURGERY.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.221
IT'S OKAY TO BE SCARED.

16:32.260 --> 16:37.050
- DOWN WITH A WEIGHT
ON YOUR BETTER SIDE--

16:37.090 --> 16:38.671
- I'M NOT GONNA JOIN HIM.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.745
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN, SO--

16:40.790 --> 16:43.338
I REFUSE TO GO DOWN THIS PATH
WITH HIM.

16:56.150 --> 16:58.141
- HI.

16:58.180 --> 17:02.731
- HI. SORRY, I THOUGHT
I HAD THIS TIMED BETTER, UM--

17:02.780 --> 17:04.395
- HOW IS HE?

17:04.430 --> 17:06.182
- HE'S GOOD.
HE'S GOOD, ACTUALLY.

17:06.230 --> 17:09.290
YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT--

17:09.330 --> 17:10.501
WE JUST STUCK TO BASEBALL,

17:10.540 --> 17:12.679
MOSTLY.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.267
- RIGHT. THE BIG A'S GAME TODAY.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.471
- BIG A'S GAME, YEAH.

17:15.510 --> 17:16.613
HE'S CONVINCED
WE'RE GOING TO THE SERIES,

17:16.650 --> 17:18.709
WHICH I'M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT,

17:18.760 --> 17:22.514
BUT I HUMORED HIM, SO--

17:22.550 --> 17:25.553
ANYWAY, I BETTER GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE EVERYONE GETS HERE, SO--

17:25.590 --> 17:27.797
- ALL RIGHT.

17:27.830 --> 17:31.072
- HEY, JULES?

17:31.110 --> 17:34.147
YOUR DAD'S GONNA BE FINE,

18:17.260 --> 18:19.194
YOU KNOW,
MOM DIDN'T DO SO WELL, THOUGH.

18:19.230 --> 18:22.267
- MOM DIDN'T DO SO WELL
BECAUSE I WAS SLEEPING ON A COT.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.710

18:23.750 --> 18:25.718
I'M NOT NERVOUS AT ALL.

IF YOU'RE GETTING GOOD NEWS,
THEY TELL YOU OUT HERE.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.507
IF YOU GET BAD NEWS, THEY
TAKE YOU TO THE BAD NEWS ROOM

HIS HEART OPERATED ON?

26:52.740 --> 26:53.946
WE'RE GONNA GET SUED

AND I'LL STAY HERE AND BE
INVALUABLE TO THIS FAMILY.

26:56.510 --> 26:57.886

27:44.380 --> 27:46.109
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO COUNT ON ME,

27:46.140 --> 27:48.483
AND THIS LITTLE BABY'S GONNA
COUNT ON ME, AND I'M GONNA BE--

27:48.520 --> 27:52.388
I'M GONNA BE THE MOST
AMAZING DAD YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.832
AND YOU'RE NOT DOING
THIS ALONE.

27:54.880 --> 27:57.451
OKAY?
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

27:57.500 --> 28:01.732
I'M GONNA BE WITH YOU
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

28:16.240 --> 28:19.368
_ 50--
HOW'D IT GO?

28:19.420 --> 28:23.959
- I'M NOT FIVE, MOM.
IT WAS FINE.

28:26.110 --> 28:29.455
- SOMETHING DID COME UP, THOUGH,
MAYBE--MIGHT'VE HAPPENED.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.321
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT MIGHT HAVE COME UP?

28:32.360 --> 28:33.349
- I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.

28:33.400 --> 28:36.221
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE RUBY.

28:36.260 --> 28:38.057
SARAH, YOU KNOW,
SHE MIGHT'VE SAW WRONG.

28:38.090 --> 28:39.296
I WASN'T THERE, SO--AT ALL.

28:39.330 --> 28:43.050
- WHOA, WAIT,
WHY WAS SHE WITH SARAH ALONE?

28:43.100 --> 28:45.500
- SHE WAS--WELL, THEY WENT OUT,
'CAUSE I WAS WORKING.

28:45.550 --> 28:47.814
- OH, OH, OKAY,

28:47.860 --> 28:50.067
SO THEN YOU DECIDED TO PAWN
HER OFF ON YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

28:50.100 --> 28:51.510
- I DIDN'T PAWN ANYBODY OFF,
OKAY.

28:51.550 --> 28:53.927
I WAS JUST--THEY'RE GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

28:53.970 --> 28:56.279
SARAH SAYS THAT'S IMPORTANT.
- OKAY, THAT'S GREAT.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.459
SARAH THINKS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
SHE GET TO KNOW OUR DAUGHTER,

28:58.490 --> 29:01.414
WHEREAS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT YOU DO.

29:01.460 --> 29:03.553
- OKAY, THIS IS ALL COMING
OFF THE RAILS HERE, ALL RIGHT?

29:03.600 --> 29:05.318
AND NOTHING PROBABLY HAPPENED.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.520
SARAH PROBABLY SAW IT ALL WRONG.

29:06.570 --> 29:10.324
- OKAY, JUST, LIKE, WHAT DID
SARAH THINK THAT SHE SAW?

29:10.360 --> 29:13.329
- RUBY MIGHT HAVE TRIED
TO STEAL SOME LIPSTICK,

29:13.370 --> 29:14.462
BUT THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE HER, RIGHT?

29:14.510 --> 29:16.023
SO--
- CRAP.

29:16.060 --> 29:17.368
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
I THOUGHT, HEY,

29:17.410 --> 29:18.957
IT PROBABLY DIDN'T HAPPEN,
BUT I JUST THOUGHT--

29:18.990 --> 29:21.402
- SHE IS--
SHE IS OUT OF CONTROL,

29:21.440 --> 29:23.408
AND IF SHE DOESN'T STOP,
I JUST--

29:23.450 --> 29:25.338
I DON'T KNO\I/V WEEAT HAPPENED.

29:25.380 --> 29:27.848
- WAIT, SO WHAT,
SHE'S STOLEN BEFORE?

29:27.900 --> 29:30.277
- WHAT PART OF OUR DAUGHTER
BEING IN DISTRESS

29:30.320 --> 29:32.174
DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?
- OKAY--

29:32.210 --> 29:33.859
_ THIS IS WHY I MOVED BACK HERE,
HANK.

29:33.910 --> 29:35.411
- SHE STEALS NOW.
- SHE'S AT A CROSSROADS.

29:35.460 --> 29:36.973
THE STEALING,
THE TALKING BACK,

29:37.010 --> 29:38.420
THE SNEAKING OUT,
THIS IS HER WAY--

29:38.460 --> 29:40.041
- AND NOW SNEAKS--
SHE SNEAKS OUT TOO?

29:40.080 --> 29:42.799
- SHE NEEDS A FATHER!

29:45.640 --> 29:46.868
- I KNOW THAT.
- DO YOU?

29:46.920 --> 29:48.251
BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU DID,

29:48.300 --> 29:50.439
THEN SHE WOULD'VE BEEN
WITH YOU AND NOT THE WOMAN

29:50.470 --> 29:52.335
THAT YOU ARE SLEEPING WITH.

29:52.370 --> 29:54.474
LISTEN, I JUST--

29:54.510 --> 29:56.125
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE JUST--
YOU'RE NOT GETTING THIS,

29:56.170 --> 29:57.819
SO I'M JUST GONNA
LAY DOWN THE LAW HERE.

29:57.860 --> 30:01.614
WHEN RUBY IS WITH YOU,
SHE IS WITH YOU, OKAY?

30:01.660 --> 30:03.378
I DON'T EVEN WANT
SARAH AROUND.

30:03.420 --> 30:07.834
DO WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER?
- YEAH, YEAH.

30:07.870 --> 30:09.451
- ALL RIGHT,
DON'T JUST NOD YOUR HEAD.

30:09.490 --> 30:11.105
I HATE IT WHEN YOU DO THAT,
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT

30:11.150 --> 30:13.243
REALLY HEARING ME.

30:13.290 --> 30:15.497
I NEED YOU TO SAY IT.
I NEED YOU TO SAY IT, HANK.

30:15.530 --> 30:17.395
I NEED YOU TO SAY IT OUT LOUD.

30:21.540 --> 30:24.395
- I'M TRYING, YOU KNOW?
I'M REALLY TRYING.

30:24.440 --> 30:29.161
- YEAH, WELL...
YOU'RE JUST GONNA

30:29.200 --> 30:33.091
HAVE TO TRY A LITTLE HARDER.

30:34.410 --> 30:38.369
[door opens, closes]

30:46.050 --> 30:47.358
- HEY.
- HEY.

30:47.390 --> 30:48.596
- THAT TOOK FOREVER.

30:48.630 --> 30:50.211
- SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO--
- THAT'S FINE, HOW'D IT GO?

30:50.260 --> 30:52.535
- LEAVE YOU WAITING.

30:52.570 --> 30:58.395
- IT WENT, LIKE, WEIRDLY GREAT.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.362
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

31:00.410 --> 31:02.332
- JUST, LIKE,
HE'S--I DON'T KNOW.

31:02.370 --> 31:04.577
HE WAS, LIKE, SO EXCITED

31:04.620 --> 31:06.952
AND HAPPY ABOUT IT,

31:07.000 --> 31:09.377
AND, YOU KNOW,
IT'S--I DON'T KNOW.

31:09.410 --> 31:11.446
IT'S CONFUSING FOR ME.
IT'S WEIRD BEING HERE.

31:11.490 --> 31:12.275
LIKE, SEEING HIM, AND--

31:12.310 --> 31:15.484
IT'S HARD
FOR ME TO SEE HIM AGAIN,

31:15.520 --> 31:17.408
AND--

31:17.460 --> 31:18.449
- YEAH, I MEAN, HE WAS--

31:18.490 --> 31:23.006
SEEMED LIKE HE WAS KIND
OF A MESS TO ME, I MEAN.

31:23.050 --> 31:24.449
- OH, I DON'T--

31:24.500 --> 31:25.660
I DON'T THINK IT WAS THAT BAD.

31:25.710 --> 31:27.940
- LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT IT
IN THE CAR, 'CAUSE WE HAVE,

31:27.980 --> 31:29.459
LIKE, 18 HOURS TO DRIVE.

31:29.500 --> 31:32.082
- I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THAT, JUST FOR A SECOND.

31:32.130 --> 31:35.122
DREW, I'M--I'M GONNA STAY
FOR A LITTLE BIT HERE.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.572
- THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I CAME.
YOU'RE NOT STAYING HERE.

31:37.610 --> 31:39.612
- OKAY, I AM STAYING HERE,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE STAY.

31:39.650 --> 31:41.026
I WANT YOU TO GO BACK,
AND I'LL BE BACK--

31:41.070 --> 31:42.298
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
AMBER, WHAT--

31:42.340 --> 31:44.991
- WHAT AM I THINKING? I'M HAVING
A BABY WITH THIS GUY, AND--

31:45.040 --> 31:46.439
- YOU'RE NOT HAVING A BABY
WITH HIM.

31:46.490 --> 31:47.411
YOU CAME HERE TO TELL HIM

31:47.450 --> 31:49.202
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HAVE IT WITH HIM.

31:49.250 --> 31:51.104
- YES, I AM. HE'S--I KNOW THAT,
BUT Al-TER TALKING TO HIM,

31:51.150 --> 31:53.414
I STILL NEED SOME--I NEED
TO FIGURE SOME THINGS OUT,

31:53.460 --> 31:56.281
AND HE'S THE FATHER OF MY CHILD.
I CAN'T JUST--

31:56.320 --> 31:57.594
- HE'S A MESS.

31:57.630 --> 31:59.450
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO DO?

31:59.500 --> 32:01.354
YOU COULDN'T EVEN MARRY HIM.
- DREW, THIS IS DIFFERENT.

32:01.400 --> 32:02.662
YOU'RE GONNA RAISE A BABY
WITH HIM NOW?

32:02.710 --> 32:03.495
YEAH, BECAUSE THIS IS DIFFERENT,

32:03.540 --> 32:04.984
HE WAS--
- NO, IT'S NOT DIFFERENT.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.328
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME.

32:06.370 --> 32:08.088
HE'S NOT GONNA CHANGE.
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

32:08.130 --> 32:11.679
- HE NEVER CHANGED.
IT'S LIKE DAD, YOU KNOW?

32:11.720 --> 32:13.472
HE'S JUST GONNA
SAY A BUNCH OF STUFF

32:13.510 --> 32:15.137
AND NOT LIVE UP TO IT,
WHICH HE--

32:15.170 --> 32:16.262
- IT'S NOT LIKE DAD.
IT'S NOT LIKE DAD.

32:16.310 --> 32:17.754
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.
- YES, IT IS.

32:17.790 --> 32:19.371
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME. YOU THINK
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIX HIM

32:19.420 --> 32:20.341
OR SOMETHING, NOW IT'S--
- WELL, I'M THINKING OF HIM.

32:20.380 --> 32:21.176
HE NEEDS ME RIGHT NOW,
AND TO HAVE HIM--

32:21.210 --> 32:22.131
- FIRST,
IT WAS, "GETTING TOGETHER

32:22.180 --> 32:24.068
OR GETTING MARRIED
IS GONNA CHANGE HIM."

32:24.110 --> 32:25.202
NOW,
IT'S, "OH, HAVING A BABY

32:25.250 --> 32:27.218
IS GONNA CHANGE HIM."
YOU'RE NOT GONNA CHANGE HIM.

32:27.250 --> 32:28.626
- DREW, I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP,
BECAUSE HE NEEDS--

32:28.670 --> 32:31.355
- YOU CAN'T--
NO, YOU CAN'T HELP HIM.

32:31.390 --> 32:33.426
THAT'S IT.
YOU CAN'T HELP.

32:33.460 --> 32:38.227
IF YOU WERE GOING TO HELP,
IT WOULD'VE ALREADY HAPPENED.

32:38.260 --> 32:40.148
- I'M SORRY THAT YOU--
THAT YOU FEEL THIS WAY,

32:40.190 --> 32:43.330
BUT I'M STAYING TO FIGURE
SOME THINGS OUT WITH HIM.

32:43.370 --> 32:46.055
- OKAY, WHY DON'T--I'M GONNA
LEAVE FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR,

32:46.100 --> 32:47.408
AND THEN I'M GONNA COME BACK.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.544
YOU CAN GO DEAL WITH IT,
BUT YOU'RE NOT STAYING HERE.

32:49.580 --> 32:51.684
I'LL BE BACK.

32:54.210 --> 32:56.440
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU
IN WYOMING.

32:56.490 --> 32:58.481
[engine starts]

33:08.670 --> 33:11.389
- OLIVER? LOOK, LISTEN,
DO NOT HANG UP ON ME.

33:11.430 --> 33:13.398
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
IN SANTA FE, MAN?

33:13.430 --> 33:16.263
WELL, YEAH,
WE ALL HAVE STUFF GOING ON.

33:16.300 --> 33:19.098
YOU GOTTA GET IN YOUR CAR RIGHT
NOW AND GET BACK TO ALBUQUERQUE.

33:19.130 --> 33:21.166
YOU GOTTA PLAY
THOSE PSEUDO-ALTERNATIVE SONGS

33:21.200 --> 33:23.373
IN FRONT OF THE TEENYBOPPERS,
MAN, YOU GOT A CONTRACT.

33:23.410 --> 33:24.445
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

33:24.480 --> 33:25.572
YEAH, YOU CAN'T JUST

33:25.620 --> 33:27.781
HAVE SOME WHIMSICAL,
CREATIVE BREAKDOWN RIGHT NOW.

33:27.830 --> 33:29.274
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DEALING WITH?

33:29.310 --> 33:30.345
YEAH, LIFE OR DEATH, MAN.

33:30.380 --> 33:33.247
GET IN YOUR--DON'T--
IF YOU HANG UP ON ME, I--

33:33.280 --> 33:36.454
NO, YOU GET IN THE CAR
AND GET TO THE SHOW, DO YOU--

33:36.490 --> 33:38.549
OLIVER!

33:38.600 --> 33:45.460
- RUN AWAY,
I'M A TRAVELLIN' MAN

33:45.500 --> 33:50.813
BEEN WALKING EVERY DAY

33:50.850 --> 33:56.641
I WATCH YOU AS YOU HESITATE

33:56.680 --> 34:02.368
WALKING THROUGH THE RAIN

34:02.410 --> 34:08.133
THAT JUST DON'T BEAT THE SAME
ANYMORE

34:08.180 --> 34:13.868
THAT MIGHT AS WELL BE GONE

34:13.910 --> 34:17.630
I'M AT
THE DARKENED HILL SIDE

34:17.670 --> 34:23.358
AND THERE'S A HAZE
RIGHT BETWEEN THE TREES

34:25.540 --> 34:29.124
AND I CAN BARELY SEE YOU

34:29.170 --> 34:35.131
YOU'RE LIKE AN OCEAN
BETWEEN THE WAVES

34:53.950 --> 34:56.111
-AHHnOH.

35:08.720 --> 35:13.339
[phone ringing]

35:13.380 --> 35:15.792
- HI, HOW ARE THE KIDS?
- OH, THEY'RE--THEY'RE GREAT.

35:15.830 --> 35:19.721
I WAS JUST CALLING TO SEE
IF THERE WAS AN UPDATE ON ZEEK.

35:19.770 --> 35:22.933
- UM, NO.
IT'S BEEN SIX HOURS, THOUGH,

35:22.980 --> 35:24.356
SO HOPEFULLY SOMETHING SOON.

35:24.390 --> 35:27.462
- OKAY.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.536
AND HOW ARE YOU?

35:29.570 --> 35:32.255
- I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.

35:32.300 --> 35:33.437
YOU KNOW, HANGING IN THERE.

35:33.470 --> 35:35.199
- YEAH?

35:35.230 --> 35:38.199
YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY
IF YOU'RE NOT.

35:38.230 --> 35:39.857
- I'M FINE, REALLY.
- JULES,

35:39.890 --> 35:43.371
I CAN HEAR IT IN YOUR VOICE.
YOU NEED TO GET OUTSIDE?

35:43.410 --> 35:45.753
YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO CRY IN FRONT OF YOUR MOM,

35:45.790 --> 35:48.350
BUT IT--YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED
TO--I'D BE HAPPY TO MEET YOU

35:48.380 --> 35:53.272
SOMEWHERE IF YOU JUST NEED
TO TALK OR WHATEVER.

35:53.320 --> 35:56.596
- JOEL, IT'S TOO HARD.
- WHAT?

35:56.630 --> 36:01.215
- JUST YOU ASKING ME HOW I AM
AND WANTING TO BE THERE FOR ME,

36:01.260 --> 36:03.353
AND--

36:03.400 --> 36:04.981
IT'S CONFUSING.

36:05.020 --> 36:09.263
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I CARE ABOUT YOU, AND...

36:09.300 --> 36:11.814
AND I CARE ABOUT
THE FAMILY,

36:11.850 --> 36:13.294
AND, YOU KNOW,
I JUST WANTED TO--

36:13.340 --> 36:17.162
- JOEL, UM...

36:19.310 --> 36:20.959
I'M SEEING SOMEONE.

36:32.740 --> 36:36.699
- UH, YEAH--

36:36.740 --> 36:39.561
YEAH, SO I WAS JUST
CALLING TO SEE IF ZEEK WAS OKAY,

36:39.610 --> 36:43.319
AND--YEAH, WE'LL TALK LATER.

36:43.370 --> 36:45.361
OKAY, BYE.

36:58.310 --> 37:00.244
- HEY.
- HEY.

37:10.330 --> 37:13.322
HOW'D IT GO OUT THERE?

37:13.360 --> 37:15.328
- OKAY.

37:17.090 --> 37:19.957
UM--

37:19.990 --> 37:23.926
I JUST HAVE TO ASK, LIKE,
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU,

37:23.960 --> 37:26.542
AND, LIKE, THE PILL STUFF.

37:26.580 --> 37:31.062
- I KNOW. IT'S TIME. I'VE BEEN--
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO.

37:31.110 --> 37:34.386
I'M GONNA CALL THE VA AND SET
AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DOCTOR

37:34.420 --> 37:35.512
AND GET THEM TO WEAN ME OFF--

37:35.560 --> 37:38.791
YOU KNOW, HELP ME,
WEAN MYSELF OFF IT.

37:43.500 --> 37:46.628
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I WILL ALWAYS WANT

37:46.670 --> 37:48.046
YOU TO BE IN THIS BABY'S LIFE.

37:48.090 --> 37:52.368
- I'M GOING TO. I'M GOING TO BE.
- I KNOW, BUT--OKAY.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.982
- I'M GONNA BE YOUR TEAMMATE
IN THIS,

37:55.030 --> 37:57.294
AND I'M GONNA BE A FATHER
TO THAT CHILD.

37:57.340 --> 38:00.309
EVERYTHING CHANGED THE MINUTE
YOU CAME HERE TODAY. EVERYTHING.

38:00.340 --> 38:03.719
- RYAN...

38:03.760 --> 38:06.308
I BELIEVE IN YOU

38:06.350 --> 38:09.319
JUST LIKE I'VE ALWAYS
BELIEVED IN YOU--

38:09.350 --> 38:10.510
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

38:10.560 --> 38:15.315
- BUT YOU HAVE
A LOT OF WORK TO DO,

38:15.360 --> 38:20.320
AND I CAN'T DO IT WITH YOU,

38:20.360 --> 38:23.329
BECAUSE I HAVE TO START
TAKING CARE OF MYSELF

38:23.370 --> 38:27.329
AND OF THIS BABY, RIGHT NOW,

38:27.370 --> 38:29.577
AND I'M SORRY, BUT YOU'RE
JUST NOT READY YET.

38:32.650 --> 38:35.926
- WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW

38:35.960 --> 38:40.101
THAT YOU WERE PREGNANT
UNTIL TODAY.

38:40.140 --> 38:42.313
- I KNOW.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.824
- HEY.
- STILL NOTHING?

39:10.860 --> 39:13.033
- NO.
- WOW.

39:13.070 --> 39:16.619
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
I CALLED YOU, LIKE, FIVE TIMES?

39:16.660 --> 39:17.558
- I COULDN'T GET A-HOLD
OF OLIVER,

39:17.590 --> 39:20.172
AND THEN I FOUGHT WITH HIM
FOR A WHILE,

39:20.210 --> 39:21.381
AND THEN I TRIED
TO CALL HIM BACK.

39:21.420 --> 39:22.102
THERE'S NO UPDATES?

39:22.150 --> 39:24.527
- NO.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.155
- SURGERY WENT WELL.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.714
HE'S RECOVERING IN THE ICU NOW.

39:39.750 --> 39:42.685
YOU CAN ALL GO VISIT HIM,
BUT JUST FOR A MINUTE, OKAY?

39:42.720 --> 39:44.096
- SO IT'S--IT'S ALL OVER.

39:44.140 --> 39:47.439
- THERE WERE NO COMPLICATIONS
WITH THE BYPASS

39:47.480 --> 39:48.799
OR THE VALVE REPLACEMENT,

39:48.830 --> 39:52.129
SO WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE
HOW HE RESPONDS.

39:52.180 --> 39:54.557
HOPEFULLY HIS HEART MUSCLE
WILL GET STRONGER.

39:54.590 --> 39:57.036
CAMILLE, PLEASE DON'T WORRY.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.934
I'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU TOMORROW.

39:58.980 --> 40:01.073
OH, ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
- THANK YOU.

40:01.120 --> 40:05.011
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- GOOD WORK.

40:05.050 --> 40:07.769
- EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.
- LET'S GO SEE HIM.

40:07.810 --> 40:09.129
- I COULD'VE DEALT WITH THAT
A LOT BETTER.

40:09.160 --> 40:11.913
- SORRY, IT'S MY FAULT.
YOU ALL RIGHT?

40:11.960 --> 40:12.881
- MM-HMM.
- YOU SURE?

40:12.920 --> 40:16.048
- I JUST TWEAKED SOMETHING
RIDING, I THINK.

40:19.240 --> 40:24.758
- I FEEL SO LIGHT AND I MOVE
LIKE A BIRD

40:24.800 --> 40:30.761
HARD AS A ROSE
SHARP AS A WORD

40:35.220 --> 40:40.465
I'M HAPPY

40:40.500 --> 40:45.153
HERE SHE COMES

40:45.200 --> 40:51.161
THERE WE GO

41:03.660 --> 41:09.212
WHEN I DIE
WHERE I GO?

41:09.250 --> 41:14.734
I DON'T KNOW
THROUGH THE SKY MAYBE DOWN LOW

41:14.780 --> 41:19.194
WHICH EVER

41:19.230 --> 41:23.473
IS FOR REAL

41:30.030 --> 41:36.003
OH YEAH

41:49.120 --> 41:54.740
AND I NEVER HIT THE SPRING SO
HARD

41:54.780 --> 41:59.058
A NEW BORN SONG
ON AN OLD GUITAR

41:59.100 --> 42:03.207
AND I KNOW

42:03.240 --> 42:08.303
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ALIVE
