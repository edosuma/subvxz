WEBVTT

00:06.453 --> 00:08.114
Hey, Bull.

00:08.288 --> 00:09.550
Why so glum?

00:09.723 --> 00:12.385
Oh, first it was Grenada
and then Lebanon.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.125
Yeah, I know what you mean.

00:15.362 --> 00:20.265
Seems like every time I start to get close
to a girl, she gets shipped out.

00:22.535 --> 00:25.936
Well, maybe this next case
will cheer him up.

00:31.311 --> 00:34.178
Settle down! Thank you.

00:34.814 --> 00:36.611
- Your Honor...
- You know, sometimes...

00:36.783 --> 00:39.445
...this is a great job.

00:40.220 --> 00:41.482
Yeah, Your Honor...

00:41.654 --> 00:45.317
Let me guess. This guy was caught
peeping into their dressing room.

00:45.492 --> 00:48.393
He's the victim, Your Honor.
The ladies are the defendants.

00:48.561 --> 00:51.997
Do you mean to tell me these sweet,
innocent-looking young women...

00:52.165 --> 00:54.725
Beat the snot out of this man. Right.

00:57.003 --> 00:59.904
Your Honor, my clients
were lured to New York...

01:00.073 --> 01:02.337
...under the guise of a legitimate
beauty contest.

01:02.509 --> 01:06.468
It turned out that Mr. Harris here did not
have the prize money he claimed to have.

01:06.646 --> 01:11.208
The girls found out during the competition
and they responded.

01:12.352 --> 01:15.617
Your Honor, according to witnesses,
Miss Congeniality led the attack...

01:15.789 --> 01:17.950
...with a kick to the groin.

01:18.224 --> 01:21.159
The one in the polka suit over there
tried to twist my lips off.

01:23.163 --> 01:24.824
- I beg your pardon.
- All right!

01:24.998 --> 01:26.727
That will be enough of that language.

01:29.069 --> 01:31.037
I mean the bickering, not the Swedish.

01:31.204 --> 01:33.570
Your Honor, it's not only Swedish,
but Italian...

01:33.740 --> 01:36.368
...Japanese, Spanish and Arabic.

01:36.543 --> 01:38.977
Weren't there any interpreters
at the pageant?

01:39.145 --> 01:41.739
All his budget allowed for was
one videotape machine...

01:41.915 --> 01:45.214
...and a dresser named Vito.

01:46.486 --> 01:49.047
Hey, come on. This is for cable TV.

01:49.223 --> 01:52.249
I ain't got bucks to throw around
like those network productions.

01:52.426 --> 01:53.688
I could do a whole show...

01:53.861 --> 01:57.456
...for what one of those
Barbara Mandrell outfits go for.

01:57.832 --> 01:59.424
You are a resourceful man...

01:59.600 --> 02:02.763
...but evidently your profit comes
at some expense to others.

02:02.937 --> 02:04.199
Your Honor...

02:04.371 --> 02:07.738
...the fact is that this man is not the one
who is on trial here...

02:07.908 --> 02:12.971
...although the people will agree his actions
were scum-like in nature.

02:13.147 --> 02:17.447
He twisted these girls' innocent
hopes and dreams into...

02:17.618 --> 02:20.985
...grotesque nightmares of horror.

02:21.155 --> 02:24.215
- You're on my side, right?
- Yeah. Don't worry.

02:24.625 --> 02:27.219
Your Honor, I would like
a continuance of this case...

02:27.394 --> 02:30.852
...until interpreters can be found
and these ladies are provided for.

02:31.031 --> 02:34.432
- Mr. Prosecutor?
- Absolutely.

02:35.136 --> 02:36.728
Then it is so ordered.

02:38.139 --> 02:40.403
Your Honor, being a speaker of English...

02:40.641 --> 02:42.939
...I can make my statement now
if it would help.

02:43.110 --> 02:46.705
I like to help. That's why
I'm majoring in speech therapy.

02:46.881 --> 02:49.475
It's a way to help those less
fortunate than ourselves...

02:49.650 --> 02:53.245
...learn the ability to communicate
and function as productive human beings...

02:53.420 --> 02:55.081
...in our society.

02:55.656 --> 02:59.615
I've got some paper bags in the office
if you feel the need to:

03:00.261 --> 03:02.957
I just love our system of justice,
Your Honor.

03:03.130 --> 03:08.124
That system works for me,
and by golly, I'll work for it.

03:08.769 --> 03:10.600
Baton twirler, right?

03:10.771 --> 03:13.467
Yes! How did you know?

03:13.641 --> 03:16.303
- Lucky guess.
- Oh, thank you.

03:24.185 --> 03:28.383
Can you say "Dan"?

03:29.890 --> 03:31.118
Next case, Your Honor.

03:31.292 --> 03:33.089
<i>People v. Eleanor Brandon...</i>

03:33.260 --> 03:35.524
...malicious mischief, Class C.

03:35.696 --> 03:37.857
- Malicious mischief?
- I chucked a rock...

03:38.032 --> 03:39.795
...through a plate-glass window.

03:40.201 --> 03:41.498
Well, so you did.

03:41.669 --> 03:44.695
Barton Jewelry Store was
the offended establishment, Your Honor.

03:45.239 --> 03:48.697
- Ms. Brandon, do you have anything to say?
- Yes.

03:48.876 --> 03:52.175
You're even better-looking
than I imagined.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.906
I'll get those paper bags now.

03:56.483 --> 03:58.417
When Harry was 4...

03:58.586 --> 04:01.817
...his hair was dark
like his Uncle Otto.

04:02.223 --> 04:04.919
Who would think it would have
lightened up so much?

04:05.092 --> 04:08.152
Yes. Goes nicely with the robe.

04:08.963 --> 04:10.487
You know my Uncle Otto?

04:10.664 --> 04:13.098
- Of course.
- Then I take it we have met?

04:13.267 --> 04:14.825
A long time ago.

04:15.002 --> 04:18.459
I'm afraid you have the advantage,
Miss Brandon. I just don't remember you.

04:19.206 --> 04:21.106
Well, how could you?

04:21.274 --> 04:25.041
The last time I saw you,
you were only 5.

04:25.279 --> 04:27.144
Miss Brandon.

04:27.581 --> 04:28.809
Harry.

04:29.817 --> 04:31.944
I'm your mother.

04:33.787 --> 04:35.448
Oh.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.619
Pleased to meet you.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:25.774 --> 05:27.036
- Harry.
- Did you catch...

05:27.208 --> 05:28.869
<i>... The Merv Griffin Show last night?</i>

05:29.044 --> 05:31.945
- He had this talking bird on...
- Harry!

05:32.113 --> 05:35.139
- What?
- That woman out there.

05:35.317 --> 05:36.784
Could she really be your mother?

05:37.819 --> 05:39.446
I don't know.

05:39.621 --> 05:41.020
You don't know?

05:41.189 --> 05:43.623
My mom walked out on me
when I was 5.

05:43.792 --> 05:47.956
Dad never talked about her and frankly, after
he died, I never thought much about her.

05:48.129 --> 05:50.654
- Anyway, the bird says to Merv...
- Harry!

05:52.200 --> 05:55.192
You mean, you never thought
about where your mother was...

05:55.370 --> 05:57.998
...what she was doing, whether she was
dead or alive?

05:58.173 --> 05:59.868
Honestly, I never thought about it.

06:00.041 --> 06:02.100
I mean, when I was
a kid growing up...

06:02.277 --> 06:05.474
...Mother's Day didn't mean anything more
to me than Groundhog's Day.

06:06.848 --> 06:09.282
Never had one of those, either.

06:10.118 --> 06:12.279
Your Honor, can I use
some of the petty cash...

06:12.454 --> 06:14.888
...to buy food for those bathing beauties?

06:15.056 --> 06:18.048
- Sure. How are they getting along?
- Well, as far as I can tell...

06:18.226 --> 06:20.194
...on looks alone.

06:22.263 --> 06:25.289
I just hope they know that at 30...

06:25.467 --> 06:27.992
...the party's over.

06:34.542 --> 06:37.705
This is Houston Street.

06:39.814 --> 06:41.873
Here's Third.

06:43.218 --> 06:48.656
And this is Dan's apartment.

06:49.290 --> 06:53.556
"Dan's apartment."

06:53.728 --> 06:55.719
Yes! Dan's apartment.

06:55.897 --> 07:00.664
Dan's apartment is good.

07:01.503 --> 07:04.131
"Good."

07:04.305 --> 07:05.829
Good.

07:16.151 --> 07:17.550
Hello.

07:18.486 --> 07:20.351
I like your dress.

07:23.124 --> 07:25.319
My name's Bull.

07:25.627 --> 07:28.892
Bull. You know, like the animal?

07:31.833 --> 07:34.324
Bull. Like this.

07:42.877 --> 07:45.675
No, no, no. Not a cow.

07:46.714 --> 07:48.147
Bull.

07:56.658 --> 08:00.321
- You've got to talk to her. That's a given.
- How does this look?

08:00.495 --> 08:03.055
I admit that it's possible
that she's not your mother...

08:03.231 --> 08:05.256
...but what if she is?

08:05.433 --> 08:08.027
It would look better if they
were lighted, wouldn't it?

08:08.536 --> 08:12.028
I understand you're diverting yourself.
I mean, it's very hard to handle...

08:12.207 --> 08:14.767
...and you're emotionally upset.

08:14.943 --> 08:16.706
- I'm not upset.
- Oh, yes, you are.

08:16.878 --> 08:19.574
- I am not upset!
- Why don't I make you a nice cup of tea...

08:19.747 --> 08:22.272
...to calm you down?
- I don't want any tea.

08:22.450 --> 08:25.351
- I've got your favorite, cherry Kool-Aid!
- Lana!

08:26.855 --> 08:28.516
Okay, okay.

08:28.990 --> 08:33.394
Maybe you're right. I mean, some woman
waltzes in here with strange claims.

08:33.562 --> 08:37.054
I mean, that's no reason for us to jump
to any definite conclusions.

08:38.701 --> 08:40.532
Hi, Mom.

08:41.570 --> 08:45.370
Your Honor? My client would like to have
a few minutes with you, if possible.

08:45.541 --> 08:47.805
Sure. Come on in. The more the merrier.

08:47.977 --> 08:50.673
Well, if you'll all excuse me...

08:50.846 --> 08:52.939
...l've got things to...

08:53.115 --> 08:54.810
...collate.

08:56.752 --> 08:58.515
Your Honor.

09:00.256 --> 09:04.886
I know I haven't been here for very long,
and sometimes I...

09:05.060 --> 09:09.190
Well, sometimes I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

09:09.532 --> 09:13.832
I'd like to pass on some advice
that my Uncle Lionel used to give me:

09:14.003 --> 09:16.369
Talk with your head...

09:16.772 --> 09:19.206
...but listen with your heart.

09:19.675 --> 09:22.735
- He sounds like a wise man.
- Yeah.

09:22.912 --> 09:26.040
We have no idea why he killed himself.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.914
Miss Brandon, have a seat.

09:34.256 --> 09:36.349
Thanks, Harry.

09:38.527 --> 09:40.222
So...

09:41.263 --> 09:44.096
- I know what you're thinking.
- No, I don't think you do.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.437
Well...

09:51.140 --> 09:53.768
...here it is in a nutshell:

09:53.943 --> 09:56.275
When I had you, I was young.

09:56.445 --> 09:58.208
Very young.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.473
I couldn't handle it.
I wasn't ready for it.

10:00.649 --> 10:02.446
I couldn't handle anything then.

10:02.618 --> 10:05.086
- Miss Brandon...
- What I'm trying to say is...

10:05.254 --> 10:08.781
...I wasn't well. Emotionally, that is.

10:08.958 --> 10:10.516
I mean, let's face it.

10:10.693 --> 10:15.062
Anybody who would leave their child
can't be emotionally well, can she?

10:15.230 --> 10:18.165
Miss Brandon, you're upset,
and maybe you're a little mixed-up.

10:18.334 --> 10:21.826
All you've done is broken a window.
It's not that serious.

10:23.005 --> 10:26.497
When you were little,
you had a little red wagon.

10:26.675 --> 10:30.111
Miss Brandon, lots of little boys
had little red wagons.

10:30.279 --> 10:33.806
And you used to take your dog Oliver
for rides in it.

10:34.883 --> 10:37.545
- That's true.
- Oh, you loved animals then.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.244
Do you still love animals?

10:39.421 --> 10:43.323
<i>Yeah. In fact, there was this bird
on The Merv Griffin Show...</i>

10:44.526 --> 10:46.721
Oh, I don't want anything, Harry.

10:46.895 --> 10:49.159
I don't want anything from you.

10:49.331 --> 10:52.596
I just came here to tell you...

10:52.768 --> 10:55.635
...that your mother loves you.

10:59.508 --> 11:03.000
Well, I've taken up enough of your time.

11:05.481 --> 11:07.346
Miss Brandon.

11:07.950 --> 11:11.613
Uncle Otto. How many thumbs
did he have?

11:15.124 --> 11:16.557
Let's talk.

11:24.233 --> 11:27.930
And it's shaped like a little star.

11:30.539 --> 11:32.803
I bet Harry could just die!

11:32.975 --> 11:37.071
I mean, what an embarrassing place
for a man to have a birthmark.

11:37.446 --> 11:40.711
- Have you seen it?
- Why, no.

11:47.690 --> 11:52.355
Now, just give this piece of paper
to the cabby.

11:53.263 --> 11:56.892
And tell him to take you there.

11:57.934 --> 12:01.961
I assure you there will be
no funny business...

12:02.138 --> 12:04.106
...if you don't want any.

12:05.108 --> 12:07.303
Now, this is just an offer to help you...

12:07.477 --> 12:09.468
...until you can get back home.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.114
Perhaps if we think of it
merely as a testimony...

12:12.282 --> 12:16.685
...to the spirit of easing international...

12:16.853 --> 12:19.048
...tensions.

12:19.222 --> 12:22.680
Our own little Olympic games.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.132
Hi.

12:30.767 --> 12:35.932
Story here about a man who ate
nothing but seaweed for three years.

12:36.372 --> 12:39.341
- Crazy, huh?
- Yeah. You got any chocolate cigarettes?

12:41.811 --> 12:43.904
I'll check.

12:46.116 --> 12:48.277
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:48.451 --> 12:51.215
- So how did it go with your...
- Mother?

12:51.855 --> 12:55.416
- Whatever.
- Well, she seems to know a lot about me.

12:55.792 --> 13:00.286
I've got this blurry 30-year-old photograph.
Could be her.

13:01.664 --> 13:04.394
Could be Red Buttons too.

13:04.934 --> 13:09.337
Yeah. Then I made a few phone calls,
and some things do fit.

13:09.672 --> 13:12.573
So you think it's a possibility?

13:12.742 --> 13:14.676
There are more things
in heaven and earth...

13:14.844 --> 13:16.869
Except chocolate cigarettes.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.911
- We're out.
- Darn.

13:19.616 --> 13:23.382
Can I show you something
in a bubble-gum cigar?

13:29.592 --> 13:31.992
I love "Dear Abby," don't you?

13:33.863 --> 13:35.831
Who doesn't?

13:37.400 --> 13:41.131
Dan Fielding, assistant district attorney.

13:41.504 --> 13:44.098
I'm Barbara, but my friends
call me Buffy.

13:44.274 --> 13:46.708
Get it? Barbara, Buffy?

13:47.210 --> 13:49.201
Yeah.

13:49.879 --> 13:51.710
I get it.

13:52.348 --> 13:55.078
- Do you have a nickname?
- I'm afraid not.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.014
- Well, then let's give you one.
- Hey.

13:57.187 --> 13:59.417
Let's see. Dan Fielding.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.523
How about...

14:01.691 --> 14:03.750
...Dino!
- I like it.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.552
I really do.

14:05.995 --> 14:08.930
But just for tonight.

14:11.634 --> 14:15.832
- Can anyone sit here?
- Sure. Join us.

14:16.873 --> 14:19.899
I mean, I have to be
running along myself...

14:20.076 --> 14:22.203
...but sit down.

14:22.412 --> 14:24.744
Selma, don't you have to go too?

14:24.981 --> 14:26.471
No.

14:27.917 --> 14:29.646
But what do I know?

14:30.019 --> 14:31.646
See you.

14:35.825 --> 14:37.918
Those people really like you.

14:38.094 --> 14:39.322
I like them too.

14:39.495 --> 14:42.293
Oh, Liz told me about the store owner...

14:42.465 --> 14:45.059
...dropping the charges
if I offer to pay for the window.

14:45.235 --> 14:47.601
- Have you got the money?
- I got the money. Thanks.

14:47.770 --> 14:49.465
Good.

14:51.140 --> 14:55.099
Well, I better be going.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.072
You take care.

14:59.249 --> 15:01.274
It was very nice to see you, Harry.

15:01.851 --> 15:03.648
Bye.

15:04.787 --> 15:06.550
Eleanor?

15:12.196 --> 15:16.132
Maybe... Maybe you wanna hang around
for a while and watch the session.

15:16.300 --> 15:21.670
And then afterwards, we could go out
and have a drink or some coffee...

15:21.839 --> 15:23.864
...you know, and talk.

15:24.041 --> 15:27.738
Oh, yeah, sure. I'd like that.
I love to talk.

15:27.912 --> 15:30.278
- Yeah, me too.
- It runs in the family.

15:31.649 --> 15:33.344
Yeah.

15:34.985 --> 15:37.977
Having listened to the testimony
and read the statements...

15:38.155 --> 15:41.318
...the court finds the defendants
not guilty.

15:42.593 --> 15:44.060
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

15:44.228 --> 15:48.562
Oh, what a surprise! I wasn't expecting it. I
don't have a prepared statement or anything!

15:49.667 --> 15:51.567
The court understands, believe me...

15:51.735 --> 15:53.498
...and we are grateful.

15:53.671 --> 15:56.333
- Oh, thank you. Thank you!
- Okay, girls, we won!

15:56.674 --> 15:59.837
We've made provisions for all the women
through their consulates...

16:00.010 --> 16:01.944
...except Miss Sweden.

16:02.112 --> 16:05.479
Nobody was there when we called,
but they will be and she'll be taken there.

16:05.649 --> 16:07.378
Fine.

16:09.420 --> 16:11.285
You've been acquitted.

16:11.789 --> 16:13.689
You're free.

16:17.194 --> 16:18.889
We won't have to use these.

16:23.634 --> 16:27.536
Of course, you all don't have to go
to your consulates if you don't want to.

16:27.705 --> 16:30.105
Would you tell her that?
No, go ahead. Tell her that.

16:30.274 --> 16:31.502
This is a free country.

16:31.675 --> 16:36.408
Lives have been laid down so that you have
the right to assemble anywhere you wish!

16:38.082 --> 16:41.518
Excuse me. Who do I see about
finding somebody who was arrested?

16:41.685 --> 16:43.152
- I'm the court clerk.
- Oh, great.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.982
Do you know where I can find
Mrs. Eleanor Brandon?

16:46.957 --> 16:48.948
Yeah. She's right over there.

16:49.526 --> 16:52.962
Thank God! Ma, what are you doing here?

16:53.530 --> 16:54.827
Are you all right?

16:54.999 --> 16:56.626
Leonard, what a surprise.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.598
They told me you were under arrest
for breaking a window.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.635
It's all straightened out. Don't worry.

17:01.805 --> 17:05.297
- This is your mother, Mr?
- Brandon. Leonard Brandon, Your Honor.

17:05.476 --> 17:07.773
Yes, this is my mother.

17:08.479 --> 17:11.141
Look, I am sorry if she has caused
you any trouble.

17:11.315 --> 17:12.680
No trouble. No trouble at all.

17:12.849 --> 17:16.650
Actually, she has been doing a lot of...

17:17.221 --> 17:20.520
...weird things for the last couple of years,
and, well...

17:20.691 --> 17:24.319
...I think we're gonna have to seriously
consider putting her in a home...

17:24.494 --> 17:25.962
...or a sanitarium or something.

17:26.130 --> 17:28.121
I'm in a sanitarium now!

17:28.332 --> 17:31.893
No, you're not, Ma.
You're in an adult apartment complex.

17:32.269 --> 17:33.861
It's a wonderful place, really.

17:34.038 --> 17:36.165
People her own age, communal meals...

17:36.340 --> 17:38.433
...bocce ball.
- It's jail!

17:38.609 --> 17:40.167
It is not a jail, Ma.

17:40.344 --> 17:42.369
So how come I'm not allowed visitors?

17:42.546 --> 17:45.572
- They're allowed visitors.
- So how come I never see you there?

17:45.749 --> 17:48.149
Mom, can we not
go into this now, please?

17:48.318 --> 17:51.082
- I've got a business to run.
- Harry's got a business too...

17:51.255 --> 17:54.986
...but he makes time for me.
- Who the hell is Harry?

17:57.294 --> 17:58.955
The judge?

18:00.230 --> 18:03.131
Oh, well, listen, Your Honor, I apologize.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.268
I didn't know she was bothering you.

18:05.436 --> 18:07.370
That's a lonely lady there,
Mr. Brandon.

18:09.440 --> 18:12.807
- I beg your pardon?
- No, I think it's hers you ought to beg.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.445
I don't understand a word you're saying.

18:16.880 --> 18:20.316
You know, I don't like your tone
in my courtroom, Mr. Brandon.

18:20.484 --> 18:23.044
I'm going to sentence you
for contempt of court.

18:23.220 --> 18:25.313
Sentence me for contempt of court?

18:25.489 --> 18:26.854
You can't do that!

18:27.324 --> 18:31.090
- Miss Wagner.
- Never say to a judge:

18:31.261 --> 18:33.423
"You can't do that."

18:34.399 --> 18:37.891
It is the sentence of this court that
you be held in contempt and jailed...

18:38.069 --> 18:41.300
...until such time as you choose to...

18:41.739 --> 18:45.539
...take advantage of the fact
that you got a mother.

18:47.946 --> 18:50.744
- That's crazy.
- Miss Wagner.

18:51.583 --> 18:54.074
Never say to a judge:

18:54.452 --> 18:56.420
"That's crazy."

18:56.754 --> 18:59.222
Your mother's lonely, Mr. Brandon.

18:59.390 --> 19:02.416
And if you can't see that now...

19:02.594 --> 19:06.894
...then no amount of time in jail is
gonna help you see it any more clearly.

19:07.065 --> 19:10.432
The court withdraws
the contempt charge.

19:12.003 --> 19:14.471
- Say, am I?
- Free? Yes.

19:14.639 --> 19:16.197
Thought so.

19:16.374 --> 19:18.365
You have a lot of pets,
don't you, Eleanor?

19:19.110 --> 19:21.044
Yeah! Oh, I used to.

19:21.212 --> 19:22.736
Fish, mostly.

19:22.914 --> 19:26.850
The man at the pet store told me
I overfed them, though.

19:27.018 --> 19:30.749
I thought floating was just
their way of resting.

19:32.624 --> 19:34.421
Come on, Ma. I'll take you back.

19:34.592 --> 19:36.321
Fish can't talk to you, Leonard.

19:36.794 --> 19:40.195
Oh, thank you very much, sir.
I'll make a note of that.

19:40.932 --> 19:43.025
Your mother misses you, Leonard.

19:43.201 --> 19:47.900
She misses you so much
that she invented another son.

19:49.207 --> 19:51.004
Who?

19:55.113 --> 19:56.910
Oh, Ma.

19:57.081 --> 20:00.676
A judge? You harassed a judge?

20:00.852 --> 20:03.013
I can't believe that you would do that.

20:03.188 --> 20:05.247
Can you believe that she would do that?

20:05.423 --> 20:07.414
Oh, Ma.

20:08.693 --> 20:11.127
Maybe Leonard's right.

20:11.296 --> 20:13.423
Maybe I ought to be put away.

20:13.598 --> 20:15.532
I don't think so.

20:16.434 --> 20:19.528
I understand, Eleanor, really.

20:20.405 --> 20:23.806
- I'm sorry.
- How did you know so much about me?

20:25.843 --> 20:28.778
I read a newspaper article...

20:28.947 --> 20:32.280
...about how you grew up
without a mother...

20:32.450 --> 20:34.941
...and then I did a little more research.

20:35.119 --> 20:37.280
And then you decided to adopt me, huh?

20:38.623 --> 20:42.423
- Yeah, something like that.
- And Uncle Otto?

20:42.594 --> 20:45.563
Lucky guess. I almost said three.

20:50.668 --> 20:54.729
Harry, I guess I thought...

20:54.906 --> 20:59.002
...maybe, down deep inside, that, well...

20:59.177 --> 21:01.737
...that maybe you'd get something
out of this too.

21:01.913 --> 21:04.313
I did. I really did, Eleanor.

21:05.650 --> 21:11.179
But don't ever do that to another
human being for the rest of your life.

21:13.424 --> 21:15.824
Come on, Ma.
Let's go get something to eat.

21:15.994 --> 21:18.462
I'm sorry, Leonard.
Eleanor and I have a date.

21:18.796 --> 21:20.627
This is my mother.

21:20.798 --> 21:23.392
She is going with me.

21:25.637 --> 21:27.662
Some other time, Harry?

21:28.706 --> 21:30.799
Sure, some other time.

21:37.782 --> 21:40.546
Mom always did like you best.

22:18.057 --> 22:19.991
Shut up, will you?
