4L

02:02.255 --> 02:03.463
<i>Another friend,</i>

02:03.630 --> 02:05.380
<i>or friend of the night.</i>

02:05.922 --> 02:08.547
<i>Hello. Who's calling?</i>

02:08.963 --> 02:11.047
<i>Hello, my name's Amaia.</i>

02:11.380 --> 02:12.838
<i>Hi, Amaia.</i>

02:13.130 --> 02:16.547
<i>Thanks for your call.
Tell us, where are you calling from?</i>

02:17.255 --> 02:20.338
<i>I'm calling from here...
The Basque country.</i>

02:20.755 --> 02:23.088
<i>What are you doing awake
at this time Amaia?</i>

02:23.672 --> 02:24.672
<i>Well...</i>

02:25.588 --> 02:27.380
<i>Sometimes you need
to talk to someone.</i>

02:27.505 --> 02:30.672
<i>The nights...
The nights are tough and...</i>

02:30.922 --> 02:33.297
<i>Sometimes you need some company.</i>

02:34.338 --> 02:35.547
<i>We're listening.</i>

02:36.172 --> 02:40.755
<i>- What's troubling you?
- Well... I've run away from home.</i>

02:42.088 --> 02:44.713
<i>One day you wake up
and you've got no reason</i>

02:44.922 --> 02:46.380
<i>to get out bed and...</i>

02:47.047 --> 02:49.005
<i>You realize you hate your job.</i>

02:49.630 --> 02:52.963
<i>You barely even recognize
your husband anymore.</i>

02:53.338 --> 02:54.963
<i>You have nothing left in common.</i>

02:55.463 --> 02:57.130
<i>It's no kind of life.</i>

02:57.547 --> 02:59.838
<i>So you decided to disappear,
just like that?</i>

03:00.005 --> 03:01.505
TANEZROUFT DESERT
ALGERIA, 1979

03:01.588 --> 03:03.297
I left without telling anyone.

03:03.547 --> 03:05.387
<i>I packed my bags
and left everything behind me.</i>

03:05.588 --> 03:09.005
<i>Now I live alone in the country
with my garden, my chickens.</i>

03:09.547 --> 03:11.963
<i>- And I'm so happy.
- That's great.</i>

03:12.130 --> 03:13.547
<i>Where do you live, Amaia?</i>

06:37.172 --> 06:39.005
<i>Excuse me, this is private property.</i>

06:43.630 --> 06:44.880
<i>Can I help you?</i>

06:52.255 --> 06:53.255
<i>My God!</i>

06:53.380 --> 06:55.005
You've changed a lot.

06:55.172 --> 06:56.880
You've still got the same big nose,

06:57.505 --> 06:58.922
but now you walk with a cane.

06:59.380 --> 07:00.922
It comes with the vineyard.

07:05.255 --> 07:06.380
Jean Pierre...

07:13.630 --> 07:16.172
- Is all this yours?
- The bank's.

07:16.838 --> 07:19.630
- I heard it was yours.
- Sometimes it is.

07:19.797 --> 07:22.172
I tell women it's mine!

07:23.588 --> 07:24.588
All of them?

07:24.755 --> 07:26.380
Except the women from the bank!

07:40.088 --> 07:42.672
- So you kept going down there?
- Yes, several times.

07:42.838 --> 07:46.963
But I haven't been back
since the accident,

07:47.755 --> 07:49.838
and that was over ten years ago.

07:50.463 --> 07:51.463
What about you?

07:51.838 --> 07:54.213
I haven't been back
since our last trip together.

08:02.213 --> 08:04.547
No, thanks.
I stopped a long time ago.

08:05.213 --> 08:06.630
I only stop when I'm asleep.

08:08.172 --> 08:09.463
How's life treating you?

08:10.088 --> 08:11.172
We're not talking.

08:11.630 --> 08:13.350
I don't bother life
and she leaves me alone.

08:13.422 --> 08:15.463
Leaves you alone in a good way,

08:15.630 --> 08:17.830
or leaves you alone
meaning I should change the subject?

08:20.172 --> 08:21.172
OK.

08:40.255 --> 08:41.630
He's dying.

08:47.338 --> 08:48.922
I want you to come with me.

08:59.922 --> 09:02.213
I'm not sure this
is the best time for me.

09:05.422 --> 09:08.797
So write to his wife
and tell her not to let him die yet,

09:09.630 --> 09:10.990
that it's not a good time for you.

09:30.755 --> 09:33.963
Alex, answer the door, will you?

09:34.297 --> 09:36.737
If it's the people from the bank,
tell them you don't know me.

09:37.380 --> 09:38.880
But I don't know you.

09:39.713 --> 09:40.963
So, tell them that.

09:48.797 --> 09:49.797
Hello!

09:50.630 --> 09:52.880
We're looking for Joseba Montalbán,

09:53.338 --> 09:54.963
he lived here years ago.

09:55.088 --> 09:57.755
There's no one else here. I live alone.

09:58.422 --> 10:00.172
How do you know Joseba?

10:02.505 --> 10:03.505
Are you his daughter?

10:04.088 --> 10:05.088
That depends.

10:06.505 --> 10:07.547
Are you from the bank?

10:07.713 --> 10:09.547
We're friends of your father.

10:10.547 --> 10:12.422
My dad never had any friends.

10:14.297 --> 10:15.922
This is going to be fun.

10:31.672 --> 10:32.672
OK.

10:35.005 --> 10:36.005
So...?

10:38.380 --> 10:40.260
Jean Pierre and I,
we are going to see your dad.

10:40.630 --> 10:42.088
Our plane leaves tomorrow.

10:43.297 --> 10:46.297
We thought that you might come with us.

10:46.463 --> 10:48.338
- To Timbuktu?
- Yes.

10:49.463 --> 10:51.297
I haven't lost anything in Timbuktu.

10:51.463 --> 10:53.130
- You've lost your dad.
- No.

10:53.297 --> 10:56.130
My dad lost himself ten years ago...
Without warning...

10:56.255 --> 10:59.547
It would be a good opportunity
to see him again.

11:01.172 --> 11:02.172
He can come here.

11:02.255 --> 11:03.713
Can't you read?

11:04.380 --> 11:06.505
- Your dad can't come here.
- See you, babe!

11:06.672 --> 11:08.838
I'll be back tomorrow
to tighten your screws!

11:19.130 --> 11:20.172
Let's go.

11:27.005 --> 11:28.755
If you don't come with us,

11:29.255 --> 11:30.755
you'll probably

11:30.963 --> 11:32.505
never see him again.

11:38.213 --> 11:39.797
If you really cared about my dad,

11:41.255 --> 11:43.005
you wouldn't go visit him by plane.

11:49.130 --> 11:50.963
No way...

11:53.672 --> 11:55.172
A 4L.

11:55.422 --> 11:56.630
<i>She's a beauty.</i>

11:57.213 --> 11:59.838
He spent years fixing it
to take me to the desert.

12:01.547 --> 12:02.880
I'm still waiting.

12:03.047 --> 12:05.797
The Marreau brothers drove this car

12:05.963 --> 12:11.005
in the first
Paris-Dakar rally in 1979.

12:13.588 --> 12:15.005
They finished second.

12:16.505 --> 12:18.797
He told me he bought it
at an auction in Paris,

12:18.963 --> 12:21.797
but I think he stole it
from a farm in Palencia.

12:25.172 --> 12:26.505
She's perfect.

12:28.588 --> 12:31.213
And we have everything we need
to camp out.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.338
You want to come with us?

12:41.047 --> 12:42.047
No.

12:42.463 --> 12:43.463
What then?

12:44.297 --> 12:45.963
I don't want to stay here either.

13:12.547 --> 13:15.422
Go to duty free
and get me three bottles of gin.

13:17.672 --> 13:18.713
Can't you go?

13:19.130 --> 13:20.130
Yes.

13:21.213 --> 13:22.588
But I'm the boss around here.

13:29.713 --> 13:30.922
Why don't you go?

13:31.547 --> 13:33.130
I don't know
how much each bottle costs.

13:33.297 --> 13:35.172
I want to see if we can trust her.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.005
Your two bottles.

13:43.963 --> 13:45.255
I said three.

13:51.588 --> 13:52.713
And your money.

13:57.505 --> 13:59.838
Things you pick up in a foster home.

14:04.672 --> 14:06.297
She's like her dad.

14:08.922 --> 14:10.005
Just like him.

14:25.963 --> 14:27.255
<i>Dear friends,</i>

14:28.047 --> 14:30.380
as the great
Carl Sagan would say:

14:30.547 --> 14:34.380
here begins
an extraordinary adventure.

14:34.963 --> 14:40.755
The journey of two solitary men
against the power of nature.

14:41.838 --> 14:43.088
Do you see this car?

14:44.422 --> 14:45.422
Now...

14:45.963 --> 14:49.005
Look at this dot on the map.

14:49.130 --> 14:50.963
Timbuktu, our destination...

14:51.130 --> 14:55.838
And in between,
an "imperetrable" desert.

14:55.922 --> 14:57.380
Impenetrable.

14:57.547 --> 15:00.047
Just like the great
adventures into space,

15:00.213 --> 15:02.755
this could be
a one way journey,

15:02.963 --> 15:05.547
our return cannot be guaranteed.

15:06.213 --> 15:08.963
A journey of love for humanity.

15:09.213 --> 15:12.005
A journey of love for Africa.

15:12.172 --> 15:16.963
Traveling through Africa is
the last legal drug of our times!

15:17.088 --> 15:17.963
Cut!

15:18.088 --> 15:19.963
- Cut!
- Cut? Why?

15:20.130 --> 15:21.297
You said drug.

15:21.463 --> 15:23.797
I didn't say drug,
I said legal drug.

15:23.963 --> 15:25.380
Legal drug
includes the word drug.

15:25.547 --> 15:27.505
You said no drugs.

15:27.672 --> 15:29.172
But it's a metaphor:

15:29.338 --> 15:31.505
legal drug, journey, Africa...

15:31.672 --> 15:33.797
You didn't mention Joseba either.

15:35.297 --> 15:36.547
And you're overacting.

15:40.172 --> 15:42.463
What do you mean I'm overacting?

15:42.547 --> 15:43.255
He's right.

15:43.422 --> 15:44.838
It's bullshit.

15:47.922 --> 15:50.630
- Let's go again.
- OK, let's go.

15:51.047 --> 15:52.588
Impenetrable.

15:53.297 --> 15:54.755
French asshole!

16:11.630 --> 16:12.630
Look.

16:12.963 --> 16:14.547
The idea is to start like this...

16:14.713 --> 16:18.047
Over the music at the start,
we'll put this footage...

16:20.588 --> 16:22.338
Then when I talk about Joseba,

16:22.505 --> 16:25.713
we'll show a shot of him
and we'll mix the shots

16:25.922 --> 16:28.047
of the car now
with the ones from the trip...

16:28.838 --> 16:32.463
- Was it in 1980, or 1981?
- 1982.

16:32.630 --> 16:34.547
When you got us lost
and we were robbed.

16:34.713 --> 16:36.672
- Are you sure?
- Course I am!

16:36.838 --> 16:39.422
We were celebrating all our birthdays.
Some nomads appeared

16:39.588 --> 16:41.213
and joined in the party.

16:41.838 --> 16:44.922
- It was our last trip together.
- Ah, yes, I remember.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.088
It was your 21st
and our 29th birthdays.

16:48.255 --> 16:51.172
It was the last time
I had to babysit you!

16:53.047 --> 16:56.338
Ely, look, here's your dad.

17:07.505 --> 17:10.213
- Are you always like this?
- Like what?

17:10.588 --> 17:12.047
Like two old ladies?

17:12.338 --> 17:14.255
We're not like old ladies.

17:14.630 --> 17:17.297
You spend all day talking about things
that happened 80 years ago!

17:17.463 --> 17:21.463
Tell me, what's the most exciting thing
that's happened to you in the last 20?

17:24.130 --> 17:25.338
Take your feet off the table.

17:30.380 --> 17:31.588
Yes, grandma.

17:34.213 --> 17:36.922
Are you going to treat her like that
the whole trip?

17:48.963 --> 17:54.297
<i>I met the half-man, half-monkey
in my neighborhood. Yes.</i>

17:57.005 --> 17:59.005
<i>Whenever I travel to Africa
with Tocho,</i>

17:59.963 --> 18:03.338
<i>he suffers a mutation
which turns him into a monkey.</i>

18:04.797 --> 18:08.463
<i>He's the most disgusting guy
I've ever met and he's beyond help.</i>

18:08.630 --> 18:10.838
<i>He was born
with a manufacturing defect.</i>

18:14.505 --> 18:17.172
<i>Jean Pierre was born
to be a nobleman,</i>

18:17.797 --> 18:19.713
<i>and I'm certain he'll die trying.</i>

18:19.797 --> 18:21.547
<i>He has two weaknesses:</i>

18:22.338 --> 18:24.380
<i>Having affairs with women</i>

18:24.547 --> 18:27.547
<i>and the terrible diarrhea he gets
every time he's in the desert.</i>

18:28.838 --> 18:30.963
<i>These are my two travel companions,</i>

18:31.505 --> 18:33.422
<i>a fucking nightmare.</i>

18:36.380 --> 18:39.088
<i>No... It's all in your imagination.</i>

18:39.255 --> 18:41.130
<i>It's not the reality.</i>

18:41.713 --> 18:43.297
<i>I never said that.</i>

18:43.963 --> 18:45.297
<i>I'm telling you I didn't!</i>

18:45.963 --> 18:48.963
<i>Listen, we're going to
count to ten</i>

18:49.088 --> 18:51.922
<i>so you can think about
what you just said... OK?</i>

18:52.047 --> 18:55.130
<i>One... two... three...</i>

18:55.297 --> 18:58.297
<i>Let me finish!
Four... five...</i>

18:58.463 --> 19:01.755
<i>six... seven...
I haven't finished yet!</i>

19:01.963 --> 19:05.047
<i>Eight...
nine... ten.</i>

19:05.213 --> 19:06.672
<i>What do you say now?</i>

19:06.838 --> 19:09.672
<i>Charlotte! Listen to me!
Charlotte!</i>

19:11.963 --> 19:13.380
<i>Shit!</i>

19:13.922 --> 19:15.213
<i>Shit!</i>

19:26.088 --> 19:27.172
Where's Tocho?

19:28.088 --> 19:29.672
I thought he was with you.

19:31.047 --> 19:33.047
Aren't you tired? It's late.

19:33.213 --> 19:36.755
I'm trying to upload
photos on Instagram, but I can't get 4G.

19:37.338 --> 19:39.963
There's no water...
How are you going to get 4G?

19:40.713 --> 19:41.797
Fuck!

19:43.338 --> 19:44.630
Don't shout!

19:47.963 --> 19:49.838
You're fucking hysterical!

19:52.297 --> 19:54.088
I don't know why the fuck
we brought you!

20:06.422 --> 20:07.505
Hey...

20:08.338 --> 20:09.422
Calm down.

20:09.588 --> 20:11.963
You're making her life impossible.

20:12.463 --> 20:14.130
Aren't you her dad's friend?

20:15.630 --> 20:17.797
Her dad doesn't even know
she's coming.

20:17.963 --> 20:20.338
That doesn't matter.
Here...

20:21.213 --> 20:22.213
Drink this.

20:23.380 --> 20:24.922
Perhaps he doesn't want to see her.

20:25.963 --> 20:28.713
Why wouldn't he after ten years?

20:31.130 --> 20:34.588
If he hasn't seen her for ten years,
he must have his reasons.

20:35.922 --> 20:37.297
Why are you acting like this?

21:02.255 --> 21:04.422
Hey, my friend! I got something for you!

21:04.505 --> 21:06.380
- Look!
- Out the way!

21:39.797 --> 21:41.380
- Hashish?
- No.

21:47.338 --> 21:50.005
Excuse me...
You're Spanish, right?

21:52.047 --> 21:53.713
What's in that bottle?

21:56.963 --> 22:00.505
Hey! Wait up!
Soriano, from Valencia.

22:00.713 --> 22:02.814
I'm looking for something
you really like in Valencia.

22:02.838 --> 22:04.422
Finding paella here's tricky!

22:04.838 --> 22:06.047
Hashish.

22:06.838 --> 22:08.963
I've got the best... It's first rate.

22:09.130 --> 22:10.922
How many kilos you want?

22:13.380 --> 22:14.547
Tocho, from Bilbao.

22:15.130 --> 22:19.755
I did a degree in chemistry.
Passed with flying colors too.

22:20.297 --> 22:23.797
After that I got a job as a courier,
to try and pay for

22:23.963 --> 22:27.172
a master's degree,
but I got fed up with it.

22:27.338 --> 22:30.880
And a buddy said,
with the welfare money I was getting,

22:31.005 --> 22:32.963
I'd be better off living in Morocco,

22:33.130 --> 22:36.588
so I thought I'd come for a few months
until I found a better job.

22:37.172 --> 22:38.172
How's it going?

22:38.338 --> 22:40.297
I've been here two years already.

22:42.672 --> 22:44.338
What are you doing in Tangier?

22:44.880 --> 22:46.255
I'm on my way to Mali.

22:46.588 --> 22:47.588
By plane?

22:47.797 --> 22:48.963
In a 4L.

22:50.255 --> 22:52.963
A 4L? You really are from Bilbao!

22:53.880 --> 22:55.838
In the 80s,
me and some friends would go

22:55.963 --> 22:58.213
to France,
buy second-hand 4Ls,

22:58.797 --> 23:00.338
then sell them in Mali.

23:00.505 --> 23:03.213
They're sturdy cars.
We'd sell them in no time.

23:03.380 --> 23:05.463
- Make a lot of money?
- Enough to pay for

23:05.630 --> 23:07.713
a plane trip back,
not much more.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.838
Well, it's not about money,
it's about adventure.

23:09.963 --> 23:11.380
Like me with the hash.

23:12.380 --> 23:13.380
Listen...

23:13.463 --> 23:16.922
Could I get a ride with you
to the edge of the desert?

23:31.130 --> 23:32.838
Pass the joint.

23:36.047 --> 23:38.630
I said no drugs on this trip!

23:45.172 --> 23:46.172
<i>Shit!</i>

23:49.213 --> 23:51.088
Shit! I don't fucking believe it!

23:51.255 --> 23:53.880
- Open the window! Help me!
- OK, OK!

23:59.130 --> 24:01.463
<i>- Good morning.
- Good morning, Sir.</i>

24:02.213 --> 24:03.880
<i>Passports, please.</i>

24:07.005 --> 24:08.005
<i>Here you go.</i>

24:13.297 --> 24:14.297
<i>Spanish?</i>

24:14.755 --> 24:16.297
<i>They are. I'm French.</i>

24:16.963 --> 24:18.005
And I'm Basque.

24:25.213 --> 24:26.588
Stay inside the vehicle.

24:38.463 --> 24:39.713
Hello!

24:39.963 --> 24:41.755
What a gorgeous dog!
What's his name?

24:41.922 --> 24:42.922
Gaddafi.

24:43.005 --> 24:44.297
Oh! What a lovely name!

24:45.797 --> 24:47.005
Yeah, lovely name!

24:47.213 --> 24:48.422
Gaddafi!

24:49.963 --> 24:51.713
Here, fetch! Fetch!

24:53.255 --> 24:56.130
- Get out and show me what you've got.
- OK...

24:57.297 --> 24:58.463
I'll get out, but...

24:59.463 --> 25:00.505
I don't...

25:12.922 --> 25:16.297
This is your fault for
letting a stranger come with us.

25:16.463 --> 25:18.213
Get off me!
I know how to walk.

25:18.338 --> 25:19.880
Sit down and behave yourself.

25:22.588 --> 25:23.838
Give us a smoke.

25:24.463 --> 25:25.505
I don't smoke.

25:26.755 --> 25:28.963
Hey, you! Give me a smoke.

25:30.422 --> 25:31.630
I don't smoke either.

25:33.963 --> 25:36.963
Just what part of "no drugs"
didn't you understand?

25:37.172 --> 25:39.922
I'm sorry... I'm just so used to
carrying it in my balls,

25:40.088 --> 25:41.168
I forgot it was even there.

25:41.588 --> 25:43.338
It's like my third ball by now.

25:43.505 --> 25:44.755
What can we offer the police?

25:44.922 --> 25:47.213
We've got just enough to survive on.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.630
And we've got tobacco
and enough booze to open a bar.

25:49.797 --> 25:52.963
Ah, well a little bottle
of whisky could really help us out.

25:54.547 --> 25:57.547
Imagine the whiskey in one hand,

25:57.713 --> 26:00.297
a cigarette in the other
and in the middle...

26:01.505 --> 26:05.922
What? Paradise!
Look at lovely Romina.

26:06.463 --> 26:07.505
So... Let's see..

26:07.672 --> 26:10.713
Two gins and a carton of cigarettes,

26:11.588 --> 26:12.755
30 euros,

26:13.380 --> 26:15.838
the whiskey, 10 euros,

26:16.172 --> 26:19.422
and the poster
and this carton of cigarettes are on me.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.630
So everything's cool. Right?

26:32.422 --> 26:33.838
Come on, dude!

26:35.922 --> 26:37.338
Jerks!

26:38.547 --> 26:42.255
- Assholes!
- No more strangers on this trip.

26:42.422 --> 26:45.797
We're doing things my way
from now on.

27:06.088 --> 27:08.505
Ely... Why are you here?

27:10.088 --> 27:11.797
To see my dad, right?

27:11.963 --> 27:14.338
No, that's not what I mean.

27:16.172 --> 27:17.547
What then?

27:22.963 --> 27:24.672
Things haven't really gone my way.

27:28.630 --> 27:30.672
What I mean by that is...

27:31.422 --> 27:33.963
Well, you know what it means.

27:35.838 --> 27:37.088
Things have gone bad.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.172
Pretty bad.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.422
With work or a boy?

27:43.588 --> 27:45.422
Both at the same time.

27:45.963 --> 27:47.130
At the same time?

27:48.547 --> 27:50.338
That's an achievement!

27:50.672 --> 27:52.672
Not if you work for your ex.

27:53.088 --> 27:56.588
You're too young
to say things have gone bad for you.

27:58.255 --> 27:59.963
They could go worse I guess.

28:00.338 --> 28:02.130
Especially if we find my dad.

28:03.088 --> 28:04.130
Don't you want to see him?

28:06.172 --> 28:07.797
I've always hated him for leaving,

28:09.880 --> 28:11.922
though if I'm honest,
I hated him because...

28:12.797 --> 28:15.005
it worked out fucking well for me.

28:15.505 --> 28:17.463
I know it sounds strange, but it's true.

28:17.963 --> 28:21.422
Whenever something went wrong,
I could blame it on Dad for leaving me.

28:23.797 --> 28:25.172
I'm an asshole...

28:29.755 --> 28:30.838
I'm sorry.

28:47.672 --> 28:49.130
Why not just forget her?

28:50.130 --> 28:51.713
Because I love her...

28:53.297 --> 28:56.380
But you fucked that other one,
what's that chick's name?

28:56.630 --> 28:58.047
You fucked someone else?

28:59.963 --> 29:01.172
Catherine.

29:01.672 --> 29:04.088
That's it, Catherine.

29:04.297 --> 29:06.547
- Your go.
- No, it's your go.

29:06.963 --> 29:08.172
You can't love her that much.

29:08.338 --> 29:10.047
- What do you know?
- Do you love her,

29:10.130 --> 29:11.330
or do you want to be with her?

29:11.755 --> 29:14.380
- What's the difference?
- She's right.

29:14.505 --> 29:16.630
- Shut it, you!
- Neither of the above.

29:16.838 --> 29:20.005
- You just don't want to be alone.
- That's it!

29:20.338 --> 29:23.088
- I don't care about that.
- Bullshit!

29:23.547 --> 29:28.213
If you didn't care, you wouldn't be miles
from home, talking about her.

29:28.797 --> 29:31.922
I've had enough of following her
around like a cat...

29:32.255 --> 29:34.047
Cats don't follow their owners around.

29:34.213 --> 29:37.505
Like a dog then, or an iguana,
or whatever you like...

29:37.630 --> 29:38.838
Like a snake.

29:40.005 --> 29:45.297
I'm going to rent an apartment
and become an eligible bachelor.

29:45.380 --> 29:47.297
<i>Sin is what makes
the world go round.</i>

29:47.463 --> 29:48.797
Bachelor, sure... Eligible?

29:48.963 --> 29:51.838
<i>And the desert is the epicenter of sin.</i>

29:52.047 --> 29:53.922
<i>One day I'm going to prove
that in the desert</i>

29:54.088 --> 29:56.838
<i>a man's capacity
to get an erection doubles.</i>

29:56.963 --> 29:59.755
<i>It's actually a theory
by some explorer or other,</i>

29:59.922 --> 30:05.255
<i>who used science as an excuse to go round
boning half the women in Timbuktu...</i>

30:05.422 --> 30:07.672
<i>And two or three camels as well.</i>

30:07.838 --> 30:10.297
<i>He had to flee,
because the Tuaregs</i>

30:10.463 --> 30:13.213
<i>wanted to circumcise him...
at the neck!</i>

30:13.380 --> 30:15.463
Overacting... Definitely overacting.

30:16.297 --> 30:17.297
Olé!

30:40.505 --> 30:42.172
Jean Pierre, you look a mess!

31:00.213 --> 31:01.255
Look, look!

31:05.755 --> 31:06.963
Careful! The map!

31:29.547 --> 31:30.838
Full moon!

31:45.672 --> 31:46.797
Dear friends,

31:47.255 --> 31:50.922
on the other side of that barrier,
the end of the world begins.

31:51.088 --> 31:53.713
The mother of all deserts.

31:53.880 --> 31:55.963
A dead, empty land,

31:56.213 --> 31:58.713
in which only the best...

31:59.713 --> 32:00.963
- Cut.
- Cut!

32:01.130 --> 32:03.630
- Why cut, damn it?
- The barrier... The barrier.

32:08.213 --> 32:09.005
<i>Good morning.</i>

32:09.213 --> 32:11.172
<i>Come with me.
You have to register yourselves.</i>

32:27.172 --> 32:28.672
<i>What's the motive for your trip?</i>

32:28.838 --> 32:31.547
<i>We're going to Timbuktu,
to visit a friend.</i>

32:36.797 --> 32:38.877
<i>I'll need to see
your vehicle inspection certificate.</i>

32:39.547 --> 32:41.630
<i>My vehicle inspection certificate?</i>

32:41.797 --> 32:43.797
<i>You can't continue without it.</i>

32:44.047 --> 32:45.505
Another ball-buster.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.463
<i>- What did your friend say?
- Nothing.</i>

32:47.630 --> 32:49.005
Shut your mouth!

32:50.088 --> 32:51.713
<i>Yes, I know what you mean.</i>

32:51.880 --> 32:53.255
<i>Vehicle inspection certificate.</i>

32:53.422 --> 32:56.172
<i>It's in the car.
I'll go get it.</i>

33:01.672 --> 33:03.106
They obviously want us to bribe them.

33:03.130 --> 33:05.755
You think you know
what an Algerian soldier wants?

33:05.922 --> 33:08.088
I'm not giving those bastards
a single dirham!

33:08.255 --> 33:10.630
The vehicle inspection certificate!

33:10.797 --> 33:12.088
<i>Give me a break!</i>

33:12.297 --> 33:13.880
Ely, give me a hand.

33:16.213 --> 33:19.838
They want a vehicle inspection
certificate? No problem!

33:19.963 --> 33:22.755
And if they want the insurance papers
for the spare wheel,

33:22.922 --> 33:24.172
they're going to get that too.

33:24.547 --> 33:29.172
Open this and look for a folder
called "Admin Africa".

33:29.338 --> 33:30.547
Here it is.

33:30.838 --> 33:33.755
"Single Women in Africa III,
The Revenge of the Mandingo".

33:33.922 --> 33:36.463
I said folder, not video!

33:37.338 --> 33:40.130
Look for a document called "4L”.

33:41.505 --> 33:43.338
Got it. Registration date?

33:43.505 --> 33:46.130
24th January, 1975.

33:46.213 --> 33:46.963
It's that old?

33:47.172 --> 33:48.838
This car's in better shape than you.

33:49.630 --> 33:51.588
Old would be me... Or Tocho.

33:51.755 --> 33:53.088
Especially Tocho.

33:53.547 --> 33:55.505
Paper... Here.

33:56.130 --> 33:57.130
OK...

33:57.547 --> 33:59.130
- Here it is.
- Pass it here.

34:02.172 --> 34:03.172
And this one...

34:04.213 --> 34:05.213
Why so many?

34:05.297 --> 34:07.297
- Isn't that too many?
- It's all about the stamps.

34:08.963 --> 34:10.547
It's what most impresses.

34:27.172 --> 34:28.672
<i>Is the vehicle in good condition?</i>

34:28.838 --> 34:29.963
<i>Better than me.</i>

34:30.838 --> 34:32.422
<i>Do you have enough water?</i>

34:32.588 --> 34:34.797
<i>Enough to open a dolphin sanctuary!</i>

34:35.422 --> 34:37.880
<i>You mustn't leave the road
under any circumstances.</i>

34:38.672 --> 34:40.797
<i>It's marked out with black barrels.</i>

34:41.922 --> 34:44.588
<i>980km of desert road.</i>

34:44.922 --> 34:46.255
<i>If there are no hold ups,</i>

34:46.422 --> 34:47.755
<i>you can do it in three days.</i>

34:48.463 --> 34:50.297
<i>Avoid driving at night.</i>

34:50.463 --> 34:51.463
What did he say?

34:51.630 --> 34:55.338
That the sunsets
in the desert are stunning.

34:55.505 --> 34:58.547
<i>Be on the lookout for bandits,</i>

34:58.922 --> 35:02.922
<i>they're very dangerous
and we can't help you with that.</i>

35:03.088 --> 35:04.088
And now?

35:04.380 --> 35:09.547
That at night you can see
spectacular meteor showers.

35:10.713 --> 35:12.130
<i>You may continue on your way.</i>

35:12.297 --> 35:14.547
<i>- Good luck.
- Thank you.</i>

35:14.880 --> 35:18.963
<i>Around the 500km mark,
you'll find “Oil Drum 5”.</i>

35:19.338 --> 35:22.630
<i>It's a good place to stop and rest.
You can buy gas and water there.</i>

35:22.797 --> 35:24.463
<i>The owner's French too.</i>

35:25.838 --> 35:27.297
<i>He's still alive?</i>

35:27.463 --> 35:28.630
<i>Yes.</i>

35:28.797 --> 35:29.963
What's he saying?

35:30.922 --> 35:32.547
He hopes we don't get lost.

35:34.588 --> 35:35.963
What an idiot!

35:42.005 --> 35:44.088
<i>Wait, wait!</i>

35:47.213 --> 35:48.463
<i>What is it?</i>

35:48.797 --> 35:50.838
<i>It's forbidden to cross the Tanezrouft</i>

35:50.963 --> 35:52.963
<i>in a single vehicle.
You'll have to wait</i>

35:53.130 --> 35:55.338
<i>to form a convoy.
It's for safety.</i>

35:55.505 --> 35:57.838
<i>I already told you,
this isn't the first time</i>

35:57.963 --> 35:59.922
<i>I'm crossing the desert.</i>

36:01.963 --> 36:03.505
<i>How long are we talking?</i>

36:04.088 --> 36:05.297
<i>I don't know.</i>

36:05.630 --> 36:08.505
<i>Could be two days...</i>

36:08.880 --> 36:10.130
<i>Two weeks...</i>

36:10.672 --> 36:11.755
<i>Or never.</i>

36:15.755 --> 36:17.172
What did the jerk say now?

36:23.547 --> 36:24.672
Cigarette?

36:31.130 --> 36:32.172
Pass it! Over here!

36:34.255 --> 36:35.922
After the football, "calimocho".

36:36.088 --> 36:41.505
"Calimocho"? Coke, ice,
and cheap wine. Cold.

36:43.547 --> 36:44.838
Mine, mine!

36:50.338 --> 36:51.422
You deal?

36:52.547 --> 36:53.630
No?

36:55.297 --> 36:56.713
<i>Three goats...</i>

37:01.463 --> 37:02.505
Hey!

37:07.088 --> 37:08.630
Why don't you just let us past?

37:10.963 --> 37:12.297
Hi, Suzy.

37:14.213 --> 37:15.213
Look.

37:18.422 --> 37:20.422
This is the paradise

37:20.963 --> 37:22.755
I've told you so much about.

37:26.963 --> 37:28.463
I really miss you.

38:10.630 --> 38:11.797
Hey!

38:13.463 --> 38:14.588
There's no one here.

38:20.130 --> 38:21.297
Come on, quick!

38:32.505 --> 38:34.255
Hey! Hey!

38:34.422 --> 38:35.838
- Come on, Tocho!!
- Asshole!

38:36.172 --> 38:38.130
- Move it, Tocho!
- You asshole!

38:38.297 --> 38:39.922
Stop! Ely, tell him to stop!

38:40.088 --> 38:42.630
- Stop!
- Come on! Run!

38:42.797 --> 38:44.005
Jean Pierre!

38:48.672 --> 38:49.963
You piece of shit!

38:54.463 --> 38:56.297
We're on our way!

38:59.255 --> 39:02.588
WE MADE IT THIS FAR

39:39.380 --> 39:40.463
Africa!

39:41.880 --> 39:43.338
Here we are!

39:43.963 --> 39:45.505
A lifetime trip.

39:46.130 --> 39:47.255
Freedom!

39:49.172 --> 39:50.172
<i>Freedom...</i>

39:50.588 --> 39:52.422
<i>What a bullshit word.</i>

39:52.588 --> 39:54.588
<i>What the fuck is freedom anyway?</i>

39:54.755 --> 39:57.338
<i>Oh! I'm in Africa! I feel free!</i>

39:58.213 --> 40:00.463
<i>You're not fucking free!</i>

40:00.630 --> 40:02.338
<i>You're just a fucking idiot!</i>

40:02.880 --> 40:04.713
<i>What does the dictionary
say about freedom?</i>

40:05.838 --> 40:10.172
<i>The power to act, speak or think
as one wants,</i>

40:10.338 --> 40:12.922
<i>or doesn't want.
What a crock of shit!</i>

40:13.380 --> 40:15.172
<i>You have to go to Africa for that?</i>

40:15.755 --> 40:17.213
<i>The only freedom we have,</i>

40:18.422 --> 40:20.255
<i>is death.</i>

40:20.422 --> 40:22.255
<i>And dying is very distasteful.</i>

40:23.963 --> 40:25.213
What the fuck was that?

40:33.713 --> 40:36.672
- I don't fucking believe it!
- Please! Water!

40:37.088 --> 40:39.297
There's a black guy here
who speaks Spanish.

40:40.505 --> 40:41.985
What the hell are you doing in there?

40:42.838 --> 40:45.297
I was with the group at the military post.

40:45.463 --> 40:46.672
Well we're headed south.

40:46.963 --> 40:48.797
Europe is north.

40:50.463 --> 40:52.130
I'm going south too.

40:52.963 --> 40:53.963
To Mali.

40:55.088 --> 40:57.172
I've got no money or strength left.

40:59.088 --> 41:00.422
I'm going home.

41:00.588 --> 41:02.422
Not surprising the state Spain's in.

41:02.588 --> 41:04.297
I never made it to Spain.

41:04.463 --> 41:07.463
We'll go back to the military post
and leave him there.

41:07.630 --> 41:09.130
But we're going to the same place.

41:09.297 --> 41:11.755
This isn't a class trip!

41:12.797 --> 41:14.213
If he's not coming, neither am I.

41:16.172 --> 41:17.297
You're exaggerating.

41:17.463 --> 41:20.963
Maybe, but I bet I can annoy you
into changing your minds.

41:21.172 --> 41:23.755
Say what you like.
There isn't enough water for us all.

41:23.922 --> 41:28.380
You don't know me... I said
if he's not coming, then neither am I.

41:30.380 --> 41:31.380
Come here.

41:31.922 --> 41:32.922
Feeling better?

41:34.338 --> 41:35.838
What's your name?

41:37.005 --> 41:38.255
Mamadou.

41:39.130 --> 41:41.630
Come and get in the car with me.

41:42.547 --> 41:43.713
Come with me.

42:14.713 --> 42:15.713
Mamadou?

42:16.463 --> 42:17.463
I don't smoke.

42:17.630 --> 42:19.422
- Have a toke, man!
- Leave him alone!

42:43.630 --> 42:45.005
Ely, Mamadou,

42:45.463 --> 42:47.672
let the air out
of the back wheel.

42:57.088 --> 42:59.380
Ely, get in and start the engine.

43:03.713 --> 43:04.922
Come on, Mamadou.

43:06.630 --> 43:10.713
Ely, you have to get out of
the tire tracks! And what are you doing?

43:10.922 --> 43:13.130
Can't you push it
more than five meters?

43:13.422 --> 43:14.463
I can't...

43:14.630 --> 43:15.630
<i>Shit!</i> Come on!

43:15.755 --> 43:17.255
Come on, Mamadou,
a bit more.

43:17.463 --> 43:19.963
Come on, let's go.

43:23.047 --> 43:25.422
Shit! Not like that!
Don't take your foot

43:25.588 --> 43:28.588
- off the clutch so soon, Ely!
- Screw this!

43:29.630 --> 43:31.088
Mamadou, come on.

43:31.547 --> 43:33.338
Let them move the fucking car!

44:21.463 --> 44:22.755
Where are the flares?

44:22.963 --> 44:25.963
We've only got one
and they've already seen us!

44:36.672 --> 44:38.422
You think they've seen us?

44:39.422 --> 44:41.005
They saw us in Bilbao!

44:51.588 --> 44:52.338
<i>I'm Akly,</i>

44:52.505 --> 44:55.630
<i>from the Iferouane oasis
in the Air mountains.</i>

44:55.838 --> 44:57.963
<i>And this is Ekaley,</i>

44:58.713 --> 44:59.713
<i>my slave.</i>

45:01.672 --> 45:04.130
<i>This is Mamadou, our slave.</i>

45:04.297 --> 45:06.047
<i>Very good, Sir.</i>

45:06.297 --> 45:08.588
<i>And I'm Jean Pierre,
from Bordeaux,</i>

45:08.755 --> 45:10.588
<i>- in the south of France.</i>
- Tocho.

45:11.213 --> 45:12.005
Ely...

45:12.213 --> 45:14.255
<i>We've been stuck for hours.</i>

45:14.422 --> 45:16.547
<i>Could you give us a hand?</i>

45:17.588 --> 45:18.588
<i>My God!</i>

45:21.505 --> 45:23.422
<i>- This is a gem!
- Yes.</i>

45:23.588 --> 45:26.255
<i>Sometimes they let them
fall in the desert,</i>

45:26.422 --> 45:28.088
<i>where nobody will find them.</i>

45:28.255 --> 45:30.088
<i>What are you going to do with it?</i>

45:30.255 --> 45:33.088
<i>Sell it online.
The Americans pay a fortune for these.</i>

45:34.505 --> 45:36.005
<i>Do you want it? Sir...</i>

45:36.172 --> 45:39.547
<i>Do you want it?
I'm a five-star seller on eBay.</i>

45:39.713 --> 45:42.713
<i>Take it now
and you'll save the shipping costs.</i>

45:42.922 --> 45:46.172
<i>It's Black Friday today!</i>

45:46.588 --> 45:48.130
<i>- Black Friday?
- Yes.</i>

45:48.297 --> 45:49.713
- Bilbao...
- Hello!

45:49.922 --> 45:51.338
Hello.

45:51.505 --> 45:52.838
<i>It's a great opportunity, Sir.</i>

45:52.963 --> 45:55.505
<i>- Yes.
- This is your big chance!</i>

45:56.755 --> 45:58.297
<i>I've got no room for it.</i>

45:59.838 --> 46:02.047
- Go on, go!
<i>- Go, go!</i>

46:03.088 --> 46:06.838
<i>- Let's go, let's go.</i>
- That's it! Come on!

46:07.547 --> 46:08.588
Let's go!

46:09.505 --> 46:12.213
Go, go, go!

46:12.588 --> 46:14.463
<i>That's it! Go, go!</i>

46:19.963 --> 46:21.422
We did it!

46:22.838 --> 46:25.547
<i>Thank you!
Thank you so much!</i>

46:25.713 --> 46:27.033
<i>What can we do for you in return?</i>

46:27.130 --> 46:31.130
<i>No, no, Sir.
For us Tuaregs, helping people is normal.</i>

46:32.547 --> 46:35.297
<i>It wasn't a good idea</i>

46:35.463 --> 46:37.005
<i>to shoot the flare.</i>

46:37.172 --> 46:39.672
<i>This territory belongs to</i>

46:39.880 --> 46:40.981
<i>- Said the Scavenger.
- Excuse me!</i>

46:41.005 --> 46:45.172
<i>A Libyan bandit. I don't think
you should spend the night alone.</i>

46:45.338 --> 46:46.338
<i>Understand?</i>

46:51.922 --> 46:53.005
<i>Sir, this is for you.</i>

46:55.130 --> 46:58.297
<i>No, no, it's for you.
It's kif. Good kif.</i>

46:58.463 --> 47:00.630
<i>- It won't hurt you. It's good.</i>
- Don't be so rude.

47:00.838 --> 47:03.630
If you reject it,
the Tuareg's going to be pissed.

47:06.713 --> 47:08.547
<i>Old Trafford is amazing...</i>

47:08.713 --> 47:11.213
<i>You can't believe it
when you see it from inside.</i>

47:11.380 --> 47:14.130
<i>I was sitting right next to
Manchester United's bench!</i>

47:14.297 --> 47:16.338
<i>They let blacks in for free.</i>

47:17.088 --> 47:19.088
<i>Have you been to Chelsea's stadium?</i>

47:19.255 --> 47:21.547
<i>Yes, of course.
But it's not the same.</i>

47:21.713 --> 47:23.880
<i>They don't let blacks in?</i>

47:24.047 --> 47:26.630
<i>Yes, but you have to pay.</i>

47:39.588 --> 47:41.130
Now that really is rude!

47:41.297 --> 47:42.838
He's Muslim!

47:42.963 --> 47:46.297
I've got a friend back home
who prays while drinking wine!

47:47.463 --> 47:49.922
<i>I know why there are
no good black goalkeepers.</i>

47:50.047 --> 47:51.047
<i>Why?</i>

47:52.547 --> 47:54.047
I can't take any more of them.

47:56.005 --> 47:57.213
What are you talking about?

47:57.755 --> 47:58.755
About his master.

47:59.172 --> 48:01.838
He says he treats him really bad.

48:03.297 --> 48:04.380
Seriously?

48:04.922 --> 48:06.047
You can't imagine...

48:07.588 --> 48:10.422
The Tuaregs are assholes
who treat blacks like slaves.

48:12.213 --> 48:14.213
Ask him why he doesn't escape.

48:14.838 --> 48:15.838
OK...

48:18.213 --> 48:21.297
<i>She wants to know why
there are no good black goalkeepers.</i>

48:22.630 --> 48:25.422
<i>Goalkeepers only touch the ball
when it's flying</i>

48:25.588 --> 48:26.713
<i>straight at their heads!</i>

48:26.922 --> 48:28.297
<i>It's messed up.</i>

48:28.463 --> 48:31.172
<i>Like us blacks don't already
have enough problems.</i>

48:33.547 --> 48:36.047
He says they've got
his family working for them

48:36.213 --> 48:38.713
in the village.
If he escapes,

48:39.505 --> 48:41.630
they'll make them work
twice as hard or kill them.

48:42.047 --> 48:43.047
Shit.

48:44.255 --> 48:47.172
I'm sorry.
It's a really tricky situation...

48:49.005 --> 48:50.422
Tell him that if he needs help,

48:51.297 --> 48:52.880
he can count on me.

48:53.838 --> 48:54.838
OK.

48:55.838 --> 48:58.922
<i>She says there aren't
any black goalkeepers in Europe,</i>

48:59.047 --> 49:02.088
<i>because no white man
wants a black man behind him.</i>

49:04.255 --> 49:06.963
He says thank you.
Thank you very much.

49:17.088 --> 49:19.088
I was looking up at the sky.

49:20.172 --> 49:21.588
And I was looking at it...

49:23.755 --> 49:25.755
They landed back there.

49:26.047 --> 49:27.047
Who?

49:27.380 --> 49:28.922
The flying saucers.

49:41.338 --> 49:43.588
Ready to invade Africa.

49:43.755 --> 49:45.505
- For Africa.
- Yeah.

49:45.880 --> 49:47.880
You need another dump?

49:48.005 --> 49:50.463
- French fertilizer for the desert.
- Wait here.

49:50.630 --> 49:53.255
- How many were there?
- Forty invisible UFOs.

49:53.422 --> 49:54.922
- How many were left?
- Thirty nine.

50:00.005 --> 50:01.005
<i>Thanks.</i>

50:03.672 --> 50:04.672
<i>Thanks.</i>

50:06.672 --> 50:08.172
<i>- You want some?</i>
- Smoke!

50:08.880 --> 50:13.213
- Look! It appears and disappears.
- Like the UFOs.

50:18.088 --> 50:19.463
They were flying saucers.

50:25.963 --> 50:27.463
<i>I can't smoke any more.</i>

50:31.963 --> 50:33.047
Tocho.

51:03.255 --> 51:04.255
Tocho!

51:04.630 --> 51:05.630
Jean Pierre!

51:05.838 --> 51:07.547
- Wake up! They've robbed us!
- What?

51:07.713 --> 51:08.838
Robbed?

51:09.755 --> 51:10.755
Who?

51:17.713 --> 51:20.880
They've taken all the money!
And my gin! And my tobacco!

51:21.630 --> 51:23.755
Wasn't that asshole a Muslim?

51:25.422 --> 51:27.338
They've taken our passports.

51:29.630 --> 51:30.755
They've taken everything.

51:31.047 --> 51:32.630
Now we're all illegal.

51:32.838 --> 51:35.213
At least they left us some gas, water

51:35.963 --> 51:37.505
and a couple of tins of sardines.

51:37.588 --> 51:39.172
We can make it to the border with that.

51:39.338 --> 51:44.005
The asshole! My backpack!
When I find him I'm going to kill him!

51:44.172 --> 51:48.838
I'm going to rip his head off
and put it on a fucking stick!

51:49.505 --> 51:51.963
Fuck you!
No...

51:52.130 --> 51:53.130
No!

51:53.463 --> 51:55.963
You fucking Tuareg piece of shit!

51:56.005 --> 52:00.338
I'm going to fucking kill you
and stick your turban up your ass!

52:00.880 --> 52:05.505
When I find him he'd better pray,
'cos I'm going to fuck him up!

52:23.547 --> 52:25.547
- Ely! Stop, stop!
- Again?

52:25.713 --> 52:28.880
No, you're right.
I'll just do it in here.

52:29.005 --> 52:30.255
Stop!

52:32.713 --> 52:33.797
For fuck's sake!

52:34.547 --> 52:37.047
You shouldn't have drunk water
from a goat-skin bottle!

52:37.213 --> 52:39.130
What's the soldiers' water
got to do with it?

52:39.297 --> 52:42.172
It was that shit
you made me smoke last night.

52:42.338 --> 52:44.672
If you took more drugs,
this wouldn't happen to you.

52:46.255 --> 52:48.922
I feel terrible.

52:58.963 --> 52:59.963
Shit!

53:00.255 --> 53:03.630
- Shit! The exhaust pipe fell off.
- Fuck the exhaust pipe!

53:21.755 --> 53:22.755
Shit!

53:27.297 --> 53:29.672
We need to pour water on the radiator.

53:30.088 --> 53:31.963
But we've only got two bottles left.

53:32.130 --> 53:34.713
I've lost my gin already today.
I'm not losing my water too.

53:34.838 --> 53:36.297
If we don't pour water on it,

53:37.005 --> 53:38.213
we're not going anywhere.

53:39.338 --> 53:40.505
What are you doing Mamadou?

53:44.172 --> 53:45.172
What are you doing?

53:45.255 --> 53:46.963
This is an African remedy.

53:54.547 --> 53:57.213
You can't piss on the radiator.

54:02.505 --> 54:03.547
Oh, Tocho!

54:05.880 --> 54:06.963
Johnny!

54:07.880 --> 54:09.672
Don't you need a piss?

54:17.172 --> 54:20.630
I told you.
You can't piss on a car radiator.

54:20.963 --> 54:22.422
The problem's not the radiator.

54:22.588 --> 54:25.672
I know it's not,
but I'm saying you can't piss on it.

54:25.880 --> 54:29.922
If it was for pissing on,
they'd have put a toilet there.

54:30.172 --> 54:32.213
And you could really use a toilet!

54:43.297 --> 54:44.672
- Tocho!
- What?

54:44.880 --> 54:46.588
Pass me that stone over there.

54:55.963 --> 54:57.297
- Ely?
- What?

54:57.463 --> 54:59.005
Do you have a hairband?

54:59.172 --> 55:01.255
- Yeah.
- Are you going to listen to a guy

55:01.422 --> 55:03.297
who fixes cars by pissing on them?

55:03.713 --> 55:05.513
Do you have cotton wool,
or something spongey?

55:06.380 --> 55:08.922
I need to stop
this small oil leak.

55:11.463 --> 55:13.880
I've got this. Will this work?

55:14.130 --> 55:16.380
Piss and tampons!

55:16.963 --> 55:20.255
What an engineer!
NASA is missing out!

55:20.338 --> 55:23.047
- Ely, try the engine.
- OK!

55:25.963 --> 55:28.505
We should have left him
at the military post.

55:29.047 --> 55:32.588
All he does is use up food and water.

55:42.588 --> 55:43.963
You're such a dick!

55:44.130 --> 55:45.922
You haven't changed in 30 years.

55:46.838 --> 55:47.838
Jerk!

55:53.713 --> 55:54.963
That guy's an idiot...

55:56.338 --> 55:57.463
It's OK.

55:58.505 --> 56:00.088
He doesn't feel well.

56:06.338 --> 56:08.297
You must be dying to get home.

56:10.005 --> 56:11.880
They had a collection for me
in my village,

56:12.005 --> 56:14.130
to pay for me to get to Europe

56:14.505 --> 56:16.547
and send money back home.

56:17.922 --> 56:19.588
I can't go back with nothing.

56:21.005 --> 56:22.463
I feel like a failure.

56:25.047 --> 56:26.172
Don't worry.

56:27.255 --> 56:29.047
We're all failures.

56:29.630 --> 56:31.338
At least you tried.

56:35.880 --> 56:37.588
How did you get those scars?

56:39.297 --> 56:40.880
Trying to cross over into Spain...

56:43.047 --> 56:45.630
Once by raft
and five times at the fence in Melilla.

56:46.338 --> 56:48.713
The last time
I got stuck on the barbed wire.

56:51.755 --> 56:53.838
That's when I decided to go home.

56:57.422 --> 56:59.297
You can't trust people with scars.

57:02.713 --> 57:04.213
Don't you have any?

57:06.088 --> 57:07.088
Yeah,

57:07.880 --> 57:09.297
but you can't see them.

57:11.547 --> 57:12.838
Take your shoes off.

57:14.380 --> 57:15.422
What?

57:15.672 --> 57:17.547
Do me a favor
and take your shoes off.

57:25.963 --> 57:28.880
Did you know love for the earth
enters through the soles of our feet?

57:31.672 --> 57:32.963
Raise your hands.

57:38.713 --> 57:40.172
And close your eyes.

57:45.588 --> 57:48.505
Feel the weight of your body
in the soles of your feet.

57:50.005 --> 57:52.338
Can you feel
they're connected to the earth?

57:54.088 --> 57:55.213
What can you feel?

57:58.630 --> 57:59.630
Heat.

57:59.963 --> 58:01.297
What do you mean heat?

58:02.338 --> 58:03.463
I feel heat.

58:03.630 --> 58:06.672
Can't you feel the earth's energy
coming through the soles of your feet?

58:08.088 --> 58:10.422
For that I'd have to smoke
all of Tocho's hash!

58:10.588 --> 58:13.297
Africa! Can't you feel Africa?

58:14.130 --> 58:16.088
You're nuts, Mamadou!

58:17.297 --> 58:18.547
You... Crazy girl!

58:33.213 --> 58:35.088
What the hell are you doing?

58:35.630 --> 58:37.588
I'm so thirsty!

58:37.755 --> 58:39.422
Deal with it like the rest of us!

58:40.130 --> 58:41.297
I'm dying!

58:41.463 --> 58:43.338
I could kill you right now!

58:43.963 --> 58:46.880
Don't tell my wife I died of diarrhea.

58:47.005 --> 58:51.130
Tell her a Tuareg killed me
or that I sacrificed myself for you.

58:51.297 --> 58:53.088
You're not going to fucking die!

58:53.463 --> 58:55.255
How can you be so sure?

58:58.588 --> 59:00.172
It's my fault you're here.

59:05.088 --> 59:06.672
I'd never forgive myself.

59:06.755 --> 59:08.588
- Come on.
- OK.

59:17.338 --> 59:19.505
That's eight for me.

59:21.672 --> 59:22.672
Take that!

59:27.130 --> 59:28.713
Do you regret coming?

59:29.922 --> 59:30.963
No.

59:33.172 --> 59:34.588
I dreamt of this trip.

59:36.463 --> 59:39.463
Since I was little,
Dad told me stories about...

59:40.213 --> 59:42.255
all your trips across the desert.

59:43.755 --> 59:46.630
He always said when I turned 18,
that would be my gift.

59:52.047 --> 59:53.287
I'm not sure I want to see him.

59:58.713 --> 59:59.713
Look at me.

01:00:01.005 --> 01:00:02.005
Look at me.

01:00:03.172 --> 01:00:04.963
Joseba's the best guy
I've ever laid eyes on.

01:00:05.672 --> 01:00:06.422
Yeah...

01:00:06.588 --> 01:00:09.630
His heart, and his balls,
are as big as this desert.

01:00:15.005 --> 01:00:16.047
Have you got kids?

01:00:16.213 --> 01:00:17.463
You're joking, right?

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:18.630
What?

01:00:18.838 --> 01:00:21.297
The world's got
enough assholes already.

01:00:22.338 --> 01:00:23.380
A wife?

01:00:24.088 --> 01:00:25.172
Girlfriend?

01:00:25.672 --> 01:00:26.672
Anything?

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:35.755
What are you going to do after this trip?

01:00:36.963 --> 01:00:39.755
Old ladies don't make plans
for the future.

01:00:40.963 --> 01:00:42.422
They just talk about the past.

01:00:46.588 --> 01:00:47.963
Come on! We're leaving!

01:00:49.588 --> 01:00:51.422
That's my boy, Mamadou!

01:01:13.172 --> 01:01:14.172
Ely,

01:01:14.213 --> 01:01:16.463
stop, stop.

01:01:16.797 --> 01:01:17.797
Stop!

01:01:18.672 --> 01:01:20.005
But we're almost there...

01:01:22.088 --> 01:01:23.630
I can't go in there.

01:01:24.547 --> 01:01:26.088
You're going in, like it or not!

01:01:26.255 --> 01:01:27.880
There's water, gas...
everything we need.

01:01:28.922 --> 01:01:29.922
Alain...

01:01:30.672 --> 01:01:31.797
No fucking way!

01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:34.588
That fucking frog's still here?

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.463
The soldier told me.

01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:38.213
Who's that?

01:01:38.588 --> 01:01:39.713
Some frog...

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:42.213
They say he came here
to escape the law.

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:44.963
He does business with crazy people like us
and he built a hostel

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:46.422
on the ruins of "Oil Drum 5”.

01:01:46.672 --> 01:01:49.547
In two years he was
the biggest trafficker in the Tanezrouft.

01:01:49.713 --> 01:01:50.755
Are you in shit with him?

01:01:50.922 --> 01:01:51.588
No.

01:01:51.755 --> 01:01:52.797
Yes...

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:56.963
What?

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:58.380
I don't believe this!

01:01:58.547 --> 01:02:03.463
My last trip, I was part of a convoy
of five tank trucks

01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:06.255
carrying gas.

01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:07.672
They were Alain's.

01:02:07.922 --> 01:02:10.005
We were supposed
to sell them in Niger.

01:02:10.463 --> 01:02:15.505
I took one of the trucks
and went to Mali. I sold it in Bamako.

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:21.338
For fuck's sake, Jean Pierre!

01:02:21.755 --> 01:02:24.130
Who in their right mind
steals a truck from Alain?

01:02:24.672 --> 01:02:25.922
I wanted to retire.

01:02:26.088 --> 01:02:30.422
I wanted to buy a vineyard
and make my own wine.

01:02:30.588 --> 01:02:31.963
Why didn't you say before?

01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:34.422
When the soldier said
Alain was still alive,

01:02:34.588 --> 01:02:36.463
I thought we could go another way

01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:38.380
and avoid him, but...

01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:41.547
getting robbed screwed up my plan.

01:02:41.838 --> 01:02:43.088
So what now?

01:02:43.255 --> 01:02:44.935
If we go in there,
the frog might kill him.

01:02:44.963 --> 01:02:45.713
Then what?

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.922
If we don't,
he's going to die for sure.

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:50.422
I want to die with you.

01:02:50.588 --> 01:02:52.314
When we get back,
I'm going to stick your vines

01:02:52.338 --> 01:02:54.297
up your fucking ass
'til you shit wine!

01:02:55.672 --> 01:02:56.963
What are we going to do?

01:02:58.963 --> 01:03:00.130
Find a way out of this,

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:02.338
that's what we're going to do.

01:03:24.338 --> 01:03:25.338
Here.

01:03:30.047 --> 01:03:31.213
Come on!

01:03:32.547 --> 01:03:33.547
Go, go!

01:03:41.713 --> 01:03:43.130
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

01:03:43.297 --> 01:03:44.963
Works wonders for a fever.

01:03:45.963 --> 01:03:47.255
Where are you going?

01:03:47.755 --> 01:03:50.172
To get gas,
we can't stay here too long.

01:03:50.338 --> 01:03:51.463
What if someone comes?

01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:53.630
You punch them
as hard as you can, OK?

01:03:53.797 --> 01:03:54.797
OK.

01:03:55.088 --> 01:03:56.630
Mamadou, close the door.

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.838
<i>Welcome to "Oil Drum 5".</i>

01:04:16.005 --> 01:04:17.880
<i>I'm Alain, the owner.</i>

01:04:18.797 --> 01:04:19.880
Thank you...<i> Merci beacoup.</i>

01:04:20.047 --> 01:04:21.588
Ah, Spanish.

01:04:23.755 --> 01:04:24.797
Nice car!

01:04:25.213 --> 01:04:27.630
She's a beauty.
Where'd you get her?

01:04:27.838 --> 01:04:30.672
From the first Paris-Dakar...
or the second?

01:04:30.838 --> 01:04:31.838
First.

01:04:32.588 --> 01:04:33.797
She's a beauty alright...

01:04:34.297 --> 01:04:35.297
But she's a copy.

01:04:35.463 --> 01:04:36.963
Not worth anything.

01:04:37.172 --> 01:04:38.672
And that piece of junk?

01:04:39.255 --> 01:04:42.380
A satellite...
It was a gift from a Tuareg.

01:04:42.547 --> 01:04:46.005
It's seen more of the desert
than it has of space!

01:04:54.047 --> 01:04:55.505
Your face...

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.172
Have we met before?

01:05:00.838 --> 01:05:01.838
No, I don't think so.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:03.880
I'd remember.

01:05:04.505 --> 01:05:07.463
You used to come here with that Spanish
guy who was always fucked up...

01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:09.588
and a Frenchman, Jean Pierre.

01:05:10.255 --> 01:05:11.630
And your name was...

01:05:13.297 --> 01:05:14.463
Tocho.

01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:15.630
Tocho!

01:05:15.797 --> 01:05:19.005
<i>My God!</i> Tocho. That's it!
And the other guy was...

01:05:19.338 --> 01:05:21.005
- His name?
- Joseba?

01:05:21.172 --> 01:05:24.338
Joseba! I remember him perfectly!

01:05:24.505 --> 01:05:26.380
- He was ugly as sin!
- Yeah!

01:05:26.547 --> 01:05:28.213
- He was an ugly fucker, yeah!
- So ugly!

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:29.713
- Yeah.
- Yes.

01:05:31.547 --> 01:05:34.255
How's Jean Pierre?

01:05:35.005 --> 01:05:36.005
Jean Pierre?

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:39.797
I haven't heard from him in years.

01:05:39.963 --> 01:05:41.755
He went back to France,
that's all I know.

01:05:42.547 --> 01:05:45.463
I didn't like him.
He wasn't trustworthy.

01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:46.630
Strange guy...

01:05:46.755 --> 01:05:49.463
- Yeah.
- Always so elegant with his scarf...

01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:51.047
- Yeah.
- Where are you headed?

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:52.838
Up? Down?

01:05:53.005 --> 01:05:54.380
We're headed south.

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.213
Ah, so then...
You're not alone?

01:05:59.713 --> 01:06:00.922
Who are you with?

01:06:01.088 --> 01:06:04.213
A black kid from Mali we found
on the way, and Joseba's daughter.

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:06.755
- Joseba's daughter?
- Yes.

01:06:07.047 --> 01:06:08.273
She's not as ugly as her old man!

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:10.297
I'd love to meet her!

01:06:10.713 --> 01:06:12.380
<i>- OK.
- OK.</i>

01:06:12.797 --> 01:06:13.588
Alain?

01:06:13.755 --> 01:06:14.880
- Alain.
- Alain.

01:06:15.047 --> 01:06:16.047
Alain.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:17.880
Tocho!

01:06:23.338 --> 01:06:24.463
Good morning!

01:06:32.838 --> 01:06:35.005
What the fuck was that?

01:06:37.505 --> 01:06:39.338
I did what you told me to!

01:06:39.505 --> 01:06:41.172
- Alain's here.
- What?

01:06:41.338 --> 01:06:43.588
- Fuck!
- What did he say?

01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:45.672
The asshole was all charm.

01:06:45.838 --> 01:06:47.130
He asked about Jean Pierre.

01:06:47.297 --> 01:06:48.297
Does he know he's here?

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:49.672
No, he hasn't seen him.

01:06:50.088 --> 01:06:51.088
Is he any better?

01:06:52.088 --> 01:06:52.797
No.

01:06:52.963 --> 01:06:54.380
Better than if Alain sees him.

01:06:56.755 --> 01:06:57.755
It's OK.

01:06:58.255 --> 01:07:00.130
I'm going to buy gas
and get you out of here.

01:07:00.297 --> 01:07:03.047
- I love you!
- Fuck!

01:07:03.922 --> 01:07:05.380
He's delirious.

01:07:18.047 --> 01:07:20.672
<i>Hey, Mr. Tocho.</i>
Want a beer?

01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:23.047
- I'm in a hurry.
- Nice and cold.

01:07:23.213 --> 01:07:25.630
Sit down, it's on me. Sit down.

01:07:28.338 --> 01:07:29.338
<i>So...</i>

01:07:34.255 --> 01:07:37.547
Perhaps your friends would like a beer?
It's on me.

01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:40.547
Thanks but they're resting.

01:07:42.172 --> 01:07:43.213
Cheers.

01:07:45.713 --> 01:07:47.963
I would've liked
to meet Joseba's daughter.

01:07:49.005 --> 01:07:50.297
What a great guy!

01:07:50.755 --> 01:07:53.172
He always drank
all the beer, the bastard!

01:07:54.172 --> 01:07:56.130
Beer goes down a treat here.

01:07:57.505 --> 01:07:59.130
The other one's here, isn't here?

01:08:00.338 --> 01:08:02.088
The one who's always sick.

01:08:04.755 --> 01:08:06.505
Did you forget to mention him?

01:08:06.672 --> 01:08:09.130
I told you one of us was sick,
that's why I'm in a rush.

01:08:09.713 --> 01:08:11.172
Do you know Martial?

01:08:11.338 --> 01:08:13.797
You saw him.
The black guy who was with me.

01:08:14.505 --> 01:08:16.130
Martial's speciality

01:08:16.296 --> 01:08:17.462
is pissing

01:08:18.005 --> 01:08:20.587
on people's necks
as they bleed to death.

01:08:21.462 --> 01:08:23.130
So, I wonder...

01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:25.630
Do you think
he feels like pissing now?

01:08:26.212 --> 01:08:27.337
I don't know.

01:08:28.005 --> 01:08:29.671
Has he drunk a lot of beer?

01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:31.380
Don't fuck with me,

01:08:33.255 --> 01:08:36.337
or I'll send Martial
to deal with Jean Pierre

01:08:37.087 --> 01:08:39.337
and I'll take care of you myself.

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:42.380
<i>Understood?</i>

01:08:43.171 --> 01:08:44.212
I just want to know

01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:47.421
<i>why you, my friend,</i>

01:08:47.921 --> 01:08:50.130
didn't tell me
Jean Pierre was with you.

01:08:51.046 --> 01:08:52.671
He told us about the tank truck.

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:53.837
And what do you think?

01:08:54.212 --> 01:08:55.712
- Terrible.
- Extremely.

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.712
I fucking told him! I said:

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.200
"Jean Pierre, you can't do that
to a great guy like Alain?"

01:09:00.962 --> 01:09:03.712
He really regrets it.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:06.046
And how can we fix it?

01:09:07.505 --> 01:09:09.046
How much are we talking?

01:09:09.546 --> 01:09:11.130
Fifty thousand.

01:09:11.296 --> 01:09:12.546
That's a lot of money.

01:09:13.712 --> 01:09:16.130
- The car then.
- The car's Joseba's.

01:09:16.296 --> 01:09:18.755
Keep the satellite.
I heard it's worth a fortune.

01:09:20.337 --> 01:09:22.380
There is one more option...

01:09:24.337 --> 01:09:26.296
You stay here and never leave.

01:09:35.755 --> 01:09:36.880
For fuck's sake!

01:09:37.587 --> 01:09:39.837
He's getting worse.
He needs a doctor.

01:09:40.837 --> 01:09:42.671
I don't fucking believe this!

01:09:42.837 --> 01:09:43.921
What is it?

01:09:44.587 --> 01:09:46.171
He wants 50 grand...
Or the car.

01:09:46.337 --> 01:09:48.087
No fucking way!
That car's my dad's!

01:09:48.255 --> 01:09:50.587
- Keep your voice down!
- We brought the car here for him.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.130
We're not giving him the car.

01:09:55.297 --> 01:09:56.297
Jean Pierre.

01:09:56.547 --> 01:09:59.005
Jean Pierre!
How much money have you got?

01:10:00.213 --> 01:10:01.338
Get me out of here, please.

01:10:01.505 --> 01:10:03.255
I need to know
how much money you've got.

01:10:03.422 --> 01:10:04.630
I don't know...

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.547
Fifty grand?

01:10:07.255 --> 01:10:10.047
- I've never had that much.
- Whatever you've got then.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.088
I'm not giving that asshole any money!

01:10:14.588 --> 01:10:16.005
The car then.

01:10:16.213 --> 01:10:17.880
Not a chance!

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.547
Fuck, Jean Pierre!
We have to give him something!

01:10:22.547 --> 01:10:24.380
Give him...

01:10:25.505 --> 01:10:26.588
the satellite.

01:10:31.755 --> 01:10:33.505
Give him the satellite.

01:10:43.922 --> 01:10:45.297
What the fuck's he doing here?

01:10:45.505 --> 01:10:47.130
Who is it?

01:10:47.297 --> 01:10:49.137
The guy who's going to
get us out of this dump.

01:10:49.297 --> 01:10:51.880
If it isn't my favorite Bedouins!

01:10:52.047 --> 01:10:54.547
- Who'd have thought?
- I don't believe it!

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.630
Hey! Was that really necessary?

01:11:00.797 --> 01:11:02.672
- I need your help.
- Oh, sure.

01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:04.672
You're fucking joking!

01:11:04.838 --> 01:11:06.672
I'm not lifting a finger for that asshole.

01:11:07.088 --> 01:11:08.297
Then do it for me.

01:11:08.505 --> 01:11:11.172
You abandoned me, Tocho, like a rat.

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:12.797
That's hard to forget.

01:11:14.463 --> 01:11:16.588
Tocho. Get me out of here.

01:11:16.755 --> 01:11:19.172
I need you to set up a party.

01:11:19.547 --> 01:11:21.797
- What the hell?
- Is this enough?

01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:27.130
Well...

01:11:27.338 --> 01:11:31.713
If it's with this fucker's money,
I'll organize a fucking parade!

01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:34.422
That's what I'm talking about, man!

01:13:06.672 --> 01:13:10.713
OK, guys! Who do we have to push
through the window?

01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:13.713
It's like they say on Mars,

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:16.047
- I went to buy a guitar.
- Give us a kiss!

01:13:16.213 --> 01:13:17.338
- Dude!
- Give me a hand.

01:13:17.505 --> 01:13:19.213
- Give me a kiss.
- Fucking give me a hand!

01:13:19.713 --> 01:13:21.505
You really think Tutankhamen

01:13:21.672 --> 01:13:24.231
- is going to fit through the window?
- Stop fucking about! Help us!

01:13:24.255 --> 01:13:25.255
Come on!

01:13:25.338 --> 01:13:27.547
- I want some of what he's had!
- Let's go!

01:13:31.463 --> 01:13:33.755
Fuck, Soriano, come on!

01:13:35.255 --> 01:13:36.880
- Son of a...
- Shit!

01:13:37.797 --> 01:13:39.380
Watch his head!

01:13:40.088 --> 01:13:42.047
Stop! He's going to fall! Stop!

01:13:42.172 --> 01:13:43.172
Let me go.

01:13:46.505 --> 01:13:48.213
Well, that hurt!

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:55.505
Come on, push!

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:04.463
Start the engine!

01:14:07.213 --> 01:14:08.963
Foot on the clutch
and second gear!

01:14:10.963 --> 01:14:12.255
Let go of the clutch!

01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:25.172
Dude... I really owe you one!

01:14:34.338 --> 01:14:37.630
Yup... I think I'm a little bit wasted.

01:14:38.838 --> 01:14:40.005
Just a little bit.

01:15:38.255 --> 01:15:41.213
In 20 kilometers
there's a trafficker's route.

01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:43.713
If we go that way,
Alain won't find us.

01:16:19.047 --> 01:16:20.672
Fuck me!

01:17:05.172 --> 01:17:07.547
- My stomach hurts.
- Deal with it!

01:17:08.463 --> 01:17:09.463
Come on!

01:17:19.588 --> 01:17:22.922
We have to get out of here
before that bastard finds us.

01:17:23.588 --> 01:17:24.588
Don't worry.

01:17:24.755 --> 01:17:27.422
We're far enough away
from the main road.

01:17:30.338 --> 01:17:32.047
If nobody comes tomorrow,

01:17:33.005 --> 01:17:35.922
we'll have to find help
on the traffickers' route.

01:17:36.088 --> 01:17:38.797
Yeah, but Jean can't move.

01:17:41.338 --> 01:17:42.713
I'll go alone.

01:17:46.797 --> 01:17:47.797
No.

01:17:49.213 --> 01:17:50.963
You're not going anywhere.

01:17:52.755 --> 01:17:54.380
We have enough water
for two days.

01:17:55.963 --> 01:17:58.463
This is what happens in the desert.

01:18:00.713 --> 01:18:02.797
Something happens
at the last minute

01:18:03.463 --> 01:18:05.130
and you get another chance.

01:18:10.463 --> 01:18:11.672
You know what?

01:18:12.547 --> 01:18:13.588
What?

01:18:16.255 --> 01:18:17.672
You were right.

01:18:18.505 --> 01:18:19.922
Right about what?

01:18:23.255 --> 01:18:24.588
I can feel it now.

01:18:26.422 --> 01:18:27.755
What can you feel?

01:18:28.505 --> 01:18:29.547
Africa.

01:18:32.047 --> 01:18:33.255
I can feel Africa.

01:20:57.338 --> 01:20:58.338
Where's Mamadou?

01:20:59.505 --> 01:21:00.505
Isn't he with you?

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:09.047
Mamadou!

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.130
Mamadou!

01:21:16.172 --> 01:21:17.297
He's not here.

01:21:18.463 --> 01:21:20.255
- He's not here!
- What do you mean?

01:21:20.505 --> 01:21:22.088
Where could he have gone?

01:21:22.255 --> 01:21:23.630
To get help.
He told me last night.

01:21:24.963 --> 01:21:26.588
He's going to die.

01:21:28.672 --> 01:21:29.838
Mamadou!

01:21:31.588 --> 01:21:32.588
No...

01:21:34.755 --> 01:21:35.755
Ely!

01:21:37.172 --> 01:21:38.630
Ely!

01:21:41.755 --> 01:21:42.797
What are you doing?

01:21:44.922 --> 01:21:46.630
Fuck!

01:21:47.213 --> 01:21:48.963
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:21:49.630 --> 01:21:50.213
Fuck!

01:21:50.588 --> 01:21:53.047
No! No! No!

01:21:56.213 --> 01:21:57.255
It's OK.

01:21:58.755 --> 01:21:59.838
It's OK.

01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:06.755
Drink.

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:31.672
Jean Pierre?

01:23:32.213 --> 01:23:34.172
Jean Pierre?
Drink some water.

01:23:34.922 --> 01:23:35.963
Come on.

01:24:20.130 --> 01:24:21.588
What are we going to do?

01:24:23.672 --> 01:24:25.880
- What do you suggest?
- I don't know.

01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:27.713
Something...

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.672
You're the experts.

01:24:31.338 --> 01:24:33.963
We've got no more water.
We have to wait.

01:24:46.172 --> 01:24:47.255
What are you doing?

01:24:49.338 --> 01:24:50.838
You can't set light to a tire.

01:24:52.088 --> 01:24:53.088
Why not?

01:24:57.463 --> 01:24:58.130
Alain...

01:24:58.297 --> 01:25:00.838
If Alain doesn't kill us, the desert will.

01:25:02.588 --> 01:25:03.713
Don't do it.

01:26:35.172 --> 01:26:37.963
I told you the tire wouldn't work.

01:26:51.255 --> 01:26:53.463
Hi! Yakimoto! Yakimoto.

01:26:55.713 --> 01:26:56.922
We've broken down.

01:26:57.463 --> 01:26:58.505
Kaput.

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:00.047
Kaput.

01:27:01.505 --> 01:27:02.963
Yes, yes. English, English.

01:27:04.130 --> 01:27:08.047
Do you see black man walking <i> solo</i>
in the desert?

01:27:16.713 --> 01:27:18.463
- OK.
- The car!

01:27:18.630 --> 01:27:19.630
Tell him about the car!

01:27:44.797 --> 01:27:47.422
<i>These pieces of shit French cars!</i>

01:27:48.463 --> 01:27:50.422
<i>Crossing the Sahara
in this heap of junk!</i>

01:27:53.297 --> 01:27:56.047
<i>If they had a Toyota Land Cruiser,</i>

01:27:56.213 --> 01:27:59.963
<i>I wouldn't be here
getting my hands dirty.</i>

01:28:19.588 --> 01:28:22.297
<i>Who put this there?</i>

01:28:24.505 --> 01:28:26.213
<i>You got the wrong hole!</i>

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:30.880
I strongly admire your culture.

01:28:31.005 --> 01:28:33.463
My first watch was a Casio Digital
with two buttons.

01:30:44.505 --> 01:30:45.505
My sarong.

01:30:45.547 --> 01:30:46.588
My sarong!

01:30:58.005 --> 01:30:59.172
Mamadou...

01:31:00.047 --> 01:31:02.005
Mamadou. Water.

01:31:05.047 --> 01:31:06.088
Water!

01:31:13.713 --> 01:31:14.713
Hey!

01:31:15.963 --> 01:31:17.047
Hey, wake up.

01:31:18.005 --> 01:31:19.047
Come on.

01:31:19.547 --> 01:31:21.130
No, no, no!

01:31:22.047 --> 01:31:23.297
Wake up.

01:31:39.255 --> 01:31:40.255
No!

01:31:43.547 --> 01:31:44.547
No!

01:33:44.130 --> 01:33:45.255
Tocho?

01:33:46.088 --> 01:33:47.088
Maimouna.

01:33:49.422 --> 01:33:50.588
I'm Jean Pierre.

01:33:50.797 --> 01:33:52.172
Jean Pierre?

01:33:53.005 --> 01:33:54.255
Did we make it on time?

01:33:54.588 --> 01:33:55.922
More or less.

01:33:56.255 --> 01:33:57.588
- Come in.
- Excuse me.

01:34:01.963 --> 01:34:03.005
You're...

01:34:34.630 --> 01:34:35.755
Look, Ely.

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:39.320
Me and your dad in our neighborhood.

01:34:45.088 --> 01:34:46.088
Thank you.

01:34:46.422 --> 01:34:47.630
Thank you.

01:34:50.255 --> 01:34:51.547
Did he know we were coming?

01:34:51.755 --> 01:34:53.172
No, I didn't tell him.

01:34:53.338 --> 01:34:57.547
I didn't know if you'd received my letter,
or if you'd come.

01:35:13.838 --> 01:35:14.963
Joseba.

01:35:16.047 --> 01:35:17.255
Joseba...

01:35:19.505 --> 01:35:20.630
Joseba...

01:35:22.463 --> 01:35:24.505
- What is it?
- Look who's here.

01:35:29.922 --> 01:35:30.963
No way!

01:35:32.963 --> 01:35:33.963
Tocho!

01:35:34.463 --> 01:35:35.588
Joseba!

01:35:39.005 --> 01:35:41.172
Tocho! I'll be damned!

01:35:43.088 --> 01:35:44.505
Looking good, asshole!

01:35:44.713 --> 01:35:46.130
As if I'd believe that!

01:35:46.630 --> 01:35:48.047
I'm a liar too!

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:49.963
- Jean Pierre.
- Joseba.

01:35:50.088 --> 01:35:51.213
Jean Pierre.

01:35:54.922 --> 01:35:55.963
Joseba.

01:35:57.213 --> 01:35:58.380
Your nose got bigger.

01:36:00.963 --> 01:36:02.130
Still an asshole!

01:36:19.838 --> 01:36:20.838
God damn!

01:36:29.088 --> 01:36:30.463
You're beautiful!

01:36:32.547 --> 01:36:33.630
Forgive me!

01:36:34.505 --> 01:36:35.797
Forgive me!

01:36:36.922 --> 01:36:39.380
- It's OK.
- No, it's not. We have to talk.

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.088
Look... Look what I brought you.

01:36:47.588 --> 01:36:48.630
The diary.

01:36:49.505 --> 01:36:51.463
It's the only thing
I left you, isn't it?

01:37:15.422 --> 01:37:16.922
I'm going to call the embassy.

01:37:18.922 --> 01:37:20.130
The embassy? What for?

01:37:20.922 --> 01:37:22.130
They're obliged to help us.

01:37:23.713 --> 01:37:25.172
We can get him out of here tomorrow.

01:37:25.338 --> 01:37:27.178
In two days he'll be
in Spain having treatment.

01:37:27.588 --> 01:37:31.838
Or we could take him to Paris.
I know a private clinic.

01:37:31.963 --> 01:37:33.130
Didn't you hear what he said?

01:37:33.297 --> 01:37:34.588
What did you expect?

01:37:35.463 --> 01:37:36.797
He's too fucking proud.

01:37:36.963 --> 01:37:40.047
He said he didn't have any money
to go back to Spain with.

01:37:41.005 --> 01:37:42.463
He said he didn't want to die

01:37:42.630 --> 01:37:44.880
in a hospital in Madrid,
far away from his wife.

01:37:45.130 --> 01:37:46.963
His wife could come to.

01:37:47.422 --> 01:37:50.005
Joseba wants to die here.

01:37:50.297 --> 01:37:52.130
Joseba doesn't want to die.

01:37:55.088 --> 01:37:56.547
He's not going to die.

01:38:17.088 --> 01:38:18.547
Joseba doesn't want to die.

01:38:22.255 --> 01:38:23.755
No one wants to die.

01:38:25.172 --> 01:38:27.047
But we have to respect his decision.

01:38:41.130 --> 01:38:42.547
Wow!

01:38:50.797 --> 01:38:52.797
You're like fucking Fitzcarraldo!

01:38:52.963 --> 01:38:57.380
All you need is the gramophone,
the Indians, the children and the opera.

01:38:57.547 --> 01:38:59.588
It hasn't moved for a year.

01:38:59.922 --> 01:39:02.172
You think it could
still be a good business?

01:39:02.338 --> 01:39:03.422
Don't doubt it.

01:39:04.422 --> 01:39:07.005
It's the only one
on the river that can carry

01:39:07.172 --> 01:39:08.922
five times as much weight
as the others.

01:39:09.047 --> 01:39:11.588
How much would it cost
to get it running again?

01:39:11.797 --> 01:39:15.422
Around 25,000 euros, but...

01:39:15.588 --> 01:39:19.588
the problem is that it's hard work,
and I don't have the strength anymore.

01:39:22.505 --> 01:39:23.713
But I do.

01:39:26.713 --> 01:39:28.213
You want to take the boat?

01:39:28.630 --> 01:39:29.630
No,

01:39:30.713 --> 01:39:32.255
I want to stay here with you

01:39:33.963 --> 01:39:35.422
and fix it up together.

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.297
I want to stay too.

01:39:39.630 --> 01:39:42.213
And I can finance the repairs.

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:52.505
Jean Pierre, Tocho, come here.

01:40:53.672 --> 01:40:56.797
<i>People love the desert,
and I'm not saying it's a bad place,</i>

01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:02.505
<i>but if you analyze it objectively,
it's basically a pain in the ass.</i>

01:41:03.297 --> 01:41:07.422
<i>Your shoes are always full of sand,
and it's hotter than Hell.</i>

01:41:08.213 --> 01:41:13.422
<i>I doubt Saint-Exupéry and all those guys
have been here in their fucking lives!</i>

01:41:14.797 --> 01:41:17.547
<i>I don't know
where they got their information from,</i>

01:41:17.672 --> 01:41:21.172
<i>but I think they were very wrong.</i>

01:41:21.255 --> 01:41:22.880
<i>And hey, let's not kid ourselves,</i>

01:41:23.547 --> 01:41:25.338
<i>the desert is like a beach,</i>

01:41:25.422 --> 01:41:28.422
<i>but without girls in bikinis
or beach bars.</i>

01:41:29.422 --> 01:41:31.755
<i>And the water
a fucking million miles away...</i>
