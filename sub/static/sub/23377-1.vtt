00:57.966 --> 00:59.456
Hurry up, man.

01:21.557 --> 01:24.685
Party, right wheel.

01:28.664 --> 01:31.997
This court of inquiry
has completed its investigation.

01:32.067 --> 01:35.525
Do you wish to make any statement
or give any evidence?

01:42.311 --> 01:45.747
Harry Harbord Morant.
Lieutenant, Bushveldt Carbineers.

01:46.615 --> 01:48.879
I enlisted in South Australia.

01:49.418 --> 01:51.886
I was with the second contingent
for nine months...

01:51.954 --> 01:54.821
and was promoted to sergeant in that corps.

01:54.890 --> 01:59.384
I received my commission when I transferred
to the Transvaal Constabulary.

01:59.728 --> 02:01.992
I returned to England on six months' leave...

02:02.064 --> 02:04.498
and with the help of my friend, Capt. Hunt...

02:04.566 --> 02:07.831
patched up a quarrel,
an old quarrel with my family.

02:08.270 --> 02:12.331
I had intended to go back to England
to live after the war.

02:13.675 --> 02:16.007
On my return to South Africa...

02:16.411 --> 02:18.641
I fought at Karee Siding...

02:18.714 --> 02:21.114
and Kunstadt under Lord Roberts.

02:21.383 --> 02:26.047
I also fought with Gen. French's
cavalry brigade at Diamond Hill.

02:26.522 --> 02:27.546
After that...

02:27.623 --> 02:30.956
there were requests for volunteers
to join the Bushveldt Carbineers...

02:31.026 --> 02:32.857
in the Northern Transvaal.

02:32.928 --> 02:35.795
I joined on April 1, 1900.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.124
April Fools' Day.

02:38.500 --> 02:43.460
In the Carbineers, I was responsible for
the capture of Boer commando leader, Kelly.

02:43.572 --> 02:45.904
I was recommended for a DSO.

02:46.141 --> 02:48.871
I take full and entire responsibility...

02:49.478 --> 02:51.708
for the events at Fort Edward.

02:51.780 --> 02:54.305
I was, however, acting under orders.

02:56.018 --> 02:59.317
I was also deeply disturbed
by what happened to Capt. Hunt.

03:03.525 --> 03:07.256
No sentries.
Either they're asleep or there's no one there.

03:07.596 --> 03:09.496
- No horses either.
- No.

03:10.265 --> 03:13.530
Ask him if he's sure
if the information is correct.

03:27.616 --> 03:31.347
They have returned from the Cape Colony.
They are very weak.

03:32.087 --> 03:34.214
Stay here with three men...

03:34.756 --> 03:36.223
and this boy.

03:36.825 --> 03:39.089
Keep the horses quiet. Cover us.

03:39.161 --> 03:40.992
Is not good, Captain.

04:16.197 --> 04:18.029
Get back!

04:18.733 --> 04:20.099
Get back over here.

04:28.477 --> 04:31.742
Fall back!

04:33.181 --> 04:36.014
Mount up!

04:36.084 --> 04:37.984
Let's get out of here!

04:38.587 --> 04:41.420
Can't you send them back? For Capt. Hunt.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.947
Watch it, Peter.

05:17.392 --> 05:20.156
- Probably just a stone bruise.
- You think that's all it is?

05:20.228 --> 05:23.391
- Yes. If he limps again, I'll swap it.
- Patrol's back!

05:26.702 --> 05:28.932
Get the Breaker. Get the Breaker!

05:29.004 --> 05:30.699
That's my horse!

05:39.414 --> 05:40.904
What happened?

05:48.023 --> 05:50.048
All right, you men, break.

06:02.704 --> 06:05.104
- They've Capt. Hunt.
- They were waiting for us.

06:05.173 --> 06:07.164
There were many men. Capt. Hunt was shot.

06:07.242 --> 06:10.405
There was nothing we could do.
Bullets whizzing by like blowflies.

06:10.479 --> 06:11.468
Lost five men.

06:11.546 --> 06:14.606
George, go set it up.
We're going out on patrol.

06:16.985 --> 06:20.113
There was nothing we could do.
They must have known we were coming.

06:20.188 --> 06:22.179
Known? Of course they bloody knew.

06:22.257 --> 06:25.420
You can't trust these blokes.
How many sides you fighting on, mate?

06:25.494 --> 06:29.123
Just because you sign a bit of paper
don't mean the war's over.

06:29.398 --> 06:32.526
Mr. Taylor, so much for
your damn intelligence report.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.933
Eight Boers, exhausted.
That's what you said.

06:35.003 --> 06:38.166
Horses with fever, you said.
What do you say now?

06:40.776 --> 06:42.801
I say avenge Capt. Hunt.

07:01.830 --> 07:04.628
Prisoners and escort! Quick march!

07:28.857 --> 07:30.085
Come in.

07:41.903 --> 07:44.565
The court of inquiry
has come to a recommendation.

07:44.639 --> 07:46.004
About time.

07:47.242 --> 07:51.611
It has been decided to proceed with
a military court-martial here at Pietersburg.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.171
You will remain under close arrest.

08:17.439 --> 08:21.034
Maj. Charles Bolton
to see Lord Kitchener and Col. Hamilton.

08:32.087 --> 08:33.577
This way, sir.

08:43.063 --> 08:45.532
Charles, my dear chap.

08:46.167 --> 08:47.395
Good to see you again, sir.

08:47.469 --> 08:49.528
You come highly recommended, young man.

08:49.604 --> 08:50.593
Thank you, sir.

08:50.672 --> 08:53.607
I have a rather important prosecution
I want you to handle.

08:53.675 --> 08:54.937
Yes, sir.

08:55.443 --> 08:58.037
Charles, you've heard of
the Bushveldt Carbineers?

08:58.113 --> 09:01.879
Yes, a special force raised by Lord
Kitchener to deal with the Boer guerrillas.

09:01.950 --> 09:03.144
Correct.

09:03.218 --> 09:06.381
Colonials, most of them. Australians.

09:07.455 --> 09:09.582
I understand
they've been quite effective, sir.

09:09.658 --> 09:11.182
Very effective.

09:11.293 --> 09:13.158
We've just arrested three of them...

09:13.228 --> 09:15.719
for shooting Boer prisoners
and a German missionary.

09:15.797 --> 09:19.028
I've received, Bolton,
a telegraph message from Whitehall.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.194
The German government has lodged
a serious protest...

09:22.270 --> 09:25.330
- about the missionary in particular.
- Yes, sir.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.876
The Kaiser, as you know,
is our late Queen's grandson.

09:29.210 --> 09:34.113
The fact is that Whitehall feels the Germans
are looking for an excuse to enter the war.

09:34.182 --> 09:37.447
On the Boers' side, of course.
We don't want to give them one.

09:37.519 --> 09:41.080
Needless to say, the Germans
couldn't give a damn about the Boers.

09:41.156 --> 09:44.182
It's the diamonds and gold of South Africa
they're interested in.

09:44.259 --> 09:46.386
They lack our altruism, sir.

09:47.929 --> 09:49.089
Quite.

09:52.601 --> 09:55.593
Here's the report of the preliminary inquiry.

09:56.571 --> 09:59.938
The evidence against the Australians
is overwhelming.

10:00.875 --> 10:02.740
Who's handling the defense, sir?

10:02.811 --> 10:06.212
We expect no difficulties there.
Selected one of their own chaps...

10:06.281 --> 10:09.216
a major from the New South Wales Mounted.

10:27.569 --> 10:29.662
Still can't get used to it.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.495
Court-martial.

10:31.973 --> 10:34.533
On the ship coming over here,
the blokes used to joke...

10:34.609 --> 10:36.236
about who'd be the first to get a VC.

10:36.311 --> 10:37.938
Scratch yourself from that race, mate.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.709
My father said the war
would make a man of me.

10:40.782 --> 10:43.376
Everybody's father says that, George.

10:44.285 --> 10:46.981
- It's really...
- Ironic?

10:51.359 --> 10:54.522
He believes in the British Empire, you know.
We all do in my family.

10:54.596 --> 10:57.861
That's why I volunteered,
to help keep the Empire together.

10:58.733 --> 11:01.361
I volunteered
because there's a depression back there...

11:01.436 --> 11:03.563
and I've got a wife and kid.

11:03.638 --> 11:06.038
You believe in the Empire, Harry?

11:06.875 --> 11:08.137
Do I?

11:10.111 --> 11:12.204
Don't reckon he does, mate.

11:23.425 --> 11:26.417
Maj. J.F. Thomas.
I'm your defending officer.

11:26.728 --> 11:29.094
- George Witton.
- Harry Morant.

11:29.764 --> 11:32.824
New South Wales Mounted.
What sort of a lawyer are you?

11:32.901 --> 11:36.632
They haven't locked me up yet.
What sort of soldier are you?

11:39.040 --> 11:41.338
They're looking after you here?

11:42.711 --> 11:44.474
Looks a bit Spartan.

11:44.879 --> 11:47.746
Well, it's not exactly the Hotel Australia.

11:47.816 --> 11:51.115
More like a coffee palace. No grog.

11:53.655 --> 11:56.954
They gave you the report
on the preliminary inquiry?

12:00.295 --> 12:02.058
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday?

12:02.130 --> 12:05.588
- But the trial starts tomorrow.
- We thought you were going to miss it.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.601
You don't know anything about us.

12:07.669 --> 12:10.297
Only what's in the preliminary report.

12:12.006 --> 12:14.975
And that, gentlemen, is not very flattering.

12:18.747 --> 12:22.649
As a matter of interest,
how many courts-martial have you done?

12:24.819 --> 12:26.650
- None.
- None?

12:26.721 --> 12:29.656
Jesus, they're playing with
a double-headed penny, aren't they?

12:29.724 --> 12:31.658
Would you rather
conduct your own defense?

12:31.726 --> 12:35.594
But you have handled
a lot of court cases back home, sir?

12:37.699 --> 12:40.793
No. I was a country town solicitor.

12:41.669 --> 12:45.537
I handled land conveyancing and wills.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.467
Wills. Might come in handy.

12:48.576 --> 12:50.407
I'm going to need a lot of information.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.311
Do you think they're going to imprison us
or cashier us, sir?

12:53.381 --> 12:56.475
- My father, if he found out...
- Haven't they told you?

12:59.053 --> 13:01.453
There are several murder charges.

13:01.923 --> 13:03.720
The penalty is death.

13:14.569 --> 13:16.594
"Long as the waves shall roll

13:16.838 --> 13:18.897
"Long as fame guards us whole

13:19.607 --> 13:22.804
"And men who heart and soul
thrill to true glory

13:23.511 --> 13:25.741
"Their deeds from age to age

13:25.814 --> 13:28.282
"Shall voice and verse engage

13:28.349 --> 13:32.445
"Swelling the splendid page
of England's story"

13:34.255 --> 13:36.587
It's a matter of discipline and tradition.

13:36.658 --> 13:40.492
Do you think this could've happened with
any contingent besides the Australians?

13:40.562 --> 13:41.824
But Morant's not an Australian.

13:41.896 --> 13:46.333
You're splitting hairs. He's been out there
15 years, learned all their bad habits.

13:47.268 --> 13:49.862
I never thought
you colonials got lost, Major.

13:49.938 --> 13:51.269
I've been at the prison, sir.

13:51.339 --> 13:53.432
Maj. Thomas, Maj. Bolton.

13:53.641 --> 13:57.133
Capt. Nicholson. Lts. Reed and Baxter.

13:57.345 --> 13:58.403
Miss...

14:01.850 --> 14:03.112
How do you do?

14:24.539 --> 14:27.667
I understand your Mr. Morant
is something of a poet, Major.

14:27.742 --> 14:31.303
<i>That's right.
He wrote for a paper called The Bulletin...</i>

14:31.579 --> 14:32.705
in Sydney.

14:35.850 --> 14:39.946
A Tennyson of the Transvaal.
The Byron of the Bushveldt Carbineers.

14:41.823 --> 14:44.121
Why is it he's referred to as Breaker Morant?

14:44.192 --> 14:46.990
Ladies' man, perhaps? A breaker of hearts.

14:47.295 --> 14:49.388
No, he was a horse breaker.

14:49.530 --> 14:51.725
I understand, the best in Australia.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.861
Quite a Renaissance figure.

14:55.970 --> 14:57.096
I daresay...

14:57.171 --> 15:01.631
if everything goes well,
he could come and recite for us one night.

15:04.178 --> 15:08.444
In the meantime, this fine-looking fellow
is an ex-opponent of ours...

15:08.516 --> 15:11.007
who's wisely signed
the non-combatant pledge.

15:11.085 --> 15:13.610
They say he has a fine voice.
Only speaks Dutch, though.

15:13.688 --> 15:17.784
So, Mr. Baxter and ladies,
you'll have to tell us what it's all about.

16:16.184 --> 16:19.620
A few things to clear up.
How many men at Fort Edward?

16:19.921 --> 16:22.719
About 50. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

16:24.625 --> 16:27.458
- And most were Australians?
- We told you all this last night.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.996
- About 45 of them were.
- Gentlemen.

16:36.904 --> 16:39.134
The intelligence officer, Captain...

16:39.207 --> 16:41.402
- Taylor?
- Taylor, yes.

16:42.143 --> 16:44.805
- What did he have to do with this?
- Nothing.

16:44.879 --> 16:47.848
Then who do you think filed the report
that led to your arrest?

16:47.915 --> 16:51.351
Don't know, but it wasn't Taylor.
He was a good bloke.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.097
Bring in the accused.

17:50.812 --> 17:55.647
- This court-martial is convened by order of...
- I'd like to ask for an adjournment, sir.

17:57.151 --> 18:00.314
- Adjournment? We've only just arrived.
- Yes, sir.

18:00.488 --> 18:03.480
I only just arrived in Pietersburg yesterday.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.819
It doesn't give me much time
to prepare a defense.

18:05.893 --> 18:07.360
The prosecution's had six weeks.

18:07.428 --> 18:10.659
There are witnesses who have
traveled over 60 miles for this hearing.

18:10.731 --> 18:13.393
Do you expect us to keep them around
at taxpayers' expense?

18:13.468 --> 18:16.528
- Yes, sir. I need time...
- Quite out of the question, Major...

18:16.604 --> 18:17.593
Thomas.

18:21.843 --> 18:24.641
This court-martial is convened by order...

18:26.347 --> 18:28.008
Yes, Maj. Thomas.

18:28.082 --> 18:31.017
This court-martial is unconstitutional, sir.

18:37.425 --> 18:40.917
The three defendants
are Australian subjects...

18:41.162 --> 18:44.598
and as the country is now
an independent commonwealth...

18:44.665 --> 18:47.657
they can only be tried
by the Australian Army.

18:48.736 --> 18:52.069
The defendants, Major,
were serving in the Bushveldt Carbineers...

18:52.140 --> 18:54.335
a unit under British command.

19:00.047 --> 19:02.072
This court-martial is convened by order of...

19:02.150 --> 19:04.277
Horatio Herbert,
Lord Kitchener of Khartoum...

19:04.352 --> 19:06.650
GCB, GCMG, RE...

19:06.754 --> 19:11.657
Commander in Chief of British
and Colonial Forces in South Africa.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.320
The charges are as follows:

19:14.395 --> 19:16.124
Defendants Morant, Handcock, and Witton...

19:16.197 --> 19:18.961
are charged with the murder
of a Boer prisoner named Visser.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.864
They are also charged with the murders...

19:20.935 --> 19:23.267
of six other Boer prisoners,
names unknown.

19:23.337 --> 19:25.532
In addition, Lts. Morant and Handcock...

19:25.606 --> 19:28.200
are charged with the murder
of a German missionary...

19:28.276 --> 19:30.870
the Reverend H.C.V. Hesse.

19:31.812 --> 19:33.439
How do you plead?

19:36.951 --> 19:38.316
Not guilty.

19:41.622 --> 19:42.987
Not guilty.

19:45.526 --> 19:46.891
Not guilty.

19:49.297 --> 19:52.198
- Not guilty of all three charges?
- Yes, sir.

19:53.968 --> 19:56.334
Your first witness, Maj. Bolton.

19:57.872 --> 19:59.863
Call Mr. Donald Robertson.

20:11.452 --> 20:13.044
Robertson, who's he?

20:13.421 --> 20:15.912
We told you about him last night.

20:15.990 --> 20:18.481
Take this Bible in your right hand.

20:18.726 --> 20:21.661
Now repeat after me,
I swear by almighty God...

20:23.297 --> 20:25.891
that the evidence I shall give
before this court...

20:27.568 --> 20:29.433
shall be the truth...

20:29.537 --> 20:30.970
the whole truth...

20:31.105 --> 20:33.232
and nothing but the truth.

20:33.841 --> 20:36.708
Thank you.
Would you like to take the witness chair?

20:47.054 --> 20:48.316
Capt. Robertson...

20:48.389 --> 20:50.949
you were in the regular army for 20 years.

20:51.025 --> 20:53.653
Yes, sir. I was with the 10th Hussars...

20:53.728 --> 20:57.858
before taking command of
the Bushveldt Carbineers in the Transvaal.

20:58.266 --> 21:00.757
And how was discipline in the Carbineers?

21:01.636 --> 21:05.072
Lmpossible. Especially with the Australians.

21:05.706 --> 21:08.834
They didn't like picket duty or guard duty.

21:08.909 --> 21:12.208
The only day we could get them
on parade was payday.

21:13.214 --> 21:14.704
Could you give the court...

21:14.782 --> 21:17.649
any other examples
of their breaches of discipline?

21:18.152 --> 21:19.881
There were so many.

21:20.087 --> 21:22.214
They'd only salute the officers they liked.

21:22.290 --> 21:25.384
- Reckon you didn't get too many salutes.
- Order.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.893
Some of them had these illegal stills.

21:27.962 --> 21:31.454
Made this really strong drink
out of corn and boot polish.

21:31.532 --> 21:34.592
- You'd know. You were their best customer.
- Order.

21:35.403 --> 21:37.871
They stole cattle and sold them.

21:37.938 --> 21:40.907
- Now, this cattle, did it belong to...
- I must object.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.967
Two of the defendants
were not even at Fort Edward...

21:45.046 --> 21:47.105
Sir, I'm trying to establish for the court...

21:47.181 --> 21:50.844
the irregularities and unsoldierly behavior
of the Bushveldt Carbineers.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.681
Objection overruled.

21:53.821 --> 21:55.345
Thank you, sir.

21:55.823 --> 21:58.621
Would you go on please, Capt. Robertson?

21:59.060 --> 22:01.324
I had to reprimand Handcock here...

22:01.395 --> 22:05.058
for what I considered to be
a serious breach of the rules of war.

22:05.132 --> 22:06.793
And what was that?

22:07.168 --> 22:11.434
He placed prisoners of war in open wagons
in front of train engines.

22:11.772 --> 22:14.832
They could have been shot at
by their own side.

22:16.544 --> 22:19.035
Thank you. That'll be all, Captain.

22:20.614 --> 22:22.047
Just hold your horses there.

22:22.116 --> 22:25.279
Do you wish to cross-examine
the witness, Maj. Thomas?

22:25.353 --> 22:27.446
Yes, sir, I do.

22:37.031 --> 22:39.761
Now tell me... Tell us...

22:41.135 --> 22:43.831
when you joined the Carbineers...

22:44.105 --> 22:46.232
what were you told they'd be doing?

22:46.307 --> 22:49.674
- Fighting the enemy.
- Yes.

22:51.412 --> 22:54.176
I mean, how?
It was a new kind of corps, wasn't it?

22:54.248 --> 22:55.613
That's right.

22:55.683 --> 22:59.278
We had to fight behind the lines,
against the Boer commandos.

22:59.353 --> 23:00.684
Commandos?

23:00.988 --> 23:04.185
That's a new word.
That's a Boer word, isn't it?

23:05.626 --> 23:07.287
What does it mean?

23:07.795 --> 23:10.025
The commandos had to live off the land.

23:10.097 --> 23:13.897
Use hit-and-run tactics.
Surprise attacks, that sort of thing.

23:14.335 --> 23:17.702
The Boers did it,
so it was the only way we could fight back.

23:21.675 --> 23:24.371
And it must have been very difficult...

23:25.079 --> 23:28.139
to maintain discipline
under these sort of conditions?

23:28.215 --> 23:30.410
It was, with the Australians.

23:30.885 --> 23:33.649
- But you tried?
- Aye.

23:36.891 --> 23:39.451
Like when you reprimanded Lt. Handcock...

23:39.527 --> 23:43.861
for putting the war prisoners
in the carriages in front of the engines?

23:44.598 --> 23:47.499
I told him we didn't do that sort of thing.

23:49.336 --> 23:51.668
But in the Carbineers, I mean...

23:52.072 --> 23:54.939
you were doing a lot of things
that you'd never done before.

23:55.009 --> 23:57.443
That's right, but there's a limit.

24:02.483 --> 24:05.543
What was Lt. Handcock's reason...

24:05.886 --> 24:09.686
for placing these carriages of prisoners
in front of trains?

24:10.691 --> 24:14.593
The Boers had been mining the lines
and blowing up a lot of trains.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.892
He thought it might stop them.

24:17.298 --> 24:18.492
Did it?

24:28.442 --> 24:29.807
Did it?

24:32.246 --> 24:35.807
Yes, they did stop blowing up the trains,
but I don't think that's the...

24:35.883 --> 24:38.010
When you were in command
at Fort Edward...

24:38.085 --> 24:41.248
before the late Capt. Hunt
and Lt. Morant took over...

24:41.322 --> 24:43.847
what did you do with Boer prisoners?

24:46.427 --> 24:47.792
How do you mean?

24:48.229 --> 24:50.220
Fort Edward's only a farmhouse.

24:50.297 --> 24:52.765
There aren't any facilities for them there.

24:52.833 --> 24:54.858
What did you do with them?

24:55.736 --> 24:58.933
We sent them down here
under guard to Pietersburg.

24:59.907 --> 25:01.067
I see.

25:02.776 --> 25:06.234
How many of them
did you send down here to Pietersburg?

25:07.815 --> 25:10.682
Fifty, seventy...

25:10.985 --> 25:13.283
- I really couldn't say.
- I've been informed...

25:13.354 --> 25:15.447
that during your command...

25:15.523 --> 25:18.515
only 29 prisoners were sent to Pietersburg.

25:20.227 --> 25:23.822
So what did you do with the others?
It's quite a discrepancy, isn't it...

25:23.898 --> 25:26.093
- between 50...
- Objection, Mr. President!

25:26.166 --> 25:28.566
- This man is not on trial.
- He bloody ought to be.

25:28.636 --> 25:31.696
Extraneous comments prejudice your case,
Lt. Handcock.

25:31.772 --> 25:34.297
- What in hell does that mean?
- Objection allowed.

25:34.375 --> 25:36.070
Was there a policy...

25:36.143 --> 25:38.441
to shoot prisoners
in the Bushveldt Carbineers?

25:38.512 --> 25:39.809
Mr. President!

25:39.880 --> 25:42.872
The defending officer is attempting
to incriminate the witness.

25:42.950 --> 25:46.750
Maj. Thomas, objection allowed.
The witness is not on trial.

25:47.187 --> 25:51.021
Sir, I'm trying to establish the credibility...

25:51.792 --> 25:54.989
- I'm sorry, lack of all credibility...
- Objection!

25:55.062 --> 25:57.860
You are incriminating the witness, Major!

26:01.936 --> 26:03.028
All right.

26:05.940 --> 26:07.840
Just one more question.

26:08.242 --> 26:11.177
Did you discontinue the practice...

26:11.245 --> 26:13.941
of placing prisoners in open carriages?

26:20.921 --> 26:22.388
No, I didn't.

26:22.923 --> 26:25.892
Why not, if you objected to it?

26:26.727 --> 26:29.628
Could it have been that the practice,
though irregular...

26:29.697 --> 26:32.495
was effective in controlling Boer attacks?

26:36.370 --> 26:38.668
That will be all, Mr. Robertson.

26:42.743 --> 26:44.734
You may stand down, Mr. Robertson.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.177
Good on you, mate.

26:51.719 --> 26:54.313
I will proceed now, sir,
with the extraordinary events...

26:54.388 --> 26:56.083
following the death of Capt. Hunt...

26:56.156 --> 26:58.488
- and the subsequent murder of the Boer...
- Objection.

26:58.559 --> 27:00.754
This has not yet been proved.

27:02.296 --> 27:03.957
Objection allowed.

27:04.298 --> 27:07.495
The subsequent death
of the Boer prisoner, Visser.

27:08.702 --> 27:10.567
Sgt. Maj. Drummond...

27:10.638 --> 27:12.868
following your patrol's return
to Fort Edward...

27:12.940 --> 27:16.899
Lt. Morant ordered the force to return
immediately to Phil Jurne's farmhouse.

27:16.977 --> 27:19.673
Yes, sir. He didn't even let us have a feed.

27:24.818 --> 27:28.015
George, check the house!
Five men, with me!

27:37.898 --> 27:39.263
Is it Hunt?

27:39.733 --> 27:41.462
What's left of him.

27:44.705 --> 27:47.265
We'll rest the horses,
then we'll go after them.

27:47.341 --> 27:51.277
They got nearly two days' start,
and we don't have the direction.

27:51.679 --> 27:54.170
They'll have gone to the Waterberg.

27:54.281 --> 27:56.146
Where else can they go?

27:58.452 --> 27:59.680
Christ!

27:59.920 --> 28:03.447
We rode another couple of days,
up on to the high veldt.

28:03.924 --> 28:05.619
Hardly ever stopped.

28:05.693 --> 28:08.491
<i>Morant was right about where they'd gone.</i>

28:18.372 --> 28:19.532
We'll get them now.

28:19.606 --> 28:23.736
- We ought to wait an hour, it'll be dark then.
- We'll get them now!

29:19.967 --> 29:22.265
We got a few of them,
but most of them got away.

29:22.336 --> 29:24.133
Get on back.

29:24.772 --> 29:27.138
Horseback! Hurry it up.

29:29.343 --> 29:32.141
Get that body off the tent.

29:33.847 --> 29:37.339
Come on, you blokes, get some of this
Boer coffee in you while you can.

29:37.417 --> 29:40.853
- We've got to follow.
- Bugger the Boers.

29:42.055 --> 29:44.956
What do you think you're doing?
Come on, get out of there.

29:45.025 --> 29:46.925
Get out of there.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.572
You're in trouble, mate.

30:01.108 --> 30:02.302
Get up.

30:05.145 --> 30:07.272
He's wearing Hunt's uniform.

30:07.681 --> 30:09.148
Get up there.

30:13.320 --> 30:14.651
Your name?

30:14.788 --> 30:16.915
- Ask him his name.
- What is your name?

30:16.990 --> 30:19.151
Teunis Visser.

30:19.393 --> 30:23.329
You were at the farmhouse.
You killed Capt. Hunt, the British officer.

30:27.134 --> 30:30.831
- He says no. He didn't kill him.
- What do you mean you didn't kill him?

30:30.904 --> 30:33.930
You're wearing his bloody jacket, blast you!

30:34.241 --> 30:36.334
What do you mean you didn't kill him?

30:36.410 --> 30:38.605
This man killed Capt. Hunt!

30:39.613 --> 30:41.979
He will be executed immediately!

30:42.816 --> 30:44.909
I want an eight-man firing squad.

30:47.454 --> 30:50.287
I reckon we ought to
take him back to Fort Edward.

30:56.997 --> 30:59.989
I want to be on the firing party, Lieutenant.

31:00.534 --> 31:04.300
He killed Capt. Hunt.
If he did not, he would not have his uniform.

31:04.605 --> 31:06.072
Please, Lieutenant.

31:07.241 --> 31:09.300
Most of the blokes aren't too keen on this.

31:09.376 --> 31:12.675
Why don't you have a yarn with him?
He might take some notice of you.

31:12.746 --> 31:16.682
You killed him!
You're wearing his bloody jacket, man!

31:16.750 --> 31:19.218
- Harry.
- He will be executed, George.

31:19.620 --> 31:23.454
Capt. Hunt had bullet wounds
only in the shoulder and the leg.

31:23.523 --> 31:25.252
They mutilated him!

31:26.393 --> 31:29.920
They mutilated him with knives
while he was still alive.

31:32.232 --> 31:34.496
He'll never get to heaven if he doesn't die.

31:34.568 --> 31:37.366
Yeah, he's gonna sleep real good tonight.

31:48.782 --> 31:50.147
Get up, come on.

32:15.575 --> 32:16.769
Ready!

32:20.113 --> 32:21.171
Aim!

32:22.082 --> 32:23.174
Fire!

32:27.754 --> 32:30.723
<i>Did you object to Lt. Morant's treatment
of the prisoner?</i>

32:30.791 --> 32:32.053
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

32:32.192 --> 32:34.820
Do you consider
that the prisoner was given a fair trial?

32:34.895 --> 32:37.989
No, sir. Not in the state Lt. Morant was in.

32:38.065 --> 32:40.966
He was like a madman, sir.

32:42.502 --> 32:45.300
Thank you, Sgt. Maj. Drummond.

32:45.906 --> 32:48.033
Any questions, Maj. Thomas?

32:49.810 --> 32:52.404
You are aware
that Lord Kitchener issued orders...

32:52.479 --> 32:55.573
that Boers caught wearing khaki
were to be shot?

33:00.087 --> 33:02.214
Major, Lord Kitchener's order only applied...

33:02.289 --> 33:05.053
if they were wearing khaki
with an intention to deceive.

33:05.125 --> 33:08.561
- The first I've heard of that.
- That's how they're interpreting it.

33:08.628 --> 33:13.088
More like he was trying to keep out the cold.
The Boers are real short of supplies.

33:15.535 --> 33:19.767
You are a regular soldier and were one of
the first to join the Bushveldt Carbineers.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.400
- You served under Capt. Robertson?
- That's right.

33:22.476 --> 33:25.502
Would you agree
that discipline had improved...

33:25.579 --> 33:30.243
once Mr. Robertson was removed
and Capt. Hunt and Lt. Morant took over.

33:30.917 --> 33:32.248
I suppose.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.782
Try yes or no, Sergeant Major.

33:38.492 --> 33:41.222
Morant and Handcock broke up illegal stills,
did they not?

33:41.294 --> 33:44.127
- And forced troopers to return stolen cattle?
- Yes.

33:44.197 --> 33:47.223
There were, in fact,
dismissals from the corps.

33:48.135 --> 33:51.434
Did this cause resentment
against Morant and Handcock?

33:52.139 --> 33:53.970
A bit. It's natural.

33:55.175 --> 33:59.339
And some of those dismissed
are now witnesses for the prosecution?

34:02.682 --> 34:06.140
Were not you yourself reprimanded
for holding stolen cattle?

34:06.219 --> 34:09.188
I explained that!
I came across them while I was on patrol.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.520
I only impounded them, that's all!

34:11.591 --> 34:13.581
I have no more questions.

34:14.061 --> 34:16.460
You may stand down, Mr. Drummond.

34:20.300 --> 34:23.929
- You couldn't lie straight in bed.
- I don't have to take that from you.

34:24.004 --> 34:26.632
Come outside,
I'll knock your bloody head off.

34:26.706 --> 34:30.233
Control yourself, Mr. Handcock,
or you'll find yourself in serious trouble.

34:30.310 --> 34:31.902
You find that amusing.

34:31.978 --> 34:34.969
I was just wondering
how much more serious things could be.

34:35.047 --> 34:36.572
Anytime, mate.

34:44.024 --> 34:45.855
<i>Since signing a non-combatant agreement...</i>

34:45.926 --> 34:48.827
you've been a guide and interpreter
to the Carbineers?

34:49.963 --> 34:52.659
Would you please tell the court
exactly what happened...

34:52.732 --> 34:55.098
after the capture of the Boer prisoner?

34:55.268 --> 34:57.998
No one wanted to go on the firing party.

34:59.172 --> 35:03.006
So he said if we did not,
he would shoot the prisoner himself.

35:05.245 --> 35:06.837
Mr. Botha, do you consider...

35:06.913 --> 35:09.575
that the prisoner, Visser,
received a fair trial?

35:09.649 --> 35:12.379
Objection! The witness
is obviously not qualified to answer.

35:12.452 --> 35:14.647
I will rephrase the question.

35:14.955 --> 35:18.948
Was the trial of Visser in any way
similar to this court-martial?

35:19.693 --> 35:21.058
No. Nothing like this.

35:21.128 --> 35:23.596
I repeat,
the witness is not in the British Army.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.858
He is not qualified to answer.

35:25.932 --> 35:28.457
I believe the question is pertinent.

35:28.935 --> 35:30.994
You may proceed, Maj. Bolton.

35:31.071 --> 35:33.801
I have no more questions, Mr. President.

35:33.874 --> 35:37.776
But I would like to add that I've been
generous in even using the word "trial"...

35:37.844 --> 35:40.438
or "court-martial"
in relation to the killing of Visser.

35:40.514 --> 35:43.415
It was a conspiracy. It was a consultation.

35:43.717 --> 35:47.949
It was a measure to mature
a criminal purpose, but it was not a court.

35:51.391 --> 35:52.983
Trooper Botha.

35:53.193 --> 35:56.390
Didn't you volunteer
to shoot the prisoner Visser?

36:00.333 --> 36:03.268
If word got around town
he was offering to shoot his mates...

36:03.336 --> 36:05.702
his life wouldn't be worth half a crown.

36:05.772 --> 36:08.172
- You volunteered, Trooper Botha.
- No.

36:08.241 --> 36:10.471
No. I only obeyed orders.

36:10.544 --> 36:11.738
That is a lie.

36:11.811 --> 36:15.042
Didn't all the troopers
in the firing squad volunteer?

36:15.282 --> 36:17.341
No, I was commanded.

36:17.551 --> 36:21.715
You knew Capt. Hunt had told Lts. Morant
and Handcock not to bring in prisoners...

36:21.788 --> 36:24.018
- but to shoot them.
- I did not.

36:24.991 --> 36:27.221
I knew nothing of such orders.

36:36.069 --> 36:37.593
Company, order.

36:57.424 --> 36:59.187
Lt. Morant...

36:59.259 --> 37:01.557
Capt. Hunt was a particular friend of yours.

37:01.628 --> 37:03.289
Yes. I mean...

37:04.531 --> 37:07.091
I was engaged to his sister in England.

37:07.167 --> 37:09.897
So his death was very disturbing to you.

37:10.570 --> 37:12.697
It was more the way he died.

37:13.940 --> 37:14.998
He was mutilated.

37:15.075 --> 37:18.772
You were present at the action
where Capt. Hunt was killed?

37:19.980 --> 37:20.969
No.

37:22.482 --> 37:25.212
Then how do you know
he wasn't killed in a fair fight?

37:25.285 --> 37:26.547
Because I saw his body.

37:26.620 --> 37:30.181
Some time later. You can't possibly know
how Capt. Hunt met his death.

37:30.257 --> 37:34.057
So you cannot produce any evidence
to connect Visser with it.

37:34.194 --> 37:36.594
So then why did you order him to be shot?

37:36.663 --> 37:39.928
It is customary during a war to kill
as many of the enemy as possible.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.766
Was your court at the trial of Visser
constituted in any way like this?

37:43.837 --> 37:46.863
- What rule did you shoot him under?
- Like this?

37:47.440 --> 37:49.931
No, sir, it wasn't quite like this.

37:50.543 --> 37:53.137
No, sir, it wasn't quite so handsome.

37:53.713 --> 37:55.408
And as for rules...

37:55.482 --> 37:57.746
we didn't carry military manuals
around with us.

37:57.817 --> 38:01.617
We were out on the veldt,
fighting the Boer the way he fought us.

38:01.688 --> 38:03.918
I'll tell you what rule we applied, sir.

38:03.990 --> 38:06.185
We applied rule 3-0-3.

38:07.227 --> 38:09.752
We caught them
and we shot them under rule 3-0-3.

38:17.237 --> 38:21.139
<i>Farewell to Lochaber</i>

38:21.207 --> 38:24.734
<i>And farewell, my Jean</i>

38:25.378 --> 38:29.280
<i>Where heartsome with thee</i>

38:29.349 --> 38:32.978
<i>I hae monie days been</i>

38:47.267 --> 38:49.167
Did you get a reply from the consul?

38:49.235 --> 38:52.136
No. Either the English
aren't sending the telegrams...

38:52.205 --> 38:54.799
or the Australians are ignoring them.

38:56.643 --> 38:58.702
How's your eyesight, Sergeant?

38:58.778 --> 39:00.302
Very weak, sir.

39:02.148 --> 39:03.115
Thank you.

39:03.183 --> 39:06.550
You're the best witness
the prosecution's got, Harry.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.945
Better watch your temper.

39:09.022 --> 39:10.580
Yes, I'm sorry.

39:12.325 --> 39:15.624
It's my great failing. Impetuosity.
Most un-British.

39:16.162 --> 39:18.221
You better watch yourself, too.

39:18.298 --> 39:21.597
This is a British court-martial,
not a backbox pub.

39:27.107 --> 39:30.270
We've got a few witnesses of our own
tomorrow, anyway.

39:30.343 --> 39:31.605
Not many.

39:32.545 --> 39:36.345
Just about anyone with a good word for us
has been sent to India.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.544
Go on, read it to us, Harry.

39:40.954 --> 39:43.752
Peter, come on.
You know you loathe poetry.

39:44.290 --> 39:46.349
There's not much else to bloody do here.

39:46.426 --> 39:48.053
Come on, read it.

39:52.165 --> 39:54.565
"Oh, those rides across the river

39:54.801 --> 39:57.292
"Where the shallow stream runs wide

39:58.338 --> 40:02.570
"And the sunset's beams were glossing
strips of sand on either side

40:03.743 --> 40:07.736
"We would cross the sparkling river
on the brown horse and the bay

40:08.415 --> 40:12.408
"Watch the willows sway and shiver
and the trembling shadows play

40:13.820 --> 40:15.947
"'Tis a memory to be hoarded

40:16.589 --> 40:18.784
"Of a foolish tale and fond

40:20.393 --> 40:22.588
"Till another stream be forded

40:23.430 --> 40:25.762
"And we reach the great beyond"

40:28.501 --> 40:30.264
I don't want to die.

40:33.139 --> 40:36.233
Every life ends
in a dreadful execution, George.

40:36.776 --> 40:40.234
Yours will be much quicker
and less painful than most.

40:41.181 --> 40:43.308
And a lot earlier than most.

41:11.211 --> 41:12.735
I swear by almighty God...

41:27.293 --> 41:31.229
Just a Charlie who used to be with the
Carbineers. Boers aren't fond of turncoats.

41:32.932 --> 41:34.456
Capt. Taylor...

41:34.567 --> 41:38.367
you were with the Bushveldt Carbineers,
but not actually a member of the corps?

41:38.438 --> 41:39.666
That's correct.

41:39.739 --> 41:42.435
I joined the Carbineers
as intelligence officer...

41:42.509 --> 41:44.875
at the request of Lord Kitchener.

41:45.011 --> 41:47.479
I had lived in South Africa...

41:47.647 --> 41:51.606
before the war and spoke some of
the native languages as well as Dutch.

41:51.684 --> 41:54.517
And were you senior to Lt. Morant?

41:55.255 --> 41:56.950
I was senior, yes...

41:57.023 --> 42:00.424
but the day-to-day running of the corps
was left to Lt. Morant.

42:00.493 --> 42:03.621
Although he sometimes
referred matters to me.

42:04.964 --> 42:07.956
And what is your opinion of Lt. Morant?

42:10.737 --> 42:12.227
A good fellow.

42:12.505 --> 42:14.735
One could not help liking him.

42:15.008 --> 42:17.101
He was a little hotheaded.

42:17.176 --> 42:20.668
Inclined, perhaps, to do things
on the impulse of the moment.

42:21.314 --> 42:24.545
The men obeyed him. He's a good soldier.

42:25.318 --> 42:27.513
Did you know Capt. Hunt well?

42:29.856 --> 42:31.255
Hunt? Yes, I did.

42:31.324 --> 42:34.589
Did you know of any orders
to shoot Boer prisoners?

42:46.139 --> 42:48.471
There was an understanding.

42:49.175 --> 42:50.767
Kitchener is quite right, you know.

42:50.843 --> 42:54.472
Lord Roberts is far too correct
for this kind of a war.

42:54.781 --> 42:58.342
All the internments, deportations
should be over in a matter of months.

42:58.418 --> 43:00.443
- You'll be going home?
- Me?

43:00.954 --> 43:04.617
I don't think so.
There should be a few opportunities here.

43:04.891 --> 43:07.519
Nothing will keep me in South Africa.

43:08.328 --> 43:10.489
Good day. How did you do?

43:10.797 --> 43:14.096
- Pretty good, by the look of it.
- No stopping me now, Peter.

43:15.935 --> 43:17.459
Go well, Harry?

43:17.670 --> 43:20.161
Not bad. One dead, one wounded.

43:22.675 --> 43:24.336
Mind you, I got 13 of them.

43:24.410 --> 43:27.106
Crept up on them while they were asleep.

43:28.281 --> 43:30.078
This lot surrendered.

43:32.885 --> 43:34.284
God, Harry...

43:34.354 --> 43:37.653
we've got no facilities for prisoners,
can't even feed them.

43:39.826 --> 43:41.418
Execute those men.

43:46.499 --> 43:47.898
You too, Greg.

44:01.180 --> 44:03.478
Simon, I thought the proclamation...

44:03.549 --> 44:06.814
only applied to Boers
caught wearing British khaki.

44:07.020 --> 44:09.011
New orders from Kitchener.

44:09.088 --> 44:12.819
Col. Hamilton's confirmed it to me himself.
No prisoners.

44:13.292 --> 44:15.419
The gentlemen's war is over.

44:15.962 --> 44:18.260
Here, break your teeth on this.

44:51.164 --> 44:55.897
Had Mr. Morant executed any more prisoners
prior to the death of Capt. Hunt?

44:56.402 --> 44:59.565
- No, he had not.
- He had, then, disobeyed orders?

45:00.339 --> 45:01.772
Strictly speaking, yes.

45:01.841 --> 45:05.299
And he is now on trial
for later obeying those same orders?

45:05.378 --> 45:06.845
I object, sir.

45:07.080 --> 45:09.048
<i>The Manual of Military Law states:</i>

45:09.115 --> 45:12.278
"Persons captured under arms
against British forces in the field...

45:12.351 --> 45:15.752
"shall be placed within the jurisdiction
of the nearest provo-marshal...

45:15.822 --> 45:18.313
- "or garrison commander."
- They were not the orders...

45:18.391 --> 45:20.359
- under which we operated.
- Indeed.

45:20.426 --> 45:22.758
You saw a copy
of Lord Kitchener's new orders?

45:22.829 --> 45:24.296
- No.
- Sanctioning executions?

45:24.363 --> 45:26.888
No. But they were common knowledge.

45:26.966 --> 45:29.161
I told you they were verbal orders
from Pretoria.

45:29.235 --> 45:32.568
- And no one can substantiate them.
- Capt. Hunt relayed them.

45:32.638 --> 45:34.196
- Capt. Hunt is dead.
- Order.

45:34.273 --> 45:36.468
This evidence is completely irrelevant.

45:36.542 --> 45:38.032
Irrelevant?

45:38.111 --> 45:40.579
Irrelevant when I have established...

45:40.646 --> 45:43.513
that it was common practice
among the Bushveldt Carbineers...

45:43.583 --> 45:45.278
to shoot prisoners?

45:45.618 --> 45:50.555
Why would an officer of Capt. Hunt's
spotless reputation invent an order, sir?

45:51.157 --> 45:55.025
We all admire your zeal in defending
your fellow Australians, Maj. Thomas...

45:55.094 --> 45:59.360
but intemperate speech and
wild accusations do not further your cause.

46:01.434 --> 46:03.061
Capt. Taylor...

46:04.170 --> 46:08.004
did you know of any other incident
similar to the Visser case?

46:08.474 --> 46:12.035
I once saw a Boer dealt with
in the same manner...

46:12.111 --> 46:13.874
for wearing British khaki.

46:14.013 --> 46:15.947
- Shot?
- He was shot, yes.

46:16.015 --> 46:18.711
You are still introducing irrelevant material.

46:20.620 --> 46:22.417
I wish to establish...

46:22.488 --> 46:26.083
and I have made the point before
in connection with Mr. Robertson...

46:26.159 --> 46:29.822
that a precedent in this war
has been well and truly set.

46:29.896 --> 46:34.390
Sir, I would like to point out
to my learned colonial colleague...

46:34.767 --> 46:37.497
that the fact of the crime
being previously committed...

46:37.570 --> 46:41.734
in no way pardons the behavior
of Lt. Morant and his friends.

46:42.008 --> 46:43.999
I have no more questions.

46:44.777 --> 46:46.404
You are, are you not...

46:46.479 --> 46:49.209
the same Capt. Taylor
who's yet to be court-martialed...

46:49.282 --> 46:51.011
for the murder of six Boer prisoners?

46:51.083 --> 46:52.141
I am.

46:52.218 --> 46:54.686
Would it not be in your best interest...

46:54.754 --> 46:57.723
to suggest that orders were given
that Boer prisoners be shot?

46:57.790 --> 47:00.122
Are you saying I'm lying, Major?

47:00.726 --> 47:03.593
- Just answer my questions, Captain.
- You answer mine.

47:03.663 --> 47:08.066
You are answering questions, Capt. Taylor.
Maj. Bolton is asking them.

47:10.469 --> 47:12.960
I suppose it could appear that way.

47:15.007 --> 47:16.338
Thank you.

47:16.409 --> 47:18.809
That will be all, Capt. Taylor.

47:19.879 --> 47:21.437
Lights out!

47:29.889 --> 47:34.826
Three cheers for
His Majesty King Edward Vll!

47:35.561 --> 47:37.461
Long may he reign!

47:38.197 --> 47:40.688
- Hip-hip!
- Hurrah!

47:46.439 --> 47:49.237
<i>I think it's wonderful,
George going to South Africa.</i>

47:49.308 --> 47:52.209
<i>- Join the Army and see the world.
- He's so young...</i>

47:57.750 --> 48:00.878
Honor, glory, and a safe return.

48:26.779 --> 48:29.612
I'm not much of a letter writer, you know.

48:30.116 --> 48:33.279
If you ever heard from me,
it would probably be bad news.

48:49.502 --> 48:53.063
<i>When I have lived</i>

48:53.306 --> 48:56.969
<i>long years in vain</i>

48:57.276 --> 49:03.146
<i>And found life's garlands rue</i>

49:05.017 --> 49:10.922
<i>Maybe that I'll come back</i>

49:11.791 --> 49:15.249
<i>dear girl</i>

49:16.429 --> 49:18.124
<i>At last</i>

49:18.764 --> 49:23.724
<i>At last to you</i>

49:24.704 --> 49:30.540
<i>Maybe that I'll come back</i>

49:32.778 --> 49:35.246
<i>dear girl</i>

49:36.315 --> 49:38.442
<i>At last</i>

49:39.185 --> 49:45.124
<i>At last to you</i>

50:46.919 --> 50:48.477
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

50:48.554 --> 50:50.317
I can't understand you...

50:55.161 --> 50:57.026
One week from tonight?

51:04.837 --> 51:06.828
Our blokes have come to rescue us.

51:06.906 --> 51:08.771
Don't be bloody silly.

51:09.775 --> 51:11.538
It's a Boer attack.

51:53.419 --> 51:55.979
I'm not sure I like you blokes
enough to help you.

53:27.179 --> 53:29.272
That broke the monotony, didn't it?

53:29.682 --> 53:30.842
Irrelevant.

53:30.916 --> 53:33.578
The defendants were called upon
to do their duty, no more.

53:33.652 --> 53:36.143
Sir, the Duke of Wellington stated:

53:36.288 --> 53:38.620
"The performance of a duty
of honor and trust...

53:38.691 --> 53:41.717
"after knowledge of military offense
ought to convey a pardon."

53:41.794 --> 53:44.786
What on earth does his statement
have to do with military law?

53:44.863 --> 53:48.321
I will tolerate no further mention
of this morning's events in this court.

53:48.400 --> 53:53.269
But, sir, the Duke of Wellington influenced
nearly all our military law.

53:53.339 --> 53:55.830
- Why bother, Major?
- Order.

53:56.242 --> 53:59.871
We'll proceed with the second charge,
concerning the six Boer prisoners...

53:59.945 --> 54:03.210
killed at Fort Edward on August 23, 1901.

54:03.449 --> 54:06.976
Anyway, it was dark. Pitch dark.
Not even a moon. Couldn't see a thing.

54:07.052 --> 54:10.488
But a bet is a bet,
and £50 is a hell of a lot of money.

54:10.556 --> 54:13.753
Mind you, I'd had a few drinks.
Quite a few drinks.

54:14.460 --> 54:17.918
Anyway, there's the fence. Cast iron.
Seven foot high.

54:18.998 --> 54:21.899
Spikes on the top.
It was so dark, I couldn't even see it...

54:21.967 --> 54:24.834
- so we put some candles on the top.
- And you cleared it.

54:24.903 --> 54:26.803
- You've heard it before?
- We all have.

54:26.872 --> 54:28.533
Yes, I cleared it and I won the bet.

54:28.607 --> 54:31.041
I paid off all my debts in...
Where the hell was it?

54:31.110 --> 54:32.907
- Canada.
- Canada. Thank you very much.

54:32.978 --> 54:34.172
And I got the...

54:34.246 --> 54:36.771
- He ought to be on the other side.
- Why is that?

54:36.849 --> 54:38.942
He's a big enough bore, ain't he?

54:39.952 --> 54:42.750
There's a group of Boers coming in.
They've got white flags.

54:42.821 --> 54:45.790
That's an old one.
We get close and they blow our heads off.

54:45.858 --> 54:48.156
Not this lot. They look really shabby.

54:48.627 --> 54:52.859
In that case, another few three feet,
go back out in the veldt and snipe at them.

54:52.931 --> 54:55.456
Sgt. Maj. Drummond. Take more troopers.

54:55.534 --> 54:58.059
- Cpl. Sharp, take his post.
- Right, sir.

55:35.207 --> 55:38.233
They're part of the group
that killed Simon Hunt.

55:38.310 --> 55:39.299
How can you be sure?

55:39.378 --> 55:43.815
Kelly's commandos. The rest disbanded
or moved into Portuguese territory.

55:44.450 --> 55:45.883
Execute them.

55:47.152 --> 55:50.588
- Aren't we supposed to...
- This is guerilla war, not a debutante's ball.

55:50.656 --> 55:53.523
- There are no rules here.
- Blast that man.

55:57.696 --> 56:00.062
George, tell Handcock
to get a squad together...

56:00.132 --> 56:02.965
after the old man's left, will you? Go on.

56:08.807 --> 56:11.435
You got to get
a firing squad together, Peter.

56:11.510 --> 56:12.602
For?

56:12.678 --> 56:14.441
It's wrong, mate, and you know it is.

56:14.513 --> 56:18.244
Don't argue this with me, mate.
I just follow orders.

56:19.918 --> 56:21.579
Hey, look at this.

56:22.988 --> 56:24.979
I got these from that lot.

56:26.091 --> 56:27.353
Dumdums.

56:28.260 --> 56:30.353
Ever seen what they can do?

56:31.029 --> 56:32.929
Put a neat little hole here...

56:32.998 --> 56:35.831
and at the back, boom. All gone, nothing.

56:37.136 --> 56:40.071
Don't talk to me
about what's right or wrong.

56:52.785 --> 56:55.219
- Morning, Lieutenant.
- Morning, Mr. Hesse.

56:55.287 --> 56:57.278
- Who are these men?
- Boer prisoners, sir.

56:57.356 --> 57:00.257
I'd rather you didn't speak to them.
You moving on today, sir?

57:00.325 --> 57:04.159
As soon as I get some water for my men,
I'll proceed for Leydsdorp.

57:04.396 --> 57:05.363
Leydsdorp?

57:05.898 --> 57:07.991
- Boer guerilla country, sir.
- Yes.

57:08.167 --> 57:12.729
But they do not bother a harmless old man
who is spreading the word of God.

57:31.089 --> 57:34.422
But the white flag.
They came in under a white flag.

57:35.060 --> 57:37.620
Do you remember the order
from Pretoria High Command?

57:37.696 --> 57:40.722
If they show a white flag, we don't see it.
I didn't see it.

57:40.799 --> 57:44.166
Harry, you never gave a damn for orders
if you didn't agree with them.

57:44.236 --> 57:47.603
- You're doing this to avenge Capt. Hunt.
- You're probably right, lad.

57:47.673 --> 57:51.109
It won't bring him back,
but it's the next best thing.

57:59.952 --> 58:02.819
Mr. Hesse, sir. You spoke to the prisoners?

58:03.155 --> 58:05.419
I gave you strict instructions not to, sir.

58:05.491 --> 58:09.222
I'm sorry, Lt. Morant.
They called me to pray for them.

58:09.294 --> 58:12.855
The Boers are religious men.
I could not refuse.

58:31.483 --> 58:32.643
Ready!

58:55.240 --> 58:56.332
Fire!

59:04.683 --> 59:08.175
I propose to settle once and for all, sir...

59:08.287 --> 59:12.018
the matter of whether or not
orders were issued to shoot prisoners.

59:12.090 --> 59:13.887
Do you, Maj. Thomas?

59:14.293 --> 59:17.126
Maj. Bolton has proved
there were no standing orders...

59:17.195 --> 59:19.186
and Capt. Hunt is dead.

59:32.044 --> 59:35.980
A formal request that Lord Kitchener
attend this court-martial.

59:36.048 --> 59:38.278
Lord Kitchener?

59:39.251 --> 59:43.051
He can tell us himself whether or not
such orders were issued.

59:43.121 --> 59:45.419
You are impertinent, Maj. Thomas.

59:45.490 --> 59:49.153
Are you suggesting that
the most senior soldier in the British Army...

59:49.227 --> 59:52.162
a man venerated throughout the world...

59:52.431 --> 59:55.889
would be capable of issuing an order
of such barbarity?

59:58.670 --> 01:00:00.331
I don't know, sir.

01:00:04.042 --> 01:00:05.634
But I do know...

01:00:06.345 --> 01:00:09.439
that orders
that one would consider barbarous...

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:12.276
have already been issued in this war.

01:00:12.451 --> 01:00:15.352
Before I was asked to defend these men...

01:00:15.887 --> 01:00:20.415
I spent some months
burning Boer farmhouses...

01:00:21.093 --> 01:00:23.084
destroying their crops...

01:00:23.195 --> 01:00:27.291
herding their women and children
into stinking refugee camps...

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.061
where thousands of them
have died already from disease.

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:35.602
Now, these orders were issued, sir...

01:00:36.008 --> 01:00:39.808
and soldiers like myself
and these men here...

01:00:39.878 --> 01:00:43.336
have had to carry them out,
however damned reluctantly!

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:47.212
There is no precedent for this request.

01:00:47.586 --> 01:00:51.682
There is no obligation whatever
for Lord Kitchener to attend this courtroom.

01:00:56.728 --> 01:01:01.392
"The accused is allowed full liberty
to cross-examine any witness against him...

01:01:01.466 --> 01:01:03.661
"and to call any witnesses...

01:01:03.735 --> 01:01:06.795
"or make any statement in his defense."

01:01:22.421 --> 01:01:23.945
May I join you?

01:01:30.095 --> 01:01:33.895
Well, our little case seems to be attracting
quite a lot of interest.

01:01:33.965 --> 01:01:37.298
Yes. Been requests
from some of those correspondent fellows...

01:01:37.369 --> 01:01:40.497
to attend the court.
All turned down, of course.

01:01:41.006 --> 01:01:42.268
Of course.

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:46.242
I've been wondering if you realize
how anxious your own government is...

01:01:46.311 --> 01:01:47.369
for a conviction.

01:01:47.446 --> 01:01:50.506
- What do you mean?
- Well, you've just become a commonwealth.

01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:53.745
Your prime minister,
Mr. Barton, wants to dissipate...

01:01:53.819 --> 01:01:57.880
any lingering impressions
of a frontier colony. Frontier behavior.

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:02.826
You can be quite sure their conviction
will meet with Australian approval.

01:02:03.061 --> 01:02:06.588
- Of course Morant and his friends are guilty.
- Are they?

01:02:06.665 --> 01:02:10.032
Why not arrest the firing squad?
They did the actual killing.

01:02:10.102 --> 01:02:11.831
But they were following Morant's orders.

01:02:11.903 --> 01:02:15.100
That's right.
Just as Morant was following orders.

01:02:16.241 --> 01:02:18.709
You do realize
that when High Command denies...

01:02:18.777 --> 01:02:21.746
that the orders were issued,
your whole case will collapse.

01:02:21.813 --> 01:02:24.577
Perhaps your request that Lord Kitchener
attend this court...

01:02:24.649 --> 01:02:27.743
- is not in your clients' best interest.
- I had thought of that.

01:02:27.819 --> 01:02:30.549
- Then you will withdraw the request?
- No.

01:02:34.593 --> 01:02:37.585
It seems quite simple to me.
I don't know how it's come to this.

01:02:37.662 --> 01:02:41.063
- You said our fellow there, that Irishman...
- Capt. Taylor, sir.

01:02:41.133 --> 01:02:43.294
- Anglo-lrish.
- Taylor, yes...

01:02:43.368 --> 01:02:46.337
assured you the case against
the Australians was overwhelming.

01:02:46.404 --> 01:02:49.862
Now he seems to spend most of his time
giving evidence on their behalf.

01:02:49.941 --> 01:02:52.603
Certain proprieties have to be observed, sir.

01:02:52.677 --> 01:02:55.703
And Taylor fought with Morant,
it creates a bond.

01:02:55.781 --> 01:02:57.442
I don't think he's the problem.

01:02:57.516 --> 01:03:00.508
Maj. Thomas is putting up
an unexpectedly good defense.

01:03:00.585 --> 01:03:03.748
Two of the court members are showing
sympathy for the Australians.

01:03:03.822 --> 01:03:06.985
I daresay it's too late
to transfer them to India?

01:03:07.159 --> 01:03:08.751
I did mention at one time, sir...

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:12.991
the complexities of charging soldiers with
murder while they're actually in the field.

01:03:13.064 --> 01:03:16.898
Good God, Johnny, I'm not trying to prove
some academic point.

01:03:17.736 --> 01:03:20.728
I'm trying to put an end to this useless war.

01:03:20.939 --> 01:03:23.567
The Boer leaders must see
in this court-martial...

01:03:23.642 --> 01:03:26.543
the demonstration of our impartial justice.

01:03:27.412 --> 01:03:30.142
If these three Australians have to be...

01:03:31.483 --> 01:03:34.850
sacrificed to help bring about
a peace conference...

01:03:35.987 --> 01:03:38.455
- it's a small price to pay.
- I quite agree, sir.

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:41.822
Though I doubt the Australians
share our enthusiasm.

01:03:43.728 --> 01:03:45.923
You go to Pietersburg, Johnny.

01:03:46.731 --> 01:03:49.791
You deal with the order
to shoot the prisoners.

01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:52.025
What do I say?

01:03:53.071 --> 01:03:55.266
I think you know what to say.

01:03:58.343 --> 01:04:00.072
Shall be the truth...

01:04:00.946 --> 01:04:02.641
the whole truth...

01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:04.841
and nothing but the truth.

01:04:05.817 --> 01:04:09.344
Thank you, sir. If you'd like to take
the witness chair, please.

01:04:23.902 --> 01:04:28.532
Col. Hamilton, last July,
Capt. Hunt took two polo ponies...

01:04:28.607 --> 01:04:31.599
to Lord Kitchener's headquarters in Pretoria.

01:04:31.843 --> 01:04:36.337
At which time, you had a conversation
with him regarding war prisoners.

01:04:36.915 --> 01:04:39.247
Do you recall that conversation?

01:04:40.151 --> 01:04:42.483
I have no recollection whatever.

01:04:43.288 --> 01:04:46.451
I have never spoken to Capt. Hunt
with reference to his duties...

01:04:46.524 --> 01:04:48.549
in the Northern Transvaal.

01:04:48.994 --> 01:04:50.291
- You're a liar!
- Order!

01:04:50.362 --> 01:04:53.729
- You are under oath, sir.
- I am aware of that.

01:04:55.333 --> 01:04:59.269
Maj. Thomas, I trust you'll agree
that closes the issue of the alleged orders...

01:04:59.337 --> 01:05:01.066
to shoot prisoners.

01:05:11.249 --> 01:05:13.046
On the contrary, sir.

01:05:14.052 --> 01:05:17.647
I regard Col. Hamilton's denial...

01:05:18.256 --> 01:05:21.817
as having no bearing at all on the defense.

01:05:23.361 --> 01:05:26.728
I submit that it is, in fact...

01:05:27.299 --> 01:05:29.164
inadmissible evidence.

01:05:31.903 --> 01:05:35.066
A conversation
is stated to have taken place...

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:38.837
between Capt. Hunt and Col. Hamilton.

01:05:40.378 --> 01:05:44.405
Which conversation was relayed
by Capt. Hunt...

01:05:45.216 --> 01:05:47.013
to Lt. Morant.

01:05:47.752 --> 01:05:52.086
Now it really doesn't matter from whom
Capt. Hunt had his instructions.

01:05:52.157 --> 01:05:56.321
The fact is clear from the evidence
that Capt. Hunt did tell his subordinates...

01:05:56.394 --> 01:05:59.090
not once, but several times...

01:05:59.264 --> 01:06:01.459
that no prisoners were to be taken.

01:06:01.533 --> 01:06:05.162
This fact is admitted by witnesses
for the prosecution.

01:06:06.938 --> 01:06:11.068
Capt. Hunt's instructions
were entitled to be obeyed...

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:15.168
which goes to remove any suggestion...

01:06:15.246 --> 01:06:18.613
of malicious intention
on the part of the defendants.

01:06:19.351 --> 01:06:22.843
This entire court-martial, sir,
should be dismissed.

01:06:24.756 --> 01:06:26.155
Let us pray.

01:06:27.625 --> 01:06:30.753
O Lord of Hosts, we entreat thy blessing...

01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:34.993
for the soldiers of our race
called to do battle in South Africa.

01:06:35.333 --> 01:06:38.632
Be thou a strong tower for them
against the enemy.

01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:41.495
O thou who dost accomplish thy will...

01:06:41.573 --> 01:06:44.007
by war as well as by peace.

01:06:50.281 --> 01:06:53.876
I used to hate Sundays in Melbourne.
No trams or anything.

01:06:54.319 --> 01:06:57.811
On a hot day, you couldn't even
get down to St. Kilda's for a swim.

01:06:57.889 --> 01:07:00.483
- Did you have family readings?
- No.

01:07:01.226 --> 01:07:02.420
We did.

01:07:02.994 --> 01:07:07.021
I had to sit in a high-backed chair
wearing a white lace collar...

01:07:07.632 --> 01:07:11.159
<i>while my father read
selections from Pilgrim's Progress.</i>

01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:16.901
"How glorious it was to see
the open region filled with horses...

01:07:17.876 --> 01:07:20.003
"with trumpeters and pipers...

01:07:20.645 --> 01:07:24.979
"with singers and players..." etc.

01:07:26.351 --> 01:07:29.479
Sunday was a good day
for chasing a few tarts around Bathurst.

01:07:30.955 --> 01:07:33.082
Everyone else was in church.

01:07:33.658 --> 01:07:37.253
I used to whip down the riverbank
for a bit of smooching.

01:07:38.129 --> 01:07:40.791
Worst thing about dying, no more girls.

01:07:40.865 --> 01:07:43.425
Well, coming up for the homestretch.

01:07:43.701 --> 01:07:46.727
- Any news of the other two cases?
- No, nothing.

01:07:46.805 --> 01:07:51.037
In my view, everything hinges
on the last one. The German missionary.

01:07:52.243 --> 01:07:55.872
- You sticking with that story?
- Why, what's wrong with it?

01:07:56.247 --> 01:07:58.772
Damn it, man.
He leaves Fort Edward in a cart.

01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:00.977
A few hours later, you leave with a rifle.

01:08:01.052 --> 01:08:04.988
In the morning, he's dead,
and you trot out some fairytale...

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:08.721
about shooting game.

01:08:17.402 --> 01:08:20.303
- We don't have to give evidence, do we?
- No.

01:08:20.438 --> 01:08:23.532
But refusal will be equivalent
to an admission of guilt.

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:33.182
I was in a public house
a few nights ago, sir.

01:08:33.251 --> 01:08:35.446
- Were you, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.353
I was standing near one of the witnesses.
In his cups, he was.

01:08:38.423 --> 01:08:40.823
A very indiscreet gentlemen, sir.

01:08:47.064 --> 01:08:52.002
<i>We will proceed, gentlemen,
with the final one of the three charges.</i>

01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:55.398
<i>The death of the Rev. H.C. V. Hesse.</i>

01:08:55.907 --> 01:09:00.173
<i>Lts. Morant and Handcock
have pleaded not guilty respectively...</i>

01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:03.872
<i>to inciting and committing the murder.
Maj. Bolton.</i>

01:09:03.948 --> 01:09:05.415
You realize you're under oath...

01:09:05.483 --> 01:09:07.576
- Cpl. Sharp.
- Yes, sir. Right, sir.

01:09:07.652 --> 01:09:09.779
This bloke'd say anything
except his prayers.

01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:12.118
On August 23 last...

01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:15.282
that being the last day
Rev. Hesse was seen alive...

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.953
you were on sentry duty. Is that correct?

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:22.090
- That is correct, sir.
- Did you see the deceased that day?

01:09:23.468 --> 01:09:24.799
What, sir?

01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:28.332
The deceased. The Rev. Hesse.

01:09:28.805 --> 01:09:31.296
Yes, sir, I saw the deceased that day.

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:32.899
<i>It was about 10:00 a.m.</i>

01:09:32.977 --> 01:09:36.640
Lovely day, sir. We could do with
a drop of this weather in London.

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:39.080
Thank you very much.
It gets very foggy there, sir.

01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:42.142
You can't see a foot in front of your face.
That's a hand, see?

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.654
It's a joke. Silly old bugger.

01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:46.747
I hope you drown in your Communion wine.

01:09:46.823 --> 01:09:49.987
I checked the deceased's pass, sir.
It was signed by Capt. Taylor.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.460
Then he went off, sir.

01:09:51.529 --> 01:09:54.464
- You never saw him again?
- The deceased, sir?

01:09:55.133 --> 01:09:56.862
No, sir, not again.

01:09:57.635 --> 01:10:01.298
Did you witness anything else
which might affect this court-martial?

01:10:01.372 --> 01:10:04.170
Yes, sir. Barely half an hour later, sir...

01:10:04.576 --> 01:10:07.374
<i>Lt. Handcock rode up to Lt. Morant, sir.</i>

01:10:07.445 --> 01:10:10.243
<i>It was just alongside the tent line, sir.</i>

01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:26.427
How did Lt. Handcock look?

01:10:28.066 --> 01:10:31.797
Like he was thinking, sir. Like...

01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:36.130
- I can't think of a...
- Did he look like he was agitated?

01:10:36.207 --> 01:10:39.142
Agitated? Yes.
That's it, sir, he looked agitated...

01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:41.269
Objection!
Maj. Bolton is leading the witness.

01:10:41.346 --> 01:10:43.780
I will rephrase the question, sir.

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:47.808
Tell me, Cpl. Sharp...

01:10:48.086 --> 01:10:50.179
how did Lt. Handcock look?

01:10:50.255 --> 01:10:52.120
- Agitated, sir.
- Thank you.

01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:54.715
Is there anything else
that you wish to tell the court?

01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:57.590
No, sir. Yes, sir.

01:10:58.863 --> 01:11:01.229
They, sir, Lts. Morant and Handcock...

01:11:01.299 --> 01:11:02.960
weren't like real soldiers.

01:11:03.034 --> 01:11:07.596
Troopers actually called them
by their first name. Right to their face, sir.

01:11:08.406 --> 01:11:11.034
- Thank you, that will be all.
- Thank you, sir.

01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:19.147
Why did you leave
the Bushveldt Carbineers?

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:21.377
I requested a transfer, sir.

01:11:21.586 --> 01:11:24.180
Were you not made to transfer?

01:11:24.789 --> 01:11:29.590
Weren't you punished by Lt. Handcock
for stealing Boer property while on patrol?

01:11:33.898 --> 01:11:37.698
I can have your charge sheet
brought into the court, Corporal.

01:11:38.403 --> 01:11:40.394
Yes, sir. It's true, sir.

01:11:42.707 --> 01:11:46.700
And have you not been stating
in the hotels of Pietersburg...

01:11:46.778 --> 01:11:50.578
that you would walk barefoot
from Cape Town to Pietersburg...

01:11:50.648 --> 01:11:54.209
to be on a firing party
to shoot Lt. Handcock?

01:11:56.321 --> 01:12:00.985
Might have said that over a pint, sir,
but it was only a bit of beer talking, not me.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.253
You testified previously...

01:12:04.462 --> 01:12:08.262
that you told the Rev. Hesse not to speak
with Boer prisoners. Why was that?

01:12:08.333 --> 01:12:11.268
He was German. It was for security reasons.

01:12:11.936 --> 01:12:14.427
But we are not at war with Germany.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:19.101
Every soldier is aware of the sympathy
that Germany shows toward the Boers.

01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:24.348
Were you on good terms
with the Rev. Hesse?

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:26.516
Just cordial.

01:12:27.218 --> 01:12:29.015
When he left Fort Edward...

01:12:29.087 --> 01:12:32.989
you knew that he was going to report
back here to the authorities in Pietersburg.

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:35.025
I couldn't know what he was going to do.

01:12:35.093 --> 01:12:39.325
But it would have been in your interest,
would it not, to prevent it?

01:12:40.164 --> 01:12:42.155
I hardly know about that.

01:12:42.266 --> 01:12:44.666
All I do know is that someone
prevented him...

01:12:44.736 --> 01:12:46.863
and I'm still here on trial.

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:52.031
I suggest that you instructed Lt. Handcock...

01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:54.908
to follow the Rev. Hesse and to shoot him.

01:12:54.979 --> 01:12:58.142
I had sent a message
to Col. Hall in Pietersburg...

01:12:58.216 --> 01:13:01.083
informing him of my intentions
towards the Boer prisoners.

01:13:01.152 --> 01:13:03.017
I have nothing to hide.

01:13:03.154 --> 01:13:06.282
I find that statement hard to believe.

01:13:06.524 --> 01:13:11.086
Then I suggest that you recall Col. Hall
from India. He will confirm it.

01:13:12.130 --> 01:13:13.927
I don't mind waiting.

01:13:15.466 --> 01:13:18.333
Thank you, Lt. Morant, that will be all.

01:13:18.403 --> 01:13:19.700
Thank you, sir.

01:13:20.238 --> 01:13:23.605
Call Lt. Handcock
to the witness chair, please.

01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:29.812
I would like to request an adjournment, sir,
until tomorrow morning.

01:13:29.881 --> 01:13:33.908
Do I understand, Maj. Thomas,
that Lt. Handcock won't be giving evidence?

01:13:33.985 --> 01:13:38.217
No, sir, I simply need more time
to discuss the case with my client.

01:13:38.289 --> 01:13:40.280
I have no objection, sir.

01:13:41.559 --> 01:13:43.117
Request granted.

01:13:49.734 --> 01:13:52.532
For God's sake, tell me the truth, Peter.

01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:55.333
If you're concealing something,
I want to know it.

01:13:55.406 --> 01:13:57.897
If you killed Hesse, I want to know.

01:13:59.544 --> 01:14:03.071
It's not just your life.
You'll take Morant and Witton with you.

01:14:03.147 --> 01:14:06.412
- We got no bloody chance anyway.
- I think you have.

01:14:06.851 --> 01:14:10.014
They obviously regard this
as the most serious charge.

01:14:10.121 --> 01:14:12.646
If I can convince the court members...

01:14:12.723 --> 01:14:16.955
that you're innocent on this one,
I think you could all be acquitted.

01:14:18.396 --> 01:14:21.797
All right. But we got to be careful.

01:14:22.433 --> 01:14:25.061
- I don't want these witnesses in court.
- Why not?

01:14:25.136 --> 01:14:28.037
- Do you want to be executed?
- Of course not.

01:14:28.206 --> 01:14:30.697
But I made a promise. Two promises.

01:14:37.949 --> 01:14:40.349
Where did you go
when you left Fort Edward...

01:14:40.418 --> 01:14:42.750
approximately half an hour
after the Rev. Hesse?

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:45.414
- I went visiting.
- Visiting?

01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:48.381
Who could you possibly have visited?

01:14:48.459 --> 01:14:51.428
I went to the farms
owned by the Shields and the Vanderbergs.

01:14:51.496 --> 01:14:54.226
- Why? Who was at these farms?
- Nobody.

01:14:54.732 --> 01:14:56.324
I knew the ladies, sir.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:59.858
And they received you
into their homes alone?

01:15:00.872 --> 01:15:02.897
I was quite well-known to them.

01:15:03.908 --> 01:15:06.433
You mean to tell me
you were on intimate terms...

01:15:06.511 --> 01:15:08.069
with two Boer ladies?

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.812
Yeah, you could put it that way.

01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:14.747
Where were the husbands?

01:15:14.819 --> 01:15:17.913
One's a prisoner of war
and the other's with the Boer commandos.

01:15:17.989 --> 01:15:19.889
I was checking if they were all right.

01:15:36.107 --> 01:15:38.268
- Handcock!
- Good day.

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.312
Pretty glad to see me?

01:16:00.364 --> 01:16:03.265
You spent the full afternoon
at these ladies' homes?

01:16:03.334 --> 01:16:06.895
My oath. It was about 5:00
when I got to the Shields' place.

01:16:09.574 --> 01:16:12.099
Good day, Mrs. Shields, here you go.

01:16:13.277 --> 01:16:15.541
I'll just have a cup of coffee.

01:16:15.613 --> 01:16:17.808
I'm tired, I've been riding all day.

01:16:20.718 --> 01:16:22.618
Okay, you talked me into it.

01:16:28.092 --> 01:16:29.787
I would like to present the court...

01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:33.489
with written depositions
from both the ladies in question.

01:16:58.689 --> 01:17:01.214
Lt. Handcock, what does...

01:17:01.292 --> 01:17:04.784
Mrs. Vanderberg mean by "entertain"?

01:17:05.896 --> 01:17:07.659
Did you sing to her?

01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:13.102
Sir, you can appreciate that these ladies'
reputations are in a vulnerable position...

01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:17.229
and as these letters confirm
Lt. Handcock's whereabouts...

01:17:17.308 --> 01:17:19.071
on the day in question...

01:17:19.143 --> 01:17:23.045
could they not forgo the embarrassment
of actually appearing in court?

01:17:23.114 --> 01:17:25.844
- Maj. Bolton?
- I have no objection, sir.

01:17:27.551 --> 01:17:30.247
I must say I find this sort of behavior...

01:17:30.321 --> 01:17:32.585
from a soldier in the British Army...

01:17:32.657 --> 01:17:34.420
morally disgraceful.

01:17:35.292 --> 01:17:37.260
These were married women.

01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:40.421
They say
a slice off a cut loaf is never missed.

01:17:41.399 --> 01:17:45.096
Lt. Handcock's personal morality
is not on trial, sir.

01:17:46.137 --> 01:17:47.604
Rather aggressive bloke.

01:17:59.817 --> 01:18:02.615
Who do you think did kill the missionary?

01:18:05.456 --> 01:18:06.480
Me.

01:18:09.727 --> 01:18:11.922
What about your lady friends?

01:18:12.029 --> 01:18:13.553
That was later.

01:18:14.031 --> 01:18:16.158
- Does Maj. Thomas know?
- No.

01:18:17.168 --> 01:18:19.068
And he's not going to.

01:18:21.772 --> 01:18:23.467
But we've always told the truth.

01:18:23.541 --> 01:18:27.443
Maj. Thomas has been pleading justifying
circumstances and now we're just lying!

01:18:27.511 --> 01:18:28.910
We're lying?

01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:30.937
What about them?

01:18:31.015 --> 01:18:35.884
It's no bloody secret our graves were dug
the day they arrested us at Fort Edward.

01:18:36.353 --> 01:18:38.651
Yeah, but killing a missionary, Peter.

01:18:38.723 --> 01:18:41.021
It's a new kind of war, George.

01:18:42.159 --> 01:18:44.559
It's a new war for a new century.

01:18:45.496 --> 01:18:49.557
I suppose this is the first time
the enemy hasn't been in uniform.

01:18:49.667 --> 01:18:51.259
They're farmers.

01:18:51.535 --> 01:18:53.867
They're people from small towns.

01:18:53.971 --> 01:18:57.031
They shoot at us from houses
and from paddocks.

01:18:57.108 --> 01:19:01.374
Some of them are women, some of them
are children, and some of them...

01:19:01.779 --> 01:19:03.747
are missionaries, George.

01:19:04.982 --> 01:19:07.416
- That minister was talking to the prisoners.
- I know.

01:19:07.485 --> 01:19:11.182
I'm damn certain that Hesse was the one
who led Simon Hunt into that trap.

01:19:11.255 --> 01:19:14.486
- Now he tells me he's off to Leydsdorp.
- Leydsdorp?

01:19:15.159 --> 01:19:17.423
Anything can happen
on the way to Leydsdorp.

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:32.025
The main fact of this case...

01:20:33.671 --> 01:20:36.196
that Boer prisoners were executed...

01:20:37.274 --> 01:20:39.868
has never been denied by the defense.

01:20:41.178 --> 01:20:42.509
However...

01:20:43.681 --> 01:20:47.947
I feel that that there is no evidence
at all for bringing charges...

01:20:48.219 --> 01:20:50.687
against Lt. Witton.

01:20:52.022 --> 01:20:53.751
A junior officer...

01:20:53.958 --> 01:20:57.951
who had no reason to question
the instructions of his superiors.

01:20:59.663 --> 01:21:01.460
And his only crime...

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:04.424
was that he shot a Boer...

01:21:05.102 --> 01:21:06.694
in self-defense.

01:21:07.538 --> 01:21:09.028
And further...

01:21:09.707 --> 01:21:13.973
no one denies the admirable
fighting qualities of the Boers...

01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:17.274
nor, in general...

01:21:18.215 --> 01:21:20.046
their sense of honor.

01:21:23.988 --> 01:21:25.319
However...

01:21:26.257 --> 01:21:29.420
those Boers fighting
in the Northern Transvaal...

01:21:29.493 --> 01:21:31.290
in commando groups...

01:21:32.429 --> 01:21:35.091
are outlaws, renegades.

01:21:36.333 --> 01:21:40.292
Often without
any recognized form of control.

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:44.332
Addicted to the wrecking of trains,
the looting of farms.

01:21:45.542 --> 01:21:47.533
Lord Kitchener himself...

01:21:47.678 --> 01:21:51.409
recognized the unorthodox nature
of this warfare...

01:21:51.482 --> 01:21:54.542
when he formed a special squad
to deal with it.

01:21:55.686 --> 01:21:57.677
The Bushveldt Carbineers.

01:21:58.822 --> 01:22:01.916
Now, when the rules and customs of war...

01:22:02.293 --> 01:22:04.853
are departed from by one side...

01:22:06.931 --> 01:22:09.923
one must expect the same sort of behavior...

01:22:11.068 --> 01:22:12.592
from the other.

01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:17.703
Accordingly, officers of the Carbineers
should be...

01:22:18.075 --> 01:22:19.633
and up until now, have been...

01:22:19.710 --> 01:22:23.908
given the widest possible discretion
in their treatment of the enemy.

01:22:24.315 --> 01:22:27.614
Now I don't ask...

01:22:28.085 --> 01:22:32.317
for proclamations condoning
distasteful methods of war.

01:22:34.191 --> 01:22:35.715
But I do say...

01:22:35.926 --> 01:22:39.623
that we must take for granted
that it does happen.

01:22:40.965 --> 01:22:44.765
Let's not give our officers hazy,
vague instructions...

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:47.360
about what they may and may not do.

01:22:47.438 --> 01:22:48.837
Let's not...

01:22:49.506 --> 01:22:52.031
reprimand them on the one hand...

01:22:52.109 --> 01:22:55.101
for hampering the column with prisoners...

01:22:55.713 --> 01:22:57.578
and at another time...

01:22:58.382 --> 01:23:00.145
and another place...

01:23:02.219 --> 01:23:03.743
haul them up...

01:23:04.755 --> 01:23:06.279
as murderers...

01:23:08.959 --> 01:23:10.688
for obeying orders.

01:23:21.005 --> 01:23:24.668
Lt. Morant shot no prisoners...

01:23:25.509 --> 01:23:27.909
before the death of Capt. Hunt.

01:23:30.047 --> 01:23:32.277
He then changed a good deal...

01:23:33.450 --> 01:23:37.443
and adopted the sternest possible measures
against the enemy.

01:23:39.823 --> 01:23:42.656
Yet there is no evidence to suggest...

01:23:44.194 --> 01:23:48.631
that Lt. Morant has
an intrinsically barbarous nature.

01:23:52.036 --> 01:23:53.628
On the contrary.

01:23:54.938 --> 01:23:57.065
The fact of the matter is...

01:23:57.307 --> 01:24:00.868
that war changes men's natures.

01:24:03.814 --> 01:24:05.805
The barbarities of war...

01:24:06.216 --> 01:24:09.549
are seldom committed by abnormal men.

01:24:12.056 --> 01:24:14.047
The tragedy of war is...

01:24:14.124 --> 01:24:17.287
that these horrors
are committed by normal men...

01:24:17.861 --> 01:24:19.761
in abnormal situations.

01:24:20.497 --> 01:24:22.328
Situations in which...

01:24:22.566 --> 01:24:26.434
the ebb and flow of everyday life
have departed...

01:24:27.738 --> 01:24:31.640
and have been replaced
by a constant round of fear...

01:24:32.242 --> 01:24:35.837
and anger and blood and death.

01:24:37.915 --> 01:24:39.906
Soldiers at war...

01:24:40.717 --> 01:24:44.448
are not to be judged by civilian rules.

01:24:48.892 --> 01:24:50.792
As the prosecution...

01:24:51.395 --> 01:24:53.260
is attempting to do.

01:24:54.665 --> 01:24:57.099
Even though they commit acts...

01:24:57.201 --> 01:25:00.227
which, calmly viewed afterwards...

01:25:01.772 --> 01:25:03.763
could only be seen...

01:25:04.508 --> 01:25:07.500
as unchristian and brutal.

01:25:08.545 --> 01:25:12.743
And if in every war,
particularly guerilla war...

01:25:13.584 --> 01:25:18.180
all the men who committed reprisals
were to be charged and tried...

01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:20.680
as murderers...

01:25:20.824 --> 01:25:24.521
court-martials like this one
would be in permanent session.

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:27.854
Would they not?

01:25:32.336 --> 01:25:33.564
I say...

01:25:35.472 --> 01:25:39.431
that we cannot hope to judge such matters...

01:25:40.377 --> 01:25:43.744
unless we ourselves...

01:25:44.581 --> 01:25:47.482
have been submitted
to the same pressures...

01:25:47.718 --> 01:25:49.686
the same provocations...

01:25:51.188 --> 01:25:52.712
as these men...

01:25:54.291 --> 01:25:56.384
whose actions are on trial.

01:26:19.316 --> 01:26:21.614
Steady, don't spill a drop.

01:26:21.952 --> 01:26:23.283
Thank you.

01:26:24.521 --> 01:26:26.546
To Bushveldt Carbineers...

01:26:26.657 --> 01:26:29.751
- the best fighters in a bad cause.
- Bloody hell.

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:33.823
- Where the hell did you get this from?
- One of the jock guards.

01:26:33.897 --> 01:26:37.890
- What do you mean, a bad cause?
- I thought we cleared up all their stills.

01:26:37.968 --> 01:26:40.937
Sorry.
The bad cause was the Boer War, you know.

01:26:41.004 --> 01:26:43.666
Half a million men
fighting a few thousand farmers.

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:46.334
Every bugger we kicked
out of the Carbineers came down...

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:48.071
You volunteered.

01:26:48.645 --> 01:26:53.048
You can't always choose which side
you're going to fight on, can you?

01:26:53.784 --> 01:26:57.276
And these days it's so very easy
to be on the wrong side.

01:26:57.354 --> 01:27:01.290
Especially if you leave Australia
one step ahead of the debt collectors.

01:27:01.558 --> 01:27:03.753
Watch your language.

01:27:04.394 --> 01:27:07.363
"When a man hath no freedom
to fight for at home

01:27:07.431 --> 01:27:10.264
"Let him combat for that of his neighbors

01:27:10.334 --> 01:27:13.997
"Let him think of the glories
of Greece and Rome

01:27:15.072 --> 01:27:18.098
"And get knock'd on the head for his labors

01:27:20.344 --> 01:27:25.043
"To do good to mankind
is the chivalrous plan

01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:29.014
"And is always as nobly requited

01:27:29.486 --> 01:27:33.115
"Then battle for freedom wherever you can

01:27:33.557 --> 01:27:37.084
"And, if not shot or hang'd

01:27:37.561 --> 01:27:39.426
"you'll get knighted"

01:27:40.897 --> 01:27:42.228
You write that, Harry?

01:27:42.299 --> 01:27:44.927
No, it was a minor poet called Byron.

01:27:45.102 --> 01:27:48.560
- Never heard of him.
- Like I said, he was a minor poet.

01:27:49.239 --> 01:27:51.332
I know some good poems, too.

01:27:51.742 --> 01:27:54.074
That surprised you, didn't it?

01:27:59.283 --> 01:28:02.013
"There once was a man from Australia

01:28:02.085 --> 01:28:04.485
"Who painted his ass like a dahlia

01:28:04.621 --> 01:28:08.352
"The color was fine, likewise the design

01:28:08.425 --> 01:28:11.451
"But the aroma, that was a failure"

01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:16.162
Champagne from two of the court members.

01:28:16.233 --> 01:28:18.497
You've been officially acquitted
on the Hesse case.

01:28:18.568 --> 01:28:20.160
You beauty!

01:28:20.937 --> 01:28:24.031
That's it, Harry. Why don't you
leave the dust around Bathurst!

01:28:25.409 --> 01:28:27.104
Don't get too carried away.

01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:29.668
You might still do a couple of years.

01:28:29.746 --> 01:28:34.046
It's better than a one-way trip to
kingdom come, isn't it? George, come here.

01:28:34.117 --> 01:28:36.278
Let's plunder the champagne.

01:28:38.322 --> 01:28:40.347
- Come on.
- I'm fine!

01:28:43.026 --> 01:28:44.823
To freedom and Australia.

01:28:46.830 --> 01:28:48.991
To freedom, Australia and horses.

01:28:51.335 --> 01:28:53.599
Freedom, Australia, horses and women!

01:28:55.706 --> 01:28:58.971
Live every day as if
it were going to be your last.

01:28:59.543 --> 01:29:02.034
One day, you're sure to be right.

01:29:02.112 --> 01:29:03.443
Can I have a word with you?

01:29:03.513 --> 01:29:05.845
We'll be home in time
for the Melbourne Cup.

01:29:05.916 --> 01:29:08.783
- Don't count your bridges.
- What do you mean by that?

01:29:08.852 --> 01:29:10.717
You said yourself...

01:29:12.989 --> 01:29:16.152
I wouldn't be too certain
of this verdict, Harry.

01:29:19.096 --> 01:29:22.793
And what about you?
Your trial is coming up soon, isn't it?

01:29:24.101 --> 01:29:25.830
They don't want me.

01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:29.237
Intelligence service,
Kitchener's staff, and all that.

01:29:29.306 --> 01:29:31.206
No, it wouldn't go down very well.

01:29:31.274 --> 01:29:34.266
But a wild, simple fellow like Handcock...

01:29:35.112 --> 01:29:38.513
and a... black sheep.

01:29:40.117 --> 01:29:42.517
- We won't be missed.
- That's right.

01:29:45.355 --> 01:29:49.917
I can have a horse standing by for you.
Some of the guards are sympathetic.

01:29:51.595 --> 01:29:53.392
And where would I go?

01:29:54.197 --> 01:29:56.825
Lorenzo Marques. Portuguese territory.

01:29:58.301 --> 01:30:01.600
Take a boat and see the world.

01:30:05.409 --> 01:30:06.876
I've seen it.

01:30:21.992 --> 01:30:23.186
Escort!

01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:25.152
Halt!

01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:27.594
Right turn.

01:30:40.343 --> 01:30:41.935
Mr. Witton, sir.

01:30:48.685 --> 01:30:50.653
Right turn, quick march.

01:31:04.067 --> 01:31:05.762
George Ramsdale Witton...

01:31:05.836 --> 01:31:09.602
you have been found guilty of murder
and sentenced to death.

01:31:10.173 --> 01:31:13.631
Lord Kitchener has been pleased
to commute your sentence...

01:31:13.710 --> 01:31:15.837
to penal servitude for life.

01:31:21.151 --> 01:31:23.449
Escort. Halt.

01:31:36.967 --> 01:31:38.366
Mr. Morant, sir.

01:31:49.613 --> 01:31:50.944
Left turn.

01:31:52.482 --> 01:31:54.109
Quick march.

01:32:01.391 --> 01:32:02.881
Harry Harbord Morant...

01:32:02.959 --> 01:32:06.690
you have been found guilty of murder
and sentenced to death.

01:32:11.868 --> 01:32:12.926
Sir.

01:32:34.257 --> 01:32:36.157
Shot, tomorrow morning.

01:32:52.642 --> 01:32:54.269
Mr. Handcock, sir.

01:33:28.612 --> 01:33:30.477
- Peter?
- Same as Morant.

01:33:50.066 --> 01:33:51.590
Can I help you, sir?

01:33:51.668 --> 01:33:54.603
- I wish to see Lord Kitchener.
- I'm afraid that's not possible.

01:33:54.671 --> 01:33:57.697
- Do you have an appointment, sir?
- I don't need an appointment.

01:33:57.774 --> 01:33:59.503
I demand to see him straightaway.

01:33:59.576 --> 01:34:01.703
The death warrants have been signed.

01:34:01.945 --> 01:34:03.378
There's nothing you can do.

01:34:03.446 --> 01:34:05.744
Let me see Lord Kitchener, sir.

01:34:05.882 --> 01:34:07.975
The trial was a bloody sham.

01:34:08.051 --> 01:34:10.747
Two members of the court
recommended mercy...

01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:13.653
for Handcock and Morant as well as Witton.

01:34:13.723 --> 01:34:16.487
In which case,
the casting vote belonged to the President...

01:34:16.559 --> 01:34:18.550
Lt. Col. Denny.

01:34:35.712 --> 01:34:38.408
Lord Kitchener's been called away
for a few days.

01:34:38.481 --> 01:34:41.644
Out on the veldt somewhere.
Quite un-contactable.

01:34:42.218 --> 01:34:44.311
I want a stay of execution.

01:34:44.754 --> 01:34:47.314
So that I can send a telegram to the King...

01:34:47.624 --> 01:34:49.558
and to the Australian Prime Minister.

01:34:49.626 --> 01:34:51.753
The sentence has been approved
by Whitehall...

01:34:51.828 --> 01:34:55.264
and the Australian government has
expressed its support of our decision.

01:34:55.331 --> 01:34:58.391
Forget it, Major. It's a sideshow of the war.

01:35:02.172 --> 01:35:04.037
I have some good news.

01:35:04.641 --> 01:35:07.633
There's hope of a peace conference
in a couple of months.

01:35:07.711 --> 01:35:09.679
Soon we can all go home.

01:35:26.696 --> 01:35:29.756
Could have had the decency
to measure us first.

01:35:30.667 --> 01:35:33.465
Don't suppose they've had
many complaints.

01:35:43.813 --> 01:35:46.509
<i>I'm going to find out the grand secret.</i>

01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:49.008
<i>I'll face my God...</i>

01:35:49.085 --> 01:35:53.749
<i>with the firm belief I obeyed my orders
and served my king as I thought best.</i>

01:35:54.357 --> 01:35:56.052
<i>If I overstepped my duty...</i>

01:35:56.126 --> 01:35:59.493
<i>I can only ask my people
and country for forgiveness.</i>

01:36:00.296 --> 01:36:02.787
<i>Take care of my little son at all cost.</i>

01:36:02.866 --> 01:36:04.561
<i>No matter what I may have done...</i>

01:36:04.634 --> 01:36:07.626
<i>you and he were the source
of my greatest joy.</i>

01:36:44.841 --> 01:36:46.934
"The night's a trifle chilly

01:36:47.010 --> 01:36:49.240
"and the stars are very bright

01:36:49.579 --> 01:36:51.570
"A heavy dew is falling

01:36:51.648 --> 01:36:54.048
"but the tent is rigged aright

01:36:54.150 --> 01:36:56.675
"You may rest your bones till morning

01:36:56.786 --> 01:36:58.720
"then if you chance to wake

01:36:58.788 --> 01:37:02.554
"Give me a call about the time
that daylight starts to break"

01:37:14.170 --> 01:37:15.797
- Peter!
- See you in hell, mate.

01:37:15.872 --> 01:37:18.306
- Goodbye, George.
- Why did they do it to us, Harry?

01:37:18.374 --> 01:37:20.638
They have to apologize
for their damn war, George.

01:37:20.710 --> 01:37:23.736
They're trying to end it now,
so they need scapegoats!

01:37:25.715 --> 01:37:28.479
Scapegoats to the bloody Empire!

01:37:53.309 --> 01:37:56.210
Cheer up.
Look as though you're going to a funeral.

01:37:56.279 --> 01:37:58.577
- Harry...
- It's all right, Major.

01:38:01.050 --> 01:38:02.813
I've had a good run.

01:38:03.686 --> 01:38:06.587
There's nothing for me in England anymore.

01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:08.958
And back in Australia...

01:38:10.026 --> 01:38:11.755
they do say that...

01:38:12.962 --> 01:38:17.023
if you need a couple of stiff brandies
before you climb up on...

01:38:17.767 --> 01:38:19.234
a wild horse...

01:38:19.602 --> 01:38:21.160
you're finished.

01:38:24.107 --> 01:38:27.235
Would you make sure
they're posted for me, please?

01:38:27.310 --> 01:38:29.710
And see that this gets published.

01:38:32.115 --> 01:38:34.845
We poets do crave immortality, you know.

01:38:39.589 --> 01:38:40.920
Thank you.

01:38:46.496 --> 01:38:48.088
You want the padre?

01:38:48.164 --> 01:38:50.132
No, thank you. I'm a pagan.

01:38:50.199 --> 01:38:52.599
- And you?
- What's a pagan?

01:38:54.103 --> 01:38:56.936
It's somebody who doesn't believe
there's a divine being...

01:38:57.006 --> 01:38:59.236
dispensing justice to mankind.

01:38:59.609 --> 01:39:01.167
I'm a pagan, too.

01:39:02.178 --> 01:39:04.373
There is an epitaph I'd like.

01:39:04.447 --> 01:39:06.506
Matthew 10:36.

01:39:07.450 --> 01:39:08.849
All right, gentlemen.

01:39:08.918 --> 01:39:11.853
Peter, this is what comes
of empire building.

01:39:21.264 --> 01:39:22.754
Matthew 10:36?

01:39:24.434 --> 01:39:27.870
"And a man's foes shall be
they of his own household."

01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:51.977
<i>"It really ain't the place nor time
To reel off rhyming diction</i>

01:40:52.922 --> 01:40:56.756
<i>"But yet we'll write a final rhyme
While waiting crucifixion!</i>

01:40:57.827 --> 01:41:01.820
<i>"For we bequeath a parting tip
Of sound advice for such men</i>

01:41:01.931 --> 01:41:05.765
<i>"Who come across in transport ships
To polish off the Dutchmen!</i>

01:41:08.471 --> 01:41:12.032
<i>"If you encounter any Boers
You really must not loot 'em</i>

01:41:12.575 --> 01:41:16.841
<i>"And if you wish to leave these shores
For pity's sake don't shoot 'em!</i>

01:41:22.151 --> 01:41:26.019
<i>"Let's toss a bumper down our throat
Before we pass to Heaven</i>

01:41:26.889 --> 01:41:30.052
<i>"And toast: 'the trim-set petticoat</i>

01:41:30.693 --> 01:41:33.321
<i>"'We leave behind in Devon"'</i>

01:41:46.943 --> 01:41:48.001
Aim!

01:41:48.311 --> 01:41:51.610
Shoot straight, you bastards!
Don't make a mess of it!

01:41:51.681 --> 01:41:52.773
Fire!

01:42:13.436 --> 01:42:15.097
Order...
