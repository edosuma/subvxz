WEBVTT

00:16.883 --> 00:17.951
We can start now.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.490
It's all quiet.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.295
Is Dinorah asleep?

00:30.030 --> 00:31.464
Her room's next to mine.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.566
I saw when she turned
the lights off.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.603
We need to be careful
of that woman.

00:37.437 --> 00:38.905
After her sister died,

00:39.372 --> 00:40.774
she became very mistrustful.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.677
We can start, then.

00:45.945 --> 00:48.748
Are you all sure
you want to do this?

00:49.282 --> 00:51.051
I understand if...

00:51.117 --> 00:52.252
We want to do it, Alzira.

00:53.086 --> 00:54.921
If you want to do it.

00:56.790 --> 01:00.427
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

01:48.575 --> 01:49.709
EPISODE:
ALZIRA

01:57.784 --> 01:58.751
Good morning.

02:00.153 --> 02:02.789
I'm sorry. I think I've got
the wrong address.

02:02.856 --> 02:03.823
What are you looking for?

02:04.891 --> 02:06.126
An agency?

02:06.192 --> 02:07.527
I don't know how to explain it.

02:07.594 --> 02:09.095
-"Ausentes"?
-Yes.

02:09.162 --> 02:10.430
It's here.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.665
I know, it doesn't look like it.
Come with me.

02:15.001 --> 02:15.969
-Excuse me.
-This way.

02:20.206 --> 02:21.174
Come in.

02:22.709 --> 02:24.077
My retirement home

02:24.144 --> 02:27.780
was one of the most prestigious
nursing homes in the country.

02:27.847 --> 02:30.116
It's been more than 40 years
since we started.

02:30.183 --> 02:32.452
Yes, we lack resources,

02:32.519 --> 02:36.756
but we look after and focus on
each of our residents.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.292
Are you here to ask for our help

02:39.359 --> 02:42.028
or to promote your business?

02:42.529 --> 02:45.098
I'm sorry. I'm very nervous.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.101
And it's very important
that you understand

02:48.168 --> 02:49.903
something like this
has never happened before.

02:49.969 --> 02:52.005
What happened?

02:52.071 --> 02:54.207
One of our residents...

02:55.341 --> 02:56.509
went missing yesterday.

02:58.611 --> 03:01.247
-Have you told the police?
-No, I can't do that.

03:01.314 --> 03:02.782
Her family doesn't know either.

03:03.249 --> 03:06.119
They have the right to know
if anything happened.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.521
We still don't know
if something happened.

03:09.122 --> 03:13.226
If you find her,
it's like nothing ever happened.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.763
I know I should tell them,

03:17.397 --> 03:18.765
but only if necessary.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.968
Of course, it's not good
to have a retirement home

03:22.035 --> 03:23.670
where residents go missing.

03:23.736 --> 03:25.805
I'm worried about her!

03:25.872 --> 03:27.507
That's why I'm here,
to hire you.

03:27.574 --> 03:29.042
And I'm willing to pay.

03:30.476 --> 03:32.712
I'm not going to promise
anything.

03:33.346 --> 03:36.549
But if she doesn't show up soon,

03:36.616 --> 03:38.084
I'm going to tell them
myself, okay?

03:38.518 --> 03:40.553
Let's start. Name and age.

03:43.456 --> 03:47.260
Alzira, 76 years old.
Healthy. Lucid.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.729
She became widowed at 50
and never remarried.

03:50.129 --> 03:52.332
She entered the retirement home
five years ago.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.001
According to Iolanda,
she gets along with everyone.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.869
This place is dilapidated.

03:56.936 --> 03:59.172
Dilapidated? More than that.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.808
I tried accessing their website,
but there's nothing there.

04:01.874 --> 04:04.911
Just old photos from a place
that no longer exists.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.246
Why did she end up there?

04:06.312 --> 04:07.780
She doesn't seem to have
money problems.

04:08.114 --> 04:10.617
She looks elegant on the photos.

04:10.683 --> 04:12.518
Appearances can be deceiving,
you know?

04:12.585 --> 04:15.722
They are a traditional family
form São Paulo.

04:15.788 --> 04:19.058
Her husband was a business man.
When he died,

04:19.125 --> 04:20.360
it seems the money vanished.

04:20.426 --> 04:23.663
We need to find out
if that money exists or not.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.465
Her relatives
are the main suspects.

04:25.531 --> 04:27.600
It may have to do
with the inheritance.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.235
What kind of relationship
does she have with her family?

04:29.302 --> 04:32.171
I think there's no relationship.
Nobody visited her.

04:32.238 --> 04:34.040
See? Always the same.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.742
It's weird, don't you think?

04:35.808 --> 04:37.844
It's weird to see families
getting along these days.

04:37.910 --> 04:40.280
Only the rich send old relatives
to retirement homes.

04:40.346 --> 04:42.348
The poor don't get rid
of family.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.717
I'd like some coffee, Edith.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.519
If I could, I'd switch my house

04:46.586 --> 04:48.087
for a place
where I'm well cared for.

04:48.154 --> 04:50.790
When I'm no longer able
to drink and care for myself,

04:50.857 --> 04:51.924
I'm going to kill myself.

04:51.991 --> 04:54.494
And you've started
with the process already, Raul?

04:54.560 --> 04:55.828
Have you taken
your medicines yet?

04:56.195 --> 04:58.331
You eat your candies,
but won't take your medicines.

04:58.398 --> 05:01.701
Sometimes the best way
to deal with our loved ones

05:01.768 --> 05:02.869
is keeping them away.

05:02.935 --> 05:04.637
I couldn't be away
from my father.

05:05.405 --> 05:06.773
No matter what.

05:09.442 --> 05:11.244
Okay, let's cut the small talk.

05:12.111 --> 05:13.179
Tai?

05:13.246 --> 05:15.014
Police, hospitals, morgue.

05:15.081 --> 05:17.517
Waldir, look into the facility
and surrounding areas.

05:17.583 --> 05:18.685
Maria Júlia, come with me.

05:24.924 --> 05:26.893
I've noticed you're really close
with your father.

05:27.527 --> 05:28.528
It's my father.

05:29.896 --> 05:30.863
It's normal.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.768
Is there anything
you want to know about me?

05:36.302 --> 05:37.603
I thought that was a good start.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.043
It was not.

05:54.754 --> 05:56.356
Hello? Yes.

05:56.422 --> 05:57.390
It's Maria Júlia.

05:58.958 --> 05:59.959
Rent it out? How?

06:02.061 --> 06:03.029
Two days?

06:04.497 --> 06:06.532
No. Never.

06:08.468 --> 06:09.769
Yes, I'll go. Thank you.

06:16.576 --> 06:17.543
It's private.

06:19.512 --> 06:20.480
Okay.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.850
You want to talk
to all the residents?

06:23.916 --> 06:26.552
Yes, and all the employees

06:26.619 --> 06:28.821
who have been
in contact with Alzira.

06:29.288 --> 06:30.256
Okay.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.428
I'll bring them all here.
Just give me a moment.

06:35.495 --> 06:36.462
Thank you.

06:39.031 --> 06:39.999
Okay.

06:41.033 --> 06:42.168
I get her.

06:45.104 --> 06:47.306
This place used to be great.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.577
We need to find out if Alzira
is well cared for here.

06:58.151 --> 07:01.187
I don't know exactly
what happened.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.056
One day she was here,
and the next day...

07:07.059 --> 07:08.127
she was gone!

07:08.194 --> 07:11.130
Alzira is missing?
I haven't noticed.

07:12.732 --> 07:15.401
My memory, you know?
It fails me.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.437
We all love Alzira here.

07:18.571 --> 07:22.141
If she ran away or disappeared,
it was her decision.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.176
Just hers.

07:26.412 --> 07:28.080
Sir, are you okay?

07:28.147 --> 07:31.317
Excuse me, he won't be able
to continue.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.486
Come with me.
I'll get you some water.

07:35.755 --> 07:36.722
Excuse us.

07:40.927 --> 07:42.361
Can I trust you?

07:43.629 --> 07:46.065
Something sinister
is going on here.

07:47.233 --> 07:48.201
What is going on?

07:48.835 --> 07:50.169
I wouldn't know.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.039
Miriam, my sister,
was very good at this.

07:53.506 --> 07:55.975
She always knew
what was going on here.

07:56.509 --> 07:57.643
Where is she now?

07:58.478 --> 07:59.445
She died.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.482
She was taken too soon.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.150
Do you understand?

08:11.157 --> 08:13.125
I'm afraid I didn't understand.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.928
It's nothing.
I've said too much already.

08:17.463 --> 08:18.865
They weren't very helpful.

08:20.733 --> 08:22.635
But the weird lady
wanted to help.

08:23.402 --> 08:24.470
Right?

08:24.537 --> 08:26.005
I'll talk to her later.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.609
So, we have the main entrance

08:29.675 --> 08:31.410
and this service door.

08:31.944 --> 08:33.546
She had to leave
through one of them.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.649
Other than that,
it's all high walls

08:36.716 --> 08:38.117
and thick vegetation.

08:39.852 --> 08:40.887
Talk to Iolanda.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.589
Ask her to show you
the security cameras.

08:43.656 --> 08:44.624
Okay.

08:45.057 --> 08:46.025
What about you?

08:46.859 --> 08:47.927
I'll trust my intuition.

08:53.132 --> 08:54.100
Hello, Tai.

08:55.134 --> 08:58.504
Has Iolanda sent you
the employees files yet?

08:59.438 --> 09:00.506
Okay.

09:00.573 --> 09:01.707
Good.

09:01.774 --> 09:05.011
Check the records
of one of them in particular.

09:05.745 --> 09:07.914
Jorge Augusto Dos Santos.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.249
He's a nurse.

09:13.519 --> 09:14.487
Look at this.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.522
He's an ex-con.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.593
Larceny, assault.
Resisting arrest at 19.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.495
He spend five years in jail.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.831
He was set free early
for good behavior.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.334
I thought it was something
more serious.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.435
Like kidnapping.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.305
We'll see. Thanks.

09:34.640 --> 09:35.708
There you go.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.378
Hello.

09:40.813 --> 09:41.781
How are you?

09:43.616 --> 09:44.584
Can we talk?

09:46.018 --> 09:47.086
I don't know anything.

09:47.153 --> 09:48.487
I wasn't even working
that night.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.123
Yes, I saw you didn't clock in.

09:54.393 --> 09:55.361
That's right.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.597
But I wasn't close with her.

09:57.663 --> 10:01.400
Relax. You answer
before I even make a question.

10:01.467 --> 10:03.736
I have a lot of work to do.
Excuse me.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.078
Here. Come!

10:17.617 --> 10:19.085
Dinorah, right?

10:19.151 --> 10:20.486
You remembered!

10:21.721 --> 10:23.990
I need to tell you something
that's very important.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.024
Tell me.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.793
I saw you talking to Jorge.

10:27.860 --> 10:31.430
Be careful of him.
He's an ex-con, did you know?

10:32.264 --> 10:34.100
My sister, God bless her,

10:34.166 --> 10:35.534
never trusted him.

10:35.601 --> 10:37.603
-Why?
-I don't know.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.438
I've been always really naive.

10:40.239 --> 10:42.408
But she knew
when someone was evil.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.612
I feel so defenseless
now that she's gone.

10:46.679 --> 10:49.448
Dinorah, do you have
anything to tell me

10:49.515 --> 10:50.950
that can help me in this case?

10:51.450 --> 10:54.120
Mysterious things happen here.

10:55.121 --> 10:56.255
My sister know about them.

10:58.124 --> 10:59.992
Maybe that's why she's dead?

11:00.459 --> 11:02.528
My Lord! I don't want
to be next.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.266
Do you know
what happened to Alzira?

11:08.701 --> 11:10.336
Such a deceptive woman.
I don't know.

11:10.403 --> 11:11.704
She never told me anything.

11:11.771 --> 11:13.639
They must have taken her
by mistake.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.275
They were going to take me,
I'm sure.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.646
Raul, I need a strong man
to protect me, please.

11:20.713 --> 11:24.116
If you have nothing to tell me,
I can't help you, Dinorah.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.319
I need you take me out of here.
I need to leave this place.

11:27.386 --> 11:28.888
I have to go.

11:28.954 --> 11:30.456
-Excuse me.
-Raul!

11:35.961 --> 11:37.663
Are you sure it's all gone?

11:38.864 --> 11:40.299
Don't you make backups?

11:40.366 --> 11:43.302
I'm sorry. The backup system
hasn't been working properly,

11:43.369 --> 11:45.538
and we don't have enough money
to fix it.

11:45.604 --> 11:47.606
We don't have any footage
from the last two days.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.175
It should be priority.

11:49.975 --> 11:51.310
For residents' safety.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.845
When everything is a priority,

11:53.145 --> 11:54.914
getting food and medicines,

11:54.980 --> 11:56.949
paying the employees,
and there are a lot of them,

11:57.616 --> 11:59.285
is very hard to adjust
the expenses.

12:03.089 --> 12:06.625
Don't you think it's strange
the system failed

12:06.692 --> 12:08.894
on the same day
Alzira disappeared?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.097
Are you suggesting
it was intentional?

12:11.163 --> 12:12.131
I don't know.

12:13.099 --> 12:14.500
I'd like to be sure about it,

12:14.567 --> 12:16.469
but you told me it always fails.

12:16.535 --> 12:18.671
Not always, but pretty often.

12:20.272 --> 12:22.341
I'm sorry
I can't be of any more help.

12:29.448 --> 12:31.450
Have you seen anything
on the footage?

12:32.451 --> 12:33.819
The system is old.

12:33.886 --> 12:36.255
When collapsed,
it stops recording

12:36.322 --> 12:38.624
instead of erasing
the latest images.

12:39.225 --> 12:40.192
That's good.

12:40.526 --> 12:41.727
Is it?

12:41.794 --> 12:43.429
We don't have any image
of anybody!

12:43.496 --> 12:46.665
I know, but it means
that Alzira's kidnapper

12:46.732 --> 12:47.800
knew about this too.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.669
I haven't thought about that.

12:53.005 --> 12:56.742
Iolanda, did you know
Jorge is an ex-con?

12:56.809 --> 12:59.779
Of course,
he and half of the employees

12:59.845 --> 13:01.547
have criminal records.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.984
It's part of a social
reintegration support program.

13:05.050 --> 13:07.820
-That's great.
-Not so great.

13:07.887 --> 13:10.956
That's the only way for us
to have so many employees.

13:11.023 --> 13:13.058
Their salary is on the program.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.093
I see.

13:14.994 --> 13:16.962
Would you stick your neck out
for them?

13:17.763 --> 13:19.165
They've never caused
any trouble.

13:20.132 --> 13:21.100
So far.

13:22.334 --> 13:23.269
Okay, shall we?

13:24.470 --> 13:25.871
-Bye.
-Thanks.

13:25.938 --> 13:26.906
You're welcome.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.683
I made a sweep
around the retirement home.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.386
I asked people at the bar,
the bakery, the newsstand

13:40.452 --> 13:41.821
and the church.

13:42.354 --> 13:43.722
Nobody saw Alzira.

13:43.789 --> 13:46.325
Well, if she left,
she didn't walk by those places.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.762
Maybe there was a car
waiting for her in the street.

13:50.262 --> 13:51.597
Very conveniently,

13:51.664 --> 13:54.700
security cameras
weren't working at that time.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.604
Tai, is there
any traffic camera nearby?

13:58.671 --> 14:00.039
There is none there, Raul.

14:00.105 --> 14:01.674
It's a very remote neighborhood.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.275
It's almost a rural area.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.077
I talked to the other residents,

14:05.144 --> 14:08.080
who told me Alzira
was very much loved.

14:08.147 --> 14:10.015
She never had problems
with anyone.

14:10.082 --> 14:11.884
Dinorah is the only one who said

14:11.951 --> 14:14.687
strange things happen there.

14:14.753 --> 14:16.722
I don't know
if she actually knows something

14:16.789 --> 14:17.857
and doesn't want to tell us

14:18.490 --> 14:20.826
-or if she's just delusional.
-I don't know either.

14:20.893 --> 14:22.328
Why do you say so?

14:22.394 --> 14:24.897
She suggested
her sister was killed

14:24.964 --> 14:26.265
in order to keep a secret.

14:26.832 --> 14:27.900
That might be the case.

14:28.467 --> 14:30.903
-Some kind of creepy ritual.
-What are you saying, Waldir?

14:30.970 --> 14:32.271
We need to consider
all possibilities.

14:32.338 --> 14:35.541
Let's talk
about conspiracy theories later,

14:35.608 --> 14:38.143
when we have ruled out
other possibilities.

14:39.912 --> 14:43.349
The employees
are mostly ex-cons.

14:43.415 --> 14:46.619
Yes, but you focused
on one in particular, Jorge.

14:46.685 --> 14:47.653
Right.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.823
He acted weird
when I talked to him.

14:51.690 --> 14:53.359
I think you're just judgmental.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.863
If you knew me better,
you wouldn't say that.

14:57.930 --> 15:01.166
Raul has a lot of flaw,
but that's not one of them.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.301
That's true.

15:02.368 --> 15:04.303
The next step
is to find a motive.

15:05.004 --> 15:08.607
That will help us narrow down
the list of suspects.

15:08.674 --> 15:09.742
Okay.

15:09.808 --> 15:10.976
Her retirement home,

15:11.443 --> 15:13.946
one of the employees,
some old fellow,

15:14.013 --> 15:14.980
her family.

15:15.714 --> 15:17.283
We've already been
to the retirement home.

15:18.317 --> 15:20.819
I think it's time to talk
to her family.

15:20.886 --> 15:21.921
Let me do that.

15:21.987 --> 15:24.223
I'll try to figure out
who manages the finances,

15:24.290 --> 15:26.325
why they put her
in the retirement home

15:26.392 --> 15:27.960
and why nobody visits her.

15:28.027 --> 15:29.628
Do you want me to join you?

15:30.229 --> 15:31.463
I could help you count.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.332
-With your fineness?
-Yes.

15:33.399 --> 15:34.366
No, thanks.

15:42.708 --> 15:43.642
This way.

15:45.377 --> 15:46.912
Pretty house.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.747
Thank you.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.151
So, you wanted to talk to me
about my mother?

15:52.217 --> 15:53.552
Exactly.

15:54.053 --> 15:55.854
She's not feeling well,
actually.

15:55.921 --> 15:57.990
She won't join us for tea.

15:58.691 --> 15:59.658
That way.

16:00.726 --> 16:01.760
Okay.

16:03.062 --> 16:04.263
She's here, then?

16:05.431 --> 16:08.233
-Thank you.
-Where else would she be?

16:08.934 --> 16:11.537
Well, Mrs. Alzira disappeared
from Santa Joana,

16:11.603 --> 16:13.505
but we never imagined
she would be...

16:13.572 --> 16:14.540
What?

16:15.007 --> 16:16.308
My mom is not
at the retirement home?

16:16.375 --> 16:18.444
-She's not here, then?
-Of course not!

16:18.510 --> 16:21.280
I spend a fortune
for them to look after her,

16:21.347 --> 16:22.448
and now she's disappeared?

16:23.248 --> 16:24.383
Nobody told me anything!

16:25.184 --> 16:26.819
I'll sue them.

16:26.885 --> 16:30.289
That's why they hired us,
to find her!

16:30.356 --> 16:33.325
And I won't pay a penny
to you for that!

16:33.392 --> 16:35.828
-Of course not.
-I hate being blackmailed!

16:37.196 --> 16:38.530
Carlinhos, son, please.

16:38.964 --> 16:40.332
Walk her to the door.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.235
My lawyer will contact you.

16:47.539 --> 16:48.807
What's just happened?

16:49.375 --> 16:51.610
I'm sorry.
She sometimes acts like that.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.581
I can explain, but not here.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.953
So, your mother

17:01.020 --> 17:03.322
lies about your grandmother
being at a retirement home.

17:03.655 --> 17:05.457
Yes, it's embarrassing for her.

17:05.991 --> 17:07.059
She keeps telling everyone

17:07.126 --> 17:08.460
she suffers a lot
looking after her.

17:08.527 --> 17:09.995
She loves to play victim.

17:11.497 --> 17:12.464
That's bad!

17:14.433 --> 17:17.436
My mom's problem
is that she is stuck in past.

17:18.570 --> 17:20.706
She thinks
she's still important,

17:20.773 --> 17:22.508
her surname is powerful,

17:22.574 --> 17:23.542
she has money.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.881
She has to have money.

17:29.648 --> 17:30.916
Look at this house!

17:31.617 --> 17:33.585
This house is all we have.

17:33.652 --> 17:34.720
It has a mortgage.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.655
We would have sold it long ago

17:36.722 --> 17:37.890
if we had had a buyer.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.560
She mentioned a lawyer.

17:42.161 --> 17:44.329
If she can afford to have one...

17:44.396 --> 17:45.931
She doesn't have a penny
to her name.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.300
My mom never got along
with my grandma.

17:48.367 --> 17:49.435
She doesn't care about her.

17:49.868 --> 17:51.503
My grandma's money is all gone.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.073
Except for the amount she hid.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.474
What do you mean?

17:55.841 --> 17:58.243
My mom says that my grandma

17:58.310 --> 18:01.113
owns shares, jewelry and so,

18:02.147 --> 18:03.382
but doesn't want
to give it to us.

18:04.149 --> 18:06.652
That's why you put her
in the retirement home?

18:08.887 --> 18:10.022
We didn't do it.

18:10.389 --> 18:11.590
She did it.

18:12.191 --> 18:13.959
She decided to live
in that worn down place.

18:15.127 --> 18:18.497
Mi mom claims she did it
to pretend she has no money.

18:18.564 --> 18:20.532
So, you don't worry
about your grandma?

18:21.700 --> 18:23.068
She lived her life.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.504
I'm trying to live mine.

18:26.538 --> 18:27.506
Like now.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.942
I'd like to get
to know you better.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.315
Don't go, give a chance!

18:36.381 --> 18:38.417
Don't play dumb!

18:39.251 --> 18:40.219
I'm serious!

18:45.591 --> 18:46.558
Hi, Tai?

18:47.893 --> 18:49.595
Are you busy?

18:55.467 --> 18:58.237
-Thanks for coming with me.
-You're welcome.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.572
After spending a day
talking about a retirement home,

19:00.639 --> 19:03.175
it's difficult for me
to get home and see my grandma,

19:03.242 --> 19:04.843
and not want to put her in one.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.113
Aren't you being too hard
on her?

19:08.881 --> 19:10.149
You don't know her.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.117
It can't be

19:12.818 --> 19:15.020
as bad as
what my father left me.

19:16.855 --> 19:18.423
I'm an expert in tidying up.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.460
When Eva plays,
the house is a mess.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.029
It's so strange to think of you
as a mother.

19:24.796 --> 19:27.032
-Are you being judgmental?
-No.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.902
I mean, you are so young.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.237
But life made me mature quickly.

19:33.238 --> 19:34.206
There's nothing in here.

19:37.242 --> 19:40.112
If Raul was here,
what do you think he would do?

19:41.980 --> 19:44.917
I'd spend hours
looking for a useful clue.

19:45.651 --> 19:48.620
And then he'd suddenly have
a brilliant idea.

19:48.687 --> 19:52.391
The owner told me
to hand in the keys in two days.

19:53.559 --> 19:54.826
We'd better hurry up, then.

19:58.030 --> 19:58.997
Yes.

20:38.003 --> 20:39.104
Boss?

20:39.171 --> 20:40.239
KIDNAPPING

20:40.305 --> 20:41.440
Can I talk to you?

20:41.506 --> 20:42.841
I'm busy, Dama.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.710
That's exactly what I want
to talk to you about.

20:45.444 --> 20:47.012
Everyone's talking.

20:49.181 --> 20:50.249
Talking?

20:50.315 --> 20:51.783
You are not assigning tasks.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.552
They don't know what to do.
They feel lost.

20:53.619 --> 20:54.853
Aren't you doing that for me?

20:54.920 --> 20:58.090
Yes, but it's not the same.
You are the boss, not me.

20:58.156 --> 20:59.324
Do you want to take my place?

20:59.891 --> 21:00.926
I'd like that.

21:01.526 --> 21:03.328
It's not that. It's not.

21:04.196 --> 21:05.564
I have your back,
and you know it.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.499
Leave me alone, then!

21:41.066 --> 21:43.268
I think it's time for you
to tell me

21:43.869 --> 21:45.771
who and what we're looking for.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.007
I was trying to protect you.

21:50.208 --> 21:52.077
But I think
you're involved already.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.847
-My father.
-Oscar is your father?

21:58.283 --> 22:01.119
Well, I imagined it, but...

22:01.553 --> 22:03.588
It seems he got in trouble.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.758
I don't know,
there has to be something.

22:07.225 --> 22:10.162
My father left me a saint statue

22:10.228 --> 22:11.697
with a pen drive inside.

22:11.763 --> 22:12.998
The postcard.

22:13.799 --> 22:14.766
He left clues.

22:16.568 --> 22:19.004
I believe I'm going to find
a fake wall,

22:19.071 --> 22:22.774
a hidden drawer, a secret bag.

22:24.609 --> 22:26.778
You've got used to being
an investigator.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.015
That's all I can think about.

22:31.683 --> 22:32.818
It's not your fault.

22:33.919 --> 22:34.986
Maybe he didn't leave anything

22:35.053 --> 22:37.389
because he knew
that the people looking for him

22:37.923 --> 22:39.791
could come here
and find something.

22:41.226 --> 22:42.194
That's it, Tai!

22:43.562 --> 22:45.230
-You're a genius!
-Am I?

22:45.297 --> 22:46.998
I mean, I know I am, but...

22:48.100 --> 22:50.535
-Why do you say that?
-If we thought

22:50.602 --> 22:53.238
we would find a clue here,

22:53.305 --> 22:55.273
others could have
thought it too!

22:55.340 --> 22:56.308
And?

22:56.742 --> 22:59.311
I'll give money to the doorman,

22:59.378 --> 23:01.913
ask him to let me know
if someone comes.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.382
Good idea!

23:03.448 --> 23:04.916
Great idea!

23:11.656 --> 23:14.593
You look like a rich man
driving that car.

23:14.993 --> 23:17.763
Me, rich? You're kidding, right?

23:18.764 --> 23:20.899
I just park rich people's cars.

23:20.966 --> 23:23.802
They come and leave their car,
and when there's a spot,

23:23.869 --> 23:24.936
I park it for them.

23:25.003 --> 23:27.439
That's honest work.

23:28.707 --> 23:30.542
You know
I'm rehabilitated, Raul.

23:31.176 --> 23:32.210
That's why I'm here.

23:33.011 --> 23:35.447
We've known each other
for a long time, Raul.

23:36.148 --> 23:39.017
You haven't come here
for me to park your car.

23:39.518 --> 23:40.585
You're right.

23:40.652 --> 23:41.586
What's going on?

23:42.754 --> 23:45.457
I want to talk about your time
at Franco da Rocha.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.360
I spent ten years there!

23:48.427 --> 23:49.494
Ten years!

23:50.695 --> 23:54.132
I need you to remember a guy
who was there at the same time.

23:54.633 --> 23:57.035
His name
is Jorge Augusto Santos.

23:58.236 --> 24:00.539
¿Jorge Augusto Sa...?

24:00.605 --> 24:01.640
Jorjão!

24:02.307 --> 24:05.877
Jorjão. I met him.
He was a good guy, great guy.

24:05.944 --> 24:07.012
Great guy.

24:07.412 --> 24:10.282
He was locked up
over something really silly.

24:10.348 --> 24:13.585
It was a mistake.
But he learnt his lesson.

24:13.652 --> 24:14.619
Listen,

24:15.086 --> 24:16.521
I don't know
what he's up to now,

24:17.322 --> 24:18.390
but I can assure you

24:19.124 --> 24:20.358
he's a good man.

24:21.059 --> 24:22.027
He is?

24:22.627 --> 24:24.529
He's a good man until he's not.

24:25.730 --> 24:26.865
You need to trust, Raul.

24:26.932 --> 24:27.899
Yes.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.335
It's a matter of trust.

24:39.010 --> 24:40.078
-Listen.
-What?

24:40.145 --> 24:41.112
You know?

24:43.448 --> 24:44.783
Something weird happened.

24:45.450 --> 24:47.319
Some agents came

24:47.385 --> 24:49.754
and asked everyone questions.

24:49.821 --> 24:50.789
Questions about what?

24:54.726 --> 24:56.495
About kidnapped kids.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.196
Kidnapped kids.

24:58.263 --> 25:01.299
Big raid.
Full of police officers.

25:01.366 --> 25:02.434
Everyone was worried.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.437
And the chief

25:06.137 --> 25:07.973
-looked like your partner.
-Damasceno?

25:08.039 --> 25:10.475
That guy, Damasceno!

25:11.376 --> 25:12.344
Damasceno.

25:15.447 --> 25:16.414
Be quick.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.151
Thanks.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.755
-Who is it?
-Olavo.

25:23.822 --> 25:26.024
-The old sick man.
-Damn it!

25:26.491 --> 25:27.559
-And...?
-Jorge?

25:27.626 --> 25:28.827
-Yes.
-I checked.

25:28.894 --> 25:30.028
He was busy all night

25:30.095 --> 25:32.397
looking after a female resident
who was not feeling well.

25:32.464 --> 25:33.431
Okay.

25:34.099 --> 25:35.166
Damn.

25:35.233 --> 25:38.503
We need a list of the employees
who weren't working.

25:39.571 --> 25:40.705
Where is Iolanda?

25:40.772 --> 25:43.808
With Olavo's son.
He seems pretty upset.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.577
I thought she didn't want
anyone to know.

25:45.644 --> 25:49.080
She didn't tell him.
He visits his father every day.

25:49.147 --> 25:50.649
He's really nervous.

25:51.116 --> 25:52.150
I'll go see them.

25:52.851 --> 25:53.919
Listen,

25:53.985 --> 25:56.154
talk to Olavo's friend.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.123
They seemed really close.

25:58.189 --> 25:59.958
-Sebastião.
-Yes. Find him, please.

26:00.025 --> 26:01.059
Okay.

26:02.427 --> 26:03.495
Damn it!

26:03.562 --> 26:04.896
If my father doesn't show up,

26:05.397 --> 26:08.199
I promise I will get this place
shut down!

26:09.000 --> 26:09.935
Excuse me.

26:10.769 --> 26:11.736
What do you want?

26:12.470 --> 26:13.939
He's an investigator.

26:14.005 --> 26:17.175
-We hired to find out...
-So you had enough time

26:17.242 --> 26:18.643
to hire an investigator?

26:18.710 --> 26:19.945
Let me explain.

26:20.011 --> 26:23.481
A female resident disappeared
the day before yesterday.

26:23.548 --> 26:25.116
What? Another one?

26:25.183 --> 26:26.818
-Is this an epidemic?
-It's not. Calm down.

26:26.885 --> 26:28.820
-We're doing our best...
-You are?

26:28.887 --> 26:30.755
Calm down! This is not the way!

26:30.822 --> 26:32.824
You won't solve anything
like this!

26:32.891 --> 26:35.327
-Not like this! Calm down!
-How did she disappear?

26:35.393 --> 26:36.361
I get you.

26:37.629 --> 26:41.132
Let's breathe.
Drink some water, coffee or tea.

26:42.367 --> 26:44.035
-Now we talk.
-I'm sorry.

26:45.170 --> 26:46.838
I don't know anything.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.741
You seemed pretty close.

26:51.509 --> 26:53.478
I thought you'd be worried.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.280
He's like a brother to me.

26:56.114 --> 26:59.250
Why don't you help me
then, Sebastião?

26:59.951 --> 27:00.986
How?

27:02.287 --> 27:03.254
Nothing can be done.

27:04.089 --> 27:07.359
Your friend disappeared
after Alzira disappeared too.

27:08.393 --> 27:09.661
Don't you consider
it is strange?

27:11.329 --> 27:12.297
It's a coincidence.

27:13.365 --> 27:14.966
You don't really
think that, right?

27:16.601 --> 27:19.304
People gone missing like that
is not normal.

27:19.838 --> 27:21.773
What do you think is normal?

27:22.941 --> 27:25.377
Do you think dying is normal?

27:26.678 --> 27:29.681
Do you think we don't get
to choose how to live

27:29.748 --> 27:31.016
and how to die?

27:33.451 --> 27:34.786
What do you mean by that?

27:38.123 --> 27:39.090
Mr. Sebastião!

27:44.329 --> 27:45.897
-Here.
-Thanks.

27:50.935 --> 27:53.338
I'm sorry.
I'm not a violent man.

27:54.472 --> 27:55.940
My father is very sick.

27:57.442 --> 27:59.611
He doesn't have much time left.

28:02.414 --> 28:05.383
Can I ask
why you put him in here?

28:06.351 --> 28:07.986
We didn't want him here.

28:09.220 --> 28:11.222
But he insisted.

28:12.123 --> 28:15.293
He said he was a burden
in our lives.

28:16.795 --> 28:18.830
How can a parent be a burden?

28:19.831 --> 28:20.799
I see.

28:21.966 --> 28:23.802
Okay, do you know

28:24.502 --> 28:27.072
if someone
has a problem with him?

28:28.006 --> 28:29.207
No, of course not.

28:30.442 --> 28:31.443
He is an old sick man.

28:32.110 --> 28:33.445
He's never hurt anybody.

28:34.079 --> 28:35.380
Never. Nobody.

28:37.182 --> 28:38.249
What about money?

28:38.316 --> 28:39.284
What money?

28:39.851 --> 28:40.852
Does he have money?

28:41.686 --> 28:45.423
Would someone kidnap him
to get ransom money?

28:45.490 --> 28:46.458
If...

28:46.891 --> 28:49.928
If we had money,
do you think he'd be here?

28:51.963 --> 28:53.098
Do you think I have money?

28:54.699 --> 28:55.667
Okay.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.937
Have you ever

29:00.038 --> 29:01.873
distrusted this place?

29:03.842 --> 29:04.976
What do you mean?

29:05.043 --> 29:06.511
-I...
-Of course not!

29:06.578 --> 29:09.180
Okay, I'm just ruling out
all the fake clues.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.782
Don't worry. I apologize.

29:12.016 --> 29:13.418
Is he close with Alzira?

29:13.852 --> 29:14.786
No.

29:15.253 --> 29:18.089
They're just friends.
They belong in the same group,

29:18.923 --> 29:19.891
but that's it.

29:21.326 --> 29:25.463
Would you say your father
has been acting weird lately?

29:25.530 --> 29:27.899
Have you noticed
any unusual behavior?

29:29.100 --> 29:31.669
No. He wanted to stop
chemotherapy.

29:33.304 --> 29:35.507
He said he suffered a lot.

29:36.007 --> 29:38.076
But I insisted.

29:38.143 --> 29:41.146
I told him he has a family.
He seemed to understand.

29:44.582 --> 29:45.550
Okay.

29:47.285 --> 29:48.219
Excuse me.

29:49.754 --> 29:50.722
Raul...

29:51.956 --> 29:54.359
I have an urgent matter
to attend to.

29:55.193 --> 29:56.828
Can I help you?

29:56.895 --> 29:59.798
No, it's personal.
This case is too much already.

29:59.864 --> 30:03.134
Do what you need to do.
See you later at the agency.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.837
-Okay, thank you.
-Good luck.

30:05.904 --> 30:06.871
Good luck.

30:19.684 --> 30:20.685
Nothing.

30:21.419 --> 30:22.420
This is nothing but trash.

30:23.221 --> 30:24.756
We're wasting our damn time!

30:24.823 --> 30:27.258
Don't you see
someone has come here already?

30:27.725 --> 30:31.329
You don't tidy up
if you're in a rush.

30:31.396 --> 30:32.363
What does it matter?

30:32.697 --> 30:34.432
If there was something in here,
it's gone now.

30:34.966 --> 30:36.601
The boss asked us to be quick.

30:37.001 --> 30:37.969
Let's go.

31:25.283 --> 31:26.251
It got complicated.

31:27.085 --> 31:29.053
There are two residents missing.

31:30.121 --> 31:31.823
We don't even know
if they are alive!

31:33.691 --> 31:36.227
How can they disappear
and leave no trace?

31:36.961 --> 31:38.296
What do they have in common?

31:39.998 --> 31:40.965
Nothing, apparently.

31:41.332 --> 31:42.400
Nothing.

31:42.467 --> 31:44.936
If Alzira has money,
it's hidden.

31:45.003 --> 31:46.371
Olavo doesn't have any money.

31:47.005 --> 31:49.540
Alzira's family ignores her.

31:49.607 --> 31:51.609
Olavo's family loves him.

31:52.076 --> 31:54.312
Alzira is healthy.
Olavo is sick.

31:55.013 --> 31:57.715
According to my research,
they have nothing in common.

31:58.316 --> 32:00.485
Alzira has always lived
in São Paulo,

32:00.551 --> 32:02.887
and Olavo is from Minas Gerais.
Nothing in common.

32:02.954 --> 32:04.322
Nothing at all.

32:04.389 --> 32:06.658
I followed the trace
you were talking about

32:07.392 --> 32:09.794
to look into the employees
with a criminal record

32:09.861 --> 32:11.696
and see if they
live a double life.

32:11.763 --> 32:15.333
But the company only accepts
those who want to rehabilitate.

32:16.367 --> 32:18.002
It doesn't make any sense.

32:19.037 --> 32:21.839
These are
two separate disappearances.

32:21.906 --> 32:23.107
What do we do now?

32:24.075 --> 32:26.344
I hate to think
Dinorah may be right,

32:26.411 --> 32:28.446
but that's all we have
to work with now.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.983
Someone from the inside
is making them disappear.

32:32.417 --> 32:33.384
But who?

32:33.885 --> 32:36.321
Waldir and Tai, find out more
about the group

32:36.387 --> 32:39.390
that promotes
the reintegration of ex-cons.

32:39.457 --> 32:41.025
I have a bad feeling about it.

32:41.759 --> 32:43.895
Maria Júlia,
go to the retirement home.

32:44.762 --> 32:47.098
Get as much information
from Dinorah as possible.

32:48.232 --> 32:49.801
-Okay?
-Let's go.

32:52.136 --> 32:53.571
I hate doing repeated work.

32:54.706 --> 32:56.274
I've never heard you
say that, Raul.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.576
Old people gone missing.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.012
It sounds
like a bad horror movie.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.183
But a phone call was enough.

33:06.117 --> 33:07.719
Tell me the truth.
What is going on?

33:09.120 --> 33:10.088
Dama, I...

33:11.122 --> 33:12.490
I've heard a rumor...

33:13.658 --> 33:16.194
about an illegal
adoption agency.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.029
If it's a rumor, it's old.

33:18.096 --> 33:19.564
You know the story well.

33:19.630 --> 33:22.166
But I've been told
something new.

33:22.900 --> 33:24.302
And you're involved.

33:24.702 --> 33:27.105
Your informants
will be your ruin.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.139
Is it true or not?

33:29.073 --> 33:31.676
I'm investigating, Raul.
I haven't found anything out.

33:31.743 --> 33:33.311
That's why I didn't tell you.

33:36.514 --> 33:37.815
But if you find something out,

33:38.816 --> 33:40.084
you will let me know.

33:40.151 --> 33:41.953
Are you telling me what to do?

33:45.056 --> 33:46.591
Who is the boss here?

33:49.560 --> 33:51.496
That's my decision, Dama.

33:51.562 --> 33:53.765
I'm sorry, Raul!
You know I have your back.

33:53.831 --> 33:56.601
-They can't close the case!
-The case no longer exists.

33:56.667 --> 33:57.702
If she wasn't your daughter,

33:57.769 --> 33:59.037
you would have closed it
already!

33:59.103 --> 34:00.705
But she is my daughter!

34:00.772 --> 34:04.342
It's an order from above.
You're not being objective!

34:04.409 --> 34:06.577
I won't stop until I find her!

34:06.644 --> 34:09.113
Stop before you do something
you'll regret.

34:09.180 --> 34:11.649
-Something like this?
-You're getting crazy!

34:13.017 --> 34:14.585
She's my daughter!

34:15.953 --> 34:16.921
Calm down!

34:46.384 --> 34:47.452
-Maria Júlia?
-Yes.

34:47.518 --> 34:48.486
You won't believe it.

34:48.986 --> 34:50.855
-They've come back?
-Worse.

34:50.922 --> 34:51.889
Much worse.

34:52.790 --> 34:54.225
Who's gone missing?

34:55.526 --> 34:56.494
Dinorah?

34:59.263 --> 35:00.898
Have you talked
to Damasceno, Raul?

35:00.965 --> 35:02.800
No. Damasceno didn't know
anything.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.235
Or he doesn't want to tell me.

35:04.635 --> 35:06.737
Why do you say that?

35:06.804 --> 35:08.773
Just forget about it.
Have you found something out?

35:10.074 --> 35:11.109
Nothing.

35:11.409 --> 35:13.644
The company is legitimate.
Philanthropic.

35:14.278 --> 35:16.013
It's got international awards.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.749
Hold on a minute.
Maria Júlia is calling me.

35:18.816 --> 35:20.351
-Hi.
-I'm at the retirement home.

35:20.985 --> 35:22.653
Guess who's gone missing.

35:23.688 --> 35:24.755
Jorge?

35:24.822 --> 35:25.790
How do you know?

35:26.657 --> 35:28.793
Forget it. Are you on your way?

35:28.860 --> 35:30.394
No. I had a better idea.

35:31.829 --> 35:33.931
Tai, I need Jorge's address.

35:34.532 --> 35:35.500
Send it to me.

35:41.472 --> 35:42.440
Dinorah?

35:43.074 --> 35:44.041
Dinorah!

35:44.475 --> 35:45.676
I didn't do anything wrong.

35:45.743 --> 35:46.978
I just wanted
what belonged to me.

35:47.378 --> 35:48.346
What do you mean?

35:49.280 --> 35:51.182
-Nothing. Excuse me.
-No! Come here.

35:51.249 --> 35:52.416
I want to talk.

35:53.017 --> 35:54.418
You come from Alzira's room,
don't you?

35:54.485 --> 35:56.220
-Yes.
-What did you take from there?

35:56.287 --> 35:59.323
I didn't take anything.
I just wanted my medallion.

35:59.390 --> 36:00.458
Your medallion?

36:00.525 --> 36:01.926
With the image
of "Nuestra Señora".

36:01.993 --> 36:04.195
Alzira borrowed it from me,
but never gave it back.

36:04.262 --> 36:07.331
Okay, but if you didn't find it,
why were you running away?

36:07.398 --> 36:10.501
There are more things missing,
and they will blame me.

36:10.835 --> 36:11.869
What else is missing?

36:11.936 --> 36:14.505
A blue pashmina
and a beautiful necklace

36:14.572 --> 36:16.407
that Alzira bought
and never wore.

36:16.474 --> 36:18.609
Are you sure those three things
are missing?

36:18.676 --> 36:19.744
Yes!

36:20.178 --> 36:22.079
¿A blue pashmina,
a necklace she never wore

36:22.146 --> 36:23.881
-and your medallion?
-That's right.

36:24.949 --> 36:26.584
-I know what happened.
-What?

36:28.986 --> 36:30.521
You won't believe this!

36:30.588 --> 36:32.323
Four more residents are gone.

36:32.390 --> 36:33.591
They are missing?

36:33.658 --> 36:35.326
No, they left together by taxi.

36:35.393 --> 36:37.762
They must be afraid
of getting kidnapped.

36:37.828 --> 36:39.397
No, relax. They'll come back.

36:39.463 --> 36:40.531
Why are you so sure?

36:40.598 --> 36:43.000
Don't they belong
in Alzira and Olavo's group?

36:43.067 --> 36:45.670
Yes, but Leonor is still here.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.139
Leonor is the lady
that wasn't feeling well?

36:48.206 --> 36:50.975
Yes. Poor Jorge
looked after her all night.

36:54.445 --> 36:55.413
Leonor?

36:56.614 --> 36:58.015
May I talk to you?

36:59.317 --> 37:02.753
Can you come later?
I don't feel well.

37:09.994 --> 37:11.996
You don't feel well

37:12.663 --> 37:13.664
or you feel sad

37:14.432 --> 37:16.300
because you're going to miss
the wedding?

37:24.742 --> 37:26.143
How did you find out?

37:27.578 --> 37:32.049
Mi grandma taught me
a bride needs four things.

37:32.683 --> 37:34.385
Something new, something old,

37:34.452 --> 37:36.454
something blue
and something borrowed.

37:37.288 --> 37:39.257
It all made sense when I saw
Dinorah leaving Alzira's room.

37:39.323 --> 37:40.992
She wants the medallion
she borrowed her.

37:41.459 --> 37:44.395
Alzira liked the irony

37:44.462 --> 37:46.497
of getting nosy Dinorah's help.

37:50.501 --> 37:52.169
They ran away
to get married, right?

37:54.605 --> 37:55.673
They didn't say anything

37:55.740 --> 37:57.575
because they didn't want anyone
to stop them.

37:58.409 --> 37:59.377
Right?

38:01.212 --> 38:03.247
Her family wouldn't allow that.

38:04.982 --> 38:06.450
Would you give me
the address, Leonor?

38:12.790 --> 38:15.192
Do you promise me
you won't intervene?

38:18.162 --> 38:19.130
I promise.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.003
I'll tell you.

38:47.491 --> 38:49.093
-Maria Júlia?
-Hi.

38:51.929 --> 38:53.197
What are you doing here?

38:53.264 --> 38:54.665
And you?.

38:55.132 --> 38:56.967
How did you find out
they're getting married?

38:57.668 --> 39:00.037
Who is getting married?
I'm looking for Jorge.

39:00.104 --> 39:01.138
He lives here.

39:02.473 --> 39:04.208
He must be helping
the lovebirds.

39:04.875 --> 39:05.776
Follow me.

39:14.919 --> 39:16.787
-Hi, Jorge.
-What are you doing here?

39:16.854 --> 39:20.424
We found out. Olavo and Alzira
are getting married.

39:23.127 --> 39:24.095
They are not.

39:33.771 --> 39:35.072
Yes, there's going to be
a wedding.

39:35.506 --> 39:37.141
But Alzira is marrying me.

39:40.478 --> 39:41.445
Wow!

39:42.179 --> 39:44.482
It that why you kept this
a secret?

39:44.548 --> 39:47.284
You were afraid of them knowing

39:47.351 --> 39:49.854
and thinking you were going
to lose your assets?

39:49.920 --> 39:51.188
What assets?

39:51.622 --> 39:55.092
I keep telling them
I have nothing but clothes.

39:55.993 --> 40:00.398
My family wouldn't accept me
marrying an ex-con.

40:00.464 --> 40:02.333
You're my treasure, Alzira.

40:04.769 --> 40:07.505
What could they do?

40:07.571 --> 40:10.174
They could intervene,
stop me from getting married.

40:11.108 --> 40:13.177
After this wedding, nobody
will be able to do anything.

40:13.244 --> 40:16.447
Well, all we can do
is wish you the best!

40:16.514 --> 40:17.481
Right, Raul?

40:18.449 --> 40:19.817
Yes, congratulations!

40:20.418 --> 40:22.353
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.155
Congratulations!
Congratulations, Jorge!

40:24.221 --> 40:25.356
Thank you.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.124
-Congratulations, Alzira.
-Thank you.

40:29.193 --> 40:31.028
Olavo never meant to come,
did he?

40:32.963 --> 40:33.931
No.

40:35.065 --> 40:37.001
He took advantage
of the group scape

40:37.067 --> 40:38.202
to carry on with his plans.

40:39.503 --> 40:40.471
He thought,

40:41.439 --> 40:44.408
if these two had the courage
to create their destiny,

40:45.576 --> 40:47.011
why wouldn't he do the same?

40:47.678 --> 40:49.113
He's really sick, right?

40:49.980 --> 40:51.248
Three months, at most.

40:53.083 --> 40:54.552
Tell me where he is, Sebastião.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.086
I can't.

40:57.021 --> 40:58.355
I promised
I wouldn't say anything.

40:58.422 --> 40:59.490
But I can help him.

41:00.191 --> 41:02.827
And if his family find out,
they won't forgive him.

41:02.893 --> 41:04.995
He decided to run away

41:05.629 --> 41:07.131
because his family
doesn't respect him.

41:07.198 --> 41:10.434
Olavo is not thinking clearly
right now.

41:11.101 --> 41:14.738
I tried too. But he's stubborn.
He wouldn't listen to me.

41:15.573 --> 41:17.174
I'm his only hope.

41:34.725 --> 41:35.693
Hi.

41:36.193 --> 41:37.962
I'm not good with words,

41:38.529 --> 41:40.931
but I think you shouldn't do it.

41:41.298 --> 41:43.501
From what I saw,
your family loves you very much.

41:45.870 --> 41:47.371
You thought I was going to jump?

41:50.140 --> 41:52.343
Why running away then?

41:53.511 --> 41:54.778
Isn't it obvious?

41:58.015 --> 42:00.584
They just want me to stay
flat out in bed,

42:00.651 --> 42:02.887
suffering, feeling bad,

42:02.953 --> 42:05.923
taking medicines,
receiving chemotherapy.

42:05.990 --> 42:08.158
Every single day, damn it!

42:10.327 --> 42:13.998
During the investigation,
I met your son. Júlio.

42:14.064 --> 42:17.001
You should enjoy him
a little longer.

42:19.036 --> 42:21.772
I know. I love my son too.

42:22.840 --> 42:25.042
I love my family too, of course.

42:26.710 --> 42:29.346
But death is a lonely journey.

42:30.447 --> 42:31.916
Knowing you're going to die

42:31.982 --> 42:33.784
is not the worst thing
in the world.

42:33.851 --> 42:36.153
How many people
get the chance to know,

42:36.520 --> 42:39.757
the chance to say goodbye
to their loved ones,

42:39.823 --> 42:41.191
to their family?

42:41.859 --> 42:44.795
But the love from your family

42:45.729 --> 42:47.698
is sometimes suffocating.

42:48.832 --> 42:50.701
Love should make you free.

42:51.201 --> 42:53.237
Any love.
Any type of love, you know?

42:53.304 --> 42:56.240
Love for a person.
Love for life.

42:57.308 --> 42:59.810
What is the point
if you don't spend

42:59.877 --> 43:02.680
every single day
experimenting that love?

43:02.746 --> 43:05.416
Fully. Without measure.

43:06.150 --> 43:09.653
What happens when that love
is taken from you?

43:09.720 --> 43:11.989
It's the end of everything,
the end of life.

43:13.357 --> 43:15.759
My son and my family
haven't noticed yet,

43:15.826 --> 43:17.728
but I said goodbye to them
already.

43:19.296 --> 43:22.466
Now I just need
to follow my way.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.639
I want to have the chance

43:29.340 --> 43:31.742
of leading my own story,

43:31.809 --> 43:34.778
of being the creator
of my destiny for the last time.

43:36.313 --> 43:37.281
That's what I want.

43:38.215 --> 43:39.617
Do you think
that's too much to ask?

43:43.354 --> 43:44.321
No.

44:01.972 --> 44:04.408
I was too late.

44:04.475 --> 44:06.210
Olavo had already left.

44:06.276 --> 44:09.146
Don't you have a clue
where he can be?

44:09.213 --> 44:12.116
I found a letter
he left for his family.

44:12.182 --> 44:13.250
So, he did it...

44:13.317 --> 44:15.085
On his own free will.

44:15.886 --> 44:17.655
I think his family
will understand.

44:17.721 --> 44:19.723
They'll suffer,
but they will understand.
