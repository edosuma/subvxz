00:31.200 --> 00:35.993
City by the mighty dirty river

00:36.830 --> 00:42.039
City by the greasy rolling sea

00:42.712 --> 00:45.547
I crawl so small

00:46.132 --> 00:50.343
And it stands so tall

00:50.929 --> 00:54.677
And it all belongs

00:55.057 --> 00:57.762
To me

01:00.479 --> 01:02.851
Welcome to Joe's apartment

01:02.940 --> 01:05.691
It's our apartment, too

01:05.776 --> 01:08.148
We've been around
for a hundred million years

01:08.236 --> 01:10.693
And we'll be here long after you

01:13.367 --> 01:15.989
Let's go to our place
It's a great big space

01:16.079 --> 01:18.748
It's where I wanna be

01:18.831 --> 01:21.618
Where friends all meet
And life is sweet

01:21.709 --> 01:24.036
'Cause everything's for free

01:24.130 --> 01:26.881
It's the joint, it's a gas

01:26.966 --> 01:29.455
It's a big fat boot in the ass

01:29.926 --> 01:32.677
Let's toast! Raise your glass

01:32.762 --> 01:38.882
Here's to Joe! A man with class

01:39.226 --> 01:43.141
So! Hello from Joe's apartment

01:43.230 --> 01:46.148
You're gonna love the view

01:46.400 --> 01:49.106
It's a nest that beats the rest

01:49.195 --> 01:52.065
We're so glad that you're our guest

01:52.155 --> 01:55.608
Come on in, we're all undressed

01:55.868 --> 02:02.120
Joe's apartment, we welcome you!

02:03.877 --> 02:05.370
Nice singing!

02:06.963 --> 02:08.539
The movie's starting.

02:36.033 --> 02:39.199
Dear Mom,
I made it to New York safe and sound.

02:39.286 --> 02:41.030
Hands up, pinhead!

02:57.640 --> 02:59.927
Dear Mom, I made it to New York.

03:00.016 --> 03:01.760
Hands up, pinhead!

03:11.069 --> 03:12.100
Dear Mom--

03:12.195 --> 03:13.938
Hands up, pinhead!

03:14.155 --> 03:15.186
Please send money.

03:35.593 --> 03:38.797
Don 't worry, Mom, I'll pay you back soon.
I'm bound to get a job.

03:38.889 --> 03:40.882
I'm a college graduate.

03:43.310 --> 03:46.725
But first things first.
I got to get an apartment.

03:46.854 --> 03:49.144
I hope I can get one really cheap.

03:49.357 --> 03:51.350
$1,500 a month?

03:52.068 --> 03:54.393
There's a hole in the ceiling.

03:54.779 --> 03:56.737
It's a private atrium.

04:00.494 --> 04:03.945
$1,100 a month for 300 square feet.

04:04.206 --> 04:06.079
That's a sweet deal.

04:07.458 --> 04:08.572
No vacancy.

04:08.667 --> 04:09.912
$1,500 a month.

04:10.002 --> 04:11.913
Nothing for that price range.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.375
Try Nebraska.

04:33.569 --> 04:36.320
Oh, my God, mister. Are you all right?

04:41.284 --> 04:45.661
Two days, seven hours,
twenty-three minutes and four seconds.

04:46.748 --> 04:49.120
That's how long I've been lying here.

04:50.752 --> 04:52.245
Are you okay?

04:53.963 --> 04:56.917
Of course not. I'm an artist.

05:01.805 --> 05:05.388
I wanted to express how cold,
how pitiless this city really is.

05:05.475 --> 05:07.514
Nobody touched you for two days?

05:07.602 --> 05:09.310
Spitting doesn't count.

05:11.023 --> 05:13.312
You must be from out of town.

05:13.610 --> 05:14.723
Yeah.

05:15.735 --> 05:16.934
Iowa.

05:18.196 --> 05:20.604
-What's your name?
-Joe.

05:20.866 --> 05:22.692
Walter. Walter Shit.

05:23.660 --> 05:25.118
Walter Shit?

05:25.787 --> 05:26.783
Yeah.

05:27.873 --> 05:29.035
Yeah.

05:32.002 --> 05:33.829
Looking for a place?

05:34.087 --> 05:35.997
Something for $100 a month.

05:39.217 --> 05:44.093
Hey, junior here thinks he's going to find
his own rent-controlled apartment!

05:49.603 --> 05:51.476
Rent-controlled apartment?

05:51.563 --> 05:52.678
Yeah.

05:52.773 --> 05:56.641
A place where the rent's been frozen
since the 1950s.

05:57.070 --> 05:59.904
Those places are hard to find
because no one ever leaves them.

05:59.988 --> 06:03.322
Not unless the landlord gives them
a little help.

06:55.085 --> 06:57.124
I love the real estate business.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.352
They're tougher than they look.

07:13.437 --> 07:17.102
See? There's really no way
to get a rent-controlled apartment.

07:17.191 --> 07:18.353
No way at all?

07:18.441 --> 07:21.396
I mean, only if
it's your mom's apartment...

07:21.487 --> 07:22.945
and she croaks.

07:23.405 --> 07:25.398
How you doing, Mrs. Grotowski?

07:29.995 --> 07:31.406
Oh, my God!

07:34.458 --> 07:38.206
Joe, Mrs. Grotowski doesn't have
any family.

07:38.754 --> 07:41.624
You pose as her son, take her apartment.

07:41.924 --> 07:43.039
What?

07:43.467 --> 07:45.210
I couldn't!

07:47.346 --> 07:49.089
Oh, my God!

07:49.431 --> 07:50.546
Joe!

07:52.267 --> 07:54.259
It's your mother!

07:55.853 --> 07:58.180
And she's dead!

08:01.861 --> 08:03.023
Thank you.

08:08.910 --> 08:10.487
My first place!

08:24.299 --> 08:25.462
Quiet!

08:25.551 --> 08:27.295
Got to hide! Got to hide!

08:27.387 --> 08:30.304
-Never seen him around before.
-Where's the old lady?

08:30.389 --> 08:33.224
-Luggage! I don't like it!
-Stay undercover.

08:33.308 --> 08:34.886
Right, another stupid human.

08:34.977 --> 08:36.933
-Shut up!
-Can it, both of you.

08:43.861 --> 08:45.142
Oh, no!

08:48.074 --> 08:49.947
Yummy, yummy!

08:56.958 --> 08:59.663
Damn. Ralph's out there. Poor sucker.

09:08.218 --> 09:12.216
This is the greasiest,
ugliest bug I've ever seen in my life.

09:19.396 --> 09:21.722
-Look at that.
-Our kind of guy.

09:21.816 --> 09:23.807
He likes good living. That's for sure.

09:23.900 --> 09:26.225
-He's not so bad.
-He's got potential.

09:27.530 --> 09:30.649
Did you hear that? "Greasy."
Nice compliment.

09:31.033 --> 09:32.860
I thought you was smushed for sure.

09:32.952 --> 09:34.280
Who's out there?

09:34.370 --> 09:36.659
Schlomo and Pauli, who else?

09:37.206 --> 09:40.824
-Schlomo, I quit drinking.
-Me, too, Pauli.

09:40.918 --> 09:44.833
Ever since I joined this health club.
It's a great lap pool.

09:45.590 --> 09:47.167
Diver down.

09:48.092 --> 09:49.717
We're gonna get drunk.

09:49.802 --> 09:53.503
Hold on. He's having a taste
of Old Hound Dog instead.

09:53.598 --> 09:55.424
I'll drink to that.

10:11.197 --> 10:15.030
I can't tell you how happy I am
to be finally out on my own, Mom.

10:15.203 --> 10:17.030
No, no thanks, Mom.

10:17.122 --> 10:20.325
I can find a job by myself.
Look how easy I got a place.

10:21.584 --> 10:22.912
Yes, Mom.

10:23.127 --> 10:26.212
No, Mom. Right, Mom. Good, Mom.

10:26.756 --> 10:29.295
Isn't his mom supposed to be dead?

10:30.970 --> 10:32.343
Landlord!

10:41.229 --> 10:43.980
I hope everything's going fine
up in heaven, Mom.

10:44.065 --> 10:46.638
Pray to you later. Amen!

10:46.734 --> 10:49.023
Joe, who are you talking to?

10:54.157 --> 10:55.782
Who the hell are you?

10:56.577 --> 10:58.700
Joe Grotowski.

10:59.455 --> 11:01.613
Joe F. Grotowski.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.160
Vladimir Bianco.

11:04.752 --> 11:06.460
My cousin, Jesus.

11:07.422 --> 11:09.379
Vlad and Jesus Bianco?

11:09.882 --> 11:11.543
You are related?

11:12.009 --> 11:14.299
Speaking of relations,
I knew your old lady...

11:14.388 --> 11:17.056
and she never talked you up! Not once!

11:17.140 --> 11:19.891
-I've been away at college.
-ls that so?

11:19.976 --> 11:22.598
Well, $50 rent, college boy.

11:22.854 --> 11:25.012
-Cash!
-Now!

11:29.235 --> 11:31.311
Sorry about your moms, man.

11:31.404 --> 11:34.191
But maybe you won't be missing her long.

11:35.450 --> 11:36.778
Amen.

11:46.878 --> 11:50.081
Dear Mom, thanks for another loan.

11:50.715 --> 11:52.541
I haven 't found a job yet...

11:52.633 --> 11:55.255
but I'm on the lookout for something good.

12:38.430 --> 12:40.552
Thank you for calling 91 1.

12:40.640 --> 12:44.259
Your call is important to us.
Please stay on the line.

12:44.478 --> 12:48.309
Your local police precinct
will be with you shortly.

12:55.530 --> 12:57.654
Central Complaint Department,
please hold.

12:57.741 --> 12:59.864
I don't know. Please hold.

13:00.827 --> 13:03.033
I can't help you. Please hold.

13:03.121 --> 13:05.659
Like, who cares, man? Please hold.

13:05.790 --> 13:09.573
Alligators in the subway.
Interesting, ma'am. Please hold.

13:11.128 --> 13:15.341
No, sir. Don't try to saw it off yourself.
Please hold.

13:19.054 --> 13:23.347
-Central Complaint Department.
-I'm calling from 324 1/2 East 8th Street.

13:24.184 --> 13:27.718
No water, no heat, no power.

13:28.313 --> 13:30.887
Roof leaking, drug dealing.

13:30.983 --> 13:33.308
People falling out of windows?

13:34.569 --> 13:38.152
Congratulations, sir.
This is the worst call I've had all day!

13:38.239 --> 13:39.319
Really?

13:44.705 --> 13:46.661
Coffee break!

13:48.500 --> 13:49.994
Please hold.

13:51.795 --> 13:52.993
Hello?

14:06.936 --> 14:08.346
Lily, what's up?

14:08.436 --> 14:10.264
Oh, Blank. Hey.

14:11.356 --> 14:14.856
This garden of yours
is really coming along.

14:14.985 --> 14:18.353
-Quite a change from the old air shaft.
-Oh, yeah.

14:18.863 --> 14:21.781
It's such a relief after all those calls.

14:25.204 --> 14:26.828
It ain't bad now.

14:26.913 --> 14:29.534
Wait till there's a riot or a fire!

14:30.459 --> 14:31.918
Serious O.T.

14:32.044 --> 14:36.089
I wish we could do something
other than put people on hold.

14:36.756 --> 14:40.171
What are you doing
in this dead-end city department anyway?

14:40.259 --> 14:42.299
Child, go work for your dad.

14:42.386 --> 14:44.843
The man's a U.S. senator.

14:45.390 --> 14:48.640
Wear a nice dress, sit next to his podium.

14:48.810 --> 14:52.144
You could get into politics, easy.

15:07.871 --> 15:10.243
-Mr. Bianco.
-Check it out.

15:10.332 --> 15:13.083
Please, Senator, just call me Alberto.

15:13.168 --> 15:15.790
Have you brought me good news, Alberto?

15:15.880 --> 15:19.794
My second to the last tenant
has just taken flight, Senator.

15:20.134 --> 15:22.292
We two saw her off personally.

15:22.386 --> 15:25.635
Wonderful. She'll love the condo
you bought her.

15:25.888 --> 15:28.509
Nothing is too good for my tenants.

15:28.849 --> 15:30.559
And how about your last tenant?

15:30.644 --> 15:33.016
We made his final arrangements.

15:34.315 --> 15:36.556
And soon the building will be yours.

15:36.859 --> 15:40.726
The U.S. government will have
acquired the last property we need...

15:41.781 --> 15:43.358
for the brand new...

15:44.367 --> 15:45.566
Manhattan...

15:46.577 --> 15:48.368
maximum security...

15:48.454 --> 15:50.245
federal penitentiary.

15:52.625 --> 15:55.032
The biggest prison in the world.

15:57.421 --> 16:00.043
Whatever happened
to the Lower East Side?

16:00.632 --> 16:02.590
How did it decay so badly...

16:03.177 --> 16:06.131
that the only thing
that'll sprout in its soil...

16:06.222 --> 16:07.301
is a jail?

16:07.390 --> 16:09.715
We can't take all the credit for that.

16:09.808 --> 16:12.013
But we're glad we could help.

16:22.612 --> 16:24.653
Oh, look at those kids.

16:24.990 --> 16:27.446
They could get hurt,
playing in this empty lot.

16:27.534 --> 16:30.453
I used to get plenty of cuts
and scratches...

16:30.538 --> 16:33.030
but that's all there is around here.

16:34.833 --> 16:36.162
Hi, guys.

16:36.669 --> 16:38.163
What are you making?

16:38.253 --> 16:39.748
A crack house.

16:42.341 --> 16:43.800
Oh, my God.

16:44.468 --> 16:45.843
This is awful.

16:45.928 --> 16:49.261
This should be a public garden,
with safe places for kids to play...

16:49.348 --> 16:50.807
with flowers and trees.

16:50.892 --> 16:54.343
Lily, this ain't no cute little
building atrium.

16:54.520 --> 16:57.010
This is the nastiest neighborhood
in New York City.

16:57.856 --> 16:59.397
Come on, girl.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.519
-Conference.
-What's up, Ralph?

17:40.608 --> 17:44.937
This new guy, Joe. He don't wash,
clean, vacuum. He don't give a crap.

17:45.029 --> 17:47.780
He's the dirtiest slob on the planet.

17:48.491 --> 17:50.530
I think I'm in love.

17:50.951 --> 17:52.861
-Me, too, Ralph.
-I vote we keep him.

17:52.954 --> 17:54.578
We got to break him in, that's all.

17:57.958 --> 17:59.417
Oh, my gosh!

18:10.263 --> 18:13.466
Looks like the landlord
wants to change Joe's lease.

18:13.557 --> 18:15.266
They aren't doing no paint job.

18:17.520 --> 18:21.470
Let's not kid ourselves.
If Joe gets greased, we're next.

18:21.566 --> 18:25.564
I won't stand for it!
Let's teach them toe-heads some respect!

18:27.320 --> 18:29.230
Roaches to the rescue!

18:29.656 --> 18:32.195
I love the smell of this old couch.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.491
-Double time! Double time!
-Hang on!

18:34.578 --> 18:37.152
Hurry! These goons will bust Joe's skull!

18:37.498 --> 18:38.577
He knows it, too.

18:38.666 --> 18:40.873
-Feel him shaking?
-Spring is in the air.

18:40.960 --> 18:43.368
-Stay cool, Joe.
-Take it easy, Joe.

18:43.463 --> 18:46.001
Don't worry, Joe. We got your back.

18:46.091 --> 18:47.171
Who....

18:50.720 --> 18:52.677
Where is he?

19:10.698 --> 19:13.782
-Troops! Antennas up!
-Sir, yes, sir!

19:14.743 --> 19:16.369
Bombs away!

19:18.330 --> 19:20.205
Give me a kiss, asshole.

19:21.458 --> 19:23.119
God, they talk?

19:23.419 --> 19:26.669
That's right!
I'm about to kick your ass, too!

19:27.173 --> 19:28.833
Disgusting little....

19:29.091 --> 19:32.128
Your mama's cooking sucks!
I wouldn't even touch it.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.679
I think he got me! He got me!

19:42.814 --> 19:46.017
I'm heading up to that big Dumpster
in the sky.

19:46.568 --> 19:48.145
You missed!

19:58.453 --> 20:00.612
Over here, fruitcake.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.245
Let's go!

20:06.796 --> 20:08.872
It's a roach clip. Get it?

20:13.511 --> 20:15.469
Now you're in trouble!

20:17.182 --> 20:19.425
Ought to stomp your freaking head!

20:25.398 --> 20:28.067
Slip on something more comfortable.

20:30.112 --> 20:33.694
Hiya, Hansel and Gretel,
lay off our buddy Joe.

20:34.949 --> 20:37.985
-Okay. Just let us go, please!
-Are you listening?

20:38.077 --> 20:41.695
Because if you ain't, you'll get a roach
in every meal you'll ever have...

20:41.789 --> 20:43.828
for the rest of your freaking life!

20:43.916 --> 20:45.742
-You got that?
-Yeah!

20:45.834 --> 20:47.543
We know where you live!

20:47.879 --> 20:50.085
We live where you live.

21:00.850 --> 21:02.560
-What a fall!
-Leaving so soon?

21:02.645 --> 21:04.969
-The party's just started!
-See you.

21:05.063 --> 21:06.557
Hate to be you!

21:13.029 --> 21:15.187
-A spare!
-You was robbed!

21:16.408 --> 21:19.942
You was great, Ralphie.
What a couple of pansies.

21:20.036 --> 21:22.075
Joe, are you all right?

21:23.665 --> 21:24.780
Get back!

21:24.875 --> 21:26.368
-Joe.
-Buddy!

21:26.459 --> 21:30.326
-That ain't no way to treat your friends.
-My friends?

21:30.421 --> 21:35.167
Sure! We like the way you run things here,
so we wanted to keep you around.

21:37.428 --> 21:38.923
You can talk.

21:39.097 --> 21:41.635
Talk? We can sing!

21:44.018 --> 21:45.762
Garbage

21:45.854 --> 21:48.559
Garbage

21:48.691 --> 21:51.856
Garbage

21:52.444 --> 21:53.523
Sorry.

21:54.071 --> 21:56.740
The garbage in the moonlight

21:56.823 --> 21:59.943
Gives off a lovely smell

22:00.076 --> 22:02.614
Sipping sewage with my baby

22:02.704 --> 22:05.278
In our little roach motel

22:05.374 --> 22:09.073
Please, don 't tell

22:20.930 --> 22:25.509
On an ocean trip on a garbage ship
With a cockroach I adore

22:25.602 --> 22:30.478
We 'll take a taste of the medical waste
That washes up on shore

22:30.566 --> 22:33.022
Oh, sweetheart, say you love me

22:33.111 --> 22:35.861
And crawl underneath my rug

22:35.946 --> 22:39.564
You're one in a thousand billion, baby

22:39.658 --> 22:44.284
Oh, won 't you be my bug?

22:44.413 --> 22:47.283
Oh, won 't you be my bug?

22:47.374 --> 22:52.120
Please, be my bug

23:10.814 --> 23:12.723
God, what a nightmare.

23:34.254 --> 23:36.331
I'm up. I'm up already.

23:56.985 --> 23:59.986
-What's that?
-I'm trying to get some shuteye here.

24:00.447 --> 24:02.654
Morning. My name's Ralph Roach.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.534
This is my associate, Rodney Roach.

24:04.619 --> 24:06.242
What's happening, Joe?

24:07.496 --> 24:09.536
Another hot and muggy, Joe?

24:09.664 --> 24:12.832
-What are you doing on my breakfast?
-Little nosh, that's all.

24:12.918 --> 24:15.409
-How's it hanging today?
-Word up.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.294
How do you like the Knicks?

24:18.465 --> 24:19.924
How many of you are there?

24:20.009 --> 24:24.054
This apartment? Not a lot.
About 20,000, 30,000, 40,000.

24:24.179 --> 24:26.053
Mostly family, you know.

24:26.140 --> 24:27.765
-And you can talk?
-Sure.

24:27.849 --> 24:30.636
We just don't talk much.
Not to people, anyhow.

24:30.727 --> 24:33.978
No point. People smush first,
and ask questions later.

24:34.064 --> 24:36.472
But not you, brother. You're different.

24:36.817 --> 24:38.276
Oh, yeah?

24:46.868 --> 24:48.281
Joe, Joe!

24:48.371 --> 24:51.537
Let's be friends.
We just saved your life, remember?

24:51.623 --> 24:52.869
Besides, Joe...

24:52.959 --> 24:56.659
if those two friends of yours come back,
we might come in useful.

24:56.754 --> 25:00.088
So, how about
a live-and-let-live philosophy here?

25:01.174 --> 25:03.298
"Slobs of a feather swarm together."

25:03.386 --> 25:05.212
-Makes sense to me.
-That's fair.

25:05.304 --> 25:07.096
-What's yours is ours.
-Stereo rights?

25:07.181 --> 25:09.054
Just warn us before you flush.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.885
I got to get out of here.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.895
-Where are you going?
-None of your business.

25:15.980 --> 25:18.899
-Mind if we hang out with you?
-Yes!

25:19.735 --> 25:21.527
-Come on!
-Don't be that way, Joey!

25:21.612 --> 25:22.726
Can't we? Please?

25:22.821 --> 25:25.277
-You won't even notice us.
-We'll be good.

25:25.366 --> 25:26.563
What's up his butt?

25:26.658 --> 25:30.988
We ought to keep an eye on him,
in case he needs our help.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.832
-Right as usual, Ralph.
-Excellent idea, Ralph.

26:01.025 --> 26:02.306
Ritardo's!

26:03.737 --> 26:06.146
Come on in. The cheese is fine.

26:07.157 --> 26:08.652
You're fired!

26:09.368 --> 26:11.776
Here are your enlargements, sir.

26:15.124 --> 26:16.535
You're fired!

26:17.334 --> 26:18.414
You're fired!

26:20.297 --> 26:22.169
-You're fired!
-You're fired!

26:26.385 --> 26:29.006
Poor Joe. Having trouble keeping a job.

26:29.138 --> 26:30.763
We're doing our best to help.

26:30.848 --> 26:32.887
Guess we got to keep on trying.

26:34.435 --> 26:37.934
-Love this guy! Breakfast?
-Don't mind if I do.

26:41.943 --> 26:45.108
-Don't panic or nothing.
-What do you mean?

26:45.195 --> 26:47.187
Well, it appears to me...

26:47.280 --> 26:51.231
that one of our most dreaded
natural enemies somehow got in!

26:51.827 --> 26:52.907
Oh, my God!

26:52.996 --> 26:55.403
Joe, wake up! A cat!

26:58.876 --> 27:00.750
Don't let it get me!

27:06.760 --> 27:08.751
How's everybody doing tonight?

27:11.180 --> 27:13.173
Thank you! Good-looking crowd.

27:13.683 --> 27:15.640
Anybody here from New Jersey?

27:16.143 --> 27:17.519
What exit?

27:18.020 --> 27:19.266
He's dying out there.

27:19.356 --> 27:22.142
Some pretty cool cats from there:
Sinatra, Bruce.

27:22.233 --> 27:24.439
Say, nice set of whiskers, sir.

27:25.361 --> 27:27.519
Poor Ralphie. I can't look!

27:31.282 --> 27:33.442
It's Cousin Tiny from Texas!

27:33.536 --> 27:36.241
Howdy, cousins! Just buzzing through!

27:36.331 --> 27:39.248
Let's have ourselves a little rodeo!

27:49.136 --> 27:51.093
It's chicken-pickin ', finger-lickin ' good

27:51.180 --> 27:52.922
I got my honey in a sunny neighborhood

27:53.013 --> 27:54.971
It's a wrassling, hassling, dazzling show

27:55.058 --> 27:58.593
Grab a lady and do-si-do
A little bitty kitty-cat rodeo

28:14.827 --> 28:16.534
Scrape it, Clyde!

28:17.621 --> 28:20.327
Now you ought to bring your daughter
'cause it's hotter

28:20.417 --> 28:22.872
When he's shaking and a-baking
and breaking it in

28:22.960 --> 28:25.332
He's a-gripping, he's a-slipping

28:25.796 --> 28:29.130
Come on, mister, bring your sister
Bring her to the rodeo

28:30.885 --> 28:32.166
Go, Joe!

28:32.262 --> 28:34.255
-Go, Joe!
-Attaboy, Joe!

28:35.516 --> 28:39.430
-Look at those claws digging into his face!
-That's got to hurt!

28:42.606 --> 28:44.681
Good arm, Joe! Good arm!

28:49.946 --> 28:51.985
You saved my life!

28:52.365 --> 28:56.315
No human being has ever saved the life
of a cockroach.

28:58.204 --> 29:02.117
This is a breakthrough
in "interspecio" diplomacy!

29:02.791 --> 29:05.995
Yeah? Well, stop following me
to work already!

29:06.087 --> 29:08.495
-For God's sake!
-You got it, Joe.

29:08.590 --> 29:10.499
-Forget about it.
-Don't worry.

29:10.592 --> 29:12.549
We don't follow you to work no more.

29:12.635 --> 29:15.043
Yeah, right. I've heard that before.

29:16.305 --> 29:19.641
Give me a "J"! Give me an "O"! An "E"!

29:19.727 --> 29:21.766
-What's that spell?
-Joe!

29:22.021 --> 29:24.226
-What's that spell?
-Joe!

29:24.856 --> 29:29.103
Dear Mom, the job situation
has been a little tricky.

29:29.736 --> 29:32.856
But I know I'm going to land
something soon.

29:38.745 --> 29:40.287
Congratulate me.

29:40.372 --> 29:42.993
This is the first of my works to use paint!

29:43.833 --> 29:46.619
I call this piece lnstant Minority.

29:47.336 --> 29:48.961
I did the whole block.

29:49.547 --> 29:52.299
But people are black or white or brown.

29:52.384 --> 29:54.043
Nobody's purple!

29:56.179 --> 29:57.638
Periwinkle!

29:57.806 --> 30:00.759
You're now the world's smallest minority.

30:00.850 --> 30:03.603
How am I supposed to get a job
looking like this?

30:03.686 --> 30:05.479
-You know how to play drums?
-No.

30:05.564 --> 30:07.225
Perfect! You want a job?

30:11.110 --> 30:16.022
I'm doing a musical performance.
You can sit in for my drummer. He's dead.

30:16.157 --> 30:17.569
Well, sure.

30:17.659 --> 30:19.402
What? He's dead?

30:19.494 --> 30:21.321
Actually, it's a very funny story.

30:21.413 --> 30:25.162
There's a crack dealer in our building
and my drummer called him--

30:26.960 --> 30:31.502
Slit his throat so badly that his own mom
couldn't identify him at the morgue.

30:32.423 --> 30:34.000
I'll miss that guy.

30:34.091 --> 30:35.634
Is it a deal?

30:37.011 --> 30:39.799
Excellent. Here. You can put these up.

30:41.307 --> 30:44.225
That's a cool name for a band.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.363
Shit.

31:04.039 --> 31:05.498
-Hi.
-Hi.

31:05.873 --> 31:07.333
It's a band.

31:07.667 --> 31:08.948
What is?

31:09.961 --> 31:11.076
This.

31:13.007 --> 31:14.465
That's nice.

31:16.300 --> 31:18.293
I'm the drummer.

31:18.594 --> 31:20.090
We kick ass.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.055
I guess you must.

31:24.601 --> 31:26.393
What are those for?

31:26.854 --> 31:29.344
It's a community garden.

31:29.564 --> 31:33.942
We'll plant flowers and have a playground
for kids, vegetables for families.

31:35.196 --> 31:36.441
Cool.

31:36.531 --> 31:40.777
Yeah, but the lot is totally bare of soil.
We'll need fertilizer.

31:41.201 --> 31:43.443
-Fertilizer?
-Yeah, a lot of it.

31:43.537 --> 31:46.241
And then I saw your sign. I thought...

31:46.331 --> 31:48.620
that is exactly what we need.

31:51.545 --> 31:53.751
Well, maybe I can help out.

31:54.548 --> 31:56.457
Wonderful. I'm Lily.

31:57.884 --> 31:59.083
I'm Joe.

32:17.029 --> 32:21.277
Dear Lily, it was great to meet you.
I'm into gardening, too.

32:21.451 --> 32:25.400
I can plant trees,
weed flowers, dig bulbs....

32:25.496 --> 32:28.865
Boobs, Joe, not bulbs!
Tell her you dig her boobs!

32:28.958 --> 32:30.950
Dames like compliments!

32:32.753 --> 32:37.331
Nothing like the sight of a woman with
a sack of grubs hanging off her abdomen.

32:37.424 --> 32:40.379
Can't you see
I'm trying to have some privacy?

32:41.511 --> 32:45.011
Hey, Joe, what's this idea
you people keep kicking about "privacy"?

32:45.098 --> 32:47.671
Explain it to us. We don't get it.

32:48.183 --> 32:50.641
People need to be alone sometimes.

32:50.729 --> 32:53.849
That's a false philosophic concept.

32:54.149 --> 32:56.984
-You are never alone.
-Not in New York City.

32:57.069 --> 33:00.817
Us roaches see everything you do.
So what? We're all friends here.

33:00.906 --> 33:02.732
Okay. Fine. Shut up.

33:03.450 --> 33:04.695
Oh, I like that.

33:04.785 --> 33:06.862
-"Shut up," he says.
-Shut up yourself.

33:06.954 --> 33:09.624
-No manners, this guy.
-Who needs you?

33:09.832 --> 33:12.370
-So long, Romeo.
-I bet she's a dog.

33:20.676 --> 33:23.511
Dear Lily, I want to help your garden.

33:23.679 --> 33:27.724
That's "plow your garden," Joe.
Tell her you want to plow her.

33:33.688 --> 33:35.598
I said shut up already!

33:35.690 --> 33:36.889
Come on, Joe!

33:36.984 --> 33:39.688
Dames secretly like it
when you give them shit.

33:39.778 --> 33:42.696
We need fertilizer. Lots ofit.

33:46.868 --> 33:48.067
What are you doing?

33:48.162 --> 33:51.247
Giving you a neck rub.
You seem a little tense.

33:51.374 --> 33:53.781
-Okay, okay! We're gone!
-Chill out.

34:30.454 --> 34:31.569
Wait.

34:31.996 --> 34:33.456
Hey, get out!

35:41.609 --> 35:45.358
You've got to be more careful
with those enthusiastic greetings.

35:45.446 --> 35:47.070
I'm an old man.

35:47.239 --> 35:48.733
Oh, Daddy.

35:49.825 --> 35:54.154
I got a call from your job supervisor
the other day.

35:54.914 --> 35:59.327
He told me that you're spending
a lot of time in that little atrium of yours.

35:59.418 --> 36:01.293
But I must insist....

36:04.799 --> 36:07.505
Tell me where you got those earrings.

36:08.970 --> 36:10.085
Saks.

36:10.388 --> 36:13.970
The atrium is just a dry run
for my first big project.

36:14.267 --> 36:17.801
What? I'm sorry, a project? What project?

36:17.895 --> 36:20.813
I'm starting a community garden
in the East Village.

36:20.898 --> 36:22.975
That's nice. Whereabouts?

36:23.193 --> 36:26.396
East 8th Street in Avenue B.
In your old neighborhood.

36:26.488 --> 36:28.480
Isn't this great, Daddy?

36:28.573 --> 36:29.771
Pumpkin...

36:29.866 --> 36:32.866
I'm building a federal prison on that site.

36:34.452 --> 36:37.408
A prison?
In the middle of the East Village?

36:37.832 --> 36:41.781
Why not? With all the crime and drugs,
it's already a prison.

36:44.464 --> 36:47.299
Not until my 30-day
gardening permit expires.

36:47.383 --> 36:51.215
And by that time,
I'll have the whole East Village behind me.

36:51.304 --> 36:53.463
Now, if you'll excuse me...

36:54.850 --> 36:56.722
I have some mulching to do.

37:12.659 --> 37:14.567
Hey, what's that smell?

37:14.660 --> 37:16.903
-It's odoriferous.
-It's "splendoriferous."

37:16.996 --> 37:21.290
-Joe, you are a prince among men.
-Always thinking of your buddies.

37:23.044 --> 37:24.123
Letter for Ralph.

37:24.212 --> 37:26.288
-Mail call!
-Anything for me?

37:26.589 --> 37:29.045
-Letter for Rodney.
-A postcard from Uncle Sid.

37:29.133 --> 37:30.462
How is Tampa?

37:30.635 --> 37:32.094
Garbage magazine?

37:32.179 --> 37:34.586
-Thanks a bunch, Joe!
-My sex toy arrived yet?

37:34.681 --> 37:36.472
Junk mail, junk mail.

37:36.557 --> 37:38.219
Hey, one for me.

37:38.310 --> 37:39.971
-It's from Mom.
-No kidding.

37:40.062 --> 37:42.469
-How is the old bag?
-Be respectful.

37:42.564 --> 37:44.472
Joe knows I'm kidding!

37:45.817 --> 37:49.649
"Dear Joe, got you a job interview
with P.I. Smith & Sons.

37:49.738 --> 37:52.311
"The boss is
my old high school classmate."

37:52.407 --> 37:56.405
-P.I. Smith & Sons? Great company.
-You've heard of them?

37:56.494 --> 37:58.783
They're the biggest manufacturer
in New York.

37:58.871 --> 38:00.330
What do they make?

38:02.500 --> 38:07.078
When I was about your age,
I woke up one morning and said to myself:

38:07.172 --> 38:08.832
"Urinal cake.

38:08.924 --> 38:10.667
"That's the future."

38:11.509 --> 38:12.672
So...

38:13.094 --> 38:16.261
I decided to aim
for men's room manufacturing.

38:17.765 --> 38:21.597
Now I'm the richest man
in the urinal sanitation industry.

38:23.231 --> 38:26.349
Twenty million men
piss on my name everyday.

38:27.775 --> 38:29.151
That's great, sir.

38:29.235 --> 38:31.274
So, you're an lowa boy, like me.

38:31.362 --> 38:33.901
Yes, sir. Went to Murchison High School.

38:33.990 --> 38:35.781
Good old Murchison.

38:35.992 --> 38:37.570
"Go, Bullfrogs! "

38:39.704 --> 38:43.749
My mom could do that cheer really well.
She was a varsity cheerleader.

38:43.833 --> 38:45.376
I remember.

38:45.877 --> 38:48.830
Your mom was the hottest tomato
in school.

38:53.927 --> 38:57.711
Does your mom still wear her hair
in that sexy way?

39:00.600 --> 39:03.970
Does mischief still sparkle in her eye...

39:05.146 --> 39:06.557
that minx?

39:08.025 --> 39:12.022
Mommy still got that saucy swing
to her hips?

39:15.114 --> 39:17.238
Did Mommy ever give you...

39:17.618 --> 39:19.111
a sponge bath?

39:21.538 --> 39:24.872
Welcome to the research department
for P.I. Smith & Sons.

39:24.958 --> 39:28.908
You will play an essential role
in our quest for the perfect urinal cake:

39:29.004 --> 39:30.747
Used product retrieval.

39:30.839 --> 39:34.420
Your first assignment, retrieve
all used product from the restrooms...

39:34.508 --> 39:37.712
at 58 East 161st Street, the Bronx.

39:37.804 --> 39:40.924
Deliver them to the research department
for testing.

39:41.224 --> 39:43.894
58 East 161st Street.

39:44.602 --> 39:47.604
58 East 161st....

39:58.158 --> 39:59.568
Joe's here!

40:00.368 --> 40:02.444
Let him watch. He's okay.

40:03.288 --> 40:04.367
What's this?

40:04.456 --> 40:07.410
Channel R.
The roach public access channel.

40:08.085 --> 40:10.041
You roaches have your own channel?

40:10.128 --> 40:11.457
Shut up!

40:18.804 --> 40:22.219
Are you ready
for something itsy-bitsy, baby?

40:23.851 --> 40:26.970
Come and get it, you greasy little tick.

40:27.479 --> 40:30.397
Oh, my God! I'm going to pupate!

40:32.692 --> 40:34.436
You so fine, baby.

40:34.820 --> 40:37.393
Bloats up your crop, don't it, Joe?

40:50.877 --> 40:52.253
Hey, Joe!

40:53.214 --> 40:56.380
-What is it now?
-You seem a little down.

40:56.467 --> 40:57.960
Are you okay?

40:58.427 --> 40:59.707
Just great.

40:59.845 --> 41:02.051
I'm lonely, my job sucks...

41:02.389 --> 41:05.721
and I'm in love with a girl
who's got a boyfriend.

41:05.975 --> 41:08.549
My life has totally turned to shit.

41:08.812 --> 41:11.054
Funny thing about shit, Joe.

41:11.357 --> 41:14.311
-Good stuff grows out of it.
-Yeah, right.

41:14.819 --> 41:18.234
You don't believe me?
Check out that bag in the corner.

41:54.024 --> 41:56.597
Where do you want this stupid bush?

41:57.987 --> 41:59.694
Right over there.

42:00.113 --> 42:02.071
Isn't this great, Blank?

42:03.074 --> 42:04.403
This is not my thing.

42:04.493 --> 42:06.616
Why did I say yes to this?

42:10.000 --> 42:11.280
For you.

42:12.168 --> 42:14.207
Elephicalia vermilius?

42:15.129 --> 42:17.336
I did my senior thesis on this flower.

42:17.423 --> 42:20.377
It's only found
in Sri Lankan elephant habitats.

42:20.468 --> 42:23.041
It loves rotting, moist conditions.

42:28.393 --> 42:29.637
You know....

42:30.519 --> 42:33.057
It's a terrific planting for the garden.

42:34.315 --> 42:35.559
Good.

42:35.773 --> 42:36.936
Thanks.

42:39.153 --> 42:40.896
What's "P.I.S. & S?"

42:43.073 --> 42:45.825
It's the bank I work for.

42:47.411 --> 42:50.910
"Prudential lnvestment Stocks
and Security Savings...."

42:52.959 --> 42:55.284
I thought you played in a band.

42:55.796 --> 42:56.875
I do.

42:57.464 --> 42:58.625
But...

42:59.632 --> 43:02.122
banking is kind of like my trade.

43:02.259 --> 43:04.881
I'm sort of a rock-and-roll banker.

43:06.013 --> 43:08.339
You wear these overalls to work?

43:12.020 --> 43:13.430
What's this?

43:16.106 --> 43:19.771
Those are super-mulching pellets.

43:19.860 --> 43:22.185
Great for growing things.

43:22.279 --> 43:25.779
-I've never seen them before.
-It's a new technology.

43:26.534 --> 43:29.107
Could you get some of these
for the garden?

43:30.455 --> 43:32.114
As many as you want!

43:36.544 --> 43:37.954
Thank you.

43:38.671 --> 43:40.166
You're great.

43:42.300 --> 43:45.383
On one condition:
You come see my band tomorrow night.

43:45.469 --> 43:47.592
I can put you on the list.

43:49.431 --> 43:50.974
I don't know.

43:51.643 --> 43:52.970
Come on.

43:57.189 --> 43:59.348
Can't resist a man in a uniform.

44:06.239 --> 44:08.528
Thank you for tuning into Alternative Life.

44:08.616 --> 44:11.191
New York's only truly underground forum.

44:11.287 --> 44:12.947
We continue last week's discussion:

44:13.039 --> 44:16.158
"How can we promote better
understanding between species?"

44:16.250 --> 44:18.242
Lay off the rat jokes!

44:18.335 --> 44:21.337
How many rats does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

44:21.423 --> 44:23.664
How'd you like a punch in the beak,
wise guy?

44:23.758 --> 44:25.585
Lay off the bird, sewer breath!

44:25.677 --> 44:27.551
Go gnaw some nuts!

44:27.721 --> 44:29.428
Can 't we all just get along?

44:29.513 --> 44:30.593
No!

44:36.187 --> 44:37.266
Now, guys--

44:37.355 --> 44:39.763
-Out of the way.
-We're watching Charlie Roach.

44:39.858 --> 44:41.565
I've got a date tonight.

44:42.777 --> 44:44.235
Is she cute?

44:44.320 --> 44:46.776
-About time, Joey!
-Porkola time, buddy.

44:46.865 --> 44:49.355
-So I want you to stay out of sight.
-Who, us?

44:49.450 --> 44:51.821
-Sure, Joey.
-No problem, Joe.

44:51.910 --> 44:54.283
-You got the place to yourself.
-We're Gandhi.

44:54.371 --> 44:58.665
I'll forget every horrible thing you've ever
done to me if you disappear tonight.

44:58.918 --> 45:00.994
-Just disappear.
-We're on the same team.

45:01.087 --> 45:02.747
Forget about it.

45:03.005 --> 45:04.548
I mean it.

45:06.008 --> 45:07.289
Thanks, Joe.

45:07.385 --> 45:09.543
Look at that piece of meat.

45:10.138 --> 45:12.381
That is some dope shit, Joe.

45:12.516 --> 45:14.258
Look at that, Joe!

45:27.696 --> 45:30.069
-That hit the spot.
-Complements to the chef.

45:30.158 --> 45:31.700
Joe's first date!

45:33.286 --> 45:35.195
Let's make it special.

45:35.454 --> 45:37.743
-Great idea, Ralph.
-Special, sure.

45:37.831 --> 45:38.993
I'm in favor.

45:44.923 --> 45:48.256
Come on, buddy, that's it.
Let's get him over the curb.

45:53.347 --> 45:54.427
Mr. Smith?

45:55.476 --> 45:57.515
It's a hostile takeover.

45:59.187 --> 46:02.556
Ten minutes ago this company became
a wholly-owned subsidiary...

46:02.649 --> 46:04.771
of Featherstone Feminine Products.

46:04.859 --> 46:08.310
They're going to shut down
the whole urinal cake division!

46:08.404 --> 46:10.232
Don't forget to take this.

46:10.323 --> 46:13.657
This way, gentlemen. Roll it over here.

46:17.038 --> 46:19.030
My whole life's work!

46:19.248 --> 46:20.743
Ruined!

46:21.251 --> 46:22.660
That's right.

46:22.751 --> 46:25.670
The days of trickle-down economics
are over.

47:18.183 --> 47:21.302
Ladies and gentlemen. It's loud, it's bad...

47:21.394 --> 47:23.553
it's Shit!

47:33.657 --> 47:35.068
Easy crowd.

47:39.454 --> 47:41.198
Oh, a new drummer.

47:43.333 --> 47:45.326
Yeah, I hope he's good.

47:45.460 --> 47:46.705
Hit it!

48:15.949 --> 48:17.657
I'm sorry!

48:18.118 --> 48:21.368
There won't be any rock-and-roll tonight.

48:21.538 --> 48:24.029
This is all that's left!

48:29.463 --> 48:32.499
This feeble wimped-out death rattle...

48:32.591 --> 48:35.675
is all that remains of the rolling thunder...

48:35.761 --> 48:37.752
of America's heartbeat!

48:58.785 --> 49:00.610
It wasn't that bad.

49:00.827 --> 49:02.322
Yes, it was.

49:04.414 --> 49:07.415
Maybe you should stick to banking,
after all.

49:08.418 --> 49:11.039
I'm not a banker. I'm not a drummer.

49:11.755 --> 49:15.005
I can't even keep a job
collecting urinal cakes.

49:15.175 --> 49:16.504
I'm just...

49:16.969 --> 49:18.083
nothing.

49:19.263 --> 49:21.255
I think you're something.

49:26.770 --> 49:30.056
-Why aren't you with your boyfriend?
-What boyfriend?

49:30.148 --> 49:33.600
The guy I saw you kiss in the garden
a few days ago.

49:35.737 --> 49:38.443
He's probably home kissing my mother.

49:40.283 --> 49:41.744
He's my dad.

49:47.833 --> 49:50.159
The lot is completely planted.

49:50.251 --> 49:53.586
The community is behind it,
the flowers are starting to bloom.

49:53.673 --> 49:55.914
Now I just have to show it to my father...

49:56.008 --> 49:59.127
and show him something good
can come out of the neighborhood...

49:59.219 --> 50:00.630
and it's worth saving.

50:00.721 --> 50:02.464
Do you want to come to my place?

50:06.268 --> 50:07.975
I've got a towel you could use.

50:31.126 --> 50:35.040
Funky towel
Towel's got the funk

50:35.839 --> 50:39.458
Funky towel
Towel's got the funk

50:45.223 --> 50:47.430
Baby, I got the love

50:47.518 --> 50:49.676
Baby, I got the power

50:49.770 --> 50:51.929
Come on, girl, and rock my world

50:52.023 --> 50:54.228
And my funky towel

51:06.287 --> 51:08.409
Baby, got the love

51:08.497 --> 51:10.490
Baby, got the howl

51:10.832 --> 51:13.040
Let's get down to party town

51:13.128 --> 51:15.251
And my funky towel

51:17.715 --> 51:21.546
Thick and funky
Steamin ' up the dance floor

51:22.511 --> 51:25.428
Get on up and shake that thing

51:27.141 --> 51:30.474
Everybody's gettin ' what they ask for

51:31.771 --> 51:34.937
Everybody, everybody, sing

51:36.358 --> 51:39.525
Sing, sing, sing

51:40.403 --> 51:43.358
Welcome to Joey's toilet

52:09.892 --> 52:11.600
-Make yourself at home.
-Thanks.

52:11.686 --> 52:13.263
I've got a towel....

52:23.239 --> 52:24.566
What are you doing?

52:24.656 --> 52:27.408
Having a party, what does it look like?

52:27.576 --> 52:29.735
I'm serious. I want you out of here!

52:29.829 --> 52:32.070
-Joe, my brother!
-Thanks, Joey!

52:32.164 --> 52:34.536
-What say there?
-Bust a move.

52:35.751 --> 52:37.828
Funky towel

52:37.921 --> 52:40.246
Towel's got the funk

52:41.424 --> 52:44.260
Okay, I'm dancing. Now, beat it. Leave.

52:53.727 --> 52:56.812
You just flushed the rhythm section
out to Coney lsland.

52:56.897 --> 52:59.306
So follow them out there. Lily's here.

52:59.400 --> 53:00.598
She is?

53:05.364 --> 53:07.772
My towels are in the laundry.

53:07.867 --> 53:09.526
Oh, that's fine.

53:30.015 --> 53:31.178
So...

53:31.724 --> 53:33.716
do you live here alone?

53:34.352 --> 53:36.511
Yep. Nobody here but us.

53:41.776 --> 53:43.568
Guys, you promised.

53:44.820 --> 53:47.525
Come on, baby, light my fire.

53:50.201 --> 53:52.573
-Up periscope.
-Music, maestro.

54:02.672 --> 54:04.748
How about a smooch, baby?

54:11.514 --> 54:13.388
Your place is so comfy.

54:14.101 --> 54:15.180
Shut up.

54:16.852 --> 54:18.263
I mean...

54:19.689 --> 54:20.851
drink up.

54:22.650 --> 54:24.559
Down the hatch, sweetie.

54:25.403 --> 54:27.976
Here's to life's little surprises.

54:35.121 --> 54:37.873
I think you'll need one of these, Joe.

54:42.377 --> 54:43.789
Pretzel nugget?

54:45.507 --> 54:47.084
Bon appetit.

54:51.471 --> 54:53.049
What a lover!

54:53.181 --> 54:54.675
A real Casanova.

54:55.183 --> 54:56.381
Go get her.

54:57.018 --> 54:58.811
I beg your pardon?

54:59.272 --> 55:00.765
Feeling better?

55:01.231 --> 55:02.511
Well, I'm...

55:03.066 --> 55:04.773
still a little wet.

55:09.572 --> 55:11.861
-What's going on?
-Don't push.

55:12.617 --> 55:14.824
I'm sorry. I hope you don't catch cold.

55:14.911 --> 55:16.951
-She wants it.
-I smell victory.

55:17.163 --> 55:19.156
At least it wasn't a downpour.

55:21.752 --> 55:23.245
Steady there!

55:27.548 --> 55:29.458
-Steady!
-Don't tip it!

55:36.892 --> 55:38.718
Let me out of here!

55:42.313 --> 55:43.809
No, no! Wait!

55:44.817 --> 55:46.395
Oh, my God!

55:48.027 --> 55:49.652
Lily, come back!

55:56.536 --> 55:58.576
Oh, my God.

56:01.291 --> 56:02.571
My garden.

56:08.173 --> 56:09.798
My father was right.

56:11.467 --> 56:14.172
This place does deserve to be a prison.

56:15.472 --> 56:17.963
The East Village sucks!

56:27.442 --> 56:29.519
We're really sorry, man.

56:29.612 --> 56:31.486
-We're sorry.
-We didn't mean it.

56:31.573 --> 56:33.231
Tough break, buddy.

56:33.323 --> 56:34.568
We didn't know.

56:34.658 --> 56:37.231
Beer, Joe? Oh, sorry.

56:37.327 --> 56:39.153
She'll never speak to me again.

56:39.245 --> 56:41.452
Come on. There'll be others, Joe.

56:41.540 --> 56:43.995
I don't want any others. I want Lily.

56:44.459 --> 56:45.622
I want to die.

56:45.711 --> 56:47.418
Look on the bright side.

56:47.879 --> 56:49.623
You always got us.

56:52.092 --> 56:53.468
All right.

56:53.594 --> 56:54.969
That's it.

56:55.469 --> 56:58.719
I'm getting rid of you roaches
once and for all.

56:59.141 --> 57:00.469
Wait. Don't be rash.

57:00.559 --> 57:02.966
I'll kill every last one of you!

57:03.103 --> 57:04.680
We're family!

57:04.771 --> 57:06.930
Well, I guess this means war.

57:09.067 --> 57:10.478
Joe, let's talk.

57:10.569 --> 57:13.060
This is all I have to say to you, Ralph.

57:14.741 --> 57:17.445
-He's got a bomb!
-Run for your lives!

57:17.993 --> 57:19.784
No! Don't do it!

57:29.880 --> 57:32.205
My babies! My babies!

57:32.299 --> 57:34.421
One, two, three, heave!

57:35.677 --> 57:36.673
Heave!

57:48.857 --> 57:51.645
Careful, soldier, don't lose your head.

57:52.152 --> 57:54.643
Oh, Joe's little dolly got hurt.

57:57.991 --> 57:59.569
Red alert!

58:08.710 --> 58:10.786
Armored force, attack!

58:15.133 --> 58:16.544
Let her go!

58:18.011 --> 58:19.671
Timber!

58:33.569 --> 58:36.024
-What the....
-Hello, Joe.

58:36.112 --> 58:37.690
Now can we talk?

58:38.282 --> 58:40.855
-You go first.
-No, you go first.

58:42.495 --> 58:44.368
Goddamn, you little sons of bitches!

58:44.454 --> 58:46.614
Get the hell out of my apartment!

58:46.708 --> 58:48.202
Listen to that.

58:48.293 --> 58:50.663
-Your apartment?
-I believe we were here first.

58:50.752 --> 58:54.039
We'll be here last, too.
We got a long-term lease on this planet.

58:54.131 --> 58:59.006
Roaches will be crawling on the daisy
popping out of the last rotting human.

58:59.553 --> 59:00.964
God, you're disgusting!

59:01.055 --> 59:04.091
Like you humans
are any kind of fucking prize!

59:04.183 --> 59:06.341
What makes you so much better than us?

59:06.435 --> 59:09.851
War, pollution, New Age music!

59:10.230 --> 59:12.934
I suppose those things are our fault?

59:18.823 --> 59:20.862
We just want to say two things. First:

59:20.949 --> 59:23.073
We're sorry we ruined your life. Second:

59:23.161 --> 59:24.274
Goodbye.

59:24.369 --> 59:25.864
-Toodles.
-Sayonara.

59:25.955 --> 59:27.781
What do you mean "goodbye"?

59:27.873 --> 59:32.002
-We took a big risk talking to you.
-Since you faked our friendship...

59:32.087 --> 59:34.956
you can't walk off
knowing what you know.

59:37.133 --> 59:39.041
Painful decision, Joe.

59:39.718 --> 59:40.881
Wait!

59:44.056 --> 59:46.095
Here, roachy, roachy.

59:47.727 --> 59:49.304
Going to miss you.

59:50.270 --> 59:52.014
I was kidding.

59:52.148 --> 59:55.268
-Any last words?
-Don't kill me.

59:55.526 --> 59:57.067
Those are the last words?

59:57.151 --> 59:59.061
Ready! Aim!

01:00:06.913 --> 01:00:08.739
Ralph! Rodney!

01:00:09.999 --> 01:00:11.243
Help!

01:01:33.917 --> 01:01:35.909
Big deal. Please hold.

01:01:36.878 --> 01:01:38.704
So what? Please hold.

01:01:39.338 --> 01:01:41.794
Don't make me laugh. Please hold.

01:01:43.593 --> 01:01:45.087
No, ma'am.

01:01:45.178 --> 01:01:49.046
I think you should take the shrapnel out
before you cauterize.

01:01:49.141 --> 01:01:52.011
-I don 't think I can do it.
-Please hold.

01:01:53.519 --> 01:01:55.559
Central Complaint Department.

01:01:55.647 --> 01:01:58.316
I'd like to speak to Lily Dougherty.

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:02.478
Lily's not here.

01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:04.523
Will she be back soon?

01:02:04.613 --> 01:02:06.939
No. She's sick.

01:02:07.033 --> 01:02:08.112
Sick?

01:02:10.078 --> 01:02:11.986
She's sick of her job.

01:02:12.245 --> 01:02:13.954
And she's sick of New York City.

01:02:14.039 --> 01:02:18.038
And she's sick of having her stupid
daydreams dashed to pieces.

01:02:19.253 --> 01:02:20.831
And what makes her sickest...

01:02:20.922 --> 01:02:24.172
is the unspeakably rotten things
some people do to other people...

01:02:24.258 --> 01:02:26.381
just when she was beginning to like them!

01:02:26.469 --> 01:02:27.963
Lily, is that you?

01:02:29.014 --> 01:02:30.092
No.

01:02:30.431 --> 01:02:31.808
Lily quit.

01:02:31.892 --> 01:02:33.434
Lily, it's Joe!

01:02:33.518 --> 01:02:34.598
Lily!

01:03:16.019 --> 01:03:17.182
Ralph!

01:03:19.106 --> 01:03:20.137
Rodney!

01:03:22.025 --> 01:03:24.729
I don't care
if you can hear me or not, Ralph!

01:03:24.986 --> 01:03:27.608
But you can keep this goddamn city!

01:03:28.155 --> 01:03:30.826
I'm going back to lowa!

01:03:31.368 --> 01:03:33.989
Here's a souvenir to take with you.

01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:37.622
So long, sucker.

01:03:37.916 --> 01:03:39.991
I love the real estate business.

01:03:48.426 --> 01:03:50.465
The place looks great.

01:03:50.553 --> 01:03:52.345
Sure it does, Ralph. Where's Joe?

01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:54.553
Around here someplace, I suppose.

01:03:57.685 --> 01:03:58.800
Joe!

01:04:00.606 --> 01:04:02.515
Joe, speak to me!

01:04:02.608 --> 01:04:04.186
Who did this to you?

01:04:04.277 --> 01:04:08.273
We did, Ralph. We ran out on him
just when he needed us most.

01:04:09.113 --> 01:04:11.403
We behaved no better
than a bunch of people.

01:04:11.491 --> 01:04:14.695
We got to make it up to him.
Let's find him a new place.

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.779
We got to get Lily back, too.

01:04:18.707 --> 01:04:21.198
Forget that, I'm a cockroach,
not Santa Claus.

01:04:21.293 --> 01:04:25.207
Ralphie, I'm surprised at you.
Does this mean you're giving up?

01:04:25.297 --> 01:04:28.581
Give up? Give up?
What are you saying to me?

01:04:29.133 --> 01:04:32.135
How come us roaches have been able
to outlast the dinosaurs?

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:35.055
How do we survive poison
and persecution?

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:38.176
How do we keep on crawling
in the face of the world in arms?

01:04:38.268 --> 01:04:39.299
How?

01:04:39.394 --> 01:04:42.430
I'll tell you how.
Because we never give up!

01:04:44.483 --> 01:04:46.309
A true cockroach never gives up!

01:04:46.401 --> 01:04:50.186
They can stomp us, they can pop us,
but they'll never ever stop us!

01:04:52.407 --> 01:04:57.484
Some day, the great H-bomb will drop,
and we'll have the planet to ourselves!

01:05:00.415 --> 01:05:04.627
I don't care if we call in favors from
every roach, rat and pigeon in New York.

01:05:04.711 --> 01:05:06.834
We aren't giving up on Joe!

01:05:06.921 --> 01:05:09.413
-Great speech, Ralph!
-Truly righteous, brother.

01:05:21.895 --> 01:05:23.389
Where's the stapler?

01:05:27.234 --> 01:05:30.270
-I need five copies.
-How do you spell "memorandum"?

01:05:34.242 --> 01:05:35.440
Boot it up.

01:05:37.035 --> 01:05:38.945
Anybody got a 1942 W-440?

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.051
Special delivery.

01:06:01.725 --> 01:06:03.969
This is giving me hay fever.

01:06:06.022 --> 01:06:08.395
Hey, watch the potholes, homes.

01:06:14.323 --> 01:06:17.110
Excuse me, sir. Mind if we borrow this?

01:06:58.283 --> 01:06:59.564
Tubular!

01:07:01.328 --> 01:07:02.491
Wash out!

01:07:02.831 --> 01:07:04.989
Sewer surfing

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.657
Under-turfing

01:07:08.168 --> 01:07:10.457
We get our kicks while we're hanging six

01:07:10.546 --> 01:07:13.119
On a sewer surfing holiday

01:07:29.396 --> 01:07:31.971
We're surfing, we're sewer surfing

01:07:43.079 --> 01:07:45.450
Shoo-shoo
Shooting the tube

01:07:45.706 --> 01:07:48.458
We are going to get there
Shooting the tube

01:07:48.543 --> 01:07:50.831
Hitting the loo
We're dirtier than you

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.996
We are shooting the tube

01:08:26.913 --> 01:08:29.072
Are you sure this is the right address?

01:08:29.166 --> 01:08:30.281
Yes, Daddy.

01:08:30.376 --> 01:08:32.701
"324 1/2 East 8th Street.

01:08:32.795 --> 01:08:34.917
"Prison dedication, 9:00 a.m."

01:08:35.423 --> 01:08:38.589
Funny, I could have sworn
this was an empty lot.

01:09:32.772 --> 01:09:34.432
-Hi, Lily.
-Joe!

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:36.393
What's all this?

01:09:36.484 --> 01:09:38.192
I guess it's sort of...

01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:40.482
mine.

01:09:42.113 --> 01:09:44.189
And I'm giving it to you.

01:09:45.951 --> 01:09:47.410
Is it okay?

01:09:47.743 --> 01:09:49.987
It's wonderful, but how did you....

01:09:50.081 --> 01:09:52.916
My friends helped.

01:09:55.294 --> 01:09:56.492
I see.

01:09:58.714 --> 01:10:00.588
Lily, you were right.

01:10:00.758 --> 01:10:04.258
This park will do more for
the Lower East Side than 1,000 prisons.

01:10:04.346 --> 01:10:07.761
My boy, you've done my old neighborhood
a great service.

01:10:08.057 --> 01:10:10.346
It was all her idea, Senator.

01:10:13.687 --> 01:10:14.802
Come on.

01:10:18.401 --> 01:10:20.026
My friends...

01:10:20.195 --> 01:10:22.353
this extraordinary garden...

01:10:22.572 --> 01:10:26.023
is the first blossom
of this neighborhood's rebirth.

01:10:26.117 --> 01:10:27.528
What is this?

01:10:30.662 --> 01:10:34.827
Kill that lying,
two-timing Senator Dougherty. Tonight.

01:10:36.127 --> 01:10:39.661
Whack his daughter
and that damn kid, too.

01:10:41.007 --> 01:10:43.129
See all these people here?

01:10:43.634 --> 01:10:45.960
Dead by the end of the week.

01:10:48.933 --> 01:10:50.592
And that little girl over there--

01:10:50.684 --> 01:10:52.095
Mr. Shirt!

01:10:54.812 --> 01:10:57.385
Let me show you a hot new property.

01:11:06.574 --> 01:11:10.157
Welcome to Lily Park!

01:11:21.756 --> 01:11:24.128
There's an extra toothbrush
in the cupboard.

01:11:24.217 --> 01:11:25.711
Oh, really, don't bother.

01:11:25.802 --> 01:11:29.337
It's the least I could do.
Your house burned down.

01:11:30.139 --> 01:11:32.049
I'll set you up on the couch.

01:11:35.145 --> 01:11:37.897
Joe, you're practically inside.

01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:39.143
Ralph!

01:11:39.232 --> 01:11:41.687
-Little last minute advice.
-Get lost, Ralph!

01:11:41.776 --> 01:11:43.816
Look into her eyes and say:

01:11:43.904 --> 01:11:46.904
"Baby, I'm going to bop you
till your ears bleed! "

01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:48.947
Did you need something?

01:11:49.534 --> 01:11:50.649
No, thanks.

01:11:50.744 --> 01:11:54.077
Play your cards right, Joe,
and this could be our new pad.

01:11:54.164 --> 01:11:56.120
"Our new pad"? You little....

01:11:56.833 --> 01:11:59.999
We busted ass for you!
What kind of thanks do we get?

01:12:02.921 --> 01:12:04.036
Ralph...

01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:06.248
thanks.

01:12:07.093 --> 01:12:08.753
For everything.

01:12:09.262 --> 01:12:13.260
Forget it. Sorry about our little
misunderstanding back there.

01:12:13.849 --> 01:12:16.685
Me, too. Now, how about a little privacy?

01:12:17.104 --> 01:12:19.809
Take my advice, just grab her by--

01:12:29.824 --> 01:12:32.231
Gosh, Lily, you look incredible.

01:12:32.744 --> 01:12:35.744
-How about a little help here?
-No. I mean it.

01:12:37.832 --> 01:12:41.118
You're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen in my life.

01:12:42.003 --> 01:12:45.752
I bet you say that to all the girls
the minute you get them alone.

01:12:47.049 --> 01:12:48.792
We are alone, aren't we?

01:12:50.845 --> 01:12:52.126
Last I looked.

01:12:52.222 --> 01:12:55.258
Oh, please, let me.
I can make the bed myself.

01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:58.137
Really? Have you ever made a bed
in your life?

01:12:58.603 --> 01:13:00.311
Sure, watch this.

01:13:02.983 --> 01:13:05.735
Swinging pad!
What do you think, Rodney?

01:13:06.654 --> 01:13:07.899
Brother Ralph...

01:13:07.989 --> 01:13:11.986
I believe that we have finally reached
the promised penthouse!

01:13:12.659 --> 01:13:15.329
Brother bugs and sister insects!

01:13:15.412 --> 01:13:17.203
Come on with it, Rodney!

01:13:17.288 --> 01:13:20.075
Give a shout out to the Great Big Bug.

01:13:21.001 --> 01:13:24.583
With his help,
we can turn this antiseptic sanctuary...

01:13:24.671 --> 01:13:26.664
into a putrid paradise!

01:13:27.674 --> 01:13:30.959
Hold my feeler, Lord
Lord, pull me through

01:13:31.052 --> 01:13:32.166
Pull me through

01:13:32.261 --> 01:13:36.212
Hold my feeler, Lord
Lord, pull me through

01:13:36.767 --> 01:13:41.180
Hold my feeler, Lord
Lord, till I join that golden horde

01:13:41.271 --> 01:13:43.264
I'll be hanging

01:13:44.107 --> 01:13:46.100
Hanging onto you

01:13:51.324 --> 01:13:54.158
Lily, now that we're alone,
I should tell you...

01:13:54.242 --> 01:13:56.567
I'm sorry about what happened
at my apartment.

01:13:56.661 --> 01:13:58.619
My friends are sorry, too.

01:13:58.705 --> 01:13:59.985
Friends?

01:14:00.498 --> 01:14:04.163
I never thought I'd say this,
but they're actually kind of sweet.

01:14:04.377 --> 01:14:06.169
They must like you a lot.

01:14:07.297 --> 01:14:09.171
Not as much as I like you.

01:14:12.344 --> 01:14:13.625
Go, Joe!

01:14:13.721 --> 01:14:16.839
We've been battered
And we've been scattered

01:14:17.223 --> 01:14:20.010
We've been splattered into goo

01:14:20.728 --> 01:14:24.179
-But the healer, he took my feeler
-Praise the Lord, hallelujah!

01:14:24.273 --> 01:14:27.024
And he really pulled me through

01:14:27.109 --> 01:14:31.272
-Oh, he pulled me through
-Oh, that feeler

01:14:34.408 --> 01:14:38.109
When I cash my chips and pay the dealer

01:14:38.371 --> 01:14:41.537
I'll be holding onto the Lord's feeler, too

01:14:42.332 --> 01:14:45.499
Hold my feeler

01:14:45.627 --> 01:14:47.666
And my antenna, too

01:14:48.714 --> 01:14:52.213
I've been down and I've been trampled

01:14:52.301 --> 01:14:55.586
And dug myself down deep in a hole

01:14:55.804 --> 01:14:57.464
But I was lifted

01:14:57.598 --> 01:14:59.507
By the love of that Great Big Bug

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.765
With his feelers 'round my soul

01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:04.259
Whoa, Lord

01:15:04.354 --> 01:15:06.311
Won 't you hold my feeler?

01:15:06.398 --> 01:15:09.067
Hold my feeler and pull me through

01:15:09.150 --> 01:15:11.025
I want you to feel my feeler!

01:15:11.111 --> 01:15:15.655
My Lord, there 's nothing realer

01:15:20.955 --> 01:15:22.699
Joe, that tickles.

01:15:24.833 --> 01:15:31.037
Than my ever-loving feeler feeling you

01:15:40.641 --> 01:15:43.926
So! So long from Joe's apartment

01:15:44.019 --> 01:15:47.102
We're sad to see you go

01:15:47.188 --> 01:15:49.726
Thanks for coming, it's been swell

01:15:49.815 --> 01:15:52.438
Check back into our motel

01:15:52.528 --> 01:15:56.111
Hope you didn 't mind the smell

01:15:56.489 --> 01:15:58.114
Joe's apartment

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:04.404
our own sweet home

01:16:05.305 --> 01:16:11.787
