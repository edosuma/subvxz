00:01.067 --> 00:03.028
Hello, I am Leslie Knope,
and I am here

00:03.108 --> 00:04.949
to interview for
the Deputy Parks Director job.

00:04.974 --> 00:06.791
Leslie, this is ridiculous.

00:06.911 --> 00:08.345
It's your job.
Take it.

00:08.379 --> 00:09.512
Well, I should have
to interview

00:09.547 --> 00:10.947
- just like everyone else.
- Mm.

00:10.982 --> 00:12.782
Now, if you'll see
on my resume,

00:12.817 --> 00:15.385
I held the position
of deputy director

00:15.419 --> 00:17.053
of parks and recreation
for almost ten years.

00:17.088 --> 00:18.955
I know.
I was your boss.

00:18.990 --> 00:21.157
I also walked you down the aisle
at your wedding.

00:21.192 --> 00:22.492
Take the job
and leave me alone.

00:22.527 --> 00:24.127
Come on, Ron.
Just interview me.

00:24.161 --> 00:27.097
- No special treatment.
- Okay, fine.

00:27.131 --> 00:28.291
What do you believe should be

00:28.299 --> 00:29.866
the ultimate goal
of this department?

00:29.901 --> 00:31.902
The ancient Greek version
of the park

00:31.936 --> 00:34.237
was the agora,
a gathering place

00:34.272 --> 00:35.972
where people
from all walks of life--

00:36.007 --> 00:37.774
What are you writing?
Is it good?

00:37.808 --> 00:40.343
What do you think is the best
use of our yearly budget?

00:40.378 --> 00:42.112
It's right there in the name:

00:42.146 --> 00:43.613
Maintaining our beautiful parks

00:43.648 --> 00:46.550
and providing healthy
outdoor recreation.

00:46.584 --> 00:48.618
I'm sorry, Ms. Knope,
the correct answer is

00:48.653 --> 00:50.987
"Give it all back
to the taxpayers."

00:51.022 --> 00:52.022
It seems you and I have

00:52.056 --> 00:53.590
fundamentally different
philosophies.

00:53.624 --> 00:55.892
Frankly, it's a miracle
we ever worked together

00:55.927 --> 00:57.194
without killing each other.

00:57.228 --> 00:58.595
- Good day.
- Ha, ha, okay.

00:58.629 --> 01:00.363
No more goofing around.
Just tell me I have the job.

01:00.398 --> 01:01.631
I have a lot of other people
to meet with.

01:01.666 --> 01:04.233
- I'll be in touch.
- Ron, come on, it's me.

01:04.268 --> 01:06.403
Give me special treatment.

Okay, first morning meeting

01:29.360 --> 01:30.794
back in the old
conference room.

01:30.828 --> 01:31.632
What's this?

01:31.752 --> 01:33.496
Oh, it shows everyone's
spirit dogs.

01:33.531 --> 01:34.497
- That one's you.
- You guys think

01:34.532 --> 01:35.632
I'm a border collie?

01:35.666 --> 01:37.801
So obviously a cocker spaniel.

01:37.835 --> 01:40.103
The spirit dog committee
ruled on that weeks ago.

01:40.137 --> 01:42.105
- There is no appeals process.
- No.

01:42.139 --> 01:43.740
[Laughter]

01:43.774 --> 01:44.934
Totally.
I'm in on the joke.

01:44.942 --> 01:47.143
I get it, but maybe
we should stop talking

01:47.178 --> 01:49.446
about your insane dog choices
and get to working.

01:49.480 --> 01:52.115
Classic border collie.
Has to control everything.

01:52.149 --> 01:53.183
[Laughter]

01:53.217 --> 01:55.585
Totally.
[Laughs]

01:55.620 --> 01:57.187
First on the agenda:
I'm gonna bring

01:57.221 --> 02:00.357
my lemonade stand idea
to the small business coalition,

02:00.391 --> 02:02.125
and a little birdie told me
it's already in the bag.

02:02.159 --> 02:03.493
- Can I get a what-what?
- What?

02:03.528 --> 02:04.494
- What?
- Thank you.

02:04.529 --> 02:05.662
No.
What idea?

02:05.696 --> 02:07.764
The fella who runs
the hot stew stand

02:07.798 --> 02:09.566
in Lafayette Park is retiring,

02:09.600 --> 02:12.836
so Pawnee's new
business liaison--Tom--

02:12.870 --> 02:15.071
went out and got the Indiana
Brothers juice company

02:15.106 --> 02:16.406
to rent it out
as a lemonade stand.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.474
Wow.

02:17.508 --> 02:18.675
[Pop, fizz]

02:18.709 --> 02:20.277
Plus, I downloaded
this dope app

02:20.311 --> 02:22.045
that pops champagne whenever
I say something awesome.

02:22.079 --> 02:23.413
- Tom, that's great.
- I know.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.782
- And it was only 9 bucks.
- No, I mean, the lemonade--

02:25.816 --> 02:27.684
never mind.
Well, I will start doing

02:27.718 --> 02:29.319
an environmental impact study,
and Ron,

02:29.353 --> 02:30.654
you can do some
demographic research.

02:30.688 --> 02:31.855
Don't sweat it, Lez-kno.

02:31.889 --> 02:34.391
Tommy's taking care
of every last detail.

02:34.425 --> 02:36.026
Nothing I can do to help?

02:36.060 --> 02:38.195
Okay.
[Clears throat]

02:38.229 --> 02:39.996
Oh.

02:40.031 --> 02:42.532
I can straighten this for you.
[Laughs]

02:42.567 --> 02:46.736
There we go.

02:46.771 --> 02:48.038
Oh, Larry.

02:48.072 --> 02:50.207
We've been taking pictures
all over City Hall

02:50.241 --> 02:52.442
to show our unborn baby
where we met.

02:52.477 --> 02:53.677
- Would you mind?
- Oh, my gosh.

02:53.711 --> 02:55.212
I would be honored.
[Chuckles]

02:55.246 --> 02:58.381
Say, when are you crazy kids
gonna get hitched?

02:58.416 --> 02:59.449
Well, you know, actually,
we haven't

02:59.483 --> 03:00.550
discussed it in a while.

03:00.585 --> 03:01.985
No, it's kind of taken
a back seat.

03:02.019 --> 03:03.353
Well, you know,
to each his own,

03:03.387 --> 03:05.622
but you guys really seem
like you're in love.

03:05.656 --> 03:08.625
And when I see a couple
who look at each other

03:08.659 --> 03:10.427
the way you do,

03:10.461 --> 03:11.795
I don't know,
it just makes me think

03:11.829 --> 03:14.731
that maybe this crazy world
is gonna be okay.

03:14.765 --> 03:15.699
[Laughs]

03:15.733 --> 03:17.734
That literally went on forever.

03:17.769 --> 03:19.970
I thought you were never
gonna stop talking.

03:20.004 --> 03:22.439
But now that you have...

03:22.473 --> 03:24.741
Ann Perkins, will you marry me?

03:24.775 --> 03:26.276

03:27.411 --> 03:28.345

03:30.248 --> 03:32.782
Uh, I mean, yes, of--
of course, l-let's do it.

03:32.817 --> 03:34.150
Can I have a sip
of your water, please?

03:34.185 --> 03:36.052
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm--I'm a bit of a germaphobe.

03:36.087 --> 03:38.054
Oh, no, no, totally understand.

03:38.089 --> 03:39.356
[Coughs]
Ann Perkins...

03:39.390 --> 03:40.957
I'm gonna cough it out.
[Coughs]

03:40.992 --> 03:43.894
I would like to spend
the rest of my life with you.

03:43.928 --> 03:45.629
I love you.
[Larry groaning]

03:45.663 --> 03:49.432
I love you too.
[Larry hacking]

03:49.467 --> 03:51.067
No part of this
is how I pictured it.

03:51.102 --> 03:53.003
I thought another cracker
might push it through,

03:53.037 --> 03:54.671
but I was wrong.

03:54.705 --> 03:56.072
- Let's do this right.
- Yeah.

03:56.107 --> 03:57.040
Let's go get
an engagement ring.

03:57.074 --> 03:59.276
Yes.

- Hello, France!
- Mm.

04:07.051 --> 04:08.291
You guys enjoying that cheese?

04:08.319 --> 04:09.586
It's unpasteurized.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.188
[Groans] What's that mean?

04:11.222 --> 04:13.423
- Unpasteurized?
- I don't care. I don't care.

04:13.457 --> 04:16.226
Technically, it's illegal
in this country.

04:16.260 --> 04:18.028
I smuggled it back from Paris.

04:18.062 --> 04:19.495
Anyway, I want you guys

04:19.529 --> 04:22.031
to think of my office
as a clubhouse,

04:22.065 --> 04:24.301
total open-door policy.

04:24.335 --> 04:26.036
I wanna be your friend

04:26.070 --> 04:27.370
as well as your boss.

04:27.405 --> 04:29.039
What the hell
is wrong with you?

04:29.073 --> 04:31.007
Are you in a cult?
Can I join?

04:31.042 --> 04:33.543
- Let's sacrifice Larry.
- [Laughs] Oh, April.

04:33.578 --> 04:35.212
It's my first day
as city manager,

04:35.246 --> 04:37.180
so I'm holding
open office hours

04:37.215 --> 04:38.748
to break the ice.

04:38.783 --> 04:40.417
Now, Chris was always
the nice guy

04:40.451 --> 04:43.286
that made everyone happy,
while I brought down the hammer.

04:43.321 --> 04:46.923
But now that he's gone,
I kind of have to do both.

04:46.958 --> 04:49.593

We're cutting vacation time.

I have some super cool
new rules...

- Oh, nice.
- That are also super mandatory.

05:13.117 --> 05:15.819
No cell phone usage
on City Hall property?

05:15.853 --> 05:18.188
That's not fair, my cell phone
is how I avoid doing work.

05:18.222 --> 05:21.124
Bathroom breaks should be
limited to five minutes?

probably just rip it.

to get married today.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.840
We haven't told our families

07:53.874 --> 07:55.875
or chosen a venue,

07:55.909 --> 07:57.777
but it's not a shotgun wedding.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.345
We've been planning ours
for months.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.047
You wouldn't believe how much
there is to do.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.715
Invitations, table settings,

08:02.749 --> 08:04.417
color scheme, dance lessons.

08:04.451 --> 08:05.484
And that's just
for the rehearsal dinner.

08:05.519 --> 08:06.752
[Both laugh]
Oh.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.854
Seriously, that's just
for the rehearsal dinner.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.023
That sounds elaborate.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.925
All we did was punch
"jewelry store"

08:12.960 --> 08:14.293
into our car GPS.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.495
You remember
that romantic moment, Chris?

08:16.530 --> 08:18.297
I was getting gas.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.066
No, I don't remember it.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.470
Hey, Tom, I don't mean
to bug you or anything,

08:24.505 --> 08:27.073
but I notice that my super
system binder is closed.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.274
Just checking
that you had a chance

08:28.308 --> 08:30.309
to refamiliarize yourself
entirely.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.078
Yeah, flipped through it.
Looks good.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.779
Huh.
You're lying.

08:33.813 --> 08:36.982
I placed a single strand
of hair along the edge,

08:37.017 --> 08:38.583
and that secret strand
is unbroken.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.119
Whose hair is that?
It's brown.

08:40.154 --> 08:41.453
Look, it seems
like you don't even care

08:41.488 --> 08:42.755
about your presentation.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.457
<i>Au contraire.</i>
<i>I'm working on it right now.</i>

08:44.491 --> 08:46.425
And what's the most important
part of a presentation?

08:46.460 --> 08:47.693
- Content.
- The presentation.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.595
Okay.
Tom, you need hard data.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.930
You need facts
to make your case.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.298
And then you need
two funny quotes

08:52.332 --> 08:53.499
and an inspirational one.

08:53.534 --> 08:56.035
You know, a classic
ha-ha-hmm.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.203
Look, I think you need
to take a page

08:57.237 --> 08:59.639
out of my system
and chill out a bit, okay?

08:59.673 --> 09:01.240
I got this.

09:01.275 --> 09:02.775
Okay, fine, I trust you.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.744
But I think you're gonna fail,
and you're a ticking time bomb.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.112
- What's that?
- Nothing, good luck.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.813
- This is an elk hair.
- Yes.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.482
It's the most effective hair
for binder security.

09:09.516 --> 09:10.483
You know that, Ron.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.051
If Tom gives that presentation,

09:12.085 --> 09:13.753
it is going to be
a total disaster

09:13.787 --> 09:16.155
for both him
and the department.

09:16.190 --> 09:17.890
I cannot sit idly by

09:17.925 --> 09:19.859
and watch
this terrible thing happen.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.394
I mean, I can barely
sit idly by

09:21.428 --> 09:22.762
and watch good things happen.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.330
We've got a couple
of customs agents

09:24.364 --> 09:26.365
coming down from the border,
and they are not happy.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.201
I can't believe this.
I never break the law.

09:28.202 --> 09:30.036
- I've never even jaywalked.
- Never?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.772
I mean, I-I-I--
everyone does it sometimes.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.640
Just add that to the charges.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.410
Well, well, well,
we got a hit on your prints.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.645
Seems you're wanted
for tax fraud in Colorado?

09:39.680 --> 09:40.813
What?

09:40.847 --> 09:42.548
I've never even been
to Colorado.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.183
I mean, I had a layover
in Denver once.

09:44.218 --> 09:46.152
Man, you can't keep
your story straight, can you?

09:46.186 --> 09:47.186
- Come on!
- Oh.

09:47.221 --> 09:48.588
Here comes
the customs guys now.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.223
Fellas, he's all yours.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.292
[Overlapping shouting]
You're pranked.

09:53.327 --> 09:54.660
You gotta see the stupid look
on your face.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.062
Check this out.
I took a picture.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.331
- Classic!
- You seemed a little uptight.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.767
Thought we'd have some fun
with our new boss.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.569
Wow.
Thi--you got me.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.338
Good one, makin' me think
I was gonna like

10:05.372 --> 10:06.405
die in federal prison...

10:06.440 --> 10:07.773
Ah, that's super funny,

10:07.808 --> 10:10.343
you scamps.
[Donna tittering]

10:11.461 --> 10:13.622
Now, Stu, I know that you're
thinking about retiring,

10:13.647 --> 10:15.248
and I am here
to ask you to reconsider.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.282
What do you say?

10:16.316 --> 10:18.584
Keep that Lafayette Park
stand open,

10:18.619 --> 10:20.353
pumpin' out the stew
like you do.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.088
I don't know.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.457
I'm looking forward to spending
time with my wife,

10:24.491 --> 10:26.292
working on some new hobbies.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.361
I was thinking about getting
into bisques.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.496
Stu, you have been a staple

10:30.531 --> 10:32.865
in the parks department system
for years.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.835
Retirement is for the birds.
You're gonna be so bored.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.804
I'm gonna say this
because you need to hear it.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.073
Screw bisque.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.675
- That makes a lot of sense.
- Yeah.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.744
What now?
What do I do?

10:44.778 --> 10:46.612
Well, we're gonna need
to convince the business council

10:46.647 --> 10:49.015
to keep you around, but that's
not for you to worry about.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.683
I'll take care of it.
You just keep on

10:50.717 --> 10:51.684
stewin' what you stew.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.453
Thanks, Leslie.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.154
This calls for a toast.

10:55.189 --> 10:56.322
[Buzz]

10:56.356 --> 10:59.859
Susan?
Stew flutes, please.

10:59.893 --> 11:00.927
Ah.

11:02.729 --> 11:05.131
To stew.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.000
Mm.
Oh, my God.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.236
- That's very hot.
- Mm-hmm.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.704
Congratulations.
This is a beauty.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.573
If you like,
I could engrave the date

11:13.607 --> 11:15.041
on the inside of the band.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.409
That may be tough,

11:16.443 --> 11:18.211
'cause we actually
haven't discussed it yet.

11:18.245 --> 11:21.180
We could engrave "2014"

11:21.215 --> 11:24.016
- or "TBD."
- Hang on.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.152
If neither of us has ever
thought about this stuff,

11:26.186 --> 11:27.920
then maybe there's a reason.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.922
When you think about it,
we are already

11:29.957 --> 11:31.858
more married
than most married people.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.759
Right? I mean,
we're having a child together.

11:33.794 --> 11:34.961
We're moving to a new city.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.596
You let me pee
with the door open

11:36.630 --> 11:38.197
so I could watch the end of
<i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>

11:38.232 --> 11:40.700
That was a fantastic
season finale

11:40.734 --> 11:42.602
and a show that is literally

11:42.636 --> 11:44.270
a never-ending roller coaster
of emotion.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.439
I mean, why spend
thousands of dollars

11:46.473 --> 11:48.241
just to reaffirm
what we already know,

11:48.275 --> 11:49.976
which is that
we love each other?

11:50.010 --> 11:53.145
That is so beautiful.

11:53.180 --> 11:56.282
Theodore, we would like
to return that ring.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.650
And get a refund, please.

11:57.684 --> 11:58.951
Maybe we should
talk this over too.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.686
- Oh, come on.
- Think what we could do

12:00.721 --> 12:01.821
if we didn't buy this ring.

12:01.855 --> 12:05.258
I mean, this could go
towards buying a house.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.859
You have a lovely store.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.661
- Hey, boss?
- Hey.

12:08.695 --> 12:11.797
I was just printing out
my minesweeper high score,

12:11.832 --> 12:13.266
and I noticed this memo.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.268
You're punishing us
for the prank?

12:15.302 --> 12:16.602
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:16.637 --> 12:18.504
It's just like a warning memo.

12:18.539 --> 12:20.139
Like, "Hey, all in good fun,

12:20.173 --> 12:21.774
"but I'm your boss,
and if you do it again,

12:21.808 --> 12:23.109
you're suspended."

12:23.143 --> 12:25.111
- That kind of thing.
- Listen.

12:25.145 --> 12:29.015
I know that you're the governor
or whatever,

12:29.049 --> 12:30.783
and I'm just government junior.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.618
- What?
- I feel like you're blowing it.

12:32.653 --> 12:33.786
If you want people to like you,

12:33.821 --> 12:35.121
you have to play along.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.356
Don't punish Donna and April.

12:37.391 --> 12:38.524
Prank them back.

12:38.559 --> 12:40.560
I guess I could stand
to loosen up a little,

12:40.594 --> 12:43.162
but I don't know
how to pull a prank.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.031
Dude, okay.
Well, I could help you.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.466
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.035
I once did the best prank
of all time.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.770
I dumped all of my boss's
action figures

12:50.804 --> 12:52.905
- into a fish tank.
- Yeah, that was me.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.073
And I didn't really like it.

12:54.108 --> 12:55.675
Classic.

12:55.709 --> 12:57.343
Great news, guys.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.378
- I just saved your bacon.
- Impossible.

12:59.413 --> 13:00.613
You don't even know
where it is.

13:00.647 --> 13:01.981
I know you were excited to get

13:02.015 --> 13:04.517
in front of the committee
and rip it,

13:04.551 --> 13:05.885
but in the spirit of teamwork,

13:05.919 --> 13:08.821
I unilaterally decided
to bring Stu out of retirement.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.089
- So pressure's off.
- What?

13:10.124 --> 13:12.024
- I spent a lot of time on this.
- Doin' what,

13:12.059 --> 13:14.160
- putting mousse in your hair?
- It's a gel-based serum.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.195
Second of all,
who uses mousse still?

13:16.230 --> 13:17.897
Oh, God.
Leslie.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.498
Let's put our differences aside
for a second.

13:19.533 --> 13:21.267
Friend to friend,
do you still use mousse?

13:21.301 --> 13:25.338
No, I use the juicy space
thing--whatever you do.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.773
The point is you weren't ready
for this, Tom.

13:27.808 --> 13:30.109
Stu's sales are flat.
Lemonade's the future.

13:30.144 --> 13:31.310
I'm still doing
my presentation.

13:31.345 --> 13:33.112
I'm still doing
my stew presentation,

13:33.147 --> 13:34.313
and we'll see which one
the committee likes.

13:34.348 --> 13:36.048
- Fine.
- Fine.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.487
Yeah.

13:41.522 --> 13:43.723
I didn't think so.

13:45.420 --> 13:47.140
On the other hand,
there are some benefits

13:47.165 --> 13:48.432
to being married: Taxes,

13:48.467 --> 13:51.600
health insurance,
and I don't have to feel weird

13:51.720 --> 13:53.138
when hotel employees
call me "Mr. Perkins."

13:53.173 --> 13:55.507
Yeah, that makes me
feel weird too.

13:55.542 --> 13:57.643
Maybe we should.
I don't know anymore.

13:57.677 --> 14:00.112
"Maybe we should.
I don't know anymore."

14:00.146 --> 14:02.047
Ann, that is
a beautiful sentiment.

14:02.081 --> 14:03.215
Okay, you're all set.

14:03.249 --> 14:04.750
Credit card's been
fully refunded.

14:04.784 --> 14:06.051
Perfect timing.

14:06.086 --> 14:07.953
We <i>are</i> going to buy this ring.

14:07.987 --> 14:10.522
Charge it.

14:10.557 --> 14:12.357
[Sighs]

14:12.392 --> 14:16.228
Ann Perkins, will you marry me?

14:16.262 --> 14:18.931
- I don't know!
- [Laughs] Me either!

14:18.965 --> 14:21.633
- Maybe let's not?
- Yeah, I think maybe not.

14:21.668 --> 14:24.436
Okay.
Ring's yours again. Hello?

14:24.471 --> 14:27.306
Actually, we don't want
the ring.

14:27.340 --> 14:28.407
Unbelievable.

14:30.643 --> 14:32.244
Leslie, look.

14:32.278 --> 14:34.446
I'm the last person to want
to deprive the world

14:34.481 --> 14:37.149
of more stew, but are you sure
you wanna do this?

14:37.183 --> 14:39.551
Look, I love Tom,
but you and I both know

14:39.586 --> 14:41.353
that he's not ready to step up.

14:41.387 --> 14:43.555
Don't you remember his last
presentation on topsoil?

14:43.590 --> 14:45.357
The botched laser show?

14:45.391 --> 14:47.025
Larry still can't see purple.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.694
That was Larry's fault.

14:48.728 --> 14:50.929
He picked up the laser
and stared right into it.

14:50.964 --> 14:52.898
I know, but still,
Tom is all flash

14:52.932 --> 14:55.367
- and no substance.
- That's the old Tom.

14:55.401 --> 14:56.735
You've been gone
for a while, Leslie.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.070
Tom has changed.

14:58.104 --> 15:00.372
He ran a business,
sold it for a profit.

15:00.406 --> 15:02.708
He's also been working here
for six years,

15:02.742 --> 15:04.676
and he's learned a lot
from you.

15:04.711 --> 15:05.878
At some point,
you're gonna have

15:05.912 --> 15:08.714
to trust him to do his job.

15:10.016 --> 15:11.583
You guys.
You guys.

15:11.618 --> 15:12.751
- Be cool.
- What's going on?

15:12.785 --> 15:15.120
I kind of convinced Ben
to prank you guys,

15:15.155 --> 15:16.455
and it got
a little out of hand.

15:16.489 --> 15:18.657
I probably should've said no
to some of his ideas,

15:18.691 --> 15:19.992
but he's on his way here
right now.

15:20.026 --> 15:21.760
Here he is.
Just be cool.

15:21.794 --> 15:23.128
Hey, guys.
What's up?

15:23.163 --> 15:25.030
Um, oh, I just remembered.

15:25.064 --> 15:27.132
Can I show you something out
to the front area?

15:27.167 --> 15:29.802
And leave your cell phones
because of no reason.

15:29.836 --> 15:32.070
Just leave anything
that can't get wet, actually,

15:32.105 --> 15:34.807
like you would normally.

15:34.841 --> 15:37.142
[Sighs]

15:37.177 --> 15:39.278
Okay, here we go
to the parking lot now.

15:39.312 --> 15:41.780
Wow, this is really sad.

15:43.616 --> 15:45.084
Yep, follow to me, guys.

15:45.118 --> 15:48.720
Just going to the parking lot
for normal government reasons.

15:48.755 --> 15:50.222
[Breathing hard]

15:50.256 --> 15:51.290
Sorry, can't go through
with this.

15:51.324 --> 15:52.658
- I was gonna pull a prank.
- [Gasps]

15:52.692 --> 15:53.859
- No!
- Yeah.

15:53.893 --> 15:57.029
I hired these guys
in ski masks to kidnap us,

15:57.063 --> 15:58.664
and I was gonna pretend
to be a hero.

15:58.698 --> 16:00.966
They were gonna shoot me
and drive the van

16:01.000 --> 16:02.668
into the river,
and that's when the divers

16:02.702 --> 16:04.503
would go in,
pull you guys out of the water,

16:04.537 --> 16:06.105
and I would be standing
on the shore like,

16:06.139 --> 16:07.906
"Hey, you get pranked much?"

16:07.941 --> 16:09.241
What the [bleep]?

16:09.275 --> 16:12.177
I even got these squibs
from a special effects guy,

16:12.212 --> 16:14.179
and I was gonna say
this code word.

16:14.214 --> 16:15.894
And that's when I would
push this button.

16:15.915 --> 16:19.585
No, no, no, no, no!
[Squibs popping]

16:19.619 --> 16:22.421
Oh, my God.
You got blood all over me.

16:22.455 --> 16:23.722
Thank you.

16:23.757 --> 16:25.124
I mean it.

16:25.158 --> 16:28.127
- Ben, that was amazing.
- Really?

16:28.161 --> 16:29.728
Best prank ever.

16:31.231 --> 16:34.733
I'm sorry, buddy, daddy
can't get home to tuck you in.

16:34.768 --> 16:36.101
Oh, how old is your son?

16:36.136 --> 16:37.436
Just pick a thing.

16:37.470 --> 16:39.705
Honey, look at this.
This is what I want.

16:39.739 --> 16:42.007
I don't want a ring.
I don't want a wedding.

16:42.041 --> 16:43.442
I just want this locket

16:43.476 --> 16:45.277
with a picture of our child
in it.

16:45.311 --> 16:47.212
I mean, we've never
been traditional.

16:47.247 --> 16:49.181
We made out the first night
we ever met.

16:49.215 --> 16:51.150
And when we did date,
we broke up,

16:51.184 --> 16:52.151
but you didn't realize it,

16:52.185 --> 16:53.585
and that was very embarrassing
for you.

16:53.620 --> 16:55.554
Yeah, let's maybe not talk
about that part right now.

16:55.588 --> 16:57.456
And then we got pregnant
as friends,

16:57.490 --> 16:59.024
and then we fell in love.

16:59.058 --> 17:00.492
We've never been
very conventional,

17:00.527 --> 17:02.895
so why start now?

17:02.929 --> 17:05.063
Theodore? We will not
be needing that ring,

17:05.098 --> 17:07.532
but we would like
to purchase this locket.

17:07.567 --> 17:08.700
How much?

17:08.734 --> 17:10.469
Just take it
and get outta here.

17:10.502 --> 17:12.471
- Thank you!
- Thanks.

17:15.575 --> 17:17.810
We're here to discuss
a business contract

17:17.844 --> 17:20.179
for the Lafayette Park
food stand.

17:20.213 --> 17:21.847
Miss Knope,
you've always steered

17:21.881 --> 17:23.482
this committee
in the right direction.

17:23.516 --> 17:27.252
Why do you think we should renew
Hot Stu's lease?

17:28.922 --> 17:31.223
Well, frankly,
it's because of Stu.

17:31.257 --> 17:35.127
Here's a man
who was ready to retire,

17:35.161 --> 17:36.595
spend time
with his family, travel.

17:36.629 --> 17:39.731
And then he realized,
"No, I wanna spend my time

17:39.766 --> 17:42.134
"in a small metal box
all summer,

17:42.168 --> 17:46.071
bent over a boiling cauldron
of steaming, bubbling meat."

17:46.106 --> 17:47.439
Making stew is hard:

17:47.474 --> 17:49.408
Up at the crack of dawn,
backbreaking labor,

17:49.442 --> 17:52.177
your clothes smelling
like salt and gristle.

17:52.212 --> 17:53.612
Sure, profits are minimal,

17:53.646 --> 17:55.080
but Stu doesn't care
about that.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.850
Maybe a year extension
isn't enough.

17:57.884 --> 17:59.551
Maybe we should make it
five years.

17:59.586 --> 18:02.588
Heck, why don't we give him
a lifetime deal?

18:02.622 --> 18:04.857
I'd like to see Stu ladling out

18:04.891 --> 18:06.959
his pungent beef smoothies

18:06.993 --> 18:10.929
until we bury him
under that shed.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.198
I think I've made
a terrible mistake.

18:13.233 --> 18:14.833
Okay, that was bleak.

18:14.868 --> 18:18.203
Uh, Mr. Haverford, you have
a presentation as well?

18:18.238 --> 18:22.441
Hey.
Rip it.

18:22.475 --> 18:24.977
There's nothing more American
than lemonade.

18:25.011 --> 18:27.513
Just sayin' the word
makes you wanna drink some.

18:27.547 --> 18:29.448
And now you can.
Check under your seats.

18:29.482 --> 18:31.617
[Murmuring, giggling]

18:31.651 --> 18:34.219
Heh, hey.
Has my name on it.

18:34.254 --> 18:36.455
Yes, it does.
Classic for you, Carter.

18:36.489 --> 18:38.323
Darva,
yours is a pink lemonade.

18:38.358 --> 18:40.659
- I know you love that.
- Because I like pink.

18:40.693 --> 18:41.927
That's right.
Now, who here

18:41.961 --> 18:45.430
likes laser shows?

18:45.465 --> 18:49.501
Summer foot traffic in Lafayette
Park has increased 23%.

18:49.536 --> 18:51.670
The Indiana Brothers
are the fastest-growing

18:51.704 --> 18:53.472
beverage company
in the Midwest.

18:53.506 --> 18:55.541
My projections show
they can increase

18:55.575 --> 18:59.178
government revenue 30%
over the next five years.

18:59.212 --> 19:03.423
Plus, they've agreed to waive
their franchise fee.

19:03.663 --> 19:06.064
Look, guys, I'm sorry
about all the new rules,

19:06.184 --> 19:08.554
But--you know,
I want you to like me.

19:08.588 --> 19:10.789
But I-I also really need you
to respect me.

19:10.824 --> 19:13.092
I respect you, little buddy.

19:13.126 --> 19:14.093
Come here.

19:14.127 --> 19:15.327
Mm, respect noogie.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.862
Ah!

19:16.896 --> 19:18.664
We didn't prank you
'cause we don't respect you.

19:18.698 --> 19:20.199
We did it 'cause we love you.

19:20.233 --> 19:22.134
♪ R-e-s-p-e-g-c

19:22.168 --> 19:24.970
Well, that's actually not
how respect is spelled.

19:25.004 --> 19:26.438
- Yes.
- According to Urethra Franklin,

19:26.473 --> 19:27.639
that's exactly
how it's spelled.

19:27.674 --> 19:30.209
Hey, Wyatt.
You were a good sport earlier.

19:30.243 --> 19:31.543
No hard feelings?

19:32.946 --> 19:35.047
Here's a little gift for you
for believing in me.

19:35.081 --> 19:38.183
- Oh.
- It's a gel-based hair serum.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.552
Enough with the mousse,
for real.

19:40.587 --> 19:42.388
Okay.

19:42.422 --> 19:45.057
Well, Ron, you were right.
Tom has really grown up.

19:45.091 --> 19:46.525
You seem merely overjoyed

19:46.559 --> 19:48.327
instead of irritatingly
ecstatic.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.329
- Why?
- Well, Tom's come into his own.

19:50.363 --> 19:52.431
April runs Animal Control.

19:52.465 --> 19:54.733
I mean, does this department
even need me anymore?

19:54.768 --> 19:57.536
No.
We do not.

19:57.570 --> 19:59.104
April and Tom started out

19:59.139 --> 20:01.607
as two of the most apathetic
people I had ever met.

20:01.641 --> 20:03.375
It's why I hired them.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.177
Then you betrayed me
and turned them

20:05.211 --> 20:07.713
into efficient and caring
government employees.

20:07.747 --> 20:10.716
This office can indeed
function without you.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.518
And soon, it'll have to.

20:12.552 --> 20:13.852
Was that a death threat?

20:13.887 --> 20:17.089
We both know you're not
gonna be here forever.

20:17.123 --> 20:18.624
This is a weigh station

20:18.658 --> 20:20.893
on the road
to bigger and better things.

20:20.927 --> 20:23.562
Whenever you do move on,

20:23.596 --> 20:27.066
it should please you
to know that--

20:27.100 --> 20:28.367
God help me--

20:28.401 --> 20:31.670
you've built a well-functioning
government agency.

20:31.704 --> 20:32.905
Oh, that reminds me.

20:32.939 --> 20:34.640
I know you don't open
your mail, but I do.

20:34.674 --> 20:37.309
And because you created
Tom's position--

20:37.344 --> 20:38.944
business liaison--
and it's already

20:38.978 --> 20:42.081
financially paying off,
you have received

20:42.115 --> 20:44.650
Pawnee's government employee
of the month.

20:44.684 --> 20:47.486
I mean, it has taken--
