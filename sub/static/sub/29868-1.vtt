00:43.077 --> 00:46.445
[music playing]

01:47.308 --> 01:50.275
[wind blowing]

02:02.656 --> 02:05.624
[grunting]

02:24.278 --> 02:25.744
NARRATOR: The world
is a strange place.

02:28.883 --> 02:31.683
No one knows why we're here.

02:31.685 --> 02:38.423
And yet, every morning we
have to get up, get going,

02:38.425 --> 02:40.492
and find our place
with everyone else.

02:49.270 --> 02:57.376
But some days we just
feel like staying in bed

02:57.378 --> 02:58.610
and dreaming the day away.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.721
But life catches up with us
and we hang in there, right?

03:15.429 --> 03:17.796
Maybe because we
know there are heaps

03:17.798 --> 03:19.932
of things we haven't
done yet, or things

03:19.934 --> 03:22.467
we'd like to experience again.

03:22.469 --> 03:25.938
The gentle sound of a
caress, or a heartbeat.

03:46.827 --> 03:49.528
This is the story of Ailo.

03:49.530 --> 03:54.933
How he was born, how he grew
up, and how he was loved.

04:15.923 --> 04:19.024
April in the heart of Lapland.

04:19.026 --> 04:22.628
The far edge of
the Arctic Circle.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.264
For millennia at
the end of winter,

04:25.266 --> 04:27.466
the wild reindeer come
down from the mountains

04:27.468 --> 04:30.902
to reach the summer pastures
to give birth to their young.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.872
[dramatic music]

05:09.410 --> 05:11.510
This is Ailo's mother.

05:15.049 --> 05:16.948
He is still inside her belly.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.987
And she knows that he
will be born today.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.532
Normally, the female
reindeer manage

05:33.534 --> 05:38.003
to maintain their babies inside
until the end of the trip.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.505
They know that a
fawn born here will

05:40.507 --> 05:41.640
have little chance of survival.

05:44.411 --> 05:46.878
But the Earth's
climate is changing.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.749
Too hot, too cold.

05:50.751 --> 05:54.019
The females don't know
when to give birth.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.088
Now?

05:56.090 --> 05:57.856
Later?

05:57.858 --> 06:02.527
Ailo's mother can't
wait any longer.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.897
She has had to leave the
herd and find shelter.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.599
A little grass so
he won't be cold.

06:07.601 --> 06:10.369
[soft music]

07:00.454 --> 07:01.520
Meet Ailo.

07:01.522 --> 07:04.856
[soft music]

07:32.152 --> 07:36.755
Here in Lapland, children are
told that at birth, a reindeer

07:36.757 --> 07:40.559
only has five
minutes to stand up,

07:40.561 --> 07:45.630
five more to learn how
to walk, and five more

07:45.632 --> 07:48.700
to know how to run and swim.

07:48.702 --> 07:49.568
It's a matter of survival.

08:14.895 --> 08:18.830
Unfortunately, sometimes
a mother doesn't exactly

08:18.832 --> 08:20.999
know how to be a mother.

08:21.001 --> 08:24.569
[melancholy music]

08:42.589 --> 08:47.526
Is she afraid not to know
how to raise her baby?

08:47.528 --> 08:48.226
How to protect

08:48.228 --> 08:48.860
it?

09:25.198 --> 09:28.166
[hawk cries]

09:31.805 --> 09:34.205
Sometimes we have to make
overwhelming choices.

09:36.977 --> 09:41.146
Ailo's mother has two
conflicting instincts.

09:41.148 --> 09:48.219
Survive and return to the herd,
or be a mother and face danger.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.131
[wings flapping]

10:08.709 --> 10:12.043
[grunting]

10:27.961 --> 10:30.895
[hawk cries]

10:47.280 --> 10:49.247
This baby.

10:49.249 --> 10:54.319
His breath, his scent.

10:54.321 --> 10:59.290
She has made her choice to
raise him as best she can

10:59.292 --> 11:03.161
so that one day he
can live his own life

11:03.163 --> 11:04.929
as a reindeer of the far north.

11:54.347 --> 12:02.220
It's Ailo's first morning on
earth, and his first encounter.

12:02.222 --> 12:12.063
A frolicking squirrel who has
only one obsession, to eat.

12:21.141 --> 12:25.243
The squirrel goes a little too
fast for the newborn reindeer.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.112
But at least he makes
you want to stand up.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.788
Ailo has only been
here for a few hours,

12:36.790 --> 12:38.356
but already he
needs to coordinate

12:38.358 --> 12:39.891
the movements of his four legs.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.542
But you have to hurry, Ailo.

12:57.544 --> 13:01.546
Until you join the herd,
you will be very vulnerable.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.485
For now, your
mother protects you.

13:36.850 --> 13:39.150
She will be your
guide until you become

13:39.152 --> 13:42.086
a strong and brave reindeer.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.522
A prince of Lapland.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.458
[bleating]

14:11.251 --> 14:14.552
This forest is filled
with ruthless predators.

14:18.258 --> 14:21.626
But there are some who
are less worrisome.

14:28.401 --> 14:32.203
This is a white stoat.

14:32.205 --> 14:37.275
Have you ever noticed how some
people just make you feel calm?

14:37.277 --> 14:42.947
They walk smoothly,
like floating clouds.

14:42.949 --> 14:46.317
It's soothing just
to watch them.

14:51.591 --> 14:59.297
Well, the white stoat
is the polar opposite,

14:59.299 --> 15:01.599
but it doesn't prey on reindeer.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.102
Probably because of
the size difference.

15:10.644 --> 15:15.146
No, what a white
stoat likes is eggs.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.115
It loves eggs.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.918
[playful music]

15:43.576 --> 15:46.177
I told you.

15:46.179 --> 15:51.115
Soothing calm personified.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.655
Watch her.

15:57.657 --> 15:58.723
She's going to get angry.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.626
[playful music]

16:03.630 --> 16:06.531
[scurrying]

16:16.977 --> 16:19.444
But if he wants to
grow up in peace,

16:19.446 --> 16:21.446
Ailo needs to
continue on his way.

16:29.756 --> 16:30.655
A lemming.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.323
Forget about the eggs.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.259
[playful music]

16:48.508 --> 16:49.774
Yes.

16:49.776 --> 16:50.641
Forget about the eggs.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.785
[playful music ends]

17:03.390 --> 17:06.324
[suspenseful music]

17:06.326 --> 17:07.692
Oh well.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.194
Forget about the lemming too.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.529
And you better make
yourself scarce.

17:14.501 --> 17:18.803
That snack stealer
was a snowy owl.

17:18.805 --> 17:24.675
And snowy owls
really love lemmings.

17:24.676 --> 17:29.247
Snowy owls really love
white stoats, too.

17:29.249 --> 17:32.583
[dramatic music]

17:45.331 --> 17:49.233
It's time for Ailo and his
mother to leave the forest.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.235
They are now walking
out in the open.

17:55.742 --> 17:59.777
This baby reindeer was
also born too soon,

17:59.779 --> 18:01.679
but it wasn't as
fortunate as Ailo.

18:04.651 --> 18:08.252
Here in Lapland,
half of the reindeer

18:08.254 --> 18:09.854
die before they reach
their first birthday.

18:44.224 --> 18:47.125
Ailo was born only
three days ago.

18:47.127 --> 18:52.864
Every step he takes is
a victory, a challenge.

18:52.866 --> 18:57.568
Especially when you have such
short legs and such deep snow

18:57.570 --> 18:58.836
being warmed by the sun.

19:03.243 --> 19:06.577
Meanwhile, the herd
keeps pulling away.

19:12.418 --> 19:13.818
If you were thinking
that there are

19:13.820 --> 19:16.854
more dangerous things than
walking in melting snow,

19:16.856 --> 19:18.823
you were right.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.659
There is crossing a
frigid, raging river.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.885
Ailo, five minutes to
stand on your feet,

19:47.887 --> 19:51.556
five more to learn to
walk, and five more

19:51.558 --> 19:53.391
to know how to run and swim.

20:14.547 --> 20:19.951
Five to stand, five
to walk, five to swim.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.656
It's now or never.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.559
Exceed your limits or
stay there and wait

20:28.561 --> 20:29.694
to be conquered by the cold.

20:29.696 --> 20:32.630
[rushing water]

20:33.666 --> 20:36.634
[bleating]

21:05.298 --> 21:15.906
He could have collapsed, but
Ailo is not one to give up.

21:48.808 --> 21:52.643
Ailo is starting to understand
the rules of this world,

21:52.645 --> 21:54.812
and it's dangerous.

21:54.814 --> 21:59.884
And his heart begins to
beat a little harder.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.886
Is this a reindeer's life?

22:01.888 --> 22:04.488
Crossing raging
rivers, endlessly

22:04.490 --> 22:10.828
climbing from peak to peak, with
snow the only thing in sight?

22:10.830 --> 22:16.033
His mother knows his trail well,
their trail, the one his herd

22:16.035 --> 22:17.702
has been taking for centuries.

22:42.628 --> 22:46.497
A new sight appears before Ailo.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.599
The fjords.

22:48.601 --> 22:51.535
These immense
stretches of sea that

22:51.537 --> 22:53.537
carved the mountains like lace.

23:07.453 --> 23:08.719
These are the summer pastures.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.922
[hopeful music]

23:35.648 --> 23:37.047
The herd.

23:37.049 --> 23:41.185
It should be here at the
bottom of this valley.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.192
They did it.

23:48.194 --> 23:51.061
[triumphant music]

24:22.795 --> 24:26.831
At this point, Ailo
is only five days old.

24:26.833 --> 24:31.769
And yet, he has already learned
so much with his mother.

24:31.771 --> 24:36.040
Perseverance, courage,
self-confidence.

25:12.745 --> 25:18.983
And now he has a herd, a family.

25:22.922 --> 25:23.237
You're family.

25:23.238 --> 25:23.553
You're family.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.527
There's something
missing, isn't there?

25:41.307 --> 25:42.907
Why, yes.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.808
Other babies.

25:44.810 --> 25:48.012
[bleating]

26:02.862 --> 26:05.896
While Ailo was following
his mother in the mountains,

26:05.898 --> 26:08.899
dozens of fawns were born here.

26:08.901 --> 26:14.038
So many new cousins
of all colors.

26:14.040 --> 26:18.008
They don't know each other
yet, but when they leave,

26:18.010 --> 26:19.043
they will all be one.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.191
Until then, they
still have to struggle

26:34.193 --> 26:40.798
against the cold, rivers,
avalanches, or predators.

26:47.206 --> 26:51.375
The she-wolf has spotted the
herd, but she won't attack.

26:51.377 --> 26:53.344
Not today.

26:53.346 --> 26:56.113
Wolves never hunt alone.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.349
But she'll be back.

26:58.351 --> 27:00.618
You can count on that.

27:00.620 --> 27:03.220
She'll be back with
reinforcements.

27:15.901 --> 27:20.070
Three days have passed since
Ailo joined his family.

27:20.072 --> 27:23.307
Today is the day they set
out to find new lands.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.011
They don't hunt.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.779
They walk.

27:28.781 --> 27:31.348
They've been walking forever.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.084
They are the walkers
of the far north.

27:51.070 --> 27:56.206
Spring settles in and
melts everything around.

27:56.208 --> 27:59.309
This fella doesn't mind at all.

27:59.311 --> 28:00.944
He's been waiting long enough.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.765
Oh dear.

28:21.767 --> 28:23.701
He's going to have to
wait a little longer.

28:28.708 --> 28:32.076
[dramatic music]

29:21.293 --> 29:24.228
[chewing]

29:37.309 --> 29:40.077
This will be the first
mild spring night for Ailo.

29:45.484 --> 29:49.019
[ominous music]

30:04.970 --> 30:08.272
But this creature
approaching Ailo's family

30:08.274 --> 30:10.107
is never satisfied.

30:10.109 --> 30:13.243
It always wants more.

30:13.245 --> 30:16.146
It devours thousands
of acres of trees.

30:16.148 --> 30:19.349
[suspenseful music]

30:39.905 --> 30:43.240
[machinery whirring]

31:07.166 --> 31:10.534
[branches breaking]

31:19.178 --> 31:22.446
In order to get trees from
the heart of the forest,

31:22.448 --> 31:25.582
the machines make
their own roads.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.584
For us, a road connects people.

31:27.586 --> 31:31.188
For reindeer, it's an
insurmountable wall

31:31.190 --> 31:35.058
that frightens them and disrupts
their ancient migration route.

31:40.132 --> 31:41.598
Wild reindeer have
been following

31:41.600 --> 31:44.101
the same routes forever.

31:44.103 --> 31:47.204
They pass them on from
generation to generation.

31:47.206 --> 31:53.610
One day Ailo will know them too,
unless these routes disappear.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.057
Several weeks have passed.

32:07.059 --> 32:09.993
Ailo is an intrepid adventurer.

32:09.995 --> 32:13.563
He wants to see everything,
know everything.

32:13.565 --> 32:17.534
With his mother's encouragement
and the herd's protection,

32:17.536 --> 32:20.370
he feels nearly invincible.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.306
Polecats think they're
invincible too.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.621
Whoops, they really
are invincible.

32:37.623 --> 32:41.024
[bear cubs squawk]

32:51.270 --> 32:54.171
But be careful, Ailo.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.672
The she-wolf isn't alone.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.989
Now she has her pack.

33:17.396 --> 33:21.365
Two little wolves.

33:21.367 --> 33:24.534
But before opening the
hunt, this new mother

33:24.536 --> 33:27.070
has to train them first.

33:27.072 --> 33:30.007
And that starts by
following the rules.

33:30.009 --> 33:32.275
Don't wander off alone.

33:32.277 --> 33:35.145
[growling]

33:42.354 --> 33:45.222
I don't know if your mother
ever scolded you like that,

33:45.224 --> 33:47.157
baring her teeth and all.

33:47.159 --> 33:48.592
But I would have
been scared to death

33:48.594 --> 33:50.594
if my mother had done that.

33:54.466 --> 33:56.767
Ailo had better not
wait for the wolf cubs

33:56.769 --> 33:59.369
to go from playing to hunting.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.071
Better not linger around here.

34:18.322 --> 34:21.224
This little arctic fox would
have been quite satisfied

34:21.226 --> 34:24.293
with Ailo when he
could barely stand up,

34:24.295 --> 34:26.730
but the reindeer is too big now.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.697
The fox will have to
find something else.

34:34.273 --> 34:36.672
A lemming, for example.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.542
A chicken nugget of the Arctic.

34:41.612 --> 34:42.646
And he's easy to catch.

34:48.253 --> 34:51.855
Well, it should
be easy to catch.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.829
And the other one
mocking it from above.

34:58.831 --> 34:59.729
Remind you of anything?

35:04.503 --> 35:07.537
Replace the squirrel
with a crow,

35:07.539 --> 35:14.244
the pine cone with some cheese,
and the fox, well, with a fox.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.428
The reason the arctic
fox struggles so much

35:31.430 --> 35:34.164
is because he's not home here.

35:34.166 --> 35:37.200
He left the summits
to find his soulmate.

35:37.202 --> 35:41.438
But since there are only
200 wild arctic foxes in all

35:41.440 --> 35:43.140
of Lapland, it's not easy.

35:48.313 --> 35:51.148
His dream is to
start a family up

35:51.150 --> 35:52.649
there in the everlasting snow.

36:06.431 --> 36:08.798
It's finally summer in Lapland.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.300
Up here, you barely
have the time

36:10.302 --> 36:12.402
to say the word
summer when you can

36:12.404 --> 36:13.937
already feel it fading away.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.580
Ailo has grown.

36:23.582 --> 36:25.782
His coat has gotten darker.

36:25.784 --> 36:29.853
His antlers have
started to grow.

36:29.855 --> 36:34.891
One day he will be like this
male, tall and majestic.

36:34.893 --> 36:37.594
And the fawns will
look at him with a mix

36:37.596 --> 36:39.763
of fear and admiration.

36:39.765 --> 36:42.532
But size doesn't matter
against certain adversaries.

36:45.971 --> 36:47.737
Did you hear that?

36:47.739 --> 36:50.473
[buzzing]

36:50.475 --> 36:54.444
Do you hear those buzzing
clouds of minuscule UFOs

36:54.446 --> 37:00.550
that bombard you from all
sides and drive you crazy?

37:00.552 --> 37:02.953
One day we saw a tall
reindeer that leapt

37:02.955 --> 37:05.422
into the river to escape them.

37:05.424 --> 37:08.358
But the mosquitos
didn't give up.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.961
The reindeer went
deeper and deeper.

37:10.963 --> 37:14.464
Up to his neck, up to his ears.

37:14.466 --> 37:15.865
And he was never

37:15.867 --> 37:16.833
seen again.

37:36.455 --> 37:39.422
[buzzing]

37:45.430 --> 37:48.398
[grunting]

38:35.947 --> 38:38.415
The summer will soon be over.

38:38.417 --> 38:40.684
I told you it wasn't
going to last long.

38:46.892 --> 38:50.560
It's a signal that they soon
have to leave the lowlands.

39:02.641 --> 39:04.674
Mosquitoes don't go up there.

39:04.676 --> 39:07.644
Too cold, too windy.

39:07.646 --> 39:12.515
These are exactly the conditions
the little arctic fox loves.

39:12.517 --> 39:15.418
He's already up there
and his coat just

39:15.420 --> 39:16.720
changed color for the season.

39:21.993 --> 39:23.960
Hey.

39:23.962 --> 39:26.096
Is that?

39:26.098 --> 39:28.398
Could that be?

39:28.400 --> 39:28.832
Wow.

39:39.378 --> 39:41.711
Beauty of beauties, Venus.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.113
The first to light
the night stars.

39:48.687 --> 39:49.986
Oh no.

39:49.988 --> 39:51.121
What a disaster.

40:07.873 --> 40:10.006
The place is already taken.

40:16.648 --> 40:19.783
The father of these
cubs can't be far.

40:19.785 --> 40:20.817
He must have gone hunting.

40:20.819 --> 40:23.753
[soft music]

40:51.917 --> 40:54.851
Arctic foxes mate for life.

40:54.853 --> 40:57.086
It's different for reindeer.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.154
You'll see.

40:58.156 --> 40:59.122
We're getting there.

41:04.095 --> 41:05.962
September.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.832
Autumn here is like
a fireworks show.

41:08.834 --> 41:12.869
Everything suddenly goes
ablaze, as if nature were saying

41:12.871 --> 41:16.840
a flashy goodbye before entering
the black and white tunnel

41:16.842 --> 41:17.941
of the six coming months.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.755
Ailo is now five months old.

41:32.757 --> 41:35.925
His antlers have grown
more, and his coat

41:35.927 --> 41:38.061
has really gotten lighter.

41:38.063 --> 41:41.231
He's like a teenager at
the end of summer vacation.

41:41.233 --> 41:43.700
Something has changed
during the summer

41:43.702 --> 41:45.902
and hastens him toward
the adult world.

41:50.675 --> 41:54.077
Adult behavior fascinates
him, like this ritual

41:54.079 --> 41:55.044
to choose a mate.

42:00.118 --> 42:03.253
Because autumn in
Lapland is mating season.

42:06.558 --> 42:11.694
For adult males, that
means a tournament.

42:11.696 --> 42:13.162
It takes place up there.

42:13.164 --> 42:15.265
Two or three weeks of duels.

42:15.267 --> 42:19.068
They run, they collide,
and the winners receive

42:19.070 --> 42:22.739
the favors of up to 15 females.

42:22.741 --> 42:23.640
That's how they do it.

42:23.642 --> 42:26.276
[lowing and grunting]

42:39.224 --> 42:40.757
Look at those two.

42:40.759 --> 42:43.660
If their antlers
got stuck together,

42:43.662 --> 42:47.163
entangled, inseparable.

42:47.165 --> 42:50.333
And if that caused them to
fall together still attached.

42:54.005 --> 42:57.173
I'm not saying this to scare
you, but it could happen.

43:02.714 --> 43:06.015
One day when Ailo
has his big antlers,

43:06.017 --> 43:08.618
it will be his turn to join
the tournaments on the summit.

43:12.324 --> 43:15.892
But for now, he's still
like an adolescent just

43:15.894 --> 43:17.794
entering junior high school.

43:17.796 --> 43:21.598
You know, when you're new
and you don't know anyone.

43:21.600 --> 43:24.701
And then you spot someone
in the same situation.

43:24.703 --> 43:27.170
A hare, for example.

43:27.172 --> 43:32.175
You imitate him in order
to start up a conversation.

43:32.177 --> 43:36.312
Apparently imitating
helps you avoid rejection.

43:36.314 --> 43:38.181
You feel like you
belong to the clan.

43:38.183 --> 43:41.117
[cheerful music]

44:05.076 --> 44:06.709
And then you
approach each other.

44:10.415 --> 44:11.047
Or not.

44:24.896 --> 44:27.697
But in junior high
school, there are always

44:27.699 --> 44:30.400
one or two who like to fight.

44:30.402 --> 44:32.669
Here, it's the polecat brothers.

44:35.774 --> 44:39.976
It doesn't happen much between
friends, but in real life

44:39.978 --> 44:41.778
these two wouldn't
mind eating a hare.

44:46.351 --> 44:48.985
Except that that
prey usually flees.

45:02.867 --> 45:06.769
Big ears has figured
out the show.

45:06.771 --> 45:14.744
Destabilize the
enemy and then flee.

45:14.746 --> 45:15.178
Yes.

45:24.422 --> 45:27.156
The two fighters
are so convincing,

45:27.158 --> 45:28.925
they're able to scare
off big animals.

45:37.168 --> 45:39.135
Even a herd of
proud wild reindeer.

45:54.185 --> 45:58.321
But real fear, the kind
that chills your blood,

45:58.323 --> 45:59.889
is something else.

45:59.891 --> 46:02.058
It invades you like a poison.

46:02.060 --> 46:03.760
You feel a threat
all around you.

46:03.762 --> 46:05.361
You see it everywhere.

46:05.363 --> 46:09.298
In the shape of the clouds, the
sound of the wind in the trees.

46:09.300 --> 46:12.535
You can always tell yourself
it's just your imagination,

46:12.537 --> 46:14.337
that you're making up
stories because you're

46:14.339 --> 46:16.339
like to be scared,
or that you're

46:16.341 --> 46:18.407
too frightened by nature.

46:18.409 --> 46:19.208
But it doesn't go away.

46:23.314 --> 46:24.881
[hawk cries]

46:24.883 --> 46:26.215
[wolf howls]

46:30.221 --> 46:32.989
They're ready.

46:32.991 --> 46:36.359
It's the first time
they will hunt together.

46:36.361 --> 46:38.561
The young cubs
rehearsed this moment

46:38.563 --> 46:42.131
countless times while playing,
but it's not a game today.

46:42.133 --> 46:45.501
[dramatic music]

47:13.097 --> 47:17.133
Among wolves, the ancestral
technique has been passed down

47:17.135 --> 47:19.368
from generation to generation.

47:19.370 --> 47:20.570
It has been perfected.

47:27.045 --> 47:29.378
First, spot your prey.

47:32.083 --> 47:33.216
Consult with each other.

47:36.387 --> 47:41.891
Split up, isolate
it, and kill it.

47:48.499 --> 47:51.067
But though the she-wolf
is a great predator,

47:51.069 --> 47:52.568
she is still a worried mother.

47:55.306 --> 47:56.572
Hunting isn't child's play.

48:03.181 --> 48:06.549
[grunting]

48:29.540 --> 48:32.508
[suspenseful music]

50:27.792 --> 50:31.360
[melancholy music]

50:47.779 --> 50:50.746
[suspenseful music]

51:01.759 --> 51:04.727
[growling]

51:11.736 --> 51:14.703
[wolf howling]

51:31.155 --> 51:34.223
The mother's call,
more frightening

51:34.225 --> 51:37.193
than an earthquake
or a meteor shower.

51:37.195 --> 51:40.496
An implacable order
that the wolf will obey

51:40.498 --> 51:51.173
until he is an adult. Tonight,
one member of the herd

51:51.175 --> 51:52.108
will be missing.

52:06.858 --> 52:09.725
The wolf attack has scattered
the reindeer in the forest.

52:13.464 --> 52:14.263
Ailo is lost.

52:17.435 --> 52:19.401
Now he is alone in the taiga.

52:23.541 --> 52:25.774
Oh no.

52:25.776 --> 52:26.442
Not alone.

52:31.382 --> 52:32.715
The wolverine has spotted him.

52:38.789 --> 52:42.758
He is also called the
ghost of the taiga.

52:42.760 --> 52:45.594
[growling]

52:58.643 --> 53:03.212
Without a sound, the
hunter tracks his prey.

53:03.214 --> 53:06.448
Patience is his weapon.

53:06.450 --> 53:08.851
He knows that Ailo is
much faster than he is.

53:15.593 --> 53:20.930
So he skirts around him,
anticipating his movements.

53:26.537 --> 53:29.505
[sniffing and grunting]

54:04.275 --> 54:07.543
The wolverine sets up an ambush
and waits to drop on Ailo.

54:34.705 --> 54:37.640
[grunting]

54:42.046 --> 54:44.413
Ailo knows that bellowing.

54:59.563 --> 55:04.867
Except that it's
not the same smell.

55:04.869 --> 55:06.368
Not a familiar face.

55:09.473 --> 55:11.040
Ailo is like a stranger to them.

55:17.315 --> 55:19.648
Where is his mother?

55:19.650 --> 55:22.985
There's the scent of
milk, but it's not her.

55:27.525 --> 55:28.357
No, it's not her.

55:35.633 --> 55:39.335
The wolverine doesn't
care about the scent.

55:39.337 --> 55:42.671
This domesticated herd is
an all-you-can-eat buffet.

55:46.711 --> 55:49.578
Dozens of reindeer without
their wild instincts.

55:54.685 --> 55:56.085
Ailo has understood.

56:05.062 --> 56:07.996
[grunting]

56:18.509 --> 56:20.876
[dog whining]

56:23.481 --> 56:26.849
[barking]

56:26.851 --> 56:30.386
The wolverine knows
the dog's rituals.

56:30.388 --> 56:32.721
They keep watch all night long.

56:32.723 --> 56:34.757
But in the early
morning, they return

56:34.759 --> 56:39.728
to the campfires of the men and
they fall into a deep sleep.

56:39.730 --> 56:40.963
So he waits.

56:51.575 --> 56:56.044
After hours of searching,
finally a familiar scent.

56:56.046 --> 56:57.513
This time it's really her.

57:10.194 --> 57:14.696
What saved Ailo this time is
the instinct from the wild,

57:14.698 --> 57:16.565
everything his
mother taught him.

57:16.567 --> 57:18.033
Courage, will.

57:25.576 --> 57:28.744
All the things that are lost
when you're locked within four

57:28.746 --> 57:30.813
walls, cut off from nature.

57:37.988 --> 57:40.989
Eventually making
us lose our way.

57:45.463 --> 57:50.699
[dog whining]

57:50.701 --> 57:52.601
Do you think this
world is tough?

57:52.603 --> 57:53.969
Well, you're right.

57:53.971 --> 57:56.171
But it's our world too.

57:56.173 --> 58:02.177
It's made of flesh and blood,
water and fire, sorrow and joy.

58:02.179 --> 58:06.215
You make progress, you
fight, you pretend to fight.

58:06.217 --> 58:09.785
[reindeer cries]

58:44.755 --> 58:47.089
Winter comes without warning.

58:47.091 --> 58:47.856
Now they have to hold
out until spring.

58:52.830 --> 58:56.732
And, each in their own
way, that's what they do.

59:01.672 --> 59:04.306
For Ailo and his
herd, winter's arrival

59:04.308 --> 59:06.608
warns them that they
must reach the summit

59:06.610 --> 59:08.911
quickly before
they get exhausted

59:08.913 --> 59:11.146
walking in the deep snow.

59:11.148 --> 59:14.783
High in the mountains,
wind sweeps the snow away

59:14.785 --> 59:18.654
and precious lichen,
vital to their survival,

59:18.656 --> 59:19.555
is more accessible.

59:19.557 --> 59:22.691
[contemplative music]

59:53.691 --> 59:55.691
Each step is a struggle.

59:55.693 --> 59:58.860
Trapped by the cold, they
will slowly fall asleep.

01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:04.866
But the strongest will continue
to brave the Arctic winter.

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:15.844
[sniffing and grunting]

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:56.652
Ailo belongs to those who dare.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:06.828
But that's at-risk
behavior among adolescents.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:16.438
And yet, his audacity
is inspiring.

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:25.247
Step by step, Ailo becomes the
leader of the young reindeer.

01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:36.024
But at the slightest
mistake, the ghost of taiga

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:36.925
won't hesitate.

01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:47.302
Start trembling, or close your
eyes if you're too sensitive,

01:01:47.304 --> 01:01:50.038
because nothing can
stop the wolverine

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.239
from achieving its goals.

01:01:57.748 --> 01:02:01.183
Nothing can stop him from
swooping in on his prey.

01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:09.891
In the snow, the wolverine
has an advantage thanks

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:12.961
to his large paws
that don't sink in,

01:02:12.963 --> 01:02:14.262
unlike the reindeer's hooves.

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:17.232
[dramatic music]

01:02:39.189 --> 01:02:41.123
I'll tell you one last time.

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:52.100
Nothing can stop him, except
maybe a she-wolverine.

01:02:58.041 --> 01:03:01.009
[cheerful music]

01:03:16.059 --> 01:03:18.160
Hasn't that ever
happened to you?

01:03:18.162 --> 01:03:21.963
You meet someone who just
stops you in your tracks.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:25.467
Your heart beats for her.

01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:27.002
How can you approach her?

01:03:32.876 --> 01:03:34.509
Well, first there's
the direct approach.

01:03:34.511 --> 01:03:37.279
[cheerful music]

01:04:00.604 --> 01:04:02.070
But if that doesn't
work, you have to find

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:03.872
something to impress her.

01:04:03.874 --> 01:04:08.210
Something crazy that makes her
say, wow, that one is special.

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:13.548
So there's this.

01:04:24.428 --> 01:04:25.527
That's pretty good, huh?

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:31.333
And there's this, too.

01:04:31.335 --> 01:04:34.302
[cheerful music]

01:04:49.953 --> 01:04:54.155
The problem with rolling is that
you have so much fun that you

01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:56.124
forget everything, even love.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:14.042
Yep, love can wait.

01:05:14.044 --> 01:05:17.479
The she-wolverines up there
aren't like arctic foxes.

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:18.480
There are many of them.

01:05:34.131 --> 01:05:38.566
Speaking of love, the little
arctic fox has become white

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:41.169
and is still searching
for his soulmate.

01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:43.438
And all that searching
has made him hungry.

01:05:48.078 --> 01:05:51.012
[suspenseful music]

01:05:59.423 --> 01:06:02.490
White stoats have a
technique to escape foxes.

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:04.459
It might seem a little messy.

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:09.497
It's called, I'm
here, I'm not here.

01:06:09.499 --> 01:06:11.566
I'm here, I'm not here.

01:06:11.568 --> 01:06:14.536
I'm here, I'm not here.

01:06:14.538 --> 01:06:20.542
Now, this can go on for a
long time, a very long time,

01:06:20.544 --> 01:06:23.611
until the adversary
is no longer there.

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:29.651
I'm here, I'm not here.

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:33.188
[suspenseful music]

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:53.408
And so time goes
by in Ailo's world.

01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:56.244
The eagle like an
impartial guard,

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:59.180
separating the hours
and the seasons.

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:02.117
Like the spaces between words
which will never be heard.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:14.796
Words like Lakewall, the name of
this long, barely-frozen river

01:07:14.798 --> 01:07:17.565
that the reindeer will have
to risk their lives to cross.

01:07:20.704 --> 01:07:22.737
But they don't have a choice.

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:25.340
Waiting here until
the ice thickens

01:07:25.342 --> 01:07:26.775
would greatly
reduce their chance

01:07:26.777 --> 01:07:28.410
of reaching the summit in time.

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:59.374
[dramatic music]

01:08:13.824 --> 01:08:17.725
Do you remember, Ailo, your
first steps in the snow when

01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:19.861
your hooves landed in
the large footprints

01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:21.529
your mother made for you?

01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:23.598
She's still looking
out for you, but you

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.233
are already walking ahead.

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:28.169
[dramatic music]

01:09:02.706 --> 01:09:08.376
They don't know it, but
she's expecting another baby.

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:11.546
And you, prince of
the Arctic, have

01:09:11.548 --> 01:09:15.884
become a veritable
reindeer of the far north.

01:09:15.886 --> 01:09:18.586
Like your family,
you walk tirelessly

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:20.555
under the northern lights.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:26.294
Since the dawn of
time, these lights

01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:29.197
have been like
celestial maps that

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:32.567
have guided your ancestors
during this migration

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:34.702
through the polar night.

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:37.772
And soon, you will know
how to read them too.

01:10:07.737 --> 01:10:09.971
Now the sun has fled
to the other side

01:10:09.973 --> 01:10:12.273
of the Arctic Circle.

01:10:12.275 --> 01:10:14.409
It won't be seen
again for a long time.

01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:22.317
There's only a gloomy
light called [inaudible]..

01:10:22.319 --> 01:10:26.588
Something between dawn and dusk
as if time had stood still.

01:10:45.675 --> 01:10:48.276
Hey, an old acquaintance.

01:10:48.278 --> 01:10:51.613
[uplifting music]

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:21.376
Don't be upset, big ears,
but Ailo's playing days

01:11:21.378 --> 01:11:24.379
are long past.

01:11:24.381 --> 01:11:26.814
They have been
hardened by experience,

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:29.517
and he no longer sees
the world the same way.

01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:42.497
What is that strange tree
growing in this sleeping lake?

01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:44.799
That's a sad tree.

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:48.036
But remember, Ailo,
that a beautiful battle

01:11:48.038 --> 01:11:50.738
gave birth to this tree.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:54.475
One of these two
males, the winner,

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:58.513
would have won the favors of
all the females in the herd.

01:11:58.515 --> 01:12:01.516
But the fire in their
hearts was so great

01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:06.321
that their antlers got stuck
together and couldn't separate

01:12:06.323 --> 01:12:09.557
while the water turned to ice.

01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:15.596
Bird of ill omen.

01:12:15.598 --> 01:12:17.031
Ailo knows it.

01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:19.534
Ailo knows how to
read signs now.

01:12:19.536 --> 01:12:22.603
The crow draws the
wolves towards the prey

01:12:22.605 --> 01:12:25.707
so that it can
have the leftovers.

01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:27.108
Better not linger around here.

01:12:32.349 --> 01:12:33.081
They're coming.

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:36.484
[cawing]

01:12:52.902 --> 01:12:56.437
[suspenseful music]

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:34.976
But what really interests
wolves is fresh meat.

01:13:34.978 --> 01:13:36.677
The crow guides them.

01:13:36.679 --> 01:13:39.614
[dramatic music]

01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:27.895
Not a second to lose
for the reindeer.

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:30.231
They have never stopped
walking and leave

01:14:30.233 --> 01:14:33.034
the forest to enter a region
where almost nothing grows.

01:14:33.036 --> 01:14:35.770
[dramatic music]

01:15:06.903 --> 01:15:10.037
This time, the
reindeer were faster.

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:11.873
This snow is too
deep for the wolves.

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:33.261
Up here, blizzards are yet
another challenge for Ailo

01:15:33.263 --> 01:15:35.263
and his fellow creatures.

01:15:35.265 --> 01:15:38.666
Temperatures down to
minus 40, more and more

01:15:38.668 --> 01:15:41.002
frequent at this latitude.

01:15:41.004 --> 01:15:44.238
How much longer will
the people of the Arctic

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.073
hold out in the changing world?

01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:49.043
[wind blowing]

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:03.624
[grunting]

01:16:47.003 --> 01:16:49.971
[hopeful music]

01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:54.375
For the first time,
Ailo discovers

01:16:54.377 --> 01:16:59.113
the windy peaks where the herd
will pass the next six months.

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:04.719
And this treasure,
their treasure, lichen.

01:17:04.721 --> 01:17:08.222
Thanks to it, they
will be able to survive

01:17:08.224 --> 01:17:10.024
in the heart of this icy world.

01:17:21.904 --> 01:17:23.938
It's freezing cold.

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:25.906
I mean, yes, there
are terrible days.

01:17:25.908 --> 01:17:27.375
There are heartbreaking days.

01:17:27.377 --> 01:17:30.811
Sad days, hungry
days, cold days.

01:17:38.921 --> 01:17:41.656
But there are also lucky days.

01:17:56.072 --> 01:17:57.071
Happy days.

01:17:57.073 --> 01:18:00.041
[hopeful music]

01:18:50.426 --> 01:18:52.326
Time has passed.

01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:54.261
An eternity.

01:18:54.263 --> 01:18:58.499
Soon, Ailo will be one year old.

01:18:58.501 --> 01:19:01.736
Soon, his mother and
the other females

01:19:01.738 --> 01:19:03.070
will give birth to other young.

01:19:06.109 --> 01:19:11.946
The time has come
to live without her,

01:19:11.948 --> 01:19:16.050
to live his adult life.

01:19:16.052 --> 01:19:16.884
So he trains.

01:19:16.886 --> 01:19:19.453
[grunting]

01:19:36.839 --> 01:19:45.045
Soon the light will reappear,
and with it will come new

01:19:45.047 --> 01:19:45.479
adventures.

01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:03.898
So go ahead Ailo, young
prince of Lapland.

01:20:17.113 --> 01:20:19.280
The world is a strange place.

01:20:19.282 --> 01:20:23.250
Sometimes it's so hard that
we want to give up on it.

01:20:23.252 --> 01:20:25.920
To say, forget about me.

01:20:25.922 --> 01:20:28.122
Go on as if I weren't here.

01:20:28.124 --> 01:20:32.993
And yet, each time that we
decide to get back on our feet

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:36.030
and face life squarely
as it is, the world

01:20:36.032 --> 01:20:38.199
ends up smiling on us.

01:20:38.201 --> 01:20:41.202
[music playing]
