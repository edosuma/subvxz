01:10.462 --> 01:11.998
Ssh.

01:45.397 --> 01:47.499
Evening, Marney.

01:47.532 --> 01:49.367
Hi, Ian.

01:49.401 --> 01:50.937
How's it going?

01:50.970 --> 01:52.672
It's going good. How are you?

01:52.705 --> 01:56.976
Did you hear that music
down the street last night?

01:57.009 --> 02:01.446
Uh, no, I didn't.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.281
What was it, some kind of party?

02:03.315 --> 02:05.651
I think it was a rock band.

02:05.685 --> 02:09.588
I went over there and then
told them knock it off,

02:09.621 --> 02:13.025
it's the middle of the night
in the middle of the week.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.863
Kids.

02:16.896 --> 02:19.564
Punks is what they are
to call themselves.

02:19.598 --> 02:21.600
I think that is what
they call themselves.

02:22.835 --> 02:23.736
Have a good one, Ian.

02:24.937 --> 02:25.838
See you later.

02:48.060 --> 02:49.028
Bruce.

02:55.567 --> 02:58.037
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

03:06.611 --> 03:08.580
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

03:11.717 --> 03:14.486
Oh, no. What the...

03:19.959 --> 03:22.427
Hello, yeah, yeah.

03:22.460 --> 03:24.697
I... Yeah, I...

03:24.730 --> 03:28.134
I think somebody
broke into my house.

03:28.167 --> 03:30.402
I don't know, I just got home.

03:31.603 --> 03:34.974
No, no, I know nothing. I think
they broke it to my house and...

03:37.977 --> 03:39.078
Killed my cat.

03:41.047 --> 03:42.081
Okay.

03:58.463 --> 03:59.564
Okay.

04:53.119 --> 04:54.519
Hey, Richard.

04:55.688 --> 04:57.757
Oh, no, no,
not interrupting anything.

04:57.790 --> 05:00.159
I'm just putting this crib
together.

05:02.194 --> 05:03.796
What's up? Yeah.

05:07.066 --> 05:10.236
Tonight, I'd love that.

05:10.269 --> 05:13.873
Yeah, I just need to talk to my wife,
but she should be home any minute.

05:14.974 --> 05:17.109
I definitely want to come.
It sounds great.

05:18.678 --> 05:20.112
Your friends sound awesome.

05:22.514 --> 05:23.548
No, I could drive myself.

05:24.817 --> 05:26.919
Well, if it's on your way then
sure, I just, I don't want to...

05:26.953 --> 05:29.554
What? Hold on, hold on.

05:30.823 --> 05:32.590
What are you doing? Hi.

05:34.260 --> 05:35.861
- Whom are you talking to?
- No one, it's fine, one second.

05:37.630 --> 05:40.498
Yeah, she actually just
walked in. It should be fine.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.035
Yeah, okay, thanks, Richard.

05:43.069 --> 05:45.503
- Bye. Oh.
- What should be fine?

05:46.739 --> 05:47.873
Nothing.

05:47.907 --> 05:50.076
- Who's Richard?
- Remember, um,

05:50.109 --> 05:52.544
I told you
I met that guy at a bar.

05:52.577 --> 05:54.213
Uh-huh. I guess.
What does he want?

05:55.314 --> 05:57.817
Just wants to meet-up tonight.

05:57.850 --> 05:59.819
Oh, he asked you on a date?

05:59.852 --> 06:00.920
Very funny.

06:02.221 --> 06:03.122
How was your day?

06:04.123 --> 06:05.825
- It was bad.
- I know.

06:05.858 --> 06:08.627
Got a new school,
substitute teacher, you know.

06:08.661 --> 06:10.595
- Yeah. All right.
- Just fresh meat to those kids.

06:10.629 --> 06:15.167
- Rough. Kids suck.
- Plus, you know I'm gigantic.

06:17.169 --> 06:20.206
You are not. Beautiful.

06:22.875 --> 06:24.010
Did you finish the crib?

06:26.779 --> 06:30.783
I didn't,
but it'll be done by tomorrow.

06:31.751 --> 06:33.551
- Great.
- Yeah.

06:33.585 --> 06:35.021
- Did you hear that?
- What?

06:42.962 --> 06:44.096
What's he saying?

06:45.798 --> 06:48.734
- Call me Jackson.
- What?

06:50.169 --> 06:53.605
- We just decided on Grayson.
- I know, but...

06:53.639 --> 06:55.741
- We don't have that much time.
- We do.

06:55.775 --> 06:58.677
He could come any day now and we
need to have decided on a name.

06:58.711 --> 07:04.984
I know, but, you know, I think that
when we see his little baby face,

07:05.017 --> 07:06.752
we'll know.

07:06.786 --> 07:08.788
- We'll just know.
- This is so like you.

07:08.821 --> 07:12.725
- It's one of those things.
- A man with no plan, just winging it.

07:14.827 --> 07:17.630
Okay.

07:26.172 --> 07:27.106
You got to see these.

07:30.376 --> 07:31.277
Mmm.

07:32.945 --> 07:34.880
Up to no good.

07:34.914 --> 07:35.981
Do you want to come
out this time?

07:39.385 --> 07:40.286
Oh, come on.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.056
Richard's an interesting guy,
you'd like him, it'd be fun.

07:44.090 --> 07:45.991
And we should make
an effort to...

07:47.093 --> 07:49.328
This isn't fun.
You don't have fun around here.

07:49.361 --> 07:52.698
I'm not saying that, just we
used to have fun all the time.

07:53.699 --> 07:55.768
I have to get out of the house.

07:55.801 --> 07:58.637
Yeah. Yeah, it's not my idea of
fun tonight to go to some bar

07:58.671 --> 08:02.007
and watch you and your new
old friend drinking together.

08:02.041 --> 08:05.177
- He's not even that old.
- Okay.

08:05.211 --> 08:06.145
He's nice.

08:07.113 --> 08:10.683
You should go
and have a really good time.

08:10.716 --> 08:14.053
You've been cooped up all day, you don't
have work in the morning. You should go.

08:14.086 --> 08:16.355
I'm exhausted,
but you should go.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.152
Oh, my God.

10:28.655 --> 10:32.057
- Yo, you guys trying to sneak out tonight?
- I don't know, man.

10:32.091 --> 10:34.827
My mom would kill me if she found
out I was skating that late,

10:34.860 --> 10:36.228
I don't know if I could do it.

10:37.863 --> 10:41.834
Again, like he said, like it depends
like my mom goes to sleep around, like...

10:41.867 --> 10:44.436
- It's crazy sometimes...
- My mom goes to sleep early.

10:44.470 --> 10:47.840
I don't know what time my mom
exactly goes to sleep,

10:47.873 --> 10:52.511
but if she goes to sleep and like
it's not hot or like dangerous,

10:52.544 --> 10:56.448
look I'll go, but like you'll go
regardless, even if we don't go.

10:56.482 --> 10:58.984
Yeah, man, but I'm just saying
you guys are going to miss out.

11:13.532 --> 11:16.302
Yeah, bruh, that would have been
some sick ass shit.

11:29.548 --> 11:31.016
Get that gap next time, bro.

11:31.050 --> 11:32.418
Yeah, I know I should
have stuck it.

11:32.451 --> 11:35.087
Come here.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.455
Come here.
You want some food, Luna?

11:37.990 --> 11:39.925
- Yo, you guys want some noodles, by the way?
- Yeah, sure, I'll take a cup.

12:13.292 --> 12:15.527
Oh, you get wrecked, man.

12:15.561 --> 12:17.563
- Bro, I killed them twice, I killed them twice in a row.
- Oh, thanks, man

12:17.596 --> 12:20.232
Dude, you just got blasted
in the basement.

12:20.265 --> 12:23.102
You got blasted in the base wax.

12:23.135 --> 12:25.471
- I am. How many cues you got?
- We're tied. Shut up.

12:27.139 --> 12:28.040
We're tied.

12:32.544 --> 12:35.180
- Get in here before it starts pissing rain.
- Coming.

12:35.214 --> 12:38.384
- All right, thanks for getting me.
- Yeah, man.

12:39.385 --> 12:41.987
- So you got fired today.
- Well, I left.

12:42.020 --> 12:45.023
It's not like losing a janitorial
job something to be too upset about.

12:45.057 --> 12:46.358
Have you had many jobs?

12:48.293 --> 12:51.263
Yeah, I mean, yeah,
I guess I worked, um...

12:53.065 --> 12:55.534
worked as a bartender
for a little while.

12:55.567 --> 12:59.271
I was a bank clerk, I worked as a
deli cook, you name it I can do it.

12:59.304 --> 13:03.008
- Pretty decorated.
- Yeah, you could call it. Yeah. What about you?

13:03.041 --> 13:07.079
- You had a lot of jobs.
- Yeah, I've had a couple, but mostly as an editor.

13:07.112 --> 13:09.214
All right, I remember you saying
that when we were at the bar.

13:09.248 --> 13:11.316
I remember you telling me
you were a film editor.

13:11.350 --> 13:14.987
Film editor. It's a stretch.
I do like online commercials.

13:15.020 --> 13:17.256
I just did a commercial
for a sink faucet.

13:18.290 --> 13:20.392
So that's where I'm at.

13:20.426 --> 13:22.294
That's pretty great.
You get to stay at the house all day,

13:22.327 --> 13:24.496
I didn't even think of that,
you get to work from home.

13:24.530 --> 13:27.332
No.
That's actually kind of shitty.

13:27.366 --> 13:32.204
Like never see anyone, you know, like,
I'd prefer to be out in the world.

13:32.237 --> 13:34.440
It was easier to do that
when I was in the city.

13:34.473 --> 13:37.176
I don't know, people are pretty
much the same anywhere you go.

13:37.209 --> 13:40.279
Like all places,
you got interesting people.

13:40.312 --> 13:45.685
People not so interesting, nice people,
shitty people, good people, bad people.

13:45.718 --> 13:48.520
So, you're saying...

13:48.554 --> 13:53.058
What? I mean, since it's all the same
what exactly, just stay where you are.

13:53.091 --> 13:56.528
Yeah. I'm not saying like this place is better
than other places or anything like that.

13:56.562 --> 13:59.164
I'm... I'm... Obviously,
I like it. I like it, you know.

14:00.165 --> 14:07.206
I like my house, I like my car, I like, uh,
getting drunk with my friends at my bar,

14:07.239 --> 14:11.376
you know, so for me,
it's just this is what I like.

14:14.179 --> 14:18.685
I don't want this to sound rude, but
do you grow up wanting to do something,

14:18.718 --> 14:23.322
like be an astronaut
or an actor?

14:23.355 --> 14:28.360
So did I want to grow up, you
know, to be an ambitious person.

14:28.393 --> 14:31.063
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:33.332 --> 14:34.533
Well, what happened?

14:35.635 --> 14:38.270
Well, reality is what happened.

14:38.303 --> 14:43.375
If your kids go to college and they're going
to read, uh, Nietzsche and Madame Bovary,

14:43.408 --> 14:46.311
they'll bind that all up
and do precisely what with it?

14:47.747 --> 14:49.682
Serve burgers with me.

14:49.716 --> 14:52.719
That's okay, man.
Cut him some slack, right?

14:53.753 --> 14:57.489
Encourage them to find something they
enjoy, something that makes them happy,

14:57.523 --> 14:59.692
because we're all going
to end up in the same spot.

14:59.726 --> 15:04.563
The burger flipper and the Nobel
Laureate both shit sitting down,

15:04.596 --> 15:10.569
we're both gonna die someday the same way,
confused, scared, full of regret, right?

15:10.602 --> 15:14.406
Because we're visitors here,
man, that's the thing, Jimmy.

15:14.439 --> 15:16.108
We're just visitors down here.

15:31.189 --> 15:34.326
Hey, Natalie, it's getting cold.
Why don't you bring Polly inside?

15:48.908 --> 15:51.310
Okay. Come on, it's cold.

15:51.343 --> 15:52.444
Can you put Polly
in the living room?

15:53.780 --> 15:54.681
Thank you.

16:03.890 --> 16:06.291
Why can't Polly live in my room?

16:06.325 --> 16:08.661
Because she'd make too much
noise, she'd keep you up at night.

16:10.162 --> 16:12.230
Then how about the backyard?

16:12.264 --> 16:14.667
I think it's too cold for her
out there, don't you think?

16:14.701 --> 16:15.601
No.

16:17.469 --> 16:19.806
- We'll find her a nice place inside.
- Okay.

16:21.506 --> 16:23.776
- Go wash your hands, dinner's almost ready.
- Mm-hm.

16:29.749 --> 16:33.385
- Something going on outside.
- What?

16:34.821 --> 16:37.456
There's a cop car
parked outside of, um...

16:38.725 --> 16:41.426
What's that lady across
the street's name, Mary?

16:41.460 --> 16:43.663
- Marney. What's going on?
- Hey.

16:43.696 --> 16:44.596
Careful.

16:47.399 --> 16:50.268
- I don't know.
- I hope everything's all right.

16:51.269 --> 16:53.372
I'm gonna go over there
and see what's going on.

16:54.306 --> 16:55.507
What are you gonna do about it?

16:56.676 --> 16:59.746
I just wanna know
what's going on around here.

16:59.779 --> 17:00.680
Aren't you curious?

17:02.447 --> 17:03.716
I hope Marney's okay.

17:05.517 --> 17:06.518
I'll report back.

17:07.586 --> 17:09.821
Uh, bring an umbrella,
looks like it's gonna rain.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.537
Can I help you?

17:25.569 --> 17:27.940
I just live right across
the street there,

17:27.973 --> 17:29.608
and I was wondering
if everything was all right.

17:29.642 --> 17:31.543
- Somebody killed Bruce.
- What?

17:31.576 --> 17:33.245
- Her cat.
- Stomped him to death.

17:34.312 --> 17:37.382
Animal control just picked up
the body about 40 minutes ago.

17:37.416 --> 17:40.485
Things like this have been
reported the last few weeks, so...

17:40.519 --> 17:41.888
Pets being killed.

17:41.921 --> 17:44.456
Why doesn't the public know
about this?

17:44.489 --> 17:47.259
Well, at first,
it'd appear to be unrelated,

17:47.292 --> 17:49.361
but we're doing everything
we can to catch the perp.

17:49.394 --> 17:51.396
- Yeah, but...
- Let us know

17:51.430 --> 17:53.866
if you can think of anyone else
who might have done this.

17:56.035 --> 17:58.503
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

18:03.375 --> 18:07.579
- What an asshole!
- I thought he was nice.

18:07.612 --> 18:09.916
You're all right. Is there
anything we can do for you?

18:09.949 --> 18:11.718
- Fine, thank you.
- Are you sure?

18:11.751 --> 18:13.920
Really, I'm fine, thank you.
I just...

18:16.956 --> 18:20.258
I think I'd like to just be
by myself for a while.

18:21.293 --> 18:22.762
Let us know
if you need anything.

18:22.795 --> 18:24.731
Remember, we're just
right across the street.

18:33.305 --> 18:34.006
What are you doing out?

18:36.876 --> 18:37.777
Come on.

18:57.864 --> 18:58.765
Is this your house?

19:02.467 --> 19:03.803
Wow.

19:10.710 --> 19:11.610
It's nice.

19:12.845 --> 19:13.946
It's my house, man.

19:13.980 --> 19:15.648
- You grew up here?
- Yeah.

19:15.681 --> 19:16.749
- Damn.
- Yeah.

19:19.752 --> 19:22.487
- After you, sir.
- Thanks. I'm just...

19:22.521 --> 19:25.557
- Oh, okay.
- So I'll get you a drink or something?

19:26.525 --> 19:28.694
Uh, are you just going
to grab some stuff?

19:29.929 --> 19:32.698
- No, I mean...
- Thought we're going to the bar.

19:32.732 --> 19:35.001
I can't afford to go to a bar,
I just lost my job.

19:35.034 --> 19:38.470
- I could treat you.
- I know. I got a fully-stocked bar in here.

19:38.503 --> 19:41.540
- Come on.
- . It's too late.

19:41.573 --> 19:43.575
I've been inside all day.
I'm stuck inside.

19:43.608 --> 19:47.079
Just trust me, I invited people over.
We're gonna have a little party.

19:47.113 --> 19:50.415
We can have a party at a bar,
tell them to meet us at the bar.

19:50.448 --> 19:51.784
- This is better.
- Why?

19:51.818 --> 19:53.753
Just trust me. Come on.

19:57.023 --> 19:57.990
What are you drinking?

20:00.827 --> 20:03.763
How was that last take? Do you think
we should do it again or did it seem...

20:03.796 --> 20:07.934
I think the wind was picking
up a little bit on your mic, at the end.

20:07.967 --> 20:10.602
- All right.
- Let's just start again from your out throw.

20:10.636 --> 20:12.972
- Okay.
- All right. Go ahead.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.707
Oh, wait a second,
They're gonna walk through.

20:14.740 --> 20:16.776
Hi, sir, my name's Jane.

20:16.809 --> 20:20.412
- Hi, Jane.
- Um, would... Would you mind if I interviewed you?

20:20.445 --> 20:23.983
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- No, I... We're doing a story on pet owners in the community

20:24.016 --> 20:27.720
and I really think it would help raise
awareness about the issues, if...

20:27.753 --> 20:30.388
- What is the story?
- Oh, you haven't heard.

20:30.422 --> 20:33.626
There's been multiple pet
slayings in the neighborhood.

20:33.659 --> 20:36.796
- Oh, my God. That's shocking.
- Yeah.

20:36.829 --> 20:39.799
I... really think it would help
raise awareness, I think...

20:39.832 --> 20:41.566
I think people should know
about this.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.602
- All right, sure, yeah.
- Oh, great, thank you so much.

20:43.636 --> 20:45.838
I really...
I really appreciate it. Um...

20:48.841 --> 20:52.678
<i>I'm here right in front
of Marney Wilson's house.</i>

20:52.712 --> 20:56.816
- <i>Oh, my God, it happened here?</i>
- <i>Uh, yeah, right here.</i>

20:56.849 --> 20:59.018
<i>Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I cut you off. I'm sorry.</i>

20:59.051 --> 21:01.854
<i>That's okay, that's okay.
Um, let's start again.</i>

21:01.888 --> 21:04.522
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>We'll just do it again.</i>

21:04.556 --> 21:05.457
- <i>Ready?</i>
- <i>Yep.</i>

21:05.490 --> 21:06.893
<i>Okay, cool.</i>

21:10.663 --> 21:14.934
<i>I'm right here, right in front
of the scene of the crime,</i>

21:14.967 --> 21:20.806
<i>where Marney Wilson's cat was brutally
murdered right in her own backyard.</i>

21:20.840 --> 21:24.609
<i>I'm standing here now with a concerned
pet owner from the community.</i>

21:25.778 --> 21:29.982
- <i>What is your name, sir?</i>
- <i>Isaac Lieber.</i>

21:30.016 --> 21:32.985
<i>And what do you do for a living,
Mr. Lieber?</i>

21:33.019 --> 21:36.488
- <i>I am a social studies teacher.</i>
- <i>That's great.</i>

21:36.521 --> 21:42.560
<i>And how do you feel after hearing that such
awful things are happening in your community?</i>

21:42.594 --> 21:47.499
<i>I feel very bad and sad about it and as I
said before, I think it's quite shocking,</i>

21:47.532 --> 21:50.736
<i>because I've lived in this neighborhood
for over 10 years with my family,</i>

21:50.770 --> 21:53.239
<i>and I have never heard
of anything like this happening.</i>

21:53.272 --> 21:55.975
<i>This is, by far, the worst thing
that has ever happened here.</i>

21:56.876 --> 22:01.681
<i>Do you have any idea who could
be behind such horrible acts?</i>

22:01.714 --> 22:05.751
<i>No, your guess is as good as mine, but
it's obviously, someone who is very sick.</i>

22:06.719 --> 22:10.790
<i>It could be a kid or it could be an adult,
but whoever it is, they're very sick.</i>

22:10.823 --> 22:15.061
<i>Mm. Yes. Very sick indeed.</i>

22:15.094 --> 22:18.764
<i>And will you be taking any
precautions with your own dog,</i>

22:18.798 --> 22:22.201
<i>uh, until the person perpetrating
these acts is caught?</i>

22:22.234 --> 22:24.971
<i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

22:25.004 --> 22:28.674
<i>Franny here usually roams freely, she comes
and goes as she pleases. Isn't that right?</i>

22:28.708 --> 22:32.912
<i>But from now on, if she's in our backyard,
we're going to have our eyes on her,</i>

22:32.945 --> 22:34.880
<i>and if we're not there,
she gonna be inside,</i>

22:34.914 --> 22:38.184
<i>because we want her to be safe
until things go back to normal.</i>

22:39.986 --> 22:44.256
<i>Well, I sure hope things
get back to normal soon too.</i>

22:45.257 --> 22:47.827
- <i>Thank you, sir.</i>
- <i>You're welcome.</i>

22:47.860 --> 22:49.996
<i>It's good? Did you like that?</i>

22:51.697 --> 22:53.032
Come on, come on, come on.

22:54.667 --> 22:55.600
Damn.

22:57.003 --> 23:00.172
Oh, my God.
All right, I got to go.

23:00.206 --> 23:02.775
- I got band practice, man.
- I'll see you later.

23:02.808 --> 23:06.846
- Yeah, I'm going to leave.
- , so you can give me a ride to my mom's house.

23:06.879 --> 23:09.248
- Yeah, sure. No problem.
- Thank you.

23:09.281 --> 23:10.850
- You are out too.
- Yeah, bro.

23:10.883 --> 23:12.617
- All right. Peace out, bro?
- See you, guys.

23:12.651 --> 23:16.022
- I'll hit you over.
- All right, that'd be a place.

24:06.138 --> 24:07.073
Hi, Ian.

24:08.274 --> 24:09.607
I heard, Marney.

24:12.044 --> 24:13.179
Heard about Bruce.

24:15.147 --> 24:16.581
News travels fast.

24:17.716 --> 24:21.687
Yeah, well, Chinese guy
next door told me all of them.

24:23.222 --> 24:25.291
He's Korean.

24:25.324 --> 24:28.761
Yeah, well,
he was all

24:30.763 --> 24:34.400
through their whole damn
neighborhood lock their doors.

24:38.771 --> 24:39.939
Brought you some beers.

24:40.973 --> 24:44.210
Figured you could use one.

24:44.243 --> 24:46.912
Yeah, you know, Ian, thanks
but I am...

24:48.380 --> 24:50.349
Yeah, I'm not really much
of a beer person.

24:53.819 --> 24:54.720
Yeah, well.

24:57.056 --> 24:59.892
You might change your mind,
I'm gonna leave them.

25:14.907 --> 25:15.841
Ian.

25:15.875 --> 25:16.809
Yeah?

25:21.380 --> 25:25.851
Sorry, do you want to come in
and have one?

25:36.095 --> 25:39.798
You remember Mike at the bar?
Mike was the other guy.

25:39.832 --> 25:43.369
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay, so check this out.

25:43.402 --> 25:48.040
I saw Mike last week, he was all busted
up, 'cause his dog went missing.

25:48.073 --> 25:52.878
I saw him last night, and
he say, "Well, my dog's back."

25:52.912 --> 25:54.480
Oh, that's great.

25:54.513 --> 25:57.183
Oh, not so fast, somebody
had taken the dog's body,

25:57.216 --> 26:01.854
dead, murdered body and dumped it
in the yard like, "Here's your dog."

26:01.887 --> 26:04.823
It was defiled, just defiled.

26:04.857 --> 26:10.229
Ritualistically, like just sick. It was a
beautiful dog, it was a black lab pit-bull mix.

26:10.262 --> 26:13.199
They cut it from its neck
down to its nut sack.

26:13.232 --> 26:16.435
Turned it inside out
like an old sock butcher.

26:16.468 --> 26:18.337
- Fuck.
- And then like as a statement,

26:18.370 --> 26:21.273
- put back, "Here's your dog."
- Did they find who did it?

26:21.307 --> 26:24.009
- No.
- Does he have enemies?

26:24.043 --> 26:26.111
I don't know, man. No.

26:26.145 --> 26:28.480
- What did he do?
- He drank, man.

26:28.514 --> 26:32.117
Somebody did that, because it
felt good to do it to that person.

26:32.151 --> 26:34.119
- Did they find the person?
- No.

26:34.153 --> 26:37.189
- Oh, that's, dude, that's weird.
- Yeah.

26:37.223 --> 26:39.892
And this psycho is just running
loose in that neighborhood.

26:39.925 --> 26:42.995
We don't know, we don't know,
if he's a psycho, right.

26:43.028 --> 26:45.030
- What are you talking about?
- I mean, how do you know?

26:45.064 --> 26:48.300
- Uh, he murdered a dog and turned...
- And that's what we know.

26:50.936 --> 26:53.105
Right? It's interesting, though.

26:54.573 --> 26:55.941
Really interesting.

26:57.476 --> 27:00.546
Somebody got pleasure from doing that
from taking that dog and cutting,

27:00.579 --> 27:02.281
they did it, because
they liked it, obviously.

27:03.415 --> 27:07.019
- Oh, yeah.
- Just get the chills.

27:07.052 --> 27:11.490
There were organs where hair should have
been in hair on the inside, it was vital.

27:11.523 --> 27:12.958
All right, I'm good.

27:16.195 --> 27:19.265
- May I go watch TV now? I'm done.
- Sure, honey.

27:26.872 --> 27:28.907
I can't believe it happened
right across the street.

27:28.941 --> 27:30.442
I didn't want to bring it up
in front of Natalie.

27:30.476 --> 27:34.113
- It's horrible, poor Marney.
- Poor Bruce.

27:34.146 --> 27:35.581
That's a good thing,
we don't have a cat.

27:35.614 --> 27:38.183
Well, we do have a bird now.

27:38.217 --> 27:40.552
Either way it doesn't make it
any less terrifying,

27:40.586 --> 27:45.824
I don't want to scare you, but whatever
kid's doing this kind of stuff is a killer.

27:45.858 --> 27:46.925
You think it was a kid?

27:48.060 --> 27:51.964
A dumb, bored, psychotic
teenager with mommy issues.

27:51.997 --> 27:55.301
Kids like that always turn out to be serial
killers or like shooting up their high schools.

27:55.334 --> 27:56.235
That's what's so unnerving.

27:58.137 --> 28:00.973
- Are you worried about Natalie?
- Of course.

28:01.006 --> 28:03.842
Oh, gosh, I think we moved
to a place like this,

28:03.876 --> 28:06.879
so we can keep her in a safe environment
and something like this happens.

28:07.946 --> 28:12.051
- Why isn't anyone doing anything?
- Well, it could be anyone.

28:12.084 --> 28:14.353
The cops said
that this happened before,

28:14.386 --> 28:18.424
it just seemed to be a motive,
just senseless killing.

28:18.457 --> 28:20.259
Can we change the subject,
please?

28:20.292 --> 28:22.461
Honey, that doesn't make
things more safe.

28:22.494 --> 28:25.064
I know, but just thinking about
it makes me really scared.

28:27.399 --> 28:28.500
They'll find the guy soon.

28:30.637 --> 28:32.504
Let's just change the subject.

28:46.585 --> 28:49.355
I broke it, I broke my imported
shit, bro,.

28:49.388 --> 28:53.025
Everybody used to.

28:53.058 --> 28:55.494
Word. Like I just used to
get, "What?" that's crazy, dude.

28:55.527 --> 28:58.063
Yo, we just

28:58.097 --> 29:00.432
What is his name,.

29:00.466 --> 29:03.936
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Look, who's late.

29:03.969 --> 29:05.404
Always being late, man.

29:05.437 --> 29:08.507
Well, there's traffic.

29:08.540 --> 29:09.975
Let's get this started, dude.

29:10.008 --> 29:11.276
Let's get to the dance floor.

29:11.310 --> 29:12.645
- Get this jam session...
- Let's get it!

29:15.447 --> 29:16.982
Ah...

29:20.319 --> 29:22.087
- You ready, though?
- Yep.

29:22.121 --> 29:23.255
You ready, bro?

Yo. All right.

All right. Look sharp.

31:40.158 --> 31:41.593
- Okay.
- Here we go.

31:44.697 --> 31:45.832
Hey.

31:45.865 --> 31:47.734
- Straight to my chair.
- Hello.

31:47.767 --> 31:51.771
- Oh, hi.
- So, everybody, this is Jim.

31:51.804 --> 31:53.238
- Jim.
- How you doing, man? Graham.

31:53.272 --> 31:54.473
- Graham. Nice to meet you.
- Edy.

31:54.506 --> 31:56.208
- Edy.
- Good to meet you.

31:56.241 --> 31:59.611
- Albert.
- Albert. Come on, dawg..

31:59.646 --> 32:01.781
- Can you help me out with this?
- No, that's you.

32:03.148 --> 32:06.285
No, this is me. I'd like
to have a glass of wine.

32:06.318 --> 32:09.756
- Will you open it for me?
- Yeah, I'll see if we had a wine opener.

32:09.789 --> 32:12.157
- Yeah, you can do that.
- Yeah. Of course.

32:12.190 --> 32:14.326
So, Jim, how do you know
our dear friend, Richard?

32:14.359 --> 32:19.164
- Uh, let me guess, the bar.
- Oh, yeah. Richard's quite the drinker.

32:19.197 --> 32:22.434
That's how we know him too.
Helps us only two bars in town.

32:22.467 --> 32:24.436
There's one that the old people
go to,

32:24.469 --> 32:28.407
and the one the young people go
to, so guess which one we go to?

32:28.440 --> 32:32.244
Well, whichever one it was,
I had a surprisingly very good time.

32:32.277 --> 32:34.346
Oh, that's such a good answer.

32:34.379 --> 32:38.150
- Those old drunks talking about their shitty days.
- Not so bad.

32:38.183 --> 32:40.252
Hey, um, where'd you get that?

32:41.153 --> 32:42.220
You're looking out of bed.

32:43.221 --> 32:45.557
You think I could get
your number.

32:45.591 --> 32:47.860
So, a friend in need
is a friend indeed.

32:47.894 --> 32:49.829
- Cool.
- Got you,.

32:49.862 --> 32:52.865
Um... Yeah.

32:52.899 --> 32:57.135
How much could I get
for, uh, 20 dollars?

32:57.169 --> 32:59.772
- 20 sack double down.
- Edy. Edy.

32:59.806 --> 33:02.875
Edy. There's no wine opener.
Shit out of luck.

33:03.876 --> 33:07.847
Well, thank you very much, you invite me to
your house and you don't have a wine opener.

33:07.880 --> 33:11.450
I can open it. I could do,
I could do that actually.

33:11.483 --> 33:13.251
- You are a wine opener.
- I could do it.

33:13.285 --> 33:16.856
- Not a wine opener per se but...
- But I'll open the wine.

33:16.889 --> 33:19.692
- But, yeah, I can open the wine.
- Magic.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.795
- I know a trick.
- What's the trick?

33:22.829 --> 33:24.897
- He's good. He's good.
- He's checking the wall.

33:26.733 --> 33:28.600
What's he doing?

33:28.635 --> 33:32.437
- I believe that's your wall.
- No, no, no.

33:34.841 --> 33:36.876
Testing the boundaries.

33:36.909 --> 33:37.810
Okay.

33:40.813 --> 33:41.714
What?

33:42.782 --> 33:45.584
- Wow.
- Okay.

33:45.617 --> 33:49.221
Oh, my God. That was amazing.

33:49.254 --> 33:52.391
- You don't mind drinking it out of the mug?
- As long as it's a clean mug.

33:52.424 --> 33:56.328
- I got to learn that.
- Thank you very, very much.

33:56.361 --> 33:58.363
Ah, you got some sales,
my friend.

33:58.397 --> 33:59.766
- Thank you.
- If you weren't here,

33:59.799 --> 34:00.900
I wouldn't be able to have
glass of wine.

34:00.933 --> 34:02.334
Well, I'm glad, I'm here.

34:04.037 --> 34:08.741
Nice place you got here. I've been coming
up and down these streets past your house

34:08.775 --> 34:13.344
for I don't know how long
and I've never been inside.

34:15.014 --> 34:17.616
I don't think I've ever seen
the inside of your place.

34:18.550 --> 34:23.288
We've been neighbors for I
don't know, how many years now?

34:23.321 --> 34:24.556
Four years.

34:24.589 --> 34:25.824
You've been a good neighbor,
though.

34:27.025 --> 34:33.565
Nice, quiet,
not too much chit chat.

34:33.598 --> 34:36.668
You think one of these assholes
killed your cat?

34:41.974 --> 34:43.643
One of the other neighbors?

34:45.645 --> 34:47.446
Ah...

34:49.481 --> 34:50.382
I don't know.

34:52.018 --> 34:55.587
I just... I just still can't
believe that it happened.

34:57.489 --> 35:00.292
- Things like this never happen around here.
- Yeah.

35:01.393 --> 35:04.964
Probably one of those
sicko kids, huh?

35:05.965 --> 35:09.234
The most ornery kid I've ever met
would never do a thing like that.

35:10.670 --> 35:11.570
Fuckers!

35:19.344 --> 35:20.813
I know he's just a cat...

35:23.816 --> 35:26.786
- but he was just like family.
- Yeah, I know.

35:28.453 --> 35:32.792
You wasn't around here when
I had to put poor Charlie down.

35:35.594 --> 35:37.029
God, Ian, I'm so sorry.

35:37.964 --> 35:41.299
Yeah, I love that dog...

35:43.602 --> 35:46.271
same as you loved Bruce.

35:50.076 --> 35:51.644
After the wife died...

35:54.412 --> 35:56.615
there was nobody around
but me and Charlie.

35:58.450 --> 36:02.054
Just like it was, uh,
you and Bruce.

36:03.022 --> 36:04.791
What happened?

36:04.824 --> 36:09.095
Charlie was a Pitbull,
had a thing about him, wheels.

36:09.128 --> 36:14.566
Every time a car go by,
he started barking, run to the window.

36:17.069 --> 36:21.674
One morning, Charlie got out of the house
right when I was getting the morning paper

36:21.707 --> 36:24.944
and the shittiest thing happened
at the same time,

36:25.845 --> 36:29.782
a young girl was driving by
on her bicycle,

36:30.683 --> 36:35.822
must have been no more than seven or
eight years old, had a pink helmet.

36:36.956 --> 36:40.827
And Charlie, oh, Charlie scared
the hell out of her.

36:42.460 --> 36:45.597
They tried to say
that Charlie bit her...

36:47.133 --> 36:51.603
but I know better than that,
Charlie didn't bite anybody,

36:51.637 --> 36:53.371
I was right there
and I saw it all.

36:55.607 --> 36:58.110
But anyway,
they put pressure on me...

36:59.779 --> 37:02.982
and a week later,
I had to put Charlie down.

37:03.015 --> 37:06.152
Oh, God, Ian, no, I'm so sorry.

37:09.188 --> 37:10.488
Poor Charlie.

37:13.693 --> 37:15.393
He didn't hurt nobody, you know.

37:17.830 --> 37:21.701
You can't be nothing
but what you are.

37:27.173 --> 37:32.812
If they was going to prosecute and
persecute anybody, it should have been me.

37:32.845 --> 37:35.014
I'm the one that let him out.

37:37.984 --> 37:38.985
Poor Charlie.

37:40.119 --> 37:41.087
He's gone.

37:43.022 --> 37:45.024
I was thinking about
getting another dog.

37:46.558 --> 37:50.963
But I don't know,
I just never got around to it.

37:59.171 --> 38:00.172
Another?

38:01.473 --> 38:03.676
Sure, why not?

38:12.752 --> 38:14.754
So, Jim, did you just move here?

38:14.787 --> 38:17.589
Uh, yeah, I've been here
for like, maybe three weeks.

38:17.622 --> 38:19.025
How are you taking to it, man?

38:19.058 --> 38:20.927
- I like it.
- Yeah?

38:20.960 --> 38:24.196
I used to like the liveliness
of the city, but I'm adjusting,

38:25.164 --> 38:26.766
slowly, but surely.

38:26.799 --> 38:28.234
Yeah, that's cool, man,
you got kids?

38:28.267 --> 38:33.605
- No, yeah, one on the way.
- Oh, nice.

38:33.639 --> 38:38.110
Well, it's the burbs, man,
it's the ideal place to raise kids.

38:38.144 --> 38:43.983
- Oh, you guys have kids?
- Oh, God! No.

38:47.053 --> 38:48.486
Charlie's angels.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.189
Quite the addiction.

38:50.222 --> 38:51.924
Mmm.

38:51.958 --> 38:54.060
- It seems more like a habit.
- It's an addiction.

38:54.093 --> 38:57.096
I mean, yeah. I think
it's more like a bad habit.

38:57.129 --> 38:59.932
Yeah, it's exactly like that.

38:59.966 --> 39:02.500
For worse things, as long
as you're not hurting anyone.

39:02.534 --> 39:05.671
And I'm addicted to something far more
serious than any drug you can think of.

39:05.705 --> 39:07.740
- What's that?
- YouTube.

39:07.773 --> 39:10.009
That wine trick,
I learned that from YouTube.

39:10.042 --> 39:14.013
Oh, see, I just thought you
had that like in your back pocket.

39:14.046 --> 39:20.886
I think about my kid just being born into this
generation, that is internet all the time.

39:20.920 --> 39:23.689
I mean,
that is for his entire life.

39:23.723 --> 39:29.028
And your kid, he will never know what it's
like to not have that information, though.

39:29.061 --> 39:32.031
The kid will not know what it's
like to not know something.

39:32.064 --> 39:36.936
- Richard, no internet...
- Can you believe that?

39:36.969 --> 39:39.171
Old school like a fucker.

39:39.205 --> 39:40.973
You don't have a computer?

39:42.308 --> 39:45.543
- What will I do with a computer?
- Live.

39:47.680 --> 39:51.317
Yeah, yeah, all right,
don't get him started, don't, don't...

39:51.350 --> 39:55.587
Oh, man! Look, look, look, look,
all right, look.

39:55.620 --> 39:56.789
Oh, here he goes.

39:58.590 --> 40:04.030
That's real, the joint is real, you could touch
it, it could burn you, right, it can burn.

40:04.063 --> 40:06.165
It's real,
there's something there.

40:06.198 --> 40:09.769
The rest of this stuff is just fake
shit, there's nothing there, man.

40:09.802 --> 40:13.939
The internet, computers,
smartphones, television,

40:13.973 --> 40:17.977
it's fucked, it ruins people,
it's Luciferian.

40:21.847 --> 40:23.649
It's fun.

40:23.682 --> 40:26.018
Well, then you should find
other ways to have fun, man.

40:26.052 --> 40:28.586
- Luciferian, you said.
- Yes, it's bad.

40:28.620 --> 40:30.956
- Wow!
- Yes.

40:30.990 --> 40:35.628
So, Richard, um, what have you been doing with
yourself now that you've been unemployed,

40:35.661 --> 40:42.701
I mean, what real, real things, I
mean, real, have you been working on?

40:42.735 --> 40:46.806
- What's on the horizon?
- Presently, I've had my friends over,

40:46.839 --> 40:51.143
and we're drinking and we're smoking and we're
listening to records, you know what I mean?

40:51.177 --> 40:56.215
Okay, is that new? No, it's not
new, but it's happening, it's real.

40:56.248 --> 40:58.751
- I like it, I think it's good.
- It is good.

40:58.784 --> 41:01.053
- I will drink to that.
- Yay.

41:01.087 --> 41:05.925
- To the same old, same old.
- Same old, same old.

41:05.958 --> 41:08.661
- Cheers! Cheers! Yeah. Yeah.
- Cheers!

41:30.382 --> 41:33.819
<i>People in one
neighborhood say they are living in fear</i>

41:33.853 --> 41:36.188
<i>after two pets were killed.</i>

41:36.222 --> 41:38.991
<i>The frustration is mounting,
because no one knows who's responsible.</i>

41:39.024 --> 41:41.760
<i>One of those cats
was just...</i>

41:41.794 --> 41:45.164
<i> is that
authorities are not doing enough</i>

41:45.197 --> 41:47.399
<i>to try and catch
this pet killer,</i>

41:47.433 --> 41:51.203
<i>in the neighborhood
where the cats were found on top.</i>

44:00.966 --> 44:02.268
Hey, little guy in there.

44:04.370 --> 44:06.772
You want to hear a poem
that your mom just wrote?

44:09.475 --> 44:13.879
Just don't be too hard on me,
I haven't written anything in a long time.

44:16.949 --> 44:20.519
"No one counts the
middle child, no one misses her.

44:22.855 --> 44:24.990
I used to leave the house
at night

44:25.024 --> 44:29.061
my footsteps undetected from
my bedroom to an open field,

44:30.062 --> 44:33.932
a glow with yellow as the sun
gave up its brilliance,

44:33.966 --> 44:38.370
each day, the same soft light,
each night's distinct finale,

44:39.872 --> 44:41.840
I always left
before the darkness was complete

44:41.874 --> 44:45.210
and walked back the way I came
filled with light inside of me,

44:45.244 --> 44:47.846
one night, the sounds
of songs broken

44:48.547 --> 44:52.351
the music thrust me from my
cave of dusk into their light,

44:52.384 --> 44:56.322
the songs were warm to me
were far away yet mine,

44:56.355 --> 44:59.892
the voices in the house were filled
with laughter laced with song,

44:59.925 --> 45:01.060
melodies enveloped me,

45:02.629 --> 45:06.999
I let them fill me to the brim until the
dark was thick enough to swim through,

45:07.032 --> 45:12.071
I couldn't sing them to you now,
but I can tell you what they told me,

45:12.104 --> 45:14.606
there is so much
still unseen to you

45:14.641 --> 45:17.376
that you may watch in secret
all your days."

45:24.383 --> 45:25.451
What do you think?

45:27.486 --> 45:28.620
Too sentimental?

45:30.956 --> 45:33.225
Okay, dude, I gotta go.

45:33.258 --> 45:38.197
- Oh, no, two times,
two more tunes.

45:38.230 --> 45:40.199
- I must get going.
- Two more tunes.

45:42.034 --> 45:46.305
New guy has to dance more!
New guy has to dance more!

45:46.338 --> 45:48.941
You are such good dancers.
Just keep doing.

45:48.974 --> 45:50.242
You got to tell me something
I don't know.

45:50.275 --> 45:51.910
I got to get home.

45:51.944 --> 45:53.979
- I'll walk you out.
- Oh, come on, man.

45:54.012 --> 45:57.182
You guys, seriously, keep
dancing, you're great. I gotta go.

45:57.216 --> 45:59.585
You have to walk me,
I'm not going to have to...

46:01.387 --> 46:06.058
It's just, thank you, man,
thank you, this is great.

46:06.091 --> 46:08.527
- Dude, it was great.
- It was, man, I'm fucking...

46:08.560 --> 46:13.232
- I'm glad you got fired today.
- Me too. I like it. I like it.

46:13.265 --> 46:15.267
Yeah,
you're not going to go...

46:15.300 --> 46:17.637
- No, no, no, I'm good.
- No, listen to me,

46:17.670 --> 46:19.505
I don't want you stumbling
around out there.

46:19.538 --> 46:23.542
I am not gonna stumble.
Clearly, no. Simon Brandon

46:23.575 --> 46:27.946
I'm good, I got my shoes on.

46:27.980 --> 46:29.348
- All right.
- Okay?

46:29.381 --> 46:30.282
Yes.

46:31.550 --> 46:33.585
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you for coming.

46:33.619 --> 46:35.187
Ugh.

46:35.220 --> 46:37.122
- You're a part of the tribe now.
- Thank you.

46:37.156 --> 46:39.124
- I mean that.
- Glad to be part of it.

46:39.158 --> 46:41.260
- You're in.
- Thank you.

46:41.293 --> 46:43.663
- Yeah, man.
- Good night, Richard.

46:43.696 --> 46:44.631
Good night, man.

46:54.641 --> 46:56.141
Wait, wait, that's not the one.

46:57.176 --> 47:01.013
Hold on, wait, wait, wait,
stop, stop.

47:01.046 --> 47:03.215
Okay, this is the la...

47:03.248 --> 47:07.252
Okay, one more, one more,
one more, one more, hold on...

47:16.428 --> 47:17.329
What?

47:28.140 --> 47:29.141
Oh.

47:33.445 --> 47:38.016
Bruce was an adorable cat, and
that's coming from a dog person.

47:40.787 --> 47:43.589
- Can I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

47:45.758 --> 47:47.593
Do you want another beer?

47:47.627 --> 47:49.261
Mm?

47:49.294 --> 47:51.296
Do you want another beer?

47:54.199 --> 47:55.668
I had reached my limit.

47:56.669 --> 47:59.171
Oh, God, can I ask you
one more question?

48:00.239 --> 48:01.173
Go ahead.

48:02.608 --> 48:10.048
Why didn't you ever remarry,
or how come you never got another dog?

48:12.852 --> 48:15.120
I don't know.

48:18.390 --> 48:20.192
Things you keep putting off,
you know.

48:21.460 --> 48:23.495
I used to say to myself...

48:26.231 --> 48:27.432
I'll get around to it...

48:29.134 --> 48:33.640
but then time passes
and life passes.

48:36.174 --> 48:39.378
You just... You just never do.

48:41.346 --> 48:42.381
You know, um...

48:44.651 --> 48:47.286
You know, I came here,
because of my mom.

48:47.319 --> 48:49.254
Mm.

48:49.288 --> 48:53.760
She was in a nursing home not
far from here, she was, um...

48:56.461 --> 49:01.166
I mean, she had kind of lost it
mentally, but I guess I just wanted...

49:02.735 --> 49:07.539
I guess I just wanted to be near her,
because it was just us, there was...

49:07.573 --> 49:08.808
there was nobody else.

49:09.776 --> 49:10.677
Mm.

49:11.678 --> 49:12.578
And...

49:15.682 --> 49:18.283
Well, anyway,
she passed two years ago.

49:20.753 --> 49:25.624
And I always just thought
that I would move somewhere

49:25.658 --> 49:28.861
that I would have done
something,

49:31.496 --> 49:33.532
Oh, my God,
but I just never did.

49:36.501 --> 49:38.136
Home is home.

49:42.374 --> 49:43.275
Mm.

49:44.944 --> 49:45.845
Yeah.

49:48.547 --> 49:53.452
I guess I got comfortable here,
or I guess I like it.

49:57.255 --> 49:58.156
Uh...

49:59.591 --> 50:00.727
Home is home.

50:06.766 --> 50:11.470
You were here for your mother, when she really needed you.

50:14.506 --> 50:15.407
Think about that.

50:20.647 --> 50:22.381
My wife and I...

50:23.883 --> 50:25.384
...we never had any kids.

50:27.954 --> 50:32.224
I didn't want any, uh,
and that was okay with her.

50:35.327 --> 50:37.329
But now that
I think back on it...

50:40.565 --> 50:44.469
that was one of the biggest
mistakes I ever made in my life.

50:48.941 --> 50:54.179
You were here for your mom's
when she really needed you...

50:55.280 --> 50:56.348
Think about that.

51:24.276 --> 51:25.210
Ian...

51:26.813 --> 51:27.747
Mmm?

51:29.581 --> 51:31.583
I think I'll go to bed now.

51:36.989 --> 51:38.891
You can come with me. I mean...

51:41.928 --> 51:44.664
I mean, you can come with me,
if you want the company.

51:49.936 --> 51:50.837
Okay?

51:53.673 --> 51:55.273
I think I want the company.

52:05.885 --> 52:08.654
- It's late, we got to go.
- I know,

52:08.688 --> 52:09.722
but just a little bit more.

52:14.994 --> 52:16.696
Let's finally do it.

52:16.729 --> 52:19.699
- Not tonight.
- I know.

52:19.732 --> 52:21.701
- Soon.
- Yeah.

52:28.440 --> 52:29.642
- Not tonight.
- I know.

52:30.542 --> 52:31.443
I know.

52:32.477 --> 52:33.880
Hey.

52:38.383 --> 52:40.787
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

52:40.820 --> 52:42.621
He's hammered.

52:45.423 --> 52:50.362
- All right, I'll gonna go.
- Okay, oh, have a good night.

52:50.395 --> 52:52.330
- Okay.
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

52:55.968 --> 52:57.770
- Be careful, bye.
- Yeah.

53:48.486 --> 53:49.387
Hey.

53:51.423 --> 53:53.960
- Hey.
- What?

53:55.628 --> 53:57.362
I think there's someone
in the kitchen?

53:58.798 --> 54:00.465
What do you mean?

54:03.769 --> 54:05.972
I think there's someone
out there.

54:06.005 --> 54:08.406
It could be Natalie.

54:08.440 --> 54:10.142
Or it can be the fucking
pet killer, you idiot.

54:14.013 --> 54:16.448
Go to Natalie's room right now,
call 911.

54:25.958 --> 54:27.492
Get there.

54:37.637 --> 54:38.838
Hey!

54:38.871 --> 54:41.908
Oh, fuck.
Sorry, man, wrong house.

54:43.643 --> 54:46.511
- Get out of here.
- I'm going.

54:46.544 --> 54:47.813
- It's okay.
- Out.

54:47.847 --> 54:49.782
- Hey, easy, man.
- Sue, call the police.

54:49.815 --> 54:51.884
-Don't do that, I'm leaving.

54:51.918 --> 54:54.687
- Are you the guy killing people's pets?
- What are you talking about?

54:54.720 --> 54:56.889
What are you doing breaking into
other people's fucking house?

54:56.923 --> 54:58.190
I am not breaking,
it's an accident, man.

54:58.224 --> 55:01.526
You're staying
until the cops come.

55:01.559 --> 55:05.097
- Stop.
- You just stop, man.

55:05.131 --> 55:06.464
Are you crazy?

55:16.042 --> 55:17.043
You stabbed me.

55:18.576 --> 55:21.948
Sue, get in here,
keep Natalie in the room.

55:21.981 --> 55:25.851
Listen to me, my wife's a nurse,
so just keep calm.

55:28.154 --> 55:29.822
- Who is he?
- Why did you stab me?

55:29.855 --> 55:30.890
I... don't know.

55:30.923 --> 55:32.624
What the fuck did you do?

55:33.693 --> 55:35.962
- It was an accident.
- Jesus.

55:35.995 --> 55:39.865
Okay, listen to me, I just called 911,
someone is on their way, stay calm.

56:46.265 --> 56:47.166
Pss-pss.

57:19.265 --> 57:20.565
Pss-pss.

57:24.336 --> 57:26.672
Pss-pss. Pss-pss.

59:17.316 --> 59:21.320
Marney,
I know this sounds strange...

59:23.389 --> 59:27.259
and I really don't understand it
myself.

59:30.162 --> 59:31.830
But after last night...

59:34.833 --> 59:37.069
something came over me and...

59:38.470 --> 59:40.472
I can't even put it in words.

59:44.276 --> 59:49.848
But it just put me
in another place.

59:51.450 --> 59:57.256
I see you coming
and going all the time...

59:58.958 --> 01:00:04.163
and that feeling has probably
been with me all that time.

01:00:07.299 --> 01:00:08.300
I'm in love.

01:00:12.171 --> 01:00:13.305
That's all I can say.

01:00:35.327 --> 01:00:37.196
Marney.

01:00:37.229 --> 01:00:39.431
- Morning, Ian.
- There's something I got to tell you.

01:00:39.465 --> 01:00:44.270
Look, I, uh, I wasn't really
in my right mind last night,

01:00:45.304 --> 01:00:50.109
there's a lot of things going on
up there, so see you around.

01:01:14.967 --> 01:01:16.368
See you around.

01:01:25.411 --> 01:01:27.212
I got myself into this mess.

01:01:59.278 --> 01:02:02.948
- Okay, okay, okay, cool.
- Breakfast.

01:02:02.981 --> 01:02:05.017
We need to go.

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:08.320
- When did you get up?
- Oh, yes, but I'll split.

01:02:08.354 --> 01:02:09.588
- I got to go.
- Why?

01:02:09.621 --> 01:02:12.091
Uh, 'cause it's time.

01:02:12.124 --> 01:02:13.959
It's time, you don't even
know what time it is.

01:02:13.992 --> 01:02:16.061
- Yeah.
- It's breakfast time.

01:02:16.095 --> 01:02:18.097
- Have some breakfast.
- All right.

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:21.233
A little touch of eggs and bacon
on me to feel.

01:02:21.266 --> 01:02:23.636
Well, that was very nice,
but we're done.

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:26.572
- I would have better...
- Come on.

01:02:26.605 --> 01:02:28.240
It smells good,
you're a good host.

01:02:28.273 --> 01:02:32.277
- All right.
- School day.

01:02:32.311 --> 01:02:33.979
- School day.
- Yeah, I know.

01:02:34.012 --> 01:02:35.414
Come on, man, that's so nice.

01:02:35.447 --> 01:02:37.216
This is my fucking mom, dude.

01:02:37.249 --> 01:02:42.154
- Mom, mom, mom, see you.
- What does that even mean, man?

01:03:04.476 --> 01:03:06.178
Do you have any idea
how lucky you are?

01:03:09.114 --> 01:03:11.316
That knife didn't slice
your liver open...

01:03:12.719 --> 01:03:14.953
and the nurse was able
to stop your bleeding.

01:03:19.759 --> 01:03:21.527
Bought a bag of weed last night.

01:03:23.028 --> 01:03:25.164
Oh, very cool.

01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:31.437
You'll need to start to act to your
age, I know that sounds really dull,

01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:33.172
but you're gonna be a dad
any day now.

01:03:37.142 --> 01:03:40.245
I know. I'm sorry.

01:03:54.026 --> 01:03:55.160
Did you ever go out last night?

01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:01.066
- No.
- Why not?

01:04:02.401 --> 01:04:04.136
Stayed home playing video games.

01:04:05.772 --> 01:04:09.341
I was going to go out, but my legs were
too tired, it would be nice.

01:04:20.753 --> 01:04:22.387
So did you see the news
this morning, dude?

01:04:25.357 --> 01:04:27.025
No.

01:04:27.059 --> 01:04:29.796
It was weird, it was like,
this guy was like...

01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:35.334
They named him like, the pet killer and
I guess he was killing pets or whatever,

01:04:35.367 --> 01:04:39.238
and he got caught, somebody
beat him up or something.

01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:44.042
It was weird, I never seen
anything like that.

01:04:47.179 --> 01:04:49.348
- You didn't hear about it?
- No.

01:04:57.824 --> 01:05:01.159
<i>Early this morning,
a man in his late 30s was found dead</i>

01:05:01.193 --> 01:05:03.830
<i>on the sidewalk
of Willow Glen Drive,</i>

01:05:03.863 --> 01:05:07.700
<i>authorities say he could be related to the
string of pet slangs in the neighborhood,</i>

01:05:07.734 --> 01:05:10.703
<i>as a bloody pocket knife
was discovered in his jacket.</i>

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.548
How's it going?

01:05:31.223 --> 01:05:35.662
- Can I go out now?
- Yeah, honey, it's all good.

01:05:39.866 --> 01:05:40.767
Hey.

01:05:43.335 --> 01:05:46.572
- So, have you guys decided?
- Decided what, honey?

01:05:47.506 --> 01:05:48.641
Where we'll keep Polly?

01:05:53.512 --> 01:05:55.380
We'll put her right next
to the window here.

01:05:56.615 --> 01:06:00.352
That way, she can look outside,
but still be safe inside.

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:29.481
Good morning.

01:06:32.919 --> 01:06:34.419
Nice day, huh?
