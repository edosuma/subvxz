00:09.500 --> 00:12.208
(male announcer)
'This is a near-capacity
crowd'

00:12.291 --> 00:15.583
at Fishtown Gardens tonight.

00:15.667 --> 00:19.375
'Dock Rats taking on the
Manayunk Chieftains at home.'

00:19.458 --> 00:20.792
'Vicious rivalry.'

00:20.875 --> 00:23.125
'Lots of blood on the ice
tonight, two periods'

00:23.208 --> 00:25.583
of nonstop mayhem.

00:27.041 --> 00:29.917
'Deep in the third period
Chieftains 4-2.'

00:30.000 --> 00:32.333
'Dock Rats feeling the pain.'

00:32.417 --> 00:33.667
Alright,
Flanagan,
get in there.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.250
- Try not to get hurt.
- Okay, coach.

00:35.333 --> 00:36.583
(male announcer)
'Shorthanded Dock Rats'

00:36.667 --> 00:40.083
'subbing in Little Tommy
Flanagan at the point.'

00:40.166 --> 00:42.375
'Stickhandling up
to the hash marks.'

00:42.458 --> 00:45.417
Oh!
He just nailed
him!

00:45.500 --> 00:48.375
Stay down, you little
pygmy!
Next time, it's your
head!

00:48.458 --> 00:50.625
(male announcer)
'Masters all over Flanagan!'

00:50.709 --> 00:53.625
'Yet another penalty
on the Chieftains.'

00:53.709 --> 00:56.291
'Cross-checking two more
minutes in the sin bin'

00:56.375 --> 00:58.000
'for Cullen Masters.'

01:07.500 --> 01:09.792
'Flanagan with a breakaway
on the power play'

01:09.875 --> 01:11.500
'all alone at the point!'

01:11.583 --> 01:15.333
'Chance the Dock Rats have
been fighting for all night.'

01:15.417 --> 01:17.959
'Is this Flanagan's moment?'

01:19.375 --> 01:21.208
'He shoots!'

01:21.291 --> 01:26.000
'No! That's a scoring
opportunity denied.'

01:26.083 --> 01:28.667
Flanagan! Get your
bony ass over here!

01:29.959 --> 01:33.417
Wide open goal,
uh, rookie
mistake

01:35.041 --> 01:37.333
What the hell were you
thinking
slap shot that close in?

01:37.417 --> 01:38.667
Get your head in the game!

01:38.750 --> 01:40.917
I'm sorry, coach.
It won't happen
again.

01:54.625 --> 01:57.667
(male announcer on TV)
President Carter greeting
the US Miracle Hockey Team

01:57.750 --> 01:59.667
'at the White House
today following their'

01:59.750 --> 02:02.458
'incredible upset victory
leading to a gold medal'

02:02.542 --> 02:04.750
'over the heavily
favored Russians.'

02:13.625 --> 02:15.208
Cullen Masters.

02:15.291 --> 02:17.792
- You ever heard of the guy?
- Who'd he play for?

02:17.875 --> 02:19.625
Manayunk Chieftains.

02:19.709 --> 02:21.750
Atlantic Seaboard
Hockey Conference.

02:21.834 --> 02:25.291
Bush-league, folded in
'81.
What's his story?

02:25.375 --> 02:27.542
Well, charged
for a murder in 1980.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.542
A hockey player
named Tommy Flanagan

02:29.625 --> 02:31.458
played for the
Fishtown Dock Rats.

02:31.542 --> 02:32.792
Killed on the ice.

02:32.875 --> 02:34.583
"Opposing defenseman,
booted out of the game

02:34.667 --> 02:36.333
threatens to kill the
kid
in front of
witnesses."

02:36.417 --> 02:38.625
(Rush)
'Yeah, Tommy's blood on
his jersey, no alibi.'

02:38.709 --> 02:41.875
Arrested him, but
the DA dropped charges.

02:41.959 --> 02:44.000
So what, is he
here to
confess?

02:47.542 --> 02:48.959
Skated on this
murder once
already.

02:49.041 --> 02:50.917
You sure you wanna
try your luck again?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.041
[sighs]
The night the U.S. hockey team

02:53.125 --> 02:54.583
beats the Russians
in the Olympics..

02:54.667 --> 02:57.792
Miracle on Ice,
my life goes to hell.

02:57.875 --> 03:00.458
February 22, the
night
Tommy was killed?

03:00.542 --> 03:02.333
Punk on a rival team
kept getting in my face.

03:02.417 --> 03:04.500
He was five,
five,
a buck-fifty.

03:04.583 --> 03:05.917
You outweighed him
by what, 70 pounds?

03:06.000 --> 03:07.625
The kid didn't
know when to quit.

03:07.709 --> 03:08.792
You know, you don't not make

03:08.875 --> 03:10.417
much of a case for
your innocence
here.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.041
Tommy got me kicked out
of the game that day.

03:13.125 --> 03:15.083
I made a few threats.

03:15.166 --> 03:17.792
You said you were
gonna cave his head
in.

03:17.875 --> 03:19.208
Pretty specific.

03:22.583 --> 03:24.750
[sighs]
That night the U.S. won

03:24.834 --> 03:26.750
hockey players
were like Gods.

03:26.834 --> 03:28.083
Women were going nuts.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.917
- Even a goon like me.
- Saying you got lucky?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.917
College girl from Spokane.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.125
Brenda something.

03:34.208 --> 03:36.458
Spent the night
in the back of her Pinto.

03:36.542 --> 03:39.125
Next morning,
she splits.

03:39.208 --> 03:40.750
Tommy turns up dead.

03:40.834 --> 03:42.291
And you're on
the hook for
murder.

03:42.375 --> 03:44.166
Never went to trial,
but it didn't matter.

03:44.250 --> 03:46.458
Everybody was sure
it was me

03:46.542 --> 03:48.125
wouldn't let me
live it down.

03:49.750 --> 03:53.500
Look, I messed
a lot of things up.

03:53.583 --> 03:55.959
This is the only thing
I ever did right.

03:56.041 --> 03:59.667
My boy, Jason.
He's 11 now.

03:59.750 --> 04:02.875
He wants to play hockey.
I sign him up.

04:02.959 --> 04:04.625
Junior league
asked me to leave.

04:04.709 --> 04:07.417
Won't let him play 'cause
of what they say I did.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.375
It broke his heart.

04:09.458 --> 04:10.667
Well, there's always soccer.

04:12.250 --> 04:15.250
Sad kid ain't reason enough
to reopen a murder case.

04:15.333 --> 04:17.834
I kept searching for
the girl from that night.

04:17.917 --> 04:19.750
Internet, even hired a PI.

04:19.834 --> 04:21.750
This "Backseat Brenda"?

04:21.834 --> 04:24.959
Lives in Maine.
Married, got kids.

04:25.041 --> 04:26.333
Not too happy
about the phone call

04:26.417 --> 04:28.750
but she'll vouch for me
for that night.

04:28.834 --> 04:33.041
- Hmm, Brenda Patterson.
- Look at the file.

04:33.125 --> 04:36.000
Pull the record,
wasn't my stick killed him.

04:36.083 --> 04:40.083
Whoever took Tommy Flanagan's
life is still out there.

04:40.166 --> 04:44.166
You find him, maybe my son

04:44.250 --> 04:46.125
gets to believe
in his dad again.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.208
Checked on Masters' story
with Brenda from Bangor.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.291
Confirmed his alibi.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.083
Still trying to shake
the image of that man

05:36.166 --> 05:37.375
in the
backseat
of a Pinto

05:37.458 --> 05:38.583
So is she.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.375
Country was taking it
on the chin in '80

05:40.458 --> 05:43.291
hostages in Iran,
Soviets in Afghanistan

05:43.375 --> 05:44.458
double-digit inflation.

05:44.542 --> 05:46.250
Uh-huh

05:46.333 --> 05:48.917
and then there
was Miracle on Ice.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.583
David takes on Goliath,
and we come out with a win.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.875
We sent amateur kids,
they sent pros.

05:53.959 --> 05:55.959
Country got some
of its pride back.

05:56.041 --> 05:58.041
Yeah, minor leagues
like the one Tommy was in

05:58.125 --> 05:59.583
came and went
in the '70s and '80s.

05:59.667 --> 06:02.875
Rough trade. Aggressive hockey,
lots of fights.

06:02.959 --> 06:04.834
(Miller)
'This kid a little
small for that bunch?'

06:04.917 --> 06:07.458
Little guys scrap
until they're hamburger.

06:07.542 --> 06:11.417
Dougie Gilmour, Theo Fleury
in the punch-out in Piestany.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.500
Nigel Dawes.

06:12.583 --> 06:15.166
- Ranger?
- Screw that guy.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.458
What'd the DA's
office have to say

06:16.542 --> 06:18.542
about dropping
the case in '80?

06:18.625 --> 06:22.208
Evidence against Masters
was circumstantial,
hearsay.

06:22.291 --> 06:23.375
Thirty-six hours
in interrogation

06:23.458 --> 06:24.834
guy wouldn't crack.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.125
Needed a confession
on a case like this

06:26.208 --> 06:27.625
and they weren't getting it.

06:27.709 --> 06:30.709
This murder happened
late.
After the Olympic game.

06:30.792 --> 06:32.291
What's this kid doing
at the rink that hour?

06:32.375 --> 06:34.250
Somebody had to have
access, let him in.

06:34.333 --> 06:36.417
Coach, janitors,
Zamboni guy.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.291
Let's talk to them again,
see if their stories

06:38.375 --> 06:40.834
still hold up, find out
who else could've had a key.

06:40.917 --> 06:43.125
Took his first hit in front
of the players' bench

06:43.208 --> 06:44.417
shattered the stick.

06:44.500 --> 06:48.083
Couldn't get a clean print
off the murder weapon.

06:48.166 --> 06:51.583
Sverre..
Brand's Norwegian.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.166
Nice gear.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.083
That's a customized
hand-carved piece of wood.

06:55.166 --> 06:57.125
Masters said
it wasn't his
stick.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.917
Cops never figured out
whose it was.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.458
I'll run it through CSU.

07:00.542 --> 07:01.792
See if we can get DNA.

07:01.875 --> 07:03.542
Well, Tommy's
older brother, Sean

07:03.625 --> 07:05.834
was pretty hot at Masters
after he got off.

07:05.917 --> 07:08.125
- Hassled him for months.
- Let's talk to him first.

07:08.208 --> 07:10.125
See what he knows
about this lumber.

07:11.709 --> 07:13.834
Rangers.

07:13.917 --> 07:16.542
So, um...you find
out
about this weekend?

07:16.625 --> 07:19.792
Yeah, Veronica's
got a thing at school.

07:19.875 --> 07:21.083
How about Tuesday?

07:21.166 --> 07:22.667
CLE review.

07:22.750 --> 07:24.542
I think I'm
supposed
to teach it.

07:24.625 --> 07:25.750
I'll try to cancel.

07:25.834 --> 07:27.000
No.

07:27.083 --> 07:29.083
I can try to get a sitter.

07:29.166 --> 07:31.500
Maybe...Thursday?

07:31.583 --> 07:33.417
My favorite day.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.417
Pick me up at 8:00.

07:36.792 --> 07:38.834
Trying to tell me that
meat head son of a
bitch

07:38.917 --> 07:40.375
wasn't the one
who killed him?

07:40.458 --> 07:43.542
Just asking if you know anybody
else had it in for Tommy?

07:43.625 --> 07:45.000
Me and my brother
weren't real
close.

07:45.083 --> 07:48.667
We ran in different
circles, you know?

07:48.750 --> 07:50.834
This is the stick
that killed your brother.

07:50.917 --> 07:52.208
Recognize it?

07:53.333 --> 07:54.667
No.

07:56.125 --> 07:59.000
Asked me that back in '80.
It's, uh, high-end stuff.

07:59.083 --> 08:02.166
It's got a really
nice
curve at the toe.

08:02.250 --> 08:05.417
- Sound like you know the game.
- Played center in high school.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.542
Got blindsided
on a motorcycle

08:07.625 --> 08:11.041
and...messed my leg up
and that was that.

08:11.125 --> 08:14.458
'Ma was sick.
Tommy was kind of a lay-about.'

08:14.542 --> 08:17.542
So someone had
to pick up the
slack.

08:17.625 --> 08:19.041
So how'd Tommy
get into playing?

08:19.125 --> 08:21.125
Economy's in the
crapper and no
jobs.

08:21.208 --> 08:22.792
Local leagues spring up

08:22.875 --> 08:25.959
started tossing pennies
to anyone who'd take a
hit.

08:26.041 --> 08:27.333
Fight club on skates.

08:27.417 --> 08:29.083
Tommy wasn't really
cut out for it.

08:29.166 --> 08:31.000
I tried to warn him, but..

08:41.250 --> 08:42.667
Try this.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.709
Good, right?

08:48.792 --> 08:50.750
Chicks love the sugar.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.083
They can't
taste
the alcohol,
till..

08:53.166 --> 08:55.250
..."Bam" it just hits 'em.

08:55.333 --> 08:58.792
I don't know.
I mean, what do I say?

08:58.875 --> 09:01.458
Don't gotta say nothing,
that's the beauty of it.

09:01.542 --> 09:05.875
Listen, all else fails,
pick up a case of
Schenkers.

09:05.959 --> 09:08.750
Get enough of that Schuylkill
swill in 'em, they can't say
no.

09:08.834 --> 09:11.500
- You are sick, you know that?
- Ow!

09:11.583 --> 09:14.125
Will you two Mary's
keep your voices down?

09:14.208 --> 09:15.375
You're gonna wake up ma.

09:16.917 --> 09:18.333
Tell him, LT.

09:20.542 --> 09:22.750
Dock Rats are holding
open tryouts Tuesday.

09:22.834 --> 09:24.625
Little Tommy's
gonna
get on the ice.

09:24.709 --> 09:26.458
Now, get serious, Tommy.

09:26.542 --> 09:27.667
What're you gonna
hit them with, huh?

09:27.750 --> 09:28.792
Elfin magic?

09:30.792 --> 09:32.500
That's better than just
giving up like you did.

09:35.125 --> 09:37.667
(Sean)
'Are you trying to be funny?'

09:38.792 --> 09:40.083
Look at you..

09:40.166 --> 09:41.750
...a love tap like that
puts you on your ass

09:41.834 --> 09:45.000
but you're gonna go play
league
hockey with these animals?

09:45.083 --> 09:46.500
'Dock Rats is
no place for you.'

09:46.583 --> 09:49.291
It's just a goon squad
looking for cannon fodder

09:49.375 --> 09:51.333
to draw penalties.

09:51.417 --> 09:52.583
You're too little, bro.

09:52.667 --> 09:55.709
- So hit me again, Sean.
- Tommy..

09:55.792 --> 09:57.792
You know I can take
anything you dish
out.

09:57.875 --> 09:59.709
'Cause I'm still a Flanagan.

10:02.417 --> 10:05.375
I don't know what got into
him,
but he took it real serious.

10:05.458 --> 10:07.667
Any idea what he was doing
on the ice that night?

10:07.750 --> 10:09.125
I don't know,
practicing,
maybe.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.333
How'd he get into
the rink that late?

10:11.417 --> 10:13.750
Tommy's idiot friend, Dwight.

10:13.834 --> 10:15.250
Two of them were
a regular Frick and
Frack.

10:15.333 --> 10:16.875
Dwight had a key made

10:16.959 --> 10:19.417
so he could play
Asteroids
in the lobby all night.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.125
He try out for
the Dock Rats, too?

10:21.208 --> 10:23.083
Dwight? Please.

10:23.166 --> 10:25.375
Ma on her deathbed
ran a quicker 40.

10:25.458 --> 10:29.250
Closest he ever got was
dealing pot to the team.

10:37.917 --> 10:39.083
Hey, buddy!

10:39.166 --> 10:40.792
You want to pay for
that
thing now that you got

10:40.875 --> 10:42.792
the pages all sticky?

10:42.875 --> 10:45.250
Magazine racket ain't
what it used to be, huh?

10:45.333 --> 10:46.792
The frickin' internet.

10:46.875 --> 10:50.083
Everybody thinks they
can
get their jollies for
free.

10:50.166 --> 10:52.583
Well, what can I do
for you, blue eyes?

10:52.667 --> 10:54.917
Tommy Flanagan.
Remember him?

10:55.000 --> 10:57.083
Sure, Tommy was my boy.

10:57.166 --> 10:58.834
Buds since the third grade.

10:58.917 --> 11:02.875
Lost my best friend the night
that Masters tool took him
out.

11:02.959 --> 11:05.750
- And where were you?
- Driving a snowplow.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.750
There was a big
storm that night.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.458
I was clearing
parking lots till dawn.

11:10.542 --> 11:12.625
Anybody else come to mind
have a beef with Tommy?

11:12.709 --> 11:14.583
You saying Masters
didn't do it?

11:14.667 --> 11:16.709
Saying we're looking into it.

11:16.792 --> 11:18.333
Answer the question.

11:18.417 --> 11:20.917
Could've been any one
of those guys on the team.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.875
My stupid idea, him trying
out for those bunch of thugs.

11:23.959 --> 11:26.667
And you'd know,
dealing weed and pills to
them.

11:26.750 --> 11:29.917
Whoa, wait. You know,
so I did a little business.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I mean, come on,
the economy sucked.

11:32.083 --> 11:34.250
You had your own
key to the place.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.583
- Come and go as you pleased.
- So did half the team.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.041
Let me tell you something.

11:38.125 --> 11:40.375
Those characters
were marginal to begin with.

11:40.458 --> 11:42.083
And everybody likes an underdog

11:42.166 --> 11:44.083
until he starts
making them look bad.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.583
(Dwight)
'Let's go, Tommy!'

11:48.667 --> 11:51.625
That's my boy out there,
in the blue. See him?

11:54.250 --> 11:55.500
Little Tommy.

11:55.583 --> 11:57.041
The shrimpy guy?

11:57.125 --> 11:58.917
[laughing]
I thought he was a mascot.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.542
Check out Charlie Hustle.

12:03.625 --> 12:05.917
Scrub with the shiny,
new skates.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.250
Nice gear, little man!

12:12.333 --> 12:13.834
That necklace is beautiful.

12:13.917 --> 12:15.875
What is that, lapis?

12:15.959 --> 12:17.625
Matches your eyes.

12:17.709 --> 12:21.959
Say, you two ever
do any modeling?

12:26.500 --> 12:28.583
Whoops, there they go!

12:29.792 --> 12:31.542
Hit him, Tommy!

12:38.542 --> 12:39.667
'Hey, that's enough!'

12:39.750 --> 12:41.500
That's enough!
Come on!

12:41.583 --> 12:42.917
That's enough!

12:43.000 --> 12:44.542
That's enough!
Hey! Hey!

12:44.625 --> 12:45.917
You got my attention.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.583
Krause, hit the showers.

12:47.667 --> 12:48.625
Hit the showers!

12:49.917 --> 12:52.208
Get done,
see me in my office.

13:05.750 --> 13:08.208
They all said
Little T pushed too hard.

13:08.291 --> 13:10.000
He never knew
when to dial it back.

13:10.083 --> 13:12.750
The ass-clown who picked
the fight, he get cut?

13:12.834 --> 13:14.166
Krause.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.917
[scoffs]
He was too old to be
taking the kind of hits

13:17.000 --> 13:18.375
that league dished out.

13:18.458 --> 13:20.208
Always shying away
at the boards.

13:20.291 --> 13:21.709
Coach put him out to pasture.

13:21.792 --> 13:24.750
Yeah, and he gave Tommy
his spot on the line.

13:24.834 --> 13:26.208
Krause, you know, he..

13:26.291 --> 13:28.375
...he asked the coach
for, like, an assistant job

13:28.458 --> 13:30.959
but he had to settle
for equipment manager.

13:31.041 --> 13:33.458
So his job to order
the sticks for the team?

13:33.542 --> 13:35.166
Messed with Tommy's gear, too.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.083
Dropped his helmet
in the John one time.

13:38.166 --> 13:40.041
The cops talked
to you back in '80

13:40.125 --> 13:41.709
never thought to mention this?

13:41.792 --> 13:43.208
They never asked.

13:43.291 --> 13:46.500
And with a scumbag
like Masters on the hook..

13:46.583 --> 13:47.792
...who's gonna listen?

14:00.583 --> 14:01.917
Ladies are bringing it!

14:02.000 --> 14:04.917
Yeah, we got a shot at
Division II
championship.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.750
Work 'em harder, see if
they want it bad enough.

14:06.834 --> 14:08.625
(Miller)
'Work harder?'

14:08.709 --> 14:11.458
Sounds like something
Tommy Flanagan might have said.

14:11.542 --> 14:12.750
Kid ever give you
trouble, Krause?

14:12.834 --> 14:14.208
Tommy? Nah.

14:14.291 --> 14:17.583
We heard he took your spot
after you went to seed.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.834
Little guy had no business out
there, but he played hard

14:19.917 --> 14:22.250
he sucked it up,
left it all on the ice.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.083
- Sounds like you respected
him.
- I did.

14:24.166 --> 14:27.583
That's why you dropped a deuce
in his helmet back in '80?

14:27.667 --> 14:30.250
We all hazed Tommy.
It wasn't personal.

14:31.792 --> 14:32.875
Recognize this stick?

14:34.166 --> 14:36.000
Yeah. Sverre.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.125
Too rich for that
bunch of gorillas.

14:37.208 --> 14:38.542
We used Koho 310's.

14:38.625 --> 14:41.458
- Ever see Tommy with it?
- Not as I recall.

14:41.542 --> 14:44.375
Look...Tommy wasn't
the one we hated.

14:44.458 --> 14:47.041
Team had a common enemy,
it was Coach Heaton.

14:51.792 --> 14:53.500
Again!

15:07.333 --> 15:10.417
Come on! Again!

15:19.917 --> 15:22.166
Pathetic!

15:22.250 --> 15:26.834
You think that weak-ass try
will
hold up against Pittsburgh?

15:26.917 --> 15:28.458
Bunch of murderers..

15:28.542 --> 15:31.333
Gonna chew you up
and spit you out.

15:31.417 --> 15:35.875
Flanagan the only one with
legs
that can finish that drill?

15:35.959 --> 15:37.583
He's half your size

15:37.667 --> 15:41.792
but he's got more heart
than any three of you pansies.

15:41.875 --> 15:45.500
'I'm not gonna come out
here and waste my time'

15:45.583 --> 15:47.417
'if you're not gonna bring
your A game to the ice!'

15:49.709 --> 15:51.333
'Do you hear me!'

15:53.250 --> 15:56.208
Flanagan!

15:56.291 --> 15:58.000
What the hell
are you staring at?

15:58.083 --> 16:00.625
Uh...nothing, coach.

16:00.709 --> 16:01.792
'Sorry.'

16:03.959 --> 16:05.583
All heart, no skill.

16:05.667 --> 16:07.542
All legs, no ability.

16:07.625 --> 16:08.959
You know what that is?

16:09.041 --> 16:12.542
That's a one-way ticket
to craptown, son.

16:12.625 --> 16:15.542
You just earned
the team another round.

16:15.625 --> 16:18.875
On your feet!
Again!

16:24.834 --> 16:26.083
Heaton was a sadist.

16:26.166 --> 16:27.542
Played guys hurt,
burned them out

16:27.625 --> 16:30.083
no mercy,
like he got off on it.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.750
What about this girl
in the stands?

16:31.834 --> 16:34.792
Guys called her Jailbait
Molly,
coach's daughter.

16:34.875 --> 16:36.166
Strictly off limits.

16:36.250 --> 16:39.542
You ever see Tommy and this
Jailbait Molly together?

16:39.625 --> 16:42.750
Yeah, once or twice,
chatting it up.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.375
Looked kind of cozy to me.

16:46.250 --> 16:48.750
(Krause)
'Let's go, Julie!
Come on! That's it!'

16:49.542 --> 16:51.750
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:51.834 --> 16:55.458
So, um, I got the sitter for
Veronica on Thursday, we're
set.

16:55.542 --> 16:58.333
Uh, I-I thought
you said Tuesday.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.458
Thursday.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.709
Your favorite day?

17:03.792 --> 17:04.875
[sighs]
Curtis..

17:04.959 --> 17:07.000
Let me call my sitter,
maybe switch.

17:07.083 --> 17:08.750
No, it's okay.

17:08.834 --> 17:10.458
I'm busy, you're busy.

17:10.542 --> 17:12.709
It's like pulling teeth
getting a few minutes
alone.

17:12.792 --> 17:14.583
Yeah. Hello?

17:14.667 --> 17:16.792
Oh. Hang on.
No, not you.

17:16.875 --> 17:18.166
No, no, this
is
a great time.

17:19.625 --> 17:21.542
Sorry.

17:21.625 --> 17:24.125
CSU got nothing
off the stick.

17:24.208 --> 17:27.125
No DNA other than
Flanagan's blood.

17:27.208 --> 17:28.959
Sverre went out of
business in the
'90s

17:29.041 --> 17:31.041
composite sticks
started taking
over.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.959
Hundred-dollar sticks
were big bucks in 1980.

17:34.041 --> 17:35.417
I'm gonna round up
local hockey teams

17:35.500 --> 17:36.959
see who was rocking
custom lumber.

17:37.041 --> 17:39.834
Well, Heaton's coaching
the Jacksonville
Manatees

17:39.917 --> 17:41.959
an away game in Trenton.

17:42.041 --> 17:43.417
Big-time hockey there.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.709
Said he was meeting
with the team owner

17:45.792 --> 17:47.583
the night of Tommy's
murder.
Checking it out.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.208
Well, Rush's got
his daughter Molly

17:49.291 --> 17:52.083
in the boss's office, gonna see
what she and Tommy had going on.

17:55.500 --> 17:58.208
The 229 background
you filled out

17:58.291 --> 17:59.583
that's a lot of
schools, Molly.

17:59.667 --> 18:00.875
Move around
a lot as a
kid?

18:00.959 --> 18:02.458
Hockey brat.

18:02.542 --> 18:05.458
Dad was always on the road,
from team to team.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.709
Stayed in Philly to graduate,
never left.

18:07.792 --> 18:08.834
All my friends were here.

18:08.917 --> 18:11.834
All your friends,
like Tommy Flanagan?

18:11.917 --> 18:13.250
What do you mean?

18:13.333 --> 18:16.834
Well, you two,
you
know...close?

18:18.750 --> 18:20.458
I didn't date hockey players.

18:20.542 --> 18:23.875
Well, teammates said, you two
were making eyes at the rink.

18:23.959 --> 18:25.583
Your father have
a problem with that?

18:25.667 --> 18:27.542
It was fine for him
to be out on the
road

18:27.625 --> 18:29.583
Three hundred days a year
with those idiots

18:29.667 --> 18:32.583
but God forbid one of them
holds the door open for me.

18:32.667 --> 18:35.166
- His way of looking out?
- I don't know.

18:35.250 --> 18:38.041
Never was easy to read
the guy, gave up trying.

18:38.125 --> 18:39.709
Think he was hard
on his players?

18:39.792 --> 18:41.625
Try being his daughter.

18:41.709 --> 18:44.000
Any reason he'd be
especially hard on Tommy?

18:44.083 --> 18:46.125
Look, he was cute

18:46.208 --> 18:48.250
but dad didn't have
anything to worry about.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.583
Tommy was focused
on the game.

18:50.667 --> 18:54.417
Besides, he had enough problems
without me adding to them.

19:08.792 --> 19:09.625
Hey, Molly!

19:13.375 --> 19:15.291
Slap shot's coming along.

19:15.375 --> 19:18.083
Yeah, I'm not sure your dad
would say the same thing.

19:18.166 --> 19:19.542
You're still here, aren't you?

19:19.625 --> 19:21.250
Yeah, what's left of me.

19:23.875 --> 19:26.291
I don't really know
what I'm doing out here.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.417
Logging all these hours.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.000
I don't know if
I'll ever be any good.

19:30.083 --> 19:32.667
Yeah, you should
probably quit.

19:35.291 --> 19:37.125
Yeah. Maybe.

19:39.917 --> 19:42.166
Are you going to that
New Year's Eve party

19:42.250 --> 19:44.458
uh, over on Cumberland?

19:44.542 --> 19:47.166
Thinking about
it.
Why?

19:47.250 --> 19:50.125
Oh, no, I was
just, just...wondering

19:50.208 --> 19:52.083
maybe...maybe..

19:52.166 --> 19:55.083
- Yeah, maybe...what?
- 'I don't know.'

19:55.166 --> 19:59.750
Maybe I'd see you
over there or something?

19:59.834 --> 20:00.917
Hey!

20:01.000 --> 20:02.250
What the hell
did I tell you?

20:02.333 --> 20:03.750
I told you not
to
touch it,
didn't I?

20:03.834 --> 20:05.750
- Just checking the flex--
- Didn't I?

20:05.834 --> 20:07.208
Now you're out here
driving
slap shots with it?

20:07.291 --> 20:09.041
Sean, I'm not..

20:09.125 --> 20:11.125
Oh, you think I'm washed up,
is that it? You think I'm
done?

20:11.208 --> 20:14.500
- No, Sean, I don't--
- The stick's mine!

20:14.583 --> 20:17.041
I catch you with it
again,
I'll take it upside your
head.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.500
You could smell the whiskey

20:25.583 --> 20:27.667
coming off the guy
ten feet away.

20:27.750 --> 20:30.834
So Sean was still
playing hockey back
then?

20:30.917 --> 20:33.667
- You get a look at the
stick?
- Not really.

20:33.750 --> 20:37.792
But he definitely had that
washed-up jock thing going
on.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.166
I've seen my share.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.917
- You Valens?
- Yeah.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.542
Pierson, Central.

20:47.625 --> 20:50.709
Got six messages asking
about a robbery pattern.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.625
Uh, yeah, yeah.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.959
Listen, uh..

20:56.625 --> 20:58.834
Dayley's market,
what do you got?

20:58.917 --> 21:02.000
Couple of similars around
the neighborhood, same MO.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.875
Knockdown purse snatchings,
older female victims.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.542
- Any injuries?
- Bumps and bruises.

21:07.625 --> 21:09.500
Well, what about leads?

21:09.583 --> 21:11.500
'Uh, description,
eyeballs, anything?'

21:11.583 --> 21:13.333
Usual mess,
he's black, he's white

21:13.417 --> 21:16.458
he's tall,
he's a half-pint.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.333
'What's with you on this thing?'

21:18.417 --> 21:20.500
Nothing.
A case we got.

21:20.583 --> 21:21.917
Just keep me posted,
will you?

21:28.750 --> 21:30.333
Still gives you
goose bumps, huh?

21:30.417 --> 21:32.917
Even my Russian grand-pop
went bonkers.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.375
People forget.

21:34.458 --> 21:36.917
We still had to beat
the Finns just to get a medal.

21:38.333 --> 21:41.041
What's this I hear about you
going back out on the ice
again?

21:41.125 --> 21:42.542
Uh..

21:42.625 --> 21:44.083
...little pickup league.

21:44.166 --> 21:46.083
Me and some guys
reliving our glory days.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.458
You want to come?

21:47.542 --> 21:49.417
You ain't seen hockey
till you seen it live.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.375
I'll have the EMT's waiting.

21:51.458 --> 21:53.041
So Sean wasn't just good

21:53.125 --> 21:55.166
he was Sean
"The Shamrock" Flanagan.

21:55.250 --> 21:57.500
Real stud on
ice in
Canada.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.291
Champion center
in the AAA leagues.

21:59.375 --> 22:01.208
Shot at the Miracle
team
in '80.

22:01.291 --> 22:03.291
"Stick and Blade
magazine,
March '79."

22:04.917 --> 22:06.291
Take a look at the stick.

22:08.792 --> 22:10.125
You see that?

22:21.500 --> 22:22.583
There it is.

22:22.667 --> 22:24.083
Shamrock.

22:24.166 --> 22:25.834
Luck of the
Irish
just ran out.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.250
Impressive stuff, Shamrock.

22:31.333 --> 22:33.709
Most athletes, can't shut
'em up about their glory days.

22:33.792 --> 22:38.250
But you, a champion,
not so much as a peep.

22:38.333 --> 22:41.375
Why so bashful, Sean?

22:41.458 --> 22:43.125
Ancient history.

22:43.208 --> 22:44.959
Everything I had
got taken away.

22:45.041 --> 22:46.417
Accident on your
bike in Calgary.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.667
Blindsided, right?

22:47.750 --> 22:48.959
Shattered my femur.

22:49.041 --> 22:50.083
Same night you found out
you were invited

22:50.166 --> 22:51.375
to the Olympic tryouts.

22:51.458 --> 22:54.166
Could've been the only
Philly kid on the squad.

22:54.250 --> 22:55.875
So close I could taste it.

22:55.959 --> 22:57.458
Night of the accident

22:57.542 --> 23:00.959
your blood alcohol
level was 0.16.

23:01.041 --> 23:03.458
Witnesses say you were playing
chicken with a logging truck.

23:03.542 --> 23:05.125
(Miller)
'Wasn't an accident
benched you.'

23:05.208 --> 23:06.959
Just pure stupidity.

23:07.041 --> 23:08.709
Is that you..

23:08.792 --> 23:11.500
...with the stick
that killed your brother?

23:11.583 --> 23:13.542
Same stick you said
wasn't yours?

23:15.208 --> 23:16.250
Aw, man.

23:19.875 --> 23:22.583
I never wanted to see
this damn thing again.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.583
The night I crashed
this stick survived

23:24.667 --> 23:26.667
the impact
that ended my career.

23:26.750 --> 23:29.166
Not even a scratch on it.

23:31.959 --> 23:35.834
Killed my
brother.
Thing is cursed.

23:35.917 --> 23:39.083
Stick didn't ice your
brother on its own, Sean.

23:39.166 --> 23:40.625
Somebody swung it.

23:40.709 --> 23:42.542
Not me.

23:42.625 --> 23:46.250
Didn't want to admit it
then,
but...it was Tommy's time.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.792
Idiot Dwight
called
for you again.

23:56.375 --> 23:58.458
I'll catch up with
him after the game.

23:59.709 --> 24:03.583
- Are you coming today?
- Ma's not doing good.

24:03.667 --> 24:05.250
Needs me here.

24:07.375 --> 24:09.125
Hey, Tommy.

24:10.250 --> 24:11.709
Alberta.

24:11.792 --> 24:15.333
Final 20 seconds of the
game,
I get a clean breakaway.

24:15.417 --> 24:17.917
Mancuso's in the goal and..

24:18.000 --> 24:20.583
Man, I don't even know
how
it happened, I just..

24:20.667 --> 24:22.792
I moved my hands,
you know, and this
stick

24:22.875 --> 24:24.000
put it in the twine.

24:29.458 --> 24:30.583
Won the championship.

24:34.750 --> 24:36.000
It's yours now.

24:37.875 --> 24:39.125
Sean, you're gonna
need that, you know

24:39.208 --> 24:40.667
when you get back up
to Calgary--

24:40.750 --> 24:42.667
It ain't gonna happen.

24:42.750 --> 24:43.959
It's over, Tommy.

24:45.041 --> 24:48.166
Look, it's your
time now, bro, okay?

24:48.250 --> 24:50.166
Take it.

24:58.125 --> 25:00.000
Stick didn't win
that game, Sean.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.625
It was all you.

25:03.792 --> 25:06.250
I'll tell you what

25:06.333 --> 25:08.000
you girls win today

25:08.083 --> 25:10.583
I'll catch your
next home game.

25:10.667 --> 25:12.083
Maybe even bring ma.

25:14.583 --> 25:17.250
Now go on,
get out of here.

25:24.667 --> 25:28.208
I wanted to watch the Olympics
with him that night.

25:28.291 --> 25:29.500
But he said he had plans.

25:29.583 --> 25:31.500
You never mentioned these
plans to the police?

25:31.583 --> 25:34.417
Just figured he'd
blown
me off for the team.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.083
Like maybe they accepted him.

25:40.500 --> 25:43.250
I used to love
that game, you know?

25:43.333 --> 25:46.709
Give anything to get back
on the ice with my brother

25:46.792 --> 25:48.625
just one time.

25:58.417 --> 25:59.625
Thanks, Michelle.

25:59.709 --> 26:01.375
Scotty, you
should
eat something.

26:01.458 --> 26:02.959
You look thin.

26:03.041 --> 26:06.792
Listen, I've been looking into
things up at Dayley's market.

26:06.875 --> 26:08.041
Scotty, I told you already--

26:08.125 --> 26:10.000
Ma, I know what
happened to you.

26:11.959 --> 26:15.208
The guy knocked you down,
took your purse.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.542
Did you get a look at him?

26:21.083 --> 26:23.792
It was my fault.

26:23.875 --> 26:27.166
Walking out, I knew
something was off.

26:29.291 --> 26:31.333
I feel like a fool.

26:31.417 --> 26:33.750
- Had to cancel all my cards.
- It's not your fault.

26:33.834 --> 26:36.959
It just happens.
You don't got time to react.

26:37.041 --> 26:39.667
No. Your father..

26:39.750 --> 26:41.291
...he'd have
gone
crazy if I told
him.

26:41.375 --> 26:42.834
Never let me
out of his
sight.

26:42.917 --> 26:46.500
No, pops
don't need to know.

26:46.583 --> 26:49.208
But, ma, look, I need you
to help me stop this guy

26:49.291 --> 26:51.333
from hitting anybody else.

26:51.417 --> 26:53.500
I have some mug shots
I need you to look at.

26:53.583 --> 26:55.667
Oh, it all happened too fast.

26:55.750 --> 26:58.041
I didn't see him.

26:58.125 --> 27:00.208
I want to help you..

27:01.959 --> 27:03.375
...but I can't.

27:10.125 --> 27:12.417
Your boys are roughing
up
Trenton tonight, huh?

27:12.500 --> 27:14.750
Fourteen and six,
hungry season.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.542
This kind of distraction's
hard on them.

27:16.625 --> 27:19.041
Since when do you care
about your players?

27:19.125 --> 27:21.458
Drive them hard, burn
them out, move on.

27:21.542 --> 27:22.792
(Rush)
'Yeah, made a career of it'

27:22.875 --> 27:25.250
starting with
the Dock Rats in
'80.

27:25.333 --> 27:26.834
Don't run games
that way anymore.

27:26.917 --> 27:29.750
A different time,
a different game.

27:29.834 --> 27:32.417
So the night of
the Miracle on
Ice

27:32.500 --> 27:33.500
remember where you were?

27:33.583 --> 27:36.041
Meeting with the owner,
ran long.

27:36.125 --> 27:37.709
Future of the team
was at stake.

27:37.792 --> 27:40.667
See, that's strange because
we checked with his
secretary.

27:40.750 --> 27:42.834
Said the team owner
was on a plane

27:42.917 --> 27:44.667
back to Boston
early that night.

27:44.750 --> 27:47.667
A snowstorm was blowing in,
flew out to beat it.

27:47.750 --> 27:48.709
Missed the Miracle.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.583
Must have mixed up my times.

27:50.667 --> 27:52.917
That's not the only thing about
that meeting you got mixed up.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.041
Like trying to get Tommy
kicked off the team.

27:55.125 --> 27:56.375
Now hold on.

27:56.458 --> 27:59.000
No, owner said no way.
That Tommy had spunk.

27:59.083 --> 28:02.250
The kid was a draw.
You were pissed.

28:02.333 --> 28:03.917
The next day,
Tommy's on ice

28:04.000 --> 28:05.542
and you're lying about
what you were doing.

28:05.625 --> 28:06.750
I don't have
to listen to
this.

28:06.834 --> 28:07.750
How come you don't talk

28:07.834 --> 28:10.083
to your daughter anymore, coach?

28:10.166 --> 28:12.250
Molly.

28:12.333 --> 28:14.750
Hard as I was on my players,
I was tougher on her.

28:14.834 --> 28:16.500
Or after you iced
her boyfriend

28:16.583 --> 28:18.166
the two of youse
had a falling out.

28:18.250 --> 28:20.000
(Rush)
'Rules on Molly were clear'

28:20.083 --> 28:22.583
but Tommy was
violating the
policy.

28:22.667 --> 28:24.583
You couldn't get
rid of him one way

28:24.667 --> 28:26.125
time to run
a different play.

28:26.208 --> 28:27.250
One that ends
with him dead.

28:27.333 --> 28:28.959
You got it wrong.

28:29.041 --> 28:32.083
Any player I wouldn't
have
minded seeing Molly with

28:32.166 --> 28:33.875
it was Tommy.

28:33.959 --> 28:36.583
Kid had more guts than
any guy I ever coached.

28:40.291 --> 28:42.417
(male announcer)
'We are scoreless
and down to the last'

28:42.500 --> 28:44.417
'two minutes of
the third period.'

28:44.500 --> 28:46.667
'Both teams fighting it
out back and forth.'

28:46.750 --> 28:48.458
Nothing in the twine.

28:50.583 --> 28:55.250
'Oh, and yet another illegal
hit from Cullen Masters.'

28:55.333 --> 28:58.083
'I'll tell you, that's
going to draw a penalty.'

28:58.166 --> 29:01.041
You're throwing me out
'cause this little freak?

29:01.125 --> 29:02.542
Get up, punk!

29:02.625 --> 29:05.875
Catch you alone,
I'm gonna kick your
candy-ass!

29:05.959 --> 29:08.500
(male announcer)
'Cullen Masters ejected
from the game.'

29:08.583 --> 29:09.834
And none too soon.

29:09.917 --> 29:14.208
Tommy Flanagan will
get the penalty
shot.

29:14.291 --> 29:18.000
One chance, Tommy.
Can you do this?

29:18.083 --> 29:19.542
Yeah, coach.

29:21.875 --> 29:22.834
I got it.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.041
(male announcer)
'Flanagan shoots left
into the crease.'

29:38.125 --> 29:39.083
'He's got it!'

29:39.166 --> 29:41.834
He got it and he scores!

29:41.917 --> 29:44.250
'Little Tommy Flanagan scores!'

29:44.333 --> 29:48.125
'One nothing at home,
Dock Rats take it!'

29:49.792 --> 29:51.625
'Little Tommy Flanagan.'

29:51.709 --> 29:55.375
'Unbelievable!'

29:55.458 --> 29:57.083
'He is truly..'

29:57.166 --> 29:59.000
'...a hometown hero!'

30:03.792 --> 30:07.166
I put him on the spot,
he delivered.

30:07.250 --> 30:09.041
Tried to get him released
from the Dock Rats

30:09.125 --> 30:10.375
to offer him a better shot.

30:10.458 --> 30:12.000
Better shot how?

30:12.083 --> 30:16.750
Coach at Powell University
lost
his first line to injuries.

30:16.834 --> 30:18.500
Tommy could have subbed.

30:18.583 --> 30:21.083
Division II hockey.
A shot at college.

30:21.166 --> 30:23.083
Well, what about
Tommy and Molly?

30:23.166 --> 30:26.542
Anything going on with them,
I didn't know about.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.083
But-but I wouldn't have
stood in the way.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.625
A little gap in
Molly's school records.

30:37.917 --> 30:40.250
What's wrong with this picture?

30:40.333 --> 30:43.041
Her graduating class, 1980.

30:43.125 --> 30:44.500
December, 1980.

30:44.583 --> 30:46.417
Seven months later
than everybody else.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.542
Straight "A" student.
How does that happen?

30:48.625 --> 30:50.083
Three days after
Tommy was killed

30:50.166 --> 30:54.417
Coach shipped her off to
St. Emily's in Lancaster.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.667
That's where good unwed
Catholic girls go to have
babies

30:56.750 --> 30:58.125
no one's supposed
to know about.

30:58.208 --> 31:01.166
So Tommy and Molly
weren't just close.

31:01.250 --> 31:02.500
She was pregnant.

31:02.583 --> 31:04.583
And coach covered it up.

31:04.667 --> 31:06.250
No wonder they
don't talk anymore.

31:06.333 --> 31:08.041
Let's bring Molly
back in.

31:08.125 --> 31:10.166
Work both of them
till one of them cracks.

31:15.959 --> 31:18.667
I gotta say, I kinda get
what you saw in Tommy.

31:20.750 --> 31:23.125
Not a bad looking kid.

31:23.208 --> 31:26.458
I told you we
weren't
involved that way.

31:26.542 --> 31:29.125
The Dock Rats said you two
were getting pretty close.

31:29.208 --> 31:31.458
That is up until
Tommy got killed.

31:31.542 --> 31:33.792
And you got carted off
the Lancaster

31:33.875 --> 31:35.625
in the middle
of your senior year.

31:35.709 --> 31:37.875
St. Emily's.

31:37.959 --> 31:39.458
Why there, Molly?

31:39.542 --> 31:42.500
Your daughter was pregnant.

31:42.583 --> 31:44.625
You went out on a
limb
for Tommy Flanagan.

31:44.709 --> 31:46.000
And this is how
he pays you back?

31:46.083 --> 31:47.291
The kid was a sniper.

31:47.375 --> 31:50.083
He finds an opportunity,
he puts it in the net.

31:50.166 --> 31:52.625
Molly never told me
who the father was.

31:52.709 --> 31:54.750
But you knew,
didn't you,
coach?

31:56.542 --> 31:57.959
He was ashamed of you.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.667
He sent you away,
forced you to give up the
baby.

32:00.750 --> 32:04.166
He was my father.
He was protecting
me.

32:04.250 --> 32:06.166
No, he was trying to
sweep it under the rug.

32:06.250 --> 32:07.583
Erase it from history
by killing Tommy--

32:07.667 --> 32:10.792
You don't understand!

32:10.875 --> 32:14.000
She wanted to give the baby up.
It was her choice.

32:14.083 --> 32:16.542
You're saying you were
fine with her keeping it?

32:16.625 --> 32:19.792
Then? No.

32:19.875 --> 32:24.834
If I could take it all
back,
handle things differently

32:24.917 --> 32:26.542
I'd do it in a second.

32:26.625 --> 32:28.000
(Stillman)
'But that night,
when Molly told you'

32:28.083 --> 32:30.208
she was pregnant
you went to the rink.

32:30.291 --> 32:33.041
No! I swear to you

32:33.125 --> 32:35.375
I did not kill that boy.

32:37.417 --> 32:41.875
If I just told
him the truth..

32:41.959 --> 32:43.917
...maybe Tommy
would still be
alive.

32:45.834 --> 32:47.291
Told him what, Molly?

32:47.375 --> 32:49.041
About the baby.

32:50.458 --> 32:52.792
What about the baby?

32:52.875 --> 32:54.542
[crying]
It wasn't
Tommy's.

32:58.709 --> 33:00.041
Whose was it?

33:00.125 --> 33:02.834
[sobbing]
Oh, God.

33:05.667 --> 33:07.792
I'm so ashamed.

33:07.875 --> 33:08.875
Yes! Yes!

33:08.959 --> 33:10.834
'Yes! Did you see that!'

33:10.917 --> 33:13.000
(male announcer on TV)
'It's a miracle!'

33:13.083 --> 33:14.000
We won!

33:14.083 --> 33:15.375
'We just won!'

33:19.125 --> 33:21.625
Hey. Hey, come on.
We won.

33:21.709 --> 33:22.917
What's wrong?

33:24.625 --> 33:26.750
Tommy, that party

33:26.834 --> 33:28.375
New Year's Eve..

33:28.458 --> 33:30.417
I thought you
were
gonna be there.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.208
I waited.

33:32.291 --> 33:34.500
He kept saying
you were coming

33:34.583 --> 33:36.125
that you were his boy.

33:36.208 --> 33:37.333
Wait.
Who said that?

33:37.417 --> 33:39.750
I couldn't even
taste the
alcohol.

33:39.834 --> 33:43.917
Didn't realize
I was getting
so...drunk.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.250
He started kissing me.

33:46.333 --> 33:50.041
Oh, God, I let him!

33:50.125 --> 33:51.709
Molly, who?

33:53.375 --> 33:56.458
Dwight.
It was
Dwight.

33:57.667 --> 33:59.834
Tommy..

33:59.917 --> 34:01.583
...I'm pregnant.

34:04.375 --> 34:07.375
I tried to tell him about it
but he won't even look at me.

34:12.291 --> 34:15.083
Tommy, please,
I'm so sorry.

34:17.834 --> 34:19.875
I don't know
what I'm gonna
do.

34:25.542 --> 34:27.333
I broke his heart.

34:29.375 --> 34:31.417
Mine, too.

34:31.500 --> 34:34.792
After you told him,
he left

34:34.875 --> 34:36.291
...and headed back
to the rink?

34:37.709 --> 34:42.291
Yeah. Said he-he needed
a place to think.

34:45.750 --> 34:49.041
My dad came home,
he'd seen I was
crying.

34:49.125 --> 34:51.959
I told him I
was pregnant.

34:52.041 --> 34:54.125
And let him
believe
it was Tommy's.

34:58.083 --> 35:00.041
Had the baby that fall..

35:01.417 --> 35:02.917
...little girl.

35:04.917 --> 35:07.458
Never found out
what happened to
her.

35:09.750 --> 35:12.834
But not a day goes by
I don't think of them
both.

35:17.667 --> 35:22.333
Molly, what name did you put
on the birth certificate

35:22.417 --> 35:24.083
as the father?

35:24.166 --> 35:25.750
None.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.875
I left it blank.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.834
How's that look?

35:37.917 --> 35:40.041
Gotta fade the
type
a little more.

35:40.125 --> 35:42.417
Spill some coffee on
it.
Try this one.

35:42.500 --> 35:43.542
Hmm.

35:43.625 --> 35:45.417
I'll run it through
the copier again.

35:45.500 --> 35:46.917
Snowplow owner confirmed

35:47.000 --> 35:49.917
Dwight Barnes worked for
him until March of 1980.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.291
"Fired for cause.

35:51.375 --> 35:53.875
Subcontracting plow jobs
to his 14-year-old
brother?"

35:53.959 --> 35:54.917
For months.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.625
Boss got wind when
the kid fell asleep

35:56.709 --> 35:59.291
at the wheel and
plowed into a Dunkin' Donuts.

35:59.375 --> 36:02.667
So Dwight wasn't working
the night Tommy was
killed.

36:04.625 --> 36:07.375
Remember a girl
named Molly Heaton?

36:07.458 --> 36:09.417
- Coach's daughter, right?
- Mm-hmm.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.917
Major babe.
You ever hook up with
that?

36:13.000 --> 36:14.709
I could've.
It's hard to say.

36:14.792 --> 36:16.417
'How's that work?'

36:16.500 --> 36:18.542
You ply her with the
Schuylkill Swill and Quaaludes

36:18.625 --> 36:19.834
till she don't know
what hit her?

36:19.917 --> 36:22.917
Please, I had it going on
<i>au naturel.</i>

36:23.000 --> 36:25.458
I didn't need
no chemical help.

36:25.542 --> 36:27.125
Well, you must've peaked
in the '80s, Dwight

36:27.208 --> 36:28.959
'cause I just don't see it.

36:29.041 --> 36:33.083
Now, Tommy, that's
different
athlete, star on the ice.

36:33.166 --> 36:34.750
Little Tommy? Come on.

36:34.834 --> 36:37.083
Snakin' your best
friend's
girl while he's not
looking?

36:37.166 --> 36:38.208
What kind of
loser
move is that?

36:38.291 --> 36:40.792
I never tapped
that girl, alright?

36:40.875 --> 36:42.917
She shouldn't
flatter herself.

36:45.542 --> 36:46.709
Hmm.

36:47.917 --> 36:51.166
Well, congratulations, Dwight,
you're a father.

36:54.041 --> 36:56.875
Whoa.
Whoa, wait a minute.

36:56.959 --> 36:58.291
You never hooked up
with Molly?

36:58.375 --> 37:00.000
How's your name
on the birth
certificate?

37:00.083 --> 37:01.625
What is it,
immaculate conception?

37:01.709 --> 37:03.959
The bitch is lying!

37:04.041 --> 37:04.959
That's not my kid.

37:05.041 --> 37:06.959
Not my kid,
not my problem.

37:07.041 --> 37:10.041
You banged Tommy's girl
to bring him down a peg.

37:10.125 --> 37:11.291
Tommy was ducking
your phone calls.

37:11.375 --> 37:12.875
Getting respect on the ice.

37:12.959 --> 37:15.667
He had a shot to go
to college, a better life.

37:15.750 --> 37:17.000
He was leavin'
you in the
dust.

37:17.083 --> 37:18.125
You had to put
him in his
place.

37:18.208 --> 37:20.333
That's crap!
You don't know jack.

37:20.417 --> 37:23.375
We know it was your brother
driving the snowplow that
night.

37:23.458 --> 37:25.291
Your alibi just bit the dust.

37:25.375 --> 37:27.834
And we know Tommy was pissed
at you for jumping on Molly.

37:27.917 --> 37:30.458
And we got the DNA off
the stick that killed Tommy.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.709
Gonna match yours?

37:36.291 --> 37:38.500
Well, you're gonna need
a sample from me, aren't
you?

37:40.917 --> 37:42.834
No way.
It ain't gonna happen.

37:43.959 --> 37:45.125
You sure about that, Dwight?

37:45.208 --> 37:48.250
Oh, yeah, I'm sure,
because I know my rights

37:48.333 --> 37:51.000
and you've gotta
have my consent.

37:53.834 --> 37:54.959
Come here!

37:57.917 --> 37:59.083
You just gave it.

38:03.458 --> 38:05.333
Hey, you get out
in front of this

38:05.417 --> 38:08.125
we'll talk to the DA,
tell him you cooperated..

38:08.208 --> 38:10.000
...and see
what we can do.

38:11.834 --> 38:13.333
Damn.

38:13.417 --> 38:17.291
This whole Molly thing,
he couldn't let it go.

38:17.375 --> 38:18.709
'He hardly even
knew the girl.'

38:18.792 --> 38:21.333
You and Tommy were pals
long before that, right?

38:21.417 --> 38:23.917
That's what I'm saying.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.834
I just went
there to
talk.

38:27.250 --> 38:29.250
He acted like
he was better than
me.

38:50.125 --> 38:52.667
Figured I'd find you here.

38:52.750 --> 38:55.125
Some win, huh?

38:55.208 --> 38:57.125
Chicks are going ape
out there.

38:57.208 --> 38:59.291
Maybe even get you laid.

39:00.375 --> 39:03.083
Miracles happen, right?

39:03.166 --> 39:05.834
What the hell is
wrong with you?

39:05.917 --> 39:07.291
'Molly..'

39:07.375 --> 39:08.667
And I know
what you did, Dwight.

39:08.750 --> 39:10.166
Tommy, listen..

39:10.250 --> 39:11.583
You knew I liked her, man.

39:11.667 --> 39:13.625
Come on, LT!

39:13.709 --> 39:16.250
I told you chicks respect guys

39:16.333 --> 39:19.125
who step up,
pull the trigger.

39:19.208 --> 39:20.709
She's pregnant, Dwight.

39:23.166 --> 39:24.959
Come on.

39:25.041 --> 39:26.917
That kid could be anybody's.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.083
Sporty little slut like that.

39:32.458 --> 39:34.166
What the hell, Tommy!

39:35.458 --> 39:38.291
What are you,
like some big shot now?

39:38.375 --> 39:41.125
Wouldn't be out here
if it wasn't for me.

39:41.208 --> 39:43.250
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:45.041 --> 39:47.125
- Man, just get out of here.
- Oh..

39:47.208 --> 39:48.125
'Get out of here.'

39:48.208 --> 39:49.625
Oh, play a few hockey games

39:49.709 --> 39:52.500
now all of a sudden you're
too good to call me back?

39:52.583 --> 39:54.333
me

39:54.417 --> 39:57.250
Loses the girl.
Well, boo-hoo!

39:57.333 --> 39:59.583
Now Little Tommy's
gonna judge me?

39:59.667 --> 40:01.875
- Little Tommy?
- Tell me how to live my
life?

40:01.959 --> 40:04.125
Little Tommy?
I ain't Little Tommy no more!

40:04.208 --> 40:06.458
You don't get
to call me that!

40:06.542 --> 40:08.834
Everybody always
calls you a tool

40:08.917 --> 40:10.583
and I'm the only one
that sticks by you!

40:10.667 --> 40:12.125
The only one!

40:12.208 --> 40:16.667
Let you push me around,
I play your wingman, for
this!

40:18.542 --> 40:21.041
They're right about you.

40:21.125 --> 40:22.625
You're nothing but a loser.

40:27.709 --> 40:29.000
Take it back, LT.

40:29.083 --> 40:31.333
That kid is better off

40:31.417 --> 40:33.375
not knowing the truth
about you, anyway.

40:46.917 --> 40:49.250
Take it back, Tommy!

40:50.166 --> 40:52.417
Take it back!

40:55.083 --> 40:56.458
You're a loser, Dwight.

40:58.250 --> 40:59.583
You always will be.

41:01.625 --> 41:02.834
Huh!

43:41.417 --> 43:42.709
