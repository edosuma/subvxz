OF COURSE,
IF ANYONE WANTS
TO PRESS CHARGES,

36:26.655 --> 36:27.386
JUST CONTACT ME.

36:27.386 --> 36:30.489
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT IS TOTALLY
UNNECESSARY.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.621
OK.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.628

36:43.472 --> 36:44.703
HUH?

36:44.703 --> 36:46.335
WOW, BEN.

36:46.335 --> 36:49.207
JUST--WOW.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.739
IT'S A LITTLE TIGHT
IN THE CROTCH AREA.

36:50.739 --> 36:54.643
BUT I LIVE WITH THE PAIN
BECAUSE I CARE.

36:54.643 --> 36:57.246
YOU'RE OK WITH ME
DOING THIS, RIGHT?

36:57.246 --> 36:58.987
I'M STILL AFRAID.

36:58.987 --> 37:02.491
BUT I CAN SEE NOW
HOW IMPORTANT
THIS IS TO YOU,

37:02.491 --> 37:06.224
AND I'M GOING
TO SUPPORT YOU BECAUSE
I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.996
YOU KNOW,
I'VE NEVER DATED
A GUY BEFORE

37:07.996 --> 37:11.930
WHO DRESSED UP LIKE
A WEIRD, SEMI-ROBOT
TO PROTECT ME.

37:11.930 --> 37:14.563
I'D DO ANYTHING
FOR YOU, BABY.

37:14.563 --> 37:15.704
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE GOLD COLOR?

37:15.704 --> 37:17.766
IT'S MY IDEA--
FIGURED SILVER WAS

37:17.766 --> 37:19.608
A LITTLE TOO
ON THE NOSE.

37:19.608 --> 37:21.640
OH, I LIKE THE GOLD.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.443
YEAH?
IT'S VERY MANLY.

37:24.443 --> 37:25.574

37:25.574 --> 37:28.417
NO STUPID,
MUSCULAR DEMON

37:28.417 --> 37:30.018
COULD EVER COMPARE
TO YOU.

37:30.018 --> 37:31.249
MMM.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.281
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.

37:32.281 --> 37:34.683
COME ON,
LET'S GO PUT THIS JERK
BACK IN HIS PLACE.

37:34.683 --> 37:35.584
YOU'RE SURE
YOU CAN LURE HIM HERE?

37:35.584 --> 37:37.886
OH, BABY,
OF COURSE I CAN LURE
A MALE DEMON HERE.

37:37.886 --> 37:39.858
I'VE BEEN GOING
THROUGH HEAT FOR EONS--

37:39.858 --> 37:41.590
MATING WITH HUNDREDS--

37:41.590 --> 37:45.334
NO, GOD.
THOUSANDS OF GUYS
ALONG THE WAY.

37:45.334 --> 37:48.997
YEAH, YEAH. PRETTY SURE
I CAN LURE HIM HERE.

37:49.668 --> 37:52.741

38:14.563 --> 38:15.724
GET INSIDE,
LOCK THE DOORS.

38:15.724 --> 38:18.066

LET'S DANCE.

38:36.415 --> 38:37.346
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

38:37.346 --> 38:38.687
BEN'S DEFENDING
MY HONOR.

38:38.687 --> 38:39.888
WHAT, ALREADY?
YEAH.

38:39.888 --> 38:41.920
OH, HOT DIGGITY DOG.

38:44.493 --> 38:46.495
THAT'S A GOOD-LOOKING
ROBOT SUIT, ISN'T IT?

38:46.495 --> 38:46.955
YEAH.
LOOK AT THAT.

38:46.955 --> 38:48.897
YEAH, I STILL THINK
HE SHOULD HAVE GONE
WITH THE SILVER GLOVES.

38:48.897 --> 38:51.430
THE GOLD'S
A LITTLE TACKY.

38:51.430 --> 38:52.431
[GRUNTING]

38:52.431 --> 38:53.762
[INDISTINCT]
LOOK AT THIS.

38:53.762 --> 38:56.104
OH, THE ROBOT SUIT'S
GOING GANGBUSTERS.

38:56.104 --> 38:58.737

39:02.841 --> 39:04.913
THAT--THAT--
[METAL CLANKS]

39:04.913 --> 39:07.746
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
ANY FIGHT I'VE EVER SEEN.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.948
THIS IS--

39:09.948 --> 39:11.480
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

39:11.480 --> 39:12.651
OH, NO.
WHEN I HUGGED BEN,

39:12.651 --> 39:14.983
I THINK
I MIGHT HAVE RUBBED
PHEROMONES OFF ON HIM.

39:14.983 --> 39:16.585
THAT DEMON IS NOT TRYING
TO FIGHT BEN.

39:16.585 --> 39:18.056
HE'S TRYING
TO MATE WITH HIM.

39:18.056 --> 39:19.728
OH, GOD.

39:21.990 --> 39:23.732
OH, MY GOD.

39:23.732 --> 39:24.733
WE HAVE TO STOP HIM.

39:24.733 --> 39:25.734
OK.
WE MAKE IT OUT THERE,

39:25.734 --> 39:27.596
YOU TURN ON THE HOSE,
AND I'LL BLAST HIM.

39:27.596 --> 39:29.668
ONE...2...OH!

39:29.668 --> 39:32.771
OH, THAT WAS
A TERRIBLE PLACE FOR
A VENTILATION HOLE.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.443
3! GO!

39:35.704 --> 39:37.005
ALL RIGHT, BENJI.
HERE YOU GO.

39:37.005 --> 39:37.746
YOU JUST NEED
TO RELAX.

39:37.746 --> 39:39.748
YEAH. I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE SO UPSET, MAN.

39:39.748 --> 39:41.009
"I GOT
ANOTHER DEMON AFTER ME

39:41.009 --> 39:42.581
"THAT WANTS
TO MAKE LOVE TO ME.

39:42.581 --> 39:43.552
WHY AM I SO ATTRACTIVE?"

39:43.552 --> 39:45.153
SOCK, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT WAS LIKE, OK?

39:45.153 --> 39:46.084
IT WAS TERRIBLE.

39:46.084 --> 39:46.915
THE ROBOT SUIT
PROTECTED YOU!

39:46.915 --> 39:50.018
YOU KNOW, THAT DEMON DOUCHE
NEVER EVEN TOUCHED
YOUR ACTUAL BODY.

39:50.018 --> 39:52.160
BUT IT WAS
THE GRINDING...

39:52.160 --> 39:53.622
THE HUMPING...
OHH.

39:53.622 --> 39:56.725
AND THE ROMANTIC WORDS
HE WAS WHISPERING
IN MY EAR HOLE.

39:56.725 --> 39:58.527
I CAN'T GET IT
OUT OF MY HEAD.

39:58.527 --> 40:02.701
MMM. YOUR EMOTIONAL TRAUMA
MAKES YOU SO MUCH MORE
ATTRACTIVE TO ME.

40:02.701 --> 40:06.775
OHH. CHEERS.
CHEERS TO THAT.
THERE WE GO.

40:08.076 --> 40:10.479

THAT SPRONG WASN'T RIGHT
ABOUT US.

40:14.082 --> 40:15.013
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

40:15.013 --> 40:17.716
WELL,
THAT WE'RE LOSERS.

40:17.716 --> 40:18.647
THINK ABOUT IT.
I MEAN,

40:18.647 --> 40:20.789
WE'RE STILL DOING
THE SAME THING WE DID
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

40:20.789 --> 40:22.821
NOBODY'S DONE ANYTHING
WITH THEIR LIVES.

40:22.821 --> 40:25.754
THAT'S
A LITTLE MESSED UP.

40:27.796 --> 40:30.459
UH-UH. NO. ANDI,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:30.459 --> 40:32.160
I REJECT THAT,
AND I REJECT YOU.

40:32.160 --> 40:33.662
OK? YEAH!
DON'T YOU LAUGH.

40:33.662 --> 40:35.634
NONE OF US
HAVE DONE ANYTHING
WITH OUR LIVES?

WHO YOU'RE LOOKING AT?

40:42.110 --> 40:43.672
I WAS A LOVEABLE
FOAM WRENCH CHARACTER

40:43.672 --> 40:46.915
THAT WAS ADORED BY CHILDREN
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, OK?

40:46.915 --> 40:48.617
I TOOK A STAND
AGAINST TYRANNY

40:48.617 --> 40:50.649
AND ALLEGED
COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.

40:50.649 --> 40:51.449

40:51.449 --> 40:53.682
I KICKED
AN OLD LADY'S ASS
ALL OVER TOWN.

40:53.682 --> 40:55.554
I DON'T THINK I COULD FIT
ANY MORE LIFE INTO MYSELF

40:55.554 --> 40:57.686

HE DEFENDED HER HONOR,

41:06.665 --> 41:08.737

A KICKASS ROBOT SUIT.
