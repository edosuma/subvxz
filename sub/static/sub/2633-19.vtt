WEBVTT

00:06.214 --> 00:08.799
Well, that thing's clearly in the way.

00:10.427 --> 00:12.094
All right. A-ha. Heh.

00:14.389 --> 00:15.973
Damn fridge!

00:17.475 --> 00:20.227
- Hi, Joey. How you doing?
- Great...

00:20.895 --> 00:22.813
...roomie.
- Ah!

00:22.981 --> 00:26.442
- Yeah, I guess we are roommates now.
- I know. Now that you bring it up...

00:26.609 --> 00:30.320
...uh, our fridge is broken.
We have to get a new one.

00:30.488 --> 00:34.199
I checked around and your half is $400.
Thanks a lot.

00:35.493 --> 00:37.494
I'm not paying for half of that.

00:37.662 --> 00:40.247
I'm only staying here
until my apartment gets fixed.

00:40.498 --> 00:45.210
Look, Rach, my parents bought this fridge
just after I was born. Okay?

00:45.462 --> 00:49.757
Now, I have never had a problem with it.
Then you show up and it breaks!

00:51.676 --> 00:52.926
What does that tell you?

00:54.304 --> 00:57.765
That refrigerators don't live
as long as people?

00:59.893 --> 01:03.437
All right, you know that the ATM only
lets you take out 300 at a time...

01:03.605 --> 01:05.564
...so I'll take a check
for the other 100.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.108
Heh. You're joking, right?

01:09.903 --> 01:12.821
Of course I'm joking.
I don't take checks.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.617
Thank God you're pretty.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.286
- Hey!
- Hey.

02:01.454 --> 02:04.289
Hey, do you guys know
any cute guys?

02:04.457 --> 02:07.417
Well, of course, I do.
My good friend, Joey, over here.

02:10.839 --> 02:14.299
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you, Chandler.

02:15.635 --> 02:19.638
Anyway, there's a charity ball this weekend
and Ralph Lauren bought a table...

02:19.806 --> 02:21.056
...so I kind of have to go.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.350
- What's the charity?
- I don't know.

02:23.518 --> 02:27.604
Something, either trees or disease, I...

02:27.772 --> 02:30.899
- Ralph mumbles a lot.
- Does Ralph mumble...

02:31.067 --> 02:34.528
...when you're not paying attention?
- Yeah. It's weird.

02:35.363 --> 02:37.573
But the thing is, I need to find a date.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.408
What kind of guy
are you looking for?

02:39.576 --> 02:43.495
Someone that has his own tux
or the ability to rent a tux.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.373
So he has to be a male
who has at least $50.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.709
Ooh, so close.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.837
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.965
- Uh, this is Elizabeth.
- Hi, Elizabeth.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.342
- I'm the student.
- Ha-ha-ha.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.720
Isn't she cute? Nope.

03:01.639 --> 03:04.725
This is none of my business,
but weren't you guys supposed...

03:04.893 --> 03:08.020
...to not be seen in public together?
- Oh, we're not together.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.273
No. We're just two people
who happen to have run into each other...

03:11.441 --> 03:13.609
...here at the coffee house.
Heh, this is...

03:15.653 --> 03:17.279
Oh, sly.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.366
I really wanted to meet you guys,
but I have to run.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.202
- I'll see you later?
- Okay.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.536
- Bye, Ross.
- Bye. See you.

03:24.704 --> 03:25.746
- Oh...
- Oops.

03:25.914 --> 03:29.541
- Didn't mean to run into you like that, sir.
- That is quite all right, ma'am.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.501
Bye.

03:31.669 --> 03:35.380
So why's she leaving? Is it a school night
and she has a lot of homework to do?

03:35.965 --> 03:39.092
Yes. Her molecular epidemiology paper
is due tomorrow.

03:40.678 --> 03:42.888
Well, tell her "good luck" with that.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.016
Anyone else, huh? Bring them on.

03:46.601 --> 03:49.811
- Oh! When's her birthday?
- I don't know, Rachel. Why?

03:49.979 --> 03:53.565
Well, you know it's just been so long
since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.945
- I like Elizabeth.
- Well, thanks.

03:58.112 --> 04:01.865
In fact, I like her so much that you tell
her I want my cookies early this year.

04:03.701 --> 04:06.245
A box of Thin Mints and some Tagalongs.

04:07.205 --> 04:10.374
Guys, give him a break.
Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?

04:10.541 --> 04:12.000
Well, it's actually been great.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.836
She's 20, so she's not looking
for anything too serious...

04:15.004 --> 04:17.255
...which is perfect for me now.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.425
Well, that is great.
And seriously, she seems very nice.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.803
I know you guys like
to give me a hard time...

04:22.971 --> 04:25.097
...but it means a lot to me
that you like her.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.433
- Just knowing you guys are, like...
- Okay, I got a good one.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.061
Okay, um... Heh.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.522
What is she, like, 12?

04:43.366 --> 04:46.159
Chandler, do you think we talk
about our relationship enough?

04:46.327 --> 04:49.037
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll Ups?

04:50.540 --> 04:51.623
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:51.791 --> 04:55.585
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy
for Rachel to take to her thing.

04:55.753 --> 04:57.713
That's so funny,
we found someone too.

04:57.880 --> 05:02.592
That's good. I guess she'll have a choice
between my guy and your weirdo.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.721
- Why would our guy be a weirdo?
- Because that's just your taste.

05:07.598 --> 05:10.809
See, Rachel's not gonna pick
your stupid guy.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.019
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

05:12.186 --> 05:15.105
My guy is a lawyer
who does volunteer work.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.191
And he has one of these.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.444
A face ass?

05:21.863 --> 05:25.449
- A chin dimple.
- Well, uh, our guy works with Chandler.

05:25.616 --> 05:28.660
And he's really nice and smart
and he's a great dresser.

05:29.037 --> 05:33.373
- Have you seen your guy's body?
- No. Our guy's just a floating head.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.961
Well, my guy is spectacular, okay?
He's a massage client.

05:38.129 --> 05:43.467
And one time, um, when he was on the
table, I looked at it. And I mean, all of it.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.512
- You're not supposed to look.
- Yeah, like there are police for that.

05:49.098 --> 05:52.100
- What, you look? You massaged me.
- I know.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.606
All right, your guy may have
a great body, but our guy...

05:57.774 --> 06:00.275
...is really funny.
- Chandler funny?

06:01.903 --> 06:04.321
- Our guy's a great dancer.
- My guy's well-read.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.740
- Our guy has great hair.
- My guy has great teeth.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.910
Our guys smells incredible.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.454
Do you want our guy to be your guy?

06:14.665 --> 06:16.833
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:22.173 --> 06:25.008
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.470
Well, the fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.849
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

06:33.017 --> 06:35.894
Hey, what was in that brown jar?

06:36.062 --> 06:37.979
- That's still in there?
- Not anymore.

06:39.190 --> 06:42.526
Ahem, so, anyway,
how do you want to pay me?

06:44.445 --> 06:46.655
Is this a service you're providing me?

06:48.074 --> 06:52.035
No, for my new fridge.
For our new fridge.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.495
Our new fridge?

06:53.663 --> 06:56.206
- I don't live here anymore.
- So what?

06:56.374 --> 06:59.251
Look, okay, suppose we were
a, uh, divorced couple.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.629
- Uh-huh.
- And I got custody of the kid. Right?

07:02.797 --> 07:07.384
Now, suppose the kid dies
and I gotta buy a new kid.

07:10.221 --> 07:11.763
Okay.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.058
Give me $400!

07:21.315 --> 07:23.233
- Professor Geller?
- Hmm?

07:23.401 --> 07:25.944
Oh, a student I don't know.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.323
I was wondering
if I could talk to you for a moment?

07:30.491 --> 07:33.160
Yes, of course.
What would this be regarding?

07:33.327 --> 07:35.537
- Making out in your office.
- Wh... Shh!

07:37.081 --> 07:39.541
Uh, of course. Why don't we go inside.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.550
Mm... Oh, oh.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.635
- What?
- Doorknob. Doorknob.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.221
Sorry. Ha-ha-ha.

07:53.389 --> 07:56.683
- Um, I actually do need to talk to you.
- Oh. Okay, what about?

07:56.851 --> 07:59.311
- Spring vacation.
- Spring vacation?

07:59.479 --> 08:02.689
Yeah, we have time off,
and a lot of people are going on trips...

08:02.857 --> 08:07.194
- Professor Geller.
- Yes, Professor Fiesenstinlender?

08:08.112 --> 08:09.863
I'll be with you in one moment.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.451
So I will take one box
of the Thin Mints.

08:18.664 --> 08:23.585
You don't understand. Elizabeth was
about to ask me to go on a trip with her.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.588
Is that taking it slow?
I'm not ready for this, okay?

08:26.756 --> 08:30.050
- What do I tell her?
- Tell her the truth. You're not ready.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.803
I could do that.

08:33.971 --> 08:37.515
- Well, what if she gets upset?
- Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.

08:40.477 --> 08:41.645
Or...

08:41.812 --> 08:44.523
...you could just, you know, you...

08:49.111 --> 08:50.779
What the hell are you doing?

08:51.155 --> 08:52.656
Wha...?

08:52.823 --> 08:56.326
What the hell am I doing?
You just broke my fridge!

08:58.287 --> 09:01.790
What? How do you know if...
How do you know it's even broken?

09:01.958 --> 09:04.459
Oh, you think I don't know
what breaks my fridge?

09:06.087 --> 09:07.587
Excuse me.

09:08.548 --> 09:12.133
Well, what do you know? Broken!

09:12.760 --> 09:14.803
That'll be $400.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.931
Joey, I saw you push him.

09:20.309 --> 09:22.310
You pushed him.

09:24.313 --> 09:29.693
Joey, I did not break this. Okay?
That has been broken for a while.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.531
- Remember I told you about our fridge?
- Uh-huh.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.284
I still haven't gotten the check
for your half yet.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.161
Do not give him any money.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.956
I'm not talking to you!
You broke my fridge!

09:51.882 --> 09:56.177
- You wanted to see me, Professor Geller?
- Yes. Yes. Please come in.

09:59.807 --> 10:01.016
Mm, ooh, ooh.

10:01.183 --> 10:04.144
- Doorknob?
- Yeah. It kind of grows on you.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.773
Actually, I wanted to finish
talking to you about spring vacation.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.650
Oh, good.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.404
Look, I...

10:18.326 --> 10:20.952
Look, I've been having
a great time with you.

10:21.120 --> 10:26.916
And I just don't want us to move too fast
or put too much pressure on us.

10:27.084 --> 10:30.128
So I'm sorry, I just don't think
we should go away together yet.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.463
It's too soon.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.717
Uh, Ross, I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

10:35.885 --> 10:40.263
I just wanted to tell you that
I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.

10:44.268 --> 10:45.518
No.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.482
I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.985
- What I meant was...
- You are so adorable.

10:54.153 --> 10:57.697
That. Let's talk about that.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.993
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.204
- How did it go with Elizabeth?
- Huh? Oh, oh.

11:04.372 --> 11:08.166
Fine. It was just a misunderstanding.
She didn't want me to go with her.

11:08.334 --> 11:12.045
She just wanted to let me know that
she's going to Florida for spring vacation.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.215
Wait, is she going for spring vacation
or going for spring break.

11:18.594 --> 11:19.844
What's the difference?

11:20.012 --> 11:23.223
A spring vacation, you're doing nice things
with your grandparents.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.184
Spring break, you're doing frat guys.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.855
Hey, you know what?
Not all spring breaks are like that.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.983
- What did you do on yours?
- I went to Egypt with my dad.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.321
I can see it now.
"Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx."

11:41.200 --> 11:44.160
I think Elizabeth is a little more
serious than, "Spring break!"

11:46.789 --> 11:48.873
All right?
Come on, she's taking my class.

11:49.041 --> 11:52.252
- And slept with the professor.
- I'm gonna call her.

11:54.839 --> 11:58.883
Hey, you guys,
I want you to meet Sebastian.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.301
- Hi.
- We just, uh...

12:00.469 --> 12:05.140
We just met at the newsstand. We both
grabbed for the last Field and Stream. Ha!

12:06.100 --> 12:07.934
What, I read that.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.980
- Can I get you a cup of coffee?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.403
- Rachel, what the hell is this?
- What?

12:18.571 --> 12:22.699
You ask us to find you a guy, and then
you come in here with a guy of your own.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.242
- You found me a guy?
- Yes.

12:24.410 --> 12:27.746
We found you a really cute,
funny guy from Chandler's work.

12:27.913 --> 12:31.207
Yeah, and I found you one, too,
who is not a weirdo.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.503
You know what though, guys,
I really appreciate that...

12:35.671 --> 12:38.256
...but I'm just gonna take Sebastian
to the charity.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.134
Are you sure?
Because our guy smells incredible.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.304
Would you stop it with that already?

12:44.472 --> 12:47.182
- Here you go. Sure.
- Oh, thank you.

12:48.184 --> 12:51.269
So, Sebastian,
do you do any volunteer work?

12:51.437 --> 12:53.646
- Uh, no, not really. Why?
- No reason.

12:53.814 --> 12:57.233
It's just I know a single guy
who does care about other people.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.195
Are you funny?

13:01.322 --> 13:03.948
- Excuse me?
- What are you guys doing?

13:04.116 --> 13:06.367
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!

13:07.870 --> 13:10.121
Look, I just wanted
to have coffee with Rachel.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.873
Well, so do a lot of people.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.586
- Actually, uh, I gotta get going.
- Oh, but you...

13:16.754 --> 13:20.131
- Give me a call sometime.
- But you didn't give me your number.

13:20.299 --> 13:21.966
Okay, see you later.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.136
Turns out he is kind of funny.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.894
I cannot believe you guys!

13:33.062 --> 13:36.022
He was really nice
and he just left because of you!

13:36.232 --> 13:39.192
Yeah, but, "Sebastian"?
What is that, a cat's name?

13:40.694 --> 13:43.696
You know what I noticed, Rachel,
he scares easy.

13:43.864 --> 13:46.574
Now, is that the kind of guy
you want to take to a ball?

13:46.742 --> 13:48.618
"Sebastian, would you like to dance?"

13:48.786 --> 13:51.579
"Uh, okay. I gotta go. Aah!"

13:51.789 --> 13:54.499
All right, guys stop it.
Rachel, we're very sorry.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.418
That is a very insensitive thing
for us to do.

13:57.670 --> 14:01.172
You know what? Let us make it up
to you. We've two great guys for you.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.174
Yeah, what have you got to lose?

14:03.342 --> 14:07.136
You might even end up with someone
really special. If you pick my guy.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.391
- All right.
- Okay. So you will meet our guys?

14:11.559 --> 14:12.976
Yes, I'll meet them.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.687
It doesn't matter which one you choose.
It's up to you.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.273
Our guy is perfect.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.692
Or you could go out with the guy
Phoebe deemed...

14:20.860 --> 14:23.736
...not good enough to go out with herself.
- Ugh!

14:23.904 --> 14:26.155
Phoebe, there you are!
Okay, you broke my fridge.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.241
You owe me 400 bucks.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.786
- Okay, sure.
- Really?

14:32.705 --> 14:36.666
Ooh, technically, you owe me $600
for sending out happy thoughts...

14:36.834 --> 14:38.835
...on your last 10 auditions.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.508
Call it even?

14:46.969 --> 14:48.636
Okay.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.891
There you are.
So, what did Elizabeth say?

14:53.058 --> 14:58.021
Well, turns out she is going to Daytona
for "spring break, woo-hoo."

14:58.188 --> 15:02.150
That means wet T-shirt contests,
guys doing shots off of girls' bodies...

15:02.318 --> 15:04.485
...waking up next to people
you don't even know.

15:04.653 --> 15:07.405
Man, she is gonna have a great time!

15:09.116 --> 15:11.784
Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?

15:11.952 --> 15:14.996
- You know the hotels?
- I was there, Spring Break '81!

15:16.749 --> 15:19.083
In 1981, you were 13.

15:19.251 --> 15:22.420
So what? I drove down,
sold T-shirts. I had a blast.

15:22.588 --> 15:26.799
You know who knows how to party?
Drunk college chicks.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.929
Okay, she can't go.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.973
You can't tell her not to go.
You just started dating.

15:34.141 --> 15:37.185
- Then what am I supposed to do?
- Nothing. Just be cool with it.

15:37.353 --> 15:40.188
What if she goes down there
and sleeps with a bunch of guys?

15:40.356 --> 15:43.024
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.909
I'm so glad you're going on this trip.

15:53.077 --> 15:56.579
Yeah, I've been working
so hard this semester.

15:56.747 --> 15:59.374
I really need to go crazy, you know?
Blow off some steam.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.501
Sure. Sure.

16:02.795 --> 16:07.256
Look, I don't know if your plans
are finalized yet...

16:07.424 --> 16:10.343
...but I know another great way
to blow off steam.

16:10.511 --> 16:13.429
- What?
- Are you into crafts at all?

16:15.349 --> 16:18.351
- Ross, are you okay?
- Uh, yeah. Of course I'm okay.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.979
Heh, I'm just being, uh, supportive.

16:21.146 --> 16:24.065
Supportive of you and this whole trip...

16:24.233 --> 16:27.276
...and what... What is, uh...? What's this?

16:29.363 --> 16:33.116
- It's a bathing suit?
- To wear in front of people?

16:34.451 --> 16:36.953
- Is that supportive?
- Is this?

16:39.623 --> 16:41.124
- Hey.
- Good, good, good.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.542
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.752
- We're glad you decided to meet our guy.
- Oh.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.587
You're gonna like him so much.

16:46.755 --> 16:49.382
- Uh, when do you want to meet him?
- I don't know.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.760
- I don't work late tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow night is good.

16:52.928 --> 16:56.973
But why put off something till tomorrow
that you can do right now. Ha-ha-ha.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.975
- Eldad, come here!
- What?

17:00.227 --> 17:02.895
- Eldad, this is Rachel.
- How are you?

17:03.063 --> 17:05.481
A little blind-sided,
but, you know, good.

17:06.567 --> 17:10.069
Eldad, sit down. Move over.
Move over now.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.155
There you go. There you are.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.950
- Okay, we can take a hint!
- Ha-ha-ha.

17:16.952 --> 17:20.413
- Wait. What are you doing here?
- This is Patrick.

17:20.580 --> 17:21.789
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:21.957 --> 17:24.584
You're too late,
because she's already with our guy.

17:24.752 --> 17:29.547
Oh, my God, you're right, I am too late.
They're sitting on the couch and talking.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.549
Come on.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.303
- Rachel? This is Patrick.
- Yeah?

17:35.471 --> 17:36.721
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.973
This is the guy
I was telling you about.

17:39.141 --> 17:43.102
Believe me, this suit does not do justice
to what's underneath it.

17:44.271 --> 17:45.730
Okay.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.734
But Pheebs, I'm just sort of
in the middle of something.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.487
Oh, okay. That's okay. Have a seat.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.615
- You can't do that!
- Maybe I should go.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.867
Just sit down, we're winning.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.912
Okay, you know what?
Maybe I should go.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.914
- No, no!
- Have a seat!

18:03.082 --> 18:05.666
Rachel, you haven't touched
Eldad's hair.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.920
- It is the softest hair. Touch it.
- I'm good.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.131
Rachel, Patrick is really rich.
Give her some money.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.762
Phoebe, this isn't really worth
the free massage.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.014
That's right, Patrick. Bye-bye.

18:20.182 --> 18:23.309
Eldad is much more cooperative
and he can dance.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.478
You dance for Rachel.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.980
No, don't dance for me, please!

18:28.148 --> 18:30.316
What is the matter with you guys?

18:30.484 --> 18:32.443
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.

18:33.237 --> 18:36.030
Am I the only one
that this is embarrassing for?

18:36.198 --> 18:39.158
- I'm a little embarrassed.
- Shh, shh.

18:40.202 --> 18:44.413
I'll tell you who should be embarrassed.
It's you guys. This is ridiculous!

18:44.581 --> 18:46.916
Thank you,
but I do not need you to get me a date.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.585
- Then why did she ask us to help...
- I am still talking!

18:49.753 --> 18:52.880
Then you chase away
the one guy that I actually liked.

18:53.048 --> 18:56.509
No offense to you guys.
Really, congratulations on...

18:56.677 --> 18:58.719
...all the cash.

18:58.887 --> 19:02.098
And you really...
Wow, you do have very soft hair.

19:02.266 --> 19:07.520
But I'd much rather go to the ball by myself
than go through any more of this!

19:07.688 --> 19:09.355
Goodbye.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.443
Now, do you use some sort
of special conditioner on that hair?

19:15.112 --> 19:17.822
- Yes, papaya extract.
- Thank you.

19:23.203 --> 19:27.123
- So, uh, have a great time down there.
- I will.

19:27.291 --> 19:30.209
- Did you pack that bathing suit?
- Yeah.

19:30.377 --> 19:33.004
It was pretty funny
when I hid it for a while, huh?

19:36.675 --> 19:39.010
Anyway. Um...

19:39.178 --> 19:41.721
I am worried about that bathing suit.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.765
Not because it's revealing,
which I'm fine with.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.393
No, I'm concerned about your health.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.188
Um, sun exposure.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.565
Oh, don't worry,
I have plenty of sun block.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.609
- It's SPF 30.
- All right.

19:54.776 --> 19:57.820
Well, if what's in the bottle
is actually 30.

19:57.988 --> 20:01.282
I mean, sometimes you get 30,
sometimes it's 4, and I swear...

20:01.450 --> 20:03.826
...more often than not, it's just milk.

20:04.828 --> 20:07.538
Ross, it's gonna be okay.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.917
I'm not going down there
to hook up with a bunch of guys.

20:11.084 --> 20:14.712
I really like you.
I like how things are going between us.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.380
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.508
I'm just going down there to relax
and hang out with my friends.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.137
Okay. Cool. Heh.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.556
- Oh, here they are.
- Hey, Elizabeth!

20:29.811 --> 20:31.187
Bye!

20:37.277 --> 20:38.861
Call me!

20:44.618 --> 20:47.245
Rachel, we're sorry
for pushing those guys on you.

20:47.412 --> 20:50.122
That's all right.
I ended up having a really good time.

20:50.290 --> 20:54.752
The charity was a big success,
they raised a lot of money and awareness.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.338
So, what was it for, anyway?

20:58.298 --> 21:00.466
I wanna say a disease.

21:02.719 --> 21:03.928
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:04.096 --> 21:08.432
I just got this weird message from Ross.
He said turn on MTV. I don't know.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.607
- Oh, my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Ha-ha-ha.

21:24.700 --> 21:28.244
Oh, oh, Professor Geller.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.040
Ah, to be 13 again.
