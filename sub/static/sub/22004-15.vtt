WEBVTT

00:08.609 --> 00:09.610
Order up.

00:14.715 --> 00:17.051
I got a bad feeling about this,
for real.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.552
Ever since I woke up
this morning.

00:18.586 --> 00:21.189
Relax, Cyrus.

00:21.222 --> 00:24.358
Eat your biscuits and gravy.
It'll calm your nerves.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.460
This dude Belanger is bad news.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.796
Where's your FBI backup?

00:28.829 --> 00:30.798
What if he spots them?
Gets spooked.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.066
He won't.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.702
No one to spot.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.404
I'm on my own here.

00:36.437 --> 00:37.638
You're kidding.
It's like you said,

00:37.671 --> 00:38.706
we don't want to spook this guy.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.208
If this goes wrong...

00:40.241 --> 00:41.542
If this goes wrong,
then we're both screwed,

00:41.575 --> 00:43.711
so calm down and eat
your damn biscuits.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.086
Uh, hey, Belanger.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.155
Uh, this is my boy
I was telling you about.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.423
Ray Jones.

00:55.456 --> 00:58.592
Okay, Ray Jones.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.132
Why are we here?

01:05.499 --> 01:07.568
He say he got a piece
of work lined up...

01:07.601 --> 01:09.637
Cyrus, I'm talking to Ray.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.644
Cyrus says that
you're a wheelman.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.280
Says you need reliable muscle
for a job that starts tomorrow.

01:19.313 --> 01:20.814
That's me.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.317
And what qualifies you?

01:23.351 --> 01:26.154
Ever heard of "Shock and Awe"?

01:26.187 --> 01:29.157
Armored truck robberies
out of Virginia.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.892
Crew was no joke.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.695
But you are.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.664
Only people ever called
that crew Shock and Awe

01:36.697 --> 01:37.798
were the freaking cops.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.700
Hey, Cyrus, what is this?

01:39.733 --> 01:40.768
Come on, Belanger,

01:40.801 --> 01:42.836
you know I wouldn't bring
the cops to meet you.

01:42.870 --> 01:43.804
Yeah, 'cause you know
I'd do this.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.339
Oh!

01:49.577 --> 01:51.412
Call 911 now!

02:34.588 --> 02:36.324
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

02:54.608 --> 02:56.444
Hands where we can see them!

02:56.477 --> 02:59.513
Okay, okay, don't shoot.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.288
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

03:08.256 --> 03:10.858
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

03:10.891 --> 03:13.361
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

03:13.394 --> 03:14.662
* How, how, how, how

03:14.695 --> 03:16.830
* Hey, hey

03:22.870 --> 03:24.238
* You gotta come on.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.915
Oh, my goodness.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.854
-Raymond.
-Dwayne.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.459
I appreciate you
calling me, Francine.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.860
You mind giving us a moment?

03:46.894 --> 03:48.262
Mm-hmm.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.004
Busy day, huh?

03:57.037 --> 03:58.539
I know it looks bad.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.708
Ah, well...

04:00.741 --> 04:02.976
You were involved in the
shooting of a federal informant.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.612
They told me that Cyrus
is gonna make it.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.647
And you were arrested
two miles away

04:06.680 --> 04:09.850
after engaging the suspect,
Donny Belanger,

04:09.883 --> 04:11.485
in a high-speed chase.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.353
I almost had him.

04:12.386 --> 04:15.323
You were armed,
but without credentials.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.826
Neglected to identify yourself
as an FBI agent.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.894
They got my I.D.
when they pulled my prints.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.631
And you asked
the arresting officers

04:23.664 --> 04:25.866
not to notify the New Orleans
FBI field office,

04:25.899 --> 04:28.802
but instead call me.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.471
Couldn't trust anyone else.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.006
What exactly are you up to?
A case.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.477
Big one.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.946
And, technically,

04:38.979 --> 04:41.549
the FBI doesn't know
I'm working it.

04:41.582 --> 04:45.953
Man in the hospital
with a gunshot wound,

04:45.986 --> 04:47.888
suspect got away.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.890
I have pull with NOPD,

04:49.923 --> 04:51.892
but not enough to keep this
from your bosses.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.827
Well, I was hoping that you
could stall them long enough

04:53.861 --> 04:54.995
for us to find Belanger.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.830
Us?
Dwayne.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.333
This is important.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.068
I need your help.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.413
PRIDE: Love what you've done
with the place, Raymond.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.515
It's very homey.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.917
I have no intention of
making a home here, Dwayne.

05:16.950 --> 05:21.355
Aw, why? At least
make it comfortable. I...

05:21.389 --> 05:23.724
When we're done with the case,
I'll buy a plant.

05:25.459 --> 05:28.829
This is what I've
been working on.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.603
Series of "last-mile
truck heists"

05:35.636 --> 05:37.137
pulled over the past two years.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.707
And I've been working on this
ever since I got down here.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.075
Okay, so what
are they...

05:42.109 --> 05:43.544
Opioids.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.446
Straight from
the manufacturers.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.914
The trucks are hit

05:46.947 --> 05:48.949
right before their
drugstore deliveries.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.951
Four-man takedown crews,

05:50.984 --> 05:53.921
targeting high-value drugs:
oxycodone,

05:53.954 --> 05:56.023
hydromorphone, fentanyl.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.625
$30 million worth.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.893
Why haven't FBI and DEA
investigated?

05:59.927 --> 06:01.462
Because it's under the radar.

06:01.495 --> 06:04.432
Never the same crew, never
the same jurisdiction.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.867
And no single heist
takes a haul large enough

06:06.900 --> 06:08.902
to warrant federal intervention.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.605
But you think...
it's connected.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.641
Case by case,
there's not much to go on,

06:13.674 --> 06:14.908
but as a whole?

06:14.942 --> 06:16.610
Big picture?

06:16.644 --> 06:18.145
There's a pattern.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.449
The getaway cars.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.050
Always late model sedans,

06:23.083 --> 06:24.818
always fall off the grid
a few miles from the heist,

06:24.852 --> 06:27.655
and always when they're headed
in the same direction...

06:27.688 --> 06:28.922
New Orleans.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.826
What happened when you brought
this to D.C.'s attention?

06:32.860 --> 06:34.662
Tilting at windmills.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.630
Jockeying for my
old position back.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.899
They told me to
stay in my lane.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.901
Uh-huh.
Heard that before.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.970
But considering
all the trouble you've been in,

06:43.003 --> 06:46.039
including today,
maybe you should listen.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.912
When I was a rookie...

06:51.945 --> 06:55.783
someone close to me
got injured on the job.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.918
Got hooked on pills.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.653
Devastated him.

06:59.687 --> 07:02.890
Nearly destroyed his career
and his life, and...

07:04.057 --> 07:06.460
No, I-I can't let this sit.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.900
Okay.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.037
Okay, Raymond.

07:17.070 --> 07:20.674
So, tell me, what happened
at the restaurant?

07:20.708 --> 07:25.613
Belanger is hiring talent
for a pharma truck heist.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.214
Needs muscle fast.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.949
It connects.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.851
So you went solo,

07:30.884 --> 07:34.121
and Belanger pegged you
as law enforcement.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.557
He's the only lead I have to
figuring out who's behind this.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.125
I got to find him.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.993
I need your team to do it.

07:40.027 --> 07:44.064
You're asking us to join an
unsanctioned FBI investigation

07:44.097 --> 07:46.867
with no NCIS ties?
No.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.736
I'm asking you to sanction it.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.137
Look.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.241
Petty Officer Todd Walsh,

07:54.274 --> 07:56.276
based out of Belle Chasse,

07:56.309 --> 07:59.747
died of an opioid
overdose-- fentanyl.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.616
You're thinking the pills came
from one of these heists?

08:02.650 --> 08:04.117
Oh, I'm sure of it.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.153
And that would make this...

08:06.186 --> 08:08.856
an NCIS investigation.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.127
LASALLE:
Don't understand, King.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.996
Petty Officer Walsh
died six months ago--

08:16.029 --> 08:17.665
how'd we land this
case overnight?

08:17.698 --> 08:19.667
It was brought
to my attention

08:19.700 --> 08:22.770
that Walsh's death might connect
to the heists I sent your way.

08:22.803 --> 08:25.072
By who?
Isler.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.275
Case is a political hot potato
for him, so we're pinch-hitting.

08:28.308 --> 08:31.712
Sounds like a political way of
saying the FBI doesn't approve.

08:31.745 --> 08:34.848
Should we be doing this after
D.C.'s finally off our ass?

08:34.882 --> 08:37.551
Well, Isler caught a raw deal
getting sent down here.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.287
He's helped us in the past,
and we should do likewise.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.822
And why not enjoy
the sweet irony

08:41.855 --> 08:42.856
of him needing our help again?

08:42.890 --> 08:45.092
Gonna lord it over
him for years.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.795
I spent the morning
crossing T's and dotting I's

08:47.828 --> 08:49.930
with the local
New Orleans field office.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.665
We're good
to pursue the case.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.834
Isler's cleared
to join us.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.035
Okay?

08:55.068 --> 08:56.036
What have you learned?
Ms. Loretta's

08:56.069 --> 08:57.805
looking into
Walsh's overdose

08:57.838 --> 08:59.873
to see if it connects
to one of these heists.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.675
Patton's digging
into Isler's research.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.944
Maybe help us identify
some of the suspects.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.246
That leaves Donny Belanger,
our missing driver.

09:06.279 --> 09:10.083
And our only link
to any of the heists.

09:10.117 --> 09:13.587
SONJA: Belanger's a Louisiana
native and NASCAR washout.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.022
Turned his obsession
for fast cars

09:15.055 --> 09:16.990
into a career
as a getaway driver.

09:17.024 --> 09:17.891
Did time for assault,

09:17.925 --> 09:19.693
grand theft auto,
weapons possession.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.929
Now, he's supposed to be
serving probation in Lafayette,

09:21.962 --> 09:23.697
but he's been off the grid
for months.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.365
Yeah, I mean,
there's been a few sightings

09:25.398 --> 09:27.100
in New Orleans,
but nothing since yesterday.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.269
I mean, this guy's really good
at not being found.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.871
Well, if we can't find him,

09:30.904 --> 09:32.806
what about his car, the Charger?

09:32.840 --> 09:35.042
Well, Sebastian processed
the scene of the escape.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.877
Pulled cameras from the area,

09:36.910 --> 09:38.779
but the trail went cold
when Belanger

09:38.812 --> 09:41.214
blew through a fence
and cut across a levee.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.383
That's rough terrain
for a factory sedan

09:43.416 --> 09:44.985
to be crossing
at top speeds,

09:45.018 --> 09:47.254
especially after he
took a 70-foot dive.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.956
All right.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.058
I'll meet Isler at the lab,

09:51.091 --> 09:54.127
see what Loretta
and Sebastian came up with.

09:54.161 --> 09:57.665
Meantime, keep on the hunt
for Belanger.

09:57.698 --> 10:00.167
Check on the BOLO.
Knock on doors.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.136
He's out there somewhere.

10:03.170 --> 10:06.974
WADE: I pulled Petty Officer
Walsh's autopsy file

10:07.007 --> 10:08.809
and tox screen.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.878
The chemical signature
of the pills he took

10:10.911 --> 10:13.747
match those stolen from one
of your heists in Tennessee.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.248
I knew those drugs
were coming into New Orleans.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.317
Yes, and Walsh
is not the only victim.

10:17.350 --> 10:20.688
I pulled a half a dozen
other fentanyl overdose files.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.289
Those drugs are killing people.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.257
We'll shut them
down, Loretta.
Yeah, we better.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.695
Otherwise, I'm gonna start
running out of lockers.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.131
ISLER:
I hope that smile means

10:31.164 --> 10:32.866
you found me a lead,
Special Agent Lund.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.268
Uh, no. This smile is
'cause I've been watching

10:35.302 --> 10:37.738
the greatest car chases
in film history.

10:37.771 --> 10:38.772
Thought you were supposed to be

10:38.806 --> 10:40.207
finding Belanger's car,
Sebastian.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.341
Yeah, I was.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.843
I mean I am. I--
right this--

10:42.876 --> 10:44.344
yeah. Right now.
This is research. Here.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.979
Uh, Belanger's
jump, you know,

10:46.013 --> 10:47.948
was straight out of
The Fast and the Furious.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.316
Which one?

10:49.349 --> 10:51.752
Well, take your pick.

10:51.785 --> 10:52.986
I mean, personally,
my favorite,

10:53.020 --> 10:54.154
that's Fast Five.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.889
'Cause that chase
in Rio, remember?

10:55.923 --> 10:56.824
Man, that thing. And then,

10:56.857 --> 10:57.691
Tokyo Drift on
the other hand...

10:57.725 --> 10:59.226
But we digress.
We do.
You're right.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.093
The point is that

11:00.127 --> 11:01.862
there's no way
that Belanger's Charger

11:01.895 --> 11:03.797
could have survived
the impact from that dive

11:03.831 --> 11:05.833
unless it had been
heavily modified.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.100
Custom work.
Tons.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.902
Talking, you know,
reinforced frame,

11:08.936 --> 11:10.437
extended wheelbase,
heavy-duty tires

11:10.470 --> 11:11.972
on heavy-duty wells...

11:12.005 --> 11:13.741
How does this help us
track Belanger?

11:13.774 --> 11:17.210
I don't think that the Charger
entirely survived the jump.

11:17.244 --> 11:18.478
I found motor oil

11:18.511 --> 11:19.813
at the impact site,

11:19.847 --> 11:21.815
probably from
a-a cracked oil pan.

11:21.849 --> 11:22.983
ISLER:
Okay.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.451
So it's leaking oil.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.153
It is, but it's not
just any oil.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.789
Regal Purple 5W-30.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.124
High viscosity for
performance vehicles.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.827
This is very hard to find,
and it's very expensive.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.963
You just don't pick this up
at a Pep Boys.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.497
So you're saying
he needs this stuff.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.767
Yeah, he can't get far without
a new oil pan and a top-off.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.934
ISLER:
Okay.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.235
So we're looking
for an auto shop

11:42.269 --> 11:44.104
that sells Regal Purple
but also performs

11:44.137 --> 11:46.139
specialty repairs
on custom cars.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.141
Yes. And the good thing is that
there are only three places

11:48.175 --> 11:49.977
in New Orleans
where you can get that.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.178
PRIDE: Ah, that's
good work.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.412
Let's divide and conquer.

11:52.445 --> 11:55.015
Send me those, Sebastian.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.193
LASALLE:
There's the Charger.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.061
Yeah. Keep your eyes open.
Belanger can't be far.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.997
BELANGER: Thought you were gonna
put two guys on it.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.364
This is my best guy.
Him?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.532
What, is he new?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.935
Donny Belanger? NCIS.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.736
LASALLE: Hands where
we can see them.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.044
He's got a gun!

12:27.981 --> 12:28.949
Don't move!

12:31.952 --> 12:35.422
Pretty sure he ain't going
anywhere, New York.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.241
Okay, Belanger.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.309
Time to talk.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.245
Unless one of you guys
has a medical degree,

12:58.278 --> 13:00.848
I'm not saying a damn thing.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.482
My arm is broken.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.217
And I'm not feeling a lot
of sympathy for the guy

13:04.251 --> 13:05.585
who shot my C.I.,

13:05.618 --> 13:07.420
and attempted to shoot
two federal agents today.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.356
This is police brutality.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.491
PRIDE: EMTs
stabilized your arm.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.961
We'll get you a doctor as soon
as you get us some names.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.229
Everyone involved
in these truck heists,

13:16.263 --> 13:18.065
or you take the fall alone.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.499
Well, here's the thing.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.034
I'm terrible with names,

13:21.068 --> 13:22.936
and I don't respond to threats.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.572
This is not a threat.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.575
You're looking at ten
to 15 years, mandatory.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.610
Consider me informed.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.912
Now about that doctor.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.180
You don't want to...

13:33.213 --> 13:34.982
Oh, God!
Hey, Ray.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.249
Whoa, oh, wow.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.918
That arm is a lot worse
than I thought, Pride.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.453
I think that bone
is shattered.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.522
Like I said, it needs attention.

13:42.555 --> 13:45.125
Sure.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.460
But not from just any doctor.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.865
You need an expert orthopedist.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.967
What are y'all talking about?

13:54.001 --> 13:55.869
Surgery, probably.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.104
Otherwise you'll lose
use of that arm.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.305
They might even
need to take it.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.606
You know, the head

13:59.639 --> 14:02.442
of orthopedic surgery
at LSU is a friend.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.145
I could make a call to Dr. Zura.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.014
If you had a reason to.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.249
If I had good reason to.
Yeah.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.354
Look.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.491
I don't know much.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.527
Last week, this guy reaches out.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.529
His name's Hal Cranston.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.131
We did a bit at
Angola together.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.233
He says he's got
a one-time job.

14:26.266 --> 14:29.970
Big money, low risk,
boosting pharma-grade opioids.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.039
He said I'd be
the wheelman.

14:32.072 --> 14:32.672
He had muscle,

14:32.705 --> 14:34.207
needed one more guy.

14:34.241 --> 14:35.675
When's this job going down?

14:35.708 --> 14:38.511
Supposed to meet up this
afternoon, go over the plan.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.915
Clearly, I'm
otherwise engaged.

14:41.949 --> 14:44.151
Now, about that doctor friend.

14:44.184 --> 14:48.088
First, you're gonna tell us
where and when the meet is.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.025
Then we'll deal with the arm.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.099
Hal Cranston's a
stickup man by trade.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.168
Served multiple stretches
for armed robbery--

15:01.201 --> 15:04.337
couple of jewelry stores,
truck hijacking;

15:04.371 --> 15:05.973
smash and grab, mostly.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.274
He's no criminal mastermind.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.242
Yeah, scope of these drug heists
is too complex

15:09.276 --> 15:10.643
for a thug like Cranston.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.145
He's working for someone.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.947
All right, so we
bring him in, right?

15:13.981 --> 15:15.115
Get him to roll on his boss?

15:15.148 --> 15:16.649
We'll need leverage to do that.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.418
Right now, all we got
is Belanger's word.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.153
PRIDE:
We got something else.

15:20.187 --> 15:23.090
Cranston needs a driver
and a takedown man.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.257
We can deliver both.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.592
What are you thinking, King?

15:25.625 --> 15:26.960
I'm thinking Sonja

15:26.994 --> 15:27.995
has access to clean

15:28.028 --> 15:28.996
ATF covers.

15:29.029 --> 15:32.665
You two go in as replacement
driver and muscle.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.068
Catch Cranston
while planning the heist,

15:35.102 --> 15:36.503
force him to give up his boss.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.138
Sounds like a plan.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.739
One small adjustment.
Hmm?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.975
I'm going in as the muscle
instead of Lasalle.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.011
PRIDE:
Raymond.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.278
Listen.
Look.

15:45.312 --> 15:48.048
I started this thing, I should
be the one to see it through.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.517
Right, but you were made
within a minute at that diner.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.152
You reek of cop.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.386
Error in judgment yesterday.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.088
It won't happen again.
Right.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.089
'Cause you're not
going undercover.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.125
Look, I've been working on this

15:58.158 --> 15:59.126
on my own for months,

15:59.159 --> 16:00.994
putting the pieces to...

16:01.028 --> 16:02.229
This is my case.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.131
Technically, it's ours now.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.299
Look, I'm not sitting back

16:06.333 --> 16:08.035
and letting anyone else
be put in danger.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.536
SONJA: Well,
just to be clear,

16:09.569 --> 16:12.105
you wouldn't put
Lasalle in danger,

16:12.139 --> 16:14.307
but I will be there, too.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.542
PRIDE:
Percy.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.577
Hang on.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.150
Operation carries a lot
of risks, Raymond.

16:23.183 --> 16:26.286
I am well aware of
the risks, Dwayne.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.456
This is too important to me.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.732
Isler goes undercover
with Sonja.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.701
Gregorio,
Christopher,

16:41.734 --> 16:43.270
we need recon
at the meet.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.338
Check out the location.
You're the backup.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.807
Sebastian, we'll coordinate
comms from here.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.043
SONJA:
I don't like this.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.778
He's not ready.

16:51.811 --> 16:52.712
Hey. I'm standing right here.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.048
Okay. Look.

16:55.082 --> 16:56.549
You have a few hours.
Get him ready.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.085
What if I can't?

17:01.721 --> 17:03.790
Then it's your call to pull him.

17:05.725 --> 17:08.795
Oh.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.030
Well, I guess you're with me.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.640
ISLER: I'm Alton Webber from
Detroit. I came to New Orleans

17:20.673 --> 17:22.709
ten years ago
as a mud-man on the derricks.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.144
I tore my ACL,

17:24.177 --> 17:25.745
lost my job,
had to make ends meet.

17:25.778 --> 17:29.482
I'm good with a gun,
and I don't get nervous.

17:29.516 --> 17:30.717
Bang, you're dead.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.119
Hey. Percy.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.453
That was letter perfect.
Come on.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.787
That's the problem.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.556
You're all head and no heart.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.326
Okay? It's not enough
to say the words,

17:39.359 --> 17:41.294
you got to believe them.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.332
And get rid of the hat,
it's ridiculous.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.733
I got this, all right?

17:46.766 --> 17:48.768
Not a question
of your enthusiasm.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.738
Look, we don't have time, okay?
The meet happens in an hour.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.106
Doesn't have to
happen with you.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.108
Wa-Wait.
Look,

17:55.142 --> 17:57.510
last person you worked with got
shot at point-blank range.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.546
I'm in no hurry
to take a bullet.
Okay, look.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.813
Hey, hey, I can do it again.

18:00.847 --> 18:01.814
All right, let me
do it again.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.150
I can do it,
I can do it better.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.384
I'm focused, I'm in control,
all right?

18:04.417 --> 18:06.853
I don't need focus
and control.

18:06.886 --> 18:10.590
I need you to say
one authentic thing

18:10.623 --> 18:13.526
that tells me
you're Alton Webber.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.833
I like pills.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.836
That's really how
I lost my job.

18:25.872 --> 18:29.776
After the injury,
I was high all the time.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.345
There was an accident

18:32.379 --> 18:34.181
on the derricks.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.616
A man almost died.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.921
It was because of me.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.857
Look, I'm sober now,

18:44.891 --> 18:47.627
but, uh...

18:47.660 --> 18:51.364
I-I almost lost everything.

18:51.398 --> 18:54.267
Family, work.

18:54.301 --> 18:56.203
Friends.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.175
And that was 15 years ago,

19:02.209 --> 19:05.212
and I haven't had
so much as an aspirin since.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.849
Well, damn.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.818
Where was that
in Alton Webber's file?

19:11.851 --> 19:14.354
It wasn't.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.456
I improvised.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.226
Well, if we can get
a little more of that,

19:19.259 --> 19:21.861
we might have a fighting chance.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.330
Now let's go over it
one more time.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.565
Okay.
But this time...

19:25.598 --> 19:26.866
with feeling.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.670
I'm Alton Webber from Detroit.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.540
I came to New Orleans
ten years ago.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.644
I don't like this position.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.979
There's too much distance
in case they need backup.

19:40.012 --> 19:40.880
Only place with cover.

19:40.913 --> 19:41.981
Otherwise, we get spotted.

19:42.014 --> 19:42.982
I know it.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.384
I just don't like it.

19:45.585 --> 19:46.919
We're set, Pride.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.856
All right, signal's clear.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.824
We got audio and visuals.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.526
PRIDE:
All right, everyone.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.562
NOPD's a mile away.

19:55.595 --> 19:58.698
This gets messy,
we call in the cavalry.

19:58.731 --> 19:59.899
Are we expecting messy?

19:59.932 --> 20:01.901
Not if Sonja did her job.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.871
GREGORIO:
Here comes the Charger.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.948
Not sure what hurts
more, my arm

20:15.982 --> 20:18.518
or my ears after hearing you
strip my transmission.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.353
Okay, first of all, it's not
your transmission anymore.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.721
Your gear is sticking.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.556
You need to learn how to...
ISLER: Hey.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.258
Stop talking.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.659
Are you ready?

20:28.995 --> 20:30.563
You're late.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.647
Okay, they're in.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.982
Whoa, whoa.
We just lost image and sound.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.320
Christopher, Gregorio?

20:54.454 --> 20:56.789
What? We got nothing.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.658
Lost contact with NCIS

20:58.691 --> 21:00.026
and the audio inside
the building.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.260
I don't know what's happening.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.967
Well, I hope I'm gonna get
a receipt for those.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.037
Get your personal items
back later.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.672
The hell happened to you?

21:12.705 --> 21:14.941
Broke my arm.
I can see that, genius.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.544
Got you the car like I said.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.946
Tori here's the second-best
driver in town.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.715
Check out the size
on my man, Webber.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.519
Can't fault your work ethic,
Belanger.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.054
But you brought two strangers
to the meet.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.589
That's unacceptable.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.926
And you...

21:33.960 --> 21:36.062
you got five seconds
to convince me you're not a cop.

21:49.509 --> 21:50.710
Okay, hold on.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.011
Let's take a beat there, friend.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.580
I'm not your friend.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.815
I don't know you,
and this guy's got cop eyes.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.817
Okay, well, we don't
know you, either,

21:57.850 --> 21:59.586
but I thought that
was the whole point of this job.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.521
This is the part where you
convince me you're on the level.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.556
SONJA: Nah, we came
here to do work.

22:03.590 --> 22:06.526
Now, if you not offering that,
we'll bounce.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.828
Ain't that right, Alton?

22:08.861 --> 22:10.530
Five...

22:10.563 --> 22:11.764
Why did we lost comms,
Sebastian?

22:11.798 --> 22:13.533
I don't know,
Cranston must have engaged

22:13.566 --> 22:15.402
some sort of short-range
signal jammer

22:15.435 --> 22:16.736
inside the building.
Well, can you counteract it?

22:16.769 --> 22:17.737
Yeah, yeah,
I'm trying, I'm trying.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.071
That's four.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.508
Tell him, Alton.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.943
King, do you read me
Phones aren't working, either.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.745
Dude, I wouldn't
bring a cop.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.380
Dude, we both know you'd do

22:27.414 --> 22:29.048
whatever it takes
to save your ass.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.583
LASALLE:
All right, I'm pulling

22:30.617 --> 22:32.585
the plug-- we're going in.
No, no. No, hold on.

22:32.619 --> 22:33.553
Let's get eyes inside
the warehouse first,

22:33.586 --> 22:34.687
see what's happening.
All right, you're right.

22:34.721 --> 22:37.023
You can make me waste a bullet,
but I won't waste time

22:37.056 --> 22:38.691
digging a grave.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.560
Yeah? Then let's get to it.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.462
Three, two, one.
Pull the trigger.

22:42.495 --> 22:43.563
Time's up.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.598
Just make sure
you take me out.

22:45.632 --> 22:48.000
See, I've been shot before,
by an actual cop.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.537
But he couldn't close the deal;
I took his gun...

22:50.570 --> 22:52.605
left him in a ditch.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.675
Load of crap.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.410
Let's play it out.

22:57.444 --> 22:59.011
Where you going?

23:11.691 --> 23:13.960
You're crazy, man.

23:13.993 --> 23:16.563
I love it.

23:16.596 --> 23:17.630
So we cool?

23:17.664 --> 23:18.731
Totally.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.533
The both of you.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.636
This job's gonna
be a blast.

23:25.938 --> 23:28.140
I had to prove a point.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.677
No hard feelings?

23:30.710 --> 23:33.045
Whatever, man.

23:33.079 --> 23:36.583
BELANGER: Somebody, somebody
want to help me out here?

23:36.616 --> 23:39.051
I think you cracked my skull.

23:39.085 --> 23:39.886
Suck it up.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.020
We're on a schedule.

23:41.053 --> 23:43.856
You stay put.
We got a job to do.

23:43.890 --> 23:46.926
Uh, we

23:46.959 --> 23:48.495
Only way the boss does it.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.530
We meet, hit the
road, do the work.

23:50.563 --> 23:52.765
No second-guessing,
no loose lips.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.133
Help me with the gear.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.238
Looks like they're in.
Let's keep trying to get Pride.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.173
We're good.

24:01.207 --> 24:02.942
CRANSTON:
All right, let's go. Load up.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.177
Pride. Signal's back.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.147
So, uh...

24:08.180 --> 24:10.850
where is this job, anyway?

24:10.883 --> 24:13.152
No idea.
Charlie's gonna

24:13.185 --> 24:14.987
tell us everything.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.022
Who's Charlie?

24:16.055 --> 24:17.690
The Wizard of frickin' Oz.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.093
PRIDE: Christopher, Gregorio,
you there?

24:21.127 --> 24:23.029
Yeah, we're here.
We lost you for a second.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.196
Sebastian thinks that Cranston

24:24.230 --> 24:26.198
has some kind
of a signal blocker.

24:26.232 --> 24:27.600
It looks like
Isler and Sonja

24:27.634 --> 24:28.434
are all right.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.702
GREGORIO:
Yeah, they're fine now.

24:29.736 --> 24:31.137
They survived the interview.

24:31.170 --> 24:32.639
LASALLE:
But we got a problem, King.

24:32.672 --> 24:33.906
The job is happening now.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.175
As in now now, like right now?

24:36.208 --> 24:38.745
Yeah, now, now, Sebastian.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.212
Well, we-we got to call NOPD.

24:40.246 --> 24:43.015
We don't have much
to charge them with.

24:43.049 --> 24:45.284
Conspiracy, maybe.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.153
LASALLE: There's something else
you should know, King.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.756
Cranston's getting instructions
on a special phone

24:49.789 --> 24:51.257
from a guy named Charlie.

24:51.290 --> 24:52.759
Yeah. Seems like the shot caller

24:52.792 --> 24:54.126
on these heists.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.262
What if we just
let this play out?

24:56.295 --> 24:57.964
You-you want them
to rob the truck?

24:57.997 --> 24:59.666
No, I want to get to Charlie.

24:59.699 --> 25:02.835
If he's the boss and we
can wrap him up in this, then...

25:03.970 --> 25:05.805
Lasalle, Gregorio,
let this ride.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.139
But stay close.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.242
You got it.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.522
What are we gonna do
with this guy?

25:24.824 --> 25:26.726
You leaving me here?
Shut up.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.961
NOPD's on their way
to pick you up.

25:28.995 --> 25:31.130
Gregorio! We got to move.

25:32.932 --> 25:35.167
This is not cool at all.

25:38.337 --> 25:40.773
Hey!

25:40.807 --> 25:42.942
This is not cool!

25:44.343 --> 25:45.645
These guys literally
just met,

25:45.678 --> 25:46.813
and they're about
to hijack a truck?

25:46.846 --> 25:49.348
Yeah. Whatever
this Charlie's doing...

25:49.381 --> 25:51.684
it's been working for two years.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.352
How can he keep his crews
in the dark like this?

25:53.385 --> 25:55.221
He's gaming
the system.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.189
Sounds like you
found something, P.
Yeah.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.991
I went down the rabbit hole
on each heist

25:59.025 --> 26:00.226
that Isler was investigating.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.361
Evidence, police comms,

26:02.394 --> 26:04.196
escape routes.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.666
They were all over the place--
through back roads, tiny towns.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.034
That's how the getaway cars

26:08.067 --> 26:09.268
drop off the radar.

26:09.301 --> 26:10.269
And when they
resurface...

26:10.302 --> 26:12.639
Always in a new jurisdiction.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.273
Law enforcement loses
Charlie's crews

26:14.306 --> 26:15.775
and they hand off across city,

26:15.808 --> 26:17.343
county, even-- look--
even state lines.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.178
The crews know
where the police are gonna be

26:19.211 --> 26:20.346
before the police do.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.214
Maybe Charlie's
some sort of a cop.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.349
Maybe he's gaming

26:23.382 --> 26:26.285
the system,
because he knows the system.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.387
How to avoid detection,
which drugs to steal,

26:28.420 --> 26:31.090
and what amount to steer clear
of federal intervention.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.259
A cop could also access
encrypted police signals,

26:33.292 --> 26:35.928
guiding his crew
around roadblocks.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.797
Which he does
using modified cars

26:37.830 --> 26:39.832
that can travel
across any terrain.

26:39.866 --> 26:41.067
All right, look, I'm
gonna stay on the line

26:41.100 --> 26:42.635
with Lasalle
and Gregorio.

26:42.669 --> 26:44.637
You two dig deeper
into Cranston.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.706
If he's taking orders
from a dirty cop...

26:46.739 --> 26:48.207
Something in his past
will point to who.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.710
And we need to identify who
before Sonja and Isler

26:50.743 --> 26:51.878
get in too deep.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.012
All right.
Go.

26:54.747 --> 26:56.315
SONJA: Look, we've been driving
for over an hour.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.317
How long are you gonna keep us
in the dark?

26:58.350 --> 27:00.052
When I know where to stop,
you will, too.

27:00.086 --> 27:01.954
Is this some kind of scam
you're pulling here?
Hey.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.355
Relax, big guy.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.391
Charlie never lets me down.

27:05.424 --> 27:07.393
CHARLIE:
Good afternoon.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.195
You've almost arrived
at your destination.

27:09.228 --> 27:12.865
Welcome to Gulfport.
Please continue down this road.

27:12.899 --> 27:14.834
Like I said.

27:14.867 --> 27:17.804
Target ETA is ten minutes out.

27:17.837 --> 27:20.039
And what exactly is this target?
Quiet.

27:20.072 --> 27:22.775
Charlie talks, we listen;
not the other way around.

27:25.878 --> 27:28.180
*

27:35.121 --> 27:37.857
GREGORIO: This thing's
about to go down, Pride.

27:37.890 --> 27:38.725
Are we gonna let it?

27:38.758 --> 27:40.326
PRIDE:
Moment they pull the truck over,

27:40.359 --> 27:41.828
we've got them dead to rights.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.195
LASALLE: They're armed
to the teeth, though.

27:43.229 --> 27:44.396
If we don't play this tight,

27:44.430 --> 27:46.398
things could go sideways fast.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.841
CHARLIE:
Get ready.

27:54.874 --> 27:57.476
The target is closing in.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.812
Three, two, one.

28:14.226 --> 28:17.897
Hey! You move, I shoot!
Understand?

28:21.167 --> 28:22.368
Hurry up.
Get in there.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.808
Here.

28:28.841 --> 28:29.942
Come on.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.312
Come on. Hurry up.

28:34.947 --> 28:35.681
That's what we need. Let's go!

28:35.714 --> 28:37.850
MAN: You ain't
goin' anywhere!

28:37.884 --> 28:39.385
Drop your weapons now!

28:41.420 --> 28:42.755
I said drop 'em!

28:43.489 --> 28:45.391
So much for playing it tight.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.159
Do it now or I'll smoke you.

28:54.801 --> 28:56.769
NCIS!

28:56.803 --> 28:57.804
Look out!

29:02.341 --> 29:03.843
Gregorio!

29:03.876 --> 29:04.543
Get in the car!

29:04.576 --> 29:07.013
Get in the frickin'
car now!

29:07.046 --> 29:08.915
Gregorio! Are you with me?

29:14.954 --> 29:17.924
CHARLIE: Call went out.
60 seconds till the 12 arrive.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.826
Drive.
What about Hicks?

29:19.859 --> 29:21.427
Just drive!

29:26.032 --> 29:27.834
Gregorio, you all right?

29:27.867 --> 29:29.268
I'm fine, I'm fine.
The vest took the slug.

29:29.301 --> 29:30.469
It hurts, though.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.504
What about the Charger?
Percy and Isler

29:32.538 --> 29:33.806
took off with Cranston.

29:33.840 --> 29:34.907
They're gone.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.519
Tammy was shot?
In the vest.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.856
Cracked a couple ribs.
She's tough.

29:49.889 --> 29:52.024
Well, we got to pull Percy
and Isler out of there now.

29:52.058 --> 29:53.592
We got to find them first,
Sebastian.

29:53.625 --> 29:54.894
We got no communication.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.262
:
Right, right. And with...

29:56.295 --> 29:58.330
Charlie helping
Cranston avoid the police,

29:58.364 --> 30:00.566
it's gonna be even harder
to track them down.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.134
So we track Charlie instead.

30:02.168 --> 30:04.203
I've been digging
in Cranston's background.

30:04.236 --> 30:06.372
I've been looking for any
connection to any cops.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.107
SEBASTIAN:
That's a pretty big pool.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.575
Plenty have arrested him,

30:09.608 --> 30:11.510
questioned him,
testified against him.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.179
Plus, Cranston
moves around a lot,

30:13.212 --> 30:15.281
so there's a dozen
different jurisdictions up here.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.049
So we need to
narrow it down.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.885
Lasalle and Gregorio's
surveillance mic

30:18.918 --> 30:22.855
recorded Charlie's voice just
before the Charger got away.

30:22.889 --> 30:25.491
Charlie said "the 12"
were 60 seconds out.

30:25.524 --> 30:28.527
That's slang for law enforcement
in the Atlanta area.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.862
All right,
so then we focus on Atlanta.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.130
PRIDE:
Yeah.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.932
PATTON:
Hey, I got something here.

30:32.965 --> 30:36.002
FBI Special Agent
Roger Driscoll.

30:36.035 --> 30:37.303
SEBASTIAN: Driscoll.
Here he is.

30:37.336 --> 30:40.506
Former agent,
actually retired in 2015.

30:40.539 --> 30:43.109
Before that, he was head
of the resident agency in Macon.

30:43.142 --> 30:44.476
Arrested Cranston

30:44.510 --> 30:46.612
for weapons possession
a decade ago.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.447
And then Cranston became
Driscoll's C.I.,

30:48.480 --> 30:51.417
and they went after stickup
teams across Georgia for years.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.585
Yeah, means they had
a close relationship.
Not only that,

30:53.619 --> 30:56.122
but Driscoll owns a property
right outside of Lakeview.

30:56.155 --> 30:58.925
All right,
we need to get there fast.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.160
Sebastian, you're with me.

31:01.193 --> 31:04.931
No idea if Cranston made
Sonja and Isler.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.934
But if he did,
they're in trouble.

31:07.967 --> 31:11.437
Patton, keep Lasalle
and Gregorio in the loop.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.606
CHARLIE: Time for another
detour, Cranston.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.575
We need to get you
off this main road.

31:16.608 --> 31:19.345
Take the next left
and pull behind the barbershop.

31:19.378 --> 31:20.612
You'll need cover.

31:20.646 --> 31:23.015
State police are approaching
from the opposite direction.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.326
How you doing back there?

31:34.360 --> 31:35.962
Fine.
ISLER: You're
bleeding out.

31:35.995 --> 31:36.996
You need a hospital.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.697
What I need is an explanation.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.166
What's NCIS?

31:40.199 --> 31:41.267
And why'd you warn them

31:41.300 --> 31:42.935
about Hicks?

31:42.969 --> 31:45.071
I wasn't warning them,
I was warning Hicks. Wait.

31:45.104 --> 31:48.174
You still think I'm a cop?
Cops would want to get me
to a hospital.

31:48.207 --> 31:49.942
Crooks would let me die.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.978
You two,
on the other hand...

31:53.745 --> 31:55.447
...still a question mark.

31:55.481 --> 31:56.648
CHARLIE:
You're clear.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.117
Keep heading north.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.952
Do what the man says.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.410
Clear.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.512
SEBASTIAN:
Pride, I need you out back.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.985
CHARLIE:
Keep your speed under 65

32:33.019 --> 32:35.321
to avoid unnecessary detection.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.189
Continue down the frontage road.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.660
Federal agents!

32:43.062 --> 32:45.031
Then once you cross
the train tracks,

32:45.064 --> 32:47.033
you're in the clear
for the next ten miles.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.401
Well, this is where Driscoll's
running the heists from.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.203
Yeah, but he's not here.

32:51.237 --> 32:52.771
But his equipment is. Satellite
tracking, communications.

32:52.804 --> 32:56.408
It's all online right now. He's
probably logged in remotely.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.510
Does that mean you can crack
his system and find him?

32:58.544 --> 32:59.545
Yeah, with Patton's help, I can.

32:59.578 --> 33:00.546
Well, get to it.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.481
CHARLIE:
In 500 yards,

33:02.514 --> 33:04.150
you'll turn off
the frontage road.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.418
Keep driving
until you see the tires.

33:06.452 --> 33:09.088
Then pull over.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.394
Okay, Cranston, we're here.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.663
And, look, we gonna have to have
a little conversation

33:17.696 --> 33:19.065
about workplace etiquette.

33:19.098 --> 33:21.367
Cranston,

33:21.400 --> 33:22.768
you hear me?

33:26.572 --> 33:27.606
He's dead.

33:29.141 --> 33:30.109
Well, isn't that great?

33:30.142 --> 33:31.510
Why couldn't he have done that
30 miles back

33:31.543 --> 33:32.711
when we knew
where the hell we were?

33:32.744 --> 33:34.713
Situation has much improved.

33:34.746 --> 33:37.549
We're armed, and we're about
to take down Charlie.

33:37.583 --> 33:40.452
No, we about to back up out
of these spooky-ass woods

33:40.486 --> 33:42.321
and find us some help.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.123
Sonja, we're too close.
We can't turn around.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.458
We have no way
of contacting NCIS,

33:46.492 --> 33:49.761
which means we have no backup
and no idea how many men

33:49.795 --> 33:50.829
Charlie's coming with.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.764
I'll call Pride on this.

33:52.798 --> 33:55.201
Do it on the drive.

33:55.234 --> 33:56.802
CHARLIE:
Welcome back.

33:56.835 --> 33:58.304
After all the trouble
in Gulfport,

33:58.337 --> 34:00.139
I'm sure
you're ready to be done.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.341
Bring me the merchandise,
Cranston.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.576
Now what?

34:05.644 --> 34:07.446
I'm gonna make the trade.

34:07.479 --> 34:10.149
You gonna what?
Cover me.

34:10.182 --> 34:12.184
The minute he's back in the car,
shoot out the tires.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.390
I got this.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.659
You got to stop saying that.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.199
Cranston's dead!

34:27.233 --> 34:30.102
But I have the take!

34:31.137 --> 34:32.738
Bring it here.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.340
But move slowly.

34:34.373 --> 34:37.243
Driver, back
in the vehicle!

34:41.847 --> 34:44.450
Bad news
about Cranston.

34:44.483 --> 34:45.784
How'd it happen?

34:45.817 --> 34:47.286
Cops shot him.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.388
DRISCOLL:
Live by the sword, right?

34:49.421 --> 34:52.224
Anyway,
deal's a deal.

34:52.258 --> 34:54.226
Drop the bags.

34:55.894 --> 34:57.763
Payment for services rendered.

34:58.797 --> 35:01.333
Wait a minute.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.202
Raymond Isler?

35:03.235 --> 35:04.703
Driscoll?

35:05.771 --> 35:07.273
Small world.

35:07.306 --> 35:08.540
Hands up.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.595
What's going on here, Driscoll?

35:29.628 --> 35:31.297
You tell me, Raymond.

35:31.330 --> 35:32.464
You're gonna lower the weapon,

35:32.498 --> 35:34.500
now!
Misjudging the situation here.

35:34.533 --> 35:37.536
I've got the leverage
right now.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.571
I guess I should
be flattered, Raymond.

35:39.605 --> 35:41.707
My little side gig
got you out in the field.

35:41.740 --> 35:42.874
You know this guy?

35:42.908 --> 35:44.443
We used to work together.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.778
Years ago.
They sent him
to the Macon office

35:46.812 --> 35:48.714
after his nasty little
drug addiction.

35:50.316 --> 35:51.583
But it wasn't
for long, was it?

35:51.617 --> 35:54.420
He got the corner office
soon enough.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.555
But me, I have
a perfect record.

35:56.588 --> 35:58.290
I got the boondocks
for 30 years

35:58.324 --> 36:00.426
and a bad buffet lunch
to say good-bye.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.494
And now you're running heists.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.563
Spent a career trying
to get somebody in D.C.

36:04.596 --> 36:06.398
to pay attention
to this opioid crisis.

36:06.432 --> 36:07.433
No one listened.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.768
So you decided
to get yours, huh?

36:09.801 --> 36:11.970
Tell your girl
to toss the weapon.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.440
You're caught here, Driscoll.

36:14.473 --> 36:16.542
We called in the
moment we got here.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.910
Backup's minutes away.
Communications are down.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.912
There's not a cop
within ten miles of this place.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.448
You want to live,

36:22.481 --> 36:23.615
you'll follow
my instructions.

36:23.649 --> 36:24.750
Not gonna happen.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.652
See, Percy here

36:26.685 --> 36:28.587
is NCIS.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.522
Expert sharpshooter.

36:30.556 --> 36:33.559
She can take you out
at 1,800 meters.

36:35.261 --> 36:36.995
You're as good as dead,
Driscoll.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.565
Well, I guess we'll find out.

36:44.703 --> 36:45.837
PRIDE:
Hang on!

36:59.918 --> 37:01.587
Isler, you okay?

37:01.620 --> 37:02.588
ISLER:
Yeah.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.761
It's not the best time,
but you should

37:09.795 --> 37:11.597
probably know that I get
intense motion sickness

37:11.630 --> 37:13.565
when driving at high speeds
over uneven roads.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.233
Not now, Sebastian.
Yeah.

37:18.337 --> 37:21.340
If Driscoll makes the main road,
he's gonna outrun us.

37:51.703 --> 37:53.672
He's gone.

37:53.705 --> 37:56.041
All right, I need
to take a seat real quick.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.709
That was a little too fast
and furious for me.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.282
PRIDE:
Oh.

38:09.721 --> 38:11.723
*

38:22.434 --> 38:23.902
Hail the conquering hero!
SONJA: Ooh!

38:23.935 --> 38:26.338
You're alive!
Whoa!

38:26.372 --> 38:28.006
No hugging for
four to six weeks.
Okay. Here.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.975
Thank you.
Are you gonna be
all right?

38:30.008 --> 38:31.076
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just, you know,

38:31.109 --> 38:32.210
my rib's a
little sensitive.

38:32.243 --> 38:34.746
Eh, that's not what you were
saying on the way over here.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.715
Complaining and
whining the whole way.

38:36.748 --> 38:39.451
That's because you hit
every pothole in New Orleans.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.421
Come on, take a seat, Tammy.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.822
No, sitting's hard.
I'll just stand.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.391
That's...

38:45.424 --> 38:47.593
I'll lean, actually.
Le-Leaning's good.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.761
I tried taking her home, but...
But I had to see

38:49.795 --> 38:51.897
for myself that you and Raymond
actually pulled this off.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.365
I know.
I mean...

38:53.399 --> 38:54.600
Yes, Gregorio.

38:54.633 --> 38:57.035
Somehow, we managed
to stop the bad guys.

38:57.068 --> 38:59.471
So you're back in the suit?
I was feeling the leather.

38:59.505 --> 39:02.941
Uh, no, no. The-the
leather's retired.

39:02.974 --> 39:06.678
I have...
I've got a late flight to D.C.

39:06.712 --> 39:07.879
The bosses want to
discuss my future.

39:07.913 --> 39:11.082
Oh, off the bench and back in
the game. Congrats, Isler.

39:11.116 --> 39:13.018
Yeah, don't forget about us
when you're all, you know,

39:13.051 --> 39:14.052
big and important again.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.588
Actually, on second thought,
do forget about us...

39:16.622 --> 39:18.424
Ah.
...because when you're here,
man, it's-it's complicated.

39:18.457 --> 39:22.628
Well, you know, I don't know
if I can make that promise.

39:22.661 --> 39:25.431
Why don't you guys try
staying out of trouble?

39:25.464 --> 39:28.434
Eh, I don't know if, uh,
we can make that promise.

39:29.801 --> 39:30.936
Yeah.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.971
Hey.

39:34.440 --> 39:37.543
Um, I had a lot of doubts

39:37.576 --> 39:39.478
about you, but...

39:39.511 --> 39:41.146
you did good out there today.

39:41.179 --> 39:42.714
Thanks, Percy.
Yeah,

39:42.748 --> 39:44.583
you exceeded my...

39:44.616 --> 39:45.784
Well, they were low

39:45.817 --> 39:48.787
expectations, but still.
Yes.

39:48.820 --> 39:53.425
Well, I always thought your
greatest skill set was snark.

39:53.459 --> 39:55.727
Thanks.
You're welcome.

39:55.761 --> 39:58.564
But after what I witnessed
today,

39:58.597 --> 40:01.833
you're as versatile
a field agent as I've ever met.

40:03.702 --> 40:06.004
This town ever gets too small
for you, call me.

40:06.037 --> 40:09.875
FBI can always use
talent like yours.

40:15.146 --> 40:17.983
*

40:22.821 --> 40:26.625
* Tie my head to the block
and chop *

40:26.658 --> 40:29.861
* Shoot me dead
when I tell you to stop *

40:29.895 --> 40:33.131
* Fake an exit
that's all too grand *

40:33.164 --> 40:35.601
* Just to haunt me...

40:35.634 --> 40:37.536
I heard D.C. called for you.

40:37.569 --> 40:38.904
Figured you'd be
on the first flight out.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.706
Yeah, couldn't leave
without saying good-bye.

40:40.739 --> 40:44.643
Yeah, well, can't let
you leave without, uh...

40:44.676 --> 40:46.177
without a toast.

40:46.211 --> 40:47.713
Hey.

40:47.746 --> 40:49.781
Listen...
Lemon or lime?

40:50.816 --> 40:52.217
Lime.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.952
For my club soda.

40:54.986 --> 40:57.122
Percy,

40:57.155 --> 40:59.224
she told you about my past?

40:59.257 --> 41:02.060
No, no. I had a feeling.

41:02.093 --> 41:05.096
You took this case...
personally.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.966
Plus, I've never seen you
have a drink.

41:07.999 --> 41:11.537
It's been 15 years.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.038
Good for you.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.206
You know, I couldn't have done
any of this without you.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.808
I owe you one.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.176
You owe me nothing.
We're friends.

41:19.645 --> 41:22.614
To you and
your team and...

41:22.648 --> 41:24.716
And to New Orleans! Ha!

41:24.750 --> 41:27.719
Okay, fine. Just this once.

41:27.753 --> 41:30.121
Mmm.

41:30.155 --> 41:31.590
* Ticktock, the clock is...

41:31.623 --> 41:32.991
Listen,

41:33.024 --> 41:34.693
when I get back to Washington,

41:34.726 --> 41:36.528
I'll keep an eye out.

41:36.562 --> 41:39.130
I'll warn you if there's
any problems headed your way.

41:39.164 --> 41:42.133
Raymond, I've been good
with the suits for months.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.035
Toeing the line.

41:44.069 --> 41:46.237
No more beefs with the bosses.

41:46.271 --> 41:47.673
This isn't about the bosses.

41:47.706 --> 41:49.207
This is about your enemies.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.242
I told you before, someone
has their sights on you.

41:51.276 --> 41:53.545
Someone with real power
who wants you gone

41:53.579 --> 41:54.680
no matter what
line you toe.

41:54.713 --> 41:56.014
Do you understand?
I appreciate that.

41:57.115 --> 41:58.684
But I won't be afraid
of the unknown.

41:58.717 --> 41:59.951
Can't live like that.

42:01.086 --> 42:03.088
If you get something
substantial, let me know.

42:05.090 --> 42:07.693
If I learn anything,

42:07.726 --> 42:09.595
I'll be in touch.

42:09.628 --> 42:11.597
Raymond, hey, hey.
Yeah.

42:11.630 --> 42:14.265
Be in touch regardless.

42:14.299 --> 42:18.704
* Gasoline you set on fire

42:18.737 --> 42:21.773
* You light the pyre that sets
my soul to flames, I want to *

42:21.807 --> 42:25.944
* Feed you to the wolves,
but I know *

42:25.977 --> 42:28.614
* You'll just haunt me.

42:28.647 --> 42:31.082
