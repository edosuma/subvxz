00:00.600 --> 00:01.900
<i>Previously on "The Whispers"...</i>

00:02.000 --> 00:04.800
Sean was not a perfect husband.
I was not a perfect wife.

00:05.300 --> 00:06.600
Why did you do it, Claire?

00:07.135 --> 00:09.436
We found Sean's plane
thousands of miles away

00:09.471 --> 00:10.721
from where he was supposed to
have disappeared.

00:10.772 --> 00:13.057
I have nothing. No memories...

00:13.108 --> 00:14.475
There is one thing I can tell you.

00:14.477 --> 00:16.560
Whoever's doing this, this isn't over.

00:16.611 --> 00:18.479
Wes: That is what the
children call "Drill."

00:18.481 --> 00:20.481
It appears to be some form of energy.

00:20.483 --> 00:22.149
He uses kids, but not just any kids.

00:22.183 --> 00:24.618
They all have access or information.

00:24.653 --> 00:26.787
Wes: I found something in the
desert, something incredible.

00:26.821 --> 00:29.490
Drill wanted it here for a reason.

00:29.524 --> 00:31.492
Sean: Something is calling.

00:31.494 --> 00:33.327
[Electricity crackles]

00:33.378 --> 00:35.129
[Gasping]

00:35.163 --> 00:37.164
[Breathing shakily] I remember.

00:37.215 --> 00:38.298
I remember everything.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.602
- [Jet engine roars]
- Sean: 937, 937!

00:41.636 --> 00:44.505
I am off flight plan.
Repeat... I am off flight plan.

00:44.556 --> 00:47.474
I'm losing oxygen! 937!

00:47.509 --> 00:49.343
Does anyone hear me?

00:49.345 --> 00:50.477
I'm losing altitude. Do you copy?

00:50.512 --> 00:52.429
[Beeping]

00:52.480 --> 00:54.932
937! I'm punching out!

00:54.983 --> 00:57.234
Eject, eject, eject!

- [Whispering]

01:11.199 --> 01:12.332
Claire?

01:12.367 --> 01:15.335
President Winters: Then what
happened, captain?

01:20.208 --> 01:21.842
I woke up in the desert,

01:21.876 --> 01:25.679
no memory of who I was, where, or why.

01:25.713 --> 01:27.714
The only clear thought I had

01:27.765 --> 01:30.884
was that I was somehow
connected to this thing.

01:30.935 --> 01:32.552
Connected?

01:32.603 --> 01:34.388
Until last night...

01:34.439 --> 01:37.758
When I touched that rock.

01:37.775 --> 01:39.359
Then it was gone.

01:39.394 --> 01:42.979
I'd like to know how the hell
an F-22 gets from the Arctic

01:43.030 --> 01:44.481
to the Sahara in the blink of an eye.

01:44.532 --> 01:46.650
We have 12 satellites
that pass through the arctic...

01:46.701 --> 01:48.235
we've seen the evidence.

01:48.237 --> 01:51.238
Some of you have seen it
with your own eyes.

01:51.272 --> 01:54.274
Are we all just afraid to say

01:54.308 --> 01:56.042
what we actually think it is?

01:56.077 --> 01:59.879
Mr. President, I believe
we are facing something

01:59.914 --> 02:02.349
that can only be classified as alien, sir.

02:02.383 --> 02:07.087
Classify it as you like,
but this is what I know...

02:07.089 --> 02:10.757
without a doubt,
it will do whatever it takes

02:10.758 --> 02:12.425
to get what it wants.

02:12.427 --> 02:13.927
What <i> does</i> it want?

02:13.978 --> 02:15.662
To destroy us, sir.

02:17.264 --> 02:19.432
Haley, you've said that you believe

02:19.483 --> 02:22.736
that it might be trying to reach this rock

02:22.770 --> 02:24.904
that was found
near the captain's crash site.

02:24.939 --> 02:28.525
If that's true,
what are we doing to secure it?

02:28.576 --> 02:31.361
We have several contingency plans in place.

02:31.412 --> 02:33.113
But I think Wes Lawrence's team

02:33.115 --> 02:34.948
has the best defensive posture.

02:34.999 --> 02:39.953
Mr. President, here's what
we know about the entity...

02:40.004 --> 02:41.955
number one, it appears

02:42.006 --> 02:44.457
to only directly communicate with children.

02:44.508 --> 02:47.927
Now, whether that's a choice
or a necessity,

02:47.962 --> 02:50.513
we don't yet know.

02:53.467 --> 02:55.134
Number two, we believe

02:55.136 --> 02:57.804
that it can only be in one place at a time.

02:57.806 --> 03:02.308
Number three, when it travels,
it travels electrically

03:02.310 --> 03:06.145
through lights, power cables, et cetera.

03:06.147 --> 03:08.147
- [Electricity crackling]
- [Clicking]

03:08.198 --> 03:11.317
[Whispering]

03:11.368 --> 03:13.236
Can I play a game on your phone, mommy?

03:13.287 --> 03:15.738
Sure.

03:15.789 --> 03:17.457
[Sighs] Just the one, okay?

03:17.491 --> 03:20.293
Wes: And four, when present,

03:20.327 --> 03:25.364
it can be identified by a heat signature.

03:25.399 --> 03:26.532
And so, for your security,

03:26.567 --> 03:29.202
we have installed
thermal cameras to confirm

03:29.236 --> 03:32.538
that while we're clearly
not alone in the universe,

03:32.573 --> 03:34.140
we are in this room.

03:34.174 --> 03:38.978
Now, as for the rock, we are
still trying to determine

03:39.012 --> 03:42.348
the precise importance of it
to the entity, and until we do,

03:42.399 --> 03:44.884
we will surround it with magnetic towers.

03:44.918 --> 03:48.521
These will create an energy dead zone.

03:48.572 --> 03:51.057
We have planned for this, Mr. President.

03:52.743 --> 03:54.277
Planned for?

03:54.328 --> 03:58.281
You've been involved with this
thing for, what, a few days?

03:58.332 --> 04:01.834
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

04:01.868 --> 04:04.670
Mr. President, I lived with this thing...

04:04.705 --> 04:07.006
in my head for three months.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.342
It is intelligent, it is manipulative,

04:09.376 --> 04:12.461
and if you truly want to protect
the people of this country,

04:12.512 --> 04:14.797
you will blow that rock to kingdom come.

04:14.848 --> 04:17.466
With all due respect, captain
bennigan has been through a lot,

04:17.517 --> 04:20.519
but we should not allow ourselves
to be governed by fear.

04:20.553 --> 04:22.638
Now, if this thing wants the rock,

04:22.689 --> 04:25.691
well, that gives us leverage...
a bargaining chip.

04:25.725 --> 04:27.142
But until we use that bargaining chip,

04:27.194 --> 04:29.812
we study it, we learn from it,

04:29.863 --> 04:31.497
and who knows what it could teach us?

04:31.531 --> 04:34.366
Now, Mr. President, you have heard opinion,

04:34.401 --> 04:36.402
you have heard conjecture.

04:36.453 --> 04:38.571
But seeing is believing.

04:38.622 --> 04:40.072
I... I think it's time that you...

04:40.074 --> 04:42.408
I... I don't know that that's the
most prudent course of action.

04:42.410 --> 04:45.411
No, Mr. Lawrence is right.

04:45.413 --> 04:48.414
Decisions shouldn't be made
sitting behind a desk.

04:50.917 --> 04:52.551
Take me to it.

04:55.555 --> 04:57.339
Welcome home, ma'am.

04:57.390 --> 04:58.674
Thank you.

05:37.013 --> 05:38.630
When am I going to be released, sir?

05:38.681 --> 05:40.566
You think you're going home, captain?

05:40.600 --> 05:41.933
I'm no longer a threat.

05:41.968 --> 05:43.969
I'm not connected to that rock anymore.

05:43.971 --> 05:48.557
That may be true, but...
We have other considerations.

05:48.608 --> 05:51.059
What considerations, sir?

05:51.110 --> 05:54.913
We need to find out exactly
what we're facing here.

05:54.947 --> 05:56.946
It seems you're the closest
thing to an expert we've got.

05:56.949 --> 05:59.067
I told you everything I know.

05:59.118 --> 06:00.786
We believe there may be
physiological aspects

06:00.820 --> 06:02.404
within your nervous system

06:02.455 --> 06:05.574
that allowed the enemy
to communicate with you.

06:05.625 --> 06:09.244
You've interacted with the rock
on two separate occasions.

06:09.295 --> 06:11.162
Sir, if you think
there's going to be a third...

06:11.164 --> 06:12.914
You're a United States
military officer, son.

06:12.965 --> 06:17.002
You're supposed to run
at the enemy, not away from him.

06:17.004 --> 06:20.038
When was the last time
<i>you</i> ran at the enemy, sir?

06:21.641 --> 06:27.095
Just so we're... we're clear on this...

06:27.146 --> 06:29.931
I have everything I need
to convince a court

06:29.982 --> 06:32.017
that you're a danger
to your country, captain.

06:32.068 --> 06:37.523
So, the way I see it,
you can do as you're ordered,

06:38.574 --> 06:40.659
report to the black site,

06:40.693 --> 06:43.495
help us learn everything we can

06:43.529 --> 06:46.498
about this thing we're up against...

06:46.532 --> 06:48.533
Or you can go to prison.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.628
- Mr. President.
- Mr. Lawrence.

07:00.679 --> 07:06.017
As I rode here, thinking
on this... Situation,

07:06.051 --> 07:09.888
I have never felt more acutely
the duty of the constitution,

07:09.890 --> 07:14.225
that which I swore to defend.

07:14.227 --> 07:18.229
Do you know the passage from the preamble?

07:18.231 --> 07:20.565
"We the people..."

07:20.567 --> 07:24.902
In order to secure the blessings of liberty

07:24.904 --> 07:28.606
"to ourselves and our posterity..."

07:28.640 --> 07:33.611
That's our descendants,
Mr. Lawrence... our children.

07:35.381 --> 07:38.783
And that's on me now.

07:38.817 --> 07:41.953
If I may, sir, you're not alone.

07:44.056 --> 07:47.508
It's <i> "we</i> the people."

07:47.559 --> 07:53.358
And we are right here... With you... Ready.

08:02.507 --> 08:04.809
Protect this rock.

08:04.843 --> 08:07.778
That's my decision.

08:23.976 --> 08:25.360
I don't know.

08:25.394 --> 08:28.113
They hauled him away last night
before I could even talk to him.

08:31.651 --> 08:34.953
He said...

08:34.986 --> 08:37.455
He said he remembers.

08:40.493 --> 08:42.626
Everything.

08:45.998 --> 08:47.982
Thanks.

08:48.017 --> 08:49.818

This one is for the best hitter
in the playoffs.

09:40.184 --> 09:42.685
I'm so proud of you, little man.

09:42.687 --> 09:45.020
And here's the airplane you left me.

09:45.022 --> 09:47.356
I play with it all the time.

09:47.407 --> 09:49.024
Come on.

09:51.862 --> 09:55.614
And that's when mom took me
to see the Orioles.

09:55.665 --> 09:58.834
It was awesome.

10:02.372 --> 10:05.107
Dad, do you want to go out back
and play catch?

10:13.300 --> 10:16.185
Claire: I thought you...

10:16.219 --> 10:18.687
We didn't think you were coming back.

10:28.948 --> 10:32.117
Look at that. [Grunts]

torn the residence apart by now

12:09.198 --> 12:10.832
Looks like I missed dinner.

12:10.834 --> 12:14.335
Drill said not to tell daddy
about the game.

12:14.337 --> 12:16.671
It has to be our secret.

12:16.673 --> 12:18.673
[Lid closes]

12:18.675 --> 12:21.342
That's okay, honey.
We're just glad you're home.

12:21.344 --> 12:22.777
[Smooches]

12:24.396 --> 12:25.947
Um, I'll heat something up.

12:25.981 --> 12:27.682
You go play with your daughter.

12:27.716 --> 12:28.850
Okay.

12:28.852 --> 12:33.851
So... What are we playing?

12:44.950 --> 12:48.870
He refused to go to sleep.

12:48.921 --> 12:50.905
"One more story, daddy, one more."

12:55.075 --> 12:57.810
He could hear me.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.081
[Chuckles] It was amazing.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.015
He can barely believe that you're back.

13:07.615 --> 13:09.082
Me, neither.

13:11.486 --> 13:12.953
Sean, we need...

13:12.987 --> 13:13.987
I'm tired.

13:14.038 --> 13:15.038
Claire...

13:15.936 --> 13:17.615
I haven't slept...

13:19.123 --> 13:21.815
Truly slept... in months.

13:26.301 --> 13:30.087
Yeah. Of course. [Breathes deeply]

13:32.006 --> 13:34.307
I wasn't sure if...

13:35.843 --> 13:37.844
I wasn't sure if you were sleeping...

13:40.181 --> 13:43.150
upstairs or if you...

13:43.184 --> 13:45.819
[Sighs]

13:45.853 --> 13:47.421
Are you sleeping upstairs?

[Cellphone vibrating]

13:55.863 --> 13:57.697
Wes, I can't really talk right now.

13:57.699 --> 13:59.366
I know.

13:59.368 --> 14:03.036
I just... I just wanted to check in on you.

14:03.038 --> 14:04.371
[Door creaks]

14:04.405 --> 14:08.675
I'm fine. I am.

14:08.709 --> 14:11.044

14:11.095 --> 14:14.297
Where else would he go? This is his home.

14:24.525 --> 14:25.892
Did you two talk?

14:25.926 --> 14:29.562
Uh, no. He was tired.

14:29.597 --> 14:31.231
[Sighs]

14:31.233 --> 14:34.734
And I'm not... I'm not really sure

14:34.769 --> 14:36.703
how this is supposed to work, Wes.

14:36.737 --> 14:37.904
Which part?

14:37.938 --> 14:39.706
All of it.

14:39.740 --> 14:40.907
Well, I...

14:40.958 --> 14:44.577
I think we just try
and figure it out day by day.

14:44.628 --> 14:47.413
- [Sighs]
- Listen, Claire...

14:47.415 --> 14:49.449
I... I just want you
to be careful around Sean.

14:49.483 --> 14:50.416
Wes...

14:50.467 --> 14:52.168
- Okay? I... I just...
- Wes.

14:52.219 --> 14:54.587
We don't really know... we don't
really know what he's been through,

14:54.638 --> 14:59.792
what it did to him,
what he's done, what he'll do.

14:59.827 --> 15:03.596
He's gonna be fine.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.265
We're...

15:05.267 --> 15:08.501
[Sighs] Gonna be fine.

15:10.537 --> 15:13.172
Just be careful, Claire.

[Clicking]

15:53.880 --> 15:56.380
Cassandra, you left this in daddy's car.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.780
Oh, thank you, mommy.

15:57.814 --> 15:59.949
Mm-hmm. [Chuckles]

15:59.983 --> 16:02.118
Now, I couldn't find my phone.

16:02.152 --> 16:05.788
Uh, are you sure you put it in my purse?

16:05.822 --> 16:08.624
I think so.

16:08.658 --> 16:10.960
We'll check the residence tonight, ma'am.

16:10.994 --> 16:12.461
- Thank you.
- Goodnight.

16:12.496 --> 16:13.963
Goodnight, Cassandra.

16:13.997 --> 16:17.466
- Mm.

16:56.666 --> 16:58.617
Dad!

17:01.265 --> 17:05.050
Dad, where are you?

17:05.102 --> 17:07.053
Sean: In the kitchen.

17:11.065 --> 17:12.065
What happened?

17:12.365 --> 17:15.065
You know, I couldn't find
where grammy left the griddle.

17:15.765 --> 17:18.468
Um, we haven't used it since...

17:19.865 --> 17:20.965
Since you were gone.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.992
- [Sizzling]
- Yeah, I know.

17:24.044 --> 17:27.329
But I made blueberry... your favorite.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.835
Aren't you having some?

17:32.886 --> 17:35.087
No, I'm gonna leave the rest
for you and your mom.

17:35.121 --> 17:39.424
But... I will sit with you.

17:52.822 --> 17:57.442
Henry, I want to talk to you
about something.

17:57.493 --> 18:00.112
You remember what daddy's job is, right?

18:00.163 --> 18:01.697
I protect people.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.199
People like you and mommy,

18:04.250 --> 18:06.168
other families around the country.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.791
Well, I have a new mission...

18:12.842 --> 18:18.171
A very important mission...
and I need your help.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.934
I need you to look out
for your mom while I'm gone.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.554
But you just got home.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.440
How can you leave again?

18:28.474 --> 18:30.442
I know, son.

18:32.812 --> 18:37.783
I need you to know
that I want to be here with you.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.117
Promise you're gonna come back.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.285
Henry...

18:40.319 --> 18:41.736
Promise!

18:43.956 --> 18:46.258
I promise.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.629
I don't believe you.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.587
Claire: You can't do this to him.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.589
You can't do this to Henry, Sean.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.258
Hey. Hey, stop.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.428
Hey, look at me. What is this about?

19:06.479 --> 19:07.479
- Is this ab...
- Wes Lawrence?

19:07.513 --> 19:09.848
Y... You think I care about Wes Lawrence?

19:09.899 --> 19:13.184
Then what <i>do</i> you care about?

19:13.235 --> 19:14.519
It sure as hell doesn't feel like it's us.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.521
Pentagon gave me two choices...

19:16.572 --> 19:19.774
Go to prison or become their guinea pig.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.443
- How are you even...
- Here?

19:21.494 --> 19:25.113
I told them I needed one night at home

19:25.164 --> 19:27.365
before I made a decision.
I don't understand.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.117
Which did you choose?

19:29.168 --> 19:31.085
The only one that protects our son.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.707
Sean.

19:35.758 --> 19:38.042
Sean.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.515
What are you going to do?

19:43.549 --> 19:45.583
What are we supposed to do,
lock our daughter in her room

19:45.618 --> 19:47.218
- and throw away the key?
- Of course not.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.554
I'm just saying maybe I should watch
what I say about work in case she's...

19:49.605 --> 19:51.055
In case what?

19:51.057 --> 19:52.223
In case she's still talking to Drill.

19:52.225 --> 19:55.059
Uh... Minx isn't dangerous, Wes.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.312
But her friend is.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.197
[Sighs]

19:59.231 --> 20:01.866
Look, you just need to trust me, okay?

20:01.900 --> 20:04.535
The less she knows, the safer she'll be.

20:04.570 --> 20:07.705
You think that's how to keep
us safe... keep us in the dark?

20:07.740 --> 20:11.542
We've discovered something, Lena.

20:11.577 --> 20:14.712
And believe me when I say
we are making progress.

20:14.746 --> 20:15.913
"Progress"?

20:15.915 --> 20:17.915
[Scoffing] That's all you're gonna tell me?

20:17.917 --> 20:19.383
I... I... I can't.

20:19.418 --> 20:21.002
[Sighs]

20:21.053 --> 20:22.670
Okay? We just need...

20:22.721 --> 20:25.006
You just to trust me a little while longer.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.090
Okay?

20:28.393 --> 20:31.345
You take care of everyone else.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.015
I can take care of our daughter.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.767
Sean: What do you hope to learn from me?

20:36.802 --> 20:38.769
I have spent my whole life posing questions

20:38.804 --> 20:40.938
about the universe, Captain Bennigan...

20:40.973 --> 20:43.941
about the possibility
of a higher intelligence

20:43.976 --> 20:45.943
somewhere out there.

20:45.978 --> 20:49.447
Because of you, I finally
get a chance to answer them.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.782
- A higher intelligence?
- [Beep]

20:51.784 --> 20:54.285
What little we've learned
about this rock so far,

20:54.319 --> 20:56.954
one thing is clear...
The being that created it...

20:56.956 --> 21:01.959
Compared to ants,<i> we</i> are
a higher intelligence, doctor.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.795
And I'm guessing we must have
seemed pretty intriguing to them

21:04.846 --> 21:06.430
until we invented bug spray.

21:06.465 --> 21:08.299
You really think you're the only one

21:08.350 --> 21:10.468
getting answers from this encounter?

21:10.519 --> 21:13.137
This visitor, he's getting them, too.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.221
About us.

21:14.272 --> 21:15.806
And just when he's learned

21:15.808 --> 21:19.143
precisely what it's gonna take
to destroy us,

21:19.145 --> 21:21.645
he's gonna use that "higher intelligence"

21:21.647 --> 21:24.982
to do exactly that.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.952
Unless you help me stop him.

21:34.958 --> 21:37.477
- [Knocking on door]
- Wes?

21:37.556 --> 21:39.323
Wes!

21:41.877 --> 21:44.161
I can't believe you'd do this,
that you would take Sean

21:44.212 --> 21:46.163
without even having the guts
to talk to me about it first.

21:46.214 --> 21:47.832
I didn't have any say in any of this.

21:47.834 --> 21:49.951
You sat there on the phone with me
last night, asking me questions...

21:50.033 --> 21:51.353
I don't... I don't agree
with how this was handled,

21:51.401 --> 21:53.319
but Sean is the only one with inside
information about this thing.

21:53.403 --> 21:55.654
He's a person, not some object

21:55.705 --> 21:58.491
for you to have
your scientist experiments on.

21:58.542 --> 22:00.159
They're your scientists, too, Claire.

22:00.210 --> 22:01.660
They work for all of us.

22:02.610 --> 22:05.112
This isn't some underground,
mercenary operation.

22:05.611 --> 22:07.245
This is the sovereign, federal government

22:07.280 --> 22:09.115
of the United States of America
trying to protect our children

22:09.180 --> 22:10.647
from a threat that we
don't fully understand.

22:10.682 --> 22:12.349
But Sean does, Wes.

22:12.351 --> 22:18.288
This thing has... been inside
our homes, with our children.

22:18.690 --> 22:22.159
We haven't been able to do
a damn thing to stop it.

22:22.193 --> 22:25.162
Maybe he's right.

22:25.196 --> 22:31.118
Maybe the only way to save us
is [sighs] to destroy that rock.

22:31.669 --> 22:34.538
Sean is clouded by
the trauma he has been through.

22:34.540 --> 22:36.840
His judgment is impaired.

22:36.874 --> 22:38.708
And yours isn't?

22:38.759 --> 22:41.044
Did he tell you this was about us?

22:42.546 --> 22:45.715
So are you sure that you're...
Seeing this clearly?

22:45.717 --> 22:46.933
Hmm?

22:48.552 --> 22:51.187
You were there with those children, Claire.

22:51.222 --> 22:52.472
You were in that room.

22:52.523 --> 22:54.307
You were willing to let
those children be guinea pigs.

22:54.358 --> 22:55.976
So are you honestly saying
that you would be here

22:56.027 --> 22:57.811
trying to justify what he has done

22:57.862 --> 22:59.229
if he was not your husband?

22:59.231 --> 23:03.149
You need to determine who you believe,

23:03.200 --> 23:05.151
who do you trust, because this is an enemy

23:05.202 --> 23:09.539
and we need to fight it using
whatever and whomever we have.

23:16.514 --> 23:18.631
At least let me see him.

23:20.918 --> 23:24.387
I didn't even get
to talk to him last night.

23:24.421 --> 23:26.089
We just found him, Wes.

23:26.091 --> 23:30.059
Who knows who long
they're gonna keep him there?

23:32.593 --> 23:36.493
All of this... Everything
that has happened to him...

23:36.767 --> 23:39.602
is because of me...

23:39.653 --> 23:42.105
Us.

23:42.156 --> 23:46.809
Let me see him. Let me talk him.

23:46.844 --> 23:48.161
I owe him that.

23:50.147 --> 23:52.749
You owe him that.

23:52.783 --> 23:58.043
Okay. I'll make a call.

24:01.175 --> 24:05.628
Okay.

24:05.679 --> 24:08.464
[Door opens, closes]

24:08.515 --> 24:10.216
Dr. Tully: What do you think you're doing?

24:10.267 --> 24:12.135
Just trying to talk to you.

24:12.186 --> 24:14.770
You're trying to scare me.

24:14.805 --> 24:16.105
Sometimes, the truth is scary.

24:16.140 --> 24:18.441
Do you think you're the first military man

24:18.475 --> 24:20.142
to suggest that any visitor to our planet

24:20.177 --> 24:21.310
would want to hurt us?

24:21.361 --> 24:24.647
No, but I'm trying not to be the last.

24:24.698 --> 24:27.817
Look, you can hook me up to the rock,

24:27.868 --> 24:30.152
take brain scans,
test every nerve in my body,

24:30.203 --> 24:31.654
but there's one thing your lab work

24:31.705 --> 24:33.656
will <i> never</i> be able to tell you.

24:33.707 --> 24:34.874
And what's that?

24:34.908 --> 24:37.660
What I saw in the blue light.

24:39.329 --> 24:42.665
You brought me here
to learn from me, doctor.

24:42.667 --> 24:44.333
So learn from me.

24:44.335 --> 24:47.735
- And how am I supposed to...
- Just ask.

24:48.555 --> 24:50.473
Ask me what I saw.

25:04.905 --> 25:06.522
Here.

25:06.573 --> 25:08.858
Jessup: So, you want to tell me

25:08.909 --> 25:11.026
why you need a tactical vest
to watch your son?

25:11.028 --> 25:13.963
After what we saw yesterday,
do you feel safe?

25:13.997 --> 25:15.698
Not even a little.

25:15.749 --> 25:18.467
But if this thing is what you say it is,

25:18.501 --> 25:19.785
then wearing a flak jacket

25:19.836 --> 25:21.704
ain't gonna make a damn bit of difference.

25:21.755 --> 25:23.539
Uh, Claire...

25:23.590 --> 25:25.341
You're a good partner, Jessup.

25:25.408 --> 25:28.510
Thank you.

Look, just... Be careful, all right?

27:37.880 --> 27:39.247
Please.

27:39.298 --> 27:44.980
I'll do whatever it takes,
uh, whatever you want, just...

27:47.807 --> 27:50.091
Leave Minx out of it.

27:52.144 --> 27:53.595
Understand?

28:09.078 --> 28:11.029
Is Drill here?

28:11.063 --> 28:12.530
I want to talk to him.

28:12.532 --> 28:14.115
About what?

28:14.166 --> 28:18.903
I... I need... I need him to do something.

28:21.507 --> 28:25.794
He's not here, mommy,
but we can ask him later.

28:25.845 --> 28:27.045
Where is he?

28:27.096 --> 28:30.298
He's with a new friend...
an important friend.

28:32.384 --> 28:35.220
Why is this new friend so important, Minx?

28:35.287 --> 28:38.139
Sean: Something terrible is coming.

28:38.190 --> 28:43.811
Before I crashed,
I felt something enter my mind,

28:43.863 --> 28:45.647
as if something was ripping it apart

28:45.698 --> 28:47.315
looking through my memories.

28:47.366 --> 28:51.986
And that's when I had my first vision...

28:52.037 --> 28:54.989
a vision of things to come.

28:55.040 --> 28:56.824
And what did you see?

28:56.875 --> 28:59.661
[Sighs]

28:59.712 --> 29:01.662
First, I was at my house.

29:01.714 --> 29:03.548
Door was open...

29:03.582 --> 29:05.500
I called out.

29:05.551 --> 29:09.387
No one answered. They were all gone.

29:09.421 --> 29:12.924
Then, all of a sudden,
I was at this playground.

29:12.926 --> 29:16.094
The swings were still swinging.
[ <i>Children laughing</i> ]

29:16.096 --> 29:18.262
The carousel was still spinning
around and around,

29:18.264 --> 29:20.098
as if the kids were just there.

29:20.100 --> 29:23.267
And again, I called out, "Is anyone here?"

29:23.269 --> 29:26.604
No one answered.

29:26.606 --> 29:28.206
Then I was at this school...

29:28.240 --> 29:29.524
[ <i>Bell rings</i> ]

29:29.575 --> 29:34.529
hallways, classrooms... all empty.

29:37.916 --> 29:40.284

29:40.335 --> 29:43.754

29:43.789 --> 29:49.093
That's when I realized... It was all gone.

29:49.127 --> 29:51.362
Everyone was gone.

29:52.830 --> 29:54.765
Wes: Did she say
who the important friend was?

29:54.800 --> 29:56.767
No, just that this friend knows things...

29:56.802 --> 29:58.602
things that the other kids don't.

29:58.637 --> 30:00.636
With Drill, it's not about
the child. It never is.

30:00.936 --> 30:02.735
It's about who they
have access to... their parents.

30:02.736 --> 30:03.985
Well, do you know what he wants?

30:03.987 --> 30:05.737
Yeah, something
we're keeping hidden from him,

30:05.788 --> 30:07.071
something he can't get from Minx.

30:07.122 --> 30:09.157
Our computers are out of
the house, we won't discuss it.

30:09.208 --> 30:12.293
Who else knows where it is?

30:12.328 --> 30:14.829
Wes, what is it?

30:16.882 --> 30:18.499
- The doll.
- What doll?

he could do it to hurt someone.

we don't have much time.

Jessup: I'm here. I'm at the house, sir.

39:42.250 --> 39:44.034
I'd like to know what I'm doing here.

Frommer: You're there to pick up the kid.

39:48.022 --> 39:50.324
I'm sorry, sir. I don't follow.

39:50.358 --> 39:52.659
I believe my orders are loud and clear.

39:52.694 --> 39:55.829
Bennigan's son...
I want him in our custody.

Minx?

40:12.480 --> 40:16.616
What... What are you doing?

40:16.651 --> 40:17.651
Drill's here.

40:17.653 --> 40:20.120
I told Drill you want something from him,

40:20.154 --> 40:22.322
