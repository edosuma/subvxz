WEBVTT

00:00.068 --> 00:02.127
Okay, Salem, I'm off.
Now, you know the rules.

00:02.304 --> 00:04.966
Yeah, yeah.
No more sleeping in bras.

00:05.140 --> 00:07.165
I'm serious.
If you talk in front of a mortal,

00:07.342 --> 00:09.833
you're looking at another hundred
years trapped in a cat's body.

00:10.012 --> 00:11.912
- Ugh.
- See you later, guys.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.481
There's our girl,
off to her first day of work.

00:15.650 --> 00:17.174
They grow up so fast, don't they?

00:17.352 --> 00:21.015
Now, we know you're gonna be busy,
so Roxie made you a sack lunch.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.123
Guys,
I'm just going to my first day of work,

00:23.291 --> 00:25.122
not my first of day kindergarten.

00:25.293 --> 00:26.920
Hey, where's my juice box?

00:27.095 --> 00:28.187
So, nervous?

00:28.363 --> 00:30.524
Not really.
I've been a reporter for a while now.

00:30.699 --> 00:32.598
- You were an intern.
- And this is a magazine.

00:32.768 --> 00:34.395
It's totally different
than a newspaper.

00:34.569 --> 00:36.400
It has color pictures.

00:36.571 --> 00:37.595
Guys, it's just a job.

00:37.773 --> 00:40.173
Interviewing famous rock stars,
hanging out with celebrities,

00:40.342 --> 00:43.539
staying ahead of trends, working
with people with a lot more experience.

00:43.712 --> 00:44.804
Oh, my God. Bag.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.882
- Ugh. Tuna.
- You're gonna be great.

00:50.052 --> 00:51.178
Just be yourself.

00:51.353 --> 00:53.548
Or someone
slightly more interesting.

00:53.722 --> 00:55.656
You're right. I'm fine.

00:55.824 --> 00:57.917
Salem, get off my jacket.

00:58.093 --> 00:59.287
You ready to knock them dead?

00:59.928 --> 01:02.021
Yep. I feel confident.

01:02.197 --> 01:04.324
My hair looks good,
my outfit looks good.

01:04.498 --> 01:07.559
Everything's gonna be good.

01:10.105 --> 01:12.505
- Sabrina.
- What?

01:12.674 --> 01:14.403
Watch your back.

01:14.576 --> 01:16.373
That's so sweet.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:01.690 --> 02:04.454
<i>Yeah, agua.
Where would we be without it?</i>

02:04.993 --> 02:07.393
Well, I guess we'd pee a lot less.

02:07.562 --> 02:10.086
The new girl's got a naughty mouth.
I like that.

02:10.732 --> 02:12.666
Uh, listen, I'm supposed
to be meeting with Annie.

02:12.834 --> 02:15.769
But I've been waiting so long,
I might need to shave my legs again.

02:15.937 --> 02:18.428
Ha, ha. Yeah,
Annie's concept of time is a little fluid.

02:18.607 --> 02:20.370
You probably have time
to grab a latte.

02:20.542 --> 02:21.975
Or grow a redwood.

02:23.345 --> 02:25.506
- First day, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.204
- First days are kind of hard.
- Yeah.

02:27.382 --> 02:29.213
Lots of questions.
What am I supposed to do?

02:29.384 --> 02:31.079
Where do I park?
Who do I eat lunch with?

02:31.253 --> 02:33.915
- I'll eat lunch with you.
- Actually, that was sort of rhetorical.

02:34.089 --> 02:35.386
I brought my lunch.

02:35.557 --> 02:37.388
Oh, your mom
packs your lunch too, huh?

02:37.993 --> 02:40.484
So, uh, Leonard, right?

02:40.662 --> 02:41.959
What do you do here?

02:42.430 --> 02:46.366
Oh, I'm, uh... I'm the publisher's
right-hand man. His go-to guy.

02:46.535 --> 02:50.494
His vice president of "I'm losing
my mind, help me put my pants on. "

02:50.672 --> 02:51.730
He sells ad space.

02:51.907 --> 02:55.070
Oh, Leonard, by the way, uh,
we need more toner.

02:56.411 --> 02:59.437
I do many things here.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.912
Uh, listen, I think I'm just gonna
knock on Annie's door.

03:02.083 --> 03:05.416
No, it's just... What I really am
is, uh, the idea guy.

03:05.587 --> 03:09.523
Like my idea for the, uh, Limp Biscuit
Scratch and Sniff centerfold.

03:09.691 --> 03:10.715
Awesome, no?

03:11.293 --> 03:12.851
Maybe if it smelled like biscuits.

03:16.831 --> 03:19.231
Might smell like biscuits.

03:23.238 --> 03:25.604
Um, excuse me. Hi, I've been
waiting out here for a meeting.

03:25.774 --> 03:27.298
- I suddenly thought that maybe...
- Sit.

03:27.475 --> 03:28.601
Exactly.

03:30.779 --> 03:33.373
So, um, we met the other day.
You're the senior editor, right?

03:34.015 --> 03:35.073
You're very close.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.912
I knew you were up there, because
you have amazing self-confidence.

03:38.086 --> 03:41.055
You're sitting very close.
You're practically on my lap.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.116
Gotcha.

03:43.291 --> 03:44.553
I'm a little nervous, ha, ha.

03:44.726 --> 03:47.718
See, this job came out of nowhere,
and while I'm excited about it,

03:47.896 --> 03:51.059
I also don't know what it is, and once
I stop talking, you'll explain it to me.

03:51.233 --> 03:52.257
Here's the deal.

03:52.434 --> 03:54.425
<i>Scorch Magazine
focuses on everything</i>

03:54.603 --> 03:57.436
and anything that's cutting edge
with an emphasis on music.

03:57.606 --> 03:59.096
Jonathan Culver, our publisher,

03:59.274 --> 04:01.674
thinks you'd bring a fresh perspective
to the magazine.

04:01.843 --> 04:04.971
But I do have a fresh perspective.
I mean, I'm beyond fresh, I'm ripe.

04:05.146 --> 04:06.773
But that's mostly
from being nervous.

04:08.383 --> 04:10.248
So, uh, what's my first assignment?

04:10.418 --> 04:13.114
Why don't you go see
if the intern wants some water?

04:13.288 --> 04:15.313
Uh, wait a minute.
I'm here to be a reporter.

04:15.490 --> 04:17.151
There's gotta be something
I can report.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.815
Oh, what about this?

04:18.994 --> 04:20.291
Nope, that's taken.

04:20.462 --> 04:22.521
- By whom?
- Me, I just took it.

04:23.365 --> 04:25.925
Oh, come on, do you actually
expect me to allow an unproven writer

04:26.101 --> 04:28.899
to interview a major rock star
on her first day?

04:29.070 --> 04:30.935
Come on, I know
you have low expectations of me,

04:31.106 --> 04:32.232
and I promise I'll meet them.

04:32.407 --> 04:34.238
I mean, exceed them.

04:35.243 --> 04:37.734
All right, fine. Your first assignment.

04:37.912 --> 04:39.174
You and our photographer, James,

04:39.347 --> 04:41.281
are going to the Cape
to do a profile on Strum.

04:42.784 --> 04:45.548
- You do know who Strum is?
- Oh, sure, the musician. I love him.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.450
<i>You know, I saw that film he did with
Jakob Dylan, Strum and Strummer.</i>

04:50.325 --> 04:52.350
Okay, the humor thing?
The witty banter?

04:52.527 --> 04:54.154
- I don't do it.
- Okay, right.

04:54.329 --> 04:55.489
No humor. No jokes.

04:55.664 --> 04:57.598
I won't even say,
"knock, knock" when I enter.

04:58.600 --> 04:59.794
Did I read about you?

04:59.968 --> 05:02.766
Are you the little girl
who couldn't smile?

05:04.639 --> 05:06.630
<i>Since I can't ask you
for the cream cheese,</i>

05:06.808 --> 05:09.675
<i>I'm gonna stare at you
till you give it up.</i>

05:10.078 --> 05:12.512
Oh, I hate
when this cat stares at me.

05:12.681 --> 05:14.842
At least you got the end with eyes.

05:15.016 --> 05:18.782
You know, he jumps on the table,
he gets on the couch.

05:18.953 --> 05:20.887
Sabrina's aunts
gave him way too much leeway.

05:21.056 --> 05:22.614
We have gotta discipline him.

05:22.791 --> 05:24.383
Look, Morgan,
you're not an animal person.

05:24.559 --> 05:27.824
If he's on the table, just say,
"Kitty, get off the table. "

05:27.996 --> 05:29.623
<i>Yeah, look at me scamper.</i>

05:29.798 --> 05:32.358
See?
We're just gonna have to train him.

05:32.534 --> 05:34.764
He's a cat, Morgan.
You don't train cats.

05:34.936 --> 05:37.268
You just live with them
in case you never get married.

05:37.439 --> 05:39.430
Well, we'll see about that.

05:39.607 --> 05:43.976
It's time to learn some manners,
Mr. Hair-All-Over-The-Place.

05:44.145 --> 05:45.169
<i>You should talk.</i>

05:45.347 --> 05:47.713
<i>You got enough mustache
to be an assistant coach.</i>

05:47.882 --> 05:51.648
So, Mr. Strum spent so much money
building a personal gym,

05:51.820 --> 05:53.651
he couldn't afford a watch?

05:53.822 --> 05:56.154
I'll tell you,
this place really takes me back.

05:56.591 --> 05:58.752
- I used to be a personal trainer.
- Really?

05:58.927 --> 06:01.088
Yeah, watch yourself.

06:04.599 --> 06:07.432
All right, well, they changed
the equipment since then.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.768
I'm so sorry I'm late.

06:11.206 --> 06:12.730
What's up, dawg, how's it going?

06:12.907 --> 06:15.273
- It's been a long time.
- Yeah, too long.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.501
The pool's filthy.

06:16.678 --> 06:18.873
Oh, no, uh, Strum,
this is James, our photographer.

06:19.047 --> 06:20.947
And I'm Sabrina Spellman,
the reporter.

06:21.116 --> 06:22.378
I have all your CDs.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.984
Well, actually they're MP3s
I downloaded off...

06:25.153 --> 06:27.246
Okay,
let's get straight to the interview.

06:27.422 --> 06:31.188
So, um, I understand you're
in the studio working on a new CD.

06:31.359 --> 06:32.383
Do you have a title?

06:32.560 --> 06:34.994
- Move.
- Oh, that's cool.

06:35.163 --> 06:38.826
No, sweetheart. Move.
I can't see myself.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.428
Sorry.

06:41.202 --> 06:43.227
Sweat, please.

06:44.906 --> 06:46.100
Sneeze coming.

06:47.776 --> 06:51.576
Now, get out of here with that.
And don't let me catch that on eBay.

06:54.315 --> 06:57.876
Uh, so, Strum, um,
who were your musical influences?

06:58.052 --> 07:02.045
Well, I'd have to say my biggest
influence was early Brian Ardmore.

07:02.223 --> 07:04.350
Oh, I'm not familiar
with Brian Ardmore.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.060
That was me
before I changed my name.

07:09.330 --> 07:11.195
Dude,
if you're not gonna take pictures,

07:11.366 --> 07:12.663
you might as well clean the pool.

07:12.834 --> 07:15.200
I mean,
I'm not doing this for my health.

07:17.338 --> 07:19.670
Excuse me. These weights
aren't gonna lift themselves.

07:21.676 --> 07:23.610
Do you think you can fit
that ego in the shot?

07:23.778 --> 07:25.803
If I take it from the Hubble.

07:26.481 --> 07:30.508
After Salem turned my latest fashion
design into a scratching post,

07:30.685 --> 07:34.348
I decided to buy
the ultimate cat-training system.

07:34.522 --> 07:38.458
<i>Nice, but I believe
it's pearls that go with basic black.</i>

07:38.626 --> 07:41.322
How is a crummy cat collar
gonna keep him off the furniture?

07:41.496 --> 07:43.327
Oh, that's no ordinary collar.

07:43.498 --> 07:45.295
As soon as he jumps
on the furniture...

07:46.835 --> 07:47.859
Morgan.

07:48.236 --> 07:50.670
Relax. It's perfectly humane.

07:50.839 --> 07:53.967
It says right here,
"Not tested on animals. "

07:54.142 --> 07:58.340
<i>You sadistic ditz.
Sabrina will never stand for this.</i>

07:58.513 --> 08:00.981
Well, I finished my article
on Strum, and I gotta say,

08:01.149 --> 08:04.448
I'm usually my own worst critic,
but it's perfect.

08:04.619 --> 08:05.745
I mean, when Annie sees this,

08:05.920 --> 08:08.388
she's gonna be thrilled
that I was forced on her.

08:08.556 --> 08:12.014
Listen, Sabrina, would mind
if we started training the cat?

08:12.193 --> 08:14.627
<i>Of course she'd mind.
Tell her, Sabrina.</i>

08:15.396 --> 08:16.420
Yeah, sure, whatever.

08:16.598 --> 08:18.156
<i>Huh?</i>

08:20.001 --> 08:21.992
I think you had it set too high.

08:22.170 --> 08:23.501
I had it on "cat. "

08:24.973 --> 08:26.463
Oh, "cattle. "

08:30.111 --> 08:31.203
Hey, what's going on?

08:31.379 --> 08:33.677
I'm so excited.
I just handed in my article to Annie.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.905
I hope she likes it.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.812
What am I saying?
I hope she loves it.

08:36.985 --> 08:39.111
- Oh, I'm Sabrina, by the way.
- Oh, Cole Harper.

08:39.287 --> 08:41.278
<i>Right, you used to write
for Rolling Stone Magazine.</i>

08:41.456 --> 08:43.515
I've been reading your articles
since I was in high...

08:43.691 --> 08:46.057
- Hi, how you doing?
- Good, good.

08:46.227 --> 08:49.390
- So I see you made yourself at home.
- Yeah, just settling in.

08:49.564 --> 08:50.929
So where do you sit?

08:51.099 --> 08:53.829
Well, right now someone's
at my desk, so I'm just kind of floating.

08:54.002 --> 08:56.698
Don't you hate that?
I haven't been given a desk yet.

08:56.871 --> 08:58.805
Oh, I have.

08:58.973 --> 09:01.908
- And you're in it.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

09:02.076 --> 09:03.907
Nobody's told me
where I'm supposed to sit yet.

09:04.078 --> 09:05.943
Well, that may not be necessary.

09:06.114 --> 09:08.947
- We can't use this.
- Well, what's wrong with it?

09:09.117 --> 09:10.744
It's a puff piece. A love letter.

09:11.452 --> 09:14.353
I could have used the fourth paragraph
to sweeten my coffee.

09:14.522 --> 09:16.046
Well, you know,
if you had kept reading,

09:16.224 --> 09:19.022
you would have noticed I mentioned
he was late and his pool was cloudy.

09:20.562 --> 09:23.463
Nice, nice, very nice.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.155
Thank you, that's what I thought.

09:25.333 --> 09:28.131
No, you used the word "nice"
three times in one paragraph.

09:28.303 --> 09:30.931
Look, Strum is a big star.
Now, what was I supposed to say?

09:31.105 --> 09:33.596
That he was the most pompous,
arrogant jerk I've ever met?

09:33.775 --> 09:35.367
- I'd read that.
- Right.

09:35.543 --> 09:38.535
Seriously, people wanna know
what celebrities are really like.

09:38.713 --> 09:41.307
So I'm just supposed
to be brutally honest?

09:41.783 --> 09:43.842
Which may be hard
for someone like you.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.645
Oh, I can do it if I have to.

09:45.820 --> 09:47.014
I'm gonna go in there right now

09:47.188 --> 09:48.849
and tell Annie
exactly what I think of her.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.451
Or I could just rewrite this article.

10:44.345 --> 10:45.710
Done.

10:46.614 --> 10:49.742
- Phew. I'm fried.
- Oh, you're fried?

10:49.917 --> 10:51.885
I smell like a bad perm.

10:54.589 --> 10:56.955
"The Ego has Landed"
by Sabrina Spellman.

10:58.126 --> 10:59.957
"Conceit of his pants. " Clever.

11:00.495 --> 11:03.464
"Strum's so vain, he probably
thinks this article's about him. "

11:03.631 --> 11:04.893
- Good one.
- Yeah.

11:05.066 --> 11:08.593
Wait till you get to the part about him
bending backwards to kiss his butt.

11:08.770 --> 11:10.738
So I guess
now that you've been published,

11:10.905 --> 11:12.566
we should actually give you a desk.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.469
Why don't you take
that one right there?

11:14.642 --> 11:17.236
Really? Great.

11:17.412 --> 11:18.606
Wow.

11:18.780 --> 11:21.248
I finally feel like I'm finally here.

11:21.416 --> 11:22.815
I want her fired.

11:23.618 --> 11:25.210
Well, that was nice while it lasted.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.355
No one is getting fired.
I stand by my writer.

11:33.528 --> 11:34.586
I'm not gonna silence her.

11:34.762 --> 11:35.820
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

11:35.997 --> 11:37.021
If you don't fire her,

11:37.198 --> 11:39.257
then I'll tell every one
of my music industry friends

11:39.434 --> 11:41.095
never to talk
to your magazine again.

11:41.269 --> 11:43.499
Oh, that's two interviews
we're gonna have to do without.

11:43.671 --> 11:46.538
You won't fire her? Then I'll sue.

11:46.708 --> 11:48.505
Sue away.
My editor stands by my story.

11:48.676 --> 11:51.440
Okay, how about if she prints
a retraction in the next issue?

11:51.612 --> 11:54.376
- What? I'm not writing a retraction.
- Well, I'm not getting sued.

11:54.549 --> 11:56.608
- How about a public apology?
Wait a minute.

11:56.784 --> 11:57.808
- Would that work?
- No.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.146
- How about at tomorrow's concert?
- Hello?

12:00.321 --> 12:03.449
Maybe she could be dancing
in a big tub of bean dip.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.925
Oh, right, I went too far.

12:07.095 --> 12:09.563
Deal. I'll see you on-stage.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.022
Thanks, guys.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.997
This was a great day
for the First Amendment.

12:14.168 --> 12:15.897
Is anybody listening to me?

12:16.070 --> 12:18.265
I am, Sabrina. I'm here for you.

12:18.439 --> 12:20.430
Anybody at all?

12:21.709 --> 12:23.404
Here, Salem, it's all yours.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.039
I'm too worked up to eat.

12:25.213 --> 12:28.876
Oh, no.
I'm not jumping on any furniture.

12:29.050 --> 12:30.847
Your friends broke me.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.418
Well, at least now
you'll stop throwing out your hip.

12:33.588 --> 12:36.853
Are you still mumbling to yourself
about this whole apology thing?

12:37.024 --> 12:38.514
This really stinks.

12:38.693 --> 12:41.753
I mean, if I apologize,
then I give up everything I believe in.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.124
If I don't, only thing
I'll be writing is bad checks.

12:44.298 --> 12:46.323
Oh, please, it's a no-brainer.

12:46.501 --> 12:48.128
To be on-stage with Strum?

12:48.302 --> 12:51.100
I'd give up anything,
including my dignity.

12:51.272 --> 12:53.763
<i>You gave that up when you appeared
in Girls Gone Wild 8.</i>

12:54.909 --> 12:57.309
Look, Sabrina, how would you feel
if you got up on that stage

12:57.478 --> 12:59.537
and let everyone in the world
see you grovel?

12:59.714 --> 13:02.979
Demeaned, degraded, de...
Not very happy.

13:03.151 --> 13:04.209
Then there you go.

13:04.752 --> 13:05.980
Thanks, Roxie.

13:07.922 --> 13:09.219
While you're handing out thanks,

13:09.390 --> 13:12.553
how about thanking the person
that's been training your cat all week?

13:13.694 --> 13:17.460
Salem, bring me my mascara.

13:19.767 --> 13:21.701
Prepare to be amazed.

13:23.571 --> 13:25.971
Wow. Talk about whipped.

13:26.140 --> 13:28.301
Thank you, Salem.

13:28.476 --> 13:31.172
Who's my good boy?
Who's my good boy?

13:34.415 --> 13:37.213
Annie, I've got something to tell you.
I've given this a lot of thought,

13:37.385 --> 13:39.683
and I've decided I'm not gonna
go through with the apology.

13:39.854 --> 13:40.878
- Fine.
- Fine?

13:41.055 --> 13:42.920
- Fine.
- Fine as in you're in fine with it,

13:43.090 --> 13:44.853
or fine as in find another job?

13:45.026 --> 13:47.426
That's not up to me.
I'll let Jonathan know of your decision.

13:47.862 --> 13:49.454
Well, um,
maybe I should go tell Jonathan.

13:49.630 --> 13:51.928
That way you can stay here
and continue frightening people.

13:52.733 --> 13:53.927
You can't speak with Jonathan.

13:54.101 --> 13:57.730
He sets the bar for trends around here,
and right now, human contact is out.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.635
Fine. I just wanted to let you know
I'm not apologizing to Strum.

14:00.808 --> 14:02.469
- Yeah, I heard you the first time.
- Good.

14:02.643 --> 14:04.702
Then I've said everything
I came in here to say.

14:04.879 --> 14:06.437
Twice.

14:08.983 --> 14:12.146
Sabrina, have you decided what you're
gonna wear to the concert tonight?

14:12.320 --> 14:14.254
Because whenever my girlfriends
have to apologize,

14:14.422 --> 14:17.016
I find a halter-top
puts me in a very forgiving mood.

14:17.191 --> 14:19.284
What makes you think
I'm gonna apologize?

14:19.460 --> 14:22.327
And whatever happened
to standing up for what you believe in?

14:22.496 --> 14:25.624
Well, actually, nothing, if you're
Nelson Mandela or Mother Teresa.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.893
But we ain't saving the lives
of starving people here.

14:28.069 --> 14:30.333
We're just telling them
what to dance to.

14:30.738 --> 14:33.707
Just between you and me,
very smart move giving in.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.069
It took me six months to learn

14:35.243 --> 14:37.370
that if you don't fight them
when they're pantsing you,

14:37.545 --> 14:39.172
they don't run them up the flagpole.

14:39.347 --> 14:41.941
- Kids can be so cruel.
- Oh, yeah.

14:42.116 --> 14:44.550
Thirteen-year-olds
are much bigger than they used to be.

14:47.088 --> 14:48.988
Hey, when you do
this apology thing...

14:49.156 --> 14:50.214
I'm not doing it.

14:50.391 --> 14:52.291
Really? Wow.

14:52.460 --> 14:55.429
I mean, when I first started out
as a reporter, I was idealistic.

14:55.596 --> 15:00.590
I wanted to free political prisoners,
save the ozone, expose corruption.

15:00.768 --> 15:02.429
Then I decided
I wanted a Harley more.

15:02.870 --> 15:05.236
You sold out that easily?

15:05.406 --> 15:08.671
- Compromise is part of the business.
- What are you talking about?

15:08.843 --> 15:11.676
You're the one who got me into this.
You told me to be brutally honest.

15:11.846 --> 15:13.780
Brutal honesty has its place.

15:13.948 --> 15:16.712
But then again,
so does keeping your job.

15:17.518 --> 15:20.248
- Listen, Annie, about the apology.
- Yes?

15:21.055 --> 15:23.182
Do you know a good place
to buy a halter-top? Ha, ha.

15:29.263 --> 15:31.823
Uh, just out of curiosity,

15:31.999 --> 15:35.366
how come there weren't
any white cats on death row?

15:40.975 --> 15:44.911
I wonder if I can flip this cushion.

15:46.614 --> 15:49.674
Hey, can we do this? Sounds like the
audience is getting a little impatient.

15:49.850 --> 15:51.681
That's not the audience.

15:51.852 --> 15:54.013
Just part of my pre-concert ritual.

15:54.188 --> 15:55.348
Oh, speaking of which.

15:55.990 --> 15:57.321
My pills.

15:57.491 --> 16:00.858
The ego, the drugs.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.724
All that's missing
is a brief loveless marriage to J-Lo.

16:04.165 --> 16:05.427
It was an antihistamine, honey.

16:06.801 --> 16:08.598
I'm allergic to the flowers
I sent myself.

16:08.769 --> 16:10.066
Great, can we get this over with?

16:10.237 --> 16:12.671
I still have a tiny shred of dignity
lodged behind my spleen.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.332
- Hey, I like the halter.
- Oops. There it goes.

16:16.510 --> 16:18.410
Let's go. They're waiting.

16:18.579 --> 16:22.208
Well, go on.
Get the girls screaming for me, okay?

16:22.917 --> 16:25.112
Oh, I had an idea.

16:25.286 --> 16:28.050
You know, saying you're sorry
may not have enough impact.

16:28.823 --> 16:31.314
<i>So I'm gonna roll up a copy
of this Scorch Magazine,</i>

16:31.492 --> 16:34.154
you'll bend over
and I'll spank you with it.

16:34.328 --> 16:35.989
- It's great.
- Oh, that's it. Forget it.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.131
- I'm not doing it.
- Excuse me?

16:38.299 --> 16:39.391
Well, I'm not apologizing.

16:39.567 --> 16:41.967
And I'm not letting anyone
spank me on-stage.

16:42.136 --> 16:44.696
Well, maybe if it was Dave Matthews
and it was more of a love tap.

16:44.872 --> 16:47.067
I'm sorry, are you still talking?

16:47.241 --> 16:49.505
Why should I compromise
my self-respect just for some job?

16:49.677 --> 16:52.874
Everything I wrote about you is true.
You're a narcissistic, arrogant jerk,

16:53.047 --> 16:54.844
and I never met anyone
with such a big head.

16:55.016 --> 16:58.952
Excuse me, you're confusing
a big head with self-confidence.

16:59.120 --> 17:02.521
- Now, move it.
- Oh, now you've done it.

17:02.690 --> 17:05.386
<i>Make this blow-hard realize
His empty head is super-sized</i>

17:06.993 --> 17:10.156
Time to give these mall rats
the minimum effort.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.891
They're gonna be talking
about this concert for years.

17:13.067 --> 17:15.934
Hello, Boston. Yeah.

17:17.371 --> 17:18.963
That's weird.

17:19.140 --> 17:20.664
My head.

17:21.242 --> 17:23.233
It's huge.

17:25.780 --> 17:26.872
Darn allergies.

17:27.415 --> 17:29.645
Or maybe your mind's
trying to tell you something.

17:29.817 --> 17:32.149
Maybe this wouldn't be happening
if you weren't so arrogant.

17:32.319 --> 17:35.982
- Have you ever tried being humble?
- Yeah, for about two weeks.

17:36.157 --> 17:38.557
And then all of a sudden
I found out somebody had that name.

17:38.726 --> 17:41.456
Come on, Strum.
The crowd's getting restless.

17:41.629 --> 17:43.494
- Okay, well, good luck.
- Wait, wait.

17:43.664 --> 17:46.758
You gotta help me.
What am I gonna do?

17:46.934 --> 17:49.528
I'd start recognizing that there
are other people in this world.

17:49.703 --> 17:51.295
I know there's other people.

17:51.472 --> 17:53.497
I mean,
some of them bring me things.

17:55.443 --> 17:56.467
Okay.

17:56.644 --> 18:01.911
I guess some of my success comes
from those who write my songs.

18:03.284 --> 18:04.410
It's working.

18:04.585 --> 18:07.452
And I guess it wasn't right
to demand all the royalties

18:07.621 --> 18:10.249
from those beginner guitar books.

18:11.792 --> 18:13.054
Good.

18:13.227 --> 18:15.320
And perhaps it wasn't right
to tell Muhammad Ali

18:15.496 --> 18:17.327
that I'm actually the greatest.

18:17.498 --> 18:19.466
Although I bet I could take him.

18:19.633 --> 18:21.658
Okay, maybe not.

18:22.470 --> 18:24.461
Oh, look at that. Back to normal.

18:24.638 --> 18:28.199
<i>Now forget the inflated head
Remember the ego lesson instead</i>

18:28.509 --> 18:32.570
Phew.
Not a hair out of place. Thank God.

18:32.746 --> 18:35.715
Oh, yeah. Thank you too.

18:35.883 --> 18:37.646
I guess we can let the apology slide
for now.

18:38.085 --> 18:39.109
Thanks.

18:39.286 --> 18:42.255
But if you're up for a private spanking,
the show's over after midnight.

18:42.423 --> 18:45.449
Oh, bummer, I'm already booked
for a wedgie at 11:30.

18:58.239 --> 19:01.402
Come on, Red. It's payback time.

19:01.575 --> 19:05.067
Good kitty. Not on the furniture.

19:05.246 --> 19:07.612
And for being so good,

19:07.781 --> 19:10.477
I am gonna give you
an extra special treat.

19:10.651 --> 19:13.484
<i>And I'm gonna help them
pull you down off the moon.</i>

19:13.654 --> 19:16.214
You can join me on the couch.

19:16.390 --> 19:17.516
<i>What?</i>

19:18.192 --> 19:22.356
Now, I am gonna go get some popcorn
for me and some liver treats for you.

19:22.530 --> 19:23.554
I'll be right back.

19:26.100 --> 19:27.692
Relax.

19:27.868 --> 19:32.202
Mama says it's okay
to be on the furniture now.

19:32.373 --> 19:33.863
<i>No!</i>

19:39.380 --> 19:40.404
Oh, good, you're here.

19:40.581 --> 19:43.709
I wanted to let you know that I didn't
apologize at Strum's concert tonight.

19:43.884 --> 19:46.717
<i>He wanted to spank me
with a rolled-up copy of Scorch.</i>

19:46.887 --> 19:48.354
Anyway, to make a long story short...

19:48.522 --> 19:50.387
Someone else
would have to be telling it.

19:50.558 --> 19:52.492
Anyway,
I just wanted you to hear it from me.

19:52.660 --> 19:54.491
- Nice going.
- Really? Thanks.

19:55.429 --> 19:57.727
Wait, let me try that again
with a little more sarcasm.

19:57.898 --> 19:58.990
Nice going.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.091
Since you're too high and mighty
to take one for the team,

20:02.269 --> 20:04.328
we missed out
on a ton of free publicity.

20:04.505 --> 20:07.099
Now, I have to finish
passing out these memos.

20:07.274 --> 20:09.868
Well, clearly hiring me
was a failed experiment.

20:10.044 --> 20:13.377
So tell Jonathan thanks for the chance
and sorry it didn't work out.

20:13.781 --> 20:14.907
All right. See you tomorrow.

20:15.549 --> 20:17.312
Wait, I'm fired, right?

20:17.484 --> 20:19.315
I mean,
that was my farewell speech.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.113
And it needs work.

20:21.755 --> 20:24.383
Jonathan hired you.
Only Jonathan can fire you.

20:24.558 --> 20:27.356
And frankly, I wouldn't get rid of you
for all the gin in Hyannis Port.

20:28.662 --> 20:32.257
I don't know what you're saying,
but the gin comment explains a lot.

20:32.433 --> 20:34.924
Look, I'm the kind of person
who likes car wrecks,

20:35.102 --> 20:37.070
explosions and reality television.

20:37.238 --> 20:40.935
And you are this bizarre
combination of all of those.

20:41.108 --> 20:43.201
I am going to look forward every day

20:43.377 --> 20:45.845
to seeing what kind of disaster
you can create for yourself.

20:46.413 --> 20:50.076
Oh, you have no idea.
I am like an earthquake at Legoland.

20:50.451 --> 20:54.512
There was this one time when I...
Too close, right? Too close.

21:00.961 --> 21:03.828
Oh, quit complaining, you big baby.
It wasn't that bad.

21:03.998 --> 21:07.195
Tell that to the piece of charcoal
that used to be my thyroid.

21:07.368 --> 21:10.166
I know you had a difficult week,
but I hope you learned something.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.395
I did.

21:11.572 --> 21:15.235
How to stay off the couch,
and how to poop in a size eight pump.

21:15.409 --> 21:16.433
What?

21:16.610 --> 21:18.339
Salem!
- Ha. I'm out of here.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.838
Not so fast.
