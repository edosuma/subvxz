08:19.707 --> 08:21.751
actually a bird?

08:21.793 --> 08:24.463
Oh! I don't know because you

08:21.793 --> 08:24.463
haven't told me anything yet!

08:25.005 --> 08:26.423
You'll like him.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.549
We have a lot in common.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.260
Well, I love you,

08:30.302 --> 08:32.429
so I know I'm going to

08:30.302 --> 08:32.429
love your boyfriend!

08:32.471 --> 08:34.514
Oh! I can't wait

08:32.471 --> 08:34.514
to meet him!

08:35.349 --> 08:36.516
You don't have to.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.311
[gasp]

08:39.353 --> 08:40.937
He's a rock!

08:40.979 --> 08:44.065
And you love rocks,

08:40.979 --> 08:44.065
so it's perfect.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.276
Is Boulder jealous?

08:46.318 --> 08:48.569
No, behind the rock.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.572
Mudbriar, are you back there?

08:51.614 --> 08:53.616
Technically?

08:51.614 --> 08:53.616
Not anymore.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.536
Wha wha whaaaaa?

09:01.624 --> 09:05.128
Pinkie Pie,

09:01.624 --> 09:05.128
meet Mudbriar.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.254
Technically?

09:06.296 --> 09:07.630
We've already met.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.466
You...?

09:09.508 --> 09:10.384
Yes.

09:10.425 --> 09:11.676
You?

09:11.718 --> 09:12.593
Yes.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.262
You.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.306
Yes.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.140
I mean...

09:17.182 --> 09:18.517
haha, you!

09:18.558 --> 09:20.977
You! You! You!

09:21.019 --> 09:23.688
Yes. Yes. Yes.

09:24.523 --> 09:26.441
I'm sorry, let's

09:24.523 --> 09:26.441
start over.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.277
Hi! I'm Maud's

09:26.483 --> 09:29.277
sister, Pinkie Pie.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.987
I know.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.865
So...

09:34.491 --> 09:35.616
How did...

09:35.658 --> 09:37.994
You two meet?

09:38.661 --> 09:40.163
At a rock show.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.082
Oh, you're into

09:40.205 --> 09:42.082
rocks too?

09:42.123 --> 09:45.210
No. I like sticks.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.712
Then why were you

09:45.252 --> 09:47.712
at a rock show?

09:47.754 --> 09:51.341
It was a petrified wood show,

09:47.754 --> 09:51.341
which technically

09:51.383 --> 09:53.176
makes it a stick show.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.636
Except that in the

09:53.218 --> 09:55.636
permineralization process

09:55.678 --> 09:59.099
of petrification, all organic

09:55.678 --> 09:59.099
material is replaced with

09:59.140 --> 10:02.018
silicates, i.e. rocks...

10:02.060 --> 10:05.688
...while retaining the original

10:02.060 --> 10:05.688
structural elements of wood.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.691
Q.E.D. It was a stick show.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.652
I'm... really

10:08.733 --> 10:11.652
into sticks too!

10:11.694 --> 10:13.863
They're great for

10:11.694 --> 10:13.863
hitting piñatas!

10:14.489 --> 10:15.615
Aaahhh!

10:16.699 --> 10:18.452
Pinkie!

10:18.493 --> 10:20.537
Oh, you

10:18.493 --> 10:20.537
wanna go first?

10:20.579 --> 10:22.539
That is stick abuse.

10:22.581 --> 10:23.457
It is?

10:24.791 --> 10:26.126
I'm sorry.

10:26.167 --> 10:29.670
Oh, this is awful, I am not

10:26.167 --> 10:29.670
being a very good sister.

10:29.712 --> 10:30.671
Let's start over.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.966
I'm Pinkie Pie,

10:30.713 --> 10:32.966
nice to meet you.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.634
Technically?

10:34.759 --> 10:36.261
We've already met.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.389
You should introduce

10:36.719 --> 10:39.389
Pinkie to your pet.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.224
Oh!

10:41.266 --> 10:42.683
Your pet likes fetch!

10:42.725 --> 10:44.685
This<i> is</i> my pet.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.187
So no.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.692
Aw. Look at Twiggy and

10:48.731 --> 10:51.692
Boulder playing together.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.321
They're adorable.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.697
It's just a stick.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.158
Don't be rude.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.701
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

11:00.743 --> 11:02.454
One more time...

11:02.496 --> 11:05.706
I'm Pinkie Pie,

11:02.496 --> 11:05.706
nice to meet you.

11:05.748 --> 11:06.707
Technically...

11:06.749 --> 11:08.543
We've already met.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.170
[growl]

11:12.255 --> 11:15.800
[flowing water]

11:15.842 --> 11:16.717
Ahhhh!

11:16.759 --> 11:18.011
I don't get this guy!

11:19.596 --> 11:21.722
Wow! Maud has a boyfriend?

11:21.764 --> 11:22.807
Agh!

11:22.849 --> 11:24.601
How can she like

11:22.849 --> 11:24.601
someone so weird?

11:27.395 --> 11:29.648
He has an inanimate

11:27.395 --> 11:29.648
object for a pet!

11:30.190 --> 11:31.358
So does Maud.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.527
Boulder has ten times

11:31.399 --> 11:33.527
the personality

11:33.568 --> 11:35.320
of some random stick.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.738
Mudbriar too, for that matter.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.574
He's not like Maud at all.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.702
Maud is hilarious, friendly,

11:40.367 --> 11:43.702
caring, and easy to talk to!

11:44.204 --> 11:45.704
Yup, that's Maud.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.750
But this guy is awkward,

11:46.331 --> 11:49.750
quiet, and kind of...

11:49.792 --> 11:51.503
strange!

11:51.545 --> 11:53.754
Uh, that also

11:51.545 --> 11:53.754
sounds like Maud.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.550
Hah! You're so

11:54.381 --> 11:56.550
funny, Starlight!

11:56.591 --> 11:58.009
Maud is nothing

11:56.591 --> 11:58.009
like Mudbriar.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.179
If she were, then we wouldn't

11:58.051 --> 12:01.179
be best sister friends forever.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.765
Well, Maud obviously

12:01.804 --> 12:04.765
likes something about him.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.767
[growl]

12:06.809 --> 12:09.145
Maybe you just need to

12:06.809 --> 12:09.145
spend more time with him,

12:09.187 --> 12:10.480
find out what you

12:09.187 --> 12:10.480
have in common.

12:10.855 --> 12:11.772
That's easy.

12:11.814 --> 12:12.691
Nothing!

12:14.275 --> 12:16.444
You both care

12:14.275 --> 12:16.444
about Maud.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.863
I know! He could help

12:16.486 --> 12:18.863
you with her party!

12:19.280 --> 12:20.781
I guess.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.326
And I'll keep Maud busy

12:20.823 --> 12:23.326
while you and Mudbriar

12:23.368 --> 12:25.370
plan the best surprise

12:23.368 --> 12:25.370
birthday ever!

12:26.246 --> 12:28.039
That, I can do.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.586
Listen. Maud's

12:30.833 --> 12:32.586
birthday is tomorrow

12:32.627 --> 12:34.588
and there's no

12:32.627 --> 12:34.588
time to waste.

12:34.629 --> 12:35.838
You're not afraid

12:34.629 --> 12:35.838
of slides, are you?

12:35.880 --> 12:38.592
No, wh-aaaahhhhhhhh!

12:38.633 --> 12:39.467
[crash]

12:39.509 --> 12:40.385
No reason!

12:40.427 --> 12:41.760
Weeeeee!

12:43.888 --> 12:46.140
[crash]

12:43.888 --> 12:46.140
[yell]

12:48.268 --> 12:51.479
Welcome to my party

12:48.268 --> 12:51.479
planning cave!

12:52.897 --> 12:54.065
Technically?

12:54.107 --> 12:56.817
Due to the speleothems

12:54.107 --> 12:56.817
growing from the ceiling,

12:56.859 --> 12:59.362
this is more of a

12:56.859 --> 12:59.362
cavern than a cave.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.863
Maud taught me that.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.115
Yeah OK.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.828
Here's what I'm thinking for

13:05.577 --> 13:07.828
her surprise party:

13:07.870 --> 13:09.830
edible rock candy plates,

13:07.870 --> 13:09.830
gem-shaped ice cubes,

13:09.872 --> 13:10.789
a pebble piñata...

13:11.916 --> 13:13.460
...uh, we'll skip that one.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.837
Might I make some

13:14.877 --> 13:16.837
suggestions?

13:16.879 --> 13:19.257
Oh, suggest away!

13:19.299 --> 13:20.841
That's why you're here.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.802
You and me,

13:20.883 --> 13:23.802
planning together.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.639
Friends.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.891
I have a vision board of

13:25.972 --> 13:28.891
everything Maud loves,

13:28.933 --> 13:31.519
and none of those

13:28.933 --> 13:31.519
things are on it.

13:31.561 --> 13:32.811
Hm.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.273
Let me see this "vision board."

13:35.315 --> 13:36.857
It's not a physical thing.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.277
I'm envisioning it.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.531
I enter through the large

13:40.737 --> 13:43.531
door of my mind palace

13:43.573 --> 13:45.866
and enter to the back where

13:43.573 --> 13:45.866
I have all of my books

13:45.908 --> 13:49.788
and possessions and what do I

13:45.908 --> 13:49.788
encounter, The Maud Room.

13:49.828 --> 13:52.873
None of those things are there.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.375
Just as I thought.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.127
Maud doesn't like surprises.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.422
Where does it say that?

13:59.464 --> 14:01.382
She never told me that!

14:01.424 --> 14:04.636
It sounds like she was

14:01.424 --> 14:04.636
protecting your feelings.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.429
She's very caring that way.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.890
Stop acting like you know

14:06.929 --> 14:09.890
my sister better than me!

14:09.932 --> 14:11.850
Technically, I never said that.

14:13.936 --> 14:17.898
Well, technically,

14:13.936 --> 14:17.898
I don't care!

14:17.940 --> 14:19.900
And since I've been best sister

14:17.940 --> 14:19.900
friends forever with Maud

14:19.942 --> 14:23.321
my entire life, I think

14:19.942 --> 14:23.321
<i>I'm</i> the expert here.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.700
Oh, but fine. If you don't

14:23.363 --> 14:26.700
believe me, let's ask her.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.909
But we have to be super sneaky!

14:28.951 --> 14:30.745
Can you be more specific?

14:30.787 --> 14:32.413
No!

14:32.455 --> 14:37.836
♪♪

14:37.877 --> 14:41.964
Huh! You must

14:37.877 --> 14:41.964
be Mudbriar!

14:42.006 --> 14:43.924
I'm Starlight Glimmer,

14:42.006 --> 14:43.924
nice to meet you!

14:43.966 --> 14:46.344
I've heard great things.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.390
I'm so glad the two of you

14:46.969 --> 14:50.390
are spending time together!

14:50.431 --> 14:52.933
So, how's it going?

14:54.060 --> 14:57.772
Mudbriar and I have just spent

14:54.060 --> 14:57.772
the best time bonding

14:57.814 --> 14:59.482
and we're really starting

14:57.814 --> 14:59.482
to make some headway

14:59.524 --> 15:01.942
becoming besties, except

14:59.524 --> 15:01.942
for one teensy weensy

15:01.984 --> 15:03.944
disagreement that maybe

15:01.984 --> 15:03.944
you could settle, Maud.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.946
See, Mudbriar here

15:03.986 --> 15:05.946
seems to think

15:05.988 --> 15:08.949
that you don't like

15:05.988 --> 15:08.949
surprise parties.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.910
Isn't it funny how

15:08.991 --> 15:10.910
<i>wrong</i> he is?

15:11.994 --> 15:13.663
I like surprise parties...

15:15.874 --> 15:17.751
because I know they

15:15.874 --> 15:17.751
make you happy

15:17.792 --> 15:18.918
when you throw

15:17.792 --> 15:18.918
them for me.

15:18.959 --> 15:20.461
See?

15:20.503 --> 15:21.962
Wait, what?

15:22.004 --> 15:25.341
I'd rather just do something

15:22.004 --> 15:25.341
small with you, Starlight,

15:25.383 --> 15:28.469
Boulder, and Mudbriar

15:25.383 --> 15:28.469
for my birthday.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.471
No party?

15:30.513 --> 15:32.098
No party?

15:32.599 --> 15:34.475
Did he put you

15:32.599 --> 15:34.475
up to this?

15:34.517 --> 15:35.935
Mm mm.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.978
Maybe you should

15:35.976 --> 15:37.978
consider, I don't know,

15:38.020 --> 15:40.523
taking things a little

15:38.020 --> 15:40.523
less serious with Mudbriar,

15:40.565 --> 15:42.525
because he's kinda, sorta...

15:42.567 --> 15:43.943
Impossible to like.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.655
Hey, Mudbriar!

15:47.697 --> 15:49.783
Have you ever flown a kite?

15:49.824 --> 15:50.991
Lemme tell you

15:49.824 --> 15:50.991
all about it, see,

15:51.033 --> 15:53.536
the first thing

15:51.033 --> 15:53.536
you should do is...

15:53.578 --> 15:55.663
I just can't believe you would

15:53.578 --> 15:55.663
choose sitting around with him

15:55.705 --> 15:57.957
over a party with

15:55.705 --> 15:57.957
your own sister.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.001
I didn't "choose" either of you.
