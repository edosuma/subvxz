Subtitles by explosiveskull

02:08.627 --> 02:10.229
Oh, shit.

02:12.631 --> 02:14.100
I bet you 100 I lose 'em.

02:43.528 --> 02:46.329
- That's 100 bucks you owe me.
- What?

02:46.331 --> 02:48.267
Your silence was your bet.
You know that, right?

02:51.170 --> 02:53.506
Shit.

03:00.512 --> 03:01.547
Step out of the car.

03:02.047 --> 03:03.150
Step out of the car!

03:04.317 --> 03:06.383
- Show me your hands. Hands!
- My hands are right here.

03:06.385 --> 03:08.452
- Step away!
- We on our way to the hosp...

03:08.454 --> 03:10.186
Listen to... Listen to me.

03:10.188 --> 03:12.023
- Stop resisting.
- Nobody's resisting you.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.958
Get out of the car.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.026
- Put your hands up and get out of the car.
- He can't!

03:16.028 --> 03:18.564
Why don't you open your eyes?
Go look at the tags.

03:19.064 --> 03:21.365
What you think's keepin' him
sitting there so pretty?

03:21.367 --> 03:23.366
There's a chair, Sarge.

03:23.368 --> 03:24.538
Good job, Columbo.

03:24.803 --> 03:26.336
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

03:26.338 --> 03:27.841
He's a quadriplegic.

03:28.206 --> 03:31.711
We on our way to the hospital.
The man is havin' a seizure.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.878
Oh, Christ.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.913
Y'all go ahead and take
your sweet time though.

03:36.915 --> 03:39.316
He's probably got a few minutes
before the rigoletto sets in.

03:39.318 --> 03:40.253
Rigor mortis.

03:40.853 --> 03:42.088
It's rigoletto.

03:42.587 --> 03:45.025
Quads are already paralyzed,
so it's a special term.

03:45.825 --> 03:47.691
Are y'all seriously
still standing there?

03:47.693 --> 03:48.729
Check him out.

03:55.767 --> 03:57.835
We got a problem, guys.

03:57.837 --> 03:59.502
You'll have a bigger problem if
I don't get him to the hospital.

03:59.504 --> 04:01.037
Call an ambulance.

04:01.039 --> 04:02.375
You think an ambulance
is faster than this car?

04:04.576 --> 04:06.746
Boom! Huh?

04:07.379 --> 04:08.381
Jesus.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.217
You really sold that one,
didn't you?

04:15.121 --> 04:16.185
"Rigoletto"?

04:26.731 --> 04:28.064
All right.
So, we radioed ahead.

04:28.066 --> 04:29.732
They're comin' out
with a gurney.

04:29.734 --> 04:30.970
- All right?
- Okay.

04:31.303 --> 04:32.602
He's gonna be fine.

04:32.604 --> 04:33.773
Appreciate you, man.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.215
What now?

05:03.936 --> 05:04.971
Just over there.

05:08.241 --> 05:09.676
Such a waste of time.

05:10.176 --> 05:11.243
All of this.

05:13.846 --> 05:15.282
What was I supposed to do?

05:16.448 --> 05:17.583
You couldn't breathe.

05:18.351 --> 05:21.922
Yvonne, I said
no extraordinary measures.

05:22.154 --> 05:24.024
Repeatedly.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.036
Where are the signatures?

05:37.036 --> 05:38.438
I've been looking, trust me.

05:38.703 --> 05:40.037
I'm not paid to trust you.

05:40.039 --> 05:41.440
Do you wanna
go back to prison?

05:42.041 --> 05:43.439
I didn't belong in prison.

05:43.441 --> 05:45.342
You need to prove
you're looking for work.

05:45.344 --> 05:46.279
I am.

05:46.712 --> 05:48.345
It's just that the leads
that the computer

05:48.347 --> 05:50.213
keeps choosin' for me,
they not for me.

05:50.215 --> 05:51.717
The computer don't know me.

05:52.351 --> 05:53.784
You don't know me.

05:53.786 --> 05:55.352
Well, I know you, Mr. Scott,

05:55.354 --> 05:57.453
and you need three signatures
by tomorrow,

05:57.455 --> 05:58.859
or you can tell it
to the judge.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.196
What does great
customer service mean to you?

06:05.198 --> 06:07.830
Doin' the right thing.
I don't know.

06:07.832 --> 06:10.301
Tell me about a time when you
worked hard to solve a problem.

06:10.303 --> 06:11.972
This morning, gettin' up.

06:13.505 --> 06:15.207
Do you even want to work here?

06:15.541 --> 06:16.672
I just need a signature.

06:56.251 --> 06:57.153
Don't give up.

07:02.924 --> 07:04.058
Like this?

07:04.060 --> 07:05.327
Yeah, that should do it.

07:06.262 --> 07:09.499
Why is my cook
and her husband doing this?

07:10.233 --> 07:13.670
Because you fired David.

07:15.171 --> 07:17.837
But we have some great resumes
for life auxiliaries,

07:17.839 --> 07:19.943
and we're gonna
find you someone.

07:20.209 --> 07:21.745
Someone you like.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.564
I have an interview
with a Mr. LaCasse.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.068
Same.

07:46.269 --> 07:47.370
The first elevator.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.238
I'll send it up for you.

07:57.313 --> 07:58.748
Wait, this thing goin' up?

08:00.248 --> 08:01.818
You here for the cleaning gig?

08:02.484 --> 08:04.287
Uh, life auxiliary.

08:05.287 --> 08:06.386
Life what?

08:06.388 --> 08:07.489
Auxiliary.

08:07.823 --> 08:11.058
That's what they
callin' it now?

08:11.060 --> 08:13.096
White people got a name
for everything.

08:13.462 --> 08:15.664
Penthouse?

08:18.967 --> 08:20.169
This is an apartment?

08:48.296 --> 08:49.164
Yo.

08:52.167 --> 08:53.535
Are you asking me
to move over?

08:53.835 --> 08:55.037
Except I'm not asking.

08:55.871 --> 08:56.839
Just move, man.

09:04.313 --> 09:06.483
Ain't this gig supposed to be
for the whole building?

09:07.116 --> 09:09.051
No, just for him, Mr. LaCasse.

09:13.121 --> 09:15.958
You gotta put on your Sunday
clothes just to push his broom?

09:21.697 --> 09:22.666
So...

09:23.698 --> 09:25.532
What would you
like to tell us?

09:25.534 --> 09:28.638
I take my relationship with
my clients very personally.

09:28.971 --> 09:30.704
And seriously, I mean...

09:30.706 --> 09:33.673
And professionally as well,
of course.

09:34.744 --> 09:36.379
I don't hear "disability."

09:36.812 --> 09:39.149
I hear "this ability."

09:40.882 --> 09:45.051
Let me be your hands
and your arms and your legs.

09:45.053 --> 09:48.388
Allow the space
where you begin and I end

09:48.390 --> 09:51.660
to be both infinite
and infinitesimal.

09:53.696 --> 09:55.265
I love that. You...

09:56.332 --> 09:57.200
All right.

09:57.533 --> 09:58.702
Your book changed me.

09:59.268 --> 10:02.439
So, I figured, even if
I don't get the position,

10:03.105 --> 10:04.574
I could get an autograph.

10:06.375 --> 10:07.844
How would you
get an autograph?

11:15.944 --> 11:17.945
It's sort of
an interesting thought.

11:17.947 --> 11:20.647
The chair is a metaphor
for energy.

11:20.649 --> 11:23.349
The way I look at it,
it's not what's been taken from you,

11:23.351 --> 11:25.786
it's what you've been given.

11:25.788 --> 11:28.689
I was with my previous client
for 18 years, so can't get rid of me.

11:28.691 --> 11:30.190
Well,
I have kids of my own.

11:30.192 --> 11:32.861
So, washing? Check.
Feeding? Check.

11:33.294 --> 11:34.994
Spills and accidents?
Check, check.

11:34.996 --> 11:36.330
I was a sociology major.

11:36.332 --> 11:38.699
I gotta go get my kid, man.

11:38.701 --> 11:40.670
You can't always tell by looking
at someone what's wrong with them.

11:43.304 --> 11:47.342
Now, tell me more about the previous...
Excuse me.

11:47.709 --> 11:50.210
- What are you doing?
- Oh, relax, it's not a holdup.

11:50.212 --> 11:53.379
I mean, even though you been holding
me up for damn near a hour out there.

11:53.381 --> 11:54.715
I gotta get to my kid, yo.

11:54.717 --> 11:56.016
You need to wait your turn.

11:56.018 --> 11:57.651
All I need is a John Hancock.

11:57.653 --> 11:59.289
Ain't gonna take you
but a second, lady.

11:59.989 --> 12:01.821
Are you delivering something?

12:01.823 --> 12:04.624
Yeah, employment papers.
I just gotta have somebody sign it.

12:04.626 --> 12:06.726
It's gotta be, like,
a manager or the owner.

12:06.728 --> 12:07.729
Is that you?

12:08.163 --> 12:10.066
Nah, it ain't you.
Is that you, boss?

12:10.665 --> 12:12.034
Yes.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.033
Fantastic, man.
Just sign this for me, please.

12:14.035 --> 12:15.571
How would I sign it?

12:17.972 --> 12:18.842
I don't know.

12:19.241 --> 12:20.076
Slowly?

12:22.977 --> 12:24.146
What? Don't your arms work?

12:25.079 --> 12:26.915
- They don't.
- Damn.

12:27.683 --> 12:28.815
What about you, sweetie?

12:28.817 --> 12:30.220
Why do you need a signature?

12:30.553 --> 12:33.323
I don't need a signature.
My PO needs a signature.

12:33.555 --> 12:35.989
As a matter of fact,

12:35.991 --> 12:37.760
you should put your number down here
just in case she wanna phone or check in.

12:38.059 --> 12:40.393
That way, it look like I did
what I said I was gonna do.

12:40.395 --> 12:43.196
And if she asks, just say an extremely
attractive candidate came in here,

12:43.198 --> 12:45.034
but y'all weren't lookin'
for a supermodel.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.402
I'm sorry, who might phone?

12:48.404 --> 12:49.570
My PO.

12:49.572 --> 12:51.607
- PO?
- His parole officer.

12:52.607 --> 12:53.842
What's that look about?

12:54.242 --> 12:55.777
Don't judge me.
I ain't judged you.

12:58.713 --> 13:00.949
Will you excuse us
for a moment, please?

13:02.183 --> 13:03.185
Thank you.

13:04.352 --> 13:06.856
- I gotta get to my kid, man.
- Why don't you have a seat?

13:07.389 --> 13:08.424
No, I'm good.

13:08.957 --> 13:10.923
So, you need a signature.
You don't need a job?

13:10.925 --> 13:12.124
I need both.

13:12.126 --> 13:13.395
Well, then have a seat.

13:14.462 --> 13:15.365
Please.

13:19.702 --> 13:21.768
Have you ever done
this kind of work before?

13:21.770 --> 13:24.640
I've done every kind of work
that you can do with a record.

13:24.939 --> 13:25.974
What were you in for?

13:28.209 --> 13:29.976
You're not allowed to ask me
that question in an interview.

13:29.978 --> 13:32.247
- Says?
- Says the constitution.

13:34.983 --> 13:37.149
As a matter of fact,

13:37.151 --> 13:38.820
now that you asked me that question,
you gotta offer me the job.

13:43.958 --> 13:44.827
Okay.

13:46.728 --> 13:47.597
"Okay"?

13:49.097 --> 13:51.565
Okay,
I'm offering you the position.

13:51.567 --> 13:54.401
What?
Philip, what are you doing?

13:54.403 --> 13:56.005
I'm offering him the position.

13:57.005 --> 13:58.808
So?

13:59.274 --> 14:00.943
I don't wanna be
your janitor, man.

14:01.943 --> 14:06.348
Janitor? No, no. We're...
We're hiring a life auxiliary.

14:06.749 --> 14:08.614
A what? What... What is that?

14:08.616 --> 14:10.783
He doesn't even know what
he's applying for, Philip.

14:10.785 --> 14:12.087
I need assistance.

14:12.954 --> 14:16.258
My arms don't work,
as you so astutely noted.

14:16.692 --> 14:17.794
Nor do my legs.

14:18.994 --> 14:20.430
I can only move my neck.

14:21.362 --> 14:22.799
You can move your mouth.

14:23.631 --> 14:24.766
As can you.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.367
So, what's that mean?
I gotta...

14:27.369 --> 14:28.935
I gotta carry you around
or somethin'?

14:28.937 --> 14:30.936
You'd have to transfer me
to the chair,

14:30.938 --> 14:33.108
to my bed, to the car.

14:33.641 --> 14:35.841
There would be some travel,
if that interests you.

14:35.843 --> 14:36.813
It don't.

14:37.346 --> 14:38.711
Travel enough as it is.

14:38.713 --> 14:40.349
It took me a hour
just to get here.

14:42.451 --> 14:43.319
Uh-huh.

14:44.218 --> 14:45.554
Okay. Uh...

14:46.054 --> 14:48.524
Look, I think your plantation
is bananas.

14:48.957 --> 14:50.956
But unfortunately, I don't
wanna be nobody's servant.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.192
So, how 'bout you just
sign my paperwork,

14:53.194 --> 14:54.994
and I'll think about
your offer, okay?

14:54.996 --> 14:56.729
Well, we can't sign papers

14:56.731 --> 14:58.398
saying that you're looking
for work

14:58.400 --> 15:00.903
if you're going to turn down
the work I offered.

15:01.370 --> 15:03.840
All right, I know you can't,
but how about your boo?

15:05.140 --> 15:06.009
My boo?

15:08.744 --> 15:12.415
- Yvonne is not my... my boo.
- No.

15:12.847 --> 15:14.314
Are you, Yvonne?
Are you my boo?

15:14.316 --> 15:15.548
- No, I'm not your boo.
- No.

15:15.550 --> 15:17.183
All right. So listen,

15:17.185 --> 15:18.820
why don't you take the night
and think it over?

15:19.520 --> 15:21.690
Come back tomorrow morning
ready for work,

15:22.491 --> 15:23.889
or we'll sign the papers.

15:26.095 --> 15:27.397
I won't show you out.

15:27.696 --> 15:28.564
Yeah.

15:28.896 --> 15:29.931
Don't you get up.

15:36.904 --> 15:37.774
Philip.

15:38.273 --> 15:39.538
Why are you doing this?

15:39.540 --> 15:41.108
Because it's what I want.

15:41.110 --> 15:42.508
If you don't like
the candidates

15:42.510 --> 15:43.777
that we've found already,

15:43.779 --> 15:45.378
then let's just keep looking.

15:45.380 --> 15:47.214
I would be happy to assist

15:47.216 --> 15:49.619
- in finding the perfect...
- No, I don't want your assistance.

15:50.419 --> 15:52.219
You're a businesswoman,
not a nurse.

15:52.221 --> 15:53.389
I know what I am.

15:54.255 --> 15:55.254
I know.

15:55.256 --> 15:57.025
I know that you do.

15:57.726 --> 16:00.527
But I hired you to manage
my affairs, not to...

16:00.529 --> 16:02.030
Rush you to the hospital?

16:02.364 --> 16:04.634
That's what this is about,
isn't it?

16:04.933 --> 16:06.936
You shouldn't have been
put in that position.

16:21.150 --> 16:23.385
Hey. Anthony Scott.

16:23.952 --> 16:25.254
His mother picked him up.

16:25.621 --> 16:26.755
Damn, man.

16:47.943 --> 16:49.511
I said I'd pick Anthony up.

16:56.751 --> 16:58.250
You say a lot of things, Dell,

16:58.252 --> 17:00.021
but I ain't
heard from you in days.

17:01.255 --> 17:02.491
- Hey.
- Come on.

17:10.265 --> 17:11.299
What's up, man?

17:23.544 --> 17:25.013
Your mom
still making you do that?

17:27.549 --> 17:28.617
I got you somethin'.

17:37.726 --> 17:38.794
It's for your birthday.

17:42.864 --> 17:44.166
Which birthday?

17:49.338 --> 17:50.373
I deserve that.

17:51.873 --> 17:52.909
I hear you.

17:54.075 --> 17:56.077
But, I mean, it's still a gift, man.
What do you say?

18:01.515 --> 18:02.384
Anthony.

18:03.685 --> 18:04.854
I'm talking to you.

18:05.653 --> 18:06.521
Anthony.

18:20.502 --> 18:21.404
What are you doin'?

18:22.070 --> 18:24.073
Sitting on the couch, Latrice.

18:24.840 --> 18:27.940
Don't think you stayin' here.

18:27.942 --> 18:30.109
It's for one night, I just got
kicked out my place...

18:30.111 --> 18:31.410
No.

18:31.412 --> 18:32.946
- Latrice...
- Dell, go look for work,

18:32.948 --> 18:34.580
or do whatever the hell it is
that you do.

18:34.582 --> 18:36.518
Okay. So, you're in
one of your moods, I see.

18:38.253 --> 18:39.722
- Listen...
- You know what, Dell?

18:40.221 --> 18:41.089
Get out.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.523
- What?
- Get out.

18:43.525 --> 18:45.926
How you gonna kick me out when I'm
the one who found you the place?

18:45.928 --> 18:47.597
Yeah, and look at it.

18:47.862 --> 18:51.097
This place, I pay for. Not you.

18:51.099 --> 18:55.702
You owe me...
us so much child support

18:55.704 --> 18:57.404
that the other thing
that you owe us

18:57.406 --> 18:59.775
is a thank you
for not reportin' you.

19:00.708 --> 19:02.410
I am done, Dell.

19:03.378 --> 19:05.081
I can't. Out.

19:05.546 --> 19:07.382
I don't wanna see you
and neither do Anthony.

19:07.783 --> 19:10.215
That boy needs me.
He needs me to protect him,

19:10.217 --> 19:12.718
because people around here
eat boys like that for lunch.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.888
How you gonna protect him
if you ain't never here?

19:14.890 --> 19:16.723
You're asking me to leave.

19:16.725 --> 19:19.594
- Because I can't count on you.
- What do you want from me?

19:20.294 --> 19:21.162
Hmm?

19:22.797 --> 19:23.832
Now?

19:25.233 --> 19:26.269
Nothin'.

19:27.235 --> 19:28.838
What did I want from you?

19:31.739 --> 19:32.775
Everything.

19:33.809 --> 19:35.942
Help, support.

19:35.944 --> 19:37.811
- I support you, Latrice.
- How?

19:37.813 --> 19:39.415
- What do you mean, "How?"
- Where?

19:40.482 --> 19:42.749
You never look out
for nobody but you, Dell.

19:42.751 --> 19:44.751
- That's not true.
- So, you take a good look at this

19:44.753 --> 19:46.852
falling apartment
you found us,

19:46.854 --> 19:51.157
and on your way out, you look at
that child I have raised by myself.

19:51.159 --> 19:54.130
You know what? You take a good,
hard look at these things,

19:54.496 --> 19:57.033
- because you ain't gonna see 'em again.
- Yo, why don't you...

19:59.801 --> 20:01.037
Goodbye, Dell.

20:02.504 --> 20:03.639
You serious right now?

20:08.543 --> 20:09.611
Cool.

20:28.397 --> 20:29.966
Need a place to stay, yo?

20:31.132 --> 20:33.001
- Nah, I'm good.
- Yeah.

20:33.467 --> 20:35.036
Should get back
in the game, man.

20:35.403 --> 20:36.471
I could use you.

20:37.371 --> 20:38.407
Easy money.

20:40.508 --> 20:41.544
Nah, man.

20:42.710 --> 20:44.045
It was never easy.

21:25.620 --> 21:26.522
Jenny.

21:31.459 --> 21:32.361
Jenny.

21:33.294 --> 21:34.226
Philip.

22:11.499 --> 22:12.667
Good morning, Mr. Scott.

22:13.067 --> 22:14.102
Ain't it?

22:15.603 --> 22:16.905
I can sign your paperwork.

22:17.639 --> 22:19.308
There's no need.
I'mma take the gig.

22:20.609 --> 22:22.912
Wouldn't it be better
if I just signed your papers?

22:23.611 --> 22:25.512
You are not qualified
for this position.

22:25.514 --> 22:26.980
You have never done it before.

22:26.982 --> 22:28.484
Look, does he want me or not?

22:31.686 --> 22:33.589
Yes, he does.

22:33.822 --> 22:34.857
All right, so good.

22:36.158 --> 22:37.193
How much does it pay?

22:42.964 --> 22:43.862
That a month?

22:43.864 --> 22:44.933
Per week.

22:50.104 --> 22:51.670
All right.
Well, I can live with that.

22:51.672 --> 22:53.305
If you throw in a MetroCard.

22:53.307 --> 22:54.275
Unlimited.

22:54.508 --> 22:56.109
A MetroCard?

22:56.111 --> 22:57.543
I gotta get here, don't I?

22:57.545 --> 23:00.315
Mr. Scott,
this is a live-in position.

23:52.033 --> 23:52.932
Mr. Scott.

23:58.939 --> 24:00.208
Mr. Scott.

24:12.786 --> 24:16.121
This monitor travels
with you at all times.

24:16.123 --> 24:20.295
You need to be available
to Mr. LaCasse 24/7.

24:22.796 --> 24:24.098
Do you have any questions?

24:24.565 --> 24:26.568
Um... Yeah. Why you so angry?

24:27.936 --> 24:29.271
You'll know when I'm angry.

24:29.771 --> 24:30.639
I scare you?

24:31.605 --> 24:32.605
Yes.

24:32.607 --> 24:34.376
Yes, you do, Mr. Scott.

24:35.409 --> 24:37.313
But not for the reasons
you're implying.

24:38.079 --> 24:40.883
As powerful
as Mr. LaCasse is...

24:41.916 --> 24:43.452
he's a vulnerable man.

24:44.151 --> 24:47.323
So, does it scare me to think of him
in the wrong hands? Yes, it does.

24:47.889 --> 24:50.622
Well, he don't seem to think these
the wrong hands. He picked 'em.

24:50.624 --> 24:51.957
And why do you think
he picked you?

24:51.959 --> 24:53.461
Because I'm
the best candidate.

24:54.329 --> 24:56.165
Because you were
the worst candidate.

24:56.997 --> 24:58.467
By far.

24:58.766 --> 25:00.265
Let's just call this what it is.
It's a game.

25:00.267 --> 25:01.801
In this game,
you get three strikes.

25:01.803 --> 25:03.339
That's the agreement
I made with him.

25:03.671 --> 25:04.773
You know baseball?

25:05.239 --> 25:07.476
- I do.
- So you my referee?

25:08.075 --> 25:08.910
Umpire.

25:09.511 --> 25:10.512
Just testing you.

25:11.579 --> 25:12.848
Yes, you are.

25:35.003 --> 25:38.170
Mr. LaCasse needs
to be transferred to his chair

25:38.172 --> 25:39.107
for breakfast.

25:40.140 --> 25:42.111
- Do you want me to go pick him up?
- Yes.

25:42.444 --> 25:43.646
Yes, pick him up.

26:19.246 --> 26:20.882
The buckle! Buckle!

26:27.389 --> 26:28.823
You need to buckle him.

26:29.657 --> 26:33.696
This needs to be strapped
at all times.

26:42.336 --> 26:43.938
And now
you feed him breakfast.

26:44.272 --> 26:45.341
Can you do that?

26:46.173 --> 26:47.241
Yeah.

26:47.542 --> 26:50.243
Philip, I need
to call the gallery.

26:50.245 --> 26:51.447
Are you sure you're good?

26:51.880 --> 26:53.215
Yvonne, I'm fine.

26:57.619 --> 26:59.785
Alexa, lower music.

27:01.890 --> 27:02.757
What's he sayin'?

27:03.190 --> 27:04.459
"Nessun dorma."

27:05.627 --> 27:07.793
"No one's sleeping."

27:07.795 --> 27:10.032
Well, how can they
when he's shoutin' about it?

27:10.631 --> 27:12.567
You blast that shit
just to annoy people?

27:12.967 --> 27:15.267
Is that why you hired me?
To piss that white lady off?

27:15.269 --> 27:16.304
Yvonne?

27:17.104 --> 27:17.972
No.

27:18.605 --> 27:19.907
Then why'd you hire me?

27:23.410 --> 27:24.479
Can I eat now?

27:30.552 --> 27:31.587
What is this, uh...

27:31.986 --> 27:34.622
- Is this orange?
- Uh, it is a kumquat.

27:35.489 --> 27:37.226
- A kumquat.
- Mmm.

27:46.066 --> 27:47.468
My fault.

27:53.006 --> 27:54.243
- Another one?
- Mmm.

28:07.121 --> 28:08.623
You know
I can feel that, right?

28:15.929 --> 28:17.597
God...

28:17.599 --> 28:18.467
Okay.

28:22.336 --> 28:23.337
No.

28:23.705 --> 28:26.775
No. No, I need...
I need to rest a moment.

28:35.449 --> 28:37.652
Have you ever
taken care of anybody?

28:38.852 --> 28:39.688
Yup.

28:40.287 --> 28:41.323
Myself.

28:43.157 --> 28:44.793
Hey, hey, hey, careful.

28:45.392 --> 28:48.628
It's a mobile. Doesn't that mean "move"?
Ain't that the point of it?

28:48.630 --> 28:49.731
No, it...

28:51.298 --> 28:53.201
- Yes, but it...
- It's expensive?

28:53.735 --> 28:54.636
It is.

28:56.204 --> 28:57.473
You as rich as Jay-Z?

28:58.840 --> 28:59.707
No.

29:00.408 --> 29:01.310
Richer.

29:01.909 --> 29:02.878
Jeez.

29:03.878 --> 29:05.477
Money doesn't
buy you everything.

29:11.419 --> 29:13.054
Hey, look like it does to me.

29:14.054 --> 29:15.990
Nissan Doorman now, baby.

29:16.757 --> 29:18.390
- I'm Dell.
- Maggie.

29:18.392 --> 29:19.428
The PT.

29:19.994 --> 29:21.429
More like the PYT.

29:22.330 --> 29:24.433
Your wife okay with Victoria's
Secret dressing you?

29:26.434 --> 29:27.336
I'm not married.

29:30.004 --> 29:31.073
You have a ring on.

29:32.340 --> 29:33.375
My wife died.

29:36.410 --> 29:37.578
Shall we get started?

29:41.282 --> 29:43.585
Each arm,
full range of motion.

29:44.686 --> 29:46.188
Always both sides.

29:46.521 --> 29:48.588
Any questions?

29:48.590 --> 29:50.523
Yeah. Have you thought about how
you're gonna tell your boyfriend

29:50.525 --> 29:51.627
you met someone else?

29:53.361 --> 29:56.130
I'll show you how to get
Mr. LaCasse ready for the day.

29:56.730 --> 29:58.196
If you're not too busy.

29:58.198 --> 30:00.401
No, me and Mags got this.

30:01.436 --> 30:03.071
Get to show her
my sensitive side.

30:03.537 --> 30:05.606
It's best viewed unclothed
and from behind...

30:06.975 --> 30:08.043
by candlelight.

30:08.976 --> 30:10.545
Have you ever
changed a catheter?

30:12.813 --> 30:13.814
Nah.

30:14.381 --> 30:15.417
It's not hard.

30:16.249 --> 30:17.716
It better not be.

30:17.718 --> 30:19.921
Oh. Sorry,
this is your sensitive side?

30:24.292 --> 30:26.328
You just slowly...

30:26.893 --> 30:28.130
Ooh!

30:28.496 --> 30:29.965
- ...pull it out.
- Ooh!

30:31.298 --> 30:32.263
Oh...

30:32.265 --> 30:33.302
And the new one...

30:33.935 --> 30:35.467
Oh, man.

30:35.469 --> 30:36.904
...goes right back in.

30:37.839 --> 30:39.408
You pinch the head...

30:40.073 --> 30:42.007
...and insert.

30:43.678 --> 30:46.515
Then you feed it in.

30:47.515 --> 30:48.650
I can't feel it.

30:49.583 --> 30:50.619
Well, I can.

30:50.951 --> 30:52.787
Oh!

30:53.621 --> 30:56.358
If you can't handle this,
how are you going to...

31:00.328 --> 31:01.363
What's that?

31:02.463 --> 31:03.632
What is that supposed to be?

31:03.864 --> 31:04.832
You'll see.

31:05.967 --> 31:07.002
That's your finger?

31:08.169 --> 31:09.036
What, you...

31:10.871 --> 31:12.173
Oh, I'm not doin' that.

31:13.574 --> 31:15.876
Yeah, that's not... That's not...
That's... No. There's no way. So...

31:16.777 --> 31:19.477
I'm not put... I'm not puttin'
my finger in nobody's butt.

31:19.479 --> 31:21.647
I'm not puttin' a straw
in that man's drink

31:21.649 --> 31:23.148
and I'm not
unpackin' his luggage.

31:23.150 --> 31:24.385
Well, talk to Yvonne.

31:24.986 --> 31:25.887
About what?

31:26.454 --> 31:28.056
About me not
emptying his dump truck.

31:28.389 --> 31:29.821
Dump truck?

31:29.823 --> 31:31.456
He's talking about
the bowel program.

31:31.458 --> 31:33.658
Oh.
Well, it's part of the job.

31:33.660 --> 31:35.127
It's not part of my job.

31:35.129 --> 31:36.861
That's not what
a life oxillary does.

31:36.863 --> 31:38.630
It's what
a life auxiliary does.

31:38.632 --> 31:40.201
Well, not this life auxiliary.

31:41.669 --> 31:43.369
Strike one, Mr. Scott.

31:43.371 --> 31:45.804
No. No, that's not a strike.
That's a check swing.

31:45.806 --> 31:48.073
No, you broke the plane.

31:48.075 --> 31:50.242
Okay, so you the plate ump? Don't
you gotta talk to the third base ump?

31:50.244 --> 31:52.047
I'm every umpire. Strike one.

31:57.884 --> 31:59.420
Do you know about the DNR?

32:00.220 --> 32:01.088
D and what?

32:01.555 --> 32:04.092
DNR. Do not resuscitate.

32:05.927 --> 32:07.928
It's something
you'll have to agree to.

32:08.361 --> 32:09.398
As my carer.

32:10.098 --> 32:11.533
Do you understand
what that means?

32:13.034 --> 32:14.766
Like, I don't have
to give you mouth-to-mouth

32:14.768 --> 32:16.270
if you're chokin'
on your kumquat?

32:17.572 --> 32:20.207
No extraordinary measures
if I stop breathing.

32:20.908 --> 32:21.776
Nothing.

32:23.111 --> 32:24.545
I'm good with nothing, man.

32:32.186 --> 32:34.222
So, you don't want to be here
no more, is that it?

32:36.556 --> 32:39.358
Wait, is that why you hired me
instead of those other guys?

32:39.360 --> 32:41.263
'Cause you thought
that I would DNR your ass?

32:44.031 --> 32:45.634
I'll take my lunch in my room.

32:46.934 --> 32:47.969
Tell Charlotte.

34:19.826 --> 34:21.027
What?

34:25.166 --> 34:26.400
I was paging you.

34:34.742 --> 34:36.478
This is his lifeline.

34:37.210 --> 34:38.646
Strike two.

34:39.313 --> 34:40.815
You can't call that a strike.

34:41.649 --> 34:43.217
I can hear it. I see it.

34:43.650 --> 34:44.686
Strike two.

34:45.518 --> 34:46.353
Let's go.

34:46.753 --> 34:47.822
Now.

34:48.688 --> 34:50.192
Can I at least take a shower?

35:11.544 --> 35:12.581
Yeah.

35:36.970 --> 35:38.039
Yeah.

35:40.573 --> 35:42.943
Stop! Stop!

35:52.052 --> 35:53.153
Yvonne.

35:54.454 --> 35:55.556
Yvonne!

35:57.157 --> 35:58.058
Hey!

36:05.900 --> 36:07.635
Alexa, stop!

36:09.403 --> 36:10.472
- Hey.
- What?

36:10.838 --> 36:12.070
I'll get the shower ready.

36:12.072 --> 36:13.775
- I want that on.
- No, man.

36:14.140 --> 36:16.108
Look, I get you trying
to block out the world,

36:16.110 --> 36:17.742
but can you at least do it
to better music?

36:17.744 --> 36:19.346
Have you ever
listened to opera?

36:19.680 --> 36:21.850
Yeah.
Opera's really big in prison.

36:22.115 --> 36:23.818
You can hardly get a seat
on opera night.

36:25.251 --> 36:27.785
Why can't we listen to Aretha?
Hmm?

36:27.787 --> 36:29.088
You wanna feed your soul?

36:29.090 --> 36:30.358
Then listen to its queen.

36:30.858 --> 36:32.494
Think about it. Yeah.

36:33.093 --> 36:34.762
♪ You better think, think ♪

36:35.095 --> 36:37.363
♪ Think about what
You're trying to do to me ♪

36:37.365 --> 36:39.034
♪ Think, think ♪

36:39.967 --> 36:41.033
It's amazing, ain't it?

36:41.035 --> 36:42.166
I sound just like her.

36:42.168 --> 36:43.704
Yeah.

36:44.137 --> 36:47.007
When I close my eyes,
which I needed to, it's uncanny.

36:47.474 --> 36:48.842
It's like identity theft.

36:50.878 --> 36:52.814
- Eyes. Eye... Eyes.
- Hmm?

36:54.381 --> 36:55.617
Okay, okay.

36:55.983 --> 36:56.985
All right.

36:57.818 --> 36:59.153
That wasn't too bad, right?

37:00.287 --> 37:03.021
Okay. Okay.

37:03.023 --> 37:04.525
You're waterboarding me.

37:10.197 --> 37:11.963
Uh... Yes file.

37:11.965 --> 37:13.798
You just gonna
give 'em $10,000?

37:13.800 --> 37:14.969
It's a nonprofit.

37:16.470 --> 37:18.206
I ain't seen a profit
in a while either.

37:21.307 --> 37:23.143
No, no. That's personal.

37:27.213 --> 37:29.851
- Hmm. Persistent.
- Throw it away.

37:30.651 --> 37:32.854
You don't even want to reply?
For closure?

37:37.657 --> 37:40.060
You have to be at the gallery
at 11:00.

37:44.731 --> 37:45.733
That would be a no.

37:47.367 --> 37:48.436
Worth a shot.

37:50.236 --> 37:52.773
So, this how you made all your dough?
From writing this stuff?

37:53.073 --> 37:56.744
No. I specialized in turning
around failing companies.

37:57.610 --> 37:58.946
Invested in start-ups.

37:59.613 --> 38:01.182
Oh. Okay.

38:02.515 --> 38:04.682
So, let's say that I wanted
to start my own company

38:04.684 --> 38:06.286
that you was gonna
buy for a million.

38:07.053 --> 38:08.889
I'd say, "What is your idea?"

38:10.023 --> 38:10.924
I don't know.

38:12.226 --> 38:14.294
What are you passionate about?

38:15.796 --> 38:17.465
Women, sleeping.

38:18.032 --> 38:19.434
Sleeping with women.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.633
Little difficult to monetize.

38:21.635 --> 38:23.604
I got some friends
that'd disagree with you.

38:24.438 --> 38:27.108
Well, be that as it may,

38:27.807 --> 38:29.975
I suggest you find a need
and fill it.

38:29.977 --> 38:31.312
Philip LaCasse!

38:31.711 --> 38:33.077
How are you?

38:33.079 --> 38:34.915
- God.
- Out and about.

38:35.715 --> 38:36.750
Good for you.

38:37.418 --> 38:39.718
I've been meaning to tell you,
we have found

38:39.720 --> 38:41.820
the most wonderful carer
for my mother.

38:41.822 --> 38:43.425
I'll get you the number
of the agency.

38:43.657 --> 38:45.392
Hello.

38:45.825 --> 38:47.459
I'm right here. I'm caring.

38:47.461 --> 38:50.165
- Carter, this is Mr....
- Blackman.

38:50.930 --> 38:53.168
Daekwandashay Blackman.

38:54.802 --> 38:57.104
This is Carter Locke.
He lives below us.

38:57.570 --> 38:58.736
Oh, he's living in?

38:58.738 --> 38:59.941
Yes, he is.

39:00.608 --> 39:02.240
I, uh, won't shake your hand.

39:02.242 --> 39:03.410
It's probably best.

39:03.977 --> 39:06.577
- Come on, P, we gotta bounce.
- We are bouncing, Carter.

39:06.579 --> 39:07.681
All right.

39:08.282 --> 39:09.684
That your friend?

39:09.983 --> 39:12.086
Get to know me, Daekwandashay.

39:12.753 --> 39:13.986
Which car is yours?

39:13.988 --> 39:15.423
All of these to the right.

39:17.691 --> 39:18.626
All of these?

39:19.126 --> 39:20.961
Yes,
but we're selling them.

39:21.262 --> 39:22.664
Oh, my God.

39:23.030 --> 39:24.666
We use this van now.

39:25.331 --> 39:27.768
I'm not puttin' you in no paddy
wagon unless you're drunk.

39:28.168 --> 39:31.538
- You drunk?
- Just on your positive attitude.

39:32.106 --> 39:33.207
You want positive?

39:33.773 --> 39:35.943
Then I'm not puttin' you
in no big-ass negative.

39:36.677 --> 39:38.042
God. Damn.

39:38.044 --> 39:39.646
They're not practical.

39:40.046 --> 39:41.946
Exactly.

39:46.352 --> 39:47.956
Whoo!

39:50.191 --> 39:52.560
Oh, Go...
You cannot sell this car, man.

39:53.494 --> 39:54.361
Oh!

39:59.066 --> 40:00.235
The missing piece.

40:01.702 --> 40:03.171
- You found it.
- Hmm.

40:05.238 --> 40:06.140
How much?

40:06.539 --> 40:08.707
Seventy-five. Firm, I believe.

40:08.709 --> 40:10.145
- I can check.
- Would you?

40:13.514 --> 40:15.682
For 75 G's,
I could paint you a square.

40:16.182 --> 40:18.085
I'll throw in some rectangles
too, if you want.

40:20.253 --> 40:21.688
Haven't you already
got this one?

40:21.988 --> 40:24.025
It's part of a series
my wife loved.

40:24.525 --> 40:25.923
Yeah,
but it's the same painting.

40:25.925 --> 40:28.428
Sorry, it's 80,000.

40:29.430 --> 40:30.331
Hmm.

40:31.731 --> 40:32.599
I'll take it.

40:35.602 --> 40:37.171
Eighty thousand dollars.

40:37.503 --> 40:39.271
Do you know what I could do
with $80,000?

40:39.273 --> 40:40.939
Who I could do with $80,000?

40:40.941 --> 40:44.712
Okay, but how do you put
a price on a creative work?

40:46.180 --> 40:48.416
You pay to show
it has a value to you.

40:48.715 --> 40:51.418
I own a collection
of first edition novels.

40:51.751 --> 40:53.253
Books I read as a child.

40:54.887 --> 40:56.123
Signed by the authors.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.427
That was a gift from my wife.

41:00.427 --> 41:02.463
One for each year
that we were together.

41:04.097 --> 41:05.933
How much
would I pay for those?

41:07.568 --> 41:08.570
I...

41:09.369 --> 41:10.604
I really couldn't say.

41:25.452 --> 41:26.321
What?

41:26.619 --> 41:27.487
What?

41:47.307 --> 41:49.608
Ain't gonna get me
back in there.

41:49.610 --> 41:51.443
I gotta get
out of here. I already...

41:51.445 --> 41:52.613
Yo, Latrice.

41:54.648 --> 41:55.916
Mmm.

41:56.416 --> 41:58.182
- Yeah, all right.
- You okay?

41:58.184 --> 42:00.354
- It's all right. I'll see y'all later.
- All right.

42:01.088 --> 42:02.657
- Okay, girl.
- What's up?

42:03.756 --> 42:04.825
Whose car is this?

42:05.425 --> 42:06.628
It's my boss's.

42:08.294 --> 42:10.331
- And your boss is?
- Rich.

42:10.631 --> 42:13.334
Hey, I wanna see Anthony.

42:13.967 --> 42:16.704
Before you say anything,
Latrice, I'm working, okay?

42:17.604 --> 42:18.640
Here.

42:19.606 --> 42:21.342
My first paycheck,
signed over to you.

42:26.780 --> 42:28.312
What you doing?

42:28.314 --> 42:30.548
Guy I work for, he can't move,
so I gotta...

42:30.550 --> 42:33.387
- I gotta help him get around.
- And you make this much?

42:33.686 --> 42:34.653
Yeah.

42:34.655 --> 42:35.689
It's a good gig.

42:36.889 --> 42:38.523
Hope you can hang on to it.

42:38.525 --> 42:40.461
Course I can hang on to it.

42:42.996 --> 42:43.965
How's he doing?

42:44.664 --> 42:45.699
He's good.

42:46.233 --> 42:48.736
Just got his report card.
All A's.

42:49.669 --> 42:51.838
Apple don't fall far
from the tree.

42:53.374 --> 42:54.676
You the tree in this story.

42:58.345 --> 42:59.547
Do you think, uh...

43:00.347 --> 43:02.650
You think maybe you could
tell him something for me?

43:06.253 --> 43:08.389
The book that I gave him,
I need to get it back.

43:09.423 --> 43:10.325
Why?

43:12.258 --> 43:13.927
- 'Cause it...
- Wasn't yours to give.

43:15.361 --> 43:16.695
Trice, listen to me.

43:16.697 --> 43:20.097
Honey, you gave
your son a gift

43:20.099 --> 43:21.368
and now you want it back?

43:22.936 --> 43:25.707
You pry it out his hands.
I ain't doin' your dirty work.

43:39.419 --> 43:41.088
Yeah, that was so awesome...

43:57.104 --> 43:59.104
So, you're doing good
in school, huh?

43:59.106 --> 44:00.041
I hear about you.

44:05.445 --> 44:07.581
Yo, what you doing
with my kid, man?

44:08.048 --> 44:09.082
Shaking his hand.

44:09.416 --> 44:10.785
What? I can't shake his hand?

44:12.418 --> 44:13.453
Hey, Anthony!

44:15.655 --> 44:16.724
Yo. Yo, yo.

44:17.624 --> 44:18.990
What you got going on, man?

44:18.992 --> 44:21.062
- Ooh! Man, you see that...
- Yo!

44:21.561 --> 44:22.596
Get off!

44:23.162 --> 44:24.428
Get off the car!

44:27.601 --> 44:29.003
Go ahead.
I'll watch it for you.

44:55.128 --> 44:56.164
Where have you been?

44:57.930 --> 44:59.133
I had to run a errand.

45:02.668 --> 45:04.271
- Strike three.
- What?

45:04.771 --> 45:06.671
Come on. No, no.
That was a foul tip.

45:06.673 --> 45:07.775
Which I caught.

45:08.207 --> 45:10.544
- So, now you're out.
- Look, Yvonne, please.

45:11.144 --> 45:13.278
I'm serious, man.
Like, don't do this, okay?

45:13.280 --> 45:15.680
I had to go take my check down
to my ex. I didn't have time

45:15.682 --> 45:17.816
- to come back up...
- Who said you could take the car?

45:17.818 --> 45:18.852
I did.

45:25.492 --> 45:26.360
Okay.

45:34.501 --> 45:35.369
Thanks.

45:36.403 --> 45:37.305
Hmm.

46:22.081 --> 46:22.949
Philip?

46:24.517 --> 46:25.352
Philip?

46:25.852 --> 46:26.751
Philip!

46:28.588 --> 46:30.525
Tell me what to do.
What you want me to do?

46:31.592 --> 46:32.593
Shit.

46:33.126 --> 46:34.061
Come on, man.

46:34.360 --> 46:35.362
Is it air? It's air?

46:37.764 --> 46:38.966
Hold on, hold on.

46:39.900 --> 46:41.700
Here. Here, breathe.

46:41.702 --> 46:44.238
Take... Breathe.

46:47.541 --> 46:49.410
What?
So, you not gonna breathe?

46:50.276 --> 46:51.646
Huh? P!

46:52.044 --> 46:54.215
Ain't nothing extraordinary
about breathing, man.

46:55.715 --> 46:57.649
P, you know damn well
I need this gig.

46:57.651 --> 46:59.117
So, you take a deep breath

46:59.119 --> 47:00.588
or I am gonna give you
mouth-to-mouth.

47:08.894 --> 47:09.930
Here. Here, here.

47:21.307 --> 47:22.342
That happen a lot?

47:25.912 --> 47:28.616
You okay, man? I mean,
does something else hurt?

47:29.515 --> 47:30.584
It's my legs.

47:31.985 --> 47:33.086
It's the nerves.

47:35.988 --> 47:37.992
It's called
neurogenic pain. It's...

47:39.459 --> 47:40.928
It's like being on fire.

47:43.296 --> 47:44.865
They don't give you
nothing for that?

47:47.300 --> 47:48.669
Different medications.

47:50.503 --> 47:51.671
It helps a bit.

47:54.106 --> 47:54.976
Not enough.

47:57.010 --> 47:58.979
Hurt enough to make you
wanna off yourself?

48:00.479 --> 48:01.349
No.

48:03.150 --> 48:04.885
But losing my wife does.

48:15.461 --> 48:16.496
I'mma help you.

48:48.762 --> 48:50.030
It's not gonna help.

48:52.698 --> 48:54.034
Tell me after you try it.

49:10.450 --> 49:11.919
So, how did the, uh...

49:13.285 --> 49:14.755
How did the accident happen?

49:15.956 --> 49:17.091
Paragliding.

49:17.624 --> 49:19.593
No, no. I know that.
I'm saying...

49:20.894 --> 49:22.530
I'm saying how. Like...

49:24.463 --> 49:25.632
How did it happen?

49:28.934 --> 49:29.969
Bad judgment.

49:30.704 --> 49:31.572
Mine.

49:33.405 --> 49:36.142
There was some rough weather.

49:38.144 --> 49:39.380
We never should've...

49:41.148 --> 49:42.149
But...

49:43.115 --> 49:44.918
I've always had a, or had,

49:46.285 --> 49:48.255
a taste for
pushing the envelope.

49:50.256 --> 49:52.459
Who paraglides in the storm?

49:53.760 --> 49:54.794
Lightning.

49:55.294 --> 49:56.664
What should we do?

49:57.731 --> 50:00.434
I know. Let's go paragliding.

50:04.436 --> 50:06.406
I woke up.

50:08.175 --> 50:09.243
There was Jenny.

50:12.012 --> 50:13.147
My poor wife.

50:18.684 --> 50:20.086
And I remember thinking...

50:23.023 --> 50:24.325
"Well, honey...

50:25.825 --> 50:27.762
this should take your mind
off the cancer."

50:30.162 --> 50:31.197
Cancer. She...

50:33.332 --> 50:34.367
She had cancer.

50:35.836 --> 50:37.303
And, uh, I...

50:38.972 --> 50:40.006
I...

50:45.378 --> 50:46.613
Ah, sorry.

50:49.148 --> 50:50.817
It's nothing
to be sorry about.

50:52.985 --> 50:54.454
I spend a lot of mornings...

50:55.956 --> 50:57.525
before anyone else is up...

51:00.693 --> 51:04.398
before my day is a jumble
of other people's hands...

51:05.831 --> 51:07.200
and I'm still flying...

51:10.470 --> 51:12.406
Oh, God, it took me so high.

51:15.842 --> 51:17.378
And then it took it all away.

51:22.215 --> 51:24.251
But nothing compares
to losing her.

51:27.753 --> 51:28.889
Nothing.

51:53.178 --> 51:54.215
You feel it yet?

51:55.615 --> 51:57.618
I never feel anything
on this stuff.

51:59.052 --> 52:00.120
You'll feel it.

52:01.421 --> 52:02.590
Wanna bet?

52:06.927 --> 52:10.428
You sh... You should've bet
more than a hot dog.

52:10.430 --> 52:12.030
What are you talking about?
I bet...

52:12.032 --> 52:13.566
I bet hot dogs for life.

52:14.200 --> 52:17.135
Wait, no. I don't...
I don't remember that.

52:17.137 --> 52:18.303
We shook on it, man.

52:18.305 --> 52:20.070
What? You shook my hand.

52:20.072 --> 52:21.808
You think that's gonna
hold up in court?

52:22.374 --> 52:24.608
Mmm. Ah, smells good.

52:24.610 --> 52:27.378
Um... Let me get
one recession special.

52:27.380 --> 52:28.414
Yeah. And for him?

52:29.749 --> 52:31.485
Yo, man, don't do that.
Talk to him.

52:31.952 --> 52:33.454
Sorry. And for you?

52:34.988 --> 52:36.123
I want...

52:37.724 --> 52:41.896
fourteen hot dogs and a banana daiquiri.

52:42.262 --> 52:43.264
You guys high?

52:43.630 --> 52:45.633
Soaring.

52:46.066 --> 52:46.934
You got a dollar?

52:47.633 --> 52:48.936
- Nuh-uh.
- You got a dollar?

52:49.735 --> 52:51.304
All right,
would you like a hot dog?

52:51.905 --> 52:52.937
Yeah.

52:52.939 --> 52:53.908
Oh, okay.

52:54.173 --> 52:56.106
So, 14 hot dogs
and one hot dog.

52:56.108 --> 52:58.108
So, 1,500 hot dogs.

52:58.110 --> 52:59.776
Fifteen hundred hot dogs.

52:59.778 --> 53:01.178
That's what I want.

53:01.180 --> 53:03.016
Just gimme all your hot dogs.

53:05.785 --> 53:07.688
Mmm. Thanks.

53:08.521 --> 53:09.789
And thanks for speaking up.

53:10.856 --> 53:12.625
I get treated with such...

53:15.327 --> 53:16.429
Or I'm invisible.

53:17.530 --> 53:18.865
Unless they know I have money.

53:19.131 --> 53:21.101
Welcome to my world.

53:21.367 --> 53:22.835
I mean, except the money part.

53:23.602 --> 53:25.204
I don't have no damn money.

53:26.039 --> 53:28.039
I guess I gotta do me
some more, uh...

53:28.041 --> 53:29.309
some more lateral thinking.

53:29.642 --> 53:32.510
- I gotta make some changes.
- Oh!

53:32.512 --> 53:34.548
- You've been reading my book.
- I'm trying to.

53:34.947 --> 53:36.215
It's kinda dry, though.

53:36.483 --> 53:38.216
"Dry"? It's not dry.
It's business theory.

53:38.218 --> 53:39.950
Well, okay.

53:39.952 --> 53:42.389
- My... My theory is that the book is dry.
- Dry.

53:42.655 --> 53:44.856
No.

53:44.858 --> 53:47.695
Lateral thinking is like art.

53:49.128 --> 53:50.331
It's another door.

53:50.963 --> 53:51.864
Oh...

53:52.999 --> 53:54.499
Oh...

53:54.501 --> 53:55.867
Are... Are you ready
to have your mind blown?

53:55.869 --> 53:57.667
I'm ready. I'm so ready.

53:57.669 --> 53:59.840
Okay, I got the idea
for my business.

54:00.907 --> 54:02.974
Okay, now, it's a app.

54:02.976 --> 54:04.142
- Okay?
- Yeah.

54:04.144 --> 54:06.577
It's a app that helps you find

54:06.579 --> 54:07.847
the closest weed.

54:10.517 --> 54:11.385
Hmm?

54:12.651 --> 54:14.088
It's called Find My Dealer.

54:15.055 --> 54:17.521
No, no, no. It's not that.

54:17.523 --> 54:20.827
It's... Take that out, okay?
It's called iDeal.

54:23.195 --> 54:26.566
Because of the "I" and "deal."

54:27.332 --> 54:28.369
It's ideal.

54:29.202 --> 54:31.269
You see what I'm saying?
You see how it works?

54:31.271 --> 54:32.836
- I do.
- Right?

54:32.838 --> 54:35.441
But I think you need
to think some more.

54:37.776 --> 54:39.045
It's very niche.

54:40.113 --> 54:41.749
What the hell is "niche"?

54:42.014 --> 54:45.018
It's... It's the girl version
of a nephew.

54:53.593 --> 54:55.225
So, was your family rich?

54:55.227 --> 54:56.764
Your daddy gave you
all his money?

54:57.863 --> 55:00.434
I earned every penny I have.

55:00.867 --> 55:03.370
My dad gave me nothing.

55:03.769 --> 55:05.371
Oh, well,
we got that in common.

55:06.738 --> 55:08.541
You see, my dad was a artist.

55:08.941 --> 55:09.943
He was?

55:10.610 --> 55:13.414
Con. Con artist.

55:14.713 --> 55:16.049
I ain't never see him, though.

55:17.282 --> 55:19.952
Unless you wanna count the time
we spent together in lockup.

55:21.553 --> 55:22.990
We was in prison together.

55:23.423 --> 55:24.457
Sweet, right?

55:26.758 --> 55:28.728
You know what he said
when he saw me, man?

55:30.796 --> 55:32.099
He said, "Welcome home."

55:34.099 --> 55:36.502
Can you imagine saying some
shit like that to your kid?

55:37.970 --> 55:39.005
"Welcome home."

55:41.840 --> 55:44.077
I swear, my son ain't never
going to prison, man.

55:44.343 --> 55:45.512
Too smart.

55:46.579 --> 55:48.148
Boy is so smart.

55:49.581 --> 55:51.250
His mom, she's smart too.

55:53.852 --> 55:55.289
Well, you're smart, Dell.

55:58.423 --> 55:59.659
Smart-ass.

56:00.293 --> 56:03.296
No. No, you're smart.

56:04.697 --> 56:05.765
Intelligent.

56:26.019 --> 56:27.488
All right, you ready?

56:28.021 --> 56:31.525
It's on 163rd. It's just waiting
for the million-dollar idea.

56:31.957 --> 56:33.059
Which you have.

56:33.793 --> 56:37.131
Okay. What do you think of
when I say the word "food"?

56:37.664 --> 56:40.467
I think,
"Don't pitch me a restaurant."

56:41.800 --> 56:44.303
- Forget it, man.
- What? Do you even cook?

56:44.537 --> 56:45.639
I could hire a cook.

56:46.206 --> 56:47.338
Maybe Charlotte.

56:47.340 --> 56:48.207
Oh?

56:48.840 --> 56:50.408
So, your pitch

56:50.410 --> 56:52.809
is that you might hire
my cook away from me?

56:52.811 --> 56:54.579
Forget it. Just forget it.

56:55.914 --> 56:57.150
You're so negative.

57:01.354 --> 57:04.358
Maggie says she's, uh...
she's running late.

57:05.325 --> 57:06.360
Okay.

57:10.530 --> 57:12.265
It can wait.

57:12.564 --> 57:14.568
Well, it says it can't.
Says I gotta change your crazy straw.

57:15.934 --> 57:17.904
Why don't they have
a self-changing catheter?

57:18.570 --> 57:20.206
Okay. Business idea.

57:20.539 --> 57:23.207
What if I told you that I can
create a self-changing catheter?

57:23.209 --> 57:24.908
I would ask

57:24.910 --> 57:26.914
where your biomedical
engineering degree was from.

57:28.581 --> 57:32.718
Look, Dell, just find
something you love doing.

57:34.454 --> 57:36.055
And then find a way
to scale it.

57:39.758 --> 57:41.425
I mean,
what are you really good at?

57:41.427 --> 57:42.963
Well, it's clearly not this.

57:43.695 --> 57:45.364
You know,
can we just not talk?

57:46.032 --> 57:48.566
Especially while I feel like
I'm in the worst porno ever.

57:48.568 --> 57:50.200
It's no big deal.

57:50.202 --> 57:51.470
What you mean,
"It's no big deal"?

57:51.903 --> 57:53.870
You ever touched
another man's, uh...

57:56.709 --> 57:58.245
What?
You can't even say the word?

57:59.311 --> 58:00.580
Yes, I can say the word.

58:01.414 --> 58:02.582
Well, say it.

58:02.981 --> 58:04.284
- No.
- Just say it.

58:04.651 --> 58:05.615
I don't want to.

58:05.617 --> 58:07.153
- Penis.
- Stop it.

58:07.986 --> 58:09.722
Okay, fine. Jeez.

58:11.090 --> 58:12.959
All right. Done.

58:13.626 --> 58:15.128
Young Merlin's got the sword.

58:15.794 --> 58:18.398
So, that would make my penis
the stone, then?

58:19.264 --> 58:20.633
Can you stop saying that word?

58:20.967 --> 58:22.133
Just using your analogy.

58:22.135 --> 58:24.501
Stop saying the word.

58:24.503 --> 58:26.105
- I'm asking you.
- Okay.

58:26.405 --> 58:27.940
- It's not helping me.
- Okay.

58:29.242 --> 58:30.776
All right, so,
I'll take this out.

58:32.845 --> 58:34.014
And then I, um...

58:34.914 --> 58:36.617
I gotta pinch the...
pinch the head.

58:37.483 --> 58:39.919
Put it in. All right?

58:40.153 --> 58:42.086
I'm just letting you know
what's going on.

58:42.088 --> 58:43.490
Um...

58:44.023 --> 58:45.959
All right. Let's do it.

58:47.026 --> 58:48.861
This don't look like
it's gonna fit, man.

58:49.162 --> 58:50.197
That's what she said.

58:56.302 --> 58:57.336
All right.

58:58.204 --> 58:59.273
You ready?

59:00.372 --> 59:02.275
I'm not. I'm not ready.
Gimme a second.

59:03.142 --> 59:04.211
Goddamn.

59:04.843 --> 59:05.878
Come on, Dell.

59:07.880 --> 59:08.948
Shake it off, boy.

59:09.648 --> 59:10.549
Ha!

59:11.517 --> 59:14.221
Ha! Ha!

59:15.722 --> 59:16.622
All right, let's go.

59:17.055 --> 59:18.224
Coming in fast.

59:19.025 --> 59:20.059
Grab it.

59:21.327 --> 59:22.796
What? Come on, man.

59:23.496 --> 59:24.398
Come on, man.

59:24.997 --> 59:26.530
What is that? What?

59:26.532 --> 59:27.865
You have a Cialis
for breakfast or something?

59:27.867 --> 59:29.899
Well, if you quit
playing with it

59:29.901 --> 59:31.369
- maybe it wouldn't have happened.
- Nobody's playing with it.

59:31.371 --> 59:32.506
Ain't nobody
playing with nothing. Go...

59:33.905 --> 59:34.974
Make it go down.

59:35.307 --> 59:37.977
- Make it go down?
- Make... Make it go down.

59:38.211 --> 59:40.711
I'm not gonna continue with you in
this state that you're in right now.

59:40.713 --> 59:42.983
And wait... How do you still...
How do you even...

59:43.349 --> 59:45.084
It's unconscious.

59:45.684 --> 59:47.586
I mean, there are other ways
I can get there.

59:49.222 --> 59:50.890
When you're not available,
that is.

59:52.090 --> 59:55.158
I'll kill you. I'd DNR your ass right now.
Is that what you want?

59:55.160 --> 59:56.729
My ears, for example.

59:57.764 --> 59:59.597
My ears are an erogenous zone.

59:59.599 --> 01:00:01.499
Well, I ain't touched
your damn ears.

01:00:01.501 --> 01:00:04.167
And I don't wanna talk about
erogenous zones right now.

01:00:04.169 --> 01:00:06.102
Okay. Just gimme a minute.

01:00:06.104 --> 01:00:07.937
Come on, man.
The clock is ticking.

01:00:07.939 --> 01:00:09.707
- Okay.
- Come on!

01:00:09.709 --> 01:00:11.575
Listen here, why don't we just
go get Yvonne, all right?

01:00:11.577 --> 01:00:13.276
Maybe she can find someone...

01:00:13.278 --> 01:00:15.111
I don't think we need to talk
about Yvonne either.

01:00:15.113 --> 01:00:17.080
- Why?
- She's probably got a lot to do with that.

01:00:17.082 --> 01:00:18.218
Yv... Wha...

01:00:19.584 --> 01:00:22.086
Come on.
Yvonne is my executive.

01:00:22.088 --> 01:00:25.189
Oh, I forgot. Bosses are never
into their employees.

01:00:25.191 --> 01:00:26.724
No, that's ridiculous.
I'd have...

01:00:26.726 --> 01:00:28.595
Yeah, well,
your penis calls, "Bullshit."

01:00:29.061 --> 01:00:30.961
Boom! You wanted me to say it?
I said it.

01:00:30.963 --> 01:00:32.698
Penis.

01:00:33.765 --> 01:00:34.633
Uh...

01:00:39.271 --> 01:00:40.937
Uh, Yvonne, we...

01:00:40.939 --> 01:00:43.209
we need a couple minutes more,
if you don't mind.

01:00:44.744 --> 01:00:46.477
Yeah. We were just
talking about you too.

01:00:46.479 --> 01:00:48.615
Your ears must've
been burning. Like, on fire.

01:00:56.289 --> 01:00:57.991
We're right here.
This us right here.

01:01:12.472 --> 01:01:13.506
Come on, y'all.

01:01:14.106 --> 01:01:16.109
Hey,
you didn't see anything, okay?

01:01:42.668 --> 01:01:43.503
No.

01:01:44.202 --> 01:01:45.371
Just stay on his ears.

01:01:54.514 --> 01:01:57.448
I'm telling you, P, you could
have any girl you want, man.

01:01:57.450 --> 01:01:59.186
You rich and you available.

01:01:59.718 --> 01:02:02.119
What about this lady right
here with all the Botox?

01:02:02.121 --> 01:02:03.789
Y'all would be perfect
for each other.

01:02:04.289 --> 01:02:06.990
You can't move your body
and she can't move her face.

01:02:06.992 --> 01:02:08.358
Huh?

01:02:15.367 --> 01:02:16.669
- How's that?
- That's good.

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:23.709
- Hey, you married?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:24.075 --> 01:02:25.579
- Like, how married?
- Dell.

01:02:26.412 --> 01:02:28.014
There's levels to marriage.

01:02:28.581 --> 01:02:30.580
Hey, I got it.
What if we created a app,

01:02:30.582 --> 01:02:32.485
like a dating app,
for billionaires?

01:02:32.818 --> 01:02:34.017
It already exists.

01:02:34.019 --> 01:02:35.889
Damn.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.661
Mmm.

01:02:43.361 --> 01:02:44.331
You with him?

01:02:46.197 --> 01:02:47.066
Why?

01:02:50.602 --> 01:02:51.938
How young would you go, P?

01:02:52.338 --> 01:02:54.204
Dell, enough.

01:02:54.206 --> 01:02:56.008
- What do you mean, "enough"? Just an...
- Shh!

01:02:56.409 --> 01:02:57.443
Who you shushing?

01:02:58.543 --> 01:03:00.613
Ain't even start singing yet.
Relax.

01:03:02.548 --> 01:03:03.750
How long is this show?

01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:05.351
Three hours.

01:03:15.093 --> 01:03:16.128
He a tree?

01:03:17.063 --> 01:03:18.131
He's a singing tree?

01:03:19.932 --> 01:03:21.767
He's the birdman.

01:03:22.468 --> 01:03:23.733
He's the birdman?

01:03:26.072 --> 01:03:26.939
Shh!

01:03:33.278 --> 01:03:34.648
He the birdman.

01:03:35.447 --> 01:03:38.115
Quiet!

01:03:38.117 --> 01:03:40.754
Shh!

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.253
I'm about to throw this book
back there.

01:03:43.255 --> 01:03:44.421
I promise you I am.

01:03:44.423 --> 01:03:45.592
Sorry.

01:04:32.003 --> 01:04:33.272
Yeah!

01:04:34.039 --> 01:04:35.374
Bravo!

01:04:35.941 --> 01:04:36.810
Bravo!

01:04:37.209 --> 01:04:38.642
Bravo!

01:04:52.057 --> 01:04:55.160
"'Were
not all her life but storm,

01:04:55.461 --> 01:05:00.467
would not painters paint a form
of such noble lines, ' I said.

01:05:00.999 --> 01:05:03.135
'Such a delicate high head,

01:05:03.802 --> 01:05:06.205
all that sternness amid charm,

01:05:06.805 --> 01:05:09.541
all that sweetness
amid strength?'"

01:05:09.909 --> 01:05:11.744
That's beautiful, Philip.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.396
Busted.

01:05:31.262 --> 01:05:33.830
- Excuse me?
- Aw, ain't no "excuse me."

01:05:33.832 --> 01:05:35.064
I got you good.

01:05:35.066 --> 01:05:36.503
Where is he? Where's he at?

01:05:36.735 --> 01:05:38.570
You and P, huh?

01:05:39.104 --> 01:05:41.738
Talking 'bout your "high head"
and your "sternness."

01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:44.576
He's got you numbered.
That man is painting you with his words.

01:05:46.244 --> 01:05:47.413
Don't look at me like that.

01:05:47.747 --> 01:05:48.782
I heard you.

01:05:52.785 --> 01:05:54.251
Don't do that.

01:05:54.253 --> 01:05:56.923
It's his lifeline.
Remember that? Hmm?

01:05:58.256 --> 01:05:59.726
How long you and P
been doin' this?

01:06:00.526 --> 01:06:02.792
There is no P and me.

01:06:02.794 --> 01:06:04.863
Stop it. I heard you, Yvonne.

01:06:05.363 --> 01:06:07.900
And what I heard was some
Marvin Gaye-level poetry.

01:06:08.534 --> 01:06:11.570
He writes letters
to a woman named Lily.

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:16.075
He dictates them to me.

01:06:16.776 --> 01:06:18.812
- Wait a minute, that's what those are?
- Yes.

01:06:20.479 --> 01:06:21.881
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

01:06:22.447 --> 01:06:24.814
But I thought he was throwin' those away.

01:06:24.816 --> 01:06:25.985
Not anymore.

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:29.255
Wait a minute.

01:06:30.655 --> 01:06:32.157
Wait a minute.

01:06:32.624 --> 01:06:34.827
This is the part where
you say, "Thank you, Dell."

01:06:35.427 --> 01:06:37.296
- What for?
- What do you mean, "What for?"

01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:39.965
Why is he doing that,
Yvonne? Huh?

01:06:40.265 --> 01:06:41.334
It's because of me.

01:06:41.834 --> 01:06:43.970
I'm the one that got him
back to his old self.

01:06:44.403 --> 01:06:45.972
That's my to-do
and you know it.

01:06:47.072 --> 01:06:49.142
"Thank you, Dell."
"You're welcome, Yvonne."

01:06:55.014 --> 01:06:56.483
Maggie said
you went to Harvard.

01:06:57.849 --> 01:06:59.284
Mm-hmm. Yes.

01:07:00.619 --> 01:07:02.952
So, then why you wasting
your time taking dictation?

01:07:02.954 --> 01:07:04.323
I'm not wasting my time.

01:07:05.124 --> 01:07:06.426
How long
you been working here?

01:07:07.026 --> 01:07:08.995
I used to work for him
years ago.

01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:11.595
Before the accident.

01:07:11.597 --> 01:07:13.162
And then I had to leave
because my mother got sick.

01:07:13.164 --> 01:07:14.800
And then you came back here?

01:07:16.202 --> 01:07:17.200
No.

01:07:17.202 --> 01:07:18.271
Then I got married.

01:07:18.537 --> 01:07:20.372
And then I came back here.

01:07:20.706 --> 01:07:22.108
After I heard about Philip.

01:07:23.508 --> 01:07:24.376
I...

01:07:24.809 --> 01:07:25.878
I thought I could help.

01:07:27.146 --> 01:07:28.014
You're married?

01:07:30.048 --> 01:07:31.717
Was. Briefly.

01:07:32.684 --> 01:07:34.785
So, now that that's over,
what are you looking for?

01:07:34.787 --> 01:07:37.290
- Like, what's your type?
- I'm not looking.

01:07:39.557 --> 01:07:40.559
I got your type.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.725
Lumberjack.

01:07:42.727 --> 01:07:44.630
Lots of plaid.
Big old beard, probably.

01:07:45.296 --> 01:07:48.164
One of those beards you could
lose stuff in. Where my keys at?

01:07:48.166 --> 01:07:50.533
Anybody see my fishing pole?
Where my damn pole at?

01:07:50.535 --> 01:07:52.736
That is literally
the opposite of my type.

01:07:52.738 --> 01:07:53.640
I hate beards.

01:07:55.541 --> 01:07:56.743
No offense.

01:07:57.075 --> 01:07:58.744
But at least you admitted
that you got a type.

01:07:59.845 --> 01:08:01.214
I'm not looking, Dell.

01:08:02.247 --> 01:08:03.148
Mm-hmm.

01:08:04.416 --> 01:08:05.584
I found a cat!

01:08:06.751 --> 01:08:07.887
It was in my beard.

01:08:09.053 --> 01:08:10.923
Oh...

01:08:12.925 --> 01:08:14.928
You're tough. You're so tough.

01:08:16.761 --> 01:08:17.663
Knock, knock.

01:08:18.197 --> 01:08:19.231
Nope.

01:08:19.497 --> 01:08:20.365
Knock, knock.

01:08:21.934 --> 01:08:23.666
I will sit here
and knock all day.

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:24.536
Knock, knock.

01:08:25.703 --> 01:08:27.437
Who's there?

01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:28.341
Yvonne.

01:08:28.706 --> 01:08:30.240
Yvonne, who?

01:08:30.242 --> 01:08:31.778
Yvonne to make you laugh.

01:08:34.947 --> 01:08:36.444
Thank you, Dell.

01:08:36.447 --> 01:08:37.913
I was just warmin' up, okay?
Don't leave yet.

01:08:37.916 --> 01:08:39.749
- One more. One more.
- Thank you, Dell.

01:08:39.751 --> 01:08:41.118
How you make a napkin dance?

01:08:42.386 --> 01:08:44.520
Put a little boogie in it.

01:08:44.523 --> 01:08:45.390
Look.

01:08:46.024 --> 01:08:47.557
Look.

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.578
- Watch out!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:09:43.581 --> 01:09:45.247
Whoo!

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:47.249
How did you do this?

01:09:47.251 --> 01:09:49.019
What do you mean, "How did I do
this?" 'Cause I'm a genius, man.

01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:53.992
"I would spread
the cloths under your feet.

01:09:55.294 --> 01:09:58.430
But I, being poor,
have only my dreams.

01:09:59.164 --> 01:10:01.800
I have spread my dreams
under your feet.

01:10:03.268 --> 01:10:04.304
Tread softly

01:10:05.771 --> 01:10:07.604
because you tread
on my dreams."

01:10:11.844 --> 01:10:13.543
What?

01:10:13.545 --> 01:10:14.948
P, I hate to break it to you,
but you ain't poor.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:18.181
I'm quoting Yeats,
a famous poet.

01:10:18.183 --> 01:10:19.786
I know who she is.

01:10:21.353 --> 01:10:23.289
Why don't you write Lily
your own poem?

01:10:23.988 --> 01:10:27.324
Hmm?
Like, one using your words.

01:10:27.326 --> 01:10:29.226
Oh, I'm... I am not a poet.

01:10:29.228 --> 01:10:31.064
What you talking about?
Everybody's a poet.

01:10:31.796 --> 01:10:34.400
All right. How does the
thought of her make you feel?

01:10:36.468 --> 01:10:38.504
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do. Come on, man.

01:10:42.508 --> 01:10:43.509
Light?

01:10:44.343 --> 01:10:45.711
All right. Light as a...

01:10:46.245 --> 01:10:47.146
A feather?

01:10:48.046 --> 01:10:49.147
A whisper.

01:10:49.915 --> 01:10:51.851
Ooh. I like that.

01:10:53.352 --> 01:10:55.421
All right. What else
does she make you feel?

01:10:56.722 --> 01:10:59.155
Uh...
I don't know. Brave?

01:10:59.157 --> 01:11:01.526
Brave. Brave as a...

01:11:02.193 --> 01:11:03.262
Doberman.

01:11:04.595 --> 01:11:06.264
- Mm-mmm.
- Arrow.

01:11:07.331 --> 01:11:08.601
Doberman with an arrow.

01:11:09.567 --> 01:11:12.371
Uh, I... I think just "arrow."

01:11:13.037 --> 01:11:15.439
How about when you see her?
What she look like?

01:11:15.441 --> 01:11:16.608
Don't say, "Doberman."

01:11:17.375 --> 01:11:19.445
I... I... I don't know
what she looks like.

01:11:19.745 --> 01:11:20.847
What do you mean?

01:11:21.213 --> 01:11:22.846
Well, it's
an epistolary relationship.

01:11:22.848 --> 01:11:23.883
We just write letters.

01:11:26.552 --> 01:11:28.017
Wh...

01:11:28.019 --> 01:11:29.287
Well, how long
you been epistolaryin'?

01:11:29.921 --> 01:11:30.790
About a year.

01:11:31.223 --> 01:11:32.625
A year?

01:11:33.125 --> 01:11:35.092
You been receiving these
little blue letters for a year?

01:11:35.094 --> 01:11:36.896
- Yes.
- Well, I know what else is blue.

01:11:37.795 --> 01:11:39.895
So, you have no idea
what this woman looks like?

01:11:41.232 --> 01:11:42.300
Nor she I.

01:11:42.601 --> 01:11:43.733
Yes, she does.

01:11:43.735 --> 01:11:45.267
What do you mean, "Nor she I"?

01:11:45.269 --> 01:11:47.040
What... What century
are you in right now?

01:11:47.371 --> 01:11:50.373
Look, I don't think
you fully understand

01:11:50.375 --> 01:11:52.812
how an epistolary relationship
works.

01:11:53.312 --> 01:11:56.115
And I don't think you
understand how a woman works.

01:11:56.548 --> 01:11:57.617
She Googled you.

01:11:58.217 --> 01:11:59.117
Yvonne.

01:11:59.451 --> 01:12:00.887
- I'm here.
- Hey.

01:12:01.286 --> 01:12:03.587
- As for...
- Maggie, Maggie. Lemme ask you a question.

01:12:03.589 --> 01:12:06.455
If you were Lily, would you
have Googled P's ass?

01:12:06.457 --> 01:12:08.428
Or my face, perhaps?

01:12:09.495 --> 01:12:10.662
Probably both.

01:12:11.429 --> 01:12:12.964
What'd I tell you? Hmm?

01:12:14.265 --> 01:12:15.601
Charlotte.

01:12:15.968 --> 01:12:18.001
Charlotte, if you were in
an epistolary love triangle

01:12:18.003 --> 01:12:19.401
with an Iron Chef,

01:12:19.403 --> 01:12:21.104
would you look up
a picture of him?

01:12:21.106 --> 01:12:22.605
First day.

01:12:22.607 --> 01:12:24.807
Hmm? I know
what I'm talkin' about, man.

01:12:24.809 --> 01:12:26.912
I wanna see what your
Google Search look like.

01:12:27.411 --> 01:12:29.448
All right. LaCasse. Mmm.

01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:32.151
You look good, man.

01:12:32.784 --> 01:12:34.253
You clean up well.

01:12:34.753 --> 01:12:36.986
And I'm serious. I don't just say that.
You look real good.

01:12:36.988 --> 01:12:38.687
- Wow.
- I wanna see what she look like.

01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:39.692
What's her last name?

01:12:41.793 --> 01:12:43.329
I'm not telling you that.

01:12:45.129 --> 01:12:47.029
- No, listen... Dell.
- Stop talkin' like that.

01:12:47.031 --> 01:12:48.498
- I wanna see.
- Give me the letter.

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.770
Foley. From Buffalo. Ooh!

01:12:51.370 --> 01:12:52.705
Oh, Lily gonna be big.

01:12:53.504 --> 01:12:54.870
It's cold in Buffalo.

01:12:54.872 --> 01:12:56.476
She gonna be
a big, ol' flower.

01:12:57.041 --> 01:12:57.977
Oh.

01:12:58.710 --> 01:13:00.179
All right.
Let's search it.

01:13:00.545 --> 01:13:02.615
She say anything to you
about a 103rd birthday?

01:13:05.017 --> 01:13:06.318
Ever mention a mug shot?

01:13:06.985 --> 01:13:08.851
- Oh, God.
- All right, enough.

01:13:08.853 --> 01:13:09.789
Ooh!

01:13:10.555 --> 01:13:12.290
This little Lily
been to market.

01:13:13.192 --> 01:13:14.160
A lot.

01:13:14.459 --> 01:13:16.028
- All right.
- Now, she cute.

01:13:16.327 --> 01:13:19.361
Hello. See, but I need
more information. This how...

01:13:19.363 --> 01:13:21.131
You gotta turn into, like,
a detective.

01:13:21.133 --> 01:13:22.966
- Come on.
- There's nothing in there.

01:13:22.968 --> 01:13:25.204
- That is private, Dell.
- Just let me see if I see a clue.

01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:28.340
There's a phone number
on this, man.

01:13:28.573 --> 01:13:30.239
So?

01:13:30.241 --> 01:13:31.643
What do you mean, "So?"
Why don't you call her?

01:13:32.044 --> 01:13:34.578
Because that's not
the relationship we have.

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:36.378
What you mean,
"It's not you rela..."

01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:37.413
- Cut it out, man.
- No.

01:13:37.415 --> 01:13:38.515
Give me the phone.

01:13:38.517 --> 01:13:39.916
- No, no, no.
- Stop.

01:13:39.918 --> 01:13:41.217
- Do not call her.
- It's private.

01:13:41.219 --> 01:13:42.651
Please, give me the phone.

01:13:42.653 --> 01:13:44.654
Yvonne,
don't grab at me like that.

01:13:44.656 --> 01:13:46.359
- Don't. Don't call.
- Just give me my phone back.

01:13:46.724 --> 01:13:47.990
It's ringin'.

01:13:47.992 --> 01:13:49.492
- It's ringin'.
- Just hang up.

01:13:49.494 --> 01:13:50.993
- Give me...
- It's ringin' right now.

01:13:50.995 --> 01:13:52.497
Hello,
you've reached Lily Foley.

01:13:52.897 --> 01:13:54.900
Please leave a message
when you hear the tone,

01:13:55.166 --> 01:13:57.266
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

01:14:04.942 --> 01:14:08.046
Lily, it's Philip...

01:14:09.848 --> 01:14:10.883
LaCasse.

01:14:12.351 --> 01:14:13.451
And I... I just...

01:14:14.719 --> 01:14:16.088
wanted to hear your voice.

01:14:16.955 --> 01:14:18.922
- Ask her if she work out.
- Shh!

01:14:18.924 --> 01:14:20.757
Ask...

01:14:20.759 --> 01:14:23.362
I was wondering
if you might return my call...

01:14:23.894 --> 01:14:25.263
uh, whenever is convenient.

01:14:28.299 --> 01:14:32.437
All right. Um,
I look forward to speaking.

01:14:34.906 --> 01:14:35.942
Bye, now.

01:14:39.244 --> 01:14:40.412
That is my phone.

01:14:40.946 --> 01:14:42.148
That was good, man.

01:14:42.781 --> 01:14:44.584
All you needed
was a little push.

01:14:54.558 --> 01:14:57.060
Javik wants to do
the call on Thursday.

01:14:57.062 --> 01:14:59.665
Uh, we have the benefit
on Friday.

01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:01.000
And...

01:15:01.566 --> 01:15:03.469
you have a birthday coming up.

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:10.242
What do you wanna do?

01:15:12.009 --> 01:15:13.111
For your birthday?

01:15:15.414 --> 01:15:16.415
Would you have...

01:15:17.081 --> 01:15:17.983
Googled me?

01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:23.022
I'm not sure, I...

01:15:24.289 --> 01:15:25.791
- I don't think so.
- Hmm.

01:15:27.425 --> 01:15:29.361
- But I'm old-fashioned.
- Hmm.

01:15:30.195 --> 01:15:32.031
Anyway, it shouldn't
make a difference.

01:15:36.101 --> 01:15:38.200
If she's as lovely
as she seems in her letters,

01:15:38.202 --> 01:15:39.437
it won't matter to her.

01:15:41.039 --> 01:15:42.608
Until she sees the chair.

01:15:45.344 --> 01:15:47.880
Smart women care about
what's up here and in here.

01:15:48.679 --> 01:15:50.346
That's what's gonna move
the right woman.

01:15:50.348 --> 01:15:51.950
Not your hands.

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:56.488
Yo.

01:15:57.555 --> 01:15:59.659
I need y'all to come out
in the hallway real quick.

01:16:00.058 --> 01:16:01.961
- Have you been painting?
- Just come on.

01:16:03.995 --> 01:16:05.060
He paints?

01:16:07.832 --> 01:16:08.968
All right. Y'all ready?

01:16:15.906 --> 01:16:19.010
I give you
Untitled Number Zero.

01:16:19.544 --> 01:16:22.682
Or What is Bravery?

01:16:27.652 --> 01:16:29.055
Where's the Twombly?

01:16:29.821 --> 01:16:31.654
You talkin' about the one
that had the, uh,

01:16:31.656 --> 01:16:33.256
the red, squiggly lines on it?

01:16:33.258 --> 01:16:35.758
- Yes.
- I took it down. I put it in the kitchen.

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.162
Right next to the recycle bin.

01:16:38.028 --> 01:16:38.897
Uh-huh.

01:16:40.499 --> 01:16:41.901
What do you think? Come on.

01:16:42.166 --> 01:16:44.503
Well, I'm not saying
I'd hang it, but...

01:16:45.336 --> 01:16:48.506
- there's something...
- Something very passionate.

01:16:48.773 --> 01:16:51.110
Almost post-postmodern.

01:16:52.177 --> 01:16:53.278
I like the dog.

01:16:55.112 --> 01:16:57.582
It's... unexpected.

01:16:59.217 --> 01:17:01.420
And I... I say that
with admiration.

01:17:03.621 --> 01:17:04.789
Who knows, man?

01:17:05.122 --> 01:17:06.392
I might be the next...

01:17:07.459 --> 01:17:08.626
the next Baskwat.

01:17:09.428 --> 01:17:11.060
Life is crazy.

01:17:11.062 --> 01:17:12.798
Charlotte,
go find the Twombly.

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.137
- You can't be serious.
- Well...

01:17:18.603 --> 01:17:20.736
it may not be
your cup of tea, or mine...

01:17:20.738 --> 01:17:22.375
Or even in the tea family.

01:17:24.276 --> 01:17:28.313
But the important thing is to
see and encourage potential.

01:17:30.147 --> 01:17:31.916
Don't you see potential here?

01:17:53.237 --> 01:17:54.406
Hey.

01:17:57.909 --> 01:17:59.809
Ah-ha. No.

01:17:59.811 --> 01:18:01.778
I thought I could tie this
to the back of your chair,

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:03.745
put the hat on your head,
let the string hang down.

01:18:03.747 --> 01:18:06.516
- Not happening.
- Come on, man. It's your birthday.

01:18:06.518 --> 01:18:09.255
And I don't do birthdays, as you know.

01:18:09.487 --> 01:18:11.089
But I would like
to go for a drive.

01:18:11.322 --> 01:18:12.622
All right. Where to?

01:18:12.624 --> 01:18:13.626
Wherever you want.

01:18:15.326 --> 01:18:16.195
For true?

01:18:16.661 --> 01:18:17.530
For true.

01:18:28.706 --> 01:18:29.775
Yo, Ant.

01:18:30.642 --> 01:18:31.677
What's up, man?

01:18:33.844 --> 01:18:35.680
Come on,
we gonna take you for a ride.

01:18:37.448 --> 01:18:38.451
Come on, get in.

01:18:40.518 --> 01:18:41.719
It's a cool car, man.

01:18:50.061 --> 01:18:50.963
Hello.

01:18:54.366 --> 01:18:57.132
- You his driver or something?
- Um...

01:18:57.134 --> 01:18:59.037
He is my chief executive.

01:18:59.670 --> 01:19:00.705
My right-hand man.

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:03.175
My left hand too.

01:19:05.343 --> 01:19:07.513
All right.

01:19:08.079 --> 01:19:11.814
- Playlist, Dell's Jam.
- No, no. Please, no.

01:19:11.816 --> 01:19:13.882
No, you don't say no
to the Queen. Come on.

01:19:13.884 --> 01:19:16.754
I can see your funk soul
begging for it right now.

01:19:17.088 --> 01:19:18.687
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

01:19:18.689 --> 01:19:22.193
arms and hands inside
the vehicle at all times.

01:19:22.727 --> 01:19:24.226
I'm watching you, P.

01:19:24.228 --> 01:19:25.664
You keep them hands
where I can see 'em.

01:19:26.665 --> 01:19:29.335
Look right there. Look to your left.
There goes Yankee Stadium.

01:19:30.101 --> 01:19:32.403
Hey, I got a question for you.
Could you buy the Yankees?

01:19:32.704 --> 01:19:34.240
Uh. No.

01:19:34.539 --> 01:19:35.840
Could you buy the Mets?

01:19:36.508 --> 01:19:37.343
Oh, yeah.

01:19:43.113 --> 01:19:46.949
Wow, you see this?

01:19:46.951 --> 01:19:50.019
That's where I schooled the world
in the fine art of the dunk.

01:19:50.021 --> 01:19:51.557
You cannot dunk.

01:19:52.691 --> 01:19:53.692
You never seen me.

01:19:54.192 --> 01:19:55.725
Nobody's ever seen you.

01:19:57.696 --> 01:19:58.964
What are we laughing at, P?

01:19:59.397 --> 01:20:00.966
Um, I don't know.

01:20:04.469 --> 01:20:05.604
Oh.

01:20:09.773 --> 01:20:11.410
- Wow! That is amazing.
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:11.776 --> 01:20:13.242
We could franchise.

01:20:13.244 --> 01:20:14.880
It's the best ice cream
in America, P.

01:20:15.479 --> 01:20:16.415
America.

01:20:20.818 --> 01:20:21.754
Dad!

01:20:51.348 --> 01:20:52.584
It was nice to meet you.

01:20:53.617 --> 01:20:54.452
Hey.

01:20:55.019 --> 01:20:56.688
Look Mr. LaCasse
in the eye, man.

01:20:58.423 --> 01:21:00.826
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too, Anthony.

01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:02.861
- I'll be right back, P.
- Okay.

01:21:03.294 --> 01:21:04.363
Hey.

01:21:04.662 --> 01:21:06.298
- You have a good time today?
- Yeah.

01:21:06.598 --> 01:21:08.765
- What'd you think about the car, though?
- Oh, it's cool.

01:21:08.767 --> 01:21:09.867
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah.

01:21:10.168 --> 01:21:11.868
Maybe we take it out
this weekend.

01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:13.770
We'll go anywhere
you want, man.

01:21:13.772 --> 01:21:14.773
Okay.

01:21:15.874 --> 01:21:17.309
Yo, did your mom talk to you?

01:21:19.044 --> 01:21:20.211
The, um...

01:21:20.711 --> 01:21:22.647
The book I gave you?
I gotta get that book back.

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:23.881
Why?

01:21:24.782 --> 01:21:26.050
'Cause some stuff came up.

01:21:26.684 --> 01:21:28.618
I just need you
to run up and grab it for me.

01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:29.955
But weren't
you giving it to me?

01:21:30.455 --> 01:21:31.689
Yeah, I was.

01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:33.559
It's just a misunderstanding,
that's all.

01:21:34.392 --> 01:21:35.494
Is it his book?

01:21:36.227 --> 01:21:37.563
- Whose book?
- Your boss.

01:21:38.897 --> 01:21:40.064
You stole it from him?

01:21:42.232 --> 01:21:43.901
Anthony, listen to me.

01:21:44.702 --> 01:21:45.803
Hey, Anthony!

01:21:47.805 --> 01:21:49.174
I didn't know this was yours.

01:21:52.876 --> 01:21:54.679
- Hey, why would you...
- Let go of me!

01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:57.915
Anthony, come here.

01:21:59.084 --> 01:22:00.552
Hey, come here, man.

01:22:19.737 --> 01:22:21.406
It was before
you hired me, man.

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:23.541
I was gonna put it back.

01:22:25.943 --> 01:22:27.211
Books are meant to be read.

01:22:29.113 --> 01:22:30.448
Should've told you, though.

01:22:32.282 --> 01:22:33.583
I ain't no thief.

01:22:33.585 --> 01:22:34.853
I mean, I was. But...

01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:37.356
I'm done with that.

01:22:41.893 --> 01:22:43.395
People make mistakes.

01:22:45.429 --> 01:22:46.464
I don't know.

01:22:47.965 --> 01:22:49.267
I've made so many.

01:23:05.282 --> 01:23:07.449
Surprise!

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:11.089
This is from my cellar.

01:23:11.656 --> 01:23:12.922
Happy birthday.

01:23:12.924 --> 01:23:14.489
- Happy birthday.
- Wow.

01:23:14.491 --> 01:23:15.792
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

01:23:15.794 --> 01:23:17.059
Thank you. Thank you.

01:23:17.061 --> 01:23:18.794
Happy birthday, Philip.

01:23:18.796 --> 01:23:19.732
- Happy birthday, Philip.
- Thank you very much.

01:23:25.436 --> 01:23:28.069
- We should probably go out back.
- I specifically said,

01:23:28.071 --> 01:23:30.138
"Nothing for my birthday."

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.442
I didn't... I...

01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:36.145
Everybody wanted to do something
and I just thought that...

01:23:36.147 --> 01:23:38.513
Yvonne, there are
very few things in my life

01:23:38.515 --> 01:23:39.684
I can control.

01:23:39.983 --> 01:23:41.583
And you know that.

01:23:41.585 --> 01:23:44.186
My time and the people
I choose to share it with

01:23:44.188 --> 01:23:45.453
are at the top of my list.

01:23:45.455 --> 01:23:46.521
I know.

01:23:46.523 --> 01:23:47.793
I'm sorry. I...

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:52.965
I'm gonna tell them
that they all should leave.

01:23:56.968 --> 01:23:58.103
Did you know about this?

01:23:59.103 --> 01:23:59.972
Huh?

01:24:01.772 --> 01:24:02.807
I'm sorry, P.

01:24:04.108 --> 01:24:06.644
I'm sorry you gotta have a surprise
party in your huge mansion.

01:24:07.378 --> 01:24:10.182
You gotta get a bunch of expensive
gifts from your rich friends.

01:24:10.514 --> 01:24:12.517
I'm sorry that you got
a thoughtful executive.

01:24:13.884 --> 01:24:15.454
Some of us got real problems.

01:24:16.019 --> 01:24:17.555
I'm fighting to see my son.

01:24:18.822 --> 01:24:19.855
Oh.

01:24:19.857 --> 01:24:21.192
I'm sorry, D.

01:24:22.059 --> 01:24:23.993
Is a single afternoon
with your son

01:24:23.995 --> 01:24:26.662
not enough to repair
the years of neglect?

01:24:26.664 --> 01:24:28.698
- Watch your mouth, man.
- And whose fault is it

01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:30.135
that you can't see him?

01:24:30.902 --> 01:24:31.970
Screw you.

01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:34.473
And screw
your damn privilege, man.

01:24:35.807 --> 01:24:37.309
And your attitude, man.

01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:44.415
Are you mad?

01:24:45.817 --> 01:24:46.852
You mad, P?

01:24:58.028 --> 01:24:59.263
What? You wanna break this?

01:25:00.365 --> 01:25:02.166
You wanna break
Carter's bottle of wine?

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.434
Huh? You wanna break
this big-ass bottle of wine?

01:25:05.436 --> 01:25:06.671
Yes!

01:25:07.738 --> 01:25:10.041
What else you wanna do, P?

01:25:13.177 --> 01:25:14.713
Hmm?
You want this, right here?

01:25:21.786 --> 01:25:23.852
Th... The bull.

01:25:23.854 --> 01:25:25.223
I've always hated that.

01:25:34.098 --> 01:25:35.200
The portrait.

01:25:36.433 --> 01:25:37.802
No, no! Not that one.

01:25:38.068 --> 01:25:39.103
- This one?
- No.

01:25:39.804 --> 01:25:41.270
- This one, right here?
- No!

01:25:41.272 --> 01:25:42.904
- Which one?
- The one behind you.

01:25:42.906 --> 01:25:44.108
- This one?
- Yes.

01:25:54.384 --> 01:25:55.419
He a relative?

01:25:57.921 --> 01:25:58.954
It's...

01:25:58.956 --> 01:26:00.258
It's a she.

01:26:00.657 --> 01:26:03.061
Are you sure that this...
that this is a she?

01:26:04.594 --> 01:26:06.999
That's Jenny's Aunt Winnie.

01:26:07.999 --> 01:26:11.570
It's actually a very
flattering portrait of her too.

01:26:14.138 --> 01:26:15.006
What...

01:26:22.914 --> 01:26:24.015
Dell made a mess.

01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:30.656
I'm sorry.

01:26:32.622 --> 01:26:34.125
And I'm sorry
I snapped at you.

01:26:35.125 --> 01:26:36.294
You didn't deserve that.

01:26:38.595 --> 01:26:41.032
Oh, it's... It's all right.

01:26:47.804 --> 01:26:49.140
Oh, shit.

01:26:50.308 --> 01:26:51.510
Are the guests still here?

01:26:55.679 --> 01:26:56.981
You ready to go party?

01:27:02.452 --> 01:27:03.554
I am if you are.

01:27:25.809 --> 01:27:28.647
How well do you know Dell Scott?

01:27:29.347 --> 01:27:30.678
Why?

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:32.817
Well, I can
e-mail this to you.

01:27:36.219 --> 01:27:37.720
No, I know about his past.

01:27:37.722 --> 01:27:39.558
I'm more interested
in his present.

01:27:39.857 --> 01:27:40.892
Philip, I get it.

01:27:41.558 --> 01:27:42.827
Second chances.

01:27:43.494 --> 01:27:46.430
But how many chances
has this man had?

01:27:46.997 --> 01:27:48.332
He's done real time.

01:27:49.332 --> 01:27:51.702
And you have him working
in a building we all live in.

01:27:51.936 --> 01:27:53.438
Which is my right.

01:27:54.037 --> 01:27:55.741
Just think about
what I'm saying.

01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:57.909
We all gotta live here.

01:28:01.112 --> 01:28:02.381
Is this new?

01:28:04.448 --> 01:28:05.517
Yes.

01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:07.586
Yes, I just acquired it.

01:28:07.884 --> 01:28:08.919
Who's the artist?

01:28:10.588 --> 01:28:12.924
He goes by various names.

01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:14.860
Is it a Banksy?

01:28:15.293 --> 01:28:17.528
Oh, we don't really know,
do we?

01:28:19.296 --> 01:28:21.232
You know what
the Doberman represents?

01:28:21.799 --> 01:28:22.701
Well...

01:28:24.367 --> 01:28:25.370
obviously.

01:28:26.237 --> 01:28:27.770
Yeah, we've tried it all over.

01:28:27.772 --> 01:28:29.975
I mean, everybody loves it,
of course, but...

01:28:31.209 --> 01:28:34.776
it has to speak to you.
It has to say, "I belong here."

01:28:34.778 --> 01:28:35.647
Mmm.

01:28:36.313 --> 01:28:37.214
Yeah.

01:28:37.881 --> 01:28:40.285
Yeah.
We'll probably auction it.

01:28:41.085 --> 01:28:42.952
I just hate
the fees they take.

01:28:42.954 --> 01:28:44.752
Well, all they care about
is the money.

01:28:44.754 --> 01:28:45.623
Mmm.

01:28:48.058 --> 01:28:49.427
Do you think it'll appreciate?

01:28:51.495 --> 01:28:54.265
I think there's no telling
what it could be worth, Carter.

01:28:55.465 --> 01:28:56.434
Hmm.

01:28:56.901 --> 01:28:58.601
I mean,
it's the first time...

01:28:58.603 --> 01:29:00.472
- Hello, Jane.
- Oh, hello, Philip.

01:29:00.972 --> 01:29:02.504
Dell and I
were just talking about

01:29:02.506 --> 01:29:04.576
- what it means to be black.
- Mm-hmm.

01:29:05.242 --> 01:29:06.111
Ah-ha.

01:29:07.144 --> 01:29:10.182
Dell,
how is that iDeal app coming?

01:29:11.115 --> 01:29:12.284
You already said no to that.

01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:14.283
Yes, I know I said no.

01:29:14.285 --> 01:29:17.685
But I would definitely
say yes right about now.

01:29:26.796 --> 01:29:28.500
Whoo!

01:29:31.268 --> 01:29:32.169
- Beep beep.
- Oh!

01:29:33.004 --> 01:29:34.305
- Oh!
- Oh.

01:29:41.012 --> 01:29:42.280
What happened to the music?

01:29:43.613 --> 01:29:46.183
Yo! Hey, soprano.

01:29:47.218 --> 01:29:49.287
No, the lyric.
Not... Not the mezzo.

01:29:50.821 --> 01:29:52.687
Hey.

01:29:52.689 --> 01:29:54.890
Can you do me a solid and sing
the Queen of the Night aria?

01:29:54.892 --> 01:29:57.325
Listen, y'all don't have to
worry about nothin', okay?

01:29:57.327 --> 01:30:00.229
Don't worry about none of the overtime.
Chuckles will take care of it.

01:30:36.933 --> 01:30:40.502
So, you've become
an opera buff.

01:30:40.504 --> 01:30:41.706
Ooh.

01:30:42.005 --> 01:30:43.905
Look, man, I mean,
some of it's pretty cool.

01:30:43.907 --> 01:30:45.610
- Yeah.
- It's just hard to dance to.

01:30:46.876 --> 01:30:47.912
So?

01:30:48.545 --> 01:30:49.613
What have you got?

01:30:57.687 --> 01:31:00.457
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:04.295
Maggie!

01:31:05.362 --> 01:31:06.697
It's your chance, Maggie.

01:31:07.598 --> 01:31:08.931
Ooh!

01:31:08.933 --> 01:31:11.203
I've been waiting
for this. Yeah.

01:31:11.434 --> 01:31:12.735
P, I'm gonna get Maggie.

01:31:12.737 --> 01:31:14.535
Get it, Charlotte. Get it.

01:31:14.537 --> 01:31:16.374
Okay!

01:31:16.741 --> 01:31:19.541
You see, I got all the ladies.
Let's see if I can get the angry one up.

01:31:19.543 --> 01:31:21.379
Angry Amy,
you gonna come have some fun?

01:31:24.615 --> 01:31:25.750
Come on, Yvonne.

01:31:26.549 --> 01:31:27.585
Come on, Yvonne.

01:31:27.817 --> 01:31:30.788
- Hey, hey, hey.
- No.

01:31:31.155 --> 01:31:32.421
Come on, Yvonne.

01:31:34.258 --> 01:31:35.727
Come on.

01:31:37.394 --> 01:31:39.263
Hey!

01:31:40.231 --> 01:31:42.267
- Oh!
- What?

01:31:42.566 --> 01:31:44.102
Ooh!

01:31:49.906 --> 01:31:52.977
Oh, shit! Hey!

01:31:54.245 --> 01:31:55.247
Wow.

01:31:57.415 --> 01:31:58.950
You can really dance.

01:31:59.582 --> 01:32:01.318
- No.
- You're good.

01:32:01.652 --> 01:32:03.151
Come on.

01:32:03.153 --> 01:32:05.154
No. Oh, God. I was always
a horrible dancer.

01:32:05.156 --> 01:32:06.358
I'm actually better now.

01:32:07.124 --> 01:32:09.760
This is an improvement
than what I used to do.

01:32:10.661 --> 01:32:11.796
Whoo!

01:32:21.304 --> 01:32:22.173
Whoo!

01:32:22.839 --> 01:32:25.843
Oh!

01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:28.545
Hello?

01:32:31.848 --> 01:32:33.784
No, no, no.
Don't lower the music.

01:32:34.552 --> 01:32:36.284
I'll call back whoever it is.

01:32:36.286 --> 01:32:37.321
It's Lily.

01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:40.659
Oh.

01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:44.295
Lily.

01:32:44.661 --> 01:32:45.696
Hello.

01:32:47.865 --> 01:32:50.969
Oh. We're just having a little party.
It's my birthday.

01:32:52.068 --> 01:32:55.072
It was.
And I was quite surprised.

01:32:58.875 --> 01:32:59.744
Oh?

01:33:02.513 --> 01:33:04.749
Well, let me...
Let me see if I...

01:33:05.482 --> 01:33:08.218
Do you think
I have Saturday free?

01:33:08.686 --> 01:33:09.554
Um...

01:33:10.353 --> 01:33:11.222
Mm-hmm.

01:33:12.223 --> 01:33:15.193
Yes, I think
that will work just fine.

01:33:15.593 --> 01:33:16.995
I... I'll see you then.

01:33:18.661 --> 01:33:20.261
Okay.

01:33:20.263 --> 01:33:21.165
Okay.

01:33:22.767 --> 01:33:23.668
Goodbye.

01:33:37.247 --> 01:33:38.116
Wow.

01:33:49.893 --> 01:33:52.396
Y... You don't think
that I should tell her?

01:33:53.196 --> 01:33:54.298
About the chair?

01:33:55.732 --> 01:33:58.235
I think you should focus on what
this woman may not have told you.

01:34:00.437 --> 01:34:02.439
God, it's been
so long since...

01:34:03.473 --> 01:34:04.541
I...

01:34:06.242 --> 01:34:07.644
I don't even know
what to wear.

01:34:08.278 --> 01:34:09.714
I'll tell you
what not to wear.

01:34:13.082 --> 01:34:15.152
- Really?
- Yeah, not on a date.

01:34:15.652 --> 01:34:17.285
Well, I...
I wouldn't call this a...

01:34:17.287 --> 01:34:18.423
It's a date.

01:34:23.427 --> 01:34:24.461
Happy birthday, man.

01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:27.098
Thanks.

01:34:35.973 --> 01:34:36.841
You ready?

01:34:37.741 --> 01:34:38.610
Yeah.

01:34:39.343 --> 01:34:41.579
All right,
the safe word is gonna be...

01:34:42.146 --> 01:34:43.148
"Verdi."

01:34:44.814 --> 01:34:47.449
I'm supposed to drop "Verdi"
into a sentence?

01:34:47.451 --> 01:34:48.917
- Yes.
- Huh.

01:34:48.919 --> 01:34:52.590
Like, "I gotta go.
You are Verdi ugly."

01:35:04.634 --> 01:35:06.970
I can see you mentally
tapping your leg, man.

01:35:08.205 --> 01:35:09.640
Relax, P. She gonna be here.

01:35:13.943 --> 01:35:15.013
Dell.

01:35:16.214 --> 01:35:18.283
Reach into my jacket pocket.
There should be an envelope.

01:35:24.722 --> 01:35:25.790
Open it.

01:35:35.299 --> 01:35:36.234
Well, uh...

01:35:37.034 --> 01:35:39.301
That is for
Untitled Number Zero,

01:35:39.303 --> 01:35:41.072
or What is Bravery?

01:35:41.906 --> 01:35:45.143
which is now proudly hung
in Carter's trophy room.

01:35:47.210 --> 01:35:49.012
- For real?
- For real.

01:35:49.379 --> 01:35:50.913
- For keeps?
- For keeps.

01:35:50.915 --> 01:35:52.082
For put it on your mama?

01:35:53.183 --> 01:35:54.550
"Put it on your mama"?

01:35:54.552 --> 01:35:55.687
Yo, P, this is...

01:35:58.155 --> 01:35:59.424
This is crazy, man.

01:36:00.357 --> 01:36:01.893
Hell, yeah, man!

01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:05.560
Hell yeah, P! Hell ye...

01:36:05.562 --> 01:36:06.864
That's my bad. My bad, man.

01:36:07.531 --> 01:36:08.566
That's me. My fault.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.736
Yo, P!

01:36:13.003 --> 01:36:14.438
This is it.
This is my business.

01:36:15.004 --> 01:36:15.906
I'm a artist.

01:36:16.907 --> 01:36:18.707
I can crank these suckers out
once a month.

01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:21.376
Fifty grand a pop. Over the
course of a year, that'd be...

01:36:21.378 --> 01:36:22.412
Fifty grand.

01:36:22.946 --> 01:36:24.946
That'd be 50 grand. Total.

01:36:24.948 --> 01:36:27.682
No, Dell. This is not
your business, Dell.

01:36:27.684 --> 01:36:30.385
- Wait, wait, but listen...
- Dell, no. This is seed money

01:36:30.387 --> 01:36:32.055
for the business
you do come up with.

01:36:39.396 --> 01:36:40.264
What?

01:36:41.031 --> 01:36:42.033
Is she here?

01:36:42.732 --> 01:36:43.901
I hope so.

01:36:45.869 --> 01:36:46.905
Hello, Philip.

01:36:48.772 --> 01:36:49.770
Hello.

01:36:52.409 --> 01:36:53.777
Oh, I'm sorry, um...

01:36:54.378 --> 01:36:55.977
- This is Dell.
- Oh, my bad.

01:36:55.979 --> 01:36:57.878
- He... He'll be joining us...
- Hello.

01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:59.082
- ...since, uh...
- What's up?

01:37:00.049 --> 01:37:01.084
Since...

01:37:03.387 --> 01:37:04.621
I meant to tell you.

01:37:06.055 --> 01:37:07.090
I knew.

01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:08.959
I saw a photo.

01:37:09.893 --> 01:37:11.796
I read an article.
I had to. Your...

01:37:12.795 --> 01:37:14.765
Your letters were too good.

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:17.669
Uh...

01:37:17.968 --> 01:37:19.804
You don't have to stay,
we're... we're fine.

01:37:21.138 --> 01:37:22.173
Uh-huh.

01:37:24.741 --> 01:37:25.610
Uh...

01:37:25.976 --> 01:37:27.010
Okay.

01:37:27.745 --> 01:37:30.011
Just, uh... Just have my guy
back by midnight.

01:37:32.249 --> 01:37:33.684
Midnight tomorrow
at the latest.

01:37:34.418 --> 01:37:35.519
- Okay.
- Be good, man.

01:37:37.021 --> 01:37:38.089
This is...

01:37:39.689 --> 01:37:42.192
Well, it's your city.
You make the best of it.

01:37:42.459 --> 01:37:43.494
Well, that's true.

01:37:43.994 --> 01:37:45.028
Always interesting.

01:37:45.329 --> 01:37:46.363
I'm never bored there.

01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:51.035
We're both talking about
Buffalo, New York, right?

01:37:51.501 --> 01:37:53.135
- It's a beautiful city.
- Okay.

01:37:53.137 --> 01:37:55.604
And the library I run
is a national treasure.

01:37:55.606 --> 01:37:57.638
Oh, and we did
just beat your Giants.

01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:00.042
Oh. I see.

01:38:00.044 --> 01:38:02.180
A football fan. You know,
that wasn't mentioned.

01:38:02.879 --> 01:38:04.881
- Well, I couldn't tell you everything.
- Mm-hmm.

01:38:36.924 --> 01:38:38.759
- The food here is brilliant, isn't it?
- Mmm.

01:38:38.761 --> 01:38:40.726
Although I hear
Buffalo has great wings.

01:38:43.298 --> 01:38:44.367
Oh, you...

01:38:44.767 --> 01:38:46.235
- you have something...
- Oh.

01:38:47.468 --> 01:38:48.568
There?

01:38:48.570 --> 01:38:49.605
No.

01:38:49.871 --> 01:38:51.104
- It's right there.
- Oh.

01:38:51.106 --> 01:38:52.037
Show-off.

01:38:52.039 --> 01:38:53.273
Oh. Would, um...

01:38:53.275 --> 01:38:54.911
- Would you like me to...
- No, no.

01:38:57.646 --> 01:38:59.115
I'm usually
pretty good at this.

01:39:03.886 --> 01:39:05.321
- Gone.
- Good.

01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:09.659
Ooh.

01:39:10.258 --> 01:39:11.627
Oh, that looks beautiful.

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:13.061
Thank you.

01:39:13.795 --> 01:39:17.296
So, tell me about your day.
Any day.

01:39:17.298 --> 01:39:18.732
Yesterday.

01:39:18.734 --> 01:39:20.332
- I wanna know everything.
- Yesterday...

01:39:20.334 --> 01:39:21.471
- Yeah.
- Ah.

01:39:22.103 --> 01:39:25.005
I skipped some meetings
to sit in on story hour.

01:39:25.007 --> 01:39:26.743
- Mmm.
- Do you know The Missing Piece?

01:39:27.575 --> 01:39:28.744
By Shel Silverstein?

01:39:29.244 --> 01:39:30.679
- Point to you.
- Oh, well...

01:39:31.245 --> 01:39:33.814
No, honestly, you should
take the point back.

01:39:33.816 --> 01:39:34.948
I never read it.

01:39:35.918 --> 01:39:37.317
Well, it's about a circle

01:39:37.319 --> 01:39:39.185
that's missing
this pie-shaped piece.

01:39:39.187 --> 01:39:40.921
And it goes on
a search for it.

01:39:40.923 --> 01:39:44.824
It tries big pieces,
small pieces, broken pieces,

01:39:44.826 --> 01:39:46.428
but none of them
let it roll right.

01:39:46.794 --> 01:39:47.829
And then, one day...

01:39:48.696 --> 01:39:49.766
there it is.

01:39:50.132 --> 01:39:51.167
The perfect piece.

01:39:52.368 --> 01:39:58.939
It picks it up and suddenly
it can go faster and faster.

01:39:58.941 --> 01:39:59.976
It's free.

01:40:03.846 --> 01:40:06.613
But after a while it realizes,

01:40:06.615 --> 01:40:09.315
now it can't sing

01:40:09.317 --> 01:40:12.788
or smell the flowers
or talk to its friends.

01:40:13.955 --> 01:40:15.324
It was going too fast.

01:40:21.295 --> 01:40:24.366
And in the end it decides to
leave the perfect piece behind.

01:40:25.667 --> 01:40:28.902
Ooh. That's pretty deep,
for a children's book.

01:40:28.904 --> 01:40:30.473
It is, isn't it?

01:40:31.906 --> 01:40:33.372
They can be scary, though.

01:40:33.374 --> 01:40:36.309
I remember reading
Grimm's Fairy Tales

01:40:36.311 --> 01:40:38.880
and it frightened me as a boy.

01:40:43.552 --> 01:40:45.254
Do I... Do I have something?

01:40:45.654 --> 01:40:46.720
- What? No.
- Did...

01:40:46.722 --> 01:40:48.257
Sorry.

01:40:50.659 --> 01:40:52.228
Oh, yes, please. Thank you.

01:41:01.370 --> 01:41:02.405
How are your dogs?

01:41:03.704 --> 01:41:06.374
Oh, they're fine.

01:41:11.713 --> 01:41:12.748
So...

01:41:14.883 --> 01:41:16.352
is this what you expected?

01:41:17.852 --> 01:41:18.887
In what way?

01:41:22.958 --> 01:41:24.192
Just, you know...

01:41:26.294 --> 01:41:28.530
is it what you expected?

01:41:32.234 --> 01:41:33.268
My therapist said...

01:41:36.972 --> 01:41:39.976
I swore I would never start a sentence
with those words, but, right...

01:41:44.646 --> 01:41:45.715
I think...

01:41:47.048 --> 01:41:48.383
what's happening here...

01:41:50.252 --> 01:41:51.784
is that this is what
she expected,

01:41:51.786 --> 01:41:52.655
not what I did.

01:41:54.588 --> 01:41:55.757
I thought I could...

01:41:56.458 --> 01:41:58.494
I mean, I knew that I could...

01:42:01.396 --> 01:42:03.462
I read up quite a bit.

01:42:03.464 --> 01:42:05.267
I... I talked to people.

01:42:07.268 --> 01:42:08.838
The librarian
did her homework.

01:42:13.174 --> 01:42:16.478
To answer your question,
and it is a fair question,

01:42:17.846 --> 01:42:19.248
it's not what I expected.

01:42:20.449 --> 01:42:21.450
It's a lot.

01:42:22.651 --> 01:42:25.988
I mean... What I mean is that
maybe Dell should have stayed.

01:42:26.989 --> 01:42:28.023
To help.

01:42:28.623 --> 01:42:31.690
You have to walk
before you can run, right?

01:42:31.692 --> 01:42:34.627
No. Oh. That was completely
the wrong thing to say.

01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:35.498
I...

01:42:36.431 --> 01:42:38.134
I need to stop talking.

01:42:41.503 --> 01:42:42.505
No, thank you.

01:42:45.473 --> 01:42:47.509
I'm... I'm tired.

01:42:48.610 --> 01:42:51.010
This is part of...

01:42:51.012 --> 01:42:53.012
You may have read about it.

01:42:53.014 --> 01:42:55.314
- Oh, no, please don't.
- I think perhaps you should call Dell.

01:42:55.316 --> 01:42:57.016
But the next course
is supposed to be the best...

01:42:57.018 --> 01:42:58.853
No. I'd... I'd like to leave.

01:43:02.156 --> 01:43:03.689
I shouldn't
have been so honest.

01:43:03.691 --> 01:43:06.127
No. I'm glad that you were.

01:43:10.298 --> 01:43:13.500
- I would like to be friends, if we...
- Please.

01:43:13.502 --> 01:43:15.705
- I don't want you to think that...
- No, just don't.

01:43:16.570 --> 01:43:18.137
Oh!

01:43:18.139 --> 01:43:19.208
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

01:43:22.076 --> 01:43:24.713
Oh, my God, did I burn you?

01:43:25.547 --> 01:43:28.314
- Did it burn you, sir?
- It's all right. Don't. Please, don't.

01:43:28.316 --> 01:43:30.519
I don't...
I can't feel anything.

01:43:31.218 --> 01:43:32.385
Apologies, sir.

01:43:32.387 --> 01:43:33.589
I don't feel anything.

01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:07.956
You know what, P?

01:44:09.356 --> 01:44:11.060
- That's her loss, man.
- Don't.

01:44:13.061 --> 01:44:15.297
- What do you mean, "Don't"?
- Don't patronize me.

01:44:17.264 --> 01:44:19.768
This is exactly why
I didn't wanna speak to her.

01:44:23.137 --> 01:44:25.240
You, uh...
You need anything else?

01:44:26.141 --> 01:44:27.243
Oh, are we done?

01:44:28.444 --> 01:44:30.780
You don't wanna have this
conversation, so we're done?

01:44:31.745 --> 01:44:34.282
P, do you know how many times
I've been rejected by women?

01:44:34.816 --> 01:44:36.416
It happens, all right?

01:44:36.418 --> 01:44:38.051
You fall off the horse,
you get up, get back on.

01:44:38.053 --> 01:44:39.955
Yeah, but I can't
ride a horse, so...

01:44:40.621 --> 01:44:41.723
Here we go.

01:44:42.257 --> 01:44:43.292
You know what?

01:44:43.758 --> 01:44:45.327
This... This isn't working.

01:44:46.328 --> 01:44:48.998
- You're tired, man.
- Yeah, I'm tired. I'm tired of this.

01:44:49.630 --> 01:44:50.900
I never should've hired you.

01:44:52.066 --> 01:44:54.399
You're the least
qualified applicant

01:44:54.401 --> 01:44:55.835
by a factor of 100.

01:44:55.837 --> 01:44:56.972
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:44:58.205 --> 01:45:00.607
What? You want me to go back
and get one of those eggheads?

01:45:00.609 --> 01:45:02.111
'Cause I'm still here,
aren't I?

01:45:02.444 --> 01:45:04.146
I think I was
the most qualified.

01:45:05.012 --> 01:45:08.417
I can't believe that you
talked me into seeing her.

01:45:09.116 --> 01:45:10.351
I called her.

01:45:10.919 --> 01:45:13.252
- That's it. That's all I did.
- Mm-hmm.

01:45:13.254 --> 01:45:15.924
I was gonna hang up the phone.
You chose to speak to her.

01:45:16.423 --> 01:45:17.926
I didn't hold a gun
up to your head.

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:19.692
Oh. Well, although,

01:45:19.694 --> 01:45:21.493
I gather you've had some
experience doing that.

01:45:21.495 --> 01:45:22.964
Given your
concealed weapon charge.

01:45:24.532 --> 01:45:26.832
- So, we're going back to my record, now?
- You know what?

01:45:26.834 --> 01:45:30.435
I wanted to engage Lily
on my terms.

01:45:30.437 --> 01:45:31.673
And you took that from me.

01:45:32.106 --> 01:45:34.776
I took it?
'Cause I'm a thief, right?

01:45:35.776 --> 01:45:36.811
Well, aren't you?

01:45:37.611 --> 01:45:39.681
You know, that's my past
and I will own that.

01:45:40.182 --> 01:45:42.451
I got no problem with that.
But I'm moving forward.

01:45:42.717 --> 01:45:45.551
- What about you, P? Hmm?
- Yeah, I'm moving forward too.

01:45:45.553 --> 01:45:46.621
- Are you?
- Yeah.

01:45:47.321 --> 01:45:48.324
With this.

01:45:48.856 --> 01:45:50.359
Get out. You're fired.

01:45:52.294 --> 01:45:53.458
I'm what?

01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:55.364
I'm letting you go. All right?

01:46:15.316 --> 01:46:18.219
Defense, man. Defense.

01:46:23.490 --> 01:46:24.359
Yo.

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:26.562
Welcome home, man.

01:46:56.057 --> 01:46:57.059
Philip.

01:46:58.459 --> 01:46:59.527
This is Jason.

01:47:01.129 --> 01:47:02.865
He's gonna be your new carer.

01:47:17.812 --> 01:47:19.381
Food, Mr. LaCasse?

01:47:59.754 --> 01:48:00.656
Wow.

01:48:36.124 --> 01:48:37.159
It's nice.

01:48:37.558 --> 01:48:38.459
Big.

01:48:40.495 --> 01:48:41.997
Aren't you gonna come inside?

01:48:43.365 --> 01:48:44.400
Not right now.

01:48:45.133 --> 01:48:46.468
I'll see you tomorrow, though.

01:48:47.067 --> 01:48:48.570
I'll pick you up from school.

01:48:49.036 --> 01:48:50.705
If that's okay.

01:48:53.407 --> 01:48:54.343
Cool.

01:49:25.106 --> 01:49:28.274
Hey, Dell. I need you
to check on the new guy.

01:49:28.276 --> 01:49:29.545
Okay, I'm on it.

01:49:35.048 --> 01:49:37.518
Make sure you turn
the supports inward, okay?

01:49:38.085 --> 01:49:39.887
That way,
they cradle the patient's arm.

01:49:40.454 --> 01:49:41.289
Exactly.

01:49:41.722 --> 01:49:43.057
How fast do they go?

01:49:43.691 --> 01:49:46.195
You'd be surprised.

01:49:54.201 --> 01:49:55.471
He's bad, Dell.

01:49:56.437 --> 01:49:59.407
He won't listen to anyone.
He might listen to you.

01:50:00.708 --> 01:50:01.777
Where's Yvonne?

01:50:02.110 --> 01:50:03.277
She left.

01:50:04.145 --> 01:50:05.313
Yvonne left?

01:50:06.414 --> 01:50:07.983
He's pushing everybody away.

01:50:17.758 --> 01:50:18.627
You all set?

01:50:20.261 --> 01:50:21.295
Okay, cool.

01:50:43.017 --> 01:50:45.287
Some animal has collapsed
on your face, Phil.

01:50:46.687 --> 01:50:48.488
I don't know
if you can feel it,

01:50:48.490 --> 01:50:50.092
but I'm gonna try
and move 'em.

01:50:50.959 --> 01:50:52.594
I just need you to hold still.

01:50:57.965 --> 01:50:59.468
Oh, no, that's a beard.

01:51:00.802 --> 01:51:02.004
This is intentional?

01:51:07.542 --> 01:51:08.843
You wanna go for a drive?

01:51:45.413 --> 01:51:46.746
All right.
So, we radioed ahead.

01:51:46.748 --> 01:51:48.314
They're comin' out
with a gurney.

01:51:48.316 --> 01:51:50.149
- He's gonna be fine.
- Appreciate you, man.

01:51:56.490 --> 01:51:57.391
What now?

01:51:59.660 --> 01:52:01.496
- Oh, shit.
- Go, go, go!

01:52:29.389 --> 01:52:30.558
Pretty enough to paint?

01:52:33.861 --> 01:52:36.465
I could see if Carter's
interested in a commission.

01:52:42.704 --> 01:52:45.040
Playlist, Phil's Jam.

01:52:49.643 --> 01:52:52.144
- No, come on, P. No, I'm serious, man.
- No. Just...

01:52:52.146 --> 01:52:53.945
- I'm not in the mood to hear it.
- ...give it a moment.

01:52:53.947 --> 01:52:56.317
- I'm not in the mood, though.
- Just give it a moment.

01:53:06.393 --> 01:53:07.495
Wait, who is this?

01:53:08.562 --> 01:53:09.764
That's the queen.

01:53:10.431 --> 01:53:13.134
My queen? That's Aretha?

01:53:13.735 --> 01:53:14.636
Mm-hmm.

01:53:15.703 --> 01:53:17.673
She filled in for Pavarotti
once at the Grammys.

01:53:21.676 --> 01:53:23.844
- Queen make everything better.
- Mm-hmm.

01:53:41.928 --> 01:53:43.831
Ah. It's lovely.

01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:46.832
Mmm.

01:53:50.338 --> 01:53:51.440
You must be Philip.

01:53:52.306 --> 01:53:53.674
- Yes.
- You ready?

01:53:54.676 --> 01:53:55.611
Ready?

01:53:57.344 --> 01:53:59.013
What did you do?

01:54:10.290 --> 01:54:11.159
You Dell?

01:54:13.494 --> 01:54:14.362
No.

01:54:14.962 --> 01:54:16.397
Yes, he is!

01:54:16.897 --> 01:54:19.200
No. No, I'm not.
I'm doing that, man.

01:54:19.534 --> 01:54:21.536
What you...
You trying to kill me?

01:54:21.869 --> 01:54:23.836

01:54:23.838 --> 01:54:25.741
I'm not doing that, P. No.

01:54:31.145 --> 01:54:33.481
- Keep going. Keep going.
- Whoo!

01:54:36.551 --> 01:54:38.186
Whoo-hoo!

01:54:39.219 --> 01:54:41.987
Yeah. Hey, man, I... I'm not gonna do it.

01:54:41.989 --> 01:54:44.026
- We got this.
- Nah. No, we don't.

01:54:44.258 --> 01:54:46.926
Keep running, Dell!
Keep running, Dell! Run, Dell!

01:54:46.928 --> 01:54:49.494
Run, Dell! Run, run!
Keep running, Dell!

01:54:49.496 --> 01:54:51.329
- Whoa!
- Come on, Dell!

01:54:51.331 --> 01:54:54.035
Come on, Dell. Go like this...

01:54:55.169 --> 01:54:57.168
- You can let go. Grab those handles.
- Oh, shit!

01:54:57.170 --> 01:54:59.840
- Oh! Whoa!
- We're looking good.

01:55:00.374 --> 01:55:01.243
Good.

01:55:01.776 --> 01:55:03.211
Yo, control it, man!

01:55:03.945 --> 01:55:04.880
Control it!

01:55:07.682 --> 01:55:08.617
Hey, Dell!

01:55:10.785 --> 01:55:12.220
Just relax!

01:55:12.853 --> 01:55:14.255
I am relaxed!

01:55:14.722 --> 01:55:16.188
This is me being relaxed!

01:55:35.375 --> 01:55:36.244
Dell.

01:55:37.245 --> 01:55:38.613
Thank you!

01:55:40.714 --> 01:55:42.316
How are you doing?

01:55:42.717 --> 01:55:44.453
Yo, it's amazing, man!

01:55:46.654 --> 01:55:48.423
I can't believe I'm flying!

01:55:51.959 --> 01:55:53.962
Whoo!

01:55:54.928 --> 01:55:58.799
Yeah!

01:56:03.004 --> 01:56:04.072
Thank you.

01:56:04.338 --> 01:56:06.641
Oh, man, look at this.

01:56:07.508 --> 01:56:10.011
- Ooh!
- Oh, yeah, that's pretty.

01:56:11.611 --> 01:56:12.813
Oh, God.

01:56:15.850 --> 01:56:16.752
Hey,

01:56:17.317 --> 01:56:18.753
it's time to let the beard go.

01:56:19.419 --> 01:56:20.288
Why?

01:56:20.922 --> 01:56:22.290
Just trust me on this one.

01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:30.699
Talk to me.

01:56:30.998 --> 01:56:32.363
Talk to me.

01:56:32.365 --> 01:56:33.698
I look... I look like a...

01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:34.802
A porn star.

01:56:35.303 --> 01:56:37.036
- Oh, that's the one.
- Let me see.

01:56:37.038 --> 01:56:39.141
- Oh, this is the one right here.
- Let me see.

01:56:43.044 --> 01:56:44.710
- That's the one.
- I'm badass!

01:56:44.712 --> 01:56:46.714
Yeah, I was tired of you
looking like a bitch.

01:56:47.013 --> 01:56:49.381
- No. No, that's not it.
- Hello, there.

01:56:49.383 --> 01:56:50.986
- I know what to do. Lemme see.
- I'm very...

01:56:51.384 --> 01:56:52.618
Is it Chaplin?

01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:53.551
No.

01:56:53.553 --> 01:56:54.552
It's Charlie Chaplin.

01:56:54.554 --> 01:56:55.723
No, no, no!

01:57:01.862 --> 01:57:03.464
Oh, that is terrible.

01:57:06.066 --> 01:57:08.132
- Oh, there he is.
- Yeah.

01:57:08.134 --> 01:57:09.702
- Who's that guy?
- I don't know.

01:57:09.704 --> 01:57:11.039
I haven't seen him in a while.

01:57:14.307 --> 01:57:15.975
Oh!

01:57:15.977 --> 01:57:17.408
- Thanks for the warning.
- I'm sorry I didn't see it.

01:57:21.315 --> 01:57:23.381
All right. How you feeling, P?

01:57:23.383 --> 01:57:24.252
Good.

01:57:24.552 --> 01:57:26.087
Very good.

01:57:27.221 --> 01:57:29.758
Well, hold on, 'cause the best
is yet to come.

01:58:03.958 --> 01:58:05.026
