20:09.275 --> 20:10.575
           - You okay?

20:10.677 --> 20:14.212
          - Yeah, yeah.
    David's just protective.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.980
             - Hmm.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.389
       - Babe, I'm sorry.

20:25.491 --> 20:26.857
 I'm really tired and stressed.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.060
   And I have to get this done
      then get some sleep.

20:29.162 --> 20:31.162
         - Are you sure?

20:31.264 --> 20:34.599
        - Seriously, Kay,
         I'm exhausted.

20:34.701 --> 20:37.068
           Just let me
      finish this, please?

20:41.474 --> 20:43.174
             - Okay.

20:46.579 --> 20:50.147
         Maybe tomorrow
        after date night?

20:51.050 --> 20:53.851
       - Yeah, definitely.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.427
            Oh, God.

21:03.529 --> 21:06.764
      I've made you resort
   to scheduling sex with me?

21:06.866 --> 21:09.867
     - Hey, whatever works.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.372
           Goodnight.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.173
         - 'Night, babe.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.852
      - Hey, I'm sorry too.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.720
       For not asking you
    about David staying here.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.289
       - Oh, that's okay.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.557
   I mean, why would you know
      there was a problem?

21:33.660 --> 21:36.861
      - Is there a problem?

21:38.097 --> 21:39.363
       Is there something
    going on between you two

21:39.465 --> 21:41.499
      I should know about?

21:41.601 --> 21:43.734
              - No.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.073
           We're good.

22:02.622 --> 22:07.191
 sweep out wide,

22:07.293 --> 22:09.994
       <i> down rise, exhale.</i>

22:10.096 --> 22:13.364
 <i> And strong down to the heart.</i>

22:13.466 --> 22:16.067
     <i> Again, just like that.</i>

22:16.169 --> 22:18.402
      <i> Big breath. Inhale.</i>

22:18.504 --> 22:19.837
        <i> Exhale coming...</i>
              - Oh!

22:19.939 --> 22:21.372
          - Hey, sorry.
              - Hi.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.474
   - I just came to ask where
  you like to keep the skillet.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.743
   - Oh, just under the stove
     in that little drawer.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.011
            - Right.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.914
     I like that instructor.
          She's great.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.849
         - You do yoga?

22:31.951 --> 22:33.751
     - Yeah, and meditation.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.152
        Gotta stay sane.

22:35.254 --> 22:36.587
          [ chuckles ]

22:36.689 --> 22:38.856
     Anyways, it looks like
     it's treating you well.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.992
            - Thanks.
 Glad somebody finally noticed.

22:42.095 --> 22:44.729
    I mean, not to sound like
    an idiot, but, you know.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.230
      You work all hard and
      finally get in shape,

22:46.332 --> 22:47.932
     and then nobody cares.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.568
  Nobody's come to my door with
  a congrats on the abs trophy.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.037
        - Well, I'm sure
      Eric appreciates it.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.905
             - Sure.

22:55.007 --> 22:59.210
    - As in you look healthy
     and relaxed, you know.

22:59.312 --> 23:01.479
      - Yoga's a liar then.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.080
      Because I don't think
    I'm ever really relaxed.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.648
            - Right.

23:04.751 --> 23:07.318
     Well, you've got a lot
      on your plate, so...

23:07.420 --> 23:08.886
 Anyways, I made you a smoothie

23:08.988 --> 23:10.421
     and it's in the fridge
      for when you're done.

23:10.523 --> 23:11.922
       - You really don't
        have to do that.

23:12.024 --> 23:14.759
      - It's not a problem.
    Just trying to help out.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.861
        Anyways, I'll get
        outta your hair.

23:16.963 --> 23:18.562
             - Hey.
             - Hmm?

23:18.631 --> 23:21.532
 - I was gonna run some errands
  and head over to school soon.

23:21.634 --> 23:24.402
        Wanna come with?
        Keep me company?

23:26.239 --> 23:28.572
       - Yeah, sure, yeah.

23:28.674 --> 23:31.842
    It would probably be good
 for me to get out of the house

23:31.944 --> 23:34.111
 and see the town a little bit.

23:34.213 --> 23:36.647
       See where my niece
       hangs out all day.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.682
         - Let me shower
       and eat real quick.

23:38.785 --> 23:41.118
          - All right.
         Awesome sauce.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.654
        - Awesome sauce?

23:43.756 --> 23:46.056
 - I guess Laura's been rubbing
     off on me a little bit.

23:46.159 --> 23:48.793
    - I don't think teens say
     awesome sauce anymore.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.428
              - No?
            - Mm-mmm.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.962
          - Cool beans?
        Do they say that?

23:52.064 --> 23:53.130
           [ laughs ]
              - No.

23:53.232 --> 23:56.200
      - I don't know then.

24:02.708 --> 24:05.009
   - Yeah, just right in here.
            - Great.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.244
              - Oh.
    - Oh, good. You're here!

24:07.346 --> 24:09.747
      We were just talking
     about how to, um... hi.

24:09.849 --> 24:10.881
           Who's this?

24:12.652 --> 24:14.318
  Just dropped in for a visit.

24:14.420 --> 24:15.519
           David, Liz,
     a good friend of mine.

24:15.621 --> 24:16.887
              - Hi.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.889
 - And Fran, a fellow PTA member
     and hardworking parent.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.758
  - David, so nice to meet you.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.660
        I didn't realize
    that Eric had a brother.

24:22.762 --> 24:25.162
     - Yeah. He doesn't talk
         about me much.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.263
   I guess I'm pretty boring.

24:26.365 --> 24:27.465
           [ laughs ]

24:27.567 --> 24:29.467
          - Seem pretty
       interesting to me.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.536
      - Uh, David's offered
       to help in any way

24:32.638 --> 24:33.671
   he can with the fundraiser.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.406
         - Oh, thank you
        very much, David.

24:35.508 --> 24:38.843
       I know that I could
 definitely use some good help.

24:40.413 --> 24:43.280
          - Okay, then.
    So what's on the agenda?

24:44.817 --> 24:47.985
        - I don't get it.
     What are you afraid of?

24:48.087 --> 24:50.788
      - I'm just not ready
      to go there yet, Ron.

24:53.493 --> 24:57.261
      - Oh, hey, here comes
    your mom with some dude.

24:58.331 --> 25:00.631
       - That's my uncle.

25:00.733 --> 25:03.801
         - Hey, sweetie.
           - Hey, Mom.

25:03.903 --> 25:06.070
      Uncle David, what are
         you doing here?

25:06.172 --> 25:08.205
    - I figured I'd help your
   mom out with some errands.

25:08.307 --> 25:09.740
  She's got a lot on her plate.

25:09.842 --> 25:13.043
       - Oh, yeah, between
   doing yoga and watching TV.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.713
  - That's what you think I do?

25:15.815 --> 25:18.148
     - Your mom prepped all
       this week's meals.

25:18.251 --> 25:20.150
     She cleaned the house.

25:20.253 --> 25:22.853
    Swung by the DMV and took
     the car into the shop.

25:22.955 --> 25:26.490
     She got very scary with
     the teller at the bank

25:26.592 --> 25:28.225
  and planned your fundraiser.

25:28.327 --> 25:30.761
    That's just this morning.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.696
     You don't even realize
    everything that she does

25:32.798 --> 25:34.532
       because she hardly
         breaks a sweat.

25:34.634 --> 25:37.334
       I mean, your mom's
      a pretty groovy gal.

25:37.436 --> 25:38.903
           [ laughs ]

25:39.005 --> 25:40.371
            - Groovy.

25:40.473 --> 25:42.306
      - Sorry. Who are you?

25:42.408 --> 25:43.841
      - I'm her boyfriend.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.878
 - Well, just meet us by the car
    when you're ready, okay?

25:47.980 --> 25:49.914
      - Yeah, okay, I'll be
       there in a minute.

25:50.016 --> 25:50.915
       - Nice to meet you.

25:51.017 --> 25:53.684
      - Yeah. Take it easy,
           Uncle Dave.

25:58.357 --> 26:01.258
       That's your uncle?

26:01.360 --> 26:03.294
          What a cuck.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.829
  - He's actually really cool.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.398
       - Oh, yeah, right.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.667
      Well, can he do this?

26:12.238 --> 26:14.004
          Aw, damn it!

26:14.106 --> 26:16.707
   - And why would he want to?

26:16.809 --> 26:18.409
      You know, it's a good
       thing you're cute.

26:18.511 --> 26:20.377
  Otherwise, I'd dump you just
  for knowing the word "cuck".

26:20.479 --> 26:21.979
        - I'm cute, huh?

26:22.081 --> 26:24.381
          [ chuckles ]

26:24.483 --> 26:26.951
    Hey, give me a real one.

26:36.128 --> 26:38.262
       - So how did Laura
     end up dating that guy?

26:38.364 --> 26:42.933
- Oh, she says he's some sort of
 music prodigy and idiot savant.

26:43.035 --> 26:45.302
             - Hmm.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.004
        - Damn it, Eric!

26:47.106 --> 26:48.539
         - What's wrong?

26:48.641 --> 26:51.075
 - Well, he refuses to pay full
    price for this repairman

26:51.177 --> 26:53.544
    and he only wants to use
 someone his friend recommends.

26:53.646 --> 26:55.012
     But he keeps forgetting
      to ask for the number

26:55.114 --> 26:57.081
       and this is really
       fascinating for you

26:57.183 --> 26:58.916
     and not boring at all.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.943
 -<i> If you notice water dripping</i>
        <i> from your line,</i>

27:26.045 --> 27:28.779
      <i> you can save time by</i>
    <i> tightening it yourself.</i>

27:28.881 --> 27:31.181
   <i> To complete this process,</i>
  <i> you'll need a pair of pliers</i>

  <i> or a pair of channel locks.</i>

27:32.785 --> 27:33.884

         <i> safety first.</i>

27:38.290 --> 27:39.957
            - There!

27:43.095 --> 27:44.795
              Yeah!

27:44.897 --> 27:47.164
               Oh!

27:50.102 --> 27:51.669
            - Uh-oh.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.044
       - Thanks. I, um...

28:00.146 --> 28:02.379
        I obviously have
   no idea of what I'm doing.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.048
 - I'm pretty sure I can fix it.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.783
     I've always been a DIY
           kind of guy

28:05.885 --> 28:08.185
     so Eric could focus on
      being the smart one.

28:09.388 --> 28:10.421
          - Thank you.

28:10.523 --> 28:11.822
             - Yeah.

28:16.996 --> 28:20.864
   - Well, I should call Eric
      and tell him we don't

28:20.966 --> 28:22.399
  need the repair guy anymore.

28:22.501 --> 28:25.002
        - Yeah, you don't
        need him anymore.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.857
         I don't get it.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.093
     I don't understand how
      you get it so easily.

28:49.195 --> 28:50.527
        - I like numbers.

28:50.629 --> 28:52.162
          - Apparently.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.398
   Now can we wrap this up and
    watch "Goonies" already?

28:54.500 --> 28:56.567
          - Okay, okay.
       Just a couple more.

29:20.559 --> 29:23.393
   - Wow, you clean up nicely.

29:23.496 --> 29:24.895
          - Thank you.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.764
      - She always gets all
    dolled up for date night.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.232
     Which I don't know why.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.134
       You guys always go
     to the same restaurant

29:30.236 --> 29:31.468
      and then the movies.

29:31.570 --> 29:32.503
             Boring.

29:32.605 --> 29:33.937
   - Hey, be nice to your mom.

29:34.039 --> 29:35.205
      - When you don't have
     very many opportunities

29:35.307 --> 29:37.040
  to look nice, you find them.

29:37.143 --> 29:40.077
       - Well, you do look
       really pretty, Mom.

29:40.179 --> 29:41.779
          - Thank you.

29:41.881 --> 29:44.748
      We'd better hurry up,
     or we're gonna be late.

29:52.525 --> 29:55.993
  - So how often is date night?

29:56.095 --> 29:58.395
         - Barely ever.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.430
  Okay, so when you're solving
    for an unknown equation,

30:00.533 --> 30:02.800
   you have to start with what
      you already do know.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.669
            - Right.

30:05.771 --> 30:07.604
          - Seriously?

30:10.810 --> 30:12.609
 Why didn't you call me sooner?
