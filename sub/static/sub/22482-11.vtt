WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:03.104
Previously on Mom...
Santa Cruz is only

00:03.137 --> 00:05.773
a three hour
and 12 minute drive.

00:05.806 --> 00:08.676
Do you think we should try
the long

00:08.709 --> 00:10.144
I'm game.

00:10.178 --> 00:12.613
Don't I know you from that time
we slept together?

00:12.646 --> 00:15.316
It's kind of a bad time.
I-I really got to study.

00:18.286 --> 00:21.055
This isn't just
hooking up anymore.

00:21.089 --> 00:26.127
Cooper, look... I just don't
have the same feelings for you.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.528
I just don't get it, Christy.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.198
I mean, it would be one thing
if there was another guy.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.532
Oh! There is.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.467
There's totally another guy.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.106
I guess I want to be
with the other guy.

00:38.139 --> 00:41.609
Wow, Christy's driving down
to Santa Cruz to see Patrick.

00:41.642 --> 00:44.212
* I'm so excited

00:44.245 --> 00:47.248
* And I just can't hide it

00:47.281 --> 00:51.352
* I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know I want you *

00:51.385 --> 00:53.387
* I want you.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.556
Come on, Bonnie!

00:55.589 --> 00:57.658
This wedding starts at 3:00.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.527
You ready?
Unfortunately,

00:59.560 --> 01:01.729
yes.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.432
Wow. You look...

01:04.465 --> 01:07.301
I know.
"Ho, ho, ho, Green Giant."

01:07.335 --> 01:09.803
How'd you get roped into this?

01:09.837 --> 01:11.605
I made the mistake
of being nice.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.208
Judy's in our meeting. One time
I told her to hang in there.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.809
Next thing I know,
I'm her emergency contact

01:15.843 --> 01:17.645
and a bridesmaid.

01:17.678 --> 01:20.614
Wait a minute. I put on a tie
for a woman you barely know?

01:20.648 --> 01:22.316
You want to trade?

01:23.517 --> 01:25.253
How did Christy get out of this?

01:25.286 --> 01:26.587
Judy hates her.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.821
They shared the coffee
commitment once,

01:27.855 --> 01:29.723
and it almost
led to a fistfight.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.260
Stupid Marjorie broke it up.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.628
Have you seen my pearl earrings?

01:34.662 --> 01:36.797
I've never noticed earrings
in my entire life.

01:38.466 --> 01:40.268
Except for the guy
at my Starbucks.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.470
He's got, like, a piece
of driftwood in there.

01:46.307 --> 01:47.908
Hey, Mom.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.877
Hi. Do you know
where my pearl earrings are?

01:49.910 --> 01:51.579
No idea.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.214
And again, they're not pearls.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.683
They're just
white plastic beads.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.586
Yeah, well, now I have no
earrings to wear to the wedding.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.821
I've seen that dress.
You don't need earrings.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.491
You need a rim of salt
around your head.

02:03.524 --> 02:06.294
How's it going with Patrick?

02:06.327 --> 02:09.330
It's not. I've been stuck
in traffic for hours.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.665
I'm close to peeing
in my Big Gulp.

02:11.699 --> 02:14.802
If you do, make sure
you dump it out the window.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.637
I had a bad experience once.

02:19.273 --> 02:22.276
After all this, I just hope
he's home when I get there.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.911
You didn't call first?

02:23.944 --> 02:26.480
No! You don't call ahead

02:26.514 --> 02:28.816
when you're about to make
a big romantic gesture.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.352
Have you never seen
a Sandra Bullock movie?

02:31.385 --> 02:33.554
Not willingly, no.

02:33.587 --> 02:38.459
You don't call before you run to
the airport to stop the plane,

02:38.492 --> 02:40.461
or bang on the church window,

02:40.494 --> 02:44.598
or go back in time
to make sure your parents kiss.

02:44.632 --> 02:47.167
You just do it.

02:48.236 --> 02:50.638
Mom

02:50.671 --> 02:52.806
Damn it.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.209
If you're there,
I can't hear you.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.610
Mom?

02:56.644 --> 02:58.279
I'm pretending
I can't hear her.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.647
It drives her crazy.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.317
Mom?

03:03.351 --> 03:05.219
Mom!

03:05.253 --> 03:06.554
Mom?!

03:06.587 --> 03:08.889
Mom?!

03:16.730 --> 03:19.567
Oh, my God, he isn't here?

03:19.600 --> 03:22.403
Oh, my God,
what have I done?

03:32.913 --> 03:36.384
Oh, Lucy. Lucy girl.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.651
Christy?

03:37.685 --> 03:39.253
Hi.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.688
:
Hi.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.490
Uh... what are you doing?

03:42.523 --> 03:44.992
Making a big romantic gesture.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.828
On my roses?

03:49.563 --> 03:50.964
Patrick, I want to be with you.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.800
Well, I want
to be with you, too.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.368
Great.
I'll tell you what.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.437
Um, when you're done,
come on inside.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.805
We'll have a little snack,

03:57.838 --> 04:00.774
and we'll erase
the security video together.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.279
I don't think your dog likes me.

04:05.313 --> 04:07.281
Well, you are on her spot.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.883
Come on, Lucy.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.919
*

04:29.069 --> 04:31.305
Have you looked
at this schedule?

04:31.339 --> 04:33.907
The service is
an hour and a half.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.977
It's a full Mass with Communion,
a "Blessing of the People."

04:37.010 --> 04:39.380
What the hell is that?

04:39.413 --> 04:41.782
It's when I whisper "Hail,
Satan" under my breath.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.617
This is gonna be torture.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.919
Oh, relax. We'll just
make out in the back row.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.855
Sweetheart,
you're in the ceremony.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.657
Didn't you go to the rehearsal?

04:49.690 --> 04:52.926
Rehearsal?
I'm not hosting SNL.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.663
Hey, when we finally do this,
I say we knock it out

04:55.696 --> 04:57.030
at City Hall, grab some Chinese,

04:57.064 --> 04:59.032
and we're on a plane to Hawaii
by sundown.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.068
See, that is why
I am marrying you.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.972
Some day.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.675
Aw, geez, after the ceremony,

05:07.708 --> 05:09.877
there's a 45-minute drive
to the reception?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.812
This better be an open bar.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.881
Yeah, about that...

05:13.914 --> 05:15.916
Hmm, it's a dry wedding.

05:15.949 --> 05:19.086
No alcohol?
Why didn't you tell me?

05:19.119 --> 05:20.654
Same reason
you don't tell a baby

05:20.688 --> 05:21.989
he's about to be circumcised.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.638
Does she always do that?

05:37.671 --> 05:39.106
Uh, well,
it's been a long time

05:39.139 --> 05:41.409
since she's seen me
kissing anyone but her.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.548
I have been waiting so
long to do this with you.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.450
And by "this,"
I mean...

05:49.483 --> 05:50.884
more than this.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.153
Like a naked
version of this.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.922
Ooh, that sounds fun.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.961
Maybe without
Big Eyes.
Lucy,

06:00.994 --> 06:02.496
squirrel in the back
of the house!

06:04.565 --> 06:06.700
There's no squirrels.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.903
Mmm.
Oh. Mmm.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.572
Mmm.
Oh.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.841
I can't go back
any farther.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.410
There's, like, nine
pillows behind me.

06:16.444 --> 06:19.012
Uh, yeah, well, uh,
my ex-wife is a decorator,

06:19.046 --> 06:21.649
and she's really
into throw pillows.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.016
And art and furniture.

06:23.050 --> 06:26.420
Pretty much everything
in the house that's not me.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.155
Mmm.

06:30.057 --> 06:33.861
So, what you're saying is your
ex-wife is kind of everywhere.

06:36.163 --> 06:39.833
Yeah. I never really
thought about that.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.803
It's just that
it's our first time,

06:42.836 --> 06:44.938
and I want it
to be perfect.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.574
You know what?

06:46.607 --> 06:48.742
I got a surprise
for y now.

06:48.776 --> 06:52.646
How about you and me find
a really nice hotel room?

06:52.680 --> 06:54.848
Oh, my God, hotel sex?

06:54.882 --> 06:57.184
That's the best kind
of sex there is.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.655
I know.
Such a beautiful service.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.591
So moving.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.726
I'll see you at the reception.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.096
Oh, my God, that
was endless.

07:09.129 --> 07:12.466
The standing up,
the sitting down.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.835
That guy walking around
throwing smoke at people.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.471
And if I have to wait
in line for a cracker,

07:17.505 --> 07:20.741
would it kill 'em to spray
a little cheese on it?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.042
I don't know. I thought

07:22.075 --> 07:23.777
the children's choir
was kind of nice.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.145
Really? 'Cause I was hoping

07:25.178 --> 07:27.114
a bigger choir would come
and beat 'em up.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.917
Come on. They were singing
about love in Italian.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.052
Oh, they could have been
singing about linguine.

07:32.085 --> 07:35.022
You don't know.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.524
Are your eyes red?

07:37.925 --> 07:39.793
Please tell me
you weren't crying.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.496
No. Just...
the whole thing got to me

07:42.530 --> 07:44.031
a little more
than I thought it would.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.834
When they took
their two little candles

07:46.867 --> 07:50.203
and lit the one big candle.

07:50.237 --> 07:54.007
They're the one big candle now.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.076
Sorry, I didn't notice.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.845
At that point, I was trying

07:57.878 --> 08:01.849
to slice my Spanx open
with a nail clipper.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.216
Hey, would it be so terrible

08:03.250 --> 08:05.152
if we did the candle thing
at our wedding?

08:05.185 --> 08:06.920
Maybe we even get married
in a church.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.622
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:08.656 --> 08:11.024
What happened to City Hall,
Chinese food, Hawaii?

08:11.058 --> 08:14.261
I don't know. Maybe we should
do something more traditional.

08:14.294 --> 08:18.832
The only reason I am not
driving head-on into traffic

08:18.866 --> 08:21.168
is I don't want to
die in this dress.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.207
So this room's
working for you.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.309
Oh, yeah.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.983
Was that you?

08:36.016 --> 08:38.786
Not yet.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.289
MAN :
Oh, God, yes.

08:44.324 --> 08:47.160
Still not me.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.229
You know what? I think
we've got some neighbors.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.699
Why don't we try
to tune 'em out?

08:53.033 --> 08:55.535
(thudding continues,
bed squeaking rhythmically)

08:57.004 --> 08:58.639
WOMAN :
Oh!

09:14.955 --> 09:18.058
Well, that guy has
a gear I don't have.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.795
I'm really sorry.

09:21.829 --> 09:24.331
No, no, no, no, no.
I get it. I get it.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.900
That second girl
got pretty loud.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.103
So where to now?

09:30.137 --> 09:33.774
Well, I'm gonna take us
to my favorite beach.

09:33.807 --> 09:37.044
It's really secluded
and very romantic.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.681
Oh. The beach.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.383
I think you mean,
"Oh, the beach!"

09:43.416 --> 09:45.052
No, I-I love the beach.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.755
I just don't love
the beach naked.
Ah.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.223
Women are kind of
like English muffins.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.793
We have a lot
of nooks and crannies.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.898
What's going on?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.970
Well,
Christy, um...

10:03.003 --> 10:04.938
I just got to ask.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.107
Are you having
second thoughts about this?

10:07.140 --> 10:08.842
What? No.
No, no, no.

10:08.876 --> 10:11.044
It-it's okay,
because i-if you're not

10:11.078 --> 10:13.380
feeling right about it,
then we can wait.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.182
No, I don't want to wait.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.917
I just want to look
back on tonight

10:16.950 --> 10:21.421
and be like,
"aw," not "meh."

10:21.454 --> 10:24.391
Well, nobody's looking
for "meh."

10:24.424 --> 10:27.160
It's just that if the
first time isn't great,

10:27.194 --> 10:29.396
then the next time you're
worried it won't be good again,

10:29.429 --> 10:31.164
and then you're all
messed up in your head,

10:31.198 --> 10:33.333
and then the
pressure's really on.

10:33.366 --> 10:37.204
I never thought of it
that way.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.673
But I am now.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.276
You know what?
I'm being ridiculous.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.878
Of course it's gonna
be perfect,

10:44.912 --> 10:46.113
because it's you and me.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.782
Yeah.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.751
You know what?

10:50.784 --> 10:52.352
Let's do it
right here, right now.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.387
Oh.

10:54.421 --> 10:57.257
Ha. Well, you're-you're-you're
putting a lot of pressure

10:57.290 --> 10:58.959
on the next six minutes.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.895
Let's take this party
to the back.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.363
Phew.

11:07.234 --> 11:10.203
You got to be back here
for the party.

11:10.237 --> 11:13.373
Yes, I know how sex
works.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.876
Are you all right?

11:15.909 --> 11:18.445
Well, I was until you started
talking about all that stuff.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.047
How can it be perfect?

11:20.080 --> 11:21.248
I've never been perfect.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.216
I've been very good at best.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.484
It's okay, Patrick.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.953
No, it's not
okay. It's not.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.454
I-I-I can't breathe.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.456
I-I need some air.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.227
I changed my mind!

11:34.261 --> 11:36.263
I'd be perfectly happy
with "meh."

11:46.506 --> 11:48.742
How you feeling,
Patrick?

11:48.776 --> 11:52.479
Ah, pretty embarrassed, Christy.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.114
Can I come over and visit?

11:54.147 --> 11:56.950
Okay.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.529
This is my fault.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.365
I made tonight into
a way bigger deal

12:12.399 --> 12:14.234
than it needed to be.
No.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.804
I-It's not you.
It's not you.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.471
Look, I was married
for 30 years

12:18.505 --> 12:21.108
and the last five, we
didn't touch each other.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.542
And all that talk
about being perfect

12:22.575 --> 12:25.545
triggered what
WebMD diagnosed

12:25.578 --> 12:28.916
as a mild-to-moderate
panic attack.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.884
That's not sexy.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.987
I think you're very sexy.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.891
So, you're still interested

12:37.925 --> 12:40.027
in a middle-aged neurotic

12:40.060 --> 12:42.495
with only one-and-a-half
notches on his belt?

12:42.529 --> 12:45.765
Very interested.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.338
How 'bout this?

12:51.371 --> 12:53.573
We go back to your place,
go to sleep--

12:53.606 --> 12:55.542
and I mean actual sleep--

12:55.575 --> 12:57.878
and start fresh
in the morning.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.779
I love that idea.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.889
So I'm curious.

13:08.922 --> 13:12.092
What counts as half a notch?

13:15.328 --> 13:17.130
I'm holding firm on my stance.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.899
You're not supposed
to take that.

13:18.932 --> 13:21.034
They ran out of centerpieces.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.972
And I deserve a takeaway

13:25.005 --> 13:27.007
for the pain and
suffering of this dress.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.309
Pretty sure
that's hotel property.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.443
No, they expect you to take 'em.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.979
It's like robes and televisions.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.383
How amazing was that reception?

13:36.416 --> 13:37.885
What was so great about it?

13:37.918 --> 13:40.620
Did you not see
the mountain of gifts?

13:40.653 --> 13:42.355
They wiped out Pottery Barn.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.823
Now it's just a barn.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.160
You really think they need
all that junk?

13:47.194 --> 13:49.229
Of course not.
They're at the store tomorrow,

13:49.262 --> 13:51.598
returning all that stuff
for cold, hard cash.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.633
And how 'bout the dollar dance?

13:53.666 --> 13:56.169
You pin money on the bride
to dance with her?

13:56.203 --> 13:58.906
What genius
came up with that idea?

13:58.939 --> 14:01.341
Probably the first stripper
to get married.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.378
Well, I am definitely doing that
at our wedding.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.047
And I'll make more money,

14:07.080 --> 14:10.117
because I've six feet
of pinnable area.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.518
You're incredible.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.186
You know what else we could do?

14:13.220 --> 14:14.888
Corporate sponsors.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.458
"Do you, Bonnie, take Adam
to be your husband?"

14:18.491 --> 14:20.593
"I sure do, especially
after driving here

14:20.627 --> 14:23.230
on Firestone tires."

14:25.365 --> 14:29.169
Honey, our wedding
could be a real cash cow.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.471
Wow.

14:31.504 --> 14:34.441
I tell you how moved I was
by this beautiful ceremony,

14:34.474 --> 14:36.143
and you crap all over it.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.411
And then you see a pile
of toaster ovens

14:38.445 --> 14:40.547
and a woman with 20s
taped to her ass,

14:40.580 --> 14:42.282
and you can't get enough.

14:42.315 --> 14:45.052
Oh, so you're allowed
to change your mind

14:45.085 --> 14:47.087
about what kind of wedding
you want, but I'm not?

14:47.120 --> 14:48.321
No, it's bigger than
our wedding, Bonnie.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.990
It's about what we want in life.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.931
I want a fiancé who's
not a Catholic schoolgirl.

15:04.737 --> 15:08.508
Oh. Oh.

15:08.541 --> 15:09.609
Good morning.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.678
Lucy, off.

15:11.711 --> 15:14.081
Oh. No, no, no, no, no.
It's-it's okay.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.316
No, it's not okay.
She's on the boys.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.617
Lucy, off.
Come on. Come on.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.486
Attagirl.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.621
Phew. Hey.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.090
How'd you sleep?

15:23.123 --> 15:24.424
Ah.
Huh.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.293
Great. You?

15:26.326 --> 15:28.261
Excellent.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.663
I think we got this part
of the relationship down.

15:30.697 --> 15:34.334
Yes, we have
nailed sleeping.
All right.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.435
Well, you know what?

15:35.468 --> 15:36.970
That settles it then.

15:37.004 --> 15:39.139
We'll be one of those
weird couples who sleeps

15:39.172 --> 15:41.441
in the same room
and never has sex.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.675
Like Bert and Ernie.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.678
Oh, those guys are
totally doing it.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.115
Well, then,
maybe we should.

15:54.387 --> 15:59.126
Oh, boy, I'm so glad
we didn't give up on this.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.327
Me, too.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.096
I mean, the-the
long-distance thing

16:03.130 --> 16:06.299
could have been a lot
for other people, you know?

16:06.333 --> 16:10.003
I mean, we could've just
started seeing someone else.

16:10.037 --> 16:13.173
I'm really happy we didn't.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.177
We didn't, right?

16:20.180 --> 16:22.215
Well...

16:23.450 --> 16:25.618
Why on Earth would
you tell Patrick

16:25.652 --> 16:27.320
you slept with
another guy

16:27.354 --> 16:29.656
right before you were about
to sleep with Patrick?

16:29.689 --> 16:31.191
It just came up.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.460
How?
I brought it up.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.596
Cold SpaghettiOs?

16:36.629 --> 16:38.298
That says self-loathing.

16:38.331 --> 16:42.469
Yeah, and I'm using the spoon
that snags your lip.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.172
Ow.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.174
I deserve that.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.675
So why did you tell him?

16:48.708 --> 16:51.811
I didn't want to start the
relationship off with a lie.

16:51.844 --> 16:55.148
That's fine, but you got to
bang their brains out first.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.450
Then you can be honest.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.186
I do it with Adam
all the time.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.320
It's the main
reason we have sex.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.589
Oh, it is not.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.692
You and Adam are great together.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.794
I'd give anything
for what you have.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.497
Not today. We had
a huge fight.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.233
All of a sudden he wants a
traditional church wedding.

17:13.266 --> 17:16.336
Doesn't he know that if you walk
into a church wearing white,

17:16.369 --> 17:18.405
you'll burst into flames?

17:19.406 --> 17:21.308
Thank you.

17:29.516 --> 17:32.585
Mom

17:32.619 --> 17:35.488
Are you somewhere in here
having sex?

17:37.190 --> 17:38.691
Boy, I hope not.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.095
Patrick.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.798
This is for me?

17:45.832 --> 17:48.568
Well, you're not the only one

17:48.601 --> 17:51.438
who can make
a big romantic gesture.

17:52.472 --> 17:55.642
* Slow ride

17:55.675 --> 17:56.743
* Take it easy...

17:56.776 --> 17:59.512
Sorry, uh, wrong song!

17:59.546 --> 18:01.381
I-I work out to that.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.549
Okay.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.783
That's supposed to be Seal.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.286
And, uh, oh, sorry.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.887
Oh, I-I-I can't find it.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.323
Uh, look,
j-just try to imagine

18:10.357 --> 18:12.625
"Kiss From a Rose"
playing in the back...

18:18.165 --> 18:20.133
I love that you
did all this.

18:20.167 --> 18:23.403
I'm-I'm so sorry
I overreacted.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.172
You easily could have lied
and I never

18:25.205 --> 18:26.273
would have known.
I forgive you.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.340
Bedroom's this way.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.608
Uh...

18:28.641 --> 18:31.244
Oh, damn it.
What?

18:31.278 --> 18:32.545
I forgot condoms.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.347
Oh, I got
a ton of 'em.

18:34.381 --> 18:35.715
Don't think about it.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.584
Just get up here.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.200
Hey.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.567
Thanks for coming over.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.603
I don't like the way
we left things the other day.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.440
:
Wow, Bonnie.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.342
You didn't have
to do all this.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.211
Oh, no, I...

19:04.244 --> 19:06.813
Yes, yes, I did.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.516
I absolutely did.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.619
Because I love you.

19:17.457 --> 19:20.327
I love you, too. Mmm.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.495
Look, I don't want to fight
about wedding stuff.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.697
I don't either. Let's just
kick the can down the road.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.233
Or, I've been thinking,
why don't we throw out

19:26.266 --> 19:27.534
the can altogether?

19:27.567 --> 19:29.202
What does that mean?

19:29.236 --> 19:30.770
Let's just keep things
the way they are

19:30.803 --> 19:32.705
and stay engaged forever.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.807
But I want to marry you.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.513
Well, I asked you six months ago
and you won't set a date.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.583
You know, clearly, you don't
want to be the big candle.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.718
I do. I do want to
be the big candle.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.820
Let's just be happy
with what we have.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.393
No.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.228
Next year.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.364
First weekend in June. Done.
Bonnie, Bonnie.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.498
We're doing it.
I just did it.
Bonnie, we don't...

19:58.531 --> 20:00.400
Deal with it.
Order the doves.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.701
Esp...
Watch this.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.336
I'm gonna put it
in the calendar.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.374
Adam Barnabus Janikowski,

20:07.407 --> 20:08.875
did I just get played?

20:08.908 --> 20:10.877
Still not my middle name.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.612
And that depends.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.247
Should I open this card

20:14.281 --> 20:15.748
that's sitting in "my" flowers?

20:17.484 --> 20:19.852
June it is.
