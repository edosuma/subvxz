01:59.494 --> 02:02.247
Welcome to Supermax Prison.

02:02.330 --> 02:07.710
This is the only prison in the world
that can suppress any kind of superpower.

02:09.629 --> 02:11.256
As you all know,

02:11.339 --> 02:15.385
not everyone with superpowers
becomes a superhero.

02:16.010 --> 02:19.639
People who use their powers
for evil become supervillains.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.560
And this is where
those scumbag villains end up!

02:23.643 --> 02:24.477
Look around!

02:26.646 --> 02:30.900
Just because you've developed powers
doesn't mean you can do what you please.

02:30.984 --> 02:31.943
Understand?

02:35.446 --> 02:38.032
How about I shred him up
and make him chicken feed?

02:43.079 --> 02:44.372
Don't get carried away.

02:49.085 --> 02:49.919
See?

02:51.838 --> 02:54.507
Inmate number 0053839.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.593
Johnny Bolt, exit your cell.

02:57.176 --> 02:58.094
Sure thing.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.522
Johnny Boy, you breaking out?

03:09.606 --> 03:12.650
The big boss
is throwing a party today, you know?

03:13.276 --> 03:15.153
I'm getting released, not breaking out.

03:15.236 --> 03:18.865
I've got a party tonight too, dude.
With my honey.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.366
Glad to hear it.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.952
See you on the outside sometime.

03:23.036 --> 03:28.374
The fuck you goin', Bolt?
I was gonna have your ass next.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.002
Come on. How about it?

03:31.669 --> 03:33.296
Get that dirty asshole outta my face.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.756
Come on--

03:36.841 --> 03:39.218
Fuckin' scum, pissing himself like that.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.388
Come on, Johnny.
The outside's waiting for you.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.975
That's right, Eric. It's time to roll.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.238
Johnny! So today's the day.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.955
I'm sure I'll be
seeing you again soon, partner.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.625
Hate to disappoint you,
but I won't be back.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.585
This is the changing room.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.893
Restraint vest… Cover him.

04:31.062 --> 04:31.896
Release.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.529
Freedom!

04:40.196 --> 04:41.197
Here.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.033
The moment I've been waiting for.

04:46.577 --> 04:49.372
That thing's falling apart.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.082
You should really get a new one.

04:51.165 --> 04:53.084
That reeks!

04:53.167 --> 04:55.920
They're trying to cut costs, you know.

04:56.004 --> 04:59.966
They're happy just as long as
it keeps you guys from using your powers.

05:00.049 --> 05:01.968
But that's this place's selling point.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.137
Even if we got new ones,

05:04.220 --> 05:06.931
we'd have to update
the whole damn control system.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.599
That would be the perfect time

05:09.267 --> 05:10.643
to break out of this place.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.521
We've got a backup system,
so that won't happen.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.734
Inmate number 0053839.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.862
Johnny Bolt. No address. No occupation.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.615
Sentenced to eight months for
the misdemeanors of property damage

05:24.699 --> 05:27.285
caused by
a precision voltage control device

05:27.368 --> 05:31.456
and destruction of intangible data due to
widespread electromagnetic interference.

05:32.206 --> 05:34.334
Having served your time,
you're being released.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.338
What's his superpower?

05:38.421 --> 05:39.255
Warden?

05:39.839 --> 05:41.132
Let me see.

05:41.215 --> 05:44.093
He can generate and release electricity.

05:44.635 --> 05:47.013
Is he a member of the Network?

05:47.096 --> 05:49.515
No. He's got no connections.

05:50.558 --> 05:51.934
Just a punk villain?

05:52.518 --> 05:53.352
Approved.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.605
Don't come back.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.065
Sure thing!

05:57.148 --> 06:01.194
On the outside, I'll behave like
a proper citizen with superpowers.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.111
Out.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.871
What's all this about?

06:11.954 --> 06:13.956
It's that charity group.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.708
Some kind of celebration?

06:15.792 --> 06:17.543
It's a gift from Mr. Matts.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.461
Matts?

06:19.087 --> 06:22.590
I'm sure even a small-time villain
like you has heard of him.

06:23.091 --> 06:28.054
He's the world's most renowned
supervillain, Mr. Christopher Matts.

06:29.764 --> 06:33.059
Living here, you don't get
much news of the outside.

06:33.142 --> 06:36.979
Matts is also known as The Bastard.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.899
Oh, is that right? The Bastard?

06:39.982 --> 06:41.526
Don't act dumb.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.569
You caught me.

06:43.653 --> 06:47.740
Anyway, that stuff is all part
of a world way out of my reach.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.534
You're right about that.

06:51.035 --> 06:55.957
Some villains on the outside doing
charity work for villains in prison is…

06:56.916 --> 06:57.959
pretty damn fishy.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.711
What will you do when you get out?

07:00.795 --> 07:02.922
I'm not sure.

07:03.005 --> 07:05.341
I'll think about it
after having a nice fuck.

07:07.051 --> 07:09.428
You're a lucky man
to have someone waiting for you.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.517
Farewell, my friend.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.294
Johnny!

07:41.377 --> 07:43.629
What a sight for sore eyes, my sweetie.

07:52.513 --> 07:53.848
Shit. I've got a hard-on.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.600
You naughty boy.

08:05.526 --> 08:06.360
See?

08:12.116 --> 08:14.285
Being on the outside is awesome!

08:14.869 --> 08:15.912
Don't you agree, Kasey?

08:16.537 --> 08:18.498
It's time to shift gears.

08:19.957 --> 08:20.791
Holy…

08:22.001 --> 08:23.836
Damn, this is good.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.105
We're here!

09:16.597 --> 09:17.765
Johnny!

09:17.848 --> 09:18.849
Welcome back!

09:18.933 --> 09:19.767
Yeah!

09:19.850 --> 09:21.352
You guys!

09:23.062 --> 09:26.232
How the hell did you idiots get in here?

09:26.315 --> 09:29.318
Gimme a break!
We're supervillains, after all.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.278
Right?

09:30.861 --> 09:31.862
-Right!
-Right!

09:32.446 --> 09:33.322
Oh, really?

09:37.243 --> 09:38.160
Here you go!

09:38.244 --> 09:39.412
To celebrate your release.

09:39.495 --> 09:40.663
Right!

09:49.380 --> 09:51.048
Here's to

09:51.132 --> 09:52.258
Mr. Matts!

09:56.137 --> 09:58.014
Don't overdo it.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.308
Fuck off! Today, I will do as I please!

10:01.976 --> 10:04.562
Guess we owe this all
to the big boss, Matts.

10:04.645 --> 10:05.855
Say, who is that?

10:06.772 --> 10:09.191
The Bastard. He's legendary.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.194
Legendary? That's going a little far.

10:12.278 --> 10:16.198
He used to be a top villain,
but he's an old-timer now, right?

10:16.866 --> 10:17.700
Don't be stupid.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.620
The big boss is still plenty dangerous.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.414
Don't you know about Danny Dubrovny?

10:25.291 --> 10:27.168
From what I heard,

10:27.251 --> 10:29.337
Danny had gotten out
of the villain business

10:29.420 --> 10:31.881
and into some dodgy real-estate scam.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.719
After getting an investment of
five million dollars out of the big boss,

10:37.345 --> 10:39.221
he suddenly disappeared.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.223
A few years later,

10:41.307 --> 10:42.850
Danny had moved to Miami

10:42.933 --> 10:45.645
and was involved in some
Japanese business.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.814
He had a woman
and was living the good life

10:49.482 --> 10:51.901
all thanks to the money
he pinched from the big boss.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.153
Then one day,

10:55.071 --> 10:56.739
something horrible
happened to his old pal.

11:00.701 --> 11:02.995
It happened to his favorite hooker too.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.623
And to his dealer back in Baltimore.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.168
His best friend.

11:10.753 --> 11:11.796
His mother.

11:12.380 --> 11:15.299
His half-brother who lived in California.

11:16.884 --> 11:19.220
Even everyone at his accounting firm.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.389
Their heads exploded.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.808
Hold on! It was all…

11:24.392 --> 11:27.103
You see, that's how The Bastard operates.

11:27.853 --> 11:28.771
Is this about Danny?

11:29.605 --> 11:32.650
Until he and his girlfriend escaped
to the boonies,

11:32.733 --> 11:34.819
241 people had been killed.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.405
But there's no evidence of who did it.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.490
241 people?

11:40.032 --> 11:41.951
All of them were blown up remotely?

11:42.910 --> 11:44.829
Is that his power?

11:45.663 --> 11:48.332
After they'd been scared shitless,

11:48.416 --> 11:50.334
they knew how it would end for them.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.587
Danny… It hurts!

11:54.088 --> 11:55.965
-It hurts!
-What's wrong?

11:56.048 --> 11:57.341
My head!

11:57.425 --> 12:00.177
It's like someone is pumping air into it!

12:00.261 --> 12:01.345
It hurts!

12:01.971 --> 12:04.557
No! Stop!

12:07.268 --> 12:08.561
God damn it!

12:08.644 --> 12:11.689
Matts! Kill me!

12:11.772 --> 12:13.023
I know you're after me!

12:13.107 --> 12:15.401
Kill me!

12:15.484 --> 12:16.861
Just kill me now!

12:26.620 --> 12:30.249
Why the fuck would I grant you your wish?

12:35.254 --> 12:37.339
That's The Bastard for you.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.429
To Mr. Matts.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.557
Here's to the big boss's Network.

12:47.099 --> 12:51.729
I thought that
the villains Network was an urban legend.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.898
That's right.

12:53.981 --> 12:57.860
The legend is a secret system
that exists outside the real world.

12:58.527 --> 13:02.198
It's a shadow world that
second-rate lowlifes like you can't see.

13:02.281 --> 13:05.284
Everyone that's a part of it
gets locked up here.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.453
He's the big boss of

13:07.536 --> 13:12.291
the supervillain Network that stretches
from the West Coast to the East Coast.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.669
Here's to Mr. Matts.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.883
You seem to be having fun, Warden.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.136
That's right. Thank you.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.305
Even the unruly scumbags

13:26.388 --> 13:28.891
are patiently waiting
until their sentences are over.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.476
I'm glad to hear it.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.269
Most important for us is

13:32.353 --> 13:35.231
to value our connections
with our comrades.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.527
Well, well…

13:40.027 --> 13:42.196
Tell the big boss thanks from me.

13:42.279 --> 13:43.364
Certainly.

13:44.615 --> 13:45.491
By the way…

13:45.991 --> 13:50.120
I heard a rumor that the big boss
was taking all the loot he's gained

13:50.204 --> 13:52.540
and going abroad with it.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.335
Nothing more than a rumor.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.673
Bring some salsa!

14:00.756 --> 14:02.299
You guys are drunk!

14:05.261 --> 14:07.304
What's that? I like your taste.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.640
I figured you would.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.518
I told you, Kismet.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.520
Johnny knows what good taste is.

14:14.603 --> 14:18.816
Whenever I wear gold and shit like that,

14:19.441 --> 14:22.361
I always think
it will get snatched off me.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.322
That's 'cause you spread bad luck, dude.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.409
I can't help it. That's my power.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.536
I don't spread bad luck 'cause I want to.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.204
Yeah, right.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.789
Shut up, bad luck.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.084
Lately, we've had good luck.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.253
Really? What's up?

14:40.963 --> 14:44.842
We learned what it takes
to survive in this tech-driven society.

14:45.467 --> 14:49.513
It's more like we're slaves to tech
than people who learned how to use it.

14:50.055 --> 14:54.476
What? With our string of successes,
we've been lucky boys lately!

14:54.560 --> 14:55.811
Yeah, maybe so, but…

14:56.478 --> 15:00.190
To celebrate your return, Johnny,

15:00.274 --> 15:03.986
we've come up with a plan for a huge job.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.321
Right!

15:06.488 --> 15:07.489
What kind of job?

15:10.618 --> 15:11.577
Let me show you.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.579
Hold on.

15:14.121 --> 15:17.499
If you-know-who hears this,
it'll cause us trouble.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.251
It's okay. Tell me about it.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.962
This place could be bugged too.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.384
Okay. This will knock your socks off.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.554
Are you planning a bank heist?

15:31.263 --> 15:34.016
Cash is nothing but numbers.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.102
What's more, its value changes every day.

15:37.186 --> 15:40.272
This is something
that doesn't change. Gemstones.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.900
Which store are we going after?

15:42.983 --> 15:46.195
Which store? That's a joke!
We're going after ten places

15:46.278 --> 15:47.821
in under ten minutes.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.531
Ten places in ten minutes?

15:49.615 --> 15:51.533
They're all close to one another.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.036
It's possible if we go by motorcycle.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.287
Right!

15:55.371 --> 15:58.248
The key is the number
of places and the time.

15:58.332 --> 16:01.794
We don't care
if we don't get much from each place.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.128
If we want to be greedy,

16:03.212 --> 16:06.298
we just increase
the number of places we hit.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.595
Now I get it.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.430
If we hit that many all at once…

16:13.931 --> 16:16.976
It'll throw cops
and security companies into a panic.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.177
What's more, I think you know
that downtown San Francisco

16:52.261 --> 16:54.346
is one of the places in the US

16:54.430 --> 16:57.558
with the lowest frequency of events
caused by superpowers.

16:57.641 --> 16:58.475
Which means…

16:59.351 --> 17:00.769
No heroes will interfere.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.858
Each place in under a minute.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.280
That's seriously awesome!

17:11.363 --> 17:12.448
Told ya!

17:12.531 --> 17:13.866
Whose plan is this?

17:13.949 --> 17:15.034
It was the Net--

17:15.117 --> 17:17.536
It was ours, obviously! Right?

17:17.619 --> 17:18.495
Right!

17:18.579 --> 17:20.622
You guys are geniuses!

17:20.706 --> 17:21.999
I've had it with this!

17:22.916 --> 17:24.209
Kasey…

17:25.002 --> 17:29.423
If you hold tight
for a while and get a normal job,

17:29.506 --> 17:31.050
then a good job will come along.

17:31.633 --> 17:32.926
What kind of job would that be?

17:33.677 --> 17:35.637
Helping those veggie freaks?

17:35.721 --> 17:37.806
They're the decadent 1%.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.100
That's the jealousy of the 99%.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.269
Hello.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.856
Welcome to an organic café
where you can enjoy

17:45.939 --> 17:47.649
the true flavor of vegetables,

17:48.317 --> 17:50.110
Green Green.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.821
Nearly all the food we get from

17:52.905 --> 17:55.115
local small farms
and the farmer's market is

17:55.699 --> 17:57.493
100% organic.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.456
We make the most of the ingredients,

18:02.539 --> 18:07.169
so you won't believe that
you're actually only eating vegetables.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.718
You wanna work with those dilettantes too?

18:14.802 --> 18:15.636
Nah.

18:15.719 --> 18:19.139
See? And with you around,
this'll be a breeze.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.600
Yeah, I guess you're right.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.477
Here's to Johnny the Bolt!

18:23.560 --> 18:24.978
It'll be a breeze!

18:25.062 --> 18:25.896
Johnny!

18:28.982 --> 18:32.152
Say, you guys shouldn't get so drunk.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.321
What? What are you talking about?

18:34.822 --> 18:37.199
We're not done drinking yet.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.158
Right!

18:38.742 --> 18:40.077
But you know…

18:41.036 --> 18:43.831
See how hammered you are?

18:45.207 --> 18:46.416
Right.

19:01.348 --> 19:02.850
Now, come on, Johnny.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.269
Did you use your power?

19:07.479 --> 19:09.523
At last, we're alone.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.776
Such a naughty girl.

19:20.742 --> 19:21.660
I'm back.

19:22.744 --> 19:26.999
Everyone at Supermax Prison,
including the warden, Frank,

19:27.082 --> 19:28.876
sends their thanks.

19:30.085 --> 19:34.464
They say their ties with our Network
are heartfelt and sturdy.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.551
Mr. Matts?

19:39.178 --> 19:40.554
Can you understand it?

19:42.389 --> 19:44.057
Piet Mondrian, you mean?

19:44.975 --> 19:47.394
He says, "To live shrewdly in this world,

19:47.477 --> 19:51.690
one must always look
at the big picture and be objective."

19:52.482 --> 19:57.154
Mondrian's works
are known as abstract art.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.616
They're geometric, beautifully designed,

20:00.699 --> 20:05.245
and even now, 100 years later,
they're universally recognized.

20:06.038 --> 20:10.250
However, even with works
that look so abstract,

20:10.334 --> 20:15.172
some were influenced by
the objective real world.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.966
Broadway Boogie Woogie.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.427
It's a bird's-eye view of Manhattan,

20:20.510 --> 20:23.680
a diagram of the gridwork
that divides up the city.

20:24.264 --> 20:25.307
In this diagram,

20:25.807 --> 20:29.937
you can feel the American music
the Dutch expatriate loved.

20:30.020 --> 20:34.691
Its beat and rhythm throb
through the city like nerve pulses.

20:34.775 --> 20:35.776
I see.

20:36.777 --> 20:41.031
In this world,
one needs a balanced rhythm.

20:41.114 --> 20:41.949
The Salamander.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.576
Yes, Mr. Matts?

20:45.535 --> 20:49.581
Everything is a matter
of cause and effect.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.793
That's how the Network functions.

21:06.723 --> 21:09.685
Well, I'll be pretty busy tomorrow.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.853
Hold on. You can't be serious.

21:11.937 --> 21:12.980
You bet I am.

21:13.063 --> 21:16.316
You'll join those idiots
in that plan they told you about?

21:16.984 --> 21:18.402
It's a good deal.

21:18.485 --> 21:22.030
I haven't worked in over six months,
so my wallet's pretty bare.

21:22.739 --> 21:25.158
So why don't you join us, Kasey?

21:25.242 --> 21:26.368
What?

21:26.451 --> 21:31.373
I mean, come on,
that power of yours is freaking awesome.

21:31.456 --> 21:32.666
No way.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.001
Aw, come on.

21:34.084 --> 21:36.128
I know full well you're a supervillain

21:36.211 --> 21:40.799
who's only interested in big games,
but do it to celebrate my release.

21:40.882 --> 21:41.800
Not a chance.

21:41.883 --> 21:45.512
Besides, do you know
who came up with that plan?

21:45.595 --> 21:46.596
Who?

21:47.180 --> 21:48.307
The Network.

21:49.933 --> 21:53.061
It's a secret organization
of supervillains.

21:53.562 --> 21:54.688
Don't you know it?

21:54.771 --> 21:56.523
Oh… Well…

21:57.274 --> 21:58.900
Of course, I know it!

21:58.984 --> 22:03.280
For providing the plans,
they take a cut of the money.

22:03.864 --> 22:04.990
They always get their money.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.287
They're a criminal elite

22:10.370 --> 22:14.291
who make others do the dirty work
while building supervillain solidarity.

22:14.374 --> 22:16.001
This sounds fishy.

22:16.626 --> 22:19.796
Even if the jobs go perfectly,
they get a percentage of the take.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.423
Is that what you want?

22:22.132 --> 22:27.346
I'm not hiding by working with
those dilettantes because I want to.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.555
You know that.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.266
But we need excitement too, right?

22:31.349 --> 22:32.559
Yes, of course.

22:33.060 --> 22:35.562
But idiotic excitement is costly.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.606
I want a life that's more stable.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.067
Any work I do with supervillains

22:40.150 --> 22:43.737
has to have a good balance
between the risks and the rewards.

22:45.238 --> 22:46.615
Balance?

22:46.698 --> 22:48.200
It's all about balance.

22:48.742 --> 22:52.621
To live smart, you've got to see
the whole picture and be more objective.

22:53.580 --> 22:54.706
Live smart, huh?

22:55.207 --> 22:59.711
Doing jewel heists with morons is not
what you do the day after your release.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.965
But we're supervillains, after all.

23:04.591 --> 23:07.761
If we had your power to deceive people,

23:08.345 --> 23:13.391
it would work better and be more reliable
than Kismet spreading bad luck.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.312
Listen to me, Johnny.

23:18.855 --> 23:23.151
With your power,
you can do so many more wonderful things.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.361
Maybe so.

23:24.444 --> 23:25.737
I can tell.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.615
You and I should hide who we are

23:28.698 --> 23:31.910
until a far, far better chance
comes along.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.037
You see, you and I…

23:34.746 --> 23:35.580
Me and you…

23:36.164 --> 23:38.083
This isn't where our story should end.

23:38.875 --> 23:39.918
You're right.

23:40.001 --> 23:40.877
Understand?

23:43.839 --> 23:45.799
Yeah. I'll turn them down.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.556
Shop number ten!

23:53.515 --> 23:54.474
The last place.

23:54.558 --> 23:57.144
Time to throw my bad-luck kiss.

23:57.227 --> 23:58.395
This is the icing on the cake.

23:58.478 --> 23:59.312
Right!

24:00.188 --> 24:01.481
Welcome.

24:07.445 --> 24:08.655
That's what I like.

24:09.906 --> 24:11.283
Right!

24:13.702 --> 24:15.996
Damn. Talk about sparkly.

24:16.079 --> 24:18.623
Awesome. Take that too.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.625
This is the last place, so may as well.

24:21.251 --> 24:23.170
Hey! We're outta time!

24:25.881 --> 24:27.966
Crap! We gotta split!

26:12.487 --> 26:17.492
