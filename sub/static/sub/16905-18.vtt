- what?
- My kindergarten teacher

00:07.671 --> 00:08.883
was a former black panther.

00:08.901 --> 00:09.761
Oh.

00:10.296 --> 00:12.363
Hey, I'm gonna fix that
loose baseboard upstairs.

00:12.431 --> 00:13.398
Wow, look at you,

00:13.465 --> 00:14.933
all sweaty with your tool belt

00:15.001 --> 00:16.334
and your '90s haircut.

00:16.402 --> 00:17.803
You look like
you're in a gay porno.

00:17.870 --> 00:19.938
Oh, yeah?
You're one to talk, buddy.

00:20.006 --> 00:21.005
I'm Brent.

00:21.073 --> 00:22.439
I'm the new guy on the crew.

00:22.507 --> 00:24.575
I'm Rod.
I'm the boss.

00:24.642 --> 00:28.045
And what I say goes.

00:28.113 --> 00:30.414
I've never been
with a man before.

00:30.481 --> 00:33.617
Looks like
I'm the boss now... Rod.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.352
- Oh! What are we doing?
- I don't know.

00:35.420 --> 00:38.254
Whatever! Let's wrestle!
It doesn't matter.

00:39.790 --> 00:42.125
Liz, what is "adoption stuff"?

00:43.493 --> 00:44.894
- Are you adopting a kid?
- No. Don't worry.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.963
That's from a long time ago.
It's not happening.

00:47.031 --> 00:50.700
You have a baby name book,
and you circled Adolf?

00:50.768 --> 00:52.068
Actually, I borrowed that book
from my mother,

00:52.136 --> 00:53.535
so be glad I'm not a boy.

00:53.603 --> 00:56.739
Okay, well,
why'd you give up on it?

00:56.806 --> 00:58.440
I have to work late tonight.

00:58.507 --> 01:00.408
What am I gonna do with Joshua?

01:00.476 --> 01:02.410
I thought I could do this
by myself.

01:02.478 --> 01:03.411
You know what?

01:03.479 --> 01:05.313
Murphy brown lied to us.

01:05.381 --> 01:06.381
She had Eldin.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.751
Can you hold that, please?

01:09.818 --> 01:10.752
You closed the door on her?

01:10.819 --> 01:12.053
The point, Criss,

01:12.121 --> 01:13.287
is I didn't want
to be that woman.

01:13.355 --> 01:14.655
I didn't want to do it alone.

01:14.723 --> 01:15.957
But let's face it.

01:16.024 --> 01:17.358
Murphy Brown had
the whole <i>fyi</i> gang

01:17.425 --> 01:18.492
in her corner...

01:18.560 --> 01:20.394
Jim Dial, Frank Fontana, Corky,

01:20.462 --> 01:21.929
even Miles, in his own way.

01:21.997 --> 01:23.231
Yeah, but you're not alone now,

01:23.298 --> 01:26.900
and if a kid is something
that you still want,

01:26.968 --> 01:27.968
and you're in your 40s,

01:28.035 --> 01:30.436
then...
We should...

01:30.504 --> 01:31.638
we should have a...
we should have

01:31.705 --> 01:33.273
a serious conversation
right now.

01:33.340 --> 01:35.341
Oh, my God, relax.

01:35.409 --> 01:37.110
This is my life, and I love it.

01:37.178 --> 01:38.812
I've got my job,
and I've got you,

01:38.880 --> 01:41.180
and I keep getting
my neighbor <i>allure</i> magazine.

01:41.248 --> 01:43.783
If there's anything that needs
fixing in my life,

01:43.850 --> 01:45.417
it's a certain loose baseboard.

01:45.485 --> 01:49.421
Okay, well, I'm gonna fix it.

01:49.489 --> 01:50.956
And do not send Brent up there.

01:51.024 --> 01:52.175
I won't.

01:55.495 --> 01:56.232
Dude, I'm back

01:56.241 --> 01:58.163

this country's taken
some hits lately.

02:20.785 --> 02:22.953
But when we get hit
and are down,

02:23.021 --> 02:24.822
we don't stay down.

02:24.889 --> 02:26.857
We get up, and we hit back

02:26.925 --> 02:29.692
with our fists
or our nunchakus.

02:29.759 --> 02:32.962
And then, when we're done
hitting and we're tired,

02:33.030 --> 02:35.364
'cause nunchaku-ing
can wear a guy out,

02:35.432 --> 02:38.000
we sit down on a couch,

02:38.068 --> 02:40.002
an American couch...

02:40.070 --> 02:42.038
A Kouchtown couch.

02:44.174 --> 02:45.874
Damn.

02:45.942 --> 02:48.643
Lemon, do you know
you are sitting

02:48.711 --> 02:50.378
on 5,000 new jobs?

02:50.446 --> 02:53.348
And not jobs that came
from some government bailout.

02:53.415 --> 02:55.984
They came
from a rich white guy.

02:56.052 --> 02:58.453
We have been creating and
solving this country's pRoblems

02:58.520 --> 03:00.421
for 200 years.

03:00.489 --> 03:02.022
Where's our history month?

03:02.090 --> 03:03.023
It is a nice couch.

03:03.091 --> 03:04.925
Good lumbar support.

03:04.993 --> 03:06.861
Absorbent fabric for nap drool.

03:06.928 --> 03:07.895
That's just the prototype.

03:07.963 --> 03:09.463
As we speak,
our fellow countrymen

03:09.530 --> 03:11.031
are rolling the new
Kabletown couches

03:11.099 --> 03:12.333
off the assembly line,

03:12.400 --> 03:14.301
earning an honest day's pay

03:14.369 --> 03:16.870
so they can go to the store
and buy milk for their families,

03:16.937 --> 03:18.738
which costs...

03:18.805 --> 03:21.941
I don't know, $90 a gallon?

03:22.009 --> 03:24.443
I'm meeting
with the vendors tomorrow,

03:24.511 --> 03:26.712
Raymour and his
conjoined twin, Flanigan.

03:26.780 --> 03:29.115
Ashley of Ashley furniture
will be there,

03:29.183 --> 03:32.585
and he is a genitally
androgynous pinhead.

03:32.652 --> 03:33.752
Hmm.

03:33.819 --> 03:34.887
It's a colorful industry

03:34.954 --> 03:37.192
with a lot of fun characters.

03:37.312 --> 03:39.724
Well, good luck fixing America.

03:39.792 --> 03:43.579
I hope success
isn't far, far away.

03:43.699 --> 03:45.230
What about <i>star wars</i>
<i>do you want to say, lemon?</i>

03:45.298 --> 03:46.431
Let's just get to it.

03:46.499 --> 03:47.799
I did some spring cleaning
this morning,

03:47.867 --> 03:51.135
and I found this
baby princess Leia costume

03:51.203 --> 03:52.803
that I bought years ago,

03:52.871 --> 03:53.825
and I thought
it might fit Liddy.

03:54.079 --> 03:55.806
Oh, thank you, lemon.

03:55.874 --> 03:58.042
It might be a bit small
by Halloween.

03:58.110 --> 03:59.510
Halloween?
A girl can wear this anywhere.

03:59.577 --> 04:02.246
School, church,
alone on the playground,

04:02.314 --> 04:03.647
a child therapist's office.

04:03.715 --> 04:05.882
Also, I thought you might want

04:05.950 --> 04:09.052
this Nixon biography that my dad
gave me for my birthday.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.486
It had just come out,

04:10.554 --> 04:12.847
so as a joke,
my dad signed it as Nixon.

04:12.876 --> 04:14.657
Yes, a joke.

04:14.725 --> 04:16.659
Nixon's been dead
almost 20 years,

04:16.726 --> 04:19.329
not in cryogenic hibernation,

04:19.397 --> 04:22.164
resting up for 2016.

04:22.232 --> 04:23.432
I'm getting rid of all my junk

04:23.499 --> 04:25.267
so Criss can redo the upstairs.

04:25.335 --> 04:26.936
Wow, you two
are really nesting.

04:27.003 --> 04:28.270
Yeah, all that's missing

04:28.338 --> 04:30.739
is the joint
answering machine message.

04:30.807 --> 04:31.773
I'm thinking Sonny and...

04:31.841 --> 04:33.575
Cher.

04:33.643 --> 04:35.477
Lemon, I know
how this will be received,

04:35.545 --> 04:37.178
but before it's too late,

04:37.246 --> 04:38.779
let me set you up with someone.

04:38.847 --> 04:40.315
Oh, my God.
Come on, Jack.

04:40.382 --> 04:42.350
My colleague is newly single.
His name is Kevin.

04:42.418 --> 04:43.651
I'm gonna stop you at Kevin.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.987
Has anyone ever known
a good person named Kevin?

04:46.055 --> 04:48.089
Kevin garnett
helped me move once.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.154
I'm good, thanks.

04:49.182 --> 04:51.792
Kevin costner cooked me dinner
after a bad breakup.

04:52.130 --> 04:54.794
Kevin Sorbo intRoduced me
to his podiatrist.

04:57.198 --> 04:58.531
This is an outrage.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.367
I didn't get to work
an hour late

05:00.435 --> 05:01.868
just to be the first one here.

05:01.936 --> 05:04.004
I'm sorry, tray.
I don't know where Jenna is.

05:04.072 --> 05:05.205
I'm sorry I'm late.

05:05.273 --> 05:07.640
I was busy burning down
the panda express

05:07.708 --> 05:09.041
that I had fallen in love with.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.777
Oh, my God, Jenna.
Are you okay?

05:11.845 --> 05:13.045
I'm fine, Liz.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.147
I'm just having
a celebrity breakdown.

05:15.215 --> 05:16.715
It's the new sex tape.

05:16.783 --> 05:19.285
Something I wish I'd known
before I released my sex tape

05:19.353 --> 05:20.486
with the six flags guy.

05:20.553 --> 05:22.355
- So this is just for attention?
- Exactly.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.056
Anyone who's anyone
has had a breakdown.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.824
"Da-mi", "de-mi",
Heather, Lindsay,

05:26.892 --> 05:28.360
Britney, Muammar...

05:28.427 --> 05:30.528
so sad.
A life cut short.

05:30.596 --> 05:33.064
He gave the best diamonds.
Okay, good.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.466
I thought maybe you were
really losing it,

05:34.533 --> 05:36.334
because, you know,
Paul's with someone else and...

05:36.402 --> 05:38.870
oh, no.
This is for Paul.

05:38.937 --> 05:40.205
You see,
when you have a breakdown,

05:40.272 --> 05:42.006
all your old lovers
come out of the woodwork.

05:42.073 --> 05:44.575
Justin and K-fed,
Bruce and Ashton,

05:44.643 --> 05:47.244
Samantha Ronson
and Herbie the Lovebug.

05:47.312 --> 05:49.013
This is how I get Paul back.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.848
Wow, that is idiotic.

05:50.916 --> 05:53.183
But as long as it
doesn't affect work...

05:53.251 --> 05:55.786
what's that, celestia?
All right.

05:55.854 --> 05:57.093
I'll do it.

06:06.330 --> 06:07.731
Mr. Donaghy, hi.

06:07.798 --> 06:09.032
I'm Stewart der.

06:09.099 --> 06:10.767
I'm the chief engineer
here at Kouchtown.

06:10.835 --> 06:12.468
Do you know the history
of this building, Stewart?

06:12.537 --> 06:15.604
During world war ii,
the Bazooka Joe corporation

06:15.672 --> 06:17.773
used a softer version
of their gum

06:17.841 --> 06:20.475
to make armor-piercing
bullets... Here.

06:20.544 --> 06:23.278
Years later,
the government took it over.

06:23.346 --> 06:24.947
They turned it
into a training facility

06:25.015 --> 06:27.449
for single mothers
to teach illegal immigrants

06:27.517 --> 06:29.384
how to fill out
unemployment forms.

06:29.452 --> 06:31.252
But then we took it back.

06:31.319 --> 06:34.155
Ah, good morning,
fellow patriots.

06:34.222 --> 06:35.289
Keep voting republican.

06:35.357 --> 06:37.324
We've got your back.

06:37.392 --> 06:38.927
Now let me have a look

06:38.994 --> 06:41.395
at this marvel
of American industry.

06:43.032 --> 06:45.066
Good God!

06:45.133 --> 06:46.600
This doesn't look
like the prototype.

06:46.668 --> 06:47.668
Looks more like the prototype

06:47.735 --> 06:49.536
than most things in this world.

06:49.604 --> 06:50.604
How could this happen?

06:50.672 --> 06:52.405
The one in my office
was perfect.

06:52.473 --> 06:54.274
Oh, we didn't make
the prototype.

06:54.341 --> 06:56.009
We bought it at west elm.

06:56.077 --> 06:58.439
Besides you,
whom do I fire for this?

06:58.477 --> 07:00.080
I don't know. You?

07:00.147 --> 07:01.647
I mean, you're the one
who insisted on hiring

07:01.715 --> 07:03.148
American engineers.

07:03.216 --> 07:05.417
All they teach us now is
how to build rollercoasters

07:05.485 --> 07:06.852
and <i>survivor</i> challenges.

07:06.920 --> 07:10.089
This is what we've been
making for the past month?

07:10.156 --> 07:11.791
We have 10,000 of these?

07:11.858 --> 07:14.159
I wouldn't know.
I'm not a math guy, really.

07:14.227 --> 07:16.361
This is only a setback.

07:16.429 --> 07:18.663
I just have to create a market
for terrible couches.

07:18.731 --> 07:22.067
Besides, what did
Theodore "Bazooka" Joe do

07:22.134 --> 07:23.668
when his eccentric
millionaire father

07:23.736 --> 07:26.237
left him nothing
but a tiny pink rock quarry?

07:26.305 --> 07:30.308
He baked those rocks
and sold them to children.

07:30.375 --> 07:32.644
As gum.

07:36.214 --> 07:37.715
Tracy, I need your input.

07:37.782 --> 07:40.050
I cannot give it to you.
I'm a married man.

07:40.118 --> 07:41.283
But more importantly,

07:41.351 --> 07:42.952
I find you very unattractive.

07:43.020 --> 07:44.954
No, I need your advice.

07:45.022 --> 07:46.489
I'm having
a celebrity breakdown.

07:46.556 --> 07:48.124
I've been there, j-mo.

07:48.191 --> 07:49.325
What's the matter?

07:49.392 --> 07:51.094
Partying too hard
with Christian slater?

07:51.161 --> 07:53.529
Furious about Nafta?
Y2k panic?

07:53.597 --> 07:55.231
My heyday was the '90s.

07:55.298 --> 07:57.232
No, Tracy, I'm faking it

07:57.299 --> 07:59.234
to get Paul to come back
and take care of me.

07:59.301 --> 08:01.103
Fake breakdown.

08:01.170 --> 08:02.085
Interesting.

08:02.104 --> 08:04.172
I thought next I'd go nuts
on the <i>today</i> show,

08:04.240 --> 08:06.174
really blow it out.
Jenna!

08:06.242 --> 08:09.048
Did Hamlet start the play
by stabbing people?

08:09.168 --> 08:09.978
No.

08:10.046 --> 08:12.980
He started by being boring
and ruining my anniversary,

08:13.048 --> 08:14.849
'cause Angie wanted
to take advantage

08:14.916 --> 08:16.784
of "all the great theatre
in New York".

08:16.852 --> 08:18.185
Okay, I get it.

08:18.253 --> 08:20.121
You have to build
to the big breakdown,

08:20.188 --> 08:22.456
like in
a c+c music factory song.

08:22.524 --> 08:24.224
My heyday was also the '90s.

08:24.292 --> 08:25.993
So what have you done so far?

08:26.061 --> 08:27.494
Well, I've acted crazy at work.

08:27.562 --> 08:29.529
And I think this blind item
in the <i>post</i>

08:29.596 --> 08:30.997
is about me.

08:31.065 --> 08:32.832
"What teenage a-lister..."

08:32.900 --> 08:34.900
get serious!

08:34.969 --> 08:36.535
We have work to do.

08:36.602 --> 08:39.337
Hey, want to watch <i>Mythbusters?</i>

08:39.405 --> 08:40.774
Mm. Can we have sex after?

08:40.841 --> 08:42.475
'Cause those guys always put
fuel in my tank.

08:44.844 --> 08:48.480
Who is
cigarfan@nbcuni.Com?

08:48.548 --> 08:51.616
"Avail 4 java <i>manana per Jack.</i>

08:51.685 --> 08:53.504
Deets 2 follow. Kev"

08:53.624 --> 08:54.753
who is kev?

08:54.821 --> 08:58.037
Oh, my God.
He gave him my email?

08:58.056 --> 08:58.657
Who gave who your email?

08:58.725 --> 08:59.892
Okay, I know you're not
gonna be threatened

08:59.959 --> 09:01.092
or jealous about this.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.727
'Cause I got it going on?

09:02.795 --> 09:03.728
Jack is trying to set me up

09:03.796 --> 09:05.029
with some d-bag
he works with.

09:05.097 --> 09:07.298
"Sent from one of
my four iPads"?

09:07.365 --> 09:08.833
This guy sounds amazing.

09:08.901 --> 09:10.267
Obviously, I'm not going.

09:10.335 --> 09:12.970
Let me just write him back
in his language.

09:13.038 --> 09:15.684
"Broseph.
Sor-sor on the haps..."

09:15.804 --> 09:17.540
no, you know what?
You should go.

09:17.608 --> 09:18.902
What, are you kidding?

09:18.921 --> 09:19.609
No, if you don't go,

09:19.677 --> 09:20.744
you're not gonna be able
to tell Jack

09:20.812 --> 09:21.945
how wrong he is.

09:22.013 --> 09:23.814
If you do go just have coffee
with this guy,

09:23.881 --> 09:25.481
maybe Jack will shut up,

09:25.549 --> 09:27.084
and I'll finally get
the acceptance

09:27.151 --> 09:29.285
that, you know,
every 39-year-old man craves

09:29.353 --> 09:30.620
from his girlfriend's boss.

09:30.688 --> 09:32.155
I do like telling Jack
when he's wrong.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.523
And maybe Kevin
will insist on paying,

09:34.591 --> 09:37.459
and I can get a jazz cd
and a ham sandwich.

09:37.527 --> 09:40.863
"Dudely, let's make coffee
our bitch."

09:46.227 --> 09:48.763
When did we get so soft?

09:49.036 --> 09:51.070
You know what this country
used to sit on?

09:51.138 --> 09:52.338
Logs.

09:52.405 --> 09:53.606
Girders.

09:53.673 --> 09:54.607
Poles.

09:54.674 --> 09:56.242
Being comfortable?

09:56.309 --> 10:00.212
That's not what America's
all about.

10:00.279 --> 10:04.149
Kouchtown.
Sit down or get out of the way.

10:04.217 --> 10:05.751
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

10:05.818 --> 10:07.152
Help, I can't move.

10:07.220 --> 10:10.722
Tell me, can you even look
at the television?

10:10.790 --> 10:12.257
I can see the floor.

10:12.324 --> 10:14.258
I can see the veins
behind my eyes.

10:14.325 --> 10:16.193
Oh! I can see pain!

10:16.261 --> 10:17.361
Come.

10:17.428 --> 10:19.396
My whole body is asleep.
Oh!

10:19.464 --> 10:21.298
That's a bad couch, Jack.

10:21.366 --> 10:22.299
It is unfortunate.

10:22.367 --> 10:24.235
The design forces the sitter

10:24.302 --> 10:26.303
into what Israeli
military interrogators call

10:26.371 --> 10:28.839
a stress position.

10:28.907 --> 10:29.839
Oh.

10:29.907 --> 10:31.440
It cuts off circulation
to the legs

10:31.508 --> 10:33.843
while simultaneously
spreading out the ribcage,

10:33.911 --> 10:35.522
making it difficult to breathe

10:35.523 --> 10:38.114
while the body begs
for oxygenated blood.

10:38.182 --> 10:40.049
It comes in espresso,
dandelion,

10:40.117 --> 10:42.451
putty, and,
as you see here, lagoon.

10:42.519 --> 10:44.888
So you're gonna just try
to sell discomfort?

10:44.955 --> 10:46.155
I don't have a choice.

10:46.222 --> 10:47.355
If I blow this,

10:47.423 --> 10:48.891
Hank hooper will never give me
another shot.

10:48.958 --> 10:51.059
I'll spend the rest of my career
behind this desk

10:51.127 --> 10:52.828
trying to lure alf
back to television.

10:52.896 --> 10:54.129
Okay, Jack.

10:54.197 --> 10:56.731
Well, I'm gonna go meet
your buddy Kevin now.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.667
Yes, he mentioned
you were getting together.

10:58.734 --> 11:00.402
And you certainly are
dressed to impress.

11:00.469 --> 11:01.770
You look like
a substitute teacher

11:01.837 --> 11:03.370
who just got
her one-year a.A. Chip.

11:03.438 --> 11:05.639
Well, I'm just doing this
as a formality, Jack.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.648
Lemon, I know
you don't trust me,

11:07.667 --> 11:08.676
but keep an open mind.

11:08.743 --> 11:10.278
I'll do my best,
but I watched, like,

11:10.345 --> 11:11.846
thr <i>Mythbusters</i> last night,

11:11.914 --> 11:14.849
so I'm pretty exhausted,
if you know what I mean.

11:17.286 --> 11:19.853
Our next guest has had
a troubling 24 hours

11:19.921 --> 11:21.321
that has the tabloids talking

11:21.388 --> 11:25.258
and her friends... Concerned.

11:25.326 --> 11:26.392
Let's take a look.

11:26.460 --> 11:27.460
Thank you.

11:27.528 --> 11:28.895
Dhanalakshmi,
I'm happy for you,

11:28.963 --> 11:30.663
and I'm gonna let you finish,
but I just gotta say,

11:30.731 --> 11:32.465
Gurubarath Kurrupuswami spelled

11:32.533 --> 11:35.000
one of the toughest words
of all time!

11:35.068 --> 11:36.668
That's yesterday afternoon.

11:36.736 --> 11:38.237
Here you are
earlier this morning

11:38.305 --> 11:42.774
being asked to leave
dick Cavett's birthday party.

11:42.843 --> 11:44.710
That's unfortunate.

11:44.777 --> 11:48.881
Then a kleptomania relapse
ending in orgasm and arrest.

11:48.949 --> 11:51.316
Wow, Jenna Maroney
has gone crazy.

11:51.383 --> 11:53.751
She sure has,
said the second guy.

11:53.819 --> 11:55.753
Jenna, I know a lot of people
are asking,

11:55.821 --> 11:57.288
are you okay?

11:57.356 --> 11:59.357
Matthew, I'd really prefer
to just talk

11:59.424 --> 12:01.125
about my upcoming project.

12:01.193 --> 12:04.729
Me running through that window.

12:04.796 --> 12:06.597
Aah!

12:08.032 --> 12:09.667
Right this way, folks.

12:09.735 --> 12:12.135
Mr. Donaghy will be with you
in just a moment.

12:12.203 --> 12:13.471
I'm so sorry.

12:13.538 --> 12:15.272
Where I'm from,
Uncle Sam's mouth is sewn up,

12:15.340 --> 12:18.576
and then he's set on fire,
so I don't know how he talks.

12:23.681 --> 12:25.983
Greetings, gentlemen

12:26.050 --> 12:28.718
and female eunuchs
of the furniture industry.

12:28.786 --> 12:32.622
I give you a new couch
for a new era,

12:32.690 --> 12:35.259
designed and manufactured in...

12:35.326 --> 12:36.860
America.

12:36.928 --> 12:38.450
It's a simple couch.

12:38.570 --> 12:39.695
Oh, good God, my leg!

12:39.763 --> 12:41.163
I can hack it.

12:41.231 --> 12:42.398
Pain is in the mind.

12:42.465 --> 12:43.599
Oh, sweet heaven.

12:43.666 --> 12:45.451
It's like I'm full
of lightning.

12:45.488 --> 12:46.765
Jack, it's Ethan Allen.

12:46.784 --> 12:47.536
Are you all right?

12:47.604 --> 12:48.670
What do you want to know?

12:48.738 --> 12:49.872
I'll tell you anything
to make it stop.

12:49.940 --> 12:52.241
You want secrets?
I'll give you secrets.

12:52.309 --> 12:54.543
This couch...
Is a failure.

12:54.611 --> 12:55.877
I hate golf.

12:55.945 --> 12:57.812
One time in college,
I smoked a clove cigarette.

12:57.880 --> 13:00.681
I keep buying candles as gifts
and keeping them for myself.

13:00.749 --> 13:03.218
My natural hair color
is bright red.

13:03.286 --> 13:04.386
Agh!

13:04.453 --> 13:05.520
Amateur hour.

13:05.587 --> 13:07.088
Ugh!

13:07.156 --> 13:08.290
Agh.

13:08.357 --> 13:09.824
Good luck finding
someone stupid enough

13:09.892 --> 13:11.325
to buy those couches, Donaghy.

13:11.393 --> 13:13.326
Everybody loCate your buddy,

13:13.344 --> 13:15.463
and let's make our way
to the subway.

13:18.433 --> 13:19.566
I'm sorry, sir.

13:19.634 --> 13:23.804
If I could buy your couches,
I would.

13:23.871 --> 13:26.980
You know,
that's exactly what you'll do.

13:27.008 --> 13:27.340
Okay.

13:27.408 --> 13:29.642
And will you accept dancing
as money?

13:29.709 --> 13:31.510
Kenneth.

13:31.578 --> 13:34.647
Drag me to my office.

13:34.714 --> 13:37.650
Agh!

13:41.788 --> 13:44.656
I issued a statement
on your behalf using Twitter.

13:44.723 --> 13:46.558
A media-savvy crackhead,
I know.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.893
I said that you were being
treated for exhaustion

13:48.962 --> 13:50.528
and that you wanted
to thank your fans

13:50.596 --> 13:51.763
for all their support,

13:51.831 --> 13:55.167
and also, you saw Tracy Jordan
do 11 pushups.

13:55.234 --> 13:56.734
I just hope this works.

13:56.802 --> 13:58.070
Well, some of your
former loved ones

13:58.137 --> 13:59.236
are already here.

14:02.207 --> 14:03.707
David Blaine.

14:03.775 --> 14:05.909
I can see that you're
on a skateboard, David.

14:05.978 --> 14:09.847
This is why we broke up, Jenna.

14:09.914 --> 14:12.749
I know we only spent
one night together.

14:12.817 --> 14:14.685
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:14.752 --> 14:16.619
That never happened.
Sure it did.

14:16.687 --> 14:18.188
I ate a pizza slice
off your back.

14:18.255 --> 14:20.123
At one point,
your veneers fell off,

14:20.191 --> 14:21.291
and you had
these little baby fangs.

14:21.359 --> 14:23.126
Thank you, Frank.

14:23.194 --> 14:25.228
It feels like only yesterday

14:25.296 --> 14:26.963
you were in my gym class,
Jenna.

14:27.031 --> 14:29.532
Now, you weren't the only
student I dated,

14:29.600 --> 14:34.436
but you were the only one
who shot my wife.

14:34.504 --> 14:36.438
Jmo, these are
from Mickey Rourke.

14:36.506 --> 14:38.040
No! Tracy, put them down!

14:47.916 --> 14:49.117
I don't know.

14:49.184 --> 14:50.985
Maybe 'cause I'm
a season ticket holder?

14:51.053 --> 14:52.920
Hi, you must be kevi...

14:52.988 --> 14:55.456
no. No, let me fin...

14:55.524 --> 14:56.491
let me finish.

14:56.558 --> 14:57.625
- Are you...
- He's my dad.

14:57.692 --> 14:59.727
It's "take your daughter
to work" day,

14:59.794 --> 15:01.996
which I object to
on feminist grounds.

15:02.064 --> 15:03.163
It's patronizing.

15:03.231 --> 15:04.731
Like girls don't know
what jobs are.

15:04.798 --> 15:05.899
I'm Liz, by the way.

15:05.966 --> 15:07.634
I'm Catherine,
but everyone calls me Cat.

15:07.701 --> 15:09.336
Although I'm trying to get
people at school

15:09.404 --> 15:11.670
to call me scout,
like in <i>to kill a mockingbird.</i>

15:11.738 --> 15:12.804
I love that book.

15:12.872 --> 15:14.573
I had my first crush
on a shop teacher

15:14.641 --> 15:16.342
who looked
just like Boo Radley.

15:16.410 --> 15:19.245
Yeah, scout's not getting
much traction, though.

15:19.312 --> 15:20.413
Well, it's hard
to force a nickname.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.680
I tried to get
my high school tennis team

15:21.748 --> 15:22.948
to call me ace,

15:23.016 --> 15:24.616
but they wanted to call me
shorts accident.

15:24.684 --> 15:27.085
So we settled on supervirgin.

15:27.153 --> 15:28.553
Okay, so I might not get scout,

15:28.620 --> 15:31.156
but I can negotiate up
from puked in thermos.

15:31.223 --> 15:33.224
Well, then,
let me ask you this.

15:33.292 --> 15:34.959
Would Jeremy lin be willing

15:35.027 --> 15:37.995
to videotape a message
for my buddy's bachelor party?

15:38.064 --> 15:40.098
Ugh.

15:40.166 --> 15:41.666
Sorry. She's with me.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.133
It's "take your daughter
to work" day,

15:43.201 --> 15:45.135
and Kabletown's really
into all this family shiz.

15:45.203 --> 15:46.770
So what have you learned today?

15:46.837 --> 15:49.339
That people who talk
the most in meetings

15:49.407 --> 15:50.374
often know the least.

15:50.442 --> 15:51.943
She sat in two meetings
with me.

15:52.168 --> 15:53.213
I crushed it.

15:53.333 --> 15:54.811
So what's your deal?
You ski?

15:54.879 --> 15:57.214
I don't. You know, if I'm
gonna fall down a hill and die,

15:57.282 --> 15:58.481
I want to do it for free.

15:58.549 --> 16:01.184
Brian. What is up, slick?

16:01.251 --> 16:02.722
Do you think
I could pull off a haircut

16:02.750 --> 16:03.914
like scout had in the movie?

16:03.923 --> 16:04.919
I've been there, Cat,

16:04.938 --> 16:05.821
and you should know

16:05.889 --> 16:07.848
that people are gonna assume
that you're...

16:07.886 --> 16:08.857
I'm a lesbian?
I know.

16:08.925 --> 16:11.160
I just needed to hear it.

16:15.529 --> 16:16.994
So, what do you want to
be when you grow up?

16:17.102 --> 16:18.851
Either the wicked queen
in <i>Disney on ice</i>

16:19.206 --> 16:20.872
or the third woman president.

16:20.939 --> 16:23.440
Well played.
I am giving you gum for that.

16:23.508 --> 16:25.609
Where is he?
Where is "kev"?

16:25.677 --> 16:26.677
It's game go.

16:26.745 --> 16:27.844
What are you doing?
What...

16:27.912 --> 16:29.513
game go is not a phrase.
I don't know.

16:29.581 --> 16:31.047
I just got really wound up
at the thought

16:31.115 --> 16:32.516
of you getting checked out
by some creep.

16:32.584 --> 16:33.651
And he's in trouble, too,

16:33.718 --> 16:34.851
'cause I watched
some boxercise videos

16:34.919 --> 16:37.254
on demand
before coming down here.

16:37.322 --> 16:39.322
Hi. I'm Criss.

16:39.390 --> 16:41.491
This is Cat.
This is Kevin's daughter.

16:41.558 --> 16:43.326
She's awesome, unlike Kevin,

16:43.394 --> 16:45.161
who is wearing a rope bracelet.

16:45.228 --> 16:46.362
And I did not give it to him.

16:46.430 --> 16:47.764
People assume I gave it to him,

16:47.831 --> 16:49.332
but I'm like, "you're not
pinning that on me."

16:49.400 --> 16:51.000
I can't believe
you really came down here

16:51.067 --> 16:52.302
to try to fight my date.

16:52.369 --> 16:54.203
That hasn't happened to me
since senior prom,

16:54.271 --> 16:56.405
when Rob Sussman tried
to fight Richard Sallatto

16:56.472 --> 16:58.206
because they had secretly
broken up with each other

16:58.274 --> 17:00.141
the night before.

17:01.411 --> 17:02.911
Why are you so out of breath?

17:02.978 --> 17:04.346
'Cause I ran
all the way down here.

17:04.414 --> 17:05.560
Why didn't you just take
the subway?

17:05.589 --> 17:07.949
'Cause that's not romantic.
Watch a movie, Liz.

17:08.017 --> 17:10.251
I wish my boyfriend
did stuff like this,

17:10.319 --> 17:12.152
but I feel the passion is gone

17:12.220 --> 17:14.555
since he left for college.

17:14.623 --> 17:16.390
I'm totally messing with you.

17:16.458 --> 17:17.458
Guys, I'm 11.

17:17.526 --> 17:18.559
Oh, thank God.

17:18.627 --> 17:20.560
That is not funny, young lady.

17:20.628 --> 17:22.061
It's a little funny.

17:22.130 --> 17:23.698
I'm sorry, j-mo.

17:23.765 --> 17:25.065
I called the front desk,

17:25.133 --> 17:26.400
but there's
no one else down there.

17:26.468 --> 17:28.468
Paul didn't come.

17:28.536 --> 17:31.738
I guess I faked this
stupid breakdown for nothing.

17:31.806 --> 17:33.072
Jenna, I've been thinking.

17:33.140 --> 17:34.374
Why? You're famous.

17:34.442 --> 17:35.375
I know, but I don't think

17:35.443 --> 17:36.509
you were faking anything here.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.578
Maroney, you jumped
through a window.

17:38.646 --> 17:40.179
You made out
with paz de LA huerta

17:40.247 --> 17:41.581
at a children's museum.

17:41.649 --> 17:44.049
You tried to dine at balthazar

17:44.116 --> 17:45.451
without a reservation!

17:45.518 --> 17:47.720
And you did all that to get
some guy's attention.

17:47.787 --> 17:50.622
That's crazy.
That's a breakdown.

17:50.690 --> 17:53.258
I think I've made
the biggest mistake of my life.

17:53.326 --> 17:54.693
I've never made a mistake,

17:54.761 --> 17:56.962
so I don't totally understand,

17:57.029 --> 17:58.231
but I'm here for you, J.

17:58.241 --> 17:59.764
Of all the crazy things I did,

17:59.832 --> 18:01.399
you know what the craziest was?

18:01.467 --> 18:02.800
Letting Paul go.

18:02.868 --> 18:05.770
I was scared to be happy.
Now I never will be.

18:05.838 --> 18:08.305
I'll take this regret
to my grave.

18:08.374 --> 18:09.506
You mean our grave.

18:11.992 --> 18:13.745
Where we'll lie
on top of each other

18:13.812 --> 18:15.346
in one coffin,

18:15.413 --> 18:17.781
pelvis to face, for eternity.

18:17.849 --> 18:19.383
You were here the whole time,

18:19.450 --> 18:20.784
taking care of me.

18:20.852 --> 18:21.885
I was afraid too, Jenna.

18:21.952 --> 18:23.460
I had to be sure
that you wanted

18:23.488 --> 18:24.654
the same thing that I did.

18:24.722 --> 18:25.722
And now I know.

18:25.790 --> 18:28.157
You sick bitch.

18:30.961 --> 18:32.428
Tracy, if you'll excuse us.

18:32.496 --> 18:33.896
No, Paul.

18:33.963 --> 18:36.465
If it wasn't for Tracy,
we wouldn't be here right now.

18:36.533 --> 18:37.492
He can stay.

18:37.612 --> 18:42.438
No, I'm cool.
I'm gonna leave.

18:46.676 --> 18:50.211
- Lemon, how did your date go?
- It was amazing,

18:50.279 --> 18:52.246
but not in the way
that you would expect.

18:52.314 --> 18:53.615
Cat's a great kid, isn't she?

18:53.682 --> 18:55.650
You really thought
I'd set you up with Kevin?

18:55.718 --> 18:57.819
I've been trying to fire him
ever since he invited me out

18:57.887 --> 18:59.487
on a Halloween party bus.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.088
But his daughter's terrific.

19:01.156 --> 19:02.857
So you set me up
on a play date?

19:02.886 --> 19:04.858
I thought Kat
would remind you why

19:04.926 --> 19:07.428
you purchased
the princess Leia costume

19:07.495 --> 19:08.462
in the first place.

19:08.530 --> 19:09.930
Don't give it away just yet.

19:09.997 --> 19:11.164
That's very nice of you, Jack,

19:11.232 --> 19:13.233
but you need to learn
that some women

19:13.301 --> 19:16.202
choose to be childless
and are content with that.

19:16.270 --> 19:17.370
This is not a choice.

19:17.439 --> 19:19.239
Oh, you are being so
trans-vaginal right now.

19:19.307 --> 19:21.841
The past few days
have only confirmed my fear

19:21.909 --> 19:23.342
that we're running out
of good Americans,

19:23.410 --> 19:26.345
so honestly, your country needs

19:26.413 --> 19:27.547
a few more Liz lemons.

19:27.614 --> 19:29.348
Oh. Okay.

19:29.416 --> 19:30.416
So this has nothing
to do with Criss?

19:30.484 --> 19:31.617
I don't care how you do it.

19:31.685 --> 19:33.352
I don't care
if you join the big sisters

19:33.420 --> 19:35.720
and torture inner-city girls
about punctuation.

19:35.788 --> 19:37.522
Any amount of lemon
is better than the crap

19:37.590 --> 19:39.357
we're turning out lately.

19:39.425 --> 19:40.926
Exsqueeze me, Mr. D.

19:40.993 --> 19:42.160
Couches are ready to ship.

19:42.227 --> 19:43.662
In trucks.

19:43.729 --> 19:45.831
Ship in trucks.
What?

19:48.107 --> 19:49.554
Wait, you sold them?
To whom?

19:49.674 --> 19:51.535
I just had to find a buyer
who has too much money

19:51.603 --> 19:52.703
and loves to waste it.

19:52.771 --> 19:55.473
So every defective sofa
that Kouchtown makes

19:55.540 --> 19:56.941
will be purchased
by your beloved

19:57.008 --> 19:58.241
tax-and-spend government.

19:58.309 --> 19:59.276
What are they going
to do with them?

19:59.344 --> 20:01.111
Sink them and make a reef

20:01.179 --> 20:02.379
to protect gay turtles?

20:02.447 --> 20:04.482
I don't know, lemon,
and I don't care.

20:07.551 --> 20:09.418
Mr. wang,
we know you were spying

20:09.487 --> 20:10.987
for north Korean intelligence.

20:11.054 --> 20:12.989
Give me something
I can take back to Langley.

20:13.056 --> 20:14.390
Then we'll get you
out of the couch

20:14.458 --> 20:18.361
and send you home
with a CIA gift bag.

20:21.966 --> 20:23.999
I totally blew off
that week of Korean we did.

20:24.066 --> 20:25.968
Let's get the translator.

20:31.173 --> 20:32.741
- I think maybe I still...
- I don't think you should...

20:32.809 --> 20:35.511
- want to be a mom.
- Give up on having a kid.

20:35.578 --> 20:37.245
Okay.
We're on the same page.

20:37.313 --> 20:39.381
I think we've talked
about it enough.

20:39.448 --> 20:41.148
Maybe we just put a pin in that

20:41.216 --> 20:42.449
and have some fun.

20:42.518 --> 20:43.618
I'll open a puzzle.

20:43.685 --> 20:46.554
I'll make a stew.

20:52.995 --> 20:55.429
Life is happening.

21:00.299 --> 21:03.858
When did gum get so soft,
you sons of bitches?

21:04.427 --> 21:06.060
You know what this country
used to chew?

21:06.128 --> 21:07.262
Tree bark.

21:07.329 --> 21:09.397
Glass.
Shotgun shells.

21:09.464 --> 21:12.066
The broken swords
of our vanquished enemies.

21:12.134 --> 21:15.369
That's why I buy
Bazooka Joe gum.

21:15.437 --> 21:16.805
It's like chewing a Mountain

21:16.872 --> 21:18.940
that someone shot
a freeze ray into.

21:19.008 --> 21:22.042
What's wrong
with this country? Huh?

21:22.110 --> 21:23.911
When did we lose our way?

21:23.978 --> 21:24.912
Detroit?

21:24.979 --> 21:26.980
Life is hard.

21:27.048 --> 21:28.548
Shouldn't everything else
be harder?

21:28.616 --> 21:30.417
Bazooka Joe gum!
