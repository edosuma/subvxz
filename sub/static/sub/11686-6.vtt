WEBVTT

00:08.560 --> 00:12.610
Okay, one extra-large virgin margarita.

00:13.520 --> 00:15.807
- Thank you, Richard.
- What took you so long?

00:15.880 --> 00:18.201
Uh, I actually... Uh, I met a girl.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.323
It's called the bartender, she works here.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.890
No, no. It's a real girl.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.968
And I actually got her real phone number.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.647
Check you out, Mr. Casanova.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.131
Where is this individual?

00:28.680 --> 00:31.206
Um, she's right over there.

00:32.439 --> 00:33.805
The tall dude?

00:34.040 --> 00:35.326
No, behind him.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.051
Oh, she must be hiding behind
that attractive girl in the red sweater.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.600
No, it is the attractive girl in the red sweater.

00:40.680 --> 00:41.806
- Oh...
- Please stop looking at her.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.325
She's magnificent.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.765
You sure it's not the tall guy?

00:44.840 --> 00:49.050
Why are we surprised that young Richard
is garnering the attention of ladies?

00:49.400 --> 00:50.890
After all, he's king again.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.121
Women like that.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.646
Okay, so she's a founder hounder.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.722
Come on, no, it's not like that.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.246
But you did tell her that you're the CEO
of your own company?

00:59.320 --> 01:00.446
it came up.

01:00.520 --> 01:04.081
But I mean, honestly, how else was I going to
explain that me and my friends were at a bar?

01:04.160 --> 01:05.206
That is a good point.

01:05.280 --> 01:08.363
Anytime you're near a woman,
it is important to explain why.

01:08.440 --> 01:10.568
Otherwise, they get nervous.

01:10.840 --> 01:17.246
Gentlemen, to Pied Piper's past,
and now present, CEO.

01:17.320 --> 01:18.560
Oh, what about future?

01:18.960 --> 01:21.247
Jared, we'll worry about that later.

01:21.320 --> 01:23.163
Tonight is about Richard.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.845
To Richard.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.201
I think you'll find I'm a pretty tolerant boss,

01:39.280 --> 01:42.887
but, Gleb, your last commit,
you did use spaces over tabs.

01:43.240 --> 01:45.811
Um, I don't know why you'd commit to that.

01:45.880 --> 01:49.168
Uh, so, just tell me why on Earth
you would do something like that.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.130
<i>Is not so big a deal.
They're very much the same. Yes?</i>

01:52.200 --> 01:54.248
<i>Yes, yes, he's right.
They're very much the same.</i>

01:54.320 --> 01:55.970
No, no, sorry, they're not the same.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.929
At least not in my book. Um, um...

01:58.440 --> 02:00.522
One is right, and the other is wrong.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.961
Why didn't anyone tell Gleb to use tabs?

02:03.040 --> 02:05.361
Yeah, we did.
And it's in the company style guide.

02:05.440 --> 02:09.809
I just don't think Gleb realized
how seriously Richard takes this stuff.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.928
Yeah, I've honestly never
understood it myself.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.924
I mean, once the code
goes through the compiler,

02:15.000 --> 02:16.331
there's effectively no difference.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.131
I know, but coders go, like, batshit over it.

02:19.240 --> 02:23.928
At Hooli, I once saw two engineers
get into a fight so vicious,

02:24.000 --> 02:25.445
they almost made physical contact.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.487
What?

02:26.560 --> 02:28.324
Okay, guys, back to work.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.644
Uh, Gleb, Sanjay, everyone,
do you understand tabs?

02:32.720 --> 02:35.485
<i>Yes, yes. You have made this very clear.
As clear as crystal.</i>

02:35.560 --> 02:36.527
Okay.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.365
Good, that's my little thing,
and I'll hand you back to Dinesh now.

02:39.440 --> 02:44.401
He's the man with the plan,
and the pretty cool tan.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.208
-it's not a tan, it's...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.009
Uh, sorry.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.366
This is how I was born.

02:50.480 --> 02:53.006
Hey, Elisabet. Hi.

02:53.080 --> 02:54.923
Um, before you go, I just wanted to say that

02:55.000 --> 02:58.607
I thought your last commit
was very impressive.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.850
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

03:00.920 --> 03:03.526
Almost as nice as the fingers that typed it.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.361
- Just call it like I see it.
<i>- Thank</i> you.

03:07.440 --> 03:13.083
Speaking of seeing, I will see you tomorrow.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.170
<i>Yes, you Will.</i>

03:15.440 --> 03:16.851
<i>Bye-bye, Dinesh.</i>

03:16.920 --> 03:18.081
Bye, Elisabet.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.361
Yuck.

03:22.480 --> 03:23.720
What?

03:23.840 --> 03:25.729
You don't actually think she was flirting,
do you?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.685
She works here.
She's paid to interact with you.

03:28.760 --> 03:31.331
Just like that bartender
that Richard thought he was flirting with.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.647
Uh, actually, she's not a bartender.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.927
And for your information,
we've been trading texts.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.571
And we're going for drinks later, so...

03:39.080 --> 03:40.320
Great.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.406
If you go to the bar she works at,
you can probably drink for free.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.801
Again, uh, not a bartender.

03:46.480 --> 03:47.845
Okay? She works at Facebook.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.888
So she makes a lot more money
than I do or you do.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.889
And she's definitely not a founder hounder.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.490
So, sorry.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.010
Yeah, none of that adds up.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.082
Hey, guys, check out Code/Rag.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.571
What, did the Gavin piece post?

04:00.640 --> 04:02.085
Indeed it did.

04:03.240 --> 04:04.321
Oh.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.165
"Gavin Belson's Hooli-Scrub Scandal."
Awesome.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.284
Man, Gavin cannot be happy about this.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.560
Stay close.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.246
Back up, back up.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.890
You're on private property.
Back to the sidewalk.

04:25.960 --> 04:26.927
You're gonna get arrested.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.001
Hey, Gavin!

04:28.120 --> 04:29.565
Hello, I'm...

04:31.360 --> 04:33.010
You know, a hundred years ago,

04:33.080 --> 04:35.686
men like me could've
had people like that killed.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.565
Just like that.

04:37.640 --> 04:41.486
You think captains of industry
like Andrew Carnegie or Cornelius Vanderbilt

04:41.560 --> 04:44.166
would've batted an eyelid? Please.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.088
Times sure have changed.

04:50.760 --> 04:51.761
Or have they?

04:53.560 --> 04:54.561
Of course they have.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.930
And for the better.

04:58.520 --> 04:59.726
Unless...

05:02.800 --> 05:03.801
All right, forget it.

05:03.880 --> 05:04.961
What are we doing about this article?

05:05.040 --> 05:07.247
Can we sue this Cantwell woman for libel?

05:07.320 --> 05:11.166
Gavin, libel laws don't really apply
when what's written is true.

05:11.240 --> 05:14.164
It's my understanding you did in fact
instruct Nucleus engineers

05:14.240 --> 05:16.561
-to obscure negative Hooli search...
- I know what I did.

05:16.640 --> 05:20.247
Forget libel. What about this unnamed
Hooli insider she keeps quoting?

05:20.320 --> 05:24.723
Everything this person is saying is obviously
covered by a nondisclosure agreement.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.245
Let's sue that person.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.448
We don't know who that person is.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.723
And reporters generally
don't give up their sources.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.531
Well, then I'll just have to light a fire
under this reporter's ass, won't I?

05:35.040 --> 05:40.922
You know, there was a time, not so long ago,
when it could've been a literal fire.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.571
But, as discussed, those days are gone.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.926
Unless...

05:49.760 --> 05:50.761
All right, forget it.

05:51.160 --> 05:54.323
You people are useless. Thank you.
You're excused.

06:03.040 --> 06:06.965
It's Gavin Belson for C.J. Cantwell, please.
She'll know what it's regarding.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.886
Now, the stage should be here.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.647
With Yeezy or someone comparable.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.803
Now, I have yet to land on a theme.

06:17.880 --> 06:22.488
Most people who rent Alcatraz for parties
tend to go with the prison theme.

06:22.720 --> 06:28.090
How much would it cost to make this look
as if it were never a prison at all?

06:28.400 --> 06:29.811
Spare no expense.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.882
And if you think it would be cool,

06:31.960 --> 06:35.442
I would love to have
some sort of chocolate moat here,

06:35.520 --> 06:39.605
with little boats floating down it filled
with graham crackers and marshmallows.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.569
It's been a childhood dream of mine.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.166
And get the best chocolatier.
We want to impress.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.490
I'm inviting every asshole
from the Valley to attend.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.241
- You're inviting assholes?
- Absolutely.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.049
Assholes, shit dongles.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.603
Any foe or enemy I've made
over my storied career will be here.

06:56.680 --> 07:01.163
That way, when I take the stage
and unleash the power of Bachmanity,

07:01.840 --> 07:03.842
they'll all be in the front row.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.331
Erlich, uh, can we talk for a second?

07:09.080 --> 07:10.081
What is it, Big Head?

07:10.200 --> 07:11.804
I thought I told you to go
watch something on your iPad.

07:11.880 --> 07:13.405
I think we may have a problem.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.448
That Code/Rag reporter I talked to

07:15.520 --> 07:18.330
says that Gavin Belson
is threatening to sue her

07:18.400 --> 07:20.084
if she doesn't tell him who she spoke to.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.166
- So?
- So, she spoke to me.

07:23.240 --> 07:26.403
No publicity is bad publicity.
This might be great timing.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.484
Exactly the reason that we are partners.

07:29.560 --> 07:33.645
Okay, yeah, except if Gavin finds out
it was me that talked to the reporter,

07:33.720 --> 07:35.802
then he'll know I violated my NDA.

07:35.880 --> 07:39.362
And then he could come after
my entire settlement if that happens.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.646
All two million.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.563
I mean, 20 million.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.846
Big Head, I'm not going to yell.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.770
And I'm not going to hit you.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.043
I'm just gonna ask you nicely,

07:51.880 --> 07:55.805
why in the holy fuck didn't you tell me
you signed an NDA,

07:55.880 --> 07:58.724
you sweet, helpless little piece of shit?

07:58.800 --> 08:00.484
Well, that's the thing about the NDA,

08:00.560 --> 08:03.723
is that the NDA is actually covered
under the NDA.

08:03.800 --> 08:07.247
So if I told you about the NDA,
it would've been a violation of the NDA.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.244
And what about speaking with the reporter?
What would that be?

08:11.240 --> 08:13.083
Yeah. Shit.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.967
So, what do you think I should do?

08:17.040 --> 08:18.690
- I could call her back and...
- No.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.650
Let me handle it.
You go wait in the helicopter.

08:21.720 --> 08:22.767
- Okay.
- Go.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.763
Sasha, I'm going to need to go back
to the mainland.

08:27.840 --> 08:28.841
Oh, is there a problem?

08:28.920 --> 08:31.605
Oh, no, no, no. Full steam ahead.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.284
Mainland.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.610
This is an island.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.283
That's the theme.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.725
Hawaiian.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.404
We'll have a luau.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.208
Yeah, somebody
called me that in high school,

08:46.280 --> 08:47.884
and the nickname just stuck.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.930
<i>Pakistani Denzel?</i>

08:50.000 --> 08:53.721
I mean, I don't see it.
But everybody else does. So...

08:54.120 --> 08:57.727
<i>Maybe they should call him American Dinesh?</i>

08:57.800 --> 08:59.370
Stop.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.124
<i>Only if you stop first.</i>

09:01.200 --> 09:02.929
- No, you stop first.
- You <i>stop first.</i>

09:03.000 --> 09:04.809
<i>- You go first.
- No, I think you should.</i>

09:04.880 --> 09:07.121
Okay, I'll stop. Bye.

09:07.640 --> 09:08.846
What's your end game here?

09:08.920 --> 09:10.490
You think after your tired rap,

09:10.560 --> 09:13.484
she's going to hop on a plane,
fly halfway across the world,

09:14.360 --> 09:15.407
and fuck you?

09:15.480 --> 09:17.005
My motivations are pure.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.568
Her and I have, like, a real connection.

09:19.640 --> 09:22.530
She's so, like, nice
and she's so down-to-Earth,

09:22.600 --> 09:26.525
that it's like she has no idea
how attractive she is.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.608
You don't know how attractive she is.

09:28.680 --> 09:31.729
Packet loss over Estonian broadband
is terrible.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.001
She could be hideous.

09:33.080 --> 09:36.163
Well, I can't imagine that would matter
to Dinesh one iota.

09:37.840 --> 09:38.841
Right.

09:38.920 --> 09:43.005
'Cause she's nice and very talented
and has a great laugh.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.048
And with any luck, she's not a dogface.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.610
How was your date with Winnie?

09:49.280 --> 09:52.966
Uh, well, pretty good,
considering she's still in the other room.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.168
Baller, you got lucky on the first date.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.568
Yeah, did a little bit, not everything.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.449
I mean, I slept in my jeans.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.842
Well, take your time. Hunger is the best sauce.

10:02.920 --> 10:04.570
You're right. Uh...

10:04.640 --> 10:07.769
We did a little bit of under the shirts
and light finger banging.

10:08.320 --> 10:09.560
Oh, hey.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.604
- Hey, I'm Winnie.
- Oh.

10:17.720 --> 10:18.960
Hi, I'm Dinesh.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.405
Hi, I'm Jared.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.251
- It is an honor to meet you.
- Okay.

10:23.640 --> 10:24.926
God, what a pleasure.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.361
Thanks.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.046
I'm Gilfoyle.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.246
Are you a bartender?

10:30.560 --> 10:32.050
I work at Facebook.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.606
As a bartender?

10:33.680 --> 10:35.603
I had a stuffed animal named Winnie.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.681
Oh, wow.

10:36.760 --> 10:37.921
I mean,
it wasn't technically an animal,

10:38.000 --> 10:41.209
I took a Ziploc bag
and I stuffed it with old newspaper,

10:41.280 --> 10:42.805
and then I drew a smile on it.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.167
Okay, well, shall we have some coffee,
milady?

10:45.240 --> 10:47.481
- Sure. Let's do it.
- Okay. All right.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.241
We're already on to Elizabethan nicknames.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.090
This is serious.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.164
They'll be Ren Faire-ing soon.

10:54.240 --> 10:55.287
It's healthy.

10:56.320 --> 11:01.406
And now that Richard's dating, in solidarity,
I think I might get back out there myself.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.201
You make it sound like
you've chosen not to date.

11:04.280 --> 11:07.011
Yeah, absolutely.
I wanted to focus on Pied Piper.

11:07.080 --> 11:11.324
But, yeah, maybe now I'll fan
out my plumage, so to speak,

11:11.440 --> 11:14.523
and see what pretty birdies
might share my nest.

11:15.160 --> 11:18.050
Hey, Jared, if you fuck any pretty birdies
in my server room,

11:18.120 --> 11:19.884
put a tie on the doorknob, won't you?

11:19.960 --> 11:22.167
As a signal. Yeah, good thinking.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.931
Okay, so I'll just get the car keys,
and then give you a lift home.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.126
Okay, milady?

11:27.280 --> 11:29.169
- Milord.
- Oh, milady.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.121
Okay.

11:33.200 --> 11:37.330
So, Richard tells me you guys are building
deep nets into your platform?

11:37.400 --> 11:38.606
Oh, really?

11:38.680 --> 11:41.206
What other company secrets
did he blab to you?

11:41.280 --> 11:44.443
Well, I'm a bartender. I wouldn’t understand
all the science-y talk, right?

11:44.640 --> 11:45.641
Touché.

11:45.720 --> 11:48.007
So you do AI at Facebook?

11:48.080 --> 11:52.051
No, but when I was at MIT,
I did my master's thesis on game-playing AIs.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.690
I did a lot of machine learning stuff.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.444
For gaming? How does that work?

11:55.520 --> 11:56.521
It's on my GitHub.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.840
Do you want to check it out?

11:58.160 --> 11:59.889
Gavin said he was gonna haul me into court,

11:59.960 --> 12:03.726
and have a judge compel me
to give up my source or go to jail.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.404
Okay? I am not going to jail.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.887
No, no one's going to jail, C.J.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.521
Although, if you did,
going to jail for protecting your source

12:11.600 --> 12:14.285
would make you some kind of
First Amendment hero.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.567
It's pretty much the best thing
that can happen to a journalist.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.404
Journalist? I'm a tech blogger, okay?

12:18.480 --> 12:20.562
I write stories for the Internet
about the Internet.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.483
I am not going to jail for that.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.325
I know it is an inconsequential shit job.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.764
It doesn't really contribute to culture
in any way whatsoever.

12:28.840 --> 12:32.083
We've established
that you don't have any journalistic integrity,

12:32.160 --> 12:37.371
but what would it cost to buy you some?

12:41.680 --> 12:42.886
...and then I figured out a way

12:42.960 --> 12:45.884
to train a convolutional net
to play Atari 2600 games.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.689
- Uh-oh.
- What?

12:48.040 --> 12:49.246
Spaces.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.722
Yeah, so what, you guys use tabs?

12:51.800 --> 12:53.564
In this house, yes.

12:53.640 --> 12:58.043
Richard is a bit of a zealot
in the Tabs V. Spaces holy war.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.969
I get that, for his company. Sure.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.883
This goes much deeper.

13:01.960 --> 13:05.089
I think he believes that people
who use spaces are less than.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.248
- Huh...
- I wouldn't mention this to Richard.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.925
You don't want to see him throw a hissy fit.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.207
Okay. Shall we away, milady?

13:13.520 --> 13:14.646
Nice to meet you guys.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.051
Have fun.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.522
- Bye.
- Bye.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.202
I actually kind of liked her.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.731
Too bad Richard's going to fuck it up.

13:24.280 --> 13:26.931
So, you moved the swimming pool?

13:27.400 --> 13:31.644
Yeah, it just felt like it was way too far
from the house, like, crazy far.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.485
So I had this company come
and just move it closer.

13:34.560 --> 13:38.007
Uh-huh. But then you moved it back?

13:38.520 --> 13:41.490
Yeah, turns out the guy who built this place
knew exactly what he was doing,

13:41.560 --> 13:45.326
and the pool was right where it needed to be
the whole time.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.165
But now I know that for sure,
which feels good.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.846
Nelson, do you like being wealthy?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.570
Yeah, oh, man, it's awesome.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.165
So you want to stay wealthy?

13:54.240 --> 13:56.527
- Okay, yeah, sure.
- Great.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.841
Here are the three things
you need to do, all right?

13:58.920 --> 14:01.446
One, stop moving the swimming pool.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.161
Oh, yeah, okay, I can do that. What else?

14:04.280 --> 14:08.126
Two, you need to manage your expenses
and track your receipts

14:08.240 --> 14:11.608
a little bit better than this.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.968
I'm only as good as the information I have.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.047
Oh, you're great.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.088
No, I wasn't fishing for compliments.

14:17.200 --> 14:21.569
And three, I sense that people
are taking advantage of you.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.609
Oh, sorry, hold on.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.890
Oh, it's Erlich, I should probably grab this.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.962
Erlich Bachman, a perfect example.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.884
You gave him signing power
on your personal checking account?

14:30.960 --> 14:32.200
Yeah, he's my business partner.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.363
You're not structured as a corporation.
You're a general partnership.

14:35.440 --> 14:38.171
So he's essentially your spouse.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.129
That's very dangerous.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.281
But I trust him.

14:41.400 --> 14:44.324
He's actually trying to save us money
right now, so hold on.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.401
Hey, man.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.448
Big Head, wondrous news.

14:48.520 --> 14:51.729
I eliminated the Gavin problem,
and at the exact same time,

14:51.800 --> 14:54.804
I closed funding
on our first strategic investment.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.730
We bought a blog.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.322
Oh, cool. How much do blogs cost?

14:59.400 --> 15:00.401
What?

15:00.480 --> 15:02.562
Oh, nothing. We practically stole it from them.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.130
What?

15:04.200 --> 15:05.611
I'm bullshitting.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.371
Half a million dollars.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.521
Let me talk to him, please.

15:08.640 --> 15:12.486
Uh, hey, hey, Erlich, could you talk to
my business manager for a second?

15:12.560 --> 15:15.006
No, I've got to jet, but tell him
I'll see him at the party.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.286
Good day, partner.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.125
Okay, cool.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.324
About the blog...

15:20.600 --> 15:22.602
- Five hundred grand.
- Oh, God.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.762
I know, we practically stole it, right?

15:25.800 --> 15:27.928
<i>Your roommates are really funny.
I like them.</i>

15:28.000 --> 15:29.604
They gave me a little shit.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.928
Oh, well, you can't take that personally.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.401
Oh, it's fine. They gave you shit, too.

15:34.480 --> 15:37.370
Really? What about, like,
my hair or something?

15:37.440 --> 15:41.490
No. They tried to convince me you were
some sort of formatting Nazi

15:41.560 --> 15:44.040
about tabs versus spaces.

15:45.120 --> 15:49.205
What? Me? A Nazi? That's ridiculous.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.329
That's what I said, I mean, I use spaces.
So what?

15:52.440 --> 15:53.965
Mmm...

15:54.040 --> 15:55.883
Yeah, so what?

15:55.960 --> 15:58.281
See, they said you'd have
a hissy fit if you found out.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.362
Mmm-mmm. Hissy fit. Me? No.

16:00.520 --> 16:01.487
I know.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.324
You know. I know.

16:03.440 --> 16:04.487
I mean, make up your mind, guys,

16:04.560 --> 16:06.801
am I a Nazi or am I
a guy who throws hissy fits, you know?

16:06.880 --> 16:09.121
Am I a Nazi who throws hissy fits?

16:09.200 --> 16:11.521
I hope not. That was Hitler.
That was, like, his whole deal.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.841
I mean, that's pretty insensitive
to the Holocaust, don't you think?

16:13.920 --> 16:16.526
'Cause that's, like, what Hitler did.
You know, he just, like,

16:16.600 --> 16:19.171
killed so many people,
so tragic, such a tragic time.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.527
- Yeah.
- I'm so glad we're not doing that anymore.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.410
I mean, we, like I was, you know...

16:24.520 --> 16:26.921
I want them all to die. I don't. I don't care.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.162
I mean, I do care. Don't kill them.

16:29.240 --> 16:30.526
Them... Jews.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.962
Uh, anyway, what do you want to order here?

16:35.280 --> 16:37.487
Is that our P2P protocol?

16:37.600 --> 16:39.011
Yeah, I'm just hacking for fun.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.811
I figured out a way to use our compression
for RTC, so...

16:42.080 --> 16:43.081
Video chat?

16:43.160 --> 16:45.527
Yeah, I think it could be better resolution
than Hooli-Chat.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.170
Even over 3G.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.891
It could just be, like, a fun, cool feature
in the platform, you know.

16:49.960 --> 16:54.602
And then coincidentally you'll finally be able
to see what Elisabet actually looks like.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.843
- Oh, yeah.
- Huh.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.365
I hadn't thought of that.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.010
If you worked half as hard on the platform

17:00.120 --> 17:02.771
as you do trying to ogle
strange Slavic women,

17:03.080 --> 17:05.481
maybe our shares would
finally be worth something.

17:05.720 --> 17:06.800
Hey, uh...

17:08.400 --> 17:10.128
What the hell was that?

17:15.119 --> 17:17.009
Can you give us slightly more, Richard?

17:17.920 --> 17:24.371
Why did you tell Winnie that I think people
who use spaces over tabs are stupid?

17:24.839 --> 17:25.921
Because you do.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.001
No, I don't.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.605
And if I did, which I don't,

17:29.000 --> 17:30.923
why would you say that
behind my back to her?

17:31.000 --> 17:34.561
I mean, things were just
going so well, until she...

17:34.640 --> 17:38.042
That was completely lovely.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.571
Yeah, it was really nice.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.881
You're really something.
I'll give you a call later, okay?

17:41.960 --> 17:44.406
Okay, cool, yeah. Great, sounds good.

17:44.800 --> 17:45.847
Bye, Jared.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.086
Bye.

18:02.880 --> 18:03.927
Jared?

18:04.360 --> 18:05.361
Yeah?

18:05.680 --> 18:06.886
Who was that?

18:07.360 --> 18:08.964
Oh, that was Carol.

18:10.920 --> 18:16.848
So, uh, Jared, did you just have sex with her?

18:20.560 --> 18:21.686
What?

18:21.760 --> 18:22.886
I'm an adult,

18:22.960 --> 18:25.770
and like the rest of you, I'm a sexual being.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.204
You fucked her in the garage?

18:28.360 --> 18:31.569
Well, it's the server room and my bedroom.

18:31.640 --> 18:35.042
What, so you just meet a woman,

18:35.440 --> 18:37.442
and then you have sex with her?

18:39.920 --> 18:41.365
How often does this happen?

18:41.720 --> 18:46.442
Well, if you're asking me how many times
I've been in love, the answer is two.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.484
But the rest, I won't talk about.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.085
It's untoward.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.840
Russ was right, this guy fucks.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.124
Who was that gorgeous gazelle
in the driveway?

18:57.240 --> 18:59.607
Well, I've said all I care to, let's move on.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.569
She let Jared have sex with her.

19:01.840 --> 19:05.083
Jared, nice. Using that dick.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.250
Gents,

19:07.320 --> 19:14.010
I'd like to invite you to what promises to be
the social event of the season.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.567
Bachmanity Insanity.

19:18.560 --> 19:19.846
Alcatraz?

19:19.920 --> 19:22.082
Don't worry, it will be unrecognizable.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.242
Jared, with regards to the...

19:25.040 --> 19:26.326
You need a plus one?

19:26.600 --> 19:29.524
Oh, no, thank you.
I think it's too early for that.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.601
Good idea.

19:30.680 --> 19:33.331
Don't bring sand to the beach,
there's already pussy there.

19:33.440 --> 19:37.126
Richard, I assume you'll be taking
your woman friend?

19:37.440 --> 19:38.885
You know what? Yes.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.201
She and I will be there together.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.361
I'm going to make this work,

19:42.440 --> 19:46.570
despite all your little attempts
to sabotage my relationship.

19:46.640 --> 19:49.325
You can do anything
you put your mind to, Richard.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.483
Including turning Alcatraz into Hawaii.

20:04.640 --> 20:05.926
You Okay?

20:06.520 --> 20:08.568
Yeah. Yeah, all good. Great.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.850
- You know...
- What?

20:15.280 --> 20:17.442
My roommate's going out of town tomorrow,

20:17.520 --> 20:20.524
so if we want to come back here
after Erlich's party...

20:20.600 --> 20:24.685
Oh. Okay, yeah.
Sure, that sounds good to me.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.250
All right, it's a date.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.084
See you then.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.766
Richard, what's wrong?

20:42.840 --> 20:45.844
Nothing. Nothing. Literally, it's all good.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.366
Come on.

20:51.440 --> 20:52.771
- Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.330
Your roommates were right,
you really hate spaces.

20:54.440 --> 20:55.771
No,no,no.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.889
I don't... It's not hate.
Hate's a strong word. Um...

20:58.960 --> 21:01.964
Truth be told,
I do have a slight preference for tabs.

21:02.040 --> 21:07.206
But that's only because I'm anal
and because I prefer precision.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.410
Well, not to pick a fight here,

21:11.480 --> 21:15.041
but if you really care about precision,
wouldn't you use spaces?

21:15.920 --> 21:17.285
- N...
- But whatever.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.442
Once it goes through the compiler,
it's the same thing, right?

21:20.640 --> 21:22.881
Yeah. Yeah, technically, yes.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.126
I guess I just don't understand why you...

21:31.200 --> 21:32.850
Anyone would use spaces over tabs.

21:32.920 --> 21:35.969
Like, if it's all the same,
why not just use tabs?

21:36.040 --> 21:38.486
Because it could look different
on other people's computers.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.847
Tabs create smaller file sizes, all right?

21:40.920 --> 21:42.001
I run a compression company.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.970
Trust me, I've devoted my life
to minimalizing file sizes.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.371
It's what I do.

21:46.440 --> 21:50.490
I mean, I do not get why anyone would use
spaces over tabs.

21:50.560 --> 21:53.325
I mean, why not just use Vim over Emacs?

21:53.400 --> 21:54.925
I do use Vim over Emac.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.280
Oh, God, help us!

21:56.360 --> 21:57.566
Okay. Uh...

21:58.080 --> 21:59.081
You know what?

21:59.160 --> 22:01.447
I just... I don't think this is going to work.
I'm so sorry.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.487
I mean, like, what?

22:02.560 --> 22:05.211
We're going to bring kids into this world
with that over their heads?

22:05.280 --> 22:06.645
That's not really fair to them, don't you think?

22:06.760 --> 22:08.762
Kids? We haven't even slept together.

22:08.840 --> 22:10.251
And guess what,
it's never going to happen now,

22:10.320 --> 22:15.042
because there is no way I'm going to be
with someone who uses spaces over tabs.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.331
Richard.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.563
Wow, okay.

22:23.640 --> 22:24.801
Good bye.

22:24.880 --> 22:27.167
One tab saves you eight spaces.

22:30.400 --> 22:31.401
on!

22:35.160 --> 22:36.161
Oh, my God!

22:36.440 --> 22:37.805
Richard, what happened?

22:37.880 --> 22:41.009
I just tried to go down the stairs
eight steps at a time.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.171
I'm okay, though.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.126
See you around, Richard.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.201
Just making a point.

22:57.800 --> 22:58.801
Huh.

22:59.280 --> 23:03.569
This new video chat protocol
is making your image crystal clear.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.961
<i>Wait one second, Dinesh.</i>

23:06.360 --> 23:08.727
<i>Uh, Dinesh, I can't see you, it's all black.</i>

23:08.800 --> 23:13.488
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't give the camera
permission to access the video chat, hold on.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.244
Boom!

23:15.320 --> 23:18.130
<i>Yes, I can see you now.</i>

23:18.200 --> 23:19.247
It's me!

23:19.320 --> 23:21.163
Pakistani Denzel!

23:23.080 --> 23:24.161
<i>Yes.</i>

23:24.240 --> 23:27.084
<i>The Denzel who is from Pakistan.</i>

23:27.160 --> 23:30.369
This video quality is great, right?
Looks so sharp.

23:31.680 --> 23:34.524
That's what we do here at Pied Piper.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.529
<i>It's very impressive.</i>

23:38.760 --> 23:42.845
<i>Um, I will have to tell
my boyfriend all about it.</i>

23:43.160 --> 23:44.207
Boyfriend?

23:44.720 --> 23:46.609
You never mentioned a boyfriend.

23:46.680 --> 23:48.125
Oh, no? Um...

23:48.880 --> 23:51.531
<i>This is because he's now just husband.</i>

23:51.840 --> 23:55.049
<i>Um, I keep forgetting to say this, husband,</i>

23:55.160 --> 24:00.963
<i>but it is very good to see you this way,
and we will talk more tomorrow.</i>

24:01.320 --> 24:03.084
Yeah, we'll talk...

24:05.080 --> 24:08.880
Either she froze time,

24:09.480 --> 24:12.529
met and married the man of her dreams,

24:12.760 --> 24:16.731
unfroze time, and hopped back
on to vid chat with you,

24:16.920 --> 24:20.322
or you're the dogface.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.482
Which do you think it is?

24:24.560 --> 24:25.891
I'm on the fence.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.286
What the fuck is going on?

24:27.400 --> 24:32.042
Richard found a girl, you have a girlfriend,
Jared is getting laid with a girl.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.245
Hi, Mom.

25:01.800 --> 25:02.801
Oh, God.

25:02.880 --> 25:05.087
Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, Winnie.

25:05.160 --> 25:07.288
Sweet, sweet Elisabet.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.321
Gentlemen, mahalo for coming.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.923
You must taste the breaded
humuhumunukunukuapua'a,

25:15.520 --> 25:17.727
flown in fresh this a.m.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.690
What is mumu...

25:20.160 --> 25:21.321
It's breaded.

25:21.400 --> 25:22.367
Get ready.

25:22.440 --> 25:27.321
In T-minus five minutes,
Big Head and I are going to take that stage,

25:27.400 --> 25:31.166
and I am going to
ejaculate my success all over

25:31.240 --> 25:34.084
the faces and hair of my fiercest rivals.

25:34.280 --> 25:38.569
Like some sort of vengeful
viscous web of payback.

25:38.760 --> 25:40.410
- Erlich?
- Yes.

25:40.480 --> 25:41.481
One moment.

25:41.680 --> 25:44.570
- Sasha, you are doing an exceptional job.
- Oh.

25:44.640 --> 25:48.565
I mean, I see no evidence
that we are not in Hawaii.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.041
Hmm. We have a problem.

25:51.120 --> 25:54.488
Just, several of our vendors are saying
that your checks have bounced.

25:58.080 --> 26:01.721
Uh, Sasha, <i>hikiki'i.</i> I'll be back.

26:02.520 --> 26:03.931
Big Head, Big Head.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.246
Why are our checks bouncing?

26:05.320 --> 26:07.402
If you had responded
to any of my phone calls,

26:07.480 --> 26:09.323
I would've explained it to you.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.765
And who the fuck are you?

26:10.920 --> 26:15.050
Uh, Erlich,
this is my business manager, Arthur...

26:15.600 --> 26:16.567
Klaiman.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.369
Klaiman. I knew it was something with Clay.

26:18.720 --> 26:20.802
As I was explaining to Mr. Bighetti,

26:20.880 --> 26:24.680
I've finally managed to get a handle
on his finances.

26:24.760 --> 26:27.684
Our finances. Continue.

26:27.760 --> 26:31.685
After your considerable outlay on lifestyle,

26:32.120 --> 26:35.124
this party and half a million dollars
on a website,

26:35.200 --> 26:38.761
you're functionally insolvent.

26:40.280 --> 26:41.884
Big Head, you're broke?

26:42.120 --> 26:43.360
We're broke, dude.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.601
Erlich, it's time.

26:44.680 --> 26:48.082
You have my number.
I left it on your voice mail.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.250
Several times.

26:50.640 --> 26:54.964
<i>Titans of the tech world,
I give you Nelson Bighetti, Erlich Bachman</i>

26:55.040 --> 26:58.806
<i>and Bachmanity!</i>

27:12.920 --> 27:16.447
<i>- Aloha.
- Uh, that means hello.</i>

27:19.720 --> 27:20.767
<i>Oh, and goodbye.</i>
