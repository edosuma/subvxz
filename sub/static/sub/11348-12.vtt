In the criminal justice system,

00:03.003 --> 00:04.472
sexually based offenses

00:04.505 --> 00:07.175
are considered
especially heinous.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.210
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.243 --> 00:11.212
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.245 --> 00:12.413
are members of an elite squad

00:12.446 --> 00:14.482
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.784
These are their stories.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.220
[elevator chimes]

00:32.166 --> 00:33.501
Hey.
Can I help you?

00:33.534 --> 00:34.535
Yeah.
Where's Nicky?

00:34.568 --> 00:36.504
- Who?
- Nicky Amaro.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.106
I'm his sergeant.
And you are?

00:38.139 --> 00:39.207
You're the sergeant?

00:39.240 --> 00:41.475
I'm the father.
[laughs]

00:41.509 --> 00:42.476
You're Nick's dad?

00:42.510 --> 00:43.844
Yeah, Nicolas.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.214
How are you?

00:46.247 --> 00:48.682
My son never told me
his boss was so...

00:48.716 --> 00:50.218
encantadora.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.252
Okay.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.486
Why don't you have a seat

00:52.520 --> 00:53.654
and I'll let him know
that you're here.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.756
Thank you.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.858
Nick.
What's your name?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.360
Yeah.
She wanted it.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.329
I'm sure she did.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.231
First of all,
she was hot.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.232
Okay.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.134
Okay, hot.
Got it.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.568
Nick.
You got a minute?

01:10.838 --> 01:12.206
(Nicolas)
Some people roll them--

01:12.240 --> 01:13.807
he unrolled them!
[Carisi laughs]

01:13.841 --> 01:15.543
(Carisi)
Wait, wait, wait,
how old was he?

01:15.576 --> 01:17.245
(Nicolas)
Five. Hand to God.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.446
I come home, he's cutting up
my Montecristos.

01:18.479 --> 01:19.713
I said, "What are you doing?"

01:19.747 --> 01:22.716
He says, "Smoking
is very bad for you."

01:22.750 --> 01:24.785
Speak of the devil.
Nicky.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.187
What are you doing here?

01:26.220 --> 01:27.588
Aw...

01:27.621 --> 01:29.290
You see how he
talks to his father?

01:29.323 --> 01:31.425
I just come by.
Just to say hello.

01:31.459 --> 01:32.793
To talk.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.263
Yeah?
Well, I'm working.

01:35.296 --> 01:38.199
Sergeant, would you mind
if I took my son to lunch?

01:38.232 --> 01:39.099
It would mean
a lot to me.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.768
Uh, I don't know if
now's the best time.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.670
No. I got it.
I can mop up with Fin.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.738
You know, that's nice.
You got real friends here.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.740
What do you say,
big guy, huh?

01:46.774 --> 01:48.442
You still like Chinese?

01:51.912 --> 01:54.315
- I'll be 20 minutes.
- Okay.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.286
You want to go?
Let's go.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.120
Good people, huh?

02:01.622 --> 02:03.824
Hey, you'd think after all
these years on the job,

02:03.857 --> 02:06.727
you might have your own
office by now, though.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.229
I've barely seen you
since I was 15.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.230
You can't
just show up--

02:09.263 --> 02:10.731
Nicky, look.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.666
I'm throwing a party
and I need you to come.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.535
I want you to come.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.737
Please.

02:16.770 --> 02:17.838
That's not happening.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.240
It is happening.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.674
It's a rehearsal dinner.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.876
I'm getting married,
Nick.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.612
I'm in love.

02:27.315 --> 02:30.284
[dramatic music]

03:14.428 --> 03:14.662
.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.095
How old is she? 25?

03:16.530 --> 03:19.533
Gabriella?
Come on. She's 28.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.001
Her whole family
moved here

03:21.034 --> 03:24.572
from a little village
down in the D.R.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.474
So why are you getting
married here anyway?

03:26.507 --> 03:27.741
I don't know.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.677
Kind of outgrown
Miami, you know?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.612
What am I gonna
do at my age?

03:31.645 --> 03:33.481
Die of an early
bird special?

03:33.514 --> 03:36.617
Well, Gabriella's folks
are here now, so...

03:36.650 --> 03:37.818
Well, you're
not moving back.

03:37.851 --> 03:38.952
I might.
Ooh!

03:38.986 --> 03:40.388
You know,
I've got a lead.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.522
I've got to show
you something.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.823
Mixed martial arts gym.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.825
Look at this.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.560
- Beautiful, right?
- Yeah, it's nice.

03:46.594 --> 03:47.628
You should come by.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.597
It feels good
to hit something.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.367
Do you hear yourself?

03:53.401 --> 03:54.702
Hey, Nicky, you know,

03:54.735 --> 03:56.036
whatever happened
between me and your mom

03:56.069 --> 03:58.038
in your imagination,
you know, it's over.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.507
She's over it.
We're all over it.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.841
Oh, you two are talking?

04:00.874 --> 04:01.842
Yeah, we talk.
We talk all the time.

04:01.875 --> 04:02.843
We talk about you,

04:02.876 --> 04:03.844
we talk about your sister,

04:03.877 --> 04:05.446
we talk about everything.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.880
She worries about you.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.484
She knows how hard
it's been on you.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.886
When Maria walked out with
your daughter like that.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.555
Nick, I don't want
you talking about me.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.457
And I don't want you
talking about Zara.

04:16.490 --> 04:19.327
Okay. Let's talk
about your son.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.528
All these years,

04:20.561 --> 04:22.630
you don't even
know about him?

04:22.663 --> 04:23.764
It's a shame, Nicky.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.399
It was nice seeing you,
Nicolas.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.635
Let's do this again
in another 20 years.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.470
Don't walk out
on me, Nick.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.004
Don't walk out on me.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.043
How'd that go?

04:36.076 --> 04:39.012
So Nicolas Fiorello Amaro
is getting married.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.481
Again.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.416
To a child bride,
and he wants me to come.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.584
Okay.
And?

04:43.617 --> 04:44.552
Well, since going
would require

04:44.585 --> 04:47.788
pretending that he and I
have a relationship...

04:47.821 --> 04:48.889
I hear you.

04:48.922 --> 04:49.890
Or that what
happened in our home

04:49.923 --> 04:51.425
didn't actually happen...

04:51.459 --> 04:52.926
Nick, you have every
right to be upset--

04:52.960 --> 04:54.528
He doesn't get
to wipe the slate.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.530
It's not about him.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.832
This is about you

04:58.866 --> 05:00.501
holding on to your anger.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.403
Okay? I've learned that
in order to heal,

05:02.436 --> 05:04.572
we have to let go.

05:04.605 --> 05:05.539
Oh, so, what, you've
forgiven your father?

05:05.573 --> 05:07.775
Or William Lewis?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.510
Huh?
Have you forgiven them?

05:12.813 --> 05:13.814
Wow.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.419
Look, I'm sorry, I--

05:30.498 --> 05:31.832
(Amaro)
You're talking to him?

05:34.435 --> 05:36.103
You're really going
to this charade?

05:36.136 --> 05:38.506
I promised your sister.

05:38.539 --> 05:39.873
She just wants
everyone to be happy.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.510
No, she wants
Nicolas to be happy.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.878
Hey, how much money has
she borrowed from him?

05:44.912 --> 05:46.013
Ah.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.081
Sonya had it tough
for a long time.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.650
Things never came
easily for her

05:49.683 --> 05:51.419
the way they
did for you.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.053
Yeah, well I worked hard
for everything I got.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.588
I didn't go out partying.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.390
I didn't ring up
credit card debt.

05:56.424 --> 05:57.991
[doorbell buzzes]

05:58.025 --> 05:59.727
Just be nice.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.429
She's your sister.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.596
Wait, she's here?

06:02.630 --> 06:03.897
She flew in from L.A.?

06:03.931 --> 06:06.700
[overlapping greetings]

06:06.734 --> 06:08.502
Daddy!

06:08.536 --> 06:11.138
Hey, Zara.
What are you doing here?

06:12.973 --> 06:14.442
Nobody told me.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.009
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.545
I had bonus miles

06:17.578 --> 06:19.780
and convinced Maria it was
such a special occasion.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.984
Wow. Look at you.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.986
You never age.
You son of a bitch.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.588
Hey.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.189
Daddy, I have a new
dress for the wedding.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.190
I'm a flower girl!

06:30.223 --> 06:31.191
Really?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.527
Wow.

06:33.561 --> 06:36.630
Look, why don't
you let Abuelita

06:36.664 --> 06:38.499
help you put
that dress on?

06:38.532 --> 06:40.434
I really want to see it.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.802
[speaking Spanish]

06:47.007 --> 06:48.609
Nicolas put you
up to this?

06:48.642 --> 06:50.043
Oh, gosh, I figured
you'd be upset,

06:50.077 --> 06:51.479
but I knew once
we got here--

06:51.512 --> 06:52.780
No, I already told
him I'm not going.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.114
And guilting
Mom into this--

06:54.147 --> 06:55.449
I didn't!

06:55.483 --> 06:56.750
Either way,
Zara's not going.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.486
It was Mom's idea.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.753
You set me up.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.622
See, if I tell that
little girl she can't go,

07:01.655 --> 07:03.090
she'll be heartbroken.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.525
If you're worried about
her coming out tonight,

07:04.558 --> 07:05.526
then why don't you come?

07:05.559 --> 07:06.794
I got to go back to work.

07:06.827 --> 07:07.795
All right?

07:07.828 --> 07:09.129
Just let me...

07:09.162 --> 07:10.831
spend a little bit
of time with Zara.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.804
It is good to see you.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.572
But if you are
going to take her

07:18.606 --> 07:20.574
to this party,
do me a favor.

07:20.608 --> 07:23.544
Just take it
easy for once.

07:25.579 --> 07:28.616
What is that
supposed to mean?

07:28.649 --> 07:30.618
[energetic Latin music]

07:30.651 --> 07:32.520
Get me one of those mojitos
and I'll love you forever.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.954
Hold that thought.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.523
I'll be right back.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.657
Look Abuelita.
We're sitting together.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.592
Oh!
How did that happen?

07:38.626 --> 07:41.094
You don't believe she's marrying
an old goat like me, right?

07:41.128 --> 07:43.564
After you fall out of the bed,
I fall into the bed.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.766
I'm the lucky one.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.669
Hey! It's not some kind
of a no-fly zone.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.037
Tonight
is for Gabriella!

07:50.070 --> 07:52.172
[crowd murmurs]

07:54.041 --> 07:56.176
And you...

07:56.209 --> 07:58.178
let's live it up!

07:58.211 --> 08:00.047
Let's drink it up!

08:00.080 --> 08:01.582
Let's drink it up!

08:01.615 --> 08:02.816
Baila! Baila! Baila!

08:02.850 --> 08:06.587
[cheers and applause]

08:08.689 --> 08:10.257
Hey, when you're done
racking up that OT,

08:10.290 --> 08:11.659
I'm going bowling
at the Piers.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.527
Some friends
from law school.

08:13.561 --> 08:14.862
Law school?

08:14.895 --> 08:16.564
They're not lawyers yet.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.065
Some of them are hot.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.568
Well, they're not hot.
They're pretty.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.235
Uh, rain check.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.671
Suit yourself.

08:23.704 --> 08:24.938
Take it easy.

08:27.575 --> 08:30.077
* I want to see you
feel good to the music *

08:30.110 --> 08:31.278
* Just lose it

08:31.311 --> 08:33.080
* Abuse it

08:33.113 --> 08:35.115
* Get nasty with it,
make your boy really want it *

08:35.148 --> 08:37.785
* And it's possible that
I'ma have to jump up on it *

[rapping in Spanish]

08:40.821 --> 08:48.829
*

09:03.143 --> 09:05.245
Yes, Maria.
Zara's here.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.681
Yeah, she's at the party
with Sonya and my mother.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.650
It's all fine.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.619
Of course
I'm glad to see her.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.621
I just don't like
being sandbagged.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.322
This is my family,
and I'm her father.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.790
[phone beeps]

09:16.824 --> 09:19.259
Wait, hold on, Maria.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.260
Hey, Zara.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.962
Daddy,
come quick!

09:21.995 --> 09:23.831
They're fighting.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.933
All right, just tell me
what's going on.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.735
[Cesaria shouting]

09:27.768 --> 09:29.036
Abuelita!

09:30.671 --> 09:31.972
[object shatters]

09:34.141 --> 09:35.643
Zara!

09:39.780 --> 09:40.981
Zara!

09:43.784 --> 09:45.318
- Daddy!
- Zara.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.954
Daddy,
it was scary.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.756
Are you okay?
¿Que pasó?

09:48.789 --> 09:50.190
One minute
everyone was dancing.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.191
Then all hell broke loose.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.392
Hey, uh...

09:52.425 --> 09:54.194
Excuse me.
This is my mother and daughter.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.129
Can you get them out of here?
Make sure they get home.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.297
- [speaking Spanish]
- Okay.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.099
(man)
Animal!

09:59.132 --> 10:01.869
Nicolas is a pig!

10:01.902 --> 10:03.370
I want to see Gabriella.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.405
- Nick!
- ¿Estás bien?

10:05.438 --> 10:06.874
Oh, God.
Thank God you're here.

10:06.907 --> 10:07.908
But what the hell happened?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.009
Gabriella's over there.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.978
I got to go find Papi.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.913
Excuse me, I'm Nick Amaro,
Manhattan SVU.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.848
The detectives are inside.
Who called SVU?

10:14.882 --> 10:16.149
No, I'm with the family.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.785
Gabriella, I'm
Nicolas' son, Nick.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.319
We're gonna get you
taken care of, all right?

10:19.352 --> 10:22.289
I'm dizzy.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.323
Nicolas,

10:23.356 --> 10:25.325
he was so angry.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.360
He said that I wasn't
showing him respect,

10:27.394 --> 10:29.663
and then he hit me.

10:29.697 --> 10:30.831
[moans]

10:30.864 --> 10:31.899
What?

10:35.903 --> 10:38.405
My father did this
to you?

10:40.407 --> 10:42.676
Esperate.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.377
¿Nicolas es tu papa?

10:44.411 --> 10:46.346
[speaking Spanish]

10:46.379 --> 10:48.716
¿Que pasó?

10:48.749 --> 10:49.917
I don't feel well.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.785
Please just take
me to a hospital.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.087
Yes, ma'am.
Detective, please.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.330
(Nicolas)
You believe this?
After all I've done for him?

11:03.363 --> 11:04.765
Hey, amiga mia,
I don't want to see you

11:04.798 --> 11:06.033
get in any trouble, all right?
- Yep.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.367
My son, Nick--

11:07.400 --> 11:09.036
very important
New York detective.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.203
Right, Nick?

11:10.237 --> 11:11.705
We got to take
you in, sir.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.040
You want to
talk to him?

11:13.073 --> 11:15.075
No, no. Do what you
got to do.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.710
- What are you doing?
- We gotta take you in.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.011
- Come on.
- I said what are you doing?

11:18.045 --> 11:19.112
Okay, you heard
her outcry,

11:19.146 --> 11:20.247
so we need your statement.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.348
Meet us at the hospital.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.449
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.751
(Nicolas)
Hey, Nick!

11:23.784 --> 11:25.719
Are you gonna tell them?

11:25.753 --> 11:26.854
You're my son!

11:26.887 --> 11:29.156
Just--
just do what they say.

11:40.333 --> 11:40.467
.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.168
Liv. Hey, what are
you doing here?

11:42.469 --> 11:43.971
I heard about
the fight.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.305
- Is Zara okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.174
Nicolas was arrested.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.976
His fiancée has
a head injury.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.343
Sergeant Benson.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.444
Thank you for coming.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.813
Can we talk--

11:52.846 --> 11:54.147
in private?

11:54.181 --> 11:55.448
Absolutely.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.017
Look, I'll go call
my mother, check on Zara.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.820
Nick, it's probably
best if you go home.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.789
Go home.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.258
What's going on?

12:05.292 --> 12:07.327
Okay,
so this isn't on us,

12:07.360 --> 12:10.831
but the EMT at the scene,
a real stickler,

12:10.864 --> 12:12.265
overheard the vic
telling your detective

12:12.299 --> 12:14.167
that his father hit her.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.468
Okay, nobody's looking
for special favors here,

12:15.502 --> 12:16.469
believe me.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.470
Just hear us out.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.139
So, we do
our interview,

12:19.172 --> 12:21.208
and the girl, who has
a fractured skull,

12:21.241 --> 12:25.178
tells us a completely
different story.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.346
Changing stories,
cover stories--

12:26.379 --> 12:28.949
we all know what
happens in DV cases.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.918
The problem is the EMT
thinks it happens

12:30.951 --> 12:34.187
after Detective Amaro says
something to her in Spanish.

12:34.221 --> 12:37.424
He thinks Amaro told her
to change her story?

12:37.457 --> 12:40.861
That's not possible.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.395
When I was talking
to the first detective,

12:42.429 --> 12:44.464
I was confused.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.099
When you say first detective,

12:46.133 --> 12:48.101
you mean Nicolas' son,
Detective Amaro?

12:48.135 --> 12:49.469
Yes.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.039
But I was wrong to say
that it was Nicolas' fault.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.306
It wasn't.

12:53.340 --> 12:56.944
Mm-hmm. So can you tell us
how you got hurt?

12:56.977 --> 13:00.981
I was dancing with
one of the guests--

13:01.014 --> 13:04.017
I think his
name was Javier--

13:04.051 --> 13:05.318
and...

13:05.352 --> 13:08.255
he got fresh.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.891
I pushed him away and I
went into the bathroom.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.960
- Downstairs?
- Sí.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.261
Pero...

13:14.294 --> 13:15.996
He followed me.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.131
He pushed me
into the corner

13:18.165 --> 13:20.467
and he touched
my breast.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.937
Okay.
And what happened then?

13:25.505 --> 13:27.274
Nicolas came down,

13:27.307 --> 13:30.010
he tried to pull
Javier away,

13:30.043 --> 13:31.945
and that's when
I hit my head

13:31.979 --> 13:33.280
against a wall.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.315
By accident.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.287
Did anyone hit you?

13:40.320 --> 13:41.889
No.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.060
So your head
just hit the wall?

13:47.094 --> 13:48.261
Yes.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.866
Was anybody else there?

13:52.900 --> 13:54.201
No. It was just
the two of us.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.369
I mean three.

13:58.939 --> 14:02.209
You told Detective Amaro
that Nicolas was angry at you.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.311
He was worried.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.879
If he wouldn't
have come down,

14:05.913 --> 14:08.581
I don't know what
would have happened.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.384
Gabriella, listen to me.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.186
If you're afraid of Nicolas

14:13.220 --> 14:15.655
or afraid that his son
is a cop,

14:15.688 --> 14:17.257
we can keep you safe.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.192
Just let Nicolas go.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.094
He didn't hurt me.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.499
(Amaro)
If my father did something,

14:26.533 --> 14:28.936
I don't want anyone here
risking anything on his behalf.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.237
Yeah, but now
she's claiming

14:30.270 --> 14:32.305
some other guy
sexually assaulted her?

14:32.339 --> 14:33.640
I don't know
anything about that.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.576
In the meantime, Nick,

14:36.609 --> 14:38.145
you're back at the desk.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.246
Oh--

14:42.349 --> 14:44.918
You two get
me a timeline,

14:44.952 --> 14:47.087
witness statements,
cell phone pics,

14:47.120 --> 14:49.089
any video footage
from that party.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.390
[phone chimes]
And this guy
she's accusing?

14:50.423 --> 14:52.125
Javier Arenas.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.326
Ah, look at this.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.995
Up until a year ago,
he was on the registry.

14:55.028 --> 14:55.996
Statutory rape.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.064
Start there.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.402
(Javier)
Statutory rape?

15:02.435 --> 15:04.171
I was 19,
she was 16.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.139
Her father was a cop.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.274
Took me ten years
to clear my name.

15:07.307 --> 15:10.143
And one night
to mess it up.

15:10.177 --> 15:14.714
Gabriella Nuñez claims
you assaulted her.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.483
Come on.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.318
We did some dirty dancing.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.452
I had my hands on her,

15:19.486 --> 15:22.189
but she was backing up that
bus on me pretty good first.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.992
That's it?

15:25.025 --> 15:26.393
I whispered to her
that I could do things

15:26.426 --> 15:28.228
without needing
a blue pill.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.596
She caught Nicolas
looking at her.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.131
She freaked out,
took off.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.599
Downstairs, where
you followed her.

15:32.632 --> 15:33.633
No.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.269
I'm a lover,
not a fighter.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.138
I stayed on the
dance floor--ask anyone.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.307
- And Nicolas' daughter--
- Sonya?

15:40.340 --> 15:41.741
Yeah, whatever.
I danced with her next.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.276
She didn't just
back up the bus.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.078
She parked it.

15:45.112 --> 15:48.081
Better yet,
ask Gabriella's father,

15:48.115 --> 15:49.116
Luis.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.950
He saw the whole thing.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.655
(Luis)
Spartacus is the only one
who keeps me calm now.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.457
After what happened
to Gabriella...

15:57.490 --> 15:59.126
Mr. Nuñez,
did you actually see

15:59.159 --> 16:00.293
what happened
to your daughter?

16:00.327 --> 16:03.230
No, but I know that it was
Nicolas Amaro that hit her.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.464
Piece of garbage.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.632
But if you
didn't see it,

16:05.665 --> 16:06.633
how do you know
it was him?

16:06.666 --> 16:08.201
She was dancing,

16:08.235 --> 16:09.469
having fun.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.204
And then he stares at her.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.572
So she stops dancing,

16:12.605 --> 16:14.741
goes down,
and he followed her.

16:14.774 --> 16:17.410
See anybody else
go downstairs?

16:17.444 --> 16:19.246
Just him.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.548
A few minutes later,
he comes up,

16:21.581 --> 16:24.317
grabs some ice
from a water glass,

16:24.351 --> 16:26.119
and rubs it on his knuckles,

16:26.153 --> 16:27.687
and I run downstairs,

16:27.720 --> 16:30.123
and I see my daughter
all bloody.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.259
That's when you went
after Nicolas?

16:32.292 --> 16:34.361
I want him in jail.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.763
Even if I have to go too.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.170
(Tucker)
Detective Amaro.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.371
If I am talking to you,

16:44.404 --> 16:46.539
it must be time to
pay my water bill.

16:46.573 --> 16:47.807
What are we up to?

16:47.840 --> 16:51.478
Three, four
investigations a year, huh?

16:51.511 --> 16:53.180
I did not pressure
the victim.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.782
Well, the EMT claims you IDed
yourself to the victim

16:55.815 --> 16:58.618
as both NYPD
and her fiancé's son,

16:58.651 --> 17:01.288
and you spoke
to her in Spanish.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.290
I told her
everything was okay

17:03.323 --> 17:04.491
and asked if
I could help.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.259
And just like that,

17:06.293 --> 17:07.794
she decided it wasn't
your father who hit her?

17:07.827 --> 17:09.562
I did not tell her to
back off that story.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.564
Not in Spanish,
not in English.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.301
I believe you.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.571
Just do us all a favor,
will you?

17:18.605 --> 17:20.440
Steer clear.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.242
It can't look
like a cop is

17:22.275 --> 17:24.211
pulling strings
to protect family.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.285
Well, like Ms. Nuñez
told your sergeant,

17:32.319 --> 17:33.420
and everyone else,

17:33.453 --> 17:35.555
this fellow, Javier,
was harassing her.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.657
I heard her scream,
I went downstairs,

17:37.690 --> 17:39.159
I pulled him off her.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.827
And that is
what she said.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.595
Problem is, we can't
find one witness

17:42.629 --> 17:45.465
that saw Javier go downstairs.
- Yeah.

17:45.498 --> 17:49.269
The only person anyone saw
go after Gabriella was you.

17:49.302 --> 17:52.172
(lawyer)
Drunk people in a dark,
chaotic room--

17:52.205 --> 17:53.306
What do they know?

17:53.340 --> 17:54.141
(Fin)
We also have a witness

17:54.174 --> 17:55.842
that saw your
client come upstairs

17:55.875 --> 17:57.177
and put ice on his knuckles.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.178
Yeah, I hit a wall

17:58.211 --> 18:00.147
defending my fiancée.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.182
I mean, he had
it coming to him.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.516
Well, according
to Javier, who--

18:03.550 --> 18:05.252
he didn't have
a mark on him--

18:05.285 --> 18:06.686
Gabriella was twerking,

18:06.719 --> 18:07.887
you got jealous,
you beat her.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.622
All due respect,

18:09.656 --> 18:12.159
no witnesses,
she's not pressing charges--

18:12.192 --> 18:13.293
we're done.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.627
Domestic violence
is a must-arrest.

18:14.661 --> 18:15.795
Yeah, but it's not
a must-charge.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.497
Domestic violence?
This is an accident

18:17.530 --> 18:19.166
that happened the night
before our wedding.

18:19.199 --> 18:22.335
Come on.
I'd never hit a woman.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.704
You know, Cubans
come to this country,

18:24.737 --> 18:25.872
and within one generation,

18:25.905 --> 18:27.574
we're doctors, lawyers,

18:27.607 --> 18:29.209
CEOs of major corporations,

18:29.242 --> 18:30.843
but the only headline you
ever read in the paper

18:30.877 --> 18:32.145
is "Crazy Cubans
in Wedding Brawl."

18:32.179 --> 18:33.480
I hate this.
- Look, none of us

18:33.513 --> 18:35.648
want to be here,
but this guy is guilty.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.484
You seem awfully sure.

18:37.517 --> 18:40.287
Is there anything
else I need to know?

18:40.320 --> 18:41.654
Yeah.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.591
There is.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.229
(Nicolas)
Assault charges, huh?

18:49.262 --> 18:50.730
And $100,000 bail.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.265
[laughs]

18:52.299 --> 18:53.766
You better get me
out of here, kid.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.935
No, I'm not
bailing you out.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.604
[chuckles]

18:57.637 --> 18:59.739
You're that behind
on your alimony, huh?

18:59.772 --> 19:01.774
[snickering]

19:01.808 --> 19:05.245
What you need to do
is take a plea...right?

19:05.278 --> 19:06.846
Don't put everybody
through a trial.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.615
- All right?
- What are you talking about?

19:08.648 --> 19:11.318
I'm not gonna plead guilty
to something I didn't do.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.420
Come on. Stop.
You hit her.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.288
- What are you--
- We both know it.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.224
Gabriella told me herself.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.291
She's mixed up.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.426
She's mixed up?

19:19.459 --> 19:21.228
Hey, you talk to 50
people at a party,

19:21.261 --> 19:22.862
you're gonna get 50
different answers.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.565
Right.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.400
You know, I thought I could
talk some sense into you.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.701
You walking out on me?

19:28.735 --> 19:30.237
Well, you're the expert
on walking out.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.404
I didn't use a belt
enough with you.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.405
Come here!

19:32.439 --> 19:33.606
You want to walk out?

19:33.640 --> 19:35.342
- Yeah.
- Go ahead, walk out!

19:35.375 --> 19:36.643
I brought you into
this world, kid.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.478
You don't walk
out on me.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.946
I'm your father.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.949
Yeah. You don't
dare walk out on me.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.584
Where are
you going?

19:44.617 --> 19:46.353
You want to know
why you hate me?

19:46.386 --> 19:48.255
'Cause I'm your flesh
and blood, Nicky.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.989
Yeah. You're no
different than me.

19:50.022 --> 19:53.293
[buzzer]
In fact, you're
Nicky Amaro, Jr.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.494
You hear me?

20:05.605 --> 20:05.805
.

20:05.838 --> 20:06.706
Sergeant, we gotta
stop meeting like this.

20:07.674 --> 20:10.310
Amaro has no interest
in protecting his father.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.679
He is not trying
to fix this.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.714
All right, so much
for the small talk.

20:14.747 --> 20:15.748
But since you're asking,

20:15.782 --> 20:17.284
I would hate to be him
right now.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.985
He either testifies
against his father,

20:19.018 --> 20:21.288
which is barbaric,
or he looks like

20:21.321 --> 20:23.790
he's conspiring
to cover up a crime.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.525
Almost feel sorry
for him.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.328
Wow. Getting soft
in your old age.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.962
Maybe.

20:31.698 --> 20:34.501
So you gonna just stand
here talking about Amaro

20:34.534 --> 20:36.536
or can I buy you
a drink?

20:39.306 --> 20:41.007
How's the wine here?

20:47.314 --> 20:47.814
You want me
to testify?

20:49.616 --> 20:51.284
But last I heard, you
wanted me to stay away.

20:51.318 --> 20:52.985
I did, pero, tu padre,

20:53.019 --> 20:54.521
who's even more
stubborn than you are,

20:54.554 --> 20:55.922
wouldn't take a plea.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.023
He says his honor's
too important.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.491
Well, that's
not my problem.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.792
Well, look, there were
100 people at that party

20:59.826 --> 21:00.827
and I wasn't one of them.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.495
And none of them
saw the fight.

21:02.529 --> 21:03.663
You're the one
who Gabriella

21:03.696 --> 21:06.065
made her outcry to,
Nick.

21:06.098 --> 21:09.302
You're also the only
one who can testify

21:09.336 --> 21:11.438
that it was part
of a pattern.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.674
You told him about that?

21:14.707 --> 21:16.309
Those were private
conversations.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.310
It was pertinent, Nick.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.412
I had to inform.

21:19.446 --> 21:22.749
Inform is right.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.050
Are you enjoying this?
Huh?

21:24.083 --> 21:25.652
No.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.354
But if your fathers sees
your name on a list,

21:27.387 --> 21:28.355
maybe he'll plea it out.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.089
And what if he doesn't?

21:30.122 --> 21:32.659
I mean, how do explain that
to the rest of my family?

21:38.064 --> 21:40.467
Aunt Sonya says you
want grandpa in jail.

21:45.071 --> 21:46.406
Mi amo, go play on your iPad.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.408
I don't want to
play on my iPad.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.444
- I want to talk.
- Zara.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.480
Okay, okay.
Don't yell.

21:58.751 --> 21:59.986
Please tell me
it's not true.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.088
I can't talk about this.

22:02.121 --> 22:03.723
You know, you could
be called too.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.057
I hope I am.

22:05.091 --> 22:05.992
I'm still in his corner.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.660
He wouldn't hurt Gabriella.

22:07.694 --> 22:10.630
Are you serious?
We all know what happened.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.034
She must have done
something.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.672
So it was her fault?

22:19.706 --> 22:22.041
She deserved it
just like you did?

22:23.075 --> 22:24.911
Your father's not who he was.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.449
All right.

22:29.482 --> 22:32.051
You want to help him?

22:32.084 --> 22:33.753
Tell Nicolas
to plead guilty.

22:33.786 --> 22:36.088
He'll get the community service
and anger management.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.490
Lot of good
that's done you.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.125
- Sonya.
- Mom!

22:39.158 --> 22:41.994
Don't let him do this.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.897
He will destroy the family.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.032
Hey, it's too late.

22:46.065 --> 22:47.967
Hey, Papi already did that.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.639
Talk fast, Mr. D'Angelo.

22:52.672 --> 22:53.973
We're five minutes
from opening statements.

22:54.006 --> 22:55.642
Well, I can't talk as
fast as you, Mr. Barba,

22:55.675 --> 22:57.477
but here goes.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.912
In the interest of sparing his
family any more embarrassment,

22:59.946 --> 23:02.782
my client is willing to plea to
a crime that he did not commit.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.116
You know my office
can't accept a plea

23:04.150 --> 23:06.018
without a genuine
admission of guilt.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.954
Well, you have no
cooperating complainant.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.522
You have no eyewitnesses.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.624
I say we drop this down
to a disorderly conduct,

23:11.658 --> 23:12.659
be done with it.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.126
Dis-con?
He cracked her skull.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.962
Hey, I was defending
my fiancée.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.064
Please. You think some
jury's gonna believe that?

23:18.097 --> 23:20.667
Well, I'll tell you what.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.769
My daughter will testify.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.804
So will my fiancée.

23:24.837 --> 23:27.974
Am I making this up...hmm?

23:28.007 --> 23:29.776
No one saw this.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.143
Are you counting
on my son?

23:31.177 --> 23:33.846
'Cause there's something
you should know.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.048
He's never had the nerve
to go up against his father.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.717
All right?
He still doesn't.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.022
Assault three.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.190
60 days in Rikers.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.494
Nicolas,

23:47.527 --> 23:48.928
you're looking at
serious time here.

23:48.961 --> 23:51.498
Please, for the
sake of your family.

23:51.531 --> 23:54.066
[slam]
I don't take crumbs.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.036
Especially
from this--

23:57.069 --> 23:58.871
this gentleman who
wears suspenders.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.681
(Barba)
Mr. Arenas, you were
initially questioned

24:08.715 --> 24:10.750
by those SVU detectives
as a suspect in this case.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.151
Is that correct?

24:12.184 --> 24:14.654
They said Gabriella had
accused me of assaulting her.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.556
- Why would she say that?
- Objection.

24:16.589 --> 24:17.757
Calls for speculation,
your Honor.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.058
Agreed.

24:19.091 --> 24:22.228
Mr. Barba, you're
off to a flying stop.

24:22.261 --> 24:24.230
You were dancing with
Ms. Nuñez at the party?

24:24.263 --> 24:26.499
We were enjoying
ourselves.

24:26.533 --> 24:28.167
Till Nicolas started
staring at us.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.669
Giving me
the malocchio.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.170
(Barba)
The evil eye.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.171
Then what happened?

24:32.204 --> 24:33.005
Nicolas went
after Gabriella

24:33.039 --> 24:34.006
down the stairs.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.742
Did you follow them?

24:35.775 --> 24:37.677
I may have been tempting
fate by dancing with her,

24:37.710 --> 24:39.812
but even I know you don't get
between a man and his woman.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.213
When was the next
time that you saw

24:41.247 --> 24:43.583
either Ms. Nuñez
or Mr. Amaro?

24:43.616 --> 24:45.952
Nicolas came upstairs
a few minutes later.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.019
Put ice on his hand.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.759
Did you see Ms. Nuñez?

24:52.792 --> 24:54.927
Later, when her mother was
helping her up the stairs.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.663
She was out of it.

24:56.696 --> 24:59.599
By then, the fight
had broken out.

24:59.632 --> 25:02.168
Gabriella's father, Luis,
was protect his daughter.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.203
Objection.
Speculation again.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.638
Agreed.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.540
Jury will disregard.

25:08.941 --> 25:11.277
Nothing further.

25:11.310 --> 25:14.013
Mr. Arenas, uh...

25:14.046 --> 25:17.750
you said you did not
go down the stairs,

25:17.784 --> 25:21.721
so you have absolutely
no idea what transpired?

25:21.754 --> 25:23.690
I know she got
hurt down there.

25:23.723 --> 25:25.992
She?
You mean Gabriella Nuñez?

25:26.025 --> 25:29.261
The woman who accused
you of hurting her?

25:29.295 --> 25:31.664
She blamed me 'cause
she's afraid of Nicolas.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.099
Speculation again,
your Honor.

25:33.132 --> 25:34.967
I mean, this is
a really bad habit.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.870
I will ask the witness to
testify to what he knows

25:37.904 --> 25:39.071
and what he saw.

25:39.105 --> 25:40.640
(D'Angelo)
Good idea.

25:40.673 --> 25:41.674
Now, prior to
this party,

25:41.708 --> 25:43.175
had you ever
met Ms. Nuñez

25:43.209 --> 25:44.110
or Mr. Amaro?

25:44.143 --> 25:46.078
No.
A friend brought me.

25:46.112 --> 25:48.247
So you don't know
anything about the couple,

25:48.280 --> 25:50.216
you didn't see what
happened between them,

25:50.249 --> 25:52.351
and she's accused you
of assaulting her.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.820
Yeah, but I told
you, I didn't do--

25:53.853 --> 25:55.054
Thank you.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.222
No further questions.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.696
(Barba)
How was Mr. Amaro
treating your daughter

26:03.730 --> 26:04.931
on the night in question?

26:04.964 --> 26:06.032
He was yelling at her

26:06.065 --> 26:08.134
for the way that
she was dancing.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.336
She tried to walk away,

26:10.369 --> 26:14.040
and I saw him follow
her downstairs.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.975
He came back up

26:16.008 --> 26:19.278
a couple minutes later...

26:19.311 --> 26:22.048
and he grabbed some ice
and he put it on his knuckles.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.083
- Where was your daughter?
- On the floor downstairs.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.152
He'd hit her

26:26.185 --> 26:28.120
on the night before
her wedding.

26:28.154 --> 26:30.690
Objection. It's a speculation
party, your Honor.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.324
Mr. Barba,
rephrase.

26:32.358 --> 26:35.061
When you found your
daughter on the floor,

26:35.094 --> 26:36.896
bloodied with a head injury,

26:36.929 --> 26:39.632
did you see anyone
else downstairs?

26:39.666 --> 26:41.167
No.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.935
And did you see anyone
else come up the stairs

26:42.969 --> 26:44.170
other than Mr. Amaro?

26:44.203 --> 26:45.171
No.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.939
Just Nicolas.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.174
Only him.

26:48.207 --> 26:49.876
Thank you.
Nothing further.

26:52.712 --> 26:55.081
You never liked
Nicolas Amaro, did you?

26:55.114 --> 26:56.248
A man his age

26:56.282 --> 26:59.051
marrying a girl
my daughter's age?

26:59.085 --> 27:01.053
That's not right.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.922
It's fair to say that you
didn't want the wedding

27:02.955 --> 27:04.791
and you would do anything
you could to derail it?

27:04.824 --> 27:06.392
Anything in my power.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.060
How about lying
on the witness stand?

27:08.094 --> 27:10.129
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.197
Thank you.
I'm done.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.265
Mr. Barba,
your next witness.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.801
Your Honor,
it's late in the day.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.068
If the defense has no objection,

27:16.102 --> 27:17.003
can we reconvene tomorrow?

27:17.036 --> 27:19.038
Let Mr. Barba take
all the time he needs.

27:19.071 --> 27:20.807
We're ready when he is.

27:25.011 --> 27:26.846
(Barba)
Make it a double.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.247
Tough day?

27:28.280 --> 27:30.149
It's a he-said,
she-won't-say.

27:30.182 --> 27:31.851
No one else saw
what happened,

27:31.884 --> 27:33.786
and the jury senses
all my witnesses

27:33.820 --> 27:35.154
have a grudge
against your father.

27:35.187 --> 27:36.188
Thank you.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.256
Do they see why?

27:37.289 --> 27:38.324
I doubt it.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.992
He's sitting at the table,

27:40.026 --> 27:41.027
smiling at the judge,

27:41.060 --> 27:42.695
flirting with the
stenographer,

27:42.729 --> 27:44.163
egging his attorney on.

27:44.196 --> 27:45.431
He's got the whole
room on his side.

27:45.464 --> 27:48.334
Ahh, it's the story
of my life.

27:48.367 --> 27:49.802
He beat my mother,

27:49.836 --> 27:51.370
and she'd testify
for him if he asked.

27:54.373 --> 27:58.177
I'm gonna see if they'll
take a plea for harassment.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.879
What, a misdemeanor?

27:59.912 --> 28:01.180
He fractured her skull.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.215
You and I know that.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.117
But even if you testify,
he could still walk.

28:05.151 --> 28:06.719
But--

28:06.753 --> 28:08.120
What are you telling me?

28:08.154 --> 28:09.989
You don't have to do this.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.357
I should never have
asked you to testify

28:11.390 --> 28:12.925
in open court
against your father.

28:12.959 --> 28:15.027
- Are you playing me now?
- No.

28:15.061 --> 28:18.097
I know what it's like to have
to face down your old man.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.799
Mine's dead 15 years,
and my hand

28:19.832 --> 28:22.001
still curls into a fist
whenever I think of him.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.169
So, what--

28:23.202 --> 28:27.874
He just gets to
walk away again?

28:44.023 --> 28:44.156
.

28:44.190 --> 28:44.924
Okay, Nick,
so just tell the facts.

28:46.458 --> 28:47.860
Don't say more
than you have to.

28:47.894 --> 28:48.961
Don't burn the
house down.

28:48.995 --> 28:50.496
Yeah, Barba said
the same thing.

28:50.529 --> 28:51.998
That's a beautiful
color on you.

28:52.031 --> 28:52.932
Will you stop it?

28:52.965 --> 28:54.934
There he goes.
Saint Nick.

28:54.967 --> 28:57.103
Could you imagine if
he was just a fun cop?

28:57.136 --> 28:59.105
Don't touch her.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.407
Could you tell him what going
up against his father publicly

29:01.440 --> 29:02.842
is gonna do to his family?

29:02.875 --> 29:03.976
- Is this worth it?
- Excuse us.

29:04.010 --> 29:06.913
- Let's go.
- Nick.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.547
You know, you could
just tell the truth.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.917
End this right now.

29:10.950 --> 29:11.984
Okay.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.219
You do what you do,

29:13.252 --> 29:14.987
I'll do what I do.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.823
Okay, Papi.
You're always right.

29:16.856 --> 29:17.924
Yeah.

29:17.957 --> 29:21.093
Took you 40 years
to learn that?

29:21.127 --> 29:23.195
Not everyone throws me
under the bus.

29:31.503 --> 29:33.072
(Amaro)
My eight-year-old daughter

29:33.105 --> 29:34.106
called me from the party,

29:34.140 --> 29:35.507
said there was a fight going on

29:35.541 --> 29:36.976
and she was scared.

29:37.009 --> 29:38.978
What did you find
at the scene?

29:39.011 --> 29:40.446
Mayhem.

29:40.479 --> 29:43.215
Guests were bloody,
under arrest.

29:43.249 --> 29:44.450
My father's fiancée

29:44.483 --> 29:46.485
was being treated by
EMTs for a head injury.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.120
And when you
approached her?

29:51.290 --> 29:53.159
She made a spontaneous outcry

29:53.192 --> 29:54.961
that Nicolas had lost his temper

29:54.994 --> 29:57.830
and hit her.

29:57.864 --> 30:00.032
(Barba)
Did you believe
Ms. Nuñez's statement?

30:00.066 --> 30:01.000
Yes, I did.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.969
Can you tell us why?

30:03.002 --> 30:04.904
- Well, because--
- Your Honor, may I approach?

30:10.509 --> 30:12.478
I know this is
an outcry witness,

30:12.511 --> 30:14.013
but I believe Mr. Barba

30:14.046 --> 30:16.015
is about to try and delve
into family history.

30:16.048 --> 30:18.985
History of a pattern that
is relevant to this case.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.452
We've been over this.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.022
I'm sorry, Mr. D'Angelo,
but he is right,

30:23.055 --> 30:24.456
and I'll have to allow.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.192
But up to a point.

30:35.101 --> 30:38.570
Detective Amaro...

30:38.604 --> 30:41.540
why did you
find her credible?

30:41.573 --> 30:44.243
Because I recognized
what set him off.

30:47.546 --> 30:50.016
Whenever he was jealous

30:50.049 --> 30:55.021
or felt like he'd
been disrespected,

30:55.054 --> 30:56.588
that's when he would

30:56.622 --> 30:59.025
beat my mother.

30:59.058 --> 31:00.960
And me.

31:00.993 --> 31:03.562
And I still...
I still have nightmares

31:03.595 --> 31:05.898
where he uses that
same language.

31:10.136 --> 31:11.938
Thank you.

31:11.971 --> 31:13.439
Nothing further.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.112
Detective Amaro,

31:20.146 --> 31:21.981
I imagine this is
difficult for you,

31:22.014 --> 31:23.950
testifying against
your own father.

31:23.983 --> 31:25.117
Yes, it is.

31:25.151 --> 31:27.119
Now, you two
haven't spoken much

31:27.153 --> 31:30.122
over the past 20
years, have you?

31:30.156 --> 31:32.091
We've seen each other
a few times.

31:32.124 --> 31:35.661
You know, at events,
graduations, funerals, you know.

31:35.694 --> 31:37.629
(D'Angelo)
That's all?

31:37.663 --> 31:41.167
So your relationship
isn't exactly close.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.701
Hmm.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.971
Would you say
there's tension?

31:45.004 --> 31:47.373
Yes.
And with good reason.

31:47.406 --> 31:50.042
(D'Angelo)
Probably many.
But isn't it true

31:50.076 --> 31:52.478
that your father

31:52.511 --> 31:55.047
came to you in the
spirit of reconciliation

31:55.081 --> 31:57.083
and invited you
to his wedding?

31:57.116 --> 31:58.317
[laughs]

31:58.350 --> 31:59.986
Spirit...

32:00.019 --> 32:01.587
You know, he wanted
to create the illusion

32:01.620 --> 32:03.322
that we have
a relationship.

32:03.355 --> 32:04.323
(D'Angelo)
You refused?

32:04.356 --> 32:05.992
(Amaro)
Yes.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.326
(D'Angelo)
Because you're still
angry with him?

32:07.359 --> 32:08.660
Yes, but that's not why--

32:08.694 --> 32:09.595
Detective, would you say

32:09.628 --> 32:12.131
that you have your own
issues with anger?

32:15.134 --> 32:18.971
I'd say everyone
has a temper, Counselor.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.606
Yes, but we haven't all
beaten up a civilian...

32:20.639 --> 32:22.074
- Objection.
- In plain view

32:22.108 --> 32:24.143
of a yard full
of schoolchildren, have we?

32:24.176 --> 32:25.077
(Barba)
Objection.
Prejudicial.

32:25.111 --> 32:28.214
(judge)
Sustained.
Jury will disregard.

32:28.247 --> 32:29.515
(D'Angelo)
Detective,

32:29.548 --> 32:31.050
is it fair to say

32:31.083 --> 32:33.285
that you have anger
at your father

32:33.319 --> 32:36.055
that may prejudice you
against him?

32:38.124 --> 32:39.725
Look, I know what I
heard Gabriella say.

32:39.758 --> 32:42.461
Even though she
immediately denied it?

32:42.494 --> 32:44.663
Is it possible that you
heard what you wanted to hear?

32:44.696 --> 32:46.232
- No.
- That you're using this case

32:46.265 --> 32:48.734
against your father?
- No, I'm not.

32:48.767 --> 32:50.069
You think I want
to be here?

32:50.102 --> 32:51.170
I don't want to be here.

32:51.203 --> 32:53.672
I--but he hit her.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.507
He smashed her head
against the wall.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.776
Oh.
So you saw it?

32:57.809 --> 32:59.278
You were there?

32:59.311 --> 33:01.013
No. I wasn't there.

33:01.047 --> 33:02.048
But I know what happened.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.016
- Do you?
- Yes.

33:04.050 --> 33:06.652
Maybe this is just another
nightmare from your childhood.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.020
(Barba)
Objection.

33:08.054 --> 33:09.788
(D'Angelo)
Withdrawn.

33:22.634 --> 33:23.102
.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.002
Mommy says Aunt Sonya's
really mad at you.

33:25.737 --> 33:28.440
And Grandma, too.

33:28.474 --> 33:30.509
Well, sometimes, you have
to do things that are right

33:30.542 --> 33:32.544
but still make people mad.

33:32.578 --> 33:33.745
Okay, Daddy.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.381
- Don't look sad.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.451
I made this today.

33:39.485 --> 33:41.120
Do you want me
to make you one?

33:41.153 --> 33:42.788
[chuckles]

33:42.821 --> 33:45.191
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like that.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.829
You better go
do your homework, okay?

33:50.862 --> 33:52.398
I love you, Zara.

33:52.431 --> 33:53.765
I love you too, Daddy.

34:07.879 --> 34:08.814
(D'Angelo)
Were you upset with her?

34:08.847 --> 34:09.815
I wasn't upset.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.817
Not with Gabriella, no.

34:11.850 --> 34:14.653
I was upset
with this lowlife,

34:14.686 --> 34:15.821
you know?

34:15.854 --> 34:17.756
Kept putting his
hands all over her, okay?

34:17.789 --> 34:18.757
And did you confront him?

34:18.790 --> 34:20.226
Yes.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.460
He followed her down
to the bathroom.

34:21.493 --> 34:22.594
He started groping
her, you know?

34:22.628 --> 34:23.695
I mean everywhere.

34:23.729 --> 34:24.796
Gabriella got
between us,

34:24.830 --> 34:26.565
but, you know,
she hit her head

34:26.598 --> 34:27.866
against the side of
the wall.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.568
So you did
not hit her?

34:29.601 --> 34:31.837
No, as God
is my witness. Come on.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.772
I'm supposed to marry
her the next day.

34:33.805 --> 34:36.575
But that's okay.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.277
We're good.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.279
Gonna be married soon enough.

34:40.312 --> 34:42.181
And we heard from Mr. Nuñez,
the father of the bride,

34:42.214 --> 34:44.416
testify that he saw
you come upstairs

34:44.450 --> 34:45.751
rubbing ice on your knuckles.

34:45.784 --> 34:46.785
Why was that?

34:46.818 --> 34:47.786
It's true.

34:47.819 --> 34:48.754
I was defending my fiancée.

34:48.787 --> 34:50.189
That's his daughter.

34:50.222 --> 34:51.590
Of course Luis saw me,

34:51.623 --> 34:53.425
but, you know, Luis
has this idea about me.

34:53.459 --> 34:54.693
I don't know.

34:54.726 --> 34:55.861
He's never liked
me to begin with.

34:55.894 --> 34:57.363
I don't know why.

34:57.396 --> 34:58.630
And is your fiancée
in the courtroom today?

34:58.664 --> 35:00.299
Yeah. She's right here.

35:00.332 --> 35:01.767
Looking so beautiful.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.804
I'm blessed.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.774
She refused to testify
for this D.A., you know.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.443
- Your Honor.
- Move it along, Mr. D'Angelo.

35:11.477 --> 35:14.380
And we heard your son testify
about your past violence.

35:14.413 --> 35:15.814
- Is there any basis?
- No.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.449
But that's painful
between us,

35:17.483 --> 35:18.750
because Nicky's--

35:18.784 --> 35:21.187
he's never forgiven me
for leaving his mother.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.455
And...

35:23.489 --> 35:25.924
I live in hope--

35:25.957 --> 35:28.327
hope one day we'll make peace

35:28.360 --> 35:29.495
with that.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.231
Thank you.

35:32.264 --> 35:33.732
Nothing further.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.434
Okay.
Señor Amaro,

35:35.467 --> 35:37.803
it is your testimony

35:37.836 --> 35:40.439
that you were not jealous

35:40.472 --> 35:42.608
when your fiancée was
dancing with Mr. Arenas?

35:42.641 --> 35:44.343
I didn't like it.

35:44.376 --> 35:46.645
You claimed to be defending
her from this man.

35:46.678 --> 35:47.846
Why?
Why would that be necessary

35:47.879 --> 35:49.848
if he never
even went downstairs?

35:49.881 --> 35:51.583
You know how quickly
this occurred, sir?

35:51.617 --> 35:53.719
We've heard six witness
testify to the fact,

35:53.752 --> 35:56.855
so maybe it didn't happen
as quickly as you thought.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.557
You suffered an injured hand,

35:58.590 --> 36:01.427
but Mr. Arenas had absolutely
no marks on him of any kind.

36:03.895 --> 36:05.197
Well, he's a coward.
He ducked.

36:05.231 --> 36:06.265
- He ducked?
- He ducked.

36:06.298 --> 36:09.335
He ducked, so your fiancée
incurred a bruised face,

36:09.368 --> 36:10.702
a fractured skull.

36:10.736 --> 36:11.803
- You said it yourself, sir.
- What?

36:11.837 --> 36:12.938
I was defending my fiancée.

36:12.971 --> 36:16.875
Your own son testified
to Ms. Nuñez's initial outcry

36:16.908 --> 36:18.577
that you, in fact,
had hit her.

36:18.610 --> 36:19.778
Are you calling
him a liar?

36:19.811 --> 36:21.580
No.

36:21.613 --> 36:23.315
I'm not gonna
call him a liar.

36:23.349 --> 36:25.584
He's my son.

36:25.617 --> 36:26.918
He has his issues.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.887
(Barba)
I'm sure that he
appreciates your concern.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.689
But is he telling the truth?
Is he telling the truth

36:30.722 --> 36:32.558
about what Ms. Nuñez
said that night,

36:32.591 --> 36:33.825
is he telling the truth

36:33.859 --> 36:34.960
about what happened
in your own home--

36:34.993 --> 36:36.295
What do you know
about my home?

36:36.328 --> 36:37.496
I wasn't there.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.830
You're not answering
the question.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.366
- I should have been.
- Your Honor.

36:40.399 --> 36:41.733
I could have shown him
how to conduct himself.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.335
You know?
Maybe as a man.

36:43.369 --> 36:44.936
I'm gonna ask you again.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.672
Mr. Amado,

36:46.705 --> 36:50.276
did you hit
Gabriella Nuñez that night?

36:55.681 --> 36:56.615
No, I did not.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.418
So even though
absolutely nobody--nobody--

36:59.451 --> 37:01.520
saw Mr. Arenas
go downstairs

37:01.553 --> 37:03.755
or come back up,

37:03.789 --> 37:05.324
you are still denying

37:05.357 --> 37:07.759
that you alone hurt Ms. Nuñez?

37:10.929 --> 37:12.664
I would never hurt her.

37:26.878 --> 37:29.548
Nothing further.

37:29.581 --> 37:30.882
(judge)
Mr. Amaro,

37:30.916 --> 37:32.384
you may step down.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.857
The defense rests,
your Honor.

37:38.890 --> 37:41.593
(judge)
We will proceed with summations.

37:43.795 --> 37:44.763
You okay?

37:44.796 --> 37:45.797
I shouldn't have come.

37:45.831 --> 37:47.966
He used me to play the jury.
- You and me both.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.901
He flat-out lied
on the stand.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.337
I knew he would.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.539
I've known guys like
this my whole life.

37:53.572 --> 37:54.906
I went straight at him,
he slipped every punch.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.608
I don't know what
happened up there.

37:56.642 --> 37:57.909
[phone chimes]
Oh, I do.

38:03.649 --> 38:04.850
What's up?

38:04.883 --> 38:06.017
Jury's back.

38:06.051 --> 38:07.686
In 20 minutes?

38:11.857 --> 38:14.526
(woman)
On the charge of assault
in the second degree,

38:14.560 --> 38:17.763
we find the defendant
not guilty.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.765
On the charge of
reckless endangerment

38:19.798 --> 38:21.767
in the second degree,

38:21.800 --> 38:24.503
we find the defendant
not guilty.

38:24.536 --> 38:25.937
(judge)
Members of the jury,

38:25.971 --> 38:27.906
the State of New York
thanks you for your service.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.841
You are dismissed.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.977
Mr. Amaro,
if there are no holds,

38:32.010 --> 38:33.779
you're free to go.
[taps gavel]

38:33.812 --> 38:35.046
Thank you.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.783
[courtroom murmurs]

38:54.666 --> 38:56.101
That was a lousy case.

38:56.134 --> 38:58.069
Justice was swift and wrong.

38:58.103 --> 38:59.605
It's over.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.742
Good night, Nick.

39:03.775 --> 39:04.943
Night.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.817
You want
a few days off?

39:11.850 --> 39:12.784
Nah.

39:12.818 --> 39:15.421
[footsteps]

39:15.454 --> 39:17.423
Mr. Amaro.

39:17.456 --> 39:18.924
Let me have a word
with my son.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.125
I don't think that's
a great idea.

39:20.158 --> 39:22.060
No, Liv,
it's okay.

39:22.093 --> 39:23.862
Nick.

39:23.895 --> 39:24.830
It's fine.

39:33.505 --> 39:34.906
May I sit?

39:39.611 --> 39:40.746
You here to gloat?

39:40.779 --> 39:42.748
No.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.783
I meant what I
said on that stand.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.452
You were just
trying to get off.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.119
Well, I'm free now.

39:48.153 --> 39:49.688
And I'm here.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.696
That was something.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.765
Finally...

39:59.798 --> 40:03.101
you stood up to
your old man.

40:03.134 --> 40:05.637
And you protected Gabriella,
your mother, and your sister,

40:05.671 --> 40:07.439
all in one shot, too.

40:07.473 --> 40:08.740
That was good.

40:10.676 --> 40:11.977
Yeah, and they hate me
for it.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.912
Ah, they'll get over it.
You know?

40:13.945 --> 40:17.182
Hell, I'm the big,
bad Wolf, right?

40:17.215 --> 40:18.884
I had to say what I said
on that stand, Nicky,

40:18.917 --> 40:21.453
'cause--I don't know.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.091
I'm too old...

40:29.060 --> 40:31.162
too old for jail.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.169
I put you in
a horrible position.

40:43.909 --> 40:45.544
Can we start fresh?

40:49.014 --> 40:50.582
I mean, even Gabriella,
God bless her,

40:50.616 --> 40:51.883
I mean,
she's forgiven me.

40:51.917 --> 40:54.019
I mean, that's not
gonna happen again.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.521
You're still lying.

40:55.554 --> 40:56.555
I mean, to me,
to yourself.

40:56.588 --> 40:57.589
Nicky, I get it.
I get it.

40:57.623 --> 40:58.957
Come on.
You're angry.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.125
You stay angry.

41:00.158 --> 41:01.527
As long as you want.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.194
Nicky, I'm just--
I'm here

41:03.228 --> 41:04.830
'cause I'm your
father, all right?

41:04.863 --> 41:06.565
You want to yell,

41:06.598 --> 41:07.833
just don't take it out
on Maria or Sonya,

41:07.866 --> 41:08.834
or, God forbid, little Zara.

41:08.867 --> 41:10.569
I would never.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.003
I would never lay
a hand on her.

41:12.037 --> 41:13.004
I am not you.

41:13.038 --> 41:15.173
Can we stop?
Can we stop?

41:15.206 --> 41:16.975
- Stop.
- Can we talk?

41:17.008 --> 41:18.944
Just talk.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.211
Just talk to me.

41:20.245 --> 41:21.647
You know?

41:21.680 --> 41:22.814
Just call me at
4:00 in the morning,

41:22.848 --> 41:23.615
tell me I ruined your life.

41:23.649 --> 41:25.617
Say whatever you
got to say, Nicky.

41:25.651 --> 41:27.052
'Cause this hatred that
you have for me, Nicky--

41:27.085 --> 41:28.620
come on, it sits in your
chest, it's in your gut--

41:28.654 --> 41:29.621
It's not going away,
you know?

41:29.655 --> 41:30.622
I lived this.

41:30.656 --> 41:31.790
I lived it!

41:31.823 --> 41:33.792
Do you get it?

41:33.825 --> 41:36.261
I'm not the one to fix it.
You got to fix it.

41:38.129 --> 41:39.998
I can't change the past.

41:44.970 --> 41:48.273
If you want to talk,

41:48.306 --> 41:50.208
I want to listen.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.748
When you're ready.
