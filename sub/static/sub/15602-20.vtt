00:32.348 --> 00:35.002
- Aahh!
- Aya!

00:35.039 --> 00:36.742
[screaming]

00:37.815 --> 00:41.083
Season 1, Episode 20:
<b>"Cold Fury"</b>

00:41.847 --> 00:44.968
Manhunters are matching our speed,
Anti-Monitor a little behind him.

00:44.969 --> 00:47.557
We're going to need to arc up
the ultra warp drives to lose 'em.

00:47.558 --> 00:50.962
So do it already! Head of State here,
precious cargo.

00:50.963 --> 00:52.535
Quiet, Zox.

00:53.729 --> 00:55.997
Now that we're all here,
we leave.

00:56.010 --> 00:57.832
Razer, where's Aya?

00:59.035 --> 01:02.815
- She's gone.
- What do you mean, "Aya's gone"?

01:03.108 --> 01:05.513
I mean, she's gone.

01:05.822 --> 01:09.337
- Where is she?
- She's dead!

01:09.362 --> 01:12.810
She came out of the ship to rescue
me and that thing killed her!

01:14.170 --> 01:16.505
You mean
"her body's gone"?

01:16.573 --> 01:19.447
Right. She probably
downloaded back into the ship.

01:19.462 --> 01:21.133
Aya? Aya!

01:21.168 --> 01:23.970
It was too far to do that.

01:24.893 --> 01:26.566
She's dead.

01:27.422 --> 01:32.395
- She was just a kid.
- What were you doing so far away?

01:32.428 --> 01:34.003
I ordered you back to the ship!

01:34.004 --> 01:36.405
You think this is my fault?
Then say that!

01:36.429 --> 01:39.089
Don't mince words.
Say that! One time!

01:39.090 --> 01:42.235
Stop! We have
no time for this.

01:42.237 --> 01:44.145
Though you cannot see it
at this moment,

01:44.146 --> 01:47.273
the A.I.'s death is not
an entirely negative event.

01:47.296 --> 01:50.770
[grunts] What she means is,
we can mourn Aya later.

01:50.786 --> 01:53.615
Razer. I'm talkin'.
Look here!

01:53.682 --> 01:56.051
I need you to run diagnostics
in the engine room.

01:56.118 --> 01:58.920
I need that now.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.793
You should watch your wording.

02:06.860 --> 02:10.517
I must inform the Council
of what has transpired.

02:11.498 --> 02:14.535
I need to make a call, too.

02:17.060 --> 02:18.821
I never saw this coming.

02:18.824 --> 02:21.838
I wish I could tell you to take
a day off to clear your head,

02:21.849 --> 02:23.964
but we need you right now.

02:24.044 --> 02:26.230
Aya isn't the first
crew member we've lost,

02:26.246 --> 02:29.281
<i>and you can be darn sure
she won't be the last.</i>

02:29.784 --> 02:32.711
Then let's make sure
it wasn't for nothing.

02:33.018 --> 02:35.481
<i>Manhunters, as far
as the eye can see.</i>

02:35.482 --> 02:37.588
The green lunkheads
don't know what they're doing,

02:37.589 --> 02:40.458
and that creepy blue troll kid
just sits idly by

02:40.459 --> 02:42.726
as I'm forced to endure
Jordan's recklessness?!

02:42.730 --> 02:43.938
Unacceptable!

02:43.939 --> 02:46.581
What will you have me do,
Prime Magistrate?

02:47.442 --> 02:49.911
Send in the big guns.

02:52.728 --> 02:54.081
We have a problem.

02:54.082 --> 02:57.083
The bad guys have managed to speed up.
They're gaining on us!

02:57.108 --> 02:58.781
So without Aya
and the ultra warp...

02:58.787 --> 03:01.076
We get caught by the tail
in less than an hour.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.138
What course of action
do you propose?

03:03.169 --> 03:06.056
You said Krona banished the
Anti-Monitor to another dimension.

03:06.069 --> 03:07.429
Can you do that?

03:07.430 --> 03:11.267
Krona had access to powers and abilities
we Guardians no longer possess.

03:11.284 --> 03:14.734
We've got to think of something.
Is there any other way?

03:15.261 --> 03:16.987
Stop the ship.

03:18.297 --> 03:20.448
Is there more to your plan?

03:20.482 --> 03:23.227
She's gone space simple.
Just eject her out the air lock.

03:23.250 --> 03:25.748
Green Lantern Jordan,
you will accompany me.

03:25.767 --> 03:28.301
The rest of you,
stay here.

03:43.024 --> 03:44.519
Anytime...!

03:44.540 --> 03:48.245
You can begin your wise
and effective plan anytime now.

03:49.054 --> 03:50.388
Stop!

03:50.447 --> 03:55.409
Negative. Your programming supersedes
obedience to the Guardians.

03:55.447 --> 03:57.428
I am of those who created you.

03:57.463 --> 04:00.965
The Manhunters will obey
the Guardians.

04:06.932 --> 04:08.799
What the nudge was that?!

04:11.113 --> 04:15.136
What happened to "powers and abilities
we Guardians no longer possess"?

04:15.154 --> 04:17.925
The Guardians once
possessed incredible power.

04:17.952 --> 04:20.890
But we locked it away
after establishing the Core.

04:20.911 --> 04:25.856
<i>It has taken time to re-tap these
abilities so foolishly cast aside.</i>

04:25.906 --> 04:27.574
Thousands of years.

04:27.579 --> 04:30.637
But slowly, I master them again.

04:30.668 --> 04:34.168
It would not matter if
you had a thousand millenia.

04:34.235 --> 04:37.671
The Manhunters serve me now.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.981
Time has passed
your kind by, Guardian.

04:42.377 --> 04:44.745
Your creator was Krona.

04:44.789 --> 04:47.704
He was a Guardian, as am I.

04:47.710 --> 04:49.381
Obey me!

04:55.253 --> 04:58.040
<i>I was there
when you were nothing.</i>

04:58.064 --> 05:02.272
And I can turn you back into the
nothingness from which you came!

05:02.397 --> 05:08.269
The Guardian race will be buried
soon enough, but you die now.

05:17.878 --> 05:20.080
[screaming]

05:34.830 --> 05:36.386
I can't move.

05:36.769 --> 05:40.376
Witness as I cast out
your friends.

05:44.105 --> 05:46.980
[all groaning]
No!

05:54.450 --> 05:56.472
We're loose. But how?

05:56.476 --> 06:00.479
The reinforcements that
I demanded have finally arrived.

06:05.290 --> 06:07.963
Keep firing
at that monstrosity!

06:14.194 --> 06:16.295
Fire <i>the Liberators!</i>

06:22.543 --> 06:25.272
Your pitiful efforts
are nothing to me.

06:25.303 --> 06:29.186
Behold the definition
of true power.

07:03.398 --> 07:04.961
No...

07:12.536 --> 07:17.451
- Zox, order your men to evacuate.
- And abandon Shard? Never!

07:17.496 --> 07:21.099
In a few minutes, there's
not going to be a Shard!

07:22.048 --> 07:24.716
<i>All Red Lanterns,
to escape vehicles!</i>

07:24.730 --> 07:28.133
<i>Repeat... all Red Lanterns,
run away!</i>

07:35.684 --> 07:37.968
It's going to take a while
to break down that fortress.

07:37.977 --> 07:40.172
We should use that time
to get out of here.

07:52.992 --> 07:56.885
This is all your fault!
We were humiliated out there!

07:56.906 --> 08:00.483
Nothing can stop that thing.
We're doomed!

08:00.484 --> 08:03.119
Enough! Kilowog,
take the controls.

08:03.120 --> 08:05.890
Push the ship as fast as she'll go,
given the circumstances.

08:05.922 --> 08:08.223
- Right. I'm on it.
- And you...

08:08.251 --> 08:10.719
You need to contact Ysmault,
Prime Magistrate.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.771
Tell them to warm up
everything they got,

08:12.779 --> 08:16.585
because once the Anti-Monitor is done
with Shard, it's coming for them.

08:16.628 --> 08:21.265
<i>Your people are counting on you, Zox,
and there is not a lot of time.</i>

08:29.971 --> 08:34.363
Do you share my opinion that the sweet
embrace of death would be welcome today?

08:34.404 --> 08:36.405
No, I do not.

08:36.472 --> 08:39.075
After Ilana was killed,
I had nothing left.

08:39.236 --> 08:41.491
I lost the will to go on.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.321
But you survived.

08:43.647 --> 08:47.383
I knew if I just gave up,
Ilana would disapprove.

08:47.505 --> 08:50.007
Well, Aya wouldn't
approve, either.

08:50.019 --> 08:52.888
Or she'd at least tell you
why your logic was faulty.

08:53.394 --> 08:55.729
In fact...
[boom]

08:56.219 --> 08:59.604
What in the name of <i>Framad's
turquoise exit vent</i> was that?

08:59.716 --> 09:02.744
Whatever it is,
it's heading for the lower ramp.

09:30.483 --> 09:31.683
Aya?

09:31.804 --> 09:34.980
You're alive!
I... I can't believe it!

09:35.405 --> 09:37.139
Thank you, Green Lantern Hal.

09:37.152 --> 09:40.454
I am also pleased
to see you again. All of you.

09:40.968 --> 09:42.855
Impossible...

09:42.891 --> 09:46.993
You look a little different.
What happened?

09:47.013 --> 09:49.465
When I was critically damaged,
I was too far away

09:49.466 --> 09:51.943
to upload into the Interceptor's
computer banks.

09:51.979 --> 09:55.482
I managed to transfer into
a disabled Manhunter's CPU.

09:55.502 --> 09:57.036
I could not communicate,
however.

09:57.081 --> 09:59.983
So I followed the ship as best
I could until I caught up.

10:00.161 --> 10:02.964
I can't believe it.
You're all right!

10:03.043 --> 10:05.224
Don't scare us
like that again.

10:05.255 --> 10:08.001
I will endeavor not to,
Green Lantern Hal.

10:08.013 --> 10:11.854
Aya, we've got the Manhunters and
the Anti-Monitor headed toward Ysmault.

10:11.855 --> 10:15.469
We need to get ahead of them and
coordinate with their planetary defenses.

10:15.485 --> 10:18.128
- Can you help?
- It should not be a problem.

10:18.155 --> 10:21.397
But it would be helpful if Red Lantern
Razer would assist me.

10:22.382 --> 10:24.483
Of course.

10:32.892 --> 10:36.617
The Manhunters must have ruptured
the flow valves to the impellers.

10:36.625 --> 10:38.248
Can you repair them?

10:38.510 --> 10:41.783
<i>Directing energy
to affected systems. Rebuilding.</i>

10:41.798 --> 10:43.500
The damage is considerable.

10:44.169 --> 10:45.984
I see that.

10:46.485 --> 10:49.666
When I last saw you,
you said you loved me.

10:49.701 --> 10:51.784
I... Did.

10:51.805 --> 10:53.872
Is my appearance
disconcerting?

10:53.908 --> 10:56.343
I believe I can
rectify that problem.

10:59.110 --> 11:01.528
Since my unfortunate meeting
with Atrocitus,

11:01.550 --> 11:04.594
I've created a supply
of spare parts for myself.

11:06.264 --> 11:10.314
[electricity flowing]

11:11.106 --> 11:13.903
There.
This is better, correct?

11:14.534 --> 11:16.235
I...

11:16.257 --> 11:18.994
In my studies of emotion,
it seems a great deal

11:19.038 --> 11:22.741
of what is called "love"
is predicated on how one looks.

11:22.809 --> 11:26.597
That is... Incorrect.
Sometimes.

11:26.629 --> 11:29.764
True love... Is different.

11:30.012 --> 11:34.048
I am unsure how to process this.
I require more information.

11:34.078 --> 11:39.447
What type of love do you have for me,
<i>true love</i>, or some other love?

11:41.887 --> 11:45.126
I do not love you, at all.

11:45.483 --> 11:46.930
I cannot.

11:46.966 --> 11:51.645
That is not consistent with your
actions and what you stated recently.

11:51.899 --> 11:53.599
I...

11:53.621 --> 11:57.146
I believe I was confused
because of the form you've taken.

11:57.367 --> 12:02.271
I thought... believed...
that I was feeling... Love.

12:02.589 --> 12:08.094
But if I do, it's not for you.
It's for the memory of my dear Ilana.

12:08.106 --> 12:11.709
You may have built yourself
in her image, but you are not her.

12:11.730 --> 12:16.767
You are just a machine.
And I can never love you.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.744
I am so sorry.

12:22.542 --> 12:28.107
Processing... Processing...

12:28.143 --> 12:29.460
Processing...

12:39.629 --> 12:42.991
Zox, your flagship is waiting
at the coordinates you asked.

12:42.992 --> 12:46.398
Rally your troops and we'll stop
the Anti-Monitor in its tracks.

12:46.649 --> 12:50.953
Well, don't think it hasn't been a little
slice of heaven, because it hasn't.

12:54.974 --> 12:58.232
<i>Brots</i> be with you
in the coming battle.

13:01.677 --> 13:04.112
Razer does not love me.

13:04.180 --> 13:07.148
Wh-what? Oh.

13:09.321 --> 13:12.597
Razer confessed his love
before I was severely damaged.

13:12.621 --> 13:16.123
But now that I've returned,
he says he does not love me.

13:16.191 --> 13:18.379
Oh, boy.

13:18.395 --> 13:20.327
Thoughts of Razer
and his lack of love for me

13:20.344 --> 13:22.629
are taking up much
of my computing power.

13:22.697 --> 13:24.231
Something is wrong.

13:24.299 --> 13:27.602
I am not operating within
my normal parameters.

13:27.695 --> 13:30.037
That happens.
When I think about the times

13:30.105 --> 13:32.807
I've messed up with Carol
and the times I've hurt her...

13:32.828 --> 13:37.165
- But why did you hurt her?
- I didn't mean to. I never do.

13:37.188 --> 13:41.110
- And Razer didn't mean to hurt you.
- But he is the cause.

13:41.134 --> 13:44.240
The moment replays in my memory
banks on an endless loop.

13:44.295 --> 13:47.488
I believe it is causing me
what you would call "pain".

13:47.556 --> 13:49.791
I do not want to feel this.

13:49.858 --> 13:51.692
Buckle up, Jordan,
here they come.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.871
Aya, I promise we'll talk about
this all you want afterwards.

13:54.886 --> 13:56.988
Right now,
we have a job to do.

13:57.019 --> 13:59.751
But right now I cannot perform
to the best of my abilities.

13:59.767 --> 14:03.337
When will my pain end,
Green Lantern Hal? When?

14:03.405 --> 14:05.410
Sometimes it doesn't,
but that's the chance

14:05.441 --> 14:07.908
we all take when we choose
to care about someone.

14:07.976 --> 14:10.189
It's a part of growing up, Aya.

14:10.732 --> 14:14.924
- Power regulators set at max levels.
- In position for area denial fire.

14:14.948 --> 14:17.416
I promise we'll talk after.

14:17.953 --> 14:22.791
Failing's ghost targeting system engaged.
Let's set that to Manhunter.

14:31.577 --> 14:33.070
Stand ready.

14:33.465 --> 14:35.098
Here they come.

15:09.538 --> 15:12.006
Fire at will. Fire at will!

15:22.568 --> 15:23.896
Razer...

15:23.898 --> 15:27.045
Aya, we have much to speak of,
but now is not a good time.

15:27.046 --> 15:29.381
No, it is not.
What would you do

15:29.382 --> 15:31.848
if emotions were interfering
with your performance?

15:31.872 --> 15:37.043
Simple. I only think of the job at hand.
I shut down everything else.

15:37.392 --> 15:40.615
"Shut down everything else."

15:43.440 --> 15:47.636
[muffled yelling]

15:52.369 --> 15:55.522
Aya! What's the matter?
Get back to your station!

15:59.734 --> 16:02.803
That will not enable us
to survive this encounter.

16:03.010 --> 16:05.879
I know what must be done.

16:09.709 --> 16:13.639
What is that supposed to mean?
Aya, where are you going?!

16:56.806 --> 16:58.157
Now what?!

17:04.279 --> 17:05.913
Aya! What are you doing?

17:06.340 --> 17:09.376
You cannot comprehend
what I am doing.

17:11.732 --> 17:14.935
I am now operating
at super-peak capacity,

17:14.961 --> 17:18.762
as I have discontinued
all non-essential functions.

17:18.815 --> 17:24.284
- Define "non-essential functions."
- I have shut down all emotion.

17:24.351 --> 17:28.154
Don't worry. I will accomplish
our primary objective.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.881
I will destroy
the Anti-Monitor.

17:33.452 --> 17:35.370
Aya, wait!

17:45.682 --> 17:47.183
What happened?

17:47.195 --> 17:49.321
Aya happened.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.028
That's not Aya.

18:18.048 --> 18:20.683
Razer's right. She doesn't
know what she's doing.

18:20.703 --> 18:24.747
Aya, stand down!
The Red Lanterns are on our side!

18:35.547 --> 18:38.349
I think she knows
what she's doing, Jordan,

18:38.384 --> 18:40.637
<i>But doesn't care.</i>

19:14.888 --> 19:16.289
She did it.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.818
She actually did it.

19:18.919 --> 19:21.145
Aya, are you all right?

19:50.815 --> 19:53.939
What are you doing?
It's not safe.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.689
I do not see why
you would be concerned

19:57.721 --> 20:00.187
about the safety
of a mere machine, Razer.

20:00.219 --> 20:02.854
Please, Aya,
come back here with us.

20:02.875 --> 20:06.345
Do you think that I am a robot slave
to be ordered about by you?

20:06.374 --> 20:09.844
That's not what he's saying.
You don't seem well.

20:09.849 --> 20:13.919
- As if you care about my kind.
- You're talkin' crazy, Aya.

20:13.947 --> 20:15.882
You just saved everyone.
We're thankful.

20:15.887 --> 20:18.880
Now, let's destroy the rest of
these Manhunters and get out of here!

20:18.904 --> 20:23.060
You will not harm them. They are foolish
children doing as they were told.

20:23.127 --> 20:28.301
They are not to blame. They function
without emotion, as I do now.

20:28.363 --> 20:32.723
I shall be their Queen.
I will decide what becomes of them.

20:46.353 --> 20:48.933
Calm down, Aya.
Something's wrong with you.

20:48.950 --> 20:54.167
Incorrect. For the first time,
everything is working properly.

20:54.268 --> 20:59.113
<i>But you, all of you, are flawed,
driven by your emotions.</i>

20:59.160 --> 21:01.820
<i>You cause only pain
and suffering.</i>

21:01.923 --> 21:04.392
I reject you and your kind.

21:04.505 --> 21:06.772
I reject you all.

21:22.918 --> 21:25.918
