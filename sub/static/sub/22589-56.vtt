<i>NARRATOR". When last we saw
the Caped Crusaders...</i>

00:12.805 --> 00:15.308
<i>...they were trapped in Black Widow's
giant cobweb...</i>

00:15.517 --> 00:18.770
<i>...about to be bitten
by two deadly Black Widow spiders.</i>

00:18.978 --> 00:22.649
<i>Are the heroes headed for that great
Batcave in the sky?</i>

00:22.857 --> 00:25.360
<i>In scant seconds,
the answer will be yours.</i>

01:34.804 --> 01:36.681
Batman, he's almost on me.

01:37.473 --> 01:41.603
He is a she, Robin.
Only the female of the species is venomous.

01:41.811 --> 01:43.646
And mine is almost upon me also.

01:49.694 --> 01:51.738
I've freed my right hand.

01:51.946 --> 01:55.700
Now if I can just reach the mini charge
in my utility belt.

01:59.621 --> 02:00.872
I've got it.

02:01.456 --> 02:05.793
Brace yourself for a shock of 5000 volts, Robin.
We'll be stunned for a split second.

02:06.586 --> 02:11.966
But the cobweb will act as a conductor,
and the spiders will be electrocuted.

02:12.175 --> 02:15.803
- Hurry, Batman. She's ready to bite me.
-Now.

02:22.101 --> 02:25.355
Good going, Batman.
I thought we were dead ducks.

02:25.563 --> 02:28.983
I'm sure Black Widow thinks
we're dead bats about now.

02:29.192 --> 02:30.693
What was that exit line of hers?

02:30.902 --> 02:35.156
Something about "My lieutenants and I
are going to tunnel into my vault."

02:35.365 --> 02:38.910
Tunnel, that's how most crooks
get into vaults.

02:40.495 --> 02:42.330
But into her own vault?

02:42.538 --> 02:46.751
And she couldn't have gotten far.
She's left the Black Widow Cycle here.

02:50.088 --> 02:51.839
This must be it.

02:52.048 --> 02:54.384
And two for me.

02:54.592 --> 02:58.221
Two for you. And two for me.

02:58.429 --> 03:00.014
Two for you.

03:00.181 --> 03:03.476
I wouldn't grow too attached to all of that
if I were you, Black Widow.

03:03.685 --> 03:06.312
For heaven's sake, look who's here.

03:06.896 --> 03:11.901
You didn't count on us, did you,
you sophisticated but evil woman?

03:12.110 --> 03:13.945
As a matter of fact, no.

03:14.112 --> 03:17.198
But how fiendishly clever of you.

03:17.407 --> 03:21.744
And how handsome you are, Bat-doll.

03:21.953 --> 03:24.622
Watch out for a trick, Batman.

03:24.831 --> 03:28.918
Don't worry, Robin.
She won't catch us off guard this time.

03:29.127 --> 03:31.796
You needn't try to short circuit our brains,
Black Widow.

03:31.963 --> 03:36.968
We're still wearing our anti-short circuit
Bat-brain electrodes.

03:37.176 --> 03:39.595
Batman, I've lost one of my electrodes.

03:40.346 --> 03:43.474
Bad luck, old chum,
but perhaps I can pull off a bluff.

03:43.683 --> 03:48.604
No amount of UHF short circuiting
can affect the brain of either Robin or me.

03:48.813 --> 03:53.234
Are you definitely wearing
your electrodes, darlings?

03:53.443 --> 03:54.569
- Definitely.
-Definitely.

03:55.194 --> 03:58.614
Marvelous, because I've reversed...

03:58.823 --> 04:03.911
...the polarity on my brainwave
short circuiter.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.914
Just an added little precaution.

04:07.123 --> 04:11.335
And with the electrodes on, you've had it.

04:18.968 --> 04:23.014
You, she-devil.
Have you short circuited Batman's brain?

04:24.390 --> 04:28.060
No cause for alarm, Robin.
I feel fine, just fine.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.438
You see, Robin baby.

04:30.605 --> 04:32.815
Now be a good little Boy Wonder...

04:33.024 --> 04:36.235
...and do just as I say.

04:36.444 --> 04:39.614
No, I will not submit to your treachery!

04:39.822 --> 04:42.617
Trap Door, sweetie pie, you're needed.

04:44.911 --> 04:48.039
Wrap up Robin, my boys.

04:48.873 --> 04:53.085
Ah! Very good, kiddies.
You're learning the business. Ha-ha-ha.

04:53.252 --> 04:56.380
Now, is there anything I can do for you,
Black Widow?

04:56.589 --> 05:02.011
As a matter of fact, there is.
I have a perfectly devastating idea.

05:02.220 --> 05:07.266
Masked Muscles, you go back
through the tunnel into my main web...

05:07.475 --> 05:11.437
...and have a little drink
to the latest development. Ha, ha.

05:11.646 --> 05:15.107
- How does that grab you, doll?
-Fine.

05:15.274 --> 05:18.736
- Could we take Robin along too?
-But of course.

05:18.945 --> 05:23.407
No Robin, no Dynamic Duo.

05:23.574 --> 05:25.368
<i>- N'est-ce pas?
- Ha, ha.</i>

05:38.965 --> 05:41.008
Now, I imagine Robin
is getting a bit heavy?

05:41.217 --> 05:45.805
Boys, I'm sure the Bat-doll
would like to get rid of him.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.224
Better tie him up.

06:02.989 --> 06:07.785
Well, Bat-doll, perhaps you would
like some champagne?

06:07.994 --> 06:11.372
I never touch spirits.
Have you some milk?

06:11.789 --> 06:15.585
Milk? Oh, yes, yes.

06:15.793 --> 06:18.129
Oh, maybe Trap Door has some.

06:18.337 --> 06:22.508
Trap Door, have you got any milk in there?

06:23.384 --> 06:25.219
Thank you.

06:25.428 --> 06:28.639
- Perhaps you'd like to mix your own.
-Thank you.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.582
Delicious milk.

06:54.790 --> 07:00.296
Well, now, my dear,
this may come as a surprise to you...

07:00.504 --> 07:02.173
...but I have a little problem.

07:02.381 --> 07:05.718
You, Black Widow?
I thought business was good.

07:05.927 --> 07:09.931
Business is boring.
I've completely run out of banks to rob.

07:10.139 --> 07:14.602
I've run through them all.
Now, that's where you may come in handy.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.228
Me? How?

07:16.437 --> 07:19.315
Well, everyone's heard
about your Batcave...

07:19.523 --> 07:23.611
...and everyone's heard
about your Batcomputer in your Batcave.

07:24.278 --> 07:25.696
Oh.

07:26.572 --> 07:32.078
You want me to get the Batcomputer
to give you a bank to rob.

07:32.286 --> 07:35.414
Precisely. Do you think
that you could send for it?

07:35.623 --> 07:38.000
We don't have to send for it.

07:38.209 --> 07:40.962
I have right here in my Utility Belt...

07:43.255 --> 07:46.592
...a remote control Batcomputer oscillator.

07:46.759 --> 07:48.010
Oh, heh.

07:48.177 --> 07:51.472
- How convenient. How does it work?
-Simple. I just press this button...

07:51.681 --> 07:54.642
...and it activates the radio frequency
Bat-generator.

07:54.850 --> 07:57.645
- And I just talk to it?
-No, I talk into it.

07:57.853 --> 08:00.022
It wouldn't recognize your voice.

08:00.231 --> 08:03.859
Now, question:

08:04.443 --> 08:07.488
ls there any bank in Gotham City...

08:07.697 --> 08:11.450
...which Black Widow has not robbed?

08:14.537 --> 08:17.248
My word, wherever he is...

08:17.415 --> 08:22.253
...Batman must be operating his
remote control Batcomputer oscillator.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.340
Ah. Here we are.

08:26.549 --> 08:31.220
The just-opened
Heritage First National Bank.

08:32.304 --> 08:35.640
How perfectly lovely. Ha-ha-ha!

08:38.644 --> 08:42.982
Again? It must be adding something.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.570
Wait a minute,
it's sending a further message.

08:47.778 --> 08:50.531
- What is, darling?
-Here.

08:51.490 --> 08:57.204
"Seen with Black Widow.
Batman's life in great danger?"

08:57.413 --> 09:02.418
Oh, it really seems as if your criminal career
is over even before it starts.

09:02.626 --> 09:06.839
But I am certainly not going to risk your life.

09:08.424 --> 09:10.885
Let's take the gamble.

09:11.093 --> 09:14.847
Batcomputer's known to be wrong
when it's elected to go off on its own, right?

09:15.514 --> 09:18.434
Ah, ha, ha. No, but I have a brilliant idea.

09:18.642 --> 09:22.563
Tarantula, go upstairs,
get Grandpa off his rocker...

09:22.772 --> 09:26.025
...and bring him down here quickly.

09:26.233 --> 09:30.571
Batman, you wouldn't by any chance
happen to have an extra Batsuit...

09:30.780 --> 09:33.574
...just kind of lying around, would you?

09:33.783 --> 09:36.744
Oh, yes, as a matter of fact, we do.

09:38.788 --> 09:41.373
Lovely. Lovely.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.627
Now, Tarantula, I want you
to bring my makeup kit...

09:44.835 --> 09:49.090
...and I want you to make Grandpa
to look exactly like Batman...

09:49.298 --> 09:52.051
...and I will make myself up to look
exactly like Robin.

09:52.259 --> 09:56.013
Now, look here, darling,
I want you to call the manager...

09:56.222 --> 09:59.809
...of the just-opened
Heritage First National Bank.

10:00.017 --> 10:04.271
You may use my Web Phone. Try it.

10:08.484 --> 10:13.114
<i>NARRATOR". While Black Widow hatches
her plot, at Commissioner Gordon's office...</i>

10:13.322 --> 10:15.825
I don't know what he's doing
behind that mask of his...

10:16.033 --> 10:19.578
...but at least there haven't been
any bank robberies in quite a while.

10:19.787 --> 10:24.166
- That's a good sign, isn't it, Chief O'Hara?
-A very good sign.

10:24.375 --> 10:29.130
Caped Crusader probably has Black Widow
under lock and key at this very minute.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.677
- Commissioner Gordon.
-This is Irving Irving...

10:34.844 --> 10:37.179
...at the just-opened
Heritage First National Bank.

10:37.388 --> 10:40.975
- Yes, Mr. Irving.
-I just had a call from Batman.

10:41.183 --> 10:45.896
He wants me to take $40,000
in a brown paper bag to the front of the bank...

10:46.105 --> 10:51.110
...at exactly 11:43 this morning.
-Well, that sounds odd, Mr. Irving.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.320
He says the Batmobile will be parked there.

10:53.529 --> 10:57.241
And he's arranged for Black Widow
to meet him and they will split the money.

10:57.449 --> 11:00.536
Oh, well, then do it by all means.

11:00.744 --> 11:03.622
<i>- Thank you for calling, Mr. Irving.
- All right, commissioner.</i>

11:04.790 --> 11:05.958
Ha!

11:06.125 --> 11:10.754
Apparently, Batman is springing a trap
on Black Widow. That's good.

11:16.051 --> 11:19.805
Are you sure you're gonna be able to drive
the Batmobile from the passenger side?

11:20.014 --> 11:25.561
Perfectly, Tarantula. What time is it, doll?

11:26.353 --> 11:28.397
Exactly 11 :37.

11:28.606 --> 11:34.862
Got to run, sweetheart.
Keep an eye on the Dynamic Duo.

11:35.070 --> 11:38.991
While my Batman and Robin do their stuff.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.994
Ta-da, darling.

11:50.502 --> 11:55.716
Well, Chief O'Hara, Black Widow's caper
should be just about over.

11:55.925 --> 11:58.969
And I should be hearing from Batman now.

12:00.346 --> 12:02.973
Yes, right on schedule.

12:03.182 --> 12:06.101
Why isn't he calling on the Batphone?

12:07.645 --> 12:09.647
Commissioner Gordon. Ah, ha-ha-ha.

12:12.566 --> 12:18.530
Ro-- Robin did what, Mr. Irving?

12:20.032 --> 12:21.408
Oh.

12:21.784 --> 12:27.206
Thank you for calling, sir.
Yes, we'll get out a bulletin right away.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.793
Glory be, commissioner. What's wrong?

12:31.001 --> 12:36.674
The just-opened Heritage First National Bank
has just been robbed.

12:36.882 --> 12:41.845
- By Batman and Robin.
-Saints preserve us.

12:42.054 --> 12:46.934
Yes, indeed, saints preserve us
if the Caped Crusaders have gone crooked.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.686
Which apparently they have.

12:48.894 --> 12:53.607
Mr. Irving could hardly have dreamed
that this happened.

12:53.816 --> 12:59.822
Chief O'Hara, I want an APB to all units
for the arrest of Batman.

13:00.030 --> 13:06.120
Hopefully alive, but we'll take him
the other way if we have to.

13:08.247 --> 13:10.708
<i>Attention all units. Be on alert for Batman.</i>

13:10.916 --> 13:13.585
<i>First name unknown. Caucasian.</i>

13:13.794 --> 13:18.507
<i>Height: 6'2, wearing purple trunks,
purple cape, purple cowl...</i>

13:18.716 --> 13:20.968
<i>...and a black bat insignia on his chest.</i>

13:21.135 --> 13:24.305
<i>He has a masked accomplice
whose alias is Robin.</i>

13:24.513 --> 13:28.267
<i>Approach with caution. They may be armed.</i>

13:48.287 --> 13:51.081
I hate to do it, Caped Crusader,
but I have to take you in.

13:51.290 --> 13:53.083
You're on the wanted list.

13:53.292 --> 13:56.670
My gun's pointed at you, Caped Crusader.
Don't make me use it.

13:56.879 --> 14:00.883
Think Batman is afraid of you, Copper?

14:01.091 --> 14:04.345
Go on and shoot. I dare you.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.430
What's happened to you, Boy Wonder?

14:06.638 --> 14:08.557
Even your voice has turned snarly.

14:08.766 --> 14:12.102
None of your business, Flatfoot.

14:12.311 --> 14:17.107
Now, go ahead and shoot,
because you'll never take us alive.

14:17.733 --> 14:21.904
Batman, I'm giving you three
to get out of the car with your hands up.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.073
One.

14:24.490 --> 14:25.949
Two.

14:26.742 --> 14:28.160
Three.

14:32.498 --> 14:35.209
I couldn't have missed at such close range.

14:36.001 --> 14:38.253
I've killed Batman!

14:40.881 --> 14:43.425
Red six on a black seven!

14:44.468 --> 14:46.553
I certainly don't wish to be rude...

14:46.762 --> 14:52.226
...but normally the game of solitaire
requires only one player. Ha, ha.

14:55.604 --> 14:59.441
Oh, come on, Batman, cheat a little.
Or it ain't no fun!

15:02.027 --> 15:06.573
Why don't you two kibitzers go outside
and wait for Black Widow?

15:07.366 --> 15:09.243
- All that loot. Sure.
-Yes.

15:09.451 --> 15:11.161
Trap Door!

15:13.414 --> 15:14.915
Come on.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.198
Batman.

15:48.407 --> 15:50.784
- Who untied you?
-I untied myself.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.703
- Was that wise?
-Yes.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.997
And I want you to do me a favor.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.541
- What?
-Sing a song for me.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.960
- Loud.
-Oh.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.837
All right. Ahem.

16:02.754 --> 16:05.632
- How about some Gilbert and Sullivan?
-Fine.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.426
Ha, ha.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.763
<i>I'm called little Buttercup</i>

16:13.140 --> 16:16.059
<i>Dear little Buttercup</i>

16:16.268 --> 16:19.229
<i>Though I could never tell why</i>

16:19.396 --> 16:20.689
A little louder.

16:20.856 --> 16:24.151
<i>But still I'm called Buttercup</i>

16:24.318 --> 16:27.529
<i>Pool little Buttercup</i>

16:28.030 --> 16:31.575
<i>Sweet little Buttercup, I</i>

16:38.081 --> 16:40.125
Robin? What's happening?

16:40.334 --> 16:44.671
Batman, I want you to come with me
later today and rob a bank.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.299
Robin, don't even joke
about such a thing.

16:47.508 --> 16:49.343
Have you lost all your sense
of judgment?

16:49.510 --> 16:51.720
Holy reverse polarity, I did it!

16:51.929 --> 16:54.473
I got you out of Black Widow's clutches!

16:55.140 --> 16:57.017
Of course, I knew what I was doing...

16:57.226 --> 17:00.103
...but with my cerebrum short circuited
I couldn't stop myself.

17:00.312 --> 17:04.191
You sit down here, Robin.
I'll retie your hands...

17:06.984 --> 17:12.449
...and pretend that my brain
is still short circuited.

17:12.657 --> 17:16.869
Sure and it's a dark hour in Gotham City,
commissioner.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.664
Yes.

17:19.705 --> 17:23.585
But I was faced with the decision
and I had to make it.

17:23.794 --> 17:26.088
How will we be breaking the news
to the people?

17:26.296 --> 17:27.714
We'll tell them the truth.

17:27.923 --> 17:31.260
Batman was shot and killed
when he and Robin...

17:31.718 --> 17:33.303
Robin?

17:33.762 --> 17:35.806
No doubt he's gone into hiding.

17:36.014 --> 17:38.350
Most likely in the Batcave.

17:38.559 --> 17:42.187
Maybe I can talk to him.
Get him to surrender.

17:42.396 --> 17:45.065
So no more
of the Dynamic Duo's blood...

17:45.274 --> 17:47.734
...will be spilled on the streets
of our fair city.

17:48.694 --> 17:50.904
I'm sorry, sir. Batman is not here.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.155
I know that.

17:52.364 --> 17:56.827
- We've lost the Caped Crusader.
-Lost?

17:57.035 --> 17:59.788
One of our officers
was forced to shoot Batman.

17:59.955 --> 18:02.416
<i>And the Boy Wonder has become
one of Gotham City's...</i>

18:02.624 --> 18:05.168
...ten most wanted men. Boys.

18:05.377 --> 18:07.462
Is he there hiding out?

18:07.671 --> 18:10.882
No, I'm afraid not, sir.

18:11.091 --> 18:14.803
But-- But isn't it possible
that a mistake has been made?

18:15.012 --> 18:17.723
No mistake was made. Why?

18:17.931 --> 18:21.893
Well, it's a long
and rather involved story, sir.

18:22.102 --> 18:27.274
You see, earlier today,
Batman activated the Batcomputer...

18:27.482 --> 18:31.361
...via his remote control
Batcomputer oscillator.

18:31.570 --> 18:32.696
Remote control?

18:32.904 --> 18:34.948
I took the liberty...

18:35.157 --> 18:39.369
...of getting some information
from the, uh, Batcomputer myself.

18:39.578 --> 18:42.497
Batman activated the computer...

18:42.706 --> 18:47.002
...from, uh, "411 Larva Drive."

18:47.586 --> 18:51.590
-411 Larva Drive.
-Larva Drive.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.718
Sounds like a good place
for Black Widow's hideout.

18:54.926 --> 18:57.054
Thank you. We'll get on it right away.

18:57.262 --> 19:00.098
Get some men and some squad cars,
and let's go.

19:09.232 --> 19:12.110
I'm back, boys.

19:18.825 --> 19:22.663
Well, now, after a brief encounter
with the law...

19:23.330 --> 19:29.628
...and a quick change in the lady's lounge--
Oh, Grandpa's back too on the porch.

19:29.836 --> 19:33.215
Guess what I have in this tiny little bag.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.842
- More stolen money?
-What else?

19:36.051 --> 19:39.680
Oh, Batman, you were out of this world.

19:39.888 --> 19:42.432
And, of course, I was adorable...

19:42.641 --> 19:45.227
...as baby Boy Wonder.

19:48.063 --> 19:50.899
Robin's pretty good as a Boy Wonder too.

19:52.401 --> 19:54.820
You bet I am, Batman.

19:56.488 --> 19:58.365
Let's get them.

20:12.295 --> 20:16.883
Now, what did I do
with that silly short circuiting device?

20:17.092 --> 20:20.470
You mean, what did I do with it,
you obsessed woman.

21:10.228 --> 21:11.938
Black Widow.

21:12.147 --> 21:17.611
First of all, Robin and I will wanna return
all the stolen moneys to banks A through H.

21:17.819 --> 21:20.280
What a perfect idea.

21:20.489 --> 21:23.450
- And secondly--
Batman.

21:23.658 --> 21:25.202
Oh, it's really you.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.579
In cape and cowl, commissioner. Why?

21:27.788 --> 21:32.083
<i>- I'll</i> explain later, but thank heaven.
- And this is Black Widow.

21:32.793 --> 21:36.797
So you're the she-devil who's been robbing us
out of house and home.

21:37.005 --> 21:40.717
Oh, you must be Chief O'Hara.

21:40.926 --> 21:44.387
What a delightful surprise.

21:45.597 --> 21:49.726
Why don't you ask her if she'd like
to go along to jail with you, Chief O'Hara?

21:49.935 --> 21:51.812
Oh, don't ask.

21:52.020 --> 21:55.106
My heart says no...

21:55.315 --> 21:59.319
...but my brain says yes, love.

21:59.528 --> 22:01.571
I feel it's my responsibility to tell you...

22:01.738 --> 22:05.158
...that you have the constitutional right
to consult with your attorney...

22:05.325 --> 22:06.910
...before answering any questions.
-Ah!

22:07.118 --> 22:11.039
But I want to answer his questions.

22:11.248 --> 22:18.046
Sweetheart, I cannot tell you how much
you remind me of my dear departed Max.

22:18.255 --> 22:21.299
- You'd better come with me, Black Widow.
-Thank you.

22:23.385 --> 22:26.847
Goldberg, you take care
of the rest of them.

22:50.704 --> 22:53.874
I can't wait to see how it turns out, angel.

22:54.082 --> 22:58.378
If it really looks good,
I'd love to have you come over every day...

22:58.587 --> 23:01.715
...and give me a wash and set.

23:03.341 --> 23:05.594
Why don't we have a look?

23:05.760 --> 23:07.345
Ah!

23:07.512 --> 23:12.017
Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.

23:12.225 --> 23:15.937
And only Batman knows for sure.

23:16.563 --> 23:21.234
Batman there's a question
I got to be asking you and the Boy Wonder.

23:21.902 --> 23:23.570
Yes, chief?

23:23.945 --> 23:27.908
With all the crime that you and Robin
should be out fighting...

23:28.116 --> 23:32.704
...how do you find time to come here
and fix Black Widow's coiffeur?

23:32.913 --> 23:35.415
Those aren't hair dryers, Chief O'Hara.

23:35.582 --> 23:39.753
They're Bat Wave Brain Analyzers,
which Robin and I have slightly rewired.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.255
Oh, you mean you're not
really fixing their hair?

23:42.422 --> 23:45.133
Right. What we're doing
is decriminalizing them.

23:45.342 --> 23:48.637
It may take months of treatment,
but we feel it's worth a try.

23:48.845 --> 23:52.057
If we can permanently short circuit
the bad streaks in them...

23:52.265 --> 23:57.646
...we will make honest useful citizens
out of those spidery crooks.

23:57.854 --> 24:02.275
Chief O'Hara, do you realize what time it is'?

24:02.484 --> 24:04.819
I'm famished.

24:05.028 --> 24:08.531
Please bring me a menu, doll.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.284
And don't forget the wine list.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.286
You heard the lady, chief. Get a menu.

24:13.453 --> 24:14.454
Yes. Yes, ma'am.

24:14.663 --> 24:17.999
A menu and a wine list.
I'll see if I can locate them.

24:18.208 --> 24:23.046
Divine, darling. Absolutely divine.
