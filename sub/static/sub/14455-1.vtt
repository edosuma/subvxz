00:11.833 --> 00:14.867
Narrator: Coming up...
what's got Joe going balls out?

00:19.267 --> 00:21.067
Why is Sal
down in the dumps?

00:21.067 --> 00:22.333
I love to dance,

00:22.333 --> 00:24.633
but I had diarrhea, so...

00:26.133 --> 00:28.667
And which losing Joker
will sink or swim

00:28.667 --> 00:30.033
in tonight's punishment?

00:31.733 --> 00:34.567
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:34.567 --> 00:35.633
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:37.333 --> 00:38.967
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:40.767 --> 00:43.533
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:43.533 --> 00:45.533
Joe: Larry!

00:49.567 --> 00:51.100
Today, us and Murray

00:51.100 --> 00:52.967
are working in a busy office
as a receptionist.

00:52.967 --> 00:54.300
While working
behind the desk,

00:54.300 --> 00:56.567
we'll have to do and say
whatever the other guys tell us.

00:56.567 --> 00:58.500
If you refuse, you lose.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.800
Why'd you say, "Murray"?
Because you look like
the boss.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.867
You don't look like
the receptionist.
Yeah, you...

01:02.867 --> 01:05.367
You look like Dabney Coleman
in "9 to 5."

01:09.833 --> 01:11.367
Joe: Sal, you hungry?
I'm a bit.

01:11.367 --> 01:13.167
Good. Turkey sandwich
is in the drawer.

01:15.133 --> 01:16.567
-There you go.
-Yeah.

01:16.567 --> 01:18.367
Murr:
Open it up on your seat,

01:18.367 --> 01:20.333
and kneel on the floor
and eat it.

01:20.333 --> 01:22.700
Should it be his seat,
or...
No no no, should be
one of these seats.

01:22.700 --> 01:24.533
Oh, come on.

01:24.533 --> 01:27.267
**

01:27.267 --> 01:29.067
Joe: Kneel in front of it.

01:29.067 --> 01:30.667
This is where
you take your lunch break.
Yeah.

01:33.867 --> 01:35.567
Oh, there's two people.

01:35.567 --> 01:37.833
Um...

01:37.833 --> 01:39.267
Sorry. guys.
I was on lunch.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.533
Have a seat,
have a seat.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.433
Well, you got to eat.
Sorry.

01:42.433 --> 01:43.800
I had no break today.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.300
Take your time.
We all human.

01:45.300 --> 01:46.967
We get it.

01:46.967 --> 01:48.167
Joe: This guy's eating
a sandwich, too.

01:48.167 --> 01:49.200
Grab a piece of paper.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.567
Write in big letters,
"No eating."

01:50.567 --> 01:53.400
Tape it, and smack it right
behind the guy's head.

02:10.700 --> 02:12.567
Murr:
Sal, pick up the phone,

02:12.567 --> 02:14.400
and I want you
to have a conversation,

02:14.400 --> 02:17.067
but make it seem like
you're talking to the
people in the room.

02:17.067 --> 02:18.333
Are you waiting
for the focus group?

02:18.333 --> 02:19.933
Yeah.

02:19.933 --> 02:22.367
So then, I don't know what
you want to do,

02:22.367 --> 02:23.900
but you can
tell Sandra that.

02:27.767 --> 02:29.800
Joe: Oh, you can't bring your
cellphone here either.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.300
No eating,
no cellphone, right?
No.

02:31.300 --> 02:32.733
Sal, make a sign that says,
"No Cellphones,"

02:32.733 --> 02:34.067
and smack it on the wall.

02:35.233 --> 02:38.100
**

02:45.333 --> 02:47.133
Sal: He put it away!

02:47.133 --> 02:50.500
Hey, guys, I planned
a little surprise for Sal.
What do you got?

02:51.800 --> 02:54.433
Sal, it's over.

02:54.433 --> 02:56.133
We are through!

02:56.133 --> 02:57.733
Here's your stuff.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.900
And, please,

03:01.900 --> 03:05.067
no more sexting!

03:07.600 --> 03:09.433
Joe: Sal, take a pen,
write on the paper,

03:09.433 --> 03:11.467
"No More Sexting,"
and smack it up on the wall.

03:15.600 --> 03:16.867
**

03:16.867 --> 03:18.200
Excuse me, sorry.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.633
Excuse me.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.900
Murr: "No cellphones,
no eating, no sexting."

03:24.900 --> 03:26.967
We've all been there,
right, guys?

03:34.500 --> 03:37.067
-Hi, hello.
-Hello. Good to meet you.

03:37.067 --> 03:39.200
Desiree.
Desiree, nice to see you.
I'm Joseph.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.400
Joe, top drawer left,
bag of chips.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.567
Go to town.

03:43.833 --> 03:45.467
Joe: Desiree,
what borough do you live in?

03:45.467 --> 03:47.167
Desiree:
Um, I'm in Brooklyn.

03:47.167 --> 03:50.467
Brooklyn.
That's really nice.
Yeah.

03:50.467 --> 03:53.067
Yeah.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.467
Om nom.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.767
Yum yum.

04:03.733 --> 04:05.067
Traffic going there
sometimes is rough.

04:05.067 --> 04:07.067
Yeah.
Especially with
the train schedule.

04:07.067 --> 04:08.133
Sometimes I get so...

04:13.767 --> 04:16.233
Q: Joe, start digging
through the trash.

04:16.233 --> 04:18.233
My sandwich is in there
from my turn.

04:18.233 --> 04:19.500
Tell him to fish it out
and eat it.

04:21.067 --> 04:23.100
Joe, Joe...

04:23.100 --> 04:26.067
Sal's sandwich
is still in there from his turn.

04:26.067 --> 04:28.567
So, just dive into the garbage
and get it.

04:30.867 --> 04:32.433
Go in that garbage can,
dude,

04:32.433 --> 04:34.633
and just go to town
on that sandwich.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.233
Oh, bingo.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.600
Make noises, though.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.367
Like, eat like crazy.

04:48.367 --> 04:50.067
Mmm.

04:50.067 --> 04:51.233
Om nom.

04:53.633 --> 04:54.967
Nom.

04:54.967 --> 04:57.133
Yum, yum.
Yum, yum, yum.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.967
Joe, could you sneeze food
all over the wall?

05:01.967 --> 05:04.733
Oh, this is gonna be
too gross for me.
Murr: Uh-oh, uh-oh, sneeze!

05:15.167 --> 05:16.367
Yeah, I'm great.

05:16.367 --> 05:19.067
It's just my allergies
are kicking in.

05:19.067 --> 05:21.633
Q's throwing up!

05:21.633 --> 05:22.767
Q threw up.

05:22.767 --> 05:24.600
Q's throwing up!

05:24.600 --> 05:26.567
I can't hear that
too many more times.
Q: Ohh.

05:28.367 --> 05:29.700
I can't even take it.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.367
You're eating
lo mein?

05:33.100 --> 05:35.067
Q: Joey,
get that medicine ball.

05:35.067 --> 05:36.100
Look to your right.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.933
Joe, they say
that's better for posture.

05:37.933 --> 05:40.633
You know, if you're working
long hours at a desk.

05:40.633 --> 05:42.800
I swap out after 7:00
for the posture.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.967
Oh, okay.

05:43.967 --> 05:47.100
And, have no idea how
to properly use it, buddy.

05:47.100 --> 05:51.067
They're really good
for posture and stuff.

05:56.433 --> 05:58.067
Watch the table.
Watch the table.

06:01.567 --> 06:02.867
It rolled.

06:02.867 --> 06:05.267
Joe, if you can fall down
and knock over the garbage can,

06:05.267 --> 06:07.433
the sandwich comes
out, and you start
eating the sandwich,

06:07.433 --> 06:09.400
I will dropkick
every single person in this room

06:09.400 --> 06:10.300
if you pull that off.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.067
It's supposed to stick.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.267
Oh, okay.

06:23.567 --> 06:25.067
Um...

06:28.900 --> 06:30.100
Oh, no, I'm all right.

06:30.100 --> 06:31.167
No, I'm good.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.400
Om nom nom.

06:37.867 --> 06:39.767
Joe: Q, you look
a little sleepy, bud.

06:39.767 --> 06:42.733
That's just 'cause of
my general life fitness.

06:42.733 --> 06:44.100
Well, why don't you
take a quick nap.

06:44.100 --> 06:45.767
Why don't you be asleep
when this guy walks in.

06:50.333 --> 06:52.233
Murr: That's great --
mouth open.

06:57.433 --> 06:58.900
Q's sleeping.
Sal: Q...

06:58.900 --> 07:02.367
don't move
and don't make a sound.

07:05.167 --> 07:06.733
Oh...

07:06.733 --> 07:07.900
This guy's
just sitting there.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.333
He's not even
looking at you.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.267
How long before the guy
gets up and goes, "Excuse me?"

07:11.267 --> 07:13.567
I say he doesn't say a word
in 30 minutes.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.200
Without getting up,
without saying a word?

07:15.200 --> 07:16.467
I don't believe
he's going to.

07:16.467 --> 07:18.400
Let's find out.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.067
Q, we're gonna
make you stay like this

07:20.067 --> 07:21.533
for a half hour, okay?

07:22.667 --> 07:25.600
Can we get a clock
on the screen?

07:32.267 --> 07:34.833
If this guy sits there
for 30 minutes

07:34.833 --> 07:35.933
without getting up...

07:35.933 --> 07:37.300
It's amazing.

07:42.133 --> 07:43.333
This is crazy.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.067
This guys's got his head
in his phone the whole time.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.467
Guys,
he's gonna unravel.

07:53.467 --> 07:54.633
I can't believe this.

07:54.633 --> 07:55.833
I'm getting nervous
that he's gonna get up

07:55.833 --> 07:56.633
and ruin our streak.

08:02.333 --> 08:03.767
I can't believe

08:03.767 --> 08:05.633
he hasn't tried to
at least even walk over...

08:05.633 --> 08:07.433
Oh, no, no!
He's looking up!
Oh!

08:07.433 --> 08:09.467
First time
he's out of his phone!

08:09.467 --> 08:11.233
He's out of his phone.
He's looking around now.

08:11.233 --> 08:12.700
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.967
Dude, I told you.
It's gonna all fall apart.

08:17.967 --> 08:20.400
Yes!
He's back on the phone!
He's back on the phone!

08:20.400 --> 08:22.067
He's back on the phone!
Whoo!

08:27.967 --> 08:29.533
I'm so  excited!

08:29.533 --> 08:31.967
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh!

08:31.967 --> 08:33.833
Shh! Shh! Shh!

08:33.833 --> 08:35.567
Joe: Everybody
shut the  up.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.267
Don't --
Settle down!

08:38.267 --> 08:40.900
Sal: Oh, my God.

08:40.900 --> 08:45.567
All:
Five, four, three, two, one.

08:46.767 --> 08:48.200
Shh,
shut the  up!
30 minutes!

08:48.200 --> 08:49.733
Joe: Q, here's what we want you
to do, okay?

08:49.733 --> 08:50.867
We want you
to wake yourself up,

08:50.867 --> 08:53.833
and to show him the picture
that's on your desk.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.667
When this guy signed up
for the focus group,

08:55.667 --> 08:57.067
we went on
his social media profile,

08:57.067 --> 08:59.667
printed out a picture of him,
and put it in a frame.

08:59.667 --> 09:00.833
Hey.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.267
Hey.

09:04.967 --> 09:06.567
Oh, snap.

09:06.567 --> 09:07.633
That's you.

09:07.633 --> 09:09.500
They're ready for you.
You can go in.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.733
They're ready for you.

09:16.667 --> 09:18.300
Hi. What's your name?

09:18.300 --> 09:19.933
-Richard.
-Richard, got it.

09:21.367 --> 09:22.800
Joe: Murr,
just cut your tie off.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.533
Just, yeah -- grab the scissors
in front of you.

09:29.367 --> 09:31.400
Just got to
shred these papers.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.133
You've never done
a focus group before?

09:34.133 --> 09:35.433
Well, actually did one,

09:35.433 --> 09:37.200
but it wasn't
like a full-term thing.
Yeah, yeah.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.367
Do you, um...

09:38.367 --> 09:40.300
Murr: You know the way it works,
though, right?

09:40.300 --> 09:41.833
You go in and they ask you,
like, these questions

09:41.833 --> 09:43.267
that they have no idea.

09:43.267 --> 09:46.700
They have no idea, like,
what the brand is.

09:46.700 --> 09:47.633
You're cutting your tie.

09:47.633 --> 09:49.067
Oh

09:50.300 --> 09:51.567
I got a new tie
in the back.

09:51.567 --> 09:52.700
Give me one second,
okay?

09:52.700 --> 09:54.433
I got a -- I got another outfit
in the back.

09:54.433 --> 09:55.833
Do me a favor.
Grab that bucket of water.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.300
Sal: Come stand in this.

09:57.300 --> 09:59.233
Stand right here
for a second.

09:59.233 --> 10:02.100
Okay,
let me help you in.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.000
What is going --
What's going --
What is going on?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.133
Just pour it
over his head.

10:05.133 --> 10:06.400
No! No! No way!

10:06.400 --> 10:07.433
No! No! No way!

10:07.433 --> 10:08.500
No!
What

10:08.500 --> 10:09.667
What are you
talking about?

10:09.667 --> 10:10.967
Your tie's messed up.
What are we doing?

10:10.967 --> 10:12.967
It's a refuse-you-lose
situation.

10:12.967 --> 10:14.933
What it -- Fine.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.367
I didn't have
another tie.

10:22.367 --> 10:23.867
Oh, you just went outside?

10:23.867 --> 10:26.267
No, I didn't go outside.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Murr, take a call.

10:32.267 --> 10:34.233
Now, Murr,
get up and casually,

10:34.233 --> 10:35.433
while on the phone,

10:35.433 --> 10:36.900
stroll over
to the elevators.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.367
Yeah.

10:38.367 --> 10:40.400
I'll probably be home
at, like, 8:30 or so.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.567
What'd she say
when you told her?

10:42.567 --> 10:45.767
One sec.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:45.767 --> 10:47.233
It's a 100-foot cord.

10:47.233 --> 10:50.000
Get in the elevator.

10:52.233 --> 10:53.467
I don't know
what's going on, baby.

10:53.467 --> 10:54.600
We have to figure it out.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.767
Yo, what the  son?

10:59.433 --> 11:00.700
Shh.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.700
Yo, what the
is going on?

11:02.700 --> 11:04.267
Come back up.
All right, come back up.

11:09.333 --> 11:11.100
I thought
I was on my cellphone.

11:14.467 --> 11:16.567
I was on the phone
with my girlfriend.

11:16.567 --> 11:17.600
I totally slipped.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.867
Okay, Murr.
It's time to close up.

11:18.867 --> 11:20.933
Shut all the lights off
one by one

11:20.933 --> 11:23.067
and just get the hell
out of there.

11:23.067 --> 11:25.733
Almost quitting time
for me.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.067
Closing time.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.067
This one.

11:34.067 --> 11:35.733
There we go.

11:38.300 --> 11:41.533
I think -- just to make sure
that these are off.

11:41.533 --> 11:42.600
Okay.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.467
Okay, the fax machine...

11:45.467 --> 11:46.600
Now, just leave
and get in the elevator.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.067
Good night, bud.

11:48.067 --> 11:49.300
All right.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.267
Narrator:
It was success at the desk
for the guys,

11:53.267 --> 11:55.933
so they're all safe
from the loser board.

11:55.933 --> 11:57.500
Today,
we're walking around the park

11:57.500 --> 11:59.433
talking to strangers
about a personal dilemma.

11:59.433 --> 12:02.133
Here's the catch --
this dilemma's gonna
be very weird,

12:02.133 --> 12:04.233
because it's given to us
by the other guys.

12:04.233 --> 12:05.533
Right, and if you can't
get the stranger

12:05.533 --> 12:07.400
to give you
some concrete, sound advice

12:07.400 --> 12:08.900
on this ridiculous
dilemma...

12:08.900 --> 12:10.467
Then you lose.
That's right.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.167
Much better.

12:17.167 --> 12:18.333
Murr: Do you mind
if I interrupt --

12:18.333 --> 12:19.800
I hate to interrupt
your conversation.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.467
Do you mind if I ask
your opinion on something?
Sure.

12:21.467 --> 12:22.767
All right, I made
a safe-for-work sexy tape

12:22.767 --> 12:24.067
with my girlfriend.

12:24.067 --> 12:27.800
I made a safe-for-work sexy tape
with my girlfriend.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.333
It was totally
in good taste.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.467
Yes, okay.

12:31.467 --> 12:33.100
But my boss still found it
distasteful,

12:33.100 --> 12:34.533
even though
it was safe for work.

12:34.533 --> 12:37.667
My boss, though,
found it totally distasteful.

12:37.667 --> 12:39.400
And now,
my girlfriend is mad at me

12:39.400 --> 12:40.900
'cause I work at prude city.

12:40.900 --> 12:43.200
Now, my girlfriend
is mad at me

12:43.200 --> 12:44.867
because she thinks
I work at prude city.

12:44.867 --> 12:46.600
And she wants me to quit.
She wants me to quit.

12:46.600 --> 12:47.800
What should I do?

12:53.333 --> 12:54.700
It's like a romance
kind of thing.

12:54.700 --> 12:56.300
We thought it was like --
it's like a parody.

12:56.300 --> 12:57.267
I thought it was hysterical.

12:57.267 --> 12:58.533
There's a lot of candles.

12:58.533 --> 13:00.567
There's incense burning
in one scene.

13:00.567 --> 13:01.400
We take a bath.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.633
It's a sexy tape.

13:09.300 --> 13:11.267
Sounds like somebody's
from prude city.

13:16.533 --> 13:18.067
Yes, please, please.
This is what I need.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.100
Ah!
Ah!

13:27.100 --> 13:28.100
Full-on engagement.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.400
Thank you so much.
Q: Wow.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.100
He got advice.

13:31.100 --> 13:33.467
Excuse me, can I get
your objective opinion

13:33.467 --> 13:34.733
on something real quick?
Okay.

13:34.733 --> 13:35.733
Would you mind?
No.

13:35.733 --> 13:37.200
I love to dance.
I need to dance.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.733
I have diarrhea.

13:38.733 --> 13:39.833
Murr: What do I do?

13:39.833 --> 13:42.367
.

13:42.367 --> 13:43.367
I love to dance.

13:43.367 --> 13:45.500
As a matter of fact,
I need to dance.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.567
But, I had diarrhea, so...

13:49.633 --> 13:51.067
She's packing up!

13:51.067 --> 13:52.500
All right, well,

13:52.500 --> 13:54.133
I've had enough
embarrassment for one day.

13:54.133 --> 13:55.467
I'll --
thank you for everything.

13:55.467 --> 13:56.533
Have a great day.

13:58.067 --> 13:59.167
Excuse me, sir?

13:59.167 --> 14:00.600
I'm kind of in a pickle,

14:00.600 --> 14:02.233
and I could really
use some advice.

14:02.233 --> 14:04.467
I'm clinically intrigued
by the society of mole people.

14:04.467 --> 14:06.900
I'm

14:06.900 --> 14:08.400
I'm clinically intrigued

14:08.400 --> 14:09.767
by the society of,
like, mole people

14:09.767 --> 14:11.067
living under the city.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.433
Have you heard of the mole
people?

14:12.433 --> 14:13.667
Sal: My P.O. says
I can't lay on the grate

14:13.667 --> 14:15.167
to communicate with them
anymore.

14:15.167 --> 14:17.167
But my P.O. says
I can't lay on the sewer grates

14:17.167 --> 14:18.633
and communicate
with them anymore,

14:18.633 --> 14:20.067
so I'm getting a lot of --

14:20.067 --> 14:21.800
I know this makes me sound
crazy. I swear I'm not.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.800
But I think one of them's
really taken a shine to me.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.067
But I think one of them's
really taken a shine to me.

14:26.067 --> 14:28.167
Do I take the risk?

14:28.167 --> 14:30.333
I don't know if my P.O.'s
watching me right now, or..

14:33.833 --> 14:35.700
For talking to mole people?
Yeah, yeah.

14:39.433 --> 14:40.667
What?
What?

14:40.667 --> 14:42.133
All right, cool.
Thanks buddy, thank you.

14:42.133 --> 14:43.300
That was unexpected.

14:46.067 --> 14:49.067
It's all about the body language
in the park, you know that.

14:49.067 --> 14:52.700
I have to look like
I have a dilemma.

14:52.700 --> 14:55.200
Oh, I got something
I'm dealing with.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.933
Q: You look like a southern
belle with the vapors.

14:58.667 --> 15:00.067
Thank God you're here.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.567
Let me bend your ear
for a minute.

15:02.567 --> 15:03.733
I got to bend your ear
for a minute.

15:03.733 --> 15:04.900
I got a situation
I need your help with.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.067
Hang up with them.

15:06.067 --> 15:08.167
Sal: He just calls her
right over!

15:08.167 --> 15:10.867
I promised myself I was gonna
solve this problem by 1:30.

15:10.867 --> 15:12.067
I'm dealing
with a dilemma.

15:12.067 --> 15:13.333
I need you to --
I need an objective opinion.

15:13.333 --> 15:16.067
I bought an old-timey
train ticket to New Hope.

15:16.067 --> 15:18.267
I just bought
an old-timey train ticket

15:18.267 --> 15:19.733
to New Hope, Pennsylvania.

15:19.733 --> 15:22.067
But my racist friend
Chen Chili got one too...

15:22.067 --> 15:23.733
But my racist friend

15:23.733 --> 15:25.333
Chen Chili bought one, too.

15:25.333 --> 15:28.500
And now, my probably-black
friend is coming, as well.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.200
And my probably-black friend
is gonna come.

15:32.300 --> 15:34.067
So, my friend's
probably black,

15:34.067 --> 15:36.567
but Chen Chili's
definitely racist.

15:36.567 --> 15:37.767
So, what do I do?

15:41.233 --> 15:42.367
Don't sit in the same car.

15:42.367 --> 15:43.600
So, segregate him
is what you're saying.

15:49.100 --> 15:50.533
If I want to
see Chen Chili --

15:50.533 --> 15:52.067
so I do a kind of
"Mrs. Doubtfire" scenario.
Yeah.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.500
Well, thank you.
You solved my dilemma,
appreciate it.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.500
Murr: Well done, Joe.
That was easy.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.767
Narrator: Here's a piece
of advice for Sal --

16:01.767 --> 16:03.967
good luck
in tonight's punishment.

16:03.967 --> 16:06.067
Well, Sal's our big loser.

16:06.067 --> 16:08.667
And we are here
in Astoria Sports Complex

16:08.667 --> 16:10.067
who, by happenstance,

16:10.067 --> 16:11.833
are looking to update
their website.

16:11.833 --> 16:13.800
Right, so of course they're
gonna need new photos.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.167
And where better
to start than their
water aerobics class.

16:18.067 --> 16:20.067
Are you ready for this?
I'm snapping photos for this?

16:20.067 --> 16:22.233
You're the photographer.
Yeah.
You're the photographer.

16:22.233 --> 16:23.500
Wait, what the
are you talking about?

16:24.533 --> 16:27.400
What the
Are you saying that...

16:27.400 --> 16:30.567
Yo, now I'm getting
all this in my head now.

16:30.567 --> 16:32.900
Now he gets it.

16:32.900 --> 16:35.900
Inhale as you expand up,
and exhale.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.233
Q: So, this is a real
water aerobics class.
Joe: Yes.

16:38.233 --> 16:40.167
The instructor
is in on it.
These people?

16:40.167 --> 16:41.500
Victims.
Victims.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.900
Murr: Who, by the way,

16:42.900 --> 16:44.400
have been told
to ignore the photographer.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.400
Q: Here he comes now.
Look at this!

16:46.400 --> 16:47.400
Here he is.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.233
Q: Oh, my God!

16:50.233 --> 16:52.067
My favorite part is that Sal
had to wear a shirt

16:52.067 --> 16:53.467
so we can hide
all the electronics.

16:53.467 --> 16:56.067
Sal, show us all the electronics
in your back.

16:56.067 --> 16:57.433
Look at that!

16:59.300 --> 17:01.433
He looks like
the hunchback of Best Buy.

17:04.100 --> 17:06.067
Lean to take a picture
of this instructor,

17:06.067 --> 17:07.433
and fall into the pool.

17:07.433 --> 17:09.567
Woman: Really push down.
Push down underneath you.

17:09.567 --> 17:12.133
Q: There he goes.
There he goes.

17:12.133 --> 17:15.133
There he goes.

17:15.133 --> 17:17.133
Joe: He can't do it!

17:17.133 --> 17:19.067
He can't do it!

17:19.067 --> 17:20.500
You got to lean closer,
lean closer.

17:22.100 --> 17:23.200
Just use the water.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.200
Sal: Whoopsie.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.267
How you doing, sir?
Sorry I crashed.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.600
He had the presence of mind

17:33.600 --> 17:37.100
to say, "Whoopsie"
before he hit the water.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.067
Woman: And press back.

17:40.067 --> 17:41.067
I want a little action
in this one,

17:41.067 --> 17:42.233
so I'm just gonna
splash some water up

17:42.233 --> 17:43.333
in front of the camera.

17:43.333 --> 17:44.567
Woman:
Remember to lift tall.

17:54.433 --> 17:56.667
Sal laughing.
He's got to go underwater.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.367
Sal, bounce and sink.

18:03.367 --> 18:04.900
**

18:04.900 --> 18:07.567
Woman: Really good, guys.

18:10.533 --> 18:12.967
And now flip quick
behind you.

18:15.833 --> 18:16.900
Selfie with
this guy behind you.

18:16.900 --> 18:20.267
Nice.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.133
Working those
outer thighs...

18:25.333 --> 18:27.867
Q: Sal, go underwater,
emerge too close to people,

18:27.867 --> 18:30.067
and take their photo
like right in their face.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.333
Sal, this guy's got a really
nice bathing suit, right?

18:49.333 --> 18:50.633
Q: He does.
Don't do it to me, Joe.

18:50.633 --> 18:51.467
Yeah, maybe we should get
a close up of the bathing suit?

18:51.467 --> 18:53.467
Q: He does.
Don't do it to me, Joe.

18:56.900 --> 18:58.333
Q: Here we go.

19:03.533 --> 19:04.867
Oh, my...

19:07.233 --> 19:09.333
Stop!
He's trying to get him.

19:09.333 --> 19:11.767
Murr: Look at the look
this guy just shot him.

19:11.767 --> 19:13.067
Keep going, keep going.

19:17.167 --> 19:20.567
Oh, my God.
Another one.

19:20.567 --> 19:23.167
Great trunks.

19:24.567 --> 19:28.667
Joe:
He has a natural retreat.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.967
Sal, see that guy
in the front there?

19:30.967 --> 19:32.867
Get as close
as you can to him.

19:32.867 --> 19:35.700
Lock eyes with him,
and then just sink underwater.

19:35.700 --> 19:38.100
Joe: Here he goes.

19:38.100 --> 19:40.467
-Look at him, look at him.
-Lock eyes.

19:40.467 --> 19:42.967
-Get creepy, get creepy.
-Lock eyes.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.067
Murr:
Take it, take it!

19:54.200 --> 19:55.133
Nice.

19:57.533 --> 19:58.800
Sal, go stand
next to the instructor.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.600
Go to take a picture
over her shoulder.

20:00.600 --> 20:01.600
Woman: Good.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.833
All right.

20:02.833 --> 20:04.300
Bring your arms up.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.767
Arms way up in the air,
go "Yikers!"

20:06.767 --> 20:08.400
and fall into the pool.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.800
Sal:
Raise them nice and tall.

20:14.933 --> 20:16.100
"Yikers!"

20:19.367 --> 20:21.567
Q: Well done, gentlemen.
Sal: Sorry.

20:21.567 --> 20:23.100
Well done.
Cannonball, fellas. Cannonball.

20:23.100 --> 20:25.400
I feel like such an idiot
right now.

20:30.833 --> 20:32.133
Welcome to
"Impractical Insider."

20:32.133 --> 20:33.567
I'm here
at Astoria Sports Complex,

20:33.567 --> 20:34.800
where Sal just got punished.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.800
Now, I'm gonna give you
a behind-the-scenes look,

20:36.800 --> 20:38.933
because a lot went into this
underwater punishment.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.800
I'm also gonna show you
some bonus content

20:40.800 --> 20:42.233
from tonight's episode.

20:42.233 --> 20:43.300
Check this out.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.867
How often is your shirt off
for taping?

20:45.867 --> 20:46.833
Not enough.

20:46.833 --> 20:48.100
I agree, I agree.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.800
Geoff is not just, like,
playing around in the water.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.500
He's actually trying to put
the camera in the right way

20:56.500 --> 20:58.700
that you can see everything
underwater.

20:58.700 --> 21:02.067
Murr:
Sal, you look so weird.

21:02.067 --> 21:04.600
Yeah, look at this,
washing his hands!

21:04.600 --> 21:06.933
No one gets behind the scenes
like me!

21:06.933 --> 21:09.900
I'm in the bathroom right now
watching him wash his hands.

21:09.900 --> 21:10.900
You know why?
Why?

21:10.900 --> 21:13.067
I just peed.
Yes!

21:13.067 --> 21:14.433
Finding out all the details
on set.

21:14.433 --> 21:16.067
You're welcome, everybody.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.900
Audio is
a huge issue today,

21:17.900 --> 21:19.867
because
it's an underwater shoot.

21:23.533 --> 21:24.833
So, tell me about this.

21:24.833 --> 21:28.067
It's a little waterproof pack
we put an IFB in,

21:28.067 --> 21:30.433
so Sal could hear the guys
in the back.

21:30.433 --> 21:32.300
Murr:
Sal, can you hear us?

21:32.300 --> 21:34.800
Christine: So, I can show you
this is the inside-out.

21:34.800 --> 21:37.467
Casey: This is great.
I sewed two pockets
back here.

21:37.467 --> 21:39.433
So, this will be on his back,

21:39.433 --> 21:40.967
and we can just
run the wires right through

21:40.967 --> 21:42.133
and no one
will be the wiser.

21:42.133 --> 21:44.367
The Impractical Jokers
are about to do the intro

21:44.367 --> 21:46.333
where they tell Sal
what he has to do.

21:46.333 --> 21:47.633
What the

21:48.900 --> 21:50.200
Oh, underwater!

21:51.600 --> 21:55.067
Joe: And there it is.
It's sinking in in stages.

21:55.067 --> 21:58.100
We're seconds away
from Sal's punishment, okay.

21:58.100 --> 22:00.067
He's about to go out.
You want too much.

22:00.067 --> 22:03.733
Yeah,
I'm the Impractical Insider.
He's the Insider.

22:03.733 --> 22:05.867
Are you nervous?
Always.

22:05.867 --> 22:08.300
Sal's gonna be
the creepiest photographer

22:08.300 --> 22:09.533
ever to enter this pool.

22:09.533 --> 22:12.967
Oh, my God.

22:12.967 --> 22:16.267
Q: You look like an Italian
mobster from the 1920s, buddy.

22:16.267 --> 22:17.700
How's it going?

22:17.700 --> 22:18.900
It's going great.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.300
Sal: Yikers!

22:27.100 --> 22:28.833
Well done, gentlemen.
Well done.

22:28.833 --> 22:31.200
What was
the water temperature?

22:31.200 --> 22:32.500
You  kidding me?

22:33.933 --> 22:36.767
It's freezing.
Get out of here.

22:36.767 --> 22:38.300
So, Sal got punished.

22:38.300 --> 22:39.700
But are you okay?

22:39.700 --> 22:43.067
My ribs...my ribs are...

22:43.067 --> 22:46.100
As of this shooting,
I still got the broken ribs.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.300
Aah!

22:47.300 --> 22:48.467
And that was so funny,

22:48.467 --> 22:49.733
that it felt like
I was re-breaking them.

22:49.733 --> 22:50.733
Sal: Whoopsie!

22:55.633 --> 22:57.400
Thanks for watching
"Impractical Insider."

22:57.400 --> 22:59.800
Now, before you go,
we're gonna leave you with this.

23:02.067 --> 23:04.533
Yeah, no, I got Desiree here,
she's still...

23:06.233 --> 23:07.967
Oh, damn it.

23:09.733 --> 23:11.167
I tried
the exercise ball.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.300
Joe: Good, now wake up.

23:16.533 --> 23:17.533
They're ready for you.

23:19.533 --> 23:20.767
Send him back in here.

23:26.133 --> 23:29.100
He did it!
30 minutes!

23:29.100 --> 23:32.733
You are the best person
I never met!

23:32.733 --> 23:33.767
That's amazing!

23:35.400 --> 23:36.633
Yeah, the whole time.

23:36.633 --> 23:38.200
We made him fall asleep
for 30 minutes.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.067
We're like, "There's no way
he's gonna leave."

23:40.067 --> 23:41.833
You were so patient.
Like, I wondered how
long you could take.

23:41.833 --> 23:43.667
Thank you so much.
Thanks, man.

23:46.733 --> 23:48.900
We want you guys
to check out the full, unedited,

23:48.900 --> 23:51.300
30-plus minutes
of Q sleeping.

23:51.300 --> 23:53.267
If you want to do that,
go to this link right here.

23:53.267 --> 23:55.167
If you have nothing to do
for the next half hour or so,

23:55.167 --> 23:56.533
go right here
to kill some time.
